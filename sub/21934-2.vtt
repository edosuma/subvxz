WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:01.902
Previously on Scorpion...

00:01.935 --> 00:05.039
Methane has begun to escape
into the atmosphere.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.775
In 30 days, half of life
on Earth is gone.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.111
In 90, all of it.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.045
I'll ankle Collins to me.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.114
He gets more than
25 feet from my side,

00:13.147 --> 00:14.415
he gets 50,000 volts.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.616
(electric buzzing)
(exclaims, grunts)

00:15.649 --> 00:17.051
If things go sideways,

00:17.085 --> 00:18.252
It'll be your ass
on the line.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.553
PANNS is our marital creed.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.055
"SCABOBI"?

00:21.089 --> 00:22.223
It stands for
"Steady Calm Attitude

00:22.256 --> 00:23.691
Brings Optimal Bliss
Inherently."

00:23.724 --> 00:25.093
Today I read my own obituary.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.627
And the thing that hit the most

00:26.660 --> 00:28.496
was that it didn't
even mention Megan.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.564
I-I lost my-my wedding ring.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.101
Sly, it is a Band-Aid.
I will get you another.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.602
Paige is like fruit punch.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.836
And your brain

00:35.869 --> 00:38.839
is like a Ferrari engine.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.574
As the founder of Scorpion,

00:40.608 --> 00:43.244
I don't really need
to check with anyone.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.245
Appreciate the candor.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.846
WALTER:
Collins got Toby. Pull.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.714
(grunts and groans)

00:46.747 --> 00:48.616
You pulled me out?

00:48.649 --> 00:51.185
Methane geysers,
hundreds of them.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.121
This will start warming
the Earth's atmosphere

00:53.154 --> 00:54.388
within hours and then...

00:54.422 --> 00:56.190
Mass extinction.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.693
CARSON (over phone):
No way our government can
mobilize those resources

00:59.727 --> 01:01.329
to the Arctic
in that time frame.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.331
I don't care how much red tape's
involved, Carson.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.867
We've got tons of ice-gas
shooting through the atmosphere.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.602
It's gonna bake us all to bits.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.605
That is almost
entirely inaccurate.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.207
We have methane
escaping ice fissures,

01:13.241 --> 01:14.875
and it's getting trapped
in the atmosphere.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.311
Now, the "bake us to bits" part
is correct.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.614
Well, Mr. O'Brien, satellite
imagery has made us aware

01:20.648 --> 01:22.883
of a potential geological event
in the region,

01:22.916 --> 01:23.851
it's just...

01:23.884 --> 01:26.187
Not a geological event,
an extinction event.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.855
And there's nothing "potential"
about it.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.124
Now, if we don't get
some government support

01:30.158 --> 01:32.226
to plug those leaks
within three hours,

01:32.260 --> 01:33.327
enough methane will have escaped

01:33.361 --> 01:34.695
to permanently heat
the atmosphere

01:34.728 --> 01:37.298
and end human life
in 90 days tops.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.666
So we're gonna need
three dozen pieces

01:38.699 --> 01:39.533
of heavy construction machinery,

01:39.567 --> 01:41.335
and we'll need 50 workers--
no, no, no--

01:41.369 --> 01:42.870
make that 60 workers.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.739
Mr. O'Brien, there is no way
our government can mobilize

01:45.773 --> 01:48.609
those resources to the Arctic
in that time frame.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.578
Not to mention,
our top scientists

01:50.611 --> 01:52.913
have yet to determine
how much of a threat, if any,

01:52.946 --> 01:54.515
this methane leak is.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.917
Your top scientists
are all with me in Norway.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.752
(phone clicks)
Idiot.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.354
We're on our own.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.923
Nice. Fight the man.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.525
(tires screech)

02:04.558 --> 02:06.660
Why are we stopping here?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.662
CABE: We're far enough
from the methane to be safe,

02:08.696 --> 02:09.597
and I'm not just gonna

02:09.630 --> 02:12.333
drive around blind
until we have a plan.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.935
Walt's got a plan, we're just
a few dozen payloaders short.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.338
How are we gonna stuff up
all those fissures at once?

02:17.371 --> 02:18.939
(high-pitched whirring)

02:18.972 --> 02:20.941
What's that noise?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.210
(helicopter blades whirring)

02:28.316 --> 02:29.950
I've seen classified photos

02:29.983 --> 02:31.585
of that beast
in Homeland briefings.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.821
That's the Russian X-138.

02:33.854 --> 02:37.925
The fastest military
helicopter on Earth.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.929
That is how we're gonna
save the Earth.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.831
We just need to steal it.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.566
I'm not sure all the methane's
out of Walt's bloodstream.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.301
I assure you, I am lucid.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.569
Now, right now, what is
our number one problem?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.838
I'm being forced to work with
a man who tried to murder me.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.241
Eh, I saved your life today,
I'd say we're back to zero.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.843
Our number one problem is how
to quickly and efficiently

02:55.876 --> 02:57.578
cork up the methane fissures.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.679
Exactly. We're gonna
use the helicopter

02:58.712 --> 03:00.581
as our cork dispenser,
we're gonna seed the clouds

03:00.614 --> 03:02.616
above the fissures
to make it snow.

03:02.650 --> 03:05.419
Snow falls into the fissures,
partially clogging them up...

03:05.453 --> 03:06.620
Temperature starts decreasing...

03:06.654 --> 03:07.955
Snow turns to ice...

03:07.988 --> 03:09.557
Totally sealing the fissures...

03:09.590 --> 03:10.691
Completely stopping
the methane release,

03:10.724 --> 03:11.825
the heating of the atmosphere...

03:11.859 --> 03:13.727
And the extinction event.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.563
Government sends a team to pump

03:15.596 --> 03:17.931
methane-eating bacteria
under the ice.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.600
No more worries.
The problem is,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
is that chopper
is most likely headed back

03:21.635 --> 03:23.904
over the Russian border
a few miles from here.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.373
So we have to cross a border?

03:25.406 --> 03:26.940
And steal a military helicopter.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.008
It's not like we can borrow
it from the Russians.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.378
There isn't a lot of trust
between our countries.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.845
Copter was heading northeast.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.248
Most of this border up here
is unprotected.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.616
Why don't we drive
in that direction

03:35.649 --> 03:38.151
and see if we can't find
where it went?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.457
CABE:
Copy that.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.858
(phone clicks)

03:44.892 --> 03:46.960
CIA has a dossier on this place.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.128
It's a luxury spa retreat

03:48.161 --> 03:50.798
for top Russian military,
their families and friends.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.300
Military?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.567
Place is full of top brass

03:53.601 --> 03:55.002
who carry their weapons
at all times.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.037
Okay, what else did they tell
you was in the facility?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.373
It's Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous in there.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.542
The big shots go there
for saltwater pools,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.411
exercise studios, the works.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.412
Perfect.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.579
Why, are you thinking
of a getting a facial?

04:05.613 --> 04:06.714
No. To seed the clouds,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.349
we'll need silver iodide.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.518
Since we don't have
it, we will make it.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.619
We combine potassium iodide...

04:11.652 --> 04:14.655
Which is used as a decontaminant
in saltwater pools.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.789
...with silver nitrate.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.658
Found in the backs of mirrors
to keep them reflective.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.926
But we'll need the helicopter
to seed the clouds.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.993
It's still running
with a pilot at the ready,

04:20.027 --> 04:22.296
it seems like someone's gonna
use it any minute.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.464
CABE: They're using
military assets

04:23.497 --> 04:25.399
to fly around from
the local bases.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.067
But even if we get our hands on
it, who's gonna fly the thing?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.403
I can fly the copter.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.038
Pilot's license, remember?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.307
Oh, yeah, last time you flew us
somewhere, we crashed.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.309
PANNS.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.945
No disparaging of ideas.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.481
First N.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.915
SYLVESTER: We got to
delay whoever's using

04:41.949 --> 04:43.784
the whirlybird next,
so it's still there

04:43.817 --> 04:46.086
after we pilfer all
the chemicals we need.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.689
I speak fluent Russian, guys.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.091
I can get us past
that front desk.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.795
I'm just gonna need,
uh, that metal pen

04:54.828 --> 04:57.698
that you used to take notes
on my research in prison.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.701
Cabe, I'll need you to follow
some very simple instructions,

05:00.734 --> 05:03.704
and Happy, I'll need you
to be my wife.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.673
Come on, Toby.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.776
I'm, like, the only one here
she hasn't been married to.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.977
(Collins chuckles)
Hey!

05:10.010 --> 05:12.380
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, settle down.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.482
Hey, it was a joke. A joke.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.753
Okay. Let's get to work.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.526
(soft piano music playing)

05:27.661 --> 05:29.430
(Collins speaking Russian)

05:31.765 --> 05:34.101
(speaking Russian)

05:42.843 --> 05:43.911
(typing)

06:03.631 --> 06:05.098
Cabe, one large step back.
25 feet.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.934
(electric buzzing)
(exclaims, grunts)

06:08.101 --> 06:09.437
HAPPY:
Uh, coast is clear.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.547
(clerk grunting)

06:23.083 --> 06:25.553
I'm fine. I'm fine, thanks.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.190
Sorry, man.
(muffled shouting)

06:30.223 --> 06:32.726
Here, this must be
the helicopter manifest.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.762
Yeah. What-what was it

06:34.795 --> 06:36.497
that gave it away,
was it the little picture

06:36.530 --> 06:39.099
of the helicopter?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.801
Sorry.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.669
My bad.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.604
Therapy is a marathon,
not a sprint.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.139
Just shut up and read the
schedule, please, Collins.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.776
COLLINS: It says
General Victor Andropov

06:48.809 --> 06:51.078
is scheduled to fly out
in 22 minutes,

06:51.111 --> 06:54.548
right after his seaweed
treatment at the spa.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.984
Spa, okay, so we don't
let him leave the spa.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.620
Uh, Cabe and Collins,
handle that,

06:59.653 --> 07:02.122
Happy, Sly, Toby, uh, get
to the pool maintenance

07:02.155 --> 07:03.924
and grab blocks of
potassium iodide,

07:03.957 --> 07:05.559
and, uh, Paige and I will grab

07:05.593 --> 07:06.794
a bucket
of ice scrapers

07:06.827 --> 07:07.861
that I saw from outside,

07:07.895 --> 07:09.930
and then get the silver nitrate
from some mirrors.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.131
Look at the exercise room.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.566
Entire ceiling is
covered in mirrors.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.601
TOBY:
So was our hotel room

07:13.634 --> 07:16.036
in Santa Barbara, but somehow,
we're in the Arctic.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.237
We don't pull this off,

07:17.270 --> 07:19.106
your honeymoon will
be postponed forever

07:19.139 --> 07:21.842
and we'll all die before
your one month anniversary,

07:21.875 --> 07:22.943
so hands in.

07:22.976 --> 07:23.977
Huh?
Hands in.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.846
It's a sports thing.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.481
You put your hands
in a circle

07:27.515 --> 07:29.182
to get psyched up
for the big game.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.819
Now, the whole world
is counting on us.

07:31.852 --> 07:32.953
Now, hands in.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.490
All right, Scorpion,

07:36.524 --> 07:37.725
on three, ready?
Ready.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.859
One...
Sorry, Collins.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.093
Team members only.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.061
CABE:
Two...

07:41.094 --> 07:42.730
When was the last time
everybody washed up?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.132
Three.
We wasted three
seconds. Let's go.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.607
You got to be kidding me.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.880
(quietly):
Go Scorpion.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.649
Cabe?

08:01.682 --> 08:03.684
*

08:11.024 --> 08:13.594
(speaking Russian)

08:13.627 --> 08:15.629
(dance music playing)

08:24.805 --> 08:27.174
(Paige grunts)

08:27.207 --> 08:29.910
If I knew there'd be this
much vent infiltration

08:29.943 --> 08:33.080
when I took this Scorpion job,
I might've reconsidered.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.115
Oh, yeah. Here is good.

08:35.148 --> 08:38.285
Yeah. That music
should be loud enough

08:38.318 --> 08:40.120
to cover the sound
of our scraping.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.254
Okay.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.322
(music continues playing)

08:42.355 --> 08:43.557
(groans)

08:43.591 --> 08:45.893
What is it?

08:45.926 --> 08:48.596
Nothing, it's just
the, uh, the music.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.063
It's quite, it's inefficient.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.065
Isn't it?
I mean, if calisthenics

08:52.099 --> 08:55.002
is the goal,

08:55.035 --> 08:58.138
you'd get the same result
without the blaring soundtrack.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.608
Music makes it more fun.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.009
Not for the inner ear.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.711
Sensorineural hearing loss

09:03.744 --> 09:05.278
is no laughing matter.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.949
Well, music is not
an intellectual matter.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.350
Some things exist

09:10.383 --> 09:12.285
just to be
enjoyed, Walter.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.589
Not everything's constantly
cerebral, you know?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.292
Well, an increase in the amount
of cerebral activity

09:19.326 --> 09:20.994
would be a boon
to general society.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.932
Of course, yeah, it's just
a... an observation.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.199
Let's continue

09:26.233 --> 09:28.301
with the collection
of the silver nitrate.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.037
(scraping)

09:30.070 --> 09:31.639
You know, fun fact
about silver nitrate.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.675
It's actually used
for certain eye treatments.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.813
It's not that fun
of a fact, actually.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.253
COLLINS: Oh, he's
a big old slab

09:46.286 --> 09:49.122
of Acipenser gueldenstaedtii.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.294
The scientific classification
of Russian sturgeon.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.097
Shut up. I don't want
to hear it.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.669
Hey. Showtime.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.236
Put this on.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.038
A "please" would be nice.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.206
Yeah, so would
a cold beer

10:06.239 --> 10:07.174
and a warm showgirl,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.109
and you're not getting
any of those either.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.210
Grab that hot wax.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.444
We're gonna need it.

10:11.478 --> 10:16.049
The funny thing, Agent, is that
criminals and law enforcement

10:16.083 --> 10:17.350
aren't all that different.

10:17.384 --> 10:20.220
Both highly intelligent.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.822
Both risk-takers.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.224
Yeah, but a criminal
does it for himself.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.159
Cops do it for others.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.128
That's the rub.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.130
I'm working on it.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.365
I'm desperately
hoping to switch up

10:32.399 --> 10:37.705
my 51% bad with
my 49% good.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.273
I would really love to make
that two percent leap.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.977
Well, for right now,
concentrate 100% on the job.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.879
Get into character.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.353
(speaking Russian)

10:59.292 --> 11:00.994
(speaks Russian)

11:24.918 --> 11:26.253
You've got to be kidding me.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.454
It's empty.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.456
They're out of potassium iodide.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.224
Uh, they must be
in between orders.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.359
That means we're in between
a rock and a hard place.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.461
No potassium iodide means
we can't seed the clouds,

11:34.494 --> 11:36.129
make it snow and seal
those methane fissures.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.967
And all life ends,
save for some gross insects.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.434
The bugs haven't won yet.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.070
We've got all the
potassium iodide we'd need.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.171
It's just been dissolved

11:44.204 --> 11:47.240
in over 26,000 gallons of water
right above our heads.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.242
And in order to get salt from
salt water, you need to boil it,

11:49.276 --> 11:51.011
and I don't think they
make a pot big enough

11:51.044 --> 11:52.913
to hold a whole
pool's worth of water!
HAPPY: Ah, right here.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.048
These pipes are hot.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.316
Must be headed
into the steam room.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.419
I can drain the pool water and
redirect it into these pipes.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.188
We crank the heat,
vent the steam,

12:01.221 --> 12:02.790
and all that's left
in the catch basin

12:02.823 --> 12:04.758
is potassium iodide residue.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.059
That works. My
girl is brilliant!

12:06.093 --> 12:07.861
Except how do we protect
the swimmers?

12:07.895 --> 12:10.097
We drain the pool,
we create a suction

12:10.130 --> 12:12.199
that could pin somebody
to the drain. They drown.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.200
Then we clear the pool.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.502
Even if we could come up
with a lie

12:15.535 --> 12:17.404
to tell the swimmers, none of us
speak fluent Russian.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.208
Not if we can get everyone to
leave the pool voluntarily.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.976
This is masked industrial dye.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.377
It's used to expose urine
in the pool.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.779
But if I take a
large chunk of it

12:25.813 --> 12:27.147
and break it up
while no one's looking,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.082
a dark blue cloud's
gonna form all around me

12:29.116 --> 12:30.450
and they're all gonna think
I dropped some lemonade

12:30.483 --> 12:31.384
off at the party,
if you catch my drift.

12:31.418 --> 12:35.355
Your plan is to pee people
out of the pool?

12:35.388 --> 12:37.224
Grab a swimsuit
from the laundry

12:37.257 --> 12:38.358
and while I'm
getting changed,

12:38.391 --> 12:40.527
I'm gonna search for how to say,

12:40.560 --> 12:43.130
"Sorry, I had an accident,"
in Russian.

12:46.033 --> 12:49.302
Sometimes I can't believe
I said, "I do."

12:49.336 --> 12:51.138
(grunting)

13:01.481 --> 13:04.384
(upbeat techno music playing)

13:04.417 --> 13:08.922
Okay. I think that's
the last of it.

13:08.956 --> 13:12.159
Yeah, okay, let's get it into
the bucket 'cause this music

13:12.192 --> 13:14.527
is giving me a headache.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.563
(speaking Russian)

13:24.437 --> 13:27.340
Uh-oh.
(whispering):
Let's go.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.280
Okay, this will heat the water
to about 215 degrees,

13:33.313 --> 13:34.514
more than enough
to turn it into steam.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.583
Okay, all the valves
are prepped for release

13:36.616 --> 13:37.617
for when the pool is empty.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.552
Okay. I'm ready.

13:42.555 --> 13:46.259
You might not need to pretend
to pee to get people to leave.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.061
Come on, that's uncool, man.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.296
This is all I could find.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.931
Is it that bad?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.600
Only bad thing
is how turned on I am.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.535
Can't act on it.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.071
Wish me luck.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.277
Okay, I just broke
the second "N" of PANNS.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.146
No lying.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.187
*

14:37.277 --> 14:38.979
*

14:47.687 --> 14:49.990
(speaks Russian)

14:52.025 --> 14:53.660
(people groaning)

14:59.366 --> 15:02.035
Okay. Coast is clear.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.671
Open the valve.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.377
Pool's draining.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.981
Toby, you forgot the dye pack.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.449
How'd you make
the water turn blue?

15:16.483 --> 15:18.485
I improvised.

15:27.027 --> 15:32.465
Yeah. I think we're
just about done, comrade.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.434
Who are you?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.636
We're the guys that
just made you immobile.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.973
(grunting)

15:40.007 --> 15:41.508
See, when you mix the wax

15:41.541 --> 15:44.577
with the plant proteins
in the seaweed, it makes this...

15:44.611 --> 15:47.714
super-hard candy shell
and you, my friend,

15:47.747 --> 15:49.182
are the sweet inner nougat.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.717
I will have you killed!

15:50.750 --> 15:52.585
I doubt that.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.023
But I might get an
itchy trigger finger.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.557
Now...

15:57.590 --> 15:59.192
you're gonna tell
your copter pilot

15:59.226 --> 16:00.360
that you're not gonna leave

16:00.393 --> 16:02.162
for another hour.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.531
Do that, I stuff a sock
in your mouth,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.034
we leave and no one gets hurt.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.301
And by no one,

16:08.335 --> 16:10.670
I mean you.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.712
Okay, we are over 20,000 gallons
of water.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.448
We should be good.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.682
Opening the basin.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.553
Jackpot.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.720
Cabe, we need you to go

16:27.754 --> 16:29.256
to the loading dock
to get a handcart

16:29.289 --> 16:30.457
so we can move all this.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.193
Copy that.
We're on our way.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.694
(muffled shouting)

16:34.727 --> 16:39.032
SYLVESTER: That's more than
enough potassium iodide.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.733
Man, it's hot as
hell in here.
Oh, you think?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.102
Okay, you guys take
care of that stuff.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.337
I am gonna go hijack
the helicopter.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.207
Hey, that-that pilot is armed,
so I know you can outsmart him,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.542
but you can't outsmart a bullet,
so please be careful.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.111
Copy that.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.382
Now that you are all dressed,
I am kind of missing the speedo.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.752
I still got it.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.224
You and Happy,
I'm glad for you.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.427
Oh, thanks, pal.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.362
You know, Happy told me
about how you're feeling

17:09.396 --> 17:11.464
with the, uh, obit
leaving Megan out and all.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.833
That was a methane-induced
confession.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.135
She shouldn't
have told you that.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.603
Oh, well, when
you're married,

17:16.636 --> 17:18.305
telling one spouse
is telling both.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.774
Yeah, that's the thing.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.243
You and Happy are married.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.112
And Cabe

17:25.145 --> 17:26.546
found Allie.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.381
Now Walter and Paige
are together.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.118
It's just...

17:31.151 --> 17:33.820
what do you do when you lose
your one true love?

17:33.853 --> 17:38.791
Sly, you have an opportunity
that almost no one ever gets.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.261
You read your obituary
and now you can change it.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.596
Who is to say that true love
only comes around once?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.132
Maybe true love
is like a boomerang.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.300
Boomerangs do
only come around once.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.368
Point is, nothing
in the universe

17:48.401 --> 17:49.469
says that you can't
find love again.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.539
And-and then one day, your
obituary is gonna read,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.441
"Sylvester Dodd
was a man so great

17:54.474 --> 17:56.876
that two wonderful women
fell for him."

17:56.909 --> 17:59.246
That's only gonna happen
if the world doesn't end,

17:59.279 --> 18:00.513
so can we pick up
the pace, please?

18:00.547 --> 18:02.415
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.161
Hey, walk a little
closer to me.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.897
Block the bucket in
case anybody passes.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.399
Oh, no.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.302
Here, sit in the chair.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.337
Sit in the chair.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.807
Ow.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.809
Ow. Ow!

18:29.842 --> 18:31.578
What, are you trying to pierce
my skin with your thumbs?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.146
No, it's deep-tissue
manipulation.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.247
It breaks up the fascia tissue.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.586
(speaks Russian)

18:39.619 --> 18:41.621
(speaks Spanish)

18:42.889 --> 18:44.891
(speaks Spanish)

18:46.859 --> 18:47.860
Oh.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.798
(speaking Spanish)

19:06.879 --> 19:08.315
(starts to speak Spanish)

19:09.982 --> 19:11.251
Ow.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.273
Tú también.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.381
What the heck were you doing?

19:41.414 --> 19:43.416
I was... pleasuring you.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.419
Wh-What husband doesn't know
his wife has a bad shoulder?

19:46.453 --> 19:48.355
Now they're gonna
be suspicious.
Well, I mean, they left.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.856
How suspicious could they be?

19:50.857 --> 19:51.891
(shouts in Russian)

19:51.924 --> 19:53.726
Run, run.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.264
Happy, what's your status?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.399
Married.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.967
You were there, remember?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.802
TOBY:
Come on, what's going on?
Okay.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.704
I've got the pilot in my sight.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.606
I'm just gonna lead him
to the back of the copter

20:06.639 --> 20:08.475
and knock him out
with a concussive blast

20:08.508 --> 20:10.477
from the exhaust,

20:10.510 --> 20:14.747
all for the low, low price
of 17 cents.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.519
(coins clattering)

20:40.607 --> 20:42.475
HAPPY: Crap.
Everything is in Cyrillic.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.511
You didn't anticipate that

20:44.544 --> 20:46.279
when you were getting
into a Russian helicopter?

20:46.313 --> 20:48.448
Uh, I thought things would be
in their standard spots,

20:48.481 --> 20:49.616
but this is some
kind of high-tech,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.484
experimental machinery.

20:51.518 --> 20:52.552
Okay, here goes.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
Double crap.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.728
Abraham Lincoln?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.496
Okay, this should be
the exhaust port.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.664
Second time's the charm.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.643
What the hell was that?

21:16.676 --> 21:18.978
What the hell was that?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.780
Happy? What the hell was that?

21:20.813 --> 21:25.318
I accidentally made Russia
declare war on Norway. My bad.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.058
Good news? I'm getting really
good at hog-tying people.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.561
The bad news is:

21:34.594 --> 21:39.499
the pilot's walkie is blowing up
with Russkie chatter.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.368
Sounds like I rattled 'em
pretty good.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.035
I believe we need to get
out of this spa

21:43.069 --> 21:45.004
as soon as humanly possible.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.005
Uh, Walter.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.675
Our barrel of potassium iodide
is nearly full.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.510
Where is the silver nitrate?
WALTER: The silver nitrate's

21:50.543 --> 21:52.111
on its way, but we
need to dissolve it

21:52.144 --> 21:53.346
in water to
seed the clouds.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.615
Well, then it needs to be peanut
buttered with our chocolate.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.584
And that'll take a second, too.
PAIGE: Yeah, well, I'm not sure

21:57.617 --> 21:58.651
we're gonna have
all the seconds we need.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.586
We've got guards chasing us

21:59.619 --> 22:00.953
and I think they just came
onto our floor.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.423
Here, here, here, here.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.793
Okay, just get your butts
and cloud cocktail

22:06.826 --> 22:08.428
to this platform
and I will get us out of here.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.666
Um...

22:13.700 --> 22:15.468
You have no idea how to
fly that thing, do you?

22:15.502 --> 22:18.671
I'm-I'm just a little gun-shy.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.906
Literally.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.941
Boots, Toby, many boots running.

22:21.974 --> 22:22.975
Cabe? Guards are coming.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.411
Get out of there!

22:24.444 --> 22:27.146
Collins and I
will get the iodide salt

22:27.179 --> 22:29.749
and bring it to the helipad
via the service elevator.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.684
You heard the man.
Let's vamoose.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.558
(speaking Russian)

22:52.004 --> 22:54.441
(door creaks)

22:54.474 --> 22:57.644
CABE: Use your legs.
One, two, three, lift.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.045
Use your legs, genius.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.480
Almost on. Push.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.014
(yells)

23:02.048 --> 23:04.083
Hey, hey, hey.
Keep it down!

23:04.116 --> 23:06.185
Oh, my ankle.
Oh, man, my ankle.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.087
(groaning)
How bad?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.489
(groans):
I don't know.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.523
It hurts like hell.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.558
(moans)

23:11.591 --> 23:13.192
All right, well, come on.
Try to stand on it.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.127
Yeah. (groans)

23:15.161 --> 23:17.564
(yells)
Nope. Nope.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.666
It's like a knife in my tendon.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.000
All right.

23:21.033 --> 23:21.934
Let's go. Get on.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.471
You're riding on the cart
from here on out.

23:24.504 --> 23:28.207
Okay. Oh, nothing
suspicious about this.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.876
(console trilling)

23:29.909 --> 23:31.644
Honey?

23:31.678 --> 23:34.481
Gonna need to be airborne
real soon.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.215
I'm getting the
hang of it.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.886
(console beeping)

23:39.919 --> 23:43.155
Not an expert here, but that
rotor needs to be moving faster.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.858
Uh, this either guns the
engine or dumps the fuel.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.193
Well, what the hell?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.129
(rotor whirring)

23:50.162 --> 23:51.197
Eureka!

23:51.230 --> 23:53.933
Guys, we're cooking
up here. ETA?

23:53.966 --> 23:56.035
Nothing at the moment.
HAPPY: Cabe?

23:56.068 --> 23:58.938
So, almost at
the service elevator.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.180
There's a guard at the elevator.

24:08.214 --> 24:10.517
All right,
the elevator's not an option.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.118
(sighs)

24:12.151 --> 24:14.186
We can't take the stairs
'cause the barrel's too heavy

24:14.220 --> 24:15.688
and Collins can barely walk.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.490
Yeah, and we're stuck
in a linen closet.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.791
We need a plan fast.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.727
You got something?

24:20.760 --> 24:23.530
Was it really that bad
of a massage?

24:23.563 --> 24:25.231
That's what you're thinking
about right now?

24:25.264 --> 24:26.866
No, it's just
we're together, so...

24:26.899 --> 24:28.200
things are meant
to be effortless,

24:28.234 --> 24:29.836
but I couldn't even
convince the manager

24:29.869 --> 24:31.270
that we were an actual couple.
That's a problem.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.540
Right?
(sighs)

24:36.108 --> 24:37.276
Does that feel
real enough to you?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.144
Yes.
Good.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.012
Russian hotel managers
and Mark Collins

24:40.046 --> 24:41.814
do not determine if we are
a real couple or not.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.650
We do. So get your head
back in the game

24:43.683 --> 24:44.884
and figure out a solution.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.218
(quietly):
Okay.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.090
SYLVESTER:
Uh, guys?

24:51.123 --> 24:52.859
(shouts in Russian)

24:52.892 --> 24:55.695
(gunshots)

24:55.728 --> 24:59.766
We're taking fire here!
We're under fire!

24:59.799 --> 25:01.000
Okay, we are still okay;

25:01.033 --> 25:02.602
this thing is known
to be bulletproof.

25:02.635 --> 25:03.970
(bullets ricocheting)

25:04.003 --> 25:05.705
More like bullet-resistant.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.139
WALTER:
Happy, get out of there.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.008
Okay. Here goes nothing!

25:11.878 --> 25:12.879
We're getting there.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.817
(Sylvester yells)

25:17.850 --> 25:19.852
TOBY:
Is another part

25:19.886 --> 25:21.220
of this helicopter's
secret powers

25:21.253 --> 25:23.122
that it only flies sideways?

25:23.155 --> 25:24.557
I am figuring it out.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.560
(yelps)

25:32.298 --> 25:34.734
(laughs)

25:34.767 --> 25:36.636
See? Easy.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.839
Now, Cabe,
as soon as our guard is gone,

25:39.872 --> 25:41.641
we will meet you and Collins
at the valet,

25:41.674 --> 25:43.242
we'll steal a ride,
and we'll meet up with you.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.111
No, we're closer to
the Arctic van we stashed

25:45.144 --> 25:46.579
behind the Dumpsters.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.748
We'll grab that.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.717
What's the plan, Walt?
Since we didn't have time

25:50.750 --> 25:52.218
to mix the aqueous solution
with the chopper,

25:52.251 --> 25:55.287
we are gonna let the chopper
mix the solution for us.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.123
Lost.
First, we are gonna

25:57.156 --> 25:59.358
launch the silver nitrate
into the cloud.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.260
How?
It's an assault copter,

26:01.293 --> 26:03.730
I assume that it has
surface-to-air missiles?

26:03.763 --> 26:04.764
Oh.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.633
Yeah, roger that.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.636
WALTER: Now, Happy,
you're gonna fly the helicopter

26:09.669 --> 26:10.837
in large circles
to create a vortex

26:10.870 --> 26:12.639
that will dissolve
the silver nitrate

26:12.672 --> 26:14.273
into the cloud's
water vapor.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.809
Then all it needs
is the potassium iodide.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.778
Which we will introduce
via grenade launcher,

26:18.811 --> 26:21.080
which you, Cabe,
will have positioned downwind.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.182
Once airborne,
it'll all mix in the sky,

26:23.215 --> 26:24.917
forming silver iodide crystals.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.786
The water will then freeze

26:26.819 --> 26:28.020
around the crystals
and it'll snow,

26:28.054 --> 26:30.022
plugging the methane leaks.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.124
Sounds good. Then all we need
to do is get to the valet.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.926
It's too risky to leave.
I haven't seen a shadow

26:33.960 --> 26:35.361
from his feet
in a while.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.729
We have no choice
but to take a chance.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.130
I prefer certainty
over risk.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.866
I prefer not to
die in a closet.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.034
Look, I get it.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.235
We are different people,
but we need to

26:43.269 --> 26:45.271
get the hell out of here and
nothing is ever 100% certain.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.942
(door unlocks)

26:53.212 --> 26:55.047
It's 100% certain
we're screwed.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.154
Come with me.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.956
Okay, but we need

27:03.990 --> 27:05.858
to bring
this with us.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.393
It explains why we're here.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.795
You'll want to see
what's in it.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.030
That's not gonna
be possible.

27:12.431 --> 27:15.201
(guard yells, groans)

27:15.234 --> 27:16.769
What'd you do to him?

27:16.803 --> 27:17.804
Kicked him in the gooty. Run.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.910
Uh, snookums?

27:23.943 --> 27:27.246
I'm, uh, trying to shave
the fuses on the explosives

27:27.279 --> 27:29.281
so they detonate
exactly where we want.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.416
So steady, please,

27:30.449 --> 27:32.151
or you're gonna
be a widow

27:32.184 --> 27:34.153
before the end
of the honeymoon.

27:34.186 --> 27:37.223
I am doing my best,
which you might understand

27:37.256 --> 27:40.693
if you were being
a little bit more SCABOBI.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.428
Excuse me?
Of the two of us,

27:42.461 --> 27:45.164
I am unquestionably
more SCABOBI.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.999
Based on present wind speed

27:47.033 --> 27:49.201
and dispersal rates
of the helicopter blades,

27:49.235 --> 27:52.471
Cabe, Walter, you need to
launch these chemicals

27:52.504 --> 27:55.107
from points exactly two miles
apart from each other.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.376
We'll drop the launchers
and the ammo.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.211
Sending you the coordinates now.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.947
(yells)

28:02.949 --> 28:05.417
Air pocket.
Totally routine.

28:08.821 --> 28:09.789
(exhales loudly)

28:09.822 --> 28:12.024
Got the coordinates.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.025
(engine starts)

28:13.059 --> 28:14.026
(tires squeal)

28:14.060 --> 28:16.162
And we'll get to our coordinates

28:16.195 --> 28:17.997
as soon as we get a ride.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.235
(engine starts)

28:25.271 --> 28:26.873
Now, now.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.781
(car alarm chirps)

28:34.814 --> 28:36.215
All right? Yeah.
Yeah.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.157
So no one can follow us.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.028
(engine starts)

28:49.061 --> 28:51.130
(tires squealing)

28:52.799 --> 28:54.100
Your coats.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.334
COLLINS: It's freezing
on the tundra.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.368
Be careful.
Good luck!

28:56.402 --> 28:58.437
You, too.
Hey.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.840
I just wanted to say,
if this high-odds plan

29:00.873 --> 29:03.976
does work,
maybe you guys can, too.

29:05.544 --> 29:06.979
(man shouts in Russian)

29:07.013 --> 29:09.015
(gunfire)
(tires squeal)

29:14.486 --> 29:16.222
Careful.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.290
All right.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.525
First launcher
ready to drop.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.294
We're over
Walt's coordinates now.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.405
We're on our way.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.241
Cabe, once you get
to your rocket launcher,

29:35.274 --> 29:37.443
unscrew the detonator caps,
empty the gunpowder,

29:37.476 --> 29:40.046
and replace it
with the potassium iodide.

29:40.079 --> 29:43.149
The gunpowder residue is enough
to explode the rocket,

29:43.182 --> 29:45.451
which will disperse the salt
and silver into the clouds.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.953
Our drop spot.
Ooh.

29:51.023 --> 29:51.958
Okay, guys, I'm guessing

29:51.991 --> 29:54.126
we're minutes
from the point of no return.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.797
We found our rockets.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.404
We're over
Cabe's coordinates now.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.042
(groans)

30:10.076 --> 30:12.478
50 yards from the launch spot.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.080
But there's a fissure
in the ice.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.181
We can't drive over it.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.884
We're gonna have to run for it.
All right, come on.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.287
Okay, I got it, I got it.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.594
Come on,
let's go.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.329
Let's go. Come on!

30:30.362 --> 30:31.330
Come on, Collins!

30:31.363 --> 30:33.332
Hey, wait, hold up!
(groans)

30:33.365 --> 30:35.234
(groans)

30:35.267 --> 30:37.904
(yells)
God!

30:37.937 --> 30:40.306
(groaning)

30:40.339 --> 30:42.374
(groaning continues)
Wait!

30:43.976 --> 30:44.776
(yells)

30:44.810 --> 30:47.113
(electricity buzzing)
(screaming)

30:47.146 --> 30:49.315
Hey, Cabe!
Collins!

30:49.348 --> 30:51.650
Come back!
(groans)

30:51.683 --> 30:53.085
(gasping)

30:53.119 --> 30:55.087
Collins, you
got to keep up.

30:55.121 --> 30:56.923
We're talking the
end of the Earth.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.358
I'm well aware of that,
but I-I can't with my ankle.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.027
Come on, we got to get
to the drop spot

31:01.060 --> 31:02.028
and launch the rockets.

31:02.061 --> 31:04.396
Okay. Just-just go.

31:04.430 --> 31:08.100
The shocks are torture,
but the amperage won't kill me.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.668
You heard the man, Cabe.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.371
I can't just leave the guy
writhing in agony.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.006
Then take off
his stun cuff.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.107
He's not gonna
run anywhere.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.609
If I uncuff him
without a direct order,

31:17.643 --> 31:20.112
I violate a half a dozen
federal statutes.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.114
Cabe, what we're doing
is more important.

31:22.148 --> 31:23.950
We don't have time for this.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.386
All right.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.257
If you screw me...

31:31.290 --> 31:32.524
I won't.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.294
(cuff clicks)

31:36.695 --> 31:38.530
I am into circular
flight pattern.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.166
I'm gonna start
churning the air.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.275
Our first rocket's ready.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.110
Now or never, guys!

31:52.244 --> 31:53.279
First rocket's away.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.014
(explosion in distance)

31:55.047 --> 31:56.582
SYLVESTER: The silver nitrate
is registering

31:56.615 --> 31:58.250
on the meteorological gauge.

31:58.284 --> 31:59.952
It's dissolving
into water vapor!

31:59.986 --> 32:02.388
We need to add
the potassium iodide!

32:02.421 --> 32:05.657
(Cabe panting)

32:05.691 --> 32:06.993
Cabe, let her rip.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.062
Seconds away.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.341
Collins!

32:24.376 --> 32:26.312
Sorry, Gallo.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.448
That two percent
makes all the difference.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.716
What's going on?

32:30.749 --> 32:32.151
Collins was faking it.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.219
He's running to the truck.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.021
Just let him run.
You have the key to the truck,

32:35.054 --> 32:36.088
I have the spare.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.326
Son of a...

32:40.359 --> 32:42.661
Here, let's move
that wet jacket.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.334
He took the key
when we were changing clothes.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.236
Bastard.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.105
(whoops)

32:53.139 --> 32:56.408
Be well, Team Scorpion!

32:56.442 --> 32:58.444
(laughs, whoops)

33:03.449 --> 33:05.251
Cabe, there's nothing
you can do about Collins.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.352
You need to fire the missiles.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.557
Soon as you're done
seeding, Happy,

33:11.590 --> 33:15.694
we're using that attack copter
to track him down.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.762
HAPPY:
Copy that.

33:19.231 --> 33:20.599
All right, it could be soon.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.368
Just fired the last rocket.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.336
Me, too.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.607
I'm seeing a lot of evidence
of cloud seeding.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.608
This last pass should do it.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.148
(rocket launcher clatters)

33:39.251 --> 33:42.588
Guys, snow.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.190
(Walter laughs)

33:44.223 --> 33:45.724
It's a lot of snow.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.759
(laughing): It's
a lot of snow.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.763
It's working!

33:51.797 --> 33:53.532
Total whiteout
on the ice fields.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.267
Snow will fill the fissures,

33:55.301 --> 33:57.469
freeze up and then stop
all the leaks.

33:57.503 --> 33:58.637
Then Homeland gets
a new drill up here,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.572
they pump in
methane-eating bacteria,

34:00.606 --> 34:02.341
and we head out of Dodge.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.176
Easy-peasy.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.548
Doc, when you said
"total whiteout,"

34:09.581 --> 34:13.285
does that mean you can't see
the road from the sky?

34:13.319 --> 34:15.321
Yeah, visibility's
basically nil.

34:15.354 --> 34:18.690
Meaning no way of
tracking Collins.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.660
He is a crafty sociopath.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.266
Prisoner engaged in acts
throughout the day

34:27.299 --> 34:28.400
aimed at his planned escape.

34:28.434 --> 34:31.470
TOBY: I'm certain now that
he dropped me in the drink

34:31.503 --> 34:33.572
on purpose so he could
get my clothes off.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.209
Uh, uh, to get my keys.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.678
He took an opportunity
to play mind games on everyone.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.880
It culminated in
the feigned injury.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.750
As a result, to avoid the
shock torture of the prisoner,

34:44.783 --> 34:46.252
I disabled his cuff.

34:46.285 --> 34:47.819
I-I was the one
who suggested it.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.188
I unlocked it.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.289
I set him loose.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.758
Was this whole thing a ruse?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.260
The extinction event?

34:54.293 --> 34:57.396
No, that was very real,
and has been averted.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.598
The likely scenario is, is
that Collins has been waiting

34:59.631 --> 35:02.268
for something big to come
along to get us involved.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.136
Knowing security would be loose.

35:04.170 --> 35:06.438
Not loose, Cabe had that yutz
on his hip all day.

35:06.472 --> 35:09.708
And the six billion ruble
Russian attack helicopter?

35:09.741 --> 35:10.576
Ditched it in Norway.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.911
W-We did leave a note
on the windshield,

35:12.944 --> 35:16.782
said, uh, "Thank you for the
loaner, your friend, America."

35:16.815 --> 35:18.317
So all's well that ends well.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.288
Thank you for the debriefing,
Agent Gallo.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.158
I screwed up.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.227
H-Hey, hey.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.929
Do not second-guess prioritizing
the fate of the world

35:30.962 --> 35:32.764
over a scheming lunatic.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.800
It's the military man in me.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.169
When your superior officer
gives you that icy stare,

35:37.203 --> 35:38.870
you know the conversation
ain't finished.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.439
WALTER: I told
you to do it,

35:40.472 --> 35:41.707
I will take the heat.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.809
Interpol has Collins'

35:43.842 --> 35:45.377
photo and prints.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.579
He's got no money or ID.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.615
We'll get him back,
I-I'm confident of that.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.188
Didn't you say
you have a date

35:56.222 --> 35:57.623
with Allie?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.625
You're right.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.627
I'm gonna pick up some takeout
from Kovelsky's,

36:01.660 --> 36:03.595
curl up with my girl,

36:03.629 --> 36:06.632
try to forget about today
for a while.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.372
(door opens, closes)

36:13.405 --> 36:17.476
TOBY: Personally, Collins
on the loose has me terrified.

36:17.509 --> 36:21.213
He lied to me flawlessly
and he had us questioning PANNS

36:21.247 --> 36:22.881
from P all the way to SCABOBI.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.951
Yeah, maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.688
I know I was a co-drafter
of the PANNS document,

36:29.721 --> 36:31.690
but I don't think
we need a marital creed.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.892
We just survived
the stressors

36:33.925 --> 36:35.561
of a catastrophic world event

36:35.594 --> 36:37.963
while working with
a psycho who tried to kill you.

36:37.996 --> 36:39.565
And we're still together.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.767
I'd say our marriage
is pretty resilient.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.236
I'd say you're pretty fantastic.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.238
That being said,
Collins gives me

36:46.272 --> 36:48.774
the willies,
so for a romantic night in,

36:48.807 --> 36:51.777
how about we install
security cameras and an alarm?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.446
Be still, my heart.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.881
Let's do it.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.450
Two seconds.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.755
Hey. Made you something.

37:03.789 --> 37:04.790
Hey.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.759
A ring?

37:07.793 --> 37:08.994
It's a Lucite mold,

37:09.027 --> 37:12.864
with strips of your original
wedding Band-Aid layered inside.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.369
You didn't slip off the rope
when Paige was pulling you up.

37:17.403 --> 37:20.038
You intentionally went

37:20.071 --> 37:23.609
back into the crevasse,
facing great peril.

37:23.642 --> 37:27.913
I know how much it meant to you.
Now it's permanent.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.282
No need to replace
it every day.

37:30.316 --> 37:33.352
One less thing to worry about
as you plot your new path

37:33.385 --> 37:36.288
and rewrite that
future obituary of yours?

37:36.322 --> 37:39.725
Oh. Toby told you
about our talk.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.960
I guess you guys tell each other
everything now.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.695
Kind of, yeah.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.998
Well, I already know
what my new obituary will say.

37:47.032 --> 37:50.436
"Sylvester Dodd.

37:50.469 --> 37:53.339
He had the very best friends."

37:58.109 --> 38:00.312
Thank you, Happy.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.415
I picked up
those blintzes you like.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.584
Listen, are you sure
you want to stay in?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.386
Because I'm willing to go out.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.520
All right, well,
if I fall asleep

38:08.554 --> 38:10.722
on the couch or something...

38:10.756 --> 38:13.359
just throw a shoe at me.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.929
Director Carson.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.532
Agent Gallo, you're under arrest
for instigating an escape.

38:20.566 --> 38:22.534
(laughing):
You got to be kidding me.

38:22.568 --> 38:24.503
Gun and badge.
The option
was the end

38:24.536 --> 38:26.672
of humanity.
You would've preferred that?

38:26.705 --> 38:28.874
Gun and badge.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.075
I want a lawyer.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.078
Gonna need one.

38:42.721 --> 38:43.722
Hey.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.626
Walt, will you
get me my drink?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.861
I left it in there
the other day.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.897
Mm-hmm.

38:56.802 --> 38:57.969
Is that, um...

38:58.003 --> 38:59.104
Uh, fruit punch.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.873
I had the juice place
make it for me.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.875
Mm. Still perfect.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.411
(chuckles)

39:05.444 --> 39:06.578
(exhaling sharply)

39:06.612 --> 39:08.614
Fermented fish.

39:08.647 --> 39:10.348
It's the best.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.822
What are you thinking about?

39:18.590 --> 39:21.560
Uh, stuff Collins said.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.697
Me, too.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.534
Yeah, he said some
incendiary things,

39:28.567 --> 39:33.939
but that, in retrospect,
given his true motive-- escape--

39:33.972 --> 39:36.975
I don't think he said anything
that was an honest observation.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.177
Yeah, yeah, he was just trying
to get in our heads.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.546
Yeah, it was to distract us.

39:40.579 --> 39:41.447
And if Collins thinks
he can divide us

39:41.480 --> 39:42.714
with his lies,

39:42.748 --> 39:44.483
then he is not the genius
we think he is.

39:44.516 --> 39:45.884
Yeah, he's a pretty
stupid genius.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.919
(laughs softly)

39:53.925 --> 39:55.994
Give me a swig of that, and...

39:56.027 --> 39:58.029
Swigging and...

40:03.201 --> 40:04.736
Mm.

40:04.770 --> 40:05.871
I love fruit punch.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.172
You know what? I'm starving.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.444
Mm, I love... fermented...

40:13.745 --> 40:14.846
Uh...

40:14.880 --> 40:16.114
Yeah.
Uh-- no, I can't.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.049
Good? No?

40:21.520 --> 40:22.788
I appreciate the effort.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.858
Walter, kiss me.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.706
Fish breath?
Yeah, me, too.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.741
I don't care.
Me neither. Mm.
