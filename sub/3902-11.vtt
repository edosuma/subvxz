WEBVTT

00:08.909 --> 00:13.247
( helicopter hovering )

00:13.347 --> 00:14.615
How many bags
you got?

00:14.715 --> 00:16.817
C'mon, c'mon!

00:16.917 --> 00:18.152
( camera clicking )

00:18.252 --> 00:19.787
Another bag here.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.295
Christ.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.632
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.937
Who are
the primaries?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.006
Cole and Norris.

00:39.107 --> 00:42.910
Cole's here and Norris
is at the hospital.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.579
What do you need?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.381
Room to work.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.350
I keep ordering people
off the scene,

00:49.450 --> 00:51.519
and between narcotics,
DEA and the two districts,

00:51.619 --> 00:55.089
we keep collecting more
and more bodies around here.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.591
Nobody move!

00:58.526 --> 01:01.529
I said,
nobody fucking move!

01:03.297 --> 01:05.233
If you have not been
assigned a specific task

01:05.333 --> 01:06.600
by a homicide detective,

01:06.700 --> 01:10.638
you need to step away
from this crime scene.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.474
Is there anybody doesn't
understand a direct order?

01:15.376 --> 01:18.279
If you have not specifically
been instructed otherwise,

01:18.379 --> 01:23.083
then remove your useless
interfering asses from the area.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.387
Now!

01:30.424 --> 01:31.892
Slow this thing down
to a crawl.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.828
Give these bastards no chance
to fuck up in a meaningful way.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.299
Okay.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.833
Aah!

01:42.503 --> 01:44.071
Wedged all the way
to the back.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.740
She couldn't
get to it.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.209
Well, she taped it
up front,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.344
but as soon as
she put any weight

01:50.444 --> 01:52.180
on these
worn-ass car seats,

01:52.280 --> 01:53.714
they pulled
the tape off.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.484
Gun slid back behind the mesh
as they drove, probably.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.752
Christ.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.923
Where was
her support?

02:03.023 --> 02:04.892
There were
two follow cars,

02:04.992 --> 02:06.294
they were several
blocks distant.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.162
I think she got turned
around in the alleys,

02:08.262 --> 02:10.431
she gave her 20
as the north side
of Warwick.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.032
They went there
on the shots?

02:12.132 --> 02:16.270
This, uh... Foxtrot
finally found her.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.007
So, we had two units
covering the north side

02:20.107 --> 02:21.509
and a helicopter
up on top.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.412
And no one saw
any vehicles in flight.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.416
( police radio chatter )

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074

02:38.826 --> 02:40.694
Bunk.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.630
Terry, Mike, c'mon.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.438
What the fuck
happened?

03:16.964 --> 03:20.768
( theme music playing )

03:22.870 --> 03:25.406
* If you walk
through the garden *

03:26.740 --> 03:30.444
* You better
watch your back *

03:30.544 --> 03:34.515
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

03:34.615 --> 03:36.950
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

03:38.619 --> 03:39.887
* If you walk
through Jesus *

03:42.290 --> 03:45.959
* He'll save your soul

03:46.059 --> 03:49.730
* You gotta
keep the devil *

03:49.830 --> 03:53.033
* Down in the hole

03:53.133 --> 03:56.604
* All the angels sing

03:56.704 --> 03:57.905
* About Jesus' mighty soul

04:00.774 --> 04:03.344
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

04:04.612 --> 04:05.913
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

04:08.316 --> 04:12.085
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

04:12.185 --> 04:16.023
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

04:16.123 --> 04:19.560
* You got to
keep the devil *

04:19.660 --> 04:23.397
* Way down in the hole

04:31.305 --> 04:33.874
* Way down in the hole

04:35.275 --> 04:37.378
* Way down in the hole

04:39.012 --> 04:42.450
* Way down in the hole

04:42.550 --> 04:45.619
* Way down in the hole.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.327
You didn't
have an eyeball?

04:53.427 --> 04:55.195
On those streets,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.297
there's no way
you can eyeball it.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.199
She was throwing out 20s
as best she could.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.734
Understood,
I'm just asking.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.871
The link we have to this
is Savino Bratton.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.606
A minor lieutenant
to our target, Barksdale.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.575
I gave your people
all that at the scene.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.643
And we're hitting
his last knowns.
We're on that.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.244
The set-up
was more than him.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.346
Casings are
different calibers,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.448
and her Glock
was full up, so...

05:16.116 --> 05:17.651
How bad?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.087
Chest wound, no exit.
Through-and-through
to the throat.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.221
She wasn't stabilized.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.923
They had the pressure
pants on her.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.392
Trying to push up
the pulse.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.326
They put those pants
on you, it ain't good.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.263
Right.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.232
So, you're on Baker
when you hear the shots.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.834
Where was the second car?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.403
Um, Warwick, I think.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.304
Okay. You've got everything
to the east well-covered

05:37.405 --> 05:38.806
and to the west
is the railbed.

05:38.906 --> 05:39.807
What did Foxtrot see?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.975
Nothing moving
except our units.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.577
Lieutenant...

05:43.677 --> 05:45.813
I know just
how you feel.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.616
This is the toughest job
a police commissioner has.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.984
I don't think
I'll ever get used to it.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.353
Um, this is
Lieutenant Daniels.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.023
Oh, right,
right, of course.

05:57.891 --> 06:02.530
This entire department
stands behind Detective Greggs

06:02.630 --> 06:05.198
in every
possible way.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.768
I just thought
you should know that.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.503
Yes, sir.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.440
P.A. system:
...please report to room 12.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.908
Please report
to room 12.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.879
Jaybird.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.421
We have a runner.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.491
Yeah, we're gonna need casts
of these two imprints.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.292
Put the lab tech on.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.728
11-39.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.967
It's not that the money
is anyone's primary concern.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.069
I understand that.
I'm not going to be
standing here

06:42.169 --> 06:44.438
giving a shit about the money
when you people have lost...

06:44.538 --> 06:46.373
well, one of your own
who might...

06:46.474 --> 06:48.041
I mean, Jesus,
this is awful.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.343
On the other hand,
if we can get to this
Savino character quick--

06:50.444 --> 06:52.480
Hey!

06:52.580 --> 06:54.815
Fuck your money.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.959
Jimmy?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.765
You hurt?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.501
No.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.739
It's hers.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.745
C'mon, get up.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.814
Let's go,
up with you.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.716
C'mon.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.057
Couldn't talk,
couldn't breathe.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.692
Nothing.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.127
She went into
the ambo that way.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.964
Is she, uh...

07:47.701 --> 07:49.236
what the fuck did I do?

07:49.336 --> 07:51.672
C'mon, walk.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.209
What's that?

08:09.623 --> 08:10.824
What's our plan, Ray?

08:10.924 --> 08:12.826
Bunk and Jay
stay with the scene.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.628
Keeley and Crutchfield
are at the office

08:14.728 --> 08:16.163
typing the warrants
for this Savino fuck.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.397
Who's on the autopsy?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.632
Me, I'm at the morgue.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.868
Norris and Holley
stay at shock trauma

08:20.968 --> 08:22.536
in case she sits up
and talks.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.304
We're laser printing
the car, right?

08:24.404 --> 08:26.473
'Course,
Worden's on that.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.175
You're in command
for the city, right?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.944
Major Rawls, homicide.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.946
Anything you need
from my office,

08:33.046 --> 08:35.582
men, money, whatever,
you just ask.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.952
Right.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.796
Cooperator, your girl's
down shock trauma.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.167
Let's get to work.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.368
Fuck you.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.137
Fuck me?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.439
- We got a wire up.
- So?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.875
So we got a wire up
on some motherfucker
that just shot a cop.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.177
If somebody talks,
if somebody gets
on the wrong phone

09:04.277 --> 09:06.546
and says the wrong
fuckin' thing about what
happened here tonight,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
where the fuck
do you want to be?!

09:10.984 --> 09:12.586
Church roof?

09:12.686 --> 09:14.755
Yeah, you and me.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.824
Sydnor takes
the McCulloh street phone.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.793
Anybody get in contact
with Kima's people?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.863
Shit.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.266
I'll do that first,
meet you at the church.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.652
Bunk, Mike.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.369
Wonder who
that bitch was.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.271
Always some shit, right?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.173
Yeah.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.108
( phone ringing )

10:08.208 --> 10:09.509
- Male: Yo.
- Done.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.178
All right.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
Let's get outta here.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.822
Yeah.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.125
Lab tech
to this spot.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.660
Photos and casts.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.462
- 11-39.
- Woman on radio: 11-35.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.264
Can I get 18-12
up here?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.402
Yeah, yeah.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.070
Yeah, yeah.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.806
( chuckling )

10:38.906 --> 10:40.674
You're camped here.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.510
Nobody touches this shit,
nobody even comes near it

10:43.610 --> 10:45.345
until the tech
does his recovery.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.489
Whoa.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.158
Hello.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.893
He stopped running.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.530
Either he
got tired or--

11:03.630 --> 11:06.233
- Or he got into a car.
- Right.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.568
- 11-34.
- Man on radio:
Go ahead, 11-34.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.973
I'm in the 3,000 block
of Lanvale

11:13.073 --> 11:15.142
backing up
to the CSX bed.

11:15.242 --> 11:19.212
I need a lab unit
and a DPW crew
with a jackhammer.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.714
A jackhammer?

11:20.814 --> 11:23.450
Gonna keep
a bit of road, KGA.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.189
Alive.
In the OR.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.691
My people at the scene
have heard this already.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.026
It's a copy
of the original.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.361
Okay, we brought
a machine--

11:35.462 --> 11:36.797
- where the fuck is--
- Sir.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.331
Oh, here it is, here.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.233
Yeah, put it there.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.839
( music playing )

11:52.345 --> 11:54.214
Savino:
Don't fuck with this count.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.582
That's Savino.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.885
I'll be right back
with ya shit.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.920
Greggs:
Where are we?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.288
That sign said Longwood,

12:01.388 --> 12:03.023
but I could swear
this is Warwick.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.324
Orlando:
Hoppers be turning
the sign poles

12:04.424 --> 12:06.159
to fuck with y'all.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.961
Greggs:
I make it we're on
the north side of Warwick,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.396
in an alley,
I don't know, shit,

12:10.998 --> 12:13.366
half a block west
of Longwood, maybe?

12:13.466 --> 12:14.802
I hope y'all
copy that.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.469
This got the right
feel for you?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.071
Orlando:
He better not be long
'cause, see,

12:18.171 --> 12:20.173
I don't know
where the stash is,

12:20.273 --> 12:22.342
and if they draggin'
us all over this part
of town, you know--

12:22.442 --> 12:23.977
Greggs:
What's that?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.712
Oh, Jesus.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.280
- Somethin' ain't right.
- Orlando: What?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.216
- Greggs: Shit ain't right.
- Oh, Christ.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.218
- Man: You snitchin'
motherfucker.
- ( gunshots )

12:31.318 --> 12:34.687
Greggs:
Signal 13, signal 13.
What the fuck?

12:34.788 --> 12:37.925
- She can't reach the gun.
- What the fuck?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.293
Two males, black hoodies,
both of 'em, one is--

12:40.393 --> 12:42.529
( gunshots )

12:42.629 --> 12:44.998
Shut it off.
Shut it off.

13:01.414 --> 13:05.218
P.A. system:
Dr. Mells, line six.
Dr. Mells, line six.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.958
Listen to me,
you fuck.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.993
You did a lot
of shit here.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.895
You played a lot
of fucking cards

13:14.995 --> 13:16.329
and you made a lot
of fucking people

13:16.429 --> 13:18.698
do a lot of fucking things
they didn't want to do.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.167
This is true.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.802
We both know
this is true.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.474
You, McNulty,
are a gaping asshole.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.810
We both know this.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.013
Fuck if everybody in CID
doesn't know it.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.582
But fuck if I'm gonna
stand here and say

13:35.682 --> 13:38.285
you did a single fucking
thing to get a police shot.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.621
You did not do this,
you fucking hear me?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.523
This is not on you.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.158
No, it isn't, asshole.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.128
Believe it or not,
everything isn't about you.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.597
And the motherfucker
saying this,

13:50.697 --> 13:53.033
he hates your guts,
McNulty.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.801
So you know
if it was on you,

13:54.902 --> 13:57.837
I'd be the son of a bitch
to say so.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.411
Shit went bad.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.512
She took two
for the company.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.616
That's the only
lesson here.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.423
Police! Police!

14:16.523 --> 14:19.392
Police,
let me see your hands!
Get on the ground!

14:19.492 --> 14:21.161
Down on the ground!

14:21.261 --> 14:23.296
Search warrant,
get on the ground!

14:23.396 --> 14:25.565
Police, police,
get down, get down!

14:27.734 --> 14:30.170
- He ain't here!
- Who ain't here?

14:30.270 --> 14:32.305
- Zach, he ain't here!
- Zach?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.641
Naw, honey,
we're lookin' for Savino.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.777
Savino?
No, he's my baby.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.280
Yeah, well,
your baby shot a cop.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
Man:
Yo, they kickin'
in the doors,

14:44.017 --> 14:45.318
lookin' for a Savino.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.054
Man 2: What?
What up with that, man?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.122
Man:
Some shit about
he killed a cop.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.458
Man 2: Who, Savino?
Savino ain't shot no cop.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.726
Man:
Man they kickin' in doors,
they actin' like he did it.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.595
- Shit.
- I'm tellin' you, man.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.264
( beeping )

14:57.364 --> 14:58.932
They're talkin'
about it anyway.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.900
Ripples in the pond.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.370
Talkin' ain't
knowin', is it?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.208
Skin this cat
another way.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.678
Two pages to Stringer
tonight, right?

15:11.778 --> 15:14.881
Only this one
after the shooting.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.483
Who's 0-7?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.452
And what phone is he asking
for Stringer to call him back?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.297
- Shit went good,
but there was--
- Hold on.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.965
Radio:
...around 12:30
this morning.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.134
The officer may
have been undercover...

15:36.636 --> 15:38.238
( machine humming )

15:38.338 --> 15:41.474
- All right, so talk.
- Like I said, it went good.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.111
Except there was this bitch
curled up in the back-seat.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.179
- Surprised
the shit out of us.
- Uh-huh.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.248
Didn't even see her
till the shit popped off.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.483
I mean, and if it
was up to me,

15:50.583 --> 15:53.586
I'd let the girl walk.
She didn't look like
the talkin' type.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.322
But Little Man
seen her,

15:55.422 --> 15:57.024
and bugged out,
let a couple go.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.992
Savino didn't tip y'all
off to that bitch?

15:59.092 --> 16:01.261
Wasn't no time for that.
He get up out the car,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.730
we see him go up the block
like we said, right?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.798
After that,
he out of sight

16:05.898 --> 16:07.000
and we bring it home
like we planned, baby.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.402
Well, shorty was a cop.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.707
And she ain't dead.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.012
Where'd y'all
put the guns?

16:21.181 --> 16:22.915
She wasn't no cop, man.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.751
She look like
one of Orlando's ho's.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.186
Bey, where the fuck
are the guns?

16:26.286 --> 16:30.157
A storm drain off
of Park Heights, man.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.092
What the fuck is wrong
with Little Man?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.261
I mean, this motherfucker
bugged out one time.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.962
Well, he gonna
bug out again,

16:36.063 --> 16:37.630
when he find out
shorty's a fuckin' cop?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.466
I mean, c'mon, man.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.035
Savino got a story that
he can keep to and he know it,

16:42.135 --> 16:44.971
but Little Man, he always
been fuckin' weak like that.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.274
Little Man gotta go.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.577
Yo, you hear me?

16:52.945 --> 16:55.148
Yo, this shit
gonna get real heavy.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.317
You understand me, Bey?
We gotta fall back.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.919
I wanna see how it go
with this Savino bullshit,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.954
see how they
go past that.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.623
But if the shit
don't hold,

17:03.723 --> 17:06.925
or if this motherfuckin' cop
wake up and start talkin' shit,

17:07.026 --> 17:09.962
then you gotta go sky up.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.598
Where you got
your peoples at?

17:13.566 --> 17:14.867
New York...

17:14.967 --> 17:17.970
Jersey, Cleveland.

17:18.070 --> 17:21.340
All right, so, um,
Philly, D.C.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.343
You know what I'm sayin'?
No profile,

17:23.443 --> 17:25.678
no connections,
no noise.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.347
You feel me, right?

17:27.446 --> 17:29.048
All right.
We gotta be careful.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.619
( muffled voices )

17:37.390 --> 17:39.359
Jesus.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.965
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
It's alright,
you just scared me.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.737
I, uh...

17:52.172 --> 17:55.575
I work with Kima.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.277
Uh...

17:59.246 --> 18:00.247
Kima, she, uh...

18:00.347 --> 18:03.483
Kima--
Kima's at work.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.188
What?
W-w-what are you--

18:21.268 --> 18:22.902
Dust the receiver,
the coin return,

18:23.002 --> 18:24.471
and the metal top.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.613
The can, too.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.888
P.A. system:
Dr. Jones to the nurses'
station, please.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.990
Dr. Jones to
the nurses' station.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.259
We can't really
know for sure.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.632
Lieutenant?

18:52.732 --> 18:56.269
I'm sitting over there
with Kima's girl and,

18:56.369 --> 18:58.805
I mean, maybe somebody
from the department
or the city,

19:00.006 --> 19:01.341
maybe might want
to say something.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.410
Who's here
from the family?

19:03.510 --> 19:05.678
- A daughter, you say?
- A daughter?

19:05.778 --> 19:08.515
Officer Greggs
has a girl?

19:10.717 --> 19:13.353
A roommate.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.489
The family's in Richmond,
driving up first thing today,

19:16.589 --> 19:19.158
but the roommate's
already here.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.709
I'll do it myself.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.981
No problem.
If we lose her,

19:42.081 --> 19:43.916
he can always pose
for the funeral.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.879
Still need a right door
for Savino.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.949
His last knowns,
his girlfriend, his mama,
all empty holes.

20:50.049 --> 20:53.085
Tracers picked up a couple
hairs on one of the hoodies.
That's something.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.255
So, either these motherfuckers
are a pair of neighborhood yo's

20:56.356 --> 20:59.392
who lucked into $30,000
on a street stickup or...

20:59.492 --> 21:02.795
Or they're pros
who set up in an alley

21:02.895 --> 21:05.164
on one side of the tracks,
then slip over to
the other side

21:05.264 --> 21:07.066
where they park
their ride.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.668
What about the post?

21:08.768 --> 21:12.038
Cause and manner of death
on Mr. Blocker is homicide,

21:12.138 --> 21:13.940
to wit, close-range GSWs
to the shoulder,

21:15.074 --> 21:16.476
chest and left arm.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.445
Nine millimeter,
six left twist,

21:18.545 --> 21:20.279
suitable
for comparison.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.149
We pulled something
different from the back seat
of the car, right?

21:23.249 --> 21:25.184
Yeah, 380,
semi-jacketed.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.519
Casings were
different, too.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.020
So, we confirmed
the two shooters.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.322
Print hit.

21:29.422 --> 21:32.158
Wynton "Little Man" Rice,
enforcer in the 221,

21:32.258 --> 21:34.226
a definite connect
to Barksdale's world.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.063
- A print hit?
- Print hit from what?

21:37.163 --> 21:39.098
Soda can.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.601
Dropped at the pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.003
Still had a little fizz
in it when I got there.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.806
What the fuck is this pay phone
at Park Heights and Belvedere?

21:46.906 --> 21:49.308
It's a phone from which some
motherfucker paged Stringer Bell

21:49.409 --> 21:50.777
20 minutes
after the shooting.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.346
I dusted the phone, too,
but it was smudged.

21:53.446 --> 21:57.617
So, we got a Barksdale pro
in the northwest,

21:57.717 --> 22:00.753
ringing up the boss
minutes after the deed.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.089
So much for
the amateur-hour theory.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.091
Good pull.
You are?

22:05.191 --> 22:07.093
Freamon,
Lester Freamon.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.362
Where you workin'?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.431
Pawn shop unit.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.437
I mean, how you gonna
shoot a police, yo?

22:17.537 --> 22:20.272
Ain't no percentage in that,
you know what I'm sayin'?

22:20.373 --> 22:21.608
For real.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.075
Somebody around here
do that shit,

22:23.175 --> 22:24.977
you know every knocko
in the world be down here,

22:25.077 --> 22:26.379
bustin' heads.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.415
I guess them
Park Heights nigga's

22:28.515 --> 22:30.650
just ain't got
no fuckin' common sense.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.018
A lotta heart,
just no sense.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.987
Hey, yo, Poot.

22:35.087 --> 22:36.022
Wallace on
the phone, yo.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.991
- Yeah?
- Wallace?

22:39.091 --> 22:41.093
Nigga ring me up
twice a day

22:41.193 --> 22:42.529
whether he got shit
to say or not.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.897
Homesick motherfucker
makin' me bug, yo.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.533
Yo, where's he at, yo?

22:46.633 --> 22:49.736
At the shore
with his grandma,
down there...

22:49.836 --> 22:53.773
Probably surfin' or
some bullshit.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.208
Or something.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.646
P.A. system:
Dr. Zellesky, you have
a call on line five.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.782
Dr. Zellesky, you have
a call on line five.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.388
( pager beeping )

23:25.938 --> 23:28.441
( tires screeching )

23:33.145 --> 23:34.581
You just
use that phone?

23:34.681 --> 23:36.282
Yeah, a little
earlier, man.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.484
Y'all might wanna go
to Mosher Street.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.952
- Just now, you used it?
- Yeah.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.256
Man downtown
needs to talk to you.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.592
Man downtown?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.894
Okay, make some sense
for me, please, all right?

23:47.994 --> 23:49.596
I ain't been so clean
in my whole damn life.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.831
- Look, man,
I'm just doin' my job.
- Okay.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.106
What up,
Mr. Beachfront Property?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.174
Wallace:
Naw, fool, I told you,
I'm bayside.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.810
My grandmother
on the bayside.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.479
Still, man, you on vacation
and not bringin' me with you.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.347
How you get all the way
down there, anyhow?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.016
- I took a bus.
- Well, shit.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.884
Tell me how to go
and I grab a 'Hound, too.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.953
Come down there
and hang with your ass.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.355
No, man,
it ain't like that, yo.
The air down here all sticky.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.890
Worse than Baltimore, yo.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.126
And these crickets,
louder than a motherfucker.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.762
Can't get no sleep.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.632
I don't think I'm cut out
to be no country-ass nigga, man.

24:25.732 --> 24:29.368
Operator:
Please deposit $2 for
an additional...

24:29.468 --> 24:31.871
- Shit, I gotta go.
- You can take a nigga
up out the Westside,

24:31.971 --> 24:34.473
- but you can't take--
- ( dial tone )

25:02.468 --> 25:04.203
What's your name?

25:05.805 --> 25:08.040
Look, I didn't
do shit here, okay?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.578
I asked you your name.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.580
Naw, this shit
ain't right.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.548
Who'd you try to page,
shitbird?

25:15.648 --> 25:17.416
Why the fuck
do you care, okay?

25:17.516 --> 25:18.985
I mean...

25:21.387 --> 25:23.422
you have exactly
three more seconds

25:23.522 --> 25:25.792
to explain yourself
to me, asshole.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.564
One shooter definitely
opened the passenger door,

25:31.664 --> 25:33.165
so any latent prints
from that side of the car.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.901
- I didn't do nothing, man!
- ( thumping)

25:35.001 --> 25:38.137
- Why'd you
page her, shitbird?!
- Get off me, man!

25:38.237 --> 25:39.839
- Get off me!
- You think this
is a fucking game?!

25:39.939 --> 25:41.574
I wanna talk
to Detective Greggs.

25:41.674 --> 25:43.810
- You can't, motherfucker.
- Then, McNulty then.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.112
This shit
ain't right, sir!

25:52.819 --> 25:56.255
Savino, Savino.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.190
Mope ain't around.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.965
( dialing, ringing )

26:06.065 --> 26:09.135
Yeah, one of them
low-rise hopper's
on tower phone two.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.970
Okay.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.245
( camera clicking )

26:20.813 --> 26:23.349
Maybe he forgot
the number.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.226
( camera clicking )

26:36.595 --> 26:38.397
What the fuck was that?

26:38.497 --> 26:40.366
You don't know?

26:40.466 --> 26:42.134
We just caught a re-up
off a tower stash.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.672
Fourth floor, south side,
second unit down.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.274
( dialing, ringing )

26:51.210 --> 26:53.012
Daniels:
Put that away.

26:56.749 --> 27:00.419
Put that away
and work the case.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.889
Can I ask you something?

27:11.297 --> 27:14.400
How much of this case would
you give up to get her back?

27:14.500 --> 27:16.703
That's not the point.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.738
Well, how much?

27:19.605 --> 27:21.573
All of it.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.276
But it doesn't
work that way.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.178
You can't give it back.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.019
I'm sitting here with
a hospital progress report

27:33.119 --> 27:35.121
that shows
no fucking progress.

27:35.221 --> 27:38.124
She's not conscious,
she's intubated.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.692
She's had a trach
and a lung collapse,

27:39.792 --> 27:41.360
and if she's got
a shred of luck,

27:41.460 --> 27:44.196
the shot she took
to the neck didn't
catch any spine.

27:44.296 --> 27:48.067
( phone ringing )

27:48.167 --> 27:50.369
It wasn't worth it.

27:53.639 --> 27:56.208
Homicide for McNulty
on line two.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.821
Do your job.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.567
Yeah?

28:21.667 --> 28:23.235
Bunk:
So how you doing
with it?

28:23.335 --> 28:24.971
I'll live.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.638
Yeah?

28:26.739 --> 28:28.507
Well, listen, Jimmy,

28:28.607 --> 28:31.778
we had a little
dust-up over here.

28:31.878 --> 28:36.382
Holley mighta beat one of
your girl's CIs on spec.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.684
What is he,
a short guy?

28:38.785 --> 28:40.219
Mumbles a lot?

28:40.319 --> 28:42.088
Yeah, that's him.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.523
You might wanna roll past
and squelch this shit

28:44.623 --> 28:46.392
before it gets outta hand.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.460
Yeah.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.335
- It ain't worth it, man.
- Naw.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.037
It ain't worth it
at 10 times the price.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.839
A fucking cop, man.
A cop!

28:59.939 --> 29:01.941
How stupid
is this motherfucker?!

29:02.041 --> 29:04.076
If you see a bitch
in the car, change it up.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.045
We can go to Orlando
another fuckin' day.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.014
Savino say
he was tryin' to signal,

29:08.114 --> 29:09.415
but he in the dark,
he don't know
where Bey's at,

29:09.515 --> 29:10.716
or where
they comin' from.

29:10.817 --> 29:11.984
Nothin' breakin'
our way, man, damn.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.719
We gotta
burn this shit.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.955
This is cop money,
it's probably marked somehow.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.424
The guns are in the sewer,
Bey's a rock, so that's cool.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.960
But it's the bitch cop.
If she wake up
and start talkin',

29:21.060 --> 29:22.995
she gonna put Little Man
in there, Bey in there.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.764
- What up with Little Man?
- He's scared.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.633
- He shot a cop.
- Fuck.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.335
But I put Bey on that.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.839
What about Savino?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.173
Well, Savino,
he gotta eat the charge,

29:34.273 --> 29:35.641
but he knew that.

29:35.741 --> 29:38.277
So if he keep
his story tight,
he gonna be all right.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.113
Yeah, we knew Orlando was
a snitchin' motherfucker, man.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.549
Fuck him, but this cash
got us caught up.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.852
I know, man,
that's my fault, man.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.320
Bey and Savino came to me
with the idea that, yo,

29:48.420 --> 29:51.257
if they take Orlando,
they can take the cash, too.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.325
I was like, all right,
y'all get your payday.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.695
Yo, how the fuck is Orlando
gonna front this type of cash?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.597
What it say?

29:58.697 --> 30:00.599
I know, I know.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.068
I fucked up, I know.

30:03.669 --> 30:06.438
A'ight, take this trash
outside, fuckin' burn it.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.109
Tell Wee-Bey to clean up
the mess before he jet.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.851
He was throwin' 911
messages to her pager.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.719
I asked him why,

30:20.819 --> 30:22.588
he raised up.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.957
Shit got outta hand.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.096
- Does he know?
- Uh-uh.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.199
Bubbs:
Hey, McNulty, man.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.934
What they doin'
over there, man?

30:35.034 --> 30:36.602
It's fucked up,
they beatin' on me.

30:36.702 --> 30:40.039
Last night,
she got shot.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.840
Bubbs:
Where the fuck
were you at?

30:41.941 --> 30:44.843
- Where were you?
- I was there.

30:45.878 --> 30:49.015
Hey, Bunk.

30:49.115 --> 30:52.384
We got no good latents
on the passenger side door.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.488
What about the dash?

30:56.588 --> 30:59.625
Call the lab.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.564
So, what can I do?

31:05.664 --> 31:09.668
Well, for one thing you can
roll around the projects,

31:09.768 --> 31:12.571
see who's missing.
Who ain't around.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.141
You okay with that?

31:15.241 --> 31:18.177
Yeah, yeah,
I just, um...

31:18.277 --> 31:21.280
I been keepin' it
kinda close, you know?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.016
Ain't been around
the projects much lately,

31:24.116 --> 31:25.684
you know
what I'm sayin'?

31:25.784 --> 31:28.120
You beefin' with
someone down there?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.022
Naw.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.224
No, I'm not
beefin' with...

31:38.965 --> 31:41.567
Eyes open, Bubbs.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.236
For Kima.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.905
Hang loose,
I'll get you a ride.

31:50.809 --> 31:52.544
Where are we
with Savino?

31:52.644 --> 31:53.812
Still MIA.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.881
Enough of
this bullshit.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.884
Well, if he calls me
for anything,

31:58.985 --> 32:00.686
I'll tell him
to turn himself in.

32:00.786 --> 32:01.887
You know
I'm going to do that.

32:01.988 --> 32:04.323
- Not good enough.
- Excuse me?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.192
We need him now.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.795
No, thanks.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.630
Perhaps as
an officer of the court,

32:11.730 --> 32:13.865
- you could endeavor to--
- Ronnie's being polite.

32:13.966 --> 32:16.002
She's a member of your
twisted little tribe,

32:16.102 --> 32:18.237
so she's putting it into
your twisted little language.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.007
Me? I wouldn't wipe my ass
with a Baltimore lawyer,

32:22.008 --> 32:23.809
no offense.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.811
None taken.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.447
I mean, I'm willing
to let you little ratfuckers
suborn perjury,

32:28.547 --> 32:30.116
and blow smoke up
a judge's ass

32:30.216 --> 32:32.251
and jury-tamper
your balls off

32:32.351 --> 32:34.386
without losing the slightest
bit of my sunny disposition.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.322
And fuck me
if I don't let you

32:36.422 --> 32:38.824
structure your cash
into briefcase fees, either.

32:38.924 --> 32:40.326
That's between you
and the IRS.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.394
And neither one of you
is anybody's friend, right?

32:42.494 --> 32:46.065
I think what Jimmy
is trying to say is--

32:46.165 --> 32:48.800
No, what Jimmy is saying is
if you want me to keep my nose
closed to your shit,

32:48.900 --> 32:51.437
then you're gonna have to
throw me something
when I need it,

32:51.537 --> 32:54.073
and right now
I need Savino Bratton
in bracelets.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.076
I don't know
where he is.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.111
Well, you repped him
the last four felonies.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.547
I'm guessing you can get word
to him if you want to.

33:04.083 --> 33:07.753
A police may die, Maury,
and Savino was there.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.855
He comes in
this afternoon

33:09.955 --> 33:11.823
he takes the drug charge
at least.

33:11.923 --> 33:14.760
Or what?

33:14.860 --> 33:17.563
Or we send tactical
teams into his momma's
house every night,

33:17.663 --> 33:20.632
till there's no house
left to worry about.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.701
And you get a target
letter from the state's
attorney's office,

33:22.801 --> 33:25.404
followed by subpoenas for
every fucking bank account

33:25.504 --> 33:28.307
in your fucking name
and let's see if all
those cash deposits

33:28.407 --> 33:30.142
match the reported income.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.546
I'm hearing this
from him,

33:34.646 --> 33:36.882
and I understand
that he's distraught.

33:36.982 --> 33:39.051
I understand that.

33:39.151 --> 33:42.588
Am I hearing this from
the state's attorney's
office as well?

33:46.658 --> 33:48.427
You are.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.531
I'll see
what I can do.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.402
Fuck you, Jimmy!

33:56.502 --> 33:58.570
You didn't tell me
that was coming.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.038
He'll bring him in.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.973
He will if he can,
that's not the point.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.275
Well, what's the point?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.777
The point is that Maury Levy
is a past officer

34:05.877 --> 34:07.346
of the Monumental
Bar Association,

34:07.446 --> 34:10.549
and unless I want
to spend my whole life
as a fucking ASA,

34:10.649 --> 34:12.951
I can't spend my afternoons
pissing on people who matter.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.221
Another career
in the balance.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.725
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

34:19.824 --> 34:23.094
If only half you
motherfuckers in the state's
attorney's office

34:23.195 --> 34:24.730
didn't want
to be judges,

34:24.830 --> 34:26.831
didn't want to be partners
in some downtown law firm,

34:26.931 --> 34:29.168
if half of you had the fucking
balls to follow through,

34:29.268 --> 34:30.869
you know
what would happen?

34:30.969 --> 34:33.004
A guy like that
would be indicted,
tried and convicted.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.806
And the rest of 'em
would back up enough

34:34.906 --> 34:37.275
so we could push
a clean case or two
through your courthouse.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.312
But no,
everybody stays friends.
Everybody gets paid.

34:40.411 --> 34:43.149
And everybody's got
a fucking future.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.318
You'll just use anyone,
won't you?

34:54.659 --> 34:56.562
So, I've been
searchin' the logs

34:56.661 --> 34:59.398
for pager hits that used
an 0-7 code, right?

34:59.498 --> 35:02.000
It comes up now and then
on D'Angelo's pager.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.270
Stringer's too,
but less often.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.805
Most of the time,
there's nothing
to place the guy,

35:06.905 --> 35:08.807
but check it.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.278
And this is
on Stringer's page?

35:12.378 --> 35:14.880
It comes back to the pay
phone in the emergency room

35:14.980 --> 35:16.215
at Maryland
General Hospital.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.849
Let me guess.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.153
The date of this page
is the same day that
Stinkum got killed.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.555
And Wee-Bey
got shot in the leg.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.091
That was the talk
on the wire, anyway.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.559
You go
to Maryland General

35:27.659 --> 35:29.428
and pull the ER records
for that morning,

35:29.528 --> 35:31.163
you're gonna find
Wee-Bey in the pile.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.733
0-7 is Wee-Bey,
it's gotta be.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.870
And we have Wee-Bey
and Little Man

35:38.970 --> 35:40.339
at the pay phone
at Park Heights

35:40.439 --> 35:42.274
20 minutes
after the ambush

35:42.374 --> 35:44.910
throwing a page
to Stringer.

35:45.010 --> 35:48.580
We're all over town for
this piece-of-shit Savino.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.049
With ties to
the Barksdale organization?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.185
- Yes, sir.
- What else?

35:53.285 --> 35:55.587
Well, the case
is progressing.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.590
We're starting to glean
some possible shooters
from the wiretap.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.559
You know, I asked
for the controlled buy.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.161
I put one of our people
in harm's way.

36:03.262 --> 36:07.199
So right now
I want to make sure that
we are doing everything.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.734
We are, sir.
We're on it.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.837
Good. The commissioner
wants raids citywide.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.205
Every door
we can take.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.640
Any addresses
we can write on.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.243
Anything connected
to a narcotics case.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.945
CID, Tactical,
the DEUs,

36:20.045 --> 36:22.214
and tomorrow
on the 6:00 news,

36:22.314 --> 36:25.817
we put a lot of fucking
dope on the table.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.219
A lot of it!

36:27.319 --> 36:29.421
Dope on the table?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.823
We need to let them
know who we are.

36:31.923 --> 36:35.427
We can't for
one minute let them
think that this will stand.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.866
The commissioner wants
to send a message, Lieutenant.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.369
You make sure you
and your people

36:43.469 --> 36:46.605
do everything possible
to see that it is heard.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.915
Dope on
the damn table.

36:57.015 --> 37:00.118
Hey, it's like
the man said.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.720
We're letting them
know who we are.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.289
Yeah?

37:03.389 --> 37:04.890
And who the hell
are we?

37:11.963 --> 37:13.532
Again, for the record,

37:13.632 --> 37:15.401
let's make clear
that Mr. Bratton

37:15.501 --> 37:17.536
has not been Mirandized
and that what is said

37:17.636 --> 37:19.871
at this juncture is for
purposes of a proffer.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.940
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.142
Okay, then.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.244
Here you go.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.320
That's baking soda.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.689
Which Mr. Bratton intended
to sell to Orlando Blocker.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.291
You can keep it
with our compliments.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.493
Where's the money?

37:41.593 --> 37:43.562
Mr. Bratton did not
receive money.

37:43.662 --> 37:47.198
He left it in the car
when he went to retrieve
the sham cocaine.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.967
If you were recording
the transaction,

37:49.067 --> 37:50.369
the tape will
confirm this.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.571
And he wasn't around
for the shooting either.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.573
In fact, he doesn't know
who the shooters are.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.775
Jay:
And God knows he wasn't
in on the setup.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.110
I mean, it was pure dumb
luck that he left them

37:59.210 --> 38:02.448
in an dead-end alley
and they were shot-to-shit
just two minutes later.

38:02.548 --> 38:05.817
This is bullshit!
A police is down.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.854
Mr. Bratton
had no knowledge

38:08.954 --> 38:11.423
that the young woman
was a police officer.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.692
And no intention
of doing anything

38:13.792 --> 38:17.295
other than defrauding
Mr. Blocker of $30,000.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.866
Ms. Nathan?

38:20.966 --> 38:24.470
No charge if he gives
us the shooters.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.539
And if he testifies,
we'll find a way
to squeeze him

38:27.639 --> 38:29.541
into the federal
witness program.

38:29.641 --> 38:34.012
As I indicated,
Mr. Bratton has no idea
who shot Mr. Blocker

38:34.112 --> 38:36.448
or the undercover officer.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.986
Best you can do
is 286-B.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.889
What the hell
is that?

38:43.989 --> 38:46.892
Distribution of sham CDS,
three year maximum,

38:46.992 --> 38:48.259
$5,000 fine.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.928
That's it?

38:50.028 --> 38:53.098
If he took the cash,
we could go to felony
theft or fraud,

38:53.198 --> 38:56.702
but the tape has him
leaving the money.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.104
Three years.

38:59.204 --> 39:00.906
A cop was shot, Maury.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.409
So if we convict,
he'll do every damn day
of the three.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.010
I can do the three,
ain't no thing.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.013
Bunk:
And the $5,000 fine?

39:09.247 --> 39:11.750
Oh, shit,
you still up 25, right?

39:21.226 --> 39:22.728
Nicely done.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.367
Gimme two, yo.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.933
( radio playing )

40:04.002 --> 40:06.037
Damn, Orlando, yo.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.273
I still can't
believe that shit.

40:08.373 --> 40:11.409
Man, all this shit
behind this motherfucker.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.878
Who the fuck was he?

40:12.978 --> 40:15.647
He ran a club
for my uncle, yo.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.048
Yeah?

40:17.148 --> 40:19.250
Yeah, first Stink,
and now him.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.353
Yeah, man, and I heard
the cop's been all in
Savino's shit, too.

40:22.454 --> 40:25.190
- He ain't been around.
- Little Man, neither.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.926
Somebody could get
to cleanin' up shit
around here.

40:28.026 --> 40:32.263
True. You can't just
be goin' around, droppin'
five-O like that, yo.

40:32.363 --> 40:35.333
You know how your uncle
is when people get to
fuckin' up, man.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.669
He start takin'
that shit personal, man.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.339
Look like a couple more
nigga's gonna get dropped.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.641
- Yo, what up?
- You Dee?

40:42.741 --> 40:44.142
Yeah.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.845
They sayin' you need to get
with Stringer, right away, yo.

40:49.615 --> 40:52.250
See? You movin' up
in the world.

40:52.350 --> 40:55.687
As long as you don't fall in
with the trash they takin' out.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.023
Yeah, whatever, nigga.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.358
I'll be right back.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.761
Tower boys
all nervous and shit.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.296
Little Man
ain't post for work.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.465
Ain't answerin'
his page, neither.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.536
See?

41:10.636 --> 41:12.337
I'm not gonna lie.

41:12.437 --> 41:15.641
She's got swelling
around the vertebrae
from a through-and-through,

41:15.741 --> 41:18.043
and some indications
of partial paralysis.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.512
That might go away
when the swelling goes down.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.147
And it might not either.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.649
Her family
is with her.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.617
What the fuck is up
with homicide?

41:25.717 --> 41:27.519
Are we on
the shooters yet?

41:27.619 --> 41:30.589
They're working it hard.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.691
The departmental response
is gonna be to take doors

41:32.791 --> 41:34.459
tomorrow morning.
Citywide.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.195
Every unit, every district
is kicking in

41:37.295 --> 41:39.330
any drug-connected address
they can write on.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.099
We're gonna
do the same.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.267
Lieutenant, is that--

41:42.367 --> 41:43.669
Except...

41:43.769 --> 41:45.804
we're gonna hold back
on the main stash,

41:45.904 --> 41:48.373
the house up in northwest
we tracked off the wire.

41:48.473 --> 41:51.476
For one thing,
we advance this case more
by sitting on that location.

41:51.577 --> 41:54.012
For another,
raids that are too much
on the bulls-eye

41:54.112 --> 41:55.847
will have Barksdale
changing up.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.684
We might blow
the wire altogether.

41:58.784 --> 42:00.952
We got two addresses
in the low-rises

42:01.052 --> 42:03.755
that are probables,
and another two rowhouses
off the avenue

42:03.855 --> 42:06.191
that have been used for stash
as recently as last week.

42:06.992 --> 42:08.594
But this...

42:08.694 --> 42:11.529
this here is the best bet
for a good rip.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.199
Herc picked up
on it yesterday.

42:15.601 --> 42:17.002
Fourth-floor,

42:17.102 --> 42:19.070
end unit on the south side
of the 221.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.506
They're droppin' the re-ups
out the window

42:21.607 --> 42:22.974
to the hoppers
who run it off.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.509
What if they change up
the apartment?

42:24.610 --> 42:26.144
Well, they do that
every day.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.246
Yesterday was the fifth floor
on the north side.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.916
We're gonna have
a man on the church
watching with a cellphone.

42:31.016 --> 42:33.351
They change up,
we call the duty judge

42:33.451 --> 42:35.754
who orally
amends the warrant.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.889
We hit everything
at 1100 hours.

42:37.989 --> 42:41.727
But the squad
that takes the high-rise
needs to stage at 0500.

42:41.827 --> 42:44.329
We need to be inside before
the building even wakes up.

42:44.429 --> 42:46.865
Anyone who wants
to sleep tonight,

42:46.965 --> 42:49.701
he needs to start typing
his ass off right now.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.472
What's up?

42:54.572 --> 42:57.142
Why ain't
the club open?

42:57.242 --> 42:58.644
You goin' with Bey.

42:58.744 --> 43:02.648
Hey, yo, Bey.

43:02.748 --> 43:05.751
Keep it clean.
Don't make no mistakes.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.495
Goin' where?

43:17.595 --> 43:20.131
What the fuck you
waitin' for?

43:36.514 --> 43:38.950
( muffled talking )

43:45.623 --> 43:48.293
Stop bullshittin' me!

44:04.776 --> 44:06.311
The main stash.
He knows we're on it.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.715
He knows
we held it back.

44:09.815 --> 44:11.883
The deputy.

44:11.983 --> 44:15.086
We grab a senator's
bag man in the projects,
he knows that.

44:15.186 --> 44:17.355
State police come in here
with a cooperator,
he knows that, too.

44:17.455 --> 44:20.291
- It's like
fucking clockwork.
- He's got a rat.

44:20.391 --> 44:22.193
Here, in the detail.

44:27.532 --> 44:29.400
In the beginning,

44:29.500 --> 44:30.969
when we started,
Burrell had me.

44:31.069 --> 44:33.739
I pipelined everything
to that motherfucker.

44:33.839 --> 44:36.441
- But now...
- He lost you.

44:36.541 --> 44:39.310
So now he's picked up
someone else.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.379
That's how they do.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.686
( chattering )

45:04.736 --> 45:07.472
( laughing )

45:09.240 --> 45:11.042
Can we talk?

45:11.142 --> 45:13.478
Excuse me a moment,
gentlemen.

45:16.247 --> 45:18.283
It's Burrell, he's gotta
back off already.

45:18.383 --> 45:19.684
What now?

45:19.785 --> 45:21.352
We're on
a prime location.

45:21.452 --> 45:22.854
Barksdale's stash.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.422
Instead of sitting on it
and making cases off it,

45:24.522 --> 45:26.024
he wants us
to write a paper
and take the door.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.659
- Why?
- Dope on the table.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.061
It's a photo op
to make us all feel better

45:30.161 --> 45:31.763
about Kima Greggs
catching a bullet or two.

45:31.863 --> 45:33.965
Oh, Christ.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.434
You need to rip him
a new one, Your Honor.

45:36.534 --> 45:37.903
Uh...

45:38.003 --> 45:39.938
I don't know, Jimmy.

45:42.673 --> 45:44.943
You back on
the ticket, huh?

45:47.946 --> 45:49.948
It was just
the usual bullshit.

45:52.017 --> 45:54.786
They're just, um,
dickin' me around,

45:54.886 --> 45:56.888
trying to get another
black face on the ticket,

45:56.988 --> 45:59.290
make it four-and-one
to even up for the last time.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.459
The governor had to promise
two new appointments,

46:01.559 --> 46:03.694
so now we're back
where we were.

46:03.795 --> 46:05.530
That's all it was.

46:07.365 --> 46:08.466
That's all?

46:08.566 --> 46:11.202
Half-assed hack
politics, Jimmy.

46:11.302 --> 46:14.339
It has nothing to do
with your case.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.775
I need you on this.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.219
So, who's my daddy now?

46:35.660 --> 46:37.262
( music playing )

46:37.362 --> 46:40.298
I just do what the fuck
they tell me, you know?

46:40.398 --> 46:45.203
It ain't on me to know what
the fuck they have in mind.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.072
Look, Bey.

46:47.172 --> 46:49.407
Now it come down
to this crazy shit.

46:51.109 --> 46:53.478
Yo, turn in this alley
right here.

46:53.578 --> 46:54.812
Right there.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.987
* What's the sound,
out of bound *

47:02.087 --> 47:04.923
* Another nigga down and out,
a crackhead with no name *

47:05.023 --> 47:06.257
* Yo, it's just
an unfriendly game... *

47:06.357 --> 47:08.359
What the fuck
you stoppin' for? Go!

47:08.459 --> 47:11.863
* Cats keep playin', some got
hit hard and wound up payin' *

47:11.963 --> 47:14.299
* Out in the field
but the fans keep payin' *

47:14.399 --> 47:16.968
* Understand what I sayin',
it's just the... *

47:24.442 --> 47:26.377
( dog barking )

47:31.116 --> 47:33.618
Inside, man,
let's go.

47:35.987 --> 47:38.289
This dude is crazy.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.029
- Yo, Bey, man.
- Get in, motherfucker.

47:44.129 --> 47:46.164
We ain't got all night
for this shit.

48:02.113 --> 48:04.249
Man, get in here.

48:14.825 --> 48:16.861
Go ahead, man.

48:16.962 --> 48:18.997
What's wrong with you?

48:31.576 --> 48:33.478
Check it out, Dee.

48:37.248 --> 48:41.186
I need you to feed 'em
while I'm gone.

48:41.286 --> 48:44.956
You gonna give 'em
different food for each tank,
too, all right?

48:47.158 --> 48:49.694
But don't worry,
I'm gonna show you
what to do, c'mere.

48:52.863 --> 48:55.066
These are my tetras.

48:55.166 --> 48:59.137
You got Kimmy,
Alex, Aubrey

48:59.237 --> 49:01.239
and Jezebel
in here somewhere.

49:01.339 --> 49:02.974
I don't know,
she think she cute.

49:03.074 --> 49:05.776
You take two pinches
of whatever food

49:05.876 --> 49:07.545
I got next to
each tank.

49:07.645 --> 49:09.047
They set for the day.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.615
You see,
they ain't no problems.

49:12.350 --> 49:14.152
Just beautiful
as hell, Dee.

49:14.252 --> 49:16.554
I'm gonna go upstairs,
and pack some shit.

49:19.390 --> 49:21.592
Yo, Bey!

49:21.692 --> 49:23.194
Where we goin', man?

49:23.294 --> 49:24.195
Philly.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.863
You gonna take
the truck back,

49:25.963 --> 49:27.498
but first I got to go
upstairs, grab some shit,

49:27.598 --> 49:29.600
show you what to do
with my tanks, right?

49:29.700 --> 49:31.236
Philly, yo?

49:32.503 --> 49:34.505
We shot a knocko, Dee.

49:43.314 --> 49:47.785
* Different I been told

49:47.885 --> 49:51.089
* Shoo-wee

49:51.189 --> 49:57.095
* I want some
sugar in my bowl *

49:57.195 --> 49:58.663
* I want some steam
on my clothes *

50:04.335 --> 50:09.874
* Maybe I can fix things up,
so they'll go *

50:09.974 --> 50:12.977
* What's the matter, Daddy

50:13.078 --> 50:14.011
* Come on, save my soul...

50:14.112 --> 50:18.816
( sobbing )

50:18.916 --> 50:22.253
* I want some sugar
in my bowl *

50:22.353 --> 50:24.089
* I ain't foolin'...

50:24.955 --> 50:27.192
No Savino,
no Little Man,

50:27.292 --> 50:29.060
no Wee-Bey either.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.695
And the Barksdale kid
from the pit

50:32.263 --> 50:34.932
he's out the mix, too.

50:35.032 --> 50:38.002
You think it was
them that did it?

50:38.103 --> 50:40.105
McNulty:
Wee-Bey, Savino,
Little Man.

50:40.205 --> 50:41.939
Yeah, that's what
we're hearing, too.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.842
We got pick-ups
on these motherfuckers

50:44.942 --> 50:46.877
and miles of
NCIC bullshit.

50:46.977 --> 50:48.913
Warrants
for blood and hair, too.

50:49.013 --> 50:51.816
It's Bey and Little Man,
shooter one and shooter two.
I feel it, Bunk.

50:51.916 --> 50:55.086
Yeah, well, right now,

50:55.186 --> 50:56.721
we need our girl
to wake up and say so.

50:58.123 --> 51:00.225
All right.

51:00.325 --> 51:02.693
You did good, Bubbs.

51:02.793 --> 51:03.728
McNulty, you know, um...

51:05.330 --> 51:07.498
the situation
is different for me.

51:07.598 --> 51:10.668
- I mean, for me, I'm--
- Mount up.

51:14.972 --> 51:16.374
I gotta go.

51:16.474 --> 51:19.344
Prez will
get you a ride, okay?

51:34.325 --> 51:36.627
( helicopter hovering )

51:37.795 --> 51:39.497
Move out.

51:40.365 --> 51:42.500
( tires screeching )

52:00.050 --> 52:02.220
Man:
Five-O, five-O!

52:02.320 --> 52:05.156
- Police, police!
- Go, go, go!

52:05.256 --> 52:07.325
Show your hands,
asshole!

52:07.425 --> 52:10.695
- Down on the ground.
- Move it, move it!

52:10.795 --> 52:12.363
McNulty, Freamon,
check the basement.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.699
- Clear?
- All clear.

52:14.799 --> 52:17.302
- Bathroom's clear.
- Check the mattress.

52:17.402 --> 52:19.237
Check under the bed,
check all the drawers,

52:19.337 --> 52:22.273
check every fucking inch
of this room.

52:27.878 --> 52:29.214
- Got anything?
- No.

52:29.314 --> 52:32.417
- Bingo.
- Look at this.

52:35.886 --> 52:36.954
Got it.

52:37.054 --> 52:38.789
There she goes.

52:38.889 --> 52:40.825
Bag it.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.500
Let's do it.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.322
( cameras clicking )

53:27.705 --> 53:29.874
That's fine
police work, Erv.

53:32.810 --> 53:34.312
Ladies and gentlemen,

53:34.412 --> 53:36.647
what you see on the table
in front of you,

53:36.747 --> 53:38.883
represents our department's
answer to a culture

53:39.817 --> 53:41.252
of death and drugs.

53:41.352 --> 53:43.788
And when an officer
falls in this war,

53:43.888 --> 53:46.691
others stand ready
to take up the challenge

53:46.791 --> 53:49.927
and carry the fight
to the very doorstep
of those responsible.

53:50.027 --> 53:53.130
Now this is only the beginning,
I can assure you.

53:53.230 --> 53:57.768
But today,
a message has been sent.

53:57.868 --> 54:01.272
And believe me,
this message is being
heard loud and clear

54:01.372 --> 54:04.275
by all those who seek
profit and power

54:04.375 --> 54:08.045
in the importation
and sale of illegal drugs.

54:08.145 --> 54:09.680
Slow.

54:09.780 --> 54:12.016
Bullshit on
the McCulloh street phone,

54:12.116 --> 54:13.418
nothing on the towers.

54:13.518 --> 54:15.586
Who's on the rooftop?

54:15.686 --> 54:16.787
No one.

54:18.723 --> 54:20.825
Fuck it.

54:20.925 --> 54:22.393
Wallace: Hey, yo,
where the money, man?

54:22.493 --> 54:23.961
Man:
How much you need?

54:24.061 --> 54:25.663
Wallace:
Yo, the bus cost
like 18, man.

54:25.763 --> 54:27.832
Man:
Your grandma
ain't got it?

54:27.932 --> 54:30.435
Wallace:
I ask her, she gonna try
to stop me from bookin'.

54:30.535 --> 54:31.836
I'm tellin' you, boy,

54:31.936 --> 54:33.971
this country-ass shit
got me all messed up.

54:34.071 --> 54:37.107
I'm sayin' you need to send me
something for the bus, yo.

54:37.207 --> 54:38.309
I'm dyin' here,
all broke and shit.

54:38.409 --> 54:39.677
Man:
Yeah, I feel you.

54:39.777 --> 54:41.479
Well, when do you
want to come home?

54:41.579 --> 54:43.448
Wallace:
When the fucking
money get here.

54:43.548 --> 54:45.716
Man:
All right, I'm gonna
probably send it today.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.919
( machines beeping )

55:11.376 --> 55:13.944
( theme music playing )

55:14.305 --> 55:20.931
