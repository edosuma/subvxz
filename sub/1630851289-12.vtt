00:21.597 --> 00:23.914
One Burger of the Day
with fries from France.

00:23.932 --> 00:25.357
That's what I call
French fries sometimes.

00:25.509 --> 00:27.192
-For fun, you know.
-(laughs) Thanks.

00:27.344 --> 00:29.528
So, Valentine's Day
tomorrow, huh, guys?

00:29.755 --> 00:30.937
-Any big plans?
-Oh.

00:31.014 --> 00:33.198
-Uh...
-We have plans,
kind of, sort of.

00:33.350 --> 00:35.942
-We're gonna make dinner.
-Well, heat up leftovers.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.778
Right. Then we'll watch TV

00:37.930 --> 00:39.872
and say I love you, I assume.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.598
-Aw.
-Huh. Okay.

00:41.617 --> 00:42.857
What? It's nice.

00:42.951 --> 00:44.877
Yeesh, guys.
Do they make a Valentine's card

00:45.028 --> 00:46.620
that's also a condolence card?

00:46.772 --> 00:47.954
They do. I've gotten that one.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.215
-Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
-Uh-oh, she's choking.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.958
-Oh, God.
-Where's the choking poster?

00:52.111 --> 00:53.368
Why can't they ever choke
in front of the poster?

00:53.387 --> 00:56.037
-Give her the hymen.
-Gene, no. It-It's Heimlich.

00:56.131 --> 00:58.206
-No, it's not.
-Not choking, not choking.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.784
Just savoring.
This burger's amazing.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.953
From one chef
to another... mwah.

01:03.046 --> 01:04.379
Thanks. You're a chef?

01:04.398 --> 01:07.048
I mean, you did a chef's kiss,
so probably, yes?

01:07.068 --> 01:09.050
Yeah, hi, my name is Rachel.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.794
I have a little place

01:10.887 --> 01:11.904
It's called Tomato Shack.

01:12.131 --> 01:14.055
Tomato Shack? Oh, yeah,
I've heard of it.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.557
-It's-it's kind of a big deal.
-Eh.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.226
Thanks, but I want to talk
about this amazing burger.

01:18.395 --> 01:20.987
Oh, uh, sure,
but how do we do this?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.823
Do I start, or do you?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.157
Oh, my God,
am I messing this up?

01:24.310 --> 01:25.400
Sorry about my dad.

01:25.569 --> 01:27.477
That's the first compliment
he's ever gotten.

01:27.571 --> 01:29.496
Uh, it's not, but I-I can't
think of any others right now.

01:29.648 --> 01:32.907
-I'm Linda.
His muse and his wife.
-His mife.

01:33.001 --> 01:35.094
You guys are a couple?
Mommin' and poppin'?

01:35.245 --> 01:37.412
Ha. Yeah. So, what brings you
to the mainland?

01:37.506 --> 01:40.081
Do Kingshead Island people
call this the mainland?

01:40.101 --> 01:41.767
-We do call it that.
-Yay, Dad.

01:41.918 --> 01:44.161
I was just passing by on my way
to the farmer's market.

01:44.179 --> 01:46.087
Stocking up on ingredients
for tomorrow night.

01:46.165 --> 01:48.515
Right. Valentine's Day
must be big for your restaurant.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.258
Well, we're usually closed
on Mondays,

01:50.277 --> 01:52.352
but I decided to host
a little private seating

01:52.504 --> 01:54.020
for friends and family,
just for fun.

01:54.173 --> 01:56.173
Actually, you know,
if you guys are free...

01:56.266 --> 01:58.024
Oh, they're free.
Sorry to answer for you guys,

01:58.177 --> 02:00.344
but your Valentine's plans
are not plans.

02:00.437 --> 02:03.104
Come on, let me cook for
my new favorite power couple.

02:03.198 --> 02:04.456
-Um...
-Power couple?

02:04.608 --> 02:06.350
Bob, she called us
a power couple.

02:06.368 --> 02:09.536
-Power couple is also
what we call Dad's boobs.
-Gene.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.356
<i> JEN:</i>
<i> I'm excited to be babysitting</i>
<i> you guys tonight.</i>

02:12.374 --> 02:15.025
Also, I'm really enjoying
your house's warm air

02:15.043 --> 02:16.209
and green bean smells.

02:16.362 --> 02:17.952
-Nice, right?
-Definitely.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.455
-Look out, power couple's here.
-Damn, guys.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.457
Yeah, usually at this range
I can see nose hair.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.218
Not tonight. Lot of trimming.
Don't look in the sink.

02:25.371 --> 02:27.312
And did you...
get your bodies straightened?

02:27.481 --> 02:30.649
This is how power couples stand.
Chest out. Kind of hurts.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.042
Yeah, a little bit.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.134
Thanks for coming
so last-minute, Jen.

02:33.228 --> 02:34.969
We would've just had
Tina babysit,

02:34.989 --> 02:36.488
but if the ferry
to Kingshead Island sinks,

02:36.640 --> 02:37.881
we want a sort of adult
in charge

02:37.900 --> 02:39.474
until the kids find new parents.

02:39.568 --> 02:41.809
I don't think I could keep my
eye on the ball tonight anyway.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.054
I'm still riding
my Valentine's Day high.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.405
My shoe came off in gym class,

02:45.557 --> 02:47.666
and Jimmy Junior found it
and gave it back to me.

02:47.817 --> 02:49.075
Cinderella much?

02:49.228 --> 02:50.394
Didn't you say he tried
to throw it away first

02:50.396 --> 02:52.062
'cause he didn't know
whose it was?

02:52.155 --> 02:53.154
Then he saw you hopping around

02:53.248 --> 02:54.915
in one shoe by the pull-up bar?

02:55.067 --> 02:56.491
Mm-hmm. It was like
a fairy tale.

02:56.585 --> 02:59.827
Great, great. Okay, off you go,
you lovebirds.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.254
We'll just be sitting here

03:01.348 --> 03:03.073
like good little children
until you return.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.425
Not planning anything
or taking advantage

03:05.577 --> 03:08.078
of dear, sweet Jen here.
(laughs) Far from it.

03:08.096 --> 03:10.247
-Thank you for that.
-Uh, okay.

03:10.265 --> 03:12.006
Well, we'll be back
around 11:00.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.859
-O' the clock?
-Uh, yeah.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.936
-Just checking.
-Bring me back a doggy bag.

03:16.088 --> 03:17.938
I'm serious.
I want a bag of dogs.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.198
Listen up, I've got a plan.

03:19.349 --> 03:21.182

03:21.202 --> 03:22.943
-What?
-Tina, keep your voice down.

03:27.266 --> 03:28.916

05:09.959 --> 05:11.201
the fortune pieces in a hat

05:11.294 --> 05:14.146
or a large decorative bowl

the drugstore down the street

discounts their Valentine's Day
candy at 8:00.

05:33.892 --> 05:35.149

Jen on board?

05:39.414 --> 05:41.506

to leave the house

about chocolate samplers.

what do you say
we take a stroll?

06:02.104 --> 06:03.753
Get some fresh night air,

06:03.755 --> 06:05.179
maybe pass by the drugstore,

see if they have any
interesting wares for sale.

and my candy sack.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.854

06:12.873 --> 06:14.948
Jen? Honey?
What's gotten into you?

06:15.100 --> 06:18.451
I just think it would be really
fun to sit here for 30 minutes,

06:18.604 --> 06:21.880
and then you all go to your
rooms. How about it, gang?

06:22.107 --> 06:23.123

06:23.366 --> 06:25.366

we don't seem to be heading
for the ferry terminal.

06:43.478 --> 06:46.071
-Sure we are. Littleneck Harbor.
-Littleneck Harbor?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.148
Yeah, you know, the one
most people don't go to

06:48.242 --> 06:49.908

-Uh-oh.

07:30.175 --> 07:32.117
-We're trying to get
to Kingshead Harbor?
-Uh-oh.

07:32.344 --> 07:33.343
Why "uh-oh"?

07:33.361 --> 07:34.786
No more ferries
from here to there.

07:35.013 --> 07:36.604
Just ferries going back
to the mainland.

07:36.623 --> 07:40.016
(groans) O-Okay. Well, we're
supposed to be at Tomato Shack

07:40.109 --> 07:42.202
in, like, now-ish.
Can we call a cab?

07:42.354 --> 07:43.369
A-Are there cabs?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.613
Sure there are cabs.
There are three cabs.

07:45.782 --> 07:46.873
There's three cabs?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.950
Yup. Tom's, Lonnie's,
and Phil's.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.302
Um, can we call one?

07:50.529 --> 07:54.030
Let's see, Tom is married
to Lonnie, so don't call them.

07:54.123 --> 07:55.532
-Why not?
-On Valentine's Day?

07:55.550 --> 07:57.867
You're not the only couple
out for a romantic dinner.

07:57.869 --> 07:59.460
Um, okay. Are you sure
they went out?

07:59.554 --> 08:01.980
I mean, not all couples go
out on Valentine's Day.

08:02.131 --> 08:04.057
Some just like to stay home and,

08:04.151 --> 08:06.318
you know, heat up leftovers.

08:06.545 --> 08:07.468
-Ew.
-Ew?

08:07.562 --> 08:08.561
It's Tom and Lonnie.

08:08.714 --> 08:09.879
They definitely went out.

08:09.973 --> 08:11.305
-Good for them.
-Okay. Wh-- Uh, what about Phil?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.717
-Do you have his number?
-He doesn't drive at night.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.719
He... doesn't drive at night.

08:15.737 --> 08:17.403
I don't know why
I mentioned him.

08:17.556 --> 08:18.980
I just didn't want to leave him
out, you know? It's... Phil.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.332
The guy can't help
his night blindness

08:20.483 --> 08:22.000
and, you know, what happened.

08:22.227 --> 08:23.335
Oh, God, what happened?

08:23.504 --> 08:26.079
Let's just say nobody died,
but one person did.

08:26.155 --> 08:28.173
-Oh, boy.
-But hey, the good news is
you can walk.

08:28.324 --> 08:30.992
It's only two miles that way
and Phil's not on the road,

08:31.011 --> 08:32.677
so you should be safe.

08:32.829 --> 08:34.087
Okay...

08:35.182 --> 08:38.165
What's with Jen?
Sending us to our rooms at 8:00?

08:38.334 --> 08:39.926
To what,
get a good night's sleep?

08:40.078 --> 08:41.853
That choc-blocking monster.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.004
Tina, you should talk to her.

08:43.098 --> 08:44.931
-Why me?
-Because you speak babysitter.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.025
Ken's learning babysitter
on Rosetta Stone.

08:47.176 --> 08:48.693
He loves their culture.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.512
(sighs) Fine.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.106
(humming)

08:53.258 --> 08:55.308
-Uh, hey, Jen.
-Oh! Hi, Tina.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.444
Why aren't you in your room?
Is it on fire?

08:58.539 --> 09:00.187
Um, no, not on fire.

09:00.265 --> 09:03.708
Phew. Fire is not good
for rooms.

09:03.935 --> 09:05.743
-Hey, uh, could you help me?
-Sure.

09:05.896 --> 09:09.381
Adult boys enjoy lips
that are colored in, right?

09:09.608 --> 09:10.957
Uh... yes?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.610
Can you tell me
if I'm doing this correctly?

09:13.628 --> 09:14.794
(humming)

09:14.888 --> 09:17.297
Um, maybe try to stay
on the lips.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.724
You know, you could just use
the mirror in the bathroom.

09:19.876 --> 09:21.059
Wait, you guys have a bathroom?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.395
Okay, listen, Jen,
one babysitter to another.

09:23.546 --> 09:25.897
Is there something going on?
I mean, you got that text,

09:26.049 --> 09:27.791
and then you sent us
to our rooms super early,

09:27.884 --> 09:29.125
and now you're doing your makeup

09:29.144 --> 09:31.477
because you think adult boys
like it... Oh...

09:31.630 --> 09:33.129
Should I also put this
on my eyelids?

09:33.148 --> 09:35.574
No. Also, maybe touch that up?

09:35.725 --> 09:38.410
-Bathroom's down the hall.
-You guys have a hall?

09:38.561 --> 09:40.728
Jen's got an adult boy
coming over.

09:40.822 --> 09:42.155
What? She told you that?

09:42.231 --> 09:43.898
No, but think about it.
The text?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.567
And she was putting on lipstick
just now, or trying to.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.569
Huh. That conniving
little caregiver.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.072
Hey, let's cut her some slack.
It's Valentine's Day.

09:51.149 --> 09:53.741
No way, Tina.
There's candy at stake.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.151
-Yeah. Heard of it?
-Wait.

09:55.170 --> 09:56.928
Having a boy over
while you're babysitting

09:57.080 --> 09:58.746
definitely seems like
it's against the rules.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.248
If Jen's boy comes over soon,
and we catch her,

10:01.268 --> 10:02.342
it's "use it against her

10:02.494 --> 10:04.102
so she takes us
to the drugstore" time.

10:04.253 --> 10:05.678
-But...
-Buh-buh-buh. Tina!

10:05.831 --> 10:08.665
Jen can have her romantic
Valentine's Day blah-de-blah,

10:08.683 --> 10:10.091
whatever you said.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.851
We're just gonna catch her
and blackmail her with it.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.278
It's a win-win.

10:13.429 --> 10:15.947
Is this what the song "I smell
sex and candy" is about?

10:16.174 --> 10:18.024
Ugh. I'm such an idiot.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.692
I should've double-checked
the ferry schedule.

10:19.845 --> 10:22.954
Hey, don't beat yourself up.
I've seen the ferry schedule.

10:23.181 --> 10:25.198
It's crazy looking.
What are we, NASA people?

10:25.350 --> 10:27.108
Plus, we were running.
How were we supposed to know

10:27.127 --> 10:28.868
there was a big obvious sign
we didn't notice?

10:28.962 --> 10:30.870
-(winces)
-You okay? How's your feet?

10:31.022 --> 10:32.355
They're killing me.

10:32.374 --> 10:33.873
I haven't quite broken in
these dress shoes yet.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.375
You've had them 20 years.

10:35.527 --> 10:37.877
Yeah, but I've only worn them,
like, five times. (hisses)

10:38.029 --> 10:39.787
We're almost there, okay? Maybe.

10:39.881 --> 10:42.548
Actually, no, I can still see
the ferry guy looking at us.

10:42.701 --> 10:45.551
-Hi.
-(sighs) Now we're gonna be
an uncool number of minutes late

10:45.704 --> 10:48.980
because I didn't know how to
read a ferry schedule or signs.

10:49.207 --> 10:50.982
Come on, quit being
a ferry pooper.

10:51.134 --> 10:52.651
Hey, look, up ahead.
There's a light.

10:52.802 --> 10:53.968
-Yeah?
-So...

10:53.987 --> 10:55.228
someone's home.
Let's go knock on the door.

10:55.304 --> 10:57.489
-What? No.
-It's the country, Bob.

10:57.716 --> 10:59.549
They can give us a lift.
People probably do that here.

10:59.567 --> 11:02.661
-Come on, I think I see blood
seeping out of your shoe.
-Oh. Oh, God.

11:02.888 --> 11:05.330
"Trespassers will be sheared."

11:05.481 --> 11:07.499
LINDA:
Okay, that's a funny joke,

11:07.668 --> 11:09.150
I think.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.077
Less funny at night,
when you don't know the people,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.338
-and you're about to knock
on their door.
-(sheep baas)

11:13.507 --> 11:15.840
-Oh, you hear that? Sheep.
-Oh, yeah.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.901
See? Just a hilarious
sheep person.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.493
Okay, I'm knocking.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.237
Uh...

11:21.406 --> 11:22.663
-Can I help you?
-Oh, my God!
-(screams)

11:22.741 --> 11:24.574
Uh-oh. Let me guess.
Wrong ferry?

11:24.576 --> 11:27.260
-How'd you know?
-You're dressed pretty nice
for this side of the island.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.095
Yeah, sorry to bother you.

11:29.247 --> 11:31.005
I-I'm Bob, and this is
my wife Linda.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.449
-Hi.
-I'm not sure how to ask this,

11:33.451 --> 11:34.842
so I'm just gonna say it.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.011
Is there any chance you can
give us a ride into town?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.029
Yeah, I could do that.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.680
-Really? Thank you.
-Yay!

11:39.700 --> 11:41.182
But I can't actually
go anywhere until I catch

11:41.201 --> 11:43.034
-Midnight and Moonlight.
-Huh?
-Excuse me?

11:43.111 --> 11:45.094
That's my loose ewe
and her main dude.

11:45.113 --> 11:46.538
They got out of the pasture

11:46.765 --> 11:48.373
and snuck into the hoop house
to steal carrots.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.874
And, since you're here,

11:50.101 --> 11:51.434
if you guys could
help me catch them,

11:51.453 --> 11:53.044
I could get that done quicker
and give you that ride.

11:53.196 --> 11:54.954
Yeah, that sounds easy and fun.

11:55.106 --> 11:56.289
(sighs) Okay. Yeah.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.941
Let's help you catch some sheep.

11:58.034 --> 11:59.217
Great! Right this way.

11:59.444 --> 12:01.052
All you got to do is yell
and scare them

12:01.279 --> 12:03.221
-and send them towards me.
-Uh-huh. Lin,

12:03.448 --> 12:05.056
you know why everything
is going terribly tonight?

12:05.208 --> 12:06.874
It's because
we shouldn't have come here,

12:06.893 --> 12:08.727
to a fancy dinner
with fancy people.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.396
Ah, stuff your fancy down
your pantsy with that talk.

12:11.547 --> 12:12.713
Come on,
let's go get these sheep.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.381
-Ugh.
-Attaboy.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.977
-Hey, sheep!
Go that way. That way.
-Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

12:18.129 --> 12:19.386
-Go away, go away.
-Ugh, I stepped in sheep poop.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.148
Oh, that's just mud.
<i> That</i> was sheep poop.

12:22.225 --> 12:24.033
-(sheep bleating)
-Oh, yeah. (screams)

12:28.139 --> 12:29.230
I'm okay. I just fell down

12:29.249 --> 12:31.065
because a giant fat sheep
knocked me over.

12:31.159 --> 12:32.308
But you know what?
That's what I wanted.

12:32.477 --> 12:34.068
That's how I get inside
their head.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.903
Let's do this. We'll get
that ride to the restaurant,

12:35.981 --> 12:37.146
we'll be back on track.

12:37.165 --> 12:39.257
Sorry about that.
Just keep making noise.

12:39.408 --> 12:41.334
I feel like you're not
fully committing.

12:41.486 --> 12:43.152
Oh, hey there, Russ. Good boy.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.504
Wait, is that a sheepdog?

12:44.598 --> 12:47.156
-Yup, this is Russ.
-Could he help us?

12:47.325 --> 12:49.416
Russ? With the sheep?
No, he's allergic.

12:49.494 --> 12:52.253
-Oh, my God. (screams)
-KELLY: Don't let him
win that one.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.346
Charge him right back.

12:53.498 --> 12:55.089
Oh, I don't want to do that.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.108
Midnight and Moonlight
are a handful, aren't they?

12:57.260 --> 12:59.185
They were overfed
by the previous owner.

12:59.337 --> 13:01.279
We keep them on a diet.
That's why they break out

13:01.430 --> 13:03.448
and sneak into the hoop house
to eat my carrots.

13:03.675 --> 13:06.192
Dieting is hard. Hey.
Do they kind of look like us?

13:06.344 --> 13:08.528
BOB:
Oh, my God.
They do look like us.

13:08.696 --> 13:10.013
Just a little. Shoo! Go!

13:10.031 --> 13:12.439
Wait, Lin. Don't you see?
It makes perfect sense.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.293
-We are Midnight and Moonlight.
-Huh? How?

13:15.520 --> 13:18.855
We wandered away from where
we belong, and we're overfed,

13:18.873 --> 13:20.447
at least I am. Go on! Shoo!

13:20.542 --> 13:22.708
We're not sheep, Bob.
We're a great human couple

13:22.861 --> 13:25.119
who got invited to a neat thing
by someone who likes us,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.712
and we're just having trouble
getting there.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.548
Go that way,
sheep who look like us.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.383
This is no place
for you, you hear me?

13:30.535 --> 13:33.311
-You don't belong here!
-Bobby, calm down.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.814
No, keep it up.
They're heading right for me.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.649
I think you're
making them uncomfortable.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.208
You're making me uncomfortable.

13:39.227 --> 13:40.968
<i> TINA:</i>
<i> I don't love our plan.</i>

13:40.987 --> 13:42.378
I mean, waiting
till Jen's date gets here,

13:42.397 --> 13:44.564
then using their romantic
rendezvousing against her,

13:44.732 --> 13:46.899
it kind of makes me feel
like the opposite of Cupid.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.827
-An evil leprechaun?
-Sort of, yeah.

13:48.978 --> 13:50.236
Tina, this is a sting.

13:50.388 --> 13:51.979
Jen's the one
breaking the rules,

13:52.040 --> 13:53.981
and we're here to bust
their lovey-dovey butts,

13:54.075 --> 13:55.408
so we can break the rules.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.577
If you know a better way
to get to cheap drugstore candy,

13:57.729 --> 13:59.896
we'd love to hear it,
and don't say zip line, because

13:59.914 --> 14:02.248
it seems like it's the solution
to everything, but it's not.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.008
-(front door opens)
-(gasps) Someone's here.

14:04.235 --> 14:05.735
-JEN: How was your Valen-Times?
-That must be him.

14:05.828 --> 14:08.162
TINA:
Briefcase, huh?
This guy means business.

14:08.256 --> 14:10.164
(chuckles) Seriously, though,
looks like a nice fella.

14:10.258 --> 14:11.182
Good for Jen.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.242
Okay, we wait for them
to get cozy,

14:13.261 --> 14:14.744
and then we spring our trap.

14:14.837 --> 14:16.913
A cozy trap,
like beanbag chairs.

14:16.931 --> 14:20.375
Okay, we got them. Hope
those carrots were worth it.

14:20.377 --> 14:22.919
You made these people all muddy
for their nice dinner.

14:22.937 --> 14:25.421
-Oh, my God,
I'm sweating so much.
-Aw!

14:25.514 --> 14:27.273
-(bleating)
-Sheep Bob is winded, too.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.516
I think he's in better shape
than me, possibly.

14:29.685 --> 14:32.186
You see, Bob? Just like that,
we're on our way.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.688
Ah, forgot to mention,
the new seat isn't coming

14:34.708 --> 14:35.932
for another few weeks.

14:35.950 --> 14:37.083
It'll be a little cold in back,

14:37.234 --> 14:38.710
but you can cuddle up with Russ.

14:38.861 --> 14:39.711
BOB:
Okay.

14:39.862 --> 14:41.045
Lin, there's a good amount

14:41.197 --> 14:42.772
of mud and poop back there.

14:42.774 --> 14:43.956
Well, that's what's on us now.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.275
-What's a little more, right?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:46.294 --> 14:48.778
All right, when I say go,

14:48.871 --> 14:50.371
we jump out and bust them.

14:50.465 --> 14:52.873
And throw a giant net over them?
Anybody? No?

14:53.042 --> 14:54.559
Thank you for coming,
Christopher.

14:54.786 --> 14:56.227
On Valen-Times, no less.

14:56.454 --> 14:57.896
Can't believe you were free.

14:58.047 --> 14:59.880
Well, documents need notarizing,

14:59.900 --> 15:01.958
even on holidays of the heart,

15:01.976 --> 15:03.550
and you are one
of my best clients.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.311
I am not. (laughs)

15:05.463 --> 15:07.980
You are. Had to get
a new ink pad 'cause of you.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.074
Huh? What kind of date is this?

15:10.226 --> 15:12.301
-I think Christopher's a notary.
-A what-ary?

15:12.470 --> 15:15.138
It's someone grown-ups hire
to watch them sign things?

15:15.156 --> 15:16.748
I went with Dad
to a notary once.

15:16.899 --> 15:17.974
I thought there
would be notes there.

15:18.109 --> 15:19.642
I was thinking
gossip notes, love notes.

15:19.661 --> 15:22.979
There weren't any notes.
It was a long afternoon.

15:22.997 --> 15:24.071
So, tonight, you're notarizing

15:24.165 --> 15:25.590
your birth certificate
request form?

15:25.817 --> 15:28.818
Okay. Let's crack
the old briefcase. (chuckles)

15:28.836 --> 15:30.929
Yes, please.
Crack the briefcase.

15:31.156 --> 15:32.488
So... jump out now?

15:32.507 --> 15:35.416
(sighs) I don't think
we can bust her for this yet.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.918
TINA:
I mean, the vibe is there,
but there are also papers.

15:38.012 --> 15:39.437
I guess it's
kind of a gray area?

15:39.588 --> 15:42.256
I can't believe
this is how babies are made.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.092
Hey, let's have her
drop us off a block away,

15:45.111 --> 15:46.778
so we can pull
ourselves together

15:46.929 --> 15:48.262
before anyone gets a look at us.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.189
Hey, you're probably right.
What do you think, Russ?

15:50.341 --> 15:51.357
-(snorts)
-Uh-huh.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.009
-Hey, Kelly.
-Yeah?

15:53.102 --> 15:55.954
-Could you drop us off
a block from the restaurant?
-Huh?

15:56.181 --> 15:58.848
Could you drop us off a block
from the restaurant, please?

15:58.866 --> 16:02.126
-What?
-Drop us off a block
from the restaurant--

16:02.353 --> 16:04.203
And... you're pulling up to it
right now. Oh, Great.

16:04.355 --> 16:07.707
-Okay, here we are.
-LINDA: It's fine.

16:07.783 --> 16:08.858
The more we move around,

16:08.876 --> 16:10.193
the more the dirt
just falls off, kind of.

16:10.211 --> 16:11.861
Thanks again for your help
with the sheep.

16:11.954 --> 16:13.972
You guys have a lovely dinner
tonight, all right?

16:14.199 --> 16:16.199
-(grunts)
-Bob, you coming?

16:16.292 --> 16:18.142
I don't know.
Now we have to go in there,

16:18.294 --> 16:21.037
late and covered in poop,
in a nice restaurant,

16:21.055 --> 16:22.221
with non-poop people.

16:22.373 --> 16:25.316
Aw, no, I'm sure
there's some poop people.

16:25.426 --> 16:26.985
Linda, we're out of our league.

16:27.061 --> 16:28.728
Kelly, maybe you could
just drive us

16:28.822 --> 16:30.046
to the ferry terminal, please?

16:30.048 --> 16:31.656
Bobby, no. We came this far.

16:31.849 --> 16:33.140
-We're going in.
-(groans)

16:33.234 --> 16:34.742
-(sneezes, whines)
-Gesundheit.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.406
Bye. Bob, we're here.

16:40.558 --> 16:41.982
We kind of went through
a lot of trouble to get here,

16:42.002 --> 16:43.150
so come on, let's go in.

16:43.244 --> 16:44.910
Mama needs a drink,
and I think you do, too.

16:45.063 --> 16:46.487
Linda, everything
that's happened tonight,

16:46.506 --> 16:49.232
from the sheep poop,
to all the blood in my shoes,

16:49.250 --> 16:50.341
to more sheep poop,

16:50.493 --> 16:52.401
is happening because
we don't belong here.

16:52.403 --> 16:54.570
No. Rachel called us
a power couple.

16:54.589 --> 16:56.239
You don't just throw
words like that around.

16:56.332 --> 16:58.407
We're not a power couple.
Look at us.

16:58.426 --> 17:00.852
We're a...
"need a shower" couple.

17:01.079 --> 17:02.411
Hey, Bob, you remember
my air hockey story?

17:02.430 --> 17:04.580
About how you're really good
at air hockey?

17:04.599 --> 17:05.857
Yeah. You tell it a lot.

17:06.084 --> 17:07.266
-Let me tell it again.
-BOB: Okay.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.101
<i>LINDA: One night I was at a bar,</i>
<i> and I played</i>

17:09.195 --> 17:11.103
<i> for the first time,</i>
<i> and I beat my friend.</i>

17:11.256 --> 17:13.756
<i> Then I beat her again,</i>
<i>and then I beat my other friend,</i>

17:13.758 --> 17:15.441
<i> and then I beat some guy</i>
<i> who was annoyed</i>

17:15.535 --> 17:18.536
<i> that I'd been playing so long,</i>
<i>and then I beat his dumb friend.</i>

17:18.687 --> 17:20.705
<i> The whole bar started</i>
<i> buying me drinks,</i>

17:20.856 --> 17:21.947
calling me "Hockey Queen."

17:22.100 --> 17:23.432
Linda, I know
about "Hockey Queen."

17:23.451 --> 17:25.451
Sometimes, you still
make me call you that.

17:25.603 --> 17:27.361
Hush, just listen.
I couldn't lose.

17:27.455 --> 17:28.695
<i> So, I got show-off-y.</i>

17:28.790 --> 17:30.456
<i> I smacked a shot</i>
<i> against this one guy so hard</i>

17:30.550 --> 17:33.125
<i> the puck bounced back</i>
<i> and hit me in the boob.</i>

17:33.219 --> 17:37.280
<i> (slow-motion):</i>
<i> Ow!</i>

17:37.373 --> 17:39.465
But aren't air hockey pucks
pretty light?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.376
It stung, Bob. Also, you don't
have boobs, so you don't know.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.544
I kind of do.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.288
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Anyway, I got hit in the boob,</i>

17:45.381 --> 17:47.214
<i> and all of a sudden,</i>
<i> I wasn't Hockey Queen anymore.</i>

17:47.308 --> 17:48.974
<i> Everyone was laughing at me</i>
<i> getting hit in the boob,</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:50.459
<i>but I stuck some ice in my bra,</i>

17:50.478 --> 17:52.295
<i> and I went back</i>
<i> and I beat that guy,</i>

17:52.463 --> 17:53.963
<i>and then I beat two more people,</i>

17:53.981 --> 17:56.240
<i> and I went home a winner</i>
<i> with a wet bra.</i>

17:56.467 --> 17:59.077
So, yeah, maybe the universe hit
us in the boob a little tonight,

17:59.228 --> 18:00.561
but we're gonna stay
in the game.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.914
We're gonna go in there
and try to have a good time.

18:03.141 --> 18:05.583
Because you know what?
We deserve it. The end.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.067
Really good story. Very wise.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.236
(sighs) Okay, yeah.
Maybe you're right.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.071
-I am.
-But, before we go in,

18:11.165 --> 18:13.740
do you want me to take
the clumps of what I hope is mud

18:13.835 --> 18:15.593
off your back and your hair?

18:15.744 --> 18:16.743
Yeah. I'll do you, too.

18:16.912 --> 18:19.004
What's going on?
Are we doing this?

18:19.099 --> 18:20.264
I either want to be eating candy

18:20.416 --> 18:22.100
or asleep dreaming
of eating candy.

18:22.176 --> 18:23.917
I still don't know
what I'm looking at here.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.254
I don't know how notaries work.
Tina, is it usually this steamy?

18:27.273 --> 18:30.108
I don't think so? The guy
who notarized Dad's stuff

18:30.335 --> 18:32.335
didn't seem interested
in Dad's whole thing.

18:32.353 --> 18:34.261
Now, I'll need
your thumb print. May I?

18:34.430 --> 18:36.672
Yes. Which one
is the thumb again?

18:36.691 --> 18:38.858
Oh, right, the unusual one.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.101
Perfect thumb.

18:41.195 --> 18:43.346
Yup. This is definitely
a sort of date.

18:43.439 --> 18:46.124
Also, I think it's the
hottest thing I've ever seen?

18:46.351 --> 18:48.517
Okay, so that means
we know all we need to know,

18:48.611 --> 18:51.278
and we go in for the kill,
and Gene get candy soon?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.372
LOUISE:
Ugh. She does look
pretty damn happy,

18:53.524 --> 18:55.691
and her breathing's getting
deep and weird.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.043
-Let's just leave them to it.
-Oh, thank God.

18:58.196 --> 19:00.787
Fine. I guess we could just eat
the Valentine's candy

19:00.882 --> 19:02.381
I have stashed
in my sock drawer,

19:02.475 --> 19:05.143
and under my pillow, and packed
in a balloon in the toilet tank.

19:05.219 --> 19:07.461
Let's sneak back
to our rooms very quietly.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.962
-(farts)
-Gene!

19:09.056 --> 19:10.222
Oops. Sorry.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.966
-What was that?
-I don't know. Maybe I farted?

19:12.986 --> 19:14.134
Oh. Where were we?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.711
-Close one.
-(farts)
-Gene!

19:15.804 --> 19:18.731
I'm sorry. My butt doesn't like
being this sneaky.

19:18.883 --> 19:20.992
Kids? Is that you
out there farting?

19:21.219 --> 19:22.234
Uh, yeah.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.477
Sorry to disturb you.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.054
We know you're doing
important notary stuff.

19:25.223 --> 19:26.980
Right. Just notary stuff.

19:27.149 --> 19:28.666
-That's all this has ever been.
-Uh...

19:28.817 --> 19:31.894
Yes. Hi, young people.
Well, I've rendered my services.

19:31.987 --> 19:34.897
I'll send my invoice. Since
you're a preferred customer,

19:34.990 --> 19:36.916
there's no rush
with the payment. Bye, Jen.

19:37.068 --> 19:39.177
Um, okay. Bye, Christopher.

19:39.253 --> 19:41.828
-Enjoy your Valen-Times.
-You, too.

19:41.923 --> 19:43.014
Wait. Uh, don't leave yet.

19:43.165 --> 19:45.257
Oh, how rude of me.
My business card.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.684
Ooh, card. Give me, give me.

19:46.835 --> 19:50.188
No, it's just-- Ugh, I'm bad
at this Valentine-y crap.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.764
Tina, a little help?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.417
Oh, um, seems like you guys
obviously have a connection

19:54.435 --> 19:56.843
that's more than just
notary to notar...oo?

19:56.938 --> 19:58.921
-Is that-- Is it "notaroo"?
-No.

19:59.014 --> 20:01.924
Sorry. What I'm saying is,
maybe turn off the clock,

20:02.017 --> 20:02.942
and stay and talk.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.702
-Maybe she's right.
-Oh?

20:04.929 --> 20:05.945
Maybe we needed these children,

20:06.113 --> 20:07.205
that I don't think are yours,

20:07.432 --> 20:08.948
but I'm not sure,
to witness our feelings

20:09.116 --> 20:10.616
to make them real to us,

20:10.768 --> 20:13.544
kind of like I would witness
the signing of a boat title

20:13.696 --> 20:14.712
or a mortgage loan.

20:14.863 --> 20:16.121
Ooh, this guy talks the talk.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.199
-Yeah.
-So, yeah, I guess I could stay.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.610
Do you have anything else
that needs notarizing?

20:21.629 --> 20:22.945
-Do I.
-Do you?

20:23.038 --> 20:24.222
-I do.
-My pad is inked.

20:24.373 --> 20:27.283
I mean, it's self-inking,
so it's always ready.

20:27.301 --> 20:29.876
My thumb's ready...
for whatever.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.229
LOUISE:
We should go.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.231
Happy Valentine's Day,
you crazy kids.

20:33.458 --> 20:34.232
Thanks for the card.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.049
Cool if I call
for personal chats?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.902
-Uh, sure.
-Nice, bro.

20:38.053 --> 20:40.905
Yeah, that's not coming off.
Sorry, I tried.

20:41.056 --> 20:44.575
It's okay.
Also, we really smell, right?

20:44.727 --> 20:45.818
Yup. Yup, we do.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.152
-Power couple?
-Power couple.

20:47.305 --> 20:49.638
-Valentine's kiss?
-BOTH: Mwah.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.581
Okay.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.416
-Love you.
-Love you, too.
