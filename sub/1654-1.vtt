WEBVTT

01:36.255 --> 01:38.349
Senor O'Conner, senor O'Conner!

01:43.804 --> 01:45.806
It's okay, you're just in time.

01:45.889 --> 01:47.641
You're going to be a
great father, Brian.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.228
What makes you so sure?

01:50.352 --> 01:52.400
Because I'll be there to
kick your ass if you ain't.

01:53.564 --> 01:54.736
Get in there. Go.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.026
Brian.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.785
Remember, the second you
go through those doors,

02:02.990 --> 02:04.333
everything changes.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.290
Our old life is done.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.253
Let's go for a little ride.

04:45.944 --> 04:47.821
Special Agent Hobbs?
Riley Hicks.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.741
I read your file. Top
of your class at FLETC.

04:50.908 --> 04:52.251
Cairo, Tunis.

04:52.409 --> 04:54.537
Youngest RSO ever
in Afghanistan.

04:54.703 --> 04:57.957
Hell, if you're half as
good as you are on paper,

04:58.123 --> 04:59.841
we're going to get
along just fine.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.926
A Russian military
caravan attacked,

05:02.085 --> 05:04.213
satellite component stolen.

05:04.379 --> 05:06.006
Cars just came out of nowhere.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.175
Six hospitalized, a dozen
vehicles destroyed.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.891
All that in under 90
seconds, in and out.

05:10.969 --> 05:12.016
This is world-class.

05:12.095 --> 05:13.740
Job this good, there's
only one crew in the world

05:13.764 --> 05:14.856
who could get this done.

05:16.558 --> 05:17.919
How the hell did
that get up there?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.239
They caught one.

05:23.398 --> 05:24.490
Where?

05:27.820 --> 05:29.788
I got you five minutes
with this guy.

05:29.947 --> 05:32.416
I only need two.

05:42.668 --> 05:44.841
I want your boss.
Where's Shaw?

05:50.384 --> 05:51.886
I ain't telling you shit.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.350
I was hoping you'd say that.

06:00.811 --> 06:01.937
Is that legal?

06:02.020 --> 06:03.067
No.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.741
But are you going to go
in there and tell him?

06:12.447 --> 06:14.745
I've got rights, you asshole!

06:14.908 --> 06:16.706
Not today.

06:23.542 --> 06:24.634
No, no!

06:34.052 --> 06:35.349
Well, is he talking?
Not anymore.

06:35.470 --> 06:36.551
That room is bugged, Hobbs.

06:36.638 --> 06:39.075
So, any information you just beat
out of him, Interpol has now.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.898
Great. Now they can take the morning off.
Shaw's in London.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.152
Let's go pick him up.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.861
Woman, you just don't pick up
Owen Shaw like he's groceries.

06:46.023 --> 06:48.401
If you want to catch
wolves, you need wolves.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.194
Let's go hunting.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.718
This is what 100 million buys?

07:49.127 --> 07:51.630
It wasn't that hard
to find you, Toretto.

07:53.799 --> 07:55.267
I wasn't hiding.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.940
How's the life of the retired
international criminal?

08:02.307 --> 08:05.481
I like it here. It's quiet.

08:05.978 --> 08:07.230
Nice weather,

08:08.563 --> 08:09.689
and no extradition.

08:11.066 --> 08:13.364
So what are you doing here, cop?

08:13.527 --> 08:15.905
Last Tuesday, a team of
highly coordinated drivers

08:16.071 --> 08:18.540
took down an entire
military convoy in Russia.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.121
I don't do cold weather.

08:20.242 --> 08:21.289
I know it wasn't you.

08:22.244 --> 08:24.405
But you're going to help me
catch the team responsible.

08:25.288 --> 08:27.040
And you ain't gonna need that.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.062
You can't touch him, Hobbs.
You've got no powers...

08:31.086 --> 08:33.259
I'm not here to
extradite anyone.

08:33.422 --> 08:35.095
See, he's going to
come voluntarily.

08:35.256 --> 08:36.850
As a matter of fact,

08:38.342 --> 08:39.595
he's going to beg me.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.563
This was taken a week ago.

08:46.101 --> 08:47.774
I'll see you out front.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.042
It's Letty, isn't it?

09:11.043 --> 09:12.920
It's impossible.

09:16.965 --> 09:21.721
If that was my husband, if there
was a chance, no matter how small,

09:24.097 --> 09:25.474
I would go.

09:43.075 --> 09:46.500
I'm going to need everything,
all the info you got.

09:46.661 --> 09:48.288
You'll get it when
the team gets it.

09:48.455 --> 09:49.798
No team.

09:50.832 --> 09:52.755
This is going to
have to be me alone.

09:52.918 --> 09:54.636
It's not that simple.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.594
The crew we're after, they hit like
thunder and disappear like smoke.

09:57.756 --> 10:00.305
You go in alone, you
won't ever touch them.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.141
I've been chasing this guy across
four continents and 12 countries,

10:03.303 --> 10:05.584
and believe me, the last damn
place I want to be right now

10:05.680 --> 10:08.809
is on your front doorstep,
selling Girl Scout cookies.

10:10.018 --> 10:11.941
I need your help, Dom.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.108
I need your team.

10:20.112 --> 10:21.364
Okay, ladies, bring it in.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.373
Listen, I want to make a toast.

10:23.532 --> 10:24.704
Come on.

10:25.992 --> 10:29.166
Listen, I know a few of y'all
have already been to Macau,

10:29.329 --> 10:30.956
but you have never seen the town

10:31.039 --> 10:32.391
till you've seen it
through my eyes.

10:32.415 --> 10:34.133
We got a penthouse suite

10:34.209 --> 10:36.020
with an ocean view that's
going to change your life.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.763
150-foot yacht with
a helicopter pad...

10:38.922 --> 10:42.426
Mmm-hmm. Safe to say, you're about
to have the time of your lives.

10:42.634 --> 10:44.557
No, you are.

10:44.719 --> 10:46.346
Cheers.

11:34.144 --> 11:35.361
Nice!

11:37.272 --> 11:39.195
I'm a citizen of the world.

11:41.776 --> 11:44.404
Ever thought about
settling down?

11:44.571 --> 11:46.244
Starting a life together?

11:46.698 --> 11:48.325
Aren't we doing that?

11:50.076 --> 11:51.874
Are we?

12:16.853 --> 12:18.105
Hello?

12:19.231 --> 12:20.403
Dom?

12:22.067 --> 12:23.569
I'll be there.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.034
Hey, my man, I need you to
turn this plane around.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.092
All right, listen, ladies. There's
been a little change of plans.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.242
Something came up.

12:31.409 --> 12:33.582
You know that casino I was
telling you all about?

12:33.745 --> 12:35.497
I got some vouchers

12:35.664 --> 12:37.007
to the buffet.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.220
What do you think of this?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.849
He likes it. All right.

12:54.349 --> 12:55.396
Yes.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.601
Or this?

12:57.394 --> 12:58.737
Yes.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.846
That's my boy. All right, let's
see how this thing flies.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.743
Are you watching?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.660
It's Uncle Dom.
What do you know?

13:14.244 --> 13:15.996
Are you waving? What up'?

13:16.162 --> 13:17.755
Hey, Jack.

13:17.914 --> 13:20.258
What's up, Uncle Dom?
What's up, Uncle Dom?

13:20.417 --> 13:22.135
You excited to see him?

13:22.294 --> 13:24.012
Are you already pushing
imports on him?

13:24.170 --> 13:26.138
You say, "Dad's not
pushing anything."

13:26.298 --> 13:27.595
He chose that car.

13:27.757 --> 13:29.304
We know he's an O'Conner, but,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.603
I brought you something, Jack.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.848
Yeah! He's also a Toretto.
I don't know.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.643
Luckily, he has a couple more
years to decide, right'?

13:37.809 --> 13:39.607
I think he decided, Mia.

13:41.146 --> 13:42.819
I think it's time for his nap.

13:42.981 --> 13:44.858
Come on, baby. Okay.

13:46.985 --> 13:48.157
Say bye.

13:48.486 --> 13:49.783
It's weird, huh?

13:51.114 --> 13:52.957
What's weird?

13:54.784 --> 13:56.286
We got everything.

13:56.661 --> 13:59.460
You know, down to the
beer and the barbeque.

13:59.622 --> 14:01.875
But it just...

14:01.958 --> 14:04.632
I don't know, it just
doesn't feel like home.

14:05.503 --> 14:07.631
Maybe it's because, uh,

14:08.423 --> 14:10.318
you don't realize how much
you appreciate something

14:10.342 --> 14:12.310
until somebody takes it away.

14:13.011 --> 14:14.263
I don't know.

14:15.138 --> 14:16.685
The place has probably
changed so much,

14:16.765 --> 14:18.642
you wouldn't even
recognize it anymore.

14:18.808 --> 14:20.025
Yeah.

14:22.354 --> 14:24.356
Everything's changed.

14:25.315 --> 14:27.818
So what's up with you?
What's going on?

14:34.991 --> 14:37.164
Taken a week ago.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.830
Diplomatic Security Service.

14:40.497 --> 14:41.669
Hobbs.

14:47.337 --> 14:50.511
You know, I used to do this
shit all the time as a cop.

14:51.007 --> 14:54.386
This is exactly what cops do.
He's messing with your head.

15:04.312 --> 15:06.235
Letty's dead, Dom.

15:06.398 --> 15:08.492
I need to know for sure.

15:10.527 --> 15:11.870
Then I'm going with you.

15:12.028 --> 15:13.506
You said you were going to
leave this life behind.

15:13.530 --> 15:15.532
We both said that we were
leaving the life behind.

15:16.157 --> 15:17.534
He's right.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.331
We're family.

15:19.828 --> 15:22.502
If we got a problem, we
deal with it together.

15:23.039 --> 15:25.292
And I'll feel safer knowing
you're both out there,

15:25.375 --> 15:27.548
watching each other's backs.

15:27.877 --> 15:31.723
You're stronger together.
You always were.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.226
Now go get Letty.

15:37.679 --> 15:38.726
Bring her home.

15:57.365 --> 15:58.867
Thank God!

15:59.033 --> 16:00.910
Finally, some equipment
I can work with.

16:01.077 --> 16:02.124
What up, boy?

16:02.203 --> 16:04.044
This is way better than
that trash in Rio.

16:05.582 --> 16:07.255
Way better.

16:11.546 --> 16:12.718
You sure about these guys?

16:13.047 --> 16:14.424
Nope.

16:16.050 --> 16:18.018
Has anybody heard
from Leo or Santos?

16:18.178 --> 16:21.853
Last time anyone saw them, they were
hitting up the casinos in Monte Carlo.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.017
I thought that was
our last job, Brian.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.733
And who's paying for all this equipment?
The taxpayers?

16:26.936 --> 16:29.610
So now we work for The Hulk?
That's what we're doing?

16:31.483 --> 16:32.826
Why do I smell baby oil?

16:32.984 --> 16:34.170
If you keep running
your piehole,

16:34.194 --> 16:35.634
you're going to smell
an ass-kicking.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.742
All right, Hobbs,

16:37.238 --> 16:38.581
you got the best
crew in the world

16:38.656 --> 16:39.999
standing right in front of you.

16:41.284 --> 16:43.082
Give them a reason to stay.

16:44.913 --> 16:47.007
Our target is Owen Shaw.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.343
Former major in the
S.A.S., Spec-ops soldier.

16:50.502 --> 16:53.176
He ran the UK's Mobility
Division in Kabul and Basra.

16:53.338 --> 16:56.012
Ah, damn. That Mobility
unit's the truth.

16:56.549 --> 17:00.304
We're talking vehicular warfare.
Best in the world.

17:00.637 --> 17:02.757
Those guys don't mess around.

17:04.015 --> 17:05.856
For years, they've been
running jobs in Europe,

17:05.934 --> 17:07.174
but it's their most recent jobs

17:07.227 --> 17:09.480
that graduated them
to a whole new level.

17:09.646 --> 17:12.115
Three targets, highly specific.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.700
The program terminal
from an ICBM missile...

17:15.359 --> 17:16.987
Got a little change?

17:17.153 --> 17:18.746
Seriously? You're
a millionaire,

17:18.905 --> 17:20.703
and you're still trying
to ask for money?

17:21.449 --> 17:24.749
That's how you stay
a millionaire.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.037
So what does this all mean?

17:26.204 --> 17:27.765
Well, our best guess
is that Shaw's crew

17:27.829 --> 17:29.832
is building a Nightshade device.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.672
Which is? A tech bomb.

17:31.834 --> 17:34.337
Designed to block an entire
military communication grid

17:34.420 --> 17:35.763
for 24 hours.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.595
If you blind a soldier
for a single second

17:37.674 --> 17:39.301
in the middle of a
fight, he dies.

17:39.801 --> 17:42.224
If you blind a country
for 24 hours,

17:42.303 --> 17:43.680
the loss of life is unthinkable.

17:44.973 --> 17:46.784
This could be worth billions
to the right buyer.

17:46.808 --> 17:47.855
Billions?

17:49.018 --> 17:50.645
Why don't we just
steal that shit?

17:50.728 --> 17:51.775
Hey, man.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.441
Which one of these
things is a dollar?

17:55.149 --> 17:56.196
It says something about...

18:01.030 --> 18:02.156
It's on the house.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.834
I want you to help
me catch Shaw.

18:09.664 --> 18:11.382
He's only got one piece
left that he needs,

18:11.541 --> 18:13.384
and I intend to stop
him before he gets it.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.636
Now, I know you
guys are a family.

18:16.879 --> 18:19.302
So I'm offering you
a chance right now

18:19.382 --> 18:21.350
to make that family whole again.

18:28.891 --> 18:30.518
You want to make this
family whole again?

18:32.228 --> 18:34.606
Get us to Letty,
we'll get you Shaw,

18:34.689 --> 18:36.487
full pardons all the way around.

18:40.236 --> 18:41.704
I can't promise you that.

18:41.779 --> 18:43.372
Yes, you can.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.121
That's the deal.

18:51.205 --> 18:52.673
Take it or leave it.

18:58.212 --> 18:59.805
You get me Shaw,

19:01.215 --> 19:02.762
and I'll get your pardons.

19:04.427 --> 19:05.770
You heard him.

19:05.928 --> 19:07.475
But this is different.

19:07.639 --> 19:08.856
We're not dealing with cops,

19:08.931 --> 19:10.331
we're not dealing
with drug dealers.

19:10.933 --> 19:13.482
This is a whole different level.

19:16.064 --> 19:18.533
We're getting paid, right?

19:30.536 --> 19:32.704
Interpol picked up one of
Shaw's guys in Moscow.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.584
I went in, had a little
therapy session with him.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.961
He gave up Shaw's hideout.

19:38.419 --> 19:40.888
Then why aren't we
down there now?

19:41.422 --> 19:42.844
Well, we weren't invited.

19:45.802 --> 19:48.021
Hobbs, they're sending
in your punching bag.

19:48.179 --> 19:52.025
He's wired. He's going to give a
positive ID on Shaw before they move in.

20:05.446 --> 20:08.199
So, the cops just
let you go, huh?

20:09.283 --> 20:12.878
Don't worry, I didn't
give them shit.

20:13.496 --> 20:15.123
Oh, I'm not worried.

20:15.873 --> 20:17.125
Okay.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.426
Turn it over for me.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.770
God, it's amazing.

20:31.389 --> 20:34.359
The simplest things can
'cause the biggest problems.

20:35.601 --> 20:38.980
Good news is, if you
swap out a bad part,

20:40.857 --> 20:43.406
everything runs
smooth as silk again.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.367
Look, Shaw...

20:47.947 --> 20:49.369
Wait, Shaw! Shaw!

20:49.741 --> 20:51.118
Shaw!

20:51.284 --> 20:53.628
I just got confirmation on Shaw.
They're going in.

21:10.219 --> 21:12.392
Wait, wait, hold up...

21:13.556 --> 21:16.436
Police scanners are saying alarms are
going off at Interpol headquarters.

21:16.517 --> 21:17.564
Shit.

21:17.935 --> 21:19.903
He brought us here so he
could take down Interpol.

21:20.271 --> 21:21.397
This whole thing's a set-up.

21:21.564 --> 21:23.532
Brian, take the team.
What about you?

21:23.733 --> 21:25.861
Hobbs and I will wait for Shaw.

21:26.027 --> 21:27.779
Shaw leads to Letty.

21:35.036 --> 21:37.038
Come on, you son of a bitch.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.379
What's this?

21:45.421 --> 21:47.423
It's your share
from the last job.

21:50.051 --> 21:51.678
You're part of the team, Oakes.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.846
You do your job, you get paid.

21:55.056 --> 21:57.275
There's a little extra
in there for you.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.399
Consider it an advance.

22:00.561 --> 22:01.778
For what?

22:02.939 --> 22:04.987
The next job, of course.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.075
Which job?

22:08.319 --> 22:09.992
The one we're working right now.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.706
Han, how far are
we from Interpol?

22:15.868 --> 22:16.994
Twelve blocks away.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.641
You guys, it's a ghost
town over here.

22:18.746 --> 22:20.413
Shaw must have pulled
all the cops to him.

22:20.414 --> 22:23.418
All right, y'all, we're in
this shit, so let's go get it.

22:27.129 --> 22:28.569
It's been fun running
with you, mate.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.889
Stop! Drop the bag!

23:20.182 --> 23:21.434
There he is. On it.

23:25.813 --> 23:27.898
Toretto, it's on you. Straight
ahead, don't lose him.

23:27.899 --> 23:28.991
Ain't gonna happen.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.638
Sorry about that, boys.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.146
Interpol, straight ahead.

24:54.485 --> 24:55.806
Let's go, guys.
We've got company.

25:13.421 --> 25:14.593
Let's go, boys.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.387
Get in! Let's go!

25:28.352 --> 25:30.275
Hey! We got to move. Now!

25:37.903 --> 25:40.747
Shaw, we have three cars tailing us.
You know what to do.

25:52.585 --> 25:53.757
Guys, I got the Rover.

25:54.420 --> 25:55.592
Okay, I got...

25:57.715 --> 25:59.217
Whatever the hell that thing is.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.439
What is that, a hockey puck?

26:45.179 --> 26:46.305
Oh, shit!

27:15.835 --> 27:17.337
Approaching rendezvous point.

27:22.633 --> 27:24.510
Dom! Tej and Roman are out!
Where you at?

27:24.677 --> 27:25.724
I'm right behind you!

27:44.738 --> 27:47.833
Stay on track. I'm
taking the contingency.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.505
Boys, I got eyes on Shaw.
He just made a left.

27:53.664 --> 27:55.758
Toretto, make that left!

29:18.290 --> 29:19.337
Letty.

29:36.684 --> 29:38.027
Take the wheel.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.140
Letty.

30:28.152 --> 30:29.699
This is crazy.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.406
We are not in Brazil.

30:33.824 --> 30:35.997
So, now we got cars
flying in the air?

30:36.160 --> 30:39.255
On some 007-type shit?
This is not what we do!

30:39.538 --> 30:41.757
Man, you really got to
check that emotion.

30:41.915 --> 30:44.714
Your voice just went from
Shaggy to Scooby-Doo.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.504
"This is not what we..."

30:47.880 --> 30:49.928
See, man, when a woman
starts shooting at you,

30:50.090 --> 30:52.889
that's a clear sign
to back the fuck off!

30:54.219 --> 30:56.517
We need to get the
hell out of Dodge!

30:57.639 --> 31:00.392
That could have been
my forehead, man.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.606
No.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.904
That's not as big
as your forehead.

31:10.694 --> 31:11.911
Mia...

31:13.906 --> 31:15.749
Uh, It's definitely Letty.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.036
But it's, uh...
It's complicated.

31:18.202 --> 31:19.920
Letty's alive.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.922
That's all that matters.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.675
We have her back, Brian.

31:26.919 --> 31:31.345
Well, do me a favor and give
Jack a kiss goodnight for me.

31:31.507 --> 31:33.760
Be safe. I love you, Mia.

31:47.689 --> 31:49.817
She definitely saw it was you'?

31:50.609 --> 31:52.657
She looked dead at me, Brian.

31:53.987 --> 31:56.490
Maybe the Letty we once
knew is gone, Dom.

31:58.367 --> 32:01.086
Even though she's alive,
maybe she's gone.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.795
You don't turn your
back on family.

32:06.375 --> 32:09.254
Even when they do.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.441
Ivory. Yo.

32:31.442 --> 32:32.989
It's going to need some repairs.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.950
No problem, treacle.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.031
Are you good?

32:37.656 --> 32:38.908
Yeah.

32:40.534 --> 32:42.127
Okay, listen up.

32:44.705 --> 32:46.082
That was a very different breed

32:46.165 --> 32:48.167
from Hobbs usual
wannabe warriors.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.961
We need to learn who these people
are, what they're made of.

32:51.128 --> 32:52.175
Vegh?

32:55.757 --> 32:57.680
O'Conner, Parker,

32:58.552 --> 33:01.226
Pearce, Toretto

33:01.388 --> 33:03.607
and the rest of the team.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.143
These guys are common criminals.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.312
Tonight these common
criminals were seconds away

33:08.395 --> 33:09.772
from taking us down.

33:09.938 --> 33:13.112
Show them the respect they
deserve, or it weakens us.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.611
You might want to see this.

33:22.159 --> 33:23.957
Ring any bells?

33:31.877 --> 33:32.969
Yeah.

33:35.172 --> 33:36.640
That's the guy I shot.

33:36.715 --> 33:37.762
You look happy.

33:37.966 --> 33:39.263
I don't remember him.

33:39.426 --> 33:40.678
That's bullshit.

33:41.261 --> 33:42.558
We got a problem, guys.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.440
We got a picture of her with the
guy who almost took you out.

33:45.599 --> 33:47.317
Klaus, aren't you team muscle?

33:48.477 --> 33:51.230
Don't make me go over there
and make you team pussy.

33:53.524 --> 33:55.401
She doesn't remember him.

33:56.193 --> 33:58.195
Names and records aren't enough.

33:58.362 --> 34:02.663
I want personal information. Get
into their lives, into their minds.

34:02.824 --> 34:05.668
Find their weaknesses, and
we will exploit them.

34:12.042 --> 34:13.418
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, right.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.346
This is crazy, man.

34:16.505 --> 34:18.007
What are you talking about now?

34:18.172 --> 34:20.801
I'm sitting here looking
at these images...

34:20.967 --> 34:23.516
It's like we're hunting
our evil twins.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.268
Look at this black dude
right here, he's handsome.

34:26.514 --> 34:27.766
Clearly, that's me.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.774
We got a white Hobbs.
This is Han.

34:32.353 --> 34:35.402
Tej, it's an African
in a beanie.

34:35.565 --> 34:37.694
That's like your Mini-Me, man.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.158
And Brian!

34:41.572 --> 34:43.620
When did you do
this photo shoot?

34:44.241 --> 34:45.333
I'm just playing, man.

34:45.576 --> 34:47.873
You know you're the prettiest
blonde around here.

34:56.043 --> 34:58.012
All right, lock it up.
We got two things.

34:58.255 --> 35:01.225
First off, this is the worst damn
city in the world to commit a crime.

35:01.383 --> 35:03.056
They got cameras on
every street corner.

35:03.218 --> 35:05.562
I got video footage
from CCTV of the raid.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.156
Let's track that, see
where it leads us.

35:07.180 --> 35:08.727
And secondly, we just
got confirmation

35:08.807 --> 35:10.447
on what Shaw's crew
grabbed from Interpol.

35:10.517 --> 35:11.638
They ripped off the database

35:11.768 --> 35:14.612
of every location that houses the
final component that they need.

35:14.730 --> 35:15.777
So where are they at?

35:15.856 --> 35:17.697
There are over two dozen
of them around Europe.

35:17.774 --> 35:19.902
But the list is only
good for 96 hours.

35:20.068 --> 35:22.171
Which means, wherever Shaw's
crew is going to hit next,

35:22.195 --> 35:24.038
it's going to happen
within the next four days.

35:24.197 --> 35:25.494
They got a window, and so do we.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.375
Hobbs is right.

35:27.576 --> 35:28.873
So let's break this down.

35:28.952 --> 35:30.152
You met them. What do we know?

35:30.203 --> 35:32.331
We know they have to be
running custom engines.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.225
You heard that flip car
going through those gears.

35:34.249 --> 35:35.466
Sequential transmission.

35:35.542 --> 35:37.062
That didn't sound
like a normal engine.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.762
That was a turbo diesel.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.273
It sounded like something
you hear at Le Mans.

35:40.297 --> 35:41.399
Did you see it take
all those hits

35:41.423 --> 35:42.650
and still stay flat
in the corners?

35:42.674 --> 35:43.846
Yeah, hydraulics.

35:43.925 --> 35:45.097
Or magnetic suspension.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.438
Who not only has access
to the components,

35:47.512 --> 35:49.013
but can fabricate
something like that?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.766
Maybe a handful of
shops in London.

35:50.932 --> 35:53.651
Regular tuner shops aren't
going to cut it on this one.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.653
We're going to have to
dig deeper than that.

35:56.271 --> 35:58.148
Han, Gisele, Roman, you're up.

35:59.149 --> 36:01.197
We find the guy who
made that car,

36:01.652 --> 36:02.744
we find Shaw.

36:04.279 --> 36:05.451
Let's go.

36:05.781 --> 36:07.624
I'll help. Roger that.

36:07.783 --> 36:11.583
Tej, we're gonna need cars without
computer chips that can be overridden.

36:12.412 --> 36:14.665
Make sure they're fast.

36:14.956 --> 36:16.003
I got this.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.802
I'm already on it, Dom.
I've contacted R&D at DSS.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.428
Hobbs...

36:20.712 --> 36:22.339
I said I got this.

36:24.508 --> 36:26.806
This should be interesting.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.696
Man, you really
got to loosen up.

36:41.858 --> 36:43.235
You can't just throw a
bunch of factory-line.

36:43.236 --> 36:44.611
Beemers at people and expect...

36:44.778 --> 36:46.405
Hey. That car is
a hell of a car.

36:46.571 --> 36:48.289
You're talking about
twin-turbo V8,

36:48.365 --> 36:50.413
spitting out 560 ponies, son.

36:50.575 --> 36:53.294
He reads the brochure.
I'm proud.

36:53.453 --> 36:55.376
But with cars, you
have to customize.

36:55.539 --> 36:57.382
It's all between you
and the car you build.

36:57.457 --> 36:59.130
It's a bond, it's a commitment.

36:59.292 --> 37:00.965
It sounds like a marriage.

37:01.128 --> 37:02.880
Yeah, but with cars,
when you trade up,

37:02.963 --> 37:05.261
they don't take half your shit.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.097
Jesus.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.820
With price tags like this, these
cars better be made out of gold.

37:14.099 --> 37:16.898
You ain't thinking about stealing
these cars, are you, Parker?

37:17.144 --> 37:19.818
Kitchen help entrance
is towards the back.

37:20.856 --> 37:21.948
Come again?

37:22.023 --> 37:23.376
I don't mean any
offense, gentlemen,

37:23.400 --> 37:26.153
but you couldn't possibly afford
the cars in this auction.

37:26.319 --> 37:30.495
Substantial lack of gaudy
jewelry, no entourage, no honeys.

37:30.657 --> 37:32.705
Clearly you're not a "baller."

37:32.951 --> 37:33.998
And you.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.088
Hmm. Shoes, shirt, trousers.

37:37.581 --> 37:38.628
Functional.

37:38.707 --> 37:40.755
And your posture, too
rigid, no swagger.

37:40.876 --> 37:43.379
My guess is military. Take
home of 50,000 a year.

37:43.879 --> 37:45.256
That's U.S.

37:45.422 --> 37:46.816
Which is not enough
to be playing here.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.683
So, if you're not kitchen help,

37:48.759 --> 37:50.807
then you must be in
the wrong place.

37:51.636 --> 37:55.061
But please, do finish
your champagne.

37:59.019 --> 38:00.329
Oh, he needs to be
taught a lesson.

38:00.353 --> 38:03.402
Like I said, you ain't
stealing these cars.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.984
I got this.

38:10.322 --> 38:13.917
All right, this is
number five on our list.

38:18.288 --> 38:19.335
Holy shit.

38:19.706 --> 38:22.835
What's the dude plan on hunting?
Moby Dick?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.628
That must be our guy.

38:24.795 --> 38:26.923
So, how do you all
want to play this?

38:27.297 --> 38:28.970
Han and I got this.

38:29.132 --> 38:32.557
We go in tight, you let
me do all the talking,

38:32.719 --> 38:34.016
and you all have my back on it.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.150
He's a man.

38:39.476 --> 38:40.728
Let's go.

38:41.770 --> 38:43.522
"He's a man"?

38:44.439 --> 38:47.363
You know, she always says that.

38:52.864 --> 38:57.870
What you're looking at is a
5.45 by 18 FMJ spitzer bullet.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.006
It's specific to one
handgun, the PSM.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.917
Given that handguns are illegal
in the United Kingdom,

39:04.084 --> 39:06.678
there's very few people that
have access to that firearm.

39:06.837 --> 39:08.384
So if somebody wanted to, say,

39:08.463 --> 39:10.557
track down where it came from,

39:10.715 --> 39:12.888
it wouldn't be too hard.

39:13.844 --> 39:15.924
I was a cop for a lot of years.
Some habits die hard.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.891
A pawn shop.

39:29.150 --> 39:30.276
Who sent you?

39:31.403 --> 39:32.780
Come on, ladies!

39:33.780 --> 39:36.374
Two hot girls like you don't
wander into this neighborhood

39:36.449 --> 39:38.292
unless I've called
the escort service.

39:39.786 --> 39:41.333
And I haven't, yet, today.

39:42.539 --> 39:45.588
I don't know, man. That
was disrespectful.

39:45.792 --> 39:47.385
And I don't like the
way she said it,

39:47.460 --> 39:49.337
like, "He's a man."

39:49.796 --> 39:52.345
"He's a man"? So, what are we?

39:52.507 --> 39:55.010
Come on, she's just
doing her job.

39:55.802 --> 39:57.930
"Doing her job."

39:58.930 --> 40:00.682
I see what's going on.

40:01.474 --> 40:02.726
See what?

40:02.893 --> 40:05.988
You got the little
stardust in your eyes, eh?

40:06.479 --> 40:08.481
Little birds floating
around a little bit.

40:13.069 --> 40:15.492
Uh, you don't want to lease this model.
You want to buy.

40:15.655 --> 40:16.827
Can you please stop talking?

40:16.990 --> 40:20.961
No, no, you're in love!
Look at you!

40:21.036 --> 40:22.413
Just stop.

40:22.787 --> 40:25.085
You got special plans?
Big day?

40:25.165 --> 40:26.486
You're going to
invite us all out?

40:26.833 --> 40:28.593
Better make sure you get
her a big rock, man,

40:28.668 --> 40:31.068
'cause she doesn't look like
she'll be that easily impressed.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.969
And if it's not a big rock,

40:33.048 --> 40:34.275
you better be big
somewhere else.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.552
You know what I'm talking about.

40:37.218 --> 40:40.142
That's why all your girlfriends
wear so much bling, huh?

40:42.766 --> 40:43.966
We're looking for information.

40:44.100 --> 40:46.068
You're looking for information?
About what?

40:46.227 --> 40:49.231
Information about cars.

40:50.023 --> 40:52.367
In particular, two you
designed recently.

40:52.525 --> 40:55.404
Ramp cars. Low slung,
skeletal frames.

40:55.570 --> 40:58.824
We'd be very interested to
find the man who bought those.

40:58.907 --> 40:59.954
Why should I help you?

41:00.033 --> 41:01.376
Because we're asking you nicely.

41:01.451 --> 41:02.873
Because you're asking me nicely?

41:03.036 --> 41:05.789
What can you offer that I can't
get from a thousand other girls?

41:06.122 --> 41:07.874
Hmm?

41:11.044 --> 41:12.091
Stop! Stop!

41:19.886 --> 41:22.059
You look like a man
who likes it rough.

41:22.973 --> 41:26.978
My friend here can give
you heights of pain

41:27.143 --> 41:29.896
you've never experienced before.

41:31.898 --> 41:32.945
Do we have a deal?

41:33.817 --> 41:36.445
Deal! Deal! Deal!

41:36.611 --> 41:37.737
I take it back.

41:39.239 --> 41:40.832
Me likey.

41:54.754 --> 41:55.801
Stop, stop, stop.

41:55.964 --> 41:58.513
So this is how you "got this"?
By buying all of his cars?

41:58.675 --> 42:00.677
What good is having millions
of dollars in the bank

42:00.844 --> 42:02.187
if you don't spend any of it?

42:02.429 --> 42:04.181
But don't worry about that.
Watch this.

42:05.181 --> 42:08.310
Mr. Parker, again, can I
just express our gratitude

42:08.476 --> 42:10.820
and say how much we
appreciate your business.

42:10.979 --> 42:13.607
If there's ever anything else
you need, you just have to ask.

42:13.690 --> 42:14.782
Anything? Mmm-hmm.

42:14.858 --> 42:17.532
Now that you mention it, my
swagger-less friend here,

42:17.694 --> 42:20.322
he really likes that
shirt you have on.

42:20.989 --> 42:22.457
Uh, this shirt?

42:22.782 --> 42:23.874
That shirt.

42:24.034 --> 42:26.878
I'm not entirely sure that this
shirt would fit your friend.

42:26.953 --> 42:28.045
It will fit.

42:28.121 --> 42:29.794
He needs a shirt that's
a little less...

42:29.873 --> 42:30.965
Functional.

42:31.041 --> 42:32.714
That's it, functional.

42:36.129 --> 42:37.346
Okay.

42:42.135 --> 42:43.887
I'll hold that. Thank you.

42:44.137 --> 42:45.684
Come on, man, time is money.

42:45.847 --> 42:46.973
Yes, doing my best.

42:50.060 --> 42:52.859
Damn, you need some hedge
clippers for that shit.

42:53.229 --> 42:56.403
Well, if that will be all...

42:56.649 --> 42:58.572
And the pants, too.

43:05.825 --> 43:06.917
Right.

43:07.660 --> 43:09.879
While you're at it, let
me get that watch.

43:10.038 --> 43:11.255
I like that watch.

43:21.508 --> 43:22.851
This is for you.

43:23.009 --> 43:24.932
And this is for you.
Thank you.

43:25.428 --> 43:27.931
Good day, gentlemen.
Thank you.

43:34.604 --> 43:36.197
So I, um,

43:36.272 --> 43:38.525
I got the information in here.

43:50.203 --> 43:53.457
May I ask why you're
looking for Shaw?

43:54.290 --> 43:56.292
He took something of ours.

43:57.210 --> 43:58.962
We'd like to talk
to him about it.

43:59.129 --> 44:01.223
Let's see what we've got.

44:15.061 --> 44:16.984
All right. What do you want?

44:17.147 --> 44:19.400
They say if someone's
looking for a Russian gun,

44:19.566 --> 44:20.658
you're the man to see.

44:20.775 --> 44:23.153
Oh, they do, do they?

44:27.282 --> 44:28.659
What do you want, mate?

44:36.374 --> 44:38.297
That might be a bad idea.

44:43.047 --> 44:45.596
I'm looking for the owner of this.
I don't know.

44:48.678 --> 44:49.975
Take a closer look.

44:50.138 --> 44:52.186
About a week ago,
a girl came in,

44:52.265 --> 44:53.665
bought guns, ammo,
everything I had.

44:53.808 --> 44:55.481
A girl?

44:55.643 --> 44:56.895
What did she look like?

44:57.061 --> 44:58.404
Tough chick, dark hair.

44:58.980 --> 45:00.072
Mean streak.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.484
Word is she's a street racer.

45:02.609 --> 45:03.656
Where can we find her?

45:03.776 --> 45:05.403
How do I know? Do I
look like a racer?

45:07.488 --> 45:10.458
No. You don't.

45:17.916 --> 45:18.963
Take care, guys.

45:26.424 --> 45:27.516
Oh, shit.

45:43.191 --> 45:44.283
Sorry, girls.

45:49.697 --> 45:50.949
Let's go!

46:40.206 --> 46:41.298
Hold on.

46:41.374 --> 46:44.218
Stay with me. Stay with me.

46:44.377 --> 46:45.720
Tell me where to find Shaw,

46:45.837 --> 46:47.839
and I'll make him pay for this.

46:55.013 --> 46:56.606
Braga...

47:29.213 --> 47:30.556
Ow!

47:48.316 --> 47:49.784
Hey, you!

47:49.942 --> 47:50.989
Stop right there!

49:18.865 --> 49:20.367
You go! No, you go!

50:44.408 --> 50:46.752
No one needs to know about this.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.747
No one.

51:02.885 --> 51:05.138
We lost Ivory.

51:05.304 --> 51:06.897
He's gone.

51:07.557 --> 51:08.604
Thanks.

51:13.813 --> 51:14.905
That's it?

51:15.439 --> 51:18.283
If ivory's dead,
he made a mistake.

51:20.278 --> 51:22.076
If you make a mistake,
you pay the price.

51:26.117 --> 51:27.790
That's a great eulogy, Shaw.

51:28.995 --> 51:30.668
Are you going to
give the same speech

51:30.746 --> 51:32.589
for the rest of us
when we go out?

51:50.933 --> 51:54.437
You're the last one I'd have
pegged to be sentimental.

51:58.941 --> 52:00.659
I like you, Letty.

52:01.819 --> 52:05.289
I dare say I even feel a
certain warmth towards you.

52:05.615 --> 52:06.895
When I found you
in the hospital,

52:06.949 --> 52:09.372
and you couldn't
remember anything,

52:10.494 --> 52:11.666
I said to myself,

52:13.831 --> 52:15.879
"This girl has a gift."

52:17.001 --> 52:19.299
"She's a blank page."

52:20.379 --> 52:24.054
And that made me feel somewhat
protective toward you.

52:25.343 --> 52:28.472
If something happened
to you, for instance,

52:28.638 --> 52:31.892
I think I might find that
slightly harder to bear.

52:34.810 --> 52:36.812
What I'm saying is,

52:37.396 --> 52:40.525
I would hate to see you

52:40.691 --> 52:42.910
make a mistake.

52:50.159 --> 52:52.002
I'm going to get some air.

53:19.897 --> 53:21.899
What the hell happened?
We met Dom's girlfriend.

53:22.441 --> 53:24.364
She's lovely.

53:24.527 --> 53:26.404
Are you all right? Yeah.

53:26.570 --> 53:28.868
Tej, what have you got? Footage, CCTV?
Talk to me.

53:29.031 --> 53:30.533
I just went through all of it.

53:30.700 --> 53:33.453
Believe it or not, everywhere Shaw's
team is, the cameras are down.

53:33.619 --> 53:35.542
That's a hell of a coincidence.

53:36.372 --> 53:39.421
All right, we're going to pay
CCTV a little visit. Let's roll.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.214
What is that?

53:41.377 --> 53:43.755
That is a new toy for you.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.093
So, what happened?

53:45.256 --> 53:47.884
Shaw's goons showed up and
started shooting up the place.

53:48.050 --> 53:49.393
But we got something big.

53:49.552 --> 53:50.974
What? Braga.

53:52.388 --> 53:54.311
He's working with Shaw.

53:55.891 --> 53:56.983
What are you talking about?

53:57.143 --> 53:59.896
It's true. That phone's filled
with coded payment transactions

54:00.062 --> 54:01.905
that lead straight
to Braga's cartel.

54:02.064 --> 54:03.566
Who the hell is Braga?

54:03.733 --> 54:06.577
He ran one of the biggest
cartels in Mexico.

54:06.736 --> 54:08.113
And my old boss.

54:08.779 --> 54:10.577
We used codes just like that

54:10.656 --> 54:11.883
to move money out
of the country.

54:11.907 --> 54:12.999
It all makes sense.

54:13.659 --> 54:15.753
Braga was running Letty, now
he's working with Shaw.

54:15.911 --> 54:17.264
It would explain how
the two of them met.

54:17.288 --> 54:18.557
Okay, so you all know
all this information

54:18.581 --> 54:19.924
about him, where do we find him?

54:19.999 --> 54:21.922
He's sitting in a
prison in Los Angeles.

54:22.001 --> 54:23.344
How do you know that?

54:25.463 --> 54:27.465
Brian put him there.

54:27.631 --> 54:29.568
All right, so this is the
break we were looking for.

54:29.592 --> 54:31.845
If the two of them
were working together,

54:31.927 --> 54:33.429
Braga will know
what Shaw's up to.

54:33.637 --> 54:34.889
I'm going to pay him a visit.

54:34.972 --> 54:36.599
Are you serious right now?

54:36.974 --> 54:39.147
Think about what you're saying.

54:39.435 --> 54:40.937
You're wanted, Brian.

54:41.437 --> 54:44.941
The moment you step foot off
that plane, it's a wrap.

54:45.441 --> 54:46.613
You're not coming back.

54:46.776 --> 54:49.120
"Coming back"? How are you
going to get in the country?

54:49.278 --> 54:51.155
Let me worry about that.

54:58.788 --> 55:00.461
This is on me.

55:01.624 --> 55:03.968
I'm the one that served
her up to Braga.

55:04.794 --> 55:07.798
I'm the one that gets
to make it right.

55:10.382 --> 55:12.225
Let me make it right.

55:14.345 --> 55:15.642
Be careful.

55:23.062 --> 55:24.982
He's ready to see you now.
Right this way.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.823
Thank you for seeing us. I won't
take up much of your time.

55:30.986 --> 55:32.579
My men were attacked
earlier today.

55:32.738 --> 55:34.160
I'm going to need
to see all cameras

55:34.240 --> 55:36.663
in and around Waterloo station.

55:37.201 --> 55:39.374
Will somebody tell
Captain America here

55:39.495 --> 55:41.338
that requires clearance?

55:45.543 --> 55:46.840
Terry.

55:47.586 --> 55:51.181
Bring up cameras 58 through
62, earlier today.

55:54.260 --> 55:56.388
They've been down for
maintenance all morning.

55:57.096 --> 55:58.188
Sorry.

55:58.514 --> 56:01.609
Okay. Well, we appreciate your help.
Thank you.

56:06.230 --> 56:08.153
You know what I find
very interesting

56:08.315 --> 56:11.114
is Interpol was attacked
recently as well.

56:11.277 --> 56:13.496
Those cameras were down, too.
Didn't catch a thing.

56:13.988 --> 56:15.114
Nothing.

56:15.573 --> 56:17.200
Now, that means either
one of two things.

56:17.283 --> 56:18.844
Either means that your
maintenance schedule here

56:18.868 --> 56:20.962
aligns perfectly with
their escape route

56:21.036 --> 56:23.630
or it means that someone
here is working with them.

56:23.998 --> 56:26.592
And that's just ridiculous.

56:26.750 --> 56:27.769
Because there ain't
no way in hell

56:27.793 --> 56:30.171
anybody here would
be working for them.

56:30.462 --> 56:31.823
Particularly you,
ain't that right?

56:32.006 --> 56:34.008
No, no, that's ridiculous.

56:34.174 --> 56:35.642
That is ridiculous.

56:35.801 --> 56:38.600
I'm going to need direct
access to your live feed

56:38.679 --> 56:39.726
citywide.

56:39.847 --> 56:43.147
And I also strongly suggest
that you put a hold on any more

56:43.309 --> 56:44.481
"maintenance."

56:44.643 --> 56:46.486
Yeah, of course.

56:46.812 --> 56:48.985
We appreciate your help.
Thank you so much.

57:07.666 --> 57:10.010
Well, well, well.

57:10.169 --> 57:12.342
The orange in that really
makes your eyes pop.

57:19.345 --> 57:21.063
Thanks, fellas.

57:21.221 --> 57:22.848
Tell me something, O'Conner,

57:23.015 --> 57:24.858
how is it you keep running
around the world,

57:24.934 --> 57:26.184
breaking every law known to man,

57:26.185 --> 57:28.904
and yet here I am, putting
my job on the line for you?

57:29.229 --> 57:32.028
You'll feel a lot better once you get
the credit for taking down Shaw.

57:32.900 --> 57:34.902
Oh, I'm tempted to
settle for you.

57:35.527 --> 57:37.575
Well, you know what
they say, Stasiak,

57:37.738 --> 57:39.364
if you want the
career-changing big fish,

57:39.365 --> 57:41.092
you got to be willing to
put on the big boy panties

57:41.116 --> 57:43.210
and sail out to the deep water.

57:43.369 --> 57:44.871
You're an asshole,
you know that'?

57:49.750 --> 57:52.549
I missed you, too, man.
I really missed you.

57:54.213 --> 57:57.215
I got you admitted into Victor-ville
to do whatever you got to do.

57:57.216 --> 57:58.763
It's a 24-hour hold.

57:58.926 --> 58:00.599
You need to be out of
there by 9:00 A.M.

58:00.761 --> 58:04.106
That's when Forensics will run your
fingerprints through the national database.

58:04.264 --> 58:06.062
That program will match you

58:06.225 --> 58:07.943
and when they find out
who you really are,

58:08.060 --> 58:09.733
I won't be able to
get you back out.

58:10.396 --> 58:11.943
We're talking life in prison.

58:19.571 --> 58:20.743
Cute kid.

58:24.743 --> 58:29.249
So, I found out Braga's being
held in cell block D3.

58:29.415 --> 58:30.462
That's solitary.

58:30.624 --> 58:33.093
I only had enough juice
to get you in Gen Pop.

58:33.460 --> 58:36.760
So you're going to have to do
something to get his attention.

58:37.756 --> 58:38.757
Sorry about this, man.

58:38.841 --> 58:39.933
Sorry about what?

58:50.978 --> 58:52.480
Again?

59:00.654 --> 59:03.123
Big Brother's about to go live.

59:07.661 --> 59:10.665
Damn, you can't flick a booger in
London without somebody noticing.

59:14.460 --> 59:17.134
Hey! Don't touch that. That's
nothing to play with, man.

59:17.296 --> 59:18.343
What's the problem?

59:18.464 --> 59:20.512
That's high-tensile
titanium cable.

59:20.966 --> 59:22.058
What does that mean?

59:22.134 --> 59:24.279
That's what they use to anchor
buildings and hold up Bridges,

59:24.303 --> 59:26.305
stuff you know nothing about!

59:26.472 --> 59:28.975
See, now, their
version, it works cool,

59:29.141 --> 59:32.190
but mine, masterpiece.

59:32.352 --> 59:35.196
See, I reversed the
gears, torqued the motor

59:35.647 --> 59:37.524
and added this tank to the back.

59:38.150 --> 59:39.367
That makes it even sweeter.

59:39.526 --> 59:40.573
It does.

59:40.652 --> 59:41.869
It's not dummy-proof.

59:42.029 --> 59:44.157
Man, I've been known to
handle big guns. Relax.

59:44.490 --> 59:46.490
You've been known to
handle that big-ass head.

59:46.575 --> 59:49.249
Dom, I did some
checking, asked around,

59:49.411 --> 59:51.288
got the location of a
street race tonight.

59:52.623 --> 59:55.172
Four speed Camaro SS big block.

59:56.293 --> 59:57.340
You like it?

59:58.003 --> 59:59.004
Nice color.

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.222
Brian O'Conner.

01:00:50.389 --> 01:00:52.517
That was quite an entrance.

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:00.737
You put a lot of
these men in here.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:04.035
What? You didn't think
one would recognize you?

01:01:06.738 --> 01:01:09.582
I've kept tabs on you, you know.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.544
You've been having a
lot of fun out there.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:16.378
Good cop gone bad,
Rio de Janeiro.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.884
It's exciting when you
go criminal, isn't it?

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:22.091
Too bad you didn't do it earlier,
you could have worked for me.

01:01:22.254 --> 01:01:23.881
Like Letty Ortiz?

01:01:26.091 --> 01:01:28.093
So tell me something,
because I buried her.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.887
Yeah? You did?

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:32.727
You buried something, I couldn't
tell you who or what it was.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.230
I know she's running
with Owen Shaw.

01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:39.563
Still playing cop, huh?

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:42.820
Trust me, this is way
above your pay grade.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:45.952
Humor me, please.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:50.574
Well, you're a dead man
walking, what does it matter'?

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.918
I ran everything for Shaw.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:57.581
Drugs, guns, money, women.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:00.592
He taught me to think global
when I was just local.

01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:02.253
He made me a wealthy man.

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:04.606
And this guy didn't just have
the cartels working for him.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:09.261
He had the CIA, DEA,
everyone in his pocket.

01:02:09.426 --> 01:02:11.599
He knew what was going to
happen before they did.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:16.268
In fact, he even knew when some
wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:19.482
decided to put some
informant in my cartel.

01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:35.327
The minute you put Letty
undercover, she was dead, bro.

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.493
But she survived.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.499
That girl is one tough bitch.

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:20.334
Shaw found her in a
hospital two days later.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.716
He went to finish the job.

01:03:22.874 --> 01:03:24.876
And he didn't kill her. Why?

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:27.671
She had no memory.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:30.348
Perfect girl, huh?

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:34.470
You're lucky this
door's between us.

01:03:40.809 --> 01:03:43.153
What happened to Letty
is on your head.

01:04:28.357 --> 01:04:30.325
Look at me! Look at me.

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:33.491
You won't do it.

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:36.740
What is Shaw up to?

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:39.831
How do you think he knows your
next move before you make it?

01:04:39.993 --> 01:04:41.586
He's got eyes on you.

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:43.338
Think about it.

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:49.965
The only way you
get close to Shaw

01:04:50.128 --> 01:04:51.675
is if he wants you there.

01:06:35.901 --> 01:06:37.903
You've got some
serious balls, man.

01:06:38.236 --> 01:06:39.613
I've been told.

01:06:40.572 --> 01:06:42.495
You know, you're lucky
I missed my shot.

01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:44.660
I think you hit your mark.

01:06:44.826 --> 01:06:46.078
Really?

01:06:46.953 --> 01:06:48.079
What is it with you?

01:06:48.246 --> 01:06:50.089
Do you got a death
wish or something?

01:06:50.248 --> 01:06:51.921
If that's what it takes.

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:53.960
I just want to race.

01:06:55.337 --> 01:06:56.805
You might lose your car.

01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:02.344
Let's do it.

01:07:02.761 --> 01:07:04.604
Your funeral.

01:07:05.263 --> 01:07:07.436
Ride or die, remember?

01:07:16.107 --> 01:07:17.279
Listen up!

01:07:17.984 --> 01:07:20.487
Out here, we're used to
getting what we want.

01:07:20.654 --> 01:07:22.998
This is London, baby.

01:07:23.365 --> 01:07:24.867
But remember,

01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:28.040
don't bite the bait.

01:07:28.203 --> 01:07:29.830
Are you ready'?

01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:32.336
Ready? Ready.

01:07:36.002 --> 01:07:37.345
Steady.

01:07:40.966 --> 01:07:42.013
Go!

01:08:33.685 --> 01:08:35.028
Just like old times.

01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:24.234
This guy is crazy.

01:10:03.983 --> 01:10:05.326
You got to be kidding me.

01:10:35.974 --> 01:10:37.476
You're still
up-shifting early.

01:10:37.642 --> 01:10:40.065
I do that so you brake.

01:10:40.979 --> 01:10:44.074
You lose traction and
the back end kicks out.

01:10:44.983 --> 01:10:45.984
I noticed.

01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:51.494
Look, just because you know how I
ride, doesn't mean you know me.

01:10:52.574 --> 01:10:54.417
You know what they say
where we're from?

01:10:55.744 --> 01:10:58.167
Show me how you drive,
I'll show you who you are.

01:11:00.165 --> 01:11:01.667
V8.

01:11:02.667 --> 01:11:05.170
You never could resist
American muscle.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.683
Nice scar.

01:11:15.847 --> 01:11:19.021
You never could keep yourself
out of trouble, either.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.022
What else do you know about me?

01:11:25.023 --> 01:11:26.525
About you?

01:11:29.027 --> 01:11:30.529
Everything.

01:11:37.368 --> 01:11:39.541
Like this scar.

01:11:39.704 --> 01:11:43.299
You got that the first night we met.
You were 15.

01:11:43.458 --> 01:11:45.711
First street race.

01:11:46.544 --> 01:11:50.469
Some kid trying to show off
lost control of his car,

01:11:50.632 --> 01:11:53.226
wiped out right next to you.

01:11:53.384 --> 01:11:55.728
You're lucky you
didn't lose your arm.

01:11:55.887 --> 01:11:57.309
And let me guess,

01:11:58.056 --> 01:11:59.899
you saved me.

01:12:00.058 --> 01:12:01.560
No.

01:12:02.227 --> 01:12:04.400
I was the kid showing off.

01:12:07.565 --> 01:12:08.908
And here...

01:12:15.406 --> 01:12:17.249
Boyle Heights.

01:12:18.243 --> 01:12:22.339
You were fleeing with my little sister
Mia and got trapped in a corner.

01:12:23.331 --> 01:12:25.754
And you thought it
was a good idea

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:29.592
to ride your Torino Cobra
through a retaining wall.

01:12:32.257 --> 01:12:36.012
All right, how about this one?

01:12:39.597 --> 01:12:42.771
That's the last time
we were together.

01:12:44.269 --> 01:12:46.271
In the Dr.

01:12:47.272 --> 01:12:49.866
You wanted to go
for a night swim.

01:12:51.192 --> 01:12:53.445
You cut yourself on the reef.

01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:55.534
I followed you.

01:12:57.282 --> 01:13:00.126
I even got this scar to match.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:04.793
Look, I don't know
why you're here,

01:13:04.956 --> 01:13:07.800
but I really think
you're over your head.

01:13:16.217 --> 01:13:18.311
I'm here for you.

01:13:22.515 --> 01:13:24.609
That girl you remember,

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:28.109
it's not me.

01:13:29.731 --> 01:13:32.359
Not from what I just saw.

01:13:34.569 --> 01:13:36.242
Like it or not,

01:13:38.406 --> 01:13:40.079
you're still the same girl.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:45.584
I saw it out there.

01:13:47.248 --> 01:13:49.421
I see it right now.

01:13:52.253 --> 01:13:53.300
I got to go.

01:13:55.548 --> 01:13:57.425
Hey.

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:09.483
It belongs to you.

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.682
There she goes,

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.316
leaving you again.

01:14:49.435 --> 01:14:51.278
Bloody fickle, that one.

01:14:52.438 --> 01:14:54.532
You want bloody'?
We could do bloody.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.529
A street kid,

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.329
starts out stealing DVD
players in East L.A.,

01:15:04.993 --> 01:15:08.372
ends up heisting
$100 million in Rio.

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:10.207
Not bad, huh?

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:12.375
It's a good story, isn't it?

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:15.386
Almost inspiring.

01:15:16.713 --> 01:15:19.182
See, what I couldn't fathom is

01:15:19.632 --> 01:15:21.805
why he's not relaxing
on a beach somewhere

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:24.387
with that cute little
Brazilian number.

01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:30.352
Instead, he's working with a two-bit
government hack like Hobbs.

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:34.860
And then I realized,

01:15:37.316 --> 01:15:38.909
he has a weak spot.

01:15:40.653 --> 01:15:43.076
We all got a weak spot.

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:45.158
You know,

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:49.838
when I was young, my brother
always used to say,

01:15:49.996 --> 01:15:52.545
"Every man has
to have a code."

01:15:53.499 --> 01:15:54.751
Mine?

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:56.719
Precision.

01:15:58.046 --> 01:16:01.926
A team is nothing but pieces you
switch out until you get the job done.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.343
It's efficient.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.223
It works.

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:07.559
But you?

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:11.942
You're loyal to a fault.

01:16:12.685 --> 01:16:15.029
Your code is about family.

01:16:16.314 --> 01:16:19.818
And that's great in the holidays,
but it makes you predictable.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:22.445
And in our line of work,
predictable means vulnerable.

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:26.207
And that means I can reach out
and break you whenever I want.

01:16:26.574 --> 01:16:29.418
At least when I go, I'll
know what it's for.

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.296
Well,

01:16:33.372 --> 01:16:35.295
at least you have a code.

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.137
Most men don't.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:44.429
So.

01:16:45.635 --> 01:16:47.433
I'm going to give you a chance.

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:51.065
Take your crew and walk away.

01:16:51.224 --> 01:16:53.818
That's the only way you're going
to keep your family safe.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:59.316
Your brother never told you never
to threaten a man's family?

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.403
It's a pretty
stupid thing to do.

01:17:05.571 --> 01:17:07.994
But I'll make it simple for you.

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:12.329
I walk away when she walks away.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:15.082
Well, then,

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:20.136
it appears this inspiring
tale has come to an end.

01:17:28.177 --> 01:17:29.850
If that's the way it has to go.

01:17:36.936 --> 01:17:38.938
Let me guess...

01:17:40.273 --> 01:17:41.320
Hobbs.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:47.288
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.998
The "two-bit government hack."

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:59.046
See you around, Toretto.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.710
You can bet on it.

01:18:15.474 --> 01:18:18.569
Riley, Shaw's leaving
Batter-sea, heading southeast.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:20.401
Have Tej track him on
his live feed. Go.

01:18:22.023 --> 01:18:23.125
You know what would
have happened

01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:25.777
if I didn't put that
tracker in your car?

01:18:28.154 --> 01:18:29.326
This one?

01:18:36.662 --> 01:18:40.587
You know, this just got me
one step closer to Shaw.

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.926
For what it's worth, Toretto,

01:18:43.336 --> 01:18:46.089
I hope it gets you closer
to what you want, too.

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.947
This better have been worth it.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.408
More than you'll ever know.

01:19:53.281 --> 01:19:54.498
Pretty.

01:19:59.287 --> 01:20:00.459
May I?

01:20:14.385 --> 01:20:17.138
I'm going to ask you
a question, Letty,

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:21.894
and I want you to think very
hard before you answer.

01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:24.859
When I give you the order

01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.443
to take Toretto out,

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:31.448
what will your first thought be?

01:20:33.279 --> 01:20:35.782
Why don't you look me in the eye

01:20:36.907 --> 01:20:40.707
and you tell me what you see.

01:20:49.670 --> 01:20:50.967
Keep it.

01:21:00.848 --> 01:21:02.850
Tej, talk to me,
what have we got?

01:21:03.017 --> 01:21:05.361
We were able to track Shaw
after he left you and Dom,

01:21:05.519 --> 01:21:08.147
but this guy's smart, so we
could only track him so far.

01:21:08.314 --> 01:21:10.692
He seems to know all the
city's blind spots.

01:21:10.858 --> 01:21:12.219
See, we lost him
somewhere in here,

01:21:12.318 --> 01:21:13.568
which means he could be anywhere

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:15.287
within that
half-a-mile radius.

01:21:15.446 --> 01:21:18.370
Maybe if we cross-reference
phone records, leases...

01:21:18.532 --> 01:21:20.580
No, this has got Shaw's
name written all over it.

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:22.871
We've got vantage
points, multiple exits,

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:24.500
subways, highways
and storm drains.

01:21:24.663 --> 01:21:26.165
Bad-ass and brains.

01:21:26.332 --> 01:21:28.452
Woman, you keep that up, I'm
going to be out of a job.

01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:31.303
All right, let's go nail
that son of a bitch.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:56.158
They're long gone.

01:21:56.695 --> 01:21:58.789
There's nothing here.

01:22:06.956 --> 01:22:08.424
There's never nothing.

01:22:16.424 --> 01:22:18.552
There's always something.

01:22:24.849 --> 01:22:26.351
Let's go, guys.

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:32.236
Shaw, everyone is in place. All
things moving according to plan.

01:22:35.443 --> 01:22:37.445
Good. Send him in.

01:22:40.739 --> 01:22:42.707
Yo, it's Hobbs.

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:46.371
What have you got, Parker?
Give me something good.

01:22:46.537 --> 01:22:50.132
Yeah, that paint you got from
Shaw's place is highly specialized.

01:22:50.291 --> 01:22:52.464
Anti-thermal low-IR coating.

01:22:52.626 --> 01:22:54.594
Military. Exactly.

01:22:54.753 --> 01:22:57.427
We got a list of bases around
Europe that use this paint type

01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:58.762
and those specific colors.

01:22:58.924 --> 01:23:00.318
All right, let's
cross-reference that

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:02.140
with all of Shaw's
military targets.

01:23:02.303 --> 01:23:04.601
I guaran-damn-tee you one
of them is gonna match.

01:23:05.973 --> 01:23:09.318
Bingo. It's a NATO
base in Spain.

01:23:09.477 --> 01:23:10.957
That puts Shaw in a
different country.

01:23:11.395 --> 01:23:13.039
That means he's got an
eight-hour lead on us.

01:23:13.063 --> 01:23:15.236
We gotta move now. Tej,
give me that info.

01:23:15.566 --> 01:23:17.878
Riley and I will go ahead and we're
going to lock down the base.

01:23:17.902 --> 01:23:19.996
We're going to protect
that component personally.

01:23:20.154 --> 01:23:22.873
Toretto, I'll arrange transportation
for you and your cars.

01:23:23.032 --> 01:23:26.832
You brush up on your Spanish, boys.
I'll see you en España.

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:52.274
You son of a bitch!
You made it!

01:23:52.811 --> 01:23:54.154
What up, man? Good to see you.

01:23:54.313 --> 01:23:56.691
Good to see you. So,
what's going on here?

01:23:56.857 --> 01:23:58.793
Figured out they're hitting
an army base in Spain.

01:23:58.817 --> 01:24:01.491
Border patrol lD'ed Shaw's men
crossing through last night.

01:24:01.654 --> 01:24:03.748
Hobbs and Riley went
to lock down the base.

01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:05.467
- They're going to meet us there.
- Where's Dom?

01:24:05.491 --> 01:24:07.243
He wasn't going without you.

01:24:13.582 --> 01:24:15.630
I found out what
happened to Letty.

01:24:16.335 --> 01:24:18.383
It's all my fault.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.506
Brian,

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:24.768
whatever you found
out, that's for you.

01:24:25.344 --> 01:24:27.312
What we're about to do now

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:30.607
is for her.

01:24:34.019 --> 01:24:36.067
We've got four teams
on overwatch,

01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:39.029
sniper-spotters in roosts north
and South of the target.

01:24:39.191 --> 01:24:40.693
Just keep all your
men out of sight.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:41.920
When they drive
that truck in here,

01:24:41.944 --> 01:24:44.572
I want to come crashing down on
them like the walls of Jericho.

01:24:44.738 --> 01:24:49.244
Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling
the perimeter security system.

01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:51.629
Your house is compromised.
What are you suggesting?

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:52.834
I ain't suggesting.

01:24:52.913 --> 01:24:55.132
We follow protocol, we
move the component out.

01:24:55.291 --> 01:24:58.293
Shaw thinks it's here. We're going to
get it out of here before he arrives.

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:00.230
Stealth and speed are going
to be our two best friends.

01:25:00.254 --> 01:25:02.566
We're going to protect our little
egg, move it out of the hen-house,

01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:05.844
then we're going to wait for
that goddamn fox to arrive.

01:25:08.929 --> 01:25:11.728
I just got word they caught one
of Shaw's men at the base.

01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:13.016
It's time.

01:25:13.183 --> 01:25:16.813
Something is not right. He
wanted us to find that guy.

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:19.858
Think about it. At Interpol, you
were face-to-face with him.

01:25:20.608 --> 01:25:21.969
Brian, so what are you saying?

01:25:22.359 --> 01:25:27.365
Braga said the only way you get
near Shaw is if he wants you to.

01:25:28.032 --> 01:25:29.830
Tej, where's that component?

01:25:30.242 --> 01:25:31.835
They're moving it to
a secure location.

01:25:36.874 --> 01:25:38.547
Shaw ain't hitting that base.

01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:39.926
He's hitting the convoy.

01:26:15.412 --> 01:26:16.459
Let's go!

01:26:45.192 --> 01:26:47.286
We've got a report, the
convoy's under attack.

01:26:47.361 --> 01:26:48.408
Get a chopper, now!

01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:07.468
Fellas, you better hurry up.
They just took the convoy.

01:27:11.051 --> 01:27:12.394
And Dom,

01:27:12.636 --> 01:27:14.138
Letty's with them.

01:27:14.888 --> 01:27:17.232
We stick to the plan.

01:27:23.897 --> 01:27:25.064
All right, you heard the man.

01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:26.315
Let's play this fast and clean.

01:27:26.316 --> 01:27:27.516
That thing's heading your way.

01:28:05.522 --> 01:28:06.694
All systems go.

01:28:06.857 --> 01:28:08.859
Everything looks stable.

01:28:09.526 --> 01:28:11.699
Uh, guys, we gotta come
up with another plan.

01:28:15.032 --> 01:28:16.033
They got a tank.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.623
I'm sorry, did somebody
just say "a tank"?

01:28:24.875 --> 01:28:26.127
We got company, guys.

01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:28.546
Toretto is coming right at you.

01:28:28.712 --> 01:28:31.340
Okay. Get the weapons hot.

01:28:32.883 --> 01:28:34.885
Give me satellite imaging.

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:30.695
Straight ahead of us.

01:29:31.441 --> 01:29:32.909
There you are.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:49.092
Who's got a plan B?

01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:51.800
Plan B? We need
a plan C, D, E.

01:29:51.962 --> 01:29:53.134
We need more alphabets!

01:29:53.297 --> 01:29:56.426
Hey, we do what we do best.

01:29:56.592 --> 01:29:58.060
We improvise, all right?

01:30:14.318 --> 01:30:17.322
Okay, Jah. Take it
to the other side.

01:30:17.487 --> 01:30:18.830
Let's have some fun.

01:30:34.671 --> 01:30:37.265
What the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't part of the plan.

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:52.026
Take their attention
away from the people!

01:31:05.202 --> 01:31:07.000
Shaw, you don't have to do this.

01:31:18.048 --> 01:31:19.721
We got one right in front of us.

01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:21.142
Boom.

01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:24.058
Oh, shit!

01:31:31.353 --> 01:31:32.730
You lucky bastard.

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:35.482
Roman, you hang in there.

01:31:35.649 --> 01:31:37.242
Hang in there, man!

01:31:40.654 --> 01:31:44.329
Somebody better do something!
I got a tank on my ass!

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.253
There's gotta be a
break up ahead.

01:31:52.749 --> 01:31:53.875
Oh, look,

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:55.923
a bridge.

01:32:26.074 --> 01:32:27.121
Screw it.

01:32:58.273 --> 01:32:59.900
Yeah!

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.163
We're dragging a car behind us.

01:33:06.615 --> 01:33:09.289
Brian, that Mustang would
make a nice anchor.

01:33:09.451 --> 01:33:10.623
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:33:35.852 --> 01:33:36.853
Damn!

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.772
Shaw, we've got to
get rid of that car.

01:33:38.939 --> 01:33:41.488
Letty, go take
care of the cable.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:58.132
Yeah!

01:34:00.877 --> 01:34:02.220
What's she doing?

01:34:02.379 --> 01:34:03.551
Shit!

01:34:04.422 --> 01:34:05.890
Okay, Toretto.

01:34:08.677 --> 01:34:09.724
Here's your girl...

01:34:12.848 --> 01:34:14.441
And your happy ending.

01:34:14.599 --> 01:34:15.771
Letty!

01:34:51.094 --> 01:34:53.597
Jesus Christ.

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:03.156
I can't believe they
stole a 70-ton tank

01:35:03.273 --> 01:35:04.570
for a three-ounce
computer chip.

01:35:04.733 --> 01:35:08.613
That 3-ounce computer chip is more
deadly than 1,000 of those tanks.

01:35:12.157 --> 01:35:13.784
What about her?

01:35:14.284 --> 01:35:15.957
Not her.

01:35:16.119 --> 01:35:17.587
She was working with Shaw.

01:35:17.746 --> 01:35:18.838
Was,

01:35:20.957 --> 01:35:22.959
but she's always been one of us.

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:28.010
Let's give them a minute.

01:35:41.853 --> 01:35:43.821
Let's go process
Shaw and his crew.

01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.154
I've never looked more forward to
filling out paperwork in my life.

01:36:03.875 --> 01:36:05.172
Hey.

01:36:08.505 --> 01:36:11.850
Look, I don't even know
how to say this to you,

01:36:16.554 --> 01:36:18.852
but everything that's happened
here is because of me.

01:36:19.516 --> 01:36:21.016
I'm the one that put
you undercover...

01:36:21.017 --> 01:36:22.690
Stop.

01:36:23.687 --> 01:36:25.360
I may not remember anything,

01:36:26.690 --> 01:36:29.409
but I know one thing
about myself.

01:36:29.693 --> 01:36:32.913
Nobody makes me do
anything I don't want to.

01:36:45.375 --> 01:36:48.504
So, what's our next
adventure after this?

01:36:50.422 --> 01:36:54.097
How about we stay in one place?

01:36:55.051 --> 01:36:56.223
Where are you thinking?

01:36:56.386 --> 01:36:57.888
Tokyo.

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:00.891
We always talk about Tokyo.

01:37:02.225 --> 01:37:04.603
Tokyo it is.

01:37:11.026 --> 01:37:13.745
Can I ask you something?

01:37:21.786 --> 01:37:26.041
How did you know that there would
be a car there to break our fall?

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:28.252
I didn't.

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:35.808
Some things you just
have to take on faith.

01:37:37.469 --> 01:37:38.891
Hey, Toretto!

01:37:54.611 --> 01:37:57.615
You guys really
think you've won.

01:37:58.615 --> 01:38:00.242
This code you live by,

01:38:01.117 --> 01:38:04.291
it's the very reason why you
weren't even in the game.

01:38:06.956 --> 01:38:10.301
I told you exactly what I was gonna
do if you didn't walk away, Toretto.

01:38:11.336 --> 01:38:12.428
Go!

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:14.801
But you didn't listen.

01:38:15.632 --> 01:38:19.853
I told you I can reach out and
break you whenever I want.

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:24.057
And I have.

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.266
Come on.

01:38:28.311 --> 01:38:29.528
Go. No!

01:38:29.687 --> 01:38:31.860
Maybe you should call Mia.

01:38:45.537 --> 01:38:47.039
Mia? Brian!

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.843
Let me go!

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.859
So, this is how
it's gonna go down.

01:39:08.393 --> 01:39:10.361
You're gonna cut me
loose from these cuffs,

01:39:10.812 --> 01:39:12.064
you're gonna hand me the chip,

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:14.398
I'm gonna walk out of here
and you're not gonna follow.

01:39:14.399 --> 01:39:16.572
You must be joking.

01:39:20.572 --> 01:39:21.824
Look at his face.

01:39:25.827 --> 01:39:27.204
Ask him if I'm joking.

01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:32.092
One hostage does not outweigh
the threat to millions.

01:39:33.168 --> 01:39:36.923
I'm sorry, but this
changes nothing.

01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:43.353
It changes everything.

01:39:44.721 --> 01:39:47.440
You tell your men to stand down.

01:39:50.226 --> 01:39:52.069
Stand down.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.402
Toretto,

01:39:56.399 --> 01:39:57.616
I need you to know,

01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:01.371
the moment we let him walk out
that door with that chip,

01:40:01.529 --> 01:40:04.578
words like "amnesty"
and "pardon"

01:40:04.741 --> 01:40:06.414
walk outwith him.

01:40:12.081 --> 01:40:15.927
Those words went out
the day we were born.

01:40:45.281 --> 01:40:46.954
Coming, babe?

01:40:52.455 --> 01:40:53.798
Of course.

01:40:55.625 --> 01:40:57.298
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.803
Like I said,

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.644
you were never in the game.

01:41:07.387 --> 01:41:11.483
If I see you on the horizon, I'll
make the call and the girl's dead.

01:41:24.654 --> 01:41:26.748
So, what about Toretto's sister?

01:41:28.575 --> 01:41:30.327
There's no need for her anymore.

01:41:35.832 --> 01:41:38.756
I just jammed every signal
up and down the spectrum.

01:41:41.004 --> 01:41:42.677
Let's move.

01:41:42.839 --> 01:41:45.183
I'm coming with you.

01:42:18.291 --> 01:42:20.214
Where the hell does this
dude think he's going?

01:42:20.376 --> 01:42:22.219
We're on an army
base, he's trapped.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.973
Wow, you just had
to open your mouth.

01:42:33.264 --> 01:42:35.266
Now we got a big-ass
plane to deal with.

01:42:35.433 --> 01:42:37.606
That ain't a plane.
That's a planet.

01:42:54.577 --> 01:42:58.423
She's as good as dead if Shaw
gets away on that plane.

01:43:02.168 --> 01:43:04.091
Then we don't let him get away.

01:43:11.761 --> 01:43:13.934
Let's end this thing.

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:23.732
Ride or die.

01:43:24.816 --> 01:43:25.908
Ride or die.

01:44:51.527 --> 01:44:52.904
Tell them to take off!

01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:05.045
Babe, get me under the wing.

01:45:05.208 --> 01:45:07.711
If I can hit that flap, we
can keep it from taking off.

01:45:12.715 --> 01:45:13.887
You be careful.

01:45:14.884 --> 01:45:16.727
This is who we are.

01:45:28.898 --> 01:45:29.899
Shit!

01:45:33.569 --> 01:45:34.570
Grab the wheel!

01:46:24.412 --> 01:46:25.459
Dom!

01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:33.762
Go!

01:46:33.963 --> 01:46:35.260
Come on. Let's go.

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.606
Get in the car.

01:48:26.325 --> 01:48:27.326
Whoo!

01:50:03.130 --> 01:50:04.677
What happened? Did
you hit the flap?

01:50:05.299 --> 01:50:06.300
Uh...

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.344
You should buckle up right now.

01:50:08.469 --> 01:50:09.516
What?

01:50:25.361 --> 01:50:26.453
Hey!

01:50:30.533 --> 01:50:31.659
Wrong team, bitch.

01:51:16.412 --> 01:51:17.413
Shit.

01:51:38.475 --> 01:51:39.476
Yeah!

01:51:55.826 --> 01:51:57.169
I got you.

01:53:05.479 --> 01:53:06.571
Tej!

01:53:06.981 --> 01:53:08.073
Keep her steady!

01:53:08.732 --> 01:53:10.655
We gotta move, it's going down!
Go!

01:53:15.364 --> 01:53:17.082
Go, now!

01:53:20.369 --> 01:53:22.337
Come on, let's move, move, move!

01:53:28.585 --> 01:53:29.586
Come on!

01:53:33.674 --> 01:53:35.017
Dom!

01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:41.737
Where's Gisele?

01:56:45.741 --> 01:56:47.584
Where's Gisele?

01:57:16.647 --> 01:57:19.742
So this is worth billions, huh?

01:57:24.279 --> 01:57:25.656
Yes, it is.

01:57:30.452 --> 01:57:31.749
Name your price, Dom.

01:57:36.667 --> 01:57:39.136
1327.

01:58:05.112 --> 01:58:06.864
Don't burn it this time.
Please?

01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:09.374
I never go and burn it, man.

01:58:11.535 --> 01:58:13.128
Good food.

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:17.796
The air quality here is
lousy, the traffic is bad,

01:58:18.542 --> 01:58:20.262
but I think you'll learn
to like this place.

01:58:20.377 --> 01:58:22.880
Yeah, and here you've
got your own garage

01:58:23.005 --> 01:58:24.973
so you can build a
car with Daddy.

01:58:25.048 --> 01:58:26.140
We'll be building a car?

01:58:26.216 --> 01:58:28.719
First car better be
a Charger, Jack.

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:30.972
You mean Skyline.

01:58:32.222 --> 01:58:34.395
Like I said, he's a Toretto.

01:58:34.725 --> 01:58:36.068
You're confusing the kid.

01:58:36.226 --> 01:58:37.537
Mia, you're gonna let
him get away with this?

01:58:37.561 --> 01:58:38.983
You're really going to do it?

01:58:39.813 --> 01:58:40.860
Tokyo.

01:58:42.065 --> 01:58:44.739
Yeah, it's just
something I gotta do.

01:58:44.901 --> 01:58:48.246
You know we got your back,
whenever you need us.

01:58:52.326 --> 01:58:54.749
Hey, Mia, you better
hide your baby oil.

01:58:54.828 --> 01:58:55.829
I'm just playing.

01:58:55.912 --> 01:58:57.585
You better hide that
big-ass forehead.

01:58:57.748 --> 01:58:59.028
I was just joking, but whatever.

01:58:59.499 --> 01:59:00.921
Definitely not that funny.

01:59:01.084 --> 01:59:02.757
It's official.

01:59:02.919 --> 01:59:04.091
You're all free.

01:59:04.171 --> 01:59:05.548
Mmm. Mmm.

01:59:08.091 --> 01:59:10.594
It wasn't half bad,
having you work for me.

01:59:12.929 --> 01:59:15.273
We all know you were
working for me, Hobbs.

01:59:15.932 --> 01:59:18.230
Agree to disagree.

01:59:18.393 --> 01:59:19.440
Thank you.

01:59:20.395 --> 01:59:21.612
Good luck.

01:59:23.273 --> 01:59:24.274
Elena?

01:59:24.441 --> 01:59:25.533
Letty.

01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:27.611
This is gonna be awkward.

01:59:28.111 --> 01:59:30.284
But sexy as hell.
Sexy as hell.

01:59:30.947 --> 01:59:33.951
I wanted to thank you for
everything you've done for him.

01:59:34.409 --> 01:59:35.752
For us.

01:59:36.286 --> 01:59:38.288
It takes an amazing woman.

01:59:40.248 --> 01:59:41.795
He's an amazing guy.

01:59:42.459 --> 01:59:43.961
Yeah, he is.

01:59:45.462 --> 01:59:47.760
Try to keep him out
of trouble, huh?

01:59:49.132 --> 01:59:51.726
Now, you know that's
not gonna happen.

01:59:52.636 --> 01:59:53.808
I know.

01:59:56.765 --> 01:59:59.109
Not bad for a cop.

02:00:06.692 --> 02:00:09.536
I never thought I'd
trust a criminal.

02:00:12.197 --> 02:00:13.949
Until next time.

02:00:14.533 --> 02:00:17.286
Until next time.

02:00:23.709 --> 02:00:24.756
Elena.

02:00:33.635 --> 02:00:35.057
You know you don't have to go.

02:00:38.056 --> 02:00:41.526
All this... This
is your family.

02:00:42.561 --> 02:00:44.404
It's who you are.

02:00:44.813 --> 02:00:46.736
This is my family.

02:00:49.067 --> 02:00:50.910
This is who I am.

02:01:09.087 --> 02:01:10.527
All right, everybody, let's eat.

02:01:10.756 --> 02:01:12.006
Want some help with that?

02:01:12.007 --> 02:01:13.554
It's all here, it's done.

02:01:14.426 --> 02:01:16.770
Come on, man, let's get with it.

02:01:19.598 --> 02:01:21.271
First bite, he's got grace.

02:01:21.433 --> 02:01:23.106
House rules, man. House rules.

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.114
Any of this feel
familiar to you?

02:01:32.235 --> 02:01:33.782
No.

02:01:36.406 --> 02:01:38.534
But it feels like home.

02:01:39.367 --> 02:01:40.710
That's good enough for me.

02:01:41.495 --> 02:01:43.998
All right, y'all. Come
on, let's do this.

02:01:44.873 --> 02:01:46.591
Okay, Roman,

02:01:48.293 --> 02:01:50.091
bless our table.

02:01:55.717 --> 02:01:58.971
Father, thank you for the
gathering of friends.

02:01:59.137 --> 02:02:01.936
Father, we give thanks for
all the choices we've made,

02:02:02.098 --> 02:02:04.692
because that's what
makes us who we are.

02:02:04.851 --> 02:02:08.572
Let us forever cherish the loved
ones we've lost along the way.

02:02:08.730 --> 02:02:10.277
Thank you for the little angel,

02:02:10.357 --> 02:02:12.325
the newest addition
to our family.

02:02:12.484 --> 02:02:14.327
Thank you for
bringing Letty home.

02:02:14.486 --> 02:02:18.161
And most of all, thank
you for fast cars.

02:04:22.364 --> 02:04:24.583
Dominic Toretto.

02:04:24.741 --> 02:04:25.993
You don't know me,

02:04:27.827 --> 02:04:29.579
but you're about to.
