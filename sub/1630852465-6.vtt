01:07.040 --> 01:09.380
- So, um, what the actual--

01:09.480 --> 01:12.620
- Okay, so, he lost
his older brother

01:12.720 --> 01:13.940
when he was a kid.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.260
That's why he still sees him.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.360
Well, that and LSD, obviously.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.820
Wait, how have you not noticed
how he talks to thin air?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.900
- Well, I've kind of had
my own shit going on.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Don't know if you've noticed.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.820
- Kosta didn't come here
for the money, okay?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.220
He flew here cause
he's a lunatic

02:05.320 --> 02:07.320
with major abandonment issues.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.140
- So this is it.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.620
Our--our lives come down
to one phone conversation

02:12.720 --> 02:16.040
between a reformed gangster
and a demented drug lord.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.340
Hell of a plan.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.220
- Okay, well, it was either
that or leave you here

02:20.320 --> 02:21.580
to get tortured,
potentially raped,

02:21.680 --> 02:24.360
and then shot.
Would you prefer that?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.840
- Okay, this may
not be working.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.180
Plan B.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.280
Hit that cop with a rock
and we'll take his gun.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.900
- [speaking Greek]

03:08.000 --> 03:10.980
- Hey, he's not looking
at us right now.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.300
You could end this all.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.300
You end him,
we all go home.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.580
- I don't have a choice here.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.740
It's not up to me.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.840
[both speaking Greek]

03:47.640 --> 03:50.540
- Why would you do this to me

03:50.640 --> 03:52.660
when you know
how much pain it causes me?

03:52.760 --> 03:54.860
- I was gonna get on
a plane tonight, okay?

03:54.960 --> 03:58.100
And just run away
just like I always have.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.260
Just fuck off
before I get hurt.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.700
But I didn't this time
because I'm so,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.700
so done making that choice
for myself.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.260
We can change, okay?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.140
We can be so much more
than we think we are.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.820
Look at your brother.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.740
I mean, he turned
his entire life around.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.580
Maybe we can do that too.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.920
- [speaking Greek]

04:24.760 --> 04:27.580
- No, my brother has always
been here

04:27.680 --> 04:30.460
when nobody else was there.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.560
It's over, Victoria.

We need to go with plan B.

- No. No, listen to me.
Listen to me!

05:03.880 --> 05:06.700
I've done my part.
You need to call your people.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.160
You've got to tell them
to let her go.

We're not gonna make it.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.300
- Okay, I won't.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.740
It's still true, though.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.340
- Look, you came back
for me, okay?

07:25.440 --> 07:27.780
Least I can do
is not let you die.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.460

07:31.560 --> 07:36.060
Not just you anyway.
I was tired.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.500
Man, I was just so tired
of going

07:39.600 --> 07:42.340
from place to place,
you know?

07:42.440 --> 07:45.140
Just thought maybe I'd get
that fucking psycho

07:45.240 --> 07:47.440
off my back for good.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.700
I thought maybe me
and you could--

07:54.800 --> 07:56.580
I don't know.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.020
There's a whole lot

07:58.120 --> 08:00.980
is what I'm getting at,
you know?

- But I was one of them, okay?
I'll--I'll take that.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.400
- I'm so sorry
that I lied to you.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.860
I freaked out when you said
you were going to the police.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.540
I only said you killed someone
to stop you.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.480
- Hey, try not to talk,
all right?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.980
- Talking's actually helping.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.300
It's helping me forget I've got
a fucking hole in my stomach.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.140
- Oh, hey, hey.
Let's--let's talk then, hey?

08:31.240 --> 08:35.100

- Luci, let's talk, uh, life, huh?

Um, tell me--tell me something,
huh?

08:48.320 --> 08:50.660
Tell me something true.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.780

08:52.880 --> 08:55.480
- Make it your thing.
Make it your thing.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.180

09:03.280 --> 09:05.140
the last thing
he said to me

09:05.240 --> 09:07.960
before he walked out on me
was...

09:10.360 --> 09:15.820
If I close my eyes,
I can...still see him saying it.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.240
"I'm just going out
to get some onions."

09:20.320 --> 09:22.620

you know,

09:22.720 --> 09:25.700

kind of situation, all right?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.500
This is just
two people talking.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.700
You know, having a chat

09:29.800 --> 09:31.780
on the way
to hospital, okay?

09:31.880 --> 09:35.620
Okay, so, uh--

09:35.720 --> 09:38.340
Hold on...

09:38.440 --> 09:42.520
you said your dad died
of colon cancer.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.140
I said say something true.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.860
- [laughs]
Ow, ow, ow.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.140

09:53.240 --> 09:54.500
I said say something true.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.180
- This is, I promise.
This is true.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.500
My dad, he genuinely--

09:59.600 --> 10:00.940
he walked out one day
for onions

10:01.040 --> 10:02.820
and he never came back.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.200
[chuckles weakly]

10:07.960 --> 10:10.180
This may be, uh...where I get

10:10.280 --> 10:12.840
my tenuous relationship
with the truth from.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.340
- Huh.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.140
You reckon?

10:19.240 --> 10:23.940
- I always thought
that he said that

10:24.040 --> 10:26.840
'cause, uh...onions
make you cry, don't they?

10:29.560 --> 10:32.340
For some reason,
they never got to me.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.900
They never made me cry.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.540
- Hey, uh...let's keep
talking, okay? Uh...

10:39.640 --> 10:41.740
say something else--
someone else--

10:41.840 --> 10:43.060
something else true.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.740
- Oh, I've got one.
I've got one.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.140
- Huh?

10:46.240 --> 10:47.860
- Um, do you want know
about the first time

10:47.960 --> 10:49.780
I saw you
for the second time?

10:49.880 --> 10:50.980
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

10:51.080 --> 10:52.260
- Yeah, tell me that.
Yeah.

10:52.360 --> 10:57.540
- Well, you and me, we--

10:57.640 --> 10:59.640
- Yeah, you and me.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.100
- When you came back
to Burnt Ridge.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.020
When you came back for me,

11:07.120 --> 11:12.160
I don't know, it kind of--
it kind of threw me, you know?

11:13.960 --> 11:17.240
I didn't know what
to think and--

11:18.720 --> 11:20.300
So I guess it's
kind of your fault

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
I blew up the diner,
if you think about it.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.700
- That was you?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.180
- Well, I didn't know

11:27.280 --> 11:29.660
that Marko was gonna
give you that note.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.060
Like, I genuinely thought

11:32.160 --> 11:34.740
that he was gonna be
the one showing up.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.200
He said he wanted
to work things out and...

11:39.520 --> 11:41.340
I didn't know
if I could trust him.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.860
Ow.
My God.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.020
Are you trying
to find potholes?

11:46.120 --> 11:48.200
- Sorry.
- Fuck.

11:50.560 --> 11:54.700
My um...my dad
was a chemistry teacher.

11:54.800 --> 11:59.140
He's, uh...he's the one to blame
for my unhealthy interest

11:59.240 --> 12:01.720
in making shit
that blows up.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.380
Oh, fuck!

- Come on, come on, uh...
so you made a bomb?

12:09.920 --> 12:14.020
- Yeah, it was, uh...it was
my insurance policy.

you gotta be careful.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.220
Please don't blow up.
Please don't blow up.

Stay with me, huh?
- How you going?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.300
- I'm fine.
I'm--I'm--I'm--I'm great.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
Why--why'd you
set the bomb off?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.980
- There was a family
coming into the diner.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.940
Sandy was outside safe.
That thing was unstable.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.620
I couldn't take the risk
of that

12:35.720 --> 12:38.000

you won't do that.

Stop talking like that, okay?

13:35.040 --> 13:37.040
Just--you're gonna be fine.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.760
You've gotta let 'em.

- It's a lot.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.540
I know.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.540
Doing our dance here
in the same place

15:14.640 --> 15:15.980
we're going to say our vows
to one another,

15:16.080 --> 15:19.020
it's--it's overwhelming.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.120
[phone ringing]

15:22.960 --> 15:24.460
- [sighs]
[phone beeps]

15:24.560 --> 15:26.560
Everything just feels
all wrong.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.500
- What's really eating
your Gilbert Grapes, Helen?

15:30.600 --> 15:33.620
[phone ringing]

15:33.720 --> 15:35.220
- Hey.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.820
[phone beeps]

15:36.920 --> 15:39.340
- Helen, I'm sorry.
I need your help.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.700
- Actually, mate,
this is Mr. Helen,

15:41.800 --> 15:43.500
and I'd appreciate it

15:43.600 --> 15:45.100
if you kept
your big Scottish nose

15:45.200 --> 15:46.780
or whatever it is
that you are,

15:46.880 --> 15:48.260
out of our business.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.060
All right?
Miss Chambers

15:50.160 --> 15:52.160
doesn't want anything
to do with you.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.820
- He sounded really upset.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.740
- That's not your problem now,
sweet pea.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.660
- He said he needed my help.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.940
- Look, we talked about this.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.780
Stay in your lane.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.620
- I'm--I'm sorry.
I have to call him back.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.380
- Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.020
We've only got this place
for another 20 minutes.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.580
- Look, I know I'm not
a proper police officer,

16:15.680 --> 16:17.020
but I'm all he has.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.260
- If you make that call,

16:19.360 --> 16:22.380
we're done.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.480
- What?

16:26.080 --> 16:28.820
If you loved me
the way that you say you do,

16:28.920 --> 16:31.900
you--you wouldn't have
to keep threatening me.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.580
- You promised.
This isn't you.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.260
- You don't know me, Ethan.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.980
I mean, not really, because--
because if you did,

16:40.080 --> 16:43.380
you'd know that this isn't
who I am anymore.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.020
This is just some place
the wind blew me.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.220
I am not the same person
that I was yesterday.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.780
I--I am not the same person

16:51.880 --> 16:54.100
that I was
before I met Elliot Stanley.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.900
- Calm down, okay?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.980
People will think you're having
another "episode."

16:59.080 --> 17:01.460
- [scoffs]

17:01.560 --> 17:03.740
You know what?

17:03.840 --> 17:06.540
Why don't you do me a favour?

17:06.640 --> 17:09.100
And go and fuck yourself, Ethan.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.780
Take something
large and ridged

17:12.880 --> 17:16.620
and go and fuck yourself,
you ridiculous human being!

17:16.720 --> 17:19.620
[triumphant guitar music]

17:19.720 --> 17:25.460
â™ª â™ª

17:25.560 --> 17:29.620
Sorry about that.
Um, are you okay?

17:29.720 --> 17:32.260
- I need you
to come and get me.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.100
- What's going on?

17:34.200 --> 17:36.860
- Everything I touch
turns to shit.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.460
I can't...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.380
I can't take it anymore.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.500
[sniffling]
Fuck. I'm sorry.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.340
I need help.
I don't know who else to call.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.380
- It's okay, I'm here,

17:50.480 --> 17:52.100
whatever's happened.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.620
- Luci's...

17:54.720 --> 17:56.580
fuck.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.620
Luci's dead.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.980
[mournful music]

18:02.080 --> 18:03.540
- Where are you?

18:03.640 --> 18:09.560
â™ª â™ª

18:20.840 --> 18:23.020
[line ringing]

18:23.120 --> 18:24.660
- Kosta?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.660
- He's dead.
Listen up.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.980
We haven't met,
but I'm the husband

18:28.080 --> 18:30.100
of the woman
you've got in there.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.160
Let me inside and we'll talk.
It's about the money.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.800
- Stop there.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.860
What's this?

18:58.960 --> 19:00.260
[bag crinkling]

19:00.360 --> 19:02.380
- It's got my piss in it.

19:02.480 --> 19:05.460
- Ugh. Okay.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.560
Where's the money?

19:09.520 --> 19:10.420
- [grunts]

19:10.520 --> 19:13.420
[dramatic music]

19:13.520 --> 19:19.380
â™ª â™ª

19:19.480 --> 19:21.480
- Are you okay?

19:24.720 --> 19:27.280
- [spits]
I'm fine.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.900
- [sighs]

19:32.000 --> 19:34.860
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my God.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.000
Oh, my God.
Oh.

19:41.760 --> 19:42.900
[static]

19:43.000 --> 19:45.140
- You see this, right?

19:45.240 --> 19:48.340
And they waltzed,
and they stepped arm in arm,

19:48.440 --> 19:51.480
straight into--
straight into the beast.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
- [speaking Russian]

20:14.840 --> 20:17.660
[soft music]

20:17.760 --> 20:21.620
â™ª â™ª

20:21.720 --> 20:23.720
[engine revs]

20:26.880 --> 20:29.200
[engine revving]

20:30.560 --> 20:33.460
[dramatic music]

20:33.560 --> 20:40.040
â™ª â™ª

20:51.240 --> 20:53.180
- All right, I'm sorry,
Lachlan, but we're gonna need

20:53.280 --> 20:57.220
you take us through that again
one more time.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.540
- Of course.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.500
I went to the Dusty Moon Motel
in Kalura.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.860
That's where
I met Elliot Stanley.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.020
And then, uh, Sergeant Lemon
showed up

21:08.120 --> 21:12.280
wanting to help, and, uh...

21:15.000 --> 21:17.460
And Probationary Constable
Helen Chambers

21:17.560 --> 21:22.380
took my gun and shot him.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.140
Uh, she just walked right up.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.220
She said that she'd been
tracking Stanley as well,

21:27.320 --> 21:30.860
and next thing,
she had my weapon, um...

21:30.960 --> 21:35.140
I had no idea they were
working together.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.940
Uh, they made me put Lemon
in the boot of my car

21:38.040 --> 21:42.100
and, uh, we drove
to the back of beyond.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.900
When we showed up
at the Stone Men,

21:44.000 --> 21:46.580
it all went to hell.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.180
Uh, Luci Miller arrives,
and, uh, I don't know her angle,

21:49.280 --> 21:52.900
but she's got multiple
passports and identities.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.700
And, uh, well, it turns out,
there's a whole lot of money

21:56.800 --> 22:00.340
buried at these Stone Men, um...

22:00.440 --> 22:02.300
the three of them
get to arguing,

22:02.400 --> 22:05.820
and soon enough
the shooting starts.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.900
No honour among thieves, right?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.140
Place was a bloodbath.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.180
[police radio chatter]

22:14.280 --> 22:18.380
I manage to get away,
and, uh...here we are.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.500
- You're aware
Constable Chambers

22:20.600 --> 22:22.260
has a different version
of events.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.020
- Oh, I'm well aware.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.860
That must be why
she stayed behind

22:25.960 --> 22:29.860
while I was at the Stone Men
so she could lie her arse off--

22:29.960 --> 22:33.420
so she could lay
this whole shit show on me.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.380
Let me ask you this.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.060
Did Constable Chambers
talk about her relationship

22:38.160 --> 22:40.340
with Elliot Stanley?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.020
- What do you mean?

22:42.120 --> 22:45.060
- A copper at Kalura Creek
spotted the two of them.

22:45.160 --> 22:49.100
I got him to do
a bit more digging, and, uh...

22:49.200 --> 22:51.860
well, it turns out the
proprietors of Casa del Nacho

22:51.960 --> 22:55.840
in Kalura
are the paranoid type.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.980
She's looking real cozy with
a suspected murderer there,

23:04.080 --> 23:05.820
wouldn't you say?

23:05.920 --> 23:10.760
I mean, does that look like a--
a hostage situation to you?

23:13.400 --> 23:16.260
Look at my work,
what I've given this place.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.900
You're gonna believe
what some hick

23:18.000 --> 23:21.800
out of Cooper Springs
says about me?

23:24.520 --> 23:27.540
- I'm sorry you had
to go through this.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.640
- [sighs, chuckles]

24:07.960 --> 24:09.500
- Local council is expected

24:09.600 --> 24:11.660
to issue fire warnings,
and why?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.980
Due to all
the drier conditions

24:13.080 --> 24:14.620
at some point tomorrow.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.260
- Hello?
- Winds will continue to swing

24:16.360 --> 24:18.460
between southeast
and southwest

24:18.560 --> 24:20.260
for much of Friday.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.100
And finally,
a warning for those

24:22.200 --> 24:23.860
out on the East Coast.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.260
Prepare for some
stormy skies ahead.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.900
Thank you. Hilary.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.180
- Thanks, Kevin.
And now for today's top story.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.060
A police officer
is wanted for murder

24:34.160 --> 24:36.060
along with this man,
whose identity

24:36.160 --> 24:38.820
has yet
to be officially confirmed.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.020
- Hello?
- Yeah, just give me a second.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.380
Stock check.
Sorry.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.060
- Okay, it's just
I'm kind of in a rush.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.260
- I'm ready when I'm ready,
love.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.980
So just keep your knickers on.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.100
- It's private for now,
but it is being reported

24:49.200 --> 24:50.780
that the deceased officer
was working

24:50.880 --> 24:53.180
with highly-decorated
Major Crime Inspector,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.660
Lachlan Rogers,

24:54.760 --> 24:56.540
who we spoke with
earlier today.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.980
- I know you in the media
all like a catchy headline,

24:59.080 --> 25:00.980
so I can see
the "Bonnie and Clyde" thing,

25:01.080 --> 25:04.700
but, uh, let's not
romanticise this, uh,

25:04.800 --> 25:06.460
these two are very dangerous.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.420
We've got a police constable
here with that training,

25:09.520 --> 25:11.580
and, uh, I would encourage
everyone to be vigilant

25:11.680 --> 25:14.260
and, uh, to keep their eyes open.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.260
- Police are urging people
to come forward

25:16.360 --> 25:18.740
if they see Probationary
Constable Chambers

25:18.840 --> 25:19.820
or this man.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.820
[tense music]

25:22.920 --> 25:29.920
â™ª â™ª

25:43.680 --> 25:46.000
- I'm sorry for calling.
I--

25:49.760 --> 25:53.360
I--I didn't know.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.940
- I'm really sorry.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.860
- What now?

25:58.960 --> 26:01.280
- I guess you haven't
seen the news.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.900
We're wanted for murder.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.740
- What the fuck?

26:09.840 --> 26:11.060
- It's Lachlan Rogers.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.420
He's--he's got everybody
turned around.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.780
- This isn't--
that's not what happened.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.700
I'll explain.
I'll explain everything.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.140
I'll tell them
you had nothing to do with it.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.820
I'll--I'll tell them
it was me.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.700
- Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure
they're not just gonna

26:22.800 --> 26:24.460
take your word for it.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.300
I mean,
you're not exactly mister...

26:27.400 --> 26:30.000
believe-the-word-of guy.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.020
- I know that woman
I keep seeing.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.100
Lena Pascal.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.180
She's in Adelaide.
Greenlanes.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.700
Whatever the fuck that means.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.060
Guess I'm never gonna find out.
- Wait, how do you know that?

26:45.160 --> 26:48.060
- I saw these, um,
pieces of my life,

26:48.160 --> 26:50.500
of who I was
or how I got here.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.380
Like memories, I suppose,
but I can't believe them.

26:53.480 --> 26:57.560
They were all inside out,
just fucking weird.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.180
You know who I worked for?

27:01.280 --> 27:06.140
This Kosta guy.
I was his accountant.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.620
- Really?
- What was I thinking?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.900
Why did I do that?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.540
- Well, you must've
had your reasons.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.800
- It'd be nice to know
what they were.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.460
- Well, I--
I should report this.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.700
- I thought you said
nobody would believe us.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.660
- They won't.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.020
And then we'll both
take the fall

27:28.120 --> 27:29.820
for something
that we didn't do.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.940
It's really--

27:32.040 --> 27:33.980
- Unfair?

27:34.080 --> 27:36.080
- Yeah.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.780
I don't like unfairness.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.420
- Me neither.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.420
[dramatic music]

27:46.520 --> 27:51.040
â™ª â™ª

27:53.520 --> 27:57.020
So what exactly do we do now?

27:57.120 --> 27:59.380
- We get further away, um,

27:59.480 --> 28:02.160
and then we call in with
the location of Luc--

28:03.440 --> 28:05.220
where she is.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.060
We can't just leave her
out there.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.260
- And then?

28:10.360 --> 28:12.460
- And then we find a way
to prove Lachlan's lying.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.620
- How?

28:13.720 --> 28:17.500
- I'm--I'm working on it.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.100
- That simple, huh?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.200
[sighs]

28:24.680 --> 28:27.560
Do you think
you're a good person, Helen?

28:29.480 --> 28:31.920
For what it's worth,
I think you are.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.940
I mean, all you've done
is try to help me,

28:36.040 --> 28:39.660
and I just keep
dragging you down.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.300
- Actually,
if it wasn't for you,

28:42.400 --> 28:45.860
I'd still be getting married.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.580
- Mr. Ethan Krum?

28:47.680 --> 28:50.300
- Is no more.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.280
He's not dead.
He's just--you know.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.900
This is the new me now.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.580
Life after Ethan.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.860
New chapter.

29:02.960 --> 29:06.980
[police siren wailing]

29:07.080 --> 29:08.660
Holy crumpets.

29:08.760 --> 29:11.020
- That was a short chapter.
- Yeah.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.940
- Just pull over and
I'll explain that it was me.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.980
That it was my fault.
- It's too late for that.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.340
- Just--just pull over.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.500
- That's the old Helen, okay?

29:18.600 --> 29:20.820
This--this is the new Helen.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.180
- So what are we gonna do,
new Helen?

29:23.280 --> 29:25.460
- Buckle up.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.220
And forgive me, 'cause
I'm about to bend my rules

29:27.320 --> 29:29.320
on the speed limit.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.180
[engine roaring]

29:33.280 --> 29:36.380
[siren wailing]

29:36.480 --> 29:39.380
[dramatic Western music]

29:39.480 --> 29:46.480
â™ª â™ª

29:55.720 --> 29:56.820
- [sighs]

29:56.920 --> 30:00.380
[phone ringing]

30:00.480 --> 30:02.980
- Rogers.

30:03.080 --> 30:05.100
Where?

30:05.200 --> 30:08.540
You sure
it's Constable Chambers' car?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.700
Okay.
I want everything on this.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.100
Everything.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.100
Do not let the fuckers
get away.

30:14.200 --> 30:21.200
â™ª â™ª

30:24.640 --> 30:27.640
[tyres screeching]

30:41.480 --> 30:43.480
- Oh, God.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.160
- Shit.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.740
- Wait, how--
how fast were you going

30:53.840 --> 30:55.180
when you came out
of the Dusty Moon Motel?

30:55.280 --> 30:56.740
When you were with Lachlan.
- Fast?

30:56.840 --> 30:59.620
- How--how fast and--
and which way did you go?

30:59.720 --> 31:01.900
- Left? I think.
I don't know.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.340
Why?
- Okay.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.700
- Throw your weapons
out of the vehicle.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.100
- Okay, um, we--we need
to buy some time.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.500
I need--I need time.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.900
- How much?
- Like, an hour or two.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I--I think I have an idea.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.840
- You're gonna think
I'm fucking mental.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.220
[police radio chatter]

31:29.320 --> 31:31.740
- What are they doing?
[engine revs]

31:31.840 --> 31:34.280
Let's go.
[siren wailing]

31:40.280 --> 31:42.220
[woman screams]

31:42.320 --> 31:44.260
[onlookers shouting]

31:44.360 --> 31:46.060
- Right, I know you're all...
- We're gonna need...

31:46.160 --> 31:47.440
- trying to enjoy your lunch--
- everyone to remain calm.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.940
You--you--you go.
- Oh, no, no, no, you go.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.300
- You go.
No, you go.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.420
- Are--are you sure?
- Yeah, really.

31:51.520 --> 31:52.980
- Okay.
Yeah, um, okay.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.940
So look,
we don't want to hurt anyone.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.300
- Pick up the phone,

31:57.400 --> 31:59.680
and I'll blow
your fucking head off!

32:00.920 --> 32:02.980
Another step,
and I will shoot people dead.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.380
Back off.
Back off!

32:05.480 --> 32:06.900
- Okay.
- Back off!

32:07.000 --> 32:11.340
- Okay, um, we're not here
to cause anyone any harm.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.140
Just sit down...
- If you don't do what I say...

32:13.240 --> 32:15.240
- and this will be over soon.
- I'm gonna start shooting.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.140
[phone ringing]

32:18.240 --> 32:20.260
- Rogers.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.580
Okay, I'm on my way.
Just remember.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.220
Helen Chambers and
Elliot Stanley are dangerous.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.620
If you get a clear shot,
I want you to take it.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.900
- Go! Go!

32:31.000 --> 32:33.620
[indistinct chatter]

32:33.720 --> 32:37.240
[siren wailing]

32:40.360 --> 32:43.060
- How quick can you get them
to me?

32:43.160 --> 32:45.820
Yeah, no, I know.
It's just--

32:45.920 --> 32:48.660
well, it's kind of urgent here.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.700
Look, if there's nothing,
there's nothing,

32:50.800 --> 32:53.440
but I just have to hope
I'm right.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.980
- No one fires until my order.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.380
- Copy that.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.680
[dog barking]

33:03.640 --> 33:06.860
[line ringing]

33:06.960 --> 33:09.240
[phone ringing]

33:11.000 --> 33:12.820
- Yep.
- My name's Nathan Wong.

33:12.920 --> 33:15.540
I've been asked to come
speak to you today,

33:15.640 --> 33:17.380
see what we can do here.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.940
You've seen the news?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.540
They're calling you
Bonnie and Clyde.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.180
- No, never saw it.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.860
Unless it's the one
where the guy and the girl

33:23.960 --> 33:26.660
hold up a Spicy Wings
and then they walk away unhurt

33:26.760 --> 33:28.340
and actually get a reward

33:28.440 --> 33:30.860
for being the victims of
a gross miscarriage of justice?

33:30.960 --> 33:32.820
- [chuckles]
I like you.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.140
You're funny.
- Okay.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.780
- I'm talking
to Elliot Stanley, right?

33:36.880 --> 33:38.380
Can I call you Elliot?

33:38.480 --> 33:39.740
- Knock yourself out.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.420
- Okay, now,
listen up there, Elliot.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.020
What we're gonna need--
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.660
You're not the one
calling the shots here.

33:44.760 --> 33:47.060
You listen to me,
Nathan Wong.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.160
Here's the deal.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.220
[whispers]
What's the deal?

33:53.320 --> 33:54.900
- The deal is,
we need more time.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.260
- Yeah.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.020
- You need to ask them
for something.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.300
Anything.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.780
- Okay, here's the deal.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.340
- Ask them for something
you actually want.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.340
What do you want?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.060
- I need you to find
someone for me.

34:10.160 --> 34:11.300
You bring them here
to Devil's Rock,

34:11.400 --> 34:12.660
and then this all ends.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.300
Her name's Lena Pascal.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.260
She's in Adelaide.
Greenlanes.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.140
I don't know if that's a shop
or a place,

34:19.240 --> 34:21.580
or--that's all I know.

34:21.680 --> 34:25.060
- Elliot, I need you
to listen to me now.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.420
It's gonna ta--
- No, you--

34:26.520 --> 34:28.100
you listen to me.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.140
Do what I say,
or I start shooting.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.580
[customers whimper]

34:31.680 --> 34:32.660
- [softly] No, he won't.
- I mean it, Nathan.

34:32.760 --> 34:33.980
If people try to move in here,

34:34.080 --> 34:35.660
I will shoot
their fucking brains out.

34:35.760 --> 34:36.700
- [softly]
Don't worry. Don't worry.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.960
He won't, okay?

34:43.600 --> 34:44.940
- What're you doing?

34:45.040 --> 34:47.980
- Well, I don't want
to scare people.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.500
- If they don't think
we're being serious,

34:49.600 --> 34:51.060
they'll just get up and leave.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.280
Then we'll be arrested,
and this whole thing--

34:52.360 --> 34:54.340
- Okay, but--

34:54.440 --> 34:57.460
you wouldn't actually
kill anyone, would you?

34:57.560 --> 34:59.420
- No, I mean...

34:59.520 --> 35:00.980
no, but, you know,

35:01.080 --> 35:03.580
maybe I'd shoot them
in the legs or something.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.580
- You want to put someone
in a wheelchair?

35:05.680 --> 35:08.960
- No, I don't--
I don't want to, but...

35:10.840 --> 35:12.140
We don't--

35:12.240 --> 35:13.940
we don't want to hurt you,
all right?

35:14.040 --> 35:17.420
We don't wanna kill you.
Um...

35:17.520 --> 35:20.660
But I am prepared to shoot you
in the legs, all right?

35:20.760 --> 35:22.580
And, look, I've never been
shot in the legs before,

35:22.680 --> 35:24.700
but I'd--
I'd say it's probably not

35:24.800 --> 35:28.660
that great of an experience,
so, um...

35:28.760 --> 35:30.980
thank you.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.980
[tense music]

35:34.080 --> 35:41.080
â™ª â™ª

35:57.120 --> 35:58.540
- Here you go. Right.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.860
[soft indistinct chatter]

36:00.960 --> 36:02.960
- Thank you.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.900
- She'll call.

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
â™ª â™ª

36:23.600 --> 36:25.340
- Where we at?

36:25.440 --> 36:29.360
- You know, I um, I remembered
something else about, uh, about us.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.780
- Us?
- Yeah.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.820
- That night at the Dusty Moon
when we, um--

36:34.920 --> 36:36.920
- It's over, Elliot.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.940
Soon as you get a clear shot,
you hear me?

36:43.040 --> 36:45.040
- Yes, sir.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.620
[line ringing]

36:47.720 --> 36:50.720
[phone ringing]

36:54.560 --> 36:56.020
- Yeah?

36:56.120 --> 36:59.580
- Thought we could talk
on a private line.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.420
- Guess who.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.980
- [sighs]

37:03.080 --> 37:06.100
- What exactly do you hope
to achieve here?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.260
- Well, you know, it's nice
just to see your face,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.980
but, um, Lena Pascal.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.140
What about her?
You got her yet?

37:13.240 --> 37:15.460
- Yeah, seems Nathan Wong
doesn't mess about.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.460
She's on her way from Adelaide
as we speak.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.660
But are you seriously
expecting me to believe

37:20.760 --> 37:22.940
that you're holding up
this whole place

37:23.040 --> 37:26.460
just so you can--
what, speak to some woman?

37:26.560 --> 37:27.660
- And do you expect
everyone to believe

37:27.760 --> 37:28.940
that you're a victim?

37:29.040 --> 37:32.140
That you didn't do
what you did?

37:32.240 --> 37:35.100
- Give it up.
Step outside.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.700
- How do you live
with yourself?

37:36.800 --> 37:38.300
- I'm not a bad person.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.460
I'm just trying to keep
my head above water.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.740
- See, that's the problem.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.900
You put your foot in shit,

37:44.000 --> 37:45.780
you end up covered in shit.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.860
You may as well
go the whole way--

37:47.960 --> 37:49.820
get shit in your ears
and up your nose

37:49.920 --> 37:52.740
and under your fucking eyelids.

37:52.840 --> 37:56.340
- You do what you have to
for the people you love.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.340
And also, that's really
fucking disgusting.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.220
I chose to spend
my final moments

38:02.320 --> 38:03.620
on Earth
with the woman I love.

38:03.720 --> 38:05.900
You, on the other hand,

38:06.000 --> 38:10.100
chose to spend yours
at Ronny's Spicy Wings.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.740
Pretty sure I win.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
[phone dings]

38:16.960 --> 38:18.860
[phone chimes]

38:18.960 --> 38:20.960
- [chuckles]

38:23.840 --> 38:27.940
Actually, um,
I don't think you do win.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.540
[soulful music]

38:31.640 --> 38:33.540
- [laughs softly]

38:33.640 --> 38:36.740
â™ª â™ª

38:36.840 --> 38:39.380
I asked my friend Freddie
to retrieve something for me.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.380
How do I put this? Uh...

38:41.480 --> 38:43.740
oh, yeah.

38:43.840 --> 38:47.020
It's from something that shoots
but never kills.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.260
- What, like a--
a potato gun?

38:49.360 --> 38:52.660
- Turn on your speaker
and check your messages.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.660
When I saw a speed limit drop
like that

38:54.760 --> 38:56.500
near roadworks
on that kind of road,

38:56.600 --> 38:58.780
I knew there'd be
a speed camera, see?

38:58.880 --> 39:01.300
And Elliot told me
how fast you were going.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.100
You lied.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.060
Your version of events doesn't
really match that photo,

39:05.160 --> 39:06.500
does it?
[phones chiming]

39:06.600 --> 39:08.180
Oh, that's just been sent

39:08.280 --> 39:10.700
to every single department
in the state,

39:10.800 --> 39:13.780
just so you really get
the message here, which is,

39:13.880 --> 39:17.080
you're seven different kinds
of fucked.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.100
[keys jingling]

39:28.200 --> 39:31.200
[door slams, locks turn]

39:38.800 --> 39:41.460
- Hey.
You're out and about.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.820
- I am.
[chuckles]

39:43.920 --> 39:47.260
I gather you told them
you made me do it all.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.780
- Yeah.
I'm glad they believed me.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.180
- Well, you should be out

39:52.280 --> 39:53.900
after your bail hearing
tomorrow morning.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.260
And just remember.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.780
Lachlan Rogers
is the big fish here,

39:56.880 --> 39:58.780
so testify against him,

39:58.880 --> 40:01.420
and you should get
a suspended sentence.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.940
- I feel like I've been living
in one of those

40:03.040 --> 40:05.740
since the car crash.

40:05.840 --> 40:09.060
- Well, that body
that you found in Murray Waters

40:09.160 --> 40:12.780
had Billy Nixon's DNA
all over the shop there, so...

40:12.880 --> 40:15.280
you're in the clear
on that one, at least.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.660
What was it, by the way?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.820
In the restaurant?

40:22.920 --> 40:25.500
There was something
that you said

40:25.600 --> 40:29.180
you remembered about us.

40:29.280 --> 40:32.620
- Oh, yeah, um...

40:32.720 --> 40:34.260
That night, the night we--

40:34.360 --> 40:35.820
- Yeah.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.340
Did we?

40:38.440 --> 40:40.500
- No, we--we didn't.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.820
Um...

40:42.920 --> 40:44.700
We did kiss, though.

40:44.800 --> 40:47.020
- Oh. [chuckles]
- Mm-hmm.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.300
- [laughs softly]

40:49.400 --> 40:52.300
Um, uh, I got you something.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.860
[laughs]
Um, it's just...

40:54.960 --> 40:56.940
I put my number in there,

40:57.040 --> 41:00.220
in case you ever want to...

41:00.320 --> 41:02.320
you know, yeah.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.820
Oh, fuck it,
just one of those days

41:06.920 --> 41:10.920
where you do things you never
thought you'd do, so...

41:23.680 --> 41:26.520

41:29.320 --> 41:31.020
[keys jingling]

41:31.120 --> 41:33.120
- This way, please.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.580
- She's--she's here.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.260
- Who?
- They found her.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.700
They brought her all the way up
from Adelaide.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.800
Lena Pascal.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.260
I hope you find out

I'm--I'm Elliot.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.060
Elliot Stanley.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.460
I've been...

42:27.560 --> 42:31.060
Christ,
I've been looking for you.

42:31.160 --> 42:34.100
Do you...

42:34.200 --> 42:36.220
do you know who I am?

42:36.320 --> 42:40.140
- So it's true--
what the police told me.

42:40.240 --> 42:43.740
You remember nothing, huh?

42:43.840 --> 42:45.700
This is not a game?

42:45.800 --> 42:47.820
- No.

[ominous music]

44:04.920 --> 44:06.920
A shit and swallow...

44:17.040 --> 44:19.000

46:04.280 --> 46:06.280
Elliot Stanley.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.140
I'm sorry.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.680
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.600

You're free to go
until your hearing.

47:05.520 --> 47:08.700
Do not leave the state.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.260
- I'm--I'm--I'm free?

47:10.360 --> 47:11.580
- Yep.

47:11.680 --> 47:14.580
- But I--the statement.

47:14.680 --> 47:17.740
I--I--I told you about
Lena Pascal, about what I did.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.340
- We spoke to Miss Pascal.

47:19.440 --> 47:22.600
She said you had her mixed up
with someone else.

47:24.480 --> 47:26.140
- So I can't even
get myself arrested

47:26.240 --> 47:28.620
for all this horrible shit
that I've done?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.720
- Lucky you.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.280
[phone ringing]

47:58.720 --> 48:00.300
- Burnt Lodge.
Sue speaking.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.300
the guy who couldn't remember
who he was.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.020
- Oh.

48:06.120 --> 48:09.660
- I, um...I can't fix the shit
I brought to your door,

48:09.760 --> 48:13.860
nothing can,
but there's something.

48:13.960 --> 48:18.420
There's a sign--
a sign to, uh, nowhere.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.780
I've texted you
where it is on a map

48:20.880 --> 48:24.820
and, uh, I've left something there
for you.

48:24.920 --> 48:28.220
It won't change anything,
but, um,

48:28.320 --> 48:32.220
I don't know, it's, uh,
it's something.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.220
I'm sorry, Sue.

- Yeah.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.040
- Can you tell me your name?

49:46.120 --> 49:48.120
- Elliot.

Elliot Stanley.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.520
[sirens wailing]

50:19.080 --> 50:23.300
- The cop at the station
told me what you said.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.780
Made me sick...

50:25.880 --> 50:28.300
that I even knew you.

50:28.400 --> 50:31.780
- But you do know me.
You know that's not me.

50:31.880 --> 50:35.220
- You're saying she's lying?

50:35.320 --> 50:37.580
Just tell me this is all
some big mistake, that--

50:37.680 --> 50:39.100
that you don't actually
believe her.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.700
- No, no one can find
anything out about me.

50:40.800 --> 50:41.940
You know that?

50:42.040 --> 50:43.620
No friends.
No family.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.460
I don't know
if any of the stuff

50:45.560 --> 50:49.020
I remember is--is real,
or it's just fucking LSD.

50:49.120 --> 50:50.380
- Stop, okay?

50:50.480 --> 50:52.860
Just--just please stop
with the poor me.

50:52.960 --> 50:54.460
- We don't know why
I was working for Kosta.

50:54.560 --> 50:55.780
We don't know how I met Lena.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.540
We don't know why
I ever asked her

50:57.640 --> 50:59.300
to do what she did.
- It doesn't matter.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.020
You do something like that,

51:01.120 --> 51:05.640
there is no reason on Earth
that ever makes that okay.

51:08.080 --> 51:12.060
Why'd you have to be that guy?

51:12.160 --> 51:16.080
Of all the guys, why that guy?

51:21.640 --> 51:24.880
- You're my only friend
in the whole wide world, right?

51:28.160 --> 51:30.160

- Mango crazy.

52:17.320 --> 52:18.620
Guy at the bar said
it's because

52:18.720 --> 52:20.860
it makes a man go crazy.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.940
I don't know what it does
to a woman.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.780
Hopefully, gets her nice

- It's that bloke, isn't it?

52:38.440 --> 52:39.980
Go on, tell me.

52:40.080 --> 52:42.980
- I don't want to talk
about it.

â™ª â™ª

52:55.480 --> 52:57.860
I just don't understand

52:57.960 --> 53:01.940
how the same guy who could
do something so awful

53:02.040 --> 53:04.380
could also save my life,

53:04.480 --> 53:07.060
and--and give a woman
he hardly knows

53:07.160 --> 53:10.640

I just don't know
what I'm supposed to think

53:14.800 --> 53:16.860
about that...

53:16.960 --> 53:19.200
about him.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.740
- Listen.

53:23.840 --> 53:25.180
20 years ago,

53:25.280 --> 53:27.380
I come back home
and caught a guy

53:27.480 --> 53:29.940
going through my underwear,

53:30.040 --> 53:33.660
sniffing my underpants
like they were roses.

53:33.760 --> 53:38.540
He was this lodger
studying entomology.

53:38.640 --> 53:39.900
Bugs.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.980
You're getting the picture, right?

53:42.080 --> 53:44.020
- Um, I think so?

53:44.120 --> 53:46.340
- Total freak.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.900
Anyway,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.180
that's Dave.

53:51.280 --> 53:52.660
- Hold on, that--that's--

53:52.760 --> 53:56.660
- Yep, that's the man
I ended up marrying.

53:56.760 --> 53:59.100
I don't tell it a lot,

53:59.200 --> 54:00.780
as a story, 'cause--

54:00.880 --> 54:02.660
- Right.

You and this guy--

54:15.280 --> 54:17.660
this could be the prologue

54:24.240 --> 54:27.060

54:27.160 --> 54:29.140
I mean, this guy, he--

54:29.240 --> 54:32.860
he wanted so badly
to remember who he was.

54:32.960 --> 54:36.880
And now that he has,
he can't forget...

54:38.720 --> 54:41.980
And neither can I.

54:42.080 --> 54:44.340
- Can't forget what he did,
