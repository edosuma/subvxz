00:07.308 --> 00:09.510
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.312

my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.345 --> 00:12.313
Gray Chandler Murray.

they think I'm an adult.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.584
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.617 --> 00:19.420
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.354
Jeremy's gone.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.223
He took all the

00:22.256 --> 00:24.058
There are 200 girls
at this school.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.493

to go after mine?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.828
Billy, I think
you have this all wrong.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.564
If I work this
out with Dakota,

00:30.598 --> 00:32.400
I can be a better
mother to you.

JANE: Does that mean
you're leaving?

00:34.102 --> 00:35.236
I'm gonna quit the play.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.304
No, you don't
have to do that.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.605
I think
we both know that I do.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.207
Baseball wants me.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.609
They're signing me to
a minor league contract.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.078
I gotta get
on the team bus,
in an hour.

I'm gonna miss you.

of a waste of time.

like an outsider
at this school, and...

Then after I got back
I just felt like
even more of an outsider.

But then you
showed up here, Zoe.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.740
And suddenly
things felt different.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.977
Then I saw you with Nick
and I guess I just...

09:04.011 --> 09:06.113
I don't know.
I got afraid that it...

09:06.146 --> 09:07.781

That it was just all
too good to be true.

at the appropriate

a little out of control

fizzles out,

you should totally
swing by.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.667
It's over.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.435
What do you mean
it's over?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.972
Unless Jeremy appears,
designs in hand,
by 5:00 pm, Saturday,

10:39.006 --> 10:40.708
Harrods is pulling the plug.
End of story.

10:40.741 --> 10:41.809
Just tell your people.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.011
My people
don't want words.
They want results.

10:44.044 --> 10:44.978
And the hot shot
British designer

10:45.012 --> 10:47.681
working on the line
that you promised them.

10:47.715 --> 10:48.916
We're making do
without Jeremy.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.718
Donovan and I feel that
Eli is very capable...

10:50.751 --> 10:53.220
Harrods doesn't want
some nobody designer
like Eli.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.421
OTaken..

10:54.454 --> 10:56.957
Look, I modified
Jeremy's designs for
the preview party

10:56.990 --> 10:58.025
and I can do it again.

10:58.058 --> 10:58.992
No, you can't.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.894
We got lucky sneaking
a few replica pieces

11:00.928 --> 11:02.162
past them at the preview.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.964
But now they want
Jeremy Jones.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.133
They want his work.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.835
You need to find him
and get him back.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.102
Why would I want
Jeremy back?

11:09.136 --> 11:11.138
He's a quitter
and a traitor.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.007
Because without him,
the Harrods collaboration
with Donovan Decker is over.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.844
And so are all of us.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.895
Which is what?

11:34.928 --> 11:38.465
Well, either you're
riveted by the mitochondria,

11:38.498 --> 11:40.968
or severely bummed out.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.870
Is "both" an option?

11:42.903 --> 11:43.904
(LAUGHS)

11:45.172 --> 11:46.874
What's going on with you?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.142
I just got a lot
on my mind right now.

11:49.176 --> 11:53.513
If you'd told me
a year ago that I was
gonna join the school play

11:53.546 --> 11:55.182
I would'v(LAUGHS)d at you.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.285
And if you had told me

11:58.318 --> 12:01.755
I'd be this bummed out
after dropping out of
the school play,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.290
I would've laughed harder.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.525
I don't know.
I think it was
just helping

12:05.558 --> 12:07.294
take my mind off of
my injury, you know?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.797
It's crazy, huh?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.164
Not crazy.

12:11.198 --> 12:16.169
Who knew something that
seemed so ridiculous
could mean so much?

12:16.203 --> 12:19.773
I'm confused.
If it means so much,
then why'd you quit?

12:19.807 --> 12:21.274
Because of the whole
Zoe thing.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.777
I mean, I could tell
it bugged Billy.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.078
Billy told you to quit?

12:25.112 --> 12:26.246
No. No, no, no.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.916
But he didn't tell me
not to quit.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.952
He's my friend and...

12:31.985 --> 12:33.921
After what I did
with Lulu...

12:37.057 --> 12:39.059
I just wanted to do
the right thing this time.

You know,
it's better this way.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.242
So, should I bring anything
to the party tonight?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.577
Uh, yeah.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.980

and a bunch of people.

is gonna be there.

you're at Jane's.

you're never not
at Jane's?

Ever since Ben
went off to
conquer baseball,

13:26.874 --> 13:29.843
Jane's been a little freaked
to be home alone at night,

13:29.877 --> 13:31.945
so I've been
staying with her.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.116

I can't be
on stage with Nick,
you know, acting,

14:08.681 --> 14:11.351
but it's okay for you
to spend the night
at Jane's every night?

how unfair that is?

what to say to you.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.970
Unfair?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.905
As in she wants you
to stop spending the night?

14:31.939 --> 14:34.241
Ah, she didn't
say that exactly,

14:34.274 --> 14:37.310
but it did seem to be
the general sentiment

14:37.344 --> 14:38.778
before she
stormed out of class.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.448
Well, did you explain to her
that you've been sleeping
over at my house

14:41.481 --> 14:42.582
since we were
eight years old?

14:42.615 --> 14:45.152
Yeah. It wasn't
a very helpful
nugget to throw in.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.455
Billy, look.
I like Zoe. I do.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.924
But you've known her
for exactly ten weeks.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.993
And you've known me
for ten years.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.694
I know. I know.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.264
But you're the one who
told me to apologize.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.332
So...

14:59.366 --> 15:01.068
She thinks that
it isn't fair.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.003
This is because you told Nick
to quit the play, isn't it?

15:03.036 --> 15:04.171
I didn't tell him to quit.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.173
You didnRegardless. not to.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.976
She obviously thinks
that there's one set
of rules for her

15:09.009 --> 15:11.711
and another special
set of rules for you.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.947

What is that
supposed to mean?

I hate the new decor?

reminding me. Again.

a last look
around the place.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.735
I'm leaving.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.337
For the day?

21:44.371 --> 21:45.605
(SIGHS) For good.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.875
I'd say goodbye
but as you know,
I don't like you very much.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.878
Yeah, I know.
But what about the
Harrods collaboration?

21:52.712 --> 21:53.780
It's over.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.914
Are you being serious?

21:56.115 --> 21:57.283
Right.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.420
But everybody's been
working so hard.
It can't be over.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.888
Jeremy is gone,
no one can find him.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.625
Which means
it very much can be,
and very much is over.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.560
Jeremy.

22:07.594 --> 22:11.364
The collaboration is done,
and so is my career.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.600
On the bright side,
I won't ever have to
ever see you again,

22:13.633 --> 22:15.535
which almost
makes it all worth it.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.405
Well...

22:18.438 --> 22:20.407
IndWhat?ait!

22:21.541 --> 22:22.809
Jeremy called me.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.654
Where in London exactly?

22:34.687 --> 22:35.855
He didn't say.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.123
And you didn't think
to ask him?

22:37.156 --> 22:38.825
How do you function?

22:40.427 --> 22:42.395
Try him again.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.930
You're not listening, India.
I did try.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.632
At least
half a dozen times.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.667
He said what he needed to say,
and he hung up the phone.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.569
And now
I can't reach him.

22:49.602 --> 22:50.703
What did he have to say?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.673
That he was sorry.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.576
And that he didn't
care about Donovan
or the collaboration.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.445
That's it. We're done.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.912
There's gotta be a way.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.814
You're right.
There is.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.616
Let's you and I
sit here for the
next 20 hours

23:03.650 --> 23:04.717
and hope for a miracle.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.421
I think I have
a better idea.

23:13.660 --> 23:14.727
HTommy.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.696
Whatever.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.698
So I heard
you guys are having
a little party tonight.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.832
Oh, we did this already.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.768
You told us it was cute.

23:21.801 --> 23:24.604
Yes, well...
I have an idea.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.907
Oh, wait. One second.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.942
Yeah. Okay.
Check this out.
It's super cool.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.845
Every ding that you hear
is another person
coming to our party.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.214
Cool. So, anyway...

23:35.247 --> 23:37.917
I was just
(thinking that)

23:37.950 --> 23:39.719
it would probably
be best if...

23:39.752 --> 23:42.689
Hey, you should
swing by tonight.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.691
Could always use
another "ding,"
you know.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.995
Oh, wait, that's right.
Aren't you having
a party tonight, too?

23:49.028 --> 23:50.663
With an ice luge.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.664
Sounds pretty cool.

23:51.698 --> 23:52.999
It will be cool.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.701
Well, in that case,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.770
maybe you could
take a little of
our spill-over.

23:58.771 --> 23:59.772
Your party's stupid.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.774
Oh, another one.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.677
Hey, Harper.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.679
Still coming to my
gathering tonight?

24:06.713 --> 24:08.881
The ice luge will be
flowing at 9:00.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.652
Yeah, thanks for the invite,
but I think
I'm gonna got to Jane's.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.054
No offense,
but, no parents.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.825
(SIGHS)

24:18.858 --> 24:20.793
I love my parents.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.030
INDIA:
Are you sure?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.598
It's the only way.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.767
We have to talk to Gray.
If we move quickly...

24:27.800 --> 24:29.836
WBOTH: Nothing.?

24:29.869 --> 24:31.538
That was convincing.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.805
Come with me, please.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.844
It's nothing.
It's just, uh...

24:37.877 --> 24:39.712
Jeremy.
He called today.

24:39.746 --> 24:40.847
He called India?

24:40.880 --> 24:42.048
No. Me.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.516
Oh, really?

24:43.550 --> 24:44.551
Yeah, but it was nothing.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.785
Yeah, you mentioned that.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.721
He is just...
It's complicated.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.489
Yeah.
It always is
with you.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.926
Uh, can I help?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.095
Uh, can you stop time?
(LAUGHS)

24:56.929 --> 24:58.397
I wish I could.

24:58.430 --> 25:02.101
Speaking of time,
I'd actually like to get
a little more of it with you.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.737
I'd like that, too.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.272
I can't stop time
or anything,

25:06.305 --> 25:08.074
but I can take you
to a movie tonight.
If you let me.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.942
(LAUGHS) I'd love to
go to a movie.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.612
Oh, but I'm supposed
to be having
this party tonight...

25:12.645 --> 25:13.780
Great. I'll stop by
after work.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.816
Or not.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.052
Uh, it's just...
It wasn't even my idea.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.855
Billy thought that
we should have
the party. So...

25:22.889 --> 25:23.790
"Best friend" Billy?

25:23.823 --> 25:25.024
Yeah.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.626
And you wouldn't even
have any fun because

25:26.659 --> 25:28.094
it is totally
not your crowd.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.762
Yeah. Okay.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.799
I'm sorry. I just...

25:32.832 --> 25:34.867
Look. Is this
because of my age?

25:34.901 --> 25:36.168
What?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.605
Is it because
I'm a little bit younger
than you, is that it?

25:38.638 --> 25:39.872
You think I'm not

25:39.906 --> 25:40.873
mature enough
to hang out with
your friends?

25:40.907 --> 25:42.308
Trust me,
that is not it.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.576
Well, then,
did I do something

25:43.610 --> 25:44.611
because I feel like
I did something.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.579
No. It's not you,
it's me.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.080
Ouch.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.083
Look, I just don't know
how to merge my work
and personal life just yet.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.518
Because it's complicated.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.954
All right. Well,
I definitely don't want to
complicate things for you.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.856
Interrupting.
We need to do this now.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.124
Do what?

25:58.157 --> 26:01.127
You see this loop?
You're not in it.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.394
Yeah.
I'm sensing a theme.

26:02.428 --> 26:05.898
Look, we have to go
talk to Gray and
you're coming with us.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.770
Where in London?

26:10.803 --> 26:12.071
He didn't actually say.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.405
YouThank you.k?

26:13.439 --> 26:16.609
I didn't have time.
He was really quick
to get off the phone

26:16.643 --> 26:18.678
and I was trying to explain
the Harrods situation.

26:18.711 --> 26:19.879
So he knows the situation?

26:19.912 --> 26:20.980
I think so.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.014
Damn it, Jane.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.115
What did you talk about?

26:25.051 --> 26:27.920
He called to apologize.
To me.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.958
And to be honest,
he didn't seem
very ready to come back.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.893
And that's why I think
someone has to go get him.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.862
Is there even
timBarely.hat?

26:35.895 --> 26:37.029
Jane should go.

26:37.063 --> 26:37.997
Jane?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.867
And who do you
suggest I send,
Eli? You?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.101
He hates you.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.169
Can't argue with that.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.705
Then No.l go.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.106
You can't stop me
from going.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.775
In case
you've forgotten, Gray,

26:48.808 --> 26:49.876
I don't work
for you anymore.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.177
True. But think
about it, India.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.980
All alone in London,
and feeling guilty.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.715
And who did Jeremy call
to bare his soul?

26:55.748 --> 26:57.684
Was No.you?

26:58.417 --> 26:59.852
It wasn't me.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.923
Eli, can I speak
with Jane alone, please?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.091
Yeah. No problem.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.463
Gray, I'm not sure I feel

27:11.497 --> 27:14.901
comfortable using my
friendship with Jeremy
to bring him back.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.936
That's not why
I'm asking you to go.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.038
Of course not.

27:19.071 --> 27:22.074
I'm asking you because
you're the most qualified

27:22.108 --> 27:24.110
and you're the
only person I trust.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.246
Now, go pack your bags.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.689
Whoa, whoa.
You're kidding, right?

27:36.723 --> 27:38.124
This, this is a joke.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.358
I'm packing, aren't I?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.961
I thought you were
just really selling it
for the laugh.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.696
Come on! London?

27:43.730 --> 27:45.131
I'm seriously having trouble
processing right now.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.632
Yeah.
You're not the only one.

27:46.665 --> 27:51.103
You're going to miss
the most epic party
of our party throwing career.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.840
Isn't this the only party
of our party throwing career?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.274
Yes! Exactly!

27:57.509 --> 28:00.679
Janey. Your party
starts in an hour.

28:01.748 --> 28:03.783
You can't go.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.185
Look, I didn't
volunteer for this.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.821
I'm so sorry.
I wish I was staying.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.256
Trust me.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.825
But I guess if the party
is a total bust

28:12.859 --> 28:16.495
you can always finish the
hem on Prince Charming's
pants for me.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.765
Yeah. Dude,
if the party is a bust,
I'm going to Harper's.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.203
I can't believe
I'm gonna miss
our first real party.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.872
It's not gonna be
that cool, is it?

28:25.905 --> 28:27.506
It's you and me, Janey.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.776
Let's be honest.
How cool could it be?

28:35.547 --> 28:36.783
Any luck?

28:37.516 --> 28:39.318
Nothing terribly helpful.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.889
Where are you Jeremy?

28:44.957 --> 28:46.292
INDIA: What?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.895
Nothing.
It's just, uh,

28:48.928 --> 28:51.063
kind of obvious
you're still into the guy.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.265
You heard about that?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.234
Yeah.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.804
Carter likes to talk.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.208
This isn't happening, okay?

29:02.241 --> 29:04.310
We're not friends.
We're not co-workers.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.946
We're barely even
acquaintances.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.881
So, don't think you can
take one look at me

29:08.915 --> 29:12.051
and come to any
sort of conclusion
about how I feel.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.320
But thanks for
the therapy session.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.888
Well played.

29:15.922 --> 29:16.989
Excuse me?

29:17.023 --> 29:19.058
This whole, uh,
icy wall thing.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.092
I mean, I know
it's your M.O.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.194
And you learned it
from the best.

29:22.228 --> 29:25.832
But to be honest,
it's getting
kind of annoying.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.199
It is, is it?

29:27.834 --> 29:28.901
Yeah.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.371
Fine.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.340
I care about Jeremy.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.942
You happy?

29:35.975 --> 29:36.976
Now go away.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.347
Look,
I understand where
you're coming from.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.149
Relationships
can be difficult.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.284
We're really gonna
do this, aren't we?

29:45.317 --> 29:46.352
Yeah. We are.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.559
I know what it's like
to put yourself out there

29:53.592 --> 29:54.626
for somebody
you really like

29:54.660 --> 29:57.196
and have it not come back
the way you were hoping.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.566
Are we still
talking about me?

30:00.599 --> 30:01.868
Or are we
talking about you now?

30:02.869 --> 30:03.669
Both.

30:05.037 --> 30:07.339
What happened
between the two of you?

30:07.373 --> 30:08.841
Why didn't it work out?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.210
Simple.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.947
He never really let me
into his life.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.248
His real life.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.885
I know how that feels.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.388
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

30:28.294 --> 30:30.396
Hey. So, how's it going?

30:30.429 --> 30:32.398
Well, it's not great.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.100
Oh, it's not?

30:34.133 --> 30:38.037
No. It's amazing.

30:38.070 --> 30:41.440
I mean,
I'll be surprised if somebody
doesn't call the cops, Jane.

30:42.909 --> 30:43.943
It's that good?

30:44.443 --> 30:46.178
It's better.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.449
Coming through.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.187
What's up?
You guys, get a room.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.289
Actually. Just chill.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.961
Oh, I wasn't gonna
say anything, Jane,
but, uh,

31:01.994 --> 31:05.397
good news is
you're throwing the party
of the century.

31:05.431 --> 31:06.899
And I'm not even there.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.368
That's okay.

31:09.401 --> 31:12.638
Have a good time.
But make sure nothing

in the closet.

Hey, Billy.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.125
Awesome party.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.994
Caitlyn, I thought
you'd be at Harper's?

31:35.027 --> 31:36.195
Are you kidding me?

31:36.228 --> 31:38.230
Harper isn't
even at Harper's.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.120
What's up, baby?

32:03.255 --> 32:04.256
Yeah.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.396
What up, man?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.231
Glad yMe, too. bro.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.967
Hey, I thought you said
this was gonna tank.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.702
No, no, no.
You said it was
gonna tank.

32:16.735 --> 32:17.970
That's true.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.939
All right. Listen, bro.
Can I talk to you
real quick, man?

32:22.274 --> 32:24.310
Look, I probably should've
said this last week.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.978
But I just
wanted to apologize

32:26.012 --> 32:28.447
for the whole
play situation.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.118
I know you really loved it,
and I'm starting to understand
what that feels like.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.319
If you asked me
to quit backstage,

32:33.352 --> 32:34.987
I would've been
pretty upset, too.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.122
It's okay.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.357
No, no.
Actually, it's not.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.959
I shouldn't have let the past
mess with my head like that.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.364
So can you do
Yeah. Sure.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.000
Take up your rightful seat
on the throne.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.301
It meant a lot that
you'd step down,

32:49.335 --> 32:51.003
but I never should have
let you do it...

32:51.037 --> 32:51.937
No, man. It's not...

32:51.970 --> 32:54.306
Dude.
You're Nick Fadden.
All right?

you were born to play.

isn't that your costume?

Oh, uh, yeah.
Actually it...

33:05.184 --> 33:06.752
Hey, Nick.
How's it going?

33:06.785 --> 33:08.254
Great!

33:08.287 --> 33:10.456
Okay..

33:10.489 --> 33:12.291
Hi. I thought
you weren't coming.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.293
I wasn't. But,
I do have friends here

33:14.326 --> 33:16.395
and I wanted to come
say hi to them.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.297
How's your arm
by the way?

33:18.330 --> 33:21.267
I'm gonna stay
out of this.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.603
(CLEARS THROAT)

33:26.072 --> 33:27.773
So Nick and I talked.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.775
I told him that
he needs to
re-join the play.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.343
Great.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.045
Yeah.
So, are we okay now?

33:33.079 --> 33:34.213
You're unbelievable.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.482
You don't even care.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.350
You just told Nick
to rejoin the play

33:38.384 --> 33:39.485
so you could
wipe the slate

33:39.518 --> 33:40.786
and keep spending
the night here.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.421
Wipe the slate?
Zoe...

33:42.454 --> 33:43.855
You think that
you can just
apologize to Nick

33:43.889 --> 33:46.558
and suddenly I'll be
all cool with you spending
the night at Jane's?

33:46.592 --> 33:48.394
I'm sorry,
but it doesn't work
like that.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.795
Can we not
do this here?

33:49.828 --> 33:50.796
Oh, we're
doing this here.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.631
Okay, fine.
Just come with me.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.503
Hey, isn't this dress
so pretty?

What's going on?

34:06.545 --> 34:07.579
I'm upset.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.281
Yeah, I can tell.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.617
Look, Nick and I
straightened things out,
okay.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.186
I was being
weird and jealous
about you two...

34:14.220 --> 34:15.487
That's the thing, Billy.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.389
This isn't even
about me and Nick.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.158
What's it about?

34:19.191 --> 34:20.592
Me?.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.129
Yes.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.630
And the fact that
you can't move on.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.598
I have completely
moved on from Lulu.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.634
I'm not talking
about Lulu.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.170

you have with her,

naive, Jane.

I wouldn't compromise.

42:30.916 --> 42:34.886
Not creatively.
Not professionally.
And, look at me.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.756
Compromise is
all that I've done.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.826
In the end, Jane,
all you have is your word.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.093
Even if
it's only to yourself.

42:42.127 --> 42:43.995
And I want that back.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.064
But we can
get that back.

42:46.097 --> 42:50.902
I hope you know how
much your friendship
means to me, Jane.

42:50.936 --> 42:53.839
But I don't think
you understand what
I'm telling you.

42:54.873 --> 42:55.907
I'm done,

42:57.142 --> 42:58.944
Jane,

42:58.977 --> 43:00.011
with all of it.

43:04.883 --> 43:08.787
* Don't say anything

43:08.820 --> 43:11.657
* To make this moment

43:11.690 --> 43:13.191
* Never changing

43:14.926 --> 43:19.665
* So don't say anything
