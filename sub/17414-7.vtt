00:00.004 --> 00:01.632
Hi. I'm Chuck. Here's a few things

00:01.632 --> 00:02.385
that you might need to know.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.522 --> 01:34.595
Perfect.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.235
Casey, things are getting a little hairy in here.

01:40.812 --> 01:42.918
Please tell me the Intersect isn't busy.

01:44.183 --> 01:44.826
Busy?

01:44.881 --> 01:47.370
For you? Never.

01:48.223 --> 01:49.670
I want you to teach me, Chuck.

01:49.670 --> 01:50.730
Oh, really? Do you?

01:50.730 --> 01:52.693
Well, I assume that you're referring to the ancient art

01:52.693 --> 01:54.168
of Nerd Herding, but I must warn you,

01:54.168 --> 01:56.013
the road to computer enlightenment

01:56.013 --> 01:57.935
is a long and treacherous one.

01:57.935 --> 01:58.981
Bring it on.

01:59.299 --> 02:00.508
Speaking of,

02:00.529 --> 02:02.634
how about you bring me on your next install?

02:02.634 --> 02:03.797
Whoa, easy there.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.186
Before you can run, you must first learn to crawl,

02:06.186 --> 02:07.005
young grasshopper.

02:07.005 --> 02:09.537
Okay. Well, maybe you would prefer to go with Jeff, then.

02:09.537 --> 02:11.464
Just the two of you, cramped into that tiny,

02:11.464 --> 02:12.717
hot Nerd Herd mobile.

02:13.430 --> 02:14.489
Well played, newbie.

02:14.543 --> 02:16.076
Next assignment, you get to ride shotgun.

02:16.076 --> 02:16.854
Nice.

02:20.795 --> 02:22.087
Excuse me for just one second.

02:25.342 --> 02:26.352
What's going on? I'm in the middle of something here.

02:26.352 --> 02:27.982
- It's Shaw. It's bad.  - Can't it wait?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.668
No. Not unless you want him to suffocate to death.

02:29.668 --> 02:31.223
Suffocate to death? What are you talking about?

02:34.355 --> 02:35.224
'Sup, Hannah?

02:36.943 --> 02:37.819
Hey, just wanted to let you know,

02:37.819 --> 02:39.278
if you need anyone to show you around the, uh, Buy More...

02:39.278 --> 02:40.120
Who is that?

02:40.620 --> 02:42.315
Super hot blonde, heart of ice?

02:42.315 --> 02:43.835
Yeah, that's Chuck's ex, Sarah.

02:45.027 --> 02:46.041
What's their deal?

02:46.096 --> 02:49.610
Well, deal is Sarah dumped his ass and, uh, broke his heart.

02:49.622 --> 02:51.962
And now she can't resist coming back here to stomp on it.

02:51.962 --> 02:52.957
Look at my boy.

02:52.957 --> 02:54.453
Ah, poor sap.

02:55.733 --> 02:56.791
Everything all right, buddy?

02:56.791 --> 02:58.637
Yeah, got to run. Nerd Herd emergency.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.199
Right now? I didn't get the call and technically,

03:01.199 --> 03:03.188
all onsites should run through the assistant manager.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.680
I gu... Wait, where are you going?

03:05.680 --> 03:07.374
You heard the boss. Nerd Herd emergency.

03:08.005 --> 03:08.976
Ah, Carry on.

03:10.288 --> 03:11.759
Wait a minute. I'm the boss.

03:29.852 --> 03:31.042
Hey. Hey. Took you long enough.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.395
Yeah, good to see you, too.

03:32.395 --> 03:33.645
You mind telling me what Shaw's doing

03:33.645 --> 03:34.664
breaking into a museum vault?

03:34.664 --> 03:36.485
Forget it. He's only got five minutes of air left.

03:36.485 --> 03:37.469
Fine. What am I doing?

03:37.601 --> 03:39.858
Getting on the museum's server, rebooting the system,

03:39.858 --> 03:41.912
and opening the vault door before Shaw gets snuffed.

03:41.912 --> 03:43.352
They're never going to let me on their server, Casey.

03:43.352 --> 03:44.914
Well, I took the liberty of crashing it.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.157
It was the only way to stop the alarm.

03:46.157 --> 03:47.775
Unless you get on that server, there's no way

03:47.775 --> 03:49.874
to open the vault door. Now get in there, Bartowski.

03:51.758 --> 03:54.019
Oh, you're here. Thank heavens someone called you.

03:54.019 --> 03:55.221
Yeah, uh, what seems to be the problem?

03:55.221 --> 03:57.070
I'm the curator of Classical Art.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.529
I've never even touched one of these machines in my life.

03:59.529 --> 04:02.253
All I know is the museum went into full lockdown mode.

04:02.253 --> 04:04.305
It's designed to protect the collections from fire,

04:04.305 --> 04:06.260
but unless you fix it, there's no way to control

04:06.260 --> 04:08.510
the temperature or-or the humidity.

04:08.535 --> 04:10.904
CURATOR : Some of these pieces are extremely sensitive.

04:10.904 --> 04:12.216
So am I, Chuck.

04:13.850 --> 04:16.207
CASEY : Chuck, we're in the crawl space above the vault.

04:16.207 --> 04:17.563
We're trying to get the door open.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.596
It's four inches of solid steel.

04:20.624 --> 04:21.986
We could try blowing the hatches.

04:21.986 --> 04:23.148
We'll have to use C4.

04:23.165 --> 04:24.837
No. Shaw's too close. You're going to kill him.

04:27.182 --> 04:28.067
It's up to you, Chuck.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.434
You've got to get this door open.

04:29.495 --> 04:32.141
Some of these artifacts are over 3,000 years old.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.281
To have survive that long and then to be ruined

04:34.281 --> 04:36.791
by some stupid computer system.

04:36.791 --> 04:38.248
You know, if you don't mind,

04:38.248 --> 04:40.240
I could really use a little breathing room.

04:41.577 --> 04:43.234
That's right. Step aside.

04:43.253 --> 04:44.671
We are the professionals.

04:45.809 --> 04:46.885
Hannah, what are you doing here?

04:46.885 --> 04:49.470
Surprise. I saw your Nerd Herder parked outside the museum.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.042
And you said that I could ride shotgun.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.612
So, what's the problem?

04:53.374 --> 04:54.640
Get rid of her, Chuck.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.227
Shaw's got less than a minute.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.409
Look, I don't care which of you it is,

05:01.409 --> 05:02.879
but please do something.

05:03.793 --> 05:06.034
Have you ever restarted a server from the backup database?

05:06.034 --> 05:07.501
Oh, now you're just insulting me.

05:07.501 --> 05:08.551
Show me what you got.

05:10.993 --> 05:12.715
Run the context script off server one.

05:12.866 --> 05:14.471
Ó²

05:15.947 --> 05:17.365
Validated. Next?

05:17.312 --> 05:18.788
Ó²

05:19.653 --> 05:21.067
Just blow the hatch.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.167
Blow the hatch.

05:25.290 --> 05:26.402
What about the mask?

05:26.601 --> 05:27.828
I'm dying.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.330
Roger that.

05:33.242 --> 05:34.316
Ó²

05:36.425 --> 05:37.126
Fire in the hole.

05:37.126 --> 05:38.034
No, don't!

05:40.398 --> 05:42.033
Don't, computer. Don't do...

05:42.033 --> 05:43.576
I'm just talking to the computer.

05:43.597 --> 05:46.026
Cause sometimes, I feel like it helps. Ha.

05:46.858 --> 05:48.574
I need you to reboot on the count of three.

05:48.635 --> 05:50.045
One, two...

05:50.876 --> 05:53.471
Ó²

05:53.471 --> 05:54.560
Ó²!

05:58.067 --> 05:59.108
Oh, my God. We did it!

05:59.108 --> 06:00.537
We did it! Hi!

06:08.703 --> 06:09.503
We did it!

06:11.726 --> 06:13.530
Not bad for your first mission.

06:13.530 --> 06:15.660
Splendid work, absolutely top notch.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.684
Really, I mean, I can't thank you enough.

06:17.684 --> 06:19.022
Well, you know, hey. Any time.

06:19.077 --> 06:21.577
- Oh, all right. Um, how about tomorrow night?  - What?

06:21.577 --> 06:24.581
Well, it's the unveiling of the Mask of Alexander.

06:24.581 --> 06:26.216
Everyone in the art world's going to be there,

06:26.216 --> 06:28.269
and I'd like you to be also.

06:28.269 --> 06:29.687
Not that I don't appreciate the invitation...

06:29.687 --> 06:32.960
Oh, no, no. I'm not inviting you. I'm hiring you.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.915
I want you there to ensure that, well, there's no more,

06:36.286 --> 06:37.864
uh, what do you call them?

06:38.340 --> 06:39.265
Bugs.

06:39.498 --> 06:40.691
Take the job, Chuck.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.954
You and your new partner are going to help us

06:42.954 --> 06:44.336
steal the Mask of Alexander.

06:45.593 --> 06:47.401
So, what do you say, partner?

06:50.024 --> 06:51.053
It's a date.

06:52.819 --> 06:54.656
Magnificent. Isn't it?

07:42.257 --> 07:42.857
What is that?

07:42.857 --> 07:45.168
Double shot Americano. No cream, no sugar.

07:45.222 --> 07:46.403
Just the way you like it.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.414
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:51.086 --> 07:53.634
I noticed you like to chew them when you get nervous.

07:57.943 --> 07:58.799
Hey, gang.

08:01.308 --> 08:03.124
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

08:03.143 --> 08:04.336
Thanks for joining us, gentlemen.

08:04.391 --> 08:06.137
I'm sure you've all guessed that the CIA

08:06.137 --> 08:08.608
is not interested in stealing the Mask of Alexander.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.109
We believe that this artifact

08:10.109 --> 08:11.217
and possibly others,

08:11.217 --> 08:13.344
are being used to smuggle items through Customs.

08:13.344 --> 08:14.627
What sort of items?

08:14.681 --> 08:16.248
Items of interest to the Ring.

08:16.649 --> 08:18.260
This was three months ago

08:18.260 --> 08:19.966
at the National Museum of Damascus.

08:20.586 --> 08:22.992
A team broke in, but didn't take anything.

08:22.992 --> 08:24.562
You think the Ring broke in just

08:24.562 --> 08:25.524
to hide something inside the mask?

08:25.524 --> 08:27.107
That's pretty smart. Traveling exhibitions

08:27.107 --> 08:28.381
don't have to go through normal screening.

08:28.381 --> 08:30.118
All I know is that we have to secure the mask

08:30.118 --> 08:31.199
before the Ring does.

08:31.199 --> 08:33.099
Chuck, you'll be in the museum's control room

08:33.099 --> 08:34.193
in case we have any other snags.

08:34.193 --> 08:36.149
Casey, you'll handle surveillance.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.895
Sarah, you and I will pose as guests at the party.

08:44.303 --> 08:45.027
We'll break in

08:45.027 --> 08:47.710
and swap the mask, before the unveiling with this reproduction.

08:47.710 --> 08:49.729
Any questions? Concerns?

08:49.729 --> 08:52.371
You mean other than us bringing a civilian on the mission?

08:52.371 --> 08:54.487
I do have some new tranq darts I'd like to try out.

08:54.487 --> 08:56.312
No, no. I can handle Hannah.

08:56.312 --> 08:58.476
Besides, she can cover for me in my Nerd Herd duties

08:58.476 --> 09:00.838
in case you guys need to call in the big guns.

09:02.256 --> 09:03.597
And that would... that would be me.

09:03.597 --> 09:04.513
×Ö
When I say "Big guns,"

09:04.513 --> 09:06.285
Ä»
I'm referring to the Intersect, to myself.

09:06.285 --> 09:07.517
You know, if I need to flash.

09:07.517 --> 09:08.571
Glad we had this talk.

09:17.051 --> 09:17.942
Morgan. Hey.

09:19.650 --> 09:21.807
Chuck would freak if he knew we were meeting like this.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.329
Morgan, you told me

09:25.329 --> 09:27.374
that Jeff and Lester would get to the bottom of Chuck's secret.

09:27.374 --> 09:29.534
I may have overstated their abilities at bit.

09:29.972 --> 09:31.163
What I can tell you

09:31.163 --> 09:34.659
is that Chuck is hardly ever at work.

09:34.659 --> 09:37.283
Always ducking in and out on, uh, weird Nerd Herd calls.

09:37.283 --> 09:39.233
Yeah. Like his mysterious trip to Paris.

09:39.233 --> 09:40.755
He's been acting weird ever since.

09:41.061 --> 09:42.555
Right. You want to know what I think?

09:42.555 --> 09:43.742
- Not really.  - All right.

09:43.742 --> 09:45.120
I think Chuck's protecting us.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.354
Protect us from what?

09:46.354 --> 09:48.391
I don't think he wants us to know that he's gone to the

09:48.758 --> 09:49.771
dark place.

09:50.944 --> 09:51.859
Oh, you don't mean...

09:51.859 --> 09:53.852
Yeah. Junior year. When Jill dumped him.

09:53.852 --> 09:56.384
Sat in his room and played GoldenEye for what, three months?

09:57.072 --> 09:58.824
Who knew you could get bedsores from playing video games?

09:59.144 --> 10:00.449
This makes total sense.

10:00.953 --> 10:02.940
This time, Sarah breaks Chuck's heart,

10:02.940 --> 10:04.740
sends Chuck into an emotional tailspin.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.761
Oh, let's not panic. Let's not panic.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.572
I'll-I'll see what I can find out, you know?

10:08.572 --> 10:09.271
How?

10:09.725 --> 10:11.547
I'm the assistant manager at the Buy More, okay?

10:11.869 --> 10:13.128
I have my methods.

10:13.128 --> 10:15.387
All right, Let's see here. Phillips head screwdriver set?

10:15.387 --> 10:16.026
Check.

10:16.622 --> 10:17.585
Dummy artifact?

10:17.891 --> 10:18.544
×Ö
Check.

10:18.736 --> 10:19.546
Ä»
Harnesses?

10:19.546 --> 10:20.153
×Ö
Check.

10:20.510 --> 10:22.445
Ä»
And needle-nose pliers.

10:22.445 --> 10:23.327
×Ö
Check.

10:23.327 --> 10:24.457
Ä»
Descender line.

10:26.379 --> 10:27.247
Check.

10:27.305 --> 10:28.419
Fantastic.

10:29.202 --> 10:29.924
Well...

10:30.653 --> 10:33.519
Lock and load.

10:35.079 --> 10:36.230
You ready, Agent Walker?

10:36.783 --> 10:37.999
Of course I'm ready.

10:38.897 --> 10:41.000
It's just, this is our first mission

10:41.000 --> 10:42.330
in the field, so...

10:42.851 --> 10:44.960
I want to make sure that we're both on the same page.

10:46.429 --> 10:48.877
So, you ready for your first mission, Hannah?

10:48.877 --> 10:49.730
Mission?

10:49.784 --> 10:51.791
Well, I'm just trying to say that,

10:51.791 --> 10:54.490
you know, you never know what's going to happen out there

10:54.490 --> 10:56.032
outside the protection of the Buy More.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.940
You and me, we're... we're going behind enemy lines.

10:59.434 --> 11:00.230
×Ö
Okay.

11:00.230 --> 11:01.374
Ä»
SHAW: You know, maybe we should talk about

11:01.374 --> 11:02.639
how many dates we've been on.

11:03.039 --> 11:04.815
You know, we are playing a couple tonight, so...

11:05.412 --> 11:07.557
What do you think? Uh, one, two?

11:07.557 --> 11:08.450
Five?

11:09.105 --> 11:10.733
Does it really make a difference?

11:11.301 --> 11:12.588
It informs our cover.

11:12.854 --> 11:14.598
Our chemistry, body language.

11:14.898 --> 11:16.933
For instance, have we slept together yet?

11:18.216 --> 11:19.120
You got to be kidding me.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.651
No, it changes the whole dynamic.

11:21.392 --> 11:22.554
Well, in that case, no,

11:22.554 --> 11:24.582
we definitely have not slept together.

11:26.106 --> 11:27.031
Good to know.

11:44.440 --> 11:46.780
All right, well, uh, make yourselves comfortable.

11:46.780 --> 11:48.247
I trust I shan't be seeing

11:48.247 --> 11:49.809
either of you two again this evening.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.823
The vault is scheduled to open at precisely 8:00.

11:52.990 --> 11:54.787
The unveiling must go off without a hitch.

11:54.787 --> 11:57.358
No more bugs, no more crashes, no more...

11:57.358 --> 11:58.219
No problem.

11:59.125 --> 11:59.992
Problems.

12:04.363 --> 12:05.610
The mask is in this vault.

12:05.610 --> 12:06.714
It opens at 8:00.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.525
Doesn't give us much time to make the swap.

12:10.239 --> 12:12.722
I thought I made myself clear about our cover.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.084
Just because we haven't slept together

12:15.510 --> 12:16.355
doesn't mean we have to act

12:16.355 --> 12:17.963
like this is a middle school dance.

12:19.744 --> 12:22.263
Over there, behind that door,

12:22.869 --> 12:25.281
is a staircase that leads up to the top of the vault.

12:27.172 --> 12:29.080
Keep an eye out on the security cameras

12:29.718 --> 12:30.735
up to your right

12:31.641 --> 12:32.758
and straight ahead.

12:35.311 --> 12:36.629
Are we good, Agent Walker?

12:36.785 --> 12:38.230
Yes, we're fine.

12:38.262 --> 12:39.127
Thank you.

12:41.951 --> 12:43.938
Man, it really is impressive--

12:43.938 --> 12:46.319
the size of Alexander's empire.

12:46.319 --> 12:47.243
You know what I mean?

12:47.243 --> 12:49.060
Can you keep a secret, Chuck?

12:49.765 --> 12:51.122
Huh? Uh... uh...

12:51.522 --> 12:53.973
Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, kind of my forte.

12:54.739 --> 12:57.712
Do you want to know the real reason that I took this job?

12:58.967 --> 13:01.626
Um... was it the snazzy outfits?

13:01.626 --> 13:04.354
No, it was the barely livable wage.

13:04.755 --> 13:05.592
You.

13:07.857 --> 13:10.379
Uh... me-me? Really, me?

13:10.571 --> 13:13.133
It's not like I haven't been giving you signals.

13:14.883 --> 13:16.599
I hope this isn't too forward.

13:18.461 --> 13:19.133
No.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.308
No, forward is good.

13:21.123 --> 13:22.096
In that case...

13:42.349 --> 13:44.072
What did I do? What did I... is there something wrong?

13:44.072 --> 13:45.858
You and your ex-girlfriend...

13:46.932 --> 13:48.435
Yeah, what? Who? Sarah?

13:48.435 --> 13:50.453
Yeah. Morgan said that you guys were done.

13:50.802 --> 13:52.342
100% done-zo. Why?

13:53.219 --> 13:55.452
That is her, right?

13:58.266 --> 14:00.299
Any idea what she's doing here?

14:01.336 --> 14:03.282
Other than making you jealous

14:03.282 --> 14:06.739
with that ridiculously good-looking date of hers.

14:06.749 --> 14:09.459
R-ridiculously good... Him? Him? Nah.

14:09.459 --> 14:10.902
Yeah, if you're into the...

14:11.621 --> 14:13.334
the strong, kind of Superman-y

14:13.334 --> 14:14.208
type of a guy.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.176
Ó² Ó²2

14:24.038 --> 14:26.298
Um, I am going to be right back.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.629
Chuck, what are you doing here?

14:35.629 --> 14:37.562
The Ring agent who broke into the museum

14:37.562 --> 14:40.132
in Damascus, Vasillis, is here,

14:40.132 --> 14:41.158
and when I say "Here,"

14:41.158 --> 14:43.095
I mean in the same room, here.

14:43.348 --> 14:45.800
Look over there.

14:50.482 --> 14:51.559
We have to abort.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.390
We don't have a choice.

14:54.463 --> 14:56.135
Vasillis and I have a history.

14:56.171 --> 14:57.905
Are you sure he remembers you?

14:58.921 --> 15:01.392
You tend to remember the guy who set your face on fire.

15:04.456 --> 15:07.119
Uh, yeah, looks like your friend isn't alone, either.

15:09.089 --> 15:09.966
They're casing the place.

15:09.966 --> 15:11.203
They're here to grab the mask.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.474
We better move right now.

15:13.338 --> 15:14.411
I'm not sending you in alone.

15:14.411 --> 15:16.126
Hey, it's okay. No problem. I'll go with her.

15:16.126 --> 15:17.385
You don't know what you're dealing with.

15:24.054 --> 15:26.039
Get out of here, Shaw, unless you want to blow the cover.

15:26.039 --> 15:27.630
Chuck and I can handle the mask.

15:29.183 --> 15:30.007
All right.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.388
Casey and I will be in the van if you need us.

15:36.153 --> 15:38.221
Well, what do you say, partner?

15:39.077 --> 15:39.913
Let's go.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.792
Watch those security cameras.

15:48.792 --> 15:51.118
We have to assume the Ring has tapped into those, as well.

15:51.438 --> 15:53.389
Yeah, I'm, uh, one step ahead of you.

15:53.426 --> 15:54.448
Sorry, Hannah.

15:53.438 --> 15:54.512
{\an8}Ó²

15:56.030 --> 15:57.924
{\an8}Ó²1

15:57.382 --> 15:59.384
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:08.399 --> 16:09.676
What's that beeping noise?

16:09.676 --> 16:11.479
Uh... and where's your partner?

16:11.532 --> 16:12.697
Um, he's, uh...

16:14.769 --> 16:15.938
Actually, I don't know.

16:15.938 --> 16:17.982
Look, people have traveled from all over the world

16:17.982 --> 16:19.019
to be here tonight.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.702
Now, I don't care what's going on,

16:20.702 --> 16:22.232
just fix it.

16:22.312 --> 16:24.765
You have five minutes until the grand unveiling.

16:25.289 --> 16:26.839
Now, go!

16:32.226 --> 16:33.678
Okay, you're going to have to lower me

16:33.678 --> 16:35.116
into the vault by hand.

16:35.457 --> 16:36.109
Here.

16:36.643 --> 16:37.348
So...

16:37.674 --> 16:38.611
you and Shaw looked like

16:38.611 --> 16:40.365
you were having fun at the party tonight.

16:40.365 --> 16:41.510
What's that supposed to mean?

16:41.510 --> 16:42.310
I'm just saying--

16:42.310 --> 16:43.745
you two make a cute couple.

16:44.668 --> 16:46.684
SARAH : Shaw and I are playing a cover.

16:47.633 --> 16:48.420
Whatever.

16:49.108 --> 16:49.823
But the guy's a...

16:50.646 --> 16:52.584
Walker and Bartowski turn off their mics for some reason?

16:52.584 --> 16:53.473
No, I did.

16:53.528 --> 16:55.208
Those two gab like little schoolgirls

16:55.208 --> 16:57.057
when they're out in the field. It's murder on the ears.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.192
×Ö
That's ridiculous.

16:58.192 --> 16:59.300
Ä»
Ridiculous?

16:59.300 --> 17:01.259
He couldn't keep his hands off of you all night.

17:01.259 --> 17:02.790
And the way he brings you coffee every morning?

17:04.786 --> 17:05.608
Seriously?

17:05.608 --> 17:07.349
You don't see the... you got to be blind.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.186
You're one to talk.

17:10.317 --> 17:11.217
Well, what is that supposed to mean?

17:11.217 --> 17:12.683
Oh, nothing. It's just that,

17:12.683 --> 17:14.250
ever since Hannah showed up at the Buy More,

17:14.250 --> 17:16.291
she hasn't been able to keep her hands off you.

17:16.291 --> 17:17.070
Cut the girl a break.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.541
You guys are cute together.

17:19.008 --> 17:21.270
Hannah and I are colleagues.

17:21.785 --> 17:24.970
Forgive me for trying to be professional.

17:24.970 --> 17:26.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.108
I didn't realize professional meant

17:27.108 --> 17:29.411
having her perfume lathered all over you.

17:31.028 --> 17:32.764
Come on. We got a mask to steal.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.448
Sir, we're ready.

17:45.909 --> 17:47.245
Vasillis sent his men into the vault.

17:47.245 --> 17:48.274
They must have the code.

17:48.512 --> 17:49.694
Walker, you've got company.

17:51.588 --> 17:52.601
Bartowski, you copy?

17:52.601 --> 17:53.335
Incoming.

17:53.335 --> 17:54.904
My hands are kind of full here.

18:00.338 --> 18:01.003
Hi there.

18:04.326 --> 18:05.602
- Sarah.  - Chuck.

18:14.979 --> 18:16.346
Hang on, Chuck. I got you.

18:17.409 --> 18:18.075
Okay.

18:24.057 --> 18:26.317
Ó²

18:26.672 --> 18:27.853
It's five past 8:00.

18:27.853 --> 18:29.282
Why isn't the vault opening?

18:29.362 --> 18:30.866
Keep your shirt on. Almost there.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.204
Almost there.

18:43.454 --> 18:44.192
Yes!

18:46.151 --> 18:48.091
Bartowski, I thought you took care of the vault.

18:48.643 --> 18:49.630
It's the girl, Hannah.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.771
She must be using Bartowski's laptop.

18:52.093 --> 18:53.267
We still tapped in remotely?

18:53.596 --> 18:54.102
Go.

18:54.102 --> 18:55.936
Opening the vault right now.

18:56.346 --> 18:57.435
Thank you so much.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.084
{\an8}Ó²

19:04.138 --> 19:05.085
No, no.

19:05.085 --> 19:07.634
Why is this happening? Why is this happening?

19:31.535 --> 19:32.326
Chuck.

19:33.758 --> 19:34.842
×Ö
I got it, I got it!

19:34.842 --> 19:35.549
Ä»
Chuck.

19:48.757 --> 19:49.378
{\an8}Ó²

19:49.106 --> 19:50.257
She broke the connection.

19:52.853 --> 19:54.209
Go, go, go, go!

19:59.745 --> 20:00.446
Clear! Clear!

20:00.446 --> 20:01.445
We're clear.

20:11.632 --> 20:12.534
Ta-da.

20:23.652 --> 20:25.306
Hey. I'll meet you back at Castle.

20:25.306 --> 20:26.495
Just give me a few minutes to pack up

20:26.495 --> 20:27.786
and smooth things over with Hannah.

20:27.786 --> 20:28.522
Bye.

20:31.966 --> 20:33.553
Hey, Hannah. Sorry about that.

20:35.792 --> 20:36.963
Where the hell have you been?

20:37.957 --> 20:39.584
How could you abandon me like that

20:39.584 --> 20:41.801
on my first Nerd Herd assignment?

20:43.046 --> 20:44.442
Forget it. I know where you were.

20:44.971 --> 20:45.920
You do?

20:47.198 --> 20:48.060
Yes.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.136
I saw you with your ex-girlfriend.

20:52.135 --> 20:53.705
Why would you tell me that things were over

20:53.705 --> 20:55.785
between you when they're clearly not?

20:56.645 --> 20:58.400
It's... it just... it's not what you think.

20:59.346 --> 21:00.931
Okay. Then, what is it?

21:01.366 --> 21:03.349
Sarah and I have a very...

21:04.207 --> 21:06.458
unique relationship.

21:06.964 --> 21:07.806
Wow.

21:08.175 --> 21:09.846
That sounds really special.

21:13.206 --> 21:17.331
I... I cannot believe that I made such an ass out of myself,

21:17.331 --> 21:18.379
kissing you like that.

21:18.379 --> 21:20.579
No, no! You didn't make an ass out of yourself. I'm... I'm the ass.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.599
Yes, clearly.

21:22.544 --> 21:24.118
I think we should just keep things professional

21:24.118 --> 21:25.163
between us from now on.

21:25.163 --> 21:27.336
No, Hannah, let... let me make it up to you.

21:28.309 --> 21:30.544
Forget it. Chuck, don't bother.

21:32.153 --> 21:33.427
I'll see you at work.

21:35.746 --> 21:36.793
???

21:48.956 --> 21:50.386
That's, like, six knocks short.

21:50.386 --> 21:51.538
: I don't know the knock.

21:51.772 --> 21:52.731
Can I come in?

21:52.731 --> 21:54.178
Yes, yes, he's asleep.

21:54.248 --> 21:56.065
He didn't get home till God knows when

21:56.065 --> 21:57.836
after doing God knows what.

21:58.228 --> 21:59.624
Wait, I thought he was at work.

21:59.624 --> 22:00.773
Yeah, so did I

22:00.773 --> 22:02.587
till I got a pissed off call from the museum.

22:02.587 --> 22:05.221
Chuck bailed on a Nerd Herd and left his partner behind.

22:05.665 --> 22:06.889
Does that sound familiar?

22:07.292 --> 22:08.999
That's great. So now we're back at square one.

22:08.999 --> 22:09.887
Not necessarily.

22:10.113 --> 22:11.338
I had an epiphany last night.

22:11.561 --> 22:12.177
×Ö
What's that?

22:12.177 --> 22:14.349
Ä» ×Ö
It's a sudden, intuitive realization. I looked it up.

22:14.349 --> 22:15.653
Ä»
I know what an epiphany is, Morgan.

22:15.653 --> 22:17.374
I'm asking what epiphany you had.

22:17.374 --> 22:19.233
Ah, right, well, I think

22:19.233 --> 22:20.899
that we might be going about this all wrong. Okay,

22:20.899 --> 22:23.398
let's just sit Chuck down and have an intervention,

22:23.398 --> 22:24.621
force him to be honest with us.

22:24.621 --> 22:26.053
It's the only way to get to the bottom of this.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.209
CHUCK: Get to the bottom of what?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.599
Nothing, probably my breakfast.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.960
No, what? Good morning.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.864
Hi, morning. Morning, Ellie.

22:38.007 --> 22:39.513
Okay, well, we're going to be late for work.

22:40.201 --> 22:41.390
Oh, look at that.

22:41.513 --> 22:42.971
??? My goodness. : You...???

22:43.197 --> 22:45.113
: We can't do this right now. What are you talking about?

22:45.113 --> 22:46.456
You just said "Intervention."

22:47.232 --> 22:48.233
What is wrong with you?

22:48.233 --> 22:49.360
You are a coward.

22:58.754 --> 23:00.683
That's who stole my mask.

23:06.014 --> 23:07.021
Pause it.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.095
Who is she?

23:11.709 --> 23:12.963
Oh, he's good.

23:13.386 --> 23:15.108
A real Casanova, this one.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.578
He used the blonde to get into the vault

23:18.578 --> 23:22.059
and seduced the computer girl to access the security system.

23:23.298 --> 23:26.630
It's time to see how coldhearted

23:26.630 --> 23:28.693
our thief really is.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.306
Tough night at the museum?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.114
Curator called me and gave me an earful.

23:38.114 --> 23:39.881
Oh, really? What did he say?

23:39.900 --> 23:41.325
You know, I don't really know.

23:41.352 --> 23:44.020
I have a hard time making out British accents, you know.

23:44.020 --> 23:44.931
To me, it's just

23:44.931 --> 23:46.533
"Oi, blighty this."

23:46.664 --> 23:48.700
You know, it kind of just reminds me of Mrs. Doubtfire,

23:49.174 --> 23:50.545
which is an awesome flick.

23:51.873 --> 23:53.308
So what did happen last night?

23:53.688 --> 23:56.139
Well, you know, I-I don't want to point any fingers...

23:56.139 --> 23:56.963
Don't snitch--

23:56.963 --> 23:57.941
code of the streets.

23:59.008 --> 24:00.225
What are you talking about?

24:00.279 --> 24:01.655
Well, your loyalty to Chuck.

24:01.655 --> 24:03.606
You know, I get it-- you want to protect your boss,

24:03.606 --> 24:04.311
but here's the thing.

24:04.311 --> 24:06.395
I'm his boss is what I'm saying.

24:06.876 --> 24:08.798
Actually, I don't want you to think of me as your boss' boss.

24:08.798 --> 24:10.215
I'd rather you think of me as a friend

24:10.673 --> 24:11.943
ultimately, you know,

24:11.943 --> 24:13.831
and a friend you can tell anything to.

24:16.182 --> 24:17.376
And I do mean anything.

24:21.079 --> 24:21.937
Excuse me.

24:23.248 --> 24:24.205
Hello. Nerd Herd.

24:24.262 --> 24:25.910
I'm calling from the museum.

24:26.489 --> 24:27.659
Another doofus with an accent.

24:27.659 --> 24:28.769
Can you believe this?

24:29.835 --> 24:30.689
How may I help you?

24:30.689 --> 24:33.509
We are still having problems with our computer system.

24:33.999 --> 24:36.337
Perhaps you can send the girl you sent last night.

24:36.337 --> 24:37.713
Uh, you must mean Hannah.

24:38.154 --> 24:39.146
Right.

24:40.982 --> 24:41.801
Hannah.

24:41.801 --> 24:44.045
Absolutely, I think she'd be happy to come back out,

24:44.045 --> 24:46.371
and in fact, to make up for the hiccup, it's on the house.

24:46.371 --> 24:47.848
I can even send her supervisor along.

24:47.848 --> 24:50.285
But I... cannot do that actually, um...

24:50.285 --> 24:51.439
He is busy.

24:51.439 --> 24:54.528
I'm sure she'll be able to handle the problem herself.

24:54.528 --> 24:55.928
She-she will indeed, absolutely.

24:56.368 --> 24:57.127
×Ö
Okay.

24:57.554 --> 24:59.942
Ä»
Thank you, morgan, you are a great friend.

25:01.131 --> 25:02.454
That's very sweet of you...

25:02.454 --> 25:05.745
and also very poignant because...

25:06.321 --> 25:08.052
I believe that that's a great place to start,

25:08.052 --> 25:10.310
you know, and then we can build from there.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.927
Oh, God.

25:16.787 --> 25:17.941
Good morning, Walker.

25:19.191 --> 25:20.930
Okay, we need to talk.

25:20.930 --> 25:22.675
About last night? About everything.

25:22.675 --> 25:24.304
About professional boundaries,

25:24.304 --> 25:25.462
about you bringing me coffee

25:25.462 --> 25:26.929
to work every morning and noticing

25:26.929 --> 25:29.208
that I like to chew on my swizzle sticks.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.663
You're embarrassing us both.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.065
We are just colleagues and that is

25:32.065 --> 25:33.226
all we are ever going to be,

25:33.226 --> 25:34.985
so please keep your coffee

25:35.181 --> 25:37.031
and your cheesy come-ons to yourself.

25:37.031 --> 25:38.219
Okay, you got that?

25:39.968 --> 25:42.896
Good, now let's get back to work.

25:42.896 --> 25:45.643
I feel like I should probably apologize to Colonel Casey.

25:46.432 --> 25:48.643
Hey, Shaw, thanks for the coffee.

25:48.643 --> 25:50.909
Just the way I like it-- black and bitter.

26:06.343 --> 26:07.253
Hello?

26:09.941 --> 26:11.286
Nerd Herd.

26:12.767 --> 26:14.303
Hi, someone called.

26:14.303 --> 26:17.189
Yes, thank you for coming.

26:17.905 --> 26:19.619
Where's the old curator?

26:19.619 --> 26:21.388
He's tied up.

26:21.388 --> 26:23.108
I'm the assistant curator.

26:23.108 --> 26:24.166
This way.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.641
We've been having problems

26:25.641 --> 26:27.778
with the security system in the vault,

26:27.778 --> 26:28.806
if you don't mind

26:28.806 --> 26:30.076
having a look.

26:30.076 --> 26:31.847
I really just fix computers.

26:31.847 --> 26:34.705
You seem like a smart girl.

26:34.705 --> 26:35.965
You'll figure it out.

26:36.787 --> 26:39.641
Oh, you don't happen to have a phone?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.514
No, I left it in the car.

26:41.514 --> 26:42.741
Don't worry.

26:51.681 --> 26:52.199
Hey.

26:53.406 --> 26:54.538
Hey!

27:02.996 --> 27:04.399
Nerd Herd. How can I help you?

27:04.399 --> 27:06.360
You can bring me my mask.

27:07.350 --> 27:09.015
Uh, I think you might have the wrong number, sir.

27:09.015 --> 27:10.293
Let me rephrase.

27:10.293 --> 27:13.863
Either you bring me the mask or I kill your girlfriend.

27:15.890 --> 27:19.150
Morgan, have, uh, have you seen Hannah?

27:19.555 --> 27:21.932
Yeah, she's out on a call-- something at the museum.

27:27.678 --> 27:30.273
Sir, first of all, I-I don't have a girlfriend,

27:30.273 --> 27:31.176
just for clarification's sake,

27:31.176 --> 27:32.745
and second, like I mentioned earlier,

27:32.745 --> 27:33.905
this is the Nerd Herd desk,

27:33.905 --> 27:35.218
so unless you have a computer-related...

27:35.218 --> 27:36.411
I know who you are.

27:36.411 --> 27:39.425
If you want to see the girl alive, you'll come to the museum

27:39.425 --> 27:40.857
and come alone.

27:40.857 --> 27:44.276
She runs out of air in 30 minutes.

27:44.276 --> 27:47.538
Bring me my mask.

27:51.092 --> 27:52.053
Hey, buddy.

27:52.053 --> 27:53.143
Uh, here we go.

27:53.143 --> 27:54.975
Chuck, I think we need to talk. Not a good time.

27:58.669 --> 28:00.089
You know what? I don't care anymore.

28:07.013 --> 28:09.861
Listen, I'm your best friend, dude, or at least I used to be,

28:09.861 --> 28:10.733
and I deserve to know what--

28:10.733 --> 28:11.709
no, I demand to know

28:11.709 --> 28:13.142
what the hell is going on with you lately.

28:15.489 --> 28:17.401
Chuck-- you got to be kidding me.

28:18.793 --> 28:20.829
Hmm, check the base.

28:27.944 --> 28:29.072
Ó²

28:30.305 --> 28:30.944
Chuck

28:31.221 --> 28:32.880
Sarah, I need the mask now.

28:32.880 --> 28:33.852
Vasillis knows we took it

28:33.852 --> 28:35.308
and he wants it back; he grabbed Hannah.

28:35.308 --> 28:36.533
I'm coming down the tunnel.

28:39.268 --> 28:40.367
That can't be good.

28:40.367 --> 28:41.746
Uh, Chuck, don't come in here; we think

28:41.746 --> 28:42.822
the mask is some kind of a...

28:48.628 --> 28:49.266
No.

29:07.447 --> 29:08.831
Oh, no.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.381
Guys, guys, it's poison.

29:10.381 --> 29:11.214
You think?

29:11.214 --> 29:13.170
It's a designer weapon developed for battlefield use,

29:13.170 --> 29:14.362
but th-there's a counteragent

29:14.362 --> 29:16.413
that can be taken up to 30 minutes after exposure.

29:16.413 --> 29:17.356
Or what?

29:18.278 --> 29:19.134
Look, don't worry.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.869
I'm gonna get the counteragent from Vasillis.

29:20.869 --> 29:22.001
He wouldn't have shipped the weapon without it.

29:22.001 --> 29:23.359
It's got to be back at the...

29:30.734 --> 29:34.068
Casey, gear up.ÌýÒë

29:40.798 --> 29:42.592
This is never gonna work. It'll work.

29:42.592 --> 29:43.266
Here.

29:47.479 --> 29:49.981
Okay... okay, fine.

29:49.981 --> 29:51.709
So let's say we're able to fool Vasillis

29:52.040 --> 29:53.746
with another fake mask and we save Hannah.

29:53.746 --> 29:54.807
That still doesn't solve the problem

29:54.807 --> 29:56.389
of how we convince him to give us the counteragent.

29:56.389 --> 29:57.472
What about Sarah and Shaw?

29:57.472 --> 29:59.427
Do we have enough time to save them, too?

30:02.060 --> 30:03.865
Wait, wait, I got it, I got it.

30:03.865 --> 30:04.862
We gas him.

30:04.862 --> 30:06.068
That's a great plan,

30:06.068 --> 30:08.062
except the chemical weapon's already been deployed.

30:08.062 --> 30:10.820
Yeah, but Vasillis doesn't know that.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.035
I got some smoke grenades in the back.

30:17.134 --> 30:19.870
Funny, I don't feel like I'm dying.

30:19.870 --> 30:21.593
Chuck will come through for us.

30:22.431 --> 30:23.766
In case he doesn't...

30:25.110 --> 30:27.641
I wanted to clear the air between us.

30:27.641 --> 30:29.571
It turns out I haven't been

30:29.571 --> 30:34.151
completely honest about, uh, the coffee

30:34.151 --> 30:36.607
and how I was acting at the museum.

30:38.058 --> 30:41.185
Truth is I was hitting on you.

30:43.793 --> 30:45.203
It was completely unprofessional

30:45.203 --> 30:47.579
and I apologize.

30:50.971 --> 30:52.703
I owe you an apology as well.

30:52.703 --> 30:54.290
I overreacted.

30:58.736 --> 31:02.906
The way you touched my neck at the party...

31:04.460 --> 31:06.965
I guess it was kind of nice.

31:08.119 --> 31:09.686
Really?

31:10.515 --> 31:11.592
Really.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.982
Well, then, I... I'm glad we had this talk.

31:17.383 --> 31:20.463
Yeah, me, too.

31:26.076 --> 31:27.518
The poison has been contained.

31:27.518 --> 31:28.913
The room has been cleared.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.659
We got to get you out of here.

31:49.191 --> 31:50.393
Stop there.

31:51.790 --> 31:53.978
Show me my mask.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.360
Show me my Nerd Herder.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.563
She's in the vault.

32:03.563 --> 32:05.236
Oh, look at the time.

32:05.236 --> 32:07.943
Air must be getting a little thin.

32:12.474 --> 32:14.230
If he doesn't open the door, I'm going to blow the vault.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.475
I can't promise she'll be okay.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.050
I did what you asked and I brought the mask.

32:17.050 --> 32:17.886
Now let her out.

32:17.886 --> 32:19.684
If it were up to me, sure.

32:19.684 --> 32:21.110
She would walk free.

32:21.110 --> 32:23.709
But the people you've stolen from,

32:23.709 --> 32:26.907
the Ring, they're not so forgiving.

32:26.907 --> 32:27.850
Do what you want to me

32:27.850 --> 32:29.855
but the girl had nothing to do with this.

32:29.855 --> 32:32.505
You're in no position to make demands.

32:32.505 --> 32:35.085
You gave up any leverage you might've had

32:35.623 --> 32:37.810
when you walked in with the mask.

32:37.810 --> 32:39.110
Not quite.

32:40.629 --> 32:42.903
I think we all know what's inside this mask.

32:42.903 --> 32:44.687
So either you open that door and let her out

32:45.207 --> 32:46.934
or I release the gas.

32:47.693 --> 32:49.119
I don't believe you.

32:49.727 --> 32:50.983
Well, that's too bad.

32:50.983 --> 32:51.963
You should've.

32:56.886 --> 32:58.985
You've killed us all.

32:58.985 --> 33:00.102
You idiot!

33:00.102 --> 33:01.556
Well, there's a counteragent, right? Where is it?

33:01.556 --> 33:03.066
It's in a vase.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.112
There's hundred of them.

33:05.112 --> 33:06.071
Which one?

33:06.071 --> 33:07.559
How am I supposed to know?

33:07.559 --> 33:09.262
I wasn't going to steal it personally.

33:09.262 --> 33:10.792
Oh, I see, and I'm the idiot?

33:15.612 --> 33:16.675
Come on, Chuck.

33:16.675 --> 33:18.471
One of these things is not like the others.

33:39.736 --> 33:41.283
Oh. Oh.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.820
Time's up, Chuck.

33:51.820 --> 33:52.777
No, Casey, wait!

33:52.777 --> 33:53.719
I found the counteragent.

33:53.719 --> 33:55.088
Meet me in the control room.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.438
When do I get to blow something up?

34:02.686 --> 34:04.026
Casey, here, here.

34:04.026 --> 34:05.241
How time we got left?

34:05.241 --> 34:06.140
Don't worry about that.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.930
You get her out of the vault.

34:08.831 --> 34:10.085
You don't have enough time, do you?

34:10.085 --> 34:12.024
Focus, Bartowski.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.351
Even if they are lost,

34:13.351 --> 34:14.827
we still have a civilian in there.

34:14.827 --> 34:16.088
Get her out of there!

34:34.116 --> 34:36.230
Come on, come on.

34:36.230 --> 34:37.150
Yes!

34:46.379 --> 34:48.328
Sarah? Shaw? What the...?

34:48.328 --> 34:49.597
Here's the counteragent.

34:50.367 --> 34:52.364
I'll go release the curator.

35:01.659 --> 35:02.847
You okay? Yeah.

35:02.847 --> 35:06.104
Yeah, thank you.

35:21.093 --> 35:24.024
Hannah? Hannah? Hannah?

35:24.535 --> 35:25.927
What happened? You, uh...

35:25.927 --> 35:28.562
you passed out and I think, uh,

35:28.562 --> 35:30.881
somehow you got trapped in the vault.

35:30.881 --> 35:31.904
Oh, my God.

35:32.587 --> 35:34.305
I could've died in here.

35:37.627 --> 35:39.270
You saved my life, Chuck.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.663
Well, I don't...

35:41.107 --> 35:42.163
Oh, hey.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.405
Hey, hey.

35:48.095 --> 35:49.699
Look, I know I was acting really weird

35:49.699 --> 35:51.277
the other night... Forget it.

36:12.614 --> 36:14.000
Nice work, everyone.

36:14.553 --> 36:15.316
And you--

36:15.316 --> 36:17.011
I owe you one, Bartowski. Oh, come on.

36:17.011 --> 36:19.952
Just 'cause I saved your life. Twice.

36:21.337 --> 36:22.654
Don't mention it.

36:22.654 --> 36:24.609
It wasn't just my life.

36:25.165 --> 36:25.896
Yeah.

36:25.896 --> 36:26.517
You also helped

36:26.517 --> 36:28.246
secure a rogue chemical weapon.

36:28.246 --> 36:29.207
Guys.

36:29.207 --> 36:31.877
Look, I appreciate a ticker tape parade

36:31.877 --> 36:33.040
just like the next guy,

36:33.040 --> 36:35.159
but, come on, I got a great team.

36:35.646 --> 36:38.439
And that brings us to our next point of business.

36:38.439 --> 36:39.700
Well, uh, Chuck,

36:39.700 --> 36:41.709
you're not going to have us forever.

36:42.001 --> 36:43.771
The Intersect was originally designed

36:43.771 --> 36:45.931
so that agents could work autonomously.

36:47.294 --> 36:48.890
We're your training wheels.

36:48.890 --> 36:50.143
And your performance tells me

36:50.143 --> 36:52.136
that it's about time for us to come off.

36:53.476 --> 36:56.264
Hope you're ready for your big boy bike, Bartowski.

36:58.739 --> 36:59.899
Huh.

37:05.950 --> 37:06.491
Hey.

37:07.509 --> 37:10.716
Uh, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

37:11.052 --> 37:13.416
Yeah. I mean, I guess I've gotten used to us being a team,

37:13.416 --> 37:15.742
you know. Well, we're not going anywhere yet.

37:16.361 --> 37:17.660
But Shaw's right.

37:17.660 --> 37:20.533
At some point I'm just going to be standing in your way,

37:20.533 --> 37:23.362
and not just professionally.

37:23.885 --> 37:24.764
Right.

37:26.532 --> 37:28.894
Are you sure you're okay with the whole Hannah thing?

37:28.894 --> 37:31.758
Oh, I should've have given you a hard time.

37:31.758 --> 37:33.288
She's great and...

37:34.715 --> 37:36.386
How do you think I feel about you and Shaw?

37:36.386 --> 37:38.931
I mean, you two are perfect together.

37:40.062 --> 37:41.496
It's disgusting.

37:41.496 --> 37:42.061
Oh.

37:42.061 --> 37:43.862
In-in-in a heartwarming

37:43.862 --> 37:44.868
kind of way.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.688
Look, all I know is the guy carried you

37:50.688 --> 37:52.132
out of Castle on his back

37:52.132 --> 37:53.558
while you were both dying.

37:55.088 --> 37:56.604
So, if I have to see you with someone else

37:56.604 --> 37:58.643
it might as well be a hero, right?

38:00.015 --> 38:00.788
What can I say?

38:00.788 --> 38:02.800
I have a type.

38:10.018 --> 38:11.775
I'll see you, Sarah.

38:12.395 --> 38:13.892
Bye, Chuck.

38:33.793 --> 38:35.309
Well done on the knock.

38:35.309 --> 38:36.239
Really? Yeah.

38:37.128 --> 38:37.793
Is Chuck here?

38:37.793 --> 38:39.510
Slinking around somewhere, yeah.

38:39.510 --> 38:40.870
Uh, you ready to do this?

38:41.178 --> 38:43.005
Time for an intervention.

38:47.524 --> 38:49.191
What is Chuck doing here so late?

38:49.572 --> 38:50.703
This is exactly the behavior

38:50.703 --> 38:51.980
I was talking about, Ellie, okay.

38:51.980 --> 38:52.875
Your brother--

38:52.875 --> 38:55.450
he is into something weird here.

38:55.464 --> 38:56.401
No, no...

38:59.211 --> 39:01.656
Cameras, cameras, cameras. Morgan, listen to me.

39:01.656 --> 39:03.079
Whatever is going on behind that door,

39:03.079 --> 39:04.750
we need to know about, okay?

39:05.839 --> 39:07.552
This is for Chuck.

39:08.356 --> 39:09.298
For Chuck.

39:09.585 --> 39:10.329
Yes. You go.

39:10.329 --> 39:11.825
You go. Okay, I will.

39:29.050 --> 39:30.580
: Oh, my God!

39:30.954 --> 39:32.711
Chuck has a secret girlfriend.

39:32.711 --> 39:34.430
This means he's moving on with his life,

39:34.430 --> 39:36.004
and he's not wallowing in self-pity,

39:36.004 --> 39:37.486
and playing video games.

39:37.821 --> 39:39.630
This is such a relief.

39:40.138 --> 39:42.152
Such a relief.

39:42.152 --> 39:43.184
Man.

39:56.241 --> 39:58.136
Okay, I'm going to head out.

39:58.732 --> 39:59.853
You two coming?

39:59.853 --> 40:02.171
Uh, no, I'm going to finish up in here.

40:02.171 --> 40:03.800
Yeah, I'm-I'm pretty buried, too.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.520
So...

40:06.523 --> 40:07.348
Ah.

41:22.048 --> 41:24.563
We both know how dangerous this is.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.087
Relax, Sarah.

41:27.981 --> 41:30.436
I'm the safest guy in the world.

41:44.220 --> 41:45.921
Are you sure it was him?

41:45.921 --> 41:49.409
I'd never mistake Daniel Shaw.

41:51.872 --> 41:54.592
What are you going to do to him?

41:55.363 --> 41:58.020
Same thing I'm going to do to you.
