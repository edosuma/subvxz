Hey Star. Looking sparkly.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.394

something missing in my life

cabinet again.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.966
Is it because he is friends
with the cereals?

01:07.968 --> 01:11.536
No, it was
just him eavesdropping
on you like a creep.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.772
How does one "drop the eaves"?

01:13.774 --> 01:17.142
It means, he was
