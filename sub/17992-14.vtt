Announcer: Previously on
"Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood"

00:04.204 --> 00:05.338
the reunion.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.773
{\an8}You want to talk about
you smashing Yung Berg?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.908
{\an8}No, that's not
smashing, that's my man.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.311
{\an8}Oh, really, that's your man,
after you ---- my man, bitch.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.113
{\an8}What's up, fake ass ho.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.081
{\an8}You're a prostitute,
choke on a ---- ho.

00:15.148 --> 00:15.782
{\an8}I'm a prostitute?

00:15.849 --> 00:16.883
{\an8}You're a prostitute.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.550
{\an8}Whose ---- was you
choking on last week?

00:17.617 --> 00:18.752
{\an8}Hold on.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.353
{\an8}You're the one who told
me she was an escort.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.088
{\an8}Bitch, don't you
---- address me.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.858
{\an8}I'll address
whoever the ---- I want.

00:24.924 --> 00:26.626
{\an8}Sit the ---- down.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.461
{\an8}You're a petty ass thief.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.397
{\an8}The only thing I stole was your
---- and I ain't even worn them.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.865
{\an8}I mean, she gave me some
----, I'm not going to lie.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.633
{\an8}You gave me all the
---- in the world.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.236
{\an8}All right.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.303
{\an8}Like I told you before,

00:37.370 --> 00:38.405
{\an8}I've been waiting to ----
you up, bitch.

00:38.471 --> 00:41.408
{\an8}And tonight on our
epic two-part reunion.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.742
{\an8}I had to let him know
that you and I had a

00:42.809 --> 00:43.877
{\an8}physical relationship before.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.311
{\an8}Oh, we had a
physical relationship?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.814
{\an8}Teairra gave me ----.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.316
{\an8}I did fall in love with somebody
else, but me and you broke up.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.085
{\an8}We broke up because I left you.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.020
{\an8}I'm going to show you what
a masterpiece looks like.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.555
{\an8}I have heels higher than
your self esteem, sit down.

00:55.622 --> 00:56.823
{\an8}Well, I'll pull it out.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.525
{\an8}Omari, stop.

00:58.591 --> 00:59.793
{\an8}Chill.

00:59.859 --> 01:01.795
{\an8}Uncle Fester, keep my
name out of your mouth.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.897
{\an8}Uncle Fester?

01:03.963 --> 01:04.831
{\an8}Shut the ---- up.

01:04.897 --> 01:05.565
{\an8}No, you shut the ---- up.

01:05.632 --> 01:06.699
{\an8}I got a real problem.

01:06.766 --> 01:07.867
{\an8}She sent me a screen
shot of Masika saying

01:07.934 --> 01:08.835
{\an8}Ray was flirting with her.

01:08.902 --> 01:09.969
{\an8}You let me finish.

01:10.036 --> 01:10.837
{\an8}You're a pathological liar.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.971
{\an8}Shut up, bitch.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.207
{\an8}I just want you to
knock her out one time.

01:14.274 --> 01:20.647
â™ª

01:20.713 --> 01:21.815
â™ª

01:21.881 --> 01:23.450
[applause]

01:23.516 --> 01:26.085
{\an5}Welcome to part two of "Love and
Hip Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.188
{\an5}I'm your host, Mona Scott-Young.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.924
And we are ready to
get this show started.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.260
Remember, we want to keep that
social media conversation going,

01:34.327 --> 01:39.766
so please continue to
use the #lhhreunion.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.936
Now, we're back here with
Nikki, Mally Mal and Masika.

01:43.002 --> 01:46.739
So, Mally, what exactly is your
relationship with Masika today?

01:46.806 --> 01:48.541
Masika, she cool, you
know what I'm saying.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.277
When she rocking with you,
she cool, she go hard for you.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.813
{\an5}Berg will see, when
this ---- is over.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.215
She about to call him all
kinds of names and ----.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.084
Berg, chill.

01:58.151 --> 01:59.552
Keep my ams out
your ---- mouth then.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.188
I mean, you got an issue, dude?

02:02.255 --> 02:03.056
We can address it right now.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.524
WE'll talk about it.

02:04.591 --> 02:05.725
What you mean, I got an
issue, keep my name out

02:05.792 --> 02:07.060
of your mouth, ----.

02:07.126 --> 02:08.595
I'm speaking real though.

02:08.661 --> 02:09.729
Uncle Fester.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.164
Uncle Fester, keep my
name out your mouth.

02:11.231 --> 02:12.665
When I see you.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.835
----, what's up?

02:15.902 --> 02:19.272
Come on, that's not
happening, Mally Mal.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.709
{\an5}Mally, they're
pushing your buttons.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.344
Get him, baby.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.247
Get out of here, bitch.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.983
This isn't about you now, Berg.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.986
So, Masika, you've made some
comments on social media

02:33.052 --> 02:35.421
about Mally's reasons
for pursuing you.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.422
What are those reasons?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.824
What do you say it was?

02:37.891 --> 02:40.360
{\an5}Well, I do think that he was
interested in hanging out

02:40.426 --> 02:42.295
{\an5}a little bit.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.565
{\an5}But I don't think he would have
went as hard as he did had

02:45.632 --> 02:48.001
I not told him the show
that I was filming.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.569
Then he started the I love
yous and the flowers

02:49.636 --> 02:51.404
and this and that.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.705
It sounded good.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.107
I thought he was a nice person.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.843
I thought everything he
was doing was genuine.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.312
So, maybe I'm a little
gullible for falling for that.

02:59.379 --> 03:02.415
I don't know what degree of that
was real or what degree of

03:02.482 --> 03:04.284
that was put me on the show.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.685
So, I don't know.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.554
{\an1}That's funny, Mona, because she
came to me and asked me to

03:07.620 --> 03:08.421
do a show.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.255
Never did.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.723
I said, "Cool."

03:10.790 --> 03:11.858
She said, "We'll come to Vegas,
we'll film in Vegas, we'll use

03:11.925 --> 03:13.560
our animal, use your
cars, do a photo shoot."

03:13.626 --> 03:15.361
I said, "It's cool, as long as
we keep it on a level,

03:15.428 --> 03:17.797
we're just dating, we're just
chilling, it's nothing serious,

03:17.864 --> 03:19.399
we can rock with it."

03:19.465 --> 03:20.733
I wasn't trying to be a cast
member, I wasn't trying to be

03:20.800 --> 03:22.835
on the show on that level,
you know what I'm saying.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.237
She can make faces
and do all that ----.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.238
She can do whatever she wants.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.639
You begged for it.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.241
You were saying that she came
after you, she wanted to be

03:28.308 --> 03:29.609
on the show.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.878
You're saying he came after you
because he wanted to be

03:31.945 --> 03:33.046
on the show.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.080
Is it fair they both
did it for opportunity?

03:34.147 --> 03:35.748
You guys are a
match made in heaven.

03:35.815 --> 03:37.417
You did it for
opportunity, that's fine.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.419
While Mally Mal and Masika
was in a relationship,

03:39.485 --> 03:41.020
I didn't introduce
you to the show?

03:41.087 --> 03:42.789
Berg, Berg, Berg.

03:42.855 --> 03:45.425
Berg and Sincere brought Nikki,
but they didn't want

03:45.491 --> 03:46.793
her until Masika.

03:46.859 --> 03:49.862
Who brought you to "Love and
Hip Hop: Hollywood", Nikki?

03:49.929 --> 03:53.333
{\an5}Sincere and Yung Berg both
presented the idea to me,

03:53.399 --> 03:56.002
{\an5}that's correct.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.704
But because I'm a loyal
bitch and I was in

03:57.770 --> 03:59.405
a ---- relationship.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.540
You told me the
---- was a homosexual.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.009
You told me too.

04:03.076 --> 04:08.514
[yelling]

04:08.581 --> 04:13.152
He didn't ---- your bitch.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.654
How come he has to leave?

04:14.721 --> 04:16.055
Answering the question now.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.757
{\an1}When Mally came to me and said,
"Hey, baby, you want to do

04:17.824 --> 04:19.091
this and that?"

04:19.158 --> 04:21.527
I said, "Let's do it," because
that really was my man,

04:21.594 --> 04:23.796
so what the ----, put this ho
in her place, no problem.

04:23.863 --> 04:24.797
All right.

04:24.864 --> 04:26.466
Let me ask you
something, Masika.

04:26.532 --> 04:29.102
Masika, has Mally been in
touch with her recently?

04:29.168 --> 04:30.003
Absolutely.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.437
Cussing her out.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.538
Up until a couple of days ago
and I blocked him from my phone.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.108
I blocked you from
his phone, actually.

04:35.174 --> 04:36.376
All right, is that a yes?

04:36.442 --> 04:37.310
Absolutely.

04:37.377 --> 04:38.411
Absolutely.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.413
Okay, can you hold that?

04:40.480 --> 04:41.614
Can you hold that for two
seconds because we need

04:41.681 --> 04:42.915
to move on here.

04:42.982 --> 04:46.519
When we met Fizz he was in a
relationship with Amanda,

04:46.586 --> 04:49.288
much to the displeasure of
his son's mother Moniece.

04:49.355 --> 04:53.059
While Fizz's main concern was
creating a family for his son,

04:53.126 --> 04:56.429
things came to a head when
the women faced off and

04:56.496 --> 04:58.731
put it all out on the table.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.066
Take a look.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.534
What you doing here?

05:01.601 --> 05:02.935
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

05:03.002 --> 05:04.270
I came to talk to you.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.438
{\an8}You're acting like me not
answering the phone is the end

05:05.505 --> 05:06.806
{\an8}of the world.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.108
{\an8}Respect me as Cameron's mother
and understand that we are

05:09.175 --> 05:12.712
{\an8}banded for life, like it or not,
until one of the three of us

05:12.779 --> 05:14.480
{\an8}is six feet under.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.215
{\an8}Moniece reached out to me.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.784
Whoa, whoa.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.951
Why are you laughing about that?

05:19.018 --> 05:20.386
Maybe she's
growing up a little bit.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.521
{\an8}You don't think I don't want
to know what bitches are

05:21.587 --> 05:22.989
{\an8}in and out of his life?

05:23.056 --> 05:24.757
{\an8}You're the fourth
since he's been born.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.993
{\an8}Worry about getting ---- and
let me worry about my child.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.795
{\an8}You're insane.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.663
I don't know, maybe I'm not,
maybe I'm not ready to play

05:30.730 --> 05:33.833
mommy or be this person.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.536
Play mommy, it's
not for pretend.

05:36.602 --> 05:38.071
We're not playing house.

05:38.137 --> 05:41.674
{\an8}Maybe she's not ready to
like assume responsibility

05:41.741 --> 05:43.976
{\an8}for somebody else's child.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.446
{\an8}I'm excited about the third
bedroom because if anything

05:46.512 --> 05:50.183
{\an8}ever happens to me, I know I
can come here and be safe.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.418
Your comments, "Oh, I'm going
to move into this bedroom",

05:52.485 --> 05:53.853
are extremely inappropriate.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.522
I mean, I can jokingly
say whatever I want.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.791
{\an8}He was a man that I
was ---- engaged to.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.593
{\an8}You're clearly not
understanding, so I need

06:00.660 --> 06:01.627
{\an8}to break it down to you.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.495
{\an8}I understand.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.896
{\an8}You don't get it.

06:03.963 --> 06:04.831
{\an8}I apologize for calling you
crazy and delusional, Moniece,

06:04.897 --> 06:05.832
{\an8}I apologize for that.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.200
{\an8}Thank you.

06:07.266 --> 06:10.770
{\an8}But let me explain it to you
for the hundredth ---- time.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.238
{\an8}Didn't I tell you?

06:12.305 --> 06:13.606
{\an8}Didn't I tell you?

06:13.673 --> 06:15.408
{\an8}Didn't I ---- tell you, ho?

06:15.475 --> 06:16.909
{\an8}Didn't I say it?

06:16.976 --> 06:18.578
Didn't I tell you?

06:18.644 --> 06:19.746
You decided to go talk to her.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.013
Do what the ---- you want to do.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.449
If that's what you
want to do, bounce.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.952
[applause]

06:26.018 --> 06:30.123
Moniece, you were so calm during
that entire conversation,

06:30.189 --> 06:32.525
what made you
grab her like that?

06:32.592 --> 06:35.161
Being talked to a certain
way is a trigger for me.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.295
Okay.

06:36.362 --> 06:40.967
{\an5}And I completely lose
sight of everything.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.069
That calm right there is
a little scary, isn't it?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.937
[laughter]

06:45.004 --> 06:46.639
What was it that she said
that actually made you snap?

06:46.706 --> 06:50.777
When you look me dead in my face
and you say, "Me and Drew were

06:50.843 --> 06:52.879
on a break, do I have to ----
explain this to you for

06:52.945 --> 06:54.580
the hundredth ---- time?"

06:54.647 --> 06:56.816
I talked to you for two
hours previously and you

06:56.883 --> 06:58.918
still kept asking.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.353
Time out, time out, time out.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.454
Do you get it?

07:01.521 --> 07:02.622
Do you understand it?

07:02.688 --> 07:04.724
Believe you me, if I'm
asking you something.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.159
I know the answer.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.326
I already know the truth.

07:07.393 --> 07:08.795
Okay.

07:08.861 --> 07:10.663
So, when you lie to me, that is
an insult to my intelligence and

07:10.730 --> 07:13.599
clearly I was right.

07:13.666 --> 07:17.570
[applause]

07:17.637 --> 07:20.907
But is there something to be
said for the name calling?

07:20.973 --> 07:24.410
I apologized for calling
her crazy and delusional.

07:24.477 --> 07:28.014
'Cause that tone, it's that
tone, it's that tone of do

07:28.080 --> 07:30.116
you understand?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.285
Bitch, I'm not
dumb, I'm not stupid.

07:32.351 --> 07:33.753
Clearly you're not getting it.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.423
Amanda, like on some level there
is a little bit of concern on

07:37.490 --> 07:40.493
your part about the
dynamic of their relationship.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.795
It's not concern, it's not that
at all, because I know Drew.

07:42.862 --> 07:47.900
It's Moniece thinking that she's
cute and she has this little.

07:47.967 --> 07:48.901
I'm beautiful.

07:48.968 --> 07:49.902
It's just annoying.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.904
I'm gorgeous, and
I'm funny as ----.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.107
You are, you're very pretty,
but it was just annoying.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.309
[applause]

07:56.375 --> 07:57.543
I'm intelligent.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.946
I'm an ----, I'm
all of the above.

08:00.012 --> 08:01.080
So, Moniece.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.416
What you get depends
on how you come at me.

08:03.482 --> 08:04.917
You get what you give to me.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.452
Give me bitch, you get bitch.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.721
Respect me, you get respect.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.389
That's all I'm saying.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.291
I was talking very
normally until you got crazy.

08:12.358 --> 08:13.893
[applause]

08:13.960 --> 08:14.961
On that note we're
going to take a break.

08:15.027 --> 08:16.562
Things are just getting started.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.231
We're going to be right
back with "Love and Hip Hop:

08:18.297 --> 08:19.265
Hollywood" the reunion.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.500
Stay tuned.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.036
{\an8}I did fall in love with somebody
else, but me and you broke up.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.705
{\an8}We broke up because I left you.

08:25.771 --> 08:27.340
{\an8}Did you ever get
that circumcision?

08:27.406 --> 08:29.642
{\an8}You're talking
about the turtleneck.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.010
{\an8}I had to let him know that
me and you had a

08:31.077 --> 08:32.410
{\an8}physical relationship before.

08:32.477 --> 08:33.880
{\an8}Oh, we had a physical
relationship before?

08:33.946 --> 08:35.414
{\an8}Oh, she's amazing
at what she does.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.716
{\an8}The singing or the ----?

08:36.782 --> 08:37.850
{\an8}Both.

08:37.917 --> 08:43.222
â™ª

08:43.289 --> 08:44.824
â™ª

08:44.891 --> 08:48.194
[applause]

08:48.261 --> 08:51.998
{\an5}Welcome back to "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.200
Now we're back here with Amanda,
Fizz and Moniece,

08:54.267 --> 08:57.069
who were having a little
trouble seeing eye-to-eye.

08:57.136 --> 08:59.372
But Moniece wasn't the only
problem in Fizz and Amanda's

08:59.438 --> 09:03.809
relationship, let's take a look.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.779
{\an8}We've been talking about having
our own place, I think we should

09:06.846 --> 09:08.347
{\an8}go look at some.

09:08.414 --> 09:09.448
{\an8}I didn't think it was
going to happen so soon.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.318
{\an8}Are you done with
that other situation?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.587
{\an8}Yes, yes, of course.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.656
{\an8}I'm not going to say
I can fully trust her.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.391
{\an8}She stepped out on
me, she cheated on me.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.660
{\an8}She stepped out
and you forgave her.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.262
{\an8}I need to know that what
you and I have is real.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.664
{\an8}I shouldn't have done what I
did, but I don't want you being

09:24.730 --> 09:26.599
{\an8}suspicious, second guessing
me, wondering where I am.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.168
{\an8}Why don't you work on
building and showing me

09:29.235 --> 09:31.404
that I can trust you?

09:31.470 --> 09:33.706
{\an8}Hello, calling from the
Capitol Grill in Miami.

09:33.773 --> 09:36.275
{\an8}I just wanted to confirm
the dinner reservation.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.877
{\an8}What you got dinner
reservations for?

09:37.944 --> 09:39.478
{\an8}It's probably the wrong number.

09:39.545 --> 09:40.446
{\an8}You're lying.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.414
{\an8}You're not
catching me in anything.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.548
{\an8}You're not
catching me in anything.

09:42.615 --> 09:45.751
{\an8}Everything I suspected
to be true was true.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.586
He was in your car, I was
driving right next to you.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.555
It's the same ----
you cheated on me with.

09:49.622 --> 09:50.823
{\an8}You feel like that's cool?

09:50.890 --> 09:51.991
{\an8}There was nothing from it.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.492
{\an8}It was just breakfast.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.761
{\an8}Let me go ---- a bitch tomorrow
and then go have breakfast with

09:55.828 --> 09:58.698
{\an8}her a few weeks later and
see how you feel about that.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.467
{\an8}---- bitch, I don't have
nothing else to say to you.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.337
Let's toast to the single life.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.205
Cheers to that.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.307
{\an8}Let's work on us
being friends and cool.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.376
{\an8}What, do you think I'm
trying to be your woman?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.412
{\an8}I mean, you might want to be.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.681
{\an8}Come here.

10:15.748 --> 10:19.285
{\an8}[kissing noises]

10:19.352 --> 10:21.587
Interesting.

10:21.654 --> 10:25.324
Interesting.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.526
Where Mally at?

10:27.593 --> 10:30.629
Mally, Mally, Mally?

10:30.696 --> 10:34.200
Nikki, we just heard you and
Mally were working on things.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.469
Did you tell Mally about Fizz?

10:36.535 --> 10:37.803
Absolutely.

10:37.870 --> 10:39.372
Was this a rebound hook up?

10:39.438 --> 10:41.907
{\an5}It's not a rebound because
rebound sounds like you're like,

10:41.974 --> 10:45.478
{\an5}oh you're just a weak rebound.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.646
It's like we definitely
distracted each other from

10:47.713 --> 10:48.814
what we were going through.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.049
Okay.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.551
And what is the status
of your relationship now?

10:52.618 --> 10:53.953
Us?

10:54.020 --> 10:55.621
We friends, we cool.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.857
{\an5}She was there for me through a
rough time, so I appreciate

10:57.923 --> 10:59.458
{\an5}her for that as well.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.161
{\an5}We just built a relationship,
like an honest, open book

11:02.228 --> 11:03.696
relationship, you know.

11:03.763 --> 11:06.432
Amanda said to you over and over
again that she didn't feel like

11:06.499 --> 11:08.834
she was ready for this,
she felt like it was a lot.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.203
DId you feel at some point
that you were forcing her?

11:11.270 --> 11:13.873
I wasn't pushing her to try to
be a mother to my son,

11:13.939 --> 11:15.574
I was pushing her to be honest
about everything else that

11:15.641 --> 11:17.476
was going on.

11:17.543 --> 11:18.878
And she couldn't just be
honest to say, you know,

11:18.944 --> 11:24.050
"Listen, I stepped out on you,
I like this dude."

11:24.116 --> 11:25.184
Because obviously
you did like him,

11:25.251 --> 11:27.319
you was talking to him nonstop.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.655
If she could have said that,
I would have then moved on.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.157
Are you ready to say that to
him now, just to be honest

11:31.223 --> 11:33.459
about what that
relationship was?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.662
{\an5}The relationship was I did fall
in love with someone else

11:36.729 --> 11:39.598
and I did like someone else,
but me and you broke up.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.033
That's ----.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.336
Now you want to say it because I
left and I'm not talking to you.

11:44.403 --> 11:45.671
Now you want to
be open about it.

11:45.738 --> 11:48.641
But before that you was
very, very secretive.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.444
I was being very
secretive about it, right.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.279
Right, so you left me
in a confused space.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.381
Right, but Drew, me
and you broke up.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.983
We broke up because
I left you, period.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.820
So, basically where does the
relationship stand now

12:00.886 --> 12:02.254
with you and Amanda?

12:02.321 --> 12:04.023
It sounds like Amanda,
you still want to work things

12:04.090 --> 12:05.524
out with Fizz?

12:05.591 --> 12:08.060
I mean, I love Drew and now
looking back at everything I

12:08.127 --> 12:12.832
realize that I did make a
mistake and I didn't fully

12:12.898 --> 12:15.134
understand what I wanted and
I was going through a lot.

12:15.201 --> 12:17.403
So, now I love Drew so much.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.472
Wait, now you love Drew so much?

12:19.538 --> 12:21.273
I don't know at this time, so
much as happened, I don't know

12:21.340 --> 12:22.741
if we're able to even fix it.

12:22.808 --> 12:23.876
[laughter]

12:23.943 --> 12:24.777
Wait a minute, what
is so funny, Moniece?

12:24.844 --> 12:26.112
Now, I love Drew so much?

12:26.178 --> 12:29.482
Where was the love
for the little boy?

12:29.548 --> 12:31.617
It was a lot to take in.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.152
Where was the love when
you were at breakfast?

12:33.219 --> 12:35.621
Where was the love when
you were signing a lease?

12:35.688 --> 12:38.657
Where was the love, Jesus?

12:38.724 --> 12:44.096
[laughter]

12:44.163 --> 12:46.165
Fizz, we have a fan
question for you.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.668
Do you think that Nikki
was an upgrade from Amanda?

12:49.735 --> 12:51.971
Ooh!

12:52.037 --> 12:55.107
Nikki's honesty
is a big upgrade.

12:55.174 --> 12:58.544
That boy good.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.212
Did you like the
way he phrased that?

13:00.279 --> 13:02.314
That was good.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.049
That was good, Fizz.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.819
[applause]

13:06.886 --> 13:09.188
All right, moving
into Omarion and Apryl.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.957
As they were entering a new
chapter in their lives, there

13:12.024 --> 13:15.394
was one person who didn't
like where the story was going,

13:15.461 --> 13:17.730
Omari's mother, Miss Leslie.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.533
She didn't think Apryl
was ready for motherhood.

13:20.599 --> 13:23.135
And before they could all move
forward, everybody had to

13:23.202 --> 13:24.937
get on the same page.

13:25.004 --> 13:25.871
Check it out.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.540
I'm not threatened with you.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.775
{\an8}I'm going to be his
mother his whole life.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.877
{\an8}You're the newcomer in the
family right now, I don't have

13:31.944 --> 13:33.412
{\an8}to get along with you.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.014
{\an8}I'm trying to ask
you how you feel.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.318
{\an8}How I feel right
now, I do not like you.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.719
{\an8}You won't be at the birth.

13:40.786 --> 13:41.887
{\an8}I need to be there.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.522
{\an8}You know that's not how I roll.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.691
{\an8}Mom, I need you to have a
conversation with her and I need

13:45.758 --> 13:47.359
{\an8}you to apologize, mom.

13:47.426 --> 13:51.297
{\an8}I apologize for disrespecting
you if you took it that way.

13:51.363 --> 13:55.034
{\an8}But if I can't be at the birth,
I'm not going to be in his life.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.969
{\an8}Obviously you know I want
you there at the birth.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.572
I'm hoping we can
just move past this.

13:59.638 --> 14:00.940
Yeah.

14:01.006 --> 14:01.707
Because I'm going to go into
premature labor if I have to

14:01.774 --> 14:02.608
keep dealing with this.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.377
I'm going to give you a hug.

14:05.444 --> 14:06.645
I just want to
tell you I love you.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.646
I love you, too.

14:07.713 --> 14:08.681
Okay.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.182
[applause]

14:10.249 --> 14:12.751
Omarion and Apryl
welcomed your first son, Mega,

14:12.818 --> 14:14.086
into the world this season.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.255
[cheers and applause]

14:16.322 --> 14:17.590
Congratulations.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.625
Hey, all right,
y'all, all right.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.495
So, Apryl, you had a lot
of mom issues this season.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.264
Has becoming a mom
yourself kind of changed your

14:25.331 --> 14:27.333
perspective on all that?

14:27.399 --> 14:32.404
Yeah, definitely with Miss
Leslie, now that I have a son,

14:32.471 --> 14:34.506
definitely the love for him,
I can understand the love

14:34.573 --> 14:36.308
she has for Omari.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.111
I know that it's not
personal, but I get it.

14:39.178 --> 14:42.047
So, Miss Leslie, how is the
relationship with Apryl changed

14:42.114 --> 14:43.482
since she had the baby?

14:43.549 --> 14:44.783
Have things improved?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.719
Absolutely.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.288
We're back to where we
started in the beginning.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.557
We just had a little
miscommunication, that's all.

14:51.624 --> 14:55.027
But we worked it out
and we're all good.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.295
[applause]

14:56.362 --> 15:00.599
All good in my hood.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.835
And I'm sure, Omarion, you're
very happy about that, because

15:02.901 --> 15:05.938
did you feel like you were being
torn and having to pick sides

15:06.005 --> 15:07.172
between the two?

15:07.239 --> 15:10.809
Of course because I
understand the circumstance.

15:10.876 --> 15:14.647
My mom having me at a young
age at 16, and you know, like me

15:14.713 --> 15:17.616
being her best friend and
spending a lot of time with me.

15:17.683 --> 15:22.121
And fast forward, me moving
along into my life and having

15:22.187 --> 15:27.459
this lovely, sexy,
beautiful thing right here.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.762
And that's how we
got the kid, y'all.

15:29.828 --> 15:31.130
Ba bow!

15:31.196 --> 15:32.665
Boy was up in that thing.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.066
All right, now.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.934
Absolutely.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.771
Let me ask you this, did you
ever get that circumcision?

15:38.837 --> 15:41.473
Oh, you're talking
about the turtleneck.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.976
The turtleneck, did you
ever get circumcised?

15:44.043 --> 15:45.744
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.146
You did get circumcised?

15:47.212 --> 15:49.014
I'm asking for one reason only.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.349
Okay, tell me.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.818
Not because I personally
care, let's say that right now.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.420
You ask, so I'm
going to tell you.

15:54.486 --> 15:57.256
No, but because apparently there
is a very circumcised selfie of

15:57.323 --> 15:58.891
you floating
around social media.

15:58.957 --> 15:59.825
I don't know nothing about that.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.327
Really?

16:01.393 --> 16:02.461
That's not real.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.562
I think we have that picture.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.130
No, no, no.

16:05.197 --> 16:06.131
Let's take a look.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.633
Okay.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.534
Is that not you?

16:08.600 --> 16:09.835
No, that ain't him.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.236
That's not you?

16:11.303 --> 16:12.237
You're kidding?

16:12.304 --> 16:14.106
Look at the
tattoos on your chest.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.441
I'll.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.911
Omari, stop.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.779
Turn up, turn up.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.481
Listen, listen, listen, this
is way too much time on

16:22.548 --> 16:24.183
Omari's member, I'm done.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.218
[applause]

16:26.285 --> 16:28.087
All right, we're going to take
a break, but coming up,

16:28.153 --> 16:32.057
don't move, it's "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.259
[cheers and applause]

16:34.326 --> 16:35.127
{\an8}Let me finish.

16:35.194 --> 16:35.961
{\an8}Let me finish.

16:36.028 --> 16:36.595
{\an8}You're a pathological liar.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.696
{\an8}Shut up, bitch.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.832
{\an8}Can you please go
knock her out real quick?

16:39.898 --> 16:40.999
{\an8}You want me to?

16:41.066 --> 16:42.267
{\an8}One more time.

16:42.334 --> 16:48.073
â™ª

16:48.140 --> 16:51.076
â™ª

16:51.143 --> 16:52.945
[applause]

16:53.011 --> 16:56.482
{\an5}Welcome back to "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.317
Well, Ray thought it was
business as usual when it came

16:58.384 --> 17:01.787
to his assistant Morgan, but
when she started to involve

17:01.854 --> 17:04.690
herself in more than just
his career, Ray questioned

17:04.757 --> 17:08.993
her loyalty and ultimately
had to let Morgan go.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.929
Take a look.

17:10.996 --> 17:12.931
Morgano.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.199
Really?

17:14.266 --> 17:15.233
{\an8}Morgan's more than an assistant
to me, Morgan's is

17:15.300 --> 17:16.535
{\an8}like my sister.

17:16.602 --> 17:17.202
{\an8}You work for me, right?

17:17.269 --> 17:18.337
{\an8}I know.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.339
{\an8}You cannot talk to
Teairra, that's not cool.

17:20.406 --> 17:23.608
{\an8}You are loyal and you're
loyal to a fault sometimes.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.910
{\an8}Loyalty is everything.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.012
{\an8}Do you ---- with me, or are
you defending that bitch?

17:27.079 --> 17:28.079
{\an8}I'm ---- with you.

17:28.146 --> 17:30.182
{\an8}This line right here
cannot be crossed.

17:30.249 --> 17:32.418
You jacked me for my assistant?

17:32.484 --> 17:33.786
You mad though?

17:33.852 --> 17:36.889
I'm pissed because the assistant
that I pay, Morgan, is now

17:36.955 --> 17:39.558
telling me she don't want to go
to work today, she wants to

17:39.625 --> 17:41.860
{\an8}be a celebrity correspondent.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.328
{\an8}Listen.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.164
{\an8}If you don't know that you're my
assistant, then you ain't never

17:45.230 --> 17:46.064
{\an8}got to be my assistant.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.200
{\an8}I'm fired?

17:48.267 --> 17:51.537
{\an8}When we get into it, there's one
person I run to to talk to,

17:51.603 --> 17:53.238
{\an8}it's Morgan.

17:53.305 --> 17:57.042
{\an8}Change your number because
I don't want Morgan having

17:57.109 --> 17:59.311
{\an8}your ---- number.

17:59.378 --> 18:00.879
{\an8}How you gonna have my
back and you're still in

18:00.946 --> 18:02.481
{\an8}touch with Teairra?

18:02.548 --> 18:04.183
{\an8}Telling her certain ---- that
I'm doing and private ----

18:04.249 --> 18:05.984
{\an8}that we might be talking about.

18:06.051 --> 18:06.852
{\an8}I'm not talking about
nothing private that we're

18:06.919 --> 18:07.719
{\an8}talking about.

18:07.786 --> 18:08.754
{\an8}You think that's cool.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.922
{\an8}I mean, what
you're saying about me.

18:09.988 --> 18:10.923
{\an8}You think that's cool?

18:10.989 --> 18:12.191
{\an8}Do you think that's cool?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.058
{\an8}No.

18:13.125 --> 18:13.892
{\an8}It's janky as ----.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.093
{\an8}Okay, and so are you.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.261
{\an8}You don't have no money.

18:16.328 --> 18:17.262
{\an8}Because you took it,
because you're a bitch.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.397
{\an8}You ---- on all your homies.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.431
{\an8}You want everybody to
work for ---- free.

18:19.498 --> 18:21.300
{\an8}---- you, goodbye.

18:21.366 --> 18:26.438
[applause]

18:26.505 --> 18:27.873
So, Ray.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.676
Morgan worked for you, but you
brought her into your life so

18:30.742 --> 18:32.778
{\an5}she became friends with
Teairra and with Princess.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.246
{\an5}Yeah, I did.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.850
So, just because you broke up
with those women, why did you

18:37.916 --> 18:42.488
expect Morgan to
break up wight them too?

18:42.554 --> 18:43.489
First off.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.057
Especially with me.

18:45.123 --> 18:46.892
Y'all wasn't a relationship.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.095
{\an5}She assisted me too.

18:50.162 --> 18:51.163
{\an5}It ain't about breaking up.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.298
So, we have a deeper history.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.034
Okay, you got it.

18:56.101 --> 19:01.073
But you also -- you had Princess
block the number, change.

19:01.139 --> 19:05.344
Yeah, I don't block numbers,
I just feel like when people

19:05.410 --> 19:07.946
texting my girl with negativity,
I'm going to tell her to change

19:08.013 --> 19:10.649
the number so she don't
have to deal with negativity.

19:10.716 --> 19:13.619
If I'm out hanging out and
Masika seen me out at the

19:13.685 --> 19:16.388
Yung Berg party and she
said something about my,

19:16.455 --> 19:17.756
I have something on my face.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.591
I'm like, "Girl, you ain't
never been this close to me."

19:19.658 --> 19:20.792
We're just joking or whatever.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.594
But then she runs back
and tells Princess,

19:22.661 --> 19:24.196
"Yo, guess what, Masika
was flirting with Ray."

19:24.263 --> 19:26.532
That's not what
happened, I'll let you finish.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.967
I'm just saying to go back and
tell her that and get her riled

19:29.034 --> 19:31.970
up when me and her
supposed to be 100 is wrong.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.071
Is that what happened?

19:33.138 --> 19:34.540
No, that is not what happened.

19:34.606 --> 19:37.309
Me and Princess were on the
phone the whole night when

19:37.376 --> 19:39.478
{\an5}you guys were
shooting your scene.

19:39.545 --> 19:42.214
{\an5}And we were both going back and
forth about the bitch asses

19:42.281 --> 19:43.782
that was going on.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.119
And when Ray pulled up, I
was calming Princess down.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.887
Yes, I was telling her,
"Don't worry, this is going,

19:48.954 --> 19:49.888
he's not doing this.

19:49.955 --> 19:50.856
Don't worry."

19:50.923 --> 19:52.357
I was doing that,
absoluely, I was.

19:52.424 --> 19:56.395
But to say I was making a scene
that he was ---- with Masika or

19:56.461 --> 19:59.231
something like that, that
was not even happening at all.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.934
And then to go and wake him up
at 5:00 in the morning like,

20:02.000 --> 20:03.068
"Look what Morgan just sent me."

20:03.135 --> 20:04.369
That ain't even how it happened.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.771
Did I ever show you anything?

20:05.837 --> 20:07.873
She didn't say, "Look what
Morgan sent me, she just yelled

20:07.940 --> 20:10.809
out something about Masika."

20:10.876 --> 20:12.678
I'm like, "It's 5:00 in the
morning and Masika's in our

20:12.744 --> 20:14.780
conversation in the bedroom."

20:14.846 --> 20:16.114
I'm the one that's been going
back and saying ----,

20:16.181 --> 20:17.616
absolutely not.

20:17.683 --> 20:20.319
The only person I confided in
was ---- that I felt about Ray

20:20.385 --> 20:22.254
because of the way Ray does me.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.522
Hold on.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.890
What's happening here, Ray?

20:24.957 --> 20:26.491
Just some foul ---- going on
and I don't like that ----.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.926
The truth.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.628
Hands down.

20:29.695 --> 20:32.064
Everybody needs to address the
situations with me because there

20:32.130 --> 20:33.265
about to be a problem up here.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.433
You don't want the
truth to be told?

20:34.499 --> 20:35.534
Shut the ---- up.

20:35.601 --> 20:36.368
No, you shut the ---- up.

20:36.435 --> 20:37.102
About to be a real problem.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.036
You're not a boss, ----.

20:38.103 --> 20:38.770
You work for me though.

20:38.837 --> 20:39.771
I did work for you.

20:39.838 --> 20:40.472
Keep it real.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.206
All right.

20:41.273 --> 20:41.940
You shut the ---- up.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.175
I did work for you.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.409
I'm not going to say nothing
else to you, Morgan,

20:44.476 --> 20:46.478
I'm only talking to you,
Morgan, I mean, Mona.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.547
Exactly, my name
stays in your mouth.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.582
Just address everything to me.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.352
Yeah, you can never own your
----, you can dish that ----

20:53.418 --> 20:57.322
out, expect people to take
whatever you do to them,

20:57.389 --> 20:59.625
but the second someone
reacts back to you

20:59.691 --> 21:01.526
or lashes out, it's
a ---- problem.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.128
No one can be
forgiven, nothing, right?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.830
You can't take
responsibility for ----.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.198
And that's your problem.

21:06.264 --> 21:08.700
You know what, Ray, I
feel so sorry for you.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.603
Because at the end of the day
I really do love you and I hope

21:11.670 --> 21:13.605
you get the help
that you ---- need.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.207
I can't hear anything that
this chick is talking to me.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.608
You need help.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.577
You wish, go ahead.

21:18.644 --> 21:19.378
You know it.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.680
You know it.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.316
Everybody in this ---- cast
knows who I'm talking about.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.451
Buy out the whole ---- cast
if that's what you gotta do.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.655
I don't give a ----.

21:29.721 --> 21:31.523
What I did to Nikki, me
and Nikki hashed it out,

21:31.590 --> 21:33.158
she know I did it.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.326
She know I'm not
going to go there

21:34.393 --> 21:35.594
because it doesn't even matter.

21:35.661 --> 21:36.995
She called me, she
apologized and I talked to her.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.163
Am I lying, Nik?

21:38.230 --> 21:39.564
Let's just keep it real though.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.167
I'm a little confused, I'm
sure the audience is confused.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.169
At the end of the day, ssh.

21:44.236 --> 21:48.540
Hold on a second, let me get to
the bottom of what's going on.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.776
So, the two of you had an off
camera conversation about

21:50.842 --> 21:53.145
your beef this season,
but Nikki's denying she

21:53.211 --> 21:54.846
ever apologized to you.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.915
Nikki got balls today because
Ray J talked to her, right?

21:56.982 --> 21:59.551
Bitch, I've been that bitch.

21:59.618 --> 22:00.786
You're an assistant.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.688
I'm the boss,
you're the assistant.

22:02.754 --> 22:05.090
I'm the boss,
you're the assistant.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.660
He's a boss, I'm a boss.

22:08.727 --> 22:10.729
You're not a boss,
baby, believe that.

22:10.796 --> 22:11.596
Uh, uh.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.664
Uh uh nothing.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.399
You may be able to
do that with Masika.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.701
Oh, no she can't.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.936
You begged me not to ----
you up, so shut up, please.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.171
Be quiet.

22:19.237 --> 22:20.405
Bitch.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.441
Be quiet, be quiet, you're
not going to do nothing.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.775
You know you're all
going to come over there.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.277
You know you're not
going to come over there.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.878
So sit back down.

22:26.945 --> 22:28.747
I'll make it easy
for you, bitch.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.382
I'll make it easy
for you, come on.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.484
Come on.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.619
Ssh, at the end of the
day, like I was saying.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.790
At the end of the day I'm the
bitch and you're the assistant.

22:38.857 --> 22:39.858
Thank you.

22:39.925 --> 22:40.592
Nikki, you know
you're not about that.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.127
Thank you, thank you.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.029
I'm going to let you take a look
at my ass because my ----

22:44.096 --> 22:45.097
is so bomb.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.031
Do you want to say
something, Princess?

22:46.098 --> 22:46.932
I have a lot to say.

22:46.998 --> 22:47.833
Okay.

22:47.899 --> 22:49.301
Let me hear from you, Princess.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.470
I loved Morgan like a sister.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.139
{\an5}I ran to her and vented to
her when Ray and I were going

22:54.206 --> 22:55.874
{\an5}through it because I felt like
she was a mutual person

22:55.941 --> 22:57.943
{\an5}who knew us both.

22:58.009 --> 23:01.179
And she would tell me stuff
all the time and I would have

23:01.246 --> 23:02.848
attitudes with him and not
even tell him what was going

23:02.914 --> 23:05.050
on with me.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.586
She would tell me, you know,
basically everything he was

23:07.652 --> 23:08.520
doing, who he was calling.

23:08.587 --> 23:09.988
Like what?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.524
Why were you letting
anybody else get in your ear?

23:12.591 --> 23:15.627
Because I felt like, you
know, he let her in our circle.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.896
She was like a sister,
so I gravitated to her.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.499
I ---- up, my mistake.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.234
We both had a rough year.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.536
I ran to her and I vented to
her every time I was upset.

23:24.603 --> 23:27.272
You trusted Princess with a
lot of information as well.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.340
Absolutely.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.608
She felt like I
threw her under the bus.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.042
She sent me a screen shot of
Masika saying Ray was

23:31.109 --> 23:32.077
flirting with her.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.645
Was that what the
screenshot was of?

23:33.712 --> 23:35.547
Why don't you show
it to us real quick?

23:35.614 --> 23:39.785
I'm not going to show
it to you because, okay.

23:39.851 --> 23:43.655
Masika said -- she
sent me a screen shot.

23:43.722 --> 23:46.691
Let me finish, let me finish.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.460
You're a pathological liar.

23:48.527 --> 23:49.561
No.

23:49.628 --> 23:50.495
Shut up, ----.

23:50.562 --> 23:51.596
I'm not going to shut up.

23:51.663 --> 23:52.364
Can you please go
knock her out real quick.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.131
You want me to?

23:53.198 --> 23:55.700
One time.

23:55.767 --> 24:04.042
[talking all at once]

24:04.109 --> 24:07.379
You better put me down.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.213
Watch out.

24:08.280 --> 24:14.486
[talking all at once]

24:14.553 --> 24:16.454
Put me the ---- down,
because you're going to

24:16.521 --> 24:18.623
see what I really do.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.958
You're lying and you know that.

24:20.025 --> 24:21.726
They're lying out their ----
teeth that I'm not telling

24:21.793 --> 24:23.094
the truth about ----.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.130
No, ---- that, I'm sick of
this, ten years of this ----.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.165
---- that, yo.

24:27.232 --> 24:29.067
He gonna tell her to go.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.101
I'm so done.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.002
You want me to
tell the bitch to go?

24:31.069 --> 24:32.337
I got you, ----.

24:32.404 --> 24:33.972
Take me to the dressing room.

24:34.039 --> 24:38.310
---- that.

24:38.376 --> 24:40.078
{\an8}I never told his business.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.813
{\an8}I never told that ----.

24:41.880 --> 24:46.451
{\an8}I was so loyal to
that ---- bitch ass.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.720
{\an8}Morgan.

24:48.787 --> 24:49.888
[banging]

24:49.955 --> 24:51.289
Morgan, stop it.

24:51.356 --> 24:53.458
I did so much for him.

24:53.525 --> 24:57.963
Like what the
----, are you serious?

24:58.029 --> 25:01.333
Morgan, let him
look at your knuckles.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.235
{\an8}Teairra, you had a
physical relationship with Berg?

25:03.301 --> 25:04.436
{\an8}No.

25:04.502 --> 25:05.637
{\an8}Teairra gave me ----.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.105
{\an8}I swear to God.

25:07.172 --> 25:13.378
â™ª

25:13.445 --> 25:16.348
â™ª

25:16.414 --> 25:17.749
[applause]

25:17.816 --> 25:19.684
{\an5}We're back with "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.754
For Yung Berg, keeping girls in
constant rotation was always

25:22.821 --> 25:24.556
his plan of attack.

25:24.623 --> 25:29.094
His multiple women were what
he referred to as his pentagon.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.062
But when Masika
decided to join the party,

25:31.129 --> 25:34.165
Berg had to consider
blowing it up.

25:34.232 --> 25:36.201
Take a look.

25:36.268 --> 25:39.371
When it comes to women, on
Monday I see one, on Tuesday

25:39.437 --> 25:42.173
I see another, on Wednesday
it might be another woman.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.742
On Thursday it
might be another woman.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.744
{\an8}On Friday it's going
to be another woman.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.779
{\an8}I double up on Saturday
and I rest on the sabbath,

25:47.846 --> 25:48.947
{\an8}like Jesus Christ.

25:49.014 --> 25:52.984
{\an8}You in it too,
you're in the mix.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.953
{\an8}Turn up, shorty.

25:55.020 --> 25:58.523
â™ª

25:58.590 --> 25:59.824
I'm really a nice guy.

25:59.891 --> 26:02.060
I know you're a nice guy.

26:02.127 --> 26:05.063
I'm impressed, like you looking
good, you're sounding good.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.198
{\an8}Our chemistry is so crazy.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.936
{\an8}She might want to creep in the
pentagon and blow that thing up.

26:11.002 --> 26:13.538
{\an8}You brought the
girls out today.

26:13.605 --> 26:16.274
{\an8}Oh, stop it, please.

26:16.341 --> 26:20.345
{\an8}I would blow up the
love pentagon for you.

26:20.412 --> 26:24.215
{\an8}You would have to
demolish this pentagon.

26:24.282 --> 26:25.550
Are you ready?

26:25.617 --> 26:27.819
I am, I'm more than ready.

26:27.886 --> 26:32.357
[applause]

26:32.424 --> 26:34.025
Berg, did you blow
up the pentagon?

26:34.092 --> 26:35.961
Yeah, this is my love.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.595
We're in a
relationship, she's my girl.

26:37.662 --> 26:39.364
Oh, your love.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.032
Masika, are you in love?

26:41.099 --> 26:42.434
Yeah.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.437
We've always loved each
other before we started dating.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.906
It was a different type of love.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.975
We just wasn't ---- and now
the ---- came in and kind

26:50.041 --> 26:52.610
of corrupted everything.

26:52.677 --> 26:54.346
There are no other women
that you're involved with?

26:54.412 --> 26:56.314
Yeah, and don't get
the pentagon messed up.

26:56.381 --> 26:59.084
{\an5}It's not like I'm ---- everybody
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

26:59.150 --> 27:02.020
Thursday, double up and
---- twice on Saturday.

27:02.087 --> 27:05.357
It's like different women
might serve different purposes.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.592
Me and Teairra have a crazy
relationship to where we can

27:07.659 --> 27:10.228
have jokes and hang out.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.129
That might just be Tuesday.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.897
How crazy?

27:12.964 --> 27:15.133
What do you mean?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.601
{\an5}I mean, how crazy?

27:16.668 --> 27:18.436
{\an5}Why do you even care?

27:18.503 --> 27:19.337
What do you mean?

27:19.404 --> 27:20.605
They're homies.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.040
Why would you even care?

27:22.107 --> 27:23.942
Okay, let me be
all the way honest.

27:24.009 --> 27:24.843
I had to let him
know me and you had

27:24.909 --> 27:26.811
a physical relationship before.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.046
Okay.

27:28.113 --> 27:29.781
Oh, we had a physical
relationship before?

27:29.848 --> 27:31.983
Okay, so this is
new information.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.886
Teairra, you had a
physical relationship with Berg.

27:34.953 --> 27:36.154
{\an5}No.

27:36.221 --> 27:37.022
{\an5}No?

27:37.088 --> 27:38.089
{\an5}We kissed.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.157
Whoa.

27:39.224 --> 27:40.759
Okay, you kissed.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.894
During the course of
the season or before?

27:42.961 --> 27:44.529
Yeah, during the
course of the season.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.064
Teairra gave me ----.

27:46.131 --> 27:49.334
[squeals]

27:49.401 --> 27:50.902
I gave you ----?

27:50.969 --> 27:52.037
Yeah, you did.

27:52.103 --> 27:52.904
Really?

27:52.971 --> 27:54.039
It's my friend though.

27:54.105 --> 27:55.240
I'm not calling her
out in a bad way.

27:55.306 --> 27:59.144
Yes, you were.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.345
I'm just being truthful.

28:00.412 --> 28:01.446
He's lying.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.414
I got a text message.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.281
Don't do that.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.416
You got text messages?

28:04.482 --> 28:06.017
What do they say?

28:06.084 --> 28:07.385
Let me ---- your ----?

28:07.452 --> 28:08.586
Show me those text messages.

28:08.653 --> 28:10.021
You spoke about my ----
inside a text message.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.758
I got footage of you ---- with
yourself, playing with yourself.

28:13.825 --> 28:14.793
Show it.

28:14.859 --> 28:15.527
Don't do that.

28:15.593 --> 28:16.394
Okay.

28:16.461 --> 28:17.128
Well, this is what I will say.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.329
This is what I will say.

28:18.396 --> 28:19.998
I have no problems
with you, Teairra.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.767
I'm a crazy ass girlfriend.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.202
I go through your phone.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.937
I've ---- follow you in a car.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.705
I'm on your grim, I'm
creeping in the den.

28:27.772 --> 28:31.876
But you know it, even if I did
---- his ----, what about it?

28:31.943 --> 28:32.877
Can I just say
what I want to say?

28:32.944 --> 28:34.145
My ---- is good.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.680
Hold that thought
for a quick second?

28:35.747 --> 28:38.516
So, Teairra, are you saying
that it actually did happen?

28:38.583 --> 28:42.020
I'm saying that he's a
fraud ass bitch ass ----.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.354
I wrote you a great song.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.622
I have no problem with you.

28:44.689 --> 28:45.924
I have no problem with you.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.793
You think it's coming from me.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.762
I just think it's funny that
everybody's fighting over

28:50.829 --> 28:53.865
the one ---- that they
told me not to be with.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.634
Hazel has a very good point.

28:56.701 --> 29:01.806
[applause]

29:01.873 --> 29:03.975
You told her not to mess
with Berg and apparently

29:04.042 --> 29:05.977
everybody's messing with Berg.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.847
So, when you were messing with
Berg, you're saying you knew

29:08.913 --> 29:11.916
he and Teairra had an
intimate relationship?

29:11.983 --> 29:12.851
Supposedly.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.052
Supposedly?

29:14.119 --> 29:14.819
I went through his phone
and read all the messages

29:14.886 --> 29:15.453
between you two.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.855
I know.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.623
So, in a message you're saying,
"Oh, come over here

29:18.690 --> 29:20.158
and ---- my ----."

29:20.225 --> 29:22.026
You didn't do it, swear to
God on your life right now.

29:22.093 --> 29:27.265
Swear to God on my
life, die right now, bitch.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.467
We're not doing that.

29:29.534 --> 29:31.169
If you ain't ---- ----, why
you getting off the couch?

29:31.236 --> 29:36.107
Oh, my God, no.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.075
Berg, Berg.

29:37.142 --> 29:37.876
It's war.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.077
Teairra is your friend.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.278
You said you care about her.

29:40.345 --> 29:41.379
I was his friend.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.447
I do.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.948
What was the point
of telling us this?

29:44.015 --> 29:45.083
I just want us to be honest.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.184
Okay.

29:46.251 --> 29:48.586
She's amazing at what she does.

29:48.653 --> 29:49.888
The singing or the ----?

29:49.954 --> 29:52.857
Both.

29:52.924 --> 29:53.992
It's flawless.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.627
I can't take
nothing away from her.

29:55.693 --> 29:57.295
It's fire.

29:57.362 --> 29:59.597
Mona, I'm trying to
stay in my chair.

29:59.664 --> 30:00.999
I need you to
stay in your chair.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.600
Are you telling me
nothing happened?

30:02.667 --> 30:07.038
We kissed and that's what it
was, I don't care what he says.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.741
All right, we've got to take a
break, but when we get back

30:09.807 --> 30:13.211
Nia questions Soulja Boy's
rapper lifestyle.

30:13.278 --> 30:16.581
It's "Love and Hip Hop:
Hollywood" the reunion.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.817
[applause]

30:19.884 --> 30:22.987
{\an8}She said she never did ----,
she just come to my ---- house

30:23.054 --> 30:24.923
{\an8}and ---- his ----
and kissing him.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.525
{\an8}You did everything that
I thought you wouldn't.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.427
{\an8}You mad at me because I said
you would ---- your momma's man?

30:29.494 --> 30:34.666
You just ---- the ---- ----
that you -- like I can't.

30:34.732 --> 30:36.134
I thought the
bitch was my friend.

30:36.201 --> 30:39.237
I felt ---- bad for
doing whatever the ----.

30:39.304 --> 30:42.540
She's not nobody's friend, she
cares about nobody but herself.

30:42.607 --> 30:43.474
It's fine.

30:43.541 --> 30:44.842
It's cool.

30:44.909 --> 30:47.478
It's ---- disappointing.

30:47.545 --> 30:51.082
{\an8}You were very hurt that
Nia didn't tell the whole truth.

30:51.149 --> 30:52.917
{\an8}It's nobody's business for one.

30:52.984 --> 30:54.986
{\an8}How is it nobody's business,
but it's public information

30:55.053 --> 30:56.955
{\an8}the whole ---- internet
know, but I don't know?

30:57.021 --> 30:59.224
{\an8}I think her lip looks ---- up
because her lip don't move.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.458
{\an8}And it's like, don't try
to attack me about ----.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.193
{\an8}There's nothing in it.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.395
{\an8}You think you're natural
like a ---- masterpiece?

31:04.462 --> 31:05.964
{\an8}Yes, I am and watch the bitch.

31:06.030 --> 31:11.102
â™ª

31:11.169 --> 31:13.571
â™ª

31:13.638 --> 31:15.840
[applause]

31:15.907 --> 31:18.243
Welcome back to the reunion.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.411
Well, it took eight years for
Soulja Boy and Nia to

31:20.478 --> 31:22.614
finally make things
official between them.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.350
But the lifestyle of a
celebrity can take its toll

31:25.416 --> 31:27.385
on any relationship.

31:27.452 --> 31:30.121
And when the parties, the
touring and the women didn't

31:30.188 --> 31:32.624
stop, Nia had to consider
whether it was time

31:32.690 --> 31:34.192
for her to go.

31:34.259 --> 31:35.693
Let's take a look.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.995
What?

31:37.061 --> 31:39.864
I just want to say happy
birthday to my baby, my heart,

31:39.931 --> 31:41.299
my everything.

31:41.366 --> 31:43.001
I love you so much.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.069
{\an8}Us together, what are we doing?

31:45.136 --> 31:48.973
{\an8}You know what I'm talking about,
the hos, groupies, all that.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.541
{\an8}They gotta go.

31:50.608 --> 31:56.147
{\an8}What I saw on the internet in
regards to Soulja and Corrin?

31:56.214 --> 31:58.650
{\an8}You don't want to talk about it?

31:58.716 --> 31:59.817
{\an8}She's confused.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.152
{\an8}She doesn't know what
you're talking about.

32:01.219 --> 32:02.320
It's all over the internet.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.222
You're acting like I'm
dating her, she my girl.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.657
That's what it looked like.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.592
How's that what it looked like?

32:07.659 --> 32:09.227
{\an8}Do you care about
how I feel about that?

32:09.294 --> 32:10.528
{\an8}I'm done with this.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.463
{\an8}I was wrong for walking out,
but I don't want to focus

32:12.530 --> 32:13.865
{\an8}on the past.

32:13.931 --> 32:16.267
{\an8}I just want to make sure you're
ready to actually be a man

32:16.334 --> 32:17.969
{\an8}and have a family.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.337
{\an8}I'm ready.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.472
I walk in the door and Dre's
having a full on day party,

32:21.539 --> 32:22.807
in the house.

32:22.874 --> 32:23.941
Ray!

32:24.008 --> 32:25.410
{\an8}Ba dum dum.

32:25.476 --> 32:26.611
{\an8}You didn't communicate,
that's the problem we're

32:26.678 --> 32:27.745
{\an8}having right now.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.515
{\an8}You're saying the same
thing over and over.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.751
{\an8}Negative energy Nia,
get away, go away.

32:33.818 --> 32:37.689
I'm pregnant, but I haven't
gotten a chance to talk

32:37.755 --> 32:39.123
to him about it yet.

32:39.190 --> 32:40.925
He doesn't know
about any of this.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.428
One moment I'm thinking
I'm about to have a baby

32:43.494 --> 32:44.862
and the next I'm not.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.898
There's times like
this I really need him.

32:46.964 --> 32:49.634
You knew what was going on
and I didn't get anything

32:49.701 --> 32:51.035
{\an8}back from you.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.603
{\an8}Just like you was
going through something,

32:52.670 --> 32:53.938
{\an8}I was going through something.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.740
{\an8}I know I was in the wrong
and I'm telling you I'm sorry.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.810
{\an8}But you gotta understand
what I was going through,

32:58.876 --> 33:01.312
it's my child too.

33:01.379 --> 33:05.016
Soulja, one of the relationships
that we saw come between

33:05.083 --> 33:08.286
you guys on the show
was Corrin ----.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.288
Now, what was the
nature of that relationship?

33:10.355 --> 33:13.157
Was that somebody you
were intimate with, Soulja?

33:13.224 --> 33:14.459
That's the homie.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.227
What does that mean exactly?

33:16.294 --> 33:19.063
That mean that it's somebody
I was kicking it with,

33:19.130 --> 33:20.264
{\an5}you feeling me?

33:20.331 --> 33:21.933
{\an5}I ---- with her, you
know what I'm saying.

33:21.999 --> 33:24.135
But there wasn't no
relationship, not like me

33:24.202 --> 33:26.404
and Nia going on, you
dig what I'm saying?

33:26.471 --> 33:27.505
Yesi, you're shaking your
head and I know that

33:27.572 --> 33:29.874
you ended up inadvertently.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.376
{\an8}Yeah, dropping that bomb.

33:31.442 --> 33:33.311
I felt bad that I dropped the
bomb on her, because I can only

33:33.378 --> 33:37.648
imagine what she felt like when
I had to show her those photos.

33:37.715 --> 33:39.384
And it looked more
than just homies.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.086
This homie ----, I
mean, I'm not stupid.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.154
I'm not.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.555
I'm far from stupid.

33:44.622 --> 33:47.759
Of course, I love him and I
try not to think about it,

33:47.825 --> 33:49.861
but I know what really goes on.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.830
I know when he's home
I'm with him all the time.

33:52.897 --> 33:56.367
But when he's on the road,
it's a whole other story.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.703
Soulja's been real open
about his relationships

33:58.770 --> 34:00.238
on social media.

34:00.304 --> 34:01.806
He's lived his life very openly.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.574
Do you think
sometimes he puts too much?

34:03.641 --> 34:05.309
Too open, yeah.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.112
I don't know if Nia understood
she took that on,

34:08.179 --> 34:09.380
you feeling me?

34:09.447 --> 34:11.516
At the end of the day I
feel like it is important.

34:11.581 --> 34:12.884
That's what got me in the game.

34:12.949 --> 34:15.219
The internet got me here, I made
all my money, my millions,

34:15.286 --> 34:16.621
off the internet.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.489
So, I feel like I owe it to my
fans to always keep it real

34:19.556 --> 34:21.025
with them, you dig?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.628
And it feels like the internet
dictates your relationship

34:23.694 --> 34:25.228
because when you and Nia fall
out, it feels like the first

34:25.295 --> 34:27.165
thing you do is block
her on social media.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.933
[laughter]

34:29.000 --> 34:30.701
That's how Nia knows
when you're mad at her.

34:30.768 --> 34:31.936
Yeah.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.504
[laughter]

34:33.571 --> 34:35.739
When we get into disputes or
something that happens,

34:35.806 --> 34:37.442
that's the first thing that I go
to, you know what I'm saying.

34:37.507 --> 34:38.876
I'm getting better at that now,
I don't block her no more with

34:38.943 --> 34:40.344
none of that.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.646
You know what I'm saying?

34:41.712 --> 34:43.481
After she lost the baby, that
was a time when you knew

34:43.547 --> 34:45.449
she'd need you.

34:45.516 --> 34:48.052
And you went out and you blocked
her on your social media then.

34:48.119 --> 34:49.520
Right.

34:49.587 --> 34:53.024
It was different
circumstances, you feeling me?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.759
I was overseas in Brazil
and she was just coming

34:54.826 --> 34:56.828
at me so disrespectful.

34:56.893 --> 35:00.765
I just felt like I just needed
to completely shut her off,

35:00.832 --> 35:02.733
so that's why I blocked her.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.002
Another thing that I saw on
social media is that Soulja,

35:05.069 --> 35:08.105
you were very hurt that
Nia didn't tell you the

35:08.172 --> 35:11.642
whole truth about her
relationship with her dad,

35:11.709 --> 35:14.245
Teddy Riley, that he was
not her biological father.

35:14.312 --> 35:15.246
Uh huh.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.615
Why was that such
a problem for you?

35:17.682 --> 35:21.319
I don't really give no ---- that
he her biological father or not.

35:21.385 --> 35:22.753
It's just the fact
that she didn't tell me.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.589
And it's the fact
of how I found out.

35:24.655 --> 35:27.258
I felt blindsided.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.861
I felt deceived, lied to.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.796
I felt a whole lot of ----.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.065
So, Nia, why
didn't you tell him?

35:34.131 --> 35:35.366
That's a good question.

35:35.433 --> 35:38.402
Like I told him, I didn't
feel the need to tell him.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.805
He's been my dad my entire life.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.807
It's nobody's business, for one.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.141
Can you understand that, Soulja?

35:44.208 --> 35:45.743
No, I can't understand that.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.312
How it ain't nobody's business,
but it's public information.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.780
The whole ---- internet
knows, but I don't' know.

35:49.847 --> 35:52.250
All right, calm down.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.885
It ain't nobody's business,
it's the whole world's business.

35:53.951 --> 35:56.320
If I wouldn't have read that
---- on the internet, I probably

35:56.387 --> 35:57.755
wouldn't ever find out.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.757
So, Nia, where do things stand
with you and Soulja right now?

35:59.824 --> 36:00.858
We're good today.

36:00.925 --> 36:01.592
We're good today.

36:01.659 --> 36:02.894
Today.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.228
We're good today.

36:04.295 --> 36:06.664
We're going to take a break,
but coming up, don't move,

36:06.731 --> 36:09.033
it's "Love and Hip Hop:
Hollywood" the reunion.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.370
[cheers and applause]

36:12.436 --> 36:13.604
{\an8}You got ---- done.

36:13.671 --> 36:14.972
{\an8}My mug shot looks
better than your wallet.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.107
{\an8}Never, honey, I"m going
to show you what a

36:16.173 --> 36:17.308
{\an8}masterpiece looks like.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.643
{\an8}I have heels higher
than your self esteem.

36:18.709 --> 36:19.877
{\an8}Sit down.

36:19.944 --> 36:39.030
â™ª

36:39.096 --> 36:41.198
â™ª

36:41.265 --> 36:44.535
[applause]

36:44.602 --> 36:47.305
{\an5}We're back with "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.975
There has been some talk about
plastic surgery this season.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.543
And many people believe
that just comes with

36:52.610 --> 36:54.412
the Hollywood lifestyle.

36:54.478 --> 36:57.481
How many ladies on this cast
have undergone some kind

36:57.548 --> 37:00.785
of surgery, have gone under
the knife, let's get a show

37:00.851 --> 37:04.221
of hands, ladies.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.590
Okay.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.292
Moniece, now surprisingly
you raised your hand.

37:08.359 --> 37:09.760
What have you had done?

37:09.827 --> 37:13.197
When I had my deal I had muscle
fillers in the top of my behind.

37:13.264 --> 37:16.367
I've had my lips at one point.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.603
Nikki, what have you had done?

37:18.669 --> 37:19.870
My nose and my titties.

37:19.937 --> 37:21.205
And your ass?

37:21.272 --> 37:23.040
Oh, no, you can check if
there's silicone in my ass.

37:23.107 --> 37:25.276
{\an5}Is that all you've had done
is the nose and the breast?

37:25.343 --> 37:26.944
{\an5}I think we have a
picture of a before.

37:27.011 --> 37:27.878
Let's see.

37:27.945 --> 37:28.946
See how pretty I was still.

37:29.013 --> 37:30.781
Pretty then, pretty now.

37:30.848 --> 37:33.117
You look like a very
different person, though, right?

37:33.184 --> 37:34.218
Oh, you think so?

37:34.285 --> 37:35.586
I was 17 there and I'm 24 now.

37:35.653 --> 37:36.988
It's very possible.

37:37.054 --> 37:39.190
So, it's a much younger you.

37:39.256 --> 37:41.759
What have you had
done, TT, the girls?

37:41.826 --> 37:44.528
No, no, these are
all natural, babe.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.197
There's been a lot of
controversy about these,

37:46.263 --> 37:48.466
but these are mine, I
was born with these.

37:48.532 --> 37:51.802
What I did have done was a
simple procedure to my nose.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.070
I had a hump in my nose.

37:53.137 --> 37:56.874
So I got an injection
to fill the hump in.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.342
Okay, well, I think
we have a picture.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.710
Let's take a quick look at that.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.178
Oh, look t you.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.047
It was a very young TT.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.915
So, the nose is
different on that one.

38:04.982 --> 38:05.950
Masika, what did you have done?

38:06.017 --> 38:08.152
I got my breast
done five years ago.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.454
{\an5}Okay, that's it?

38:10.521 --> 38:15.126
{\an5}Well, I made the mistake of
accompanying Miss Hazel to her

38:15.192 --> 38:19.764
doctor where she got injected
in her cheeks, her nose,

38:19.830 --> 38:21.999
her forehead,
her chin, her lips.

38:22.066 --> 38:24.035
He was offering me
half off on mine.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.437
She made sure she got it comped.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.772
I have my receipts.

38:27.838 --> 38:29.407
I actually know.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.042
{\an5}I did not like it.

38:31.108 --> 38:34.045
{\an5}I went to Yesi's doctor who
injected something else

38:34.111 --> 38:35.646
to dissolve it.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.782
But your lip don't move,
your top lip don't move.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.050
Your face isn't moving.

38:39.116 --> 38:39.984
It's perfect though.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.052
What do you want
my top lip to do?

38:41.118 --> 38:42.853
It's perfect.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.155
Would you like it to bite?

38:44.221 --> 38:47.925
Anyway, I didn't do the
top, I did the bottom.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.260
And it is now gone.

38:49.326 --> 38:51.095
So, as far as
surgery goes, that's it.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.563
What about the nose though?

38:52.630 --> 38:53.698
The nose looks a
little different.

38:53.764 --> 38:55.966
That's an amazing contour.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.302
This nose was
handcrafted by Jesus himself.

38:58.369 --> 39:01.772
Don't be mad.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.474
Hazel, what have you had done?

39:03.541 --> 39:06.544
I've had an injection
in my noise, same as TT.

39:06.610 --> 39:11.949
We went to the same doctor,
and I got my lips plumped up.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.417
What about the rest?

39:13.484 --> 39:14.485
Because I was with you when you
got your chin and your cheeks,

39:14.552 --> 39:15.786
your forehead and your ass.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.455
I know that you
should shut the ---- up.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.156
I know you are
lying, I was with you.

39:19.223 --> 39:20.458
I watched.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.859
I'm going to talk and
say what I want to say.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.427
Don't lie when I was there.

39:23.494 --> 39:27.164
[talking all at once]

39:27.231 --> 39:30.167
But you attacked me about my
surgery when you got ---- done.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.503
---- that bitch.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.004
My mug shot looks
better than your work.

39:34.071 --> 39:35.072
Whatever, honey.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.974
My mug shot looks
better than your work.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.209
You're a petty ass thief.

39:38.275 --> 39:39.410
No, you're a petty ass bitch.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.245
You're a petty ass bitch.

39:41.312 --> 39:42.580
The only thing I stole was
your ---- and I didn't want him.

39:42.646 --> 39:45.516
Audience: Ooh!

39:45.583 --> 39:49.253
So, Nikki, you're saying Masika
had her surgeries done,

39:49.320 --> 39:50.988
but you've actually been
very complimentary to her.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.656
You called her a pretty girl.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.258
I don't think Masika's
unattractive, no, I don't.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.159
I'm a real bitch.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.227
I don't hate her.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.928
I don't think
she's unattractive.

39:57.995 --> 39:58.929
Just 'cause I don't like her as
a person doesn't mean

39:58.996 --> 40:00.831
she's an ugly bitch.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.533
But you were saying
she looks all ---- up.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.968
That's what you were saying.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.336
I think her lip looks ---- up
because the ---- doesn't move.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.371
And it's like don't try
to attack me about ----.

40:07.438 --> 40:08.506
There's nothing in it.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.274
You weren't born
natural either, you feel me?

40:10.341 --> 40:11.909
So, don't sit
here and talk ----.

40:11.976 --> 40:15.312
You're not born natural like
a ---- masterpiece, bitch.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.114
yes, I am.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.916
And watch the
bitch, watch that bitch.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.785
I'm going to show you what
a masterpiece looks like.

40:20.851 --> 40:25.923
All right, thank you so much.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.493
That's called daddy's credit
card, that's what it's called.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.729
Nikki, baby.

40:31.796 --> 40:35.199
I have heels higher than
your self esteem, so sit down.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.069
So, Fizz, you dated
both Amanda and Nikki.

40:39.136 --> 40:42.106
How do you feel about dating a
woman who has had work done?

40:42.173 --> 40:43.307
It doesn't bother me.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.509
I mean, you know, if
she's comfortable with it,

40:45.576 --> 40:46.844
she's comfortable with it.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.779
All that's important
to me is confidence.

40:48.846 --> 40:51.315
Sincere, what are your thoughts
on women who get work done,

40:51.382 --> 40:52.750
is that just the
Hollywood thing?

40:52.817 --> 40:55.019
It's all a big illusion anyway.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.754
Titties come with
it, ass, whatever.

40:56.821 --> 40:57.888
That's a very good point.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.090
In Hollywood, it's
all a big illusion.

41:00.157 --> 41:01.959
Well, that's all we
have time for tonight.

41:02.026 --> 41:04.862
Thank you for watching "Love and
Hip Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.731
I'm Mona
Scott-Young, good night.

41:07.798 --> 41:16.707
[cheers and applause]

41:16.774 --> 41:24.715
{\an5}â™ª

41:24.782 --> 41:26.817
When you saw her in the car with
the other guy, what did you do?

41:26.884 --> 41:28.919
I kept pushing, I was
like, "This bitch crazy."

41:28.986 --> 41:30.020
That's not what you do.

41:30.087 --> 41:31.355
Was Cameron with you?

41:31.422 --> 41:32.756
No.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.825
Because this is what I was going
to say, hypothetical Cameron

41:34.892 --> 41:38.963
was in the car and
there's Amanda, 305 in my city.

41:39.029 --> 41:42.633
What if he rolls down the window
and says something and old boy

41:42.700 --> 41:46.203
in the car gets ridiculous, then
I have to kill everybody and

41:46.270 --> 41:49.773
it's just bad because then
I'm in jail, my baby's left

41:49.840 --> 41:50.808
with no mom.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.476
He's dead, she's dead.

41:52.543 --> 41:53.544
It's just all bad.
