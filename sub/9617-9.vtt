girl meets world.

00:06.223 --> 00:09.241
Scandal rocks washington today
as jefferson davis graham,

00:09.243 --> 00:13.712
Longtime senator from new york,
did something so
incredibly stupid,

00:13.714 --> 00:18.550
His chance at
re-election is like, zero,

00:18.552 --> 00:21.620
Unless they can somehow pull
an even bigger blockhead out

00:21.622 --> 00:23.255
Of the woods
to run against him.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.923
Face it, we're finished.

00:24.925 --> 00:28.360
There isn't a guy in
the universe couldn't
beat our candidate right now.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.597
Too good, winner.
No, he beats us.

00:31.599 --> 00:35.334
She beats us. Whoa!

00:35.336 --> 00:38.437
Lookee here, chester.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.740
You're welcome, america.

00:45.413 --> 00:48.947
Current events. Somebody tell me
what's going on in the world.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.850
Stuff happened in some country,
some team won a game,

00:51.852 --> 00:54.887
And it's cold somewhere
with a chance of i don't care.
Am i all caught up?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.855
Yeah.
Your education's complete.

00:56.857 --> 01:00.526
Anybody who's gonna turn out
well got something to say?

01:00.528 --> 01:03.996
-Lucas.
-All the news is about
the elections.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.864
So are all of the commercials.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.634
Why should we care
about the elections
when we don't get to vote?

01:08.636 --> 01:11.904
Who else feels that way?
Well, that's a shame, guys,

01:11.906 --> 01:13.939
Because this world's gonna
belong to you soon.

01:13.941 --> 01:17.509
-The one you messed up?
-Yeah, thanks anyway.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.012
Oh, so you got problems with
this planet you're inheriting?

01:20.014 --> 01:23.649
When i read the news, it makes
me feel like this isn't even
a world i'd want to rule.

01:23.651 --> 01:26.485
Wow, farkle. I've never
heard you say anything
like that before.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.254
I'm a visionary, riley.
I look ahead.

01:29.256 --> 01:33.525
You. Me. Mars.
Let's do this thing.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.413
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:37.414 --> 01:40.032
You guys are supposed
to be optimistic.
Future leaders.

01:40.034 --> 01:42.434
You don't get cynical
until high school.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.937
Why don't you elect people
who care enough to make
things better?

01:44.939 --> 01:47.906
I like to think i do
every time i vote.

01:47.908 --> 01:52.277
But the truth is i'm not
responsible for the quality
of people running for office.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.480
How are these people
even chosen?

01:54.482 --> 01:57.616
Well, the parties choose
the best candidates they
can come up with.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.120
(panting)

02:05.960 --> 02:08.427
I am running

02:08.429 --> 02:11.997
Senator
the  <i> grape  </i> state of new york.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.399
And i need your votes.

02:14.401 --> 02:18.070
-Kids don't vote.
-Then uh-oh!

02:18.072 --> 02:20.939
Everybody close your books.
It's the end of the world.

02:20.941 --> 02:25.711
I'm really dizzy.
I've done this in
every classroom.

So they plucked me off
the street and they hustled
me into a limousine

03:27.808 --> 03:31.376
-Like i was fancy.
-Who was in the limousine?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.879
The bow tie man
with the big glasses.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.615
He was a whisperer, right?
He was one of these whisperers.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.483
He came up to me he was like,

03:38.485 --> 03:42.754
"eric, you are the only one
that has a chance to defeat

03:42.756 --> 03:45.591
Senator jefferson davis
graham in the primary!"

03:45.593 --> 03:47.926
That's not a whisper, eric.

03:47.928 --> 03:52.030
I also don't know
what a primary is!

03:52.032 --> 03:55.834
The primary is the first
election where the voters
select each party's candidate.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.036
Oh, that's wrong.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.072
Then the winners
of the primary

04:00.074 --> 04:02.708
Run against each other
in the general election
to see who goes to washington.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.410
Are you a robot?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.913
I'm a real boy.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.716
-Birth certificate?
-Still looking.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.021
Eric, davis graham is
a six-term senator.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.856
Eric, you don't have enough
money to run against him.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.826
Eric, the bow tie man said
he would help me with
all of that.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.828
Eric, you can't beat this guy.

04:22.830 --> 04:27.132
He's done bad things.
People who do bad things
shouldn't be in power.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.533
I want to beat him.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.738
I don't know how he does it,
but tell me you're
not on his side.

04:32.740 --> 04:36.608
Not. Eric, you don't even
have a campaign team.
Who's your team?

04:36.610 --> 04:40.178
Well, that's why i'm here.
I want riley and her friends
to run my campaign.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.116
I mean, tell me you're not
on his side now.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.585
Not. Yet.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.721
Eric, they're kids.
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

04:49.723 --> 04:52.724
Man: It's a great idea.

04:52.726 --> 04:57.229
The senator took money
from schools and gave it
to his rich friends.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.898
Why would he do that?
Who are you?

04:59.900 --> 05:03.835
Because his rich friends
are the ones that got
him elected.

05:04.772 --> 05:08.106
I'm tj. Tj murphy.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.876
So he chose his own future
over ours?

05:10.878 --> 05:14.046
Beat the bad bad man, eric.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.248
I'm gonna do my best, moesha.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.551
How do you know
so much about this?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.753
I'm the one that caught him.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.956
I have a website called
"thorn in your side."

05:24.958 --> 05:26.491
I'm the thorn.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.194
So letting the kids run
eric's campaign--

05:29.196 --> 05:32.197
Would show that eric
would rather build schools.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.900
Would show that he cares about
our future as much as his.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.169
What's your deal,
man with the ideas?

05:37.171 --> 05:40.238
I believe in you.
I'd like to help.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.007
Hmm.

05:42.009 --> 05:46.712
I need to have
a secret meeting with
my team behind closed doors.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.518
What do you think?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.254
Clearly, we need all
the help we can get.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.157
Welcome abroad, pk.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.168
As you are about to see,
we've had our share
of election surprises.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.270
But america loves an underdog.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.574
Matthews, you mind if i stick
around for this class?

06:15.576 --> 06:18.543
Of course, harley.
You're interested in politics?

06:18.545 --> 06:21.279
I'm interested in why school
budgets are being cut.

06:21.281 --> 06:25.050
I'm interested in why they
take away art and music.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.551
You like music?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.854
Without music,

06:28.856 --> 06:31.823
I'd do something.

06:31.825 --> 06:35.160
I know, harley.
I know you would.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.829
Hey, you guys.
We don't need to be afraid.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.031
We can win this thing.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.735
We just need to remember
the wise words of president
f. Doctor oosevelt,

06:43.737 --> 06:47.973
Who said, "the only thing
we have to fear is fear--"

06:47.975 --> 06:50.626
Wow!

06:50.627 --> 06:53.278
Ha ha! This looks
just like harley keiner.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.281
Oh, harley keiner.
Harley keiner.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.818
If i could do my whole
life over again, i would
give that guy such a what-for.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.822
You do. You look a lot
like harley keiner.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.225
You got like the whole
harley keiner head.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.327
The harley keiner face.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.597
It says harley on your shirt.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.366
Oh, this is terrible.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.702
Uncle eric is running
for senator.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.137
Can we count
on your vote?

07:19.139 --> 07:20.739
I don't know.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.607
What are you gonna do
for the little guy?

07:22.609 --> 07:25.210
I never really thought of you
as a little guy, harley.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.680
You know something?
I'm sure this school is
really well taken care of.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.320
What are you doing?

07:35.322 --> 07:36.822
I'm supposed to.

07:36.824 --> 07:41.059
Babies.
You kiss babies, you maroon.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.828
(sighs)

07:42.830 --> 07:46.298
Okay, matthews.
You kiss nice.
You got my vote.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.168
All right, well, hey,
there's one.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.670
Now how many do we need, robot?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.171
-Three million.
-And how many do we have, robot?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.674
-One.
-Now burn me
with your laser eyes.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.943
No, don't.
Okay, do it. Do it.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.079
Let's not. Let's not,
let's not. Okay.

08:01.081 --> 08:05.016
Okay, phew. You know,
we get along really
well, don't we, robot?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.385
Yes, because with you around
i feel really good about myself.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.753
Ha!

08:08.755 --> 08:11.289
Okay, everybody,
up here please.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.894
Cory:
In the 1960
presidential election,

08:15.896 --> 08:20.398
A young senator
from massachusetts was not
expected to beat richard nixon,

08:20.400 --> 08:21.967
The current vice president.

08:21.969 --> 08:25.437
But then they held the very
first televised debate.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.306
And john kennedy, the underdog,

08:28.308 --> 08:32.344
Became the 35th president
of the united states.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.947
That's how powerful
the media is.

08:39.319 --> 08:42.387
-Senator graham.
-Topanga matthews, isn't it?

08:43.323 --> 08:44.990
I never forget a face.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.225
Especially one that
came out against me.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.762
My law firm opposed
the senator's plan to
charge admission to parks

08:50.764 --> 08:53.098
And recreational areas
that were previously free.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.301
A dollar for kids to run around
and play, wasn't it, senator?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.370
It's all about making money
for the state.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.306
At the expense
of our children?

09:01.307 --> 09:04.241
Well, we don't have enough money
and there's so many children.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.412
-That's enough.
-Okay.

09:07.414 --> 09:11.316
Eric, is this bow tie,
big glasses, whisper man?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.051
Um...

09:15.489 --> 09:17.422
Could you say something?

09:17.424 --> 09:19.958
I believe we're here
to discuss the finer points
of the campaign.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.726
This is him.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.328
He works for graham.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.330
No. He likes me.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.399
Oh, i do like you.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.200
Who's running your campaign?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.503
-The children.
-The children. Ha!

09:31.505 --> 09:35.440
-Interesting.
-(clears throat)
yes, interesting.

09:35.442 --> 09:38.877
-I thought you'd like that.
-Murphy.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.780
Wolff.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.415
I'm sorry.
You guys know each other?

09:43.417 --> 09:45.417
Another face
that came out against me.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.186
This guy's a little instigator
who just won't go away.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.789
-Three debates.
-As many as you want.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.525
-One debate.
-One debate.

09:53.527 --> 09:57.462
We have held this office
for three decades.
We will dictate all terms.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.431
I'm sorry.
You work for him?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.399
Sure. Let's go with that.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.468
But you picked me
to run against him.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.403
You said i was the only
one that had a chance.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.539
That's correct.
You are the only one

10:07.541 --> 10:10.976
Who has a chance to make
the senator look good again
in the eyes of the public.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.415
See you at the debate, kids.

10:22.189 --> 10:25.523
They played me.
I'm just supposed to lose.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.092
Supposed to.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.194
-Like kennedy was.
-To nixon.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.262
Yeah, but those guys
weren't real!

10:32.199 --> 10:36.401
I'm done.
I'm going home.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.470
I'm gonna miss you,
scarecrow,

10:38.472 --> 10:41.573
Lion, dorothy.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.442
Robot.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.811
I think i'm gonna miss you
most of all.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.627
Current events.
Somebody tell me
what's going on.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.996
We should always have parks
to play in.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.564
We should always look out
for the little guy.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.299
We should lower the voting age.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.501
We need to treat
this planet better.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.469
I don't want to go to mars.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.272
I want to rule an earth that
has good air and good water.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.007
A good earth for our children.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.976
-Both: Our children?
-I want 11.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.978
Split 'em up however you want.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.946
-How do you want--
-you get 11.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.317
So suddenly you guys are
involved in your world.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.520
It's the only one we've got,
isn't it?

11:28.522 --> 11:32.590
That's true.
So what can do we
to make it better?

11:32.592 --> 11:36.594
-You have the vote.
-Why don't they let us vote?
They don't trust us?

11:36.596 --> 11:38.997
I would vote to make sure
everybody takes care
of each other.

11:38.999 --> 11:43.201
Everybody should have food
and shelter and a warm coat
for the winter.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.502
I approve that message.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.138
Well, i agree with you girls.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.108
And, lucas, you wanna lower
the voting age?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.210
Show us you can be trusted.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.580
Find your issue.
Find your passion.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.515
Because we don't have enough.

11:57.517 --> 12:02.253
In the last election,
the voter turnout was
the lowest in our history.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.623
Change that.
Teach us to care.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.659
Well, how do we do that
if we can't vote?

12:07.661 --> 12:09.360
Find somebody
you know who can.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.031
-Our parents?
-Yeah, your parents.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.000
And we'll listen to you.
You know why?

12:16.002 --> 12:17.502
You love us.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.505
Yeah, we do.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.557
You guys live in an age

12:22.558 --> 12:24.608
Where you can send your message
with just one click.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.679
The media is even
more powerful now.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.647
So have a message.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.083
Because it's your world too.

12:48.935 --> 12:52.570
Uncle eric, it's riley.
You've been sleeping
here all day.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.339
I'm sad.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.508
Eric, it's moesha.
We need you.

12:56.510 --> 12:57.709
So sad.

12:59.513 --> 13:02.113
Did the big bad
political men scare you?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.682
They made me sad.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.484
Well, get up.
We need a voice!

13:06.486 --> 13:08.686
No, not getting up.

13:08.688 --> 13:13.424
And there is nothing you
could do that's gonna make
me possibly get-- oh!

13:13.426 --> 13:15.960
Oh.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.130
That's just
a big chocolatey bowl

13:19.132 --> 13:21.199
Of goodness, isn't it?

13:21.201 --> 13:25.670
<i>♪ get back in the race,</i>
<i>you can put this in your face ♪</i>

13:25.672 --> 13:29.107
No, no, i will not be bought
by your catchy jingle.

13:29.109 --> 13:33.611
<i>♪ get back in the race,</i>
<i>you can put this in your face ♪</i>

13:33.613 --> 13:36.014
Oh, man, now it's gonna be
in my head all day,

13:36.016 --> 13:38.349
You mind witches.
Gimme that.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.000
Oh, that's the stuff.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.636
So you're in?

13:58.638 --> 14:02.173
Hold. Hold.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.475
Hand.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.377
I won't be needing that.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.657
You know, they set us up
to lose, maya.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.726
You know my name?

14:21.728 --> 14:25.029
Of course i know your name.
I like you very much.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.565
Then help me grow up
in a better world.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.033
-How?
-Win.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.403
-You think we can?
-Yeah, i do.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.540
-Why?
-Because we completely
believe in the impossible.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.543
We believe that we can
change the world.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.479
-Why?
-Because we're kids.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.248
Isn't that why you
wanted our help?

14:47.821 --> 14:50.421
Okay. (shouts)

14:54.194 --> 14:56.194
That's my niche.

15:03.136 --> 15:07.071
Well, they went to the woods
and found a blockhead,

15:07.073 --> 15:10.241
But he may be less
of a blockhead
than we thought.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.343
Tonight's senatorial debate
takes place

15:12.345 --> 15:14.612
At john quincy adams
middle school.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.315
This is the idea of
the four eighth-graders
who are the brains

15:17.317 --> 15:21.753
Behind eric matthews,
mayor of st. Upidtown.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.155
Yeah, i know how
it's pronounced.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.160
They say the children
are our future.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.796
Let's hope so.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.771
Okay. First question
to senator graham.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.506
Please identify yourself.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.474
Thank you.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.110
Harley keiner,
head custodian.

15:46.112 --> 15:51.115
I'm proud of my school
and the environment
i help create for my kids.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.789
Aw, really?
Thank you, my kids.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.259
My question is, what are you
gonna do for the little guy?

16:01.261 --> 16:04.228
I have never believed
there are little guys.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.365
I've always believed that all
voters are equal in stature.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.501
I already don't believe you.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.803
What about non-voters?

16:11.805 --> 16:13.604
This election isn't about them.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.306
They'll have elections
of their own soon enough.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.175
Lucas, you're not allowed
to interrupt.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.643
-The senator
has one minute.
-Thank you.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.445
Time.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.847
Mayor matthews, your response?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.549
Of course this election
is about them.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.718
Every election is about them.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.920
We have children and we make
our whole lives about them.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.589
I'm sorry. Hold on a minute.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.792
Did you just say
you had children?

16:34.794 --> 16:38.863
Because you don't actually
have any children of your
own, do you, matthews?

16:38.865 --> 16:43.668
No, i don't. I have
a niche and her brother
who's my cousin auggie!

16:44.938 --> 16:49.407
I have come here to this
fine school to stand in
front of you children,

16:49.409 --> 16:51.642
Even though you do not vote,
because you're too young

16:51.644 --> 16:53.544
To understand what's
important in this world.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.314
Well, we understand that
we want our chance
to get to live in it.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.282
And that's what should be enough
to lower the voting age

16:58.284 --> 17:00.852
So we can get a chance to vote
against people like you.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.621
To vote for whom? Him?

17:03.623 --> 17:07.825
This man-child who doesn't
even have experience
in his biggest issue?

17:07.827 --> 17:09.861
He has not raised children.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.863
Convince me you have
a right to lead them,

17:11.865 --> 17:15.900
And i will concede the future
to you and to them.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.736
You're right.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.905
I don't have the experience
that you have,

17:20.907 --> 17:23.574
But you've been doing this
for a very long time,
senator,

17:23.576 --> 17:26.878
And we don't see anything
getting any better.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.214
And, no, i don't
have kids yet,

17:30.216 --> 17:32.583
But i care about them
very much.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.786
But you can't prove it.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.754
Tj:
But i can.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.257
Excuse me?

17:39.259 --> 17:43.995
My name is tj murphy.
Thomas jonathan murphy.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.330
Eric matthews
knew me once as--

17:46.332 --> 17:47.899
Tommy?

17:47.901 --> 17:50.868
Hi, eric.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.673
Okay, he fakes left.
He shoots.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.609
He scores!
They win the championship!

17:58.611 --> 18:01.379
They win the championship!
They win...

18:01.381 --> 18:05.883
I'm the oldest kid
at st. Mary's. I don't
even fit in my bed anymore.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.919
What do you want me
to do, tommy?

18:07.921 --> 18:11.255
Are you gonna
adopt me or not?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.825
I'm not gonna adopt you.

18:13.827 --> 18:17.261
I don't like you anymore.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.264
I'm sorry to hear that,
tommy.

18:20.266 --> 18:24.969
I'm going to california
to be with people who
care about me.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.945
I'm very mad at you.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.713
I know.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.517
I didn't wanna leave
without saying goodbye.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.859
The best thing eric ever did
for me

18:47.861 --> 18:52.597
Was one of the hardest decisions
he had to make.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.765
He gave me up

18:54.767 --> 18:57.001
To a wonderful family
that raised me,

18:57.003 --> 19:00.972
But i've never forgotten what
i learned from eric, either.

19:00.974 --> 19:05.610
Kindness, honesty and more
respect for human beings

19:05.612 --> 19:07.979
Than i've ever known anyone else
to have.

19:07.981 --> 19:12.950
Eric matthews sacrificed himself
for the future of a child.

19:12.952 --> 19:16.687
You sacrificed the future
of children for yourself,
senator.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.959
So here's my question:
Is there really any choice here?

19:28.034 --> 19:31.102
Man.

19:31.104 --> 19:33.371
Look at you.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.974
You grew up to be
a really good person.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.877
Yeah, i learned
from some really good people.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.881
And now you may applaud.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.362
Well, maybe we don't
have vote, lucas.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.797
Did you just call me
lucas?

19:59.799 --> 20:03.734
I've always known your name.
I like us all very much.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.836
Maybe we do have a voice.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.371
So, what do you want
to say, robot?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.941
You. Me.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.944
Earth.
Let's do this thing.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.660
Eric, what's the first thing
you're going to do if you win?

20:29.662 --> 20:32.563
I'm going to adopt tommy.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.166
Can't. But you can hire me.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.969
I'd like to keep being part
of the campaign,
if it's okay with you.

20:37.971 --> 20:40.638
I was hoping you'd say that.

20:42.141 --> 20:45.810
Guys, did you hear?
Uncle eric could win.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.112
He could be one
of our country's leaders.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.816
-Yeah, we know.
-So where you going?

20:51.818 --> 20:53.150
-Far.
-Far far away.

20:53.152 --> 20:55.486
-As far as we can go.
Good luck to you.
-Bye.
