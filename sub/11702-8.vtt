00:02.485 --> 00:04.765
I tell you, it's a miracle drug.

00:04.885 --> 00:07.085
It stops the blood.
Makes it thicker.

00:07.205 --> 00:09.365
You thinking
about becoming a doctor?

00:09.385 --> 00:11.385
Why not? You're thinking
about becoming a lawyer.

00:11.565 --> 00:14.165
Will! Will, it's Conway!

00:19.765 --> 00:21.485
Can I have my wig back?

00:21.605 --> 00:24.205
If you wanted your wig,
you shouldn't have thrown it away.

00:24.285 --> 00:27.365
Oh, my God, Dors, you're preggers!

00:31.765 --> 00:37.085
She's got vinegar tits!
What's that smell?

00:37.205 --> 00:41.645
It's vinegar. I think it might be
best if you took some time off.

00:41.725 --> 00:43.765
I guess I was wrong about you.

00:43.885 --> 00:47.565
You're just not up to it, are you?
Go home, Vera.

00:47.645 --> 00:50.365
Take care of your mother.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.045
There is a bad stash of
gear coming into the prison.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.205
It's called Pink Dragon.

00:56.325 --> 00:58.765
Soon as it gets here
I'll let you know.

00:58.845 --> 01:01.605
You have an informer in your ranks.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.866 --> 03:23.906
You going to come for breakfast?

03:24.026 --> 03:26.786
You know you can't
stay in here forever.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.386
They all think I'm
still in the slot.

03:31.026 --> 03:36.026
It doesn't look that bad.
It's not about looking bad, Bea.

03:36.106 --> 03:38.746
It's about who I am.

03:38.826 --> 03:40.786
In here.

03:40.866 --> 03:43.026
But no-one wants to see me.

03:43.106 --> 03:46.586
They just keep seeing this man.

03:48.586 --> 03:50.546
Please, Bea.

03:52.186 --> 03:54.826
Please just - just leave me.
Please.

04:53.866 --> 04:55.826
Pick it up.
Huh?

05:08.306 --> 05:09.826
Vinegar Tits.

05:23.786 --> 05:27.146
Vera. Welcome back.

05:27.266 --> 05:28.906
Thank you, Governor. I've spoken to
the contractor and they'll pick up

05:28.986 --> 05:30.786
the garden skip this morning.

05:30.906 --> 05:35.026
Good. And good work with
Maxine Conway, by the way.

05:35.106 --> 05:37.106
Thank you.

05:37.186 --> 05:38.906
You took the right course of action.

05:38.986 --> 05:42.426
Will that be all, Governor?

05:42.546 --> 05:45.066
I need to see Smith.
Right away.

05:45.146 --> 05:48.186
Vera? Condolences.

05:51.306 --> 05:52.946
You've gotta help me.

05:53.066 --> 05:55.986
Whoever's lagging's
getting something for it.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.786
You've gotta check it out.
What are you doing about this?

05:59.866 --> 06:01.306
I'm working on it.

06:05.186 --> 06:09.906
So what are you worried about?
Maybe Nash has forgotten about me.

06:09.986 --> 06:11.626
He's getting out soon.

06:11.706 --> 06:13.906
What if he doesn't contact me?

06:14.026 --> 06:15.706
I won't be able
to tell him about the baby.

06:15.786 --> 06:17.866
Oh, no, he'll be in touch, love.
He will.

06:19.826 --> 06:21.706
None of this would have
happened if there hadn't

06:21.731 --> 06:27.266
have been drugs involved. What?

06:27.386 --> 06:31.626
You know, I keep wondering why
Fletcher came straight to H2.

06:31.746 --> 06:34.106
I'm going up for seconds.
Tell me, Dors.

06:34.226 --> 06:36.466
That garden was a pretty big
privilege.

06:36.546 --> 06:38.906
What'd Ferguson want in return?

06:39.026 --> 06:41.946
You know if I have a problem
with ya, I'll say it to your face.

06:42.066 --> 06:44.666
I might not always like what you do,
Franky, but I'm not a lagger.

06:49.506 --> 06:55.586
We're family, yeah? I can't
believe you'd even think that.

07:01.746 --> 07:04.426
Smith. Governor wants to see you.

07:14.746 --> 07:15.706
Hungry, huh?

07:34.626 --> 07:36.626
Doreen?

07:36.706 --> 07:39.026
Far out!

07:39.106 --> 07:41.706
Don't sneak up on people, man!

07:41.826 --> 07:44.426
You looked like you were
going to throw up back there.

07:44.546 --> 07:48.386
- What do you want?
- I know.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.826
You know what?

07:50.946 --> 07:53.146
It's not the first morning
you've been sick.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.746
And I've been around enough
pregnant girls to know the signs.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.346
Sh!

07:57.426 --> 08:00.146
I won't tell anyone, don't worry.

08:00.266 --> 08:03.386
- You'd better not.
- I just wanna help. If I can.

08:03.466 --> 08:06.066
Why?

08:06.146 --> 08:07.946
I love children.

08:08.026 --> 08:10.986
Here, I have something for you.

08:16.946 --> 08:18.786
It might help settle your tummy.

08:23.826 --> 08:26.986
No, what happened to Simone Slater
was entirely preventable.

08:27.106 --> 08:30.026
And the only reason that
Slater is not here today

08:30.106 --> 08:31.906
is because she had access to drugs.

08:32.025 --> 08:34.785
And you and I both know
where those drugs came from.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.306
I'm not lagging.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.466
I'm not asking you to do that.

08:38.546 --> 08:40.066
Then what do you want?

08:43.866 --> 08:48.546
You know, when all is said and done,

08:48.666 --> 08:51.946
a prison
is controlled by two people.

08:54.026 --> 08:56.346
Two people.

08:56.426 --> 08:59.066
The Governor,

08:59.186 --> 09:03.426
and the inmate who has
the respect of the other prisoners.

09:03.546 --> 09:08.226
I am offering you my support to
help manage the women of Wentworth.

09:08.346 --> 09:11.986
It would be a chance to show
that this prison is safe.

09:12.106 --> 09:14.746
You're asking me to
stand against Franky.

09:14.826 --> 09:17.946
I want you to stand against drugs.

09:18.026 --> 09:19.586
I mean, don't you think that would

09:19.706 --> 09:21.866
be a fitting way to honour
the memory of your daughter?

09:25.226 --> 09:29.066
We're trying very hard to
organise proper housing,

09:29.186 --> 09:31.706
but I have to warn you that
the waiting list is quite long.

09:31.826 --> 09:34.386
Oh, well I mean this place
is hardly the bloody Ritz,

09:34.466 --> 09:36.226
is it, you know.

09:36.346 --> 09:40.106
Now Liz, have you thought any
more about contacting your family?

09:40.226 --> 09:42.666
I'd - I'd actually prefer
to wait until I find my feet.

09:42.786 --> 09:45.706
So look, once I'm settled
somewhere decent, I will.

09:45.826 --> 09:48.906
You know, one of the biggest
mistakes that prisoners make

09:49.026 --> 09:52.706
when they're first released
is to try and go it alone,

09:52.786 --> 09:55.066
to try and find their feet first.

09:55.186 --> 09:58.786
I have to say, reintegration
just doesn't work that way,

09:58.866 --> 10:00.986
especially for an alcoholic.

10:01.106 --> 10:03.186
Yeah, but I've got all
the AA meetings lined up.

10:03.306 --> 10:05.306
And that's good.
Yeah, yeah.

10:05.426 --> 10:09.666
But we do all need help,
Liz, and there is nothing

10:09.746 --> 10:11.826
more important than your children.

10:14.426 --> 10:16.866
Yeah, well they're not
children anymore, are they?

10:16.986 --> 10:20.026
They're teenagers now.
That's exactly right.

10:20.146 --> 10:24.106
And you have every legal right
to contact them.

10:25.706 --> 10:28.946
God, after seven years of silence?

10:29.026 --> 10:30.826
I don't have any rights.

10:30.946 --> 10:34.026
Wouldn't you want to see
your Mum after seven years?

10:36.226 --> 10:40.866
I don't, um, I don't
actually know where they live.

10:45.666 --> 10:48.106
This gives the Department of
Corrections

10:48.226 --> 10:52.826
permission to source
the contact details of your family.

10:52.946 --> 10:55.826
Fill it in and we'll
take it from there.

11:03.666 --> 11:06.746
Ms Dawes said to me that I've got
a natural affinity with the clay.

11:06.826 --> 11:08.626
Alright then, I'll take it.

11:08.746 --> 11:10.946
They could be worth a fortune
one day. What about those?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.506
Do you want those?

11:13.626 --> 11:16.106
Hey,
how'd it go with the parole officer?

11:16.226 --> 11:18.986
Oh, you know, the usual.
Jobs, money, accommodation.

11:19.106 --> 11:21.946
All the terrifying shit
we come in here to avoid.

11:22.066 --> 11:24.746
Franky's mood's making the thought
of leaving a bit easier.

11:24.866 --> 11:26.666
Hey, where is everyone?
Hey, in here.

11:26.746 --> 11:28.786
This place is like a morgue, truth.

11:28.906 --> 11:30.426
Yeah.
Oh, you're packing up.

11:30.506 --> 11:32.066
Yeah, I am.

11:32.146 --> 11:34.466
Hey, can I take this?

11:34.546 --> 11:36.226
Have you got a tea pot?

11:36.346 --> 11:39.866
Nuh. Have you?
Nuh.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.210
Fuck off the lot of you.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.931
Fuck off.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.730
You've gotta get Ferguson
to tell you who it is.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.550
Oh, yeah,
just walk in and ask, you reckon?

12:14.603 --> 12:17.323
Yeah, well why not?
Why don't you just deal with this?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.383
Stop whining and find out who it is.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.944
I'm doing all I can right now.

12:21.065 --> 12:23.865
No more favours till
you've cleaned your house.

12:33.945 --> 12:37.105
Hey. Hi. I got something for you.

12:37.225 --> 12:39.905
A nice wooded chardonnay?
Oh, I wish.

12:42.665 --> 12:45.825
Until your hair grows back.

12:50.105 --> 12:52.265
Was this a tea cosy?

12:54.945 --> 12:57.585
Not anymore.

12:57.665 --> 13:00.585
You serious?

13:00.665 --> 13:02.625
Hey!

13:02.705 --> 13:04.385
Oi.

13:04.505 --> 13:06.345
Girls wanna know if you
got anything for 'em.

13:06.465 --> 13:08.065
Nuh.
Oh, fuck, Franky!

13:08.145 --> 13:10.265
Easy, it's coming.

13:10.385 --> 13:12.785
Yeah, but when?
They're all freakin' out.

13:12.905 --> 13:16.105
I said it's coming.
Be worth the wait.

13:16.185 --> 13:19.625
Is it that pink stuff?

13:19.705 --> 13:22.065
It's even better than that.

13:22.145 --> 13:23.285
Hey listen, the deal's set.

13:23.305 --> 13:26.105
I just need to iron out a few things
before I can green light it.

13:26.225 --> 13:29.905
Well, let me help. No,
you tell the girls it's all good.

13:29.985 --> 13:33.185
They're not gonna wait forever.

13:38.665 --> 13:40.065
Hey! Hey, you alright?

13:40.185 --> 13:41.745
Yeah, I just got
somewhere I need to be.

13:41.770 --> 13:43.970
You sure you're alright?
What the fuck do you mean?

13:45.105 --> 13:47.785
Franky, you know I'm here for you.

13:47.865 --> 13:50.105
As a friend, if you need to talk.

14:01.367 --> 14:03.447
You know you're meant to
look happier after that.

14:09.207 --> 14:10.727
Are you worried about the lagger?

14:12.527 --> 14:14.367
The what?

14:14.487 --> 14:17.767
What's the matter?
Who fuckin' told you that?

14:17.887 --> 14:20.887
Everybody knows about it.
Who's everyone?

14:21.007 --> 14:24.127
The girls in C Block. And what else
are the girls in C Block saying?

14:24.247 --> 14:27.167
Nothing. Just - just-
What are they fuckin' saying?

14:27.247 --> 14:28.847
That you can't move any gear

14:28.967 --> 14:30.807
cos someone in your crew's
lagging to Ferguson.

14:30.832 --> 14:32.367
Oh, this fuckin' place!

14:32.447 --> 14:36.327
Franky, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:36.447 --> 14:38.927
What are you gonna do?
Find 'em.

14:39.047 --> 14:41.047
You reckon it's one
of the girls from H2?

14:41.127 --> 14:43.967
Course not. We're family.

14:44.087 --> 14:46.527
Yeah, well without gear,
everyone's gonna go crazy.

14:46.647 --> 14:48.207
Yeah, I fuckin' know already.
The girls-

14:48.232 --> 14:51.647
I fuckin' know that!
Franky- Fuck off.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.687
I'm just trying to help you.
Franky.

14:53.807 --> 14:55.447
Fuckin' go.
Franky-

14:55.527 --> 14:58.847
Fuck off. Fuck off!

15:26.830 --> 15:30.370
It says here on my application for
a phone that they won't give me

15:30.427 --> 15:33.187
a phone unless I give them a phone
number, which is a bit bloody hard

15:33.267 --> 15:34.827
cos I don't have a bloody phone.

15:34.947 --> 15:37.307
You're gonna have to get a bloody
phone. Yeah, bloody right!

15:37.332 --> 15:39.652
How about you keep the fuck down?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.067
Don't even go there.

15:42.187 --> 15:44.468
Hey, why don't you use one of
your friend's phone numbers?

15:44.548 --> 15:45.828
I don't even need a phone, do I?

15:45.868 --> 15:48.907
I mean, all it's for is so your
boss can hassle you, isn't it?

15:49.027 --> 15:51.947
Liz.
They all want my address, right?

15:52.027 --> 15:54.107
And I don't have an address.

15:54.227 --> 15:56.627
And if you don't have an
address you can't get a flat,

15:56.747 --> 15:59.067
and if you don't have a phone
number you can't get a phone.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.627
If you don't have a life
you can't get a life.

16:01.747 --> 16:04.747
Hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be OK.
What are you meant to do?

16:04.867 --> 16:07.387
It'll be alright, Liz. No, it's
not going to be alright, Dor.

16:07.507 --> 16:09.627
Well Liz, your parole officer will
help you out with all this stuff.

16:09.747 --> 16:10.707
Yeah, but what about
when she's not there?

16:10.787 --> 16:12.547
And what if something goes wrong?

16:12.667 --> 16:16.587
Hey Liz, just listen, OK? Before you
were in here, you managed out there.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.507
Phones, houses.

16:18.587 --> 16:20.387
You can do it all again.

16:20.507 --> 16:23.067
Yeah,
but I wrecked everything last time.

16:28.867 --> 16:34.907
I'm just gonna wreck it all again.
Fuckin' thing.

17:02.987 --> 17:03.947
And it's positive.

17:04.067 --> 17:06.627
Do we know who it belongs to?
No.

17:08.267 --> 17:11.027
I've organised for testing of
all inmates to begin immediately.

17:11.146 --> 17:14.107
To maintain confidentiality I'll
run it as a random drug test.

17:14.186 --> 17:16.946
That's good. Excellent initiative.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.507
We need to find the guilty parties,
quickly and quietly.

17:19.627 --> 17:21.227
Yes, Governor.
Vera, just-

17:21.347 --> 17:22.946
Let's also keep the nature
of these tests

17:22.972 --> 17:25.627
from the other officers for now,
particularly the male ones.

17:25.747 --> 17:27.747
Of course, Governor.
Only medical staff will know.

17:29.347 --> 17:32.667
Vera. Remove that.

17:51.307 --> 17:55.387
Hey, Mr Fletcher.
What do you want, Warner?

17:55.507 --> 18:01.027
Visitors request form.
Seeing your lawyer?

18:01.147 --> 18:02.547
Aha.
Mhmm.

18:05.467 --> 18:11.187
You've got something there.
No, here. It's pen.

18:11.267 --> 18:12.867
You've drawn all over yourself.

18:36.667 --> 18:37.867
Attention compound,

18:37.987 --> 18:41.707
all prisoners in Cell Block G
are to proceed to medical.

18:41.827 --> 18:44.107
Doreen!
Hey.

18:44.187 --> 18:46.267
Did you hear about the urine tests?

18:46.387 --> 18:48.827
Yeah, happens all the time.
Aren't you worried?

18:48.947 --> 18:52.707
Why? Won't they be able to tell
you're pregnant?

18:52.827 --> 18:54.507
Fuck,
I need to get some clean piss.

18:54.587 --> 18:56.187
You can have some of mine. I'm clean.

18:56.267 --> 18:58.147
Alright, come on then.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.347
Warner!
I'll see you when you're done, eh?

19:00.427 --> 19:02.387
I need to speak with you.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.947
Your, ah, new TV's here.
What?

19:15.027 --> 19:17.547
Didn't you report your TV broken?

19:17.667 --> 19:19.667
Yeah.
Then I guess that's your new one.

19:22.307 --> 19:24.547
In this room, mate.

19:24.627 --> 19:27.267
That looks pretty flash.

19:27.347 --> 19:29.267
Whose is that?

19:33.307 --> 19:36.867
Can you please give me some space?
No, get on with it.

19:42.387 --> 19:45.107
I can't go while you're
staring at me like that.

19:45.187 --> 19:46.827
You will eventually.

19:46.907 --> 19:48.947
Why are you picking on me?

19:50.547 --> 19:52.467
I'm not a user.

19:54.787 --> 19:56.507
I'm just about
finished with G Block.

19:56.587 --> 19:58.267
Should I call through for H now?

19:58.387 --> 20:00.787
Can you just hold off on that
call for one minute, Ms Atkins?

20:00.812 --> 20:02.252
Yep.

20:11.787 --> 20:14.427
I want you to test
this one immediately.

20:18.907 --> 20:21.387
You're a piece of work,
aren't you, Warner?

20:21.467 --> 20:23.267
I don't know what you mean.

20:23.387 --> 20:27.307
This sweet, innocent act.
You're not fooling me.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.907
Not for a minute.
I've done nothing wrong.

20:30.987 --> 20:32.907
Ms Bennett.

20:38.107 --> 20:39.707
Get back to your unit.

20:57.542 --> 20:59.662
Come on. Come on.

21:14.154 --> 21:17.634
No, I'm telling ya, Boomer said
it's huge and a flat screen.

21:17.754 --> 21:20.234
Who else has a flat screen
around here, Franky?

21:20.314 --> 21:22.314
Think about it.

21:22.395 --> 21:24.195
She's gotta be the lagger, Franky.

21:24.274 --> 21:25.274
Attention compound,

21:25.395 --> 21:28.675
prisoners from Cell Block H are
to proceed to medical immediately.

21:29.404 --> 21:31.163
Where have you been?
Here.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.244
Oh, thanks so much.
You're a lifesaver.

21:35.084 --> 21:37.164
Come on ladies, you heard
the order. Down to medical.

21:37.218 --> 21:40.098
Come on, fat cheeks!
You're exempt, Warner.

21:40.218 --> 21:43.298
The rest of you, let's go.
Anderson, where are ya?

21:43.418 --> 21:48.618
Yeah, right here.
Hurry up.

21:55.818 --> 21:57.338
That's my tea cosy!
Sh!

21:57.458 --> 22:02.138
Oh, that's, that's good.
Ms Miles.

22:02.258 --> 22:04.818
Why is Jess Warner
exempt from the test?

22:04.938 --> 22:06.618
No idea.
Ms Miles?

22:49.498 --> 22:51.938
I guess we have you to thank
for this round of drug tests.

22:52.058 --> 22:55.258
Is that the one full week
after the last one?

22:55.378 --> 23:00.018
So you Wentworth's new
drug crusader, are you?

23:00.138 --> 23:02.378
Do you disapprove
of random drug tests?

23:02.498 --> 23:04.658
Well it drives the women
batshit and I could do without

23:04.683 --> 23:05.978
that crap again so soon.

23:06.058 --> 23:07.458
Having random drug tests at

23:07.578 --> 23:11.698
regular intervals kinda defeats
the purpose, wouldn't you say?

23:11.818 --> 23:13.578
I know you're craving
Ferguson's approval.

23:13.658 --> 23:15.418
But sicking the SESG

23:15.538 --> 23:20.258
onto fellow officers, it smacks
of desperation, that's not you.

23:23.418 --> 23:27.258
Being vigilant is exactly me.

23:28.538 --> 23:30.818
Vera, I know you've been
through a lot lately.

23:30.938 --> 23:33.378
But have a look at what
Ferguson's doing to you.

23:35.058 --> 23:37.938
What she's doing?
Mhmm.

23:38.058 --> 23:41.218
For four years
I have heard you go on like

23:41.338 --> 23:44.498
a broken record about how the women
have it too easy, how we shouldn't

23:44.618 --> 23:46.899
show them sympathy and now
you're upset about a drug test?

23:46.978 --> 23:51.018
No, I'm upset about why
you're acting this way.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.218
Maybe you should be concerned
about your own behaviour, Fletcher.

23:55.818 --> 23:59.338
Look at yourself. You're a mess.

24:00.978 --> 24:03.738
Stale alcohol on your breath.
That's bullshit. Come on.

24:03.858 --> 24:06.978
Allowing female inmates to
touch you inappropriately.

24:07.058 --> 24:08.578
What?

24:08.658 --> 24:10.578
You heard me.

24:10.698 --> 24:14.338
The next time I see you, or any of
my officers, having inappropriate

24:14.458 --> 24:18.778
physical contact with an inmate,
it is not the SESG I'll be calling.

24:32.524 --> 24:34.624
Smiles. Need more starch.

24:34.703 --> 24:36.868
Alright, Anderson,
come with me to the store room.

24:49.471 --> 24:51.151
Hey Lindsay!
Sarah! What are you doing?

24:51.271 --> 24:56.391
Get off me!
What are you doing? Get off me!

24:58.311 --> 25:00.631
What have you been
talking to the screws about?

25:00.751 --> 25:03.671
What? Simple question. Why have
you been talking to the screws?

25:03.791 --> 25:06.151
I wasn't. Fuck off! I saw you
talking to Bennett.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.151
No, she wanted me to
get her a drug test.

25:08.231 --> 25:09.231
Put her in there.

25:09.311 --> 25:11.791
She's a fuckin' lagger.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.151
Come on!
Tell me what you told Bennett.

25:14.271 --> 25:16.190
She-
Tell me or you're dead.

25:16.191 --> 25:18.631
Franky, look at her.
She's just a kid-
Stay the fuck out of it!

25:18.656 --> 25:19.591
Tell her!

25:19.671 --> 25:22.151
You are losing control, my friend.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.751
Why was she exempt from the drug
test?

25:23.776 --> 25:25.751
You want to catch the lagger, mate,

25:25.871 --> 25:27.311
you're gonna
have to use your smarts.

25:27.336 --> 25:29.656
You can't keep shoving people
in a dryer. This is bullshit.

25:38.551 --> 25:40.511
If I find out anyone,

25:40.631 --> 25:44.511
anyone's been talking to
the screws, you're dead.

26:21.786 --> 26:26.186
You getting nervous?
About what?

26:26.338 --> 26:27.858
About getting out?

26:27.938 --> 26:33.178
Nah. Shittin' myself.

26:35.818 --> 26:39.178
You'll be fine this time.
You reckon?

26:39.298 --> 26:41.698
Yeah.
Mm.

26:41.818 --> 26:44.938
What's out there that's worse
than this shit hole?

26:45.018 --> 26:46.458
That's true.

26:49.563 --> 26:52.883
I know something's up with you.

26:52.963 --> 26:54.843
And it's not just gate fever.

26:56.523 --> 26:58.843
You know you can
still tell me shit, Liz.

27:00.443 --> 27:02.043
No.

27:02.123 --> 27:05.603
No, I'm just nervous, that's all.

27:09.803 --> 27:12.443
Look, what happened that day with
Jess, you've gotta understand-

27:12.563 --> 27:16.003
No, no, Franky, don't.
Np, just listen, just listen.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.843
You were right.

27:17.963 --> 27:20.123
That wasn't smart,
and I've gotta use my head.

27:20.243 --> 27:22.323
Someone's lagging and Boomer
just got a brick for it.

27:22.403 --> 27:25.243
Yeah, well
just stop dealing, Franky.

27:25.323 --> 27:27.083
If you stop the drugs, mate-

27:27.203 --> 27:29.603
You've forgotten what happens
in this place when it runs dry?

27:29.628 --> 27:30.683
Come on.

27:30.803 --> 27:32.243
Yeah, but why
does it have to be you?

27:32.268 --> 27:33.363
Ah, fuck.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.203
You used to hate Jacs for what she

27:35.323 --> 27:37.763
did to the girls and now you're
doing exactly the bloody same.

27:37.843 --> 27:40.843
You know what? If it's not me,
it'll be another Jacs, or worse.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.443
Oh, worse than what happened
to Jess in the laundry?

27:42.563 --> 27:44.163
Fuck, where does
this stuff come from?

27:44.243 --> 27:47.403
It comes from caring, Franky.

27:47.483 --> 27:50.723
I hate seeing you like this.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.323
I hate what you've become.

27:53.403 --> 27:54.843
You know what?

27:54.963 --> 27:59.203
I've become what I had to. And I'm
the one that's gotta live with it.

28:01.443 --> 28:03.323
How about you, Liz?

28:03.443 --> 28:08.243
You all comfortable in there,
are ya? You're guilt fuckin' free.

28:08.843 --> 28:10.283
Fuck off.

28:13.723 --> 28:15.283
Fuck, Franky.

28:20.003 --> 28:21.843
Was it Warner?
I don't know.

28:21.963 --> 28:26.443
Jesus! You have to ask Ferguson.
No fuckin' way.

28:26.563 --> 28:30.123
Hey, maybe you should remember
if I go down, you do too.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.363
Invoices, Governor.

28:46.763 --> 28:48.843
Was there something else, Ms Miles?

28:48.963 --> 28:52.803
Word out is Franky Doyle's
looking for a lagger.

28:52.923 --> 28:55.243
I just
thought if there was someone,

28:55.363 --> 28:56.883
you might want to give them
a heads up.

28:59.443 --> 29:02.483
Do you really think that if
I did have a source of information

29:02.563 --> 29:04.923
among the prisoners,

29:05.003 --> 29:07.563
I wouldn't give 'em a heads up?

29:10.123 --> 29:12.443
No.

29:12.523 --> 29:14.363
Anything else?

29:21.783 --> 29:23.143
Have you finished the tests?

29:23.262 --> 29:26.622
We finished taking samples, but not
testing them. That'll take a while.

29:26.742 --> 29:30.062
Next!
That's my job.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.640
Sorry.

29:31.761 --> 29:34.081
OK.
Hello, Mrs Novak.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.160
Your INR is still too low,
so we've upped your dose again.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.040
I want you to take two
of these red ones, OK?

29:50.415 --> 29:53.135
OK, open up, Marge. Tongue out.

29:53.215 --> 29:55.615
OK. To the left?

29:55.734 --> 30:00.214
No, no, no, your tongue to the left.
What?

30:00.334 --> 30:02.494
Nothing.
Thank you Marge, you can go.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.335
Pst! Hey! Did you get them?

30:12.415 --> 30:13.495
Yes, a cinch.

30:13.615 --> 30:15.896
It wouldn't take much to get
it past those two love birds.

30:15.921 --> 30:17.695
Who?

30:17.775 --> 30:19.535
Mr Jackson and that slut.

30:19.655 --> 30:21.255
Which one?
The nurse.

30:21.375 --> 30:24.375
Really?
Really!

30:24.455 --> 30:27.255
Here, give me the pills.

30:28.975 --> 30:30.695
Don't you forget to
take that one, alright?

30:30.775 --> 30:32.695
I'm not completely mad, dear.

30:39.055 --> 30:40.895
It's lovely!

30:40.975 --> 30:44.735
Thank you.

30:56.495 --> 31:00.015
This is your daughter's phone
number.

31:00.135 --> 31:03.975
Now you need to add it to your
contact list, but it's been cleared

31:04.095 --> 31:08.175
by the department. And if you
have any problems, you let me know.

31:10.215 --> 31:12.655
It's a big first step, Liz.

31:12.735 --> 31:15.455
But it's the right step.

31:17.495 --> 31:20.335
Your chances of staying sober
and making it on the outside,

31:20.455 --> 31:23.015
they go up massively if you
have your family's support.

31:42.655 --> 31:44.255
Governor, can I have a word please?

31:53.055 --> 31:54.935
Do you really
think you can bribe me?

31:55.055 --> 31:57.135
Sorry?
The television.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.735
You didn't request a new television?

31:59.855 --> 32:02.295
Perhaps you're reading a
little too much into it, hmm?

32:02.415 --> 32:05.695
Oh, yeah, me and everyone else.
Doesn't exactly look good.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.655
But I guess that's
your plan, right?

32:15.175 --> 32:17.575
How long did you allow your
husband to beat you before you

32:17.655 --> 32:19.095
decided to make a stand?

32:25.895 --> 32:29.775
If you don't want a new television,
don't ask for one.

33:18.427 --> 33:19.867
Let's go.

33:22.238 --> 33:25.738
Hey, it's on.
Oh, thank God.

33:25.807 --> 33:28.967
When? Tomorrow. It's coming in
with the laundry.

33:29.087 --> 33:30.087
Ferguson
won't think to look there twice.

33:30.207 --> 33:31.687
Yeah, I'll tell the girls.
Yeah.

33:31.807 --> 33:34.407
OK. Now, one of the bags,
it's got a mark on it, right?

33:34.527 --> 33:36.927
I want you to spot it,
push it off the conveyor

33:37.047 --> 33:38.207
and leave it on the floor
underneath.

33:38.327 --> 33:40.207
Right, Franky. Don't fuck this up.
Nah, Franky.

33:40.327 --> 33:41.327
OK, piss off.
Yes, Franky.

34:46.367 --> 34:48.607
Alright, everyone, stop
what you're doing now.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.087
Mr Fletcher.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.807
Move!

35:21.207 --> 35:25.487
You lose something, Ms Ferguson?
Sense of humour, maybe?

35:47.527 --> 35:50.567
Check everything. Tear the place
apart if you have to.

35:50.647 --> 35:51.887
Yes, Governor.

35:51.967 --> 35:53.527
Mr Jackson.

35:53.647 --> 35:56.247
Alright, everyone,
up against the wall, please.

35:56.327 --> 35:58.127
Up against the wall, please.

35:59.767 --> 36:01.527
Now!

36:04.887 --> 36:07.607
What do you want?

36:07.727 --> 36:09.887
You fuckin' lagged.
What are you talking about?

36:15.807 --> 36:18.407
You should have done it right
the first time.

36:18.487 --> 36:24.007
What are you doing? No! No!

36:24.569 --> 36:26.009
Hey, have you seen-
Piss off, Liz!

36:26.129 --> 36:28.929
What the fuck's going on here?
Get out! Bea!

36:29.050 --> 36:34.730
Get the fuck out of here, Liz.
Fuck off.

36:34.810 --> 36:36.610
What are you doing this for?

36:36.729 --> 36:39.649
Why are you doing it?
Why are you doing it?

36:39.769 --> 36:42.649
What are you doing it for?
Because she told Ferguson.

36:42.769 --> 36:44.929
Bullshit. She didn't tell Ferguson.
Franky. Franky!

36:45.049 --> 36:47.249
Yes, she did. I set her up
and she walked right into it.

36:47.369 --> 36:49.049
It was me!
It's got nothing to do with you.

36:49.074 --> 36:52.289
I heard you talking in the friggin'
stairwell, Franky. It was me.

36:52.409 --> 36:58.689
Right? It was me.
I did it. It was me.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.931
Liz, what are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

37:05.931 --> 37:06.971
You don't have to do this-

37:07.029 --> 37:11.024
No, it's the truth and I can't stand
watching anyone else cop the blame.

37:12.297 --> 37:13.766
You cunt.

37:18.007 --> 37:21.847
Get out. Get out. All of ya.

37:23.847 --> 37:26.767
It's alright. It's alright.
Get out!

37:52.620 --> 37:53.660
Why?

37:59.060 --> 38:00.500
It was the pink stuff.

38:00.619 --> 38:03.957
I couldn't stand watching
you sell it,

38:03.958 --> 38:06.558
and I couldn't stand
watching someone else die.

38:06.651 --> 38:10.111
I don't give a shit about
the fuckin' drugs, Liz.

38:10.239 --> 38:13.719
It's me. Me.

38:13.799 --> 38:15.439
You lagged on me.

38:21.919 --> 38:24.999
I thought we were family.

38:25.119 --> 38:28.359
You're a pain in the arse
but you gave a shit about me.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.879
I'd never had that before.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.599
Ever.

38:37.199 --> 38:40.199
I trusted you.
Fuck, Franky-

38:40.319 --> 38:42.879
Nuh.
Don't touch me, don't talk to me.

38:45.719 --> 38:47.159
Just leave me alone.

38:52.759 --> 38:59.039
If you ever come back to Wentworth,
I will kill you myself.

39:45.637 --> 39:48.197
I want to go into protection.

39:49.660 --> 39:51.460
Have there been repercussions?

39:51.468 --> 39:53.428
No. No, it's not that.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.747
I just wanna go.

40:00.027 --> 40:02.827
Well, I'm certainly
not going to stop you.

40:05.348 --> 40:07.388
Have you managed to speak
with your family,

40:07.507 --> 40:10.107
to make arrangements for your
release?

40:10.187 --> 40:11.747
No, I tried.

40:11.827 --> 40:14.467
The phone queues were too long.

40:18.867 --> 40:24.987
Well, one good turn
deserves another.

40:33.547 --> 40:36.067
Sorry?
It's your daughter's mobile number.

40:36.147 --> 40:39.107
I'll give you some privacy.

40:49.947 --> 40:53.107
We finished the pregnancy
tests, Governor.

40:53.187 --> 40:55.107
And?

40:55.187 --> 40:57.467
All negative.

40:57.587 --> 40:59.467
Has there been a mistake,
do you think?

40:59.547 --> 41:01.027
I think we've been had.

41:01.147 --> 41:03.027
Twenty years in this job
and I'm still amazed

41:03.107 --> 41:05.947
at the ingenuity of prisoners.

41:06.067 --> 41:09.347
I'd like to run a second test
on the samples at the lab.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.987
We might as well do a drug screen,
having gone to the trouble of

41:12.012 --> 41:14.347
collecting a prison-wide sample.
Very well.

41:14.427 --> 41:16.667
Just wait one moment, please.

41:18.787 --> 41:22.667
Yeah, I know, love, I know, but-
OK, I've gotta go,

41:22.747 --> 41:24.227
so I'll speak to you soon.

41:24.307 --> 41:25.747
Yep.

41:30.427 --> 41:31.867
Everything alright?

41:31.947 --> 41:33.427
Yeah, thanks.

41:35.707 --> 41:41.947
Ms Bennett? Please escort
Ms Birdsworth to Protection

41:42.067 --> 41:43.507
and see
her belongings are sent over.

41:43.587 --> 41:46.867
Yes, Governor. Birdsworth.

42:02.347 --> 42:05.307
At the third stroke,

42:05.387 --> 42:08.227
it will be six-

42:08.307 --> 42:10.507
Why would she do it?

42:12.787 --> 42:15.387
I should never have told
her about the Pink Dragon.

42:15.467 --> 42:17.467
No, it's not your fault.

42:17.547 --> 42:20.307
Liz did what she had to do.

42:20.427 --> 42:24.067
What's gonna happen
now she's gone, eh?

42:24.187 --> 42:26.507
I'm afraid about Franky
and what she'll do.

42:26.627 --> 42:29.667
Well, how will we stop her?
You can't.

42:29.787 --> 42:33.347
Cos you'll just end up dead
or in hospital.

42:37.867 --> 42:43.427
What is it?
Um, nothing. Never mind.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.147
You know, from the very
first day I've been in here,

42:50.267 --> 42:51.867
everyone thought
that I wanted something.

42:51.892 --> 42:53.932
To be in charge. Power.

42:56.107 --> 43:02.187
So, they bashed me and manipulated
me. They pushed me around and they

43:02.307 --> 43:05.547
killed my daughter,
and I don't know why.

43:05.627 --> 43:07.227
I never asked for anything.

43:09.467 --> 43:11.227
But maybe it's time I did.

43:13.947 --> 43:15.907
So, if they're going
to keep pushing me,

43:17.547 --> 43:19.667
then I think it's time
I pushed right back.

43:31.347 --> 43:34.307
Good to go?
What the hell is this?

43:34.387 --> 43:35.907
It's your helmet.

43:36.027 --> 43:39.587
That's huge.
Well that's for your huge head.

43:39.667 --> 43:43.147
Ah, I mean your huge bun.

43:43.267 --> 43:45.667
My what?
I don't wanna ruin the bun.
