00:01.001 --> 00:02.670
**

00:03.837 --> 00:05.973
Anyway, I do love women
very much.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.842
One thing I love about
women is that they, um...

00:08.876 --> 00:10.211
You have to do this when
you're talking about

00:10.244 --> 00:11.745
how much you love them.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.147
Just...

00:13.181 --> 00:15.083
I just love them.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.750
Mmm!

00:16.784 --> 00:19.187
Love women.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.921
* Mm-hmm-hmm *

00:20.954 --> 00:22.923
Anyway,
I do, I...

00:22.956 --> 00:24.725
I...

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
I...

00:26.794 --> 00:29.029
I love women because...

00:29.063 --> 00:31.332
I mean, women are
the same as men in some ways

00:31.365 --> 00:33.667
but they're better at...

00:33.701 --> 00:36.504
rejecting us
than we are, you know?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.272
They have the skills,

00:38.306 --> 00:41.842
you know, to reject men
in a way

00:41.875 --> 00:43.844
that we can
then not kill them.

00:43.877 --> 00:44.945
That's basically
how that works.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.714
But, uh...

00:46.747 --> 00:48.849
like I saw this couple
once on a date, they're walking,

00:48.882 --> 00:50.351
and then they stop--

00:50.384 --> 00:52.186
The guy stopped her to talk in
the middle of--

00:52.220 --> 00:53.387
Like, "Hey."

00:53.421 --> 00:55.189
And she's like,
"Oh, shit."

00:55.223 --> 00:56.724
So he goes to kiss her

00:56.757 --> 00:58.226
and she does an amazing thing
that women

00:58.259 --> 00:59.860
somehow learn how to do.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.862
She hugged him
very warmly,

01:01.895 --> 01:03.697
and men think
that this is--

01:03.731 --> 01:07.401
this is affection, but what this
is is a boxing maneuver,

01:07.435 --> 01:08.769
because your whole--

01:08.802 --> 01:10.304
"Don't kiss me,
you piece of shit."

01:10.338 --> 01:12.906
And he's trying to get
distance and...

01:12.940 --> 01:15.376
It's not gonna happen.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.745
Thanks a lot, you guys,
you've been very nice.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.079
Good night!

01:19.113 --> 01:21.215
(cheers and applause)

01:21.249 --> 01:22.750
**

01:25.353 --> 01:27.488
Another hand
for Louie C.K.!

01:27.521 --> 01:28.722
(cheers and applause)

01:28.756 --> 01:32.760
And the Grambling Tigers
Marching Band...

01:32.793 --> 01:34.962
who you can't see unless
you have special glasses.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.466
I'll talk to him,
but he's drunk.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.802
Hey.
Hey.

01:41.835 --> 01:42.903
Good set.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.306
Thank you, thank you.
Yeah.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.241
Vanessa.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.776
It's okay.
Oh-- no, I'm sorry.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.344
I've only been working
here for ten years.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.413
It's cool.
I'm sorry.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.483
I'm just kidding,
I just started last week.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.785
You got me.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.687
Seriously,
I like watching you,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.422
and I do not
like comedy.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.490
You don't?

02:02.523 --> 02:03.924
No, I hate it.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.093
I just get nervous
for the guy, you know?

02:06.126 --> 02:08.262
Some of us are
girls up there.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.097
Yeah, same thing.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.665
Yeah, I don't like it.
Don't like comedy?

02:11.699 --> 02:12.966
No, I hate comedy,
yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.102
This is a weird job
for you, then.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.671
Well, in this economy,
no job is weird.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.307
I-- I guess so.
Yeah.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.777
Married
or living together?

02:23.811 --> 02:24.812
(man)
Living together.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.180
Nice.
Doing it?

02:28.349 --> 02:29.517
Really, though, I--

02:29.550 --> 02:30.818
I like watching you
up there.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.186
Thank you.
Yeah.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.158
Um...

02:38.192 --> 02:40.160
Hey, what are you--
what are you doing later?

02:42.230 --> 02:44.365
What?

02:44.398 --> 02:47.335
I get off in an hour,
you want to hang out?

02:47.368 --> 02:48.969
You--

02:49.002 --> 02:51.004
Are you scared that
I'm asking you out?

02:51.038 --> 02:52.840
'Cause I am.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.141
You're cute,
you're funny.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.376
I am both of those,

02:55.409 --> 02:58.346
plus like...
seven other things.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.747
Seven?
Yeah.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.715
Wow.
Come on.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.684
Come out with me,
don't say no.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.752
No is stupid.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.720
No is for queers.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.923
Well, you know,
the thing is that I'm--

03:09.957 --> 03:12.993
I think I'm just
tired.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.194
Oh, my God.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.696
Are you gonna
be okay?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.365
You should have said
something before, man.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.799
I didn't know you
were tired.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.736
You-- you better go
and get a nappy then.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.908
(crowd laughing)

03:29.076 --> 03:30.444
I'm stupid, I had--

03:30.478 --> 03:32.813
I was-- I was dropped on
my head as a child.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.850
Oh my God.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.118
It's brutal out here.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.119
God.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.554
Bro, bro, bro.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.256
Behind you, behind you,
behind you, bro.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.859
Oh, come on.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.227
Oh, God!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.265
I can't take this shit
out here anymore, man.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.234
Mmm.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.970
Bro... we need to
lose some weight.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.040
Don't look at me
like that.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.275
We need to
lose some weight.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.278
I-- I know.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.715
Well, you want to try?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.417
Yeah.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.784
Yeah, I do.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.955
All right, all right.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.056
This is what
we're gonna do.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.391
Tomorrow, we hit
the gym.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.293
We eat kale, right?

04:19.327 --> 04:20.894
Okay.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.298
Today, we gotta
say goodbye to all that.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.800
Yeah, okay.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.072
So bang-bang, right?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.307
Bang-bang now?

04:33.341 --> 04:34.842
Yeah, this is
our last one.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.679
All right,
bang-bang what?

04:38.712 --> 04:39.980
Mexican-Italian.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.817
All right,
sushi-pizza?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.687
Barbecue-IHOP?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.121
Oh, God.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.458
Yeah.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.759
Okay, how about--

04:51.792 --> 04:54.094
how about
Indian-diner?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.262
Done.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.464
All right, all right,
let's go.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.831
Bang-bang?
Bang-bang.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.834
**

05:14.181 --> 05:15.315
Oh, okay.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.996
The puffy bread.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.197
Oh!

05:42.376 --> 05:43.511
Make sandwiches
out of everything.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.890
(belching)

05:57.958 --> 05:59.092
Thank you.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.111
And here is your pie.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.713
Can I get anything
else for you guys?

06:19.747 --> 06:22.182
No, I think
we're good.
No, thank you.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.052
Excuse me,
are you a comedian?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.554
Yeah, yeah.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.788
I thought so.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.190
You're really funny.
Oh, thank you.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.892
Thanks a lot.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.427
You guys
celebrating something?

06:33.461 --> 06:35.696
It looks like you're having
a special occasion.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.864
No, no, we're just--

06:36.897 --> 06:38.732
We're doing
a bang-bang.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.700
What's a bang-bang?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.435
No, it's not--

06:41.469 --> 06:43.737
That's where we go have
a whole meal at one place

06:43.771 --> 06:45.105
and then go right to
another place

06:45.138 --> 06:46.206
and have another one.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.775
Bang-bang.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.043
It's, uh-- just ate a ton
of food at this

06:50.077 --> 06:52.379
Indian place, now this.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.781
Bang-bang.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.917
Bang-bang.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.719
Well, um...

06:58.752 --> 06:59.787
enjoy your meal, guys.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.628
Why would you--
what's wrong with you?

07:07.661 --> 07:09.930
Why would you tell
her that?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.765
'Cause that's
what we're doing.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.800
That's the truth.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.807
That was brutal.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.841
(sighing)

07:22.309 --> 07:25.245
So the gym tomorrow?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.080
You know what?
I got a...

07:27.114 --> 07:28.949
I got a whole bunch of...

07:28.982 --> 07:30.784
I got stuff to do,
I don't think it's a good--

07:30.818 --> 07:32.152
It's not a good day.
Cool.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.859
(horn honking)

07:47.501 --> 07:49.269
(Vanessa)
I wouldn't
recommend the sangria,

07:49.302 --> 07:50.804
only because it's so delicious,

07:50.838 --> 07:52.472
you'll probably end up
having lots of

07:52.506 --> 07:54.307
sex with each other.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.377
There'll be some
scissor fest action here.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.612
Oh, nice.

07:58.646 --> 08:02.015
Some sword-dong fighting
and this action.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.684
It's an intimidating city,

08:03.717 --> 08:04.718
'cause I feel like
everybody here

08:04.752 --> 08:06.019
is better dressed than I am.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.721
Like every time I leave
the house,

08:07.755 --> 08:10.357
it's picture day
and nobody said anything to me,

08:10.390 --> 08:12.459
which is-- is painful,

08:12.492 --> 08:13.727
because when I was
in third grade,

08:13.761 --> 08:15.028
I missed picture day

08:15.062 --> 08:16.864
because my single dad
forgot about it.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.532
Hey, is your-- is your
name really Sunshine?

08:18.566 --> 08:21.134
What?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.936
I was just wondering--
Are you asking
me my name?

08:24.437 --> 08:26.106
What's your name?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.412
Hey.
Hey.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.014
You on next?
Yeah.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.482
If I were you,
I would stay away from

08:35.515 --> 08:36.684
that left front table.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.151
Very belligerent,
dangerous,

08:38.185 --> 08:40.588
perhaps criminally,
type of guys.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.056
Really?
Yeah.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.425
Well, thank you,
I appreciate that.
Sure.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.627
You want to
go out with me?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.097
No.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.398
Cool.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.400
Just being
a little persistent,

08:53.433 --> 08:55.035
'cause I'm into you.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.270
I'm that kind of
chick.
(laughing)

08:57.304 --> 08:58.405
That's my Brando.
(man)
Excuse me?

08:58.438 --> 08:59.439
It was good, right?
Excuse me?

08:59.472 --> 09:00.608
Yeah.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.842
We've been waiting
for our check.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.510
Oh, I'm not
your waitress,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.946
but let's go find her
and kick her ass, come on.

09:05.979 --> 09:06.980
Yuck.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.884
**

09:15.088 --> 09:18.125
Hey, buddy,
what's going on?
What's up?

09:18.158 --> 09:20.293
You going on?
Yeah, I'm after
Greer Barnes.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.562
Greer Barnes.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.064
Greer Barnes.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.532
Let me tell you
something about Greer.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.634
I can't follow
that dude.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.201
Good luck, all right?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.137
Hey.
Hey, Vanessa!

09:30.170 --> 09:31.138
What's happening,
honey?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.707
Um, I just quit.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.475
You did,
seriously?
Yeah.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.377
Oh, wow,
what happened?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.479
Nothing, I just
got a better job, so...

09:39.512 --> 09:40.748
Where?

09:40.781 --> 09:42.716
This part-time
legal office.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.151
Yeah, I was--
I was part-time,

09:44.184 --> 09:46.119
but now they made me
full-time, so...

09:46.153 --> 09:47.387
Wow, that's great.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.789
Hey, shit,
we'll miss you.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.123
Oh, I'll miss you
too, Dave.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.258
Good luck, sweetie.
Thanks, babe.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.260
See you, man.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.496
Hey.
Hey.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.632
That's great about
the job, good for you.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.101
Do you like hockey?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.269
What?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.937
It's okay.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.505
It's okay, I'm not
asking you out again.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.808
I know that's what
that felt like.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.810
I'm-- this is moving.
Okay.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.112
This is going down
into my pocket.
Okay.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.580
All right.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.482
No problem,
we're all relaxed.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.584
Uh-huh.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.519
It's a pair of
tickets.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.487
Behind the net.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.423
Face value, a lot.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.992
The Rangers-Bruins game
on Wednesday.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.794
It's the playoffs.
It's the playoffs.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.129
I want to kill myself,
I can't go.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.163
But I can't go.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.865
So, um...

10:31.899 --> 10:33.600
What are you gonna--
Here.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.968
You want 'em?

10:35.002 --> 10:36.003
You're giving--

10:36.036 --> 10:38.638
You want to
give me those?

10:38.672 --> 10:40.473
You can sell those for
a lot of money.

10:40.507 --> 10:43.610
Yeah, I thought
about it, but, um...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.612
Why...

10:45.645 --> 10:49.616
That's like handing me
1,200 amazing dollars.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.152
Would you like
1,200 amazing dollars?
Of fun and...

10:52.185 --> 10:55.155
Why would you--
why would you do that?

10:55.188 --> 10:58.491
Well...
I like you.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.794
I'm leaving and...

11:00.828 --> 11:02.629
I won't
see you again.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.664
So I don't know.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.166
Makes me feel good
to do something nice

11:06.199 --> 11:08.168
for someone I like.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.704
So... do you
want 'em?

11:10.738 --> 11:12.339
Yes, I really do.
Yeah.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.373
I really--

11:13.406 --> 11:14.474
Thank you.
Cool.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.710
Thank you, I don't--

11:16.744 --> 11:18.378
That's a--
that's it, I'm--

11:18.411 --> 11:19.679
Have a good life.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.414
Okay?
Okay, I--

11:22.883 --> 11:24.584
Hey.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.723
Why don't we...

11:29.757 --> 11:31.725
What if we get some-- what if
we get some coffee sometime?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.160
What if we--

11:33.193 --> 11:35.528
You want to get
some coffee sometime?

11:35.562 --> 11:37.765
Only if it's definitely
a date and not as friends.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.535
I'm kidding.
Jesus.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.904
I'm kidding.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.372
I'd love to
have some coffee.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.339
Yeah?
Tomorrow.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.540
Okay, tomorrow, I can.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.042
You want to meet at
Friedman's?

11:49.076 --> 11:50.844
Yes, I know where that is,
yeah, I can do that.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.179
How about 2:00-ish?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.747
2:00-ish is good.
It's good?

11:53.781 --> 11:55.548
That sounds nice.
All right.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.583
Yeah, I'll see you there.
I gotta--
I gotta go down.

11:56.616 --> 11:57.751
Okay, yeah.

11:57.785 --> 11:58.886
Thank you.
Yeah.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.387
That's awesome.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.621
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.092
* Mm-mm-mm *

12:11.631 --> 12:13.600
Finally, he dies.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.768
I'm being mean--
I love my dad--

12:14.802 --> 12:17.070
but the day he left,

12:17.104 --> 12:19.973
closed up the shop,
got the hell out of there

12:20.007 --> 12:22.910
and I started law school
when I was like 28.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.245
So you just
broke your promise

12:25.278 --> 12:27.714
to the dying man
like that?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.617
See, here's the thing
about dead people.

12:30.650 --> 12:31.919
They're dead.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.620
They don't matter
anymore.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.055
Right.
Yeah.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.289
Wow.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.757
Your parents
still around?

12:37.791 --> 12:39.092
Yeah, yeah.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.660
I never lost
anybody to--

12:40.693 --> 12:42.429
Not to dying.
Really, nobody?

12:42.462 --> 12:43.763
Yeah, nobody--

12:43.797 --> 12:45.765
Well, my great-grandparents
are all dead,

12:45.799 --> 12:47.267
all eight of them.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.635
Wow.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.971
Yeah, they actually
died on the same day.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.139
(chuckling)

12:52.172 --> 12:53.640
They were--

12:53.673 --> 12:55.608
Okay, four of them
were on a plane...
Uh-huh.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.011
... and they crashed
into the other four,

12:58.045 --> 12:59.947
who were in a helicopter.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.149
Wow, it was just
like a freak accident.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.817
No, no,
they planned it.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.155
Ahh!
(woman)
Oh!

13:08.188 --> 13:09.156
Damn.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.723
(woman)
Whoa!

13:12.659 --> 13:14.327
I used to play--
I used to, when I was a kid,

13:14.361 --> 13:16.596
play street hockey,
but I was not--

13:16.629 --> 13:18.131
I was not skilled
like these people.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.499
Yeah.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.035
I got my period
when I was nine.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.004
Jesus Christ.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.305
Come on, let's go.
Okay.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.539
Let's get it going.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.641
So when I moved here,
it was--

13:28.675 --> 13:30.643
it was
really hard, you know?

13:30.677 --> 13:31.979
I was really scared,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.681
I didn't know what
I was doing and...

13:34.714 --> 13:35.682
Uh...

13:35.715 --> 13:36.984
But you did it.

13:37.017 --> 13:37.985
Yeah.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.386
No, I mean, you did it.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.854
You relocated to
New York City on your own.

13:40.888 --> 13:41.989
Yeah.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.156
That's huge.
Yeah.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.291
Thanks, yeah.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.959
I mean, you know,
I got--

13:45.993 --> 13:47.861
I have two kids
and they're both girls.
Right.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.531
And because they're girls,

13:51.564 --> 13:53.000
I need them to have
those basic skills,

13:53.033 --> 13:54.501
like that's what
I feel is...
Yeah.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.637
... the most important thing
for me to pass on to them.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.672
If I did
my job as a father,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.542
it means that they can
move to a town,

14:02.575 --> 14:04.011
just in a day

14:04.044 --> 14:06.513
and get a bank account
and an apartment

14:06.546 --> 14:09.016
and a job
and set themselves up.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.717
And they've left their
other town

14:10.750 --> 14:13.086
because there was
like a crime spree.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.721
Yeah, they murdered
a lot--
Too many dead bodies.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.523
Too many people.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.558
That's what I tell
my girls all the time.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.060
Always be prepared to
bleach your hair

14:20.093 --> 14:22.896
and change your name
and start over again.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.264
I think that's the way
you live a life.
Oh.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.566
What's the matter?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.068
I got a penny.
All right.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.570
Good luck for me,
not for you, sorry.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.505
Why good luck for you?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.907
"See a penny,
face heads up,

14:33.941 --> 14:36.243
all day long you'll
have good luck."

14:36.276 --> 14:38.678
Well, 'cause it rhymes
that's supposed to be true?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.447
'Cause it rhymes?
Yeah.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.681
"See a penny, pick it up,
all day long

14:41.714 --> 14:42.615
you'll have
good luck."

14:42.649 --> 14:43.716
You make up a rhyme.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.684
Make up a rhyme?
Yeah.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.885
(Louie)
All right.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.754
Um...

14:47.787 --> 14:52.859
If you see a dog
with a fuzzy face...

14:52.892 --> 14:55.462
you'll never go to
outer space.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.097
Is that true?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.598
Tell me that's
not true.
Yeah, it's sad.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.267
It's sad, isn't it?
Oh, really sad.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.602
No astronaut
ever saw a dog.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.004
With a furry face.
It's a known...

15:07.607 --> 15:10.277
If they didn't
call it "dating," you know?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.245
Something about the word
"dating,"

15:12.279 --> 15:14.214
it makes it
worse for me.
Yeah?

15:14.247 --> 15:15.448
What would you call it?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.219
"Trying," maybe?
Like, try--

15:19.252 --> 15:21.588
"I've been
trying this girl."

15:21.621 --> 15:24.224
"I'm going out on a try
with this--

15:24.257 --> 15:26.393
with this dude."

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261
Everybody's just trying.
Yeah.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.662
Not bad.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.731
I mean, I would still--
I would still hate it.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.665
Well...

15:32.699 --> 15:34.067
But...

15:34.101 --> 15:35.235
Try dating in New York
in your late 30s

15:35.268 --> 15:37.770
as a fat girl.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.771
Well, you're not--

15:38.805 --> 15:41.341
I mean--
Don't.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.276
You're not fat.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.477
Oh, dammit.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.648
That is so goddamn
disappointing, Louie.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.584
You-- you're--
no, you're not.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.585
You're not, I mean--

15:52.619 --> 15:54.421
Louie.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.123
Do you know what
the meanest thing is

15:56.156 --> 15:58.325
you can say to
a fat girl?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.160
"You're not fat."

16:00.193 --> 16:02.195
I mean,
come on, buddy.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.700
I'm sorry.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.474
It just sucks.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.210
Oh, it really,
really sucks.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.446
You have no idea.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.813
And the worst
part is,

16:20.847 --> 16:23.616
I'm not even
supposed to do this.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.285
Do what?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.520
Tell anyone
how bad it sucks,

16:27.554 --> 16:30.290
because it's too much
for people.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.458
I mean, you,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.526
you can talk into
the microphone

16:33.560 --> 16:35.295
and say you
can't get a date,

16:35.328 --> 16:38.165
you're overweight,
and it's adorable.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.233
But if I say it,

16:40.267 --> 16:43.503
they call the suicide
hotline on me.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.238
I mean,
can I just say it?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.841
I'm fat.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.543
It sucks to be
a fat girl.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.180
Can people
just let me say it?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.184
It sucks!

16:57.217 --> 16:58.885
It really sucks.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.656
And I'm gonna go ahead
and say it,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.592
it's your fault.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.544
Look.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.447
I really like you.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.250
You're truly
a good guy, I think.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.252
So sorry.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.287
I'm picking you.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.889
On behalf of all
the fat girls,

17:36.923 --> 17:39.759
I'm making you
represent all the guys.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.964
Why do you hate us
so much?

17:47.234 --> 17:48.701
What is it about

17:48.735 --> 17:52.071
the basics of
human happiness, you know?

17:52.105 --> 17:54.974
Feeling attractive,
feeling loved?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.443
Having guys chase after us,

17:56.476 --> 18:00.580
that's just not in
the cards for us.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.748
Nope, not for us.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.823
How is that fair?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.727
And why am I supposed to
just accept it?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.796
You know, Vanessa,

18:16.829 --> 18:21.601
you're a very,
really beautiful...

18:21.634 --> 18:23.736
Come on.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.940
If I was a "very,
really beautiful,"

18:27.974 --> 18:30.410
then you would have said yes
when I asked you out.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.412
I mean,
come on, Louie.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.447
Be honest here.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.295
You know what's funny?

18:48.328 --> 18:51.431
I flirt with guys
all the time.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.300
And I mean,
the great-looking ones,

18:53.333 --> 18:57.136
like the really high-caliber
studs...

18:57.170 --> 19:00.640
they flirt
right back, no problem.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.809
Because they know
their status

19:02.842 --> 19:04.143
will never be questioned,

19:04.177 --> 19:08.281
but guys like you
never flirt with me,

19:08.315 --> 19:10.450
because you get scared that

19:10.483 --> 19:14.153
maybe you should be
with a girl like me.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.688
And why not?

19:23.830 --> 19:26.333
You know...

19:26.366 --> 19:29.135
if you were
standing over there...

19:29.168 --> 19:31.304
looking at us,

19:31.338 --> 19:33.373
you know what
you'd see?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.141
What?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.709
That we totally match.

19:38.845 --> 19:42.215
We're actually
a great couple together.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.654
And yet, you would never
date a girl like me.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.155
That's not true.
Yes, it is.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.757
That's--
No, it's--
Yes.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.860
It's--
It is.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.695
Have you ever dated a girl
that was heavier than you?

19:55.728 --> 19:56.863
Yes, I have.
Have you?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.197
Yes, I have.
No, no, no.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.732
I have.
No, no, no, no.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.033
I didn't say,

20:01.067 --> 20:03.670
"Have you ever fucked
a fat girl, Louie?"

20:03.703 --> 20:06.706
I'm sure you
have, every guy has.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.676
I mean, when I met you,
if I had said,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.244
"Hey, you wanna
go to the back room

20:11.278 --> 20:12.879
and screw on a big
can of peaches?"

20:12.912 --> 20:15.382
You would
have gone for it.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.183
No.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.753
I'm saying, have you
ever dated a fat girl?

20:20.787 --> 20:23.222
Have you ever kissed
a fat girl?

20:23.256 --> 20:25.725
Have you ever
wooed a fat girl?

20:25.758 --> 20:29.896
Have you ever held hands
with a fat girl?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.899
Have you ever
walked down the street

20:32.932 --> 20:35.868
in the light of day

20:35.902 --> 20:38.471
holding hands with
a big girl like me?

20:42.442 --> 20:44.544
Go ahead.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.645
Hold my hand.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.882
What do you
think's gonna happen?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.551
You think your dick's
gonna fall off

20:51.584 --> 20:53.953
if you hold hands
with a fat girl?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.629
You know what
the sad thing is?

21:04.331 --> 21:05.465
That's all I want.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.302
I mean, I can get laid.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.137
Any woman who is willing
can get laid.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.272
I don't want that.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.642
I don't even need
a boyfriend or husband.

21:18.345 --> 21:23.282
All I want is to hold hands
with a nice guy

21:23.316 --> 21:25.318
and walk and talk...

21:34.661 --> 21:35.928
(chuckling)

21:35.962 --> 21:37.296
Huh, huh?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.698
Okay?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.702
Huh?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.337
That's good, right?
You caught on.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.638
Huh?

21:45.672 --> 21:47.774
Takes you a little--
a little while.

21:47.807 --> 21:48.975
(laughing)

21:50.743 --> 21:52.445
You want to
hear a joke?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.780
Sure.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.715
All right, after everything
I say, you say--

21:55.748 --> 21:56.983
you say,
"So did the fat lady."

21:57.016 --> 21:58.451
Okay.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.219
All right,
I went to the zoo.
So did the fat lady.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.788
I saw the monkeys.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.222
So did the fat lady.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.791
I bought some popcorn.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.192
So did the fat lady.

22:06.225 --> 22:07.794
And I got a hot dog
and some candy.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.295
So did the fat lady.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.630
All right,
I saw the giraffe.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.465
So did the fat lady.
And the lions.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.666
So did the fat lady.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.167
I got ice cream
and some doughnuts.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.169
So did the fat lady.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.170
And I got some
lemonade.

22:18.204 --> 22:19.372
So did the fat lady.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.340
Some cotton candy.
So did the fat lady.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.342
I bought a balloon.
So did the fat lady.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.311
The balloon popped.
So...

22:25.344 --> 22:27.847
(laughing)

22:35.688 --> 22:37.289
