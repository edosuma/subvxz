WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:02.370
Previously on Z Nation.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.207
The secret ingredient to bizkits
is lithium.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.242
Whoever controls the bizkits
controls the Talkers.

00:08.276 --> 00:09.443
Whoever controls the Talkers...

00:09.477 --> 00:10.544
Controls Newmerica.

00:10.811 --> 00:11.779
We just found out

00:11.812 --> 00:14.548
that Estes is in charge
of this whole operation.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.550
Calling for the quarantine
of all Talkers.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.553
I've got some questions
for Roman Estes.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.522
That's gonna be a problem
to get to him.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.492
I think I know some guys
that can get past Altura's

00:24.525 --> 00:26.760
high tech security system.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.229
Come on.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.064
Where we headed?

00:30.864 --> 00:31.632
Hacker town.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.614
When you're ready

01:21.615 --> 01:23.417
I can apologize
about losing those weapons.

01:23.451 --> 01:26.354
It's fine. Just my
favorite knife. It's fine.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.523
In the meantime,
watch your step.

01:34.495 --> 01:38.432
Okay. Now some of these wires
could still be hot.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.834
That the tower
we're looking for?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.703
That's what Kaya said.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.611
Anything?

01:50.844 --> 01:52.380
Nope.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.581
Try again.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.155
Three o'clock.

02:03.324 --> 02:03.791
Whoa.

02:05.659 --> 02:06.827
Jeez.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.396
It's me.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.765
You were late, so I fell asleep.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.601
So glad you made it.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.204
I made it, just barely.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.406
Estes has Altura
locked up tight.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.709
Dodging zombies and patrols
all the way here.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.643
How's Kaya?

02:22.843 --> 02:24.245
Mad.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.547
She didn't want me to go.
But she gets it.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.815
We're in a war.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.816
She's right.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.751
Where to next?

02:31.452 --> 02:32.620
Just over there.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.754
What was this place?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.457
Telephone switching center.
Goes back to like 1905.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.659
Was on about its tenth iteration
of technology.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.728
They just kept building
on top of old hardware.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.863
From party lines
to fiber optics.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.365
And now it's Hackerville.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.933
More like Hacker-house.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.669
Not too many hardcore
digital malefactors left.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.637
But they're pros.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.205
If my guess is correct,

02:51.539 --> 02:54.442
they spent many many man hours
trying to crack Altura.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.611
Let the games begin.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.248
That some kind of code?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.417
We supposed to guess
the next number?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.452
Correct.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.419
It's a series of primes.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.187
They want us to prove ourselves
worthy

03:08.155 --> 03:09.357
by entering the next number
in the series.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.365
What is the meaning of 42?

03:17.965 --> 03:20.701
I took Philosophy 101,
but I don't get it.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.936
It's an old hacker joke.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.838
The meaning of 42 is "to be."

03:24.872 --> 03:26.374
It's from
The Hitchhiker's Guide.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.342
It's the total
of the numerical value

03:28.376 --> 03:30.378
of the letters
in those two words.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.246
Trust me, it's funny.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.284
Or not.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.586
I also took Hapkido 101.

03:55.603 --> 04:00.608
*

04:39.079 --> 04:40.748
Hold it right there!

04:41.949 --> 04:42.416
Jesus.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.351
We come in peace.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.952
Uh, hey, Dude.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.555
It's Citizen Z here.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.590
The real one, in the flesh.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.325
We're looking for Ghostking 2.0.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.962
Prove you're Citizen Z, and
answer this question, dude.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.964
So what, you the troll
under the bridge?

04:56.997 --> 04:58.866
Silence!

04:58.899 --> 04:59.733
Got it.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.570
What is the number one rule
in hacking?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.939
Information wants to be free.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.308
That is...

05:08.709 --> 05:11.679
okay by me.
The judges say cool.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.820
You Cruller?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.321
Yeah.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.724
You Ghostking 2.0?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.025
Yes, indeed.

05:25.058 --> 05:25.726
Cool.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.661
I've got something for you.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.862
For me?

05:28.896 --> 05:29.863
What's that?

05:31.565 --> 05:33.534
Kaya in the Skya
says hello, bitch.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.138
You got knocked the f...

05:38.171 --> 05:43.143
[electric guitar theme music
plays]

05:43.176 --> 05:45.546
* Have mercy,

05:47.180 --> 05:53.954
* Oh, have mercy. *

05:58.626 --> 05:59.627
What was that for?

05:59.827 --> 06:00.594
He knows.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.095
That's my wife you're trolling.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.398
Dude, it's not my fault
she's hot.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.032
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.771
How'd you guys even get in here?

06:11.038 --> 06:13.106
We...passed your test.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.543
For the most part.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.911
Can everyone please be quiet?!

06:18.679 --> 06:21.114
I'm trying to meditate.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.185
Look, what do you guys want?

06:25.218 --> 06:26.520
We need your help.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.789
We don't do help.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.625
We need to see the contents
of Estes' computer.

06:32.693 --> 06:33.961
That's impossible.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.931
All right,
it'll take a few hours.

06:37.965 --> 06:38.866
Or more.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.667
I told you he'd do it.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.637
No one said yes yet.
I mean what do we get out of it?

06:43.671 --> 06:44.738
What you want?

06:45.473 --> 06:46.940
What do we want?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.643
Well I'd love to have
a new laptop.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.678
I'd like a new car.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.112
Twelve inch

06:52.613 --> 06:53.547
shotgun.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.883
Just kidding.
Whoa. All right, look.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.118
How about...

06:58.151 --> 07:00.921
In the unlikely event
there is a Newmerica,

07:01.755 --> 07:03.624
we get full immunity

07:03.657 --> 07:07.160
in perpetuity worldwide
for any cybercrimes

07:07.194 --> 07:09.162
we might, or might not, commit.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.700
How bout that? Don't hold it
like that cuz the bullet...

07:12.733 --> 07:13.601
Whoa, okay.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.968
What kind of cybercrime?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.137
Little bit of this,
little bit of that.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.739
You know, nothing too bad.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.042
Do you want my help or not?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.044
That's making me uncomfortable.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.145
All right.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.150
If you help us now,

07:30.951 --> 07:34.588
I will try to get you a pardon
in the future.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.690
Nice.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.563
Oh wait, let's shake on it
like a man.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.765
You don't have to do that.
Don't do that.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.833
Don't do that.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.768
I won't do that. Come on.
Let's go. Fair enough.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.603
Let's get it started.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.944
I don't know how much longer
we can wait

07:56.977 --> 07:58.178
for Finn and the others.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.247
We should've never split up.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.750
If we don't get these Talkers
some bizkits or brains

08:02.783 --> 08:03.617
or something,

08:03.651 --> 08:05.118
they're gonna start turning
Z fast.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.521
Oh really?
Tell me something I don't know.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.892
And then Doc shows up
with these battery lickers?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.661
What the hell's up with that?

08:13.694 --> 08:14.962
How are the miners doing?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.130
Great. Great. Super great.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.667
As long as your definition of
great is starving for brains

08:19.700 --> 08:21.602
and slowly turning zombie.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.905
Dude? I think your fish
are dead.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.239
Man, they ain't fish in there.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.141
Those are bricks
made of pure lithium.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.844
It's what they're
using the Talkers to mine for.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.647
That's why they eat the
batteries. It's the lithium.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.251
Wait. Yeah, I saw this before
on the black market.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.321
Altura militia were feeding it
to Talkers like crack.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.791
They were slicing it like
truffles treating it like nitro.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.293
It's super flammable.
That's why it's in the liquid.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.460
They eat those?

08:47.494 --> 08:51.198
Yeah just a slice on the tongue.
It worked like the brains.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.268
Uh, how's your truffle
slicing skills?

08:58.772 --> 08:59.873
I'll get rid of them.

08:59.907 --> 09:00.941
Yeah.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.784
Shit. It's Estes.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.327
Welcome to Limbo!

09:21.261 --> 09:21.962
Ramon,

09:21.995 --> 09:24.598
what a pleasure to see you
again.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.734
And I see you brought
your backup dancers.

09:26.934 --> 09:27.835
It's Roman.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.736
Open up, Murphy.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.072
Oh, sorry.
But we're closed to the public.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.079
You're sheltering
escaped Talkers.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.015
What are you talking
about?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.884
We know they're here. Open up.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.287
Don't you need a search warrant
or something?

09:47.320 --> 09:47.821
Warrant?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.257
This is the apocalypse.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.660
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.226
Stand back.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.831
I really should clean up
a little bit before you...

10:04.972 --> 10:06.674
Welcome to Limbo.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.909
Or at least what's left of it.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.393
Negative.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.297
Take it one at a time.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.700
One at a time.
It has to be here.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.705
Negative.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.876
One sec.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.016
Lock the door.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.084
It's locked.
I'm the only one here.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.088
This is my friend, Becky.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.791
She came to me for help
when she got sick.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.159
I've been hiding her ever since.

10:59.192 --> 10:59.993
Is she a...

11:00.027 --> 11:00.694
Talker?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.262
Yes.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.934
I'm...so...hungry.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.836
I bet.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.337
Let's see how dead you are.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.443
It looks like toxic shock.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.380
Some infection
overwhelmed her immune system.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.349
I came as soon as I could.
There were so many militia.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.416
It wouldn't have mattered.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.418
Everything is becoming
antibiotic resistant.

11:26.253 --> 11:26.720
There's nothing
you could've done.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.723
None of that now.

11:32.159 --> 11:32.960
She needs bizkits.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.327
I know.
But I don't have anything.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.764
The militia took it all.
Every crumb.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.208
Keep looking.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.845
Mini reunion?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.246
How touching.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.414
What's the occasion?

11:54.447 --> 11:55.849
It's Thursday.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.751
Hey, Doc. It's Thursday, right?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.953
I dunno. Wednesday. Thursday.

11:59.987 --> 12:00.788
Cut.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.123
Thursday.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.557
Doc, from what I understand,

12:04.591 --> 12:08.929
you are quite the maverick
when it comes to strip poker.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.133
Strip poker.
Yeah, I got one word of advice.

12:13.166 --> 12:13.934
Layering.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.102
Mm-hmm.

12:15.936 --> 12:16.904
Join me, Murphy.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.106
Of course.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.741
But there is
a two drink minimum.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.219
There were dozens of Talkers
here.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.187
Says who?

12:34.221 --> 12:35.188
Everyone.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.524
I don't see any Talkers here.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.326
Seeing is one thing.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.363
Believing, another.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.499
I believe they are here.

12:47.567 --> 12:51.471
Well who you gonna believe,
me or your spidey sense?

12:52.205 --> 12:56.109
Maybe I'll just wait it out,
test my theory.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.380
About that two drink minimum.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.382
Water for everyone.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.451
That's two bullets per glass.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.353
Put it on Altura's tab.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.321
Altura doesn't have a tab here.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.481
I'll be right back.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.989
Should I deal you in?

13:42.189 --> 13:42.956
No.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.007
While we're waiting,

14:00.207 --> 14:02.342
have you seen George

14:02.375 --> 14:05.112
and that friend of hers,
Lieutenant Warren?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.179
Nope.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.483
But you were such good friends?

14:11.151 --> 14:14.421
I don't have her chipped now,
do I?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.357
Go fish.

14:24.264 --> 14:28.135
Okay guys, let me
introduce you to the gang.

14:28.435 --> 14:32.172
Right here we have GrrlBoom's
node. It is awesome.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.342
Look, it's a fine setup.
She did it all herself.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.977
And this...

14:38.011 --> 14:39.479
is GrrlBoom.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.083
She learned to code
at the young age of eight.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.152
Genius. Her dad taught her, man.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.519
Who's that?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.955
Oh this, this is

14:47.988 --> 14:50.057
Skip Brickel,

14:50.090 --> 14:52.159
Brickel, Brickel.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.494
Weighing in at 220 pounds.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.563
He is the richest man
in the world.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.534
He specializes in crypto
currency accounts, man.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.537
He's been finding and harvesting
bitcoin mines

15:04.571 --> 15:07.474
that are still in operation
for a long time now.

15:08.008 --> 15:08.942
Bitcoin?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.478
Where you gonna spend that?

15:11.511 --> 15:14.481
Hey man, sometimes hacking
is the journey.

15:17.184 --> 15:18.385
What about him?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.353
Oh, that guy.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.690
That is Bones. He is old school.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.127
He is from the old
freak phone era.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.295
You know

15:28.328 --> 15:30.063
when the Cap'n Crunch whistle
was the keys to the kingdom.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.464
I remember it well.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.534
Like a ninja on a keyboard.
Sweet and sexy.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.169
Why hasn't he turned?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.405
Well, you know
when you got one Talker,

15:38.438 --> 15:42.242
a bag of bizkits goes a long
way. So what can we do you for?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.043
Rumor has it,

15:44.177 --> 15:46.146
you've been trolling Roman Estes
for quite some time now.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.982
Yeah, we've been having
a running battle back and forth

15:49.016 --> 15:51.684
since he tried to shut us down
when we first got here.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.155
Kaya said you bragged about
cracking his password.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.356
Maybe.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.358
Can you hack into
Altura's network?

15:59.392 --> 16:00.760
We can totally get through
the firewall no problem,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.429
like a hot knife through butter.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.763
Getting to the laptop,

16:03.796 --> 16:06.066
that's gonna be tougher.
We've tried.

16:06.099 --> 16:10.370
He has his own air-gapped
email server, the full Hillary.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.739
So we're gonna need
someone on the inside

16:12.772 --> 16:14.474
with access to the laptop.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.277
We got someone on the inside.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.311
Huh, who?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.381
Dude, put the phone anyway, man.
We...

16:21.414 --> 16:23.050
Relax,
we're not on their network.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.451
We just hijack
their infrastructure

16:24.484 --> 16:26.053
for our own unlimited plan.

16:27.454 --> 16:28.288
Excuse me.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.765
Kaya in the Skya
reporting for duty.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.368
Whoa! Who's the babe?

16:43.270 --> 16:45.438
The mother of my child.
Show some respect.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.307
All right, all right.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.477
What's the plan?

16:51.411 --> 16:53.413
We got to jump that air-gap
and gain control

16:53.446 --> 16:55.548
or possession of his laptop.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.218
I can do that.
Just get me inside.

16:58.251 --> 16:58.718
Hey, baby.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.323
If anything happens to her,
I will kill you.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.357
Understood.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.763
I am on their surveillance
system.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.764
That was quick.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.434
Took a month the first time.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.371
Nice thing
about Surveillance States,

17:18.871 --> 17:21.408
you can always see
what everyone's up to.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.042
There she is.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.415
All right, so I'm just gonna
replace their live feed

17:28.448 --> 17:30.717
with a little loop de loop, and

17:31.318 --> 17:32.219
boom.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.354
No more Kaya in the Skya.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.422
Nice.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.259
I'm at the rear
service entrance.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.193
Gotcha.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.597
Looking at a card reader
and keypad.

17:44.831 --> 17:48.101
Ooh, Bones has Altura's
employees file,

17:48.135 --> 17:49.502
which include the card key data.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.439
Hey, Bones! Shoot up those IDs!

17:52.472 --> 17:53.840
You'd never know it
from looking at him,

17:53.873 --> 17:56.543
but he is quite
the Catfisherman. Sexy.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.345
We need somebody
with a high clearance.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.547
Uh, thank you, Captain Obvious.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.850
Oh, here we go.
This one looks perfect.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.718
Speaking of obvious.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.387
Estes's ID. Really?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.156
Very funny. What's the key code?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.657
We don't need that, all right?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.625
They didn't do an update
on the maintenance.

18:12.659 --> 18:16.696
So swipe your card,
hold down pound and asterisk,

18:16.729 --> 18:19.199
and just wait
till something happens.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.238
I'm in.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.173
Booya.

18:26.839 --> 18:27.740
Nice.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.110
Be careful baby.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.224
Screw you, Ghostking 2.0.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.292
Excuse me?

18:45.592 --> 18:46.659
Nothing.

18:46.693 --> 18:50.230
Sorry. Just some former
employees turned vandals.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.931
You have a cell phone?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.466
My apologies, Mr. Murphy.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.769
It seems all your Talker friends
have vanished.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.637
Bravo.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.476
I really do wish
you would reconsider my offer

19:03.510 --> 19:04.877
and come work for Altura.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.547
We could really use
your sales experience.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.249
Time to go.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.650
So soon?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.325
We've got an intruder.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.160
Search every inch of the control
center, but keep it quiet.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.565
Okay, punks. You wanna hack?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.735
Let's hack.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.630
Somebody just killed the power
to our door locks.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.765
Maybe Estes?!

20:00.967 --> 20:02.302
He must be onto you.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.636
Get Kaya out of there now.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.772
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.611
We've got company.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.613
Every corridor
has been breached!

20:16.516 --> 20:19.352
Execute order six hundred
sixty six.

20:19.386 --> 20:19.819
Now!

20:20.453 --> 20:21.688
GrrlBoom now!

20:38.405 --> 20:39.406
Guys?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.341
Hello?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.742
Anybody there?

20:43.009 --> 20:44.344
CZ?

20:44.911 --> 20:45.545
Warren?

20:46.479 --> 20:47.814
Where are you guys?

20:49.416 --> 20:52.485
I could use some
situational intel.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.424
Uh, any chance
you guys are gonna help here?

20:57.457 --> 20:58.658
We got this.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.065
You have drones?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.445
Didn't know about this,
did you?

21:23.750 --> 21:26.686
GrrlBoom, we're gonna go in
from each side, okay?

21:26.719 --> 21:30.723
Hey Skip, what's the probability
of success for this?

21:31.057 --> 21:32.792
Hold on. Gimme a sec.

21:34.026 --> 21:37.997
I'm getting 32.33.
That's repeating of course.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.333
All right, nice.
That's better than usual.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.668
Very nice.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.345
Oh, you're killing me, Bones!

21:54.981 --> 21:57.517
We've made a few
modifications here,

21:57.550 --> 21:58.818
as you can see.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.089
Ooh!

22:03.122 --> 22:03.656
Battle cries!

22:03.690 --> 22:05.825
Snootch to the Nootch!

22:16.736 --> 22:19.506
Ooh, nice. Right?

22:19.539 --> 22:20.640
Man. That's brutal.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.074
Bloody.

22:41.894 --> 22:42.495
Nice!

22:44.797 --> 22:45.732
Damn.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.917
All right, GrrlBoom, I'm gonna
wrap around to the back,

23:04.951 --> 23:06.653
you're gonna come to the front,
and we're gonna

23:06.686 --> 23:10.457
go for the bookends to the
around the neckpiece up front.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.992
Hey Skip, get in on this!

23:28.140 --> 23:28.808
Ooh!

23:44.624 --> 23:46.025
Ooh!

23:46.726 --> 23:49.128
I didn't even expect that.
I mean it just happened.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.130
It was like watching an autopsy.

23:52.765 --> 23:53.833
Okay.

23:53.866 --> 23:54.767
Yeah.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.641
Uh oh.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.044
Yo, is everyone out of ammo?

24:05.077 --> 24:06.979
Time to improvise!

24:28.200 --> 24:29.235
Woo!

24:29.702 --> 24:30.102
Oh yes!

24:30.136 --> 24:31.638
Dang! Just in...

24:31.671 --> 24:32.939
How did I think of that?

24:38.578 --> 24:39.546
No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.818
GrrlBoom, look out!

24:46.953 --> 24:47.754
Dammit!

24:48.888 --> 24:50.557
Snoogins.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.258
It's up to me.

24:56.996 --> 24:57.730
Dang.

24:58.130 --> 24:58.898
What happened?

24:59.566 --> 25:01.768
Crash, but finishing strong.

25:02.168 --> 25:02.969
Boom.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.871
Told you we got this.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.774
That was crazy, man. We've
been doing this the hard way.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.809
Yeah. This is you know,
and this is only...

25:09.842 --> 25:11.177
Okay, wait.
How many zombies were...

25:11.210 --> 25:11.911
Look out!

25:14.113 --> 25:16.683
Time to pull out the big guns!

25:34.734 --> 25:36.135
I don't have a shot!

25:41.140 --> 25:41.908
Dammit, dude!

25:41.941 --> 25:43.676
Sorry, it's not as easy
as it looks!

25:45.912 --> 25:46.579
George!

25:50.950 --> 25:52.151
I wish that thing
would hurry up

25:52.184 --> 25:54.787
and do whatever it is
it's supposed to do.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.234
Everybody get down!

26:10.703 --> 26:11.938
Fire in the Z!

26:20.813 --> 26:21.981
Nice.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.683
I want that.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.719
Do you know what you're doing?

26:26.753 --> 26:27.586
No.

26:29.889 --> 26:30.857
However,

26:32.124 --> 26:34.794
I saw the Altura Militia sell
them for ten bullets a slice.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.063
You just have to be really
careful when cutting it.

26:37.096 --> 26:37.864
It's like nitro.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.366
But it melts
right in your mouth.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.403
Murphy!

26:44.436 --> 26:45.938
Doc says you gotta come.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.740
Apparently somebody's kid
is missing.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.375
Kid?

26:49.876 --> 26:52.712
It's like one thing
after another.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.114
What's up?

26:55.147 --> 26:57.183
Murphy, this is
the kid's parents.

26:57.216 --> 26:57.950
His name's Mason,

26:58.985 --> 27:00.286
and they haven't seen him
since this morning.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.388
All right,
we'll go look for him.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.222
We'll find him.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.056
Mason.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.825
We'll find him. Really.

27:05.858 --> 27:06.659
Mason?

27:06.693 --> 27:08.027
Mason?

27:09.228 --> 27:11.330
Looks like it's gonna hurt
a while.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.765
I'm fine.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.834
She didn't mean it.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.707
What's this?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.742
You're analyzing blood samples?

27:22.942 --> 27:23.676
Yeah.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.913
By hand,
when I really need a computer.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.981
What are you looking for?

27:29.015 --> 27:31.050
An anomaly, a mutation.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.719
Something that gives
deceased humans

27:32.752 --> 27:34.353
the immunity
that lithium gives them.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.122
Any luck?

27:37.256 --> 27:38.390
Not really.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.728
Well actually,

27:42.895 --> 27:45.898
there's one sample that shows
the anomaly I'm looking for.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.901
But it won't do us any good.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.104
Murphy?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.140
That's great.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.977
First, I would have to isolate
the positive gene.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.012
But Murphy's blood
is so full of crap

28:00.046 --> 28:02.849
that I wouldn't know
which gene has what effect.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.250
God.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.451
Becks.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.254
What do you want?

28:08.287 --> 28:09.155
Brains!

28:11.023 --> 28:13.760
There must be something
we can do for her.

28:19.031 --> 28:19.932
Mason?

28:20.132 --> 28:21.267
Mason?

28:24.236 --> 28:25.004
Still looking?

28:25.671 --> 28:26.538
Yeah, still no sign of him.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.107
He's got to be around here
some place.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.442
These Talkers
blend into the furniture.

28:30.476 --> 28:31.143
Mason?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.512
Shhh. You hear that?

28:33.545 --> 28:34.380
I heard a knocking.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.147
Yeah.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.083
It's coming from the back door.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.317
Maybe it's the kid.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.221
Found him!

28:42.254 --> 28:43.389
Found him!

28:44.423 --> 28:47.794
I believe I have something
that belongs to you.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.045
How we doin, Girlfriend?
We in?

29:07.546 --> 29:09.882
I'm right outside Estes's door.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.985
You've got three militia
coming up the stairs.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.524
Card swipe coming your way.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.307
Did you really think
you'd get away with this?

29:35.574 --> 29:37.076
Get away with what?

29:38.110 --> 29:40.112
I'm just trying to help them.

29:40.312 --> 29:43.415
You know, I'm hearing this,
but I'm seeing this.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.552
What, with the roundups
and the lockdowns

29:46.585 --> 29:48.387
and unleashing the vigilantes,

29:48.420 --> 29:50.456
not very supportive
quite frankly.

29:50.857 --> 29:52.124
It's for their own good.

29:52.158 --> 29:55.494
Oh come on, man. Even for the
zombie apocalypse, that's lame.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.009
What do you really want?

30:10.877 --> 30:13.579
All the Talkers
you have hidden away in there.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.950
I don't have any Talkers hidden
in Limbo. But even if I did,

30:17.984 --> 30:19.251
which I don't,

30:20.486 --> 30:23.322
I couldn't just give them to
you. They're not mine to give.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.556
I don't own them.

30:24.590 --> 30:27.293
Then you won't mind
if I just take them.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.150
Look,

30:52.384 --> 30:55.354
I'm just a simple businessman
trying to make an honest bizkit.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.255
Well...

30:56.288 --> 30:57.856
Cut the crap, Murphy.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.103
So is this you
and your band of merry men

31:11.137 --> 31:12.471
trying to be supportive?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.607
I'm done wasting my time.
Disarm them.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.081
Hang on.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.618
Very sorry little boy,
but you see,

31:27.153 --> 31:28.520
nobody's here.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.657
Your parents are gone.
They left you.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.327
Look at you.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.129
You're shaking.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.665
Hey, you know what,

31:40.699 --> 31:43.102
I'd be scared too
if my parents abandoned me.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.071
But we have to go now.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.940
And you're never gonna see them
again.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.428
Is that the thanks I get
for saving your little boy?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.364
You're welcome.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.401
Tell them to send more trucks.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.240
Do something!

32:21.773 --> 32:23.275
There's only one thing
left to do.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.547
We can't. Not yet!

32:30.749 --> 32:31.683
Please!

32:31.717 --> 32:33.052
She's already turning.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.420
What about Murphy's blood?

32:34.453 --> 32:35.988
It cured 10K and Warren!

32:36.022 --> 32:37.656
It also
drove everyone in Zona mad!

32:37.689 --> 32:40.592
Murphy's blood might save her.
What's stopping you?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.194
I can't torture
any more Talkers.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.432
We've got to try.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.135
Inject her. Hurry.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.259
Wow.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.627
That was...

33:16.262 --> 33:17.196
wow.

33:18.397 --> 33:21.233
Red, I'm so sorry.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.436
What are you talking about?

33:25.104 --> 33:26.672
Your eye.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.642
You didn't mean it.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.180
Thank you.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.084
Thank you.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.789
What's happening?

33:44.790 --> 33:46.492
She's burning up.

33:50.296 --> 33:51.763
The infection that killed her,

33:52.164 --> 33:53.399
it's come back.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.836
She's dying all over again.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.354
I'm inside Estes' office.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.758
I have eyes on his laptop.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.836
Password?

34:30.869 --> 34:33.272
Hold tight, all right?
This might take a minute.

34:33.305 --> 34:36.242
As you guys can see, we all
have our favorite algorithms.

34:36.275 --> 34:39.478
We're gonna run them
simultaneously.

34:39.511 --> 34:40.612
Meanwhile, Kaya,

34:41.213 --> 34:43.415
do you have that thumb drive
I gave you?

34:43.449 --> 34:44.450
Right here.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.117
Cool.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.353
Soon as you get to Estes'
computer, deploy it.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.288
You got it, baby.

34:49.555 --> 34:53.425
Uh, that wouldn't be your
NSA toolkit,

34:53.459 --> 34:54.826
that thumb drive, would it?

34:54.860 --> 34:55.561
No.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.695
Uh, bro, come on.

34:57.863 --> 34:58.864
Can you get me a copy of it
since we've done you a solid?

34:58.897 --> 34:59.531
No.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.567
Professional courtesy, bro.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.370
One information liberator
to another.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.437
No.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.839
Dude, there's no more secrets,
right? NSA don't care.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.241
I care.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.810
You know what,
I'll just get it from Kaya.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.712
Do you want to get punched
again?

35:13.745 --> 35:14.413
Hey, nerds.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.883
I got the second letter.
It's E.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.854
All right,
we got another letter.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.791
Way to go, Bones! We got a C!

35:28.394 --> 35:30.462
First letter is an M!

35:30.729 --> 35:31.530
Nice.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.634
Okay guys, these last couple
of letters always take forever,

35:35.667 --> 35:37.303
so hold on.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.438
Mercy.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.407
The password is mercy.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.675
She's right.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.877
Well look who has
a future in hacking.

35:45.911 --> 35:46.912
Good job.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.514
Thanks.

35:49.881 --> 35:50.749
Hey Kaya,

35:51.550 --> 35:53.785
the password is mercy.
M-E-R-C-Y.

35:53.819 --> 35:54.386
Copy.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.188
You know, in leetspeak.

35:57.223 --> 35:58.190
I'm inside.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.225
Yes.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.736
What's gonna happen to them?

36:10.936 --> 36:13.672
Don't worry, we'll take
good care of them. I promise.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.641
They'll be safer
in their own space.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.876
I'm going with them.

36:17.909 --> 36:18.710
Murphy, no.

36:18.744 --> 36:19.811
I got to.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.513
Probably just as well.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.715
Technically speaking,
you are a Talker.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.884
Vigilantes
might get the wrong idea.

36:25.917 --> 36:28.287
You'll be safer
under our protection.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.889
I feel safer already.

36:31.823 --> 36:35.594
You sure you won't reconsider my
offer to come work for Altura?

36:35.627 --> 36:37.429
We have more in common
than you think.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.898
No, we don't.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.434
Well if you change your mind,

36:43.001 --> 36:45.203
we have excellent dental.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.660
Red.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.597
Red, help me.

37:17.836 --> 37:18.737
Hold her down.

37:24.543 --> 37:25.511
What's happening?

37:25.711 --> 37:27.313
She's stuck
in some kind of loop.

37:27.346 --> 37:30.048
The infection kills her, but
Murphy's blood rehumanizes her,

37:30.081 --> 37:31.783
which makes the infection
kill her again,

37:31.817 --> 37:33.319
starting the cycle over.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.589
Make it stop!

37:46.432 --> 37:48.434
Every file on here
looks suspicious.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.836
This is gonna take a while
to upload.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.704
How's my little black drive
working?

37:53.004 --> 37:55.374
Like having Edward Snowden
on a keychain.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.610
Hey, do you have any files
about any lithium mining

37:58.644 --> 37:59.811
or bizkit supplies?

37:59.845 --> 38:01.347
It's all decrypting now.

38:02.548 --> 38:05.317
Lots of reports about that mine
running out of raw lithium,

38:05.351 --> 38:06.452
looking for new sources.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.953
Anything about Dante?

38:08.520 --> 38:11.823
I'm still looking for the video
files CZ shot of the blast.

38:12.090 --> 38:12.958
Hang on.

38:13.559 --> 38:15.727
I think I found it.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.798
Got it.
It's in an editing program.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.901
Looks like he was trying to edit
it to make Dante look guilty.

38:22.934 --> 38:23.769
What?

38:25.103 --> 38:26.772
Why would Estes do that?

38:39.585 --> 38:40.519
Guards coming your way.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.622
Hey Kaya, upload that footage
now and GTFO.

38:44.923 --> 38:45.891
Got it.

38:49.795 --> 38:52.063
Hang on. Watch your step.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.465
There you go.

38:53.765 --> 38:54.633
Step.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.435
Don't overdue it.

38:57.736 --> 38:58.837
Is that everybody?

38:58.870 --> 39:00.572
Just those three.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.574
Sorry, we're human.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.476
Leave them.

39:04.810 --> 39:06.778
Altura has no problem
with humans.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.450
Move em out.

39:12.451 --> 39:15.387
Umm, did I mention
that I am claustrophobic?

39:15.421 --> 39:16.622
No, you didn't.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.289
But don't worry, though.

39:18.323 --> 39:21.026
It's just a short ride to the
nice air conditioned busses

39:21.059 --> 39:23.094
that'll lead you
to your new lives.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.530
New lives?

39:37.843 --> 39:39.711
Her only peace is in death.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.086
What should we do?

39:48.119 --> 39:50.656
I know what I'd want to do
if it was me.

39:56.762 --> 39:57.663
No.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.945
Hey,

40:13.979 --> 40:15.013
hey,

40:15.714 --> 40:17.683
don't be afraid.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.085
Thank you.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.589
You tried.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.462
I love you.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.508
I give you mercy.

40:49.915 --> 40:52.584
Come on, come on.

40:54.152 --> 40:58.524
You would think the leader of
Altura would have faster wifi.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.492
Wait a minute. What is this?

41:00.926 --> 41:01.927
Guys,

41:02.127 --> 41:04.630
anybody know what this is?

41:04.863 --> 41:07.866
Hey baby,
use the restore python script.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.009
Document un-redacting now.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.211
What does that mean?

41:23.214 --> 41:25.584
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Kaya,
you gotta get out of there.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.753
You got some guards
coming to you right now. Go!

41:27.786 --> 41:28.987
Kaya, get out of there!

42:06.191 --> 42:07.759
Final mercy?

42:12.798 --> 42:14.733
What's final mercy?
