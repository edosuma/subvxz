female announcer: PREVIOUSLY
ON UNITED STATES OF TARA...
>> WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.050
>> WE'RE IN DIFFERENT PLACES
IN OUR LIFE.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.218
I JUST WANT TO BE
AN EMPLOYEE AGAIN.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.519
>> I'M NOT SURE
I CAN DO THAT.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.588
>> I GOT FIRED
FROM WORK TODAY.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.490
GENE, CAN I HAVE MY JOB BACK?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.792
>> KATE, I'VE GIVEN YOU THE
AFTER-SCHOOL SHIFT ON MONDAY.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.628
I HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.430

00:29.463 --> 00:31.265
>> YOU'RE SO CUTE.
COME ON.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.766
>> THANK YOU.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.202
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE?

00:34.235 --> 00:35.803
DO YOU THINK DR. PETE
CAN FIX ME?

00:35.836 --> 00:37.438
>> YOU'RE A NICE-LOOKIN' WOMAN.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.607
>> I BET THAT COMMIE DOCTOR'LL
FIX YOU UP GOOD.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.608
I THINK THERE MAY BE
A NEW ALTER.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.176
>> TELL ME EVERYTHING NOW.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.612
>> IT'S ANIMALISTIC.
PURE ID, I GUESS.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.114
DR. OCEAN SAYS
WITH THE APPEARANCE OF--

00:46.147 --> 00:47.348
>> WAIT, YOU AND DR. OCEAN
HAVE BEEN

00:47.381 --> 00:49.183
TALKING ABOUT THIS--
ABOUT ME?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.518
>> I'M GONNA GO MEET TARA'S
OLD ROOMMATE HEIDI.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.820
>> ONE MORNING,
TARA COMES BACK TO THE ROOM,

00:52.853 --> 00:54.155
AND SHE HAD BEEN
KNOCKED AROUND.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.823
HIS NAME WAS TRIP JOHANSSEN.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.525
>> WAIT TILL TARA'S
NEXT SESSION

00:57.558 --> 00:59.193
AND WE'LL TALK TO HER TOGETHER
ABOUT ALL THIS.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.761
[sighs]

01:04.565 --> 01:07.535
[contemplative music]

01:07.568 --> 01:11.205
*

01:11.239 --> 01:14.275
* OPEN UP THE SKY

01:14.308 --> 01:17.511
* THIS MESS IS GETTING HIGH

01:17.545 --> 01:22.483
* IT'S WINDY,
AND OUR FAMILY NEEDS A RIDE *

01:22.516 --> 01:24.352
*

01:24.385 --> 01:29.257
* I KNOW WE'LL BE JUST FINE

01:29.290 --> 01:36.297
* WHEN WE LEARN TO LOVE
THE RIDE *

01:36.330 --> 01:40.668
* I KNOW WE'LL BE FINE

01:40.701 --> 01:45.839
* WHEN WE LEARN TO LOVE
THE RIDE *

01:45.873 --> 01:48.209
*

01:48.242 --> 01:52.680
* I KNOW WE'LL BE
JUST FINE *

01:52.713 --> 01:54.848
* WHEN WE LEARN TO LOVE

01:54.882 --> 01:56.817
* THE RIDE

01:59.587 --> 02:05.259
>> SO...LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE NEW ALTER.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.760
>> [sighs]

02:06.794 --> 02:08.529
CAN I JUST SAY
I THINK IT'S TOTALLY WEIRD

02:08.562 --> 02:10.264
THAT YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT ME
WHEN I WASN'T THERE.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.433
I MEAN, I KNOW SOMETIMES
MAX AND I COME TOGETHER,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.368
BUT AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE MY THERAPIST?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.237
>> OF COURSE I AM.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.338
>> THAT'S MY FAULT.
I CAME OVER HERE.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.173
DR. OCEAN DIDN'T--

02:19.207 --> 02:21.409
>> THERE WAS NEVER ANY BREACH
OF CONFIDENTIALITY.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.776
>> WAS IT A CRISIS?

02:22.810 --> 02:25.279
I MEAN, WAS I A THREAT
TO MYSELF OR OTHERS?

02:25.313 --> 02:27.215
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.317
I JUST WANTED TO GET YOU
SOME SUPPORT.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.784
>> WELL, I DON'T FEEL
SUPPORTED.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.553
I FEEL KIND OF SOLD OUT.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.588
>> WELL, GREAT.

02:34.622 --> 02:37.625
>> WHAT CAN I DO...
RIGHT NOW?

02:37.658 --> 02:41.529
>> ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP ME
UNDERSTAND GIMME?

02:41.562 --> 02:47.968
>> I BELIEVE THAT GIMME HOLDS
ALL YOUR RAW EMOTIONS.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.471
IT'S GIMME'S JOB
TO KEEP THE TRUTH

02:50.504 --> 02:51.705
FROM COMING TO LIGHT.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.243
>> [sighs]

02:55.276 --> 02:57.478
I KNOW THE NAME
OF THE GUY.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.482
>> YOU WHAT?

03:01.515 --> 03:06.420
>> I KNOW THE NAME OF THE GUY
AT BOARDING SCHOOL.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.657
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.692
>> I WISH YOU WOULD STAY.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.828
IT'S UP TO YOU.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.665
IT'S HER SESSION.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.600
>> I MET WITH
YOUR OLD ROOMMATE HEIDI.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.569
>> WHAT?!
>> I MET WITH HEIDI.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.003
THEY GUY'S A FREAKIN'
JOHANSSEN.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.339
>> I DON'T WANNA KNOW!
>> SO OF COURSE...

03:25.373 --> 03:26.474
THERE'S NO RECORD OF ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU

03:26.507 --> 03:27.941
AT THAT SCHOOL.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.010
HIS FAMILY'S NAME'S
ON EVERY BUILDING.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.779
>> IT'S A BIG FREAKING
BLACK HOLE, MAX.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.780
THE MONTH BEFORE
AND THE MONTH AFTER.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.548
THERE IS NOTHING THERE.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.250
AND EVERY SHRINK WHO'S EVER
LOOKED INSIDE MY SKULL

03:36.284 --> 03:38.686
HAS SAID THERE IS A REASON
I DON'T KNOW.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.321
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THAT REASON IS.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.956
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.858
>> [scoffs]

03:44.892 --> 03:46.960
IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT
ALL THESE JOHN WAYNE MOVIES

03:46.994 --> 03:48.496
GOING ON INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.997
LIKE YOU'RE SOME COWBOY,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.599
AND YOU'RE GONNA RIDE INTO TOWN
ON YOUR BIG HORSE

03:51.632 --> 03:55.035
AND CLEAN EVERYTHING UP.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.740
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M NOT YOUR TOWN.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.778
[door shuts]

04:04.812 --> 04:07.381
>> SO YOU'RE GOING ON SHIFT?

04:07.415 --> 04:08.982
>> HOW'D YOU GUESS?

04:09.016 --> 04:12.386
>> HOW PSYCHED ARE YOU
YOU'RE OFF FROM SCHOOL TODAY?

04:12.420 --> 04:15.523
AH, TEACHER WORK DAYS
ARE SECOND ONLY TO BOMB SCARES.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.626
[laughs]

04:18.659 --> 04:20.961
THAT WASN'T FUNNY.

04:20.994 --> 04:26.667
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.937
[clears throat]

04:29.970 --> 04:31.972
TOMORROW NIGHT
I HAVE TWO TICKETS

04:32.005 --> 04:33.574
TO MY ROOMMATE KURT'S
IMPROV SHOW.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.409
IT'S GREAT.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.911
I MEAN, THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA SAY NEXT.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.814
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK
I'M COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.082
SORRY.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.917
>> OH, REALLY?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.387
LAST TIME YOU WERE SICK
YOU HAD A PARTY.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.360
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
COMING DOWN WITH, DO YOU THINK?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.595
>> HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.064
I THINK IT'S PLAGUE FROM
THE CHICKEN SALAD WE SERVE HERE.

04:57.097 --> 05:00.501
BUT I MEAN, IT COULD ALSO BE
STAPH INFECTION.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.002
YOU KNOW,
FROM GRAMBO'S COKE NAIL.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.406
>> WOW, KITTY.
WAY TO HIT ME WHERE I LIVE.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.674
>> [sighs]

05:06.707 --> 05:08.942
>> YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.045
>> REALLY?
>> YEAH.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.714
>> ARE YOU GONNA DOCK ME?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.583
>> OF--OF COURSE NOT.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.686
>> YOU WERE THINKING
ABOUT IT.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.724
>> I GOTTA TAKE KIMMY
TO SOME GYMNASTICS BULLSNOT

05:23.757 --> 05:25.459
PIZZA BULLSNOT.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.994
I'LL BE BACK AFTER
TO FINISH THE PROJECT, THOUGH.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.464
>> YEAH, THE PROJECT FROM HELL
THAT REFUSES TO END.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.099
>> IT'S COOL, MISTER.
I AIN'T MAD AT YA.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.967
>> CHARMAINE, YOU KEEP SAYING
"SPANGLY TOP,"

05:34.001 --> 05:35.936
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE T DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING SPANGLY.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.805
SHE'S NOT CELINE DION.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.073
OKAY, I'LL TAKE A LOOK
AND I'LL LEAVE IT OUT FOR YOU.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.575
BYE.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.711
>> HI, MRS. GREGSON.
>> OH, HEY, JASON.

05:43.744 --> 05:47.548
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.782
HE'S CUTE.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.117
>> WHAT?

05:50.150 --> 05:53.987
>> YOU SURE HE'S

05:54.021 --> 05:56.657
>> WOW, MOM, THAT IS
SO WILDLY HELPFUL.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.859
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.830
>> [sighs]

06:09.937 --> 06:12.139
>> YOU'RE LOOKING UP FLIGHTS
TO TOKYO?

06:12.172 --> 06:13.907
>> YEAH.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.743
NOT THAT I'LL EVER BE ABLE
TO AFFORD IT

06:15.776 --> 06:17.144
ON MY SWEATSHOP SALARY.

06:17.177 --> 06:21.181
HOW 'BOUT THIS:
"BUS RIDE TO OMAHA, $45.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.651

06:23.684 --> 06:25.986
>> WOW, YOU MUST BE DESPERATE.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.521
>> YEAH.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.457
I JUST KINDA MADE
A BAD DECISION AT WORK,

06:29.490 --> 06:33.093
SO NOW I WANT TO CRAWL OUT
OF MY FREAKING SKIN.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.795
>> KINDA JUST WISH I COULD
GET AWAY LIKE YOU DO.

06:34.828 --> 06:40.067
>> EH, IT'S NOT AS GLAMOROUS
AS I MAKE IT LOOK.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.101

07:11.565 --> 07:12.733
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
ON A ROAD TRIP.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.202
>> DOES DAD KNOW?

07:15.235 --> 07:18.772
>> MM, HE DOES NOW.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.509
>> HEY,

07:21.542 --> 07:22.710
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD,
BUT KATE AND I

07:22.743 --> 07:23.777
REALLY NEED TO GET
OUT OF TOWN.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.613
>> BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER?

I WON'T TRY TO STOP YOU.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.155
NOT THAT I COULD.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.198
HEY, CHECK YOU OUT.

07:45.232 --> 07:49.002

08:23.837 --> 08:25.673
YOU DRIVE LIKE
A LITTLE OLD LADY.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.974
>> MOM, WELL...

08:27.007 --> 08:28.776
YOU NEVER TOOK ME OUT
TO TEACH ME.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.744
I HAD TO DO

08:40.320 --> 08:42.623
HE WAS TEACHING ME HOW

08:42.656 --> 08:48.596
AND HE BACKED INTO
MR. HUBBARD'S MAILBOX.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.899
HEY, DAD WAS COOL
WITH US LEAVING, RIGHT?

08:54.034 --> 08:58.005
>> HE GETS SO WORRIED
ABOUT ME.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.608
I'VE BEEN--

09:00.641 --> 09:03.777
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT
LATELY.

09:10.350 --> 09:14.054
>> MOM, LET'S NOT STRESS.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.288
YOU WANT TO JUST
CHECK IN HERE?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.758
WE CAN PLAY PONG

09:41.114 --> 09:42.783

A VERY LIGHT SWEATER.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.785
I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.054
BUT I JUST GOT BACK
FROM A VERY VIGOROUS RUN.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.989
>> DON'T MAKE IT A HABIT,
MARSHALL.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.024
YOU'RE A CUTE KID.
OKAY?

09:51.058 --> 09:53.160
SKINNY SUITS YOU.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.395

A BREATHTAKING VIEW.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.197
TATTOO PARLOR
AND A CHIPOTLE.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.732
>> THAT'S PERFECT.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.901
MAYBE I CAN GET A TATTOO
IN HONOR OF GIRLS NIGHT.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.936
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
YOU'RE 15.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.173
>> YEAH, BUT I COULD PASS
FOR 18.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.075
I'M AN OLD SOUL.
>> OH, YEAH?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.844
WHAT GUY TOLD YOU THAT?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.114
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.382
>> I'M GOING SWIMMING.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.117
>> I DIDN'T BRING
MY BATHING SUIT.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.988
>> WELL, I GUESS YOU CAN
WATCH NOVA OR SOMETHING.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.394
>> YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR ATTRIBUTES.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.763
FORCE YOURSELF
TO TAKE THE COMPLIMENT.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.099
>> WELL, CAN I FORCE PEOPLE
TO GIVE THEM TO ME?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.767
