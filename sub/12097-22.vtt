Oh, no. No. By the end
of your drilling period,

12:16.802 --> 12:18.303

be finely disciplined

12:18.304 --> 12:21.806
to accept and to send forward
the edicts of the church.

a better word?

Do you think I actually
wash people's brains?

Well, I mean, it sounded
like you were saying...

12:33.319 --> 12:34.819
Cleansing, maybe.

12:34.820 --> 12:35.820
The cleansing of the mind

12:35.821 --> 12:37.822
leads to a purification
of the body.

12:37.823 --> 12:38.823

Now...

19:57.262 --> 19:58.763
I want you to know

19:58.764 --> 20:02.767
that I really never meant
to hurt either of you.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.770
I... I love you both.

20:05.771 --> 20:09.774
But it seems that in order
to be with the man I love,

20:09.775 --> 20:14.779
I have to hurt
the other man I love.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.783
And so I just don't know
what else to do.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.785
Does this mean
you've made a decision?

20:20.786 --> 20:23.287
Yes.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.789
I have.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.805
I don't know...
maybe I never saw a spaceship.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.808
I mean, I've been here, what?
Eight hours now.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.310
Nothing.

20:47.312 --> 20:51.315
Except... I mean, why come again
to the same spot?

20:51.316 --> 20:52.316
I mean, why land here again?

20:52.317 --> 20:53.818
An empty field in Connecticut?

20:53.819 --> 20:55.820
They could land in... Paris.

[SIGHS]

21:03.328 --> 21:04.829
I probably never saw it.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.832
It was probably
just my imagination.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.834
Just...

21:09.835 --> 21:10.835
Oh, God.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.837
Oh, what if I'm getting crazy
again?

21:12.838 --> 21:14.839
I'm talking to myself here.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.341
That's a sign.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.846
I'm not... I'm not.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.848
Well, I thought...

21:23.849 --> 21:24.849
Come on. I'm not crazy.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.351
I mean, if I was crazy,
I wouldn't think I was crazy,

21:27.352 --> 21:29.854
so I'm not crazy.

21:33.358 --> 21:34.859
I might not be crazy,

21:34.860 --> 21:37.862
but waiting around here
for a spaceship

21:37.863 --> 21:40.865
is definitely not sane.

21:40.866 --> 21:44.869
Oh, God, what's the matter
with me?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.370
What's the matter with me?

21:46.371 --> 21:48.372
What's the matter
with this whole family?

21:48.373 --> 21:49.373
I mean, all right, I mean,

21:49.374 --> 21:51.375
I'm here waiting
for visitors from Mars.

21:51.376 --> 21:52.877
They're all home performing
an exorcism on my nephew

21:52.878 --> 21:54.879
because he's possessed.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.381
It's a... it's a nice group.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.884
My brother-in-law,
hey, he murders my son,

21:59.885 --> 22:02.887
loses his memory, disappears,
is reported dead,

22:02.888 --> 22:05.389
he comes to life.

Danny's wife gets kidnapped

22:12.397 --> 22:13.898
and now he's out
looking for the killers.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.399
And Jodie, poor Jodie,
gets jilted,

22:15.400 --> 22:18.903
ends up, he moves in
with a girl... she's gay.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.905
And Mary...

22:20.906 --> 22:23.407
I almost lose Mary for good.

22:23.408 --> 22:24.408
If I lose my mind,

22:24.409 --> 22:27.411
I'm definitely
going to lose her.
