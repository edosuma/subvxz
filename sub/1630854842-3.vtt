WEBVTT

00:13.666 --> 00:15.250
So what are we looking at?

00:15.958 --> 00:19.333
I put the ring behind
silver glass so we can safely examine it.

00:19.416 --> 00:20.750
Yeah, but it's daylight.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.666
Yes, well, to state the obvious,

00:22.750 --> 00:24.916
I'm a bit more risk averse than you,
aren't I?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.500
Now, the intruder was after the ring.
But why?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.500
Hallmarks.

00:35.791 --> 00:39.958
H 22 115.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.791
Maybe "H" for Hugo?

00:42.875 --> 00:46.458
That's what I thought. But who was
the other big "H" in Annabel's life?

00:47.166 --> 00:48.583
Act II, Scene 2.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.541
"Doubt thou the stars are fire,

00:55.208 --> 00:56.875
doubt that the sun doth move,

00:56.958 --> 00:59.083
doubt truth to be a liar,

00:59.166 --> 01:01.000
but never doubt I love."

01:02.625 --> 01:03.833
This is it!

01:04.416 --> 01:05.875
The hallmark's a love letter.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.750
That's why Annabel wanted
me to take the ring.

01:07.833 --> 01:11.750
It proves she and Hugo were together.
That has to be enough to put him away.

01:11.833 --> 01:14.666
-Right?
-No. It doesn't prove anything.

01:15.458 --> 01:19.041
So they were together.
But that isn't evidence he murdered her.

01:19.125 --> 01:21.458
-Hmm.
-The ring's going in the safe.

01:21.541 --> 01:25.916
I'm keeping hold of the key,
because, well, you can't be trusted.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.791
-But it's her source.
-Which you stole illegally.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.666
Now, the final ruling of Sheen Road
just came in.

01:31.750 --> 01:34.541
If we don't get our shit together now,
this agency's done.

01:35.125 --> 01:38.375
-"Mandatory indefinite oversight"?
-What does that mean?

01:38.458 --> 01:40.208
It means we still owe 60 grand,

01:40.291 --> 01:43.041
but now we can't do anything
without adult supervision.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.458
No, no, no. This… this must be a joke.

01:45.541 --> 01:47.583
No. It's a chokehold.

01:47.666 --> 01:48.958
But I've got a plan.

01:49.041 --> 01:50.958
We're going to see a man about a ghost.

02:59.375 --> 03:02.375
So your big, radical plan is a job
at Fairfax Iron,

03:02.458 --> 03:04.333
for work we can't legally do?

03:04.416 --> 03:08.583
George, this negativity, it's why
I don't tell you things in advance.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.333
"Agents required
for unusual supernatural investigation."

03:13.416 --> 03:15.250
"Money commensurate with danger."

03:15.750 --> 03:17.583
I'm guessing that means a lot of danger.

03:17.666 --> 03:19.416
Better be at least 60 grand's worth.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.125
<i>Doors closing.</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:30.625
When we get up there,
we need to be at our absolute best.

03:30.708 --> 03:33.375
Totally professional.
So I'll do the talking.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.083
I saw Sir John Fairfax once.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.625
He donated my school's iron defenses
and gave a speech in assembly.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.500
Miss Kingston got her hair done special.

03:41.583 --> 03:44.625
Yes, that is exactly the sort of thing
I don't want you saying.

03:46.500 --> 03:50.375
When you said "see a man about a ghost,"
do you have a name for who we're meeting?

03:50.875 --> 03:52.625
No. Just the floor.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.041
Twenty.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.000
Top floor. You don't think it's…

04:05.125 --> 04:06.041
<i> Doors closing.</i>

04:06.125 --> 04:09.333
Straight into the office.
That's a classy move.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.666
This is Sir John Fairfax's office.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.041
This doesn't make sense.
John Fairfax doesn't need us.

04:16.125 --> 04:19.041
He's famous. He's rich.
He built Fairfax Iron.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.875
He built this whole building.

04:20.958 --> 04:24.333
Don't you think it's grim someone's
made this much money off the Problem?

04:24.416 --> 04:27.625
I deserve something for keeping
the country safe at night, don't I?

04:27.708 --> 04:29.416
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.541
No, you're right. It is grim.

04:32.041 --> 04:34.333
The Problem has disfigured
the whole world.

04:35.166 --> 04:38.291
A pleasure to meet you, sir.
Anthony Lockwood.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.208
Uh, George Karim and Lucy Carlyle.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.375
We are Lockwood & Co.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.708
Ah, of course. The infamous.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.125
Well, take a seat.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.750
Under the sprinklers.

04:53.166 --> 04:57.791
We didn't expect to deal with
you personally when we answered your ad.

04:58.625 --> 05:02.125
It's a delicate situation.
Best handled discreetly.

05:02.916 --> 05:06.083
I've decided to let go
of a few properties,

05:06.166 --> 05:09.541
-including Combe Carey Hall in Berkshire.

05:09.625 --> 05:15.291
Nice enough place, but it has
a rather stubborn collection of visitors.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.500
Something I've worked very hard
to keep out of the papers

05:18.583 --> 05:21.000
and about which
my prospective buyer knows nothing.

05:21.083 --> 05:24.166
So you need it made safe
before the buyer visits.

05:24.250 --> 05:30.291
Exactly. And I cannot risk damage,
so there can be no flares or explosives.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.291
It's a dangerous job,
to be done quickly and under the radar.

05:33.375 --> 05:36.416
I'm getting quotes
from every significant outfit in London.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.750
So, to be frank,

05:37.833 --> 05:42.958
the only way an agency of your stature
could get it is by underbidding.

05:43.041 --> 05:46.333
Our service is just as good
as our larger competitors,

05:46.416 --> 05:49.333
and we don't need
to chase down cut-rate jobs.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.000
You lie like a politician.

05:52.083 --> 05:55.791
But I started out in casinos,
Mr. Lockwood.

05:56.666 --> 05:58.541
I can always spot a bluff.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.833
Do you think you'll get discretion
from Fittes and Rotwell?

06:01.916 --> 06:04.666
Every decision they make
gets debated by committee.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.041
And you need something more nimble.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.916
Like us. A small independent.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.416
We are the only agency who can do this job
the way you need it doing.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.958
Nice pitch.

06:18.041 --> 06:19.875
But I work very closely with DEPRAC,

06:19.958 --> 06:22.250
and I don't think
this is a job they'll let you do.

06:22.333 --> 06:26.291
That's… why it's probably best
they don't hear about it.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.875
Rotwell just quoted me 90 grand.

06:30.666 --> 06:33.333
I won't pay you a penny more
than the fine you owe DEPRAC.

06:33.416 --> 06:35.458
What is it? 40? 50?

06:35.541 --> 06:38.750
60, actually.
You're obviously a busy man, Sir John,

06:39.458 --> 06:40.875
so let's keep it simple.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.416
You pay our fine,
and we'll fix your house.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.250
So… do we have a deal?

06:50.791 --> 06:52.916
60 grand! He's paying us 60 grand!

06:53.000 --> 06:55.625
But we haven't got it yet.
And we've gotta move fast.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.625
Lucy, get us packed and prepped.

06:57.708 --> 07:01.208
George, find out everything you can
about Combe Carey Hall, all right?

07:01.291 --> 07:04.833
I'm gonna go to Satchell's, find out
what help we can get that doesn't explode.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.750
See you at home, and tell no one.

07:13.416 --> 07:16.541
-This job is gonna kill us.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.625
Wow. This all on Combe Carey Hall?

07:21.708 --> 07:25.333
Yeah, everything Fairfax forgot
to mention. It's not just a country house.

07:25.416 --> 07:29.500
It used to be a satanic priory
of medieval devil worshipers.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.208
Oh, good. Evil monks.

07:31.291 --> 07:34.416
At least we know what we'll be facing.
Anyone fancy another beer?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.416
No, actually, we have no idea.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.875
It's killed loads,
including some at a party 30 years ago,

07:39.958 --> 07:42.000
but those deaths
weren't blamed on the monks.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.125
No, they were blamed
on a Screaming Staircase

07:44.208 --> 07:46.333
or a Red Room, whatever they are.

07:46.416 --> 07:50.625
Without flares, this job is suicide. Look!
We're not the first ones to try, either.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.791
At the start of the Problem,
an elite Fittes team was sent in.

07:53.875 --> 07:58.666
There was only one survivor. And one,
Samaran Pandey, is still unaccounted for.

07:58.750 --> 08:02.041
-Fairfax kept all this from us.
-No, he got himself a good deal.

08:02.125 --> 08:05.791
And so did we. This is a job
that's finally big enough for our talents.

08:07.708 --> 08:08.708
But we're a team,

08:08.791 --> 08:13.500
so… if either of you have another option
on how to keep this agency afloat,

08:13.583 --> 08:14.708
then I'm all ears.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.458
Right. That's decided, then.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.958
-Hello, Lockwood & Co.

08:38.958 --> 08:41.000
-It's Barnes. For you.
-Oh.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.583
-What's with the gloves?
-Stress cleaning.

08:47.250 --> 08:50.125
-Hello?
-<i>Carlyle? Inspector Barnes.</i>

08:50.208 --> 08:52.708
-Uh, hi.
-<i>You told Lockwood you're leaving yet?</i>

08:53.208 --> 08:57.625
Yeah. Yeah, I have, actually.
I'm, um… I'm going in a couple of days.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.208
<i>You might wanna go sooner.</i>

08:59.708 --> 09:02.916
<i>I thought you should know.</i>
<i>Hugo Blake was released this morning.</i>

09:03.666 --> 09:07.875
<i>We don't have enough to hold him. There's</i>
<i>nothing that puts him inside the house.</i>

09:08.458 --> 09:11.916
<i>Maybe if you hadn't burnt it down,</i>
<i>we'd have some physical evidence.</i>

09:12.000 --> 09:14.875
<i>Tell Lockwood I'll brief him</i>
<i>on his new supervisor tomorrow.</i>

09:14.958 --> 09:17.166
-We won't be in tomorrow.
<i>-Why not?</i>

09:18.250 --> 09:21.958
Um… uh… 'Cause the, um…
house is getting fumigated.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.250
<i>The day after, then.</i>

09:25.250 --> 09:26.291
<i>Get home safe.</i>

09:43.708 --> 09:45.750
I hope
you're not making a mess down there!

09:47.041 --> 09:51.500
George, please stop cleaning
and come and help me sort the chains out!

10:23.750 --> 10:24.666
<i>Let go of me.</i>

10:24.750 --> 10:26.583
<i>I can't help you.</i>

10:27.666 --> 10:28.666
<i>You gave me the ring.</i>

10:30.083 --> 10:31.875
<i>Because you can't be trusted.</i>

10:42.833 --> 10:45.166
Wow. There's a lot of green!

10:45.666 --> 10:47.916
Never been
outside of London before, George?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.583
I visit my gran in Sidcup.

10:49.666 --> 10:51.333
Sidcup is in London.

10:51.416 --> 10:54.708
Then you have your answer.
Doesn't look like I've missed much.

10:54.791 --> 10:57.291
I can't believe
we're going to Sir John Fairfax's house.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.458
You've got a real hard-on for him,
haven't you?

10:59.541 --> 11:01.125
If you wanna put it like that.

11:01.625 --> 11:05.875
He's succeeded in everything he's tried.
Publishing, show business.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.791
He didn't even start smelting until
he was in his thirties. Now look at him.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.000
-Hmm.
-And he came from nothing too.

11:12.083 --> 11:15.458
Nah, he's old money. And you have
a massive house in central London.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.791
Well, mortgaged to the hilt, George.
I'm practically a serf.

11:21.750 --> 11:25.791
Welcome. I'm Ellie,
Mr. Fairfax's assistant. This way, please.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.083
-Is Sir John--
-He's waiting at the hall.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.125
-Ow.
-You okay?

11:35.791 --> 11:36.833
Old war wound.

11:37.416 --> 11:40.375
-You were an agent?
-Lots of Mr. Fairfax's employees were.

11:41.041 --> 11:43.416
He's a good man to know
when your talents fade.

11:44.208 --> 11:47.625
Wouldn't say he's kind, but he understands
when people need a second chance.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.625
And he pays well. Hop in.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.583
Must we ride in this old wreck?

12:27.833 --> 12:30.916
What are you doing? Never hesitate
on the threshold of a haunted house.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.375
That's rule number one.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.000
Yeah, I don't know, I just…

12:35.000 --> 12:36.625
thought I could hear something.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.791
Welcome to Combe Carey Hall. You're late.

12:42.875 --> 12:46.458
Now drop your bags and hurry up, please.
The sun's going down.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.958
I can't figure this place out.
Nothing's where it should be.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.958
This is the gallery.

12:57.041 --> 13:01.875
The original priory was destroyed after
the monks decided to commit mass suicide.

13:02.666 --> 13:04.458
You had to make your own fun
in those days.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.916
The modern house was built on the ruins.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.875
-So it's a bit of a Frankenstein.
-Mr. Lockwood broke the deal.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.541
He brought a bomb flare.

13:13.291 --> 13:14.208
Oh dear.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.250
-I asked Ellie to go through your bags.
-You did what?

13:17.333 --> 13:21.666
Well, then you've broken the rules
of the deal too, by searching our bags.

13:21.750 --> 13:25.375
As far as I recall,
there's nothing in our agreement

13:25.458 --> 13:28.666
that prevents me making sure
you won't burn my house down.

13:28.750 --> 13:32.375
You do have form, after all,
so let's call it quits.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.250
Well, time is ticking.

13:35.250 --> 13:36.750
The sun's nearly down.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.500
What the hell did you bring that for?

13:40.083 --> 13:42.541
Apart from anything else,
we've got way better flares.

13:42.625 --> 13:47.041
We'll leave you to work. It's a little
late for us to be in this house safely.

13:47.625 --> 13:50.333
Through there,
you'll find the Screaming Staircase.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.958
It'll take you round to the Red Room,

13:53.041 --> 13:56.000
which is the most likely site
of the primary source.

13:56.708 --> 13:58.083
We'll be back in the morning.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.541
I trust you have everything you need
from here?

14:00.625 --> 14:01.916
I'm sure we'll be fine.

14:02.666 --> 14:03.500
Good luck.

14:10.375 --> 14:13.875
Mr. Lockwood.
DEPRAC. Open the door.

14:15.916 --> 14:16.833
Fumigation!

14:19.125 --> 14:20.916
-Kick it in, would you?
-Yes, ma'am.

14:51.708 --> 14:55.625
-This whole place is freezing up.

14:55.708 --> 14:59.458
And it's hard to map a source because
the rooms don't fit together properly.

14:59.958 --> 15:02.833
I think there's something old
that's hidden away.

15:02.916 --> 15:05.583
-It feels like we're going in blind.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.875
-Are we sure we wanna do this?

15:07.958 --> 15:10.250
I'm not. Lockwood?

15:10.333 --> 15:13.083
-Lockwood, what are you doing?

15:16.833 --> 15:18.541
Just a spot of fishing.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.375
Hopefully, this will relax you both a bit.

15:21.458 --> 15:24.083
I came here yesterday after Satchell's
to do a bit of recon

15:24.166 --> 15:25.708
and stashed this outside.

15:26.208 --> 15:30.083
It was obvious, Fairfax being who he is,
he was gonna search our bags.

15:30.166 --> 15:33.458
And me being me,
I was gonna smuggle flares in.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.750
We don't have our usual kit,
but we do have this bomb flare.

15:37.250 --> 15:40.458
Industrial strength.
Better be. Cost enough.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.583
So the flare in your bag
was just decoy contraband.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.333
All part of the dance.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.500
Why didn't you tell us?

15:48.583 --> 15:51.125
What, and deny us all
this beautiful moment?

15:51.208 --> 15:53.833
Come on, Luce. I'm not a monster.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.000
Right. Shall we?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.166
Sense anything?

16:04.250 --> 16:08.791
If this is a screaming staircase,
it's being very quiet.

16:10.125 --> 16:13.833
-Maybe it's taken the night off.
-Like we should have done.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.083
Everyone ready?

16:58.041 --> 17:00.041
There's bad energy in these walls.

17:01.458 --> 17:02.916
A lot of bad energy.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.750
-There's screaming.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.666
Chaos. There's too many voices.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.375
It's not very red though, is it?

17:21.875 --> 17:24.375
Luce, help me with the chain.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.958
George, secure our retreat.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.041
-Six degrees and falling.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.708
Whatever's here,
it's getting closer.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.583
There's no sign
of any sources yet though. Strange.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.666
George, didn't you say
you suspect there's hidden rooms?

17:47.750 --> 17:50.833
-From the plans, it's highly likely.
-We'll look for evidence.

17:50.916 --> 17:52.916
-You stay here, watch our backs.

17:55.791 --> 18:00.125
Look for cavities, false walls.
Anything that could be concealing sources.

18:01.916 --> 18:04.791
Judging by the number of death glows,
a lot of people died here.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.750
So do we think it's in here?
The source of the primary haunting?

18:11.958 --> 18:14.458
-Temperature, five degrees.
-Wait.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.416
-Uh-- Shh! Stop tapping. I need to listen.

18:25.541 --> 18:27.500
-I'm not tapping.

18:27.583 --> 18:30.208
Get back to the circle now!
Something strange is happening.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.791
-What's making that sound?

18:37.666 --> 18:38.500
Blood.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.375
It's not blood.
It can't be. It's plasm.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.250
Yet it looks like blood,
it smells like blood--

18:47.333 --> 18:49.375
It'll ghost touch you,
so don't let it near.

18:51.791 --> 18:53.791
Oh! How'd it do that?

18:54.500 --> 18:57.750
We've made the circle too big.
There's a weak spot in the middle.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.125
Let's get out of here. Leave the kit.
Head for the door.

19:03.791 --> 19:05.500
I thought you said you secured it?

19:05.583 --> 19:09.000
-I did! This isn't possible!
-It's locked. We're trapped!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.625
-We need to calm down.

19:10.708 --> 19:11.958
It'll feed off our panic.

19:12.041 --> 19:14.541
-Luce, we need another exit.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.958
Go to that place you found,
see if there's something.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.333
George, we need to draw it out
and distract it.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.500
It's time we stopped
being so respectful of this thing.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.291
Come on. Don't be shy.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.541
-Definitely got something here.
-Good. Keep looking.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.000
-It's everywhere.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.375
This is not just one ghost!

19:39.291 --> 19:42.416
-Lucy, what have you found?
-I'm not sure. I need time!

19:42.500 --> 19:45.500
They're working together. Oh shit.

19:45.583 --> 19:46.625
Stay focused.

19:48.541 --> 19:50.916
How are we supposed
to fight that?

19:51.708 --> 19:53.500
Lucy, please tell me that's a door.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.375
I'd like to start running now!

20:07.333 --> 20:10.458
-A poltergeist could shut a door.

20:10.541 --> 20:12.833
Only Changers can manifest
as something as weird as blood.

20:12.916 --> 20:16.416
But never on that scale!
Are we talking a new kind of Type Two?

20:16.500 --> 20:20.750
That was just a regular Changer.
No ghost can move that much heavy iron.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.000
-Someone living did that.
-What? Who?

20:24.041 --> 20:27.666
Fairfax? No, he wouldn't dare
be back there to do that.

20:27.750 --> 20:31.291
Maybe Ellie still has some talent.
Maybe we're being tested.

20:31.375 --> 20:35.000
What? You can't possibly imagine we're
still gonna get something out of this.

20:35.083 --> 20:36.666
-It's a deathtrap.

20:36.750 --> 20:37.791
Oh God.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.625
Temperature just got lower.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.208
Which means the Red Room
isn't even the original haunting.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.250
-It's just a secondary.

20:45.791 --> 20:47.541
There's something else out there.

20:52.541 --> 20:55.916
-What if there's no way out?
-Well, then we're dead.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.416
Why do spiders love ghosts so much?

21:09.291 --> 21:11.583
Who cares? They're excellent warnings.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.125
-Case in point.

21:16.791 --> 21:19.083
-Oh shit.
-Sam Pandey.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.708
Probably wanted to warn us
not to go down there.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.041
And now we're going down there.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.666
-There's something waiting.

21:47.833 --> 21:50.750
This couldn't be
the actual Screaming Staircase, could it?

21:50.833 --> 21:53.916
Maybe.
Fairfax certainly loves a surprise.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.166
No wonder he did so well in show business.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.125
-Let's go.
-Okay.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.000
Fairfax and show business.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.833
<i>Mors gloria</i>

22:07.458 --> 22:10.583
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

22:11.416 --> 22:13.583
<i>Mors gloria…</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:18.208
Wait a minute. George, Lucy, hold on.
I think I might have figured out--

22:18.291 --> 22:21.625
-This is it. This is the staircase.
-Go. Get off it now!

22:25.416 --> 22:27.541
-<i>Mors gloria…</i>

22:28.125 --> 22:31.083
<i>Salvete satanas…</i>

22:31.833 --> 22:34.666
-What are we gonna do?
<i>-Mors gloria</i>

22:34.750 --> 22:37.416
<i>-Salvete satanas…</i>
-It's over.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.375
The monks.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.541
<i>-Mors gloria…</i>
-This is where they died.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.375
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

22:45.583 --> 22:48.500
<i>Mors gloria</i>

22:48.583 --> 22:51.625
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

22:52.416 --> 22:55.416
<i>Mors gloria</i>

22:55.500 --> 22:58.458
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

22:59.375 --> 23:02.208
<i>Mors gloria</i>

23:02.291 --> 23:05.291
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

23:06.041 --> 23:08.916

23:09.000 --> 23:12.208
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

23:13.125 --> 23:15.208
<i>Mors gloria</i>…

23:15.291 --> 23:19.208
<i>-Salvete satanas</i>

23:19.875 --> 23:22.041
<i>Mors gloria</i>

23:23.000 --> 23:26.500
<i>-Salvete satanas…</i>

23:26.583 --> 23:29.416
<i>Mors gloria…</i>

23:29.500 --> 23:33.750
George, find the source. Luce, help me
ward them off. We need to buy some time.

23:33.833 --> 23:37.041
What do you mean, find the source?
There's literally nothing in here!

23:37.125 --> 23:39.083
<i>Salvete satanas…</i>

23:39.583 --> 23:41.875
Oh. It's the Fittes kid!

23:41.958 --> 23:44.583
The Fittes kid is not the problem.
Come on!

23:47.750 --> 23:50.041
<i>Mors gloria</i>

23:50.750 --> 23:53.500
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

23:54.166 --> 23:56.708
<i>Mors gloria</i>

23:57.291 --> 23:59.958
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

24:01.125 --> 24:03.333
<i>Mors gloria</i>

24:04.416 --> 24:06.458
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

24:07.833 --> 24:10.416

24:11.125 --> 24:14.041
<i>Salvete satanas</i>

24:22.250 --> 24:24.541
<i>Mors gloria</i>

24:25.375 --> 24:27.125
<i>Salvete satanas…</i>

24:27.208 --> 24:28.416
Lucy, no!

24:33.500 --> 24:36.750
-You were ghost locked.
-Yeah. But I found the source.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.416
-It's in the well. Their bodies!
-It's too late.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.541
-There's too many!
-Lucky I broke the deal.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.875
<i>Salvete satanas…</i>

24:44.958 --> 24:46.000
Make a wish.

24:46.583 --> 24:48.500
<i>Mors gloria</i>

24:49.208 --> 24:52.291
<i>Salvete satanas…</i>

25:18.833 --> 25:19.791
George.

25:21.083 --> 25:21.916
George!

25:23.125 --> 25:24.000
George!

25:25.125 --> 25:26.166
Oh!

25:26.250 --> 25:27.541
Oh, are you okay?

25:28.958 --> 25:30.375
My cheek hurts.

25:31.791 --> 25:32.875
Lucy.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.208
-Lucy…
-Oh, where's his slap?

25:39.000 --> 25:43.958
I deserve one. I've been an idiot.
I should never have brought us here.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.541
There. I can't believe I missed it.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.875
Fairfax wasn't just into casinos.

25:54.416 --> 25:57.458
He was the most connected man in Soho
before he moved into iron.

25:57.541 --> 25:58.958
Fairfax knew Annabel?

25:59.041 --> 26:02.416
He didn't just know her.
I think he was with her.

26:02.916 --> 26:05.333
He gave her the ring. He must have done.

26:06.875 --> 26:11.666
That weird hallmark, that means there's
gonna be a record of him commissioning it.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.708
Wait, so… <i>he</i> killed her?

26:16.125 --> 26:17.416
And the ring's proof.

26:18.541 --> 26:21.875
I think he brought us here
for the house to kill us.

26:23.041 --> 26:27.041
It wouldn't have even been suspicious,
just three more agents dying on the job.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.541
Come on, let's get out of here.

26:29.166 --> 26:31.083
Leave before they realize
we're still alive.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.000
If we go via the Red Room,
we won't be.

26:33.083 --> 26:36.041
Look, there's light!
Maybe we can get out up there.

26:50.916 --> 26:53.083
-Go!

26:53.166 --> 26:54.458
-Run!

27:00.500 --> 27:01.875
Don't move.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.916
Hands up.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.625
You.
You brought us here to die.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.083
It was you.

27:09.166 --> 27:11.958
It was you in our house the other day
who I stabbed.

27:12.041 --> 27:13.916
There's nothing old about that war wound.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.000
There, where I can see you.

27:25.333 --> 27:28.958
I'm sure you and I
can resolve this between ourselves.

27:30.250 --> 27:33.666
You want your ring back. You thought
you could wait till the sun comes up

27:33.750 --> 27:35.916
and get it from our pockets
in the Red Room.

27:36.416 --> 27:37.500
Well, here we are.

27:38.375 --> 27:40.500
It's the hallmark that's incriminating.

27:41.875 --> 27:43.500
Something that specific.

27:43.583 --> 27:46.458
I bet you really regret
buying that for Annabel now.

27:46.541 --> 27:49.333
No. I don't regret buying it.

27:49.833 --> 27:54.458
I often regret leaving it behind
when I bricked her into that chimney.

27:55.458 --> 27:56.916
I knew it was monstrous.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.750
But I couldn't throw my whole life away
for one mistake.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.500
Not then, not now.
So lose the rapier and give me the ring.

28:07.166 --> 28:08.125
I can't.

28:09.416 --> 28:10.625
I don't have the ring.

28:11.625 --> 28:14.375
We don't travel round with it.
We're not insane.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.875
And I'm the only one
who knows where it's hidden,

28:16.958 --> 28:19.791
so if you kill me,
you will never get it back.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.000
That's a bluff.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.500
-You'd better shoot me, then.
-Lockwood, don't!

28:27.625 --> 28:30.708
You'd have fitted in well with the monks,
boy. You have a death wish.

28:30.791 --> 28:33.416
Yeah, maybe. But you're not gonna do it.

28:34.166 --> 28:37.708
You're already thinking about
the different ways you could get caught.

28:37.791 --> 28:40.291
You're just a performer too,
aren't you?

28:40.375 --> 28:43.541
Let's see what you're really made of.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.291
No.

28:49.166 --> 28:51.708
There it is. You look scared.

28:52.958 --> 28:53.875
Just like she did.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.500
Don't shoot him.

28:56.666 --> 28:59.208
This is what you want, right?

28:59.291 --> 29:01.416
-Lucy, what have you done?
-What is it?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.833
-She stole it again.
-What's in there?

29:03.916 --> 29:05.416
Lucy, what are you doing?

29:11.166 --> 29:12.416
It's Annabel's source.

29:13.250 --> 29:17.875
She's been wanting to see you
for a very long time, Mr. Fairfax.

29:17.958 --> 29:19.666
-What?
-Lucy…

29:27.708 --> 29:29.000
-Annabel!

29:33.916 --> 29:35.083
Huh?

30:42.125 --> 30:43.750
I'm working with maniacs.

30:48.416 --> 30:49.458
Hold it there!

30:53.291 --> 30:55.125
Let go! Get off of me!

31:05.000 --> 31:06.791
We're agents. This is our job.

31:06.875 --> 31:09.125
We are employed to be here.
You've no right to do this.

31:10.958 --> 31:14.833
-I gave you an order not to work.
-Yes, sir, you did, and I understand--

31:14.916 --> 31:16.083
Shut up.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.625
I knew you couldn't follow the rules,
for even one night.

31:20.625 --> 31:21.791
But you'll listen now.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.791
Anthony Lockwood, George Karim,

31:24.375 --> 31:26.000
Lucy Carlyle, I'm arresting you

31:26.083 --> 31:28.416
for conducting
an unlicensed psychical investigation

31:28.500 --> 31:30.458
in direct violation of a DEPRAC ruling.

31:30.541 --> 31:32.416
We just survived an attempted murder.

31:32.500 --> 31:36.041
John Fairfax killed Annabel Ward,
and he brought us here to kill us too.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.625
And this is the same John Fairfax

31:37.708 --> 31:40.750
who your department has been
hand in glove with for the last decade.

31:40.833 --> 31:44.291
Sir, it's true. He strangled her
and left her to rot in that chimney.

31:44.375 --> 31:48.166
-Why would I believe a word you say?
-Sir, she's not lying. We have proof.

31:48.250 --> 31:52.166
This entire job was a trap.
Ask Ellie. She heard Fairfax confess too.

31:54.708 --> 31:55.708
If this is true--

31:55.791 --> 32:00.958
Inspector Barnes? Sorry to interrupt, sir.
The deputy commissioner has just arrived.

32:04.083 --> 32:05.791
-Get 'em in the van.
-Inspector…

32:05.875 --> 32:07.458
Inspector, you have to believe me.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.833
Inspector…

32:10.041 --> 32:13.083
They're saying
you killed Sir John Fairfax.

32:13.166 --> 32:16.541
-Guess you'll make the papers after all.
-What are you even doing here?

32:16.625 --> 32:18.541
I'm Fittes's special liaison.

32:19.250 --> 32:22.750
We help keep an eye out for rogue agents.
Nice knowing you.

32:27.291 --> 32:28.625
I'll go to the papers.

32:29.416 --> 32:30.375
I'll ruin them.

32:30.458 --> 32:31.791
I'll tell everyone.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.208
Guys, get over here.

32:34.291 --> 32:35.166
What?

32:37.125 --> 32:40.041
What's the deputy commissioner
doing here at five in the morning?

32:41.833 --> 32:44.083
They're taking stuff away.
What's going on?

32:48.458 --> 32:50.833
Inspector, what the hell is happening?

32:52.833 --> 32:54.541
You're not being arrested.

32:56.416 --> 32:57.750
Not if you sign these.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.333
A non-disclosure agreement. No way.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.125
Do it.
Or you'll be completely unprotected.

33:06.208 --> 33:07.416
From what?

33:08.291 --> 33:10.458
Do you even know what's being covered up?

33:10.541 --> 33:12.791
This isn't normal.
This is against the rules.

33:12.875 --> 33:14.541
Sign the papers.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.916
First smart thing I've seen you do.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.500
-He's got your address.

33:51.916 --> 33:53.291
They took all our kit.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.333
They know something about Fairfax
we don't. They want it to stay that way.

33:57.416 --> 33:59.875
What, beyond him being a murderer?

33:59.958 --> 34:02.041
No one's ever gonna know what we did.

34:02.916 --> 34:03.833
Yeah, well,

34:05.250 --> 34:06.500
at least we're alive.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.541
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

34:28.166 --> 34:30.666
to say farewell to Samaran

34:30.750 --> 34:33.416
and to commit him into the hands of God.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.250
In life, Sam…

34:36.958 --> 34:37.875
Excuse me?

34:38.750 --> 34:39.708
Excuse me.

34:40.666 --> 34:43.083
Hi. Uh, my name's Penelope Fittes.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.958
We know who you are.

34:46.041 --> 34:49.000
And you are Lockwood & Co.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.041
At your service.

34:51.125 --> 34:53.375
You're not here to… see us, are you?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It's nice to see you, but no, no.

34:56.083 --> 35:00.083
Um, my mother led that first attempt
on Combe Carey Hall.

35:00.166 --> 35:04.416
She was the only survivor, which I think
she always felt awful about because, um…

35:06.000 --> 35:08.125
Well, Sam was like
a little brother to her.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.500
So just thank you for finding him.

35:12.416 --> 35:14.208
You must be Lucy Carlyle.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.000
You know my name?

35:16.750 --> 35:18.416
-Yep.
-Do you know my name?

35:18.500 --> 35:22.166
Well, yes, of course I do, Mr. Karim.
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.750
Wish you were still at my agency.
I fired the fool that let you go.

35:25.833 --> 35:29.666
That's a shame. She was a fool,
but she really fitted in there, actually.

35:30.166 --> 35:33.583
I could see how you might be
more comfortable where you are.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.791
Thank you again. Really.

35:38.708 --> 35:39.541
Bye.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.125
Why'd you say that? She was nice.

35:49.208 --> 35:53.750
Guys, this is no time to fight.
Penelope Fittes knows who we are!

36:00.125 --> 36:02.208
This letter from DEPRAC
is unbelievable.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.833
It's better than it could be.

36:05.666 --> 36:10.041
They're covering everything up.
Saying Fairfax died of natural causes.

36:10.125 --> 36:12.583
Well, they're trying
to protect his name, but why?

36:12.666 --> 36:16.583
Whatever he was up to, killing Annabel
Ward was clearly the tip of the iceberg.

36:17.083 --> 36:19.125
Still, at least we're getting paid.

36:19.208 --> 36:22.583
-The whole 60 grand?
-Who cares? We can't talk about it.

36:22.666 --> 36:26.375
Combe Carey Hall should be putting
our name on the front page of <i>The Times.</i>

36:26.958 --> 36:29.458
And now it's like it never even happened.

36:29.541 --> 36:31.416
Your name, you mean.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.666
Lockwood, this is great. The oversight's
been lifted. We're debt-free!

36:34.750 --> 36:36.833
We're client-free, we're reputation-free,

36:36.916 --> 36:40.000
and we've got a lot more debts
than just that 60 grand fine.

36:43.708 --> 36:46.500
George. That's evidence
you stole from the crime scene.

36:46.583 --> 36:49.291
-It needs to be kept in the safe.
-I just wanna know what it is.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.375
Why would this insignia be on those crates
and these goggles?

36:52.458 --> 36:53.583
It's fascinating.

36:53.666 --> 36:56.875
Whatever these are, they were useless
against that vicious ghost.

36:56.958 --> 37:00.000
She was brutally murdered, George.
What do you expect?

37:00.750 --> 37:05.583
And, yeah, she was scary in the end,
but I really felt like I knew her.

37:05.666 --> 37:08.125
Like she was… still alive.

37:09.666 --> 37:10.791
Watch out.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.875
Listening can screw you up.

37:12.958 --> 37:15.333
-If you're not careful, it can be--
-George!

37:17.791 --> 37:19.916
You can forget about
all of that now, Luce.

37:21.333 --> 37:23.458
Well, it worked out fine in the end.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.125
I'll stash these for you.

37:27.333 --> 37:32.083
Oh, since you're going down there,
could you pop this in secure storage?

37:38.291 --> 37:39.375
<i>You </i>signed it.

37:40.541 --> 37:41.458
Is that allowed?

37:41.541 --> 37:43.666
Judging by the face
Barnes made in the van,

37:43.750 --> 37:45.625
not even he knows what the rules are.

37:45.708 --> 37:46.666
So why not?

37:47.166 --> 37:49.291
Plus, it's my agency.

37:50.125 --> 37:51.250
You belong here.

38:26.208 --> 38:28.125
<i>Lucy…</i>

38:34.083 --> 38:35.625
<i>Lucy…</i>

38:38.750 --> 38:41.000
<i>Lucy!</i>

38:42.916 --> 38:44.375
You shouldn't have said that.

38:44.875 --> 38:46.541
About what listening can do.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.583
Well, someone has to.

38:48.666 --> 38:52.958
She got way too close to Annabel,
and… listeners can burn out.

38:53.041 --> 38:54.666
And we need to look after her.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.875
She's good, and…

38:56.625 --> 38:58.583
she's finally starting to get me.

38:59.750 --> 39:02.166
-She's a lot tougher than you think.
-Hmm.

39:04.291 --> 39:06.041
Uh-- Everything okay down there?

39:07.541 --> 39:08.708
Luce?

39:16.416 --> 39:17.500
Luce?

39:18.416 --> 39:19.416
Lucy?

39:20.958 --> 39:22.166
Everything okay?
