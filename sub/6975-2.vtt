00:05.300 --> 00:08.600
We live in a darkness
of our own making...

00:08.600 --> 00:14.000
...blind to a habitant world all
but unseen by us.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.200
A world of beings traveling
through time and space...

00:17.200 --> 00:22.200
...imaginable to us only as
flights of fancy.

00:23.400 --> 00:28.000
Who are these beings we dare
to imagine but fear to accept?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.600
What dark work goes on inside
their impossible machines...

00:32.600 --> 00:36.700
...cloaked from us by
invisible forces?

00:37.100 --> 00:40.400
If they know our secrets, ...

00:40.400 --> 00:43.900
...why can't we know theirs?

01:29.700 --> 01:32.300
Stop it! Please!

01:32.600 --> 01:35.200
Let me go! Stop it!

01:35.200 --> 01:38.200
Let me go!
Let me go!

01:38.200 --> 01:40.800
Let the boy go!

01:41.400 --> 01:43.800
Let him go, Mulder!

01:50.500 --> 01:55.000
Let him go, or I will be
compelled to use my weapon.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.400
Now, I don't want to do that,
Agent Mulder. I don't want to shoot.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.600
Now, are you armed?

02:13.900 --> 02:17.000
Come on, damn it.
This is just stupid, Agent Mulder.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.300
Don't turn this into a movie.
Just tell me if you've got a gun.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.200
It's too hot for this B.S.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.300
All right, then, lie down.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.500
Lie down on the ground.
Keep your hands out.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.400
Lay down on your belly there.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.800
For crying out loud,
what are you doing?

02:45.300 --> 02:47.800
Agent Mulder, stay there!

03:04.600 --> 03:07.400
He went over!
Over the edge!

03:07.400 --> 03:09.200
Who?

03:10.300 --> 03:12.300
Mulder.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.500
Right, I'll talk to Scully.
You guys head back to the school.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.500
Where is he?
Where's Mulder?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.200
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

03:56.200 --> 03:59.000
I heard an agent say over
the radio that you saw him.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.500
Oh, yeah, I saw him. I saw him
back right off that cliff there...

04:01.500 --> 04:04.100
...and I saw him fall
right over there.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.200
- Then where is he?
- He's gone.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.700
- Come on, he can't be gone.
- Yeah, he can't be, but he is.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.500
That cliff there?
He fell from there?

04:14.500 --> 04:17.300
It's impossible a fall like that.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.399
A cop sees things.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.900
A man drops five stories, dusts his
hat off and goes back to work.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.300
An old lady gets shot point-blank
in a Chinese restaurant, ...

04:26.300 --> 04:28.600
...plucks the slug out of her
egg foo young.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.600
But even if Mulder survives this,
what he does then is too much.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.200
You got your point of impact
there where Agent Scully is standing...

04:35.200 --> 04:36.700
...clear and identifiable.

04:36.700 --> 04:40.200
And a set of tracks here
leading down to the wash.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.100
Look at these tracks.
What do you see?

04:48.600 --> 04:51.600
Mulder was running.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
It wasn't Mulder.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.900
That's the one thing I'm sure of.

04:56.900 --> 05:00.000
It may have looked like Mulder,
but it wasn't Mulder.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.300
I told you I knew Mulder.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.600
Okay, maybe I didn't know him
that well.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.700
But I know who it was up there,
and it was Fox Mulder.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.100
I'm sure it did look like Mulder, ...

05:09.100 --> 05:12.900
...and you have every reason
to believe that it was him...

05:12.900 --> 05:15.900
...but it was not Mulder.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.500
I told you that I've seen things...

05:21.500 --> 05:24.200
Things that I can't explain.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.300
Well, I have seen what
looks like a man...

05:27.300 --> 05:30.700
...transform into another man.

05:30.700 --> 05:35.700
What looks like a man,
but who's not a man?

05:39.100 --> 05:42.900
- So, what is he?
- You don't want to know.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.800
He's not a man?
What the hell is he?

05:46.800 --> 05:51.200
Hey, don't turn your back on me.
I'm asking you a legitimate question.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.000
He's alien.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.100
He's a bounty hunter.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.300
Looking to collect a bounty on...?

06:08.400 --> 06:11.300
On Gibson Praise...

06:11.700 --> 06:14.700
...because he's part alien.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.700
He's a human anomaly.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.500
So, this alien bounty hunter...

06:22.500 --> 06:25.900
...he disguised himself as Mulder
to come out here and grab the boy?

06:25.900 --> 06:28.900
To take him back to his ship...

06:28.900 --> 06:32.300
...where we believe Mulder is.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.700
You know,
Agent Scully you're, uh, ...

06:36.700 --> 06:40.900
...you're starting to remind me a lot
of Agent Mulder yourself.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.700
Well then, you explain it to me.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.400
If it's true or possible, ...

06:52.400 --> 06:54.600
...what you're saying--
that there's someone like this out there, ...

06:54.600 --> 06:57.600
...this bounty hunter--
he could just become anyone.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.400
You, me, any damn one of us.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.400
I think that it is true.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.500
And possible.

07:08.300 --> 07:12.400
And wherever Mulder is right now...

07:12.400 --> 07:15.800
...he better damn well be smiling.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.600
Right. They're here.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Any sign of him? Mulder?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.700
Not according to these people.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.600
We went through the school.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.800
- You're better than this.
- Sir?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.700
He's got to be here somewhere.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.100
Let's search the school again.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.900
Hello?

08:49.100 --> 08:52.200
Sorry, I thought you were...

08:52.200 --> 08:56.200
I thought they cleared
you out of here.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.500
Find something?

08:59.200 --> 09:03.100
No. Let's keep looking.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.700
<i>- Administration building is clear.
- Copy, check it again.</i>

09:25.800 --> 09:28.700
What I want to know is
how Doggett got out here.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.300
How did he even know
where we were going?

09:30.300 --> 09:31.600
I don't know.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.400
But he's going to turn this place
upside down looking for the wrong person.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.100
What happened to Gibson Praise?

09:37.100 --> 09:41.500
Whatever happened to him,
he's long gone.

09:41.500 --> 09:45.500
Wherever he is,
he's three steps ahead of us.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.300
Don't look now but we've
got a pair of eyeballs on us.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.300
Just start walking,
I'll be right behind you.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.600
Can I talk to you for a minute?

12:25.600 --> 12:28.600
You shouldn't have come here.

12:36.600 --> 12:40.100
You shouldn't have come.
You'll lead them to me.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.200
I'm here to protect you, Gibson.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.100
I know you know that's
the truth.

12:49.100 --> 12:51.700
I know you know my thoughts.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.800
I know they took the man
you work with ... Mulder.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.300
And now, they've come to take me.

13:01.500 --> 13:05.000
The only reason they want
to take you, Gibson...

13:05.000 --> 13:08.900
...is because you're a special boy.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.700
They want to take you
because of what you are.

13:12.700 --> 13:17.100
I'm sorry. I didn't know that
someone was following me.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.900
My friend Thea knows.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.700
She's the only one
at school I've told.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.700
She says the FBI is
looking for me, too.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.600
She's afraid for me.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.100
She has a right to be afraid.

13:32.100 --> 13:35.800
We don't know who to trust now.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.200
I fell when I was running away.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.700
I think you might
have broken it, Gibson.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.400
If they find me,
they'll take me. I know it.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.200
I've always known it.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.400
I'm going to make you
a splint, Gibson, okay?

13:57.700 --> 14:01.800
I can set your leg,
but, uh...

14:01.800 --> 14:06.100
I'm going to need a car
to get you out of here.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.400
I'm going to come back
for you.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.900
I promise.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.200
I'm not going to let anything
bad happen to you.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.200
You said that to me
once before.

14:41.400 --> 14:45.000
Yeah?
Deputy Director, for you.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.200
Yeah, this is John Doggett.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.100
Agent Doggett,
I'm getting reports from Arizona...

14:51.100 --> 14:52.100
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:52.100 --> 14:54.200
...That you found Agent Mulder.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.900
I'm afraid somebody jumped the gun
on that. I saw him, sir, but I...

14:56.900 --> 14:59.300
<i>What do you mean,
you saw him?</i>

14:59.300 --> 15:01.800
What the hell is going on
out there?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.200
Well, we're 'round the
clock here.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.600
I've got local SAR, a rolling
ground cordon and an eye in the sky.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.900
- We're on top of the situation.
- How does the FBI...

15:10.900 --> 15:17.700
...find a man and then lose him
in the middle of the desert?

15:17.700 --> 15:21.000
'Cause I'd like to know.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
<i>- Agent Doggett, are you there?
- Yeah. I heard the question.</i>

15:24.000 --> 15:26.400
<i>I put you in charge
out there, Doggett.</i>

15:26.400 --> 15:29.400
Now do the damn job.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.200
This amuse you?
I amuse you?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.000
No.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.300
It just made sense to me.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.300
How you found your way out here.
Who led you to Gibson Praise.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.100
You think I was spying on you?

15:49.100 --> 15:51.800
No, but I think our new
Deputy Director was.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.800
You're being made a pawn
in a rigged game.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.100
All right, you've painted me the picture,
now put it in a frame.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.800
All right.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.000
You've got a good rep,
Agent Doggett.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.300
You don't compromise,
you don't quit.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.300
You're a damned good FBI agent--
best of the best.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.600
Lot of guys put you in the
Director's chair one day.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.200
Which is why you've been
set up to fail.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.600
There's no amount of search and
rescue or rolling cordons...

16:22.600 --> 16:24.700
...or eyes in the sky that are
going to turn up Mulder.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.500
It's just the wrong approach.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.000
It's not a question of approach.
It's the only approach I got.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.400
The only way you're going to
find Mulder is to give into the truth.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.600
To listen to Scully.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.700
But even then...
say you did find him, ...

16:41.700 --> 16:44.500
...even then you lose.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.400
You put anything about
aliens or...

16:48.400 --> 16:52.600
...UFOs or alien bounty hunters
in your report...

16:53.300 --> 16:56.300
...Kersh will ruin you.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.700
I'm betting that was his plan.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.599
Is Agent Scully here?

17:08.599 --> 17:11.099
Where's Agent Scully?

17:13.200 --> 17:17.400
I need someone who's with
Agent Scully to put her on a radio.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.900
Someone... with Agent Scully.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.400
<i>Anyone got a twenty
on Agent Scully?</i>

17:27.400 --> 17:30.300
<i>Is anyone out there with her?</i>

17:34.500 --> 17:36.800
I'm with Agent Scully.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.300
Then who's this?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.500
<i>Go for Agent Scully.</i>

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
What?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.900
Give me the radio.

17:54.300 --> 17:57.700
- You're with Scully?
- Right across the room from her.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.800
From who? From me?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.600
Where?

18:02.600 --> 18:05.800
<i>- What room? Where are you?
- Bunkhouse.</i>

18:05.800 --> 18:07.200
We're in the dorm.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.300
Tell him to hold her.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.300
Tell them not to let
her out of his sight!

18:12.300 --> 18:14.800
Hold Scully.
We're coming to you.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.700
Agent Scully--

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
There she is.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.000
Do you see her?

19:03.500 --> 19:06.100
Where did she go?
Did you see her?

19:06.100 --> 19:07.500
No.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.300
She ran right back here!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.300
I saw her!

19:13.800 --> 19:15.800
You saw her!

19:30.200 --> 19:32.800
Agent...  Can you breathe?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.300
He thinks it was me.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.700
He thinks that I did
this to him.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.400
How is that possible?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
It's someone in this room.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.300
Agent Scully?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.400
Where are you going?

22:14.300 --> 22:16.300
Agent Scully?

22:22.500 --> 22:25.000
Get out of the car.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
Agent Scully!

22:32.900 --> 22:35.900
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.100
Drop your weapon and
turn around.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.100
- I'm not gonna turn around.
- Just do it!

22:40.100 --> 22:42.100
I know how it works--

22:42.100 --> 22:44.000
Kill shot to the back
of the neck.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.800
Scully, you're pointing
your weapon at a friend.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.100
Turn around, ...

22:48.100 --> 22:50.600
...or I'm going to assume that
you're not who you say you are.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.100
Scully, it's me!
Skinner!

23:19.200 --> 23:21.700
I can prove it.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.300
I know your secret--
who else knows it?

23:29.000 --> 23:33.100
Okay...  then tell me.

23:33.600 --> 23:38.800
You tell me.
How do I know it's you?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.800
I don't like pointing guns
at pregnant women...

23:46.800 --> 23:51.100
...any more than I like them
pointing guns at me.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.800
This has gone too far, Scully.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.400
No.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.800
That's what's wrong here.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.200
It hasn't gone far enough.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.800
I need those car keys.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.700
And what do you think
you're going to do?

24:21.700 --> 24:25.000
Look, we are being
hampered here by the FBI, ...

24:25.000 --> 24:29.000
...by John Doggett, by doubt,
by our own mistrust.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.200
Whatever it is, it is working...
as long as we let it.

24:32.200 --> 24:36.700
You told me Mulder wouldn't
allow it.

24:36.700 --> 24:41.700
Wouldn't let me ruin my career
over this. Over him.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.400
But what about you, Scully?

24:46.400 --> 24:51.000
I mean, my God,
you've got even more at stake.

24:57.900 --> 25:01.900
I can't take the chance that
I'm never going to see him again.

25:01.900 --> 25:05.800
Mulder could just come walking out
of the dark-- we don't know.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.900
Look... we've got one last
chance here...

25:09.900 --> 25:14.200
...waiting for us out there
in the desert--

25:14.800 --> 25:18.000
Gibson Praise.

25:19.200 --> 25:23.700
It may just be who
gets to him first.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.800
Get in the car.
I'll drive.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.100
Gibson!

26:26.300 --> 26:28.600
He's not down there.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.200
I told him to stay here.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.600
He was supposed to stay here.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.700
I found him.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.900
What are you doing
out here?

26:54.900 --> 26:57.900
Why didn't you answer me, huh?

26:59.100 --> 27:02.000
He's here.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.800
I hear him.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.200
What are you talking about?

27:18.600 --> 27:21.500
Mulder.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.700
He's somewhere out there.

27:26.600 --> 27:30.300
He's got a really bad fever.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.400
I think his leg might
be infected.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.600
All right, we got to get you
to the hospital, okay, buddy?

27:38.200 --> 27:41.600
You're so close now.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.600
I'll carry you.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.600
Put your arm around
my neck. Watch your legs.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.700
Agent Scully.

27:57.700 --> 28:01.700
- You take him to the hospital.
- What about you?

28:17.600 --> 28:21.100
I got a boy here who needs
emergency medical attention!

28:50.600 --> 28:52.700
What?

28:53.200 --> 28:56.200
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

29:03.500 --> 29:07.500
It's okay, Gibson,
lie down. Lie down.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.200
Oh, my God.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.200
For someone who claims
he's not following me, ...

31:52.200 --> 31:54.500
...you sure have a knack.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.300
- Hey, you're where the action is.
- What does that tell you?

31:57.300 --> 31:59.600
That I'm crazy or that I'm right?

31:59.600 --> 32:03.600
Wandering around in the desert
in the dead of night, you call it.

32:04.300 --> 32:08.100
You say you want to find Mulder
but you won't do what it takes.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.800
- You're afraid that I'm right.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.300
Except that maybe Mulder's got
even you believing in this crap now.

32:15.300 --> 32:18.300
You've seen this crap
for yourself now.

32:18.300 --> 32:22.300
How do you explain what
took place today?

32:22.300 --> 32:25.100
Let me ask you something
hypothetically.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.200
If you were to find him
out here...

32:27.200 --> 32:30.600
...or this ship or this
alien bounty hunter, ...

32:30.600 --> 32:32.300
...what would you do then?

32:32.300 --> 32:35.000
I know what Agent Mulder would do.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.200
- He'd do whatever it took.
- You mean lie.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.000
Like you've been lying to me.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.600
And flout orders like
you've done...

32:41.600 --> 32:43.300
...every step of the way
on this thing.

32:43.300 --> 32:44.600
Is that what it takes, Agent Scully?

32:44.600 --> 32:46.700
Give a little, get a little,
Agent Doggett!

32:46.700 --> 32:47.900
You knew where the kid was, ...

32:47.900 --> 32:49.800
...you knew where the kid was
and you wouldn't tell me-- why?

32:49.800 --> 32:53.600
- What kid? I don't see any kid.
- You're lying to me again!

32:53.600 --> 32:58.000
Assistant Director Skinner took
him from here to the hospital.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.800
How do you know that?

33:10.200 --> 33:13.000
There's one thing I know
for sure in this case...

33:13.000 --> 33:15.600
...and that's that Mulder is
after this boy Gibson Praise.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.600
Why? It beats the
hell out of me.

33:17.600 --> 33:22.600
But when he goes after that kid,
my men are going to be waiting for him.

33:22.900 --> 33:27.900
Your men... followed
Assistant Director Skinner?

33:32.100 --> 33:34.400
Hey, where you going?

33:34.400 --> 33:37.900
- Agent Scully, where you going?
- Your men are at the hospital?

33:37.900 --> 33:38.900
They got it controlled.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.900
Nobody goes in or out of that
building without them knowing about it.

33:40.900 --> 33:45.900
How do you know that
they're your men?

34:33.400 --> 34:34.600
Where's the boy?

34:34.600 --> 34:37.600
Door at the end of the hall,
with AD Skinner.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.100
Are you certain about that?

34:42.100 --> 34:44.400
Why don't you get yourself
a visual in the exterior window.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.199
The night nurse has been checking
the boy every 20 minutes-- he's fine.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.400
We have hospital personnel going
about their business.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.400
We're just laying back,
waiting for Mulder.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.699
Yeah, every minute that you wait,
that boy's in danger.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.199
He's exposed.

34:55.199 --> 34:58.300
No one's getting past us,
Agent Scully.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.600
No one's gotten past us.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.600
You believe that, Agent Doggett?

35:18.400 --> 35:22.000
Hey, if something tries to rip
your throat out, I got you covered.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.700
A.D. Skinner...

35:29.500 --> 35:32.000
This is John Doggett.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.400
What the hell is this?

35:40.400 --> 35:43.700
- What the hell is going on?!
- There's no one in that room.

35:48.600 --> 35:53.100
I'm looking for a patient,
a boy, 12 years old.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.800
He may still be in this building.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.300
The window doesn't
even open.

36:05.300 --> 36:09.800
How's a grown man and a boy get out
of the room except by that door?

36:20.800 --> 36:23.000
Agent Scully.

36:23.700 --> 36:27.900
It's okay, I've got him.
Gibson.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.000
How did you get here?

36:35.200 --> 36:37.300
How did you get him
out of that room?

36:37.300 --> 36:40.400
We went up through the ceiling.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.900
I don't know who to trust.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.000
Where is he?

36:48.200 --> 36:50.700
He's right here.

36:53.900 --> 36:57.100
They're going to find him.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.300
Agent Scully!

38:11.700 --> 38:14.200
An agent needs help!

38:34.400 --> 38:37.400
I said an agent needs help!

39:17.100 --> 39:21.000
The best I can say is it's lucky
it all happened at a hospital.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.200
Very lucky, yes, Sir.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.300
I assume the hazardous
materials or chemicals...

39:26.300 --> 39:29.800
...which caused this must
have been medical.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.500
That has not yet been determined, Sir.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.800
So much here is undetermined...

39:35.800 --> 39:39.600
...as remain the whereabouts
of Mulder.

39:39.600 --> 39:44.100
But some of your ... facts...

39:44.100 --> 39:48.200
...like "a man falls from the
cliff and disappears..."

39:48.200 --> 39:51.900
"An agent has his throat crushed
by an assailant...

39:51.900 --> 39:55.500
...who vanishes into thin air."

39:55.500 --> 39:58.700
This reads like a piece of
pot-boiled science fiction.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.700
You mean it reads like an X-File.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.900
But that's what you intended,
wasn't it, Sir?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.800
When you assigned me to the case.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.200
I'll ask the questions, John.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.200
You just give me some
damn answers.

40:18.200 --> 40:22.000
Don't come back until you do.

40:41.200 --> 40:44.800
My dad always said it's
not who wins or loses...

40:44.800 --> 40:48.300
...it's who takes the worst
beating that counts.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.500
That supposed to cheer me up?

40:50.500 --> 40:52.600
I thought so.

40:52.600 --> 40:56.600
But then I never did get
to see your opponent.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.000
And you never will.

41:00.200 --> 41:03.000
You still don't believe me.

41:03.400 --> 41:07.500
What I don't believe is how long
they're keeping you here.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.500
Oh, it's just some things they
have to check out...

41:10.500 --> 41:13.100
...make sure of.

41:13.100 --> 41:17.100
Well, I've got some things
I thought you'd want checked out.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.100
A.D. Skinner is in stable condition, ...

41:20.100 --> 41:24.200
...resting comfortably and awaiting
diagnosis and further study.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.200
Ditto Agent Landau, his throat.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.000
Gibson Praise is right now a
ward of the state...

41:30.000 --> 41:31.900
...but I asked for special protections, ...

41:31.900 --> 41:35.100
...as I assumed you would yourself.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.100
What are you doing here,
Agent Doggett?

41:38.100 --> 41:41.100
Keeping you apprised of the case.

41:41.100 --> 41:43.600
That's not your job.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.100
It is, actually.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.800
And officially.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.900
I'm...

41:52.900 --> 41:56.400
...assigned now to the X-Files.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.700
Whatever you and I
may differ on, ...

42:13.700 --> 42:17.000
...I'll find him, Agent Scully.
