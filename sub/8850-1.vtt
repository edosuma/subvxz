00:43.344 --> 00:46.347
IT'S BEEN A LONG WINTER,
SON.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.818
STRETCH OUT ON YOUR BUNK.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.688
GET SOME SLEEP.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.091
- [sniffles and groans]

00:57.191 --> 00:58.226
GO AWAY, DOC.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.827
YOU A--YOU AIN'T REAL.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.730
YOU AIN'T REAL.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.238
- YOUR CANDLE IS
BURNING LOW, CULLEN.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.777
SOON IT'S GONNA GO OUT.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.115
[blast of air]

01:24.185 --> 01:27.521
- THAT'S JUST THE WIND.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.558
WHAT THAT WAS,
THAT WAS JUST THE WIND.

GET OUT OF HERE!

03:27.975 --> 03:29.910
GET OUT OF HERE!

03:30.010 --> 03:33.947
GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU MISERABLE SON OF A BITCH!

03:35.549 --> 03:38.552
GET OFF MY DAMN RAILROAD.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.725
OFF MY DAMN RAILROAD.

[background chatter,

07:40.661 --> 07:43.931
YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S A NIGGER
WITH A MARKED-UP WHITE WOMAN?

07:44.031 --> 07:46.634
- HE'S--HE'S DOWN THERE
BEHIND THE SAWMILL.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.668

07:56.777 --> 07:57.745
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.479
- YUP.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.115
- HEARD YOU FROZE UP SOLID.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.817
- THANKS FOR LOOKING IN.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.487
- SHUT THE DOOR!

08:07.588 --> 08:09.489
- WOMAN'S SUFFERING.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.958
- BABY NEAR?

08:11.058 --> 08:12.793
- MM-HMM.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.528
- BABY'S GONNA COME
WHETHER YOU'RE HERE OR NOT.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.930
- WHAT THE HELL
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.098
- I NEED YOU TO COME
WITH ME TO NEW YORK.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.700
RAILROAD BUSINESS.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.669
- RIGHT NOW I AIN'T GOT
NO STAKE IN NO RAILROAD.

08:21.769 --> 08:25.739
- WELL, I'M THE RAILROAD BOSS,
AND THIS HERE'S A RAILROAD TOWN.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.175
COME WITH ME NOW OR YOU DON'T BE
HERE WHEN I COME BACK THROUGH.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.845
- TAKE YOUR TALK OUTSIDE,
PLEASE.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.190
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

08:45.826 --> 08:49.029
- WATCH OVER ME WHILE I SLEEP.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.731
- AGAINST WHO?

08:50.831 --> 08:53.767
- SOME YOU CAN SEE,
SOME YOU CAN'T.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.836
- YOU LOST YOUR MIND
IN THAT SNOW.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.838
YOU CRAZY.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.942
- ON THE CONTRARY,
MY NEGRO FRIEND...

09:02.042 --> 09:05.713
I HAVE NEVER
BEEN THINKING MORE CLEARLY.

09:05.813 --> 09:08.548
SAY YOUR PIECE, GET YOUR COAT.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.818
TRAIN'S WAITING.

[door opens]

09:16.757 --> 09:18.759
- I HEARD.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.130
GO.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.606
- I CAN'T LEAVE YOU LIKE THIS.
- WELL, HE'S RIGHT.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.642
THE BABY'S GONNA
COME EITHER WAY.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.678
- YEAH.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.814
I WANNA BE HERE FOR IT.
- I SAID GO.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.685
BIRTHING AIN'T
A MAN'S BUSINESS.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.721
BEST THING YOU CAN DO
IS GET US A JOB.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.823
- MM.

10:05.405 --> 10:09.076
[background chatter]

10:14.414 --> 10:17.651
- HEY, BOY.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.187
THE NEGRO CAR'S TWO CARS DOWN.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.255
- THIS IS WHERE I AIM TO BE.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.224
- NOW, DON'T MAKE ME
THROW YOU OFF THIS TRAIN.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.760
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S MINE.

[goat bleats]

11:10.303 --> 11:12.973
[men shouting in background]

11:15.475 --> 11:18.078
- HOW COME YOU SHOW UP NOW?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.379
- STOPPED SNOWING.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.915
[horn blows]

11:23.751 --> 11:26.754
- WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED TO YOUR EAR?

11:28.521 --> 11:31.058
- SOME TRESPASSERS.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.024
- COME ON.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.761
- MR. BOHANNON?

12:09.997 --> 12:12.465
I'M CLEMENT BEALE,
SECRETARY OF CREDIT MOBILIER.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.434
- GOOD, YOU GOT MY TELEGRAM.
LET'S GO.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.436
- MR. BOHANNON, I'M AFRAID
YOU'VE MADE A TRIP FOR NAUGHT.

12:16.536 --> 12:20.440
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"FOR NAUGHT"?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.810
- THE BOARD OF CREDIT MOBILIER

12:22.910 --> 12:24.444
AND THE UNDERSECRETARY
OF RAILROADS

12:24.544 --> 12:27.147
HAS ALREADY FILLED THE POSITION
OF CHIEF ENGINEER LAST MONTH.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.216
I TRIED ANSWERING
YOUR TELEGRAM.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.084
- I KNEW THIS WAS SNAKEBIT.
- NOW HOLD ON.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.821
SENATOR HOWARD HISSELF
OFFERED ME THAT JOB LAST FALL.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.389
- SENATOR HOWARD
LOST HIS BID FOR REELECTION.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.291
FRANKLY, MR. BOHANNON,

12:38.391 --> 12:39.927
WORD CAME BACK TO US THAT
YOU DIDN'T SURVIVE THE WINTER.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.296
- WORD WAS WRONG.
- YES, WELL, THANKFULLY SO,

12:43.396 --> 12:45.833
BUT THE DECISION
HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.434
- I'M HERE TO UNMAKE IT.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.437
IS DURANT BACK IN?
IS THAT IT?

12:50.537 --> 12:53.173
- NO. MR. DURANT
IS STILL IN HUDSON PRISON.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.374
- SHOW ME A TRAIN
BACK TO OMAHA.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.076
- YOU HOLD YOUR DAMN HORSES.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.512
YOU TAKE ME TO SEE
DURANT RIGHT NOW.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.214
- I WON'T
IF THIS IS A VENDETTA.

13:01.314 --> 13:05.185
- NOT ALL AT ONCE IT AIN'T.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.519
[cane bangs]

13:06.619 --> 13:09.122
- I'LL HAVE
SOME HOT WATER FOR TEA.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.958
- A VISITOR, MR. DURANT.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.492
- HMM?

13:17.430 --> 13:20.267
GOOD GOD.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.202
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.238
- YET HERE I STAND.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.044
- AND WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.314
OH, WAIT, DON'T TELL ME.
NO.

13:34.414 --> 13:38.018
YOU'VE COME TO GLOAT.
- NO, SIR.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.120
- NO.
[laughs]

13:40.220 --> 13:43.556
NO. GLOATING IS NOT
IN YOUR CHARACTER,

13:43.656 --> 13:46.359
IS IT, BOHANNON?

13:46.459 --> 13:49.062
TOO MUCH INTEGRITY.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.099
THAT WAS ALWAYS YOUR PROBLEM.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.236
- I CAME TO ASK FOR HELP.
- [scoffs]

13:56.336 --> 13:58.271
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?

13:58.371 --> 13:59.873
I'M RUINED.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.843
THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD POSSIBLY DO FOR YOU.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.479
EVEN IF I WANTED TO.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.847
- UNION PACIFIC
OFFERED ME A JOB,

14:07.948 --> 14:11.051
AND THEY GAVE IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.185
I NEED YOU TO TELL 'EM
I'M THEIR MAN.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.286
I NEED YOU TO VOUCH FOR ME.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.122
- VOUCH FOR YOU?
[chuckles]

14:15.222 --> 14:18.458
THOSE SPINELESS,
MYOPIC WEASELS

14:18.558 --> 14:21.494
ARE IN NO MOOD
TO LISTEN TO ME.

14:23.030 --> 14:26.366
YOU'VE LOST YOUR NERVE.

14:26.466 --> 14:31.038
NOT SO SURE YOU ACTUALLY
CAN RUN THE RAILROAD.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.105
AND ONCE UPON A TIME,

14:32.205 --> 14:35.275
I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU COULD.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.311
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.
YOU'RE SCARED.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.985
- I CAME TO SEE YOU BEHIND BARS
FOR WHAT YOU DONE.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.089
- THERE WAS A TIME
YOU COULD HAVE DONE IT.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.890
WHEN I WAS YOUR CHAMPION.

14:50.991 --> 14:54.894
WHEN I WAS YOUR ADVOCATE.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.530
NOW LOOK AT YOU.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.367
YOU'RE TRAGIC.

15:00.467 --> 15:05.005
YOUR HOUR HAS PASSED.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.340
- YOUR RAILROAD WILL FAIL
WITHOUT ME.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.476
- IT'S NO LONGER
MY RAILROAD.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.645
FOR NOW.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.048
THE BOARD WON'T ACCEPT YOU.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.551
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

15:18.651 --> 15:21.554
BECAUSE YOU ARE
NOT ONE OF US.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.992
YOU WILL NEVER BE
FROM MASSACHUSETTS OR NEW YORK.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.694
YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE FROM MISSISSIPPI.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.601
YOU SUFFER FROM
A PREPOSTEROUS MISCALCULATION

15:34.701 --> 15:37.971
OF POSSIBILITIES.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.541
LIKE ALL SOUTHERNERS,
YOU'RE DELUDED.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.051
AND YOU SMELL.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.733
[background chatter]

16:12.272 --> 16:14.274
- [sighs]

16:28.621 --> 16:31.324
- WHAT TYPE OF DRESSING
ARE YOU REQUIRING TODAY?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.293
- BUSINESS.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.727
- WHAT TYPE OF BUSINESS
MIGHT IT BE?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.564
- RAILROAD, BUT CUT THE TOP
AND THE OVERCOAT,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.532
SO I CAN WEAR THIS.
- VERY GOOD.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.234
MAYBE AN OPEN FROCK
WITH A FULLER WAIST?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.470
- SOUNDS RIGHT.
INCH OR TWO OF THE CUFF SHOWING,

16:43.570 --> 16:45.138
NEAT IN THE PANTS,
AND I DRESS TO THE LEFT.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.141
[door bell jingles]

16:48.241 --> 16:51.178
- AND THE GENTLEMAN'S
GENTLEMAN?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.648
- HOW COME I GOTTA BE
A GENTLEMAN'S GENTLEMAN?

16:55.748 --> 16:58.051
WHY CAN'T I BE
A GENTLEMAN PLAIN?

16:58.151 --> 17:00.019
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HE'S RIGHT.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.756
WAR'S GIVEN THE NEGRO THE RIGHT
TO DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS, SO...

17:03.856 --> 17:06.793
WHAT TYPE OF SUIT
WILL YOU HAVE, SIR?

17:06.893 --> 17:09.262
- LET'S SEE.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.702
- THAT ONE THERE,
I CAN AFFORD.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.178
- YEAH, I LIKE THAT ONE.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.647
MAKE THAT ONE UP FOR ME.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.250
- THE BLACK MAN CHOOSES,
AND THE WHITE MAN PAYS.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.186
IT'S A NEW RECKONING
OF THE WORLD, MR. COLLIER.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.787
- THAT IT IS,
MR. BOHANNON.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.356
- AND YOU, SIR?

17:36.456 --> 17:37.624
WHAT SIDE DO YOU DRESS ON?

17:37.724 --> 17:40.660
- WHAT YOU MEAN
WHAT SIDE I DRESS ON?

17:40.760 --> 17:43.230
- PSST.
HEY.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.606
- THANK YOU,
MR. BOHANNON.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.508
AND WHEN YOU'RE HIRING MEN
FOR YOUR RAILROAD,

17:55.608 --> 17:57.344
DON'T FORGET
YOUR IRISH KINSMEN.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.678
- WHEN I LAND THIS JOB,
I'LL NEED TWO OR THREE.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.180
THAT'S FOR SURE.
- HUNDRED?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.814
- THOUSAND.
- AH.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.650
THE MAN YOU'LL NEED TO SEE
IS THREE-PIECE DUFFY

18:03.750 --> 18:04.717
DOWN AT THE POINTS.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.453
HE KNOWS ALL THE RAILROAD MEN.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.256
IF YOU'RE WITH THE UNION
PACIFIC, HE'LL FIND YA.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.557
- HE AIN'T WITH NOBODY.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.726
HE BARELY WITH ME.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.297
- OH, MR. BOHANNON.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.632
- BURN IT.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.669
BUT SHOOT IT FIRST.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.119
- I THINK I DRESS
TO THE RIGHT.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.425
- CULLEN BOHANNON.
THE BOARD'S EXPECTING ME.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.660
- ELAM FERGUSON.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.434
- THIS WAY, SIR.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.243
- MR. BOHANNON.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.778
WE APPRECIATE ALL YOU'VE DONE
FOR THE RAILROAD.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.381
BOTH DOC DURANT
AND THE LATE MRS. LILY BELL

19:08.481 --> 19:10.850
SPOKE HIGHLY OF
YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS AND ABILITIES.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.387
- LET'S GO TO IT THEN.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.556
- THE JOB OF CHIEF ENGINEER
AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT

19:16.656 --> 19:19.226
OF UNION PACIFIC HAS BEEN
AWARDED TO SOMEONE ELSE.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.260
- YES, SIR.

19:20.360 --> 19:21.294
AND I AIM FOR IT TO BE MINE

19:21.394 --> 19:22.662
BEFORE I WALK OUT THAT DOOR.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.532
WHAT'S IT A QUESTION OF?
- VISION.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.367
- AND TEMPERAMENT.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.237
SOMEONE WHOSE PEDIGREE
SPEAKS TO GETTING THINGS DONE

19:30.337 --> 19:34.841
IN WASHINGTON
AS WELL AS OUT ON THE PLAINS.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.778
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO WASHINGTON, MR. BOHANNON?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.513
- I AM FAMILIAR.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.648
- WELL, THEN YOU KNOW

19:41.748 --> 19:43.416
THAT EVEN AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS,

19:43.516 --> 19:45.885
IT'S DOG EAT DOG.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.622
- THIS MAN YOU HIRED,
HE'S A REAL DOG FIGHTER THEN?

19:49.722 --> 19:53.426
- HE COMES
WITH MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.295
HE WAS THE CHIEF ENGINEER

19:55.395 --> 19:57.464
OF THE WESTWOOD
AND UPCLAIR RAILWAY.

19:57.564 --> 20:01.368
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A SHORTLINE RAILROAD TO ME.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.703
- 16 MILES,
BUT HE OVERSAW

20:03.803 --> 20:05.772
THE BUILDING
OF TWO MAJOR TRESTLES.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.276
- YES, YOUR SON-IN-LAW
COMES WELL-APPOINTED.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.610
ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR NEW ROLE

20:10.710 --> 20:13.346
AS UNDERSECRETARY
OF THE RAILROAD.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.248
- AND HE'S A VETERAN.

20:15.348 --> 20:18.885
FOUGHT WITH BLACK DAVE HUNTER
ON THE WINNING SIDE.

20:24.624 --> 20:28.395
- ALL DUE RESPECT, I DON'T
DOUBT YOUR SON-IN-LAW'S ABILITY

20:28.495 --> 20:31.931
TO BUILD PRETTY BRIDGES
OVER STONY BROOK STREAMS,

20:32.031 --> 20:32.932
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE'RE FACING

20:33.032 --> 20:36.869
OUT WEST AT THE MOMENT.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.505
IS THIS THE BEST MAP
YOU HAVE?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.507
- IT'S CURRENT.
- IT'S NOT VERY ACCURATE.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.409
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.010
PLAINS EXTEND HERE.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.912
HERE'S THE BEGINNING
OF THE RED DESERT.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.414
NOW WE'LL BE GOOD
ALONG HERE.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.781
PLENTY OF GRAZING
FOR OUR FEED CATTLE,

20:48.881 --> 20:50.517
MILD WEATHER.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.752
HERE'S WHERE WE START
RUNNING OUT OF WATER.

20:52.852 --> 20:57.957
I'VE DRAWN UP SOME DESIGNS...
FOR WATER CARS.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.261
HERE ARE SOME DESIGNS
FOR DORMITORY CARS.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.864
KEEP THE MEN
OUT OF THE ELEMENTS, HEALTHIER,

21:04.964 --> 21:07.467
MORE PRODUCTIVE.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.601
- WHO WILL BUILD THESE?

21:08.701 --> 21:09.936
- WE'LL BUILD 'EM TOGETHER,

21:10.036 --> 21:11.971
JUST LIKE WE'LL BUILD
THIS RAILROAD.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.040
NOW HERE WE START HITTING
REAL INDIAN COUNTRY HARD.

21:14.140 --> 21:18.445
SHOSHONE, CROW, KIOWA--
SOME FRIENDLY, SOME NOT.

21:18.545 --> 21:21.848
OH, UM, YOUR SON-IN-LAW,

21:21.948 --> 21:25.885
HAS HE EVER BEEN
IN INDIAN TERRITORY?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.623
- WE'VE STARTED STOCKPILING
RAIL AND TIES HERE,

21:30.723 --> 21:32.058
WAITING FOR THE MISSOURI
TO THAW.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.427
- MM-MM, RIVER'S ALREADY
BREAKING UP HERE SOUTH.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.995
SAW IT MYSELF COMING OVER.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.797
- CENTRAL PACIFIC
WAS ABLE TO WORK

21:37.897 --> 21:38.798
THROUGH MOST OF THE WINTER.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.768
COLLIS HUNTINGTON

21:41.868 --> 21:43.970
HAS PUT THEM
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.038
- THEN THE RACE IS ON,
GENTLEMEN.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.774
NO TIME TO WASTE.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.543
NOW THIS...

21:50.643 --> 21:53.045
THESE ARE PLANS FOR ORGANIZING
THE RAIL-LAYERS AND TIE CREWS.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.748
THINK WE CAN GET
MORE STEEL LAID.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.685
PROBABLY 30% MORE STEEL

21:58.785 --> 22:01.754
IF WE FOLLOW THESE REGIMENS.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.890
[men murmuring]

22:10.997 --> 22:14.967
- WERE WE TO TAKE YOU ON
IN SOME CAPACITY,

22:15.067 --> 22:16.769
YOU'D BE PAID IN U.P. STOCK.

22:16.869 --> 22:19.572
WE FEEL THAT THAT WOULD
MAKE YOUR INVOLVEMENT

22:19.672 --> 22:22.509
MORE OF A PERSONAL INVESTMENT.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.412
- CONGRESSMAN AMES...

22:25.512 --> 22:28.648
I'M ALREADY MORE INVESTED
THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.083
THERE'S A LOT OF GRAVES
ALONG THIS RAILROAD,

22:31.183 --> 22:32.819
MARKED AND UNMARKED.

22:32.919 --> 22:38.491
SOME I LAID TO REST MYSELF
AND SOME--HA.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.661
POINT IS...

22:41.761 --> 22:45.898
I MAKE NO APOLOGIES
FOR MY TEMPERAMENT.

22:45.998 --> 22:50.369
- MR. BOHANNON,
I BELIEVE YOU'RE BLEEDING.

22:50.470 --> 22:54.541
- SURELY NOT FROM SHAKING HANDS
WITH A SHAVING RAZOR.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.676
- WOLVES, ACTUALLY.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.514
THE KIND THAT BITE.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.393
- WHY DON'T YOU SHAKE HANDS
WITH THE NEW CHIEF ENGINEER

23:14.494 --> 23:15.695
OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD?

23:15.795 --> 23:18.698
- I'D RATHER SHAKE HANDS
WITH THE DEVIL.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.433
- YOU MAY WELL
BEFORE THIS IS OVER.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.702
- YOU MADE 'EM THINK
I WAS YOUR BUTLER OR SOMETHING?

23:22.802 --> 23:24.704
- I DID, AND IT WORKED.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.873
GOT THE JOB.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.909
NOW WE GOT MEN TO HIRE.
LET'S GO.

23:30.009 --> 23:33.513
[men and women shouting]

23:39.886 --> 23:42.822
- I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.858
SAFER BACK HOME
WITH THEM INDIANS.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.595
- MEET ME BACK AT THE HOTEL
IF WE GET SPLIT UP.

23:48.695 --> 23:52.198
- I'M ON YOU LIKE A TICK.

24:05.144 --> 24:09.148
- SHOW THESE LADS
THEIR PLACE OF NEW EMPLOY.

24:12.284 --> 24:16.122
CAUGHT A MUSKET BALL AT
A BOWERY PARTY THE OTHER NIGHT.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.457
IT'S FESTERING A BIT.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.459
"EITHER THE BALL COMES OUT
OR THE LEG COMES OFF,"

24:20.560 --> 24:22.461
SAYS THE BARBER.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.631
PARDON THE SMELL.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.098
- I'M CULLEN BOHANNON,

24:26.198 --> 24:28.601
NEW CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE--
- I KNOW WHO YOU ARE...

24:28.701 --> 24:31.003
AND WHO YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO BE.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.705
- NO PRETENSE, MR. DUFFY.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.974
I'M IN NEED OF RAILROAD WORKERS.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.009
WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK
PUT THE LAST TWO YEARS

24:37.109 --> 24:38.611
ON TO DURANT'S PAY BUT WAS ME?

24:38.711 --> 24:42.181
- I WAS HOPING
WE COULD MAINTAIN IT SIMILAR.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.249
- PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY
OF MEN, WERE YA?

24:43.349 --> 24:44.651
- FOR THE MOST PART.

24:44.751 --> 24:48.487
- [chuckles]
"FOR THE MOST PART."

24:48.588 --> 24:51.691
THEMS WERE THE CREME
DE LA CREME I SENT DURANT.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.260
NOT THE, UH, CONSUMPTIVE
OR THE WEAK-BACKED.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.796
I WINNOWED 'EM CLEAN.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.131
YOU KNOW WHY?

24:59.231 --> 25:00.533
MR. DURANT'S A FINE MAN.

25:00.633 --> 25:04.704
HE BACKS UP HIS WORD
WITH SOLID GOLD.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.205
LOCKED AWAY IN PRISON NOW.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.174
BECAUSE OF TATTERDUCKS.

25:08.274 --> 25:11.844
THEY'RE JEALOUS
OF HIS ACUMEN.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.145
THE MAN'S A GENIUS.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.747
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
MR. BOHANNON?

25:14.847 --> 25:17.149
- WELL...
RECKON EVEN A GENIUS

25:17.249 --> 25:20.587
CAN RUN AFOUL OF THE LAW,
MR. DUFFY.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.790
- $1,000 IN GOLD COINS

25:23.890 --> 25:26.826
FOR EACH LOT OF 500 MEN
BOARDED AT THE STATION.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.696
MCFEE COUNTS 'EM FOR ME.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.298
MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR NIGGER
THERE COUNT 'EM FOR YOU.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.966
THAT IS, OF COURSE,
IF HE CAN COUNT

25:34.066 --> 25:35.568
BEYOND HIS FINGERS AND TOES.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.203
THE ONES
THAT FALL OFF THE TRAIN

25:37.303 --> 25:39.806
OR THAT ARRIVE WITH RIGOR MORTIS
ARE NOT MY CONCERN.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.074
IT'S CALLED ATTRITION,
ACCORDING TO MR. DURANT.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.176
SOMETHING PRETTY
YOU WANNA SAY TO ME, BOY?

25:44.276 --> 25:47.546
- [chuckles]
THE DAY IT'S JUST ME AND YOU

25:47.647 --> 25:50.950
IS THE DAY
YOUR IRISH LUCK RUN OUT.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.218
- YOU GONNA LET YOUR NIGGER

25:52.318 --> 25:54.120
SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY,
MR. BOHANNON?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.855
- HE AIN'T MY NIGGER.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.156
SO WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE ABLE

25:57.256 --> 26:00.259
TO SEND OUT
THE FIRST SHIPMENT OF MEN?

26:00.359 --> 26:03.129
- LET US SEE YOUR GOLD.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.565
- I WOULDN'T SHOW YOU HOW MUCH
MONEY EVEN IF I HAD IT ON ME.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.571
- SO YOU COME AROUND HERE
WASTING MY TIME,

26:12.672 --> 26:16.876
NOT PLANNING
TO COMMENCE BUSINESS?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.145
MR. DURANT
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.981
HOW MUCH COIN
DO YOU HAVE ON YOU?

26:22.081 --> 26:25.251
- NOT ENOUGH TO TROUBLE YOU,
MR. DUFFY.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.923
- IT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL,
SIR.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.692
WHATEVER YOU HAVE ON YOU
WILL RECOMPENSE ME

26:32.792 --> 26:35.695
FOR SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.631
SEE, I'M A FINE JUDGE
OF CHARACTER, MR. BOHANNON,

26:38.731 --> 26:40.299
AND I CAN TELL
YOU HAVE NO INTEREST

26:40.399 --> 26:42.368
IN DEALING WITH ME
OR MY ENTERPRISE.

26:42.468 --> 26:44.603
- NOW THAT'S THE FIRST TRUTH
YOU SPOKE SINCE WE MET.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.039
[men chuckling]

26:47.139 --> 26:50.877
NOW ME AND MY FRIEND HERE,
WE'RE GONNA BACK OUT SLOW,

26:50.977 --> 26:53.680
AND THIS'LL BE DONE.

26:53.780 --> 26:54.681
[trigger cocks]

26:54.781 --> 26:57.316
[overlapping shouting]

26:58.384 --> 27:01.888
[gunshots]
- [screams]

27:09.696 --> 27:11.798
- BOY, DON'T YOU EVER STEP
OUT OF LINE LIKE THAT AGAIN.

27:11.898 --> 27:13.700
DON'T GO FOR MY GUN.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.267
LIKE TO GOT US KILLED.

27:15.367 --> 27:19.171
- WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE LET ME HAVE A GUN.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.973
- MY GRANDPAPPY
WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU PEOPLE.

27:21.073 --> 27:24.310
- YOU MEAN
WHEN HE OWNED US?

27:24.410 --> 27:26.045
- TORE A THOUSAND-ACRE
PLANTATION OUT OF NOTHING,

27:26.145 --> 27:27.113
HE DID.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.247
- WELL, YOU TELL
YOUR GRANDPAPPY

27:28.347 --> 27:29.782
WE A FREE PEOPLE NOW.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.350
YOU TELL HIM THAT.
- FREE?

27:31.450 --> 27:34.386
WELL, SHIT.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.255
DON'T YOU GO TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR FREEDOM, SON.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.290
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.160
I'M THE ONE
THAT PAID FULL PRICE FOR.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.931
YOU MAY BE FREE, BUT YOU SURE
AS SHIT AIN'T MY EQUAL.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.434
- TAKE 'EM OFF.

27:50.770 --> 27:54.406
TAKE 'EM OFF.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.976
- [grunts]

27:57.076 --> 27:59.245
OH, YEAH?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.313
ALL RIGHT.

28:01.413 --> 28:05.017
[both grunting]

28:12.959 --> 28:14.861
[knocks on door]

28:14.961 --> 28:18.097
SHH.
MIGHT BE THE LANDLADY.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.903
COME IN.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.977
MR. BEALE.

28:31.077 --> 28:33.012
- MR. BOHANNON.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.884
TELEGRAM.

28:37.984 --> 28:42.154
ACTUALLY,
IT'S FOR MR. FERGUSON.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.056
- THANK YOU, SIR.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.459
- YEAH, HE CAN READ.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.097
HE'S ALSO A FREE MAN,
IN CASE YOU HADN'T HEARD.

28:53.132 --> 28:56.102
- EVA HAD THE BABY.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.870
- YEAH.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.738
WHAT IS IT?

28:59.839 --> 29:03.209
- THERE YOU GO
TALKING THAT AGAIN.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.410
- I MEANT
IS IT A BOY OR GIRL?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.813
- DON'T SAY.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.882
BOY'S FINE.
GIRL'S SWEET TOO.

29:09.982 --> 29:13.252
JUST SAY IT'S HEALTHY.
- HEY.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.190
YOU REMEMBER THIS MINUTE,
ALL RIGHT?

29:20.993 --> 29:23.830
MIGHT ONLY COME ONCE.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.535
- YES, SIR.

29:29.635 --> 29:32.538
I GOT ME A BABY.
[chuckles]

30:06.906 --> 30:09.909
- I'M SORRY
FOR THE THINGS I'VE DONE.

30:12.511 --> 30:17.283
AND...FOR THE THINGS
I LEFT UNDONE.

30:24.323 --> 30:28.260
FEELING LIKE I BIT OFF
MORE THAN I CAN CHEW, YOU KNOW?

30:28.360 --> 30:31.030
[chuckles]

30:31.130 --> 30:33.332
COURSE YOU DO.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.071
- TAKE OFF YOUR GUN!

30:41.207 --> 30:44.576
WE'LL HAVE NO GUNS
IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD.

30:46.512 --> 30:50.182
THIS IS NOT
A SHOOTING GALLERY, SIR.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.118
- REVEREND CORNER.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.420
IT'S ME, CULLEN BOHANNON.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.555
YOU MARRIED ME
AND MARY ELIZABETH TATE HERE

30:56.655 --> 30:58.891
BACK IN '56.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.995
- UH...

31:06.065 --> 31:09.735
WE--WE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

31:13.605 --> 31:17.276
YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY
AND PRAY WITH US,

31:17.376 --> 31:20.046
BUT...

31:20.146 --> 31:23.082
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE
THE GUNS OUTSIDE.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.928
- GOOD DAY TO Y'ALL THEN.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.103
- I DID
WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.504
I VOTED AGAINST BOHANNON.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.040
- YOUR JOB WAS NOT
TO VOTE AGAINST BOHANNON.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.509
YOUR JOB WAS TO GET EVERYONE
ELSE TO VOTE AGAINST BOHANNON!

31:50.609 --> 31:52.078
- HE WAS VERY COMPELLING.

31:52.178 --> 31:55.982
- WELL, YOU TELL THAT
TO YOUR CONSTITUENTS

31:56.082 --> 31:59.051
WHEN THE UNION PACIFIC
BANKRUPTS YOUR STATE COFFERS.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.953
- YOU PROMISED
THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.689
- NO--

32:03.789 --> 32:05.424
[whispers]
NO.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.493
NOT WHEN I COULD RUN THINGS

32:07.593 --> 32:10.696
THROUGH THAT CLODDISH
SON-IN-LAW OF YOURS.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.564
[sighs]

32:17.236 --> 32:18.937
YOU HAVE GOT
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.974
- THOMAS, I DON'T THINK
I CAN GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

32:22.074 --> 32:25.044
WE FRANKLY HAVE RUN OUT
OF FRIENDLY JUDGES.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.578
- THERE'S ALWAYS
SOME NEW APPOINTEE,

32:26.678 --> 32:29.015
SOME--SOMEONE FRESHLY ELECTED,

32:29.115 --> 32:30.616
A HOLDER OF A LIEN,

32:30.716 --> 32:32.718
A WITNESS
WITH A FAULTY MEMORY.

32:32.818 --> 32:36.222
- PERHAPS A PEEPING TOM
OR A CHAMBERMAID WITH A TAIL.

32:36.322 --> 32:41.193
- NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU PISSANT!

32:41.293 --> 32:44.030
YOUR FALL
WILL BE FAR GREATER THAN MINE

32:44.130 --> 32:46.165
IF BOHANNON IS NOT STOPPED

32:46.265 --> 32:49.068
AND I AM
NOT RETURNED THE RAILROAD.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.205
- I UNDERSTAND.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.645
- GOOD.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.481
GOOD.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.384
[crowd chatter]

33:09.221 --> 33:11.157
- LOOKS A LOT LIKE
DURANT'S OLD CAR.

33:11.257 --> 33:14.393
- IT IS DURANT'S OLD CAR,
JUST REFURBISHED.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.129
BETTER SLEEPING QUARTERS,
HEATING THROUGHOUT.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.997
- CAN WE GET A COT IN HERE
OR SOMETHING FOR MR. FERGUSON

33:19.098 --> 33:20.666
FOR THE RIDE BACK TO OMAHA?

33:20.766 --> 33:24.370
- I LOANED MR. FERGUSON MONEY
FOR PASSAGE ON THE NEGRO CAR.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.378
MR. HUNTINGTON.

33:32.478 --> 33:35.247
- COLLIS HUNTINGTON,
HEAD OF CENTRAL PACIFIC.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.783
WHOA.

33:37.883 --> 33:41.253
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU, SIR.
BEEN WANTING TO MEET YOU.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.656
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HEARD
YOU WEREN'T DEAD.

33:44.756 --> 33:49.361
MR. BEALE, MAY I HAVE A MOMENT
WITH MR. BOHANNON, PLEASE?

33:49.461 --> 33:52.531
- THE PACKAGE ON THE DESK
CONTAINS YOUR ISSUED STOCK.

33:52.631 --> 33:56.468
- THANK YOU, MR. BEALE.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.480
YOU'RE BEING PAID IN STOCK

34:08.580 --> 34:09.781
BECAUSE THE UNION PACIFIC'S
LENDERS

34:09.881 --> 34:12.818
HAVE CLOSED THEIR BOOKS.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.756
- GOVERNMENT'S GUARANTEEING US.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.259
- GOVERNMENT'S IN CHAOS.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.361
SENATE WANTS TO IMPEACH THE
PRESIDENT FOR RECONSTRUCTION.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.130
THE HOUSE
IS INVESTIGATING HIM

34:24.230 --> 34:25.731
FOR THE ASSASSINATION
OF LINCOLN.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.266
THERE'LL BE NO NEW VOTE

34:27.366 --> 34:29.235
ON RAILROAD FUNDING
UNTIL NEXT SESSION.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.803
IN SHORT, MR. BOHANNON,
YOU AND YOUR RAILROAD ARE BROKE.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.805
- GOT STOCKPILES IN MISSOURI.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.741
I'LL BE IN WYOMING BY FALL.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.610
- NO, YOU WON'T, MR. BOHANNON,
REGARDLESS OF YOUR PACE.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.679
- I WAS MAKING 2 MILE A DAY.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.314
SOMETIMES 5
WHEN THE WORK WAS GOOD.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.183
- YOU KNOW
WHAT PROGRESS I'M MAKING?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.318
- HMM?
- 12 A DAY.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.453
- 12 MILES?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.755
- 12 INCHES A DAY.
[chuckles]

34:49.855 --> 34:51.757
THROUGH SOLID GRANITE.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.659
NOW THAT MAY
NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH,

34:53.759 --> 34:55.794
BUT I'M ALMOST
THROUGH THE SIERRAS.

34:55.894 --> 34:59.398
AND I JUST RECEIVED 5,000 POUNDS
OF NITROGLYCERIN

34:59.498 --> 35:02.134
AND 11,000 CHINAMEN
WHO DO NOT GET SICK

35:02.234 --> 35:04.436
AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK
WITH HALF PAY.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.638
NOW I AM BACKED
BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND,

35:06.738 --> 35:09.107
FUNDED BY ALL THE TONS
OF GLITTERING GOLD

35:09.208 --> 35:11.177
FOUND IN THE STREAMS
OF CALIFORNIA.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.345
IT'S THE GOLDEN STATE,
MR. BOHANNON.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.247
- LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU
THERE AT THE BORDER THEN.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.649
- OH, YOU HAVEN'T
READ THE PAPERS, SIR.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.385
MY FRIENDS IN CONGRESS
HAVE JUST VOTED

35:19.485 --> 35:21.520
TO LIFT
MY BUILDING RESTRICTIONS.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.323
NOW, ONCE I'M THROUGH THE
MOUNTAINS, IT'S ALL DOWNHILL.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.325
I INTEND TO CROSS
THE CALIFORNIA BORDER

35:26.425 --> 35:28.394
AND BE IN YOUR CAMP
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.496
- THE STRETCH BETWEEN NEBRASKA
AND CALIFORNIA IS MINE.

35:30.596 --> 35:35.434
- NO, SIR, IT BELONGS
TO WHOMEVER CAN CROSS IT FIRST.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.369
NOW, BASED ON YOUR REPUTATION,

35:37.469 --> 35:39.271
I'M OFFERING YOU A CHANCE
TO CROSS IT WITH ME,

35:39.371 --> 35:42.241
BUT FROM THE WEST,
AND YOU'LL BE PAID IN GOLD.

35:42.341 --> 35:46.645
NOT IN SOME WORTHLESS PAPER.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.615
- [chuckles]
HUH.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.886
WELL, I...
ALREADY GAVE MY WORD

35:54.986 --> 35:56.688
TO THE GENTLEMAN
AT CREDIT MOBILIER,

35:56.788 --> 35:59.525
AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL
I GOT LEFT, SO--

35:59.625 --> 36:02.494
[train rattles]

36:02.594 --> 36:04.530
- [grunts]

36:09.735 --> 36:10.769
- [in distance]
BOARD.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.571
ALL ABOARD.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.874
CHICAGO, OMAHA,

36:15.974 --> 36:18.844
AND ALL POINTS WEST.

36:18.944 --> 36:22.581
- IT WAS A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
MR. BOHANNON.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.616
[door opens]
- BOARD!

36:24.716 --> 36:26.585
[door closes]

36:26.685 --> 36:28.654
- HMM.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.971
- OMAHA!
THE STOP IS OMAHA.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.641
[background chatter]

36:54.413 --> 36:56.848
[baby fusses]

36:59.318 --> 37:01.320
[door opens]

37:08.494 --> 37:11.697
- WELL...
LOOK AT YOU.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.433
- HOW YOU FEELING?

37:14.533 --> 37:17.336
- SHE CAME OUT KICKING
AND TEARING.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.871
- SHE?
- MM-HMM.

37:22.941 --> 37:23.942
- CAN I SEE HER?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.977
- YEAH.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.784
- SHE'S MOVING ALL RIGHT.
- [chuckles]

37:32.884 --> 37:35.821
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.903
YOU CAN'T TELL MUCH
WITH NEWBORNS.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.973
THEY'RE ALL WRINKLED UP

37:55.073 --> 37:57.543
AND SPLOTCHY-LOOKING.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.713
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

38:06.485 --> 38:09.020
THANK YOU.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.895
SHE LIKE HER DADDY.
- [chuckles]

38:19.365 --> 38:21.567
I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.876
- LADIES.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.713
- AYE, MR. BOHANNON.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.748
YOU LOOK GREAT.
HOW WAS NEW YORK?

38:36.848 --> 38:39.084
- IT WAS AN OPEN SEWER,
MR. MCGINNES.

38:39.184 --> 38:40.852
MM.

38:40.952 --> 38:44.623
MY NEW HAT
DON'T FIT ME EITHER.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.525
- WELCOME BACK, SIR.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.060
WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED ABOUT,
UM, OUR NEW PROSPECTS WEST,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.061
AREN'T WE, GIRLS?
- YES.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.797
[all laugh]

38:51.897 --> 38:53.365
- IT'LL BE A FEW MORE DAYS
BEFORE WE SHIP OUT.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.700
WE NEED TO COLLECT
SOME CREWS.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.469
- ACTUALLY, UM...

38:57.569 --> 39:01.106
ONCE THE WORD GOT BACK THAT
YOU'RE THE NEW CHIEF ENGINEER,

39:01.206 --> 39:02.908
WORKERS STARTED
COMING IN FROM ALL OVER.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.911
BEGAN LOADING UP THE TRAINS.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.380
THAT'S A NICE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE, I WOULD SAY.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.617
WOULDN'T YOU, MR. BOHANNON?

39:11.717 --> 39:14.986
- WHEN DO WE ROLL OUT?

39:15.086 --> 39:18.457
- AT YOUR LEISURE AND SIGNAL.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.492
SIR.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.800
- YES, SIR.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.001
MR. BOHANNON.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.503
- [laughs]

39:31.603 --> 39:32.838
FREEDMEN READY TO GET TO WORK?

39:32.938 --> 39:35.641
- HMM, DAMN LOWLIFE
SCRABBLE HEREABOUTS

39:35.741 --> 39:38.043
TAKING ALL OUR HARD-SAVED
RAILROAD MONEY.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.645
- MM?
- MM-HMM.

39:39.745 --> 39:40.846
TREATING US LIKE
IT'S BACKSLIDING TIMES.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.448
- MM-MM.
- YES, SIR.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.815
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.884
EVEN HELL ON WHEELS?
- HMM.

39:45.984 --> 39:48.620
SOUND LIKE HEAVEN
WHEN YOU SAY IT.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.388
DON'T FORGET YOUR MAN
PSALMS HERE WHEN YOU MAKE

39:50.489 --> 39:51.857
YOUR, UH,
WALKING BOSS LIST, HUH?

39:51.957 --> 39:54.059
- THERE'S A LADY
ON THE COWCATCHER, MR. BOHANNON.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.561
- ALIVE OR DEAD?

39:55.661 --> 39:59.698
- I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.967
SAY, MR. BOHANNON,
IS THAT, UM--

40:02.067 --> 40:03.802
IS THAT SPARKY'S PIPE?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.837
- WAS.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.543
RUTH?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.983
- I'M SO SORRY,
MR. BOHANNON.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.152
I WAS GATHERING MY THOUGHTS
FOR A PRAYER BEFORE WE SET OFF.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.089
[bell ringing]

40:24.189 --> 40:27.659
[horn blows]

40:30.261 --> 40:33.064
YOU CAN PRAY WITH ME
IF YOU WANT.

40:33.164 --> 40:37.703
- I'LL LEAVE YOU IN CHARGE
OF THAT DEPARTMENT.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.148
- HEAVENLY FATHER,

40:50.248 --> 40:52.818
YOU HAVE GIVEN US A VISION
OF THIS RAILROAD

40:52.918 --> 40:55.654
WHICH WILL BIND OUR NATION.

40:55.754 --> 40:58.056
LORD CHRIST,
WHEN YOU CAME AMONG US,

40:58.156 --> 41:00.058
YOU PROCLAIMED
GOD'S KINGDOM

41:00.158 --> 41:03.895
IN TOWNS AND LONELY PLACES
SUCH AS THESE.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.899
GRANT THAT YOUR PRESENCE
BE KNOWN

41:07.999 --> 41:10.969
AS THIS RAILROAD
IS BUILT ACROSS THIS LAND.

41:15.206 --> 41:18.677
HAVE MERCY ON THOSE
WHO LABOR ON IT.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.047
SEND US
HONEST AND ABLE LEADERS.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.215
MAY PEACE PREVAIL
WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS,

41:24.315 --> 41:28.486
JUSTICE WITH ORDER,
AND HELP US ELIMINATE POVERTY,

41:28.587 --> 41:30.689
OPPRESSION ALONG THE WAY.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.725
AND ESPECIALLY
ELIMINATE EVIL.

41:43.769 --> 41:46.572
ALL THIS WE ASK

41:46.672 --> 41:48.707
IN GOD'S HOLY NAME.

41:50.008 --> 41:52.043
AMEN.
