01:47.234 --> 01:49.868
I AM TIRED OF GETTING HIT
IN THE SEAT FOR YOU.

01:49.868 --> 01:51.868
- LOOK, LOU, I RAN BAD
FOR A COUPLE OF GAMES.

01:51.868 --> 01:54.267

TRY NINE MONTHS.

01:54.267 --> 01:57.133
"JOSH SNOW, POKER GENIUS."
WHAT A JOKE.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.968

01:58.968 --> 02:00.234

WHAT YOU OWE ME, JOSH.

02:00.234 --> 02:02.000
- [scoffs] WHAT,
I'M SUPPOSED TO PULL 80K

02:02.000 --> 02:03.100
OUT OF MY EAR?

02:03.100 --> 02:04.634
- HONEY, HIS GAME'S
GONNA COME BACK.

02:04.634 --> 02:07.367
- I'M NOT WAITING ON THAT.

02:07.367 --> 02:09.000
YOU WORK IT OFF.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.199
COLLECTIONS.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.801
- NO, I TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T DO COLLECTIONS.

02:11.801 --> 02:14.734
- LIKE YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

02:14.734 --> 02:17.000
HIS FATHER WAS A LOSER.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.467
BAG MAN.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.133
IT'S IN THE BLOOD.

ANGELA'LL BRING YOU AROUND.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.367
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
HE GETS ENDS UP WITH ME.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.801

02:35.801 --> 02:38.133
BE THERE IN A LITTLE WHILE.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.334
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME AN HOUR.

02:39.334 --> 02:41.133
- YOU THINK THAT LAST CALL
WAS A CHARGE?

02:41.133 --> 02:42.667
- WHAT?
- THIS IS A CHARGE.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.868

TAKE A SHOWER.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.934
GO ON!

02:49.934 --> 02:53.334

CLEAN YOUR CLOCK.

02:53.334 --> 02:55.200
THOSE WERE ALL LOUSY CALLS.

02:58.868 --> 03:00.133
- THE VIG PLUS FIVE GRAND?

03:00.133 --> 03:01.734
THE GUY OWES ME 15K.

03:01.734 --> 03:03.133

03:03.133 --> 03:05.167

03:11.067 --> 03:13.033
WHEN YOU COLLECT,

04:03.234 --> 04:04.801
- BET AGAIN?

04:04.801 --> 04:07.033
YOUR HEART FOR 20K?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.400
- THE GUY PISSED HIMSELF.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.501
- [laughing]

04:15.501 --> 04:17.267
- YOU ARE INTENSE, JOSH.

04:17.267 --> 04:19.466
- I'LL TELL YOU,
LOU WAS RIGHT.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.300
BLANKS REALLY
PUT THE SCARE IN PEOPLE.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.634
- LOU SHOOTS NOTHING
BUT BLANKS.

04:24.634 --> 04:27.334
[both laugh]

04:29.367 --> 04:31.801
DOING THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY GOOD FOR YOU, JOSH.

04:40.701 --> 04:42.801
- OKAY, GIVE ME THE BLANKS.

05:07.734 --> 05:09.634
- OKAY, THAT'S KIP.

05:09.634 --> 05:11.968
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

05:20.133 --> 05:22.033
- HEY.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.434

05:23.434 --> 05:24.734
- YOU OWE LOU CARDINALE.

05:24.734 --> 05:26.334
- WHAT ARE YOU,
HIS MUSCLE?

05:36.534 --> 05:40.200
[tires screech]

05:40.200 --> 05:41.734

05:41.734 --> 05:42.834
COME ON, GET IN!

05:47.133 --> 05:48.634

[honking]

06:07.567 --> 06:08.934
[honks]

07:03.868 --> 07:04.868
- THEY PULL UP,

07:04.868 --> 07:06.501
HONK,
LEAVE A SHOOTING VICTIM.

07:06.501 --> 07:08.534
HAPPENS MORE TIMES
THAN YOU THINK.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.734
- CROWN VIC, DARK BLUE,
MAYBE BLACK.

07:10.734 --> 07:14.234
DRIVER'S MALE,
APPROXIMATELY SIX FEET.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.968
- YOU CAN SEE
THE LICENSE PLATE HERE.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.901
- YEAH, I CAN ENHANCE THAT.

07:17.901 --> 07:19.267
[beeping]

07:19.267 --> 07:20.334
THERE YOU GO.

07:20.334 --> 07:22.467
- "DQF-8093."

07:22.467 --> 07:24.300
- I'M ON IT.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.901
- SOON AS OUR PEOPLE GOT THERE,
HE TOOK OFF.

07:25.901 --> 07:27.534
- AND RULE OUT ROBBERY.

07:27.534 --> 07:30.067
STILL HAD ON AN EXPENSIVE
ROLEX WATCH

07:30.067 --> 07:31.934
AND A WALLET
FULL OF CASH.

07:31.934 --> 07:33.334
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?

07:33.334 --> 07:36.300
- HIS NAME IS KIP MCGONAGLE.
42, HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.300
HE DIED WITHIN AN HOUR
OF ARRIVING.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.501
NEVER REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.934
- ANY IDEA WHERE
THE SHOOTING OCCURRED?

07:40.934 --> 07:42.300
- WE'RE CHECKING 911 CALLS.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.234
NO GUNSHOTS REPORTED
IN THIS AREA.

07:44.234 --> 07:46.400
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.767
- THE OWNER OF THE CROWN VIC
HAS A DEFAULT WARRANT

07:48.767 --> 07:51.467
FOR MARIJUANA POSSESSION.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.534
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
KIP MCGONAGLE.

07:53.534 --> 07:56.133
- HE JUST WALKED UP
WITH A FATAL GUNSHOT WOUND

07:56.133 --> 07:58.133
AND ASKED FOR A RIDE?

07:58.133 --> 07:59.801
- I SAW HIM STAGGERING.

07:59.801 --> 08:01.534
KNEW HE WAS HURT BAD.

08:01.534 --> 08:03.634
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

08:03.634 --> 08:06.601
- WELL, HE BLED
ALL OVER THE SEATS.

08:06.601 --> 08:11.033
RIGHT? THE WHOLE CAR
WAS A BLOODY MESS.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.133
YET YOU TOOK HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.767
- YOU SAYING
I SHOULD HAVE LEFT HIM?

08:14.767 --> 08:16.534
- IT'S JUST HARD TO BELIEVE.

08:16.534 --> 08:19.067
- I WAS DRIVING HOME
FROM WORK.

08:19.067 --> 08:20.334
DUDE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.567
I COULDN'T JUST
LEAVE HIM IN THE STREET.

08:23.567 --> 08:26.100
- SO A GOOD SAMARITAN...

08:26.100 --> 08:28.033
PICKS UP
A FATALLY-WOUNDED GUY

08:28.033 --> 08:29.334
AND DUMPS HIM AT THE E.R.,

08:29.334 --> 08:31.300
AND THEN TAKES OFF.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.299
- IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,
DASHAWN.

08:33.299 --> 08:36.333
- LOOK, I GOT
A GOOD JOB, MAN.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.467
CLEANING OFFICES, YOU KNOW?

08:38.467 --> 08:40.400
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THAT OLD WARRANT.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.467
IF I WOULD HAVE STOPPED,

08:41.467 --> 08:42.701
THEY WOULD HAVE
FOUND OUT AT WORK.

08:42.701 --> 08:44.868
IT COULD MESS ME UP.

08:44.868 --> 08:46.367
I'M BEING STRAIGHT.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.868
CHECK MY TIME CARD.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.400
- SO WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.968
- CHINATOWN.

08:52.968 --> 08:54.634
MARKET STREET.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.467
- GUY'S DEAD.

08:57.467 --> 08:58.534
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

08:58.534 --> 09:00.434
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

09:00.434 --> 09:02.167
I MEAN, YOU GAVE US
THE GUN...THE SHELLS!

09:02.167 --> 09:04.167
- YOU ARE NOT PUTTING THIS
ON ME.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.634
- LOU, IT WAS
SOME WEIRD ACCIDENT.

09:06.634 --> 09:08.667
- ADMIT IT.
HE WAS SHOWING OFF.

09:08.667 --> 09:09.901
FOR YOU.

09:09.901 --> 09:10.901
LOOKING TO GET
HIS ROPE GREASED.

09:10.901 --> 09:12.601
- [scoffs]
- DON'T BE A PIG.

09:12.601 --> 09:14.434
- YOU WAIT IN THE BACK.

09:19.801 --> 09:22.367
- LOOK, YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE ME, LOU--

09:22.367 --> 09:24.434
- TALK ABOUT GRIEF.

09:24.434 --> 09:26.567
IT IS AROUND
THAT KIP OWED ME 11 GRAND.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.868
HE'S DEAD.
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

09:29.868 --> 09:32.868
YOU LEAVE, AND I DO NOT
WANT YOU NEAR THIS PLACE.

09:32.868 --> 09:33.868
YOU GOT IT?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.033
NOW GIVE ME THE GUN
AND THE BLANKS.

09:38.033 --> 09:41.100
- GIVE YOU THE GUN
I SHOT SOMEONE WITH?

09:41.100 --> 09:43.434
SUCKER'S NOT
IN MY JOB DESCRIPTION, PAL!

09:43.434 --> 09:45.000
- HEY, YOU DO NOT
TALK TO ME THAT WAY!

09:49.968 --> 09:52.934
- SO MCGONAGLE'S HIT,
AND HE GOES DOWN.

09:52.934 --> 09:56.267
- THE BLOOD TRAIL
GOES PAST THE GUTTER.

09:56.267 --> 09:59.801
- STEPS OUT INTO THE STREET.

09:59.801 --> 10:03.634
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY DOES HE GO THIS WAY?

10:03.634 --> 10:04.801
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

10:04.801 --> 10:06.467
YOU KNOW, WHY NOT HEAD
TOWARDS CHINATOWN?

10:06.467 --> 10:07.567
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.868
PEDESTRIANS.

10:08.868 --> 10:11.567
- MAYBE HE THOUGHT
HELP WAS OVER THERE?

10:11.567 --> 10:13.234
LET'S GET A FULL CANVAS
OF THOSE BUILDINGS.

10:21.167 --> 10:23.100
- HMM.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.767
THINK MAYBE WE CAUGHT
A REAL BREAK.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.100
- WHY?

10:26.100 --> 10:28.801
- GOREN AND EAMES.
I KNOW THOSE COPS.

10:28.801 --> 10:29.968
- KNOW THEM HOW?

10:29.968 --> 10:34.434
- THEY PUT AWAY THE GUY
THAT KILLED MY FATHER.

10:34.434 --> 10:38.100
- KIP MCGONAGLE DESCRIBED
HIMSELF ON THE LEASE FORM

10:38.100 --> 10:39.901
AS A SINGLE MAN.

10:39.901 --> 10:41.834
GUESS WE KNOW
WHAT THIS PLACE WAS FOR.

10:42.901 --> 10:45.200
[door squeaks]

10:47.334 --> 10:49.400
- PORN AND SPORTS.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.667
- THE ELEMENTS
OF KIP'S SECRET LIFE.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.367
BETTING SLIPS?

10:56.367 --> 10:58.033
HE WAS KEEPING TRACK
OF A LOT OF ACTION.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.834
I'D SAY MORE THAN
JUST HIS OWN.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.767
- THIS LOOKS LIKE
FLASH PAPER.

11:04.767 --> 11:05.801
YEP.

11:05.801 --> 11:07.400
SO IN CASE THERE'S A RAID,

11:07.400 --> 11:08.667
THEY CAN
GET RID OF IT QUICK.

11:08.667 --> 11:12.033
YOU KNOW, FLASH PAPER
AND ALL THAT ACTION.

11:12.033 --> 11:14.968
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE CHANGE
IN HIS BETTING PATTERNS.

11:14.968 --> 11:16.334
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE MOVED UP THE SCALE

11:16.334 --> 11:18.801
TO A MINI BOOK OPERATION.

11:18.801 --> 11:20.901
- AND BECAME SOMEONE'S
COMPETITION.

11:20.901 --> 11:23.601
- I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.167
- YOUR HUSBAND TAUGHT
HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE?

11:26.167 --> 11:28.534
- THAT'S RIGHT.
11 YEARS.

11:28.534 --> 11:30.100
- I DON'T MEAN TO BE BLUNT,

11:30.100 --> 11:32.801
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE TEACHERS

11:32.801 --> 11:35.033
ARE FINALLY GETTING PAID
WHAT THEY'RE WORTH.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.334
YOUR HOUSE IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
I MEAN, THERE'S LOTS OF--

11:37.334 --> 11:38.934
- HE DID
A LOT OF MOONLIGHTING.

11:38.934 --> 11:41.901
HE TUTORED KIDS.
HE REFFED COLLEGE BASKETBALL.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.300
HE WAS REFFING YESTERDAY.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.067
- OH, YEAH?
UH, WHERE?

11:45.067 --> 11:46.601
- CITY COLLEGE.
HOME GAME.

11:46.601 --> 11:48.501
- AND AFTER THAT?

11:48.501 --> 11:52.167
- I DON'T KNOW.
I--I WAS AWAY.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.334
- IT WASN'T STRANGE

11:53.334 --> 11:55.434
THAT HE DIDN'T COME HOME
AFTER THE GAME?

11:55.434 --> 11:57.200
- WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.033
- WHAT DID HE USUALLY DO
AFTER REFFING?

12:02.033 --> 12:05.067
- THERE...WAS A SPORTS BAR
WHERE HE'D UNWIND.

12:05.067 --> 12:07.701
UM...PLAYERS OR PLAY--
I DON'T KNOW.

12:07.701 --> 12:10.701
SPORTS WASN'T SOMETHING
WE SHARED.

12:10.701 --> 12:13.033
- WELL, MAYBE WE CAN FIND IT
IN THE RECEIPTS.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.200
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE
HIS FINANCIAL RECORDS,

12:15.200 --> 12:16.801
PHONE BILLS,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

12:16.801 --> 12:20.901
- KEEPING RECORDS
WASN'T HIS STRONG SUIT.

12:20.901 --> 12:24.701
- THIS IS ONE OF KIP MCGONAGLE'S
LAST GAMES AS A REF.

12:24.701 --> 12:28.467
WE WANTED TO SEE IF HE MADE
ANY OBVIOUS ENEMIES.

12:28.467 --> 12:32.234
- ONE OF OUR COUNCILMEN
CALLED HIM A MODEL CITIZEN

12:32.234 --> 12:34.234
WHO GAVE HIS TIME
TO OUTREACH PROGRAMS.

12:34.234 --> 12:36.234
NOT EXACTLY A MODEL REF.

12:36.234 --> 12:38.100
WE'RE SEEING
SOME QUESTIONABLE CALLS HERE.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.334
- ISN'T THAT
WHY EVERYONE HATES REFS?

12:40.334 --> 12:41.701
- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

12:41.701 --> 12:44.200
HE'S CALLING REPEATED FOULS
ON THE SAME PLAYERS.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.234
THAT'S SEVEN
FOR THE HOME TEAM,

12:47.234 --> 12:49.033
NONE FOR THE VISITORS.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.701
- IT'S MORE THAN JUST
BAD REFFING.

12:50.701 --> 12:54.367
KIP MCGONAGLE
HAD SOME KIND OF AGENDA.

12:59.901 --> 13:01.334
- WHAT?

13:01.334 --> 13:03.400
- YOU'VE TAKEN UP ACCOUNTING?

13:03.400 --> 13:06.367
- IT'S THE FINAL SCORES
FROM KIP'S GAMES

13:06.367 --> 13:07.501
FROM THE PAST TWO SEASONS.

13:07.501 --> 13:09.868
THIS IS THE POINT SPREAD
OF KIP'S GAMES.

13:09.868 --> 13:13.634
I COMPARED IT TO THE VEGAS
SPREAD FROM THE SAME GAMES.

13:13.634 --> 13:16.634
- THE GAMES HE REFFED
USUALLY BEAT THE VEGAS SPREAD

13:16.634 --> 13:17.634
BY A COUPLE OF POINTS.

13:17.634 --> 13:18.634
- 85% OF THE TIME.

13:18.634 --> 13:21.300
YOU KNOW THE CHANCES OF THAT?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.400
- KIP WAS SHAVING POINTS.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.133
THAT COULD HAVE PAID
FOR HIS LIFESTYLE.

13:25.133 --> 13:28.934
- YEAH, THEN HE STOPS
BEATING THE SPREAD MID-SEASON.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.834
PROBABLY HIS LOCAL BOOKIE
GOT WISE AND,

13:30.834 --> 13:33.634
YOU KNOW,
WOULDN'T TAKE HIS BETS.

13:33.634 --> 13:36.767
- BUT WE SAW HIM MAKE BAD CALLS
THE DAY OF HIS DEATH.

13:36.767 --> 13:40.200
- HE FOUND
ANOTHER WAY OF BETTING.

13:41.801 --> 13:43.534
- WELL, I CAN'T
IMAGINE HIS OLD BOOKIE

13:43.534 --> 13:45.767
WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT.

13:45.767 --> 13:47.267
- FAMILIAR TO MANY
THROUGH HIS WORK

13:47.267 --> 13:48.834
WITH UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS,

13:48.834 --> 13:51.033
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE
HAS PRAISED HIS DISPLAYS OF--

13:55.734 --> 13:57.501
- IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.701
THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IS SAYING
HE'S SOME KIND OF DO-GOODER,

14:02.701 --> 14:03.934
AND THE COPS
WILL STOP AT NOTHING

14:03.934 --> 14:06.033
TO GET HIS KILLER.

14:06.033 --> 14:07.300
[chamber snaps shut]

14:07.300 --> 14:08.701
- LIKE I DON'T FEEL BAD ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

14:13.801 --> 14:16.033
SINGED ENDS.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.734
NO LEAD.

14:17.734 --> 14:21.734
THERE'S NO WAY THIS COULD
HAVE KILLED SOMEBODY.

14:21.734 --> 14:23.868
UNLESS...

14:23.868 --> 14:26.133
- LOU RIGGED IT?

14:29.467 --> 14:31.234
- I THINK WE'RE GETTING FRAMED,
ANGELA.

14:31.234 --> 14:32.567
- "WE"?

14:32.567 --> 14:33.601
- WELL, IF I GO DOWN,

14:33.601 --> 14:34.701
THE COPS GOT YOU ON
A FELONY MURDER

14:34.701 --> 14:36.801
JUST FOR DRIVING THE CAR.

14:43.434 --> 14:46.234
- WE GOT TO GET OUT
IN FRONT OF THIS, JOSH.

14:46.234 --> 14:48.067
- WITHOUT LOU FINDING OUT,
YOU MEAN.

14:48.067 --> 14:49.434
- YEAH.

14:51.234 --> 14:53.968
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.300
- SO THIS PAD--

15:15.300 --> 15:17.868
ANY WITNESSES SEE
WHO COMES AND GOES?

15:17.868 --> 15:20.000
- WELL, HE CHOSE WELL.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.067
FOUR FLOORS,
SIX APARTMENTS.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.968
NOBODY SEES ANYTHING.

15:23.968 --> 15:25.567
- WHAT ABOUT HIS FINANCES?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.934
- SHOULD HAVE STUCK
WITH THE GAMES THAT HE FIXED.

15:27.934 --> 15:31.100
'CAUSE WHAT HE WON ON THOSE,
HE BET ON OTHER SPORTS.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.434
- HIS ACCOUNTS
ARE MAXED OUT.

15:32.434 --> 15:34.400
HE MADE WEEKLY
ATM WITHDRAWALS

15:34.400 --> 15:36.467
FROM A CASH MACHINE
DOWN THE STREET

15:36.467 --> 15:38.934
FROM A SPORTS BAR
HE FREQUENTED.

15:38.934 --> 15:39.934
- PHONE RECORDS?

15:39.934 --> 15:41.567
- NUMEROUS CALLS
TO THE BAR.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.334
THEY STOPPED
A FEW MONTHS BACK.

15:43.334 --> 15:45.734
THE BAR IS OWNED
BY LOU CARDINALE.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.667
- NOT JUST ANY OLD BOOKIE.

15:47.667 --> 15:51.234
OWING LOU WOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE ITS RISKS.

15:52.434 --> 15:55.400
- YEAH, HON, I FOUND
THAT CAR YOU WANT.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.434
A DEMO.

15:58.434 --> 16:00.801
I'LL HAVE SOMEONE
BRING YOU TO SEE IT.

16:00.801 --> 16:03.167
OKAY, GOTTA GO.

16:03.167 --> 16:06.300
SWEETS...RUN MY WIFE
OVER TO SEE THAT CAR.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.400
- SURE.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.734
- SO, DETECTIVES...

16:12.734 --> 16:16.901
- WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR REGULARS.

16:16.901 --> 16:18.100
KIP MCGONAGLE.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.934
- TERRIBLE
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

16:19.934 --> 16:22.234
WE'RE ALL SICK ABOUT IT.

16:22.234 --> 16:25.167
- ARE THOSE
REAL HAWKEN'S RIFLES?

16:25.167 --> 16:27.100
- AUTHENTIC.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.868
ANY ONE OF THEM COULD HAVE
BELONGED TO DANIEL BOONE.

16:29.868 --> 16:33.100
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW MR. MCGONAGLE?

16:33.100 --> 16:34.267
- KIP?

16:34.267 --> 16:35.701
HE HASN'T BEEN AROUND HERE
IN A WHILE.

16:35.701 --> 16:37.767
BUT MY BARTENDER
WOULD KNOW FOR SURE.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.100
NAME'S LON FIORE.
I'LL GET YOU THE NUMBER.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.634
- YOU REALLY SEEM
TO HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.968
SO WHAT KIND OF ACTION
WERE YOU TAKING FOR KIP?

16:45.968 --> 16:47.801
- WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT?

16:47.801 --> 16:50.267
- KIP GAMBLED,
THIS IS A SPORTS BAR,

16:50.267 --> 16:52.801
AND YOU'VE HAD NUMEROUS
INDICTMENTS FOR BOOKMAKING.

16:52.801 --> 16:53.868
- HOW MANY CONVICTIONS?

16:53.868 --> 16:55.534
- HOW MANY ASSAULT CHARGES?

16:55.534 --> 16:56.701
- ALL DISMISSED.

16:56.701 --> 16:58.667
DO I HAVE TO CALL MY LAWYER
AND GET BILLED,

16:58.667 --> 16:59.868
OR CAN WE KEEP THIS CIVIL?

16:59.868 --> 17:01.334
PEOPLE COME IN HERE.

17:01.334 --> 17:02.634
THEY MAY BET
AMONG THEMSELVES,

17:02.634 --> 17:05.334
BUT I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS
NOT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.

17:05.334 --> 17:06.666
- HEY, THAT'S JOSH SNOW.

17:06.666 --> 17:07.701
[pool balls clack]

17:07.701 --> 17:09.334
JOSH SNOW, ISN'T IT?

17:09.334 --> 17:10.467
HE COMES IN HERE?

17:10.467 --> 17:12.133
- YEAH.

17:12.133 --> 17:14.367
YOU FOLLOW TOURNAMENT POKER?

17:14.367 --> 17:15.901
- I DO, I DO.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.000
I LIKE THE SUSPENSE,
YOU KNOW.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.501
THE TELLS, YOU KNOW,
THE BLUFFING AND...HEH.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.666
- THAT'S THE BEST PART
OF ANY GAME.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.300
- HE'S SMOOTH.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.634
- YOU KNOW, JURIES,

17:29.634 --> 17:32.434
THEY USUALLY SEE BOOKMAKING
AS A VICTIMLESS CRIME.

17:32.434 --> 17:35.100
- WELL, IT WASN'T VICTIMLESS
FOR JOSH SNOW'S FATHER.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.767
MURDERED
OVER A GAMBLING DEBT.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.267
NOW JOSH
IS IN THE SAME WORLD.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.868
- I'VE SEEN HIS NAME...
A FEW TIMES.

17:42.868 --> 17:47.467
HE PLACED HIGH IN, UH,
TOP POKER TOURNAMENTS.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.167
THEN HE FELL OFF THE MAP.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.534
- YOU CAN BET HE'S STILL
CLOSE TO SOME GAME.

17:51.534 --> 17:53.133
THEY NEVER LOSE THE ITCH.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.100
- OMAHA, HIGH-LOW.

18:03.467 --> 18:04.968
- BAIL OUT.

18:04.968 --> 18:07.834
- I WANT TO SEE THE FLOP.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.667
- RAISE YOU.

18:09.667 --> 18:10.701
- GARBAGE.

18:16.167 --> 18:17.534
- GAME'S BORING YOU?

18:19.400 --> 18:20.767
- A LITTLE.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.801
[chips clink]

18:21.801 --> 18:22.868
- JOSH SNOW.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.501
- WHAT?

18:25.501 --> 18:28.234
- WELL, I WAS JUST SAYING
THERE'S NO JOSH SNOW HERE.

18:28.234 --> 18:29.534
YOU KNOW?

18:29.534 --> 18:30.501
- WHAT ARE YOU, A GROUPIE?

18:34.067 --> 18:35.100
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?

18:35.100 --> 18:37.701
- JOSH SNOW.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.033
WHO THE HELL
IS JOSH SNOW?

18:41.334 --> 18:42.434
WHO'S UP?

18:42.434 --> 18:43.534
WHERE ARE WE AT?

18:48.934 --> 18:51.868
- THAT'S CLEVER.

18:51.868 --> 18:54.033
- WHAT?

18:54.033 --> 18:55.067
- WELL, LET ME GUESS.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.267
UH, SOME
OVER-THE-COUNTER SPEED.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.667
MAYBE A COCKTAIL
OF COCAINE AND CAFFEINE.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.200
YOU KNOW, KEEP YOU
DRENCHED IN SWEAT

19:01.200 --> 19:03.601
SO THAT YOU'RE
HARD TO READ.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.334
EXCEPT THIS DEODORANT HERE,

19:05.334 --> 19:09.234
IT'S NOT GONNA COVER UP
THIS CHEMICAL SMELL, YOU KNOW?

19:09.234 --> 19:10.934
- AND I SHOULD CARE
WHAT YOU THINK?

19:14.868 --> 19:16.534
[tapping]

19:17.701 --> 19:19.000
OH, JEEZ.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.067
- HUH, I WONDER
WHAT'S IN HERE.

19:29.067 --> 19:32.734
SO...JOSH SNOW.

19:32.734 --> 19:36.133
PLAYED HIM
AND YOU BEAT HIM?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.300
I MEAN, FOR SOME REASON
YOU FELT THE NEED TO BRAG

19:38.300 --> 19:39.300
WHEN HIS NAME CAME UP.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.334
I WAS WONDERING.

19:41.334 --> 19:44.734
- [scoffs] AND I DIDN'T
READ YOU FOR MUCH OF A PLAYER.

19:44.734 --> 19:47.734
YEAH...I BEAT JOSH.

19:47.734 --> 19:50.734
BUT YOU MIGHT SAY
I TOOK ADVANTAGE.

19:50.734 --> 19:52.601
THAT THING WITH HIS WIFE
MADE HIM RUN BAD.

19:52.601 --> 19:55.300
- PENELOPE?
- I DON'T KNOW HER NAME.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.167
BUT SHE DIED OF CANCER,
AND IT KILLED HIS GAME.

19:58.167 --> 20:00.467
HE'S HAVING TO DO COLLECTIONS
FOR LOU CARDINALE.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.167
[chuckles]

20:02.167 --> 20:03.667
ARE YOU ACTUALLY
TAKING ME IN?

20:06.334 --> 20:07.601
[pills rattling]

20:09.400 --> 20:13.067
- JOSH IS A BIT SMALL
FOR COLLECTIONS.

20:13.067 --> 20:14.400
- YOU KNOW FRANKIE MARTIN?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.234
- I DON'T KNOW,
REMIND ME,

20:16.234 --> 20:18.501
WHILE I'M FORGETTING
ABOUT ARRESTING YOU.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.434
- HE'S A DEGENERATE
WHO BETS COLLEGE GAMES.

20:22.434 --> 20:25.567
LOST A LOT OF MONEY TO LOU
A FEW MONTHS BACK.

20:25.567 --> 20:29.434
SAID JOSH LOOKED REAL BIG...
WITH A .38 IN HIS HAND.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.901
- JOSH SNOW, YEAH.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.067
SO WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

20:36.067 --> 20:38.400
- HE COLLECTED SOME MONEY
FROM YOU?

20:38.400 --> 20:39.701
- YEAH, HE CAME,
AND I PAID.

20:39.701 --> 20:40.834
WHAT'S THE CRIME?

20:40.834 --> 20:42.200
- IT WAS THAT EASY?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.067
YOU'RE, LIKE,
TWICE THE GUY'S SIZE.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.901
- HE WAS PERSUASIVE.

20:45.901 --> 20:47.534
AND I WAS AFRAID
THAT LOU HAD FOUND OUT

20:47.534 --> 20:48.767
THAT I HAD SHIFTED.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.868
- YOU MEAN YOU WERE
BETTING WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

20:50.868 --> 20:53.567
- I GAVE KIP MCGONAGLE
SOME ACTION.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.534
AND I THOUGHT, IF THIS IS
WHAT THIS IS REALLY IS ABOUT,

20:55.534 --> 20:56.868
I COULD BE DEAD.

20:56.868 --> 20:58.701
- SO JOSH THREATENED YOU
WITH A GUN.

20:58.701 --> 21:01.601
- HE SHOT AT ME...
AND MISSED.

21:01.601 --> 21:03.767
OR I'D BE PLAYING
DRAG ACTS.

21:03.767 --> 21:06.734
AN ESCALADE WAS OVER THERE,
AND HE JUMPED IN.

21:06.734 --> 21:08.300
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.
- WELL, HANG ON A SECOND.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.701
- ESCALADE.
DID YOU SEE THE DRIVER?

21:10.701 --> 21:12.033
- NO.

21:16.701 --> 21:18.868
- [laughing]
BABE. BABE.

21:18.868 --> 21:20.133
ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
I'M TRY--

21:20.133 --> 21:22.267
I'M TRYING TO DRIVE.

21:22.267 --> 21:23.968
HEY.

21:23.968 --> 21:25.300
- I'M KEEPING IT.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.300
- GIVE ME THE HAT BACK.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.734
- NO.

21:27.734 --> 21:29.434
- GIVE ME THE HAT.
- [giggles]

21:29.434 --> 21:30.801
- GIVE ME THIS, I WILL--
- [laughing]

21:30.801 --> 21:33.634
I WILL BUY--I'LL BUY YOU
ANOTHER ONE.

21:33.634 --> 21:35.400
- I KNOW.
IT'S FOR HER SON.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.501
- TOMMY.

21:38.334 --> 21:40.667
- HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOUR WIFE PASSED?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.234
- YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HER.

21:44.968 --> 21:47.100
- I HAD AN AUNT DIE OF CANCER.
IT WAS REALLY--

21:47.100 --> 21:48.234
- I SAID DROP IT, OKAY?

21:50.968 --> 21:53.200
DAMN.

21:55.801 --> 21:57.601
YOU BETTER TAKE THE CAR.

21:57.601 --> 22:01.200
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING HERE,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE A PART OF IT.

22:06.601 --> 22:07.534
HUH.

22:08.934 --> 22:12.334
DIDN'T GET THE CARD
ABOUT OUR REUNION.

22:12.334 --> 22:14.767
- JOSH.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.868
YOU REMEMBER
DETECTIVE EAMES.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.200
- YEAH.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.000
SO WE PARTED ON GOOD TERMS.
WE GOT A PROBLEM NOW?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.934
- THIS WARRANT...

22:22.934 --> 22:24.501
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE .38
YOU USED

22:24.501 --> 22:26.534
TO KILL KIP MCGONAGLE.

22:26.534 --> 22:30.267
- IT WOULD HELP
IF I KNEW WHO THAT WAS.

22:30.267 --> 22:33.300
- WELL, HE OWES
LOU CARDINALE MONEY,

22:33.300 --> 22:37.033
THE MAN THAT YOU WERE
MAKING COLLECTIONS FOR.

22:37.033 --> 22:39.067
- LOOK...

22:39.067 --> 22:41.200
I PLAY TOURNAMENT POKER.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.167
LOU BACKED ME
IN A COUPLE GAMES.

22:43.167 --> 22:44.334
END OF STORY.

22:44.334 --> 22:46.567
- YOU WERE I.D.'d
BY SOMEONE YOU SHOT AT.

22:46.567 --> 22:48.434
- REALLY?

22:48.434 --> 22:49.868
I'M THINKING IF YOU GUYS
HAD SOMEONE

22:49.868 --> 22:50.968
WILLING TO PICK ME
OUT OF A LINEUP,

22:50.968 --> 22:52.133
I'D BE IN HANDCUFFS
RIGHT NOW.

22:54.067 --> 22:56.234
THAT'S THE TELL,
SO I CAN RELAX.

22:56.234 --> 22:57.467
- HANDICAPPING?

22:57.467 --> 22:59.033
- YOU WANT A TIP?

22:59.033 --> 23:00.367
- WELL, IT'S JUST THAT,

23:00.367 --> 23:04.601
BACK WHEN WE INVESTIGATED
YOUR FATHER'S DEATH...

23:04.601 --> 23:07.200
WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID?
NO GAMES OF CHANCE?

23:08.667 --> 23:10.234
- THE NUMBERS
ARE A RECREATION.

23:10.234 --> 23:12.067
I ALWAYS GOT "A"s IN MATH.

23:12.067 --> 23:15.334
- BLANKS FOR A .38.

23:15.334 --> 23:17.334
WE'RE GETTING WARM.

23:17.334 --> 23:19.167
WHAT WOULD YOU
USE THESE FOR?

23:19.167 --> 23:20.133
- FOURTH OF JULY.

23:22.133 --> 23:25.200
CAN YOU GUYS MAKE
A WEAPONS CHARGE ON BLANKS?

23:25.200 --> 23:27.133
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

23:29.634 --> 23:31.968
- I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

23:35.801 --> 23:39.667
- WHAT ARE YOU HOPING
TO FIND HERE, GOREN?

23:39.667 --> 23:43.033
10 OF HEARTS?

23:43.033 --> 23:44.400
JACK OF SPADES?

23:47.801 --> 23:49.234
I DIDN'T KILL THAT GUY.

23:49.234 --> 23:51.701
- NOW, DON'T PLAY ME, JOSH.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.734
- [sighs] WHAT HAPPENED?

24:24.734 --> 24:26.100
- THEY GOT NOTHING.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.067
I MIGHT NEED YOU
AS A WITNESS, THOUGH.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.300
- WHAT WOULD I SAY?

24:29.300 --> 24:32.300
- YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO KILL THE GUY.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.000
THEY WERE BLANKS.
YOU SAW ME LOAD THEM.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.767
- YOU AIMED AT THE GUY,
JOSH.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.434
I MEAN, IT'S GOT TO BE
SOME KIND OF CRIME.

24:38.434 --> 24:40.133
- MAYBE RECKLESS
ENDANGERMENT.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.267
LOOK, WE PLAY THIS RIGHT,
YOU GET IMMUNITY,

24:42.267 --> 24:45.634
I PLEAD OUT
FOR LESS THAN A DEUCE.

24:45.634 --> 24:48.133
- THEY CONNECT IT TO LOU,
CHARGE HIM WITH MURDER?

24:48.133 --> 24:51.734
- WELL, LOU RIGGED IT.
THAT'S WHERE MY MIND GOES.

24:51.734 --> 24:54.467
- MY MIND GOES TO HIM
KILLING US.

24:54.467 --> 24:57.167
- NOT IF HE'S JAMMED UP.

24:57.167 --> 24:58.300
ARE YOU STILL HOPING

24:58.300 --> 25:00.467
MAYBE HE'S GONNA
LEAVE HIS WIFE AND...

25:00.467 --> 25:01.734
- [scoffs]

25:01.734 --> 25:03.234
NO.

25:03.234 --> 25:05.000
I'M HOPING HE'LL GO DOWN.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.467
- HE WILL.

25:07.467 --> 25:10.167
IT'S A GAME, ANGELA.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.834
I'M HOLDING A SOLID HAND.

25:12.834 --> 25:18.033
I'M GONNA TALK TO THE D.A.

25:18.033 --> 25:19.467
- WE'VE EMPANELLED
THE GRAND JURY.

25:19.467 --> 25:21.300
- WITHOUT A SUSPECT?

25:21.300 --> 25:24.300
- JOSH SNOW.

25:24.300 --> 25:25.901
- NO MURDER WEAPON?

25:25.901 --> 25:27.968
NO HARD EVIDENCE?

25:27.968 --> 25:29.901
- FRANKIE MARTIN WILL TESTIFY
HE WAS SHOT AT.

25:29.901 --> 25:31.267
YOU FOUND WITNESSES

25:31.267 --> 25:32.934
THAT JOSH COLLECTED
FOR LOU CARDINALE.

25:32.934 --> 25:35.267
- WHO'LL HIDE BEHIND
TEN DEFENSE LAWYERS

25:35.267 --> 25:36.601
THE MINUTE YOU INDICT.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.467
- ISN'T LOU THE PRIZE
IN ALL THIS?

25:38.467 --> 25:40.267
- WE'RE THINKING INDICT JOSH,

25:40.267 --> 25:41.501
HE DELIVERS LOU.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.801
- SO, UH, JOSH
HAS SPOKEN TO YOU?

25:47.801 --> 25:51.334
- ANY CONVERSATIONS LIKE THAT
WOULD BE OFF THE RECORD.

25:51.334 --> 25:53.033
I HAVE A MEETING.

25:54.534 --> 25:56.033
- SO THEY WANT LOU.

25:56.033 --> 25:57.434
SOUNDS LIKE
THEY'RE GONNA GET HIM.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.200
- IF KIP OWED
LOU CARDINALE MONEY,

26:01.200 --> 26:03.067
WHY WOULD LOU
WANT HIM KILLED?

26:03.067 --> 26:07.133
- UNLESS IT WASN'T
ABOUT THE DEBT.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.701
[mechanical humming]

26:08.701 --> 26:10.434
[beep]

26:10.434 --> 26:12.801
- MEDICAL HISTORY
FOR JOSH'S WIFE.

26:12.801 --> 26:14.767
SHE DIED OF MULTIPLE
BRAIN TUMORS.

26:14.767 --> 26:17.767
- AND HOW LONG WAS SHE SICK?

26:17.767 --> 26:21.934
- LESS THAN A YEAR
BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS AND DEATH.

26:21.934 --> 26:24.300
THE SUDDEN
LOSS OF A SPOUSE,

26:24.300 --> 26:26.200
YOU'RE IN A DAZE, NUMB.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.534
YOU QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT.

26:28.534 --> 26:31.400
YOU'RE ANGRY ABOUT THINGS
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE

26:31.400 --> 26:34.067
THAT MIGHT HAVE
CHANGED THINGS.

26:34.067 --> 26:37.300
- AND IN POKER, NOTHING WILL
KILL YOUR GAME LIKE ANGER.

26:39.601 --> 26:41.167
- COME ON, TOMMY,
LET'S SEE SOME HUSTLE!

26:51.567 --> 26:54.701
- HE'S NINE NOW?

26:54.701 --> 26:55.634
- TEN.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.601
- HOW'S HE DOING?

26:59.601 --> 27:00.968
- HE'S OKAY.

27:00.968 --> 27:03.601
HE'S BEEN THROUGH IT.

27:03.601 --> 27:05.367
- ROUGH FOR YOU TOO, RIGHT?

27:05.367 --> 27:07.601
- HMM.

27:07.601 --> 27:09.601
THIS IS WHERE YOU TELL ME...

27:09.601 --> 27:11.234
IT'LL FEEL BETTER
IF I TALK ABOUT IT

27:11.234 --> 27:13.300
AND I CONFESS TO SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO, RIGHT?

27:13.300 --> 27:15.434
- YOU'RE TALKING TO THE D.A.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.167
- DID THAT HURT
YOUR FEELINGS?

27:18.167 --> 27:19.434
DON'T TAKE IT WRONG.

27:19.434 --> 27:21.801
I TOLD MY LAWYER
YOU'D BE HARDER TO PLAY.

27:21.801 --> 27:26.133
- WELL, IF IT'S THE TRUTH,
WHAT'S THE PLAY?

27:26.133 --> 27:27.601
- [chuckles]

27:27.601 --> 27:29.601
YOU'RE GOOD.

27:29.601 --> 27:32.634
I ALMOST MISS SEEING YOU.

27:32.634 --> 27:35.067
BUT SOMETHING'S
ALWAYS IN PLAY.

27:35.067 --> 27:36.901
THE GAME IS ENDLESS.

27:38.634 --> 27:41.367
- LOOK, SINCE YOU'RE
NOT OUR MAIN TARGET, YOU KNOW,

27:41.367 --> 27:45.300
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
FILL IN SOME BLANKS FOR ME.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.634
FRANK MARTIN
SAID AN ESCALADE WAITED

27:46.634 --> 27:50.100
WHILE YOU...
COLLECTED FROM HIM.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.067
WHO WAS WAITING
IN THE ESCALADE?

27:52.067 --> 27:54.067
- YOU KIDDING ME?

27:54.067 --> 27:57.100
- WELL, I NEED SOMETHING
MORE BASIC, YOU KNOW.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.634
LOU'S MOTIVE.

27:58.634 --> 28:02.467
- YOU'RE FAKING SINCERE.

28:02.467 --> 28:05.133
TILTING YOUR HEAD
TO THE LEFT...

28:05.133 --> 28:08.634
AND BREAKING OFF EYE CONTACT
TO PUT ME AT EASE.

28:08.634 --> 28:11.267
SAME OLD TELLS.

28:17.367 --> 28:20.300
- YOU GOT SOME TELLS
TOO, JOSH.

28:23.834 --> 28:26.601
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:26.601 --> 28:29.000
TELLS OF THE HEART
CAN'T BE HIDDEN.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.133
THE PLACES
YOU WANT ME TO GO...

28:33.133 --> 28:34.534
I'M SMARTER THAN THAT.

28:39.133 --> 28:41.200
HO HO!
HE SCORED!

28:41.200 --> 28:42.634
ALL RIGHT!

28:42.634 --> 28:44.834
NICE ONE, TOMMY!

28:44.834 --> 28:48.133
- MY OFFICE HAS SIGNED OFF ON
CHARGES AGAINST JOSH SNOW.

28:48.133 --> 28:49.734
- SO HE'LL BE ARRESTED?

28:49.734 --> 28:51.100
- YEAH, LET ME GUESS.

28:51.100 --> 28:53.334
HE'LL BE INDICTED FOR
THIRD-DEGREE MANSLAUGHTER,

28:53.334 --> 28:56.033
MAYBE RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT,
BUT NOT MURDER.

28:56.033 --> 28:57.968
- AND ARE YOU RECOMMENDING
A SUSPENDED SENTENCE?

28:57.968 --> 29:00.400
- THE IMPORTANT THING:
HE'LL BE INDICTED.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.467
- SURE, AND IT PREVENTS
LOU CARDINALE

29:02.467 --> 29:05.067
FROM GUESSING JOSH GAVE YOU
A MURDER CASE AGAINST HIM.

29:05.067 --> 29:08.534
- THEN JOSH WILL BE SAFE
UNTIL LOU IS GONE.

29:08.534 --> 29:10.234
- THAT WAS A CONSIDERATION.

29:10.234 --> 29:13.133
- I THINK...

29:13.133 --> 29:14.567
THAT YOU'RE BEING PLAYED.

29:14.567 --> 29:15.767
- BY WHO?

29:15.767 --> 29:17.033
NOT JOSH SNOW.

29:17.033 --> 29:19.567
MY OFFICE
HAS PROBABLE CAUSE

29:19.567 --> 29:22.200
TO SEARCH THE BAR AND HOME
OF LOU CARDINALE.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.334
I'D LIKE MAJOR CASE
TO EXECUTE IT.

29:30.767 --> 29:34.968
- AND I THOUGHT
ONLY ACCOUNTANTS USED EXCEL.

29:34.968 --> 29:37.934
- ANY BOOKMAKER
CAN PASS THE C.B.T.,

29:37.934 --> 29:39.634
NO SCHOOLING AT ALL.

29:39.634 --> 29:44.000
- THEY'RE LEGAL.
HE'S LICENSED TO OWN THEM.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.667
- I FIRED A KENTUCKY
SQUIRREL RIFLE ONCE.

29:46.667 --> 29:49.901
QUITE AN ART.
I DID.

29:49.901 --> 29:51.167
YOU KNOW, LOADING IT.

29:51.167 --> 29:54.267
YOU GOT TO PACK THE POWDER
AND THE BALL, YOU KNOW.

29:54.267 --> 29:56.334
- NEITHER OF THEM
IS A .38.

29:56.334 --> 29:59.801
- TRUE. OH.

29:59.801 --> 30:01.801
WHEN WE WERE HERE
LAST TIME...

30:01.801 --> 30:03.400
REMEMBER HER?

30:03.400 --> 30:04.567
- OH, I REMEMBER.

30:04.567 --> 30:06.767
LOU CALLED HER "SWEETS."

30:06.767 --> 30:08.501
HERE SHE'S STANDING
AWAY FROM LOU

30:08.501 --> 30:10.000
WITH HER ARM AROUND
ANOTHER GUY,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.234
SO AS NOT TO AROUSE
HIS WIFE'S SUSPICIONS.

30:13.234 --> 30:15.167
- LATE MODEL ESCALADE.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.634
WE CAN ENHANCE THAT
AND GET THE PLATE.

30:17.634 --> 30:21.801
- SO MAYBE WE FOUND THE DRIVER
JOSH WOULDN'T GIVE UP.

30:21.801 --> 30:24.234
- COULD HAVE
A LOVE TRIANGLE.

30:24.234 --> 30:26.834
LOU, JOSH, AND...
THIS WOMAN.

30:26.834 --> 30:29.033
- SHE BEING THE WILD CARD.

30:29.033 --> 30:32.767
- SHE ENDED UP
IN JOSH'S HAND.

30:32.767 --> 30:35.767
- BUT IF SHE'S AN ACCESSORY
TO MURDER,

30:35.767 --> 30:37.801
HOW CAN SHE DO JOSH
ANY GOOD?

30:37.801 --> 30:39.667
- IT DEPENDS ON HOW
HE PLAYS HER, RIGHT?

30:48.000 --> 30:50.267
- I UNDERSTOOD
YOU'D BE WITH YOUR ATTORNEY.

30:50.267 --> 30:53.834
- I'M EARLY.
SHE'S LATE

30:53.834 --> 30:55.334
SIT DOWN.

30:55.334 --> 30:57.334
- I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD
HOLD OFF DISCUSSIONS

30:57.334 --> 30:58.934
UNTIL YOU'RE REPRESENTED.

30:58.934 --> 31:02.000
- WHAT I WANT IS SIMPLE:
FULL IMMUNITY.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.167
- THAT CAN ONLY COME AFTER
I HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.701
- ONCE MY DEAL IS IN PLACE,

31:06.701 --> 31:08.267
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A MURDER CONVICTION

31:08.267 --> 31:09.334
ON LOU CARDINALE.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.667
- I'D LIKE THAT.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.834
BUT WE'LL NEED MORE
THAN YOUR TESTIMONY.

31:13.834 --> 31:16.300
WE'LL NEED ADDITIONAL
CORROBORATION.

31:19.367 --> 31:20.534
- THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO MEET YOU HERE

31:20.534 --> 31:22.100
AND NOT YOUR OFFICE.

31:25.634 --> 31:30.067
I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THIS
PAST SECURITY.

31:34.534 --> 31:37.501
IT'S REGISTERED TO LOU.

31:37.501 --> 31:39.000
IT'S THE MURDER WEAPON.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.400
- IT'S YOURS.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.934
- IT'S LEGAL.

31:52.934 --> 31:56.534
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S A MURDER WEAPON.

31:56.534 --> 31:59.434
- I SWEAR, I GAVE THEM BLANKS
TO SCARE PEOPLE.

31:59.434 --> 32:01.701
AND I WARNED JOSH:
STAY BACK.

32:01.701 --> 32:04.267
EVEN A BLANK
CAN CAUSE POWDER BURNS.

32:04.267 --> 32:07.133
- EVIDENCE IN THE TESTIMONY.
IT ALL LANDS ON YOU.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.601
YOU ARMED THEM
AND SENT THEM TO KILL.

32:10.601 --> 32:12.434
- SO IS SOMEBODY
GONNA MAYBE ASK ME

32:12.434 --> 32:14.534
WHY I WOULD
WANT THE GUY DEAD?

32:14.534 --> 32:17.100
- KIP WAS COMPETING WITH YOU,
RUNNING HIS OWN BOOK.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.000
- EVERY YEAR THERE'S
SOME TWINKIE LIKE HIM.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.901
ONE SEASON,
AND THEY'RE GONE.

32:20.901 --> 32:22.400
NO ONE KILLS THEM.

32:24.300 --> 32:25.801
AND I SENT THEM
TO HIS HOME,

32:25.801 --> 32:27.801
NOT THAT CRIB WHERE
HE WAS BANGING ANGELA.

32:29.601 --> 32:31.868
- KIP AND ANGELA
WERE SLEEPING TOGETHER?

32:31.868 --> 32:33.000
- SO?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.767
- SO MAYBE YOU HAD
A MORE PERSONAL REASON.

32:35.767 --> 32:37.000
- NOT ANGELA.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.501
- YOU GOT HER THE ESCALADE.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.000
- YEAH, 'CAUSE
SHE'S A DYNAMITE LAY.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.634
BUT THAT'S IT.

32:42.634 --> 32:43.767
I GOT A WIFE
AND THREE KIDS.

32:43.767 --> 32:44.934
FAMILY'S EVERYTHING TO ME.

32:46.767 --> 32:50.300
- THE FACT SHE WAS
HAVING SEX WITH KIP MCGONAGLE

32:50.300 --> 32:51.434
DIDN'T BOTHER YOU?

32:51.434 --> 32:52.968
- HE WAS ONE OF MANY.

32:52.968 --> 32:54.200
YOU START KILLING
OVER ANGELA,

32:54.200 --> 32:57.000
IT'S GONNA BE
A LARGE BODY COUNT.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.400
- TELL US HOW LONG
YOU WORKED WITH LOU CARDINALE.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.968
- THREE YEARS.

33:01.968 --> 33:03.834
WE MET IN ATLANTIC CITY.

33:03.834 --> 33:07.434
- AND EXACTLY WHAT
DID YOU DO FOR HIM?

33:07.434 --> 33:09.467
- A LOT.

33:09.467 --> 33:11.634
HE WASN'T VERY APPRECIATIVE.

33:11.634 --> 33:15.167
- KIP MCGONAGLE
OWED LOU MONEY.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.133
WHY WOULD LOU
WANT HIM DEAD?

33:17.133 --> 33:19.467
- FOR REASONS
THAT WERE PERSONAL.

33:19.467 --> 33:20.667
ME.

33:20.667 --> 33:21.701
- OH, REALLY?

33:21.701 --> 33:22.868
'CAUSE HE--LOU TOLD US

33:22.868 --> 33:24.200
THAT YOU WEREN'T
WORTH KILLING FOR.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.000
- SO? SO WHAT?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.033
I MEAN...

33:28.033 --> 33:29.968
HE'S NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU
THE WAY HE TALKS TO ME.

33:29.968 --> 33:31.934
- HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT

33:31.934 --> 33:33.667
KIP'S APARTMENT
ON MARKET STREET?

33:33.667 --> 33:37.501
- I TOOK JOSH THERE
WHEN LOU SAID TO FIND KIP.

33:37.501 --> 33:40.000
AND...

33:43.734 --> 33:46.901
OKAY, SO I KNEW
WHERE TO FIND HIM.

33:46.901 --> 33:48.701
BUT I SWEAR...

33:48.701 --> 33:52.133
I NEVER THOUGHT KIP
WOULD END UP DEAD.

33:53.467 --> 33:56.234
- WE THINK IMMUNITY FOR ANGELA
WAS A MISTAKE.

33:56.234 --> 33:57.834
- IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT SHE'S LYING.

33:57.834 --> 33:58.868
- WHAT'S WITH YOU PEOPLE?

33:58.868 --> 34:01.133
SHE BROUGHT US
THE MURDER WEAPON.

34:01.133 --> 34:02.901
- AND A STORY
THAT CONVENIENTLY

34:02.901 --> 34:05.033
HANGS EVERYTHING
ON LOU CARDINALE.

34:05.033 --> 34:06.934
- WHERE IT BELONGS.

34:06.934 --> 34:08.567
SHE WITNESSED THE CRIME.

34:08.567 --> 34:10.501
SHE'LL TESTIFY
THAT THE GUN, THE AMMO,

34:10.501 --> 34:12.900
THE ORDER TO SHOOT
KIP MCGONAGLE

34:12.900 --> 34:14.100
ALL CAME FROM LOU.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.900
- AND WOULDN'T THAT
PUT JOSH SNOW

34:16.900 --> 34:19.567
IN THE PERFECT POSITION
TO MAKE A DEAL?

34:19.567 --> 34:21.266
- QUID PRO QUO
IS AN ACCEPTED PART

34:21.266 --> 34:23.167
OF CRIMINAL LAW.

34:23.167 --> 34:24.868
LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT,
DETECTIVE.

34:26.501 --> 34:28.833
[door opens]

34:32.567 --> 34:36.234
- AH, FROM THE SEARCH
OF JOSH'S APARTMENT?

34:36.234 --> 34:41.833
- YES, IT'S JOSH'S
BETTING NUMBERS.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.667
ODD FOR A GUY WHO SWORE
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN LUCK.

34:44.667 --> 34:47.534
- WELL, MAYBE HIS WIFE'S DEATH
CHANGED HIS BELIEFS.

34:47.534 --> 34:48.934
- YEAH, BUT THIS
IS MORE RECENT.

34:48.934 --> 34:51.266
HE'S TRYING TO WORK
WINNING NUMBERS COMBINATIONS.

34:51.266 --> 34:53.634
- DON'T PEOPLE USUALLY
BET NUMBERS THEY FIND

34:53.634 --> 34:55.534
IN THEIR DAILY LIVES?

34:55.534 --> 34:57.234
- YEAH...REAL GAMBLERS
BELIEVE THEY CAN

34:57.234 --> 35:01.434
HELP PROVIDENCE, UH,
WITH A LITTLE EFFORT.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.300
JOSH PICKED 1864.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.701
IT'S WRITTEN ALL OVER
THE MARGINS OF THESE PAPERS.

35:05.701 --> 35:09.601
THEY'RE ALL DATED TWO WEEKS
BEFORE KIP'S DEATH.

35:09.601 --> 35:11.734
AND HE BET IT
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.968
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

35:13.968 --> 35:15.968
- WELL, JOSH WOULD HAVE
WANTED SOMETHING

35:15.968 --> 35:19.067
THAT WAS MATHEMATICALLY
CHALLENGING, RIGHT?

35:19.067 --> 35:21.501
SOMETHING WITH FOUR DIGITS.

35:21.501 --> 35:22.767
SQUARE ROOT.

35:22.767 --> 35:27.767
1864 IS 43.17406.

35:27.767 --> 35:31.534
BUT THE CUBE ROOT
OF THE DIGITS--

35:31.534 --> 35:35.400
OF 1864--ARE 124.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.334
- 124.
124 MARKET STREET.

35:37.334 --> 35:39.000
THAT'S KIP'S APARTMENT.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
WHERE ANGELA WAS SEEING KIP.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.100
YOU THINK HE WAS JEALOUS?

35:45.100 --> 35:46.734
- I-I DON'T THINK
HE WAS JEALOUS.

35:46.734 --> 35:49.834
I THINK HE WAS TRYING
TO BUILD THE HAND AGAINST LOU.

35:49.834 --> 35:53.834
THAT HE FOUND OUT
THAT SHE WAS CHEATING.

35:53.834 --> 35:56.901
AND THEN WHEN THE COPS
INVESTIGATE THE CRIME,

35:56.901 --> 36:00.033
THEY THINK THAT LOU
HAS A MOTIVE TO KILL KIP.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.400
- HE'S NOT WITHOUT
A CERTAIN BRILLIANCE.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.000
AND YOU THINK ALL THIS
RELATES TO JOSH'S PAST?

36:08.000 --> 36:11.033
- WELL, HIS FATHER USED HIM
AS A POKER PRODIGY.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.801
AND THEN THE MAN
WHO KILLED HIS FATHER,

36:12.801 --> 36:14.634
HE TOOK HIM IN
FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.

36:14.634 --> 36:16.133
- HE HAD VERY MIXED EMOTIONS

36:16.133 --> 36:18.367
WHEN WE SENT HIS MENTOR
TO PRISON.

36:18.367 --> 36:21.667
- SO THEN LOU BACKS HIM,
TAKES OVER THE MENTOR ROLE.

36:21.667 --> 36:24.701
DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY JOSH
IS SANDBAGGING HIM.

36:24.701 --> 36:26.033
- WELL, IT COULD BE
HE WANTS TO BREAK AWAY

36:26.033 --> 36:28.167
FROM FATHER FIGURES
WHO CONTROLLED HIM.

36:28.167 --> 36:31.000
HE'S THINKING THAT
IF HE RECLAIMS HIS LIFE,

36:31.000 --> 36:32.567
HE'LL RECLAIM HIS GAME.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.801
- IT'S WORKING.

36:33.801 --> 36:35.901
WE'VE GOT A CASE ON LOU
AND NOTHING ON HIM.

36:35.901 --> 36:37.434
- THERE'S STILL
A MAJOR PIECE MISSING.

36:37.434 --> 36:39.334
HOW DOES A GUN
LOADED WITH BLANKS

36:39.334 --> 36:41.200
KILL KIP MCGONAGLE?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.367
I BET JOSH WOULD
PLAY THAT CARD, THOUGH.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.601
- MAYBE THAT CARD
WON'T HOLD UP.

36:47.601 --> 36:50.734
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO FORCE HIS HAND.

36:54.767 --> 36:57.133
- YOU THINK LOU
MIGHT ACTUALLY BEAT THIS?

36:57.133 --> 36:59.934
- WELL, ANGELA WILL TESTIFY

36:59.934 --> 37:02.367
THAT SHE SAW YOU
LOAD BLANKS.

37:02.367 --> 37:03.934
- I'LL SWEAR TO IT.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.200
- I MEAN,
HOW COULD THIS GUN

37:08.200 --> 37:11.334
AND--AND THIS BULLET
KILL KIP MCGONAGLE?

37:11.334 --> 37:15.300
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY, I'VE GIVEN
THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.200
WHAT LOU
MUST HAVE DONE WAS...

37:17.200 --> 37:19.734
BREAK THE LEAD
OFF A LIVE ROUND,

37:19.734 --> 37:21.701
POKE IT DOWN INTO
THE BARREL OF THAT .38.

37:21.701 --> 37:24.067
- YOU MEAN TURN IT
INTO A MUZZLE LOADER?

37:24.067 --> 37:26.300
- YEAH...LIKE THE GUNS
IN HIS BAR.

37:26.300 --> 37:29.033
SO I LOAD THE BLANK
BEHIND THAT BULLET,

37:29.033 --> 37:30.267
FIRE IT...

37:30.267 --> 37:31.367
IT'S DEADLY.

37:31.367 --> 37:32.667
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THAT COULD WORK.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.567
- IT DID WORK.

37:35.567 --> 37:38.234
- SOMETHING I'LL REGRET
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

37:38.234 --> 37:39.400
- KILLING KIP OR...

37:39.400 --> 37:42.667
GETTING PLAYED?

37:42.667 --> 37:45.767
- GETTING PLAYED?

37:45.767 --> 37:48.200
- YEAH, WELL, YOUR GAME
HAD GONE BAD.

37:48.200 --> 37:52.033
YOU NEEDED TO TURN
YOURSELF AROUND, RIGHT?

37:52.033 --> 37:53.601
- [scoffs]

37:55.501 --> 37:57.167
YOU'RE WRONG.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.200
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
LOU GOES DOWN,

37:59.200 --> 38:00.701
YOU GET A SUSPENDED SENTENCE

38:00.701 --> 38:03.501
AND WHAT'S LEFT
OF LOU'S EMPIRE: ANGELA.

38:03.501 --> 38:05.234
- KNOWING ANGELA
WAS CHEATING ON LOU

38:05.234 --> 38:07.133
SET EVERYTHING IN MOTION.

38:07.133 --> 38:09.567
- JOSH, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

38:09.567 --> 38:10.934
- THEY'RE FISHING.

38:10.934 --> 38:12.033
IT'S THEIR GAME.

38:12.033 --> 38:15.200
- IF HE GOT YOU TO LIE
IN YOUR PROFFER,

38:15.200 --> 38:17.334
YOUR IMMUNITY IS GONE.

38:27.133 --> 38:30.567
- JOSH...

38:30.567 --> 38:33.501
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GOOD AT CARD TRICKS.

38:33.501 --> 38:36.067
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE
AMAZING WITH YOUR HANDS.

38:36.067 --> 38:38.234
THAT HE CAN PALM
A LIVE ROUND.

38:38.234 --> 38:39.367
[chamber clicks]

38:43.667 --> 38:44.934
DID I JUST LOAD THIS?

38:44.934 --> 38:46.334
- YEAH.

38:46.334 --> 38:47.834
- YEAH?
DID YOU SEE ME LOAD IT?

38:47.834 --> 38:49.300
- SURE.

38:49.300 --> 38:50.434
- CAREFUL WITH THAT.

38:50.434 --> 38:52.367
- WHY?

38:52.367 --> 38:54.934
IS IT LOADED OR--
OR IS IT EMPTY?

38:54.934 --> 38:56.701
- I KNOW WHAT I SAW.
WHAT IS THIS?

38:56.701 --> 38:58.434
- OH, YEAH?
YOU WANT TO BET?

38:58.434 --> 39:00.300
YOU WANT TO BET
THAT I DON'T HAVE THE RAGE

39:00.300 --> 39:01.767
TO TAKE A LIFE,
LIKE YOU DID?

39:01.767 --> 39:03.367
- I DON'T HAVE RAGE, GOREN.

39:03.367 --> 39:04.534
- OH, YEAH?

39:07.300 --> 39:10.667
- YOU KNOW, YOU LET
PENELOPE DIE.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.801
- I DIDN'T LET HER DIE.
DON'T YOU EVER SAY THAT.

39:12.801 --> 39:14.300
- YEAH, YOU DID.
IT'S OBVIOUS.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.300
YOUR RAGE, YOU KNOW,

39:15.300 --> 39:17.534
IT DESTROYED YOUR ABILITY--

39:17.534 --> 39:19.567
YOUR ABILITY
TO READ THINGS.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.033
- I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.

39:21.033 --> 39:23.200
- YOU DID!
- THERE'S A LIVE ROUND IN THERE.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.067
- NO, YOU MISSED.

39:25.067 --> 39:28.400
YOU DID, YOU MISSED
HER TREMORS, YOU KNOW.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.534
HER SLURRED SPEECH.
HER--HER DIZZY SPELLS.

39:31.534 --> 39:33.601
AND NOW I'M PLAYING YOU.

39:33.601 --> 39:35.100
- NO ONE'S PLAYING ME.

39:42.968 --> 39:47.968
- YOU MISSED HER TELLS, JOSH.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.033
- MISSED HER TELLS?

39:49.033 --> 39:50.267
- YES.

39:50.267 --> 39:51.934
- I MISSED HER TELLS, HUH?

39:51.934 --> 39:53.868
I MISSED--I MISSED GLASS

39:53.868 --> 39:56.167
BREAKING IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT?

39:56.167 --> 39:59.000
I MISSED HER IN THE KITCHEN
WITH ALL THE LIGHTS ON,

39:59.000 --> 40:00.567
TELLING ME THAT IT'S DARK?

40:00.567 --> 40:02.567
TELLING ME SHE CAN'T SEE,

40:02.567 --> 40:04.567
HER FEET CUT AND BLEEDING

40:04.567 --> 40:07.167
FROM THE MUSTARD JAR
THAT SHE DROPPED?

40:07.167 --> 40:09.100
I HELD HER
AND I CLEANED UP THE GLASS.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.400
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER.
IT WAS TOO LATE.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.601
- AND WHERE WERE YOU
FOR THE EARLY SIGNS?

40:12.601 --> 40:13.901
ATLANTIC CITY?
LAS VEGAS?

40:13.901 --> 40:15.100
WERE YOU AT LOU'S TABLES?

40:15.100 --> 40:16.701
- HE SAID,
"YOU'RE SLACKING, JOSH!

40:16.701 --> 40:18.334
"IT'S TIME AT THE TABLES
THAT MAKES A CHAMPION.

40:18.334 --> 40:20.634
ALL WIVES CALL AND COMPLAIN."

40:20.634 --> 40:22.901
LIKE I CARED ABOUT
THE TABLES, YOU KNOW?

40:22.901 --> 40:25.701
ALL I WANTED
WAS TO BE WITH HER.

40:25.701 --> 40:29.901
HE TOOK THAT AWAY FROM ME.

40:29.901 --> 40:31.300
- HE PLAYED YOU.

40:31.300 --> 40:34.267
LOU PLAYED YOU,
LIKE I'M PLAYING YOU NOW.

40:34.267 --> 40:35.868
- NO, NO, I PLAYED HIM.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.901
HE'S IN JAIL RIGHT NOW,
PISSING HIMSELF

40:37.901 --> 40:41.200
BECAUSE I PUT HIM THERE--
FOR HER.

40:44.667 --> 40:46.100
- AND YOU KILLED
KIP MCGONAGLE?

40:46.100 --> 40:49.200
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DID.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.901
IT WAS PART OF THE GAME.

40:50.901 --> 40:52.167
NOBODY PLAYS ME.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.167
[trigger snaps]

41:00.968 --> 41:02.567
- YOU SEE?
YOU'RE WRONG.

41:05.033 --> 41:07.901
JOSH...

41:07.901 --> 41:09.467
IT'S AN OLD
MAGICIAN'S TRICK.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.133
YOU SEE?
BEESWAX ON THE THUMB.

41:12.133 --> 41:13.868
IT'S JUST...

41:13.868 --> 41:16.100
JUST AN OLD TRICK.

41:19.801 --> 41:22.968
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO...

41:22.968 --> 41:25.934
CALL YOUR LAWYER.

41:25.934 --> 41:29.133
TELL HIM TO MEET YOU
DOWNTOWN, OKAY?
