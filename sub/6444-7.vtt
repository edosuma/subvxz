00:21.528 --> 00:22.705
- hey.
- hey.

00:23.612 --> 00:25.110
what are you doing in metropolis ?

00:25.138 --> 00:28.385
i had to pick up some tractor parts for
my dad, and i got your text message, so

00:28.414 --> 00:29.751
i brought you some brain food.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.264
i don't remember texting you.

00:33.873 --> 00:35.468
is that chow mein ?

00:36.254 --> 00:37.029
yeah.

00:39.648 --> 00:40.904
what were you working on ?

00:42.242 --> 00:44.614
oh, just some astronomy
homework, you know...

00:44.637 --> 00:49.487
numbers and equations and things that i don't
really understand yet, but i'm starting to.

00:52.939 --> 00:53.960
chow mein.

00:54.475 --> 00:57.023
oh, this was, uh...
this was at your door.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.796
oh, that's weird.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.334
let's open it.

01:03.986 --> 01:07.455
"given your new major, i thought you
might find this interesting... lex."

01:07.737 --> 01:09.322
lex is sending you gifts ?

01:11.492 --> 01:12.772
are you okay ?

01:14.310 --> 01:15.789
just a scratch.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.075
it's a meteor rock,

01:23.427 --> 01:25.411
but i haven't seen one like this before.

01:25.682 --> 01:28.864
i gotta go. my dad's probably
waiting for those parts.

01:29.251 --> 01:30.284
hi...

01:30.836 --> 01:32.571
and bye.

01:33.404 --> 01:37.561
has my deodorant gone south ? why
is he in such a hurry to bail ?

01:37.584 --> 01:39.272
i have no idea.

01:39.308 --> 01:42.149
i guess clark's just not into geology.

02:49.291 --> 02:50.888
what the hell's wrong with you ?!

03:30.506 --> 03:31.292
hello ?

03:32.443 --> 03:34.545
<i>clark, i know who you are.</i>

03:53.751 --> 03:55.908
"Splinter"

04:45.939 --> 04:48.834
it's bad enough he owns half the
state of kansas. now he wants to

04:48.904 --> 04:50.926
tell us what we need
to do with our lives.

04:51.047 --> 04:52.045
jonathan,

04:52.209 --> 04:55.356
i know senator jennings asked you
to run after he had to step down,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.335
but i'm not gonna let
you risk your health.

04:57.388 --> 05:00.507
sweetheart, i feel fine.
i really do. i'm fine.

05:00.554 --> 05:02.459
the election is in january.

05:02.506 --> 05:06.633
putting together a campaign in that amount of time...
who knows what the stress could do to your heart ?

05:06.656 --> 05:10.801
what about watching lex luthor get sworn in as
state senator ? that kind of stress could kill me.

05:10.825 --> 05:15.344
if you run, every reporter in kansas
will be digging into our lives.

05:15.379 --> 05:17.798
what if somebody finds
out about clark's secret ?

05:17.845 --> 05:19.554
i think someone already has.

05:20.294 --> 05:21.821
clark, what happened ?

05:22.643 --> 05:25.367
someone ran me off the road
on my way back from metropolis.

05:26.153 --> 05:27.548
did you see who it was ?

05:27.595 --> 05:30.683
no. by the time i got back to
the road, they were already gone.

05:31.341 --> 05:34.558
then i got a phone call, and a weird
voice said, "i know who you are."

05:37.882 --> 05:39.032
look, clark,

05:39.549 --> 05:42.344
i think the best thing you can do
is just stick to your normal routine.

05:42.379 --> 05:43.938
don't do anything unusual.

05:44.032 --> 05:47.496
if these people are trying to expose you, then
they're gonna be watching everything you do.

05:47.531 --> 05:49.492
let's not give them anything to gawk at.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.589
brutus and caesar.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.100
jesus and judas.

06:00.087 --> 06:03.337
they all started out as
best friends. what happened ?

06:04.328 --> 06:07.146
well, if history teaches us one thing,

06:07.193 --> 06:13.535
it's that even the most powerful men can
be betrayed by those they trust the most.

06:14.039 --> 06:18.253
the reason betrayal is such a predominant
theme throughout history is really quite simple.

06:19.392 --> 06:21.506
duplicity is human nature.

06:26.273 --> 06:28.995
these classes getting
shorter or is it just me ?

06:55.776 --> 06:58.137
<i>I know how to kill you.</i>

07:14.736 --> 07:15.593
clark...

07:16.943 --> 07:19.986
is everything okay ? you
look a little stressed out.

07:21.429 --> 07:23.871
something really weird
just happened after class.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.830
and yesterday, a truck
tried to run me off the road.

07:27.255 --> 07:28.769
it wasn't black, was it ?

07:29.613 --> 07:30.622
yeah, how'd you know ?

07:30.660 --> 07:33.231
because i think the same
one's been following me.

07:34.133 --> 07:35.437
do you have any idea why ?

07:35.965 --> 07:39.910
we've been, uh, fishing some dangerous waters.
maybe the shark's finally getting testy.

07:39.935 --> 07:40.734
lex.

07:41.274 --> 07:43.059
never thought he'd take it this far.

07:43.235 --> 07:45.019
i'm sorry for pulling you into this.

07:45.475 --> 07:46.637
i'm gonna go talk to him.

07:46.661 --> 07:50.195
no, let's not jump the gun. we need
to figure out if it's him first.

07:50.230 --> 07:51.381
how do we do that ?

07:52.755 --> 07:55.667
i jotted down the license
plate of the truck.

07:56.159 --> 07:59.012
do you know anyone who could
find out who it's registered to ?

07:59.435 --> 08:01.290
my friend chloe could dig it up.

08:02.441 --> 08:06.104
i'll check with campus security, see if
they've had any other reports about that truck.

08:06.149 --> 08:06.853
thanks.

08:06.877 --> 08:10.411
listen, clark, whatever happens, we're
in this together. remember that, okay ?

08:17.468 --> 08:19.245
how long do you think
this is gonna take ?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.981
we should get a fax response
in just a couple of minutes.

08:22.028 --> 08:25.010
what do you want to bet that
that truck's registered to luthor ?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.429
i don't know, clark.

08:27.464 --> 08:30.622
lex comes from more of the rube
goldberg school of villainy.

08:30.669 --> 08:34.047
i think this sort of direct
attack isn't really his style.

08:34.070 --> 08:35.941
there's only one way to find out.

08:36.054 --> 08:38.027
i'll go check the fax machine.

08:41.357 --> 08:42.582
<i>1 new message</i>

08:52.067 --> 08:53.874
<i>There are no secrets.</i>

08:53.875 --> 08:56.000
okay, clark, we've got a problem.

08:56.024 --> 08:59.558
according to the dmv, your
mysterious black truck doesn't exist.

08:59.593 --> 09:02.828
- are you sure the license-plate numbers are...
- why are you getting messages from lionel luthor ?

09:04.377 --> 09:07.124
- you read my e-mails ?
- just answer the question.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.752
my job at the daily planet requires me
to talk to a lot of different people,

09:10.787 --> 09:12.924
including moral pygmies
like lionel luthor.

09:12.948 --> 09:14.944
what did you tell him about me ?

09:15.038 --> 09:17.033
what are you talking about ?
i didn't tell him anything.

09:17.068 --> 09:21.201
there are three people in smallville who
know about my secret... my mom, my dad..

09:21.952 --> 09:22.845
and you.

09:25.322 --> 09:27.483
you think i told lionel your secret ?

09:27.753 --> 09:30.238
clark, i would never, ever do that.

09:32.422 --> 09:34.347
i can't believe i trusted you.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.496
clark, i didn't say anything.

09:43.088 --> 09:46.657
i'm paying you for results,
griff, not excuses. get it done.

09:47.867 --> 09:49.487
i'll have to call you back.

09:50.568 --> 09:52.082
is this a bad time ?

09:52.564 --> 09:54.783
for you, never.

09:56.133 --> 09:59.116
i wanted to thank you for that
rock that you sent me. it's...

09:59.162 --> 10:01.942
it's an amazing find. i would
love to know more about it.

10:02.623 --> 10:04.385
what rock would that be ?

10:06.980 --> 10:08.905
uh, the silver meteor rock.

10:10.611 --> 10:14.827
that sounds very intriguing, but i've
never seen a silver meteor rock before.

10:15.144 --> 10:16.823
it wasn't from me, lana.

10:17.844 --> 10:20.651
it came with a note from you, lex.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.371
someone's obviously playing a game with
you because i don't know anything about it.

10:26.087 --> 10:30.350
just like you don't know anything about the
spaceship that landed during the last meteor shower.

10:30.385 --> 10:32.111
- that's different.
- why ?

10:33.532 --> 10:35.540
why is it different, lex ?

10:39.641 --> 10:43.445
because there are some doors that
can't be closed once they're opened.

10:44.702 --> 10:45.582
thanks.

10:46.862 --> 10:48.917
did you get that from a fortune cookie ?

10:48.952 --> 10:50.643
what i'm trying to say...

10:52.075 --> 10:53.719
everything i've done,

10:54.610 --> 10:56.126
it's all been to protect you.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.626
i don't need to be protected, lex.

10:59.061 --> 11:00.564
i need the truth.

11:05.673 --> 11:07.716
then i have something to show you.

11:19.153 --> 11:20.433
it's real.

11:21.478 --> 11:22.863
yes, it is.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.808
and i want you to help me get inside

11:25.832 --> 11:28.215
and understand exactly
what we're dealing with.

11:42.027 --> 11:44.775
the hardworking all-american farmer.

11:45.319 --> 11:47.949
i can already see the campaign poster.

11:48.043 --> 11:52.059
no tv spot, unfortunately, considering
your state of your finances.

11:52.094 --> 11:53.008
look,

11:53.442 --> 11:56.859
i don't know how you knew that i was
considering running for state senate,

11:56.894 --> 11:58.867
but if you came here to try to
strong-arm me into quitting...

11:58.902 --> 12:02.025
no, on the contrary, i am
here to offer my support.

12:02.060 --> 12:06.804
you'll need considerable amounts of
money and influence to win this election.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.847
you have a more than, um,

12:08.882 --> 12:12.076
<i>shall we say, privileged adversary.</i>

12:14.094 --> 12:16.290
so, you want to back me for senate

12:16.361 --> 12:19.073
running against your son.
why would you want to do that ?

12:21.926 --> 12:24.900
lex is an extraordinary young man.

12:24.935 --> 12:28.610
he's always had an
extraordinary appetite for power.

12:29.667 --> 12:34.000
but, um, if he succeeds in this
first foray into the political arena,

12:34.021 --> 12:38.788
i'm afraid he'll develop such a fierce taste
for it, he'll go on to devour the whole world.

12:38.835 --> 12:41.857
guess the apple doesn't
fall that far from the tree.

12:44.218 --> 12:47.493
i know you don't trust me,
jonathan. you have no reason to,

12:47.904 --> 12:51.263
but i'm asking you to
accept my offer of support.

12:54.152 --> 12:55.866
i know about clark.

12:58.766 --> 13:02.403
chloe sullivan has supplied me
with all the information i need...

13:02.920 --> 13:04.528
his true identity,

13:04.716 --> 13:07.675
the powers he possesses and uses.

13:07.898 --> 13:10.305
i know he's vulnerable to kryptonite.

13:14.718 --> 13:16.292
accept my support,

13:16.491 --> 13:19.556
and i can guarantee you
a seat in the senate.

13:32.952 --> 13:34.593
and what happens if i don't accept ?

13:35.004 --> 13:37.740
the truth about clark
will come out in any case.

13:37.764 --> 13:41.310
the only difference is how he'll
be treated when we run the tests.

13:41.885 --> 13:47.195
he can either be a distinguished guest
or strapped down, helpless like a lab rat.

13:49.837 --> 13:51.328
it's your choice.

14:09.097 --> 14:10.917
it's so smooth.

14:11.317 --> 14:13.430
it almost feels like liquid.

14:13.994 --> 14:16.095
frictionless surface.

14:16.577 --> 14:19.005
at least, that's what
my experts tell me.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.976
you've been studying it this whole time,

14:23.052 --> 14:26.638
and you let me go on thinking that what i
saw the day of the meteor shower wasn't real,

14:26.671 --> 14:28.095
that i was losing my mind.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.892
i didn't mean to make you question your
sanity, lana. i was just trying to protect you.

14:31.927 --> 14:35.461
you keep saying that, lex. what do
you think you're protecting me from ?

14:36.116 --> 14:37.197
this ship

14:38.347 --> 14:42.457
is one of the most important
discoveries in the history of mankind.

14:42.962 --> 14:45.686
there are people who have
killed for a lot less.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.367
now, if i had told you the truth
and something happened to you,

14:52.106 --> 14:53.762
i'd never forgive myself.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.200
so, what changed ?

14:57.681 --> 14:59.583
i couldn't lie to you anymore.

15:01.309 --> 15:03.376
is that the real reason ?

15:04.750 --> 15:07.666
or is it because you and
your scientists are stumped ?

15:07.830 --> 15:10.965
because i'm the only person on
earth who's seen this thing open up.

15:13.372 --> 15:19.673
this is a chance to finally get answers to questions
that have been haunting you since your parents died.

15:20.025 --> 15:22.491
the meteors that killed them, the ship,

15:22.620 --> 15:26.319
all the strange things that happen in
smallville... it's all tied together.

15:27.823 --> 15:30.993
i'm offering you the
opportunity of a lifetime.

15:32.285 --> 15:34.668
whether or not you take it is up to you.

15:40.775 --> 15:41.843
hi, clark.

15:43.311 --> 15:45.084
your dad was looking for you.

15:45.107 --> 15:47.033
i just saw him in the
barn with lionel luthor.

15:47.115 --> 15:48.064
lionel ?

15:49.015 --> 15:52.526
oh, there he is. clark, why don't you come
on out and give me a hand with the tractor ?

15:52.573 --> 15:53.524
where is it ?

15:53.723 --> 15:55.719
oh, it's by the barn...

15:55.755 --> 15:57.173
- where is it ?
- whoa, hey !

15:57.220 --> 15:58.101
clark !

15:58.207 --> 16:00.802
- what are you doing, clark ?
- see ? he got this from lionel luthor.

16:00.825 --> 16:03.573
- he's helping him put me in the lab !
- what ?

16:03.866 --> 16:04.770
clark,

16:05.052 --> 16:07.823
lionel stopped by to
talk about the campaign.

16:08.574 --> 16:12.426
sure, he brought me lex's balance sheet
so i could see what i was up against.

16:12.461 --> 16:14.877
- what about the money ?
- what money ?

16:14.948 --> 16:16.275
this money !

16:18.799 --> 16:20.748
why you doing this to me, dad ?

16:21.312 --> 16:22.343
why you doing this ?

16:22.378 --> 16:23.235
hey !

16:23.271 --> 16:24.856
clark, stop it !

16:26.957 --> 16:27.815
martha !

16:28.648 --> 16:29.400
hey !

16:33.741 --> 16:35.032
no more lies.

16:36.453 --> 16:37.874
tell me the truth.

16:38.555 --> 16:39.400
tell me !

16:39.435 --> 16:41.032
you want the truth ?

16:42.393 --> 16:44.389
you're not really my son.

16:45.822 --> 16:48.511
you're just a thing i
found in the corn field.

16:54.489 --> 16:57.659
clark, please. i don't want
to do this. just calm down.

16:59.033 --> 17:00.677
you're all in this together.

17:01.008 --> 17:02.651
- clark...
- I knew it.

17:12.627 --> 17:14.271
mrs. kent, are you all right ?

17:14.905 --> 17:15.867
chloe,

17:16.195 --> 17:18.345
how long have you known about clark ?

17:18.991 --> 17:20.605
since last year.

17:21.356 --> 17:22.460
yeah, um...

17:23.398 --> 17:25.428
how much did he tell you, chloe ?

17:25.675 --> 17:29.185
well, everything, i think. i mean,

17:29.232 --> 17:32.684
that's how i knew about the kryptonite
he kept hidden in the barn. I...

17:32.743 --> 17:35.300
i just came by to check on him,
and i heard all this commotion.

17:35.324 --> 17:37.414
what's happening ? why
is he acting this way ?

17:37.449 --> 17:41.594
i don't know. he came to visit me at the
daily planet, and he just freaked out.

17:41.641 --> 17:44.774
he was accusing me of revealing
his secrets to lionel luthor,

17:44.797 --> 17:46.887
and then i tried to explain it
to him, and he wouldn't listen.

17:46.922 --> 17:48.942
it was like he was a
totally different person.

17:48.977 --> 17:50.891
it must be red kryptonite.

17:50.936 --> 17:54.270
sweetheart, this is... it's
different somehow. i don't think so.

17:54.564 --> 17:55.985
red kryptonite ?

17:56.020 --> 17:59.249
there's another kind of kryptonite.
it's red instead of green.

17:59.296 --> 18:01.560
it changes clark's personality.

18:01.795 --> 18:05.646
he loses all his inhibitions
and becomes very unpredictable.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.120
what about silver kryptonite ?

18:11.952 --> 18:12.983
silver ?

18:14.310 --> 18:17.128
i think i may know
what's gotten into clark.

18:24.467 --> 18:25.160
lana.

18:25.653 --> 18:27.907
clark, what are you doing here ?

18:27.942 --> 18:29.340
waiting for you.

18:29.798 --> 18:31.265
get your stuff together. we gotta go.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.098
go where ?

18:32.145 --> 18:34.682
up north. i know a place.
he'll never find us.

18:34.705 --> 18:36.866
okay, wait. slow down. what's going on ?

18:36.889 --> 18:38.803
- they turned against me, lana.
- who did ?

18:38.850 --> 18:40.799
chloe, my parents.

18:41.104 --> 18:43.014
you're the only one i can trust now.

18:43.266 --> 18:44.452
you're the only one.

18:44.487 --> 18:47.194
- whatever they did, it can't be that bad.
- no, lana, you don't...

18:48.432 --> 18:50.123
she's coming. she's coming.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.371
chloe's coming. all right, listen,

18:52.406 --> 18:55.212
i promise i'll come back to
you. Alright, I'll find you.

18:55.236 --> 18:56.974
just whatever you do, don't
listen to a word they say.

18:56.997 --> 18:58.899
clark, i'm just gonna call your parents.

19:03.336 --> 19:06.037
lana, thank god. has clark been here ?

19:06.495 --> 19:07.281
why ?

19:07.798 --> 19:11.649
'cause i need to talk to him. did he
ever touch that silver rock you had ?

19:14.123 --> 19:15.790
he's been here, hasn't he ?

19:24.185 --> 19:25.759
he told me not to trust you.

19:25.947 --> 19:31.935
okay, clark's gone all captain paranoid, and i think
it might be because of that silver meteor you have.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.011
he did prick his finger with it.

19:34.035 --> 19:37.175
lana, clark's been infected. he
thinks everyone's turned against him.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.304
he's gonna end up
seriously hurting someone.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.680
do you know where he went ?

19:41.844 --> 19:44.944
he was here for a second, and then he was
just gone. chloe, the way he was acting...

19:44.968 --> 19:46.694
Yeah, I know. It's gonna be ok, um...

19:46.729 --> 19:50.251
i'm gonna call the kents. they're looking for him back in
smallville. i'll cover the campus and see if i can find him.

19:50.287 --> 19:52.645
- i'm gonna come with you.
- no. lana, don't.

19:52.680 --> 19:57.165
um, you stay here, and if he shows up,
just call me and try and keep him calm.

19:57.201 --> 19:59.584
i think you're the only one
he'll listen to right now.

20:23.818 --> 20:24.804
clark,

20:25.039 --> 20:27.376
i was wondering if you'd forgotten
about me. is everything all right ?

20:27.423 --> 20:28.186
no.

20:28.315 --> 20:30.288
chloe's in on it,
too, so are my parents.

20:30.507 --> 20:31.775
in on what ?

20:31.822 --> 20:35.556
the black truck that's been following us around...
did you get any information from campus security ?

20:35.591 --> 20:36.636
campus security ?

20:36.672 --> 20:38.985
you said you were gonna talk to them
earlier today when i told you about it.

20:39.008 --> 20:42.119
clark, i haven't seen
you in over a week.

20:42.155 --> 20:44.665
no, no. we spoke this morning.

20:44.688 --> 20:47.894
after class we talked about it... the black
truck. you were gonna talk to campus security.

20:47.917 --> 20:50.864
i had a class, but you weren't in it.

20:50.888 --> 20:53.776
yes, i was. no, i... yes.
no, we talked. i know...

20:53.811 --> 20:55.032
look, clark, um...

20:57.181 --> 20:59.454
look, i got a faculty meeting right now,

20:59.497 --> 21:02.162
but why don't you wait
for me in my office,

21:02.215 --> 21:04.845
and i'll make an excuse...
i'll be right back. clark,

21:05.009 --> 21:07.756
whatever is happening,
we're in this together.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.185
who's there ?

21:50.443 --> 21:51.688
what is this ?!

21:51.723 --> 21:56.279
<i>investigation into clark kent has
yielded a surprising revelation.</i>

21:56.690 --> 22:00.111
<i>clark kent is not of this
earth. he is an alien,</i>

22:00.158 --> 22:02.976
<i>an intruder from a distant galaxy,</i>

22:03.000 --> 22:05.066
<i>first vanguard of an invasion.</i>

22:05.101 --> 22:06.088
no !

22:07.015 --> 22:08.741
no ! that's not what i am !

22:08.765 --> 22:13.894
<i>but i know his weakness. i know how to stop
this strange visitor from another planet.</i>

22:18.920 --> 22:21.081
<i>i'm the one that's
gonna kill you, clark.</i>

22:38.038 --> 22:40.686
i should have known you'd
pull something like this.

22:41.214 --> 22:43.750
you can't stand to see
us together, can you ?

22:46.287 --> 22:49.856
i think this is the part where i usually
say, "lana, what are you talking about ?"

22:49.881 --> 22:53.615
i don't know how, but you knew what
would happen when you sent this to me.

23:01.309 --> 23:05.172
i swear, this is the first time i've
ever seen a meteor rock like this.

23:05.912 --> 23:08.871
i don't have time for any
more of your lies, lex.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.956
what did that do to clark ?

23:14.457 --> 23:18.132
i just shared the most important
secret in the world with you today.

23:18.426 --> 23:21.077
what would i have to
gain by lying to you now ?

23:22.921 --> 23:25.833
if you didn't send this
to me, then who did ?

23:25.856 --> 23:27.465
i honestly don't know.

23:28.756 --> 23:31.022
now, you said this
did something to clark.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.208
what happened ?

23:34.369 --> 23:36.388
chloe thinks it infected him.

23:36.799 --> 23:38.842
he's acting all paranoid,

23:39.387 --> 23:43.179
like everyone's turning against him. lex,
the way that he looked when i saw him...

23:43.215 --> 23:44.612
listen to me.

23:45.352 --> 23:49.203
we'll take this to luthorcorp and
get my best people working on a cure.

23:49.649 --> 23:53.076
whatever's happening to clark, i
promise i'll find a way to help him.

23:55.119 --> 23:56.246
thank you.

23:59.968 --> 24:01.469
you're my partner now.

24:02.114 --> 24:03.770
it's the least i can do.

24:06.424 --> 24:08.643
i'm sorry that i
didn't trust you, lex. i

24:08.701 --> 24:12.433
i know we've had our differences,
but you have always been there for me.

24:13.982 --> 24:15.227
and i always will be.

25:09.549 --> 25:13.282
call in as many people as you need.
i want an update every 30 minutes.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.029
my security team is coordinating
with chloe and the kents.

25:16.076 --> 25:17.638
they're not gonna hurt him, are they ?

25:17.673 --> 25:20.397
if that happens, somebody's
getting transferred to siberia.

25:20.444 --> 25:24.793
look, let's get this sample over to luthorcorp. the sooner
we have it analyzed, the faster we'll be able to help clark.

25:30.359 --> 25:31.744
stay here.

25:32.202 --> 25:33.808
i'll see what's going on.

26:37.258 --> 26:38.949
a lot of people are
looking for you, clark.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.053
i know they are.

26:40.898 --> 26:43.058
i want you to listen
to me very carefully.

26:45.289 --> 26:47.297
something's happened to you.

26:47.723 --> 26:48.591
yeah.

26:49.002 --> 26:50.552
it's been a revelation.

26:51.092 --> 26:53.969
clark, you're very sick. we
need to get you to the lab.

26:54.016 --> 26:55.472
we should get to the lab.

26:55.543 --> 26:58.382
we should get to the lab
so you can experiment on me.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.494
you know, lex, it all makes sense now.

27:02.785 --> 27:05.051
see, i thought you
were obsessed with me.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.775
but it's not about me at
all, is it ? it's about lana.

27:10.114 --> 27:11.840
- it's always been lana.
- clark.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.742
and all these things
that you do to me...

27:14.083 --> 27:15.409
all the digging,

27:15.574 --> 27:19.779
all the tests, all the lies... it was just to get me
out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.

27:20.695 --> 27:23.292
listen to what you're
saying, clark. this isn't you.

27:23.327 --> 27:24.560
i don't know what you did.

27:24.936 --> 27:29.022
i'm not sure what you did to trick her
into believing she was in love with you.

27:30.114 --> 27:31.546
but i'm not gonna let
you get away with it.

27:31.852 --> 27:33.024
i need you to stop.

27:36.229 --> 27:37.638
i don't want to hurt you.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.507
but i want to hurt you.

28:10.096 --> 28:10.860
lana !

28:27.592 --> 28:28.461
lana !

28:32.850 --> 28:34.813
lana, i know you're down here !

28:35.198 --> 28:36.619
come on, i want to...

28:36.866 --> 28:38.192
i want to talk.

28:42.559 --> 28:43.416
lana !

28:45.429 --> 28:47.331
we were meant to be together.

29:04.191 --> 29:05.999
it's okay, lana, i'm here.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.896
whatever lex was doing
to you, i stopped it.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.139
oh, god.

29:11.245 --> 29:13.546
what did you do ? did you hurt him ?

29:16.059 --> 29:18.090
why do you care about him so much ?

29:22.380 --> 29:25.228
clark, whatever you think lex did,
it's all part of some delusion.

29:25.293 --> 29:28.672
- i saw you kiss him.
- no, i would never do that.

29:29.095 --> 29:30.504
stop lying.

29:31.772 --> 29:33.440
stop lying.

29:35.979 --> 29:37.341
i loved you, lana...

29:38.116 --> 29:42.179
more than anything else, i loved you,
and you betrayed me like everyone else.

29:44.527 --> 29:45.335
clark...

29:47.343 --> 29:48.693
...you don't want to do that.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.030
trust me.

29:53.319 --> 29:55.385
i can't trust anyone anymore.

30:08.304 --> 30:10.218
you one of lex's experiments ?

30:10.265 --> 30:11.134
no.

30:11.508 --> 30:15.982
i'm your friend. if you
hurt lana, it'll destroy you.

30:44.996 --> 30:46.240
what the hell are you ?

30:46.264 --> 30:47.567
i'm a kryptonian,

30:47.767 --> 30:49.023
just like you.

30:49.556 --> 30:50.859
and i'm sorry...

30:52.632 --> 30:54.628
...but this is really gonna hurt.

31:13.662 --> 31:15.822
you'll be all right now, kal-el.

31:16.492 --> 31:17.243
lana !

31:20.472 --> 31:21.212
lana.

31:34.714 --> 31:35.572
clark.

31:48.572 --> 31:50.262
what have you done ?

32:05.745 --> 32:06.449
hi.

32:11.616 --> 32:13.083
um, you know,

32:13.874 --> 32:17.796
the caffeine in my system is getting
to a dangerously normal level.

32:17.913 --> 32:20.133
i'm gonna go get a cup.

32:29.819 --> 32:31.216
- lana, i am...
- clark...

32:32.320 --> 32:33.424
it's okay.

32:34.398 --> 32:36.128
chloe told me everything.

32:37.478 --> 32:38.394
she did ?

32:38.676 --> 32:39.462
yeah.

32:42.738 --> 32:45.194
how that silver meteor infected you,

32:45.241 --> 32:48.106
how it made you think that
everyone was out to get you.

32:50.185 --> 32:54.188
even that it gave you some
sort of temporary powers.

32:59.691 --> 33:03.284
lana, you know i would never
do anything to hurt you.

33:04.951 --> 33:06.372
of course i know that.

33:13.647 --> 33:15.855
clark, whatever you think you saw,

33:15.902 --> 33:18.517
it was just the meteor
playing tricks with your mind.

33:18.564 --> 33:19.985
it wasn't real.

33:21.195 --> 33:24.529
there could never, ever be
anything between me and lex.

33:31.575 --> 33:34.510
i was imagining some pretty crazy stuff.

33:37.481 --> 33:39.759
chloe turning against me...

33:40.145 --> 33:42.529
my dad making a deal with lionel...

33:44.537 --> 33:47.190
...you and lex talking
about a spaceship.

33:54.228 --> 33:55.284
yeah.

33:55.836 --> 33:58.549
i'm... i'm just glad
you're all right, clark.

34:10.580 --> 34:12.237
thanks for covering for me.

34:12.812 --> 34:14.150
of course, clark.

34:15.454 --> 34:21.581
you know, i have to admit, for once in my life, i
was actually glad i wasn't the object of your desire.

34:22.543 --> 34:25.080
you know, you're just lucky you
snapped out of it when you did.

34:26.759 --> 34:29.553
- if i'd have killed lana...
- but you didn't,

34:29.788 --> 34:33.907
so stop beating yourself up about it.
i mean, silver kryptonite... who knew ?

34:33.929 --> 34:35.797
i just don't want it to happen again.

34:35.833 --> 34:37.300
did you get that rock ?

34:37.594 --> 34:38.333
no.

34:39.482 --> 34:43.344
i went to see lex, and he said it
just disappeared during the excitement.

34:43.416 --> 34:47.208
not that he ever even admitted he sent
the rock to lana in the first place.

34:47.291 --> 34:49.936
i still don't trust him.
it's not about being paranoid.

34:49.983 --> 34:52.025
yeah, well, he is a luthor.

34:52.367 --> 34:54.774
you know, um, speaking
of the evil dynasty,

34:54.797 --> 34:58.226
i, um, need to come
clean about something.

34:59.741 --> 35:03.244
those e-mails that you saw
on my computer from lionel...

35:04.583 --> 35:06.602
well, you weren't imagining them.

35:06.673 --> 35:07.882
so you are talking to lionel ?

35:07.917 --> 35:10.465
yeah, but not about you... about lex.

35:10.500 --> 35:14.306
lionel's been feeding me inside information
about lex's campaign for state senate.

35:14.341 --> 35:15.562
why would he do that ?

35:15.831 --> 35:18.645
maybe because he knows his
son better than any of us

35:18.711 --> 35:22.232
and the thought of what lex would do
in office scares the hell out of him.

35:22.267 --> 35:23.808
he's not the only one.

35:25.945 --> 35:29.256
look, clark, i understand
that you haven't been yourself,

35:29.714 --> 35:32.582
but you know that i would
never tell lionel your secret.

35:34.789 --> 35:36.750
i'd never tell anyone.

35:39.450 --> 35:41.693
i'd die before i'd ever betray you.

36:06.329 --> 36:07.163
hmm.

36:07.984 --> 36:11.754
those kents... they pack
quite a punch, don't they, son ?

36:15.784 --> 36:19.765
it might be wise to avoid any more press
conferences till your face has healed a bit.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.725
i wasn't planning to.

36:21.937 --> 36:23.874
not that it's any of your business.

36:24.179 --> 36:26.493
fatherly advice. i can't help it.

36:26.542 --> 36:33.223
but a front-page story that you were soundly beaten by a
jealous, young lover will hardly aid your bid for office.

36:34.421 --> 36:37.215
i have a team of
political advisors, dad.

36:37.450 --> 36:40.291
last time i checked, you
weren't on the payroll.

36:40.690 --> 36:45.915
last time i checked, lana lang had a boyfriend,
and i don't think she's in the market for a spare.

36:45.974 --> 36:47.970
i think you know the way out.

36:51.313 --> 36:54.084
this isn't about
serving the greater good.

36:54.201 --> 36:56.843
or even about power. it's about you

36:56.878 --> 37:00.041
changing the way people
perceive you, isn't it ?

37:02.565 --> 37:04.244
that's why you're running for office.

37:04.280 --> 37:08.577
even if you were president of the united states,
you think that's gonna make any difference ?

37:08.730 --> 37:14.077
because the people who are close to you
will always know what is truly in your heart.

37:17.270 --> 37:20.194
that's why lana lang
will never love you, son.

37:39.062 --> 37:41.598
the thing is, i don't know
what was real and what wasn't.

37:41.633 --> 37:46.446
well, your parents loaning you to lionel luthor
for medical research... definitely not real.

37:49.311 --> 37:51.119
well, i know you'd never do that.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.658
i'm sorry.

37:52.878 --> 37:54.651
it wasn't your fault, sweetheart.

37:54.687 --> 37:57.833
i'm just glad the infection
burned itself out when it did.

37:57.974 --> 37:59.289
yeah, me too.

38:01.060 --> 38:05.322
i guess no matter how much i trust someone, i'm always
gonna have to be worried about my secret coming out.

38:07.260 --> 38:09.397
that's what i never
wanted to have happen.

38:10.488 --> 38:12.367
which is why i've...

38:13.858 --> 38:16.368
...decided not to run against lex.

38:16.744 --> 38:19.304
dad, i don't want you to put
your life on hold because of me.

38:19.327 --> 38:20.079
clark...

38:20.102 --> 38:23.754
i'm not gonna let fear
control my life or ruin yours.

38:26.064 --> 38:28.918
i want you to run against lex.
it's the right thing to do.

38:33.532 --> 38:35.152
if anything happens,

38:35.437 --> 38:38.490
we'll deal with it the same way
we always have... as a family.

38:56.723 --> 38:58.002
professor fine ?

38:59.118 --> 39:00.914
how you feeling, kal-el ?

39:01.901 --> 39:03.908
so, i didn't imagine that part.

39:04.613 --> 39:05.775
no, you didn't.

39:07.241 --> 39:09.636
i thought i was the last
son of krypton, but...

39:10.059 --> 39:11.937
you people keep popping up.

39:14.131 --> 39:18.053
well, a superior civilization
is difficult to eradicate.

39:22.078 --> 39:23.076
why are you here ?

39:23.123 --> 39:24.661
to stop what's coming.

39:25.412 --> 39:26.845
and to help you

39:26.962 --> 39:29.428
walk the path of a true kryptonian.

39:30.859 --> 39:32.737
so i can be superior ?

39:33.101 --> 39:34.416
no, thanks.

39:37.481 --> 39:41.502
why do you continue to trust
humans more than your own people ?

39:45.498 --> 39:47.682
i'm just going off what i've seen.

39:47.835 --> 39:49.761
maybe you need to look closer.

39:52.530 --> 39:54.878
why didn't you just tell
me who you really were

39:54.913 --> 39:57.849
instead of posing as my
professor this whole time ?

39:58.436 --> 40:02.791
why do you keep your identity a
secret, even from the woman you love ?

40:07.734 --> 40:10.963
you've been on this
planet many years, kal-el.

40:11.479 --> 40:16.539
i had to observe you before revealing myself to
determine just how much you've been influenced by these...

40:16.751 --> 40:17.678
humans.

40:19.557 --> 40:21.788
you say "human" like it's a bad thing.

40:22.633 --> 40:25.011
just going on what i've seen.

40:27.078 --> 40:29.520
this race shows promise.

40:31.223 --> 40:35.215
but at this point in history, they're
still duplicitous by their very nature.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.673
even the ones you think
you love can't be trusted.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.257
you don't know anything about this race.

40:42.419 --> 40:43.957
yeah, they can be petty

40:44.075 --> 40:46.902
and dishonest and betray
each other over nothing.

40:47.842 --> 40:49.615
but they can also be honest

40:49.685 --> 40:50.754
and loyal.

40:51.358 --> 40:54.211
and they would give up everything
to protect someone they love.

40:55.633 --> 40:57.806
even if they were from another planet.

40:58.404 --> 40:59.449
kal-el...

41:00.776 --> 41:02.303
my name is clark.

41:04.393 --> 41:07.079
and i'll always believe in
my friends and my family.

41:11.659 --> 41:15.096
i sincerely hope your
trust hasn't been misplaced.

41:21.002 --> 41:22.341
you know where to find me

41:23.210 --> 41:25.243
when you're ready to accept the truth.

42:07.336 --> 42:12.279
