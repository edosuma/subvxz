13:45.370 --> 13:47.140
Yeah, what's up?

13:48.180 --> 13:49.610
Um, Will, we're sitting over here.

13:49.780 --> 13:53.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, there you go
trying to tell me where to sit.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.910
Look here. I sit when and where I please.
You know what I'm saying?

13:57.090 --> 14:01.020
Because I'm the man. I'm the man.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.450
You give me one good reason
why I should sit over there.

14:04.790 --> 14:06.920
Because your name is on the seat.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.260
I knew that.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.530
And you know how I knew that?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.930
- Because you're the man.
- Because you're the man.

14:18.610 --> 14:21.170
- You see what I'm saying? They recognize.
- Tsk.

14:22.180 --> 14:25.080
- Hello. Welcome.
WILL: Yeah, whatever.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.340
Well, tonight we're here to benefit
from each other's experiences.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.250
Those of who are just starting out...

14:30.420 --> 14:33.220
...and others who have had long
and nurturing relationships.

14:33.390 --> 14:34.790
GEORGE:
Get the lead out, Weezy.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.320
LOUISE:
I'm walking as fast as I can, George.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.540
Hello, Louise, George.

14:49.710 --> 14:51.260
Hey, Whitey.

14:53.940 --> 14:56.070
That's, uh... That's Dr. Whitehorn.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.710
Yeah, yeah, Horny.
Where do you want me to sit?

14:59.680 --> 15:04.240
Never mind. I'll sit wherever I want,
because I'm the man. I'm the man.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.120
Tonight, why don't we begin
with a simple exercise?

15:07.290 --> 15:10.590
I'd like each one of you to say three things
that you like about your partner, okay?

15:10.760 --> 15:13.160
Uh, George, why don't you start?

15:23.970 --> 15:25.870
Well?

15:26.040 --> 15:27.530
Well, what?

15:27.710 --> 15:29.800
The man said to name three things...

15:29.980 --> 15:31.910
...you like about me.
- Fine.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.480
Your mother died. Your mother is dead.
Your mother ain't living no more.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.010
[LAUGHING]

15:47.700 --> 15:49.530
[COUGHING]

15:51.000 --> 15:54.660
- Okay, let's try role reversal.
- No, unh-unh.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.670
It'll give you insight
into how your partner perceives you.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.400
Now, who'd like to go first?

16:00.580 --> 16:04.270
- Oh, I'd like to.
- Oh, great, Lisa. Show us Will.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.950
[IMITATING WILL]
Who the man?

16:18.130 --> 16:20.150
I'm the man.

16:20.330 --> 16:24.130
<i>Because I ain't spending
no 4.95 on some stank skeezer...</i>

16:24.300 --> 16:26.560
...to take her to the salad bar.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.940
If a honey wants to go with me
to the Sizzler...

16:30.110 --> 16:33.170
...she gots to be all that.
She gots to look good.

16:33.340 --> 16:37.070
Yeah. You know.

16:37.250 --> 16:41.180
Because I'm the man.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.120
Nicely done.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.090
I believe it's my turn.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.390
Go ahead, Will.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.890
Um... Oh, excuse... Um...

16:56.060 --> 17:00.470
- Can I borrow this for a second? Thank you.
GEORGE: Hey! Man.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.270
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.339
[IMITATING LISA]
Tsk.

17:15.079 --> 17:19.319
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.720
You want some popcorn?

17:22.990 --> 17:25.050
Tsk. Why you screaming?

17:25.230 --> 17:27.250
What, I'm supposed to be a cook,
a cleaner...

17:27.430 --> 17:30.260
...do everything you want.
What you gonna do? Tsk.

17:31.870 --> 17:35.030
Tsk. Tsk.
Look, you need to stop acting so stupid.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.400
You need to get a job, do something
so you can buy me something nice.

17:38.570 --> 17:41.570
You never bought me nothing nice.
You just be acting all dumb.

17:41.740 --> 17:45.940
Why you talking about your uncle all
the time? He ain't fat. He is big-boned.

17:48.180 --> 17:51.050
And I thought I had it bad. Ha-ha-ha.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.250
- And it's about to get worse.
- Ow!

17:55.420 --> 17:59.260
Hey, hey, hey. Now, none of that.
If you can't verbalize your aggressions...

17:59.430 --> 18:03.630
...then here, try a bataka.
GEORGE: Oh.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.930
- And this is for Mama.
- Hey!

18:08.100 --> 18:10.130
And this is for calling me Weezy...

18:10.310 --> 18:13.900
...when you know I'm sensitive
about my asthma.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.700
Try this on your asthma.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.170
Hey, hey, hey, time out! Time out now!
Stop it!

18:19.350 --> 18:22.780
Look it, why don't we all
just take a five-minute break, okay?

18:31.490 --> 18:33.960
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Fine.

18:34.130 --> 18:39.090
- Man, she always been like that? Ha-ha-ha.
- No, she used to be mean. Ha-ha-ha.

18:40.740 --> 18:43.530
We tied the knot 40 years ago
and I've been swinging from it ever since.

18:43.710 --> 18:44.930
[BOTH LAUGH]

18:45.110 --> 18:47.580
Yeah, I hear you.
Sure, there's women like that...

18:47.740 --> 18:49.440
...make you realize
why God made darkness.

18:49.610 --> 18:50.640
[GEORGE LAUGHS]

18:50.810 --> 18:52.640
- Hey, man!
- What?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.410
- You insulting my wife?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:56.590 --> 18:59.320
Hold up a second there, cul-de-sac.

19:00.590 --> 19:03.060
Look, I am twice your size...

19:03.230 --> 19:05.850
...and half your age.
You need to chill out a little bit.

19:06.030 --> 19:07.500
Your mama.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.400
Oh, no.
You didn't just talk about my mother.

19:12.570 --> 19:15.370
Okay. Well, I'll talk about
your daddy instead.

19:15.540 --> 19:18.060
Your daddy is so fat
that when he went to school...

19:18.240 --> 19:20.570
...he sat next to everybody.

19:25.510 --> 19:28.710
But still he wasn't as fat
as your fat mama. Ha, ha.

19:33.790 --> 19:35.810
Oh! Come on with it!

19:35.990 --> 19:38.520
Stop it! Stop it right now!
You're not supposed to...

19:38.690 --> 19:40.990
Stop it now!
Stop it or I'll charge you double.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.100
GEORGE: What?
WILL: Who you talking to?

19:43.630 --> 19:47.090
- Oh, that is so juvenile.
- I know it.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.670
I have never seen anything so stupid.

19:51.810 --> 19:54.900
You calling my husband stupid?

19:55.180 --> 20:01.640
Honey, the only thing stupid here
is your big-eared boyfriend.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.850
He looks like a car coming down the road
with both doors open.

20:12.360 --> 20:18.730
- Oh, no, Miss Thing. It's on now.
- All right, sister, bring it on.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.000
WHITEHORN: Hey! Come on,
you're missing the whole point here.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.540
Stop it! Stop it right now!

20:23.710 --> 20:26.170
You're supposed to verbalize,
not beat each other up!

20:26.340 --> 20:30.510
- You might as well be taking karate.
LOUISE: Coward!

20:35.050 --> 20:36.540
[SIGHS]

20:36.790 --> 20:38.810
Hey, what's up, Uncle Phil?

20:39.190 --> 20:43.060
- What in the world happened?
- We got into a huge fight.

20:43.230 --> 20:44.250
A fistfight?

20:44.630 --> 20:46.750
No, we used bats.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.090
On each other?

20:49.260 --> 20:51.960
Oh, no, no. We beat up this old couple.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.900
Yeah, but they had it coming, right, baby?

20:55.070 --> 20:56.700
- Yeah, baby.
- That's what I'm saying.

20:56.870 --> 21:00.000
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I mean, that's terrible.

21:00.180 --> 21:02.770
Oh, no, no, no.
This was at therapy, Uncle Phil.

21:02.940 --> 21:05.170
Hey, you know,
it actually helped us out a lot.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.840
We decided we're not gonna get married
in September.

21:08.020 --> 21:09.850
Ooh. Okay, if that's your decision.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.250
Yeah. We're gonna move
the wedding up to May.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.450
I mean, we saw tonight
that we got our little petty differences...

21:17.630 --> 21:19.960
...but when push come to shove,
we've got each other's back.

21:20.130 --> 21:23.290
Ha, ha. I'm glad you're getting along.
That's still no reason...

21:23.470 --> 21:27.530
...to move up your wedding.
- Well, you know, that's not the only reason.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.600
We wanna miss the rainy season
in the motherland.

21:30.770 --> 21:34.170
That's where you're sending us
for our honeymoon. Heh. Oh.

21:37.210 --> 21:41.550
That's from the travel agent. She says
she could retire on this one. Ha-ha-ha.

21:43.890 --> 21:45.750
Thanks.

21:49.190 --> 21:50.490
Pinch me, Geoffrey.

21:50.660 --> 21:53.250
Not on what you're paying me.

21:54.630 --> 21:57.290
But for 35,000, I'll slap you silly.
