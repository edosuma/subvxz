WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.869
JEAN: Hey, Lindsay,
how'd you like

00:02.903 --> 00:05.438
to go buy
some new clothes
at the mall?

00:05.471 --> 00:07.641
Those old
jeans are looking
pretty ragged.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.309
No, thanks, mom.
I like my jeans.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.344
Dad's the one
who could
use some pants.

00:11.377 --> 00:13.213
Who am I trying
to impress?

00:13.246 --> 00:16.049
When it's your house,
you can wear
a tuxedo to breakfast.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.884
Honey, I called
Mrs. Amendella.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.419
She's gonna stay
with you kids

00:19.452 --> 00:21.522
while Daddy and I
are in Chicago.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.157
Mom, no.
We don't need
a babysitter.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.225
I can take
care of Sam.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.260
I can take care of myself.

00:27.293 --> 00:28.729
Oh, yeah,
that's a great idea.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.832
I can just see you guys
eating candy for breakfast

00:31.865 --> 00:33.834
and drawing pictures
on the walls.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.570
How old do you think
we are, Dad?

00:36.603 --> 00:39.339
I've been baby‐sitting
for the Kellers
for two years already.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.074
Yeah, but that's
for their kids.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.676
MOM: Well, I don't know.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.112
Maybe they are
a little old
for a babysitter.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.114
Maybe they're
ready, honey.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.517
Well, fine.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.854
Mrs. Amendella makes
the house smell like
an old lady anyway.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.356
(LAUGHS) I hear
Peter Lemengello

00:56.389 --> 00:58.559
is playing
the closing
night gala.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.860
Mm‐mmm, Paul Anka.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.696
Ooh, Paul Anka.
Can I come?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.698
Yeah, I guess
you'd prefer
if we'd listen

01:04.731 --> 01:07.367
to that punk rock music
I've been reading about.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.704
You know those Sex Pistols?
They spit on their audience.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.272
Ah, that's
terrible.

01:12.305 --> 01:13.607
Yep, that's what
I want to do.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.009
Spend my hard‐earned money
to be spit on.

01:16.042 --> 01:17.477
Now that's entertainment.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.279
Oh, come on, Dad.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.413
Every generation
is afraid

01:20.446 --> 01:22.949
Of the music that
comes from the next.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.318
Well, I'm sure
your parents hated Elvis.

01:25.351 --> 01:27.821
Elvis didn't expectorate
on his fans.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.990
No, but he died
on the toilet.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.625
Well, that's
paradise compared

01:31.658 --> 01:33.794
to where those Sex Pistols
are gonna end up.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.434
Hey, Lindsay.
Hey.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.106
Hey, Nick.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.308
Oh, hey. What's up?

02:55.341 --> 02:56.610
What's the matter?

02:56.643 --> 03:00.213
Um, John Bonham died,
you know.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.482
Yeah, I know.
Last week.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.821
He's dead. You know,
it's like, he's dead.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.489
And as a result,

03:09.523 --> 03:12.793
there's no more
Led Zeppelin.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.195
Well, why don't they just
get a new drummer?

03:15.228 --> 03:16.462
What, are you...?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.301
Let's just forget it.

03:25.338 --> 03:28.208
No. What you got
to do is look for
something in the store

03:28.241 --> 03:30.243
that's expensive but
looks really cheap.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.545
And then you
switch price tags

03:31.578 --> 03:33.313
with something that
is really cheap.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.215
Then you gotta put
the original back on it

03:35.248 --> 03:36.550
and return it
for store credit.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.051
That's how I got
this jacket.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.554
10 bucks this
thing cost me.

03:40.587 --> 03:44.190
Oh, it's beautiful.
Clearly worth
all the effort.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.391
(CHUCKLES)

03:45.425 --> 03:47.360
My dad caught
a shoplifter once.

03:47.393 --> 03:50.430
And he had to lock
him in the store,
and then the cops came.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.803
Well, my dad
says shoplifters
cost him a fortune.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.072
Hey, if I owned
your store,

03:59.105 --> 04:01.407
I caught some
little kid shoplifting,

04:01.441 --> 04:03.276
I'd just take him
out back,

04:04.911 --> 04:06.279
and I'd deal with it.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.915
Oh, would you,
Mr. Tough Man?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.617
Yeah, I would,
Mrs. Tough Man.

04:10.651 --> 04:14.254
(LAUGHS) Oh, like that
time when John Ergner
kicked your ass?

04:14.287 --> 04:15.556
Like‐‐Like that?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.190
Do you mind
flapping your lips
somewhere else?

04:17.223 --> 04:18.458
You smell.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.393
Hey, what,
did you guys break
up or something?

04:20.426 --> 04:25.098
No, we didn't break up.
I dumped his loser ass.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.301
Oh, is that
what happened?

04:28.334 --> 04:32.038
Ok, if it makes you
feel better.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.740
(MUMBLING)
Do you guys wanna‐‐

04:33.774 --> 04:35.776
Hey, does anybody
want to come see
The Wall with me

04:35.809 --> 04:36.643
on Saturday night?

04:36.677 --> 04:38.579
Thought I might try
an experiment,

04:38.612 --> 04:40.747
see it straight once.
I don't know.

04:40.781 --> 04:45.819
Don't do it.
You'll regret it,
man. Trust me.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.054
Well, I would,
but my parents
are going out of town,

04:48.088 --> 04:49.856
and I have to watch
my little brother.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.828
Uh, maybe we could all
hang out at your house.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.797
(LIGHT VOICE)
Kegger.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.633
Kegger,
(FAKES COUGH)
kegger.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.001
(KIM LAUGHS)

05:01.034 --> 05:02.302
You mean
like a party?

05:02.869 --> 05:04.337
Yeah, right.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.206
Lindsay's too lame
to let anyone enter

05:06.239 --> 05:08.074
her precious
little house.

05:14.180 --> 05:17.117
Sure. Why not?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.686
(LAUGHS)
I like parties.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.024
Great. Who's
the too‐lame one?

05:24.057 --> 05:26.560
(SIGH) up yours.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.863
Bye.

05:29.896 --> 05:33.033
Ok, guys,
10 bucks each
for the keg.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.435
Come on. You, too.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.303
No, Lindsay,
Lindsay, please.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.839
House drinks free.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.011
Why does she hang out
with those guys?

05:45.846 --> 05:46.813
I don't know.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.149
Why don't you go over
there and ask her?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.084
They're gonna
ruin her life.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.485
If you don't care
about high school,

05:52.519 --> 05:54.320
then you won't get
into a good college,

05:54.354 --> 05:55.589
then you'll have
no future,

05:55.622 --> 05:57.457
and you'll wind up
dead or in jail.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.325
Really?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.628
Were you asleep during
Scared Straight?

06:04.464 --> 06:05.766
You're in love
with Lindsay.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.469
Ack, I am not.
What are you
talking about?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.071
Why are you
getting so mad?

06:11.104 --> 06:13.674
I'm not!
Why would
you say that?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.942
Because you have
your book in
front of your pants.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.612
Oh, shut up. Jerk.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.881
I'm not in love with her.
I just care about her

06:20.914 --> 06:23.584
Because she's
my good
friend's sister.

06:23.617 --> 06:26.486
Maybe you should
ask yourself
why you don't care.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.422
I ca‐‐come on,
you know I care.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.759
Sam.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.163
Hey, Sam,
I'm having a keg
party tomorrow night.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.231
You are?

06:38.264 --> 06:39.600
Yeah, so you can't
tell mom and dad.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.304
Well, what if your friends
trash our house?

06:44.337 --> 06:46.172
My friends aren't gonna
trash the house.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.408
I'll have plenty of time
to clean up before
mom and dad get back.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.343
Mmm, what if dad
finds out?

06:50.376 --> 06:52.879
Well, that's my problem.
Don't worry about it.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.248
No, no, it's not,
because dad
will yell at me

06:55.281 --> 06:56.416
for not telling on you.

06:56.449 --> 06:57.718
Are you gonna tell on me?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.356
I guess not.
I'm just...

07:03.389 --> 07:05.992
Thanks, Sam.
See you later.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.832
Give me your keys, man.
You're drunk.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.835
I'm not drunk. Get out
of my way, I'm fine.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.571
No, you're not,
and I'm not going
to drive with you.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.173
I don't care.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.441
If you try
to drive like that,

07:21.474 --> 07:23.544
I'm gonna call
the police.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.445
I thought you
were my friend.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.848
He is your
friend, daisy.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.449
Who are you?

07:29.482 --> 07:31.417
I'm the
designated driver.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.554
I made a pledge not to
drink at this party

07:33.587 --> 07:36.089
So I can help
people like you
get home safely.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.059
MILLIE: That's cool.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.561
I should have
done that.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.663
Designated driver's
pretty hot.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.698
Like to get her drunk.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.233
If you drive right now,

07:47.267 --> 07:49.169
You're not only a danger
to yourself,

07:49.202 --> 07:52.172
but you're a danger
to everyone else
on the road.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.308
You're like a loaded gun.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.378
(SOBS) I didn't want
to hurt anyone.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.180
(LAUGHS)

08:00.213 --> 08:02.949
What do you say?
Will you give me
your keys?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.620
And freeze!

08:06.653 --> 08:09.255
Let's hear it for the sober
students improv players.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.991
(APPLAUSE)

08:13.794 --> 08:17.497
That was a good example of
how to prevent a tragedy.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.066
But there's an even better
way to save lives,

08:20.100 --> 08:21.167
And that's not to drink...

08:21.201 --> 08:23.136
Ken's got
the right idea.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.304
MR. ROSSO:
...in the first place.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.607
And, hey, just
'cause your parents

08:26.640 --> 08:29.375
or other adults drink
doesn't mean you have to.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.545
Now, I know what
you're thinking:

08:31.578 --> 08:34.948
"Mr. Rosso, you
don't understand.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.951
If I don't drink,
I won't be cool."

08:38.785 --> 08:40.721
Well, you know
what I say to that?

08:40.754 --> 08:45.526
Maybe if you don't drink,
you will be cool.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.595
And right now
our thespians,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.597
Millie, Cindy,
and Harris,

08:50.631 --> 08:55.201
will show you
how you can stay
sober and still be cool.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.837
Ok, what I need
from you people

08:56.870 --> 08:59.439
is a kind of party where
drinking might occur.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.907
A kind of party.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.075
A sex party.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.810
(LAUGHTER)

09:03.844 --> 09:07.648
All right, I think
I heard someone say
"birthday party."

09:07.681 --> 09:12.619
Um, ok,
you're at a birthday
party and... Go.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.256
Hey, Mary,
happy birthday.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.025
Oh, thank you,
Bob.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.160
How's it going?

09:20.193 --> 09:23.664
Good. You did
a really nice job
decorating here.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.966
You know
if anyone here
has any cocaine?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.534
(LAUGHTER)

09:27.568 --> 09:30.604
No. Coke does damage
to your brain.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.607
I think I can have coke
whenever I want,

09:33.640 --> 09:37.711
But I can only
watch you open
your presents now.

09:37.744 --> 09:42.015
Oh, thank you, Bob.
That's very sweet.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.249
I knew you'd like...

09:43.283 --> 09:44.785
Wanna get out of here?

09:46.386 --> 09:48.589
Sure.

09:48.622 --> 09:53.594
Ok. I'm gonna go.
Count to 10, then come.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.262
HARRIS: This is
the best birthday ever.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.931
Ok, let's have cake.

09:57.964 --> 10:01.902
MILLIE: Ok. Come on,
let's go get a glass of pop.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.005
HARRIS: I hope
they have orange.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.008
Hey, it's a party,
isn't it?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.544
And freeze.

10:10.577 --> 10:14.047
As you can see,
nothing is
more contagious

10:14.080 --> 10:15.782
than good judgment.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.752
Thanks, gang.
Jimmy, lights.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.958
But if you still
think drinking is cool,

10:27.628 --> 10:31.197
why not ask Jenny Powell
if drinking is cool.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.133
Well, you can't ask her.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.502
She crashed into
a phone pole this winter

10:35.536 --> 10:37.838
driving drunk after
a new year's party.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.877
And you can't ask
John Yablonski either.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.213
He died from alcohol poisoning
at a fraternity party.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.183
I love being told
not to drink

10:50.216 --> 10:52.252
by a pothead hippie
guidance counselor.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.855
There's probably a bar
in the teacher's lounge.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.223
Yeah, probably.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.425
Hey, Stroker.
Hey.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.661
10 bucks
for the keg.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.195
I know.
Don't weasel
out on me.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.330
I'll cut that hair off
and I'll sell it.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.468
Oh, hey, um,
I hope
you don't mind.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.505
I invited my cousin
and a couple of his
friends to the party.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.074
Oh, that's cool.
What grade are they in?

11:14.941 --> 11:17.744
No grade.
They're older.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.181
Oh. Cool.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.383
Right on.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.521
We got to do
something about
your sister's party.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.723
What's the big deal?
It's just beer.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.058
Yeah, beer at
a freak party?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.194
My cousin's friend
was at a freak
party once,

11:34.227 --> 11:36.329
and someone
put angel dust
in her drink.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.831
Oh, man.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.901
We gotta go.
To protect Lindsay.

11:41.768 --> 11:45.672
Oh, I can't.
Um, Dallas is on.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.074
What? Bill,
Dallas sucks.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.210
You suck.
Dallas rules.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.045
Face it,
you're just gonna
let Lindsay end up

11:52.078 --> 11:54.047
Like one of
those pictures.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.417
Fine, I'll go.
But I'm watching
Dallas there.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.286
(GIRLS LAUGH)

12:00.320 --> 12:04.057
I was just joking.
I don't‐‐
I don't watch <i>Dallas.</i>

12:06.727 --> 12:08.762
The hot water heater
makes that funny noise,

12:08.795 --> 12:10.163
call the gas company.

12:10.196 --> 12:12.265
I don't want to come home
to a couple of dead kids.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.601
There's 50 bucks on
the dining room table.

12:14.635 --> 12:15.736
That should be enough.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.137
Lindsay, you're
in charge of it.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.471
Ok.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.473
It's not for those
Star Wars cards
or those goofy packs.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.575
Wacky packs.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.743
Ah, whatever.
Don't blow it.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.344
JEAN: Hey, Lindsay,
come here, sweetie.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.879
Yeah?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.749
Okay, now, this is
dinner for Friday night.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.785
This is lunch and
dinner for Saturday.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.153
If you need
anything else,

12:33.186 --> 12:36.222
Daddy left $50
on the dining
room table, ok?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.457
HAROLD: Ok, let's go.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.526
I want to get there
before the welcome mixer.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.695
All right, and turn
out the lights
when you go out.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.163
I'm not made
of money.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.031
Wait.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.834
HAROLD:
What is it?

12:53.707 --> 12:55.275
Have a good trip.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.843
Oh.
Thanks.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.011
We'll be back
Sunday night.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.279
Don't do
anything stupid.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.847
(LAUGHS)
I love you.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.716
Bye‐bye.
Have fun, guys.

13:02.749 --> 13:03.884
Bye.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.418
Bye.
Love you.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.425
All right.

13:17.731 --> 13:20.166
Um, at assembly today,

13:20.200 --> 13:23.469
they did these improvisations
about drinking and driving.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.138
It's pretty funny.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.073
Yeah, I saw.
That's why I left.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.410
Well, at assembly today,

13:30.443 --> 13:32.879
they showed these
pictures of these kids

13:32.913 --> 13:35.649
who died in
drunk driving accidents.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.851
Did you know
any of them?
No.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.454
Well, one of their
moms talked.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.557
She was pretty sad.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.793
It kind of freaked
everybody out.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.361
Oh, and at
assembly today,

13:48.394 --> 13:50.964
it said that if you drink
too much in one night

13:50.997 --> 13:52.699
you can die of
alcohol poisoning.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.868
Sam, you
sound like dad.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.138
I just don't know why

13:58.171 --> 14:00.106
you have to have beer
at your party, that's all.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.441
I mean,
you've never had beer

14:01.474 --> 14:03.343
at any of your other parties
and they were fun.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.212
Well, those were
birthday parties, Sam.
We went bowling.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.551
Yeah, well,
remember the party
where you had a magician?

14:10.584 --> 14:11.852
That was fun.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.186
Why don't you
have a magician?

14:13.219 --> 14:16.657
We are not having a magi‐‐
Why am I talking to you?

14:16.690 --> 14:19.025
I'm in charge.
Leave me alone.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.861
Leave me alone.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.632
If "f" is a differentiable
function of "x,"

14:25.666 --> 14:28.168
And "c" is a real
number, then...

14:32.673 --> 14:34.240
(WHISPERS) Party.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.077
(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

14:38.111 --> 14:39.479
Can I help
you, miss?

14:39.513 --> 14:40.446
Yeah, there's, um,

14:40.480 --> 14:43.383
an emergency phone call
for Lindsay Weir.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.585
It's her mom.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.521
Oh, ok. Lindsay.
Go ahead.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.591
Come on, let's go.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.629
Ok, people, back on me.
Come on. The show's over.

14:57.631 --> 14:58.899
Did they say
what's wrong?

14:58.932 --> 15:00.366
They didn't
tell me anything.

15:02.503 --> 15:03.537
Hey, Lindsay.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.238
Not now, there's
some emergency
with my parents.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.808
No, no, Lindsay.
Lindsay, no, no, no.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.142
I know. They want‐‐

15:09.175 --> 15:11.377
They want you to come
with them to buy a keg.

15:11.878 --> 15:12.913
What?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.114
Hey, thanks
a lot, Sara.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.749
No problem.
See you at
the party tonight.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.618
All right. That's
a cute necklace.

15:18.552 --> 15:20.687
Um, we're cutting.
(LAUGHS)

15:20.721 --> 15:23.289
Daniel is paying
his brother 20 bucks

15:23.323 --> 15:24.991
and he's gonna
buy us a keg.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.227
Everybody's waiting
out at the car, so...

15:28.829 --> 15:30.030
Are you ok?

15:30.063 --> 15:33.399
Yeah, I‐‐I just...

15:33.433 --> 15:37.237
Well, it's that whole
emergency phone call thing.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.338
(SIGHS)

15:39.472 --> 15:41.107
Let's go
get some beer.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.116
Ok, I got it.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.986
Maybe you can
call your parents

15:53.019 --> 15:54.921
and tell them you fell
and hit your head

15:54.955 --> 15:56.990
and have them
come home
before the party.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.660
Then what happens
when they come home

15:59.693 --> 16:01.194
and see my
head is fine?

16:01.227 --> 16:04.397
Well, we'd have to hit
you over the head
and give you a bump.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.767
Ooh, like in that
Dirty Harry movie

16:06.800 --> 16:08.735
where the bad guy
yells at this black guy

16:08.769 --> 16:10.003
So he'll beat him up,

16:10.036 --> 16:11.872
then he blames
it on Clint.

16:11.905 --> 16:15.075
(IMITATES BAD GUY)
It was Callahan!

16:15.108 --> 16:18.512
No chance. I'm not gonna
let you guys hit me.

16:18.545 --> 16:22.082
Hey, guys, whenever
my uncle visits,

16:22.115 --> 16:23.784
my mom gives him
non‐alcoholic beer

16:23.817 --> 16:26.820
So he doesn't
get all drunk
and yell at everyone.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.154
What's non‐alcoholic beer?

16:28.188 --> 16:29.890
It's just like beer,
but it doesn't have

16:29.923 --> 16:31.992
that ingredient
that makes you drunk.

16:32.425 --> 16:33.459
Alcohol?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.328
Yeah.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.133
That's a great idea.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.803
But we're gonna
have to buy
a whole keg of it.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.571
That's gonna
be expensive.

16:44.605 --> 16:46.072
I don't have
any money.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.440
I don't, either.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.342
Yes, you do.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.713
Oh, no‐‐No way.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.014
Why not?

16:54.047 --> 16:57.117
(SIGHS) It's my
bar mitzvah money.

16:57.751 --> 16:58.919
(SIGH) I'm saving it

16:58.952 --> 17:00.420
to go backpacking
across Europe.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.422
Oh, come on,
this is important.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.390
Every time you guys
have a problem,

17:04.424 --> 17:06.326
you want to dip into
my bar mitzvah money.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.194
It's not like I get
to have another one.

17:09.563 --> 17:12.098
Come on. For Lindsay?

17:15.468 --> 17:16.503
Fine.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.641
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

17:20.674 --> 17:22.042
Oh, shut up.

17:24.845 --> 17:27.748
What if somebody
robs this place
while we're in here?

17:27.781 --> 17:31.051
People are always
getting shot
in liquor stores.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.986
Do you think
they sell
yoohoo here?

17:33.019 --> 17:34.287
I'm kinda thirsty.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.156
Yeah, Bill,
why don't you
ask the guy?

17:36.189 --> 17:38.024
Maybe he can change
your diaper, too.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.560
Hey, that
was unnecessary.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.531
We're out
of pop rocks.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.134
Uh, a keg
of beer, please.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.370
Don't see that happening.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.540
Uh, no, we'd like
non‐alcoholic beer.

17:53.974 --> 17:56.176
Oh, really? No.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.312
Please? We really need it.

18:00.614 --> 18:02.783
What for?

18:02.816 --> 18:06.119
Oh, we're gonna
switch the kegs
at his sister's party.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.293
(LAUGHS) Righteous.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.465
Bill, put your
jacket on it

18:19.499 --> 18:21.602
so if someone
drives by
they don't see it.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.470
I hope we don't
get caught.

18:24.505 --> 18:26.106
Then hurry up!

18:26.139 --> 18:28.709
(SIGH)
Bill, push!

18:28.742 --> 18:31.377
I‐‐I am!
I am!

18:47.093 --> 18:49.830
She's in there.
How are we
gonna do this?

18:49.863 --> 18:53.333
I'll distract her
while you and Bill
switch the kegs.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.569
I'm tired
of carrying
this stupid keg.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.003
Why don't
you let me
distract her?

18:57.037 --> 18:58.672
I'm distracting her.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.473
Come on.
Hurry up.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.575
I'm going in.

Hey, Lindsay.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.386
What are you
doing here?

19:15.021 --> 19:17.791
Sam, Bill and I
are just hanging out.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.795
Oh, please,
allow me.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.237
Thanks.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.374
(WHISPERS)
Come on, push.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.777
I am pushing.
It's heavy.

19:38.078 --> 19:39.846
Careful. My foot!

19:39.880 --> 19:43.183
Hey, it's your foot.
You can watch it,
too, you know.

19:43.216 --> 19:46.787
So, what kind of music
are you gonna play tonight?

19:46.820 --> 19:48.421
You should play
some Chicago.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.323
They've got a really hot
horn section.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.793
Ha, I don't know.

19:52.826 --> 19:53.827
I think I'm gonna play

19:53.860 --> 19:58.298
some Zeppelin, Foghat,
hmm, maybe some Sabbath.

19:58.832 --> 19:59.733
Friday night,

19:59.766 --> 20:02.402
always a good night
for some Sabbath.

20:03.637 --> 20:07.574
'Cause you know,
Friday is the Sabbath...

20:08.875 --> 20:09.876

20:16.883 --> 20:18.351
Think Neal's ok
in there?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.786
He's having
a terrific time.

20:19.820 --> 20:20.654
Why?

20:20.687 --> 20:22.088
He's in love
with your sister.

20:22.122 --> 20:23.323
What?
Ow!

20:24.424 --> 20:26.326
Hey, Sam,
what was that?

20:26.359 --> 20:29.362
Uh, nothing.
Bill fell.

20:33.934 --> 20:35.636
Hey, don't you want to go
play with those guys?

20:37.137 --> 20:39.806
No. I like talking to you.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.180
If Neal marries
your sister,

20:47.213 --> 20:49.449
then he'd be your
brother‐in‐law.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.185
Then‐‐Then,
if you had kids,

20:52.218 --> 20:55.055
uh, Neal would be
their Uncle Neal.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.258
And then I bet
Lindsay's kids
would look like Neal.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.695
Bill, shut up.

33:42.623 --> 33:44.625
Yeah. Neal
invited me.

33:44.658 --> 33:47.027
Oh, this is
my cousin Beth.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.795
She's visiting
from Boca Raton.

33:48.829 --> 33:50.697
Oh, hi.
So where's the beer?

33:50.731 --> 33:53.466
Uh, it‐
It's over there.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.637
Don't worry.
I'm the
designated driver.

34:01.775 --> 34:03.777
Good God.

34:03.810 --> 34:05.478
Why did Neal
invite her?

34:05.512 --> 34:07.948
Now she's gonna
see all the dumb
stuff in my house.

34:07.981 --> 34:10.083
His plan is
to distract you,

34:10.116 --> 34:12.018
so he can hit
on your sister.

34:12.052 --> 34:14.287
Oh, man!
He's so dead.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.822
What am I gonna
say to Cindy?

34:15.856 --> 34:18.959
Don't say anything.
Be dominant.

34:18.992 --> 34:22.095
It's all‐‐
All about dominance.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.364
I saw this monkey
show on PBS.

34:25.566 --> 34:28.501
If you talk to her first,
it's a sign of weakness.

34:28.535 --> 34:31.905
And she will
not pick you
to be her mate.

34:31.938 --> 34:33.239
Are you drunk?

34:33.273 --> 34:34.841
I think so.
Yes, I am.

34:34.875 --> 34:37.844
Oh, man!
Go into my room,
lock the door,

34:37.878 --> 34:39.513
And don't drink
any more.

34:39.546 --> 34:41.247
That's very dominant.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.920
Have you guys
seen Daniel?

34:46.953 --> 34:48.855
No.
No.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.267
Thanks for
the dance.

35:09.442 --> 35:11.878
KIM: Ow. Watch it, Romeo.
You're on my hair.

35:11.912 --> 35:14.147
Hey, we're busy here.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.549
Uh, sorry.

35:16.650 --> 35:17.851
Oh, hey, Lindsay.

35:18.619 --> 35:19.786
(KIM LAUGHS)

35:19.820 --> 35:22.789
Don't worry.
We threw your teddy
bears on the floor.

36:08.501 --> 36:11.304
Daniel and Kim are
making out on my bed.

36:13.106 --> 36:15.576
Oh.
I thought
they broke up.

36:15.609 --> 36:18.344
Yeah. I don't know.
They break up, like,

36:18.378 --> 36:20.714
every week,
you know, so...

36:22.816 --> 36:25.318
Hey. Hey...

36:25.351 --> 36:27.921
You don't look like you're
having very much fun.

36:27.954 --> 36:29.556
Well, I'm not.

36:30.724 --> 36:31.758
Hey, Lindsay,

36:32.726 --> 36:34.528
this is a party.

36:34.561 --> 36:38.298
Ok? So will you please just,
like, try to relax

36:38.331 --> 36:41.768
and have
a good time, ok?

36:41.802 --> 36:42.836
And when it's over,

36:42.869 --> 36:44.270
I'll stay and help
you clean up.

36:44.738 --> 36:46.272
Thanks.

36:46.306 --> 36:48.575
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

36:49.610 --> 36:50.811
Yeah, me, too.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.016
(LAUGHS)
what are you doing?

36:56.049 --> 36:57.317
Nothing.

36:58.251 --> 36:59.653
Ew! Stop!

37:01.187 --> 37:02.723
What are you doing?!

37:02.756 --> 37:05.792
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God,
I'm really sorry.

37:05.826 --> 37:07.360
I'm really sorry.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.762
What are you doing?!

37:08.795 --> 37:10.130
I'm really sorry.

37:10.163 --> 37:12.999
I'm‐‐I'm really wasted
right now, you know.

37:14.334 --> 37:15.869
John Bonham died.

37:36.823 --> 37:38.992
Lindsay? Are you ok?

37:39.926 --> 37:41.227
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.663
I'll be out in a minute.

37:44.130 --> 37:46.299
Sometimes it helps
to talk to someone.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.468
Well, I'm too drunk
to talk.

37:48.501 --> 37:52.105
No, that's ok.
I speak drunk.

37:52.138 --> 37:56.042
I'm so wasted,
and I hate my life.

37:57.043 --> 37:58.745
You shouldn't hate
your life.

37:59.245 --> 38:00.881
Why not? It sucks.

38:01.682 --> 38:03.083
No, it doesn't.

38:03.116 --> 38:05.285
You're a beautiful
young girl.

38:05.318 --> 38:07.287
The world
is your oyster.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.455
Please, leave me alone.

38:09.923 --> 38:10.957
No.

38:10.991 --> 38:12.325
Why?

38:15.562 --> 38:17.531
Because you're
Sam's sister.

38:20.867 --> 38:22.636
I'm so wasted.

38:23.403 --> 38:26.006
I wish I never
had this party.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.210
Uh, that's
all right.
It's ok.

38:30.243 --> 38:31.812
Everything
will be ok.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.787
Sam, right?

38:40.821 --> 38:44.424
Have you, uh, seen
your sister
around anywhere?

38:44.457 --> 38:46.827
Uh, no.
Not recently.

38:49.095 --> 38:51.665
Um, if you see her,

38:51.698 --> 38:53.534
could you just tell her
I'm really sorry?

38:53.567 --> 38:55.101
Did you break something?

38:56.570 --> 38:57.638
No.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.474
Just forget it, ok?

39:02.509 --> 39:05.011
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

39:05.045 --> 39:06.146
(GLASS BREAKS)

39:06.179 --> 39:08.615
Oh, God. What is
going on out there?

39:08.649 --> 39:10.483
I didn't even want
to have this party.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.452
I only had it 'cause
Daniel wanted it.

39:12.485 --> 39:13.587
And next thing I know,

39:13.620 --> 39:15.756
he's making out
on my bed with Kim.

39:15.789 --> 39:17.057
It's typical.

39:18.959 --> 39:21.261
All my new friends
think I'm some
goody two‐shoes,

39:21.294 --> 39:23.830
and all my old friends
think I'm throwing
my life away.

39:23.864 --> 39:26.032
What the hell am
I supposed to do?

39:28.902 --> 39:31.271
May I speak freely?

39:31.304 --> 39:34.908
(SIGHS) That Daniel guy,
you can do better.

39:34.941 --> 39:39.445
And, hey,
at least people
showed up to your party.

39:41.081 --> 39:42.415
When I was in
the sixth grade,

39:42.448 --> 39:44.184
my mom threw me
a surprise party,

39:44.217 --> 39:45.886
You know what
the surprise was?

39:46.386 --> 39:48.154
Nobody showed up.

39:49.189 --> 39:51.024
Except Bill and Sam.

39:52.358 --> 39:53.894
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:53.927 --> 39:55.061
Yeah?

39:55.095 --> 39:56.229
CARL: Whoever's in there,

39:56.262 --> 39:57.564
we need 5 bucks
from everyone.

39:57.598 --> 39:59.032
We're gonna get
another keg.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.535
Oh, my God.

40:01.568 --> 40:04.070
Forget it, man.
We just found 50 bucks.

40:05.038 --> 40:07.574
Um, you've gotta
do something.

40:07.608 --> 40:09.976
I can't. If I go out there
and kick everybody out,

40:10.010 --> 40:11.978
I'm gonna look so lame.

40:12.012 --> 40:14.414
No, no, no.
Why don't you call
the police?

40:14.447 --> 40:16.216
I mean, that's what
my dad always does.

40:16.249 --> 40:17.818
Pretend to be like
an angry neighbor.

40:17.851 --> 40:19.653
Oh, so they can come in
and find the keg?

40:19.686 --> 40:21.454
Not without a warrant.

40:22.022 --> 40:24.257
No. No. I can't.

40:24.290 --> 40:26.927
Oh, God. I can't handle
any of this.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.230
Of course you can.
You're Lindsay Weir.

40:30.263 --> 40:31.431
You can do anything.

40:31.464 --> 40:33.567
You're smart
and pretty.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.101
You don't take any crap.

40:35.135 --> 40:36.870
And you're
the perfect girl,

40:36.903 --> 40:39.740
And I've been in
love with you since
I was five years old.

40:39.773 --> 40:42.976
(SOBS)

40:44.745 --> 40:46.212
Maybe I should call
the cops.

40:46.246 --> 40:47.548
Yes.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.482
Ok.

40:54.287 --> 40:55.789
Hi. Police, please.

40:55.822 --> 40:56.857
Thank you.

40:58.659 --> 41:00.694
Yes, hello, police?

41:00.727 --> 41:02.896
Yes. Hi.
There's a very loud

41:02.929 --> 41:04.898
and annoying party
going on next door.

41:04.931 --> 41:06.567
It's just been
going on forever.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.669
I'm very tired,
and I'm old.
I need my rest.

41:08.702 --> 41:10.036
I gotta work tomorrow.

41:10.737 --> 41:14.007
Yes. It's 13, Nome Drive.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.611
Thank you. Please hurry up.
I'm so tired.

41:20.413 --> 41:21.982
Done.

41:22.015 --> 41:26.152
I'd say this party
has a life expectancy
of five minutes.

41:28.622 --> 41:30.056
Thanks, Neal.

41:44.571 --> 41:45.872
Hey, Sam.

41:47.373 --> 41:50.176
Oh, hey, Cindy.
I didn't see you there.

41:52.078 --> 41:53.814
So, how's it going?

41:53.847 --> 41:55.048
Pretty good.

41:56.382 --> 41:59.452
So, uh, where are
all the cute guys?

41:59.485 --> 42:04.124
Ha, what? The bus
hasn't arrived yet?

42:10.964 --> 42:13.066
Oh, my God.
The police are here.

42:13.099 --> 42:14.334
(GROANS)

42:14.367 --> 42:16.169
NEAL: Come on,
everybody out.

42:16.202 --> 42:19.005
Look, do you want Lindsay
to get in trouble?

42:19.039 --> 42:20.907
I'm on parole.

42:20.941 --> 42:23.209
Let's get out
of here before
they search the van.

42:25.746 --> 42:28.214
You don't have to run,
Ken. It's fake beer.

42:28.248 --> 42:29.415
I know.

42:29.449 --> 42:32.085
I won 87 bucks
playing quarters.

42:32.118 --> 42:33.754
This party ruled.

42:41.161 --> 42:42.395
Oh, hey, Lindsay.

42:42.428 --> 42:43.997
Great party.

42:44.030 --> 42:45.699
We had a great time.

42:46.567 --> 42:48.268
Glad you had
a good time.

42:48.301 --> 42:49.770
I knew you
had it in you.

42:52.238 --> 42:54.040
Let's get out
of here.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.410
You're a wonderful
hostess.

42:57.443 --> 42:59.045
Have us back
again soon.

43:08.354 --> 43:10.356
Should've hired
a magician.

43:11.925 --> 43:13.159
(MOANS)

43:18.599 --> 43:19.933
Hey, Bill, get up.

43:20.266 --> 43:21.501
(MOANS)

43:21.535 --> 43:24.070
That's how the drummer
from Led Zeppelin died.

43:26.472 --> 43:27.708
Did he?

43:30.410 --> 43:31.712
Goodnight, Lindsay.

43:32.312 --> 43:34.247
(MOANS)
