For all dinos.

00:25.749 --> 00:27.268
- Yeah, what's your point?

00:27.268 --> 00:29.684
- Come on, Scale, we have
the opportunity to become

00:29.684 --> 00:33.826
a bona fide Jurassic
genius, two smart dinosaurs,

00:33.826 --> 00:37.934
flying through space on
a mission for knowledge.

00:37.934 --> 00:39.453
- I'm an armadillo, Fang.

00:39.453 --> 00:43.836
- Well, yeah, but you're like
a dinosaur, a little one.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.667
Teeny tiny.

00:46.667 --> 00:47.909
- Teeny tiny!

00:47.909 --> 00:51.396
- For a dinosaur, yeah,
small yet ferocious.

00:51.396 --> 00:55.158
- So dialing back,
I'm an armadillo.

00:55.158 --> 00:59.300
- Okay, okay, you're an
armadillo but you're my partner

00:59.300 --> 01:01.751
and we're on this
adventure together.

01:01.751 --> 01:04.167
All for one and one for all.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.859
Viva la dino.

01:06.859 --> 01:10.553
- Oh boy, so we're out to
collect information and learn,

01:10.553 --> 01:11.485
right?

01:11.485 --> 01:15.730
- Yeah, fly fast and learn away.

01:15.730 --> 01:18.354
- Well then, let's
get the professor with
the most knowledge

01:18.354 --> 01:20.528
in the universe on
the monitor, stat.

01:20.528 --> 01:23.980
- Good day, you two,
how's my favorite duo?

01:23.980 --> 01:26.327
And their Jurassic juggernaut?

01:26.327 --> 01:29.330
- We're ready to get our
knowledge on, professor.

01:29.330 --> 01:30.331
- Let's get to it.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.650
Did you know that dinosaurs
are a very diverse group

01:38.650 --> 01:42.723
of reptiles who form a
family called dinosauria?

01:42.723 --> 01:45.415
[dramatic music]

01:50.800 --> 01:54.079
These beasties first appeared
during the Triassic period

01:54.079 --> 01:57.738
which took place a
really long time ago.

01:57.738 --> 02:02.639
We're talking between 231
and 243 million years.

02:04.054 --> 02:06.816
It's hard to believe
that anything is that old

02:06.816 --> 02:08.990
but science seems to prove it.

02:14.548 --> 02:17.309
The exact origin and timing
of the evolution of dinosaurs

02:17.309 --> 02:21.141
is the subject of active
research and many scientists

02:21.141 --> 02:25.352
and paleontologists still argue
about it to this very day.

02:25.352 --> 02:28.113
[dramatic music]

02:32.911 --> 02:36.190
Dinosaurs became the
dominant species of creature

02:36.190 --> 02:39.159
after the Triassic
Jurassic extinction event

02:39.159 --> 02:41.471
201 million years ago.

02:41.471 --> 02:44.060
Their dominance continued
through the Jurassic

02:44.060 --> 02:45.406
and Cretaceous periods.

02:45.406 --> 02:48.168
[dramatic music]

02:56.555 --> 02:59.075
Want to know
something super cool?

02:59.075 --> 03:02.906
Fossil records indicate that
birds we know and love today

03:02.906 --> 03:05.909
are actually modern
feathered dinosaurs,

03:05.909 --> 03:08.257
having evolved
from earlier dinos

03:08.257 --> 03:10.535
during the late Jurassic period.

03:10.535 --> 03:13.917
Crazily enough, birds
were the only dinosaurs

03:13.917 --> 03:17.404
to survive the Cretaceous
Paleogene extinction event

03:17.404 --> 03:20.510
that happened about
66 million years ago.

03:20.510 --> 03:23.375
Next time you see one of
your feathered friends,

03:23.375 --> 03:26.999
think about this, you're
looking at a real life,

03:26.999 --> 03:29.209
live dinosaur, wow!

03:30.313 --> 03:33.074
[dramatic music]

03:35.870 --> 03:38.770
[creature growls]

03:38.770 --> 03:42.291
Overall, dinosaurs come in two
different types of species,

03:42.291 --> 03:46.398
avian meaning birdlike
and non avian dinosaurs

03:46.398 --> 03:49.712
which are all dinosaurs
other than birdlike.

03:49.712 --> 03:52.680
Let's look at both
kinds and hope to learn

03:52.680 --> 03:56.443
some really neat stuff
about these massive beasts.

03:56.443 --> 03:59.100
[ominous music]

04:06.142 --> 04:10.353
Currently, there are over
10,000 living species of birds

04:10.353 --> 04:13.736
and that makes the most
diverse group of animals

04:13.736 --> 04:17.498
besides fish to still be
cruising around our planet.

04:18.534 --> 04:20.777
So how many
dinosaurs were there?

04:20.777 --> 04:23.918
That's a great question,
using fossil evidence,

04:23.918 --> 04:26.956
scientists, specifically
paleontologists,

04:26.956 --> 04:31.305
have identified over 500
distinct birdlike creatures

04:31.305 --> 04:35.758
and more than 1000 different
species of non avian dinosaur.

04:35.758 --> 04:38.416
[ominous music]

04:40.210 --> 04:43.421
Dinosaurs are represented
on every continent

04:43.421 --> 04:46.631
both by live birds
and fossil remains.

04:49.737 --> 04:52.015
- Wow, that's news to me.

04:52.015 --> 04:55.053
- See, a little more lip zip
and a little more eyes open

04:55.053 --> 04:56.261
works wonders.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.919
- How was that for brain
blasting knowledge?

04:58.919 --> 05:00.645
- Amazing.
- Dino-riffic.

05:01.991 --> 05:03.406
- I'm happy to hear.

05:03.406 --> 05:06.306
- Professor Claw, we're hungry.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.101
- Oh, your refrigerator's
empty already?

05:09.101 --> 05:14.003
- Not hungry for
food, professor, we're
drooling for details

05:14.003 --> 05:15.107
- Famished for facts.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.764
- Oh. [laughs]

05:16.764 --> 05:19.319
Well, all you had to do was ask.

05:20.216 --> 05:23.806
[creature growls]

05:23.806 --> 05:27.534
When talking about
dinosaurs, it's impossible

05:27.534 --> 05:30.537
to not mention the
biggest guy of them all,

05:30.537 --> 05:34.334
the king of all creatures,
the tyrannosaurus rex

05:34.334 --> 05:38.407
or T rex for short, let's
get to know the toughest dino

05:38.407 --> 05:42.790
to ever walk the earth who
lived about 65 to 70 million

05:43.929 --> 05:45.655
years ago in the late
Cretaceous period.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.970
[creature growls]

05:51.281 --> 05:55.631
Even its name is big,
tyrannosaurus rex translates to

05:55.631 --> 06:00.221
tyrant or king lizard and
this beast earns every bit

06:00.221 --> 06:03.777
of its name, the T rex
walks high and proud

06:03.777 --> 06:07.159
on two massive and muscular
legs and is balanced

06:07.159 --> 06:09.369
by an equally massive tail.

06:11.681 --> 06:15.271
[creature growls]

06:15.271 --> 06:19.965
The average tyrannosaurus rex
weighed seven and a half tons

06:19.965 --> 06:24.107
and stood anywhere from
10 to nearly 20 feet tall.

06:24.107 --> 06:28.042
This gigantic beast was
also about 40 foot long

06:28.042 --> 06:31.529
from head to tail, ha, that's
bigger than most houses.

06:33.358 --> 06:37.224
Even the T rex's teeth are
huge with the largest one

06:37.224 --> 06:40.814
discovered being measured
at 13 inches long.

06:40.814 --> 06:44.334
That's bigger than a
standard sized ruler, wow!

06:44.334 --> 06:47.165
[creature growls]

06:49.650 --> 06:53.620
Let's check out a
really cool dinosaur.

06:53.620 --> 06:56.899
Meet the velociraptor,
scary, right?

06:56.899 --> 07:01.179
But also pretty amazing,
let's learn why.

07:01.179 --> 07:03.768
[gentle music]

07:05.252 --> 07:09.152
Velociraptor means
swift seizer in Latin.

07:09.152 --> 07:13.329
This hungry dinosaur lived
approximately 71 to 75 million

07:13.329 --> 07:16.953
years ago during the latter
part of what was known

07:16.953 --> 07:18.368
as the Cretaceous period.

07:18.368 --> 07:20.957
[gentle music]

07:25.652 --> 07:29.759
The velociraptor which
commonly is shortened to raptor

07:29.759 --> 07:32.659
is one of the dinosaurs
most familiar to kids

07:32.659 --> 07:35.696
due to its starring role
in the Jurassic Park

07:35.696 --> 07:37.491
motion picture series.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.460
Velociraptors were
relatively small compared

07:40.460 --> 07:42.427
to other dinosaurs, that is.

07:42.427 --> 07:45.637
In fact, in real life,
velociraptors were just barely

07:45.637 --> 07:47.846
bigger than a turkey.

07:47.846 --> 07:50.228
They grew to about
six feet in length

07:50.228 --> 07:53.334
and weighed in at
about 45 pounds.

07:53.334 --> 07:56.372
That's considerably smaller
than the approximately

07:56.372 --> 08:01.308
seven foot tall, 180 pound
reptile seen in the movies.

08:01.895 --> 08:02.723
Hah, phew.

08:02.723 --> 08:05.312
[gentle music]

08:08.867 --> 08:12.492
The velociraptor was a
bipedal, feathered carnivore

08:12.492 --> 08:16.357
with a long tail and an
enlarged sickle shaped claw

08:16.357 --> 08:17.980
on each hind foot.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.086
The hind foot is their
back foot, by the way.

08:21.086 --> 08:23.572
This claw is thought to
have been used to hunt

08:23.572 --> 08:25.263
and eat their prey.

08:25.263 --> 08:27.299
The velociraptor
can be distinguished

08:27.299 --> 08:29.370
from other dinosaurs of its kind

08:29.370 --> 08:33.857
by its long and low skull
with an upturned snout.

08:33.857 --> 08:36.688
[gentle music]

08:36.688 --> 08:38.102
What's that, you ask?

08:38.102 --> 08:40.105
A feathered dinosaur?

08:40.105 --> 08:44.039
Yes, fossils found in China
tell us that the velociraptor

08:44.039 --> 08:47.803
did indeed have
feathered quill knobs.

08:47.803 --> 08:51.151
Amazing right, just like a bird.

08:51.151 --> 08:54.292
But those feathers were
not used for flight.

08:54.292 --> 08:56.708
Instead, it's believed
that the feathers

08:56.708 --> 09:00.954
were a way to maintain warmth
or maybe even were used

09:00.954 --> 09:02.162
to attract a mate.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.269
[creature growls]

09:06.269 --> 09:08.686
[acoustic music]

09:08.686 --> 09:12.310
What's that noise, a big
truck, a train racing by?

09:12.310 --> 09:15.555
In the days of the dinosaur,
that rumble you're hearing

09:15.555 --> 09:19.213
would be coming from a big
daddy in the Jurassic age

09:19.213 --> 09:21.561
known as the triceratops.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.942
Let's get to know
them a little better.

09:23.942 --> 09:26.531
[gentle music]

09:30.880 --> 09:33.365
Despite its rough
and armored exterior,

09:33.365 --> 09:36.610
the triceratops is a plant
eating tank of a creature

09:36.610 --> 09:40.027
which first appeared
about 68 million years ago

09:40.027 --> 09:42.616
in what is now known
as North America.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.239
[gentle music]

09:49.589 --> 09:52.246
The triceratops is one
of the most popular

09:52.246 --> 09:55.284
and recognizable
dinosaurs around

09:55.284 --> 09:58.977
and that has made
him a celebrity among
his fellow dinos.

09:58.977 --> 10:01.877
[creature rumbles]

10:08.608 --> 10:09.781
These wonderful animals
have been featured in films

10:11.265 --> 10:13.889
like Jurassic Park and even in
Transformers the Last Knight.

10:15.476 --> 10:18.514
[creature rumbles]

10:18.514 --> 10:21.103
[gentle music]

10:23.174 --> 10:26.349
They have appeared on
postage stamps, in cartoons,

10:26.349 --> 10:29.007
on trading cards, you name it.

10:29.007 --> 10:32.217
The state of Wyoming even
named the triceratops

10:32.217 --> 10:35.945
their state dinosaur,
what a popular dude!

10:35.945 --> 10:38.638
The line for autographs
forms to the left.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.157
[gentle music]

10:46.576 --> 10:50.477
Triceratops are like kings as
they have a large bony crown

10:50.477 --> 10:53.135
around their massive
heads and three horns

10:53.135 --> 10:55.240
to ensure it's well protected.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.657
Given the look of
its four legged body,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.969
it is commonly
compared to the modern

10:59.969 --> 11:02.385
single horned rhinoceros
that you can see

11:02.385 --> 11:05.009
at your favorite
zoos around the world

11:05.009 --> 11:08.288
or sometimes maybe even
it's compared to elephants

11:08.288 --> 11:10.842
which are commonly
believed to be good luck.

11:12.223 --> 11:14.743
The triceratops
needs its huge horns

11:14.743 --> 11:17.435
to defend itself against
other, bigger dinosaurs

11:17.435 --> 11:21.025
such as the T rex
who was also alive

11:21.025 --> 11:22.716
during that point in history.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.686
Can you imagine these two
heavyweights squaring off?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.171
What a fight.

11:29.171 --> 11:31.656
None of today's best
fighters or wrestlers

11:32.761 --> 11:34.694
would stand a chance
against either of them.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.111
[drum music]

11:49.743 --> 11:51.331
- Wow, what a trip.

11:52.573 --> 11:53.851
- Yeah, the things you
can learn at the helm

11:53.851 --> 11:55.611
of your own spaceship
with an intergalactic

11:55.611 --> 11:58.648
dinosaur teacher at your
disposal for space consultation.

11:58.648 --> 12:00.340
- I know, right?

12:00.340 --> 12:02.100
- And that's not all, Scale.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.758
Let me hit you with more facts.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.726
[creature growls]

12:06.726 --> 12:08.969
[drum music]

12:08.969 --> 12:11.316
Next up on our
prehistoric adventure,

12:11.316 --> 12:14.837
we check in with one nasty dude,

12:14.837 --> 12:18.116
the meat eating predator
known as the abelisaurus.

12:22.603 --> 12:24.744
The abelisaurus's name
roughly translates

12:24.744 --> 12:28.540
to Abel's lizard, so who
was Abel and what made him

12:28.540 --> 12:31.751
special enough to get
his very own dinosaur?

12:31.751 --> 12:35.409
Well, we're going to have
to use our heads to find out

12:35.409 --> 12:38.723
or [laughs] more
specifically, its head.

12:38.723 --> 12:41.553
[creature growls]

12:43.210 --> 12:46.213
No one has ever found
a full abelisaurus.

12:46.213 --> 12:50.286
In fact, only its head has
been discovered, that's right.

12:50.286 --> 12:51.563
Believe it or not,

12:51.563 --> 12:54.221
everything we know
about the abelisaurus

12:54.221 --> 12:56.810
we know from a single skull.

12:56.810 --> 13:01.746
Back in 1983, a man named
Roberto Abel found the skull.

13:03.127 --> 13:06.268
He was the director of the
Provincial Museum of Cipoletti

13:06.268 --> 13:10.099
in Argentina, though this
skull is far from complete,

13:10.099 --> 13:13.585
it is a general rule of thumb
that one side of a skull

13:13.585 --> 13:15.829
is pretty much the
same as the other.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.487
[creature growls]

13:18.487 --> 13:22.940
This one abelisaurus fossil
sported so many unique features

13:22.940 --> 13:26.736
that it was nominated to
anchor an entire family

13:26.736 --> 13:31.258
of dinosaurs called the
abelisauridae in 1985.

13:31.258 --> 13:33.157
[creature growls]

13:33.157 --> 13:35.953
[drum music]

13:35.953 --> 13:38.438
Scientists have noted
that the abelisaurus

13:38.438 --> 13:40.647
lived during the late
Cretaceous period

13:40.647 --> 13:43.477
approximately 85
million years ago

13:43.477 --> 13:46.411
in the area we now
know as Patagonia.

13:46.411 --> 13:48.828
[drum music]

13:50.243 --> 13:52.832
Even though its exact
size is currently unknown,

13:52.832 --> 13:55.731
it is believed that this
amazing creature was about

13:55.731 --> 13:57.319
30 feet long.

13:57.319 --> 13:59.873
[jungle music]

14:02.427 --> 14:05.948
When your parents or maybe
even your grandparents

14:05.948 --> 14:09.572
were your age, there was
an incredible TV show

14:09.572 --> 14:12.679
on the air called
the Land of the Lost

14:12.679 --> 14:15.924
and it featured a
bunch of cool dinosaurs

14:15.924 --> 14:18.374
but it is the show's
main star we're going

14:18.374 --> 14:19.893
to be talking about here.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.378
On the show they named it Alice,

14:22.378 --> 14:25.899
but we all know it as
the fearsome allosaurus.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.522
[jungle music]

14:31.008 --> 14:33.217
The allosaurus was
a large dinosaur

14:33.217 --> 14:38.222
that lived 150 to
155 million years ago

14:39.085 --> 14:40.672
during the late Jurassic period.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.813
The name allosaurus
means different lizard,

14:43.813 --> 14:45.919
but what is so
different about it?

14:45.919 --> 14:50.234
Well, other than being a
TV star, let's find out.

14:50.234 --> 14:52.822
[jungle music]

14:54.376 --> 14:57.620
What made this large meat
eating predator different

14:57.620 --> 15:00.900
was the structure of its
backbone, which was rounded

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902
and so what?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.594
Well, a rounded backbone
wasn't very common

15:05.594 --> 15:07.907
at the time of its discovery.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.841
The allosaurus, which happens
to be Utah's state fossil,

15:11.841 --> 15:13.982
is the most common
dinosaur fossil

15:13.982 --> 15:16.743
found in Utah's
Cleveland Lloyd quarry,

15:16.743 --> 15:19.401
a site containing the
densest concentration

15:19.401 --> 15:22.266
of Jurassic dinosaur
bones in the world.

15:22.266 --> 15:24.854
[jungle music]

15:30.032 --> 15:34.485
Of the what is believed to
be 74 individual dinosaurs

15:34.485 --> 15:36.936
found at the quarry,
about 46 of them

15:36.936 --> 15:39.214
are allosaurus skeletons.

15:40.594 --> 15:43.735
The bulk of allosaurus fossils
we've uncovered thus far

15:43.735 --> 15:45.599
come from the Morrison formation

15:45.599 --> 15:49.155
which can be found in
Wyoming and Colorado.

15:49.155 --> 15:51.778
[jungle music]

15:57.197 --> 16:00.787
[creature growls]

16:00.787 --> 16:01.995
Like the tyrannosaurs,

16:01.995 --> 16:04.929
allosaurus walked on
its two back legs.

16:04.929 --> 16:07.794
Its skull was large and
equipped with dozens

16:07.794 --> 16:12.005
of sharp sawlike teeth
that averaged 28 to 39 feet

16:12.005 --> 16:16.044
in length and stood
nearly 38 feet tall.

16:16.044 --> 16:18.322
The allosaurus must
have been a good hunter

16:18.322 --> 16:20.841
because it sure did eat a lot.

16:20.841 --> 16:23.672
Scientists estimate
that an adult allosaurus

16:23.672 --> 16:28.677
could have weighed in at
around 10,000 pounds, wow!

16:29.264 --> 16:31.335
[tribal music]

16:39.688 --> 16:41.897
Like other dinosaurs
in its family,

16:41.897 --> 16:44.865
the allosaurus had large
and powerful back legs

16:44.865 --> 16:48.421
and its three fingered
arms were much smaller.

16:48.421 --> 16:50.319
The allosaurus
would stay balanced

16:50.319 --> 16:53.253
thanks to its long and
heavily muscled tail.

16:53.253 --> 16:56.084
[creature growls]

17:02.193 --> 17:04.333
Wherever it lived,
the allosaurus

17:04.333 --> 17:06.473
was at the top of
its food chain.

17:06.473 --> 17:09.269
Not only was it super
strong and mean,

17:09.269 --> 17:12.893
but it was incredibly
sneaky for its size,

17:12.893 --> 17:14.964
scientists believe
that the allosaurus

17:14.964 --> 17:17.829
was a great hunter and may
have attacked large prey

17:17.829 --> 17:22.558
by ambush, using its
upper jaw like a hatchet.

17:22.558 --> 17:24.767
Yikes, watch out.

17:24.767 --> 17:27.632
It's no wonder why the
allosaurus has been featured

17:27.632 --> 17:32.189
in all forms of media, from
TV to movies to cartoons.

17:32.189 --> 17:35.226
It was truly a scary character.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.919
[creature growls]

17:40.542 --> 17:44.408
Time to meet one of the
coolest dinosaurs ever.

17:44.408 --> 17:47.135
I'm going to introduce
you to the enormous

17:47.135 --> 17:49.585
and charming stegosaurus.

17:49.585 --> 17:51.553
The stegosaurus walked the land

17:51.553 --> 17:56.558
sometime between 150 and
155 million years ago.

17:58.042 --> 18:01.218
In the western United States
and in modern day Portugal.

18:01.218 --> 18:04.083
[creature growls]

18:08.156 --> 18:10.779
[tribal music]

18:13.402 --> 18:16.129
These peaceful plant
eaters were large

18:16.129 --> 18:18.200
and extremely heavy.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.651
An adult stegosaurus
could weigh about as much

18:20.651 --> 18:23.136
as 6800 pounds.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.414
That's over three tons.

18:25.414 --> 18:27.623
Imagine all the salad
you'd have to eat

18:27.623 --> 18:29.280
to become that heavy.

18:30.488 --> 18:33.457
These magnificent beasts
were about 40 feet long

18:33.457 --> 18:35.493
and nine feet tall.

18:35.493 --> 18:39.946
They had rounded backs
and walked on all
four of their legs.

18:39.946 --> 18:42.500
[gentle music]

18:44.502 --> 18:48.265
[creature screeches]

18:48.265 --> 18:51.475
Speaking of their legs,
they had short front ones

18:51.475 --> 18:54.823
and really long
hind or back ones.

18:54.823 --> 18:57.446
They proudly carried
their spike tipped tails

18:57.446 --> 19:01.692
high in the air as a means
to let other big bully dinos

19:01.692 --> 19:04.557
like the allosaurus
and ceratosaurus know

19:04.557 --> 19:06.662
that they should stay away.

19:06.662 --> 19:09.976
[creature growls]

19:09.976 --> 19:12.565
[jungle music]

19:23.058 --> 19:26.095
The first scientists who
discovered the stegosaurus

19:26.095 --> 19:29.651
back in 1877 thought
that their large plates

19:29.651 --> 19:33.275
resembled roof shingles and
that's how it got its name.

19:33.275 --> 19:36.692
Stegosaurus means roofed lizard.

19:36.692 --> 19:40.351
Can you imagine living in a
house with stegosaurus plates

19:40.351 --> 19:44.562
on top, you would for sure
be the most popular fella

19:44.562 --> 19:47.324
in town with lots of
friends, [laughs],

19:47.324 --> 19:49.809
just like the stegosaurus.

19:49.809 --> 19:52.605
These beautiful beasts
had lots of buddies

19:52.605 --> 19:54.296
that they shared the world with

19:54.296 --> 19:59.094
such as the apatosaurus,
diplodocus, and
the brachiosaurus.

19:59.094 --> 20:02.649
I'll be sure and tell you
about those critters later.

20:02.649 --> 20:05.411
[dramatic music]

20:06.515 --> 20:08.552
Well, what do you think
of all that, guys?

20:08.552 --> 20:09.553
- Incredible.

20:10.623 --> 20:12.141
- Eye opening.

20:12.141 --> 20:13.936
- Fang-tastic.

20:13.936 --> 20:17.526
- It is, now see what
you think of this.

20:17.526 --> 20:20.288
[dramatic music]

20:22.151 --> 20:24.844
Our next prehistoric
is none other

20:24.844 --> 20:29.814
than the walking tank of a
dinosaur, the ankylosaurus.

20:29.814 --> 20:32.576
Let's take a look at this
heavily armored wonder.

20:32.576 --> 20:35.337
[dramatic music]

20:43.207 --> 20:46.935
Ankylosaurus means fused
or stiffened lizard.

20:46.935 --> 20:49.938
Their skeletons have been
found in geological formations

20:49.938 --> 20:53.390
dating to the very end
of the Cretaceous period

20:53.390 --> 20:56.841
about 66 to 68
million years ago.

20:56.841 --> 20:59.154
They've been found in
western North America

20:59.154 --> 21:02.053
during that time,
making it among the last

21:02.053 --> 21:05.056
of the non birdlike
dinosaurs discovered.

21:06.403 --> 21:09.647
The ankylosaurus was a
massive, plant eating beast.

21:09.647 --> 21:13.306
It stood about 11 feet
tall, just over a quarter

21:13.306 --> 21:15.722
of the size of New
York's Statue of Liberty

21:15.722 --> 21:19.278
and could grow up to
be about 30 feet long.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.314
What, wow!

21:21.314 --> 21:23.627
[dramatic music]

21:23.627 --> 21:26.457
[creature growls]

21:29.909 --> 21:32.360
This big dude sure
was heavy, too.

21:32.360 --> 21:36.571
It weighed around 13,000
pounds when it was fully grown.

21:36.571 --> 21:39.677
That's over six tons
and about as much

21:39.677 --> 21:44.510
as 77 adult humans, oh my!
[creature growls]

21:44.510 --> 21:47.236
[dramatic music]

21:50.792 --> 21:54.313
A prominent feature of
ankylosaurus was its armor.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.936
It consisted of knobs
and plates of bone

21:56.936 --> 22:00.388
known as osteoderms or
scutes embedded within

22:00.388 --> 22:01.665
their tough skin.

22:01.665 --> 22:04.564
Scientists are not sure
the exact placement

22:04.564 --> 22:07.498
of these plates on old anky,
but various configurations

22:07.498 --> 22:11.364
have been proposed over the
years, giving it the cool look

22:11.364 --> 22:14.194
that we're all familiar with.

22:14.194 --> 22:17.025
[creature growls]

22:21.547 --> 22:23.894
Though not directly
related to them,

22:23.894 --> 22:27.000
similar body armor can be
found on today's crocodiles

22:27.000 --> 22:28.899
and armadillos.

22:28.899 --> 22:32.351
The ankylosaurus was
certainly something to behold,

22:32.351 --> 22:35.906
especially that
tail, check that out!

22:35.906 --> 22:38.357
[drum music]

22:41.739 --> 22:45.087
Dinosaurs are cool and
larger than life creatures

22:45.087 --> 22:48.263
and people have always
been fascinated by them

22:48.263 --> 22:50.748
but have you ever found
yourself wondering

22:50.748 --> 22:54.131
what one of the biggest
dinosaurs in the world was?

22:54.131 --> 22:58.894
One that would even make
the mighty T rex shake?

22:58.894 --> 23:02.311
I'm here to introduce you to
one of them, the spinosaurus.

23:02.311 --> 23:05.107
[drum music]

23:05.107 --> 23:08.766
The spinosaurus, whose
name means spine lizard,

23:08.766 --> 23:12.287
used to stomp around what is
known now to be North Africa.

23:12.287 --> 23:16.222
About 93 to 112
million years ago.

23:16.222 --> 23:18.155
They also lived in Egypt.

23:18.155 --> 23:21.745
The first one was discovered
in 1912 by scientists

23:21.745 --> 23:25.300
who were happy and excited to
find a new breed of creature

23:25.300 --> 23:28.441
that was until then yet unknown.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.961
[flute music]

23:32.411 --> 23:34.654
The spinosaurus was among
the largest of all known

23:34.654 --> 23:38.451
meat eating dinosaurs and
could grow to be even larger

23:38.451 --> 23:39.797
than the T rex.

23:41.627 --> 23:43.663
These things were huge.

23:43.663 --> 23:46.286
[tribal music]

23:49.980 --> 23:51.844
Their skulls alone
would reach lengths

23:51.844 --> 23:53.811
of over five feet long

23:53.811 --> 23:56.849
and from head to tail they've
been known to be measured

23:56.849 --> 23:58.471
nearly 60 feet.

23:59.921 --> 24:03.614
Imagine this, just five of these
lined up next to each other

24:03.614 --> 24:08.412
would be about as large and
long as a football field, wow!

24:09.309 --> 24:12.002
And whoa were they heavy.

24:12.002 --> 24:14.004
The average spinosaurus
would weigh in

24:14.004 --> 24:18.111
at anywhere between
seven to up over 20 tons.

24:18.111 --> 24:22.184
That's as much as three
adult elephants, yowza!

24:22.184 --> 24:24.773
[tribal music]

24:27.362 --> 24:30.158
The coolest and most unique
thing about them, though,

24:30.158 --> 24:33.264
was the giant sail that
they had on their backs.

24:33.264 --> 24:36.751
This sail was made up of
massive spike shaped bones

24:36.751 --> 24:40.064
that were joined together
by a rugged layer of skin.

24:40.064 --> 24:43.447
What was the sail for other
than to make them look awesome?

24:43.447 --> 24:47.209
It is believed that the sail,
when turned toward the sun,

24:47.209 --> 24:50.350
could help keep the bodies of
these cold blooded creatures

24:50.350 --> 24:52.145
nice and warm.

24:52.145 --> 24:54.769
We have to use coats
and sweaters to do that.

24:54.769 --> 24:58.531
Dinosaurs were so much
cooler than we are.

24:58.531 --> 25:01.327
[creature growls]

25:03.674 --> 25:05.469
Wanna talk about cool?

25:05.469 --> 25:08.127
This next dinosaur,
the archaeopteryx,

25:08.127 --> 25:11.233
is known to be the beast
that bridges the gap

25:11.233 --> 25:13.788
between non flying
birdlike dinosaurs

25:13.788 --> 25:15.928
and modern birds.

25:15.928 --> 25:20.795
It's like the feathered
missing link, sorry Bigfoot.

25:20.795 --> 25:24.246
The archaeopteryx whose
name means ancient wing

25:24.246 --> 25:28.354
was originally thought to be
a bird and not a dinosaur.

25:28.354 --> 25:31.840
It wasn't until somewhere
around the late 19th century

25:31.840 --> 25:35.257
and the early 20th century
that it was discovered

25:35.257 --> 25:38.778
the archaeopteryx was not
the oldest known bird.

25:38.778 --> 25:43.472
That's right, further study
proved them to be dinosaurs.

25:43.472 --> 25:46.027
[gentle music]

25:51.964 --> 25:54.483
The archaeopteryx lived
during what is known as

25:54.483 --> 25:59.350
the late Jurassic period
around 150 million years ago.

25:59.350 --> 26:02.561
In a land that is now
part of Southern Germany.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.909
It was there during a time
when Europe was an archipelago

26:05.909 --> 26:09.429
of islands in a warm
tropical sea much closer

26:09.429 --> 26:11.431
to the equator than it is now.

26:11.431 --> 26:14.020
[gentle music]

26:17.403 --> 26:20.993
Similar in size to the
common magpies or ravens

26:20.993 --> 26:23.996
that we know today to be
flying our friendly skies,

26:23.996 --> 26:27.137
the largest species of
archaeopteryx could grow

26:27.137 --> 26:29.898
to about one foot,
eight inches in length.

26:29.898 --> 26:32.901
Yet even though it
was small in size,

26:32.901 --> 26:36.525
with broad wings this little
birdie did not possess

26:36.525 --> 26:40.633
the ability to fly or
even glide, or did it?

26:40.633 --> 26:43.222
[gentle music]

26:52.783 --> 26:55.821
Scientists of today still
debate whether or not

26:55.821 --> 26:58.271
the archaeopteryx flew or not.

26:58.271 --> 27:01.930
In 2010, paleontologists
claimed that the creature

27:01.930 --> 27:05.416
had weak feather shafts
which made flying impossible

27:05.416 --> 27:08.868
given its weight, but then
other scientists claimed

27:08.868 --> 27:12.631
that the paleontologists'
findings were incorrect

27:12.631 --> 27:16.082
and that they overestimated the
weight of the archaeopteryx.

27:16.082 --> 27:19.396
In truth, whether
or this little dino

27:19.396 --> 27:20.742
could take to the skies

27:20.742 --> 27:24.539
or not is something we
will never truly know.

27:24.539 --> 27:25.920
What do you think?

27:25.920 --> 27:28.543
[gentle music]

27:45.111 --> 27:46.837
Are you ready?

27:46.837 --> 27:50.185
A race is on and to
win it you're going
to have to be faster

27:50.185 --> 27:53.637
than one of the quickest
dinosaurs to ever run amok.

27:53.637 --> 27:56.571
Let's say hello to
the coelophysis.

27:56.571 --> 27:59.125
[gentle music]

28:03.440 --> 28:06.719
[creature rumbles]

28:06.719 --> 28:10.585
The coelophysis whose names
translates to hollow form

28:10.585 --> 28:15.590
lived approximately 196
to 203 million years ago

28:17.005 --> 28:19.180
during what was the latter
part of the Triassic period,

28:19.180 --> 28:21.976
located primarily
in what is now known

28:21.976 --> 28:24.703
as the southwestern part
of the United States.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.775
This little guy was
also a world traveler.

28:27.775 --> 28:31.088
The coelophysis could also
be found in South Africa

28:31.088 --> 28:32.745
and even Zimbabwe.

28:32.745 --> 28:35.334
[gentle music]

28:43.204 --> 28:46.655
The coelophysis was a small
and slender meat eating

28:46.655 --> 28:50.659
dinosaur that stood and ran
quickly on its two strong legs.

28:50.659 --> 28:53.248
[gentle music]

28:57.459 --> 28:59.634
Fully grown, an adult
coelophysis could reach almost

28:59.634 --> 29:04.535
10 feet long, three feet tall
and weigh about 100 pounds.

29:04.535 --> 29:08.056
That's about the size
of a five year old boy.

29:08.056 --> 29:10.679
[gentle music]

29:19.585 --> 29:22.346
Coelophysis had hollow
bones and this made it

29:22.346 --> 29:26.212
a very fast and agile runner,
capable of reaching speeds

29:26.212 --> 29:28.801
of more than 30 miles per hour.

29:28.801 --> 29:31.424
[gentle music]

29:37.810 --> 29:41.710
Even cooler, the coelophysis
was also the first ever

29:41.710 --> 29:45.059
dinosaur discovered
that had a furcula.

29:45.059 --> 29:46.198
What's that?

29:46.198 --> 29:48.959
No, it's not a
famous fuzzy vampire.

29:48.959 --> 29:52.238
It's a wishbone, just like
the kind you would find

29:52.238 --> 29:54.171
in a turkey at Thanksgiving.

29:54.171 --> 29:58.348
Imagine having a coelophysis
for dinner instead of a turkey.

29:58.348 --> 30:02.628
Hope you have a big family,
ha, if you won the snapping

30:02.628 --> 30:05.873
of the wishbone, what
would you wish for?

30:05.873 --> 30:08.910
It's a good thing
coelophysis was so fast

30:08.910 --> 30:10.878
because if you got
a good look at it,

30:10.878 --> 30:13.604
you may laugh at the
look on his face.

30:13.604 --> 30:17.091
This little critter had
massive eyes for his size

30:17.091 --> 30:20.853
and he may have looked
funny but he was very smart.

30:20.853 --> 30:23.856
Those big eyes indicated
that this little track star

30:23.856 --> 30:26.859
had a big brain to
go along with them.

30:26.859 --> 30:30.035
Scientists also
believe those same eyes

30:30.035 --> 30:32.037
helped it hunt at night thanks

30:32.037 --> 30:36.006
to the extra visual
information it could spy.

30:36.006 --> 30:38.595
[tribal music]

30:47.776 --> 30:51.988
Coelophysis was first
discovered way back in the 1880s

30:51.988 --> 30:55.267
and after that, they were
kind of hard to find.

30:55.267 --> 30:57.579
They didn't stay hidden
for long, though.

30:57.579 --> 31:00.859
In 1947, when a
dutiful fossil hunter

31:00.859 --> 31:03.827
discovered thousands
of coelophysis bones

31:03.827 --> 31:06.830
representing all growth
stages from hatchlings

31:06.830 --> 31:09.212
to juveniles to
teenagers and adults,

31:09.212 --> 31:13.768
tangled together in New
Mexico's ghost ranch quarry.

31:13.768 --> 31:16.909
This led to the coelophysis
being named the official

31:16.909 --> 31:19.325
state dinosaur of New Mexico.

31:19.325 --> 31:21.672
Ha, how cool is that?

31:21.672 --> 31:24.227
[tribal music]

31:28.817 --> 31:32.787
Maybe one day you'll be an
official something in your state

31:32.787 --> 31:35.514
and if that happens,
make sure you remember.

31:36.446 --> 31:39.276
[creature growls]

31:41.175 --> 31:46.180
This next dino-riffic creature
is full of bull-loney.

31:47.388 --> 31:49.079
Well, not really, we
don't know if it lied

31:49.079 --> 31:51.116
to get the best
meals or anything.

31:51.116 --> 31:54.464
We just know that the
carnotaurus had a few things

31:54.464 --> 31:57.398
in common with the
bulls you see today.

31:57.398 --> 31:58.675
Let's find out what.

32:01.609 --> 32:04.094
The carnotaurus, whose
name literally means

32:04.094 --> 32:08.443
meat eating bull was a
pretty big and hungry dude

32:08.443 --> 32:12.068
who lived in South
America during the
late Cretaceous period

32:12.068 --> 32:16.417
about 69 to 72
million years ago.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.937
[piano music]

32:22.009 --> 32:25.460
Carnotaurus was a highly
recognizable beast.

32:25.460 --> 32:28.394
Like the bulls we
mentioned earlier of today,

32:28.394 --> 32:31.915
our friend here at thick
horns above its eyes,

32:31.915 --> 32:36.195
a feature unseen in all
other meat eating dinosaurs.

32:36.195 --> 32:39.647
It also had a very
deep skull sitting

32:39.647 --> 32:42.098
on a super muscular neck.

32:42.098 --> 32:44.617
[piano music]

32:48.242 --> 32:51.624
Carnotaurus was big and
strong and except for

32:51.624 --> 32:54.006
its massive horns,
it also looked

32:54.006 --> 32:57.078
a lot like the
tyrannosaurus rex.

32:57.078 --> 33:00.979
The carnotaurus grew
to about 30 feet long,

33:00.979 --> 33:05.984
around nine feet tall and
weighed in at over 3000 pounds.

33:07.123 --> 33:09.918
That's as big as 10
gorillas. [laughs]

33:09.918 --> 33:12.404
[piano music]

33:15.303 --> 33:17.892
Despite being that big in size,

33:17.892 --> 33:20.515
its bones were
relatively lightweight

33:20.515 --> 33:24.347
and because of that, the
carnotaurus could run fast.

33:24.347 --> 33:26.901
About 35 miles per hour.

33:26.901 --> 33:28.627
This would make it much faster

33:28.627 --> 33:30.560
than an average human of today

33:30.560 --> 33:34.081
and almost as fast
as a crafty cougar.

33:34.081 --> 33:36.773
An adult carnotaurus
could even keep up

33:36.773 --> 33:38.499
with the speedy kangaroo,

33:38.499 --> 33:41.571
who can hop up to
44 miles per hour.

33:41.571 --> 33:45.747
Whoa, how cool would it
have been to see that race?

33:45.747 --> 33:48.129
[epic music]

33:51.995 --> 33:55.964
Of all the plant
eating dinosaurs that
have been discovered

33:55.964 --> 33:59.037
the gigantic brontosaurus
is without question

33:59.037 --> 34:02.143
the most famous and
coolest of them all.

34:02.143 --> 34:04.145
Let's find out all
there is to know

34:04.145 --> 34:06.389
about this long necked wonder.

34:06.389 --> 34:08.839
[epic music]

34:12.014 --> 34:15.467
The brontosaurus, whose
name means thunder lizard,

34:15.467 --> 34:18.366
lived around 150
million years ago

34:18.366 --> 34:20.643
during the Jurassic
period in the western part

34:20.643 --> 34:22.405
of the northern hemisphere.

34:22.405 --> 34:25.476
Its remains have been
found in Utah, Wyoming

34:25.476 --> 34:27.134
and even Mexico.

34:27.134 --> 34:31.621
It was an incredibly big,
heavy and strong dinosaur

34:31.621 --> 34:35.210
with its tiny head held
upon its super long neck,

34:35.210 --> 34:39.491
it could reach lengths of
about 70 to 90 feet tall.

34:39.491 --> 34:43.045
That's almost 3/4 of New
York's Statue of Liberty,

34:43.045 --> 34:45.806
which is over 150 feet tall.

34:45.806 --> 34:49.534
Maybe the brontosaurus could
tickle her under her arm.

34:49.534 --> 34:51.158
Ha, that would be funny.

34:51.158 --> 34:53.574
[epic music]

34:58.026 --> 35:00.339
The brontosaurus
wasn't just tall.

35:00.339 --> 35:05.033
He was also about 72
feet long and he weighed

35:05.033 --> 35:09.417
around 33,000 pounds, whoa.

35:09.417 --> 35:11.764
That's as big as a
small cruise ship,

35:11.764 --> 35:15.630
can you imagine sailing on
the back of a brontosaurus?

35:15.630 --> 35:18.185
If you could climb up
to the top of its head,

35:18.185 --> 35:21.257
you could really
get a good sun tan.

35:21.257 --> 35:24.018
[creature roars]

35:27.401 --> 35:30.714
The brontosaurus was a
peaceful and friendly dinosaur

35:30.714 --> 35:33.545
but sometimes other mean
dinosaurs would pick

35:33.545 --> 35:36.444
a fight with it,
not a good idea.

35:36.444 --> 35:39.275
As the brontosaurus would
use its powerful tail

35:39.275 --> 35:43.210
as a weapon to whip any foolish
dinosaurs out of its way.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.626
[epic music]

35:52.460 --> 35:54.911
[drum music]

35:56.119 --> 35:58.328
What's that staring
at you in the dark?

35:58.328 --> 36:01.262
Today it would most
likely be an owl,

36:01.262 --> 36:05.197
but way back when it was
probably a relatively small

36:05.197 --> 36:07.717
birdlike dinosaur
from the Campion age

36:07.717 --> 36:11.445
of the Cretaceous period
known as the troodon.

36:11.445 --> 36:13.895
[drum music]

36:21.593 --> 36:25.666
This little guy was first
discovered in October 1855

36:25.666 --> 36:29.635
and was one of the
first dinosaurs found
in North America.

36:29.635 --> 36:32.431
Believe it or not, it was
thought to be a lizard

36:32.431 --> 36:37.125
until 1877, but not
your normal sized gecko.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.713
How big was this guy?

36:38.713 --> 36:41.371
Troodons grew to
about three feet tall

36:41.371 --> 36:44.098
and eight feet long
from head to tail.

36:44.098 --> 36:48.447
They weighed about 100
pounds or two second graders.

36:48.447 --> 36:50.863
[drum music]

36:58.630 --> 37:00.942
Troodons were crafty
little meat eaters

37:00.942 --> 37:02.806
and are believed
to be night hunters

37:02.806 --> 37:05.257
given their oversized eyes.

37:05.257 --> 37:09.192
These huge eyes helped them
to see clearly in the dark.

37:09.192 --> 37:11.229
They must have been
pretty smart, too

37:11.229 --> 37:15.336
as their brains were considered
to be big for their size.

37:15.336 --> 37:19.685
They also had a really big
set of hind or back legs too,

37:19.685 --> 37:22.792
making them as speedy
as they were clever.

37:22.792 --> 37:25.173
But do you know what
they didn't have?

37:25.173 --> 37:27.279
Dentists, ouch.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.695
[drum music]

37:47.092 --> 37:50.509
You may not realize it,
but dinosaurs didn't just

37:50.509 --> 37:54.306
suddenly spring into existence
200 million years ago

37:54.306 --> 37:57.585
as huge toothy and
extremely hungry beasts.

37:57.585 --> 38:00.105
Just like all living
creatures, they evolved

38:00.105 --> 38:02.763
from a family of
primitive reptiles

38:02.763 --> 38:06.525
that are known as archosaurs
or ruling lizards.

38:06.525 --> 38:09.114
[gentle music]

38:12.945 --> 38:14.706
Archosaurs weren't
all that different

38:14.706 --> 38:16.915
from the dinosaurs
that evolved from them.

38:16.915 --> 38:20.056
The main difference was
that these Triassic reptiles

38:20.056 --> 38:23.370
were a lot smaller than the
dinosaurs we have all come

38:23.370 --> 38:25.268
to know over the years.

38:25.268 --> 38:28.340
They did, however,
possess certain features

38:28.340 --> 38:31.447
that set them apart from
their more famous descendants.

38:31.447 --> 38:35.658
Some of whom we are going to
learn all about right here.

38:35.658 --> 38:38.626
But even the archosaurs
are believed to have come

38:38.626 --> 38:40.870
from another type of creature.

38:40.870 --> 38:42.975
Paleontologists believe
that they have identified

38:42.975 --> 38:47.394
the archosaur from which
all dinosaurs are evolved.

38:47.394 --> 38:50.500
This little fellow was
known as the lagosuchus,

38:50.500 --> 38:52.847
or sometimes even marisuchus,

38:52.847 --> 38:54.884
translated from
the Greek language,

38:54.884 --> 38:58.025
its name means rabbit crocodile.

38:58.025 --> 39:00.407
Is that cute or what?

39:00.407 --> 39:03.962
[creature growls]

39:03.962 --> 39:06.344
[epic music]

39:11.141 --> 39:14.490
The lagosuchus was a quick
and tiny little reptile

39:14.490 --> 39:16.733
that scurried across
the dense forests

39:16.733 --> 39:20.081
of early South America
during the Triassic period.

39:20.081 --> 39:23.637
Even cooler, the archosaurs
of the Triassic period

39:23.637 --> 39:27.365
also spawned the very
first flying reptiles,

39:27.365 --> 39:31.886
known as pterosaurs, and even
the crocodiles we know today.

39:31.886 --> 39:35.545
Scientists believe that
the Pangean supercontinent,

39:35.545 --> 39:38.168
which was the largest
land mass on the planet

39:38.168 --> 39:42.138
during its time, was home
to all manner of archosaurs

39:42.138 --> 39:47.143
and believe it or not, even
two legged crocodiles, whoa.

39:47.730 --> 39:49.904
[epic music]

39:52.942 --> 39:55.703
[creature roars]

39:58.499 --> 40:01.813
Everyone likes to come in
first, but can you imagine

40:01.813 --> 40:04.160
being the first?

40:04.160 --> 40:07.646
In history, the
megalosaurus was first,

40:07.646 --> 40:12.340
as in the first dinosaur to
ever be given a scientific name

40:12.340 --> 40:15.516
but there's so much more
about this great lizard

40:15.516 --> 40:18.312
than its name implies,
let's get to know it.

40:18.312 --> 40:20.694
[drum music]

40:23.248 --> 40:26.700
The megalosaurus was a
large, meat eating dinosaur

40:26.700 --> 40:29.910
that lived in what was
the middle Jurassic period

40:29.910 --> 40:33.154
about 166 million years ago

40:33.154 --> 40:35.743
in what is now known
as Southern England.

40:35.743 --> 40:40.783
Scientists discovered this
big dude way back in 1824

40:40.783 --> 40:43.993
in a quarry at Stone's
Field in Oxfordshire.

40:43.993 --> 40:47.859
But to date, there's not a
lot known about this titan

40:47.859 --> 40:50.171
because no one has ever found

40:50.171 --> 40:52.553
a complete
megalosaurus skeleton.

40:57.178 --> 41:00.837
That was only one of the
megalosaurus's firsts.

41:00.837 --> 41:03.771
Along with the iguanodon,
the megalosaurus

41:03.771 --> 41:07.119
was also one of the first
ever dinosaur models

41:07.119 --> 41:09.397
to ever be shown to the public.

41:09.397 --> 41:13.574
It took place at the London's
World's Fair way back in 1854.

41:15.024 --> 41:18.717
Wow, imagine what the first
people to ever get to look

41:18.717 --> 41:21.099
at a dinosaur must
have been thinking.

41:21.099 --> 41:23.170
Talk about wondrous.

41:23.170 --> 41:25.552
[drum music]

41:29.107 --> 41:32.110
Another first for the
megalosaurus is that it was

41:32.110 --> 41:35.078
the first dinosaur to
ever be talked about

41:35.078 --> 41:36.977
in modern fiction print.

41:36.977 --> 41:41.188
In 1853, the great and
famous British author

41:41.188 --> 41:44.156
Charles Dickens wrote
in his book Bleak House,

41:44.156 --> 41:47.401
it would not be wonderful
to meet a megalosaurus,

41:47.401 --> 41:51.716
40 feet long or so, waddling
like an elephantine lizard,

41:51.716 --> 41:56.514
up Pulvern Hill, ha, would you
want to meet a megalosaurus?

41:56.514 --> 41:57.653
Not me.

41:57.653 --> 42:00.069
[drum music]

42:04.970 --> 42:08.318
While no one has been able
to piece together accurately

42:08.318 --> 42:10.838
just what a megalosaurus
looked like,

42:10.838 --> 42:14.601
one thing is for sure,
it is widely believed

42:14.601 --> 42:17.120
that this beast was big.

42:17.120 --> 42:21.918
[epic music]
[creature roars]

42:21.918 --> 42:25.335
One of the first dinosaurs
to ever be discovered

42:25.335 --> 42:29.823
was the mighty iguanodon, and
we're ready to introduce you

42:29.823 --> 42:33.033
to this marvelous plant
eating gentle giant.

42:33.033 --> 42:35.483
[epic music]

42:39.004 --> 42:40.627
The iguanodon, a
duck billed creature

42:40.627 --> 42:43.422
whose name means
iguana tooth, existed

42:43.422 --> 42:45.390
in the early Cretaceous period,

42:45.390 --> 42:47.944
all the way to the
late Jurassic period,

42:47.944 --> 42:51.948
99 to 160 million years ago.

42:51.948 --> 42:55.503
They had lots of homes too
and were found to be native

42:55.503 --> 43:00.025
to Asia, Australia, Africa,
Europe and North America.

43:00.025 --> 43:02.338
[epic music]

43:04.443 --> 43:06.618
Iguanodons were
large, bulky critters

43:06.618 --> 43:10.449
that weighed about as much
as a big van does today.

43:10.449 --> 43:12.244
Up to five tons.

43:12.244 --> 43:14.661
[epic music]

43:19.631 --> 43:24.567
These handsome fellows could
grow to be around 39 feet long.

43:25.948 --> 43:28.364
Because of their weight, they
were one of the slowpokes

43:28.364 --> 43:31.643
of the dinosaur kingdom,
moving only at an estimated

43:31.643 --> 43:34.612
14 miles per hour at top speed.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.062
[epic music]

43:41.929 --> 43:45.761
The iguanodon stood mostly on
their two massive back legs

43:45.761 --> 43:48.833
but they could walk
on all fours as well.

43:48.833 --> 43:53.838
Their arms were only 25%
smaller than their hind legs

43:55.253 --> 43:57.738
and would usually hang low
while the creature would walk.

43:57.738 --> 44:01.673
Their arms may have
been smaller, but
they were super handy.

44:01.673 --> 44:05.297
Like humans, each
iguanodon had five fingers.

44:05.297 --> 44:07.990
That count includes
a large thumb spike

44:07.990 --> 44:10.406
which they would use
to protect themselves

44:10.406 --> 44:12.270
from other meanies out there.

44:12.270 --> 44:14.652
[epic music]

44:23.971 --> 44:27.526
Here's another big
guy, the gigantosaurus,

44:27.526 --> 44:30.081
whose name means
giant Southern lizard,

44:30.081 --> 44:32.566
lived in what is now
known as Argentina

44:32.566 --> 44:36.639
approximately 97 to
98 million years ago

44:36.639 --> 44:39.918
and was one of the largest
known meat eating dinosaurs

44:39.918 --> 44:41.230
in the world.

44:41.230 --> 44:43.646
[epic music]

44:47.408 --> 44:51.102
The gigantosaurus was discovered
by an amateur fossil hunter

44:51.102 --> 44:53.449
who got a lot more
than he bargained for

44:53.449 --> 44:56.486
when he unearthed the
bones of this huge lizard

44:56.486 --> 45:01.422
in the Patagonian region
of Argentina back in 1993.

45:02.009 --> 45:03.562
How big was it?

45:03.562 --> 45:05.910
To be honest, the exact size
has been hard to figure out

45:05.910 --> 45:09.292
due to the incompleteness
of the gigantosaurus bones

45:09.292 --> 45:11.398
scientists have found so far.

45:11.398 --> 45:13.711
That makes it next
to impossible to say

45:13.711 --> 45:16.230
that it was definitely
bigger than the fearsome

45:16.230 --> 45:19.337
tyrannosaurus rex, which
it predated by a whopping

45:19.337 --> 45:24.342
30 million years, but it's a
popular belief that it was.

45:24.929 --> 45:27.069
[epic music]

45:31.107 --> 45:34.317
There have been lots of
size estimates concluded

45:34.317 --> 45:38.114
by several researchers based
on all sorts of methods.

45:38.114 --> 45:40.220
Depending on how the missing
parts of the skeleton

45:40.220 --> 45:43.948
have been put back together,
many people believe

45:43.948 --> 45:46.882
that the actual size
of the gigantosaurus

45:46.882 --> 45:49.781
falls somewhere between
the tyrannosaurus rex

45:49.781 --> 45:51.956
and the mighty spinosaurus.

45:51.956 --> 45:54.372
[epic music]

45:58.548 --> 46:00.067
Here's what we know for sure

46:00.067 --> 46:03.691
about this titan among
dinosaurs so far.

46:03.691 --> 46:06.971
Judging by what has been found
of these glorious beasts,

46:06.971 --> 46:10.181
the gigantosaurus had
a really strong neck

46:10.181 --> 46:12.839
and the bone connecting
its noggin to its neck

46:12.839 --> 46:15.600
was very big and
pretty powerful.

46:15.600 --> 46:18.430
[creature growls]

46:20.674 --> 46:24.609
In the movie Jurassic Park,
the interesting little creature

46:24.609 --> 46:28.544
known as the dilaphosaurus
was a poison spitting monster

46:28.544 --> 46:31.340
with an expandable
frill around its neck.

46:31.340 --> 46:34.584
But sometimes things
are not what they seem.

46:34.584 --> 46:38.968
In fact, the meat
eating dilaphosaurus
was far from little,

46:38.968 --> 46:42.144
had no neck frill
and never spit poison

46:42.144 --> 46:44.008
at anything or anyone.

46:44.008 --> 46:47.183
Let's get smart and learn
the facts, what do you say?

46:47.183 --> 46:49.807
[tribal music]

46:58.125 --> 47:01.853
Dilaphosaurus, whose name
means two crested lizard,

47:01.853 --> 47:04.960
lived in what is now North
America during the early

47:04.960 --> 47:09.792
Jurassic period, about
193 million years ago.

47:09.792 --> 47:12.968
In the 1940s, three
skeletons were found

47:12.968 --> 47:16.316
in northern Arizona, and
scientists immediately

47:16.316 --> 47:18.905
began putting together
the puzzle to solve

47:18.905 --> 47:22.011
the mysteries of these
newly discovered creatures.

47:22.011 --> 47:24.427
[epic music]

47:36.819 --> 47:40.650
Did you know that dilaphosaurus
was one of the first big

47:40.650 --> 47:43.170
predatory dinosaurs,
though it was smaller

47:43.170 --> 47:44.723
than some later ones?

47:44.723 --> 47:47.692
It was slender and lightly
built and though the skull

47:47.692 --> 47:51.006
was proportionately
large, it was delicate.

47:51.006 --> 47:53.871
The dilaphosaurus's
snout was narrow

47:53.871 --> 47:57.805
and the upper jaw had a gap
or kink below the nostril.

47:57.805 --> 48:00.325
What made it most
recognizable, though,

48:00.325 --> 48:03.881
is the pair of plate
shaped crests on its skull.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.435
[tribal music]

48:11.785 --> 48:15.651
Dilaphosaurus's teeth
were long, curved, thin

48:15.651 --> 48:17.653
and compressed sideways.

48:17.653 --> 48:21.174
The teeth of this critter's
lower jaw were much smaller

48:21.174 --> 48:23.486
than the ones found
on its upper jaw.

48:23.486 --> 48:26.904
Most of the teeth had
serrations or tinier teeth

48:26.904 --> 48:31.632
at their front and back edges
and were covered in enamel.

48:31.632 --> 48:35.843
Enamel covers your teeth too,
so you'd better brush them

48:35.843 --> 48:38.363
to make sure that
they stay strong.

48:38.363 --> 48:40.814
[epic music]

48:49.374 --> 48:51.998
Its neck was long,
its bones were hollow.

48:51.998 --> 48:56.485
This made it very light, so
its movements were very fast.

48:56.485 --> 48:58.487
Dilaphosaurus had powerful arms

48:58.487 --> 49:01.628
with four sharply
clawed fingers.

49:01.628 --> 49:04.976
They also had large legs
which they would stand upon,

49:04.976 --> 49:08.738
making them total about
nine feet tall, wow!

49:08.738 --> 49:11.293
[tribal music]

49:14.952 --> 49:18.024
How cool would it be if
you had your very own

49:18.024 --> 49:20.095
built in musical instrument?

49:20.095 --> 49:23.098
The plant eating dinosaur
the parasaurolophus,

49:23.098 --> 49:26.273
has just that, and
that's not the only thing

49:26.273 --> 49:28.966
that sets it apart from
the usual big lizard.

49:28.966 --> 49:31.589
[tribal music]

49:34.523 --> 49:37.975
The parasaurolophus
whose names translates to

49:37.975 --> 49:41.495
near crested lizard lived
in what is now North America

49:41.495 --> 49:43.497
during the late
Cretaceous period

49:43.497 --> 49:46.362
about 66 to 70
million years ago.

49:46.362 --> 49:48.951
[tribal music]

49:54.301 --> 49:56.717
Standing at about
eight feet tall,

49:56.717 --> 49:59.341
they would have made
great basketball players

49:59.341 --> 50:02.206
but they were a little
too long for the court,

50:02.206 --> 50:04.794
measuring in at about 33 feet

50:04.794 --> 50:08.212
and weighing in at an average
of three and a half tons.

50:08.212 --> 50:10.766
That's about as
much as a cargo van

50:10.766 --> 50:14.528
and cargo vans weren't very
good at basketball either, ha.

50:14.528 --> 50:17.083
[tribal music]

50:18.739 --> 50:21.328
What sets these cute
little critters apart

50:21.328 --> 50:24.366
from other dinosaurs is
the cool looking crest

50:24.366 --> 50:27.127
upon their heads that
was used for trumpeting.

50:27.127 --> 50:30.027
Their crest was hollow
and had tubes leading

50:30.027 --> 50:33.030
from each nostril to
the tops of their heads.

50:33.030 --> 50:36.343
Imagine having two flutes
attached to your nose.

50:36.343 --> 50:39.691
You may have looked funny, but
wow, would you sound great.

50:39.691 --> 50:42.211
[tribal music]

50:49.184 --> 50:51.600
Scientists originally
thought that the tubes

50:51.600 --> 50:54.499
of a parasaurolophus
were originally used

50:54.499 --> 50:57.606
as a snorkel to help them
swim around underwater

50:57.606 --> 50:59.539
for long periods of time.

50:59.539 --> 51:01.920
Later, though, it was
discovered that the tips

51:01.920 --> 51:04.337
of these tubes had no air holes,

51:04.337 --> 51:06.339
so that would be impossible.

51:06.339 --> 51:07.857
So what are they for?

51:07.857 --> 51:10.757
These built in noisemakers
are what they would use

51:10.757 --> 51:13.242
to talk and keep
track of each other.

51:13.242 --> 51:16.107
Ha, can you imagine what
a group of them must have

51:16.107 --> 51:18.075
sounded like when
they were together?

51:18.075 --> 51:20.249
Much louder than you
and your friends.

51:20.249 --> 51:23.218
Ha, just think of
those crazy tunes.

51:23.218 --> 51:27.049
It would be like an
incredible Jurassic concert.

51:27.049 --> 51:29.603
[tribal music]

51:35.022 --> 51:38.060
[creature growls]

51:38.060 --> 51:39.855
When not tooting the night away,

51:39.855 --> 51:42.858
the parasaurolophus could
be found walking around

51:42.858 --> 51:45.826
on either two or all
four of its legs,

51:45.826 --> 51:49.485
making it easier for them to
snag those late night snacks

51:49.485 --> 51:52.557
of fruits and veggies with
their duck like beaks.

51:52.557 --> 51:54.973
[epic music]

51:57.390 --> 52:00.945
It sure would be cool if some
of the more gentle dinosaurs

52:00.945 --> 52:04.983
were still around, but sadly,
their time has come and gone.

52:04.983 --> 52:07.434
So what happened to them?

52:07.434 --> 52:10.713
That kind of explanation
can be really complicated

52:10.713 --> 52:13.268
but let's see if we can
answer that question for you

52:13.268 --> 52:15.787
in simple terms.

52:15.787 --> 52:19.826
About 66 million years ago,
something happened on earth

52:19.826 --> 52:22.932
which scientists call the KPG,

52:22.932 --> 52:26.143
the Cretaceous Paleogene
extinction event.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.593
Otherwise known as the KT,

52:28.593 --> 52:31.493
the Cretaceous Tertiary
extinction event.

52:31.493 --> 52:33.943
[epic music]

52:37.257 --> 52:39.225
What does extinction mean?

52:39.225 --> 52:42.573
Well, that's what happens
when things go away forever.

52:42.573 --> 52:44.885
During the time
we just described,

52:44.885 --> 52:47.302
a very big extinction took place

52:47.302 --> 52:50.270
and some 3/4 of the
plant and animal species

52:50.270 --> 52:51.892
on the planet died off

52:51.892 --> 52:53.791
with the exception
of some animals

52:53.791 --> 52:58.175
that are still alive today like
sea turtles and crocodiles.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.556
[epic music]

53:04.733 --> 53:07.908
Interestingly enough,
no animals weighing more

53:07.908 --> 53:10.877
than 55 pounds survived.

53:10.877 --> 53:13.880
This event marked the end
of the Cretaceous period

53:13.880 --> 53:16.054
and the beginning of
our current period

53:16.054 --> 53:18.022
known as the Cenozoic era.

53:18.022 --> 53:19.886
[creature growls]

53:19.886 --> 53:22.268
[epic music]

53:23.441 --> 53:26.858
In 1980, a team of
scientists proposed

53:26.858 --> 53:31.138
that the KPG extinction was
caused by a massive comet

53:31.138 --> 53:33.520
or asteroid hitting
the earth about

53:33.520 --> 53:35.936
that 66 million years ago.

53:35.936 --> 53:40.320
Upon impact, the asteroid
set off a really cold winter,

53:40.320 --> 53:43.772
much longer and colder than
the winters we know today.

53:43.772 --> 53:46.533
[epic music]

53:46.533 --> 53:49.778
The endless cold made
it impossible for plants

53:49.778 --> 53:52.229
and animals to do
what they needed to do

53:52.229 --> 53:54.231
to live long and prosper.

53:54.231 --> 53:57.648
As a result, a wide range
of plants and animals

53:57.648 --> 54:00.685
passed on during
the KPG extinction.

54:00.685 --> 54:03.309
Unfortunately, both
kinds of dinosaurs,

54:03.309 --> 54:06.484
birdlike and otherwise,
were the poor victims

54:06.484 --> 54:07.554
of this happenstance.

54:07.554 --> 54:10.005
[epic music]

54:14.561 --> 54:19.152
Scientists believe that
an estimated 75% or more

54:19.152 --> 54:23.363
of all species on
earth vanished, wow!

54:23.363 --> 54:26.297
That's super scary,
but thankfully

54:26.297 --> 54:29.127
our friends the dinosaurs
left enough behind

54:29.127 --> 54:32.545
for us to find, study and
piece together information

54:32.545 --> 54:34.063
about them.

54:34.063 --> 54:36.583
Their existence will live
on both in our imaginations

54:36.583 --> 54:39.966
and in museums where we
can go and visit them.

54:44.764 --> 54:46.144
- [Scale] We learned so much
from you, Professor Claw.

54:46.144 --> 54:49.527
- Yeah, whatever can
we do to repay you?

54:49.527 --> 54:53.013
- Hmm, well, you can
bring me a burger

54:53.013 --> 54:55.292
from Space Jack's fly
through, everything on it.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.431
- Deal.
