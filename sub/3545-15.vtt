<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.041 --> 00:04.375
John, you're a toy.
You and me, no future.

00:04.458 --> 00:05.792
<i>Once some things are said...</i>

00:05.875 --> 00:08.667
Remember what it's like
to work a 60-hour week?

00:08.750 --> 00:10.542
<i>...you can't take them back.</i>

00:10.625 --> 00:13.834
No one cares as much
about finding Deirdre as I do.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.250
- You shot yourself?
- Pretty lame, huh?

00:17.333 --> 00:19.458
<i>- The damage is already done.</i>
<i>- </i>Mom.

00:19.583 --> 00:22.166
- You're not taking her away from me.
- Get out.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.792
I needed you to see something.
They stole it from Mike’s garage.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.375
Is that blood?

00:29.542 --> 00:35.041
<i>Bree Van De Kamp</i>
<i>believed in old-fashioned values.</i>

00:35.166 --> 00:37.750
<i>Things like respect for God,</i>

00:38.667 --> 00:41.709
<i>the importance of family,</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:45.000
<i>and love of country.</i>

00:46.500 --> 00:50.417
<i>In fact, Bree believed</i>
<i>so strongly in her values,</i>

00:50.542 --> 00:54.542
<i>it was always a shock</i>
<i>whenever she was confronted</i>

00:54.667 --> 00:56.959
<i>with those who didn't.</i>

00:59.083 --> 01:02.750
- It's not mine.
- You promised the cheating had stopped.

01:02.875 --> 01:06.625
Could we not yell at each other?
I'm feeling lousy today.

01:06.709 --> 01:11.375
- I want you out of the house.
- Bree, look at me. It's not mine.

01:11.458 --> 01:15.542
It didn't just magically appear
in my laundry basket.

01:15.625 --> 01:19.417
I'm not the only guy in this house
that uses that hamper.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.917
- No.
- Sorry.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
- Andrew's still a child.
- He's 16. It's not unheard of.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.417
- Honey, talk to him.
- And tell him what?

01:29.500 --> 01:33.709
That we found his condom and
that he is forbidden from... You know.

01:33.792 --> 01:37.709
I can tell him we think he's too young,
but it won't do any good.

01:37.792 --> 01:41.917
We can search his room and if we find
any more, we'll confiscate them.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.667
- That will accomplish what?
- If we take away his condoms...

01:45.750 --> 01:50.583
He's a teenage boy. We could take away
his penis, he'd still try to have sex.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.041
Well, we can't put it back in his room.

01:53.125 --> 01:56.417
That would be like we're condoning
pre-marital sex.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.542
Bree, let me put this another way.

02:02.959 --> 02:05.709
Do you want to become a grandmother?

02:09.375 --> 02:13.458
<i>Yes, Bree believed</i>
<i>in old-fashioned values.</i>

02:15.000 --> 02:17.875
<i>But she also believed</i>

02:18.000 --> 02:22.834
<i>it was better to be safe than sorry.</i>

03:06.417 --> 03:10.083
<i>Each new morning in suburbia</i>
<i>brings with it...</i>

03:11.750 --> 03:15.667
<i>...a new set of lies.</i>
<i>Little white lies, told not to hurt...</i>

03:15.750 --> 03:18.417
Morning, Mrs. Petchul,
you look lovely today.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.041
<i>...but to make life more pleasant.</i>

03:22.750 --> 03:25.750
<i>They tell these lies</i>
<i>to protect themselves</i>

03:25.834 --> 03:27.959
<i>and their reputations.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:31.000
Oh, for God's sake,
this is unbelievable.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.583
This is the last time
I do my banking online.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.250
<i>Of course, every now and then,</i>

03:39.375 --> 03:44.291
<i>the day arrives when someone</i>
<i>finally decides to tell the truth.</i>

03:44.375 --> 03:47.125
He was shot?
How could you not tell us about this?

03:47.208 --> 03:51.458
He was embarrassed.
He said it was an accident.

03:51.542 --> 03:54.542
Don't look at me like that.
Accidents happen.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.500
We know you want to trust Mike,

03:56.583 --> 03:59.667
but he had a dead woman's jewelry
in his garage.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.250
Now did he?
We don't know that for sure.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.333
All we know is that Lynette's kids
turned up with it.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.792
Are you saying
the twins murdered Martha?

04:07.875 --> 04:10.750
Well, I wouldn't put it past them.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.667
That is about
as likely as Mike having done it.

04:13.792 --> 04:18.875
He's a good guy. I know him.
I mean, he's Mike.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.125
I don't think Mike did it either,

04:21.208 --> 04:24.709
but if we don't call,
we're guilty of withholding evidence.

04:24.834 --> 04:29.250
If he is innocent, this should be
a simple matter to clear up.

04:29.333 --> 04:33.333
But we will do
whatever you want us to do.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.291
OK, call.

04:41.417 --> 04:44.834
- Shall I just dial 911?
- It's not really an emergency.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.375
- There was a murder.
- Well, not recently.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.333
Will you just call?

05:00.166 --> 05:03.583
My Mom will be home any minute.
She'll freak if she sees you.

05:03.667 --> 05:08.417
I just wanted to deliver this
personally. I'm having a party.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.291
You know she doesn't want us
to see each other.

05:13.041 --> 05:16.667
Well, you gotta come.
You're the reason I'm doing this.

05:17.792 --> 05:22.041
I'll try to talk to my Mom, OK?
But you really gotta go.

05:28.875 --> 05:33.000
- Hey, Mrs. Solis.
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?

05:33.083 --> 05:35.542
Yeah, I'm Justin, John's roommate.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.709
I've been waiting forever for you.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.917
- Really? Why?
- I want to do you a favor.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.125
What kind of favor?

05:43.208 --> 05:48.041
John says that you can't afford
a gardener right now,

05:48.166 --> 05:51.709
and I told him I'd be happy to do it.
For free.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.750
You want to mow my lawn for free?

05:54.875 --> 05:59.166
Mow your lawn.
Water your flowers. Trim your bushes.

06:00.583 --> 06:03.250
I could do everything
John did for you.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.792
That's very generous of you,
but I don't think so.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.166
Why?

06:08.291 --> 06:11.458
Because my husband is home
quite a lot these days.

06:11.542 --> 06:15.333
If any bush needs trimming,
he takes care of it.

06:15.417 --> 06:20.083
This is a beautiful yard. I'm sure
it could use a little extra attention.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.959
I'm flattered, but no, thank you.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.417
Mrs. Solis, please.

06:29.166 --> 06:33.125
Did I mention why my husband's
home a lot? He's under house arrest.

06:34.333 --> 06:37.500
He has a lot of anger
toward the government right now,

06:37.583 --> 06:41.834
and he's just dying to find someone
to take it out on.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.083
Hey, guys. This isn't a hockey rink.
Can you take it outside?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.291
Hi, honey. How was your day?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.542
I didn't get the VP gig.

07:03.625 --> 07:07.166
Oh, Tom, I am so sorry.

07:07.291 --> 07:10.500
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'm Peterson's "go-to guy".

07:10.625 --> 07:13.917
How does Tim Duggan,
the biggest blowhard in the office,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.375
get promoted to vice president over me?

07:16.458 --> 07:18.500
I thought you liked Tim Duggan?

07:18.625 --> 07:23.000
I do. I just... I don't know,
I just, I really wanted that promotion.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.625
Hey, boys,
take the Stanley Cup finals outside.

07:30.291 --> 07:33.542
Did you tell Mr. Peterson
that you wanted the job?

07:33.625 --> 07:35.834
I have worked there for 8½ years.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.458
Duggan's been there two.
I am not gonna beg.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.250
I'm not saying to beg. You just
have to step up from time to time.

07:42.333 --> 07:47.250
See your opportunity and take it.
Nobody respects a shrinking violet.

07:47.333 --> 07:52.542
There is more than one leadership style.
Mine is quiet but effective.

07:52.667 --> 07:55.500
Take that racket outside.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.750
Whatever works for you.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.166
Susan.

08:06.291 --> 08:10.250
Hey, sexy. Where you been?
I called you twice. You avoiding me?

08:10.333 --> 08:15.417
Why would I do that? No,
I've been really busy grocery shopping.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.417
For two days?
You must be pretty well stocked.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.750
How about dinner tonight?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.667
Dinner tonight?

08:29.750 --> 08:31.291
You OK?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.083
Can you hold these a sec?

08:39.750 --> 08:42.250
Up against the car.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.750
You have the right to remain silent.

08:46.875 --> 08:50.125
Anything you do say can be
used against you in a court of law.

08:50.208 --> 08:54.875
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

09:00.166 --> 09:04.667
So get this. Zach Young's throwing
a pool party Saturday night.

09:04.750 --> 09:08.208
He sent out formal invitations
complete with fancy lettering.

09:08.291 --> 09:10.750
I thought he'd spritz them
with aftershave.

09:10.875 --> 09:15.125
- What is wrong with nice invitations?
- Mom, it's a pool party.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.333
He could've just passed out flyers.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.458
He's genetically incapable
of being cool.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.959
So, are you going?

09:23.083 --> 09:29.959
Maybe. I mean, Lisa and Justin and some
of the guys thought it'd be fun to swim.

09:30.083 --> 09:32.750
We can always bail if it's lame.

09:32.875 --> 09:36.083
Is Lisa your friend
with the pierced navel?

09:36.208 --> 09:37.583
Yeah.

09:37.709 --> 09:40.917
You've been spending
a lot of time together lately.

09:41.041 --> 09:42.875
I guess.

09:44.333 --> 09:49.166
Andrew, I'm gonna want you home by 11
on Saturday.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.417
11? Mom, it's not even a school night.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.500
Bree, a curfew isn't gonna do any good.

09:56.375 --> 10:00.041
You may be able to abdicate
all your parental responsibility,

10:00.166 --> 10:02.667
but I cannot.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.458
What's going on here?

10:08.709 --> 10:11.500
Is this to do with the condom
you left in my room?

10:11.625 --> 10:14.792
As a matter of fact, it is.
And just so we're clear,

10:14.875 --> 10:17.625
if you get Lisa pregnant,
you will marry her.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.208
Andrew, this is not funny.

10:22.291 --> 10:25.125
Mom, trust me.
This is very funny.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.583
Mostly because
the condom wasn't mine.

10:39.041 --> 10:41.125
You suck, you know that?

10:50.375 --> 10:52.458
So obviously we need to talk.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.750
I'm still a virgin,
if you want to know.

10:56.834 --> 11:00.417
Well, good. But why on earth
would you need a condom?

11:00.500 --> 11:04.208
I'm planning on having sex
and don't want to get pregnant.

11:04.291 --> 11:06.792
You are president
of the Abstinence Club.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.667
I wasn't planning on
running for a second term.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.291
Who were you
planning on having sex with?

11:12.375 --> 11:15.333
- John.
- I thought you broke up with him.

11:15.417 --> 11:18.458
No. He broke up with me
because I wouldn't do it.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.834
If that's the type he is,
good riddance.

11:20.917 --> 11:23.750
Mom, every boy
at my school is that type.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.792
And besides, it's different with John.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.500
I love him.

11:31.417 --> 11:35.166
Sweetheart,
just because you give a boy sex

11:35.250 --> 11:38.458
doesn't mean you'll get love in return.

11:38.542 --> 11:42.417
So maybe I'm being stupid.
What's the big deal? It's just sex.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.250
I am looking out for your happiness.

11:46.333 --> 11:50.000
I understand what it's like
to be young and feel urges.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.417
But I waited until I got married.
As did your father.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.875
And it was so much better.

11:55.959 --> 11:59.291
But Daddy ended up cheating on you.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.000
Yes. Well...

12:01.083 --> 12:03.375
Now he's moved back,
you're miserable.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.458
- Why would you say that?
- The walls are paper thin.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.417
I hear more stuff
than I probably should.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.625
Look, Mom, I love you a lot,

12:12.750 --> 12:18.208
but you're the last person to give
anyone advice about sex and happiness.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.709
You seen these?
Five more Past Due notices.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.458
- I'm handling it.
- How are you handling it?

12:30.625 --> 12:32.375
Can I finish my sandwich?

12:32.458 --> 12:34.834
Have you seen our account?
We're broke.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.792
We have the mortgage payment
coming up...

12:37.959 --> 12:40.333
Gaby, it's gonna be OK.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.458
No, it's not. We are screwed.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.375
I am freaking out
that you're not freaking out.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.500
- Things will turn around.
- When?

12:47.625 --> 12:52.458
I don't know when. But we're
lucky people. And we'll be lucky again.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.834
- What is that?
- It's the lawn mower.

12:57.917 --> 13:00.834
We got a new gardener today.

13:00.959 --> 13:04.000
It won't cost us a cent.
The kid's a friend of John's.

13:04.125 --> 13:08.333
- Carlos...
- He said he'd do the lawn for free.

13:09.166 --> 13:14.125
Can you believe it?
We are lucky people.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.208
- Hey, Duggan. You're up, baby.
- You got it.

13:26.291 --> 13:28.542
- Yeah, Duggan.
- Let’s go, man.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.458
Hey, guys,
good to see you again.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.125
Don't look so glum.
You'll get a hit.

13:37.208 --> 13:40.959
It's not that.
This is my "hating Tim Duggan" look.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.834
- Duggan connects.
- There.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.917
Look at that job-stealing bastard run.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.959
Duggan is showing
some of that glory-hounding,

13:53.083 --> 13:56.000
ass-kissing hustle
that he is so well-known for.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.917
I forgot how much fun you are
when you're bitter.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.417
He's stretching for extra bases.
like he stretched for extra territory,

14:03.542 --> 14:07.125
screwing over unsung utility player,
Tom Scavo.

14:07.208 --> 14:12.542
Down goes Duggan.
Duggan goes down. That's gotta hurt.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.667
The glory-hound is tagged out,

14:14.792 --> 14:17.667
and he's gonna have to deal
with tough dirt stains.

14:17.750 --> 14:18.792
Tom...

14:21.542 --> 14:24.041
No, I'm sure he's just grandstanding.

14:27.709 --> 14:29.625
Oh, my God.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.792
Holy crap.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.166
- It's only a pool party.
- I said no.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.583
Are you gonna keep a boy-free zone
around me until I'm 18?

14:42.709 --> 14:46.125
You can see boys,
in a couple years, just not that boy.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.291
Why do you hate Zach?

14:48.417 --> 14:51.917
I don't hate Zach.
I just think he's sort of crazy.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.166
People call you "sort of crazy".

14:54.250 --> 14:57.417
I'm adorable crazy.
And he's rampage crazy.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.125
- Susan Mayer?
- Yeah?

15:03.250 --> 15:07.500
I'm Detective Copeland, investigating
the murder of Martha Huber.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.917
I need to talk to you
about Mike Delfino.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.375
Do you remember seeing Mr. Delfino
on the 7th of last month?

15:14.417 --> 15:16.500
Is the 7th important?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.792
We believe it was the night
that Martha Huber was murdered.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.208
She was seen
at the grocery store at nine.

15:22.291 --> 15:25.709
She didn't show for
a dentist appointment the next morning.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.875
- What day was that?
- It was a Sunday.

15:27.959 --> 15:30.500
Oh, my God. Yes.

15:31.959 --> 15:34.041
I was with Mike that night.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.542
- You're sure?
- Yes.

15:35.625 --> 15:40.834
It was a big night, relationship-wise.
It was the first time that we...

15:40.917 --> 15:44.875
- The first time you...?
- Did it. The first time they did it.

15:44.959 --> 15:46.542
- Julie.
- It was.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.917
- How did you know?
- I'm not clueless.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.750
- Men's boxers in the clothes hamper.
- Don't write that down.

15:53.834 --> 15:56.000
This is good.
You can let Mike go.

15:56.125 --> 15:59.583
Assuming everything you're telling me
is true.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.750
It's true.

16:00.834 --> 16:05.166
The next morning she made pancakes
in the shape of little hearts.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.208
Seriously, little hearts.

16:15.792 --> 16:19.166
God.
Justin. What are you doing up here?

16:20.000 --> 16:24.542
I finished the hedges. Is there
anything else Mr. Solis wants done?

16:24.667 --> 16:27.625
He's not here.
He had a meeting with his lawyer.

16:27.709 --> 16:30.083
So that means we're all alone.

16:30.166 --> 16:32.625
No. I'm all alone. You're leaving.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.750
I'm not in a hurry.

16:34.834 --> 16:38.417
- We could hang out for a while.
- I don't think so.

16:38.583 --> 16:42.667
Come on. If you just got to know me,
you'd see I can be lots of fun.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.083
All my friends say so.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.709
I'm not one of your friends.
Get out of my bedroom.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.917
Come on, Mrs. Solis. Be nice.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.667
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Do you know how easy it would be

17:00.750 --> 17:03.542
for me to tell my husband
what you tried to do?

17:03.625 --> 17:07.959
Not as easy as it'd be for me
to tell him about you and John.

17:08.041 --> 17:10.208
I'm sorry, Mrs. Solis,

17:11.333 --> 17:14.291
but you're gonna
have to be nice to me,

17:14.375 --> 17:17.083
at least once.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.000
Mike.

17:33.709 --> 17:36.291
Mike. Are you OK?

17:36.417 --> 17:39.583
Yeah. I'm a little bit embarrassed.

17:39.667 --> 17:43.750
- Must be the talk of the neighborhood.
- No. Not really.

17:43.834 --> 17:46.667
So guess what? I'm your alibi.

17:46.750 --> 17:51.625
I told the police we were together
the night Mrs. Huber was killed

17:51.709 --> 17:55.250
and that
I could never forget that night.

17:55.333 --> 17:59.667
- You don't think I killed Mrs. Huber?
- No, of course not.

17:59.750 --> 18:04.959
I could never think you killed anybody,
even if I wasn't your alibi. Which I am.

18:05.083 --> 18:11.041
OK. I'm gonna go take a shower.
Jail's kinda gross.

18:11.125 --> 18:14.500
- I'll call you later. OK?
- Sure. When?

18:16.875 --> 18:21.000
Later. I just got some stuff
I gotta take care of. OK?

18:26.959 --> 18:29.041
- Mrs. Van De Kamp.
- Hello, John.

18:29.125 --> 18:32.500
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.
Do you have a moment?

18:32.583 --> 18:33.709
Sure.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.375
So what can I do for you?

18:39.458 --> 18:43.208
Well, my daughter is
planning on giving you her virginity

18:43.291 --> 18:46.834
and I would consider it a favor
if you wouldn't take it.

18:52.417 --> 18:56.083
- Hey.
- Hey. So what's the word on Tim?

18:56.166 --> 18:59.542
He came through the triple bypass
with flying colors.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.709
Thank God.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.667
It's not all coming up roses.

19:03.750 --> 19:07.959
He’s not gonna be able to come back
to work for four-and-a-half months.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.625
What?

19:12.709 --> 19:14.750
Company still needs to expand,

19:14.834 --> 19:19.750
so they need a fit, heart-smart guy
like me to step up, take the ball.

19:19.834 --> 19:22.500
- You're going after his promotion?
- No.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.041
I already got it.
You should have seen me.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.709
I walked straight into Peterson's office

19:27.792 --> 19:31.166
and told him he would be a fool
to hold Duggan's promotion.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.458
- You called your boss a fool?
- I did.

19:34.542 --> 19:38.250
That was risky in retrospect.
But still he gave me the job.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.041
- Oh, my God. That's great.
- Honey, it's me.

19:41.125 --> 19:45.125
- I got the whole west coast.
- Oh, my... What?

19:45.208 --> 19:48.583
I thought you were going after
an in-house position.

19:48.667 --> 19:52.500
No. I'm setting up new offices
from Seattle to LA. I told you that.

19:52.583 --> 19:53.959
No.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.750
No, you didn't.

19:57.875 --> 20:02.125
OK. Well, so it's gonna be
a little bit more travel, but...

20:02.208 --> 20:05.208
Tom, you're barely here
half the time as it is.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.333
Now you're gonna have,
what, twice the workload?

20:08.417 --> 20:10.625
Honey, please don't ruin this.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.834
You should have consulted with me.

20:12.917 --> 20:16.000
I did. You told me
to stop being a shrinking violet.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.750
I thought
this was an in-house position.

20:20.542 --> 20:22.208
OK, I'm gonna go shower.

20:22.291 --> 20:25.291
Look, wait.
I know what this means to you.

20:25.417 --> 20:28.583
No, you don't. I am 41 years old.

20:28.667 --> 20:32.458
If I don't make vice president now,
it's never gonna happen.

20:32.542 --> 20:35.250
This is my career.
It's important to me.

20:36.417 --> 20:39.333
So was mine. But I'm here, aren't I?

20:42.583 --> 20:44.667
I'm gonna take the job.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.500
She said you broke up with her
because she refused to have sex.

20:58.792 --> 21:02.875
OK, here's the deal. I said that.
But it was just an excuse.

21:02.959 --> 21:06.458
I mean, the truth is,
I wasn't that into her.

21:07.542 --> 21:08.583
Really?

21:08.667 --> 21:11.375
She was always so proud
of never having done it,

21:11.458 --> 21:14.500
I figured, "Hey, this is my way out."

21:14.625 --> 21:17.500
Well, she feels
very passionately about you.

21:17.625 --> 21:24.041
Don't get me wrong. She's nice.
But the truth is, there's someone else.

21:25.542 --> 21:27.834
Are you going steady?

21:27.917 --> 21:32.542
Not exactly. We were seeing
each other pretty regularly,

21:32.667 --> 21:36.875
but this other lady... girl,
she sort of dumped me.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.125
I see.

21:41.041 --> 21:46.667
Look, I'll talk to Danielle, and
don't worry, I'll let her down gently.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.542
Actually, I would prefer if you didn't.

21:54.291 --> 21:57.000
I know my daughter.
She's very determined.

21:57.083 --> 22:01.083
Unless you're really firm with her,
she'll think there's hope.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.333
OK. I'll be firm.

22:04.542 --> 22:08.333
Better still, be brutal.

22:22.834 --> 22:27.333
- Decided to indulge your sweet tooth?
- I'll be dead inside a year.

22:27.417 --> 22:31.041
I've got bigger things to worry about
than my waistline.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.583
So, who's the woman
they think you killed?

22:33.709 --> 22:38.208
Martha Huber. Local busybody.
I thought her murder was random.

22:38.375 --> 22:42.333
Nothing random about her jewelry
ending up in your garage.

22:42.417 --> 22:44.250
Did you kill her?

22:44.333 --> 22:49.000
No. Whoever set me up did a good job.
The cops are all over me.

22:49.166 --> 22:52.834
- You're getting close to something.
- If I am close, I don't see it.

22:52.917 --> 22:58.250
People leave trails. One of those trails
will lead to Deirdre.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.417
Whoever set you up must know that.

23:00.542 --> 23:04.208
Maybe, but I won't
be much good to you locked up.

23:04.291 --> 23:08.333
I'm rich, Mike. One of the best things
about being rich

23:08.417 --> 23:12.417
is the security of knowing you can
buy your way out of any problem.

23:14.500 --> 23:21.083
I'm not taking my money to the grave.
I'm gonna use it to save your ass.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.625
- Mrs. Solis?
- Hello, Justin.

23:27.709 --> 23:31.834
- What are you doing here?
- I am here to talk to your roommate.

23:31.917 --> 23:35.709
John? I didn't think
you guys talked any more.

23:35.792 --> 23:39.083
Well, now we have something
to talk about. You.

23:39.166 --> 23:40.625
- Me?
- Yes.

23:40.834 --> 23:44.083
How you're trying to blackmail me
into sleeping with you.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.625
- I wonder how he'll react.
- Mrs. Solis...

23:46.750 --> 23:49.291
You think he'll get violent?

23:50.792 --> 23:54.166
- You can't talk to John about that.
- I can.

23:54.291 --> 23:57.625
And I will, you little worthless
piece of crap.

23:59.166 --> 24:02.291
Listen, Mrs. Solis, I'm sorry.

24:03.291 --> 24:06.750
- I didn't want to blackmail you.
- Then why did you?

24:06.834 --> 24:09.542
I really needed to sleep with you.

24:09.625 --> 24:11.458
- Why?
- Because...

24:15.625 --> 24:18.333
I think I might be gay.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.834
Daddy.

24:23.917 --> 24:26.041
How about that?

24:27.291 --> 24:31.333
- What's up?
- The boys knew you wouldn't be home

24:31.417 --> 24:37.542
till after bedtime, and so we decided
to pop in and visit the new VP.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.959
Check it out. I finally
got an office with a window.

24:41.041 --> 24:43.291
Yeah. It's all about the window.

24:45.750 --> 24:48.250
Hey, guys. Hey, who wants chair rides?

24:48.333 --> 24:51.959
- Me.
- Out this way. Here we go.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.792
Here we go, guys. Ready?

24:56.291 --> 24:58.291
Hold on.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.542
Checking out
the new executive digs?

25:03.709 --> 25:05.458
You know it.

25:08.875 --> 25:13.041
- Can I tell you a little secret?
- Sure.

25:13.125 --> 25:16.667
Dan wanted to hold
the promotion over for Tim Duggan.

25:16.750 --> 25:20.500
And I'm the one that convinced him
to give it to Tom.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.875
Really?

25:23.542 --> 25:27.875
Tom is such a workhorse
and he wanted it so badly.

25:27.959 --> 25:31.458
Yeah, he certainly did.

25:32.375 --> 25:36.417
What is wrong?
Aren't you happy about this promotion?

25:36.500 --> 25:41.875
<i>Lynette realized</i>
<i>it was best to lie to the boss' wife...</i>

25:41.959 --> 25:44.542
Well, it's great.

25:44.625 --> 25:47.250
Obviously. Thank you.

25:47.375 --> 25:50.333
<i>...provided she wasn't too convincing.</i>

25:50.417 --> 25:53.166
Of course, I mean,

25:53.250 --> 25:58.291
I will miss him
being gone all the time.

25:58.375 --> 26:02.750
He'll be bringing in more money,
but he is gonna miss the birthdays,

26:02.917 --> 26:09.625
baseball games, first steps.
But that's the trade-off. Right?

26:09.709 --> 26:15.750
I just hope one day Tom doesn't
look back and regret being gone so much.

26:18.041 --> 26:21.458
I better get out there
before they break something.

26:21.542 --> 26:24.041
- Of course. I will see you soon.
- OK.

26:30.083 --> 26:34.917
So, have you been
acting on these feelings?

26:36.959 --> 26:43.125
I got a buddy. We get together.
Mess around. But it's no big deal.

26:43.208 --> 26:47.125
It's just lately, I've been
starting to care about him

26:47.208 --> 26:49.458
and I don't know how to handle it.

26:50.792 --> 26:53.542
And I thought
if I sleep with somebody like you,

26:53.625 --> 26:58.250
I'll know for sure and
I can stop freaking out about this.

26:58.333 --> 27:03.041
But why me? You're a good-looking kid.
Why not test drive someone your own age?

27:03.333 --> 27:10.333
Girls talk. If I start something with
somebody and it doesn't work out,

27:10.417 --> 27:12.500
everybody at school will find out.

27:12.583 --> 27:16.291
And I figured I can trust you,
'cause you have a husband and all.

27:16.375 --> 27:21.625
Well, I guess that makes sense
in a weird sort of way.

27:23.875 --> 27:28.917
You know, my buddy and I have been
messing around for quite a while,

27:29.000 --> 27:31.959
and this whole time
I kept telling myself

27:32.041 --> 27:35.709
that it didn't really mean anything,
you know?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.917
Guess I've been kidding myself, huh?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.208
We're all in denial
about something.

27:46.250 --> 27:51.875
But you're finally facing the truth,
and I think that's sort of brave.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.709
- Thanks.
- I should probably go.

27:59.333 --> 28:04.125
Just so you know, I never would
have told Mr. Solis about you and John.

28:04.208 --> 28:08.417
I may be gay but I'm not a jerk.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.417
Did you feel anything?

28:28.917 --> 28:30.750
Not really.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.125
You're definitely gay.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.917
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry to bother you at night,

28:49.041 --> 28:54.375
but I was hoping that you could come
to the station to answer more questions.

28:54.458 --> 28:59.333
Now? Well, I'm sorry, my daughter
and I were gonna go see a movie tonight.

28:59.417 --> 29:03.834
Mom? We can do it another night.
I'll be fine.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.792
- Let me get my purse.
- Great.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.125
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.500
I won't be late.

29:26.959 --> 29:32.458
You said that Mike came to your house
around 10pm on the night of the seventh.

29:33.458 --> 29:37.333
- Should I talk into the camera or...
- No. Just talk to me.

29:37.417 --> 29:42.542
OK. Yes.
He came over around ten o'clock.

29:42.625 --> 29:46.792
Do you know of any tension
between Mike and Martha Huber?

29:46.917 --> 29:48.375
No.

29:48.458 --> 29:52.000
Were you aware
Mike was shot recently?

29:52.083 --> 29:54.542
Yes, on Valentine's Day.

29:54.625 --> 29:59.250
- Do you know how that came about?
- He dropped his gun, cleaning it.

29:59.375 --> 30:02.041
Ms Mayer,
I've been around guns for years.

30:02.166 --> 30:05.667
I've never seen one discharge
when it hits the ground.

30:05.750 --> 30:09.667
- Someone has to pull the trigger.
- I wouldn't know about that.

30:09.792 --> 30:13.542
Were you aware there was
a home invasion on Pine Avenue

30:13.625 --> 30:15.709
- the day before Valentine's?
- No.

30:15.792 --> 30:19.333
The intruder was shot in the stomach.
Where was Mike's wound?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.959
The stomach.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.667
Do you love him?

30:32.750 --> 30:34.834
What?

30:36.166 --> 30:38.166
What does that have to do with... ?

30:38.250 --> 30:41.542
Sometimes people do stupid things
when they’re in love.

30:41.625 --> 30:45.875
I should know.
I've been married four times.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.625
Tell me the truth.
He wasn't with you that night.

30:49.750 --> 30:52.625
- He asked you to lie for him.
- No, he didn't.

30:52.709 --> 30:56.709
He was with me. And Mike
wouldn't kill anybody. I'm sure of that.

31:08.834 --> 31:12.792
Mike Delfino: convicted 1987.

31:12.875 --> 31:16.750
Did five-and-a-half years
for drug trafficking and manslaughter.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.375
<i>You want a coffee?</i>
<i>I'm gonna go for a coffee.</i>

31:44.625 --> 31:48.041
Is she covering for her guy?

31:48.959 --> 31:51.583
No. She's just a sucker.

32:03.375 --> 32:06.917
I guess no one's in the pool yet.
Are you gonna swim?

32:07.000 --> 32:11.417
Please, I just spent an hour
blowing out my hair.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.542
Good luck, man.

32:15.208 --> 32:18.333
I'll see you later. OK?

32:24.792 --> 32:29.333
Hey, I got a surprise for you.
You wanna go somewhere and talk?

32:29.417 --> 32:32.583
Yeah. We should talk.

32:32.667 --> 32:36.500
- Hi. You made it.
- Andrew's here. Didn't think he'd come.

32:36.583 --> 32:41.458
Yeah, he brought his friends. They're
acting like jerks. Alert the media.

32:41.542 --> 32:45.291
I don't care. You're here now.
This is gonna be great.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.375
Come on, man. Let's go.

32:50.667 --> 32:53.834
- Danielle.
- Don't touch me.

32:53.917 --> 32:56.333
Hope you can swim.

32:59.834 --> 33:02.125
- Could you take it easy?
- It's cool.

33:02.208 --> 33:04.333
Look, he floats.

33:04.417 --> 33:08.709
All right? Relax. It's a party.
You're the main party animal, right?

33:08.834 --> 33:11.417
Am I right?

33:11.542 --> 33:12.583
I guess.

33:12.667 --> 33:16.000
All right. Well, then act like it.
Come on, give me a howl.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.959
Come on. You're the host.
Revel in it. Gimme a howl.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.208
There you go.

33:38.041 --> 33:42.750
- You OK?
- What do I care? He's nothing.

33:42.834 --> 33:45.333
I could take care of him if I wanted to.

33:45.417 --> 33:47.792
How do you mean?

33:47.875 --> 33:50.792
I know where my mom kept her gun.

34:01.333 --> 34:05.959
- That's not funny, Zach.
- If you think about it, yeah, it is.

34:11.792 --> 34:13.250
Julie.

34:17.583 --> 34:20.875
Hey. Danielle, are you OK?

34:20.959 --> 34:24.542
I just want to go home. Can we go?

34:25.709 --> 34:26.750
Sure.

34:30.041 --> 34:32.083
Julie.

34:33.208 --> 34:35.291
I'm taking Danielle home.

34:35.417 --> 34:38.500
- Are you coming back?
- I don't think so.

35:01.375 --> 35:04.875
So, how was the PTA meeting?

35:04.959 --> 35:07.000
Long.

35:11.291 --> 35:14.375
So, Peterson called me
into his office today.

35:14.458 --> 35:15.667
Really?

35:15.750 --> 35:18.041
Yeah. He changed his mind.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.625
He's gonna hold that promotion
for Duggan.

35:23.125 --> 35:24.792
Yeah. It's fine.

35:24.875 --> 35:28.500
I'm glad, really.
I didn't want to work those long hours.

35:28.583 --> 35:33.458
And you know how I hate flying.
It does horrible things to my back.

35:33.542 --> 35:37.709
With all that extra stress,
I would have ended up like Tim Duggan

35:37.792 --> 35:40.166
ten years from now. So...

35:43.709 --> 35:45.333
Yeah. Of course.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.500
So it's over.

35:49.500 --> 35:52.000
You'll make VP one of these days.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.750
It's OK. Honest.

35:55.333 --> 35:58.750
I am really glad
that it worked out this way.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.250
Oh, God. You scared me.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.458
How'd it go?

36:28.166 --> 36:30.208
It went just peachy.

36:31.709 --> 36:34.083
And humiliating and shocking.

36:34.834 --> 36:36.959
- Susan...
- How could you?

36:37.750 --> 36:41.083
God, "Susan, do you trust me?"
"Of course I do."

36:41.166 --> 36:44.125
I'm such an idiot.
And you're such a liar.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.959
And apparently a killer
and a drug dealer.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.625
That's quite a personal ad
you've got going.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.166
- I came to Wisteria Lane...
- Stop, Mike.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.375
Just stop.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.834
If you keep talking,

36:57.917 --> 37:01.917
you're gonna work your way
into my heart,

37:02.000 --> 37:07.709
and I just don't want you
anywhere near my heart.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.500
Ever.

37:16.583 --> 37:17.667
Julie?

37:20.542 --> 37:22.625
Mommy needs a hug.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.667
Is Julie in there? Julie Mayer?

37:47.792 --> 37:50.625
I don’t know.
It's pretty dead in there.

37:58.417 --> 38:00.250
Julie Alexandra Mayer.

38:01.959 --> 38:07.333
Julie. Zach, this is ridiculous.
You can't hold your breath for ever.

38:13.250 --> 38:16.834
You might as well stay under there
and never come up for air,

38:16.917 --> 38:21.000
'cause when you do, I'm gonna choke
the living daylights out of you.

38:25.291 --> 38:27.834
Is my daughter under there?

38:36.000 --> 38:41.333
- I'm not gay.
- OK. I'm sorry.

38:42.792 --> 38:46.375
I'll just...
I'm just gonna leave those right there.

38:48.208 --> 38:50.834
I'm fine. It's good.
You just, you know...

38:54.041 --> 38:56.875
Did you see... ?
No. Goodbye.

39:02.375 --> 39:04.542
Sell the house?
Are you crazy?

39:04.625 --> 39:06.667
We can't afford to live here.

39:06.750 --> 39:10.458
If the Justice Department
unfreezes the bank accounts...

39:10.542 --> 39:12.625
Then what?

39:12.709 --> 39:17.458
We have tons of legal bills. And even
with our savings, we're screwed.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.291
- It's our house.
- I love this place too. It's just...

39:27.375 --> 39:29.959
It's time for us to face the music.

39:52.083 --> 39:55.834
I never thought I'd be poor
at this stage of my life.

39:57.917 --> 40:02.542
You know, Carlos, I've been broke
a lot of times in my life.

40:02.625 --> 40:06.917
But I've never been poor.
Because poor is just a state of mind.

40:08.250 --> 40:11.000
And right now, you and I are just...

40:11.083 --> 40:14.083
Without funds?

40:14.166 --> 40:15.583
Exactly.

40:20.166 --> 40:24.000
I guess we could
get an apartment, start over.

40:25.667 --> 40:28.750
Who knows? It might even be fun.

40:31.667 --> 40:37.834
And once we're back on our feet,
we'll get a house as big as this one.

40:38.792 --> 40:40.792
Bigger.

40:55.792 --> 41:00.750
I get my wife this dog for her birthday.
Stray from the pound.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.959
She loves it. So I'm a genius.

41:03.041 --> 41:06.291
Then I find out it's got
this weird blood disease.

41:06.375 --> 41:11.291
Now I'm laying out $600 a month
for doggie medicine. Am I a genius?

41:11.375 --> 41:15.667
Don't be cynical. You did something
nice. You made your wife happy.

41:15.792 --> 41:20.667
Now, let's talk
about what's gonna make you happy.

41:28.041 --> 41:30.667
<i>Yes, each new day in suburbia</i>

41:30.750 --> 41:34.083
<i>brings with it a new set of lies.</i>

41:34.166 --> 41:39.709
<i>The worst are the ones we tell ourselves</i>
<i>before we fall asleep.</i>

41:39.792 --> 41:44.917
<i>We whisper them in the dark,</i>
<i>telling ourselves we're happy.</i>

41:46.625 --> 41:50.083
<i>Or, that he's happy.</i>

41:53.750 --> 41:55.875
<i>That we can change.</i>

41:59.083 --> 42:01.875
<i>Or that he will change his mind.</i>

42:07.125 --> 42:10.709
<i>We persuade ourselves</i>
<i>we can live with our sins</i>

42:20.125 --> 42:23.291
<i>or that we can live without him.</i>

42:25.250 --> 42:31.041
<i>Yes, each night before we fall asleep</i>
<i>we lie to ourselves,</i>

42:31.125 --> 42:36.417
<i>in the desperate, desperate hope,</i>
<i>that come morning,</i>

42:36.542 --> 42:38.750
<i>it will all be true.</i>
