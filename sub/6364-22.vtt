Almost cost us the entire case.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.471
I'm bumping you back down
to uniform.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.541
You wanted to see us, sergeant?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.609
Burgess, you're in intelligence
till further notice.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.777
How you holding up?

00:11.779 --> 00:14.546
Same as everyone else,
i guess.

00:14.548 --> 00:17.116
Don't let this turn into
a banana peel for you.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.617
You know what
i'm talking about.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.253
Times like this, you need
to be around family.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.655
I'm so sorry
you lost your friend.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.226
I didn't lose her.
I got her killed.

You turned off the alarm
on my phone?

01:10.571 --> 01:13.072
I let you sleep in.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.706
You tampered with my phone.

[bunny scoffs]

01:16.177 --> 01:18.243
(bunny)
everything's a conspiracy
with you.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.845
"tampered."

01:19.847 --> 01:22.448
You tied one on last night
and i let you sleep in.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.553
You know, it was
really nice,

01:27.555 --> 01:29.521
You talking about
what's on your mind.

01:29.523 --> 01:33.492
But...What happened to nadia
is truly terrible,

01:33.494 --> 01:37.329
And if you want to talk
about it, i am so here for you.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.265
Whatever i said
last night,

01:40.267 --> 01:41.533
Chalk it up
to a whiskey neat.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.235
This coffee is insane.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.870
Did you heat it
with a flamethrower?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.307
Never complained before.

01:48.308 --> 01:50.408
I guess my tastes have
changed since middle school.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.778
It's late.
I've got to go, but thank you.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.346
You're not gonna
eat anything?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.481
You are tiny.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.549
Maybe next time.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.867
Sergeant, a little help here?

02:14.869 --> 02:16.168
How's that, burgess?

02:16.170 --> 02:17.369
The palm scanner didn't work.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.570
I filled out the thing.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.672
That is not my concern.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.408
Sorry, i can't really see you.
Did you say something or--

02:23.410 --> 02:24.843
No.
Call up.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.345
Sergeant, i don't
call up anymore.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.713
I scan in.

02:27.715 --> 02:28.914
And yet.

02:28.916 --> 02:33.252
Darlin', hey...
Your voice really carries.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.255
Um.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.891
Hey, so, listen, i know
you know the drill up there

02:38.893 --> 02:40.359
And everything,
but it's your first day.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.327
You're gonna love it.
Just keep your head down.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.579
Do the work.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.830
Don't try and
draw attention to yourself.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.898
He kind of hates that.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.366
What, are you afraid
to say his name?

02:47.368 --> 02:48.700
No, i'm not afraid
to say his name--

02:48.702 --> 02:49.801
Multiple shots fired
at lakeshore sports and fitness.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.470
We gotta go.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.673

02:54.675 --> 02:58.677

03:10.457 --> 03:11.490
Uh-huh.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.558
Last shot fired
two minutes ago.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.759
Shooters could
still be inside.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.828

balaclavas and tac gear.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.698
Swat and deputy are en route.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.500
- Should i initiate a plan 4?
- Yes.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.902
On my authority.
And contain this crowd.

Go! Go!

05:39.973 --> 05:42.341
I took a position
on the guy behind.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.675
I discharged
my weapon twice.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.944
- All right.
- He didn't fall.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.846
He swung his rifle on me.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.948
You id the guy yet?
Is he local?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.717
We're still
working on it.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.695
At 8:23 am,
four shooters entered

07:10.697 --> 07:11.897
The lakeshore sport and fitness
and started killing.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.465
We have
four confirmed dead males

07:13.467 --> 07:15.534
And one female vic
in surgery at chicago med.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.068
Now we have one shooter
in custody.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.470
He remains unidentified.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.138
Three other shooters
are at large.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.207
The fbi is looking
for a terrorist link.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.843
Intelligence will be
coordinating the ground game.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.845
The fusion unit's
tapping area cameras.

07:26.847 --> 07:30.215
Air one is scanning rooftops.
Who here is cta?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.850
All right, stop all trains
out of state and lake.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.819
- And i need all buses rerouted.
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.738
- Cfd.
- Yeah?

07:35.739 --> 07:37.656
We need four ambos on standby
in case of another incident.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.458
Now, they burned
their suits and masks,

07:39.460 --> 07:41.560
So we don't know what
they look like right now.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.962
Patrolman spotted four guys
wearing all black

07:43.964 --> 07:45.597
Park a car two blocks east.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.132
Ran the plates,
car came back hot.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.969
Inside were 400 rounds
of m855s, armor piercing.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.538
All right, i'll redirect patrol
and set up a grid search.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.106
Move fast, move smart.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.108
Let's find these guys
and keep those ambos empty.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.477
All right.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.644
- Hey.
- Yeah?

07:59.646 --> 08:02.080
Um...Do you have
an extra shirt in your car?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.949
I didn't get a chance
to run home.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.750
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.086
Am i the last one to say
welcome to intelligence?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.522
The first, actually.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.524
Crazy day.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.193
What's up, burgess?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.796
Hey.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.967
I pieced this together.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.768
It's the bad guys' route
through the club.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.104
Now you see how fast
they clear that space?

08:26.106 --> 08:29.774
They cover every avenue,
every point of domination.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.910
And they go down the stairs...

08:32.913 --> 08:34.212
Send everyone running...

08:34.214 --> 08:36.081
But they don't fire
a single shot

08:36.082 --> 08:39.251
Until this guy
gets in their way.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.119
Then they don't hesitate.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.289
Single shot to the head.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.558
Now, let me ask,
what's this look like to you?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.193
- Their formation.
- It looks military to me.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.695
Yeah.
That's where we lose 'em.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.031
No eyes on the squash courts.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.134
[suspenseful music]

08:56.136 --> 08:59.137
These guys, they throw
wild shots into one court.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.805
[camera shutter clicking]

09:00.807 --> 09:02.240
Then three hits over here.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.976
[camera clicking]

09:04.978 --> 09:08.046
One, two, three.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.985
Three shots,
three bodies.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.787
This isn't random.

09:15.789 --> 09:18.690
¶ ¶

09:18.692 --> 09:20.625
(nick)
i was here on
my friend's guest pass.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.561
She, um...

09:22.563 --> 09:25.330
She was one of the ones...
Who...

09:25.332 --> 09:28.333
She's got the best doctors
in the city working on her.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.868
She's gonna be fine.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.606
It's okay if
you need a minute.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.242
I'm good.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.578
You were on your way
to the locker room.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.716
When they came up...
Four of them.

09:44.718 --> 09:48.219
Sh--she panicked and...

09:48.221 --> 09:50.288
And they shot her.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.791
Just 'cause she was
in the way.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.928
We'll need to test you
for gunshot residue.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.297
It's just a formality.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.999
And then they came down
to my court.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.667
To court five.

10:02.669 --> 10:03.768
Directly across from court two?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.370
That's right.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.773
And then he opened the door
and he just started shooting.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.143
I dove to the ground.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.679
When i looked up, i could still
see into the other court.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.781
- Into court two?
- Yes.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.718
It was...

10:19.720 --> 10:21.119
Hey, hey.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.721
It was awful
and i just keep seeing it.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.724
I--i'm sorry.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.693
[somber music]

10:28.695 --> 10:31.730
We were supposed
to have lunch together.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.731
You knew the victims?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.699
Um, we worked together

10:34.701 --> 10:37.202
At elkarn and associates.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.638
We're a law firm.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.140
They were senior partners.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.778
Well, what do you got?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.748
Well, we ran the, uh,
unknown offender's prints

10:49.750 --> 10:52.384
Through ncic.
He's not in the system.

10:52.386 --> 10:53.752
We thought these guys
were army,

10:53.754 --> 10:54.986
But i struck out there, too.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.021
Is he on a watch list?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.722
You know, homeland security?
Fbi?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.724
No, but something weirder
popped.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.826
See, his prints matched
a set lifted from a homicide

11:01.828 --> 11:03.695
Two days ago in
paoli, indiana.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.997
(ruzek)
the victim's name
was richard davis.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.867
He worked for lancaster chemical
as an engineer.

He was shot point blank.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.070
I got a call in to
the lead detective.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.339
Then today's shooting spree,
what's the nexus?

Yeah,

he was running late.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.751
The four lawyers,
they were targeted.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.587
We just don't know why yet.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.422
We still need to
identify these killers.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.257
Well, run them through
the indiana dmv

11:32.259 --> 11:33.892
If that's where
they came from.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.293
You know, snap a picture,

11:35.295 --> 11:36.428
Try and get a visual match.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.330
Maybe we can id them
that way.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.231
Yeah, mouse can't do
facial recognition.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.935
Not without official access
to the indiana dmv servers.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.337
Not legally anyway.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.773
Get it done.

Take a look.
There's no cameras in here.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.900
You can speak freely.
Really look at them.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.768
Davis stole trade secrets.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.637
Right.
And we know he signed

18:59.639 --> 19:03.207
A $2 million settlement
with lancaster chemical

19:03.209 --> 19:05.343
A week before
he was murdered.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.778
Managing partners found this
highly unusual.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.214
Why would you pay off
a thief who you just fired?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.782
And what did he
steal, exactly?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.317
Officers,
this settlement included

19:13.319 --> 19:15.553
A non-disclosure agreement.

Do you understand
that the men who did this

19:18.458 --> 19:20.558
Are holding hostages
right now?

19:20.560 --> 19:23.294
And more people
are gonna die.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.663
So what is going on?
What the hell are you hiding?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.766
This is an emotional day
for all of us,

19:28.768 --> 19:29.867
But to suggest
that my company

19:29.869 --> 19:31.202
Has anything to do
with what's happened--

19:31.204 --> 19:32.987
You've said enough, mark.

If you'll excuse us,

still doing here?

He called the engineer
11 times in the weeks

Leading up to his murder.

We know about
lancaster chemical.

But the last shooter's
in the wind.

28:23.151 --> 28:24.867
No, there never was
a third shooter here.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.939
They were playing us
the whole time.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.041
So where the hell
is he?

28:31.043 --> 28:34.144
¶ ¶

28:42.021 --> 28:44.922
So, area central id'd our
third shooter as ray kozelek.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.458
He's evan and owen's brother.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.993
(lindsay)
he's got priors for battery,
illegally concealing a handgun.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.762
Up until today,
he was the bad egg.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.263
Owen's a former marine,

28:53.265 --> 28:55.199
Served everywhere
from kosovo to kuwait.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.434
We think he probably
trained the family for this.

28:57.436 --> 28:58.769
So we got
these two in custody.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.204
Our last shooter's
still out there.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.840
Well, if it's a family affair,

29:02.842 --> 29:03.841
Let's shake the tree.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.476
Maybe another kozelek falls out.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.277
It's a...
It's a big tree.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.812
Look, i pulled
the brother's financials,

29:08.814 --> 29:10.364
Looked into known associates,

29:10.365 --> 29:11.915
Anyone who would make sense
as a co-conspirator.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.151
A list of siblings,
aunts, uncles, and cousins.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.536
I mean, it's a mile long.

29:15.537 --> 29:16.920
They're like jackrabbits,
the kozeleks.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.155
(olinsky)
well, get indiana state police

29:18.157 --> 29:19.523
To account for
every one of these folks.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.391
Wait.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.193
This guy.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.528
Nick sutter.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.497
He was there,
at the athletic club.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.165
We took a statement
from him.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.366
He was with
the woman who got shot.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.367
He was a witness.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.770
He was posing as one.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.104
I cleared him.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.273
Nicholas sutter is ray's son.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.876
He goes by his stepdad's name.
19 years old, no priors.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.478
So his cousin is
the little girl who died.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.913
(burgess)
i followed protocol.
I had him swabbed

29:42.915 --> 29:44.848
For gunshot residue.
Came back clean.

29:44.850 --> 29:45.849
I cannot believe this.

29:45.851 --> 29:46.850
I mean, we had him.

29:46.852 --> 29:48.252

Davis wasn't the enemy.

Davis was an employee.

Internal communications.

No. I was at
the jewel on des plaines,

40:45.977 --> 40:47.977
And this guy
comes up to me,

40:47.979 --> 40:51.114
Arms outstretched,
saying, "remember me?"

40:51.116 --> 40:53.783

from down the street?

Mm-hmm.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.793
He used to try to pick a fight
with me every day after school.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.228
He bit me once.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.997
