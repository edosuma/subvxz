and not only
because of my beard.

07:31.589 --> 07:33.107
I think my anxiety sent me home.

07:33.211 --> 07:34.868
I got overwhelmed too easily.

07:34.971 --> 07:36.801
But I'm a lot more
level headed now.

07:36.904 --> 07:38.285
Is there a red carpet?

07:38.388 --> 07:40.114
I always deserve a red carpet.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.184
Watch out, bitches.

07:41.288 --> 07:44.325
This is not the same
Nick as last time.

07:53.403 --> 07:54.715
Good to see you.

07:54.819 --> 07:56.993
I'm really looking forward toseeing some of the other people

07:57.097 --> 07:58.167
from my season.

07:58.270 --> 07:59.720
You know, I do want
to see Michelle, though.

07:59.824 --> 08:01.135
I do.
I love Michelle so much.

08:02.654 --> 08:05.139
I love her, although I feellike there's definitely people

08:05.243 --> 08:06.382
that I don't want to see.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.074
What do you think about Josh?

08:09.178 --> 08:11.145
Him and Josh
got into it a lot.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.837
Nick, he's a Suzy homemaker.

08:12.940 --> 08:13.907
You're a dick.

08:14.010 --> 08:15.460
You don't have the
balls to take over.

08:15.564 --> 08:16.461
Josh.

08:16.565 --> 08:17.773
And if you think
you could run 20.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.291
Stop [bleep]
talking over me, Josh.

08:19.395 --> 08:20.465
You're a [bleep] dick.

08:20.569 --> 08:21.673
I can't with them.

08:21.777 --> 08:23.364
This season,
we're all awesome.

08:23.468 --> 08:24.538
We're not going to do that shit.

08:24.642 --> 08:26.885
Yeah, all stars, no drama.

08:26.989 --> 08:28.059
I doubt that's going to happen.

08:28.162 --> 08:30.751
I think there's going
to be plenty of drama.

08:30.855 --> 08:31.856
Woo!

Oh, my god.

08:49.632 --> 08:50.460

08:51.669 --> 08:54.085
It's exciting to be
back in Hell's Kitchen.

08:54.188 --> 08:57.951
But based on my
last experience, I'm

08:58.054 --> 09:00.643
nervous because I
wasn't a favorite,

09:00.747 --> 09:04.267
like, the red team hated me.

09:04.371 --> 09:06.235
Like, we just flat out
just didn't get along.

09:09.514 --> 09:11.309
Come on, come on, come on.

replace my dome?

20:53.666 --> 20:54.494
Thanks.

20:54.598 --> 20:55.495
That would be great.

20:55.599 --> 20:57.670

reason why none of you

20:57.773 --> 20:59.465
have the ingredients
you were expecting.

20:59.568 --> 21:01.363
This is the all-star season.

21:33.257 --> 21:36.536
Oh, holy shit that's strong.

21:36.640 --> 21:37.641

21:47.133 --> 21:47.651
Seven minutes, Chef.

21:47.754 --> 21:48.617
Come on, Robyn.

21:48.721 --> 21:49.584

22:12.296 --> 22:13.470
GORDON RAMSAY: Ben,

22:13.573 --> 22:14.954
BEN: I'm going to be
doing a stuffed chicken

22:15.057 --> 22:18.060
breast with sauce of chickendemi, coconut, and fresh basil.

22:18.164 --> 22:19.510
Sounds delicious.

22:19.614 --> 22:22.444
BEN: When I was here for season5, I came at this like a bull

22:22.548 --> 22:23.480
in a china shop.

22:23.583 --> 22:24.826
You want to hear
something, dude?

22:24.929 --> 22:26.345
I was cooking
circles around you.

22:26.448 --> 22:28.208
I will circle you
like a [bleep] moon.

22:28.312 --> 22:29.969
- Where have you been?

22:30.072 --> 22:30.556
MAN: Hey, what, Ben?
What?

22:30.659 --> 22:31.488
Ben.

22:31.591 --> 22:33.248
You couldn't cook my [bleep].

22:33.352 --> 22:35.457
Come at it gung ho like
I did the first time.

22:35.561 --> 22:36.941
But it's easy to
sort of burn out.

22:37.045 --> 22:39.081
This time, I need to
really pace myself.

22:39.185 --> 22:41.498
I don't have any agenda
other than to win.

22:41.601 --> 22:42.878
Somebody had a
fucking mess over here.

22:42.982 --> 22:43.776

22:59.032 --> 23:01.310
I'll be judging you

23:01.414 --> 23:05.245
5 being the highest,
and 1, well, trust me.

23:05.349 --> 23:09.422
Anyone who gets 1, I
don't why you're here.

23:09.526 --> 23:10.389
Right.

23:10.492 --> 23:11.769

Since you've left
Hell's Kitchen,

23:26.370 --> 23:29.269

- Right.

23:32.790 --> 23:33.757
Well, great.

23:33.860 --> 23:35.828
If Ashley and Jared
are together again,

23:35.931 --> 23:37.105
they'll distract each other.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.763
And they'll fall apart again.

23:39.866 --> 23:41.212
I'm sorry I hurt you.

23:41.316 --> 23:43.456
It's really bad.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.631
Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:45.734 --> 23:46.528
[sigh]

23:47.564 --> 23:48.910
Let the canoodling begin.

23:49.013 --> 23:51.395
Right, Ash, let's
start off with you.

23:51.499 --> 23:52.948
Officially, it looks beautiful.

23:56.055 --> 23:57.643
GORDON RAMSAY:
Describe the dish.

23:57.746 --> 23:59.576
ASHLEY: The duck is
marinated in sake.

23:59.679 --> 24:01.750
And, underneath,
you have a Brussels

24:01.854 --> 24:05.236
sprout, celery-root puree.

24:05.340 --> 24:08.792
Ah, let's get one thing right,duck's nailed beautifully.

24:08.895 --> 24:11.173
But when you've got sauce thatdelicious, put less on there.

24:11.277 --> 24:13.935
Don't flush it.

24:14.038 --> 24:17.179
But it's a very strong start.

24:17.283 --> 24:18.353
4 out of 5.

the thing, the puree

24:38.684 --> 24:39.892
is a little bit watery.

24:39.995 --> 24:41.134
OK.

24:41.238 --> 24:43.309
But it's a-- you know,it's a very strong effort,

could send one of my
kids to more doctors

27:43.075 --> 27:43.869

What happens to aneggplant when it's crunchy?

28:31.433 --> 28:32.572
