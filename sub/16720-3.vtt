00:21.274 --> 00:24.924
Feel your uterus curl into
a smile as you stretch deeper

00:24.954 --> 00:26.438
into Crowning Otter.

00:28.019 --> 00:31.004
Ugh, Crowning Otter...
it's so graphic.

00:31.034 --> 00:33.063
Lin, why do you do
this prenatal yoga?

00:33.093 --> 00:34.573
You're... I mean,
you're not pregnant.

00:34.603 --> 00:35.886
Your youngest child is nine.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.451
I like it.

00:37.481 --> 00:39.595
It keeps my pelvic
floor perky. Ah!

00:39.625 --> 00:41.370
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.883
Hey, Mom, when you're done
polishing your pelvic floor,

00:43.913 --> 00:45.943
can you check
my math homework for me?

00:45.973 --> 00:46.982
There's nothing on here

00:47.012 --> 00:48.447
but a drawing of a robot.

00:48.477 --> 00:50.213
Who's better at math
than a robot?

00:50.243 --> 00:51.619
They're made of math.

00:51.649 --> 00:53.144
Oh, Mom, did you have a chance

00:53.174 --> 00:55.104
to finish reading
Buddy's Rainbow?

00:55.134 --> 00:58.077
- I did.
- The ending was so sad.

00:58.107 --> 01:00.329
Ah, this...
remind me how it ends.

01:00.359 --> 01:02.472
Buddy dies, poor doggie.

01:02.502 --> 01:03.779
Write it down.
Write it down.

01:03.809 --> 01:05.453
At least he saw the rainbow.

01:05.483 --> 01:06.960
Oh, he did?
Yeah.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.904
Louise, did you read
any of the book yourself?

01:08.934 --> 01:12.119
I could read it, but I retain it
better when Mom tells it to me.

01:12.149 --> 01:14.312
Lin, we've talked
about this a thousand times.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.262
You can't keep doing
the kids' homework for them.

01:16.294 --> 01:18.383
I'm not.
I'm helping them.

01:18.413 --> 01:19.973
What about you, Tina?

01:20.003 --> 01:21.733
Is your mother helping you
do your homework?

01:21.763 --> 01:23.122
No.
See?

01:23.152 --> 01:24.495
But Mom's been logging
her dreams

01:24.525 --> 01:26.337
in my dream journal
for English class.

01:26.367 --> 01:27.878
Great, you're dreaming for her.

01:27.908 --> 01:29.653
Oh, last night, I dreamt

01:29.683 --> 01:31.127
I was breast-feeding Gene again,

01:31.157 --> 01:33.136
and he had a long white
beard like Santa Claus.

01:33.166 --> 01:34.795
Oh, it was freaky.

01:34.825 --> 01:36.889
That could be
our next Christmas card.

01:36.919 --> 01:38.060
No.
Please.

01:38.090 --> 01:39.090
No.

01:42.077 --> 01:44.292
Well, Teddy, I finally did it.

01:44.322 --> 01:45.615
I got a soft serve machine.

01:45.645 --> 01:46.821
I knew you could do it, Bob.

01:46.851 --> 01:48.362
You just need to
believe in yourself.

01:48.392 --> 01:49.953
Yeah, and summer's coming.

01:49.983 --> 01:51.817
This thing is going
to be a gold mine.

02:09.979 --> 02:12.896
- Bobby, where'd you go?
- Huh?

02:12.926 --> 02:14.370
Stop daydreaming.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.600
- Let's have some of that ice cream.
- Okay, here we go.

02:16.633 --> 02:20.181
First bowl of a new era.

02:20.211 --> 02:22.810
- Oh, ugh, nasty.
- Give it here, give it here, give it here.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.699
Don't throw it out.
No, no, I wouldn't eat that.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.390
Just give it to me.
It's not ready yet.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.768
Give it to me.

02:27.798 --> 02:29.142
Ho-oh-oh.

02:29.172 --> 02:30.749
Wow, that is something there.

02:30.779 --> 02:32.558
As your first customer,
I can tell you,

02:32.588 --> 02:33.998
you don't change
a thing, you know.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.371
Teddy, you'll eat anything.

02:35.401 --> 02:37.381
What? I won't eat anything.
I'm pretty discerning.

02:37.411 --> 02:40.429
- Eat this.
- What was that?

02:40.459 --> 02:42.137
Don't feed a guy
a sponge, Bobby.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.415
Don't feed a guy a sponge.

02:44.445 --> 02:45.725
You put it in your mouth, Teddy.

02:48.696 --> 02:51.300
Louise, guess which one
of us ate cat food.

02:52.350 --> 02:53.927
Ugh, both of you.

02:53.957 --> 02:55.435
We brought it from home.

02:55.465 --> 02:57.277
See you in P.E. class.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.684
I'm sick of P.E.

02:58.714 --> 03:00.961
- So am I.
- Me, too.

03:00.991 --> 03:03.339
I hate the whole shirts
and skins thing.

03:03.369 --> 03:05.617
I'm not open! I'm not open!

03:05.647 --> 03:07.560
I hate Ms. Schroeder's
dumb rules.

03:07.590 --> 03:10.742
I told you, Louise,
no hats in P.E.

03:10.772 --> 03:14.929
And I told you, I have a raging
staph infection under here.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.905
Touch this hat
and we all go down.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.785
You want to play dodgeball
in the hospital?

03:19.815 --> 03:22.314
I hate how I always get hit
in the head with the ball.

03:22.344 --> 03:24.273
Ow.
Ow.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.065
Ow. Ow.

03:26.095 --> 03:27.455
I don't want to go
to P.E. anymore.

03:27.485 --> 03:28.913
Me, neither.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.537
Let's swing by Mr.
Frond's office.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.580
He's highly suggestible.

03:32.610 --> 03:35.963
You guys,
when I'm in P.E. class,

03:35.993 --> 03:37.538
I feel like I'm not living up

03:37.568 --> 03:39.815
to society's warped image
of fitness.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.708
I feel like a loser.

03:41.738 --> 03:44.136
I feel like I'm not being valued
as a woman.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.526
Me, neither.

03:45.556 --> 03:47.603
I need guidance and counselings.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.177
I'm a guidance counsellor.

03:49.207 --> 03:51.153
Come in.

03:51.183 --> 03:53.952
So you're feeling a little
P.O.'d about P.E., huh?

03:55.420 --> 03:57.317
But physical education
is a state requirement.

03:57.347 --> 03:59.393
I can't just let you out of it.

03:59.423 --> 04:02.759
But, what if, I don't know,
instead of class,

04:02.789 --> 04:04.685
we did an independent...

04:04.715 --> 04:06.427
study in something

04:06.457 --> 04:08.403
sort of physical,
something, like,

04:08.433 --> 04:11.183
I don't know,
that the school doesn't offer.

04:11.213 --> 04:14.014
Independent study...
I like the sound of that.

04:14.044 --> 04:15.564
Sounds like something
I'd come up with.

04:15.594 --> 04:17.262
- You just did. Yeah.
- You did.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.004
- Nailed it.
- Uh, I guess I did.

04:19.034 --> 04:20.980
The superintendent
is going to love this idea.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.962
So, what would you do for
your independent study?

04:23.992 --> 04:25.669
Uh, swimming?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.780
Synchronised swimming.
No, she doesn't mean

04:27.810 --> 04:29.471
- what she says ever.
- Or just regular swimming and splashing.

04:29.501 --> 04:31.020
I love synchronised swimming.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.273
- Who doesn't, huh?
- Yeah. I mean, okay, yeah.

04:33.303 --> 04:35.183
Great.
All right, so, uh...

04:35.213 --> 04:37.300
you'll need an adult
to supervise you.

04:37.330 --> 04:38.867
We know an adult.

04:38.897 --> 04:40.482
We definitely know an adult.

04:40.512 --> 04:42.317
Have 'em sign this.

04:42.347 --> 04:45.968
Linda Belcher...
fancy on the "B"...

04:45.998 --> 04:48.848
definitely signed this form.

04:48.878 --> 04:50.808
Tina, synchronised swimming?

04:50.838 --> 04:52.800
That is the most random sport
in the world.

04:52.830 --> 04:54.241
How'd you even come up
with that?

04:54.271 --> 04:55.865
Mom loves synchronised swimming.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.959
Don't you remember
during the last Olympics?

04:57.989 --> 04:59.734
She made us do
everything synchronised.

04:59.764 --> 05:01.727
And brush and brush
and brush and spit.

05:01.757 --> 05:03.535
Good.

05:03.565 --> 05:06.316
We just got out of P.E. for the
rest of the year, my friends.

05:06.346 --> 05:08.964
Yeah, who needs it?

05:12.325 --> 05:13.333
Phew.

05:13.363 --> 05:15.946
Here, let me try.

05:15.976 --> 05:18.861
Huh. I need to exercise.

05:21.719 --> 05:23.158
First, you fill
the base of the cone.

05:23.188 --> 05:24.200
Boring.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.144
Just let me do
the demonstration, all right?

05:26.174 --> 05:28.991
So the ice cream goes on
the inside of the cone always?

05:29.021 --> 05:30.055
It goes... yes.

05:30.085 --> 05:31.100
It's like an edible bowl.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.624
We get it. Move on.

05:32.654 --> 05:34.735
Wait, if that's ice cream,
why is it soft?

05:34.765 --> 05:36.409
Oh, my God.
I have a question.

05:36.439 --> 05:37.782
Why are you telling us this?

05:37.812 --> 05:39.189
Because I'm going
to need your help.

05:39.219 --> 05:40.939
You guys are going
to be running this thing.

05:40.969 --> 05:42.070
Oh.

05:42.100 --> 05:45.587
I now pronounce you
Team Soft Serve.

05:45.617 --> 05:48.467
I made a soft serve this
morning, so I should be captain.

05:48.497 --> 05:50.058
Kids, time for school.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.566
Here, I washed your gym clothes.

05:51.596 --> 05:52.915
We don't need gym
clothes anymore.

05:52.945 --> 05:54.413
Tina, of course we do.

05:54.443 --> 05:56.094
What, are we going
to run laps naked?

05:58.881 --> 06:01.111
Oh, and Gene, here's
your Navajo warrior mask

06:01.141 --> 06:03.657
for your history class.
Wow, Mom, great job.

06:03.687 --> 06:06.538
It smells like you.

06:06.568 --> 06:08.761
I've been wearing it
all morning. I love it.

06:12.094 --> 06:14.409
Thanks, Mom.
I hope we get a good grade.

06:14.439 --> 06:15.850
Hmm, uh-uh-uh.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.060
Don't you make noises at me,
you judge-a-roo.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.366
Go play your judge-eridoo.

06:19.396 --> 06:20.370
Uh-uh.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.469
Ah-ah!

06:21.499 --> 06:24.023
Suckers.

06:24.053 --> 06:25.864
Louise, why aren't you
in P.E.?

06:25.894 --> 06:28.494
Do you guys have lice?
I do. I do.

06:28.524 --> 06:31.224
For your information,
we don't do P.E. anymore.

06:31.254 --> 06:33.066
We do independent study,
thank you.

06:33.096 --> 06:34.774
Yeah, we're off the grid.

06:34.804 --> 06:35.913
So long, balls.

06:35.943 --> 06:37.527
- Heads up!
- Ow.

06:38.723 --> 06:40.250
Ow.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.746
♪ Headin' out of P.E. ♪

06:42.776 --> 06:47.033
♪ Gives us time

06:57.463 --> 07:00.899

07:02.890 --> 07:05.070
Mr. Frond,
pretty yarn.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.269
Do you knit?

07:06.299 --> 07:07.506
You tell me.

07:08.784 --> 07:09.960
What up, my knitta?

07:09.990 --> 07:12.339
So, let's talk
synchronised swimming.

07:12.369 --> 07:14.281
Oh, yeah, I'm
always up for that.

07:14.311 --> 07:15.319
Big commitment.

07:15.349 --> 07:16.727
I bet.

07:16.757 --> 07:19.205
I still have
the '96 Olympics on VHS.

07:19.235 --> 07:21.416
The Miracle on Melted Ice.

07:21.446 --> 07:24.397
Ooh, I have Dynasty on VHS.

07:24.427 --> 07:27.210
Well, I can't wait to see
the routine you choreograph

07:27.240 --> 07:29.506
for the kids
in independent study.

07:29.536 --> 07:33.206
Independent what?...?!

07:33.236 --> 07:35.031
Those little sneaks.

07:35.061 --> 07:36.981
I can't believe they lied
to Mr. Frond like that.

07:37.012 --> 07:38.130
Ah, here you go, sir.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.120
And they used me in their lie.
What do you expect?

07:40.151 --> 07:41.730
You coddle them too much.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.572
Well, I'm not going
to coddle them this time.

07:43.602 --> 07:45.146
I'm going to get real tough.

07:45.176 --> 07:47.156
What a day at school.

07:47.186 --> 07:49.393
I feel so physically educated.

07:49.423 --> 07:51.075
Hello, kids.

07:51.105 --> 07:54.643
I had a very interesting
encounter with Mr. Frond today.

07:54.673 --> 07:56.652
You did?
Yeah, he's an interesting guy.

07:56.682 --> 07:58.880
Yeah, he is
very interesting, Tina.

07:58.910 --> 08:00.487
He's so interesting

08:00.517 --> 08:03.251
that he told me
about your independent study.

08:03.281 --> 08:04.675
Uh... I got to go.

08:04.705 --> 08:07.253
I have forgot
everything outside.

08:07.283 --> 08:08.861
Sit down.
I got big, big news for you.

08:08.891 --> 08:11.675
You're not going to get
away with it, either.

08:11.705 --> 08:13.545
Dad, do you want some help
with the soft serve?

08:13.576 --> 08:16.196
Get over here. Look at this face
and remember it

08:16.226 --> 08:20.283
because it's the face of your
new synchronised swimming coach.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.258
What? Lin.

08:22.288 --> 08:23.389
Huh...?

08:26.932 --> 08:29.247
I guess we actually have to do
synchronised swimming now.

08:29.277 --> 08:31.458
Tina, this is the woman
who chewed your food

08:31.488 --> 08:33.534
for you when you had
your tonsils out.

08:33.565 --> 08:35.164
We're not going to
have to lift a finger.

08:35.195 --> 08:37.285
Okay, you two,
lift your fingers.

08:37.316 --> 08:40.133
Synchronised swimming
starts at your fingertips

08:40.163 --> 08:41.573
and ends with your tippy toes.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.164
I like it!

08:43.193 --> 08:46.179
It holds things in, in
all the right places.

08:46.209 --> 08:48.322
Why is Gene wearing
a girl's suit?

08:48.352 --> 08:50.272
'Cause, otherwise,
we wouldn't look synchronised.

08:50.304 --> 08:52.426
All right, everyone
in the pool. Come on.

08:53.845 --> 08:55.524
Whistles are
for lifeguards only.

08:55.554 --> 08:57.597
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

08:57.627 --> 08:59.744
Mom... I mean, uh, Coach,

08:59.774 --> 09:03.596
before we dive in, maybe we
could watch you do a few moves.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.321
We're visual learners,
right, guys?

09:05.351 --> 09:07.297
Yeah, like Jennifer Beals
in Flashdance.

09:07.327 --> 09:09.697
She had to watch a lot
of welding before she got good.

09:09.727 --> 09:10.948
I love Flashdance.

09:10.978 --> 09:13.427
Okay, I see your point.

09:13.457 --> 09:16.508
This is called
the eggbeater kick.

09:16.538 --> 09:19.018
Nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang-nang-nang-nang...

09:19.052 --> 09:19.925
Looking good, Mom!

09:19.955 --> 09:22.299
I'm learning a lot from looking!

09:22.329 --> 09:23.777
See, not so bad.

09:23.807 --> 09:25.351
I could get used to this.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.757
Hi.
Hello.

09:26.787 --> 09:28.064
How are you?
I'm fine.

09:28.094 --> 09:29.337
How are you?

09:29.367 --> 09:31.146
I'm good...
not drowning.

09:31.176 --> 09:32.251
That could change.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.390
Please don't lean on the...

09:33.420 --> 09:34.854
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.012
Be right with you.

09:38.042 --> 09:39.201
Here's your ice cream, Teddy.

09:39.231 --> 09:40.624
Bob, this is too cold.

09:40.654 --> 09:41.897
Can you just put it
in the microwave for me?

09:41.927 --> 09:43.206
I can't do that
right now, Teddy.

09:43.236 --> 09:44.489
It's too cold.
I can't eat it.

09:44.519 --> 09:46.001
Just eat it as is!
I can't eat this.

09:46.031 --> 09:47.542
- Oh, my God.
- Just warm it up for me.

09:47.572 --> 09:49.802
Teddy, you're killing me.
Come on, take a second.

09:49.832 --> 09:51.963
- Give me the ice cream. Give it to me.
- Don't put it on too long, now.

09:51.993 --> 09:53.671
Excuse me. Can I get
a sample of the chocolate?

09:53.701 --> 09:55.429
Why do you need a sample?
You don't need a sample.

09:55.459 --> 09:57.070
But how will I know
what it tastes like?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.315
It's chocolate...
it tastes like chocolate tastes.

09:59.345 --> 10:01.558
Is it nonfat?
Um, no.

10:01.588 --> 10:03.568
What percentage of fat is it?
I don't know.

10:03.598 --> 10:05.745
Is it two percent?
I don't know.

10:05.775 --> 10:06.985
You should get it melted.

10:07.015 --> 10:08.442
Can we get a sample
of the melted?

10:08.472 --> 10:09.915
You won't be sorry.
Teddy.

10:09.945 --> 10:10.919
What?
Stop.

10:10.949 --> 10:12.193
Uh, Bob...

10:12.223 --> 10:13.701
I think my medium rare burger

10:13.731 --> 10:15.409
is turning into a
well done situation.

10:15.439 --> 10:17.399
- Oh, crap.
- Bobby, take it out of the microwave.

10:17.431 --> 10:20.237
- Bobby, take it out of the microwave.
- I'm cooking now, Teddy.

10:20.267 --> 10:22.107
Bobby, take the ice cream out
of the microwave.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.427
We're back.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.977
Lin, you can't keep
the kids this late.

10:25.007 --> 10:26.679
I need you guys to be here.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.786
Here, Teddy, there's your
bowl of melted ice cream.

10:28.816 --> 10:30.381
Oh, the bowl is hot.

10:30.411 --> 10:33.094
I can't do burgers
and ice cream by myself.

10:33.124 --> 10:34.970
Dad's freaking out.
I'm not freaking out!

10:35.000 --> 10:36.812
- Totally freaking out.
- Shut up!

10:36.842 --> 10:38.168
Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:38.198 --> 10:39.508
I'm gonna go change.

10:39.538 --> 10:40.928
Me, too.
I'm not.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.255
How was swim practice, Lin?

10:42.285 --> 10:43.528
Good... the kids will be ready

10:43.558 --> 10:45.252
to get in the water any day now.

10:45.282 --> 10:46.957
They haven't gotten
in the water yet?

10:46.987 --> 10:48.799
They're visual learners, Bob.

10:48.829 --> 10:49.942
It's a scam, Linda.

10:49.972 --> 10:51.081
They're not playing a sport.

10:51.111 --> 10:52.957
They're playing you again.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.631
Look, soft serve.
Oh, God.

10:54.661 --> 10:56.378
All right, here's a sample.

10:56.408 --> 10:57.928
I want vanilla.
Do you have strawberry?

10:57.958 --> 10:58.902
Swirl it.
Swirl it.

10:58.932 --> 11:01.916
Look, we don't do swirls
or sprinkles or strawberry.

11:01.946 --> 11:04.545
- Swirl it.
- This is not low fat!

11:04.575 --> 11:06.773
Oh, my God. Just spit it out.
Spit it. Spit it.

11:06.803 --> 11:08.246
You're my best friend.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.637
You're my best friend.
All right.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.350
All the teenagers leave!
Little Leaguers, too!

11:12.380 --> 11:13.589
I ate some of that sponge.

11:13.619 --> 11:15.253
- I want a sponge.
- Out!

11:18.766 --> 11:19.808
Gene, boogers.

11:21.105 --> 11:22.964
That is good stuff. Uncut.

11:22.994 --> 11:24.894
Kids, down here!

11:24.924 --> 11:26.870
Time to work on scissor kicks.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.370
Today, we're going to actually
do them in the water.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.419
Gene just ate, Mom.

11:30.449 --> 11:31.844
We could get a cramp.

11:31.874 --> 11:33.385
What are you guys doing here?

11:33.415 --> 11:36.131
Mr. Frond made us
independent study kids, too.

11:36.161 --> 11:37.828
Whee!

11:37.858 --> 11:40.837
We could use more people
for a pyramid lift.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.814
Or we could make a circle.

11:42.844 --> 11:45.612
Concentric circles.

11:49.274 --> 11:50.407
Ooh.

11:54.952 --> 11:57.317
Hey, Linda,
I like the choreography.

11:57.347 --> 12:00.646
You're a great coach...
a beautiful, sensual coach.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.948
Thank you, Tom Selleck.

12:06.156 --> 12:07.722
Kids, stop!
Stop! Stop!

12:07.752 --> 12:10.280
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Marco.

12:10.310 --> 12:11.854
Wahlberg.

12:11.884 --> 12:14.232
No whistles.
You know that.

12:14.262 --> 12:15.605
I know the whistle rule!

12:15.635 --> 12:17.682
Fine. Please don't
lean on the chair.

12:17.712 --> 12:19.222
What's wrong with you kids?

12:19.252 --> 12:20.965
Don't you care about
your independent study?

12:20.995 --> 12:23.677
- No.
- Louise said this class was a joke.

12:23.707 --> 12:25.352
Yeah. Say something funny.

12:25.382 --> 12:28.028
Louise, Tina, Gene,
get over here now.

12:28.058 --> 12:29.493
Ah... good one.

12:29.523 --> 12:31.503
Cannonball!

12:31.533 --> 12:33.558
That is it!

12:33.588 --> 12:34.981
Your father was right.

12:35.011 --> 12:36.862
You're just taking
advantage of me.

12:36.892 --> 12:40.659
You and Dad were talking about
us behind our backs? Not cool!

12:40.689 --> 12:43.121
If you don't care
about your P.E. requirement,

12:43.151 --> 12:44.946
then I don't, either.

12:44.976 --> 12:46.873
I quit!

12:46.903 --> 12:51.289
Looks like somebody's ready
to coach independent drama.

12:53.015 --> 12:54.660
Where are you guys going?

12:54.690 --> 12:55.829
The pool's that way.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.406
Screw the pool.

12:57.436 --> 12:59.316
Without our mom around,
we make the rules again.

12:59.347 --> 13:01.523
Oh! Am I glad I
caught you guys.

13:01.553 --> 13:03.302
I have very exciting news.

13:03.332 --> 13:04.842
I pulled some strings,

13:04.872 --> 13:07.304
left several
persuasive voice mails.

13:07.334 --> 13:10.536
The superintendent
is bringing the school board

13:10.566 --> 13:13.999
to the pool this afternoon
to watch you synchronised-swim.

13:14.029 --> 13:16.130
What?!
But our mom quit. Ow.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.346
They even suggested doing
a graded performance.

13:19.376 --> 13:20.937
We're going to set up
a judges' table.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.411
It'll be like the Olympics.

13:22.441 --> 13:25.593
Mr. Frond... ha!
We should not do this.

13:25.623 --> 13:27.501
The whole point
of independent study

13:27.531 --> 13:29.478
was so that we
wouldn't feel judged.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.019
You're judged from
the day you're born

13:31.049 --> 13:32.492
till the day you die.

13:32.522 --> 13:34.016
The school board
wants to see you

13:34.046 --> 13:36.143
do scissor kicks
and perfect lifts.

13:36.173 --> 13:39.272
Otherwise, you're all
going to summer school.

13:39.302 --> 13:41.056
Summer school?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.256
What am I going to wear?

13:47.498 --> 13:49.636
I'm glad you finally quit
helping the kids, Lin.

13:49.666 --> 13:52.081
- It was the right thing to do.
- You were right, Bob.

13:52.111 --> 13:53.957
I needed to let
my baby birds fly...

13:53.987 --> 13:56.335
my bratty little baby birds fly

13:56.365 --> 13:58.947
- with their crappy little wings.
- That was...

13:58.977 --> 14:00.991
Sometimes you just got to
push 'em out the window.

14:01.021 --> 14:03.021
- Yeah.
- You just got to push 'em right out there.

14:03.053 --> 14:05.111
And if they fall flat,
then that's them.

14:05.141 --> 14:06.335
Well, you know what,
it's nice to have you back.

14:06.365 --> 14:07.657
It's nice to be back.

14:07.687 --> 14:08.980
Hey, you want to train me

14:09.010 --> 14:10.487
on this thing or what?
You bet I do.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.844
All right.
Yeah, you put your...

14:11.874 --> 14:13.411
- Okay.
- Put your hand on the knob.

14:13.441 --> 14:15.161
- Yeah? Like that?
- There you go. Yeah, no.

14:15.191 --> 14:16.448
Like that?
Slow. Slow.

14:16.478 --> 14:18.107
Ah, slow, slow, slow.

14:18.137 --> 14:19.497
♪ Oh... ♪

14:19.527 --> 14:21.189
Yeah, there you go.
Ah.

14:21.219 --> 14:24.925
♪ My love ♪

14:24.955 --> 14:27.486
♪ My darling... ♪

14:27.516 --> 14:30.428
Oh, hey, Tom Selleck.

14:31.753 --> 14:33.565
Uh, Linda, take it easy.

14:33.595 --> 14:35.222
Oh! Oh! Whoo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:35.252 --> 14:37.617
- Yeah, you can't pull it down that hard.
- Okay.

14:37.647 --> 14:39.208
Mom, we're really sorry.

14:39.238 --> 14:41.158
Will you come back and
help us right now, please?

14:41.190 --> 14:42.558
Hmm.
Stay strong, Lin.

14:42.588 --> 14:44.400
Please.

14:44.430 --> 14:46.912
- I accept your apology, and I will help you.
- What?

14:46.942 --> 14:48.721
Great! Let's go.

14:48.751 --> 14:52.506
- I will help you by not helping you. Right?
- Mmm.

14:52.536 --> 14:53.779
Yeah. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.152
What just happened here?

14:55.182 --> 14:57.028
Why is everyone smiling
and not helping?

14:57.058 --> 14:58.970
Mom, Mr. Frond
is making us perform

14:59.000 --> 15:01.415
for the school board
this afternoon.

15:01.445 --> 15:02.856
- Not my problem.
- Exactly.

15:02.886 --> 15:04.999
Not her problem.
It's not my problem.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.308
- Yes, what she said.
- Not mine.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.031
Okay, let's not...

15:08.061 --> 15:10.476
And if we don't pass,
we have to go to summer school.

15:10.506 --> 15:11.865
- Summer school?
- Yeah. What next?

15:11.895 --> 15:14.831
Summer church?
Summer dentist?

15:14.861 --> 15:16.036
Summer visit Grandma?

15:16.066 --> 15:18.214
Summer camp?
Wait, I'd go there.

15:18.244 --> 15:20.056
You guys made your
bed, and now you're

15:20.086 --> 15:21.462
- going to have to swim in it.
- Whoa, whoa.

15:21.492 --> 15:23.052
Lin, the kids can't go
to summer school.

15:23.082 --> 15:24.778
We need them here
in the restaurant.

15:24.808 --> 15:26.907
I thought you said quitting
was the right thing to do.

15:26.937 --> 15:28.161
We both said a lot of things.

15:28.191 --> 15:29.200
Just, you help them.

15:29.230 --> 15:30.623
I will not, you hypocrite.

15:30.653 --> 15:32.114
If you want to help the kids...

15:32.144 --> 15:33.520
you're such
a know-it-all parent...

15:33.550 --> 15:35.078
then help them yourself.
I'm done.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.121
- Yeah! Dad, help us!
- Yeah! Help us, Dad! Please.

15:37.151 --> 15:38.494
That's a great idea!

15:38.524 --> 15:39.634
No, no, no.
What? No, not me.

15:39.664 --> 15:41.495
- Yeah. Yes, you.
- No, I'm busy.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.581
Dad.
Hmm?

15:42.611 --> 15:44.356
Summer School.

15:44.386 --> 15:47.154
And you're here all alone
without Team Soft Serve.

15:47.184 --> 15:48.743
It's too cold.
I can't eat it.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.301
What percentage of fat is it?

15:50.331 --> 15:51.642
Swirl it.
Is it nonfat?

15:51.672 --> 15:53.312
- Take it out of the microwave.
- Uh, Bob.

15:53.342 --> 15:55.191
Swirl it.
The bowl is hot.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.498
Totally freaking out.

15:56.528 --> 15:57.972
- Swirl it.
- No!

15:58.002 --> 16:00.065
Okay, fine.

16:00.095 --> 16:02.745
I guess I'll have to figure out
some kind of routine.

16:02.775 --> 16:04.989
I taught you kids
how to use this, right?

16:05.019 --> 16:06.261
Yeah.
But I still don't

16:06.291 --> 16:08.003
understand where
the ice cream goes.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.193
All right, shut up.
Forget it.

16:14.297 --> 16:16.779
Superintendent Douglas,
let me get your chair for you.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.303
I got it. I got it.
Yeah. Ah.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.938
Once upon a time,

16:19.968 --> 16:22.524
there was no such thing as math.

16:22.554 --> 16:26.459
Until one brave teacher said,
"Hey, what about math?"

16:26.489 --> 16:29.490
I think independent study
synchronised swimming

16:29.520 --> 16:31.450
will be the next math.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.823
We are so screwed.

16:32.853 --> 16:34.464
We're all gonna die!

16:34.494 --> 16:36.876
Let's die like we were born...
two minutes apart!

16:36.906 --> 16:38.517
All right, everybody, calm down.

16:38.547 --> 16:39.890
Huddle up. Come here.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.298
We can fake our way
through this.

16:41.328 --> 16:43.458
We'll do a few of these
and some of this.

16:43.488 --> 16:44.764
And maybe we'll be okay.

16:44.794 --> 16:46.482
Dad, go change into your suit.

16:46.512 --> 16:48.046
I'm in my suit.
