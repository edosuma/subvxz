00:03.403 --> 00:05.771
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.840 --> 00:07.739
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:07.808 --> 00:12.277
¶ That started from this tropic
port aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.346 --> 00:14.813
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailing man ¶

00:14.882 --> 00:17.115
¶ The skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.184 --> 00:19.518
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.586 --> 00:21.720
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:21.789 --> 00:24.689
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:24.758 --> 00:26.691
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.760 --> 00:28.860
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.929 --> 00:31.196
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.264 --> 00:33.799
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.868 --> 00:35.901
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:35.970 --> 00:38.303
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.372 --> 00:40.606
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.074

    uncharted desert isle ¶

01:17.711 --> 01:21.246
Skipper, I just can't stop
thinking about it. I just can't.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.548
Boy, the way you played
         that fish, two hours.

01:23.617 --> 01:26.452
- You must be tired.
      - I am.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.053
That's why I'd like
to get some sleep, Gilligan.

01:29.122 --> 01:31.189
- Goodnight.
     - Goodnight, Skipper.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.592
We'll talk about it later, okay?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.594
- Okay. Goodnight.
       - Goodnight.

01:37.932 --> 01:38.831
When?

01:40.334 --> 01:42.801
- When what?
 - When will we talk about it?

01:42.870 --> 01:45.871
Oh, Gilligan. We'll talk
 about it in the morning, okay?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.172
- Okay.
          - Goodnight!

01:47.240 --> 01:48.540
Goodnight.

01:50.143 --> 01:52.878
That sure was a beautiful fish.
 Must have weighed 100 pounds.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.647
It leaped outta the water
       and dove into the bottom.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.016
The way you reeled him in
       and played him out

01:58.085 --> 02:01.853
reeled him in and played him
 out. It's too bad you lost him.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.855
Gilligan, not another word
   about that fish.

02:03.923 --> 02:06.525
'Not another word about
  anything. Now go to sleep.'

02:06.593 --> 02:07.759
Goodnight.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.882
Skipper! Skipper!
               Skipper!

02:30.951 --> 02:32.417
Who's skip..

02:32.486 --> 02:34.419
Gilligan, you woke me up again.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.421
(Gilligan)
       'There's a gorilla
       in the window.'

02:39.859 --> 02:43.228
He was there, Skipper.
          Honest, I saw him.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.564
He's not there now.
You must have dreamt it.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.066
How can I dream
    when I wasn't even sleeping.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.901
Gilligan, please,
just go to sleep

02:49.970 --> 02:51.937
and dream that
it isn't there.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.305
Okay.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.830
Sure am glad you're a dream.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.554
Darling, you need a shave.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.956
[grunts]

03:45.025 --> 03:47.826
You say you never snore.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.377
Well, it's not on the floor.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.680
Are you sure you didn't
wear it to bed?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.249
No, dear. I know I left it
      on that nightstand.

04:11.318 --> 04:12.651
[exclaims]
        It is insured, isn't it?

04:12.719 --> 04:14.519
That won't do us
any good financially.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.521
- Why not?
- We own the insurance company.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.055
Oh, yes, of course.

04:18.124 --> 04:21.493
But I'll be heartbroken anyway
  if we didn't find it.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.795
You gave it to me
           as a wedding present.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.097
Yes, it has been
in the family for generations.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.933
It's a piece of jewelry
Queen Isabella gave to Columbus.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.070
You never told me that. How did
 it get in the Howell family?

04:32.138 --> 04:34.873
I'm not sure. They must have
foreclosed the mortgage on Nina

04:34.942 --> 04:38.410
the Pinta and the Santa Maria.
You did have it at dinner time.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.512
Don't you know you
         had to change your seat

04:40.581 --> 04:42.514
because it kept reflecting
      the evening sun.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.083
Yes, 48 carats
does throw a glare.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.885
Besides, it kept
melting the butter.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.920
You sure you didn't
wear it after that?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.490
No. I know I left it
            on that nightstand.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.859
Well, don't panic, darling.
     We'll find it somewhere.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.663
- Skipper, you want syrup?
   - 'Sure.'

05:09.476 --> 05:11.610
This tree needs a refill.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.349
- Boy, I sure am hungry.
    - Yeah.

05:18.885 --> 05:22.387
Well, if I ate like that
  I'd see gorillas at night too.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.923
Oh, be my guest.
But I did see a gorilla.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.292
- I tell you, you didn't.
   - I did.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.394
- You didn't.
         - I did.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.929
- You didn't.
          - I did.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.498
Alright. You did.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.933
Would you please
go back to didn't?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.636
It's the gorilla!

05:39.606 --> 05:41.038
- Morning, Skipper.
    - Good morning, Skipper.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.840
Oh, good morning.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.176
- Blueberries for breakfast.
  - I picked blackberries too.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.845
You're just
in time, girls.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.080
I was about to give
   Gilligan the raspberries.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.316
I think I'll go get some
 coconut milk for the pancakes.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.118
What's the matter
with Gilligan, Skipper?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.954
[sighs]

06:14.274 --> 06:15.306
bam

06:15.375 --> 06:16.541
Ow!

06:28.221 --> 06:29.388
[growls]

06:30.691 --> 06:32.724
Please be a dream.
              Please.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.828
It isn't. Skipper!

06:37.897 --> 06:38.964
Skipper!

06:41.969 --> 06:43.034
Skipper! Skipper!

06:44.704 --> 06:47.172
'Skipper! Skipper!'

06:47.241 --> 06:50.675
Skipper! Skipper!
               Skipper!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.143
(Gilligan)
           'Skipper!'

06:52.212 --> 06:54.746
Gilligan, he can't even pick
  coconuts by himself.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.684
[groaning]

06:59.753 --> 07:02.354
- Buddy, where are you?
    - 'Skipper. Skipper!'

07:02.422 --> 07:04.155
Gilligan.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.257
(Gilligan)
  Better watch out,
  'cause I'm the Skipper's buddy

07:06.326 --> 07:07.892
and he'll take you apart.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.361
Skipper!

07:10.430 --> 07:11.963
Watch out, Skipper.
He's mean and vicious.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.165
- Who is mean and vicious?
   - The gorilla.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.633
What gorilla?

07:15.702 --> 07:18.236
The gorilla got me pinned
by the neck against the tree.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.573
Gilligan, a palm leaf
           has you by the neck.

07:21.642 --> 07:24.075
He was here. He's big
and black and fierce.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.010
[growls]

07:25.078 --> 07:26.511
Stop that.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.381
First, you see gorillas in your
 sleep, now in the daytime.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.449
What you need is
                a psychiatrist.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.152
I bet if I see one,
he has long, hairy arms.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.023
- Wai-Wait for me.
       - Gilligan!

07:39.225 --> 07:41.092
Can't even pick coconuts.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.667
We've searched the hut three
 times, and it's still missing.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.169
We'll be glad
        to help you look for it.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.570
That is not the point.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.371
Mrs. Howell's diamond brooch
    has been missing.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.141
How could that disappear?

07:56.210 --> 07:58.709
The brooch is not where
    Mrs. Howell put it.

07:58.778 --> 08:01.780
It is not in our hut.
  Now, do I make myself clear?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.815
Are you suggesting
      one of us took it?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.950
I'm not suggesting
      anything like that.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.052
However, that might not be
   such a bad suggestion.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.056
Mr. Howell, we don't have
to listen to such an accusation.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.558
And that goes for me too.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.993
I'm surprised at you,
Mr. Howell.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.863
None proclaim their innocence
   so loudly as the guilty.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.234
I don't know if that fits,
 but it's from a movie I was in.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.005
I'm sure I didn't take it,
I'm even sure the others didn't.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.441
Well, the fact is, Gilligan,
    the brooch is still missing.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.108
Maybe Mrs. Howell lost it.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.078
No, no. She's absolutely sure
   she put it on the nightstand.

08:34.147 --> 08:39.082
She's 100% positive,
  she's 100%<i> absolutely</i> certain.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.086
However, maybe
             she made a mistake.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.087
Then, in that case,
             I better apologize.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.857
- Should I go tell 'em?
  - I'll do better than that.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.726
I'll make an offer of a reward
  to anyone who finds it.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.261
- A reward?
        - That's right.

08:50.329 --> 08:54.065
- Ten thousand dollars.
  - Ten thousand dollars! Oh!

08:55.502 --> 08:58.537
Maybe I should have made it
     five. Oh, it's deductible.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.273
I'll never talk to him
     as long as I live.

09:02.341 --> 09:03.841
He said he was sorry.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.644
Just because he's rich doesn't
mean he can push people around.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.780
- He apologized.
   - So what? He apologized.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.815
Not only that,
            he offered a reward

09:10.884 --> 09:13.751
if anyone finds the diamond.
    Ten thousand dollars.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.754
Ten thousand dollar reward?

09:16.823 --> 09:19.891
Well, of course, little buddy,
what kind of a man will I be

09:19.960 --> 09:22.093
if I didn't accept his apology?

09:22.162 --> 09:23.027
[foot crushing]

09:23.096 --> 09:25.296
Ow!

09:25.365 --> 09:29.400
- Apologized? Here's turtle egg.
- It makes my blood boil.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.237
- Him accusing us is beyond me.
- He said he was sorry.

09:32.306 --> 09:35.306
- It's too late to be sorry.
 - This is one of those times.

09:35.374 --> 09:37.809
Nothing he could say
   could make me forgive him.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.378
If you wanna associate with him,
Gilligan, it's your business

09:40.447 --> 09:41.913
but leave us out of it.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.515
I won't tell you about the
reward. Ten thousand dollars.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.751
(all)
     Ten thousand dollars?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.929
[exclaims]
          There it is.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.767
Oh! Why does coral have
    to gleam like that?

10:11.844 --> 10:14.144
They went to the spring
    before they went to bed

10:14.213 --> 10:16.147
they would have
       to come this way.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.150
I hope we find it.
'Cause if we do, when rescued

10:19.218 --> 10:22.286
we can get a new car, 60-foot
yacht and build a new marina.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.122
Gilligan, $10,000 wouldn't be
a down payment for those things.

10:25.191 --> 10:28.559
- Oh? Let's not look for it.
  - Oh, come here.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.896
Ten thousand dollars will help
  us pay for a new boat for us.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.399
- Yeah.
        - Start looking.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.176
I'll tell you one thing,
    Skipper.

10:46.245 --> 10:49.947
I don't care how much the reward
was I wouldn't be out here alone

10:50.016 --> 10:52.817
with that gorilla...
      on the loose.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.621
Skipper! Skipper! Ski..

10:57.690 --> 11:00.324
What's the matter, Gilligan? Did
another banana leaf attack you?

11:00.393 --> 11:03.328
I know you don't believe me,
    but there was a gorilla.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.263
Oh! Stop that talk.
Come on.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.067
Gilligan, there's not a gorilla
within 5,000 miles of here.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.370
Now, let's look
for that diamond.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.125
They had to take one of these
paths. I'll take this one.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.861
You take that one.
I'll meet you at the spring.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.262
- Oh, no, Skipper. Ski--
    - Now, Gilligan.

11:38.331 --> 11:42.033
Keep thinking of that $10,000
reward. Start looking.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.940
I thought you're gonna
     take the other path.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.877
Don't play tricks on me.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.750
Skipper! Skipper! Skipper!
   Skipper! Skipper! Skip--

11:58.818 --> 12:00.584
What is it?
Did you find the diamond?

12:00.653 --> 12:02.053
No. No. But I saw--

12:02.122 --> 12:04.155
You're not gonna tell me
about that gorilla again?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.457
Okay, I won't tell you,
    but something frightened me.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.858
Well, what was it?

12:07.927 --> 12:10.161
Was about this tall,
            has long, hairy arms

12:10.230 --> 12:13.831
and walks like this, weighs
  250 pounds. Maybe it's a bird.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.234
A-a-a b-b-bird?
It sounds like a gorilla.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.469
A gorilla?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.610
They've searched every place
and can't find it.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.212
Yes, I know that.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.981
But after some of the things
    I said this morning

12:30.050 --> 12:31.983
whoever found it might find it
  embarrassing to return.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.318
Now, here's the plan.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.353
I'm gonna turn out both torches,
you understand.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.822
And whoever has the diamond
     can leave it on the table

12:37.891 --> 12:39.423
and no questions
                will be asked.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.193
Oh, Thurston, you're so clever
about these things.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.128
I'm sure if you'd
been a detective

12:44.196 --> 12:45.829
you'd have caught
the fugitive by now.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.365
Yes, I agree.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.102
Now, Lovey, when I tell you,
you turn out the torch, alright?

12:51.171 --> 12:54.171
Oh, I know that
     you're all very tired

12:54.240 --> 12:56.808
I appreciate your searching,
  but I have a little plan.

12:56.877 --> 13:00.044
Now, here we have
       a $10,000 reward.

13:00.112 --> 13:03.147
We're gonna turn out torches
whoever finds the diamond

13:03.216 --> 13:05.450
has found it
   can leave it on the table

13:05.518 --> 13:07.452
and take the money,
      no questions asked.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.587
If we haven't got it,
           we haven't got it.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.156
Well, after those foolish things
I said this morning

13:12.225 --> 13:15.193
I feel someone might be a little
embarrassed about returning it.

13:15.261 --> 13:15.960
Ah, ready?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.196
Okay, Lovey.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.635
(Lovey)
      'Stop that.
      What are you doing?'

13:24.704 --> 13:25.837
[Lovey screaming]

13:25.906 --> 13:27.572
Lovey!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.006
[screaming continues]

13:29.075 --> 13:30.407
Where's Lovey?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.244
- Oh! Lovey's gone.
      - It's a gorilla.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.549
He's got her.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.287
Lovey!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.190
[all shouting]

13:56.870 --> 13:58.536
Lovey!

14:00.607 --> 14:02.140
Lovey!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.442
Mrs. Howell!

14:06.179 --> 14:10.014
- Mrs. Howell!
         - Mrs. Howell!

14:10.083 --> 14:13.218
- Mrs. Howell!
          - Mrs. Howell!

14:14.754 --> 14:17.488
Oh, little buddy. I'll never
ever doubt what you say again.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.523
That gorilla you saw
really was a gorilla.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.326
I'm sorry, Skipper. I should
    have let him be a dream.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.862
- Mrs. Howell!
         - Mrs. Howell!

14:24.930 --> 14:26.865
- Mrs--
            - Mrs--

14:29.402 --> 14:30.602
- Mrs. Howell!
         - Mrs. Howell!

14:39.478 --> 14:41.646
He's not only strong,
but he's smart too.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.215
We'll have to camouflage this
pretty well to fool him.

14:44.283 --> 14:47.084
If you put a bunch of bananas
   in here, I'd get 'em.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.685
That's right, Gilligan.

14:48.754 --> 14:51.556
But as the Professor just
 pointed out, the ape is smart.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.437
No trace of Mrs. Howell
and that beast

15:06.506 --> 15:08.672
and I've searched every inch
of this island.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.975
Once we've finished this trap,
 we'll go out again.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.810
Carry me, will you?

15:12.878 --> 15:15.079
We're making a map
of the island.

15:17.349 --> 15:19.651
Some trap. It's not even
  finished, and it caught me.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.621
There's got to be a logical
     and a scientific way

15:23.689 --> 15:25.556
to figure out
       where that gorilla lives.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.824
The only problem is, Professor

15:26.893 --> 15:29.359
the gorilla doesn't know
anything about logic or science.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.529
Skipper, you have
        to think like a gorilla.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.830
Think like a gorilla?

15:32.899 --> 15:35.133
Yeah, I understand animals
      and get along with them.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.002
If I was a gorilla,
 where would I take Mrs. Howell?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.537
[imitating a gorilla]

15:40.940 --> 15:44.374
We're busy here. Go over there
and do your gorilla thinking.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.344
- The caves.
    - Of course, the caves.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.645
That's amazing.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.947
My little buddy does think
   like a gorilla.

15:50.016 --> 15:52.182
He even looks like a gorilla.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.585
- Now, let's go.
  - Follow me, I know the way.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.156
Oh, Gilligan. Stop that now.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.959
(Lovey)
Would you just get away from me?

16:02.027 --> 16:03.627
[screams]

16:03.696 --> 16:06.831
Don't you think you're carrying
 this joke a little too far?

16:06.900 --> 16:09.901
Step aside and let me pass.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.937
Your parents certainly
  didn't bring you up very well.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.472
Do you know who I am?

16:14.541 --> 16:16.974
I'm the wife
         of Thurston Howell III.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.476
[growls]

16:18.544 --> 16:21.612
Really, you're a..
       You're rude.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.614
Oh! Go away.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.584
Lovey!

16:28.388 --> 16:30.321
Oh, there she is. There she is.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.589
Lovey, my dear.
   My dear, are you alright?

16:32.658 --> 16:36.427
Yes, I'm alright, but this
   baboon has my diamond brooch.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.697
I mean this miniature King Kong
has my brooch.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.566
He won't let me out of here.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.635
Ah, that's a Howell for you.
Hasn't lost her sense of humor.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.736
Out of my way.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.272
Sir, I am Thurston Howell III.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.975
I told him that, darling,
  but he doesn't seem impressed.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.577
I'm a Harvard man.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.116
Good heavens, the Yale man.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.918
He hasn't harmed her,
he likes her.

17:00.986 --> 17:02.787
I assure you,
    she didn't run with him.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.589
I'll lure him outta the cave,
and she can sneak past.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.592
You do that,
  we'll be eternally grateful.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.694
- We're real proud of you.
   - Careful, Gilligan.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.762
Hi. Hi, old pal.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.298
Remember me, we held hands
   in the jungle, huh?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.006
Now follow me.
       Follow the leader.

17:23.075 --> 17:26.310
Come on, follow the leader.
  Come on, follow the leader.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.445
Let's face it, that gorilla's
 just a dumb animal

17:28.513 --> 17:30.248
he knows nothing
        but brute force.

17:30.316 --> 17:33.117
I'll threaten him with this
club. I'll show him who's boss.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.156
[screams]

17:44.464 --> 17:47.431
Are you alright?
Now I know who's boss, huh?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.933
Why doesn't he let us near her?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.635
He's just protecting
            his mate.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.871
- His mate? Really?
- It's just a figure of speech.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.906
But that's the way
       the gorilla really feels.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.142
It's a one-sided affair.
    Is there anything we can do?

17:59.211 --> 18:00.678
We haven't
                got any weapons.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.481
We can't rush him because
      he might hurt Mrs. Howell.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.552
We need to capture him
          with a net.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.654
Gilligan, why don't you start
   collecting some strong vines.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.389
- Sure.
   - That's right, Professor.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.424
I've heard that they capture
  monkeys that way

18:14.493 --> 18:16.928
but we've got to lure him away
 from the cave.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.495
I'll get some food.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.865
If he's being this protective,
 food isn't gonna do it.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.667
Wait a minute.
   He kidnapped Mrs. Howell.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.435
That means this scoundrel
   has an eye for the ladies.

18:25.504 --> 18:28.572
Let's use Ginger and Mary Ann
 as a decoy and drop a net.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.475
I'm not sure that will work,
    but it's worth a try.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.677
But that'll be
kind of dangerous.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.447
I'd be glad to put on
one of the dresses.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.850
No offence, but you putting
on one of the dresses

18:38.918 --> 18:42.153
is like putting a banana skin
over a watermelon.

18:44.056 --> 18:48.058
Poor Mrs. Howell. Gee, Ginger,
maybe we should leave a place

18:48.127 --> 18:49.527
for us to get out.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.895
He's a gorilla, he could come
through the ceiling.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.866
If he comes through the ceiling,
I'm going out through the wall.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.333
[knocking]

18:56.402 --> 18:59.503
- A gorilla wouldn't knock.
  - I don't think so.

18:59.571 --> 19:02.272
- Who is this?
    - 'It's me, Mr. Howell.'

19:02.341 --> 19:04.742
Ow! Well, I'll be damned.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.646
- Did you find Mrs. Howell?
  - Yes.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.748
The beast has her
     and won't let her out.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.549
- Is she alright?
       - She seems to be.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.217
I've come to you for help.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.719
- Help?
            - How?

19:15.788 --> 19:19.090
I want you to act as decoys
  so we can drop a net.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.393
I'd do anything for Mrs. Howell,
but I'd be scared to death.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.261
Mary Ann, you were raised
       on a farm

19:24.330 --> 19:25.763
you know all about animals.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.564
Cows, yes.
Gorillas, no.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.234
Ginger, you're an actress,
 just make believe it's a part

19:30.303 --> 19:34.738
and make believe the gorilla
 is a marvelous wonderful star.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.307
Even if it were Richard Burton
  under all that hair

19:37.376 --> 19:39.676
I'd have to say no.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.513
I'm sorry. You've got
           the wrong girl.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.582
You know a funny thing,
after we're rescued

19:44.651 --> 19:47.385
I'm planning on making
a cinemascope color picture

19:47.453 --> 19:49.820
about a beautiful girl
and a gorilla..

19:49.889 --> 19:51.855
Come on. What are
               we waiting for?

19:51.924 --> 19:54.791
...in a cave.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.194
I'm really very flattered
       by your attention

19:57.263 --> 20:01.499
but...we don't have
            very much in common.

20:02.268 --> 20:04.835
Oh, really?

20:04.904 --> 20:07.805
Just because our ancestors
      used to <i> swing</i> in trees

20:07.873 --> 20:10.575
it's hardly a basis
    for a continuing friendship.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.678
It's getting to be
              a dreadful bore.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.648
Now, be a nice little boy
       and let me pass.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.083
But you don't seem
              to understand.

20:20.152 --> 20:24.255
Thurston's a very generous man,
 he'll buy you a banana farm.

20:25.858 --> 20:29.159
Thurston! Thurston!
             Where are you?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.228
Just be patient, Lovey.

20:31.297 --> 20:33.064
[growls]

20:33.132 --> 20:34.431
Yeah, yourself.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.500
Gilligan's standing by the nets
to release it.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.101
Mr. Howell, you stay
            with Mary Ann.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.805
The Skipper and I will protect
  Ginger. Everybody ready?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.841
Ginger, you know what
          you're supposed to do?

20:43.910 --> 20:47.645
Yeah. Attract a gorilla. Hope my
agent doesn't hear about this.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.617
- Gilligan, everything all set?
- Yes.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.420
Remember, when I snap my fingers
you drop the net.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.390
- You can count on me.
     - Alright, Ginger. Go.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.411
She's attracting
                his attention.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.546
I think that gorilla's
     got sailor's blood.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.753
Ginger! Can you be
a little sexier?

21:29.822 --> 21:31.355
For the gorilla?

21:31.423 --> 21:33.357
Ginger, under the net.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.972
I'll tell you one thing,
   that gorilla isn't human.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.640
Hold it. It's not working.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.542
Ginger, you better go back
with Mr. Howell and Mary Ann.

21:52.611 --> 21:54.411
- Okay, Professor.
    - Thanks a lot, Ginger.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.879
- You're welcome.
       - Wait a minute.

21:55.948 --> 21:59.317
I've got a better idea.
Why didn't I think of it before?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.319
[Professor and Skipper
     grumbling]

22:02.387 --> 22:04.622
Gilligan!

22:04.691 --> 22:06.924
If you were paying attention,
   this wouldn't have happened.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.527
- What I started to say--
  - Before he tripped the net.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.895
He said when he snapped
    his fingers, and he did.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.897
- So when he snapped--
   - Alright, that's enough.

22:13.966 --> 22:16.433
Mr. Howell, does Mrs. Howell
  have any perfume on?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.168
Of course, she does. Why?

22:18.237 --> 22:21.038
He took her brooch which should
 have some scent of her perfume.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.807
Then he took her. Gorillas are
  attracted to sweet fragrances.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.109
- See what I'm getting at?
   - Of course, I do.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.411
Any more of that perfume?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.213
On her dressing table
in the hut.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.282
- Gilligan?
       - I'll go get it.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.517
- What's the name?
       - Warm Afternoon.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.720
- Warm Afternoon?
       - Yes.

22:43.128 --> 22:47.832
"Purple Haze. Happy Hours.
   Foggy Night."

22:48.767 --> 22:52.069
Noon Retfa Mraw.
        Noon Retfa Mraw?

22:53.372 --> 22:56.374
"Warm After...noon."

23:00.279 --> 23:02.480
Don't worry, Lovey.
We've got an idea.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.448
[screams]

23:06.252 --> 23:09.086
I just told Mrs. Howell that
  we're gonna free her

23:09.155 --> 23:10.420
from that hairy delinquent.

23:10.489 --> 23:12.623
Sorry, it's empty.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.825
You don't have to tell us
   what happened.

23:19.264 --> 23:21.399
Skipper!

23:25.103 --> 23:27.704
- The gorilla left me.
 - He found someone attractive.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.440
- Who?
          - Gilligan.

23:29.508 --> 23:30.574
Gilligan?

23:30.643 --> 23:33.010
He does have a certain air
about him.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.582
Oh, gee, I hope
the Professor's right.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.817
These flowers will lure that
gorilla away from Gilligan.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.087
Poor Gilligan.
           The last three hours

23:43.155 --> 23:45.489
that gorilla's looking at him
   with love in his eyes.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.690
Will these be enough?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.859
You take these.
            I'll pick some more.

23:50.796 --> 23:54.798
Ah! There's enough aroma there
 to attract any gorilla.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.900
He hasn't paid any attention
to it so far.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.936
Here comes Mary Ann
             with some more.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.040
[screams]

24:04.109 --> 24:05.442
Let her go. Let her go.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.978
Let her go. Let her go.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.016
[hooting]

24:23.896 --> 24:25.128
Considering the price
       of some of these perfumes

24:25.197 --> 24:26.963
it's nice of Mrs. Howell
        to let us experiment.

24:27.032 --> 24:28.098
Oh, poor Gilligan.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.601
Last time I saw him
the gorilla was sniffing him

24:30.670 --> 24:32.836
like a bloodhound
on a hot scent.

24:32.905 --> 24:36.173
All we have to do is find
   a perfume with the same base.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.175
Skipper! Skipper!

24:38.244 --> 24:40.644
Little buddy! Gilligan!
How did you get away?

24:40.713 --> 24:42.512
He ran after somebody
     he liked better.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.515
- Who?
            - Look.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.822
[chattering]

25:03.335 --> 25:05.301
¶ They're here for
       a long long time ¶

25:05.370 --> 25:07.871
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

25:07.940 --> 25:09.806
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:09.875 --> 25:11.908
¶ The first mate
     and his skipper too ¶

25:11.977 --> 25:13.977
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:14.046 --> 25:18.315
¶ To make the others comfortable
in their tropic island nest ¶

25:18.384 --> 25:20.617
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motor car ¶

25:20.686 --> 25:23.019
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:23.088 --> 25:26.991
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe
   it's primitive as can be ¶

25:27.059 --> 25:29.759
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:29.828 --> 25:31.862
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:31.931 --> 25:36.000
¶ From seven stranded castaways
here on Gilligan's Isle ¶

25:37.305 --> 25:43.238
