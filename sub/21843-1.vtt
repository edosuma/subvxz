00:50.985 --> 00:53.385
- Hey sweetheart, are you ready?

00:56.689 --> 01:00.926
The doctor's gonna make
you feel better, I promise.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.265
I love you.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.551
Stop the car, stop the car.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.495
- Hi uncle Ted.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.096
I'm passing through
town, I was wondering

02:11.098 --> 02:12.898
if I could spend the night.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.233
- Yeah I would love to see you.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.400
I won't be home for
a couple of hours

02:15.402 --> 02:16.902
so when you get there
remember don't...

02:16.904 --> 02:20.239
- don't touch anything,
yeah I remember.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.293
- Hey you make it there okay?

03:14.295 --> 03:17.462
- Yeah, but the power
just went out so...

03:17.464 --> 03:19.131
- Oh that happens.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.366
I'll be home soon to fix it.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.969
- No, is there like a breaker
or something I can get to?

03:23.971 --> 03:26.471
I just really don't feel like
sitting here in the dark.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.873
- Yeah there's
one down in the basement

03:27.875 --> 03:29.508
at the end of the hall.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.576
- Okay.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.182
- Oh god.

06:46.939 --> 06:48.874
- Hey, you fix the power?

06:48.876 --> 06:51.176
- Yeah but I have a question.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.176
- Shoot.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.179
- Um, I know you said
not to touch anything,

06:54.181 --> 06:56.681
but I was wondering if I
could cover the clown statue

06:56.683 --> 06:58.550
that's in the corner
of the living room.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.085
- The what?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.686
- The clown statue in the
corner of the living room.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.255
I have this thing with clowns...

07:03.257 --> 07:04.956
- listen to me closely.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.192
Get out of the house now.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.527
I'll call the police.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.529
- Wait why?

07:10.863 --> 07:12.564
- We don't have a clown statue.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.842
- Ha, thanks a bunch.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.243
- Yeah, no problem.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.013
- Your car is loaded.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.649
- Ah thanks, man, right on.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.086
It would have taken me
forever without you guys.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.956
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
happy to help, so.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.224
- Yeah really happy.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.059
- Yeah.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.031
- Well.

08:23.936 --> 08:26.204
- Shoot, I should get going.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.038
- Yeah okay.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.206
- Yeah, bye.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.508
- Yeah, see ya.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.614
- Could you give me
a hand with this?

08:35.616 --> 08:36.616
- Mm-hmm.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.186
- Aw, thanks man.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.320
- Yeah.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.788
- Okay take care.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.695
- Thank god she's gone.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.297
- She definitely would
have stayed all summer

08:52.299 --> 08:53.198
if we hadn't helped her move.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.366
- Yeah helped her move.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.235
- Oh hey, wait, wait, wait.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.237
Who am I?

09:00.373 --> 09:04.142
Hey... sup hey..
Hey what's that smell?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.912
- Oh, um, ah, you.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.980
- Right on dude right on.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.483
Wait, wait, wait, don't
eat the ones living.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.152
- Sorry, a lot of anti-matter.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.223
- You know what, at
least she paid rent.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.091
- Yeah, well finding
somebody else to take

09:20.093 --> 09:21.493
that room shouldn't be hard.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.028
- You might have to
find two roommates

09:23.030 --> 09:24.663
if I don't pass my classes.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.398
- No, no, you're gonna pass.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.700
Even if I have to take
those classes for you.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.903
- You would do that for me, oh.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.344
- I'm gonna enjoy having the
place to ourselves again.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.612
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.080
You know what, we should
have Jonah over tonight,

09:42.082 --> 09:43.782
maybe anyone else
who's still in town.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.417
- Mm-hmm, we could
play twister again.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.252
- No, that got weird.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.221
Oh, oh, ah, no!

09:50.223 --> 09:51.623
- What?

09:52.692 --> 09:55.193
Oh I can't believe
she left this.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.362
- I hate clowns, get rid of it.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.865
Burn it, feed it to the
dog, I don't care.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.467
Here you go.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.570
- You ready?
- - Yeah.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.939
- Cool dude 'cause
we're walking.

10:21.783 --> 10:23.222
- I'm really sorry miss,

10:23.223 --> 10:25.624
but there's nothing
we can do for you.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.460
- Right, but I ordered
the Grand Canyon sundae

10:28.462 --> 10:30.495
and I didn't get the
Grand Canyon sundae.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.797
- Mm-hmm, yeah,
well I'm really sorry

10:32.799 --> 10:34.599
but there's no
way for us to know that

10:34.601 --> 10:38.069
because you already
ate the entire thing.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.973
- Right, but I ordered
the Grand Canyon sundae.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.412
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.921
Hey pops is out front,
do we have his order ready?

10:56.923 --> 10:58.823
- Yeah it's over there.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.192
So I don't know how
I feel about this.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.427
- What?

11:02.429 --> 11:03.928
- Getting special
orders for pops,

11:03.930 --> 11:05.697
when you should be helping
the customers in the front.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.432
- Oh really?

11:07.434 --> 11:08.700
- This is their vacation.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.269
It's our job to make it great.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.639
- All right, I want to make
sure this order is right,

11:14.641 --> 11:15.874
where's the box cutter?

11:15.876 --> 11:16.941
- I don't know.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.010
- You lost the box cutter?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.145
- I know with our
luck the health

11:20.147 --> 11:21.646
Inspector'll probably find it.

11:21.648 --> 11:25.283
- Well whoever finds it,
you're gonna be fired.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.685
- I should probably
go find that.

11:26.687 --> 11:27.786
- Yeah.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.725
- Hi Emma how are ya?

11:33.727 --> 11:36.327
- Good it's a slow night
tonight so I can't complain.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.862
- You know I'm surprised
you're still here.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.664
I would have thought you'd
gone home for the summer.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.333
- Oh no, summer classes.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.636
- I bet you didn't know
how sleepy this town gets

11:44.638 --> 11:46.237
once all the college
kids go home.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.039
- I know, thankfully
I have company.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.207
Heather and Jonah stayed too.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.575
- Oh really, that's good.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.843
- Yeah.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.311
Here you go, do you
have a box cutter?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.647
I just want to make sure
this is the right order.

11:55.649 --> 11:56.715
- I do.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.551
- Should I be worried that you
just carry that around on you?

11:59.553 --> 12:00.952
- Oh yeah probably.

12:04.365 --> 12:05.324
- Is that right?

12:05.325 --> 12:10.729
- That's it, 50 Clownsicles
with gumball eyeballs.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.599
See ya, thanks.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.601
- Bye.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.343
- I'm gonna be fired before
the end of the summer.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.412
- Yeah I could
have told you that.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.947
- This lady ate all
of her ice cream

12:28.949 --> 12:31.850
and then tried to tell me
that it was the wrong order.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.684
- Was it?

12:32.686 --> 12:33.518
- Was it what?

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
- The wrong order.

12:35.721 --> 12:38.256
- How am I supposed to know
that, she ate the entire thing.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.457
These customers come in
and they think that...

12:39.459 --> 12:43.027
- Heather I'm
kidding, I'm kidding.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.629
Wait are you making
her another one?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.131
- Yeah.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.434
We should spit in it.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.769
- Okay.

12:53.372 --> 12:55.573
- One of these days I'm
actually gonna do it.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.709
- Yeah I'll believe
it when I see it.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.891
Jonah, I'm gonna need to
speak to your manager.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.527
- She's not here but
she put me in charge.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.965
- Listen carefully.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.902
- Is that the sheriff?

13:23.904 --> 13:25.970
- Maybe he's arresting
that customer for you.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.308
- Here?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.411
- Yes, I'm serious.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.681
- Sheriff, are you okay?

13:36.683 --> 13:41.619
- I'm fine, just
do as I ask okay?

13:41.621 --> 13:42.720
- Yes sir.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.825
- Oh. Be safe okay.

13:56.368 --> 13:59.270
- Attention customers,
we're sorry to inform

13:59.272 --> 14:02.106
but we have to
close early tonight.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.009
We ask that the store
be closed in 10 minutes.

14:07.713 --> 14:11.115
Also the local police have
issued an 11 o'clock curfew

14:11.117 --> 14:14.485
so be sure to get home
quickly and safely.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.187
- What's the curfew for?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.093
- A manhunt.

14:23.462 --> 14:24.929
- No way.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.166
- Where are we supposed to go?

14:28.168 --> 14:29.467
- What's a manhunt?

14:31.504 --> 14:34.072
- Look your best option
is to just go home.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.540
Or if you're passing
through, go to the next town

14:35.542 --> 14:37.642
60 miles down highway 24.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.420
- This is insane.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.923
- And terrifying, did the
sheriff say anything else?

14:51.925 --> 14:54.659
- A high school girl was
found dead about an hour ago.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.594
They're trying to find
the guy responsible.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.829
- It must have been really bad,

14:57.831 --> 14:59.564
the sheriff seemed
super freaked.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.499
- Yeah well murder
is a freaky thing.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.601
- Well and nothing ever
happens in this town.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.436
- Seriously, I mean if
anything they're probably

15:05.438 --> 15:07.205
excited to catch
an actual criminal,

15:07.207 --> 15:09.841
not someone going 40 in a 35.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.676
- We're gonna stay
closed tomorrow, right?

15:11.678 --> 15:12.744
- Not when I'm in charge.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.712
We don't close
for the apocalypse.

15:14.714 --> 15:18.716
Speaking of which,
can you close up,

15:18.718 --> 15:20.718
kick everyone else out?

15:20.720 --> 15:21.886
- Alone?

15:21.888 --> 15:23.755
- Door's 10 feet away.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.757
Hey...

15:26.926 --> 15:28.293
Watch our for murderers.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.360
- Ugh.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.896
- Okay, so what
else did the sheriff say?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.965
- Nothing, don't
get too excited.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.733
It's probably all blown
out of proportion.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.268
- Oh man.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.872
- Done and I'm like 90%
sure that I saw him outside.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.641
So Fyi, we're all dying tonight.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.000
- Thanks dad.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.637
I love you too.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.373
I love you too.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.501
Daddy, I can't eat anymore.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.681
You promised to protect me.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.518
This is all your fault.

17:01.653 --> 17:05.189
This is all your fault.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.657
This is all your fault.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.355
- What do you think?

17:37.357 --> 17:38.656
- I like it.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.492
- Good, is it persuasive enough?

17:41.494 --> 17:44.395
- Yes, if it were my
decision I'd be swayed.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.664
- Okay good.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.533
We're supposed to
give a presentation

17:48.535 --> 17:49.734
at the board of
education tomorrow

17:49.736 --> 17:51.669
but I don't know if
I want to go anymore.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.704
- Heather it'll be fine.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.173
Besides I heard
that serial killers

17:55.175 --> 17:57.708
sleep during the
day so you're good.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.911
- Okay you're surprisingly
cool about all this.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.548
- I am, nothing ever happens
here it's kind of exciting.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.584
Now we have detectives running
around solving mysteries.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.286
I don't know I think
it's kind of cool.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.220
- Maybe you should just drop out

18:09.222 --> 18:10.555
and join the police academy.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.523
- Maybe I will.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.759
- Speaking of which, have you heard
anything else from the police?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.427
- Yeah they're redirecting
tourists to the next town

18:16.429 --> 18:18.763
so work should be pretty easy.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.700
- Maybe we should come
up with some sort of like

18:22.702 --> 18:25.069
serial killer tornado drill.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.069
- What?

18:26.071 --> 18:28.706
- No come on, this house is
in the middle of nowhere.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.540
- Come on.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.309
- Better safe than sorry.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.311
- Fine.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.780
- Okay, so if one of us
sees him we could say...

18:35.782 --> 18:36.714
- stranger danger.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.050
- Yes, yes, one
of us could shout

18:39.052 --> 18:40.818
stranger danger
and then run away.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.886
But don't come back
to save me because

18:41.888 --> 18:43.054
I am not gonna save you.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.655
- Not even in the
heat of the moment?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.724
- No in the heat of the
moment it's fight or flight.

18:46.726 --> 18:47.992
- Well I think we should leave

18:47.994 --> 18:50.394
the fight or flight to shammy.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.364
- Just vicious.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.634
Oh, yeah Sammy.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.402
- Good girl, yes.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.804
- Yeah, he'll protect us.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.839
- Good girl Sammy.

19:54.793 --> 19:56.928
Sammy no licking.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.100
Sammy stop, no licking.

22:17.002 --> 22:21.605
Heather!
- You're up early.

22:21.607 --> 22:22.605
- Call the sheriff.

22:22.607 --> 22:23.974
- Why?
- Because I think he was here.

22:23.976 --> 22:24.774
- Who?

22:24.776 --> 22:26.877
- The guy that they're looking
for, I think he was here.

22:26.879 --> 22:27.945
- Wait here right now?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.380
- No last night in my room.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.781
- Wait slow down tell
me what happened?

22:30.783 --> 22:33.284
- Okay last night there
was a man in my bathroom

22:33.286 --> 22:34.285
and then when I woke up...

22:34.287 --> 22:35.619
- wait, wait you woke up?

22:35.621 --> 22:37.621
- Yes, yes, and I
went into the bathroom

22:37.623 --> 22:38.956
and then Sammy was...

22:38.958 --> 22:40.191
- okay where is Sammy now?

22:40.193 --> 22:43.461
- He's, he's, he's gone.

22:43.463 --> 22:44.528
He's gone.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.030
It's all-it's all gone.

22:46.032 --> 22:50.468
- Okay, okay, it sounds like
you just had a bad dream.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.502
- I'm calling the police.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.636
- Emma.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.044
- Why aren't they answering?

23:01.546 --> 23:03.247
Where's Sammy have
you seen Sammy?

23:03.249 --> 23:04.482
- He's probably just scared.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.617
He'll come back he
always comes back okay?

23:07.519 --> 23:11.155
Okay, it's okay,
I'm right here okay, okay?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.427
- Sorry.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.830
This happens sometimes.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.599
- Okay, what happens?

23:23.335 --> 23:26.170
- Night terrors, I've had
them since I was a kid.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.340
- Okay god you scared
me half to death.

23:29.342 --> 23:31.175
- I'm fine, I'm sorry.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.576
- Oh my god.

23:33.578 --> 23:37.214
- I was, I was, still
half asleep or something.

23:37.216 --> 23:40.851
- It's okay just don't
do that to me again.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.756
- It's just when I get
stressed or scared.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.594
- You should have
yelled stranger danger,

23:50.596 --> 23:53.697
I would have go
myself out of here.

23:53.699 --> 23:54.865
- Yeah next time.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.768
- Yeah okay.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.049
- Hello.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.218
- Sheriff, I need
to talk to you.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.754
- We're doing everything we can.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.556
- Bullshit, the only
thing you've ever done

24:18.558 --> 24:19.890
is shut everything down.

24:21.059 --> 24:24.895
- I promise you, we're taking
every appropriate measure.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.230
- Talked to the guys
down at the station,

24:26.232 --> 24:28.032
they said you put
the search on hold.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.402
- I can't talk right now.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.771
- Sheriff come on please.

24:33.773 --> 24:34.905
- I've got to go.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.005
I've got to go.

24:36.007 --> 24:37.508
- Sheriff look, I don't care
what you think about me,

24:37.510 --> 24:39.677
but you got to do your job.

24:39.679 --> 24:45.950
- I am doing everything
I can, I promise you.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.017
- But...

25:33.465 --> 25:34.465
- boo.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.334
- Asshole.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.469
- Ow.
- God.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.905
- Oh well same to you.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.840
- I'm trying to beat
some sense into you.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.408
- Remind me never
to do that again.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.543
- You know what I'll forgive you

25:45.545 --> 25:47.545
if you let Heather and I
close up early and go home.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.313
- Pfft. Uhh,

25:49.315 --> 25:52.850
only if we can do movie
night at your guys' place.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.052
- Fine by me, Heather?

25:55.854 --> 25:58.322
- As long as it's
not a horror movie.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.559
- Deal, we'll close
up after this guy.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.563
- Just give me a number
one and some water.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.765
- That'll be $3.19.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.466
- Keep the change.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.571
- Can you take care of this?

26:13.573 --> 26:14.905
- Yeah, sure.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.283
- Excuse me sir,
I'm really sorry

26:26.285 --> 26:28.252
about what happened
to your daughter.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.424
Sorry, I was just hoping you
could help me with something.

26:33.426 --> 26:34.959
- Not now, please.

26:36.361 --> 26:42.666
- I'm sorry but I think whatever
happened to your daughter,

26:44.369 --> 26:46.370
is happening to me.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.808
- Sit down.

26:54.814 --> 27:01.552
- It was in the sink and
I'm not positive, but

27:01.554 --> 27:06.557
I'm pretty sure my
dog's guts were in it.

27:06.559 --> 27:09.093
- Was there a date and time
written on the balloon?

27:09.095 --> 27:11.662
- Yeah, why?

27:11.664 --> 27:13.764
- I don't want to scare you.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.233
- I'm already scared.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.968
- Whoever did this,

27:17.970 --> 27:21.305
left balloons just like that
with my daughter.

27:22.641 --> 27:26.410
Every one of them had a
date and time written on it.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.846
I didn't even know
what it meant then.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.080
I thought she was
doing it herself.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.615
She was having a very
bad week and she,

27:31.617 --> 27:33.751
I don't know she was
talking about nightmares

27:33.753 --> 27:36.887
and paranormal encounters.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.258
I just thought she was sick.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.461
I was gonna take her to the
doctor but then on the exact

27:44.463 --> 27:46.997
date and time written
on the balloon she was...

27:53.438 --> 27:56.173
What date did it
say on your balloon?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.676
Thursday, 2:31 A.M.

27:59.644 --> 28:02.212
- Then you have two days
to come up with a plan.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.114
- We can go to the
police tonight.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.518
- You can try, the sheriff's
totally out of his mind.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.887
He hasn't done a damn
thing to catch this guy.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.355
- Do they have any suspects?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.556
- No.

28:13.491 --> 28:15.526
Did you get a good
look at him last night?

28:15.528 --> 28:17.895
- No, I mean I caught
a glimpse of him

28:17.897 --> 28:22.299
when he grabbed me but
he was dressed like a...

28:22.301 --> 28:23.767
- like a clown.

28:31.676 --> 28:34.344
Look go to the police
station tonight,

28:34.346 --> 28:37.815
but anything
happens, you call me.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.317
If they can't take
care of you I will.

28:51.362 --> 28:54.665
- Em, I don't believe it.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.867
- Look he's a part of it okay,
he knows what's going on.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.103
- Em he's grieving, I could
have made something up

28:59.105 --> 29:00.537
and gotten the same response.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.106
- Well something isn't right.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.942
- So you think there's paranormal
circus clown after you?

29:04.944 --> 29:06.176
- No Heather I...

29:06.178 --> 29:07.911
- one that's just nice
enough to warn you

29:07.913 --> 29:09.213
before he attacks you?

29:09.215 --> 29:15.085
- That's not it.
- Well then what is it?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.754
- I'm an idiot, I'm sorry.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.222
- No you're not an idiot,

29:18.224 --> 29:20.023
I wasn't trying to
make you feel stupid.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.025
- I know.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.863
- You're just still a little
shaken up, that's all.

29:25.865 --> 29:26.930
- A little?

29:26.932 --> 29:30.534
- Listen we'll go home, we'll
call Jonah, have a drink,

29:30.536 --> 29:33.470
and we're just gonna
forget this ever happened.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.707
- Em look out, oh
my god look out!

29:47.586 --> 29:49.987
- It's, it's the sheriff.

29:49.989 --> 29:53.991
- Oh my god,
oh my god, the balloon.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.459
- What does it say?

29:55.461 --> 29:56.627
- It wasn't a tri...

30:12.944 --> 30:14.645
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

30:22.287 --> 30:24.254
Was your phone in there?

30:24.256 --> 30:25.522
Shit.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.791
Okay no one comes down
this road at night.

30:27.793 --> 30:29.026
- Heather that was him.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.861
That was the guy, that's
the guy, that was him.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.463
- Okay Emma I need you,
I need you calm okay.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.432
We're gonna walk home,
we're gonna call 9-1-1,

30:35.434 --> 30:38.001
it's closer than the
police station okay?

30:38.003 --> 30:40.771
Emma, I'm gonna take
care of you I promise.

30:40.773 --> 30:41.772
- Okay.

30:41.774 --> 30:43.607
- Okay, okay, let's go.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.843
Okay, okay, we're gonna go.

31:45.370 --> 31:48.105
- Emma, Heather?

33:33.011 --> 33:34.177
- Emma.

33:35.380 --> 33:38.181
Jonah.
- Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.449
- Hey.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.951
- God I don't think
he's breathing.

33:40.953 --> 33:42.119
- Is he dead?

33:42.121 --> 33:44.287
- Jonah, Jonah,
come on, come on.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.156
- Let's untie him.

33:46.158 --> 33:50.660
- Jonah, hey, hey,
look at me, you're okay, okay.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.562
It's okay, it's okay.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.973
Okay he took our cell
phones but he left

34:02.975 --> 34:04.307
my keys in the ignition.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.807
- He took my phone too.

34:05.809 --> 34:08.978
- He cut all the phone lines and I can't
get an Internet call going either.

34:08.981 --> 34:10.480
- Did he take anything else?

34:10.482 --> 34:11.547
- No, which is weird.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.717
- What was he doing here?

34:13.719 --> 34:16.652
- I don't know, I mean
maybe it wasn't the guy.

34:16.655 --> 34:20.489
- What do you mean,
Jonah this was definitely him.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.993
- I mean I didn't get a
good look at his face.

34:22.995 --> 34:24.393
Maybe it was just
a regular break in.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.563
- No Jonah I think this is it.

34:26.565 --> 34:30.333
- Whatever this is, we need
to go to the police station.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.536
- No we're gonna pack up and we're
gonna leave town right now.

34:32.538 --> 34:33.335
- No.

34:33.338 --> 34:34.938
- No, no, no he'll find us
like he did on the road.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.505
I think he's following us Emma.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.675
- No if we hide and the
police find him first,

34:38.677 --> 34:39.842
we'll be good.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.746
- Slow down okay, you both
are jumping to conclusions

34:42.748 --> 34:44.514
that we don't know.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.417
- I'm leaving town and whoever
wants to come with me can.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.952
- Emma wait, Emma.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.987
Hey are you all right?

34:53.190 --> 34:57.194
Listen I know you're scared
but we can figure this out.

35:20.418 --> 35:21.985
- What?

35:38.402 --> 35:39.503
What?

35:56.755 --> 35:59.923
- Ladies
and gentlemen, boys and girls

35:59.925 --> 36:05.762
put your hands together
for ribcage the clown!

36:08.600 --> 36:10.433
After he breaks her
neck, he'll famously

36:10.435 --> 36:13.303
snap her ribcage open
and eat her whole

36:13.305 --> 36:15.472
in less than 30 seconds.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.328
Who would like to be
our next volunteer?

36:38.330 --> 36:39.963
How about you young lady?

36:39.965 --> 36:41.898
- Oh why are you
doing this to me?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.867
- Ribcage
only performs with those

36:43.869 --> 36:47.137
most afraid of him and you
sweetheart, you're terrified.

36:50.475 --> 36:51.708
Good luck.

37:07.825 --> 37:08.925
- Emma?

37:11.329 --> 37:12.862
Thank god, I found her.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.198
- Oh Heather,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.733
- We were
looking everywhere for you.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.669
- I got really scared and
I ran off and I'm so sorry.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.004
But I'm so glad you're here.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.606
I'm so glad you're here.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.841
- Oh let's get you
to the police station okay?

37:24.843 --> 37:25.909
- Yeah.

37:27.378 --> 37:28.445
Okay.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.714
- Don't tell a soul about this

37:30.716 --> 37:32.682
and don't even think
about leaving town!

38:36.580 --> 38:38.982
- Daddy I can't eat anymore.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.852
You promised to protect me.

38:44.689 --> 38:47.324
This is all your fault.

38:49.427 --> 38:50.860
- I know what you are.

39:01.272 --> 39:03.106
- I told you not
to fuck with me!

39:38.175 --> 39:39.008
- Hey.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.310
- You all right?

39:40.312 --> 39:42.979
- Yeah, yeah, my car
broke down last night

39:42.981 --> 39:45.982
and I thought it would be safer
to wait here 'til morning.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.984
- What's wrong with
it, I can take a look?

39:47.986 --> 39:51.321
- No that's okay, can you
just give me a ride home?

39:51.323 --> 39:53.089
- Oh you really ought
to call somebody.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.724
- Please.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.459
- Okay fine.

40:04.502 --> 40:08.238
Sure, just put it
on my card, thanks.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.573
- So I got you a tow truck,

40:10.575 --> 40:13.009
and they're gonna take your
car to Wilson's garage.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.677
- Thanks pop's I'll
pay you back at work.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.079
- Nah don't worry about it.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.180
- Oh no you don't
have to pay for it.

40:17.182 --> 40:20.417
- I insist, just pay it forward.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.254
- You know I've never been
in an ice cream truck before.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.523
- Yeah it's pretty great.

40:26.525 --> 40:29.526
Helps bring in a little
extra money for the family.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.294
- What were you
doing out so early?

40:31.296 --> 40:34.364
- I took some ice cream
down to the police station.

40:34.366 --> 40:36.099
You know I'm just
trying to help out.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.436
- How is everything
going down there?

40:39.438 --> 40:40.937
- You don't know.

40:42.406 --> 40:45.275
The sheriff was
killed last night.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.245
To make matters
worse, Ken Randal

40:49.247 --> 40:51.781
that poor girl's father
has been down there

40:51.783 --> 40:53.450
throwing tantrums all morning.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.951
- About what?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.953
- I don't know, some kind
of paranormal garbage.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.826
Would you like a Clownsicle?

41:02.828 --> 41:05.228
- No, no thank you,
those are the worst.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.730
- Oh boy tell me about it.

41:07.732 --> 41:10.400
- Thank you again,
I really appreciate it.

41:10.402 --> 41:11.868
- You're welcome.

41:18.742 --> 41:20.643
Emma, wait.

41:21.445 --> 41:23.480
Here a regular one.

41:23.482 --> 41:24.814
- Thank you.

41:26.450 --> 41:29.185
- Did you talk to Ken Randal?

41:29.187 --> 41:33.289
- He came down to the
shop, and just told me

41:33.291 --> 41:35.758
what he thought was going on.

41:35.760 --> 41:41.164
- Okay, just be careful,
he's a little off.

41:41.166 --> 41:44.000
- Right, thanks.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.669
- Be safe.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.822
- Ladies
and gentlemen, if he thinks

42:05.824 --> 42:08.791
Clownsicles are bad wait
'til he sees the real thing.

42:08.793 --> 42:11.094
- No, no, Emma, no!

42:17.735 --> 42:20.370
- Oh my god, Emma you're okay.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.505
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

42:22.507 --> 42:24.374
- God Jonah and I were out
all night looking for you,

42:24.376 --> 42:25.874
where were you?

42:25.876 --> 42:28.678
- I'm sorry, my car
broke down and I thought

42:28.680 --> 42:30.480
it would be safer if I
stayed there 'til morning.

42:30.482 --> 42:32.315
- Okay, I'm just
glad you're okay.

42:32.317 --> 42:33.816
- Did you make it to
the police station?

42:33.818 --> 42:35.485
- Yeah Jonah's still down there.

42:35.487 --> 42:36.686
They searched the
house last night.

42:36.688 --> 42:38.521
- But they didn't find anything.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.924
- No, nothing, they put it
down as a regular break-in.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.158
- You don't believe that do you?

42:42.160 --> 42:45.161
- No, no, no, no,
no, but Jonah does.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.230
- He can believe
whatever he wants.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.566
The reality is, that
thing is gonna come back

42:49.568 --> 42:51.534
at some point tonight
whether we're ready or not.

42:51.536 --> 42:53.069
- I know, I know, they're
sending an officer

42:53.071 --> 42:54.469
to look over the house tonight.

42:54.471 --> 42:56.506
- No, no, no, no, we are
keeping them out of this okay,

42:56.508 --> 42:58.341
we're gonna handle this.

42:58.343 --> 42:59.676
- Why?

42:59.678 --> 43:00.910
- Because that thing is
just gonna go straight

43:00.912 --> 43:02.011
through the police officer okay,

43:02.013 --> 43:04.080
and neither of us
want to deal with that

43:04.082 --> 43:05.848
so I think that this
is our best option.

43:05.850 --> 43:07.684
- No Emma, they told us to
stay away from that guy.

43:07.686 --> 43:10.853
- Come on please Heather,
what else are we gonna do?

43:12.089 --> 43:15.525
- Fine, but if it doesn't work,
we go to the police, deal?

43:15.527 --> 43:17.260
- Deal, deal, great.

43:19.029 --> 43:20.363
- It doesn't
surprise me, they been

43:20.365 --> 43:21.864
telling me the same thing.

43:21.866 --> 43:23.733
Looking for a petty thief.

43:23.735 --> 43:25.468
- Maybe they're trying
to cover up something.

43:25.470 --> 43:27.971
- It doesn't matter, I'm
gonna hunt him down myself.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.238
- Do you know what
we're up against?

43:29.240 --> 43:32.208
- Yeah, he's been coming
here trying to stop me.

43:32.210 --> 43:34.410
I know something he
doesn't want us to know.

43:34.412 --> 43:35.378
- What?

43:35.380 --> 43:36.779
- He's demonic, he's possessed

43:36.781 --> 43:38.448
but there was never an exorcism.

43:38.450 --> 43:39.949
He's a paranormal
shit storm, but physically

43:39.951 --> 43:40.917
he's still human.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.452
- So if we shoot him?

43:42.454 --> 43:45.888
- When the demon leaves
his body and he's dead.

43:45.890 --> 43:47.423
- It sounds risky.

43:47.425 --> 43:49.559
- Look, he'll be on the
defense until 2:31 tonight,

43:49.561 --> 43:52.228
so I think the best bet
for you to stay here.

43:52.230 --> 43:54.764
When he comes for
you, I shoot him.

43:54.766 --> 43:57.667
- Okay but he could vanish
or he could take me.

43:57.669 --> 43:58.968
I mean he's possessed.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.136
- Look you could
either do this with me

44:00.138 --> 44:01.471
or face him on your own.

44:01.473 --> 44:02.572
- I can't, I can't do it.
- Emma please.

44:02.574 --> 44:03.906
- No, no, I'm not
gonna face him again.

44:03.908 --> 44:05.441
- What the hell else
you gonna do, huh?

44:05.443 --> 44:09.245
Don't be stupid, this
is your only chance.

44:09.247 --> 44:10.780
- I can't, I'm sorry, I can't.

44:10.782 --> 44:12.348
You can figure out
something else without me.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.583
Do it on your own.
- Emma.

44:13.585 --> 44:14.883
Emma wait, wait.

44:14.885 --> 44:17.420
Look I can't let you go,
you're all that I have left.

44:17.422 --> 44:19.288
I need you right now maybe
more than you need me.

44:19.290 --> 44:22.458
But I swear you're
safest with me.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.761
I'll protect you I promise.

44:26.096 --> 44:27.697
- I'm sorry.

44:27.699 --> 44:29.832
- Emma, Emma wait.

44:34.438 --> 44:35.471
- Drive.

44:35.473 --> 44:36.773
- Wait what happened?

44:36.775 --> 44:37.707
- Please I'm not doing
it, I'm not doing it.

44:37.709 --> 44:38.775
- What did he say?

44:38.777 --> 44:40.209
- He wants to make me bait.

44:40.211 --> 44:41.711
He wants to just put me
out there so that the clown

44:41.713 --> 44:43.613
can get me and then he'll
shoot the... I'm not doing it.

44:43.615 --> 44:44.614
- Emma, Emma...
- Please.

44:44.616 --> 44:45.481
- That's not a bad idea.

44:45.483 --> 44:46.683
- Heather drive.

44:46.685 --> 44:48.518
- I just think we
should talk about it.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.285
- Drive.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.287
- Okay.

44:57.127 --> 44:58.127
- You're insane.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.862
- It's dangerous.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.464
- Well fine, can
we at least go to

45:01.466 --> 45:02.999
the police station
like you promised?

45:03.001 --> 45:06.035
- No, please let's figure
out something else to do.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.370
- Really, like what?

45:07.372 --> 45:08.671
- You found her, where was she?

45:08.673 --> 45:10.506
- If we hide and then...

45:10.508 --> 45:13.309
- Emma you already tried hiding
and he found you, okay.

45:13.311 --> 45:14.811
This is our best option.

45:14.813 --> 45:16.679
- Look Heather, would you
put yourself out as bait?

45:16.681 --> 45:17.513
- I would.

45:17.515 --> 45:19.148
- Guys hold on a second.

45:19.150 --> 45:20.516
- No you wouldn't, okay.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.051
If you were in my
position, you would be

45:22.053 --> 45:23.986
out and trying to find
a place to hide, too.

45:23.988 --> 45:25.855
- No I wouldn't, nobody would.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.090
That's why we're
all so confused.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.932
We're trying to figure
out what is is you want.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.061
- What was that?

45:34.432 --> 45:36.132
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

45:39.436 --> 45:41.170
- What the hell is that?

45:41.172 --> 45:42.171
- I thought that
thing wasn't supposed

45:42.173 --> 45:43.106
to come back until tonight.

45:43.108 --> 45:44.373
- I don't know, I don't know.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.708
- Why isn't this opening?

45:45.710 --> 45:46.676
- 'Cause he probably
jammed it, so you have

45:46.678 --> 45:47.844
to smash the window Jonah.

45:47.846 --> 45:49.278
- No, no that will
get his attention,

45:49.280 --> 45:50.279
let's go out the back door.

45:50.281 --> 45:52.415
- You have to help me.

45:52.417 --> 45:53.916
- Just hide, hide.

47:07.091 --> 47:08.724
- Go, go.

47:24.474 --> 47:25.441
- Jonah get the door!

47:25.443 --> 47:26.309
- It's locked!

47:26.311 --> 47:27.410
It's locked!

47:28.946 --> 47:30.780
- Wait that was Mr. Randal.

47:30.782 --> 47:31.647
Mr. Randal?

47:31.649 --> 47:32.849
- Guys.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.183
- Guys I think Mr.
Randal is here.

47:34.185 --> 47:35.218
- Em!

47:43.293 --> 47:44.527
- Oh my god, open this door!

47:44.529 --> 47:45.628
- Jonah get the door open!

47:45.630 --> 47:46.963
- Come on!

47:46.965 --> 47:48.464
- Jonah!

47:49.466 --> 47:51.734
- Heather come on!

48:16.727 --> 48:18.928
- I'm not afraid of you.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.831
I'm gonna rip your
fucking head off!

48:24.435 --> 48:26.736
- Get back, back, get back!

48:27.838 --> 48:29.505
Get back!

48:52.729 --> 48:54.530
- Emma, Emma!

49:20.157 --> 49:21.424
- What's going on?

49:21.426 --> 49:23.392
- I don't know!
I don't know!

49:25.662 --> 49:26.796
- You okay?

49:26.798 --> 49:28.297
- Yeah he just stopped.
- What happened?

49:28.299 --> 49:30.733
- He just fell
over, I don't know.

49:30.735 --> 49:31.801
- He's dead.

49:33.737 --> 49:36.172
- I'm not going out there, I'm not going
out there until we know for sure.

49:36.174 --> 49:37.106
I don't know!

49:37.108 --> 49:38.307
- It's okay Emma, he's dead.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.976
- It's fine I promise.

50:11.842 --> 50:14.944
- Hey, what are you doing here?

50:14.946 --> 50:16.846
- The police were
driving me crazy.

50:16.848 --> 50:19.615
I just want to take
my mind off things.

50:19.617 --> 50:21.183
- Yeah, me too.

50:22.119 --> 50:24.487
Did you get a hold
of your parents?

50:24.489 --> 50:26.989
- They pretty much freaked
out when I told them

50:26.991 --> 50:28.457
and I fly home tomorrow morning.

50:28.459 --> 50:30.526
- I am too.

50:30.528 --> 50:31.994
I'm pretty sure my
parents are already

50:31.996 --> 50:34.630
signing me up for massive
amounts of therapy.

50:34.632 --> 50:36.098
- Yeah same here.

50:38.301 --> 50:42.805
Listen I'm... I'm really sorry
about the things I said earlier.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.473
- It's okay, it's really okay.

50:44.475 --> 50:46.909
- I know but I shouldn't
have said any of it

50:46.911 --> 50:49.812
and I'm just really sorry.

50:49.814 --> 50:52.515
- I said things I
shouldn't have too.

50:52.517 --> 50:54.083
I'm sorry.

50:56.153 --> 51:00.589
I just, I just really
wanted to keep you safe.

51:00.591 --> 51:01.591
- I know.

51:05.095 --> 51:09.298
- Just do me a favor and
try to keep your head up.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.400
- I will.

51:13.437 --> 51:15.004
- No that is for table 42.

51:15.006 --> 51:16.138
- Not anymore.

51:24.414 --> 51:25.414
- Boo.

51:27.584 --> 51:30.219
So I got a new phone.

51:30.221 --> 51:34.056
Phone place cut me a
deal if you want it, too.

51:34.058 --> 51:36.125
What, no comment?

51:36.127 --> 51:39.662
- I am respecting the
boss on his last day.

51:44.434 --> 51:46.135
- He's not coming back.

51:46.137 --> 51:49.238
- I'll believe that
at 2:31 A.M. tonight.

51:49.240 --> 51:53.876
- Em, you saw the
police take him away.

51:53.878 --> 51:57.279
- He's demonic okay, I
don't think it's that easy.

52:00.917 --> 52:05.387
- I get it you know,
the phobia thing.

52:05.389 --> 52:07.289
- How could you?

52:07.291 --> 52:10.126
- Because I had one too.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.928
- Of what?

52:12.930 --> 52:14.663
- Thunderstorms.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.432
- All kids are afraid
of thunderstorms.

52:16.434 --> 52:18.968
- Not until they're 17.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.738
- Well how did you get over it?

52:22.740 --> 52:24.773
- I figured I could
either spend the rest

52:24.775 --> 52:28.410
of my life hiding in a basement,

52:28.412 --> 52:31.247
or I could try and move on.

52:31.249 --> 52:34.250
And so far it's worked out.

52:34.252 --> 52:37.686
I haven't gotten struck
by lightning or anything.

52:39.422 --> 52:42.658
- Yeah well it's
easier said than done.

52:43.593 --> 52:44.660
- True.

52:46.363 --> 52:47.496
- Thank you.

52:48.932 --> 52:50.866
- What are managers for?

52:50.868 --> 52:53.002
- Manager for one more day.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.336
- Still your manager.

52:54.338 --> 52:55.638
- No, you know what the
next time she leaves

52:55.640 --> 52:57.940
I'm gonna ask to be
left in charge okay.

52:57.942 --> 52:59.542
To fulfill my life long dream.

52:59.544 --> 53:00.943
- Okay, god,

53:00.945 --> 53:02.511
then the whole corporation
would go under.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.113
- No it wouldn't.

53:04.115 --> 53:11.287
- You know what, as my
last act as manager,

53:11.289 --> 53:13.622
what if I let Heather
off and you two girls

53:13.624 --> 53:16.392
go home and I clean up shop.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.894
You look like crap anyway.

53:19.796 --> 53:23.732
- I will take you up
on that offer, jerk.

55:10.173 --> 55:11.573
- He's not coming back.

55:11.575 --> 55:14.310
- I'll believe
that at 2:31 A.M. tonight.

55:14.312 --> 55:18.747
- Em, you saw
the police take him away.

55:18.749 --> 55:22.751
- He's demonic okay,
I don't think it's that easy.

55:22.753 --> 55:24.420
- I can't let you go.

55:24.422 --> 55:25.821
You're all that I have left.

55:25.823 --> 55:27.589
I need you right now, maybe
more than you need me.

55:27.591 --> 55:30.859
But I swear you're
safest with me.

55:30.861 --> 55:32.961
I'll protect you, I promise.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.632
- It's all your fault.

55:36.634 --> 55:38.934
Daddy, I can't eat anymore.

55:39.769 --> 55:40.936
- Where's Sammy?

55:40.938 --> 55:42.304
- He probably just left,

55:42.306 --> 55:44.340
he'll come back he
always comes back okay.

55:44.342 --> 55:46.208
- I told you
not to fuck with me.

56:01.691 --> 56:04.059
- She was
talking about nightmares

56:04.061 --> 56:06.261
and paranormal encounters.

56:11.868 --> 56:13.302
- I was gonna
take her to the doctor

56:13.304 --> 56:15.237
but then on the exact date
and time on the balloon,

56:15.239 --> 56:16.872
she just...

58:33.476 --> 58:34.877
- pops?

58:47.323 --> 58:48.524
Fuck.

58:53.029 --> 58:54.863
Come on, come on, come on.

59:11.549 --> 59:12.549
Fuck.

59:22.158 --> 59:23.659
- Uh-oh
ladies and gentlemen,

59:23.661 --> 59:27.362
we did not expect to see
anyone out on the road tonight.

59:32.835 --> 59:35.704
We can't have you
ruining the show.

59:37.575 --> 59:38.807
- Fuck.

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.865
- Do you hear something?

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:04.700
- What?

01:00:04.702 --> 01:00:05.702
- Shh.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.707
- It's pops.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:12.975
- Pull over.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:23.385
- Pops, are you here?

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:24.453
- Help.

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.523
Help.

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.660
- Okay, we have to help him.

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:32.728
- No, I can't.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:33.895
- Emma please.

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.203
Emma, will you try?

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:52.314
Ribcage.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.930
Emma will you come
with me please?

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.501
Now please.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.374
You'd rather do
this the hard way?

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.111
Ribcage.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:25.281
Cease.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:30.886
Don't make me.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.358
That's better.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:41.329
Uh, Heather you might
want to stay here, go outside.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:44.466
You don't have to
but it'll be safer.

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:21.903
Emma...

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.475
Are you afraid of clowns?

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:29.911
I know.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.581
I am, too.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.183
It's miserable, isn't it?

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.585
Living in fear?

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:40.021
But Emma,

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:44.626
I want you to know
that in 15 minutes

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:51.032
at 2:31 A.M. this is
all gonna be over.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:55.103
We're gonna put you at peace.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.505
That sound good?

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.107
- You control him?

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.943
- Oh yes.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.781
Yes, demonic invocation, um...

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.085
Yeah that dusty old clown
is possessed by a demon.

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:12.687
He has been for about 30 years.

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:17.759
And thanks to a little
extra work on my part,

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:20.929
he's now a paranormal
force of nature,

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:23.298
completely under my control.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:29.304
Though lately he hasn't
been listening very well.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:35.243
Almost took my truck
a few hours ago.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:43.652
One of these days he's
gonna come after me, too.

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:48.089
Put me to rest and my
work here will be done.

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:49.491
- I don't need to
be put to rest.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:52.594
- Yes, oh yes, yes you do.

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:54.830
Yeah, no, I've been
doing this for long

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:58.333
enough to know,
you know, no one should have

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.502
to live in fear like we do.

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:09.477
No, no you see I seek out
people like you and I test them.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:13.315
I give them a balloon
and I see if they can

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:16.551
overcome their fears,
like your sheriff.

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:19.788
And we put him to rest
and he's so peaceful.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.356
You know you saw him.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.925
And Emma...

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.262
I want that for you, too.

01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:39.875
Ribcage.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:02.931
- We need to
go out the back door.

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:14.442
- Sweetheart you're
just proving my point,

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.611
you're terrified.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:19.014
I promise you, you'll feel
better when it's over.

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:21.116
- Please let us out, please.

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:22.918
- Shh, he's got
ears like a hawk.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.353
- I'll do anything,
I'll change, I promise.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:26.721
- Emma.

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:27.789
- I'll be stronger.

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:28.690
- Emma.

01:05:28.692 --> 01:05:30.959
- I'll leave you two alone.

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:20.408
- Heather look out.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:05.613
- This is all your fault.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:08.349
- No.

01:08:16.524 --> 01:08:18.593
- You did this to me.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:23.531
This is all your fault!

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:31.099
- Oh god I'm so sorry,

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.201
I thought he had gotten you.

01:09:33.203 --> 01:09:34.602
No, don't.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.609
- I thought he had you.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:44.212
- I lost him at the
very last second.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.881
We have to kill it.

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:48.783
- No, no.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:50.185
- It's the only way.

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:51.286
- I can't.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.621
- Yes you can.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.558
- No, we can smash a
window in the front,

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.859
we'll get out that way.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.529
- No if we break the
window he'll hear us

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:02.897
and it'll attract his attention.

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:04.465
He's faster than we are.

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:05.767
- I have to try.

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.548
Heather.

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:04.859
Heather.

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:08.096
- Emma.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.266
- Heather, what do you see?

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.229
- I told your friends
to stay out of the way.

01:11:41.231 --> 01:11:42.830
- Go Emma, go.

01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.233
- Aww, isn't that sweet.

01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:47.201
He's here to save you.

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:51.339
Or to take revenge or
it doesn't even matter.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:56.911
'Cause it's 2:30 and
you got two options.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:12:00.748
You can try to save
Robin hood here,

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.352
or you can take your chances
escaping out the back.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:07.121
If you make it, I promise
to leave you alone.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:08.756
- Run, Emma please.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.224
Run now.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.700
- Ooh, less than a minute.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:19.867
You better be quick.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:21.169
- Go, run.

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:29.577
- Aww,.

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:20.094
In all my years, I...

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.065
I never thought
anyone would do it.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.772
I wish I could
be like you, Emma.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:34.575
But I can't.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.253
- You okay?
