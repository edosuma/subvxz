20:19.261 --> 20:20.654
THAT'S AN ODD VEHICLE
TO STEAL, ISN'T IT?

20:20.697 --> 20:22.569
AND SUDDENLY YOU HAVE THE CASH
TO BUY A NEW TV?

20:22.612 --> 20:26.225
LISTEN, THE LONGER YOU LIE
TO US, THE WORSE IT'S GONNA BE.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.708
[sighs]

20:31.752 --> 20:34.842
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

20:34.885 --> 20:37.279
IT WASN'T STOLEN. [sighs]

20:37.323 --> 20:38.715
I SOLD IT.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.064
TO WHO?

20:40.108 --> 20:42.763
DON'T KNOW.
DUDE DIDN'T GIVE ME HIS NAME.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.765
DIDN'T WANT ME TO SIGN OVER
THE TITLE, EITHER.

20:44.808 --> 20:48.551
BUT HE GAVE ME A COUPLE
THOUSAND EXTRA,

20:48.595 --> 20:52.338
SO I WAS LIKE... [scoffs]
"ALL RIGHT."

20:52.381 --> 20:54.209
SO WHY'D YOU REPORT IT
STOLEN?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.864
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS
GONNA DO WITH THAT VAN.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.954
AND IT WAS STILL IN MY NAME.
MNH-MNH.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.869
DIDN'T WANT IT COMING BACK
ON ME.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.392
YOU NEED TO COME WORK
WITH OUR SKETCH ARTIST,

21:03.436 --> 21:05.612
SEE IF WE CAN GET
A LIKENESS OF THIS MAN.

21:05.655 --> 21:08.919
IFI HELP,

21:08.963 --> 21:11.835
CAN I KEEP THE TV?

21:13.315 --> 21:15.578
LET'S GO. [exhales]

21:15.622 --> 21:18.277
I WAS JUST ASKING. UGH!

21:25.458 --> 21:27.286
MA, I'M GOIN'!

21:31.464 --> 21:34.423
WE'VE SCRAPED TOGETHER
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN,

21:34.467 --> 21:36.251
AND WE'RE STILL
A MILLION SHORT.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.340
ISAAC'S TRYING TO SELL
SOME OF OUR ASSETS,

21:38.384 --> 21:41.430
BUT EVEN IF HE DOES, THE MONEY'S
NOT GONNA GET HERE IN TIME.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.259
WE'RE JUST... [sighs]
WE'RE AT A LOSS.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.566
EVEN IF BY SOME MIRACLE
WE DO GET THIS MONEY TODAY,

21:46.609 --> 21:48.785
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT HE'S NOT
STILL GONNA KILL GARY AND SLOAN?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.439
HONESTLY, YOU NEVER DO.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.485
THAT HAS TO BE A RISK
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE.

21:52.528 --> 21:55.357
NO, WE'RE WILLING.
OF COURSE WE'RE WILLING.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.751
[phone rings]

21:57.794 --> 21:59.666
THIS IS IT.

21:59.709 --> 22:03.278
[typing] [man] Gary and Sloan
are still alive.

22:03.322 --> 22:07.151
How long is up to you.
Is the money ready?

22:07.195 --> 22:09.937
[Lisbon] PELLA AND MARCUS
NEED MORE TIME. You're lying.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.809
THEY HAVE EVERY INTENTION
OF PAYING THE MONEY.

22:12.853 --> 22:16.117
Stop lying to me, bitch!
I know they have it!

22:16.160 --> 22:18.337
HEY, JUST FOR THAT,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE A DIME,

22:18.380 --> 22:19.816
NOT UNLESS YOU DO AS I SAY.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.818
What? SHUT YOUR MOUTH
AND YOU LISTEN TO ME.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.298
I NEED TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GONNA KILL THEM

22:23.342 --> 22:25.300
AFTER YOU GET THE CASH,
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.303
YOU'RE GONNA RELEASE ONE HOSTAGE
IN EXACTLY ONE HOUR.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.827
CONSIDER IT A SHOW
OF GOOD FAITH. Wait--

22:30.871 --> 22:33.352
YOU HEARD ME!
ONE HOSTAGE IN ONE HOUR.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.354
AND IF YOU DON'T,
DON'T BOTHER CALLING BACK!

22:37.356 --> 22:40.446
OOH. I THOUGHT THAT WAS
PRETTY CONVINCING.

22:40.489 --> 22:47.366
YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST
GOTTEN THEM KILLED.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.676
[phone rings]

22:53.720 --> 22:55.635
NO VIDEO CONFERENCE.
JUST A CALL.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.159
[ringing continues]

22:58.202 --> 22:59.682
[beep, static]

22:59.726 --> 23:01.684
HELLO?

23:01.728 --> 23:03.294
[horn honks, street sounds]

23:04.426 --> 23:06.036
THIS IS SLOAN DIETZ.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.516
I WAS TOLD TO CALL
THIS NUMBER.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.172
YEAH?Please.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.956
HELP ME.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.657
I'M NOT SURE
WHERE HE BROUGHT US.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.050
WE--WE WERE BLINDFOLDED.

23:20.094 --> 23:23.532
DID YOU HEAR ANY DISTINCTIVE
NOISES ON THE TRIP?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.578
AIRPLANES, TRAINS?

23:27.101 --> 23:29.190
I DON'T KNOW. I--

23:29.233 --> 23:31.192
I DON'T REMEMBER.
[sniffles]

23:31.235 --> 23:34.021
EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST.
I'M SORRY.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.937
IT'S FINE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.113
IT'S FROM A DESCRIPTION
OF THE KIDNAPPER.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.375
DO YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

23:40.419 --> 23:44.423
NO. HE NEVER LET US
SEE HIS FACE.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.991
[exhales]

23:49.602 --> 23:53.475
I'M NOT BEING VERY
HELPFUL AT ALL.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.738
I'M SO SORRY.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.915
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK?

24:03.485 --> 24:05.922
WE NEED TO FIND THE MONEY
TO GET GARY BACK.

24:05.966 --> 24:08.098
THAT'S WHAT THIS
COMES DOWN TO.

24:08.142 --> 24:10.318
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ISAAC?

24:11.493 --> 24:13.234
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN
THIS FAST.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.279
I'M DOING EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN, BUT...

24:15.323 --> 24:18.108
NOT EVERYTHING.
YOU COULD CHIP IN.

24:18.152 --> 24:21.329
I WANT TO, BUT...
A MILLION DOLLARS?

24:21.372 --> 24:23.723
THAT'S--THAT'S ALMOST
EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.333
PLEASE, ISAAC.

24:25.376 --> 24:29.555
SLOAN, DON'T THINK THAT
I DON'T FEEL FOR YOU. I DO.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.470
I WILL PAY YOU BACK.

24:31.513 --> 24:35.299
LOOK, I KNOW HOW RIDICULOUS
THAT SOUNDS...

24:35.343 --> 24:37.563
[sniffles] BUT I SWEAR--
TRUST ME--

24:37.606 --> 24:40.609
I WILL WORK EVERY DAY
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.655
I SWEAR IT.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.788
IT'S OKAY, SLOAN.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.573
I'LL PAY YOU BACK, ISAAC.

24:47.616 --> 24:50.271
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD FOR IT.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.012
PLEASE...

24:53.666 --> 24:55.494
DON'T LET HIM DIE.

24:58.627 --> 24:59.672
[exhales]

25:04.198 --> 25:05.939
WE HAVE THE MONEY.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.506
[man] Good.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.030
Now listen carefully.
I want it tomorrow.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.206
10:00 a.m.
at the Village Plaza.

25:12.249 --> 25:15.209
There's a table
by the pretzel cart.

25:15.252 --> 25:16.558
The wife will bring it there.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.865
SLOAN? THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.520
I won't let you have some undercover cop bring the money.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.001
This is non-negotiable.
Don't push me!

25:25.045 --> 25:26.829
WHEN CAN WE GET PROOF OF LIFE?

25:26.873 --> 25:28.657
9:00 a.m.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.138
If you disrupt the exchange,

25:31.181 --> 25:33.619
or if I see a cop
anywhere near that mall...

25:33.662 --> 25:37.361
[breathing nervously]I PROMISE, GARY IS
A DEAD MAN.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.842
[click]WHO'S GONNA TELL SLOAN?

25:39.886 --> 25:42.715
WELL, I THINK YOU GUYS
CAN HANDLE IT FROM HERE.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.329
HEY.

25:48.372 --> 25:51.375
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE DRIVER.

25:51.419 --> 25:52.855

25:52.899 --> 25:55.554
YEAH, IT MUST HAVE, UH,
SLIPPED MY MIND.[doors open]

25:55.597 --> 25:57.207
EXCUSE ME.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.253
HE KNOWS SOMETHING,
DOESN'T HE?

26:01.908 --> 26:03.736
JANE, LET ME HELP YOU.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.435
THANK YOU.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.680
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.640
WE HAVE THE MONEY
READY FOR YOU.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.643
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO...
[sighs] IS HAND IT OVER.

27:24.686 --> 27:25.774
PIECE OF CAKE.

27:25.818 --> 27:27.820
BE OUTSIDE IF YOU NEED ME,
OKAY?

27:35.828 --> 27:38.700

27:54.847 --> 27:57.545
HEY, BABY.[man] Hey.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.767
SO HOW'D IT GO?

28:01.810 --> 28:03.725
THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.814
ARE YOU SURE
THEY DON'T SUSPECT YOU?

28:05.858 --> 28:09.688
100%. WHAT ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS ABOUT, VINCE?

28:09.731 --> 28:12.821
WE NEVER MEANT FOR YOU
TO GET RELEASED THIS EARLY.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.128
AND WE NEVER MEANT
TO KILL THAT GUARD.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.999
WE'RE IMPROVISING,

28:17.043 --> 28:18.784
and I don't like that.

28:18.827 --> 28:21.656
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.702
YOU ALL SET FOR TOMORROW?

28:23.745 --> 28:24.964
[sniffles]WE'RE GOOD.

28:25.007 --> 28:26.792
JUST BRING THE MONEY
DOWN TO THE STORAGE BASEMENT

28:26.835 --> 28:28.489
AND I'LL GET IT OUT OF THERE.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.447
YOU'RE FORGETTING THE LAST PART.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.498
I DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM.

28:37.541 --> 28:38.586
[whimpers]

28:38.629 --> 28:42.329
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.723
PUT HIM ON FOR ME.

28:44.766 --> 28:45.854
I WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

PLEASE, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

29:03.872 --> 29:06.396
YOU COULD BE A LITTLE MORE
CONVINCING, GARY.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.877
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

29:08.921 --> 29:11.793
YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND,
DO YOU?

29:11.837 --> 29:14.796
But that's always been
your problem, Gary.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.539
YOU WASTED TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.715
YOU DRAGGED ME DOWN WITH YOU.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.239
NEVER AGAIN.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.447
IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.275

[Lisbon over earpieces]
Wait a minute. I see somebody

30:46.757 --> 30:48.716
who fits the description
of the kidnapper.

30:50.674 --> 30:53.982
It'd be early,
but I'm gonna get a closer look,

30:54.026 --> 30:55.549
see if it's him.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.987
It's definitely the kidnapper.

I'm going in.OKAY, I'M COMING.

31:12.609 --> 31:13.697

33:22.130 --> 33:24.176
SHE KNEW THINGS
MIGHT GO BAD.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.135
[beeping]

33:27.179 --> 33:29.181
THERE'S ONLY ONE NUMBER
ON THE PHONE.

33:29.224 --> 33:32.532
MUST BE THE KIDNAPPER'S.
[sighs]

33:32.575 --> 33:35.013
WE CAN TRACE THE PHONE'S
LOCATION, WE CAN FIND HIM.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.362
DO IT.

33:41.889 --> 33:46.067
[pressing keys
and clicking mouse]

33:46.111 --> 33:48.330
I GOT IT. THE KIDNAPPER'S
STILL IN THE MALL.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.550
LOOKS LIKE HE'S
IN THE STORAGE BASEMENT.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.993
POLICE! DON'T MOVE!

33:59.037 --> 34:01.126
GET DOWN ON THE GROUND!
DO IT NOW!

34:04.912 --> 34:08.742
[handcuffs clicking,
police radio chatter]

34:10.700 --> 34:12.180
[handcuffs rattle]

34:12.224 --> 34:13.703
TELL ME WHERE GARY IS.

34:13.747 --> 34:16.010
SCREW YOU!

34:16.054 --> 34:18.882
WE KNOW SLOAN'S BEHIND THIS.

34:18.926 --> 34:21.059
YOU WERE JUST HER PUPPET.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.061
NOW, WE MAY BE ABLE TO GO
A LITTLE EASIER ON YOU,

34:23.104 --> 34:26.194
BUT NOT UNLESS YOU HELP US
RIGHT NOW.

34:26.238 --> 34:29.110
IT'S OVER.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.069
DON'T BE STUPID.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.421
[sighs]

34:35.464 --> 34:37.031
HE'S IN A WAREHOUSE--

34:37.075 --> 34:39.599
9 NORTH CITRUS AVENUE.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.088
[creaking]

34:50.131 --> 34:52.829
[footsteps]

35:03.797 --> 35:05.973
[sighs]

35:07.670 --> 35:10.108
DON'T MOVE.
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

35:13.415 --> 35:16.244
[handcuffs rattling]

35:18.855 --> 35:21.119
[handcuffs clicking]

35:22.468 --> 35:24.122
HOW DID YOU...

35:28.691 --> 35:30.128
GET HER OUT OF HERE.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.658
[police radio chatter]

35:39.833 --> 35:41.487
GARY.

35:43.184 --> 35:46.318
[sighs and chuckles]

35:47.362 --> 35:50.713
[sighs]

35:52.628 --> 35:54.674
SO WE GOT SLOAN.MM.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.980
HOW DID WE KNOW SHE WAS
ONE OF THE KIDNAPPERS?

35:57.024 --> 35:58.939
WHILE WE WERE NEGOTIATING,

35:58.982 --> 36:01.202
VINCE HAD TO HANG UP
AND TALK TO SOMEBODY

36:01.246 --> 36:02.595
BEFORE MAKING
A COUNTEROFFER.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.336
WE FIGURED THAT PERSON
WAS THE MASTERMIND

36:04.379 --> 36:06.512
AND SOMEBODY WHO KNEW
THE GOODWINS WELL,

36:06.555 --> 36:09.167
SO JANE ASKED VINCE
TO RELEASE A HOSTAGE.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.604
WHOEVER HE RELEASED HAD TO
HAVE BEEN HIS COLLABORATOR.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.954
[snickers] AMAZING.

36:13.997 --> 36:14.955
WHERE IS JANE?

36:14.998 --> 36:17.305
ON A PERSONAL ERRAND.SHOOT.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.177
A FEW REPORTERS
WANTED TO INTERVIEW HIM.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.135
THIS IS TURNING INTO
A PRETTY BIG STORY.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.963
I COULD DO IT.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.922
YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT IT.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.239
[switch clicks]

36:38.283 --> 36:39.501
WELCOME HOME.

36:39.545 --> 36:41.547
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

36:41.590 --> 36:44.158
SORRY, I-I DIDN'T MEAN
TO ALARM YOU.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.247
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.554
I WILL IN A MOMENT,
BUT FIRST WE NEED TO TALK.

36:48.597 --> 36:51.034
IT'S... IT'S IMPORTANT.

36:51.078 --> 36:53.385
I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.214
THEN HAVE A DRINK
AND LISTEN.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.967
PLEASE.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.237
I THINK YOU'RE
IN TROUBLE, WALTER.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.239
[scoffs] WRONG.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.241
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.895
HELP ME? YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ME.

37:25.939 --> 37:28.333
I KNOW THAT YOU STILL
LOVE YOUR WIFE

37:28.376 --> 37:30.552
EVEN THOUGH SHE BROKE
YOUR HEART.

37:30.596 --> 37:33.251
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
VERY LONELY.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.255
I KNOW YOU'RE TORMENTED
BY SEXUAL DESIRES

37:37.298 --> 37:39.431
THAT YOU FEEL ASHAMED OF.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.303
I KNOW YOU LIKE SCOTCH.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.262
[swallows loudly]

37:45.437 --> 37:46.612
GET OUT.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.744
I'M TELLING YOU THIS
SO THAT YOU KNOW

37:48.788 --> 37:50.877
THAT IT'S POINTLESS
LYING TO ME.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.271
THE FBI MADE YOU
MOVE LORELEI

37:53.314 --> 37:55.534
BECAUSE THEY HAD
LEVERAGE OVER YOU, RIGHT?

37:55.577 --> 37:57.536
I SAID GET OUT!

37:57.579 --> 37:59.102
THEY HAD LEVERAGE OVER YOU

37:59.146 --> 38:01.757
BECAUSE OF A CRIME
THAT YOU COMMITTED.

38:01.801 --> 38:03.585
NO.

38:03.629 --> 38:07.807
THAT'S AS GOOD AS A "YES,"
WALTER.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.592
YOU RAPED A WOMAN,
DIDN'T YOU?

38:10.636 --> 38:12.594
NO!

38:12.638 --> 38:14.422
AN INMATE.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.817
THE FBI TOOK THAT INFORMATION,
AND THEY BLACKMAILED YOU

38:17.860 --> 38:20.298
AND MADE YOU TAKE LORELEI
ON A MYSTERY TOUR.

38:20.341 --> 38:22.909
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.128
YOU SAY THAT,
BUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING IS,

38:25.172 --> 38:26.826
"HOW DOES HE KNOW THIS?

38:26.869 --> 38:30.308
HOW CAN HE READ MY MIND?"

38:32.701 --> 38:35.313
AND, NO, HITTING ME

38:35.356 --> 38:37.227
WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

38:39.665 --> 38:42.363
[voice breaking]
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.629
I...

38:47.673 --> 38:50.328
I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.940
[gasps]

38:53.983 --> 38:55.681
I'M SO SORRY.

38:56.856 --> 39:01.643
WE ALL HAVE OUR WEAKNESSES,
WALTER.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.384
WHO CONTACTED YOU?

39:06.692 --> 39:09.042
A MAN CALLED ME
ON THE PHONE.

39:10.913 --> 39:12.611
I NEVER SAW HIM.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.352
NAME?

39:14.395 --> 39:17.311
NEMO.

39:17.355 --> 39:21.010
SAID HIS NAME WAS
FBI AGENT NEMO.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.665
OH, THAT'S CUTE.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.407
LATIN FOR "NOBODY."

39:26.451 --> 39:28.409
WHERE'D YOU TAKE LORELEI?

39:28.453 --> 39:30.629
I PROMISE I'LL NEVER
TOUCH ANOTHER INMATE.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.500
NEVER, I SWEAR!

39:32.544 --> 39:34.415
I BELIEVE YOU, WALTER.
WHERE DID YOU TAKE LORELEI?

39:36.286 --> 39:37.897
LOOK AT ME, WALTER.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.554
YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

39:44.512 --> 39:46.732
WHERE DID YOU TAKE LORELEI?

39:52.215 --> 39:54.043
OKAY.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.394
I'LL TELL YOU.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.492
[vehicle approaches]

40:07.535 --> 40:09.407
HE'S ALL YOURS.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.800
[police radio chatter]

40:17.458 --> 40:19.982
[engine starts]
