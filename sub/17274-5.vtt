Covert Affairs..

00:01.676 --> 00:02.843
Borz Altan--

00:02.860 --> 00:04.178
he did security work for me
for four months

00:04.196 --> 00:05.229
in Eastern Europe.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.031
The Altans somehow
had knowledge

00:07.065 --> 00:10.017
of our secret Chicago facility.

00:10.035 --> 00:12.019
Who planned the attack
in Chicago?

00:12.037 --> 00:15.456
I only knew him
as the Postman.

00:15.490 --> 00:17.041
The money was transferred
through a bank in Paris

00:17.075 --> 00:18.292
two days before the attack.

00:18.326 --> 00:20.244
That could lead us
to who funded the bombing.

00:20.295 --> 00:22.246
- What is your name again?
- Hayley Price.

00:22.297 --> 00:23.537
You ever served
in the military?

00:23.548 --> 00:24.548
No.

00:24.549 --> 00:25.532
Operated
in a hostile territory?

00:25.550 --> 00:26.750
Other than right here?

00:26.802 --> 00:29.086
I like to be in charge,
I hope that's okay.

00:29.137 --> 00:30.805
How much did you see?

00:30.839 --> 00:33.757
It doesn't take a spy
to connect the dots.

00:33.809 --> 00:36.894
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
charge you or anything.

00:36.928 --> 00:38.479
I never wanted
to break up with you.

00:38.513 --> 00:39.880
The CIA made me do it.

00:39.898 --> 00:42.233
I love you, Auggie.

00:42.267 --> 00:43.517
Natasha!

00:48.723 --> 00:51.909
Whoa.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.898
Oh...

00:57.916 --> 01:00.201
Hey. Get Auggie
on the line for me.

01:02.871 --> 01:05.405
As much as I know
you like being in control...

01:08.793 --> 01:11.545
I believe it's time
we start taking turns.

01:19.721 --> 01:22.056
Incoming call--Eric B.

01:23.642 --> 01:24.775
Incoming call--

01:24.809 --> 01:26.810
That's the lieutenant
of my hacker army.

01:26.862 --> 01:28.479
Then you'd better take it.

01:28.530 --> 01:31.699
Incoming call--Eric B.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.734
What is it?

01:37.072 --> 01:38.789
All right, I'll be right in.

01:41.276 --> 01:43.777
As much as I would love to
pick up where we just left off--

01:43.795 --> 01:46.914
- I'll drive you in.
- Thank you.

Hey, Auggie.

02:03.982 --> 02:05.683
You all right?

02:05.734 --> 02:08.068
Yeah, I'm just working out.

02:08.103 --> 02:10.070
You sure that's all it is?

02:10.104 --> 02:12.439
Fit as a fiddle.

02:12.473 --> 02:15.492
And thank you.
That's what friends are for.

02:15.527 --> 02:17.861
And you're welcome,
and I need you to come in.

02:17.913 --> 02:20.998
We've got a lead on the bank
that paid the Postman.

02:21.032 --> 02:22.416
I'm on my way.

02:43.054 --> 02:44.521
Hey, Arthur,
I need a favor.

02:44.556 --> 02:46.140
Good morning
to you too, Caitlyn.

02:46.174 --> 02:48.275
Good morning, Arthur.

02:48.310 --> 02:51.145
I forget that my directness
seems to bulldoze pleasantries.

02:51.179 --> 02:52.780
No, it's all right.
I'm getting used to it.

02:52.814 --> 02:54.315
I still need that favor.

02:54.349 --> 02:55.816
How can I help you?

02:55.850 --> 02:58.535
We have a security bid meeting
in Ramadi in two days.

02:58.570 --> 02:59.954
I'm happy to call
my Middle East contacts

02:59.988 --> 03:00.988
on your behalf.

03:01.022 --> 03:02.823
I need you
in that meeting with me.

03:02.857 --> 03:05.409
I thought Ryan was taking
the lead on that one.

03:05.460 --> 03:07.828
He's been beefing up our
domestic security initiative,

03:07.862 --> 03:10.414
since you made it rain
at Pierson's fund-raiser.

03:10.465 --> 03:13.367
- Then I'll be there.
- Wheels up at 0400.

03:13.385 --> 03:15.386
We're taking
one of the jets.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.648
A DNI investigator
has put in a request

03:27.682 --> 03:31.568
to discuss
the Chicago event with you.

03:31.603 --> 03:33.821
- Any headlines?
- Nothing specific just yet,

03:33.855 --> 03:35.189
but you know how this goes.

03:35.223 --> 03:37.024
They're looking
for someone to blame.

03:37.058 --> 03:39.193
Oh, these witch hunts
never get any easier.

03:39.227 --> 03:41.111
We can go over everything
as many times as you need

03:41.162 --> 03:42.746
before you meet with them.
Great.

03:42.781 --> 03:44.748
I've got nothing but work
on my plate these days.

03:44.783 --> 03:46.417
- Hey, Calder.
- Joan.

03:46.451 --> 03:49.903
Calder, I'd like you
to meet Lara Andrews.

03:49.921 --> 03:52.539
She works in the office
of the general counsel.

03:52.573 --> 03:55.292
- Nice to meet you, Lara.
- Likewise.

03:55.343 --> 03:57.761
Lara was stationed in Quito.

03:57.796 --> 04:00.080
You two should get together
and swap stories some time.

04:00.098 --> 04:01.965
Preferably some time
when I'm not headed

04:02.017 --> 04:03.384
to a meeting with the DCI.

04:03.418 --> 04:05.436
I'm headed in that direction.
I'll go up with you.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.304
- Pleasure meeting you.
- You too, Calder.

04:07.355 --> 04:09.556
Joan, I'll be in touch.

04:09.590 --> 04:12.559
Great. Thanks.

04:20.985 --> 04:22.101
You should ask Lara out.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.821
This is about what you saw
the other night.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.823
This is about circling
the wagons.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.991
We're under the DNI's
magnifying glass right now.

04:28.043 --> 04:29.660
I'm aware of that, Joan.

04:29.711 --> 04:31.829
Then you should also know that
we can't give them any reasons

04:31.880 --> 04:33.881
to fault our actions.

04:37.052 --> 04:39.837
Look, even if you don't hit
it off romantically with Lara,

04:39.888 --> 04:41.455
she's someone you want
in your corner.

04:41.473 --> 04:45.676
Fine.
I'll ask her out.

04:45.727 --> 04:47.561
Send me
her contact information.

04:47.595 --> 04:49.463
Will do.

04:55.403 --> 04:57.571
We know the money came
from Kredit Krepost--

04:57.605 --> 04:59.022
a private bank in Paris

04:59.074 --> 05:01.275
favored by oligarchs
and warlords.

05:01.309 --> 05:02.809
It's run by Ivan Kravec.

05:02.827 --> 05:05.696
Barber, pull him up, would you?
Yeah, you got it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.484
Now, he's former FSB.

05:10.502 --> 05:12.119
That explains
the bank's clientele.

05:12.153 --> 05:14.705
And the impenetrable code
protecting the bank's servers.

05:14.756 --> 05:16.323
A hack like this
could take months

05:16.341 --> 05:18.008
if we didn't already
have an in.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.493
What kind of in?

05:19.511 --> 05:23.013
The code's signature
belongs to Natasha Petrovna.

05:23.047 --> 05:25.215
The hacker virtuoso
ex-girlfriend.

05:25.266 --> 05:26.433
We know who she is, Barber.

05:26.468 --> 05:28.102
You have dated
the coolest chicks--

05:28.136 --> 05:30.020
present company
most definitely included.

05:30.054 --> 05:32.339
- Thank you, Eric.
- Yeah.

05:32.357 --> 05:33.524
Let me get this straight.

05:33.558 --> 05:36.310
You two want to ask
Natasha Petrovna,

05:36.344 --> 05:38.562
a fugitive
wanted by the FBI,

05:38.613 --> 05:39.897
to hack for us?

05:39.948 --> 05:41.615
Natasha wrote the open code

05:41.649 --> 05:43.567
that the bank
uses to protect its data,

05:43.618 --> 05:46.653
so she's the ideal person
to hack it.

05:46.687 --> 05:48.989
Petrovna's been on the run
for the past four years.

05:49.023 --> 05:50.541
How do you plan
on contacting her?

05:50.575 --> 05:52.659
I'll plant a message
on an underground cyber channel

05:52.693 --> 05:54.294
to set up a meet in Paris.

05:54.329 --> 05:55.746
Considering your history
with her,

05:55.797 --> 05:57.714
what makes you think
she'll even agree to see you?

05:57.749 --> 05:59.800
Well, I think
my history with her

05:59.834 --> 06:03.220
is exactly why she'll agree
to see me.

06:03.254 --> 06:04.671
I don't know what that means.

06:08.893 --> 06:12.146
Well, she said some things
the last time I last saw her.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.849
What kind of things?

06:19.103 --> 06:23.157
"I love you"
kind of things, okay?

06:23.191 --> 06:25.442
You're all right
with this tack, Annie?

06:25.493 --> 06:26.994
Natasha is our best shot

06:27.028 --> 06:28.662
at finding out
who funded Chicago.

06:28.696 --> 06:31.031
If Auggie thinks
he can get her to help,

06:31.065 --> 06:34.368
I think it's
the best course of action.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.253
All right.

06:36.287 --> 06:38.789
Looks like you're gonna be in
the field for this Op, Auggie.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.174
You're gonna need a handler.

06:40.208 --> 06:43.243
I'll do it.

06:43.261 --> 06:45.912
What do you say, Auggie?

06:45.930 --> 06:47.631
<i>Mais oui.</i>

07:02.930 --> 07:06.567
My coffee's pretty good.
How's yours?

07:06.601 --> 07:08.035
It's Paris.

07:08.069 --> 07:10.821
Are you okay?

07:10.872 --> 07:13.940
Sorry. It's just
I honestly never thought

07:13.958 --> 07:16.994
I'd see Natasha again.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.796
She's here.

07:19.831 --> 07:22.165
Auggie.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.386
Natasha.

07:26.421 --> 07:29.223
You look great.

07:29.257 --> 07:31.091
Come with me.

07:38.349 --> 07:41.968
You seem to have taken
my spy crash course to heart.

07:41.986 --> 07:43.737
I haven't had
much of a choice.

07:43.771 --> 07:46.857
You clearly
haven't changed a bit.

07:46.908 --> 07:48.692
That's not true.
My hair is longer.

07:48.743 --> 07:49.826
I'm surprised your employer

07:49.861 --> 07:52.913
would allow
such a rebellious statement.

07:52.947 --> 07:54.164
How have you been?

07:54.198 --> 07:55.815
How do you think?

07:55.833 --> 07:58.502
I've been on the run
since I saw you last.

07:58.536 --> 08:01.371
I never stay in one place
long enough to call it home.

08:01.422 --> 08:03.507
And I spend a lot of time
on trains,

08:03.541 --> 08:07.461
which you happened
to have ruined for me.

08:07.495 --> 08:09.630
I will take that
as a compliment.

08:09.664 --> 08:11.465
You should.

08:11.499 --> 08:12.766
Tash...

08:12.800 --> 08:14.668
I didn't ask you here
for personal reasons.

08:14.686 --> 08:16.053
I need a favor.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.554
What kind of favor?

08:17.605 --> 08:22.526
Kredit Krepost is using your
open code to protect its data.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.178
I knew it.
This is about some CIA mission.

08:25.196 --> 08:27.981
I need you to make a key
that will open a back door

08:28.015 --> 08:29.816
into the bank
security systems.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.451
I made that open code
for people who need

08:31.486 --> 08:33.654
to protect information
from prying agencies

08:33.688 --> 08:34.871
like the one you work for.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.456
Your open code
is protecting very bad people.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.325
Even if I did make you
a key to open a back door

08:38.359 --> 08:39.693
into the bank's security system,

08:39.711 --> 08:41.878
you'd have to access
the servers directly.

08:41.913 --> 08:44.864
And while I remember
you're good with your hands,

08:44.882 --> 08:46.633
you're not that good.

08:46.668 --> 08:48.552
- Tash--
- Don't "Tash" me.

08:48.586 --> 08:50.337
We're done here.

08:50.371 --> 08:53.006
And don't reach out
to me again.

09:11.183 --> 09:15.436
Auggie.

09:15.470 --> 09:18.189
Reunited, and it doesn't
feel so good.

09:18.223 --> 09:20.758
You've still got a shot.
You ruined trains for her.

09:20.776 --> 09:22.310
She's still angry.

09:22.361 --> 09:24.395
You're still on her mind.

09:24.429 --> 09:26.096
She took a big risk even
showing up here.

09:26.114 --> 09:27.315
You matter to her.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.816
That doesn't mean
she's gonna help.

09:28.867 --> 09:31.935
Being on the run
is an isolated existence.

09:31.953 --> 09:33.654
What she wants is connection.

09:33.705 --> 09:35.823
The emotional capital
you have with her,

09:35.874 --> 09:38.042
that is how we're gonna
convince her to help us.

09:38.076 --> 09:40.878
I'll make
a second approach.

09:40.912 --> 09:42.630
I put a GPS tracker
in her sleeve.

09:42.664 --> 09:45.383
So you knew
you still had a shot.

09:45.417 --> 09:46.801
I never give up...

09:46.835 --> 09:49.620
A lot like
someone else I know.

09:49.638 --> 09:51.339
Speaking of,
did you hear her say

09:51.390 --> 09:53.557
we can't hack into the bank's
servers from the outside?

09:53.592 --> 09:55.509
Yeah,
but I'll find a way in.

11:33.942 --> 11:36.444
Where are you off to?

11:36.495 --> 11:38.245
You know I'm not
at liberty to say.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.447
McQuaid Security
certainly takes

11:39.498 --> 11:41.832
their confidentiality
agreements seriously.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.419
As seriously as Langley
takes theirs.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.037
We know the drill
all too well.

11:47.071 --> 11:49.006
I'll ask you questions
I know you can answer.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.841
How long?
A couple of days.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.076
I haven't even left yet,
and I already miss Mack.

11:53.094 --> 11:54.512
Yeah, well, that's natural.

11:54.546 --> 11:57.264
It's your first time away
since he was born.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.183
Who's going with you?

11:59.217 --> 12:01.084
You know that's a question
I can't answer.

12:01.102 --> 12:02.386
Caitlyn.

12:02.420 --> 12:05.856
And you know you have
nothing to worry about.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.775
My guard is up.

12:07.809 --> 12:09.944
Not just yet, I hope.

12:25.293 --> 12:26.577
Tash!

12:29.798 --> 12:32.633
What is this? Did you use
your spy bullshit to find me?

12:32.667 --> 12:34.885
Uh, yeah, I did, actually.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.954
It's--it's in your sleeve.

12:36.972 --> 12:39.673
Sorry.

12:39.724 --> 12:43.394
Can I come in?
I'm alone.

12:43.428 --> 12:47.014
I'm leaving,
so make it quick.

12:47.065 --> 12:49.984
Listen, I, uh...

12:50.018 --> 12:52.152
I don't want you
leaving Paris angry with me.

12:52.187 --> 12:53.521
It's a little late
for that.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.656
I know.
And I'm sorry I upset you.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.192
I-I shouldn't have put you
on the spot with a work favor

12:58.243 --> 13:00.327
when there's so much left
unsaid between us.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.862
What else is there to say?

13:01.913 --> 13:05.366
Well, I'm trying--

13:05.417 --> 13:08.619
your hacks come across my desk
from time to time--

13:08.653 --> 13:10.754
Nexnet, Cynder...

13:10.789 --> 13:14.291
Incredible, elegant code work.

13:14.325 --> 13:19.346
And when I read it, I think
about how brilliant you are.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.215
And...

13:25.887 --> 13:27.721
I miss you.

13:35.780 --> 13:37.648
Sometimes I wonder
what life would have been like

13:37.682 --> 13:39.450
if you jumped
off that train with me.

13:42.621 --> 13:46.407
I wanted to.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.826
But I'm here now.

14:40.062 --> 14:44.099
Incoming call--Hayley.

14:44.390 --> 14:46.090
Incoming call--Hayley.

14:46.124 --> 14:49.811
Who's that--
your girlfriend?

14:49.845 --> 14:51.179
Infatuated Auggie groupie?

14:53.265 --> 14:56.568
It's--it's just--
it's a work thing. It can wait.

15:01.407 --> 15:04.192
I'll do it.

15:04.243 --> 15:05.693
You'll do what?

15:05.744 --> 15:07.612
I'll build you a key.

15:07.646 --> 15:09.581
Oh.

15:09.615 --> 15:12.700
But I have terms.

15:12.751 --> 15:14.285
All right, what are they?

15:14.319 --> 15:17.005
I want the FBI charges
against me dropped.

15:17.039 --> 15:18.656
I'm tired of running,

15:18.674 --> 15:20.758
and I want to return
to the states.

15:23.963 --> 15:25.880
That's a tall order,
but I'll--

15:25.931 --> 15:28.883
I can have Langley talk
to the FBI,

15:28.934 --> 15:32.220
work something out.

15:32.271 --> 15:35.440
That's not all.

15:35.474 --> 15:37.358
What else?

15:37.393 --> 15:41.362
I want your complete honesty
from here on out--no lies.

15:46.652 --> 15:48.319
You have my word.

15:48.353 --> 15:50.538
Then we have a deal.

16:11.477 --> 16:13.761
-<i> Bonjour.</i>
-<i> Salut.</i>

16:16.265 --> 16:18.382
Are we clean?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.652
Yeah.

16:20.686 --> 16:22.570
How'd it go with Natasha?

16:22.605 --> 16:24.221
Good. She's gonna
build the key

16:24.239 --> 16:25.857
in exchange
for us getting the FBI

16:25.891 --> 16:27.525
to drop the charges
against her.

16:27.559 --> 16:31.529
I will put in a call to Calder
and get that ball rolling.

16:31.563 --> 16:34.082
I knew you could get her
to help us.

16:34.116 --> 16:35.833
For the record,
I didn't go over there

16:35.868 --> 16:37.001
planning to spend the night.

16:37.036 --> 16:39.287
You don't have
to explain yourself to me.

16:39.338 --> 16:41.539
You did
what was necessary.

16:43.425 --> 16:46.711
Do you want to talk
about it?

16:46.745 --> 16:49.413
Can we can talk about it?

16:49.431 --> 16:51.432
Yeah, we can talk
about it.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.184
All right.

16:53.218 --> 16:55.720
Remember Hayley
from Pierson's gala?

16:55.754 --> 16:57.605
We've been dating.
I like her.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.891
But this thing
with Natasha--

16:59.925 --> 17:01.476
we still have a connection.

17:04.730 --> 17:07.431
The work we do,
the emotions--

17:07.449 --> 17:09.983
it's a thin line.

17:10.035 --> 17:12.954
But it doesn't mean
you can't complete the mission.

17:16.075 --> 17:17.709
Thanks.

17:17.742 --> 17:20.494
That's what friends are for.

17:20.546 --> 17:22.664
How'd it go at the bank?

17:22.714 --> 17:26.000
Well, the bad news is
I can't get in.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.002
But the good news is
I think I found an easier path.

17:28.053 --> 17:31.222
Ivan carries a laptop-sized,
metal briefcase

17:31.256 --> 17:33.057
with a
fingerprint-recognition pad.

17:33.092 --> 17:34.458
That's our way in.

17:34.476 --> 17:36.844
The only reason he'd be carrying
a briefcase like that

17:36.895 --> 17:39.430
is if he's using it to access
the bank's data remotely.

17:39.464 --> 17:41.599
I was hoping you'd say that.

17:41.633 --> 17:43.067
So tell me
about Natasha's key.

17:43.102 --> 17:46.020
It's a flash drive
with encrypted code on it.

17:46.071 --> 17:47.304
Plug it into the laptop.

17:47.322 --> 17:49.490
It uploads a tap
that allows us to access

17:49.525 --> 17:52.309
and track
all the bank's data.

17:52.327 --> 17:55.530
How are you gonna get
to Ivan's laptop?

17:55.581 --> 17:57.415
Get close,
look for an opportunity.

17:57.449 --> 17:59.617
- He has a security detail.
- I know.

17:59.651 --> 18:02.670
Are you sure that targeting
a former Russian spy

18:02.705 --> 18:04.956
is the path
of least resistance?

18:04.990 --> 18:06.457
It's the only path we have.

18:28.397 --> 18:30.064
I can't understand
what you're saying.

18:30.115 --> 18:32.850
Nice shooting.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.819
I see the shots,
and I take them.

18:34.853 --> 18:37.822
What's your name,
American sharpshooter?

18:37.856 --> 18:38.990
Martine Miller.

18:39.024 --> 18:41.159
Pleasure to meet you,
Martine Miller.

18:41.193 --> 18:43.161
I'm Ivan Kravec.

18:43.195 --> 18:45.046
What brings you to Paris?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.665
The hunting France exposition.

18:47.699 --> 18:49.884
I'm a sales rep
for Browning.

18:49.918 --> 18:52.170
I hear you make
good shotguns.

18:53.538 --> 18:56.174
We make the best shotguns.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.559
Tell me, Martine Miller,

18:58.594 --> 18:59.977
why would you use
a rented gun

19:00.012 --> 19:02.897
when you work
in the hunting industry?

19:02.931 --> 19:04.882
To test my skills.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.818
In what way?

19:06.852 --> 19:08.770
Any decent marksman
can hit the target

19:08.821 --> 19:11.489
with the gun
he uses every day.

19:11.523 --> 19:12.690
I like a challenge.

19:15.778 --> 19:17.728
I have a gun collection
at the lodge

19:17.746 --> 19:20.198
which you might appreciate.

19:21.900 --> 19:25.369
Would you like to see it?
I'd love to.

19:36.581 --> 19:38.216
- What do you think?
- Let's call Ryan.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.467
- Why?
- Run it by him.

19:39.518 --> 19:41.752
We're here to make
the decision for him.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.638
Do you think we should take him
the bid at $10 million?

19:43.689 --> 19:45.923
- I do.
- Then we make the deal.

19:45.941 --> 19:47.692
It's that simple?

19:47.726 --> 19:49.927
It is when you
don't have to cut

19:49.945 --> 19:52.780
through Langley's red tape.

19:52.815 --> 19:54.565
Oh, I could get used
to simple.

19:57.786 --> 19:59.537
We hammered
that deal out quickly.

19:59.571 --> 20:00.771
Things happen fast

20:00.789 --> 20:02.429
when you don't have to jump
through hoops.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.659
And the Arthur Campbell touch
certainly didn't hurt.

20:04.710 --> 20:06.160
Ah, it was a team effort,
Caitlyn.

20:06.211 --> 20:07.962
Don't be so modest, Arthur.

20:07.996 --> 20:09.797
Ryan told me
you'd be great in a room.

20:09.832 --> 20:13.167
I just didn't believe him until
I saw you in action firsthand.

20:13.218 --> 20:14.886
Is there anything
you don't do well?

20:18.807 --> 20:22.426
I don't let things
get complicated.

20:22.460 --> 20:24.312
Good to know.

20:46.519 --> 20:49.604
Drive!
Get as close as you can!

20:51.364 --> 20:54.483
Watch your 5s and 25s.
Let's go.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.057
Go! Go!

21:22.696 --> 21:24.396
Go! Let's go!

21:26.516 --> 21:28.534
Go!

21:43.249 --> 21:45.167
- Thank you.
- This way, Martine.

21:51.224 --> 21:52.841
After you.

22:01.551 --> 22:03.986
You like my Fedorov?

22:04.020 --> 22:05.938
What's not to like?

22:05.989 --> 22:07.856
It's the world's
first assault rifle.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.892
Some Germans
would disagree with you.

22:10.910 --> 22:14.729
They'd be wrong.

22:14.748 --> 22:19.701
1916--that's one
of the first ever made.

22:19.735 --> 22:22.704
- You know your trade.
- It's my job.

22:24.958 --> 22:29.044
If you were open to collecting
American-made firearms,

22:29.078 --> 22:32.548
I could help you diversify.

22:32.582 --> 22:34.266
Since you are in sales,

22:34.300 --> 22:37.419
you must be very skilled
at reading people.

22:37.437 --> 22:39.087
Hmm?

22:39.105 --> 22:42.391
- Not really.
- No?

22:42.425 --> 22:45.194
The great thing about guns
is that they sell themselves.

22:45.228 --> 22:47.396
Hmm.

22:51.034 --> 22:53.202
I see a shot.

22:53.236 --> 22:56.605
What do you think,
Martine, hmm?

22:56.623 --> 22:59.408
Should I take it?

23:03.746 --> 23:06.131
You're misusing your Lobaev.

23:06.166 --> 23:08.333
It's meant
for long-range precision.

23:10.753 --> 23:14.223
But if you want
to take a shot...

23:14.257 --> 23:17.259
Aim here.

23:25.351 --> 23:28.187
I like what you're made of.

23:32.358 --> 23:35.810
Will you join me for dinner
at my house tonight?

23:35.829 --> 23:38.580
I wouldn't miss it.

23:45.088 --> 23:49.291
Incoming call--Hayley.

23:49.325 --> 23:51.793
Incoming call--Hayley.

23:51.827 --> 23:54.296
- Hey.
- Hey, handsome.

23:54.330 --> 23:56.014
You want to meet up
for dinner later?

23:56.049 --> 23:57.716
I can't.
Sorry.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.551
I got to pull
an all-nighter at work.

23:59.602 --> 24:03.355
Okay. I'll call you later
when you come up for air.

24:03.389 --> 24:07.192
Yeah, that sounds good.
I got to go.

24:18.371 --> 24:21.740
Someone's earned a break.
Mmm. That smell.

24:21.791 --> 24:23.158
Bacon tarts?

24:23.192 --> 24:24.359
Very good.

24:26.212 --> 24:29.531
You remembered how much
I hate those things.

24:29.549 --> 24:32.834
There you go.

24:32.868 --> 24:35.087
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

24:35.138 --> 24:36.922
I've already agreed
to help you, Auggie.

24:36.973 --> 24:39.258
You don't have to spoil me.

24:39.309 --> 24:42.844
I'm not spoiling you,
I'm keeping you well fed.

24:42.878 --> 24:46.815
You probably think
I have expectations of you,

24:46.849 --> 24:49.268
of us, but I don't.

24:49.319 --> 24:51.052
I don't believe
in fairy tales.

24:51.070 --> 24:54.055
Well, I don't think anyone's
gonna confuse our story

24:54.073 --> 24:55.407
with a fairy tale.

24:55.441 --> 24:57.910
It has
a certain romance, no?

24:57.944 --> 24:59.945
Well, then maybe
you should be getting ready

24:59.996 --> 25:01.446
for your happy ending.

25:03.399 --> 25:05.117
Now you're just toying
with me.

25:05.168 --> 25:06.401
No, I'm serious.

25:06.419 --> 25:07.786
You should be thinking
about where you want to go

25:07.837 --> 25:11.173
when you get
back to the states.

25:11.207 --> 25:13.508
Do you remember that park
where we used to picnic,

25:13.543 --> 25:15.844
near the water?

25:15.878 --> 25:18.847
- The tidal basin?
- That's where I want to go.

25:18.881 --> 25:21.216
I want to sit on a blanket
for the whole day.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.802
I've spent
so much time running.

25:23.853 --> 25:27.105
Now I want to stay
in one place and be still.

25:31.361 --> 25:34.062
You've changed.

25:34.096 --> 25:36.031
Are you going to take me
to the damn park or not?

25:36.065 --> 25:38.650
Yes, I'll take you
to the damn park.

25:38.701 --> 25:40.769
You gonna eat
a damn bacon tart or not?

25:48.044 --> 25:50.996
Thank you for pulling my ass
from the flames, sir.

25:51.047 --> 25:52.781
Ah, you would've done
the same thing for me.

25:52.799 --> 25:54.333
And call me Arthur.

25:54.384 --> 25:55.917
Excuse me.

25:58.388 --> 26:01.173
Are you okay?

26:01.224 --> 26:03.625
I know for a fact
you're not the drink-alone type.

26:03.643 --> 26:06.511
I'm fine.

26:06.562 --> 26:08.347
You were brave today...

26:08.398 --> 26:09.514
When it mattered.

26:09.565 --> 26:12.684
Your cover fire
had the insurgents pinned down

26:12.735 --> 26:15.020
and kissing sand.

26:15.071 --> 26:18.657
Lots of target practice--
perk of working for McQuaid.

26:18.691 --> 26:21.643
That and surviving
the occasional firefight.

26:29.502 --> 26:30.985
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, Mr. Michaels.

26:31.004 --> 26:32.654
I tried to explain
that you were unavailable.

26:32.672 --> 26:36.174
It's okay.
Close the door behind you.

26:36.209 --> 26:38.760
- How can I help you, Joan?
- Why did you stand Lara up?

26:38.795 --> 26:41.346
I did not stand her up.
I called and canceled.

26:41.381 --> 26:42.831
An hour
after you were supposed

26:42.849 --> 26:44.165
to meet her
at the restaurant.

26:44.183 --> 26:45.667
Joan, you of all people know
what this job requires.

26:45.685 --> 26:47.102
I got caught up.

26:47.136 --> 26:48.854
Yeah, or you blew her off
because she's not someone

26:48.888 --> 26:50.972
you can pull into a coatroom
and have your way with.

26:51.006 --> 26:54.393
You have no idea
what you saw the other night.

26:59.315 --> 27:02.200
You care for that woman.

27:09.709 --> 27:13.027
We are under siege,

27:13.046 --> 27:15.363
and she is a liability...

27:15.381 --> 27:17.332
Now more than ever.

27:24.006 --> 27:26.675
What do you want, Joan--
my job?

27:29.178 --> 27:32.380
If I wanted your job,
I would sit back,

27:32.398 --> 27:35.517
say nothing,
and watch you get fired.

27:35.551 --> 27:37.319
So what's your angle?

27:37.353 --> 27:39.888
I need an ally
more than an angle.

27:39.906 --> 27:41.389
And you're gonna
need one, too,

27:41.407 --> 27:43.775
if you want to stay
in this office.

27:47.062 --> 27:49.698
Tony Lucca from the FBI
is on the line.

27:57.373 --> 27:59.841
I'll put him on speaker.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.511
Hey, Tony, what's the word

28:02.545 --> 28:05.430
on dropping the charges
against Petrovna?

28:18.144 --> 28:19.728
Hey, Auggie.

28:19.762 --> 28:23.115
Hey. You get everything
for your date with Ivan?

28:23.149 --> 28:25.484
Everything
except Natasha's key.

28:25.535 --> 28:28.737
It's ready to go. I just need
to pick it up from her.

28:28.771 --> 28:30.989
I talked to Calder.

28:36.829 --> 28:39.297
It's not going to happen.

28:39.332 --> 28:41.049
Sorry.

28:42.502 --> 28:45.504
You know you can't tell her
until we get the intel.

28:47.590 --> 28:51.176
That's not how I want
to play this.

28:51.227 --> 28:54.813
- Do you have another idea?
- Yeah.

28:54.847 --> 28:57.149
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

29:00.686 --> 29:03.989
The deal we made was the key
for her immunity.

29:04.023 --> 29:06.641
If you tell her what's going on,
we don't get the key,

29:06.659 --> 29:08.142
and this whole
mission blows up.

29:08.161 --> 29:09.494
I just need
more time with her.

29:09.529 --> 29:10.969
Yeah, well,
you don't have more time.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.497
Ivan leaves in the morning.

29:12.532 --> 29:15.316
Annie, I'm not gonna lie
to her. I don't have to.

29:15.334 --> 29:17.252
So you told her
about Hayley?

29:17.286 --> 29:19.171
No.

29:19.205 --> 29:22.824
Kind of.

29:22.842 --> 29:26.678
As your friend, I understand
how difficult this is.

29:26.712 --> 29:28.213
But as your handler,

29:28.264 --> 29:30.832
you know I have to remind you
that you can't let your feelings

29:30.850 --> 29:32.968
influence the mission.
They're not.

29:33.002 --> 29:34.469
So you know
what you have to do.

29:34.503 --> 29:38.673
I will find another way.
I can handle this.

29:38.691 --> 29:40.308
Auggie, don't forget
why we're here,

29:40.342 --> 29:42.010
not when we're so close
to figuring out

29:42.028 --> 29:43.278
who paid for the Postman--

29:43.312 --> 29:45.146
So that we can get
justice for Charlie

29:45.180 --> 29:47.449
and the 11 others
we lost in Chicago.

29:47.483 --> 29:50.569
I haven't forgotten
why we're here.

30:06.754 --> 30:08.221
I heard that.

30:08.256 --> 30:10.090
You know I can't see
what you're looking at, right?

30:10.141 --> 30:12.092
I forget sometimes.

30:12.143 --> 30:16.179
- What were you looking at?
- Nothing.

30:16.213 --> 30:18.815
You want your key?

30:18.850 --> 30:21.935
There's something
you need to know.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.521
What's wrong?

30:24.555 --> 30:27.240
The Agency couldn't get
the charges against you dropped.

30:32.730 --> 30:34.698
Then you don't get
your key.

30:34.732 --> 30:38.735
Look, I know you and I have
always had different beliefs

30:38.753 --> 30:40.203
when it comes to ethics,

30:40.237 --> 30:42.973
but you have never believed
in protecting murderers.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.175
Why should I help people
who can't help me?

30:45.209 --> 30:47.878
Because I'm asking you to.

30:47.912 --> 30:49.880
And you can trust me.

30:51.582 --> 30:52.799
Please leave.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.894
I don't want to leave.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.850
- Liar!
- What? What is going on?

31:43.901 --> 31:45.402
Don't play games with me!

31:45.436 --> 31:47.470
What games?
What are you talking about?

31:47.488 --> 31:49.022
You know my key
has been stolen!

31:49.073 --> 31:50.473
- Your--
- I can't believe

31:50.491 --> 31:52.809
I was stupid enough
to trust you.

31:52.827 --> 31:54.578
Every word that came
out of your mouth was a lie!

31:54.612 --> 31:55.779
Tash, that is not true.

31:55.813 --> 31:57.114
Stop!

31:57.148 --> 31:58.915
I can't handle hearing
any more of your bullshit.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.201
- It's not--
- All this was a distraction

32:01.252 --> 32:03.370
so one of your spooks
could steal my key.

32:03.421 --> 32:06.489
No. No!
Natasha, listen to me.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.041
I am done listening to you!
Get out!

32:08.092 --> 32:09.926
No, listen to me!
It is not what you think!

32:09.961 --> 32:12.662
Get out! I don't--I don't
want to see you again!

32:12.680 --> 32:15.048
- Tash!
- I never want to see you again!

32:15.099 --> 32:17.267
Tash!

32:38.039 --> 32:40.190
I hope
I didn't keep you waiting.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.691
You're worth the wait.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.526
Hmm?

32:43.544 --> 32:46.580
I would like
to show you something.

32:49.917 --> 32:53.720
You have quite a collection.
Yeah.

32:56.974 --> 33:00.594
What century is this one?

33:01.729 --> 33:04.714
Who are you really,
Martine Miller?

33:04.732 --> 33:06.066
Huh?

33:08.052 --> 33:11.438
Who do you think I am...

33:11.489 --> 33:13.073
Someone who likes it rough?

33:14.692 --> 33:17.360
I was hoping so, huh?

33:26.454 --> 33:27.621
You need to catch up.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.539
Force me.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.744
Ahh.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.730
Choke me.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.236
Yes.

34:01.072 --> 34:02.122
Yes.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.746
Ahh.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.059
I got the intel.

35:46.093 --> 35:48.428
No shit.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.230
You didn't even give me
a chance to convince her.

35:50.264 --> 35:53.183
I did give you a chance,
but instead of convincing her,

35:53.217 --> 35:55.485
you slept with her.
I just needed more time.

35:55.519 --> 35:57.854
There was no more time.

35:57.888 --> 35:59.889
This was my one shot
with Ivan,

35:59.907 --> 36:02.108
and now we have a lead
that can help us track down

36:02.159 --> 36:03.360
whoever killed 12 Americans.

36:03.394 --> 36:05.028
Yeah, I know we needed
the intel, Annie.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.613
That's not the point.
So what is the point?

36:06.664 --> 36:08.698
The point is my friend
violated my trust,

36:08.732 --> 36:10.700
and I would never do that
to you.

36:15.172 --> 36:17.173
I only did that
because you were compromised.

36:17.208 --> 36:20.343
I always choose you
over the mission...

36:20.378 --> 36:22.545
Always...

36:22.579 --> 36:24.464
Even if it means hiding
your medical condition

36:24.515 --> 36:27.267
from the Agency,
which could get me fired.

36:27.301 --> 36:29.936
I choose you.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.889
But you?

36:32.923 --> 36:36.109
Well, you choose the mission.

36:36.143 --> 36:39.362
And you think that makes you
better at what you do.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.267
But the truth is, turning
your back on your emotions

36:44.285 --> 36:46.820
doesn't make you a better spy.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.489
It's just cutting you off
from anyone close to you.

37:18.109 --> 37:19.760
You probably
don't remember me.

37:19.778 --> 37:22.980
We met in D.C.
four years ago.

37:23.031 --> 37:24.698
At the Datatech conference.

37:24.733 --> 37:26.450
You're Auggie's
seeing eye dog.

37:26.484 --> 37:29.936
How did you find me?
I bugged your cell phone.

37:29.954 --> 37:32.072
When you stole my key.

37:32.106 --> 37:35.776
I did that without Auggie's
knowledge or consent.

37:35.794 --> 37:37.127
Why should I believe you?

37:37.162 --> 37:38.829
You lie to people
for a living.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.281
That's true of me,
but not of him.

37:41.299 --> 37:44.051
We both know he's the kind
of guy that keeps his promises.

37:44.085 --> 37:45.469
He put you up to this.

37:45.503 --> 37:48.222
- He doesn't even know I'm here.
- Why are you here?

37:48.256 --> 37:51.291
Why do you care what I think
about Auggie?

37:51.309 --> 37:53.343
Because he cares about you.

37:53.394 --> 37:55.763
And I care about him.

37:55.797 --> 37:58.766
So don't punish him
for something he didn't do.

38:10.812 --> 38:12.196
Welcome home.

38:12.247 --> 38:14.865
Oh, you two are a sight
for sore eyes.

38:18.086 --> 38:19.119
Hi, buddy boy.

38:19.153 --> 38:21.288
Sounds like
you had quite a trip.

38:21.322 --> 38:24.091
Yeah, you could say that.

38:24.125 --> 38:26.176
What happened?

38:26.211 --> 38:30.631
Well, all things considered,
it went well.

38:36.437 --> 38:38.388
Hi, this is the voice mail
of Auggie Anderson.

38:38.439 --> 38:40.224
Please leave a message.

38:40.275 --> 38:43.477
Hey, Auggie. We left things
unresolved in Paris,

38:43.511 --> 38:45.112
and that's not like us.

38:45.146 --> 38:47.564
So I'm across town getting
your favorite coffee

38:47.615 --> 38:50.033
and doing it up
just the way you like it.

38:50.068 --> 38:53.320
Let's talk when I get in.
See you soon.

39:33.995 --> 39:36.396
Good morning, Annie.
Shall we get started?

39:36.414 --> 39:38.231
- Without Auggie?
- He's not coming in today.

39:38.249 --> 39:42.002
Apparently he caught
a bug on the flight.

39:42.036 --> 39:43.921
Great work in Paris.

39:43.955 --> 39:45.505
Everyone upstairs
is very impressed.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.124
Auggie deserves
all the credit.

39:47.175 --> 39:50.510
Spoken
like a seasoned handler.

39:50.545 --> 39:52.679
The mission
would not have been a success

39:52.714 --> 39:55.883
if it wasn't for the connection
he cultivated with Natasha.

39:55.917 --> 39:58.685
Now you sound like Auggie
when he talks about you.

39:58.720 --> 40:02.472
You two will always be
a great team.

40:04.309 --> 40:06.643
We've analyzed
the bank's data.

40:06.694 --> 40:09.029
Whose account
paid for Chicago?

40:09.063 --> 40:10.614
Ivan Kravec's.

40:24.829 --> 40:27.130
Now's not
a good time, Walker!

40:27.165 --> 40:29.666
Hurry up and open
the door, Auggie.

40:33.838 --> 40:36.139
Surprise!

40:36.174 --> 40:38.642
Come in.

40:38.676 --> 40:40.761
Surprise is right.

40:40.795 --> 40:42.512
I did not see this coming.

40:42.563 --> 40:45.015
That's because you're blind.

40:45.066 --> 40:47.901
How did you--
why the change of heart?

40:47.936 --> 40:50.520
Maybe I wanted
a happy ending.

40:56.978 --> 41:00.614
Incoming call--Hayley.

41:00.648 --> 41:03.116
- Work again?
- Incoming call--Hayley.

41:03.150 --> 41:05.118
Yeah.

41:05.152 --> 41:09.089
- Work can wait.
- Incoming call--Hayley.

41:09.123 --> 41:11.708
Incoming call--Hayley.
