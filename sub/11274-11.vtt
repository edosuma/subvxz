WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:05.088
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:05.088 --> 00:08.058
I'll tell you, Woody,
the psychiatric profession

00:08.058 --> 00:10.427
can really get rough sometimes.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.229
I think if I hear one
more person telling me

00:13.229 --> 00:14.731
about one more problem, I'll explode.

00:14.731 --> 00:17.100
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.351
Actually, I suppose you do.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.353
Our professions are
really very much alike.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.355
We both have to listen patiently

00:22.355 --> 00:24.824
while people unload
their grief and suffering.

00:24.824 --> 00:27.327
Sometimes it's just
more than I can bear.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.245
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

00:29.245 --> 00:31.698
You know, if only I had
your ability to listen

00:31.698 --> 00:34.200
to a person's problem,
sympathize with them,

00:34.200 --> 00:37.203
and yet still go on about my
business calmly and happily.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.089
How do you do it, Wood?

00:39.089 --> 00:41.424
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.762
You're not listening to me, are you?

00:45.762 --> 00:47.964
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.133
How about a double scotch rocks?

00:50.133 --> 00:50.884
Coming right up.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.806
(piano plays)

00:56.806 --> 00:59.692
? Making your way in the world today ?

00:59.692 --> 01:02.695
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:02.695 --> 01:05.197
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:05.197 --> 01:08.701
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:08.701 --> 01:13.957
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:13.957 --> 01:16.743
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:16.743 --> 01:21.748
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:21.748 --> 01:26.753
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:26.753 --> 01:29.255
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:29.255 --> 01:31.758
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:31.758 --> 01:37.263
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:37.263 --> 01:39.766
? You want to go where people know ?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.768
? People are all the same ?

01:42.268 --> 01:46.272
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:04.057 --> 02:06.392
All right, here, here it is, troops.

02:06.392 --> 02:08.761
The reason I called
you in was to tell you

02:08.761 --> 02:11.097
I just got a chance
to go up to Moose River

02:11.598 --> 02:13.483
to do some fishing with
some old baseball buddies.

02:13.483 --> 02:15.435
Ah, a fishing trip.

02:15.435 --> 02:16.769
Another desperate

02:16.769 --> 02:19.105
yet futile attempt to forget me.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.491
No, no, just another desperate

02:21.491 --> 02:23.860
yet futile attempt to catch some fish.

02:23.860 --> 02:25.528
The problem is

02:25.528 --> 02:26.863
I want to leave right now.

02:26.863 --> 02:28.364
So, who wants to be saddled

02:28.364 --> 02:30.250
with taking charge of
the place while I'm gone?

02:30.250 --> 02:31.584
Oh, me, me! I do!

02:31.584 --> 02:32.585
I want to!

02:32.585 --> 02:33.586
Uh, wait a minute here.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.588
Uh, all right, sit down, sit down.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.090
I guess I'm gonna have to make

02:37.090 --> 02:38.091
an executive decision here.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.593
All right,

02:40.593 --> 02:41.845
hold out your fists.

02:41.845 --> 02:43.096
There you go.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.597
One potato, two potato,
three potato, four...

02:44.597 --> 02:46.099
Oh, Sam, Sam, Sam.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.101
This isn't fair.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.435
It isn't?

02:49.435 --> 02:51.271
No-- everybody knows
that when you do

02:51.271 --> 02:53.273
"one potato, two potato"
with three people,

02:53.273 --> 02:57.277
you end up with the same
person with whom you started.

03:00.730 --> 03:03.116
Oh, yeah, all right. Uh...

03:03.116 --> 03:05.034
Oh, I got something else here.

03:05.034 --> 03:06.035
All right, all right.

03:06.035 --> 03:07.537
My dog died last night.

03:07.537 --> 03:09.789
What color is his blood?

03:09.789 --> 03:15.962
What kind of disgusting game is that?

03:15.962 --> 03:18.915
It's something I
played when I was a kid.

03:18.915 --> 03:19.799
Now pick a color.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.000
What for?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.335
Your dog's blood.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.722
Oh, this is horrible.

03:26.222 --> 03:28.591
You played this as a child?

03:28.591 --> 03:30.894
Well, no wonder you're so disturbed.

03:30.894 --> 03:32.896
Would you please pick a color

03:32.896 --> 03:35.265
so I can spell it and
knock somebody out?

03:35.265 --> 03:36.733
All right, mauve.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.823
All right, all right, um...

03:45.325 --> 03:46.776
Here we go, yeah.

03:46.776 --> 03:47.777
We'll use a bat here.

03:47.777 --> 03:48.778
Good idea.

03:48.778 --> 03:51.164
Okay, I'm in charge!

03:51.164 --> 03:52.615
Sam.

03:52.615 --> 03:54.617
Actually, I, uh, had this is mind.

03:54.617 --> 03:56.619
Woody, you know how to do this.

03:56.619 --> 03:57.620
Here you go.

03:57.620 --> 03:58.621
All right, here.

03:59.122 --> 04:00.006
Oh, oh...

04:00.924 --> 04:02.425
(laughing)

04:02.425 --> 04:03.426
Oh!

04:03.426 --> 04:05.428
He grabbed the little
knobby thing at the top.

04:05.428 --> 04:06.429
You can't do that.

04:06.429 --> 04:07.797
That's not part of the bat.

04:07.797 --> 04:10.433
WOODY: The little knobby
thing is so a part of the bat.

04:10.433 --> 04:11.351
Well, can he grab it?

04:11.351 --> 04:12.852
Sure he can grab it. ! Yeah.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.854
And then you and I get three turns

04:14.854 --> 04:16.356
trying to kick it out of his fingers

04:16.356 --> 04:18.224
and the one who kicks it out wins.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.692
Well, how do we decide who kicks first?

04:20.692 --> 04:22.195
One potato, two potato...

04:22.195 --> 04:23.696
Oh!

04:23.696 --> 04:25.698
You're going to have to make a decision

04:25.698 --> 04:28.701
like a rational adult human being.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.203
All right, all right.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.205
Okay, Woody's my man.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.206
Oh! Oh, no!

04:33.206 --> 04:35.458
Come on! Why Woody?

04:35.458 --> 04:36.793
Well, because he's the only person

04:36.793 --> 04:38.795
who hasn't irritated the hell out of me

04:38.795 --> 04:40.163
in the last five minutes.

04:40.163 --> 04:41.547
Come on. Get out of here.

04:42.048 --> 04:44.550
Let me, uh, go over some of
the management rules with him.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.551
Go on, go on.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.842
I think you're really gonna
enjoy this weekend, boss.

04:54.844 --> 04:57.230
Okay,
first rule--

04:57.230 --> 04:59.766
keep this with you at all times.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.158
Oh, Woody, here's a letter from Indiana.

05:09.158 --> 05:10.493
Oh, boy!

05:10.493 --> 05:12.996
It's from my girlfriend, Beth.

05:12.996 --> 05:14.914
So how are things in the
great Midwest, huh, Woods?

05:14.914 --> 05:17.750
Well, let's everybody gather
'round and we'll find out, huh?

05:17.750 --> 05:20.086
Oh, great, let's pull up the stove,

05:20.086 --> 05:23.089
whittle a tetch and chaw some tabacky.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.510
Boy, Beth writes the
greatest letters in the world.

05:27.510 --> 05:30.013
I can't wait for you guys to hear this.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.433
"Dear Woody,

05:33.433 --> 05:35.435
"this is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.938
"What I have to say is that
I care about you very much,

05:38.938 --> 05:41.441
"but I'm afraid we can't
stay together anymore.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.943
"You see, I've fallen in
love with Leonard Twilley

05:43.943 --> 05:45.445
"and we're flying up to Niagara Falls

05:45.445 --> 05:46.946
"on the 20th to be married.

05:46.946 --> 05:49.449
"We're gonna drop by
and see you on our way.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.317
"I feel I have to explain in person.

05:51.317 --> 05:52.702
"I hope you understand

05:52.702 --> 05:54.704
"and find it in your
heart to forgive me.

05:54.704 --> 05:57.707
See you Saturday. Love, Beth."

05:59.208 --> 06:03.212
Well, this isn't quite as
good as her usual letters.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.752
I'm so sorry, Woody.

06:09.752 --> 06:11.254
I can't believe it.

06:11.254 --> 06:13.256
Beth and Leonard Twilley.

06:13.256 --> 06:15.258
Woody, today's Saturday, you know.

06:15.258 --> 06:16.759
Uh, she could be here any minute.

06:16.759 --> 06:20.146
Gosh, I'm feeling kind of bad.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.647
Listen, if you'll excuse me,

06:21.647 --> 06:23.649
I think I'd like to be alone now.

06:29.072 --> 06:31.074
Oh, I guess it'd be easier if I left.

06:31.074 --> 06:34.494
Uh, wait a sec, Wood.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.863
You know, maybe this is really

06:37.363 --> 06:38.364
a blessing in disguise.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.367
You see, sometimes in
order to achieve maturity,

06:41.367 --> 06:44.370
it's necessary to disengage
oneself from relationships

06:44.370 --> 06:46.372
that keep one's growth rooted

06:46.372 --> 06:49.375
in an artificially
prolonged period of stasis.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.877
I know just how you feel, Dr. Crane.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.264
Woody, come on.

06:55.264 --> 06:57.517
Sometimes things work out
for the best, you know?

06:57.517 --> 06:58.801
Look at it this way.

06:58.801 --> 07:00.803
Boston's crawling with
beautiful, single women.

07:00.803 --> 07:02.305
Just get on out there.

07:02.305 --> 07:03.689
CLIFF: Yeah, he's right, you know.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.691
Take it from one who knows.

07:05.691 --> 07:09.061
Yeah, but since Sammy's not
here, just take it from us.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.564
CLIFF: Yeah, you know, he
is, uh, right there, Woody.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.399
You know, the best way
to forget about Beth

07:13.399 --> 07:14.901
is go out there, find some skirt,

07:14.901 --> 07:18.871
have her, use her and throw her away.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.373
Maybe you guys are right.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.875
Maybe the best way to get over this

07:22.875 --> 07:26.379
is to make wild, crazy, passionate love

07:26.379 --> 07:29.382
to the first available
woman who comes along.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.884
Woody, don't listen to them.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.387
It's not necessary for you to suppress

07:34.387 --> 07:36.389
your grief in debauchery.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.392
It's important for you to experience it.

07:39.392 --> 07:42.895
People grow from intense suffering.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.263
Yeah? Then how come

07:44.263 --> 07:46.766
I haven't grown an inch
since I've known you?

07:52.655 --> 07:55.908
Oh, boy, Normie, look at this.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.411
Another psychic's head exploded.

08:01.914 --> 08:04.417
Kind of makes you wonder why anyone

08:04.417 --> 08:07.420
goes into that line of work, doesn't it?

08:07.420 --> 08:09.422
Excuse me.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.924
I've been experiencing
grief all afternoon

08:11.924 --> 08:13.426
and instead of killing myself,

08:13.426 --> 08:15.428
I'd like to take you out to dinner.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.930
Sounds great, but no thank you.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.433
Did I say it was my treat?

08:23.936 --> 08:26.439
Woody, you've hit on nearly
every woman in the bar.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.940
Why are you so persistent?

08:27.940 --> 08:29.942
Well, when Beth gets here, you know,

08:29.942 --> 08:32.445
I want to show her that
I got someone else, too.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.946
If there's one thing I can't stand,

08:33.946 --> 08:35.948
it's that look of pity in her eyes.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.950
I'm sure she's far too wrapped up

08:38.451 --> 08:41.453
in her own happiness to
have time to pity you.

08:43.371 --> 08:45.208
Well, that is a comfort.

08:46.909 --> 08:49.829
Hi, Woody.

08:49.829 --> 08:50.830
Oh, hi, Beth.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.832
Hi, Leonard.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.217
Did you get my letter?

08:54.217 --> 08:55.968
Yeah, I got it.

08:55.968 --> 08:56.836
Are you mad?

08:56.836 --> 08:58.804
Oh, no, I'm not mad at all.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.806
You know, you're the
last person in the world

09:00.806 --> 09:02.308
I ever wanted to hurt.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.809
Hey, I'm fine, really.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.811
Can I get you guys something to drink?

09:05.811 --> 09:06.812
Wine.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.314
How 'bout a brewski?

09:08.314 --> 09:09.315
Brewski...

09:12.318 --> 09:15.321
Woody, we didn't mean
for this to happen.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.823
It was fate.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.825
I was in Fryer's Hardware Store

09:19.825 --> 09:21.827
looking at some copper tubing.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.830
Beth was buying a lawn
sprinkler and, well...

09:24.830 --> 09:27.333
I never stood a chance.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.453
Oh, Leonard, I can't stand it.

09:30.453 --> 09:31.954
Look what we've done to him.

09:31.954 --> 09:34.457
I know, it's worse than
I thought it would be.

09:34.457 --> 09:35.458
Oh, please, guys, don't do that.

09:35.458 --> 09:37.460
How can we happily walk down the aisle

09:37.460 --> 09:38.461
knowing we're leaving
him here like this?

09:38.961 --> 09:40.463
I won't be in the mood for any cake.

09:40.463 --> 09:41.464
Beth... Leonard...

09:41.464 --> 09:42.965
I keep getting

09:42.965 --> 09:44.467
this picture of you sitting alone

09:44.467 --> 09:45.968
in your room, night after night,

09:45.968 --> 09:47.970
and it makes me want to cry.

09:47.970 --> 09:48.854
DIANE: Hi, Beth.

09:48.854 --> 09:50.523
Nice to meet you, Leonard.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.859
Woody, uh, don't you think it's time

09:53.859 --> 09:55.361
to tell Beth
about you-know-who?

09:55.361 --> 09:56.862
Who?

09:56.862 --> 09:59.365
Well, that lovely young lady

09:59.365 --> 10:01.233
you've been seeing so much of.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.201
Is this true?

10:02.201 --> 10:03.119
Yes.

10:04.620 --> 10:07.039
Well, I'm glad you found someone, Woody.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.541
What's she like?

10:08.541 --> 10:11.043
Well, uh, uh, she's about four, five,

10:11.043 --> 10:12.044
five, five feet

10:12.044 --> 10:13.546
four or five.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.047
She's kind of hard to describe.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.552
Cornflower blue eyes,

10:19.552 --> 10:22.054
titian hair, Raphaelesque figure.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.424
And she smells good.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.093
I feel so much better

10:27.093 --> 10:29.312
knowing you won't be alone.

10:29.312 --> 10:31.147
Well...

10:31.147 --> 10:33.566
Come on, Leonard. We'd better be going.

10:35.985 --> 10:37.853
It was nice seeing you, Woody.

10:37.853 --> 10:40.189
Bye, Beth.

10:40.189 --> 10:41.607
Good luck.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.859
Yeah, good luck, Beth.

10:43.859 --> 10:46.662
DIANE: Well, it's too
bad you two had to leave.

10:46.662 --> 10:48.030
I know you would have

10:48.030 --> 10:49.031
enjoyed meeting Woody's girlfriend.

10:49.031 --> 10:50.032
She's extraordinary.

10:50.032 --> 10:51.534
Yeah, we could have had dinner tonight.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.919
Actually our plane doesn't
leave till midnight.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.421
Oh, that's right.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.923
Well, we can all have dinner together.

10:57.923 --> 10:59.342
Oh, great.

10:59.342 --> 11:00.343
8:00 okay?

11:00.343 --> 11:01.711
Yeah, fine.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.133
Way to go, Miss Chambers.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.634
What am I gonna do now?

11:08.634 --> 11:09.635
I'm sorry, Woody.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.137
I have a strict rule

11:11.137 --> 11:14.140
about meddling in
other people's affairs.

11:22.548 --> 11:26.268
Why did Miss Chambers have to
shoot my big mouth off for me?

11:28.220 --> 11:30.723
Boy, this is the worst thing
that's ever happened to anybody.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.641
Oh, I don't know about that, Woody.

11:32.641 --> 11:35.644
Uh, did you ever have your head explode?

11:37.029 --> 11:39.899
Woody, as a way of apologizing,

11:39.899 --> 11:41.400
let me try to think

11:41.400 --> 11:43.402
of another way out of this.

11:43.402 --> 11:44.403
Now, let's see.

11:44.403 --> 11:47.790
I'm sure we can think of something.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.577
Well, it better be good,
'cause I need a date quick.

11:51.577 --> 11:55.081
Oh, boy, it's too bad
Sammy's not here to help ya.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.083
Hey, Sammy may not be here,

11:57.083 --> 11:59.585
but his inventory is.

11:59.585 --> 12:00.586
Yeah, Woody.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.587
Oh, hey, hey, hey...

12:01.587 --> 12:02.588
Woody,

12:02.588 --> 12:04.974
put that down on the bar very carefully

12:04.974 --> 12:05.975
and walk away.

12:08.344 --> 12:09.678
Yeah, it's a little bit too hot

12:09.678 --> 12:11.180
for you to handle there, Woodman.

12:11.180 --> 12:12.181
I'll tell ya what I'll do.

12:12.181 --> 12:14.433
I'll give you the number
of one of my tootsies.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.103
I think he'd prefer something

12:17.103 --> 12:18.104
that lives above ground.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.942
Wait a minute.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.777
Do you really think it's proper

12:24.777 --> 12:27.780
to be rifling through
a man's personal papers?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.783
No matter how close a
friend, no matter how...

12:30.783 --> 12:32.034
Miss Chambers, you're in here.

12:32.034 --> 12:34.370
Give me that.

12:34.370 --> 12:35.871
"Diane Chambers.

12:35.871 --> 12:38.374
"Probably the most
incredible woman I ever met.

12:38.374 --> 12:39.875
Don't you agree, Diane?"

12:39.875 --> 12:41.377
Well...

12:45.848 --> 12:46.849
Hey, here's one.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.850
Three stars.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.186
"Tina Wilson.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.138
Fun, sexy, easy."

12:52.138 --> 12:54.140
Well, she sounds interesting.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.142
And you know just what to do

12:56.142 --> 12:57.526
with sweet Tina Wilson.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.813
Have her, use her, and
I'll throw her away.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.616
I don't think you're
going to get an answer.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.067
Why not?

13:05.067 --> 13:07.820
I'm sweet Tina Wilson.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.708
Well, what would be a
good time to call you?

13:17.329 --> 13:18.714
Ah, it's not workin'.

13:18.714 --> 13:19.715
I'm no good at this.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.834
No, no, no, Woody.
Don't give up so easily.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.552
Oh, here's one.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.806
Oh, oh, look at this here,
the ultimate one, too, huh?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.808
She's got a whole page to herself.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.809
Yeah!

13:29.809 --> 13:30.759
"Desiree Harrison."

13:30.759 --> 13:32.761
Oh, look at all those stars.

13:32.761 --> 13:34.263
Yeah, any more stars

13:34.263 --> 13:36.265
you'd have to pledge allegiance to her.

13:36.265 --> 13:37.266
Yeah, hey.

13:37.766 --> 13:39.768
"The best, the best, the best."

13:39.768 --> 13:42.771
Hey, get on the horn there, Woods.

13:42.771 --> 13:45.274
Woody, something tells
me you shouldn't do this.

13:45.774 --> 13:46.775
Please reconsider.

13:46.775 --> 13:49.278
Oh, that's easy for you to
say. You got him into this.

13:49.278 --> 13:51.280
Why don't you do something
extraordinary for once

13:51.280 --> 13:52.164
and butt out?

13:56.418 --> 13:57.586
What do I say to her?

13:57.586 --> 14:00.422
Uh, tell her you're a
friend of Sam Malone.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.675
Good.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.961
Hi, uh, De, Desiree?

14:05.961 --> 14:07.346
Yeah, I'm a friend of Sam Malone.

14:08.714 --> 14:11.100
Hold on. She wants to know why I called.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.352
Tell her that, uh, Sammy
said she was the best.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.221
And you want to find out for yourself.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.190
Oh, good. Uh, yeah,
Sam says you're the best

14:18.190 --> 14:20.693
and I wanna find out for myself.

14:21.193 --> 14:21.694
Hold on.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.062
She wants to know my name.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.530
Wing it.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.533
Yeah, it's Woody Boyd.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.035
Yeah, how about 7:00 tonight?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.287
Yeah?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.621
Okay, uh, well,

14:32.621 --> 14:35.624
I'll see ya here in the bar.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.625
Great. Ha-ha!

14:36.625 --> 14:37.626
All right, Woody!

14:37.626 --> 14:42.498
Well, seein' as how
it's Gomer's night out...

14:44.133 --> 14:46.585
...that leaves me in charge of the bar.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.054
Oh, not necessarily.

14:49.054 --> 14:53.392
Woody, who do you assign
to take command of the bar?

14:53.392 --> 14:56.645
Well, I don't know how to
choose between the two of you.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.931
Oh, I know, I know.
We're both your friends.

14:58.931 --> 14:59.932
No, it's not that.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.433
You ruined "one potato, two potato."

15:02.935 --> 15:05.938
Okay, why don't we let the bar decide?

15:05.938 --> 15:07.356
Well, that seems

15:07.356 --> 15:09.325
the fair and democratic thing to do.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.776
(clanking fork)

15:10.776 --> 15:15.281
We should each make a speech
presenting our best arguments

15:15.281 --> 15:17.783
as to why we should
be in charge of the bar

15:17.783 --> 15:19.285
and we'll leave it up to you.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.287
Carla, the floor is yours,

15:21.287 --> 15:23.789
and not for the first time, I might add.

15:28.794 --> 15:33.299
If I'm elected, no way
will Diane make a speech.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.684
(cheering)

15:39.555 --> 15:40.556
Whoo! Whoo!

15:45.561 --> 15:46.946
(patrons whistling)

15:46.946 --> 15:49.281
Hey, hubba-hubba!

15:49.281 --> 15:50.950
How do I look? Is my tie crooked?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.118
Uh, no, but your pants are on backwards.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.823
Made ya look. Made ya look.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.124
That's very funny, Mr. Clavin,

15:59.124 --> 16:01.627
but I guess I'm not in the
mood for that clever humor.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.630
Yeah, you and the rest of creation.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.583
Yeah, I'm worried about
my date with, uh, Desiree.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.084
She's one of Sam's women.

16:09.084 --> 16:11.470
She may be too much for one man.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.976
Is there somebody here named Woody?

16:16.976 --> 16:17.810
Yeah.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.311
I'm Desiree.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.681
Uh, just a minute, please.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.768
Is it me or does she look different

16:25.768 --> 16:27.152
than she did on the phone?

16:27.936 --> 16:29.905
She comes highly
recommended by the master.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.407
All right, here goes nothin'.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.827
So you're Desiree?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.694
Yeah.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.579
Hi, I'm Woody.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.581
Can I get your coat?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.118
What's she doin' here?

16:43.118 --> 16:45.120
That's Woody's date.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.623
Woody's goin' out with
Sam's cleaning lady?

16:50.626 --> 16:51.627
Cleaning lady?

16:51.627 --> 16:54.630
That's right. Sam says she's the best.

16:57.132 --> 16:59.134
So how are you?

16:59.134 --> 17:00.135
Fine. Shall we get started?

17:00.135 --> 17:01.637
What? Right, right here?

17:01.637 --> 17:04.306
Here or in the back if you prefer.

17:04.306 --> 17:06.642
Well, don't you want any dinner first?

17:06.642 --> 17:08.143
No, I'd like to get right to it.

17:08.143 --> 17:10.529
I'll stop to eat when
I get a little tired.

17:10.529 --> 17:11.814
Wow.

17:11.814 --> 17:14.199
I figure you probably
have your own equipment.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.201
If not, I have mine out in the car.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.704
What sort of equipment?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.705
Well, the first thing
we'll need is a bucket.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.707
Really?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.709
Yeah, and some rubber gloves

17:23.709 --> 17:25.711
and one of those really hard
brushes with a long handle.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.466
You've gotta be kiddin' me.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.802
Well, I need something to get
to those hard-to-reach places.

17:33.802 --> 17:37.806
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

17:37.806 --> 17:42.511
Guys, I think there's things
about Sam that we don't know.

17:42.511 --> 17:44.012
No, no, Woody, she's not Sam's date.

17:44.513 --> 17:45.514
She's his maid.

17:45.514 --> 17:46.515
Yeah, Carla told us.

17:46.515 --> 17:47.516
Those stars mean

17:47.516 --> 17:49.518
she's the best housekeeper around.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.023
Oh, boy, do I feel stupid!

17:55.023 --> 17:56.525
What am I gonna do now?

17:56.525 --> 17:59.278
Maybe you should, uh,
tell her the truth.

18:01.697 --> 18:02.397
Yeah, yeah, okay.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.202
Uh, listen, ma'am,

18:07.202 --> 18:09.204
I think there's been a terrible mistake.

18:09.204 --> 18:10.706
I don't think I'm gonna be...

18:10.706 --> 18:12.091
Hi, Woody.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.761
So that's what you call titian hair.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.879
Hi,

18:16.879 --> 18:18.097
I'm Beth.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.264
I'm Desiree.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.100
This is my fiancé, Leonard.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.384
Good.

18:25.888 --> 18:29.391
Yeah, they're gonna be joining us

18:29.391 --> 18:30.893
for dinner tonight.

18:30.893 --> 18:32.394
Dinner?

18:32.394 --> 18:35.397
You wanna take me out to dinner?

18:35.397 --> 18:36.899
Yeah. So what do you say?

18:36.899 --> 18:40.152
Well, it beats scrubbin'
grout with a toothbrush.

18:40.152 --> 18:44.490
You folks and your
big-city expressions.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.992
Yes, I thought we'd eat at Melville's,

18:46.992 --> 18:48.877
if that's okay with you, ma'am.

18:48.877 --> 18:49.745
Okay.

18:52.748 --> 18:56.135
I was expecting someone
a little younger, Woody.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.136
Me, too.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.393
That was fun.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.894
Nice seein' ya.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.396
Listen, have a nice marriage.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.398
Well, didn't somebody mention dancing?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.899
We still have time
before our plane leaves.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.901
Now you want to take me dancing?

19:12.901 --> 19:15.270
It sure beats scrubbin'
grout with a toothbrush.

19:15.270 --> 19:18.190
Hey, I could live here.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.691
Let me go freshen up.

19:19.691 --> 19:23.695
Oh, dancing. I hope my knees hold out.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.082
Is it any wonder I love her?

19:27.082 --> 19:28.450
I like her, Woody.

19:28.450 --> 19:30.452
Yeah, listen, why don't
you two have a seat?

19:30.452 --> 19:31.954
I'll get you somethin' to drink.

19:39.461 --> 19:41.964
Woody...

19:41.964 --> 19:43.966
I know I got you into this,

19:43.966 --> 19:45.968
but it's time to stop.

19:45.968 --> 19:47.469
I know Beth hurt you,

19:47.469 --> 19:49.972
but she doesn't deserve to be lied to.

19:49.972 --> 19:52.474
Besides, would your
mother be proud of you

19:52.975 --> 19:54.977
if she knew what you were doing?

19:56.478 --> 19:58.981
Let Beth know how you feel.

19:58.981 --> 20:01.483
I think it would do you both good.

20:01.483 --> 20:04.486
You're right, Miss Chambers.

20:04.486 --> 20:06.488
I guess I owe Beth that much.

20:10.042 --> 20:15.047
Oh, you won't tell my mother, will you?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.548
Mum's the word.

20:16.548 --> 20:20.052
You won't tell my mum, will you?

20:29.895 --> 20:31.396
Excuse me, uh, Beth, can I talk

20:31.396 --> 20:32.397
to you for a moment?

20:32.397 --> 20:34.399
Sure, Woody. Excuse us, Leonard.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.903
Sure. You're not gonna steal her

20:37.903 --> 20:39.404
back from me, are you, Woody?

20:39.404 --> 20:40.906
Go drink your beer, Leonard.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.908
Yes, dear.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.914
Uh, listen, Beth.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.920
Desiree's not my girlfriend.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.290
Well, I had a feeling.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.676
What gave it away?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.544
When she forgot your name during dinner.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.964
See, I was so hurt,

21:05.964 --> 21:07.716
I, I didn't want you to
think that I was on my own.

21:07.716 --> 21:09.434
I'm sorry.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.220
But you know we couldn't have lasted.

21:12.220 --> 21:13.722
We've grown apart.

21:13.722 --> 21:16.108
We're just too different now.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.610
You're the adventurous type.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.112
I just want to settle down.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.481
I love you, Beth.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.784
I love you, too, Woody.

21:25.784 --> 21:29.655
Leonard's more a part of my world.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.657
Well, maybe I could
move back to Indiana.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.575
Do you want to do that?

21:33.575 --> 21:35.577
No.

21:35.577 --> 21:38.580
And I could never live in Boston, so...

21:38.580 --> 21:41.466
how does that leave us?

21:41.466 --> 21:44.086
Real sad.

21:44.086 --> 21:45.804
Yeah.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.639
Well, I hope you get happy.

21:47.639 --> 21:51.560
There's, uh, something
I want to give you.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.561
Oh, no, it's okay.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.062
The drinks are on me.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.063
No. (chuckles)

21:55.063 --> 21:56.565
I meant this.

22:00.936 --> 22:02.437
Good-bye, Woody.

22:03.689 --> 22:08.026
That, Leonard, is, uh,
how the tractor was born.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.833
Come on, Leonard. We
have a plane to catch.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.286
Okay. Well, good-bye.

22:18.286 --> 22:20.288
You guys ever find
yourselves in Indiana,

22:20.288 --> 22:21.289
you know what to do.

22:21.289 --> 22:25.043
Yeah, run screamin' to the airport.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.764
See ya, Woody.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.098
Bye, Leonard.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.099
You take care of her.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.351
I will.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.136
You better.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.527
Are you okay, Woody?

22:45.030 --> 22:47.532
Well, I feel pretty bad.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.534
It hurts, but at least it's settled.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.037
Now I can go back to
bein' Woody Boyd again.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.038
Oh, hey, Woody Boyd,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.540
what about Mrs. Clean in the back there?

22:57.542 --> 22:58.410
Come on, you guys.

22:58.410 --> 22:59.161
Take it easy.

22:59.161 --> 23:01.163
She happens to be a very nice lady.

23:01.163 --> 23:03.048
We had a good time tonight.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.417
She talked about all kinds
of interesting things:

23:05.417 --> 23:06.802
movies, sports...

23:06.802 --> 23:08.086
How to get cat hair out of the drapes.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.588
(all laugh)

23:13.258 --> 23:15.761
Good-bye, Woody.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.263
Uh, no, Desiree, please, don't go.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.765
I'm not stupid.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.768
Don't pay any attention to them.

23:22.768 --> 23:26.271
Look, I'm not exactly sure
what happened here tonight.

23:26.271 --> 23:27.272
Something tells me

23:27.272 --> 23:28.774
you got trapped into this.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.275
So I'm gonna let you off the hook.

23:30.275 --> 23:31.276
Now, look,

23:31.276 --> 23:33.278
when, when I talked
to you earlier today,

23:33.278 --> 23:35.280
I admit I thought you
were somebody else.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.782
But I had fun tonight.

23:36.782 --> 23:37.783
I like you.

23:37.783 --> 23:42.170
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is

23:42.170 --> 23:45.457
I need somebody to talk to.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.343
What'd you have in mind?

23:48.343 --> 23:49.294
I don't know.

23:49.294 --> 23:52.547
I, uh, thought maybe a cup of coffee.

23:54.382 --> 23:55.383
Sure. Why not?

23:56.351 --> 23:57.853
This isn't gonna turn

23:57.853 --> 24:01.356
into one of those
May/December romances, is it?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.858
Well, with the holidays comin' up,

24:02.858 --> 24:05.227
December's no good, but May's okay.
