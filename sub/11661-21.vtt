00:40.934 --> 00:45.066
(serene music playing)

01:05.533 --> 01:06.867
Oh, Ma, come here.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.567
I want you to taste this.

01:17.567 --> 01:18.734
Well?

01:18.800 --> 01:22.934
Wouldn't it be easier to put
a pillow over my face while I sleep?

01:26.133 --> 01:27.734
Just set the table.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.967
I'm expecting Stan
and his cousin any minute.

01:30.033 --> 01:33.533
Oh, then this sauce is perfect.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.367
Well, maybe just a drop
more disinfectant.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.767
There. I'm done.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.367
Sure took you a long time
to spell "Welcome, Magda."

01:44.433 --> 01:46.367
I thought that'd be too boring.

01:46.433 --> 01:51.233
Instead, I decided to depict Magda's
escape from Czechoslovakia.

01:54.266 --> 01:56.233
But isn't that barbed wire?

01:58.567 --> 02:00.967
Isn't it amazing
what you can do with icing?

02:01.033 --> 02:05.166
Gee, you made that pack of dogs
look very realistic.

02:05.233 --> 02:08.867
But, Rose, the revolution in
Czechoslovakia was a peaceful one.

02:08.934 --> 02:11.300
Nobody was chased
by a pack of dogs.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.367
But they're good dogs,
Rose.

02:17.734 --> 02:19.367
You are not going
to believe this.

02:19.433 --> 02:22.000
My sister Charmaine just called me.

02:22.066 --> 02:24.867
I didn't think
you two were speaking.

02:24.934 --> 02:26.266
Well, we're not.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.867
How did you know
it was her on the line?

02:29.934 --> 02:34.100
Rose, you're bringing down
the curve for the whole country.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.600
I don't believe it.

02:36.667 --> 02:40.700
She's coming to promote
a novel she's had published.

02:40.767 --> 02:43.600
We're all invited
to a book-signing party.

02:43.667 --> 02:47.066
I can't believe she read a book,
much less wrote one.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.266
-(doorbell chimes)
-They're here.

02:49.333 --> 02:52.433
I just hope Magda
is nothing like Stan.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.066
What'll I do about my sister?

02:56.133 --> 02:59.367
When she leaves Miami, she'll be
more famous here than I am.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.767
Honey, only if they
close the Sheraton.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.333
-Dorothy?
-Cousin Magda.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.533
Such a beautiful home.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.500
Who sleeps with
government official?

03:16.266 --> 03:19.066
That would be
my friend Blanche.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.100
-Pleased to meet you, Magda.
-Thank you.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.900
This is my mother Sophia Petrillo.

03:25.967 --> 03:27.667
So, you're Stan's cousin.

03:27.734 --> 03:30.333
Please don't hold it against me.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.467
She's ok.

03:32.533 --> 03:33.533
Please, sit down, sit down.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.834
Say, where's Stan,
parking the car?

03:35.900 --> 03:38.400
I take taxi. We have disagreement.

03:38.467 --> 03:40.000
Oh, what about?

03:40.066 --> 03:43.433
He saw himself as human being,
I disagreed.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.900
The man is pig.

03:44.967 --> 03:47.533
He charge me rent,
his own cousin.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.934
I can believe that.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.200
His rates are reasonable,

03:50.266 --> 03:54.233
but he nickels
and dimes you on the extras.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.133
No, you're right.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.433
Stan is a lazy, disgusting,
sorry excuse for a man.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.166
I stay here with you.

04:01.233 --> 04:04.567
On the other hand,
I hear he just got cable.

04:05.066 --> 04:07.000
But I have nowhere to go.

04:07.066 --> 04:09.567
I'm stranger in strange land.

04:09.633 --> 04:12.000
Don't send me to cheap motel.

04:12.066 --> 04:15.667
You have to pay for ice,
just like at Stanley's.

04:17.066 --> 04:19.000
Would it be ok
if she stayed with us?

04:19.066 --> 04:22.600
A novel!
How did my sister publish a novel?

04:22.667 --> 04:25.700
I think it's ok if you stay here.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.967
You take my room.
I'll sleep with Ma.

04:28.033 --> 04:32.533
At least now when I wake up
screaming, I'll have a reason.

04:34.266 --> 04:39.066
(calm music playing)

04:42.233 --> 04:44.066
And you remember that time

04:44.133 --> 04:47.266
big daddy caught us skinny-dipping
with those boys?

04:47.333 --> 04:49.400
You said it was
our bible study group

04:49.467 --> 04:52.233
just practicing baptizing.

04:53.433 --> 04:56.467
It would've worked if you hadn't
come up screaming,

04:56.533 --> 04:59.767
"Hey, you all,
things look bigger underwater."

05:08.066 --> 05:11.166
Maybe it's my imagination,
but we seem to be getting along.

05:11.233 --> 05:12.834
I know.

05:12.900 --> 05:17.166
You just seem so refined
and vivacious and charming.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.166
Boy, you've really changed.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.100
Thank you, Blanche.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.567
Don't forget, I'll see you later
at the book signing.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.367
Maybe I can get your book there.

05:29.433 --> 05:33.400
-Well, it just so happens...
-Oh, is this it?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.734
<i>Vixen, story of a woman.</i>

05:35.800 --> 05:37.633
Ooh, catchy title.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.200
Want me to sign it?

05:39.266 --> 05:42.667
Oh, sure.

05:42.734 --> 05:46.200
Oh, imagine,
an autographed copy.

05:46.266 --> 05:48.600
Will this make it
harder to exchange?

05:52.934 --> 05:54.433
Just kidding.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.700
"To my sister Blanche.
You have inspired me

05:58.767 --> 06:02.200
more than you will ever know.
Charmaine."

06:02.266 --> 06:04.033
That is very sweet.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.133
We'll see each other
at the book-signing.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.133
I meant to ask you.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.834
Do you know what happened
to big daddy's pocket watch?

06:15.900 --> 06:18.633
Virginia says you took it
after the funeral.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.433
That pocket watch
meant so much to me.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.700
Big daddy promised it to me.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.500
In writing?

06:25.567 --> 06:26.834
It was in the will.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.400
Is this the same will where
he promised the summer house

06:29.467 --> 06:32.066
to Gopher from <i>Love Boat?</i>

06:33.166 --> 06:35.333
No, this is the sober will.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.800
All right,
you can have the watch.

06:37.867 --> 06:38.900
It's in my room.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.400
Not now. I'm late.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.300
Bring it to the book signing.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.467
Bye, darling.
See you then.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.133
Did Charmaine leave already?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.367
What am I going to do?

06:51.433 --> 06:53.900
After years of jealousy and malice,

06:53.967 --> 06:57.800
we can finally be friends,
but now I've got to read her book.

06:57.867 --> 07:02.500
If it's junk, I'll have to tell her,
and that'll just kill her.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.967
Look on the bright side.
It could be good.

07:06.033 --> 07:08.433
I was looking on the bright side.

07:11.166 --> 07:16.200
(mellow music playing)

07:16.700 --> 07:18.166
What a day.

07:18.233 --> 07:20.033
Why, what's the matter?
Where's Magda?

07:20.100 --> 07:22.700
You mean Flora the Red Menace?

07:23.900 --> 07:25.600
She's helping Rose unload the car.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.033
Is something wrong, Dorothy?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.934
I don't wanna talk about it.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.834
Magda is driving us crazy.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.533
All she does is complain about
how awful things are in America.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.934
Everywhere we went
something bothered her.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.133
We showed her the mall.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.934
She said we live in
a plastic society with no soul.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.333
This was after I bought her beef
sticks and spreadable cheese

07:45.400 --> 07:46.934
from Hickory farms.

07:50.900 --> 07:54.800
Rose, everywhere you look the rich
take advantage of the poor.

07:54.867 --> 07:58.533
How can you deny there
are inequities in this society?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.767
Well, sure, there are inequities,

08:00.834 --> 08:04.400
but at least we treat
everybody the same.

08:05.567 --> 08:08.667
There must be something about
this country you like.

08:08.734 --> 08:10.033
I like Slurpee's.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.967
That's your fifth one
in the last hour.

08:13.033 --> 08:17.000
They taste so natural and fruitlike.

08:17.066 --> 08:19.767
Oh, Blanche, I see you started
Charmaine's book. How is it?

08:19.834 --> 08:22.700
I don't know if I can finish it.

08:22.767 --> 08:27.066
-It's not good?
-This book's totally unbelievable.

08:27.133 --> 08:30.867
The heroine, Vixen St. James,
is this shallow southern belle

08:30.934 --> 08:32.934
who's vain, self-centered,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.033
and a pushover for any man
that crosses her path.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.467
She's right.
That is unbelievable.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.400
Oh! Oh!

08:44.467 --> 08:46.967
Oh! Oh.

08:47.033 --> 08:50.533
You drank the Slurpee too
fast again, didn't you?

08:50.600 --> 08:53.000
It's like knife
sticking in forehead.

08:53.066 --> 08:58.066
The pain! It is... really good.

08:59.233 --> 09:01.533
These Slurpee's are
best thing about America.

09:01.600 --> 09:06.266
How can you be such an expert?
You've only been here a few days.

09:06.333 --> 09:09.000
I know that communist system
is more fair.

09:09.066 --> 09:10.734
How can you say that?

09:10.800 --> 09:14.667
People all over the world are
realizing communism doesn't work.

09:14.734 --> 09:18.800
It worked for me.
I had automatic can opener.

09:18.867 --> 09:23.166
I was near top
of list to get electricity.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.633
For me things were good.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.734
If things were bad
for everyone else,

09:28.800 --> 09:31.300
how is that fair, comrade?

09:31.367 --> 09:34.967
Don't tell me about communism.
I know what I know.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.633
I'm a communist.

09:40.567 --> 09:44.000
This is terrible.
I was raised to hate communists.

09:44.066 --> 09:47.533
I remember the early fifties
when McCarthy came to St. Olaf

09:47.600 --> 09:50.367
to speak in the town square.

09:50.433 --> 09:53.633
I was never so moved
by a public speaker.

09:53.700 --> 09:57.834
Some people thought he was
a puppet for the right wing.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.233
No, wait. That was Charlie McCarthy.

10:04.467 --> 10:06.133
I'd have put
money on that.

10:07.467 --> 10:13.066
But still, St. Olaf's town motto
was "Better Ned than Red."

10:13.133 --> 10:15.600
Ned was sort of the town idiot.

10:18.066 --> 10:19.900
When, on your days off?

10:24.767 --> 10:27.233
Do you want me to throw her out?

10:27.300 --> 10:30.567
Yes. And while you're at it,
ditch the commie.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.000
I don't believe this.
I don't believe it!

10:36.066 --> 10:37.333
Blanche, what's the matter?

10:37.400 --> 10:38.867
Listen to this.

10:38.934 --> 10:41.000
"Vixen stared at herself
in the mirror.

10:41.066 --> 10:43.567
Her pouty lips,
her flaxen hair,

10:43.633 --> 10:46.000
her flawless
alabaster skin.

10:46.066 --> 10:48.000
Her proud breasts
seemed to be saying,

10:48.066 --> 10:50.967
'Is it just me,
or is it cold in here?'"

10:55.433 --> 10:56.467
So?

10:56.533 --> 10:59.000
Pouty, flaxen, proud.

10:59.066 --> 11:02.467
What do you need, a photograph?
This book is about me.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.033
(soft music playing)

11:17.400 --> 11:18.667
I don't see Blanche.

11:18.734 --> 11:21.200
She'll be over right
after her hair appointment.

11:21.266 --> 11:23.667
She wanted to look her best.

11:23.734 --> 11:26.967
Blanche is handling this
better than I would.

11:27.033 --> 11:31.633
I would kill Gloria if she ever
wrote about my sexual escapades.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.033
You'd kill your sister
over a pamphlet?

11:40.767 --> 11:44.467
-So many books.
-This is a bookstore.

11:44.533 --> 11:47.567
I'll be in the bitter children
of celebrities section.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.600
Don't get lost.

11:50.667 --> 11:51.400
Too many books.

11:51.467 --> 11:54.367
Too many contradictory opinions
next to each other.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.033
This leads to anarchy.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.033
These books represent
different ideas.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.333
What's going to happen
now there is freedom?

12:01.400 --> 12:05.000
People will read these books
and be confused.

12:05.066 --> 12:09.133
The ways things were,
we knew what to do.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.467
When there's one road,
no one gets lost.

12:11.533 --> 12:16.367
-Not necessarily. In St. Olaf--
-Rose.

12:16.433 --> 12:18.800
Is this a story about someone
getting lost?

12:18.867 --> 12:21.300
-Uh-huh.
-Don't tell us. Show us.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.900
There are two books
I want you to read.

12:27.967 --> 12:31.266
The first one is Thomas Paine's
<i>Common Sense.</i>

12:31.333 --> 12:34.900
It'll give you some idea
of what freedom is all about.

12:34.967 --> 12:37.867
The second is Vanna White's
autobiography.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.367
Why should I read this?

12:41.433 --> 12:43.567
It's a hell of a book.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.300
Ma.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.333
Ma, I don't how much more
of Magda I can stand.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.900
We're so close
to the Bermuda triangle

12:52.967 --> 12:55.967
it would a shame for
her not to see it.

12:56.467 --> 12:58.500
You know, you really
can't blame Magda.

12:58.567 --> 13:02.033
It's all this communist ideology
that's been pumped into her.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.300
I hate communism.

13:03.367 --> 13:07.000
Of course you hate communism, Ma,
because you were raised a fascist.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.600
Blanche, where
have you been?

13:11.667 --> 13:14.200
Blanche?

13:14.700 --> 13:18.133
Blanche!
Oh, you look just beautiful.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.300
Thank you for coming.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.900
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.033
Did you get a chance
to read the book?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.667
Every word.

13:25.734 --> 13:27.200
What did you think?

13:27.266 --> 13:29.533
I should have known
I couldn't trust you.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.600
All that "Let's be sisters"
stuff was bull.

13:32.667 --> 13:35.934
You had no right to use
my life for your book,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.400
to twist facts so that beautiful,
sacred love

13:39.467 --> 13:41.266
became so much tawdry trash.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.367
I earned that "A" in history.

13:47.066 --> 13:50.900
For the first time in my life,
I'm ashamed to be a Hollingsworth.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.600
<i>Vixen, story of a woman</i>

13:52.667 --> 13:56.600
is nothing but a vulgar collection
of perverse sexual acts

13:56.667 --> 13:59.233
that are sheer and utter filth!

14:11.533 --> 14:15.266
(serene music playing)

14:16.433 --> 14:18.533
(telephone rings)

14:21.133 --> 14:22.467
Hello.

14:22.533 --> 14:24.233
Oh, just a minute.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.567
Blanche, it's for you.
It's Charmaine again.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.000
Ok.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.400
Don't you think
you should talk to her?

14:40.467 --> 14:42.400
She's still your sister.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.000
My sister has turned
into a deceitful old woman

14:45.066 --> 14:47.567
whose only pleasure
is in hurting people.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.033
No offense, Sophia.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.433
None taken.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.300
Slut.

14:57.367 --> 15:00.633
What really gets me is
I was willing to be friends.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.600
Just as I start to
forgive and forget,

15:02.667 --> 15:05.467
Charmaine turns my life
into a best seller.

15:05.533 --> 15:09.834
You're not the only one
who had a problem with sisters.

15:09.900 --> 15:14.367
When I was a kid,
I had a doll named Mrs. Doolittle.

15:14.433 --> 15:15.834
Gloria wasn't supposed to--

15:15.900 --> 15:20.200
Do we have to listen to that damn
Mrs. Doolittle story again?

15:20.266 --> 15:22.333
So your sister broke your doll.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.867
It was 50 years ago.

15:23.934 --> 15:25.800
It was very traumatic.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.667
She was my favorite doll.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.934
I didn't talk to Gloria for months,
but eventually, Blanche,

15:35.033 --> 15:40.166
I realized sisters are harder
to replace than dolls.

15:40.233 --> 15:43.467
So we made up,
and I vowed right then and there

15:43.533 --> 15:47.867
never, ever to fight over something
so childish and silly again.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.467
My favorite!

15:52.800 --> 15:55.667
I have a sister story
you'll find interesting.

15:55.734 --> 16:00.166
She made it so the eyes
would never close again!

16:00.233 --> 16:03.533
She made Mrs. Doolittle
look like a morphine addict!

16:06.767 --> 16:10.867
There was a time
when I wanted to leave St. Olaf.

16:10.934 --> 16:13.300
I just didn't feel
it was big enough.

16:13.367 --> 16:16.133
I had my eye
on the great white way.

16:16.200 --> 16:20.367
So I went to St. Gustav,
the city that never naps.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.200
That first night, I walked
around in amazement.

16:26.266 --> 16:29.066
They had their own Fotomat!

16:29.133 --> 16:35.066
Of course, it wasn't as large as
the Fotomats you see today,

16:35.133 --> 16:37.133
here's the scary part.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.734
Suddenly, I realized
I was this frightened little girl

16:40.800 --> 16:42.367
alone in the big city.

16:42.433 --> 16:44.133
Accident, my foot!

16:46.934 --> 16:48.400
It started to rain.

16:48.467 --> 16:51.867
I stood in the middle of
the town square and cried.

16:51.934 --> 16:54.600
Gloria was the one
who had to get the rabies shot.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.867
I was a biter.

17:00.867 --> 17:04.166
There I was, drenched,
and someone yelled out,

17:04.233 --> 17:07.100
"Don't you have enough sense
to come in out of the rain?"

17:08.100 --> 17:09.633
Well, then it hit me.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.066
And when I went home
to St. Olaf,

17:12.133 --> 17:15.333
I passed on this
bit of street-smart savvy.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.233
The next thing you know,
in St. Olaf,

17:20.300 --> 17:23.033
the in thing was
coming in out of the rain.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.233
I was the town celebrity

17:28.300 --> 17:31.567
until the phrase, "Watch out
for that tractor" caught on.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.333
What in hell does this have
to do with sisters?

17:36.400 --> 17:37.667
Didn't I mention?

17:37.734 --> 17:42.300
St. Olaf and St. Gustav
were sister cities.

17:42.367 --> 17:46.467
And how did Mrs. Doolittle's
hair get singed?

17:46.533 --> 17:49.900
Did it herself? I think not.

17:51.767 --> 17:54.667
I had very bad fight
with my sister once.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.066
Oh, really?
Tell us.

17:56.133 --> 17:59.867
I turned her over
to secret police.

17:59.934 --> 18:00.734
And?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.500
I turned her over
to secret police.

18:02.567 --> 18:03.667
No more to tell.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.233
(calm music playing)

18:11.633 --> 18:16.066
<i>♪ When the moon hits your eyes</i>
<i>Like a big pizza pie ♪</i>

18:16.133 --> 18:18.800
<i>♪ That's amore ♪</i>

18:18.867 --> 18:20.900

18:20.967 --> 18:23.033

18:23.100 --> 18:24.000

18:24.066 --> 18:25.567
Oh, Ma, that's lovely.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.300
-What?
-You're singing.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.500
That was me?

18:30.433 --> 18:32.700
I was gonna ask you
to turn off the radio.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.100
Ladies, ladies,
I have very bad news.

18:38.166 --> 18:41.834
I must shorten my stay.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.734
Move the coffee table.
I want to do a cartwheel.

18:50.033 --> 18:52.433
I must return to
Czechoslovakia immediately

18:52.500 --> 18:55.900
because of something
very valuable I learned here.

18:55.967 --> 18:59.200
You finally understood
what I said in the bookstore.

18:59.266 --> 19:03.867
It was story Rose told
about going to St. Gustav,

19:03.934 --> 19:05.667
learning to come
in out of the rain--

19:05.734 --> 19:07.467
My very favorite doll!

19:09.800 --> 19:12.200
Dorothy, let it go.

19:14.133 --> 19:16.867
Anyway, that trip changed her life.

19:16.934 --> 19:19.166
Now I must have courage
to change mine.

19:19.233 --> 19:21.500
I'm going back
with what I learned here.

19:21.567 --> 19:24.100
It didn't change my life,
I just went home.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.233
Shut up, she's leaving.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.333
See, I left Czechoslovakia
because I was afraid of change,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.166
afraid of the new freedom.

19:32.233 --> 19:35.433
But now I see in America
freedom is change,

19:35.500 --> 19:38.066
always changing for the better idea.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.967
I want to be part
of the future of my country.

19:41.033 --> 19:42.233
So I'm going home.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.433
You got that from my story?

19:44.500 --> 19:46.333
No, Vanna White's book.

19:48.667 --> 19:49.667
I told you.

19:49.734 --> 19:54.667
Now I must go pack my things. And
again, Rose, thank you for story.

19:57.266 --> 19:59.734
You know, isn't life funny?

19:59.800 --> 20:02.333
Last night in bed I told myself,

20:02.400 --> 20:05.834
"Nobody listens to your stories,
Rose. Quit telling them."

20:05.900 --> 20:09.734
I swore I'd never tell another story
as long as I live,

20:09.800 --> 20:11.233
then you hear something like this

20:11.300 --> 20:14.867
and you realize these stories
make a difference.

20:14.934 --> 20:16.600
Oh...

20:17.734 --> 20:19.367
You know,
something sort of like that

20:19.433 --> 20:21.367
happened to Hans Fleeglefleister.

20:21.433 --> 20:23.834
(doorbell rings)

20:23.900 --> 20:25.133
I hope it's death.

20:27.133 --> 20:28.567
Get it, Rose.

20:28.633 --> 20:29.867
Okey-dokey.

20:33.133 --> 20:35.867
Charmaine! Blanche,
look who's here. It's Charmaine.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.100
Oh, good. Ringside seats.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.767
What do you want?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.967
Among other things,
your apology.

20:45.033 --> 20:49.734
Unless I missed a news flash,
hell did not freeze over today.

20:49.800 --> 20:50.967
Anything else?

20:51.033 --> 20:53.033
Yes. Big daddy's pocket watch.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.834
It's a family heirloom.

20:54.900 --> 20:57.400
As far as I'm concerned,
you're no longer family.

20:57.467 --> 21:01.533
You said it's in your room.
Which room is that?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.734
Turnstile at the end of the hall.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.700
So, anyway,
Hans Fleeglefleister...

21:14.166 --> 21:15.867
Get out of my room!

21:15.934 --> 21:19.133
Not till I find that watch.
Now where is it?

21:19.200 --> 21:23.333
I'll never tell,
unlike you who tells everything.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.734
You had no right to rip off
my life for profit.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.300
I wish my bank account
was as big as your ego.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.066
You listen, and you listen good.

21:35.133 --> 21:37.767
My book is based on my life.

21:37.834 --> 21:40.433
Oh, that book just drips
Blanche Devereaux.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.800
Only the names have been changed
to protect the satisfied.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.133
You think you're the only
one who wakes up

21:47.200 --> 21:49.166
to smiles and Roses.

21:49.233 --> 21:51.333
How about that inscription,

21:51.400 --> 21:53.767
how I'd inspired you
more than I'll ever know?

21:53.834 --> 21:56.066
I write the same thing to everybody.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.600
It's just like signing yearbooks.

21:57.667 --> 22:01.867
You always wrote the same thing,
"You were the first."

22:03.834 --> 22:06.600
Wrote it, hell.
I had a stamp made.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.700
Oh, I guess I've just been a fool.

22:13.667 --> 22:17.633
Blanche, we're an awful lot alike.
Too much alike.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.800
That's probably
why we never got along.

22:19.867 --> 22:25.166
That's also why you thought
the book was about you.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.934
My God, you're right.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.467
Oh, except for that part
where Vixen is terrified

22:30.533 --> 22:32.533
of losing her looks
and growing old alone.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.100
I've never felt like that.

22:35.166 --> 22:37.133
Of course. Me, neither.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.767
That's what makes it fiction.

22:46.967 --> 22:49.934
You remember the other day when
you said you thought it was time

22:50.000 --> 22:51.400
that we were friends again?

22:54.066 --> 22:56.200
I believe I'm ready to try.

22:56.266 --> 22:57.266
Oh!

23:01.900 --> 23:05.133
Oh, Blanche!
Oh...

23:08.200 --> 23:10.033
Come on, I'll make you
a big cup of coffee.

23:10.100 --> 23:12.367
Oh, darling, I smudged your makeup.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.333
Oh, I messed up your hair.

23:24.266 --> 23:27.934
(theme music playing)
