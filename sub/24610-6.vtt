<i>Where in the...?</i>

00:02.911 --> 00:07.446
<i>No, I'm sure it was...
I swear, if that girl...</i>

00:07.448 --> 00:10.516
- Lanaluakalani!
- Yes, Father?

00:10.518 --> 00:12.985
Come in here this very instant!

00:12.987 --> 00:16.055
I tell you, this is the last straw!

00:16.056 --> 00:18.457
- Pff.
- Do not "pff" me, woman!

00:18.459 --> 00:21.160
That child of yours has gone too far!

00:21.162 --> 00:24.596
I tell you, this time,
I shall really punish her!

00:26.233 --> 00:28.667
- You called, Father?
- Where is it?!

00:28.669 --> 00:32.186
- Where is what?
- The map... to the sacred tupua!

00:32.220 --> 00:35.607
<i>- Tupua?
- Oka atua, do not play dumb with me!</i>

00:35.609 --> 00:39.010
You know exactly
what I am talking about, child.

00:39.012 --> 00:43.348
- Now where is it?!
- I'm sure I don't know.

00:43.350 --> 00:46.217
And why would anyone want a map
to some moldy old statue?

00:46.219 --> 00:48.186
Because of its magical powers.

00:48.188 --> 00:51.907
- Oh, that's just a silly native legend.
- Do you even...?

00:51.908 --> 00:54.792
- We're natives!
- You know what I mean.

00:54.794 --> 00:59.129
I know what you think I mean.
I mean I...

00:59.131 --> 01:01.298
You know what I think?!

01:01.300 --> 01:04.669
<i>I think you made some sort
of deal with this ese Mai fafo,</i>

01:04.671 --> 01:06.855
- the German.
- Whaaat?!

01:06.856 --> 01:11.476
Yes. And I think, in
your profound ignorance

01:11.478 --> 01:13.510
of the awesome power of the tupua,

01:13.512 --> 01:16.646
- you gave him the map!
- Whaaat?

01:16.648 --> 01:19.816
In exchange for enough money
to go live among the papalangi

01:19.818 --> 01:24.754
in New York City again and open another...
 What was it?

01:24.756 --> 01:26.756
- Failed art gallery?
- Oh, come on!

01:26.758 --> 01:29.460
There was this little thing
called The Great Depression!

01:29.462 --> 01:31.795
Well, and you don't know
anything about art.

01:31.797 --> 01:35.198
- I do so!
- Oh, please.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.134
You thought the Dutch Masters
were just a kind of cigar.

01:38.136 --> 01:40.871
 I told you that in confidence!

01:40.873 --> 01:42.472
You have raised a fool!

01:42.474 --> 01:44.808
Because the tupua is a legend
for a reason,

01:44.810 --> 01:47.443
and you have no idea of its power!

01:47.445 --> 01:51.247
And once that German snake
finds it, he will be long gone,

01:51.249 --> 01:53.816
so I hope at least
he paid you in advance!

01:53.818 --> 01:57.166
Excuse me.

01:58.689 --> 02:01.857
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

02:01.859 --> 02:04.393
Well, if that sneaky
little schnitzel thinks

02:04.395 --> 02:06.428
he's gonna flimflam
Princess Lanaluakalani,

02:06.430 --> 02:08.130
he has got another thing...

02:16.507 --> 02:18.306
Are you out of your mind?!

02:18.308 --> 02:21.543
<i>- Sacrebleu!
- Oh! </i>

02:21.545 --> 02:24.212
What the hell is the matter
with you people?

02:24.214 --> 02:27.315
Ow! Well, I,
for one, am starving,

02:27.317 --> 02:31.353
so please tell me you have oysters.

03:13.414 --> 03:16.114
Me? Who the hell
taught him how to drive?

Oh, for the...

03:21.689 --> 03:24.823
None of your beeswax.
Wait. Where were you going?

03:24.825 --> 03:26.892
- None of...
- We're searching for a sacred idol.

03:26.894 --> 03:28.327
- What?!
- Goddamn it!

03:28.329 --> 03:31.848
- No, you can' I... forbid it!
- Excuse me?

03:31.849 --> 03:34.900
I forbid it.
As princess, I forbid the looting

03:34.902 --> 03:39.938
of Mitimotu's cultural artifacts
by you, you... Europeans!

03:39.940 --> 03:42.473
- Code for "white."
- And what of it?

03:42.475 --> 03:44.409
And what color are your Germans, huh?

03:44.411 --> 03:47.012
Damn it, the Germans.

03:47.014 --> 03:48.946
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey. Whoa, whoa.

03:48.948 --> 03:52.116
- Where do you think you're going?
- To beat the Germans to the idol.

03:52.118 --> 03:54.319
No, we are gonna beat Archer to it.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.355
- Archer?!
- Yes. So get in line, sister.

03:57.357 --> 03:59.457
Oh-ho, I'm at the head of it.

03:59.459 --> 04:02.193
Why you little...
Do something!

04:02.195 --> 04:05.129
<i>I, uh... commandeer this véhicule!</i>

04:05.131 --> 04:07.998
You what?

04:18.269 --> 04:19.935
<i>Woohoo!</i>

04:19.938 --> 04:22.973
All right! Enough fun.
Now back to business.

04:22.975 --> 04:24.908
<i>Ja, shooting those damn cannibals.</i>

04:24.910 --> 04:27.944
- Remember, you promised we could.
- Don't worry, men.

04:27.946 --> 04:30.847
We will kill anyone who dares
to interfere with our mission

04:30.849 --> 04:33.449
to bring the ultimate power
to the Fatherland!

04:37.589 --> 04:40.756
<i>♪ It's a long way to go... ♪</i>

04:58.843 --> 05:02.845
All right, already. Come on!
We don't need all this junk.

05:02.847 --> 05:06.235
- That crate is just gin.
- And vermouth.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.249
Now move it, big boy.

05:07.251 --> 05:10.740
We can't let Sterling
beat us to that damn idol.

05:11.321 --> 05:14.022
- That won't be too hard.
- Goddamn it, bird!

05:14.024 --> 05:15.557
Because he's stuck in quicksand!

05:15.559 --> 05:16.624
- What? Where?
- Really?!

05:16.626 --> 05:18.060
Quicksand. Pam, too.

05:18.062 --> 05:20.695
And I don't know
how much time they have left.

05:20.697 --> 05:22.497
- Before...?
- They die!

05:22.499 --> 05:25.133
Do you think it's enough time
for us to toodle on over,

05:25.135 --> 05:28.364
grab the idol, and then
come back and save them?

05:28.399 --> 05:30.805
- No!
- Don't get chippy with me, bird!

05:30.807 --> 05:32.740
I'm with her.
First we secure the idol,

05:32.742 --> 05:35.043
- and then we can rescue them.
- Exactly.

05:35.045 --> 05:37.046
For the love of God, woman!

05:37.047 --> 05:41.449
- Your son... is going... to die!
- Oh, all right.

05:41.451 --> 05:43.985
Take us to the damn quicksand.

05:43.987 --> 05:46.753
But I'll bet you dollars to
donuts, they've already escaped,

05:46.755 --> 05:50.198
found the idol,
and are just yucking it up!

05:56.935 --> 05:59.336
Don't!
Don't say a word.

05:59.338 --> 06:01.604
I'm mad enough at you as it is.

06:05.343 --> 06:08.879
I was gonna say I wonder
what I'm gonna taste like.

06:18.491 --> 06:21.191
'Cause this whole crazy thing's
kind of got me thinking

06:21.193 --> 06:24.762
about if I'd ever, you know,
like, eat a person.

06:24.764 --> 06:26.363
And not in a starvation-type deal,

06:26.365 --> 06:28.098
like the Donner Party or whatever.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.466
That goes without saying.

06:29.468 --> 06:31.768
Your fat white ass is pioneer jerky.

06:31.770 --> 06:34.771
I'm talking about
where you voluntarily eat a guy

06:34.773 --> 06:37.974
like he's just damn dinner.
Or a woman.

06:37.976 --> 06:40.344
Ooh, or a teenage girl.

06:40.346 --> 06:41.978
But I wouldn't want her to get killed

06:41.980 --> 06:43.780
just so I could eat her,
so maybe... I don't know.

06:43.782 --> 06:46.850
What if it was one of these native
girl's confirmation or whatever?

06:46.852 --> 06:49.185
So she gets a ceremonial bath,
scrubbed head to toe,

06:49.187 --> 06:51.320
and then her whole body gets shaved.

06:51.322 --> 06:53.189
- Why...?
- Shut up. Let me finish.

06:53.191 --> 06:55.191
But then, on the way to the ceremony,

06:55.193 --> 06:57.060
this tender, hairless young thing

06:57.062 --> 06:59.328
has a massive
yet painless brain aneurysm

06:59.330 --> 07:02.032
and falls into a vat of braising liquid.

07:02.034 --> 07:04.795
- Why the hell would...
- Wow!

07:04.830 --> 07:05.334
- What the...?
- Huh?

07:05.336 --> 07:07.403
You just described,
almost word for word,

07:07.405 --> 07:10.406
what's gonna happen to you guys
over the next two days.

07:10.408 --> 07:12.408
I mean,
is that goose bumps or what?

07:12.410 --> 07:14.410
- Who...?
- E-Except for the aneurysm.

07:14.412 --> 07:17.149
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Noah.

07:17.184 --> 07:20.348
<i>- Besso ekla baht!
- Ek eklan oki.</i>

07:20.350 --> 07:24.453
- Wait, you speak their language?
- Uh, yeah, I should hope so.

07:24.455 --> 07:26.889
I mean, I've been here
almost four years now, so...

07:26.891 --> 07:29.491
Four years?!
So there's no way to escape?

07:29.493 --> 07:32.895
Um... Well, I suppose, I...
Well, there's probably...

07:32.897 --> 07:34.496
Oh, gosh. I mean...

07:34.498 --> 07:36.298
- I don't know.
- What do you mean

07:36.300 --> 07:38.300
you don't know, idiot?
Haven't you even tried?

07:38.302 --> 07:40.835
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not their captive.

07:40.837 --> 07:43.838
I'm doing my doctoral
dissertation on the Mua Mua.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.173
I'm an anthropologist.

07:45.175 --> 07:47.842
- Wh... A spider scientist?
- What?

07:47.844 --> 07:49.177
That's an arachnologist.

07:49.179 --> 07:51.179
- Like you would know!
- No, no, it is.

07:51.181 --> 07:54.315
- An anthropologist...
- I know what an anthropologist is.

07:54.317 --> 07:56.050
- No, he doesn't.
- Nobody does!

07:56.052 --> 07:59.921
An anthropologist studies human beings
and their societies and cultures.

07:59.923 --> 08:01.522
The Mua Mua, for example...

08:01.524 --> 08:04.592
<i>- Zakila gizona.
- Ek ezan oki!</i>

08:04.594 --> 08:06.260
...are assholes.

08:06.262 --> 08:08.129
Yeah, right?
So then how 'bout it, man?

08:08.131 --> 08:09.863
- Help us escape.
- Yeah.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.599
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I couldn't do that.

08:11.601 --> 08:14.335
I-I'm here to document.
I can't interfere.

08:14.337 --> 08:17.338
- What?!
- Even after they ate your goddamn arm?

08:17.340 --> 08:19.273
Oh. Yeah.

08:19.275 --> 08:21.609
<i>- Man, that was really...
- Eggelak!</i>

08:21.611 --> 08:23.210
<i>Dongay emakume!</i>

08:23.212 --> 08:27.213
- What is she saying?
- That I taste like chicken.

08:27.215 --> 08:31.484
Which, to them, is, like, the worst.

08:31.486 --> 08:33.525
- What the...?
- What's that?

08:33.543 --> 08:36.183
Oh. Uh, okay.
Uh, well, I got to go.

08:36.217 --> 08:38.558
Uh, maybe I'll see you guys
later or maybe not. Okay, bye!

08:38.559 --> 08:41.260
- Wait, what was that?!
- Nothing!

08:42.397 --> 08:44.597
I think it was something.

08:44.599 --> 08:46.399
- No shit.
- Yep.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.401
Well, if we get out
of this alive somehow,

08:48.403 --> 08:51.137
we should definitely open
a detective agency.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.406
Ooh!

08:53.408 --> 08:56.888
Aw, damn, but we're not
getting out alive, huh?

08:56.923 --> 08:57.977
Nope.

08:57.979 --> 09:00.646
Well?
Where the hell are they, bird?

09:00.648 --> 09:04.249
I-I don't get it. They were right
here, up to their necks in it!

09:04.251 --> 09:07.252
- I ought to wring your neck!
- This was all just a ruse.

09:07.254 --> 09:09.168
- What? A ruse?
- Oh, come on.

09:09.190 --> 09:10.656
- A ruse?
- He set me up!

09:10.658 --> 09:13.358
This mite-riddled bird's just stalling us

09:13.360 --> 09:15.460
so that Sterling can
get to the idol first.

09:15.462 --> 09:16.562
- Damn it, bird!
- Seriously?

09:16.564 --> 09:19.064
No! Whoa!
First of all, I am...

09:19.066 --> 09:23.602
almost mite-free.
And, B, I swear, they were right here.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.604
Oh, go eat worms.
Come on, Reynaud,

09:25.606 --> 09:27.606
we can still beat him if we hurry.

09:27.608 --> 09:31.576
Look, there's boot prints
coming up out of the quicksand.

09:31.578 --> 09:33.211
- Really?
- No! - Ah, yes!

09:33.213 --> 09:35.880
And here's another set of boot prints.

09:35.882 --> 09:37.215
And over there, there...

09:37.217 --> 09:39.918
there's all these different
sets of bare footprints.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.253
Pretty muscular, by the looks of them.

09:42.255 --> 09:44.189
- Muscular?
- And here,

09:44.191 --> 09:48.392
this trail is two barefoot men,
carrying a load between them,

09:48.394 --> 09:50.094
probably on, like,
a pole or something.

09:50.096 --> 09:51.929
See, they're, like, six feet apart.

09:51.931 --> 09:54.298
- That's about the size of a man.
- Or a party sub.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.400
- Look, can we just...
- Shut up!

09:56.402 --> 09:59.437
- Do you think it was...?
- Yes! It was clearly Archer.

09:59.439 --> 10:02.324
And then here's a trail of four men
carrying a much,

10:02.325 --> 10:05.175
- much heavier load.
- Ooh, which I bet was Pam.

10:05.177 --> 10:08.545
<i>Mon dieu, can it be Les cannibales?</i>

10:08.547 --> 10:10.480
Oh, my God.

10:10.482 --> 10:12.349
Well, but since they're
out of the quicksand...

10:12.351 --> 10:16.220
And about to be eaten! We have to
follow this trail and rescue them.

10:16.222 --> 10:18.155
No. No, no.
Uh-uh.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.390
As your princess, I demand
we get the idol first.

10:20.392 --> 10:22.325
As whose princess?

10:22.327 --> 10:23.360
<i>- Yeah, right?
- Exactement!</i>

10:23.362 --> 10:25.528
<i>Et tu, Doudou?</i>

10:25.530 --> 10:29.683
So we're just gonna go gallivanting
through this deadly jungle

10:29.684 --> 10:32.869
because this dodo says
she can see a trail?

10:32.871 --> 10:34.971
Do you seriously not?
It's so obvious.

10:34.973 --> 10:38.274
Then let's go.
Come on, Lady Baltimore.

10:41.980 --> 10:45.782
<i> Ew, look!
This guy has ringworm.</i>

10:45.944 --> 10:47.876
So, where do you think
everybody went?

10:47.878 --> 10:49.412
Who knows?
Probably taking a vote

10:49.414 --> 10:51.981
- on what sides to serve us with.
- Ooh...

10:51.983 --> 10:53.816
But I'm not sticking around
to find out.

10:53.818 --> 10:55.884
Well, unless you know
something I don't...

10:55.886 --> 10:59.354
- What, besides everything?
- Oh, hardy-har.

10:59.356 --> 11:03.158
Including, look, there's a piece
of, uh, whatchamacallit. Ob-Obsidian.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.127
- So?
- So we can cut the ropes with it, dummy.

11:06.129 --> 11:09.565
If I can just scrooch
down the pole, I can...

11:09.567 --> 11:12.067
- Get a splinter in your ass?
- I'm not gonna get a...

11:14.271 --> 11:15.803
Goddamn it.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.840
We'll see how funny...
you think it is

11:18.842 --> 11:20.842
when I leave you here.

11:20.844 --> 11:22.110
Oh...

11:22.112 --> 11:23.945
Does that mean
we're not getting married?

11:23.947 --> 11:25.447
You know, first of all, that was...

11:25.449 --> 11:28.883
- I just wanted you to die happy.
- Ha!

11:28.885 --> 11:30.585
And, two, I'm about this close

11:30.587 --> 11:32.553
to getting a new goddamn sidekick.

11:32.555 --> 11:36.190
- How is this Crackers's fault?
- Wha... Not Crackers!

11:36.192 --> 11:38.860
- You.
- You think I'm the sidekick?

11:38.992 --> 11:41.258
Yes, Lennie!

11:41.260 --> 11:44.461
- Well?
- Cut me loose.

11:44.463 --> 11:49.600
- I will, but only because I choose to.
- Well, bully for you.

11:49.602 --> 11:51.368
And, while you're at it,

11:51.370 --> 11:53.637
you can leave one hand
tied behind my back.

11:53.639 --> 11:56.039
- Why?
- So I can whip your ass fairly.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.375
Oh, my God, you are such a Lennie.

11:58.377 --> 12:00.576
Well, if we get out of this bullshit...

12:00.578 --> 12:04.180
If we do, it's only because I
unleashed the power of obsidian.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.350
You won't have old Pam
to kick around anymore because...

12:07.352 --> 12:10.720
Shh. Stop. Stop it.
Stop cutting.

12:10.722 --> 12:12.522
What?

12:13.224 --> 12:17.026
- Is your dick hard?
- No.

12:17.028 --> 12:21.664
Then what... is touching...
my ass?

12:21.666 --> 12:24.500
- Also nothing.
- Oh, for the... Ew!

12:24.502 --> 12:27.670
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
- Dude, that is a hard dick.

12:27.672 --> 12:31.707
- It's not that hard.
- Oh, please. I bet it hasn't been that hard

12:31.709 --> 12:33.876
since the time the Army
checked you for a hernia.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.546
- I told you that in confidence.
- Yeah? Well, I ain't your priest.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.649
Speaking of hard dicks...

12:40.651 --> 12:43.385
I also told you that in confidence!

12:48.215 --> 12:50.915
Oh, don't flatter
yourself, it was just a reflex.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.952
- Uh-huh.
- An involuntary biological response

12:53.954 --> 12:55.820
to physical and visual stimuli.

12:55.822 --> 12:58.356
Well, then I hope to God this helps.

12:58.358 --> 13:01.626
- Ka-kow.
- Yeah, that's... wait.

13:01.628 --> 13:04.662
- What's the opposite of stimuli?
- That.

13:04.664 --> 13:08.066
It's not supposed to be sexy, it's
protective. In case there's thorns.

13:08.068 --> 13:11.269
- Okay, Master Coconut.
- Nobody gets that.

13:11.271 --> 13:13.937
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you think you're doing?

13:13.939 --> 13:15.072
Making piña coladas.

13:15.074 --> 13:16.874
What the hell's it
look like we're doing?

13:16.876 --> 13:20.678
- Uhh... I genuinely don't know.
- We're escaping.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.281
Wait, what? No. No, you can't.
I'll be punished.

13:23.283 --> 13:26.950
- Not if you're dead.
- Well, you say that...

13:26.952 --> 13:28.886
Hey, buddy, no shit, she will kill you

13:28.888 --> 13:30.921
- like an innocent baby rabbit.
- Goddamn it.

13:30.923 --> 13:34.691
So what's the best way out of here?

13:34.693 --> 13:36.894
Well, that's the thing,
there isn't one now.

13:36.896 --> 13:40.563
The conch is telling the Mua Mua
warriors to prepare for battle.

13:40.565 --> 13:41.865
- What, why?
- Well, apparently,

13:41.867 --> 13:44.967
a scout saw another group of warriors
headed toward the village.

13:44.969 --> 13:46.969
What other warriors?

13:46.971 --> 13:50.607
I swear to God, if those
cannibals don't have a bar,

13:50.609 --> 13:54.544
- I may literally die.
- Oh, my God, at an oyster bar.

13:54.546 --> 13:57.681
I can pretty much guarantee they
don't have either of those things.

13:57.683 --> 14:00.016
Savages.

14:00.018 --> 14:01.684
<i>Well, you two idiots
can stick around</i>

14:01.686 --> 14:03.652
to find out and then get eaten,

14:03.654 --> 14:05.855
but I'm gonna go find
that goddamn idol.

14:05.857 --> 14:08.958
Wait. What idol?
You mean the tupua?

14:08.960 --> 14:12.028
- Whatever it's called, I...
- How do you know where it is?

14:12.030 --> 14:13.562
We got a map.

14:13.564 --> 14:16.031
- Whoa.
- A secret map, that is a secret!

14:16.033 --> 14:18.833
- Who's he gonna tell?
- Oh, man.

14:18.868 --> 14:22.527
The tupua would be the greatest
archaeological find of the-the...

14:22.562 --> 14:25.507
well, probably just the past
couple of years, but still.

14:25.509 --> 14:26.775
Still what?
You're not coming.

14:26.777 --> 14:30.118
- Oh, come on, I-I know the jungle.
- No.

14:30.153 --> 14:33.215
I-I can read any native
petroglyphs we might find.

14:33.217 --> 14:35.063
- No, I said.
- I know how to get past

14:35.190 --> 14:37.808
all the giant boulders
and poison darts and stuff.

14:39.156 --> 14:40.688
The... do what, now?

14:40.690 --> 14:42.324
- Yeah, do huh?
- Oh, man.

14:42.326 --> 14:44.826
Yeah, the legends all say
the tupua is hidden

14:44.828 --> 14:46.694
deep inside a labyrinth
of shafts and tunnels,

14:46.696 --> 14:49.096
just packed with deadly booby traps.

14:49.098 --> 14:52.099
- So...
- That's why you got to know your petroglyphs.

14:52.101 --> 14:54.635
Okay, change of plans,
you're coming with us.

14:54.637 --> 14:57.372
Yeah!
Oh, wait, h-hang on. Hang on.

14:57.374 --> 15:01.676
I-I don't, I don't have to wear
one of those, do I?

15:01.678 --> 15:04.379
And can we stop
and rest a while?

15:04.381 --> 15:06.380
I think my electrolyte levels are low.

15:06.382 --> 15:08.883
- Gin levels.
- Also.

15:08.885 --> 15:11.085
No, I think we're getting close
to a village or something.

15:11.087 --> 15:13.153
Look, there's a ton
of footprints around here.

15:15.124 --> 15:17.324
Plus, this?

15:17.326 --> 15:22.763
Well, as long as we're close.

15:22.765 --> 15:24.998
Please, I can't leave
without my dissertation.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.734
- Yes, you can, now come on.
- It's four years of writing.

15:27.736 --> 15:29.636
Plus, I had to make
the paper from scratch.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.140
- Ay!
- Oh, shit!

15:31.175 --> 15:31.938
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Kekkozat?</i>

15:31.940 --> 15:33.907
<i>- What, oh, no, shh.
- Kekkozat!</i>

15:33.909 --> 15:35.776
- No. Shh.
- Punch her in the face.

15:35.778 --> 15:37.210
<i>- What?
- Kekkozat!</i>

15:37.212 --> 15:38.311
<i>- Punch her in the face.
- Kekkozat!</i>

15:38.313 --> 15:39.979
I can't punch an old lady in... ow!

15:39.981 --> 15:42.949
<i>- Dongay ekakume!
- Whoa.</i>

15:42.951 --> 15:44.650
- Yeah, not cool.
- What?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.585
<i>- But you just told me to...
- Lakundu!</i>

15:46.587 --> 15:48.955
<i>Lakundu! Lakundu!</i>

15:50.858 --> 15:52.825
Now can we go, please?

15:52.827 --> 15:55.027
But my dissertation...

15:55.029 --> 15:56.929
actually had kind of a weak premise.

15:56.931 --> 16:00.232
<i>Ketak.
Ketakalak.</i>

16:02.002 --> 16:04.336
<i>Batu! Batu, Batu!</i>

16:06.607 --> 16:09.642
Goddamn it!
Eat a dick, cannibals.

16:09.644 --> 16:12.044
It's funny you say that.

16:12.046 --> 16:14.246
- Actually...
- It's a figure of speech, Noah.

16:14.248 --> 16:17.149
- No, let him finish.
- Oh, my God.

16:17.151 --> 16:19.584
I was gonna say
that they don't eat the penis.

16:19.586 --> 16:21.686
The testicles, though...

16:21.688 --> 16:24.222
<i>- Nok geziak!
- Lakana.</i>

16:32.265 --> 16:33.932
In there.

16:33.934 --> 16:38.035
<i>Schmidt!
Was dauert so Lange?</i>

16:38.037 --> 16:40.572
<i>Weil mein Schwanz so Lang ist.</i>

16:40.574 --> 16:41.906
<i>Nun beeile dich!</i>

16:41.908 --> 16:45.909
<i>Ja, ja.
Komm runter, Junge.</i>

17:02.695 --> 17:04.895
Seriously?

17:04.896 --> 17:08.866
<i>- Scheisse.
- Was, hast Du auf deine Schue gepisst?</i>

17:10.836 --> 17:13.136
<i>Schmidt?</i>

17:13.137 --> 17:14.905
What the hell?
Why did you do that?

17:14.906 --> 17:16.973
- Guys?
- What? He was gonna wipe them out.

17:16.976 --> 17:20.193
- Yeah, problem solved.
- Guys.

17:20.228 --> 17:22.112
- What?
- What?!

17:24.316 --> 17:28.751
- He wants us to come with him.
- Gee, thanks, Noah.

17:28.753 --> 17:30.586
Oh, you're welcome.

17:32.524 --> 17:37.159
<i>Zwei MÃ¤nner,
gehen und finden Schmidt.</i>

17:37.321 --> 17:39.655
<i>Eh? Zakila koko?</i>

17:39.657 --> 17:42.658
He wants to know why you stuffed
your genitals into a coconut.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.460
Because I hate this goddamn island.

17:48.236 --> 17:50.569
<i>Zu Laguna Mua Mua.</i>

17:50.571 --> 17:53.204
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
He says you saved their lives,

17:53.206 --> 17:55.674
so now you're friends of the Mua Mua.

17:55.676 --> 17:57.938
<i>Batu baruka zu zaku.</i>

17:57.973 --> 18:01.173
And that together,
we will kill these white devils.

18:01.208 --> 18:02.307
<i>Nik andu.</i>

18:02.342 --> 18:04.883
- Uh, no offense.
- None taken?

18:04.885 --> 18:06.551
<i>Teko besta.</i>

18:06.553 --> 18:08.519
And then, we'll have a huge feast.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.588
<i>Ekari zim.</i>

18:10.590 --> 18:14.715
- Oh, my gosh, really? Wow.
- What?

18:14.750 --> 18:17.362
Ah, well, he said even I could come.

18:17.364 --> 18:21.814
- Do you not normally go to the feasts?
- Oh, no, no. God, no.

18:21.909 --> 18:25.447
They're... super racist.

18:27.572 --> 18:31.207
Well, guess you can find out
what a human being tastes like after all.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.710
 Oh, man, and this
is probably gonna sound weird,

18:33.712 --> 18:37.594
- but I could kind of eat.
- A person?

18:37.629 --> 18:40.336
Not a whole person, asshole.

18:41.319 --> 18:44.129
But maybe, like, a drumstick?
