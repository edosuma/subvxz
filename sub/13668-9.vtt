00:01.000 --> 00:04.080
Keep in mind the recent campaign
slogan, "Do it for Boston."

00:04.080 --> 00:06.200
Tonight, on St Elsewhere...

00:06.200 --> 00:08.360
You are married to a rising star.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.440
Would you call yourself
sexually promiscuous?

00:10.440 --> 00:11.840
My sex life is none of your concern.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.240
My sex life is none of your concern.

00:14.240 --> 00:14.960
Is he gay?

00:14.960 --> 00:16.520
Is he gay?

00:16.520 --> 00:17.880
Sandy.  Some guy?

00:17.880 --> 00:18.960
Are you crazy?

00:18.960 --> 00:20.720
Peter, this scares me to death.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.520
To date, not one single doctor
or nurse has ever contracted AIDS
from a patient.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.560
I don't want to handle the blood.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.880
We are observing precautions.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.440
We are observing precautions.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.440
The oldest fairy in the kingdom
came to the ball uninvited

00:34.280 --> 00:37.000
and she laid a spell
on a little kid.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.280
Fairytales are for children.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.280
She's apparently has been receiving
small doses of anabolic steroids.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.240
A blood drive may seem like
another unsolicited chore.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.840
We'll need help from all of you.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.880
It's a new needle?

00:47.880 --> 00:48.560
Here goes.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.600
Here goes.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.800
I'm not giving blood,
I'm not getting blood,

00:53.800 --> 00:57.800
I am not even handling blood
until Mr AIDS is out of here!

02:50.960 --> 02:52.080
How long was she out?

02:52.080 --> 02:53.640
Less than a minute. She fainted.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.200
She couldn't finish the match.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.560
Some kind of tournament was it?

02:56.560 --> 02:59.320
Yeah, regional quarterfinals,
indoor junior championship.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.400
We won Connecticut
and she was leading.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.680
I'll take a look.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.240
Does she ever faint at school?

03:05.240 --> 03:07.320
Never. The way things are,

03:07.320 --> 03:10.360
she is definitely pointed
with one year in college.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.360
If everything goes according
to plan, she turns pro.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.600
BP is 110/60. Heart rate, 72.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.560
Well, there's nothing
wrong with that.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.560
The blood's on its way to the lab.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.720
The blood's on its way to the lab.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.800
Still kind of dizzy.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.640
Want to just look around?

03:27.640 --> 03:29.200
How long have you had this acne?

03:29.200 --> 03:31.720
Comes and goes.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.960
Is she taking any medication?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.160
Vitamins.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.720
And that's all?

03:36.720 --> 03:40.360
She hasn't missed
a tournament all winter.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.720
Well, uh, I want to get a
neurological consult, Mr Greely,

03:43.720 --> 03:46.520
and I want to keep her overnight,
till we get the test results back.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.520
She can handle that. We planned
to be here till Thursday.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.040
It was the day of the finals.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.680
Shirley, could you
call Dr Ridley for me?

03:53.680 --> 03:56.880
You want Ridley for a neuro consult?
He's a psychiatrist.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.880
I know. There's something
out of sync with this guy.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.240
Melissa, you are going to like
Dr Ridley a lot. Come with me.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.560
I respectfully urge you
to make a contribution to...

04:17.560 --> 04:19.399
Make that "generous contribution"

04:19.399 --> 04:21.600
to the proposed
Senior Citizens Home Fund.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.640
Sincerely yours?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.600
Make that, "Best, Tony."

04:24.600 --> 04:26.400
Do you think he'll give anything?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.040
I think if we keep at him, he will.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.720
I'd like to get
the mayor on this, too.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.760
I'll put in a call.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.880
We postponed your lunch with
the Parks And Recreation Commission.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.160
Yeah, don't reschedule that yet.
What else?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.720
You've got this shindig
till about 12:30 or so,

04:38.720 --> 04:40.280
then St Allegis after that.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.960
Yeah. Did you reach my wife?

04:41.960 --> 04:43.760
Oh, she's meeting you at the museum.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.760
Guest list.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.080
Half the council is dropping by.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.280
Guess I got re-elected.

04:54.280 --> 04:57.280
I worked with him
on the last campaign, and yourself?

04:57.280 --> 04:59.120
Tony Gifford and I go way back.

04:59.120 --> 05:03.120
We were allies on all
those community board battles.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.640
The good old days.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.360
Bussing, zoning laws. Rats.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.360
Rats? How are things at City Hall?

05:10.360 --> 05:13.920
Sandy! Excuse us?

05:13.920 --> 05:15.880
So, where is our Councilman?

05:15.880 --> 05:19.520
Oh, he's on his way.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.880
Some turnout.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.160
You are married to a rising star.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.160
APPLAUSE

05:36.040 --> 05:38.840
I've been asked to stop by
and make a few remarks.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.840
But it is against my principles
to interrupt genuine carousing.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.440
So a few is all you will get.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.240
I'm really happy we could create
this kind of coalition -

05:49.240 --> 05:52.000
black, brown, white,
a few people money,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.640
a lot of people with no money -

05:54.640 --> 05:58.280
but art lovers all - to get
those subsidy cuts rescinded.

05:58.280 --> 06:02.280
We won this fight,
but there are many more to come.

06:02.520 --> 06:06.520
Keep in mind the recent campaign
slogan, "Do it for Boston."

06:06.840 --> 06:10.840
Thank you, all.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.480
Short and sweet, right?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.880
Leave them wanting more.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.000
Hello, Joan.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.520
Since the mayor made you Health
Services Advisor, we don't see you.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.320
It keeps me pretty busy.
How's Sean doing?

06:29.320 --> 06:31.240
He started his first grade class.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.920
Time to go.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.200
See you.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.880
&lt; Give Sean a kiss good night.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.880
Another ribbon to cut?

06:43.960 --> 06:47.440
Come on, come on.
Salami, peanut butter...

06:47.440 --> 06:51.440
This is ridiculous!

06:54.920 --> 06:58.920
B negative, B positive.
No thanks.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.720
What is holding things up?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.720
You want fresh frozen plasma, right?

07:02.720 --> 07:04.320
She's 70, we need packed cells.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.000
Good luck.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.120
This isn't Haematology,
it's happy hour.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.920
Lan Calder is in touch
with the Red Cross.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.400
Why bother? It's a citywide shortage,
they won't have any to spare.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.920
Ah, got it!

07:16.920 --> 07:19.760
Hi, guys. Is that the last
of the universal donor?

07:19.760 --> 07:21.200
As far as we know.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.920
Uh-oh, Mr De Jacquemotte needs
that for his splenectomy later.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.560
That isn't critical. We've got
a woman waiting in emergency.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.280
Yeah, Jackie, you have to stand
in line like everyone else.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.920
First come, first served.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.120
More or less.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.400
I better get this to ER.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.040
Did you check all of these? I was
really psyched to do that operation.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.920
Elective surgery is a dirty word
these days. No blood, no cut.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.920
If I were you, I'd put
my scalpel back in the drawer.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.840
What do you know about
this fellow, Peter?

07:54.840 --> 07:58.840
Albert Markell. He's a white male,
34, married, one son.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.560
No prior history of major illness,

08:01.560 --> 08:05.560
no haemophilia,
no intravenous drug use.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.800
All right, let's check the symptoms.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.800
Well, he came in last week for tests,
complaining of recurrent fatigue,

08:12.720 --> 08:16.320
non-productive dry cough,
night sweating, swollen lymph nodes.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.120
Also, persistent low-grade fever
and shortness of breath.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.960
And his T-lymphocyte helper
suppressor ratio is way down low.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.040
And what does his elevated
CMD titre imply?

08:26.040 --> 08:28.280
Possible mononucleosis.

08:28.280 --> 08:32.280
Yeah... Yeah, but it just
doesn't all add up, Peter.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.440
His immune system's out
of kilter in some way.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.120
What about the biopsy on that
black and blue lesion on his arm?

08:38.120 --> 08:39.400
Has Pathology reported yet?

08:39.400 --> 08:42.880
Another half hour or so...
Any ideas?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.760
Is he gay?

08:44.760 --> 08:46.120
Are you kidding?

08:46.120 --> 08:47.320
Just wondering.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.880
You said he had a wife and child.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.240
So?

08:50.240 --> 08:51.960
What are you getting at?

08:51.960 --> 08:55.800
Well, this is no simple virus.
I mean, there are too main questions.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.800
I may be crazy, but the first thing
that came to my mind was AIDS.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.920
Listen, everybody, I know
we've all got our hands full today

09:07.920 --> 09:09.720
so I'm going to make this brief.

09:09.720 --> 09:13.440
Tomorrow and Friday, Boston is
mounting an emergency blood drive.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.040
Every hospital
is going to be involved.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.600
So we thought it would be good
if one of the residents

09:18.600 --> 09:21.280
would work in tandem with
a member of the nursing staff.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.240
That way they can coordinate things,
push everyone to donate.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.600
That'd be right up your alley.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.720
That'd be right up your alley.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.840
May I put in a word?

09:27.840 --> 09:30.760
A blood drive may seem like
another unsolicited chore,

09:30.760 --> 09:33.000
but it's a profoundly
serious undertaking.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.560
We're going to need help
from all of you.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.200
Not just the patsies we picked out.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.920
We all rely on blood.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.920
Dialysis, renal transplants,
ICUs, the Outpatient Unit,

09:44.960 --> 09:46.760
Leukaemia Ward, all of it.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.760
Blood is the lifeline for you,
me and St Allegis.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.720
After going over your schedules
for the next few days,

09:53.720 --> 09:55.840
we've decided to ask Shirley Daniels

09:55.840 --> 09:58.040
to represent the nursing
establishment.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.640
Great.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.120
Great.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.680
And from the resident pool,
Victor Ehrlich.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.320
LAUGHTER

10:04.320 --> 10:08.320
May I speak with you two after this,
please? OK, everybody, that's it.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.760
Congratulations, Shirley. We'll
break the record with you in charge.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.800
Thanks.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.600
Listen, I'll be glad to help
any time, except when I'm on call...

10:15.600 --> 10:19.120
or asleep.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.800
Am I really in charge?

10:20.800 --> 10:23.800
It's your baby,
however you two want to work it.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.200
It's nice to have responsibility
for a change. Ehrlich,
I'm counting on you.

10:27.200 --> 10:27.800
You're nuts.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.520
You're nuts.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.480
Listen, we're going to need
some things - posters, flyers...

10:33.480 --> 10:34.760
Noisemakers.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.520
Don't start. And a slogan.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.720
How about, "Give till it hurts.
America, open your veins."

10:39.720 --> 10:40.960
I don't think that would pull me in.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.000
I don't think that would pull me in.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.600
Boston Blood Blitz. BBB.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.080
Tippecanoe and Tyler, too.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.120
I appreciate your keeping
my being here quiet.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.560
I'm not eager for my constituents
or the other Council members

10:53.560 --> 10:54.920
to think I might be sick.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.040
Yeah, I realise why
you are using a pseudonym.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.880
It's also why checked in here
instead of someplace fancy downtown.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.200
We'll take that as a compliment. You
know, in spite of our public image,

11:05.200 --> 11:06.680
St Allegis is a fine facility.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.800
Of course, it's in my district.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.480
The nurse tells me
you had night sweats.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.960
Buckets.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.960
You're delayed hypersensitivity skin
test showed no discernible reaction.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.920
What does that mean?

11:21.920 --> 11:24.600
It means your immune system is down.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.600
We originally thought mono,
hepatitis or maybe CMV virus.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.920
And now what you think?

11:32.920 --> 11:36.160
Let me ask you this,
do you socialise a great deal?

11:36.160 --> 11:39.960
26 hours a day, Doctor. It's the
curse of being in the public eye.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.200
Right, yes, I know.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.040
Would you call yourself
sexually promiscuous?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.080
What do you mean promiscuous?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.840
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.200
My sex life is none of your concern.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.480
It's relevant or I wouldn't ask.
We're trying to get you
back on your feet.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.680
Fine, that's your job.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.440
Mr Gifford, your biopsy result
indicates KS,

12:01.440 --> 12:05.440
that's Kaposi's sarcoma,
a form of cancer.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.720
To the best of our knowledge,
you have AIDS.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.680
You're in the very early stages
of the syndrome

12:13.680 --> 12:17.600
and we're going to do our best
to make you comfortable.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.600
Oh, God.

12:24.720 --> 12:25.920
No, a little higher.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.640
This is as high as I go.
Why can't you get up here?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.720
Are you kidding?
This is an old ladder.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.920
What have we here?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.840
Shirley Daniels,
100 years of poster art.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.880
Tape.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.440
Can you believe this? I'm
a physician, I have lives to save.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.600
Nurses save lives, too, Ehrlich.
Tape, please.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.440
I love the symbolic red letters.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.360
I like that.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.480
It's crazy,
I could be serving humanity,

12:46.480 --> 12:48.600
but I'm bogged down
doing this busy work.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.280
You just stand around and criticise.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.360
Don't let the altitude
go to your head, Shirley.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.680
I think you're a little crooked
on one side.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.960
I think you're right.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.160
Would you give me some pliers
to shut him up?

13:00.160 --> 13:03.120
Here, spread the word.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.120
"For a good time, call Shirley."

13:12.040 --> 13:14.480
I thought technicians took blood.

13:14.480 --> 13:17.160
Well, the word is to keep
staff involvement to a minimum

13:17.160 --> 13:18.320
with your case.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.320
No-one wants unnecessary
rumours to get started.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.040
That's a lot of tubes.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.240
How many is that?

13:26.240 --> 13:30.240
13. And the last one.

13:30.920 --> 13:34.920
Lucky 13.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.160
This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, how can I have AIDS?

13:41.680 --> 13:44.600
So, it's just me and a bunch
of empty beds, huh?

13:44.600 --> 13:45.640
Previous victims?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.920
You know, you're pretty cool
about all this.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.000
Someone has to be.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.360
KNOCKING

13:51.360 --> 13:52.440
Hi.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.480
Hi.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.360
Dr White, this is my wife, Sandra.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.800
Next meet you, Mrs Markell.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.040
I can come back
if you still need him for tests.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.040
No, we're done. Someone will be in
with your lunch soon.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.480
So, how are you feeling?

14:17.480 --> 14:20.920
I think I'll skip
the jogging for today.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.280
Do they have any idea
what's the matter with you?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.720
More tests, you know?

14:25.720 --> 14:29.400
No, it...

14:29.400 --> 14:32.040
Tony.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.920
Something is wrong.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.760
We've been married for
eight years now, I can tell.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.440
Sandra.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.440
There's something you have to know.

14:47.200 --> 14:51.200
I need your help on this.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.080
'Dr Michael Ridell, radiology.
Stat. Dr Michael Ridell,

14:55.080 --> 14:56.720
'radiology. Stat.'

14:56.720 --> 14:57.760
What is that smell?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.600
Mexican fiesta plate.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.680
That will keep
Gastroenterology busy.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.800
It'll keep laundry busy. The guy down
the hall threw his burrito at me.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.880
I delivered it,
it's got to be my recipe.

15:07.880 --> 15:08.400
Look out!

15:08.400 --> 15:10.080
Look out!

15:10.080 --> 15:11.120
Nothing to it, right?

15:11.120 --> 15:12.880
Hey, gang way,
hot stuff coming through.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.520
Never thought I'd deal with
an AIDS patient. Hold this for me?

15:15.520 --> 15:16.960
AIDS? Is he gay?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.440
I don't know. According to him,

15:18.440 --> 15:20.320
not a haemophiliac,
homosexual or druggy.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.680
It's those that don't fit
in the category that scare me.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.720
Wait a minute.

15:23.720 --> 15:26.080
I hear it's transferred
by blood, sweat and semen.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.320
I loved their last album.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.000
Very funny,
but you don't have to treat the man.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.400
Or pick up his garbage.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.760
I'll be right back.

15:33.760 --> 15:37.760
Oh, relax, you have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.960
And the really weird thing is that
nobody knows how I picked it up.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.080
This is incredible.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.520
Are they sure?

15:48.520 --> 15:52.520
Well, as sure as they can be.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I don't get it.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.480
If you've never had a transfusion
and you've never used needles...

16:00.480 --> 16:01.800
Sandy.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.800
I'm just getting to that.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.280
You have been seeing someone,
haven't you?

16:10.280 --> 16:11.000
Sandy.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.880
Sandy.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.240
Some guy?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.600
Are you crazy?

16:16.600 --> 16:20.600
Sandy, no-one knows better
than you what my life is like.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.640
There are some women who think
that a politician is the next thing
to a movie star.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.640
I'm surrounded by them all day long
and they're always coming on to me.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.680
I guess one of them...

16:31.680 --> 16:35.200
..got it from
some boyfriend or other.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.280
It happened.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.720
I'm sorry.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.360
So where does this leave Sean and me?

16:42.360 --> 16:44.680
I care about you both. I love you!

16:44.680 --> 16:47.480
How can you say that?

16:47.480 --> 16:49.880
You don't give a damn about us!

16:49.880 --> 16:52.800
Did it ever occur to you that you
might have passed this on to me?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.680
Sandra...

16:54.680 --> 16:57.120
No, I don't think so. I mean...

16:57.120 --> 16:59.920
You don't think so?!
I don't believe this!

16:59.920 --> 17:03.920
I walk in here ten minutes ago
and now my whole life is destroyed.

17:04.599 --> 17:08.599
I'll tell Sean that
you're out of town for a while.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.319
Your lunch is here.

17:21.319 --> 17:25.319
Did you get any of those tests back
yet on that little tennis player?

17:25.960 --> 17:28.520
Manana. She's pretty depressed,
isn't she?

17:28.520 --> 17:31.160
Yeah. I'll meet with her again
tomorrow and play some games

17:31.160 --> 17:33.520
and things like that
and see if I can learn anything

17:33.520 --> 17:35.600
about this pressure she's under.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.440
See you.

17:36.440 --> 17:40.440
See you.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.000
Did you get the juice?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.640
What do you think this is,
my laundry?

17:45.640 --> 17:48.120
I was getting worried,
it's time for the grand opening.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.680
They were out of grapefruit
and OJ was to expensive.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.280
As long as it's something
with sugar in it.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.760
Raspberry lime delight?

17:54.760 --> 17:55.920
Yeah, it was on sale.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.560
I bet. Where's my change?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.680
Oh, here. Here is a receipt.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.640
I also got some gum.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.040
It's time.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.040
I'm so excited(!)

18:10.560 --> 18:12.880
Is my watch fast?

18:12.880 --> 18:15.320
Shirley, you're on a one-way
ticket to disappointment.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.520
Don't be so negative.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.400
There are certain factors
at work here.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.480
They're doing this
at every hospital in Boston.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.040
People aren't going to tune in
their radios to hear about

18:23.040 --> 18:24.600
a major snow alert and say,

18:24.600 --> 18:27.280
"Wow, let's hop in the Volks
and go donate some blood."

18:27.280 --> 18:30.160
You're right, so we're going
to have to be extra clever.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.040
We have got to think of a publicity
stunt to bring people here.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.120
What, shoot someone
out of a cannon?

18:35.120 --> 18:38.160
No, we'd never find a man of that
calibre. We need something else.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.360
It doesn't matter what you do,
it'll be a disaster.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.240
It is like sucking blood
from a stone.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.240
Or from a neck!

18:46.400 --> 18:48.720
This stuff tastes terrible!

18:48.720 --> 18:52.720
Ugh!

18:52.720 --> 18:54.720
'I noticed that you didn't
speak to him...'

18:54.720 --> 18:55.760
How are you doing?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.040
Are they asleep?

18:57.040 --> 19:00.960
Well, Timothy went right out, but it
took Megan four Once Upon A Times.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.120
That's that actor you like,
the English guy.

19:04.120 --> 19:08.120
You know? Don't you?

19:08.720 --> 19:11.000
Well, I can see you're still upset.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.520
Wouldn't you be?

19:12.520 --> 19:15.240
I'm not exactly thrilled
about this either, Myra.

19:15.240 --> 19:18.600
But you are sticking with it because
it's unprofessional to back out.

19:18.600 --> 19:19.840
I'm the guy's doctor.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.840
Well, there are a lot of other
doctors, does it have to be you?

19:24.280 --> 19:27.680
Peter, this scares me to death.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.360
Everything's going so great now.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.840
We're on the way back.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.800
Are you willing to jeopardise that?

19:33.800 --> 19:37.800
Myra, to date not one single doctor
or nurse has ever contracted AIDS
from a patient. The odds are...

19:38.480 --> 19:41.320
There's always a first time.
Suppose it's you.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.800
Is anyone at St Allegis
an expert on this?

19:43.800 --> 19:44.840
What?

19:44.840 --> 19:46.960
I read the magazines, Peter, I know.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.960
If the experts are frantic,
how do you expect me to feel?

19:56.720 --> 20:00.720
They say it's going to snow
tomorrow.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.640
I just thought
it would make more sense

20:06.640 --> 20:10.320
if you assign somebody else
to Mr Markell's case.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.400
Can I ask you why?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.800
I just don't think
I can deal with treating AIDS.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.160
You've been talking with Myra.

20:17.160 --> 20:21.160
In a way. But my coming to
talk to you, that's my decision.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.080
How are things at home, Peter?

20:24.080 --> 20:27.800
Good. Good, I feel like we're
on our way back, me and Myra.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.960
I don't want to mess that up.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.840
I appreciate your candour.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.320
Well, you supported me
when I was having a bad time,

20:35.320 --> 20:37.640
and that's why I hate doing this.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.280
That's all right, I'll get
a resident to take your place.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.720
One without a wife and kids.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.320
Am I interrupting?

20:43.320 --> 20:45.200
No, we're through.

20:45.200 --> 20:49.200
Thanks.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.880
Is it true we have
an AIDS patient downstairs?

20:52.880 --> 20:54.160
Where did you hear that?

20:54.160 --> 20:56.280
Well, that's irrelevant.
Is it true?

20:56.280 --> 20:57.640
Yes.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.920
Well, this is going to kill us
at City Hall.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.240
If the public finds out,
forget about it.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.240
Is there any way we can sort of
slide him into a private hospital?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.960
Joan, it's Tony Gifford.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.240
Are you serious?

21:12.240 --> 21:14.000
And frankly I don't get it.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.800
Now, he admits to an occasional
extramarital fling...

21:16.800 --> 21:20.800
It doesn't make any sense, I thought
most AIDS victims were homosexuals.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.360
Either Tony Gifford defies
all the categories,

21:24.360 --> 21:26.480
in which case CDC
should get involved...

21:26.480 --> 21:29.240
Or else he is lying.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.160
We need to find out.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.440
Now, maybe you can draw him
out on this, Joan.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.160
Sometimes a friend can do
a lot more than the doctor.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.200
Where is he?

21:38.200 --> 21:41.120
Isolation Ward.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.840
Yeah, I'll go talk to him.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.840
Tony is one of the most scrupulous
people in public life.

21:48.040 --> 21:52.040
If this is true, he'll say so.

21:56.320 --> 22:00.320
The oldest fairy in the kingdom
came to the ball uninvited

22:01.960 --> 22:04.240
and she laid a spell
on a little kid.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.720
That's ridiculous.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.360
Fairytales are for children.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.360
All right, OK. I'll tell you what.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.480
Now, we have to have a name for her.
What's a good name for her?

22:17.760 --> 22:19.720
It's your doll, Dr Ridley.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.520
OK.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.640
I think a perfect name is Matilda.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.560
I never heard of anyone
named Matilda.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.920
That is one of the great things
about making things up.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.560
All right? Now, Matilda
is upstairs in her room,

22:33.560 --> 22:35.200
fast asleep.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.960
And she's not going to get up.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.800
And look what time it is,
it's almost lunchtime.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.160
Now, how are we going
to get this kid up?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.680
I don't know.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.480
(WHISTLES)

22:45.480 --> 22:48.320
Hey, Matilda.
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

22:48.320 --> 22:51.200
If Melissa and I tell you a story,
will you get up?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.720
What do you say?

22:52.720 --> 22:54.360
Believe me, she said yes.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.360
All right, come here, we're going to
tell her a story together.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.080
Now, we're going to tell her
a story, all right?

23:03.080 --> 23:07.080
We're going to make it a real
good one. All right, you go first.

23:08.360 --> 23:12.360
Um... Once upon a time...

23:13.400 --> 23:15.840
..there was a...princess.

23:15.840 --> 23:18.440
Fabulous choice. OK.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.440
Who was the most talented
and the most graceful...

23:24.480 --> 23:25.480
Dancer.

23:25.480 --> 23:29.040
Dancer.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.320
She was...

23:31.320 --> 23:33.240
She was a great dancer.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.920
She was the best.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.720
All right, now, she is the best
dancer in the whole world,

23:38.720 --> 23:42.280
but something is bothering her,
something is on her mind.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.480
What was that?

23:45.480 --> 23:49.480
Your turn.

23:51.440 --> 23:55.440
A very important recital
was coming up.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.680
And...

23:57.680 --> 24:00.200
The princess was
starting to get upset.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.200
She did everything they wanted,
there was only one problem.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
She always knew
they'd be disappointed.

24:10.560 --> 24:14.560
That's a pretty
interesting problem.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.080
KNOCKING

24:19.080 --> 24:21.440
Michael, can I see you for a minute?

24:21.440 --> 24:25.440
Excuse me a minute.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.760
I thought you might be
interested in seeing this.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.000
The blood tests indicate that
she's apparently been receiving

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
small doses of anabolic steroids.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.240
You mean bodybuilding pills?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.880
Uh-huh.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.880
OK, well, I'll talk to her father.
OK?

24:51.800 --> 24:54.040
Who told you?

24:54.040 --> 24:56.040
Westphall.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.640
What ever happened to the sanctity
of a doctor-patient relationship?

24:59.640 --> 25:03.640
He thought telling me might help.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.160
Is there anything I can do?

25:05.160 --> 25:09.160
Yeah, you can call Sandra
and talk some sense into her!

25:09.280 --> 25:13.280
I know, I'm just trying
to hold it together.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.800
I keep thinking of all your work
in housing, the MTA reforms,

25:21.120 --> 25:22.880
the health code.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.800
And when it gets out
that I have AIDS...

25:24.800 --> 25:28.240
But you're a popular figure.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.240
If you went public,

25:30.240 --> 25:34.240
you could have Boston coming up
with new funding for AIDS research.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.320
This doesn't necessarily
have to hurt your career.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.400
Get off it, Joan.
What are you talking about?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.520
This is not a speeding ticket!

25:43.520 --> 25:47.520
What good is a career
once you're dead?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.000
I always thought you had guts.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.880
To me, you were one
of the few people who did.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.840
Get off my back, Joan.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.240
Don't you see?

25:59.240 --> 26:02.520
If you come forward,
it will help people.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.080
But you've got to be truly honest.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.080
Oh, you want honesty?

26:15.720 --> 26:19.720
If you want the truth, it was men.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.720
It was men.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.720
I never even knew their names.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.360
Did we get enough?

26:40.360 --> 26:41.520
Ehrlich!

26:41.520 --> 26:45.080
He's the only donor we've had
in half an hour, why don't we
take another pint?

26:45.080 --> 26:46.440
Feeling dizzy, Vijay?

26:46.440 --> 26:47.480
Very little.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.880
Victor, get him some juice.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.760
OK.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.280
Well, where is everyone?

26:55.280 --> 26:58.040
Dr Craig, this is an honour.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.960
Did you do those posters out there?

26:59.960 --> 27:03.080
Those? Yeah. They're big,
aren't they?

27:03.080 --> 27:07.080
They aren't even lettered straight.
I did better than that
when I ran for class treasurer.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.440
Really? Did you win?

27:09.440 --> 27:11.000
There was fraud at the polls.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.520
It took me two years to get
the record set straight.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.880
Oh, boy, that's a shame.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.160
OK, I don't have all day.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.280
We'll be right with you.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.560
Help me out here, Shirley.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.600
Is that for me?

27:22.600 --> 27:25.040
Oh, yes, it is. It's very good, too.
Let me open it for you.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.480
See? Got my hands full.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.920
Go take care of Craig.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.920
Shirley, come on.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.560
What if I can't find a vein?
What if I hit an artery by mistake?

27:32.560 --> 27:34.200
Today, Ehrlich!

27:34.200 --> 27:38.200
OK!

27:39.840 --> 27:43.280
Save that one for yourself.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.320
How many donors have you had?

27:45.320 --> 27:49.320
Oh, we've had about...four.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.720
If I ran the Department of Surgery
like this blood drive,

27:52.720 --> 27:55.360
all our anaesthesiologists
would be out of a job.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.840
(COUGHS)

27:58.840 --> 28:02.840
And guess who'd be
the first one to go.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.720
OK, now, make a fist.

28:05.720 --> 28:09.360
This isn't Ellis Island, Ehrlich,
I know what to do.

28:09.360 --> 28:13.360
Even if you don't.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.960
I think they found a way
to liquefy cardboard.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.440
So how do you end up here in Boston?

28:23.440 --> 28:26.760
Frankly? I got bored.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.640
With North Carolina?

28:28.640 --> 28:29.920
Success.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.560
I guess that depends on
if you've had any.

28:32.560 --> 28:33.760
You know, it's funny.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.680
It seems to me that the biggest
danger you face isn't disease

28:36.680 --> 28:40.680
or malpractice, it's complacency.

28:41.240 --> 28:45.200
If your talent lies in a hot field,
like plastic surgery,

28:45.200 --> 28:49.200
success...it comes very fast.

28:49.480 --> 28:53.480
And it's really tempting to just
sit back and rest on your laurels.

28:55.280 --> 28:59.280
So, I just figured
a change of scene wouldn't hurt.

29:01.080 --> 29:04.120
Besides, my family
lives down in Harwich.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.120
And that's how Bobby Caldwell
came to the land of baked beans.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
Jack?

29:11.200 --> 29:12.640
You got a minute?

29:12.640 --> 29:13.960
I'm out of here.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.200
Have a nice night.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.680
Take good care of Pete.

29:17.680 --> 29:21.680
I meant the baby.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.680
Have you ever seen me do this?

29:28.400 --> 29:32.400
Hey! You ought to join the circus.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.520
Hey, have you talked
to Westphall lately?

29:35.520 --> 29:36.800
No, why?

29:36.800 --> 29:39.680
I was wondering if maybe
he'd mentioned me or anything.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.200
Why should he?

29:41.200 --> 29:43.200
About dropping that case.

29:43.200 --> 29:46.000
I don't want that to hurt
my standing around here.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
OK, you got a bum roll of the dice
and you got a little nervous.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.920
Wouldn't you?

29:52.920 --> 29:55.680
Maybe. But I wouldn't have dropped
a patient like a leper.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.720
Look, I've got a wife
and kids at home, remember?

29:58.720 --> 30:01.280
Yeah, I remember.

30:01.280 --> 30:05.280
Peter, being scared is one thing,
being stupid is another.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.720
Forget about your career,
we're talking ethics here.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.720
You blabbed about the guy in public,
you violated his trust.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.560
You blew it.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.600
I know, I know. OK?

30:16.600 --> 30:19.560
But, Jack, don't beat me up
too much about this,

30:19.560 --> 30:23.560
I mean, I feel bad enough as it is.

30:35.880 --> 30:39.880
Why don't you come to the house
tomorrow night for dinner?
Catherine makes a superb fettuccine.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.920
You've got a deal.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.000
I liked your book
on teenage neurosis.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.080
Really? You're one of
the three people who bought it.

30:47.080 --> 30:50.280
Actually, I borrowed it
from the library.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.600
I thought the chapter on Alice
In Wonderland was particularly good.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.120
Especially the symbolic fall
down the rabbit hole.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.160
Excuse me, Doctor.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.200
Who are you?

30:59.200 --> 31:00.600
Luther.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.040
Why are you decked out like that?

31:02.040 --> 31:04.040
Why are you decked out like that?

31:04.040 --> 31:07.040
Lunch trays, garbage,
I'm playing it safe.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.440
What are you talking about?

31:08.440 --> 31:11.720
My job is tough enough,
but at least I had an outside life.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.720
As soon as the girls hear about
AIDS, my social life is history.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.840
Jenny, where you?
We need every pair of hands here.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.840
Bronchitis?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.040
Well, you sound fine to me.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.120
All right, get back
as soon as you can.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.880
They're dropping like flies.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.440
Hi there.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.560
We understand Councilman Anthony
Gifford is a patient here.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.520
Really?

31:36.520 --> 31:37.560
Really?

31:37.560 --> 31:39.120
Can you confirm this?

31:39.120 --> 31:41.800
Patient information
is strictly classified, sorry.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.160
Well, I understand that.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.920
After all, we all
have to make a living.

31:45.920 --> 31:46.960
Tell me, nurse...

31:46.960 --> 31:48.240
Now, you tell me, buddy,

31:48.240 --> 31:51.120
where do you get off sashaying
in here in search of a scoop?

31:51.120 --> 31:54.120
Is this how you earn your press
stripes, bribing hospital personnel?

31:54.120 --> 31:56.160
All right, just relax,
will you? Calm down.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.520
I have the facts straight,
all I need is a confirmation,

31:58.520 --> 31:59.960
no direct quotes.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.160
Oh, that makes me
feel a lot better(!)

32:02.160 --> 32:06.160
You are asking me
to betray confidential information.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.640
Thanks.

32:08.640 --> 32:12.640
You just saved me ten bucks.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.360
Mrs Rosenthal, are you OK?

32:16.360 --> 32:19.240
Yeah, I'm fine, Billie.
Are you all through helping Dr Lyle?

32:19.240 --> 32:22.280
Yes. Can I ask you something?

32:22.280 --> 32:23.720
I'm right here.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.040
I'd like to switch floors.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.240
Why?

32:27.240 --> 32:30.240
Because I don't want to handle
the blood in the Isolation Ward.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.040
I hear he has AIDS.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.040
Billie, changing floors
isn't going to guarantee anything.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.840
AIDS isn't like flu,
you don't get it from breathing.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.880
As far as the blood goes,
we're observing every precaution.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.680
Then why did Dr White quit the case?

32:43.680 --> 32:45.800
I don't know.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.720
Doctors have the luxury of switching
assignments, nurses don't.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.640
We're always here.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.760
Look, all I know is
that man down the hall is sick

32:52.760 --> 32:54.720
and everything else comes second.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.920
Besides, I really need your help.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.280
OK.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.920
Thank you. Do me a favour,
cover the desk for a while

33:00.920 --> 33:02.920
while I run down and get a sandwich.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.120
Absolutely.

33:04.120 --> 33:08.120
8:25. I love a regular dinner.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.160
Oh, I've read all this material
you've given me.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.760
It seems there's not a hell
of a lot to look forward to.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.960
Out of 2,300 documented cases
of AIDS,

33:31.960 --> 33:34.920
one third contracted
Kaposi's sarcoma like me.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.920
We can use Interleukin-2,
that would bolster your white cells.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.720
Or interferon therapy.

33:40.720 --> 33:44.320
If that works, you could live
a reasonably normal life.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.800
Yeah, but there's no guarantee
that the Kaposi won't recur.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.360
That's right. &gt;

33:49.360 --> 33:50.680
What is this?

33:50.680 --> 33:54.680
It could be a mutant of existing
viruses or a totally new syndrome.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.120
Something destroys
the body's immune system

33:57.120 --> 33:59.880
and leaves it wide open to infection.

33:59.880 --> 34:03.880
And what are my chances?

34:04.320 --> 34:08.320
The vast majority of AIDS patients
die within two years.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.920
&lt; I'm going home.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.679
At least to see Sean.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.080
Have you ever read Boccaccio?

34:17.080 --> 34:18.360
Not since college.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.360
I found something interesting.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.600
"It was the year 1348 in Florence,
lovely city of Italy,

34:26.600 --> 34:28.800
"when the dreadful plague struck.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.000
"The body was covered
with purple spots,

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
"those harbingers of death,
and the inevitable end was this -

34:37.120 --> 34:41.120
"avoid those diseased
and anything they had come near."

34:43.960 --> 34:45.239
You see?

34:45.239 --> 34:47.120
It almost all fits together -

34:47.120 --> 34:50.199
the fainting, the moodiness,

34:50.199 --> 34:53.400
even the traces of acne.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.199
She's such a genuine talent.

34:55.199 --> 34:58.720
She began losing matches
because of her size.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.600
The doses were so small we thought...

35:00.600 --> 35:03.040
Well, that's a blessing, then.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.360
So, all the problems
she has developed

35:05.360 --> 35:08.440
are almost certainly reversible.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.440
I would, however, have your
family doctor keep an eye out

35:12.640 --> 35:14.920
for hormonal changes
or heart disease.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.920
You know, I tell you he had no qualms
about giving her steroids.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.800
Some doctors are just not up on
the latest information

35:23.800 --> 35:27.800
on the drugs that they're
passing out, that's all.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.920
You know...

35:32.920 --> 35:36.920
I also get the sense that she's
missed out on a lot of childhood.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.880
Just...

35:39.880 --> 35:43.880
Just the basics - you know,
free time, a normal fantasy life,

35:45.160 --> 35:49.160
an opportunity maybe to
play with some of her friends.

35:49.840 --> 35:53.080
Yes, I suppose she has.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.200
God knows I've pushed her.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.560
Mr Greely,

35:57.560 --> 36:01.560
I want this child off all steroids.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.720
All set?

36:04.720 --> 36:08.720
Got everything.

36:09.560 --> 36:13.560
I just want you to know
that Matilda finally got up.

36:13.560 --> 36:17.560
That's wonderful news.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.680
I thought you'd like to know
that as far as this hospital

37:43.680 --> 37:47.560
is concerned,
your name will be protected.

37:47.560 --> 37:51.560
Well, I guess that puts
the ball back in my court.

38:05.600 --> 38:09.440
This is him.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.600
Councilman, excuse us, can you
give us a comment of some kind?

38:12.600 --> 38:15.280
Why are you here at St Allegis,
Mr Gifford? Is it cancer?

38:15.280 --> 38:17.400
Will you confirm
or deny the rumours?

38:17.400 --> 38:20.800
We appreciate the fact you probably
don't feel well, but anything at all.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.880
A small statement.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.960
Yeah.

38:22.960 --> 38:23.560
Help us out a little bit, will you?

38:23.560 --> 38:27.560
Help us out a little bit, will you?

38:29.120 --> 38:33.120
Let's find the stairs.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.720
Can you believe this? &gt;

38:38.720 --> 38:41.600
You put up a poster,
someone mucks it up.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.440
No wonder the blood drive's
a fiasco.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.440
Sometimes I think medicine's
a lost cause.

38:47.440 --> 38:51.440
I don't suppose you'd like
to give blood?

39:03.320 --> 39:04.560
Annie.

39:04.560 --> 39:05.840
How's it going, Peter?

39:05.840 --> 39:09.040
All right. Listen, did Westphall
say anything to you about me

39:09.040 --> 39:10.280
and the AIDS case?

39:10.280 --> 39:13.320
Just that you were worried
about your wife and kids.

39:13.320 --> 39:16.480
Oh. Well, how's he doing?

39:16.480 --> 39:17.720
Gifford.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.000
You're right on top of things,
aren't you?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.560
He checked out this afternoon.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.960
I guess I did kind of panic,
didn't I?

39:23.960 --> 39:27.960
But didn't it bother you
working on the case?

39:28.160 --> 39:29.800
Sure it bothered me.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.680
Just like working on someone
with Guillain-Barre,
pneumonia or hepatitis.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.600
The difference is
nobody knows how you get AIDS.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.600
Look, every generation has a disease
that freaks them out -

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
smallpox, polio, TB.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.120
The panic is often as big a problem
as the disease itself.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.640
Come on, Annie, this is different.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.440
It's kind of a moot point as far
as you are concerned, isn't it?

39:50.440 --> 39:54.440
I mean, he's gone.
You're off the hook.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.160
Come on, come on.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.720
No way! N-O way.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.720
Whatever happened to volunteerism?

40:04.720 --> 40:06.920
Look, guys, charity begins at home,
right?

40:06.920 --> 40:08.600
Well, just think of St Allegis
as home.

40:08.600 --> 40:12.480
Get this straight, Florence
Nightingale, I'm not giving blood,
I'm not getting blood,

40:12.480 --> 40:15.200
I'm not even handling blood
until Mr AIDS is out of here.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.280
And I'm not the only one.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.320
And I'm not the only one.

40:17.320 --> 40:21.240
Luther, we bagged 28 pints in seven
hours, that's not even pathetic.

40:21.240 --> 40:22.520
Do it for me.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.800
For you?

40:23.800 --> 40:26.680
Look, the only needle I want to see
is on my stereo, at home,

40:26.680 --> 40:28.480
which is where I'm headed.

40:28.480 --> 40:30.440
Take comfort.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.640
Believe it or not,
all of this is in the Book Of Job.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.720
Hey, amigos, what's going on?

40:35.720 --> 40:37.680
Ehrlich, this is a desperate woman.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.000
Has anyone shown up?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.120
By comparison,
the morgue is happening.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.640
Save the jokes.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.400
You know, physicians
should believe in blood drives.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.720
You drive me wild
when you get ethical, Shirl.

40:47.720 --> 40:49.240
I guess you can't win 'em all.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.840
Forget about my blood,
I had hep in '81.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.720
You guys... I mean,
you're supposed to be doctors.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.960
It takes everything we've got
just to stay in place around here.

40:57.960 --> 41:01.960
I'm not even talking about making
strides. But you do nothing to help.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.840
You moan, you drag your feet,
you get in the way.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.920
I had an opportunity, as a nurse,

41:06.920 --> 41:10.160
to push something I really
believe in, this blood drive.

41:10.160 --> 41:14.160
And, frankly, I am sick and tired
of carrying the whole damn ball
on my own.

41:14.240 --> 41:18.240
You're right.
Ehrlich, you're a pig.

41:19.720 --> 41:23.720
OK, let's go.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.040
Take my blood, please.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.200
Victor, I appreciate
the noble gesture.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.200
Well, you didn't ask to work with me
in this thing, you got me by default.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.160
I guess it's guilt-trip time.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.880
Think of my O positive
as an emblem of my apology.

41:41.880 --> 41:43.640
That's poetry.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.440
I accept.

41:46.440 --> 41:49.080
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.000
That's a new needle, isn't it?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.920
Don't worry, you can't get
AIDS from donating blood.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.120
Oh, boy!

41:55.120 --> 41:57.800
It's times like this
I wish I had a camera.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.040
OK, think surf, yeah.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.760
Big blue header, yeah.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.000
Tuck into the curl.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.760
What's he talking about?

42:05.760 --> 42:09.320
Sand, great day, no crowds,
cold beer. Ride that sucker
all the way to Malibu.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.840
Boy, boy, boy.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.000
Torrey Pines, Rincon, Pismo Beach.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.280
Uh-oh. Early withdrawal alert.

42:15.280 --> 42:17.720
Victor, do you always
turn this pale?

42:17.720 --> 42:20.520
OK, offshore breeze.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.800
Gnarly waves, perfect tan.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.600
Oh, no, Shirley, it's no good,
I'm going to be sick, babe.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.080
OK, we'll call a halt.
Just hold on a second.

42:28.080 --> 42:32.080
Fiscus, get a cold cloth, quick!

42:32.720 --> 42:35.400
I didn't even get a chance
to yell "timber".

42:35.400 --> 42:36.440
I'll put it this way,

42:36.440 --> 42:39.360
if the roof had fallen in today,
it would have been a blessing.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.040
Yeah, I know what you mean.

42:42.040 --> 42:45.440
Blood drive, AIDS rumours,
graffiti in the elevator.

42:45.440 --> 42:48.400
Don't you two ever go home?
It's almost 11.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.760
You mean today
is finally going to end?

42:50.760 --> 42:53.720
You know, I don't now,
maybe it is just pre-Christmas blues,

42:53.720 --> 42:56.400
but I feel like I'm 100-years-old.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.400
Well, if it's any consolation at
all, Helen, remember that both Mark
and I have several yearson you.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.280
Speak for yourself.

43:04.280 --> 43:07.600
You know? I keep coming back
to Tony Gifford.

43:07.600 --> 43:08.920
He is a young man.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.160
What'll happen to him
in the time he has left?

43:12.160 --> 43:15.600
I don't know, maybe he should've
thought about that sooner.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.480
Yeah, I know, that's how
I felt about it at first.

43:18.480 --> 43:22.360
And then I started to think,
"Who am I?"

43:22.360 --> 43:24.720
Why should any of us
be penalised, fatally,

43:24.720 --> 43:26.560
for choosing a certain lifestyle?

43:26.560 --> 43:30.280
Especially when you realise it
all boils down to chance anyway.

43:30.280 --> 43:33.800
I tell you something, I don't
give a damn for all this talk about

43:33.800 --> 43:36.120
morality and vengeful gods
and all that.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.600
If you have AIDS,
you're sick, you need help.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.760
And that's all that matters.
And that's why we are here, right?

43:41.760 --> 43:44.960
OK, come on,
I'll treat you to a Triple B.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.160
What?

43:46.160 --> 43:48.720
BBB. Beat the Blues Bourbon.

43:48.720 --> 43:52.720
For a minute you scared me.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.280
'US Marines departed
the island of Granada today.

43:59.280 --> 44:03.120
'Replacements are scheduled to reach
Granada on Friday.

44:03.120 --> 44:05.440
'In local news, the holiday week
was eclipsed by

44:05.440 --> 44:08.800
'one of the most startling
announcements of this
or any political year

44:08.800 --> 44:12.400
'when Councilman Anthony Gifford,
34, released a statement tonight

44:12.400 --> 44:15.760
'saying that he has contracted
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,

44:15.760 --> 44:19.400
'or AIDS. He also announced that
he would not resign from office.'

44:19.400 --> 44:20.800
Let's go get that drink.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.400
Merry Christmas, you guys.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.400
'...to scattered demands
for Gifford's resignation.'
