most of last week.

if we were saying something

05:54.954 --> 05:57.656
- Do you want me to start

05:54.954 --> 05:57.656
talking or what?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.292
- Start talking.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.292
- Okay.

05:59.324 --> 06:00.726
So you know how Chase

05:59.324 --> 06:00.726
is not supposed

06:00.759 --> 06:03.163
to have food in his room

06:00.759 --> 06:03.163
and shoes on the carpet?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.130
- Uh-huh.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.130
- He has shoes on the carpet,

06:05.165 --> 06:07.399
and he has food in his room.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.769
- In this house?

06:07.434 --> 06:09.769
- Yes.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.237
- Any dirt on the others?

06:09.802 --> 06:12.237
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:12.271 --> 06:13.473
- About who?

06:13.505 --> 06:16.141
- It's a secret about Mom.

06:13.505 --> 06:16.141
- Oh, really?

06:16.175 --> 06:20.279
So is this a chocolate syrup

06:16.175 --> 06:20.279
kinda secret?

06:20.312 --> 06:22.281
- Yes.

06:20.312 --> 06:22.281
- It is?

06:22.314 --> 06:25.185
- I'd like

06:22.314 --> 06:25.185
a heavy-handed pour, sir.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.887
I learned that from Nanny.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.355
- Cherries?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.355
- Yes.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.423
- One or two?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.423
- Five.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.793
- You better have

06:32.625 --> 06:34.793
some good information.

06:34.827 --> 06:35.795
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.230
- Whipped cream?

06:35.829 --> 06:38.230
- Yes.

06:38.264 --> 06:39.298
- Start talking.

06:39.331 --> 06:41.701
- Mom has a surprise

06:39.331 --> 06:41.701
planned for you.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.502
- For me?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.502
- Yeah.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.720
- What is it?

06:43.536 --> 06:46.720
- Keep spraying.

06:46.105 --> 06:49.209
- Mom wants to take you

06:46.105 --> 06:49.209
to a fancy dinner on Friday.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.744
- Okay.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.744
For me and her?

06:50.776 --> 06:53.812
- Yeah.

06:50.776 --> 06:53.812
- Eat up.

06:53.846 --> 06:57.182
Yeah, it's gonna be a good

06:53.846 --> 06:57.182
night for your old man here.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.586
You keep this thing

06:57.216 --> 06:59.586
going with me and you,

06:59.619 --> 07:03.589
and you got a lot of ice cream

06:59.619 --> 07:03.589

07:03.622 --> 07:05.290
Now, when it comes time

07:03.622 --> 07:05.290
for dinner,

07:05.324 --> 07:06.892
you've still gotta

07:05.324 --> 07:06.892
eat your dinner.

07:06.925 --> 07:08.261
- Mm-hmm.

07:08.293 --> 07:10.497
- 'Cause if not, then

07:08.293 --> 07:10.497
she's gonna know everything.

- We're not eating these.

are you, Faye?

08:01.648 --> 08:06.189
- Now, Harvey, if you come

08:01.648 --> 08:06.189
into our house to play poker,

08:06.189 --> 08:08.209
now, we're coming

raise it $500 more.

- I just like a smart ass.

08:26.372 --> 08:27.740

beef with Papa Harvey,

08:29.908 --> 08:31.644
and of course

08:29.908 --> 08:31.644
I'm caught in the middle of it.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.746
- Well, you did choose

08:31.677 --> 08:33.746
Papa Harvey over her.

08:33.779 --> 08:35.115
- That's not what I did,

Savannah.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.500
- That's exactly what you did.

- I'm with her

08:37.830 --> 08:39.619
every single week.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.889
- So it's a routine for her,

08:39.652 --> 08:42.889
and you messed it up.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.657
It's like how I feel

when Dad and I

08:44.691 --> 08:47.559
are supposed to go to lunch

08:44.691 --> 08:47.559
and then he invites you.

happens, so...

- You have nothing.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.703
You literally have nothing.

08:57.736 --> 08:59.773
- Well, the bluff didn't work,

08:57.736 --> 08:59.773
I guess.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.341

good chicken wings.

- Chase learned how to eat

09:39.611 --> 09:41.347
wings from Papa Harvey.

09:41.380 --> 09:44.500
Remember, we'd always go

09:41.380 --> 09:44.500
to Wingstop after school,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.519
and the way Papa Harvey

09:44.500 --> 09:46.519
would eat wings...

09:46.860 --> 09:47.821
- He would, like, moan

09:46.860 --> 09:47.821
while he did it.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.822
I was like...

09:49.855 --> 09:52.959
Like, "What are you doing?"

09:49.855 --> 09:52.959
But speaking of Papa,

09:53.590 --> 09:54.927
what's going on

09:53.590 --> 09:54.927
with him and Nanny?

09:54.961 --> 09:56.895
Because I invited him

09:54.961 --> 09:56.895
to our poker night,

09:56.929 --> 09:59.264
and she was acting

09:56.929 --> 09:59.264
super weird towards him.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.467
- I mean, I personally

09:59.298 --> 10:01.467
can understand that

10:01.500 --> 10:03.302
because Harvey is a lot.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.571
- Well, you've

10:03.336 --> 10:04.571
finally done it.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.405
Your dislike of my daddy

10:22.956 --> 10:24.557

- Julie, honey,

10:24.591 --> 10:26.793

All right, try that wing.

Hold up.

And I understand why

15:57.899 --> 16:00.125
you would have held on to that.

16:00.159 --> 16:03.289
Because if someone said,

16:00.159 --> 16:03.289
basically, that Chase

16:03.289 --> 16:05.309
was not good enough

16:03.289 --> 16:05.309
for their daughter,

16:05.649 --> 16:06.865
then that would offend me

I love him too.

16:14.740 --> 16:15.207
All you had to do

16:15.240 --> 16:16.442

16:43.702 --> 16:45.705
I won't ever say another word.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.140
- I mean, the fact that Faye

16:45.739 --> 16:48.140

16:48.173 --> 16:50.576
to this for 25 years...

I mean, life's too short

You gotta let go,

16:53.245 --> 16:55.881

17:51.136 --> 17:52.971
- Well, thank you so much

17:51.136 --> 17:52.971
for bringing it.

17:53.730 --> 17:54.473
- Of course.

17:53.730 --> 17:54.473
- How's it going?

17:54.507 --> 17:55.775
- It's going good.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.644
You know, the girls

17:55.808 --> 17:57.644
had such a great time.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.278
But, you know,

17:57.676 --> 17:59.278
it was so funny.

17:59.311 --> 18:02.214
Chloe was, like,

17:59.311 --> 18:02.214
really interested in our house,

18:02.248 --> 18:04.170
like, the square footage,

18:04.170 --> 18:06.618
when was the last time

18:04.170 --> 18:06.618
we did renovations...

18:06.653 --> 18:08.887
I was just like...

18:06.653 --> 18:08.887
- Oh, my gosh.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.250
- "Either you're, like,

18:08.922 --> 18:12.250
an interior designer, or..."

18:12.250 --> 18:14.928
You're really--

18:12.250 --> 18:14.928
- Well, I am so sorry.

18:15.279 --> 18:17.262
Listen, I know

18:15.279 --> 18:17.262
she had a great time.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.465
So next time,

18:17.297 --> 18:19.465
we'll do the playdate.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.767
- Okay.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.767
Thank you so much.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.368
- Thanks for bringing

18:20.799 --> 18:22.368
the jacket.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.869
- Yes.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.869
- See you. Drive safe.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.472
- Okay. Bye.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.472
- She was so nice.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.906
- Yeah, she was so nice.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.309
But Chloe asking questions

18:27.941 --> 18:30.309
about this woman's house?

18:30.343 --> 18:31.577
- Well, maybe she

18:30.343 --> 18:31.577
just wanted to know

18:31.611 --> 18:32.778
how large the house was.

18:32.811 --> 18:33.913
- Savannah.

18:32.811 --> 18:33.913
- You know, in comparison.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.181
- Savannah.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.715
I was born at night,

18:35.214 --> 18:36.715
but it wasn't last night.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.952
- Well, I'm just saying.

18:40.529 --> 18:41.954
What? Why are you looking

18:40.529 --> 18:41.954
at me like that?

18:42.549 --> 18:43.655
- You went with your dad

18:42.549 --> 18:43.655
to drop her off.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.259
What was said?

18:46.291 --> 18:49.619
- Long story short, he told

18:46.291 --> 18:49.619
Chloe he'd get her a bike

18:49.619 --> 18:51.970
if she got some information

18:49.619 --> 18:51.970
about this house for him.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.365
- What?

18:52.398 --> 18:53.700
- But you can't say that

18:52.398 --> 18:53.700
you heard this from me,

18:53.732 --> 18:55.902
because I gotta get

18:53.732 --> 18:55.902
my pair of shoes first,

18:55.934 --> 18:57.302
and then you can tell him

18:55.934 --> 18:57.302
that you heard it from me.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.438
- What are you talking about

18:57.336 --> 18:58.438
a pair of shoes?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.772
- Well, because he told me

18:59.806 --> 19:01.106
he'd buy me a pair of shoes

18:59.806 --> 19:01.106
if I kept my mouth shut.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.143
- Okay, Savannah, this is wrong

19:01.141 --> 19:03.143
on every level.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.144
- Now, remember,

19:03.175 --> 19:05.144
you're not gonna say anything

19:05.178 --> 19:07.346
to Daddy, right, until what?

19:13.586 --> 19:14.520
<i>[classical music]</i>

19:15.422 --> 19:17.790
- There's a method

19:15.422 --> 19:17.790
to my madness, darling.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.226
You can see the front of the

19:17.824 --> 19:20.226
shoe and the back of the shoe

19:20.259 --> 19:21.627
so that, when she comes

19:20.259 --> 19:21.627
in here,

19:21.661 --> 19:24.396
she knows exactly what

19:21.661 --> 19:24.396
kinda heel she's looking for.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.132
Now, let me explain this

19:24.431 --> 19:26.132
to you.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.269
This is very important.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.269
Do you know what this is?

19:29.301 --> 19:31.270
- Heels.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.270
- It's a work of art.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.605
It's Valentino.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.941
- Who's Valentino?

19:32.638 --> 19:34.941
- You take care of Valentino,

19:35.410 --> 19:37.277
Valentino takes care of you.

19:35.410 --> 19:37.277
You feel me?

19:37.309 --> 19:38.411
- Mm-hmm.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.411
- Okay.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.413
- Oh, my gosh,

19:38.444 --> 19:40.413
this looks so good.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.847
It's starting to come together.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.883
I mean, I love

19:41.881 --> 19:43.883
an organized closet,

19:43.916 --> 19:46.519
especially when I'm not the one

19:43.916 --> 19:46.519
having to organize it.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.954
- Yeah, yeah, lap it up.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.954
I bet you're just loving this.

19:49.549 --> 19:50.256
- I am, actually,

19:50.289 --> 19:52.925
because listen,

19:50.289 --> 19:52.925
she's not a realtor.

19:52.959 --> 19:53.926
She's eight.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.729
- Yeah.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.729
- And if you ever become

19:55.761 --> 19:57.329
a real estate agent,

19:57.364 --> 20:00.000
at that point when you go

19:57.364 --> 20:00.000
for a listing appointment,

20:00.329 --> 20:01.567
you can ask those questions.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.536
But your dad getting

20:01.601 --> 20:03.536
free information--oh, no, no,

20:03.569 --> 20:05.538
no, not free information.

20:05.571 --> 20:09.275
I believe there was

20:05.571 --> 20:09.275
a little bit of a...

20:09.308 --> 20:10.676
new bike maybe.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.444
- Um...

20:12.479 --> 20:14.948
- We were gonna have to buy

20:12.479 --> 20:14.948
a new bike anyway.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.182
I was just knocking

20:14.980 --> 20:17.182
that out of the way.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.651
- Yep.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.651
- New shoes?

20:18.684 --> 20:22.422
- So Savannah told you

20:18.684 --> 20:22.422
about shoes?

20:22.454 --> 20:24.990
That heifer won't get none.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.990
She'll walk barefooted.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.726
- Between you messing up

20:25.250 --> 20:26.726
with Chloe

20:26.759 --> 20:29.929
and getting involved

20:26.759 --> 20:29.929
in your mom and my dad,

20:29.962 --> 20:31.698
I mean, you've really

20:29.962 --> 20:31.698
outdone yourself.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.329
You're batting a thousand.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.867
- Julie, you wanna get

20:33.660 --> 20:34.867
all pissy about this

20:34.901 --> 20:37.202
when in reality,

20:34.901 --> 20:37.202
you ought to be excited

20:37.237 --> 20:39.720
about how much

20:37.237 --> 20:39.720
Chloe can recall.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.641
I said square footage,

20:39.105 --> 20:41.641
she told me.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.144
Bathrooms remodeled,

20:41.674 --> 20:44.144
she told me.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.644
- That's great.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.644
I wonder if she knows

20:45.679 --> 20:48.140
the square footage

20:45.679 --> 20:48.140
of the doghouse you're in.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.848
- Oh, here we go.

20:49.883 --> 20:53.153
Moving forward I can understand

20:49.883 --> 20:53.153
how you would not want

20:53.185 --> 20:57.656
to include Chloe in spying

20:53.185 --> 20:57.656
and bribing and all of that.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.226
And those should be things

20:57.691 --> 21:00.226
that we kinda focus on

21:00.259 --> 21:01.928
as she gets 15 or 16.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.863
both: No.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.863
- Uh-uh.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.632
- Not focus on at all.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.567
Chloe, do you understand

21:05.664 --> 21:07.567
what I'm saying?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.336
- Yes, ma'am.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.336
I understand.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.471
- So I'm glad that

21:09.368 --> 21:11.471
you've learned your lesson.

21:11.503 --> 21:12.939
Now, would you like

21:11.503 --> 21:12.939
to go get some ice cream?

21:12.971 --> 21:14.340
- Yes.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.340
- All right, let's go.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.976
- I love macadamia, but--

21:14.374 --> 21:16.976
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

21:17.769 --> 21:18.944
You need to finish up here

21:17.769 --> 21:18.944
and go ahead and get started

21:18.978 --> 21:20.212
on that color coordinating.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.282
- I'll bring you some macadani.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.282
-Macadani.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.817
- You know what, Valentino?

21:24.851 --> 21:27.453
It's always been me

21:24.851 --> 21:27.453
and you anyway.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.923
You're the only one

21:27.487 --> 21:29.923
that's never traded on me.
