WEBVTT

00:17.600 --> 00:19.226
ANNOUNCER: Clone troopers unite!

00:19.269 --> 00:21.729
As war rages across the galaxy,

00:21.771 --> 00:24.398
the Republic's clone army
strives for victory

00:24.441 --> 00:27.526
against the evil forces of the Separatists.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.070
Bravery, valor, unity,

00:30.113 --> 00:34.116
the lifeblood of victory on the battlefield
and in space.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.452
It all begins on the planet Kamino,

00:36.578 --> 00:40.289
where Jedi General Shaak Ti
oversees the training of clones

00:40.415 --> 00:43.333
with the help of
contracted bounty hunters.

00:43.460 --> 00:47.296
Bred to be perfect soldiers,
these cadets must first be subjected

00:47.422 --> 00:52.134
to intense physical and mental training
before heading off to war.

01:06.941 --> 01:07.983
You're clear! You're clear!

01:09.152 --> 01:10.277
Cover fire!

01:15.533 --> 01:19.995
This is Command. You must break
through enemy lines and take the tower.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.831
-Comlink just relayed orders from...
-We all heard the orders, Echo!

01:22.957 --> 01:26.001
-Stop calling me that.
-Stop repeating every order!

01:26.127 --> 01:28.504
Less yapping, more blasting!

01:31.174 --> 01:34.176
Let's smoke these chrome domes
and move on to the Citadel!

01:34.219 --> 01:37.054
CT-782! You're breaking formation!

01:37.180 --> 01:39.515
Just follow my lead, will you?

01:43.311 --> 01:45.187
He's clearing a path. I'm moving.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.694
Thanks, CT-27-5555. That was close.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.364
It's "Fives"! The name is Fives!

01:56.699 --> 02:00.202
Yeah, five pieces
if you don't keep your head down!

02:00.245 --> 02:03.539
How about we follow orders?
This is our last practice test!

02:03.581 --> 02:07.084
Will you shut up with instructions?
You're not in charge.

02:11.047 --> 02:14.049
This particular unit
seems to have some trouble.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.592
What do you recommend?

02:15.718 --> 02:20.597
Well, I'm no Jedi, so forgive my bluntness,
but I say they fail.

02:20.723 --> 02:25.394
Send them down to maintenance duty
with 99 and the other rejects.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.480
We can't fail them yet.
Remember, this is only a practice test.

02:28.565 --> 02:33.068
And besides, the Citadel course was
constructed to be a difficult challenge.

02:33.111 --> 02:37.990
Although I don't agree with his sentiment,
Bric isn't wrong.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.450
These cadets are far from ready.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.414
I can't hit anything from here.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.833
No! We have to follow orders!

02:49.252 --> 02:53.046
The one they call "Echo"
never adapts to the situation.

02:59.888 --> 03:05.142
CT-782 seems to follow his own path.
He can't do it all alone.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.603
You go, I'll cover you.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.939
-I'm a better shot, you go.
-No, you go!

03:13.943 --> 03:18.113
Look at those two.
Argue on the battlefield, you end up dead.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.282
And the last one.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.873
I surrender. I surrender!

03:27.957 --> 03:29.791
Need I say more?

03:29.876 --> 03:33.545
If these cadets can't get past
their shortsighted selfishness,

03:33.630 --> 03:38.300
they will never come together.
Unity wins war, gentlemen.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.845
Computer, end exercise for Domino Squad.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.975
99, would you please send a cleaning crew
to the training ground?

03:47.060 --> 03:50.229
Yes, mistress, we'll take care of the mess.

03:51.105 --> 03:55.651
You should tell that 99 to drag away
the mess called Domino Squad.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.366
We almost had it this time.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.952
Yeah, and we all look nothing alike either.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.120
Sorry about the mess, 99.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.290
It's okay, boys. Nice try.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.506
So I says to her,
"Baby, you and me could really..."

04:17.590 --> 04:18.966
You've never even met a girl.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.139
You know, you shouldn't worry
because most clones pass.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.142
Yeah, but not all of us, right, shortie?

04:33.481 --> 04:36.358
Guys, we've got to follow orders.
Come on!

04:36.442 --> 04:38.902
I don't know. I think it went rather well.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.445
Quit joking around.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.823
Can we please stop arguing?

04:42.907 --> 04:46.910
Can you stop being droid bait out there?
You're getting in my way.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.996
Actually, our way.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.999
Well, you want to be the best,
then you got to think like it.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.126
And I'm thinking like an ARC trooper.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.712
ARC troopers follow orders.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.006
Care to repeat that, Echo?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.343
Come on, get him, Hevy!
Smack that know-it-all!

05:03.386 --> 05:04.678
Cut it out!

05:04.721 --> 05:09.057
If you two would focus on fighting droids
as much as you do fighting each other,

05:09.183 --> 05:11.226
you might stand a chance out there.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.978
Sorry, Master Chief.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.564
Well, Master Chief,

05:15.690 --> 05:18.066
maybe our problems
come from our training.

05:18.192 --> 05:21.862
I'd rather be taught by a Jedi
than some mercenary bounty hunter.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.699
Jedi don't have the time
to train grunts like you,

05:25.742 --> 05:27.701
that's why they hired me.

05:32.165 --> 05:37.169
Listen, boys, when you were assigned
to me, I had high hopes for you.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.713
Now we're approaching
the end of your training

05:39.756 --> 05:42.591
and you haven't advanced nearly enough.

05:42.675 --> 05:47.554
Even this bad batcher, 99,
has more sense than you guys do,

05:47.597 --> 05:50.182
and he's a maintenance clone!

05:50.266 --> 05:52.601
You... You don't give them enough credit.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.687
You're all a waste of my time.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.785
I understand your concerns, Master Jedi.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.288
Ever since the unfortunate death
of Jango Fett,

06:13.414 --> 06:17.417
we have had to stretch his DNA
to produce more clones.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.962
A Jedi does not feel concern, Lama Su.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.424
However, I have noticed
this unit of clones have been...

06:24.467 --> 06:26.093
Deficient?

06:26.135 --> 06:29.304
My only thought
is for you to search the galaxy

06:29.430 --> 06:33.683
and find a suitable donor
for your future clones.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.815
And what of the clones produced so far?

06:39.941 --> 06:44.277
As you know,
there is no one way to make a clone.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.615
Sometimes our efforts
are less than successful.

06:49.367 --> 06:54.329
Are you suggesting
we just cast off the Domino Squad?

06:54.455 --> 06:57.624
They're living beings, not objects.

06:58.459 --> 07:02.045
You Jedi show too much compassion.

07:02.171 --> 07:06.508
Nevertheless,
as General in charge of training,

07:06.634 --> 07:11.847
the decision on what to do with them
would be yours, Master Jedi.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.029
Gentlemen, who wants
to be an ARC Trooper?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.322
-I do, sir!
-I do, sir!

07:29.365 --> 07:31.783
You have to pass your final test first.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.871
I want you to meet Commander Colt
of the rancor battalion.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.873
I want you troopers to remember,

07:37.957 --> 07:42.669
we're shoulder-to-shoulder
on those front lines. Brothers.

07:42.712 --> 07:47.674
And sometimes we may quarrel,
but no matter what, we are united.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.636
Rule one, we fight together.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.847
So, who's ready to step up first?

07:54.557 --> 07:58.351
Let's start with the unit
that ran the practice test in record time.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.228
ARC trooper time.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.230
Think he means us, boys?

08:02.356 --> 08:03.899
Bravo Unit, step up.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.862
Well, bravo for Bravo Squad.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.406
Show an ARC trooper how it's done.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.080
Come on, boys,
maybe we can learn something.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.082
Shut up, Echo.

08:28.925 --> 08:33.512
COLT: Start the Citadel challenge,
version THX, variable 1138.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.274
CLONE: Go right! Clankers!

08:54.992 --> 08:56.660
We're better than these guys.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.042
Okay, this is it. Go for it!

09:15.930 --> 09:17.305
He's going to make it.

09:28.776 --> 09:33.154
I'm impressed. You trained them well.
Who's next?

09:33.239 --> 09:35.156
The Domino Squad.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.324
(BRIC LAUGHS)

09:36.367 --> 09:38.034
And how are they?

09:41.289 --> 09:45.250
-We can do this, guys.
-All we have to do is follow orders.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.344
Check it out, guys.
Time to watch the Dominos fall.

09:59.515 --> 10:03.435
-They are so much better than us.
-Knock it off.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.397
Begin the program.
Let's not take it easy on them.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.160
They're getting farther than normal.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.746
Maybe so, but they're sloppy.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.664
This is nothing.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.126
Give them their next set of orders
and watch the chaos ensue.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.379
I'm telling you,
these guys just aren't ready.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.636
I flank left, you flank right!

10:38.512 --> 10:42.599
Take it easy, I'm on your side.
Get it, your side, huh?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.935
Pretty unorthodox.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.898
Droid bait, behind you!

10:51.484 --> 10:52.817
Man down!

10:53.569 --> 10:56.279
Forget him! I'm breaking for the Citadel!

11:00.076 --> 11:01.117
Hurry!

11:01.702 --> 11:03.370
Guys, I think he's injured.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.538
Leave him. Come on!

11:08.417 --> 11:10.794
We're gonna pass this time.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.632
Okay, I spoke too soon.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.929
That would be putting it mildly.

11:21.055 --> 11:25.684
Broke formation, disobeyed orders,
and you left a man behind.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.227
You broke rule number one.

11:27.937 --> 11:32.273
I'm sorry, Domino Squad.
This is an automatic failure.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.445
I told you this was going to happen.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.572
We've wasted enough time
on those losers.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.534
Their failure is our failure.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.285
I've made a request to General Shaak Ti

11:44.370 --> 11:47.706
that the Domino Squad be allowed
to repeat the final test.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.749
Why do you care about them?

11:49.792 --> 11:53.461
-Why don't you?
-I care about getting paid.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.881
It's a shame the bounty hunter in you
sees this only as a job.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.300
More like an impossible task.

12:01.721 --> 12:06.099
These cadets will be the finest troopers
we've trained. I have faith in them.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.936
Faith? You can't be serious, El-Les.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.480
We should treat them
as a special challenge, Bric.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.816
We should treat them as failures.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.611
Besides, I've already requested that they
be moved to clean up and maintenance.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.656
That's all they're going to be good for.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.118
Then I guess
the General has a decision to make.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.008
General, may we have a word?

12:40.801 --> 12:44.012
You are here to discuss your squad,
aren't you?

12:44.138 --> 12:46.514
-How did you...
-Jedi, mate.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.436
One doesn't need to be a Jedi
to feel the stress on your mind.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.440
General, we would like to request
a transfer to another squad.

12:55.524 --> 12:57.525
Bravo Squad, perhaps?

12:58.194 --> 13:03.531
I am a Jedi, where the individual
and the group are one and the same,

13:03.616 --> 13:05.450
much like you clones.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.870
Which is why Fives and I
are looking out for each other.

13:08.954 --> 13:12.832
As individuals. But not as a group.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.001
You are where you need to be.

13:15.044 --> 13:20.048
Solve your problems as a whole,
not as individuals.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.301
I have decided to allow you
and the rest of your squad

13:23.385 --> 13:26.054
to take the test again tomorrow.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.698
You wanted to see me, sir?

13:45.741 --> 13:49.911
Near as I can tell,
you're the reason your squad's a failure.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.956
Uh... Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.251
It's all a big joke to you, right?

13:56.335 --> 14:00.672
Like those little nicknames you and
your clone brothers give each other.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.756
(CHUCKLES)

14:01.882 --> 14:04.050
I could think of one for you right now, sir.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.594
Oh... Funny!

14:06.679 --> 14:11.099
But I think it's all just a cover.
You hate me, don't you?

14:11.183 --> 14:15.603
Oh, no. No, no, no.
How could I hate you for doing your job?

14:15.729 --> 14:20.733
-You're just pushing me, sir.
-No, this is me pushing you.

14:20.776 --> 14:25.280
Come on, clone. Hit me. Hit me, you joker.

14:25.364 --> 14:30.034
Can't take anything seriously, can you?
You're a real cutup, aren't you?

14:30.119 --> 14:31.286
Come on!

14:32.955 --> 14:35.456
-Thank you, sir.
-For what?

14:37.543 --> 14:42.881
For my name. "Cutup."
I like the sound of it.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.133
Out of my sight, cadet.

14:45.259 --> 14:49.637
One way or another,
you'll be out of this army. Count on it.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.166
Hevy, you going somewhere?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.001
Get out of here.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.962
You're going AWOL, aren't you?

15:23.005 --> 15:26.507
Just go back to sleep, 99.
This doesn't concern you.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.802
But you can't do this to your squad.

15:29.845 --> 15:34.557
My squad?
We're nothing but a bad batch. Failures.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.352
Like you.

15:37.394 --> 15:43.232
Yeah, but how can I be a failure when I...
I never even got my chance?

15:43.359 --> 15:45.318
It's a chance you're throwing away.

15:46.320 --> 15:51.407
You're always trying to be the anchor,
Hevy, you know, do it on your own.

15:51.533 --> 15:57.372
Well, maybe you should embrace the fact
that you have a team.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.707
See, I never had that.

15:59.750 --> 16:04.212
But you need them, and they need you.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.548
Why carry such a heavy burden
on your own,

16:07.591 --> 16:10.551
when you have your brothers
at your side, Hevy?

16:10.594 --> 16:17.058
Hevy? Stop calling me that!
We're just numbers, 99. Just numbers.

16:17.101 --> 16:22.105
Not to me.
To me, you've always had a name.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.618
Hey, where's CT-782?

16:35.744 --> 16:38.705
Yeah, where is CT-782?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.582
If he is not here, we will fail.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.752
Not today, brothers.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.547
Today, we pass.

16:49.216 --> 16:52.260
And one more thing, the name's Hevy.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.064
Orders came in clear, mates.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.942
-Nothing to repeat, Echo?
-Not today.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.070
-How's that shoulder treating you?
-I'll live.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.115
We all know what we have to do.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.805
That's it, boys, stay together.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.265
Fives, on your left!

17:41.101 --> 17:43.478
-Thanks, Cutup.
-No problem, brother.

17:43.604 --> 17:48.775
-They seem to be working together.
-Still early. A lot can change.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.123
Keep it up! We're doing great!

18:04.166 --> 18:08.836
-We might actually pass!
-Not so fast, still got the Citadel!

18:25.020 --> 18:28.064
All right. Prep the ascension cables.
Let's scale this thing.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.400
Wait a tick. Where are the cables?

18:31.527 --> 18:32.860
They're not on our belts!

18:32.903 --> 18:34.695
Just when things seemed easy.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.532
Well, we can't scale the face
without them!

18:37.658 --> 18:39.367
We'll fail the test if we can't finish.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.537
What's going on?
Where are their ascension cables?

18:42.663 --> 18:44.747
Must have gotten lost.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.376
What did you do?

18:48.877 --> 18:52.588
I thought you had faith
they'd be the best, right?

18:52.714 --> 18:55.716
Well, the best pass. No matter what.

18:56.593 --> 19:00.054
General, you have to stop this.
This is unfair to the cadets.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.349
Adversity in war is a constant, El-Les.

19:03.392 --> 19:07.603
-But Bric has cheated.
-The enemy won't play fair either.

19:07.896 --> 19:11.607
-So, this is it?
-No, not exactly. Those guns up there.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.277
We can use them
as a step to the next level.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.780
Form a chain
and use each other to scale this face.

19:17.906 --> 19:23.077
-Use the guns? Are you crazy?
-Trust me. I know weapons.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.580
I'm gonna draw their fire,
you guys blast them.

19:45.767 --> 19:51.230
Well, I'll be...
Creative little clones, aren't they?

19:51.273 --> 19:53.774
No unit has shown such ingenuity.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.614
(ALL CHEERING)

19:59.656 --> 20:01.657
-We did it!
-Yeah!

20:02.159 --> 20:04.285
-I knew we could do it, boys!
-We made it!

20:04.620 --> 20:10.166
Bric, your actions have brought out
the best in these cadets.

20:10.292 --> 20:14.962
Looks like they were well-trained.
Perhaps the finest soldiers I've ever seen.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.257
Well, maybe you were right, El-Les.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.223
Congratulations, you've graduated.
At ease.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.395
Next stop, ARC trooper!

20:31.480 --> 20:33.814
Yeah, how about
we face some combat first?

20:34.191 --> 20:37.193
You were right, you know.
About everything.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.904
I heard
you were quite the leader out there.

20:39.988 --> 20:43.324
No leaders. We are a team.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.576
All of us, 99.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.579
The army's lucky
to have a clone like you, Hevy.

20:48.664 --> 20:53.000
Not as lucky as I am
to have a brother like you.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.672
Well, this is goodbye, I guess.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.717
Hevy ships out and 99 stays here.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.595
We'll see each other again.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.516
I mean, how else am I supposed
to get this back from you?

21:11.228 --> 21:14.188
You deserve it. You're one of us.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.197
Today is your graduation.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.909
From here, you ship out
to fight against the Separatists

21:27.035 --> 21:29.370
and restore peace to the Republic.

21:29.413 --> 21:35.084
Congratulations! You are no longer cadets.
You are troopers.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.586
May the Force be with you.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.380
Attention!

21:40.132 --> 21:41.382
Helmets on!

22:33.310 --> 22:34.352
