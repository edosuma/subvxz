WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.237
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.606
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.639 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.783
Only on Fox.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.488
OTTO: My father and his sister
Andrea were known as Fenris.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.226
as your children.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.999
Mutants in that lab,
I could feel the agony.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.368
My family is in there.
They're running out of time.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.370
There is a power substation
a few miles away.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.174
before their systems
came back online.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.676
There is a Sentinel robot
and armed teams in the building!

00:42.710 --> 00:45.279
Get out of there now!

00:45.313 --> 00:46.347
DREAMER:
Clarice!

00:46.380 --> 00:48.449
Go!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.184
-DREAMER: Hurry!
-Freeze!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.488
We can get out
if we do what we did before.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.396
What are you doing?

01:02.430 --> 01:04.365
If we do it,
everyone's gonna die.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.234
Stay where you are!

01:06.267 --> 01:08.702
-No! -Cait, wait!
There's nothing we can do.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.404
Those are our children, Reed!

01:10.438 --> 01:12.373
It's over.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.810
(cheers and applause)

01:16.844 --> 01:20.714
America has always been
a beacon to the world.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.218
Life, liberty,
the pursuit of happiness--

01:24.252 --> 01:28.422
sacred rights granted to us
by our founding fathers.

01:28.456 --> 01:31.725
But today, sadly,
there are those

01:33.761 --> 01:35.363
-(crowd cheers in agreement)
-Yeah! -Yeah!

01:35.396 --> 01:37.598
-MAN: That's right.
-MONTEZ: That's right!

01:37.631 --> 01:40.268
Yes, too many
in the mutant population

01:40.301 --> 01:43.271
abuse their so-called abilities

01:43.304 --> 01:47.175
to intimidate hardworking
citizens of our great state.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.578
To steal, destroy, murder.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.847
Mutant crime is at an all-time
high, and it's getting worse.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.484
-(crowd cheers in agreement)
-Yeah! -We agree! -That's right!

01:56.517 --> 02:00.254
As your senator,
I've worked hard to create laws

02:04.458 --> 02:06.327
But our fight is just beginning.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.097
Now, if you reelect me as your
senator, I promise you this:

02:10.130 --> 02:14.268
it is a fight
we will win together!

02:16.136 --> 02:19.473
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.110
Appreciate it.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.214
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.452
Nice job.
You crushed it out there.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.187
Who the hell put
this event together?

02:33.221 --> 02:34.888
Did you see the crowd?
We should've had double that.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.424
That's your base.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.326
Yeah, well, we need to reach
beyond the base.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.264
Some balls?

02:43.297 --> 02:44.832
Precisely.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.767
I'm supposed to let you know
that your car is here

02:46.800 --> 02:48.269
to take you
to your next meeting.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.406
Thanks, Stephanie.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.779
I, uh, I was wondering...

02:58.812 --> 03:01.315
is there any way
I could sit in on the meeting?

03:01.349 --> 03:04.318
I've heard all the stories about
how you work a room, Senator.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.553
Want to learn
from the master, huh?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.821
Matt, donors can get
prickly about...

03:09.357 --> 03:11.892
-Just remember, hon, silence
is golden. -(phone rings)

03:13.527 --> 03:15.162
Montez.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.664
Yeah, listen,
I'm about to head in.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.699
(woman screaming)

03:20.701 --> 03:22.169
WOMAN (echoing):
Get out, now!

03:22.202 --> 03:24.405
They know! Go.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.674
They know.
They're after you.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.677
Sentinel Services. They know!
Go! Get out, now!

03:29.710 --> 03:31.645
They know! Go!

03:32.913 --> 03:35.883
-How many?
-WOMAN: Go, now!

03:35.916 --> 03:37.618
MONTEZ:
Of course. Thank you.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.952
What was that?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.554
Sentinel Services.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.425
They just made some arrests.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.360
(sirens approaching)

03:46.394 --> 03:48.195
Where's Stephanie?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.265
(tires screeching)

03:51.299 --> 03:53.367
-Slow down.
-Hey!

03:53.401 --> 03:54.602
(panting)

03:57.805 --> 03:59.773
Police went inside.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.975
WOMAN IN CROWD:
Watch it.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.878
-WOMAN: Help! Help! Find
Sentinel Services. -(screams)

04:04.912 --> 04:07.615
They came for us,
now they're coming for you.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.717
-Help. Please.
-(man grunts)

04:09.750 --> 04:10.718
Please, please.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.354
Find us. Find us. Find us!

04:13.387 --> 04:15.389
*

04:21.929 --> 04:23.230
Okay, well, I say we go now,

04:23.263 --> 04:24.432
since everyone's still
in holding.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.233
I mean, Reed and I were
locked up in there together.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.435
-We know the whole layout.
-You want to

04:27.468 --> 04:28.736
hit Sentinel Services--
are you crazy?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.404
-Don't call me crazy.
-Okay, everyone take it easy.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.408
on the heels of what we just
went through, with no way in.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.776
Which part of that doesn't
sound crazy to you?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.277
-Hey. -Okay, do I have to
remind you that

04:37.311 --> 04:38.546
it's not just our people
that are in there?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.448
-They have your kids, too.
-We saw men with guns

04:40.481 --> 04:42.583
cart away our kids
while they cried for our help,

04:45.453 --> 04:47.455
-that puts them in more danger.
-(all shouting at once)

04:47.488 --> 04:48.656
That's enough!

04:50.023 --> 04:53.260
There is no more
"yours" or "ours."

04:53.293 --> 04:58.399
Andy and Lauren...
Sonya and Clarice.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.434
They're all our people now.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.971
Turning their jail cells into a
shooting gallery hurts everyone.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.973
Maybe. But it's just
a matter of time

05:07.641 --> 05:09.309
and turns them into Hounds.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.445
If that happens,
this place is finished.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.613
It might already be finished.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.647
There are people we can talk to.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.748
What, we write our congressman

05:14.782 --> 05:15.749
and hope for the best?

05:15.783 --> 05:16.784
If we have to shed blood sooner

05:16.817 --> 05:18.419
or later, I vote for sooner.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.621
That's our blood
you're talking about.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.624
we tried something like this.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.958
I know people in the courts,
the government,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.294
-even Sentinel Services.
-Last time you tried that,

05:27.327 --> 05:28.762
-we almost got killed.
-Okay, it was

05:28.796 --> 05:30.764
your "low risk" assault
that got us into

05:30.798 --> 05:31.899
-this situation.
-Look, guys!

05:31.932 --> 05:34.301
The enemy is not in this room.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.969
We're all in this together.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.472
And we should set up some scouts
at Sentinel Services and Trask.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.374
Maybe they can get eyes
on our people.

05:40.408 --> 05:44.378
Marcos is right-- we can
send out Sage and Shatter.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.647
And also check in
with our police contacts.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.082
We are gonna fight
to get everyone home.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.686
But we need to remember,
we're on the same side.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.065
Ugh. This thing itches.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.704
Look, we can't just sit around,
okay?

06:10.738 --> 06:12.673
We've been locked up
in here for hours.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.842
Hey. We want a lawyer,
or whatever!

06:14.875 --> 06:17.077
-Can any of you creeps hear me?
-Don't do that.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.079
-Andy, please.
-I said we want a...

06:19.112 --> 06:22.115
-(collar buzzing)
-Andy!

06:22.149 --> 06:24.051
(grunting)

06:24.084 --> 06:26.086
(panting)

06:27.455 --> 06:29.690
Ow...

06:29.723 --> 06:32.426
You okay?

06:34.495 --> 06:35.863
What's gonna happen now?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.133
They have to charge us
at some point.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.739
I don't know.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.041
I'm scared.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.911
Me, too.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.015
Do you think... do you think
we could have used

06:57.585 --> 06:58.986
I know I said we couldn't.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.854
But now, I feel like
we're trapped in here,

07:02.456 --> 07:04.458
No.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.494
You were right.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.095
There were innocent people
in that building

07:08.128 --> 07:09.463
who would've died.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.565
You saved them.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.435
Who's gonna save us?

07:24.712 --> 07:28.716
because... you got lost?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.751
A power station that
just so happens to be connected

07:30.784 --> 07:32.820
to a top secret
research facility.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
We were looking
for the aquarium.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.825
It's all in there.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.163
Ms. Simonson, do you remember
the last time we met?

07:43.196 --> 07:45.766
Of course,
it's a little hazy for me

07:45.799 --> 07:47.635
because you scrambled my brain
to cover your tracks.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.844
of the last few days
of my daughter's life.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.981
I went home that night
to read her a bedtime story,

08:01.014 --> 08:05.686
and my wife had to stop me
and remind me

08:05.719 --> 08:07.988
that she was dead.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.691
And that she had been
for four years.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.760
So, thanks to you,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.664
to lose...

08:21.569 --> 08:25.238
...my only child...

08:25.272 --> 08:27.207
all over again.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.546
That... that was an accident.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.851
I'm so sorry.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.822
You're sorry?

08:43.591 --> 08:45.959
-(pounds table)
-(gasps)

08:45.993 --> 08:50.564
You think I want
an apology from you? No.

08:50.598 --> 08:53.000
I want you to pay.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.669
And I want you to know

08:55.703 --> 08:58.238
that this is extremely
personal for me.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.676
You take care.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.511
That's it?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.814
No more questions?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.616
No, no, no.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.184
What we want from you, we're not
gonna get it from a Q and A.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.887
What are you talking about?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.022
You're familiar with
the Hound Program?

09:15.055 --> 09:17.858
Oh, that's right, no.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.061
It's run out of that lab
that you know nothing about.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.619
(door beeps, unlocks)

09:47.955 --> 09:49.823
WEEKS (over intercom):
You expect us to believe

09:49.857 --> 09:51.224
you were looking for a bathroom?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.597
You think you're going
to escape, like last time?

09:57.631 --> 09:58.932
You got lucky once,
won't happen again.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.101
Actually, luck had nothing
to do with it.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.970
I made you guys
look like idiots.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.104
It's a pretty good skill.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.211
now is the moment.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.047
You won't like the next stop
on this train.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.716
BLINK: As long as it's
not here with you,

10:15.749 --> 10:18.051
it's starting to sound
pretty damn good.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.054
WEEKS: I can promise you
it won't be here with me.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.056
We know why you were
at the power station.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.958
-We know why you were going to
the lab. -(phone beeps, rings)

10:24.992 --> 10:27.094
We just want to know what
you were looking for.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.261
CAMPBELL (over phone):
Yes?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.664
Dr. Campbell,
it's Agent Turner.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.833
I understand you've been
discharged from the hospital.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.668
CAMPBELL:
I had assistance in my recovery

10:34.702 --> 10:36.269
from one of the mutant assets.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.106
It was a painful process,
but there's work to be done.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.008
I understand you caught
some of our friends

10:42.743 --> 10:45.913
Um, we're not really
getting anywhere with them.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.615
I think it might be time
to send them on over to you.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.051
I think that's
an excellent idea.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.286
I can send an armored
transport right over.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.389
The prisoners are
Clarice Fong and Sonya Simonson.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.992
And the Strucker children, yes?

10:59.026 --> 11:02.362
Andrew and Lauren Strucker
haven't been processed yet.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.932
The other two are adults,
they're convicted criminals.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.934
We had a deal, Agent Turner.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.936
A deal I expect you to honor.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.337
Don't forget,
I can get you information

11:10.370 --> 11:11.805
on the Mutant Underground

11:11.839 --> 11:13.673
that you're so desperate
to dismantle.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.176
But first,
I'm gonna need your prisoners.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.178
All of them.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.817
All right.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.685
They're yours.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.032
We could try your friend
from law school, the-the judge.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.367
He's a federal
appeals court judge

11:40.400 --> 11:42.335
in New England--
even if we got him

11:42.369 --> 11:44.404
on our side, he has
no jurisdiction over anything.

11:44.437 --> 11:47.707
What about the people who worked
at the Trask facility?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.409
You said you knew them.
Maybe there's someone there

11:49.442 --> 11:51.979
-we could talk to. -I checked.
I know a few of them,

11:52.012 --> 11:54.014
but they're not gonna be able
to get Andy and Lauren

11:55.883 --> 11:57.684
JACE:
We ar gonna make a deal today.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.252
Your job was to stay in the van.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.721
I'm Agent Turner,
with the Sentinel Services.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.392
I'm sorry to interrupt.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.426
Can I...?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.228
Uh, come in.

12:08.261 --> 12:11.064
I was thinking...

12:11.098 --> 12:13.166
about what you said
at the meeting earlier.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.701
I think you're right.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.004
Another attack is
just gonna get people killed.

12:17.037 --> 12:20.140
We both have family in there,
and we cannot have that happen.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.042
This is a human problem.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.881
who understand that world.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.082
We're not having
much luck finding

12:29.116 --> 12:30.217
-anyone who can help.
-Well,

12:30.250 --> 12:32.052
I was actually thinking...

12:33.921 --> 12:35.188
(Caitlin exhales)

12:38.091 --> 12:39.726
You've talked
to him before, right?

12:39.759 --> 12:40.894
When he interrogated me.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.096
Okay, look, I'm...
I'm not saying

12:43.130 --> 12:44.731
it's gonna be easy, but...

12:44.764 --> 12:47.100
he may be the only one
who can actually do something.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.771
out of the lab,
to do the right thing...

12:51.805 --> 12:54.074
So they can sit in prison?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.742
(exhales)

12:55.775 --> 12:57.377
It's better than
being injected with drugs

12:59.813 --> 13:03.116
If there is even a chance...

13:03.150 --> 13:04.417
just think about it.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.191
in the wrong hands, that much
power could change everything.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.193
*

13:24.004 --> 13:25.438
You all right?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.941
How do you think I am?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.410
Sentinel Services has
my best friend.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.779
-We're working on it.
-Working on it.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.316
How? By talking to the Struckers
about lawyers?

13:39.152 --> 13:40.820
(sighs)

13:41.821 --> 13:43.456
Don't be too hard on them.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.925
(scoffs)

13:44.958 --> 13:46.927
They came from that world.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.229
You know, part of them
still believes in it.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.133
What, so they get
a pass forever?

13:53.166 --> 13:56.136
They're allowed to cozy up
to the people that hate us?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.911
I know.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.479
But I think about our own kid.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.316
And the world we're
bringing that baby into.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.851
It's not fair.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.129
(door buzzes in distance)

14:26.099 --> 14:28.501
I don't know, I just...

14:28.535 --> 14:31.271
I just hope they're okay.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.978
A long time ago, before...

14:40.580 --> 14:43.516
I used to volunteer
at this place,

14:43.550 --> 14:46.886
a shelter for... battered women.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.525
They'd been through such...

14:52.559 --> 14:54.494
terrible things.

14:54.527 --> 14:58.365
Sometimes I'd secretly use
my powers on them.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.269
Pull their worst memories
from their minds.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.374
You can't think like that.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.009
Do you know how scared I was

15:09.042 --> 15:11.044
when I was
in the mutant detention center?

15:14.247 --> 15:15.515
I almost portaled myself

15:15.548 --> 15:17.584
into the middle
of a ten-lane freeway.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.286
But I got out.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.356
(quietly):
But this feels...

15:23.390 --> 15:25.258
impossible.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.060
It's not.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.928
It's not impossible.

15:28.962 --> 15:32.065
It's only impossible
if you give up.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.633
John...

15:37.404 --> 15:41.074
He's gonna figure something out.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.411
We just need to hang on
until then.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.246
Okay?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.923
And even if we succeed,
they're gonna be in jail.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.493
I-In that lab...

16:00.527 --> 16:02.595
-I know. I know.
-If we're gonna do this,

16:02.629 --> 16:04.131
we need to do it now.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.166
Leave without telling anybody.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.268
Are you sure?
I mean, sneaking away...

16:08.301 --> 16:10.103
They don't want us
talking to anyone,

16:10.137 --> 16:12.105
much less
a Sentinel Service agent.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.948
The files we got
from the courthouse had

16:21.981 --> 16:24.317
the addresses of all the agents
working on the program.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.157
Get the address.
I'll get some supplies

16:30.190 --> 16:32.125
and keys to one of the cars.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
Is there anything else we need?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.432
(sighs)

16:55.382 --> 16:57.484
Lauren and Andrew.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.152
Welcome.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.288
I've been looking forward
to this moment.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.522
What did you do
with our friends?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.990
They're fine.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.325
My concern is the two of you.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.161
I am... very excited
to get to know you.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.132
Why are we wearing these things?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.167
They're to measure
your biometrics.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.709
He and his sister Andrea

17:22.742 --> 17:25.512
shared a trait that I believe
the two of you have inherited--

17:25.545 --> 17:28.315
the ability
to combine your powers.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.483
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.156
has recently
been exploring his past,

17:36.189 --> 17:38.558
which led
to this unpleasantness.

17:38.591 --> 17:41.128
Which includes your
grandfather's Trask research.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.230
I hope to find it first,
but today we'll see

17:43.263 --> 17:46.065
if you do share
your ancestors' special gift.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.203
Take them to testing.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.239
GUARD:
Let's go.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.222
(door closes, echoes)

18:09.256 --> 18:12.459
What's happening?

18:12.492 --> 18:15.128
I don't know.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.430
CAMPBELL (over speaker):
Welcome to the testing room.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.765
Are you curious about the walls?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.467
They're lined with adamantium,

18:20.500 --> 18:22.535
an extremely rare
metallic alloy.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.070
Took a while to acquire.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.439
We had found some in
a defunct military installation

18:26.473 --> 18:27.640
in British Columbia.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.609
It's indestructible,
so it's perfect

18:29.642 --> 18:32.111
for... exploring powers.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.548
You'll face
those sensors, there.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.219
Join hands to combine abilities,
and demonstrate.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.625
Whenever you're ready, children.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.428
Forget it.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.298
We're not doing anything
for you.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.702
-(collar buzzing)
-(grunts, yells)

18:55.735 --> 18:58.805
-Hey! Hey! Stop it!
Leave her alone! -(gags, coughs)

18:58.838 --> 19:01.374
I will leave her alone as soon
as you do as you're told.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.843
-Hey.
-(gasps, coughs)

19:14.321 --> 19:16.256
You can drop me, too.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.590
Go ahead.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.592
We still won't do it.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.262
I was hoping we could do this
the easy way.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.863
Ah, well.

19:23.896 --> 19:27.334
*

19:34.341 --> 19:36.476
Lawns, the flags...

19:36.509 --> 19:38.845
I wonder how patriotic
they'd feel if they knew

19:38.878 --> 19:40.847
their fellow Americans
were being used

19:40.880 --> 19:43.483
as science experiments
15 miles away.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.654
Honestly, I...

19:47.687 --> 19:50.690
I think a lot of them
would be fine with it.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.462
or put up holiday decorations

19:55.495 --> 19:58.465
knowing that people
were suffering, but...

19:58.498 --> 20:00.833
(sighs)

20:00.867 --> 20:02.669
...I did.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.372
We all did.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.778
Is this crazy?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.780
I mean, you think
you could do this?

20:13.813 --> 20:15.348
I'm gonna try.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.351
I mean, Turner, on some level,
I think, is a good man.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.886
He's just angry.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.224
(sighs)

20:30.563 --> 20:33.500
-Cait, are you sure?
-My dad put a gun in my hand

20:38.905 --> 20:41.240
It's just like
riding a bike, right?

20:46.313 --> 20:48.881
-Just go over the layout again.
-I've been over it 100 times.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.585
-Well, make it 101, for me.
-Okay, fine.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.953
The security was tight before;
it's gonna be

20:53.986 --> 20:55.588
-worse now.
-There has to be something,

20:55.622 --> 20:57.457
-something we missed...
-Yeah, it's locked down.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.225
Shatter's out there scouting,
but I don't think

20:59.258 --> 21:01.260
-it's looking good.
-ESME: Hey.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.562
Can I talk to you guys?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.996
What is it?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.568
how before, they were talking
about wanting to talk

21:08.601 --> 21:10.570
to someone,
like a judge or a lawyer?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.872
And I made it clear
that was a bad idea.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.241
Well, I don't think
they were convinced.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.444
I try not to read people's minds
without their permission.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.446
I know people get nervous
around telepaths, but sometimes

21:21.781 --> 21:22.949
something from them?

21:22.982 --> 21:25.585
Okay, I...

21:25.618 --> 21:30.423
-I think they may have gone
to talk to Agent Turner. -What?!

21:30.457 --> 21:32.425
-They went to a Sentinel Service
officer? -I know.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.761
I-I mean, I wasn't sure, but
then I saw that they were gone,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.996
-and I thought I should
tell someone. -(groans)

21:40.433 --> 21:42.435
(ice cubes clinking)

21:42.469 --> 21:44.471
*

21:52.311 --> 21:54.414
Day was that bad, huh?

21:55.948 --> 21:57.950
Nah, I'm-I'm good.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.487
Don't lie to me, babe.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.756
Radio's on.
Three fingers in the glass.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.992
I know what
that math adds up to.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.627
It's just work stuff.
It's no big deal.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.963
(chuckles):
It's...

22:10.997 --> 22:13.466
I'm just a little exhausted,
that's all.

22:16.335 --> 22:19.572
Can you talk about it?

22:24.043 --> 22:26.345
all of this on your shoulders.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.816
I am so proud of you.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.651
You need to take time off.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.820
No, I'm-I'm right in the middle
of something big. I can't...

22:33.853 --> 22:37.323
What, you want to end up
like your father?

22:37.356 --> 22:39.659
Leave me widowed at 40?

22:42.695 --> 22:46.332
Make a pretty hot widow, though.
(chuckles)

22:46.365 --> 22:48.000
(doorbell rings)

22:48.034 --> 22:50.803
I will get that.

22:50.837 --> 22:54.774
And you... can get me a drink,
please.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.376
-Yes, ma'am.
-(chuckles)

23:01.380 --> 23:03.883
PAULA:
Can I help...

23:03.916 --> 23:05.718
Jace, baby?

23:09.889 --> 23:12.425
Agent Turner.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.729
We need to talk.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.037
The Struckers
didn't say anything.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.573
They just left?

23:26.606 --> 23:27.740
Yeah, we checked
the whole building.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.710
They're gone.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.512
They had some idea
about convincing Agent Turner

23:32.545 --> 23:33.846
to get everyone out of the lab,

23:33.880 --> 23:35.648
as if a lifetime
spent behind bars

23:37.917 --> 23:40.386
They're humans.
Even if they succeed,

23:40.419 --> 23:41.988
and he moves them to a mutant
detention center tonight,

23:42.021 --> 23:43.723
-they're gone.
-Wait.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.091
If we really think
that there's a chance,

23:45.124 --> 23:46.759
even a small one,
that Agent Turner

23:48.094 --> 23:49.529
We might be able to rescue them.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.097
That's still a big risk.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.566
I mean, the last time we hit
them, they came back at us hard.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.001
All the more reason to hit back.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.571
It's possible.

23:58.605 --> 23:59.639
Reed was a lawyer.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.140
I mean, he was one of them.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.412
Shatter's still scouting
at Trask.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.715
He needs to know
what might be coming.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.618
JACE:
You think kidnapping us

24:11.651 --> 24:13.686
is gonna help your cause?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.688
Sentinel Services

24:15.722 --> 24:17.590
does not negotiate
with terrorists.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.428
At the end of this,
we're gonna walk away.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.963
What happens after is up to you.

24:26.499 --> 24:29.602
our children
and the other mutants,

24:29.636 --> 24:32.605
the other people
who are being tortured.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.107
Every single mutant
in that facil...

24:35.141 --> 24:36.976
Why don't we just hear them out?

24:40.479 --> 24:44.651
We are here because I've seen
your record, Agent Turner.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.587
And I believe that
you're a good man.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.789
But I'm also here
'cause you're a father

24:49.822 --> 24:52.792
and you have dealt
with the pain of seeing

24:52.825 --> 24:55.662
your child
get caught up in a war

24:55.695 --> 24:57.163
she did not start,

24:57.196 --> 24:59.932
a war that began
before she was even born.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.802
What is it that
you want from us?

25:02.835 --> 25:06.639
The program that Dr. Campbell
is running, it is not right.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.107
You people are
out of your minds.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.976
You think I'm gonna let
an entire facility

25:12.879 --> 25:14.513
'Cause you bust in my house,
point a gun

25:14.547 --> 25:16.148
at me and my wife,
and ask politely?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.917
No. All I ask is that you do

25:17.950 --> 25:20.152
what you swore you were gonna do
when you put the badge on.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.088
Uphold the Constitution.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.489
Everything going on in that lab

25:24.824 --> 25:26.225
If you have a problem with that,

25:26.258 --> 25:27.960
there's a thing in this country
called a ballot box.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.168
Marcos, I'm just saying,
if we get the chance,

25:36.202 --> 25:37.837
we have to take it.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.806
I want them out, too,
but we're gonna be dealing

25:39.839 --> 25:41.507
with a group of armed
Sentinel Service agents

25:41.540 --> 25:43.175
on high alert,
along with Trask security.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.944
It could be a bloodbath, Lorna.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.013
What do you suggest, huh?
We beg for mercy

25:47.046 --> 25:48.180
like the Struckers?

25:48.214 --> 25:50.182
-Bank on human decency?
-They're trying to save

25:50.216 --> 25:51.918
the people they love.
I know how that feels.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.553
No. No, you came to get me...

25:54.587 --> 25:57.223
us...

25:59.058 --> 26:00.559
are trying to get their kids
out of some lab,

26:00.593 --> 26:02.561
so what?
So they can sit in prison

26:02.595 --> 26:05.531
for the rest of their lives?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.199
Marcos, would you be able
to accept that?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.601
No, I would not.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.704
But I have seen
a lot of killing.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.040
I know where this goes.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.675
That was the cartel, Marcos.
This is so different.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.946
I have lost more friends
to stupid wars of vengeance

26:19.979 --> 26:21.047
than I can count.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.084
I don't want that for us.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.056
So what?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.892
We just accept living in fear?

26:37.630 --> 26:40.900
Not for me, not for you,

26:40.933 --> 26:44.370
and definitely not for our kid.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.615
How long are they
gonna keep us in here?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.618
I don't know.

27:02.188 --> 27:05.858
But they can't make us
do anything.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.996
They can still shock
the hell out of us.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.298
I know it hurts.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.904
But did you see the way
he was looking at us?

27:17.937 --> 27:20.807
I don't know why he wants us
to combine our powers,

27:20.840 --> 27:22.374
but it's not good.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.111
If we hold out long enough,
someone will come for us.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.113
Hello.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.681
Let's try this again, shall we?

27:28.715 --> 27:30.616
Are you willing to cooperate?

27:30.649 --> 27:32.618
Why don't you just give up, huh?

27:35.254 --> 27:36.756
I think you will.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.791
You just need
additional motivation.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.296
What are you doing?
They're not part of this!

27:44.330 --> 27:46.132
Oh, you made them part of this.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.800
ANDY:
Leave 'em alone.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.136
Whatever happens to them
is entirely in your hands.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.871
Can I have your sidearm, please?

27:53.773 --> 27:55.174
(clears throat)

28:01.680 --> 28:03.850
Just show me what you can do.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.658
Don't do anything for him.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.293
(sighs)

28:25.304 --> 28:29.708
(shouting inaudibly)

28:37.116 --> 28:38.350
BLINK:
Sonya!

28:38.384 --> 28:39.852
Sonya!

28:39.886 --> 28:41.453
No, no!

28:41.487 --> 28:44.857
Is there a need
for more bloodshed?

28:44.891 --> 28:47.426
(panting)

28:48.494 --> 28:50.396
Is there?

28:56.869 --> 29:00.706
-Hey! I'm losing patience!
-(gun cocks)

29:00.739 --> 29:02.741
Lauren, Andrew,
face the sensors.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.045
Lauren...

29:07.279 --> 29:08.247
Lauren, hey.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.882
Lauren.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.750
Lauren, what do we do?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.488
Come on.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.797
*

29:45.417 --> 29:46.919
(computer beeping)

29:51.958 --> 29:54.426
*

29:56.428 --> 29:58.764
REED: When they
combined them together...

29:58.797 --> 30:00.366
ANDY: There weren't two
of us anymore.

30:32.331 --> 30:36.102
(computer beeping rapidly)

30:36.135 --> 30:38.104
TECH: Sir, we're approaching
the limits of our sensors.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.305
Unbelievable.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.973
TECH:
We have to stop them.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.174
The room is indestructible.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.976
Keep monitoring. It'll be fine.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.145
(beeping continues)

30:46.178 --> 30:49.381
*

31:06.098 --> 31:09.068
(muffled yelling)

31:11.137 --> 31:12.404
(sighs)

31:16.875 --> 31:18.844
Take the Struckers back
to their cells.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.013
Oh, and give them
something nice to eat.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.866
They are in there now.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.969
Please, you know this is wrong.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.537
No, I know this is legal.
I know this is authorized...

31:45.571 --> 31:47.139
Just because it's legal,
it makes it right?

31:47.173 --> 31:48.640
I'm not gonna debate this
with you!

31:51.944 --> 31:54.546
I don't know what you two
expected to come out of this.

31:54.580 --> 31:58.150
I'm not in the habit of helping
people who threaten my family.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.952
I'm trying to save my children.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.287
JACE: Yeah, your children,
who were apprehended

32:01.320 --> 32:03.422
attacking
a key infrastructure facility.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.024
Which makes them terrorists.

32:05.057 --> 32:06.625
Terrorists? They are
high school students.

32:15.101 --> 32:18.904
Whatever their circumstances,
your kids are alive.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.040
But for how long?

32:21.073 --> 32:24.410
That's your justification
for experimenting on them?

32:24.443 --> 32:26.045
Torturing them?

32:35.954 --> 32:39.225
I know how upsetting
this must be.

32:40.526 --> 32:45.097
When you came into my house
with a gun,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.937
the last place
I want to be right now.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.506
So I'm gonna say this,

32:54.540 --> 32:56.475
and then we're gonna go.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.513
The program our children are in,

33:01.547 --> 33:04.483
I've seen what it does,
firsthand.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.286
They pump the mutants
full of drugs

33:07.319 --> 33:09.321
until they are
hopelessly addicted.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.657
They're given mental
conditioning,

33:11.690 --> 33:14.126
so they have to do
what they're told, and...

33:15.994 --> 33:20.999
And then, they are sent
to kill everyone they love.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.636
They may be alive, but that...

33:26.338 --> 33:28.374
That's worse than death.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.188
(door opens)

33:45.291 --> 33:47.259
(door closes)

33:47.293 --> 33:48.427
We're gonna be okay, baby.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.429
Don't worry.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.165
I'll have a team on them
in less than five minutes.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.533
Wait, wait.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.735
-Babe.
-Is it true, what she said?

33:56.768 --> 33:59.171
Paula, we're talking
about criminals here.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.372
-They're teenagers.
-No, no.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.507
This is way more
complicated than...

34:01.540 --> 34:03.542
Jace.

34:05.244 --> 34:09.381
Baby, what are you doing
in our little girl's name?

34:14.420 --> 34:16.422
(insects chirping)

34:20.759 --> 34:22.494
(grunts)

34:28.634 --> 34:30.569
(crying)

34:59.165 --> 35:01.433
It's our fault.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.573
She told us not to do it.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.241
And we did it anyway.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.110
She died for nothing.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.821
Like she wasn't even
a real person.

35:29.828 --> 35:32.498
Isn't it like you said?

35:32.531 --> 35:34.866
It's gonna be okay, right?

35:51.817 --> 35:54.820
...we just gave it to him.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.792
Have you recovered biometrics?

36:00.826 --> 36:02.461
-We did, Doctor.
-Let me see.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.629
We were able to isolate
the bonding agent

36:03.662 --> 36:05.831
that contains
the same amino acids

36:05.864 --> 36:07.466
as the other siblings.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.467
Fascinating.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.668
Do you think we've done it?

36:09.701 --> 36:11.837
Yes, we've done it.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.305
(laughs):
We've done it.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.540
We now have a weapon
that provides

36:14.573 --> 36:16.442
a solution
to our mutant problem.

36:16.475 --> 36:17.876
-A permanent one.
-(phone rings)

36:19.945 --> 36:21.847
-What is it?
-WOMAN: Dr. Campbell,

36:21.880 --> 36:23.782
Sentinel Services
has just arrived.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.351
I'll be right there.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.628
Agent Turner.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.430
This is a surprise.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.502
What happened here?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.170
Nothing to worry about.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.672
What can I do for you?

36:46.705 --> 36:50.276
I've been reviewing the status
of the detainees here.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.378
I'm not... satisfied

36:52.411 --> 36:54.813
-that any of this is legal.
-Uh, we had a deal,

36:54.846 --> 36:56.715
-I believe.
-Yeah, we did.

36:56.748 --> 37:00.552
I'm revisiting that deal,
and I'm taking the mutants.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.492
Where's the redhead?
Sonya Simonson?

37:06.525 --> 37:09.695
There was an incident
during one of our experiments,

37:09.728 --> 37:11.763
and she didn't make it,
I'm afraid.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.257
Hey!

37:39.291 --> 37:40.959
I just got word from Shatter.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.330
Sentinel Services is at Trask
with a large transport vehicle.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.598
The Struckers did it.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.500
-I'll be damned.
-All right.

37:48.534 --> 37:49.835
We don't have a lot of time.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.938
When they're moving,
we're gonna be ready here

37:52.971 --> 37:55.240
-and here. -Yeah,
we surround them on the road,

37:55.273 --> 37:56.542
free the prisoners,

37:56.575 --> 37:57.909
and hightail it south
to the interstate.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.611
And we're gonna have
one or two minutes, tops.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.449
They might have hounds.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.484
Send me in.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.685
If someone can get me
close enough,

38:06.718 --> 38:09.254
I can scout security,
read one of the guards.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.628
Okay. Let's do it.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.481
(leaves rustling)

38:35.514 --> 38:36.782
Hey, what do you see?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.584
Two Sentinel Services SUVs,

38:39.951 --> 38:41.620
And they all rolled in
pretty hot.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.431
They just left the building.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.565
They're gonna be
at the gate soon.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.968
-It's a group. -All right,
we go in now, find out

38:57.002 --> 38:59.471
-what we can from the guard
at the booth. -Come on.

38:59.505 --> 39:00.606
Stay close.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.846
coming back here
after what you did.

39:07.879 --> 39:11.316
Wait, w-wait, Esme told you
what we were doing?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.318
Not just me.
She told everyone here

39:17.355 --> 39:18.524
you making a deal

39:18.557 --> 39:19.825
to let all those folks
go to jail.

39:19.858 --> 39:20.892
But it was her idea.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.663
What?

39:24.696 --> 39:26.331
She came to us.
She was the one who suggested

39:26.364 --> 39:27.499
we go to Agent Turner.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.501
That isn't what she said.

39:30.469 --> 39:31.503
CAITLIN:
She lied to us.

39:31.537 --> 39:32.638
Where are the others?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.339
Trask.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.340
What?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.842
But we said we wouldn't attack.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.710
We can't just leave
our people there.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.546
Esme said she had a plan.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.808
Authorization for a transfer.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.810
-You're taking out prisoners?
-Yeah. That's right.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.044
Which ones?

40:13.078 --> 40:15.514
All of 'em.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.884
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.386
They brought more guys
than I thought.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.721
ESME:
Oh, I think it'll be all right.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.922
All right?

40:23.955 --> 40:25.924
Listen, the plan is to...
(grunts)

40:29.695 --> 40:31.029
I've got my own plan.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.631
(grunts softly)

40:38.504 --> 40:40.405
-Who authorized this?
-What do you mean?

40:40.438 --> 40:41.640
Sentinel Services.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.408
I'm gonna have to call this in.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.043
(sighs) Knock yourself out, man.
They're gonna tell you

40:46.745 --> 40:48.013
These are our prisoners.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.781
They're on loan to this
facility; we have the legal

40:49.815 --> 40:51.449
authority to take them back
whenever we please.

40:51.483 --> 40:54.419
It's time
to turn off the collars.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.888
