Previously onDeputy...

00:02.350 --> 00:03.999
[gunshots]

00:04.040 --> 00:06.213
Shot a hostage.
Destroyed a family.

00:06.260 --> 00:07.477
Think before you shoot.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.828
How about you give me some tips

00:08.870 --> 00:10.212
instead of telling me
how bad I'm doing?

00:10.270 --> 00:11.828
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.302
-My name is Joseph--
-Get down on the ground!

00:13.360 --> 00:16.318
Asking me to look into
an LAPD case on your old buddy

00:16.360 --> 00:17.577
is no small ask.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.929
Can you point to the man
you work for?

00:19.970 --> 00:21.096
Turn around, Detective.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.142
I'm finding it
harder and harder

00:23.190 --> 00:24.839
to justify being
in a relationship

00:24.890 --> 00:26.278
where I'm chastised
for being me.

00:26.890 --> 00:28.585
My gender is non-binary.

00:28.630 --> 00:30.678
And Genevieve
couldn't accept that.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.325
Their grandmother
contacted DCSF.

00:33.380 --> 00:34.415
Grandmother?

00:34.460 --> 00:35.859
Yeah, she wants to see them.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.333
It's my understanding
Sheriff Hollister

00:37.380 --> 00:39.200
has no plans of running
for reelection.

00:39.730 --> 00:41.550
I_ consider this_
my Insurance policy.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.079
So, you're running now?

00:43.130 --> 00:45.769
Nothing's ever completely
off the table, Jerry.

00:48.260 --> 00:51.047
BILL:
District Attorney Riley,
who exactly wins

00:51.090 --> 00:53.399
when the DA refuses
to go after a murderer?

00:53.440 --> 00:55.874
I have to think about
the big picture, Sheriff.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.047
I've handed you the guaranteed
conviction of a corrupt cop.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.704
How are you not
running with this?

00:59.750 --> 01:02.571
Prosecuting
an LAPD officer in court

01:02.620 --> 01:05.180
will create a media circus,
for weeks.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.959
The citizens
of Los Angeles County

01:07.020 --> 01:08.362
deserve better.

01:08.410 --> 01:11.231
Well, the badge
stands for more than words.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.625
If we don't stand for
rule of law, then who will?

01:14.680 --> 01:17.763
LAPD and the
Sheriff's Department

01:17.810 --> 01:20.278
need to be working with
one another, not against.

01:20.340 --> 01:21.466
So then what do you propose?

01:21.510 --> 01:23.762
I propose that
we offer him a plea.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.729
Listen, we spare the city
the spectacle.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.816
D_etectiye Johnson
Just disappears.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.386
I'm not cosigning this.

01:31.430 --> 01:32.647
The call is mine.

01:33.130 --> 01:34.256
That's true.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.471
However, I doubt
a public conflict

01:36.530 --> 01:38.259
between the sheriff and the DA

01:38.310 --> 01:40.961
will be any less disruptive
to the county

01:41.010 --> 01:43.092
than an LAPD_o_fficer
gomg to Jail

01:43.140 --> 01:45.700
for a crime
he absolutely committed.

01:46.710 --> 01:47.927
Are you threatening me?

01:47.970 --> 01:49.699
Oh, I don't threaten,
Miss Riley.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.794
I just let it be known
I won't back down from a fight.

01:54.460 --> 01:57.930
We cannot turn a blind eye
to corruption within our ranks.

01:57.980 --> 01:59.413
Penod.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.678
And if you attempt
to make this case go away,

02:01.730 --> 02:04.460
we will be having words
in a very public way.

02:04.510 --> 02:09.777
Will you be telling the public
that your godson, Joseph Harris,

02:09.820 --> 02:13.119
is good friends with
the key witness against Johnson,

02:13.170 --> 02:15.422
and that Harris
had a gun pulled on him

02:15.480 --> 02:17.823
by an LAPD officer just prior,

02:17.870 --> 02:19.599
clearly biasing him,

02:19.660 --> 02:21.434
circumstances that you ignored

02:21.480 --> 02:22.959
when you prioritized the case

02:23.010 --> 02:25.524
that your godson
pushed you to investigate?

02:26.010 --> 02:28.262
Your first mistake
was to think I'd roll over

02:28.320 --> 02:30.276
while you sought a PR victory

02:30.320 --> 02:31.878
instead of defending the law.

02:31.930 --> 02:35.184
Your second mistake was
bringing my family into this.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.969
This isn't over.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.409
I'm a lawyer.
Everything is negotiable.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.671
Everything except the truth.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.019
[scoffs]

02:55.260 --> 02:56.818
Did you get my milkshake?

02:56.870 --> 02:58.349
We both got tacos and chips.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.346
Didn't have enough
for a shake.

03:00.390 --> 03:02.529
Should have just got me
my milkshake.

wide open.

That's trust.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.360
[quietly]:
Come on. Come on!

03:29.730 --> 03:30.936
Check it out.

03:30.990 --> 03:32.412
He left his backpack
in the back seat.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.377
Grab it.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.036
What if he comes?

03:39.560 --> 03:41.551
Do you wanna keep eating
off the dollar menu?

03:46.130 --> 03:47.210
I can't reach.

03:47.830 --> 03:48.910
I got it.

03:50.790 --> 03:51.745
Grab it.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.296
You remember her,
right, Roberto?

04:17.340 --> 04:18.295

04:18.340 --> 04:20.251
Kind of. She's old.

[Cade laughs]

04:22.210 --> 04:23.256
"She's old."

04:23.300 --> 04:24.289
You're excited though, right?

04:24.350 --> 04:25.829

04:25.870 --> 04:27.428
-Yeah.
-Camilla?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.254
Can I bring Snuffy?

04:29.310 --> 04:30.436
Of course you can.

Okay, you got your stuff?

Oh, you have gotten so big!

04:58.990 --> 05:00.639
Thank you so much.

05:00.690 --> 05:02.988
Everything you've done
for my grandkids.

05:03.650 --> 05:04.947
I'm grateful.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.468
It's been too long
since I've seen these two.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.600
[chuckles]

05:09.000 --> 05:11.218
Uh, why don't you
take them out to the car

05:11.260 --> 05:12.568

to the Wards for a minute?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.651
Yes, of course.

TERESA: I'll see you
a little later, okay?

05:20.580 --> 05:21.740
It's gonna be fine.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.399
Bye, sweetie.

05:30.670 --> 05:31.978
Bet it was hard for Carmen

05:32.020 --> 05:33.362
when her daughter
got mixed up with Sombra.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.365
Yeah, they didn't speak
for a long time.

05:35.420 --> 05:36.978
I know she's
their grandmother

05:37.030 --> 05:39.498

she's a complete stranger.

are in good hands.

[clears throat]
You all right, sir?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.406
It's the badge, isn't it?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.239
It's intimidating.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.315
I know.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.068
You are the sheriff.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.145
Iam.

07:01.370 --> 07:02.803
But I'm not gonna
interrogate you, so...

07:02.850 --> 07:04.067
Okay.

07:04.110 --> 07:05.634
Doesn't mean_
I won't ask questions,

07:05.680 --> 07:08.023
but I trust my daughter

07:08.770 --> 07:10.590
and she seems_ to think
you're all right.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.166
Thank you, sir.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.110
Do I need to
remind you to, uh,

07:14.170 --> 07:15.819
treat Maggie with respect,

07:15.870 --> 07:17.735
get her home on time,
any of that stuff?

07:17.780 --> 07:18.997
No, sir, you don't.

07:20.130 --> 07:21.859
Then we're gonna get along
just fine, Wyatt.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.176
Because I know that you know

07:25.220 --> 07:27.745
that I know what it's like
to be a teenage boy.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.564
You know
what I'm getting at, right?

07:29.620 --> 07:31.485
I don't like surprises.

07:31.530 --> 07:34.488
So as long as you get that,
we're good.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.105
That's great.
It smells crazy good.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.639
I was just saying to Wyatt...

07:50.030 --> 07:51.156
Did I say something wrong?

Let's eat.

You know, this reminds me
of when Jorge met Bill.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.478
-He did not like you.
-He loved me.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.942
He also did that first night

08:02.000 --> 08:03.956
what you have to do
for your daughter right now,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.774
which is respect her choices

08:05.830 --> 08:07.479
and give Wyatt
the benefit of the doubt.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.781
I will.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.173
But after, I'm calling Jorge,
having words.

Okay, easy.
What's going on?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.420
I didn't know
who else to call. I...

I stole this guy's backpack.

It was stupid.

You're not stupid.
You made a poor choice.

ISOBEL:
This was one of those.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.653
I thought it would be
something I could pawn

08:56.710 --> 08:58.007
but it's full of cash.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.006
And the guy who the bag
belongs to is after it

10:58.350 --> 10:59.385
They, them. I got you.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.171
If anybody gives you
any trouble,

11:01.220 --> 11:02.266
you let me know.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.565
All right.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.001
What's up with
all the matching Simba ink?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.140
Tattoo shop have a special
or something?

11:13.190 --> 11:14.964
We're the kings
of the jungle, baby.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.408
-Haven't you heard?
-Harris, let's go.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.055
CARTER: Don't worry.

11:19.110 --> 11:20.190
You'll have your own
soon enough.

11:21.590 --> 11:22.807
MINNICK: Boot.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.192
Move your ass.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.709
What is up with you?

11:25.770 --> 11:27.544
I got a girl in trouble.
One of mine.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.679
-One of yours?
-MINNICK: Former student.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.152
I've been helping her
get her life back on track

11:31.210 --> 11:32.507
for the last few months.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.811
She's really important to me

11:33.860 --> 11:35.680
and I'm not about
to lose anybody else.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.163
All right, lay it on me.

11:38.210 --> 11:39.609
Name's Isobel.
Called for help.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.424
-Now she's gone missing.
-What happened?

11:41.480 --> 11:42.822
She lifted a bag
she shouldn't have.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.996
Owner wants it back.

11:44.050 --> 11:45.733
He's got a gun
and he already used it.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.399
[elevator bell dings]

11:49.440 --> 11:51.226
Whatever it is, not now.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.223
You're gonna wanna see this.

11:54.270 --> 11:56.409
...the days of
a corrupt and lawless

11:56.450 --> 11:58.179
Sheriff's Department are over.

11:58.230 --> 11:59.538
No more insiders.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.013
It's time for a reformer.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.755
An agent of change,

12:02.800 --> 12:04.756
someone to come in
and clean house.

12:04.810 --> 12:07.768
So today, I humbly...

12:07.810 --> 12:10.449
announce my candidacy
for sheriff

12:10.510 --> 12:11.989
of Los Angeles County.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.768
-What are you thinking?
-I shoulda seen this coming.

12:15.820 --> 12:18.118
She'll destroy
everything we've worked for.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.468
Whatever you think of me, Bill,

12:20.520 --> 12:22.738
an outsider running
this department isn't right.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.259
This may be the first time

12:24.300 --> 12:25.733
I've ever agreed
with you, Jerry.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.429
Not about
you and me anymore.

12:29.130 --> 12:30.267
Never was.

12:41.930 --> 12:43.409
It was like this
when I came home.

12:43.450 --> 12:44.792
I mean, I went out for smokes

12:44.850 --> 12:46.329
and then I came back
and it was like this.

12:46.370 --> 12:47.803
I couldn't have been gone
more than 20 minutes.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.101
MINNICK:
You must be Josie.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.808
I'm Deputy Minnick.
This is Harris.

12:50.850 --> 12:51.896
We're looking for Isobel.

12:51.940 --> 12:54.158
Same. Look at my damn door.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.065
Something to do
with her, I know.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.634
Someone's after her.
We need to find her first.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.420
Minnick?

13:00.470 --> 13:01.596
You're the one tutors Isobel

13:01.650 --> 13:02.981
at the library, aren't you?

13:03.470 --> 13:04.949
Yeah, she talks
about you a lot.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.297
So who did this then?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.339
Yeah, I'm not sure.

13:07.390 --> 13:08.425
Is anything missing?

13:08.480 --> 13:09.822
Yeah, I'm outta weed.

13:10.310 --> 13:11.823
Okay, what about a phone?

13:11.870 --> 13:13.690
The guy we're after
was tracking her on it.

13:14.220 --> 13:15.300
No.

13:18.660 --> 13:19.649
Who are you?

13:20.230 --> 13:21.834
Uh, Tina.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.142
Uh, Isobel's friend.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.660
We got separated.
I thought she'd be here.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.929
If Isobel's in trouble, you can
bet this one's mixed up in it.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.140
TINA: Yeah, no one
asked you, Josie.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.531
Why don't you
go back to collecting

13:31.590 --> 13:33.148
your disability checks
and shut the hell up?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.151
Get out of my house.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.508
No one asked you to be here.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.801
Okay, show me her room.

13:50.610 --> 13:52.692
[dogs barking]

13:55.700 --> 13:56.735
I found her phone.

14:00.620 --> 14:01.837
This must be the burner.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.701
I was the one who told Izzy
to grab the bag.

14:07.230 --> 14:08.276
It's my fault.

14:09.710 --> 14:10.574
Helluva home life.

14:10.630 --> 14:11.847
Yeah, Izzy caught Josie

14:11.890 --> 14:13.710
as her foster mom
a couple years back.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.318
Josie wanted a check
from the state.

14:15.370 --> 14:16.758
Izzy wanted a guardian
that wasn't gonna ask

14:16.810 --> 14:18.061
too many questions.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.238
-She's smart and hardworking.
-Like you.

14:21.730 --> 14:22.674
Yeah, not even that.

14:22.730 --> 14:24.027
I mean,
it's hard for a girl

14:24.080 --> 14:26.207
who gets cycled
through the system to trust,

14:26.250 --> 14:27.899
but she was brave enough
to do that with me.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.554
I was helping her with her GED.

14:30.910 --> 14:31.899
We're gonna find her.

14:33.430 --> 14:35.864
Last thing I told my students
before I left for Sheriff's,

14:35.910 --> 14:38.993
"Something bad happens, find me,
and I'll find you."

14:39.050 --> 14:41.006
-That's what she did.
-Yeah, but it's too late.

14:41.050 --> 14:43.223
If she'd have called me sooner,
I could have prevented this.

14:43.270 --> 14:44.999
All right, you rewrite
the past later.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.096
We gotta find her now.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.391
So where are we going?

14:48.270 --> 14:49.316
HOJ.

14:49.930 --> 14:50.965
Get this to Bishop.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.271
[dog barking]

14:54.320 --> 14:56.402
[intense music playing]

14:59.940 --> 15:01.976
Where you at, huh?
Where you at?

15:03.680 --> 15:04.760
Come on, come on.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.419
[helicopter hovering]

15:08.690 --> 15:10.760
[dog barking]

15:14.170 --> 15:15.250
[grunts]

15:16.520 --> 15:18.738
She's somewhere around
Eastern and Washington.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.304
Put everybody out there.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.079
Dead or alive.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.048
I don't care.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.523
I just need that money.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.442
Found this in
Isobel's apartment.

15:29.490 --> 15:30.969
Belongs to the guy
who's after her.

15:31.010 --> 15:31.965
You think you can
get something off of it?

15:32.010 --> 15:33.136
Of course.

15:33.190 --> 15:34.407
Hey, is this about
that missing girl?

15:34.450 --> 15:35.439
Isobel. Yeah.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.017
Okay.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.803
[beeping]

15:46.030 --> 15:47.065
Look at this.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.803
The only photo
on the hard drive

15:48.860 --> 15:50.669
is the money bag.

15:50.730 --> 15:52.595
It was texted
to these two numbers.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.643
And those are registered to...

15:55.690 --> 15:56.907
-[key clacks]
-[beeps]

15:58.650 --> 16:00.345
...Corey Edison and Adam Kemp.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.641
CADE: Are you serious?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.861
Edison and Kemp are guns
for Los Cuchillos.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.731
Is that a tag?

16:07.660 --> 16:09.878
CADE
No, that's their mark,
a dragon tattoo.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.569
Where did Isobel get this bag?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.579
[keyboard keys clacking]

16:14.840 --> 16:17.308
Whoa. That's a DMZ
for gang affiliates.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.009
They must have started
doing deals there.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.789
MINNICK:
So she stole that bag

16:20.840 --> 16:22.842
and got herself
in the middle of something big.

16:22.890 --> 16:24.107
Sure she isn't signed up?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.196
MINNICK:
No, she's straight.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.457
No gangs.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.888
She pushed that life away.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.116
I think Isobel didn't know
who she was stealing from.

16:31.160 --> 16:34.209
055 has a shot caller
in custody from Los Cuchillos.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.331
CRI. George.
He might be willing to talk.

16:37.380 --> 16:38.597
Oh, he'll talk.

16:41.040 --> 16:41.995
Let's do it.

16:45.430 --> 16:47.648
PAULA: They're both
just so strong-headed.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.123
Maggie's gonna grow up,
whether Bill likes it or not.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.819
ANJELICA:
Your father couldn't stand it
when you started dating.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.008
You know, there's something
about men and daughters.

16:56.050 --> 16:57.654
Why didn't he come?

16:57.710 --> 16:59.792
Oh, he'll come, he'll come when
the rest of the family comes.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.534
You know, he's enjoying
his quiet life now.

17:05.110 --> 17:07.977
Besides, I wanted
a head start with you, honey.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.322
I wanna maximize
mother-daughter time.

17:11.370 --> 17:13.281
Because you're
worried about me.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.599
Mothers never stop worrying.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.022
You should realize that now.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.726
Doctors shouldn't bring
work home with them.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.206
There's no patients here.

17:25.260 --> 17:27.558
Mom, it's been a long time

17:27.610 --> 17:29.339
since my job only involved
helping patients.

17:29.390 --> 17:31.039
I mean, right now
I'm just focused

17:31.740 --> 17:33.696
on saving jobs and,
to be honest, I'm just...

17:33.740 --> 17:35.526
I'm not... I'm not even
doing it too well.

17:35.570 --> 17:36.878
[sighs]

17:36.920 --> 17:37.909
All right.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.049
Talk to your mama.
What's wrong?

17:40.100 --> 17:41.749
It's my responsibility
to make sure

17:41.790 --> 17:44.441
that these hospital budget cuts
don't turn into layoffs.

17:44.490 --> 17:47.573
And so far,
I've only saved one.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.458
My options are
just fire ten nurses,

17:50.500 --> 17:53.060
one of whom is
a year away from retirement,

17:53.110 --> 17:56.193
or just slash geriatrics
and outsource radiology.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.196
It's just,
it's a no-win scenario

17:58.250 --> 18:00.593
and I should have done it sooner
but I was just so...

18:00.640 --> 18:02.631
-Traumatized.
-Distracted.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.248
What does your father
always say?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.389
If you have a problem,
you're not--

18:07.430 --> 18:10.388
...looking at the situation
from the right direction.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.419
Mm-hmm.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.902
All right.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.348
Need to change perspective.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.608
I've been focused on

18:18.660 --> 18:20.480
how to save money
when I...

18:22.310 --> 18:24.483
I should have been focused
on how to raise money.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.964
You're a genius.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.106
You got a solid rep
with 055, George.

18:34.150 --> 18:36.459
Now, we're hoping some intel
made its way down to you.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.411
A civilian stumbled upon
a bag full of cash

18:38.460 --> 18:40.633
that belonged to Los Cuchillos.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.280
At least, it went down
on their turf.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.332
Nothin'?

18:48.380 --> 18:50.336
Are you livin' comfortable
in here, George?

18:51.210 --> 18:52.336
So all that can all go away,

18:52.390 --> 18:53.812
if you don't start
getting talkative.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.608
MINNICK:
This is Isobel.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.174
Seventeen.
Ward of the state.

19:00.220 --> 19:02.825
She picked up that bag,
but she didn't know what it was.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.300
Don't know her.

19:06.050 --> 19:07.096
Don't know you.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.669
Ain't my business.

19:10.230 --> 19:12.835
You do you know her
though, right? Maria.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.012
Your little girl.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.584
You lost her
four years back.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.589
Yeah, I did my homework.

19:19.890 --> 19:22.324
You know, I came in here
with a lot of sympathy for you.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.155
Respect even.

19:25.590 --> 19:27.672
Someone had helped her,
maybe she'd be with us today.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.593
We are not here
to blow up your spot.

19:31.340 --> 19:32.819
Or to take down your crew.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.385
I'm just wanna remove
an innocent from a situation

19:35.430 --> 19:36.556
before it's too late.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.513
Do not let what happened
to Maria happen to Isobel.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.870
Look, I heard they're out
looking for someone,

19:47.440 --> 19:48.828
took a big stash from him.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.040
JOSEPH: Who's him?

19:52.800 --> 19:53.869
Tony.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.279
Enforcer.

19:58.890 --> 20:01.051
Maybe trying to come up
since I been on the inside.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.544
He was with Los Cuchillos,

20:05.420 --> 20:06.899
but he does_
some out5ide busmess.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.191
How do we find him?

20:08.770 --> 20:10.374
I don't know how to
find that fool, all right?

20:11.250 --> 20:12.729
But I know a couple dudes
that work with him.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.239
All right.

20:15.560 --> 20:16.595
Names and numbers.

20:24.260 --> 20:25.568
[footsteps approaching]

20:26.480 --> 20:27.868
[knock on door]

20:27.920 --> 20:29.694
Twice in one day, Sheriff.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.138
[scoffs] And to think
you've been so hard

20:31.180 --> 20:32.522
to lock down until now.

20:32.570 --> 20:34.526
Well, getting played
doesn't make me shy.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.093
How exactly...

20:37.010 --> 20:38.534
did I play you?

20:38.580 --> 20:40.354
You knew you were
announcing for my job

20:40.410 --> 20:41.536
when we met this morning.

20:41.580 --> 20:42.922
Why not give me the heads-up?

20:42.980 --> 20:44.459
Must've slipped my mind.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.400
See, I think this is
all just a game to you.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.619
Well, I'm here to tell you
that my department

20:48.680 --> 20:50.454
and the lives of the people
who work here

20:50.510 --> 20:52.239
are not chess pieces,
Miss Riley.

20:52.290 --> 20:53.450
RILEY:
I never said they were.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.410
I've just become aware

20:55.470 --> 20:58.428
_of inconsistencies
in leadership ethics

20:58.860 --> 21:03.126
and I feel that my brand of
unison, cohesion, and efficiency

21:03.170 --> 21:04.421
could do wonders here.

21:04.950 --> 21:07.475
Nepotism and cowboy diplomacy

21:07.520 --> 21:09.385
have no place
in a Sheriff's Department,

21:09.440 --> 21:10.657
I'm sure you would agree.

21:10.700 --> 21:11.997
Personally,

21:12.050 --> 21:14.484
I got a soft spot
for cowboy diplomacy.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.961
[scoffs]

21:16.010 --> 21:18.001
But with nepotism, we agree.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.614
Fortunately,
that's not what this was.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.570
Deputy Harris was right.

21:22.620 --> 21:25.623
LAPD was pinning a murder
on an innocent man.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.537
Here's how I see it.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.492
You're letting
a corrupt police officer walk

21:31.550 --> 21:33.199
for your own political benefit

21:33.240 --> 21:35.845
as you aim to run a department
that you've never worked in

21:35.900 --> 21:37.765
and you think
you can do it better

21:37.810 --> 21:39.414
than all the people
who've climbed their way up

21:39.470 --> 21:40.414
from the inside.

21:40.470 --> 21:43.200
Think of me as the antidote

21:43.250 --> 21:45.332
to a systemic cancer

21:45.390 --> 21:47.813
of complacency
and backwards leadership

21:47.870 --> 21:50.771
that promotes dissent amongst
our law enforcement agencies.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.344
I am gonna unite this county

21:53.390 --> 21:57.303
because_ the time
of renegade justice is over.

21:58.090 --> 22:00.354
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.651
[cell phone buzzing]

22:03.270 --> 22:05.830
Sorry, you and I, we're done.

22:06.710 --> 22:09.361
The Johnson case, however,
is far from over.

22:10.190 --> 22:11.532
-Thanks for stopping by.
-[buzzing continues]

22:15.550 --> 22:16.767
Yeah. What's up?

22:17.420 --> 22:18.546
Need your help, Sheriff.

22:31.430 --> 22:32.681
[tires screeching]

22:38.310 --> 22:39.345
[tires screech]

22:45.710 --> 22:46.699
[panﬁng]

22:51.100 --> 22:52.704
[cell phone ringing]

22:55.060 --> 22:56.368
What damn it?

22:56.410 --> 22:57.399
No, I haven't.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.677
But if I do,
I swear to God

22:58.720 --> 22:59.971
I'll kill her myself.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.244
Yeah, damn straight.

23:02.290 --> 23:03.325
[door buzzing]

23:05.730 --> 23:07.334
Hey, come here.
Where you going?

23:09.560 --> 23:12.028
Give me back my bag,
bitch!

23:12.080 --> 23:13.069
Aah!

23:15.740 --> 23:16.957
Yeah, you keep runnin'.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.911
You really think you can win?

23:22.960 --> 23:25.133
Against Hollister,
we'll see.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.045
Against you, easily.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.909
Never were one to pull punches.

23:28.970 --> 23:32.224
Well, my dad always said,
"If you're gonna punch, punch."

23:32.280 --> 23:33.702
Okay, how's this?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.443
You're just a suit, Carol.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.400
You don't know the first thing
about running this department.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.327
Bow out now
before you get burned.

23:39.370 --> 23:40.621
RILEY:
There you go, Jerry.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.931
Although, one might argue

23:41.980 --> 23:43.538
that an outsider's
perspective

23:43.590 --> 23:46.286
is exactly what this
old boys' club needs.

23:46.330 --> 23:48.286
Less ego, more results.

23:48.940 --> 23:50.077
How's that for a suit?

23:50.120 --> 23:51.894
Perhaps I'm underestimating you.

23:51.950 --> 23:53.906
-Most men do.
-We have a common cause.

23:53.950 --> 23:54.939
Hollister?

23:54.990 --> 23:56.252
Nah, he's more of an obstacle

23:56.300 --> 23:57.551
the way I see it.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.339
We could remove
that obstacle together.

23:59.390 --> 24:01.950
I've got plenty of ammunition
against you both.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.309
And besides, Jerry,
haven't you heard?

24:05.530 --> 24:07.134
The future is female.

24:14.490 --> 24:16.538
CADE:
There's no movement on
that black Suburban yet.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.663
-Let me ask you something.
-CADE: Hmm.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.530
Say your daughter has a boy
come over for lunch.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.539
She's eight.

24:26.330 --> 24:28.150
Okay. Well, add six years,

24:28.200 --> 24:29.758
and then imagine he comes over.

24:29.810 --> 24:31.459
His name's Wyatt.

24:31.510 --> 24:33.159
Ooh. Boyfriend?

24:33.730 --> 24:34.810
Looks that way.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.297
I mean, you throw
a warning shot over the bow.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.126
You tell him what's what, right?

24:40.170 --> 24:42.638
[laughs] Had a few
of those when I was a kid.

24:43.260 --> 24:44.295
Me, too.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.772
Any of 'em stick?

24:45.830 --> 24:46.819
Nope.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.953
-You?
-[scoffs]

24:49.000 --> 24:50.342
Maggie wanted me to stand down,

24:52.750 --> 24:55.310
You know, you don't have kids,
you're living for today.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.225
You add kids,
and everything...

24:57.930 --> 24:58.999
Everything matters.

25:00.670 --> 25:02.490
JOSEPH:
You really think she's
out on the street right now?

25:03.450 --> 25:05.054
MINNICK: Nope,
she's too smart for that.

25:05.110 --> 25:07.328
But Sheriff and Cade
are sitting on that house,

25:07.370 --> 25:09.235
so we're out here
thinking on 'it.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.630
"Thinking on it"?

25:11.680 --> 25:13.409
I think better when I drive.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.500
You do, too.
You just don't know it yet.

25:17.030 --> 25:19.203
And if Tony doesn't
have Isobel yet,

25:19.690 --> 25:20.987
then his only chance
at finding her

25:21.040 --> 25:22.985
is bringing in reinforcements.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.508
If they move,
then they take us to her.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.869
Or him.
Either way it's a win.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.645
She was luclq
to have a teacher like you.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.213
Yeah, it goes both ways.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.302
We gotta get ahead of Tony.

25:37.050 --> 25:39.393
Figure out where Isobel would go
if she wanted to be safe.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.834
Why doesn't she just go
to the nearest police station

25:41.880 --> 25:42.926
and have them call you?

25:42.970 --> 25:44.449
She stole that bag.

25:44.890 --> 25:47.233
There's no way she's bringing
anybody in law side

25:47.280 --> 25:48.497
if it isn't me.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.894
-MAN [on phone] What's up?
-TONY: Yo. I got her.

25:56.940 --> 25:58.111
MAN [on phone]:
For real?

25:58.160 --> 25:59.195
TONY:
Get everybody over

25:59.250 --> 26:00.547
to the Caldas Library now.

26:06.910 --> 26:08.423
All right,
we got movement.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.125
[car engine starts]

26:18.090 --> 26:19.079
[tires skidding]

26:22.010 --> 26:24.706

26:24.750 --> 26:26.615

Target on the move.
Black Suburban.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.706
License plate three-two-five
Papa-Charlie-Echo.

26:28.760 --> 26:29.704
Heading south on Nicholas.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.102
They must have eyes
on Isobel.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.583
-Where are they going?
-I don't know.

26:32.630 --> 26:33.881
What's East on Clark?

26:33.940 --> 26:35.407
If we knew that,
we could beat them there.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.711
Caldas Library.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.102
That's where I study with her
on Sundays.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.242
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.724
Hey, Sheriff, they're headed
to Caldas Library.

26:42.770 --> 26:43.850
Meet you there.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.073
I need an airship.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.293
And I need an ETA on OSS.

26:50.340 --> 26:53.958
Airship is en route
and OSS is six minutes out.

26:54.650 --> 26:55.639
Yeah, copy that.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.048
[intense music playing]

[cart wheels squeaking]

27:42.440 --> 27:43.919
-Get out of my way.
-Hey!

27:55.540 --> 27:58.145
MINNICK:
Folks, I need you to get up
quickly and quietly.

27:58.190 --> 27:59.885
Follow the deputy
behind the counter.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.363
Quickly. Thank you.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.362
Sir? Come on. Let's go.

28:19.870 --> 28:21.212
This doesn't look good.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.926
We just got made.

Everybody, right this way.
Don't panic.

28:45.460 --> 28:46.757
-Everybody keep calm.
-Everybody stay calm.

28:46.810 --> 28:47.936
Sheriff's Department
is on the scene.

28:47.980 --> 28:49.026

29:59.310 --> 30:00.789
Whatcha gonna do with that?

30:00.840 --> 30:02.262
You ever shot somebody?

30:02.320 --> 30:03.662
'Cause I have.

30:03.710 --> 30:04.745
Izzy.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.831
Dude's not worth it.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.845
-He's trying to kill me.
-MINNICK: I know.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.802
But what you do right now,
that's on you.

30:15.370 --> 30:16.849
We can end this today.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.025
Your entire future
dies with him.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.036
[Isobel crying]

30:25.080 --> 30:26.809
Been stealing just to get by.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.329
Doesn't have to be like that.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.036
You got a couple weeks
until your GED.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.865
That's gonna open up
a lot of doors for you.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.828
I don't want this life.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.529
Put down the gun.

30:51.370 --> 30:52.530

-Oh!
-Yes!

[Cade clears throat]

31:41.940 --> 31:42.929
-Hey-hey.
-Hey!

31:42.980 --> 31:44.322
-What's up, buddy?
-Hey.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.116
I'll take that.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.941
So, uh, how'd it go?

31:51.990 --> 31:53.207
The kids had a great time.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.514
-And Camilla, too?
-Camilla, too.

31:56.470 --> 31:57.607
[indistinct]

31:58.130 --> 31:59.256
It's great to hear.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.949
Carmen said to thank you again.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.251
It really meant
the world to her

32:02.310 --> 32:04.119
to get to spend time
with her grandkids.

32:04.180 --> 32:05.477
That's great. Thank you.

32:05.530 --> 32:06.918
Just doing my job.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.780
Speaking of which,
I'm late for an interview.

32:08.830 --> 32:10.229
Call you tomorrow
with the full download?

32:10.270 --> 32:11.259
Yeah, sounds good.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.833
All right. Bye, kids.

32:12.880 --> 32:13.926
-Bye.
-Bye.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.146
So?

32:16.190 --> 32:17.748
CADE: SO...

32:17.800 --> 32:18.971
you had fun?

32:19.020 --> 32:20.408
ROBERTO:
Yeah, it was great.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.621
We watched Disney Plus
and she made chilaquiles.

32:22.670 --> 32:24.490
-Aw.
-[|aughs] I love chilaquiles.

32:24.550 --> 32:25.756
Hey, Camilla, uh,
where's your elephant?

32:25.810 --> 32:26.799
Did you forget Snuffy?

32:26.850 --> 32:27.976
CAMILLA:
Snuffy's at Grandma's.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.247
He's gonna live there

32:29.290 --> 32:30.803
so I'll get to play
with him next week.

32:30.860 --> 32:32.111
Next week?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.684
Grandma said we're gonna
see her all the time.

32:33.730 --> 32:34.810
Is that cool?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.120
TERESA: Uh...

32:41.910 --> 32:43.958
[soft music playing]

32:50.350 --> 32:51.487
What happens now?

32:52.840 --> 32:55.058
Well, the detectives
will ask you some questions

32:55.660 --> 32:56.831
but I'll be there with you.

32:57.190 --> 32:58.669
Am I going to jail?

32:59.490 --> 33:01.799
MINNICK: Tony was a bad man
and that money was tainted.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.319
You don't need to worry
about going to jail.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.146
-What you need to worry about--
-You don't need to tell me.

33:06.590 --> 33:07.716
Tell you what?

33:08.420 --> 33:11.025
I need to start
earning back my integrity.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.028
I know I do.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.150
[chuckles]

33:14.680 --> 33:15.988
Is that what I was gonna say?

33:16.510 --> 33:18.853
"Real integrity
is doing the right thing,

33:18.900 --> 33:20.640
"knowing that
nobody's gonna know

33:20.690 --> 33:22.169
-whether you did it or not."
-"...did it or not."

33:23.560 --> 33:25.118
And what's that?

33:25.170 --> 33:27.695
It's that Oprah quote
you used to start class with.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.048
Look at you

33:29.090 --> 33:30.910
remembering every word.

33:31.530 --> 33:33.782
I remember everything
you told us.

33:34.270 --> 33:37.000
I didn't know what integrity
was before I met you.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.271
I'm gonna do better.

33:43.410 --> 33:44.445
Starting right now.

33:46.630 --> 33:48.018
And I'm gonna help you.

34:00.210 --> 34:01.893
[horse nickers]

34:04.080 --> 34:05.297
BILL:
It's been too long.

34:08.390 --> 34:10.426
I'm sorry, Mags, I really am.

34:12.220 --> 34:14.302
I should've handled that
differently with Wyatt.

34:15.090 --> 34:16.398
I got protective

34:17.570 --> 34:19.128
instead of being trusting

34:19.920 --> 34:21.444
of you and your decisions.

34:23.010 --> 34:24.056
Thanks, Dad.

34:24.670 --> 34:25.739
[sighs deeply]

34:26.450 --> 34:27.929
I've been thinking about it...

34:28.450 --> 34:30.179
and I can't imagine
what it must be like

34:30.240 --> 34:31.719
watching a child grow up.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.931
Hard.

34:34.370 --> 34:35.587
[sighs] There are days
I wish I could slow it down.

34:35.630 --> 34:36.972
But I can't.

34:38.770 --> 34:39.805
I'm getting older.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.112
I'm almost 15.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.466
I need to be able
to have boys in my life

34:44.510 --> 34:46.637
who aren't completely
afraid of you.

34:46.690 --> 34:48.988
A little afraid of me
is okay though, right?

34:50.610 --> 34:52.032
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.690
I do need you to give Wyatt
another chance though.

34:59.270 --> 35:00.214
For me.

35:00.270 --> 35:01.658
Whoa.

35:02.310 --> 35:04.005
I'd do anything for you, honey.

35:04.050 --> 35:05.312
'Course I will.

35:07.270 --> 35:09.090
You're just growing up so fast.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.228
I get scared.

35:11.280 --> 35:12.315
Sorry.

35:20.550 --> 35:22.279
Yo. You been here all night?

35:22.330 --> 35:24.286
I came in early.
I wanted to clear the inbox.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.469
Yeah, I get diving into work
after a breakup.

35:26.510 --> 35:28.114
But you're taking time
for yourself though, right?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.593
Trying to at least.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.949
If you ever wanna get
in the water, give me a shout.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.514
I'll take you for a surf.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.039
There's no better way
for clearing your head.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.297
Thanks, Cade.

35:36.350 --> 35:38.306
Yeah, I, uh, I might
take you up on that.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.046
[door opens]

35:44.310 --> 35:45.356
You wanted to see me?

35:46.310 --> 35:47.390
Yeah, sit.

35:49.010 --> 35:50.830
I sent some deputies over to

35:51.710 --> 35:53.758
pick up Isobel's
former foster mother.

35:55.930 --> 35:59.752
Think it's safe to say
she's not part of
the system anymore.

36:00.940 --> 36:02.157
Well, that's good to hear.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.500
How many years
were you a teacher?

36:05.030 --> 36:07.157
Six. Why?

36:07.200 --> 36:09.760
Wanted to know how long
it takes for someone to know.

36:10.950 --> 36:12.201
To know what?

36:12.250 --> 36:13.899
To know exactly
what a kid needs.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.996
What to say or do,

36:17.040 --> 36:18.348
how hard to push.

36:19.780 --> 36:20.826
It's a gift.

36:20.870 --> 36:22.303
I don't know about a gift.

36:22.350 --> 36:23.829
I was just doing my job.

36:23.870 --> 36:25.861
I don't think you've ever
just done anything.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.694
That's why I wanted to see you.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.226
I've been going through
this mountain

36:31.270 --> 36:34.137
of Sheriff Bradford's
unfinished paperwork...

36:34.970 --> 36:36.881
and it seems you're due
for a promotion.

36:36.930 --> 36:38.227
Yeah, well, I don't think
Sheriff Bradford--

36:38.280 --> 36:41.010
Which isn't why
I'm offering one to you.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.368
In my short time here,

36:43.410 --> 36:45.196
I've seen more than enough.

36:45.240 --> 36:48.061
Selflessness and initiative...

36:49.070 --> 36:51.197
that some don't manage
their entire career.

36:53.290 --> 36:54.848
So that's why I'd like
to offer you--

36:54.900 --> 36:55.855
MINNICK: Sir.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.208
I'm sorry.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.810
_ Idon't mean
to interrupt you, um...

37:00.780 --> 37:02.122
but I gotta be honest with you,

37:02.170 --> 37:03.899
I don't wanna know
what the promotion is.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.520
-Y_ou don't?
-I appreCIate it, of course.

37:06.570 --> 37:07.958
More than you know.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.428
But no matter what it is,
I'm gonna turn it down,

37:11.490 --> 37:13.742
so, the way I'm thinking,

37:13.790 --> 37:15.269
it's better not to know.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.924
And why would you turn it down?

37:17.490 --> 37:19.310
Because I wanna finish
what I started.

37:20.620 --> 37:21.666
And what's that?

37:22.500 --> 37:23.569
MINNICK:
Training Joseph.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.324
He's gonna be a great deputy.

37:26.980 --> 37:28.322
But the work
isn't finished yet.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.280
Like I said...

37:30.940 --> 37:32.498
you've never just done anything.

37:34.290 --> 37:36.110
Promotion's here
when you're ready.

37:37.210 --> 37:38.245
Thank you, sir.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.688
I owe you a second thank you.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.259
-For what?
-MINNICK:
For believing in me,

37:46.300 --> 37:48.086
for helping out with Isobel

37:48.130 --> 37:50.439
with no questions
and no conditions.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.780
That's all this is really about.

37:54.310 --> 37:55.356
The big wins...

37:57.230 --> 37:59.004
the unimaginable losses.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.744
We're here to help each other.

38:02.800 --> 38:06.622
Otherwise... _
we're just passm' time.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.954
Deputy Minnick.
There you are.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.695
I've got a new assignment
for you.

38:33.390 --> 38:34.732
This district attorney...

38:38.490 --> 38:39.787
You're not coming?

38:39.830 --> 38:41.001
MINNICK: I'm not.

38:41.490 --> 38:44.004
No. But thank you
for the invite.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.573
And the opportunity.
I appreciate it.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.009
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

38:49.370 --> 38:50.314
I think so.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.325
This isn't just an invite
to an open bar event.

38:55.370 --> 38:57.235
This is my way of saying
you'll have a place

38:57.290 --> 38:58.234
in my command structure.

38:58.290 --> 38:59.678
If you're elected.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.037
WhenI'm elected.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.860
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me

39:11.690 --> 39:13.646
and for the confidence
you have in me.

39:13.690 --> 39:15.385
But I've been doing
some soul searching

39:15.440 --> 39:16.862
and the thing I've come up with

39:16.910 --> 39:19.083
is that what I really wanna do,

39:19.610 --> 39:21.009
what I am going to do,

39:21.050 --> 39:22.358
is my job.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.482
And right now,
my job is to start a shift

39:25.530 --> 39:27.873
with a young deputy
that's in need of my guidance.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.358
I can't argue with you
wanting to do your job.

39:31.890 --> 39:32.925
I respect that.

39:35.930 --> 39:37.272
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.283
You're making
a very big mistake.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.246
District Attorney Riley
is running for sheriff now, too.

39:45.730 --> 39:47.675
She and Bill, regardless of
whether he's running or not

39:47.730 --> 39:49.027
will tear each other apart.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.559
And when the dust settles...

39:52.430 --> 39:54.079
I'll be the last man standing.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.086
At that point, you can
either stand beside me...

39:57.610 --> 39:58.645
or in my way.

40:00.740 --> 40:01.786
Yes, sir.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.702
[sighs]

40:08.750 --> 40:10.570
WOMAN [on phone]:
Mark Greenburg
from theLA Times

40:10.620 --> 40:12.406
-returning your call.
-Great. Thanks.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.407
Mark. Sheriff Hollister.

40:16.450 --> 40:19.055
I wanted to talk to you
about that LAPD detective

40:19.110 --> 40:20.759
the Sheriff's Department
arrested.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.149
Yeah, Detective Johnson,
that's him.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.674
Word on the street is
the DA's lookin' to cut a deal.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.290
How'd you like to hear
my side of the story?

40:35.210 --> 40:37.462
Volleyball tournament
in Venice tomorrow.

40:37.950 --> 40:40.418
-You are coming.
-Venice is my spot

40:40.480 --> 40:42.903
but volleyball is--
it's not my game.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.656
You're gonna miss out on
a lot of thirsty badge bunnies.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.600
Work comes first,
you know why?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.829
'Cause they're
the ones who pay.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.395
Exactly. So I will catch you
and your badge bunnies later.

40:54.530 --> 40:56.088
Are you sure this is
about work and not,

40:56.140 --> 40:57.619
I don't know, about Minnick?

40:58.230 --> 40:59.572
I get the feeling, like,

40:59.630 --> 41:01.621
there's something
going on between you two.

41:01.670 --> 41:02.750
JOSEPH: Yeah, well,
feelings are not facts.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.973
And there's definitely nothing.

41:05.810 --> 41:06.936
Carter.

41:06.980 --> 41:08.971
-Hi.
-Go home.

41:09.030 --> 41:10.065
Okay.

41:12.990 --> 41:15.379
-What?
-Watch out for that one.

41:15.860 --> 41:17.589
-I hear you.
-I don't want you to hear me.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.982
I want you to listen.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.420
Let's go.

41:30.270 --> 41:31.339
Hold on.

41:32.270 --> 41:33.305
What's up?

41:33.360 --> 41:34.520
Break down your shotgun.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.615
Really?

41:37.660 --> 41:39.218
Did I stutter?

41:40.410 --> 41:41.479
All right. Gotcha.

42:02.210 --> 42:03.859
Operable and patrol ready.

42:03.910 --> 42:04.945
All right.

42:05.780 --> 42:06.860
Do it again.

42:15.220 --> 42:17.393
Keep your eyes
on the street, Deputy.
