WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.466
Surprise!

00:21.605 --> 00:25.280
- Where are you going?
- To see the child that eats souls.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.949
In order to create the world,

00:28.153 --> 00:31.123
God had to give up his only kin.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.870
The Darkness.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.288
I was the beginning,
and I will be the end.

00:37.496 --> 00:38.793
We're bonded.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.125
She's the sister of God.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.840
- God...
- She picked you.

00:45.337 --> 00:49.183
You have to understand this
about The Darkness, she's relentless.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.851
It's the only reason
I came off the sidelines.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.224
Where on Earth are we gonna find
an answer on how to stop her?

00:53.470 --> 00:55.222
The Hand of God.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.322
Only Lucifer can beat Amara.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.524
Can you really beat her?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.154
- I can.
- Then yes.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.746
That's not Cass!

01:22.666 --> 01:23.883
Amara, no!

01:42.019 --> 01:43.612
Check on him.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.698
Hey.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.534
Chuck?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.204
Can you hear me?

01:57.576 --> 01:58.873
Dean.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.585
Cass? Hey, is that you?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.718
Hey, can you hear me? Hey.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.210
Oh!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.383
Lucifer is gone.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.716
Amara ripped him from my body.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.559
To where?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.269
I don't know.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.557
Come on.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.234
Are you, uh...

02:23.226 --> 02:24.899
How do you feel?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.313
Oh...

02:27.272 --> 02:29.741
You know when you're driving
and a bug hits your windshield?

02:31.568 --> 02:32.945
I'm the bug.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.749
- So what Amara said, about you...
- Dying.

02:39.242 --> 02:43.292
Yeah, whatever she did to me, I can feel
my spark, my light, fading.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.918
- But when it's gone...
- Okay, well, tell us how to fix you.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.586
You can't.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.260
I mean, I suppose she could. Maybe. But...

02:53.090 --> 02:54.850
That's never gonna happen.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.604
So that was a gun in your pocket.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.274
Well...

03:06.436 --> 03:10.782
That was a complete and utter
dog's breakfast, wasn't it?

03:12.317 --> 03:14.115
I didn't know dogs had breakfast.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.788
Cass is back.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.955
Just curious,
has anyone bothered to look outside?

03:48.311 --> 03:49.312
What is it?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.026
- It looks like the sun is...
- Dying.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.861
Why would Amara do that?

03:56.194 --> 03:58.822
The sun is the source
of all life on Earth.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.665
Without it, everything just...

04:01.658 --> 04:03.160
Just wastes away.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.337
Let's get the hell out of here.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.340
You.

04:12.544 --> 04:16.094
Still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
I'm not dead.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.425
- Oh, whoa! Okay. I got you.
- I should probably sit down.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.035
Yeah, come on.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.554
- Okay.
- What do we do now?

04:41.615 --> 04:42.787
Really?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.872
Really.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.250
What?

04:47.871 --> 04:50.044
We hit Amara with everything we got,

04:50.248 --> 04:52.546
and she walked it off, so...

04:52.751 --> 04:55.550
- So, it's last call?
- That's right.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.220
Look, man.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.553
If you got something for me to punch,
shoot, or kill,

05:02.719 --> 05:05.222
let me know, and I'll do it.
I'll do it till I die.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.146
But how are we supposed
to fix the frigging sun?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.128
Thank you, Reggie.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.772
Hello, hello?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.857
Ah, milady, let me.

05:54.104 --> 05:58.109
Anna, we've had this talk.
It's not "milady," it's Toni.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.988
Of course, milady.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.779
- Where's the boss?
- Down for his nap.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.662
- Tea's laid out in the study.
- Ah, thank God.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.633
Astronomers at the
Royal Observatory may have the answer.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.002
Dr. Nigel Pinfield explains.

06:17.210 --> 06:21.511
We have registered
a 6% drop in the sun's energy output.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.884
And yes, it happened quite suddenly.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.682
But people need to understand.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.474
Our sun goes through periods
of high activity and low activity.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.686
While this is somewhat unusual,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.146
there's certainly nothing to worry about.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.815
If only.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.490
Hello.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.163
No. I'm alone.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.873
What?

06:48.533 --> 06:49.705
Really?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.332
The bloody sun's cracked.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.839
Mmm-hmm.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.215
Mmm-hmm.

07:04.507 --> 07:08.182
With what's happening, are you sure
this is the wisest use of our resources?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.565
No. No, I understand.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.356
Yes, sir.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.904
On my way.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.415
Ah!

07:38.583 --> 07:41.063
You know what? This isn't gonna be enough.
I better make a run.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.010
No reason to die sober, huh? You want to?

07:45.548 --> 07:46.674
No.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.853
Charles, I'll put the kettle on.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.402
My mum always said, there's nothing
a nice wee cup of tea can't fix.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.525
I'll be right back.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.565
I'll stay here. Find our plan B.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.783
Okay. Cass, come on.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.032
Teapot?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.249
She's using you.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.577
It's what she does.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.413
Find someone with power,

08:17.998 --> 08:19.625
cozies up,

08:21.626 --> 08:23.845
digs her claws in.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.140
Yeah, well, I'm not helping anyone
right now.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.884
Obviously.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.183
She's been nice.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.558
For now.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.561
Now's kind of all we got.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.770
Whatever.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.361
I'm not calling you "Dad."

08:57.120 --> 08:58.963
You don't want to say goodbye?

08:59.414 --> 09:00.666
It's easier this way.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.756
Tell him I'll be home as soon as I can.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.879
How bad is it?

09:06.796 --> 09:07.797
All the way.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.426
Right.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.976
Packed you a little something.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.270
Just if all your mumbo jumbo doesn't work.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.317
Now Fergus was bright,
walked before his first birthday.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.116
But he hated pants. Hated them.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.329
He'd run around the village, his wee
banger just flapping in the breeze.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.865
Adam and Eve were the same way.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.243
Kids.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.167
I'm so glad the world is ending.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.255
Samantha.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.385
- What are we doing?
- Nothing.

09:49.631 --> 09:53.602
Exactly. Amara's out there eating
the freaking sun, and we're doing nothing.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.934
- And you have a better idea?
- Yes, anything.

09:57.180 --> 10:00.229
That's my better idea
because anything is better than this.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.852
Sam.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.402
I get it.

10:03.603 --> 10:07.528
Even if we could lock Amara away,
it wouldn't do any good now.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.027
I'm dying.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.864
And when I'm gone,

10:14.864 --> 10:17.287
the cosmic balance
between light and dark...

10:18.701 --> 10:20.328
It's over.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.630
All right.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.641
Then if we can't cage her,
we have to kill her.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.307
Bingo.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.612
How you doing? You good?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.408
I mean, you know, the whole Lucifer thing.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.620
I was just so stupid.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.370
No, no, no. It wasn't stupid.
You were right.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.747
You were right to let Lucifer
ride shotgun.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.919
Me and Sam wouldn't have done that.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.339
- Well, it didn't work.
- No, but it was our best shot.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.047
And you stepped up.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.842
I was just trying to help.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.341
Well, and you do help, Cass, you know.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.222
You know, sometimes, me and Sam,
we got so much going on

11:19.429 --> 11:22.228
that we forget about everyone else.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.735
Well, you do live exciting lives.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.608
Yeah, that's one word for it.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.782
But you're always there, you know.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.363
You're the best friend we've ever had.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.665
You're our brother, Cass.
I want you to know that.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.298
Thank you.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.302
Yo.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.261
All right, we're on our way.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.639
Sam's got something.

12:05.683 --> 12:08.027
Wait, so now you wanna kill The Darkness?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.599
You're cool with this?
Because, you know, last time...

12:11.731 --> 12:13.233
Look, Chuck's dying.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.277
Uh...

12:16.486 --> 12:19.581
- No offense, God.
- Yeah, no. I'm dying.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.328
So we don't really have a choice.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.955
I mean, look.
You've got darkness and light.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.457
You take one side away...

12:25.662 --> 12:27.960
That upsets the scales,
the whole balance of the universe.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.919
Exactly. But you take both away,
and now both sides of the scale are empty.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.628
- So...
- Of course. It's balanced.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.304
Right. Yes, okay. Uh...

12:35.505 --> 12:37.473
And look, hey, I'm game.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.968
But how exactly are we gonna do this?

12:40.176 --> 12:44.932
I mean, Lucifer hit her with a Hand of God
and, well, we saw how that turned out.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.149
Yeah.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.648
She does seem
impossible to destroy.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.020
Right.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.024
Is she, Chuck?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.859
Well...

12:57.819 --> 13:00.197
I mean, well, I...

13:01.281 --> 13:02.658
- Chuck.
- Charles.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.076
All right. Fine.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.331
The Darkness might,
might have a weakness.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.499
Light.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.967
He tells us now?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.591
What? I just wanted to trap her,
I didn't wanna murder her.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.175
Okay, but now that we're trying to end
her, how much light are we talking about?

13:20.383 --> 13:21.555
I don't know.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.136
Ten thousand suns.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.808
Set to supernova.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.393
Well, you're God.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.854
So, just God them up.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.904
Look at me.
I'm not in the best shape right now.

13:33.187 --> 13:37.067
Okay, that's all right.
We just need other ideas. Um...

13:37.942 --> 13:40.240
Rowena. What about the Book of the Damned?

13:41.529 --> 13:43.952
- This is beyond...
- Okay. Crowley?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.872
- Oh, I got nothing.
- Well, what about souls?

13:47.076 --> 13:50.797
They fuel your demon deals. Souls are
living batteries, they're full of energy.

13:50.997 --> 13:55.298
They're full of light.
Each one is as powerful as 100 suns?

13:55.501 --> 13:56.798
He's not wrong.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.097
Okay, so if we got this kind of juice,
then what?

13:59.297 --> 14:01.265
You get me enough souls...

14:03.009 --> 14:05.979
- I can build a bomb.
- Would that do the trick?

14:06.679 --> 14:07.680
Uh...

14:08.598 --> 14:10.771
- Maybe.
- All right. Plan B.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.041
- Okay, how many souls we talking here?
- The more the better.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.274
Even if you could get
that kind of firepower...

14:18.024 --> 14:19.526
You really think it would work?

14:19.776 --> 14:20.976
I can ask the angels.

14:21.319 --> 14:24.038
- Heaven is full of souls.
- Okay. What else we got?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.615
Ghosts.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.245
I mean, they're just souls
with baggage, right?

14:27.450 --> 14:30.294
Yeah, but we would need
a whole lot of them.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.540
Waverly Hills.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.636
Waverly Hills Sanatorium. Of course.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.422
Thousands died there.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.386
- Ton of ghosts.
- This is desperate. And stupid.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.020
Well, desperate and stupid's pretty much
all we got right now, so...

14:48.221 --> 14:49.268
Fine.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.895
I'll go raid Hell. See what's left.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.643
All right.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.854
Let's get to work.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.787
You really think this is gonna work?

15:49.991 --> 15:52.210
- Well, Rowena said it would.
- Oh! Yeah.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.330
"It's a Book of the Damned spell, boyos.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.883
"You take this wee crystal,
it will suck up all the blimey ghosts.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.544
"Just say the magic word."

16:23.983 --> 16:25.735
The place really lives up to the hype.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.495
Yes, it does.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.576
Let's give the magic word a shot
because we're six.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.801
All right, let's bust some ghosts.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.737
Where the heck are they?

17:02.063 --> 17:03.280
You got me.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.116
Get your Casper asses out here.

17:11.446 --> 17:12.790
You know what?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.951
Why don't you finish up,
I'll go piss them off.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.285
Yeah.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.986
Okay, I think it worked.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.078
A-ha!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.872
Say the magic word.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.948
Dean, hurry.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.824
Haggis!

18:48.002 --> 18:50.050
Go magic word. Huh.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.505
Yeah.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.702
The angels are... Heaven won't help.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.982
They know that this is the end, right?
Of everything?

19:15.071 --> 19:16.948
- Yes.
- And they don't care?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.658
No, it's not that. It's...

19:20.076 --> 19:23.751
They know God is dying,
and they don't think we can win this.

19:23.954 --> 19:28.505
Souls or no souls. They're sealing Heaven,
and they're, quote, "Dying with dignity."

19:29.627 --> 19:31.550
- Well, that's awesome.
- All right, Crowley, what about you?

19:31.754 --> 19:34.194
- Well, I had all the souls we need.
- What do you mean "had"?

19:34.256 --> 19:39.057
While I was indisposed, a few of my
pals decided to raid my stash.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.932
Well, what we have, it's not enough.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.645
Well, that could be nothing but good news.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.678
Nice digs.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.138
Billie?

20:15.840 --> 20:16.966
Who's Billie?

20:17.174 --> 20:20.223
Reaper. Wants us dead. Tons of fun.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.066
Hey.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.780
Wait a second. How did...

20:32.231 --> 20:33.699
What are you doing here?

20:33.941 --> 20:37.866
I saw you boys at Waverly Hills,
and call me a curious kitten,

20:38.070 --> 20:42.166
but with, you know,
the credits about to roll, gotta ask.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.370
- Why you boys busting ghosts?
- What do you care?

20:46.537 --> 20:49.006
Dead folks. Kind of my thing.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.376
So, spill.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.220
We're collecting souls to build a bomb.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.226
To blow The Darkness to Hell.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.227
Okay.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.444
"Okay"? What does that mean, "Okay"?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.072
Means, the way things are going,

21:13.355 --> 21:15.949
I'm about an hour away
from reaping God himself.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.487
So you're here to help us?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.073
Little tip.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.742
You want souls,

21:24.742 --> 21:26.085
call a reaper.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.543
Hiya.

21:35.753 --> 21:36.925
Hello.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.967
Oh, I like your dress.

21:42.259 --> 21:46.355
It's pretty fancy for the park,
but at least you made an effort.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.275
Do you wanna feed them?

21:53.103 --> 21:54.320
I shouldn't.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.866
I've been feeding these birds
going on 20 years now.

22:01.362 --> 22:02.955
They're practically family.

22:03.489 --> 22:07.244
And I know that makes me
sound like a crazy old bat, but...

22:08.285 --> 22:09.411
Heck.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.749
My husband died a couple of years ago,

22:13.082 --> 22:17.713
and my son keeps slipping me these
brochures for retirement communities,

22:18.671 --> 22:24.019
AKA where they send old folks to die,
but not to make a fuss about it.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.387
So you hate him.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.106
Well, a little bit.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.646
Sometimes.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.694
But you know family.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.859
Even when you hate them,
you still love them.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.246
Well, this is exciting.

23:11.473 --> 23:14.818
- How many souls are in there?
- Couple hundred thousand.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.072
I raided the Veil.

23:18.272 --> 23:22.322
Like I said. Dead folks, kind of my thing.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.576
- We good?
- Very.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.001
Super.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.087
See you around.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.414
Yeah. You will.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.667
Just hope it's not today.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.257
Crowley.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.558
So what now?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.357
Well, now we have the bomb,
so we just gotta find Amara.

23:53.724 --> 23:54.850
I can track her.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.811
She's not warded anymore.

23:57.019 --> 24:00.114
Why would she be? She won.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.692
Okay. so?

24:03.901 --> 24:09.158
We need somebody to get close to her.
Someone with a personal connection.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.088
Well, what are we waiting for?

24:25.547 --> 24:26.799
How do I smuggle this thing?

24:27.007 --> 24:29.055
- We could always shove it up your...
- Hey.

24:29.426 --> 24:30.894
I mean, you could.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.975
You won't carry the bomb.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.897
You'll be the bomb.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.488
I'm gonna take what's in there

24:42.731 --> 24:44.404
and put it in here.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.033
Once you get close to her,

24:48.696 --> 24:51.290
you press your fingers together, like so.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.668
Boom.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.795
Okay.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.784
Dean, are you okay?

25:32.656 --> 25:33.976
How do you feel?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.706
Like my insides just got flame broiled.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.626
Is that normal?

25:40.831 --> 25:42.959
Sweetie, we're so far past normal.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.799
You've got about an hour,
maybe a wee bit more,

25:45.961 --> 25:48.885
then you're literally
a walking, ticking time bomb.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.531
Thank you.

26:08.484 --> 26:11.033
Welcome to the States. Where we headed?

26:11.320 --> 26:12.913
Lebanon, Kansas.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.262
Dean, you know you don't have to do this.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.062
Of course I do.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.516
I just have to get close.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.069
And I can do that, okay?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.114
I can do that.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.866
You know, if this works, um...

26:54.363 --> 26:55.865
That bomb goes off.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.202
I know.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.396
- You cool with this?
- No.

27:28.063 --> 27:31.988
Even after everything she's done,
Amara's still my sister.

27:32.276 --> 27:33.402
She's my family.

27:34.236 --> 27:38.582
I can't...
I don't want to see her dead. But...

27:39.241 --> 27:40.584
Yeah?

27:41.243 --> 27:42.586
I understand.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.630
Dean.

27:47.749 --> 27:51.504
Cass. Okay, okay. All right.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.594
- I could go with you.
- No, no, no.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.763
No, I gotta do this alone.

28:04.183 --> 28:08.939
Listen, if... When this works, Sam...

28:09.438 --> 28:10.781
He's gonna be a mess.

28:11.607 --> 28:14.326
So look out for him, okay?
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

28:14.610 --> 28:15.953
Of course.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.165
Thank you for everything.

28:22.826 --> 28:26.296
Okay, look, I want a big funeral,
all right? I'm talking epic.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.123
Okay? Open bar, choir.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.464
Sabbath cover band
and Gary Busey reading the eulogy.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.636
Done.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.547
And for my ashes, I like it here.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.302
Yeah.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.139
You know,
as far as eternal resting places go.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.165
Come on, you know the drill.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.501
No chick flick moments, come on.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.672
Yeah, you love chick flicks.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.088
Yeah, you're right. I do. Come here.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.226
Okay, let's do this.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.438
He's not wrong.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.491
One little apocalypse,
and they shut up shop.

30:17.774 --> 30:18.946
Quitters.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.496
Your round, Moose.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.248
Dean.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.093
How did you find me?

30:40.088 --> 30:41.340
Does it matter?

30:43.425 --> 30:45.098
I'm here to give you what you want.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.471
Me.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.269
That's a change.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.614
Well, I can’t just stand by
and watch the world, my friends,

30:57.606 --> 30:59.108
and my family die.

31:00.525 --> 31:05.122
So if becoming a part of you
takes me away from that, then I'm in.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.157
You...

31:07.949 --> 31:09.496
And that bomb in your chest?

31:13.121 --> 31:17.126
Do you think I can't taste the power
coming off of you? Please.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.133
The problem is,
you've never been able to hurt me.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.342
So what makes this time any different?

31:26.134 --> 31:27.636
I don't have a choice.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.143
- What you're doing to the sun.
- That's not me.

31:34.476 --> 31:37.650
With my brother getting weaker,
the scales are tipping.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.902
Away from light.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.989
- And into darkness.
- Into nothing.

31:45.529 --> 31:49.830
When God's gone, the universe,
everything will cease to exist.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.536
Including me.

31:53.829 --> 31:54.830
And while law enforcement

31:55.038 --> 31:57.006
is telling people not to panic,

31:57.332 --> 31:59.926
residents are being advised
to stay in their homes,

32:00.168 --> 32:02.421
as authorities are baffled
by this strange...

32:03.338 --> 32:04.590
Boring.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.393
He looks horrible.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.183
My brother betrayed me.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.360
He locked me away for billions of years.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.359
- He sent you to execute me.
- No, no. No.

32:20.689 --> 32:23.363
He zapped me here, yes,
but he didn't want this.

32:23.775 --> 32:24.947
This wasn't his idea.

32:25.902 --> 32:29.702
You're family. He doesn't want you dead.
He doesn't want any of this.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.806
Hey, Chuck.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.886
How you holding up?

32:51.887 --> 32:52.888
Ah.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.560
Aces.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.059
- Is this what you wanted?
- No.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.396
I just wanted to hurt him.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.408
- I wanted to make him pay.
- Yeah, that's revenge.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.487
It'll get you out of bed in the morning.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.740
And when you get it, it feels great.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.788
For about five minutes.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.250
I've been there.

33:19.414 --> 33:20.791
Me and Sam,

33:21.291 --> 33:24.420
we have had our fair share of fights.
More than our share.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.928
But no matter how bad it got,
we always made it right.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.930
Because we're family.

33:32.177 --> 33:35.101
I need him. He needs me.

33:35.597 --> 33:40.068
And when everything goes to crap,
that's all you've got. Family.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.772
Now you might be an all-powerful being.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.283
But I think you're human where it counts.

33:47.609 --> 33:48.952
You simply need your brother.

33:50.612 --> 33:51.613
Just stop.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.123
You don't wanna be alone.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.241
Not really.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.958
I mean, hell,
maybe that's why you wanted me.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.007
But deep down, you didn't really want me.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.793
Because I'm not him.

34:05.669 --> 34:08.969
Maybe I can kill you. Or maybe I can't.

34:10.465 --> 34:13.309
Maybe if I pull this trigger,
we all live happily ever after.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.639
Or maybe we die bloody,
or maybe it doesn't matter.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.857
Because maybe there's a different way.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.186
So I'm gonna ask you again.

34:22.476 --> 34:25.150
Put aside the rage, put aside the hate.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.110
And you tell me.

34:29.609 --> 34:30.985
What do you want?

34:34.989 --> 34:36.333
You know, we, um...

34:37.367 --> 34:41.371
We need you to try and hang in there
just a little longer.

34:42.871 --> 34:45.045
I know. I'm trying.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.179
I'm gonna go get you some water.

35:06.980 --> 35:07.981
Chuck?

35:08.815 --> 35:09.816
What?

35:11.234 --> 35:12.235
Chuck?

35:13.987 --> 35:16.035
- Why did you bring me here?
- Brother, I...

35:23.538 --> 35:25.040
In the beginning,

35:27.042 --> 35:28.715
it was just you and me.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.589
We were family.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.850
I loved you, and I thought...

35:37.719 --> 35:40.723
I knew that you loved me.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.690
I did.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.232
- I do.
- But then,

35:46.394 --> 35:49.068
you went and you made
all these other things.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.242
I hated them.

35:53.234 --> 35:57.535
I hated you for needing something else.
Something that wasn't me.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.417
And then you locked me away.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.082
And all I could think about
was making you suffer.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.423
- You had your reasons.
- I did.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.931
And I thought revenge would make me happy.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.801
But I was wrong.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.768
What you've made...

36:29.437 --> 36:30.654
It's beautiful.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.609
It took me a long time to see that.

36:35.568 --> 36:38.287
I know that we can't go back
to the way things were.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.825
I don't want to.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.415
But I wish...

36:46.830 --> 36:50.585
I wish that we could just be family again.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.590
I do too.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.058
He did it.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.685
Bloody did it.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.353
And Dean?

38:18.254 --> 38:19.676
I think

38:19.881 --> 38:21.883
we're just gonna go away
for a while and...

38:22.050 --> 38:24.599
Hey. Yeah. Family meeting. I get it.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.232
But first...

38:43.738 --> 38:45.081
Better?

38:48.117 --> 38:49.585
What about us?

38:50.954 --> 38:52.877
- What about Earth?
- Earth will be fine.

38:54.374 --> 38:55.717
It's got you.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.881
And Sam.

39:07.303 --> 39:10.898
Dean, you gave me what I needed most.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.812
I wanna do the same for you.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.599
Sam, I'm so sorry.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.818
If you wanna talk...

39:56.644 --> 39:58.487
I'm here, if you need anything.

39:58.813 --> 39:59.985
Hello, hello.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.451
Cass.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.540
Don't.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.670
Sam Winchester. Toni Bevell.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.838
Men of Letters, London Chapterhouse.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.501
Oh, you won't have heard of me. Us.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.970
We're very traditional,
keep out of the way, keep to our studies.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.840
You, um... What?

40:26.132 --> 40:27.725
They sent me to take you in.

40:28.343 --> 40:31.563
- To take me in?
- Assuming the world didn't end, and...

40:31.846 --> 40:32.847
Yay.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.519
- Look, lady...
- We've been watching you, Sam.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.564
What you've done.
The damage you've caused.

40:41.147 --> 40:44.242
Archangels, Leviathans, The Darkness,
and now, well...

40:44.484 --> 40:46.737
The old men have decided enough's enough.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.705
I mean, let's face it, Sam.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.999
You're just a jumped-up hunter
playing with things you don't understand

40:52.200 --> 40:54.168
and doing more harm than good.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.996
Now, where's Dean?

40:59.207 --> 41:00.379
Dead.

41:03.378 --> 41:04.880
Listen, lady.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.860
I don't know who the hell you are,
or what the hell you want...

41:08.007 --> 41:09.179
Stop.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.558
- Put the gun down.
- I said stop.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.231
You and I both know
you're not gonna pull the trigger.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.733
Come on.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.110
Where the hell am I?

41:27.527 --> 41:28.779
Help.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.281
Help me.

41:48.589 --> 41:49.590
Mom?

42:22.540 --> 42:23.541
