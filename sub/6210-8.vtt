( blowing fanfare )

00:05.404 --> 00:07.505
Wow. All this just
because I finished

00:07.506 --> 00:09.207
my invention
for school?

00:09.208 --> 00:10.375
You shouldn't have.

00:10.376 --> 00:11.342
Even though
I did spend

00:11.343 --> 00:12.377
three weeks
working on it,

00:12.378 --> 00:13.644
not to mention missing

00:13.645 --> 00:15.313
<i>The English Patient</i>
on HBO 61 times.

00:15.314 --> 00:16.781
Cool your jets, Edison.

00:16.782 --> 00:19.584
The horns don't toot for you.

00:19.585 --> 00:21.386
This is for
our cousin Larry.

00:21.387 --> 00:22.587
What did he invent?

00:22.588 --> 00:23.755
Nothing.

00:23.756 --> 00:25.390
But cousin Larry
has come to expect

00:25.391 --> 00:28.827
some fanfare since he became
an Other Realm emperor.

00:28.828 --> 00:30.895
He has his own country,
I get dirty looks

00:30.896 --> 00:32.963
for taking up
too much couch space.

00:32.964 --> 00:33.864

00:33.865 --> 00:35.133
Ah. Here he comes.

00:35.134 --> 00:38.336
( blowing fanfare )

00:40.906 --> 00:42.106
Zelda.

00:42.107 --> 00:44.042
What a delight.

00:44.043 --> 00:47.645
This must be Sabrina.

00:47.646 --> 00:48.847
Kiss my ring.

00:48.848 --> 00:50.281
But I hardly
know it.

00:50.282 --> 00:51.216
( chuckles )

00:51.217 --> 00:52.950
I can't wait
to talk to you

00:52.951 --> 00:53.952
about the family--

01:17.909 --> 01:19.944
Stop me if you've heard
this one.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.951
So where is
your lovely sister?

01:26.952 --> 01:29.287
She's at her high school
equivalency reunion.

01:29.288 --> 01:30.755
They hold it
every year...

01:30.756 --> 01:32.257
at Costco.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.225
Oh, I'm gonna be late
for my symposium

01:34.226 --> 01:35.693
in the Other Realm.

01:35.694 --> 01:38.462
I've proved yet another
unsolvable theorem.

01:38.463 --> 01:40.098
Yes, well,
before you go,

01:40.099 --> 01:42.734
I must tell you, I've discovered
a very curious fact.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.235
You're your own grandpa?

01:46.305 --> 01:48.172
I found out that Zelda

01:48.173 --> 01:50.575
is the Rincess
of Massapequa Park.

01:50.576 --> 01:53.745
The country that borders
my country, Massapequa.

01:53.746 --> 01:54.779
Aunt Zelda's
a princess?

01:54.780 --> 01:57.048
Not "p," just "rrr."

01:57.049 --> 01:58.016
Really tiny countries

01:58.017 --> 02:00.217
can't afford a whole
"p"-rincess.

02:00.218 --> 02:02.187
Okay, but nonetheless,
Aunt Zelda,

02:02.188 --> 02:04.356
there's a whole country for you
to run, and me to inherit.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.090
SALEM:
Back off, Napoleon.

02:06.091 --> 02:08.026
Zelda promised me
my own sovereign state

02:08.026 --> 02:09.394
for my birthday.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.929
Or was it a chew toy?

02:11.930 --> 02:13.131
We witches live so long

02:13.132 --> 02:15.400
that we constantly
accumulate useless land.

02:15.401 --> 02:16.868
Just last week,
I found out

02:16.869 --> 02:19.370
I own a driveway
in Ashtabula.

02:19.371 --> 02:21.773
Would you like me to take
the country off your hands?

02:21.774 --> 02:24.209
Would you?
I've got the papers right here.

02:25.911 --> 02:28.279
Just one little signature.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.182
( <i>majestic theme playing</i> )

02:31.183 --> 02:33.351
If you press really hard.

02:33.352 --> 02:34.753
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to sign these

02:34.754 --> 02:36.421
after my symposium.

02:36.422 --> 02:39.156
So, Sabrina, finally
we get to talk

02:39.157 --> 02:40.892
about the family secret.

02:40.893 --> 02:43.094
I'd love to, Emperor Larry,
but I've gotta get to school.

02:43.095 --> 02:45.696
Today's the invention fair,
and mine is really cool.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.600
( toots horn )

02:49.601 --> 02:51.435
I think I know
the family secret:

02:51.436 --> 02:54.806
lack of proper excitement
over teenage achievements.

02:56.208 --> 02:57.242
It's a combination

02:57.243 --> 03:00.344
hairdryer-lipstick
applicator.

03:00.345 --> 03:02.480
( whirring )

03:02.481 --> 03:04.415
Excellent. I see them
in hotels everywhere.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.718
Except Europe,
where the current's weird.

03:06.719 --> 03:07.818
So, what does yours do?

03:07.819 --> 03:09.620
Oh, it filters the water

03:09.621 --> 03:12.123
from the school's water cooler,
leaving only pure H2O.

03:12.124 --> 03:14.025
Watch.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.326
( low humming )

03:15.327 --> 03:16.994
( bubbling )

03:19.298 --> 03:21.065
Wow, the water's so pure,

03:21.066 --> 03:22.500
I'm still thirsty.

03:22.501 --> 03:23.601
Sabrina.

03:23.602 --> 03:24.836
You're gonna win for sure.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.204
Thanks. It's
so nice to have

03:26.205 --> 03:27.505
someone else
excited about it.

03:27.506 --> 03:28.907
My aunts
didn't even care

03:28.908 --> 03:30.675
that our tap water
has radon.

03:30.676 --> 03:32.610
All systems are go
for the first-ever

03:32.611 --> 03:35.279
pepperoni pizza
putty prototype.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.849
Does the pepperoni pizza
putty prototype have a point?

03:37.850 --> 03:39.517
Say you order
a plain cheese pizza

03:39.518 --> 03:42.153
and it arrives
with pepperoni.

03:42.154 --> 03:46.457
Simply place the pepperoni pizza
putty prototype like so, and...

03:46.458 --> 03:47.591
( squishing )

03:47.592 --> 03:48.827
...voilà!

03:48.828 --> 03:49.994
Hey, it really works.

03:49.995 --> 03:51.328
One question: why don't you

03:51.329 --> 03:53.631
just pick the pepperoni
off with your fingers?

03:53.632 --> 03:55.433
What do I look like, an animal?

03:55.434 --> 03:58.136
Valerie, I like
your invention.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.570
Really?
What about mine?

03:59.571 --> 04:01.506
Excellent, as usual.

04:01.507 --> 04:02.740
Nice work.

04:02.741 --> 04:04.142
Thank you. Ha.

04:05.877 --> 04:06.811
( whirring stops )

04:06.812 --> 04:08.079
Swell.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.082
Now I look like
one of Red Skelton's paintings.

04:11.083 --> 04:13.084
Coming through.

04:13.085 --> 04:15.786
Harvey, I think
someone studied.

04:15.787 --> 04:18.589
All right! C-plus.

04:19.925 --> 04:21.225
B-minus.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.561
Yes! Once again,
I'm comfortably ensconced

04:23.562 --> 04:24.962
in the middle of the bell curve.

04:24.963 --> 04:26.363
All right, Valerie.

04:26.364 --> 04:27.699
I got an A!

04:27.700 --> 04:28.733
As usual.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.335
Uh, Mrs. Quick,
I'm not sure,

04:30.336 --> 04:32.236
but is this an A?

04:32.237 --> 04:33.571
Actually, it's an A-plus.

04:33.572 --> 04:36.574
Now let's all turn
to chapter 11.

for the millennium.

That's great.

04:51.823 --> 04:54.025
First! I got first place!

04:54.026 --> 04:56.227
I got a green
participant ribbon.

04:56.228 --> 04:57.595
Congratulations.
I got third.

04:57.596 --> 04:58.930
All right!

04:58.931 --> 05:01.332
And I got first!
Knew it.

05:02.467 --> 05:04.001
Valerie, I told you
it was a good invention.

05:04.002 --> 05:05.704
Thank you.

Kinkle.

05:09.441 --> 05:10.808
You're the only
football player

05:10.809 --> 05:13.878
to actually finish
an invention.

05:13.879 --> 05:16.714
What about me?
Hello.

05:18.984 --> 05:20.919
Hey, Valerie.
I heard you got third.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.020
Cool.
Thank you.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.122
Hey, Sabrina.
Yes, I did.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.924
I mean, uh--
You go first.

05:25.925 --> 05:26.991
We're doing
a walk for orphans.

05:26.992 --> 05:28.659
Do you wanna sign up?
Why?

05:28.660 --> 05:30.961
So I can do great,
be the best, walk the most

05:30.962 --> 05:32.930
and have everyone ignore it?

05:32.931 --> 05:35.233
( <i>unhappy theme playing</i> )

05:35.234 --> 05:38.269
Actually, it's so
the orphans can get cable.

05:40.839 --> 05:43.407
Oh, hi, honey. I wasn't
expecting you home for lunch.

05:43.408 --> 05:44.709
What's the matter?

05:44.710 --> 05:46.110
I got an A-plus
on a really hard test

05:46.111 --> 05:47.845
and won a blue ribbon
on my invention.

05:47.846 --> 05:48.979
Uh-huh.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.215
So, what's the problem?

05:50.216 --> 05:52.417
That! No one's excited!

05:52.418 --> 05:54.352
Oh, honey,
it's just that you get A's

05:54.353 --> 05:56.487
and win things so often,

05:56.488 --> 05:58.989
you can't expect a parade
every time.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.959
How about one person
walking by with a hearty

06:00.960 --> 06:02.127
"Well done"?

I, on the other hand,

math problem

Realm scientists

a group of mutes.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.634
Of course, now that
they're covered with smallpox

06:10.635 --> 06:12.136
they might be livelier.

06:12.137 --> 06:13.071
I would just like one person

06:13.072 --> 06:14.772
to get a little keyed up.

06:14.773 --> 06:15.739
( gasps )

06:15.740 --> 06:17.075
Sabrina, did I dream it,

06:17.076 --> 06:19.310
or did you win a blue ribbon?

06:20.645 --> 06:22.380
Yes, I did!

06:22.381 --> 06:24.215
Is that available for shredding?

to find a quick fix.

looking for?

06:31.757 --> 06:32.724
When I go back to school,

06:32.725 --> 06:34.559
I want my good work
acknowledged.

But I haven't found anything
under awards, accolades,

Not even lip service.

is adequate.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.759
You know what?

08:48.760 --> 08:51.162
I think I'll hold on
to my country.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.329
Well, it's your country.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.697
It's your choice.

08:53.698 --> 08:55.800
Right.
Of course, this means war.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.101
What?

08:57.102 --> 08:58.035
Change your mind?

08:58.036 --> 09:00.204
No.
Neither did I.

09:00.205 --> 09:04.275
You promised me that country,
and I want it!

09:04.276 --> 09:06.778
Prepare to fight!

09:06.779 --> 09:07.945
Fine!

09:09.047 --> 09:10.447
Would this be a good time

09:10.448 --> 09:12.617
to discuss taxes?

09:14.853 --> 09:16.754
How did your just
dessert turn out?

09:16.755 --> 09:19.456
Great. But that
little bit of acclaim

09:19.457 --> 09:20.925
has given me
quite a sweet tooth.

09:20.926 --> 09:22.292
Don't do it,
Sabrina.

09:22.293 --> 09:24.595
You're only supposed
to eat one bite.

09:24.596 --> 09:25.896
I know, I know,

09:25.897 --> 09:28.532
but a couple more won't hurt.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.101
( munching )

09:30.102 --> 09:31.336
Sabrina...

09:32.738 --> 09:34.639
Way to eat cake!

09:35.841 --> 09:37.775
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

09:41.313 --> 09:43.047
I can't believe
I ate the whole cake.

09:43.048 --> 09:44.448
Oh, crumb.

09:47.786 --> 09:49.153
Whoa.

09:49.154 --> 09:51.121
Sabrina.

09:51.122 --> 09:52.824
The way you closed
your locker,

09:52.825 --> 09:54.025
that was awesome.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.860
Yeah, I'm thinking
of going pro.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.197
Sabrina, do that again.

10:00.198 --> 10:01.399
Do what again?

10:01.400 --> 10:02.466
That thing
where you let oxygen

10:02.467 --> 10:05.002
into your mouth
and carbon dioxide out.

10:05.003 --> 10:05.970
You mean breathing?

10:05.971 --> 10:07.671
Yes! That's amazing!

10:07.672 --> 10:09.674
( gasps ):
There you go again!

10:09.675 --> 10:11.309
Oh, you know me,
I'm a fool when it comes

10:11.310 --> 10:13.277
to keeping myself alive.

10:13.278 --> 10:14.645
( <i>majestic theme playing</i> )

10:14.646 --> 10:16.047
May I?

10:18.316 --> 10:19.951
Zampano, you beast!

10:19.952 --> 10:21.419
It is mine!

10:21.420 --> 10:23.554
You already have her napkin!

10:29.128 --> 10:30.962
SALEM:
So, milady,

10:30.963 --> 10:32.529
now that you and Emperor Larry
are at war,

10:32.530 --> 10:35.199
might I suggest you leave
certain strategies

10:35.200 --> 10:37.735
to Minister of Defense
Saberhagen?

10:37.736 --> 10:39.804
No, you mightn't
suggest that.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.372
You're not my minister
of defense.

10:41.373 --> 10:43.474
You're not involved
in this in any way.

10:43.475 --> 10:44.908
Scat.

10:44.909 --> 10:48.178
This is going to be very awkward
to tell my staff.

10:49.715 --> 10:51.148
Rincess Zelda,

10:51.149 --> 10:52.616
I am but a simple peasant

10:52.617 --> 10:54.752
in roughly woven garments,

10:54.753 --> 10:57.788
but may I be your footstool?

10:57.789 --> 10:59.323
Well, okay.

10:59.324 --> 11:01.926
But as long as you
maintain your dignity.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.533
Obviously,
when Zelda said "scat,"

11:09.534 --> 11:11.402
she was speaking in code.

11:11.403 --> 11:14.372
Hmm, let's see, if
I translate it into Esperanto,

11:14.373 --> 11:15.373
and back into Hebrew...

11:15.374 --> 11:16.774
Right!

11:16.775 --> 11:19.544
I'm pretty sure she meant:
"Destroy Emperor Larry

11:19.545 --> 11:21.011
"and all he holds dear,

11:21.012 --> 11:23.681
so Salem can rule
his country."

11:23.682 --> 11:26.216
Give or take a letter or two.

11:26.217 --> 11:29.687
As you all know, I was planning
to give you another test today,

11:29.688 --> 11:32.289
but I've decided
to skip the test

11:32.290 --> 11:34.391
and just give Sabrina the A.

11:34.392 --> 11:35.693
Really? Thank you.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.461
I even bought
party hats and trail mix,

11:37.462 --> 11:39.897
so we can all celebrate
Sabrina's A.

11:39.898 --> 11:41.132
( applause )

11:41.133 --> 11:42.900
Hey, everybody. They just
declared peace in--

11:42.901 --> 11:45.369
Excuse me,
Sabrina got an A.

11:45.370 --> 11:48.606
Way a minute, Sabrina
got yet another A?

11:48.607 --> 11:51.075
And-- And I don't
have a hat.

11:52.010 --> 11:53.277
People who put
fawning down

11:53.278 --> 11:55.379
just aren't getting any.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.214
( laughs maniacally )

11:57.215 --> 11:59.917
I hope Emperor Larry likes
this sleeping potion,

11:59.918 --> 12:02.486
because it's the last thing
he'll ever taste.

12:02.487 --> 12:03.887
( laughs maniacally )

12:03.888 --> 12:05.423
Salem, what are you doing?

12:05.424 --> 12:06.723
Um...

12:06.724 --> 12:08.859
making s'mores.

12:08.860 --> 12:09.827
Well, don't make a mess.

12:09.828 --> 12:11.395
I've got battles to plan,

12:11.396 --> 12:13.330
and I don't
have time to clean.

12:13.331 --> 12:15.466
Yeah, I'm making s'mores.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.935
S'more poison for Emperor Larry!

12:17.936 --> 12:19.770
( laughs maniacally )

12:20.405 --> 12:22.006
Look! It's Sabrina!

12:22.007 --> 12:23.107
Whoo-hoo!

12:23.108 --> 12:24.875
( cheering and applause )

12:24.876 --> 12:26.410
( marching band playing music )

12:32.317 --> 12:33.317
What's the parade for?

12:33.318 --> 12:35.252
If they can have
a parade honoring men

12:35.253 --> 12:36.921
who have merely
walked on the moon,

12:36.922 --> 12:39.122
I think we can have one
honoring a little girl

12:39.123 --> 12:41.892
who has done her
literature homework.

12:54.172 --> 12:56.740
A letter from
the Other Realm.

12:56.741 --> 12:58.508
Zampano, you could have
just brought the letter.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.678
You didn't need to bring
the scalding toaster.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.248
Oh, it's from
the Witches' Council.

13:04.249 --> 13:06.150
They wanna have a dinner
honoring my achievements

13:06.151 --> 13:08.019
in math and science.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.486
That's wonderful.

13:09.487 --> 13:12.857
But what is this math
and science of which you speak?

13:12.858 --> 13:13.824
My work.

13:13.825 --> 13:16.127
You said you
admired all my work.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.662
That we've seen so far.

13:18.663 --> 13:19.797
Then you just adore me

13:19.798 --> 13:20.931
because you think you should,

13:20.932 --> 13:22.533
not because I deserve it.

13:22.534 --> 13:24.000
I've got to find
Emperor Larry.

13:24.001 --> 13:25.169
( distant explosion )

13:25.170 --> 13:27.370
Great. We're under attack.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.440
This assembly was called
to honor everyone

13:29.441 --> 13:32.276
who worked so hard
on the walk for orphans.

13:33.711 --> 13:35.179
I didn't know
there was an assembly.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.847
But we've decided to turn it

13:36.848 --> 13:39.850
into the first annual
Sabrina Awards instead.

13:39.851 --> 13:42.186
All right,
show's over, do-gooders.

13:42.187 --> 13:43.921
Take a seat. Go on.

13:43.922 --> 13:44.955
Hit it!

13:44.956 --> 13:48.125
( upbeat music plays )

13:48.126 --> 13:49.493
¶ S is 'cause ¶

13:49.494 --> 13:51.595
¶ She's so sublime ¶

13:51.596 --> 13:52.963
¶ A is 'cause ¶

13:52.964 --> 13:54.865
¶ She's awesome all the time ¶

13:54.866 --> 13:56.200
¶ B is 'cause she's ¶

13:56.201 --> 13:58.101
¶ The best babe in school ¶

13:58.102 --> 13:59.570
¶ R because she ¶

13:59.571 --> 14:00.971
¶ Really makes me drool ¶

14:00.972 --> 14:02.506
¶ And I is for ¶

14:02.507 --> 14:04.608
¶ The icon she's become ¶

14:04.609 --> 14:06.143
¶ N is 'cause she's great ¶

14:06.144 --> 14:07.611
¶ She makes me numb ¶

14:07.612 --> 14:09.713
¶ And A
It's redundant to say ¶

14:09.714 --> 14:11.582
¶ Is the great mark
She gets every day ¶

14:11.583 --> 14:12.950
¶ No matter how it's spelled ¶

14:12.951 --> 14:16.686
¶ Sabrina is unparalleled ¶

14:25.597 --> 14:27.364
( cheering and applause )

14:29.368 --> 14:31.669
Salem,
I have to get in touch

14:31.670 --> 14:32.736
with Emperor Larry.

14:32.737 --> 14:34.304
I've made a huge mistake.

14:34.305 --> 14:35.973
I wanted recognition.
I didn't care--

14:35.974 --> 14:37.541
SALEM:
Look out!

14:37.542 --> 14:38.475
Duck!

14:38.476 --> 14:40.878
Dive!

14:40.879 --> 14:43.214
Salem, what is going on?

14:43.215 --> 14:45.983
I set up a bunch of booby traps
for Emperor Larry.

14:45.984 --> 14:47.484
Remember?
You told me

14:47.485 --> 14:49.787
to terminate
with extreme prejudice.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.222
I never said that.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.990
Sure, nitpick.

14:54.225 --> 14:55.893
Well, I am sure being here

14:55.894 --> 14:58.229
at the first annual
Sabrina Awards

14:58.230 --> 14:59.530
means there is
going to be lots

14:59.531 --> 15:01.765
of entertainment...tonight.

15:01.766 --> 15:03.200
( coughing )

15:03.201 --> 15:06.604
Jeez, who writes
this garbage?

15:06.605 --> 15:08.639
Well, that--
That would be me.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.675
Um...it's you again.

15:11.676 --> 15:12.943
And the nominees

15:12.944 --> 15:16.246
for Best Relaxed
Sabrina Moment are:

15:16.247 --> 15:17.214
( <i>peppy theme playing</i> )

15:17.215 --> 15:19.650
Sabrina eating lunch.

15:19.651 --> 15:23.520
Sabrina leafing through
a magazine in Study Hall.

15:23.521 --> 15:26.723
Sabrina humming a Phantom Planet
song she heard

15:26.724 --> 15:29.192
on the radio that morning
and can't get out of her head.

15:30.695 --> 15:33.197
Sabrina at this very moment.

15:36.334 --> 15:38.501
And the Sabrina
goes to...

15:38.502 --> 15:39.503
Open it, open it, open it.

15:39.504 --> 15:41.505
Oh, my goodness,
the Sabrina goes

15:41.506 --> 15:43.807
to Sabrina Spellman.

15:43.808 --> 15:44.975
( applause )

15:50.081 --> 15:51.682
Oh, what a beautiful award.

15:51.683 --> 15:54.084
Um, well, the Sabrinas
are such an honor,

15:54.085 --> 15:55.753
and I'd just like
to share this award

15:55.754 --> 15:58.221
with everyone else
nominated in this category.

15:58.222 --> 15:59.890
( audience chuckles )
Thank you.

15:59.891 --> 16:02.726
( applause, cheering )

16:02.727 --> 16:04.795
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

16:14.739 --> 16:16.674
( explosions )

16:40.731 --> 16:42.032
( gunfire )

16:45.871 --> 16:47.337
( applause )

16:50.642 --> 16:53.911
So Massapequa Park is all yours.

16:53.912 --> 16:55.178
I surrender.

16:55.179 --> 16:56.847
( sobbing ):
No...

16:56.848 --> 16:58.481
( laughs )

16:58.482 --> 16:59.817
Excellent.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.652
Eh, can I make
a quick call?

17:01.653 --> 17:02.920
Certainly.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.688
If I can get my sentry
on the cell phone,

17:04.689 --> 17:07.223
I might be able to call off
that napalm attack.

17:07.224 --> 17:09.326
Rincess Zelda,

17:09.327 --> 17:10.961
your scones are ready.

17:10.962 --> 17:13.464
Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.699
I've decided
to abdicate my throne.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.233
I blame you.

17:17.234 --> 17:18.702
No, no, no.

17:18.703 --> 17:20.671
Look, maybe I should
go to my country,

17:20.672 --> 17:23.373
and explain my decision
to the rest of the population.

17:23.374 --> 17:25.242
You mean Isadore?

17:25.242 --> 17:26.343
Is that the capital?

17:26.344 --> 17:28.345
No. Isadore is a man.

17:28.346 --> 17:30.480
The rest of the
population, in fact.

17:30.481 --> 17:32.983
You love him,
don't you?

17:32.984 --> 17:35.152
Only three people
live in my country?

17:35.153 --> 17:35.952
Yes, and despite that,

17:35.953 --> 17:38.855
parking is still
a nightmare.

17:38.856 --> 17:41.158
Come on, Sabrina. They're about
to announce another winner,

17:41.159 --> 17:42.593
and it could be you!

17:42.594 --> 17:43.460
Oh, I'll tell you what:

17:43.461 --> 17:45.262
um, why don't you
go accept for me?

17:45.263 --> 17:47.397
Oh, boy! I-I'll--
I'll be sure to mention

17:47.398 --> 17:50.134
that you're for Native Americans
and against fur. Okay.

17:53.805 --> 17:56.373
Oh, Sabrina,
uh, congratulations.

17:56.374 --> 17:59.409
( sobbing ):
I just knew you'd win
for Best Supporting Sabrina.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.145
Gordie, you really worked hard
for those orphans, didn't you?

18:02.146 --> 18:04.281
Well...

18:04.282 --> 18:06.583
Aw, heck,
not as hard as you did

18:06.584 --> 18:08.051
on that Jumble this morning.

18:08.052 --> 18:10.153
Well, I did use ink.

18:10.154 --> 18:11.355
But...

18:11.356 --> 18:13.424
Well, I feel awful.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.558
And the winner is...

18:15.559 --> 18:16.927
Look at this,
we have a tie.

18:16.928 --> 18:18.195
Sabrina...

18:18.196 --> 18:19.896
and Sabrina.

18:19.897 --> 18:22.332
( cheering and applause )

18:22.333 --> 18:23.634
Stop it. Stop it!

18:23.635 --> 18:26.003
Sit down, for
crying out loud.

18:26.004 --> 18:27.238
Look,

18:27.239 --> 18:28.805
all I wanted was
a little recognition

18:28.806 --> 18:31.108
for doing a good job.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.475
But not at the expense

18:32.476 --> 18:34.077
of those who
are truly deserving.

18:34.078 --> 18:36.880
So I'm giving all my Sabrinas

18:36.881 --> 18:38.782
to Gordie
and the other do-gooders.

18:38.783 --> 18:39.816
( scattered applause )

18:43.188 --> 18:44.454
What's Sabrina doing?

18:44.455 --> 18:46.356
This never happens
at the American Music Awards.

18:46.357 --> 18:48.292
Cue the band.
Cue the band!

18:48.293 --> 18:49.860
SABRINA:
<i>So it turns out</i>

18:49.861 --> 18:50.994
constant praise

18:50.995 --> 18:53.663
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

18:53.664 --> 18:55.832
From now on, all I want
my hard work to bring me

18:55.833 --> 18:57.434
is a high school diploma,

18:57.435 --> 18:58.502
admittance to a good college

18:58.503 --> 19:00.069
and a high-paying job
with benefits.

19:00.070 --> 19:01.605
But that's it.

19:01.606 --> 19:04.074
I'm sorry. I should
have been more helpful.

19:04.075 --> 19:05.976
If I hadn't been so busy
thinking about myself,

19:05.977 --> 19:08.045
I would have remembered
to tell you that good work

19:08.046 --> 19:09.813
is its own reward.

19:09.814 --> 19:11.147
But how do I end this spell now

19:11.148 --> 19:13.616
without winning a Pulitzer
for my book report?

19:13.617 --> 19:14.584
Hm.

19:15.620 --> 19:18.088
Eat this and the spell
will be reversed.

19:18.089 --> 19:19.189
What is it?

19:19.190 --> 19:20.457
Humble pie.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.661
Oh, it's awful!

19:24.662 --> 19:27.264
Oh, I'll never get the taste
of humility out of my mouth.

19:27.265 --> 19:29.165
Well, I'd love
to sit and chat,

19:29.166 --> 19:31.468
but I am being honored
in the Other Realm.

19:31.469 --> 19:32.903
Finally.

19:32.904 --> 19:34.905
Excuse me, your majesty,
but it seems

19:34.906 --> 19:37.140
someone else could use
a piece of humble pie.

19:37.141 --> 19:39.944
But it was
a really hard problem.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.445
Well, all right,

19:41.446 --> 19:42.880
but just a small piece.

19:44.749 --> 19:46.683
Zelda! Let me make one more

19:46.684 --> 19:49.052
plea for rethinking this
surrender foolishness.

19:49.053 --> 19:52.456
I just know Larry's rear flank
is vulnerable.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.725
Salem, as someone once said
to Alexander the Great:

19:54.726 --> 19:56.293
have some pie.

19:56.294 --> 19:58.461
( sobbing )

20:00.231 --> 20:01.898
Another C-plus?

20:01.899 --> 20:03.634
Yes!

20:03.635 --> 20:04.635
Nice work, Harvey.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.003
B-minus.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.070
Nice work, Valerie.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.272
A.

20:09.273 --> 20:10.640
Nice work, Sabrina.

20:10.641 --> 20:11.875
Once again, you get an A,

20:11.876 --> 20:13.544
and nobody makes
a big deal out of it.

20:14.812 --> 20:16.213
Yes!

20:16.214 --> 20:17.981
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

20:23.654 --> 20:24.721
Next time,
let's try to have

20:24.722 --> 20:27.123
a nice visit without going
into a state of war.

20:27.124 --> 20:29.660
Well, it won't be
as much fun, but okay.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.794
Ooh, uh...

20:31.795 --> 20:34.331
I almost forgot.
For you, a horn.

20:34.332 --> 20:36.367
Let me guess: it's weird,
it makes no sense,

20:36.368 --> 20:37.701
I don't know why
I have it.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.836
It must be a clue
to the family secret.

20:39.837 --> 20:42.672
You have got great deductive
skill, Sabrina.

20:42.673 --> 20:44.107
Maybe one day you can join

20:44.108 --> 20:46.009
one of my secret
death squads.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.113
( door closes )
Huh.

20:50.114 --> 20:51.515
He's kind of fun
for a tyrant.

20:51.516 --> 20:52.916
Will we see him again?

20:52.917 --> 20:56.319
Probably at the post-war
reconstruction summit.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.021
Well, somebody has to
clean up the punji sticks

20:58.022 --> 20:59.323
in our front yard.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.991
Oh, Salem, did
you get rid

21:00.992 --> 21:02.493
of all those
booby traps?

21:02.494 --> 21:03.360
Absolutely.

21:05.696 --> 21:08.465
What exactly happened
while I was at school today?

21:09.305 --> 21:15.320
