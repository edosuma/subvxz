WEBVTT

00:07.074 --> 00:08.941
- Does it work?
- I've got the dial tone.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.977
Great. I'll toss the box.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.946
Why don't you toss it
in the salad, Kate?

00:13.948 --> 00:16.849
I could use the fibre. Ha ha.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.584
ALF, hold still.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.019
I wanna get it even.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.920
Well, don't cut it too short.

00:21.922 --> 00:25.824
It'll look like
I have a big schnoz.

00:25.826 --> 00:29.395
I didn't realize you were so
concerned with your appearance.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.664
You think I wake up
looking this good?

00:32.666 --> 00:33.732
[doorbell dings]

00:33.734 --> 00:35.501
Doorbell.

00:35.503 --> 00:36.969
Hide in the kitchen, ALF.

00:36.971 --> 00:39.805
Ha! Beat you to it.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.973
[clears throat]

00:40.975 --> 00:43.475
Two dollars, ALF, pay up.

00:43.477 --> 00:44.810
Two dollars?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.813
I didn't even get my manicure.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.882
Welcher.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.320
[gasps]
Willie! Kate!

00:55.322 --> 00:56.989
Raquel. Jake.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.791
We've been robbed!

00:58.793 --> 01:00.592
Oh, my gosh.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.928
That's terrible.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.931
Hey, don't look at me,
I've got an alibi.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.933
That's right,
Jake was in school.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.535
Well, I wasn't there either

01:09.537 --> 01:11.403
but I've got an alibi
for that too.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.841
That's it. No more TV
for the rest of the week.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.011
- What TV?
- Oh, that's right!

01:19.013 --> 01:21.113
They-they stole that too.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.682
And then they
took our silverware

01:23.684 --> 01:25.417
and our VCR

01:25.419 --> 01:27.853
and our original painting
of dogs playing pool.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.656
Oh.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.224
It was a powerful piece.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.528
And I feel even worse
about your circular saw.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.230
My saw was stolen?

01:38.232 --> 01:41.867
Yes, and Trevor
was going to return it tomorrow.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.502
That's what makes it so funny.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.939
Raquel, did you
call the police?

01:46.941 --> 01:49.741
We couldn't.
They took our phones.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.177
Well, I-I just happen
to have one.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.080
Incidentally, that is
your phone, isn't it?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.449
I have the receipt.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.984
Just checkin'.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.354
Thank you.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.456
Yes. Hello?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.391
This is Raquel Ochmonek.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.527
169 Hemdale.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.895
We've been robbed.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.597
How soon can you send
a black and white?

02:14.001 --> 02:16.668
An hour and a half?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.638
Our art collection could be back
across the border by then.

02:20.941 --> 02:24.710
Fine. Fine. We'll be here.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.879
Oh, I feel so violated!

02:26.881 --> 02:28.247
Oh, Raquel, I'm so sorry.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.782
Now listen, if there's
anything we can do to help..

02:30.784 --> 02:32.050
Just protect yourselves.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.619
Lock you doors and your windows.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.921
You never know when
somebody is gonna walk off

02:35.923 --> 02:37.556
with your possessions.
Goodnight.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.291
Our phone.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.928
I can get your phone back
for, uh, three bucks.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.531
But that's negotiable.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.470
Did I miss anything?
I was under the dryer.

02:53.908 --> 02:56.074
[theme music]

03:04.518 --> 03:06.518
[no audio]

[instrumental music]

03:59.907 --> 04:01.807
[doorbell dings]

04:01.809 --> 04:03.542
ALF, hide in the kitchen.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.744
I'm going, I'm going.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.714
Boy, if I had a nickel
for every time someone said--

04:08.716 --> 04:10.782
It's alright, ALF.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.451
It's just Jake.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.923
Hey, peewee, I didn't know
you could reach the doorknob.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.659
Watch it, I may be short
but I'm wiry.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.062
Hey, I brought your phone back.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.231
That'll be five bucks.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.799
I thought you said it was three.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.669
I said it was negotiable,
it can go up too, you know?

04:30.671 --> 04:33.505
It can also go down..

04:33.507 --> 04:36.475
...to nothing.

04:36.477 --> 04:40.312
Nothing. Yeah, yeah, that-that
was gonna be my next offer.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.016
Yo, Jake-hammer,
pull up a chair.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.917
We're playing cards.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.619
Great.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.222
I'll make that five bucks
one way or another.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.960
I never wager more than
I'm willing to lose.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.362
I'll bet Willie's car.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.965
I don't believe this.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.601
I just got off
the phone with Mrs. Litwak

05:02.603 --> 05:04.336
they have been robbed too.

05:04.338 --> 05:07.139
- Three robberies in a month.
- Mm-hmm.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.875
That's it, I'm taking action.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.543
What are you gonna do?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.812
I'm going to eat
all your valuable food

05:13.814 --> 05:16.148
before somebody steals it.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.717
Is that how you dealt
with crime on Melmac?

05:18.719 --> 05:21.386
That's how we dealt
with everything on Melmac.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.055
[doorbell dings]

05:23.057 --> 05:25.090
- ALF, doorbell.
- Yeah.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.626
Just call me Pavlov's alien.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.099
Raquel. Trevor.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.168
Guess what?
The Litwaks were robbed.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.670
- Oh, we heard.
- From who?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.105
Mrs. Litwak.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.240
She's such a busybody.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.610
Let's cut to the chase,
huh, Raquel?

05:45.612 --> 05:47.713
Now we're forming
a neighborhood watch.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.147
You guys wanna be part of it?

05:49.149 --> 05:52.184
- A neighborhood watch..
- That's right.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.518
Speaking of watches, Kate

05:53.520 --> 05:56.288
I hope the one
you lent me was insured.

05:57.658 --> 06:01.293
Um, maybe we should join
before we lose everything.

06:01.295 --> 06:04.363
Great. The first meeting is
tomorrow night at 8 o'clock.

06:04.365 --> 06:07.299
We'll bring extra chairs,
you provide the refreshments.

06:07.301 --> 06:09.000
Well, where's the meeting?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.603
Oh, here.
Didn't we mention that?

06:11.605 --> 06:14.506
I don't remember hearing it.
Do you, Kate?

06:14.508 --> 06:17.209
Maybe we were
out of the room at the time.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.211
Well, then, see you
tomorrow night at 8 o'clock.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.946
Oh, wait a minute, um..

06:20.948 --> 06:22.848
...shouldn't the meeting
be at your place

06:22.850 --> 06:25.217
seeing that
it's your idea and all.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.652
Oh, please, Kate, I'm too upset

06:27.654 --> 06:30.088
to take the plastic
off the furniture.

06:32.126 --> 06:34.292
We don't mind sitting
on plastic.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.061
Try doin' it naked.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.464
Let's compromise.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.299
Uh, we'll have the meeting
at your place

06:41.301 --> 06:43.368
and I'll bring the refreshments.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.872
Alright, but nothing fancy.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.307
A few finger sandwiches..

06:49.309 --> 06:50.976
...maybe a homemade
coffee cake.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.744
Preferably decaf.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.447
Yeah, and I'll come over
here and look after

06:55.449 --> 06:57.949
your teenage daughter, your son

06:57.951 --> 07:01.286
and AL..
That-that, uh, hairy thing.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.854
(Raquel)
'What hairy thing?'

07:02.856 --> 07:04.689
- Cat.
- Yeah.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.893
I, uh, momentarily
forgot the name for it.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.828
He's from New York.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.596
Well, see you tomorrow.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.398
Oh, don't forget
those finger sandwiches, huh?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.271
Finger sandwiches?

07:19.273 --> 07:21.506
And you won't let me eat cats.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.745
'I'm Officer Griswald'

07:26.747 --> 07:29.047
and I'll try to remember
each of your names.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.216
And if you neighbors
will all work together

07:31.218 --> 07:32.818
we can stop crime.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.487
'Remember the neighborhood
watch motto.'

07:35.489 --> 07:37.756
Don't let 'em
knock your block off.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.192
[laughing]

07:40.194 --> 07:42.027
I don't get it.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.361
It's just a joke, Mrs. Byrd

07:43.363 --> 07:46.097
you know, uh, knock, block.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.666
That's just stupid.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.570
Yikes.

07:51.572 --> 07:55.474
So, do any of you know
what citizen patrols are?

07:55.476 --> 07:56.975
- I do.
- 'Mm-hmm.'

07:56.977 --> 07:59.377
Teacher's pet.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.681
It's just neighbors

08:02.683 --> 08:04.616
taking turns
walking the streets.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.251
That's right,
now how many of you

08:06.253 --> 08:07.853
would be interested
in doing that?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.457
Hyah-ha.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.260
Hey, ALF, what's goin' on now?

08:15.262 --> 08:18.530
Well, the cop just
asked for streetwalkers

08:18.532 --> 08:21.399
and Kate raised her hand.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.203
Hey, I just call 'em
as I see 'em.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.175
- Gin.
- Not again.

08:30.177 --> 08:34.946
Hey, do you wanna go double or
nothin' for a trip to paradise?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.582
Either way I lose.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.985
Can you knock off the double
entendres?

08:39.987 --> 08:41.887
You're steaming up the windows!

08:44.591 --> 08:48.260
Officer Griswald, how often
would you say the perpetrators

08:48.262 --> 08:50.128
return to the
scene of the crime?

08:50.130 --> 08:52.998
Well, I'd never say it,
because I can't pronounce it!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.900
[laughing]

08:54.902 --> 08:56.835
But I know what you mean!
It does happen!

08:56.837 --> 08:58.403
And if the crooks missed
something of value

08:58.405 --> 09:00.505
the first time,
they might come back for it!

09:00.507 --> 09:03.308
That does it! I'm putting my
six-pack of Billy Beer

09:03.310 --> 09:04.943
in a safe deposit box!

09:06.847 --> 09:08.713
You're an idiot.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.116
Who do you think
you're talking to?

09:11.118 --> 09:12.484
(Brian)
'Now what are they doing?'

09:12.486 --> 09:15.420
Mrs. Byrd's trying
to hit on Trevor!

09:15.422 --> 09:18.723
- Let's just settle down here!
- Well, she started it!

09:18.725 --> 09:21.660
Now Trevor's trying to hit
Mrs. Byrd!

09:23.830 --> 09:28.266
Now, it would be helpful if the
people who are out on patrol

09:28.268 --> 09:30.735
could report back to a central
base station!

09:30.737 --> 09:32.871
So does anybody
have any radio equipment?

09:32.873 --> 09:35.407
A shortwave citizen band,
that sort of thing?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.709
Willie has a CB radio
in his garage!

09:37.711 --> 09:40.845
Your garage would probably make
a good headquarters!

09:40.847 --> 09:44.783
Would you be interested in being
the block captain?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.284
No, not really!

09:46.286 --> 09:50.121
Ah, he's just holding
out for a captain's hat!

09:50.123 --> 09:52.290
I nominate Willie Tanner
for block captain

09:52.292 --> 09:53.625
and I move that
we buy him a hat.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.126
- Second.
- All in favor?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.661
(together)
Aye.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.229
Settled. Let's hit the bricks
and nail this scum.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.965
Do we get to carry clubs?

10:00.901 --> 10:03.335
[instrumental music]

10:09.676 --> 10:12.844
- CB equipment?
- Operational.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.746
- Walkie talkies?
- Operational.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.116
Cordless phone
on separate line?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.385
Operational.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.587
- Stupid-looking hat?
- Op..

10:24.191 --> 10:27.892
That's unnecessary, ALF,
really unnecessary.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.594
Well, I'm upset, Willie.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.130
Give me one reason
why I can't be

10:32.132 --> 10:33.665
part of this neighborhood watch.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.401
Because you don't
put responsibility

10:36.403 --> 10:38.470
into irresponsible hands.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.238
That's not a reason.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.873
That's a platitude.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.208
Because I said so.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.143
Well, that's dogma.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.511
It's worse than dogma.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.913
It's...dogma-nure.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.885
The answer is no, ALF.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.022
Oh, but I'm the perfect choice
for this job.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.657
I've got a great voice.

10:58.659 --> 11:03.361
Yes, and people are gonna
wanna know whose voice that is.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.397
It'll be your voice, Willie.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.732
I'm a whiz with sound equipment.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.835
A little less bass,
a little more treble

11:10.837 --> 11:12.437
a smidgen of static.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.240
I'll sound just like you.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.809
All I need now
is a hesitation coach.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.847
I don't...think..

11:26.820 --> 11:29.988
Hello? Hello.
Mrs. Byrd, Trevor?

11:29.990 --> 11:32.724
Are you out there?
This is the Sentinel.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.394
The Sentinel?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.698
Yes, the Sentinel.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.567
Boy, that hat's
gone to your head.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.737
Trevor, what's the situation
out there?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.439
(Trevor over radio)
'We're just standin' here
in front of Byrd's house'

11:47.441 --> 11:49.207
'seein' if this
walkie talkie works.'

11:49.209 --> 11:50.675
(Mrs. Byrd over radio)
'Get out of my trash can,
Trevor.'

11:50.677 --> 11:51.776
(Trevor)
'Hey, I'm just lookin' for'

11:51.778 --> 11:53.311
'some of my stolen stuff here.'

11:53.313 --> 11:54.345
(Mrs. Byrd)
'Oh, are you insinuating'

11:54.347 --> 11:55.947
'that I robbed your house?'

11:55.949 --> 11:57.582
(Trevor)
'Well, this looks
like my pizza crust.'

11:57.584 --> 12:00.018
(Mrs. Byrd)
'I want a new partner.'

12:00.020 --> 12:01.453
Could you hold that thought?

12:01.455 --> 12:04.456
I'll be back in one minute.

12:04.458 --> 12:08.727
Willie, you can't run
this operation 24 hours a day.

12:08.729 --> 12:13.431
You're gonna need relief
and that's spelled A-L-F.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.900
N-O.

12:15.902 --> 12:20.071
Oh, one shot, Willie.
That's all I ask.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.873
I see you as a fair man..

12:23.210 --> 12:26.444
...with a stupid-looking hat.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.880
Alright, you want a chance,
you've got it.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.615
You've got your chance,
go ahead.

12:30.617 --> 12:34.786
Try! Try and make these two
work as a team.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.788
Alright, alright.
Give me room, alright?

12:36.790 --> 12:40.125
I'll show you how Captain Kirk
would have handled it.

12:40.127 --> 12:44.896
- Can I wear the hat?
- You have to earn this hat.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.064
Okay.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.569
Alright, Ochmonek, Byrd,
this is the Sentinel.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.772
Now, I want you two
to knock it off.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.674
You're supposed to be
fighting crime, not each other.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.077
(Trevor)
'Hey, that doesn't sound
like you, Tanner.'

12:59.079 --> 13:00.779
You see? I told you.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.348
(Mrs. Byrd)
'Yes, you sound so much
more forceful.'

13:03.350 --> 13:05.617
See? I told you.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.453
Now, I want to see
some teamwork out there!

13:08.455 --> 13:11.456
You know, like
Bartles and Jaymes.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.958
Okay, shake hands.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.262
(Mrs. Byrd)
'Shake hands? He's been
digging in my trash.'

13:17.264 --> 13:19.130
Well, then, salute each other.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.599
(Trevor)
'Alright, alright,
we're saluting.'

13:22.969 --> 13:24.836
Okay, at ease.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.706
Well?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.616
It looks stupid
on you too.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.527
Oh, Willie, will you tell Alf
that dinner is ready?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.329
He doesn't want any dinner!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.464
Alf is turning down a meal?

13:53.466 --> 13:56.935
Quick, call Geraldo Rivera!

13:56.937 --> 13:59.904
He's too busy being
The Sentinel!

13:59.906 --> 14:03.541
[chuckles]
He calls himself The Sentinel?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.978
Yeah! Silly, isn't it?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.981
Alf is really getting into this
neighborhood-watch thing.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.349
Oh, tell me about it.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.385
During yesterday's inspection
he told me that we didn't have

14:14.387 --> 14:17.088
adequate exterior lighting!

14:17.090 --> 14:19.424
He said he was gonna have
my bike impounded

14:19.426 --> 14:21.926
if I didn't get it registered!

14:21.928 --> 14:26.164
He wanted me to go to the pet
shop to price pit bulls.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.632
What did he tell you, dad?

14:27.634 --> 14:29.868
Oh, he told me to go back
to my family

14:29.870 --> 14:33.071
and leave the crime fighting
to the professionals!

14:33.073 --> 14:35.773
You know, maybe what we're
seeing here is the dawning

14:35.775 --> 14:42.013
of a new Alf.
More responsible, more mature.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.715

No.

'I'm in the can, Tanner!
I'll be out there at 7:00!'

14:56.396 --> 15:00.231
From now on please address me
as The Sentinel.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.434
And you forgot to say,
"Over!" Over!

15:03.436 --> 15:05.270
(Trevor)
'Give me a break, huh?'

15:05.272 --> 15:08.239
How would you like to walk
the graveyard shift? Over!

15:09.976 --> 15:12.744

'Okay. Okay. Over.'

'Yeah, I'm here.
What is it this time?'

15:36.803 --> 15:40.138
Suspicious looking character.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.942
Vicinity of 164 Hemdale.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.643
(Mrs. Byrd)
'I don't see anyone.'

15:45.645 --> 15:47.445
Well, she's wearing
a tacky fur coat

15:47.447 --> 15:50.815

15:50.817 --> 15:53.151

'That's me, you dolt.'

Oh, sorry. Uh, outrageous coat,
babe and I mean that.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.827
Oh, hey, wait! Wait!

16:02.829 --> 16:05.763
There's another suspicious
character on the next block.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.365
Check it out.

'Check it out yourself,
and get off my back.'

Tanner, I know a crime is
committed every five minutes

16:30.724 --> 16:33.324
but they're not
all in your neighborhood.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.793
That's because
I'm on the job.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.063
What is it this time?

16:39.065 --> 16:43.401
A man just came
out of 202 Hemdale

16:43.403 --> 16:45.937
carrying a large plastic bag.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.140
Oh-oh, he's headed for the curb!

16:49.142 --> 16:52.410
It's going down!
It's going down!

16:52.412 --> 16:55.380
Could this guy be
taking out his trash?

17:01.488 --> 17:04.355
Uh...could be.

- Yeah.

your CB with ya.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.309
Everyone thinks
that you're taking

17:58.311 --> 18:00.845
this neighborhood watch thing
far too seriously.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.648
Have I, as the Sentinel

18:03.650 --> 18:05.783
done something
that's offended you?

18:05.785 --> 18:08.886
Let us just say we don't
want to be involved anymore.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.888

I guess I got a little
carried away, huh?

18:20.867 --> 18:23.234
You called me horsemeat.

something nice

We're going to Tijuana
to do some shopping.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.825
We have a whole house
to refurnish.
