It looks like a church.

That's it.
Used to be a church.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.457
Ain't a church no more.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.221
They decommissioned it

11:47.406 --> 11:50.204
Gangway, I'm bringing

11:51.210 --> 11:53.906
What kind of business?

11:53.979 --> 11:56.379
I think he's looking for
a room of his own, Cordelia.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.974

I don't know.
One night, maybe two.
Depends.

12:08.360 --> 12:12.319
I never rent short-term,
and I don't rent to strangers.

12:13.766 --> 12:17.497
But I can make exceptions.

12:46.198 --> 12:50.498
You've been working so hard

Which way is town?

13:37.583 --> 13:41.383
Town is that way,

13:41.453 --> 13:45.719
But I'm sure you didn't
come here for a view.
But here's your key.

<i>I told them.</i>

13:58.804 --> 14:01.432
Cordelia, I don't know what
happened to all that mail.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.442
It just disappeared,
but they won't believe me.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.536
God! It's so humiliating.
Do you know what he did?

14:07.613 --> 14:10.605
Uh-uh.
Postmaster comes in...

14:10.683 --> 14:13.083
and he rips my name tag
right off my shirt.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.120
Right in front
of everybody.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.554
And like that's not bad enough,
he took my Mr. Zippy patch.

14:18.624 --> 14:22.025
You should have told your

14:22.094 --> 14:25.427
Stupid post office.
Ain't the only job in town.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.931
The hell it ain't.
If you had any sense, Wally,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.901
you'd crawl back to him
and beg for the job.

14:30.970 --> 14:34.098
Yeah, well,
I already tried that.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.073

14:52.958 --> 14:54.949
Damn guacamole.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.655
Will you put them

14:57.730 --> 15:02.429
- Why can't you do it yourself?
You know I'm busy.
- Get her sheets, will you?

15:02.501 --> 15:06.335
No, I just started that stove.
I can't do everything at once.

What the hell did he steal
that had you going over
100 miles an hour?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.810

Excuse me, mister. We'd like

Sheriff, you better
watch it. He's armed.

36:29.987 --> 36:34.720
Any other ways in or out
of this place?
Aside from doors and windows?

36:35.927 --> 36:38.862
Got some place you
want us to put him?

36:54.779 --> 36:57.805
Jeryline, let's go
make some coffee.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.282
Looks like we're in
for a long night.

37:06.490 --> 37:09.891
Where did you
get that from?
It was my husband's.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.328
[Meowing]
Cleo! Hi, baby.

37:13.397 --> 37:17.231
You let the cat in.
She just appeared.

37:17.301 --> 37:19.235
Brayker, what are you doing?

37:19.303 --> 37:21.794
Animals aren't immune.
They can be possessed.

37:21.872 --> 37:24.841
- [Hissing]
- Give me the cat! Shit!

37:27.245 --> 37:29.270
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>
The cat. The cat.

37:29.347 --> 37:34.444
Brayker, my cat is not possessed
by some demon from hell.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.586
We'll see.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.589
Listen, I got
to talk to you.
What?

37:39.657 --> 37:42.854
I got nothing to say.
I just gotta talk to you
for a second.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.693
I don't want to talk. Why don't
you bother somebody else?
Just for a second.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.927
You want to talk?
Let's talk about how you
abandoned Cordelia.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.902
How you left her to die.
Huh?

37:52.970 --> 37:56.269
I hope you're ashamed
of yourself.
Not particularly, no.

37:56.340 --> 37:59.639
Everybody's got
to look out their selves.

37:59.710 --> 38:03.771
- I'm for getting out of here.
- No one's going anywhere
till Mr. Brayker says so.

Hey, Roach.
Haven't you caused
just about enough trouble?

38:17.928 --> 38:21.830
Excuse me. I'm trying
to have a conversation
with my friend, Wally.

38:21.899 --> 38:25.733
He's not your friend.
Assholes don't have friends.

38:28.739 --> 38:30.673
Excuse us.

38:30.741 --> 38:33.437
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

38:37.948 --> 38:40.781
Jesus, Roach!

38:40.851 --> 38:44.912
So... you got yourself
a new boyfriend.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.923

41:01.225 --> 41:03.955
[Thinking]
If they spend the same money
on dinner and a movie,

41:04.028 --> 41:07.259
they can call you "girlfriend"
instead of "whore."

is let me in.

- Hello, Cordelia.

42:17.101 --> 42:21.367
I realized something awful
about myself tonight, Wally.

42:21.438 --> 42:24.930
My whole life, I've avoided
the guys who really loved me.

42:26.944 --> 42:28.605
Like you.

42:32.483 --> 42:35.611
You really love me,
don't you, Wally?

42:35.686 --> 42:39.486
Yes, Cordelia,
I really love you.

42:41.292 --> 42:44.159
I've always loved you.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.561
From the very first time
I delivered your mail.

42:49.767 --> 42:52.702
Well, don't just do it
with your eyes, Wally.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.906
It's some kind of tunnel.
It's a mine shaft.

43:02.980 --> 43:06.916
Not surprising.
The whole area's
riddled with them.

43:06.984 --> 43:09.111
This means this
is a way out.

43:09.186 --> 43:13.555
We can get to town

find out we're gone.

43:13.624 --> 43:16.559

You're talking Genesis.
That beginning?

And the earth was
a formless void...

55:43.640 --> 55:46.734
and darkness covered
the face of the deep.

55:50.280 --> 55:52.805
But the darkness wasn't empty.

55:52.882 --> 55:56.875
It was full of creatures.
Full of demons.

55:58.588 --> 56:03.616
<i>And they had seven keys</i>
<i>formed into a circle...</i>

56:03.693 --> 56:08.153
<i>to focus the power of the cosmos</i>
<i>into their hands...</i>

56:08.231 --> 56:11.291
<i>until God stepped forth</i>
<i>and said,</i>

56:11.368 --> 56:14.565
<i>"Let there be light."</i>

56:14.637 --> 56:17.071
<i>And there was light.</i>

two or three million millennia.

And one day they find
the seventh key here on earth.

56:40.363 --> 56:44.493

<i>with the blood of a carpenter...</i>

by the Romans...
