on your kick-a-poo juice...

42:36.439 --> 42:37.767
and send you to kingdom come.

42:37.857 --> 42:40.431
Now, drop your guns and come on out!

42:50.453 --> 42:51.995
B.A.: Move, suckers!

43:01.172 --> 43:02.370
[Exclaiming]

43:28.449 --> 43:30.857
Got a little advice for you, pal.

43:31.202 --> 43:34.951
Next time a preacher talks, you better listen.

43:50.013 --> 43:52.089
Hannibal, l've really gotta give you credit.

43:52.181 --> 43:55.135
l never could figure out
how you were gonna get it done.

43:55.226 --> 43:58.975
Reverend, sometimes our work
is kind of like yours. lt's a matter of faith.

43:59.063 --> 44:02.515
l'm not sure that's how Drew and his friends
are gonna look at all this.

44:02.609 --> 44:06.309
All they're gonna see
are some small rooms for a long time.

44:06.404 --> 44:09.405
l'll tell you one thing,
you sure made my job here a lot easier.

44:09.490 --> 44:11.697
By that, I mean
the job I'm supposed to be doing.

44:11.784 --> 44:14.821
Not busting stills
and fighting moonshine runners.

44:14.913 --> 44:18.447
Reverend, when you do the Lord's work,
a man has many duties.

44:18.541 --> 44:19.620
Amen.

44:21.294 --> 44:23.251
-Bye.
-Bye.

44:24.547 --> 44:26.255
TAYLOR: Good luck to you.
FACE: Take care.

44:26.341 --> 44:27.669
We'll see you.

44:27.759 --> 44:31.922
One thing that still bothers me, though....
Doesn't it strike any of you guys as funny?

44:32.013 --> 44:33.044
What's funny?

44:33.139 --> 44:34.966
We been on this whole trip...

44:35.058 --> 44:38.972
and we haven't seen
one single fuzzy little fruit bat. Not one.

44:39.062 --> 44:42.146
Murdock, l read that article.
lt's fruit ''gnats.''

44:43.524 --> 44:44.639
Gnats?

44:45.944 --> 44:48.565
Yeah, little bitty things. You know, gnats.

44:50.698 --> 44:53.783
But that perverts my whole understanding
of the cosmos.

44:53.868 --> 44:56.988
l don't know how anything works
if they're gnats.

44:57.747 --> 44:59.823
Oh, l'm back to square one.

45:01.251 --> 45:03.373
Hey, Hannibal, take a look.

45:07.507 --> 45:09.464
l really wanted to thank you.

45:09.842 --> 45:11.041
No sweat.

45:11.135 --> 45:14.504
Well, even if it wasn't,
l especially wanted to thank you.

45:14.597 --> 45:18.429
I'm just sorry that we didn't get a chance
to be better friends, B.A.

45:18.518 --> 45:21.472
Well, l got these guys
l gotta keep on wheels.

45:21.729 --> 45:24.814
And besides, the Army is after us.

45:25.275 --> 45:27.101
Wherever we go, there's trouble.

45:27.193 --> 45:30.776
lf we stay in one place too long,
things get kind of hot.

45:31.281 --> 45:34.281
Maybe some day you'll work that out,
you know.

45:34.742 --> 45:35.905
Yeah.

45:36.411 --> 45:39.328
Sergeant, l think it's about time we rolled.

45:42.125 --> 45:43.868
[Slow instrumental music]

45:44.669 --> 45:46.827
And maybe then l can see you.

45:48.548 --> 45:49.662
Yeah.

45:50.508 --> 45:53.260
HANNlBAL: Time to go, Sergeant.
Let's move out.

45:58.182 --> 46:00.508
[Slow instrumental music intensifies]

46:15.074 --> 46:17.032
[Military instrumental music]

46:33.134 --> 46:34.842
