WEBVTT

00:04.583 --> 00:06.959
JOEY, HEY.

00:06.959 --> 00:10.166
DAWSON, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU GUYS HAVE THE CRUCIBLE.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.959
BELINDA CHECKED IT OUT
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

00:12.959 --> 00:14.333
OH, NO.

00:14.333 --> 00:18.583
WELL, SERVES ME RIGHT,
I GUESS, FOR BEING THAT GIRL.

00:18.583 --> 00:19.333
WHAT GIRL?

00:19.333 --> 00:20.917
THE GIRL WHO RENTS THE MOVIE

00:20.917 --> 00:22.250
THE NIGHT BEFORE
AN ALL-IMPORTANT PAPER IS DUE

00:22.250 --> 00:23.500
BECAUSE HER DEBILITATING
ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER

00:23.500 --> 00:26.208
HAS GOTTEN IN THE WAY OF
HER ACTUALLY READING THE BOOK.

00:26.208 --> 00:28.458
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
THAT GIRL?

00:28.458 --> 00:30.917
WELL, BETWEEN
TAKING CARE OF
BABY ALEXANDER

00:30.917 --> 00:32.333
AND GETTING THE B&B
UP AND RUNNING,

00:32.333 --> 00:34.291
I...I HAVEN'T HAD
A WHOLE LOT OF TIME

00:34.291 --> 00:36.166
FOR THAT PESKY ENDEAVOR
KNOWN AS SCHOOLWORK.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.125
B&B? I THOUGHT YOU
WORKED AT THE MARINA?

00:40.375 --> 00:41.625
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:41.625 --> 00:45.917
THAT'S A LONG AND
EXCEEDINGLY SOAPY
STORY, DAWSON.

00:45.917 --> 00:47.417
OK.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.000
SO, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.750
HAS EVE HELPED YOU
ADD ANY MORE CRIMES
AND MISDEMEANORS

00:53.750 --> 00:55.708
TO YOUR RECORD?

00:55.708 --> 00:58.375
EVE LEFT TOWN, ACTUALLY.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.542
WELL...

01:07.542 --> 01:09.125
THANKS A LOT, DAWSON.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.792
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
AROUND SCHOOL.

01:10.792 --> 01:12.500
ALL RIGHT.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.208
I'LL BE THE ONE
CLOAKED IN FAILURE.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.750
HOLD ON.
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOEY?

01:16.750 --> 01:19.291
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
DO THE PAPER?

01:19.291 --> 01:20.625
I'M LISTENING.

01:20.625 --> 01:21.417
ALL RIGHT.

01:21.417 --> 01:23.625
AFTER WE GOT
THE ASSIGNMENT,

01:23.625 --> 01:25.041
I WENT UP TO GREEN,
AND I SAID,

01:25.041 --> 01:27.875
"LOOK, DO YOU REALLY
WANT THE STANDARD
5-PAGES OF FOOTNOTES

01:27.875 --> 01:29.417
"AND CRIBBED
ENCYCLOPEDIA
PASSAGES

01:29.417 --> 01:31.417
CHRONICLING
THE SALEM WITCH
TRIAL, OR--"

01:31.417 --> 01:32.583
LET ME GUESS.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.875
YOU SOLD HIM ON THE IDEA
OF MAKING A MOVIE INSTEAD?

01:34.875 --> 01:38.208
CLASSIC DAWSON LEERY.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.458
HERE'S THE BEST PART.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.417
JEN AND PACEY ARE
ALSO EXCUSED FROM
DOING THE PAPER,

01:41.417 --> 01:43.250
AS LONG AS THEY LEND ME
A HAND TOMORROW.

01:43.250 --> 01:46.708
I GUESS MY INVITATION
GOT LOST IN THE MAIL.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.333
I WOULD'VE INVITED YOU.
IT JUST--

01:48.333 --> 01:49.208
FORGET ABOUT IT.

01:49.208 --> 01:54.083
SO WHAT'S IT ABOUT,
YOUR MOVIE?

01:54.083 --> 01:56.250
WELL, UM, SINCE WE'RE
READING THE CRUCIBLE,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.625
WE'RE STUDYING
THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS,

01:58.625 --> 02:00.375
I FIGURED WHY NOT
DO A DOCUMENTARY

02:00.375 --> 02:02.458
BASED ON SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED RIGHT
IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD?

02:02.458 --> 02:03.917
WITCH ISLAND.

02:03.917 --> 02:07.166
SO, BASICALLY,
YOU'RE RIPPING OFF
THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.

02:07.166 --> 02:09.166
I AM INSULTED.

02:09.166 --> 02:12.583
I AM MAKING
A REAL DOCUMENTARY.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.750
I WANT TO TRY TO USE
THE MYTH OF WITCH ISLAND

02:14.750 --> 02:16.208
TO TELL A LARGER STORY

02:16.208 --> 02:18.750
ABOUT HYPOCRISY
AND RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.250
SO...ARE YOU IN?

02:23.708 --> 02:25.792
WELL, YOU KNOW...

02:25.792 --> 02:28.083
IF I BLOW OFF
THE PAPER,

02:28.083 --> 02:28.834
THEN I'LL PROBABLY
FAIL THE CLASS,

02:28.834 --> 02:31.333
AND IF I FAIL THE CLASS,

02:31.333 --> 02:34.375
WELL, THAT COULD BE THE
BEGINNING OF A LONG AND
TRAGIC DOWNWARD SPIRAL

02:34.375 --> 02:36.333
THAT DOOMS ME TO WAIT
THE TABLES OF CAPESIDE'S
GREASY SPOONS

02:36.333 --> 02:39.375
FOR ETERNITY, SO...

02:39.375 --> 02:41.000
COUNT ME IN.

03:32.542 --> 03:35.625
IN THE YEAR 1692,
13 YOUNG WOMEN--

03:35.625 --> 03:37.291
WELL, TEENAGED GIRLS,
REALLY--

03:37.291 --> 03:40.458
WERE BANISHED
TO A SMALL ISLAND OFF
THE NEW ENGLAND COAST

03:40.458 --> 03:42.875
BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED
OF PRACTICING WITCHCRAFT.

03:42.875 --> 03:47.291
ONE NIGHT A YEAR LATER,
A FIRE RAGED OUT OF CONTROL,

03:47.291 --> 03:48.500
KILLING THEM ALL.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.708
HANDS DOWN,
BEST HIGH SCHOOL
MAKE-OUT PLACE EVER.

03:53.708 --> 03:56.291
I THINK THAT'S WHERE
YOUR FATHER AND I MADE LOVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

03:56.291 --> 03:59.208
Dawson: GOD, MOM.
HONEY, ARE YOU OK?

03:59.208 --> 04:02.583
I GOTTA SAY, BLAIR WITCH
DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME.

04:02.583 --> 04:03.959
I WASN'T REMOTELY SCARED,

04:03.959 --> 04:05.500
THAT GIRL WAS IRRITATING
BEYOND MEASURE,

04:05.500 --> 04:06.917
AND I HAD TO RUN
TO THE SNACK BAR

04:06.917 --> 04:08.875
IN DIRE NEED OF DRAMAMINE.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.834
I WAS SCARED.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.792
THAT'S NO SURPRISE
THERE, POTTER.

04:13.792 --> 04:15.959
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
QUITE THE SKITTISH KITTEN.

04:15.959 --> 04:17.333
I THOUGHT BLAIR WITCH
WAS GROUNDBREAKING.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.916
HOLLYWOOD LAID TO WASTE
BY A COUPLE GUYS WITH
A CAMCORDER.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.750
HOW COOL IS THAT?

04:21.750 --> 04:24.917
FRANKLY, I THINK MY FATHER
MAKES SCARIER MOVIES WITH
HIS HOME VIDEO CAMERA.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.542
YOU GUYS WANT SCARY?

04:26.542 --> 04:27.500
CHECK OUT THE WITTER FAMILY
CHRISTMAS PROJECT.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.083
GUARANTEED TO MAKE
YOUR TEETH CHATTER.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.750
Jen: BEFORE WE'RE OFF
TO SEE THE WITCH,

04:31.750 --> 04:34.083
I'D LIKE TO OPINE THAT
THERE ARE NO SUCH THING
AS WITCHES.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.792
HERE WE GO.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.875
I SAY "WITCH" IS JUST
A BUZZ WORD FOR A GIRL

04:37.875 --> 04:41.959
WHO HAPPENED TO FOLLOW
HER COMPLETELY HEALTHY,
TOTALLY NATURAL URGES

04:41.959 --> 04:43.667
AND EXPLORE
HER SEXUALITY.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.834
BUT SEE,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
IN THE SWINGIN' 1690s

04:45.834 --> 04:48.583
WITHOUT GETTING
THE GOOD TOWNSFOLK
ALL UP IN ARMS.

04:48.583 --> 04:49.625
SO WHAT DO
THESE PURITANICAL
IMPOTENT CREEPS DO?

04:49.625 --> 04:51.875
INSTEAD OF REACHING
FOR THE VIAGRA,

04:51.875 --> 04:53.000
THEY BRAND THESE GIRLS
AS WITCHES.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.291
THEY SEND THEM OFF TO
SOME GODFORSAKEN ISLAND

04:55.291 --> 04:57.667
TO DIE A HORRIBLE,
SOLITARY DEATH.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.125
WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,
JEN.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.125
I MEAN,
WE LIVE IN A WORLD

05:00.125 --> 05:02.125
WHERE YOU CAN FOLLOW
YOUR NATURAL URGES

05:02.125 --> 05:03.417
WITHOUT
FEAR OF PERSECUTION.

05:03.417 --> 05:04.750
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:04.750 --> 05:08.250
I WOULD'VE BEEN SO BURNED
AT THE STAKE BY NOW.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.792
OK. I THINK
IT'S TIME TO SET UP
FOR SOME INTERVIEWS.

05:10.792 --> 05:13.708
UM, JOEY, LIKE
TO LEND ME A HAND?

05:13.708 --> 05:14.875
SURE.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.125
YOU GUYS RUSTLE UP
SOME INTERVIEWEES.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.417
JA WOHL, HERR DIRECTOR.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.375
Pacey:
HAVE FUN, KIDS!

05:21.375 --> 05:24.125
DOESN'T THAT JUST
WARM YOUR HEART?

05:24.125 --> 05:26.583
KEVIN AND WINNIE
TAKING THOSE FIRST
TENTATIVE STEPS

05:26.583 --> 05:28.291
BACK TO
THE WONDER YEARS.

05:28.291 --> 05:30.291
ACTUALLY, IT JUST MAKES ME
REALLY GLAD THAT YOU AND I

05:30.291 --> 05:33.708
HAD THE FORETHOUGHT
NEVER TO HOOK UP.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.333
AMEN, SISTER CHRISTIAN.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.625
WHY IS THAT,
DO YOU THINK?

05:37.625 --> 05:40.417
WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT
THE CLINICAL RESEARCH,

05:40.417 --> 05:43.333
YOU'LL FIND THAT
THE SMART-ASS SIDEKICK,
HE NEVER GETS THE GIRL.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.667
OHH.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.083
THE REAL REASON
THERE WAS NEVER
A YOU AND ME, LINDLEY,

05:46.083 --> 05:50.542
IS BECAUSE YOU AND ME--
WE DON'T NEED ANYTHING
FROM EACH OTHER.

05:50.542 --> 05:53.875
I'M SORRY.
I LEFT MY DECODER RING
BACK IN THE CEREAL BOX.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.417
YOU SEE,
YOU, AS THE GIRL
WHOSE WANTON WAYS

05:56.417 --> 05:57.166
HAD HER BANISHED
TO THE BOONIES,

05:57.166 --> 05:59.500
YOU NEEDED THE AFFECTION

05:59.500 --> 06:00.959
OF THE UNBLEMISHED
SMALL TOWN PURE-HEART

06:00.959 --> 06:04.166
TO VALIDATE YOU IN YOUR
OH, SO VULNERABLE TIME,
RIGHT?

06:04.166 --> 06:06.834
ME, AS THE PERENNIAL
BLACK SHEEP OF
THE WITTER BROOD,

06:06.834 --> 06:11.041
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED
THE LOVE AND AFFECTION
OF A WOMAN

06:11.041 --> 06:13.458
WHOSE DRIVE AND DEVOTION
SO SHAMED ME TO THE CORE

06:13.458 --> 06:15.875
THAT IT WOULD FORCE ME
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH,

06:15.875 --> 06:18.417
I DON'T KNOW.
SHALL WE CALL IT
MY INNER ACHIEVER?

06:19.750 --> 06:20.583
BUT YOU AND ME,
WE'RE DIFFERENT.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.750
WE'RE ON
A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.792
GOD, I THOUGHT THAT DAWSON
WAS GOOD AT DECONSTRUCTION.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.583
AH, PRINCIPAL GREEN!
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

06:28.583 --> 06:29.834
NOW IS NOT THE BEST TIME.

06:29.834 --> 06:31.625
I JUST WANNA LET YOU
KNOW THAT I TAKE
MY APPOINTMENT

06:31.625 --> 06:32.417
TO THE HEAD OF
THE DISCIPLINARY
COMMITTEE

06:32.417 --> 06:34.834
WITH THE UTMOST
SERIOUSNESS,

06:34.834 --> 06:36.041
AND I AM DETERMINED
NOT TO LOSE YOUR TRUST.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.708
THAT'S AN EARNEST ATTITUDE.
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME--

06:38.708 --> 06:41.583
I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW
THAT THE LAST FEW WEEKS
HAVE BEEN TUMULTUOUS,

06:41.583 --> 06:43.041
TO SAY THE LEAST,

06:43.041 --> 06:45.875
BUT I'M PLEASED
TO REPORT THAT I HAVE
MY PRIORITIES IN ORDER.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.667
GOOD. I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.959
I'D LIKE TO
RUN BY A FEW IDEAS,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.417
COME ON.

06:52.417 --> 06:54.917
EXCELLENT!
OK, I'VE READ
THE RULES OF CONDUCT

06:54.917 --> 06:56.333
PREPARED BY
THE BOARD OF
EDUCATION...

06:56.333 --> 06:58.959
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I MISS THIS, JOEY.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.917
ME, TOO.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.041
YOU KNOW, I...
I FEEL LUCKY.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.417
SO DO I.

07:06.417 --> 07:09.959
LIKE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO RECAPTURE
A FEELING THAT I LOST

07:09.959 --> 07:11.250
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.750
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
IT'S LIKE--

07:14.750 --> 07:17.125
I MEAN, GRANTED, IT'S ONLY
FOR A SCHOOL PROJECT,

07:17.125 --> 07:19.625
BUT IT FEELS GOOD TO BE
MAKING MOVIES AGAIN.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.500
AHH...

07:22.500 --> 07:25.000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT US.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.583
SILLY ME.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.208
WELL, THAT--THAT, TOO.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.208
OBVIOUSLY.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.917
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I...

07:32.917 --> 07:36.583
I MISS THAT WHOLE
"LET'S MAKE A MOVIE" BUG
THING WE HAD

07:36.583 --> 07:40.542
BEFORE THINGS GOT
SO TERMINALLY ANGSTY,
BUT IT'S...

07:40.542 --> 07:43.708
I'M REALLY GLAD
WE'RE FRIENDS AGAIN.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.458
FRIENDS.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.750
RIGHT.

07:52.750 --> 07:55.667
300 YEARS AGO, HARLOTS WHO
WERE PRACTICING WITCHCRAFT

07:55.667 --> 07:57.417
WERE BANISHED
TO THAT ISLAND.

07:57.417 --> 07:59.625
AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE
IS PROOF-POSITIVE

07:59.625 --> 08:00.625
THAT THE GOOD LORD
DOESN'T TAKE LIGHTLY

08:00.625 --> 08:03.458
TO THOSE WHO DABBLE
IN THE BLACK ARTS.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.417
ONE TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL,
THIS KID DISAPPEARED
THERE.

08:05.417 --> 08:06.959
HE WAS A BIG STONER,

08:06.959 --> 08:08.500
ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT
HAS LED ZEPPELIN IV

08:08.500 --> 08:10.792
PLAYING IN HIS HEAD
AT ALL TIMES.

08:10.792 --> 08:14.375
SO EVERYBODY SAID
HE PROBABLY GOT WASTED
AND DROWNED.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.125
I DON'T KNOW.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.000
SOME PEOPLE SAY
THE WITCHES GOT HIM.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.208
YEAH, WELL, KIDS JUST
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR THERE
OVER THE YEARS,

08:22.208 --> 08:24.834
AND THEY SAY IT'S
THE WITCHES OR WHATEVER.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.125
BUT I THINK THE CIA OR THE NSA
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

08:27.125 --> 08:31.708
IT'S JUST LIKE OUR GOVERNMENT
TO COME UP WITH SOME OCCULT
BACK STORY

08:31.708 --> 08:33.542
TO COVER UP
THEIR MALFEASANCE.

08:33.542 --> 08:34.332
NOBODY BROUGHT SNACKS?

08:34.332 --> 08:36.332
NO.
COME ON, GUYS!

08:36.332 --> 08:38.291
WHAT IS A FIELD TRIP
WITHOUT THE SNACKS?

08:38.291 --> 08:40.166
NOBODY BROUGHT
THE DORITOS,
THE HO-HOS?

08:40.166 --> 08:43.582
MY KINGDOM FOR A COKE
WRAPPED IN TIN FOIL.

08:43.582 --> 08:46.708
IT'S THE, UH,
DAWSON LEERY PARTY,
RIGHT?

08:46.708 --> 08:47.667
PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

08:47.667 --> 08:50.000
MIND IF I ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I'M MAKING A MOVIE.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.834
ONLY IF YOU
RETURN THE FAVOR.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.792
ALL RIGHT?

08:56.208 --> 08:59.083
SO, UH...

08:59.083 --> 09:01.208
WHAT'S YOUR MOVIE
ABOUT?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.375
I'M MAKING A DOCUMENTARY
ABOUT WITCH ISLAND.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.375
WHAT'S YOUR MOVIE ABOUT?

09:04.375 --> 09:06.708
I'M MAKING A DOCUMENTARY

09:06.708 --> 09:09.041
ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE
MAKING A DOCUMENTARY
ABOUT WITCH ISLAND.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.792
EVER SINCE
BLAIR WITCH  HIT,

09:10.792 --> 09:12.875
EVERY GEEK
WITH A CAMCORDER
AND A DREAM'S

09:12.875 --> 09:14.959
BEEN OUT HERE,
SO WITH A LITTLE LUCK,

09:14.959 --> 09:18.208
THIS BABY WILL GET ME ON
THE FESTIVAL CIRCUIT,
RIGHT?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.834
YEAH. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT WITCH ISLAND?

09:20.834 --> 09:24.417
YOU KNOW, YOU KIDS THINK
IT'S ALL SPOOKY FUN

09:24.417 --> 09:25.959
AND KITCHY COOL
AND ALL THAT,

09:25.959 --> 09:28.750
BUT JUST DON'T GET SO
CAUGHT UP IN YOUR LITTLE
SCOOBY-DOO ADVENTURE

09:28.750 --> 09:31.041
THAT YOU GET STUCK
OUT THERE PAST DARK.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.792
OH, COME ON.
WE DON'T SCARE THAT EASY.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.375
SHE CALLING ME A LIAR.
YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?

09:34.375 --> 09:35.750
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, HUH?

09:35.750 --> 09:37.208
GIRLS DIED OUT THERE.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.542
YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE
A LITTLE TICKED OFF
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

09:39.542 --> 09:40.750
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO?

09:40.750 --> 09:42.750
YOU THINK THEY'RE ABOVE
TAKING THEIR ANGER OUT

09:42.750 --> 09:44.333
ON AN ERRANT
TEENYBOPPER OR TWO

09:44.333 --> 09:46.000
EVERY ONCE IN
A FULL MOON, HUH?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.583
THESE GIRLS, SOMETIMES THEY
JUST CAN'T CONTROL THEIR
NATURAL URGES, YOU KNOW?

09:48.583 --> 09:51.667
ALL RIGHT, ALL ABOARD.
LET'S GO.

10:29.291 --> 10:31.291
HEY, GANG.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.625
WELCOME TO WITCH ISLAND.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.375
I'M WENDY DALRYMPLE OF THE
CAPESIDE HISTORICAL SOCIETY,

10:35.375 --> 10:39.250
AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU
MAY HAVE ABOUT WITCH ISLAND,

10:39.250 --> 10:40.458
WHICH, I'M ASHAMED TO SAY,

10:40.458 --> 10:42.166
REPRESENTS
A PARTICULARLY
DARK PERIOD

10:42.166 --> 10:42.750
OF OUR NATION'S
HISTORY.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.875
Jen: GOOD GOD.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.375
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
A SNACK BAR OR ANYTHING
OVER HERE, WOULD YA?

10:47.375 --> 10:48.708
'CAUSE I'M FAMISHED.

10:48.708 --> 10:51.041
AND CAMERON OVER THERE
DECIDED TO CANCEL
THE 7-ELEVEN RUN

10:51.041 --> 10:52.542
BEFORE WE GOT ON
THE BOAT.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.625
Wendy: YOU WILL FIND
SOME REFRESHMENTS AT OUR
GIFT SHOP, YOUNG MAN,

10:54.625 --> 10:57.291
ALONG WITH A LOVELY
SELECTION OF OUR
WITCH-THEMED SOUVENIRS.

10:57.291 --> 10:58.708
OH! I LIKE SOUVENIRS.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.250
MAKING A LITTLE MOVIE,
ARE WE?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.625
HE'S RIPPING OFF
THE BLAIR WITCH
PROJECT.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.000
SEEN IT.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.125
COME WITH ME.
I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE CEMETERY.

11:10.125 --> 11:10.917
GOES OVER REAL WELL WITH
YOU FILMMAKER TYPES.

11:10.917 --> 11:15.000
IT'S GOT A LOT
OF ATMOSPHERE.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.333
HEY, JOEY, YOU REALIZE
BLAIR WITCH  WAS FAKE, RIGHT?

11:19.333 --> 11:19.959
WHEREAS MY DOCUMENTARY
IS REAL.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.667
PACEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.375
"HAS THAT WICKED CRUSH
GOT YOU DOWN?

11:40.375 --> 11:43.583
"DO YOU STARE AT HIM FOR HOURS
WITHOUT GETTING SO MUCH
AS A GLANCE IN RETURN?

11:43.583 --> 11:45.917
"DO YOU EVER CALL
AND HANG UP,

11:45.917 --> 11:47.708
"RIFLE THROUGH HIS GARBAGE?

11:47.708 --> 11:50.708
"HAS THE THOUGHT OF
DISFIGURING HIS GIRLFRIEND
EVER CROSSED YOUR MIND?

11:50.708 --> 11:52.041
"STALK NO MORE, LADIES.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.542
"THIS HANDY-DANDY
INCANTATION

11:53.542 --> 11:55.917
"WILL TURN THE OBJECT OF
ALL YOUR SUGARY AFFECTIONS

11:55.917 --> 11:58.000
INTO A LOVESICK PUPPY DOG."

11:58.000 --> 11:59.291
DREAM ON, LINDLEY.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.792
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
IT'LL WORK?

12:00.792 --> 12:02.291
WELL, NOT TO BE
A NAYSAYER...

12:02.291 --> 12:04.333
NO, ACTUALLY,
TO BE A NAYSAYER,

12:04.333 --> 12:06.083
MY BELIEF IN THE
POWER OF SPELLS IS
SOMEWHERE UP THERE

12:06.083 --> 12:09.542
WITH MY BELIEF
IN THE VALIDITY
OF SEA MONKEYS.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.041
I'M GONNA TRY IT.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.333
REALLY? ON WHOM?

12:12.333 --> 12:14.667
YOU.
ME?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.291
WHO BETTER?
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO ME
IN THE SLIGHTEST.

12:17.291 --> 12:18.792
NOT IN THE LEAST.

12:18.792 --> 12:19.834
OUCH.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.250
NO, NO, NO.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.708
YOU ARE CERTAINLY
QUITE THE LITTLE
UBER-VIXEN,

12:23.708 --> 12:25.667
AND I AM NOTHING
IF NOT FOND OF YOU,

12:25.667 --> 12:27.542
BUT YOU'RE JUST
NOT MY TYPE.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.417
RIGHT BACK AT YOU, MAN.

12:29.417 --> 12:33.667
I'M BROODING AND COMELY.

12:33.667 --> 12:36.166
I'M SURE THAT YOU SCORE
WAY HIGH ON SOME GIRL'S
CUTE-O-METER, PACE,

12:36.166 --> 12:37.250
JUST NOT MINE.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.500
I'M A BETTER CATCH THAN
TY THE BIBLE BEATER

12:39.500 --> 12:41.875
OR THAT SKIRT-CHASING
NEANDERTHAL CHRIS WOLFE.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.583
THIS COMING FROM A GUY
WHOSE PAST TWO RELATIONSHIPS
HAVE ENDED

12:44.583 --> 12:45.959
WITH THE GIRL
EITHER LEAVING TOWN
TO AVOID PROSECUTION

12:45.959 --> 12:50.208
OR COOL OUT IN CRAZY CAMP
FOR THE SUMMER.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.834
OUCH.

12:57.959 --> 12:59.417
THERE ARE ONLY 12.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.250
WHAT?

13:00.250 --> 13:01.458
THERE WERE 13 WITCHES,
DAWSON.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.291
13 GIRLS WERE SENT HERE,

13:03.291 --> 13:04.417
AND THERE ARE ONLY
12 GRAVES.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.667
SMART GIRL.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.750
NOBODY EVER
PICKS UP ON THAT.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.667
HER NAME WAS
MARY WALDECK.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.125
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.125
HER BODY WAS NEVER FOUND.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.333
NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE
WHAT HAPPENED,

13:16.333 --> 13:18.625
BUT THERE ARE 2 DISTINCT
SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.750
FOR THOSE THAT LIKE
A GOOD GHOST STORY,

13:20.750 --> 13:22.041
WELL, THEY BELIEVE THAT
SHE REALLY WAS A WITCH

13:22.041 --> 13:23.625
AND SHE HAUNTS THE ISLAND
TO THIS DAY.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.792
BUT FOR THOSE ROMANTICS
OUT THERE,

13:26.792 --> 13:32.458
THEY BELIEVE THAT HER LOVER
CAME AND TOOK HER AWAY
FROM THIS AWFUL PLACE.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.083
HER LOVER?

13:34.083 --> 13:35.250
YEAH.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.542
I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CLIFF NOTES.

13:37.542 --> 13:38.667
MARY WAS AN ORPHAN.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.333
SHE WAS TAKEN IN BY A FAMILY
CALLED THE BENNETTS

13:41.333 --> 13:42.959
AND RAISED ALONGSIDE
THEIR OWN SON WILLIAM.

13:42.959 --> 13:46.083
WILLIAM AND MARY
GOT ALONG FAMOUSLY,

13:46.083 --> 13:46.959
SO MUCH SO, IN FACT,

13:46.959 --> 13:49.458
THAT IN TIME,
THEY FELL IN LOVE.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.625
UH-OH.

13:51.625 --> 13:56.166
ONE NIGHT, MARY AND WILLIAM
WERE FOUND IN BED TOGETHER.

13:56.166 --> 14:00.208
THIS DID NOT GO OVER WELL
WITH THE GOD-FEARING BENNETTS.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.333
AND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,

14:01.333 --> 14:03.458
MARY WAS NO LONGER
THEIR DAUGHTER.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.500
SHE WAS A WITCH.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.333
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.792
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THIS
POOR GIRL HAD TO GO THROUGH?

14:11.792 --> 14:14.333
THIS IS A YOUNG GIRL
NO OLDER THAN YOU.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.458
PUT ON TRIAL, BANISHED
TO SOME GODFORSAKEN ISLAND

14:16.458 --> 14:19.583
FOR CRIMES THAT SHE
DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND,
MUCH LESS COMMIT.

14:19.583 --> 14:23.792
SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE.

14:23.792 --> 14:28.500
I THINK THAT THAT'S
WHAT MAKES THIS ISLAND
SUCH A CHARGED PLACE.

14:28.500 --> 14:34.875
'CAUSE IF YOU'VE EVER
LOVED SOMEBODY THAT
YOU COULDN'T BE WITH,

14:34.875 --> 14:38.917
YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR:

14:38.917 --> 14:40.625
SADNESS, LONGING,

14:40.625 --> 14:43.083
THE UNCERTAINTY.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.708
YOU TAKING THIS DOWN,
DAWSON?

14:47.708 --> 14:50.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:50.083 --> 14:54.375
SOUL MATES TORN APART
BY CIRCUMSTANCES
BEYOND THEIR CONTROL,

14:54.375 --> 14:57.417
DOOMED TO WONDER
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN?

15:01.291 --> 15:03.208
THERE'S YOUR MOVIE.

15:04.208 --> 15:06.875
WHAT ABOUT THE FIRE?
WHERE DID THAT HAPPEN?

15:06.875 --> 15:09.500
THROUGH THE WOODS
AT THE CHURCH.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.417
CAN YOU TAKE US THERE?
I'D LOVE TO GET SOME FOOTAGE.

15:11.417 --> 15:13.542
NO.

15:13.542 --> 15:16.083
I NEVER, EVER
GO INTO THE WOODS.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.959
AND IF YOU KIDS ARE SMART,

15:19.959 --> 15:21.708
YOU WON'T, EITHER.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.166
BUT IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO,

15:25.166 --> 15:27.500
WE HAVE SOME MAPS
IN THE GIFT SHOP.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.917
"WITH LIGHTS LOW
AND FEET ON THE FLOOR,

15:28.917 --> 15:32.750
"CHANT THESE WORDS
TO MAKE HIM YOURS:

15:32.750 --> 15:35.500
"DAR SABBOLETH...

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
"DEMOTIVKA...

15:37.500 --> 15:41.083
DEMOTIVKA, RHINOTCHKA,
BLEETH."

15:50.917 --> 15:52.125
YOUR TURN.

15:52.959 --> 15:54.125
EXCUSE ME?

15:54.125 --> 15:56.458
I'M SORRY.
IT SOUNDED
LIKE YOU SAID

15:56.458 --> 15:59.333
SOMETHING ABOUT
ME CONSUMING THAT
GOD-AWFUL MUCK.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.458
SAYS RIGHT HERE THAT BOTH MYSELF
AND THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION

16:02.458 --> 16:05.792
MUST INGEST OF THE POTION
IN ORDER FOR THE SPELL TO WORK.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.166
NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.000
PLEASE?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.458
PRETTY, PRETTY,
PRETTY PLEASE?

16:11.458 --> 16:14.792
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SWALLOW
THE BRANCHES, I PROMISE.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.208
FINE.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.375
FINE.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.000
BUT, LINDLEY...

16:21.000 --> 16:23.083
PAYBACK IS GONNA
BE A BITCH.

16:26.667 --> 16:29.667
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

16:29.667 --> 16:32.208
LESS THAN FRESH.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.917
WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE?

16:33.917 --> 16:36.708
JUST A COUPLE OF CRAZY KIDS
PRACTICING A LITTLE BIT
OF BLACK MAGIC.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.083
YEAH.

16:38.083 --> 16:41.625
YOU SHOULDN'T MESS WITH THINGS
THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.834
HERE. THIS WILL TAKE YOU
THROUGH THE WOODS

16:47.834 --> 16:49.792
AND TO THE CHURCH.

16:49.792 --> 16:51.166
AND, OH, YEAH,
DON'T GET LOST

16:51.166 --> 16:53.375
BECAUSE IT'S VERY DARK,
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS,

16:53.375 --> 16:55.917
AND THERE IS AN EXCELLENT CHANCE
THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE SEEN

16:55.917 --> 16:59.166
OR HEARD FROM EVER AGAIN.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.291
OK?

17:05.165 --> 17:06.791
Jen: TAKE THAT
MARY WALDECK GIRL,
FOR EXAMPLE.

17:06.791 --> 17:08.708
WAS SHE A WITCH?
I THINK NOT.

17:08.708 --> 17:11.165
SOUNDS LIKE
SHE JUST HAD A BAD CASE
OF THE WARM AND FUZZIES.

17:11.165 --> 17:14.040
Joey: IT'S TOO
HEARTBREAKING FOR WORDS.

17:14.040 --> 17:14.750
Dawson: I COULDN'T
DISAGREE MORE.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.083
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

17:17.083 --> 17:20.208
IT CLEARLY ILLUSTRATES
HOW LOVE CAN THRIVE

17:20.208 --> 17:21.834
IN EVEN THE WORST
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.375
YEAH, AND LOOK
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.375
NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

17:25.375 --> 17:29.917
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
THAT MARY DIED A VERY SAD
AND LONELY DEATH,

17:29.917 --> 17:30.750
SEPARATED FROM THE ONE BOY
SHE EVER LOVED.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.708
I DON'T BUY THAT.

17:32.708 --> 17:35.041
IF 2 PEOPLE ARE TRULY,
MADLY, DEEPLY IN LOVE,

17:35.041 --> 17:36.291
THEY'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO BE WITH EACH OTHER.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.375
THEY WERE YOUNG.
THEY WERE SPLIT UP
FOR A LONG TIME.

17:38.375 --> 17:41.708
MAYBE HE FORGOT ABOUT HER.
MAYBE HE MET SOMEONE ELSE.

17:41.708 --> 17:43.375
BUT IF HE DIDN'T
MEET SOMEBODY ELSE
AND FORGOT ABOUT HER,

17:43.375 --> 17:45.708
THEN OBVIOUSLY, THEY
WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:45.708 --> 17:47.041
SEE MY POINT?

17:47.041 --> 17:49.083
COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE NAIVE?

17:49.083 --> 17:50.583
COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE CYNICAL?

17:50.583 --> 17:51.583
COULD YOU BE ANY MORE
IRRITATING?

17:51.583 --> 17:54.083
PIPE DOWN, YOU GUYS.
WE'RE HERE.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.875
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE CHANCES ARE THAT THEY
GOT A MEN'S ROOM IN THERE?

17:57.875 --> 18:00.959
'CAUSE I THINK
I WENT A LITTLE HEAVY
ON THE WITCH'S BREW.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.291
BE RIGHT BACK.

18:08.917 --> 18:11.375
SPAGHETTI STRAPS
AND OPEN-TOED SHOES?

18:11.375 --> 18:12.250
NOT ON MY WATCH.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.750
INAPPROPRIATE DISPLAY
OF THE FEMALE FORMS,

18:20.750 --> 18:22.917
STATUTE 97.1.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.041
OFFENSIVE AND DISGUSTING.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.917
UH, EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.375
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

18:32.375 --> 18:34.166
ELVIS HAS MOST DEFINITELY
LEFT THE BUILDING.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.417
AND IN HIS ABSENCE,

18:35.417 --> 18:37.792
THERE WILL BE NO SIDEBURNS
CREEPING PAST THE EARLOBES.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.917
RULES OF CONDUCT, BABY.

18:39.917 --> 18:42.000
READ 'EM, LEARN 'EM,
LIVE 'EM.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.417
LISTEN TO THIS.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.750
THE TOWNSPEOPLE
BUILT THE CHURCH

19:11.750 --> 19:16.000
'CAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD
HELP THE GIRLS FIND GOD.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.166
THEY'D SEND A MINISTER
OVER EVERY SUNDAY,

19:17.166 --> 19:19.166
BUT THE GIRLS WOULD JUST
TEASE THEM SO MERCILESSLY,

19:19.166 --> 19:20.542
EVENTUALLY HE GAVE UP
AND STOPPED COMING.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.667
I CAN HANG WITH
THOSE GIRLS.

19:25.291 --> 19:28.834
I WONDER IF PACEY
LOVES ME YET.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.583
THEY WERE MURDERED.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.834
BEG YOUR PARDON?

19:34.834 --> 19:38.458
IT SAYS HERE
THAT A GROUP OF MEN
FROM THE MAINLAND

19:38.458 --> 19:40.500
TREATED THE ISLAND
LIKE THEIR OWN
PERSONAL BROTHEL.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.166
WHEN WORD GOT OUT,
THE BIBLE-THUMPERS
GOT TOGETHER

19:44.166 --> 19:45.583
AND DECIDED ENOUGH
WAS ENOUGH.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.375
AND THEN
AN ANGRY MOB CAME,

19:47.375 --> 19:49.583
CORRALLED THE GIRLS
INTO THIS CHURCH,

19:49.583 --> 19:50.959
SET IT ON FIRE.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.917
THAT'S WHEN WILLIAM
MUST'VE RUN OFF WITH MARY.

19:52.917 --> 19:54.208
HOLD ON, ROMEO.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.333
WHY ARE YOU
READING INTO THIS
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

19:56.333 --> 19:59.250
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WILLIAM DIDN'T
LIGHT THE TORCH?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.667
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE 'CAUSE HE LOVED HER.

DO YOU THINK
I MADE A MISTAKE?

31:06.041 --> 31:07.291
WHEN AND WHERE?

31:07.291 --> 31:09.333
WELL...

31:09.333 --> 31:12.417
I TOLD JOEY THAT
WE NEEDED SOME TIME APART.

31:12.417 --> 31:15.500
DO YOU THINK
YOU MADE A MISTAKE?

31:15.500 --> 31:19.291
NOT AT FIRST, BUT...

31:19.291 --> 31:23.375
WHEN I LOOK AT HER NOW,
AND I SEE HOW FAR APART
WE DRIFTED, AND I...

31:23.375 --> 31:25.959
[SIGHS]

31:25.959 --> 31:28.375
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT IF I WAS WRONG?

31:29.583 --> 31:30.667
WHAT IF WE DON'T
END UP TOGETHER?

31:30.667 --> 31:34.375
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

31:34.375 --> 31:38.875
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT I SEE
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, DAWSON?

31:38.875 --> 31:40.500
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE,

31:40.500 --> 31:44.250
I SEE A GUY
WHO CONSISTENTLY WEARS
HIS HEART ON HIS SLEEVE.

31:44.250 --> 31:47.375
SO NO MATTER
HOW HARSH IT MAY SEEM
IN RETROSPECT,

31:47.375 --> 31:51.291
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO PUT
SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN
YOURSELF AND JOEY,

31:51.291 --> 31:53.708
I KNOW ALL YOU WERE
DOING WAS JUST
FOLLOWING YOUR HEART.

31:53.708 --> 31:56.708
AND WITH THAT
IN MIND,

31:56.708 --> 32:01.208
I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.

32:18.250 --> 32:22.083
Jen: SO YOU HONESTLY THINK
WE CAN PULL THIS OFF?

32:22.083 --> 32:25.208
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

32:25.208 --> 32:27.917
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
FEELINGS FOR ME, RIGHT?

32:27.917 --> 32:28.917
NONE WHATSOEVER.

32:28.917 --> 32:31.291
NO OFFENSE, OF COURSE.

32:31.291 --> 32:33.250
NONE TAKEN, OF COURSE.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.875
YOU FOR ME? FEELINGS?

32:34.875 --> 32:37.458
HARDLY EVER THINK
ABOUT YOU.

32:37.458 --> 32:38.583
YOU GOTTA LOVE THAT.

32:38.583 --> 32:40.333
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

32:40.333 --> 32:43.583
UH...

32:43.583 --> 32:45.750
SHOULD I TAKE
MY PANTS OFF?

32:45.750 --> 32:47.625
MAYBE WE SHOULD KISS FIRST.

32:47.625 --> 32:48.625
YEAH.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.125
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

32:59.834 --> 33:01.625
WAIT. IS THIS THE SPELL?

33:01.625 --> 33:03.834
I DON'T KNOW.

33:03.834 --> 33:06.125
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T CARE.

33:06.125 --> 33:10.250
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
IN NOVEMBER OF 1999,

33:10.250 --> 33:12.625
4 HYPER-VERBAL TEENAGERS
WANDERED OFF INTO THE
WOODS ON WITCH ISLAND

33:12.625 --> 33:16.291
TO FILM SOME
RIDICULOUS DOCUMENTARY
FOR HISTORY CLASS,

33:16.291 --> 33:18.458
AND 8 HOURS LATER,

33:18.458 --> 33:20.750
2 OF THEM STARTED
MAKING OUT.

33:26.583 --> 33:27.667
THAT WAS...

33:27.667 --> 33:30.000
WEIRD.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.458
YEAH.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.041
TRY AGAIN?

33:34.041 --> 33:34.250
OK.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.667
HOW ABOUT THAT?
MORE WEIRD?

33:46.667 --> 33:48.708
NOT SO MUCH.

33:52.583 --> 33:54.500
[SHOUTING]

33:54.500 --> 33:57.458
[BANGING ON WALLS]

34:12.792 --> 34:14.667
[BANGING ON WALLS]

34:17.875 --> 34:19.041
LOOK OUT!

34:19.041 --> 34:22.041
OPEN THE DOOR!

34:22.041 --> 34:23.000
BREAK IT DOWN!

34:23.000 --> 34:25.875
PACEY, BREAK IT DOWN!

34:26.792 --> 34:30.000
UNHOLY WENCH!

34:39.208 --> 34:40.333
HEY!

34:45.000 --> 34:46.208
COME ON!

34:58.083 --> 34:59.834
CAN WE PLEASE
JUST GO HOME NOW?

34:59.834 --> 35:01.166
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
IF WE HAVE TO SWIM HOME.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.542
LET'S JUST GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

35:02.542 --> 35:03.959
GUYS, THERE'S GOTTA BE
A LOGICAL EXPLANATION
FOR ALL THIS.

35:03.959 --> 35:06.041
OK, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
SEND US A POSTCARD, SPOCK,

35:06.041 --> 35:08.291
BECAUSE I, FOR ONE,
AM NOT STICKING AROUND
TO FIND OUT. COME ON!

35:21.583 --> 35:22.250
HEY, THE BOAT'S HERE.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.375
JEN, JOEY, GET THE LINE.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.125
GET IN! GET IN!

35:38.041 --> 35:39.291
Dawson: TO BE QUITE HONEST,

35:39.291 --> 35:41.125
I HAD ENVISIONED A MUCH MORE
STRAIGHTFORWARD DOCUMENTARY

35:41.125 --> 35:43.041
ON THE HISTORY
OF WITCH ISLAND,

35:43.041 --> 35:46.667
BUT I WAS SURPRISED
BY WHAT I FOUND THERE:

35:46.667 --> 35:48.583
A LOVE STORY,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

35:48.583 --> 35:52.250
2 SOUL MATES TORN APART
BY THE SOCIAL CLIMATE
OF THEIR TIME.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.834
AND WHILE WHAT HAPPENED
TO US ON THE ISLAND

35:53.834 --> 35:55.333
IS CERTAINLY OPEN
TO INTERPRETATION,

35:55.333 --> 35:57.625
THERE'S NO DISPUTING
THE FACT THAT THE ISLAND

35:57.625 --> 35:59.125
EMBODIES THE EMOTIONAL
TURMOIL OF A GIRL

35:59.125 --> 36:01.333
WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUTURE HELD FOR HER
AND THE BOY SHE LOVED.

36:01.333 --> 36:04.166
Principal Green:
IT'S NICE WORK, MR. LEERY.

36:04.166 --> 36:08.125
A TAD DERIVATIVE IN THE WAKE
OF THE WHOLE BLAIR WITCH
PHENOMENON,

36:08.125 --> 36:10.750
BUT INSPIRED WORK
NONETHELESS.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.834
I PARTICULARLY LIKED
THE PART WHEN--

36:12.834 --> 36:13.792
HEY, MAN,
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

36:13.792 --> 36:15.667
WHAT?

36:15.667 --> 36:19.291
IT LOOKS LIKE 2 PEOPLE
STANDING ON THE DOCK,
WATCHING YOU GO.

36:20.834 --> 36:23.291
SEE? LOOK CLOSE.

36:54.417 --> 36:57.834
PRINCIPAL GREEN,
WE GOT A SITUATION HERE.

36:59.708 --> 37:03.875
Andie: MILLING AND
MAKING A FILTHY DEN
IN THE LIBRARY.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.708
ONE WEEK'S DETENTION.

37:05.708 --> 37:07.083
NEXT!

37:07.083 --> 37:09.834
MISS McPHEE,
YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

37:09.834 --> 37:12.875
PRINCIPAL GREEN,
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE,
AND I RAN WITH IT.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.125
I'VE TEAMED UP WITH BELINDA,

37:14.125 --> 37:16.750
AND WE'VE TAKEN
THE FIRST STEPS
TOWARDS IMPROVING

37:16.750 --> 37:18.166
THE QUALITY OF LIFE
AT CAPESIDE.

37:18.166 --> 37:20.208
WHAT COULD ALL OF
THESE STUDENTS HAVE
POSSIBLY DONE WRONG?

37:20.208 --> 37:22.375
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM

37:22.375 --> 37:24.834
WAS IN DIRECT VIOLATION
OF THE RULES OF CONDUCT.

37:24.834 --> 37:27.542
THE RULES OF CONDUCT
WERE PREPARED IN 1957.

37:27.542 --> 37:29.625
OF COURSE THEY'RE GONNA
BE IN VIOLATION.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.333
NOW, AFTER YOU DISMISS
THESE STUDENTS,

37:31.333 --> 37:32.458
I'D LIKE YOU
TO STOP BY MY OFFICE.

37:52.583 --> 37:55.250
SO WHEN ARE WE
GONNA TALK ABOUT IT?

37:55.250 --> 37:57.792
TALK ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY?

37:57.792 --> 37:59.250
WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE.

37:59.250 --> 38:01.583
WHAT DID HAPPEN
OUT THERE, LINDLEY?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.583
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.

38:03.583 --> 38:05.250
BUT I WOULD JUST PREFER

38:05.250 --> 38:09.917
IF IT DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY
OF OUR...EXPERIMENT.

38:09.917 --> 38:11.625
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
TAKE THE SHADOWY,
ILL-EXPLAINED EVENTS

38:11.625 --> 38:15.708
OF OUR BRIEF
SOJOURN IN THE WOODS
AS SOMETHING OF AN OMEN.

38:15.708 --> 38:17.542
NO.

38:17.542 --> 38:19.458
NO?

38:19.458 --> 38:23.625
NO. IF NOTHING ELSE,
THAT GOOEY LITTLE MELODRAMA

38:23.625 --> 38:25.291
ONLY PROVES THAT LOVE
JUST MUCKS EVERYTHING UP.

38:25.291 --> 38:27.291
SO THEN YOUR
THINKING WOULD BE

38:27.291 --> 38:29.875
THAT WE SHOULD
STILL HAVE SEX?

38:29.875 --> 38:31.250
YES.

38:31.250 --> 38:35.333
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
THEN. OK.

38:41.917 --> 38:44.333
DO YOU WANNA DO IT
RIGHT NOW?

38:47.291 --> 38:50.959
UM...DO YOU?

38:50.959 --> 38:53.917
I'M KINDA TIRED,
ACTUALLY.

38:53.917 --> 38:58.208
OH, FINE. ROSWELL'S  ON
IN 5 MINUTES, ANYWAY, SO...

38:58.208 --> 39:00.083
YOU JUST LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU WANNA DO IT,

39:00.083 --> 39:04.208
AND...I'LL DO IT...TOO.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.375
OK, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT--

39:05.375 --> 39:11.875
IF I AM EVER IN THE NEED
OF A...RELEASE,

39:11.875 --> 39:15.000
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HELP ME OUT?

39:15.000 --> 39:19.125
EXACTLY. BUT KEEP IN MIND,
IT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.667
OF COURSE.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.708
WELL, THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC.

39:23.708 --> 39:24.834
DOESN'T IT?

39:24.834 --> 39:26.667
IT DOES.
GOOD.

39:26.667 --> 39:29.000
SHOULD WE, I DON'T KNOW,
SHOULD WE KISS ON THAT?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.625
NO.
NO?

39:30.625 --> 39:33.625
KISSING IS INTIMATE,
AND--AND WE'RE NOT ABOUT
INTIMACY.

39:33.625 --> 39:37.333
PERHAPS WE SHOULD JUST
SHAKE ON IT, THEN.

39:40.542 --> 39:41.542
SHAKEN.

39:41.542 --> 39:42.708
GREAT.

39:42.708 --> 39:43.959
IT'S GOOD SEEIN' YA.

39:43.959 --> 39:47.667
WHO ELSE COULD IT BE OTHER THAN
WENDY AND THAT BOAT GUY?

39:47.667 --> 39:49.500
HE'S A GUY, SHE'S A GIRL.
THEY BOTH HAD ACCESS
TO THE ISLAND.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.500
THEY LEFT THE BOAT
OUT THERE FOR US.

39:51.500 --> 39:55.000
I MEAN, IT'S THE ONLY
POSSIBLE EXPLANATION.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.083
THE ONLY POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION?

39:58.083 --> 40:00.917
LET'S HEAR YOUR VERSION.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.542
OK. THE GIRL'S
MARY WALDECK,

40:02.542 --> 40:05.625
AND THE GUY'S
WILLIAM BENNETT.

40:05.625 --> 40:07.417
LOOK AT THOSE CLOTHES
AND THAT HAT.

40:07.417 --> 40:09.959
THOSE ARE
17th-CENTURY CLOTHES
IF I'VE EVER SEEN THEM.

40:09.959 --> 40:11.792
I THINK THE CRACK HABIT HAS
DEFINITELY COME BETWEEN YOU

40:11.792 --> 40:12.667
AND YOUR COGNITIVE POWERS,
DAWSON.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.500
OBVIOUSLY WENDY
AND THE BOAT GUY

40:14.500 --> 40:18.291
WERE SCREWING WITH US
THE WHOLE TIME.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.542
SKEPTIC.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.917
SUCKER.

40:20.917 --> 40:21.917
CYNIC.

40:21.917 --> 40:23.125
GULLIBLE.

40:24.583 --> 40:27.250
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:27.250 --> 40:31.166
MAYBE WE'VE SEEN THE WORLD
ACCORDING TO DAWSON
ONE TOO MANY TIMES.

40:31.166 --> 40:35.166
MAYBE I SHOULD STEP OUT OF
THE MOVIE THEATER AND INTO
THE HARSH LIGHT OF DAY.

40:37.083 --> 40:40.083
I DON'T KNOW, DAWSON.
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:40.083 --> 40:43.959
MAYBE WILLIAM AND MARY FOUND
THEIR WAY BACK TO EACH OTHER
AFTER ALL.

40:47.041 --> 40:49.250
YA THINK?

40:49.250 --> 40:51.625
IT'S JUST A THOUGHT.

40:54.166 --> 40:57.291
JOEY, I WANNA APOLOGIZE.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.542
FOR WHAT?

40:59.542 --> 41:02.458
FOR TAKING OUR FRIENDSHIP
FOR GRANTED.

41:02.458 --> 41:04.166
IT WAS WRONG TO THINK
WE COULD JUST PICK UP

41:04.166 --> 41:05.667
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

41:09.959 --> 41:12.834
WELL, IT'S NOT ENTIRELY
YOUR FAULT, DAWSON.

41:12.834 --> 41:14.291
I MEAN, LOOK AT US.

41:14.291 --> 41:18.792
WE'VE SPENT YEARS
INTELLECTUALIZING
EVERY LITTLE FEELING,

41:18.792 --> 41:20.750
AND IT DOESN'T COUNT
FOR ANYTHING.

41:20.750 --> 41:24.417
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS WHAT WE DO,

41:24.417 --> 41:27.458
HOW WE TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER, SO...

41:29.041 --> 41:31.750
SO LET'S NOT
TALK THIS TO DEATH.

41:31.750 --> 41:36.291
LET'S TAKE IT SLOW AND...

41:36.291 --> 41:40.000
CHECK IN WITH EACH OTHER
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

41:41.792 --> 41:44.375
THAT SOUNDS
IMMENSELY DOABLE.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.625
GOOD.

41:53.458 --> 41:57.583
I THINK THIS IS ONE X-FILE
WE'RE NEVER GONNA CLOSE.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.875
WELL, NOT UNLESS
WE GO BACK.

42:00.875 --> 42:03.834
NO.

42:03.834 --> 42:05.750
COME ON, JOEY,
THE SEQUEL.

42:08.333 --> 42:11.625
LET'S JUST SEE HOW
THIS ONE OPENS FIRST.

42:14.667 --> 42:17.917
BY THE WAY, HOW DID YOU
DO ON YOUR PSATs?

42:23.333 --> 42:24.708
BRILLIANTLY.

42:32.125 --> 42:34.166
WATCH OUT.
