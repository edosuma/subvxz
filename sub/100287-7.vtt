-Hello?
-[Eadie]<i> Hey, it's me.</i>

01:06.667 --> 01:08.667
Are you home?

01:10.228 --> 01:11.288
I'm out in the middle of it.

01:11.388 --> 01:12.488
-[Eadie] Can you get home?

01:12.588 --> 01:13.568
-[Lloyd]<i> Why?</i>

01:13.668 --> 01:14.648
[baby crying]

01:14.748 --> 01:16.749
-[Eadie] That's an interesting question.

01:20.149 --> 01:21.290
-[Lloyd]<i> It's a simple question.</i>

01:21.390 --> 01:23.650
-[Eadie]<i> Not so simple to answer.</i>
<i>I've,</i> um...

01:23.750 --> 01:26.171
I've got myself into a bit of a situation.

01:26.271 --> 01:28.351
-[Lloyd]<i> Oh, well, that's</i>
<i>not like you, Eadie.</i>

01:29.551 --> 01:31.552
-[Eadie]<i> No, not like me.</i>

01:32.992 --> 01:35.432
-[Eadie]<i> But this one thing's happened</i>

01:37.393 --> 01:39.673

01:44.554 --> 01:46.554
I need you on my team, baby.

01:48.595 --> 01:50.595
Lloyd, are you still there?

01:53.276 --> 01:54.416
-[Eadie]<i> Lloyd?</i>

01:54.516 --> 01:56.516
I know it was Shay that helped you.

01:57.036 --> 01:59.317
-[woman] Eadie, we've got to ditch
the phones.

02:04.438 --> 02:06.438

This is where you guys are going to sleep.

03:22.172 --> 03:23.272
Did you get onto Abel?

03:23.372 --> 03:24.352
He didn't pick up.

03:24.452 --> 03:26.473
-'Cause he didn't recognise the number.
-Yeah, or he's been arrested.

-[man] Lloyd!

03:40.695 --> 03:42.396
[baby cries]

03:42.496 --> 03:43.556
Quick, come in, come in.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.656
Hey. Is he here?

03:48.617 --> 03:50.277
[exhales deeply]

03:50.377 --> 03:51.798
-[Eadie]<i> I don't understand.</i>

03:51.898 --> 03:52.918
Why would you give them your work?

03:53.018 --> 03:55.018
She had me in a corner.

03:56.298 --> 04:00.459
Either I gave her what she wanted
or she burned your marriage and...

04:01.859 --> 04:04.680
...bombed my relationship
with Lloyd to the ground.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.560
Which has...

04:06.660 --> 04:08.661
...pretty much happened anyway.

04:10.061 --> 04:12.061
I was trying to protect you.

04:13.942 --> 04:16.202
How did she know? We were so careful.

04:16.302 --> 04:17.922
She data mined me.

04:18.022 --> 04:20.423
She had all our texts, our Uber rides.

04:22.023 --> 04:26.624
Our meeting down at the harbour,
my trip down to the resettlement centre.

04:28.304 --> 04:29.565
Why would she do that?

04:29.665 --> 04:30.645
She was looking

04:30.745 --> 04:32.745
for my weak spot.

04:35.346 --> 04:37.346
She found you.

04:43.507 --> 04:44.487
I'm sorry.

04:44.587 --> 04:46.588
[dog barks]

04:47.188 --> 04:49.188
I'm sorry I asked you.

04:49.948 --> 04:51.949
I'm sorry I said yes.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.310
That poor kid. He had the jab for nothing.

05:06.111 --> 05:08.112
Will you let Lloyd know that I came by?

05:09.072 --> 05:11.072
Yeah.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.396
[beep]

05:34.357 --> 05:35.817
-[Carl] Hey, Dom. How's the water?

05:35.917 --> 05:37.297
Yeah, it's alright.

05:37.397 --> 05:40.978
I got your message about the evacuation
at the old people's home.

05:41.078 --> 05:42.338
Yeah.

05:42.438 --> 05:44.619
Yeah, state services
just can't manage it in the time needed

05:44.719 --> 05:46.859
and we've get those old folks
out of there ASAP.

05:46.959 --> 05:49.579
OK. Well, yeah. I'm going in with a team
first thing in the morning.

05:49.679 --> 05:50.980
-[Dom] So, I'll sign off on it personally.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.580
I appreciate you really just jumping in
at such short notice.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.821
-[Dom] No worries.

05:55.921 --> 05:57.021
Actually, did you...

05:57.121 --> 05:59.781
Did you ever buy those Lindriquil shares?

05:59.881 --> 06:02.502
Yeah, but I reckon I've probably lost
my money there. Right?

06:02.602 --> 06:04.922
Ah... I dunno. You could hang onto them
a bit longer.

06:06.042 --> 06:09.463
I pitched that idea I had about
a second life for the project to the party

06:09.563 --> 06:12.104
and that they had
a very favourable response.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.264
Really?

06:14.364 --> 06:17.185
I can't see a world where those fertility
results don't sink the whole thing.

06:17.285 --> 06:18.265
-[Carl] Careful messaging.

06:18.365 --> 06:20.365
Lean into the positives.

06:20.925 --> 06:22.426
-[Carl] Look out. Here's trouble.

06:22.526 --> 06:24.526
Hello, darling. Good night, mate.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.146
-[Carl] How are you?
-[woman] Good.

06:27.246 --> 06:29.247
[kiss]

06:31.607 --> 06:34.608
[basketball bouncing loudly]

06:37.928 --> 06:40.929
[ticking]

06:49.811 --> 06:51.811
-[Archie] This is bullshit.

06:52.331 --> 06:54.511
Your clock is bullshit.

06:54.611 --> 06:57.252
Face it, Archie. We're the new dinosaurs.

06:58.532 --> 07:01.013
One day, some alien life form
will come down to what's left of Earth,

07:02.173 --> 07:03.353
reassemble your bones

07:03.453 --> 07:05.454
and put them in a museum.

07:07.654 --> 07:08.954
You idiot!

07:09.054 --> 07:10.634
-[Sage] Mum, Archie and Cosmo
are fighting again!

07:10.734 --> 07:12.195
-[Francesca] Boys!
-[Archie] You're so stupid!

07:12.295 --> 07:13.955
[Cosmo] He broke my clock!

07:14.055 --> 07:15.195
You're a freak! A total freak! I hate you!

07:15.295 --> 07:17.296
[Francesca] Boys! Archie!

07:19.096 --> 07:21.096
[Francesca] Oh, god.

07:23.457 --> 07:25.457
What's this?

07:25.897 --> 07:28.998
[Francesca] Cosmo has designed and built

07:29.098 --> 07:30.478
his very own doomsday clock.

07:30.578 --> 07:31.638
These are all the things

07:31.738 --> 07:32.919
that humans have done

07:33.019 --> 07:35.519
that will lead to our destruction.

07:35.619 --> 07:38.620
Barrier Reef trashed, Ross Ice Sheet gone.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.000
Is it for school?

07:41.100 --> 07:43.100
[Francesca] No.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.421
Self-starter.

07:47.421 --> 07:49.422
Jesus.

08:01.384 --> 08:03.384
Hey, buddy. You OK?

08:04.264 --> 08:06.125
Just try and calm down.

08:06.225 --> 08:08.965
Breathe in through the nose,
out through the mouth.

08:09.065 --> 08:10.966
That's it. In, out.

08:11.066 --> 08:14.326
Nice and slow. In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

08:14.426 --> 08:16.427
[exhales]
There you go. In...

08:17.547 --> 08:19.167
Out...
[exhales deeply]

08:19.267 --> 08:21.268
There you go. Sit down.

08:23.868 --> 08:26.209
That's it. That's it.

08:26.309 --> 08:28.449
OK?

08:28.549 --> 08:30.549
Better?

08:30.949 --> 08:32.950
Good man.

08:34.590 --> 08:36.590
Now, listen. I know all this...

08:37.671 --> 08:40.191
end of the universe stuff
is hard to ignore but...

08:41.111 --> 08:42.412
You've got to try not to focus
on it so much,

08:42.512 --> 08:45.352
otherwise it's just going to end up
making you depressed.

08:46.232 --> 08:47.412
[whispered] I'm not depressed.

08:47.512 --> 08:49.453
-What?
-I'm not depressed.

08:49.553 --> 08:51.693
What makes you think I'm depressed?

08:51.793 --> 08:53.794
Well, you know, the clock.

08:54.874 --> 08:57.274
Some people might find that
a bit... alarming.

08:58.074 --> 09:01.815
Yeah. If you're Archie
and you want to live for 100 years.

09:01.915 --> 09:04.776
There's nothing wrong with Archie
wanting to live for 100 years, is there?

09:04.876 --> 09:06.876
It's not right.

09:08.196 --> 09:10.017
Wanting something you can't have.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.117
That's what makes you depressed.

09:14.037 --> 09:18.118
There's nothing to worry about
if you just accepted things as they are.

09:22.439 --> 09:26.480
Right. Well, I'm glad you're not worried.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.920
I do worry.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.221
I worry about you.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.321
Me? You don't need to worry about me.
I'm fine.

09:35.321 --> 09:38.342
You know, I'm back in the pool again,
I'm doing laps.

09:38.442 --> 09:40.442
My health's settled down.

09:41.042 --> 09:43.483
Hey. I'm fine.

09:45.123 --> 09:47.524
If you just weren't running
around trying to fix everything.

09:49.924 --> 09:51.924
What would happen if you just stopped?

09:54.325 --> 09:56.325
[beeping]

10:16.609 --> 10:19.610
[drone buzzing]

10:29.211 --> 10:31.232
[knock on door]
[door opens]

10:31.332 --> 10:33.452
Night-night, Ive.
Thanks for all your help.

10:35.573 --> 10:36.873
Heard from Dad yet?

10:36.973 --> 10:39.253
I think he's working late.

10:44.054 --> 10:46.054
[Lloyd on phone]<i> Tricky things, parasites,</i>
<i>poppet.</i>

10:47.495 --> 10:49.475
Hardest diseases to solve.

10:49.575 --> 10:54.996
Because the parasite changes
its structural shape so much.

10:55.096 --> 10:59.477
[Lloyd]<i> More than 20 times, this one,</i>
<i>in the course of the infection period,</i>

10:59.577 --> 11:01.197
<i>so what we really need is a vax</i>

11:01.297 --> 11:03.238
<i>that can fight against</i>
<i>all those shifting shapes.</i>

11:03.338 --> 11:04.598
<i>The thing that I'm still trying to crack</i>

11:04.698 --> 11:07.338
is how come the kissing bug...

11:09.299 --> 11:12.099
...is immune to all of them
'cause it doesn't die of Chagas.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.580
[Lloyd]<i> And if I can figure out</i>
<i>what that thing is then...</i>

11:16.500 --> 11:19.301
...well, maybe I can create
a cure for humans.

11:21.501 --> 11:22.481
Not that we have

11:22.581 --> 11:24.002
<i>that much in common</i>
<i>with the kissing bug--</i>

11:24.102 --> 11:25.082
Dad.

11:25.182 --> 11:27.182
[Lloyd]<i> Yes, poppet.</i>

11:27.542 --> 11:29.543
Come home.

11:30.383 --> 11:32.383
[Ivy]<i> Please.</i>

11:37.464 --> 11:39.324
[Israel] Appreciate you letting us
be here.

11:39.424 --> 11:41.445
[Lloyd] Oh, that's the least we can do.
It's all good.

11:41.545 --> 11:43.545
[Israel] Thank you.

11:43.945 --> 11:45.606
[Rima] Come. Come to bed.

11:45.706 --> 11:49.586
[indistinct conversation]

[tender music]

12:37.955 --> 12:39.956
[door opens]

12:45.597 --> 12:47.497
[Lloyd] Pretty full house downstairs.

12:47.597 --> 12:49.697
Yep.

12:49.797 --> 12:52.018
That's what I was calling you about.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.478
Had to make
a spur of the moment decision.

12:57.599 --> 12:59.599
You OK with it?

13:03.760 --> 13:05.760
Yeah.

13:07.601 --> 13:09.601
I guess I have to be though.

13:19.403 --> 13:21.403
[Abel]<i> Border Authority</i>
<i>don't know how you got away.</i>

13:21.923 --> 13:23.704
I managed to delete the CCTV.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.484
They suspect I'm involved.
It's safe to say, we don't have much time.

13:27.684 --> 13:29.545
I've reached out to some church folk
who'll provide sanctuary

13:29.645 --> 13:30.945
for people in your situation.

13:31.045 --> 13:32.345
Just call this number, mention my name,

13:32.445 --> 13:33.946
they might be able to help you.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.586
[Rima] Come they help us
get out of the country?

13:35.686 --> 13:37.866
-What are you talking about, Rima?
-New Zealand is still taking refugees.

13:37.966 --> 13:40.187
[Israel] I have a job here. OK?

13:40.287 --> 13:41.987
We have to go back
through the proper channels.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.587
We've done proper channels.

13:43.687 --> 13:45.708
Look where it got us.

13:45.808 --> 13:47.908
What about your brother?

13:48.008 --> 13:49.669
-Dom?
-[Israel] He's friends with the minister.

13:49.769 --> 13:51.769
[Abel] As of yesterday,
we've all crossed the line.

13:53.729 --> 13:56.010
Right now, we can't trust anyone
outside of this table.

14:01.611 --> 14:03.111
-[Eadie] You OK?
-[Rima] Yeah, I'm OK.

14:03.211 --> 14:05.752
-[Rima] It's alright.
-[Eadie] Sorry, just give me a minute.

14:05.852 --> 14:07.852
Hey.

14:11.093 --> 14:12.593
Look, this...

14:12.693 --> 14:14.633
This isn't Shay's fault.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.734
I dragged him into it because...

14:17.574 --> 14:19.574
Because?

14:21.214 --> 14:23.215
Because you gave up.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.615
And I couldn't.

14:28.016 --> 14:30.116
And...

14:30.216 --> 14:32.036
I knew I couldn't get you to agree
to the risk,

14:32.136 --> 14:36.737
so I guess, a part of me gave up on you.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.078
But that was my fault, not Shay's

14:39.178 --> 14:41.758
and if I could go back and do it over,

14:41.858 --> 14:45.439
I would've just been brave enough
to have the conversation with you

14:45.539 --> 14:49.600
and face the fact
that you might've said no

14:49.700 --> 14:54.021
and that I might have to say
I was going ahead without you.

14:56.821 --> 14:59.261
I regret that, Lloyd, and I am so sorry.

15:01.102 --> 15:02.202
But I can't regret this.

15:02.302 --> 15:06.063
[bittersweet music]

15:12.264 --> 15:14.264
What?

15:17.025 --> 15:19.025
I think I just felt them.

15:26.106 --> 15:28.107
Still haven't said hello.

15:34.428 --> 15:36.608
[Lloyd] Hello.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.709
[Lloyd] Plural.

15:41.589 --> 15:44.510
They say, "What else you got, Dad?"

15:52.231 --> 15:53.772
[Lloyd] I can't do this right now, Eadie.

15:53.872 --> 15:55.872
I can't.

16:02.073 --> 16:04.394
[gate opens and closes]

16:06.514 --> 16:08.174
[female reporter]<i> Activation</i>
<i>of this city's heatwave plan</i>

16:08.274 --> 16:09.254
<i>kicked off this morning...</i>

16:09.354 --> 16:11.455
[male reporter]<i> Exclusive residences</i>
<i>will throw open</i>

16:11.555 --> 16:13.455
<i>their doors to the public as the mayor...</i>

16:13.555 --> 16:15.056
[female reporter]<i> ...five-star luxury</i>

16:15.156 --> 16:16.816
<i>as the city's wealthy are forced</i>
<i>to share</i> a seat...

16:16.916 --> 16:19.536
[male reporter]<i> ...going ahead today.</i>
<i>Look out for the red heat refuge tickets</i>

16:19.636 --> 16:21.137
<i>and help yourself to a dose</i>

16:21.237 --> 16:23.137
<i>-...during the hottest hours...</i>
-[man]<i> Welcome to Stonehewen!</i>

16:23.237 --> 16:26.178
Please confine yourselves
within the foyer area!

16:26.278 --> 16:30.338
The upper floors are not accessible
to members of the public!

16:30.438 --> 16:32.819
Residents and signed-in visitors only.

16:32.919 --> 16:35.899
[Carl] Got your work cut out
for you today, Israel.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.540
Opening the doors to the public,
Mr. Anderson.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.940
It's very civic minded
of the body corporate.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.340
We didn't actually have a choice.
It's state bloody policy.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.441
Yeah, whose stupid idea was that?

16:44.281 --> 16:45.781
Stay hydrated, gentlemen.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.022
Carl.

16:47.122 --> 16:49.102
These people, they can't just go
anywhere, right?

16:49.202 --> 16:52.302
The foyer and the internal vestibule
are public access only

16:52.402 --> 16:54.403
and the rest is off-limits.

16:55.003 --> 16:57.683
Don't worry, sir. I'll make sure
they stay off the grass.

17:00.084 --> 17:02.084
Sir.

17:02.684 --> 17:04.685
I wanted to have a word with you.

17:06.245 --> 17:08.445
My family's residency application
fell through.

17:09.846 --> 17:11.146
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:11.246 --> 17:13.106
Even though we had
all of the required points,

17:13.206 --> 17:14.547
they still rejected our application.

17:14.647 --> 17:16.027
That's shit news, mate.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.367
-I wish there was something I could do.
-Well, actually, Mr. Boulay, there is.

17:19.888 --> 17:23.188
Domestic Affairs
has Mr. Anderson's portfolio.

17:23.288 --> 17:24.909
It's not my place to ask

17:25.009 --> 17:26.149
but you and him are friends.

17:26.249 --> 17:28.249
Yeah, it doesn't really work like that.

17:29.289 --> 17:32.470
My son, Leroy, even took part
in this trial for this new Chagas vaccine,

17:32.570 --> 17:36.171
even though the side-effects for this drug
means that he may never have children.

17:37.011 --> 17:39.691
But just to get an edge
on his permit points.

17:41.212 --> 17:42.912
Look, if the right moment comes up...

17:43.012 --> 17:45.012
No, I'm going to need more than that, sir.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.313
Look, thanks to your sister,

17:48.413 --> 17:50.713
we're not in as much trouble
as we could be.

17:50.813 --> 17:52.674
OK, we have a reprieve.

17:52.774 --> 17:54.954
But unless someone higher up
takes interest

17:55.054 --> 17:56.754
then things are going to be bad for us

17:56.854 --> 18:00.535
and if they're bad for us,
then they're bad for Ms Boulay also.

18:09.817 --> 18:12.617
[baby crying]

18:15.978 --> 18:17.978
I think he's running a temp.

18:18.418 --> 18:19.999
It's hard to tell 'cause it's so hot.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.359
Is he drinking enough water?

18:21.459 --> 18:23.399
Not enough.

18:23.499 --> 18:26.260
Not his usual self. Hasn't bitten me once.

18:28.780 --> 18:30.781
Could you just grab some water
and a sponge?

18:32.741 --> 18:35.022
Keep his fluids up, keep him cool.

18:35.702 --> 18:36.882
I'm sure he'll be fine.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.982
OK.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.443
[baby chatters]

18:41.543 --> 18:43.543
Hey.

18:45.544 --> 18:48.544
[drone whirring]

18:51.305 --> 18:53.305
[generator starts]

19:02.027 --> 19:04.087

19:04.187 --> 19:06.447
[Eadie]<i> Hey, there. Sorry I can't take</i>
<i>your call right now.</i>

19:06.547 --> 19:07.528
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

19:07.628 --> 19:08.848
Hey, sis.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.208
Still trying to get in touch with you.

19:10.308 --> 19:12.308
You know why. Call me back.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.190
[generator humming]

19:52.436 --> 19:54.436
God almighty.

20:25.042 --> 20:27.042
Hello?

20:28.803 --> 20:30.803
Shit.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.444
Hello?

20:40.965 --> 20:42.965
Jesus.

20:43.805 --> 20:45.866
Hello? Can I get some help
in here, please?

20:45.966 --> 20:48.066
Some water!

20:48.166 --> 20:50.167
You must be thirsty.

20:50.887 --> 20:52.027
Um, Janice, is it?

20:52.127 --> 20:53.307
I'm Dom.

20:53.407 --> 20:55.588
We're moving everybody out of here.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.308
We're going to take you to a new facility.

20:57.408 --> 20:58.708
Just leave me.

20:58.808 --> 21:00.109
I can't leave you. There's not going

21:00.209 --> 21:01.469
to be anyone here to look after you.

21:01.569 --> 21:03.749
Please.

21:03.849 --> 21:05.850
Any decent person would...

21:06.210 --> 21:08.210
...just leave me be.

21:13.571 --> 21:14.631
Girls, come here.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.592
I need you to have some water, please.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.712
Thanks.

21:17.812 --> 21:18.952
You've got to stay hydrated.

21:19.052 --> 21:20.352
Good girl. There you go.

21:20.452 --> 21:21.673
All that liquid going in,

21:21.773 --> 21:22.993
not much coming out.

21:23.093 --> 21:25.493
I haven't seen them
go to the bathroom all day.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.054
It's OK. They go in the pool. We all do.

21:43.857 --> 21:44.837
Hey, Cos.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.937
-Yeah.
-Do you like it here?

21:51.898 --> 21:54.079
Of course.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.179
It's got everything you could ever want.

22:01.380 --> 22:02.960
Whoo-hoo!

22:03.060 --> 22:05.081
[Archie] Hey! Hey!

22:05.181 --> 22:06.641
Only Stonehewen residents
are allowed in here.

22:06.741 --> 22:08.201
-You need to leave.
-Archie, leave it.

22:08.301 --> 22:09.601
-I said, get out!
-Archie, back off!

22:09.701 --> 22:11.002
I don't care! They don't even live here!

22:11.102 --> 22:12.202
[woman] Jessie! What did I tell you

22:12.302 --> 22:13.882
about wandering off? Come out.

22:13.982 --> 22:15.643
Come out! I'm so sorry
if they're bothering you.

22:15.743 --> 22:18.243
No, really. It's fine. Honestly. In fact,
why don't you just stay and have a dip?

22:18.343 --> 22:19.563
Oh, thank you. No, but we can't.

22:19.663 --> 22:20.803
No, really.

22:20.903 --> 22:22.924
You'd be doing me a favour if you did.
Oh, Israel.

22:23.024 --> 22:25.284
Um... It's fine. What's your name?

22:25.384 --> 22:26.485
-Kirsty.
-Kirsty and her children

22:26.585 --> 22:28.585
are my guests.

22:29.105 --> 22:31.105
OK.

22:31.425 --> 22:32.566
[Kirsty] Thank you so much.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.666
[Francesca] You're welcome.

22:36.826 --> 22:38.827
[insects buzzing]

22:44.268 --> 22:46.268
[bangs on glass]
Oi!

22:46.708 --> 22:48.409
What do you think you're doing?

22:48.509 --> 22:51.409
Lloyd, I'm sorry we didn't get to talk
before these gentlemen turned up.

22:51.509 --> 22:52.489
What is going on here?

22:52.589 --> 22:55.190
NIS will no longer provide funding
for your Chagas research.

22:57.150 --> 22:58.731
You... You're cutting my funding?

22:58.831 --> 23:00.331
I'm sorry, Lloyd. I know how committed
you are.

23:00.431 --> 23:02.131
You can't do this, Herm. You can't.

23:02.231 --> 23:03.211
I'm making real progress here.

23:03.311 --> 23:05.312
The board's made its decision.
It's out of my hands.

23:06.272 --> 23:09.212
We'll need you to clear out your lab
and insectaries by week's end.

23:09.312 --> 23:11.553
OK, good. Then this is still mine
until then.

23:13.033 --> 23:15.034
Thanks, Herman.

23:35.797 --> 23:37.658
[Shay]<i> They brought Marco into it.</i>

23:37.758 --> 23:39.338
Sorry, what?

23:39.438 --> 23:41.618
Marco. My... The...

23:41.718 --> 23:43.419
The kid I had with Elena.

23:43.519 --> 23:44.859
[Eadie]<i> Oh, yeah, sorry.</i>

23:44.959 --> 23:47.780
It's just it's, um, it's been a while.

23:47.880 --> 23:48.980
Eight years, if you're counting.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.080
But my point is they tried to get
at me with Marco first.

23:52.641 --> 23:54.021
Ah...

23:54.121 --> 23:55.381
Who... Who tried?

23:55.481 --> 23:57.341
[Shay]<i> Lindriquil.</i>

23:57.441 --> 23:58.622
I'm not following.

23:58.722 --> 24:01.462
OK. I've done enough dodgy shit

24:01.562 --> 24:03.463
in my time that if they wanted
to blackmail me,

24:03.563 --> 24:06.343
they could go with some or all of it.
But they didn't. They...

24:06.443 --> 24:09.084
They went personal instead of criminal.

24:11.164 --> 24:13.184
They are zeroed in on Marco
and when...

24:13.284 --> 24:14.865
I didn't bite, they went with you.

24:14.965 --> 24:16.305
[baby crying]
[siren]

24:16.405 --> 24:18.185
[Shay]<i> But the more I think about it,</i>
<i>it doesn't make any sense.</i>

24:18.285 --> 24:19.786
It's too targeted. Did you say anything
to anyone

24:19.886 --> 24:21.886
about what you and I were up to?

24:25.927 --> 24:27.467
Eadie, did anyone else know?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.567
[siren]

24:30.087 --> 24:31.148
Ah, no.

24:31.248 --> 24:33.248
[Eadie]<i> No one. Just Dom.</i>
[hangs up]

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
-Jesus.
-We need to talk!

25:01.773 --> 25:04.034
-Get out of the way, Shay.
-I'm not going anywhere, Lloyd,

25:04.134 --> 25:07.574
until you listen to what I have to say.
Carl Anderson, Karima Kahn, Herman.

25:09.215 --> 25:11.715
Listen to me. The Minister
of Domestic Affairs

25:11.815 --> 25:13.195
-in bed with Lindriquil--
-Move.

25:13.295 --> 25:14.276
Herman playing Cupid.

25:14.376 --> 25:16.436
They were sitting on each other's laps
through the whole presentation.

25:16.536 --> 25:18.597
We missed the whole thing.
Jesus Christ, Lloyd.

25:18.697 --> 25:20.797
Will you get over your hurt? Five seconds.

25:20.897 --> 25:22.877
Listen to what I have--

25:22.977 --> 25:24.638
OK. Lloyd, if you want to hit me, hit me.

25:24.738 --> 25:26.738
You went behind my back with my wife.

25:27.938 --> 25:29.519
I made a choice to help her.

25:29.619 --> 25:31.619
Your choice could've killed her.

25:32.459 --> 25:33.879
But I get why you did it.

25:33.979 --> 25:36.380
That would've felt pretty good
to give her something that I wouldn't.

25:37.860 --> 25:39.860
'Cause I know how you feel
about her, Shay, I know.

25:41.381 --> 25:43.321
But Jesus, then you sell me out
to Lindriquil,

25:43.421 --> 25:45.241
so what are you trying to do?
You trying to sink my whole boat?

25:45.341 --> 25:47.402
I only sold them something
you put in the bin

25:47.502 --> 25:48.522
to try and protect her

25:48.622 --> 25:51.423
and whether you believe it or not, Lloyd,
I was trying to protect you too.

25:52.943 --> 25:54.323
Karima knew I tried to help Eadie.

25:54.423 --> 25:57.384
Do you know the only other person
that knew I tried to help her? Dom.

25:58.304 --> 25:59.684
Dom lives in Stonehewen, yeah?

25:59.784 --> 26:01.084
Guess where Carl Anderson lives.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.485
Where are you going with this, Shay?

26:02.585 --> 26:04.405
Have you got Leroy's test results?

26:04.505 --> 26:06.285
Yeah. Yeah, they came back positive.

26:06.385 --> 26:07.486
OK.

26:07.586 --> 26:09.046
Well, you need the other 499

26:09.146 --> 26:11.346
because I don't trust Lindriquil
to not roll out regardless.

26:12.707 --> 26:14.707
Right. Good luck getting those results.

26:15.707 --> 26:19.068
Maybe you could say please really sweetly
and Karima will give them to you.

26:21.388 --> 26:24.069
[tyres screeching]

26:33.670 --> 26:34.971
Barney!

26:35.071 --> 26:36.251
Barney!

26:36.351 --> 26:38.351
Barney!

26:40.312 --> 26:41.812
No. No.

26:41.912 --> 26:43.492
You don't even know
what I'm going to ask you.

26:43.592 --> 26:44.572
I don't want to know.

26:44.672 --> 26:46.093
It's just a little data mining job.

26:46.193 --> 26:48.833
-It's illegal. It's illegal.
-Mate, mate.

26:53.074 --> 26:54.934
Excuse me, sir.

26:55.034 --> 26:56.575
If he could stay within the foyer area,
please.

26:56.675 --> 26:58.915
There's seats on the other side as well.
[phone ringing]

27:01.396 --> 27:02.496
Rima, what is it?

27:02.596 --> 27:03.816
[Rima]<i> They want money.</i>

27:03.916 --> 27:06.016
What? What for? I thought they were
a charity organisation.

27:06.116 --> 27:07.097
[Rima]<i> False documentation,</i>

27:09.477 --> 27:10.617
[Israel]<i> How much?</i>

27:10.717 --> 27:12.718
10,000. Each.

27:13.878 --> 27:15.938
What are we going to do?

27:16.038 --> 27:18.219
Israel? Can you have someone
check on my car?

27:18.319 --> 27:20.059
-Your... Your car, ma'am?
-I want to make sure it's safe.

27:20.159 --> 27:22.740
There's people everywhere
and I left the top down.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.840
Rima, can I call you back?

27:30.921 --> 27:33.201
Where am I going to get $50,000 in cash?

27:34.962 --> 27:36.102
We'll work something out.

27:36.202 --> 27:38.202
Steal it if we have to.

27:38.883 --> 27:40.883
[distant sirens]

27:48.524 --> 27:49.905
[Dom] OK, Janice,

27:50.005 --> 27:51.225
favourite decade.

27:51.325 --> 27:52.785
Must've been the swinging '60s, right?

27:52.885 --> 27:53.985
Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger.

27:54.085 --> 27:56.086
Woodstock.

27:56.566 --> 27:58.566
Too much bad sex.

27:58.966 --> 28:00.347
Husband number one.

28:00.447 --> 28:03.427
Couldn't get no satisfaction, eh? [laughs]

28:03.527 --> 28:05.548
Husband number two.

28:05.648 --> 28:07.648
Really?

28:09.168 --> 28:10.468
I hope you satisfy

28:10.568 --> 28:12.569
your wife.

28:14.169 --> 28:16.169
Yeah, I hope so too.

28:20.130 --> 28:22.131
You're a good man.

28:46.375 --> 28:49.376
[phone ringing]

28:51.376 --> 28:53.076
Dominic Boulay speaking.

28:53.176 --> 28:54.157
[Eadie]<i> It's me.</i>

28:54.257 --> 28:55.437
Eadie, where the hell have you been?

28:55.537 --> 28:56.917
I been trying to get in touch
with you all day.

28:57.017 --> 28:58.437
What is this? A new number
or something?

28:58.537 --> 28:59.558
Bit of a story there.

28:59.658 --> 29:02.038
Look, you know you offered me
the money for IVF.

29:02.138 --> 29:04.238
I just, I wondered
if you'd still be open...

29:04.338 --> 29:06.779
[baby crying]
...to loaning me a similar amount.

29:08.259 --> 29:10.119
[Eadie]<i> I need 50,000, Dom.</i>

29:10.219 --> 29:11.640
<i>For a very good cause.</i>

29:11.740 --> 29:12.840
This wouldn't have anything to do

29:12.940 --> 29:14.520
with my concierge and his family,
would it?

29:14.620 --> 29:15.761
[baby crying]

29:15.861 --> 29:18.641
[Dom]<i> Whatever it is you're up to, Eadie,</i>
<i>stop it.</i>

29:18.741 --> 29:20.361
They don't deserve the hand
they've been dealt.

29:20.461 --> 29:21.962
[Eadie]<i> It's 50 grand, Dom.</i>

29:22.062 --> 29:24.322
<i>You burn that kind of money on a holiday.</i>

29:24.422 --> 29:25.442
Do you want to go to jail?

29:25.542 --> 29:26.803
[baby crying]

29:26.903 --> 29:28.903
[Dom]<i> Ead?</i>

29:32.984 --> 29:34.724
[exhales]

29:34.824 --> 29:38.225
Well, Janice, I'm afraid I've completely
failed you on the tea front.

29:46.186 --> 29:48.187
Janice?

30:15.072 --> 30:16.572
[Kirsty]<i> Yeah, I went there</i>
<i>on my gap year.</i>

30:16.672 --> 30:17.932
No way. Me too and then to Greece.

30:18.032 --> 30:20.032
-Then to Greece.
-[laughs]

30:20.713 --> 30:23.933
Then I hitched to Spain,
slept under boats on the beach,

30:24.033 --> 30:26.854
ate baguettes and sardines for dinner
for a whole month.

30:26.954 --> 30:28.414
Then onto

30:28.514 --> 30:29.734
Majorca...

30:29.834 --> 30:31.835
...and I met Dom.

30:38.636 --> 30:40.616
[Francesca] Are we actually going to burst
into flames?

30:40.716 --> 30:42.717
[Kirsty] Maybe.
[phone ringing]

30:43.317 --> 30:45.177
[phone ringing]

30:45.277 --> 30:47.278
Hey?

30:48.318 --> 30:49.338
[Francesca]<i> Dom?</i>

30:49.438 --> 30:50.578
I'm having a bit of a crap day.

30:50.678 --> 30:51.658
[Archie] Get out! Come on!

30:51.758 --> 30:52.779
Get out!

30:52.879 --> 30:53.899
[Francesca] Archie!

30:53.999 --> 30:56.299
[Archie] You guys don't live here.
You have to leave.

30:56.399 --> 30:58.400
God, he's a mini you.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.041
I miss you.

31:04.681 --> 31:05.821
Dom, are you alright?

31:05.921 --> 31:06.901
[Archie] Yeah, the heat refuge

31:07.001 --> 31:08.341
is about to end,
so you should probably leave.

31:08.441 --> 31:09.742
-[Kirsty] Oh, OK. Guys.
-[Francesca] Hey...

31:09.842 --> 31:12.362
-[child] But I don't want to get out.
-I've got to go. I'll call you back.

31:19.363 --> 31:21.384
-[Francesca]<i> What's going on?</i>
-[Kirsty]<i> We should probably go.</i>

31:21.484 --> 31:23.184
-[Francesca]<i> No, don't go.</i>
-[Kirsty]<i> No, no. We should.</i>

31:23.284 --> 31:24.784
But thank you so much for having us.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.945
Maybe you can come back tomorrow,
hang out.

31:27.045 --> 31:29.045
Yeah, I'll see how I go.

31:30.806 --> 31:31.906
[Francesca] What did you say?

31:32.006 --> 31:32.986
Nothing.

31:33.086 --> 31:36.007
Just the heat refuge is ending soon.
I told them that they should leave.

31:37.127 --> 31:39.127
[Archie] What? That's what Dad would
say.

31:47.089 --> 31:53.090
[tense music]

32:28.616 --> 32:29.677
It's funny. The more digging

32:29.777 --> 32:32.777
you do in to someone, the less you feel
like you know them.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.458
Like the picture gets all blurry.

32:38.578 --> 32:40.579
Did you find that when you data mined me?

32:41.219 --> 32:43.239
Those pesky contradictions?

32:43.339 --> 32:45.780
This is your to touche Shay moment, is it?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.700
Nice.

32:50.660 --> 32:51.961
Your father died of Chagas disease

32:52.061 --> 32:54.281
and you used that to get a deal
across the line.

32:54.381 --> 32:56.381
How does that sit with you?

32:57.182 --> 32:59.482
Young woman who joined
International Aid at 18

32:59.582 --> 33:01.582
to try and save the world.

33:05.663 --> 33:06.883
What, you lose focus

33:06.983 --> 33:08.984
somewhere along the way?

33:09.504 --> 33:11.504
You're giving me a lesson on morality?

33:12.544 --> 33:14.545
You chose the money.

33:15.425 --> 33:16.405
Go and...

33:16.505 --> 33:18.726
Go and enjoy your retirement, Shay.

33:18.826 --> 33:21.246
I did a test on the kid

33:21.346 --> 33:23.547
from the resettlement centre.
He's positive.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.587
He's sterile.

33:29.028 --> 33:31.028
Because of you and I.

33:33.668 --> 33:36.109
I'm going to take that to my grave.

33:38.709 --> 33:40.710
What about you?

33:44.070 --> 33:45.371
I want the file

33:45.471 --> 33:48.231
with the other 499 testees.

34:00.633 --> 34:02.634
I have a meeting to get to.

34:12.756 --> 34:14.756
Goodbye, Shay.

34:44.322 --> 34:46.502
[Dom] You should have told me last night
that the situation was that dire.

34:46.602 --> 34:48.102
Maybe I could've done something.

34:48.202 --> 34:51.263
Four people are dead all because
a bloody generator ran out of fuel.

34:51.363 --> 34:53.703
Where is the communication
from aged services, from you guys?

34:53.803 --> 34:55.804
[Carl] You look hot.

34:56.524 --> 34:57.824
Michelle? Could you...

34:57.924 --> 35:00.685
Yeah, could you get Dom
a very cold iced water, please.

35:02.125 --> 35:04.905
Unfortunately, this sort of thing happens
more than you'd like to think.

35:05.005 --> 35:07.666
Infrastructure's just falling apart
all over the place.

35:07.766 --> 35:10.006
You look like you've got the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.567
-I need a favour.
-Mm-hm?

35:14.127 --> 35:15.787
Israel Latu, there's been
some sort of cock-up

35:15.887 --> 35:18.168
with his wife's city residential
application.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.789
I had the Latus' file splashed
across my desk this morning

35:21.889 --> 35:23.949
but there's been cock-up.
They just didn't get enough points.

35:24.049 --> 35:25.549
There's other people in the queue who did.

35:25.649 --> 35:27.970
Yeah, but, you know,
a flick of your pen could sort that out.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.610
What's your stake in all this?

35:32.651 --> 35:34.651
He's been very loyal to us.

35:35.171 --> 35:37.471
There's plenty of Israels out there
who are willing to fill his shoes.

35:37.571 --> 35:39.392
All I'm asking is that you look
at his file again

35:39.492 --> 35:41.492
with a more favourable eye.

35:43.493 --> 35:47.493
You know you only get one dip
into the ministry favour bank, yeah?

35:48.413 --> 35:49.994
I think you've cashed in your chips.

35:50.094 --> 35:52.094
What?

35:53.614 --> 35:55.235
I'm not sure I understand.

35:55.335 --> 35:56.515
[Carl] Come on, mate.

35:56.615 --> 35:58.435
Why do you think I called you in here?

35:58.535 --> 36:00.156
We know what your sister's been up to.

36:00.256 --> 36:02.276
The only reason my guys haven't gone
in there to pick them up

36:02.376 --> 36:05.237
is out of my loyalty to you.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.337
[exhales]

36:08.137 --> 36:09.877
[Carl] Look.

36:09.977 --> 36:11.978
We retrieved this
from the resettlement centre.

36:15.538 --> 36:16.519
[Carl] When border authority

36:16.619 --> 36:18.879
go in, if your sister's at home,

36:18.979 --> 36:20.879
she's going to be arrested and charged.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.680
OK.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.680
Thanks for the heads up.

36:24.780 --> 36:28.041
I understand it's family.
You'd do anything for them.

36:28.141 --> 36:31.141
But you need to tell me
you can sort this out.

36:32.902 --> 36:34.902
Just give me a...

36:37.463 --> 36:39.323
Let me get Eadie out of the house

36:39.423 --> 36:41.683
and then can go in and pick them up.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.784
OK. I can work with that.
You've got two hours.

36:44.664 --> 36:46.664
Drink that.

36:49.425 --> 36:51.425
[knocking]

36:52.545 --> 36:53.766
It's Abel.

36:53.866 --> 36:54.926
[Eadie]<i> Shouldn't you be at work?</i>

36:55.026 --> 36:57.146
Funny thing happened on the way
to the office.

36:58.266 --> 37:01.367
Technically, I'm suspended
pending further investigation.

37:01.467 --> 37:04.248
Oh, Abel. I'm so sorry
for dragging you into this.

37:04.348 --> 37:05.568
[baby crying]

37:05.668 --> 37:06.648
Dragging me?

37:06.748 --> 37:09.468
I handed you the key and the pass,
remember?

37:10.589 --> 37:12.529
But you might've given me
a kick up the bum at some stage

37:12.629 --> 37:13.809
about the remit,

37:13.909 --> 37:17.370
so maybe you get partial credit
for my unemployment status.

37:17.470 --> 37:19.470
[baby crying]
[Rima] Eadie!

37:20.110 --> 37:21.251
He just vomited.

37:21.351 --> 37:23.011
OK, right. He really needs to go
to hospital.

37:23.111 --> 37:24.091
Is that an option?

37:24.191 --> 37:27.332
Not without declaring
your residency status on admission.

37:27.432 --> 37:30.332
Border Authority will be over you guys
in the second.

37:30.432 --> 37:31.413
He's steady now, yeah?

37:31.513 --> 37:32.493
[baby crying]

37:32.593 --> 37:34.593
His temperature
really needs to come down.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.254
If we need to go, I'll make that call.

37:37.354 --> 37:39.894
[baby crying]

37:39.994 --> 37:41.134
[Rima] Shh...

37:41.234 --> 37:43.775
[phone ringing]

37:43.875 --> 37:46.815
[phone ringing]
[baby crying]

37:46.915 --> 37:48.176
[Rima] Shh, baby.

37:48.276 --> 37:50.436
Shh, it's OK.

37:52.276 --> 37:54.277
[phone calling]

37:56.237 --> 37:58.238
[phone ringing]

38:00.838 --> 38:01.818
Hey.

38:01.918 --> 38:04.339
Oh, hey. I didn't know if you'd pick up.

38:04.439 --> 38:07.039
[baby crying]

38:08.559 --> 38:10.260
Baby Sifa. I've done everything I can.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.500
[Eadie]<i> But he needs to go to hospital.</i>

38:11.600 --> 38:12.860
<i>I know.</i>

38:12.960 --> 38:14.621
<i>But then they'll deport him</i>

38:14.721 --> 38:16.741
and I just... I don't know
what the right thing to do is anymore

38:16.841 --> 38:17.821
and I'm scared.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.582
[Eadie]<i> Lloyd, I'm just really scared.</i>

38:19.682 --> 38:21.682
[distant siren]

38:22.202 --> 38:23.542
Baby, it's OK, it's OK.

38:23.642 --> 38:24.943
What you need me to do?

38:25.043 --> 38:27.723
I... I need you. I just need you, Lloyd.

38:31.124 --> 38:34.064
I'm coming. OK? You just hold tight.
I'm coming.

38:34.164 --> 38:35.144
Eadie?

38:35.244 --> 38:37.505
[Lloyd]<i> I'm coming home. Alright?</i>

38:37.605 --> 38:38.945
Thank you.
[distant sirens]

38:39.045 --> 38:41.045
[baby crying]

38:49.047 --> 38:51.807
Come on, Eadie. Come on, Eadie.
Pick up for god's sake.

38:53.448 --> 38:55.448
[Israel] Mr. Boulay?

38:56.368 --> 38:57.469
Yeah, not now, Israel.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.549
[Israel] I'm just wondering whether or not
you'd spoken to the minister.

38:59.649 --> 39:01.189
Wheels in motion.

39:01.289 --> 39:02.910
Wheels in...

39:03.010 --> 39:05.010
[Israel] So, you have spoken to him?

39:09.091 --> 39:11.091
Mr. Boulay?

39:12.971 --> 39:14.972
Mr. Boulay? You OK?

39:15.332 --> 39:17.332
Mr. Boulay?

39:19.053 --> 39:20.993
Dom, can you hear me?

39:21.093 --> 39:23.093
Can I get you anything?

39:25.174 --> 39:27.174
Come on, let's get you up.

39:30.695 --> 39:32.695
[Israel] Dom.

39:35.816 --> 39:37.816
Your family...

39:40.457 --> 39:41.957
We don't have much time.

39:42.057 --> 39:43.157
Come on.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.257
Come on!

39:53.059 --> 39:55.059
-[Carl]<i> How good are the oysters?</i>
-[Karima]<i> Thank you.</i>

39:56.179 --> 39:58.200
[Dom]<i> They're fantastic. You've got</i>
<i>to try them with the... the sauce.</i>

39:58.300 --> 39:59.960
[Dom]<i> Are you going to have any of</i>
<i>these?</i> [Carl]<i> No, no, no.</i>

40:00.060 --> 40:01.520
-[Dom]<i> No?</i>
-[Carl]<i> No, I don't want the sauce.</i>

40:01.620 --> 40:02.961
-[Dom]<i> You've got to have one.</i>

40:03.061 --> 40:04.361
-[Karima]<i> Eugh.</i>
-[Dom]<i> Why not?</i>

40:04.461 --> 40:06.841
-[Dom]<i> You've not got an appetite?</i>
-[Karima]<i> You might lose yours, too,</i>

40:06.941 --> 40:08.402
<i>when you hear</i> <i>what I have to tell you</i>.

40:08.502 --> 40:10.582
<i>The results are in from the vax test.</i>

40:12.302 --> 40:14.303
[Dom]<i> Go on then, hit me with it.</i>

40:16.943 --> 40:18.324
[Eadie] What are you doing here?

40:18.424 --> 40:19.404
You've got to move.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.504
-[Eadie] What?
-You've got to move.

40:23.945 --> 40:26.945
[phone ringing]

40:29.026 --> 40:30.406
[Shay]<i> Lloyd, don't hang up.</i>

40:30.506 --> 40:32.366
<i>Just... Where are you?</i>

40:32.466 --> 40:34.467
I've been out with the traps.
I'm heading home.

40:35.027 --> 40:36.767
[Shay]<i> 75% of the poor bastards</i>

40:36.867 --> 40:38.867
who put their hands up
for the trial vax are now...

40:39.788 --> 40:41.788
...sterile.

40:42.268 --> 40:43.248
What?

40:43.348 --> 40:45.449
[Shay]<i> I got access to their numbers.</i>

40:45.549 --> 40:47.569
-How did you manage to get access--
-[Shay]<i> I said please</i>

40:47.669 --> 40:49.609
really sweetly.

40:49.709 --> 40:51.650
And there's a file,

40:51.750 --> 40:53.410
a recorded lunch meeting.

40:53.510 --> 40:55.410
Karima must've had it up her sleeve.

40:55.510 --> 40:57.451
Some sort of self-protection.

40:57.551 --> 40:58.931
[Lloyd]<i> And who was at this meeting?</i>

40:59.031 --> 41:00.011
[Shay] Karima,

41:00.111 --> 41:01.452
the minister and...

41:01.552 --> 41:03.552
...your brother-in-law.

41:03.872 --> 41:04.892
Come on.

41:04.992 --> 41:07.173
[Shay]<i> It's three out of every four</i>
<i>and they're still going to roll it out.</i>

41:07.273 --> 41:08.493
[baby cries]
[Lloyd] And how do you know?

41:08.593 --> 41:10.853
[Shay]<i> Because Lindriquil's share price</i>
<i>is going gangbusters</i>

41:10.953 --> 41:12.334
<i>and that can only mean one thing.</i>
[door closes]

41:12.434 --> 41:16.094
[Lloyd]<i> And you are certain</i>
<i>about Dom's involvement?</i>

41:16.194 --> 41:18.195
He's in it up to his neck.

41:23.076 --> 41:24.056
[car horn]

41:24.156 --> 41:25.136
[screeching tyres]

41:25.236 --> 41:26.256
[car horn]

41:26.356 --> 41:28.357
[screeching tyres]

41:29.397 --> 41:31.397
Lloyd?

41:31.877 --> 41:33.878
Lloyd?

41:34.318 --> 41:35.298
Lloyd?

41:35.398 --> 41:39.879
[tense music]

41:44.280 --> 41:46.280
[siren]

41:48.760 --> 41:50.761
[Dom] Come on. Get in. Quick as you can.

41:51.521 --> 41:53.521
[police officer] Where are the Latus,
Abel?

41:54.121 --> 41:55.142
Step out of the way.

41:55.242 --> 41:57.242
You need to move off the road now.
