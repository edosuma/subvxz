WEBVTT

00:34.959 --> 00:36.500
SO...

00:37.333 --> 00:39.417
ANYWAY, HERE'S THE THING.

00:39.417 --> 00:42.542
UM, I MESSED UP,

00:42.542 --> 00:45.542
AND I'M REALLY SORRY...

00:47.000 --> 00:50.041
YOU KNOW,
FOR MY INSANE BEHAVIOR

00:50.041 --> 00:51.208
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS,

00:51.208 --> 00:54.375
FOR ANY PAIN OR WORRY I
MIGHT HAVE CAUSED YOU GUYS,

00:54.375 --> 00:56.834
FOR...

00:56.834 --> 01:00.500
PUSHING YOU AWAY
WHEN YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO BE MY FRIENDS.

01:00.500 --> 01:06.166
SO THE THING IS
THAT AFTER THE WHOLE
CHRISTMAS DEBACLE,

01:06.166 --> 01:09.875
YOU KNOW, I WENT HOME
TO LOS ANGELES, AND...

01:09.875 --> 01:12.208
THIS ONE NIGHT,

01:12.208 --> 01:17.250
THIS ONE HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE NIGHT,

01:17.250 --> 01:22.875
I FOUND MYSELF
AT THIS PARTY IN MALIBU

01:22.875 --> 01:25.750
ON THIS BEACH...

01:25.750 --> 01:27.417
FULL OF STRANGERS.

01:27.417 --> 01:31.041
AND THE SUN
WAS COMING UP, AND...

01:31.041 --> 01:33.708
I WAS JUST DRUNK
OFF MY ASS, AND...

01:33.708 --> 01:37.208
I REMEMBER LOOKING AROUND
AND THINKING,

01:37.208 --> 01:40.417
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:40.417 --> 01:42.917
"MAYBE THE PROBLEM
ISN'T JOEY...

01:42.917 --> 01:44.500
"OR PACEY OR...

01:46.208 --> 01:49.250
"JEN OR C.J.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.208
"OR JACK OR DAWSON
OR ANYONE ELSE.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.166
"JUST MAYBE...

01:55.750 --> 01:57.417
MAYBE IT'S ME."

01:59.291 --> 02:02.917
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO FORGIVE ME RIGHT AWAY

02:02.917 --> 02:06.875
BECAUSE I DO REALIZE
HOW BAD I'VE MESSED UP, AND...

02:09.083 --> 02:11.250
YOU KNOW, I JUST...

02:11.250 --> 02:13.458
IF YOU GUYS
WANNA CALL ME SOMETIME,

02:13.458 --> 02:15.792
YOU KNOW, JUST TO SAY HI,
THAT WOULD BE REALLY COOL.

02:15.792 --> 02:19.834
BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE YOU GUYS,
AND I MISS YOU,

02:19.834 --> 02:23.542
AND I'M JUST
REALLY SORRY.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.333
AUDREY.
Jen: AUDREY.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.750
HEY, COME ON.
COME BACK HERE.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.792
AUDREY. AUDREY.
HEY.

02:29.792 --> 02:31.583
WE MISSED YOU.
YEAH.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.291
I MISSED YOU,
SWEETIE.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.625
IT'S OK.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.166
MMM. MMM.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.917
OH, GOD! HA!

03:37.333 --> 03:39.375
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:39.375 --> 03:40.708
I WAS JUST HAVING
A SEXUAL FANTASY

03:40.708 --> 03:42.333
ABOUT
THE NEW BARTENDER.

03:42.333 --> 03:45.542
WE WERE OUT IN THE ALLEY,
AND WE WERE DOING IT

03:45.542 --> 03:47.208
AGAINST THE BRICK WALL
BEHIND THE GARBAGE BINS.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.708
INTERESTING.

03:48.708 --> 03:51.708
'CAUSE TO ME, IT'S
TOTALLY THE POOL TABLE.

03:51.708 --> 03:54.208
JOEY POTTER,
I AM SHOCKED!

03:54.208 --> 03:57.834
WHAT? I AM NOT
ABOVE THE OCCASIONAL
RANDOM SEXUAL FANTASY

03:57.834 --> 04:00.667
TO HELP THE OTHERWISE
GLACIALLY PACED WORKDAY.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.708
BELIEVE ME. DON'T LET
THE PRIM EXTERIOR
FOOL YOU.

04:03.708 --> 04:07.417
UNDERNEATH IT ALL,
I'M ACTUALLY...

04:07.417 --> 04:08.542
LESS PRIM.

04:08.542 --> 04:10.750
(LAUGHS) OH, WHILE
WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT

04:10.750 --> 04:13.917
OF BARTENDERS
WITH LUST-WORTHY ASSES,

04:13.917 --> 04:15.166
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO EDDIE?

04:15.166 --> 04:17.208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
HE GOT FIRED.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.250
WELL, I KNOW THAT.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.708
BUT HE NEVER EVEN CAME BACK
TO CLEAR OUT HIS LOCKER.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.959
WELL, WHY WOULD
YOU THINK

04:22.959 --> 04:24.250
THAT I WOULD KNOW
WHERE HE WAS?

04:24.250 --> 04:26.417
WELL, WEREN'T YOU TWO--

04:26.417 --> 04:29.750
OH. OH, WE HAD
A LITTLE FLING.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.417
A BARELY SIGNIFICANT
FLING.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.125
I MEAN, IT WAS...

04:33.125 --> 04:34.208
NOTHING.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.917
I GUESS I MUST
HAVE GOT IT WRONG.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.959
YEAH. ME AND EDDIE,
WAY OVER.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.583
IT WAS OVER
BEFORE IT STARTED.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.083
OK, WELL, GOOD.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.083
THEN I GUESS YOU WOULDN'T MIND
CLEARING OUT HIS LOCKER.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.750
THE BOSS HAS BEEN
ASKING ME ABOUT IT,

04:47.750 --> 04:48.959
AND WE REALLY DO
NEED THE SPACE.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.125
I'D DO IT MYSELF,
BUT I WAS KINDA HOPING

04:51.125 --> 04:52.792
TO CUT OUT EARLY
FOR BAND PRACTICE.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.417
YEAH, SURE.
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

04:55.417 --> 04:56.417
GOOD. OK.

04:56.417 --> 04:57.291
UM, I GUESS
YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH

04:57.291 --> 04:58.458
JUST THROW EVERYTHING
INTO THE GARBAGE.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.917
IF THERE WAS
ANYTHING OF ANY WORTH,

04:59.917 --> 05:01.959
I'M SURE HE WOULD HAVE
COME BACK FOR IT ALREADY.

05:01.959 --> 05:03.625
RIGHT.

05:03.625 --> 05:04.875
YOU'RE A LOVE.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.875
OH. HAVE FUN THEN, JOEY.

05:14.542 --> 05:17.083
SO CONTINUE WATCHING TO SEE
IF THE MERGER TAKES.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.625
IN THE MEANTIME, ADVISE
CAUTION TO YOUR CLIENTS.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.625
NOW ONE FINAL NOTE.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.959
I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU

05:22.959 --> 05:24.625
TO KEEP PUSHING
STEPATECH INDUSTRIES.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.041
IT'S ABOUT TO SHOOT
THROUGH THE ROOF.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.750
WHEN THEIR NEW DRUG
GETS APPROVED ON MONDAY,

05:27.750 --> 05:29.000
ANYONE WHO HOLDS THE STOCK

05:29.000 --> 05:31.041
IS GOING
TO BE VERY, VERY RICH.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.250
AND I DON'T NEED
TO REMIND YOU

05:32.250 --> 05:34.000
THAT STEPATECH ITSELF
IS A CLIENT HERE,

05:34.000 --> 05:35.834
AND WE'D LIKE
TO KEEP THEM HAPPY,

05:35.834 --> 05:37.166
SO KEEP GIVING IT
THE HARD SELL.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.458
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO OUT THERE
AND MAKE SOME MONEY.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.959
WITTER, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR ONE SECOND?

05:48.458 --> 05:49.125
PLEASE.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.125
HERE'S THE THING.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.250
I KNOW WE'VE HAD OUR
PROBLEMS IN THE PAST,

05:54.250 --> 05:55.792
BUT DON'T THINK
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT

05:55.792 --> 05:58.375
I'D LET YOUR GOOD WORK
GO UNNOTICED OR UNREWARDED.

05:58.375 --> 05:59.417
RICH, PLEASE,

05:59.417 --> 06:01.125
THE ENORMOUS COMMISSIONS
ARE REWARD ENOUGH FOR ME.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.333
SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE ACOLYTE.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.667
SO I HAVE AN EXTRA
REWARD IN STORE FOR YOU.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.333
THERE'S A BIG SHINDIG
TOMORROW NIGHT

06:08.333 --> 06:09.166
AT THE HOME
OF ROGER STEPAVITCH.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.542
DO YOU KNOW WHO
ROGER STEPAVITCH IS?

06:10.542 --> 06:12.125
OF COURSE I DO.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.458
HE'S THE FOUNDER AND CEO
OF STEPATECH INDUSTRIES.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.000
VERY GOOD.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.708
HE ASKED ME PERSONALLY
TO BRING

06:16.708 --> 06:19.208
MY MOST PROMISING SELLER
TO THIS PARTICULAR SHINDIG,

06:19.208 --> 06:20.708
WHICH PUTS ME
IN KIND OF A TOUGH POSITION

06:20.708 --> 06:24.041
BECAUSE, WELL, IT'S YOU,
PACEY.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.667
YOU'RE MY BEST SELLER.
LET'S FACE IT.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.542
YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF
NATURAL GIFT FOR THIS STUFF,

06:27.542 --> 06:29.375
A GIFT WHICH UNFORTUNATELY
IS MATCHED

06:29.375 --> 06:31.500
ONLY BY YOUR INCREDIBLE EGO
AND ATTITUDE.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.000
AND I'M TORN
BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND,

06:34.000 --> 06:35.208
I SEE FLASHES
OF GREATNESS IN YOU.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.041
AND ON THE OTHER HAND,

06:36.041 --> 06:38.333
I SEE FLASHES OF YOU
FREAKING OUT ON ME

06:38.333 --> 06:40.041
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRENCH
QUARTER DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS,

06:40.041 --> 06:41.875
OR YOU SUDDENLY
PRETENDING TO GET SICK

06:41.875 --> 06:43.166
AND BLOWING OFF WORK
FOR A COUPLE DAYS

06:43.166 --> 06:44.708
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.792
SO AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M IN A BIT OF A BIND.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.000
I WANT TO BRING YOU
TO THIS PARTY, PACEY.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.834
BUT FIRST I NEED
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.250
CAN YOU BE A TEAM PLAYER?

06:55.250 --> 06:57.542
WOW, RICH, I--
I MEAN, UH, HEH.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.750
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY HERE.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.917
I'M HONORED.
YEAH.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.750
I'M HONORED BY THE TRUST
THAT YOU'VE PLACED IN ME,

07:02.750 --> 07:04.125
AND I DO KNOW
THAT WE HAVE HAD

07:04.125 --> 07:05.125
OUR DIFFERENCES
IN THE PAST.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.959
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT NOW

07:06.959 --> 07:09.583
I AM 100% COMMITTED
TO THIS JOB

07:09.583 --> 07:10.792
AND EVERYTHING
THAT IT HAS TO OFFER.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.417
AND I FULLY REALIZE

07:12.417 --> 07:13.959
WHAT AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY
YOU'RE GIVING ME HERE

07:13.959 --> 07:15.375
BY TAKING ME
TO THIS PARTY, SO--

07:15.375 --> 07:17.083
WITTER, I DON'T NEED
YOUR LIFE STORY.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.708
A SIMPLE YES OR NO
WOULD HAVE SUFFICED.

07:18.708 --> 07:19.959
RIGHT. WELL,
IN THAT CASE,

07:19.959 --> 07:21.792
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.750
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME 100%.
I'M A TEAM PLAYER.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.542
GOOD. IT'S SETTLED, THEN.
YOU'RE COMING TO THE PARTY.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.834
I--I APPRECIATE THAT.
THAT'S--THIS IS FANTASTIC.

07:36.542 --> 07:37.208
HI.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.625
SORRY TO KEEP YOU
ALL WAITING. I--

07:46.625 --> 07:49.333
OH. HELLO.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.583
DUDE, WHAT IS UP WITH ALL
THE COURTNEY LOVE WANNABES?

07:51.583 --> 07:53.166
IT'S LIKE AN AUDREY
CONVENTION OUT THERE.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.583
UM, YES, WELL,
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON IN

07:55.583 --> 07:57.417
AND I'LL EXPLAIN
ABOUT THAT.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.500
(SIGHS) HEY.

08:07.834 --> 08:10.291
OK, YOU GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

08:10.291 --> 08:11.959
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE SOMEBODY DIED?

08:11.959 --> 08:13.917
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS.

08:13.917 --> 08:16.583
UM, THOSE GIRLS OUT THERE?

08:16.583 --> 08:19.959
THEY'RE OUT THERE
BECAUSE THEY'RE AUDITIONING

08:19.959 --> 08:22.250
TO BE LEAD SINGER
OF THIS BAND.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.458
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE
A LEAD SINGER, YOU GUYS.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.208
YES, WE DID
HAVE A LEAD SINGER.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.208
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE FLAKED OUT
SO TERRIBLY,

08:28.208 --> 08:29.625
SHE HAD
TO BE REPLACED.

08:29.625 --> 08:30.625
YOU KNOW,
GOT DRUNK A LOT,

08:30.625 --> 08:32.166
MESSED UP ON STAGE,

08:32.166 --> 08:33.833
AND THEN DISAPPEARED
TO CALIFORNIA

08:33.833 --> 08:35.332
WITHOUT SO MUCH
AS A PHONE CALL,

08:35.332 --> 08:37.041
MISSING SEVERAL
BAND REHEARSALS,

08:37.041 --> 08:38.542
YOU KNOW,
THE USUAL BIT

08:38.542 --> 08:40.082
THAT GETS
LEAD SINGERS
KICKED OUT OF BANDS.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.291
BUT THE THING IS
WE HAVE A GIG
TOMORROW NIGHT,

08:43.291 --> 08:44.458
LIKE, A REAL GIG.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.542
WELL, WE'RE THIRD
ON THE BILL,

08:45.542 --> 08:47.208
BUT WE'RE OPENING UP
FOR A BAND

08:47.208 --> 08:49.333
THAT'S OPENING UP
FOR A BAND
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.333
LIKE, AMAZING, ACTUALLY,

08:50.333 --> 08:51.625
AND...

08:51.625 --> 08:53.166
THIS COULD POTENTIALLY
BE HUGE FOR US,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.625
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO MUCK IT UP.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.792
WHAT BAND?

08:55.792 --> 08:57.000
LOUD MILK.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
OH.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.625
I LOVE THAT BAND.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.667
DON'T WE ALL,

09:01.667 --> 09:03.542
AND WE'RE PLAYING
AT THE BENT ELBOW.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.166
THE PLACE
IS, LIKE, FAMOUS.

09:05.166 --> 09:06.333
I KNOW.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.708
IT'S ALL
FAIRLY MONUMENTAL,

09:07.708 --> 09:10.708
WHICH IS
WHY WE NEEDED
A NEW LEAD SINGER,

09:10.708 --> 09:12.625
ONE WITH THE TALENT

09:12.625 --> 09:14.291
MINUS THE DRAMA.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.083
OK.

09:18.083 --> 09:21.708
I GOT IT, BUT...

09:21.708 --> 09:24.375
THE THING IS...

09:24.375 --> 09:25.834
THAT YOU GUYS
SHOULD KNOW,

09:25.834 --> 09:28.041
IS THAT THERE WAS
THIS LEAD SINGER,

09:28.041 --> 09:29.834
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
WHO FLAKED OUT TERRIBLY

09:29.834 --> 09:31.917
AND MESSED UP AND
DESERVED TO GET FIRED,

09:31.917 --> 09:34.750
BUT, YOU SEE, THAT
LEAD SINGER--SHE'S GONE.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.375
BECAUSE SHE HAD
THIS MOMENT OF CLARITY
ON A BEACH IN MALIBU,

09:37.375 --> 09:39.542
AND SHE REALIZED
THAT ALL OF THE DRINKING

09:39.542 --> 09:41.542
AND THE PARTYING
AND--AND THE GENERAL MAYHEM

09:41.542 --> 09:42.708
WAS COSTING HER THE THINGS

09:42.708 --> 09:43.875
THAT WERE MOST IMPORTANT
IN HER LIFE

09:43.875 --> 09:45.458
LIKE HER FRIENDS AND...

09:45.458 --> 09:46.917
THIS BAND.

09:46.917 --> 09:47.917
YOU GUYS, I'M SORRY.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.625
I'M REALLY SORRY

09:49.625 --> 09:51.125
BECAUSE THIS BAND
IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS

09:51.125 --> 09:53.959
THAT I CARE ABOUT
IN THE WHOLE STUPID WORLD!

09:53.959 --> 09:56.375
OK, AND--AND
YOU HAVE GOT TO ADMIT

09:56.375 --> 09:59.417
THAT I MAY BE
PART OF THE REASON

09:59.417 --> 10:01.208
WHY YOU GUYS
GOT THAT GIG.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.625
AND YOU KNOW THAT NONE
OF THOSE GIRLS OUT THERE

10:03.625 --> 10:05.083
ARE GONNA BE
HALF AS GOOD AS ME

10:05.083 --> 10:06.458
WHEN I'M GOOD!

10:06.458 --> 10:07.875
AND I PROMISE YOU

10:07.875 --> 10:09.208
THAT IF YOU GIVE ME
ANOTHER CHANCE,

10:09.208 --> 10:10.041
I WILL BE BETTER THAN GOOD.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.708
I WILL BE THE BEST.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.083
PLEASE.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.792
YOU GUYS, JUST GIMME--

10:14.792 --> 10:16.208
JUST GIMME
ANOTHER CHANCE, PLEASE?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.458
OK.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.041
BUT I SWEAR, IF YOU
MAKE ME REGRET THIS,

10:29.041 --> 10:30.291
I WILL KILL YOU.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.083
NO, I WON'T,
I WON'T, I WON'T!

10:31.083 --> 10:32.000

MEET BACK HERE AT 8:15?

12:39.417 --> 12:40.375
OK.
SURE.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.083
HEY.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.417
HELLO.

12:49.417 --> 12:51.583
YOU GIRLS ROCK.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.125
OH. WELL, THANKS.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.750
SO, UM...

12:55.750 --> 12:57.291
UH, YOU LIKE
TO HAVE FUN?

12:57.291 --> 12:59.583
I GUESS.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.208
WELL, I'M WITH THE, UH,
THE OTHER OPENING BAND,

13:01.208 --> 13:02.417
SATAN'S TAMPON?

13:02.417 --> 13:03.417
YOU EVER HEAR OF US?

13:03.417 --> 13:05.875
(LAUGHS) I CAN'T
SAY THAT I HAVE.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.208
RIGHT.
WELL, THERE'S A--

13:07.208 --> 13:08.750
THERE'S A PARTY HAPPENIN'
LATER ON THE TOUR BUS

13:08.750 --> 13:09.542
IF YOU WANNA COME.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.083
OK, HARLEY,

13:14.083 --> 13:15.125
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FOLLOW THE FORMULA.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.333
IT'S SIMPLE.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.125
"A" SQUARED
PLUS "B" SQUARED

13:17.125 --> 13:18.583
EQUALS "C" SQUARED.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.000
(SCOFFS) FORGET IT.
I'M NEVER GONNA GET IT.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.083
YES, YOU WILL.
YOU JUST FOLLOW
THE FORMULA.

13:22.083 --> 13:22.917
SCREW THE FORMULA.

13:22.917 --> 13:25.333
THE FORMULA CAN LICK
MY LILY-WHITE ASS.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.834
NICE. YOU KISS YOUR FATHER
WITH THAT MOUTH?

13:27.834 --> 13:30.500
EW, GROSS. WHY WOULD
I KISS MY FATHER?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.750
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A BREAK?

13:32.750 --> 13:34.125
YOU WANT A SODA?

13:34.125 --> 13:35.417
I'D RATHER
HAVE A VODKA.

13:35.417 --> 13:37.125
OH, SORRY.
WE'RE OUT.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.458
WHAT?

13:41.458 --> 13:43.125
JUST WONDERIN'
HOW YOU'RE HOLDIN' UP.

13:43.125 --> 13:46.125
HOW I'M HOLDING UP?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.750
LOOK, WE COULD
SIT HERE ALL NIGHT

13:47.750 --> 13:50.083
AND PRETEND THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT YOU AND EDDIE

13:50.083 --> 13:52.125
OR YOU COULD
ACTUALLY REALIZE

13:52.125 --> 13:53.792
THAT I MIGHT
BE A GOOD CONFIDANTE
OR SHOULDER TO CRY ON.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.500
WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.291
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
BUT THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE'S
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT?

13:59.834 --> 14:01.834
THE BOY JUST DISAPPEARED
WITH NO EXPLANATION.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.375
HE BROKE YOUR HEART.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.417
YOU'RE DYING INSIDE,
WANTING TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

14:05.417 --> 14:07.166
THANKS FOR THE RECAP.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.125
JOEY, LISTEN,

14:09.125 --> 14:11.625
I MAY BE A 15-YEAR-OLD
IDIOT, BUT...

14:11.625 --> 14:13.166
I'M ALSO YOUR FRIEND,

14:13.166 --> 14:15.667
AND I UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION
WITH YOU AND EDDIE

14:15.667 --> 14:17.166
BETTER THAN YOU'RE
GIVING ME CREDIT FOR.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.708
YOU'RE MY FRIEND?

14:18.708 --> 14:20.333
YEAH. WE'RE FRIENDS.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.333
AREN'T WE?

14:21.333 --> 14:23.834
YEAH,
I GUESS WE ARE.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.000
COOL. SO,
HOW'S THE SEARCH GOING?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.166
ANY NEW LEADS?

14:27.166 --> 14:28.667
WHAT SEARCH?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.500
WHAT, AM I SUPPOSED
TO HIRE A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

14:30.500 --> 14:32.291
TO FIND SOME GUY
I DATED FOR 2 MONTHS

14:32.291 --> 14:34.500
WHO OBVIOUSLY NEVER
WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN?

14:34.500 --> 14:35.834
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO SEE YOU?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.375
MAYBE HE JUST
GOT BONKED ON THE HEAD

14:37.375 --> 14:38.792
AND NOW HE HAS AMNESIA.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.041
OR MAYBE
HE GOT KIDNAPPED

14:40.041 --> 14:41.750
BY INTERNATIONAL
JEWEL THIEVES.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.041
POINT IS, YOU HAVE TO
BE YOUR OWN DETECTIVE.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.625
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT,

14:45.625 --> 14:46.583
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M TELLING YOU THIS,

14:46.583 --> 14:47.417
BUT...

14:47.417 --> 14:50.792
I SORT OF FOUND
A MANUSCRIPT HE WROTE.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.041
IT HAD A PHONE NUMBER

14:52.041 --> 14:53.041
AND ADDRESS ON IT
IN WORCESTER,

14:53.041 --> 14:53.875
WHICH IS WHERE
HIS PARENTS LIVE,

14:53.875 --> 14:55.041
AND THEY PROBABLY
KNOW WHERE HE IS--

14:55.041 --> 14:56.375
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

14:56.375 --> 14:58.208
WHAT, AM I JUST SUPPOSED
TO CALL THEM UP AND ASK?

14:58.208 --> 14:59.333
YES! DUH.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.708
DON'T YOU THINK IT--

15:00.708 --> 15:02.542
IT SEEMS A LITTLE
DESPERATE AND PATHETIC?

15:02.542 --> 15:04.125
IT'S ROMANTIC
AND HEARTFELT.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.834
I GUESS IT WOULDN'T
HURT TO CALL.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.500
I MEAN, AT LEAST
I'D KNOW WHERE HE WAS.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.542
YOU KNOW,
THAT HE WAS ALIVE.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.083
GO. CALL.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.667
(DIALING)

15:20.125 --> 15:21.417
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:21.417 --> 15:22.417
OH, IT'S
ALL VERY EXCITING.

15:22.417 --> 15:23.250
THE PHONE
IS ACTUALLY RINGING.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.750
(LAUGHS)
SHUT UP.

15:26.917 --> 15:27.708
HELLO?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.959
WELCOME TO THE BIG
LEAGUES, MY FRIEND.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.708
PLEASE
DON'T EMBARRASS ME.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.500
RICH RINALDI.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.959
HI.

16:02.959 --> 16:03.959
Man: HEY. HOW YA DOING?
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YA.

16:03.959 --> 16:04.875
Rich: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.959
SO, CONGRATULATIONS
ON LANDING THE ACCOUNT.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.625
ROGER'S OVER THERE
SINGING YOUR PRAISES.

16:08.625 --> 16:09.792
THAT'S CERTAINLY
APPRECIATED, CARL.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.125
WE DO OUR BEST.

16:11.125 --> 16:11.959
THIS IS,
UH, CARL ROSEN,

16:11.959 --> 16:14.458
VP IN CHARGE OF MARKETING
AT STEPATECH.

16:14.458 --> 16:17.333
HAVE YOU MET PACEY WITTER,
ONE OF OUR MOST PROMISING
YOUNG SELLERS?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.959
I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE
GONNA BE HEARING A LOT
FROM HIM IN THE FUTURE.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.250
OH, PLEASURE TO MEET
YOU, MR. WITTER.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.417
IT'S A PLEASURE TO
MEET YOU, TOO, SIR.

16:22.417 --> 16:24.792
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
ENJOY YOURSELVES.

16:24.792 --> 16:27.083
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.083
AH.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.542
EXCUSE ME.

16:29.542 --> 16:32.500
UH, I SEE SOMEONE
THAT I'M GOING NEED
TO POW-WOW WITH.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.792
YOU GONNA
BE OK ON YOUR OWN
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

16:34.792 --> 16:35.917
(CHUCKLES)

16:37.500 --> 16:39.291
(SIGHS)

16:46.083 --> 16:48.250
OK. SAVE ME.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.500
I'M SORRY?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
OK, THERE'S THIS
98-YEAR-OLD MAN
OVER THERE

16:51.500 --> 16:53.458
THAT WILL NOT STOP
GRABBING MY ASS.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.333
SO, YOU KNOW, JUST
UNTIL HE STOPS LURKING,

16:55.333 --> 16:57.250
JUST PRETEND
THAT WE'RE HAVING SOME
SORT OF A CONVERSATION.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.375
OK. (LAUGHS) HI.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.166
THAT'S IT?

17:02.166 --> 17:04.375
THAT'S IT? THAT'S
ALL I GET? "OK. HI"?

17:04.375 --> 17:06.625
OK. HI,
I'M PACEY WITTER.

17:06.625 --> 17:10.791
OH. WELL, SO,
YOU'RE PACEY WITTER.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.165
WHAT,
YOU'VE HEARD OF ME?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.500
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.500
NOW, I'VE HEARD THAT YOU
ARE QUITE THE UP-AND-COMING
YOUNG TALENT,

17:17.500 --> 17:18.791
A REAL BOY WONDER.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.290
AND JUST WHERE
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.666
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
I MAKE IT MY BUSINESS

17:22.666 --> 17:24.040
TO KNOW THESE THINGS.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.458
SO, THEN, YOU WORK
FOR STEPATECH?

17:25.458 --> 17:26.416
NOPE.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.165
SO...

17:28.165 --> 17:29.291
IT MUST BE A REAL HONOR,

17:29.291 --> 17:31.583
RICH PICKING YOU
OUT OF EVERYBODY
TO COME HERE TONIGHT?

17:31.583 --> 17:33.250
I SEE.
YOU KNOW RICH.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.208
WELL,
WHATEVER YOU DO,

17:34.208 --> 17:35.667
DO NOT BELIEVE
A WORD THAT MAN
SAYS ABOUT ME.

17:35.667 --> 17:36.875
SO, TELL ME
SOMETHING, PACEY.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.375
YOU'RE NEW
AT THIS, RIGHT?

17:38.375 --> 17:39.375
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.083
TOUGH BUSINESS.
LOTTA SHARKS.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.333
AH, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.667
WHY THIS?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.500
SMART KID LIKE YOU,
YOU COULD BE IN COLLEGE.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.417
I MEAN, IS IT
THE MONEY OR--

17:47.417 --> 17:49.500
NO. NO. NOT REALLY.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.041
WELL, THAT'S A LIE.

17:51.041 --> 17:52.417
IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS
DEFINITELY THE MONEY,

17:52.417 --> 17:53.625
AND THEN AFTER THAT,

17:53.625 --> 17:54.917
IT WAS
THE THRILL OF THE HUNT,

17:54.917 --> 17:56.333
THE ADRENALINE,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.041
AND NOW I GUESS
IT'S SOME COMBINATION
OF THE BOTH.

17:58.041 --> 17:59.083
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

17:59.083 --> 18:00.083
OOH.

18:00.083 --> 18:01.875
I GUESS HE'S GONE.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.542
WAIT, THAT'S IT?

18:03.542 --> 18:04.333
YOU'RE
JUST GONNA LEAVE?

18:04.333 --> 18:05.750
MM-HMM.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.375
BUT I DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

18:07.375 --> 18:11.041
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER
THAN THAT.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.667
I'LL SEE YA LATER,
PACEY.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.750
WHERE IS SHE?

18:28.750 --> 18:30.083
WHO?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.625
WHO?
WHO, SHE SAYS.

18:31.625 --> 18:32.542
YOU KNOW
DAMN WELL WHO!

18:32.542 --> 18:34.291
HARLEY?

18:34.291 --> 18:35.875
HARLEY, GET YOUR BUTT
OUT HERE THIS INSTANT!

18:35.875 --> 18:37.083
HARLEY ISN'T HERE.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.750
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COVER FOR HER, JOEY.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.083
THE SCHOOL CALLED.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.959
SHE CUT CLASS AGAIN.
FOURTH TIME THIS MONTH.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.834
HARLEY?

18:43.834 --> 18:45.041
COME ON, I KNOW
YOU'RE HIDING.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.834
DON'T BE AFRAID,
JUST GET YOUR ASS
OUT HERE

18:46.834 --> 18:48.834
SO THAT I CAN KICK IT
INTO OBLIVION.

18:48.834 --> 18:49.792
YOU KNOW,
I HATE TO INTERRUPT

18:49.792 --> 18:51.792
YOUR EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE
PARENTING TECHNIQUES,

18:51.792 --> 18:53.959
BUT I'M AFRAID
SHE'S REALLY NOT HERE.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.000
WELL, WHERE DO YOU
THINK SHE WENT?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.125
I MEAN, SHE--SHE'S
PROBABLY OK, RIGHT?

18:57.125 --> 18:59.458
I MEAN, I MEAN
YOU--YOU THINK
SHE'S OK, DON'T YOU?

18:59.458 --> 19:00.959
WHERE IS THIS
COMING FROM?

19:00.959 --> 19:02.500
LOOK, JOEY, I--I ADMIT

19:02.500 --> 19:05.333
THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE MOST PRESENT PARENT
TO THIS POINT,

19:05.333 --> 19:06.917
BUT SOMETIME--

19:06.917 --> 19:08.625
I DON'T KNOW,
ONE MINUTE IT WAS ALL

19:08.625 --> 19:10.291
BARNEY AND ELMO,
AND NOW,

19:10.291 --> 19:12.667
WELL, I'M KINDA
STARTIN' TO REALIZE

19:12.667 --> 19:14.125
THAT MY LITTLE MUFFIN

19:14.125 --> 19:15.500
MIGHT JUST BE
A JUVENILE DELINQUENT.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.917
ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.959
SHE'S NOT
A JUVENILE DELINQUENT.

19:18.959 --> 19:20.625
I MEAN, YEAH,
SHE TALKS A GOOD GAME,

19:20.625 --> 19:22.583
AND SHE MAY SKIP SCHOOL
OCCASIONALLY, BUT...

19:22.583 --> 19:23.917
IT'S ALL JUST A FRONT.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.333
TRUST ME.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.583
STILL DOESN'T
CHANGE THE FACT
THAT SHE'S MISSING.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.542
MY LITTLE GIRL
IS MISSING.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.208
HEY, DADDY.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.333
HARLEY.

19:36.542 --> 19:37.834
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOUNG LADY?

19:37.834 --> 19:39.750
I JUST HAD
AN ERRAND TO RUN...

19:39.750 --> 19:40.959
IN WORCESTER.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.917
HEY.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.708
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

20:05.166 --> 20:06.333
BIG GIG, HUH?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.333
YEAH.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.417
YOU NERVOUS?

20:09.417 --> 20:12.417
NO.

20:12.417 --> 20:15.041
THAT'S A LIE.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.875
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
TREMENDOUSLY.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.041
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
DONE THIS SOBER BEFORE.

20:20.041 --> 20:23.208
WELL,
IN THAT CASE--

20:23.208 --> 20:25.375
I QUIT.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.834
QUIT?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.208
I'M RE-ASSESSING
MY LIFE

20:28.208 --> 20:30.208
OR SOMETHING.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.250
BUMMER.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.208
YEAH.

20:37.333 --> 20:40.208
Man: YEAH, WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO THAT GIRL
IN PHILLY?

20:40.208 --> 20:41.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:41.875 --> 20:43.417
ACTUALLY, CAN I JUST...

20:43.417 --> 20:44.458
HAVE A SIP?

20:44.458 --> 20:46.375
YEAH. SURE.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.125
THANKS.

20:53.542 --> 20:54.834
WANT ONE OF THESE?

20:58.375 --> 20:59.291
OK.

21:03.375 --> 21:04.917
UGH.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.458
THERE YOU GO.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.834
SO DO YOU THINK
MAYBE YOU COULD
STOP IGNORING ME

21:12.834 --> 21:14.083
SO WE COULD GO
SOMEWHERE AND TALK?

21:14.083 --> 21:15.417
OH, I'M SORRY.
WAS I IGNORING YOU?

21:19.083 --> 21:20.917
MY COMPLIMENTS
TO THE CHEF

21:20.917 --> 21:22.041
ON THE DEEP-FRIED
BUFFALO WINGS.

21:22.041 --> 21:22.834
THEY'RE EXCELLENT
TONIGHT.

21:22.834 --> 21:24.917
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
HOME PUNISHING HER?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.208
I AM PUNISHING HER.

21:26.208 --> 21:27.250
I'M MAKING HER SIT

21:27.250 --> 21:28.708
AND HAVE A MEAL
WITH HER FATHER.

21:28.708 --> 21:29.417
BY THE WAY,
WE'RE OUTTA ROOT BEER.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.083
ASK THE BARTENDER.

21:32.083 --> 21:32.917
HEY.

21:34.917 --> 21:37.291
THANK YOU
FOR DRIVING HER BACK,

21:37.291 --> 21:38.792
BUT DO ME A FAVOR.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.417
THE NEXT TIME MY DAUGHTER
COMES TO VISIT YOU
IN THE GUTTER,

21:40.417 --> 21:42.792
SHUT THE DOOR, SLITHER OFF,
AND STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM HER.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.959
SO, THAT'S IT?

21:51.959 --> 21:54.125
YOU'RE JUST NOT
GONNA TALK TO ME?

21:54.125 --> 21:55.291
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY, GO AHEAD.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.125
FINE.

21:57.125 --> 22:00.959
LOOK, JOEY, I'M--I'M
HERE BECAUSE I KNOW,

22:00.959 --> 22:02.417
AND I WANNA HELP YOU
DEAL WITH THIS.

22:02.417 --> 22:03.583
I MEAN, IT'S
MY PROBLEM, TOO.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.792
WHAT?

22:04.792 --> 22:06.458
LOOK,
HARLEY TOLD ME.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.458
OK? I KNOW.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.458
KNOW WHAT?

22:08.458 --> 22:10.500
ABOUT...

22:10.500 --> 22:11.500
ABOUT THE WHOLE,
YOU KNOW,

22:11.500 --> 22:13.667
THE WHOLE
PREGNANCY THING.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.125
OH. YOU MEAN THE WHOLE
FAKE PREGNANCY THING

22:18.125 --> 22:19.834
SHE MADE UP IN ORDER
TO LURE YOU HERE

22:19.834 --> 22:21.333
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.708
THAT WHOLE
PREGNANCY THING.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.250
SO, WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.667
YOU'RE NOT--

22:27.667 --> 22:28.959
YOU MEAN YOU'RE--
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT?

22:28.959 --> 22:29.959
NO.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.333
OH, THANK GOD.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.625
EVEN IF I WAS,
I CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T TELL HARLEY.

22:36.291 --> 22:38.667
HEY, IS THIS MY, UH--

22:38.667 --> 22:40.500
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

22:40.500 --> 22:42.625
JUST ONE OF THE MANY
NON-VALUABLES

22:42.625 --> 22:44.166
YOU LEFT BEHIND
FOR SOMEONE ELSE
TO CLEAN UP.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.667
OH, I SEE.
SO I LEAVE YOU BEHIND,

22:45.667 --> 22:46.875
THEREFORE YOU SEND
YOUR LITTLE MINION
TO COME AFTER ME

22:46.875 --> 22:48.500
AND TRICK ME BACK?

22:48.500 --> 22:49.667
BUT PERHAPS IF
YOU DIDN'T WANNA
BE FOUND, EDDIE,

22:49.667 --> 22:51.333
MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
COVERED YOUR TRACKS
A LITTLE BETTER.

22:51.333 --> 22:54.166
DID YOU--

22:54.166 --> 22:56.375
DID YOU CALL MY HOUSE
AND HANG UP YESTERDAY?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.708
NO.

22:57.708 --> 22:59.542
WOW, YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE.

22:59.542 --> 23:02.583
I MEAN, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
PISSED OFF BY THE WAY
THINGS ENDED BETWEEN US.

23:02.583 --> 23:03.750
OH, YOU SEE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.667
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG

23:05.667 --> 23:08.250
BECAUSE THINGS ACTUALLY
REALLY NEVER ENDED
BETWEEN US, EDDIE.

23:08.250 --> 23:10.792
YOU JUST UP
AND MOVED TO WORCESTER
FOR NO APPARENT REASON

23:10.792 --> 23:12.208
WITHOUT
EVEN INFORMING ME,

23:12.208 --> 23:14.083
WHICH TO ME,
IF YOU ASK ME,

23:14.083 --> 23:15.542
THAT'S NOT REALLY
AN ENDING, NOW, IS IT?

23:15.542 --> 23:17.500
I DON'T CARE.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.667
I MEAN, NOW THAT
I KNOW YOU'RE ALIVE,
THE MYSTERY'S SOLVED.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.041
YOU CAN GO.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.708
JOEY, I LEFT, BUT
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK

23:21.708 --> 23:23.375
THAT MAYBE
I DID THAT FOR YOU?

23:23.375 --> 23:24.834
ARE YOU DYING, EDDIE?

23:24.834 --> 23:26.166
NO.

23:26.166 --> 23:27.750
WERE YOU PROTECTING,
UH, GOVERNMENT SECRETS?

23:27.750 --> 23:30.417
WERE YOU KIDNAPPED
BY INTERNATIONAL JEWEL
THIEVES? IS THAT IT?

23:30.417 --> 23:32.041
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,

23:32.041 --> 23:34.041
THE ONLY PERSON
YOU DID THAT FOR
WAS YOURSELF.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.041
IT WAS A NICE,
EASY OUT.
I GET IT.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.834
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU GOT IT.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.083
YOU'RE OUT.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.250
DO YOU THINK
IT WAS THAT EASY?

23:41.250 --> 23:42.917
IT WAS THE HARDEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

23:42.917 --> 23:44.166
REALLY?

23:46.375 --> 23:48.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT, OK?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.083
I'M JUST GONNA GO.

23:49.083 --> 23:50.417
FINE.
FINE.

23:50.417 --> 23:52.125
FINE!

24:01.375 --> 24:03.458
SO, WHY,
EDDIE? WHY?

24:03.458 --> 24:04.959
BECAUSE, OK?

24:04.959 --> 24:06.875
BECAUSE?
BECAUSE.

24:06.875 --> 24:09.250
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
EVEN FACE YOU.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.875
OK? BECAUSE
I WAS ASHAMED.

24:10.875 --> 24:12.250
ASHAMED?
ASHAMED OF WHAT?

24:12.250 --> 24:15.750
ASHAMED OF WHAT?
JOEY, I COULDN'T
EVEN FIND A JOB.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.792
I COULDN'T PAY RENT.
THEY TURNED
MY ELECTRICITY OFF.

24:17.792 --> 24:19.917
I HAD COCKROACHES
CRAWLING ON MY ARM.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.333
BUT WHY
WOULD YOU THINK

24:21.333 --> 24:23.125
THAT WOULD
MAKE A DIFFERENCE
TO ME, EDDIE?

24:23.125 --> 24:26.083
I MEAN, I'M POOR,
TOO, REMEMBER?
I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

24:26.083 --> 24:28.417
NO, OK? YOU ARE
NOT JUST LIKE ME,

24:28.417 --> 24:29.625
'CAUSE YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE A FUTURE.

24:29.625 --> 24:30.792
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
A LIFE AHEAD OF YOU.

24:30.792 --> 24:31.792
SO DO YOU.

24:31.792 --> 24:34.667
NO! NO,
DON'T YOU SEE?

24:34.667 --> 24:37.291
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
I PUNCHED HETSON THAT TIME,

24:37.291 --> 24:39.917
BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT,
AND I KNEW HE WAS RIGHT.

24:39.917 --> 24:42.625
I MEAN, WHY IS IT
THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN'T SEE IT?

24:42.625 --> 24:45.125
JOEY, I'M NOTHING.

24:45.125 --> 24:47.250
I'M JUST A GUY
WITH NO JOB,

24:47.250 --> 24:49.083
NO MONEY IN THE BANK,
NO PROSPECTS,

24:49.083 --> 24:52.625
NO EDUCATION,
NO TALENTS, NOTHING.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.625
HELL, I EVEN GOT
THE REJECTION LETTER
TO PROVE IT.

24:54.625 --> 24:55.917
THEY SAID
YOU HAVE PROMISE.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.166
WELL, THEY SAY THAT
TO EVERYONE THEY REJECT.

24:57.166 --> 24:59.500
YEAH, BUT IN YOUR CASE,
IT'S TRUE.

24:59.500 --> 25:03.667
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
THE PEP TALK AND ALL, I DO.

25:03.667 --> 25:06.834
BUT LET'S FACE FACTS.

25:06.834 --> 25:09.875
I MEAN, YOU AND I,
WE'RE HEADED FOR
2 VERY DIFFERENT FUTURES.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.500
AND THE TRUTH IS,
JOEY, IS...

25:13.500 --> 25:16.000
YOU DESERVE TO BE WITH
THE BEST GUY IN THE ROOM,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.333
NOT THE ONE
WHO PICKS UP HIS TRASH

25:19.333 --> 25:23.000
OR BUSES HIS TABLE.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.166
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT
IN THIS LIFE, JOEY.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.250
I WANTED YOU.

25:31.166 --> 25:33.542
NO.

25:33.542 --> 25:37.834
NO, YOU WANTED THAT GUY
YOU MET IN ENGLISH CLASS.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.250
AND I'M NOT HIM.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.917
I GOTTA GO.

26:09.917 --> 26:12.792
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

26:31.041 --> 26:35.208
WHAT IS UP,
BENT ELBOW?!

26:41.625 --> 26:43.417
WELL, I GOT IN
ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

26:43.417 --> 26:45.250
SORT OF HAD
AN INSTINCT ABOUT IT.

26:45.250 --> 26:47.083
INSTINCT OR LUCK?

26:47.083 --> 26:48.875
I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK
WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.250
Man: THE LUCKY ONES
NEVER DO.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.917
COME ON, WE HAVE
SOME BUSINESS
TO ATTEND TO.

26:56.917 --> 26:58.375
DO YOU KNOW HER?

26:58.375 --> 27:00.083
WHO?
HER.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.917
UH, WELL,
FROM THE BACK
OF HER HEAD,

27:01.917 --> 27:04.375
I'D SAY I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA.

27:04.375 --> 27:06.208
NOW, PERHAPS, YOU'D
LIKE TO JOIN ME

27:06.208 --> 27:07.917
IN THE
PRIVATE OFFICE
OF ROGER STEPAVITCH

27:07.917 --> 27:09.959
SO WE CAN DISCUSS
WAYS YOU AND I
CAN GET CLOSER

27:09.959 --> 27:11.000
TO BECOMING
MILLIONAIRES.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.792
I CAN DO THAT.
GOOD.

27:17.625 --> 27:19.959
SO, PACEY,

27:19.959 --> 27:23.291
RICH TELLS ME YOU HAVE
QUITE A RAW TALENT.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.291
WELL, EVERYTHING I LEARNED,
I LEARNED FROM RICH.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.917
WELL, I APPRECIATE
ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

27:27.917 --> 27:29.917
YOU'VE HELPED
SELL A LOT OF
STEPATECH STOCK FOR US.

27:29.917 --> 27:31.750
ONLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN YOUR COMPANY, SIR.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.792
TELL ME, PACEY,
WERE YOU SURPRISED

27:33.792 --> 27:36.125
WHEN RICH TOLD YOU
THAT WE DECIDED

27:36.125 --> 27:38.125
YOU SHOULD TAKE ON
A MORE PROMINENT ROLE

27:38.125 --> 27:39.583
IN THE HANDLING
OF THE STEPATECH
CORPORATE ACCOUNT?

27:42.250 --> 27:44.667
ACTUALLY, ROGER,
I HADN'T MENTIONED IT
TO HIM YET.

27:44.667 --> 27:46.125
OH.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.667
AND I'M REALLY SORRY,
GENTLEMEN,

27:47.667 --> 27:49.333
BUT I DON'T THINK
I FOLLOW.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A MORE PROMINENT ROLE?

27:50.667 --> 27:53.333
UH, IT'S LIKE
A PROMOTION, PACEY.

27:53.333 --> 27:54.667
YOUR TITLE
WILL STAY THE SAME,

27:54.667 --> 27:56.875
BUT YOU WILL BE GETTING
A SUBSTANTIAL RAISE.

27:56.875 --> 27:59.542
AND FROM NOW ON,
YOUR NAME WILL BE
ON ALL TRANSACTIONS

27:59.542 --> 28:01.417
THAT WE HANDLE
FOR STEPATECH CORPORATE.

28:03.708 --> 28:07.333
THAT'S--
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.792
BUT HONESTLY, DO YOU
THINK I'M READY FOR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

28:09.792 --> 28:11.166
I MEAN, I JUST
FINISHED THOSE
SERIES 7s,

28:11.166 --> 28:14.000
AND I'M
A LITTLE GREEN,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

28:14.000 --> 28:14.834
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
THINK I CAN DO IT--

28:14.834 --> 28:17.667
UH, I THOUGHT
THAT YOU SAID THAT, UM--

28:17.667 --> 28:20.875
ACTUALLY,
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED
BY YOUR ATTITUDE, PACEY.

28:20.875 --> 28:23.000
I'M SORRY.
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I THINK I MIS-SPOKE.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.166
IT'S JUST
SUCH A FANTASTIC
OPPORTUNITY

28:25.166 --> 28:26.500
FOR A MAN
AS YOUNG AS MYSELF.

28:26.500 --> 28:27.875
IT CAUGHT ME A
LITTLE FLAT-FOOTED.

28:27.875 --> 28:30.333
BUT LET IT
NEVER BE SAID
THAT PACEY J. WITTER

28:30.333 --> 28:31.875
IS NOT
ALL ABOUT STEPPING
INTO THE FUTURE,

28:31.875 --> 28:33.250
WHICH,
IF I'M CORRECT,

28:33.250 --> 28:34.875
IS ACTUALLY
THE SLOGAN FOR
YOUR FINE COMPANY.

28:34.875 --> 28:36.333
THAT'LL DO.

28:36.333 --> 28:39.708
EXCELLENT. WELL,
WELCOME ABOARD,
YOUNG MAN.

28:39.708 --> 28:41.834
I PREDICT GREAT THINGS
FOR YOU IN THE FUTURE.

28:41.834 --> 28:42.792
WELL, THANK YOU, SIR.

28:42.792 --> 28:44.375
AND I HOPE I CAN LIVE
UP TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.333
I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT YOU WILL.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.041
YOU'RE MAD AT ME,
AREN'T YOU?

28:59.041 --> 29:01.375
NO.

29:01.375 --> 29:02.834
YES, YOU ARE.

29:02.834 --> 29:04.667
I KNOW I MESSED UP.
I'M SORRY.

29:04.667 --> 29:07.834
YOU WERE SO SAD, I
JUST THOUGHT I COULD HELP.

29:07.834 --> 29:09.417
I KNOW, HARLEY.

29:09.417 --> 29:12.125
IT'S JUST THAT
IN THE FUTURE,

29:12.125 --> 29:14.542
MAYBE YOU COULD
OBTAIN MY EXPRESS
WRITTEN CONSENT

29:14.542 --> 29:16.542
BEFORE YOU GO OFF
WILLY-NILLY TELLING BOYS
THAT I'M PREGNANT,

29:16.542 --> 29:19.083
OR ON SECOND THOUGHT,

29:19.083 --> 29:20.417
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
NOT DO IT AT ALL, OK?

29:20.417 --> 29:22.041
I WON'T. PROMISE.

29:22.041 --> 29:23.417
THANKS.

29:23.417 --> 29:24.542
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

29:27.250 --> 29:29.625
HE'S GONE.

29:29.625 --> 29:33.583
HE JUST LEFT,
AND HE'S GIVEN UP,

29:33.583 --> 29:34.750
AND THE THING
THAT SUCKS ABOUT IT

29:34.750 --> 29:35.917
IS I READ THOSE STORIES,

29:35.917 --> 29:37.542
AND THEY'RE
ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD,

29:37.542 --> 29:39.542
AND HE'S NEVER GONNA
DO ANYTHING WITH THEM.

29:39.542 --> 29:42.083
HE'S PROBABLY JUST GONNA
ROT AWAY IN WORCESTER
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

29:42.083 --> 29:43.250
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I CAN DO.

29:43.250 --> 29:46.708
LOOK.

29:46.708 --> 29:47.792
WHAT?

29:47.792 --> 29:48.750
HELLO?

29:48.750 --> 29:50.583
NO.

29:50.583 --> 29:51.750
WHY NOT?

29:51.750 --> 29:52.959
BECAUSE I'M...

29:52.959 --> 29:55.750
I'M NOT
ASKING YOUR DAD
TO READ HIS STORIES.

29:55.750 --> 29:56.750
I MEAN,
HE'D NEVER HELP HIM,

29:56.750 --> 29:57.750
AND EVEN
IF HE WANTED TO,

29:57.750 --> 29:58.750
EDDIE WOULD
NEVER LET HIM.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.000
IT'S WORTH A TRY,
ISN'T IT?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.291
I MEAN,
IF MY DAD HATES THEM,

30:01.291 --> 30:02.542
EDDIE NEVER HAS TO KNOW,

30:02.542 --> 30:04.917
AND IF HE LOVES THEM,
MAYBE HE CAN HELP HIM.

30:04.917 --> 30:07.375
IT'S BETTER
THAN HIM ROTTING AWAY
IN WORCESTER FOREVER.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.792
PROFESSOR HETSON,

30:18.792 --> 30:21.125
UM...

30:21.125 --> 30:24.000
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU COULD MAYBE READ
THESE SHORT STORIES

30:24.000 --> 30:26.959
AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK.

30:26.959 --> 30:30.750
YOU ARE AWARE THAT
I'M HONEST TO A POINT
SOME HAVE CALLED BRUTAL?

30:30.750 --> 30:31.667
YES.

30:31.667 --> 30:32.667
AND THAT I'VE CRUSHED
MORE THAN ONE WOULD-BE

30:32.667 --> 30:35.834
SYLVIA PLATH'S LITERARY
AMBITIONS INTO OBLIVION?

30:35.834 --> 30:38.500
YOU'RE STILL WILLING
TO TAKE THAT CHANCE
WITH YOURS?

30:38.500 --> 30:40.250
THEY'RE NOT
REALLY MY AMBITIONS.

30:41.834 --> 30:43.000
NO.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.333
COME ON.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.375
YOU JUST
HAVE TO READ THEM.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.500
I MEAN,
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

30:46.500 --> 30:47.708
THEY'RE AMAZING,
ACTUALLY.

30:47.708 --> 30:48.875
I DON'T CARE.

30:48.875 --> 30:50.500
YOU'RE
HIS LAST CHANCE,
PROFESSOR HETSON.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.041
I KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE CONNECTIONS.

30:52.041 --> 30:54.125
IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE
HIM SOME ENCOURAGEMENT,
AT LEAST?

30:54.125 --> 30:56.291
LOOK, MISS POTTER,
LET'S GET SOMETHING CLEAR.

30:56.291 --> 30:58.708
NOT ONLY IS YOUR MR. DOLING
NOT A REGISTERED STUDENT
AT WORTHINGTON,

30:58.708 --> 31:01.333
NOT ONLY DID HE TRY TO DEFRAUD
OUR HALLOWED UNIVERSITY,

31:01.333 --> 31:03.500
OK, NOT ONLY DID HE KIDNAP
MY ONE AND ONLY--

31:03.500 --> 31:04.625
HE DIDN'T KIDNAP HER.

31:04.625 --> 31:05.834
HE GAVE HER A RIDE HOME.

31:05.834 --> 31:06.750
POTATO, PO-TAH-TO.

31:06.750 --> 31:10.000
THE THING IS, JOEY,
I COULD FORGIVE ALL THAT

31:10.000 --> 31:11.625
IF IT WERE NOT
FOR ONE FATAL MISTAKE.

31:11.625 --> 31:13.250
HE PUNCHED ME IN THE FACE.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.333
I MEAN, THERE COULD
HAVE BEEN SCARRING,
BROKEN BONES.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.166
WE'RE TALKING
SERIOUS DISFIGUREMENT

31:16.166 --> 31:18.542
OF ONE OF MY MOST
CHERISHED ASSETS,

31:18.542 --> 31:21.208
AND THAT IS NOT COOL
IN MY BOOK.

31:21.208 --> 31:22.333
COME ON, HARLEY.
WE GOTTA GO.

31:26.208 --> 31:27.250
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL WORK ON HIM.

31:28.875 --> 31:29.959

34:30.375 --> 34:32.792
HARLEY "FORGOT"
HER BACKPACK.

34:32.792 --> 34:34.000
OH, YEAH, UM,
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.375
IT'S RIGHT
BEHIND THE BAR.

34:35.375 --> 34:39.875
SO YOUR LITTLE PLAN
WORKED.

34:39.875 --> 34:43.041
HARLEY ANNOYED ME
INTO READING A COUPLE
OF MR. DOLING'S STORIES.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.917
REALLY?

34:44.917 --> 34:46.583
YES.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.208
AND WHILE I FOUND THEM
TO BE OVERALL PERHAPS

34:49.208 --> 34:51.750
MAYBE A LITTLE OVERWROUGHT
AND DERIVATIVE,

34:51.750 --> 34:54.750
THEY DO SHOW AT THEIR CORE
A WRITER WITH POTENTIAL.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.417
REALLY? YOU THINK
HE HAS POTENTIAL?

34:56.417 --> 34:57.750
DON'T MAKE ME
SAY IT AGAIN.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.083
WELL, I MEAN,
IS THERE SOMETHING--

34:59.083 --> 35:01.041
THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING YOU
CAN DO TO HELP HIM.

35:01.041 --> 35:03.583
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU
CAN SHOW HIS STORIES
TO A PUBLISHER.

35:03.583 --> 35:05.250
HE'S NOT READY FOR THAT.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.417
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD
PULL SOME STRINGS
AT WORTHINGTON.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.083
NO.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.250
COME ON, THERE'S
GOTTA BE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO,

35:09.250 --> 35:10.291
ANYTHING.

35:10.291 --> 35:12.750
ALL RIGHT.
THERE IS SOMEONE I KNOW

35:12.750 --> 35:14.750
WHO TEACHES AT THE
CALIFORNIA WRITER'S WORKSHOP.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.166
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET HIM IN?

35:16.166 --> 35:17.583
I THINK EDDIE
COULD GET EDDIE IN

35:17.583 --> 35:18.917
WITH MY RECOMMENDATION.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.708
WELL, ISN'T THAT PLACE

35:20.708 --> 35:22.750
KIND OF,
LIKE, PRESTIGIOUS?

35:22.750 --> 35:24.083
KINDA, LIKE, UH-HUH.

35:24.083 --> 35:26.083
WELL, HE
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
AN UNDERGRAD DEGREE.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.542
YEAH, NO, I KNOW.
I STILL THINK
HE'S GOT A SHOT.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.417
LET ME KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS.

35:29.417 --> 35:31.083
OH, YEAH,
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,

35:31.083 --> 35:31.917
ACTUALLY,
PROFESSOR HETSON,

35:31.917 --> 35:33.792
I THINK HE'D RATHER
HEAR IT FROM YOU.

35:33.792 --> 35:34.834
JOEY,
THE KID PUNCHED ME.

35:34.834 --> 35:36.333
I'LL TRY AND GET HIM
INTO THIS PROGRAM,

35:36.333 --> 35:37.750
BUT I KINDA THINK
THAT THAT'S ENOUGH.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.291
YEAH, BUT, SEE,
PROFESSOR HETSON,

35:39.291 --> 35:41.959
THE THING IS,
HE'S KIND OF...
GIVEN UP,

35:41.959 --> 35:44.000
AND I DON'T THINK
HE'D LISTEN TO ME.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.792
I REALLY...

35:45.792 --> 35:47.125
WE'RE NOT ON
THE BEST OF TERMS.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.458
IT'S A FASCINATING SAGA.

35:48.458 --> 35:49.583
TELL YOU WHAT.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

35:49.583 --> 35:50.417
YOU WANT TO TRY
AND CONVINCE HIM,

35:50.417 --> 35:51.625
TELL HIM I'LL WRITE
A RECOMMENDATION,

35:51.625 --> 35:52.625
BUT EITHER WAY,
IT'S UP TO YOU.

35:52.625 --> 35:53.959
THE BALL'S
IN YOUR COURT, KID.

35:53.959 --> 35:54.792
LOOK, I'M OFF.

35:54.792 --> 35:57.959
I'VE GOT HARLEY
CHAINED TO A RADIATOR.

35:57.959 --> 36:00.458
KIDDING, JOEY.
GET A SENSE OF HUMOR.

36:10.542 --> 36:13.708
SO, I GUESS THIS
IS GOOD NIGHT.

36:13.708 --> 36:15.750
YOU KNOW, I'M NEVER GOING
TO BE ABLE TO CALL YOU

36:15.750 --> 36:16.667
IF YOU DON'T
TELL ME YOUR NAME.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.792
THAT WAS A BIG NIGHT
FOR YOU IN THERE, HUH?

36:18.792 --> 36:20.166
YEAH, I GUESS IT WAS.

36:20.166 --> 36:21.375
YEAH.

36:21.375 --> 36:23.542
SO, UM,
I SAW YOU AND RICH

36:23.542 --> 36:25.667
GOING INTO ROGER'S
PRIVATE OFFICE.

36:25.667 --> 36:27.125
I'M SORRY?

36:27.125 --> 36:28.166
LET ME GUESS.

36:28.166 --> 36:30.834
YOU'RE MOVING UP
IN THE WORLD,

36:30.834 --> 36:32.542
MAYBE HE OFFERED YOU
A PROMOTION?

36:32.542 --> 36:34.166
A BIG RAISE?

36:34.166 --> 36:35.166
ARE YOU A REPORTER?

36:35.166 --> 36:38.792
LOOK, I JUST THINK
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
ASK YOURSELF

36:38.792 --> 36:42.166
WHY THIS HAS
ALL BEEN SO EASY...

36:44.166 --> 36:45.959
OR IF
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.792
GOOD LUCK, PACEY.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.834
(GASPS)

38:29.792 --> 38:31.000
HEY.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.375
HEY.

38:34.417 --> 38:35.959
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

38:35.959 --> 38:39.875
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS.

38:39.875 --> 38:41.166
IT DOESN'T BELONG
IN THE GARBAGE.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.458
THANKS.

38:45.458 --> 38:46.375
SURE.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.792
I GAVE IT
TO HETSON, AND, UH,

38:49.792 --> 38:51.291
HE SAID HE COULD MAYBE

38:51.291 --> 38:52.792
GET YOU INTO THE
CALIFORNIA WRITER'S WORKSHOP.

38:52.792 --> 38:56.333
YOU, UH, GAVE
THIS TO HETSON?

38:56.333 --> 38:58.667
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

38:58.667 --> 39:00.667
WHAT'S THE POINT,
JOEY?

39:00.667 --> 39:02.000
I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LET ME IN.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
EVEN IF THEY DID,
I CAN'T AFFORD
THAT PLACE.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
MAYBE THERE'S
A SCHOLARSHIP, OK?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.625
OR FINANCIAL AID.

39:07.625 --> 39:10.000
THE POINT IS
TO AT LEAST TRY.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.500
I MEAN, THIS IS A SHOT,
EDDIE, A REAL SHOT.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.792
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE IT.

39:16.834 --> 39:18.959
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IF YOU WANT TO BE A COWARD
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP

39:18.959 --> 39:20.959
AND RUN OUT ON ME,
THAT'S FINE,

39:20.959 --> 39:22.625
BUT DON'T BE
A COWARD ABOUT THIS.

39:22.625 --> 39:24.291
I MEAN, THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

39:24.291 --> 39:26.041
DON'T GIVE UP SO EASILY.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.041
I GUESS I SHOULD GO.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:36.000 --> 39:36.917
ACTUALLY,
I'M NOT GONNA GO

39:36.917 --> 39:38.875
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

39:38.875 --> 39:39.959
LOOK, A LONG TIME AGO,

39:39.959 --> 39:42.250
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WANTED
TO BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

39:42.250 --> 39:44.583
THAT TOOK CHANCES,
WHO REALLY LIVED LIFE,

39:44.583 --> 39:46.166
BUT I GUESS
THAT WAS A LINE, HUH?

39:46.166 --> 39:49.375
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID

39:49.375 --> 39:52.500
OF ME, OF YOURSELF,
OF ACTUALLY LIVING YOUR LIFE.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.208
YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.875
SO NOW WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

39:59.875 --> 40:02.583
ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT HERE
AND ROT AWAY IN WORCESTER?

40:11.000 --> 40:11.917
NO.

40:13.875 --> 40:16.083
WRONG ANSWER.

40:16.083 --> 40:18.708
I'M JUST DOING
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.417
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

40:21.417 --> 40:23.083
(SIGHS)

40:23.083 --> 40:24.417
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT, EDDIE.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.542
I...

40:26.542 --> 40:27.583
I GOTTA GO.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.041
WAIT, JOEY, WAIT.

40:29.041 --> 40:31.250
(SIGHS)

40:31.250 --> 40:34.083
I LOVE YOU.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.834
PLEASE, JOEY,
DON'T--DON'T GO.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.000
I DON'T WANT IT
TO BE TOO LATE.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.333
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.000
BYE.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.125
AUDREY.

41:36.125 --> 41:37.458
AUDREY.

41:37.458 --> 41:39.083
AUDREY, WAKE UP.

41:39.083 --> 41:40.125
AUDREY!

41:40.125 --> 41:42.041
AUDREY.
