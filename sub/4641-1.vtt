WEBVTT

01:02.988 --> 01:05.699
It might not be any of my business,

01:06.283 --> 01:10.621
but JC's crew's headed this way
to bump you, and they all got shanks.

01:11.872 --> 01:12.998
I know.

01:14.249 --> 01:17.086
- Go, get out.
- Be good, homie.

01:22.591 --> 01:25.094
- Out of my road, nigga!
- Yeah.

01:25.469 --> 01:29.348
See this motherfucker right here?
This motherfucker think he special.

01:29.431 --> 01:31.475
- Wanna be left alone and shit.
- Fucking yeah.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.852
Don't wanna be mobbed out
with the rest of us niggas,

01:33.936 --> 01:37.147
like we ain't shit.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:37.856 --> 01:41.026
Shit don't work like that around here,
homeboy.

01:41.568 --> 01:45.239
Yeah, you going with the pack,
you the pack bitch.

01:45.990 --> 01:47.157
Feel me?

01:49.034 --> 01:50.744
He kind of tight, too.

01:51.036 --> 01:53.580
That shit don't mean nothing
round here though, player.

01:53.664 --> 01:55.124
I've seen a whole lot of built motherfuckers

01:55.165 --> 01:58.127
get their ass bent over up in here every day.

01:58.168 --> 02:00.337
You understand what I'm telling you?

02:01.839 --> 02:04.008
I'm talking to you, partner.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.473
You got to the count of five.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.436
- This motherfucker talking to me?
- One.

02:16.145 --> 02:18.188
You hear this motherfucker?

02:18.981 --> 02:20.983
Two.

02:21.066 --> 02:24.236
- You hear this motherfucker?
- Three.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.531
You just signed
your own death certificate, player.

02:28.699 --> 02:30.284
Goddamn.

02:47.926 --> 02:49.595
Shit.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.188
I need you to deliver a message.

02:59.813 --> 03:03.275
I want you to tell every motherfucker
behind these walls

03:03.359 --> 03:06.195
that if they get the notion to fuck with me,

03:06.987 --> 03:07.946
don't.

03:37.893 --> 03:40.854
Man, you know it's hotter
than a motherfucker out here.

03:40.938 --> 03:43.816
Then tell your mother to stick her fat ass
out the window and give us some shade.

03:43.899 --> 03:45.818
Fuck you, nigga.

03:45.901 --> 03:47.528
- Shit, here she comes.
- Hey!

03:47.569 --> 03:48.654
Hi.

03:48.988 --> 03:50.906
Are you tweaking? You all right?

03:50.990 --> 03:51.991
Y'all holding?

03:52.074 --> 03:54.868
- Yeah, what you think?
- Yeah, baby. You got some Swiss?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.371
- Count this shit.
- Let me count that. Let me count that.

03:57.413 --> 03:58.414
- Make sure she does.
- Good?

03:58.497 --> 04:01.166
All crinkled up and shit.
Yeah, give it to her.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.292
Hey!

04:05.337 --> 04:08.799
You all get off my block before I call
the police on your asses again.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.011
Fuck you,
you old Fred Sanford-looking ass.

04:12.094 --> 04:14.388
Yeah, yo. Take your ass back to TV Land,

04:14.471 --> 04:17.349
you Nick-at-Nite-looking motherfucker.
Peace, homie.

04:31.697 --> 04:32.990
Checkmate.

04:33.699 --> 04:37.119
See, I told you I'm always thinking
three moves ahead.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.788
Thanks, baby.

04:39.830 --> 04:42.333
You know, this thinking generates heat.

04:58.682 --> 05:00.976
Thank Jesus for the shade.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.981
You looking for a room, mister?

05:06.357 --> 05:07.316
Yeah.

05:08.359 --> 05:09.943
Yeah, come on.

05:13.989 --> 05:17.868
Hey, Tamara, there's a fellow here
looking for a room.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.831
Jared, it's time for dinner, baby.

05:29.338 --> 05:30.839
Can I help you?

05:31.006 --> 05:33.175
Sign says "Room for rent. "

05:39.181 --> 05:41.642
It may need a little airing out.

05:44.269 --> 05:45.646
This is just fine.

05:46.271 --> 05:49.191
You know, since I keep kids, I have rules.

05:50.359 --> 05:54.029
No gangsters, no guns, no loud music

05:55.322 --> 05:57.950
and no women in or out.

05:59.034 --> 06:02.538
So this may not be the type of place
that you're looking for.

06:03.247 --> 06:07.626
This seems like
just the kind of place I'm looking for.

06:09.795 --> 06:11.588
So what's your name?

06:15.718 --> 06:17.011
Call me Bone.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.180
Well, Mr. Bone...

06:23.058 --> 06:24.351
Ante up.

06:38.324 --> 06:44.204
I'm not taking a chance on you, am I,
Mr. Bone?

06:45.789 --> 06:46.790
No.

06:55.507 --> 06:56.508
Bone.

07:49.019 --> 07:50.562
Come on, big fella.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.439
Yeah, baby.

07:57.319 --> 07:59.488
Yeah, bust his fucking ass.

08:12.001 --> 08:13.585
Dicks on the wall!

08:15.462 --> 08:19.425
And the winner, coming straight from
the New York City penal system,

08:19.508 --> 08:21.969
the homicidal homosexual,

08:22.052 --> 08:23.721
the savage faggot,

08:23.804 --> 08:26.015
the queer that inspires fear,

08:26.098 --> 08:28.309
the butt-battling bandit,

08:28.600 --> 08:31.437
Mommie Dearest!

08:33.313 --> 08:35.024
Dicks on the walls, baby!

08:59.131 --> 09:00.966
Here we go. You up next.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.427
Hey, this is serious. This ain't no joke.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.721
I'm ready.

09:17.066 --> 09:19.652
Let's get this show on the road.

09:20.653 --> 09:22.154
Yo. What up?

09:26.950 --> 09:28.452
We got three to one.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.973
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:49.056 --> 09:50.474
niggas and bitches,

09:50.557 --> 09:53.519
next up we got the man from
the Lone Star State,

09:53.602 --> 09:56.730
the raging redneck, half man, half steer,

09:56.814 --> 09:59.066
a shotgun and a bottle of beer, bitch.

09:59.149 --> 10:02.903
This motherfucker,
this motherfucker right here's so raw,

10:02.945 --> 10:06.031
he eats steaks directly off live bulls' asses.

10:06.115 --> 10:09.284
I'm talking about the killer from
Dallas' grassy knoll.

10:09.368 --> 10:13.747
Giddy-up, y'all, for the Cowboy!

10:15.624 --> 10:17.334
Nigga better be on tonight,

10:17.418 --> 10:19.878
'cause he's going up against
the baddest of the bad.

10:20.254 --> 10:24.466
Oh, yeah. I know you all know
what I'm talking about, right? Right?

10:24.591 --> 10:27.386
I'm talking about the unholy combination

10:27.428 --> 10:30.139
- from the Zulu nation.
- We got three to one.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.890
Yeah, three to one.

10:32.516 --> 10:35.436
You got 10 G on Hammer? All right.

10:35.894 --> 10:38.480
We're in the pipe, baby. Five by five.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.401
The Hammerman!

10:45.362 --> 10:47.740
Okay, cuz, here we go.
I know he's a big motherfucker.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.784
That is a big motherfucker,
but you are faster, man.

10:50.826 --> 10:52.411
You're way faster.
All you gotta do is stick and move,

10:52.494 --> 10:54.455
stick and move, bob and weave,
like I told you.

10:54.538 --> 10:55.622
Are you ready?

10:56.623 --> 10:58.250
Get him. Kill him.

10:58.417 --> 11:00.377
I ain't scared of him.

11:01.712 --> 11:03.547
Dumbass motherfucker.

11:05.758 --> 11:08.260
Knuckle up!

11:34.411 --> 11:38.207
Hammer, it's over! Hammer, it's over!

11:38.248 --> 11:41.627
It's over! Hammer, enough. It's over!

11:42.878 --> 11:44.171
It's over.

11:46.382 --> 11:49.259
And the winner, once again,

11:50.678 --> 11:52.096
the Hammerman.

12:00.145 --> 12:01.689
What can I say?

12:02.314 --> 12:05.609
You've still got
one of the hardest hitters in the streets.

12:05.693 --> 12:07.111
Tell me about it.

12:08.612 --> 12:10.614
Well, ain't you gonna count it?

12:10.656 --> 12:12.574
I trust you, Pinball.

12:15.411 --> 12:17.579
Do I have a reason not to?

12:17.663 --> 12:18.622
No.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.332
Good.

12:26.797 --> 12:27.798
Fuck.

12:38.309 --> 12:39.310
Don't.

12:39.852 --> 12:42.313
What the fuck you want?
What you want? My rims?

12:42.396 --> 12:44.565
No, I don't want your rims.

12:44.648 --> 12:46.567
Well, then, what the fuck?

12:47.026 --> 12:49.320
I wanna fight with Hammerman.

12:49.403 --> 12:51.613
Oh, yeah, and I wanna fuck Beyonce.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.575
Looks like you need a new fighter.

12:55.993 --> 12:57.828
So, you a fighter.

12:58.162 --> 12:59.163
Yeah, you know what?

12:59.204 --> 13:01.999
I could sling fifty cents of nickels
outside this car and hit ten fighters,

13:02.082 --> 13:03.625
ain't one that can fuck with Hammerman.

13:03.709 --> 13:05.711
What the fuck's so special about you?

13:05.794 --> 13:08.339
Set me up a fight and I'll show you.

13:09.048 --> 13:12.384
Well, first of all, it's gonna cost
at least 20 large to set up a fight.

13:12.468 --> 13:14.803
Second, Hammer don't fuck with no scrubs.

13:14.845 --> 13:16.680
You ain't got no name,
you ain't got nothing.

13:16.722 --> 13:18.265
Who the fuck you think you are?

13:18.349 --> 13:20.059
And third, you think
I'm gonna put up my own money

13:20.142 --> 13:21.310
for a fighter I ain't never seen fight?

13:21.393 --> 13:24.563
Shit, you must be smoking that
new kind of crack.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.484
$260.

13:29.068 --> 13:31.153
Get me a fight with anyone.

13:31.737 --> 13:34.239
- What's in it for me?
-20%.

13:34.573 --> 13:36.867
Use your own money, you get 40.

13:43.248 --> 13:44.333
Yeah.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.710
James, Franklin here.

13:46.794 --> 13:50.756
I'd like you to pay
our old friend Darryl a visit tonight.

13:52.216 --> 13:53.384
Okay.

13:54.426 --> 13:58.097
- I'll handle it.
- By the way, nice suit

14:17.282 --> 14:18.325
You out of here, James?

14:18.409 --> 14:21.245
Yeah, a few things to take care of.
You know how it is.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.338
You're looking kind of hard there,
ain't you, family?

14:32.673 --> 14:34.216
Hard not to.

14:35.926 --> 14:37.011
Yeah.

14:39.972 --> 14:41.223
Angela.

15:02.453 --> 15:05.956
James, you ain't met my new fighter
yet, huh? This is...

15:06.040 --> 15:08.459
What the fuck they call you, anyway?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.836
- Bone.
- Bone. Bone.

15:11.295 --> 15:13.881
I call him Bone because
that's what he breaking when he hits.

15:13.964 --> 15:16.091
In your ass, little Asian Liberace.

15:31.774 --> 15:32.775
Teddy.

15:33.651 --> 15:35.194
Boys, let's break it up.

15:37.613 --> 15:39.406
Let me give you a piece of advice.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.450
You'd just as soon
glue mouse ears to your balls

15:41.492 --> 15:43.243
and dangle them
in front of an angry alley cat

15:43.327 --> 15:44.953
than fuck with that girl.

15:46.330 --> 15:47.706
What?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.459
Don't you ever do that again.

15:51.085 --> 15:53.837
- What?
- Don't pretend like you don't know.

15:54.129 --> 15:55.297
What?

15:57.841 --> 15:59.969
Say "what" one more time.

16:01.095 --> 16:04.056
Say "what" one more time
like you don't know.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.353
What the fuck do you mean?

16:11.146 --> 16:13.357
James, where we going?

16:18.112 --> 16:19.279
Darryl's.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.826
You all wanna go to Darryl's?

16:25.244 --> 16:27.079
I hear Shelly's cooking.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.668
Take her home.

16:33.919 --> 16:36.797
Let's roll, let's roll.
Come on, Angela, let's go.

16:51.645 --> 16:53.689
Man, I got $260. I got $260.
Give me ten to one.

16:53.772 --> 16:55.232
- No, baby, no, baby. Five to one.
- Come on.

16:55.316 --> 16:57.609
- Five to one.
- Huh? You killing me, D.

16:57.693 --> 17:00.195
That's the best odds you're gonna get
for a scrub.

17:00.279 --> 17:03.490
All right then. Let's do this.
Five to one, and that suit.

17:03.574 --> 17:05.992
Hey, yo, gather round.
Gather round, everybody.

17:06.035 --> 17:07.536
We got one more matchup tonight.

17:07.618 --> 17:10.164
Gather round
because there's a new kid in town.

17:10.204 --> 17:13.041
Y'all didn't know,
he was sent to serve somebody.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.883
Yo, Big L, you ready?

17:21.675 --> 17:24.094
Big L, whoop his ass!

17:25.804 --> 17:28.557
Yeah, baby, break a bone, baby.
Break a bone.

17:28.641 --> 17:29.850
All right, then.

17:30.726 --> 17:32.353
Knuckle up!

17:53.666 --> 17:56.877
Yo, Deke,
give me that motherfucking money...

18:00.965 --> 18:02.883
We gonna make some money.
You and me, baby.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.969
You and me, partner. No doubt.

18:05.052 --> 18:08.180
I'm fucking getting this shit all together.
We're gonna start outside of town, right?

18:08.263 --> 18:10.641
A few little fights, here and there.
You just gonna whoop some ass.

18:10.724 --> 18:12.977
We're gonna stack our Swiss up just enough

18:13.060 --> 18:15.104
that these greedy motherfuckers
around here don't know what's up.

18:15.187 --> 18:16.355
Then we go straight for James.

18:16.438 --> 18:19.066
Man, fuck that motherfucker,
we're going straight for James

18:19.149 --> 18:21.110
'cause James is the real money around here.

18:21.151 --> 18:23.529
Boy, you gotta treat
that psycho-ass nigga just right.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.699
'Cause that motherfucker will kill your ass
just as much as talk to you.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.909
But we gotta fuck with him just right.

18:28.993 --> 18:32.413
Take it out of here just enough
so we get the odds that we want.

18:32.496 --> 18:35.916
Then we drop that motherfucker down.
But, fuck, you know he got Hammerman.

18:35.958 --> 18:37.251
But Hammerman ain't never put down.

18:37.334 --> 18:41.255
That's when your ass comes in.
You gotta whoop that motherfucker's ass!

18:41.338 --> 18:42.631
Yeah!

18:46.302 --> 18:48.345
What can you tell me about the girl?

18:49.680 --> 18:52.766
Fuck that. Hell no, no. No.

18:52.850 --> 18:55.102
Get that shit out your head right now, man.
Fuck that.

18:55.185 --> 18:57.521
You need to sit right there and have
a long, introspective conversation

18:57.563 --> 18:59.940
- with your dick there, homes.
- Tell me about the girl.

18:59.982 --> 19:03.444
She's James's girl.
That's all the fuck you need to know.

19:07.239 --> 19:08.574
Fuck me.

19:11.285 --> 19:13.412
Angela Soto. All right, that's her name.

19:14.163 --> 19:16.415
James turned her real bad

19:16.498 --> 19:20.377
She was married, matter of fact,
to a man, a choirboy

19:20.502 --> 19:22.129
I forget his name

19:22.504 --> 19:23.881
Word on the street is,

19:23.922 --> 19:27.885
James set him up, triple homicide,
sent his black ass to jail.

19:28.385 --> 19:30.512
James just swooped in,
snatched the girl for himself

19:30.554 --> 19:32.056
But the fucked up thing is,

19:32.097 --> 19:33.849
I heard she was pregnant.

19:33.974 --> 19:37.603
This motherfucker took her to a clinic
and got that baby...

19:37.686 --> 19:39.104
After that,

19:39.271 --> 19:42.566
she got hooked on the horse
and that's the end of that sordid tale.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.818
Don't you ever tell me
to tell you that story again because

19:44.902 --> 19:48.864
that's the type of shit that make a brother
lose all hope in humanity and shit.

19:48.947 --> 19:50.741
You know what I'm saying?

19:50.824 --> 19:51.825
Yeah.

19:55.537 --> 19:58.707
So this guy, first time up, first hole,

19:58.832 --> 20:00.793
first game, he swears,

20:01.585 --> 20:03.629
par five, shoots an eagle.

20:03.712 --> 20:05.631
An eagle, first try!

20:05.881 --> 20:08.050
- Couldn't believe it.
- Wait. That reminds me, Darryl,

20:08.092 --> 20:09.927
you get that thing off to Franklin?

20:10.052 --> 20:12.721
Franklin, dude,
don't even worry about that guy.

20:16.350 --> 20:18.268
We could have some music.

20:18.352 --> 20:19.520
- Yes.
- Good idea.

20:19.603 --> 20:21.647
- Well, I'll get it, baby.
- Okay, okay.

20:22.272 --> 20:24.608
Yeah, I'm usually shooting like a 79, 80.

20:24.692 --> 20:27.111
This guy, 72, first game.

20:33.117 --> 20:36.620
A little white-boy music to aid digestion?

20:37.204 --> 20:40.499
What's wrong, you don't think that
brothers are down with Wang Chung?

20:40.624 --> 20:42.835
Take your baby by the hand

20:42.918 --> 20:44.545
See, he knows it.

20:45.546 --> 20:48.048
Make her do a high handstand

20:50.092 --> 20:52.136
Take your baby by the heels

20:52.219 --> 20:54.346
- Come on, sing with me.
- See?

20:54.638 --> 20:56.974
- Do the next thing that you feel
- Do the next thing that you feel

20:57.057 --> 20:58.976
Sing with me. You don't know it, right?

20:59.018 --> 21:02.104
- We were so in phase
- We were so in phase

21:03.564 --> 21:06.984
- In our dance hall days
- In our dance hall days

21:08.402 --> 21:11.613
- We were cool on craze
- We were cool on craze

21:12.990 --> 21:17.536
- When I, you, and everyone we knew
- When I, you, and everyone we knew

21:17.703 --> 21:19.955
- Could believe, do
- Could believe, do

21:19.997 --> 21:22.166
- and share in what was true
- and share in what was true

21:22.249 --> 21:24.084
Darryl,

21:24.209 --> 21:25.878
don't take this personal.

21:27.087 --> 21:28.088
What?

21:28.505 --> 21:31.175
- Get over here!
- Oh, my God!

21:35.471 --> 21:36.930
Shut the fuck up!

21:38.807 --> 21:40.309
Shut up, shut up.

22:07.419 --> 22:08.420
God!

23:07.521 --> 23:09.606
What good are you anymore?

23:13.152 --> 23:15.237
You ain't nothing but a junkie.

23:50.522 --> 23:52.066
What is the music on that thing?

23:52.149 --> 23:53.901
It's a new joint, man.

23:53.942 --> 23:57.404
By what's-his-name, you know,
the cat does the song, Homegirl

23:57.446 --> 24:00.824
Yeah, well turn it off.
You know I don't like profanity in my home.

24:00.866 --> 24:02.534
My bad. It's off.

24:03.452 --> 24:05.079
What is that thing anyway?

24:05.162 --> 24:07.581
That, man, is the PKL 370.

24:07.665 --> 24:09.541
Better known as the Pickle.

24:09.583 --> 24:13.212
And check it. If I call you up,
all you gotta do is press star 40,

24:13.629 --> 24:17.758
and it automatically activates a GPS
that can find you anywhere by satellite.

24:17.841 --> 24:19.009
It's tight, huh?

24:19.301 --> 24:22.805
You know if you ever use that thing on me,
I will kill you.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.226
I'm messing with you, man.

24:31.855 --> 24:33.315
Check this out.

24:35.317 --> 24:36.318
One kick.

24:36.735 --> 24:39.196
Folded up Big Lamont like a paper bag.

24:42.074 --> 24:43.534
Where's he from?

24:43.826 --> 24:46.120
Only cat that knows is Pinball.

24:47.121 --> 24:48.122
Okay.

24:54.295 --> 24:56.213
Here's my boy.

24:56.297 --> 24:57.965
You're my babies.

25:00.759 --> 25:02.761
Get back, get back, get back, get back.

25:02.845 --> 25:04.013
Get back.

25:05.472 --> 25:08.017
- What's wrong with you?
- They eat dogs in China.

25:08.058 --> 25:10.477
Get in here. Come on, man.

25:13.689 --> 25:14.690
Yeah.

25:15.274 --> 25:17.192
Them motherfuckers...

25:17.234 --> 25:18.319
Sorry?

25:18.694 --> 25:21.488
Just saying,
they're looking at me like Chinese takeout.

25:21.530 --> 25:24.325
It's because you don't know
how to treat them.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.538
Just like everything else, you just gotta
show them who their master is.

25:29.621 --> 25:30.831
You ready?

25:30.914 --> 25:31.957
For what?

25:31.999 --> 25:33.834
Just tell me if you're ready.

25:33.876 --> 25:35.961
Yeah, I'm ready, man, I'm ready.
What? What?

25:36.045 --> 25:38.255
- Kill.
- James, stop messing around, James.

25:38.297 --> 25:39.673
Stop messing around, man.

25:40.090 --> 25:42.217
Get them motherfucking dogs
away from me, man.

25:42.301 --> 25:43.302
Stop.

25:45.638 --> 25:47.806
What did I tell you about cursing?

25:49.224 --> 25:53.729
Remember, profanity is a brutal vice.
He that uses it is no gentleman.

25:56.982 --> 26:00.486
I gotta warn you,
I'm always thinking three moves ahead.

26:04.156 --> 26:07.284
- He's looking fresh today.
- Yeah, yeah, with his church shoes on.

26:07.368 --> 26:08.744
Yeah, I mean, he likes this bike, right?

26:08.827 --> 26:10.120
- I know you feeling it.
- See this?

26:10.162 --> 26:11.705
- You see the bling?
- Bling, bling, bling.

26:11.789 --> 26:14.333
You want that, right? You want that.
A fiend for that.

26:14.416 --> 26:17.670
Jared! Get your little behind up here
right now.

26:19.588 --> 26:22.841
Hey! You two good-for-nothings,
take that... Get off this block!

26:22.883 --> 26:24.093
Man, fuck you,

26:24.176 --> 26:26.637
you gray-haired,
Grandpa Moses-looking motherfucker.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.056
You Metamucil-drinking-ass motherfucker.

26:29.264 --> 26:31.725
You don't want me to come down there,
do you?

26:36.105 --> 26:37.314
All right.

26:43.362 --> 26:44.989
It's all in the tone of your voice.

26:45.072 --> 26:47.533
That's how you get things done around here.

26:48.409 --> 26:49.618
Hey, yo, Bone!

26:49.702 --> 26:51.412
Time to go, partner.

26:52.329 --> 26:53.414
That's checkmate.

26:53.497 --> 26:54.748
What? Checkmate?

26:54.832 --> 26:56.750
I play four moves ahead.

27:06.302 --> 27:07.261
Here.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.181
Damn.

27:13.225 --> 27:16.895
I'm not sure I approve
of the company you keep, Mr. Bone.

27:19.315 --> 27:20.649
Me, neither.

27:34.246 --> 27:35.247
Hey.

27:36.665 --> 27:38.876
You know Car Wash is not just a movie.

27:39.293 --> 27:43.297
This may seem like some old
underground fight club shit, low-key and all.

27:43.380 --> 27:45.382
These motherfuckers can scrap, though.

27:53.557 --> 27:55.392
You see that chick? I used to hit that.

27:55.476 --> 27:57.019
Pretty hot for a fighter, huh?

28:02.566 --> 28:03.609
Not anymore.

28:03.692 --> 28:05.235
Shit.

28:09.657 --> 28:11.283
And the winner is,

28:11.825 --> 28:14.787
the vindictive Veretta Vendetta!

28:14.953 --> 28:16.997
Don't get on her bad side, homies.

28:17.081 --> 28:18.415
That's fucking right.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.884
Tatt, what up?

28:29.259 --> 28:30.511
- What's up, man?
- Chilling.

28:30.594 --> 28:35.391
So, check this out. I got this new fighter.
I'll bet you $5000, what you think?

28:35.474 --> 28:37.726
- Who?
- That man right there, Bone.

28:37.935 --> 28:40.479
I'm talking about your best fighter
right now. Five G's.

28:40.562 --> 28:42.606
- My best fighter?
- Your best fighter.

28:42.648 --> 28:43.857
- All right, man.
- All right?

28:43.941 --> 28:45.275
- Yeah.
- Five G's?

28:45.359 --> 28:46.652
All right.

28:50.364 --> 28:52.533
Okay, we got the next fight.

28:53.242 --> 28:56.328
Over here we got this guy, Bone.

28:57.413 --> 29:00.791
He seems to think he can come here
and take all our money.

29:00.833 --> 29:05.254
But tonight, he's gotta put it all up
against the man with the golden grill.

29:05.546 --> 29:09.383
Yeah. Now we already seen
what he does to a dude that he likes.

29:09.425 --> 29:13.012
And I don't think he likes
this guy Bone very much, does he?

29:15.889 --> 29:17.891
Okay. You guys ready?

29:19.476 --> 29:20.436
Fight!

29:27.484 --> 29:28.694
Holy shit.

29:28.777 --> 29:31.071
What technique! What technique!

29:31.196 --> 29:33.365
You ever see some shit like that?
I never seen no shit like that.

29:33.407 --> 29:36.243
My man Bone will wreck shop
on your punk-ass fighters, man.

29:36.327 --> 29:38.662
Two at a time, bitches! Two at a time!

29:38.704 --> 29:40.414
- Pay me, Tattoo. Pay me.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:40.497 --> 29:42.207
What'd you say, two at a time?

29:42.333 --> 29:43.542
Is that what you said, two?

29:43.626 --> 29:46.045
Hey, everybody heard that?
Two at a time, okay?

29:46.128 --> 29:49.089
- That's the bet. Two at a time.
- No, no, no, no, what bet? What bet?

29:49.173 --> 29:50.174
Hey, hey, calm down, homie.

29:50.257 --> 29:52.384
That's what you just said,
two at a time, right?

29:52.426 --> 29:53.719
Hey, Carlos, Manuel.

29:53.802 --> 29:55.804
Hold on. No, no, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

29:55.888 --> 29:57.848
You said two at a time.

29:57.890 --> 30:00.100
- What, you scared? You gonna forfeit?
- Fuck that, man. Fuck you!

30:00.184 --> 30:01.477
Fuck you, homie.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.853
Fuck you.

30:03.687 --> 30:06.607
Your man as good as he says he is?
Let's do it.

30:06.649 --> 30:09.318
- This is bullshit.
- Double or nothing.

30:09.360 --> 30:12.613
No, no, no. Bone, Bone,
he owes us money right the fuck now!

30:12.696 --> 30:14.239
Double or nothing.

30:15.783 --> 30:18.494
Double or nothing.
Get this motherfucker, man.

30:42.309 --> 30:43.852
What the fuck?

30:46.939 --> 30:48.357
That's double.

30:48.482 --> 30:50.859
- Wanna double up again?
- Hey, hey, hey.

30:51.443 --> 30:54.238
David, Jesus, Lorenzo,
get this motherfucker, man.

31:01.996 --> 31:04.415
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

31:04.498 --> 31:08.711
One, two, three!
Uno, dos, tres, homes, just like that. What?

31:10.129 --> 31:12.131
First bet was $5000.

31:12.172 --> 31:14.216
Double or nothing on the second made it 10.

31:14.550 --> 31:15.801
No fucking way, homie.

31:15.843 --> 31:17.928
- Double that made it 20.
- Hey.

31:18.595 --> 31:20.139
- Hey!
- You wanna triple?

31:20.222 --> 31:22.266
Hell no, motherfucker. Hell no!

31:22.349 --> 31:24.268
Hey, you said this motherfucker
was a beginner.

31:24.310 --> 31:25.728
You said he just got started, homie.

31:25.769 --> 31:27.104
You said this motherfucker
was a beginner, homie.

31:27.187 --> 31:28.731
- No. No, you took the bet.
- I ain't having it, man.

31:28.814 --> 31:30.316
You took the action. Time to pay up!

31:30.357 --> 31:32.484
You want your money, homie?
You want your money?

31:32.568 --> 31:35.154
Give me the fucking money, man.
You want your money? You see it?

31:35.237 --> 31:36.905
It's right here, baby.

31:37.448 --> 31:38.907
Come and get it.

31:39.533 --> 31:41.952
What, motherfucker? Come and get it.

31:42.578 --> 31:45.539
Pussies. These pussy motherfuckers, man.

31:45.956 --> 31:47.249
- Right here.
- What the...

31:47.333 --> 31:48.834
Right here. What?

31:49.001 --> 31:50.002
Right there!

32:04.350 --> 32:08.479
What now? You all weren't expecting
no superhero shit like that, huh?

32:24.119 --> 32:25.120
Call me.

32:32.711 --> 32:33.963
Goddamn.

32:34.004 --> 32:37.549
You just took out the whole village.
The whole fucking village.

32:40.552 --> 32:42.763
You know where that's been, right?

32:42.846 --> 32:44.431
Goddamn, you are one crazy son of a bitch.

32:44.515 --> 32:46.934
I never met no crazy motherfucker like you.
You know what I'm saying?

32:47.017 --> 32:49.728
This motherfucker won't... Oh, shit!

32:51.772 --> 32:53.899
Pussy motherfuckers, where you going?

32:54.483 --> 32:56.151
Motherfuckers!

33:41.196 --> 33:42.489
Ante up.

34:40.755 --> 34:42.091
Break his hand.

34:54.353 --> 34:57.022
Come on, break them off, man.
Break them off.

35:06.156 --> 35:07.574
Get the money.

35:24.967 --> 35:26.176
Man,

35:26.969 --> 35:29.763
my whole life
motherfuckers played me for a mark.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.725
Act like I'm some kind of punk.

35:32.766 --> 35:35.144
Inside, I always felt like a baller

35:35.728 --> 35:38.105
even though my pockets were flat.

35:38.772 --> 35:40.983
And now it's all coming true.

35:41.025 --> 35:42.860
And it's all because of you, B.

35:44.278 --> 35:46.322
So what I'm trying to say is,

35:51.035 --> 35:52.494
I love you, B.

35:53.370 --> 35:57.041
I don't mean that in a homosexual,
I'm-trying-to-get-with-you kind of way.

35:57.082 --> 35:58.709
I mean that in like...

35:59.501 --> 36:00.919
Like a motherfucker who, now,

36:00.961 --> 36:02.546
he-got-a-ride-to-match-his-rims
kind of way.

36:02.630 --> 36:05.007
You know what I'm saying? That's love.

36:08.344 --> 36:10.804
Damn. That was way mellow and shit.

36:19.647 --> 36:21.357
What happened to you?

36:24.318 --> 36:26.028
I had an accident.

36:26.111 --> 36:28.656
What did you do,
trip and fall on someone's fist?

36:28.739 --> 36:30.032
Come here.

36:31.742 --> 36:33.035
Come here.

36:34.078 --> 36:35.245
Sit down.

36:47.383 --> 36:49.259
Are you always up this early?

36:49.301 --> 36:52.721
Yes. To make breakfast for the children.

36:55.599 --> 36:57.977
You take good care of those kids.

36:58.644 --> 37:03.107
Yeah, well, I do what I have to do to
stop them from being killers, thugs, hos,

37:03.440 --> 37:04.858
street fighters.

37:09.196 --> 37:11.448
You have any family, Mr. Bone?

37:13.450 --> 37:14.952
Long time ago.

37:17.288 --> 37:18.789
What happened?

37:21.166 --> 37:23.919
So, how long you been
taking care of the kids?

37:26.213 --> 37:27.339
Well...

37:28.424 --> 37:30.884
Angel I've had for three years,

37:32.052 --> 37:34.513
Regina, about a year and a half,

37:35.347 --> 37:38.267
and Jared, about a year.

37:40.019 --> 37:42.813
Why does Jared
always stand at the window?

37:45.858 --> 37:48.402
He's waiting for his folks to come back.

37:52.781 --> 37:55.701
As far as I know, his father's in jail.

37:57.119 --> 38:00.039
But he does have a mother
out there somewhere.

38:06.086 --> 38:07.421
Thank you.

38:08.005 --> 38:13.385
You know I saw you doing tai chi out there.

38:16.013 --> 38:19.600
I watch the old people do it in the park,
you know?

38:21.518 --> 38:27.441
It just always looks so beautiful,
so relaxing.

38:31.028 --> 38:32.321
Come here.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.744
Let me show you something.

38:43.624 --> 38:44.583
Okay.

38:45.459 --> 38:49.046
This is tai chi. This is called Push Hands.

38:49.922 --> 38:51.924
Step with your right foot.

38:52.675 --> 38:54.218
Put your hand here.

38:54.885 --> 38:58.222
Now, this hand goes on my elbow.

38:59.598 --> 39:02.059
Now, this is called Push Hands.

39:02.101 --> 39:04.812
When I push, you yield,

39:05.646 --> 39:08.565
roll back and push me.

39:09.817 --> 39:11.151
Just like that.

39:12.319 --> 39:14.071
And push with your hand.

39:14.947 --> 39:16.699
And roll back.

39:18.742 --> 39:19.702
There you go.

40:06.373 --> 40:07.458
Checkmate.

40:19.595 --> 40:22.473
Five moves ahead, young'un.

40:37.946 --> 40:39.031
Shit!

40:41.283 --> 40:42.826
Why you running?

40:43.202 --> 40:44.787
You know you're gonna twist an ankle.

40:44.870 --> 40:47.748
I didn't do it, James. I swear I didn't do it.

40:47.831 --> 40:49.750
Do what? Why are you running?

40:49.833 --> 40:54.004
'Cause I know he told you what you
think I did, but I didn't do it, James.

40:54.088 --> 40:57.132
I swear.
I put that on my babies, James, please.

40:57.216 --> 40:59.635
Then why don't you stop running
and tell me your side?

40:59.677 --> 41:02.304
'Cause ain't nobody got no other side
with you, James!

41:02.346 --> 41:04.431
You think I'm that one-sided?
I'm that one-sided?

41:04.515 --> 41:06.684
Monique, I am hurt. I am hurt.

41:06.850 --> 41:08.852
Will you stop climbing that fence?

41:08.936 --> 41:11.438
You are giving me a complex over here.

41:12.982 --> 41:14.358
You know what?

41:28.914 --> 41:30.416
Man, James.

41:31.208 --> 41:33.919
- She's messed up.
- Now I feel bad.

42:02.614 --> 42:04.116
Come on, let's go.

42:15.044 --> 42:16.295
Shit.

42:16.545 --> 42:19.089
Kind of motherfucking name is Bone?

42:19.590 --> 42:21.592
He's about to get boned by the Hammer.

42:22.134 --> 42:24.303
Know what I'm saying?

42:28.932 --> 42:30.893
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

42:30.934 --> 42:32.144
Hold steady.

42:32.936 --> 42:35.064
Just knock this motherfucker out.

42:35.773 --> 42:38.942
Afterwards, we'll get those little schoolgirls.
You know what I'm saying?

42:39.026 --> 42:41.111
You ready for this, Hammer? You ready?

42:41.195 --> 42:42.738
- Yeah!
- Let's do this!

42:42.821 --> 42:44.698
Let do this! I don't smell no Hammer.

42:44.782 --> 42:46.617
I smell pussy! Are you a pussy?

42:46.700 --> 42:48.243
No! No! You're the Hammerman!

42:48.285 --> 42:49.578
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

42:50.621 --> 42:52.331
What's up, James? How you doing, fam?

42:52.414 --> 42:53.958
Got your money?

42:56.418 --> 42:59.672
Well, there it is, just waiting for you
to give it a little company.

42:59.755 --> 43:01.256
You need to count it?

43:05.844 --> 43:07.221
Bring him up.

43:09.640 --> 43:13.727
Step to the rear,
'cause the Hammer is here! Yeah!

43:15.270 --> 43:18.399
You know that thing you always say
every time I fight?

43:18.482 --> 43:20.526
What? You mean,

43:20.609 --> 43:23.362
"They call him Bone because
that's what he break when he hits"?

43:23.404 --> 43:25.781
- Yeah.
- Don't say that.

43:28.158 --> 43:30.411
All right motherfuckers
and motherfuckettes,

43:30.452 --> 43:31.954
it's time for the main event.

43:32.037 --> 43:36.083
Now, without further ado,
let me bring to you,

43:36.166 --> 43:38.419
coming straight from Skull Island.

43:38.460 --> 43:40.587
Y'all might know him
from his numerous appearances

43:40.629 --> 43:42.548
atop the Empire State Building,

43:42.631 --> 43:44.717
swatting down airplanes and shit,

43:44.758 --> 43:47.219
the primate from another climate,

43:47.303 --> 43:50.139
the Hammerman!

43:51.056 --> 43:53.100
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

43:53.350 --> 43:56.186
But now, coming from this corner,

43:56.228 --> 43:59.106
he's new on the scene,
but he's stacking much green.

43:59.189 --> 44:01.233
The one-technique knockout artist

44:01.317 --> 44:04.653
who's breaking down pros
like they just got started.

44:04.695 --> 44:06.780
The brother man with death in each hand,

44:06.864 --> 44:09.366
the man they call Bone, because...

44:10.826 --> 44:13.495
Because that's what his parents named him.

44:13.579 --> 44:15.039
Bone!

44:16.248 --> 44:18.834
And now, you hedonistic savages,

44:19.501 --> 44:20.836
knuckle up!

44:37.811 --> 44:39.021
Come on, baby.

44:55.829 --> 44:56.830
Shit.

44:58.707 --> 44:59.792
Shit.

44:59.875 --> 45:02.336
Tastes like a Timberland boot, bitch.

45:27.653 --> 45:30.990
The man Bone! The winner is my man Bone!

45:31.073 --> 45:33.867
Yo, Hammy, he just took
your juiced-up ass to college.

45:33.951 --> 45:35.244
Bone, bitches.

45:35.494 --> 45:37.788
Yeah, yeah, no, get the money, right.
Get the money.

45:37.871 --> 45:40.666
That's the deal. Get the money, bitches.

45:40.749 --> 45:43.377
That motherfucker Bones is the truth.

45:46.130 --> 45:49.758
What can I say, James?
Homeboy just got lucky.

45:50.843 --> 45:52.803
Yeah, well, like they say,

45:53.178 --> 45:55.222
every dog has its day.

45:56.473 --> 45:58.600
This is yours, I guess.

46:11.238 --> 46:12.448
Watch his leg.

46:12.531 --> 46:13.616
My leg, man.

46:15.159 --> 46:17.161
- It's just my leg.
- Put no weight on it.

46:18.162 --> 46:19.330
Take it.

46:29.923 --> 46:33.260
Mr. Bone, that was one hell of a show.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.932
I never seen anything like that
before in my life.

46:40.851 --> 46:42.603
You know, you cost me a lot of money.

46:42.686 --> 46:44.396
I hear you got a lot.

46:45.522 --> 46:46.732
Not really.

46:47.483 --> 46:53.989
You know, why don't you and Pinball
come by my place, celebrate?

46:54.990 --> 46:56.659
That way we can talk.

46:56.742 --> 46:59.370
I'm sorry, James, we got some plans.

46:59.954 --> 47:01.288
We'll be there.

47:02.498 --> 47:03.707
Good.

47:07.169 --> 47:11.298
You know, invincibility lies in defense.

47:11.757 --> 47:14.385
Possibility of victory in the attack.

47:21.183 --> 47:23.644
You ain't got no qualm with the Asiatic.

47:30.192 --> 47:31.819
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

47:32.611 --> 47:34.488
Glad you two could make it.

47:35.155 --> 47:38.325
Well, I didn't think you'd want to see us
after we won that money from you tonight.

47:38.409 --> 47:40.744
Well, I guess it had to happen
sooner or later.

47:40.828 --> 47:43.539
Didn't know you had a secret weapon.

47:43.998 --> 47:47.459
Poor, old Hammer's at the hospital
straightening out his knee.

47:48.252 --> 47:50.879
Hey, baby, come meet my man, Bone.

47:51.588 --> 47:54.133
He just whooped the Hammerman.

48:01.223 --> 48:04.560
Words can't describe
how little I give a damn.

48:20.409 --> 48:22.911
Come, come, walk with me. Talk.

48:25.956 --> 48:28.208
Where'd you learn how to fight?

48:29.001 --> 48:30.294
Here and there.

48:31.003 --> 48:32.254
Here and there.

48:35.007 --> 48:37.092
I got something to show you.

48:39.303 --> 48:43.182
I've always admired fighters
and the fight game.

48:44.350 --> 48:46.602
A warrior's life, that's the life for me.

48:46.644 --> 48:49.063
There's honor and virtue.

48:50.356 --> 48:52.983
A warrior's life must be pure in body
and in spirit.

48:53.067 --> 48:56.403
That's why I don't drink,
I don't smoke, I don't use profanity.

48:57.488 --> 49:00.491
Genghis Khan once said,
the greatest pleasure

49:01.033 --> 49:04.495
is to vanquish your enemies
and chase them before you,

49:05.537 --> 49:09.833
to rob them of their wealth
and to have those dear to them

49:10.334 --> 49:11.961
bathed in tears.

49:15.756 --> 49:19.009
I am the punishment of God.

49:20.010 --> 49:22.972
And if you had not committed great sins,

49:23.055 --> 49:26.183
God would not have sent a punishment
like me upon you.

49:28.268 --> 49:29.436
Genghis Khan.

49:31.855 --> 49:33.148
You see?

49:34.858 --> 49:38.404
I am not like the rest of those thugs
you see out there

49:38.487 --> 49:43.242
smoking blunts and playing video games,
and neither are you.

49:44.285 --> 49:46.245
I could see that right off.

49:46.996 --> 49:48.747
Do you train with weapons?

49:50.582 --> 49:51.583
Catch.

49:54.128 --> 49:55.796
Hey, hey, hey.

49:58.257 --> 49:59.967
Now, I guess you're thinking,

50:00.968 --> 50:06.724
what does this street hustler know
about honor and nobility?

50:09.101 --> 50:12.021
Well, the truth of the matter is,
not very much.

50:12.896 --> 50:14.440
But I am learning.

50:15.733 --> 50:17.776
I have a path, I have a vision, I have a plan

50:17.818 --> 50:20.779
that I would very much like you
to be a part of.

50:22.823 --> 50:23.782
How so?

50:24.408 --> 50:26.660
International underground street fighting
is by far

50:26.744 --> 50:30.873
the biggest moneymaking
fight game, period.

50:31.874 --> 50:34.835
It is the pastime for a group of fat cats

50:34.877 --> 50:38.339
who like to call themselves The Consortium.

50:38.422 --> 50:41.842
This is the game
that I am trying to get into.

50:45.429 --> 50:46.847
You got an in?

50:47.181 --> 50:50.184
You ever hear of a man
called Franklin McVeigh?

50:50.225 --> 50:51.268
No.

50:51.352 --> 50:55.981
Franklin McVeigh is
an international arms dealer. Large.

50:56.065 --> 51:00.527
If there's a war in this world, that fool
is probably providing the party favors.

51:00.819 --> 51:04.365
But he wasn't always this big.
He was a small-time thug from London,

51:04.448 --> 51:06.408
selling pop guns
to the little black and brown kids

51:06.492 --> 51:07.493
on the streets of America.

51:07.576 --> 51:10.162
Needless to say, that is where I met him.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.247
Anyway,

51:12.873 --> 51:17.878
Franklin McVeigh runs the international
fight game for The Consortium.

51:19.254 --> 51:22.716
And he manages
the best fighter in the world.

51:27.054 --> 51:28.931
They call him Pretty Boy Price

51:29.014 --> 51:30.349
Now, don't let his looks fool you

51:30.432 --> 51:33.102
He has already killed four men in the ring

51:34.645 --> 51:38.482
Pound for pound, he's considered
the best fighter in the world.

51:40.567 --> 51:44.405
It costs five million dollars
to get in the ring with him.

51:46.532 --> 51:51.036
Now, ordinarily, you would have to
work your way up the ranks

51:52.329 --> 51:54.290
to get a fight with Price.

51:55.541 --> 51:57.001
But McVeigh owes me.

51:59.253 --> 52:03.966
I wanna do to Franklin McVeigh
what you and Pinball did to me.

52:05.009 --> 52:06.719
You beat Price,

52:07.428 --> 52:09.722
you can retire a very rich man.

52:11.140 --> 52:12.725
I'll think about it.

52:12.808 --> 52:14.768
What is there to think about?

52:16.353 --> 52:19.231
Like I said, I'll think about it.

52:20.232 --> 52:22.860
Okay, my friend. You do that.

52:24.153 --> 52:25.904
But you should know

52:28.198 --> 52:30.576
I don't like people that say no to me.

52:31.952 --> 52:33.871
Maybe you should get used to it.

53:15.412 --> 53:17.539
This what you're looking for?

53:20.542 --> 53:21.627
No.

53:21.669 --> 53:23.921
I need you to do something for me first.

53:26.423 --> 53:27.758
Come with me.

53:30.177 --> 53:31.470
What now?

53:38.185 --> 53:42.314
Do you see that man
that you keep looking at?

53:46.860 --> 53:48.445
I want you...

53:53.534 --> 53:55.494
Fuck you and the mule you rode in on.

53:55.536 --> 53:59.540
Hey! What'd I tell you about that language?

53:59.832 --> 54:01.417
Fuck you.

54:02.835 --> 54:04.044
Come here.

54:11.969 --> 54:14.263
Do you know what I can do to you?

54:16.265 --> 54:17.850
Look at me.

54:18.600 --> 54:21.228
No, really, look at me.

54:26.442 --> 54:29.069
Now, you know what I'm capable of, right?

54:33.407 --> 54:34.867
And you know

54:36.660 --> 54:38.454
that I'll do it, too.

54:49.214 --> 54:51.592
So why don't you go over there

54:52.718 --> 54:56.221
and do what I told you to do?

55:02.436 --> 55:03.646
Come with me.

55:31.548 --> 55:35.302
"Take care of my wife and my kid. "

55:37.471 --> 55:39.264
That's what he told me.

55:40.891 --> 55:43.686
That's the last thing he said before he died.

55:45.896 --> 55:46.981
Who?

55:52.319 --> 55:53.904
Who do you think?

56:01.203 --> 56:02.371
Danny.

56:33.152 --> 56:34.820
You knew Danny?

56:38.157 --> 56:39.617
How?

56:39.658 --> 56:41.035
In prison.

56:43.912 --> 56:45.456
He was my friend

56:47.791 --> 56:51.337
Well, sorry to do this to you, but...

56:53.047 --> 56:54.340
Checkmate.

56:56.925 --> 56:58.052
Man.

57:00.512 --> 57:02.348
Hey, check this out, man.

57:07.978 --> 57:10.314
It's a beautiful picture, man.

57:10.522 --> 57:12.024
That's my family.

57:13.025 --> 57:14.693
My wife and my son.

57:15.486 --> 57:18.697
Never got a chance to meet him,
but I'm gonna see him soon.

57:25.245 --> 57:27.873
You know, you remind me of my brother.

57:27.915 --> 57:30.125
Really? You have a brother?

57:31.001 --> 57:32.586
Had a brother.

57:32.670 --> 57:33.879
A twin.

57:36.090 --> 57:37.800
What happened to him?

57:40.010 --> 57:41.762
Somebody killed him.

57:42.721 --> 57:44.348
Thought he was me.

57:53.107 --> 57:54.692
Some chess.

58:00.155 --> 58:01.282
Come here.

58:04.118 --> 58:06.287
All inmates to their cells, now!

58:06.370 --> 58:08.038
- Go!
- Lock it down, lock it down.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.498
Back in your cells!

58:17.548 --> 58:18.799
Come here.

58:20.843 --> 58:22.303
Tell me something.

58:22.386 --> 58:23.929
Is this the woman that Danny cried over

58:24.013 --> 58:26.974
and begged me to look after
as he was dying?

58:27.933 --> 58:29.018
Danny.

58:29.935 --> 58:32.187
Did you forget you had a son?

58:32.271 --> 58:33.856
Don't you judge me.

58:33.939 --> 58:35.983
Don't you fucking judge me!

58:37.359 --> 58:41.238
The whole reason I'm in this shit
is because of Danny and my son.

58:42.489 --> 58:45.159
I knew James set him up to get to me.

58:47.494 --> 58:50.331
I also knew that if he couldn't have me,

58:54.668 --> 58:57.171
he would've killed Danny and my son.

59:17.775 --> 59:20.986
I always hoped he'd get tired of me
and let me go.

59:22.029 --> 59:23.739
I could find my son.

59:25.491 --> 59:27.910
But that's all just a pipe dream.

59:29.745 --> 59:31.997
I don't know where my son is.

59:33.832 --> 59:36.001
I don't even know if he's alive.

59:44.802 --> 59:47.304
Your son is alive and I know where he is.

59:48.514 --> 59:52.267
So let's get you cleaned up
and go get your son.

59:56.188 --> 59:58.983
So that's what
this whole thing is about, huh?

01:00:02.695 --> 01:00:05.948
You're my white knight here
to save me from the tower?

01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:09.952
Well, I don't know about white knight.

01:00:14.373 --> 01:00:19.336
Okay, just play along, smile,
act like we just had a good time.

01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:23.882
That's good.

01:00:27.678 --> 01:00:28.679
So?

01:00:32.016 --> 01:00:35.227
So I think I'm gonna like this organization.

01:00:38.856 --> 01:00:41.233
You don't look any worse for wear.

01:00:42.026 --> 01:00:43.444
Why should I?

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:48.407
It feels good to make love to a real man.

01:00:52.286 --> 01:00:53.537
Hey, listen.

01:00:54.747 --> 01:00:56.290
If you're tired of her,

01:00:57.499 --> 01:01:00.961
why don't you let me take her off
your hands for a while?

01:01:06.383 --> 01:01:08.761
Well, I might consider to do that.

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.556
Depends upon
what you're willing to do for me.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.725
What you think?

01:01:18.687 --> 01:01:20.731
Get your stuff together.

01:01:22.232 --> 01:01:24.652
You're going with Bone for a while.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:28.739
And don't forget your medicine.

01:01:43.837 --> 01:01:46.465
So we'll talk about this later, right?

01:01:49.218 --> 01:01:50.594
All right?

01:02:01.313 --> 01:02:03.273
Where are you taking me?

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:07.653
Someplace where you can
get yourself back together.

01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:10.155
Okay.

01:02:13.325 --> 01:02:14.660
So, what's up?

01:02:17.496 --> 01:02:18.998
See all that?

01:02:21.959 --> 01:02:23.544
All that is mine.

01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:27.089
Every block, every sidewalk, every alley.

01:02:33.512 --> 01:02:34.972
It's all so

01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:38.642
dark and unsophisticated.

01:02:38.726 --> 01:02:41.603
It is not where I wanna be anymore.

01:02:45.149 --> 01:02:47.818
- It's anonymous, right?
- Absolutely, sir.

01:02:51.697 --> 01:02:52.656
We're good.

01:02:53.741 --> 01:02:56.785
What about my son? I want to see my son.

01:02:57.244 --> 01:02:59.079
Not till you're straight.

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:04.084
This way, miss.

01:03:07.755 --> 01:03:08.714
Bone.

01:03:11.717 --> 01:03:13.052
Thank you.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:57.137
Good to see you, James.
You should visit more often.

01:03:57.388 --> 01:04:00.975
- I hear you've become quite the golfer.
- Yes.

01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:04.937
But unfortunately,
I just lost my golfing partner.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:08.524
You, my friend,
should learn the fine art of subtlety.

01:04:09.692 --> 01:04:12.653
So what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

01:04:18.409 --> 01:04:20.160
Five million dollars.

01:04:20.661 --> 01:04:22.079
What's this for?

01:04:22.746 --> 01:04:25.582
I want a fight with your pretty boy.

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:29.878
So we're looking to sit
at the grownups' table, are we?

01:04:30.254 --> 01:04:31.880
I have a fighter.

01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:35.467
This guy's the real deal.

01:04:35.551 --> 01:04:37.136
You're not talking about Hammerman,
are you?

01:04:37.219 --> 01:04:39.054
He's not even in Price's league.

01:04:39.096 --> 01:04:42.224
No, this is a new guy. Best I've ever seen.

01:04:42.266 --> 01:04:44.018
And I've seen Price.

01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:46.603
Well, it's not as simple as that, James.

01:04:46.687 --> 01:04:50.482
The Consortium
is owned by a private organization.

01:04:50.566 --> 01:04:54.278
All newcomers have to be agreed upon
by committee.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.946
Come on, Franklin.

01:04:57.406 --> 01:05:00.534
After all I've done for you,
you couldn't do me this one little thing?

01:05:00.576 --> 01:05:03.245
You're asking me to vouch for you.

01:05:04.997 --> 01:05:08.208
Well, the funny thing about vouching for
someone, James,

01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:10.419
is that when that someone
shows themselves

01:05:10.544 --> 01:05:12.755
to be less than what was promised,

01:05:12.838 --> 01:05:16.634
every decision you take from that point
on is second-guessed.

01:05:16.884 --> 01:05:19.803
And that, in my line of work,

01:05:20.137 --> 01:05:21.597
is suicide.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:27.519
Besides, why does a cool,
mellow fellow like yourself

01:05:27.603 --> 01:05:32.066
want to hang around with a bunch of
stuffy, old white guys?

01:05:32.149 --> 01:05:36.070
Same reason you wanna hang around
those stuffy, old white guys.

01:05:36.612 --> 01:05:37.613
Power.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.281
Connections.

01:05:39.823 --> 01:05:40.950
But let's keep it real.

01:05:41.617 --> 01:05:43.827
I'm just a cool, mellow fellow,

01:05:44.453 --> 01:05:46.455
just shucking and jiving,

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:50.501
crip-walking, basketball-playing,
singing and dancing

01:05:50.584 --> 01:05:53.087
and taking out your garbage.

01:05:54.213 --> 01:05:57.007
That's what I am to you.

01:05:58.258 --> 01:05:59.635
You're right.

01:05:59.927 --> 01:06:04.056
You are African-American.

01:06:04.223 --> 01:06:07.977
And myself and my friends,
for the most part,

01:06:08.227 --> 01:06:12.773
don't care for the company
of African-Americans.

01:06:13.399 --> 01:06:17.027
Quite frankly, we're entertained by you.

01:06:17.403 --> 01:06:21.573
We're thrilled by your high-flying acrobatics
on the basketball court,

01:06:21.949 --> 01:06:24.994
that wonderful sense of rhythm you have,

01:06:25.077 --> 01:06:27.871
your animal athleticism.

01:06:28.163 --> 01:06:29.623
But apart from that,

01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:32.668
we have no use for you.

01:06:33.377 --> 01:06:34.712
Understand?

01:06:38.132 --> 01:06:40.301
I mean, let's face it, James.

01:06:40.718 --> 01:06:45.639
Do you set a place at your dinner table
for your pit bulls?

01:06:47.224 --> 01:06:50.227
Now, is this keeping it real enough for you?

01:06:52.521 --> 01:06:56.984
I have another theory on this subject matter
and it goes something like this.

01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:59.194
I imagine several hundred years ago,

01:06:59.236 --> 01:07:02.573
a group of very powerful men,
not unlike yourself,

01:07:02.656 --> 01:07:05.117
were out conquering the known world.

01:07:05.659 --> 01:07:07.328
So they get to Africa,

01:07:07.411 --> 01:07:08.746
feeling pretty good about themselves,

01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:13.792
definitely feeling superior to the savages
they see running in the jungle.

01:07:14.668 --> 01:07:18.964
That is, until one of the brothers
drops his loincloth.

01:07:21.008 --> 01:07:24.178
And then these powerful men
all of a sudden

01:07:24.678 --> 01:07:27.181
come face to face, so to speak,

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.351
with one of life's great inequities.

01:07:31.935 --> 01:07:36.357
Let's whip them out and I'll settle
that myth right here and now.

01:07:37.024 --> 01:07:38.359
Let's go.

01:07:42.237 --> 01:07:43.781
Okay, my friend.

01:07:44.406 --> 01:07:47.242
I'll stick my neck out and vouch for you.

01:07:48.494 --> 01:07:51.538
But if you let me down in front of my people,

01:07:52.706 --> 01:07:56.961
life will become very lonely for you
out there on those streets.

01:07:59.296 --> 01:08:00.631
Am I clear?

01:08:02.633 --> 01:08:04.051
Clear as water.

01:08:06.136 --> 01:08:10.182
I'm hosting a retreat for Consortium
members over the next three days.

01:08:10.265 --> 01:08:12.559
Have your man ready in two.

01:08:14.228 --> 01:08:15.813
He'll be ready.

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:28.951
Wait.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.245
I know this man.

01:08:31.328 --> 01:08:32.830
You know him?

01:08:33.706 --> 01:08:35.541
His name is Roberto.

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:38.794
He liked to help kids.

01:08:52.182 --> 01:08:54.059
You hear about Roberto?

01:08:57.813 --> 01:09:00.733
Yeah. I saw him.

01:09:03.444 --> 01:09:06.613
They put the dogs
on that poor, sweet old man.

01:09:09.116 --> 01:09:10.826
Put the dogs on him.

01:09:12.661 --> 01:09:16.122
Chewed him up like a piece of meat.

01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:25.256
I just don't...

01:09:27.468 --> 01:09:30.179
I don't understand this place anymore.

01:09:32.598 --> 01:09:33.807
I don't.

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:36.852
I'm just saddened.

01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:43.233
It'll get better.

01:09:58.332 --> 01:10:01.043
Mr. Bone, someone's here to see you.

01:10:05.214 --> 01:10:07.049
Come on, baby, let's go.

01:10:11.095 --> 01:10:12.388
Cute kid.

01:10:13.472 --> 01:10:15.474
Always wanted one of my own.

01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:20.187
I gotta call you pimp of the year, player.

01:10:20.688 --> 01:10:23.107
I give you my best girl two days ago.

01:10:23.190 --> 01:10:27.069
I turn around,
find you putting it to the nanny.

01:10:28.487 --> 01:10:30.281
What are you doing here?

01:10:31.865 --> 01:10:33.534
It's on, brother.

01:10:34.034 --> 01:10:36.412
It is on.

01:10:38.247 --> 01:10:39.748
What is on?

01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:43.961
The fight between you and Price.

01:10:46.755 --> 01:10:49.216
You put the money up for the fight?

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.010
Five million dollars.

01:10:52.177 --> 01:10:54.471
But I never said I would fight.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.432
Excuse me?

01:10:57.016 --> 01:10:59.184
I told you I'd think about it.

01:10:59.893 --> 01:11:01.520
I thought about it.

01:11:01.937 --> 01:11:03.606
Decided not to fight.

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:09.153
Man, are you out of your fucking mind?

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:13.115
Five million dollars.

01:11:14.867 --> 01:11:17.745
- Get it back.
- Get it back. Get it back.

01:11:18.287 --> 01:11:19.705
Do you know

01:11:20.789 --> 01:11:24.084
how much shit you are getting me in?

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:30.007
You're smarter than that.

01:11:31.216 --> 01:11:34.553
You are in that fight.

01:11:36.597 --> 01:11:38.349
Yes, motherfucker.

01:11:39.266 --> 01:11:40.976
You are in that fight

01:11:42.061 --> 01:11:43.979
or somebody's gonna be dead.

01:11:49.485 --> 01:11:50.444
You're right.

01:11:51.362 --> 01:11:52.488
Somebody might be.

01:11:53.989 --> 01:11:55.074
No.

01:11:55.366 --> 01:11:57.826
Ease the fuck back there, motherfucker.

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:47.126
Look. Listen.

01:12:48.335 --> 01:12:51.297
I want you to take this money,
take the kids and check into a hotel.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:55.217
Stay there till you hear from me.
It's too dangerous for you now.

01:12:56.176 --> 01:12:57.344
I will.

01:12:58.679 --> 01:13:01.390
But when I come back, I want you gone.

01:13:09.815 --> 01:13:11.483
Rustle up the crew now.

01:13:12.359 --> 01:13:13.986
I want every motherfucker with a gun

01:13:14.069 --> 01:13:17.489
locked, loaded and ready to regulate
in fifteen minutes.

01:13:17.531 --> 01:13:20.743
Get Bone, get Pinball, that bitch,

01:13:21.076 --> 01:13:24.955
the nanny, all of them motherfuckers!

01:13:41.013 --> 01:13:44.558
You smell like watermelon bubblegum.

01:13:47.353 --> 01:13:49.605
Where that motherfucker, Bone?

01:13:54.276 --> 01:13:56.236
Well, the last time I saw him,

01:13:56.278 --> 01:14:00.407
I believe he was at your mother's house with
a box of condoms and a bucket of chicken.

01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:03.369
He got jokes.

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:11.794
You done did it now.
Don't you know I'm from Pittsburgh?

01:14:11.835 --> 01:14:13.504
We don't play that shit!

01:14:13.545 --> 01:14:14.672
No!

01:14:16.882 --> 01:14:19.176
I said, where that nigga, Bone?

01:14:20.594 --> 01:14:22.221
Where that nigga...

01:14:24.098 --> 01:14:25.724
- ... Bone?
- Hold on, slick.

01:14:25.766 --> 01:14:29.353
Where that nigga, Bone?
Where that nigga, Bone?

01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:33.774
Where that nigga, Bone?

01:14:33.816 --> 01:14:36.110
I said, where that nigga, Bone?

01:14:36.902 --> 01:14:38.904
Where that nigga, Bone?

01:14:53.627 --> 01:14:56.630
Man, B, you're really good with that gun
as you are with your fists.

01:14:56.714 --> 01:14:58.382
You gonna tell me
what the hell's going on around here?

01:14:58.424 --> 01:15:00.968
You wanna talk about it here
or down at the police station?

01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:02.469
Yeah, let's talk about that later.

01:15:02.553 --> 01:15:05.431
But help me get this side of beef off of me.

01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:09.727
James.

01:15:09.810 --> 01:15:12.187
Homegirl says she got the 411 on Angela.

01:15:12.605 --> 01:15:15.232
Yeah, I seen that girl y'all was
talking about at the Intersection.

01:15:15.357 --> 01:15:17.860
- What intersection?
- No, man the Intersection,

01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:21.864
back where the judge sent me to get clean.
She in there.

01:15:21.947 --> 01:15:23.741
That girl, she in there.

01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:35.961
Seven.

01:15:51.435 --> 01:15:52.603
Angela.

01:15:55.481 --> 01:15:56.941
Angela, come on, get up.

01:15:57.024 --> 01:15:58.567
What's up, bitches?

01:15:58.609 --> 01:15:59.944
The fuck you gonna do?

01:16:00.569 --> 01:16:04.156
Don't move. 'Cause I'd love
to bust a cap in one of your asses.

01:16:17.378 --> 01:16:18.712
Get their cell phones.

01:16:30.265 --> 01:16:33.644
- You got that bitch yet?
- Yeah, I've got her

01:16:36.272 --> 01:16:38.524
- Bone?
- Now I'm coming for you

01:16:42.736 --> 01:16:44.071
Fuck.

01:17:02.131 --> 01:17:03.799
Okay, motherfucker.

01:17:06.135 --> 01:17:07.845
Okay, motherfucker.

01:17:10.556 --> 01:17:12.891
- What's up?
- You wanna play games?

01:17:12.975 --> 01:17:15.936
Time to play
follow the motherfucking leader.

01:17:21.317 --> 01:17:23.444
Shit. He wants us to follow him.

01:17:23.527 --> 01:17:24.987
And I think I know where.

01:17:29.199 --> 01:17:31.702
Yeah, Franklin. James.

01:17:31.827 --> 01:17:34.872
That fight, it has to happen tonight.

01:18:32.554 --> 01:18:34.181
Good evening, sir.

01:18:34.264 --> 01:18:35.975
This way, if you will.

01:18:49.238 --> 01:18:52.157
Mr. Bone, it's good of you to join us.

01:18:53.158 --> 01:18:56.745
Like I said, family, you are gonna fight.

01:18:57.746 --> 01:19:00.374
And you are gonna win me back my money.

01:19:01.959 --> 01:19:03.919
And if I don't fight?

01:19:03.961 --> 01:19:05.754
Then you'll die.

01:19:07.756 --> 01:19:10.592
And I'll go back to town
and I'll kill the nanny

01:19:10.676 --> 01:19:14.555
and the three little brats
and your little rat, Pinball.

01:19:15.723 --> 01:19:17.474
And this will hurt.

01:19:17.558 --> 01:19:20.644
But I'll gut and filet Angela like a sea bass.

01:19:21.353 --> 01:19:23.147
Just like you killed Roberto.

01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:26.650
That stupid old man opened his mouth
one time too many.

01:19:26.734 --> 01:19:30.863
And you killed my friend Danny in prison,
set him up for a murder he didn't commit.

01:19:30.988 --> 01:19:32.531
You knew Danny?

01:19:33.616 --> 01:19:35.951
So that's what this is about.

01:19:36.785 --> 01:19:38.370
Danny and Angela.

01:19:39.246 --> 01:19:41.915
He was a stupid-ass boy.

01:19:42.791 --> 01:19:44.835
He didn't deserve Angela.

01:19:46.503 --> 01:19:48.714
Well, I guess right about now
you'll be getting the picture

01:19:48.797 --> 01:19:50.883
about how the fuck we roll.

01:19:50.966 --> 01:19:53.969
James, you talk too much.

01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:56.430
Yes, you do.

01:20:00.517 --> 01:20:04.647
I wanna report a possible homicide,
4215 Westgate Terrace.

01:20:05.064 --> 01:20:07.858
Yeah, I'm about to send you a video.
All right.

01:20:14.031 --> 01:20:16.700
So, you're ready to fight, Mr. Bone?

01:20:17.618 --> 01:20:19.161
And if I don't?

01:20:20.204 --> 01:20:22.498
Then I'll beat you where you stand.

01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:24.166
Need I say more?

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.585
Do you want to change?

01:20:28.087 --> 01:20:29.380
For what?

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.915
Not bad.

01:23:57.463 --> 01:23:59.632
Winner by forfeit, Price.

01:24:03.927 --> 01:24:06.055
You motherfucker.

01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:09.808
- James!
- Fuck you, too.

01:24:27.868 --> 01:24:29.036
O'Hara.

01:25:38.856 --> 01:25:41.066
- I'll see you later.
- Nobody move!

01:25:41.108 --> 01:25:42.401
L.A.P.D.

01:25:42.484 --> 01:25:45.070
L.A.P.D.! Everybody, stay where you are!

01:25:47.281 --> 01:25:51.201
If I go down, you go down, too.

01:25:52.036 --> 01:25:53.370
We'll see.

01:25:56.624 --> 01:25:59.335
Hey, Bone, when I get out,

01:25:59.627 --> 01:26:01.879
you got family on the outside.

01:26:03.339 --> 01:26:05.382
Believe that, big homie.

01:26:06.842 --> 01:26:08.218
Believe that.

01:26:30.115 --> 01:26:32.117
Wanna go see your mommy?

01:26:35.204 --> 01:26:36.580
Go, baby.

01:26:52.304 --> 01:26:54.431
Never gonna leave you again.

01:26:57.643 --> 01:26:58.936
Never again.

01:27:11.073 --> 01:27:15.411
I know I said you had to leave,
but you can stay if you like.

01:27:18.122 --> 01:27:23.002
No, you were... You were right. I'm trouble.

01:27:24.503 --> 01:27:28.590
You knew that boy was here the whole time,
didn't you?

01:27:30.342 --> 01:27:32.303
And who his mother was

01:27:32.928 --> 01:27:36.223
long before you ever came
and knocked on my door.

01:27:39.351 --> 01:27:43.063
I've got some money in this envelope
for you.

01:27:44.106 --> 01:27:45.858
Nobody's looking for it.

01:27:47.901 --> 01:27:52.656
I'd like Angela to stay here with Jared
after she gets cleaned up.

01:27:52.698 --> 01:27:55.409
- That's if it's all right with you.
- It's all right.

01:27:59.538 --> 01:28:03.208
You did all of this
just to keep a jailhouse promise?

01:28:04.752 --> 01:28:06.837
I like to keep my promises.

01:28:11.925 --> 01:28:13.385
I gotta go.

01:28:38.285 --> 01:28:39.662
Thank you.

01:28:46.210 --> 01:28:47.836
Give you a lift?

01:28:49.755 --> 01:28:51.090
No.

01:28:51.757 --> 01:28:53.425
I think I'll walk.

01:28:55.469 --> 01:28:58.305
Life in the city keep going, don't it?

01:28:58.347 --> 01:28:59.682
Oh, yeah.

01:28:59.932 --> 01:29:00.933
Sure you don't wanna stick around?

01:29:01.016 --> 01:29:04.770
I could set some fights up.
We could make some real money, man.

01:29:04.812 --> 01:29:08.482
Nope. Got some business to take care of.

01:30:19.845 --> 01:30:21.388
Sit on my shank,
motherfucker.
