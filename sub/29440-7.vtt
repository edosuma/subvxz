WEBVTT

00:04.008 --> 00:05.637
Jerome?
‐ Hey, beautiful.

00:05.637 --> 00:07.223
Jerome is out?

00:07.223 --> 00:08.851
‐ Showed up on my doorstep
like a lost puppy.

00:08.851 --> 00:10.813
But Randy's happy
to see his daddy.

00:10.813 --> 00:12.692
There's a tiny
little sliver of land

00:12.692 --> 00:15.239
in Ohio that I've been
sittin' on for years.

00:15.239 --> 00:16.784
You won't be laughin'
when I put you

00:16.784 --> 00:18.495
in that dream house
you always wanted.

00:18.495 --> 00:19.873
‐ For real?

00:19.873 --> 00:21.835
‐ As real as I'm sittin' here
right now.

00:21.835 --> 00:22.921
‐ Afternoon, sweetheart.

00:22.921 --> 00:25.342
‐ Have a fine day.

00:25.342 --> 00:27.471
Jerome,
did you pay them?

00:27.471 --> 00:28.683
‐ I'm not gonna move
another inch

00:28.683 --> 00:31.187
until I hear you say
you trust me.

00:31.187 --> 00:32.941
Damn Jerome.
Comin' in here

00:32.941 --> 00:34.485
like we supposed to
bow down to him.

00:34.485 --> 00:36.991
When you get out
of jail, you feel like

00:36.991 --> 00:38.661
the entire world
has moved on without you,

00:38.661 --> 00:40.414
and all you're trying to do
is catch up with it.

00:40.414 --> 00:42.334
You all need to use
this time to go out there

00:42.334 --> 00:43.588
and look for a job.

00:43.588 --> 00:46.217
Hit it hard.
Really pound the pavement.

00:49.015 --> 00:50.350
‐ Damn, son,
you murderin' that.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.271
‐ Yo.
You hear that?

00:52.271 --> 00:53.858
Yeah, the hood
is feelin' it.

00:53.858 --> 00:55.528
Shit.

00:55.528 --> 00:57.323
You think you gonna
be a star and all that,

00:57.323 --> 00:59.035
so you out here
wastin' your fuckin' time

00:59.035 --> 01:00.788
rhymin' on some Memorex.

01:00.788 --> 01:02.917
‐ The assistant to this manager
gave me his number.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.045
‐ Manager?
Nigga, whatever.

01:04.045 --> 01:05.882
My shit had
all the birds chirpin'.

01:05.882 --> 01:07.677
My brothers is always
gonna be my brothers.

01:07.677 --> 01:10.892
And all that falling on me,
I don't want that for you.

01:10.892 --> 01:11.977
‐ I'm tired
of everybody thinking

01:11.977 --> 01:13.355
that they know
what's best for me.

01:13.355 --> 01:14.482
I know what I want.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.406
‐ Turn that shit off.

01:18.406 --> 01:21.496
‐ Fuck you, you corny‐ass,
wannabe‐bad Uncle Tom.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.377
Yo!
Yo, yo!

01:26.047 --> 01:28.259
‐ He can't breathe!
‐ Yo, let him up!

01:28.259 --> 01:29.846
Say something!

01:29.846 --> 01:30.932
Say something!

01:30.932 --> 01:32.267
Fucking dead.
You killed him!

01:32.267 --> 01:33.813
He's not moving!

02:13.559 --> 02:14.895

02:14.895 --> 02:17.274
‐ You cleaned your plate,
didn't you?

02:19.821 --> 02:20.823
‐ Late again, huh?

02:20.823 --> 02:23.203
‐ Man, fuck you.

02:25.917 --> 02:27.921
‐ Maybe you can go home
and get some dinner.

02:27.921 --> 02:32.179
You know, instead of
freeloadin' off your relatives.

02:32.179 --> 02:34.475
Clean up after yourself.

02:37.231 --> 02:38.609
‐ Mama!

02:38.609 --> 02:40.822
Hey, put him on his ass!
Put him on his ass!

02:42.700 --> 02:44.495
‐ Hey, hey, hey!

Get off my son!

02:47.042 --> 02:48.378
Stop it!
Get off!

03:04.870 --> 03:06.748

Yo!

Yo, ref!
Yo, ref, hey!

03:10.882 --> 03:12.760
‐ You just need to play.
Hey, you better calm down.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.888
‐ Yo, I know
you seen that shit!

03:13.888 --> 03:14.973
What you mean, calm down?

03:14.973 --> 03:16.768
‐ One minute penalty.
Go sit down.

03:16.768 --> 03:18.522
‐ That ain't no penalty!

03:18.522 --> 03:20.025
Auntie,
you don't understand, he was‐‐

03:20.025 --> 03:22.112
‐ Get out of my house.
‐ Where am I supposed to go?

03:22.112 --> 03:23.448
I don't care.

03:23.448 --> 03:25.536
Get your shit, and get out.

03:25.536 --> 03:27.456
Now.

03:27.456 --> 03:29.126
If you're lucky,
maybe your grandma

03:29.126 --> 03:30.546
will take you back.

03:30.546 --> 03:32.717
‐ Yo, that's bullshit, ref!

03:37.392 --> 03:39.063
‐ Hey, yo, keep your head up,
man, we got you.

03:39.063 --> 03:41.526
We know that dude stuck you,
Shotgun, fuck that ref.

03:56.973 --> 03:58.393
Hey, Grandma.

04:00.355 --> 04:03.236
Please just give me
one more chance.

04:28.704 --> 04:30.958
‐ That was a fucking penalty.

06:10.448 --> 06:13.162
‐ Hey.
Look who's here.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.838
Uncle Anthony.

06:17.838 --> 06:22.013
‐ Man, you must've grown
a whole damn f‐‐

06:22.013 --> 06:23.474
a whole foot‐‐

06:23.474 --> 06:25.646
since I last saw you.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.274
‐ What you doing here?

06:27.274 --> 06:28.568
‐ Says he's clean.

06:28.568 --> 06:30.196
‐ It's 'cause
it's the truth, Ma.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.870
Anyway, I‐I'm out on parole.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.708
I can't be messing all that up.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.753
They'll throw away
the key on me.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.218
Man, come on, man.

06:41.218 --> 06:43.557
Yeah.

06:47.857 --> 06:50.194
It's gonna be different now.

06:50.194 --> 06:52.115
I got my old job back.

06:52.115 --> 06:53.994
‐ You moving here?

06:53.994 --> 06:54.996
With us?

06:54.996 --> 06:55.998
Yeah.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.710
What you think about that?

06:57.710 --> 07:01.885
‐ That mean you gonna be
paying rent this time, Anthony?

07:01.885 --> 07:04.222
‐

07:04.222 --> 07:06.060
Yeah, Ma.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.479
Something like that.

07:16.831 --> 07:18.710
‐ Divine.
‐ Yeah?

07:18.710 --> 07:20.213
‐ Why don't you help me out
with this rug.

07:20.213 --> 07:22.050
‐ Yeah.

07:25.808 --> 07:29.064
‐ Hey, yo, I heard
what happened to your boy Haze.

07:29.064 --> 07:31.110
That shit's fucked up.

07:31.110 --> 07:33.615
Cops be buggin' out, son.

07:43.677 --> 07:45.429
Hey, yo, Bob.

07:45.429 --> 07:46.473
‐ Hey, yo.

07:46.473 --> 07:47.475
‐ Hey, man.

07:47.475 --> 07:48.477
Yo, you moving?

07:48.477 --> 07:49.772
‐ Just packing up shit
for Ohio.

07:49.772 --> 07:50.816
‐ Hey, honey.

07:50.816 --> 07:53.279
You here to help us out?

07:53.279 --> 07:55.032
‐ No, Ma.

07:55.032 --> 07:56.326
His ankle is busted.

07:56.326 --> 07:58.038
‐ Oh.
Okay.

07:58.038 --> 07:59.959
Well, help us pack up
the kitchen, then, Shotgun.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.086
Thank you.

08:07.098 --> 08:08.977
Shurrie,
stop dragging your feet.

08:08.977 --> 08:10.981
Anything left in your room
by the time Jerome finished

08:10.981 --> 08:12.860
packing the truck,
it ain't coming.

08:14.404 --> 08:15.741
‐ Then I'm staying in my room.

08:15.741 --> 08:17.995
‐ Excuse me, girl,
who you think you are?

08:17.995 --> 08:18.997
Are you crazy?

08:18.997 --> 08:21.376
‐ Hey.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.673
Come on, now, little lady,
show your mama some respect.

08:23.673 --> 08:24.967
‐ No, leave it.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.386
We got seven hours
in the car together

08:26.386 --> 08:28.182
to enjoy her little tantrum.

08:32.775 --> 08:35.363
‐ Come on.
Mom said we gotta hurry.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.328
‐ How come you don't want
to move so much?

08:42.210 --> 08:43.712
‐ I don't know.

08:43.712 --> 08:45.509
‐ Is it 'cause I'm going?

08:47.053 --> 08:49.767
‐ What?

08:49.767 --> 08:51.228
‐ Do you want to stay here

08:51.228 --> 08:54.527
so you don't have to
take care of me anymore?

08:54.527 --> 08:57.031
I know you probably
get sick of me sometimes.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.876
‐ Come here.

09:06.801 --> 09:08.972
No, okay?

09:08.972 --> 09:11.936
I'm not sick of you.

09:11.936 --> 09:13.773
Don't say things like that.
I'm sorry.

09:13.773 --> 09:15.443
Come here.

09:23.292 --> 09:25.463
Hey, Randy?

09:25.463 --> 09:27.968
Can you do me a big favor?

09:27.968 --> 09:29.930
Can you, um,

09:29.930 --> 09:32.477
take this box down
to the truck?

09:32.477 --> 09:33.813
‐ Okay.

09:44.669 --> 09:47.675
Shurrie, this box
too heavy for me.

09:47.675 --> 09:49.762
Can‐‐oh, can you take it?

09:51.431 --> 09:53.978
‐ Yeah, yeah,
I got you, little man.

10:31.094 --> 10:32.514
‐ You're a real pro
at this, huh?

10:32.514 --> 10:33.892
‐

10:33.892 --> 10:35.604
‐ You move around a lot
or something?

10:35.604 --> 10:37.524
‐ Nah.

10:37.524 --> 10:39.570
First time out of the joint,
I was a mover.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.406
It was the only job
I could get, you know?

10:41.406 --> 10:44.204
So I just kept my head down,
handled business.

10:44.204 --> 10:46.416
Worked out all right
in the end.

10:46.416 --> 10:50.216
Handle yours, it'll work out
for you too.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.554
You don't want to end up
like your boy Haze.

10:56.061 --> 11:01.112
‐ Matter of fact, I got a‐‐
I got a job interview tomorrow.

11:01.112 --> 11:03.075
‐ You know
who you meetin' with?

11:03.075 --> 11:05.580
‐ Yeah, uh, somebody
at this cleaning company

11:05.580 --> 11:06.874
up at the World Trade.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.252
‐ I done a ton
of interviews like that

11:08.252 --> 11:10.924
when I was fresh out the joint.

11:10.924 --> 11:13.387
Gotta read the person.

11:13.387 --> 11:15.015
'Cause they looking
for any excuse

11:15.015 --> 11:17.311
not to trust you.

11:17.311 --> 11:20.652
If it's a white woman,
appeal to her sympathy.

11:20.652 --> 11:22.029
If it's a white man,
you ain't gonna get that,

11:22.029 --> 11:23.950
so be "respectful."

11:23.950 --> 11:27.624
If it's a brother,
be straight up with him.

11:27.624 --> 11:28.835
Oh.

11:28.835 --> 11:31.006
Pardon me, fellas.

11:31.006 --> 11:34.220
There's a damsel in distress.

11:34.220 --> 11:35.640
Give that to me.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.393
Let me get it.

11:44.617 --> 11:47.623
‐ Yo, what do you think?

11:47.623 --> 11:49.585
‐ Well, he says he loves her.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.674
And, you know, Randy's getting
a chance to be with his dad.

11:52.674 --> 11:54.010
‐ Yeah.

11:56.056 --> 11:57.517
Damn.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.314
Yo, I can't believe
this is happening for real.

12:04.615 --> 12:07.244
‐ All right, yo,
I'm gonna go piss.

12:15.595 --> 12:18.100
‐ Yo, I‐I got this.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.563
‐ Damn, son, I been looking

12:22.400 --> 12:24.863
‐ Hey, you packed the fuck
out of this box, nigga.

12:26.993 --> 12:29.748
‐ My uncle told me
how to cross‐tape.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.796
I didn't want your mother's
dishes getting broke.

12:32.796 --> 12:35.927
Jostling on that journey.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.764
She got some nice shit, son.

12:41.564 --> 12:43.860
Yo, you really out?
No, I just, uh‐‐

12:43.860 --> 12:47.868

12:47.868 --> 12:49.997
‐ Oh, so you staying.

12:49.997 --> 12:50.999
‐ Yeah.

12:52.293 --> 12:55.340
About to have

12:55.340 --> 12:58.681
When 'Vine get back,

12:58.681 --> 13:00.350
This 'bout to be the new hang.

13:00.350 --> 13:04.317
Gon' have everything.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.820

13:09.578 --> 13:12.416
‐ Well, uh, bye, D.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.797
‐ Yeah.
Have fun in Ohio.

13:18.971 --> 13:21.602
‐ You better look out
for each other.

13:25.234 --> 13:26.946
You too, Dennis.

13:26.946 --> 13:29.075
‐ Yes, ma'am.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.410
‐ Yeah, Mommy.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.331
Yeah, of course.

13:32.331 --> 13:35.212
‐ Yeah, don't you worry.

13:35.212 --> 13:36.757
You're not leaving us alone.

13:36.757 --> 13:37.843
We'll look out for each other.

13:37.843 --> 13:39.053
‐ Yeah, and it ain't like

13:39.053 --> 13:40.472
we're not gonna be talkin'
to each other

13:40.472 --> 13:41.725
or seein' one another.

13:41.725 --> 13:43.311
‐ No, but it's different.

13:45.148 --> 13:47.111
You're men now.

13:50.158 --> 13:51.327
All of you.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.381
Can't just be having parties
all the time while I'm gone.

13:57.381 --> 14:01.347
You have to make something
of yourself.

14:01.347 --> 14:05.480
You can always make
something of yourselves.

14:07.944 --> 14:10.115
No matter what anybody says.

14:13.038 --> 14:15.585
You hear me?

14:25.312 --> 14:26.523
I love you.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.125
All right.

15:12.197 --> 15:13.826
I'm
a really hard worker.

15:13.826 --> 15:15.370
Always on time.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.588
Hey, and I really need
this job.

15:19.588 --> 15:21.257
Yeah, no kidding.

15:24.013 --> 15:26.184
I see you came
from the jobs program.

15:29.023 --> 15:30.777
We keep a tight ship over here.

15:30.777 --> 15:34.200
You gotta show up on time,
do what you're told.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.997
Always wear your uniform
and keep it clean.

15:39.753 --> 15:41.924
‐ This sounds like
a great opportunity.

15:57.872 --> 16:00.335
Hmm.
What you think of this one?

16:00.335 --> 16:03.341
Yo, that's the color
for you, girl.

16:03.341 --> 16:07.474
Hey, what you got for us
by way of associate discount?

16:07.474 --> 16:10.188
‐ I only have
a client discount, man.

16:10.188 --> 16:11.817
You can talk to Vickie.

16:11.817 --> 16:13.612
I think I see
my 2:00 walking in.

16:13.612 --> 16:15.365
Take your time.

16:15.365 --> 16:18.079
‐ Yo, that's Big Daddy Kane
and Roxanne Shanté?

16:18.079 --> 16:19.833
‐ Mm‐hmm.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.127
Come on.

16:21.127 --> 16:23.131
‐ Yo.

16:23.131 --> 16:25.511
‐ Have a seat.

16:25.511 --> 16:27.389
‐ Oh, your office in here too?

16:27.389 --> 16:29.476
‐ The fur business
and the music business,

16:29.476 --> 16:31.607
good to be in together.

16:31.607 --> 16:33.443
Help people in both parties.

16:33.443 --> 16:36.658
Stick around, there might be
a coat in here for you.

16:36.658 --> 16:37.827
‐ Word?

16:37.827 --> 16:40.373
‐ I really dug
the demo you sent me.

16:40.373 --> 16:42.962
Not every day I get a tape
labeled "Genius" on it.

16:42.962 --> 16:44.256
‐ Well, you know,
name found me.

16:44.256 --> 16:45.718
Know what I'm sayin'?

16:45.718 --> 16:47.722
‐ I've been putting in calls
about you all over town.

16:49.559 --> 16:51.605
‐ Yo, I really appreciate that.

16:51.605 --> 16:53.943
‐ How about your‐‐
your boy on your track?

16:53.943 --> 16:55.195
You said he was your cousin?

16:55.195 --> 16:56.823
‐ Oh, yeah, Bobby.

16:56.823 --> 16:57.825
Dynamite.

16:59.704 --> 17:02.376
Just got his demo with me.

17:02.376 --> 17:03.754
Check it out.

17:05.590 --> 17:09.306
No, he's got a... unique sound.

17:37.154 --> 17:40.118
‐ Yo.
‐ Yo, what up, son?

17:43.959 --> 17:46.297
Hey, yo, how'd that job
interview go and shit?

17:46.297 --> 17:49.512
‐ A'ight, I guess.

17:54.522 --> 17:57.027
Yo, where Bobby at?

17:57.027 --> 17:59.699
‐ I ain't seen him
since I left your house.

17:59.699 --> 18:02.245
I wish he'd come soon, though.

18:02.245 --> 18:03.666
But that chess‐playin' nigga
keep tryin'

18:03.666 --> 18:06.003
to get me to sit down
and shit, like...

18:06.003 --> 18:08.967
I don't know that nigga,
the fuck?

18:14.061 --> 18:16.858
Hey, yo, you spoke
to your family yet?

18:16.858 --> 18:19.948
‐ Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:19.948 --> 18:21.117
‐ Cool.

18:23.454 --> 18:25.543
I wonder how they liking it.

18:25.543 --> 18:26.670
Ohio.

18:31.972 --> 18:34.184
So Shurrie, is she, like,
finishing high school and shit

18:34.184 --> 18:35.186
out there or...

18:35.186 --> 18:36.565
‐ Yo, I'll catch you later.

18:36.565 --> 18:38.401
‐ Hey, yo, what...

18:48.714 --> 18:50.425
Hey, yo.

18:52.095 --> 18:55.310
Hey, man, I just got done
talking to my cousin.

18:55.310 --> 18:58.274
He just played my demo
for this manager,

18:58.274 --> 18:59.736
and he wants to meet.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.704
‐ That's dope, son.

19:04.704 --> 19:07.835
He gon' sign you for sure.

19:07.835 --> 19:09.506
‐ Hey, yo.

19:09.506 --> 19:10.841
Hey, listen.

19:10.841 --> 19:13.722
He heard your verses too, man.

19:13.722 --> 19:16.352
He wants to meet us both.

19:16.352 --> 19:18.022
Tonight.

19:26.163 --> 19:31.967
Yo, I bet Haze would, uh...
yo, Haze would be excited, yo.

19:34.388 --> 19:36.267
He always believed in you.

19:38.772 --> 19:40.693
It's a big opportunity.

19:42.530 --> 19:45.410
‐ He's playing
in the championships.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.832
It's the first time
in his school's history.

19:47.832 --> 19:50.880
It's a big opportunity.

19:50.880 --> 19:56.348
I, um, I got a call
from your mama today.

19:56.348 --> 19:57.810
‐ Oh, really?

19:57.810 --> 19:59.772
She okay?

19:59.772 --> 20:04.448
‐ She's got a place
in Staten Island now.

20:04.448 --> 20:07.245
She wants you
to come live with her.

20:07.245 --> 20:09.499
Oh.

20:09.499 --> 20:13.759
‐ You still got time to pack
and catch the train tonight.

20:13.759 --> 20:17.808
‐ Mama, as much as Shotgun
wants to be back with her,

20:17.808 --> 20:19.394
I think it's best
that he finish up

20:19.394 --> 20:22.985
the lacrosse season
and school year here.

20:22.985 --> 20:25.532
He's playing
in the championships.

20:25.532 --> 20:27.369
It's the first time
in his school's history.

20:27.369 --> 20:29.498
He's playing against
all of these white boys.

20:29.498 --> 20:32.003
It's a big opportunity.

20:32.003 --> 20:33.381
‐ Fine.

20:33.381 --> 20:36.136
Let's at least give her a call.

20:36.136 --> 20:37.890
After dinner.

20:48.787 --> 20:51.584
Almighty God, we thank You
for this time together,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.212
and we pray now
that You will bless it

20:53.212 --> 20:55.049
to the nourishment
of our lives.

20:55.049 --> 20:56.427
In the name of Jesus, we pray.

21:15.256 --> 21:16.509
And when I heard
that verse

21:16.509 --> 21:18.889
about the sperm
that fertilized the egg?

21:18.889 --> 21:21.435
Whoo!
Wait, wait. Yo, yo.

21:21.435 --> 21:23.022
Y'all liked that?
Come on.

21:23.022 --> 21:25.778
I never heard a verse
like that before in my life!

21:25.778 --> 21:28.407
‐ Shit sure wasn't no biter.

21:28.407 --> 21:30.704
‐ And I was very impressed
by your track.

21:30.704 --> 21:32.123
I mean,
you could feel the energy

21:32.123 --> 21:34.504
coming through the speakers.

21:34.504 --> 21:36.381
‐ Yo, I appreciate that.

21:36.381 --> 21:38.094
‐ Yeah.
Word.

21:38.094 --> 21:39.387
‐ Gary.

21:39.387 --> 21:42.102
Let me introduce you to Fly Ty.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.437
Look, when I get back,
we talk next steps.

21:43.437 --> 21:45.316
We got a showcase
here tomorrow night.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.530
‐ Yo, cuz.

21:47.530 --> 21:49.826
‐ Yo.

22:03.435 --> 22:06.651
‐ Hey, I could
get used to this.

22:15.669 --> 22:17.297
We almost there.

22:36.251 --> 22:37.922
‐ Yo, Bobby!

22:40.259 --> 22:44.602
Damn, my moms paged me
12 times, son.

22:44.602 --> 22:46.606
Yo, Bobby,
where the fuck you at, son?

22:52.576 --> 22:53.912
Yo, what's good, nigga?

22:53.912 --> 22:55.331
Shit, man.

22:55.331 --> 22:57.335
‐ Where the fuck you been, son?

22:57.335 --> 23:01.134
You got me fucking taking
trips and shit by mys...

23:09.109 --> 23:10.529
Hey, yo, so let me
get this straight.

23:10.529 --> 23:12.574
You been hanging out
with this Park Hill nigga

23:12.574 --> 23:13.994
instead of puttin' in work
with me?

23:13.994 --> 23:15.539
Hey, yo, what the fuck
is up, son?

23:15.539 --> 23:16.958
‐ Hey, yo, listen.

23:16.958 --> 23:19.337
This manager came up
to me and Shotgun, a'ight?

23:19.337 --> 23:20.882
He wants us to perform
at this showcase

23:20.882 --> 23:22.511
for these execs and shit.

23:22.511 --> 23:25.726
So I figured, I prove myself,

23:25.726 --> 23:27.730
I get this manager to sign me,

23:27.730 --> 23:29.608
and then I pass your tape
to him like Gary did for me.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.238
‐ All right, Bob,
what about the fucking work?

23:32.238 --> 23:35.244
So you get signed,
you miss the fucking big time,

23:35.244 --> 23:37.457
'Vine out here
picking up trash on Wall Street

23:37.457 --> 23:38.918
instead of selling
to these niggas,

23:38.918 --> 23:40.379
and I'm supposed to, what,
do the business for myself?

23:40.379 --> 23:41.381
‐ Nah, man.
‐ Is that it?

23:41.381 --> 23:42.467
‐ That's not what I'm saying.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.722
‐ What the fuck are you saying?

23:44.722 --> 23:47.728
Hey, yo, the only reason I got
this deep in this fucking game

23:47.728 --> 23:50.274
is for your family.

23:50.274 --> 23:52.278
‐ Hey, yo, it's two.

23:52.278 --> 23:54.700
Yo, don't forget that.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.623
Yo, all you gotta do
is sit tight, D.

23:57.623 --> 24:01.839
Hey, for now.
Just for now.

24:01.839 --> 24:03.927
And if I go anywhere,

24:03.927 --> 24:06.641
you comin' with me.

24:06.641 --> 24:08.645
You know that shit.

24:24.718 --> 24:26.346
So I talked to my cousin Gary,

24:26.346 --> 24:28.058
he was saying
that we gotta have our names

24:28.058 --> 24:29.562
when we meet those guys.

24:29.562 --> 24:31.314
Like we have our shit together.

24:31.314 --> 24:32.358
Know what I'm saying?

24:32.358 --> 24:34.154
He's going by "The Genius."

24:34.154 --> 24:37.368
‐ Shit, I already been flipping
between two names, son.

24:37.368 --> 24:41.376
Johnny Blaze and Iron Lung.

24:41.376 --> 24:44.007
And I got this new idea, right?

24:44.007 --> 24:46.303
Hot Nickels.

24:46.303 --> 24:48.892
Word.

24:48.892 --> 24:51.522
‐ I don't know, man.

24:51.522 --> 24:53.693
‐ Nigga Haze used to say
that same shit.

24:56.699 --> 24:58.661
‐ Hey, yo.

24:58.661 --> 25:00.122
'Bout to be good tonight?

25:00.122 --> 25:01.792
‐ Hell, yeah.

25:01.792 --> 25:05.216
What about you,
what you gonna go by?

25:05.216 --> 25:07.846
‐ Well, I want
to have something

25:07.846 --> 25:09.975
with a little force behind it.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.146
You know what I'm sayin'?

25:12.146 --> 25:13.775
‐ Force?

25:13.775 --> 25:16.656
I thought you was gonna go
by Bobby Dynamite.

25:18.910 --> 25:20.454
‐ Hey, yo, check this.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.962
Rakeem.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.262
‐ Rakeem?
What's that?

25:28.262 --> 25:30.224
‐ Yeah. Yo, I heard
some Five Percenters

25:30.224 --> 25:32.563
talking about it in the park.

25:32.563 --> 25:35.860
When I heard that shit,
that‐‐that "Ra,"

25:35.860 --> 25:38.490
I thought, damn,
that shit is powerful.

25:38.490 --> 25:40.035
Rakeem.

25:40.035 --> 25:41.329
Yo, it's original.

25:41.329 --> 25:42.833
‐ Yo, son, how is that original

25:42.833 --> 25:46.716
when you caught it from some
Five Percenters in the park?

25:46.716 --> 25:50.222
‐ Nigga, know what I'm saying.

25:50.222 --> 25:52.435
Hurry
your crippled ass up, bruh.

25:52.435 --> 25:54.063
‐ Whatever, man.

26:12.224 --> 26:14.187
Yo, I ain't seen
this many white people

26:14.187 --> 26:15.815
since I lived in Long Island.

26:36.147 --> 26:38.402
‐ No, no, no, no, no.

26:38.402 --> 26:39.487
Use a rake.

26:39.487 --> 26:41.992
Yeah.
See?

26:41.992 --> 26:44.790
A rake won't splash
as much water over the edge.

26:44.790 --> 26:46.084
All right?

26:46.084 --> 26:49.090
See, you learn a trade,
you'll always have work.

26:49.090 --> 26:52.012
Even after everything
I've been through.

26:52.012 --> 26:55.018
‐ Yeah, you done
with all of that now.

26:55.018 --> 26:56.146
Right?

26:56.146 --> 26:57.733
‐ I ain't going nowhere.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.448
Better get back to work.

27:01.448 --> 27:04.955
‐ Hey, man.
What're you doin'?

27:04.955 --> 27:07.042
‐ I'm just teaching
my nephew something.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.880
‐ Yeah, well, teach him
somewhere else.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.675
All right?
Not on my work site.

27:10.675 --> 27:12.136
‐ Your work site?

27:12.136 --> 27:13.263
‐ What do you think this is?

27:13.263 --> 27:15.350
‐ You better chill out.
Tony.

27:19.025 --> 27:20.068
Jerry.

27:20.068 --> 27:21.530
What's going on?

27:21.530 --> 27:23.074
You said you had
my old job for me.

27:23.074 --> 27:25.037
‐ I said I had a job.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.882
‐ You think that kid
knows better than me?

27:30.882 --> 27:32.218
I've been doing construction

27:32.218 --> 27:34.305
longer than
he's been breathing.

27:36.351 --> 27:37.854
How many years
have I given you?

27:37.854 --> 27:39.858
‐ Yeah, and how many
of those years were you clean?

27:43.699 --> 27:45.160
I'm sorry, Tony.

27:46.622 --> 27:48.208
It's the best I can do.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.184
Hey, Unc.

27:57.184 --> 27:59.523
Put your
motherfuckin' hands together.

27:59.523 --> 28:01.944
Put your motherfuckin'
hands together

28:01.944 --> 28:04.198
for my boy, my nigga,

28:04.198 --> 28:08.331
Shotgun!

28:09.835 --> 28:11.589
Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah!

Let's hear that shit!

28:12.966 --> 28:15.262
Hell, yeah.
Hell, yeah.

28:15.262 --> 28:16.264
Yo.

28:16.264 --> 28:17.266
Hey.

28:17.266 --> 28:20.063
Kill that shit, nigga.

28:20.063 --> 28:22.109

28:22.109 --> 28:23.821
New York, what up?

28:23.821 --> 28:25.282
What up, New York?

28:25.282 --> 28:27.411
Make some motherfucking noise,
New York City, what up?

28:28.998 --> 28:30.585
Yeah.

28:30.585 --> 28:33.006
Yo, hey, yo, DJ,
put my shit on, man.

28:33.006 --> 28:35.177
Whoo!

29:28.826 --> 29:30.621
‐ Time!

29:30.621 --> 29:32.542
‐ Yeah!

29:32.542 --> 29:34.755
We want more of that, boy.

29:36.215 --> 29:37.342
Yo, ref.

29:37.342 --> 29:39.848
Yo, don't make it
10 versus 11 out here.

29:39.848 --> 29:41.267
‐ Yeah, you're lucky
I don't call personal.

29:41.267 --> 29:43.104
‐ Yo, ref!

29:43.104 --> 29:44.273
What the fuck was that, man?

29:44.273 --> 29:45.693
‐ Uncle Anthony?

29:45.693 --> 29:47.781
You just gonna let him
lead his whole crew?

29:47.781 --> 29:49.283
‐ Yo, what you doing?
‐ Huh?

29:49.283 --> 29:50.452
‐ Sir, get off the field.

29:50.452 --> 29:51.789
‐ Hey, don't you tell me

29:51.789 --> 29:52.791
get off the field, man.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.210
You get me off the field.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.295
Yo, chill, man.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.882
Yo, you on parole, man.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.928
‐ The hell is your uncle on?

29:58.928 --> 30:00.096
‐ He's trying to cheat you.

30:00.096 --> 30:01.975
‐ Yo, Uncle Anthony, please.
Stop, man.

30:01.975 --> 30:03.353
‐

30:03.353 --> 30:05.023
‐ Get your uncle off the field.

30:06.777 --> 30:08.154
‐ No.
No, no, no.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.325
Please.
I'll get him out of here.

30:11.995 --> 30:13.707
‐ He's trying to cheat you.

30:13.707 --> 30:15.503
‐ Come on, man.
Get up.

30:15.503 --> 30:17.464
Come on, man, we gotta go.
We gotta go, come on.

30:17.464 --> 30:18.801
‐ Cheat you.
Shotgun, man!

30:18.801 --> 30:20.888
Where you going?
It's the championship game!

30:34.123 --> 30:36.335
‐ Hey, yo,
you fucking killed it.

30:44.811 --> 30:46.147
‐ Oh.

30:48.986 --> 30:50.698
Oh, shit.

30:54.831 --> 30:56.334
‐ Catch you later, man.

30:58.171 --> 30:59.841
‐ Yo.

30:59.841 --> 31:01.177
Yo, n‐n...

31:04.893 --> 31:06.939
Fuckin'...

31:09.109 --> 31:11.782
Shit.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.495
Shotgun.

31:35.495 --> 31:36.540
Patrick Nelson.

31:36.540 --> 31:37.542
Varsity Records.

31:37.542 --> 31:39.169
That was incredible.

31:39.169 --> 31:40.631
You're gonna be a star.

31:40.631 --> 31:41.883
‐ Oh, thanks, man.

31:41.883 --> 31:44.179
‐ I loved the cane bit.

31:44.179 --> 31:46.434
It's like you're a pimp
or something.

31:46.434 --> 31:48.939
‐ Nah, I actually need this
to walk.

31:53.574 --> 31:55.285
Hey, yo.

31:55.285 --> 31:56.663
What up, baby?

31:56.663 --> 31:58.834
‐ Hey, yo, I was feeling
your performance earlier.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.713
‐ Oh, yeah? Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

32:00.713 --> 32:03.092
Yo, what'd you say
your name was again?

32:03.092 --> 32:07.059
‐ It's, uh... it's Rakeem.

32:07.059 --> 32:10.106
‐ Yeah, you don't sound
so sure about that.

32:10.106 --> 32:11.442
‐ I'm very sure, baby.

32:11.442 --> 32:14.073
‐ Bobby.
Let me borrow you for a minute.

32:14.073 --> 32:15.701
Excuse me.

32:15.701 --> 32:19.959
‐ Yo, I'ma‐‐I'ma holler
at you soon, a'ight?

32:19.959 --> 32:21.128
‐ Monica.

32:21.128 --> 32:23.592
Monica Lynch
from Tommy Boy Records.

32:23.592 --> 32:26.097
My client, Bobby.

32:26.097 --> 32:27.850
‐ Such a pleasure, Bobby.

32:27.850 --> 32:29.353
‐ Yo, pleasure's all mine.

32:29.353 --> 32:33.277
‐ We'd be very interested in
having you come in this week.

32:33.277 --> 32:35.448
‐ I'd love to.

32:35.448 --> 32:37.578
‐ Andre.
‐ Hey!

32:37.578 --> 32:39.541
How are you, my friend?
‐ Oh, I'm well, I'm well.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.210
‐ Hey, listen, my son wants
to meet your new star.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.214
‐ Ah.
Steve.

32:43.214 --> 32:47.765
Bobby, Jules and Steve Rifkind
from Spring Records.

32:47.765 --> 32:48.934
‐ Hey.
‐ Oh, yeah, man.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.270
‐ Bobby, so good
to meet you, man.

32:50.270 --> 32:52.274
The performance was awesome.

32:52.274 --> 32:55.865
‐ He keeps telling me
I gotta get back into hip‐hop.

32:55.865 --> 32:59.204
But I just don't see it
going anywhere.

32:59.204 --> 33:00.541
‐ Okay.

33:00.541 --> 33:01.710
‐ I see it
going pretty far, Dad,

33:01.710 --> 33:03.797
you know,
the people love it, so.

33:03.797 --> 33:06.218
‐ Look, I see a lot
of potential here.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.431
You're a good‐looking kid.
We can take you far.

33:08.431 --> 33:10.143
And you can be
the next Father MC.

33:10.143 --> 33:11.270
Yeah, that's cool,

33:11.270 --> 33:12.982
but that pretty boy rap
really ain't me.

33:12.982 --> 33:14.986
Sign with me.
Follow my lead.

33:14.986 --> 33:18.702
Don't worry about anything
except being a star.

33:18.702 --> 33:20.163
Sounds better
than slanging on the corner

33:20.163 --> 33:21.958
and getting locked up, right?

33:24.254 --> 33:26.091
‐ Yo, I ain't no drug dealer.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.473
‐ Yeah.
Of course not.

33:29.473 --> 33:31.561
‐ I ain't did
no jail time neither.

33:31.561 --> 33:33.231
No prison, no probation.

33:33.231 --> 33:36.195
Definitely no parole.
None of that shit.

33:36.195 --> 33:39.994
How the fuck you even gonna say
some shit like that to me, man?

33:39.994 --> 33:41.915
‐ Okay, okay, look,
I'm just saying.

33:41.915 --> 33:43.292
‐ Yo, get the fuck away
from me.

33:48.553 --> 33:50.599
‐ Has your man lost
his fucking mind?

33:53.104 --> 33:54.273
Hey.

33:54.273 --> 33:55.818
You about to get
the fuck out of here, man.

33:55.818 --> 33:58.532
Come on.
Come on.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.431
‐ Hey, yo, yo, yo, what's‐‐
what's wrong, girl?

34:11.431 --> 34:13.311
No, no, no.
Down.

34:13.311 --> 34:14.772
Come here.

34:18.195 --> 34:20.449
Chill.
Chill, chill.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.344
Shit, I'm sorry, girl.

34:30.344 --> 34:32.683
I guess I'm the only one
who feeds you now, huh?

34:34.520 --> 34:36.190
Down.

34:45.793 --> 34:46.795
Yo.

34:52.723 --> 34:55.603
‐ Any more
of that chicken left?

34:55.603 --> 34:58.735
‐ No, I gave the rest to Sheba.

34:58.735 --> 35:01.741
Yo, I gotta go and pick up
some dog food tomorrow.

35:07.168 --> 35:10.926
So how was, uh,
how was that new job?

35:10.926 --> 35:13.222
‐ It's a'ight.

35:17.773 --> 35:19.234
So.

35:21.865 --> 35:25.121
You're not working
at the park no more?

35:25.121 --> 35:26.457
‐ I've been busy.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.169
I know it's not fun,

35:28.169 --> 35:30.632
selling weed
to Wall Street dudes all day,

35:30.632 --> 35:33.262
but that's the hustle.

35:33.262 --> 35:35.057
Life's all about doing shit

35:35.057 --> 35:37.020
that you don't want to do.

35:37.020 --> 35:40.903
Now, you know what happens when
I don't show up to a job now?

35:40.903 --> 35:42.656
I go back to jail.

35:42.656 --> 35:45.203
Now, you want to end up just
another statistic like me?

35:45.203 --> 35:46.288
‐ Yo, you're‐‐

35:46.288 --> 35:47.750
you're not
another statistic, 'Vine.

35:47.750 --> 35:50.964
‐ But that's what the world
sees me as.

35:50.964 --> 35:52.843
Hmm?
Now, what did Mommy say?

35:52.843 --> 35:55.599
We have to try and make
something of ourselves.

35:58.437 --> 36:00.651
Yo, sometimes,
I think you don't understand

36:00.651 --> 36:02.780
how hard it's gonna be
out there.

36:13.008 --> 36:15.388
Maybe I protected you too much.

36:17.685 --> 36:20.691
‐ Yo, I wasn't trying
to ditch work.

36:22.443 --> 36:24.866
Gary met this manager.

36:24.866 --> 36:27.788
We had this performance
at this club in Manhattan,

36:27.788 --> 36:32.590
and yo, 'Vine, I killed it.

36:34.802 --> 36:38.518
This manager thinks
I got a real shot at a deal.

36:38.518 --> 36:43.027
I have this meeting soon,
and, yo, if it goes well,

36:43.027 --> 36:45.489
maybe I could call Mommy,

36:45.489 --> 36:47.536
and I could tell her

36:47.536 --> 36:52.378
I actually made something
of myself.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.924
For real.

37:06.741 --> 37:09.412
‐ That's good, man.

37:09.412 --> 37:11.166
That's...

37:13.045 --> 37:14.590
That's great.

37:18.682 --> 37:20.267
‐ Yeah.

37:27.198 --> 37:29.996
‐ Uh, Queen Latifah.

37:29.996 --> 37:31.749
Apache and the rest
of the Flavor Unit crew.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.043
‐ Damn, I didn't even know

37:33.043 --> 37:36.174
Apache was a part
of the Flavor Unit crew.

37:36.174 --> 37:37.761
You ever thought about, uh,

37:37.761 --> 37:39.598
putting them
on a record together?

37:39.598 --> 37:41.602
That shit would be crazy.

37:41.602 --> 37:43.230
‐ Do you know how many people
are in Flavor Unit?

37:43.230 --> 37:44.859
'Cause I can barely keep track.

37:44.859 --> 37:47.363
Just imagine trying to wrangle
all those artists for a record.

37:47.363 --> 37:49.284
‐ It'll be worth it, though.

37:49.284 --> 37:52.916
It'd kinda be like,
what, the Avengers.

37:52.916 --> 37:56.048
‐ Yeah, cassettes cost
more than comics.

37:57.425 --> 37:59.387
‐ Monica.
Oh, Bobby.

37:59.387 --> 38:01.684
This is our CEO, Tom Silverman.

38:01.684 --> 38:03.145
‐ Oh, pleasure.

38:03.145 --> 38:04.815
‐ Pleasure to meet you.
Glad we could get you in here.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.401
‐ Oh, thanks,
I'm happy to be here.

38:06.401 --> 38:07.654
Oh, we're glad
to have you.

38:07.654 --> 38:09.115
We think you got
big star potential.

38:09.115 --> 38:10.201
Want to get you in the studio,

38:10.201 --> 38:11.369
right away.

38:11.369 --> 38:12.581
‐ Oh.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.209
Word?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.254
‐ Oh, shit!

38:16.254 --> 38:17.465
Yeah.

38:17.465 --> 38:18.885
I'm telling you,
I'm sitting there with Monica

38:18.885 --> 38:20.346
and the CEO comes right in.

38:20.346 --> 38:21.808
It was fucking crazy.

38:21.808 --> 38:23.645
‐ It's not a coincidence,
my friend.

38:23.645 --> 38:25.147
It's a move.

38:25.147 --> 38:26.901
They're serious
about working with you.

38:26.901 --> 38:29.030
‐ Oh, shit.

38:29.030 --> 38:31.076
‐ I linked with Monica
and the exec who wants Gary

38:31.076 --> 38:32.704
over at Cold Chillin'.

38:32.704 --> 38:34.959
I figured I'd book
your studio time together.

38:34.959 --> 38:37.296
‐ Hell, yeah.

38:37.296 --> 38:38.633
Yeah, and once
we in there back‐to‐back,

38:38.633 --> 38:40.469
I can get my boys in there too.

38:40.469 --> 38:42.056
Let's keep
it small, huh?

38:42.056 --> 38:43.475
I'm not trying to get
half of Staten Island

38:43.475 --> 38:44.770
into this session.

38:44.770 --> 38:47.734
Especially not Shotgun.

38:47.734 --> 38:49.697
‐ Wait, what?

38:49.697 --> 38:51.659
I thought‐‐
I thought y'all said y'all was

38:51.659 --> 38:52.953
trying to sign him.

38:52.953 --> 38:54.832
‐ I did.
Not now.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.711
Can't be acting like that.

38:58.380 --> 38:59.592
‐ Yo, he's just‐‐

38:59.592 --> 39:02.346
he's just going through
some shit, man.

39:02.346 --> 39:06.229
I mean, his boy just died.
It really messed him up.

39:06.229 --> 39:07.481
Can't we just take him?

39:07.481 --> 39:09.485
‐ I'm not taking him anywhere.

39:17.753 --> 39:19.464
You talk to Andre?

39:22.303 --> 39:23.514
‐ Yeah.

39:24.642 --> 39:27.606
‐ Shit.

39:27.606 --> 39:28.900
What happened?

39:31.572 --> 39:33.367
‐ I don't know, son.

39:36.122 --> 39:38.043
‐ Shit, man.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.672
For sure, you know you dope.

39:45.224 --> 39:46.852
‐ Go get that cream, son.

40:03.678 --> 40:05.974
Come on, please!
He's been good!

40:05.974 --> 40:07.602
He's been working a job.

40:07.602 --> 40:09.397
He's been checking in
with his PO.

40:09.397 --> 40:10.859
‐ Hey, man.

40:10.859 --> 40:13.322
Y'all win that game?

40:13.322 --> 40:14.908
‐ How old is he?

40:14.908 --> 40:17.581
He's living here with a known
addict with drugs in the house?

40:17.581 --> 40:20.002
‐ Hey, no, man.
No, I didn't do‐‐

40:21.839 --> 40:23.760
Now, I don't know where you
found that stuff, man.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.012
I ain't bring any drugs
in this house.

40:25.012 --> 40:26.264
Don't you lie
to me, all right?

40:26.264 --> 40:27.517
I'll have child services
here so fast,

40:27.517 --> 40:28.519
your head will spin.

40:28.519 --> 40:30.356
‐ No, no, he's not his son.

40:30.356 --> 40:33.236
He's his nephew, and he's been
living with his mother,

40:33.236 --> 40:35.199
in Staten Island!

40:36.577 --> 40:38.581
‐ All right, well,
go on home, then.

40:38.581 --> 40:41.211
This is no place for kids.

40:41.211 --> 40:43.256
‐ Yo, where you taking him?

40:43.256 --> 40:45.845
‐ It's okay, man.

40:45.845 --> 40:47.098
You'll see me soon.

40:47.098 --> 40:49.853
Come on.
You'll see me soon.

40:51.941 --> 40:53.653
You'll see me soon.

40:55.865 --> 40:57.493
It's okay.

40:57.493 --> 40:59.623
You'll see me soon.

41:06.512 --> 41:08.140
‐ Tommy Boy signed you
to a single deal.

41:08.140 --> 41:09.810
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff
from you, man.

41:09.810 --> 41:11.856
But I ain't heard a single yet.

41:11.856 --> 41:14.068
You don't get an album
if you don't have a single.

41:14.068 --> 41:16.030
Something
that distinguishes you.

41:16.030 --> 41:17.534
It's gotta be catchy.

41:17.534 --> 41:19.036
‐ Yeah.
Yeah, I hear you.

41:19.036 --> 41:20.372
I hear you.

41:20.372 --> 41:21.834
‐ How about this?

41:21.834 --> 41:23.796
Everyone loves
a James Brown hook.

41:26.259 --> 41:27.344
‐ Yeah.

41:27.344 --> 41:29.516
Everybody runs it ragged.

41:29.516 --> 41:32.522
It's a little too obvious.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.544
Yo.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.214
Seriously?
