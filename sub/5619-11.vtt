00:02.128 --> 00:04.130
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.964 --> 00:07.175
<i>A team centred
around people with powers?</i>

00:07.258 --> 00:09.511
Seems I might just get my team after all.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.346
<i>Thousands of years ago,</i>

00:11.429 --> 00:14.808
an Inhuman was born on this planet
that was destined to rule it.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.936
That others were consumed with dread,
and so they banished it from the Earth,

00:18.019 --> 00:20.313
<i>HYDRA was founded
with the sole purpose</i>

00:20.438 --> 00:22.023
<i>of engineering its return.</i>

00:22.107 --> 00:24.442
<i>He saved my life, and
I never would've survived without him.</i>

00:24.526 --> 00:26.277
<i>- Do you love him?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:26.361 --> 00:27.445
I can't hate him.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.239
Why else would you fall for him?
He did everything right.

00:29.322 --> 00:31.616
And you dove through a hole
in the universe for me!

00:32.826 --> 00:34.994
- You're not Will.
- Will died saving Jemma.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.287
<i>From me.</i>

00:44.379 --> 00:45.755
<i>Now you know how it feels,
Coulson.</i>

00:45.839 --> 00:48.383
<i>To watch someone you care for
bleed out right in front of you.</i>

00:48.466 --> 00:50.176
<i>And now
I'm coming to put you down.</i>

00:50.385 --> 00:52.804
It's over, Ward.

00:53.388 --> 00:54.723
<i>Malick was right.</i>

00:55.515 --> 00:57.100
<i>This is all meant to be.</i>

00:57.183 --> 00:59.227
<i>I'm part of a grand plan.</i>

03:45.852 --> 03:47.812
This can't be easy.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.148
It's fine.

03:50.982 --> 03:52.609
Can I ask why here?

03:53.943 --> 03:55.737
I want him to see where it happened.

03:55.820 --> 04:00.158
Besides, I wasn't about to give him
the location of our base.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.620
And apparently,
he didn't want to invite us to his house.

04:03.703 --> 04:04.829
All clear.

04:11.127 --> 04:13.379
- Mr President.
- Director Coulson.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.673
Thank you for meeting me.
Long overdue.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.677
Rosalind spoke highly of you.

04:19.802 --> 04:22.137
She believed that
I should be working with S.H.I.E.L.D.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.140
I did always value her judgement.

04:24.849 --> 04:25.934
I'll miss her.

04:26.017 --> 04:29.062
I assume we're not here
to share memories of a fallen friend.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.899
This... This problem...

04:33.024 --> 04:36.694
Rosalind said
you called them Inhumans.

04:37.487 --> 04:40.448
Heads of state are calling,
not sure what's happening.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.825
Watchdog agencies
hurling accusations,

04:42.909 --> 04:44.869
Fox News won't shut up.

04:44.994 --> 04:47.538
I don't need to tell you
how delicate the situation is,

04:47.664 --> 04:48.957
but we have to do something.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.377
With all due respect, Mr President,
we are doing something.

05:07.725 --> 05:08.893
You're doing good.

05:09.394 --> 05:11.604
I'm not great at projecting authority.

05:12.730 --> 05:16.067
It's nice to talk Spanish, though.
Reminds me of home.

05:16.693 --> 05:17.735
Do you miss it?

05:18.361 --> 05:21.072
Especially Sundays.
Mom cooks on Sundays.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.450
And you?
You have people?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.369
Sort of. Not really.

05:27.078 --> 05:28.746
Colonel Ramon.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.623
I speak English, if it makes this easier.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.083
It does, thank you.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.876
This way, to my office.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.088
We're following up a report.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.674
Your officers were attacked
by a powered assailant?

05:39.757 --> 05:42.552
Yes. We're already overwhelmed
by the guns, drugs and kidnappings,

05:42.635 --> 05:44.262
and now these things.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.473
Are they really aliens?

05:47.598 --> 05:49.892
It's a little bit
more complicated than that.

05:49.976 --> 05:52.854
But like everyone else,
there are good ones and bad ones.

05:52.937 --> 05:55.523
But when they are bad,
we are powerless to stop them.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.316
That convoy was loaded with weapons

05:57.442 --> 05:59.402
that were supposed to help us fight
whatever this is.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.404
And now, weapons are gone.

06:01.487 --> 06:02.530
But we're here.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.450
We've got a team on the ground
and we're here to help.

06:05.950 --> 06:10.121
I don't know how it is
that your agency still exists,

06:10.246 --> 06:12.248
nor do I want to know.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.333
But I appreciate your help.

06:14.459 --> 06:16.169
Does that mean
you're reauthorising S.H.I.E.L.D.?

06:16.294 --> 06:19.088
The public has a short memory,
but not that short.

06:19.172 --> 06:22.675
The image of helicarriers
crashing down on the nation's capital

06:22.800 --> 06:24.218
is hard to forget.

06:24.302 --> 06:27.972
Then why is this meeting happening
if S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't exist?

06:30.808 --> 06:34.312
Because I need you
to keep doing what you're doing.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.647
Privately.

06:37.482 --> 06:41.360
Publicly, the ATCU will still be the face

06:41.486 --> 06:44.363
of my administration's response
to advanced threats.

06:44.489 --> 06:46.991
I'll appoint a new head of the agency.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.160
One who understands
they answer to you.

06:49.952 --> 06:53.081
So, we're your black ops response?

06:53.164 --> 06:55.666
Isn't black ops
where you feel the most comfortable?

06:55.792 --> 06:58.002
I certainly prefer it to bureaucracy.

06:58.711 --> 07:01.589
Okay, then,
we'll keep doing what we do,

07:01.672 --> 07:03.549
and you'll keep pretending
we don't exist.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.636
Exactly.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.347
One last thing.

07:11.641 --> 07:14.352
- Gideon Malick.
- I can't help you.

07:15.561 --> 07:18.439
He ordered this hit. He's HYDRA.

07:18.523 --> 07:20.858
Even if you can prove any of that,

07:20.983 --> 07:25.113
Gideon Malick has a stake
in almost every country's economy.

07:25.196 --> 07:28.157
He advises world leaders,
he's served on the World Council.

07:28.241 --> 07:31.619
He's spent a lifetime
and a fortune building influence.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.663
I can't pull that thread.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.915
But you can let him walk free?

07:36.040 --> 07:37.959
Rosalind bled to death, right here.

07:38.042 --> 07:43.256
Malick may have blood on his hands,
but my hands are tied.

07:43.923 --> 07:46.217
Yours are not.

07:48.553 --> 07:50.221
Is there any intel you're willing to give?

07:50.847 --> 07:53.349
Never spent enough time with the man
to get in his head.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.270
Listen, I'm aware of your sacrifices.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.064
I thank you for your service.

08:00.857 --> 08:03.943
I'll be in touch when I've named
a new head to the ATCU.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.529
We're on the move.

08:09.699 --> 08:12.076
Sorry he didn't give you an angle
to go at Malick.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.704
Actually, he may have.

08:17.081 --> 08:19.208
I've seen this before.

08:19.292 --> 08:20.751
Protests in Beirut.

08:20.877 --> 08:24.422
Urban rioting 101.
Child's play compared to the real issue.

08:25.298 --> 08:28.384
Powers, wrong hands, again.

08:30.136 --> 08:31.804
This could be something.

08:34.724 --> 08:38.019
An entire armoury's worth of
military might nicked from a police van,

08:38.102 --> 08:40.605
right under the nose of the police
in less than four minutes.

08:40.730 --> 08:43.900
The two of us, trained, experienced,
we couldn't pull this off.

08:43.982 --> 08:48.321
But all it takes is one tainted fish taco
and...

08:48.946 --> 08:51.407
Unfair advantage, really.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.117
Transmission starting now.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.368
No offence intended.

08:54.452 --> 08:57.663
Yeah, no, it's great,
being hunted, feared, it's a blast.

08:58.998 --> 09:02.460
Metal scraping on an urban street,
a million-and-one possibilities.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.590
Fitz.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.593
I hate to bother you,
but is there something I'm not seeing?

09:19.477 --> 09:20.645
No.

09:20.770 --> 09:24.148
You're right, it's, um, inconclusive.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.108
Copy that.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.069
So, as far as
the police on the scene believe,

09:28.152 --> 09:29.737
whoever attacked them was invisible.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.864
- We've seen weirder.
- Yeah.

09:33.157 --> 09:36.244
Invisibility. Imagine the possibilities.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.828
What are you imagining?

09:37.954 --> 09:40.039
- Nothing fun.
- Get used to it.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.083
We can't put the Terrigen genie
back in the bottle.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.417
Powers are the new normal.

09:43.501 --> 09:45.878
- I think you're just jealous.
- Damned right, I am.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.589
Tell me you didn't try
one of those little fish oil pills.

09:48.673 --> 09:50.675
I had my fingers crossed
for x-ray vision.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.680
I was just curious.

09:56.514 --> 09:58.307
I wasn't the only one.

09:59.392 --> 10:02.311
I mean, I thought about it,
I didn't actually do it.

10:02.395 --> 10:04.313
Rehab was a bitch.

10:04.397 --> 10:06.190
You two deserve each other.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.192
Let's fan out. Cover more ground.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.064
Pretty nifty magic trick you did there.

10:49.108 --> 10:51.068
You'd think three years
high school Spanish...

10:52.445 --> 10:54.363
All right, all right.
Don't do anything stupid.

10:54.447 --> 10:55.531
We're just here to...

11:32.735 --> 11:34.945
How do you lose someone
as big as Mack?

11:35.071 --> 11:38.407
I don't know. Same way
one loses a truckload of weapons.

11:38.491 --> 11:41.327
Good thing a grocery store down
the street is security conscious.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.579
Here we go.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.831
Who's he looking at?

11:49.418 --> 11:50.461
What did we just watch?

11:57.927 --> 11:59.178
<i>How accelerated, exactly?</i>

11:59.303 --> 12:01.305
Approximately six metres
in the 30th of a second

12:01.430 --> 12:03.140
that one frame of video was exposed.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.809
So, very.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.394
<i>Well, catching her won't be easy.</i>

12:06.477 --> 12:08.104
I'll reconfigure the containment module.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.855
- If we can even get her in there.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

12:10.356 --> 12:12.400
- So you do that remotely?
- Exactly.

12:12.483 --> 12:15.486
The polytechnic material then adapts
to the powers we're dealing with.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.988
A necessity since
Inhuman powers are so random.

12:18.114 --> 12:19.949
- Not true.
- I'm sorry?

12:21.617 --> 12:23.077
Powers aren't random.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.664
We were taught that each is given
to fill an evolutionary need at the time.

12:26.831 --> 12:27.832
Are you being serious?

12:27.957 --> 12:31.001
To create equilibrium
within the species.

12:31.127 --> 12:33.003
Yin yang and all that.

12:33.129 --> 12:34.755
At least that's what we were taught.

12:34.839 --> 12:35.923
Huh.

12:36.507 --> 12:38.467
An actual intelligent design.

12:50.438 --> 12:52.022
Oh. Uh, sir, I think you're gonna be...

12:52.148 --> 12:54.108
Stop what you're doing
and come with me.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.698
- What do you think of Mr Campbell?
- Lincoln?

13:00.823 --> 13:03.951
Smart, obviously
most helpful in helping us,

13:04.034 --> 13:06.954
Jemma, understand Inhuman biology.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.789
And it's been good for her.

13:08.873 --> 13:11.292
Keeping her busy,
focusing on something else.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.627
Things still feel different, though.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.881
But how could they not
after what I did to Will?

13:20.384 --> 13:22.887
You did what you had to do.
We both did.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.722
Sometimes there's no choice
but the hard choice.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.724
That's the job.

13:36.192 --> 13:38.569
- Now set up the machine.
- Sir,

13:38.694 --> 13:40.362
- you're not really...
- It's not for me.

13:42.156 --> 13:45.326
There's one person who might have
information about Gideon Malick.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.203
I need to get into his head.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.105
Been waiting for you to come back.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.786
So you snap back to the same spot.
Like a yo-yo.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.912
Good to know.

14:31.789 --> 14:32.957
How about you let me...

14:35.793 --> 14:37.127
Damn it.

14:38.254 --> 14:39.630
I'm starting to hate you.

14:45.261 --> 14:47.304
Von Strucker
is in a persistent vegetative state,

14:47.388 --> 14:49.473
significant portions of his brain
are damaged.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.231
Sir, I'm not sure what you want to do
is even possible.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.276
Let's find out. It's worth a shot
if it gets us closer to Malick.

15:05.155 --> 15:08.325
We were alerted to a police report,
Bogotá, Colombia.

15:08.409 --> 15:09.660
I've dispatched a team.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.913
We need to replace our losses.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.584
Dr Garner did a lot of damage.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.669
And our guest needs Inhumans.

15:19.837 --> 15:22.423
You have doubts.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.009
He can barely stand. Doesn't speak.

15:25.676 --> 15:29.179
Because he's spent hundreds of years
clinging to life.

15:29.305 --> 15:30.431
Trying to survive in the few men

15:30.514 --> 15:32.683
we were able to sacrifice
every few decades.

15:34.143 --> 15:35.519
But I'm not a fool.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.104
Keep your eyes open.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.356
I don't want my faith to be misplaced.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.862
Sir. He's asking for you.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.196
He spoke?

16:10.387 --> 16:12.139
How can I help you?

16:22.399 --> 16:24.234
What do you need?

16:33.243 --> 16:34.870
I'm hungry.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.505
Chair's an upgrade. Least there's that.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.424
Yeah, again,
I don't know what you're saying.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.263
<i>Policía</i>. Yeah.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.265
You stole <i>pistolas</i> from the <i>policia.</i>

16:55.391 --> 16:59.019
And sold the <i>pistolas</i>
to your <i>amigos,</i> criminals.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.942
Yeah, you. Whoosh, whoosh. Criminal.

17:11.699 --> 17:14.242
<i>Dios?</i> You think God did this?

17:16.286 --> 17:19.707
You think it was a gift
from <i>Dios</i> or <i>pescado?</i>

17:21.250 --> 17:24.712
Yeah, fish. I know my way
around a menu.

17:37.975 --> 17:40.060
I think you're talking about
Terrigenesis.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.646
- Terrigenesis.
- Yeah.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.398
You're an alien.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.733
My partner's one, too.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.110
You'll see her soon enough.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.497
- Thank God.
- Hey, you.

18:06.420 --> 18:07.629
Her?

18:08.172 --> 18:09.923
Don't make me crush you.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.259
So this recovers lost memories?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.595
But it's a dangerous procedure
on a healthy subject.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.097
And Werner's anything but.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.682
Anoxic brain trauma.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.851
Prefrontal cortex is barely active.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.770
But memories are backed up
in other areas as well.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.688
Traces and images
tucked throughout the brain.

18:24.772 --> 18:26.315
We just need to dig them out.

18:30.319 --> 18:31.528
You have a problem with this?

18:33.322 --> 18:34.615
Because I do.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.533
I've been in this thing, twice.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.620
Getting my arm cut off
was pleasant by comparison.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.372
But they're telling me
Gideon Malick is untouchable.

18:42.498 --> 18:43.874
I won't accept that.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.460
- We good to go?
- Yes, sir.

18:50.672 --> 18:54.384
Werner, I need your help.
Concentrate on Gideon Malick.

18:55.552 --> 18:57.012
Just kill me.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.890
Just kill me.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.517
Just kill me.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.894
Just kill me.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.647
Just kill me!

19:07.397 --> 19:08.398
Just kill me.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.192
Just kill me.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.069
Just kill me.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.240
She'll wake up soon.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.493
And when she does,
I want to you run point on intake.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.078
What do we know about her?

19:21.161 --> 19:23.664
Other than the kidnapping
and the gunrunning?

19:23.747 --> 19:25.541
She works a clerical job at a museum.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.501
At night, art classes.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.170
Artist turned gunrunner. Kind of sexy.

19:30.254 --> 19:31.839
No record.

19:32.548 --> 19:33.757
It doesn't add up.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.592
She got powers, that's how it adds up.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.429
Andrew was a lovely head shrinker

19:39.555 --> 19:42.516
before he turned into
a not-so-lovely Inhuman serial killer.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.852
- Point made.
- Fair enough.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.896
Mack, is this the accomplice
that you mentioned?

19:49.189 --> 19:50.440
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

19:50.524 --> 19:53.569
Her cousin, lives by her, also no record.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.072
- Why are they taking those weapons?
- Hunter and I will go track him down.

20:11.587 --> 20:12.629
You're up.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.562
She's feisty.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.314
Yeah, she's not happy
to be locked in there.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.232
I guess the shoe's on the other foot.

20:32.316 --> 20:33.775
You're enjoying this.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.319
Mm. Maybe a little.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.084
You trying to regain strength?

20:56.173 --> 20:57.841
You were hurt pretty bad.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.509
The body was dead.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.845
I was dying.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.476
They've advanced,
but they haven't changed.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.353
"They"?

21:09.853 --> 21:11.521
Humans.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.775
But you're not human any more,
are you?

21:20.489 --> 21:22.783
You don't believe I am what they say.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.369
Once I'm strong enough...

21:27.371 --> 21:28.705
You will.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.710
Just kill me. Just kill me.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.214
Just kill me. Just kill me!

21:37.798 --> 21:39.132
- Just kill me!
- This isn't working.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.551
He's stuck in a moment of trauma.
We can't snap him out of it.

21:41.677 --> 21:42.886
I know what that's like...

21:43.011 --> 21:44.388
Just kill me!

21:44.513 --> 21:46.807
- Just kill me.
- What about him?

21:46.890 --> 21:48.642
- Just kill me.
- Me?

21:48.725 --> 21:51.311
Neurons communicate
using electrical impulses.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.480
You could stimulate
other areas of his brain.

21:53.563 --> 21:54.856
Targeted electroshock.

21:54.982 --> 21:56.483
Hell, no. I'm not doing that.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.568
Well, at the very least,
it could jolt him out of this loop.

21:58.694 --> 22:00.904
- Or fry his cerebrum.
- He's suffering.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.407
- You could help him snap out of it.
- Just kill me. Just kill me.

22:03.532 --> 22:04.741
Just kill me.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.161
Just kill me.

22:08.245 --> 22:09.705
Just kill me.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.749
Just kill me.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.173
It's working.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.434
Tell me
about Gideon Malick.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.394
I'll handle everything.

22:33.729 --> 22:35.856
You sold me out. You sold me out.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.858
Before he sold you out,
you reached him.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.609
- How?
- You sold me out.

22:39.693 --> 22:40.902
<i>Tell me how.</i>

22:41.737 --> 22:43.447
<i>Dad said only as a last resort.</i>

22:46.450 --> 22:48.952
Perizad sent me.
We went to Princeton together.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.418
I was afraid.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.628
I didn't have anywhere else to turn.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.465
I didn't know where else to turn.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.467
And now we do.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.110
Tell her S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't really with anyone.

23:22.319 --> 23:23.487
We're sort of our own thing.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.826
And she said her powers
were a gift from God.

23:40.921 --> 23:42.297
I think we were wrong about her.

23:42.964 --> 23:46.009
Ask her about the convoy.
Why'd she take those weapons?

24:21.044 --> 24:23.505
But they belong to the police.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.470
Thieves in uniform.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.071
Found him.
He was dumping weapons into the river.

24:49.406 --> 24:50.574
She's telling the truth.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.330
We've got visitors.
Local law enforcement.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.749
Okay, well, be careful,
not everyone's on this side of the law.

24:59.833 --> 25:00.876
<i>We're on our way.</i>

25:02.335 --> 25:03.420
Stay with him.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.926
- What's going on here?
- We've got this.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.012
World Health Organisation jurisdiction.

25:16.516 --> 25:19.895
You don't really expect me
to just drive away, do you?

25:20.729 --> 25:22.439
Guess not.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.234
It would've been easier if you had.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.905
Hunter and Bobbi were gone
by the time we got there.

26:11.988 --> 26:15.075
Elena's cousin,
the police just left him there.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.662
I need to tell Coulson
what's going on.

26:18.828 --> 26:21.665
I haven't seen a lot of dead bodies,
but is that normal?

26:22.165 --> 26:24.125
No. It's too soon
for rigour mortis to set in.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.671
But maybe they have
another kind of weapon.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.339
An Inhuman?

26:30.173 --> 26:32.342
I don't see how Bobbi and Hunter
were taken otherwise.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.262
Elena has been asking about him.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.359
I'm sorry.

27:08.878 --> 27:11.047
Hunter. Are you okay?

27:11.673 --> 27:13.800
It hurts.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.552
Yeah.

27:16.386 --> 27:17.887
Pain means it's wearing off.

27:18.388 --> 27:20.223
Ugh. Bloody powers.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.817
Good afternoon, beautiful.

27:32.235 --> 27:34.029
I need you to answer questions.

27:34.321 --> 27:37.407
His fate depends on your answers.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.076
Why are you really here?

27:54.841 --> 27:56.259
Uh, Joey's here to...

27:59.429 --> 28:00.764
Here's the thing,

28:02.098 --> 28:03.600
it's not something I talk about,

28:03.725 --> 28:06.019
but like you, I rely on my faith.

28:11.524 --> 28:14.069
And somehow I never made
the connection till you said it.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.365
But maybe these powers,

28:18.448 --> 28:20.533
these gifts that you have,
that Daisy has.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.118
Maybe they're not random.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.287
Maybe it's part of a plan.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.461
She believes she's meant
to do good with these gifts.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.046
We believe the same thing.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.217
We need to help each other.
To stop them.

28:52.107 --> 28:53.149
She's in.

28:54.651 --> 28:55.819
How do your powers work?

29:00.949 --> 29:02.409
It's connected to her pulse.

29:02.492 --> 29:05.120
What does that mean?
What's the radius on her powers?

29:10.625 --> 29:12.669
As far as she can go in one heartbeat.

29:47.036 --> 29:48.455
You're my new best friend.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.709
Okay. Here.

29:53.460 --> 29:55.545
Two figures not moving, but alive.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.380
Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.

29:57.505 --> 30:00.633
The other figures moving in the station,
assume bad guys.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.052
One of them has powers.
So best we avoid him.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.555
To that end...

30:07.557 --> 30:09.893
At S.H.I.E.L.D.,
we do better than duct tape.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.326
Joey, you seeing this?

30:26.910 --> 30:27.952
Mmm-hmm.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.120
Take care of it.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.080
Why are you here?

30:31.164 --> 30:32.916
We're part of an alien task force.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.877
There's an invasion happening
of powered people,

30:35.960 --> 30:38.421
like Medusa-eyes over there.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.386
Like I said, alien invasion.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.462
Okay. You grab their weapons, and I'll...

31:25.260 --> 31:26.636
Or you do that.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.143
Maybe you should make a run for it?

31:39.566 --> 31:41.901
Mack, you need to warn the others.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.614
<i>The Inhuman,
the power's in his eyes.</i>

31:46.739 --> 31:48.408
No, Elena, don't.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.005
His glasses.

32:09.178 --> 32:10.305
Elena.

32:23.610 --> 32:24.819
Perizad sent me.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.157
We went to Princeton together.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.414
<i>Hold, please.</i>

33:33.012 --> 33:34.097
Werner?

33:34.180 --> 33:37.058
No. He's in no shape
to make phone calls these days.

33:37.141 --> 33:38.309
<i>You made sure of that.</i>

33:38.893 --> 33:40.687
If I'm talking to Gideon Malick.

33:42.355 --> 33:43.648
<i>I'll take that as a yes.</i>

33:44.273 --> 33:45.441
Phil Coulson here.

33:47.527 --> 33:49.445
Is this about Rosalind Price?

33:49.987 --> 33:51.698
The man who took her is gone.

33:51.906 --> 33:53.324
As will be everything you value.

33:53.616 --> 33:55.451
It's started to unravel, hasn't it?

33:56.077 --> 33:57.453
<i>Your portal, gone.</i>

33:57.704 --> 33:59.539
The Inhumans you stockpiled,
murdered.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.751
It wasn't easy to get this number,
but this call will cost you.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.379
<i>We're tracking this line
everywhere it connects.</i>

34:07.422 --> 34:09.966
It'll cost me millions, to be sure.

34:10.091 --> 34:12.592
I'll have to shut down a few offices.

34:13.678 --> 34:16.097
But don't get too far ahead of yourself,
Mr Coulson.

34:17.473 --> 34:20.393
My influence reaches
a little bit farther than that.

34:25.732 --> 34:27.024
We'll configure the module to hold him

34:27.108 --> 34:29.025
and get Bobbi, Hunter,
and Elena to medical.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.449
<i>This is HYDRA 6. We've arrived.</i>

34:45.960 --> 34:47.043
What is that?

34:51.382 --> 34:52.717
HYDRA.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.164
She's not wrong.

35:33.925 --> 35:35.843
She's a perfect fit
for this team you're trying to build.

35:35.927 --> 35:38.596
Except for the pesky little fact
she doesn't want any part of it.

35:38.679 --> 35:40.807
Look, she's also vulnerable out there.

35:41.766 --> 35:44.435
It might be a good thing
keeping her close. It's safer.

35:46.729 --> 35:48.314
Don't look at me like that.

35:50.733 --> 35:51.984
Is it safer?

35:52.068 --> 35:53.945
Four of us in one place
makes us vulnerable.

35:54.028 --> 35:56.030
Like the 12 Inhumans Lash killed.

35:56.572 --> 35:58.991
It's hard to build a team
if everyone's spread over the world.

35:59.492 --> 36:01.118
When I was a hacker,
my team and I, we were tight,

36:01.202 --> 36:02.537
and we weren't on the same continent.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.038
Huh.

36:04.622 --> 36:06.624
With the right tech solution,
it could work.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.710
Let's hope the Director agrees.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.676
If we need backup or if you do,

36:17.593 --> 36:18.928
we're a tap away.

36:22.723 --> 36:24.141
Backup.

36:24.809 --> 36:25.852
I'm...

36:26.602 --> 36:28.354
I'm sorry for kidnapping you.

36:34.569 --> 36:36.153
I'll see you soon.

36:36.571 --> 36:37.738
Yo-yo.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.369
- Goodbye, Mack.
- Goodbye.

36:48.332 --> 36:49.792
How about you?

36:50.960 --> 36:53.421
Maybe you don't have to miss
dinner this Sunday.

37:06.392 --> 37:07.643
When did you get done?

37:08.811 --> 37:11.230
Uh, earlier today.
I think he's gonna like this one.

37:13.232 --> 37:14.483
How are you?

37:14.567 --> 37:17.528
Must be fascinating, getting to know
all about Inhuman DNA...

37:17.612 --> 37:18.905
I miss you.

37:20.197 --> 37:22.658
There it is. I miss you.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.495
I'm here.

37:26.829 --> 37:28.623
- Together. We're...
- Professional.

37:28.706 --> 37:31.375
And matter of fact, and there's this
chasm in the middle of the room.

37:31.459 --> 37:35.129
Of all these things, of our kiss,
and Will's death, and...

37:35.212 --> 37:38.007
And I'm sorry about that,
Jemma, because...

37:38.090 --> 37:40.760
Because maybe there was another way.

37:41.844 --> 37:43.262
And there was something else
that I could've done...

37:43.346 --> 37:45.139
Will died saving me.

37:45.222 --> 37:48.017
What you did was kill a thing, a monster.

37:48.684 --> 37:52.063
You've been nothing less
than extraordinary this whole time.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.525
So, um...

37:58.319 --> 38:01.405
About this chasm, as you call it.

38:03.574 --> 38:05.743
Can we start over?
Back to where we began.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.037
Sixteen and achingly shy.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.290
Two people, endlessly inquisitive,
about to embark on a relationship

38:11.374 --> 38:13.834
that will change their lives,
but they don't know where it will go.

38:17.171 --> 38:19.423
I'm Jemma Simmons. Biochemist.

38:23.928 --> 38:27.139
Leopold Fitz. Engineering.

38:40.444 --> 38:41.737
Hey, you.

38:41.946 --> 38:43.155
Welcome back.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.867
So, I just ran into Joey, packing up.

38:47.535 --> 38:50.037
Yeah.
You think I'm making a mistake?

38:51.080 --> 38:54.000
Letting him live a normal life
like everyone else?

38:54.083 --> 38:55.167
No, you're not.

38:55.251 --> 38:57.378
No, I mean, offering you the same deal.

38:57.670 --> 39:00.256
Your APB's been lifted.
No one's looking for you.

39:00.631 --> 39:02.967
You could go back to your old life,
if you want.

39:04.135 --> 39:05.386
I don't know.

39:06.554 --> 39:08.055
It's pretty interesting here.

39:08.931 --> 39:10.641
I was hoping you'd say that.

39:24.822 --> 39:26.073
You're trusting them more.

39:26.991 --> 39:28.159
It's good to delegate.

39:29.702 --> 39:31.579
So, it's not because
you don't trust yourself.

39:34.707 --> 39:35.791
It looks good.

39:37.460 --> 39:39.086
Fitz outdid himself on this one.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.338
Lots of bells and whistles.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.340
It's pretty fantastic.

39:43.424 --> 39:44.467
May I?

39:48.763 --> 39:49.805
Feels real.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.098
Feels like the others.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.642
It's not the hand. It's me.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.355
Maybe you're not
supposed to get over it.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.900
Some things you can't move past.

40:01.192 --> 40:03.944
They scar you.
Change you permanently.

40:05.988 --> 40:08.657
I don't know what happened there,
on that planet.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.619
I do.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.705
You joined the cavalry.

40:19.877 --> 40:23.839
<i>In a surprising move, Gothite
Industries closed 10 offices today.</i>

40:23.923 --> 40:26.425
<i>Stock prices continue to tumble
as investors react.</i>

40:26.801 --> 40:29.178
<i>Gideon Malick cannot be reached
for comment.</i>

40:29.261 --> 40:32.431
Sometimes you're wounded.
Sometimes you wound.

40:32.515 --> 40:35.726
- But he's still collecting Inhumans.
- Any theories as to why?

40:36.227 --> 40:39.647
Lincoln said Inhuman powers
create a balance for the species.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.273
An equilibrium.

40:41.857 --> 40:43.442
We got a lot of heroes on our side.

40:43.526 --> 40:45.653
Makes me wonder
what Malick has on his.

40:50.199 --> 40:51.575
Did we get the Inhuman?

40:51.909 --> 40:53.410
The doctors are with him now,

40:53.494 --> 40:55.579
but they say his powers are strong.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.873
At least we got some good news today.

41:13.139 --> 41:15.391
You wanna believe,
but you don't know if you can.

41:15.474 --> 41:16.976
Coulson survived.

41:17.351 --> 41:19.854
Could be you're not
who I thought you were.

41:32.616 --> 41:33.826
You'll believe.

41:35.369 --> 41:37.621
Once I make a believer out of him.

41:52.136 --> 41:55.514
<i>It makes perfect sense to name him
the head of the ATCU.</i>

41:55.598 --> 41:58.809
<i>He knows all the players,
the public respects military authority.</i>

41:58.893 --> 42:01.604
<i>- You've worked together.</i>
- I wouldn't exactly call it together.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.647
<i>He has the utmost respect for you.</i>

42:03.731 --> 42:04.899
Now I know you're lying.

42:04.982 --> 42:07.735
<i>Remember, he'll be taking
orders from you.</i>

42:07.818 --> 42:09.236
I'm sure he's thrilled about that.

42:10.487 --> 42:13.782
<i>I'm confident
this will work out, Coulson.</i>

42:15.159 --> 42:16.535
Mr President.

42:21.999 --> 42:23.334
Oh, boy.
