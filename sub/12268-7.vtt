IS DEATH.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.681

IT IS SIMPLY A MEANS

09:46.657 --> 09:47.958
(chuckles)
HEY, LITTLE BROTHER.
 HEY.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.119
BOUGHT INTO.
 I'M JUST THE CO-OWNER.

09:49.119 --> 09:51.061
FOR NOW, RIGHT?

09:51.061 --> 09:52.793
THERE'S GOOD MONEY
IN GETTING PEOPLE DRUNK.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.294
EVEN BETTER MONEY
IN THESE FIVE BOAT SLIPS

09:54.294 --> 09:55.896
WE NOW CO-OWN.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.167
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY'RE IN LONG-TERM LEASES

09:57.167 --> 09:58.228
WITH SOME LONGSHOREMEN.

09:58.228 --> 09:59.730
WELL, LEASES ARE MADE
TO BE BROKEN.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.231
DON'T FORGET
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

10:01.231 --> 10:02.673
THAT'S THE THING, IT TURNS OUT
THE KIDS ON THE MORTGAGE--

10:02.673 --> 10:03.804
THEY'RE GOOD GUYS.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.736
WELL, THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID
ABOUT THEIR OLD MAN

10:05.736 --> 10:07.638
AND THE REST OF THE BUSINESSES
ALONG THESE DOCKS.

10:07.638 --> 10:08.809
I REALLY GOTTA REMIND YOU?

10:08.809 --> 10:11.912
OLD MAN IS DEAD.
 THAT'S A DAMN SHAME.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.143
(Jack)
NEED ANY HELP WITH THAT?

10:13.143 --> 10:14.685
JACK, HEY.

10:14.685 --> 10:16.346
MEET MY BROTHER NATE.
 HEY.

10:16.346 --> 10:17.988
JACK'S MY PARTNER IN THE BAR.

10:17.988 --> 10:19.389
JACK PORTER.

10:19.389 --> 10:20.751
CONGRATULATIONS, PORTER.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.392
KENNY HERE--
HE'S GOT THE MIDAS TOUCH.

10:22.392 --> 10:23.894
PRETTY SOON, YOUR PLACE
WILL BE TURNING PROFITS

10:23.894 --> 10:25.325
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.727
(chuckles)

10:28.128 --> 10:31.201
(Conrad) SO THE COMPLETE
GUEST LIST IS ON THIS...

10:32.733 --> 10:33.864
(Ashley) WHY?
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

10:33.864 --> 10:34.965
(Conrad) IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.036
(Ashley speaks indistinctly)

10:36.036 --> 10:37.738
OH, KARA. YOU'RE LEAVING?

10:37.738 --> 10:40.711
YEAH. TELL YOUR FOLKS
I SAID THANKS.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.172
(Daniel)
LISTEN, BEFORE YOU GO,

10:42.172 --> 10:43.744
I'VE GOT A QUESTION
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU.

10:43.744 --> 10:44.875
I DON'T MEAN
TO SOUND INSENSITIVE,

10:44.875 --> 10:46.817
BUT, UH...

10:46.817 --> 10:47.848
YOU WERE STILL MARRIED
TO DAVID CLARKE

10:47.848 --> 10:49.249
WHEN HE WENT TO WORK
FOR MY FATHER, RIGHT?

10:49.249 --> 10:50.751
YES.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.923
I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM
NOT TO MOVE US TO NEW YORK.

10:52.923 --> 10:55.355
THINGS MAY HAVE
WORKED OUT DIFFERENTLY.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.728
HE--HE KEEP ANY RECORDS
OF ANY PERSONAL INVESTMENTS

10:57.728 --> 10:59.960
HE MIGHT HAVE MADE
A-AFTER HE JOINED THE COMPANY...
 (doorbell rings)

10:59.960 --> 11:01.962
MAYBE FROM A JOINT ACCOUNT?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.964
THE MAN WAS DECEIVING
THE WHOLE WORLD.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.698
IF HE WANTED TO HIDE SOMETHING,
HE KNEW HOW TO DO IT.
 (door opens)

11:07.698 --> 11:09.339
DANIEL, KARA,
I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

11:09.339 --> 11:11.902
I WANTED TO LEAVE THIS
AT YOUR PARENTS' WEDDING

11:11.902 --> 11:13.243
BEFORE...

11:13.243 --> 11:16.306
THE WHOLE THING
WENT TO HELL?
 (sighs)

11:16.306 --> 11:17.808
MOM AND DAD
WILL BE VERY TOUCHED,

11:17.808 --> 11:19.679
ASSUMING IT'S NOT TICKING.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.052
(chuckles)

11:22.052 --> 11:24.715
I SEE THE POLICE DIDN'T HOLD
YOUR FATHER FOR LONG.

11:24.715 --> 11:26.356
I CAN'T IMAGINE
THE CHARGES WILL STICK.

11:26.356 --> 11:28.358
YEAH. CAN'T KEEP
A GOOD MAN DOWN.

11:28.358 --> 11:30.290
I'M GONNA BE LATE
FOR MY FLIGHT.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.723
AMANDA DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT YOU WERE LEAVING.

11:32.723 --> 11:35.695
NO, I'VE NEVER DONE WELL
WITH GOOD-BYES.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.799
HAVE I MISSED
A BON-VOYAGE PARTY?

11:38.799 --> 11:39.970
OH, I WAS JUST HEADING OUT.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.401
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.703
OH, WELL, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO YOUR CAR.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.776
HELLO, EMILY.

11:45.776 --> 11:46.837
VICTORIA...

11:46.837 --> 11:48.478
FOR YOU.

11:50.380 --> 11:53.383
OH, A WEDDING GIFT.

11:53.383 --> 11:54.885
HOW THOUGHTFUL.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.216
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TAKE THIS UPSTAIRS

11:56.216 --> 11:58.889
AND PUT IT WITH THE REST
OF THE UNOPENED GIFTS?

12:00.791 --> 12:03.153
I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
KARA.

12:03.153 --> 12:05.856
I KNOW AMANDA WILL FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

12:15.365 --> 12:17.267
THAT WOMAN'S HAD IT
PRETTY ROUGH.

12:17.267 --> 12:20.310
(door closes)
 WHOLE FAMILY HAS.

12:20.310 --> 12:22.873
YEAH.

12:22.873 --> 12:24.174
TAKE CARE, DANIEL.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.350
(door opens)

12:30.350 --> 12:32.953
(siren wailing in distance)

12:32.953 --> 12:34.124
(exhales)

12:34.124 --> 12:35.826
(clears throat)

12:35.826 --> 12:37.958
WHAT, IT WASN'T,
UH, ENOUGH

12:37.958 --> 12:40.831
TO PILFER MY ONLY FRIEND?

12:40.831 --> 12:42.462
NOW YOU WANT MY OFFICE, TOO?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.194
ON THE CONTRARY.

12:44.194 --> 12:46.496
I'D SAY EMILY
BELONGS TO YOU.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.939
HENCE, WHY I'M HERE.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.500
(telephone rings)

12:50.500 --> 12:52.943
(sighs)

12:52.943 --> 12:54.845
OKAY.

12:54.845 --> 12:56.446
I'M MOSTLY EARS.

12:56.446 --> 12:58.348
EMILY AND I
HAVE A PLAN IN MOTION

12:58.348 --> 13:00.250
TO INFILTRATE GRAYSON GLOBAL

13:00.250 --> 13:02.252
AND TO DRAW OUT THE INITIATIVE.

13:02.252 --> 13:04.955
THE PLAN
HINGES ON CONRAD'S OUSTER

13:04.955 --> 13:07.187
AND DANIEL'S ASCENSION
TO POWER.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.519
BUT FIRST,
TO GAIN LEGITIMACY,

13:09.519 --> 13:11.822
DANIEL MUST PROVE
THAT THEY OWN

13:11.822 --> 13:14.064
A MAJORITY STAKE
OF NOLCORP.

13:14.064 --> 13:16.867
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD FORK OVER

13:16.867 --> 13:20.230
MY LIFE'S WORK
TO THE AXIS OF EVIL, HMM?

13:20.230 --> 13:23.003
BECAUSE THIS MIGHT BE
OUR LAST CHANCE TO SAVE EMILY.

13:25.475 --> 13:27.878
EMILY DREW FUNDS
FROM A BURIED ACCOUNT.

13:27.878 --> 13:31.211
SHE'S BEEN CASHED OUT OF NOLCORP
SINCE I WENT PUBLIC IN 2006.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.343
WELL, THAT'S NOTHING THAT
A TEAM OF FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS

13:33.343 --> 13:35.345
WOULDN'T UNCOVER IF THEY STARTED
TO DIG DEEP ENOUGH.

13:35.345 --> 13:38.188
AND TRUST ME, ONCE GRAYSON'S
TEAM STARTS DIGGING,

13:38.188 --> 13:40.420
THEY WON'T STOP UNTIL
HE GETS WHAT HE'S AFTER,

13:40.420 --> 13:44.194
WHICH MEANS
EMILY'S FATE RESTS WITH YOU.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.833
(groans loudly)

13:53.833 --> 13:56.606
YOU'RE ASKING FOR PROOF
OF DAVID CLARKE'S

13:56.606 --> 13:58.838
ORIGINAL INVESTMENT?

13:58.838 --> 14:01.872
AND HERE IT IS.

14:01.872 --> 14:03.974
(closes drawer)

14:11.581 --> 14:14.324
ON RECORD,

14:14.324 --> 14:16.326
I AM ONLY DOING THIS
FOR EMILY

14:16.326 --> 14:19.159
BECAUSE HER FATHER ASKED ME
TO KEEP HER SAFE.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.392
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS...

14:22.392 --> 14:24.895
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

14:24.895 --> 14:29.369
WHAT IS SHE TO YOU...
EXACTLY?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.943
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO I
ONCE HURT VERY BADLY.

14:32.943 --> 14:34.945
AND NOW I'M TRYING
TO MAKE IT UP TO HER.

14:34.945 --> 14:36.606
WELL...

14:36.606 --> 14:38.578
HURT HER AGAIN,

14:38.578 --> 14:41.181
AND I SWEAR, YOU WILL PAY.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.485
UNDERSTOOD.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.998
(phone rings)

14:57.998 --> 14:59.199
(ring)

14:59.199 --> 15:00.670
(beep)
 AIDEN,
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

15:00.670 --> 15:03.003
ON MY WAY TO YOU WITH
DAVID CLARKE'S ORIGINAL CHECK

15:03.003 --> 15:04.204
TO NOLAN ROSS

15:04.204 --> 15:05.375
for Nolcorp's start-up funds.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.906
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.008
I THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT
SEIZED ALL HIS FINANCIALS.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.011
ONLY THE ONES
THAT THEY COULD FIND.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.043
THE PLAYERS
ARE LINED UP, DANNY.

15:13.043 --> 15:15.085
TIME TO STRIKE.

15:15.085 --> 15:16.386
ARE YOU IN?

15:16.386 --> 15:18.288
I'M IN.
 (beep)

15:18.288 --> 15:19.619
IN FOR WHAT, DANIEL?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.051
WE'RE TAKING OVER
THE COMPANY.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.193
NOW LISTEN, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO KEEP MY FATHER OCCUPIED

15:23.193 --> 15:24.354
WHILE I ASSEMBLE

15:24.354 --> 15:25.525
THE POWER PLAYERS
THIS AFTERNOON.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.696
NO PROBLEM,

15:26.696 --> 15:28.999
BUT ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN TRUST AIDEN?

15:28.999 --> 15:29.960
HE'S GIVEN ME
NO REASON NOT TO.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.401
JUST KEEP MY DAD
IN THE SPOTLIGHT

15:31.401 --> 15:32.562
AFTER HIS SPEECH

15:32.562 --> 15:34.104
AND AWAY FROM THE LIBRARY.

15:34.104 --> 15:35.565
IF I CAN PERSUADE
OUR KEY INVESTORS TO BACK ME,

15:35.565 --> 15:37.237
I'M GONNA CALL FOR A VOTE
OF NO CONFIDENCE

15:37.237 --> 15:39.309
ON MY FATHER NEXT WEEK.
 (knock on door)

15:39.309 --> 15:41.011
DANIEL, A WORD?

15:41.011 --> 15:41.972
DON'T MIND ME.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.117
(door closes)
 I COULDN'T HELP
OVERHEARING YOU ASK KARA

15:47.117 --> 15:49.119
ABOUT DAVID CLARKE'S
INVESTMENTS.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.450
COULDN'T YOU?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.621
LAST SPRING,
YOU WERE SO VEHEMENT

15:51.621 --> 15:53.153
AGAINST MY TESTIFYING
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.025
I'D HAVE THOUGHT
THAT PLANE CRASH

15:55.025 --> 15:57.087
WOULD'VE PUT ALL THAT INTRIGUE
BEHIND YOU.

15:57.087 --> 15:58.588
WHAT'S
THE SUDDEN RE-INTEREST?

15:58.588 --> 16:00.130
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

16:00.130 --> 16:01.531
WHY DID YOU INVITE HIS WIFE
TO STAY WITH US?

16:01.531 --> 16:03.433
MUST HAVE BEEN AWKWARD FOR HER,
SLEEPING IN THE SAME HOUSE

16:03.433 --> 16:05.465
WITH THE HOME WRECKER
WHO BORE HIS CHILD.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.337

16:07.337 --> 16:09.139
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO START FOCUSING

16:09.139 --> 16:11.441
ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PROCEED
IF YOUR FATHER STANDS TRIAL.

16:11.441 --> 16:12.972
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO PROCEED?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.404
WILL YOU BE
STANDING BY YOUR MAN,

16:14.404 --> 16:16.106
OR WAS THAT VOW AS FAKE
AS THE REST?

16:16.106 --> 16:20.110
THAT'S ENTIRELY MY BUSINESS.

16:20.110 --> 16:23.513
NOW UNDERSTAND SOMETHING,
DANIEL.

16:23.513 --> 16:25.455
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

16:25.455 --> 16:28.088
YOUR STRONGEST ADVOCATE.

17:27.416 --> 17:30.580
HAS BEEN EVER SINCE
THE FIRST DAY AT ALLENWOOD.

18:36.316 --> 18:40.119
(instrumental jazz playing,
indistinct conversations)

18:40.119 --> 18:41.421
(Conrad) HELEN.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.393
WELCOME TO MY HOME.

18:43.393 --> 18:45.395
CONRAD, YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

18:45.395 --> 18:46.896
WE'RE ALL SENDING
GOOD THOUGHTS YOUR WAY

18:46.896 --> 18:48.528
REGARDING THE ARRAIGNMENT
TOMORROW.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.300
OH, I DO APPRECIATE THAT.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.302
HELEN CROWLEY,
MY WIFE VICTORIA.

18:52.302 --> 18:56.306
HELEN IS ONE OF
OUR LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS.

18:56.306 --> 18:57.707
PLEASURE.

18:57.707 --> 18:58.868
FOR ME AS WELL.

18:58.868 --> 19:00.910
I'VE HEARD SO MANY THINGS.

19:00.910 --> 19:02.242
EXCUSE ME.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.574
(lowered voice) WE'LL SPEAK
PRIVATELY BEFORE I GO,

19:04.574 --> 19:06.446
AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD
TO MEETING

19:06.446 --> 19:08.818
YOUR RECENT HOUSEGUEST.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.852
SHE'S ONE OF THEM,
ISN'T SHE?

19:12.852 --> 19:14.354
IN THE FLESH.

19:19.689 --> 19:21.931
OUR FUTURE. HMM?

19:23.493 --> 19:27.497
I'LL GET MR. GRAYSON
READY FOR HIS SPEECH.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.602
THE GUY CLEANS UP WELL.

19:32.602 --> 19:34.744
SO...

19:34.744 --> 19:37.207
HOW SERIOUS WAS IT...

19:37.207 --> 19:39.209
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

19:39.209 --> 19:41.211
I'M NOT GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AIDEN, NOLAN.

19:41.211 --> 19:43.883
OH. LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR MOM.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.385
ARE YOU REALLY READY
TO LET HER DISAPPEAR AGAIN

19:45.385 --> 19:47.557
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT
WE WENT THROUGH TO FIND HER?

19:47.557 --> 19:49.619
IT'S SAFER FOR HER THIS WAY.

19:49.619 --> 19:50.960
SHE USED
VICTORIA'S CREDIT CARD

19:50.960 --> 19:52.762
TO BOOK A FLIGHT
TO COLORADO SPRINGS.

19:52.762 --> 19:53.893
AND... YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.965
I'VE BEEN TRACKING
HER ONLINE TRANSACTIONS.

19:55.965 --> 19:56.926
OH.

19:56.926 --> 19:59.198
WHEN EVERYTHING SETTLES DOWN,

19:59.198 --> 20:00.970
I SHOULD KNOW
WHERE TO FIND HER.

20:00.970 --> 20:01.931
(cell phone rings)

20:01.931 --> 20:04.404
(ring)

20:04.404 --> 20:07.277
(ring, beep)

20:07.277 --> 20:08.878
JACK.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.311
HI. I...

20:11.311 --> 20:13.613
HEAR CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.784
Yeah.

20:14.784 --> 20:16.386
YEAH, USUALLY
YOU HAVE THE WEDDING

20:16.386 --> 20:18.288
BEFORE THE BABY, BUT...
(chuckles)

20:18.288 --> 20:19.989
(lowered voice)
CONGRATULATIONS?

20:21.791 --> 20:26.225
WELL, SOMETIMES IT'S BEST
WHEN THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.828
I'M SURE YOU TWO
WILL BE VERY HAPPY.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.860
US THREE.

20:30.860 --> 20:34.504
THANKS, EMILY.
UH, LISTEN...

20:34.504 --> 20:36.906
I HAVE A WEIRD QUESTION.
DO YOU--

20:36.906 --> 20:39.839
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
MASON TREADWELL'S PHONE NUMBER?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.511
Amanda went over to
his place earlier for lunch,

20:41.511 --> 20:43.413
but she should be back by now
to take over baby duty.

20:43.413 --> 20:44.744
I gotta get behind the bar.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.245
NO, I DON'T,

20:46.245 --> 20:47.747
BUT IF I HEAR FROM HER,
I'LL LET HER KNOW YOU CALLED.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.878
All right. Thank you.

20:48.878 --> 20:50.249
OKAY. BYE.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.421
(beep)

20:51.421 --> 20:53.653
JACK AND AMANDA
ARE GETTING MARRIED?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.655
EMS, EMS, THAT IS HUGE.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.387
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MAKE PLANS
THIS AFTERNOON,

20:57.387 --> 21:00.430
BECAUSE I'M GONNA NEED YOU.

21:00.430 --> 21:01.961
(sighs)
 (door opens)

21:01.961 --> 21:05.535
SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.670
SO THIS IS IT.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.971
ALL YOUR RESEARCH.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.703
EVERY WORD,

21:13.703 --> 21:16.846
EVERY IMAGE, EVERY SYLLABLE
OF MY INVESTIGATION.

21:16.846 --> 21:19.749
AMANDA, I WANT YOU TO KNOW

21:19.749 --> 21:21.581
THAT I DEEPLY REGRET
THE ROLE I PLAYED

21:21.581 --> 21:23.282
IN YOUR FATHER'S DEMISE.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.754
THIS NEXT BOOK WILL NOT ONLY
CLEAR HIS NAME,

21:24.754 --> 21:27.917
BUT ALSO PORTRAY YOU
AS A VICTIM OF YOUR STALKER--

21:27.917 --> 21:31.361
MS. EMILY THORNE,
THE SOCIOPATHIC SOCIALITE.

21:32.962 --> 21:37.026
IT'S A RELIEF
TO FINALLY TELL SOMEONE.

21:37.026 --> 21:39.068
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

21:39.068 --> 21:40.970
OH, CONFESSION, THEY SAY

21:40.970 --> 21:43.973
IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL...

21:43.973 --> 21:45.735
AND FOR BOOK SALES.

21:45.735 --> 21:48.978
NOW, UH, GETTING BACK
TO YOUR DAYS

21:48.978 --> 21:50.580
WORKING AT THAT DESCRIPTIVELY
NAMED GENTLEMAN'S CLUB,

21:50.580 --> 21:52.912
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING THAT

21:52.912 --> 21:55.044
YOUR LAST SPIN
ON THE DANCE POLE

21:55.044 --> 21:57.316
COINCIDED WITH THE MURDER
OF FRANK STEVENS.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.819
NOW MY THEORY IS THAT EMILY
ALERTED YOU TO THE DANGER,

21:59.819 --> 22:02.552
THEN HAD SOMEONE
DISPATCH HIM?

22:02.552 --> 22:05.054
SHE'S UNHINGED.

22:05.054 --> 22:06.856
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT SHE MIGHT DO

22:06.856 --> 22:08.458
WHEN HER BACK'S
UP AGAINST THE WALL.

22:08.458 --> 22:11.461
INCLUDING BASHING IN
A MAN'S SKULL?

22:11.461 --> 22:12.802
SHE'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

22:12.802 --> 22:14.003
AMANDA, NO!

22:14.003 --> 22:16.536
(grunts and pants)

22:16.536 --> 22:18.408
(grunts)
 GIVE IT TO ME!

22:18.408 --> 22:19.809
GO HOME.
 HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

22:19.809 --> 22:21.340
DON'T YOU SEE?
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.712
(pants)

22:22.712 --> 22:25.575
CHOOSE YOUR FAMILY.

22:25.575 --> 22:27.677
(panting)

22:27.677 --> 22:29.479
YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.

22:32.922 --> 22:34.524
(door slams)

22:38.528 --> 22:40.490
SO I WAS RIGHT.

22:40.490 --> 22:43.733
YOU REALLY ARE THE BRAINS
IN THIS MACHIAVELLIAN SCHEME.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.095
YOU WERE THIS CLOSE,
MASON.

22:46.095 --> 22:47.937
BUT YOU MISSED
THE ONE THING

22:47.937 --> 22:51.571
THAT'S BEEN RIGHT UNDER
YOUR NOSE THE WHOLE TIME.

22:51.571 --> 22:54.143
SHE'S NOT AMANDA CLARKE.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.947
YOU ARE.

22:57.947 --> 23:00.410
HMM.

23:07.517 --> 23:08.888
AFTER MY FATHER WAS ARRESTED,

23:08.888 --> 23:10.760
YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON
I COULD TRUST.

23:13.663 --> 23:15.124
I BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID

23:15.124 --> 23:17.897
THAT YOU'D WRITE
THE REAL STORY.

23:22.632 --> 23:27.577
YOU HAD THE POWER
TO CHANGE MY FUTURE...

23:27.577 --> 23:30.109
AND MY FATHER'S.

23:30.109 --> 23:34.083
AND WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS
MY REGRETS.

23:34.083 --> 23:38.417
NO. WORDS, MASON, ARE EXACTLY
THE WEAPON THAT YOU CHOSE.

23:38.417 --> 23:43.092
EVERYTHING
THAT I HAVE BECOME...

23:43.092 --> 23:44.754
AND EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE GIVEN UP

23:44.754 --> 23:47.527
IS BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID
TO MY FATHER...

23:47.527 --> 23:48.998
AND WHAT YOU

23:48.998 --> 23:50.830
FAILED TO DO FOR HIM.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.002
IF I COULD REDRESS
THE BALANCE...

23:53.002 --> 23:54.834
(cell phone rings)

23:54.834 --> 23:56.836
(ring)

23:56.836 --> 23:58.137
(ring)

23:58.137 --> 23:59.208
JUST IN TIME.

23:59.208 --> 24:00.870
(ring, beep)

24:00.870 --> 24:02.041
YOU CLOSE?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.773
IS WHO CLOSE?

24:03.773 --> 24:05.475
OH, I'M ON MY WAY,

24:05.475 --> 24:06.876
BUT I'VE GOT SOME BAD NEWS,
I THINK.

24:06.876 --> 24:09.779
GUESS WHO JUST DITCHED
HER FLIGHT AT J.F.K.

24:09.779 --> 24:12.522
and just rented a car
on Victoria's credit card.

24:12.522 --> 24:13.823
Your mother's gone rogue.

24:13.823 --> 24:15.525
(sighs) DAMN IT.

24:15.525 --> 24:17.787
Do you want me to stay here
or stick to the plan?

24:17.787 --> 24:19.228
STICK TO THE PLAN.

24:19.228 --> 24:20.590
(beep)

24:22.532 --> 24:25.995
TIME TO START MAKING AMENDS,
MASON.

24:25.995 --> 24:29.799
(cell phone rings)

24:29.799 --> 24:30.970
WHO IS THIS?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.542
Kara, it's Mason Treadwell.

24:32.542 --> 24:36.546
I HAVE URGENT INFORMATION ABOUT
THE MURDER OF GORDON MURPHY.

24:36.546 --> 24:38.477
HOW'D YOU GET
THIS NUMBER?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.809
Your husband gave it to me.

24:39.809 --> 24:43.012
I'll meet you at Bel-Aire Cove
in 30 minutes.

24:45.014 --> 24:46.816
(receiver clatters)

24:46.816 --> 24:48.818
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS
MY GRATITUDE

24:48.818 --> 24:50.660
FOR YOUR UNWAVERING SUPPORT

24:50.660 --> 24:53.262
THROUGH THESE
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TIMES.

24:53.262 --> 24:54.894
LISTEN, A MAN IN MY POSITION

24:54.894 --> 24:56.966
CAN'T HELP BUT GENERATE
POWERFUL ENEMIES,

24:56.966 --> 24:58.598
WHICH IS
THE ONLY SOUND EXPLANATION

24:58.598 --> 25:02.772
FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS
CONSTANTLY HURLED MY WAY.

25:02.772 --> 25:04.774
SO GET USED TO IT,
BECAUSE IN THE COMING MONTHS

25:04.774 --> 25:06.606
WHEN THE DUST SETTLES,

25:06.606 --> 25:08.237
I ASSURE YOU, THE ONLY THING
MAKING HEADLINES

25:08.237 --> 25:11.781
WILL BE THE ALCHEMY BEHIND
YOUR RISING PORTFOLIOS.
 (guests murmuring)

25:11.781 --> 25:15.885
NOW VICTORIA AND I ARE HONORED
TO HAVE YOU AT OUR HOME,

25:15.885 --> 25:18.918
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ALLAYING
ANY CONCERNS

25:18.918 --> 25:20.890
YOU MAY HAVE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:20.890 --> 25:23.853
CONRAD,
YOU PROMISED A Q&A.

25:23.853 --> 25:25.294
YES, OF COURSE.

25:25.294 --> 25:26.896
PERFECT.

25:26.896 --> 25:30.299
HOW DID YOU KNOW GORDON?

25:30.299 --> 25:32.932
SUCH AN ENIGMA OF A MAN.
COULD ANYONE REALLY KNOW

25:32.932 --> 25:34.103
Gordon Murphy?

25:34.103 --> 25:35.304
CUT TO THE CHASE, MASON.

25:35.304 --> 25:36.906
Show her the pocket watch.

25:36.906 --> 25:41.010
THIS CAME INTO MY POSSESSION
FROM A POLICE FRIEND.

25:41.010 --> 25:43.743
HOWEVER MISUNDERSTOOD
HE WAS,

25:43.743 --> 25:46.075
CLEARLY YOU AND GORDON
SHARED A DEEP CONNECTION.

25:46.075 --> 25:47.947
IF YOU INTEND
TO HONOR HIS MEMORY,

25:47.947 --> 25:50.880
YOU MUST GO AS FAR AWAY
FROM HERE

25:50.880 --> 25:55.585
AND THESE... PEOPLE
AS POSSIBLE.

25:55.585 --> 25:58.988
THAT IS WHAT HE WANTED
FOR YOU, IS IT NOT?

26:00.760 --> 26:01.931
YES.

26:01.931 --> 26:03.893
THEN YOU MUST GO, KARA.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.039
BUT BEFORE YOU DO,
THERE IS ONE MORE THING

26:10.039 --> 26:12.271
THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR FIRST LOVE.

26:14.043 --> 26:17.647
David Clarke
didn't lie to you.

26:17.647 --> 26:19.078
He was a victim as well.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.050
MASON, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

26:21.050 --> 26:22.612
PENANCE. ISN'T THIS
WHAT YOU WANTED?

26:22.612 --> 26:24.784
WHAT? I DON'T--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.686
20 years ago,
a book I wrote

26:26.686 --> 26:27.987
about your first husband

26:27.987 --> 26:29.689
depicted him
as a calculating villain

26:29.689 --> 26:31.791
when in fact,
he was an innocent man...

26:31.791 --> 26:33.663
MASON, STOP.
SHE'S NOT READY TO HEAR THIS.

26:33.663 --> 26:35.064
whose only crime

26:35.064 --> 26:36.195
WAS TO RUN AFOUL
OF SOME VERY POWERFUL,

26:36.195 --> 26:37.897
VERY MALIGNANT PEOPLE.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.999
Mason, she's off her medication.
She's unstable.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.330
THE GRAYSONS.

26:41.330 --> 26:44.333
YES. THEY PAID ME
TO PERPETUATE THEIR LIES.

26:46.335 --> 26:48.107
MASON, STOP HER.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.339
Wait!
My story isn't finished.

26:50.339 --> 26:52.011
(grunts)

26:52.011 --> 26:54.013
(sighs)

26:54.013 --> 26:55.384
(cell phone beeps, auto-dials)

26:55.384 --> 26:57.817
(phone rings)

26:57.817 --> 26:58.988
(click)
 (Aiden) Leave a message.

26:58.988 --> 27:00.289
(beep)

27:00.289 --> 27:02.391
AIDEN, MY MOTHER'S ON HER WAY
BACK TO THE GRAYSONS',

27:02.391 --> 27:03.953
AND SHE'S OUT FOR BLOOD.

27:03.953 --> 27:05.624
KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.396
(cell phone beeps
and clatters)
 (under breath) DAMN IT.

27:07.396 --> 27:09.659
(Daniel)
AS OUR MOST IMPORTANT CLIENTS,

27:09.659 --> 27:10.960
I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU,
IF NOT ALL,

27:10.960 --> 27:12.662
ARE PLANNING TO PULL
YOUR INVESTMENT

27:12.662 --> 27:14.363
IN GRAYSON GLOBAL TOMORROW.

27:14.363 --> 27:17.066
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING
THE REST OF THE WORLD DOES NOT.

27:17.066 --> 27:19.068
OUR FIRM
IS ACTUALLY UNDERVALUED

27:19.068 --> 27:21.911
BY AS MUCH AS 50%.

27:21.911 --> 27:23.172
AS I'VE RECENTLY DISCOVERED,

27:23.172 --> 27:25.174
GRAYSON GLOBAL HAS
AN INDISPUTABLE

27:25.174 --> 27:27.016
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR STAKE

27:27.016 --> 27:30.119
IN NOLCORP SOFTWARE
AND ELECTRONICS--

27:30.119 --> 27:31.420
A FACT MY FATHER
HAS EITHER BEEN COUCHING

27:31.420 --> 27:33.953
OR OBLIVIOUS TO
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS.

27:36.726 --> 27:38.057
IF YOU'LL CONSIDER ME

27:38.057 --> 27:40.059
AS A REPLACEMENT TO MY FATHER
AS C.E.O.,

27:40.059 --> 27:42.261
I WILL GUARANTEE
THIS COMPANY'S SOLVENCY,

27:42.261 --> 27:44.934
AND UNDER MY LEADERSHIP,
WE WILL MOVE ON NOLCORP

27:44.934 --> 27:48.397
AND TRIPLE OUR NET WORTH
INSIDE A YEAR.

27:48.397 --> 27:51.200
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.464
(whistles)

28:15.464 --> 28:19.999
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

28:19.999 --> 28:23.002
(beeping)

28:29.208 --> 28:30.940
(beeping continues)

28:33.042 --> 28:35.384
(woman) HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO RUN YOUR COMPANY FROM PRISON?

28:35.384 --> 28:37.847
I ASSURE YOU,
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

28:37.847 --> 28:40.319
LOOK, EVEN IF THERE IS A TRIAL,

28:40.319 --> 28:42.251
I'M PREPARED TO APPOINT
AN INTERIM LEADERSHIP

28:42.251 --> 28:45.194
TO NAVIGATE THE DAY-TO-DAY
UNTIL I'M ACQUITTED. SO...

28:45.194 --> 28:47.056
(guests murmuring)

28:47.056 --> 28:49.829
(lowered voice)
THIS IS A DISASTER.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.360
WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYONE?
WHERE'S MY SON?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.731
I HAVE NO IDEA--

28:52.731 --> 28:54.033
MR. GRAYSON.
 YES.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.765
MRS. GRAYSON NEEDS TO SPEAK
WITH YOU IN HER SUITE.

28:55.765 --> 28:56.936
IT'S URGENT.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.938
EXCUSE ME.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.210
(indistinct conversations)

29:01.210 --> 29:03.843
CONRAD, I HAVE BAD NEWS.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.144
OH, YES.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.917
THAT DOES
SEEM TO BE GOING AROUND.

29:07.917 --> 29:09.218
SHUT THE DOOR.

29:35.244 --> 29:38.347
KARA, WHATEVER DEMONS
YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH,

29:38.347 --> 29:40.880
WE CAN GET YOU
THE BEST HELP POSSIBLE.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.511
THE ONLY DEMONS
I'M STRUGGLING WITH

29:42.511 --> 29:45.184
ARE STANDING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

29:45.184 --> 29:48.557
I WANT A CONFESSION.

29:48.557 --> 29:52.021
YOU CAN START BY TELLING ME
WHAT YOU DID TO DAVID.

29:52.021 --> 29:53.492
YOU WERE NEVER IN LOVE WITH HIM,
WERE YOU?

29:53.492 --> 29:55.925
OH, NO. SHE WAS. SHE WAS
VERY MUCH. I MEAN, TOO MUCH.

29:55.925 --> 29:58.097
I WANT TO HEAR IT...
 KARA.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.228
FROM HER.

29:59.228 --> 30:01.300
VICTORIA HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO DAVID.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.472
IT WAS ALL ME.

30:03.472 --> 30:05.274
CONRAD...
 NO, NO, NO.

30:05.274 --> 30:07.336
LOOK, I MADE A DEAL

30:07.336 --> 30:09.979
WITH SOME NEFARIOUS PEOPLE
WHO HAD EVERY INTENTION

30:09.979 --> 30:12.181
OF FRAMING ME
FOR THAT PLANE GOING DOWN.

30:12.181 --> 30:13.582
SO YOU BLAMED IT
ON DAVID?

30:13.582 --> 30:15.314
THE MAN WAS STEALING MY WIFE.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.887
YEAH, I WANTED HIM TO FEEL
THE SAME LEVEL OF PAIN

30:17.887 --> 30:20.019
THAT HE'D INFLICTED ON ME.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.122
COME ON. YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.129
AND--AND I'M SORRY TO SAY

30:30.129 --> 30:33.032
THAT YOUR DAVID
WAS A VERY TRUSTING MAN,

30:33.032 --> 30:35.234
WHICH MADE THE THING...

30:35.234 --> 30:36.405
IT WAS ALMOST CHILD'S PLAY.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.509
LOOKING FOR THIS?

30:42.471 --> 30:44.213
GET IN THE DRESSING ROOM.

30:44.213 --> 30:46.916
BOTH OF YOU.

30:46.916 --> 30:48.878
(camera shutter clicking,
police radio chatter)

30:48.878 --> 30:51.120
(door squeaks)

30:52.581 --> 30:55.254
GENTLEMEN,
MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.887
WE HAVE A WARRANT,
MR. TREADWELL.

30:57.887 --> 31:01.230
WE NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT
THE MURDER OF GORDON MURPHY

31:01.230 --> 31:04.333
AS WELL AS THE CONSPIRACY
TO FRAME CONRAD GRAYSON.

31:06.035 --> 31:07.566
CONSPIRACY INDEED.

31:07.566 --> 31:11.370
(radio chatter continues)

31:11.370 --> 31:14.103
DETECTIVE GUNTHER?

31:21.280 --> 31:24.553
(speaking indistinctly)

31:31.590 --> 31:33.592
(continues
speaking indistinctly)

31:33.592 --> 31:36.325
(cell phone rings)

31:36.325 --> 31:38.427
(ring, beep)

31:38.427 --> 31:41.030
(Emily) Why the hell haven't you
been answering your phone?

31:41.030 --> 31:42.601
IS SHE THERE?
 Yeah.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.133
SHE STANDING 10 FEET
AWAY FROM ME.

31:44.133 --> 31:46.405
HER NAME'S HELEN CROWLEY.
EMILY,

31:46.405 --> 31:47.906
we've just made contact
with the Initiative.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.979
I'M TALKING ABOUT MY MOTHER.

31:49.979 --> 31:52.381
SHE NEVER GOT ON THAT PLANE.
SHE'S COMING FOR THE GRAYSONS.

31:52.381 --> 31:53.542
You have to stop her.

31:53.542 --> 31:55.184
BLOODY HELL.
WELL, WHERE IS SHE?

31:55.184 --> 31:56.915
I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T...
 (clicking keys)

31:56.915 --> 32:00.189
I CAN'T FIND HER
OR VICTORIA AND CONRAD.

32:00.189 --> 32:01.490
WAIT.

32:01.490 --> 32:04.923
(beeping,
keys continue clicking)

32:04.923 --> 32:08.097
A HALF A DOZEN CAMERAS
HAVE BEEN DISABLED.

32:08.097 --> 32:09.358
She's got them
in Victoria's bedroom.

32:09.358 --> 32:11.030
Second floor,
end of the hall.

32:13.202 --> 32:14.333
Switch the rest of them off.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.504
AIDEN...

32:15.504 --> 32:17.206
(pants)

32:17.206 --> 32:20.409
Trust me.

32:20.409 --> 32:23.342
(typing)

32:23.342 --> 32:26.275
(beeping)

32:26.275 --> 32:28.547
(exhales)

32:28.547 --> 32:31.620
PUT THESE ON.

32:31.620 --> 32:34.153
MAKE NO MISTAKE, KARA.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.585
AFTER DAVID'S ARREST,
THERE WAS NO RELIEF.

32:36.585 --> 32:39.128
AND AFTER HIS CONVICTION,
THERE WAS ONLY GUILT.

32:39.128 --> 32:40.559
WHAT,
SO YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE

32:40.559 --> 32:42.491
THAT IT WOULD BE TOO MERCIFUL
TO KILL YOU?

32:42.491 --> 32:44.093
THERE ARE FAR MORE INSIDIOUS
FORCES AT WORK HERE.

32:44.093 --> 32:45.264
SHUT UP!

32:45.264 --> 32:46.435
THE PEOPLE WHO BLEW UP
FLIGHT 1-9-7--

32:46.435 --> 32:47.566
THEY KILLED DAVID.

32:47.566 --> 32:50.169
TO BE MORE SPECIFIC,
GORDON DID.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.340
LIAR.

32:51.340 --> 32:52.501
IT'S TRUE. THERE'S PROOF--

32:52.501 --> 32:54.973
A TORN PICTURE OF DAVID
ON THE DAY HE DIED.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.405
I SAW THE PHOTOGRAPH.
IT PROVES NOTHING.

32:56.405 --> 32:59.048
WELL, THEN YOU DIDN'T SEE
BOTH HALVES.

32:59.048 --> 33:00.609
LOOK IN THE LINING
OF MY JEWELRY BOX.

33:02.611 --> 33:04.553
TURN AROUND.

33:16.365 --> 33:17.696
GORDON.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.498
(Victoria)
HE MURDERED DAVID, KARA.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.431
NO, NO. NO, NO.

33:22.431 --> 33:23.402
HE COULDN'T.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.734
HE DID. AND SO MUCH MORE.
HE WAS ONE OF THEM.

33:25.734 --> 33:27.406
HE WAS THE WORST OF THEM.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.707
SHUT UP!
 (loud clatter)

33:28.707 --> 33:30.339
KNEEL DOWN!

33:30.339 --> 33:32.211
THE BLINDFOLDS!

33:32.211 --> 33:34.113
PUT THEM ON.
PUT THEM ON NOW.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.799
I'M SORRY, VICTORIA.

33:55.104 --> 33:57.136
(muffled grunt)

34:03.172 --> 34:05.214
(sniffs)

34:05.214 --> 34:06.815
MM.

34:06.815 --> 34:09.148
(grunts)
 IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE SAFE.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.620
WHAT, YOU--YOU GRABBED ME?

34:11.620 --> 34:13.581
NO.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.224
AGENT MATHIS DID.

34:15.224 --> 34:16.824
HOW ARE YOU INVOLVED?

34:16.824 --> 34:20.329
I'M AFRAID I BROUGHT HER
INTO THIS.

34:20.329 --> 34:22.491
I SNUCK YOU OFF THE ESTATE
DOWN THE BEACH PATH,

34:22.491 --> 34:24.793
AND, UH, MS. THORNE
WAS THERE.

34:24.793 --> 34:26.395
HE SHOWED ME HIS BADGE.

34:26.395 --> 34:29.098
I CHECKED WITH THE BUREAU.
HE'S LEGITIMATE.

34:29.098 --> 34:30.339
THESE PILLS--

34:30.339 --> 34:33.601
THEY WERE, UM,
FOUND ON YOUR HUSBAND,

34:33.601 --> 34:36.275
BUT THERE WAS NO TRACE
OF MEDICATION IN HIS SYSTEM,

34:36.275 --> 34:39.277
SO, UM, THEY'RE YOURS,
AREN'T THEY?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.210
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE ASHAMED.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.181
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO CAN HELP YOU.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.353
AND UNFORTUNATELY,

34:44.353 --> 34:46.355
THE PEOPLE
THAT GORDON WORKED FOR

34:46.355 --> 34:47.485
HAVE YOU IN THEIR CROSSHAIRS.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.358
WHATEVER PLANS YOU HAD
FOR THE GRAYSONS

34:49.358 --> 34:51.620
WOULD LIKELY END UP GETTING YOU
KILLED IF YOU HAD STAYED.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.322
MY ONLY PLAN
FOR THE GRAYSONS

34:53.322 --> 34:55.594
WAS TO SCARE THEM
INTO TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.795
THERE'S, UM... (clears throat)
 (pills rattle)

34:56.795 --> 34:58.427
THERE'S A CAR,
A FULL TANK OF GAS,

34:58.427 --> 35:00.429
AND SOME MONEY
TO GET YOU STARTED.

35:00.429 --> 35:02.131
(keys rattle)

35:02.131 --> 35:04.133
YOU'RE NOT TAKING ME IN?

35:04.133 --> 35:06.535
(sighs) NOT IF YOU PROMISE
NEVER TO RETURN.

35:06.535 --> 35:09.278
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE YOURSELF

35:09.278 --> 35:12.541
AND... YOUR DAUGHTER.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.515
BEST OF LUCK.

35:16.515 --> 35:21.420
(footsteps retreat)

35:22.851 --> 35:24.893
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

35:26.795 --> 35:30.759
WELL, JUST...
KEEP YOURSELF SAFE.

35:35.904 --> 35:38.307
KARA, IS THERE...

35:38.307 --> 35:41.840
ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT ME
TO TELL AMANDA?

35:43.312 --> 35:45.474
(sighs)

35:48.447 --> 35:52.421
JUST TELL HER I WISH
I COULD'VE BEEN A BETTER MOTHER.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.455
(door closes)

36:04.463 --> 36:06.365
♪ HEY ♪

36:06.365 --> 36:09.298
♪ HEY,
MY LITTLE GIRL CHILD ♪

36:09.298 --> 36:12.201
♪ OUT IN THE WINTER ♪

36:12.201 --> 36:14.303
♪ OUT IN THE WILD ♪

36:32.421 --> 36:33.422
(Aiden grunts)

36:33.422 --> 36:35.394
(door closes, engine starts)
 (clears throat)

36:35.394 --> 36:37.566
I CAN...
 (car departs)

36:37.566 --> 36:40.869
I CAN STAY IF--IF YOU WANT.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

36:40.869 --> 36:43.932
NO, YOU GO.

36:43.932 --> 36:47.336
I HAVE ONE MORE LOOSE END
TO TIE UP.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.379
OKAY.

36:53.642 --> 36:56.315
(door closes)

36:57.716 --> 36:59.548
(Padma) I'M ASSUMING WE'VE GOT
WORKMAN'S COMP, RIGHT?

36:59.548 --> 37:01.450
PADMA.

37:01.450 --> 37:02.951
YOU OKAY?

37:02.951 --> 37:04.923
I FIGURED
I'D KICK OFF MY SHOES,

37:04.923 --> 37:07.826
GET COMFY,
STAB MYSELF ON YOUR RUG.
 (chuckles)

37:07.826 --> 37:09.358
DID YOU BREAK A GLASS?

37:10.829 --> 37:13.462
SOMETHING WRONG?

37:13.462 --> 37:15.434
WOULD YOU STILL WANT ME

37:15.434 --> 37:19.237
IF I WASN'T NOLAN ROSS?

37:19.237 --> 37:20.539
BECAUSE TOMORROW,

37:20.539 --> 37:23.011
HE MAY CEASE TO EXIST
AS YOU KNOW HIM.

37:23.011 --> 37:25.714
CONDITIONS CHANGE,
BUT YOU CAN'T.

37:25.714 --> 37:27.676
MM. I DON'T KNOW.

37:27.676 --> 37:30.719
I HATE FEET,
AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

37:30.719 --> 37:33.282
I AM.

37:33.282 --> 37:35.384
AND...

37:35.384 --> 37:36.755
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

37:36.755 --> 37:40.729
I'LL ALWAYS SEE YOU
AS NOLAN ALGERNON ROSS.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.794
(whispers)
MY MIDDLE NAME'S MITCHELL.

37:45.794 --> 37:47.966
(whispers)
I GAVE IT A SHOT.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.439
(door opens)

37:50.439 --> 37:51.400
I TOLD YOU,

37:51.400 --> 37:52.901
I'M NOT GOING TO ANSWER
A SINGLE QUESTION

37:52.901 --> 37:55.304
UNTIL I SPEAK TO MY LAWYER.

37:55.304 --> 37:57.746
NO LAWYER'S GONNA
HELP YOU NOW, MASON.

37:57.746 --> 37:58.907
(chair scrapes floor)

37:58.907 --> 38:00.949
WELL, WELL, WELL...

38:00.949 --> 38:02.651
(chair scrapes)

38:02.651 --> 38:04.953
IF ISN'T
BENEDICT CLARKE.

38:04.953 --> 38:07.586
YOU MUST BE PROUD
OF YOURSELF--

38:07.586 --> 38:11.520
LULLING ME INTO COMPLACENCY
ONLY TO DOUBLE-CROSS ME.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.922
I'M ALMOST FLATTERED
THE POLICE THINK ME CAPABLE

38:13.922 --> 38:16.525
OF SUCH A BYZANTINE SCHEME TO
BRING DOWN A GOVERNMENT PLANE,

38:16.525 --> 38:17.866
MURDER MY ACCOMPLICE,

38:17.866 --> 38:21.530
THEN FRAME AN INNOCENT TYCOON
FOR THE CRIME.

38:21.530 --> 38:24.473
I ASSUME YOU'RE HERE
TO GLOAT.

38:24.473 --> 38:25.974
(exhales)

38:25.974 --> 38:29.438
I'M HERE TO MAKE A DEAL.

38:29.438 --> 38:31.680
THE NEXT TIME DETECTIVE GUNTHER
WALKS IN THAT DOOR,

38:31.680 --> 38:34.883
YOU'RE GOING TO WAIVE
YOUR RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.

38:34.883 --> 38:37.586
YOU WILL GO TO PRISON
FOR CRIMES YOU DIDN'T COMMIT,

38:37.586 --> 38:40.889
INCLUDING DOWNING THAT PLANE,
JUST LIKE MY FATHER DID.

38:40.889 --> 38:43.552
ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,

38:43.552 --> 38:44.693
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE
A FULL CONFESSION

38:44.693 --> 38:46.395
SO THAT WE CAN AVOID
A TRIAL.

38:46.395 --> 38:47.556
(chuckles)

38:47.556 --> 38:50.499
THAT'S SOME DEAL.

38:50.499 --> 38:51.630
I THINK I'LL PASS.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.862
WELL, IF YOU DO...

38:53.862 --> 38:55.404
THE POLICE WILL SOON UNCOVER

38:55.404 --> 38:57.606
A STAGGERING AMOUNT
OF EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU,

38:57.606 --> 39:01.410
RIGHT DOWN
TO MY MOTHER'S TESTIMONY...

39:01.410 --> 39:04.573
ABOUT HOW YOU WERE IN LEAGUE
WITH GORDON MURPHY.

39:04.573 --> 39:06.515
I RECORDED THE WHOLE THING.

39:06.515 --> 39:09.047
MY ANSWER IS STILL NO.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.820
IF THERE'S A TRIAL,
I HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.082
AT THE VERY LEAST,
I'LL BE ABLE TO EXPOSE YOU

39:14.082 --> 39:15.924
AND YOUR TREACHERY.

39:15.924 --> 39:18.026
YOU'RE FORGETTING, MASON,

39:18.026 --> 39:20.429
THAT I'M IN POSSESSION
OF THE ONLY THING

39:20.429 --> 39:23.432
THAT COULD ONE DAY
EXONERATE YOU...

39:24.533 --> 39:26.495
A FULL CONFESSION
OF MY OWN.

39:28.697 --> 39:31.139
IF YOU COOPERATE,
I WILL SET YOU FREE

39:31.139 --> 39:32.901
WHEN I DEEM THE TIME
TO BE RIGHT.

39:32.901 --> 39:34.943
WHICH COULD BE EONS.

39:34.943 --> 39:37.946
OR JUST ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU
TO WRITE MY ENTIRE STORY,

39:37.946 --> 39:41.049
FROM THE NIGHT
MY FATHER WAS ARRESTED

39:41.049 --> 39:43.982
TO THE DAY MY VENGEANCE
IS COMPLETE.

39:43.982 --> 39:47.586
THIS IS THE BOOK...

39:47.586 --> 39:50.559
THAT WE BOTH KNOW
YOU WERE DESTINED TO WRITE.

39:50.559 --> 39:53.492
POETIC JUSTICE
OR MY TRUE LEGACY?

39:53.492 --> 39:55.794

A TOUCH OF BOTH?

39:55.794 --> 39:58.427
AND THE WORLD
WILL FINALLY MEET

39:58.427 --> 40:01.430
THE REAL LEO MASON TREADWELL.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.004
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT A DEAL,

40:06.004 --> 40:08.607
MS. CLARKE.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.609
TO PROPERLY DO PENANCE,

40:10.609 --> 40:15.444
ONE MUST EXPRESS CONTRITION
FOR ONE'S SINS...

40:15.444 --> 40:18.447
AND PERFORM ACTS
TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE

40:18.447 --> 40:21.590
CAUSED BY
THOSE TRANSGRESSIONS.

40:21.590 --> 40:24.092
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT OUR WEDDING...

40:26.154 --> 40:28.997
THE ONE YOU IMAGINED
AS A KID.

40:28.997 --> 40:32.000
SO HAVE I.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.062
I DON'T WANT
A FANCY WEDDING, JACK.

40:34.062 --> 40:35.764
(inhales deeply)

40:35.764 --> 40:37.506
ALL I NEED IS YOU...
 (coos)

40:37.506 --> 40:39.207
AND LITTLE CARL

40:39.207 --> 40:40.739
AND A FEW FRIENDS

40:40.739 --> 40:43.111
ON THE BOAT
YOU NAMED AFTER ME.

40:43.111 --> 40:45.974
(continues cooing)

40:45.974 --> 40:47.716
(knocks)

40:49.047 --> 40:52.681
SO I JUST SPOKE TO OUR
SO-CALLED SECURITY DETAIL,

40:52.681 --> 40:56.685
AND THE CAMERAS WENT BLACK
FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TODAY,

40:56.685 --> 41:01.490

KARA CLARKE MURPHY VANISHED.

41:01.490 --> 41:03.862

41:05.564 --> 41:07.566
YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD'VE
SIMPLY LET HER KILL US.

41:07.566 --> 41:10.669
I DON'T THINK THE WORD "SIMPLY"
IS EVEN IN THEIR VOCABULARY.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.801
AND AS YOU
SO ASTUTELY POINTED OUT,

41:12.801 --> 41:16.705
OUR VALUE TO THEM
IS IN OUR ABILITY TO SERVE,

41:16.705 --> 41:18.046
FOR THE MOMENT.

41:18.046 --> 41:19.748
CONRAD, THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

41:19.748 --> 41:21.049
IT'S ABOUT DANIEL--

41:21.049 --> 41:24.112
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT CAN WAIT UNTIL MORNING.
