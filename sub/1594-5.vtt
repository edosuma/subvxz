00:09.200 --> 00:11.166
Here's what you missed
on Shameless  last week:

00:11.166 --> 00:14.400
I got really drunk.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.700
I-I'm not sure
what happened after that.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.133
What the hell is he doing here?

00:20.133 --> 00:22.300
I can't afford to live somewhere
else and support you two.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.633
Hi, Frank.

00:23.633 --> 00:24.633
Shit!

00:26.467 --> 00:27.533
Who the fuck's Tony?

00:27.533 --> 00:29.133
FIONA:
Tony's sweet.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.400
STEVE: The cars I sell
are mainly not mine.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.567
I like you, Fiona.

00:31.567 --> 00:33.567
(moaning)

00:33.567 --> 00:35.500
Uh, you remember Steve?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.133
(moaning, knocking at door)

00:37.133 --> 00:39.033
Yeah. How's it going?

00:39.033 --> 00:40.633
She doesn't care if you
have a girlfriend.

00:40.633 --> 00:41.734
Neither do I.

00:41.734 --> 00:43.100
I'm getting married.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.367
You're what?
Yeah!  (laughs)

00:45.367 --> 00:48.000
Veronica Fisher, would you do me
the honor of being my wife?

00:48.000 --> 00:48.700
Yes!

00:48.700 --> 00:49.600
You don't seem very happy

00:49.600 --> 00:51.266
to be getting married.

00:51.266 --> 00:53.166
That's 'cause
I'm already married.

I wasn't even thinking
about getting married

02:12.467 --> 02:14.400
until he brought it up.
Now I'm, like, obsessed.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.467
Phillips.

02:16.467 --> 02:18.333
Wasn't he drunk
when he proposed?

02:18.333 --> 02:20.734
Oh, yeah. It was like that
David Hasselhoff video,

02:20.734 --> 02:22.633
eating a cheeseburger.

02:22.633 --> 02:24.066
I never saw that.

02:24.066 --> 02:25.633
Oh, you gotta YouTube it.

02:25.633 --> 02:28.533
It's like a car wreck--
you can't not watch.

02:28.533 --> 02:29.600
You really want a drunk proposal

02:29.600 --> 02:30.700
to be the story you tell
your grandkids?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.767
My husband proposed to me

02:32.767 --> 02:35.333
at the top
of the Sears Tower.

02:35.333 --> 02:36.400
Champagne and roses.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.333
Six months into
the marriage,

02:38.333 --> 02:40.100
I found out he was
fucking my sister.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.200
(sighs)

02:41.200 --> 02:42.567
And the moral of the story is?

02:42.567 --> 02:45.467
My sister's a bitch.

02:45.467 --> 02:47.367
Other than the presents
and the booze,

02:47.367 --> 02:49.233
give me three good reasons
why you want to get married.

02:49.233 --> 02:50.667
Lots of people who
love each other

02:50.667 --> 02:52.233
get married
every day, Fiona.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.433
I don't know, V.

02:55.433 --> 02:57.633
The way things are between
you and Kevin right now,

02:57.633 --> 02:59.500
it seems perfect.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.367
Why ruin it?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
What do you get for that?

03:16.500 --> 03:17.633
What?

03:17.633 --> 03:19.100
What are they paying

03:19.100 --> 03:21.633
for the neck thing,
disability?

03:21.633 --> 03:24.734
674 bucks a month.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.633
(laughs)

03:26.633 --> 03:30.667
That's what I get.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.400
But look,
I can do this.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.600
(chuckles)

03:46.533 --> 03:49.667
While I admire your commitment,
I gotta tell ya,

03:49.667 --> 03:52.033
it's a bit over the top.

03:52.033 --> 03:56.266
(speaking Hungarian)

03:56.266 --> 04:00.100
I told 'em I get migraines.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.767
Genius, huh?
Huh?

04:02.767 --> 04:05.567
Try proving
I don't have 'em.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.500
(chuckles)

04:07.500 --> 04:11.166
I bet it itches like
you got crabs in there.

04:15.066 --> 04:17.467
(sniffing)

04:24.367 --> 04:26.300
Kev, come out.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.333
You done?

04:30.333 --> 04:31.533
Why are we getting married?

04:31.533 --> 04:32.300
What?

04:32.300 --> 04:33.367
Other than the presents

04:33.367 --> 04:35.300
and the booze,
can you tell me

04:35.300 --> 04:37.667
three good reasons why you
want to get married?

04:37.667 --> 04:39.166
Not really.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.700
Wait a minute-- this isn't
one of those tests, is it?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.100
One of those woman things

04:43.100 --> 04:44.667
where I'm supposed
to change your mind?

04:44.667 --> 04:46.133
If it is, you just failed.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.600
You saying you don't want
to get married?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.667
No, I mean, things between
us are pretty great.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.200
I don't want to ruin it.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.567
What would we tell people?

04:53.567 --> 04:55.233
That the wedding's off.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.467
No one's damn
business why.

04:56.467 --> 04:57.633
Yeah?

04:57.633 --> 04:58.734
Yeah.

04:58.734 --> 05:02.133
Well, great then.

05:05.033 --> 05:07.066
Guess I gotta tell Mama.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.367
Oh, yeah.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.734
That's gonna suck.

05:09.734 --> 05:13.066
She's on her way over to talk
about the blessed event.

05:13.066 --> 05:17.133
I am gonna miss getting
a free KitchenAid mixer.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.333
Can we still
register for gifts,

05:18.333 --> 05:19.734
even though you're
not getting married?

05:19.734 --> 05:21.033
I got a gift for ya.

05:21.033 --> 05:22.700
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.767
(both chuckle)

05:28.166 --> 05:31.567
♪ Here comes the bride,
all dressed in white! ♪

05:31.567 --> 05:34.667
Which I think you can
still get away with, baby.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.100
(squeals, laughs)

05:36.100 --> 05:37.500
Hey, Mama.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.767
Oh, I can't believe it!
Oh, I can't believe it!

05:42.767 --> 05:44.233
I can't believe this!

05:44.233 --> 05:45.367
What happened?

05:45.367 --> 05:47.200
Nothing happened, Mama.
We just deci--

05:47.200 --> 05:48.767
How could you do this to me?
Look, Mama,

05:48.767 --> 05:51.066
nothing's gonna change.
Kev and I are still together.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.667
Yeah, Mama--
Don't call me Mama.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.433
We're just cutting out
all the paperwork, right?

05:56.433 --> 06:01.100
You know, and besides, until
gay people can get married

06:01.100 --> 06:04.467
in this state, I'm not gonna.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.767
You know this isn't what
your father wants.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.367
You know that, don't you?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.133
Daddy's dead, Mama.
He doesn't really want anything.

06:10.133 --> 06:13.734
Your daddy, rest his soul, wants
to see his little girl married.

06:13.734 --> 06:15.633
Look, Mama...

06:15.633 --> 06:18.533
That's why he set aside a little
something for you for once you

06:18.533 --> 06:20.600
finally settled down.
A little what?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.266
Your daddy left you money
for your first home

06:23.266 --> 06:25.367
once you got married.
A house?

06:25.367 --> 06:27.266
Yeah, he thought
it might keep you

06:27.266 --> 06:29.400
from being somebody's baby mama.
How much?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.633
I don't know! He wanted
the envelope opened

06:31.633 --> 06:32.533
on your wedding day.

06:32.533 --> 06:35.667
Now I guess we'll never know.

06:35.667 --> 06:39.767
I just... I never knew
how much it meant to Daddy.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.133
The world.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.333
Maybe we should
reconsider, babe.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.467
But what about the gay people?

06:46.467 --> 06:49.133
They got their parades.
They can wait.

06:49.133 --> 06:50.133
(sighs)

06:50.133 --> 06:52.767
It's hot. I'm hot.

06:52.767 --> 06:54.400
Are you guys hot?

06:56.633 --> 06:59.300
Hot!

07:00.200 --> 07:01.767
(knocking on door)

07:01.767 --> 07:03.600
Coming!

07:12.567 --> 07:14.567
(sighs)

07:15.767 --> 07:18.200
Hey.
Pee.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.734
Oh, it's fresh?

07:19.734 --> 07:21.367
Clean as a whistle.

07:21.367 --> 07:24.266
Thanks, Fiona-- you have
no idea what this means to me.

07:24.266 --> 07:25.667
Means you get
to smoke weed

07:25.667 --> 07:28.367
and keep your government
job, and I get to eat.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.767
It's lasagna,
straight from the oven.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.300
It's still warm.
So's this.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.667
Keep it that way,
if you want to pass.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.133
Lunch!

07:35.133 --> 07:36.633
Eat it or miss it, people!

07:36.633 --> 07:38.633
Thanks. Bye.

07:38.633 --> 07:40.266
What, more piss food?

07:40.266 --> 07:44.467
You know it.
All right!

07:44.467 --> 07:47.166
Cup-a-lasagna, anyone?
Right here.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.667
Who was on dishes today?

07:48.667 --> 07:51.066
IAN: Uh, I'll get
them after lunch.

07:51.066 --> 07:53.734
VERONICA: Hey, Debs, you
ready to go to Target?

07:53.734 --> 07:54.767
Yeah, sure.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.233
What's that smell?

07:56.233 --> 07:58.467
It's either vomit
or fancy cheese.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.533
It can be both if you want.

08:01.734 --> 08:03.066
FIONA:
Target?

08:03.066 --> 08:06.266
Deb's gonna go help me register
for wedding gifts.

08:06.266 --> 08:07.767
I thought
the wedding was off?

08:07.767 --> 08:09.667
VERONICA:
Back on.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.200
Kev know?
Uh-huh.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.467
Oh!

08:13.467 --> 08:14.533
Hey-hey!

08:14.533 --> 08:17.266
Mmm... damn.
You tell that girl Sonny I will

08:17.266 --> 08:18.633
crap on a paper
plate for her

08:18.633 --> 08:20.367
if it'll get me
some of this grub.

08:34.233 --> 08:35.700
WOMAN:
Francis Gallagher.
Yeah.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.433
(sighs heavily)

08:44.100 --> 08:46.233
Drop your pants.

08:46.233 --> 08:49.633
I don't see how that has
any bearings on my migraines.

08:49.633 --> 08:52.233
Me neither, but it's on
the State form.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.000
Drop 'em, sailor.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
(huffing)

08:56.000 --> 08:58.200
Yeah.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.133
Still cold. (chuckles)

09:00.133 --> 09:01.667
Cough.
(coughs)

09:01.667 --> 09:03.433
Again.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.400
(coughs)

09:04.400 --> 09:05.533
Again.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.000
(coughs)

09:07.000 --> 09:08.433
That's weird.

09:08.433 --> 09:12.467
Have you ever done
a testicular self-examination?

09:12.467 --> 09:13.700
Oh, God, no.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.333
I say leave those three
bad boys down there alone.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.567
Yeah, well,
that's the problem.

09:17.567 --> 09:21.367
Should only be two testicles
invited to this party.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.567
What's this?

09:22.567 --> 09:23.700
I need you
and your testicles

09:23.700 --> 09:25.700
back here tomorrow
for a biopsy.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.700
So, I got an extra passenger
on board.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.133
What's the big deal?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.300
Normal number's two.

09:30.300 --> 09:33.133
Not for me.
Third guy's always been there.

09:33.133 --> 09:35.567
He's my lucky charm.
Gave me six kids.

09:35.567 --> 09:38.000
Mmm. Probably benign then.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.300
You're smart not to worry
till you do a biopsy.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.500
Gives you something
to worry about.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.300
Yeah.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.166
Uh, pretty sure
you can't bring a baby
into a bar, ma'am.

09:55.166 --> 09:58.166
And I'm pretty sure you can't
get married if you already are.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.200
Yeah, I know, I know.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.400
Why the hell
doesn't she know yet?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.000
'Cause... I'm afraid
to tell her.
Kev...

10:03.000 --> 10:05.133
I don't want to
make her sad, Fi.

10:05.133 --> 10:07.033
It would break my heart
to hurt her.

10:07.033 --> 10:10.100
Just tell her
the truth, Kev.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.767
If you don't, I will.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.567
Can you hit me
with a milk refill?

10:19.233 --> 10:20.433
The devil's in
my balls, Billy,

10:20.433 --> 10:22.100
and he's comin'
for the rest of me.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.367
Let's hope he can swim.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.100
Why, Billy? Why me?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.600
Because you're
an asshole, Frank.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.667
Doc says it's probably benign.

10:30.667 --> 10:33.600
Look at Lance Armstrong.
He had that ball cancer.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.200
Yeah, he ends up fucking
a rock star. (guffaws)

10:36.200 --> 10:38.066
That's right!
That's right! See?

10:38.066 --> 10:39.033
Hey, baby!

10:39.033 --> 10:41.300
Hey-hey!

10:41.300 --> 10:43.333
How you doing?

10:43.333 --> 10:45.266
Okay, I know that
this is silly,

10:45.266 --> 10:47.033
but I'm really starting
to get excited

10:47.033 --> 10:48.066
about this whole
wedding thing.

10:48.066 --> 10:50.533
The gifts and
the wedding

10:50.533 --> 10:52.000
and being Mrs. Kevin Ball.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.333
(chuckles)

10:53.333 --> 10:55.734
You know old man
Parson's place on Fifth?

10:55.734 --> 10:57.734
I think we should buy it.

10:57.734 --> 10:59.066
What?

10:59.066 --> 11:01.000
You know, the one where
the son went crazy

11:01.000 --> 11:02.300
and hit him with an axe?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.300
It's for sale and
I think we should start,

11:04.300 --> 11:05.467
like, getting
our stuff together--

11:05.467 --> 11:08.166
all the loans and
credit scores and all that.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.500
What's the matter, babe?

11:09.500 --> 11:13.367
I'm sure they got
the blood cleaned up by now.

11:16.266 --> 11:19.633
I can't marry you, Veronica.

11:22.233 --> 11:24.133
I'm already married.

11:26.633 --> 11:28.700
She's beautiful.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.500
She's a head case.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.767
She used to throw
plates at me.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.233
She couldn't handle her booze.

11:34.233 --> 11:35.633
That's how I got the scars
on the back of my neck.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.367
Baby, you
have no idea

11:37.367 --> 11:39.767
how many times I wanted to
tell you over the years,

11:39.767 --> 11:43.266
but the more time went on,
the more unreal it all seemed.

11:45.066 --> 11:47.333
Look like a douche bag
with that mullet.

11:47.333 --> 11:51.300
(sighs)
Oh, I can't believe this.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.533
VERONICA: Guess we can forget
about buying a house.

11:53.533 --> 11:54.700
KEVIN
Yeah.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.133
FIONA:
Maybe not.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.433
What do you mean?

11:57.433 --> 11:59.300
You don't actually have
to get married, do you?

11:59.300 --> 12:01.533
I mean, your mom
wants a wedding.

12:01.533 --> 12:03.333
So, give her one.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.400
I could get
ordained online.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.333
Then we just don't file
the license with the state.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.000
A fake wedding.
(laughing)

12:10.000 --> 12:11.600
(laughs)

12:11.600 --> 12:13.233
Why not?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.400
You'd still be married.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.066
It just won't be legal.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.633
Yeah, but what's
the point then?

12:18.633 --> 12:20.266
All the free shit, baby!

12:20.266 --> 12:21.400
Oh.
Oh, damn!

12:21.400 --> 12:22.600
Oh, baby, come on.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.133
That would've sucked.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.667
Showing up at your wedding
fucking paralyzed and shit?

12:26.667 --> 12:29.066
Yeah.
Oh, shit.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.767
Looks a bit like Top Ramen
in there, doesn't it?

12:36.500 --> 12:39.367
Sweetie, would you like
me to come with you

12:39.367 --> 12:41.066
to your the biopsy?

12:41.066 --> 12:43.166
No, it's probably nothing.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.200
A benign cyst.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.400
An ingrown hair.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.734
Yes, I think
you're right.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.700
You're gonna be
just fine.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.300
(sobs)

12:54.300 --> 12:56.233
Why the hell are you crying?

12:56.233 --> 12:59.033
(crying)

13:01.700 --> 13:05.033
I knew it was
too good to be true.

13:05.033 --> 13:06.567
You're gonna die.

13:06.567 --> 13:08.333
Jesus, Sheila,
I'm not gonna die.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.333
I haven't even had
the biopsy yet.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.533
It was probably that
nut-vise sex toy

13:11.533 --> 13:13.300
of hers that gave
you the damn cancer.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.066
I'm gonna need the house
next week for Bible study.

13:16.066 --> 13:18.600
We're doing the
Passion Play again.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.667
It might get noisy.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.600
(crying)

13:22.600 --> 13:24.333
(sighs)

13:29.333 --> 13:32.400
I have two plots

13:32.400 --> 13:34.200
at Oak Woods Cemetery.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.467
One was for Eddie.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.133
Nothing would make me happier

13:38.133 --> 13:40.734
than to bury you
in one of them.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.767
(whispers):
Wait there for me.

13:44.767 --> 13:49.000
Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.600
(church bell tolling)

13:50.600 --> 13:52.600
CAROL:
He married your father and I,

13:52.600 --> 13:54.333
Aunt Rochelle, Uncle Bobby,
and cousin Jimmy with the--

13:54.333 --> 13:55.467
you know, that
first wife of his,

13:55.467 --> 13:56.767
the one
with the cleft palate.

13:56.767 --> 13:58.433
PRIEST:
A cleft palate

13:58.433 --> 14:00.700
is merely the mark
God leaves

14:00.700 --> 14:02.266
when he kisses a person

14:02.266 --> 14:03.767
before they're born.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.200
That girl's mama
just skipped the folic acid.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.700
I'm gonna need you both

14:07.700 --> 14:11.767
to come to my weekend
Engagement Encounter retreat.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.367
It covers all of the

14:13.367 --> 14:15.734
Pre-Cana material necessary

14:15.734 --> 14:18.033
for you to be married
with God's blessing.

14:18.033 --> 14:20.400
Uh, could you excuse us
for just a second, please?

14:22.633 --> 14:25.400
Might be kind of fun to do
it at a church outing, huh?

14:25.400 --> 14:27.100
Veronica, that man
in there is a priest.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.633
He's gonna
require a license.

14:28.633 --> 14:29.734
A marriage license.

14:29.734 --> 14:32.333
And I'm pretty sure
bigamy is still a felony

14:32.333 --> 14:34.133
in the state of Illinois.

14:34.133 --> 14:36.266
Why did you let your mom
drag us down here?

14:36.266 --> 14:38.000
You know that Mama
wasn't gonna take no.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.367
What about Fiona?
Wasn't she gonna marry us?

14:39.367 --> 14:41.266
Relax, baby.
I got this.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.734
You know what, Mama?

14:43.734 --> 14:46.266
We already have someone that's
gonna do the wedding for us.

14:46.266 --> 14:49.033
Is this some healing hands,
voodoo, wheat grass jackass?

14:49.033 --> 14:51.200
Because that is not a wedding
in the Lord's eyes.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.233
Go ahead,
tell them, Father.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.667
Tell them

14:53.667 --> 14:55.667
that it's not a wedding
in the Lord's eyes.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.000
Well, I know this--

14:58.000 --> 15:02.467
that just like the honeybee,
God has many eyes.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.266
Look, it has
to be a priest.

15:05.266 --> 15:07.367
That's what your father
wanted, that's what I want

15:07.367 --> 15:08.734
and that's what
the Lord wants.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.767
Wedding's not gonna work.

15:12.767 --> 15:14.000
What happened?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.500
Mama wants a real priest.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.633
Sheila said she'd make your
wedding dress, if you want.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.100
Oh, that's nice, but what
good is a dress

15:20.100 --> 15:21.567
if I don't have a priest?

15:21.567 --> 15:23.133
You could hire
an actor.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.500
Remember the guy
who played Elmo at
my birthday party?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.734
You remember that?

15:26.734 --> 15:28.033
He took his head off.

15:28.033 --> 15:29.600
It was traumatizing.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.166
You think an actor could work?

15:31.166 --> 15:32.533
You know what?
I could probably get

15:32.533 --> 15:34.400
Father Pete to do it
if Carl will help.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.700
What's it gonna cost me?

15:36.700 --> 15:38.400
Uh, Karen and I use your place
Friday night?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.533
Done.

15:39.533 --> 15:41.266
Father Pete, the groper?

15:41.266 --> 15:42.333
God willing.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.133
We got hot dogs?

15:44.133 --> 15:46.066
Mmm, no hot dogs.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.200
What?

15:59.433 --> 16:00.467
Excuse me.

16:00.467 --> 16:02.700
Better late than never.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.400
Even better on time.
What's with the costume?

16:05.400 --> 16:09.467
ROTC. I made Cadet
Lieutenant Colonel today.

16:09.467 --> 16:10.600
You did?
That's great!
Yeah.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.600
Congratulations.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.734
When I get back,

16:13.734 --> 16:15.100
I want the new stock shelved

16:15.100 --> 16:16.600
with all of the labels
facing the same direction.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.533
Where are you going?

16:17.533 --> 16:19.500
Your head is like a funnel.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.667
The Boy Scout trip
is this weekend.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.000
They have Muslim Boy Scouts?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.667
It's similar. The motto
is still "Be prepared,"

16:24.667 --> 16:26.467
but you learn how
to work with chemicals

16:26.467 --> 16:27.433
instead of tying knots.

16:27.433 --> 16:28.734
(Ian chuckles)

16:28.734 --> 16:30.600
The troop is sponsored
by the Baptist church.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.200
They give us free outfits
and overnights,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.533
and we let 'em think
we're assimilating.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.066
Everybody wins.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.200
I'll be back Sunday night.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.700
Lieutenant Colonel?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.567
I'm so proud of you.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.500
It's not that big
of a deal.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.400
Linda and the boys are
gone for two nights.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.767
We're gonna have a whole night
together to celebrate.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.667
(grunts)
Oh, God!
Good God!

17:13.667 --> 17:15.100
I'm sorry!

17:15.100 --> 17:16.233
Jesus Christ!

17:16.233 --> 17:18.000
Was that the biopsy?!

17:18.000 --> 17:19.500
(grunting)
I'm gonna
take a look.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.400
I'm just gonna take
a look.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.633
Okay, well,

17:28.633 --> 17:30.734
that is definitely better.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.400
I think you're okay.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.300
Well, now, yeah.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.133
I'm just gonna
shave you, okay?

17:41.367 --> 17:44.433
I've never been shaved down
there before.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.567
Just doing
a small section.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.567
(spray bottle hisses)

17:53.467 --> 17:55.600
Okay? Oh!

17:55.600 --> 17:58.000
I'm sorry about that.

18:00.367 --> 18:02.000
(chuckles)

18:02.000 --> 18:03.667
Maybe I could come back later

18:03.667 --> 18:05.600
and you could shave
the other two.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.667
There. All done.

18:10.667 --> 18:15.033
Ooh! It feels like Spring!

18:16.734 --> 18:20.033
Wish I could say
this wasn't gonna hurt.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.033
(Frank screaming)

18:23.033 --> 18:25.300
You don't have to go
too crazy here, Sheila,

18:25.300 --> 18:27.533
but as close to Vera Wang
as you can get.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.567
You are going to make
a beautiful bride.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.033
Aw, Sheila, you're making
me feel like Cinderella.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.100
Aw...

18:33.100 --> 18:36.300
Screw Cinderella.
Little doe-eyed bitch.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.700
Probably one of the worst role
models for little girls.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.467
I think Cinderella was
a feminist.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.767
The whole idea of marriage is
a useless vestige

18:43.767 --> 18:46.066
of an archaic
civilization.

18:46.066 --> 18:47.567
How would you know?

18:47.567 --> 18:49.333
I watched one unravel.

18:49.333 --> 18:53.133
Oh, so one example of a bad one
makes them all bad, hmm?

18:53.133 --> 18:55.166
Hmm?
In olden times, marriage was
nothing more

18:55.166 --> 18:57.633
than a legal exchange
of women for property.

18:57.633 --> 18:58.667
Maybe you're being
a little pessimistic.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.200
It's just a piece of paper!

19:01.200 --> 19:03.533
A birth certificate
is just a piece of paper.

19:03.533 --> 19:06.000
And money-- money is
just a piece of paper.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.066
But those are pretty valuable.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.333
True.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.166
Hey, Gloria Steinem,
enough of the blah-blah.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.066
Let's talk
bachelorette party.

19:14.066 --> 19:15.734
I got that covered,
don't worry.

19:15.734 --> 19:17.333
Oh, you better.
Mm-hmm.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.100
♪ 'Cause we gonna be doing it ♪

19:19.100 --> 19:20.667
♪ Uh-huh, mm-hmm! ♪
You sing it, lady!

19:20.667 --> 19:21.667
Let's go. Let's go!

19:21.667 --> 19:24.066
WOMAN:
Feeling sick,

19:24.066 --> 19:26.333
feeling tired,
seeing more of my oncologist

19:26.333 --> 19:30.367
than I see of my whole family.

19:30.367 --> 19:34.166
The hardest thing for me
to accept is the fact

19:34.166 --> 19:35.633
that I can't fix this.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.700
I'm so used to being the mom,
you know?

19:37.700 --> 19:43.433
The one who takes care
of everyone and everything.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.767
The fixer.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.734
And this is
breast cancer.

19:46.734 --> 19:52.667
(voice breaking):
I can't fix this.

19:52.667 --> 19:56.300
Just knowing your tits are
trying to kill you...

19:56.300 --> 19:58.033
that's gotta suck.

19:58.033 --> 20:00.433
I mean, mine's in my balls.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.233
At least they've got a reason
to be pissed.

20:03.233 --> 20:07.166
Tucked between two legs,
wedged right near your asshole.

20:07.166 --> 20:11.400
There's no good way to sit,
no underwear that's been devised

20:11.400 --> 20:15.000
to hold 'em
effectively in place.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
They're a bizarre appendage.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.433
An afterthought.

20:18.433 --> 20:21.700
Which is why I don't believe in
intelligent design.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.767
There is no God.

20:23.767 --> 20:26.667
We're all gonna die.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.066
Why do I have to do it?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.533
LIP:
'Cause you're the only one

20:34.533 --> 20:36.200
who's young enough
to be an altar boy.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.266
We'll stop him before
anything goes down.

20:38.266 --> 20:39.300
Or anyone.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.200
(both laugh)

20:42.400 --> 20:44.633
(knocks)

20:44.633 --> 20:47.066
The Gallagher boys.

20:47.066 --> 20:49.166
If you're here to steal
the noon offering basket,

20:49.166 --> 20:50.233
you're out of luck.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.266
Already off to the bank.
No, no.

20:52.266 --> 20:55.300
Carl here is interested
in being an altar boy.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.700
That's a big responsibility.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.200
Yeah, we know.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.033
We tried talking him out of it,
but he cried and cried,

21:00.033 --> 21:01.166
so we thought we'd bring him in,

21:01.166 --> 21:02.633
see if you thought
he had what it takes.

21:02.633 --> 21:05.600
Hello there, Carl.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
Be back for ya
in a bit, bud.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.767
Want to watch Scarface
again tonight?

21:16.767 --> 21:18.333
Can't. Got a date.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.734
Ooh, a Mandy date or Kash date?

21:20.734 --> 21:22.567
Kash date.

21:22.567 --> 21:25.033
You're a slut, man.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.133
(thud, man groans)

21:27.133 --> 21:28.667
Shit!

21:28.667 --> 21:30.200
(priest groaning)

21:31.433 --> 21:34.433
Looks like we have a priest
for V's wedding.

21:34.433 --> 21:35.467
(priest groans)

21:35.467 --> 21:38.000
A fake priest?

21:38.000 --> 21:39.200
No, no, priest is real.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.066
We're just not gonna file
the license.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.066
A little immoral,
don't you think?

21:42.066 --> 21:43.233
Like lying to God's face?

21:43.233 --> 21:44.233
Really, Mr. Morality?

21:44.233 --> 21:46.367
Whose car is this that we're in?

21:46.367 --> 21:47.767
It's not like I have
a priest in the back.

21:47.767 --> 21:50.066
Are you still picking up
the cake?

21:50.066 --> 21:51.433
Angelica's Bakery.

21:51.433 --> 21:54.333
Hey, can Kev and V use
this car for their big exit

21:54.333 --> 21:55.333
after the reception?

21:55.333 --> 21:56.567
Uh, yeah, I think
that could work.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.066
I just, I need it back
right after.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.567
Okay.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.066
You can't do anything
bad to it.

22:01.066 --> 22:02.600
And no sex in it.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.066
No sex in it?

22:06.633 --> 22:09.266
I just need this thing
in perfect condition.

22:09.266 --> 22:10.266
All right, Fiona,

22:10.266 --> 22:12.000
I just... Whoa, whoa!
(tires squeal)

22:12.000 --> 22:13.567
(siren wails)
Aw, damn it! Damn it!

22:13.567 --> 22:15.367
Jesus!

22:15.367 --> 22:16.367
Relax, relax.

22:16.367 --> 22:17.533
It happens, okay?

22:17.533 --> 22:19.767
Yeah? What happens,
prison time?

22:29.600 --> 22:31.066
Hey, Fiona.

22:31.066 --> 22:32.700
I thought that was you.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.100
Your uniform looks
different.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.767
Yeah, they issued new coats.

22:37.767 --> 22:40.066
See you at Kev and Veronica's
wedding tomorrow?

22:40.066 --> 22:43.166
Yeah.
I'm gonna need to
see your license and
registration, sir.

22:43.166 --> 22:46.200
What? Why, Officer, sir?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.066
Well, you were
doing 35 in a 25.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.300
And there was some
swerving.

22:49.300 --> 22:50.667
That was kind
of weird.

22:50.667 --> 22:53.033
Here's my license,
but I actually don't have

22:53.033 --> 22:54.533
the registration.
It's actually my friend's car.

22:54.533 --> 22:57.300
You really are supposed
to have that on you
at all times.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.000
Let me see
what I can do.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.133
I'll be right back.

23:00.133 --> 23:01.200
Okay.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.133
Why did you give him
your license?!

23:03.133 --> 23:04.133
That's not my real license.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.467
Yeah, so now what?
We run?

23:05.467 --> 23:07.133
(phone beeps on)
No, that never works.

23:08.066 --> 23:09.700
Jesus, you got me?

23:09.700 --> 23:11.166
Yeah, thanks, buddy.
(phone beeps off)

23:11.166 --> 23:12.734
Well, who's Jesus?

23:12.734 --> 23:15.567
Follow car.
Always use a follow car.

23:15.567 --> 23:18.133
(four gunshots)

23:19.533 --> 23:22.500
(siren wails)

23:22.500 --> 23:24.300
(horn honking)

23:28.000 --> 23:30.400
Watch your speed, sir.
See you at the wedding, Fi.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.667
Okay!

23:31.667 --> 23:33.000
Out.
What?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Get out!
Oh!

23:40.166 --> 23:41.367
What about the car?

23:41.367 --> 23:43.166
Taken care of.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.400
My heart's in my
throat right now.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.633
It's adrenaline.
It's kinda cool, isn't it?

24:05.033 --> 24:06.033
(horn honking urgently)

24:06.033 --> 24:07.333
I'll see you
at the wedding

24:07.333 --> 24:08.567
What?

24:08.567 --> 24:11.500
Angelica's Bakery, right?
Yeah, right.

24:14.166 --> 24:17.433
FRANK:
I've decided to start wearing
a tie every day.

24:17.433 --> 24:21.266
I could die at any moment.

24:21.266 --> 24:25.066
I thought it'd be nice
to look my best

24:25.066 --> 24:27.533
for the Grim Reaper.
Son of a bitch.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.600
You know what?

24:31.600 --> 24:32.667
Fuck him.

24:34.066 --> 24:35.200
Fuck him!

24:35.200 --> 24:37.066
Why give him the satisfaction?

24:37.066 --> 24:38.300
I'll do it myself.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.734
Take my own goddamn life.

24:42.133 --> 24:44.467
You know...

24:44.467 --> 24:46.300
you know what
the real shame

24:46.300 --> 24:47.734
of it is, Kev?

24:47.734 --> 24:54.000
The real shame is there are so
many things I still want to do.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.467
Oh, yeah? Like what?

24:57.734 --> 24:59.133
(splutter, sighs)

24:59.133 --> 25:01.667
Jesus Christ! I don't know.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.100
I don't know!

25:03.100 --> 25:05.166
How sad is that?

25:05.166 --> 25:08.233
A man who doesn't even know
what he wants to do.

25:08.233 --> 25:09.500
MAN:
Whoo-hoo!

25:09.500 --> 25:11.200
Hey, what's going on?
Yeah, buddy!

25:11.200 --> 25:12.467
What's this?

25:12.467 --> 25:14.200
You gotta wear it tonight
for the bachelor party.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.700
Everyone's gonna be
wearing one.

25:16.700 --> 25:19.100
Andy, get the fuck out of here.
I'm not gonna...

25:19.100 --> 25:20.767
Don't be a dick, dude!
Fuckin' wear it!

25:20.767 --> 25:22.233
FRANK:
Bachelor party?

25:24.033 --> 25:26.033
Yeah, if you wanna go,
you can come.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.600
What's the plan?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.467
Me and my friends
are gonna get

25:29.467 --> 25:31.000
wasted and do some stupid shit.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.533
But we gotta get you one
of these.

25:36.233 --> 25:39.100
Awesome. (laughs)

25:39.100 --> 25:41.200
IAN: Is the blindfold
for the element of surprise

25:41.200 --> 25:42.767
or so I don't know
where you live?

25:42.767 --> 25:43.633
A little of both.

25:43.633 --> 25:47.100
Ooh!

25:47.100 --> 25:49.567
♪ Ta-da! ♪

25:50.700 --> 25:53.734
Oh...

25:53.734 --> 25:54.767
Oh.

25:54.767 --> 25:57.767
Wow, yeah.

25:57.767 --> 25:59.266
This is your house.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.367
Where you live with Linda...

26:01.367 --> 26:02.367
and the kids.

26:02.367 --> 26:04.400
And now it's our house.

26:06.033 --> 26:07.133
(sighs)

26:10.033 --> 26:11.467
(sighs)

26:27.166 --> 26:29.100
What's wrong?

26:29.100 --> 26:30.734
Sorry.
It's just, it's too weird.

26:30.734 --> 26:32.066
What is?

26:32.066 --> 26:33.333
All of your shit.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.200
It's, it's freaking me out!

26:35.200 --> 26:37.000
It smells like goats
in here, man.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.567
Ian, wait!

26:40.567 --> 26:42.700
(rock music blaring)

26:57.533 --> 26:59.333
VERONICA:
But why would she do it

26:59.333 --> 27:01.300
in the first place, Fi?

27:01.300 --> 27:02.700
Because she could!

27:02.700 --> 27:05.400
She was like one of those
weird Chinese acrobats.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.166
Oh! No, those
girls are all tiny

27:07.166 --> 27:08.400
and cute
when they do it!

27:08.400 --> 27:11.333
She was like Pippi Longstocking
kissing her own ass!

27:11.333 --> 27:12.400
(both laughing)

27:12.400 --> 27:13.767
Jesus!

27:13.767 --> 27:16.667
Dad, what the hell
happened to you?

27:16.667 --> 27:18.233
Cord was too long.

27:18.233 --> 27:20.667
I got three nuts.
Gonna die.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.600
(women laughing)

27:24.600 --> 27:27.266
VERONICA: What's that
nasty-ass hair about?

27:35.467 --> 27:37.333

Marty?!

28:26.333 --> 28:28.333
Surprise! (giggles)

28:28.333 --> 28:29.767
I'm the maid of honor at your
fake wedding

28:29.767 --> 28:31.533
and I didn't even know
you had a brother.

28:31.533 --> 28:33.400
KEVIN: There's a
reason for that.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.266
He busted out
of prison?
Last night.

28:35.266 --> 28:36.300
What was he in for?

28:36.300 --> 28:38.533
Aggravated assault,
larceny and arson.

28:38.533 --> 28:40.200
Arson? Who we talkin' about?

28:40.200 --> 28:42.400
V's brother.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.266
Oh, is that like
a sibling-brother,

28:44.266 --> 28:45.400
or just a black guy brother?

28:45.400 --> 28:47.533
You remember the fire at
the Curves in the mini mall?

28:47.533 --> 28:49.000
That was him.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.066
He loves setting
fire to things and
he hates women.

28:51.066 --> 28:53.000
It was the perfect storm.
He's nuts.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.200
No, I'm serious. He's nuts.
He came at me.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.467
I had to fight my ass off.
Then, one time,

28:57.467 --> 28:59.533
I'm having a brew,
he came up to me,

28:59.533 --> 29:01.133
he's all,
"Ass cunt fuck!" on me.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.400
Is he retarded?
VERONICA: I wish.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.400
Tourette's coupled
with bipolar disorder
and a drinking problem.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.233
He's a shrink's
wet dream.

29:08.233 --> 29:10.300
What are we gonna do?

29:10.300 --> 29:11.667
Kick his ass back to prison

29:11.667 --> 29:14.300
'cause if there's one person
you can always count on

29:14.300 --> 29:16.100
to really fuck things up,
it's Marty.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.300
Bungee jumping, eh?

29:17.300 --> 29:19.500
From the El tracks.

29:19.500 --> 29:22.600
Good news/bad: your biopsy
results came back negative.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.000
Tumor was benign,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.433
so you're not gonna die
of testicular cancer.

29:26.433 --> 29:29.700
Oh! Oh, thank God! Oh!

29:29.700 --> 29:31.433
Oh! So, I can keep it?

29:31.433 --> 29:35.300
Yeah. The swelling on the brain
you've probably got going

29:35.300 --> 29:37.166
on in there
might end up doin' you in.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.100
What?!

29:38.100 --> 29:39.033
I'm fuckin' with you.

29:39.033 --> 29:42.000
The bump looks
pretty superficial,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.233
but if you vomit more than
twice, have any seizures

29:45.233 --> 29:47.500
or experience memory loss,
call 911.

29:47.500 --> 29:51.300
Well, what if I vomit
while I'm having a seizure

29:51.300 --> 29:53.300
and have no memory of it?

29:53.300 --> 29:54.633
Tree in the forest, my friend.

29:54.633 --> 29:55.633
(chuckles)

29:55.633 --> 29:56.767
What?

30:00.600 --> 30:02.467
You know you can't stay, Marty.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.333
You gotta go back to prison.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.367
Look, Ron,
it's bullshit security.

30:06.367 --> 30:08.200
They practically give you
your own key.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.567
Aren't you risking
your parole?

30:09.567 --> 30:11.734
How long did you have left?

30:11.734 --> 30:13.066
18-- cocksucker!-- months!

30:13.066 --> 30:14.734
Jesus, Marty,
that's no time at all.

30:14.734 --> 30:16.100
It's your wedding day, Ron.

30:16.100 --> 30:18.000
Why don't you go back
and turn yourself in?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.767
Tell 'em it was a mistake.
Blame it on the Tourette's.

30:19.767 --> 30:22.100
Tell them that it
won't happen again.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.734
You know it's for the best.
Faggot!

30:24.734 --> 30:27.700
I'm gonna go get cleaned up,
and we'll have you back

30:27.700 --> 30:29.100
before they even know you left.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.467
Look, I'm not going
back, Ron!

30:30.467 --> 30:33.066
It's your wedding day
and I'm not gonna miss your--

30:33.066 --> 30:34.767
shit-pisser-- wedding day!

30:42.367 --> 30:47.734
This is the dress that
I will wear this afternoon.

30:47.734 --> 30:54.233
And it will protect me
like this house protects me.

30:54.233 --> 30:57.433
This is the dress.

30:57.433 --> 31:00.367
And today is the day.

31:00.367 --> 31:02.767
And the day is good.

31:02.767 --> 31:04.567
You look nice.

31:04.567 --> 31:06.100
Where are you pretending to go?

31:06.100 --> 31:09.266
I'm going to a wedding today.

31:09.266 --> 31:12.166
I am really gonna do it
this time.

31:12.166 --> 31:15.633
And it's supposed to be
a beautiful day today.

31:15.633 --> 31:21.000
Beautiful and safe
and sunny.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.100
The sun's just
a burning ball of fire

31:23.100 --> 31:26.000
that could plunge
from the sky at any time.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.767
I think we should just
let him come to the wedding.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.033
No way. I'm not having that
nutcase at my wedding.

31:35.033 --> 31:38.000
Can you imagine the service?
"Do you Veronica--

31:38.000 --> 31:40.266
"Fucking bitch!-- Fisher

31:40.266 --> 31:42.200
"take this man--

31:42.200 --> 31:44.266
"Fuck stick!--
Kevin Ball...?"

31:44.266 --> 31:47.233
Uh-uh, no, I'm taking
him back to prison

31:47.233 --> 31:50.133
where he belongs if I gotta drag
his ass back there myself.

31:50.133 --> 31:52.400
KEVIN: Always happens
when he's off his meds.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.166
Right. Give me your dress
so I can steam it.

31:55.166 --> 31:56.734
Behind the door.

31:56.734 --> 31:59.333
(Kevin and Fiona laugh)

32:01.000 --> 32:02.400
No.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.000
Bathroom door.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.433
MARTY:
It's a real pretty dress, Roni.

32:06.433 --> 32:10.600
It'll burn nicely
with all this taffeta.

32:12.433 --> 32:13.767
Oh, Jesus.

32:13.767 --> 32:16.600
You send me back to jail,
this dress goes up!

32:16.600 --> 32:18.700
This house goes up!
We all go up!

32:18.700 --> 32:24.066
Marty? Marty,
open the door.

32:24.066 --> 32:26.000
Open the goddamn door!

32:26.000 --> 32:29.233
You're not getting married
without me.

32:29.233 --> 32:31.300
Cock fuck!

32:33.500 --> 32:35.000
He's not doing anything.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.066
He's sitting in there
lighting a lighter.

32:37.066 --> 32:39.133
Oh, my God, he's gonna
burn the house down.

32:39.133 --> 32:41.133
This is what he did
at Granddaddy's funeral.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.133
Gutted out half
the hospice.
Maybe we should
call the cops.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.266
Kev's right.
The house goes up

32:44.266 --> 32:46.533
we're not gonna be able
to get him out of there.

32:46.533 --> 32:48.667
You want me to call
cops on my own brother?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.033
It's always been
like this.

32:50.033 --> 32:52.033
Nobody else could ever
be the center of attention.

32:52.033 --> 32:53.700
It's always got
to be about him.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.000
You should be in
a nuthouse!

32:55.000 --> 32:56.166
LIP:
What's going on?

32:56.166 --> 32:57.600
Veronica's brother locked
himself in the bathroom.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.000
He's threatening to burn
the place down.
Cool!

33:00.000 --> 33:03.266
He saying that he's gonna
light both the dress and

33:03.266 --> 33:04.567
the shit-sack house
on fire.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.600
What's a shit-sack?

33:06.600 --> 33:09.367
All I wanted was
to own my own home

33:09.367 --> 33:11.367
and maybe some small
kitchen appliances

33:11.367 --> 33:14.000
for your, for me,
for our home...

33:14.000 --> 33:15.467
Maybe some kids someday.

33:15.467 --> 33:17.433
I thought you didn't want
to have any kids.

33:17.433 --> 33:18.667
Based on what?

33:18.667 --> 33:20.200
You saying
how much you hate 'em.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.500
Yeah, other people's.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.533
But I might not mind having
a baby Kev runnin' round.

33:24.533 --> 33:27.233
A little "tomorrow person"?

33:27.233 --> 33:28.333
What?

33:28.333 --> 33:30.300
That's what I call
little mixed-race babies:

33:30.300 --> 33:31.633
Tomorrow people.

33:31.633 --> 33:34.333
Little people of tomorrow.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.767
What are we gonna do?

33:36.767 --> 33:39.200
Maybe we should
just call it off.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.433
No, not a chance.

33:40.433 --> 33:42.000
Baby, listen,
this our time.

33:42.000 --> 33:46.133
We're gonna get fake married,
and nothing's gonna stop us.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.500
Tomorrow people?

33:52.500 --> 33:54.300
Tomorrow people.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.500
IAN: Hey, can you sign in
for me at detention today?

34:00.500 --> 34:04.467
Mrs. Pinder won't notice.
She's almost blind.

34:04.467 --> 34:05.767
You ditchin'?

34:05.767 --> 34:07.100
Kash has something
planned.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.533
I thought that was
last night.

34:09.533 --> 34:11.200
Was supposed to be,

34:11.200 --> 34:13.467
but he took me
to his place,

34:13.467 --> 34:15.066
and it sort of
freaked me out.

34:15.066 --> 34:17.333
I mean, I always knew
he had a wife

34:17.333 --> 34:20.300
and a life and everything,
but seeing it and...

34:20.300 --> 34:21.467
and smelling it...

34:21.467 --> 34:23.567
I mean, his life
actually has an odor.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.200
What was that for?

34:30.200 --> 34:34.200
I just felt like kissing
my boyfriend.

34:34.200 --> 34:36.166
Have fun fucking Kash.

34:50.066 --> 34:52.266
(flames whooshing)
Remember when we were little,

34:52.266 --> 34:54.433
and you'd always tag along
with me, wherever I went?

34:56.400 --> 34:59.567
I always looked after you,
didn't I, Marty?

34:59.567 --> 35:01.767
And do you know why?

35:01.767 --> 35:04.266
Because I'm your
big little sister

35:04.266 --> 35:08.567
and I didn't want you
to get in trouble,
because I love you.

35:08.567 --> 35:11.200
And that's why I want you
to go back to prison.

35:14.567 --> 35:16.367
But you know what?

35:16.367 --> 35:19.700
I've been thinking about my
wedding, and you know something?

35:19.700 --> 35:22.066
You were right...

35:22.066 --> 35:26.066
'cause my wedding day
wouldn't be my wedding day

35:26.066 --> 35:28.200
without my little
big brother there.

35:31.433 --> 35:36.400
In fact, I'd like you to be
the one to give me away.

35:38.567 --> 35:40.266
Marty?

35:46.767 --> 35:48.533
You mean it?

35:48.533 --> 35:50.467
Cross my heart.

35:50.467 --> 35:51.500
Come here,
you little nut.

35:52.467 --> 35:54.333
(grunts)

35:55.000 --> 35:57.533
Ah! Ah!

35:57.533 --> 36:01.266

Um... I don't think it can get

36:56.633 --> 36:57.700
any bigger, Dad.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.667

loss and vomit.

37:06.533 --> 37:07.767
Mm-hmm.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.400
I'm not gonna surround myself
with negative energy.

37:10.400 --> 37:14.000
How about you just show up
at this wedding,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.233
do what you do best: drink
free booze and look happy?

37:17.233 --> 37:18.200
Yes?

37:18.200 --> 37:20.133
(chuckles)

37:20.133 --> 37:23.467
All right, Frank,
I am ready.

37:23.467 --> 37:24.567
You're coming, Mom?

37:24.567 --> 37:26.133
Yes, I'm coming.

37:26.133 --> 37:27.500
(mouthing):
She's not going anywhere.

37:27.500 --> 37:31.667
I've got my purse
and my gift and my gloves

37:31.667 --> 37:35.433
and my selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor

37:35.433 --> 37:39.200
and my monoamine
oxidase inhibitor.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.600
I have my anti-anxiety
disco biscuits.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.700
And I am ready to go.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.100
I am really ready.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.700
I'll just get you
a piece of cake, Mom.

38:16.767 --> 38:18.367
That would just be...

38:20.166 --> 38:21.467
...wonderful, sweetheart.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.633
There's just so much
I've gotta get done here.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.333
Ah, that bitch.

38:41.333 --> 38:44.633

38:56.633 --> 39:00.266
May daily problems never cause
you undue anxiety,

39:00.266 --> 39:04.500
nor the desire for earthly
possessions dominate your lives,

39:04.500 --> 39:07.667
but may your hearts' first
desire be always the good things

40:26.567 --> 40:29.767
When it comes to good things,
most of 'em come

40:29.767 --> 40:32.567
in pairs
like your favorite jeans,

40:32.567 --> 40:36.033
new socks and Kevin
and Veronica.

40:36.033 --> 40:39.700
And as it turns out,
most people's testicles.

40:39.700 --> 40:47.500
So here's to the happy couple,
Kevin, Veronica, may you always

40:47.500 --> 40:50.333

Thank you.

41:12.367 --> 41:14.133
Are you fucking
kidding me?

41:17.266 --> 41:19.600
We're gettin'
a Barbie house, baby!

41:19.600 --> 41:21.333

41:21.333 --> 41:24.667
Maybe you're making
yourself too available?

41:24.667 --> 41:26.133
You think?

41:26.133 --> 41:29.400
Hey, lady friend,
where the hell is my cake?

41:29.400 --> 41:32.734
Steve is supposed to be here
with the damn thing.

41:32.734 --> 41:35.233
That's the trouble
with the exciting ones.

41:35.233 --> 41:38.233
The unpredictability is what
makes them so exciting,

41:38.233 --> 41:42.033
but it's also what makes them
so damned unpredictable.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.033
He may not be Steve,

41:44.033 --> 41:45.767
but he's here.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.700
Hi.

41:51.700 --> 41:53.500
Hi.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.066
Do you wanna dance?

41:55.066 --> 41:56.233
The Bible is
the Word of God,

41:56.233 --> 41:59.033
How can it be
the Word of God
passed down

41:59.033 --> 42:03.667
if it was rewritten
by King James?
from generation
to generation.

42:03.667 --> 42:07.100
FRANK:
It doesn't make any sense.

42:07.100 --> 42:10.400
This was really a perfect day.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.400
I only wish little Marty
could have been here.

42:21.767 --> 42:25.000

42:45.133 --> 42:46.467

43:03.400 --> 43:05.166
Okay, Gallaghers,

43:05.166 --> 43:06.433
you're the only family
I got,

43:06.433 --> 43:08.166
so let's put this
on film, huh?

43:08.166 --> 43:10.000
(camera timer beeping)

43:10.000 --> 43:11.133
Ah.

43:11.133 --> 43:12.200
Wait...
Is it on?

43:12.200 --> 43:14.633
It's on.
It's on, it's on.

43:14.633 --> 43:15.667
Did it go?
It's not on.

43:15.667 --> 43:18.033
Go get...
ALL:
Aah!

43:18.033 --> 43:18.734
(indistinct chatter)

43:18.734 --> 43:20.133
Set it up again,
here we go.

43:20.133 --> 43:21.266
Ready?

43:21.266 --> 43:22.133
Okay.
Here we go.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.734
Hey, sexy.

43:25.600 --> 43:26.633

43:26.633 --> 43:28.300

Yeah...

43:30.233 --> 43:31.166

43:31.166 --> 43:33.166
