WEBVTT

00:21.855 --> 00:25.066
[Lady Whistledown] If the Ancient Greeks
were members of the ton,

00:25.150 --> 00:27.902
they might have added
to their Olympic pentathlon

00:27.986 --> 00:30.905
one additional event.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.867
The hosting of a country visit.

00:34.617 --> 00:37.328
This, of course,
is the week of Lady Bridgerton's

00:37.412 --> 00:40.498
annual Hearts and Flowers Ball,

00:40.582 --> 00:44.294
the year's most coveted invitation
in the country,

00:44.377 --> 00:46.546
and no event better designed

00:46.629 --> 00:50.175
to show the might and mettle of its host.

00:50.258 --> 00:53.762
Miss Patridge requires large amounts
of sugar for her morning tea,

00:53.845 --> 00:56.514
and Lord Abernathy, he will refuse to eat

00:56.598 --> 00:58.308
any meat that is not well-cooked,

00:58.391 --> 01:02.520
while Lady Abernathy will only consume
her meat bloody, I am told. [chuckles]

01:02.604 --> 01:06.274
And make sure you put
an extra blanket on Lord Weston's bed.

01:06.357 --> 01:08.401
I hear he feels the cold.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.737
The roses and carnations
have arrived, ma'am.

01:10.820 --> 01:15.158
You may wish to add in lilac, Mama.
Symbolic of first love.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
And perhaps make the bouquets even bigger.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.498
I have taught you well.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.666
If there is truly to be a proposal

01:23.750 --> 01:26.711
before the week is out,
Anthony will need all the help he can get.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.629
Hmm.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.465
[chuckles] Right.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.134
[crunches]

01:33.218 --> 01:35.678
I was painting that.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.932
Do you think all of this was a mistake?

01:39.015 --> 01:41.142
This business of inviting
the Sharmas out early?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.270
It has made the whole affair
so fraught with difficulty.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.857
The whole marriage-mart business
seems entirely too difficult to me.

01:47.941 --> 01:53.071
But if one must participate in it,
why not do it…

01:56.741 --> 01:58.201
in the fresh air?

01:58.284 --> 01:59.494
[birds chirping]

02:01.746 --> 02:02.997
[sighs deeply]

02:09.921 --> 02:11.047
Didi?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.298
Is it the sting?

02:12.382 --> 02:14.717
What? Whatever do you mean?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.678
Is it still bothering you?

02:17.554 --> 02:20.014
It seems ever since
the awful creature pricked you,

02:20.098 --> 02:21.724
you've been keeping to yourself.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.642
No. [chuckles]

02:22.725 --> 02:24.185
No, not at all, Bon.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.687
And, uh, how are you?

02:25.770 --> 02:29.607
Are you… Are you still feeling upset
by the viscount's lack of action?

02:29.691 --> 02:31.693
[sighs] His mind seems elsewhere lately.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.864
I thought I'd be announcing an engagement
at tomorrow night's ball.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.740
We return to Mayfair in a few days,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.160
where there will be many other suitors,

02:40.243 --> 02:41.161
as I told you.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.830
Suitors who will only suspect
that there is something lacking in me

02:43.913 --> 02:46.040
when they discover
the viscount is no longer interested.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.041
Bon… [scoffs]

02:47.125 --> 02:49.961
He is the one I want, Kate.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.421
The viscount.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.632
His family, this home,
the life he offers me.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.140
I've been thinking, and…

03:03.725 --> 03:07.228
I am now quite certain I know
why he has not yet made his declaration.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.480
It is because of you.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.817
You hate one another.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.654
[sighs]

03:17.864 --> 03:19.699
Uh, hate is probably too strong a word.

03:19.782 --> 03:23.369
It is clear from your exchanges with
the viscount that he shares your feelings.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.955
All this time, I thought I needed

03:26.039 --> 03:28.416
your help getting him
to fall in love with me.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.377
But I have realized

03:32.212 --> 03:36.090
what I need is your help
getting him to fall in love with you.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.469
Edwina, I certainly can't--

03:39.552 --> 03:42.597
Can you really not see
anything engaging about him?

03:42.680 --> 03:45.433
Yes. I suppose I can see
how he might engage

03:46.559 --> 03:48.645
a person. Yes.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.522
Then you'll still help me
encourage him to propose?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.108
Because I have not given up.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.152
I will not give up.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.262
[uptempo classical music plays]

04:33.356 --> 04:34.649
[shopkeeper bell chimes]

04:55.420 --> 04:58.756
[sighs] It is hotter than a pepper patch
out here in the country.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.677
I do not believe it is any hotter here
than it is in London. We are simply stuck.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.763
-What is the delay?
-I'm sure someone lost an axle.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.517
Oh, there's the Cowper carriage
just ahead of us.

05:17.692 --> 05:18.943
[driver] Walk on.

05:19.027 --> 05:19.902
Finally.

05:21.070 --> 05:24.490
[pleasant classical tune playing]

05:24.574 --> 05:25.950
[indistinct chatter]

05:30.663 --> 05:32.457
[Violet] Welcome. Lovely to see you again.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.374
Thank you.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.967
I fear I still hardly know
the lady my brother is planning to marry.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.261
[Violet] I fear
he hardly knows her either.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.973
Though something tells me that is
how your brother would like it to remain.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.685
Mm. Well, perhaps
I should get to know her for him.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.771
[Eloise speaking indistinctly]

05:55.897 --> 05:57.982
Oh, Pen! Oh, you are finally here.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.069
With only my own family to speak to,
I've begun talking to the trees.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.904
-Is she calling me wooden?
-I don't think so.

06:02.987 --> 06:03.905
I could call him worse.

06:03.988 --> 06:07.075
Is there not another pamphlet
on women's rights to read somewhere?

06:07.158 --> 06:10.078
-[Penelope] El is quite done with that.
-She has brought one with her here.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.080
Prepare yourself
for many a quotation, Pen.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.540
The printer's pamphlet?
I thought you'd realized

06:14.624 --> 06:16.250
he was not connected to Lady Whistledown.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.544
Those letter K's have not
been smudged for some time now.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.422
I am just as much interested
in their new letters now.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.550
It is a rather radical publication,
which is why I seem to like it so much.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.637
-The apprentice there, Mr. Theo Sharpe--
-You know his name?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.639
Don't think you're getting
into dangerous waters?

06:29.722 --> 06:31.933
-That side of town?
-I've tried to dissuade her from it.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.103
Perhaps you can convince her
while I am gone today.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.438
-Where are you going?
-Are you joining the men on the hunt?

06:37.522 --> 06:38.731
I am not.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.526
I have decided
to pay your cousin a visit, in fact.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.236
-Marina?
-[Eloise] Miss Thompson?

06:44.278 --> 06:46.823
I rather think I am not the only one
getting into dangerous waters.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.533
[Violet] Eloise, Penelope.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.954
I think you will find we have
much to offer the young ladies today.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.997
Yes, well, Pen is a young lady,

06:55.081 --> 06:56.749
and we do have
so much to catch up on, so--

06:56.833 --> 07:00.420
Eloise… I hope you will behave yourself
this week. We…

07:00.503 --> 07:01.796
We are hosts.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.425
Perhaps you and Penelope
might like to spend some time

07:05.508 --> 07:07.718
with the other young ladies
in attendance. Hmm?

07:08.344 --> 07:11.347
Or, at the very least,
there will be some good gossip to absorb.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.183
We'd not dream of doing
anything different, Lady Bridgerton.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.186
[Eloise chuckles awkwardly]

07:21.023 --> 07:22.233
Kate!

07:25.528 --> 07:26.863
Come sit with us.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.873
Miss Sharma.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.082
Lord Bridgerton.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.840
[Anthony clears throat]

07:48.718 --> 07:50.553
Did you tell the viscount
about your beesting?

07:50.636 --> 07:51.679
[chuckles softly]

07:53.222 --> 07:54.474
I got stung.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.600
Ah.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.727
I am well.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.312
Ah.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.403
Kate was telling me
how she is eager to see more

08:07.487 --> 08:09.322
of the grounds of this magnificent estate.

08:10.031 --> 08:10.865
I was?

08:10.948 --> 08:13.826
After having spent
the last few days on her own.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.830
Might you give her a tour today
while I spend time with the other ladies?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.458
I am certain Lord Bridgerton
is occupied with other guests.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.585
Shooting, in fact,
with the other gentlemen.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.754
The party is to leave
quite soon, I'm afraid.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.006
Did you know Kate is an excellent shot?

08:27.089 --> 08:28.174
Of course she is.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.342
[Anthony chuckles]

08:29.842 --> 08:32.094
-Are we all set for the hunt, Brother?
-Indeed we are.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.096
Kate, tell him how
you used to shoot all the time.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.182
-Miss Edwina-- [chuckles]
-Kate is being modest.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.101
Do you not think it true?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.730
Perhaps your sister
aims straight on the field,

08:42.813 --> 08:45.066
but surely she would have
some trouble managing--

08:45.149 --> 08:47.777
Why would you assume I had
any trouble managing at all, my lord?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.654
-I only mean to say--
-Because I am a woman?

08:49.737 --> 08:50.988
No-- No.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.073
I did not say that.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.241
But you thought it.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.662
[chuckles]

08:58.663 --> 08:59.789
Ladies do not hunt.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.582
Do not, or are not allowed to?

09:01.666 --> 09:06.546
I am certain Lady Danbury
can spare a maid to act as chaperone.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.924
Oh, what fun you will all have.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.843
Getting to know each other all the better.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.012
[Benedict] What an excellent idea,
Miss Edwina.

09:15.096 --> 09:15.930
[Edwina] Hmm.

09:16.013 --> 09:19.058
Surely we can make an exception,
just this one time.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.019
We are on our private lands,
after all. And who knows?

09:22.103 --> 09:24.605
Perhaps Miss Sharma
can teach you a thing or two.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.773
[Edwina chuckles]

09:27.608 --> 09:28.609
[Benedict] Hmm?

09:43.791 --> 09:44.917
[driver] Whoa, there!

10:01.684 --> 10:02.727
[exhales]

10:04.687 --> 10:06.105
[door opens]

10:08.316 --> 10:09.817
-Colin.
-[Colin] Marina.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.152
Uh, Miss Thompson.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.070
Lady Crane.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.323
I'm so pleased to see you.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.242
[baby coos]

10:18.743 --> 10:21.662
Oh, this is Oliver. Amanda is sleeping.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.414
There are two of them?

10:23.497 --> 10:24.957
-Twins.
-[Colin] Twins.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.917
Well…

10:27.001 --> 10:29.003
[Oliver cooing]

10:29.086 --> 10:30.296
Good day, Oliver.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.255
[chuckles]

10:31.881 --> 10:35.009
He is rather… wiggly, it seems.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.219
Yes. Very.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.138
Sir Philip is not here.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.807
He is out, studying his flowers.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.393
-If I had known you were coming--
-No, of course.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.357
I must offer my apologies
for the surprise.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.818
I was staying with my family
when I discovered you lived so nearby.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.072
I thought that I should come
to see that you were well, after…

10:57.073 --> 10:58.949
well, everything.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.410
I am well. Very well, in fact.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.371
I'm pleased to see you, Colin.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.374
Would you like some tea?

11:06.457 --> 11:07.416
Very much.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.088
Hello.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.173
[soft classical tune playing]

11:29.021 --> 11:32.942
Hopefully, the festivities are living up
to your expectations, Miss Edwina?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.527
Very much, Your Grace.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.488
You and your mama
are such diligent hostesses.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.907
I so look forward to hosting
my own gatherings one day.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.536
Well, there is certainly pleasure
to be had in acting as hostess.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.954
Though, between you and I,

11:45.037 --> 11:47.206
I think you will find
there is no greater pleasure

11:47.289 --> 11:49.709
than enjoying your home
alone with your family.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.087
With your husband,
as long as you choose the right one.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.715
I do think I know
what I desire in a match.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.757
And what is that?

11:56.841 --> 11:59.427
I should like to be
with someone kind and gentle.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.469
[Lady Danbury chuckles]

12:00.553 --> 12:02.763
-[Mary] Mm.
-Someone like your brother.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.432
He's so even-tempered.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.143
[chuckling] Anthony? Even-tempered?

12:07.852 --> 12:11.147
-You would not describe him as such?
-Well, not exactly.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.109
Well, perhaps I bring out
the very best in him.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.486
And is that not
what a good marriage should mean?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.405
Bringing out each other's best?

12:19.947 --> 12:21.657
It is indeed, Miss Edwina.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.995
Has your sister gone off somewhere?

12:26.078 --> 12:27.163
-Hunting.
-Hunting?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.622
With your brother, in fact.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.833
I am having them spend the day together

12:30.916 --> 12:33.919
in the hopes of their finally
finding common ground.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.296
It seems the two of them

12:35.379 --> 12:38.966
do not exactly see eye-to-eye on occasion.
A good plan, is it not?

12:39.800 --> 12:40.634
Well,

12:41.469 --> 12:43.262
certainly an intriguing one.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.139
-[Edwina chuckles]
-[Daphne] Hmm.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.606
-[chuckles]
-If this goes wrong, it'll be your fault.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.108
[sighs] You must play along, Brother.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.487
Perhaps this is
the perfect opportunity to win her over.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.448
-[Anthony] Or to be shot dead by her.
-[Benedict chuckles]

13:02.948 --> 13:05.201
-[Jack] To the right, gents!
-[men chattering]

13:06.702 --> 13:07.828
Where are they going?

13:08.829 --> 13:10.498
Toward our camp, I believe.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.374
There are tracks
going off to the left. Look.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.418
In the moss. You can see the cloven shape.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.213
If we go to our camp now,
we may miss our quarry entirely.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.339
[horse snorts]

13:19.256 --> 13:20.758
Let us stay with the group.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.801
If we find nothing,

13:21.884 --> 13:24.220
I shall offer myself up
for your target practice.

13:26.764 --> 13:27.848
Very well.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.405
-Where did you learn--
-It is a rather--

13:45.783 --> 13:49.495
My father was a secretary
for a royal family in India.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.249
A family gracious enough
to let me hunt with them.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.669
-Even as a young lady.
-Then it seems you'll manage quite well.

13:57.711 --> 14:00.089
Much better than your maid
on her horse, let us hope.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.466
-[maid gasps and sighs]
-[both chuckling]

14:12.560 --> 14:13.936
-Lord Bridgerton--
-Yes?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.442
-[Jack] Here we are!
-[Benedict] Brother!

14:28.659 --> 14:31.036
I made some friends in Athens,
then continued along with them

14:31.120 --> 14:32.496
to Marousi and Chalcis.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.499
That is, after
a quick swim in the Petalioi Gulf,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.626
which is a word I now know how to say.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.754
Well, it sounds like a remarkable journey.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.548
Remarkable, yes,

14:42.631 --> 14:46.260
in that I seem to have
many remarks about it, do I not?

14:49.013 --> 14:50.598
I like your remarks, Colin.

14:53.058 --> 14:56.770
-It was good of you to come by.
-It was good of you to have me as well.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.357
[exhales] Everything is well
with Sir Philip, then, I take it?

15:01.358 --> 15:03.027
I suppose you can ask him yourself.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.111
My lord,

15:04.820 --> 15:07.364
you have caught our visitor
before he departs.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.366
-This is Mr. Colin Bridgerton.
-[Philip] Ah.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.579
Mr. Bridgerton.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.289
Sir Philip Crane.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.542
-A pleasure to meet you at last.
-Ah.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.460
Yes.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.463
Your wife has been kind enough

15:22.546 --> 15:24.840
to let me drone on
about my recent Grecian adventures.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.217
-[Philip] You were in Greece?
-Mm-hmm.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.969
Did you visit
the olive orchards in Lesvos?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.472
I certainly did. I oiled my way right in.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.851
-That was an olive joke.
-[Philip] They are wonderful.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.812
You know, those trees have been there
since the third century BC.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.899
-Have they really?
-It is extraordinary. As is the botany.

15:42.524 --> 15:46.111
I must show you my copy of Flora Graeca.
You will join us for dinner?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.114
I am sure Mr. Bridgerton
is eager to return to his family.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.116
[Colin] Not at all. My family can wait.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.203
-I should very much like to stay.
-Good. We shall set you a place, then.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.373
Very well.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.129
It seems our stag may be eluding us.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.632
The elusiveness is part of the fun.

16:06.715 --> 16:09.551
-And you cannot fault the sunshine.
-No, certainly not.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.680
The men out enjoying the sunshine.
A sign of a great hunt.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.684
I suppose you prefer the darkness,
Miss Sharma? [chuckles]

16:17.351 --> 16:18.227
What I would prefer

16:18.310 --> 16:20.813
is to be allowed to follow
my own instincts on this hunt

16:20.896 --> 16:23.023
instead of blindly following the guide.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.155
You are still convinced
we have lost our prey?

16:31.532 --> 16:35.494
[Kate] I am convinced
that deer prefer the edge of the forest.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.413
This is much too open out here.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.873
Uh, yes, well,

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
perhaps you are right,
but we should carry on.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.339
Certainly there'll be
other deer on other paths.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.718
They do not always keep together.
And if there are not, then…

16:52.886 --> 16:53.887
Miss Sharma?

16:54.471 --> 16:55.681
[maid sighs and grunts]

16:58.767 --> 17:00.185
Keep her with you. [exhales]

17:04.314 --> 17:05.649
[gasps] Ooh.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.532
I quite like Lord Westbridge,
though his hands certainly do wander

17:13.615 --> 17:14.575
when he dances.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.743
At least he is young.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.120
My mama has fixed on
Sir Derryworth for me.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.538
His breath is excruciating.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.582
-Why do you not just say no?
-To our mamas?

17:21.665 --> 17:25.419
-I do not think it is that simple, El.
-I do everything my mama says.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.755
[chuckling] Yet you still wonder
why you're so miserable.

17:27.838 --> 17:31.175
Oh, I… [chuckles] …I know how to find
my happiness, Miss Bridgerton.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.677
There is always Lady Whistledown.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.720
[soft chuckling]

17:35.304 --> 17:37.514
Though I doubt she'll publish
anything of note this week.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.099
What can you mean?

17:39.183 --> 17:42.936
We are all here,
enjoying the countryside together.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.148
Anything she might print,
surely we will already know.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.316
Is that so?

17:50.778 --> 17:52.488
Uh, is it not my turn, Mama?

17:52.571 --> 17:54.948
Your turn will come
tomorrow night at the ball.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.951
It may be your very last chance
to charm Lord Featherington

17:58.035 --> 18:01.288
before Cressida Cowper
becomes your new mama.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.998
-Ooh.
-Oh.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.501
I would rather move to Cornwall

18:05.584 --> 18:08.295
than compete with Cressida. She is vile.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.507
Do you know what is vile?

18:12.007 --> 18:14.343
Fish head pie. It's a Cornish delicacy.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.260
Ew.

18:16.804 --> 18:21.058
I fear you are not taking this
as seriously as you need to, Prudence.

18:21.558 --> 18:25.354
After everything last year
with Miss Thompson, Mr. Bridgerton,

18:25.437 --> 18:28.982
and then your father,
we cannot afford any more scrutiny

18:29.066 --> 18:31.819
should you finally wish
to secure a match this season.

18:31.902 --> 18:35.906
Oh, Mama, it is not as if anyone
truly knows what Miss Thompson attempted.

18:36.615 --> 18:40.035
And is entrapping a man
in marriage really so uncommon?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.248
[Prudence exclaims]

18:44.832 --> 18:47.167
I won! Look at that. [chuckles]

18:47.793 --> 18:49.128
Look at me, everyone!

18:55.384 --> 18:57.344
-Miss Sharma!
-[whispers] Shh. Get down.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.222
Are you quite serious?

19:00.305 --> 19:02.599
You cannot just go off like that
with your gun.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.019
-Your maid is having a terrible time.
-Would you be quiet?

19:08.397 --> 19:10.315
It is rather like you,
leaving everyone behind.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.860
No one wishes to hear
what you think you know about me.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.903
I do not need to think. I know.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.072
From the moment I saw
you riding alone in that park,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.032
it was obvious
that rules are meaningless to you.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.284
Oh, you and your rules.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.163
Perhaps if you had not been out
once again the other morning,

19:25.539 --> 19:28.375
we might not have been put
in such a difficult situation.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.045
Exactly which difficult situation
are you referring to, my lord?

19:32.129 --> 19:32.963
Your--

19:37.426 --> 19:38.927
-The other morning.
-When I was stung?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.637
After which you put my hand to your bosom.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.639
To show you I was unharmed.
You were overcome.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.474
-Indeed I was not.
-You then looked at me.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.143
-You looked at me!
-Not the way you did.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.477
And how exactly did I look?

19:48.812 --> 19:49.688
[exhales]

19:50.898 --> 19:51.857
[exhales]

19:52.524 --> 19:54.151
-[exhales]
-[foliage rustles]

19:57.321 --> 19:59.031
[softly] There is something there.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.744
It'll signify little if you mean
to hold your gun in that way.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.205
-I know how to hold a gun.
-Evidently not a British one.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.081
-[exhales]
-You have to--

20:09.208 --> 20:11.168
-I require no instruction.
-Here.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.295
Just hold it…

20:16.256 --> 20:17.341
like this.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.844
[exhales]

20:36.068 --> 20:38.320
[Jack] This way, boys.
I saw movement over here.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.988
There the two of you are.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.033
Well, you better rejoin us

20:44.117 --> 20:45.911
before the rain ends our pursuits.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.913
[thunder rumbling]

20:47.996 --> 20:49.915
[rain pattering]

20:57.631 --> 21:00.759
[Philip] Sibthorp brought his illustrator
along for a grand tour, like your own,

21:00.842 --> 21:03.929
and came back
with these marvelous drawings.

21:04.012 --> 21:07.015
Oh, these are coronopifolia.
I saw so many of those in Paxos.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.309
Yes. Oh! Paxos is beautiful.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.478
And did you see
the mastic trees on Chios Island?

21:11.561 --> 21:15.691
I am sure Mr. Bridgerton
did not only go to Greece to see plants.

21:15.774 --> 21:16.817
No.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.569
But I'm grateful to you
for indulging my desire

21:19.653 --> 21:21.280
to talk about my travels, Sir Philip.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.658
Well, Lady Crane is right.
I am often carried away by my interests.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.451
How was your day, my dear?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.495
Apart from the arrival
of our interesting visitor.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.914
It was very pleasant. Thank you, my lord.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.211
It is getting late and, Mr. Bridgerton,
won't you need to return to your family?

21:36.295 --> 21:39.047
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
I lost track of time.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.383
Thank you
for your hospitality, Sir Philip.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.051
You are always welcome.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.306
Marina, I shall look in upon the babies
as you bid each other farewell.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.897
He is most amiable.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.569
Did you come all this way
to form your opinion of my husband, Colin?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.948
-No.
-Then… why did you come?

22:06.658 --> 22:07.492
I…

22:09.244 --> 22:10.454
I came to apologize.

22:12.372 --> 22:16.043
Throughout my travels, I kept pondering
how I left things between us.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.128
All of those terrible things
I said to you.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.048
-Colin, there is no need--
-I want you to know that I am sorry.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.176
And that I forgive you as well.

22:24.259 --> 22:28.180
I do not need your apology
any more than I desire your forgiveness.

22:28.263 --> 22:31.475
All of this, you and I, is in the past.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.517
[Colin] So it seems.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.355
But do you not look at your life
and wonder what may have been

22:36.438 --> 22:38.106
if we had conducted ourselves differently?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.025
[Marina] That is a fool's form of torture.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.985
I have left the past behind.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.362
You should do the same.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.032
Marina,

22:47.616 --> 22:49.910
he is truly amiable.

22:49.993 --> 22:53.330
But… well, you do not seem happy with him.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.665
You have only been here a few short hours.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.418
-I do not mean to offend you.
-I am not offended.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.253
Nor am I angry.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.963
You are a boy

23:02.047 --> 23:04.341
caught up in his own fantasies.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.926
In truth, I once thought

23:06.009 --> 23:08.470
that would be enough
to save me from my reality.

23:08.553 --> 23:12.265
But what I learned is,
I do not need saving in that way.

23:13.517 --> 23:17.687
What I need is to face up to my life
and make my own practical decisions.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.940
So you choose to be unhappy?

23:20.023 --> 23:22.275
We are not all guaranteed
a fairy-tale ending.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.569
I am perfectly content with my children.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.739
And Sir Philip cares for me.
He is a good father.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.408
We have built a life together.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.785
I am not the same woman you once knew.

23:32.411 --> 23:36.081
And I refuse to be thrust back
into such a world of fantasy.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.958
That dream has long since passed.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.085
-Marina--
-You need to wake up, Colin.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.884
Perhaps I have been a fool.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.930
I thank you for your time,

23:53.265 --> 23:54.307
Lady Crane.

23:57.018 --> 24:00.105
If you would simply open your eyes
to what is in front of you,

24:00.188 --> 24:03.692
then you might see there are those
in your life you already make happy.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.154
-And who would that be?
-You have your family.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.363
You have

24:10.031 --> 24:10.907
Penelope.

24:10.991 --> 24:11.867
Penelope?

24:11.950 --> 24:14.286
You have many people who care for you.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.329
Seek them out,

24:16.413 --> 24:20.167
because your future will certainly
not be found in the past with me.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.087
Very well.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.258
Goodbye, Marina.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.726
-[door opens]
-[dog panting]

24:40.061 --> 24:41.062
[exhales]

24:41.855 --> 24:44.065
-How did it go?
-Edwina, you frightened me.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.108
Tell me everything.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.528
We did not successfully shoot anything.
Perhaps if the men had listened to me--

24:48.612 --> 24:50.864
Oh, I do not care about the hunt, Didi.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.034
How did it go with the viscount?

24:55.118 --> 24:56.077
Well.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.206
It went well, I think.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.125
Did the two of you
finally warm to one another?

25:03.126 --> 25:04.544
[thunder rumbling]

25:04.628 --> 25:05.462
We did.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.838
[sighs softly]

25:07.714 --> 25:10.300
Oh! You must keep doing
whatever it is you are doing.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.469
At the ball. Tomorrow night.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.514
[giggles softly]

25:15.597 --> 25:16.681
[sighs]

25:28.693 --> 25:30.070
[thunder cracks]

25:31.404 --> 25:32.906
[exhales deeply]

25:36.326 --> 25:39.371
[thunder cracks, rumbles]

25:45.669 --> 25:47.212
-[thunderclap]
-[gasps softly]

25:52.467 --> 25:54.678
[thunder crackling]

25:59.307 --> 26:00.684
-[thunderclap]
-[gasps]

26:18.451 --> 26:19.786
[door opens]

26:20.870 --> 26:22.038
[door closes]

26:22.122 --> 26:24.124
[thunder rumbling]

26:29.546 --> 26:31.464
[door opens, creaks]

26:32.173 --> 26:34.175
-Lord Bridgerton.
-I did not mean to startle you.

26:35.552 --> 26:39.180
I saw a light and thought
I might have left a candle lit.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.640
No. Only me.

26:46.021 --> 26:46.938
Could you not sleep?

26:49.399 --> 26:52.527
-If your lodgings are not comfortable--
-No. It is the storm.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.404
I have always found them unsettling.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.950
My father used to read to me
during the monsoons.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.663
Now the rain makes me think of him.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.057
[Anthony] This is my father's library.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.434
These books were some of his most

27:25.435 --> 27:26.895
treasured possessions.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.447
How did he die?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.452
[exhales deeply]

27:42.535 --> 27:44.079
He was stung by a bee.

27:47.707 --> 27:48.875
My lord,

27:49.668 --> 27:52.420
I-- [sighs] I am so sorry. I--

27:53.004 --> 27:56.591
To see a great man felled
by such a small creature, it was, um…

28:00.845 --> 28:02.847
It was humbling, to say the least.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.700
-[thunderclap]
-[gasps] Oh!

28:21.783 --> 28:24.119
-This is not-- No.
-It is all right.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.121
I shall bid you good night.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.832
[footsteps departing]

28:30.333 --> 28:31.167
[sighs]

28:54.315 --> 28:57.402
How was your conversation
with Miss Edwina yesterday?

28:57.485 --> 28:59.487
-She is certainly a diamond.
-[chuckles]

28:59.988 --> 29:04.117
Knows exactly when to smile
and exactly what to say at all times.

29:05.785 --> 29:06.995
It is just that

29:07.704 --> 29:11.207
I've always imagined Anthony
to be with someone more like him.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.250
[scoffs]

29:12.333 --> 29:15.044
Sharp, quick, a little too exacting?

29:15.128 --> 29:16.337
[both chuckle lightly]

29:21.634 --> 29:24.763
You know, every time
I think my marriage has become simple,

29:25.346 --> 29:28.266
Simon and I find
some new stone to turn over,

29:28.349 --> 29:33.271
a new foible that one of us needs
the other to tease out and inspect.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.648
It is decidedly irritating.

29:35.732 --> 29:37.108
[laughs]

29:37.192 --> 29:39.444
Yet incredibly gratifying
at the same time.

29:43.573 --> 29:47.911
Miss Edwina is nearly perfect,
but Anthony is a Bridgerton.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.999
Is there not something in all of us
that requires a challenge?

29:54.959 --> 29:56.461
Indeed, there is.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.637
Brother.

30:07.013 --> 30:07.889
Sister.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.100
Mama has her ball all set for you.

30:12.393 --> 30:15.063
Just her? Are you to tell me
you have had no hand in it?

30:15.146 --> 30:17.315
Well, we have both
been planning, certainly.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.069
But our plans
do not require yours to be set.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.285
Miss Edwina, she is lovely.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.163
I am certain she will make a perfect wife.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.041
-Do you still not like her?
-I never said I did not like her.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.420
I only wonder if you truly
know each other well enough.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.839
Is that not what marriage is for?

30:40.922 --> 30:41.923
Well, yes, but

30:42.674 --> 30:45.802
it helps if you share similarities.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.514
Truly, Brother, is there really no one

30:49.597 --> 30:51.516
you share similarities with?
No one at all?

30:57.105 --> 30:59.899
How was your hunt
with the elder Miss Sharma yesterday?

31:01.401 --> 31:03.611
You have not mentioned anything about it.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.155
I certainly miss His Grace.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.326
In the Duke's absence,
you've become quite meddlesome,

31:10.410 --> 31:11.494
have you not?

31:13.913 --> 31:15.331
Do not concern yourself.

31:25.508 --> 31:28.261
[classical instrumental ensemble playing]

31:42.650 --> 31:44.777
Miss Edwina,
might I have your first dance?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.322
Certainly, my lord.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.799
Have you been enjoying
your time alone with the viscount?

32:09.052 --> 32:10.219
Yesterday's hunt.

32:11.304 --> 32:12.972
It went well, I take it?

32:13.056 --> 32:13.973
Oh, yes.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.808
Of course, yes. Quite well, indeed.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.477
[Lady Danbury] Mmm.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.573
Lord.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.493
She-- She's coming
towards me with a suitor.

32:33.576 --> 32:35.078
And what if you said yes?

32:35.161 --> 32:37.121
-To a dance?
-I only mean to say--

32:37.622 --> 32:40.667
It'd entertain me so much for you
to say yes to the dances you are offered

32:40.750 --> 32:42.043
so I might hear about them.

32:42.126 --> 32:45.421
There is only so much more
I can hear about a pamphlet. Never mind.

32:45.922 --> 32:47.548
Have you spoken to Colin about his visit--

32:47.632 --> 32:50.510
-[Eloise] No, no, no.
-Eloise. [chuckles]

32:50.593 --> 32:53.179
I would like to introduce you
to Lord Morrison.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.390
Miss Eloise. A pleasure.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.393
Might I have the honor?

33:00.853 --> 33:01.688
Of what?

33:01.771 --> 33:04.691
-[chuckles]
-[Violet chuckles] A dance, Eloise.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.986
Yes, I think you shall, Lord Morrison.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.570
Remember, hosts?

33:10.655 --> 33:12.865
-You wished to be entertained.
-[chuckles]

33:19.706 --> 33:20.623
[chuckles softly]

33:29.716 --> 33:30.550
Miss Eloise--

33:30.633 --> 33:33.636
Would you mind keeping quiet?
I am counting my steps, so… [chuckles]

33:33.720 --> 33:36.889
-"What worries you, masters you."
-Ah. You have read Locke?

33:37.473 --> 33:38.474
I have.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.101
-Have you?
-Yes.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.854
It is required of all men
past a certain age, surely.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.981
Not so much for young ladies.

33:45.064 --> 33:48.401
Because our feeble minds might collapse
if we put too many ideas in them.

33:48.484 --> 33:51.362
For most of the ladies
I have met, that seems to be true.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.823
Many of them
cannot even articulate a thought.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.952
Don't you think it's because they haven't
been offered the same opportunities?

33:58.036 --> 33:58.911
[sighs]

33:59.412 --> 34:03.374
I understand that you scorn
this farcical performance

34:03.458 --> 34:04.959
that is good society.

34:05.918 --> 34:10.131
What do you say we quit the dance floor
and add some brandy to the punch?

34:10.214 --> 34:11.257
[Eloise chuckles]

34:11.340 --> 34:14.594
You'd rather alter the punch
than engage in meaningful conversation?

34:15.428 --> 34:17.430
And you would rather count your steps.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.727
Perhaps I shall quit the dance floor, now.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.647
I do think we should finish this dance.
People are looking.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.483
-[chuckles]
-I see what masters you.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.777
Next time you compliment a woman,

34:30.860 --> 34:33.571
at least try not to insult
her entire sex in the process.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.115
[breathing heavily]

34:36.199 --> 34:37.241
Eloise.

34:39.368 --> 34:40.787
-[Violet] Eloise.
-[Eloise] What?

34:40.870 --> 34:43.623
I invited Lord Morrison
specifically for you.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.250
He is known
to share your rebellious spirit.

34:47.376 --> 34:51.756
My rebellion is not some party dress
I put on to play a part, Mama,

34:51.839 --> 34:54.383
and it's certainly not some accomplishment
I've developed,

34:54.467 --> 34:58.471
like singing or painting
to help me attract a suitor.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.348
I… know

35:01.057 --> 35:02.683
I am a disappointment to you.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.311
So just allow me
to take my leave and go to bed.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.234
[sobs softly]

35:11.317 --> 35:13.111
-El!
-[Eloise] I wish to be alone.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.074
[indistinct conversation]

35:18.157 --> 35:19.867
[Cressida chuckles]

35:19.951 --> 35:21.953
[all chuckling]

35:25.206 --> 35:28.042
Cousin Jack has not looked twice
at me all evening.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.380
You are excited. You need to calm yourself
if you are to attract interest.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.508
Why do you not take a walk
to the orangery?

35:35.591 --> 35:38.719
Breathe in the fragrant air.
It has always helped me.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.848
Mmm. I am hungry.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.433
Perhaps I shall purloin an orange?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.977
Yes, of course.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.354
Now, make haste, dear.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.327
I hate to interrupt, Miss Cowper,
but Lord Featherington,

36:03.411 --> 36:06.164
I believe Lord Fife
is looking for you in the orangery.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.623
Something about

36:08.207 --> 36:11.169
business, or your mines. I do not know.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.129
It sounded important.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.922
Pardon me, Miss Cowper.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.924
Of course, my lord.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.644
[classical ensemble continues]

36:40.698 --> 36:42.116
[song ends]

36:52.168 --> 36:53.961
Lord Bridgerton has gone
to get me a lemonade.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.048
-How very thoughtful of him.
-We've just finished our second dance.

36:57.131 --> 36:59.550
I'm certain he'd not have asked me for two

36:59.634 --> 37:02.011
if he did not have
intentions for the evening.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.597
I am pleased to hear that.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.140
-I need you to dance with him.
-What?

37:06.224 --> 37:09.477
If he is going to declare himself
before the end of the ball, as I hope,

37:09.560 --> 37:11.687
he shall need
to ask you for your blessing.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.900
And you are ready
to grant him your blessing, are you not?

37:20.071 --> 37:22.073
This may very well be my last chance.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.243
[Anthony] Miss Edwina.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.453
Lord Bridgerton.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.538
My sister and I were just speaking.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.542
-She wishes to take to the floor.
-Ah.

37:34.627 --> 37:37.088
-Well, I am certain that--
-[Edwina] With you.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.726
Miss Sharma, may I have this dance?

37:53.396 --> 37:54.438
[Kate] You may, my lord.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.657
[classical rendition of
"Dancing On My Own" playing]

39:40.336 --> 39:43.589
Do you have something you wish
to ask me, my lord, regarding my sister?

39:45.716 --> 39:48.636
If I were to ask for her hand,
would you give me your permission?

39:50.554 --> 39:52.681
I want my sister to be happy.

39:53.933 --> 39:57.311
-And do you think I can make her happy?
-That is a better question for you.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.896
Can you make her happy?

40:02.400 --> 40:05.486
If your silence is any indication
you are reconsidering your declaration--

40:05.569 --> 40:07.363
Is that what you want?
For me to reconsider?

40:07.947 --> 40:09.407
It does not matter what I want.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.075
I do not think that is true.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.203
I am to return to India

40:14.995 --> 40:16.997
the moment my sister marries.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.124
You will abandon her?

40:18.207 --> 40:20.584
Far from it, my lord. She will be married.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.295
She will not need me.
There'll be no more reason for me to stay.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.216
It was the plan all along.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.901
-Where is the viscount going?
-I-- I do not know.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.570
Well, what did you say?

40:48.821 --> 40:50.030
I… [sighs]

40:50.114 --> 40:51.115
I shall find him.

40:51.198 --> 40:52.324
Give me a moment.

40:56.370 --> 41:00.040
I took a tour earlier,
and you must see the orangery.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.461
The scent of the jasmine
is absolutely ambrosial.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.508
[gasping dramatically]

41:10.676 --> 41:11.927
Lord Featherington,

41:12.011 --> 41:15.097
what are you doing in a room
with my unchaperoned daughter?

41:15.181 --> 41:18.476
[clears throat] I found Prudence in here,
and neither of us were--

41:18.559 --> 41:19.727
Do not blame her.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.270
She is but an innocent girl,

41:21.353 --> 41:23.731
unknowing of the ways
of an older gentleman.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.567
-Mama, you--
-I assure you nothing untoward's occurred.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.277
I was to meet with Lord Fife.

41:30.112 --> 41:30.946
Featherington?

41:31.030 --> 41:34.492
How can you deny what is plain to the eye?
I saw you remove your arm

41:34.575 --> 41:36.827
from my Prudence's waist as I walked in.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.787
It is a scandal!

41:38.871 --> 41:42.041
Well, are you to marry the girl,
then, Featherington?

41:42.124 --> 41:44.126
-What?
-As a man of honor--

41:44.210 --> 41:46.212
He is hers in honor, should she wish it.

41:50.966 --> 41:51.842
Oh!

41:52.551 --> 41:53.636
[panting]

41:53.719 --> 41:54.637
Oh my!

41:55.387 --> 41:58.682
Oh, I would be delighted
to marry you, Cousin Jack. [laughs]

41:58.766 --> 41:59.850
[laughing] Yes!

41:59.934 --> 42:03.103
[Prudence laughing excitedly]

42:03.187 --> 42:05.481
[Prudence gasping, sighing]

42:09.401 --> 42:10.653
[Prudence giggles]

42:10.736 --> 42:12.154
[echoing laughter]

42:15.741 --> 42:17.034
Why are you so distressed?

42:17.618 --> 42:21.539
[breathing deeply]

42:21.622 --> 42:22.831
When will you leave?

42:25.668 --> 42:27.670
Immediately, once your sister is married?

42:27.753 --> 42:28.796
I presume so, yes.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.594
And you'll not concern yourself
with finding a match of your own?

42:35.678 --> 42:37.221
Why would that concern you?

42:38.681 --> 42:42.393
It seems to me you will find any excuse
you can to keep me away from your sister.

42:42.893 --> 42:45.646
That is it, is it not?
You simply do not like me.

42:45.729 --> 42:48.148
-Of course I do not like you--
-Then tell me why.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.944
Have I done something to you?

42:54.613 --> 42:57.783
Why is it that you dislike me so?

42:57.866 --> 42:59.451
Because… [panting]

42:59.535 --> 43:01.370
Because you vex me!

43:02.663 --> 43:06.083
And what is it,
do you think, you do to me?

43:07.293 --> 43:08.252
What?

43:09.211 --> 43:10.754
What do I do to you?

43:11.380 --> 43:13.382
[both panting]

43:14.216 --> 43:15.134
You…

43:19.513 --> 43:20.556
You hate me.

43:24.393 --> 43:25.352
[softly] Yes.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.229
I do.

43:27.313 --> 43:28.397
I hate you.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.780
[Anthony exhales]

43:41.660 --> 43:42.995
I am a gentleman.

43:45.998 --> 43:48.959
[softly] And your heart is with my sister.

43:49.043 --> 43:50.419
[softly] And my heart

43:51.378 --> 43:53.797
is with your sister.

43:59.553 --> 44:01.305
[softly] What are you doing?

44:02.598 --> 44:04.558
Say you do not care for me.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.441
Tell me you feel nothing,

44:13.359 --> 44:14.985
and I will walk away.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.198
[exhales] I feel…

44:22.368 --> 44:23.452
I feel…

44:26.205 --> 44:27.498
[door opens]

44:27.581 --> 44:28.499
Oh!

44:30.000 --> 44:31.877
-I am so sorry.
-Daphne.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.339
-[door closes]
-[exhales deeply]

44:35.422 --> 44:38.926
[breathing heavily]

44:45.265 --> 44:46.558
[door opens]

44:48.143 --> 44:49.645
It is not what you think.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.855
I am trying very much
not to think about it at all.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.565
-Daphne--
-You are courting her sister.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.734
And I have every intention
of bringing it to a point.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.361
-Why?
-Why?

44:58.153 --> 45:00.322
Because I am courting her.
Because I've decided.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.741
And I had decided last year
that I'd marry the prince

45:02.825 --> 45:05.619
until you caught me in the garden
with Simon at the Trowbridge Ball

45:05.703 --> 45:07.246
under very similar circumstances.

45:07.329 --> 45:09.790
Similar only in that I am a man
and Miss Sharma is a woman.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.417
And you were alone.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.293
Quite close to one another.

45:13.377 --> 45:17.131
Only there is one significant difference.
Nothing, in fact, happened.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.090
[scoffs]

45:18.882 --> 45:21.510
It is clear that you have
affection for Miss Sharma.

45:21.593 --> 45:23.887
The two of you cannot seem
to stay away from one another.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.556
Because she is aggravating!

45:25.639 --> 45:27.307
Oh, is that what I just witnessed?

45:27.391 --> 45:29.393
[Anthony breathes deeply]

45:40.738 --> 45:43.866
There is obviously something between you.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.411
And I know that this
is not as you would wish it,

45:47.494 --> 45:49.913
but you must be honest with yourself.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.542
Because, one way or another,
these kind of feelings

45:53.625 --> 45:56.086
always have a way
of coming to the surface.

45:56.879 --> 45:58.297
And what kind of feelings are those?

45:59.506 --> 46:00.382
Well,

46:01.258 --> 46:02.342
love.

46:09.808 --> 46:10.851
[exhales]

46:14.480 --> 46:16.064
Then I know what I must do.

46:17.858 --> 46:19.026
[chuckles softly]

46:25.324 --> 46:26.658
[door opens]

46:28.452 --> 46:30.788
I cannot believe
you are now betrothed, Sister.

46:31.705 --> 46:32.956
And to Cousin Jack.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.375
-[Prudence] Do not be jealous.
-I am not jealous.

46:35.876 --> 46:36.919
Prudence.

46:37.961 --> 46:39.046
How did it happen?

46:41.089 --> 46:42.925
I walked up, and Mama was saying…

46:44.718 --> 46:46.512
Did he compromise you?

46:46.595 --> 46:47.554
No.

46:48.222 --> 46:49.973
But I suppose it looked that way.

46:51.850 --> 46:54.311
-Did Mama send you there?
-Oh, what a scandal.

46:54.394 --> 46:56.939
Do you think Whistledown
will write about it? Of course she will.

46:57.022 --> 46:58.440
-How could she not?
-If she does--

46:58.524 --> 47:01.109
Prudence, if Whistledown
writes the full story,

47:01.193 --> 47:03.570
it's not some insult
about our citrus dresses.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.239
It could ruin our family.

47:05.322 --> 47:08.659
It could ruin you. It could ruin Mama.
We could be run out of town.

47:10.661 --> 47:11.620
Oh my.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.207
-You truly are jealous.
-[scoffs]

47:15.290 --> 47:16.792
If this was Mama's doing,

47:16.875 --> 47:18.877
there is no way Whistledown could know.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.880
Now my name will appear in Whistledown,

47:21.964 --> 47:23.048
and you…

47:24.258 --> 47:26.093
You will be just as you are now.

47:26.635 --> 47:27.594
-Prudence--
-Ah-ah.

47:28.262 --> 47:31.223
I believe it is
"Lady Featherington" now, to you.

47:34.059 --> 47:35.185
[sighs sharply]

47:49.283 --> 47:50.284
[cane taps]

47:50.951 --> 47:52.077
Lady Danbury.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.037
Uh, what are you doing still up?

47:54.121 --> 47:56.540
I could ask you the very same.

47:57.416 --> 47:59.376
It's cold out here.

48:00.210 --> 48:02.671
I am merely trying to let my sister sleep.

48:03.755 --> 48:05.883
I have been
tossing and turning far too much.

48:06.925 --> 48:08.927
Have you yet told your sister?

48:12.222 --> 48:14.266
About the inheritance scheme.

48:16.643 --> 48:17.686
I have not.

48:17.769 --> 48:18.854
Mmm.

48:18.937 --> 48:20.564
[Kate] At this point,

48:20.647 --> 48:23.025
I fear there is no point in telling her.

48:27.696 --> 48:30.574
Lady Danbury, I fear there may be

48:30.657 --> 48:32.576
no proposal from the viscount.

48:34.494 --> 48:37.039
I fear I have ruined it for Edwina.

48:37.122 --> 48:40.751
Because you two cannot get along?

48:46.381 --> 48:47.257
Yes.

48:48.592 --> 48:51.637
And why, when you are
so close to getting what you want,

48:52.429 --> 48:54.932
what you need for your family's survival,

48:55.015 --> 48:57.684
and what Edwina
so clearly wants for herself,

48:57.768 --> 49:00.354
are you getting in the way?

49:02.314 --> 49:03.273
I do not know.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.444
I do not know what to do.

49:07.527 --> 49:10.614
There is only one thing to do.

49:11.823 --> 49:14.910
Be honest with your sister,

49:14.993 --> 49:16.495
with yourself.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.957
You must tell her how you feel.

49:24.044 --> 49:25.963
About my dislike for the viscount?

49:26.046 --> 49:30.926
About whatever it is you feel.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.263
I am going inside.

49:36.598 --> 49:37.724
Careful.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.686
Or you shall catch a chill.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.166
[door opens]

50:05.002 --> 50:06.378
You cannot just come in here.

50:06.461 --> 50:09.756
Why? Because it's improper for a lady
and gentleman to be alone together?

50:14.386 --> 50:15.887
You arranged it all.

50:18.473 --> 50:21.226
I did what I had to do
to secure my family's future.

50:21.309 --> 50:22.144
And now--

50:22.227 --> 50:24.813
And now you've secured yourself
a future of poverty.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.816
You cannot just cast us out now, my lord.

50:27.899 --> 50:28.942
No, I cannot.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.652
I shall indeed marry Prudence.

50:30.736 --> 50:33.113
But you should know
she is marrying a penniless man.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.741
If you intend to hurt me
with your empty threats--

50:35.824 --> 50:38.535
The only empty thing I have
are those mines, Portia.

50:38.618 --> 50:39.619
They are a failure.

50:41.079 --> 50:42.414
I have nothing.

50:42.497 --> 50:44.082
You paid Philippa's dowry.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.209
I held off the Finches
with a promise of payment

50:46.293 --> 50:47.627
and a counterfeit ruby necklace.

50:47.711 --> 50:51.673
The only way for me to provide
for all of us was to marry wealth.

50:51.757 --> 50:52.966
Someone like--

50:53.050 --> 50:54.676
Miss Cressida Cowper.

50:58.138 --> 50:59.598
[exhales softly]

51:02.142 --> 51:03.143
Colin.

51:04.978 --> 51:07.981
We, uh, missed you at the ball last night.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.108
Yes. I fear I was not feeling up to it.

51:10.192 --> 51:11.985
After seeing Marina?

51:14.196 --> 51:15.614
How is she, Colin?

51:16.198 --> 51:18.575
She is… content.

51:18.658 --> 51:19.910
[sighs] Good.

51:21.244 --> 51:22.370
I am glad.

51:24.414 --> 51:27.793
Perhaps seeing her was what you needed.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.796
To leave the past behind.

51:32.005 --> 51:33.715
To no longer feel the need to

51:34.758 --> 51:35.926
forswear women.

51:36.009 --> 51:38.470
Lady Crane said she was content,

51:39.304 --> 51:41.264
but I cannot help but feel like…

51:42.724 --> 51:45.102
Well, we were all so hard on her.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.645
Myself included.

51:47.395 --> 51:49.773
Perhaps if Lady Whistledown
hadn't rushed to print her gossip,

51:49.856 --> 51:51.650
things may have
turned out differently for her.

51:52.526 --> 51:54.528
For all of us, in fact.

51:55.487 --> 51:59.074
But, I suppose,
there is no use dwelling on the past.

51:59.157 --> 52:01.159
I am, indeed, thinking of the future.

52:02.494 --> 52:03.870
Pardon me, Pen.

52:06.164 --> 52:08.792
[Lady Whistledown] Dearest gentle reader,

52:08.875 --> 52:12.838
while much occurred
at the Bridgerton country visit,

52:12.921 --> 52:17.008
this author feels not all is fit to print.

52:17.092 --> 52:20.637
Especially when so much is already known

52:20.720 --> 52:23.390
by far too many members of the ton.

52:23.974 --> 52:27.394
But if you thought we would reach
the end of this journey

52:27.477 --> 52:32.649
without this trusted author finding
a truly delectable morsel of gossip,

52:33.316 --> 52:35.443
then you are sorely mistaken.

52:39.239 --> 52:41.825
I am sorry things
did not go as planned, Bon.

52:42.450 --> 52:44.077
It is not your fault, Didi.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.329
We both did everything we could have done.

52:46.955 --> 52:49.541
The viscount's feelings
are clearly not there for me.

52:50.041 --> 52:51.585
Perhaps they are elsewhere.

53:13.356 --> 53:15.483
[Lady Whistledown]
While Prudence Featherington

53:15.567 --> 53:17.777
seems to have secured her match,

53:17.861 --> 53:21.072
it was not the only occurrence of note.

53:23.742 --> 53:24.743
[Kate] Edwina?

53:27.370 --> 53:29.206
There is something I must tell you.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.248
[Anthony] Wait.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.752
Lord Bridgerton.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.588
Might I speak with you?

53:36.671 --> 53:37.505
Of course.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.050
-[Anthony] That was meant for Miss Edwina.
-My lord?

53:41.301 --> 53:42.344
Miss Edwina Sharma.

53:49.392 --> 53:50.435
Will you marry me?

53:53.813 --> 53:54.689
Yes.

53:56.316 --> 53:57.943
[laughing] Yes! Yes!

53:58.026 --> 54:00.237
I shall be your viscountess.
I shall marry you.

54:01.196 --> 54:05.533
[Lady Whistledown]
Anthony Bridgerton is now betrothed

54:05.617 --> 54:08.286
to Miss Edwina Sharma.

54:22.801 --> 54:25.262
Victory, indeed.
