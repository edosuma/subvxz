00:06.625 --> 00:08.792
PJ, I've got good news and bad news.

00:09.667 --> 00:10.792
Okay, what's the bad news?

00:10.875 --> 00:13.041
It's time for the annual
fishing trip with dad.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.125
What's the good news?

00:14.208 --> 00:16.917
- It's your turn to go.
- What? Hold on!

00:17.000 --> 00:19.083
I went last year. It's your turn to go.

00:19.166 --> 00:22.542
Yeah, but when you're out of the house,
I'll be the one going every year.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.709
Come on, everyone knows I'm never leaving.

00:26.125 --> 00:29.792
Just can't hear that same
stupid joke dad tells every year.

00:29.875 --> 00:31.417
You mean the one where he passes gas

00:31.500 --> 00:34.250
and goes, "Hey, I didn't know
this was a motorboat"?

00:36.083 --> 00:39.375
Hey, boys, who wants
to go fishing with dad?

00:39.458 --> 00:40.542
- He does.
- He does.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.291
You know what? You can quit your arguing.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.250
'Cause this year I rented a bigger boat.
You both get to go.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.875
- Yay.
- Yay.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.333
I just hope it ain't a motorboat.

Why didn't you just look at my paper?

01:59.917 --> 02:01.667
That would be cheating.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.959
If I text, it's just friends hanging out.

02:07.041 --> 02:10.125
You spent the whole
weekend with her, Harry.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.750
- Should I leave?
- Mm-mm.

02:11.834 --> 02:13.125
They have this fight all the time.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.250
You should be home with your wife.

02:15.375 --> 02:18.125
Not out there with your hands
all over her.

02:18.208 --> 02:19.917
Her name is Gracie.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.917
I'm sorry. I can't just sit here
and listen to this.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
You two need to work this out.

02:24.083 --> 02:25.709
Now whoever this Gracie is--

02:25.792 --> 02:27.166
- She's a car.
- She's a car.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.375
Of course she's a car.

02:32.625 --> 02:33.917
I'm so glad I could help.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.000
She's an old car

02:36.083 --> 02:38.542
that's taking my spot in the garage.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.500
When are you gonna get rid of that thing?

02:40.583 --> 02:43.166
I am not selling my baby to some stranger.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.333
Actually, I've been thinking
about buying a car.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.083
Do you hear that, Harry?

02:48.166 --> 02:50.083
I don't know her that well.

02:51.041 --> 02:53.750
Oh, come on, she's practically family.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.500
Well I,

02:56.125 --> 02:57.959
I guess I could consider it.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.959
- Teddy, would you like to meet Grace?
- Sure.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.917
I'll take you right out
as soon as you wash your hands.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.208
Tomorrow is gonna be such a tough day.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.375
It sure is.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.041
You have no idea what tomorrow is, do you?

03:20.125 --> 03:22.125
No, ma'am, I do not.

03:23.959 --> 03:25.875
It's Charlie's first day of preschool.

03:25.959 --> 03:27.166
And I'm not looking forward to it

03:27.250 --> 03:28.875
because she's gonna be
crying and screaming

03:29.000 --> 03:30.709
and grabbing onto my legs
like all the kids did.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.083
Honey, if you want, I'll take her.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.166
And miss all that? Are you crazy?

03:36.625 --> 03:38.875
Hey, Mom, Dad, can I talk
to you guys for a sec?

03:38.959 --> 03:40.458
Sure, honey, what's up?

03:40.542 --> 03:44.375
Okay, so Ivy's dad has
offered to sell me his car.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.000
And I'd like to ask
for you guys to loan me the money.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.583
- Sure.
- Now before you say no,

03:48.667 --> 03:51.542
I made this presentation and-- wait. What?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.542
We said okay.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.542
'Cause the thing is,
I kinda spent a lot of time

03:57.625 --> 04:02.125
putting this presentation together
so I'd really like to present it.

04:03.417 --> 04:04.750
Goodness gracious,

04:04.834 --> 04:07.375
- there's lots of graphs and charts.
- Yes.

04:07.458 --> 04:10.208
I'll give you an extra
50 bucks if we can leave now.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.208
That concludes our presentation. Okay.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.542
Okay, here we go.

04:23.250 --> 04:24.625
It's the first day.

04:24.959 --> 04:26.875
It's not gonna be pretty.

04:27.834 --> 04:30.083
Okay, now...

04:30.792 --> 04:33.041
Mommy needs you to be brave, okay?

04:33.917 --> 04:36.583
And I promise I'm gonna come back
real soon to pick you up, okay?

04:36.667 --> 04:39.333
- Okay.
- Great. Big hugs.

04:44.291 --> 04:46.208
That was easy.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.625
I'm so happy that was so easy.

05:00.417 --> 05:03.667
- What happened to you?
- Sprained my arm so I can't go fishing.

05:04.667 --> 05:05.917
What happened to you?

05:06.250 --> 05:07.583
Sprained my eye.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.083
- Aw, forget it.
- This isn't gonna work.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.500
Why do we always have to go fishing?

05:14.583 --> 05:16.667
Why can't dad go with one of his friends?

05:16.875 --> 05:18.041
Wait a minute.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.250
You just said something
really interesting.

05:20.375 --> 05:22.667
I did? Oh shoot.
Now I wish I had been listening.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.667
If we can get Dad
to take some of his friends fishing,

05:26.750 --> 05:28.625
then we don't have to go.

05:28.709 --> 05:31.333
You're right. Okay, who are Dad's friends?

05:31.417 --> 05:32.750
Um...

05:35.000 --> 05:36.083
He doesn't have any.

05:38.250 --> 05:39.709
- Are you sure?
- Think about it.

05:39.792 --> 05:42.917
Have you ever answered the door
and said, "Dad, your friends are here?"

05:43.000 --> 05:46.041
So all we gotta do is find Dad a friend.

05:46.125 --> 05:47.500
You mean like fix him up?

05:47.583 --> 05:48.709
That's right.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.792
We gotta get Dad a dude.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.083
Well...

06:01.792 --> 06:03.709
I guess this is goodbye.

06:03.792 --> 06:06.083
Mr. Wentz,

06:06.166 --> 06:08.041
would you like a moment alone?

06:08.125 --> 06:10.041
He slept in the back seat last night.

06:10.125 --> 06:13.500
Well, I just wanna make sure
that you really wanna do this.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.166
So you really wanna sell your car?

06:15.250 --> 06:18.250
- Well--
- Mrs. Wentz: He's selling the car!

06:20.750 --> 06:22.750
Teddy, before you go,

06:23.250 --> 06:25.542
would you take a picture
of me and my special girl?

06:25.750 --> 06:27.000
Sure.

06:32.583 --> 06:33.834
I meant Gracie.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.959
Of course you did.

06:45.333 --> 06:48.083
Hey, honey, how'd Charlie's
first day of school go?

06:48.166 --> 06:49.291
Awful.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.625
Oh no, what happened? She make a scene?

06:51.709 --> 06:54.625
No, she didn't.
She just walked through the door

06:54.709 --> 06:56.250
without a care in the world.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.041
What was the awful part?

06:59.709 --> 07:00.917
I just told you.

07:02.875 --> 07:04.041
But I know what the problem is.

07:04.125 --> 07:07.542
Mm-hmm. Charlie is the fourth child.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.458
So I didn't get to spend
enough time with her.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.166
We did not get enough bonding.

07:11.709 --> 07:14.959
Ah. Okay, so with more bonding,

07:15.041 --> 07:17.959
then she'll cry
when you drop her off at school,

07:18.041 --> 07:20.041
and that's a good thing?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.375
Yes.

07:24.959 --> 07:26.250
Okay, try and stay with me, Bob.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.083
You seem a little slow today.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.333
Hey guys, I think Teddy
just pulled up in her new car.

07:31.417 --> 07:34.291
- Hey! Let's go check it out.
- Yeah.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.166
Is it noticeable?

07:50.333 --> 07:51.917
Honey, are you okay?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.083
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.
- Well, what happened?

07:54.166 --> 07:56.834
I was driving home and in the middle of
the road there was this squirrel.

07:56.917 --> 07:59.667
So you swerved to avoid it
and you hit something?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.834
- No, I stopped and I honked.
- So then someone hit you?

08:01.917 --> 08:04.500
This is my accident. Let me tell it.

08:04.583 --> 08:08.458
Anyway, I got out of my car
and I tried to chase it off,

08:08.542 --> 08:10.041
but it was stuck to this huge wad of gum.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.583
What flavor?

08:12.417 --> 08:13.583
Who cares?

08:14.333 --> 08:17.500
By the way, to get back
to the earlier conversation,

08:17.917 --> 08:19.875
PJ had the most bonding time.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.709
Anyway, while I was staring
at the squirrel,

08:24.792 --> 08:26.834
a garbage truck
was backing out of an alley

08:26.917 --> 08:29.041
and it smashed right into the car.

08:29.125 --> 08:31.417
Do you think it can be fixed?

08:31.500 --> 08:33.959
Honey, you know,
I'm afraid it's gonna cost more

08:34.041 --> 08:35.667
to fix than the car is worth.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.500
This is awful.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.125
What's Mr. Wentz
gonna say when he finds out?

08:42.834 --> 08:44.125
Baby!

08:44.208 --> 08:45.875
I bet he says baby.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.250
Hey!

08:57.333 --> 09:01.208
It's my friend Jimmy's dad here
to pick up my friend Jimmy.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.083
Come in, say hi to my dad.

09:04.166 --> 09:06.250
- Hi, I'm Mark.
- Bob.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.500
I knew you guys would hit it off.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.917
So you're Jimmy's dad?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.083
Yeah.

09:15.709 --> 09:16.917
And you're Gabe's.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.667
What don't you guys have in common?

09:20.125 --> 09:22.542
So, uh, where is Jimmy?

09:22.750 --> 09:25.542
Dad, please, we're focusing
on Jimmy's dad.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.000
Who is also wondering where Jimmy is.

09:28.083 --> 09:31.458
Guys, enough with the Jimmy.

09:33.125 --> 09:36.542
There are other things
to talk about besides Jimmy,

09:36.625 --> 09:38.959
like fishing, which I know you both love.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.333
Ah, not me. I can't do anything outdoorsy.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.041
- Allergies.
- Oh.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.041
Hmm.

09:45.542 --> 09:48.166
Sure wish Jimmy would have mentioned
that in the pre-interview.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.000
Hey-- oh, sorry.

09:51.083 --> 09:52.500
Dad, I didn't realize you had company.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.542
Bring your guy in.
My guy's not working out.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.083
I just remembered
Jimmy left about an hour ago.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.417
Bye-bye.

10:01.542 --> 10:04.458
Dad, there's somebody
I am dying for you to meet.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.333
This is... What's your name again?

10:07.417 --> 10:09.166
- Roger.
- Right.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.750
Roger, this is my dad Bob.

10:11.834 --> 10:12.834
Here you go.

10:12.917 --> 10:14.083
- How you doing?
- Hey.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.834
Tell my dad what you just ordered.
Dad, wait'll you hear this.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.041
This is going to blow your mind.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.834
The kwikki fishy combo.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.375
The guy comes into
a chicken place and orders fish.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.917
He loves fish. You love to fish.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.333
Roger, Bob, perfect together.

10:36.375 --> 10:39.792
Actually, I ordered the fish for my wife.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.750
I hate fish.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.000
Tease.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.792
All right, come on, let's go.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.208
Gabe, what is going on?

10:52.291 --> 10:54.750
What's going on is
you better stop being so fussy, mister,

10:54.834 --> 10:57.583
or you're gonna end up alone.

11:02.542 --> 11:05.750
Okay, Charlie,
are you ready to have some fun?

11:06.083 --> 11:09.000
Because today is Mommy and Charlie day.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.542
Yay!

11:12.542 --> 11:14.417
Okay, let's try that again.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.625
Today is Mommy and Charlie day.

11:18.709 --> 11:20.834
Yay!

11:26.667 --> 11:28.208
Boy, we got some work to do.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.917
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.542
We're gonna play hide and seek, okay?

11:33.625 --> 11:35.458
Cover your eyes and count to ten.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.875
One, two...

11:40.959 --> 11:42.458
Here we come.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.208
Ahh, you found me.

We laughed. We played.

12:33.542 --> 12:35.250
We sang.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.333
Oh.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.250
You are so gonna cry tomorrow.

12:43.917 --> 12:47.000
Look who got out of bed, everybody.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.875
- Hi, Mr. Wentz.
- Oh, hello, Teddy.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.917
Hello, Ivy. Hello, hello Mary Lou.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.792
Honey, we said our hellos
at the top of the stairs, remember?

12:58.166 --> 13:00.041
Right right.

13:01.709 --> 13:04.000
I came by to see how you're doing

13:04.083 --> 13:08.166
and to say again,
I'm so sorry about Gracie.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.625
Oh, that's okay, Teddy.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.709
I guess it was just her time.

13:15.667 --> 13:18.583
I just wish I had a chance to say goodbye.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.667
Oh, hello, Mary Lou.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.834
Okay, let's get you a cup of tea, okay?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.166
- Come on.
- Bye.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.333
- Wow.
- Yeah.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.000
This is awful.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.166
I wish there was
some way I could help him.

13:35.250 --> 13:39.041
Hey, your dad said that
he just wanted to say goodbye, right?

13:39.125 --> 13:42.000
- Right.
- So he just needs closure.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.041
I know how to do that.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.834
Uh-oh. You got that crazy
look in your eye.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.417
No, no, this isn't crazy at all.
This is good. This could work.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.250
Now, did your dad and the car
have a special song?

13:59.583 --> 14:03.375
Okay, day number two.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.625
Not gonna be easy.

14:06.250 --> 14:10.208
All right, Charlie,
we had a lot of fun yesterday, didn't we?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.750
Yeah, we did.

14:11.834 --> 14:14.542
So today's gonna be
really hard for you, okay?

14:14.625 --> 14:15.917
You might wanna cry.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
It's okay. It's okay if you wanna cry.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.458
But I was the Jack in the box.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.333
Oh. That's my baby.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.083
See that? She can't let go.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.750
Oh hey, dad.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.917
Um... what's this?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.667
We're just having a little mixer

14:57.750 --> 14:59.750
with the guys
from Billy's bait and tackle shop.

15:00.125 --> 15:04.000
Yeah, here, grab a drink.
Mingle. Don't be shy.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.667
Okay, you two in the kitchen. Now.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.333
We'll be right back.

15:13.417 --> 15:16.458
If you guys get hungry,
there are fish crackers and yummy worms.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.875
Water, fresh or salt.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.458
All right, what's going on?

15:23.542 --> 15:24.375
Nothing.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.458
Just a couple kids
having a bait shop party.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.917
That's all.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.417
You guys don't wanna go
fishing with me, do you?

15:30.625 --> 15:33.083
Well, I wanna go fishing with you.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.917
- No, you don't.
- No, I really don't.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.917
Do you think when I ask you to go fishing,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.333
it's 'cause I wanna go fishing?

15:39.417 --> 15:42.333
Careful. This has all the signs
of a trick question.

15:43.458 --> 15:47.125
Guys, I just wanna
spend time with my sons.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.500
I don't care what we do,

15:49.583 --> 15:51.083
just so long we do it together.

15:51.166 --> 15:55.000
So we can do something else
besides fishing?

15:55.083 --> 15:56.709
Guys, there's all sorts
of things we can do.

15:56.792 --> 15:58.542
We can go golfing.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.625
We can go bowling.
We can go to the movies. I don't care.

16:01.709 --> 16:02.959
- I vote for the movies.
- Yeah.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.917
But uh, we're not sitting with you.

16:06.625 --> 16:07.709
Why not?

16:07.792 --> 16:10.959
Well, you know how popcorn
affects your stomach?

16:11.041 --> 16:12.500
And then you make that joke,

16:12.583 --> 16:14.417
"This movie must be rated P.U."

16:18.125 --> 16:19.875
I got one for every venue.

16:32.917 --> 16:35.542
Okay, all right,
we're gonna get started, everyone.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.417
I'd like to thank you all
for coming and joining us

16:38.500 --> 16:42.750
for a celebration of the life
of Gracie Wentz.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.542
Now there's so many people here

16:47.625 --> 16:51.333
that loved Gracie--
her family, her friends,

16:51.417 --> 16:53.333
Roy from Roy's automotive.

16:53.417 --> 16:57.041
I know. I know.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.625
What can I say about Gracie?

17:02.291 --> 17:03.792
She was a giver.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.291
In fact, she gave her life

17:07.375 --> 17:09.583
so that a squirrel could live.

17:09.667 --> 17:12.291
Now unfortunately, that squirrel
couldn't be with us today,

17:12.375 --> 17:14.625
but if it could, I know it would say...

17:14.709 --> 17:16.291
"Thank you."

17:19.834 --> 17:22.917
Does anyone else have any memories
they would like to share of Gracie?

17:23.625 --> 17:24.750
Ivy.

17:27.083 --> 17:28.375
Come on, sweetie. You got it.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.959
My first memory of Gracie

17:34.041 --> 17:35.917
was when I was five years old.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.959
We were in the garage and dad said,

17:39.041 --> 17:40.583
"Don't touch the car."

17:40.667 --> 17:42.500
That's right. He did.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.542
Then when I was seven,

17:45.917 --> 17:48.667
Dad was washing her and he said to me,

17:49.083 --> 17:51.083
"Don't touch the car."

17:51.166 --> 17:53.291
- Then when I was around nine--
- Oh oh oh,

17:53.375 --> 17:55.000
I-I think what Ivy is trying to say

17:55.083 --> 17:58.166
is that even though
she never touched the car, right?

17:58.250 --> 18:01.000
The car touched her.

18:02.917 --> 18:05.542
No, I'm saying I wasn't
allowed to touch the car.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.291
Okay, Ivy, I think you're done.

18:12.750 --> 18:16.417
Now Mary Lou Wentz
would like to dedicate a song

18:16.500 --> 18:19.750

19:38.834 --> 19:42.041
Well, Charlie, we both hit
big milestones this week.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.875
Um, you started preschool
and I got my first car.

19:45.959 --> 19:49.458
Unfortunately, my milestone only lasted...

19:49.542 --> 19:50.834
A mile.

19:54.041 --> 19:57.208
Anyway, turns out you're very independent,
which is a good thing.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.625
Not all Duncan kids let go so easily.

20:04.625 --> 20:06.166
Do it again. Do it again.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.542
Of course I will, honey.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.917
Seen enough? I know I have.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.083
Good luck, Charlie.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.458
