02:46.618 --> 02:48.142
Oh, man!

02:49.387 --> 02:50.649
Did you see that?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.586
Oh, my God.

02:55.627 --> 02:57.652
- Yes! Yes!
- Nice, nice, nice.

02:57.696 --> 02:59.027
- Aw, sick!
- Worth the wait.

02:59.064 --> 03:00.053
Oh, babe. You missed out.

03:00.098 --> 03:01.087
Yes!

03:01.133 --> 03:03.534
I want to get off.

03:18.184 --> 03:19.515
That was intense, man.

03:19.552 --> 03:21.782
To feel how that would be
to just crash and burn like that.

03:21.821 --> 03:24.619
Yeah, yeah. Maybe for you,
but our lives are actually goin' somewhere.

03:24.657 --> 03:26.784
Oh! OK, well, where we gotta go
is to the roller coaster.

03:26.826 --> 03:28.623
'Cause our pass is for 9:15.

03:28.661 --> 03:30.060
If we miss that,
we'll stand in line...

03:30.096 --> 03:31.290
for, like, a day and a half,
and that's gonna kill me.

03:31.330 --> 03:32.319
- OK!
- All right?

03:32.365 --> 03:33.333
So let's go.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.858
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

03:35.903 --> 03:38.565
OK. Come on, it won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

03:38.605 --> 03:41.039
Before ridin' Devil's Flight?
Yeah, that might kill me.

03:41.074 --> 03:44.202
No! What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

04:02.696 --> 04:03.993
Oh, I'll take that.

04:04.031 --> 04:05.659
No. Come on, gimme.
It's not even mine, Kevin.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.031
It's the yearbook's.
Just... Kevin.

04:08.069 --> 04:09.730
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.569
- Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey. Gimme the...

04:14.509 --> 04:15.703
- Ow!
- Nice.

04:15.743 --> 04:18.439
Um, could you, like,
please delete that one of Stacy?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.712
These are for the yearbook.

04:21.749 --> 04:23.876
And I have to turn them in tomorrow
to make a deadline...

04:23.918 --> 04:26.944
and, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

04:26.988 --> 04:28.148
is gonna make it in there.

04:28.189 --> 04:29.281
Whew. I'd buy two.

04:30.625 --> 04:31.990
Number 38, your order's ready.

04:32.026 --> 04:34.051
That's us.

04:34.095 --> 04:35.563
I am so sorry.

04:35.598 --> 04:37.156
Kevin can get so out of control.

04:37.199 --> 04:40.100
Let me just say
he would make me crazy.

04:40.135 --> 04:42.535
Ha! I mean, you know
I'm such a control freak...

04:42.571 --> 04:45.335
like I couldn't handle that.

04:49.011 --> 04:50.273
I'm breaking up with him.

04:50.312 --> 04:53.372
Couple of weeks.
After graduation.

04:53.415 --> 04:54.746
I've been wanting to for a while.

04:54.783 --> 04:57.377
But don't tell anybody, OK?

04:58.754 --> 05:01.518
Now, that shot there?
That'll sell some yearbooks.

05:02.524 --> 05:04.048
- I love it.
- I love it.

05:04.093 --> 05:08.428
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

05:08.465 --> 05:09.955
Come on, go, go, go,
go, go, go go!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.400
Oh, my God, Ashley, you're winning.
You're totally winning.

05:12.435 --> 05:14.460
- Am I winning?
- Yeah, come on, hurry!

05:14.504 --> 05:16.369
OK, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

05:17.574 --> 05:18.973
Am I winning? Look around,
I don't want to look.

05:19.009 --> 05:20.237
You're totally winning.

05:20.277 --> 05:21.335
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

05:21.378 --> 05:23.744
- Don't look!
- Oh, my God! Come on!

05:23.780 --> 05:26.078
Oh, my God!
I'm winning! I'm winning!

05:28.985 --> 05:31.044
- I won!
- I knew you would.

05:31.087 --> 05:33.715
Oh, my God! Gimme my prize.

05:33.757 --> 05:35.281
- Good job.
- That was so awesome, Ashley.

05:35.325 --> 05:36.383
Ashley.

05:41.465 --> 05:44.992
How ya doin', my brother?
You havin' a good time, huh?

05:46.604 --> 05:48.629
You like that?

05:48.673 --> 05:51.574
Yeah! You like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

05:53.511 --> 05:54.773
Sam!

06:00.351 --> 06:01.875
Excuse me.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.319
You're not a senior.

06:05.356 --> 06:06.755
And what are
you gonna do about it...

06:06.791 --> 06:10.023
Miss "Cutest Couple,"
Rah Rah?

06:10.062 --> 06:11.791
Mom know you're here?

06:13.332 --> 06:15.527
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.501
Proof where you were.

06:17.536 --> 06:19.163
Take a shot of this.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.070
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

06:29.114 --> 06:30.979
# That is three, number three #

06:31.016 --> 06:33.917
# Oh, I'm the man, I'm the man #
Man, I am hot.

06:33.952 --> 06:35.112
- Man, gimme some right here, man.
- Right here! Right here!

06:35.153 --> 06:37.314
What you doin'?
Get the fuck back.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.655
My God, I am good. Here we go.

06:39.692 --> 06:42.058
Boy, I'll tell ya...
Goddamn.

06:42.095 --> 06:43.892
Kind sir, step right up!

06:43.930 --> 06:45.898
There ya go. Whaddaya want?

06:45.932 --> 06:48.332
Here we go, baby.
3 for 3. It's all mine.

06:48.368 --> 06:50.029
Here we go. Here we go.

06:50.069 --> 06:51.229
Big prize. Watch out.
Come on.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.776
# That's what I'm talkin' 'bout #

06:58.811 --> 07:00.540
We gonna get that one.
You want that blue one?

07:00.580 --> 07:01.604
That's the one we gonna get.

07:14.061 --> 07:19.499
You can run, but you cannot hide.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.501
- Yes!
- Whoo! Here we are, baby.

07:21.535 --> 07:22.559
Yes!

07:22.603 --> 07:24.628
- There it is.
- Awesome.

07:24.671 --> 07:26.536
Here, get a pic of this.

07:26.573 --> 07:29.337
This is the beginning of the end.

07:32.446 --> 07:34.641
Hey, guys, get in line.

07:39.286 --> 07:41.482
Let's go on again!

07:41.523 --> 07:42.547
What's wrong?

07:44.159 --> 07:46.024
I'm...

07:46.061 --> 07:48.222
I was having that feeling
like deja vu, you know?

07:48.263 --> 07:51.562
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

07:51.599 --> 07:52.657
Hey, J.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.928
Come on, man, let's go.

07:53.968 --> 07:55.959
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

07:56.004 --> 07:57.471
What, are you weirded out
by the ride?

07:59.274 --> 08:02.334
'Cause, look, I know you.
And I think that maybe...

08:02.377 --> 08:03.935
you're nervous about
this roller coaster...

08:03.978 --> 08:06.606
because they say the real fear
with these rides...

08:06.648 --> 08:09.947
comes from the feeling
of having no control.

08:09.984 --> 08:13.113
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

08:13.155 --> 08:15.817
But it never turns out
to be what they imagine.

08:15.858 --> 08:17.348
Never.

08:18.627 --> 08:19.787
OK.

08:19.829 --> 08:23.560
You can run, but you cannot hide.

08:23.599 --> 08:26.295
Oh! Where you guys are right now
if you raise your hands and just...

08:26.335 --> 08:28.303
Ha... cup them slightly...

08:28.337 --> 08:30.737
it'll look you're holding
the devil's balls.

08:30.773 --> 08:32.604
And we'd wanna do that why?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.972
When else you ever gonna see
a dick that big?

08:35.010 --> 08:36.272
I'm lookin' at one right now.

08:36.511 --> 08:40.840
Man, you guys are smokin' hot.

08:40.883 --> 08:43.148
- Get out, Frankie.
- Yeah, why are you even here?

08:43.186 --> 08:44.983
Yeah, you graduated,
like, two years ago.

08:45.021 --> 08:47.387
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

08:47.424 --> 08:49.289
Yeah. Good to go.
Good to go, baby.

08:49.326 --> 08:51.317
Let's do it. Let's do it.
Come on. Come on.

08:51.361 --> 08:55.559
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.960
You're totally sad.

09:00.704 --> 09:04.640
Try not to scream!

09:11.148 --> 09:13.048
That was totally awesome!

09:13.083 --> 09:14.415
Yeah! Sweet!

09:38.976 --> 09:40.341
You all right?

09:40.378 --> 09:42.676
There's nothing to worry about.

09:42.713 --> 09:44.909
A roller coaster
is just elemental physics.

09:44.950 --> 09:47.976
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.147
Yeah. Odds are like
one in 250 million...

09:50.189 --> 09:51.520
of dying in a roller coaster.

09:51.557 --> 09:53.889
Yeah, yeah,
thanks for that, McKinley.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.224
You're more likely to die
driving to an amusement park...

09:56.261 --> 09:58.252
than dying at one.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.006
Here we go.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.375
You like this?

10:18.418 --> 10:21.012
Won it on the Wacky Ladder.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.649
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.421
I like this. It's old school.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.486
Frankie Cheeks
is old school, ladies.

10:30.530 --> 10:34.330
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.301
Oh! Let's go.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.964
Hey... Baby.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.939
- How many?
- Uh, 4.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.305
- 4.
- Yeah.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.673
Uh, gate one.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.972
- Yeah. Front car.
- Yes!

10:45.011 --> 10:46.137
Wait... No. No, please.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.580
I'm sorry, I don't wanna be a hassle.
I just... I can't sit in the front.

10:48.616 --> 10:50.777
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.343
OK. Take it easy.

10:53.387 --> 10:56.447
Uh, well, Carrie will sit in
the back with you. Right, babe?

10:56.490 --> 10:59.482
Uh! Why me?
What? 'Cause we're girls?

10:59.526 --> 11:02.552
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

11:02.596 --> 11:03.790
I'm sitting in the front.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.288
J, just go, OK? I'll live.

11:06.333 --> 11:06.628
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

11:06.633 --> 11:07.759
You're not gonna sit by yourself.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.768
All right, you know what?
We'll just settle this like real men.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.463
How about that? Hmm? Call it.

11:11.670 --> 11:12.534
Heads.

11:13.538 --> 11:16.132
Shit! Damn it.

11:17.142 --> 11:19.577
All right, fine, what the fuck.
It's the same ride, right?

11:19.612 --> 11:21.409
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.972
Hey, uh, just do me a favor.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.814
Keep an eye on her, OK?
She's kinda freaked out.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.978
- Oh. Cool.
- All right?

11:27.020 --> 11:28.954
Yeah. Boom, buddy.
No problem.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.047
Here we go. Hey!

12:05.092 --> 12:07.253
J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.592
I'm serious. You know,
payback's a bitch, OK?

12:09.630 --> 12:11.427
You know, she might need
some comforting...

12:11.465 --> 12:13.057
and I'll be there for her. OK?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.364
Hey, no! No.
Get out. Get out.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.801
Hey! Find another cockpit,
Top Gun.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.532
No. Get...

12:18.572 --> 12:20.598
Let's just get in the back, OK?

12:27.615 --> 12:29.981
Guess who's back?

12:34.055 --> 12:36.023
I'll meet you at the end.

12:37.926 --> 12:39.393
Here! All right!

12:39.427 --> 12:40.587
Cool!

12:41.796 --> 12:44.094
Hey. How'd you guys
get in here?

12:44.132 --> 12:45.861
What? I'm 55 inches.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.367
- Sure. Come on out.
- Oh, man.

12:47.402 --> 12:48.699
You, too. Out.

12:48.737 --> 12:49.931
Ready?

12:49.971 --> 12:52.372
I told you
we wouldn't get away with it.

12:52.408 --> 12:53.432
You OK?

12:53.476 --> 12:55.000
Let's go on the bumper cars.

12:55.044 --> 12:56.978
Come on. Here we go.

13:00.349 --> 13:01.611
Yeah!

13:06.455 --> 13:07.513
What's up, man? I'm good.

13:11.227 --> 13:13.855
Dare you to, uh, flash me
them sweet, sweet titties...

13:13.896 --> 13:15.124
when we go through the loop.

13:20.402 --> 13:22.428
All right.

13:27.210 --> 13:29.906
Yo! What, you can't read?

13:32.682 --> 13:35.150
Oh. Well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man?

13:35.185 --> 13:36.209
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

13:36.253 --> 13:38.244
Yeah? Cool.
Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

13:48.498 --> 13:50.329
Aw, shit!

13:53.805 --> 13:54.897
Here you go!

14:05.616 --> 14:09.143
Whoo! Win, baby!
Yes, baby! Win!

14:09.187 --> 14:10.984
Come on!

14:11.022 --> 14:12.819
Come on. Get hyped.

14:12.857 --> 14:14.154
The first hill's so high.

14:14.192 --> 14:15.625
Yeah.

14:15.660 --> 14:18.527
This is what we need!

14:18.563 --> 14:21.396
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:25.204 --> 14:27.297
- Let's do this!
- Just win!

14:33.578 --> 14:35.239
Aw, yeah!

15:06.045 --> 15:07.740
Whoo! Shit!

15:17.056 --> 15:18.853
Oh, man.

15:18.891 --> 15:20.825
Oh, my God!

15:20.860 --> 15:21.849
Here we go!

15:21.894 --> 15:23.589
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:17.485 --> 16:20.249
Yeah! Show me your titties!

16:20.288 --> 16:21.414
Fuck off, Frankie!

16:44.847 --> 16:46.280
Oh, shit!

16:50.386 --> 16:53.753
Oh, my God!
We're gonna fall off!

16:58.595 --> 17:00.028
No!

17:37.067 --> 17:38.534
- Yow!
- Kevin!

17:39.537 --> 17:40.697
No!

17:54.151 --> 17:56.483
No!

18:09.100 --> 18:10.931
Erin, hang on!

18:10.969 --> 18:13.335
Erin!

18:13.371 --> 18:14.861
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

18:14.906 --> 18:15.873
I can't.

18:19.711 --> 18:21.201
No!

18:23.415 --> 18:25.178
Oh, God!

18:25.217 --> 18:26.775
Hang on, Wen.

18:26.818 --> 18:29.719
Hang on! Help me rock it!

18:41.133 --> 18:43.624
Almost got it! Gently.

18:58.518 --> 18:59.951
No!

19:08.262 --> 19:09.957
Yo. What, you can't read?

19:09.997 --> 19:11.658
Oh, well. I'll just...
I'll put it in my pocket, OK?

19:11.699 --> 19:12.791
Yeah.

19:12.833 --> 19:14.357
Thanks, bro.

19:14.402 --> 19:15.733
Ahh. All right.
Let's do this, Wen...

19:15.770 --> 19:17.635
What're you...?

19:17.672 --> 19:19.264
Here you go!

19:19.306 --> 19:21.536
Yeah! Let's do it, baby!

19:21.575 --> 19:23.600
We have to get off of here.

19:23.644 --> 19:26.112
No, don't push the button!
Don't! Don't push the button!

19:26.347 --> 19:28.809
Let me off! Let me off!

19:28.849 --> 19:30.180
Wen, Wen! It's all right.
Jesus, it's gonna be over...

19:30.217 --> 19:31.946
No! It's gonna crash!
It's gonna crash!

19:31.986 --> 19:32.975
Wendy?

19:33.020 --> 19:36.616
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks'll collapse! Please!

19:36.658 --> 19:38.125
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

19:38.160 --> 19:39.457
Chick's on somethin'.

19:39.494 --> 19:40.552
It's all right! You'll be OK!

19:40.595 --> 19:41.619
OK, let 'em out. Just the back.

19:41.663 --> 19:42.925
Wen. Hey! Wendy!

19:46.201 --> 19:48.396
Relax. Now, what's the matter?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.837
I saw it. I saw it in my head.

19:50.872 --> 19:53.238
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.038
No, she was just a little upset before.

19:55.077 --> 19:57.102
Man, please, can you please
control that bitch?

19:57.145 --> 20:00.478
Damn. "It's gonna crash!
The hydraulics, the coaster!"

20:00.515 --> 20:02.506
Man, she's just trying to get
some fuckin' attention.

20:02.551 --> 20:04.281
You know what?
You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.787
- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?

20:05.822 --> 20:07.187
No, man, fuck you!
Don't touch me.

20:10.493 --> 20:11.460
Just relax!

20:11.494 --> 20:12.791
Fight, man!

20:12.829 --> 20:13.887
Hey. Hey. Let me out.

20:13.930 --> 20:15.522
Nobody else gets off this ride!

20:15.565 --> 20:17.499
Dude, let me off.

20:17.533 --> 20:18.830
So high school.

20:18.868 --> 20:19.994
Let's out.

20:20.036 --> 20:21.060
- Calm down!
- Get off of him!

20:21.104 --> 20:22.128
- Relax!
- Lan!

20:22.171 --> 20:25.004
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

20:25.041 --> 20:28.636
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

20:28.678 --> 20:30.976
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's OK.

20:31.013 --> 20:33.243
- Relax! Calm down!
- # Hey! Ho! Let's go #

20:33.282 --> 20:34.909
- Get your big ass off me, man!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

20:34.951 --> 20:37.352
- Let me out!
- # Hey, ho, let's go! #

20:37.387 --> 20:38.649
Dude!

20:38.689 --> 20:41.556
# Hey, ho, let's go,
hey, ho, let's go #

20:41.592 --> 20:43.321
- Here we go!
- Let me off!

20:43.360 --> 20:44.725
# Hey, ho #

20:47.397 --> 20:48.796
Dude, that's my girlfriend!

20:48.832 --> 20:49.821
Oh, my God!

20:51.301 --> 20:53.269
Stop it! No! Stop it!

20:54.404 --> 20:57.271
Stop it! Please!
Please, the tracks are broken.

20:57.307 --> 21:00.276
Stop! Stop! Please!

21:00.310 --> 21:01.834
Jason!

21:01.879 --> 21:03.813
Hey, just relax, OK?

21:03.847 --> 21:06.180
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right.

21:06.217 --> 21:07.343
OK? Just let her settle down.

21:07.385 --> 21:08.852
She can settle down at home!
Now listen...

21:08.887 --> 21:10.479
what is your home phone number?

21:10.522 --> 21:13.491
OK, we're gonna call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of...

21:16.828 --> 21:21.731
Oh, my God! Jason!

22:56.196 --> 22:57.925
Hey, Wendy!

22:57.964 --> 22:59.693
Hey!

22:59.733 --> 23:02.429
Wait! Wendy!

23:02.469 --> 23:04.061
Hey! Hey, Wen. Wait.

23:04.104 --> 23:05.799
I need... I need to talk to you
about something.

23:05.839 --> 23:07.636
Just here to pick up my diploma.

23:07.674 --> 23:08.936
You're not going to graduation?

23:08.975 --> 23:10.273
No.

23:10.311 --> 23:14.042
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked up place, OK?

23:14.081 --> 23:16.743
God, I mean,
I just thought maybe...

23:16.784 --> 23:18.809
it'd be good for you to be somewhere
where other people feel the same way.

23:18.853 --> 23:19.842
At graduation?

23:19.887 --> 23:21.616
No. Thanks.
I've had enough funerals.

23:21.655 --> 23:23.054
Then do it for J and Carrie.

23:23.090 --> 23:24.921
Do what? If you die,
then there's nothing...

23:24.959 --> 23:27.291
then you're just dead,
and they don't know.

23:27.328 --> 23:28.590
And if they are up in Heaven
with Lincoln and Gandhi...

23:28.629 --> 23:31.097
do you think they really care about
our high school graduation? No.

23:31.132 --> 23:33.600
I am alive, and I don't care.

23:33.634 --> 23:34.931
As soon as I pull out
of that parking lot...

23:34.969 --> 23:37.267
I am so out of McKinley.

23:37.304 --> 23:38.669
Without J, what's here for me?

23:38.706 --> 23:40.697
I'm here. OK?

23:40.741 --> 23:44.178
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

23:44.212 --> 23:47.045
On the ride. For 3 minutes.

23:47.082 --> 23:49.107
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

23:49.151 --> 23:51.176
Kevin...

23:51.219 --> 23:52.846
if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

23:52.888 --> 23:54.583
and me and Carrie being friends...

23:54.623 --> 23:57.285
we wouldn't have even hung out.

23:59.461 --> 24:02.157
We don't even like each other.

24:10.839 --> 24:13.240
"Lan McKinley."

24:13.276 --> 24:15.710
How pathetic is it
that my last name...

24:15.745 --> 24:17.440
is the same as my high school?

24:17.480 --> 24:20.313
Julie, look who
I got to sign my yearbook.

24:20.349 --> 24:23.045
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah.

24:30.993 --> 24:32.961
I think we should invite her.

24:32.995 --> 24:34.485
- You think?
- Yeah.

24:38.601 --> 24:40.466
Wen? Um...

24:40.503 --> 24:43.064
So we're ready
for graduation tonight...

24:43.107 --> 24:45.507
we're going to
the tanning salon after this...

24:45.542 --> 24:47.976
and we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

24:48.011 --> 24:49.137
Totally.

24:49.179 --> 24:51.238
And just like, talk if you want.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.815
Here's my cell.

24:54.852 --> 24:57.116
I already have your number.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.382
That was so nice of us.

25:11.268 --> 25:12.735
You're not alone.

25:12.769 --> 25:14.601
God, I appreciate
everyone trying to help.

25:14.639 --> 25:15.867
OK? I really do.

25:15.907 --> 25:17.636
No, it's happened before.

25:17.675 --> 25:20.701
OK? I went online looking for
an explanation about...

25:20.745 --> 25:23.009
Wendy, just... just listen
to me, all right?

25:23.047 --> 25:26.073
All right, look, I went online
looking for an explanation...

25:26.117 --> 25:27.550
about what happened,
and I found out...

25:27.585 --> 25:30.110
about this high school
French class from New York.

25:30.155 --> 25:33.147
Six years ago
they went on a trip to Paris.

25:33.191 --> 25:34.488
When they were boarding...

25:34.526 --> 25:36.960
a kid had a vision that
the plane was gonna explode.

25:36.995 --> 25:40.055
Just like you did.

25:40.098 --> 25:41.656
He freaked out...

25:41.699 --> 25:44.099
and seven people
got off the plane.

25:46.605 --> 25:48.004
Just like us.

25:50.042 --> 25:53.739
And on takeoff,
Flight 180 blew up.

25:53.779 --> 25:56.111
And over the next several months...

25:56.148 --> 26:00.312
everyone who got off that plane
started dying in weird accidents.

26:00.352 --> 26:03.810
They died in the order they would've
if they had stayed on the plane.

26:03.856 --> 26:07.257
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

26:07.293 --> 26:09.853
Fuck you, Kevin.

26:09.895 --> 26:12.796
W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!

26:36.756 --> 26:39.623
Ohh, every time we come here.

26:39.659 --> 26:42.890
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

26:42.929 --> 26:45.659
We did that for all the funerals
and it turned out amazing.

26:45.699 --> 26:47.133
Yeah, but that was just
a couple of weeks ago, though.

26:47.168 --> 26:48.726
I mean, we're still pretty bronzed.

26:48.769 --> 26:50.634
I was just thinking
we could go for, like, a tune-up.

26:50.671 --> 26:53.071
I just wanna make sure
that we look our best.

26:53.107 --> 26:54.369
Yeah.

26:54.408 --> 26:56.433
You know, for all those kids
that died that night...

26:56.477 --> 26:58.411
who will never get a graduation.

27:00.214 --> 27:01.704
You know what?
You're totally right.

27:01.749 --> 27:04.047
I'm sorry.

27:27.409 --> 27:29.969
This is my... my good guy
luck bracelet...

27:30.012 --> 27:32.242
that Grandma left me in her will.

27:34.616 --> 27:36.675
Julie?

27:38.520 --> 27:40.385
I need...

27:43.625 --> 27:45.456
I could use some help.

27:47.062 --> 27:51.193
I have such...
such guilt over Jason.

27:51.234 --> 27:54.260
I should never have let
that ride go.

27:54.304 --> 27:57.796
God. I'm usually such
a control freak...

27:57.840 --> 27:59.307
but I didn't do
enough to stop it.

27:59.342 --> 28:02.834
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

28:03.846 --> 28:06.644
And I would give anything...

28:06.683 --> 28:08.810
to have a second chance.

28:11.621 --> 28:13.282
But I never can.

28:17.927 --> 28:20.692
I don't want to some day
feel that way about you, Julie.

28:20.731 --> 28:24.030
I mean,
I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

28:26.070 --> 28:27.970
You're all I have left.

28:30.074 --> 28:31.473
You think when I find a place...

28:31.508 --> 28:33.738
maybe you could come stay
with me for a while?

28:35.913 --> 28:38.040
You know I will.

28:40.084 --> 28:41.745
You...

28:43.787 --> 28:45.277
keep this now...

28:45.322 --> 28:47.813
and I'll get it
when I come see you.

28:49.493 --> 28:52.827
Oh. And... hey,
how 'bout on your end?

28:52.864 --> 28:56.027
Can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.900
Yeah. As long as you bring it back
to school on Monday.

28:58.937 --> 29:00.427
Done.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.073
Actually, the battery is pretty low...

29:04.109 --> 29:07.408
so why don't you go get ready,
and I'll recharge it a bit.

29:07.445 --> 29:09.003
Cool.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.388
In a hurry, Yuri.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.422
Sorry, sorry.
Cell phone signal is shit in here.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.434
I think tanning beds
mess with signal.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.935
I must go outside.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.734
Why don't you just use that phone?

29:33.773 --> 29:36.742
I would, but she talks forever,
then my boss gives me shit.

29:38.511 --> 29:39.910
Shit. That's her.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.006
You know what? Just go outside.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.379
We can deal with this ourselves.

29:44.417 --> 29:45.941
OK.

29:47.853 --> 29:51.949
Hey. No drinks in the room
this time, OK?

29:51.991 --> 29:53.016
Good.

30:05.105 --> 30:06.231
What are you doing?

30:06.273 --> 30:08.764
Nobody is walking in here
and seein' me naked.

31:46.276 --> 31:48.301
Oh, my God.

31:58.522 --> 32:00.922
Dude, he said no drinks.
If you spill that shit...

32:00.958 --> 32:02.755
we're gonna have to clean it
up like last time.

32:04.962 --> 32:07.487
Happy, beyotch?
Nothing to spill.

32:09.466 --> 32:11.696
Why does Yuri keep it
so cold in here?

32:12.102 --> 32:14.593
Maybe it's supposed to be colder
for the machines or whatever.

32:14.637 --> 32:16.696
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

32:42.032 --> 32:44.023
Shit! I forgot my iPod.

32:44.068 --> 32:46.059
Sucks, bitch.

32:46.103 --> 32:48.264
They got CDs.

32:51.675 --> 32:53.700
Ew. Celine?

32:53.744 --> 32:55.143
Britney?

32:55.179 --> 32:57.374
Dude, are we like the only cool people
that come here or what?

32:57.414 --> 33:00.316
Uh, yeah.

33:00.352 --> 33:03.082
Ugh. Whatever.

33:17.269 --> 33:20.432
Why are you wearing underwear?

33:20.472 --> 33:22.702
Steinmetz says
he gets off on tan lines.

33:22.741 --> 33:25.232
All right.

34:09.156 --> 34:10.679
# Roller coaster #

34:10.724 --> 34:12.021
# Of love #

34:12.059 --> 34:13.389
# Say what? #

34:13.427 --> 34:15.554
# Roller coaster #

34:17.598 --> 34:18.792
# Roller coaster #

34:18.831 --> 34:19.821
# Right #

34:19.867 --> 34:21.458
# Of love #

34:21.702 --> 34:24.034
# Roller coaster #

34:26.206 --> 34:30.005
# Roller coaster of love #

34:30.043 --> 34:31.739
# Roller coaster #

34:34.482 --> 34:37.918
# Roller coaster of love... #

34:59.173 --> 35:01.141
# I #

35:06.982 --> 35:08.813
# I'm gonna ride, girl #

35:25.467 --> 35:28.493
# Roller coaster of love #

35:28.537 --> 35:29.765
# Love roller coaster, girl #

35:29.805 --> 35:31.568
# Roller coaster #

35:31.607 --> 35:34.475
# Lovin' you
in a freaky world, child #

35:34.511 --> 35:37.480
# Roller coaster of love #

35:44.788 --> 35:47.154
Camera charged?

35:47.190 --> 35:50.091
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

35:50.126 --> 35:51.957
Camera's not working. Sorry.

35:55.231 --> 35:58.428
Look, Julie, I need a minute, OK?

35:58.468 --> 36:00.459
Like private.

36:05.076 --> 36:07.977
# That feels nice,
roller coaster #

36:08.012 --> 36:10.276
# One more time #

36:10.314 --> 36:13.750
# Roller coaster of love #

36:14.819 --> 36:16.582
# Roller coaster #

36:17.655 --> 36:22.183
# Roller coaster of love #

36:26.897 --> 36:29.365
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

36:34.605 --> 36:37.575
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

36:56.795 --> 36:57.921
Hello?

36:57.963 --> 37:00.955
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...
- Psych! Leave a message.

37:02.401 --> 37:03.698
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

37:03.735 --> 37:04.759
Gimme a call whenever
you guys are done.

37:05.804 --> 37:07.670
And thanks again for the invite.

37:07.707 --> 37:09.766
Someone help!

37:11.744 --> 37:13.712
Sorry I was too late.

37:44.611 --> 37:45.737
Hey, open the door!

37:54.455 --> 37:56.719
Help me!

38:12.841 --> 38:17.210
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

38:17.245 --> 38:21.238
That Death controls,
frames our lives.

38:21.282 --> 38:24.649
Our birth's nothing
but death begun.

38:24.686 --> 38:29.282
Yet, whether it is with
this tragic loss of young lives...

38:29.324 --> 38:32.725
which we have
suffered much of late...

38:32.760 --> 38:37.663
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

38:37.699 --> 38:42.330
we are all equal in Death's eyes.

38:42.371 --> 38:45.067
"Equal in Death's eyes?"

38:45.074 --> 38:47.065
All of us?
How can you say that?

38:47.109 --> 38:48.337
Shut up, McKinley.

38:48.377 --> 38:51.039
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.105
- Osama? Still kickin'.
- Let's go.

38:53.148 --> 38:55.844
Pimps, vice-presidents
walking around.

38:55.884 --> 38:58.580
- All the atrocities they've committed...
- Let's just go. Come on.

38:58.620 --> 38:59.882
They're alive and well.

38:59.922 --> 39:03.983
These two girls, who'd never
done shit to anybody...

39:04.026 --> 39:06.221
- Shh!
- They don't get to make it to 18?

39:06.261 --> 39:07.888
Where's the fucking
equality in that?

39:09.231 --> 39:10.199
- What?
- Come on, man.

39:10.233 --> 39:11.894
I can... Yeah. Fine.

39:11.935 --> 39:13.562
Fine. All right. All right.

39:13.603 --> 39:15.366
I'm fine. All right.

39:15.405 --> 39:17.168
That's crazy.

39:18.641 --> 39:21.940
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

39:21.978 --> 39:25.141
please step forward at this time.

39:31.788 --> 39:34.848
I so feel this is so my fault.

39:34.891 --> 39:37.359
How could it possibly be your fault?

39:37.393 --> 39:40.487
Seein' women as nothin' but fun bags.

39:40.530 --> 39:44.524
I mean... if I'd've seen their...

39:44.568 --> 39:47.366
whatever... humanity...

39:47.404 --> 39:50.464
they wouldn't have felt
the pressure to look so good.

39:50.508 --> 39:54.911
Impress Franklin Cheeks.
Go on diets. Deodorize.

39:54.945 --> 39:58.312
Stretch. Tan.

39:59.350 --> 40:00.942
Don't be down, Frankie.

40:00.985 --> 40:02.748
Be proud of your ability
to make everything...

40:02.786 --> 40:05.050
that happens somehow
a story about you.

40:09.860 --> 40:11.191
God!

40:21.406 --> 40:24.000
Yo, man.
These things really suck, man.

40:24.042 --> 40:26.272
Fucking boring.

40:26.311 --> 40:29.144
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

40:29.181 --> 40:30.910
man, bring me a PSP or somethin'.

40:30.949 --> 40:32.610
'Least I have somethin' to do then.

40:36.454 --> 40:39.423
Whew.

40:40.959 --> 40:42.153
Hello?

40:42.194 --> 40:43.753
I'm with J.

41:10.189 --> 41:13.056
What are you doing up here
in the nosebleeds?

41:14.561 --> 41:16.495
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

41:16.530 --> 41:19.761
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.964
And I wondered if
maybe here I could feel J's...

41:25.472 --> 41:27.940
spirit or presence or...

41:27.975 --> 41:29.966
whatever.

41:30.010 --> 41:32.808
But now that I'm here...

41:32.846 --> 41:36.441
if there's any place that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

41:38.118 --> 41:40.086
it's a cemetery.

41:41.989 --> 41:44.959
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

41:45.994 --> 41:47.723
And I've tried.

41:48.763 --> 41:50.697
Real hard.

41:53.434 --> 41:56.494
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

41:58.506 --> 42:02.636
that night...
before I got on the ride...

42:02.677 --> 42:04.577
Jason said...

42:04.612 --> 42:06.204
God, and it was just
to get me on the ride...

42:06.247 --> 42:08.044
he said...

42:08.082 --> 42:12.644
"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."

42:12.687 --> 42:15.383
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

42:15.423 --> 42:19.360
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination...

42:19.395 --> 42:23.991
but this fear is more
than just being scared.

42:24.033 --> 42:26.593
It's like a presence.

42:26.635 --> 42:30.537
Like a living thing
always with me.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.698
You think it's J?

42:33.742 --> 42:35.266
No, I know it's not.

42:35.311 --> 42:40.180
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

42:40.215 --> 42:44.515
It's cold and terrifying.

43:20.257 --> 43:22.817
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

43:22.860 --> 43:24.350
The photographic plate
was broken...

43:24.395 --> 43:26.761
causing a line
that can't be removed.

43:26.797 --> 43:28.628
Exactly where he was shot.

43:30.801 --> 43:32.666
Look. See the shadow?

43:34.271 --> 43:36.899
But what do these pictures
have to do with us?

43:36.941 --> 43:40.308
Look. This occurred
one year to the day...

43:40.344 --> 43:42.403
of the Flight 180 disaster.
Look at the road sign.

43:42.446 --> 43:44.471
Look, I guess you came
to me with this...

43:44.515 --> 43:46.813
because I'm responsible
for putting this in your head...

43:46.851 --> 43:48.079
with the Flight 180 thing.

43:48.119 --> 43:50.145
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here...

43:50.188 --> 43:51.951
but you can't believe
every weird thing out there...

43:51.990 --> 43:53.116
because you're desperate
for an answer.

43:53.158 --> 43:55.058
I took these.

43:55.093 --> 43:57.061
That night.

44:03.969 --> 44:05.800
These?

44:09.508 --> 44:10.634
Are these it?

44:15.647 --> 44:18.172
Oh, shit.

44:19.752 --> 44:21.652
Oh... shit.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.886
You all right?

44:28.928 --> 44:30.555
I'm feeling a little woozy.

44:32.231 --> 44:34.165
When was the last time you ate?

44:35.401 --> 44:36.993
I don't remember.

44:38.171 --> 44:39.866
All right, come on. I'll drive.

44:44.643 --> 44:48.340
OK, those kids on Flight 180
died in accidents...

44:48.380 --> 44:50.713
in the order they would've died
if they'd have stayed on the plane.

44:50.750 --> 44:53.378
OK?
So if this is that, then...

44:54.588 --> 44:56.715
then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

44:57.991 --> 44:59.288
When I saw Ashley
and Ashlyn's picture...

44:59.326 --> 45:01.351
I felt this instinct.

45:01.394 --> 45:03.123
Like there was a hint
in the picture. I even...

45:03.163 --> 45:05.631
I even called to see if
I could keep them from going.

45:05.665 --> 45:06.893
Well, what's
Frankie's picture look like?

45:06.933 --> 45:07.957
It's right here.

45:08.001 --> 45:10.333
- You got it?
- Yeah.

45:13.340 --> 45:14.830
Wait! Watch out!

45:14.875 --> 45:16.934
Hey! Hey! Are you crazy?

45:16.977 --> 45:19.002
Sorry!

45:21.482 --> 45:23.313
All right,
let's just eat over there.

45:23.351 --> 45:24.579
And go through
the drive through.

45:24.619 --> 45:25.813
I don't want anyone hearing
what we're talking about.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.548
Well, it's nice to see
that things haven't made you...

45:27.588 --> 45:28.953
any less of a control freak.

45:37.431 --> 45:39.058
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

45:39.100 --> 45:40.124
Here's Frank's picture.

45:40.167 --> 45:41.691
All right.

45:41.736 --> 45:44.102
Well, this is obvious.
He's falling off a ladder.

45:44.138 --> 45:47.039
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

45:48.042 --> 45:50.738
Look, or maybe it's not that literal.
All right, what's...

45:50.778 --> 45:52.006
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

45:52.046 --> 45:54.743
Oh, what, like he's gonna get
crushed by a giant Spongebob?

45:55.817 --> 45:58.115
Hey, Spongebob lives underwater.

45:59.554 --> 46:02.079
It's so sad that you know that.

46:02.124 --> 46:04.149
All right. He won that tacky
mud-flap girl chain...

46:04.192 --> 46:05.750
on this game, though, so...

46:05.794 --> 46:07.762
aren't those usually
on those big 18 wheelers?

46:07.796 --> 46:09.058
Yeah. Yeah.

46:09.097 --> 46:10.962
God, I don't see it in
this picture anywhere though.

46:13.035 --> 46:15.230
All right! God.

46:18.373 --> 46:19.704
All right.

46:23.446 --> 46:24.606
Uh, can I take your order?

46:24.647 --> 46:26.478
Yeah. What do you want?

46:31.554 --> 46:32.987
Are you OK?

46:41.130 --> 46:43.758
Please tell me
there's a short in your wiring.

46:46.202 --> 46:49.137
Whoa. Whoa. That guy's
way too close to my truck.

46:49.172 --> 46:51.265
Hey, you're too fucking
close, man! Pull up!

46:51.307 --> 46:52.899
Hey!

46:57.081 --> 46:58.742
# There is someone #

46:58.782 --> 47:00.272
Stop! Stop!

47:00.317 --> 47:01.306
# Walking behind you #

47:02.319 --> 47:03.980
Watch out! Shit!

47:04.021 --> 47:05.147
- What the fuck?
- # Turn around #

47:05.189 --> 47:07.282
- Oh, my God!
- # Look at me #

47:07.324 --> 47:09.383
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

47:09.426 --> 47:11.087
Behind us!

47:11.128 --> 47:12.253
There's no one in that truck!

47:12.263 --> 47:12.520
# Watching your footsteps #

47:12.529 --> 47:13.527
# Watching your footsteps #

47:13.530 --> 47:16.624
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

47:17.767 --> 47:21.296
- # Look at me #
- Shit!

47:21.338 --> 47:22.305
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

47:22.339 --> 47:23.363
Back up!

47:24.407 --> 47:26.399
# Who really loves you #

47:27.912 --> 47:30.107
# Here's my heart #

47:30.147 --> 47:31.307
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

47:31.349 --> 47:33.544
# In my hand #

47:33.584 --> 47:37.315
# Turn around #

47:37.355 --> 47:38.686
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

47:38.723 --> 47:40.020
Come on, come on, come on.

48:34.347 --> 48:37.714
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

48:37.750 --> 48:40.218
Um, we can walk to my house...

48:40.253 --> 48:42.619
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

48:43.990 --> 48:45.252
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

48:50.263 --> 48:51.321
Will we?

48:53.766 --> 48:55.199
Yeah. We'll be all right.

48:55.234 --> 48:57.759
I mean...

48:57.804 --> 48:59.898
how Frank...

48:59.940 --> 49:01.737
God, it... it's not only horrible...

49:01.775 --> 49:05.006
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

49:05.045 --> 49:06.410
Easy.

49:06.447 --> 49:08.381
OK? Easy.

49:10.083 --> 49:11.675
Let's just...

49:11.718 --> 49:13.549
let's just take a step back.

49:14.955 --> 49:17.219
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

49:17.257 --> 49:19.350
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

49:19.393 --> 49:21.918
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

49:21.962 --> 49:23.725
We were wrong about the photos.

49:23.764 --> 49:26.631
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

49:26.667 --> 49:29.660
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

49:29.704 --> 49:31.763
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

49:32.774 --> 49:36.574
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

49:38.279 --> 49:40.474
No. L... you know, I'm not...

49:40.515 --> 49:42.881
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

49:44.385 --> 49:46.717
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

49:46.754 --> 49:48.813
then Ian and Erin.

49:48.856 --> 49:50.983
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

49:51.025 --> 49:53.084
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

49:53.127 --> 49:54.116
No.

49:54.162 --> 49:56.027
All right, you know what?

49:56.063 --> 49:58.497
We'll ask Lewis, Ian, and Erin
if they remember.

49:58.533 --> 50:00.091
OK?

50:00.134 --> 50:02.660
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

50:15.951 --> 50:18.681
I guess...

50:18.720 --> 50:20.278
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

50:20.322 --> 50:21.516
for the rest of our lives.

50:21.557 --> 50:23.149
Yeah.

50:24.626 --> 50:26.924
You know, I was gonna...

50:26.962 --> 50:29.123
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

50:30.699 --> 50:32.668
Right after graduation.

50:54.123 --> 50:56.091
No, wait.

50:56.125 --> 50:57.558
Look, behind Stacy.

50:58.561 --> 50:59.755
That's Frank.

51:00.897 --> 51:02.490
This picture shows how he died.

51:07.538 --> 51:07.902
All right, go back to Lewis.

51:07.905 --> 51:09.896
All right, go back to Lewis.

51:11.909 --> 51:13.342
OK, he's got that hammer.

51:13.377 --> 51:16.244
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

51:16.280 --> 51:18.077
on his head.

51:18.115 --> 51:19.104
No, no, no, check this out.

51:19.149 --> 51:22.243
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

51:22.286 --> 51:24.686
State's team is called the Sultans.

51:24.721 --> 51:26.348
That's it. That's the clue.

51:26.390 --> 51:29.359
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

51:33.631 --> 51:34.655
Wouldn't you want to know?

51:36.234 --> 51:37.599
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

51:37.635 --> 51:39.330
Yeah.

51:39.370 --> 51:40.632
Yeah, of course.

51:40.672 --> 51:42.663
Huh. No.

51:42.707 --> 51:45.471
No. I don't want to see mine.
No.

51:45.510 --> 51:46.807
What about willful ignorance?

51:46.844 --> 51:49.506
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

51:49.547 --> 51:51.242
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

51:51.282 --> 51:52.544
before it happened, Wendy.

51:53.718 --> 51:55.879
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

51:55.920 --> 51:58.889
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

51:58.923 --> 52:00.515
I gotta stay focused...

52:00.558 --> 52:02.116
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.721
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

52:06.832 --> 52:08.993
I mean, unless we have to.

52:10.002 --> 52:12.732
You mean until we have to.

52:18.710 --> 52:20.337
One more thing.

52:20.379 --> 52:22.347
Is it bad?

52:22.381 --> 52:25.646
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

52:25.918 --> 52:28.182
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

52:28.220 --> 52:29.812
I'll see you tomorrow.

52:34.726 --> 52:36.354
You on crack. Both of you.

52:36.396 --> 52:38.728
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

52:38.765 --> 52:40.392
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

52:40.433 --> 52:41.957
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

52:42.001 --> 52:43.491
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

52:43.536 --> 52:45.663
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

52:45.705 --> 52:47.969
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

52:48.007 --> 52:50.305
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

52:50.343 --> 52:51.401
Just listen, Lewis.

52:51.444 --> 52:53.810
Kevin, it's like those stories.

52:53.846 --> 52:57.680
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

52:57.717 --> 53:01.016
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

53:01.054 --> 53:03.181
You know, shit like that, man.

53:03.222 --> 53:04.689
Fuck the Bruins!

53:04.724 --> 53:06.955
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

53:06.994 --> 53:08.757
Bruin faggots!

53:08.796 --> 53:10.388
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

53:13.400 --> 53:16.733
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

53:16.770 --> 53:18.738
Three people have died, Lewis.

53:18.772 --> 53:20.103
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

53:20.140 --> 53:22.108
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

53:22.142 --> 53:23.973
you're in serious denial.

53:24.011 --> 53:25.501
Unh! What about you two, huh?

53:25.546 --> 53:26.808
What?

53:26.847 --> 53:29.975
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

53:30.017 --> 53:31.951
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

53:31.986 --> 53:33.715
seeing signs and patterns, man.

53:33.754 --> 53:37.521
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

53:37.559 --> 53:40.050
Unh! It's wrong.

53:41.529 --> 53:43.292
That's denial.

53:46.167 --> 53:48.533
- Unh!
- You got it!

53:48.570 --> 53:50.834
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

53:50.872 --> 53:51.861
Wendy saw it.

53:51.906 --> 53:54.773
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

53:54.809 --> 53:57.243
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

53:57.278 --> 53:59.269
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

53:59.314 --> 54:00.906
Hers came to her from nowhere.

54:00.949 --> 54:02.678
You're here and alive because of her.

54:02.717 --> 54:04.207
No, I'm alive because of me.

54:04.252 --> 54:05.776
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

54:05.820 --> 54:07.185
Does that make sense to you?

54:07.222 --> 54:09.020
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

54:09.058 --> 54:10.821
No, just hear me out, all right?

54:11.927 --> 54:13.292
# Yeah #

54:18.501 --> 54:21.527
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

54:21.570 --> 54:23.970
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now.

54:24.006 --> 54:25.234
It's going just as I saw it.

54:25.274 --> 54:28.505
35 high school games
without an injury.

54:28.544 --> 54:30.876
- USA Today All-American.
- Second team.

54:30.913 --> 54:32.881
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

54:32.915 --> 54:34.439
Man, fuck the Bruins!

54:34.483 --> 54:35.973
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

54:36.018 --> 54:38.077
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

54:42.125 --> 54:43.717
Four years from now...

54:43.760 --> 54:46.285
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

54:48.031 --> 54:50.158
He's gonna romp and stomp.

54:50.200 --> 54:54.193
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

54:54.237 --> 54:56.364
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

54:56.406 --> 54:58.806
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

54:58.842 --> 55:00.537
Death wear blue and orange.

55:00.577 --> 55:03.375
Real men wear black.

55:03.413 --> 55:04.573
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

55:04.614 --> 55:06.912
Death is afraid of me!

55:06.950 --> 55:08.417
Death fears me!

55:08.452 --> 55:09.680
Kevin.

55:09.719 --> 55:11.813
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

55:11.856 --> 55:15.758
That's all I know how to do!
I just win!

55:15.793 --> 55:17.090
Fuck Death!

55:17.128 --> 55:19.062
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

55:21.032 --> 55:22.465
- Look out!
- Lewis!

55:24.602 --> 55:26.069
Man, that was close, Lewis.

55:26.104 --> 55:28.095
Hey, did you see that?

55:28.139 --> 55:31.597
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

55:31.642 --> 55:33.576
Fuck Death! I just win!

55:33.611 --> 55:35.010
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

55:35.046 --> 55:36.138
Baby, I just win!

55:38.716 --> 55:40.714
God!

55:50.462 --> 55:52.930
Did I do something...

55:55.099 --> 55:56.794
to bring this on everybody?

55:56.834 --> 55:58.927
Don't, Wendy.

55:58.970 --> 56:01.962
But why me?

56:02.006 --> 56:04.270
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

56:04.308 --> 56:07.141
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

56:10.247 --> 56:13.012
I just want it to stop.

56:13.051 --> 56:14.882
Just stop.

56:14.920 --> 56:17.616
I don't know why, Wendy...

56:17.656 --> 56:20.216
but you didn't do anything.

56:21.360 --> 56:23.885
All right? This is just...

56:23.929 --> 56:25.829
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

56:25.864 --> 56:28.594
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

56:28.633 --> 56:30.828
to make you feel OK, but...

56:33.305 --> 56:35.705
You know, I can't.

56:38.010 --> 56:39.409
Yeah.

56:40.412 --> 56:42.073
There's nothing I can do.

56:46.452 --> 56:47.885
Can you drive?

56:50.523 --> 56:51.785
Yeah.

56:56.596 --> 56:58.188
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

56:58.231 --> 57:02.531
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

57:02.568 --> 57:04.934
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

57:04.971 --> 57:06.802
Impaled by a gear shift?

57:10.143 --> 57:11.303
Right?

57:25.059 --> 57:26.754
Zip, it's Pip.

57:26.794 --> 57:28.227
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

57:28.262 --> 57:29.752
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

57:29.797 --> 57:33.164
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

57:33.200 --> 57:34.792
They keep settin' off the alarms.

57:47.915 --> 57:49.940
Hello, babies.

58:08.400 --> 58:11.699
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

58:11.737 --> 58:13.728
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

58:13.772 --> 58:15.673
to return to the shelves
themselves...

58:15.708 --> 58:17.107
we can blow out of here, OK?

58:17.143 --> 58:18.770
Righty-o, babe.

58:24.284 --> 58:26.013
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

58:26.052 --> 58:27.644
Shit!

58:27.687 --> 58:29.587
You scared the shit out of me!

58:29.622 --> 58:31.817
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

58:40.400 --> 58:43.335
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

58:43.369 --> 58:46.099
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

58:46.139 --> 58:49.337
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

58:49.376 --> 58:52.812
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. On nail polish...

58:52.847 --> 58:55.816
and Ian is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

58:55.850 --> 58:57.477
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

58:57.518 --> 59:00.419
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

59:10.998 --> 59:13.432
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

59:13.467 --> 59:16.732
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

59:19.708 --> 59:22.404
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

59:22.444 --> 59:25.811
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

59:25.847 --> 59:28.816
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

59:28.850 --> 59:31.683
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

59:31.720 --> 59:32.914
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

59:32.954 --> 59:34.717
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

59:34.756 --> 59:36.280
I didn't see his face, but, um...

59:36.324 --> 59:38.519
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

59:38.560 --> 59:41.927
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

59:41.963 --> 59:43.828
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

59:43.865 --> 59:45.355
This is our lives, OK?

59:45.400 --> 59:47.664
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

59:47.702 --> 59:49.500
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

59:49.538 --> 59:52.439
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

59:52.475 --> 59:55.103
No. It's like... like a force.

59:55.144 --> 59:58.841
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

59:58.881 --> 01:00:01.349
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

01:00:01.384 --> 01:00:04.842
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

01:00:04.887 --> 01:00:06.548
But there is awareness, McKinley.

01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:09.023
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

01:00:09.058 --> 01:00:11.322
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.123
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:22.171
- Top shelf.
- OK.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.910
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:36.075
Lan, watch those boxes!

01:00:41.224 --> 01:00:44.057
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

01:00:44.094 --> 01:00:45.857
No, I said watch the boxes.

01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:47.523
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:50.500
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

01:00:50.535 --> 01:00:54.403
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

01:00:54.439 --> 01:00:56.031
Oh. Yet.

01:00:56.074 --> 01:00:59.305
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or Ian?

01:00:59.344 --> 01:01:01.710
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

01:01:01.746 --> 01:01:04.180
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

01:01:04.215 --> 01:01:07.013
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

01:01:07.051 --> 01:01:09.679
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.282
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

01:01:13.324 --> 01:01:15.884
It's simple. People die.

01:01:15.927 --> 01:01:17.326
That's just part of life.

01:01:17.362 --> 01:01:20.126
150,000 people a day, actually.

01:01:20.164 --> 01:01:22.065
You know? I mean...

01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:24.126
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

01:01:24.169 --> 01:01:26.467
- Top shelf.
- The end of biological function.

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:27.494
It's as simple as that.

01:01:34.413 --> 01:01:36.881
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

01:01:36.915 --> 01:01:38.712
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:41.242
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

01:01:41.286 --> 01:01:43.618
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:43.655 --> 01:01:47.557
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

01:01:47.593 --> 01:01:49.220
no one goes, like...

01:01:49.261 --> 01:01:52.389
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

01:01:52.432 --> 01:01:54.229
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

01:01:54.267 --> 01:01:57.430
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:58.994
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

01:01:59.039 --> 01:02:02.497
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:04.942
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

01:02:04.978 --> 01:02:06.309
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

01:03:13.314 --> 01:03:14.906
Sick.

01:03:50.185 --> 01:03:52.016
OK.

01:03:52.054 --> 01:03:54.022
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

01:03:54.056 --> 01:03:55.353
Let's just say, you know...

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.825
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

01:03:57.861 --> 01:04:00.193
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:03.393
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

01:04:03.433 --> 01:04:05.264
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:07.132
when he's working in our world.

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:11.106
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

01:04:11.141 --> 01:04:14.201
So, that means that...

01:04:14.244 --> 01:04:18.146
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:20.376
And that that action
we take might have...

01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:22.976
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

01:04:23.019 --> 01:04:24.748
You're being a fucker, but go on.

01:04:24.787 --> 01:04:27.655
OK. OK.

01:04:27.691 --> 01:04:30.922
What if, for example...

01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:35.762
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

01:04:37.101 --> 01:04:38.261
Kill themselves.

01:04:40.437 --> 01:04:42.871
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

01:04:42.907 --> 01:04:45.603
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:49.511
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

01:04:55.619 --> 01:04:57.211
Any takers?

01:04:59.824 --> 01:05:02.122
Nah, I didn't think so.

01:05:11.803 --> 01:05:13.270
There! Those!

01:06:12.165 --> 01:06:14.292
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

01:06:14.334 --> 01:06:15.801
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

01:06:15.836 --> 01:06:17.827
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:19.304
What'd you tell 'em?

01:06:19.339 --> 01:06:21.569
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

01:06:21.608 --> 01:06:23.405
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

01:06:23.443 --> 01:06:24.603
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

01:06:24.645 --> 01:06:27.011
and why we went to see
Ian and Erin and...

01:06:27.047 --> 01:06:28.480
Did they believe you?

01:06:28.515 --> 01:06:30.540
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

01:06:30.584 --> 01:06:33.076
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

01:06:33.121 --> 01:06:35.555
10 hours they had us in there.

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:36.955
For all we know...

01:06:36.991 --> 01:06:38.856
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

01:06:38.893 --> 01:06:40.451
And we're next.

01:06:40.495 --> 01:06:42.019
Now.

01:06:44.866 --> 01:06:48.962
Lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

01:06:49.003 --> 01:06:52.370
So it skipped Ian.
That's... that's how we regain control.

01:06:52.407 --> 01:06:53.704
If someone intercedes...

01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:55.606
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:56.871
All right, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:59.402
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

01:07:00.882 --> 01:07:04.046
Well, I'm next... and then you.

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:07.249
We can beat this.

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:10.053
We're so close.
We can't give up.

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:14.524
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:17.532
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

01:07:17.566 --> 01:07:19.431
It's just for a couple of hours.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.457
All right? A couple of hours.

01:07:20.502 --> 01:07:23.437
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:27.203
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

01:07:27.242 --> 01:07:29.301
OK?

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:33.946
Was there something
I should know about going?

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.946
No, it's just...

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.478
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:42.457
hoping you're OK.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:44.483
Why?

01:07:45.762 --> 01:07:47.696
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:52.924
Come here.

01:07:57.974 --> 01:07:59.168
OK?

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.971
All right, I got my cell.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.307
OK.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:21.692
Hey, Wen?

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.493
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:27.697
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.468
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

01:09:32.504 --> 01:09:34.404
Call me on my cell right away.

01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:41.207
Hello?

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:43.147
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

01:09:43.182 --> 01:09:45.013
What, your sister? No.

01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:46.381
No, she would've said
something by now.

01:09:46.419 --> 01:09:47.977
The person sitting
behind Ian and Erin...

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.648
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:51.417
our grandmother gave her.

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:53.448
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.222
so they're next.

01:09:55.261 --> 01:09:56.626
I gotta find Julie.

01:09:56.663 --> 01:09:57.755
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

01:09:57.797 --> 01:09:59.788
Well, I... I'm here now,
working security.

01:09:59.832 --> 01:10:01.459
I'll start looking for her.

01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:03.435
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

01:10:03.469 --> 01:10:05.164
Look, after them, we're next.

01:10:05.204 --> 01:10:07.468
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:09.169
before we meet up...

01:10:09.209 --> 01:10:10.938
remember that time
we talked about?

01:10:10.978 --> 01:10:12.673
When to look at our pictures?

01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:14.442
It's now.

01:10:24.024 --> 01:10:25.753
Great. Mine has no clue.

01:10:25.793 --> 01:10:28.557
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

01:10:28.595 --> 01:10:30.961
with Jason at
the amusement park.

01:10:30.998 --> 01:10:33.967
Wait. McKinley.

01:10:34.001 --> 01:10:37.095
Lan? Is he in the picture?

01:10:37.137 --> 01:10:40.733
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

01:10:42.010 --> 01:10:44.342
And yours is the picture
that I took...

01:10:44.379 --> 01:10:46.108
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

01:10:46.147 --> 01:10:50.106
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:57.385
Like a firework
went off in my face?

01:11:22.918 --> 01:11:26.115
# There is someone #

01:11:26.155 --> 01:11:29.283
# Walking behind you #

01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:35.759
# Look at me #

01:11:35.798 --> 01:11:37.629
# There is someone #

01:11:37.666 --> 01:11:41.569
# Watching your footsteps #

01:11:44.307 --> 01:11:46.207
# Look at me #

01:11:47.811 --> 01:11:51.178
# There is someone #

01:11:51.214 --> 01:11:53.444
# Who really loves you #

01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:55.610
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

01:11:58.221 --> 01:11:59.813
Get 'em while they're hot!

01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:06.689
Take it to those Redcoats!

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:09.028
Column, advance!

01:12:21.078 --> 01:12:22.978
The kite is aloft.

01:12:24.448 --> 01:12:27.246
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

01:12:27.285 --> 01:12:29.845
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

01:12:38.095 --> 01:12:41.292
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

01:12:43.502 --> 01:12:45.595
This is awesome, dude!

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.773
Come on!

01:12:49.808 --> 01:12:51.799
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

01:12:51.844 --> 01:12:53.311
Hurry, dude.

01:12:53.345 --> 01:12:54.744
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:59.979
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

01:13:00.018 --> 01:13:02.748
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

01:13:07.893 --> 01:13:09.417
Oh, my God. Julie.

01:13:09.461 --> 01:13:10.428
- What?
- Look.

01:13:10.462 --> 01:13:12.362
There's Kahlil.

01:13:12.397 --> 01:13:13.990
Should we?

01:13:14.033 --> 01:13:15.694
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

01:13:15.735 --> 01:13:18.033
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

01:13:18.071 --> 01:13:19.902
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

01:13:19.939 --> 01:13:21.531
I don't fucking believe them.

01:13:21.574 --> 01:13:24.065
OK, we gotta clear out.

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:32.140
Excuse me.

01:13:57.278 --> 01:13:58.802
- Ladies.
- Boys.

01:13:58.846 --> 01:13:59.835
What's going on?

01:14:01.048 --> 01:14:02.879
Hey, Julie.

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:05.351
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

01:14:05.386 --> 01:14:07.081
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

01:14:07.121 --> 01:14:08.952
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

01:14:08.989 --> 01:14:10.820
Let go of me!

01:14:10.858 --> 01:14:11.916
Julie.

01:14:13.193 --> 01:14:14.353
Julie!

01:14:44.726 --> 01:14:46.159
Sweet.

01:14:49.432 --> 01:14:50.421
Yeah!

01:14:53.769 --> 01:14:55.031
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

01:15:00.776 --> 01:15:02.573
Julie!

01:15:12.254 --> 01:15:13.812
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

01:15:33.443 --> 01:15:36.640
Julie! No, wait, wait.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:39.148
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

01:15:39.182 --> 01:15:41.912
Let me explain this to you.

01:15:45.822 --> 01:15:47.255
Julie, look out!

01:15:53.798 --> 01:15:54.890
Julie!

01:16:01.205 --> 01:16:02.729
Cut him off!

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:28.497
OK, OK.

01:16:30.869 --> 01:16:32.234
Stay back! He's dangerous!

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:36.800
I got him.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.037
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

01:16:39.078 --> 01:16:40.272
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

01:16:40.312 --> 01:16:42.576
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

01:16:42.614 --> 01:16:44.479
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:47.482
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.384
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:51.822
Who? She's next!

01:17:10.443 --> 01:17:11.774
Kevin.

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.051
Fire!

01:17:25.092 --> 01:17:27.287
Kevin.

01:17:27.328 --> 01:17:30.855
You saved my life.

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:37.969
Thanks for that, McKinley.

01:17:38.005 --> 01:17:39.973
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

01:17:40.007 --> 01:17:41.474
We have to get out of here now.

01:17:41.509 --> 01:17:42.669
What's the deal?

01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:45.304
Lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

01:17:45.346 --> 01:17:47.473
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

01:17:47.515 --> 01:17:49.278
- He's the clue.
- What?

01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:51.307
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

01:17:53.488 --> 01:17:55.456
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:59.551
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

01:18:02.664 --> 01:18:03.722
You followed me!

01:18:03.765 --> 01:18:05.665
Oh! You are paranoid.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.759
But, hey, I saw what happened.

01:18:07.802 --> 01:18:10.566
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

01:18:10.605 --> 01:18:12.004
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.837
You didn't even believe me!

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:16.935
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

01:18:16.978 --> 01:18:18.673
Then you have
to stay away from me!

01:18:18.713 --> 01:18:21.944
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

01:18:26.656 --> 01:18:28.783
Oh, no way.

01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:32.154
Do I cause your death?

01:18:33.829 --> 01:18:35.763
Just like you caused Erin's?

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:38.790
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

01:18:38.834 --> 01:18:41.701
You have a vision? Was I in it?

01:18:41.737 --> 01:18:43.637
Was I in a picture?

01:18:45.908 --> 01:18:48.342
Just tell me how to start it off!

01:18:48.377 --> 01:18:51.039
Let's get this over with!

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.810
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

01:18:53.849 --> 01:18:55.147
Then it'll all be over!

01:18:55.185 --> 01:18:58.154
What do I care? It skipped me.

01:18:58.188 --> 01:18:59.985
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

01:19:00.023 --> 01:19:02.890
I'm not dying!

01:19:15.138 --> 01:19:17.197
You see?

01:19:17.241 --> 01:19:18.503
I'm not gonna die!

01:19:18.542 --> 01:19:20.840
It's you, Wendy! You're dead!

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.677
# Came back down
from this fight #

01:19:59.717 --> 01:20:01.207
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

01:20:01.252 --> 01:20:02.617
# And make you right #

01:20:02.653 --> 01:20:03.677
Thank you.

01:20:03.721 --> 01:20:06.485
# Bruno's drops
threaten her... #

01:20:06.524 --> 01:20:07.752
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:09.191
Don't we get off at Booth?

01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:11.092
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

01:20:11.128 --> 01:20:12.686
Oh, that's right.

01:20:13.931 --> 01:20:16.399
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

01:20:16.433 --> 01:20:19.197
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

01:20:19.235 --> 01:20:21.430
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

01:20:21.704 --> 01:20:23.001
If you don't have turkey
for one Thanksgiving...

01:20:23.039 --> 01:20:24.666
is that really gonna kill you?

01:20:25.675 --> 01:20:28.804
# There is someone #

01:20:28.845 --> 01:20:32.303
# Walking behind you #

01:20:32.349 --> 01:20:35.648
# Turn around #

01:20:35.686 --> 01:20:39.383
# Look at me #

01:20:39.423 --> 01:20:42.790
# There is someone #

01:20:42.826 --> 01:20:46.694
# Watching your footsteps #

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:47.992
# Turn around #

01:20:55.539 --> 01:20:58.805
# There is someone #

01:20:58.843 --> 01:21:02.973
# Who really needs you #

01:21:03.014 --> 01:21:05.881
# Here's my heart #

01:21:40.452 --> 01:21:41.817
This is Booth Street.

01:21:41.854 --> 01:21:46.291
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

01:21:46.325 --> 01:21:50.386
The next stop
is the end of the line.

01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:54.194
Wendy! Next stop after this.

01:21:54.233 --> 01:21:56.497
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

01:21:56.535 --> 01:21:58.162
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

01:21:58.203 --> 01:22:00.968
I could use some air.

01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:06.070
Yeah!

01:22:06.412 --> 01:22:07.340
Yeah, man!

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.711
All right, man. See ya.

01:22:08.748 --> 01:22:09.772
Let's go, Bruins!

01:22:09.816 --> 01:22:10.805
Bruins, yeah!

01:22:26.699 --> 01:22:28.223
Hey, man, peace out!

01:22:28.268 --> 01:22:29.792
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

01:22:29.836 --> 01:22:32.237
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

01:22:32.273 --> 01:22:34.264
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

01:22:34.308 --> 01:22:35.434
This is it!

01:22:35.476 --> 01:22:39.105
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

01:22:41.148 --> 01:22:43.082
Oh, my God.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:47.850
I can't believe this. Here.

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.559
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:55.255
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

01:22:55.296 --> 01:22:57.730
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

01:22:57.765 --> 01:22:59.562
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.965
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:02.936
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

01:23:02.971 --> 01:23:04.734
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

01:23:04.773 --> 01:23:06.934
No, no, it's just, um...

01:23:06.975 --> 01:23:10.706
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

01:23:14.616 --> 01:23:17.050
I was just...

01:23:17.085 --> 01:23:20.418
I was feeling like I did that night.

01:23:21.423 --> 01:23:23.414
No. No, it's over.

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:26.325
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

01:23:26.361 --> 01:23:27.658
Lan was gonna cause your death...

01:23:27.696 --> 01:23:29.493
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

01:23:36.172 --> 01:23:38.902
Look, I'm not worried.

01:23:38.941 --> 01:23:41.876
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

01:23:41.911 --> 01:23:43.173
And, if I were you...

01:23:43.212 --> 01:23:45.578
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

01:23:45.615 --> 01:23:47.242
you've got nothing
to worry about.

01:23:48.584 --> 01:23:50.415
You're right.

01:23:52.321 --> 01:23:54.482
Hey, I... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

01:23:54.523 --> 01:23:55.615
Yeah.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.959
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

01:24:10.607 --> 01:24:12.939
What are you doing here?

01:24:12.976 --> 01:24:15.171
Wendy! Julie!

01:24:15.212 --> 01:24:17.112
What are the chances?

01:24:17.147 --> 01:24:18.512
How long have you been
on this train?

01:24:18.548 --> 01:24:20.140
Uh, since home.

01:24:20.183 --> 01:24:22.014
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

01:24:22.052 --> 01:24:23.610
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

01:24:26.223 --> 01:24:27.451
You OK?

01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:29.254
Is something wrong?

01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:09.190
Julie, stay down!

01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:11.464
Julie!

01:25:17.643 --> 01:25:19.110
Kevin!

01:25:22.815 --> 01:25:24.646
Oh, God!

01:26:36.557 --> 01:26:40.153
No!

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:43.494
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.958
You OK?

01:26:46.001 --> 01:26:48.492
Is somethin' wrong?

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.766
The train...

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:54.833
Oh, shit. Not again.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.468
We gotta get out!

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:59.537
It's not working.
Somebody stop the train!
