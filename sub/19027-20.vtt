WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:07.200
- Todd, what are you doing?
- Waiting for my moment.

00:07.273 --> 00:10.333
<i>[J.D.] OK, moving on.</i>
<i>It was time for my new daily ritual:</i>

00:10.410 --> 00:12.469
<i>Asking Dr. Cox to lunch.</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:16.379
- What are you doing for lunch?
- Not having it with you, Paula.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.144
Oh. Good luck eating.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.982
This is every spoon
from the cafeteria.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.021
And guess what?

00:22.122 --> 00:25.057
Today just happens to be
soup and frozen yogurt day.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.753
I'm gonna have tomato and strawberry.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.261
[Cox] Lunch for us?
Not going to happen.

00:30.330 --> 00:33.857
Normally, I'd say something harsh now
like, "We're not friends,"

00:33.933 --> 00:36.959
but you'll grin that stupid grin
and shake your head,

00:37.037 --> 00:39.528
like, "How could that
possibly be true?"

00:39.606 --> 00:41.574
Because it's ludicrous.

00:41.674 --> 00:44.040
Just give me a spoon, will you please?

00:44.110 --> 00:47.079
- Oh, for goodness sake.
- [J.D.] You've called my bluff.

00:47.180 --> 00:51.048
Today isn't soup and yogurt day.
It's actually salad and smoothie day.

00:51.117 --> 00:53.483
I'm still having tomato and strawberry.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.646
I'm having a weird pregnancy craving.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.681
Hey, J.D., if you go out,
would you get me a hot Italian sausage?

00:59.793 --> 01:02.728
I got a hot Italian sausage
for you right here.

01:03.196 --> 01:06.962
People think I luck into these
situations, but it's really hard work.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.297
You know what else is hard?
I should go.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.428
I think I may vomit.

01:12.439 --> 01:16.466
<i>[J.D.] Some doctors like to change</i>
<i>into their streets for lunch. Not me.</i>

01:16.543 --> 01:19.171
<i>I like how the world</i>
<i>reacts to me as a doctor.</i>

01:19.245 --> 01:22.737
<i>Whether it's a friendly greeting</i>
<i>from the world's slowest bagger.</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:25.478
- Hey there, Dr. Dorian.
- Lookin' good, pal.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.112
Eggs on top. All right?
Eggs on top.

01:28.221 --> 01:31.190
<i>Or a smile from the manager</i>
<i>of the herbal section.</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:33.816
Hey, Rebecca.
You got that Echinacea for me?

01:33.893 --> 01:36.384
Just kidding.
I think all this stuff is voodoo.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.158
Good to see you. Hey!

01:38.231 --> 01:41.564
Looks like somebody else
is sick of that cafeteria stuff, huh?

01:41.634 --> 01:43.966
Oh, no. What the hell?
Did you follow me here?

01:44.037 --> 01:46.403
A friend dropped me off.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.738
Eagle!

01:54.180 --> 01:57.206
Hey, wanna go splitsies
on some deli counter meatloaf?

01:57.283 --> 02:00.309
I can't finish a whole serving.
I can, but I don't like to.

02:00.386 --> 02:04.345
- It all goes right here.
- Could this be any more of a nightmare?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.424
[Woman] Guys!

02:05.525 --> 02:07.823
<i>Yes, it could be more of a nightmare.</i>

02:07.894 --> 02:11.625
<i>Jill Tracy was a former patient</i>
<i>who had once tried to kill herself.</i>

02:11.698 --> 02:12.960
<i>Sad, yes,</i>

02:13.032 --> 02:17.196
<i>but this did not change the fact</i>
<i>that she was unbelievably annoying.</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:19.464
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

02:19.572 --> 02:22.405
I was meeting a guy for a date.
I know you're thinking.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.740
A Tuesday lunch date at the market,
he is so not into her.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.746
Well, guess what? He's not.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.616
I've been waiting for, like, an hour

02:30.683 --> 02:34.244
thinking how many more guys
from my yoga class can totally reject me

02:34.354 --> 02:36.481
without me saying, "Enough!"
You know?

02:36.556 --> 02:38.922
Yogurt pretzels? Yum.
These are addictive.

02:39.025 --> 02:41.459
I'll have one anyway.
Wanna grab some lunch?

02:41.528 --> 02:44.622
- We have to get back to the hospital.
- Bummer.

02:44.697 --> 02:46.392
Trail mix?
[Growling sound]

02:46.466 --> 02:49.026
I won't. Awesome! Awesome!

02:49.102 --> 02:51.263
You know what, Newbie?
Stay. Have lunch.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.463
[Whizzing sound]

02:52.539 --> 02:55.474
Those emergencies.
I should go too. How are things?

02:58.344 --> 03:00.835
- You know that's stealing.
- Come on, Rebecca,

03:00.914 --> 03:03.178
everybody's doing it.

03:05.084 --> 03:07.416
I won't tell anyone if you don't.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.883
- Security!
- Security?

03:09.956 --> 03:11.048
We've got a grazer.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.388
I don't think there's
a security force...

03:13.459 --> 03:14.892
OK. Hey, fellas.

03:14.961 --> 03:17.794
Wherever you're taking him,
take me too. No, you go ahead.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.833
Where's the shaving cream?
Is that aisle two still?

03:20.934 --> 03:24.392
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

03:24.470 --> 03:27.496
# <i>No, I know I'm no Superman</i>

03:31.177 --> 03:32.906
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

03:36.149 --> 03:38.879
<i>Today was a busy day</i>
<i>at Sacred Heart.</i>

03:38.952 --> 03:42.285
<i>We had three separate patients</i>
<i>waiting for transplants.</i>

03:42.355 --> 03:44.880
<i>We were doing everything</i>
<i>we could to keep them alive</i>

03:44.958 --> 03:46.482
<i>while we could locate donors.</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:50.325
<i>There was Mrs. Sykes,</i>
<i>who needed a new liver.</i>

03:50.430 --> 03:53.593
<i>There was Mr. Dennison,</i>
<i>who needed a new heart valve.</i>

03:53.666 --> 03:57.762
<i>And then there was Dr. Cox's guy,</i>
<i>Dave Bradford.</i>

03:58.371 --> 04:01.397
Davey Boy, I promise you,
we're gonna find you a kidney.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.601
I would swear on my father's grave,

04:03.676 --> 04:07.043
but whenever I go there
I end up dancing on it.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.876
And so begins another round
of "Who Had the Worse Dad?"

04:09.949 --> 04:12.417
One of pop's nicknames
for me was Sparky.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.715
He liked to light matches off my neck.

04:14.787 --> 04:18.882
We've been over this. You win on
account of your father's not dead yet.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.892
<i>[J.D.] Most stress with</i>
<i>so many people clinging to life.</i>

04:21.961 --> 04:23.326
<i>Dr. Cox vibed on it.</i>

04:23.429 --> 04:26.523
As I lie in bed each morning
and ask myself

04:26.599 --> 04:29.898
why I should put both my feet
on the floor,

04:29.969 --> 04:33.132
there are precious few reasons
that I've ever come up with.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.471
The chance to escape
Jordan's morning breath, sure.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.567
Scotch. It's too early to drink it,
yes,

04:38.645 --> 04:40.875
but it is never too early
to think about.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.814
And, of course,
the ever-present possibility

04:43.883 --> 04:46.374
that I might finally
happen upon Hugh Jackman

04:46.452 --> 04:49.148
and give him the present
I've been holding for him.

04:49.222 --> 04:50.189
Bam!

04:50.623 --> 04:54.753
Still, the most persuasive argument
I've ever been able to come up with

04:54.827 --> 04:59.560
is that I get to come to this hospital
every day and help keep people alive.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.795
That's ironic, four people died
while you were talking.

05:02.902 --> 05:05.462
We need to keep them going
until we can find donors.

05:05.571 --> 05:09.200
Barbie, check on Mrs. Sykes's
ammonia level. She's encephalopathic.

05:09.275 --> 05:12.642
Gandhi, review Dennison's chart
and get me a consent.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.805
Bobbo, get on the horn
to your cronies at local hospitals

05:15.882 --> 05:17.247
and get me a donor update.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.877
Fine. Some of the boys
are coming over tonight.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.150
I'll bring it up to Morrison while he
sets up the projector for stag flicks.

05:24.223 --> 05:27.283
Don't need the visual
of old men with erections.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.260
And now it's in my head forever.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.425
Sorry. Go step up Davey Bradford's
dialysis to take your mind off of it.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.265
- Newbie, feel like a sandwich?
- I do feel like a sandwich.

05:37.370 --> 05:41.033
You feel more like a pastry.
A very doughy pastry.

05:41.107 --> 05:45.339
I don't feel good about that.
Way too easy.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.610
<i>[J.D.] I had one objective</i>
<i>in my trip to the store.</i>

05:53.686 --> 05:57.452
<i>Pick up everyone's lunch</i>
<i>and get out of Dodge.</i>

05:59.125 --> 06:02.993
[Up-tempo music plays]

06:10.069 --> 06:11.331
[J.D.] Whoa!

06:12.238 --> 06:15.674
- J.D.?
- Hey, Jill.

06:17.243 --> 06:19.973
How weird is it that we were both
here two days in a row?

06:20.046 --> 06:23.607
I thought there was a 15% chance
the guy who blew me off yesterday

06:23.683 --> 06:26.379
got his days wrong
and would be waiting with roses.

06:26.452 --> 06:29.285
- Is that sad?
- It's not, not sad.

06:29.355 --> 06:32.188
I have the day free. My shrink
couldn't make our appointment.

06:32.258 --> 06:36.126
He found his wife in bed with his
second wife and downed an entire bottle

06:36.195 --> 06:39.221
of his bulimic daughter's Prozac.
He's back in the hospital.

06:39.298 --> 06:43.564
- That's an awesome story, Jill.
- It's true.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.074
- Hey. What did you do last night?
- Turk made me watch <i>Anaconda.</i>

06:51.144 --> 06:53.476
- Is that the one with the giant snake?
- No.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.980
This is the one with the giant snake.

06:56.516 --> 06:59.212
I was back here for 45 minutes
waiting for a set-up.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.753
My back is killing me.
But I nailed it.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.288
It's about commitment.

07:03.356 --> 07:06.519
Hey. How could your intern, Lisa,
sleep with him?

07:06.592 --> 07:08.856
She's a tramp with no morals.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.488
I never slept with the Todd. [scoffs]

07:11.564 --> 07:14.089
Lisa is sweet and people
don't give her a chance.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.227
I wonder who else
Todd lied about sleeping with?

07:17.670 --> 07:21.003
- I didn't sleep with him.
- God, no.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.936
- Are you kidding me?
- Todd?

07:25.011 --> 07:28.777
Is he the big black security guard
with the hook hand?

07:28.848 --> 07:30.975
- No.
- Then no.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.586
- Am I ever getting out?
- We haven't found you a kidney yet,

07:34.687 --> 07:36.552
but I have some ideas.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.258
Yeah, this will do.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.427
Ah, what the hell.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.261
I can live with one kidney.

07:52.338 --> 07:56.104
'Cause we'll probably just...
go 'head and sell this one.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.473
Stay away from my organs.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.021
- What are you doing?
- Having lunch.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.024
Cafeteria stinks
and I can't go to the grocery store

08:13.092 --> 08:15.560
because crazy Jill Tracy lives there.

08:15.628 --> 08:18.062
Every time I try and shop
she follows me around

08:18.130 --> 08:20.963
like I'm her only friend
in the world. It's pathetic.

08:21.033 --> 08:24.400
- Well, I'm gonna go talk to Carla.
- I'll come, too.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.028
I figured.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.666
Hey, why do you think Todd lies about
hooking up with all those women?

08:29.742 --> 08:31.607
Maybe he's just over-compensating.

08:31.677 --> 08:35.135
My brother used to brag about girls
dated right before he quit baseball

08:35.214 --> 08:37.774
and started dancing
for Japanese businessmen.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.111
Todd's not gay.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.313
Turk, he has leather jeans
in three different colors.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.322
[EIliot] Barry danced in leather jeans.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.655
He'd come home
and they'd be stuffed with yen.

08:47.727 --> 08:50.218
I'll tell you when I first
suspected he was gay.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.526
It was very subtle, but...

08:56.302 --> 08:59.635
Oh, yeah, Dale, this is totally
gonna bring out your pecs.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.868
Plus I'm using olive oil
so I can lick it off later.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.136
Make 'em dance!
Oh, they're dancin'!

09:05.211 --> 09:09.477
Somebody's makin' them dance!
Whoo-eee. Whee!

09:10.883 --> 09:14.842
- Tell them that never happened!
- It happened. I was there.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.820
I think I just got the move-on signal
from a hook.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.561
- [All] Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, give me the update here.

09:29.635 --> 09:33.093
Bradford's electrolyte
and fluid balance are stable.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.903
Mr. Dennison isn't looking so good.
He's on max inotropes and in failure.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.434
Sykes is encephalopathic.
Ammonium level is through the roof.

09:40.513 --> 09:44.005
- She's circling the drain.
- Let's try to keep these people alive.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.641
What do you say?

09:48.387 --> 09:51.151
Dr. Dorian, can you help me?

09:51.223 --> 09:52.190
Sure. What's wrong?

09:52.291 --> 09:56.022
She was admitted a short time ago
and hasn't regained consciousness.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.461
Tox screen's positive for cocaine.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.637
Do you think she could have O.D.'d?

10:05.705 --> 10:08.936
She had been stood up
on a couple of dates.

10:09.008 --> 10:14.173
And she hadn't seen her shrink
in a while.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.407
She was definitely depressed.

10:16.482 --> 10:20.509
- How do you know all that?
- She told me.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.748
<i>[J.D.] In hospitals,</i>
<i>there are certain rules.</i>

10:23.856 --> 10:26.017
<i>With surgeons,</i>
<i>if the over-compensating,</i>

10:26.125 --> 10:28.992
<i>pumped-up,</i>
<i>shaved-down doctor seems gay...</i>

10:29.061 --> 10:32.224
- So, man, you trying a new workout?
- No. Why?

10:33.532 --> 10:35.830
Oh, he's glistening.

10:35.901 --> 10:38.335
<i>... he's probably gay.</i>

10:38.404 --> 10:41.931
<i>And with organ transplants,</i>
<i>if there's good news for one doctor...</i>

10:42.008 --> 10:45.341
People, I've got our organs.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.141
<i>It probably means</i>
<i>bad news for another.</i>

10:51.617 --> 10:53.676
You can use her organs.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.948
Thank you.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.684
Just tell me this,

10:58.758 --> 11:02.125
is there anything
anyone could have done?

11:05.865 --> 11:07.298
No.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.061
<i>Unless you mean me.</i>

11:18.844 --> 11:22.405
<i>It's amazing how quickly people</i>
<i>improve once they get a new organ.</i>

11:22.481 --> 11:24.813
<i>Whether it's Mrs. Sykes</i>
<i>with her new liver.</i>

11:26.819 --> 11:29.947
<i>Mr. Dennison with his new heart valve.</i>

11:31.123 --> 11:32.283
<i>Or Dave.</i>

11:32.391 --> 11:34.859
How's that new kidney feel, huh?

11:36.462 --> 11:38.828
A little loose, but I'll get used to it.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.661
Yeah, you will.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.393
Thanks for everything, man.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.901
Don't sweat it.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.730
All right, gather around.
Here we go.

11:47.807 --> 11:51.937
Now, I'm sure we all recognize just
how rare it is to get a win like this.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.344
But as we are surrounded
by patients who are clinging to life,

11:55.414 --> 11:59.316
I'm going to give kudos
in whisper form.

11:59.385 --> 12:03.014
Since I'm an egomaniac,
first props come to me.

12:03.089 --> 12:06.217
- Let me hear it, people.
- You are some kind of super hero.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.452
You're a god.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.256
You're a beautiful healer.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.889
This was not a complete
and total solo effort.

12:12.965 --> 12:16.731
It was an extraordinary job
done by each and every one of you.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.498
- I can't hear a word he's saying.
- Be older, Bob.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.598
Just because
I can't hear your silly-ass whispering

12:22.675 --> 12:23.903
doesn't mean I'm old.

12:23.976 --> 12:27.207
I'm going to my office
and tinker with my new computer.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.907
- What kind is it?
- It's about 3:30.

12:31.817 --> 12:35.913
I heard what he said, people,
but damn, that joke's a classic.

12:36.956 --> 12:40.119
And why are you not
giddy with praise like those people?

12:40.192 --> 12:43.355
Don't you know I dole out compliments,
at most, once a year?

12:43.429 --> 12:47.297
And like a squirrel, you must
gather up these acorns of kind words

12:47.366 --> 12:50.858
to sustain you for the upcoming cold,
sarcastic months.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.269
Any idiot could have seen
that Jill was in trouble.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.707
I'm supposed to be a doctor.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.341
I'm the reason she's dead.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.902
<i>Then he said the words</i>
<i>I never expected to hear.</i>

13:01.981 --> 13:04.347
Why don't you and I
go grab some lunch?

13:04.416 --> 13:07.442
That'd be good. Come on.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.923
Oh, my God.
He looks so sad.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.464
I just want to hold him
like a big gay baby.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.128
This is incredible.
An hour ago you guys hated him.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.636
An hour ago he wasn't
our new gay best friend.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.196
Leave the Todd alone, OK?
Because every time you two meddle,

13:29.275 --> 13:30.970
you know who suffers? Me.

13:31.210 --> 13:34.111
Remember when the Janitor
took that chiropractic class

13:34.180 --> 13:36.080
and you guys wanted to encourage him?

13:37.249 --> 13:40.412
Guys, I'm really
not comfortable with this.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.922
You'll be fine. I've done this
on four mop heads. All right?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.854
I haven't had a complaint yet.

13:45.925 --> 13:49.053
OK. On three.

13:49.128 --> 13:51.494
One... two...

13:51.564 --> 13:53.191
- [cracking]
- [Screaming]

13:53.265 --> 13:55.324
Better? Yes?

13:55.401 --> 13:58.529
[Screaming]

14:01.807 --> 14:03.775
You're fine. We're doing this.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.936
Does this sound fine to you?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.171
[Neck cracking]

14:07.279 --> 14:09.839
I can fix that, buddy.
On the count of three.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.610
One, two...

14:11.684 --> 14:12.810
- [cracking]
- Oh!

14:12.885 --> 14:15.547
- Yeah?
- No.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.818
You owe me $500.

14:22.661 --> 14:25.721
Excuse me? Could you spare
a few minutes for AIDS Research?

14:25.798 --> 14:28.824
Yes, I can, but I'm not sure
just how much we'll get done.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.266
I'll tell you what.

14:30.336 --> 14:34.705
We'll go over here and brainstorm
while we wolf down these sandwiches.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.638
Newbie, come.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.007
<i>[J.D.] Vintage Cox.</i>

14:41.847 --> 14:44.748
Know what I was thinking
while having lunch with Jill?

14:44.817 --> 14:47.513
- What's that?
- God, this girl's annoying.

14:47.586 --> 14:51.078
I saw her in that supermarket, too,
but I'm not torturing myself.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.386
- Would you like to know why?
- Why?

14:53.459 --> 14:55.689
She didn't come
to the hospital for help.

14:55.761 --> 14:58.127
We bumped into her
out here in the world.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.788
Don't get me wrong.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.766
If a guy gets shot
or if he has a heart attack

15:02.835 --> 15:07.135
and I am physically
the closest doctor to him,

15:07.206 --> 15:08.935
I will intervene.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.340
Shy of that, you can't.
I mean, you just can't.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.345
- It's too much to ask yourself.
- OK. I hear you.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.382
No. You don't.

15:17.449 --> 15:21.476
Once you start blaming yourself
for deaths that aren't your fault,

15:21.553 --> 15:24.681
my friend, that's a slippery slope
you can't come back from.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.716
I've seen it ruin a lot of good doctors,
and I will not let it happen to you.

15:28.827 --> 15:32.923
<i>[J.D.] And because he said that,</i>
<i>I knew it wouldn't.</i>

15:38.971 --> 15:41.132
Game time. Go!

15:41.206 --> 15:42.366
Todd, do you have second?

15:42.441 --> 15:45.069
- I'm on my way to the gym.
- That's what it's about.

15:45.144 --> 15:48.409
Whoa. Did something happen to the gym?
Don't lie to me.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.812
- We know about your...
- Situation.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.443
- You are hiding from yourself.
- Stop hiding, Todd.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.283
- We accept you.
- No matter who you love.

15:56.355 --> 15:57.913
The Todd's confused.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.186
...our little baby.
You were wrong. It went great.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.355
At first he was a little emotional,
but by the end of it,

16:06.432 --> 16:09.663
he was saying how happy he was
that he didn't have to live a lie.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.169
Then he French-braided my hair
and took it out

16:12.237 --> 16:15.604
'cause he said I could not pull it off.
He is so honest.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.675
It was great.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.437
It was like he changed
into a whole new person.

16:19.511 --> 16:24.039
God, how awesome is it gonna be
not having that pig wandering the halls?

16:24.116 --> 16:25.777
Hey, Mickhead.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.684
Is that package for me?
You know it is!

16:29.588 --> 16:31.818
You ladies must be so proud.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.723
- Todd, what are you doing?
- I'm getting my gay on.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.126
Hey, buddy, you and I should
totally have sex sometime.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.688
See? I knew this was
going to come back to me.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.791

Mrs. Sykes is indicating neuropathy.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.608
My valve transplant patient
is suffering partial seizures.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.608
How... how you feeling there, Dave?

17:00.686 --> 17:03.985
Pretty good,
but my feet are a little numb.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.321
- You hang tight, all right?
- OK.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.554
I don't get it.
Doesn't make sense.

17:09.661 --> 17:13.188
Perry, the autopsy just came in
on your donor Jill Tracy.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.096
She didn't die of an overdose.

17:15.166 --> 17:19.126
<i>[J.D.] Just like that, whatever burden</i>

17:24.209 --> 17:26.733
She died of rabies?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.615
OK, people, all of our
transplant patients are infected.

17:31.683 --> 17:35.517
We know what we're dealing with here.
Let's get involved. We can do this.

17:39.024 --> 17:42.084
Todd, you were impressive
in surgery today.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.128
Thanks, man.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.789
You were impressive in the shower.
You know, dong-wise.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.091
- Todd.
- What?

17:50.169 --> 17:51.136
Stop it.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.364
The point of coming to grips
was to accept yourself

17:54.440 --> 17:55.771
and stop being that guy.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.138
I'm sorry.

17:57.209 --> 18:00.770
This whole change is just scaring me.
I'm not sure who I am anymore.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.575
- Come here.
- Get over here, sweetie.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.618
- I know. Let it out.
- We're here for you.

Whoa!

- Motor-boating.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.547

and said we didn't do it.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.889
Admit it, we doinked.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.263
I was sad because my dad died.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.495
I wasn't.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.004
So this whole thing was an act?

18:27.072 --> 18:31.202
I cannot believe that I let you in that
fitting room while I was trying on bras.

There's no way you could have
seen that coming.
