WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.878
<i>How you doing, Charlie?</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:04.713
Oh, my nerves couldn't
take eight shows a week.

00:04.713 --> 00:07.591
It's okay to be relieved
that the show is over.

00:07.591 --> 00:09.468
Means more time for us.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.303
Your aunt sold the apartment?

00:11.303 --> 00:13.013
I have to be out in four weeks.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.516
<i>Bloody Mabel Mora.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:18.769
There is nothing more tantalizing
than an unhinged, murderous beauty.

00:18.769 --> 00:22.773
<i>I'm re-imagining</i> Death Rattle
<i>in the most Oliver Putnam way.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:25.067
<i>Death Rattle Dazzle!</i>

00:26.068 --> 00:27.152
A <i>Death Rattle</i> musical!

00:27.152 --> 00:29.988
As we look at the cast,
we are faced with an unsettling truth.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.949
Any one of them could be the killer.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.825
<i>You're not supposed to be here.</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:35.994
There was someone in his dressing room.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.829
<i>The night that Ben died,</i>

00:37.829 --> 00:40.541
<i>he was holding
someone else's handkerchief.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:43.627
<i>We need to find out
who in the cast doesn't have theirs.</i>

00:43.627 --> 00:45.295
That could be our killer!
- Kimber...

00:45.295 --> 00:48.298
I'm so sorry I made
everything messy between us.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.716
I fucked up.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.510
But I'm gonna make it right.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.387
I really wanted
to give you my hanky,

00:53.387 --> 00:55.639
but I must have thrown it away.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.024
<i>New York.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:09.069
<i>It's not exactly famous for self-care.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:12.155
<i>In this city, we push, we shove,</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:14.491
<i>we occasionally urinate on one another.</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:18.078
<i>But do we spend enough time
loving ourselves?</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:20.080
<i>Maybe not.</i>
- This is the whole apartment?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.583
I know. Feels like a palace.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.961
460 square feet all to yourself.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.964
<i>But you can create a sanctuary.</i>

01:30.674 --> 01:32.718
<i>When I created my sanctuary,</i>

01:32.718 --> 01:34.845
<i>I invested in fluffy towels,</i>

01:34.845 --> 01:36.680
<i>a fleet of soy candles,</i>

01:36.680 --> 01:40.684
and a jade egg that is currently
nestled in my privates.

01:40.684 --> 01:44.104
<i>It's about creating a safe space.</i>
- And the rent?

01:44.104 --> 01:46.899
4,800 a month. Plus utilities.
And maintenance fees.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.734
Also, you'll probably
wanna slip the angry guy

01:48.734 --> 01:51.028
who sleeps on the front steps a fiver
anytime you come home,

01:51.028 --> 01:52.529
just to keep the peace.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.656
But, all in all, it is a steal.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.951
Last year, when I stepped
down from my podcast

01:57.951 --> 02:00.495
after a difficult moment
with a coworker...

02:00.495 --> 02:03.332
Poppy, you fucking bitch!

02:03.332 --> 02:05.918
Sorry. Edit that out.
Thank you.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.545
Don't murder someone
and try to frame me for it, that's...

02:08.545 --> 02:11.048
Okay, I was kidding.
I-I'm-- I am just kidding.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.508
Okay, anyway.

02:12.508 --> 02:15.761
Some people said I was canceled.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.222
Well, if getting canceled means

02:18.222 --> 02:21.391
spending a year learning to live
in alignment with your dharma,

02:21.391 --> 02:23.727
then yes.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.270
Call me canceled.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.730
I'm at peace.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.148
Because during that time,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.692
I cultivated something important.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.903
My self-care rituals.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.199
So, what do you do, Ms. Mora?

02:38.325 --> 02:40.953
I-I'm just trying to figure out
how you'd use the space.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.539
Perhaps it's a love nest
to share with a partner.

02:43.539 --> 02:46.458
Or a home office to launch
your dream business.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.336
Or maybe you just wanna throw
fabulous dinner parties.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.839
I'm not really the dinner party type.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.842
Hm.
Well, you must have something you love.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.385
Everybody does.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.558
Hm.
<i>Maybe your ritual is journaling.</i>

03:02.558 --> 03:05.269
Or a walk in the woods.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.605
For me, I start every day bathing in mud

03:08.605 --> 03:11.608
from the healing soil
of the Pacific Palisades.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.945
So, I'm not trying to pressure you,
but there's a lot of heat on this one.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.447
So if you want it,
I'd start gathering your paperwork.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.824
You know, pay stubs, tax returns,

03:18.824 --> 03:21.034
maybe a letter from your current landlord.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.037
I'm pretty sure I definitely
have all those things.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.289
For sure.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.583
Rituals ground us,

03:27.583 --> 03:30.961
offering calm in a world of chaos.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.629
But love a ritual too much,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.464
and it can become an obsession.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.466
<i>And before we know it,</i>

03:36.466 --> 03:39.803
<i>the ritual that once healed us
has become our undoing.</i>

03:39.803 --> 03:41.680
So! You ready to move on this?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.056
Totally.

03:44.725 --> 03:45.767
Oh.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.898
No, this one's not me.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.901
♪ lively theme song playing ♪

03:53.901 --> 03:56.904
♪ vocalizing ♪

04:46.078 --> 04:47.829
They're so peaceful.
Mm-hm.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.041
And so many. Sixty-two, did you say?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.417
That's the sweet spot.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.628
Sixty-one,
you wonder if you're one fish short

04:54.628 --> 04:57.297
and 63, you're a crazy fish lady.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.386
Is it too much?

05:02.386 --> 05:03.762
Too much fish?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.430
Too much everything.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.724
Me moving in, my aquarium,

05:07.724 --> 05:10.143
my trampoline, my exercise balls.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.521
You know I like to roll from room to room.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.481
You don't feel suffocated?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.024
- No, ma'am!
- Okay.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.151
Wide-open airways!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.653
Lungs like a baby!

05:21.572 --> 05:23.991
Joy, this is your space now.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.702
Oh, Charlie!
I can't believe it!

05:27.411 --> 05:29.079
Oh God!

05:29.079 --> 05:32.416
Thirty-five years ago,
you sat in my makeup chair,

05:33.542 --> 05:35.878
and I thought to myself,

05:35.878 --> 05:37.629
"This man dies alone."

05:38.422 --> 05:40.174
And now, look at us.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.092
Shacking up.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.469
It's a dream come true!
Mwah!

05:44.469 --> 05:46.972
Let's celebrate.
Wanna go to the fish store?

05:46.972 --> 05:49.308
Oh, uh, well, besides having
already been there twice today,

05:49.308 --> 05:50.642
I-I have to rehearse.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.895
Oliver is all over me
about this patter song.

05:52.895 --> 05:55.022
- Patter song?
- Well, a patter song

05:55.022 --> 05:58.066
is a speed-singing, uh, information dump

05:58.066 --> 05:59.693
they always give to the guy
who can't sing.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.361
- Uh-huh.
- It's basically a rap.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.238
I mean, do I look like a guy who can rap?

06:03.238 --> 06:06.575
Well, I wouldn't say that's
what your look <i>screams,</i>

06:06.575 --> 06:10.078
if I'm honest,
but I've seen you do hard things.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.581
How about <i>Brazzos,</i> season four?

06:12.581 --> 06:15.292
When your character
had to bust the drug dealers

06:15.292 --> 06:18.337
at the roller skating rink,
and you were like,

06:18.337 --> 06:21.048
"I can't do a backward grapevine!"

06:21.048 --> 06:22.341
Until you did!

06:22.341 --> 06:25.260
Set medic said he never saw
a femur snap in half like that.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.762
That's not the point.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.766
Charlie, you are a <i>star</i>.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.560
And you didn't look bad
in those roller shorts either,

06:33.560 --> 06:34.603
huh?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.773
Oh, look at me.
Oh, getting all hot!

06:37.773 --> 06:39.775
I'm gonna go cool off at the fish store.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.111
- You gonna buy more fish?
- I'm just gonna browse.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.113
But probably, definitely yes.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.006
We have a few minutes before rehearsal,

07:03.006 --> 07:05.843
AKA a murderer walking into this room.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.846
Let's talk case.
- If I may, a life update.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.347
Oliver Putnam, long considered

07:10.347 --> 07:13.392
New York's most un-land-able bachelor,
is in love.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.351
That's right.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.311
This merchandise off the market, bruh.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.396
Ah! Loretta.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.022
Whom you have yet to ask out.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.108
Well, 'cause I'm workshopping
the perfect date.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.361
I mean, if I'm going to break my own rule
and date one of the cast members,

07:24.361 --> 07:25.696
I have to do it with flair.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.197
Uh, current vision,

07:27.197 --> 07:29.491
lunch, the Russian Tea Room.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.701
Or is that too Putin-y?

07:30.701 --> 07:32.786
Now we've gotten exactly nowhere

07:32.786 --> 07:35.873
on figuring out who pushed Ben
down the elevator shaft.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.749
So, I say we go back.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.251
Go to the theater,

07:39.251 --> 07:42.087
figure out if Ben's collapsing
on stage was due to poison.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.088
I think--

07:43.088 --> 07:44.965
Is this gonna be about
the case or Loretta?

07:46.425 --> 07:47.926
- Loretta.
- Then, zip it.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.178
So if it was poison,

07:49.178 --> 07:52.264
we actually have a decent suspect
to look at. Kimber.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.474
Oh, Kimber!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.727
I love it. That's so good.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.645
Quick question.
Does it have to be Kimber?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.732
She's one of the few cast members
who can actually sing.

08:01.732 --> 08:02.816
I take offense to that.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.026
That was my intention.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.944
I'm working on my vibrato. Listen.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.779
<i>Ah!</i>

08:08.197 --> 08:09.698
Thank you, Ms. Merman.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.743
Oh, a-and the thing about Kimber,
I just found out that she has

08:12.743 --> 08:15.037
two million Tik Tokkee people.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.372
Followers. I know, but--
Which is great press for our show.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.208
Now our stage manager, on the other hand,

08:19.208 --> 08:21.251
is a world-class grump

08:21.251 --> 08:24.713
who has only 12 followers.
Can we look in that direction?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.798
Kimber was the only cast member

08:26.798 --> 08:29.176
that didn't give Charles a hanky.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.845
So she could have attempted
to poison him at the theater.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.307
And when that didn't work, she pushed him
down the elevator shaft. Make sense?

08:35.307 --> 08:37.267
- Hey! I just had an idea!
- Really?

08:37.267 --> 08:40.562
What if we cut the patter song,
and I just do a look?

08:40.562 --> 08:43.565
- Oh, dear lord.
- Another detail on Kimber.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.317
In the dressing room footage I saw,

08:45.317 --> 08:48.237
it sounded like Ben
was having a lover's spat

08:48.237 --> 08:50.239
right before he collapsed on stage,

08:50.239 --> 08:53.951
which would explain why
he apologized to Kimber at the party

08:53.951 --> 08:55.786
for making things messy.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.871
We have to find out
if they were secretly dating.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.540
Do you know who else is secretly dating?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.959
Yes. You and Loretta.
And by the way, you're not.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.377
Yet.
Whatever.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.672
Your TikTok star has something
the murderer needed.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.132
A way to deliver the poison.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.677
KIMBER [on video]:
<i>Y'all, you are probably asking yourself,</i>

09:11.677 --> 09:15.639
<i>"Why does Ben Glenroy, CoBro,
look like a 50-year-old baby?"</i>

09:15.639 --> 09:18.642
<i>He's literally aging backwards,
and I will tell you why.</i>

09:18.642 --> 09:21.228
<i>Because he uses my anti-aging serum.</i>

09:21.228 --> 09:24.481
<i>That's right, it's anti-aging, it's serum,
and you guys can have it, too.</i>

09:24.481 --> 09:26.692
Are you guys stalking my serum?

09:26.692 --> 09:29.945
Oh! Uh, uh, yes,
because we are all anti-aging.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.196
Yes.
Oh.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.823
If you want, I can put you on a waitlist,

09:32.823 --> 09:35.784
but ever since Ben signed on
as unofficial spokesperson,

09:35.784 --> 09:37.202
I can't keep it in stock.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.789
People, this is rehearsal time.
Let's keep it on topic.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.040
Yes, right.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.001
Well, if everyone's here,
let's kick it off

09:44.001 --> 09:45.794
with Charles' patter song.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.421
Wait. Wait, wait, what?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.631
In front of--
In front of everybody?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.258
So, Charles, six weeks from now,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.177
you'll be performing this
in front of thousands,

09:53.177 --> 09:54.720
so you might as well
get used to the eyeballs.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.806
Setting the scene.
You, the Constable,

09:57.806 --> 10:01.018
find yourself at the end
of your metaphorical rope,

10:01.018 --> 10:02.394
clinging to sanity

10:02.394 --> 10:04.605
as you are interrogating

10:04.605 --> 10:07.608
three improbable suspects.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.860
Babies! Yes!

10:09.860 --> 10:13.530
But, <i>which</i> of
the Pickwick Triplets did it?

10:13.530 --> 10:16.158

- Tom, bring us in, please. Thanks.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.417

<i>Always</i> been that fast, Charles.

because this is just boring play stuff.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.891
Nope.
Something is telling me I can't miss this.

- May I step out to call my therapist?
- Yes, of course, you can.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.174
I-I-I don't know what happened.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.134
M-My mind just, uh, went blank,

11:57.134 --> 12:00.262
and I-I-I crossed over
into this other realm.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.599
Am I... Am I dead?

12:03.599 --> 12:06.101
Am I-I on drugs?
Am I dead and on drugs?

12:06.101 --> 12:08.604
Bro, you went to the White Room.

12:08.604 --> 12:09.730
The what room?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.565
White Room. It's an actor thing.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.192
A-A stage thing.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.902
In TV, if you screw up,
you get another take.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.570
In theater, there's no net.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.488
You blank out, that's it.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.450
You're a polar bear
in a global warming documentary,

12:21.450 --> 12:24.286
hanging onto a tiny piece of ice
in the middle of the sea,

12:24.286 --> 12:25.829
waiting to die.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.414
Happened to me in 2014.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.917
I was doing a production of
<i>As You Like It</i> in Wilmington.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.086
I'll never know exactly
what I did on that stage, but...

12:33.712 --> 12:36.465
there are now pictures of
my penis on the internet,

12:36.465 --> 12:38.467
and I can only assume
that's how they got there.

12:38.467 --> 12:42.304
Okay, well, that's, uh...
H-How do I stay out of it?

12:42.304 --> 12:44.306
Look, I've dealt with anxiety.

12:44.306 --> 12:47.434
Once I went to the White Room
and woke up two days later

12:47.434 --> 12:50.812
at a Papa John's in Yonkers.
It's scary.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.190
The trick is to find your happy place.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.776
Okay, everyone.
After what we just witnessed,

12:55.776 --> 12:57.611
we need to take five.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.821
Maybe years.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.076
Oliver?

13:04.076 --> 13:06.328
I wanna apologize
for lying to you earlier.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.413
When I asked to step out
to call my therapist.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.290
I don't actually have a therapist.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.793
Just my cousin Moses Morris
from State Farm,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.503
who I call when things go wrong.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.506
He helps me.
- Howard, not now.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.887
So, I know that we're just recovering
from what just happened, and frankly,

13:23.887 --> 13:26.682
I'm having a hard time
making eye contact with you, Charles.

13:26.682 --> 13:27.933
What did I do up here?

13:27.933 --> 13:29.643
- Too soon!
- Not ready.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.438
But, we have to find the serum
that Ben used on opening night

13:33.438 --> 13:36.233
and test it for poison.
Do you think it's still in the theater?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.943
Getting into the theater
is a whole thing.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.236
You know, Howard has a key,

13:39.236 --> 13:41.154
and if he's not in the right mood,
he won't let us in.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.614
He works for <i>you</i>, right?

13:42.614 --> 13:45.617
Well, it's a complicated relationship.
Many layers.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.495
Heard you referencing
a layered relationship.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.372
I assume you're speaking about me.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.791
Howard! How would you feel

13:52.791 --> 13:54.334
about letting us in the theater?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.461
Are you investigating?
Because if you are, I need to know.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.297
As the eyes and ears of this production--

13:58.297 --> 14:00.507
It's nothing. We just left...

14:02.134 --> 14:03.177
a sweater.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.804
You like sweaters, right?

14:05.804 --> 14:07.514
Girl, you know I like sweaters.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.224
It was actually one of my sweaters.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.851
Let me guess.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.227
A fluffy number?

14:12.227 --> 14:14.021
Vaguely shapeless?

14:14.021 --> 14:17.232
Splashes of yellow and orange
that have no business working,

14:17.232 --> 14:20.110
but, somehow, they work.
My God, do they work!

14:20.110 --> 14:22.863
Jesus H. Christ, I love your sweaters!

14:22.863 --> 14:23.906
Go on, I'm listening.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.035
Well, then you wouldn't want one
stuck in the theater, would you?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.411
I mean, think of the moths.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.331
Moths, moths.
Just burrowing in the fabric,

14:32.331 --> 14:34.583
chewing holes.

14:34.583 --> 14:38.128
Oh, the whole structure of
the sweater just falls apart--

14:38.128 --> 14:40.339
No, no, stop! Stop, Mabel! No.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.007
I'll let you in, okay?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.342
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:44.134 --> 14:46.178
Let's get that sweater.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.846
Okay.

14:48.764 --> 14:51.475
You're a genius. Absolutely.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.230
And then Jonathan told me
I need to find my "happy place."

14:56.230 --> 14:58.440
A happy place!

14:58.440 --> 14:59.942
Do I even have one of those?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.194
I-I don't know, Joy.
I'm all turned around!

15:02.194 --> 15:04.321
Aw, you're probably just hungry.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.822
Why don't you take that stress

15:05.822 --> 15:08.659
and channel it into
one of your gorgeous omelets?

15:08.659 --> 15:10.494
<i>That's</i> your happy place.

15:10.494 --> 15:14.122

I did the song!

16:01.879 --> 16:02.754
What?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.924
I know the trick now.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.509
All I have to do is make an omelet.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.468
Huh?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.928
Yeah! For years,
I made omelets to relax,

16:09.928 --> 16:12.556
and my brain associates that with comfort.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.932
I know I'm not mentally healthy,

16:13.932 --> 16:16.226
but that's okay
because I can sing the song.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.437
Charlie, this is <i>no bueno.</i>

16:18.437 --> 16:20.981
The omelet was a one-time stress release.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.192
You thinking you need the omelet,

16:23.192 --> 16:26.278
that's a hard no. Hard no!
That is a crutch.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.822
Yeah, it's a crutch! That's good, right?

16:29.323 --> 16:30.824
Look at me, lover.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.286
You have me now.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.997
I'm the omelet.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.041
Say it.
- You're the omelet.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.211
I'm gonna look out for you, Charlie.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.254
Just like I did with Ben Glenroy.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.467
He knew if he touched one hair
on your gorgeous little head,

16:48.467 --> 16:50.427
he was gonna have to deal with me.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.429
Now, let's go to bed.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.139
I've been reading the <i>Kama Sutra</i>

16:54.139 --> 16:56.475
and we haven't done the antelope yet.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.686
- Okay, I'm just gonna make one more ome--
- Charlie.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.232
The antelope.

17:12.491 --> 17:15.202
Oh God!

17:15.202 --> 17:18.038
Smells like
Jerry Orbach's laundry basket.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.457
Which I once had a nap in. Long story.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.960
- What is all this?
- Oh, just opening night gifts.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.003
They've all just been
sitting here, you know?

17:25.003 --> 17:28.131
Like flowers and pastries,
open bottles of wine.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.092
It's like a horror movie.

17:30.092 --> 17:33.595
Which is something that I could
take Loretta to on our date!

17:34.346 --> 17:36.306
But should I make it scary?

17:36.306 --> 17:38.767
A-A-Are dates fun
when everyone's panic sweating?

17:38.767 --> 17:40.811
For the love of God, Oliver, focus.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.396
- Oh, sorry.
- Here we go.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.816
What the hell are you doing here?

17:50.946 --> 17:52.739
Sorry if I was rude before.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.992
I just didn't know you guys were coming.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.827
Does anyone want nettle leaf tea?

17:56.827 --> 17:58.453
It makes your hair grow fast as fuck.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.081
Do you... live here?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.876
No, this is just where
I run my beauty empire.

18:03.876 --> 18:06.837
Ooh! Don't tell Howard I copied his key.

18:06.837 --> 18:09.923
I will give you some of
my proprietary collagen powder.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.425
Not for free. Twenty percent off?

18:11.425 --> 18:13.594
Uh, it-it-it's quite alright. Um--

18:13.594 --> 18:15.804
Unless, can it do
anything about my jowls?

18:15.804 --> 18:18.056
I wanna be firmer.
Oh, yeah.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.433
Oh!

18:19.433 --> 18:23.187
Girl, you can't stop thinking
about my serum, can you?

18:23.812 --> 18:25.564
Uh, y-yeah.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.357
I mean, who wouldn't be obsessed

18:27.357 --> 18:29.860
with Ben's favorite skin product?

18:29.860 --> 18:31.361
Right. He did use it religiously.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.363
- Even on opening night?
- Of course.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.743
And the bottle that he used,

18:37.743 --> 18:40.245
would that... be this one?

18:41.496 --> 18:42.748
Guys?

18:42.748 --> 18:43.999
You here?

18:43.999 --> 18:45.792
Warning, I smell like eggs.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.628
Is that Charles?
Uh...

18:48.629 --> 18:51.089
You know, he experiences
these little mini-strokes.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.508
It's nothing to be alarmed by.

18:52.508 --> 18:54.259
We'll just be right back.
- Yeah.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.720
- I didn't know Kimber was here.
- Neither did we.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.097
Guys. We've gotta get her talking.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.182
Can I trust you?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.059
Do you even know how to talk
to someone my age?

19:02.059 --> 19:05.229
I definitely don't, and you don't count
because you have old lady energy.

19:05.229 --> 19:08.524
Oh, she really does.
72 is where I'd put her. Maybe 75.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.651
That's flattering,
but I'll do this part.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.027
I can just girl-talk.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.570
- Can you?
- Yeah.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.239
I don't think so.

19:15.239 --> 19:18.283
Really, just go hunt around
Ben's dressing room for clues.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.495
- But he keeps his dressing room locked.
- Ah, don't worry.

19:21.495 --> 19:23.830
I brought my jimmy keys.
See? I can be helpful.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.790
You guys okay out here?

19:25.374 --> 19:29.253
<i>Hey, mama!
Yeah, we're like, uh, yass and work</i>

19:29.253 --> 19:31.672
<i>and slay and yass</i>

19:31.672 --> 19:33.966
<i>over here, like, yass.</i>

19:33.966 --> 19:35.551
Yass, queens!

19:37.803 --> 19:40.097
Mama? Mm.

19:40.097 --> 19:43.267
You're gonna love this.
Technically, it is dog food,

19:43.267 --> 19:45.894
but my kibble is 100% human-grade.

19:45.894 --> 19:49.439
Barley, chia seed, and essence of sod.
And a bunch of other shit.

19:49.439 --> 19:52.276
It also helps with heartworm.
- Thanks.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.117
Do you need to get that?

20:00.117 --> 20:02.077
No, it's okay.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.913
So, you manage all this?

20:04.913 --> 20:07.958
Businesses, TikTok, an acting career?

20:07.958 --> 20:09.251
You know how it is.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.295
Being our age in New York?

20:11.295 --> 20:13.589
I mean, you have to hustle
if you wanna make it here.

20:13.589 --> 20:14.840
Right.

20:15.591 --> 20:18.844
Well, it isn't-- that must be hard,
juggling everything.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.305
And a boyfriend.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.682
Who said anything about a boyfriend?

20:23.682 --> 20:26.059
Oh, there were... rumors.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.353
You and Ben.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.940
A show-mance?

20:36.278 --> 20:38.989
You know, as I go on hour three
of watching you struggle with this lock,

20:38.989 --> 20:41.158
it occurs to me that
we should run the patter song.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.284
Don't need to. I'm good.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.787
- You've never once been good.
- I said I'm good.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.167
Well.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.630
Ugh, Jesus.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.842
We're in a dead man's dressing room
filled with dead flowers.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.844
Doesn't get worse than this.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.722
Oh, actually, it does.

21:11.230 --> 21:14.399
So, like everyone else,
you assumed I was sleeping with Ben?

21:15.067 --> 21:16.068
It's okay.

21:16.068 --> 21:19.154
It's all part of being
the young woman on the show.

21:19.154 --> 21:22.950
The <i>ingénue.</i> Everyone thinks
that you're out to bed the star.

21:24.493 --> 21:25.911
And in a way, I was.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.371
I'm confused.

21:27.371 --> 21:29.915
It wasn't sex that I wanted.
It was an endorsement.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.376
One stupid post from Ben

21:32.376 --> 21:34.169
about how he couldn't live
without my serum.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.004
I even wrote him the copy.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.674
"I might be CoBro in the movies,
but in real life,

21:38.674 --> 21:40.467
I don't wanna walk
around with snake skin."

21:40.467 --> 21:42.094
Yeah, that could use some work.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.762
It was a first pass.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.682
The point is
he promised that he'd help me,

21:46.682 --> 21:50.185
and h-he made this whole thing about
empowering female entrepreneurs.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.812
Then, he backed out at the last minute.

21:51.812 --> 21:54.773
Which is why I felt fine
selling his opening night gift on eBay.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.193
The hanky.
I got a few hundred bucks for it,

21:58.193 --> 21:59.987
but...

21:59.987 --> 22:02.781
now I feel guilty about
giving away the only thing

22:02.781 --> 22:04.741
that I'll ever have from him.

22:04.741 --> 22:08.537
You know, Ben wasn't easy,
but he could be sweet.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.665
He was hard on himself.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.626
Oh, my God, you should have
seen him on opening night.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.880
H-He was panicking about
this red mark on his face.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.090
Red mark? How did he get it?

22:20.090 --> 22:24.011
I don't know. But he called in
someone else to help him cover it up.

22:24.011 --> 22:26.054
Meanwhile, I am drowning in this serum

22:26.054 --> 22:28.307
that I can't sell to save my life.

22:28.307 --> 22:31.268
Granted, it <i>is</i> just Vaseline
mixed with club soda,

22:31.268 --> 22:32.936
but I put it in a really cute bottle.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.689
Kimber, this is <i>really</i> important.

22:35.689 --> 22:38.025
Who was in Ben's dressing room with him?

22:38.025 --> 22:40.777
I have no idea.
But, whoever it was

22:41.612 --> 22:44.114
was really talented
because when he came out,

22:44.114 --> 22:45.782
the red mark was gone.

22:49.161 --> 22:50.913
Uh, hold that thought.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.461
Holy shit.

23:09.890 --> 23:13.393
Okay, whose lipstick is this?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.187
I would imagine
it belongs to our killer.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.231
- I have a theory.
- Yeah?

23:17.231 --> 23:19.733
- Goldie the wardrobe lady!
- Why do you say that?

23:19.733 --> 23:21.485
'Cause she's utterly replaceable.

23:21.485 --> 23:23.570
It won't affect our show
one way or another

23:23.570 --> 23:25.155
if Goldie the wardrobe lady goes to jail.

23:25.155 --> 23:28.242
The key here is to find a murderer

23:28.242 --> 23:29.785
that won't cost me the Tony.

23:29.785 --> 23:31.662
Great. That was a real help.

23:31.662 --> 23:33.330
Apologies, I have to go home.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.582
Joy keeps texting me photos of piranha,

23:35.582 --> 23:38.210
and I'm slightly scared
she bought one for our fish tank.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.212
- You've got this handled, Mabel?
- What?

23:40.212 --> 23:43.215
Sure. I've got all of this.

24:06.405 --> 24:07.865
Can we make this quick?

24:09.241 --> 24:10.909
Mabel.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.912
I hug now.
- I don't.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.085
Nice transformation.
I read about it.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.461
Your nightly mud bath?

24:21.461 --> 24:23.630
Did I say that? God, I am a hoot.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.383
You know, it's amazing
the amount of steaming horseshit

24:26.383 --> 24:28.969
you can feed the American public
if you tell them it's organic.

24:28.969 --> 24:31.138
So, all of that was fake?

24:31.138 --> 24:33.140
Your year of reading and learning

24:33.140 --> 24:35.184
and "getting serious about breathwork"?

24:35.184 --> 24:36.435
I did a lot of it.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.979
I went on a silent retreat.

24:38.979 --> 24:41.064
At one point, I squatted over a mirror

24:41.064 --> 24:42.566
and celebrated my vulva.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.568
But I think I've put my time in.

24:44.568 --> 24:45.944
I figure two more weeks in these tunics,

24:45.944 --> 24:47.946
and I can get back to
doing what I really love.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.156
Which is...

24:49.156 --> 24:50.991
Same as you. Murder.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.410
Sit! Let me make you some tea.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.454
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

24:56.288 --> 24:58.415
Oh, come on.
What else have you got to do?

25:06.256 --> 25:08.759
Sorry, we're late.
Our cats were having a play date.

25:08.759 --> 25:10.052
Ah.
You'll be happy to know

25:10.052 --> 25:11.845
Sevelyn hit it off with Chopin.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.680
It was a little awkward at first, but--

25:13.680 --> 25:17.017

- Like Joy moving in.

27:57.678 --> 27:59.972
That's a huge life change.

Ever since I met you, you've been alone.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.976
Well, you've been alone, too.

Yes, but not in the sad,

Alright.

28:10.941 --> 28:12.776

28:33.005 --> 28:35.048
Maybe you don't need to change.

She just moved in.

You might wanna monetize it soon,
or you will have missed the boat.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.970
I might sell kombucha.

30:02.970 --> 30:06.014
Or open boxes on YouTube.

Look, you maybe need a comeback,

30:50.559 --> 30:52.561
Sometimes, they get food
stuck on their chin

30:52.561 --> 30:54.229
and they don't know it
and I have to flick it off,

30:54.229 --> 30:55.314
and that's kind of a bummer,

30:55.314 --> 30:56.857
but I don't know.

30:56.857 --> 30:58.859

31:02.738 --> 31:04.031

31:04.531 --> 31:05.908
I don't want it.

31:05.908 --> 31:07.826
What if I add another zero?

31:07.826 --> 31:09.077
No.

31:09.077 --> 31:10.287
Another?

31:16.752 --> 31:17.753
No.

31:17.753 --> 31:20.255
Okay, good,
because that's actually too much.

31:20.255 --> 31:22.925
But think on it because
that offer is still on the table.

31:22.925 --> 31:25.594
The middle offer, not the final one.
I don't know what I was doing there.

31:32.434 --> 31:34.394
So I told the fish, I said,

31:34.394 --> 31:37.981
"Fish, you behave this week,
and I'm gonna get you a treat." And look!

31:38.440 --> 31:40.067
Treasure!

31:42.986 --> 31:44.029
We should talk.

31:44.571 --> 31:47.241
You know, check in
about how it's going with us,

31:47.241 --> 31:48.742
uh, living together.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.911
It's been 48 hours.

31:50.911 --> 31:53.080
Well, you know, Joy, I've, uh,

31:53.080 --> 31:56.041
I've always been, uh, living alone.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.293
I mean, I've cohabitated here and there,

31:58.293 --> 32:00.712
but even then, I found myself

32:00.712 --> 32:02.381
mostly hiding in the bathroom,

32:02.381 --> 32:04.299
waiting for the other person to leave,

32:04.299 --> 32:07.344
so we wouldn't find ourselves
standing in the same room together.

32:07.344 --> 32:09.805
You know, wh-which can be so awkward.

32:09.805 --> 32:13.100
Charlie, you are a grade-A weirdo,

32:13.100 --> 32:16.144
