WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:04.903
(mysterious music)

00:45.679 --> 00:47.679
(soft music)

00:47.681 --> 00:49.347
(birds chirping)

00:49.417 --> 00:52.751
- Hm. One finds a kind of
comfort in the woods.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.419
- Indeed,

00:54.488 --> 00:57.289
A sort of symbiosis with nature.
(insect buzzing)

00:57.358 --> 00:59.758
- Well, to be within nature,
one must learn to respect it,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.626
Lest it swallow you whole.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.396
- Oh, please, effie.
- Someone needs some wine.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.632
(women laughing)

01:08.502 --> 01:10.368
(laughing)

01:12.840 --> 01:14.105
- What?

01:15.643 --> 01:16.975
- Oh.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.409
- No.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.379
- That's positively decrepit.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.652
- It's not that bad.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.155
I knew the carmichaels
would only let me keep this

01:30.291 --> 01:31.723
Because it was worthless.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.793
- That picture must have
been painted years ago.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.864
(sighs)
- well, should we turn back?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.866
- The carriage left hours ago.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.268
- Ladies, look.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.270
We're missing the best part.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.972
It's beautiful here.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.641
- Well... It is a lovely day.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.811
- And we packed all that
wine and cheese.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.946
- So much wine and cheese.
(chuckles)

01:54.982 --> 01:58.884
- I suppose the cottage does
have four walls and a roof.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.819
- What else do we need?

02:02.022 --> 02:03.254
(sighs)

02:08.362 --> 02:10.228
(coughing)

02:11.732 --> 02:15.433
- I think william snuck
some survival items in my bag.

02:16.503 --> 02:17.369
- What is that?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.504
- Oh, be careful with that.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.373
It's capsicum expellant.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.308
William made it
to ward off bears.

02:23.443 --> 02:26.578
It sprays compressed pepper,
oil and air.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.381
I imagine it would be
very painful.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.650
- Will it work on
drunk men in the city?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.185
- If it does,
then every woman

02:33.320 --> 02:34.719
Should carry some
in her handbag.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.254
(heavy breathing)

02:36.390 --> 02:37.722
(women laughing)

02:37.791 --> 02:39.591
- Let's start with this.
- Ooh.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.193
(heavy breathing continues)

02:43.164 --> 02:44.095
- Oh.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.265
- No time like the present.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.968
(heavy breathing)

02:52.173 --> 02:54.005
(women laughing)

02:58.412 --> 02:59.744
- To nature.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.713
(laughing)

03:03.784 --> 03:05.617
(birds calling)

03:08.455 --> 03:11.422
- That is two dollars
you owe me now, effie.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.025
- Good thing you're a lawyer.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.694
- I will work off my debt
in your defence.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.295
- What does that mean?

03:17.331 --> 03:18.964
- It means that you
will undoubtedly

03:19.033 --> 03:20.365
Get arrested again, julia.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.833
(laughing)

03:21.902 --> 03:24.135
- Here, effie.
This'll make you feel better.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.139
(wine pouring)

03:27.141 --> 03:28.973
(screaming)

03:30.077 --> 03:31.243
- What is that?!

03:31.245 --> 03:33.378
(laughing)
is that a real hand?!

03:33.380 --> 03:34.713
- It would have been once.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.049
- I brought it from the
morgue as a lark.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.384
Don't worry. It's 'armless.

03:39.519 --> 03:41.687
- Ugh...
(others laughing)

03:43.057 --> 03:46.191
You two spend far too much
time around dead bodies.

03:46.994 --> 03:47.993
(door opens)

03:47.995 --> 03:49.861
(screaming)

03:49.930 --> 03:51.530
- Are you all right?

03:51.665 --> 03:54.032
- I need your help!
There's a murderer out there!

03:54.167 --> 03:55.567
(tense music)

03:55.636 --> 03:57.302
(breathing heavily)

04:01.942 --> 04:04.876
Our young adventurette group
came out to the woods yesterday.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.012
- What's a young adventurette?

04:07.081 --> 04:10.015
- It is a new outdoor
adventure group for girls.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.484
- I believe the organization
broke off

04:12.486 --> 04:15.420
From the boys' outdoor group,
the young adventurers.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.889
A flurry of girls showed up
and demanded to take part.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.758
- Right. Now we have
our own troops.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.695
- Where is the rest
of your troop?

04:25.266 --> 04:26.498
- I don't know.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.900
- What happened to you, gemma?

04:29.036 --> 04:30.502
- Where did the blood come from?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.071
- This morning,

04:33.140 --> 04:36.241
I went out to gather wood
when I found our troop leader,

04:36.376 --> 04:39.711
Miss townes, laying on the trail
covered in blood.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.413
She was dead.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.182
I tried to help, but...

04:47.454 --> 04:49.587
- You've been very brave, gemma.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.656
- Could you show us where
miss townes is?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.325
Maybe we could help you.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.127
- I can't. I'm scared.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.531
- You don't have to worry.
We'll be there to protect you.

05:00.868 --> 05:04.336
And, besides, you can do it.
You're a young adventurette.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.406
- All right.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.344
(frog croaking)

05:12.346 --> 05:15.346
(tense music)

05:15.382 --> 05:18.282
(heavy breathing)

05:26.260 --> 05:28.226
- Do you think it could
have been an animal attack?

05:28.228 --> 05:29.627
- It's most likely.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.295
- She could also be mistaken.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.997
That the troop leader
might not even be dead;

05:33.033 --> 05:34.232
She could just be hurt.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.902
- I can tell the difference.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.571
She's dead. I'm not a fool.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.241
There she is.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.910
(julia exhales)

05:49.750 --> 05:51.048
- This looks like a murder.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.184
- Indeed.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.252
- Oh, it must be the madman.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.988
- The madman?

05:57.057 --> 05:59.524
(sinister music)

05:59.560 --> 06:01.727
(indistinct chatter)

06:09.669 --> 06:12.204
- The victim was bludgeoned
with a blunt object.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.938
Holding a bouquet, no less.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.808
- A rendezvous gone badly?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.543
- Strange place for it.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.886
(camera shutter clicking)

06:27.955 --> 06:29.888
- A victor lourde...

06:31.158 --> 06:35.393
Was released from kingston
penitentiary last evening.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.362
- I suppose he was
better off in the pen.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.901
- Who is this madman?

06:42.903 --> 06:44.169
- I saw the shadow of a man

06:44.304 --> 06:47.038
Lurking amongst the trees.
Then he ran away.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.372
- You saw someone
in these woods?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.942
Why didn't your troop leader
lead you to safety?

06:50.944 --> 06:52.444
- I told miss townes!

06:52.513 --> 06:54.179
She said I was being hysterical.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.546
- Where are the other girls?

06:56.483 --> 06:58.483
- Well, the camp's
right over there,

06:58.519 --> 07:00.218
Although I don't see them.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.554
They must still be
in the woods somewhere.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.922
- We need to find them.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.790
- Well, we can't leave
the body like this.

07:05.859 --> 07:06.791
- We'll split up.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.627
Louise and I will find
the other girls.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.195
- Where did you last
see them, gemma?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.931
- They were headed
in that direction.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.332
- Take gemma with you.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.601
Violet and I need
to examine the body.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.806
(heavy breathing)

07:28.182 --> 07:29.881
(crow cawing)

07:32.219 --> 07:33.317
(girl): Somebody's coming!

07:35.489 --> 07:37.154
- Fern, khristal, it's me!

07:38.492 --> 07:40.424
- Oh, gosh, I was sure
you were the madman.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.826
We were so terrified.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.494
- We've come
to take you to safety.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.830
- Don't worry.
They're going to help us.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.030
- Thank goodness.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.632
- I thought we might
die out here.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.234
- Just like poor miss townes.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.503
Miss townes!

07:51.638 --> 07:54.105
- Here, here, here.
Let me help you. Are you hurt?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.408
- I am mortally wounded!

07:56.543 --> 07:58.175
- She tripped on a root
and sprained her ankle.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.411
- That's a pretty good splint
you have there.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.713
Did you make it?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.381
- That's khristal's handiwork.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.683
She's the only one from
the toronto young adventurettes

08:05.719 --> 08:07.185
To have earned herself
a medical badge.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.386
Right, khristal?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.055
- That's impressive work,
khristal.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.090
You could be a fine
doctor someday.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.325
- Can't be a doctor.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.928
- She's shy.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.266
- Let's get a move on
before this madman

08:21.268 --> 08:23.000
Character returns.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.069
- I don't think I can walk.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.105
- Well, looks like one of you
will have to carry her.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.084
(indistinct chatter)

08:43.524 --> 08:45.357
- Miss hart will do a postmortem

08:45.492 --> 08:47.359
When she returns on Tuesday.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.960
Take a look at this.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.598
- A love letter.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.102
With instructions to meet behind
the villacci factory.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.203
And is this the writer?

09:00.407 --> 09:01.973
- I would expect.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.442
(door rattling)

09:04.444 --> 09:05.876
(door opens)

09:09.283 --> 09:12.116
- What was mr. Lourde
in prison for?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.519
- Um, he ran his horse and buggy

09:15.556 --> 09:19.391
Onto the sidewalk after
drinking a pint of whisky.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.292
- And that's worthy
of jail time?

09:21.328 --> 09:25.262
- Oh! Thereby running over
a young woman and killing her.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.865
- Well, could have mentioned
that first.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.335
- Well, this is interesting.

09:30.470 --> 09:34.606
In court, the dead woman's
sister vowed revenge.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.907
- Maybe she kept her word.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.879
(creek burbling)

09:43.817 --> 09:44.882
- Julia.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.786
The blade is clean.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.621
- There's an inscription
on it...

09:50.424 --> 09:52.624
- Oh. "young adventurettes."

09:53.427 --> 09:55.160
- But this isn't the weapon.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.962
- The blade is far too wide
to have made that wound.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.898
I think we're looking
for a smaller blade,

10:00.033 --> 10:01.433
Like a folding knife.

10:02.902 --> 10:06.037
- I think we need to move this
examination back to the cottage.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.306
- How do you suppose
that we do that?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.841
- Actually, I think william
may have packed me

10:10.877 --> 10:12.209
Just the thing.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.780
(struggling grunts)

10:15.915 --> 10:17.448
- What in the dickens
is this thing?

10:17.517 --> 10:18.783
(julia chuckles)

10:18.785 --> 10:20.118
- William made it.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.788
Apparently, it's for floating
on top of on the lake.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.923
- What for?
- Ah...

10:25.993 --> 10:28.726
For fun and relaxation,
supposedly.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.796
- Huh. Poor miss townes
is having the first go.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.398
- Indeed.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.233
- Can you help me?
I've been lost for hours.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.268
- Oh! Dear god.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.437
(julia panting)

10:43.377 --> 10:44.876
- So, who are you, anyways?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.746
- If you must know,
my name is louise cherry.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.548
- The reporter?

10:50.584 --> 10:51.483
- You know me?

10:51.618 --> 10:52.950
- My father hates you.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.985
Says you're a threat
to civilized society.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.987
- I am that.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.624
- Seven feet.

10:59.693 --> 11:00.959
- Come again?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.294
- You must be at least
seven feet tall.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.230
- I'm only six foot!

11:05.232 --> 11:06.898
- Only?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.467
- You said you couldn't carry
her because of the concavity

11:09.602 --> 11:11.970
Of your spinal cord. Liar.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.640
- Most everyone has a concave
portion of their spine.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.376
- Exactly. I tell only truths...

11:18.511 --> 11:20.178
Specifically applied
to my benefit.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.381
- You are of the most
sinister sort, miss cherry.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.449
I like you.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.852
- You must be taller
than my dad.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.121
- I couldn't say.
I've actually never met him.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.123
- You're taller than that tree.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.459
- Oh.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.462
That I am.
(panting)

11:37.531 --> 11:39.263
- I bet you could thoroughly

11:39.332 --> 11:41.198
Whip the madman
if he reappeared.

11:42.268 --> 11:43.668
- I would certainly do my best.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.004
(heavy breathing)

11:50.510 --> 11:52.610
(indistinct chatter)

11:53.379 --> 11:54.578
- He was killed?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.149
Well, I hope it was
in the most brutal way.

11:59.786 --> 12:03.555
- Sorry, let me repeat:
We are police detectives.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.457
- He should have seen the noose
for killing my sister.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.295
- Did you have something
to do with his death?

12:10.430 --> 12:11.929
- Absolutely not!

12:13.366 --> 12:14.498
- Well, you'll have
to forgive us

12:14.534 --> 12:15.767
If we find that
hard to believe

12:15.769 --> 12:18.069
Based on what you've just said.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.504
- Well, then, hear this:

12:19.573 --> 12:21.973
Last night, I was on
the five o'clock train

12:21.975 --> 12:23.708
From montreal to toronto.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.777
- The murder was around
eight o'clock.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.245
You were still on the train.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.513
- Precisely.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.114
There is no way
I could have done it.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.750
- You recognize her?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.554
- The peacock?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.924
- Ah! Nope, nope. Nope.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.062
Her.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.331
- Never seen her
before in my life.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.500
- Mm.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.270
All right. All right.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.538
(grunts)

12:55.342 --> 12:57.208
(julia panting)

12:57.277 --> 12:59.477
- Bella, you lily-liver!
You ran away!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.679
- What was I supposed to do?
Miss townes was killed!

13:01.681 --> 13:03.615
- Stay? Help? Something!

13:03.750 --> 13:05.617
- Girls, everyone reacts

13:05.619 --> 13:08.086
To stressful situations
differently.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.754
It's an awful thing
you've been through!

13:09.889 --> 13:13.090
- Running away from danger
is a very normal response.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.059
- Tell us what happened
when you lot found the body.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.228
- She was already dead
when I got there. I swear.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.297
- No one's accusing you--
- mm.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.699
- We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.569
- After I found her, I screamed,

13:24.571 --> 13:26.237
So the other girls
came running.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.305
And bella ran away!

13:27.307 --> 13:28.906
- I was scared.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.574
- So then we decided
that fern and khristal

13:30.610 --> 13:32.243
Would go get help
and I would stay behind.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.212
- But we didn't get very far
since fern twisted her ankle.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.114
- And then I heard
the madman coming,

13:37.150 --> 13:38.482
So I ran away, too.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.985
- Did you get a look at him?
- No.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.320
- Are you sure it was him?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.356
- Why don't you girls
sit and rest for a while?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.491
You must be tired
after all that walking.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.732
- Do we believe them?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.601
Children can be
quite the deceivers.

13:56.736 --> 14:00.537
- Once we get miss townes
inside and the girls rested,

14:00.574 --> 14:02.607
One of us should set out
for the authorities.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.908
- We should all go!

14:03.910 --> 14:05.743
We can take the girls
to the next town ourselves.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.945
- With the madman out there?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.480
It's too dangerous.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.682
- We'll be safe
in the cottage tonight.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.518
- If there is a madman.
- Louise!

14:16.323 --> 14:17.521
Come, girls.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.562
(sighs)

14:24.697 --> 14:25.630
- You girls wait out here.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.498
(struggling grunts)

14:29.436 --> 14:31.769
(screaming)

14:31.771 --> 14:33.170
- It's the madman!

14:37.611 --> 14:39.176
- Wait! What?
(women screaming)

14:39.246 --> 14:40.378
Wait!

14:40.380 --> 14:41.846
- What's going on?
- Stay outside, girls!

14:41.915 --> 14:43.180
- Why?

14:43.182 --> 14:45.182
- Wait. I-I...! I...

14:45.252 --> 14:47.017
Whoa! Hey! Whoa, hey! Whoa!

14:47.053 --> 14:49.320
Watch the face! Hey, hey.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.522
Please, please. Please stop.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.657
Stop.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.524
- Who are you?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.928
- I-I-I'm mr. Osidius jones.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.130
- How did you get in here?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.099
- The door was open.
- Oh, so you just waltz

15:02.135 --> 15:05.002
Into other peoples' houses?
That is criminal trespass, sir!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.704
- I-I-I thought
it was abandoned!

15:06.839 --> 15:09.273
I-I've been using this house
to store supplies for years.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.275
- Even though it's my cottage?

15:11.311 --> 15:14.011
- As I said,
I thought it was abandoned.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.480
I mean, it certainly looks it.
You should definitely

15:16.516 --> 15:18.082
Keep it in better repair.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.684
- But that's none
of your concern.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.819
And why are you storing
things in here?

15:21.821 --> 15:24.621
- I-I-I'm a young
adventurer leader.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.691
There's-there's canned food,
tents, medicine,

15:26.760 --> 15:28.792
All in that storage closet
back there. Take a look.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.997
- He doesn't look like a madman.
Lacks that killer edge.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.841
- What-what happened to her?

15:43.843 --> 15:45.576
- That's exactly what
we're trying to determine.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.345
- Did you know miss townes?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.414
She was a young adventurette
troop leader.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.117
- No. No, I didn't.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.321
- Did you notice anything
strange in the woods today?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.059
- Yes.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.795
Yes, now-now
that you mention it,

16:03.930 --> 16:06.063
My troop did have
a strange encounter.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.665
- Where's your troop now?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.633
- Waiting for me
at our camp site.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.502
I came here to get supplies.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.404
- What was the strange
encounter?

16:14.073 --> 16:15.672
(jones sighs)

16:15.709 --> 16:17.342
- Earlier today,

16:17.477 --> 16:20.411
One of my boys
fell into a giant hole,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.814
One that was clearly
dug purposefully

16:22.949 --> 16:25.149
And-and as we were
getting him out,

16:25.151 --> 16:27.484
I heard someone running away
through the trees.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.920
- It could be this madman.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.556
- What are you talking about?

16:32.625 --> 16:33.958
(sighs)

16:33.960 --> 16:35.960
- These girls think there's
a killer on the loose.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.796
- Wh... Well, then,
we must get the police!

16:39.866 --> 16:41.298
Let me go.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.966
I-I can go get the help.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.802
(eerie music)

16:45.672 --> 16:47.505
(indistinct chatter)

16:57.117 --> 16:58.649
- Quite a lot of customers.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.451
The line was around the corner.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.986
- Yes. Uh, miss?

17:02.121 --> 17:03.054
- Yeah.
- Pardon me. Miss?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.556
- Fifty percent off
family portraits, sirs.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.059
- No, no.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.460
- We'd like to ask
you some questions.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.033
- Do you recognize the woman
in this photograph?

17:16.168 --> 17:18.302
- Maybe. Uh, she looks
vaguely familiar,

17:18.438 --> 17:19.337
But I can't be sure.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.674
- Uh, your photography
shop stamp

17:23.710 --> 17:25.543
Is on the back of it.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.480
- I really have no recollection
of that particular customer.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.916
- I think I've an answer.

17:31.985 --> 17:34.752
- There's an entire table
of these right over there.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.822
- Oh! The frames! Of course.
(chuckles)

17:37.891 --> 17:39.624
A copy of this photo

17:39.626 --> 17:41.959
Is already installed
in the frames

17:41.995 --> 17:44.428
Courtesy of
the manufacturing company.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.832
- Then why is your stamp on
the back of each photograph?

17:47.967 --> 17:50.834
- I stamp everything, detective.
It's advertising.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.104
- Ah!

17:53.173 --> 17:55.573
So if someone were
to purchase one of these frames,

17:55.575 --> 17:57.842
They would receive one
of these photographs with it?

17:57.911 --> 17:58.843
- Yes.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.379
Now, if we are quite through,

18:01.514 --> 18:04.781
I need to get back
to my customers.

18:04.818 --> 18:05.883
- Oh, yes. Of course.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.387
- So, whoever was corresponding
with him

18:10.423 --> 18:14.191
Used a fake photograph to lure
mr. Lourde to his death.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.193
- Strange.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.928
Very, very strange.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.367
- Uh...

18:27.874 --> 18:30.041
- Before you leave,
I need you to show me

18:30.176 --> 18:31.676
Where you heard
that person in the woods.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.478
- Of course.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.080
- Are you mad, julia?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.282
You can't be alone
with that man in the woods.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.950
(hart): There's a killer
out there.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.618
In fact, he may well
be the killer.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.821
- How do we know he saw anything
at all, julia?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.957
He may well be leading you
to your death.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.392
(sighs)

18:48.394 --> 18:50.361
- I have to find out for myself.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.698
I have my capsicum expellant
and my wits.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.166
I'll be fine.
(girls chattering)

18:55.168 --> 18:56.700
- Keep it down in there, girls!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.169
- I'll join you.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.710
- I'll start the examination
while you watch the girls.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.111
- Why do I have
to watch the gerbils?

19:07.246 --> 19:09.113
(girl): We heard that.
We're not gerbils!

19:09.182 --> 19:10.715
- Well, I don't want them
to see the body

19:10.850 --> 19:12.250
While I do the examination.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.118
I need you to preoccupy them.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.586
- How?

19:15.721 --> 19:18.055
- Dazzle them with
your natural charm.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.523
- I'll dazzle them, all right.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.525
(girl): I know!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.526
- Okay, gerbils.
- We're not gerbils!

19:25.598 --> 19:28.498
(crows cawing loudly)

19:36.176 --> 19:38.675
- This is, uh,
where I heard him.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.478
- Are you sure, mr. Jones?

19:41.548 --> 19:42.546
- Quite.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.616
Well, I should be off now
to fetch the authorities.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.186
Be careful.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.224
- How do we know
he hasn't left us

19:54.260 --> 19:57.628
On some wild goose chase
while he makes his escape?

19:57.763 --> 19:58.929
- We don't.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.233
(sighs)
(gemma): He's right, you know.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.034
- Gemma! What are you
doing here?!

20:04.103 --> 20:06.437
- Helping.
I'm a certified tracker.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.239
- Well, you need to go
back to the cottage.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.841
- See these broken branches?

20:10.843 --> 20:13.711
The madman went this way.
Furthermore...

20:13.780 --> 20:15.313
- Is that mrs. Townes' rucksack?

20:15.448 --> 20:16.714
- Where did you find this?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.182
- Up that way.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.117
It was open and her things
were hanging out.

20:20.186 --> 20:21.718
- Someone's been through it.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.856
- Gemma! Gemma, wait!

20:30.162 --> 20:32.496
- Can't go wrong
with 50 percent off.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.999
- While you were otherwise
occupied,

20:36.035 --> 20:37.735
I telephoned
the frame manufacturer

20:37.804 --> 20:40.871
And he informed me
that the woman in the photograph

20:40.873 --> 20:43.106
Passed away years ago.
- Oh.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.411
We need to uncover
the real author

20:47.480 --> 20:49.546
Of mr. Lourde's love letters.

20:49.548 --> 20:52.549
- The only person with clear
motive against him has an alibi.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.985
- Perhaps he had some other
enemy we don't know about.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.491
Catfishing is all the rage
right now. Try some?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.293
- No, thank you.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.363
(watts clears throat)
- just one.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.930
- They live in mud.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.309
- Miss hart?

21:18.444 --> 21:20.778
- Hello, khristal.
Are you all right?

21:20.913 --> 21:22.646
- Are you a doctor?

21:22.649 --> 21:23.581
- Not quite.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.583
I am the coroner
for the city of toronto.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.251
- How'd you manage that?

21:27.320 --> 21:29.053
- Oh. I have a talent

21:29.122 --> 21:31.722
For taking things
that I want in this world.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.724
- But you're a black woman.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.991
- As are you.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.194
(sighs)

21:37.230 --> 21:39.930
- I want to be a doctor,
but I can't.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.199
- The only one who can determine

21:42.335 --> 21:44.668
What you want
out of this world is you.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.740
- Miss townes said I shouldn't
set my aspirations so high.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.277
She said I was
more likely to be a maid.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.947
- Well, you don't have
to listen to her anymore.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.150
- I suppose.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.954
- Is there something else
you want to tell me?

22:07.327 --> 22:09.493
- None of us liked her,

22:09.529 --> 22:10.895
Especially fern.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.163
She's only been acting sad.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.632
She was fighting
with miss townes

22:15.668 --> 22:17.167
Only the night before.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.737
- Why don't we go join
the other girls?

22:21.808 --> 22:24.241
- Now, remember,

22:24.277 --> 22:26.243
It is our job as laypeople

22:26.245 --> 22:28.846
To hold those
in authority accountable.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.782
If you give a man
an ounce of power,

22:31.818 --> 22:34.618
He will not hesitate
to lord it over you.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.588
- Can't imagine the boys
at school lording over me.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.256
They aren't nearly smart enough.

22:40.593 --> 22:41.692
- You'd be surprised.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.795
Are you finished
with the examination?

22:44.864 --> 22:46.997
- Yes. Nothing new to report.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.199
We should move the body
to the woodshed.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.735
- That would be best.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.102
- Girls,

22:52.138 --> 22:53.604
Maybe we should go around
and say something nice

22:53.739 --> 22:56.407
About miss townes,
in her memory.

23:00.713 --> 23:01.678
Girls?

23:01.714 --> 23:02.780
- Go.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.115
(sighs)
- okay.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.952
Miss townes...

23:08.087 --> 23:09.553
Was our rock.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.257
Unbending and hard.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.692
- That's the nicest
thing you could say?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.427
- Okay, well, then you go!

23:16.429 --> 23:17.894
- I liked her cooking.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.030
- She was our guide
and she led us

23:20.032 --> 23:21.298
With an iron hand.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.236
- I gather you all disliked her?

23:26.272 --> 23:28.238
(khristal): She took some
getting used to.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.107
- She had a rather
unpleasant disposition.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.576
- The truth is she said
awful things to all of us.

23:38.151 --> 23:40.083
- Are we ignoring the obvious?

23:41.287 --> 23:42.719
- What?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.855
- That the killer may be
one of those hobgoblins?

23:45.558 --> 23:46.723
- Miss cherry,

23:46.759 --> 23:47.992
They're just little girls

23:47.994 --> 23:49.759
Squabbling as little girls do.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.397
Where's gemma?

23:56.602 --> 23:57.734
Who?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.203
- Louise!

23:59.205 --> 24:00.938
(sighs)

24:04.276 --> 24:06.944
(breathing heavily)

24:07.013 --> 24:08.345
- Policeman.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.413
I-I'm-I'm looking
for a, for a policeman.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.216
I've been attacked.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.287
- And this woman that hit you,
what did she look like?

24:17.323 --> 24:19.690
- Well, I only saw her
back as she ran away.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.826
- Do you have any idea
who it could have been?

24:22.895 --> 24:25.496
- Not at all, but I haven't
been around much

24:25.498 --> 24:26.630
For the past three years.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.432
Been behind bars
in the kingston penitentiary

24:28.567 --> 24:29.967
For the last while.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.804
- Do you recognize this man?

24:36.142 --> 24:37.374
- Never seen him.

24:37.443 --> 24:40.044
- Y-you were both in
the same jail at the same time.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.112
- Lots of people are in jail.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.514
Guess you're good at your job.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.082
- What were you doing
in the park?

24:47.487 --> 24:50.186
- I wanted to spend my first day
as a free man with my new love.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.990
- And you wouldn't happen
to have

24:52.992 --> 24:54.992
A photograph of this new love?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.059
- Oh, of course.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.128
(sighs)

25:02.401 --> 25:04.134
Ain't she pretty?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.869
- Uh-huh.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.938
(ominous music)

25:07.974 --> 25:10.107
(crows cawing)

25:10.176 --> 25:11.608
(julia): Gemma,

25:11.644 --> 25:13.643
Hide behind that tree.
Stay out of sight.

25:15.448 --> 25:17.281
- Those carcasses are ghastly.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.349
- They're certainly
not welcoming.

25:19.385 --> 25:22.086
(whirring, screaming)

25:22.221 --> 25:23.887
- Dear god!
- Julia!

25:23.923 --> 25:24.955
(grunts)

25:25.090 --> 25:26.290
- Stay still. Stay still!

25:26.359 --> 25:28.492
I'll pull you out
in three. One...

25:28.627 --> 25:30.360
Two...
- Julia.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.495
(suspenseful music)

25:42.775 --> 25:44.107
(exhales deeply)

25:44.143 --> 25:46.543
- Please, uh, we meant
no harm coming here.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.912
- Come here to steal some more?

25:48.981 --> 25:51.114
- Steal? No!
We've stolen nothing.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.516
- Lies!

25:53.553 --> 25:55.118
Someone broke into
my cottage today

25:55.154 --> 25:56.820
And it had to be
one of you lot.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.723
- I assure you
we've done nothing of the sort.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.257
We've never been here before.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.596
- C-could someone help me?

26:09.735 --> 26:11.301
- Use that to trap animals.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.271
But this one's just
skin and bones,

26:14.406 --> 26:16.673
So I'll skip this meal.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.142
(laughing)

26:18.144 --> 26:19.275
(chuckling nervously)

26:19.312 --> 26:21.278
- Thank you.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.412
- Get off there.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.015
(struggling grunts)

26:26.685 --> 26:28.585
(panting)

26:31.023 --> 26:32.555
- Earlier, we...

26:32.592 --> 26:35.892
We found the dead body
of a woman near the lake.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.162
You don't happen to know
anything about that, do you?

26:38.764 --> 26:40.063
- No.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.499
- She'd been stabbed,

26:42.535 --> 26:44.768
Perhaps with a folding knife,

26:44.770 --> 26:48.705
Similar to one a hunter
might use for skinning.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.206
- That so?

26:51.777 --> 26:53.777
- We also found this rucksack

26:53.779 --> 26:54.645
On the path to your cottage.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.446
It had been rifled through.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.516
- Found the sack
but didn't see any body.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.051
- You sure about that?

27:01.087 --> 27:03.119
- You calling me a liar?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.055
(gemma): Let them go!
- Gemma!

27:05.091 --> 27:06.590
(gemma grunting)

27:08.094 --> 27:09.292
- You can't...

27:11.530 --> 27:13.496
Listen, I don't know
who you people are,

27:13.532 --> 27:14.865
But I'm done with you.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.466
Get outta here.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.134
- Did you see anything--
- next shot goes

27:18.170 --> 27:19.403
Right through you.

27:19.472 --> 27:20.671
Git!
(gunshot)

27:20.673 --> 27:22.473
(screaming) run!

27:27.546 --> 27:30.347
- This man also received
love letters

27:30.349 --> 27:32.949
And this same photograph
was enclosed.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.752
- My girl was cheating on me?

27:35.788 --> 27:38.422
- Ah, no. You see,
we do not believe this woman

27:38.424 --> 27:40.223
Was the one writing the letters.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.227
- The person writing
the love letters

27:44.263 --> 27:46.630
Is not the same person
in the photograph.

27:46.765 --> 27:50.367
We believe this was a plot
to lure you out and to kill you.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.568
- Oh.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.405
(sighs)
it was too good to be true.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.576
- We are all fools
on the battlefield of love.

27:59.645 --> 28:00.877
- You're telling me.

28:02.314 --> 28:05.516
Uh, I suppose I should call
my wife to pick me up.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.053
- I-I beg your pardon?
Your wife?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.487
- Do you have a telephone?

28:16.429 --> 28:17.795
(gemma panting)

28:17.930 --> 28:20.664
- Oh, that was terrifying.
I was sure she would shoot us!

28:20.799 --> 28:22.866
- She must have been the one
watching you from the shadows.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.534
- Oh!
(gasps)

28:24.603 --> 28:26.470
- Oh, dear god.
That's a dead crow.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.338
(gemma): I wonder
what killed him.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.240
It's a bit of a bad omen,
is it not?

28:31.010 --> 28:32.008
(man): Hey!

28:32.044 --> 28:33.376
(screaming)

28:34.546 --> 28:36.680
Hey.
(chuckles nervously)

28:38.084 --> 28:40.751
- Can you believe it?
She hit me right here.

28:40.753 --> 28:41.885
It's still bloody.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.620
(clears throat)

28:47.860 --> 28:49.058
(clears throat)

28:50.429 --> 28:54.364
- Mr. Feiss's wife is the owner
of the photography studio?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.968
- The deceptive photographs
came from her photography studio

28:58.037 --> 29:00.437
And now we find that
she has a direct connection

29:00.506 --> 29:01.704
To one of the victims?

29:01.741 --> 29:03.840
- Perhaps we should have a word.
- Mrs. Feiss!

29:03.909 --> 29:05.308
- Hm?
- A word, please?

29:05.344 --> 29:06.576
- Certainly.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.880
- Your husband
was just attacked.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.517
- Three days out of jail,
already on one of his trysts.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.584
Typical.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.853
- Hm.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.889
Did you have something
to do with this attack?

29:20.426 --> 29:21.424
- Of course not!

29:21.460 --> 29:23.593
- What were you doing
an hour ago?

29:24.897 --> 29:28.265
- I was at my photo studio
dealing with my one-day sale.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.134
- You could have slipped
away at some point.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.138
- My employees
were with me the entire time.

29:35.207 --> 29:36.473
You can ask them.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.542
I haven't had a moment's rest.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.610
I only just closed the shop.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.780
- Ready?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.250
- Good evening, detectives.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.694
(chuckling)

30:02.134 --> 30:03.967
(wolf howling)

30:06.472 --> 30:09.305
- You said you went to fetch
the authorities, mr. Jones.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.842
- Yes! Yes,
I-I loaded up my boys

30:11.844 --> 30:14.311
And sent them
to get the help instead.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.846
(hart): And what of your
excursion, effie?

30:17.115 --> 30:19.649
- Well, the madman
turned out to be a woodswoman

30:19.685 --> 30:22.586
Who was setting traps
in the forest to catch her food.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.721
- Do you think
she could be the killer?

30:24.757 --> 30:26.490
Why was she lurking
in the bushes?

30:26.492 --> 30:27.757
- Checking her traps.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.327
- Perhaps she just takes
pleasure in scaring people

30:30.329 --> 30:31.595
Away from her woods.

30:31.730 --> 30:32.729
- Maybe.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.731
She didn't seem to know
much about the murder.

30:34.767 --> 30:35.866
- Mr. Jones?

30:36.802 --> 30:37.835
- Uh, yes?

30:39.037 --> 30:42.605
- Miss townes has love letters
in her rucksack,

30:42.641 --> 30:46.343
All signed by, "yours truly,
osidius jones."

30:46.345 --> 30:48.011
(hart): You lied, mr. Jones.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.081
- You knew miss townes more
intimately than you let on.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.348
(julia): Did you kill her?

30:53.719 --> 30:55.318
- No!

30:55.387 --> 30:57.154
No, no, no.
You've-you've got it all wrong.

30:57.156 --> 30:59.155
We were in love.
I-I would never hurt her.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.591
- A likely story.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.359
- I stayed behind
so that I could investigate

31:03.395 --> 31:04.694
Her murder on my own.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.029
- Why would we believe
anything you say?

31:06.098 --> 31:07.831
You've already lied to us once.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.299
- Hey!
- What it this?

31:09.368 --> 31:10.967
- That belonged to miss townes.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.436
- And it's covered in blood!

31:12.438 --> 31:15.239
- You are the killer!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

31:15.374 --> 31:16.907
I can explain.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.075
It wasn't me.
I-I-I can prove it.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.447
Stay back! Stay-- stay back!

31:24.450 --> 31:25.582
(spraying)

31:25.717 --> 31:27.450
(jones screaming)

31:28.153 --> 31:29.852
- Stop! Stop!
- Julia!

31:29.889 --> 31:32.255
(jones panting)

31:34.360 --> 31:36.760
- Julia, stop!
He's a killer.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.862
He's far more comfortable
out there than we are.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.864
- We have to get help
as soon as possible.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.233
- I doubt he sent anyone
to fetch the authorities.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.669
- We never saw any evidence
of young adventurers

31:45.804 --> 31:47.804
In those woods at all.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.105
- He must have lied
about everything.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.542
- We set out in the morning.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.744
- What if he comes
back before then?

31:54.813 --> 31:56.680
- We'll set up a watch rotation.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.486
(birds calling)

32:03.589 --> 32:05.621
(crows cawing)

32:07.826 --> 32:10.126
(eerie music)

32:17.903 --> 32:20.103
(heavy breathing)

32:29.248 --> 32:30.514
- Julia!
(julia gasps)

32:30.516 --> 32:32.249
- Oh!
- It's time to switch.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.651
(exhales deeply)
- no, I fell asleep!

32:34.786 --> 32:35.986
- It's all right.

32:35.988 --> 32:38.321
Everything is fine
and everyone is accounted for.

32:38.324 --> 32:39.856
- Oh, thank goodness.

32:40.826 --> 32:43.393
(wolf howling)

32:46.799 --> 32:48.865
(crows cawing)

32:56.008 --> 32:58.208
(loon calling)

32:58.277 --> 33:00.343
(insects chirping)

33:09.822 --> 33:11.221
- I can't sleep.

33:11.223 --> 33:14.491
- Oh, well, you can sit with me
for as long as you like.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.196
- I wish I was more
like you, miss hart.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.298
- What do you mean?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.167
I think you're wonderful
the way you are.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.537
- Well, you're kind
and confident and honest.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.640
- Where is this coming from?

33:34.113 --> 33:36.179
- I've always felt like I needed
to blend into the background

33:36.248 --> 33:37.580
To get by.

33:37.616 --> 33:38.981
But then I see you

33:39.018 --> 33:40.483
And you're standing
in the front.

33:41.854 --> 33:43.920
- You can stand
wherever you please.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.922
This is a very
unforgiving world.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.591
You have to take what you want
and never regret it.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.528
All right?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.098
(serene music)

34:04.009 --> 34:05.809
It should be an hour walk
back to the road

34:05.878 --> 34:07.811
And another three
to the nearest town.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.246
- I hope everyone will be
all right without us.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.350
That's mr. Jones' bag.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.487
- Hello?

34:17.622 --> 34:18.855
Mr. Jones?

34:21.359 --> 34:22.592
- There's his hat.

34:26.765 --> 34:27.898
- There he is!

34:27.900 --> 34:29.699
(suspenseful music)

34:41.080 --> 34:44.214
- He's alive.
- Barely, by the looks of it.

34:44.349 --> 34:45.648
(jones gasping)
- are you all right?

34:45.717 --> 34:46.917
- What happened?

34:46.919 --> 34:49.519
- Oh. I-I-I was pushed.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.053
- By who?

34:51.090 --> 34:54.190
(jones exhales)
- I don't know.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.558
- Julia, where are you going?

34:55.627 --> 34:57.594
- You tend to him.
I think I know who did this.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.097
- Let me see your arm.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.777
(gasps)

35:13.779 --> 35:16.813
(woodswoman laughing)
- huh. What do you want?

35:16.815 --> 35:19.549
- I want to know why
you tried to kill mr. Jones.

35:19.684 --> 35:21.151
- Who's that?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.818
- Please, don't act innocent.

35:22.855 --> 35:24.420
- I am innocent.

35:25.491 --> 35:26.956
You know,
y'all been here two days

35:26.992 --> 35:28.625
And it's been nothing
but trouble.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.426
I'd say you're looking
in the wrong direction.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.163
- The police will be coming
to talk to you.

35:33.165 --> 35:36.566
- I don't take kindly
to these accusations.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.901
Get off my property!

35:38.871 --> 35:41.304
- I'll be back.
- I'll be waiting.

35:41.439 --> 35:42.838
Keep walking, girlie!

35:46.711 --> 35:48.111
(watts): Mrs. Feiss
must be connected

35:48.246 --> 35:49.980
To this scheme somehow.

35:50.115 --> 35:53.383
- She's clearly weary of her
husband's philandering ways.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.752
- But what of victor lourde?

35:55.821 --> 35:58.054
She had no connection
to him whatsoever.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.556
- And, like our last suspect,

36:00.592 --> 36:03.994
She also has an iron-clad alibi
for her husband's attack.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.462
- And there's no connection

36:05.597 --> 36:07.263
Between mrs. Feiss
and miss todd?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.533
- Other than them
both being women,

36:09.668 --> 36:12.835
Both having motive and both
having ironclad alibis.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.205
- However,

36:16.241 --> 36:19.809
Neither has an alibi
for the other crime

36:19.811 --> 36:23.079
For which they have no motive.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.282
- Watts...

36:27.719 --> 36:30.152
Could they have
switched murders?

36:30.189 --> 36:32.422
- Let's pay mrs. Feiss
another visit.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.198
(louise): Bella, get away
from the window.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.701
- Rest. We leave soon.

36:45.737 --> 36:46.902
(jones exhales deeply)

36:46.939 --> 36:49.406
- Julia. What about this?

36:53.645 --> 36:55.011
- How do you explain this?

36:56.448 --> 36:57.747
- W-what are you talking about?

36:57.882 --> 37:00.050
- The knife.
I found it in your bag.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.353
- I've never seen it before.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.822
I didn't kill her.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.994
I-I loved her.
Please, you have to believe me.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.197
- What do you think?

37:16.134 --> 37:18.100
- It is a young adventurette
knife.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.336
- You don't think...

37:21.339 --> 37:23.205
- Perhaps one of the girls

37:23.242 --> 37:24.708
Could have planted it on him

37:24.710 --> 37:26.375
To make him look
like the killer.

37:26.411 --> 37:29.812
(suspenseful music)

37:32.851 --> 37:33.917
(grunts, shouts)

37:33.919 --> 37:37.287
- It's not my fault your husband
has a hard head!

37:38.223 --> 37:39.221
(thuds, grunts)

37:39.992 --> 37:41.091
- There must be a connection

37:41.093 --> 37:42.892
Between mrs. Feiss
and miss todd

37:43.028 --> 37:44.494
That we're overlooking.
- Hm.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.562
(women screaming)

37:45.564 --> 37:46.562
(glass shattering)

37:46.598 --> 37:47.897
- What was that?

37:47.966 --> 37:50.233
(clattering, screaming)

37:51.937 --> 37:54.237
Let's continue
this conversation

37:54.372 --> 37:56.573
Down at the station house,
shall we?

38:00.145 --> 38:01.944
(wildlife calling)

38:03.114 --> 38:04.881
- Who does this knife belong to?

38:05.016 --> 38:07.717
- It isn't mine.
I have mine right here.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.986
- Everyone, get your knives out.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.525
- Gemma, where's your knife?

38:16.561 --> 38:18.061
- I don't know.

38:18.130 --> 38:19.796
One of them must have stolen it.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.531
- Sure.
- It's true!

38:21.666 --> 38:22.999
My mom had my knife engraved

38:23.134 --> 38:24.734
So it wouldn't be mixed up
with the others.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.536
- Let's see the rest of them.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.275
- Bella, open your hand.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.648
Why do you have gemma's knife?

38:42.154 --> 38:43.686
- Bella, stop!

38:43.689 --> 38:46.222
(all screaming)

38:47.793 --> 38:49.559
(grunting)

38:49.561 --> 38:51.428
- And that's how
you catch a rabbit!

38:51.563 --> 38:53.095
- What are you doing here?

38:53.131 --> 38:55.531
- Well, I realized
I wasn't very neighbourly,

38:55.600 --> 38:59.002
Out in the woods for so long,
so I brought a peace offering.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.704
But it looks like you might
have your own troubles.

39:09.314 --> 39:11.313
(soft music)

39:13.585 --> 39:15.118
- I was the runt of the group,

39:15.120 --> 39:17.854
And the other girls
were constantly harassing me,

39:17.856 --> 39:20.056
So I went to miss townes
for help.

39:21.626 --> 39:23.226
The horrendous woman
called me a tattletale

39:23.295 --> 39:25.195
And told me to be stoical
as a young adventurette

39:25.197 --> 39:26.495
Should be.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.932
- So, you killed her?

39:30.335 --> 39:31.501
- My body just...

39:31.570 --> 39:33.002
Moved on its own, and...

39:33.071 --> 39:34.671
Next thing I knew, she was dead.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.541
- And what about mr. Jones?

39:38.676 --> 39:40.577
- I-I put my knife in his bag

39:40.712 --> 39:43.012
Because I knew you would think
he was the madman.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.246
(chuckles)

39:45.517 --> 39:47.550
- You pushed him off the cliff?

39:47.552 --> 39:50.019
- I figured that
if you found him dead

39:50.155 --> 39:51.554
With the weapon, it would...

39:53.425 --> 39:55.024
...It would all be over.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.827
I was scared.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.764
- You tried to kill him
to cover your crime.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.837
- What's going to happen to me?

40:07.873 --> 40:09.305
(bella crying)

40:09.307 --> 40:10.573
(knocking on door)

40:10.708 --> 40:11.740
(door opens)

40:24.523 --> 40:26.055
(indistinct chatter)

40:27.792 --> 40:29.926
- We were indeed strangers.

40:29.995 --> 40:33.129
We met for the first time
at a parole hearing

40:33.264 --> 40:36.533
A week before the release
of my husband and mr. Lourde.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.668
- I wanted revenge
on my sister's killer

40:38.737 --> 40:41.337
While mrs. Feiss sought
to dispose of her husband.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.440
- I needed to be rid
of that filthy philanderer!

40:44.575 --> 40:46.309
Just wanted to move on
with my life.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.177
- She found herself a new man!

40:49.748 --> 40:53.048
- And, so, you devised
a plan to switch crimes?

40:54.252 --> 40:55.785
- Killing each other's targets

40:55.787 --> 40:57.686
Would provide us
both with alibis.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.659
- Except miss todd didn't uphold
her end of the bargain.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.961
- And thus the scheme unraveled.

41:06.331 --> 41:08.364
- The plan was quite ingenious.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.434
- Hm. Not genius enough.

41:22.113 --> 41:23.779
- Easy does it.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.047
- Goodbye, gerbil.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.782
- Later, louise.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.252
- Will you carry me again?

41:29.254 --> 41:30.720
- There is a very nice officer

41:30.855 --> 41:32.454
Outside who will
help you with that.

41:33.391 --> 41:34.590
- Are you sure
you have everything?

41:34.659 --> 41:37.026
- Yes, I do.
Thank you, miss hart.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.996
Will you be our new
troop leader, miss hart?

41:40.131 --> 41:41.731
I'm sure you'd be wonderful.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.834
- Oh, I don't think I could
handle any more of the woods.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.202
But with or without me,

41:46.271 --> 41:48.605
I hope that you'll stay
true to yourself.

41:48.740 --> 41:49.972
- I will.

42:02.587 --> 42:04.087
(sighs)

42:04.089 --> 42:06.289
- What shall I do
with this place?

42:07.559 --> 42:09.893
- Perhaps you could restore it
to its former glory.

42:10.028 --> 42:14.564
- Hm. It could make
a cute rental lodging.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.165
- Let's not get carried away.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.366
- Maybe I'll rent it to

42:17.402 --> 42:18.968
The young adventurettes
association.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.503
- Oh, that would be lovely!

42:20.638 --> 42:22.171
That way they'd have
a comfortable place to stay

42:22.307 --> 42:23.706
For their woodland trips.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.775
- And I can make a pretty penny.

42:25.777 --> 42:26.842
- Mm.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.111
I think it's time for wine.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.313
- Mm.
- Yeah.

42:31.383 --> 42:33.182
(women laughing)

42:33.184 --> 42:35.118
- It's a shame
about the floatie.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.986
I was looking forward
to trying it.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.687
- Oh, I know!

42:39.524 --> 42:41.457
- I suppose we should burn it.

42:41.459 --> 42:43.759
(all laughing)

42:46.164 --> 42:47.730
- What are you wearing, effie?

42:47.865 --> 42:50.233
- Where did you get
such a scandalous swimsuit?

42:50.235 --> 42:53.002
- The racing ladies
of milwaukee wear these.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.304
- It's positively salacious.

42:55.307 --> 42:57.406
You're going to give people
the wrong impression.

42:57.442 --> 42:59.008
- I don't care one iota.

42:59.143 --> 43:00.877
- And you shouldn't.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.812
- Perhaps I should acquire one?

43:02.881 --> 43:05.348
William wouldn't know
what to do with himself.

43:05.350 --> 43:06.415
(laughing)

43:06.451 --> 43:07.850
- Please don't.

43:07.986 --> 43:10.019
A full body suit
is obviously the elegant choice.

43:10.021 --> 43:11.254
- Oh, hush!

43:11.389 --> 43:13.823
Your swimsuit looks like
my grandmother's bloomers.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.424
(laughing)

43:15.460 --> 43:16.759
- I'll have you know
my grandmother

43:16.894 --> 43:18.428
Was quite something.
She was arrested three times

43:18.563 --> 43:19.695
Before she turned 20.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.430
- Still looks like bloomers.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.367
- I'm afraid I have
to agree, louise.

43:24.369 --> 43:25.367
- Miss hart?

43:25.403 --> 43:28.104
- Hm? Don't drag me into this.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.272
I'm just trying to enjoy
my summer retreat.

43:30.342 --> 43:31.607
(giggling)

43:31.610 --> 43:33.075
- Who drank all the wine?

43:33.712 --> 43:34.910
(both): Julia!

43:36.114 --> 43:38.714
(all laughing)

43:42.053 --> 43:44.587
(mysterious music)
