WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:03.712
- Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

00:04.879 --> 00:08.675
- Austin!
[cheering]

00:08.717 --> 00:10.927
- Austin is one
of my favorite cities

00:10.969 --> 00:12.470
in the entire world.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.682
- So, with Robyn, I cut
the pie in half mentally

00:15.724 --> 00:17.017
and put it in the freezer.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.351
- I don't know what
she's talking about.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.478
- Withholding information,
omission of truth,

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
is a lie.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.023
I'm gonna unthaw that pie

00:23.064 --> 00:25.233
when you tell the truth
and confess your sins.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.071
- Why would you be
photographed again?

00:30.113 --> 00:33.616
- I don't care.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.201
- I'm aware of the phone call
that your mom

00:35.243 --> 00:36.453
made to my in-law

00:36.494 --> 00:38.496
saying that she submitted
my name to a shrine.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.248
- My mom?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.500
- She called my in-law,
Lebe Iwu.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.003
- Your in-law,
Lebe, I don't know.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.087
That's my sister's friend.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.213
- She's not your friend?

00:47.255 --> 00:48.381
So, why are you
announcing her

00:48.423 --> 00:50.467
at your-your daughter's
sip and see?

00:50.508 --> 00:54.179
- When I think of
a Nigerian woman

00:54.220 --> 00:57.390
filled with tradition,
I think of Lebe.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.814
- Who announces somebody
as someone you want

01:04.856 --> 01:07.567
your daughter to emulate,
if that's not your friend?

01:10.653 --> 01:12.072
- So, why are you
announcing her at

01:12.113 --> 01:15.075
your-your daughter's
sip and see?

01:15.116 --> 01:17.202
- That was--
that was-- no.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.620
- Oh, she was there?
- Yeah.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.080
- I was under the impression
this whole conversation

01:20.121 --> 01:21.664
that you didn't
really know her.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.208
- I mean, that's
my sister's friend.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.250
That's my--
- But you hon--

01:24.292 --> 01:25.460
she said she honored her?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.087
- You honored her at
your daughter's party.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.588
- It's a little baffling
that Wendy is saying

01:28.630 --> 01:31.633
that she does not
know Lebe very well

01:31.675 --> 01:33.927
when Lebe got a gele.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.429
That is an intimate thing.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.264
You don't just give that
to any Jane on the street.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.642
And it's not like Wendy
to not tell the truth.

01:40.684 --> 01:44.354
So, I'm just like,
why are you lying?

01:44.396 --> 01:47.273
- Ivy was friends
with Lebe.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.775
So, yeah, she was at
my daughter's sip and see.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.110
She got a head tie.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.404
But if we're being
quite honest, so did Gizelle.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.408
So, how about that?

01:56.449 --> 01:57.617
- You said she honored her.

01:57.659 --> 01:58.576
- You honored her at
your daughter's party.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.703
You honored her.
- Were you there,

01:59.744 --> 02:00.995
or were you still
in L.A. smoking crack?

02:01.037 --> 02:02.205
- Oh!
- Crack 'cause that's
what I smoke?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.707
Be careful with
the allegations, honey.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.333
Nobody is smoking crack
over here.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.210
Wendy saying that
I am doing crack

02:07.252 --> 02:08.503
is another deflection.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.131
It's like just own up
to what you did.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.799
You and your family
tried to attack me,

02:12.841 --> 02:15.051
and you're mad that I got
a seat at the table.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.720
Smoking crack-- get
the hell outta here.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.723
- Okay. We are really
getting into this.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.141
- Gonna put that out there.
- Just crack?

02:21.182 --> 02:23.268
We went to crack?
- She can't--

02:23.309 --> 02:24.853
because that's a reach.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.689
- Do I have a what?

02:28.648 --> 02:30.358
- If it-- if it quacks
like a duck,

02:30.400 --> 02:32.402
then guess what.
Crack it is.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.821
- We shouldn't put out, like,
drug accusations on the floor.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.157
- Oh, it's-it's-- she said--
- Unless it's true.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.825
- Let's not put out
any allegations.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.410
Let's be clear.
- But she-she backed up--

02:40.452 --> 02:41.536
- Let's not put out
any allegations.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.371
- Okay.
- This is too much.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.332
- The tension is as thick
as concrete, right here,

02:46.374 --> 02:48.376
and I'm trying to
facilitate in this group

02:48.418 --> 02:51.504
all of us being able to
at least communicate.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.299
I don't need to see
two beautiful Nigerian women

02:54.341 --> 02:55.675
going at it like that.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.718
- We'll have dinner,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.345
and we'll just try
to keep it light.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.680
- As a group collectively,
if we're gonna move together

03:00.722 --> 03:03.933
and-and move on,
enough is enough.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.190
- All right. All right.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.275
- Just dance.
- Let's dance. Let's dance.

03:12.317 --> 03:17.530
Oh, go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.907
- Hold on. Hold on,
let me work it out for you.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.284
- Girl, your booty out.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.744
- Yeah.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.381
- Candiace, real quick.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.299
As far as me...
- Yes.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.467
- And her...
- Yes.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.802
- Please don't
talk about that.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.303
I'm asking you that
as my friend.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.721
- Okay.
- Do your own thing.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.098
- Okay.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.100
I don't mind that Wendy is
telling me how she feels,

03:45.141 --> 03:48.019
but I'm not going to
change my stripes

03:48.061 --> 03:49.562
for anyone's comfort.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.606
I want to make sure
that this girl,

03:51.648 --> 03:54.067
who is clearly
going through it

03:54.109 --> 03:57.070
with the shrine people,
is okay.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.239
- Okay, we gotta jet.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.740
- All right, I'm leaving.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.371
**

04:06.413 --> 04:10.959
- Ooh, ooh,
my hair situation.

04:11.001 --> 04:22.345
**

04:22.387 --> 04:24.639
- Yes, it's a winner.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.725
- How many boots
did you pack?

04:26.766 --> 04:28.143
- I brought a lot.
- She said, "Eight."

04:28.184 --> 04:29.185
- I told you I was
bringing my--

04:29.227 --> 04:30.228
- Eight.
- Eight?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.312
- I think around four.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.355
- Four pairs of boots?
- Okay, four.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.690
- Yes, I love boots.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.275
- That you already--
I'll go back to my backseat.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.444
- See y'all at
the restaurant!

04:39.738 --> 04:41.364
- I think today was
overwhelming, though.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.699
- Yes.
That was just crazy.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.700
- Like, crackhead?
Like, that was just crazy?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.201
- That is serious.
- It is.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.578
It's incredibly defamatory.
It's incredibly defamatory.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.746
- All of it, well--
- She should apologize for that.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.456
- She's not going to
because she's upset

04:49.497 --> 04:51.708
about the scenario
and her mom.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.960
And for her to admit
that any conversation

04:54.002 --> 04:55.420
like that transpired

04:55.462 --> 04:57.589
would admit that her mom
consults with a shrine

04:57.630 --> 04:58.882
or, like, has interaction
with a shrine.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.175
Like, who can admit that?

05:00.216 --> 05:01.676
I'm open to anything,
even just saying,

05:01.718 --> 05:03.928
"Girl, I didn't know,"
'cause mamas be crazy, right?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.973
But just the whole dismissal
is ridiculous.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.641
- How are you feeling?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.727
- You know this woman has
called me everything

05:10.769 --> 05:12.562
but a child of God.
- Yeah.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.814
- We're wondering why me
and her don't see eye to eye?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.316
Yeah, okay.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.318
- I think there is a space
for you all to see eye to eye.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.736
- There is nothing
to salvage.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.279
There's no relationship there.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.655
- Oh, man.
[sighs]

05:22.697 --> 05:33.166
**

05:33.208 --> 05:35.293
- Thank you.
- We have a reservation.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.670
- I'll show you
right this way.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.338
- Okay.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.007
This is cute.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.175
I'm about to sit
right here.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.343
- What a beautiful setting.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.679
- Isn't it nice?
- It is gorgeous.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.305
- How we doin'?
- Hi. How are you?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.598
- Hello.
- Good. My name is Brayden.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.557
I'll be taking care of y'all.
I'm doing good.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.600
How are y'all?
- Wonderful.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.893
- Good, how are you?
- We're great.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.186
- You want me to give you
a rundown of the menu

05:53.228 --> 05:54.062
or tell you what's
good real quick?

05:54.104 --> 05:55.271
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.189
- Yeah, please.
- So, we mainly specialize

05:56.231 --> 05:57.148
on our margarita pitchers here.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.191
We can make 'em
spicy or skinny.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.401
- Yes, great.
- Yes, bring it on.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.361
- Need some readers?
- Yes. I forgot them.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.030
- Grandma, put
your lights down.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.366
- Jason reads me the menus
when we go out to dinner.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.867
I promise you.
- Stop it.

06:07.909 --> 06:08.910
- He's like, "All right,
Gizelle, I got it."

06:08.952 --> 06:10.495
I'm like, "Do they
have any fish?"

06:10.537 --> 06:12.247
He's like...
- I do that for Gordon, too.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.749
See? We-we have
a lot in common.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.878
- Can we do
a reposado picture?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.046
- So, why don't you
just get two of those?

06:20.088 --> 06:20.922
- Two?
- Yeah.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.298
- Okay, perfect.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.383
- And then we're gonna order,
um, a bunch of stuff

06:23.425 --> 06:24.759
for the table,
whatever your recommend.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.678
- I would honestly--
I got you.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.888
I can do the masa fries,
the pecan spread,

06:28.930 --> 06:30.223
bacon wrapped dates.

06:30.265 --> 06:30.890
Y'all want one of those one?
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.058
- Yes, ma'am.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.601
- I'm too tired to chew.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.229
So, I'm just gonna nosh on
whatever you all have.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.772
- Okay.
- You're too tired to chew.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.566
You just wanna swallow the food?
- She's looking not to eat.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.650
- No, no, no,
I'm going to eat.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.818
- That's what she does
with-with Ray.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.278
She just swallows.
- I need you to stop.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.363
- Eww. Are you still--
do you do that?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.740
- Swallow.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.949
- That's right.
You don't do that.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.034
- Who does that?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.326
- Let's take a vote.
- Like, always?

06:50.368 --> 06:52.871
- Okay, excuse me.
Who at the table, swallows?

06:57.042 --> 06:59.294
- What?
[laughing]

06:59.336 --> 07:01.921
- Oh, my God!

07:01.963 --> 07:03.423
- Coming up next...

07:03.465 --> 07:05.383
- That's about 150 proof.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.676
- What?
Cheers!

07:06.718 --> 07:08.386
- Y'all-y'all--
- Austin.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.721
- Ahh!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.598
- You need to
be accountable!

07:11.639 --> 07:14.768
- You compromised the integrity
of our entire group.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.529
- Wait, who, at
the table, swallows?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.534
- What?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.578
- I mean, I-I'm
very good at it. So...

07:33.620 --> 07:35.163
- Clearly.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.248
- Oh, my God!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.792
- I believe her.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.295
- M'kay, Robyn be putting
that mouth to work.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.922
[laughing]

07:43.963 --> 07:46.257
- We, for some reason,
tend to bond

07:46.299 --> 07:50.011
over nasty sexual
conversations,

07:50.053 --> 07:54.307
like swallowing
cheating-ass men's penis juices.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.725
I love it.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.144
- And given the headlines,
wouldn't be swallowing it.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.063
Girl, you don't know
what you're drinking.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.692
- I'm the only one?
- Myself, as well.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.652
Mia, what was
your stance? Sorry.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.404
- No.
Like, once I got married,

08:07.445 --> 08:09.572
I stopped doing--
like, I-I don't swallow.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.700
- I have, but I don't.
[laughing]

08:11.741 --> 08:13.910
- Will you catch it
in your mouth?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.078
- Oh, Lord.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.538
- Oh, I catch it.
I catch it in my mouth.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.664
- No.

08:17.706 --> 08:18.873
- You don't catch
it in your mouth?

08:18.915 --> 08:19.874
- And then you spit it out?
- Can-can we--

08:19.916 --> 08:20.875
can we move up off
the-the snark?

08:20.917 --> 08:22.252
Swallowing the snark?
- Oh, yes.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.294
I mean, I can see--
I can see how it's different.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.504
- I'm-I'm about
to throw up.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.839
[laughing]

08:25.880 --> 08:28.091
- I would prefer pee on me
before you do that.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.009
- Are you serious?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.011
- I would be peed on.
- Oh!

08:31.052 --> 08:33.388
Why would you be peed on?
- Pee on me, please.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.057
- Oh, my God, is that what
they're doing over there?

08:36.099 --> 08:38.518
I don't even do that,
but, you know,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.228
I think it's
on brand for her.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.563
- Men don't drink water.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.106
What type of pee smell
is that gonna be?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.274
- Exactly, that's why you
don't swallow the--

08:44.315 --> 08:45.275
- You do it in the shower.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.401
- How the hell
did we get here?

08:46.443 --> 08:47.861
- You wanna do
the peeing, too?

08:47.902 --> 08:49.946
- Why are you smiling like you
get peed on every Sunday?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.449
- Do you eat oysters?

08:52.490 --> 08:53.408
- No.
- I just can't.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.617
I'm having a moment.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.660
- You don't eat oysters,
but you swallow cum?

08:55.702 --> 08:56.828
- Yes.
- See? See what I'm saying?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.620
- Come on, Robyn.
- I'm not good with that.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.747
[laughing]

08:58.788 --> 09:00.081
- What the (BLEEP)?
- You don't, okay.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.917
So, are you swallowing it
because you love the man?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.085
- I'm done, I'm done.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.587
- Like, you just feel like
it turns him on?

09:05.628 --> 09:06.588
Like, is that
why you do it?

09:06.629 --> 09:07.547
- Yes, I feel like
that's just

09:07.589 --> 09:08.631
a part of being intimate.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.133
- No, that's a part
of your intimacy.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.217
- I don't think
that that-- yeah.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.552
- No.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.720
- I'm trying to understand
how you start then stop.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.430
- Right?
And you get up and bleh.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.723
- You know?
- No, you wait

09:16.765 --> 09:18.141
until he falls asleep,
and then you let it go.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.602
- So, you let it
marinate for, like--

09:20.643 --> 09:22.270
- Now, that's worse.
- Oh, hell no.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.565
- That's-that's--
Ashley, that's imprisonment.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.150
[laughing]

09:27.192 --> 09:29.736
Your mouth is held--
holding it hostage to his cum.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.530
- That's worse.
- Do you lick booty hole?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.449
- Oh, hell no.
- Lick booty hole?

09:34.491 --> 09:35.450
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.576
- Take-take a poll.
- No.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.994
- No, I don't want mine.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.245
I don't-don't get near mine.
- I've had mine licked.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.205
- I'm not getting near yours.
- Have you ever?

09:40.246 --> 09:41.414
I feel like you have.
- No, no.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.207
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:42.248 --> 09:42.624
- I have not.
Have you?

09:42.665 --> 09:43.917
- I have.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.294
- Everybody has eaten ass
in some point in time.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.796
- So, how does it taste?
Does it taste like--

09:47.837 --> 09:49.506
- Like ass.

09:49.547 --> 09:50.715
- You learn something
new every day.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.676
- Every day.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.010
- Okay, but you try
to act like you don't

09:54.052 --> 09:55.470
put the balls in your mouth,
and we know you do.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.763
- Oh.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.014
- Why are you talking
to me like that?

09:58.056 --> 09:59.140
[laughing]

09:59.182 --> 10:00.558
- So, do you know
about tea bagging?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.477
- Balls?
[laughing]

10:02.519 --> 10:03.812
Right?

10:03.853 --> 10:05.647
As you move forward in life,
you have to come up

10:05.689 --> 10:07.482
with creative ways.
- Yes, that's true.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.733
- So you can please
one another.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.026
There's nothing
wrong with that.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.320
But I don't know what's
happening at this table,

10:12.362 --> 10:14.989
but, also, it's authentic
and candid sharing.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.033
I'm so proud of this group.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.493
[laughing]

10:18.535 --> 10:19.786
Great job, Ashley.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.579
- Yeah, I like this.
This was good.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.081
We ate, we drank.
We talked about cum.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.082
- There was merriment.
- I mean, this was--

10:24.124 --> 10:25.125
- Booty hole.
- Okay, not--

10:25.166 --> 10:26.501
- It made everybody
really happy.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.460
- No, just Robyn.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.795
[laughing]

10:28.837 --> 10:30.422
- That's why Robyn's teeth
are so white.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.965
[laughing]

10:32.007 --> 10:33.675
- I'm gonna say it again.
Like, I'm so grateful

10:33.717 --> 10:36.052
you guys called me at,
like, the perfect time

10:36.094 --> 10:38.304
because I was
really feeling down.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.682
Um, I've been trying to conceive
for the past several months.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.517
- Oh.
- I know,

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
and we haven't
been successful.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.979
- I'm sorry.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.522
- So, I'm just hoping
that, like, being stress-free

10:47.564 --> 10:48.898
get these babies poppin'.
- Yes.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.025
How many do you want?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.359
- I would love twins,
a boy and a girl,

10:51.401 --> 10:53.069
and-and call it a day.
- Mm-hmm, and be done.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.362
- Yeah.
- I want to do that.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.990
I want to get pregnant,
a boy and a girl.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.408
- If I can get a twin
boy and a girl set, I'm done.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.826
- Yeah, you're done.
Same.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.578
- Take me to the, uh, BPO room
and get my body back.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.121
- Right. Yeah, exactly.
- Yes.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.372
- Oh, my God.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.207
- So, yeah, why don't we
go back to the hotel?

11:06.249 --> 11:07.250
- Yes, yes, yes.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.626
- Everyone can come
back to my room.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.627
- Yeah, let's go back.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.378
- Everyone-everyone
is invited.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.629
- Alrighty.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.548
- Oh, I gotta put all
my sex toys away, y'all.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.466
- Girl.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.467
- All right. We ready?
- Yes.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.886
- Time to go.
[laughing]

11:17.927 --> 11:19.179
- All right.
Thank you, everyone.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.680
- Okay, yeah, get your
big ass in the back.

11:20.722 --> 11:21.806
[laughing]

11:24.768 --> 11:27.062
- No, no, no.
You have to get out!

11:27.103 --> 11:35.820
**

11:35.862 --> 11:37.781
[whooping]

11:37.822 --> 11:40.867
- Party-party-party!

11:40.909 --> 11:44.913
- Don't get me kicked out.
- Oh, wow!

11:44.954 --> 11:50.752
- You got a piano, Robyn.
Not the piano.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.921
- Who can play the piano?
[clears throat]

11:52.962 --> 11:54.714
- It better be more than
"Twinkle, Twinkle."

11:54.756 --> 11:57.092
- Oh, no.
* Some people *

11:57.133 --> 11:58.927
Somebody get her off the piano.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.096
I am so leaving.
Somebody gonna call complaining.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.347
- It's too much.
- All right.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.015
Well, Robyn, I love you.
- It's been real, Robyn.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.433
- It's been real.
- This is amazing.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.060
- See you tomorrow, okay?

12:07.102 --> 12:07.894
- Did you get
your rice pudding?

12:07.936 --> 12:09.270
- Oh, yeah, at home.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.481
- You're going to bed?
What?

12:11.523 --> 12:12.816
- All right.
Ashley, text us

12:12.857 --> 12:14.067
and let us know
what time to be ready tomorrow.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.735
- I definitely will.
- I need some slippers.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.278
Whose shoes are
these green shoes?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.655
- Good night.
- Can I wear them?

12:18.697 --> 12:21.157
- Yeah.
- Whose shoes are you wearing?

12:21.199 --> 12:25.954
- Um, hers.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.248
- It was literally
just weeks ago

12:28.289 --> 12:31.751
Candiace chose to
bash me online.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.795
- First word or phrase--
Robyn Dixon.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.130
- Fraud.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.966
- And now, she's in my room,
wearing my slippers,

12:38.008 --> 12:41.761
and acting like
nothing ever happened.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.096
I'm confused as sh--.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.598
- This is almost a group.
- Let out delegation.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.145
- When we hang out after hours--
- It's a let out delegation.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.771
[laughing]

12:51.813 --> 12:53.523
- That's it.
We all have a sign.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.066
Ashley?
Ashley?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.652
- We need a call.
What's our call?

12:57.694 --> 13:01.406
- Su-su!
[laughing]

13:01.448 --> 13:04.576
- Your call is gonna be
the sound of swallowing.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.827
- That's-- Robyn.

13:05.869 --> 13:10.874
[gulping]
[laughing]

13:10.915 --> 13:12.417
- I'm telling you.
Go home and swallow.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.501
- Okay.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.753
- I'm not doing it,
absolutely not.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.712
- And he's going to be
the happiest man ever.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.005
- Good night.
Yeah, good night.

13:17.047 --> 13:17.797
- I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing that, ever.

13:17.839 --> 13:18.882
- I'm okay.
All right.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.300
I'll see y'all.
- It doesn't digest.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.595
- Call me if you need me.
- Candiace, you will swallow.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.721
- Okay, so--

13:24.763 --> 13:26.097
- We should bring her
onto the side.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.515
Get-- tell her it's great.
- I know, but it's just--

13:27.557 --> 13:28.933
- Girl, your skin
is gonna be so clear.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.144
[laughing]
It's a good life.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.021
- Yeah.
- Okay, I could get behind that.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.814
- He's going to be
thanking us one day.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.358
- All right.
Well, I have to pee.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.359
I'm gonna go to bed.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.820
Um, I would like
to talk tomorrow.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.572
- Hmm. Okay.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.866
- It's time.
- Okay.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.327
- Robyn has always been
like a big sister to me,

13:47.369 --> 13:51.498
and being in this space
where we're able to have fun

13:51.539 --> 13:54.542
definitely reminds me of
where we used to be.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.544
So, bitch,
we need to talk.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.879
All right.
Good night.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.048
Thank you for the slippers.
I'll bring 'em back.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.049
- Drink that champagne.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.384
Otherwise,
if I come back tomorrow,

14:02.425 --> 14:03.718
and it's still there--
- No, it's gone. I got it.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.761
- I will just drink it.

14:04.803 --> 14:05.387
I'm not gonna
do anything to you.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.055
[laughing]

14:07.097 --> 14:08.390
- All right. Good night.
- All right, my darling.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.934
- All right.
- Happy throatings.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.310
- Coming up next...

14:12.352 --> 14:14.771
- Today's activity is meant
to be about reconnecting

14:14.813 --> 14:16.981
with your vagina.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.066
- What?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.652
- An intimate
personal experience.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.495
**

14:40.797 --> 14:42.799
- Hey, baby.
- Hello.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.760
- You look cute, babe.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.721
- I am cute.
[laughing]

14:50.015 --> 14:52.017
- I'm beautiful?
I'm a hot mess.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.186
- Oh, you're off
to work already.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.483
- Yeah, It's-- you know--

15:00.525 --> 15:02.360
It was so weird.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.280
This Wendy thing
keeps going on.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.823
She said I was
a crackhead.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.408
[laughing]

15:08.450 --> 15:09.951
I'm glad you find it funny.
- Oh, so now you're a--

15:09.993 --> 15:12.203
[laughing]
Oh, boy.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.168
- Okay, let's get
these activities.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.544
That's ready.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.048
My easels, okay, one,
two, three, four.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.425
- Knockity-knockity!
Ashley, what is up?

15:25.467 --> 15:26.259
- Come on!
Oh, sh--. Sh--.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.219
- Woot-woot!
- Welcome.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.680
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, look at this.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.140
- Yes.
- Yes, breakfast.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.975
- Wow!
- I know. It's quite a spread.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.393
- Okay.
- Badass French toast.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.811
- Yeah.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.063
- You know I like me
a little Frenchie-French toast.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.314
- We literally--
- And you like a fat ass, too.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.858
- Yeah, well,
I don't have that these days.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.194
Jason has no ass.
- He's a model.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.029
- I know. It's fine.
- It gets the job done.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.447
- He makes it up
in other areas.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.948
[laughing]
- Yes, we've heard.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.533
I've heard multiple times.

15:50.575 --> 15:54.537
- Okay, so, y'all's
room is the best.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.289
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's really nice.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.832
We went last night.
- Yeah.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.378
- Robyn, I straight up did not
wanna leave you last night.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.963
I was not being a good bestie.
[clears throat]

16:04.005 --> 16:05.799
I left you
in the room with people

16:05.840 --> 16:07.258
that have been
trashing you.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.344
- Trashing me.
Candiace, for sure,

16:09.386 --> 16:11.137
she's been trashing me
left and right, incessantly.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.222
- Yeah.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.682
- I found it odd
she came to your room.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.808
- Me, too.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.226
- She's over here
literally saying that

16:16.267 --> 16:18.144
I plotted on her husband
and, you know,

16:18.186 --> 16:19.521
calling me a fraud.
- Mm-hmm.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.399
- And saying whatever was
going on with Juan, like,

16:22.440 --> 16:24.275
was a cover up so that
we could talk about Chris,

16:24.317 --> 16:25.527
like, all of that sh--.
I'm like--

16:25.568 --> 16:26.653
- I don't know
how you let her in your room.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.988
That's funny to me.
- Hello, ladies.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.115
- How are you?
- Welcome, welcome.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.075
- Oh, wow.
- Thank you.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.243
- Oh, come and get it, girl.
What are we doing?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.703
- This is nice.
- Having a good ol' time.

16:34.744 --> 16:35.912
I'm glad you came in your robe.
- Oh, we're twinning.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.205
Yes, I am supportive.
- Oh, good morning.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.082
You brought your own robe.
- Good morn-ting.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.084
- Good morning, babe.
- Muah.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.921
- Ooh, what is this?
- Hi, ladies.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.297
- How are you?

16:48.133 --> 16:49.968
- I think this activity
is meant to be about

16:50.010 --> 16:51.928
reconnecting with
our femininity.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.179
- Oh.
- Because as women,

16:53.221 --> 16:54.431
you know,
a part of our identity

16:54.472 --> 16:56.433
is with our
reproductive organs.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.059
So, what I had planned
for us to do today--

16:58.101 --> 16:59.728
- We're gonna paint
our cootchie?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.980
- Yes.
- No.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.940
- Or your interpretation
of your vagina,

17:03.982 --> 17:06.401
if you don't
wanna be literal.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.445
- Not I.
- Ashley, what the (BLEEP)?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.488
- Okay, well, you've seen
each other's cootchies before.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.115
- I-I don't bother
my cootchie.

17:12.157 --> 17:13.742
- Why y'all acting
all bashful now?

17:13.783 --> 17:16.536
- Wendy showed you her vagina?
- It was like...

17:16.578 --> 17:18.663
- No.
- I looked, though.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.956
[laughing]

17:19.998 --> 17:21.666
- The idea was that
it would be a-an intimate,

17:21.708 --> 17:23.418
personal experience.
- What the...?

17:23.460 --> 17:25.045
- Well, you put a sheet
over yourself.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.379
- I look at my cootchie
all the time.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.797
- Me, too.
- It's pretty.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.008
- I'm not comfortable with it.
- You can draw a rose.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.217
You can--
it doesn't have to be literal.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.761
- Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, I can envision.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.304
- The exercise is meant to be
an interpretation.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.556
- If we're gonna be honest
about these paintings,

17:36.598 --> 17:38.558
it should be
some busted cootchies

17:38.600 --> 17:40.226
'cause they've been out here
in these streets

17:40.268 --> 17:42.312
doing concubine foolishness,

17:42.354 --> 17:45.190
and you should be painting
roast beef.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.691
- Okay, so--
- What-what am I doing?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.611
Oh.
- Just giving you your thing.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.654
- Now, what happened with--
I'm sorry.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.657
Listen, yesterday, Robyn,
Ashley wanted to make sure

17:54.699 --> 17:56.493
you had the second
penthouse room

17:56.534 --> 17:59.913
because she wanted to make sure
you were okay.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.415
And honestly, there's a whole
group of friends over here

18:02.457 --> 18:03.875
that don't know
what you're going through.

18:03.917 --> 18:07.295
I feel like, Robyn,
you selectively speak to

18:07.337 --> 18:10.256
one pocket of
the friendship circle, okay?

18:10.298 --> 18:11.675
- That's true.

18:11.716 --> 18:16.054
- Okay, in doing so,
you certainly divide the group.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.098
So, Robyn,
I'm asking you directly.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.599
How are you doing?
- So, I don't--

18:19.641 --> 18:23.061
um, first of all,
what I've experienced personally

18:23.103 --> 18:24.938
is not dividing the group.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.691
I speak to the people
who actually reach out to me

18:27.732 --> 18:30.193
and say, "I'm sorry
you're going through this.

18:30.235 --> 18:33.780
Are you okay?"
- Okay.

18:33.822 --> 18:39.744
- So, when I reached out to you,
and you ignored me--

18:39.786 --> 18:41.287
- Are you serious?
- I'm just, I mean, I just--

18:41.329 --> 18:42.622
I just want accuracy.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.249
- After-after you've trashed me
on social media

18:44.290 --> 18:46.543
incessantly, really?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.503
Do you know what
I've gone through?

18:48.545 --> 18:51.339
I have gone through
----ing torture!

18:51.381 --> 18:53.008
- Well, so-so have I.
[laughing]

18:53.049 --> 18:54.134
- But at my expense?
No.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.343
Actually, when you were
being tortured--

18:55.385 --> 18:56.344
- Robyn, listen.
Yes, Robyn, at your expense

18:56.386 --> 18:58.221
because of you
hiding your truth.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.889
- If I didn't tell my mama
what happened,

18:59.931 --> 19:02.058
why the (BLEEP) would I walk in
front of any of y'all?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.644
- Robyn, you need
to be accountable.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.812
- Well, what do
you wanna do?

19:05.854 --> 19:07.397
You wanna ----ing
beat me up or somethin'?

19:07.439 --> 19:08.606
What do you wanna do?
- Don't, Robyn.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.899
- Hold me accountable.
I'm here. I'm here.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.276
- No, I want you to
hold yourself accountable.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.277
- I'm here.
I'm here.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.695
Hold me accountable.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.822
- You lied the entire year,
but you asked all of us

19:15.864 --> 19:17.115
to be accountable.
- Hold me accountable.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.408
What do you want me do?
I do not.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.909
- You know what?

19:19.951 --> 19:22.829
This outfit reminds me of
those women in a polygamy camp,

19:22.871 --> 19:24.539
and they're gonna
stand up for their man.

19:24.581 --> 19:29.294
Only thing Robyn was missing
was her bonnet.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.921
"Juan is a good man.
You just don't know.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.381
Ask me, ask me!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.758
Ask me anything
about Juan."

19:34.799 --> 19:36.343
Girl, the whole world
know about Juan.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.596
We don't need to
ask you about Juan.

19:39.637 --> 19:43.183
Sit your ass down
and get a bonnet.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.518
Robyn, it's yours.
I'll save it for you.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.062
- Can we stop with this
because this is

19:47.103 --> 19:49.689
a very personal experience?
And you all are trying-

19:49.731 --> 19:51.858
- Which you drug us into.
- No, I did not.

19:51.900 --> 19:52.942
That you're trying to
make me a villain for.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.235
- I'm sorry.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.487
The minute you put a price
$5.99 on it, Robyn,

19:55.528 --> 19:56.654
and sold it to the world,
you drug us into it.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.739
- What does that
have to do with you?

19:57.781 --> 19:58.406
What does that have
to do with you?

19:59.157 --> 20:00.158
- I'm sorry.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.368
- What does that
have to do with you?

20:01.409 --> 20:02.786
- You betrayed us with
your accountability.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.871
- You compromised the integrity
of our entire group.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.289
- Can I ----ing talk?

20:06.331 --> 20:07.540
- You compromised the integrity
of our entire group.

20:07.582 --> 20:08.958
- I am happy to answer
all of your questions!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.460
- Okay, we're good.
- But when you're attacking me,

20:10.502 --> 20:12.045
like I did something to you,
that's when it's a problem!

20:12.087 --> 20:13.463
- I'm not trying to attack you.
- No one is attacking you.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.507
- How come we never saw you
going up your homegirl

20:15.548 --> 20:17.467
saying, "You know what?

20:17.509 --> 20:19.761
I've been really stressed
because this is going on."

20:19.803 --> 20:23.056
- Okay, I will address that.
This girl DMed me.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.474
I wasn't looking
in my messages.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.017
She messaged Gizelle.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.728
- And just because y'all did not
see or hear our discussions

20:28.770 --> 20:30.438
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.607
- Bullsh--.
- No, no.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.443
- I have a question.

20:35.485 --> 20:39.197
You said that there was
a DM exchange,

20:39.239 --> 20:41.491
and you didn't read it.
- I didn't.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.743
- But there's no part of you
that wants to know

20:43.785 --> 20:45.662
what they were saying
to each other

20:45.704 --> 20:48.206
that was potentially
inappropriate?

20:48.248 --> 20:49.749
- It-- no.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.335
Uh, Juan no longer had
the messages with her.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.087
Like, he cleans his phone out
like crazy.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.755
Like, he deletes
everything, okay?

20:55.797 --> 20:58.383
So, he did not have
the messages with her.

21:04.931 --> 21:09.227
**

21:14.107 --> 21:16.401
- There's no part of you
that wants to know

21:16.443 --> 21:18.278
what they were saying
to each other

21:18.319 --> 21:20.905
that was potentially
inappropriate?

21:20.947 --> 21:22.240
- It-- no.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.700
He cleans his phone
out like crazy.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.285
Like, he deletes everything.
So...

21:25.326 --> 21:27.287
- Oh, girl, no.
- It's for safety?

21:27.328 --> 21:28.455
- Like, literally,
he doesn't even

21:28.496 --> 21:29.789
store people's phones.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.166
He'll have coaches
reach out to him, and he's like,

21:31.207 --> 21:33.084
"I don't know who this is,"
'cause he's weird, okay?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.503
So, he did not have
the messages with her,

21:35.545 --> 21:38.548
and I don't communicate
with thirst buckets.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.843
- In Robyn's defense,
there is something called trust.

21:41.885 --> 21:43.762
So, if you are gonna
trust somebody,

21:43.803 --> 21:45.263
then you don't have to try
to verify

21:45.305 --> 21:46.598
everything that they're saying.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.725
But it wouldn't be me.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.185
I'd be looking
all up and through.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.896
- Okay, thank you, Robyn.
Uh, it seemed even--

21:52.937 --> 21:54.397
- You're welcome.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.523
And if y'all wanna hold me
to this fire all week, I'm good.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.484
- No, no one does.
- No, I'm good. No.

21:57.525 --> 21:58.777
- That-that was not
what this was about.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.986
- It's good.
- No. We gotta--

22:00.028 --> 22:01.488
we gotta get going
'cause this half the day.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.655
- Okay, wait a minute.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.032
- Robyn, I am glad we
had the discussion

22:04.074 --> 22:05.784
because, you know, the activity
that we had today,

22:05.825 --> 22:07.911
even though I think would
have been fun and nice,

22:07.952 --> 22:09.579
we're not doing
that now, okay?

22:09.621 --> 22:10.997
[laughing]
- Sorry.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.999
- So, yeah, y'all took up
the whole damn morning.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.335
So, now we're gonna
do two activities.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.045
We're either gonna
go to a distillery.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.254
- Okay.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.798
- Or we're gonna go
to a cowboy boot shop.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.924
We can't go as a whole group
'cause there are a lot of us.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.634
And then we're all
going to have lunch.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.426
So, everybody take
a thing out the hat.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.637
- Oh, God.

22:26.721 --> 22:30.225
- I'm putting it
in God's hands.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.394
Okay, here we go.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.604
All right, everybody.
What did we get?

22:34.646 --> 22:36.523
Y'all distillery?

22:36.564 --> 22:37.482
- Yeah, we're distillery.
- Distillery, distillery.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.025
- Yes.
- Boot shopping.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.110
- Boots!
- Boots!

22:40.151 --> 22:41.903
- I'm going to
the distillery, Robyn.

22:41.945 --> 22:42.946
**

22:42.987 --> 22:44.322
- Robyn's going to
the distillery?

22:44.364 --> 22:46.032
- I wouldn't wanna go
with these two grumpy asses.

22:46.074 --> 22:46.700
- Do you wanna switch?

22:46.741 --> 22:48.493
- No.
- No.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.536
- Those were not the rules.
All right, babes.

22:49.577 --> 22:50.495
We gotta go.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.788
We only have
about 20 minutes.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.997
So, we'll convene
in the lobby.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.541
- Yes.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.835
- Oh, my God.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.294
[sighs]

22:58.336 --> 23:07.846
**

23:07.887 --> 23:10.557
[humming]

23:13.935 --> 23:17.188
Okay. Whew.

23:17.230 --> 23:20.191
- I am good.
I'm good.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.485
I wanna talk about
the Pave conference call.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.071
- I have been with Pave
for many, many years.

23:25.113 --> 23:28.616
Pave is an organization
which empowers victims

23:28.658 --> 23:30.243
who have been raped.

23:30.285 --> 23:32.203
I am counted
in that number,

23:32.245 --> 23:36.374
nine out of ten who
do not report the rape,

23:36.416 --> 23:39.627
but today I am counted in
that number of the empowered.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.047
My job with Pave
is to sound the horn

23:42.088 --> 23:43.840
for those who have
been attacked.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.551
We are not victims.
We-we are victors.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.887
And as I approach
triple 20,

23:48.928 --> 23:50.889
this Pave event means
the world to me

23:50.930 --> 23:52.891
because I'm continuing
that march.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.769
- Taking the power back.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.815
- What is taking so long?
When are we leaving?

24:00.857 --> 24:02.859
These hos are always late.

24:02.901 --> 24:05.987
**

24:06.029 --> 24:08.323
- Hi. How are you?
- Team boots.

24:08.365 --> 24:09.699
- Yes.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.786
- You okay?
Did you trip?

24:12.827 --> 24:14.245
[laughing]
- Yes, girl.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.622
- Do you need help?

24:15.663 --> 24:16.706
I can help you down the steps,
if you need it.

24:16.748 --> 24:19.584
- Hey, Karen, tennis babe.
- Come on.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.919
- Hi. How is going?
- Okay.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.420
- Hey, hey.
- It's happening.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.838
- Oh, we're going
real western.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.674
Hey, hey, Robyna.
- Boots-- pair of boots.

24:25.715 --> 24:26.841
- Yes.
- Y'all ready?

24:26.883 --> 24:28.134
- Okay.
- Let's go.

24:28.176 --> 24:29.260
- Let's hit the road.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.680
The Lincoln is going
to the distillery.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.640
- So, we're in this car.
- Who else is with us?

24:33.682 --> 24:35.266
- Uh, Robyn.
- Robyn?

24:35.308 --> 24:37.477
- Okay, Jesus.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.770
- Are you okay,
Robyn, from today?

24:38.812 --> 24:40.772
- It's just nonsense.
- That's a lot.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.274
- People act like
I did something to them.

24:43.316 --> 24:44.609
Like, no.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.902
If someone comes to you
with private information,

24:45.944 --> 24:47.946
and you keep it private.
- Girl, yeah.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.781
- Like, who--
- Ain't nobody in this group

24:49.823 --> 24:51.324
gonna be like, "Hey, guys,
here's all my dirty laundry."

24:51.366 --> 24:53.618
- Right, right.
- Yes.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.661
- Do you feel like
you've gotten everything

24:54.703 --> 24:56.121
you needed from Robyn?

24:56.162 --> 24:58.790
- I think I've gotten
everything that Robyn can give.

24:58.832 --> 25:00.166
- Hmm.
- But at the same time,

25:00.208 --> 25:03.503
I heard in Robyn's voice
the way she loves that man.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.088
- Mm-hmm.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.214
She does love him.
- She loves him.

25:06.256 --> 25:08.800
- No, their situation
is complicated.

25:08.842 --> 25:10.051
- Okay.
- I don't care.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.845
- What?
- I don't care.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.096
- All right.
- Like, I feel like,

25:13.138 --> 25:14.639
if you wanna be with him,
if he cheats on you,

25:14.681 --> 25:15.974
if he goes to Canada,
if he goes to Nigeria,

25:16.016 --> 25:20.145
I don't care.
- Ooh, okay.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.856
- Okay, I think
we're here.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.899
Tecovas Boots, y'all.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.985
- Okay, y'all.
- Y'all.

25:27.027 --> 25:29.904
[laughing]

25:31.489 --> 25:32.782
Oh, I love that smell.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.159
- Hi, y'all. Welcome in.
- Hi.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.243
- Hello.
- How are you doing today?

25:35.285 --> 25:36.661
- Good.
- Very good.

25:36.703 --> 25:37.829
- It smells like
leather in here.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.456
- Leather, yes.
- It's genuine,

25:39.497 --> 25:40.665
like a fresh new cow
got killed.

25:40.707 --> 25:41.958
- Yeah. We got, um,
drinks at the bar,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.793
all complimentary.
- Oh, cool.

25:43.835 --> 25:44.836
- Okay.
- Start with some drinks.

25:44.878 --> 25:45.503
I think that's
always a good idea.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.463
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.839
- M'kay.
- Start with the cockies.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.091
- Let's partake and shop.
- Sip and shop, baby.

25:50.133 --> 25:53.636
**

25:53.678 --> 25:56.473
- Distillery time.
- We at the distillery.

25:56.514 --> 26:00.769
- Beer time-- oh, my God,
this is like the beer garden.

26:00.810 --> 26:04.189
- Whiskey.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.482
- How are you ladies doing?
- How are you?

26:05.523 --> 26:06.608
- I'm doing wonderful.
Take a quick look around.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.400
- Okay.
- I can show you a little bit

26:07.442 --> 26:08.276
about the distillery.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.319
- Love.
- Good.

26:09.361 --> 26:10.487
- And then if you guys
would like,

26:10.528 --> 26:11.571
we can offer you
a couple of tastes through

26:11.613 --> 26:13.073
a couple of the products
that we make?

26:13.114 --> 26:14.074
- We must taste.
- We make a couple
of types of whiskey

26:14.115 --> 26:14.908
and a really
wonderful gin, too.

26:14.949 --> 26:15.909
- Ooh.
- Oh, not whiskey.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.327
I see beer.
- Yes.

26:17.369 --> 26:19.954
[laughing]

26:21.790 --> 26:22.749
- We don't have
any wines, unfortunately.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.459
- Oh, God, I'm not
drinking liquor.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.712
- We're just a distillery,
so we just make the whiskey

26:27.754 --> 26:29.214
and the gin.
- Okay.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.382
- You guys wanna take
a quick look around?

26:30.423 --> 26:31.466
- Yes.
- Yes.

26:31.508 --> 26:32.884
- Okay, love it.
- Follow me this way.

26:32.926 --> 26:34.177
- Okay, and all this
is beer.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.555
- Now, that's whiskey.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.140
If you guys want, I can actually
kind of show you a little bit.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.810
We should have some
coming out right here.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.103
- Wow.
- Oh, stop it.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.729
- Can we taste it?
- Here, allow me.

26:44.771 --> 26:45.980
- Just a little bit.
- Yes.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.482
- It's very high proof,
right now, so, yeah,

26:47.524 --> 26:48.483
you only want just a little bit.
- Yeah, just a little bit.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.901
- What proof would
you say this is?

26:49.943 --> 26:51.569
- Two hundred.
- It's about 150 proof.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.321
- What?
- God darn.

26:53.363 --> 26:54.781
- I'm gonna be drunk.
- A hundred and fifty proof?

26:54.823 --> 26:56.116
- Cheers. Yes.
- Cheers to Austin!

26:56.157 --> 26:57.200
- Y'all-y'all are about to
grow hair on your chest.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.368
- Would you like some?
- No, thank you.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.536
- Cheers to Austin.
- Cheers to Austin.

26:59.577 --> 27:00.620
- You're gonna grow
hair on your chest.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.830
- Cheers to Austin.
- Come on, Karen.

27:01.871 --> 27:02.914
- No.
- All right,

27:02.956 --> 27:04.040
we're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.083
- Safety first.
I got you. I got you.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.753
- God damn!
- All right.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.046
- Ahh!

27:10.088 --> 27:12.590
Oh, my God.
- Ahh! Ahh!

27:12.632 --> 27:13.550
[laughing]
- My tongue is numb.

27:13.591 --> 27:14.843
- Ahh.

27:14.884 --> 27:15.760
- Oh, which one
are you trying on?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.095
- The rodeo boot.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.304
Giddy up!
- I'm ready.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.889
I'm ready for, like,
a little barn dancing.

27:19.931 --> 27:22.600
- Okay, Robyn, yes.
- Do you like?

27:22.642 --> 27:23.977
Yeah, they're cute.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.186
- You feel like
a real cowgirl?

27:25.228 --> 27:28.314
**

27:28.356 --> 27:29.733
- I feel like I'm ready
to walk right outta here

27:29.774 --> 27:31.484
with these shoes.
[laughing]

27:34.154 --> 27:37.157
- Everything else--
- And this ring is stunning.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.450
- Thank you.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.617
- And so, you guys have
been married how long?

27:39.659 --> 27:41.161
- And year and a half.
- Oh, just a year.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.121
- It was chaos
'cause I'm trying to plan

27:43.163 --> 27:45.165
this wedding from L.A.,
and I moved to the DMV area

27:45.206 --> 27:46.958
one week before our wedding.
- Yeah.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.127
- And I didn't really
come back here enough,

27:49.169 --> 27:51.588
which is why I'm, like, really
disappointed in my wedding.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.506
- Oh, really?
- And, like, nothing-nothing
went as planned.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.759
My decor-- horrendous.
My outfits were horrendous.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.052
Like, everything
was a mess.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.595
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

27:58.636 --> 27:59.512
I was really upset.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.180
- So, you need
a do-over maybe.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.639
- I do.

28:01.681 --> 28:02.932
So, we haven't done our
Nigerian traditional wedding,

28:02.974 --> 28:04.392
so we're gonna do that.
- Oh, okay.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.102
- You know, when we
first got married,

28:06.144 --> 28:08.104
we agreed that we wanted to have
our Nigerian traditional wedding

28:08.146 --> 28:10.023
after we expand our family.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.942
But, honestly, that's something
I wanna really enjoy

28:12.984 --> 28:14.194
all the festivities.

28:14.235 --> 28:16.237
I wanna wear all
the beautiful dresses,

28:16.279 --> 28:19.032
which are normally, like,
corsets glued to your body.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.283
You can't breathe,
can barely walk.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.576
Like, that's not gonna
work if I'm pregnant.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.495
- Nneka, first of all,
I'm so glad you're here.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.039
Hopefully, we don't, you know,
scare you away or whatever.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.999
I now you've had to--
- Like, have we a little bit?

28:28.041 --> 28:30.168
- No.I like you ladies.
- Okay.

28:30.210 --> 28:33.672
- But even with, like, how-how
they were talking to me today,

28:33.713 --> 28:35.674
like, that's not something
that you normally would,

28:35.715 --> 28:38.885
like, how you would, like,
normally talk to a friend.

28:38.927 --> 28:41.179
- I don't know why there was
such a heated issue.

28:41.221 --> 28:42.472
- Right.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.556
- You know, I feel like
you've been transparent,

28:43.598 --> 28:44.391
even with me,
and I'm just meeting you

28:44.432 --> 28:45.475
the past couple
of weeks.

28:45.517 --> 28:46.893
- Yeah.
- You've been an open book.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.687
- Yeah.
- I-I feel like they
made it about them.

28:48.728 --> 28:49.896
- Right.
- It was.

28:49.938 --> 28:53.233
Like, that, for me, is,
like, disgusting.

28:53.274 --> 28:55.860
- This is somethin' else,
right here.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.821
Well, welcome to Austin.
- Yes. Cheers.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.364
- Well, cheers, ladies.
- Cheers.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.032
- Cheers, guys.
- I know you can't.

29:01.074 --> 29:03.201
- Yeah, water for me,
you guys,

29:03.243 --> 29:04.828
'cause I'm not
drinking liquor.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.996
**

29:07.038 --> 29:09.916
- Girl, whew, ooh.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.876
[cawing]

29:11.918 --> 29:13.712
- Y'all know
my history of birds.

29:13.753 --> 29:14.504
- Oh, no.
- I don't like birds.

29:14.546 --> 29:15.547
- Y'all better--
- Okay.

29:15.588 --> 29:18.299
[screaming]

29:20.051 --> 29:22.220
- That's not
your mama, is it?

29:24.597 --> 29:26.766
- Don't do that.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.935
[cawing]

29:40.321 --> 29:42.949
[cawing]

29:42.991 --> 29:46.327
- That's not your mama,
is it?

29:47.662 --> 29:48.872
- Don't do that.

29:48.913 --> 29:49.914
[laughing]
- Mia, you--

29:49.956 --> 29:50.915
- No, that's not even funny.
- Mia.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.584
- So, like, let's not.
Uh-uh.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.712
- Girl.
- Hmm, yeah, no,

29:55.754 --> 29:57.464
let's not do that.
Let's leave the moms out of it.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.007
Thank you so much.
- Oh, thank you.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.550
- Thank you.

30:00.592 --> 30:02.260
- But can we clear that up?
- There's nothing to clear up.

30:02.302 --> 30:04.637
- Did you say that your mama
did not send names

30:04.679 --> 30:06.765
to the shrine?
- I don't need to defend this

30:06.806 --> 30:08.141
because I never
thought I should,

30:08.183 --> 30:10.352
but when you guys are
saying, "Shrine"--

30:10.393 --> 30:12.479
- Mm-hmm.
- You're saying it in a way

30:12.520 --> 30:14.314
in which leaves it
up to the imagination

30:14.356 --> 30:15.231
for what it is.
- Oh.

30:15.273 --> 30:17.567
- Catholics have shrine.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.862
Our saints have
different shrines,

30:20.904 --> 30:22.238
and it's not
something negative

30:22.280 --> 30:23.573
because what we do
know for a fact--

30:23.615 --> 30:25.492
- So, you do use a shrine.
- No, I didn't say that.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.077
- Uh-huh.
- Catholicism uses a shrine.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.411
- Okay.
- I did not know that.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.330
- Yeah, I didn't either.
- I did not know that,

30:30.372 --> 30:31.664
and that's enlightening.
- 'Cause when someone says

30:31.706 --> 30:32.999
someone is sending people's
names to the shrine,

30:33.041 --> 30:34.501
I'm like don't send mine.
- Well, it was said

30:34.542 --> 30:37.295
in that manner that
it would cast that doubt.

30:37.337 --> 30:39.339
- There you go,
and it was shrouded in,

30:39.381 --> 30:40.924
people started
saying witchcraft,

30:40.965 --> 30:43.218
and we're talking
Nigerians and Africans.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.427
- Yes.
- And honestly,

30:44.469 --> 30:47.305
as someone who grew up
being misunderstood

30:47.347 --> 30:49.766
because I was Nigerian,
this conversation

30:49.808 --> 30:51.393
has been
very triggering for me.

30:51.434 --> 30:55.021
Um, I thank God that I was
raised by a woman of Christ.

30:55.063 --> 30:59.025
And just to hear her be
maligned in this way,

30:59.067 --> 30:59.943
it's like--
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

30:59.984 --> 31:00.652
- That's your mama.
- Yeah.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.070
- It hurts.

31:02.112 --> 31:06.157
- Um, yeah.

31:06.199 --> 31:08.284
When you're raised by
a single mom

31:08.326 --> 31:11.996
who literally sacrificed
her life for you

31:12.038 --> 31:13.623
and gave up her life,

31:13.665 --> 31:16.501
so you can be good,
you're not gonna sit there

31:16.543 --> 31:20.088
and be friends with someone
who attacks her.

31:20.130 --> 31:22.757
And so, I don't play
about my mom.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.384
- You know, Wendy, I know
we had our differences,

31:24.426 --> 31:26.553
but I really do want
what's best for you,

31:26.594 --> 31:29.305
and that seems like it's a--
that's a real sensitive topic.

31:29.347 --> 31:30.890
So, I'm gonna
leave it alone.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.267
- Mm-hmm.
- From this day on.

31:32.308 --> 31:33.560
- That's my mama.
- Yes.

31:33.601 --> 31:35.228
- Okay, that is your mama.
- Nobody--

31:35.270 --> 31:36.563
don't mess with my mama.
- Yeah.

31:36.604 --> 31:37.647
- And you only get one.
- And you only get one.

31:37.689 --> 31:38.481
- And you don't
have to explain it.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.442
- Yes, you don't.
- Yeah.

31:40.483 --> 31:43.069
- Well, y'all ready?
- Yes, I am.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.321
- Let's do it.
[cawing]

31:46.072 --> 31:47.615
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

31:47.657 --> 31:48.908
- Yeah, let's hit it.
- All right. Wait a minute.

31:48.950 --> 31:50.243
Did you-- okay, we're
all purchased. Where is--

31:50.285 --> 31:51.453
did you buy anything?
- Come on, cowgirls. Nah.

31:51.494 --> 31:52.746
- Oh, you didn't. Okay.
- Nah.

31:52.787 --> 31:53.455
- Okay.
- Be careful.

31:53.496 --> 31:54.330
- Oh.
- You okay?

31:54.372 --> 31:55.915
[laughing]
- Always, always.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.167
- All right.
- Bye.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.419
- These boots were
made for walking.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.171
- Your boots are
made for falling.

32:01.212 --> 32:02.380
- I know, right?
[laughing]

32:02.422 --> 32:03.506
- We're going
to have lunch now.

32:03.548 --> 32:04.424
- Oh, we are?
- Yay, lunchtime.

32:04.466 --> 32:05.800
- Okay.

32:05.842 --> 32:06.760
Is this it, right here?
- We should get something.

32:06.801 --> 32:07.927
- Right?
- Yeah.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.387
**

32:09.429 --> 32:11.014
All right, cute.
- So cute.

32:11.056 --> 32:12.515
- So cute. Oh,
this is so cute. Hi.

32:12.557 --> 32:14.017
- Hi.
- Um, eight of us, please.

32:14.059 --> 32:15.435
- Oh, this is nice.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.771
- I can take y'all
right over here, if y'all want.

32:17.812 --> 32:19.481
- Oh, we're sitting here?

32:19.522 --> 32:20.440
Okay.

32:20.482 --> 32:21.524
- We've come to
the right place.

32:21.566 --> 32:22.942
- What?
- Corona Lights on the menu.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.486
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.576
- Whoo, it's a party.

32:31.618 --> 32:34.329
- I almost fell.
Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

32:34.371 --> 32:37.123
- Hi.
- Hi, ladies.

32:37.165 --> 32:40.377
- We've made it.
- Hello, hello.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.836
[overlapping chatter]
- How are you guys?

32:41.878 --> 32:42.754
Did you have fun?

32:42.796 --> 32:43.713
- Yes.
- Yes.

32:43.755 --> 32:45.131
- You had a good time?
- We did.

32:45.173 --> 32:46.257
- Where are we sitting?
- Good.

32:46.299 --> 32:48.176
- I didn't get any
distilled anything.

32:48.218 --> 32:49.636
- Snap, okay.

32:49.678 --> 32:50.637
- Are we ready to go ahead
and place some drink orders

32:50.679 --> 32:51.680
over here?

32:51.721 --> 32:55.141
- I would love to
try the mangonada?

32:55.183 --> 32:57.477
Can I also do the churros?

32:57.519 --> 33:00.438
- I will have Azul
on the rocks, um,

33:00.480 --> 33:03.024
and then also
The Big Crispy.

33:03.066 --> 33:04.109
- From the bar?
- I'm gonna do a Corona.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.902
- Corona.
- Oh, okay, Karen.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.028
- Yes, we didn't
get a beer.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.488
I thought I was
going to a brewery.

33:08.530 --> 33:10.824
- Can I do a white wine?
- White wine.

33:10.865 --> 33:14.035
- Can I have
the Abre Los Ojos shot, please?

33:14.077 --> 33:15.412
- I want a shot
of Azul, too.

33:15.453 --> 33:17.163
- I'm gonna follow Robyn's lead.
- Yep.

33:17.205 --> 33:19.124
- All right, guys.
I'm gonna go put this in.

33:19.165 --> 33:20.166
- Thank you.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.459
- How was your
shopping trip?

33:21.501 --> 33:24.212
- It was good.
- We learned more about Nneka.

33:24.254 --> 33:26.506
- Oh, Nneka? Do share.

33:26.548 --> 33:27.674
- We learned more
about her wedding.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.342
- Um, yeah. So, my wedding
at the Watergate

33:29.384 --> 33:30.927
was a disaster,
but I'm okay,

33:30.969 --> 33:32.387
'cause I'm looking forward
to my traditional wedding

33:32.429 --> 33:33.847
in Nigeria,
and I'm doing that.

33:33.888 --> 33:36.683
It's so important to me, like,
being on my father's land

33:36.725 --> 33:39.519
and getting married
at my compound

33:39.561 --> 33:41.021
in the village like
it's traditionally done.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.230
- Yeah.
- Oh.

33:42.272 --> 33:43.565
- So, my husband being
as a titled man,

33:43.606 --> 33:46.192
and he feels really compelled
to do it, too.

33:46.234 --> 33:47.736
- What does that mean?
Titled?

33:47.777 --> 33:49.404
- Um, kind of like a chief,
in a sense.

33:49.446 --> 33:50.655
- Oh.
- Oh, okay, okay.

33:50.697 --> 33:52.532
- It's like a special title.
You can get it,

33:52.574 --> 33:55.201
um, some people pay
for it nowadays.

33:55.243 --> 33:56.953
- Oh.
- But he didn't.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.371
- Oh, that's weird.
- I know.

33:58.413 --> 34:00.373
- He-he-- it's like
a blue check.

34:00.415 --> 34:02.042
So, it's important to him
that we do it

34:02.083 --> 34:03.793
according to culture,
as well.

34:03.835 --> 34:05.003
- Okay.

34:05.045 --> 34:06.379
- Now, what is this
buying titles, though?

34:06.421 --> 34:08.381
- You know how
you and Mia

34:08.423 --> 34:09.591
bought your blue checks
on Twitter?

34:09.632 --> 34:11.259
- Wait a minute. Wait.
I did not buy mine.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.510
- I did.
- Yeah.

34:12.552 --> 34:13.970
- Yes, you did.
- Your blue check.

34:14.012 --> 34:15.555
- Girl, you know, wait a minute.
- You-you bought yours.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.557
- Hold up.
- You and Mia are the only two

34:17.599 --> 34:19.476
that still have
a blue check.

34:19.517 --> 34:21.019
- Maybe they like me,
and they don't like you.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.562
- That's not how it works.

34:22.604 --> 34:23.730
- Let me just tell you this,
though.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.815
It tells you
how it was acquired.

34:25.857 --> 34:27.400
- Uh-huh. Just like that.
- All right, Wendy.

34:27.442 --> 34:28.693
What are you
talking about now?

34:28.735 --> 34:30.028
- Okay, look, Karen.
You see your check?

34:30.070 --> 34:32.322
- Okay, that does not mean that.
Verified account--

34:32.364 --> 34:33.573
this account is verified

34:33.615 --> 34:36.242
because they are subscribed
to Twitter Blue."

34:36.284 --> 34:37.243
- Blue,
you subscribed.

34:37.285 --> 34:38.286
That means you
paid for it.

34:38.328 --> 34:39.287
- I did not pay for this!

34:39.329 --> 34:40.914
- That's how it works.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.415
- I am innocent.

34:42.457 --> 34:44.292
I would have never paid
for a blue check.

34:44.334 --> 34:47.295
[gasps]
Oh, my God,

34:47.337 --> 34:49.297
it's on my Apple Pay.
[laughing]

34:49.339 --> 34:52.425
- Oh, you did.
- You did that, Karen.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.302
- I did not do--
I did not do this.

34:54.344 --> 34:56.930
I did not. I am innocent.
I am innocent.

34:56.971 --> 34:57.681
- Are you?

34:57.722 --> 34:59.099
- Undelete-- Oh!
- Oh!

34:59.140 --> 35:00.600
[screaming]
[laughing]

35:00.642 --> 35:03.395
- Tell us! Tell us!
- $11.

35:03.436 --> 35:06.523
- She paid $11 a month.
[laughing]

35:06.564 --> 35:08.024
- Give me back my--
delete it, delete it.

35:08.066 --> 35:10.026
- She's paying a month.
She's paying monthly, y'all.

35:10.068 --> 35:11.611
- Father God, in the name of
Jesus, I didn't do it.

35:11.653 --> 35:12.946
- Yes, you did.
- I'm innocent.

35:12.987 --> 35:15.323
- So, how did your credit card
get in the system?

35:15.365 --> 35:16.282
- Apple Pay did it.

35:16.324 --> 35:18.118
I am going to
call Apple Pay.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.035
We're gonna have
a conversation.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.412
- Mm-hmm.

35:20.453 --> 35:21.955
- I'm innocent.

35:21.996 --> 35:23.540
- All right, babes.
So, after we finish up,

35:23.581 --> 35:26.251
we're gonna go do
chickensh-- bingo.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.211
- Wait a minute.

35:28.253 --> 35:31.297
- This is an iconic
tradition in Austin.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.716
So, let's experience it.
- Okay.

35:32.757 --> 35:34.175
- Is there
a real chicken there?

35:34.217 --> 35:36.094
I can't be around chickens.
- Well, everything is--

35:36.136 --> 35:37.220
[laughing]
- It's not. It's not.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.972
- I can't. I-I can't be
around chickens.

35:39.014 --> 35:41.891
Bleh, dirty bird.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.476
I don't eat dirty bird.

35:43.518 --> 35:45.812
I don't wanna go near
dirty bird.

35:45.854 --> 35:47.647
I don't know where
Ashley gets this from.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.649
This divorce is taking her
through it. I'll tell you that.

35:49.691 --> 35:52.444
She's very creative--
vagina, chickensh-- bingo.

35:52.485 --> 35:54.029
I'm trying to be there
for the girl,

35:54.070 --> 35:55.155
but this is
a bit much.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.865
- It's not chicken, Karen.

35:56.906 --> 35:58.450
You just have to do
the chicken bingo.

35:58.491 --> 35:59.784
- Chickensh-- bingo, yes!

35:59.826 --> 36:01.453
- Long as there are no
live chickens, we're good.

36:01.494 --> 36:02.704
- Oh, we're gonna
change, right?

36:02.746 --> 36:03.747
- Probably need to change.
I mean...

36:03.788 --> 36:04.831
- Yeah, let's change.
- Yes.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.875
We're trying to get
you a man, honey.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.543
- Yeah.

36:08.585 --> 36:11.379
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.

36:11.421 --> 36:13.340
- Okay.

36:13.381 --> 36:14.966
You are still getting
a divorce, right?

36:15.008 --> 36:16.843
- Yes, still-still on track.
- Should we be

36:16.885 --> 36:19.054
celebrating that, like,
on this trip?

36:19.095 --> 36:20.221
- No, no, I'll
tell you when.

36:20.263 --> 36:21.389
Still logistics
to work out.

36:21.431 --> 36:22.515
- Really?

36:22.557 --> 36:24.726
- Yeah, what custody
should look like.

36:24.768 --> 36:25.894
- What are you
leaning towards?

36:25.935 --> 36:26.978
- In a perfect world,

36:27.020 --> 36:28.355
I would have the kids
during the week,

36:28.396 --> 36:29.564
and he'd have them
every other weekend.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.483
- Every other weekend?
Really?

36:31.524 --> 36:32.734
Not every weekend?
- That's it?

36:32.776 --> 36:34.361
- Mmm.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.612
- Yeah, I can't imagine
seven days

36:35.653 --> 36:37.197
without my children.
- Yeah.

36:37.238 --> 36:38.865
- He wants more time,
obviously.

36:38.907 --> 36:41.117
- Has she even
filed for divorce?

36:41.159 --> 36:42.535
Do we even know?

36:42.577 --> 36:45.538
I understand
this is a man

36:45.580 --> 36:47.624
who plucked her up
off the curb

36:47.665 --> 36:50.543
and put her in the condo
in the sky,

36:50.585 --> 36:53.755
but, also, bitch,
put your Nikes on and run.

36:53.797 --> 36:54.964
Like, what are
you doing?

36:55.006 --> 36:59.427
- So, is-- what's
going on with, um--

36:59.469 --> 37:00.720
speaking of Michael,

37:00.762 --> 37:03.682
what's going on
with the lawsuit?

37:07.018 --> 37:08.395
Candiace?

37:08.436 --> 37:11.064
- Oh, I didn't hear you.
- Michael Darby is suing you.

37:11.106 --> 37:12.399
- What about it?

37:12.440 --> 37:13.733
- Is he suing you?

37:13.775 --> 37:16.361
- I'm not speaking about that
in this group.

37:16.403 --> 37:19.072
- So, can we get
a list of, like,

37:19.114 --> 37:20.281
what we can talk about

37:20.323 --> 37:21.574
and what we're not
supposed to talk about?

37:21.616 --> 37:22.659
- No.
- No.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.453
- Like, do you wanna--

37:25.495 --> 37:26.621
- Excuse me?

37:26.663 --> 37:29.082
- We can be dense
a different day.

37:29.124 --> 37:30.125
I'm not--
- We can be dense?

37:39.884 --> 37:40.135
**

37:41.219 --> 37:43.763
- Candiace, Michael Darby
is suing you.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.807
- I'm not speaking
about that.

37:45.849 --> 37:46.850
- Can we get
a list of, like,

37:46.891 --> 37:48.059
what we're supposed
to talk about

37:48.101 --> 37:49.561
and what we're not
supposed to talk about?

37:49.602 --> 37:51.062
- No.
- No.

37:51.104 --> 37:53.898
- Like, do you wanna--

37:53.940 --> 37:55.358
Excuse me? Being dense?
I don't--

37:55.400 --> 37:57.819
- Robyn, you're not dumb.
- No, I'm-I'm not being dumb.

37:59.195 --> 38:01.948
- Which, I mean, you, I think--
you kind of went against that

38:01.990 --> 38:04.492
when you spoke about your
husband's legal matter.

38:04.534 --> 38:05.952
- Juan has been
in the news, lately,

38:05.994 --> 38:07.954
because a player
came to him to report

38:07.996 --> 38:11.499
being sexually harassed,
and he failed to report it.

38:11.541 --> 38:13.585
- I wanna be careful
because it's a lawsuit

38:13.626 --> 38:14.753
and all of that,

38:14.794 --> 38:17.213
but I know that
he handled the situation

38:17.255 --> 38:21.968
exactly the way I would want
somebody to handle that.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.386
- I don't know that
that helped you.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.138
I'm not making
those mistakes.

38:25.180 --> 38:28.058
- His legal matter has nothing
to do with anything.

38:28.099 --> 38:29.768
- A Title IX violation
has nothing to do with

38:29.809 --> 38:32.562
why a university
employee was fired?

38:32.604 --> 38:34.022
- Yes. No, when it's--
- A Title IX violation?

38:34.064 --> 38:35.273
- When it's straight lies?
Think about it.

38:35.315 --> 38:39.027
The State of Maryland
is representing Juan.

38:39.069 --> 38:40.236
You know why?

38:40.278 --> 38:41.696
Because they all know
that it's bullsh--.

38:41.738 --> 38:44.783
- A Title IX violation
prohibits discrimination

38:44.824 --> 38:48.036
on sex, gender,
sexual orientation.

38:48.078 --> 38:50.830
Coaches are supposed
to be leaders.

38:50.872 --> 38:53.208
If they're not of good
moral standing,

38:53.249 --> 38:55.377
that trickles down
to the entire team.

38:55.418 --> 39:00.507
And between the lawsuit,
the publicity for infidelity,

39:00.548 --> 39:01.800
for her to
really think that

39:01.841 --> 39:03.259
that's not
why he got fired,

39:03.301 --> 39:06.805
Robyn, you can't
be that naive.

39:06.846 --> 39:08.056
- The university
actually knows

39:08.098 --> 39:10.183
that he did not do
anything wrong,

39:10.225 --> 39:12.560
that he called
his athletic director

39:12.602 --> 39:14.604
as soon as he found out,

39:14.646 --> 39:15.772
that they were meeting
with campus police

39:15.814 --> 39:17.649
the very next day.

39:17.691 --> 39:19.109
They know the actual facts.

39:19.150 --> 39:22.821
He didn't commit
a Title IX violation.

39:22.862 --> 39:24.322
That's all I'm saying.

39:24.364 --> 39:27.075
He did not do anything
that he was accused of

39:27.117 --> 39:28.076
in this lawsuit.

39:28.118 --> 39:31.079
There is no
Title IX violation.

39:31.121 --> 39:34.332
So, Miss Smarty-pants
can shut up

39:34.374 --> 39:38.420
'cause clearly she's trying
to make things worse.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.880
So, anyway.

39:40.922 --> 39:43.174
[sighs]
- Well, there's a lot

39:43.216 --> 39:44.592
of legality going on here.
- A lot of legal wars.

39:44.634 --> 39:46.636
Legal woes left and right.
- Yes.

39:46.678 --> 39:48.013
- So, Ashley, we're
going to bingo now?

39:48.054 --> 39:49.681
- We're gonna actually head
back to the hotel

39:49.723 --> 39:51.099
and change for
chickensh-- bingo.

39:51.141 --> 39:52.767
- Let's do it.
- All right. Love it.

39:52.809 --> 39:55.603
- Let's go.
- Chickensh-- and stilettos.

39:55.645 --> 39:56.938
- Are we walking?
- The hotel is right here.

39:56.980 --> 39:58.857
- Robyn, you asked
a good question.

39:58.898 --> 40:01.276
What can we talk about,
and what can't we talk about?

40:01.317 --> 40:05.947
- I'm not understanding
her energy toward me,

40:05.989 --> 40:07.449
but I'm gonna give her
her moment

40:07.490 --> 40:09.617
to be in her feelings,

40:09.659 --> 40:11.453
and I'll be over here,
just, you know,

40:11.494 --> 40:13.163
being moisturized.

40:13.204 --> 40:15.248
- I never thought we
would wanna walk, right?

40:15.290 --> 40:18.168
- No, but, no, it's great.
- I kinda regret it now.

40:24.674 --> 40:26.551
- A bird pooped
in the pool,

40:26.593 --> 40:29.012
and it's floating
on top of the water.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.474
- Hell no, Jason.
I jumped out the pool!

40:32.515 --> 40:33.308
I was disgusted.

40:35.685 --> 40:37.645
[laughing]

40:37.687 --> 40:40.565
- Yes, sir.

40:40.607 --> 40:42.984
Ooh, child.

40:43.026 --> 40:45.570
[humming]

40:45.612 --> 40:46.988
- Okay.
- All right.

40:47.030 --> 40:49.157
- Let's make it
happen.

40:49.199 --> 40:51.785
- Who is ready for some
chickensh-- bingo?

40:51.826 --> 40:53.536
- Yes, chicken-
chickensh-- sh-- .

40:53.578 --> 40:54.829
Chicken
chickensh-- sh-.

40:54.871 --> 40:56.331
- I have never seen women
celebrate chickensh--.

40:56.373 --> 40:57.749
- Chicken chickensh-- sh-.

41:00.835 --> 41:03.463
- Oh, I like this car.

41:03.505 --> 41:04.464
- You got space?

41:09.344 --> 41:11.554
- I cannot wait to find
out if it's really chickens

41:11.596 --> 41:12.889
that are sh---ing.
- If it is,

41:12.931 --> 41:14.349
I'm coming back to the truck
and sitting in here.

41:14.391 --> 41:16.101
[laughing]

41:16.142 --> 41:17.894
Y'all know I don't do
the dirty bird.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.521
- Do chickens bite?

41:19.562 --> 41:21.606
- What the hell is
chickensh-- bingo?

41:21.648 --> 41:23.608
- We're about to
find out, ain't we?

41:23.650 --> 41:24.693
- Have you ever done
chickensh--?

41:24.734 --> 41:25.819
- I haven't.
- I'm glad you guys

41:25.860 --> 41:28.029
are sitting next
to each other.

41:28.071 --> 41:30.865
- Do you feel different
from breakfast?

41:30.907 --> 41:31.950
- Yeah.
- What? I don't-- what happened?

41:31.991 --> 41:33.076
- 'Cause the screaming
at breakfast.

41:33.118 --> 41:34.202
- Why do I need to feel
any different?

41:34.244 --> 41:35.537
- Maybe there could be
a conversation.

41:35.578 --> 41:38.289
- I'm not even--
I'm not interested

41:38.331 --> 41:41.167
in a conversation at all.

41:41.209 --> 41:44.129
I feel like trying to imply
that something that I said

41:44.170 --> 41:46.089
had something to do
with Juan being fired,

41:46.131 --> 41:47.882
it just-- it didn't
feel good to me.

41:47.924 --> 41:50.760
- I honestly believe
it's not smart

41:50.802 --> 41:54.472
to speak about any ongoing
legal situation,

41:54.514 --> 41:56.224
and I don't--
I-I don't know,

41:56.266 --> 42:01.021
but I don't believe that it
helped what happened with Juan.

42:01.062 --> 42:02.272
- It had nothing
to do with it.

42:02.313 --> 42:03.648
- And I-- okay, you say that,
and that's fine.

42:03.690 --> 42:05.734
[sighs]
God.

42:05.775 --> 42:08.153
- This is the worst part
of everything

42:08.194 --> 42:09.612
that we've been
going through.

42:09.654 --> 42:12.532
- Oh, God,
please don't cry

42:12.574 --> 42:13.867
'cause I don't have
any tissue.

42:13.908 --> 42:15.744
Oh, my God, I don't
have any tissue.

42:15.785 --> 42:17.287
- And you turn it around
to a Title IX violation.

42:17.328 --> 42:19.581
Like, I don't know what
y'all are talking about.

42:19.622 --> 42:21.791
- Well, you
don't talk to us.

42:21.833 --> 42:24.252
- Please stop. Please.

42:24.294 --> 42:25.754
- Robyn, don't cry.

42:25.795 --> 42:27.297
- There's nothing going on.

42:31.593 --> 42:35.847
