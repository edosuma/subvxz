WEBVTT

01:49.784 --> 01:52.654
Getting closer, ain't ya?

01:56.125 --> 01:58.760
Whoa! Ah!

02:02.864 --> 02:04.833
Ha ha!
I knew it!

02:04.900 --> 02:06.902
I knew it! I knew it!

02:24.786 --> 02:26.889
I knew it!
I'm not crazy!

02:26.956 --> 02:27.856
I knew it!

02:27.923 --> 02:30.192
It's been circling for days.

02:35.563 --> 02:36.698
Okay.

03:39.295 --> 03:40.229
Eh.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.433
Where you at?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.102
Come on.
Where you at?

03:53.808 --> 03:55.677
Come on. Where are you?
Huh?

04:00.082 --> 04:03.152
They said I was crazy.
I'm not crazy.

04:03.219 --> 04:07.289
It's 40 degrees. 40...
40 north.

04:07.356 --> 04:09.024
115.

04:09.091 --> 04:11.894
Dammit. Still half an hour
until Shepherd's there.

04:11.961 --> 04:13.963
It's early.

04:16.098 --> 04:18.700
Dale for Shepherd.
Come in Shepherd.

04:18.766 --> 04:20.402
Dammit.

04:20.469 --> 04:25.608
Sy, if... if you're listening,
if anyone is listening,

04:25.673 --> 04:30.312
at 0600 a vessel of
unknown origin

04:30.379 --> 04:33.949
has crash landed in, uh,

04:34.016 --> 04:38.220
40 degrees north, 115 west.

04:40.623 --> 04:42.992
Shepherd, I told you.

04:43.058 --> 04:46.128
I told everyone,
and now I have proof!

04:46.195 --> 04:48.030
It's been circling for days,
and they...

04:48.097 --> 04:50.332
they've finally arrived.

04:50.399 --> 04:51.333
They've arrived.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.734
They're...

04:52.800 --> 04:54.736
They're... they're here.

04:57.606 --> 05:00.209
Come on, where you at?

05:07.715 --> 05:08.850
Where they at?

05:13.489 --> 05:14.856
Ah!

05:58.968 --> 06:01.070
<i>In 1947, mankind
learned that we are</i>

06:01.136 --> 06:04.073
<i>far from alone in the galaxy.</i>

06:04.139 --> 06:05.908
<i>In the decades to follow,
we discovered dozens</i>

06:05.975 --> 06:08.143
<i>of intelligent
extraterrestrial species</i>

06:08.210 --> 06:12.381
<i>with the capability
of reaching Earth.</i>

06:12.448 --> 06:15.918
<i>Some of them are friendly...
but some of them are not,</i>

06:15.985 --> 06:18.454
<i>so the US developed
the Alien Defense Unit.</i>

06:18.520 --> 06:21.123
<i>If you're hearing this,
it's because you've been</i>

06:21.190 --> 06:25.427
<i>selected to join
this elite force.</i>

06:25.494 --> 06:28.197
<i>Together we work in secret
to study, communicate with,</i>

06:28.264 --> 06:33.801
<i>and, if necessary, defeat
these alien entities.</i>

06:33.868 --> 06:35.971
<i>They can be powerful allies...</i>

06:36.038 --> 06:38.707
<i>or terrifying new threats.</i>

06:38.773 --> 06:41.310
<i>Now it's up to you
to know the difference,</i>

06:41.377 --> 06:45.180
<i>and to defend our planet
if and when the time comes.</i>

06:48.017 --> 06:50.052
<i>Welcome to the ADU.</i>

07:18.047 --> 07:20.182
Oh, seven hundred.

07:20.249 --> 07:23.619
Come in,
this Early Bird for the Worm.

07:23.686 --> 07:24.687
Hello?

07:24.753 --> 07:27.056
Dale, come in.

07:27.122 --> 07:30.059
Dale? It's Shepherd.
You out there, bud?

07:34.596 --> 07:37.399
Come on, don't make me
come looking for you.

07:45.474 --> 07:49.011
I told you to lay off of
that moonshine of yours

07:49.078 --> 07:51.280
or I'd have to come out
and confiscate it.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.556
All right, Dale,
this isn't funny.

08:04.993 --> 08:06.995
Shepherd over and out.

08:10.332 --> 08:11.767
Ooh.

08:11.834 --> 08:14.036
Colonel Mayweather.
Good morning, sir.

08:14.103 --> 08:15.704
That could change, Shepherd.

08:15.771 --> 08:17.706
I'm sure you're aware
that reported sightings

08:17.773 --> 08:20.342
in your sector were ten times
the monthly average last night?

08:20.409 --> 08:21.610
Right?

08:21.677 --> 08:24.480
Yes. I have a call
into my guy at NORAD.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.081
Don't bother NORAD.

08:26.148 --> 08:27.883
The Air Force wasn't flying,
and our satellites

08:27.950 --> 08:29.651
didn't get a picture of
anything but a lot of desert.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.754
You think something
came down and we missed it?

08:31.820 --> 08:34.857
Well, Since Roswell,
nothing falls from the sky

08:34.923 --> 08:37.525
that isn't tagged and
tracked before John Q. Public

08:37.592 --> 08:39.895
<i>can pick up a smartphone
and snap a picture.</i>

08:39.962 --> 08:43.131
But hundreds of people have
been calling from your sector

08:43.198 --> 08:45.901
reporting that they've
seen some...

08:45.968 --> 08:49.471
fireball in the sky.

08:49.538 --> 08:50.939
A fireball.

08:51.006 --> 08:55.577
Now, is there anything from your
security details last night?

08:55.644 --> 08:57.179
Anything to suggest this?

08:57.246 --> 09:00.249
No, sir.
Business as usual.

09:00.315 --> 09:02.418
Nothing?
Come on. Nothing weird?

09:02.484 --> 09:04.119
Well, I mean, now that
you mention it,

09:04.186 --> 09:08.323
we do have a local guy out
here that radios me

09:08.390 --> 09:10.726
an all clear every morning
like clockwork.

09:10.793 --> 09:12.394
<i>It's not exactly
confirmation of</i>

09:12.461 --> 09:16.031
<i>an alien invasion
or anything, but</i>

09:16.098 --> 09:17.466
I haven't heard from him today,

09:17.533 --> 09:20.035
and I don't much
like the coincidence.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.837
You know, if he saw a fireball,

09:21.905 --> 09:23.907
he's the kind of guy
that would go looking for it.

09:23.972 --> 09:26.775
Well, you know, usually
I'd avoid getting my intel

09:26.842 --> 09:29.011
from the tin foil hat community,

09:29.077 --> 09:30.914
but sometimes
you gotta hand it to 'em.

09:30.979 --> 09:33.348
Right now that's the best lead
we have, so let's go with it.

09:33.415 --> 09:34.950
We'll check it out pronto, sir.

09:35.017 --> 09:36.385
<i>Now, if something
did come down,</i>

09:36.452 --> 09:38.987
it was invisible until
it was in your airspace.

09:39.054 --> 09:41.323
I need you to confirm
and contain

09:41.390 --> 09:44.993
<i>any conceivable alien force
or give me an all clear.</i>

09:45.060 --> 09:48.197
Otherwise you know
what the protocol is.

09:49.865 --> 09:51.333
I do.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.769
I'm sure it's just, um,
some piece of alien junk

09:53.836 --> 09:56.305
that we don't want falling
into the wrong hands.

09:56.371 --> 09:57.606
<i>We've seen what happens
when these extraterrestrials</i>

09:57.673 --> 09:59.441
<i>make it planetside.</i>

09:59.508 --> 10:01.443
<i>There's a big difference
when they're "just visiting".</i>

10:01.510 --> 10:03.445
<i>When they come in peace they
normally make a show of it.</i>

10:03.512 --> 10:05.915
<i>It's when they're sneaky
that I start to get itchy,</i>

10:05.981 --> 10:07.649
<i>so use precaution.</i>

10:07.716 --> 10:12.588
<i>Because when it goes the other
way, it goes bad, so...</i>

10:12.654 --> 10:14.323
- Colonel?
- Mora?

10:14.389 --> 10:17.192
Specialist Fairchild
should be inbound now.

10:18.293 --> 10:20.395
One other thing, Shepherd.

10:20.462 --> 10:23.332
I expedited the transfer
of your new specialist.

10:23.398 --> 10:26.068
<i>She should be there shortly.</i>

10:26.134 --> 10:27.569
Utilize her.

10:27.636 --> 10:30.739
The A.D.U.
is, um, it's changing.

10:30.806 --> 10:33.575
They're pushing the old grunts
like us out

10:33.642 --> 10:38.547
and, um, bringing in these
new xeno-anthropologists.

10:38.614 --> 10:40.048
<i>Alien experts.</i>

10:40.115 --> 10:41.183
They think that these
young kids can talk

10:41.250 --> 10:42.618
to these big-headed monsters.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.819
I don't know.

10:43.887 --> 10:45.354
That's not exactly accurate.

10:45.420 --> 10:49.191
Shepherd, say hello
to Melissa Mora.

10:49.258 --> 10:50.826
- Master Sergeant.
- Ma'am.

10:50.894 --> 10:52.861
I'm looking forward to hearing
what you find out there.

10:52.929 --> 10:55.264
<i>I'm sure you're aware,
but your team has</i>

10:55.330 --> 10:57.099
significantly expanded
our understanding

10:57.165 --> 10:59.801
of alien culture and technology.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.470
Happy to help.

11:01.537 --> 11:04.139
Here's to one last
find before you retire.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.309
Uh, well, that depends
on what we find.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.779
With all due respect,
I'm not done yet.

11:10.846 --> 11:12.882
<i>There's still plenty
to do here.</i>

11:12.949 --> 11:14.583
<i>Retirement seems a ways off.</i>

11:14.650 --> 11:16.618
<i>Could be sooner than you think,
but before you go,</i>

11:16.685 --> 11:19.388
Shepherd,
Fairchild is the best

11:19.454 --> 11:21.256
and the brightest of
this new generation.

11:21.323 --> 11:24.593
<i>Army, Air Force, MIT.</i>

11:24.660 --> 11:27.729
It wasn't challenging enough for
her, so I'm sending her to you.

11:27.796 --> 11:30.465
And I need you to take an
active role in her training,

11:30.532 --> 11:32.401
<i>because when all
this shit's over with,</i>

11:32.467 --> 11:34.436
she's going to be
your replacement.

11:39.641 --> 11:41.143
Thank you.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.811
So, what are you in for?

12:17.613 --> 12:18.747
How do you mean?

12:20.349 --> 12:24.653
Well, I was on the
fire team that relocated

12:24.720 --> 12:27.456
the spacecraft from
the dig in Turkey.

12:27.522 --> 12:31.493
That's how I found out that
aliens are, you know, real.

12:34.363 --> 12:36.131
We got a guy on the
base that brought

12:36.198 --> 12:40.535
his date to the test site.

12:40.602 --> 12:41.703
Idiot.

12:43.605 --> 12:46.341
Point is, if you end up
on this detail,

12:46.408 --> 12:48.644
you either screw up
or you see something

12:48.710 --> 12:51.780
that you're not supposed to.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.148
I see.

12:53.215 --> 12:55.684
So which is it for you?

12:55.751 --> 12:56.818
I requested it.

12:59.022 --> 13:02.457
Life outside our solar system
is a statistical likelihood.

13:02.524 --> 13:05.160
Once I realized that,
I knew I would do anything

13:05.227 --> 13:06.395
to make first contact.

13:07.964 --> 13:10.265
Well, I've seen enough
alien weapons to know that

13:10.332 --> 13:15.004
if I'm the one making
the first contact,

13:15.071 --> 13:17.239
it's gonna be with this bad boy.

13:17.305 --> 13:19.207
You know what I mean?

13:19.274 --> 13:20.509
Don't you think a first contact

13:20.575 --> 13:23.012
should be more
delicate than that?

13:23.079 --> 13:25.814
Not if you want to survive it.

13:25.882 --> 13:28.617
Why do you think no one ever
mentions a second contact?

13:28.684 --> 13:31.087
That's something
I'm hoping can change.

13:31.154 --> 13:33.388
Well, good luck with that.

13:39.294 --> 13:40.395
Let's go, newbie.

13:52.607 --> 13:56.478
Welcome to
the Alien Defense Unit.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.947
Don't let the looks fool you.

13:58.014 --> 14:00.415
There's more underground
than there is above.

14:00.482 --> 14:01.951
It's hot out here.

14:02.018 --> 14:05.387
This is just where we hang out
and eat and sleep

14:05.454 --> 14:08.057
and train and live,

14:08.124 --> 14:09.291
and probably die.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.861
You'll get used to it.

14:15.297 --> 14:16.798
Where do I find Shepherd?

14:16.865 --> 14:18.300
This way.

14:55.337 --> 14:57.439
You must be
Specialist Fairchild.

14:57.506 --> 14:59.407
Reporting for duty, Sergeant.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.544
Uh, sir, I've already
been briefed

15:02.611 --> 15:04.346
on the anomaly in your sector.

15:05.747 --> 15:07.783
It's our sector now,
isn't it, Specialist?

15:07.849 --> 15:09.351
Yes, sir.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.319
I've taken a closer look
at the satellite imagery

15:11.386 --> 15:12.654
and there seems to be
something causing

15:12.721 --> 15:16.625
a blind spot in your...
our sector, sir.

15:16.691 --> 15:18.827
There's no technology on Earth
that I'm aware of

15:18.895 --> 15:20.930
that can do that.

15:20.997 --> 15:24.366
I've sent in a request to
the USGS for a seismic report.

15:24.432 --> 15:26.701
It's possible
whatever fell...

15:33.375 --> 15:34.609
Who mans this comms room?

15:36.745 --> 15:38.446
You do.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.382
Sir, sorry for asking,

15:40.448 --> 15:43.652
but I notice that most of the
staff here is combat oriented.

15:43.718 --> 15:45.188
Don't you think
the unit would benefit

15:45.254 --> 15:47.756
from more science personnel?

15:47.823 --> 15:49.357
We have Bob.

15:49.424 --> 15:51.493
Uh...

15:51.560 --> 15:53.728
Oh yes.
Engineer Robert Drake.

15:53.795 --> 15:55.664
I mean, he's a civilian.

15:55.730 --> 15:57.699
Only on paper.

15:57.766 --> 16:00.569
Bob's got PhDs in science
that don't even exist yet.

16:00.635 --> 16:05.074
Sir, if you don't mind, while
we're on the topic of personnel,

16:05.141 --> 16:06.976
I think it's best that
we don't inform the men

16:07.043 --> 16:09.946
that I'm replacing you
until it actually happens.

16:12.581 --> 16:15.383
I would like to observe
the unit first.

16:18.321 --> 16:19.554
Noted.

16:23.425 --> 16:24.793
Hut!

16:27.997 --> 16:29.031
Where's Bob?

16:29.098 --> 16:30.967
On PT with Matteo, sir.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.068
King?

16:32.134 --> 16:34.402
Getting his pack, sir.

16:34.469 --> 16:37.039
Gentlemen, this here
is Specialist Fairchild.

16:37.106 --> 16:38.773
Welcome her to the unit.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.376
Welcome Specialist Fairchild!

16:41.443 --> 16:43.445
Thanks.

16:43.511 --> 16:46.015
Better make a good
impression on her.

16:46.082 --> 16:48.783
She's gonna take over once
they boot me out of here.

16:53.122 --> 16:54.689
You two kit up.
You're with me.

16:54.756 --> 16:56.325
We're wheels in five.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.261
Get Matteo on the radio
and let's get Bob out here

16:58.327 --> 17:00.795
for a meet and greet.

17:00.862 --> 17:03.598
Everybody standby for orders.
Dismissed.

17:04.531 --> 17:05.902
Where are we heading?

17:05.968 --> 17:07.868
I am headed up to
my friend Dale's place.

17:07.936 --> 17:09.171
I'm gonna have a look around.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.272
I think you should stay here.

17:10.339 --> 17:11.941
You want me to stay here?

17:12.008 --> 17:13.943
If something's on the ground,
I want to see it pronto.

17:14.010 --> 17:15.477
I want to ID it.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.380
Someone's gotta go through
the call logs from last night

17:17.444 --> 17:20.282
for mentions of a "fireball."
You're the specialist.

17:20.348 --> 17:21.750
Plot out the sightings.

17:21.816 --> 17:23.550
Maybe we can come up
with a flight path.

17:23.617 --> 17:24.653
You've got your orders.

17:24.719 --> 17:26.521
Shouldn't I go with you?

17:28.657 --> 17:31.160
Specialist, you're my trainee.

17:31.227 --> 17:32.827
I don't know what
Mayweather told you,

17:32.895 --> 17:35.398
but I haven't retired yet.

17:35.463 --> 17:40.468
And until your training is over,
you're with me until I say so.

17:41.836 --> 17:44.472
You're here to learn, not lead.

17:44.539 --> 17:46.175
Understood?

17:46.242 --> 17:48.344
Yes, sir.

17:48.411 --> 17:49.912
Permission to speak freely, sir?

17:49.979 --> 17:51.646
Denied.

17:51.713 --> 17:54.984
If there's a ship out there,
I should be the one to find it.

17:57.086 --> 17:59.454
I guess that's
the difference between us.

17:59.521 --> 18:02.091
I hope we don't find anything.

18:08.863 --> 18:11.133
You got this?
Let's go, walk in the park.

18:13.269 --> 18:15.804
Oh, shit.

18:15.870 --> 18:20.042
Can we please be done now?

18:20.109 --> 18:21.410
Come on, Bob.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.012
How are we supposed to
fight when the aliens attack

18:23.079 --> 18:25.214
if you can't even handle
a little cardio?

18:25.281 --> 18:26.648
You'll really be
screwed when you have

18:26.715 --> 18:28.150
100 pounds of gear on you!

18:30.719 --> 18:33.289
Yeah. Attack.

18:33.356 --> 18:34.991
Why do you think... why...

18:35.057 --> 18:38.327
why does everyone always
think that it's an attack, huh?

18:38.394 --> 18:40.029
They been here before.

18:40.096 --> 18:42.465
There've been crashes,
mistakes, misunderstandings,

18:42.530 --> 18:46.501
and yeah, a fight or two, but
there's never been an attack.

18:46.568 --> 18:48.237
We'd be dead!

18:48.304 --> 18:50.872
Then what will it look like
when... if the aliens come back?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.580
Honestly, I don't know.

18:59.949 --> 19:01.516
That's why I need
to be in the lab,

19:01.583 --> 19:05.687
not out here training
for combat.

19:05.754 --> 19:07.890
Why am I the only one
that you do this to, huh?

19:07.957 --> 19:09.624
Because everyone else
has been through boot.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.093
You haven't.

19:13.996 --> 19:17.099
Maybe they're studying us,
the aliens.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.268
Studying us?

19:19.335 --> 19:20.302
Yeah.

19:20.369 --> 19:22.038
All right.

19:22.104 --> 19:24.140
If they're so advanced, why
would they give a shit about us?

19:27.476 --> 19:29.078
Why do we study ants?

19:30.812 --> 19:32.281
To figure out how to kill them.

19:33.681 --> 19:36.218
<i>Roman to Matteo.</i>

19:36.285 --> 19:38.553
Go for Matteo.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.390
<i>Shepherd wants to egghead
Bob back at the base ASAP.</i>

19:41.457 --> 19:43.959
Everyone's on standby.

19:44.026 --> 19:45.895
We just got here.
What's going on?

19:45.961 --> 19:47.496
Don't know. Shepherd's off
site with Sams and King.

19:47.562 --> 19:48.964
Full kit.
He wants you ready to rock.

19:49.031 --> 19:50.865
- <i>Copy?</i>
- Copy. On our way.

19:52.268 --> 19:53.768
Full kit?

19:55.137 --> 19:56.838
What... what's that mean,
ready... ready to rock?

19:56.906 --> 19:59.208
It means on your feet, Bob.

19:59.275 --> 20:01.776
Let's go take a look through
that alien arsenal of yours.

20:03.012 --> 20:04.246
Come on.
Double time.

20:04.313 --> 20:05.847
Just give me a second.

20:07.116 --> 20:08.783
I'm leaving the weights here.

20:20.862 --> 20:23.798
Okay. Let's see what
we have to work with.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.159
Is that everything?

20:54.196 --> 20:56.664
Everything that I've got
that's operational.

20:56.731 --> 20:58.200
Heavily modified, of course.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.735
All the tech that
we've recovered is ancient,

21:00.802 --> 21:03.906
found in archeological digs
and in frozen ice,

21:03.973 --> 21:06.208
and if it wasn't
for that Roswell crash

21:06.275 --> 21:08.611
and everything
we found afterwards,

21:08.676 --> 21:11.679
I might not have been able to
get any of this stuff to work.

21:11.746 --> 21:14.316
You've seen the Roswell UFO?

21:14.383 --> 21:17.353
It's not unidentified anymore.
Everyone knows that.

21:17.419 --> 21:20.055
And yes, I've seen seven.

21:20.122 --> 21:22.224
I even got to
go inside one once.

21:25.194 --> 21:27.263
It was cramped.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.697
Little guys, huh?
Three fingers?

21:35.037 --> 21:37.805
That tech right there
is the same stuff

21:37.872 --> 21:41.143
that the spaceships use
to generate anti-gravity

21:41.210 --> 21:45.281
for navigation in a...
a gravity gauntlet.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.749
We found that underneath
the pyramids.

21:47.815 --> 21:49.385
Once upon a time that
thing would literally

21:49.451 --> 21:53.189
just reach out and shape
the earth, move massive objects

21:53.255 --> 21:56.225
all by manipulating
the force of gravity.

21:57.759 --> 22:00.529
I think, anyways.

22:00.596 --> 22:04.333
Well, if you ask me,
that's all we need right there.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.136
Let's pack this baby up
and spank these aliens

22:07.203 --> 22:08.470
with a fist full of gravity.

22:08.537 --> 22:09.905
Hoo-rah.

22:09.972 --> 22:11.407
Well, it's missing
a power source.

22:11.473 --> 22:15.344
It needs, well, more amps
than the human race

22:15.411 --> 22:18.447
has conceived since
the industrial revolution.

22:18.514 --> 22:22.017
So, uh, right now,
it's kind of just an ornament.

22:22.084 --> 22:24.587
It's just a reminder.

22:24.653 --> 22:26.255
Reminder of what?

22:28.490 --> 22:30.792
3,000 years ago,
while we were rubbing sticks

22:30.858 --> 22:36.065
together to make fire, they
harnessed the power of gravity,

22:36.131 --> 22:39.368
and we can't even turn it on.

22:39.435 --> 22:41.836
So, it's a reminder that
we're contending with forces

22:41.904 --> 22:45.174
far beyond what
we even hope to be one day.

22:46.675 --> 22:49.511
But I swear I'm gonna
get that baby to work.

22:58.554 --> 23:01.123
Establish wireless connection
and take control.

23:05.461 --> 23:08.330
Average the report sightings
and display vector.

23:14.703 --> 23:16.205
Adjust for Shepherd's heading.

23:19.475 --> 23:22.344
Now display new
seismic data and overlay.

23:31.687 --> 23:33.188
Something did fall.

23:35.624 --> 23:37.326
Shepherd, this is Fairchild.

23:37.393 --> 23:38.927
I think you need
to stop the truck.

23:38.994 --> 23:41.563
Shepherd, did you read?
Stop the truck!

23:54.877 --> 23:57.012
Fairchild, come in, Fairchild.

23:57.079 --> 23:58.480
It's jammed.

23:58.547 --> 24:01.350
Did she say something came down?

24:25.607 --> 24:27.509
You guys hold here
for just a second.

24:30.579 --> 24:32.114
Heya, Dale?

24:51.934 --> 24:53.402
Got some blood here, Shep.

26:06.341 --> 26:08.410
Pack this up for Bob.

26:20.355 --> 26:24.026
Sounds like Dale
might be getting a signal.

26:35.237 --> 26:36.638
Dale, are you in there?

26:42.211 --> 26:43.512
There's something...

26:45.047 --> 26:46.181
There's something here, Shep.

26:47.917 --> 26:49.251
Possible contamination.

27:05.267 --> 27:07.636
Hey, why don't you
get on his radio?

27:07.703 --> 27:11.206
See if you can, uh,
get in touch with base.

27:13.775 --> 27:15.077
Copy that.

27:15.143 --> 27:17.746
Could be he's got
a better signal out.

27:20.984 --> 27:22.751
Dale, what'd you find out here?

27:29.157 --> 27:30.592
There's nothing here.

27:35.497 --> 27:38.033
Jesus!

27:38.100 --> 27:39.401
Get in the truck!

27:39.468 --> 27:42.037
- What about King?
- Get in the truck!

27:42.104 --> 27:44.806
Ahh! Ahh!

27:49.645 --> 27:51.613
It's not down!

28:03.993 --> 28:04.928
Hey, it's...

28:04.994 --> 28:06.595
Shepherd to base.

28:06.662 --> 28:08.163
It's growing!

28:08.230 --> 28:11.066
Threat confirmed.
Threat confirmed!

28:14.169 --> 28:15.103
We're under attack!

28:15.170 --> 28:16.805
Sams!

28:20.509 --> 28:21.476
Atta boy.

28:33.422 --> 28:35.724
Whoo!
That's what I'm talking about.

28:35.791 --> 28:37.961
We're gonna bring
this baby with us.

28:38.027 --> 28:40.729
Well, we... we kind of can't.

28:40.796 --> 28:41.998
I... I still have
to figure out how to power that

28:42.065 --> 28:43.532
out in the field.

28:43.599 --> 28:45.267
I' d have to plug it directly
into the grid

28:45.334 --> 28:46.970
to get enough power
for more than one shot.

28:47.036 --> 28:49.137
This seems to be a reoccurring
issue with you, Bob.

28:49.204 --> 28:50.272
Well...

28:50.339 --> 28:51.640
Do you have anything that works?

28:51.707 --> 28:53.475
<i>Matteo, what's your twenty?</i>

28:53.542 --> 28:55.477
Specialist Fairchild needs
you in the radio room now.

28:55.544 --> 28:57.179
- <i>Copy?</i>
- Copy.

28:57.245 --> 28:59.181
In the warehouse.
On our way.

28:59.247 --> 29:02.117
- Who?
- I don't know.

29:02.184 --> 29:04.319
I swear I have stuff
that works, okay?

29:04.386 --> 29:06.521
Careful with that. Geez.

29:09.725 --> 29:11.493
Listen to this.

29:17.599 --> 29:19.102
I've been recording
every signal

29:19.167 --> 29:20.402
that's strong enough
to come through.

29:20.469 --> 29:22.237
This is the only one.

29:28.243 --> 29:29.979
Holy shit.

29:30.046 --> 29:31.480
That was five minutes ago.

29:31.546 --> 29:33.315
I already sent it
to Mayweather.

29:33.382 --> 29:35.183
I caught a recording
off the citizen's band.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.152
Shepherd must have found
a working frequency.

29:37.219 --> 29:38.654
He said "attack."

29:38.720 --> 29:40.489
That... that doesn't
make any sense.

29:40.555 --> 29:42.591
Looks like your
theory was wrong Bob,

29:42.658 --> 29:44.526
'cause it makes perfect
sense to me.

29:46.461 --> 29:48.463
Mayweather's calling.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.265
I guess you're in charge now.

29:50.332 --> 29:51.867
Better go answer it.

29:59.876 --> 30:01.443
<i>Fairchild, I've listened
to the transmission.</i>

30:01.510 --> 30:04.179
Hate to ask, but any
word from Shepherd yet

30:04.246 --> 30:05.480
<i>or is he still MIA?</i>

30:05.547 --> 30:07.116
Not since
the last transmission, sir.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.850
<i>It's clear we've got an
alien crash,</i>

30:08.918 --> 30:10.285
<i>but we believe the
potential alien craft</i>

30:10.352 --> 30:11.954
<i>is jamming the signal somehow.</i>

30:12.021 --> 30:13.355
<i>So, it's possible
he's out there</i>

30:13.422 --> 30:14.891
<i>but unable to make contact.</i>

30:14.957 --> 30:16.858
I sent his last transmission
to the Joint Chiefs

30:16.926 --> 30:18.326
<i>and they're calling
it proof enough to initiate</i>

30:18.393 --> 30:20.096
<i>the Helion Measure.</i>

30:20.163 --> 30:23.099
Fairchild, looks like your
training's been cut short.

30:23.166 --> 30:27.703
Your mission clock is ticking,
so what do you recommend?

30:27.769 --> 30:29.204
Anything?

30:29.271 --> 30:31.174
It's my opinion, sir,
that the recordings tell us

30:31.239 --> 30:33.943
what we already know, something
went down last night.

30:34.010 --> 30:36.445
<i>Between the flight path
and Shepherd's last location,</i>

30:36.511 --> 30:38.747
I think we have a
small enough search radius

30:38.814 --> 30:40.649
for the three of us and
the team here to cover it

30:40.716 --> 30:42.617
within a reasonable
mission window.

30:42.684 --> 30:44.887
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:44.954 --> 30:47.389
I'm not going anywhere.
I don't need to be out there.

30:47.456 --> 30:48.857
I... I need to be here.

30:48.925 --> 30:50.625
I'll need Bob's
technical expertise

30:50.692 --> 30:52.661
at the crash site to
accurately access the threat.

30:52.728 --> 30:54.262
<i>There's no one
on Earth more qualified</i>

30:54.329 --> 30:56.364
to identify alien technology.

30:59.501 --> 31:01.536
<i>Matteo, is it?
Lance Corporal.</i>

31:01.603 --> 31:03.072
Yes, sir.

31:03.139 --> 31:05.108
<i>Your orders are to
locate the crash site</i>

31:05.174 --> 31:08.945
<i>and recover your commanding
officer or confirm his death.</i>

31:09.011 --> 31:11.580
<i>I need containment
and elimination</i>

31:11.646 --> 31:13.448
<i>of the alien threat
before sundown</i>

31:13.515 --> 31:15.918
or I assume you know
the protocol, right, Fairchild?

31:15.985 --> 31:17.586
I do, sir.

31:17.652 --> 31:19.588
<i>Good, because there's
no time left to waste.</i>

31:19.654 --> 31:21.490
<i>Find the rest of your team
and get them back safe.</i>

31:21.556 --> 31:23.625
<i>I'm counting on all of you.
Good luck.</i>

31:24.994 --> 31:26.328
Mayweather out.

31:28.164 --> 31:29.598
What did he mean?

31:29.664 --> 31:32.034
Protocol?
Well, what's protocol?

31:32.101 --> 31:34.170
The Helion Measure.

31:34.237 --> 31:38.440
A thermonuclear warhead launched
from an orbital satellite.

31:38.507 --> 31:40.209
Are you serious?

31:40.275 --> 31:42.310
Only in the event
that the alien threat

31:42.377 --> 31:44.279
spreads beyond our ability
to contain it.

31:44.346 --> 31:45.647
Why didn't I know about this?

31:45.714 --> 31:47.282
Because you're a civilian, Bob.

31:47.349 --> 31:48.550
You don't have the clearance.

31:48.617 --> 31:50.219
If I would've known that, I...

31:50.285 --> 31:52.354
I wouldn't have brought
my entire collection here.

31:52.420 --> 31:54.991
The contents of
that warehouse is...

31:55.057 --> 31:57.325
irreplaceable, literally.

31:57.392 --> 32:00.829
All my work,
countless alien artifacts.

32:00.897 --> 32:02.731
I... I mean, nothing
would survive that blast.

32:02.798 --> 32:05.367
That's the point, Bob.

32:05.433 --> 32:06.501
We're here.

32:06.568 --> 32:08.470
That... that nuclear blast,

32:08.537 --> 32:10.106
that will eradicate
this entire area,

32:10.173 --> 32:13.176
not to mention kill hundreds
of thousands of people.

32:13.242 --> 32:15.978
It's not going to come to that.

32:16.045 --> 32:20.216
Did you hear that thing
on the recording?

32:20.283 --> 32:24.120
Something is out there,
and we don't know what it is.

32:24.187 --> 32:26.388
I mean, breathing the same air
as it could be lethal.

32:26.454 --> 32:29.758
For all we know,
it's a biological attack.

32:29.825 --> 32:33.062
So we follow protocol
and we wear our masks.

32:34.496 --> 32:36.565
And what if the aliens
just kills us?

32:36.631 --> 32:38.333
I hear you have a
whole alien arsenal;

32:38.400 --> 32:40.036
is that true?

32:40.102 --> 32:41.503
Yes.

32:41.570 --> 32:44.706
Good. Then bring it.
We have our orders.

32:44.773 --> 32:48.077
Secure the crash site, identify
the threat, and eliminate it.

32:48.144 --> 32:49.511
What about Shepherd?

32:49.578 --> 32:51.047
Shouldn't we be
heading to Dale's?

32:51.113 --> 32:53.381
If he's alive, his orders
are the same as ours:

32:53.448 --> 32:55.184
Identify and contain.

32:55.251 --> 32:57.819
I want to know what we're up
against before we run into it.

32:57.887 --> 33:01.090
Whatever's jamming the signal
is coming from that crash.

33:01.157 --> 33:02.858
If Bob can disable it,

33:02.925 --> 33:04.994
then we can use the satellites
to find Shepherd's vehicle

33:05.061 --> 33:07.096
and hopefully figure out
what we're dealing with.

33:07.163 --> 33:10.632
That means the crash site
is our first priority.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.969
Round up, bring everything
that you need.

33:13.035 --> 33:15.403
That includes you, Bob.

33:15.470 --> 33:16.939
Let's go.

33:18.607 --> 33:21.543
Wait, n... no.

33:21.610 --> 33:24.080
What did I tell... I...
I'm not going anywhere.

33:38.793 --> 33:40.930
Road ends here, we'll have
to go the rest on foot.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.699
This should be it.

33:48.436 --> 33:49.906
All right.
Put on your mask.

33:49.972 --> 33:51.439
Stay sharp.

33:51.506 --> 33:53.775
We don't know how many targets
we might be dealing with.

34:01.017 --> 34:03.886
Those alien guns of
Bob's work, right?

34:03.953 --> 34:04.987
Oh, yeah.

34:06.389 --> 34:07.622
Good.

34:08.623 --> 34:10.359
Should be just over that ridge.

34:10.425 --> 34:12.627
Make it safe and
hold position.

34:12.694 --> 34:14.096
We're right behind you.

34:14.163 --> 34:15.164
Bob, let's go.

34:16.697 --> 34:18.600
Bob, gonna need you out here.

34:18.667 --> 34:20.101
I'll bring up the van.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.838
Van's close enough, Bob.
Let's go.

34:25.007 --> 34:27.742
You know, you might have
to follow orders,

34:27.809 --> 34:30.112
but I'm technically
just a civilian, remember?

34:31.713 --> 34:34.016
Cut the shit, Bob.

34:34.083 --> 34:37.219
We both know your choices were
here or a mile under Groom Lake.

34:39.587 --> 34:41.656
I read your file,
your whole file,

34:41.723 --> 34:43.824
even your unredacted thesis.

34:43.893 --> 34:45.027
Hmm.

34:45.094 --> 34:46.929
I thought they erased all
my academic work.

34:49.065 --> 34:50.333
With what you know,

34:50.399 --> 34:52.634
they'll never let you go
back to civilian life.

34:52.701 --> 34:54.803
Your deal was a hole
in the ground

34:54.869 --> 34:57.106
or a place where you
can work and see the sky,

34:57.173 --> 34:59.141
even if things are
falling out of it.

35:00.910 --> 35:03.145
I meant what I said
to Mayweather.

35:03.212 --> 35:05.247
There's no one on
Earth more qualified

35:05.314 --> 35:06.916
with alien tech than you.

35:06.983 --> 35:10.052
Come on, Bob, where's your
scientific curiosity?

35:10.119 --> 35:11.519
You're the expert.

35:11.586 --> 35:14.357
We need you out there.

35:14.423 --> 35:17.826
Well, you know, "by sundown"

35:17.893 --> 35:19.728
is plenty of time
for us to get outside

35:19.794 --> 35:23.265
the blast radius if we go now.

35:23.332 --> 35:25.600
Not without transpo.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.003
Bob, if we are going
to find Shepherd

35:27.069 --> 35:29.238
and complete our mission,
I need you

35:29.305 --> 35:32.841
to shut off whatever's
jamming the signal.

35:32.908 --> 35:34.343
Then, I'll check the gear.

35:34.410 --> 35:37.079
Bob, I don't need your
gear right now.

35:38.847 --> 35:41.951
I need your eyes and I need
your brain and I need your feet.

35:42.018 --> 35:43.119
Come on.

35:45.620 --> 35:47.256
I'll go when it's clear.

35:51.193 --> 35:52.962
Matteo, we clear?

35:57.933 --> 35:59.935
No tangos. We're clear.

36:00.002 --> 36:01.303
We're clear. Let's go.

36:02.537 --> 36:04.140
Coming.

36:07.109 --> 36:08.810
This is why
I don't come out here.

36:14.016 --> 36:16.318
There's a lot of shit
on the ground.

36:16.385 --> 36:17.685
Don't touch anything.

36:27.063 --> 36:28.797
All right, the atmosphere
is clear.

36:28.863 --> 36:30.598
It's okay to
take off your masks.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.936
All good?

36:37.106 --> 36:38.240
All good.

36:40.476 --> 36:42.111
No sign of Shepherd either.

36:43.645 --> 36:47.249
Oh my God, look at that thing.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.685
Matteo, Roman,
head up and take a look.

36:50.752 --> 36:53.655
Copy!
C'mon, Rome, let's go.

36:57.792 --> 36:59.161
Visual on the crash.

37:12.774 --> 37:14.143
Listen.

37:15.511 --> 37:17.313
You hear that?

37:18.514 --> 37:20.648
No.

37:22.750 --> 37:23.919
Thought I heard something.

37:25.354 --> 37:27.755
Oh, shit! Let him go!

37:29.158 --> 37:30.159
Ah!

37:32.595 --> 37:33.695
Roman!

37:33.761 --> 37:35.197
Matteo, take cover!

37:35.264 --> 37:36.631
Ah!

37:36.698 --> 37:38.267
Ridge line, fire!

37:40.469 --> 37:42.404
Keys! Keys!

37:42.471 --> 37:43.738
Come on, keys!

37:45.707 --> 37:47.109
Wait, Bob, what are you doing?

37:56.252 --> 37:57.253
Hold fire!

37:57.319 --> 37:59.721
Matteo, on your feet.
Fall back.

37:59.787 --> 38:01.590
Where is it?
I can't see anything.

38:01.656 --> 38:04.059
Cover Matteo.
Probing fire.

38:10.099 --> 38:11.567
No hits.

38:11.634 --> 38:12.767
Bob!

38:18.073 --> 38:20.576
Come on, come on,
open up, come on!

38:20.643 --> 38:21.577
Come on!

38:23.145 --> 38:24.280
Bob!

38:37.293 --> 38:38.826
I'm coming!

38:44.400 --> 38:45.833
Watch your eyes.

38:58.147 --> 39:00.182
Open fire!

39:14.063 --> 39:16.532
Anything from
Shepherd's team yet?

39:16.599 --> 39:18.267
I'm still waiting.

39:18.334 --> 39:20.970
Every eye in the sky we've
got is on the Nevada desert,

39:21.036 --> 39:24.306
yet we can't see a thing.
Hmm.

39:28.544 --> 39:31.447
Have you considered sending
in a diplomatic agent?

39:31.513 --> 39:34.083
- Someone like...
- You?

39:34.149 --> 39:38.420
No.
No, Mora, um, I haven't.

39:38.487 --> 39:40.456
I could play, uh,
Shepherd's last transmission,

39:40.522 --> 39:43.359
but it sure as shit
doesn't sound like diplomacy.

39:46.562 --> 39:48.397
And now that
we're on Helion protocol,

39:48.464 --> 39:51.300
nothing or no one can go in
or out until it's over.

39:51.367 --> 39:55.437
What I'd like to do is,
uh, send in a battalion.

39:55.504 --> 40:00.309
Along with maybe 25 guys
like me when I was 30,

40:01.677 --> 40:03.245
teach these ETs a lesson.

40:03.312 --> 40:06.482
You know, something like, um,

40:06.548 --> 40:09.885
come in peace or go in pieces.

40:11.687 --> 40:14.957
Yeah, I like that.

40:15.024 --> 40:18.826
But another day.
Dismissed.

41:40.008 --> 41:43.412
Now, we're clear.

41:43.479 --> 41:45.381
I didn't know where to shoot,
so I grabbed something

41:45.447 --> 41:47.783
that could shoot
everywhere at once.

41:47.850 --> 41:51.286
Cloaked, but not tech.

41:51.353 --> 41:53.355
Biological like a...
like a chameleon.

41:53.422 --> 41:55.624
It's not really my expertise.

41:55.691 --> 41:57.126
Bob, are you okay?

41:57.192 --> 41:59.061
Yeah. It's just I had
to overload the gear

41:59.128 --> 42:03.132
to generate enough charge
for that static blast.

42:03.198 --> 42:06.835
We... we got it, right?

42:06.902 --> 42:08.971
We got one,
but something tells me

42:09.037 --> 42:10.672
that wasn't what
Shepherd encountered.

42:10.739 --> 42:13.909
What we heard over that
transmission was big and loud.

42:13.976 --> 42:16.645
This one didn't make a sound.

42:16.712 --> 42:18.113
Bendis, wide perimeter.

42:18.180 --> 42:19.782
This might not be
our only threat.

42:19.848 --> 42:22.084
What do you want me to look for?

42:22.151 --> 42:24.019
I don't know. Footprints.

42:26.488 --> 42:28.157
Matteo, we good?

42:30.159 --> 42:31.360
Roman's dead.

42:33.495 --> 42:35.864
The others are
probably dead too.

42:35.964 --> 42:37.299
We don't know that.

42:39.201 --> 42:40.803
Shepherd knows the protocol.

42:40.869 --> 42:43.038
If he's alive, for all
we know, he's probably

42:43.105 --> 42:45.274
already heading back to base
or getting clear.

42:45.340 --> 42:47.042
Or he needs our help.

42:47.109 --> 42:48.577
You need to call Mayweather.

42:48.644 --> 42:50.279
Why?

42:50.345 --> 42:52.114
He needs to launch a nuke,
and we need to get out of here.

42:52.181 --> 42:53.615
Are you nuts?

42:53.682 --> 42:55.784
I am not losing
another man out here.

42:55.851 --> 42:57.453
Thousands of people will die.

42:57.519 --> 42:59.688
We still have time
to evacuate the region.

42:59.755 --> 43:02.357
No! No.
Not completely.

43:02.424 --> 43:05.127
Look, Shepherd didn't
even make it here.

43:05.194 --> 43:07.296
He was attacked
by something else,

43:07.362 --> 43:08.831
and there's more
of these things out here.

43:08.898 --> 43:11.633
Let's just nuke 'em
and be done with it.

43:11.700 --> 43:13.735
Hello? We're still here!

43:13.802 --> 43:15.637
Then let's not be.

43:15.704 --> 43:16.906
I'll call Mayweather.

43:16.972 --> 43:18.006
You can't.

43:18.073 --> 43:20.877
- Watch me.
- Okay.

43:20.944 --> 43:22.978
You can't.

43:23.045 --> 43:24.613
Something's jamming the signal.

43:24.680 --> 43:26.950
It's probably out there
in the crash site.

43:27.015 --> 43:30.954
We still have a mission to do
here, and we still have time.

43:31.019 --> 43:33.155
There can be something down
there that can help us.

43:33.222 --> 43:34.690
Right now I need you
on perimeter

43:34.756 --> 43:36.391
so Bob can get to work.

43:36.458 --> 43:40.028
Every minute we spend arguing
out here puts us in danger.

43:43.265 --> 43:45.234
Are they still trying
to study us, Bob?

43:45.300 --> 43:47.402
Tell me, what are they
gonna learn from this, huh?

43:47.469 --> 43:49.638
I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

43:49.705 --> 43:52.774
It's more important
what we learn here.

43:52.841 --> 43:54.911
We'll find Shepherd soon.

43:54.978 --> 43:57.179
Yeah, well, I hope so.

43:57.246 --> 43:58.714
Shepherd would know
what to do right now.

44:01.650 --> 44:04.853
Bob, we are not gonna
find Shepherd or our targets

44:04.921 --> 44:07.256
unless we figure out
what's jamming the signal.

44:07.322 --> 44:09.124
What do you got for me?

44:10.492 --> 44:13.195
Well, uh, the... the fastest
way to do that would be

44:13.262 --> 44:15.564
to shut off power
to the ship, but...

44:15.631 --> 44:18.534
with every alien craft
that I've seen,

44:18.600 --> 44:20.836
and I've seen every single
one that we know of,

44:20.904 --> 44:23.572
there's...
there's a, uh, a power cell.

44:23.639 --> 44:27.075
It's small, efficient enough
to run

44:27.142 --> 44:29.678
effectively forever.

44:29.745 --> 44:32.180
It could be anywhere out
there in the wreckage

44:32.247 --> 44:34.918
and still be feeding
the signal jammer.

44:34.984 --> 44:38.053
Okay, then let's find it.

44:38.120 --> 44:39.588
Okay.

46:20.389 --> 46:23.692
I can hear you,
you son of a bitch.

46:25.527 --> 46:27.262
I'm coming for you.

46:42.177 --> 46:43.845
Bob, tell me you
found something.

46:45.114 --> 46:46.883
Not really.

46:46.949 --> 46:49.584
Uh, from the debris that
I found, I... I can conclude

46:49.651 --> 46:54.756
that it came from the same
origin, but it's different.

46:54.823 --> 46:56.425
How?

46:56.491 --> 47:00.362
Well, for starters,
I didn't see a cockpit or...

47:00.429 --> 47:03.432
or any copilots for that matter.

47:03.498 --> 47:07.103
Um, I... I saw inside there
were like three cells

47:07.170 --> 47:09.538
maybe for cargo or for holding.

47:09.604 --> 47:11.273
I can figure it out,
I just need to kill the power.

47:11.339 --> 47:13.608
How much longer?

47:13.675 --> 47:14.743
Hold tight.

47:14.810 --> 47:16.778
Bob.
We're running out of time.

47:16.845 --> 47:20.382
Threat's ID'd and we need
to move to containment.

47:20.449 --> 47:22.085
I don't know, maybe
if we head to Dale's camp

47:22.151 --> 47:23.218
we can track it from there.

47:23.285 --> 47:26.288
No, no, no.
We split up.

47:26.354 --> 47:28.390
You get to the van
and you find Shepherd.

47:28.457 --> 47:30.059
I'll go back on board
and I'll find a way

47:30.126 --> 47:31.460
to kill the signal jammer.

47:31.526 --> 47:34.563
I just have to find
the power cell.

47:34.629 --> 47:36.264
I don't like the idea
of splitting up.

47:36.331 --> 47:38.233
Yeah, but we have to.

47:38.300 --> 47:40.368
Yeah. But we need
to find this thing.

47:42.004 --> 47:42.972
Okay.

47:44.706 --> 47:46.775
Yeah. Yeah.
Of course.

47:51.279 --> 47:52.514
What... what is that?

47:52.581 --> 47:54.951
We... are you getting
signal here, or...

47:55.017 --> 47:57.053
No signal yet, but I'm
scanning the data-sphere

47:57.120 --> 47:59.588
around the ship to see if
I can pick anything up.

47:59.654 --> 48:01.289
So far it's just scrambled code.

48:03.291 --> 48:06.361
What do you know
about the data-sphere?

48:06.428 --> 48:07.429
Everything you do.

48:07.496 --> 48:10.398
I read your work, remember?

48:10.465 --> 48:12.834
Yeah. But I just...
I just did the math.

48:12.902 --> 48:14.436
You made a...

48:14.503 --> 48:16.438
Wireless alien super computer.

48:16.505 --> 48:18.941
You did that before me?
Can I see it?

48:20.509 --> 48:23.745
Bob, I'll let you know
if I find anything.

48:23.812 --> 48:25.181
Get back to work.

48:25.248 --> 48:26.883
Okay.

48:26.949 --> 48:28.450
That's so cool.

48:28.517 --> 48:29.986
That's it, let's wrap it up.

48:30.052 --> 48:31.286
Moving out now?

48:31.353 --> 48:33.256
You and me, yes.
Bob still has work to do.

48:33.321 --> 48:35.925
If he doesn't find the power
supply and disable the jammer,

48:35.992 --> 48:37.592
we'll never find
Shepherd in time.

48:37.659 --> 48:39.628
If Bob's right,
there could be at least

48:39.694 --> 48:41.164
two more of these
things out here.

48:41.230 --> 48:42.764
Bendis, you stay with him.

48:42.831 --> 48:44.766
It's critical that
he's allowed to finish.

49:51.033 --> 49:54.937
Oh, no, oh no no no,
what did I just do?!

49:56.272 --> 49:57.974
Oh! Oh, look at that!

50:01.177 --> 50:02.844
Oh!

50:09.118 --> 50:10.052
I found it!

50:11.653 --> 50:13.222
Bob, what'd you do?

50:13.289 --> 50:14.456
I found it!

50:16.359 --> 50:17.927
Take cover, it's coming.

50:19.095 --> 50:21.463
Bendis, watch out!

50:36.879 --> 50:38.613
Bendis!

50:40.149 --> 50:41.250
Where are you going?

50:41.317 --> 50:42.651
I have an idea.

50:48.190 --> 50:49.524
Bob!

51:10.346 --> 51:11.479
Oh, sh......

51:20.755 --> 51:22.358
Shepherd, you're alive!

51:22.425 --> 51:24.226
Not for long unless
you have a plan!

51:24.293 --> 51:25.694
- Here, put this on.
- How?

51:25.760 --> 51:28.064
- Live long and prosper!
- What?

51:28.130 --> 51:30.699
Like this! Cover us!

51:32.401 --> 51:33.702
Look out behind you!

51:36.973 --> 51:38.007
Incoming!

51:38.074 --> 51:39.541
Bob, come on, I need power.
Now!

51:40.542 --> 51:41.843
I'm ready to go, here.

51:42.711 --> 51:44.479
You got it, you got it!

51:50.920 --> 51:56.092
Whoo!

51:56.158 --> 51:57.393
Splat!

51:57.460 --> 51:59.061
Woo!

52:01.563 --> 52:03.966
- It worked!
- You got it.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.669
Oh!

52:07.736 --> 52:09.537
You had that thing
this whole time?

52:09.604 --> 52:11.873
All right, Matteo, back off.

52:11.941 --> 52:13.541
We're vulnerable out here.

52:13.608 --> 52:14.877
- No shit.
- Hey.

52:14.944 --> 52:16.245
Don't you get it, Bob?

52:18.347 --> 52:20.349
We're the ants. Us.

52:20.416 --> 52:21.984
Okay.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.062
Glad to see you're
all right, sir.

52:33.129 --> 52:34.163
Where we at?

52:34.230 --> 52:36.298
Well, Mayweather
started the mission clock

52:36.365 --> 52:38.200
when you went MIA this morning.

52:38.267 --> 52:40.869
We're halfway to Helion
with two tangos down.

52:40.936 --> 52:44.106
That crash site secured,
well, what's left of it anyway.

52:44.173 --> 52:46.008
I thought we were dealing
with one of these monsters,

52:46.075 --> 52:46.976
but three?

52:47.043 --> 52:48.576
There's another one out there.

52:48.643 --> 52:52.348
It got King and Sams,
and it's growing.

52:52.415 --> 52:55.217
Every time it eats it gets
bigger, and this thing's hungry.

52:55.284 --> 52:57.752
Considering how fast
it got to Dale's camp,

52:57.819 --> 52:59.788
it could be anywhere by now.

52:59.854 --> 53:02.124
What do you suggest?

53:02.191 --> 53:03.993
Well, Bob was
able to deactivate

53:04.060 --> 53:05.794
whatever was
jamming the signals.

53:05.860 --> 53:07.496
I just touched it,
I'm sorry.

53:07.562 --> 53:08.663
It's not your fault, Bob.

53:08.730 --> 53:09.965
At least when the ship blew up

53:10.032 --> 53:11.833
it took the
signal jammer with it.

53:11.901 --> 53:13.335
If it's as big as you say it is,
we can use the satellites

53:13.402 --> 53:15.204
to scan the surrounding
areas and track it.

53:15.271 --> 53:18.807
Oh, no, that's a negative.
It travels underground.

53:18.873 --> 53:20.376
There has to be a
way to find it.

53:20.443 --> 53:22.577
Listen, this thing
shrugged off standard fire,

53:22.644 --> 53:25.680
a whole belt full of ordnance.

53:25.747 --> 53:26.681
You got anything in
your collection

53:26.748 --> 53:29.018
with a little more kick?

53:29.085 --> 53:32.555
Everything that I had
that worked was in the van.

53:32.620 --> 53:36.992
That giant smashed everything
trying to get inside.

53:37.059 --> 53:39.495
But if I can get that back
to the lab, I...

53:39.562 --> 53:40.896
I can get something
for you, yeah.

53:44.433 --> 53:46.335
Matteo...

53:47.669 --> 53:49.138
Anything to add?

53:52.908 --> 53:55.610
Bendis and Roman are dead.

53:55.677 --> 53:57.179
Who's gonna be next, Shep?

54:01.951 --> 54:03.252
Let's make it count then.

54:06.388 --> 54:08.857
Okay, let's load up.
We're RTB in five.

54:10.692 --> 54:14.662
But first, show me the spaceship
I've heard so much about.

54:30.346 --> 54:33.415
How can we be sure there's
nothing left in there?

54:34.950 --> 54:36.851
Bob said he saw
three compartments.

54:36.919 --> 54:38.921
He said they looked
like holding cells.

54:38.988 --> 54:42.690
Could be breeding chambers,
cryogenic pods.

54:42.757 --> 54:44.126
This could be a zoo
for all we know.

54:44.193 --> 54:46.028
The big one didn't
come out until Bob

54:46.095 --> 54:49.298
disabled the power to the ship,
like it was being held somehow.

54:49.365 --> 54:51.600
This could be some kind
of containment vessel.

54:51.666 --> 54:55.670
You think something rounded them
out and shot them into space?

54:55.737 --> 54:57.072
Possibly.

54:59.841 --> 55:01.843
You see that blue oily
stuff over there?

55:01.911 --> 55:04.947
That was on Dale's trailer
and on the truck.

55:05.014 --> 55:08.517
Everywhere that oily son
of a bitch goes, that stuff.

55:08.584 --> 55:10.052
That's how we track this thing.

55:10.119 --> 55:11.921
If this thing is leaving
this stuff behind,

55:11.987 --> 55:13.688
all I need to do is get
a sample back to the lab

55:13.755 --> 55:15.324
for analysis and upload
it to Mayweather.

55:15.391 --> 55:17.626
I just need to tell them
what they're looking for

55:17.692 --> 55:19.195
Now that we have
the satellites back,

55:19.261 --> 55:21.630
we can use every one of
them to track it.

55:21.696 --> 55:23.165
Well, let's get back to the lab.

55:25.867 --> 55:27.735
Come on, Specialist.

55:30.239 --> 55:32.541
Sir...

55:32.608 --> 55:35.511
We're getting really
close to mission failure,

55:35.578 --> 55:39.548
which means we won't have
time to clear the Helion blast.

55:39.615 --> 55:41.517
We're not gonna let that happen.

55:41.584 --> 55:46.322
Listen, Sams injured it, and if
he injured it, we can kill it.

55:46.388 --> 55:47.489
We just have to find it.

55:51.994 --> 55:53.329
All right, move out!

56:18.354 --> 56:20.589
I want Mayweather
to hear your prison theory.

56:20.656 --> 56:22.992
Maybe he'll kick it over
to Xenoanthropology,

56:23.058 --> 56:25.160
see if it tracks with any
of the known ETs.

56:25.227 --> 56:26.929
Would that delay
the Helion Measure?

56:26.996 --> 56:29.098
Possibly.
We'll try.

56:29.164 --> 56:32.368
But either way we still need
to track this thing down now.

56:32.434 --> 56:33.936
I just need
access to the lab and

56:34.003 --> 56:35.504
enough processing power
to recalibrate

56:35.571 --> 56:37.139
the ADU's satellite network.

56:37.206 --> 56:39.108
If I can get this cell
wired to the base grid,

56:39.174 --> 56:40.442
we'll have all
the power we need.

56:40.509 --> 56:42.177
All I want to hear
is that

56:42.244 --> 56:43.746
your weapons are
gonna work, Bob.

56:43.811 --> 56:45.881
After a day
like today,

56:45.948 --> 56:47.316
retirement doesn't look so bad.

56:50.852 --> 56:56.158
Shepherd, did
the aliens say anything?

56:59.728 --> 57:02.231
They did not.

57:02.298 --> 57:04.033
Hmm.

57:04.099 --> 57:05.634
Well, I think
it's clear that this

57:05.701 --> 57:07.869
isn't a matter of translation.

57:07.936 --> 57:09.772
<i>This is a matter of war.</i>

57:09.837 --> 57:11.674
<i>Shepherd, I'm glad to
see you're all right.</i>

57:11.740 --> 57:13.709
I'm sorry I can't say
the same for the...

57:13.776 --> 57:16.178
the men you lost today, but
we don't have time to mourn.

57:16.245 --> 57:18.747
We're about to begin
a very costly evacuation

57:18.813 --> 57:21.717
of the surrounding area.

57:21.784 --> 57:24.420
<i>Have you contained the threat?</i>

57:24.486 --> 57:27.723
We have not, sir.

57:27.790 --> 57:31.727
You need to do that, now.

57:31.794 --> 57:33.228
Sir, we're doing
everything we can.

57:33.295 --> 57:35.164
Specialist Fairchild
is working on a way

57:35.230 --> 57:37.766
of tracking the last
remaining alien target.

57:37.865 --> 57:39.101
Send analysis and
calibrate the satellites

57:39.168 --> 57:40.602
for new search parameters.

57:45.307 --> 57:48.277
Bob has a working alien arsenal
thanks to a power supply

57:48.344 --> 57:50.212
that he recovered
from the crash site.

57:54.983 --> 57:56.385
We know we can hurt it.

57:56.452 --> 57:57.920
Display progress.

57:57.986 --> 57:59.988
Soon we'll be able to find it.

58:14.503 --> 58:17.740
The way I see it, there's still
four of us and one of them.

58:17.806 --> 58:20.142
I don't see it like that.
I see you have to do it.

58:20.209 --> 58:21.410
Now.

58:21.477 --> 58:22.644
We'll kill it.

58:30.319 --> 58:32.654
Shepherd, Shepherd, do you copy?

58:41.530 --> 58:43.031
Shepherd?

58:46.368 --> 58:48.203
Ah!

58:50.038 --> 58:53.108
I assure you, my team has
everything under control.

58:57.045 --> 58:58.981
Shep...

59:08.357 --> 59:10.325
Oh, sorry!

59:12.428 --> 59:13.897
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

59:13.962 --> 59:15.364
That was me.

59:15.431 --> 59:17.599
It's coming right back up,
I promise.

59:27.843 --> 59:29.178
Bob.

01:00:02.611 --> 01:00:05.414
If anyone can hear me,
it's already here.

01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:09.117
Oh, shit.

01:00:20.062 --> 01:00:21.363
Shit!

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:22.431
Matteo?

01:00:23.967 --> 01:00:25.367
Matteo!

01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:30.539
Ah! No!

01:00:31.406 --> 01:00:34.476
Oh! Matteo's dead.

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:36.211
I repeat, Matteo is dead!
The alien is in the compound!

01:00:39.448 --> 01:00:40.382
Oh, God...

01:00:50.659 --> 01:00:52.828
Confirm that last.

01:00:52.896 --> 01:00:56.498
Bob? I didn't copy.
Where's the god damn power?

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:58.400
Working on it!

01:00:58.467 --> 01:01:00.235
Come on!

01:01:00.302 --> 01:01:04.606
Okay, this one,
this is the one!

01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:06.608
Okay.

01:01:06.675 --> 01:01:08.176
Okay, okay, okay.

01:01:13.649 --> 01:01:16.351
Watch your heads, it got
through the ceiling vent!

01:01:24.493 --> 01:01:25.594
Guys...

01:01:28.031 --> 01:01:31.600
Please... it's just me, okay?

01:02:01.998 --> 01:02:06.301
<i>Come in, anyone!
What's going on out there?</i>

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:13.642
Hello?

01:02:20.248 --> 01:02:23.251
Come in, I need a status update!

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:41.938
Shepherd, what the hell's
going on over there?

01:02:42.005 --> 01:02:44.974
Uh, we're having a
little power issue, sir.

01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:46.808
Shepherd, it's here!

01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:48.644
Shepherd, have you located
the alien threat?

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:51.047
Sir, we have a twenty
on the target.

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:53.215
Gonna have to call you back.

01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:54.449
Shepherd!

01:02:54.516 --> 01:02:57.552
- Where?
- It's in the lab.

01:02:57.619 --> 01:03:00.188
Good.
We're gonna keep it there.

01:03:00.255 --> 01:03:01.523
We'll trap it.

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.059
Do you have any
explosive ordnance?

01:03:03.126 --> 01:03:05.160
I... I can think of
something, yeah.

01:03:05.227 --> 01:03:07.930
Shepherd,
Fairchild's in the lab.

01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:12.367
Well, we'll have
to get her out then.

01:03:49.105 --> 01:03:50.907
These'll do the trick for sure.

01:03:52.909 --> 01:03:55.610
Shepherd for Fairchild.

01:03:58.014 --> 01:04:00.315
<i>Listen, we're gonna
blow the lab.</i>

01:04:04.519 --> 01:04:05.922
Get out if you can.

01:04:12.995 --> 01:04:16.933
Bob...

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:19.434
we either do this now,
or we don't do this at all.

01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:23.906
If we don't give
Mayweather a call back

01:04:23.973 --> 01:04:26.909
and give him the all clear,
he's gonna launch that nuke.

01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:33.415
Look, we're gonna try to
get Fairchild out of there.

01:04:33.482 --> 01:04:36.785
Hey, but if we have to choose,

01:04:36.852 --> 01:04:38.921
it's the charges at all cost.

01:04:38.988 --> 01:04:40.789
All right, buddy?

01:04:40.856 --> 01:04:42.491
We're gonna take that thing out,
but we may have to go with it.

01:04:44.259 --> 01:04:45.660
Do you understand?

01:04:45.727 --> 01:04:47.729
Yeah.

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:51.500
I should've stayed in
my hole under the ground.

01:04:51.566 --> 01:04:53.301
Careful what you wish for.

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.651
Oh, shit.

01:05:12.255 --> 01:05:13.855
It's in the morgue.

01:05:16.159 --> 01:05:17.726
<i>Do you copy?
It's in the morgue.</i>

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.464
You got it?

01:05:22.531 --> 01:05:23.665
Yeah, yeah.
Got it, got it, got it.

01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:03.072
Go. Go.

01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:04.539
Okay.

01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:08.543
Oh, God.
Oh my God.

01:06:12.315 --> 01:06:13.916
Ah!

01:06:15.318 --> 01:06:16.852
Shepherd!

01:06:16.919 --> 01:06:18.753
It's in the morgue,
it's in the morgue!

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.125
No, it's not!

01:06:23.192 --> 01:06:24.894
Move!

01:06:29.265 --> 01:06:30.532
Bob!

01:06:30.599 --> 01:06:32.667
I love you badass, Bob!

01:06:32.734 --> 01:06:34.603
Take the charge.
I'll cover you, hurry!

01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:38.473
It's still alive!

01:06:41.509 --> 01:06:42.945
Not for long!

01:06:43.012 --> 01:06:45.580
Go! Go! Go!

01:06:58.327 --> 01:06:59.661
Call Mayweather.

01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:01.830
He's already trying to call us.

01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:03.632
<i>There's a massive target
in your airspace!</i>

01:07:03.698 --> 01:07:05.500
<i>I'm sending in the
Air Force to support.</i>

01:07:13.842 --> 01:07:16.411
Oh, God.

01:07:16.478 --> 01:07:18.480
Now, what?

01:07:18.546 --> 01:07:20.917
<i>Command, we are on
approach to the alien craft.</i>

01:07:20.983 --> 01:07:23.019
<i>Stay frosty
up there, airmen,</i>

01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:25.054
<i>these slimy sons of bitches
dropped a boatload of monsters</i>

01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:26.956
<i>on us today so they're
not here to ask for sugar.</i>

01:07:27.023 --> 01:07:29.125
<i>I need full sensors
on that saucer.</i>

01:07:29.191 --> 01:07:32.395
<i>Send everything you get
to our team on the ground.</i>

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.529
<i>Roger that, going for
a closer look.</i>

01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:41.503
<i>Jesus, look at
the size of that thing!</i>

01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:43.571
<i>Sensors active.</i>

01:07:46.508 --> 01:07:47.977
<i>Signal live!</i>

01:07:51.013 --> 01:07:53.715
I'm picking up all kinds
of readings from that ship.

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:56.118
It's scanning.

01:07:56.185 --> 01:07:59.521
It's looking for
the crashed ship.

01:07:59.587 --> 01:08:01.523
I thought they sent it here.

01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:03.159
Think about it.

01:08:03.225 --> 01:08:04.894
All the monsters we faced today,

01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:08.230
that isn't what you expect
from an intelligent species.

01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:09.631
If they wanted to kill us,

01:08:09.698 --> 01:08:11.833
they would've done
it a long time ago.

01:08:11.901 --> 01:08:16.504
That crashed ship was not
an attack, it was a prison...

01:08:16.571 --> 01:08:18.707
a prison for aliens
so dangerous

01:08:18.773 --> 01:08:20.675
they were rounded up
and launched into space.

01:08:20.742 --> 01:08:23.245
It was never
supposed to land here.

01:08:23.312 --> 01:08:24.845
What's it doing here now?

01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:28.317
The same thing we're doing.

01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:29.952
Containment.

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:31.953
It's their version
of the Helion Measure!

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.688
But we killed all the aliens!

01:08:33.755 --> 01:08:35.590
Well, maybe we missed one?

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.533
You hear that?

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.270
It's gathering energy.

01:08:48.337 --> 01:08:49.604
It's charging.

01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:50.973
Charging what?

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.707
Isn't it obvious?
It's a weapon.

01:08:59.415 --> 01:09:00.749
<i>Target is hostile!</i>

01:09:00.814 --> 01:09:02.649
<i>Repeat!
Target is hostile!</i>

01:09:05.453 --> 01:09:07.622
Oh, my God, Bob's right.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:09.158
These power readings are
off the charts.

01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:11.359
If the Air Force doesn't
take down the mothership

01:09:11.426 --> 01:09:13.795
before it charges up, it could
destroy the whole planet.

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:15.863
You're telling me they're
the most advanced minds

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.599
in the universe,
and they're gonna come here

01:09:17.665 --> 01:09:21.970
and blow us up for
their mistake?

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:27.410
This is your mess and
we're cleaning it up!

01:09:27.475 --> 01:09:29.743
Sir, the mothership has
engaged the Air Force.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.281
We're losing pilots.

01:09:32.348 --> 01:09:34.283
Mora, if I asked you to
take an alien craft

01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:36.551
and go get Shepherd and
his team to safety,

01:09:36.618 --> 01:09:40.256
maybe even kick these ETs in
their ass while you're at it,

01:09:40.322 --> 01:09:41.622
how fast could you get there?

01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:43.091
Extremely fast, sir.

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:44.559
Good. Do it.

01:09:44.626 --> 01:09:46.861
Get our people to safety,
if you can.

01:09:49.965 --> 01:09:52.634
<i>Multiple targets inbound,
weapons hot!</i>

01:10:04.813 --> 01:10:06.949
What do you want from us?

01:10:09.818 --> 01:10:12.154
Shepherd, come in.

01:10:13.655 --> 01:10:14.957
Colonel, sir.

01:10:15.024 --> 01:10:16.691
<i>We have a new threat.</i>

01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.294
<i>I'm aware.</i>

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.162
<i>I just sent evac coordinates
to Fairchild.</i>

01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:22.597
<i>You need to get there now.
You're done there.</i>

01:10:22.664 --> 01:10:23.966
Negative, sir.

01:10:25.767 --> 01:10:27.436
I'm sorry, Shepherd.

01:10:27.503 --> 01:10:29.038
<i>You did everything you could.</i>

01:10:29.105 --> 01:10:30.906
<i>There's no fighting that thing.</i>

01:10:36.045 --> 01:10:38.813
There's only one
option left now.

01:10:41.683 --> 01:10:44.386
We're targeting the craft.

01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:45.620
Mayweather!

01:10:46.855 --> 01:10:49.624
Five minutes to Helion impact.

01:10:49.691 --> 01:10:50.993
Mayweather!

01:11:02.605 --> 01:11:04.306
He launched the nuke.

01:11:04.373 --> 01:11:08.577
He's got EVAC waiting for us,
but...

01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:11.480
we've got five minutes.

01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:14.116
Time to move.

01:11:14.183 --> 01:11:15.918
Everybody's
answer to everything.

01:11:15.985 --> 01:11:19.088
Nuke it. Nuke it.
Just nuke it.

01:11:19.155 --> 01:11:20.688
You know what?

01:11:20.755 --> 01:11:22.591
They mastered
interstellar travel

01:11:22.657 --> 01:11:25.194
and you know what
we just fired at it?

01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:26.495
A firecracker.

01:11:26.562 --> 01:11:28.497
Listen, smart boy, it's over.

01:11:28.564 --> 01:11:30.698
It's time to go!

01:11:31.967 --> 01:11:33.969
At least it's gonna be
a hell of a show.

01:11:34.036 --> 01:11:35.437
I promise you it's not.

01:11:35.504 --> 01:11:38.974
Bob. Wait, what do you
mean "it's not"?

01:11:39.041 --> 01:11:40.376
Okay.

01:11:42.378 --> 01:11:45.747
<i>Abort! Abort!
Helion is in bound.</i>

01:11:45.813 --> 01:11:49.351
<i>I repeat, abort!
Get out of there! Now!</i>

01:11:56.659 --> 01:11:59.195
Bob!
We need to go now.

01:11:59.261 --> 01:12:00.663
I'm telling you,
it won't matter!

01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:02.031
What do you mean?

01:12:02.097 --> 01:12:03.765
That nuke might as well
be a paper plane

01:12:03.831 --> 01:12:05.501
when it hits the shields
of that ship.

01:12:05.568 --> 01:12:08.170
If we leave now, we'll still be
dead when that mothership fires,

01:12:08.237 --> 01:12:10.973
along with everyone on Earth!

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.474
How do you know this?

01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:15.311
I'm an expert!

01:12:15.377 --> 01:12:16.478
I'm the expert.

01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:17.880
I've studied every single ship

01:12:17.947 --> 01:12:19.481
that's found its way
to our planet.

01:12:19.548 --> 01:12:20.616
'51 was the first time they
showed up after Roswell.

01:12:20.683 --> 01:12:21.917
No aggression.

01:12:21.984 --> 01:12:23.652
They just wanted their
pilot back,

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.554
but they sure were scared of us
and we already had the nuke!

01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.056
In'77 shots were fired at us,

01:12:27.122 --> 01:12:28.557
but we never landed
a hit on them.

01:12:28.624 --> 01:12:31.360
We didn't know it then,
but same thing: shields.

01:12:31.427 --> 01:12:35.064
'82 it was a crash landing
because the gravity well failed.

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:38.133
Shepherd, you have
to trust me on this.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.069
I mean, it's one thing
to nuke a single alien

01:12:40.135 --> 01:12:41.470
down here on the ground, right?

01:12:41.537 --> 01:12:44.607
But that missile,
it won't even penetrate

01:12:44.673 --> 01:12:46.308
the shields of that mothership.

01:12:49.744 --> 01:12:52.814
Unless... unless we can fix it.

01:12:53.815 --> 01:12:55.184
How?

01:12:55.251 --> 01:12:57.419
You see the size of
that thing, right?

01:12:57.486 --> 01:12:58.954
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:12:59.021 --> 01:13:00.755
The only way it can maintain
its structural integrity

01:13:00.822 --> 01:13:02.658
in our atmosphere
is anti-gravity.

01:13:02.725 --> 01:13:07.496
The same as the Roswell craft,
the same as every other craft.

01:13:07.563 --> 01:13:09.665
And the same as the gauntlet.

01:13:09.732 --> 01:13:11.700
Shepherd, I have a plan.

01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:13.469
Two birds, one stone.

01:13:13.535 --> 01:13:16.771
Every one of those ships, it...
it manipulates, it...

01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:18.641
it bends gravity
around it, right?

01:13:18.707 --> 01:13:21.944
And it generates a
gravity well underneath it.

01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:24.013
It's the weak spot.

01:13:24.079 --> 01:13:26.615
Call Mayweather back, now!
Call Mayweather back!

01:13:26.682 --> 01:13:27.716
Tell him to change the target.

01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:29.451
The base, not the ship!

01:13:29.518 --> 01:13:31.754
We'll redirect it
right up the gravity well.

01:13:31.819 --> 01:13:35.691
How the hell are we gonna
redirect a nuke from down here?

01:13:35.758 --> 01:13:36.791
We're gonna catch it!

01:13:36.858 --> 01:13:38.227
How?

01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:40.896
I'll tell you how.
I'll tell you.

01:13:43.098 --> 01:13:45.134
With that and with this.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.069
The only way to make sure
we destroy that ship

01:13:47.136 --> 01:13:50.973
is if we use the gravity
gauntlet from below it.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.375
But we have to stay here!

01:13:53.442 --> 01:13:56.912
Oh my God, Bob,
I hope you're right.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.381
Shepherd to Mayweather.

01:13:59.448 --> 01:14:01.884
Shepherd, did you get
your team out of there?

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.686
That's a negative, sir.

01:14:03.752 --> 01:14:05.421
<i>You need to get out of there.</i>

01:14:05.487 --> 01:14:08.157
He's right, Shepherd,
it's now or never!

01:14:08.223 --> 01:14:10.825
Shepherd, you need to
get out of there now!

01:14:10.893 --> 01:14:12.728
Shepherd, it's
already too late!

01:14:12.795 --> 01:14:14.063
You gotta go!

01:14:14.129 --> 01:14:15.764
We have it on good
authority this nuke

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:17.733
is not gonna eliminate
the threat.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.535
What authority?

01:14:19.601 --> 01:14:21.303
Science!

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:23.772
The only one we've got
that knows anything

01:14:23.838 --> 01:14:25.174
about alien technology.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.675
We need you
to redirect the Helion,

01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:28.477
target the base not the ship.

01:14:28.544 --> 01:14:30.079
You... you want it to miss?

01:14:30.145 --> 01:14:34.683
No, no. We want it to hit,
but my team has a plan.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.053
We're gonna... we're gonna
redirect the shot.

01:14:40.556 --> 01:14:42.758
Please, sir, you have
to trust us.

01:14:42.825 --> 01:14:44.960
<i>The only way
to make sure we kill that ship</i>

01:14:45.027 --> 01:14:46.428
<i>is to hit it from below.</i>

01:14:46.495 --> 01:14:48.497
We were able to test
the method earlier.

01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:51.700
We have an alien weapon
that will work, we just...

01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:55.971
we've gotta stay down here
to redirect the nuke.

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:01.143
Colonel?

01:15:02.678 --> 01:15:04.113
Sir?

01:15:04.179 --> 01:15:07.082
Shepherd, if I do this...

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.222
there's no going back.

01:15:13.288 --> 01:15:15.724
You understand that, right?

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:16.925
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

01:15:19.395 --> 01:15:23.532
Are you sure?

01:15:26.135 --> 01:15:28.437
Yes, sir, I am sure.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.676
Changing the missile
trajectory now.

01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:37.312
See you in five.

01:15:49.658 --> 01:15:51.960
We're gonna give
those three-fingered freaks

01:15:52.027 --> 01:15:54.463
a taste of their own medicine.

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:57.065
We're gonna give them
a spanking with gravity,

01:15:57.132 --> 01:16:02.671
and we're gonna show them you
do not blast the planet Earth!

01:16:02.738 --> 01:16:04.473
- Bob, no!
- Bob!

01:16:09.478 --> 01:16:11.146
It's heading into the warehouse!

01:16:11.213 --> 01:16:13.949
It's gotta go back
into the dark.

01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:15.484
Well, at least it's contained.

01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:17.119
For now.

01:16:17.186 --> 01:16:19.321
Shepherd, we need the
power supply that thing

01:16:19.388 --> 01:16:22.624
just swallowed in order to
make the gauntlet work.

01:16:22.691 --> 01:16:24.193
Let's go get it.

01:16:34.203 --> 01:16:36.071
Does that thing work?

01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:38.040
It needs power.

01:16:38.106 --> 01:16:39.508
I could run a line
from the grid.

01:16:39.575 --> 01:16:40.676
Go get it.

01:16:45.214 --> 01:16:47.816
Oh, shit.
I'll distract him.

01:16:47.884 --> 01:16:50.887
Hey! Hey!

01:16:50.954 --> 01:16:51.987
Go.

01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:54.924
Hey!
Hey, over here!

01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:56.458
Hey!

01:17:02.899 --> 01:17:04.233
Ugh.

01:17:13.609 --> 01:17:15.377
Where is it, Bob?

01:17:33.695 --> 01:17:35.564
Oh!

01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:42.137
Oh, shit.

01:17:43.006 --> 01:17:44.640
Hey, Stella!

01:17:46.642 --> 01:17:47.911
Shepherd!

01:17:47.977 --> 01:17:50.512
Hold on! Shepherd!

01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:55.784
Hey! Hey!

01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:58.153
Hey! Hey!
You hungry?

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.958
Hungry?

01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:03.325
Eat this!

01:18:14.169 --> 01:18:15.571
Shepherd, are you okay?

01:18:15.637 --> 01:18:17.072
- Oh, God
- Shepherd, are you okay?

01:18:17.139 --> 01:18:18.173
You okay?

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.608
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:20.910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:20.977 --> 01:18:22.244
The nuke's coming, Shepherd.

01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:24.914
The nuke's coming.

01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:26.114
Look!

01:18:30.085 --> 01:18:31.620
Oh, my God.

01:18:40.562 --> 01:18:42.564
Is that what I think it is?

01:18:42.631 --> 01:18:44.099
The power cell.

01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:45.300
Okay, Bob.

01:18:48.037 --> 01:18:49.304
This one's for you.

01:18:50.839 --> 01:18:52.641
Ah!

01:18:59.681 --> 01:19:00.816
Gah! I got it!

01:19:00.883 --> 01:19:02.584
They're shooting at the nuke!
Hurry!

01:19:02.651 --> 01:19:04.586
I don't got it,
I need help!

01:19:07.522 --> 01:19:08.891
<i>Scramble! Scramble!</i>

01:19:08.958 --> 01:19:10.459
<i>Negative, airmen!</i>

01:19:10.525 --> 01:19:13.161
<i>New orders are protect
that nuke at all costs!</i>

01:19:14.897 --> 01:19:17.866
Come on, Shepherd!
That ship's about to fire!

01:19:17.934 --> 01:19:20.535
Okay.

01:19:20.602 --> 01:19:22.571
How are we supposed
to fight these things?

01:19:22.638 --> 01:19:25.407
We've got one of their ships!
Just keep them off that bomb!

01:19:27.376 --> 01:19:28.777
<i>Got a bogie on the payload!</i>

01:19:28.844 --> 01:19:30.980
<i>Keep 'em off me!</i>

01:19:31.047 --> 01:19:32.381
<i>Got one!
You're clear!</i>

01:19:32.447 --> 01:19:35.484
<i>Firing on target!</i>

01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:39.488
<i>Mora to ground team,
you're all clear up here.</i>

01:19:39.554 --> 01:19:40.756
<i>Go ahead and say hi!</i>

01:20:15.657 --> 01:20:17.392
It worked.

01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:20.495
Oh, Bob, it worked!

01:20:24.299 --> 01:20:26.735
Oh, man.

01:20:26.802 --> 01:20:29.105
Oh, whoo!

01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:31.941
Whoo!

01:20:32.008 --> 01:20:33.475
Let's get out of here.

01:20:36.012 --> 01:20:37.412
Oh.

01:21:06.142 --> 01:21:07.442
Wow.

01:21:17.319 --> 01:21:18.955
- Bob!
- Bob?

01:21:19.021 --> 01:21:20.789
Big idiot forgot to chew.

01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:25.527
I've been digested.

01:21:30.265 --> 01:21:32.634
And almost disintegrated.

01:21:34.703 --> 01:21:36.872
Bob, your plan worked.

01:21:38.975 --> 01:21:39.942
Imagine that.

01:21:42.245 --> 01:21:44.080
Mayweather's gonna be pissed.

01:21:44.147 --> 01:21:47.716
No. Why would he be pissed?
You just saved the planet.

01:21:47.783 --> 01:21:50.352
You think we're gonna
get any more funding?

01:21:50.418 --> 01:21:52.687
We have to for next time.

01:21:52.754 --> 01:21:54.456
If this is what they do
for a missing ship,

01:21:54.523 --> 01:21:56.092
imagine what happens next.

01:21:56.159 --> 01:21:58.727
Oh, God, I don't want to.
I don't want to imagine.

01:21:58.794 --> 01:22:00.462
Yeah. Well, unfortunately
it's our job

01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:02.198
to imagine what happens next,

01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:05.101
and to be better
prepared for it

01:22:05.168 --> 01:22:09.838
because I'm never
leaving my workshop again.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.943
Not bad for day one.

01:22:19.115 --> 01:22:20.348
Come in peace...

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:24.519
or go in pieces!

01:22:26.989 --> 01:22:29.858
Hey!

01:22:29.926 --> 01:22:32.161
Hell of a welcoming
party here, Shepherd.

01:22:32.228 --> 01:22:33.562
Nice shot, too.

01:22:33.628 --> 01:22:35.730
- How you doing over there?
- Doing swell.

01:22:40.236 --> 01:22:41.904
How'd you get here so fast?

01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:45.407
Well, after you hit
the bull's-eye, I, uh,

01:22:45.473 --> 01:22:47.409
hopped a flight here with,
uh, Agent Mora.

01:22:47.475 --> 01:22:49.578
She was, uh, nice enough
to kind of let me hop on

01:22:49.644 --> 01:22:51.147
the fastest ship we got
in the galaxy.

01:22:51.214 --> 01:22:54.183
I know that ship!
It's the Roswell craft!

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:57.385
Wait, that's my ship.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.024
That's the government's ship,
asshole,

01:23:02.091 --> 01:23:05.261
but if you ask real nice,
I think Agent Mora here

01:23:05.328 --> 01:23:07.897
just might, you know,
give you a spin.

01:23:09.065 --> 01:23:12.335
Hey, Fairchild,
I'm very impressed.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.006
Nice job, and I can't wait
to have you take over here.

01:23:17.073 --> 01:23:18.107
Yeah.

01:23:18.174 --> 01:23:20.076
Hey, Shepherd?

01:23:20.142 --> 01:23:21.543
Yes, sir?

01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.511
I said a welcoming party,

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.682
not a retirement party.

01:23:29.151 --> 01:23:30.086
Look around you.

01:23:32.054 --> 01:23:33.455
You got it, sir.

01:23:34.756 --> 01:23:36.225
This is gonna be nice.

01:23:36.292 --> 01:23:38.593
I got a feeling we're
gonna be here for awhile.

01:23:47.736 --> 01:23:49.437
We're gonna be here for awhile.
