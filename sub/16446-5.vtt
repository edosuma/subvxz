00:02.859 --> 00:04.413
So, we're still good
to be roomies, right?

00:04.438 --> 00:05.656
What are you talking about, roomies?

00:05.719 --> 00:06.768
We shook on it.

00:06.853 --> 00:09.220
You shall remain right here,

00:09.272 --> 00:11.222
on Earth, amongst the creatures

00:11.274 --> 00:12.223
you so despise.

00:12.275 --> 00:13.808
Existing in this punishment

00:13.894 --> 00:16.394
allows me to be closer to my family.

00:16.479 --> 00:18.146
You made a deal to return Mom to Hell.

00:18.231 --> 00:21.065
In exchange, Chloe's life was spared.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.400
You still haven't delivered

00:22.452 --> 00:23.568
on your end of the bargain.

00:23.653 --> 00:24.702
If you're so concerned,

00:24.738 --> 00:26.571
why don't you just fly Mum back to Hell?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.851
Send your mom back to Hell.

08:39.903 --> 08:40.684
- (chuckles)
- A solution

08:40.738 --> 08:41.736
which you

08:41.822 --> 08:43.522
will, no doubt, avoid.

08:43.573 --> 08:45.440
Well, worry not, my
little sex thug, because

08:45.526 --> 08:47.659
Uriel won't be a problem.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.077
We have a nuclear weapon.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.113
What's that?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.414
You.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.032
Well, Uriel doesn't know that

08:54.084 --> 08:55.333
we're working together on this.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.752
We all know he won't listen to me.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.538
But he will if it's someone
from the home team.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.257
So, you will go and convince him

09:02.342 --> 09:03.759
that he needs to go back.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.378
Or, you know, just punch
him in his smug face.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.596
Dealer's choice.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.680
(chuckling)

09:08.715 --> 09:10.048
God, it's nice

09:10.100 --> 09:12.217
having a super powerful angel
on your side, isn't it?

09:14.104 --> 09:15.687
Good luck with that.

09:19.109 --> 09:21.026
CHLOE: Huh.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.394
Saved your life.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.312
(chuckling): Maybe. You never know.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.397
What are you talking about?

09:25.482 --> 09:26.398
Well, it appears

09:26.483 --> 09:27.616
that I was correct this morning.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.402
You are being targeted by cosmic forces.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.453
But fear not,

09:31.538 --> 09:32.737
it's all being dealt with.

09:32.823 --> 09:33.789
And I'm here.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.707
CHLOE: Now...

09:35.742 --> 09:37.075
what is with everyone

09:37.161 --> 09:38.410
and this car accident? I'm fine.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.628
No, I'm afraid that you're not.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.379
And so, for the next day or so,

09:41.415 --> 09:43.582
I'm gonna need you to be unpredictable.

09:43.634 --> 09:45.217
Whatever you'd normally
do, just, you know...

09:45.252 --> 09:46.918
ah, ah... do the opposite.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.170
Too bad.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.921
I was totally gonna have
sex with you today.

09:49.973 --> 09:52.390
Really?

09:52.426 --> 09:55.227
Oh. Well played, Detective. (chuckles)

09:55.262 --> 09:57.596
Yes, but until the threat has passed,

09:57.648 --> 09:58.814
just to be safe,

09:58.899 --> 10:00.098
I won't be leaving your side.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.733
So just think of me

10:01.768 --> 10:03.485
as your Guardian Devil.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.270
(softly): Okay.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.271
Guys, Wesley Cabot's dead.

10:06.323 --> 10:07.439
I can't believe it.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.990
Oh, God. Not you, too.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.276
Oh, man. Body Bags 1 through 6.

10:11.328 --> 10:13.111
First in line. I mean,
I even skipped out

10:13.197 --> 10:15.413
on some of our wedding planning
to see Body Bags 6. Remember?

10:15.449 --> 10:16.832
That was the big emergency?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.783
It was totally worth it.
It was a great movie.

10:18.836 --> 10:20.452
Yes, it was. Better catch
phrase, wasn't it?

10:20.504 --> 10:21.786
BOTH: "Not on my watch."

10:21.872 --> 10:22.787
(both chuckling)

10:22.873 --> 10:24.206
Maybe I should get a catch phrase.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.124
You don't need a catch phrase. And you.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.126
Do you have anything
constructive to add?

10:28.178 --> 10:30.795
Uh, yep. Yep, I do.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.465
The boy who, uh, found the body

10:33.517 --> 10:35.967
remembered the first three plate
numbers of the getaway car.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.435
13 matches.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.854
13. That's a lot of legwork.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.472
Jamie Lee Adrienne.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.107
The, uh, the Playmate?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.275
- The ex-party girl?
- Yeah.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.726
What does she have to
do with Wesley Cabot?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.978
She's his ex-wife. They met
on the set of Body Bags 4.

10:47.030 --> 10:48.780
Apparently, Jamie and
Wesley's divorce proceedings

10:48.815 --> 10:50.282
were very contentious.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.651
Maybe she went to "renegotiate."

10:52.736 --> 10:54.202
(Lucifer and Dan chuckling)

10:54.288 --> 10:55.787
By "renegotiate", I mean kill him.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.656
- Yeah.
- Uh...

10:59.042 --> 11:00.041
Yeah.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.713
I can't believe Wesley's really gone.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.665
When was the last time you saw Mr.
Cabot?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.885
Um... a few weeks ago.

11:09.970 --> 11:10.886
Maybe.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.254
Interesting.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.056
Then can you explain why a
witness said that they saw you

11:15.142 --> 11:17.342
speeding away from Wesley's
dojo this morning?

11:17.394 --> 11:20.896
Welcome to Devil Time.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.514
- What are you doing?
- Trying out my new catch phrase.

11:22.599 --> 11:23.765
"Welcome to Devil Time"?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.183
- What the hell does that mean?
- She knows what it means.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.568
I have no idea what that means.

11:26.653 --> 11:29.070
- Oh.
- Okay, yeah. I...

11:29.156 --> 11:30.739
I was at the dojo this morning.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.691
But it's not what you think.

11:32.743 --> 11:35.026
I went because of this...

11:35.112 --> 11:36.411
WESLEY (on voice mail):
My life is destroyed.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.079
And it all started with Body Bags 4.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.331
Call me back.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.950
What "started with Body Bags 4"?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.201
I have no idea.

11:43.253 --> 11:45.003
That's why I went to go see see Wesley.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.706
But he was already dead and...

11:47.758 --> 11:50.041
I panicked and then I ran...

11:50.093 --> 11:51.376
But I swear

11:51.428 --> 11:52.761
I would've never hurt Wesley.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.047
Even though we were divorced,
I really cared about him.

11:56.099 --> 11:57.882
Where were you at 7:00 a.m.
this morning?

11:57.935 --> 11:59.551
With Raphael.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.769
My Pilates instructor.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.221
And how does the Weaponizer
feel about all this?

12:03.307 --> 12:05.807
(whispering): Who the
hell is the Weaponizer?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.776
He's a character played
by Kimo Van Zandt,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.311
Wesley's co-star

12:09.396 --> 12:11.863
and her current husband.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.282
So you used to be married
to an action star,

12:14.368 --> 12:16.234
only to divorce him and marry

12:16.286 --> 12:18.119
another action star?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.038
Yeah. It was the '90s.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.456
We did a lot of coke.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.074
Well, how did your current husband feel

12:23.160 --> 12:24.409
about you visiting your ex?

12:24.494 --> 12:25.460
Oh, that's easy.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.128
Kimo and Wesley hated each other.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.246
Long-standing feud.

12:28.298 --> 12:29.798
God only knows what Kimo would've done

12:29.883 --> 12:31.249
if he knew I went to see him.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.751
Where was Kimo this morning?

12:32.803 --> 12:36.171
Uh, at ActionCon in Reno.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.555
Signing autographs.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.057
WESLEY: Where's my money, partner?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.476
I will end you!

12:41.561 --> 12:43.645
Without Body Bags 4,
you are nothing, man!

12:43.730 --> 12:46.564
How does Body Bags 4
figure into all this?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.401
Well, Wesley, our victim, uh,

12:49.436 --> 12:51.353
was the hero of the Body Bags franchise.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.487
Ooh, and in Body Bags 4,

12:52.572 --> 12:53.905
newcomer Kimo Van Zandt appeared.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.607
He played this shady CIA operative,

12:55.692 --> 12:56.941
who acted as Wesley's foil

12:56.994 --> 12:58.443
and his eventual ambiguous ally, but...

12:58.528 --> 13:00.412
Then Kimo's character got
spun off into his own,

13:00.447 --> 13:03.164
more successful franchise,
The Weaponizer.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.116
Personal fave: Weaponizer
4: The Last Arsenal.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.252
- So good, right?
- At the end, with the whole...

13:07.287 --> 13:09.170
- (both imitate explosion)
- Okay, I so regret asking you guys this.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.007
Although, you're oddly adorable.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.292
So, it seems like Kimo has always

13:14.378 --> 13:15.427
had it out for Wesley.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.962
Stole his wife, stole
his film franchise.

13:18.015 --> 13:19.798
So maybe he really did "end"
it for him once and for all.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.016
But Kimo was in Reno.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.884
At ActionCon.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.520
But that convention happens
the last week in August.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.605
- How do you know that?
- My mom used to go to it every year.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.940
- So Jamie's lying.
- Or Kimo's lying to her.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.692
Either way, we gotta find him.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.811
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- Okay.

13:34.364 --> 13:35.780
MOM: Please, hold on. Um...

13:35.816 --> 13:39.651
Again, I apologize that the
children were late for school.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.037
And, yes, I understand

13:42.122 --> 13:45.790
that pants need to be
worn every day, now.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.333
Ooh!

13:55.385 --> 13:57.669
Rough day?

13:57.721 --> 13:58.837
Oh...

13:58.889 --> 14:01.222
Since returning to my
employment, I have found

14:01.308 --> 14:04.476
the number of daily tasks to
be almost insurmountable.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.678
But hey...

14:06.730 --> 14:09.013
at least you're not here
to take me back to Hell.

14:12.602 --> 14:16.020
You are here to take me back to Hell?

14:16.073 --> 14:18.073
No, Mom, I'm not. I'm just...

14:18.158 --> 14:20.408
Listen, I was just wondering
if your being here

14:20.494 --> 14:22.694
is just postponing the inevitable.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.364
I mean, at some point...

14:26.450 --> 14:29.250
other siblings will come
down here looking for you.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.202
And I'll convince them to let me stay,

14:31.288 --> 14:32.921
just like I did you and Lucifer.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.540
You were gone for a
really long time, Mom.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.211
You might not know your children
as well as you think you do.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.882
You may be right.

14:43.934 --> 14:46.768
But, at least for now,

14:46.853 --> 14:48.303
I have you and Lucifer.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.055
My brave boys.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.192
So if I'm here on Earth

14:54.227 --> 14:56.694
for two more years...

14:56.730 --> 14:59.614
or two hours...

I no longer have my powers.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.326
Well, what happened to them?
Oh, I don't know, Luci,

26:35.411 --> 26:36.577
pick a sin.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.913
Is it because I released
a damned soul from Hell?

26:38.965 --> 26:41.749
Slept with a demon? Is it
because I'm working with you?

26:41.834 --> 26:43.584
Or because of Mom?

26:45.338 --> 26:48.756
Or am I simply no longer worthy?

26:50.092 --> 26:51.425
(sniffles)

26:51.477 --> 26:54.511
It's time that I faced
the truth, brother.

26:56.566 --> 26:59.266
I've fallen.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.356
Well.

27:05.441 --> 27:07.608
Welcome to the club.
Meetings are on Tuesdays.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.860
It's different for me, Luci.

27:09.946 --> 27:11.362
It's different.

27:11.447 --> 27:13.747
I no longer have my powers.

27:13.783 --> 27:15.199
My very strength...

27:15.284 --> 27:16.667
Big deal!

27:16.752 --> 27:19.620
It's probably the best thing
that ever happened to you.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.590
But right now I haven't got
time to hold your hand,

27:22.625 --> 27:24.959
because I need to clear up your mess!

27:25.011 --> 27:27.127
- My mess?
- Uriel's still out there.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.712
And the clock is up...

27:28.798 --> 27:31.298
which means the detective
is in grave danger.

28:48.967 --> 28:50.383

now it's the children.

What are you doing here?

29:30.809 --> 29:32.592
I could ask you two the same thing.

29:32.678 --> 29:34.427
Uh, we're just having
a business meeting.

29:34.513 --> 29:35.595
- Yeah.
- Mm.

29:35.681 --> 29:37.097
You make out with all your clients?

29:37.182 --> 29:38.732
What's the occasion? You celebrating

29:38.817 --> 29:41.851
the successful theft of Wesley
and Kimo's merchandising money?

29:41.937 --> 29:44.404
I would never steal from my clients.

29:44.489 --> 29:46.940
Oh, you are clever, Ryan.

29:47.025 --> 29:49.025
- What is she talking about, Ryan?
- What I'm talking about

29:49.111 --> 29:50.410
is how Wesley realized

29:50.495 --> 29:52.862
his action figures were
selling like hotcakes,

29:52.914 --> 29:54.531
did some investigating,

29:54.583 --> 29:56.333
and saw that he was getting robbed.

29:56.368 --> 29:58.084
- I think you should go.
- Unfortunately for Wesley,

29:58.170 --> 30:00.453
he shared his concerns
about his business manager

30:00.539 --> 30:03.373
with his ex-wife, who happened
to be sleeping with him.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.375
And that voice mail
that you played for us,

30:05.460 --> 30:07.677
that's what started this, and
that's what got him killed.

30:10.215 --> 30:11.348
He did it!

30:11.383 --> 30:12.432
He's the one

30:12.517 --> 30:13.883
- who killed Wesley!
- What?!

30:13.969 --> 30:15.218
No, it was her idea!

30:15.270 --> 30:17.103
It was her idea to switch
out the Nunchuck Award,

30:17.189 --> 30:18.104
cover it in blood...

30:18.190 --> 30:18.938
Don't shoot!

30:19.024 --> 30:20.807
KIMO: You stole from me,

30:20.892 --> 30:21.941
killed Wesley,

30:22.027 --> 30:24.694
then you tried to frame me for it?!

30:24.730 --> 30:27.447
- Kimo...
- I cared about both of you!

30:28.483 --> 30:29.366
(screams) No, please!

30:29.401 --> 30:30.533
Kimo...

30:30.569 --> 30:32.202
put the gun down. Please.

30:32.237 --> 30:34.120
They murdered Wesley.

30:34.206 --> 30:36.956
And they will pay for
that, I promise you.

30:37.042 --> 30:40.160
But don't let them ruin your
life, too, Kimo. Please.

30:40.245 --> 30:41.411
My life is already ruined.

30:41.496 --> 30:42.662
Get out of the way.

30:42.748 --> 30:43.713
No. I'll shoot you!

30:43.749 --> 30:44.964
I don't care anymore!

30:45.050 --> 30:46.216
LUCIFER: Kimo!

30:46.251 --> 30:48.418
CHLOE: Lucifer, stay back.

30:48.503 --> 30:49.669
Guys, stand down.

30:49.755 --> 30:51.671
Detective, you don't know
what you're up against.

30:51.757 --> 30:53.923
This was engineered to
put you in harm's way.

30:54.009 --> 30:55.842
You must believe me.

30:55.927 --> 30:56.926
Lucifer,

30:57.012 --> 30:59.979
I know exactly what I'm up against.

31:00.065 --> 31:01.765
It's just a man...

31:01.850 --> 31:03.817
who's in a lot of pain.

31:07.906 --> 31:10.774
Kimo, a couple days ago

31:10.859 --> 31:13.777
I was in a really bad car accident.

31:13.829 --> 31:16.196
And I've spent the last few days

31:16.281 --> 31:18.581
trying to convince everybody
that cares about me

31:18.617 --> 31:20.500
that it wasn't a big deal.

31:20.585 --> 31:22.585
The truth is...

31:22.621 --> 31:25.004
I'm terrified.

31:25.090 --> 31:28.291
I'm scared of how it can all just end...

31:28.343 --> 31:29.793
with no rhyme or reason.

31:29.878 --> 31:32.095
And what I want to do right now

31:32.130 --> 31:34.130
is just go home

31:34.216 --> 31:36.349
and read a bedtime story to my daughter.

31:36.435 --> 31:40.470
But... you know... that's
not up to me, either.

31:40.555 --> 31:43.807
We can't control what happens to us,

31:43.892 --> 31:47.310
only how it affects us
and the choices we make.

31:48.313 --> 31:50.447
So, please.

31:50.482 --> 31:53.783
Make the right choice, Kimo.

31:53.819 --> 31:55.819
Please put down the gun.

32:04.463 --> 32:06.463
(sirens wailing)

32:07.749 --> 32:08.748
(exhales)

32:08.834 --> 32:11.417
(whispering): Thank you.

32:14.055 --> 32:16.089
Well, well done, Detective.

32:16.174 --> 32:17.841
Kimo was about to do a very bad thing.

32:17.926 --> 32:19.976
Oh, well, not on my watch.

32:20.011 --> 32:23.096
(chuckles) Very good.

32:23.181 --> 32:25.014
Let me escort you back to the station.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.934
No... I'm-I'm okay.

32:28.019 --> 32:30.904
You know, I don't believe in fate.

32:30.989 --> 32:33.490
And I don't believe in bad luck.

32:33.525 --> 32:37.660
And I appreciate your
concern, but come what may.

32:37.696 --> 32:40.663
I am leaving here... alone.

32:40.699 --> 32:43.249
Very well.

32:43.335 --> 32:46.703
But just... buckle up,
Detective, please.

32:46.755 --> 32:48.171
(sighs)

32:48.206 --> 32:49.873
Right. Now, if you'll excuse me.

32:49.958 --> 32:53.259

33:13.899 --> 33:16.399
I'm letting Uriel take me back to Hell.

33:16.484 --> 33:17.700
(scoffs)

33:17.736 --> 33:20.236
Well, there's no need
to overreact, Mother.

33:20.322 --> 33:22.121
MAZE: Let her go.

33:22.207 --> 33:24.407
It's the right move.

33:24.459 --> 33:26.075
Right. Of course.

33:26.127 --> 33:27.410
Remind me at some point
to give you a refresher

33:27.495 --> 33:28.745
on the meaning of loyalty.

33:28.830 --> 33:31.381
MAZE: It's what's best for everyone.

33:31.416 --> 33:34.751
She goes back to Hell,
where she belongs;

33:34.803 --> 33:36.386
Chloe is safe,

33:36.421 --> 33:39.589
and I don't have to clean
up your mess anymore.

33:39.674 --> 33:43.760
More importantly, you
get to keep your word.

33:43.845 --> 33:45.144
I am keeping my word.

33:45.230 --> 33:47.764
You're serving out your
sentence here on Earth.

33:47.849 --> 33:49.265
You know that's not what
your Father wanted.

33:49.351 --> 33:50.600
Do I?!

33:50.685 --> 33:53.736
Everyone thinks they know what He wants.

33:53.772 --> 33:57.273
Amenadiel did when he first
got here, now Uriel does.

33:57.359 --> 34:00.076
Human wars have been
waged because of it.

34:00.111 --> 34:02.195
Dad showed me

34:02.280 --> 34:04.197
an open door.

34:04.282 --> 34:06.249
Does that mean I was meant
to take you back to Hell

34:06.284 --> 34:08.835
or was he insinuating that
Hell was getting drafty?

34:08.920 --> 34:10.203
Nobody bloody knows,

34:10.288 --> 34:13.206
because the selfish bastard
won't just tell us!

34:13.291 --> 34:16.292
And I'm sick of it.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.877
No more.

34:18.964 --> 34:20.880
No more.

34:20.966 --> 34:24.350
There's my Lightbringer.

34:24.436 --> 34:26.436
My Morningstar.

34:29.224 --> 34:32.442
Uriel was so small when he was a child.

34:32.476 --> 34:35.777
All he ever wanted was to play
with you and the older kids.

34:35.813 --> 34:37.447
But you all excluded him.

34:37.482 --> 34:38.648
Yes.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.699
And every time he came back,

34:40.784 --> 34:42.652
pestering us again.

34:42.737 --> 34:44.621
Which is strange,

34:44.656 --> 34:46.706
considering he knew what
the outcome would be.

34:46.791 --> 34:50.493
That's how much he wanted
to be around you, Lucifer.

34:50.578 --> 34:53.329
Uriel is a stubborn boy.

34:53.380 --> 34:55.047
When he sets his mind,

34:55.132 --> 34:57.750
it doesn't waver.

34:57.836 --> 35:00.136
He's not going to give up until he has

35:00.171 --> 35:02.138
either me or that detective.

35:02.173 --> 35:03.923
Mum...

35:04.009 --> 35:06.509
I refuse to believe that.

35:06.561 --> 35:09.145
There is always another way.

35:09.180 --> 35:13.399

35:47.852 --> 35:51.554
the pattern faltered.

35:51.606 --> 35:54.107
I thought it meant you'd
actually bring Mom.

35:54.192 --> 35:56.893
That somehow, you'd surprise me.
'Cause for once in my life,

35:56.978 --> 35:58.945
I'd like to be surprised, but no.

35:59.030 --> 36:01.731
No, here you are.

36:06.071 --> 36:09.072
Are you done hiding behind
our big brother's skirt?

36:09.157 --> 36:10.623
(short chuckle)

36:10.709 --> 36:12.375
Yes, it's just me now.

36:13.175 --> 36:15.476
Big, bad Lucifer.

36:20.489 --> 36:22.589
We've already had this
fight before, Lucifer.

36:24.211 --> 36:25.992
Right here.

36:26.032 --> 36:27.383
You see, in my head,

36:27.532 --> 36:29.509
I've seen everything you do.

36:29.544 --> 36:31.878
I've heard every dumb
quip you have to say.

36:31.963 --> 36:33.179
Right, let me guess...

36:33.214 --> 36:34.881
in your version, I deliver Mom to you,

36:34.966 --> 36:38.217
apologizing, tears
streaming down my face.

36:38.303 --> 36:39.886
Actually, no. In my version,

36:39.938 --> 36:41.604
you refuse to give Mom up

36:41.689 --> 36:44.023
and your human friend dies.

36:44.058 --> 36:45.525
Yes, you've tried that twice now.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.809
Not much luck.

36:46.895 --> 36:49.061
Maybe you're not as good
at this as you thought.

36:49.113 --> 36:51.147
Maybe I'm building up to a big finale.

36:52.817 --> 36:54.734
All right.

36:54.786 --> 36:56.819
Uriel...

36:56.905 --> 36:59.405
you don't know what Dad wants.

36:59.491 --> 37:01.290
None of us do.

37:01.376 --> 37:03.576
- So I think...
- You're right.

37:03.628 --> 37:06.412
I don't know what Dad wants.
None of us do.

37:06.498 --> 37:08.714
Right.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.883
Great, well, I'm glad we had this talk.

37:10.919 --> 37:13.085
I'll see you at the next family reunion.

37:13.171 --> 37:14.420
I'll buy the first round.

37:14.506 --> 37:16.506
But I do know what he needs.

37:18.259 --> 37:20.092
Mom's out. It's only a matter of time

37:20.178 --> 37:21.844
before she finds her way back to Heaven,

37:21.930 --> 37:23.596
and then he'll forgive her.

37:23.681 --> 37:26.098
- He would never do that.
- Why not? You did.

37:26.184 --> 37:28.267
She's been here, like, what...
three minutes?

37:28.353 --> 37:29.685
Now you're already defending her.

37:29.771 --> 37:31.687
Dad'll do the same thing.

37:31.773 --> 37:33.523
He'll let His guard down.

37:33.608 --> 37:35.608
And then she'll destroy Him.

37:38.363 --> 37:40.780
I need to make sure that doesn't happen.

37:42.116 --> 37:44.200
That's Azrael's Blade.

37:44.285 --> 37:45.785
How do you have it?

37:45.837 --> 37:47.453
I borrowed it off the Angel of Death

37:47.505 --> 37:48.838
when she wasn't looking.

37:48.923 --> 37:51.290
You're not planning on
taking Mom back to Hell.

37:51.376 --> 37:54.293
That weapon will wipe her
out of existence entirely.

37:54.379 --> 37:56.212
No Heaven, no Hell, just...

37:57.849 --> 37:58.965
just gone.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.800
Finally, a moment of clarity between us.

38:00.885 --> 38:03.553
You've gone completely insane, brother.

38:03.638 --> 38:05.471
I'm doing what has to be done,

38:05.523 --> 38:07.106
and you've run out of time.

38:07.141 --> 38:09.642
See, I don't care about
your deal with Dad.

38:09.727 --> 38:12.028
I don't care about what
happens to your little human.

38:12.113 --> 38:13.813
But it's obvious you care for her

38:13.865 --> 38:16.315
a tad more than you do Mom.

38:16.401 --> 38:19.318
Now, all I need to do

38:19.404 --> 38:22.371
is hit this one little key right here.

38:22.457 --> 38:25.458
A sequence will begin,
and two days from now...

38:25.493 --> 38:28.160
your cute little human will finally die.

38:28.212 --> 38:31.881
So, Lucifer,

38:31.966 --> 38:34.333
you can either let that happen

38:34.419 --> 38:36.218
or you can give me Mom.

38:36.304 --> 38:38.304
Last chance.

38:39.891 --> 38:41.891
You choose.

38:44.012 --> 38:45.261
Very well.

38:48.399 --> 38:51.567
Well, you didn't see
that coming, did you?

38:51.653 --> 38:52.985
Eh?

38:55.156 --> 38:57.823
Actually, I did see it coming.

38:57.859 --> 39:00.242
(grunting)

39:03.114 --> 39:06.198
I mean, I knew you were gonna attack.

39:06.284 --> 39:08.034
I just wasn't sure how.

39:15.426 --> 39:16.876
Patterns are tricky like that.

39:16.928 --> 39:19.095
Takes time to get a real sense of them.

39:21.549 --> 39:23.215
I needed to study you a bit.

39:25.853 --> 39:28.020
Took much less time than I expected.

39:28.056 --> 39:30.723
Aah!

39:49.827 --> 39:51.494
You're lucky I'd never

39:51.579 --> 39:53.913
use Azrael's Blade on you, brother.

39:58.469 --> 40:00.753
Why don't you pick on a girl?

40:00.838 --> 40:02.054
But I have no qualms

40:02.090 --> 40:05.257
about using it on a filthy,
scum-sucking demon.

40:22.777 --> 40:24.860
You haven't disappointed, Mazikeen.

40:24.946 --> 40:26.946
Your patterns were tough to see.

40:30.952 --> 40:31.951
Aah!

40:34.672 --> 40:37.673
But still predictable nonetheless.

40:49.687 --> 40:51.971
Because you made it so difficult,

40:52.056 --> 40:55.558
now I'm gonna take out
Mom and the detective.

40:56.944 --> 40:58.444
You can't stop me, brother.

41:05.036 --> 41:06.869
I didn't see that coming.

41:11.459 --> 41:13.459
(whispers)

41:20.084 --> 41:22.334
What did he say?

41:24.088 --> 41:26.806
I... I couldn't understand.

41:26.841 --> 41:29.341
Prick got what he deserved.
