00:17.586 --> 00:19.587
I want to, uh--

00:30.132 --> 00:33.168
taupe.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.539
- Is that--?
- Justice Thomas.

00:37.541 --> 00:38.540
I knew it.

00:38.542 --> 00:39.574
What can I do for you,
Louis?

00:39.576 --> 00:41.743
Ah, to the point.
Of course.

00:41.745 --> 00:43.478
I wanted t--

00:43.480 --> 00:46.581
I wanted to congratulate you
on bringing in Pfister Insurance

00:46.583 --> 00:47.916
and let you know
I've taken the liberty

00:47.918 --> 00:49.417
of putting together
the initial paperwork.

00:49.419 --> 00:51.820
Excellent.
Leave it there.

00:51.822 --> 00:53.188
I wanted
to follow it through.

00:53.190 --> 00:54.622
I would relish
the opportunity to--

00:54.624 --> 00:57.091
Nonsense.
Louis, it's beneath you.

00:57.093 --> 00:59.594
Oh, I think you'll find
nothing's beneath me.

00:59.596 --> 01:02.197
Are you offering
something untoward to me?

01:02.199 --> 01:05.132
I'm simply saying that
I'm not oblivious to the fact

01:05.135 --> 01:07.702
that there's change afoot,
firm dynamic-wise.

01:07.704 --> 01:09.771
We used to be--huh.

01:09.773 --> 01:12.774
Now, we're kinda--hmm.

01:12.776 --> 01:15.376
We might need
a little--hmm.

01:15.378 --> 01:16.845
[Laughing] You know?
Louis.

01:16.847 --> 01:20.915
I'd like things to operate with
a certain integrity around here.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.584
Oh, I admire
that philosophy.

01:22.586 --> 01:24.419
I actually try
to live by it myself.

01:24.421 --> 01:25.887
Good.

01:25.889 --> 01:30.024
Now,
can you do me a favor?

01:30.026 --> 01:31.359
Anything.

01:31.361 --> 01:33.228
Send Mike Ross to me.

01:33.230 --> 01:35.930
Ross?
You want to work with Ross?

01:35.932 --> 01:37.465
He's actually
working for me right now

01:37.467 --> 01:40.235
on the Liquid Water
litigation,

01:40.237 --> 01:42.303
and he's been on it for weeks,
and I wish I could do it,

01:42.305 --> 01:44.305
but I cannot.
I can't do it right now.

01:44.307 --> 01:45.773
Then forget
I said anything.

01:45.775 --> 01:48.276
But I can give you
Dickinson.

01:50.913 --> 01:52.981
Okay.

01:52.983 --> 01:55.416
Let me know
how that works out.

01:55.418 --> 01:57.619
With Ross.

01:57.621 --> 01:59.621
Okay.

02:01.056 --> 02:03.691
Um, I am taking Mike exclusively
for the next two weeks.

02:03.693 --> 02:04.792
Excuse me?

02:04.794 --> 02:06.661
I'm calling in
my chip.

02:06.663 --> 02:08.863
Our wager? The Price sisters?
My triumph?

02:08.865 --> 02:10.832
Does that ring a bell?
Can't have him.

02:10.834 --> 02:11.900
Oh, well,
then I guess you'd rather

02:11.902 --> 02:13.167
that I announce
to the entire office

02:13.169 --> 02:16.004
that the mighty Harvey Specter
is a welcher.

02:16.006 --> 02:20.375
I didn't welch.
You passed on him.

02:20.377 --> 02:22.677
Okay, please.
I'm begging you. I need him.

02:22.679 --> 02:24.145
Okay,
tell you what, Louis.

02:24.147 --> 02:27.749
Just say out loud that I am
the best closer in New York,

02:27.751 --> 02:29.317
and you can have him.
Fine.

02:29.319 --> 02:30.418
To Donna.

02:30.420 --> 02:33.855
- No.
- Then we don't have a deal.

02:33.857 --> 02:35.156
Welcher.

02:35.158 --> 02:37.525
That was fun.
Morning.

02:37.527 --> 02:40.361
If that's a big check,
I want another Marni bag.

02:40.363 --> 02:42.130
Hands off the vinyl,
junior.

02:42.132 --> 02:44.032
10:00, nice of you
to join us.

02:44.034 --> 02:45.600
I was closing Cranston
this morning.

02:45.602 --> 02:47.802
Oh, yeah? Couldn't get it done
by 9:00, huh?

02:47.804 --> 02:50.538
You're a little lippy
for a Monday.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.374
- What the hell?
- What? What is it?

02:53.376 --> 02:55.209
"Draft of complaint
from Smith and Devane,

02:55.211 --> 02:57.145
threatening to reopen
Randall v. CM,"

02:57.147 --> 02:58.680
a case I won
4 years ago.

02:58.682 --> 03:00.014
Randall v. CM?

03:00.016 --> 03:02.150
Ah, accident
on the Merritt Parkway.

03:02.152 --> 03:03.985
They claimed it was
Coastal Motors' hood,

03:03.987 --> 03:07.455
you killed it in court
by saying it was the driver.

03:07.457 --> 03:09.390
This can't be surprising
to you anymore.

03:09.392 --> 03:10.491
They're saying
there's new evidence.

03:10.493 --> 03:12.527
New evidence?
It's product liability.

03:12.529 --> 03:14.595
The statute of limitations
is expired.

03:14.597 --> 03:16.030
Which means
it's a shakedown.

03:16.032 --> 03:17.498
You gotta quash
that shit.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.701
I do, and I will.

03:19.703 --> 03:21.469
Whoa.
[Laughs]

03:21.471 --> 03:24.205
Come on.
The Spinners? Really?

03:24.207 --> 03:26.040
For your information,
the Spinners were

03:26.042 --> 03:28.710
one of the defining pop bands
of their time.

03:28.712 --> 03:30.278
Oh.
Oh, wow, sorry.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.847
Yeah, that's cool, like, uh,
like, the Jonas Brothers

03:32.849 --> 03:37.986
or Hanson or 'NSYNC
or Selena Gomez, yeah.

03:39.822 --> 03:41.289
Come here, lippy.
I want to show you something.

03:41.291 --> 03:44.759
Yeah?
What, you got Bieber fever?

03:53.569 --> 03:56.871
Prepare motions to dismiss
by end of day Thursday,

03:56.873 --> 03:58.473
and don't puss out
when Judge Edelstein

03:58.475 --> 04:00.241
tries to stifle
my brilliance.

04:00.243 --> 04:01.542
[Knocking at the door]

04:01.544 --> 04:04.612
- He's all yours.
- What?

04:04.614 --> 04:05.713
Why the sudden
change of mind?

04:05.715 --> 04:07.081
Does it matter?

04:07.083 --> 04:08.082
You're punishing him,
aren't you?

04:08.084 --> 04:09.550
- Yes.
- So you're saying

04:09.552 --> 04:11.119
working for me is punishment?
As far as I'm concerned,

04:11.121 --> 04:12.553
this whole conversation's
punishment.

04:12.555 --> 04:13.554
Oh, here we go.

04:13.556 --> 04:14.922
- Duration?
- One case.

04:14.924 --> 04:16.423
- Jurisdiction?
- Exclusive.

04:16.426 --> 04:18.493
- What can I do to him?
- What do you want to do to him?

04:18.495 --> 04:21.129
Harvey.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.497
Things.

04:22.499 --> 04:23.731
That is not
a legitimate answer.

04:23.733 --> 04:25.199
Honor the boundaries
of labor law?

04:25.201 --> 04:26.567
I prefer
the Geneva Convention.

04:26.569 --> 04:29.637
- Then we have a deal.
- We--[sighs]

04:31.040 --> 04:34.175
I think
I need a sick day.

04:41.950 --> 04:43.251
Careful there,
Harv.

04:43.253 --> 04:45.119
That's high-end
Brazilian cherry

04:45.121 --> 04:47.021
from the South American
rainforest.

04:47.023 --> 04:49.057
Tanner.
You selling furniture now?

04:49.059 --> 04:52.593
No, but if we both did,
I'd sell more than you.

04:52.595 --> 04:54.429
I thought I told you
to stay out of my city.

04:54.431 --> 04:57.298
Can't. I'm the newest senior
partner at Smith and Devane.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.566
Don't get
too comfortable.

04:58.568 --> 05:00.735
If all you're bringing
is the Boston shakedown,

05:00.737 --> 05:01.969
you're not gonna
be here long.

05:01.971 --> 05:03.404
Oh, I'm bringing
more than that, Harvey.

05:03.406 --> 05:05.206
Randall versus CM
is a winner.

05:05.208 --> 05:06.474
That case
was litigated.

05:06.476 --> 05:07.708
- Not by me.
- Well, let me

05:07.710 --> 05:09.043
bring you up to speed.

05:09.045 --> 05:11.612
Frank Randall had a history
of substance abuse.

05:11.614 --> 05:14.148
His family tried to blame
Coastal Motors,

05:14.150 --> 05:16.784
but his death had nothing to do
with the carmaker or its design.

05:16.786 --> 05:18.453
Yeah, well,
we've got new evidence

05:18.455 --> 05:20.021
that contradicts
that assertion.

05:20.023 --> 05:22.156
Oh, look at that,
you learned some new words.

05:22.158 --> 05:25.426
Even if it were true, the
statute of limitations ran out.

05:25.428 --> 05:27.195
Well, what you call
a shakedown,

05:27.197 --> 05:29.831
I call a sure thing.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.365
This is
an internal memo.

05:31.367 --> 05:34.001
Showing that CM
knew about engineering defects.

05:34.003 --> 05:36.904
You're on the wrong side
of this one, Harvey.

05:36.906 --> 05:38.439
I never saw this thing
in my life.

05:38.441 --> 05:41.309
Sure looks like you did,
and that statute of limitations

05:41.311 --> 05:43.311
doesn't apply
to fraudulent concealment.

05:43.313 --> 05:45.179
I didn't conceal
jack shit.

05:45.181 --> 05:46.714
Harvey,
that's for your client.

05:46.716 --> 05:49.117
We want $46 million
and not a penny less,

05:49.119 --> 05:51.853
and this,
well, that's for you

05:51.855 --> 05:54.188
because we're suing you
and your entire firm for fraud.

05:54.190 --> 05:57.658
[Chuckles] You really
want to come after me again?

05:57.660 --> 05:59.594
I'm not moving down here
for the Sushi.

05:59.596 --> 06:01.729
0 and 2 doesn't look good
on a resume.

06:01.731 --> 06:04.165
You know, I'm thinking
Upper East Side.

06:04.167 --> 06:05.399
Well,
why don't you check out

06:05.401 --> 06:08.669

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

06:45.548 --> 06:46.949
This looks bad,
Harvey.

06:46.951 --> 06:48.684
I don't care how it looks,
it's bullshit .

06:48.686 --> 06:50.652
Then tell me what's bullshit
because I'm looking at

06:50.654 --> 06:52.921
a document that undermines
your entire defense.

06:52.923 --> 06:54.990
An anonymous memo with names
and dates blacked out.

06:54.992 --> 06:57.859
It's damning, and it
implicates you in a cover-up.

06:57.861 --> 06:59.127
Never crossed my desk.

06:59.129 --> 07:04.099
I'm not saying it did.
I'm saying it looks bad.

07:04.101 --> 07:05.634
I don't want Daniel
knowing about this.

07:05.636 --> 07:08.003
I got nothing to hide.
I didn't do anything wrong.

07:08.005 --> 07:11.106
I believe you, but you're not
my only concern at the moment.

07:11.108 --> 07:13.242
You know full well
what Daniel will do

07:13.244 --> 07:15.077
if he finds out
you're being accused of fraud

07:15.079 --> 07:16.545
and it happened
on my watch.

07:16.547 --> 07:18.880
He'll use it against us,
but I also know

07:18.882 --> 07:20.649
that he's familiar
with the people at CM,

07:20.651 --> 07:22.484
and he's bound to find out
sooner or later.

07:22.486 --> 07:25.420
Then make it go away
before it gets to sooner.

07:32.629 --> 07:34.329
Durham Foods
v. Liquid Water.

07:34.331 --> 07:36.331
I need motions to dismiss,
compel,

07:36.333 --> 07:37.833
strike,
and change venue.

07:37.835 --> 07:39.034
Why are they not
finished yet?

07:39.036 --> 07:40.502
Okay, Louis,
I might be a quick study,

07:40.504 --> 07:43.272
but I'm gonna need a tad
more information than that.

07:43.274 --> 07:45.307
[Sighs]
Have you heard of Liquid Water?

07:45.309 --> 07:49.745
Yeah, sure. Liquid Water.
"We put the I.Q. in liquid."

07:49.747 --> 07:51.413
You see?
You already know the client.

07:51.415 --> 07:52.948
- What did they do?
- They didn't do anything.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.116
They're being accused

07:54.118 --> 07:55.217
of coming up with
a deceptive slogan.

07:55.219 --> 07:57.052
- By Durham Foods.
- Exactly.

07:57.054 --> 07:58.787
They have their own line
of bottled water, which,

07:58.789 --> 08:01.223
by the way,
tastes like a stagnant pond.

08:01.225 --> 08:02.791
So how do we
defend against their claim?

08:02.793 --> 08:04.793
Who said anything about "we,"
white man?

08:04.795 --> 08:06.428
My defense is puffery.

08:06.430 --> 08:07.929
Oh, you're gonna
stick out your chest?

08:07.931 --> 08:09.398
No, Mike,
"puffery" is--

08:09.400 --> 08:10.599
A big, bold,
empty statement

08:10.601 --> 08:12.167
not meant to be taken as fact,
therefore

08:12.169 --> 08:14.703
not subject to deceptive
advertising litigation.

08:14.705 --> 08:16.605
Touche.

08:16.607 --> 08:17.906
See?
It's a solid case.

08:17.908 --> 08:20.342
I agree.
No one would actually believe

08:20.344 --> 08:22.611
that drinking Liquid Water
would raise your I.Q.

08:22.613 --> 08:24.413
I mean, who would be
that stupid?

08:24.415 --> 08:26.815
I mean, other than people
who actually drink...

08:26.817 --> 08:28.850
Liquid Water.

08:30.987 --> 08:32.421
You know what?
Whatever.

08:32.423 --> 08:34.188
Just don't mention that
last part in the deposition,

08:34.191 --> 08:35.190
okay?
Yeah, okay.

08:35.192 --> 08:36.725
Wait, Louis?

08:36.727 --> 08:39.294
Um,
if we're claiming puffery,

08:39.296 --> 08:41.229
why do I need to waste
all my time with these motions?

08:41.231 --> 08:42.597
All right, let me
explain something to you.

08:42.599 --> 08:44.733
We're at war,
and in times of war,

08:44.735 --> 08:46.435
a private does not question
his commanding officer.

08:46.437 --> 08:48.603
If I ask you to wipe out
a village, you say, "how high?"

08:48.605 --> 08:49.938
- That--
- Which brings me

08:49.940 --> 08:51.973
to my next point.
You report to me and me only.

08:51.975 --> 08:53.809
You don't talk about
our business with anyone else.

08:53.811 --> 08:55.677
You're in by 7:00,
you're out no sooner than 10:00,

08:55.679 --> 08:58.280
and here's the most important
thing, no sex of any kind.

08:58.282 --> 09:00.015
Weakens legs,
clouds your judgment. Got it?

09:00.017 --> 09:01.316
- I'm not sure I do.
- Good.

09:01.318 --> 09:04.119
Okay.

09:04.121 --> 09:06.088
No sex.

09:06.090 --> 09:08.256
No sex.
Got it.

09:13.730 --> 09:15.597
Oh, my God.

09:15.599 --> 09:16.932
Well?

09:16.934 --> 09:18.734
- Oh, my God.
- Donna,

09:18.736 --> 09:20.569
I need to know
if you ever saw this.

09:20.571 --> 09:22.838
Yes, Harvey,
I saw the smoking gun

09:22.840 --> 09:24.639
in a multimillion-dollar
liability claim,

09:24.641 --> 09:26.675
and I hid it from you.

09:26.677 --> 09:29.010
I also know where Amelia
Earhart's living, and I have

09:29.012 --> 09:30.746
the missing 18 minutes
from the Watergate tapes.

09:30.748 --> 09:32.013
All right,
take it easy.

09:32.015 --> 09:33.849
I don't like
having my competence questioned.

09:33.851 --> 09:35.617
Yeah, and I don't like
being sued for fraud.

09:35.619 --> 09:37.285
That document
never came into this office,

09:37.287 --> 09:38.787
or you would have
seen it.

09:38.789 --> 09:40.822
Donna, two dozen people
worked on this case,

09:40.824 --> 09:42.958
and any one of them could have
seen it and missed it.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.126
I need to know
that didn't happen,

09:44.128 --> 09:46.094
or I need to know
who to fire.

09:46.096 --> 09:49.097
Give me an order.

09:49.099 --> 09:51.233
Go through every file
in the original case

09:51.235 --> 09:53.201
and make sure
that document isn't in them,

09:53.203 --> 09:54.770
and do it
without anyone knowing.

09:54.772 --> 09:57.539
Done.

10:00.276 --> 10:02.911
Okay, ha ha,
joke's on me.

10:02.913 --> 10:04.413
Aren't you
Louis's boy?

10:04.415 --> 10:06.248
Yes, I get it.
No more fondling the vinyl.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.950
Or besmirching
the good name of the Spinners.

10:08.952 --> 10:11.119
Yes, I totally deserve
to be handed over

10:11.121 --> 10:13.255
to the poor man's Lex Luthor
for that.

10:13.257 --> 10:15.657
Please, Harvey,
you have to get me back.

10:15.659 --> 10:16.992
- Have to?
- Will you?

10:16.994 --> 10:18.560
He thinks
we're going to war.

10:18.562 --> 10:21.496
He give you the
"burn down the village" speech?

10:21.498 --> 10:22.964
Yes.
What is it with him?

10:22.966 --> 10:24.633
It's like the pony thing
all over again.

10:24.635 --> 10:26.234
He's, like, the captain
of mixed metaphors.

10:26.236 --> 10:28.303
Look, I can't
take you back now.

10:28.305 --> 10:30.005
I have to honor my bet,

10:30.007 --> 10:32.274
especially since
my honor's in question.

10:32.276 --> 10:34.609
Okay, why are you strangely
emphasizing the word "honor?"

10:34.611 --> 10:36.244
This letter
of complaint.

10:36.246 --> 10:38.747
I'm being accused of fraud
by Travis Tanner.

10:38.749 --> 10:43.318
Isn't that like the pot
accusing the kettle of...fraud?

10:43.320 --> 10:45.821
I'm going to the airport
to talk to CM right now.

10:45.823 --> 10:47.222
I'm want to reassure
Lawrence Kemp

10:47.224 --> 10:48.490
that we're all over this.

10:48.492 --> 10:49.925
Please, Harvey, come on.
Take me with you.

10:49.927 --> 10:51.860
I can do this.
I can work for both of you.

10:51.862 --> 10:53.995
It's too risky.
I'm solo on this.

10:53.997 --> 10:55.430
- [Sighs]
- Besides, I've got

10:55.432 --> 10:57.833
a relationship with Kemp.
I should talk to him alone.

10:57.835 --> 10:59.301
Not a word to Louis.
Understand?

10:59.303 --> 11:01.636
Yeah. Hey, he said
that I can't have sex

11:01.638 --> 11:04.606
while I'm working with him.
Is that really his call?

11:04.608 --> 11:06.708
Well, he is
your commanding officer.

11:31.501 --> 11:34.302
You looking for <i>Civil Torts,</i>
<i>Volume Three?</i>

11:34.304 --> 11:36.171
People put that in criminal law.
I hate that.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.506
Yeah, I know.
Me too.

11:37.508 --> 11:39.808
Oh, I knew we had something
in common.

11:39.810 --> 11:41.243
You need my help?

11:41.245 --> 11:43.845
Ah no, I've actually
got it right...there.

11:43.847 --> 11:46.414
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

11:46.416 --> 11:49.317
Harold, you're the associate,
and I'm the paralegal.

11:49.319 --> 11:51.920
It's my job to help you,
not the other way around.

11:51.922 --> 11:53.788
I don't see us
that way.

11:53.790 --> 11:57.158
Okay, um, you want to help me?
My--my stapler is broken.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.226
Could you get me
a new one?

11:58.228 --> 11:59.594
I'll get you three.

11:59.596 --> 12:01.196
Harold.

12:06.736 --> 12:10.939
[Whispers]
Thank you.

12:14.110 --> 12:15.110
Good to see you,
Lawrence.

12:15.112 --> 12:16.177
Harvey,
good to see you.

12:16.179 --> 12:17.345
Sorry this had to be
on the fly.

12:17.347 --> 12:18.980
It's not a problem.

12:18.982 --> 12:20.515
I want to start
by giving you my word

12:20.517 --> 12:23.218
that we crushed this suit once,
we're gonna to crush it again.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.553
I should hope so.

12:24.555 --> 12:26.588
I was hoping to have
this discussion privately.

12:26.590 --> 12:29.257
Well, this is our new
general counsel, Matt Lasker.

12:29.259 --> 12:31.092
He insisted on being
part of the discussion.

12:31.094 --> 12:32.761
Forgive me,
I'm just getting up to speed.

12:32.763 --> 12:34.229
- Then you should know that--
- Out of curiosity,

12:34.231 --> 12:35.964
why did you receive
a draft of the complaint

12:35.966 --> 12:38.833
before we did,
Mr. Specter?

12:38.835 --> 12:41.236
Travis Tanner gave me
an advanced copy.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.404
Must like you.

12:42.406 --> 12:44.105
We have
a special relationship.

12:44.107 --> 12:45.907
- Which I've looked into.
- Harvey,

12:45.909 --> 12:47.976
he really seems to have
a bone to pick with you.

12:47.978 --> 12:48.977
That's not gonna be
a problem.

12:48.979 --> 12:51.680
May be for us.

12:53.849 --> 12:56.318
Tanner came to see you,
didn't he?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.486
- At our request.
- Lawrence, I'm telling you,

12:58.488 --> 12:59.521
we can handle this.

12:59.523 --> 13:01.590
We just need
to stick together.

13:01.592 --> 13:04.759
Look, if I'm going to defend us
against this suit--

13:04.761 --> 13:08.229
"If" being
the operative word.

13:08.231 --> 13:10.599
[Laughs]
A-am I being fired?

13:10.601 --> 13:12.567
Ww--we're keeping you
on retainer

13:12.569 --> 13:14.269
while we evaluate
our options.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.338
Don't you see, Tanner's trying
to put a wedge between us?

13:16.340 --> 13:18.707
What Lawrence is reluctant
to tell you is,

13:18.709 --> 13:20.308
your relationship
with this man

13:20.310 --> 13:22.210
has put us
directly in his crosshairs.

13:22.212 --> 13:24.479
There is
a wedge between us.

13:24.481 --> 13:26.815
Maybe Lawrence's reluctance
stems from the fact

13:26.817 --> 13:28.883
that I also have
a relationship with him.

13:28.885 --> 13:31.686
Harvey, I have
a corporate responsibility here.

13:31.688 --> 13:33.822
Well, while you're evaluating
your options,

13:33.824 --> 13:36.091
why don't you think about
who was there for your company

13:36.093 --> 13:39.294
four years ago and what happened
to your stock price after I won.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.862
Oh, you got paid
very well for that.

13:40.864 --> 13:41.896
As were you.

13:41.898 --> 13:43.999
You had a huge bonus
that year,

13:44.001 --> 13:46.234
and I don't actually
recall it ever going back down.

13:46.236 --> 13:47.502
There's no need
to get personal.

13:47.504 --> 13:49.204
You...our asses
are on the line,

13:49.206 --> 13:51.139
and you're trying
to cut me loose--it's personal.

13:51.141 --> 13:52.974
- Harvey--
- Save the "it's not you,

13:52.976 --> 13:56.745
it's me" speech, okay?
Be a man and make a clean break.

13:56.747 --> 13:58.079
- Fine.
- No.

13:58.081 --> 13:59.414
- You're fired.
- [Sighs]

13:59.416 --> 14:02.150
He's on record.

14:08.491 --> 14:10.258
Remember I told you
it was

14:10.260 --> 14:12.160
to work with me and Louis
at the same time?

14:12.162 --> 14:13.595
Yes.

14:13.597 --> 14:15.130
We have to take
that risk.

14:15.132 --> 14:17.532
I need you to go through
every file in this case.

14:17.534 --> 14:19.367
You mean you want me to find
what you missed?

14:19.369 --> 14:20.969
I didn't miss
anything.

14:20.971 --> 14:22.804
I need you to go through
those files

14:22.806 --> 14:26.875
and tell me what's not in there.
Shit, I gotta go.

14:28.678 --> 14:29.878
What happened?

14:29.880 --> 14:32.280
Well, I got good news
and bad news.

14:32.282 --> 14:34.716
- What's the bad news?
- I got us fired.

14:34.718 --> 14:35.750
What's the good news?

14:35.752 --> 14:37.919
Anything we find
from here on out

14:37.921 --> 14:40.355
is no longer covered
by attorney client privilege.

14:49.897 --> 14:51.431
Did you find
what you're not looking for?

14:51.433 --> 14:53.333
No, did you find
what you're not looking for?

14:53.335 --> 14:56.036
Nope. Oh, my God,
it is so stuffy in here.

14:56.038 --> 14:58.438
What are the symptoms
of carbon dioxide poisoning?

14:58.440 --> 15:01.575
Uh, headaches, dizziness,
mental confusion,

15:01.577 --> 15:03.410
mental confusion.

15:03.412 --> 15:05.912
[Knocking at the door]

15:05.914 --> 15:07.280
Kevin,
trusts and estates?

15:07.282 --> 15:09.516
No, it's too meek.
It's gotta be a woman.

15:09.518 --> 15:10.784
Who is it?

15:10.786 --> 15:13.453
- Harold. I need a stapler.
- I was right.

15:13.455 --> 15:14.654
Okay, there are files
everywhere.

15:14.656 --> 15:15.722
He's gonna be suspicious.
What do we do?

15:15.724 --> 15:16.990
Don't worry, I got it.

15:16.992 --> 15:17.991
I got th--
what are you-?

15:17.993 --> 15:19.025
Come here.

15:19.027 --> 15:20.127
Ow!
Oh, come on, you pussy.

15:20.129 --> 15:21.328
- Ow. Okay, what are you--?
- Shh.

15:21.330 --> 15:23.130
What's going on?

15:23.132 --> 15:25.132
Come in.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.403
Hi, Harold, honey.

15:30.405 --> 15:31.972
Is this why it says,
"Do not enter?"

15:31.974 --> 15:34.107
We're kind of busy in here.
Do you mind if, um...

15:34.109 --> 15:35.308
- [Clears throat]
- You know,

15:35.310 --> 15:36.543
you just don't bother us
anymore?

15:36.545 --> 15:38.512
Sure.
No problem.

15:42.350 --> 15:43.950
Yeah, he didn't notice
the files.

15:43.952 --> 15:47.554
Oh, sh--, I'm late for
Louis's settlement conference.

15:47.556 --> 15:51.458
Uh, and...thanks.

15:53.027 --> 15:54.427
You're welcome.

15:54.429 --> 15:56.196
And then I take the shuttle
to Grand Central,

15:56.198 --> 15:57.564
and then I take the local
from there.

15:57.566 --> 16:00.233
I think you'll find that...
pleasurable, actually.

16:00.235 --> 16:01.635
Sorry, restroom.

16:01.637 --> 16:04.004
No, that's okay.
This is my associate, Mike Ross.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.374
He was busy, uh, drafting
some pertinent documents.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.379
Motion to dismiss,
motion to compel,

16:12.381 --> 16:15.482
motion to strike,
motion to change venue,

16:15.484 --> 16:17.350
and we have another half dozen
in the pipeline.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.119
- No, they're here.
- Oh.

16:19.121 --> 16:20.320
What is this?

16:20.322 --> 16:22.022
This was supposed to be
a settlement conference.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.324
Oh, we're not here to settle.
We're proceeding to trial.

16:24.326 --> 16:26.226
You want to take this case
to trial?

16:26.228 --> 16:30.030
Um, unless I can't hear
the sound of my own voice,

16:30.032 --> 16:31.698
I believe that's
what I just frickin' said.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.733
We're the little guy.

16:33.735 --> 16:36.570
Your parent company's
a behemoth.

16:36.572 --> 16:37.938
A jury's gonna hate you.

16:37.940 --> 16:39.472
Well, thanks to your
disgusting smears in the media,

16:39.474 --> 16:40.941
that might be true,

16:40.943 --> 16:43.510
which is why we're also filing
a countersuit for libel,

16:43.512 --> 16:45.912
slander, and anything else
that might be appropriate

16:45.914 --> 16:49.182
in this case.
Tortious interference?

16:49.184 --> 16:51.384
This is--you got--this is not
good faith, Mr. Litt.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.720
Sir, you have besmirched
the good name of Liquid Water,

16:53.722 --> 16:56.189
and if you think that we're here
for a settlement conference,

16:56.191 --> 16:58.024
well, let me just correct
that one for you right now.

16:58.026 --> 17:00.794
We are not settling.
We will not be settling.

17:00.796 --> 17:03.096
In fact, the only thing
that's settling here

17:03.098 --> 17:06.599
is the sediment at the bottom
of your putrid water. Get me?

17:06.602 --> 17:08.300
Now be sure to take
that Grand Central shuttle

17:08.303 --> 17:11.238
like I told you, okay?
I think you're gonna love it.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.640
- Uh, that was--
- Amazing? I know.

17:13.642 --> 17:16.576
- I'm sorry, Louis, that I, uh--
- Questioned my orders? I know.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.244
[Sighs] I thought it was
just busy work.

17:18.247 --> 17:20.480
Well, it wasn't. For every
hour you spent drafting them,

17:20.482 --> 17:21.781
they're gonna spend
ten hours

17:21.782 --> 17:23.817
figuring out
how to argue it back in court.

17:23.819 --> 17:25.551
You're gonna bury them
in paperwork.

17:25.554 --> 17:27.087
Look at you.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.389
You catch on quick.
What happens next?

17:29.391 --> 17:31.658
They squirm for a day or two,
reevaluate,

17:31.660 --> 17:33.260
and come back to us
on our terms.

17:33.262 --> 17:35.862
Like...tomorrow,
maybe?

17:35.864 --> 17:37.797
- Tomo--[Laughs]
- [Chuckles]

17:37.799 --> 17:40.967
Mike. Sweet,
impressionable, young Mike.

17:40.969 --> 17:42.168
You see,
unlike what Harvey believes,

17:42.170 --> 17:43.837
going to trial
is a good thing,

17:43.839 --> 17:45.739
especially when the other side
can't afford it.

17:45.741 --> 17:47.974
Durham Foods,
their financials are soft,

17:47.976 --> 17:49.342
but it's gonna take a trial
to put 'em down,

17:49.344 --> 17:50.543
so you better
lace up your bootstraps

17:50.545 --> 17:51.645
'cause this battle
could take months.

17:51.647 --> 17:54.214
[Sighs]

17:55.683 --> 17:57.817
Uh, where you going?

17:57.819 --> 17:59.719
Uh, I just
have to go back...

17:59.721 --> 18:01.421
to, uh, the bathroom.

18:01.423 --> 18:02.622
You just went.

18:02.624 --> 18:03.990
Are you keeping track?

18:03.992 --> 18:06.760
I may start.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.167
I don't mean to intrude,
but Donna's not at her desk.

18:14.169 --> 18:16.169
Do you have a minute?

18:17.538 --> 18:20.874
I overstepped last week.
I want to make up for it.

18:20.876 --> 18:22.275
It's not necessary,
Daniel.

18:22.277 --> 18:24.344
Pfister Insurance.
I thought

18:24.346 --> 18:27.814
maybe we could handle them
together.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.650
I'm gonna to have
to take a rain check.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.686
It's a peace offering, Harvey.
Take it.

18:32.688 --> 18:34.254
You know, I'm sorry,

18:34.256 --> 18:36.957
but my plate's just
a little full at the moment.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.591
Do you mind if I ask
with what?

18:38.593 --> 18:40.827
Uh, the usual.
I have six situations,

18:40.829 --> 18:42.295
all in need
of immediate attention.

18:42.297 --> 18:45.799
Which begs the question,
why not add one more?

18:48.536 --> 18:51.538
I'll see if I can free up
some time next week, okay?

18:57.111 --> 19:00.013
Um...I think
I didn't find something.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.182
Let me
not have it then.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.085
During the two years
before our car was manufactured,

19:05.087 --> 19:07.187
there was this mid-level
quality control manager

19:07.189 --> 19:09.356
named Sarah Layton,
who wrote several reports

19:09.358 --> 19:12.025
on other CM car models
but never on ours.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.960
So she's not relevant
to our case.

19:13.962 --> 19:17.364
It would appear that way,
but after May 5th, 2006,

19:17.366 --> 19:19.399
she never wrote
another report ever again.

19:19.401 --> 19:20.967
That's kind of a coincidence,
isn't it?

19:20.969 --> 19:23.603
That on the exact date that
our car went into production,

19:23.605 --> 19:25.438
she disappeared
from CM's records?

19:25.440 --> 19:26.673
She could've just
been fired.

19:26.675 --> 19:27.841
Never filed
for unemployment.

19:27.843 --> 19:31.177
- Could've quit.
- No exit interview.

19:31.179 --> 19:32.278
Permanent unpaid leave.

19:32.280 --> 19:33.713
Gets out of any records.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.215
And nothing to tie her
to our car.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.449
She wrote that memo.

19:36.451 --> 19:37.984
- Very smart.
- Thank you.

19:37.986 --> 19:39.285
I meant them,
not you.

19:39.287 --> 19:41.588
But I found it.
That makes me even smarter.

19:41.590 --> 19:43.556
Don't be cocky.
It's unbecoming.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.292
- [Clears throat]
- On you. I can pull it off.

19:46.294 --> 19:49.062
You better be nice to me
because I know where she lives.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.831
Where who lives?

19:51.833 --> 19:53.099
My high school sweetheart.
We connected on Facebook.

19:53.101 --> 19:55.535
Oh. Bullshit,
you're not that sentimental.

19:55.537 --> 19:57.771
- Yes, I am.
- She was his first.

19:58.806 --> 20:02.609
Deposition tomorrow.
Be ready.

20:05.212 --> 20:07.814
- First?
- I had to sell it.

20:07.816 --> 20:09.582
Give me the address
and tell Donna to hurry up.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.318
I'm naked to the world
down here.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.654
Harvey,
there is one problem.

20:14.656 --> 20:16.890
If this woman was involved
in the original cover-up,

20:16.892 --> 20:18.291
she's not gonna want
to talk to a lawyer

20:18.293 --> 20:19.726
who isn't on her side
anymore.

20:19.728 --> 20:22.262
Well, I better think of
something on my way down there.

20:29.403 --> 20:31.604
I went to the file room
to get you the good stapler,

20:31.606 --> 20:33.073
but there was
a bit of a snafu.

20:33.075 --> 20:35.575
- In the file room?
- I don't want to get into it.

20:35.577 --> 20:39.112
In the meantime, I brought you
my own personal stapler,

20:39.114 --> 20:41.915
a two-hole punch, three-hole
punch, old-school wite-out,

20:41.917 --> 20:44.050
and enough highlighters
to last you till kingdom come.

20:44.052 --> 20:45.418
- [Chuckles]
- Look, Harold, I-I know

20:45.420 --> 20:47.787
that you don't see us
as paralegal and associate,

20:47.789 --> 20:49.923
but I think it's best
from now on

20:49.925 --> 20:52.559
that I just help you.

20:52.561 --> 20:54.494
Because the truth--
the truth is,

20:54.496 --> 20:58.565
you are far too valuable
to be wasting your time on this.

20:58.567 --> 21:01.201
I am?

21:01.203 --> 21:02.635
You're right.
Yeah.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.370
And besides, you probably
don't want all this stuff,

21:04.372 --> 21:05.505
anyway.
[Laughs] Well, there's that.

21:05.507 --> 21:06.840
Except for the stapler,
of course.

21:06.842 --> 21:09.342
You got it. Of course.
Thank you. [Chuckles]

21:27.795 --> 21:29.796
Sarah Layton?

21:32.099 --> 21:33.133
You recognize me.

21:33.135 --> 21:34.701
I do.

21:34.703 --> 21:37.370
Then you know
who I work for.

21:37.372 --> 21:38.638
Coastal Motors.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.807
I'm not gonna deny that.

21:42.843 --> 21:43.910
What do you want?

21:43.912 --> 21:45.678
We have a problem.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.782
I need you to tell me everyone
you've ever shown this to.

21:54.655 --> 21:55.889
I never showed it
to anyone.

21:55.891 --> 21:58.158
Ms. Layton,
I don't care that you wrote it.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.859
You made a deal
to keep your mouth shut,

21:59.861 --> 22:01.094
and I believe
you kept it.

22:01.096 --> 22:02.629
All I care about
is who else read it.

22:02.631 --> 22:05.198
I don't know
who else read it...

22:05.200 --> 22:06.466
'Cause I didn't write it.

22:06.468 --> 22:07.867
- Ms. Layton--
- I brought my concerns

22:07.869 --> 22:09.369
to Mr. Kemp.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.671
He told me not to put anything
in writing, and I never did.

22:11.673 --> 22:13.606
Good.

22:13.608 --> 22:15.008
I need you
to swear to me

22:15.010 --> 22:17.076
that you never
told anyone

22:17.078 --> 22:19.212
other than Lawrence Kemp
about the flaws in his hood.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.015
You listen to me.

22:22.017 --> 22:24.083
He promised he'd fix
the problems on the line

22:24.085 --> 22:26.486
if I kept quiet.
He did,

22:26.488 --> 22:29.923
but he never went back and fixed
the ones we already made,

22:29.925 --> 22:31.524
and that man died.

22:31.526 --> 22:35.128
I have been living with that
ever since.

22:35.130 --> 22:38.998
Now get off my property,
and leave me the hell alone.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.614
[Scoffs]

22:54.616 --> 22:57.183
Furniture salesman
to limo driver.

22:57.185 --> 22:58.785
You're stepping up
in the world.

22:58.787 --> 23:00.587
Well, it's nice to know
you still have a sense of humor,

23:00.589 --> 23:03.122
Harvey, considering you just
learned you defended a murderer.

23:03.124 --> 23:05.625
I should've known
you'd have me followed.

23:05.627 --> 23:08.394
Follow you?
I've been waiting for you.

23:08.396 --> 23:10.530
I told you,
you're on the wrong side.

23:10.532 --> 23:11.798
I don't defend murderers.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.934
That's not
what that woman just told you.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.170
You wanted me
to find her.

23:17.172 --> 23:20.273
You have the document.
No proof of fraud.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.375
Can't admit it
without fraud.

23:22.377 --> 23:24.110
Now that you know
Kemp lied on the stand--

23:24.112 --> 23:26.779
I'm obligated to come forward
and tell the court. Otherwise--

23:26.781 --> 23:29.249
Even if you weren't
guilty of fraud then,

23:29.251 --> 23:30.917
you'll be guilty
of fraud now.

23:30.919 --> 23:32.418
Of course,
when you do come forward,

23:32.420 --> 23:33.987
it's going to be awfully hard
for people to believe

23:33.989 --> 23:35.455
you didn't know about it
at the time.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.789
You know
I didn't know.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.391
I don't know
anything of the kind.

23:38.393 --> 23:41.961
What I do know is,
you're in a bind.

23:42.997 --> 23:44.664
I wouldn't wait
too long now.

23:44.666 --> 23:47.400
I'd hate to have to report you
to the bar.

23:58.978 --> 24:00.811
Lawrence goddamn Kemp.

24:00.813 --> 24:02.946
Harvey, I need this suit
quashed, and I need it done now,

24:02.948 --> 24:06.383
so channel your anger
and find a way out.

24:06.385 --> 24:08.452
I mean, I knew I had an enemy
in Tanner, but--

24:08.454 --> 24:10.821
Did you ever think that
the person you should be mad at

24:10.823 --> 24:12.389
is yourself?
Excuse me?

24:12.391 --> 24:14.024
Law 101.

24:14.026 --> 24:15.726
Don't ask your client
if he committed murder,

24:15.728 --> 24:18.061
but sure as hell find out
if there's a smoking gun.

24:18.063 --> 24:20.564
Jessica, I'm sorry,
I wasn't born yesterday,

24:20.566 --> 24:23.200
but he swore to me there was
nothing wrong with that car,

24:23.202 --> 24:24.201
and I believed him.

24:24.203 --> 24:25.769
Well, he lied to you.

24:25.771 --> 24:28.405
It's not the first time,
and it won't be the last,

24:28.407 --> 24:30.674
but now Tanner knows it.

24:30.676 --> 24:32.042
I guess
it's time to tell Daniel.

24:32.044 --> 24:33.543
What? Now?
No.

24:33.545 --> 24:35.612
I just had the chance
to tell him, and I didn't.

24:35.614 --> 24:37.247
- Why not?
- Because you told me not to.

24:37.249 --> 24:39.049
The one time
you listen to me.

24:39.051 --> 24:40.617
No, no, no, no.
You can't lay into me

24:40.619 --> 24:43.020
every time I go against you
and then flip it around now.

24:43.022 --> 24:45.289
We're not telling.
I'm gonna fix it.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.391
Well, the one way to fix it
is to negotiate a settlement.

24:47.393 --> 24:50.560
Oh, wait, we can't
because you got us fired.

24:52.130 --> 24:54.631
I did, which means
there's nothing stopping us

24:54.633 --> 24:55.999
from strong-arming them.

24:56.001 --> 24:59.102
I gotta go.

24:59.104 --> 25:01.271
Just admit it.
Your research suggests

25:01.273 --> 25:04.675
that consumers believe
your water tastes like shit.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.009
Do I have
to answer that?

25:06.011 --> 25:07.444
What exactly
are you getting at, Mr. Litt?

25:07.446 --> 25:09.579
What I'm getting at is,
Mr. Kessler is aware of the fact

25:09.581 --> 25:12.149
that his company's product
can't compete with ours

25:12.151 --> 25:13.483
'cause it tastes
like shit,

25:13.485 --> 25:15.886
and they resorted
to filing a bogus lawsuit

25:15.888 --> 25:18.288
against us in a desperate
attempt to hide that fact.

25:18.290 --> 25:20.891
No, you don't
have to answer that.

25:20.893 --> 25:22.359
Hey, Mike--

25:22.361 --> 25:24.861
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

25:24.863 --> 25:26.530
Kevin, right?

25:26.532 --> 25:28.065
How long have you
worked at Durham Foods?

25:28.067 --> 25:30.534
22 years.
I started right out of college.

25:30.536 --> 25:31.768
That's dedication.

25:31.770 --> 25:34.137
I admire that.

25:34.139 --> 25:35.706
What's your current title?

25:35.708 --> 25:37.541
Vice president
of Market Research.

25:37.543 --> 25:38.875
It says here,
three years ago,

25:38.877 --> 25:41.611
you applied
for senior vice president,

25:41.613 --> 25:45.282
but they gave the job
to an Alan Stansby instead,

25:45.284 --> 25:48.018
a man who had been at the
company far shorter than you.

25:48.020 --> 25:49.252
Correct.

25:49.254 --> 25:50.253
Well, how'd that
make you feel?

25:50.255 --> 25:51.488
Yes or no questions.

25:51.490 --> 25:52.789
My client's not here
to discuss feelings.

25:52.791 --> 25:54.825
Okay, truthfully,
you were hoping to be

25:54.827 --> 25:57.761
further up the corporate ladder
by now, weren't you?

25:57.763 --> 25:59.830
Maybe.

25:59.832 --> 26:01.131
Thank you, Mike.

26:01.133 --> 26:02.366
And once again,

26:02.368 --> 26:05.435
recently you applied
for a senior VP position

26:05.437 --> 26:07.471
and were turned down.
Is that correct?

26:07.473 --> 26:08.939
- Yes.
- You do know that

26:08.941 --> 26:11.808
management is going outside the
company to fill the job, right?

26:11.810 --> 26:13.577
Objection.
Lack of foundation.

26:13.579 --> 26:14.578
You know what?
I am so sorry. That was--

26:14.580 --> 26:16.012
that's off the record.

26:16.014 --> 26:17.214
That's just because of
a headhunter friend of mine--

26:17.216 --> 26:18.615
That's not--no,
we object to that too.

26:18.617 --> 26:19.683
I'm warning you,
Mr. Litt.

26:19.685 --> 26:22.686
I'm sorry.
Statement withdrawn.

26:24.756 --> 26:29.693
You know, you can tow
the party line, Kevin...

26:29.695 --> 26:33.630
but I know exactly

26:33.632 --> 26:36.466
what it's like to bust your ass
every day at a company

26:36.468 --> 26:39.136
and be overlooked for
a promotion time and time again.

26:39.138 --> 26:42.639
It just...

26:42.641 --> 26:44.374
hurts.

26:44.376 --> 26:47.544
Just physically hurts.

26:47.546 --> 26:49.746
Right here.

26:49.748 --> 26:53.917
Give 110% every day,
and for what?

26:53.919 --> 26:58.822
So they can just...
chip away at your dignity?

26:58.824 --> 27:02.826
[Chuckles] You can be the, uh,
loyal soldier today,

27:02.828 --> 27:08.198
be the cannon fodder
for your bosses,

27:08.200 --> 27:10.300
or you can turn the guns on 'em
right now,

27:10.302 --> 27:11.468
and you can just
tell me the truth.

27:11.470 --> 27:12.536
We're done here.

27:12.538 --> 27:14.104
- It's true.
- Kevin.

27:14.106 --> 27:15.772
- Our product sucks.
- No, objection.

27:15.774 --> 27:17.274
You can't object
to your own witness.

27:17.276 --> 27:18.308
We're suing 'cause
we're losing market share.

27:18.310 --> 27:19.576
- Kevin.
- There's nothing wrong

27:19.578 --> 27:24.481
with your ad campaign,
and that's the truth.

27:24.483 --> 27:26.349
Thank you, Kevin.

27:28.286 --> 27:31.188
[Chuckles] Uh, Louis,
that was awesome.

27:31.190 --> 27:32.255
That was pretty spectacular,
wasn't it?

27:32.257 --> 27:33.824
His testimony
is gonna be amazing.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.725
I got him to admit
some damning things, didn't I?

27:35.727 --> 27:37.561
You know, we should subpoena
the outside company

27:37.563 --> 27:38.695
that put together
the focus groups.

27:38.697 --> 27:39.729
- Yes.
- We should get

27:39.731 --> 27:41.231
all their records...
Like it.

27:41.233 --> 27:42.499
And the names and addresses
of the people who took part.

27:42.501 --> 27:43.967
They're protected
in civil actions

27:43.969 --> 27:45.502
under the privacy statute
of '74.

27:45.504 --> 27:47.471
No, that was overturned
by Kressler v. Symtech.

27:47.473 --> 27:49.139
Not if they'd
been compensated,

27:49.141 --> 27:50.340
as is this case
right here.

27:50.342 --> 27:51.875
We're gonna
win this thing. [Laughs]

27:51.877 --> 27:54.644
"If I can't win,
I won't run."

27:54.646 --> 27:55.946
- What?
- "If I can't win,

27:55.948 --> 27:57.747
I won't ru--"
that's <i>Chariots of Fire.</i>

27:57.749 --> 27:59.883
Come on. Do you--don't tell me
you don't know that film.

27:59.885 --> 28:01.451
You know,
like what you and Harvey do,

28:01.453 --> 28:02.486
the--the movie quotes.

28:02.488 --> 28:03.687
I forgot.
It's--yeah.

28:03.689 --> 28:05.155
Well, it's been a long time
since I saw it,

28:05.157 --> 28:06.490
you know. It's a great,
great flick though.

28:06.492 --> 28:07.891
Yeah.

28:07.893 --> 28:09.326
Anyway, all right.
So, um,

28:09.328 --> 28:12.863
make sure the subpoenas
are on my desk in the morning.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.998
Oh, Mike, uh,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.001
make it the afternoon
'cause you've earned it.

28:20.872 --> 28:22.005
[Chuckles]

28:24.509 --> 28:26.510
Good night,
Tommy.

28:30.114 --> 28:31.882
Lawrence,
what a coincidence,

28:31.884 --> 28:33.717
me running into you
in your own building.

28:33.719 --> 28:34.885
I certainly
wasn't waiting for you.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.453
Harvey.

28:36.455 --> 28:37.687
Ah,
it's better this way.

28:37.689 --> 28:39.556
Your new lawyer
won't hear what I have to say

28:39.558 --> 28:41.491
and be put in a position
to commit fraud,

28:41.493 --> 28:43.894
like you did to me.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.763
I don't know what you think
you know, but it's wrong.

28:46.765 --> 28:49.766
I know about
Sarah Layton.

28:54.405 --> 28:57.107
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

28:57.109 --> 29:01.011
But whatever you know, Harvey,
is privileged information.

29:01.013 --> 29:03.914
Not if I found out yesterday,
and definitely not

29:03.916 --> 29:05.916
if you conspired
for me to commit fraud.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.117
There's no fraud.

29:07.119 --> 29:08.852
She found a problem,
and you tried to--

29:08.854 --> 29:11.187
And I fixed it,
and there's no record!

29:11.189 --> 29:13.223
[Grunts]
That's what a solid front end

29:13.225 --> 29:15.559
feels like,
but you didn't make one,

29:15.561 --> 29:18.361
so when Frank Randall's car
hit the divider

29:18.363 --> 29:20.430
at 50 times the force
that you just felt,

29:20.432 --> 29:22.432
it crumpled
and split him in half.

29:22.434 --> 29:23.967
Then I savaged
his reputation,

29:23.969 --> 29:25.569
all because
you looked me in the eye

29:25.571 --> 29:27.871
and told me that your hood
was rock solid.

29:27.873 --> 29:31.441
What do you want,
Harvey?

29:31.443 --> 29:33.243
What you should have done
in the first place.

29:33.245 --> 29:36.413
Pay these people
and make this thing go away.

29:36.415 --> 29:38.448
If you don't,
I'm coming forward

29:38.450 --> 29:41.051
and telling the court
what I know.

29:41.053 --> 29:45.155
Even if I didn't want to,
I'd have to, but I want to,

29:45.157 --> 29:48.258
and when I do, Coastal Motors
is gonna cut you loose

29:48.260 --> 29:50.026
exactly the same way
you did to me,

29:50.028 --> 29:53.229
so either you make it right
on your own, or I will.

29:58.124 --> 29:59.492
Hey, I got the subpoenas.

29:59.582 --> 30:00.948
[Laughs]
I said the afternoon.

30:00.950 --> 30:02.916
It's the first thing
in the morning.

30:02.918 --> 30:04.351
War doesn't wait
for the afternoon.

30:04.353 --> 30:07.521
[Laughs] Sweeter words
have never been spoken.

30:07.523 --> 30:10.724
Gentlemen,
before you do any more work,

30:10.726 --> 30:12.326
Durham Foods
is declaring bankruptcy.

30:12.328 --> 30:13.894
- Yes.
- Damn.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.796
- Damn? We win.
- No, now if there's a judgment

30:15.798 --> 30:17.064
on the countersuit,
we're gonna be

30:17.066 --> 30:18.932
in the back of the line
behind a dozen lenders.

30:18.934 --> 30:22.035
Sorry. I know you've been
working on this for weeks.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.940
Uh, yeah. Yeah, well,
what are you gonna do?

30:31.279 --> 30:32.646
We can still get a win-win out
of this whole thing.

30:32.648 --> 30:33.981
- How?
- Well, you said that

30:33.983 --> 30:36.116
their other products are
worth real money, right?

30:36.118 --> 30:38.352
So why don't we just
advise Liquid Water

30:38.354 --> 30:41.555
to buy the whole company
and then just give up the suit?

30:41.557 --> 30:43.490
We kill the competition
and get their other products

30:43.492 --> 30:45.158
at a discount
to market value.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.161
- Win.
- Win.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.475
Why'd you cover
for me?

31:01.477 --> 31:02.476
What do you mean?

31:02.478 --> 31:04.344
With Hardman
out there.

31:04.346 --> 31:06.580
You let him think
that we were working together.

31:06.582 --> 31:09.182
In the deposition yesterday
when you were--

31:09.184 --> 31:12.219
you know, when you were
talking about not--

31:12.221 --> 31:14.221
[sighs]

31:14.223 --> 31:16.156
I've just really enjoyed
working with you, Louis.

31:16.158 --> 31:18.425
- You have?
- Yeah, sure.

31:18.427 --> 31:20.961
[Laughs]

31:20.963 --> 31:23.764
Well, I thought Harvey
might have poisoned the well

31:23.766 --> 31:27.668
in regards to any relationship
between the two of us.

31:27.670 --> 31:29.036
Louis,
can I be honest with you?

31:29.038 --> 31:30.704
- Yeah, I can keep it real.
- As far as

31:30.706 --> 31:33.373
poisoning the well goes,

31:33.375 --> 31:36.209
Harvey didn't really
have anything to do with it.

31:36.211 --> 31:38.078
That's pretty much
all been you.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.579
What are you
talking about?

31:39.581 --> 31:41.181
Among other things,

31:41.183 --> 31:45.118
you tried to sabotage
my relationship with Jenny.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.120
After you laughed
at that video of me.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.555
You stuck me
in housing court.

31:48.557 --> 31:49.923
'Cause you stole a client
from me.

31:49.925 --> 31:51.959
You tried to blackmail me
with a fake drug test.

31:51.961 --> 31:53.560
Yeah,
but it didn't work.

31:53.562 --> 31:55.195
You defeated me.
So?

31:55.197 --> 31:56.863
So it's water
under the bridge.

31:56.865 --> 31:59.599
[Laughs] No, no, no.
Not water under the bridge.

31:59.601 --> 32:01.401
Louis, you can't do that
to people and expect them

32:01.403 --> 32:04.137
to forget about it and move on.
Don't you get that?

32:04.139 --> 32:07.140
- They should.
- Would you?

32:11.145 --> 32:12.546
Okay.

32:12.548 --> 32:17.684
Mike, I will take
your thoughts...

32:17.686 --> 32:21.755
on my behavior
under advisement.

32:24.959 --> 32:26.793
Wait, Mike?
Yeah?

32:26.795 --> 32:31.999
Something's in the air still.
Like a pall of secrecy

32:32.001 --> 32:33.734
or a layer of unease.

32:33.736 --> 32:35.736
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:35.738 --> 32:37.604
Mm, my spider parts
are tingling.

32:37.606 --> 32:39.439
Please don't ever
say things like that.

32:39.441 --> 32:43.343
Harvey's up to something.
I know it. What is he up to?

32:43.345 --> 32:45.412
[Laughs]

32:45.414 --> 32:48.115
I don't know.

32:48.117 --> 32:50.684
- You sure?
- Yes.

33:03.031 --> 33:05.866
Um, Louis's parts
are tingling.

33:05.868 --> 33:08.502
I don't want to know what
that means or how you know that.

33:08.504 --> 33:10.103
It means he knows
you're hiding something.

33:10.105 --> 33:12.039
Well, if everything goes
like I expect,

33:12.041 --> 33:13.340
there won't be
anything to hide.

33:13.342 --> 33:15.075
Good, because it just
doesn't feel right lying.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.777
You know, I actually kind of
like working with him.

33:16.779 --> 33:17.978
He's not a bad lawyer.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.113
I mean, you know,
we have fun.

33:20.115 --> 33:22.716
You guys thinking about
moving in together?

33:22.718 --> 33:24.618
Jealous?

33:25.887 --> 33:27.687
Where's your gatekeeper?

33:27.689 --> 33:30.590
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry
can just waltz right in.

33:30.592 --> 33:33.326
Well, I don't see
any Toms or Harrys here, but--

33:33.328 --> 33:35.062
Okay, can we just please
cut the small talk

33:35.064 --> 33:36.963
and you let me know
what I'm not privy to?

33:36.965 --> 33:38.465
I don't know
what imaginary world

33:38.467 --> 33:40.133
you're skipping through
right now, Louis,

33:40.135 --> 33:42.803
but you're there
all by yourself.

33:42.805 --> 33:44.838
Right.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.973
So first you hand me Ross
on a silver platter,

33:46.975 --> 33:48.575
then Donna's not at her desk
for days.

33:48.577 --> 33:50.577
You think that I don't know
that there's a power struggle

33:50.579 --> 33:52.546
going on
between Jessica and Hardman?

33:54.048 --> 33:57.284
Harvey, look,

33:57.286 --> 34:01.521
I admit I haven't
always been, um...

34:01.523 --> 34:04.925
well-behaved,

34:04.927 --> 34:08.594
but I can help you on this.
You just gotta trust me.

34:08.597 --> 34:12.532
Louis, go away.

34:19.974 --> 34:22.141
- That was harsh.
- You kidding me?

34:22.143 --> 34:23.844
He came hat in hand,
Harvey.

34:23.846 --> 34:26.012
Have you met him?
This guy gets one whiff

34:26.014 --> 34:27.746
of what we've been hiding
from Hardman,

34:27.748 --> 34:30.183
I guarantee you it's his office
he's in, not ours.

34:30.185 --> 34:32.284
I know,
we can't trust him.

34:32.286 --> 34:34.154
Still, you should have seen him
in this deposition.

34:34.156 --> 34:35.722
I mean, all he wants
is to be you.

34:35.724 --> 34:36.989
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

34:36.992 --> 34:38.391
- I'm serious, Harvey.
- Well, I'm sorry.

34:38.393 --> 34:40.193
That's just pathetic.
I know, but what I'm-

34:40.195 --> 34:42.362
[phone ringing]
- Harvey Specter.

34:42.364 --> 34:45.364
Harvey, it's Lawrence Kemp.
Give 'em what they want.

34:45.367 --> 34:47.300
- Good.
- Is that it?

34:47.302 --> 34:48.702
You want a medal?

34:48.704 --> 34:50.504
For what it's worth,
I never meant

34:50.505 --> 34:52.639
to put your reputation
on the line,

34:52.641 --> 34:54.474
and that memo
never crossed my desk.

34:54.476 --> 34:55.742
Goodbye, Lawrence.

34:55.744 --> 34:57.244
They're settling?
You wanted that?

34:57.246 --> 34:59.146
Wanted it?
I goddamn orchestrated it.

34:59.148 --> 35:01.047
CM pays what they should have
in the first place.

35:01.049 --> 35:02.449
And the suit against us
goes away.

35:02.451 --> 35:04.251
And Daniel Hardman's
none the wiser.

35:04.253 --> 35:05.252
Where the hell's Donna?

35:05.254 --> 35:06.987
She's in the file room.

35:06.989 --> 35:08.922
Hasn't found
that document yet.

35:11.826 --> 35:13.160
There is no document.

35:13.162 --> 35:14.928
So you believe him?

35:14.930 --> 35:18.865
Not really. I just remember
who we're dealing with.

35:26.941 --> 35:28.942
Harvey.

35:30.444 --> 35:32.479
What are you doing here?

35:32.481 --> 35:36.516
Nothing. Just delivered
CM's settlement offer to Smith.

35:36.518 --> 35:38.485
Or Devane.

35:38.487 --> 35:40.353
I can't remember,
I can't tell those guys apart.

35:40.355 --> 35:41.721
It's not their case.

35:41.723 --> 35:44.624
No, but it is their firm,
and I don't trust you.

35:44.626 --> 35:46.493
Our offer
was take it or leave it.

35:46.495 --> 35:48.728
Well, we took it.
And now we're done.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.030
Hmm, well,
I'm afraid there's still

35:50.032 --> 35:52.132
the little matter
of our fraud claim against you.

35:52.134 --> 35:54.601
Tanner, I'm glad you did
what you did.

35:54.603 --> 35:56.469
The Randall family
deserved that money,

35:56.471 --> 35:58.371
but let's not pretend
you've got shit on me.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.573
Excuse me?

35:59.575 --> 36:01.708
You used that memo
to get what you wanted,

36:01.710 --> 36:04.477
but it never would have held up
in court because you wrote it.

36:04.479 --> 36:06.746
That's
a scintillating argument.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.215
Too bad
not a word of it's true.

36:08.217 --> 36:09.849
Well, let's take a look
at your resume.

36:09.851 --> 36:12.552
Witness tampering,
extortion, bribery.

36:12.554 --> 36:14.054
Forgery fits right in.

36:14.056 --> 36:16.389
That document's
the real deal, Harv,

36:16.391 --> 36:18.058
and as far as
reputations go,

36:18.060 --> 36:21.761
I know all about your dirty
dealings in the D.A.'s office.

36:21.763 --> 36:25.131
Unlike your theories about me,
you were actually investigated

36:25.133 --> 36:28.501
for the very thing you're being
accused of, burying evidence--

36:28.503 --> 36:30.870
a point I can't wait
to bring up in court.

36:30.872 --> 36:32.839
You're the one
with the problem, Harv.

36:32.841 --> 36:35.075
You know
I didn't do this.

36:35.077 --> 36:37.377
Hey, thanks for settling
the case for me, buddy,

36:37.379 --> 36:39.179
but I said I wanted
a pound of flesh

36:39.181 --> 36:44.050
from CM and you,
and I meant it.

36:44.052 --> 36:46.086
- That was harsh.
- You kidding me?

36:46.088 --> 36:47.687
He came hat in hand,
Harvey.

36:47.689 --> 36:49.923
Have you met him?
This guy gets one whiff

36:49.925 --> 36:51.625
of what we've been hiding
from Hardman,

36:51.627 --> 36:53.994
I guarantee you it's his office
he's in, not ours.

36:53.996 --> 36:56.162
I know,
we can't trust him.

36:56.164 --> 36:57.998
Still, you should have seen him
in this deposition.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.633
I mean, all he wants
is to be you.

36:59.635 --> 37:00.700
Isn't that
what everybody wants?

37:00.702 --> 37:01.868
I'm serious, Harvey.

37:01.870 --> 37:03.036
I'm sorry,
that's just pathetic.

37:03.038 --> 37:04.337
I know,
but what I'm--

37:04.339 --> 37:05.805
[recorder beeps off]
- Bothering you?

37:05.807 --> 37:09.342
No.
No, not at all.

37:09.344 --> 37:10.644
I heard about
your proposal

37:10.646 --> 37:12.746
to buy Durham Foods
out of bankruptcy.

37:12.748 --> 37:13.847
Impressive.

37:13.849 --> 37:16.216
Well, the way I see it
is a win-win.

37:16.218 --> 37:19.252
Way to think
outside the box.

37:19.254 --> 37:21.755
It was actually
Mike Ross's idea.

37:21.757 --> 37:23.757
I'm glad to see
it all worked out.

37:29.196 --> 37:32.866
Louis...

37:32.868 --> 37:36.469
you seem upset
about something.

37:36.471 --> 37:39.472
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

37:47.642 --> 37:49.877
Jessica Pearson,
leading by example.

37:49.879 --> 37:52.279
Spare me the charm, Harvey.
Give it to me straight.

37:52.281 --> 37:54.749
CM settled.
$46 million.

37:54.751 --> 37:56.684
1/3 to Frank Randall's widow,

37:56.686 --> 37:59.053
the rest into a blind trust
for his children.

37:59.055 --> 38:00.221
You're pleased
with that?

38:00.223 --> 38:01.422
Damn straight I am.

38:01.424 --> 38:03.290
When's the other shoe
gonna drop?

38:03.292 --> 38:04.925
What makes you think
there's another shoe?

38:04.927 --> 38:08.095
It's Tanner.
There's always another shoe.

38:08.097 --> 38:11.032
They're still
coming after us for fraud.

38:11.034 --> 38:13.401
It's time
to pay the Piper.

38:13.403 --> 38:15.403
You want to tell him,
or shall I?

38:15.405 --> 38:18.706
Well, we'll worry
about that tomorrow.

38:18.708 --> 38:20.374
What the hell gives you two
the right

38:20.376 --> 38:22.410
to hide a lawsuit
against my firm from me?

38:22.412 --> 38:26.347
- Daniel--
- I am not done yet.

38:26.349 --> 38:29.817
When were you planning on
telling me this?

38:29.819 --> 38:31.318
When the case
went to court?

38:31.320 --> 38:35.122
When our malpractice insurance
ran out?

38:35.124 --> 38:37.625
Are the two of you
so shortsighted

38:37.627 --> 38:40.194
that you would allow
your distaste of me

38:40.196 --> 38:43.998
to impair your ability
to run this firm?

38:44.000 --> 38:49.136
When you came five years ago
to blackmail me, I was furious.

38:49.138 --> 38:53.107
You told me that I was
blaming you for my own actions.

38:53.109 --> 38:55.609
I wasn't just embezzling,
but I also tried to cover it up.

38:55.611 --> 38:57.745
Well, that's what you were
so busy doing

38:57.747 --> 38:59.046
the other morning,
covering it up.

38:59.048 --> 39:00.514
You had the chance to tell me,
and you didn't.

39:00.516 --> 39:01.949
- No, I didn't.
- Why?

39:01.951 --> 39:03.384
I don't trust you.

39:03.386 --> 39:04.718
That's not true.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.155
He didn't tell you
because I don't trust you.

39:08.157 --> 39:10.591
Tell me you're not gonna
use this as some power play.

39:10.593 --> 39:13.260
That's exactly
what I should do,

39:13.262 --> 39:14.662
but I am gonna
give you the chance

39:14.664 --> 39:16.764
I have been asking you
to give me,

39:16.766 --> 39:18.833
the chance
to redeem yourself.

39:18.835 --> 39:20.000
How?

39:20.002 --> 39:22.303
They're not just
coming after you.

39:22.305 --> 39:25.673
They're coming after
all of us.

39:25.675 --> 39:29.076
Pearson. Hardman.

39:29.078 --> 39:30.678
What are you proposing?

39:30.680 --> 39:33.647
We fight them
together.

39:35.183 --> 39:37.351
Okay.

39:42.390 --> 39:44.992
You trust him?

39:44.994 --> 39:47.995
At the moment,
we don't really have a choice.

39:53.535 --> 39:56.837
[Clears throat]
Looking good, Louis.

40:00.175 --> 40:02.176
You're supposed to say,
"feeling good, Billy Ray."

40:02.178 --> 40:05.579
You know, <i>Trading Places.</i>
<i>Movie quotes, it's what we do.</i>

40:05.581 --> 40:07.181
You want something?

40:07.183 --> 40:09.216
[Chuckles] Uh, well,
I just heard

40:09.218 --> 40:11.585
that you ran with my idea
about buying out Durham Foods,

40:11.587 --> 40:13.787
and Hardman told me
you gave me the credit,

40:13.789 --> 40:17.024
so...
Team Litt-Ross.

40:19.928 --> 40:22.096
I told him because I don't
like to owe anyone anything.

40:22.098 --> 40:25.699
You covered for me with him
earlier, so I threw you a bone.

40:25.701 --> 40:27.468
Now we're even.
Where's this coming from?

40:27.470 --> 40:28.802
I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

40:28.804 --> 40:30.971
You were right.
Actions have impact.

40:30.973 --> 40:35.276
So you want to remember
the marijuana and tennis thing?

40:35.278 --> 40:38.279
Well, I'm gonna
remember things too.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.495
How's your budding bro-mance
with Louis?

40:54.497 --> 40:56.397
Evidently,
it's over.

40:56.399 --> 40:58.599
So fickle is the heart.

40:58.601 --> 41:02.403
What's going on with you?
Why are you being so...weird?

41:02.405 --> 41:04.171
Tanner took the deal.

41:04.173 --> 41:05.406
So it's done.

41:05.408 --> 41:08.442
No. He's still
coming after me for fraud,

41:08.444 --> 41:10.644
and a lot of people are gonna
think I buried that document.

41:10.646 --> 41:12.279
How can you bury
what doesn't exist?

41:12.281 --> 41:13.747
Doesn't matter.

41:13.749 --> 41:18.619
They'll think it happened once,
it could happen again.

41:18.621 --> 41:21.422
So why are you smiling?

41:21.424 --> 41:24.325
Because I know
what they don't.

41:24.327 --> 41:26.694
You're gonna
beat Tanner.

41:26.696 --> 41:30.564
I'm not just gonna beat him.
When I'm done with him,

41:30.566 --> 41:33.701
his own mother
won't even recognize him.

41:55.357 --> 41:57.424
Ah, that's where you are.
I've been looking for you.

41:57.426 --> 42:00.995
[Sighs]

42:00.997 --> 42:03.597
You okay? You look like
you're gonna be sick.

42:03.599 --> 42:05.699
Oh, God, you know,
actually, I do,

42:05.701 --> 42:07.268
I feel like
I'm coming down with something.

42:07.270 --> 42:09.470
Do you think that maybe
you could grab me a water?

42:09.472 --> 42:11.739
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
