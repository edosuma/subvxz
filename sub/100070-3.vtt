01:07.460 --> 01:10.459
- Martin?
- Good morning.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.459
I have to take your temperature.

01:12.460 --> 01:15.459
Why? Has something just happened?

01:15.460 --> 01:17.459
We need to track your
Basal body temperature,

01:17.460 --> 01:20.824
so that we know
when you're ovulating.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.819
It's 6:45.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.459
Mm-hm. The reading's most accurate
immediately after waking.

01:26.460 --> 01:29.459
Is this absolutely necessary
right now?

01:29.460 --> 01:32.659
Yes, we're going
to do this every morning.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.459
I missed
most of your last pregnancy.

01:34.460 --> 01:38.188
I want to be
fully involved with this one.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.460
God's sake.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.459
Get off there!

02:15.460 --> 02:17.459
Good morning, James.

02:17.460 --> 02:20.459
I'm going to need
this area tomorrow, if that's OK.

02:20.460 --> 02:21.460
What for?

02:21.461 --> 02:23.499
Well, Sam's coming over,
with my tutorial group.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.659
We're taking turns
doing presentations

02:25.660 --> 02:28.659
- and this week it's me and Tony.
- Who's Tony?

02:28.660 --> 02:30.459
He's one of the other students.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.459
Don't you have a college
for that sort of thing?

02:32.460 --> 02:34.459
Yeah, but Sam likes to
keep it informal.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.459
It's part of his teaching method.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.459
What's in the notebook?

02:38.460 --> 02:40.459
Er, I'm using it
to record your temperatures.

02:40.460 --> 02:43.459
- I was gonna put up a wall chart...
- No, thank... Notebook's fine.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.819
Yeah. Mm-hm.

02:44.820 --> 02:48.459
Oh, I forgot to tell you, that
Ruth's agreed to babysit on Friday.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.459
- Because?
- Because it's your birthday.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.460
I don't celebrate my birthday.

02:52.461 --> 02:54.499
Yes, I know, but I thought
it'd be nice to this time.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.459
So, I've booked us a table
at the fish place on the Platt.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.459
Oh.

02:59.460 --> 03:03.979
- Or I could cook at home.
- Yes, I'd like that.

03:03.980 --> 03:05.459
Yeah, well, I'll cancel Ruth, then.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.820
- OK.
- OK.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.819
So, you're saying someone broke in?

03:12.820 --> 03:14.459
Well, the door was open.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.819
My things have been moved around
and my purse is missing.

03:17.820 --> 03:19.459
There's no sign of forced entry.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.459
- Did you see anyone?
- No.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.460
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

03:22.461 --> 03:26.459
- How long was the door open for?
- I don't know.

03:26.460 --> 03:29.459
You're not making this
very easy for me.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.915
But don't worry, I'm on it.

03:41.460 --> 03:44.459
- Is that a bag of rubbish?
- Yes.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.370
You'll need to leave it outside.

03:47.460 --> 03:52.188
It's terrible what folk leave
strewn about the beach.

03:54.820 --> 03:58.459
Shh.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.460
What's in your pocket?

04:05.460 --> 04:08.459
- It's a finch.
- Where did you get that?

04:08.460 --> 04:09.659
Next patient.

04:09.660 --> 04:12.460
- That's me.
- Go through.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.459
- Doc...
- Yes?

04:18.459 --> 04:21.096
- Never mind.
- Waste of time.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.459
Take a seat.

04:25.460 --> 04:28.459
Did you know
I moved next door to your aunt?

04:28.460 --> 04:30.459
Is that what you came
to see me about?

04:30.460 --> 04:32.459
No. I was making conversation.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.459
Right. What can I do for you?

04:35.460 --> 04:38.459
My HRT implant, I think
it's time to get it replaced.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.979
Not been feeling so good,
so I imagine it's run out.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.499
Hmm, well, the last one
was three months ago.

04:42.500 --> 04:48.319
I can do that for you now. Get
onto the examination table please.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.459
I'll apply a local anaesthetic.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.459
I will make a small incision
at the top of you buttock

04:54.460 --> 04:57.459
- and insert your new implant.
- Amazing what medical science can do.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.460
Stop talking.

04:58.461 --> 05:03.916
Roll onto your side and loosen
the top of your skirt, please.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.460
Oh.

05:16.820 --> 05:20.299
Normally, I'd recommend
that you don't bathe for 24 hours,

05:20.300 --> 05:24.846
but in your case,
that doesn't seem to be an issue.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.460
Right, get dressed.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.499
- How did that get in here?
- I found him injured at the beach.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.459
I was gonna take him
up to the vet's later.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.459
You can't bring an animal in here.

05:45.460 --> 05:48.459
- Well, you have a dog outside.
- Well, that's completely different.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.460
This is a wild animal,

05:49.461 --> 05:52.459
it doesn't belong
in a doctor's surgery.

05:52.460 --> 05:56.459
Careful, Doc. He can't fly.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.459
Oh.

05:58.460 --> 06:00.188
He looks all right.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.459
Here you are.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.460
Now, before you go,

06:04.461 --> 06:08.459
may I interest you in signing
Dr Ellingham's birthday card?

06:08.460 --> 06:11.459
- Not really.
- Everybody else has.

06:11.460 --> 06:14.370
- Oh.
- Suppose it wouldn't hurt.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.459
Most of these say,
"Happy birthday, tosser."

06:19.460 --> 06:21.460
No, they don't.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.459
Why would they do that?

06:25.460 --> 06:28.139
I could give it a guess.

06:28.140 --> 06:30.459
What, after all he's done
for these people?

06:30.460 --> 06:32.459
You can leave. Go on. Get out.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.460
Out. Get out. Go!

06:39.500 --> 06:42.459
- You missed a bit.
- Can I help you, Joe?

06:42.460 --> 06:44.459
Official business.

06:44.460 --> 06:47.459
Did you notice anyone strange
in your pub last night?

06:47.460 --> 06:50.459
- Strange as in what way?
- Strange.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.459
Like they were planning a break-in.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.459
And what does someone planning
a break-in look like?

06:55.460 --> 06:57.459
I don't know,
that's why I'm asking you.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.459
Someone broke into Ruth's,
stole her purse.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.460
Oh, no.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.459
That's terrible. Erm, I'm sorry.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.139
No-one comes to mind, no.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.459
Question number two.

07:09.460 --> 07:13.459
Have you made a decision
about your best man being me?

07:13.460 --> 07:15.459
I don't want to talk
about the wedding, Joe.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.459
Touchy subject?
That was a weak proposal.

07:17.460 --> 07:20.459
- You should do it again.
- I should propose again?

07:20.460 --> 07:23.659
Yeah. Throw her
a surprise engagement party.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.459
Show her how much you care.

07:26.460 --> 07:28.459
That's actually not a bad idea, Joe.

07:28.460 --> 07:32.824
The sort of good idea
only a best man could have.

07:36.460 --> 07:39.459
Oh. I didn't know you had a baby.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.459
No, it's for my...

07:41.460 --> 07:43.459
my grandchildren.
They're staying with me.

07:43.460 --> 07:46.459
- Oh, that sounds nice.
- It is, they're lovely.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.459
They rely on you.
You get to watch them change and...

07:50.460 --> 07:51.460
And grow.

07:51.461 --> 07:55.280
It's the most wonderful thing
in the world.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.459
Hang on.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.499
- You live next door
to Ruth Ellingham. - And?

08:01.500 --> 08:04.459
- Have you noticed anything
suspicious going on? - No.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.299
- Any unusual behaviour.
- No.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.846
Well, if you do notice anything,
I'll...

08:13.460 --> 08:15.459
Pack of ibuprofen, please.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.459
- My headache's got a headache.
- Certainly.

08:17.460 --> 08:20.459
Care to sign the card
for Dr Ellingham?

08:20.460 --> 08:21.460
When's his big day?

08:21.461 --> 08:23.459
Oh, according
to the birth records...

08:23.460 --> 08:27.459
Wh... Which I stumbled across
purely by chance,

08:27.460 --> 08:32.279
- it's in two days.
- Lot of correction fluid on this.

08:32.460 --> 08:37.642
You can draft yours first
with a pencil, pending approval.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.499
I'll make an appointment for you.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.458
Al!

08:43.460 --> 08:46.459
- Morwenna. Hey, all right.
- What you doing here?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.459
Oh, I just came to see the doc,
actually.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.459
- Oh, why? What's wrong with you?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.459
So why do you need to see the doc?

08:52.460 --> 08:54.459
Erm... Blood pressure.
I need a blood pressure check.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.459
- There's no appointment in the diary.
- Really?

08:57.460 --> 09:00.139
I must have forgotten to do it,
been so busy.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.459
It'll only take a second.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.459
Er.. Well,
he's got five minutes now,

09:04.460 --> 09:05.819
if you're quick.

09:05.820 --> 09:07.979
OK, thank you.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.460
Thank you.

09:12.460 --> 09:13.460
Come.

09:13.461 --> 09:16.459
I need you to check
my blood pressure, Doc.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.499
Your appointment's
not due for another month.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.459
Yeah, well, better safe than sorry,
though, eh?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.370
Why are you shouting?

09:23.500 --> 09:25.459
Sorry, Doc...

09:25.460 --> 09:29.459
Actually, I, erm...
I wanted to ask a favour.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.460
Yes.

09:31.500 --> 09:35.979
So I'm throwing Morwenna
a surprise engagement party

09:35.980 --> 09:38.299
at the pub on Friday.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.459
I was wondering if you could
keep her at work for an extra hour,

09:41.460 --> 09:43.459
while I get it all set up.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.459
Er, that'll be a bit inconvenient.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.459
Well, OK, Doc,
I wouldn't usually ask,

09:47.460 --> 09:50.459
but I really, really need it
to be a surprise.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.459
OK, you see I've messed up
with Morwenna, big time...

09:53.460 --> 09:55.979
And you of all people know
what that's like.

09:55.980 --> 09:58.819
So, I'm gonna use the party
to propose again properly,

09:58.820 --> 10:00.459
and make it all up to her.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.459
Please, Doc...

10:02.460 --> 10:04.979
Erm, yes, I suppose so, all right.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.459
Ah, you're a life-saver.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.459
Obviously, you and Louisa
are invited to the party, too.

10:09.460 --> 10:12.459
Er, thank you, but, no.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.499
Oh, OK.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
Well, thanks anyway...

10:16.660 --> 10:18.459
Oh, er, how's Ruth, by the way?

10:18.460 --> 10:21.459
She's fine. Thank you. Why?

10:21.460 --> 10:23.459
I heard she got broken into.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.299
What? When? Is she all right?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.459
Oh. I'm sure it's nothing.

10:28.460 --> 10:30.459
It's good news
about the blood pressure.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.819
Really glad I came
for my bimonthly check.

10:32.820 --> 10:35.459
Thanks, Doc. See ya!

10:35.460 --> 10:38.459
Morwenna, I need to step out
for half an hour.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.733
Is everything OK with Al?

10:44.140 --> 10:45.300
Yes.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.459
So, if I could just
take some details.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.459
When did the robbery take place?

10:52.460 --> 10:55.459
- This morning.
- Excellent.

10:55.460 --> 11:00.299
I mean, excellent that you're able
to contact the police so swiftly.

11:00.300 --> 11:03.459
- And how many mackerel were taken?
- About half my catch.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.459
Great.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.459
I mean...

11:07.460 --> 11:08.460
Thank you.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.460
Oh, God.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.460
Oh, God.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.460
Go away. Go away.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.459
- Martin?
- I heard you were burgled.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.499
Oh, I must have forgotten
to lock the door.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.459
Are you all right?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.459
Apart from missing my purse,
I'll survive.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.459
Have you cancelled
your credit cards?

11:38.460 --> 11:40.499
- Not yet.
- What about the locks?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.459
Have you arranged to get
those changed?

11:42.460 --> 11:45.459
Martin, could we have the questions
some other time,

11:45.460 --> 11:46.460
- I was having a lie down.
- Yes, all right.

11:46.461 --> 11:49.299
Don't forget you've got your
bone-density test tomorrow.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.819
- What time's the appointment?
- Er, 10:30.

11:51.820 --> 11:53.459
What are all these cats doing here?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.459
Oh, it's Paula, next door.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.459
She keeps putting food
out for them.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.459
It's very irritating.

11:59.460 --> 12:03.279
- I'll see you tomorrow, then.
- All right.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.460
Disgusting.

12:05.460 --> 12:08.733
Oh, God, go away. Go on.
Stupid cats.

12:13.881 --> 12:17.880
- Ruth, how can I help you?
- Erm...

12:17.881 --> 12:20.920
Paracetamol and, erm, codeine,
please.

12:20.921 --> 12:24.880
Would you like to sign
Dr Ellingham's birthday card?

12:24.881 --> 12:28.154
Ellinghams
don't really do birthdays.

12:28.921 --> 12:31.880
I'll just fetch your tablets.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.880
Ruth, I was just coming to see you.

12:33.881 --> 12:35.880
You won't need to come over
on Friday any more.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.880
Come over for what?

12:37.881 --> 12:39.560
Erm, I did mention it the other day.

12:39.561 --> 12:41.880
I was planning something
for Martin's birthday,

12:41.881 --> 12:43.080
you were gonna babysit...

12:43.081 --> 12:45.880
Oh, right. Yes. Yes, of course.

12:45.881 --> 12:47.880
It's fine,
cos we're staying home now.

12:47.881 --> 12:50.880
Oh, are you
cooking something special?

12:50.881 --> 12:52.880
Well, I haven't decided yet.

12:52.881 --> 12:55.880
Well, I could always rustle up
something nice for you,

12:55.881 --> 12:58.400
and bring it round, if you like?

12:58.401 --> 13:00.880
I know cooking's not your forte.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.880
I'll be fine, thank you,
Mrs Tishell.

13:02.881 --> 13:04.880
Suit yourself.

13:04.881 --> 13:06.880
That'll be £2.50, please.

13:06.881 --> 13:08.880
I had to raid the change jar.

13:08.881 --> 13:09.881
Erm...

13:13.241 --> 13:14.721
Erm...

13:17.881 --> 13:19.880
Take what you want.

13:19.881 --> 13:22.154
I'll see you later, Ruth.

13:25.881 --> 13:29.720
So, we'll have a buffet there,
balloons here...

13:29.721 --> 13:30.920
- We could get a band in.
- Nice.

13:30.921 --> 13:33.880
- What about a champagne fountain?
- Oh, they're lovely.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.880
I'm going to have one
at my engagement party.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.880
Who are you gonna marry?

13:37.881 --> 13:38.881
I don't know yet.

13:38.882 --> 13:43.880
So band, buffet, champagne fountain,
what do we think about a magician?

13:43.881 --> 13:45.880
I'm pretty sure Morwenna
would like a magician.

13:45.881 --> 13:46.881
Joe, enough.

13:46.882 --> 13:49.880
What? You said I could organise
your engagement party.

13:49.881 --> 13:50.881
Er, number one, I didn't.

13:50.882 --> 13:53.720
And number two, do you want to
shout about it a bit louder?

13:53.721 --> 13:54.880
It's supposed to be a surprise.

13:54.881 --> 13:57.880
We just want what's best for you,
proper job.

13:57.881 --> 14:00.880
All I need is a few people,
a few drinks, and the girl I love.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.881
- That's it.
- Aw.

14:03.881 --> 14:06.880
So, she agreed to babysit
and then completely forgot?

14:06.881 --> 14:09.880
It was like it was
the first she'd heard about it.

14:09.881 --> 14:12.720
You'd prescribe benzodiazepines
for anxiety, wouldn't you?

14:12.721 --> 14:14.400
No, Ruth doesn't suffer
from anxiety.

14:14.401 --> 14:16.880
- No, it's for my presentation.
- What's it on?

14:16.881 --> 14:18.880
Anxiety cycles in teenagers.

14:18.881 --> 14:21.400
I completely re-wrote
the final section this morning,

14:21.401 --> 14:22.880
I really felt like I was on a roll.

14:22.881 --> 14:24.880
Any anxiety medication
should be prescribed

14:24.881 --> 14:27.240
with extreme caution,
and after a careful consultation,

14:27.241 --> 14:29.880
you can become dependent on them
very quickly and easily.

14:29.881 --> 14:32.720
Ruth was struggling to pick out
the coins to pay, too.

14:32.721 --> 14:34.880
Was she?
I'm going to see her tomorrow.

14:34.881 --> 14:37.240
And I ran into Al,
he told me about the party.

14:37.241 --> 14:39.080
That was so nice of you
to say you'll help him.

14:39.081 --> 14:41.880
Well, I just said I'll keep her here
for an extra hour.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.400
Well, how are you gonna do that?

14:43.401 --> 14:45.880
By telling her I need to review
her knowledge as a first responder.

14:45.881 --> 14:47.880
Open.

14:47.881 --> 14:49.880
That's not bad, actually.

14:49.881 --> 14:52.880
Why don't we go along
for half an hour, before dinner?

14:52.881 --> 14:55.880
- Really? - Well, I reckon
it'd mean a lot to her.

14:55.881 --> 14:57.880
30 minutes, then we can leave.

14:57.881 --> 15:00.972
I'll see if Mel's free to babysit.

15:01.881 --> 15:03.880
Are we planning an early night,
then?

15:03.881 --> 15:06.336
Nope. You're not ovulating.

15:33.881 --> 15:35.880
Ruth. Is everything all right?

15:35.881 --> 15:38.560
I heard a noise from inside.

15:38.561 --> 15:39.880
Like a baby crying.

15:39.881 --> 15:44.560
- Maybe it was the television.
- It didn't sound like the television.

15:44.561 --> 15:46.720
Maybe you're hearing things, then.

15:46.721 --> 15:49.812
It's quite late, so... good night.

16:00.881 --> 16:03.720
- What are they?
- Hmm, what are those?

16:03.721 --> 16:05.880
Biscuits for my tutorial group.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.245
- Would you like one?
- No, thank you.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.880
I thought you were giving
a presentation,

16:11.881 --> 16:14.880
- not a cookery lesson.
- Well, I am, but to be honest,

16:14.881 --> 16:16.880
I've really struggled to fit in
with this class.

16:16.881 --> 16:18.880
You know, they're always
on their phones,

16:18.881 --> 16:20.880
or texting each other,
even when they're in the same room.

16:20.881 --> 16:23.400
It's... Oh, I don't know.

16:23.401 --> 16:25.080
I just want this to go well.

16:25.081 --> 16:29.880
So I thought I'd make some sort of
horrible biscuits.

16:29.881 --> 16:33.720
Hmm. Well, I'm sure
you'll get on fine.

16:33.721 --> 16:34.881
Thank you.

16:37.881 --> 16:39.245
Morning, Paula.

16:41.881 --> 16:45.880
Ruth, I want to apologise
for last night.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.560
Why? What happened?

16:47.561 --> 16:49.834
You came round, remember?

16:51.881 --> 16:53.880
Did I mention about the cats?

16:53.881 --> 16:55.880
Because you know
they're everywhere now,

16:55.881 --> 16:57.880
since you moved in.
It's a real nuisance.

16:57.881 --> 16:59.880
Animals have rights, too.

16:59.881 --> 17:04.972
They don't have the right
to use my garden as a lavatory.

17:07.881 --> 17:10.560
Ah, Ruth.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.400
I've successfully found your purse.

17:13.401 --> 17:15.880
- Where did you find it?
- Caitlin's store.

17:15.881 --> 17:18.880
Well, she found it actually,
but she asked me to return it.

17:18.881 --> 17:19.881
Oh.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.880
Yes, I think I was in there.

17:23.881 --> 17:25.400
Are you sure?

17:25.401 --> 17:28.880
The thief could have used
the hot cash to buy something.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.881
Is that what Caitlin said?

17:29.882 --> 17:32.880
No, she said you'd
definitely been in the store, but...

17:32.881 --> 17:35.400
Well, it's disappointing, really.

17:35.401 --> 17:37.880
Not for you, obviously.

17:37.881 --> 17:39.880
Although it doesn't
explain the fish.

17:39.881 --> 17:41.560
What fish?

17:41.561 --> 17:45.880
I can't tell you about the fish,
it's an ongoing investigation.

17:45.881 --> 17:46.881
Oh.

17:46.882 --> 17:49.880
Maybe I just left
the door open myself.

17:49.881 --> 17:51.400
Yes.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.560
You're getting very forgetful, Ruth.

17:53.561 --> 17:55.880
Yes.

17:55.881 --> 17:57.063
I think I am.

17:57.881 --> 18:00.240
Wow. It's a lovely house.
This is great.

18:00.241 --> 18:03.880
Maybe we should have all our
tutorial groups here.

18:03.881 --> 18:06.880
Well, we've got tea and coffee,
biscuits.

18:06.881 --> 18:08.920
Oh, are they gluten free?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.880
Er, no, I don't think so.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.880
Oh. Never mind.

18:12.881 --> 18:14.881
- Sam?
- Sure, why not?

18:16.561 --> 18:17.880
Right.

18:17.881 --> 18:19.880
Let's, er, get things kicked off,
then, shall we?

18:19.881 --> 18:22.880
- Would you like a biscuit?
- Oh!

18:22.881 --> 18:24.880
- Oh, no, no.
- Basal body temperature?

18:24.881 --> 18:28.400
No, no, that's not
part of the presentation.

18:28.401 --> 18:29.880
Louisa, shall we...?

18:29.881 --> 18:32.880
Erm, well, shouldn't we...?
Shouldn't we wait for Tony?

18:32.881 --> 18:36.080
You might be waiting a while.
He'll be running on Tony time.

18:36.081 --> 18:39.880
Yes, Mr Chegga,
I imagine it is pretty painful.

18:39.881 --> 18:42.880
OK, yeah. Just be a minute...

18:42.881 --> 18:45.880
- Oh, I'm just here for the...
- Look, take a seat.

18:45.881 --> 18:46.881
Yes. No, but as I said,

18:46.882 --> 18:50.880
you need to explain your symptoms
to the doctor,

18:50.881 --> 18:53.880
and not to me. OK, Scott?

18:53.881 --> 18:56.880
I, erm, only have
a set amount of time,

18:56.881 --> 18:58.920
so maybe we should get started.

18:58.921 --> 19:00.880
Erm...

19:00.881 --> 19:02.240
What... I'll film it.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.880
- Post it on the WhatsApp group later.
- Great.

19:04.881 --> 19:08.720
- Really?
- Thanks. Go ahead, Louisa.

19:08.721 --> 19:10.560
Yeah, all right.

19:10.561 --> 19:11.881
Erm, OK.

19:15.881 --> 19:17.880
Erm, OK.

19:17.881 --> 19:23.880
My presentation today is
on how pressure to achieve

19:23.881 --> 19:26.560
fuels anxiety in teenagers.

19:26.561 --> 19:30.240
Studies have shown that
a sizeable majority of teenagers

19:30.241 --> 19:33.880
correlate success in education,
with success in later life...

19:33.881 --> 19:36.720
Your dog's eating the snacks.

19:36.721 --> 19:39.240
Buddy, no, in your basket.

19:39.241 --> 19:40.880
In your basket.

19:40.881 --> 19:42.920
Obviously got the little guy
well trained.

19:42.921 --> 19:46.880
I'm actually allergic to dogs,
y'know, so is it...?

19:46.881 --> 19:49.880
Oh, do you want me to put him out?

19:49.881 --> 19:51.880
Louisa, that would be lovely,
is that...? Is that...?

19:51.881 --> 19:52.881
Yeah, well, if that's what you need.

19:52.882 --> 19:57.428
Come on, Buddy,
you have to go out, I'm afraid. No.

20:01.561 --> 20:02.880
Come through.

20:02.881 --> 20:04.880
Um. OK.

20:04.881 --> 20:06.880
Sorry, is this, er...

20:06.881 --> 20:10.880
- Oh, I think maybe
I'm not supposed to be... - Door!

20:10.881 --> 20:12.241
Oh, bugger.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.700
- You're struggling.
- I'm fine.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.880
You have striae.

20:20.881 --> 20:22.880
- I have what now?
- Stretch marks.

20:22.881 --> 20:25.880
- How long have you had those?
- Um, a few months.

20:25.881 --> 20:27.560
Yes, you're overweight.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.880
I am planning
to start exercising again.

20:29.881 --> 20:32.880
- Do you bruise easily?
- Yeah. A little.

20:32.881 --> 20:34.880
Um.

20:34.881 --> 20:36.880
This is a doctor's
consultation room, isn't it?

20:36.881 --> 20:39.880
Have a seat. Roll up your sleeve.
I'm gonna take your blood pressure.

20:39.881 --> 20:42.880
Why? Do you think there's
something wrong with me?

20:42.881 --> 20:45.080
Shh! Sleeve.

20:45.081 --> 20:47.880
So now we turn to Case Study A.

20:47.881 --> 20:50.880
Would you pass that round, please?

20:50.881 --> 20:51.920
The promising musician

20:51.921 --> 20:54.880
who had continually
excelled at her studies,

20:54.881 --> 20:56.880
up to the age of 17.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.240
She's left to isolate herself.

20:59.241 --> 21:02.880
She began to develop
symptoms of OCD,

21:02.881 --> 21:05.880
she suffered from panic attacks.

21:05.881 --> 21:09.880
- Oh!
- Which, erm, impacted on her studies,

21:09.881 --> 21:12.880
which in turn caused her
greater stress

21:12.881 --> 21:17.880
and eventually she was unable
to take her exams, due to stress.

21:17.881 --> 21:19.880
- What about her parents?
- Sorry, we're not...

21:19.881 --> 21:22.880
We're not quite at the
question-and-answer phase yet.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.880
Well, it just feels like
you're placing the blame

21:24.881 --> 21:25.881
squarely on the student,

21:25.882 --> 21:28.880
when maybe it was her parents
who were on her case all the time.

21:28.881 --> 21:30.880
No, I did say she was
in a high-pressured environment.

21:30.881 --> 21:33.880
Not allowed to have any friends,
social life, anything.

21:33.881 --> 21:35.720
It's just a case study...

21:35.721 --> 21:37.880
Audrey, maybe it's best
to let Louisa finish first.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.920
- Save the questions for later.
- Yeah, thanks, Sam.

21:40.921 --> 21:43.920
So, erm, Case Study A, then...

21:43.921 --> 21:46.880
...high flying student
who broke under pressure...

21:46.881 --> 21:49.245
I, erm... I need a minute.

21:50.881 --> 21:54.880
Right, OK. So as I was saying,
the thing with Case Study A...

21:54.881 --> 21:57.880
- I should, erm, go and check on her.
- Sure.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.972
She's had a tough time. Erm, yeah.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.880
Has anybody heard from Tony?

22:03.881 --> 22:05.881
Nope.

22:07.881 --> 22:09.880
Hmm.

22:09.881 --> 22:12.880
Your blood pressure's high.
Are you taking steroids?

22:12.881 --> 22:14.880
No. Aren't they illegal?

22:14.881 --> 22:16.880
No. Do you eat a lot of fatty foods?

22:16.881 --> 22:18.880
Not really. I'm vegan.

22:18.881 --> 22:20.880
When you were picking up
those books earlier,

22:20.881 --> 22:22.560
you seemed to be struggling.

22:22.561 --> 22:24.880
Do you get fatigue
in your arms and legs?

22:24.881 --> 22:27.920
Well, yes. I haven't been feeling
that well lately.

22:27.921 --> 22:29.880
- Sorry, Mr, uh...?
- Dr Ellingham.

22:29.881 --> 22:33.560
I... I don't really understand
what's going on here.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.880
What is it
you think's wrong with me?

22:35.881 --> 22:38.560
Based on your proximal myopathy,
your weight

22:38.561 --> 22:39.880
and the redness of your cheeks,

22:39.881 --> 22:42.880
- I suspect that you have
Cushing's disease. - What?

22:42.881 --> 22:44.240
It's a condition caused

22:44.241 --> 22:46.880
by the adrenal glands
producing too much cortisol,

22:46.881 --> 22:50.880
which controls blood sugar
and regulates your metabolism.

22:50.881 --> 22:51.881
Is it serious?

22:51.882 --> 22:55.882
Hmm, yes, if left untreated,
it can be fatal.

22:56.881 --> 22:57.881
Oh, my God.

22:59.881 --> 23:01.880
I need to sit down.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.880
You are sitting down.

23:03.881 --> 23:06.880
I'll take a blood sample.
And if your cortisol is high,

23:06.881 --> 23:08.720
then I'll refer you
to an endocrinologist,

23:08.721 --> 23:10.720
who will measure
your hormone levels.

23:10.721 --> 23:12.880
They'll also scan your adrenal
and pituitary glands,

23:12.881 --> 23:14.720
to see which one has the tumour

23:14.721 --> 23:17.880
and whether or not
it's benign or malignant.

23:17.881 --> 23:19.880
Did you just say tumour?!

23:19.881 --> 23:21.880
And anxiety.

23:21.881 --> 23:24.880
But anxiety medication
should be prescribed with caution

23:24.881 --> 23:28.720
and only after
a proper medical consultation,

23:28.721 --> 23:32.880
because you can become dependent
on them... quite quickly and easily.

23:32.881 --> 23:34.080
So, in our next section,

23:34.081 --> 23:37.880
we'll be looking at the wider range
of remedies and treatments.

23:37.881 --> 23:39.880
And that's it.

23:39.881 --> 23:41.240
Er, go on.

23:41.241 --> 23:44.514
I can't.
Cos the next section's Tony.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.880
- Oh. - Actually, if you want,
I'm fairly sure I could do

23:47.881 --> 23:48.881
his part of the presentation...

23:48.882 --> 23:50.880
No, no, no. No. No.
No, you stay here.

23:50.881 --> 23:54.880
I'll just... I'll just go
and check if he's outside.

23:54.881 --> 23:57.400
I don't have your patient notes.

23:57.401 --> 24:00.401
- Do you have them with you?
- No.

24:02.881 --> 24:05.880
Morwenna, have you got...?
What's your name?

24:05.881 --> 24:06.920
- Tony Williams.
- Have you got his notes?

24:06.921 --> 24:09.880
There aren't any. I don't think
he's one of your patients, Doc.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.880
- What? Who are you?
- Well, I...

24:11.881 --> 24:13.880
Tony, what are you doing?
We've been waiting for you.

24:13.881 --> 24:16.240
Well, I was trying to find
the tutorial group and then...

24:16.241 --> 24:17.880
Well, this guy told me
to go in there

24:17.881 --> 24:19.880
and it all just
happened so quickly...

24:19.881 --> 24:21.880
I'll write you
a referral for your own GP.

24:21.881 --> 24:23.880
All right, Ton,
where you been, mate?

24:23.881 --> 24:24.881
Here he is, skiver!

24:24.882 --> 24:26.880
We've still got time to do
the presentation if you'd like.

24:26.881 --> 24:28.880
Tony, what happened? Are you ready?

24:28.881 --> 24:31.880
Sorry, I don't think I'm in the
right frame of mind right now.

24:31.881 --> 24:34.063
Mate, are you all right?

24:34.881 --> 24:37.880
- I'm dying.
- What?!

24:37.881 --> 24:40.880
He's not dying. Louisa, do you think
you could encourage your study group

24:40.881 --> 24:42.880
to stay out of the surgery area,
please.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.880
I need to go.
I need to see my doctor.

24:44.881 --> 24:46.080
- Well, hang on...
- All right, mate.

24:46.081 --> 24:48.880
But... But what about
the presentation?

24:48.881 --> 24:51.880
I wouldn't worry. You'll pass.
Everyone knows Sam loves you.

24:51.881 --> 24:53.920
I'm so sorry.
Perhaps we should reschedule?

24:53.921 --> 24:55.880
- We'll, erm, talk about it next week.
- OK.

24:55.881 --> 24:57.880
Martin, would you be free to see me?

24:57.881 --> 24:59.720
- You've got an appointment.
- No.

24:59.721 --> 25:01.400
No, it's not a question,
it's a statement.

25:01.401 --> 25:03.880
You've got an appointment,
it's not for 15 minutes,

25:03.881 --> 25:07.063
but I'll see you now, come through.

25:07.921 --> 25:09.880
How did it go?

25:09.881 --> 25:12.427
It, uh... It was a disaster.

25:16.881 --> 25:19.880
Oh, your bone density seems normal.

25:19.881 --> 25:24.154
- No signs of osteoporosis.
- Well, that's good.

25:24.881 --> 25:26.881
Put your shoe back on.

25:28.721 --> 25:30.880
Ruth, I've noticed, that, er,

25:30.881 --> 25:32.880
recently you've been
becoming quite forgetful.

25:32.881 --> 25:34.881
Yes. I have.

25:35.881 --> 25:39.880
It's become fairly obvious to me
that I wasn't burgled.

25:39.881 --> 25:43.880
I mislaid my purse
and left my own door open.

25:43.881 --> 25:46.880
You said you were feeling unwell.

25:46.881 --> 25:50.880
Erm, headaches, tiredness,
slight dizziness.

25:50.881 --> 25:53.880
I'm probably
coming down with something.

25:53.881 --> 25:56.972
Hmm. You don't have a temperature.

25:59.881 --> 26:03.080
I think we both know
what the problem might be.

26:03.081 --> 26:08.081
No, we both know that
it's a possibility and that's all.

26:10.721 --> 26:12.720
I can't think of anything worse.

26:12.721 --> 26:14.400
Ruth, you're a doctor.

26:14.401 --> 26:16.880
We both know the hazards
of leaping to conclusions,

26:16.881 --> 26:19.700
without solid medical evidence.

26:19.881 --> 26:21.880
The truth is...

26:21.881 --> 26:27.972
I've been forgetting how to do the
most simple everyday tasks and...

26:31.881 --> 26:34.080
Well, no, you're right.

26:34.081 --> 26:36.991
Speculating doesn't do any good.

26:37.881 --> 26:41.880
Why don't I give you
a Mini-Mental State Exam?

26:41.881 --> 26:43.880
You are showing some early symptoms.

26:43.881 --> 26:46.880
The exam will help us determine
what to do next.

26:46.881 --> 26:48.881
Hmm?

26:58.190 --> 27:00.189
Right, I'm going to spell
a word forwards,

27:00.190 --> 27:02.189
and I want you to
spell that word backwards.

27:02.190 --> 27:06.189
The word is WORLD.
W-O-R-L-D.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.918
Please, spell that in reverse.

27:09.190 --> 27:10.190
D...

27:10.191 --> 27:11.229
R...

27:11.230 --> 27:13.190
L-O-W.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.229
And, finally, in any order,

27:18.230 --> 27:22.189
please list the three objects
I mentioned earlier.

27:22.190 --> 27:26.189
Er, a football...

27:26.190 --> 27:27.190
apple...

27:29.190 --> 27:32.190
...I can't remember the last one.

27:36.190 --> 27:39.554
Don't sugar coat any bad news,
Martin.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.189
Your score here would suggest

27:43.190 --> 27:46.189
that there's a possibility
you may have some form of dementia.

27:46.190 --> 27:48.189
But let's refer you
to a clinical psychologist

27:48.190 --> 27:50.189
for more a sophisticated profile

27:50.190 --> 27:53.281
and a neuropsychiatrist
for a scan.

28:01.190 --> 28:03.189
I've still got a few minutes
before my next patient,

28:03.190 --> 28:05.189
if there's anything
you'd like discuss?

28:05.190 --> 28:07.189
No, thank you.

28:07.190 --> 28:08.827
I'll be on my way.

28:15.190 --> 28:16.645
Oh, hello, Ruth.

28:21.190 --> 28:23.189
Last patient, Doc. Paula Kemp.

28:23.190 --> 28:24.554
Er. Go through.

28:27.190 --> 28:29.189
Uh, how you getting on
with your revision?

28:29.190 --> 28:30.190
All right, I think.

28:30.191 --> 28:33.189
Well, if you stay behind after
surgery tomorrow, I'll test you.

28:33.190 --> 28:36.029
Well, it's Friday tomorrow.
It's basically the weekend.

28:36.030 --> 28:38.189
You asked me to help you
and I'm offering to help you.

28:38.190 --> 28:40.372
After surgery, tomorrow.

28:44.190 --> 28:47.189
- What can I do for you?
- I've had a reaction.

28:47.190 --> 28:49.389
- A reaction?
- To the implant.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.189
Since you put it in,
I've felt really ill.

28:51.190 --> 28:54.189
- I had a terrible night last night.
- Well, the dosage was correct.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.869
It can't be anything to do
with the implant.

28:55.870 --> 28:58.052
I'll have a look at you.

29:00.190 --> 29:02.281
What are your symptoms?

29:03.190 --> 29:05.189
My muscles ache all over

29:05.190 --> 29:08.189
and I've been
having these hot flushes.

29:08.190 --> 29:10.372
Came on around midnight.

29:11.190 --> 29:14.189
Yes, you've got a temperature,
which would suggest a virus.

29:14.190 --> 29:16.189
You might be
fighting off an infection.

29:16.190 --> 29:20.645
I'll take a blood sample,
that should reveal more.

29:42.190 --> 29:44.189
I came to see if you were all right.

29:44.190 --> 29:48.918
I didn't think that tea and sympathy
were your style.

29:49.190 --> 29:50.230
Come in.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.189
I don't drink whisky.

29:57.190 --> 29:58.190
I know.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.229
You know that test
is far from definitive.

30:04.230 --> 30:07.189
There are many forms
of cognitive disorder.

30:07.190 --> 30:10.189
Oh, you are making me feel better.

30:10.190 --> 30:14.918
There's no good form
of mental deterioration, Martin.

30:15.190 --> 30:20.189
Nevertheless, it's good to think
about coping strategies,

30:20.190 --> 30:22.189
of which,
drinking alcohol is not one.

30:22.190 --> 30:24.100
I don't want to cope.

30:26.030 --> 30:29.189
I was going to write another book
this winter.

30:29.190 --> 30:31.189
What was it going to be about?

30:31.190 --> 30:33.189
A confirmation that social factors

30:33.190 --> 30:35.189
don't play as prominent a role
in crime

30:35.190 --> 30:39.189
when compared to psychological
and medical conditions,

30:39.190 --> 30:42.189
with particular reference
to childhood.

30:42.190 --> 30:43.190
Sounds a bit derivative.

30:43.191 --> 30:46.189
- Oh, thank you, Martin.
- No, I meant, there's already

30:46.190 --> 30:48.229
a number of publications
on that subject.

30:48.230 --> 30:50.321
None that are any good.

30:52.030 --> 30:54.189
Well, you might want to write it
sooner rather than later...

30:54.190 --> 30:56.189
Oh?

30:56.190 --> 30:59.189
So, it's possible I might finish it
before I lose my marbles.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.645
No, I'm just saying that...

31:04.710 --> 31:06.983
Maybe we do it all wrong.

31:08.030 --> 31:10.189
You know there are societies,

31:10.190 --> 31:13.189
where the elderly
just walk out into the woods

31:13.190 --> 31:17.189
when they think their time has come,
never to be seen again.

31:17.190 --> 31:18.869
Do they?

31:18.870 --> 31:20.234
What societies?

31:22.190 --> 31:23.190
I forget.

31:31.190 --> 31:38.189
♪ Happy birthday to you

31:38.190 --> 31:43.189
♪ Happy birthday, dear Daddy

31:43.190 --> 31:46.189
♪ Happy birthday to...

31:46.190 --> 31:48.189
♪ Daddy. ♪

31:48.190 --> 31:50.189
Thank you.

31:50.190 --> 31:51.827
Blow it out, then.

31:52.390 --> 31:54.549
Clever Daddy.

31:54.550 --> 31:57.189
Gotta make a wish now.

31:57.190 --> 31:59.189
Yes, well.

31:59.190 --> 32:02.189
James made you a card at nursery,
didn't you?

32:02.190 --> 32:03.549
Let's have a look.

32:03.550 --> 32:06.189
We think it's a giraffe,
or maybe a duck.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.869
- Happy birthday, Doc.
- Oh, hello, Joe.

32:08.870 --> 32:12.189
- Make yourself at home.
No need to knock. - Thanks.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.229
Got you this.

32:14.230 --> 32:17.869
- It's a card.
- Oh, thank you.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.190
Open it, then.

32:24.190 --> 32:27.189
It's a play on words, see,
the surgeon's saying,

32:27.190 --> 32:29.549
"Nurse, I told you
to remove his spectacles!"

32:29.550 --> 32:33.189
because she's removed, you know...

32:33.190 --> 32:35.189
What's the matter with you?

32:35.190 --> 32:37.029
It's just a joke.

32:37.030 --> 32:39.189
You seem to be experiencing
some discomfort.

32:39.190 --> 32:42.189
Oh, it's a migraine,
been coming on for days.

32:42.190 --> 32:44.189
You had migraines before?

32:44.190 --> 32:47.189
It's been a while,
a few years, actually.

32:47.190 --> 32:51.189
Have you done any strenuous exercise
lately or changed your diet?

32:51.190 --> 32:53.189
Just came to give you a card, Doc.

32:53.190 --> 32:55.189
But, no, I have not.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.189
When did you start feeling ill?

32:57.190 --> 32:59.189
A few days ago, probably.

32:59.190 --> 33:02.189
Since I investigated
the "break-in" at Ruth's.

33:02.190 --> 33:05.549
Really, how long
did you spend much at Ruth's?

33:05.550 --> 33:09.189
A bit. That day. The day after.

33:09.190 --> 33:12.189
I have a headache, too.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.389
I'm... sorry for you?

33:14.390 --> 33:17.189
Take two of these.
I have to pop out for a while.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.372
- OK.
- Well done, James.

33:22.190 --> 33:24.029
Ruth!

33:24.030 --> 33:25.189
Ruth...

33:25.190 --> 33:27.190
Ruth!

33:28.190 --> 33:31.189
- Martin.
- Have you got a gas cooker?

33:31.190 --> 33:32.709
- What?
- A gas cooker.

33:32.710 --> 33:35.189
You've woken me up
to ask if I have a cooker?!

33:35.190 --> 33:38.189
- Yes.
- Martin, I'm going back to bed.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.029
No!

33:40.030 --> 33:41.189
Happy birthday, Doc.

33:41.190 --> 33:44.189
It's your 60th, isn't it?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.100
Yes, thank you... No.

33:48.190 --> 33:51.189
Ruth!

33:51.190 --> 33:54.189
Ru-uth!

33:54.190 --> 33:56.189
What's the matter with you?!

33:56.190 --> 33:59.189
I thought I was the one who was
supposed to be losing my mind.

33:59.190 --> 34:00.190
Have you got a gas cooker?

34:00.191 --> 34:03.189
No, electric. Got a gas boiler.

34:03.190 --> 34:05.869
- Right, come out here.
- I'm in my dressing gown.

34:05.870 --> 34:10.188
Come out of there, come here.
And give me your hand.

34:10.190 --> 34:13.389
Are you going to
explain any of this?

34:13.389 --> 34:15.228
Everyone who's
visited your house recently,

34:15.230 --> 34:18.188
has had a headache.
Including me.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.188
It can't be just hearing
about your new book.

34:21.190 --> 34:24.188
Now, there. You've got severe
carbon monoxide poisoning.

34:24.190 --> 34:26.188
You could be dead.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.188
You mean I've got a gas leak?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.869
Well, it would explain the loss
of memory and your confusion.

34:30.870 --> 34:35.324
It's a better explanation
than senility, isn't it?

34:35.550 --> 34:37.190
Oh, God.

34:40.190 --> 34:43.869
Of course, we can't
rule senility out.

34:50.089 --> 34:53.888
Yeah. The carbon monoxide detector
says your boiler is leaking.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.888
You won't be able to stay here
until it's fixed.

34:55.889 --> 34:57.888
I'll need to find a hotel, then.

34:57.889 --> 34:58.889
Oh, stay in one of our rooms!

34:58.890 --> 35:00.888
Happy to give you a discount.

35:00.889 --> 35:02.888
And even happier
to give you it for free.

35:02.889 --> 35:04.888
- Of course,
that's always another option. - Yes.

35:04.889 --> 35:06.888
- Well, if it's no bother...
- No, of course not.

35:06.889 --> 35:08.888
We'll get your bags,
while you lock up.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.888
Right, boy.
Onwards and upwards.

35:10.889 --> 35:12.888
Thank you, both.

35:27.889 --> 35:29.889
Paula? Are you there?

35:34.729 --> 35:35.911
Anyone there?

35:41.729 --> 35:43.729
Paula!

35:48.889 --> 35:50.888
- Happy birthday, Doc.
- Tosser!

35:50.889 --> 35:51.889
Out the way!

35:51.890 --> 35:55.568
- Happy Birthday, tosser.
- Honestly, why?

35:55.569 --> 35:57.928
- Oh, God!
- Martin, she's coming round.

35:57.929 --> 36:01.888
What's that smell?
It's like mackerel.

36:01.889 --> 36:05.526
Er, Mrs Flint, er, Kent,
can you hear me?

36:07.889 --> 36:09.888
Oh, what's that?

36:09.889 --> 36:11.617
What happened here?

36:12.889 --> 36:14.888
Oh, my God! What bit you?

36:14.889 --> 36:16.888
It's become seriously infected.

36:16.889 --> 36:19.088
- Mrs King.
- She... She didn't mean it...

36:19.089 --> 36:22.888
- I'll call an ambulance.
- I already have.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.889
I'll have to get that cleaned up.

36:43.089 --> 36:47.569
Martin, I need you to come
and see something.

36:56.889 --> 36:58.888
There's a seal in the bath.

36:58.889 --> 37:00.888
Oh, thank goodness.

37:00.889 --> 37:03.980
I thought I must be hallucinating.

37:10.889 --> 37:12.728
Did that seal bite you?

37:12.729 --> 37:14.888
- She was just playing.
- Ruth, can you phone Penhale,

37:14.889 --> 37:16.888
see if he can come
and get rid of this animal.

37:16.889 --> 37:19.888
The chances are
you've got cellulitis.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.888
It was only a nip.
I put some antiseptic on it.

37:21.889 --> 37:24.728
That won't be enough.
Seals are filthy animals.

37:24.729 --> 37:26.888
They carry all kinds of
bacteria in their saliva.

37:26.889 --> 37:28.888
I was trying to protect her.

37:28.889 --> 37:30.568
I'll give you a strong antibiotic

37:30.569 --> 37:32.408
to help you
protect against the infection.

37:32.409 --> 37:35.682
- Penhale's on his way.
- Hold still.

37:39.889 --> 37:42.248
I can confirm
there is a seal in the bath.

37:42.249 --> 37:43.888
We knew that.

37:43.889 --> 37:44.889
Hang about.

37:44.890 --> 37:47.888
Are you the one that's been
stealing Stuart Bryne's fish?

37:47.889 --> 37:51.888
I was giving her baby formula,
but it was just so expensive.

37:51.889 --> 37:54.728
I was going to pay him
for the fish eventually,

37:54.729 --> 37:55.888
once I'd released
her back into the sea,

37:55.889 --> 37:57.888
but she got so heavy.

37:57.889 --> 38:00.088
Why didn't you just take her
to Penwith Seal Sanctuary?

38:00.089 --> 38:01.888
They said they were full up

38:01.889 --> 38:04.888
and would have had to find
an alternative solution for her.

38:04.889 --> 38:07.888
- You know what that means, don't you?
- Too many seals.

38:07.889 --> 38:09.408
They'd turn her into cat food.

38:09.409 --> 38:12.888
Take it to the RSPCA,
they'll know what to do with it.

38:12.889 --> 38:13.889
That's two hours away.

38:13.890 --> 38:16.248
I'll miss Al and Morwenna's
engagement party.

38:16.249 --> 38:17.888
Yeah.

38:17.889 --> 38:19.888
Wear gloves. They bite.

38:19.889 --> 38:21.253
Right, come on.

38:22.729 --> 38:25.888
It was just nice,
having someone who relied on me.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.888
Well, you have a dog.
You know how that feels.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.888
No, I don't. It's not my dog.

38:30.889 --> 38:34.888
It's OK.

38:34.889 --> 38:36.888
Steady.

38:36.889 --> 38:39.249
That's it, it's OK.

38:44.889 --> 38:45.889
You arrive at a scene

38:45.890 --> 38:47.888
and the patient's
lying on the floor.

38:47.889 --> 38:51.888
And you ask him or her if they're
all right and you get no reply.

38:51.889 --> 38:54.888
- What do you do next?
- Erm, check the airway is clear.

38:54.889 --> 38:57.888
Can you hold your arm like that,
please?

38:57.889 --> 38:59.888
A patient is choking
on a piece of food.

38:59.889 --> 39:02.248
He can't breathe, he can't talk
and he can't cough it up.

39:02.249 --> 39:03.888
What do you do to help?

39:03.889 --> 39:05.888
Five back blows
between his shoulder blades.

39:05.889 --> 39:07.888
- Ah, that's very good.
- That's Mel on her way over.

39:07.889 --> 39:09.889
Oh. Are you going out?

39:10.889 --> 39:12.729
No.

39:13.889 --> 39:15.888
Well, why have you got
a babysitter, then?

39:15.889 --> 39:17.248
Because...

39:17.249 --> 39:19.888
- We're going for a walk.
- That.

39:19.889 --> 39:21.888
Your evening sounds
about as exciting as mine.

39:21.889 --> 39:23.928
Helping out at the pub, again!

39:23.929 --> 39:28.475
- Right, see you Monday.
- Morwenna, wait a minute.

39:48.409 --> 39:50.409
All right, you can go.

39:59.889 --> 40:02.888
Will you be quiet?
I'm not gonna tell you again.

40:02.889 --> 40:04.889
Blooming seals.

40:13.569 --> 40:14.888
Room to your liking?

40:14.889 --> 40:16.928
Yes, very nice, thank you.

40:16.929 --> 40:20.888
I'll have a large whisky,
in both senses of the word.

40:20.889 --> 40:24.248
- Right.
- All right, All right, OK.

40:24.249 --> 40:25.888
All right, everyone.

40:25.889 --> 40:29.088
Everyone, listen, she's at home,
she's getting changed,

40:29.089 --> 40:31.888
she's gonna be here in five.
So, I want everyone to keep it down.

40:31.889 --> 40:35.888
When she walks in, I want you
all to shout, "Surprise!"

40:35.889 --> 40:38.888
And then I'll do my speech,
and I'll propose,

40:38.889 --> 40:41.888
and then it's all beers and cheers
and the rest of it.

40:41.889 --> 40:43.888
OK? OK.

40:43.889 --> 40:46.408
Ah, Doc,
thanks for delaying Morwenna.

40:46.409 --> 40:49.888
- Oh, mm-hm, you're welcome.
- Would you like a drink?

40:49.889 --> 40:51.888
No, just a glass of water for me.
Louisa?

40:51.889 --> 40:54.888
- Hmm, glass of white wine please.
- Really?

40:54.889 --> 40:56.248
Due to phenolic compounds,

40:56.249 --> 40:58.888
white wine contains antioxidants
which are effective

40:58.889 --> 41:01.888
in moderation for a healthy heart
and artery function.

41:01.889 --> 41:02.889
Have you learnt that off by heart?

41:02.890 --> 41:04.889
No. Of course not.

41:05.889 --> 41:08.526
Oh, thank you, Al. Thank you.

41:09.889 --> 41:11.888
Please.

41:11.889 --> 41:13.888
Please... Be quiet, please.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.888
- Thank you.
- Shh!

41:15.889 --> 41:17.888
Now, I know we're all here

41:17.889 --> 41:20.888
to celebrate
Al and Morwenna's engagement,

41:20.889 --> 41:24.888
but I couldn't pass up this
opportunity of saying a few words

41:24.889 --> 41:26.928
about the person
who I'm sure is uppermost

41:26.929 --> 41:28.888
in all of our thoughts today.

41:28.889 --> 41:32.888
I am referring, of course,
to Portwenn's resident GP,

41:32.889 --> 41:35.889
Dr Martin Ellingham.

41:36.889 --> 41:38.888
Oh, no, I know, I know.

41:38.889 --> 41:43.888
His time here has not been
without its ups and... its downs.

41:43.889 --> 41:48.888
There is his blood phobia, yes,
and the terrible uncertainty

41:48.889 --> 41:52.888
of the General Medical Council,
which, well...

41:52.889 --> 41:55.888
As many of you will know,

41:55.889 --> 41:58.888
today is
Dr Ellingham's birthday.

41:58.889 --> 42:00.568
Oh, God.

42:00.569 --> 42:03.888
And, as a token of
the village's thanks, excuse me,

42:03.889 --> 42:06.888
and my own chemist team...

42:06.889 --> 42:10.568
I have baked him...

42:10.569 --> 42:14.888
...a very special cake.

42:14.889 --> 42:18.888
♪ Ha-ppy birthday to you... ♪

42:18.889 --> 42:20.888

for the Doc?

42:31.889 --> 42:33.888
- Why didn't anyone tell me?
- No, this is for you.

42:33.889 --> 42:35.888

42:41.889 --> 42:44.253
Be quiet! Please, Mrs Til.

42:45.889 --> 42:48.344
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.888
Um...

42:52.889 --> 42:54.888
Morwenna Newcross,

42:54.889 --> 42:59.888
will you do me the honour
of being my bride?

42:59.889 --> 43:01.888
I already said yes, you idiot.

43:01.889 --> 43:04.888
I know, but will you say yes again?

43:04.889 --> 43:05.889
OK.

43:07.889 --> 43:09.071
There you go.

43:21.889 --> 43:24.888
There was a time when you wouldn't
have come to an event like this.

43:24.889 --> 43:26.888
Actually,
I'd quiet like to leave now.

43:26.889 --> 43:28.888
- So you're only doing this for me?
- Yes.

43:28.889 --> 43:31.888
- I'd actually like to leave, as well.
- Well, come on, let's go.

43:31.889 --> 43:34.568
Oh, Martin! Martin... I mean, Doc.

43:34.569 --> 43:36.888
You haven't had
a slice of your cake yet.

43:36.889 --> 43:40.071
- I don't eat cake. Thank you.
- Oh.

43:46.889 --> 43:47.889
Oh!

43:47.890 --> 43:49.889
Martin!

43:51.889 --> 43:52.889
Awkward.

43:58.569 --> 44:01.888
You're home early... Oh.
What's happened?

44:01.889 --> 44:03.928
- Did you hit him?
- Joe Penhale.

44:03.929 --> 44:05.888
Can't say I'm surprised.

44:05.889 --> 44:08.248
It was gonna happen sooner or later.

44:08.249 --> 44:09.888
You are very rude to that poor man.

44:09.889 --> 44:11.888
No, no, he didn't hit, Martin.

44:11.889 --> 44:14.253
It was... It was the door.

44:14.409 --> 44:16.088
Oh, course it was.

44:16.089 --> 44:18.888
Well, James is sleeping,
good as gold, upstairs.

44:18.889 --> 44:20.888
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

44:20.889 --> 44:22.928
Aw, thanks, Mel.

44:22.929 --> 44:25.888
You're gonna have a shiner there,
Doc.

44:25.889 --> 44:26.889
Good night.

44:32.729 --> 44:33.888
Are you sure you're OK?

44:33.889 --> 44:36.888
Erm, well, I have no dizziness.

44:36.889 --> 44:38.888
No ringing in the ears,
no nausea either.

44:38.889 --> 44:42.888
I don't think I'm concussed,
just a bit sore.

44:42.889 --> 44:46.409
Now, I know you told me not to,
but...

44:49.889 --> 44:52.253
...I bought you a present.

44:58.889 --> 45:00.888
It's a...
It's a Japanese Deba knife.

45:00.889 --> 45:04.526
- It's for filleting fish.
- Yes, I know.

45:04.889 --> 45:06.409
Thank you.

45:08.889 --> 45:10.799
It's very thoughtful.

45:12.889 --> 45:16.162
I hope it wasn't too bad a birthday.

45:18.889 --> 45:21.568
Sorry.

45:21.569 --> 45:24.728
It's all right.

45:24.729 --> 45:25.889
Thank you.

45:34.889 --> 45:36.888
Surgery's closed this morning.

45:36.889 --> 45:37.928
GMC assessment.

45:37.929 --> 45:40.888
- Oh, it's a complete farce.
- Oh, that's the spirit.

45:40.889 --> 45:42.728
I think you should leave, lady.

45:42.729 --> 45:44.888
Yes, please leave.

45:44.889 --> 45:47.888
How may I be of assistance?

45:47.889 --> 45:49.888
Best chance would be
the day after tomorrow.

45:49.889 --> 45:50.889
Book me in, then.

45:50.890 --> 45:54.981
You don't need an appointment.
You're my wife.
