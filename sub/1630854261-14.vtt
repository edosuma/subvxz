Athletic Conference finals,

00:33.992 --> 00:35.618
your Cinderella
season continues.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.120
How does it feel?

00:37.162 --> 00:39.664
Honestly, amazing,
like a long time coming.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.416
Everyone says
you're the reason

00:41.458 --> 00:42.625
this team is here.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.960
What do you
say to that?

00:44.002 --> 00:45.920
I think
that this team

00:45.962 --> 00:47.630
is the reason why
this team is here.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.299
We all have the same
drive to win.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.717
But you're
the MLB prospect

00:50.759 --> 00:52.135
who chose
to play here.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.386
All eyes
are on you.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.763
Do you feel
any pressure?

00:54.804 --> 00:56.264
Yeah, of course,

00:56.306 --> 00:58.475
but not because
I'm an MLB prospect.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.518
Like, we win together.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.353
You recently
lost your father.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.189
You said in an interview
that he taught you

01:04.230 --> 01:05.690
about
handling pressure.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.693
Any specific lesson
come to mind?

01:11.571 --> 01:13.531
Um...

01:13.573 --> 01:16.242
to accept
that the pressure

01:16.284 --> 01:18.495
will always be there,

01:18.536 --> 01:21.289
embrace it
when it comes,

01:21.331 --> 01:23.958
and to be strong enough
to weather it alone.

have come a long way.

Well, that's one way
to say you're proud.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.477
Hey, don't get too cocky.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.978
Still one more day left
until the pinning ceremony.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.147
Hey, I can't
even wait.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.524
I'm gonna be strolling
at every party till
my feet fall off.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.359
Hey, you and me both.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.652
Yeah. How about y'all
stroll y'all asses

01:50.693 --> 01:52.028
around here
and clean up?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.947
Hey, man, enjoy your
little power trip

01:53.988 --> 01:56.199
because once we cross
and we're equals,

01:56.241 --> 01:57.784
you ain't gonna be
talking to us like that.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.494
J.R.: Oh? Spoiler alert--
Cam: Hmm.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.830
as your prophyte,
trash talking never ends.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.957
Aw, man! That's cool.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.792
OK, so no mini golf.

No.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.338

No, absolutely not.

"Tell our girl

02:15.510 --> 02:16.970
indecision
isn't a good look."

02:17.011 --> 02:18.638
Well, why don't
you tell Keisha

02:18.680 --> 02:20.765
to stop acting out this
Dr. Pace revenge fantasy

02:20.807 --> 02:22.851
in New York and get
her butt back here?

02:22.892 --> 02:24.394
If she
was gonna find

02:24.435 --> 02:25.895
a former student
to snitch on Dr. Pace,

02:25.937 --> 02:27.647
wouldn't she have
found them by now?

I think that ship
has sailed, much
like my patience.

an activity?

Lando: How about
hanging with us?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.865
So you
told them, too?

02:36.906 --> 02:38.700
Yeah. I'm tired
of you obsessing over

02:38.741 --> 02:40.827
what dumbasses are
saying on the Internet.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.203
We all know that
that cop stop

02:42.245 --> 02:43.705
was straight-up
racial profiling,

02:43.746 --> 02:45.415
and you got to ignore
the trolls.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.708
Yeah. Well,
that's kind of hard

02:46.749 --> 02:48.585
when the trolls are
the only ones talking.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.170
We've been ghosted
by the police

02:50.211 --> 02:51.671
and the Georgia
Athletic Conference.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.131
I thought
Dr. Patterson's statement

02:53.173 --> 02:54.591
would get
some movement.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.134
Well, it's
not enough.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.927
It's been,
what, a week,

02:57.969 --> 02:59.387
and everyone's
just acting like

02:59.429 --> 03:00.930
this bus stop
didn't even happen,

and we're still not
in the conference.

-So you didn't know about this?

Uh, she said she was
uncertain about her future

03:28.374 --> 03:31.502
and considering it,
but nothing was a sealed deal.

of every young man

we did,

to say thank you

that held a rally to
protest police brutality.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.037

being investigated

but fired.

of higher learning,

a week before
the election.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.894
It's tradition.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.271
Simone: OK.

09:23.312 --> 09:24.855
Um, if you need
to do the interview--

09:24.897 --> 09:27.567
No, ma'am.
I'm exactly
where I need to be

09:27.608 --> 09:30.152
because if my friends
need my support,
I show up for them.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.946
That's my tradition.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.489
So you're just
gonna let Nico be

09:33.531 --> 09:35.032
the only candidate
in the paper.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.450
No. No, no, no.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.077
That would be you
because you're

09:38.119 --> 09:40.121
refusing to reschedule,
but you have

09:40.162 --> 09:42.748
my contact information
if you change your mind.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.376
That's all.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.461
Come on, girl.

09:47.503 --> 09:51.048
Nate, your campaign
is important.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.967
Maybe you should just
do the interview now.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.677
You can't let up.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.804
I'm not.
I'm prioritizing.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.640
He'll get it together.
Watch.

10:02.268 --> 10:06.355
Y'all, these signs
are giving.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.399
This idea is giving.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.234
Simone, it feels good
to be doing something.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.986
Super dope that
everybody is here

10:12.028 --> 10:13.529
supporting us, too.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.365
Thea: You can count me
as one of them.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.284
Jade: Thea, don't even
try to walk up in here

10:18.326 --> 10:20.328
like you
didn't just ghost us.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.122
Look, I handled
going pro wrong.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.416
I should've told
you guys myself,

10:25.458 --> 10:28.169
and I should've
been there on
that bus with you.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.879
I could've helped.

10:29.920 --> 10:34.425
No. You couldn't.
That's the worst part.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.052
No one could help us.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.678
And you weren't there,
so if you're trying

10:37.720 --> 10:39.930
to get rid of
your guilt or whatever,

10:39.972 --> 10:42.099
do it somewhere else.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.976
Nate: Thea, I think maybe
this isn't the right time.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.312
No. I got it.
You--I'll just--

10:46.354 --> 10:48.397
I'll leave
you guys to it.

10:51.525 --> 10:54.278
Nathaniel:
Did you honestly expect
that to go any other way?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.988
I guess not--I don't know--

10:56.030 --> 10:57.573
but there must
be some way

10:57.615 --> 10:59.283
for me to make it
up to them,

10:59.325 --> 11:00.826
just let them know
I actually care.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.703
There are
plenty of ways

11:02.745 --> 11:04.664
for you to
show up for people,

11:04.705 --> 11:08.459
but if I were you,
I would aim
for maximum impact.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.845
Yo.

11:19.887 --> 11:20.304
So, what, you
and your Little Leaguers

11:20.346 --> 11:21.972
ready to play
with the big dogs?

11:22.014 --> 11:23.474
Ah, you
with the jokes,

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
and here I was
coming over to wish

11:25.059 --> 11:26.811
you and your backup
dancers good luck.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.938
"Backup dancers"?
The best you can do?

11:28.979 --> 11:30.940
Says the MLB prospect
who put his team
on the map

11:30.981 --> 11:32.566
and pretty much
led them

11:32.608 --> 11:34.276
all the way to
the conference finals?

11:34.318 --> 11:36.362
-So we back on this?
-No, not at all.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.614
I'm good with being
the underdog

11:38.656 --> 11:39.865
because that's
a lot of expectation

11:39.907 --> 11:41.325
for somebody
to carry.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.536
I wouldn't wish
that heat on nobody,

11:43.577 --> 11:47.164
not even you.

This is me chill.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.589
You let some old heads
from our Psi chapter

11:55.631 --> 11:56.841
come up in here and
snatch our pledges?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.092
What the hell
we supposed to do?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.343
You know those bruhs
are no joke.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
They always take
things too far.

12:01.011 --> 12:01.971
Remember what they did
to us when we were on line?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.556
I do remember.

12:03.597 --> 12:04.974
It wasn't cool then, and
it ain't cool now, man.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.225
You were supposed
to stop them.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.269
I wasn't even here.
Julian was.

12:08.310 --> 12:12.189
Julian. You tell dude
I'm looking for him.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.358
I'm gonna ask you
one more damn time.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.193
Lou's asleep
in the game room.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.825
Hey, bro, I've
been going crazy

12:22.867 --> 12:24.577
trying to
find you, man.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.454
You been
to the hospital?

12:26.495 --> 12:28.247
Nah. It's just
a dislocated shoulder.
I'm good.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.874
No. You need
to see a doctor,

12:29.915 --> 12:31.333
and I'm not leaving
until you say you OK.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.753
All right,
but, Big Brother, sir,

12:33.794 --> 12:35.337
know that
I ain't snitching.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.757
I know this is what
it take to be a KEK.

12:37.798 --> 12:41.260
Cam: Yeah. Look,
I got him, man,

12:41.302 --> 12:45.097
but, um, what
you gonna do about this?

12:45.139 --> 12:46.932
I don't know.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.142
Can't think
right now, Cam.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.643
I got
a game to play.

12:49.685 --> 12:51.187
OK. Cool. Well,
play your little game,

12:51.228 --> 12:53.773
but hear me on this, J.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.775
If you don't
handle these fools,

12:55.816 --> 12:58.360
the moment I cross,
I'm finding them

12:58.402 --> 13:00.321
and I'm beating
their asses.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.994
[Ringtone]

13:07.036 --> 13:09.205
[Clears throat]

13:11.415 --> 13:13.042
Don't you have
a game to play?

13:13.083 --> 13:14.627
Lando, on phone: Yeah.
I do, but it seems

13:14.668 --> 13:16.504
all anyone can talk
about is your rally.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.508
Yeah. They're allowing me
to promote it at the game.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.885
Damon's mom
hooked me up.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.386
Your voice
just trailed.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.138
No, it didn't.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.224
Yeah, it did.
What's up?

13:28.265 --> 13:32.394
If this rally doesn't
push the needle
toward justice,

13:32.436 --> 13:36.357
it'll devastate
the team.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.818
Simone, come on.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.946
You can't think
about that right now,
all right?

13:41.987 --> 13:43.781
There's a reason
your team's

13:43.823 --> 13:45.366
following
your lead.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.325
You were born
for this.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.577
Just focus
on what's right.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.329
You want to know
what else?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.872
What's that?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.375
Starting
the championship game,

13:54.416 --> 13:56.085
you were built
for that.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.004
It's freaky when
you read my mind.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.631
[Laughs]

14:00.673 --> 14:03.509
Finish warming up.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.553
Yeah, and get down here
to the field already,

14:05.594 --> 14:07.221
all right?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.658
Marcus.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.954
for your big
game-day speech?

14:31.996 --> 14:34.498
I've had that locked
and loaded for weeks.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.126
You don't seem nervous.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.378
I woke up this morning
thinking how far we've come,

14:39.420 --> 14:41.881
how far I've come,

14:41.922 --> 14:43.674
and just like that,
the nerves were gone.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.802
Wow. Well, there goes
my big pep talk.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.220
[Both laugh]

14:48.262 --> 14:49.763
I, um--

14:49.805 --> 14:52.433
I do have
something for you.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.351
What you got?

14:55.686 --> 14:58.814
Wow. Wow.
My championship ring.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.691
Guess I'd always hoped

15:00.733 --> 15:03.319
we'd find our way
back to each other.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.531
Now go win
another one.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.121
Yo, J.R., where
the hell are you, bro?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.081
The game's
about to start.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.917
Look,
hit me back, man.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.462
Marcus: Damon,
where the hell is J.R.?

15:21.503 --> 15:23.756
Uh...

15:23.797 --> 15:24.965
[Exhales]

15:25.007 --> 15:26.759
Look, Coach,

15:26.800 --> 15:28.302
don't make me choose
between lying to you

15:28.344 --> 15:29.553
and snitching on
my brother, all right?

15:29.595 --> 15:30.846
OK. Well,
stay out of it, then.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.307
Yes, sir.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.643
[Sighs]

15:38.145 --> 15:40.105
Look, Damon...

15:41.231 --> 15:42.733
there's been
a lot of talk

15:42.775 --> 15:44.401
about you carrying
this win on your back, man.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.987
[Exhales]

15:47.029 --> 15:49.198
Come on, Coach.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.033
Hey, don't make me
choose between

15:51.075 --> 15:54.036
lying to you
and snitching
on myself now.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.330
Well, I'mma need you
to drop that dime.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.332
Look,
I ain't gonna lie.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.459
The pressure's
been getting to me.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.670
I know that it shouldn't,
Coach, but, like--

16:02.711 --> 16:05.673
When a lot of people put
the pressure on you, son,

16:05.714 --> 16:07.299
OK, the only thing you
can do to overcome this

16:07.341 --> 16:11.345
is remember
who you are, all right?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.640
-That's it?
-For now.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.308
I don't got
a lot to do

16:16.350 --> 16:18.477
because you're
gonna bring us home.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.979
You're gonna get that team
out to the field.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.480
Why don't you
hype up your boys?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.148
You want me
to give the speech?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.275
You've seen me
give enough of them.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.570
Just speak
from the heart, Damon.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.407
Yo, after the game,
you and me

16:31.448 --> 16:33.117
gonna have
a conversation, J.R.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.244
-You heard me?
-I hear you, Coach.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.663
All right, now.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.582
All right, fellas.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.251
Let's bring it in.
Let's bring it in.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.384
Look,

16:50.426 --> 16:53.971
we done came a long way
in this last year.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.640
And, you know, we had a lot of
people that counted us out,

16:56.682 --> 16:58.684
and what did we do
every single time?

16:58.726 --> 17:02.062
We stepped up,
and we delivered,

17:02.104 --> 17:04.732
and today ain't gonna be
no exception.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.234
When I first
came to this school,

17:07.276 --> 17:09.153
I thought that I had to put
the team on my shoulders

17:09.194 --> 17:11.071
for us to win.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.907
That was cap, real talk,

17:13.949 --> 17:15.951
because I've been
standing on yours.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.495
We done came so far,
and we defied every odd

17:18.537 --> 17:21.040
because that is who we are.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.042
And when we go out there
on that field,

17:23.083 --> 17:25.878
we can't forget that,
all right?

17:25.919 --> 17:28.547
No matter what
anyone says,

17:28.589 --> 17:30.507
we are part of a whole,

17:30.549 --> 17:33.427
and no one can do anything
on their own,

17:33.469 --> 17:36.263
especially win,

17:36.305 --> 17:38.265
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do today.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.850
-Y'all hear me?
-Yeah.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.185
-Y'all hear me?
-Yeah.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.770
-Y'all hear me?
-Yeah!

17:42.811 --> 17:44.146
-B. what?
-B.U.!

17:44.188 --> 17:45.314
-B. what?
-B.U.!

17:45.355 --> 17:46.315
-B. what?
-B.U.!

17:46.356 --> 17:47.316
