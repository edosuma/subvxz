WEBVTT

00:01.608 --> 00:03.399
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.768
- What you working on?
- I'm taking over

00:05.869 --> 00:07.570
this advice column while
the writer's on vacation.

00:07.671 --> 00:10.272
- Oh, cool!
- Yeah. This... this reader wants

00:10.374 --> 00:13.109
to know if he should quit
his job to pursue his dream

00:13.210 --> 00:15.945
- of stand-up comedy.
- Yeah, that's a no, right?

00:16.046 --> 00:18.047
Yeah, I wrote, "No." That's it so far.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.281
- That's all I have.
- I think that's all you need.

00:19.383 --> 00:21.717
- I think that's enough. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:21.818 --> 00:24.387
Just push him off that path. Man, this
sounds like a really good gig for you.

00:24.488 --> 00:26.222
- Thanks. Yeah.
- No, I'm serious.

00:26.323 --> 00:29.291
I mean, you give good advice,
and you're a good writer,

00:29.393 --> 00:32.427
and you're thoughtful and smart.
Plus, also nice and generous.

00:32.529 --> 00:34.597
- OK, what's this about?
- Well...

00:34.698 --> 00:37.266
the carnival is in town,

00:37.367 --> 00:39.201
and I sort of don't have
money at the moment,

00:39.302 --> 00:41.575
and Dad and Ruth are
still in Summerside.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.439
- There it is.
- So I was hoping

00:43.540 --> 00:46.175
that you could give me some money

00:46.276 --> 00:48.177
to go to that, please.

00:49.582 --> 00:50.746
- No.
- Please, man.

00:50.847 --> 00:54.116
Please! It's so good this year.
They got a freak show tent.

00:54.217 --> 00:56.952
Andy, some of these freaks
are out of this world.

00:57.053 --> 00:59.188
They got the tallest boy
in the Maritimes under 12.

00:59.289 --> 01:02.691
They have the world's oldest
Red Hot Chili Peppers fan.

01:02.793 --> 01:06.195
I'm not lending you any money. What happened
to all those gigs that you used to do?

01:06.296 --> 01:07.663
I don't know, my sources dried up,

01:07.764 --> 01:09.999
and I blew the last of my
savings on my Rude Guy t-shirts.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.101
- Have I shown you those?
- No.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.903
I'm actually wearing one
right now if you want to have

01:14.004 --> 01:16.906
a gander. There you go.
Haha! There he is.

01:17.007 --> 01:20.276
- I'll sell you this one if you want it. 30 bucks. 40? 50?
- No.

01:20.377 --> 01:22.144
- No, you keep going up.
- $60.

01:22.245 --> 01:24.513
- Mark, you need a job.
- Hmm!

01:24.614 --> 01:27.983
You need to get a real job. That way,
you can use the money that you make to do

01:28.084 --> 01:30.553
- the things you like.
- Andy, I wouldn't know how to get a job even if I wanted one.

01:30.654 --> 01:34.156
Now, that is something
I can help you with.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.561
- What the hell is this little self-satisfied display?
- Trying to help you.

01:38.662 --> 01:41.063
That's awful. Never do that face again.

01:41.164 --> 01:43.999
(theme song)

01:46.991 --> 01:48.637
Well, we are hiring.

01:49.319 --> 01:51.740
Are you both applying for the job?

01:51.842 --> 01:54.410
No, I'm just here for support.
It's Mark's first interview,

01:54.511 --> 01:56.278
and I just want to make
sure he doesn't blow it.

01:56.379 --> 01:58.347
He's not wrong to worry about that.
In many ways,

01:58.448 --> 02:00.950
I do not want this job,
but in other ways,

02:01.051 --> 02:03.152
the money, I do want it.

02:03.253 --> 02:06.489
Oh, wow, that is
a refreshingly honest answer.

02:07.103 --> 02:08.491
OK, let's look at this resume.

02:08.592 --> 02:11.093
- You've used a very large font.
- Yeah.

02:11.194 --> 02:14.396
Yes. Yeah, yeah, that's just
to emphasize his strengths.

02:14.498 --> 02:16.765
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And also,

02:16.867 --> 02:18.901
just to be completely honest,

02:19.002 --> 02:21.437
it is not that much stuff on there.

02:21.538 --> 02:23.672
The bigger font just kind of
makes it look like more stuff.

02:23.773 --> 02:26.375
Yeah. Another very honest answer.

02:26.476 --> 02:28.344
Thank you so much.
Hey, if you like honesty,

02:28.445 --> 02:30.279
Mayor Breeley, I can honestly...
(small chuckle)

02:30.380 --> 02:32.348
...just lay it all
out for you right now,

02:32.449 --> 02:34.049
- put my cards on the table.
- Oh! OK.

02:34.150 --> 02:37.019
I'm a lazy guy,
and he gets mad about it,

02:37.120 --> 02:39.154
- but not a lot he can do.
- I do. I do.

02:39.256 --> 02:42.324
I also will show up late.
It's mostly a power move

02:42.425 --> 02:44.793
that I kind of put out there
if I'm ever feeling small,

02:44.895 --> 02:47.062
and I want to assert my dominance.
You know,

02:47.163 --> 02:48.898
see what they do about it.
Fire me if you want, you know.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.900
I don't give a s...! Pay me first.

02:51.001 --> 02:52.801
- OK...
- Oh, he also has

02:52.903 --> 02:55.671
- his CPR certificate.
- Yeah, but that stands

02:55.772 --> 02:57.606
for Cool Prankster Rascal.

02:57.707 --> 02:59.575
You said that was for first aid.

02:59.676 --> 03:02.945
Yeah, 'cause I was pranking
you like a cool rascal.

03:04.137 --> 03:05.891
I cannot believe she
offered you that job.

03:05.926 --> 03:08.984
Yeah, well, I'm a charismatic guy,
Andy. I told you I win people over.

03:09.085 --> 03:10.886
Anyway, it doesn't matter,
I'm not taking the job.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.222
- What? Why?
- Because I wouldn't get paid

03:13.323 --> 03:15.658
until Friday, and by that time,
the carnival would already be gone.

03:15.759 --> 03:18.060
OK, alright. Well, we'll apply
for a job at a bar, get some tips.

03:18.161 --> 03:21.430
- I'm done playing around, man. I just wanna go to the carnival.
- Yeah, but if you go

03:21.531 --> 03:24.466
- to the carnival, you won't have any money.
- I will figure it out, Andy.

03:24.568 --> 03:26.535
I always do.
I'm a sneaky guy, I'm resourceful.

03:26.636 --> 03:29.405
A problem solver. Trust me,
when I put my mind to things, I...

03:30.846 --> 03:32.674
Oh, man, I can't get this tie off.
How do I get this tie off?

03:32.756 --> 03:34.176
- Just pull it.
- For real though, I can't.

03:34.277 --> 03:36.712
- Let me try it.
- I'm making it way tighter, and it hurts me very badly.

03:36.813 --> 03:38.647
It's making me choke,
and I can't breathe.

03:38.748 --> 03:40.716
- (repeating): It's OK.
- Thank you. Jesus!

03:40.817 --> 03:44.486
Ugh! No, you hold it, I hate it.
See you later.

03:44.588 --> 03:46.488
- (kids screaming)
- (carnival music)

03:46.590 --> 03:49.625
(man): Do you wanna go faster?

03:50.340 --> 03:53.262
OK, Mark, show time.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.130
Excuse me, Ma'am,
do you have any tickets

03:55.231 --> 03:57.132
you could spare?
Any tickets at all? Some money?

03:57.233 --> 03:58.968
It's not for me. It's for my
kid who's really sick. He wants

03:59.069 --> 04:00.736
- to ride the Himalaya. No?
- Sorry.

04:00.837 --> 04:02.341
Do you have any tickets
or money you could spare?

04:02.406 --> 04:05.137
- Sorry, man, I only carry a day pass.
- Right. Got you.

04:05.172 --> 04:07.414
Oh, Bryn! Bryn, Bryn, Bryn, Bryn! Stop!

04:07.726 --> 04:10.279
- Can I borrow some money?
- No, I already spent it all on my pass.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.515
- I'm gonna see the furry twins.
- What's the furry twins?

04:13.617 --> 04:15.517
Two twins completely covered in fur.

04:15.619 --> 04:18.428
Right. So like part of the
freak show or something?

04:18.463 --> 04:20.488
No, Mark, they run the tilt-awhirl.

04:20.589 --> 04:23.926
They're not freaks, they're perfect.
They're perfect.

04:30.903 --> 04:33.369
We're almost there.
Just a little calibration and...

04:33.470 --> 04:35.371
- Hey, Dr. Green.
- Oh, hey.

04:35.472 --> 04:37.128
You don't have a couple
bucks I could borrow, do you?

04:37.141 --> 04:39.375
I'm sorry, Mark,
I've already spent $200 here.

04:39.476 --> 04:43.412
- $200? Where's all your prizes?
- You know, I didn't win a one,

04:43.513 --> 04:45.547
but I can't seem to stop.

04:45.649 --> 04:48.083
You know, I think
I may have a gambling problem.

04:48.184 --> 04:50.085
I did not know that about myself.

04:50.186 --> 04:53.188
Right. Well, are you putting
back spin on your throws?

04:53.987 --> 04:55.190
- Do you want to take a shot?
- Are you serious?

04:55.291 --> 04:58.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell you what,
give me a cut of your prizes.

04:58.161 --> 05:00.029
- OK.
- For real.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.665
Yes, that's... that's fine, yes.

05:03.924 --> 05:06.001
Aaah... alright.

05:07.054 --> 05:09.732
AAAH! AAAH, look at this guy!

05:09.767 --> 05:11.040
- I know him, I know him.
- Told ya.

05:11.141 --> 05:13.575
- ♪
- (people cheering)

05:13.677 --> 05:16.578
Ooh, yeah! Oh,

05:16.680 --> 05:19.114
- Dr. Green?
- Ha ha ha ha!

05:19.215 --> 05:22.384
Alright. Kid, do your thing.

05:22.485 --> 05:24.553
- (blowing air)
- My man.

05:24.654 --> 05:27.089
Come on now. Papa needs a new...

05:27.190 --> 05:30.125
potato guy.

05:31.895 --> 05:33.862
(people cheering)

05:33.963 --> 05:37.103
I peeked a little.
I peeked a little. OK.

05:37.363 --> 05:39.134
There you go, pal.
Why don't you go give that

05:39.235 --> 05:41.870
to a sexual partner of your
preference at school, OK?

05:41.971 --> 05:43.972
No judgment. Under 18.

05:45.018 --> 05:46.742
- Hey, man.
- Someone wants a word.

05:46.843 --> 05:50.212
Yes, alright, cool. Dr. Green, if I don't
come back, call the police, please.

05:50.313 --> 05:52.347
(muffled carnival music)

05:54.117 --> 05:57.419
Thank you, Jethro. Please, take a seat.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.490
(ominous music)

06:01.591 --> 06:03.926
- My name is Marni.
- Hi.

06:04.027 --> 06:07.229
- That's Jethro.
- Hi, Jethro.

06:07.330 --> 06:10.065
- This is Evangeline.
- (with Quebecer accent): You're very good at,

06:10.166 --> 06:12.167
how you say... the ball toss?

06:12.268 --> 06:15.304
You have won many potato men.

06:16.622 --> 06:18.440
Well, I mostly gave 'em away.

06:18.541 --> 06:20.175
I just like to play.

06:20.276 --> 06:23.912
Cut this crap!
Your playing is our profit.

06:24.013 --> 06:27.149
Easy, Evangeline.
Just put the knife away.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.752
She's really into knives right now.
It's a whole thing.

06:30.779 --> 06:32.621
- Right.
- So...

06:33.857 --> 06:37.392
- ...how long you been a carny?
- Oh, I'm not a carny.

06:37.494 --> 06:40.062
I'm a... I guess, a carnival enthusiast.

06:40.163 --> 06:42.097
Well, that makes things
kind of difficult for us.

06:42.198 --> 06:45.300
We let you run around here all weekend,
we're not gonna have any prizes

06:45.401 --> 06:47.202
- left when we hit the next town.
- Right.

06:47.303 --> 06:49.538
Well, you really don't
have to worry about that.

06:49.639 --> 06:51.673
I don't even have any money, so...

06:51.775 --> 06:53.776
Yeah? How would you like some?

06:53.877 --> 06:56.145
I would like some very much.
Yes, please.

06:56.246 --> 06:58.213
- Any amount.
- Alright.

06:58.314 --> 07:00.282
I'm prepared to offer you a job.

07:00.383 --> 07:02.317
- Are you serious?
- Hm.

07:02.418 --> 07:04.520
You want to give me a job?
You don't wanna see my resume

07:04.621 --> 07:06.655
or anything like that? 'Cause it's bad.

07:06.756 --> 07:10.192
As long as you haven't been
convicted of any major crimes...

07:10.733 --> 07:12.628
Sweet! Sorry, um,

07:12.729 --> 07:14.863
- how major are we talking about?
- Major.

07:15.940 --> 07:18.300
Then, I am almost certainly clean.

07:18.401 --> 07:21.170
Great. Evangeline will show you around.

07:21.271 --> 07:23.605
Thank you so much! Thought I was gonna

07:23.706 --> 07:26.594
get killed when I came in here;
this is way better.

07:29.155 --> 07:31.857
Hey, step right up! Step right up!

07:31.958 --> 07:35.427
Five bucks gets you three balls!
Six bucks gets you three balls

07:35.528 --> 07:38.564
plus I get a dollar.
Oh-oh! Good deal for me.

07:39.282 --> 07:40.699
Hiya, Mark. Great job earlier.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.634
Look, you gotta spot me
a couple of throws.

07:42.736 --> 07:44.536
Dr. Green, I told you.
There's no freebies, man.

07:44.637 --> 07:46.772
- Mark, it's... it's me.
- We don't have

07:46.873 --> 07:49.108
- that close a relationship.
- OK, OK, OK. I mean,

07:49.209 --> 07:51.398
- what if I gave you this watch?
- No, I'm not taking your watch.

07:51.478 --> 07:54.012
- That's a really nice watch, man.
- Yes, it's a nice watch.

07:54.114 --> 07:56.148
My father was a watchmaker.
It's the first he ever made.

07:56.249 --> 07:58.550
He told me never to pawn it.
I can pawn it.

07:58.651 --> 08:00.419
Don't pawn it. Don't...

08:00.520 --> 08:03.322
- don't pawn your dad's watch.
- Mark!

08:03.423 --> 08:05.557
Well, uh... Bryn told me
you're working here.

08:05.658 --> 08:07.726
- What the hell, man?
- One second, I'll be right with you.

08:07.827 --> 08:09.928
Peanut, going on break, pal.

08:10.665 --> 08:12.331
Let's go!

08:12.432 --> 08:14.633
Hey, what do you guys think of my getup?
Pretty cool, right?

08:14.734 --> 08:16.602
Yeah, it's great.
Mark, you know I can get you

08:16.703 --> 08:18.837
- a better job, right?
- What?! Are you kidding me?

08:18.938 --> 08:21.840
This place is perfect, Andy.
I get free rides,

08:21.941 --> 08:24.676
free prizes and... more money
than I know what to do with.

08:24.778 --> 08:27.112
Check it out,
I got a potato man phone case!

08:27.213 --> 08:29.615
- Wow, that's awesome!
- Yeah, and it's so heavy.

08:29.716 --> 08:33.085
Yeah, that's great, Mark.
It's just... Isn't this place, like,

08:33.186 --> 08:35.921
- filled with weirdos?
- Andy! No!

08:36.022 --> 08:38.157
That is such an old misconception.

08:38.258 --> 08:41.293
These people are some of the
greatest folks I've ever met!

08:41.394 --> 08:44.797
Peanut back there has
died five different times.

08:44.898 --> 08:48.133
And he says each time,
he brought something back.

08:48.234 --> 08:50.435
Isn't that wild? That's Beth over there.

08:50.537 --> 08:52.938
She is the world's oldest
Red Hot Chili Peppers' fan.

08:53.039 --> 08:54.873
Hey, Beth! Beth!

08:54.974 --> 08:57.676
- Beth, how old are you?
- 85!

08:57.777 --> 08:59.211
What are you listening to right now?

08:59.312 --> 09:01.547
- What do you think?
- Hell yeah, girl!

09:01.648 --> 09:04.016
Hell yeah! Ooh! And that's Evangeline.

09:04.117 --> 09:06.819
Come on, I want to introduce you guys.
Let's go.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.389
- (carnival music playing)
- Here we are. Evangeline,

09:10.490 --> 09:12.191
threatened me with a
knife when we first met,

09:12.292 --> 09:14.159
but we are cool now.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.829
Hello, handsome. Who are your friends?

09:16.930 --> 09:19.531
Oh, this is my brother Andy,
and this is Bryn,

09:19.632 --> 09:21.834
the niece of a woman who may
or may not be dating our dad.

09:21.935 --> 09:23.402
- Hello.
- I like your necklace.

09:23.503 --> 09:26.772
Is that a lock of hair in that vial?

09:26.873 --> 09:29.241
It's fur.
One of the furry twins gave it to me.

09:29.342 --> 09:31.844
- I don't know which one.
- Those twins,

09:31.945 --> 09:35.380
they're such charmers.
Like this one there, huh?

09:35.481 --> 09:38.917
With his sweet face and
his undernourished body.

09:39.018 --> 09:41.220
- He's such a sweet one!
- Well, the tone

09:41.321 --> 09:43.188
says compliment,
so that's how I'm gonna take it.

09:43.289 --> 09:45.958
One moment.

09:46.059 --> 09:47.993
If I catch you cheating again,

09:48.094 --> 09:50.095
I will cut off your hand.

09:50.196 --> 09:51.897
Cool! Right,
we're gonna get going, Evangeline,

09:51.998 --> 09:53.966
but nice seeing you.

09:59.577 --> 10:00.839
You know what, Bryn?

10:00.940 --> 10:03.475
Yesterday, Mark was unmotivated
and borderline unemployable.

10:04.257 --> 10:05.477
I don't like to pat myself
on the back usually...

10:05.578 --> 10:07.512
You've still got vomit on your
shirt from the teacup ride.

10:07.614 --> 10:09.514
Yeah, those things spin way too fast.

10:09.616 --> 10:11.884
(phone ringing)

10:14.621 --> 10:16.855
- Yello?
- Oh, hello, Andy.

10:16.956 --> 10:20.125
- And how's my favourite son?
- Oh! I'm good, Dad.

10:20.226 --> 10:22.561
Oh, sorry, sorry. I was actually asking

10:22.662 --> 10:24.763
- about Mark.
- Rollie...

10:24.864 --> 10:27.399
- He's just kidding, Andy.
- I can't even see him,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.768
and I can tell how angry he is.
Hey, Andy, Ruth and me

10:29.869 --> 10:32.304
are staying another night in Summerside.

10:32.405 --> 10:35.073
The yard sales out here are outrageous.

10:35.174 --> 10:37.743
- Tell him about the skulls.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:37.844 --> 10:39.645
We bought 50 human skulls.

10:39.746 --> 10:42.381
Somebody was just selling
'em out in his yard.

10:42.482 --> 10:44.750
Wait. What guy has 50 human skulls?

10:44.851 --> 10:47.252
Who cares?
Somebody offers you 50 human skulls

10:47.353 --> 10:49.288
at a fair price,
you don't ask questions.

10:49.389 --> 10:51.089
- Yes, you do!
- So anyway,

10:51.190 --> 10:53.458
where is Mark? 'Cause I want
to tell him about this gift

10:53.559 --> 10:55.394
- I've got him: a skull.
- Mark got a job.

10:55.495 --> 10:58.363
- He's working at the carnival.
- Oh, that's nice!

10:58.464 --> 11:01.533
He's a carny! Or is there another term

11:01.634 --> 11:03.802
that they prefer to that?
Maybe a person of carnival?

11:03.903 --> 11:07.172
Andy, what the hell is Mark
doing working at a carnival?

11:07.273 --> 11:10.342
He wanted to go, but he didn't have any
money, so I convinced him to get a job.

11:10.443 --> 11:12.423
Why didn't you just give him the money?!

11:12.512 --> 11:15.132
Because he needs to learn
responsibility, Dad.

11:15.215 --> 11:18.283
Andy, let me explain something to you.

11:18.384 --> 11:20.986
Carnivals are dangerous places,

11:21.087 --> 11:24.790
and Mark is a sweet, naive boy.
They will eat him alive!

11:24.891 --> 11:27.693
Mark is a 30-year-old man;
I think he can take care of himself.

11:27.794 --> 11:29.828
- Oh, is that what you think?
- Yes!

11:29.929 --> 11:33.298
I mean, I'm starting to lose confidence,
but overall yes!

11:33.399 --> 11:36.168
Oh, that's great.
Well, as long as you're happy with that.

11:36.269 --> 11:38.737
I am! I am not going
to baby Mark anymore,

11:38.838 --> 11:40.872
and you know what? Neither should you.

11:40.974 --> 11:42.874
(hanging up phone)

11:42.976 --> 11:45.143
So then I said, "I don't care

11:45.244 --> 11:47.412
"how much you cry about it,
if you don't got the tickets,

11:47.513 --> 11:51.016
- you don't get to ride, baby."
- (all laughing)

11:51.857 --> 11:53.118
You did not say that.

11:53.219 --> 11:55.554
I did. I said it right
to his 6-year-old face.

11:55.655 --> 11:57.222
And he felt it. He felt it.

11:57.323 --> 11:59.224
- Haha!
- Yeah, you were born

11:59.325 --> 12:01.660
for this work, man.
Just like the rest of us here.

12:01.761 --> 12:03.962
I'm just sorry I didn't
figure that out earlier.

12:04.063 --> 12:05.314
Many of us came to it late in life.

12:05.332 --> 12:07.666
I used to be a camera operator on films.

12:07.767 --> 12:10.168
Ah, cool! Anything I might have seen?

12:10.746 --> 12:13.772
Are you familiar with the Ken Burns'
<i>Civil War</i> documentary?

12:13.807 --> 12:15.474
Yeah. What? You worked on that?

12:15.575 --> 12:18.143
No, I worked
on a pornographic parody of it.

12:18.244 --> 12:19.911
That was 50 hours, right,

12:20.013 --> 12:23.315
with some of the largest battle
scenes in pornographic history.

12:23.416 --> 12:26.318
- Battle scenes? Wow, OK.
- Oh, but it wasn't expensive.

12:26.419 --> 12:28.153
Like, 'cause we just
used like photographs,

12:28.254 --> 12:29.988
moving screen left,
screen right and top to bottom.

12:30.089 --> 12:31.723
- OK.
- Critics said

12:31.824 --> 12:34.192
our faithfulness to the form

12:34.293 --> 12:36.228
ruined any hint of eroticism.

12:36.329 --> 12:39.398
Sure, OK. Wow, that's amazing!

12:39.499 --> 12:41.433
- Thank you.
- You know. Yeah.

12:41.534 --> 12:43.702
Did you all have jobs before this too?

12:43.803 --> 12:45.337
Played in the CFL.

12:45.438 --> 12:49.341
- (rock song in the background)
- CFL... CFL...

12:49.442 --> 12:51.443
I won MVP seven times.

12:52.843 --> 12:54.513
Right. No, I'm just trying to...

12:54.614 --> 12:56.748
My face is the first thing
you see when you enter

12:56.849 --> 12:58.683
the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

12:58.785 --> 13:00.519
Football! There it is. There it is.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.587
I always forget that Canada
has a football league,

13:02.688 --> 13:05.824
but cool! Good for you!

13:05.925 --> 13:08.360
OK, I'm gonna get another drink.

13:08.461 --> 13:11.196
Anyone else want something?

13:11.297 --> 13:13.432
You're good? OK. Be right back, guys.

13:13.533 --> 13:14.583
(indistinct chatter)

13:14.584 --> 13:17.874
_

13:18.264 --> 13:20.599
_

13:21.007 --> 13:23.675
_

13:24.012 --> 13:25.541
_

13:25.737 --> 13:27.705
_

13:27.871 --> 13:29.106
_

13:29.215 --> 13:31.850
Soon, you will be
joining us on the road.

13:31.951 --> 13:35.554
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
How far are we gonna travel anyway?

13:35.655 --> 13:37.989
Some carnivals cover the Maritimes,

13:38.091 --> 13:40.025
some the country,

13:40.126 --> 13:43.395
but our carnival covers the Maritimes.

13:43.496 --> 13:45.497
Oh, OK, yeah.

13:45.598 --> 13:47.999
Not really where I thought
that was going, but right on.

13:48.101 --> 13:50.001
You want to see what our
living quarters look like?

13:51.237 --> 13:53.805
- Sure, yeah.
- Come on.

13:53.906 --> 13:55.774
Oh, jeez! OK.

13:58.778 --> 14:02.614
- Would you like a drink?
- Oh, uh, yeah, sure.

14:02.715 --> 14:05.383
It's a nice place.

14:06.090 --> 14:07.385
Oh, OK...

14:07.487 --> 14:09.421
Just two different liquors that
were sitting out, that's fun.

14:09.990 --> 14:12.324
Oh, it smells so old.
I'll put that there.

14:12.425 --> 14:14.593
I never told you what
I used to do for a living.

14:14.694 --> 14:17.596
- Oh no, you didn't, no.
- I worked with the homeless.

14:17.697 --> 14:20.532
- Oh, wow! That's really nice.
- I taught them how to fight

14:20.633 --> 14:23.602
for a series of online videos
called <i>Homeless Battles.</i>

14:24.401 --> 14:25.604
Right, OK, that is...

14:25.705 --> 14:27.606
that is less nice than I thought it was.

14:28.362 --> 14:30.308
- Very much so.
- OK.

14:30.409 --> 14:32.644
This is moving so, so fast. Um.

14:32.745 --> 14:34.946
It's just like sort of
starting to dawn on me

14:35.047 --> 14:37.582
that we don't know
each other too well...

14:37.683 --> 14:39.684
- You are so sweet, huh?
- Oh...

14:39.785 --> 14:41.686
So much nicer than my husband.

14:42.478 --> 14:45.223
Yeah. Yeah, I could have sworn
you said "husband" there.

14:45.324 --> 14:46.825
Oh, don't worry, we are separated.

14:46.926 --> 14:48.994
I've made it very clear
I care nothing for him

14:49.095 --> 14:51.229
or his precious Canadian football.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.698
Your husband is Jethro?
OK, I'm gonna go.

14:53.799 --> 14:55.834
- I'm gonna leave this place. No.
- I knew you were no good!

14:55.935 --> 14:58.303
- OK.
- One day in the carnival and you're already

14:58.404 --> 15:00.906
- angling for my girl!
- Nothing happened, Jethro.

15:01.007 --> 15:03.141
I am not your girl! We are separated!

15:03.242 --> 15:05.977
And you are having sex with
strangers all the time!

15:06.078 --> 15:07.679
I did that once

15:07.780 --> 15:09.681
because <i>you</i> wanted to
open up our relationship,

15:09.782 --> 15:12.884
- and I cried the whole time.
- Because you are weak!

15:12.985 --> 15:15.734
- Oh, wow!
<i>- Oh, bravo!</i>

15:15.769 --> 15:17.088
Where did you learn to catch like that?

15:17.190 --> 15:19.124
- The stupid CFL?
- It's not stupid.

15:19.225 --> 15:21.860
It's much harder than the NFL.
We only get three downs

15:21.961 --> 15:24.196
instead of four,
and our field is ten yards longer.

15:24.297 --> 15:26.665
- Ten yards!
- Spare me your defense

15:26.766 --> 15:29.201
of that ridiculous league, OK?
Eight teams <i>total;</i>

15:29.302 --> 15:31.536
- 2 are called the Roughriders?
- That was only for a bit.

15:31.637 --> 15:33.505
Ottawa is called the Redblacks now.

15:33.606 --> 15:36.408
- It's not perfect, but it's OK!
- It is OK. So I feel

15:36.509 --> 15:38.944
like this argument is no longer
totally about me, so I'm just

15:39.045 --> 15:41.079
- gonna scoot pass you...
- You're not going anywhere!

15:41.180 --> 15:44.282
- Jethro, get away from me!
- (Evangeline screaming)

15:44.383 --> 15:47.452
- (gasping)
- What? What? Was that your...

15:47.553 --> 15:50.222
- was that your favourite vase?
- Those were my father's ashes,

15:50.323 --> 15:54.426
- you brute!
- Ohhh...

15:54.527 --> 15:56.595
- (dramatic music)
- (dog barking)

15:56.696 --> 15:59.431
- Andy!
- Hey, I brought vino!

15:59.532 --> 16:01.433
Turn around, Andy,
we gotta get out of here!

16:01.534 --> 16:03.468
Dad was right, this place is bad!

16:03.569 --> 16:05.203
- Let's go!
- Oh, oh my!

16:05.304 --> 16:07.339
Come back here and face justice

16:07.440 --> 16:10.667
- like a man!
- Mark, what is going on?!

16:14.231 --> 16:15.421
Why do these people want to kill you?

16:15.433 --> 16:19.168
Just get inside first, come on!
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:19.269 --> 16:21.270
OK, OK. OK, OK, OK.

16:21.372 --> 16:23.306
OK, let's go. Let's try this again.

16:23.407 --> 16:25.842
- (busy signal)
- OK, OK, OK. Busy, still busy.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.144
Why wouldn't it be? Why would the only

16:28.245 --> 16:30.546
police officer in this town
not have call waiting?!

16:30.647 --> 16:33.583
- Mark, what the hell is going on?
- OK, so turns out I sort of

16:33.684 --> 16:35.585
almost hooked up with Evangeline,

16:35.686 --> 16:37.920
who's like married to Jethro,
who's this former

16:38.022 --> 16:40.323
- CFL star monster...
- Wait, wait, wait.

16:40.424 --> 16:43.559
That was Jethro Boyd?
Like, seven times CFL MVP Jethro Boyd?

16:43.660 --> 16:45.461
I don't know.
What... How do you know that?

16:45.562 --> 16:47.463
I love the CFL. It's a harder league.

16:47.564 --> 16:49.899
Just deeper end zones,
only three downs, it's great.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.635
Shut up! Where's Dad?
He'll save us. Dad?!

16:52.736 --> 16:54.670
- He's still in Summerside.
- Oh, my God, that's right.

16:54.772 --> 16:57.140
There's nothing to save us now.
They're gonna kill me, Andy.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.575
Those carnies, they probably got
some crazy punishment in store

16:59.676 --> 17:02.145
for me. They're gonna skin me alive.
They're gonna take my dick, Andy.

17:02.246 --> 17:04.180
Oh! Andy, they're gonna take my dick.

17:04.281 --> 17:06.593
- They're not gonna take your dick.
- I think they might...

17:06.684 --> 17:11.387
No, they're not. Look, look.
For all we know, we lost them.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.190
(indistinct clamoring)

17:14.924 --> 17:16.692
OK. Yeah, they probably
have your address on file.

17:16.794 --> 17:18.694
- What's going on?
- Oh, God... There's a bunch

17:18.796 --> 17:20.730
of carnival folk outside,
Bryn, and they wanna kill me!

17:20.830 --> 17:23.900
- Are the furry twins there?
- Did you hear what I said, Bryn?! They want to kill me!

17:24.001 --> 17:26.202
I'm gonna go put on something nice.

17:26.303 --> 17:28.604
- I'm gonna go talk to them.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.331
Don't do that, Andy. Don't talk to them.
There's no talking here.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.776
- No talking. No talking.
- Mark. It's OK. Look...

17:33.877 --> 17:37.580
- (soft music)
- This is what big brothers do.

17:37.681 --> 17:41.050
- Oh, shit!
- We should have run when we had the chance, Andy, you idiot!

17:41.151 --> 17:43.086
Mark, you have been found
guilty of two counts

17:43.187 --> 17:46.089
of carnival impropriety and in
accordance with carnival law,

17:46.190 --> 17:48.558
Jethro has chosen trial by combat.

17:48.659 --> 17:50.426
- What?!
- OK. We respect your custom,

17:50.527 --> 17:52.295
but isn't a fight to
the death a bit extreme?

17:52.396 --> 17:54.530
It's not to death.
It's just to a certain degree of injury.

17:54.631 --> 17:56.104
Oh, it's just to a certain
degree of injury, Mark.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.801
"A certain degree of injury?!"
Then you fight him, Andy!

17:59.298 --> 18:00.585
OK. Mark! Mark, Mark, Mark!

18:00.671 --> 18:03.072
His one weakness is he
overruns his passes.

18:03.173 --> 18:04.607
This isn't football, you moron!

18:04.675 --> 18:08.144
What the hell are you talking about?!
Oh, my God! He's ripped!

18:08.245 --> 18:10.079

This is my property,

Please and thank you!

19:02.299 --> 19:04.567
Sorry, sir, this is an internal matter

pertaining to official
carnival business.

19:06.503 --> 19:08.404

I know all about your "carnival law".

could accept reconciliation
in goods rather than blood

19:44.908 --> 19:47.210
If we piled up these skulls,

they'd make a nice

OK. Well, I'm sure everything
is just fine, but just in case

probably all hop in the truck
