00:00.600 --> 00:01.900
Adult adam:
<i> For every family,</i>

00:01.902 --> 00:04.937
<i> Thanksgiving is a day</i>
<i> filled with tradition.</i>

00:04.939 --> 00:05.671
<i> But for the goldbergs,</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:09.108
<i> That tradition came</i>
<i> with an extra helping</i>
<i> of crazy.</i>

00:09.110 --> 00:11.643
<i> Every year, my mom would</i>
<i> cheese and marshmallow</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:12.411
<i> Everything in sight.</i>

00:12.413 --> 00:15.247
<i> Every year, my brother</i>
<i> would gorge himself</i>
<i> on half a turkey</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:16.648
<i> And pass out in a food coma.</i>

00:16.650 --> 00:19.318
<i> Every year, I'd bond with</i>
<i> my dad over a game of football</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:22.588
<i> And astound him with</i>
<i> my total lack of knowledge.</i>

00:22.590 --> 00:23.889
It's like
the throwing one knows

00:23.891 --> 00:26.692
Exactly where
the running one is going.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.895
Adult adam: <i> Every year,</i>
<i> pops would give a tipsy toast</i>

00:29.897 --> 00:30.729
<i> About an old girlfriend.</i>

00:30.731 --> 00:32.598
And, sure,
I wake up every morning,

00:32.600 --> 00:36.468
And I wonder,
"what if I stayed
with her in singapore

00:36.470 --> 00:38.904
"and learned
her exotic customs?"

00:38.906 --> 00:42.107
Point is
we all make our choices.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.175
To family.

00:43.177 --> 00:43.842
All: To family.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.012
Adult adam: <i> Every year,</i>
<i> my eccentric uncle marvin</i>
<i> would visit...</i>

00:47.014 --> 00:48.280
Delorean!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.782
<i> ...Get in a huge fight</i>
<i> with my dad...</i>

00:49.784 --> 00:52.718
Come on! I'm not staying
where I'm not wanted!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.154
<i> ...And storm out</i>
<i> with one of our pies.</i>

00:55.156 --> 00:56.688
Good day to you, sir!

00:56.690 --> 00:57.289
Good day to you!

00:57.291 --> 00:59.258
<i> And every year,</i>
<i> my mom would force erica</i>

00:59.260 --> 01:01.260
<i> To spend days prepping</i>
<i> and cooking with her.</i>

01:01.262 --> 01:05.998
This sacred recipe box
was your nana's most
prized possession,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.500
And we will continue
the tradition

01:08.502 --> 01:12.204
By firing up the stove
by 5:00 a.M. Sharp tomorrow.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.773
And if all goes smoothly,
by 9:00 a.M.,

01:14.775 --> 01:18.110
We'll be elbow deep
in a 20-pound butterball.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.012
Or we nuke
some hungry-man dinners

01:20.014 --> 01:20.779
And call it a day.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.815
Wow. I didn't know
you were in the business

01:22.817 --> 01:25.584
Of destroying all your nana's
favorite things.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.520
You know, while you're at it,
why don't you just smash

01:28.522 --> 01:30.889
Her precious
figurine collection,

01:30.891 --> 01:32.624
Smash everything she loved,

01:32.626 --> 01:33.525
Take this poker,

01:33.527 --> 01:36.929
And smash my face in?
Because nana loved this, too.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.264
My god, I'll just cook
the stupid meal.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.332
Yay! (laughing)

01:40.334 --> 01:41.333
Oh, we're gonna have
so much fun.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.469
Adult adam: <i> And it wasn't</i>
<i> a goldberg thanksgiving</i>

01:43.471 --> 01:44.736
<i> Unless my mom tripled up</i>
<i> her workouts</i>

01:44.738 --> 01:48.207
<i> So she could justify gorging</i>
<i> herself for 24 hours straight.</i>

01:48.209 --> 01:52.578
(singsong voice) who's ready
for some jazzercise?

01:52.580 --> 01:54.146
People with no shame?

01:54.148 --> 01:55.481
Hey.

01:55.483 --> 01:59.118
Come on, lazy buns.
Let's earn that stuffing.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.787
(up tempo music plays)

02:02.889 --> 02:04.556
<i> ¶ come on, come on</i>

02:04.558 --> 02:06.291
<i> ¶ and work that boogie body ¶</i>

02:06.293 --> 02:08.927
And whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!

02:08.929 --> 02:09.928
Join in!

02:09.930 --> 02:12.564
Oh, I'd like to,
but I'm lying.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.632
Well, make fun
all you want,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.701
But you wouldn't last
a minute in my class.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.069
I get the feeling
I'd manage.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.671
Put your money
where your mouth is.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.372
Come to class with me.

02:20.374 --> 02:23.876
When you collapse halfway
through from exhaustion,

02:23.878 --> 02:24.476
I win.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.246
And then, we jazzercise
three days a week
for a month.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.081
So, somehow,
this has become a ploy

02:29.083 --> 02:30.182
To get me to hang
with you.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.350
It is moving
in that direction, yes.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.952
Well, when I prove you wrong
and do finish,

02:33.954 --> 02:37.956
I don't have to help
you make thanksgiving
dinner this year.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.792
Deal.
You ready for this?

02:41.027 --> 02:43.295
Look at me.
I'm jazzercising.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.763
I'm a sad mom
with no shame.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.267
No, don't join in.
I'm mocking you.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.501
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:49.503 --> 02:55.440
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:55.775 --> 02:56.708
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:56.710 --> 03:00.412
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:00.414 --> 03:02.848
Adult adam:
<i> It was November 22,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:02.850 --> 03:06.185
<i> And I was spending the day</i>
<i> with my friend, video games.</i>

03:06.187 --> 03:08.687
<i> We had</i>
<i> quite a history together.</i>

03:08.689 --> 03:09.588
<i> First, there was</i> atari.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.123
(video game beeping)
look at those graphics.

03:11.125 --> 03:14.226
I'll never get bored
of this, ever.

03:14.561 --> 03:18.130
<i> Then, there was</i>
<i> in television.</i>

03:18.631 --> 03:20.365
It's like I'm skiing
in real life.

03:20.367 --> 03:24.303
(blows)
<i> and then came the</i>
<i> greatest console of them all,</i>

03:24.305 --> 03:26.171
<i> Nintendo.</i>

03:26.806 --> 03:28.807
Yes! First place!

03:28.809 --> 03:29.875
What is this?
What am I looking at?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.677
It's <i> track & field.</i>
I just won a gold medal.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.713
A video game
with people running
and jumping.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.083
Why don't you go outside
and run and jump
like a regular kid?

03:38.085 --> 03:40.652
(groans) you never like
the stuff I like.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.787
Why don't you play
with the boy?

03:41.789 --> 03:44.456
No can do.
Gives me finger cramps.

03:44.458 --> 03:48.560
And I need these hands
to massage the ladies' feet.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.428
It's his closer.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.029
All right,
this conversation's been

03:51.031 --> 03:51.797
Bad from top to bottom.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.665
Adult adam:
<i> My dad may not have</i>
<i> understood me,</i>

03:53.667 --> 03:57.302
<i> But thanksgiving meant</i>
<i> the arrival of someone</i>
<i> who did.</i>

03:57.304 --> 03:58.403
Did someone call
the butcher?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.205
'cause the beefcake
has arrived.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.007
Okay.
"mur-man,"
bring it in here.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.642
Bro, ooh,
I love-a this face.
Ohh.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.043
I love it.
Stop!

04:05.045 --> 04:05.944
Sorry.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.346
(sighs)
what's with the outfit?

04:07.348 --> 04:09.615
It's actually the
crockett'n tubbs collection.

04:09.617 --> 04:12.050
The ladies love it.
It's the white linen, man.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.485
You want to feel it?

04:13.487 --> 04:14.519
No.
Come on. Feel it.

04:14.521 --> 04:15.921
No.
Just feel it!

04:15.923 --> 04:17.756
Uncle, marv!
(laughing) hey!

04:17.758 --> 04:19.358
What's up?
Hey, buddy.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.294
Uncle, marv!
Look at this kid!
(laughs)

04:22.296 --> 04:22.961
Looking good, dude.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.697
I'm feeling good, dude.
I lost half a pound.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.666
And then they bumped me up
to assistant manager

04:27.668 --> 04:29.201
Down at the beeper bayou
in trenton.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.036
You sell beepers now?
No way.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.939
Oh, yeah. Growth industry.
Wave of the future.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.675
I'm gonna ride that wave
right into retirement.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.876
Free samples? Bing!

04:37.878 --> 04:39.244
We get free beepers?
Yes!

04:39.246 --> 04:41.780
So impractical
for a child.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.582
No. You can't
give them beepers.

04:43.584 --> 04:44.850
They look
like drug dealers.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.385
No, they look like doctors.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.119
(chuckling) come on.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.720
I'm gonna go page myself
for no reason.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.456
That's the spirit.
Look at this kid.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.591
Okay.
Let's get you set up.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.594
Where's your garbage bag
full of laundry
for my wife to do?

04:55.596 --> 04:57.863
No, no, no.
I'm fine for this visit.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.666
I'm staying in a hotel
down in abington.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.600
Hotel?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.068
With an "h,"
not an "m?"

05:03.070 --> 05:04.436
Yeah. It's got
all the perks, man.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.038
Uncle marv,
you want to go play
<i> double dragon</i> with me?

05:06.040 --> 05:09.141
<i> Nintendo power</i> magazine
said it wasn't coming
out till January.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.677
You read <i> np</i> monthly?
What, are you kidding me?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.011
That's how I get
all my news, kid.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.079
Let's go.
Get the hell in there!

05:14.081 --> 05:16.348
Adult adam: <i> While my dad</i>
<i> was trying to keep his cool</i>
<i> with his brother,</i>

05:16.350 --> 05:19.885
<i> My mom was about to turn up</i>
<i> the heat in jazzercise class.</i>

05:19.887 --> 05:22.821
Dear lord, it's like
a <i> twilight zone</i> world

05:22.823 --> 05:23.522
Where everyone is you.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.525
Just zip it and go put on
your workout gear.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.493
This is
my workout gear.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.128
(laughs)

05:31.698 --> 05:34.299
That's what you're gonna
wear to get in the groove?

05:34.301 --> 05:34.833
Are you insane?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.702
Some might say
what you're wearing
is insane.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.772
For your information,
spandex wicks away sweat

05:40.774 --> 05:43.575
While enhancing muscle tone
and skeletal girth.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.710
Watch and learn.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.545
You ladies ready
to sweat?

05:46.547 --> 05:47.446
All: Yeah.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.014
Reynaldo's
an ex-marine.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.882
I told him
not to go easy on us.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.284
Okay,
you didn't tell me...

05:52.286 --> 05:53.952
Sorry.
A bet's a bet.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.754
That's a deal
that can't be broken.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.356
Adult adam: <i> My sister</i>
<i> was starting to realize</i>

05:57.358 --> 05:59.124
<i> That she might have</i>
<i> gotten in over her head.</i>

05:59.126 --> 06:01.626
(upbeat music plays)
<i> for the next hour, my mom</i>

06:01.628 --> 06:04.062
<i> Lunged, squatted, and grooved</i>

06:04.064 --> 06:06.031
<i> With everything she had.</i>

06:06.232 --> 06:07.966
<i> And erica...</i>

06:07.968 --> 06:09.434
<i> Eh, she was fine.</i>

06:09.436 --> 06:12.204
And cool down.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.138
Whew!
(laughs)

06:13.140 --> 06:15.073
I almost
broke a sweat there.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.409
(panting) but you...

06:17.411 --> 06:17.976
Erica: I won.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.179
Now I don't have to
spend time cooking
with you all day.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.748
It's a thanksgiving
miracle.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.882
But it's tradition.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.118
Mmm, sorry.
Bet's a bet.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.286
That's a deal
that can't be broken.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.089
Adult adam: <i> As my mom's</i>
<i> thanksgiving was</i>
<i> falling apart,</i>

06:31.091 --> 06:33.191
<i> I was having a blast</i>
<i> with my uncle.</i>

06:33.193 --> 06:36.328
Marvin: You're like
rain man with this.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.096
You're unbeatable.
Like, what is
your secret?

06:38.098 --> 06:39.030
I have
a small social circle.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.800
Adult adam: <i> After three</i>
<i> awesome hours of video games,</i>

06:41.802 --> 06:42.701
<i> We needed a break.</i>

06:42.703 --> 06:45.070
<i> So we went to see a movie</i>
<i> about video games,</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:46.905
The wizard,
<i> a classic '80s drama</i>

06:46.907 --> 06:48.640
<i> About a boy</i>
<i> who wins a fortune</i>

06:48.642 --> 06:51.443
<i> In the world's biggest</i>
<i> video-game competition.</i>

06:51.445 --> 06:53.378
<i> I love the power glove.</i>

06:53.913 --> 06:54.646
<i> It's so bad.</i>

06:54.648 --> 06:56.214
You know it's based
on a true story?

06:56.216 --> 06:58.950
I'm pretty sure everything
in this movie is fake.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.953
Look, I'm the adult, okay?
So I'm always right.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.791
Just eat your popcorn.
It makes your brain grow.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.393
That movie was
so awesome!

07:08.395 --> 07:08.927
Oh, man.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.530
And you're such
a better player than
that mute kid.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.497
Oh, man,
if I were you,

07:12.499 --> 07:14.833
I would consider dropping
out of school altogether

07:14.835 --> 07:16.468
And just playing
video games full time.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.437
No. Nobody's
quitting school.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.539
I'm just trying to
encourage your son.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.206
To drop out.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.607
It's a figure of speech,
mur.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.276
It's like,
"hey, it's raining
cats and dogs,"

07:24.278 --> 07:26.278
Or, "you can't drink
in the park here."

07:26.280 --> 07:28.713
Can't you just not be you
for once?

07:28.715 --> 07:29.414
(groans) fine.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.516
How about I don't
encourage him to be
better at anything?

07:31.518 --> 07:33.485
(sighs)
that's all I'm asking.
(sighs)

07:33.487 --> 07:35.520
Well, buddy,
you're gonna have to

07:35.522 --> 07:37.756
Listen to your old man
on this one.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.791
But not I.
I bought you something.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.560
Consider it an early
birthday present, okay?

07:41.562 --> 07:44.696
Or a late one, depending on
when your birthday is.

07:45.331 --> 07:48.266
(vocalizes angelically)

07:49.569 --> 07:50.268
No way.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.436
Adult adam: <i> Yes way.</i>
(choir vocalizes)

07:51.438 --> 07:53.505
<i> It was the</i>
<i> nintendo power glove.</i>

07:53.507 --> 07:55.974
<i> It was magical,</i>
<i> and it was mine.</i>

07:55.976 --> 07:59.344
I can't take this.
It's too much.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.178
With my guidance,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.447
You are going to become
the greatest player

08:02.449 --> 08:03.748
That the nintendo universe
has ever seen.

08:03.750 --> 08:07.319
With my help,
there will be no
mario pipe unsearched,

08:07.321 --> 08:11.289
No space un-invaded,
no donkey un-konged!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.425
You maniac.
(laughs)

08:13.427 --> 08:14.326
What's he up to, al?

08:14.328 --> 08:16.995
Laughing, having fun,
supporting adam...

08:16.997 --> 08:18.230
It doesn't make
any sense.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.865
Uh, I think
he's just laughing

08:19.867 --> 08:22.100
And having fun
and supporting adam.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.269
That's crazy.
Nobody does that.

08:24.271 --> 08:28.006
Do you think maybe you're
a little tiny bit jealous

08:28.008 --> 08:30.242
Of the connection your
brother has with your son?

08:30.244 --> 08:32.110
Me?
Jealous of marvin?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.980
The man who claims
to have invented
the rectangle.

08:34.982 --> 08:35.580
(scoffs)

08:35.582 --> 08:36.982
Adult adam:
<i> But for the first time ever,</i>

08:36.984 --> 08:41.686
<i> Uncle marvin had something</i>
<i> my dad didn't have... Me.</i>

08:41.688 --> 08:43.555
(both laughing)

08:44.357 --> 08:46.091
<i> It was thanksgiving morning,</i>
<i> and my dad decided</i>

08:46.093 --> 08:49.194
<i> To connect with me for</i>
<i> the best reason possible.</i>

08:49.196 --> 08:51.463
<i> To stop his brother</i>
<i> from doing it.</i>

08:51.465 --> 08:52.964
Hey, champ.
What you up to?

08:52.966 --> 08:53.832
I'm watching
the parade.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.635
Snoopy balloon's catching
a pretty heavy breeze.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.235
Good stuff.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.505
Hey, how would you like
to play some video games.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.241
You know, like <i> froggerman</i>
or <i> donkey kid.</i>

09:03.243 --> 09:05.844
You want to
play video games?

09:05.846 --> 09:08.613
Oh, yeah!
I love video games.

09:08.615 --> 09:09.414
They're not
a waste of time,

09:09.416 --> 09:13.118
And you learn
valuable lessons,
even though they're dumb.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.053
(electronic music plays)
murray: Not working.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.522
The damn thing's
not working!

09:17.524 --> 09:19.291
You're swinging it.
Stop swinging.

09:19.293 --> 09:20.659
I'm batting?
I thought I was pitching.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.129
What are you doing?
Just move like a normal
human would.

09:24.131 --> 09:24.963
What's wrong with my guy?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.498
Why is he squatting?
It looks like he's sick.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.967
He's just bunting.
Stop bunting!

09:28.969 --> 09:29.734
I can't stop bunting!

09:29.736 --> 09:31.803
Just push the pause button.
Well, which is
the pause button?

09:31.805 --> 09:36.207
Stop mashing the buttons
with your giant
sausage fingers.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.910
Okay!
Now you're aggravating me!

09:38.912 --> 09:39.778
Get this off of me!

09:39.780 --> 09:42.414
It's stuck on my
normal-sized fingers!

09:42.416 --> 09:44.249
No... Be gentle.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.885
No! No!

09:46.887 --> 09:47.852
You broke it!

09:47.854 --> 09:50.922
You broke my favorite thing
in the world!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.958
You ruin everything!

09:52.960 --> 09:55.560
Adult adam: <i> As my father took</i>
<i> a big swing and missed,</i>

09:55.562 --> 09:58.697
<i> My mother was feeling</i>
<i> the effects of her own loss.</i>

09:58.699 --> 10:01.132
Whoa.
I slept for 12 hours.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.235
You know when you get
too much sleep
and then you're tired?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.870
I might
need a nap later.

10:05.872 --> 10:06.805
I slept for two hours,

10:06.807 --> 10:08.673
Had a nightmare
that I'd abandoned you,

10:08.675 --> 10:09.975
And then I woke up
and remembered

10:09.977 --> 10:11.009
That you'd abandoned me.
(chuckles)

10:11.011 --> 10:14.913
So I just came downstairs
to start this entire meal
by myself

10:14.915 --> 10:16.715
Like some sort
of daughterless mother.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.949
So, we're both good
then?

10:17.951 --> 10:20.418
Double or nothing!
Let's go double or nothing.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.720
Give me a chance
to win you back.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.521
Please stop.
If I win,

10:23.523 --> 10:25.290
You have to cook
thanksgiving dinner with me

10:25.292 --> 10:30.028
And learn all my traditions
and never leave my side.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.429
Fine. But if I win,

10:31.431 --> 10:33.565
I get to avoid
this craziness altogether

10:33.567 --> 10:35.200
And go to lainey's
for thanksgiving.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.167
You wouldn't.
I would.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.371
And her family eats
their dinner in front
of the tv.

10:39.373 --> 10:40.872
It's both sad
and awesome.

10:40.874 --> 10:45.143
Deal. But this time,
no jazzercise.

10:45.145 --> 10:45.944
We're gonna power walk.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.480
You mean that
non-running thing you do
every morning?

10:48.482 --> 10:49.114
(chuckles)

10:49.116 --> 10:52.484
Did you know that the
world's fastest power walker

10:52.486 --> 10:53.418
Out-walked a cheetah?

10:53.420 --> 10:55.553
Yeah,
that's not true.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.157
Barry: Ankle weights on!

10:59.159 --> 11:01.760
Okay, power walking has one
and only one rule...

11:01.762 --> 11:05.063
At least one foot must be
in contact with the ground
at all times.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.165
Otherwise,
it would just be running,

11:07.167 --> 11:07.899
Which makes way more sense,

11:07.901 --> 11:09.934
But this is what
you guys want to do,

11:09.936 --> 11:11.269
So it is what it is.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.105
First one
around the block wins.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.774
And...

11:15.941 --> 11:16.374
Walk!

11:16.376 --> 11:17.776
Adult adam: <i> Some say</i>
<i> it was carl lewis</i>

11:17.778 --> 11:19.544
<i> Who ran the most epic race</i>
<i> in the '80s.</i>

11:19.546 --> 11:21.713
<i> But in our family,</i>
<i> it was this.</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:24.582
Stop! Stop power walking
into my body!

11:24.584 --> 11:26.785
The bevernator stops
for no one.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.619
Oops.
Hey.

11:27.621 --> 11:28.987
(chuckles)
slipped up.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.388
You stepped
in dog poop.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.856
(sighs)
nice try.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.425
No, I'm serious.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.226
Really?

11:35.228 --> 11:36.127
Oh!

11:36.129 --> 11:38.096
That was low!

11:38.597 --> 11:40.965
That was low!

11:43.369 --> 11:44.402
Erica: Keep one foot
on the ground!

11:44.404 --> 11:46.104
You keep one foot
on the ground!

11:46.106 --> 11:48.206
You're running.
That's against the rules.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.575
But I'll allow it
'cause I don't care.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.243
Take that!

11:52.311 --> 11:55.046
Yes! Yes! I won!

11:55.048 --> 11:56.881
Beverly: Ow.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.650
Oh, it hurts.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.350
(groaning) ow!

11:59.352 --> 12:01.920
Something happened
in my downstairs.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.689
It's just north
of my vajingo.

12:04.924 --> 12:06.491
Ow!

12:07.126 --> 12:08.993
Murray:
How's your groin?

12:08.995 --> 12:10.361
It hurts.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.964
But not as bad
as my heart.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.066
I lost her, murray.
I lost our little girl.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.737
I get it. The kids would
much rather see
their friends,

12:18.739 --> 12:22.173
Play video games, hang out
with your dumbass brother.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.575
Are we still talking
about me?

12:23.577 --> 12:24.876
I got a thing, too.
I'm allowed.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.279
Well, not today.
Help me over
to that office chair

12:28.281 --> 12:28.980
So I can roll around.

12:28.982 --> 12:33.151
Bevy, you can't cook
thanksgiving
in a roller chair.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.220
I have to try.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.756
Ow! Ow. Ow.
That's it.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.090
We'll order chinese.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.892
Oh, no, you won't!

12:40.894 --> 12:42.127
The stakes are too high.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.361
I need this meal.
(inspirational music plays)

12:43.363 --> 12:47.465
I need to be knocked
motionless by meat
and gravy.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.900
I need to eat until
my pants grow tight

12:48.902 --> 12:51.503
And I move
into elastic sweats.

12:51.505 --> 12:55.673
Will I ever touch that weird,
gloppy cranberry thing?

12:55.675 --> 12:57.008
Probably not.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.444
But I deserve
to find out.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.913
Give me this.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.181
Give me thanksgiving.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.917
I'm sorry, love bug.
I tried, but I can't.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.820
My groin is
out of commission.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.456
Then let me be
your groin.

13:13.325 --> 13:14.826
(smoke alarm blaring)

13:14.828 --> 13:15.994
You're burning
the rolls.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.564
I didn't say 600.
I said 375.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.332
Ohh!
I'm not a scientist!

13:21.334 --> 13:23.368
(blaring stops)
(sighs)
oh, this is hopeless.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.769
You haven't even cleaned
the turkey yet.

13:24.771 --> 13:29.107
I told you, I'm not reaching
my hand in a turkey's butt!
No way!

13:29.109 --> 13:32.143
It's not that big a deal.
Just do it.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.745
(squish)

13:33.747 --> 13:34.345
Oh, no.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.181
Oh, it's all cold
and rubbery!

13:36.183 --> 13:39.617
Aah! I touched something wet!
I touched something wet!

13:39.619 --> 13:41.452
Well, do something.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.822
I'll use the nerd glove.

13:44.223 --> 13:44.823
(grunts)

13:44.825 --> 13:49.260
Don't worry, champ.
I'll get that power glove
fixed for you no problem...

13:49.262 --> 13:51.429
Ooh, boy.
It's in the butt.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.599
Why? Why?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.434
Okay, so, I know
that it's thanksgiving,

13:56.436 --> 13:59.237
And I want to say
what I'm thankful for.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.272
My freedom.
I'm leaving now.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.473
Please, erica.
I need you.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.577
I love barry,
but he ruins everything.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.245
She's right.
I suck.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.247
What's going on?
What did marvin do now?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.882
I'm just here dealing
with the glove in the butt.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.383
Why you got to accuse me
of stuff?

14:12.385 --> 14:13.117
I'll tell you why.

14:13.119 --> 14:14.619
Because you've always
got an angle.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.187
You got some
kind of grift going on.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.956
I get caught grifting
three times,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.891
And he's never gonna
let me forget it already.

14:19.893 --> 14:20.859
Just let him forget it
already.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.560
You brainwashed
the kid, too.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.829
I don't want you two
spending any more time
together.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.531
Oh, well, then you're
really not gonna like us

14:26.533 --> 14:27.932
Traveling around
the country together

14:27.934 --> 14:29.500
Competing in
nintendo championships!

14:29.502 --> 14:30.802
What?
Adam: Like in <i> the wizard.</i>

14:30.804 --> 14:32.337
He wants to take me
town to town

14:32.339 --> 14:33.938
To hustle people
in video games.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.940
It's win-win...
If he wins.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.711
This has been fun, but, uh,
where are my car keys, mom?

14:39.713 --> 14:40.745
How should I know?

14:40.747 --> 14:41.913
Open your hand.
No.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.047
Open your hand.
No.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.216
Mom.
I shouldn't have to
even say this out loud.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.920
No one here is pursuing
a career in video gaming.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.623
You know, I don't
have to take this abuse.
I'm out of here.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.358
No!
I got a perfectly good
red lobster

14:53.360 --> 14:54.726
Right across
from my hotel.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.327
Oh, here we go.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.128
Good day to you, sir.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.430
(door opens and closes)
good day to you, sir!

14:59.432 --> 15:00.965
No, good day to you, sir!

15:00.967 --> 15:04.068
Okay, you're not
going anywhere.
It's thanksgiving!

15:04.070 --> 15:05.637
Murray: Unacceptable!
Yes!

15:05.639 --> 15:06.671
(crashing)
I'm free!

15:06.673 --> 15:09.807
Damn it! I dropped
the orange potatoes!

15:09.809 --> 15:11.175
Erica,
take me with you.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.977
Everybody,
stop leaving me.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.046
It's thanks (bleep) giving!

15:15.048 --> 15:17.882
Have you been faking it
this whole time?

15:19.018 --> 15:20.184
No.

15:20.186 --> 15:22.353
It's a thanksgiving miracle.
(gasps)

15:22.355 --> 15:24.756
No. I'm not going to
lainey's for thanksgiving.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.658
I'm going for the
whole weekend.

15:26.660 --> 15:30.161
I got turkey schmutz
on my hand for you.

15:31.363 --> 15:34.499
Now, this feels
like thanksgiving.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.770
Hey, uh...

15:38.772 --> 15:41.272
I wrangled this
out of the turkey butt.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.941
Toweled it off
for you.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.776
I don't want it.

15:45.411 --> 15:46.511
Come on.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.380
You can't honestly
be angry at me

15:49.382 --> 15:52.216
For not letting you roam
around the country

15:52.218 --> 15:53.351
With your uncle.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.520
He'd lose you
at the first rest stop.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.287
Well, it's your loss,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.690
'cause I could have been
the champion and won it all...

15:58.692 --> 16:03.294
Money, mansions, yachts,
fast cars, fast women.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.264
I think you may be
overestimating the prizes.

16:06.266 --> 16:06.998
Of course I am!

16:07.000 --> 16:09.867
The world of high-stakes
nintendo isn't even real.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.470
Then why the hell
would you go along
with your uncle?

16:12.472 --> 16:16.607
'cause it was nice for
someone to actually
get me for once.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.476
Adult adam: <i> As this landed</i>
<i> with my dad,</i>

16:18.478 --> 16:21.980
<i> My sister was more than ready</i>
<i> to take off.</i>

16:22.114 --> 16:24.349
Going somewhere?
Aah!

16:25.017 --> 16:25.783
Pops, please.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.353
I don't want to hear one of
your adorable, wise lectures

16:28.355 --> 16:30.121
That makes me
a better person.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.589
Fine, I won't mix in.

16:31.591 --> 16:36.427
But did you ever wonder
why this holiday makes
your mother so crazy?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.362
'cause she's crazy?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.997
For sure,
but there's a reason

16:38.999 --> 16:40.098
Why this day means
so much to her.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.735
Because she always made
dinner with nana.
I know all about it.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.069
Well,
what you don't know is

16:45.071 --> 16:48.706
That your mom was 17
when she lost nana.

16:49.074 --> 16:49.774
I didn't realize that.

16:49.776 --> 16:53.177
That box of recipes,
the two of you
cooking together,

16:53.179 --> 16:56.881
It all brings back
your grandmother for her.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.584
Why do you always got to
make me a better person?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.753
<i> (st. Elmo's fire man</i>
<i> in motion</i> playing)

17:01.755 --> 17:03.955
(sighs) come on.
Let's go have thanksgiving.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.758
(dialing)
adult adam: <i> My dad was also</i>
<i> trying to be a better person</i>

17:06.760 --> 17:09.227
<i> By beeping his brother</i>
<i> to get him back...</i>

17:09.229 --> 17:11.429
(beeper beeping)

17:11.764 --> 17:14.499
<i> No matter</i>
<i> how far away he was,</i>

17:14.501 --> 17:17.869
<i> Which turned out</i>
<i> to be very close.</i>

17:17.871 --> 17:20.004
(beeping continues)

17:20.572 --> 17:22.173
(beeping stops)

17:23.475 --> 17:26.210
Hey. Mur-man.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.380
What brings you down
to your basement on
thanksgiving?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.949
Beeping!
What are you doing here?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.751
I thought you were staying
at a hotel.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.587
I have a perfectly good
explanation.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.122
I'm a liar.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.390
But what about
the money,

17:39.392 --> 17:40.925
The beeper bayou
in trenton?

17:40.927 --> 17:43.795
I got fired.
It was totally unfounded.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.030
All I did was sleep
with the boss's wife

17:46.032 --> 17:47.098
For, like,
a bunch of times.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.967
Everything you do
is wrong.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.236
You're right.
I just...

17:52.438 --> 17:54.739
I should just stay
as far away from your kid

17:54.741 --> 17:56.941
As humanly possible.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.711
Well, actually...

18:00.979 --> 18:03.815
That's the one thing
you've been doing right.

18:03.817 --> 18:06.584
And I may have said
some things,

18:06.586 --> 18:09.587
And that
was only because...

18:09.755 --> 18:12.457
I, uh...
I was jealous.

18:12.658 --> 18:13.925
You were jealous?

18:13.927 --> 18:17.161
I was jealous.

18:17.529 --> 18:18.996
Of me?

18:19.531 --> 18:20.264
I mean, yeah.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.433
I'm the guy
who invented the rectangle.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.403
Okay. Are you jealous
of anything else?

18:25.405 --> 18:27.004
(scoffs)
like my cool threads?

18:27.006 --> 18:28.739
No.
What about
my awesome hairdo?

18:28.741 --> 18:29.874
No, I'm good.
What about the fact

18:29.876 --> 18:32.877
That you're gonna
let me borrow $4,000

18:32.879 --> 18:34.445
To invest
in a garbage barge?

18:34.447 --> 18:34.912
(sighs)

18:34.914 --> 18:36.981
Adult adam:
<i> Yeah, my uncle</i>
<i> still annoyed my dad,</i>

18:36.983 --> 18:38.382
<i> But it was thanksgiving.</i>

18:38.384 --> 18:41.085
<i> It was a time for forgiving.</i>

18:41.186 --> 18:42.920
<i> ¶ I can make it,</i>
<i> I know I can</i>

18:42.922 --> 18:44.689
All right.
You get the eggs,

18:44.691 --> 18:46.557
And I'll get
the hand mixer.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.660
Shmoopie.
You came home.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.130
I guess I didn't want to
miss out on our tradition.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.733
<i> ¶ I can see the new horizon</i>
<i> underneath the blazing sky ¶</i>

18:55.735 --> 18:58.769
Oh, my little turkey.
(chuckles)

18:59.838 --> 19:00.872
I cooked you
in my oven.

19:00.874 --> 19:04.275
Okay, come on.
Don't make me
regret this.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.576
Let's go.
We got a family to feed.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.779
Honey, it's too late.
We'd have to start
from scratch.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.048
Hey.
We are goldbergs.

19:11.050 --> 19:14.285
And we're gonna
kick thanksgiving's ass.

19:14.287 --> 19:19.290
Adult adam: <i> And they did.</i>
<i> That day, they were</i>
<i> in perfect sync.</i>

19:19.292 --> 19:22.126
<i> And it was</i>
<i> all my mom ever wanted.</i>

19:23.629 --> 19:24.996
We did it.
(both laugh)

19:24.998 --> 19:28.566
(chuckling) we kicked
thanksgiving's ass.

19:28.634 --> 19:29.433
(glass clinks)

19:29.435 --> 19:32.803
I know I always drink
too many martinis,

19:32.805 --> 19:34.472
And I give a toast

19:34.474 --> 19:39.043
About some beautiful dame
from my past, but...

19:39.578 --> 19:42.380
This is for my wife,
irene...

19:42.548 --> 19:47.318
The most beautiful dame
who ever lived.

19:49.388 --> 19:50.755
Here, here.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.956
Adult adam: <i> And that's</i>
<i> a goldberg thanksgiving.</i>

19:51.958 --> 19:55.626
To lainey.
<i> We stuck</i>
<i> to all of our traditions...</i>

19:55.628 --> 19:56.527
<i> Pops gave his toast,</i>

19:56.529 --> 19:59.297
<i> My dad argued with marvin</i>
<i> at the table,</i>

19:59.299 --> 20:01.165
<i> And barry ate himself</i>
<i> into a coma.</i>

20:01.167 --> 20:04.302
<i> But this year, there was</i>
<i> one tradition that was new.</i>

20:04.304 --> 20:08.272
Move over.
I want to shoot
some ducks.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.107
But what about
your football match?

20:10.109 --> 20:12.176
(chuckles)
don't even try, all right?

20:12.178 --> 20:15.646
Adult adam: <i> Yep.</i>
<i> My dad and I played</i>
<i> video games together,</i>

20:15.648 --> 20:17.582
<i> And it was glorious.</i>
(dog chortling)

20:17.584 --> 20:19.650
Why is the dog laughing
at me?

20:19.652 --> 20:20.885
Because you're
terrible.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.187
(laughs)
I don't know what I'm doing.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.555
Here, you show me.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.290
You hold it like this.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.125
<i> Tell me my life, okay?</i>
<i> Tell me my life.</i>

20:28.127 --> 20:31.162
<i> I watched you...</i>
<i> As dictated by barry</i>
<i> and beverly goldberg.</i>

20:31.164 --> 20:32.964
<i> Don't ruin my dinner.</i>
<i> Come on, now.</i>

20:32.966 --> 20:34.932
<i> You're ruining</i>
<i> my dinner, okay?</i>

20:34.934 --> 20:36.067
<i> Be my guest.</i>

20:36.069 --> 20:37.401
<i> Goodbye.</i>
<i> Goodbye.</i>

20:37.403 --> 20:39.170
<i> Oh, come on, now, murray.</i>
<i> Yeah!</i>

20:39.172 --> 20:42.106
<i> You're yelling at me.</i>
<i> I don't need this crap.</i>

20:44.009 --> 20:46.110
(door closes)
oh, hey.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.212
Can you give me a hand
in making some posters?

20:48.214 --> 20:49.213
I'm trying to advertise
my new business.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.483
What could you ever
offer the world
that anyone would pay for?

20:52.485 --> 20:54.619
We own a mower.
I got a beeper.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.354
Someone beeps me,
I rush over and tend to

20:56.356 --> 20:57.688
All their
landscaping needs.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.825
That's actually not
a bad idea.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.392
I know, right?

21:01.394 --> 21:04.495
I've been posting signs
all over the neighborhood.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.430
"barry, the grass king.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.800
"for all your grass needs.
Beep me."

21:09.802 --> 21:10.534
Genius, right?

21:10.536 --> 21:13.037
(beeper beeps)
ooh. I got one.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.038
(beeper beeps)
and another.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.439
(beeper beeps)
oh! And another.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.741
Idiot... You're a guy
with a beeper

21:16.743 --> 21:20.044
Who calls himself
"the grass king."
don't you get it?

21:20.046 --> 21:22.179
Yeah.
I'm gonna be rich.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.148
(engine turns over)
