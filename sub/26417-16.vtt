WEBVTT

00:01.386 --> 00:02.484
Offside.

00:02.485 --> 00:04.198
God! Offsides again!

00:04.199 --> 00:05.534
Hockey rules are messed up.

00:05.535 --> 00:06.636
Eddie, it's simple.

00:06.637 --> 00:08.185
If a player on the attacking team

00:08.186 --> 00:09.638
is across the offensive blue line

00:09.639 --> 00:11.487
when the puck enters the attacking zone

00:11.488 --> 00:13.228
and if no defensive player is on the...

00:13.229 --> 00:15.615
Trent! Mom needs help with the stereo.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.447
I'm busy, Tina. Why don't you do it?

00:17.448 --> 00:19.950
Well, your Wilson Phillips
CD is stuck, so...

00:19.951 --> 00:21.818
What?! That's not mine!

00:21.819 --> 00:22.953
But I'll go help Mom...

00:22.954 --> 00:24.554
Make sure she doesn't
scratch it up again.

00:26.113 --> 00:28.558
Do you want to play until he gets back?

00:28.559 --> 00:29.960
Enough of these games, Huang.

00:29.961 --> 00:31.862
Oh. Well, we can play a different game.

00:31.863 --> 00:33.230
Maybe one where the rules make sense.

00:33.231 --> 00:35.198
I was talking about you and me, Eddie.

00:35.199 --> 00:37.252
I guess all my signals
haven't gotten through

00:37.253 --> 00:39.050
that adorable thick skull of yours.

00:39.051 --> 00:40.250
The doctor said it's fine.

00:40.251 --> 00:41.988
We should just keep an eye on it...

00:41.989 --> 00:43.723
Wait, did you say adorable?

00:43.724 --> 00:45.458
Yeah. I like you.

00:45.459 --> 00:47.442
Romantically.

00:47.443 --> 00:49.015
I wrote you that note on
Valentine's Day, but...

00:49.016 --> 00:50.062
Whoa.

00:50.063 --> 00:52.131
"...that one day,
we will be together.

00:52.132 --> 00:53.366
X-O-X-O."

00:53.367 --> 00:54.468
That was you?

00:54.469 --> 00:55.585
Okay.

00:55.586 --> 00:57.533
I feel like we're finally
on the same page here.

00:57.534 --> 01:00.473
So what do you say? We
doing this? Let's go out.

01:00.474 --> 01:02.092
Uh... Uh... Uh, I-I... I mean...

01:02.093 --> 01:04.021
I can see this is a lot for you.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.279
Take some time, think about it.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.363
You know where to find me.

we're proud to award
Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse

01:53.727 --> 01:55.093
That's amazing, Dad!

01:55.094 --> 01:56.829
Have you finished the new menu design?

01:56.830 --> 01:59.079
We need it now more than ever
with the silver tide rolling in.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.400
Nah, not yet.

02:00.401 --> 02:02.502
Eddie, come on. You said you'd
have it done weeks ago.

02:02.503 --> 02:03.603
And it was your idea.

02:03.604 --> 02:05.572
I know, I know, and it's almost done.

02:05.573 --> 02:06.940
All I need now is...

02:06.941 --> 02:08.056
the menu and the design.

02:08.056 --> 02:10.143
Louis, my man.

02:10.144 --> 02:12.312
I believe some congratulations
are in order.

02:12.313 --> 02:14.180
Mm, likewise, deputy.

02:14.181 --> 02:15.548
That Prune wouldn't be ours

02:15.549 --> 02:18.084
without you charming our
oldest and boldest customers.

02:18.085 --> 02:20.123
- What's your secret?
- Insult comedy.

02:20.124 --> 02:22.088
Everyone's always so
careful with old people.

02:22.089 --> 02:23.167
They get bored.

02:23.168 --> 02:25.058
That's where the geezer teaser comes in.

02:25.059 --> 02:26.326
- Hmm.
- Exactly.

02:26.327 --> 02:28.149
That's why I'm always razzing Grandma.

02:28.150 --> 02:29.529
Just roasting her, y'know?

02:29.530 --> 02:30.613
But she loves it.

02:34.519 --> 02:36.736
Well, I'm gonna keep
spreading the good news.

02:36.737 --> 02:39.505
We won the Golden Prune, everybody!

02:39.506 --> 02:41.357
Yes! What is that?

02:43.670 --> 02:45.178
Hey, man, so...

02:45.179 --> 02:47.614
I want to talk to you about
something kind of awkward. Um...

02:47.615 --> 02:50.183
Tina asking you out?
She already told me.

02:50.184 --> 02:51.284
She... She did?

02:51.285 --> 02:53.086
Yeah, she's pretty
open about that stuff.

02:53.087 --> 02:55.355
Does not mesh well with
the rest of the family.

02:55.356 --> 02:58.010
We're feeling-bottlers,
not feeling-sharers.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.591
I mean, I gotta respect someone
who says what they want.

03:00.592 --> 03:02.762
Plus, it's always kind of
fun when someone likes you.

03:02.763 --> 03:05.431
Damn, it feels good to
be back in the game.

03:05.432 --> 03:08.167
Whoa. Cool your jets there, hot shot.

03:08.168 --> 03:09.869
There's no way you're
going out with Tina.

03:09.870 --> 03:11.977
Why? Because she's your sister?

03:11.978 --> 03:15.008
- You don't think I'm good enough?
- No. You're too good for her.

03:15.009 --> 03:16.643
I don't want her dragging you down.

03:16.644 --> 03:18.778
Tina is challenging.

03:18.779 --> 03:20.780
I dunno, man. She seems kind of cool.

03:20.781 --> 03:23.182
Maybe a little aggressive,
but what's wrong with that?

03:23.183 --> 03:25.451
I just don't think it's a good idea.

03:25.452 --> 03:26.922
But hey, when you turn 18,

03:26.923 --> 03:29.255
I'd be more than happy to
set you up with Trish.

03:29.256 --> 03:31.324
She likes to... party.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.625
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'm just gonna spit it out.

03:39.626 --> 03:40.766
I failed a test.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.687
We took the Presidential
Fitness Test today.

03:43.688 --> 03:45.188
I couldn't run a 10-minute mile.

03:45.189 --> 03:48.992
Evan, how are you going
to become doctor/president

03:48.993 --> 03:51.127
if you fail a presidential test?

03:51.128 --> 03:53.329
That's not really how it works.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.547
President Taft was a...

03:54.548 --> 03:56.074
No dead-white-men excuses.

03:56.075 --> 03:58.501
I expect better from you. Much better.

03:58.502 --> 04:00.770
And running? Anyone can
run. What happened?

04:00.771 --> 04:02.746
You're right. I'm sorry.

04:02.747 --> 04:05.258
I promise, by next year, I'll be ready.

04:05.259 --> 04:06.576
Good.

04:07.598 --> 04:10.125
And I just want you to know
that I still love you.

04:10.748 --> 04:13.016
Should I have been worried about that?

04:14.652 --> 04:17.699
Wow, old folks
sure get the word out fast.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.454
The teeth are fake, but
the money is real.

04:19.456 --> 04:22.192
Neat. So, hey, I need
your advice on something.

04:22.193 --> 04:24.610
The Golden Prune
and connecting with my son

04:24.611 --> 04:25.662
on the same day?

04:25.663 --> 04:27.248
What did I
do to deserve this?

04:27.249 --> 04:29.666
Dad, I'm gonna need you to
take it down, like, 50%.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.167
I can give you 10%, but that's it.

04:31.168 --> 04:33.436
So, I was hanging out
with Trent yesterday...

04:33.437 --> 04:34.504
Great guy. Love him.

04:34.505 --> 04:35.855
Practically part of the family.

04:35.856 --> 04:38.558
Also, love what's happening here
with you and me. Tell me more.

04:38.559 --> 04:40.653
Well, Trent's sister, Tina, walked in,

04:40.654 --> 04:42.712
and she... kind of asked me out.

04:42.713 --> 04:44.126
Oh, my God.

04:44.127 --> 04:45.454
It's happening.

04:45.455 --> 04:48.118
I've written this rom-com
in my head so many times!

04:48.119 --> 04:50.169
The thing is, Trent made it pretty clear

04:50.170 --> 04:51.488
he doesn't approve of us going out.

04:51.489 --> 04:54.224
T-bone! Why does he hate love?

04:54.225 --> 04:56.893
But I think I like her,
so I dunno what to do.

04:56.894 --> 04:59.095
That's a tough one, son.

04:59.096 --> 05:00.933
Obviously, I would love
it if you two went out.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.333
I mean, think of the
children. Redhead and Asian?

05:03.334 --> 05:04.390
So beautiful.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.451
So rare.

05:05.452 --> 05:08.063
I feel like you're a
few steps ahead here.

05:08.064 --> 05:10.089
But, in the end, this is
your decision, Eddie.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.608
You have to do what you think is right.

05:11.609 --> 05:14.660
Hey, wait.
Didn't I go to your funeral?

05:14.661 --> 05:16.474
Aw, I'm just kidding.

05:16.475 --> 05:17.580
I really got you that time.

05:17.581 --> 05:19.282
Trent's my best friend.

05:19.283 --> 05:20.366
I know what I have to do.

05:20.367 --> 05:21.451
Hm.

05:21.452 --> 05:23.069
Date in secret for years
and then win him over

05:23.070 --> 05:25.067
with some freckled Chinese baby cheeks?

05:26.505 --> 05:27.974
A man can dream.

05:30.511 --> 05:31.795
I figured it out.

05:31.796 --> 05:34.063
I excel at so many
things because of you.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.629
You taught me math. You
taught me how to read.

05:36.630 --> 05:40.069
You assembled my
serious-with-a-flair-to-fun wardrobe.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.214
If you think flattery
will get you anywhere,

05:42.215 --> 05:43.790
then you are onto something.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.542
Continue.

05:45.543 --> 05:47.911
Well, now I need that same
support with running.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.396
So I signed us up for a charity 5K.

05:50.397 --> 05:51.614
We can train together!

05:52.275 --> 05:54.167
That's perfect!

05:54.168 --> 05:55.585
Great idea, Evan!

05:57.905 --> 05:59.522
Teach me how to run!

05:59.523 --> 06:01.340
Oh, no. Who'd you kill?

06:01.341 --> 06:02.642
No.

06:02.643 --> 06:04.177
I gave Evan a hard time

06:04.178 --> 06:05.859
about failing the
presidential running test,

06:05.860 --> 06:07.547
and now I'm stuck training with him.

06:07.548 --> 06:08.898
Okay.

06:08.899 --> 06:11.384
Where does barging into
my house come into this?

06:11.385 --> 06:12.899
Well... the thing is,

06:12.900 --> 06:15.872
I may or may not be awful at running.

06:15.873 --> 06:17.298
Truly, truly bad.

06:17.299 --> 06:19.410
If Evan finds out, he'll
know I'm a hypocrite.

06:19.411 --> 06:20.660
So I need your help.

06:20.661 --> 06:22.712
Well, how bad can it be?

06:22.713 --> 06:23.746
I mean, anyone can run.

06:23.747 --> 06:25.215
Not me.

06:25.216 --> 06:27.712
Every couple years, I
check for improvement.

06:27.713 --> 06:30.573
Okay, Jessica, this is your year.

06:31.317 --> 06:33.422
Let's show 'em what we're made of.

06:34.726 --> 06:35.775
Whoa!

06:39.530 --> 06:41.968
How do dogs do this all the time?

06:43.481 --> 06:44.860
Four legs.

06:44.861 --> 06:47.967
I didn't throw up, so I
guess that's progress.

06:47.968 --> 06:49.572
Yikes.

06:49.573 --> 06:53.824
Well, not exactly sure how
you expect me to help here.

06:54.712 --> 06:56.045
Right.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.082
You're not dressed for running.
I'll give you a minute.

07:01.198 --> 07:03.586
You can do
this, Eddie. It's just...

07:03.587 --> 07:04.887
Oh, God, what was it again?

07:05.990 --> 07:07.824
Oh. Right.

07:07.825 --> 07:09.792
Here goes.

07:10.675 --> 07:11.791
Finally!

07:11.792 --> 07:13.368
I've been watching you
walk up to the door

07:13.369 --> 07:16.549
for, like, 20 minutes. It was
awkward when the mail came.

07:16.550 --> 07:18.284
Yeah. So, about yesterday...

07:18.285 --> 07:20.169
it was super nice, and
you seem great and all,

07:20.170 --> 07:22.071
but I just don't think it's a good idea.

07:22.072 --> 07:24.780
You don't think or you don't know?

07:25.884 --> 07:26.964
Thanks, but no...

07:26.965 --> 07:28.666
Because there's only
one way to find out.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.297
Whoa.

07:31.298 --> 07:33.316
Mango with pistachio? Bold.

07:33.317 --> 07:35.852
What can I say? I'll eat anything.

07:37.254 --> 07:39.622
There's so much stuff I've never tried.

07:39.623 --> 07:41.974
Everything we eat at home
is so bland and flavorless.

07:41.975 --> 07:44.360
Yeah, I've seen Trent's lunches.

07:44.361 --> 07:45.491
Lot of mayo.

07:45.492 --> 07:47.685
Yeah. My family won't do anything hot...

07:47.686 --> 07:50.049
Hot foods, hot sun, "Hot 'Lanta."

07:50.050 --> 07:52.235
Oh, man, spicy food is the best.

07:52.236 --> 07:54.387
I've been thinking about
a few original recipes.

07:54.388 --> 07:55.922
Really? Cool! Like what?

07:55.923 --> 07:58.324
Well, the main one right now
is spicy stuffed pancakes.

07:58.325 --> 07:59.943
Hot, savory, sweet.

07:59.944 --> 08:02.910
And who else is doing dinner
for breakfast for dinner?

08:03.797 --> 08:05.431
You have to make those for me one day.

08:05.432 --> 08:08.067
You... actually like my stupid ideas?

08:08.068 --> 08:09.101
Of course.

08:09.102 --> 08:10.603
But one rule...

08:10.604 --> 08:12.117
Never call them stupid again.

08:12.118 --> 08:14.106
This is the best date ever.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.443
Do you want the rest of
my ice cream? I'm full.

08:17.444 --> 08:19.078
Yes. Yes!

08:19.079 --> 08:20.463
A thousand times, yes.

08:29.134 --> 08:30.384
I had a great time tonight.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.468
Me too.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.929
I promise next time,
I'll remember my wallet.

08:43.111 --> 08:44.051
Eddie!

08:44.052 --> 08:45.920
Gah! When'd you get there?!

08:45.921 --> 08:47.088
Have you no honor?

08:47.089 --> 08:48.723
Have you no respect?

08:48.724 --> 08:50.091
I do have those things. It's just...

08:50.092 --> 08:51.292
Then why are you dating Tina?

08:51.293 --> 08:53.094
Look, I was just gonna
let her down easy,

08:53.095 --> 08:55.463
but then she talked so fast,
and then we had ice cream,

08:55.464 --> 08:57.915
and it turned out, she's, like, awesome.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.267
I-I'm sorry, Trent.

08:59.268 --> 09:00.953
Your sister and I
really like each other,

09:00.954 --> 09:02.753
and we're gonna keep going out.

09:02.754 --> 09:04.205
Okay.

09:04.206 --> 09:06.355
Just don't say I didn't
warn you about Trentina.

09:06.356 --> 09:07.808
"Trentina"?

09:07.809 --> 09:08.909
That's her full name.

09:09.945 --> 09:11.754
My parents aren't great.

09:15.664 --> 09:16.846
Morning, Mommy.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.469
I'm ready to run.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.521
Oh! Sorry, Evan.

09:20.522 --> 09:22.223
I just got done with a seven-miler,

09:22.224 --> 09:24.892
or, as we runners call it, a "7K."

09:24.893 --> 09:26.477
I thought we were gonna train together.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.696
Someday, sure.

09:28.697 --> 09:31.465
But you shouldn't train
with a pro too soon.

09:31.466 --> 09:33.917
As you saw me disappear
over the horizon,

09:33.918 --> 09:36.220
you would lose all hope
of ever catching up.

09:36.221 --> 09:37.405
It'll be demoralizing.

09:37.406 --> 09:38.806
Couldn't you just slow down?

09:38.807 --> 09:40.993
Besides, you have to find
your own running style.

09:40.994 --> 09:42.660
You can't just copy mine.

09:43.261 --> 09:44.512
That would be plagiarism.

09:44.513 --> 09:45.461
Hm.

09:45.462 --> 09:47.398
Sorry. You're right. You're right.

09:47.399 --> 09:49.380
Now, time to get my blood pumping.

09:51.503 --> 09:54.188
But to rally enough
support for a revolution,

09:54.189 --> 09:56.924
they would have to bring
the pain... Thomas Paine.

09:56.925 --> 09:57.975
Born in Norfolk...

09:59.528 --> 10:02.763
Wow, they do a really
great job on the prune wrinkles.

10:02.764 --> 10:05.187
- Who does your engraving?
- No idea, sir. I just put 'em up.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.518
I'll always remember where
I was when I watched

10:07.519 --> 10:09.537
the Golden Prune go up in Cattleman's.

10:09.538 --> 10:10.871
Not sure why you two are so happy.

10:10.872 --> 10:12.106
This thing's the kiss of death.

10:12.107 --> 10:13.274
I'll be back next year

10:13.275 --> 10:15.009
to take it down once
you're out of business.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.293
I also take 'em down.

10:17.329 --> 10:18.562
What do you mean, "out of business"?

10:18.563 --> 10:19.697
Things have never been better.

10:19.698 --> 10:20.881
Oh, you'll see.

10:20.882 --> 10:22.716
These old fogies, they
hear about the Prune,

10:22.717 --> 10:24.685
take over a place, then they die off,

10:24.686 --> 10:25.728
leaving it with nothing.

10:26.604 --> 10:27.694
Good luck.

10:28.557 --> 10:30.624
Heavy is the restaurant
that wears the Prune.

10:34.418 --> 10:36.018
Don't listen to him, Louis.

10:36.019 --> 10:38.632
He's just jealous because he
never won a Golden Prune.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.331
Yeah, you're just jealous!

10:41.886 --> 10:44.030
Hey, is this all the orders?

10:44.031 --> 10:45.373
- I'd have to check.
- Great.

10:45.374 --> 10:46.623
I've got a movie date
with Tina, and she said

10:46.624 --> 10:48.109
if we miss the trailers,
then why bother?

10:48.110 --> 10:49.727
So I planned out the quickest route.

10:49.728 --> 10:51.034
Gotta be punctual for my girl!

10:51.035 --> 10:52.856
Y'know, Eddie, I don't think
I've ever seen you be

10:52.857 --> 10:55.356
happy and productive at
the same time before.

10:55.357 --> 10:57.568
Yeah. I may have been wrong
about the whole Tina thing.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.886
I thought she'd bring you down,

10:58.887 --> 11:00.493
but if anything, you're bringing her up.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.021
Trent, I don't have time for a
lesson on gravity. Gotta go.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.228
I have to say, being Eddie's best friend

11:07.229 --> 11:08.963
is scoring me major Tina points at home.

11:08.964 --> 11:10.197
She hasn't shoved me

11:10.198 --> 11:12.266
or made me talk about
my feelings in days.

11:12.267 --> 11:14.034
Trent, are you seeing this?

11:15.422 --> 11:16.910
Wait a minute.

11:16.911 --> 11:19.052
Aren't these the same
people we sat at 4:00?

11:19.053 --> 11:20.137
Why are they still here?

11:20.138 --> 11:22.472
Ah, they'll bleed into the 8:00 hour!

11:22.473 --> 11:24.392
And half of them just ordered juice!

11:27.649 --> 11:30.717
Why is gold stuff always cursed?

11:33.104 --> 11:34.304
- Hi, Mommy.
- Aah!

11:34.305 --> 11:35.572
I slept at the kitchen table

11:35.573 --> 11:37.141
so I wouldn't miss your morning run.

11:37.142 --> 11:38.708
Yes.

11:38.709 --> 11:39.840
I see that.

11:39.841 --> 11:41.261
I'm ready to run with a pro.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.348
Okay. Great.

11:44.349 --> 11:45.983
Let's do it.

11:45.984 --> 11:48.151
But if we're gonna go at your slow pace,

11:48.152 --> 11:49.290
I'll get cold.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.871
Let me go grab a sweatshirt.

11:52.341 --> 11:53.157
Aah!

11:53.158 --> 11:55.025
Oh! My foot!

11:55.026 --> 11:56.644
My running foot!

11:56.645 --> 11:58.295
I tripped on the chair, Evan.

11:58.296 --> 11:59.596
I saw.

11:59.597 --> 12:01.131
I don't think I can run now.

12:01.132 --> 12:02.833
Let's see if we have some ice.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.202
Hey, when did that homeless
person move onto the lawn?

12:05.203 --> 12:06.478
What?! Where?!

12:06.479 --> 12:07.688
Is he in the bushes?

12:07.689 --> 12:09.907
Lock the door, Evan. Lock the door!

12:09.908 --> 12:11.258
I knew you were faking.

12:11.259 --> 12:13.310
Guess you're so embarrassed
of my failure,

12:13.311 --> 12:14.664
you won't even be seen with me.

12:14.665 --> 12:16.363
I'll just go on my own.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.680
But Paul Revere was cunning

12:19.681 --> 12:23.587
and devised a plan...
light one lantern...

12:32.162 --> 12:34.097
That's why I bring my own bat.

12:35.500 --> 12:38.368
The wood really makes
you focus on your form.

12:45.928 --> 12:47.811
So, how'd I do?

12:47.812 --> 12:50.097
Two words... "Damn, girl."

12:50.098 --> 12:52.333
Did you make me go first
just so you can show me up?

12:52.334 --> 12:53.951
Yes. And it worked.

12:55.370 --> 12:56.682
Hey, I got you a gift.

12:58.407 --> 12:59.473
I left my gift for you at the mall.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.742
This is a gift for both of us...

13:01.743 --> 13:02.826
Cooking school classes.

13:02.827 --> 13:04.283
So you'll have all the skills you need

13:04.284 --> 13:06.215
to make me those spicy pancakes.

13:06.216 --> 13:08.365
Oh, yeah. I forgot all about that.

13:08.366 --> 13:10.734
It was just an idea I was
spitting while mad flirting.

13:10.735 --> 13:12.719
You know what an idea is if
you don't follow through?

13:13.489 --> 13:14.904
Nothing.

13:14.905 --> 13:17.174
You were so excited about
it, so let's do it!

13:17.175 --> 13:19.343
I don't know.

13:19.344 --> 13:20.965
It kinda sounds like a lot of work,

13:20.966 --> 13:23.186
and I have this thing with
school where I hate it,

13:23.187 --> 13:25.357
so I'm not really looking
for more right now.

13:25.358 --> 13:27.518
So that's it? You're just
bailing on the pancakes?

13:27.519 --> 13:28.927
You're not even gonna try?

13:28.928 --> 13:31.755
Whoa. Why are you turning
this into such a big deal?

13:31.756 --> 13:33.657
You sound just like my dad.

13:33.658 --> 13:35.092
I'm just trying to help you.

13:35.093 --> 13:36.660
Well, maybe I don't need help.

13:36.661 --> 13:38.328
Maybe I don't need any of this.

13:39.631 --> 13:40.864
Man, Trent was right.

13:40.865 --> 13:42.132
Right about what?

13:42.133 --> 13:43.519
Nothing. It was just...

13:44.168 --> 13:46.403
Trent didn't feel
comfortable with us dating,

13:46.404 --> 13:48.939
- so maybe we should just...
- Are you breaking up with me?

13:50.041 --> 13:51.275
I guess so.

13:51.276 --> 13:52.928
Sorry.

13:52.929 --> 13:54.931
Well, you should be,
because I'm awesome!

14:07.137 --> 14:08.772
So, let me get this straight.

14:08.773 --> 14:10.641
Not only did you break
my sister's heart,

14:10.642 --> 14:12.042
but then you also blamed it on me?

14:12.043 --> 14:12.993
What's wrong with you?

14:12.994 --> 14:14.444
Look, Trent, I'm sorry.

14:14.445 --> 14:16.661
The woman owns a
Louisville Slugger, Eddie!

14:16.662 --> 14:18.564
I-I panicked! I didn't
know what else to say.

14:18.565 --> 14:20.883
How about, "Let's keep dating,
and Trent's a great guy"?

14:20.884 --> 14:22.101
What even happened?

14:22.102 --> 14:23.819
I thought you and Tina
really liked each other.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.237
I-I did. I still do.

14:25.238 --> 14:27.402
It's just... she kept
pushing me to do stuff,

14:27.403 --> 14:28.769
and I realized you were right.

14:28.770 --> 14:31.493
She's... challenging.

14:31.494 --> 14:32.699
I don't want that.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.747
I wasn't right at all, Eddie.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.765
I thought you were too
good for my sister.

14:36.766 --> 14:38.637
Turns out she's too good for you.

14:45.192 --> 14:46.942
I'm glad you made it in here

14:46.943 --> 14:49.127
without tripping on
another one of your lies.

14:49.128 --> 14:52.114
I think I owe you an explanation.

14:52.115 --> 14:53.899
I wasn't embarrassed of you, Evan.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.190
I was embarrassed of me.

14:55.191 --> 14:57.002
For raising such a failure?

14:57.003 --> 14:59.505
Evan, this isn't about Eddie.

15:02.392 --> 15:03.642
Listen.

15:03.643 --> 15:07.129
You know how most people are
bad at a lot of things?

15:07.130 --> 15:08.130
Yeah.

15:08.131 --> 15:10.199
Well, I only have one thing...

15:10.200 --> 15:11.233
Running.

15:11.959 --> 15:14.386
But because I only have one,

15:14.387 --> 15:16.856
that means I'm really bad at it.

15:16.857 --> 15:19.182
I guess that math checks out.

15:19.183 --> 15:20.526
So, when I saw you struggling,

15:20.527 --> 15:22.294
I realized you had inherited my curse,

15:22.295 --> 15:24.463
and I got frustrated with myself.

15:24.464 --> 15:26.532
That's why I was so hard
on you about the test.

15:26.533 --> 15:28.751
Then you really aren't
embarrassed of me?

15:28.752 --> 15:30.772
Oh, of course not, Evan.

15:30.773 --> 15:32.838
I could never be embarrassed of you.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.142
All right.

15:36.143 --> 15:39.762
The "Protect Our Everglades"
5K is about to begin.

15:39.763 --> 15:42.431
Look at them. So spry.

15:42.432 --> 15:43.499
Get your exercise now,

15:43.500 --> 15:45.818
before Father Time withers your bodies

15:45.819 --> 15:47.836
and you come destroy my restaurant.

15:47.837 --> 15:49.071
Dad, are you okay?

15:49.072 --> 15:50.289
No!

15:51.926 --> 15:54.120
I guess Mommy decided not to come.

15:55.009 --> 15:56.345
Guess again.

15:56.346 --> 15:57.379
You're here!

15:57.380 --> 15:58.981
Enjoy it while you can, slowpoke.

15:58.982 --> 16:01.366
Next time you're gonna see
me is at the finish line.

16:02.403 --> 16:03.585
Please take your positions.

16:03.586 --> 16:06.688
3, 2, 1...

16:29.633 --> 16:31.680
Oh, go on ahead, Evan. Leave me.

16:31.681 --> 16:32.863
Outrun the curse.

16:32.864 --> 16:34.130
Become president.

16:34.131 --> 16:36.351
No. I want to do this with you.

16:36.352 --> 16:37.486
Ohh.

16:37.487 --> 16:38.654
Get out of the way!

16:38.655 --> 16:39.955
Go to Hell!

16:39.956 --> 16:41.573
She's trying her best!

16:46.386 --> 16:47.813
Eddie, what's wrong?

16:47.814 --> 16:49.039
You down about the Prune?

16:49.040 --> 16:50.799
No.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.951
Tina and I broke up.

16:51.952 --> 16:54.536
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

16:54.537 --> 16:56.722
I know getting dumped
is always hard, but...

16:56.723 --> 16:58.974
No. I broke up with her.

16:58.975 --> 17:00.626
You did what?!

17:00.627 --> 17:02.127
Sorry. Sorry.

17:02.128 --> 17:03.645
You just seemed so happy together.

17:03.646 --> 17:05.681
We were. I dunno.

17:05.682 --> 17:07.066
I-I guess it just wasn't a good fit.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.467
Okay, if you're gonna ruin my rom-com,

17:08.468 --> 17:10.301
you're gonna have to give
me a little more than that.

17:10.303 --> 17:13.339
She was always talking about
motivating, following through,

17:13.339 --> 17:14.923
being the best version of myself.

17:14.924 --> 17:15.991
I-I don't know.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.076
I guess the whole thing seemed like

17:17.077 --> 17:18.160
it was gonna be a lot of work.

17:18.161 --> 17:19.728
Ah, there it is.

17:19.729 --> 17:21.415
There what is?

17:21.416 --> 17:23.332
Eddie, you do this all the time...

17:23.333 --> 17:24.933
Bailing when things get tough.

17:24.934 --> 17:27.185
You were so excited to
redesign the menus,

17:27.186 --> 17:29.171
and as soon as you started
to struggle, you gave up.

17:29.172 --> 17:31.098
There are so many fonts.
It was overwhelming.

17:31.099 --> 17:32.741
I know. It's too much.

17:32.742 --> 17:33.893
But being an adult...

17:33.894 --> 17:36.428
And especially being in
an adult relationship...

17:36.429 --> 17:38.113
Means not giving up
when things get hard.

17:38.114 --> 17:39.982
Being an adult sucks.

17:39.983 --> 17:41.049
Yep.

17:41.050 --> 17:42.784
But not always.

17:42.785 --> 17:44.953
And having a partner who
pushes you to be better

17:44.954 --> 17:46.388
makes it suck less.

17:46.389 --> 17:47.439
Look at your mother.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.974
I would never have achieved my dreams

17:48.975 --> 17:50.342
if it weren't for her pushing me.

17:50.343 --> 17:53.362
She's a strong, incredible woman.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.780
She's our rock.

17:55.698 --> 17:56.832
It's okay, Mommy.

17:56.833 --> 17:58.918
A little in your hair...

17:58.919 --> 18:01.553
Seems like Tina was just giving
you the push you needed.

18:01.554 --> 18:03.739
The best relationships aren't easy.

18:03.740 --> 18:05.691
They're the ones you have to fight for.

18:05.692 --> 18:08.660
So if you really like Tina,
then she's worth the work.

18:10.705 --> 18:11.904
Yeah, you're right, Dad.

18:11.905 --> 18:13.382
And I do like her, so...

18:13.383 --> 18:15.250
Redheaded Huangs, here we come!

18:17.570 --> 18:19.404
Um, all right.

18:22.152 --> 18:24.276
Look! There they are!

18:26.179 --> 18:28.814
Those fools need to hurry up.
It's almost mosquito hour.

18:28.815 --> 18:31.116
Don't you dare!

18:36.156 --> 18:37.456
Okay, you're good.

18:37.457 --> 18:38.757
Did we do it?

18:38.758 --> 18:40.495
Yes, Mommy. We did.

18:40.496 --> 18:42.311
Okay, good.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.650
What do you want?

18:49.651 --> 18:51.420
I'm sorry. You were right.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.138
I was stupid

18:53.139 --> 18:55.040
for breaking up with you just
for pushing me to be better.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.408
You're right. That was stupid.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.478
Are these what I think they are?

18:59.479 --> 19:00.913
My spicy pancakes.

19:00.914 --> 19:02.848
I call them... Hot Cakes.

19:06.334 --> 19:07.890
So? How is it?

19:07.891 --> 19:08.859
Mm.

19:08.860 --> 19:10.528
It's very you.

19:10.529 --> 19:12.656
- Has potential.
- Oh.

19:12.657 --> 19:15.610
Well, do you think you
could possibly consider,

19:15.611 --> 19:17.012
y'know, taking me back?

19:17.013 --> 19:18.246
Maybe later, sure.

19:18.247 --> 19:19.631
What?

19:19.632 --> 19:21.917
I'm just not looking to
date a project right now.

19:21.918 --> 19:23.251
I've done the work, but listen...

19:23.252 --> 19:24.720
Take some time, work on yourself.

19:24.721 --> 19:25.721
Then we'll see.

19:25.722 --> 19:28.657
Okay, well, how much time?

19:28.658 --> 19:30.459
That depends, man. It's up to you.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.860
So, how will I know?

19:31.861 --> 19:33.662
These are all good questions.

19:33.663 --> 19:35.497
Can I decide I'm ready right now?

19:35.498 --> 19:37.116
If you think you are.

19:37.117 --> 19:39.001
I'm so confused.

19:39.002 --> 19:40.469
I can't hold your hand on this.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.487
But hey, I'm rooting for ya!

19:47.110 --> 19:49.211
Hey. I heard what you said.

19:49.212 --> 19:50.512
Thanks for doing the right thing.

19:50.513 --> 19:52.316
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

19:53.203 --> 19:55.817
So, do you know what Tina
was talking about or...

19:55.818 --> 19:57.386
Never do, buddy.

19:57.387 --> 19:58.887
But I'll be rooting for you, too.

19:58.888 --> 20:00.639
Earn her back. You can do it.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.291
Ooh, pancakes.

20:03.292 --> 20:04.626
You know what'd be good on these?

20:04.627 --> 20:05.627
Don't you dare!

20:05.628 --> 20:07.172
Mayonnaise.

20:12.496 --> 20:13.776
Dad I wanna help,

20:13.777 --> 20:15.336
but this feels wrong.

20:15.337 --> 20:16.699
I can't change who I am.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.159
Not with that attitude, you can't.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.531
Now go harass some seniors.

20:19.532 --> 20:20.679
We gotta get rid of them.

20:21.338 --> 20:23.048
Dad, I finished the new menus!

20:23.049 --> 20:24.652
Even got it down to one page.

20:24.653 --> 20:26.908
Saving paper on paper.

20:26.909 --> 20:28.908
And they're already in circulation.

20:28.909 --> 20:30.317
Ah, that's great, Eddie.

20:30.318 --> 20:31.812
You followed through.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.097
A little tough to read, though.

20:35.098 --> 20:36.616
Dad. Look.

20:41.171 --> 20:43.489
Gah, this is a young person's menu!

20:46.261 --> 20:47.844
They're leaving!

20:47.845 --> 20:49.145
Eddie, you did it!

20:49.146 --> 20:51.112
You turned this prune back into a grape!

20:51.113 --> 20:52.715
Think you mean "plum," Lou.

20:52.716 --> 20:54.065
Ah.

20:54.066 --> 20:55.445
Can someone tell Trentina

20:55.446 --> 20:57.152
that I chased out a bunch of old people?

20:57.153 --> 21:03.666
