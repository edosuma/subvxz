00:03.169 --> 00:04.129
GEORGIE: Previously,
on "Heartland."

00:04.254 --> 00:05.463
 The problem is you, Val.

00:05.588 --> 00:07.007
You're the reason
this isn't working.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.758
 You want to blame
me for all this?

00:08.883 --> 00:13.346
 Find a new trainer and a
new rider, because I'm done.

00:13.471 --> 00:14.806
I quit.

00:14.931 --> 00:18.226
 I've decided that we should
take Mitch on as a partner

00:18.351 --> 00:19.352
in our cattle business.

00:19.477 --> 00:21.980
And he has graciously accepted.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.606
 Really?

00:23.732 --> 00:25.692
 I was watching you in
Phoenix on the ride yesterday.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.777
You two still have
quite the connection.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.155
Wouldn't it be cool if you could
win the Fall Finale with him?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.406
 You'd train us?

00:31.531 --> 00:32.866
 I think you're stuck with me.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.410
 They found something,
but it could be nothing.

00:35.535 --> 00:39.748
Or [sighs] it could
[sighs] be bad.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.837
[music playing]

00:45.962 --> 00:46.713
JACK: Git up!

00:46.838 --> 00:47.672
MITCH: Hup!

00:47.797 --> 00:49.090
Get up there, hup!

00:49.215 --> 00:52.719
[cows mooing]

00:59.142 --> 00:59.893
JACK: Hup!

01:00.018 --> 01:02.562
Hup!

01:02.687 --> 01:03.897
 Hey, Jack?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.732
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

01:05.857 --> 01:06.691
 Yeah?

01:06.816 --> 01:08.485
 Look, it's been--

01:08.610 --> 01:10.612
been a while since I gave you
my offer to buy into the cattle

01:10.737 --> 01:12.697
and I haven't heard
a thing from Tim.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.032
 Oh, yeah.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.700
 So I was hoping we
could all sit down

01:15.825 --> 01:18.119
together, hammer out a price,
make this thing official,

01:18.244 --> 01:19.412
you know?

01:19.537 --> 01:20.288
 Yeah.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.874
Yeah.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.460
 Look, if Tim doesn't want
to move forward with this I

01:25.585 --> 01:26.628
need to know sooner than later.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.588
 No one is saying that.

01:28.713 --> 01:33.551
It's just that,
well, Tim's been--

01:33.677 --> 01:35.637
well, he's been busy
with some things.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.846
 [sighs] Yeah, I get it.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.765
We're all busy, but
I think it's time

01:38.890 --> 01:40.975
to solidify this partnership
with more than just

01:41.101 --> 01:42.727
a handshake, you know?

01:42.852 --> 01:46.314
 A handshake always works
for me, but I could get it.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.274
I'll see what I can do.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.317
 OK.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.908
 Marnie, it is so good
to catch up with you.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.159
 It really is.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.411
And the family's well?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.161
 Yeah.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.996
Yeah, everyone's great.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.373
But look at you, you're glowing!

02:03.498 --> 02:04.582
 Oh, you're sweet.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.084
I seriously feel
as big as a house.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.419
Don't ask me why I took on
organizing this reunion.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.045
Blame it on the hormones.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.173
 Speaking of which, which
ghosts from high school past

02:12.298 --> 02:13.800
are actually coming
to this thing?

02:13.925 --> 02:15.635
 The RSVPs are so sad.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.345
 Oh.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.264
 Hey, you wouldn't mind making
a few phone calls, would you?

02:19.389 --> 02:21.433
 Oh, my gosh, these names.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.268
Timewarp!

02:23.393 --> 02:25.061
Scott Cardinal's a no?

02:25.186 --> 02:27.856
Well, at least
that I can change.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
Mary Jane Sutka?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.525
 Yeah, she's still TBD.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.485
 But she's not actually coming?

02:32.610 --> 02:33.778
 She better.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.113
She's the most successful
graduate in a year,

02:35.238 --> 02:36.865
in any year.
- Come on.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.907
What about us?

02:38.033 --> 02:40.118
 Lou, MJ's a household name.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.996
With her cookbooks, her baby
food, the skincare line?

02:43.121 --> 02:43.997
It works wonders by the way.

02:44.122 --> 02:44.956
 Weird.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.499
It gave me a rash.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.876
 Having her at our reunion
would really guarantee

02:48.001 --> 02:49.919
a success and maybe mine.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.796
You know, she mentioned my
catering on her website.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.174
 What, that little
blog thingy of hers?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.425
 It has four million
followers, Lou.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.261
 It has four million what?

02:58.386 --> 03:00.472
"Living Your Best
Life the MJ Way"?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.182
 Yeah, MJ's latest.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.892
So she's going on tour with it.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.853
So I pitched her agent about
making Hudson her first stop.

03:06.978 --> 03:07.812
Right?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.147
MJ comes home, you know.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.398
Back to her roots.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.983
It'd be perfect for her brand.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.235
 Mm-mm, her brand.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.154
Sounds perfect.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.364
Let's do it.

03:23.703 --> 03:27.207
[music playing]

03:30.126 --> 03:31.836
GEORGIE: Amy, you up here?

03:31.961 --> 03:32.879
 Yeah.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.798
 Stupid blog strikes again.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.008
"Third place wasn't good enough
for Val Stanton, who just

03:37.133 --> 03:38.551
fired Georgie Fleming Morris."

03:38.677 --> 03:39.761
Fired?

03:39.886 --> 03:40.845
That's what these people
are going to believe

03:40.970 --> 03:42.305
when they read these lies.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.640
 Maybe you need to stop
reading them yourself.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.059
 What we need to do is
start training Phoenix.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.769
Now!

03:47.894 --> 03:48.937
The sooner we can prove those
people wrong the better.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.271
 And we will.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.690
Once Scott gives
Phoenix a vet check.

03:51.815 --> 03:52.899
 Phoenix is great.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.275
He's ready.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.985
 Mitch does have a point.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.948
This partnership should have
been finalized months ago.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.867
 OK, well, what's stopping him?

04:02.992 --> 04:04.327
 Hey!

04:04.452 --> 04:05.704
What?
- What?

04:05.829 --> 04:06.705
 Nothing.

04:09.249 --> 04:09.958
 Thanks.

04:10.083 --> 04:10.959
 Yeah.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.419
 There she is!

04:12.544 --> 04:16.297
Hey, you, hi!

04:16.423 --> 04:17.507
 How are you doing, dad?

04:17.632 --> 04:20.802
 I'm-- I'm feeling
lighter every day.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.178
I've been purging stuff.

04:22.303 --> 04:25.390
Kind of getting rid of
things, you know, junk that I

04:25.515 --> 04:27.267
set aside up in the loft.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.103
 This is awesome,
these trophies in here.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.980
This is so cool!

04:32.105 --> 04:33.940
 You sure you don't
want any of this stuff?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.985
 Hmm.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.820
 Oh, look, is this mom?

04:38.945 --> 04:39.821
She's so cute!

04:43.074 --> 04:44.117
What's that?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.327
 A 20-year-old
thorn in my side.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.121
 "Living Your Best Life."

04:48.246 --> 04:49.289
 That's what I'm talking about.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.707
 Go ahead, take it.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.125
The last thing I want is
anything in this house

04:52.250 --> 04:53.626
with her name on it.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.628
Honestly, if I have to
hear the name Mary Jane

04:55.754 --> 04:57.297
Sutka one more time today--

04:57.422 --> 05:00.175
[message tone chimes]

05:01.301 --> 05:03.428
AMY: What?

05:03.553 --> 05:06.514
 Mary Jane Sutka is
coming to the reunion.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.022
[theme - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

05:25.283 --> 05:32.665
(SINGING) And at the break of
day, you sank into your dream.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.708
You dreamer.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.046
You dreamer.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.050
Dreamer.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.518
 I can't believe this.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.269
How could she do this to me?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.605
 Well, from what I recall, that
girl had a way of bringing out

05:55.730 --> 05:56.815
the fight in you.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.358
 Oh, yeah.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.068
Do you remember the science
fairs or the student council

06:00.193 --> 06:01.361
elections?

06:01.486 --> 06:02.696
You guys were always
neck and neck.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.072
 Yeah, that means at
each other's throats.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.281
 Uh-huh.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.741
"The MJ Way"

06:06.866 --> 06:08.201
 Is she a celebrity
or something?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.953
 No, no.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.579
She just had this little blog
she's turned into a mildly

06:11.705 --> 06:14.082
popular lifestyle brand.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.333
She's no big deal.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.669
 I think she's
kind of a big deal.

06:17.794 --> 06:18.503
 "LouLou!

06:18.628 --> 06:19.921
Heard about a reunion.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.424
I'm making the trek
back to humdrum Hudson.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.591
You still live there, right?"

06:23.717 --> 06:24.968
 Ouch!

06:25.093 --> 06:26.219
 "I've heard a bit about
your business ventures.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.221
Quite the adorable
little empire!"

06:28.346 --> 06:29.681
Really?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.349
 We have shopping
we have to do, hey?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.518
 Yes, we do.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.104
 I have boxes I've
got to unload still.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.105
See you later, LouLou.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.815
 And Scott's here, so--

06:38.940 --> 06:39.899
 Yeah, I'll join
you in a minute.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.443
I'm just going to feed Lyndy.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.028
 Oh, hey, tell Scott
I need to talk to him.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.529
 Oh, yeah, OK.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.322
 I can't believe this, Amy.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.074
Apparently, Mary
Jane has some baby

06:48.199 --> 06:50.410
food that won some stupid
parenting awards too.

06:53.038 --> 06:53.705
No!

06:53.830 --> 06:56.499
[gasps] You buy MJ Bebe?

06:56.624 --> 06:57.917
You traitor!

06:58.043 --> 06:59.586
 Lyndy loves it, OK?

06:59.711 --> 07:01.046
 Amy, how can
compete with this?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.172
She's in my home.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.132
 This isn't high
school, Lou, OK?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.467
The competition is over.

07:10.096 --> 07:10.764
 Hey.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.265
 Your sister cool down?

07:12.390 --> 07:15.477
 No, she's still simmering.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.981
Dad, do you, um, do
you remember this?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.567
 Yeah, it's my first and
only attempt at woodcarving.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.070
 I still loved it.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.696
 I'm glad you got it back.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.282
 Have you heard anything?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.451
You had an MRI, so what's next?

07:31.576 --> 07:32.494
Do they want you
to do more tests?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.579
 Waiting, it's a waiting game.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.872
 But you're feeling all right?

07:35.997 --> 07:38.083
 I feel great, absolutely.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.585
 Dad, I just--

07:40.710 --> 07:41.836
I'd like to know more.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.339
 Yeah, you and me both, kiddo.

07:44.464 --> 07:49.094
 [sighs]

07:49.219 --> 07:50.512
LOU: Hey.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.055
 Hey, Georgie said
you wanted to talk.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.264
I didn't even know
you were in town.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.349
 Yeah.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.975
I'm back for our big reunion.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.061
You know, the one you're
apparently not attending?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.855
 Yeah, well, reunions
aren't really my thing.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.440
 Come on, it's going to be fun.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.443
Especially considering I'm
helping to organize it now.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.986
 Of course, you are.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.321
Well, I'm sure it's going
to be a great evening.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.198
You're just going to have
to tell me all about it.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.157
 Why?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.826
Why won't you come?

08:12.951 --> 08:15.453
 I think you forget that
my high school experience

08:15.578 --> 08:16.705
was a lot different than yours.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.289
Yours was all
student council mine.

08:18.415 --> 08:22.293
Was all detention hall.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.087
 I hope you aren't
implying it was all bad.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.089
Especially considering
we dated for most of it.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.843
 [sighs] Dating you is
the only thing about high

08:29.968 --> 08:31.594
school I choose to remember.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.056
 [chuckles]

08:36.265 --> 08:36.975
 See you around.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.018
 See you.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.901
 Hey, Scott says
Phoenix is doing great

08:47.027 --> 08:48.236
and we're ready to get started.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.363
 OK, but these jumps
are way too high.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.198
 Come on, you saw
Phoenix at the Hunt Club.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.159
He could jump this height
with his eyes closed.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.201
Just watch.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.705
[music playing]

09:05.295 --> 09:06.629
 Georgie!

09:06.755 --> 09:09.299
Look, I told you these
jumps are too high, OK?

09:09.424 --> 09:10.967
We're going to lower them.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.594
We need to let Phoenix get
back into the swing of things.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.064
 OK, I give up.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.815
Why did you want
to meet out here?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.526
 Because out here is where
we're having the reunion.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.070
 But the reunions
at the high school.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.489
 Do you really want to
celebrate in a smelly old gym?

09:32.614 --> 09:33.740
No!

09:33.865 --> 09:35.700
The classmates expect more.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.869
Mary Jane expects more.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.246
 Mary Jane, she's coming?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.247
How?

09:41.373 --> 09:42.749
 She takes my calls.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.668
So we have to make this a
magical evening, Marnie.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.545
And what is more magical than
the twinkling lights and fall

09:47.671 --> 09:49.756
foliage of my dude ranch?

09:49.881 --> 09:50.799
 OK, but that's just it.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.217
It's your dude ranch.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.843
What does it have to
do with Hudson High?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.929
 But, I mean,
that's not the point.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.264
The point is what
would Mary Jane want.

09:58.390 --> 10:02.394
Eau de gym sock or
outdoor extravaganza?

10:02.519 --> 10:04.646
 Yeah, yeah!

10:04.771 --> 10:06.523
You're probably right.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.483
I mean, the most important
thing is to keep MJ happy.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.235
 Exactly.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.195
I mean, this is the kind of
reunion she's going to want.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.282
She's going to be so impressed
with how far I've come--

10:16.408 --> 10:18.326
we've come.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.830
[music playing]

10:22.997 --> 10:23.832
 Ah!

10:27.210 --> 10:28.545
I don't know what's going on.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.421
Do you think there's
something wrong with him?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.630
 I don't know.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.840
Maybe Phoenix just
wants a break.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.216
 No, we can't quit now.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.635
 Georgie, he obviously
isn't in a jumping mood

10:35.760 --> 10:36.678
and we should listen to him.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.804
 But what if he never listens?

10:37.929 --> 10:38.847
What if it doesn't work?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.348
 It's going to work, OK?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.307
We'll fix this.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.308
We're a team.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.184
We'll make it work.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.858
[phone ringing]

10:52.444 --> 10:55.488
 [sighs] Mary Jane!

10:55.613 --> 10:57.073
Hi!

10:57.198 --> 11:00.535
Yes, great to hear
your voice too.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.370
Uh, yes, I did get your email.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.039
I-- I've been so busy.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.999
I'm sorry.

11:06.124 --> 11:06.875
Dinner?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.878
Yeah, that sounds-- oh, you--

11:10.003 --> 11:11.504
you want to bring husbands too.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.630
Uh-huh.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.673
No, no, no, that's no problem.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.216
It-- it's just--

11:15.342 --> 11:20.180
I thought you might know
that my husband and I, we--

11:20.305 --> 11:22.223
would love to come.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.641
[sighs] Yeah.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.934
Great!

11:25.060 --> 11:26.019
OK.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.521
Bye.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.191
[sighs]

11:36.196 --> 11:37.906
[clears throat]

11:38.031 --> 11:40.200
Hi, Peter, how are you?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.117
Good, good.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.036
How's Katie?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.704
Great.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.916
Random question, do you
still have our wedding rings?

11:52.879 --> 11:53.922
MITCH: Hello?

11:56.132 --> 11:56.841
Hey.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.218
 Yeah, Mitch, come on in.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.053
 Jack, sorry to
barge in on you, ah.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.430
But I went ahead and
drew up some papers.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.431
All we need is Tim to sign off.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.974
 Yeah.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.852
Uh-- you know I haven't
been able to talk to him

12:07.977 --> 12:10.146
about things yet, but I will.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.022
I will.
- OK.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.440
Then you know what?

12:12.565 --> 12:13.608
I think we should put
a deadline on this.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.694
That should get his attention.

12:15.819 --> 12:16.945
I know what he's like.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.531
 No, it-- it's
not what you think.

12:19.656 --> 12:25.245
It's-- well, Tim's got a
lot on his plate right now.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.622
 That plate's getting a lot
lighter with every box load.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.998
What's going on?

12:29.124 --> 12:31.584
 Well, Mitch wants
an answer to his offer

12:31.710 --> 12:33.628
and we should give him one.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.797
 Oh, we should, should we?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.841
 Look, Tim, I want to buy in.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.760
OK, Jack's agreed, but
we need you on board.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.556
So what's it going to take
for you to sign over a share?

12:44.681 --> 12:46.933
 Nothing.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.393
No, we should do it.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.103
We all know that.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.229
 All right.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.564
 I just want to make
a couple of edits

12:52.689 --> 12:54.691
because I want you
two to split my share

12:54.816 --> 12:58.153
as well because as far as I'm
concerned, I'm officially out.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.997
[music playing]

13:12.917 --> 13:16.338
 Lou, I'm really
worried about Dad.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.549
Grandpa said that he wants
out of the cattle business.

13:19.674 --> 13:23.345
Maybe he-- maybe he knows
something that we don't?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.638
 No, OK, stop.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.433
Look, like you said, we can't
worry about dad until there's

13:28.558 --> 13:29.976
something to worry about.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.062
And if there was a serious
issue, he would tell us.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.773
 Isn't he already
kind of telling us?

13:34.898 --> 13:35.815
Look at this stuff.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.192
Why is he getting rid of it?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.610
 I don't know.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.487
Amy, I don't know.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.489
[sighs] But if I think
about it too much,

13:42.614 --> 13:44.616
I'm going to go crazy, so--

13:44.741 --> 13:46.034
I'd just rather not.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.249
My old report card.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.835
Me and Mary Jane would always
have to compare grades.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.174
We were neck and neck, Amy.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.886
When did I fall so far
behind in the race?

14:05.011 --> 14:09.766
 Maybe they're just
in different races now.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.477
You've done some pretty
amazing things yourself, Lou.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.561
 Yeah?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.313
Like, lie about being married?

14:15.438 --> 14:17.107
 What do you mean?

14:17.232 --> 14:18.817
 It doesn't matter.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.860
 Yeah, you're
right, it doesn't.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.362
You need to stop obsessing.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.571
 So do you.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.864
About dad.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.658
 Yeah, but, Lou, that's real.

14:26.783 --> 14:27.659
 You don't know that.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.576
Not yet.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.583
[music playing]

14:47.721 --> 14:49.556
 I thought we agreed we
were going to take this slow.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.266
 We don't have time.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.059
We have to keep the pace up
if we want a shot at winning.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.478
 You can't train Phoenix
like you did Flame, OK?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.814
You have to treat him
with a lot more patience.

14:57.939 --> 14:58.940
Why don't we take a break.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.608
We'll get back at it in a bit.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.735
Put out some trot poles.

15:01.860 --> 15:02.694
 Trot poles?

15:02.819 --> 15:03.778
You can't be serious?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.113
 Yes, seriously.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.417
 What's all this?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.669
 Let's just say
I'm working on my--

15:19.794 --> 15:20.962
my little empire.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.550
Shoot!

15:28.928 --> 15:29.888
 Let me give you a hand.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.348
 I'm fine, thanks.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.432
I got it.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.559
 Lou?

15:34.684 --> 15:35.477
Let me give you a hand.

15:38.813 --> 15:39.647
 Thank you.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.276
I heard you and
my grandpa sealed

15:43.401 --> 15:45.487
the deal on your partnership.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.613
Congratulations.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.531
 Thank you.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.492
You know, I went in there
ready to put up a fight.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.704
I didn't expect Tim to
pull out completely.

15:54.829 --> 15:55.663
I'm kind of shocked.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.290
 Yeah.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.250
Well, my dad sure is full
of surprises these days.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.380
Can you believe my
friend was going to host

16:03.505 --> 16:06.007
this reunion in an old gym?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.301
This is going to be so
much more impressive

16:08.426 --> 16:13.098
and professional and formal.

16:13.223 --> 16:15.225
 Yeah, it sounds like, uh--

16:15.350 --> 16:16.184
fun.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.105
 OK, I got your call.

16:20.230 --> 16:20.980
What's so important?

16:21.106 --> 16:22.440
 Well, I just--

16:22.565 --> 16:25.902
I wanted to ask you
once and for all,

16:26.027 --> 16:29.489
are you sure about
this cattle thing?

16:29.614 --> 16:30.532
 Absolutely.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.367
Surer than sure.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.828
 Because giving away
old buckles is one thing,

16:34.953 --> 16:38.331
but the cows, the business--
how can you just walk away?

16:38.456 --> 16:40.375
What the heck are you
going to do with yourself?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.168
 I don't know.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.045
I just want to
live my best life.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.341
[sighs] Maybe I'll travel.

16:48.466 --> 16:52.887
 [scoffs] You hate
traveling as much as I do.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.765
Yeah, Mongolia opened my eyes.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.350
It's a big world
out there, Jack,

16:57.475 --> 16:58.560
I've barely seen any of it.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.645
 Yeah, and when
the vacation's over?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.147
 Come on.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.273
Let's just be honest.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.025
We don't know if
I'm going to see

17:05.150 --> 17:06.901
the end of another vacation.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.444
 What does that mean?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.696
 It means I don't know
how much time I have.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.073
I'm making peace with that.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.950
 Did Dr. Virani say something?

17:14.075 --> 17:16.077
 No.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.537
I just can't keep waiting.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.414
I got to take matters
into my own hands.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.583
I got to take the time
I have left and use it.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.585
 But what about time
with your family?

17:23.710 --> 17:24.502
 I don't know.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.087
I-- you make this up as you go.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.047
LYNDY: [coos]

17:27.172 --> 17:29.507
 [gasps]

17:29.632 --> 17:30.383
 Hey.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.010
 Hi!

17:32.135 --> 17:33.553
 I'm supposed to
be coaching Georgie.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.680
I was hoping maybe
you could watch Lyndy?

17:35.805 --> 17:37.557
 Of course, I could.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.767
You come and see GG.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.690
 Thanks.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.484
 Hi, baby.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.777
 The reunion budget
has doubled, Lou.

17:48.902 --> 17:49.736
 I know.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.321
I know.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.822
 The cost alone of building
a proper kitchen out

17:52.947 --> 17:55.033
here, we should have just
stayed at the school, or--

17:55.158 --> 17:56.034
or done this at Maggie's?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.118
 A diner?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.537
Come on, that is so pedestrian.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.373
 Fine.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.375
We'll do the book
signing over there.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.710
But I'm going to defer to
you on set up because you--

18:05.835 --> 18:07.587
you did a book signing
before too, right?

18:07.712 --> 18:08.963
 Actually, I did
many book signings

18:09.089 --> 18:10.298
on a cross-country book tour.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.883
 Right.
That's right.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.426
I totally forgot.

18:13.551 --> 18:14.886
Gosh, two accomplished
authors in the same class!

18:15.011 --> 18:16.179
 Yeah.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.347
 What happened to
your book, though?

18:17.472 --> 18:18.556
How did it do?
- Oh, it was fine.

18:18.682 --> 18:19.641
Yeah, it did fine.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.184
Hey, the welcome
speech, I was hoping

18:21.309 --> 18:22.852
I could say a few words too?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.938
 Uh, but I'm the head
of the reunion committee.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.189
So technically I'm the host.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.857
I mean, it says so
on the invitation.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.026
 Right, but it also says it's
being held at the high school

18:30.151 --> 18:32.278
and now it's not,
so things change.

18:32.404 --> 18:33.321
 I don't know, Lou.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.614
Let me think about it, OK?

18:34.739 --> 18:35.490
 OK.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.991
 I got to go.

18:37.117 --> 18:37.992
[phone ringing]

18:38.118 --> 18:39.160
 Think about it.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.168
Hey, Peter!

18:47.293 --> 18:48.670
When did you and Katie get in?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.630
I miss her like crazy.

18:50.755 --> 18:51.506
What?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.216
No, no, no, you can't cancel.

18:53.341 --> 18:54.342
I've been looking forward to
seeing you too and spending

18:54.467 --> 18:56.469
the weekend together.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.098
Look, if this is about
that ring thing--

19:00.223 --> 19:01.516
I get it.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.851
Work.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.185
OK, bye.

19:13.945 --> 19:14.696
 Trot poles are done.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.823
Can't get any better.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.867
Amy!

19:18.992 --> 19:20.243
I did the trot poles.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.703
 Um, good.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.706
Yeah, do them again or
you can do the jump.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.665
Just do both.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.044
 OK.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.714
[music playing]

19:48.563 --> 19:51.566
Come on, boy, you
have to do this!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.193
 Wait, Georgie?

19:53.318 --> 19:54.319
Bring him over here.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.408
Take off his tack.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.201
 Why?

20:01.326 --> 20:02.410
 Just do it.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.122
OK, boy.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.665
No pressure.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.042
Let's do this, OK?

20:09.167 --> 20:10.043
[clucks tongue]

20:10.168 --> 20:13.588
[music playing]

20:22.972 --> 20:23.932
See?

20:24.057 --> 20:27.852
He can do these jumps.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.188
 Yeah, you can.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.398
Just not with me.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.572
 You and Phoenix haven't
show jumped in years.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.574
You need to rebuild
that connection.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.284
 We have an amazing connection.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.994
 Yeah, but it hasn't
been consistent.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.165
You've been busy with school,
with Flame, with trick riding.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.584
Phoenix doesn't know what to do
with all this added attention

20:51.710 --> 20:53.712
or demands.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.880
 We jumped perfectly
on the hunt.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.716
 Yeah, but that's
different, Georgie.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.384
Phoenix has always
been a free jumper.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.052
You know, that's
what he loves to do.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.138
When you're out having fun in
the open, he'll jump great.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.682
As soon as you're on a course,
he can feel the pressure

21:05.807 --> 21:08.852
you're putting on yourself
and suddenly on him.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.061
 What should I do?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.939
 Just do things with
him to earn his trust.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.316
Things like grooming him
or going on a trail ride.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.568
 Trail rides?

21:16.693 --> 21:17.944
We don't have time, Amy.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.904
 You had to earn
Flame's trust before you

21:20.030 --> 21:21.239
competed the way you did.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.199
You're going to have to
do the same with Phoenix.

21:23.324 --> 21:27.078
Oh, he just needs time to
understand and forgive.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.330
 Forgive?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.041
Forgive me, you mean.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.542
Because it's my fault because
I've been neglecting him.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.337
 No, you haven't
neglected him, Georgie.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.964
You take great care of Phoenix.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.257
But there is a problem.

21:39.382 --> 21:40.425
And if you want
to keep training,

21:40.550 --> 21:41.801
we're going to have to fix it.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.011
 Do you even want to
get back to training?

21:43.136 --> 21:44.637
You've been so distracted.

21:44.763 --> 21:48.183
It seems like training is the
last thing you want to do.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.810
 [sighs]

21:52.729 --> 21:54.189
 That's the last one.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.941
 Yep.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.861
All right!

21:59.986 --> 22:00.862
Ready?

22:00.987 --> 22:02.530
 Yeah, let's do this.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.828
It's perfect.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.705
Thank you for your
help with this

22:10.830 --> 22:13.833
and for agreeing to be
my plus one tomorrow.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.586
 No problem.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.464
 Hey, listen, I have one
more big favor to ask you.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.759
Uh, it's kind of weird, but--

22:22.884 --> 22:25.220
would you pretend
we're together?

22:25.345 --> 22:26.805
Just for the reunion.

22:26.930 --> 22:27.722
 Wait-- what?

22:27.847 --> 22:28.640
 I know.

22:28.765 --> 22:29.474
 You're kidding me, right?

22:29.599 --> 22:30.767
 I know it sounds crazy.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.352
It's just there's
this person coming

22:32.477 --> 22:35.271
and we have this like intense
competition thing always.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.441
And she doesn't
know I'm divorced.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.193
It's not like you have
to pretend to be Peter.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.028
 Well, I guess that's a plus.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.071
Maybe you should ask Peter?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.911
You asked Peter.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.371
 Mitch, let me explain.

22:51.496 --> 22:52.997
 No, you know what, Lou?

22:53.123 --> 22:57.585
Every bone in my body was
telling me to say no to you.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.921
I should've listened.

23:00.046 --> 23:00.922
 Mitch?

23:13.893 --> 23:14.769
Perfect.

23:21.192 --> 23:24.237
[incoming call tone]

23:24.362 --> 23:25.780
- Hey.
- Hey, Amy!

23:25.905 --> 23:26.781
How's it going?

23:29.909 --> 23:30.785
You OK?

23:33.371 --> 23:35.248
Amy, what's going on?

23:35.373 --> 23:36.416
What's wrong?

23:36.541 --> 23:38.043
Is everything OK with your dad?

23:38.168 --> 23:39.586
 I don't know.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.296
He won't say.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.881
And I heard him talking.

23:43.006 --> 23:48.053
And-- it sounds
like he's giving up.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.888
Lou is in total denial.

23:50.013 --> 23:53.683
And I'm trying to
stay positive, but--

23:53.808 --> 23:56.269
I just can't focus.

23:56.394 --> 24:00.482
And feel-- I feel like
I'm letting Georgie down.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.443
And she doesn't deserve that.

24:03.568 --> 24:05.445
 Come on, babe.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.654
Everything's going to be OK.

24:09.282 --> 24:12.577
[music playing]

24:12.702 --> 24:16.164
[cows mooing]

24:17.332 --> 24:18.500
 Well, this is is, ladies.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.634
It's been a good run though.

24:27.759 --> 24:31.471
[music playing]

25:02.085 --> 25:05.255
Dr. Virani, uh, Tim Fleming.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.758
I'm out here with my cows
and my hands aren't numb.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.011
I-- I mean, I've noticed
my hands aren't numb.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.138
I don't feel the same dizziness,
not for days, so that's

25:13.263 --> 25:14.389
a good thing, I think.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.682
Is that good?

25:15.807 --> 25:16.850
Can you call me?

25:16.975 --> 25:17.809
Thanks.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.899
 Marnie, the reunion
is now happening here.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.484
 Are you crazy?

25:26.609 --> 25:27.569
I just finished sending out
a mass email with directions

25:27.694 --> 25:28.695
to the dude ranch.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.530
 I know, but the
generator blew.

25:30.655 --> 25:31.614
 So rent a new one.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.116
 You don't think
I haven't tried?

25:33.241 --> 25:34.159
There is nothing available
on such short notice.

25:34.284 --> 25:36.036
 OK, wait.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.162
I thought throwing the party at
the diner was too pedestrian.

25:37.287 --> 25:38.788
Look, let's just go
back to the gym--

25:38.913 --> 25:41.624
 We're not going
back to the gym!

25:41.750 --> 25:42.584
I'm sorry.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.336
Everything's fine.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.004
We're just going to set up the
book signing stations here.

25:46.129 --> 25:46.921
 W-- wait.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.215
Did you say stations, plural?

25:49.341 --> 25:51.509
 Yeah, I thought I might sign
a few of my books as well.

25:51.634 --> 25:52.886
Like you said, it's
not that often you

25:53.011 --> 25:54.596
have two best-selling
authors in one year.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.680
 OK, Lou, stop!

25:55.805 --> 25:56.931
I've had enough.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.975
Look, I'm a million
months pregnant.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.936
I am tired, I'm frustrated,
and I don't want to be part

26:02.062 --> 26:03.229
of the Lou and MJ show anymore.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.230
 It's not--

26:04.356 --> 26:05.315
 I am so done.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.191
 You can't be done.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.108
You're the host.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.360
 Oh, now I'm the host.

26:08.485 --> 26:10.070
 --and the caterer.

26:10.195 --> 26:11.154
I mean, what are we going to
do without food and waiters?

26:11.279 --> 26:12.447
 You want a restaurant,
figure it out.

26:12.572 --> 26:13.406
 Marnie!

26:13.531 --> 26:14.282
Wait, Marnie?

26:14.407 --> 26:17.243
[phone ringing]

26:17.369 --> 26:20.413
 Yeah, doc.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.874
What's that?

26:22.999 --> 26:23.958
Yeah?

26:24.084 --> 26:25.627
Cautiously optimistic,
that's good.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.587
I can live with that.

26:27.712 --> 26:28.546
More tests?

26:28.672 --> 26:29.964
No, I'll be there.

26:30.090 --> 26:30.965
Good.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.388
Cautiously optimistic.

26:36.513 --> 26:37.681
[chuckles]

26:37.806 --> 26:41.643
JACK: What are you
doing out here?

26:41.768 --> 26:43.103
I thought you quit on us.

26:43.228 --> 26:44.521
 Mitch!

26:44.646 --> 26:48.483
I've been giving some thought
to that offer of yours.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.277
Are you serious?

26:51.403 --> 26:52.946
 Yeah, what's wrong with it?

26:53.071 --> 26:54.739
 Come on, you're going to
have to come up with a lot more

26:54.864 --> 26:56.741
if you want my share too.

26:56.866 --> 26:58.785
Beef prices are going
up, up, up, up, up.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.829
 Oh, jeez, don't
be ridiculous, Tim.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.664
Now we've all agreed about this.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.790
 Well, nothing's been signed.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.667
Come on, this isn't personal.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.419
This is business.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.379
You know, you're just going to
have to step up to the plate

27:09.504 --> 27:10.422
if you want my cows.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.631
 I did step up to the plate.

27:11.756 --> 27:12.966
I made you an
offer, you accepted.

27:13.091 --> 27:14.592
You-- you can't
go back like this.

27:14.718 --> 27:15.760
 I can do whatever I want!

27:15.885 --> 27:18.513
 OK, OK, OK.

27:18.638 --> 27:22.308
Let's all just take a step back.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.853
What do you say we
meet later at the ranch

27:24.978 --> 27:27.605
and we'll discuss this
in a rational manner

27:27.731 --> 27:30.275
away from the cows.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.277
 Away from the cows.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.529
Sure.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.489
 Hey, how's it going?

27:36.614 --> 27:38.700
You know, I think the diner
food is fine, actually.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.535
I think it's-- it's better
in a way because it's like

27:40.660 --> 27:41.870
a cute throwback to--

27:41.995 --> 27:43.580
to high school, right?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.832
And by the way, thank you
guys so much for doing this.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.208
There's no way I was
going to pay my wait

27:47.334 --> 27:49.377
staff overtime for this.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.504
Seriously, where is MJ?

27:51.629 --> 27:53.506
She was supposed to be here.

27:53.631 --> 27:54.716
OK.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.135
I can't put this off any longer.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.845
Wish me luck.

27:58.970 --> 28:02.140
Hey, you look great!

28:02.265 --> 28:04.392
[glass clinking]

28:04.517 --> 28:05.727
Hi, everyone.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.645
Thank you so much for coming.

28:07.771 --> 28:09.189
It's so nice to see your faces.

28:09.314 --> 28:11.608
Hi!

28:11.733 --> 28:14.778
So sorry, but on the last
minute venue changes.

28:14.903 --> 28:15.987
MAN: Hey, Lou, where's MJ?

28:16.112 --> 28:17.030
WOMAN: Yeah, where is she?

28:17.155 --> 28:19.240
 That's a very good question.

28:19.366 --> 28:22.744
MJ is, uh, she's--

28:22.869 --> 28:23.703
MARNIE She'll be here.

28:23.828 --> 28:24.913
Don't worry.

28:28.249 --> 28:31.378
 Marnie Gordon, everyone,
our reunion chair.

28:31.503 --> 28:32.337
And she's right.

28:32.462 --> 28:33.421
MJ will be here.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.714
For sure.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.591
So, in the meantime,
I was thinking

28:36.716 --> 28:40.512
we could do a couple of our
old Hudson High cheers, right?

28:40.637 --> 28:41.554
Remember?

28:41.680 --> 28:42.722
Go Hornets!

28:47.143 --> 28:49.437
[chatter]

28:51.898 --> 28:55.276
[music playing]

28:58.405 --> 29:00.532
 Here just let me do it.

29:00.657 --> 29:02.117
LOU: I can't believe you came.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.868
I thought you
hated these people.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.745
 Well, I don't love
going back to those days,

29:05.870 --> 29:11.084
but I figured once more for old
time's sake and for a friend.

29:11.209 --> 29:12.293
 It means a lot
that you're here.

29:15.130 --> 29:19.676
 So Tim, I hope you took
some time to think about--

29:19.801 --> 29:20.844
 I don't need to
think about it.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.012
I just need a fair price.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.763
And based on what
he's proposing,

29:23.888 --> 29:25.932
he's entitled to about 10%.

29:26.057 --> 29:26.808
- What?
- So--

29:26.933 --> 29:28.685
 That's crazy!

29:28.810 --> 29:30.770
 Now, I'm just going to have to
stick around it looks like, OK?

29:30.895 --> 29:32.689
Until you can put
on some big boy

29:32.814 --> 29:35.483

big boy prices.

 Lou, Lou, people keep
asking about Mary Jane.

29:42.657 --> 29:44.659

before book tour begins!"

29:44.784 --> 29:46.244
MJ posted this.

29:46.369 --> 29:49.122
She is in Banff
right now, Marnie!

29:49.247 --> 29:50.582
She didn't email us about it.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.417
Did she email you?

29:52.542 --> 29:54.919
Mary Jane Sutka
just bailed on us!

29:55.045 --> 29:57.714
After everything that I have--

29:57.839 --> 30:00.008
after everything we've done.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.968
She's so unprofessional.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.303
I can't even--
- Lou, wine?

30:03.428 --> 30:04.262
 Thank you.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.017
 Georgie, we need to talk.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.185
 Can't you see that I'm busy?

30:10.310 --> 30:11.644
 Why are you so angry with me?

30:11.770 --> 30:13.146
 Because we're supposed
to be a team and you're

30:13.271 --> 30:14.731
blaming me for
Phoenix's problem.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.858
 No, that's not at
all what I meant.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.651
 Can't part of
this be your fault?

30:18.777 --> 30:19.694
I mean, you're the trainer.

30:19.819 --> 30:20.570
Why is this all on me?

30:20.695 --> 30:22.155
 It's not.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.073
 Well, at the rate you
want Phoenix and I to go,

30:23.198 --> 30:24.115
we won't be placing at all.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.742
Then what will the blogs say?

30:25.867 --> 30:27.911
At least I had a chance to
win when I was riding Flame.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.746
 It's not all
about winning, OK?

30:29.871 --> 30:31.664
Sometimes there's more
important things to focus on.

30:31.790 --> 30:33.416
 That's a great thing
for a coach to be saying.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.168
It was your idea for me
to compete on Phoenix

30:35.293 --> 30:36.378
and now you're so uninvolved.

30:36.503 --> 30:37.671
I thought we wanted
the same thing.

30:37.796 --> 30:38.797
 We do want the
same things, but

30:38.922 --> 30:39.923
sometimes life gets in the way.

30:40.048 --> 30:41.216
 That's such an easy excuse.

30:41.341 --> 30:42.384
 Easy?

30:42.509 --> 30:43.718
You think my life
is easy right now?

30:43.843 --> 30:44.719
My dad is sick, Georgie.

30:44.844 --> 30:45.887

It's not working.

30:57.148 --> 30:58.358
This is not working.
I'm sorry, Jack.

30:58.483 --> 30:58.900
- All, right enough!
- But I think I'm out.

30:59.025 --> 30:59.984
 Hold on!

31:00.110 --> 31:01.695
Just, let's keep at this.

 What is the point!

 He's right.

Tim, I can run this
business on my own.

31:19.254 --> 31:21.631
I need Mitch as a partner
if you're leaving.

31:21.756 --> 31:22.799
 What are you talking about?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.592
 What about your
big travel plans.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.011
 It was hypothetical.

31:26.136 --> 31:27.554
 So that's the spin
you're putting on it now?

31:27.679 --> 31:29.514
 Since when do you
believe anything I say?

31:29.639 --> 31:30.515
Honestly,

31:30.640 --> 31:31.808
 I can't keep up with you.

Yesterday, you're leaving.

Today, you're staying.

31:34.060 --> 31:34.769
What's it going to be tomorrow?

31:34.894 --> 31:36.730
 I don't know!

31:36.855 --> 31:37.939
That's the problem.

31:45.655 --> 31:49.200
What do you care if
I stay or if I go?

31:49.325 --> 31:51.953
 Because you're not
supposed to go before me.

31:56.916 --> 31:59.544
 What is that supposed to mean?

31:59.669 --> 32:00.420
Are you sick?

32:00.545 --> 32:02.881
 No!

32:03.006 --> 32:05.717
Maybe.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.428
I'm feeling better.

32:08.553 --> 32:10.263
Jack, I'm not going anywhere.

32:10.388 --> 32:11.264
OK?

32:14.893 --> 32:17.437
 Me neither.

32:17.562 --> 32:19.439
 OK.

32:19.564 --> 32:21.941
So none of us are
going anywhere.

I'm sorry you had to
find out like that.

40:48.865 --> 40:50.325
Jump some logs just you and me?

40:50.450 --> 40:53.870
I know you'll love that.

40:53.995 --> 40:57.749
(SINGING) Had too
many sleepless nights.

40:57.874 --> 41:01.294
Preyed on by what I left behind.

41:01.419 --> 41:03.963
I made this bed I'm lying in.

41:09.469 --> 41:10.845
 You want to jump, boy?

41:14.349 --> 41:16.101
Just take things slow, OK?

41:16.226 --> 41:18.269
Whatever speed you want.

41:18.395 --> 41:19.729
You're calling the shots.

41:19.854 --> 41:23.358
(SINGING) And only I can
drag myself out of it.

41:23.483 --> 41:26.736
I must break from this spell.

41:26.861 --> 41:31.116
And tear this blindfold
to the ground.

41:31.241 --> 41:32.158
 Good boy!

41:32.283 --> 41:34.077
(SINGING) --from this spell.

41:34.202 --> 41:37.163
And tear this blindfold
to the ground.

41:37.288 --> 41:38.123
Whoa.

41:42.627 --> 41:45.463
This is where the
light comes in.

41:45.588 --> 41:48.967
All the shadows in my mind.

41:49.092 --> 41:49.926
 Come on!

41:50.051 --> 41:52.303
Hup!

41:52.429 --> 41:54.889
Let's go!

41:55.015 --> 41:55.890
Come on!

41:56.016 --> 41:56.891
 Hup, hup!

41:57.017 --> 41:58.309
Come on, cow.

41:58.435 --> 42:00.353
Get up there!

42:00.478 --> 42:01.730
 Hey, Jack?
JACK: Yeah?

42:01.855 --> 42:02.939
 Look who's here.

42:03.064 --> 42:05.066
 Well, isn't that
a nice surprise!

42:07.610 --> 42:09.320
 How are you doing, girls?

42:09.446 --> 42:11.239
 We're good, Dad.

42:11.364 --> 42:14.075
 How're you really doing?

42:14.200 --> 42:15.160
 Scared.

42:15.285 --> 42:16.077
 Worried about you.

42:19.247 --> 42:20.832
 OK, look, hold up.

42:20.957 --> 42:22.042
Let's have a little talk here.

42:25.378 --> 42:31.301
[sighs] Girls, uh, I'm
not good at talking

42:31.426 --> 42:37.265
about certain things,
especially things that scare me.

42:37.390 --> 42:39.726
But I was wrong.

42:39.851 --> 42:44.397
I should have told you
what was going on with me.

42:44.522 --> 42:48.193
And I promise I
will from now on.

42:48.318 --> 42:53.198
The first thing that I find
out you'll find out, OK?

42:53.323 --> 42:55.033
 OK, dad.

42:55.158 --> 42:59.287
 I'm just not going to keep
anybody in the dark anymore.

42:59.412 --> 43:02.791
But I'm feeling better.

43:02.916 --> 43:06.294
So I can be
cautiously optimistic,

43:06.419 --> 43:09.714
that's what Dr. Virani told me.

43:09.839 --> 43:10.799
So that's a good thing.

43:13.385 --> 43:16.471
We all need a little
optimism right now, huh?

43:16.596 --> 43:17.430
 We love you.

43:17.555 --> 43:18.556
 I love you.

43:18.682 --> 43:20.600
I love you both so much.

43:20.725 --> 43:22.769
OK, let's take this thing home.

43:22.894 --> 43:24.187
Look at Jack.

43:24.312 --> 43:25.689
[laughter]

43:25.814 --> 43:30.777
(SINGING) I must
break from this spell.

43:30.902 --> 43:32.987
This is where the
light comes in.

43:37.158 --> 43:37.992
Oh!

43:42.539 --> 43:44.833
Where the light comes in.

43:44.958 --> 43:48.294
I must break from this spell.

43:48.420 --> 43:52.424
Tear this blindfold
to the ground.

43:52.549 --> 43:55.844
I must break from this spell.

43:55.969 --> 43:58.972
Tear this blindfold
to the ground.

44:01.933 --> 44:05.353
This is where the
light comes in.
