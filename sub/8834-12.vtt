01:08.041 --> 01:08.875
There.

01:08.959 --> 01:13.458
No, no, no.
There is no "ick" in spinach, Kit.

01:13.542 --> 01:17.792
[laughs]
You want to bet? Taste it. Ick!

01:17.875 --> 01:20.917
-Spell it correctly, please.
-[kids laughing]

01:21.000 --> 01:25.500
[sighs] I don't even like to eat it,
let alone spell it.

01:26.291 --> 01:31.750
And finally on my two zillionth try,
I spelled it right.

01:31.834 --> 01:34.750
[groans] My aching hand!

01:34.834 --> 01:37.667
You know, even back when I was in school,

01:37.750 --> 01:40.166
they made a big deal out of spelling.

01:40.250 --> 01:41.959
-[door opens]
-So much for progress.

01:42.041 --> 01:43.583
-[door closes]
-From where I sit,

01:43.667 --> 01:45.500
spelling's like playing darts,

01:45.583 --> 01:47.583
close is good enough.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.166
What do you mean, Baloo?

01:49.250 --> 01:52.709
Well, supposin' I spelled cat, c-a-t.

01:52.792 --> 01:55.208
You'd know
what I was talking about, right?

01:55.291 --> 01:58.458
Boy, but cat is spelled c-a-t.

01:58.542 --> 02:02.709
Like I said, just like darts
sometimes you get lucky.

02:02.792 --> 02:05.542
Baloo, don't fill Kit's head with drivel.

02:05.625 --> 02:09.959
Proper spelling brings respect,
self-esteem, and most of all, money.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.792
Money? How's that?

02:11.875 --> 02:15.000
Because we're going into
the skywriting business.

02:15.083 --> 02:18.834
Skywriting is the way of the future,
and I intend to lead the way.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.917
Oh, Becky, skywriting's not only
a waste of a good plane,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.041
-it'll never catch on.
-[door opens]

02:24.125 --> 02:27.542
Pardon me.
I saw your ad outside.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.500
I need some skywriting done today.

02:34.709 --> 02:39.458
Ah, what a silly way to spend a day.
Skywriting, "Happy birthday to you."

02:40.125 --> 02:43.083
Ah, let's see, we start with "H."

02:44.125 --> 02:45.250
Uh-oh.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.041
Are you sure you can
write the message without that note?

02:49.125 --> 02:53.959
Don't sweat it.
Any idiot can spell happy birthday.

03:04.041 --> 03:07.750
Any idiot can spell happy birthday!

03:07.834 --> 03:10.417
Now, Becky, it's the thought that counts.

03:10.959 --> 03:12.333
Thanks to your spelling,

03:12.417 --> 03:14.667
-we'll never get another customer.
-[door opens]

03:14.750 --> 03:16.917
My name is Weazel.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.667
I have an important message
for you to skywrite.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.333
We'd be glad to.

03:22.792 --> 03:26.834
At precisely noon today,
you must write this.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.917
"Chicken soup?"

03:29.000 --> 03:30.917
What's so important about chicken soup?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.166
[stuttering]
It's to let my wife know

03:34.250 --> 03:38.208
what I want for supper. [chuckles]
Yeah.

03:38.291 --> 03:41.125
Yes, well, I'm sure that is important.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.583
-We'll be on top of it, Mr. Weasel.
-That's Weazel.

03:50.709 --> 03:54.208
Becky, that guy's as shifty
as a ten-speed clutch.

03:54.291 --> 03:58.208
Well, as long as his money's green,
who are we to judge?

03:58.291 --> 04:02.125
Now, get it right this time.
"Chicken soup."

04:02.208 --> 04:04.959
I got you.
Hunky-dory.

04:09.709 --> 04:13.291
[Kit] Ah, Baloo, isn't there
a "U" in "chicken soup?"

04:13.375 --> 04:16.333
[Baloo] Yeah, and there's a whole alphabet
in alphabet soup.

04:16.416 --> 04:20.916
-But what if you're spelling it wrong?
-Hey, I'm a pilot, not a poet.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.917
[alarm ringing]

04:26.500 --> 04:30.709
-Look, the message.
-Who spells chicken soup with two "O's?"

04:30.792 --> 04:32.875
Who cares? According to the code,

04:32.959 --> 04:35.667
it's the second letter
of the first word that's important.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.333
That would be the letter "H."

04:38.417 --> 04:41.166
It's the code to begin phase one.

04:41.250 --> 04:45.333
[clears throat] "Drop everything.
Report to launch sites."

04:45.417 --> 04:46.750
Let's go!

04:47.000 --> 04:50.583
[man] You're looking at
the 14-karat genius, Weasel.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.166
That's, uh, Weazel.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.542
Whatever. Who else but I,
Heimlich Menudo,

04:55.625 --> 04:58.417
could've organized all the crooks
of Cape Suzette

04:58.500 --> 05:03.792
into one crime syndicate
to pull off the Heimlich Maneuver?

05:03.875 --> 05:06.834
Only you, Heimlich.

05:06.917 --> 05:11.291
Ah, this time,
the police can't bug my phones,

05:11.375 --> 05:16.291
or intercept my telegrams,
or capture my carrier pigeons.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.709
And why?
[laughs]

05:18.792 --> 05:22.291
Because I am using a skywriter.

05:23.625 --> 05:27.709
Yeah, but it was I who found
that foolish bear to do our dirty work.

05:28.166 --> 05:31.041
And you shall be rewarded, my son.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.834
Why can't I have a big diamond?

05:45.333 --> 05:49.250
Because they're mine.
Ooh, I love them!

05:49.375 --> 05:52.542
They sparkle, they shine, they...

05:52.625 --> 05:53.834
[gasps]

05:53.917 --> 05:55.208
[choking]

05:56.667 --> 05:59.041
I didn't get the last part.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.375
"I'm cho... king."

06:03.458 --> 06:06.333
Ah! That must be the code
to begin phase two!

06:07.750 --> 06:09.041
[coughs]

06:09.291 --> 06:10.417
You fool!

06:10.667 --> 06:13.333
Didn't you see I couldn't breathe?

06:14.417 --> 06:18.333
Sorry, I was too busy
thinking of your Heimlich Maneuver

06:18.417 --> 06:20.458
to notice that you was choking.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.250
Detective Thursday here.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.041
Request permission to enter headquarters
by the front door.

06:31.583 --> 06:35.625
But... OK, OK.
I'll use the secret entrance.

06:35.709 --> 06:36.667
Over.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.792
-Look, um, a flying bear!
-So?

06:48.875 --> 06:52.291
Um... a flying bear that, uh...
juggles bowling balls.

06:59.333 --> 07:00.625
[grunts]

07:02.709 --> 07:05.417
Morning, Gertalin.
I hate that entrance.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.667
You think you hate it?
How would you like to have my assignment?

07:08.750 --> 07:11.083
Boys, gather around.

07:11.542 --> 07:15.041
Things are too quiet lately.
There hasn't been a major crime in days.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.625
-Uh, but isn't that good news, sir?
-[Detective Thursday] Negative.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.166
It can only mean trouble brewing.

07:20.250 --> 07:25.500
Uh, but, sir, our contacts in the field
would've gotten wind of a big operation.

07:25.583 --> 07:29.959
Unless the crooks are getting their orders
through unusual channels.

07:30.041 --> 07:33.291
We may be up against
a brilliant criminal mind.

07:33.417 --> 07:36.500
Brilliant, Baloo.
Really brilliant.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.166
What were two "O's"
doing in "chicken soup"?

07:39.250 --> 07:40.500
Uh, the backstroke?

07:40.583 --> 07:43.792
Not funny.
You're jeopardizing my business.

07:43.875 --> 07:47.542
Oh, Becky.
We're not getting any complaints, are we?

07:47.625 --> 07:50.041
We're also not getting
any repeat business.

07:52.166 --> 07:56.458
-You were saying?
-Here is your next assignment.

07:56.542 --> 08:01.125
At precisely 3:00, write, "Eat at Joe's."

08:01.208 --> 08:05.458
-Taking the missus out to dinner, huh?
-Yeah, yeah, that's it.

08:05.542 --> 08:07.291
Well, how about if I write,

08:07.375 --> 08:09.875
"Dinner at the diner,
nothing could be finer."

08:09.959 --> 08:13.750
No! Joe's!
"Eat at Joe's!"

08:13.834 --> 08:17.542
-But Joe went out of business last week.
-Well, who cares?

08:17.625 --> 08:21.625
-Well, your wife might.
-[mutters] I don't have a wife!

08:21.709 --> 08:25.125
Just write the message and get it right...
[mutters]

08:26.750 --> 08:28.875
Sheesh. Testy little weasel.

08:28.959 --> 08:33.125
-[Weazel] That's Weazel!
-I better apologize.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.500
Oops. Look what he dropped.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.833
"Eat at Joe's."

08:41.917 --> 08:44.959
Here, Baloo, Miss Cunningham
says you got to get this one right.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.208
Oh, not again.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.375
What are you gonna do now?

08:50.375 --> 08:54.709
[Baloo] Don't worry, kiddo.
If there's one thing I know, it's eating.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.458
[Gertalin] Any progress on the case, sir?

08:57.542 --> 09:01.083
Negative. Even our snitches can't
figure out what the crooks are up to

09:01.166 --> 09:02.875
-or they're passing their information.
-[airplane overhead]

09:03.291 --> 09:07.834
That's strange.
In the sky... that plane, that message.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.542
[Gertalin] Uh,
it's spelled kind of funny, isn't it?

09:10.625 --> 09:12.291
That's not the only thing that's funny.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.834
Joe went out of business last week.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.875
Maybe it's a message.
A code!

09:17.959 --> 09:20.125
Track down that plane.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.083
There's the next message.

09:22.166 --> 09:25.750
Would you look at
how that guy spelled "Joe's." [laughs]

09:25.834 --> 09:28.583
It's the second letter that's important.

09:28.667 --> 09:29.583
According to the code,

09:29.667 --> 09:33.917
we launch the Heimlich Maneuver
in exactly two hours. Come on.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.333
It's just a crime
the way they've lowered

09:36.417 --> 09:39.083
the academical standards
in this business.

09:47.083 --> 09:50.083
I'm telling you, Baloo,
the way you spell is a crime!

09:50.166 --> 09:53.834
Give me a break, Beckers, you're making
a federal case out of nothing.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.125
Are you the skywriting pilot?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.500
-Yup. Sure am.
-You're under arrest.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.667
Hey, hold on!

10:01.750 --> 10:06.291
You mean, bad spelling really is a crime?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.250
[siren blaring]

10:10.333 --> 10:13.375
Oh, please, detective.
I didn't do anything wrong.

10:13.458 --> 10:14.542
Put a sock in it, mister.

10:14.625 --> 10:18.542
A laundromat's no place
to air your dirty laundry. Uh-oh.

10:21.375 --> 10:24.625
Look!
There's that flying bear that juggles!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.208
And, uh, chews gum at the same time!

10:27.291 --> 10:30.291
Wait for a dryer like everyone else.

10:30.375 --> 10:33.834
This dryer is a deputized member
of the law enforcement community.

10:33.917 --> 10:36.208
-Now kindly back off, madam.
-[clattering]

10:36.291 --> 10:38.834
All right, we're going for a spin.

10:43.917 --> 10:46.333
I want the truth
about those sky-written messages.

10:46.417 --> 10:49.667
-Talk.
-All right. OK, I confess.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.166
-I'm the one you're looking for.
-I knew it.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.083
-How long has this been going on?
-Since third grade.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.583
My teacher said I'd be sorry someday.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.500
Started on the road to ruin young, hey?

10:59.583 --> 11:02.333
And five will get you ten,
you're not in this alone.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.875
-Who are you working for?
-Miss Cunningham.

11:04.959 --> 11:07.083
Skywriting was her idea.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.125
So, you're the brains
behind this operation?

11:10.208 --> 11:11.750
[Baloo]
But she's innocent, detective.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.542
It's my fault those messages
were spelled wrong.

11:14.625 --> 11:17.542
Who said anything about spelling?
Was that part of your code?

11:17.625 --> 11:21.166
What code? I thought I was here
because of lousy spelling.

11:21.250 --> 11:24.458
-Don't try to throw us off.
-He's telling the truth, detective.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.583
He is a lousy speller.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.041
If you don't believe it,
give him a spelling test.

11:28.125 --> 11:31.917
OK, wise guy.
Now you're in for it.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.041
[beeping]

11:46.875 --> 11:49.583
It's time to launch the Heimlich Maneuver.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.583
[Baloo] Stop! Please!
I can't take it anymore!

12:19.667 --> 12:22.875
Now, spell pizza.

12:23.625 --> 12:27.458
Pizza. Uh, uh...
"P-E-E..." Uh...

12:27.542 --> 12:30.500
Just give me a hint?
Does it have one "T" or two?

12:30.583 --> 12:34.583
-Now do you believe he can't spell?
-Ah, it doesn't prove a thing.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.959
-He could be faking.
-[door opens]

12:36.041 --> 12:37.375
-[Kit] I'm here, Baloo.
-[door closes]

12:37.458 --> 12:39.625
With the report cards you wanted.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.750
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Pathetic.

12:43.834 --> 12:46.250
I've never seen
such awful grades in my life.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.875
Hey, I passed recess with flying colors.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.291
Look, I proved I'm a lousy speller.
Now, what more do you want?

12:54.375 --> 12:57.667
All I did was write
a few messages for Mr. Weasel.

12:57.750 --> 13:01.875
You know Weasel?
Sneaky-looking guy in a bad suit?

13:01.959 --> 13:06.000
-One of this town's biggest gangsters?
-Yeah, yeah, and I can prove that, too.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.542
He dropped this.

13:09.083 --> 13:12.041
Why, this is a book of secret codes.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.625
Detective, I promise,

13:13.709 --> 13:17.500
the next time Weasel shows up to give us
a skywriting assignment, we'll refuse.

13:17.583 --> 13:21.250
Negative. Now we've got his code book.
I want you to play along.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.458
You're working for us now, Baloo.

13:27.709 --> 13:32.625
Hey, I don't remember the pilot's almanac
saying anything about an eclipse.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.166
That's no eclipse. Look.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.500
[Heimlich]
<i>Now hear this!</i>

13:41.583 --> 13:44.125
<i>I am holding Cape Suzette hostage.</i>

13:44.208 --> 13:47.125
[laughs]
Every diamond in Cape Suzette

13:47.208 --> 13:50.667
is to be delivered
to my tanker in the harbor.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.333
[chuckles]

13:52.417 --> 13:55.041
<i>And if this demand isn't met,</i>

13:55.125 --> 13:59.625
<i>Cape Suzette will be bombed</i>
<i>by my fleet of blimps.</i>

14:00.166 --> 14:03.041
My boys will blast those led zeppelins
to kingdom come.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.792
[Heimlich] <i>Oh, by the way,</i>
<i>my blimps are filled</i>

14:05.875 --> 14:11.291
with an explosive hydrogen gas.
Any attempt to shoot them down

14:11.375 --> 14:16.417
will result in the complete destruction
of Cape Suzette!

14:16.500 --> 14:17.875
[laughs]

14:25.875 --> 14:27.625
Wow, think of it.

14:27.709 --> 14:31.250
I will soon possess
every diamond in Cape Suzette.

14:31.333 --> 14:36.291
It's been my lifelong dream
to build a mansion of diamonds,

14:36.375 --> 14:39.834
with a swimming pool
overflowing with diamonds.

14:39.917 --> 14:42.583
The ice box will be made of diamonds.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.959
The toaster will be made of diamonds.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.834
-[ringing]
-The telephone.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.709
Yes, the telephone
will be made of diamonds.

14:49.792 --> 14:52.125
No, I mean, the telephone is ringing.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.458
Hello?

15:02.834 --> 15:05.625
[yelling]

15:05.709 --> 15:06.667
Good news?

15:06.750 --> 15:08.583
The police... [groans]

15:08.667 --> 15:12.917
They have told everyone to stay indoors
and refuse my demands.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.166
Aww, how terrible for you.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.166
And the worse for them.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.750
Take this to that stupid bear.

15:20.834 --> 15:24.333
It is the code for
an all-out attack on Cape Suzette.

15:25.166 --> 15:30.000
They will rue the day
that they scorned Heimlich Menudo!

15:45.667 --> 15:49.041
Hey, Weasel, old buddy,
good to see you.

15:49.125 --> 15:54.208
For the last time,
and I do mean the last, that's Weazel!

15:55.166 --> 15:59.125
Here is the last message
you'll ever need to skywrite.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.417
"Wait until dark."

16:00.500 --> 16:04.709
OK. But if I write it after dark,
it'll be kinda hard to read.

16:04.792 --> 16:09.792
No, you fool.
The message is, "Wait until dark."

16:09.875 --> 16:12.041
-Oh.
-So long.

16:12.125 --> 16:15.417
It's been unpleasant knowing you.

16:18.959 --> 16:20.583
Nice sting operation, Baloo.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.959
He just gave you the code
to blow up Cape Suzette.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.959
He what? Hey, paying customer or not,
I ain't gonna do it!

16:29.041 --> 16:33.333
-Of course you're not, Baloo.
-Here's the new substitute message.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.625
"Weight until dark."

16:37.709 --> 16:39.709
You must be slipping, Thursday,

16:39.792 --> 16:41.709
that's the same message
Weasel just gave me.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.959
Negative. You'll notice
it's a different spelling of "wait."

16:45.041 --> 16:46.333
So?

16:46.417 --> 16:49.917
This new code will signal the blimps
to scrub their mission.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.667
So, no spelling mistakes this time.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.625
It has to be letter-perfect.

16:55.709 --> 16:56.625
Uh... right.

16:56.709 --> 17:01.208
And maintain radio silence.
The crooks may be listening in.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.834
And just to make sure
you don't lose this message,

17:03.917 --> 17:08.666
I'm going to staple, glue, tape,
and pin it to you.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.666
[yells]
You don't have to tattoo it!

17:19.834 --> 17:22.083
Uh, what's the code again, Baloo?

17:22.916 --> 17:26.165
Uh-oh, from where I sit it's upside-down.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.000
I'll have to take my shirt off
so I can read it right.

17:29.542 --> 17:33.041
Oh, no! Gone with the wind again.

17:33.125 --> 17:37.917
-Do you remember the code?
-Keep calm. I know it's in here somewhere.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.375
I got it.
"Weight until dark!"

17:46.458 --> 17:48.625
And I know how to spell "weight."

17:48.875 --> 17:50.542
Get ready to skywrite.

17:54.792 --> 17:55.917
-Wait.
-Check.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.542
Skywrite, "Wait."

17:57.625 --> 18:00.500
No, no, wait on the wait.
It's the other kinda wait.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.750
The how much does it weigh kinda weight.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.291
Oh, so, how do we spell it?

18:05.375 --> 18:08.542
You mean, you don't know,
even with all your studying?

18:08.625 --> 18:12.417
What studying?
You said spelling wasn't important,

18:12.500 --> 18:14.917
so I didn't do my homework.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.041
[gulps]

18:16.125 --> 18:18.875
OK, well, um... Let's see.

18:18.959 --> 18:22.083
It's one of those funny words
with goofy letters.

18:22.166 --> 18:28.166
It's either "I-E,"
"E-I..." "E-I..." "E-I, E-I-O."

18:28.250 --> 18:29.333
<i>♪ With an oink, oink here ♪</i>

18:29.417 --> 18:30.709
<i>♪ And an oink, oink there ♪</i>

18:30.792 --> 18:32.583
<i>♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪</i>

18:32.667 --> 18:34.166
<i>♪ E-I, E-I-O ♪</i>

18:34.250 --> 18:39.417
Baloo! Wait a sec, there was
a little poem we learned in school.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.000
"I" before "E," except after "C."

18:42.417 --> 18:45.208
Then man your vowels and let's spell!

18:51.792 --> 18:56.542
There's our instructions.
Check the code book for letter "I."

18:56.625 --> 18:58.583
He put the "I" first.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.583
He's giving the code to attack city hall!

19:01.667 --> 19:03.750
How could he get it wrong?

19:08.291 --> 19:10.750
OK, orders are orders.

19:10.834 --> 19:13.291
Who said you can't fight city hall?

19:14.709 --> 19:18.792
Whoa! I never gave the order
to attack city hall.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.917
[Kit] Uh-oh.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.208
-[Baloo] What's the matter?
-I just remembered the rest of the rhyme.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.542
"'I' before 'E,' except after 'C,'

19:29.625 --> 19:33.166
and when sounding like 'A,'
as in neighbor or weigh."

19:34.417 --> 19:39.041
We gotta make those letters go
return to sender, and fast! But how?

19:40.500 --> 19:41.375
Here's how.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.166
Ready to deploy the explosive device.

19:59.250 --> 20:03.083
Wait!
The "wieght" is changing.

20:03.333 --> 20:07.041
Come on, Baloo, for once in your life,
spell something right.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.667
[Baloo] Let's see if this spelling
carries some weight.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.333
What do we do now?

20:11.417 --> 20:15.959
"Head for the ocean,
drop off bombs, and deflate."

20:16.041 --> 20:20.375
Boy, this Heimlich Maneuver
is one nutty operation.

20:21.250 --> 20:24.500
Oh, we've been double-crossed, Weasel!

20:24.583 --> 20:28.583
Quick, prepare my diamond-tipped
rotor scooter for liftoff.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.959
Not until you call me by my right name.

20:32.375 --> 20:36.125
Oh, Weazel, Weazel, Weazel!
There, are you satisfied?

20:36.208 --> 20:38.291
Most assuredly.

20:43.792 --> 20:46.250
Go back, you fools!
Go back!

21:01.458 --> 21:04.542
[sighs]
I can't believe Baloo did something right.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.542
Let's take her home, Kit. We--

21:14.625 --> 21:15.917
-[crashing]
-Whoa!

21:17.542 --> 21:20.208
They may have ruined my Heimlich Maneuver,

21:20.291 --> 21:23.834
but... [chuckles]
the joke is on you.

21:23.917 --> 21:27.291
Baloo, he's going to
plow right through us!

21:27.375 --> 21:30.500
Maybe not, Kit.
I think I know how to spell relief.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.291
Here's mud in your eye!

21:33.041 --> 21:35.125
[both coughing]

21:39.792 --> 21:42.834
[coughs]
We've got to land this thing!

21:46.792 --> 21:49.375
First-rate work, Baloo.
Exemplary.

21:52.583 --> 21:53.417
[siren wails]

21:53.500 --> 21:57.875
I didn't think you had it in you, Baloo.
Your spelling saved Cape Suzette.

21:58.333 --> 22:03.250
Well, Beckers, it just goes to show,
it pays to know your ABDs.

22:03.333 --> 22:07.792
-Now, Kit and I have work to do.
-What kind of work?

22:07.875 --> 22:13.959
Homework. When it comes to spelling,
close is not good enough.
