00:34.840 --> 00:37.080
Betty Ann! Kiki!

00:37.080 --> 00:39.160
You guys!

00:48.560 --> 00:50.440
What's taking
you guys so long?

00:50.440 --> 00:52.120
I thought
I'd lost you.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.280
How can you walk so fast
in this heat?

00:55.280 --> 00:56.760
Yeah. We're dying.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.840
Come on. We're
almost there.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.000
I'm not sure sitting
by a roaring fire

01:09.000 --> 01:12.960
is the best way to spend the
hottest night of the year.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.040
I say we rename it
"the Heat Wave Society"

01:16.040 --> 01:18.840
and tell the story
by my uncle's pool.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.320
<i>Come on.
It's not that hot.</i>

01:23.360 --> 01:26.120
How can you say that?

01:26.120 --> 01:31.000
<i>How could she say that?
How could she wear that?</i>

01:31.000 --> 01:32.880
You still have
your jacket on?

01:32.880 --> 01:36.120
By the end of my story,
you'll be wearing yours, too.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.200
'Cause I got
a sure way...

01:42.200 --> 01:44.920
To beat the heat...

01:46.240 --> 01:49.200
A story that's guaranteed
to give everyone

01:49.200 --> 01:51.640
a massive case
of the shivers.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.640
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society...

02:02.640 --> 02:04.720
I call this story...

02:13.720 --> 02:15.320
It all began when

02:15.320 --> 02:16.840
Charles Pemberton Shelley III

02:16.840 --> 02:18.880
was sent with his baby-sitter

02:18.880 --> 02:20.920
to spend a weekend
with his aunts

02:20.920 --> 02:24.480
so his parents could
go to a wedding out of town.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.000
It was the coldest winter

02:34.000 --> 02:36.280
anyone could remember
in 100 years.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.160
Aren't you hot
with all that stuff on?

02:39.160 --> 02:41.000
It's 90 degrees
in here.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.680
I'm not allowed
to catch a cold.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.520
[Kristen] Daphne had
been putting up with--

02:46.520 --> 02:49.520
I mean, baby-sitting Charles
since she was 12,

02:49.520 --> 02:52.560
so she knew what she was
getting into.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.200
Are we here?

03:21.840 --> 03:25.000
Yep. This is it.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.520
Whoa. Spooksville
or what?

03:41.520 --> 03:42.960
What's
the holdup?

03:42.960 --> 03:45.280
[Chauffeur] Doesn't
look like anyone's home.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.560
[Charles]
Yeah.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.800
I don't think
this is the place.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.120
How do you know?
You've never met them.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.200
Come on.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.160
Now what's the problem?

04:02.160 --> 04:03.640
What if
they're asleep?

04:03.640 --> 04:07.040
What if they get mad
at us for waking them up

04:07.040 --> 04:09.680
and don't like us and
they're mean all week?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.200
They're your relatives,

04:11.200 --> 04:13.440
not a couple of
wicked old witches.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.960
I hope.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.959
[Creaking]

05:03.080 --> 05:04.720
Little Charlie?

05:04.720 --> 05:06.960
Is that our
little Charlie?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.520
I don't
believe it!

05:08.520 --> 05:11.200
We haven't seen you
since you were a baby.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.720
How you've grown!

05:12.720 --> 05:14.360
This must be the
baby-sitter Debbie.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.600
Daphne.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.120
Oh. So sorry.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.080
But you're right, so
please, do come in.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.560
Come. Come along, Charlie.
Oh, my goodness.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.560
Oh, Charlie.
Ha ha ha!

05:48.880 --> 05:50.360
Come along,
dear.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.680
Young man,

05:51.680 --> 05:53.840
you must be exhausted
from the drive.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.840
Why don't you let us
make you a cup of tea?

05:57.840 --> 06:00.360
Thanks, but I'd better
be going.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.800
Thanks for
the invitation.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.560
Shame he had to
run off.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.280
Well, they never do
stay long anyway.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.800
The main thing is,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.280
we have our little
Charlie with us.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.520
Let us give you the grand
tour of our humble abode.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.960
[Daphne] Let me
help you with that.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.480
Nonsense!
You are our guests.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.680
That's right.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.120
We want you to be
absolutely comfortable.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.640
[Daphne]
I'm sure we will be.

06:41.640 --> 06:46.480
No, no. We're only
trying to be good hosts.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.320
Maylene...

06:48.320 --> 06:51.800
I thought we agreed
not to mention that.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.960
Gretta, dear,
I only said hosts,

06:54.960 --> 06:56.920
<i>not ghosts.</i>

06:56.920 --> 06:58.880
Ghosts?

06:58.880 --> 07:02.720
Silly me. My hearing isn't
what it used to be.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.960
Ghosts?

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
Your aunts
are totally neat.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.360
What?

07:19.360 --> 07:22.200
They're
kind of... weird.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.400
Why? Because their house isn't
new and perfect like yours?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.240
We can't all be
Richie Rich.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.920
Don't. You'll get it
wrinkly.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.120
Fine. Do it yourself if
you're going to be picky.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.080
Mom said I have to
take care of my things.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.640
Whatever. I'll draw
your bath, sire.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.480
<i>[Boy's voice]
I'm cold.</i>

07:48.320 --> 07:50.320
Daphne, wait!

07:51.800 --> 07:53.000
Did you hear that?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.880
What?

07:54.880 --> 07:57.640
A voice from outside.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.200
The wind, Charles.
You heard the wind.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.920
Now get a move on, or
you'll be late for supper.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.760
[Squeaking]

08:41.240 --> 08:43.919
[Voices whispering]

08:52.120 --> 08:53.520
Who's there?

08:53.520 --> 08:55.600
[Voices whispering]

09:03.040 --> 09:05.680
[Daphne] A wood stove!
How totally great.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.960
This old thing never quite
worked right, I'm afraid.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.480
We're only using it

09:15.480 --> 09:16.960
because
the electric range

09:16.960 --> 09:18.760
doesn't work when
the power's out.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.760
Why is the power out?

09:20.760 --> 09:23.160
Oh, it's that old
electric company.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.640
They get all uppity

09:24.640 --> 09:27.480
when a person's just a wee
bit late with the payment.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.000
Gretta, dear, it's
been three months.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.560
Hush, Maylene.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.560
Remember what Father
always said--

09:33.560 --> 09:35.560
"keep your finances
to yourself."

09:35.560 --> 09:37.800
If you're having trouble
with money, well,

09:37.800 --> 09:39.920
won't Charles' parents
help you out?

09:39.920 --> 09:43.360
Neither a borrower
nor a lender be.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.200
Did Father say that,
too, Gretta?

09:46.200 --> 09:49.200
Actually, Father would
roll over in his grave

09:49.200 --> 09:52.680
if he heard us even
talking about borrowing money

09:52.680 --> 09:55.040
from the Pemberton
and Shelley side of the family.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.280
Why? It's not like
they're short on cash.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.280
There was
this little feud.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.320
It was
a long time ago.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.840
There was a terrible
falling-out

10:04.840 --> 10:07.200
between Father
and Uncle Charlie.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.120
Uncle Charlie was
Charles' great-grandfather.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.600
He hired a common criminal
to work on the farm.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.600
Uncle Charlie didn't
know he was a criminal

10:15.600 --> 10:16.840
when he hired him!

10:16.840 --> 10:18.360
But Father thought

10:18.360 --> 10:22.000
there was something odd
about him from the start.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.600
Uncle Charlie
wouldn't listen.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.600
Wow. Was he
a murderer?

10:26.600 --> 10:27.880
[Gretta]
Goodness, no.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.440
Far as I know, he
was a bank robber.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.680
What happened?

10:31.680 --> 10:34.120
The police caught him
in the woods out back

10:34.120 --> 10:35.680
and put him on the
train to prison.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.880
End of story.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.480
Gretta, dear, that wasn't
my understanding.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.000
I heard he never
made it to prison.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.320
The train crashed,

10:46.320 --> 10:49.320
and everybody on it
was killed.

10:49.320 --> 10:53.920
They never found the body
of that poor man.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.240
Tea?

11:21.960 --> 11:22.800
Whoops!

11:26.360 --> 11:28.800
I thought we'd
closed that window

11:28.800 --> 11:31.600
after we
let the smoke out.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.520
We did, Sister.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.320
Maybe it doesn't shut
just right.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.200
I'm sure I felt a
distinct chill just now.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.480
[Gretta] It's all
right, children.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.280
We'll see about having
it fixed in the morning.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.880
Walter was
supposed to do it,

11:47.880 --> 11:49.880
but he left
rather suddenly.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.080
Who's Walter?

11:51.080 --> 11:53.120
[Gretta] He was our
old maintenance man.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.640
I'm afraid he got
rather impatient with us.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.880
Because you
couldn't pay him?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.400
Is that why he left?

11:59.400 --> 12:01.840
I thought it was
because of the ghost.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.000
Ghost?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.360
Would you like more
macaroni and cheese?

12:05.360 --> 12:08.240
There's a ghost here?
Is it the bank robber?

12:08.240 --> 12:09.520
Ghost?

12:09.520 --> 12:12.640
I don't think we should
talk about such things.

12:12.640 --> 12:13.880
Why not?

12:13.880 --> 12:15.880
We know how
young imaginations

12:15.880 --> 12:17.720
can take
the simplest things

12:17.720 --> 12:19.200
and build them up
into nightmares.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.680
I'm not afraid of ghosts
and neither is Charles,

12:21.680 --> 12:23.080
are you, Charles?

12:23.080 --> 12:25.280
Ghosts?

12:25.280 --> 12:26.880
Really, dear, it's
better we don't.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.360
I'm going to apologize,

12:28.360 --> 12:31.360
because every time
I talk about this,

12:31.360 --> 12:33.240
strange things happen.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.400
Maylene,
that is enough.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.320
<i> Give that back, kid.</i>

13:01.320 --> 13:03.840
<i> Give that back!</i>

13:03.840 --> 13:05.160
<i> Yah!</i>

13:05.160 --> 13:06.760
Help! Help!

13:29.640 --> 13:32.800
<i> I'm cold.</i>

13:35.080 --> 13:37.760
<i> I'm cold.</i>

13:41.400 --> 13:42.800
<i> I'm cold.</i>

13:47.040 --> 13:49.200
Aah! Aah!

13:57.480 --> 13:58.440
Help!

13:58.440 --> 14:00.920
Tell them I saw it!
I saw it!

14:00.920 --> 14:02.600
Charles, what
are you doing?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.600
The ghost!
I saw the ghost!

14:04.600 --> 14:08.080
It was a boy. It was
outside. It was calling to me.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.760
You had a bad dream. Get out
of my bed and go to sleep.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.240
It wasn't a dream.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.760
I was having a bad dream,
and then I woke up.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.880
The window burst open--
crash! Like that.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.560
Then I looked down,
and I saw him.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.480
You've got to
believe me!

14:25.880 --> 14:26.920
[Door slams]

14:29.280 --> 14:30.680
[Knock knock knock]

14:30.680 --> 14:32.520
Daphne!
Let me in.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.080
[Sigh]

14:47.160 --> 14:48.720
Now, now, children.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.720
It's not nice
to argue.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.720
Why won't you tell Auntie
Gretta what's wrong?

14:53.720 --> 14:55.800
Charles kept me up
all night

14:55.800 --> 14:57.760
because he thinks
he saw a ghost.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.760
He's mad because
I don't believe him.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.680
What's that?
What did you see?

15:01.680 --> 15:03.760
The ghost.
I saw it.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.360
He says
it talked to him.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.560
It did!

15:06.560 --> 15:09.400
Gretta, did you
hear that?

15:09.400 --> 15:12.560
It's never
spoken to us.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.960
You mean,
you've seen it, too?

15:14.960 --> 15:16.560
Now, Daphne--

15:16.560 --> 15:17.560
Debbie.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.400
Daphne.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.840
You mean,
there is a ghost,

15:21.840 --> 15:24.160
and it's not
just a ghost story?

15:24.160 --> 15:26.320
I suppose there's no
use pretending now.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.960
It was Charlie we
were trying to protect,

15:28.960 --> 15:30.440
and he's already
seen it.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.800
Besides, it never
comes in the house,

15:32.800 --> 15:34.680
so there's no
need to worry.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.000
You guys really believe this,
don't you?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.320
[Maylene]
Of course we do.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.080
Cool.
Whose ghost is it?

15:40.080 --> 15:43.120
No one knows
exactly, but--

15:43.120 --> 15:45.120
there was
this little boy

15:45.120 --> 15:46.800
who lived at a
neighboring farm,

15:46.800 --> 15:49.320
and Father said
he used to

15:49.320 --> 15:51.600
come over here
all the time,

15:51.600 --> 15:53.120
sneak around
the house

15:53.120 --> 15:56.120
trying to find where
mother hid the cookies.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.840
What happened to him?

15:57.840 --> 16:00.320
It's very tragic.
No one really knows.

16:00.320 --> 16:05.080
They just found him one day
out in the woodshed,

16:05.080 --> 16:09.000
all curled up like he was
trying to keep warm.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.640
They said he froze
to death, poor thing.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.000
How sad.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.080
Oh! Look at that.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.280
The fire's
gone out again.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.320
And we have
no more wood.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.080
Does that mean we're
going to freeze to death?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.600
No. There's plenty
of wood around.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.880
Tell me where to go.
I'll bring some in.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.280
I was thinking, maybe we
should call Mom and Dad,

16:30.280 --> 16:32.280
and they can come
and get us.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.280
I'm sure their
wedding's over by now.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.280
The ax isn't where
they said it would be.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.280
Ax?

16:37.280 --> 16:39.280
How else do you
chop wood?

16:39.280 --> 16:41.280
I don't know. I've
never chopped wood.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.280
There's a first time
for everything. Come on.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.920
Am I going to get dirty
chopping wood?

16:47.920 --> 16:49.000
Filthy.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.520
This should do the trick.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.599
Hey, this isn't hard
at all.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.200
In fact,
it's kind of fun.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.200
Want to try?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.760
Yeah!

17:13.520 --> 17:16.119
But I'm not allowed
to play with sharp things.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.119
I can't take it anymore.
You are a total wuss.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.520
I am not!

17:20.520 --> 17:22.720
You're always finding an
excuse not to do things.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.760
When are you going
to quit being a freak?

17:24.760 --> 17:26.319
I am not a freak!

17:26.319 --> 17:29.320
If it weren't for me,
you'd be a couch potato,

17:29.320 --> 17:32.320
sitting at home playing
a nice, safe video game

17:32.320 --> 17:33.880
in your nice,
clean clothes.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.640
What's wrong
with clean clothes?

17:35.640 --> 17:37.160
You want to know?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.240
I'll show you what's
wrong with clean clothes.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.160
Uh! Oh!

17:43.160 --> 17:45.400
Oh, look, he's still
alive! What a surprise.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.360
He survived
a little bit of mud.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.560
That's it! I'm telling
my mom you did that.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.280
I'm telling
my mom and dad.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.040
They're going to
get angry at you and--

17:55.040 --> 17:57.000
<i>[boy's voice]
I'm cold.</i>

17:58.960 --> 18:00.680
What was that?

18:02.720 --> 18:04.080
The ghost!
The ghost!

18:04.080 --> 18:06.040
We have to get
back to the house.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.560
Maylene and Gretta said
it won't come inside.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.880
I think it came
from over here.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.800
No--Daphne!
Come back!

18:30.520 --> 18:32.080
Daphne!

18:32.080 --> 18:35.640
Where did you go?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.080
[Wind blowing]

18:37.080 --> 18:38.640
[Footsteps]

18:56.000 --> 18:56.840
Daphne!

18:59.760 --> 19:02.040
<i> I'm cold.</i>

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
Aah!

19:07.640 --> 19:10.480
Daphne, help!

19:14.960 --> 19:16.400
<i> I'm cold.</i>

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
Aah!

19:20.160 --> 19:22.080
[Screaming]

19:26.400 --> 19:27.600
<i> I'm cold.</i>

19:40.760 --> 19:41.760
Aah!

19:43.440 --> 19:44.400
Aah!

19:45.560 --> 19:48.240
Aah! Aah!

19:51.240 --> 19:53.520
Oh. The ghost!
I saw it.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.200
It's following me!

19:55.200 --> 19:56.760
Calm down.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.600
<i> I'm cold.</i>

20:09.480 --> 20:11.240
What does it want?

20:15.720 --> 20:17.680
The log
from my dream.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.680
What?

20:19.680 --> 20:22.120
He was in the log.

20:22.120 --> 20:25.960
The bad guy
pulled off his--

20:25.960 --> 20:28.240
Charles!

20:36.720 --> 20:38.520
I see something.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.040
[Daphne]
What are you doing?

21:20.240 --> 21:22.160
He just wanted
his coat.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.080
We helped him.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.160
Yeah.
We helped him.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.920
What's this?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.680
It must have
fallen out of the jacket.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.760
[Maylene] Whatever
could that be?

21:36.760 --> 21:39.080
Looks like
some kind of key.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.200
I know!

21:44.000 --> 21:45.400
[Gretta]
Why, of course!

21:45.400 --> 21:47.400
It's the latch
for the stovepipe.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.760
That's why it never
worked properly.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.080
We couldn't get the
flue open without it.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.880
[Rattling in stovepipe]

22:04.000 --> 22:05.440
Maylene, Gretta,

22:05.440 --> 22:09.000
I have a feeling your
money troubles are over.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.040
The criminal hid the
gold in the pipe.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.120
And the little boy
saw him

22:23.120 --> 22:24.520
when he was looking
for cookies.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.400
Charles' dream.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.680
Poor kid.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.880
He froze to death
hiding from the criminal,

22:29.880 --> 22:31.280
and no one knew.

22:31.280 --> 22:35.200
I told you
you'd get the shivers.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.360
I declare this meeting

22:45.360 --> 22:49.040
of the Heat Wave Society
closed.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.120
Good night,
everybody.
