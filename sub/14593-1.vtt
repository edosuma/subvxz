01:07.041 --> 01:13.082
People ask me, "Carole, how do you and
Bruce keep the spice in your marriage?"

01:13.250 --> 01:16.665
Well, I tell them
it's really simple.

01:16.791 --> 01:19.749
I'm just the ultimate tease.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.582
Me and Bruce,
we're not that different.

01:23.666 --> 01:25.499
We know what we want

01:25.583 --> 01:28.082
We know how to get it.

01:28.250 --> 01:32.457
Like this promotion he's going for.
We both know he'll win.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.582
And when he does,

01:34.750 --> 01:36.499
the Robertson household

01:36.583 --> 01:41.165
is gonna be one big
happy family again.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.290
I kid you not.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.540
Jimmy!

02:01.583 --> 02:02.749
Whoo-hoo!

02:08.583 --> 02:10.164
What did you just fucking call me?

02:10.250 --> 02:12.540
Just give us your money, mate.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.040
Fucking hurry up!

02:22.291 --> 02:24.790
Fucking...

02:33.166 --> 02:34.665
Scatter.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.665
Scotland.

02:59.791 --> 03:03.665
This nation brought the world
television, the steam engine, golf,

03:03.750 --> 03:08.999
whisky, penicillin and, of
course, the deep fried Mars bar.

03:10.375 --> 03:15.749
It is great being Scottish. We're
such a uniquely successful race.

03:20.958 --> 03:23.582
And as my wife Carole always says,

03:26.166 --> 03:28.415
"There's no place like home."

03:46.000 --> 03:47.999
Nice one. All right, pal?

03:52.291 --> 03:56.207
The games are always,
repeat, always, being played

03:56.291 --> 03:58.290
but nobody plays the games like me,

03:58.375 --> 04:00.499
Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson,

04:00.583 --> 04:03.582
soon to be
Detective Inspector Bruce Robertson.

04:04.083 --> 04:07.665
You just have to be the
best, and I usually am.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.999
Same rules apply.

04:23.791 --> 04:25.665
What the fuck?

04:28.666 --> 04:30.165
Morning.

04:33.916 --> 04:35.374
Right.

04:36.041 --> 04:40.207
Our victim is a Japanese male

04:40.291 --> 04:41.874
in his early 20s... Yes, Peter?

04:42.541 --> 04:44.624
Sorry, boss, just a wee point.

04:44.708 --> 04:48.332
Maybe we shouldn't stigmatise the guy
by calling him a victim.

04:48.416 --> 04:51.499
Poor wee chinky bastard's dead.
Doesn't matter what you call him now.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.957
Care to share the
joke with us, Dougie?

04:54.125 --> 04:56.957
Dougie Gillman
is your average Scottish copper.

04:57.041 --> 05:03.665
Sixty years ago in the glorious fucking
Reich, you'd be turned into handbags!

05:04.166 --> 05:08.707
At 5/1, Gillman poses a serious
challenge to my promotion prospects.

05:08.791 --> 05:12.082
So he, like the others,
will have to be eliminated,

05:12.791 --> 05:16.707
starting with my main rival
for the inspector's job, Peter Inglis.

05:16.791 --> 05:19.624
Inglis is what they
call metrosexual...

05:25.750 --> 05:29.665
but what I call a fucking bufty.
2/1.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.124
There was no positive ID,

05:31.250 --> 05:34.290
but DS Lennox has been
down at the murder scene.

05:34.375 --> 05:38.082
Ray Lennox, the department's
rookie and resident junkie.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.124
I love the chang!

05:41.416 --> 05:44.457
Even though Lennox is more interested
in trying to bang the office secretary

05:44.541 --> 05:48.999
than any kind of career advancement,
he'll still have to be publicly humiliated.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.249
20/1.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.207
Official policy at the moment is...

05:53.708 --> 05:55.124
Yes, Gus?

05:55.375 --> 05:57.124
What is the party line, boss?

05:57.208 --> 06:00.999
Gus Bain, bit of a long shot because
he's not the sharpest tool in the box.

06:01.083 --> 06:04.207
I've got a new toothbrush, miss!

06:04.333 --> 06:08.207
But then, when did a single-figure IQ
hold anybody back in the police force?

06:08.291 --> 06:09.415
7/1.

06:09.583 --> 06:13.207
In accordance with the description
which Detective Drummond

06:13.291 --> 06:14.499
will presently hand out to you.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.457
- Thanks, Bob.
- "Thanks, Bob."

06:17.541 --> 06:19.290
That arse-kissing Amanda Drummond

06:19.375 --> 06:21.540
would suck Toal off right now
if he promoted her.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.415
Not that it would do her
any good, of course,

06:23.500 --> 06:26.957
because some sad wanker from uniform
is gonna impregnate the wee slag

06:27.041 --> 06:31.249
and that'll be her stint at playing Cagney
and fucking Lacey well and truly over.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.790
10/1.

06:32.916 --> 06:36.707
The umbilical cord
that connects the north and south...

06:36.958 --> 06:42.207
Umbilical cord? The last time I looked
it was a tunnel, you fucking clown.

06:42.958 --> 06:46.124
Edinburgh's worst kept secret is
that Chief Inspector Bob Toal here

06:46.208 --> 06:48.124
has ambitions as a screenwriter.

06:50.708 --> 06:53.999
If that lazy, fat fucker spent
less time dreaming about Hollywood

06:54.125 --> 06:57.790
and more time promoting me, then the
streets would be safer for everybody.

06:57.916 --> 07:00.915
And they left him there,
lying like a pile of rubbish.

07:01.041 --> 07:03.415
- Maybe he was rubbish.
- What?

07:03.541 --> 07:05.540
To the assailants, of course.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.332
Aye, that's it. Your docile
chat might impress the boss,

07:08.416 --> 07:10.332
but it doesn't impress
my fucking hangover.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.332
I have got news for
this herd of donkeys.

07:13.416 --> 07:18.040
There is only one horse can win this race and
that horse is Bruce the Stallion Robertson.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.124
Right, crack on with it.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.332
- Quick word, Bruce.
- Yes, boss?

07:24.500 --> 07:29.499
Things are pretty stretched around here
until we get the new DI position filled.

07:29.583 --> 07:34.207
I want you to head up the case. I'll be
around, but I'll be tied up with other stuff.

07:34.291 --> 07:38.832
So, you'll effectively be acting inspector,
without the remuneration of course.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.165
All leave, unfortunately,
will be cancelled,

07:41.250 --> 07:44.749
but it'll stand you
in good stead for the promotion

07:44.833 --> 07:48.082
because you'll have
the other contenders under you.

07:54.916 --> 07:58.707
There's really nothing more seductive
to a woman than power.

07:59.833 --> 08:04.124
So, when Bruce gets his promotion,

08:04.208 --> 08:06.999
I won't be able to
keep my hands off him.

08:08.208 --> 08:11.624
Detective Inspector Robertson.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.790
Even the sound of it
makes me want him right now.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.665
Are you not worried
if you bugger off to Hamburg

08:19.750 --> 08:21.832
it'll go against you for
the promotion then?

08:21.916 --> 08:23.290
- Promotion?
- Aye.

08:23.416 --> 08:25.040
What's the alternative, Ray?

08:25.125 --> 08:29.832
I give up my holidays for some murdered Jap,
kamikaze, sushi-eating, karaoke bastard?

08:29.916 --> 08:31.082
No chance.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.999
Well, you do have a very
understanding wife in Carole, Robbo.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.624
Aye. Aye, that I do.

08:36.416 --> 08:40.414
- I wish I had somebody like that.
- I bet you do, Ray. I bet you do.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.457
Tell you what, we'll have to get you
another threesome organised

08:43.541 --> 08:45.832
with that wee skanky dealer's bird,
won't we? Do you remember that?

08:47.583 --> 08:52.624
Lennox hates to be reminded of the
time we went tag team on that thing.

08:52.708 --> 08:55.290
Have you even started yet, baby cock?

08:57.125 --> 08:59.249
Everybody has got an Achilles' heel

08:59.333 --> 09:02.207
and I make a point
in remembering my associates' ones.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.415
You were like an animal, Ray.

09:07.416 --> 09:10.207
Oh, here we go. Here comes
the schemie wee bastard now.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.374
Jesus Christ, look at the face
on that wee lassie.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.290
That's a stoat-the-baw situation
if ever I saw one.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.207
That's a curvy little
arse, though, mind.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.082
Never you mind the curvy
little arse on it, Ray.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.457
- It's a bit fucking young, no?
- Ah, she's borderline, man. Come on.

09:21.583 --> 09:22.665
- Borderline?
- Aye.

09:22.750 --> 09:25.082
Do you like wee lassies, Ray?
Are you into baldy fanny?

09:25.166 --> 09:26.707
Borderline, is it?

09:26.791 --> 09:29.249
40 sheets at 5/1 . Come on. 5/1?

09:29.333 --> 09:30.999
Ah, no, maybe you're right.
You're right enough, man.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.040
You have got
absolutely no bottle, Ray.

09:34.625 --> 09:38.665
That is exactly why the Lennoxes of this
world will never oust the Robertsons.

09:39.583 --> 09:43.165
I kid you not, my sweet, sweet friend.
Come on!

09:48.041 --> 09:50.082
- Right then, what's the script?
- The Beast routine.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.957
- It's a bit full-on, Robbo, no?
- You steam right in.

09:53.041 --> 09:56.290
It's the only language these
schemies understand, OK? Come here.

09:56.375 --> 10:00.290
I want you to show this bastard who the
hardest firm in this city really is, OK?

10:00.375 --> 10:03.165
Nobody... Nobody steams in
like the Edinburgh polis.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.207
- Go.
- Right.

10:05.291 --> 10:09.374
Wait two seconds. He'll be firing into
her and we'll catch the stoat in action.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.374
- Another toot for good luck?
- I'm on duty.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.290
Aye.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.249
For God's sake, I'm coming!

10:24.375 --> 10:27.374
- Who the fuck are you two?
- Jehovah's fucking Witnesses.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.165
Keep your fucking mouth shut.
You hear me?

10:29.291 --> 10:31.499
You speak when you're
fucking spoken to. You get it?

10:31.583 --> 10:34.082
- I said, do you fucking get it?
- Aye, aye, aye!

10:34.250 --> 10:36.665
- Get the fuck out!
- Oh, a lady.

10:37.541 --> 10:38.582
How old are you then, madam?

10:38.708 --> 10:40.874
My father's a very well
respected lawyer, you know.

10:40.958 --> 10:43.415
What does that make me then?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.999
Very good. How old are we?

10:46.083 --> 10:47.874
- Sixteen.
- ID?

10:50.750 --> 10:51.874
No, you don't.

10:53.583 --> 10:57.040
Please note, female is below
the legal age of consent.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.165
Stephanie Donaldson.

11:03.250 --> 11:06.874
No relation to Conrad Donaldson QC
by any chance, are we?

11:08.333 --> 11:09.540
Bingo.

11:12.291 --> 11:14.290
Imagine what your daddy would say.

11:14.791 --> 11:16.040
Please don't say anything.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.124
What's it worth, Stephanie? A gam?

11:22.500 --> 11:25.207
Can you imagine what his
posh pals would say

11:25.291 --> 11:29.915
if they found out that his wee princess
was riding all the low-life scum

11:30.000 --> 11:33.665
he gets paid fortunes for
to keep out the nick?

11:33.791 --> 11:35.582
Do you want to do that to him?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.624
Fucking hell! Jesus Christ!

11:50.708 --> 11:53.415
Who taught you that technique?
A fucking cheesegrater?

11:53.500 --> 11:56.790
I've got a good mind to tell your daddy now
anyway after that poor excuse of an attempt.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.374
Please, don't.
That's not fucking fair!

12:08.458 --> 12:11.040
- She told me she was 1 8.
- Oh, dearie, dearie me.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.749
It's not the best time to be inside
for riding kids, is it?

12:13.833 --> 12:15.874
I make you right. Still, he's
only gonna do six months.

12:15.958 --> 12:18.415
- Ah, posh fanny, though.
- Fair enough. Two years then.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.415
Problem is, if some law-abiding
officers were to tell a strict

12:21.500 --> 12:23.540
- Freemason screw like Ronnie McArthur...
- Ronnie McArthur.

12:23.625 --> 12:26.290
That the girl in
question was 11 or 10...

12:26.316 --> 12:27.440
Or even eight.

12:27.541 --> 12:29.665
- Hey, come on, now, boys, eh?
- Aye, eight would do it.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.832
Then the poor cunt's life
wouldn't be worth living, would it?

12:31.958 --> 12:33.715
Straight to the Beast's
wing in Saughton nick.

12:33.741 --> 12:34.899
Aye, but hang on a minute.

12:34.958 --> 12:37.124
Suppose this stoat-the-baw
had certain information

12:37.208 --> 12:38.665
that could help the
law-abiding officers.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.207
- With a murder enquiry.
- Ah, fuck sake.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.457
Nah, I'm not a grasser.

12:45.208 --> 12:49.249
Right, see, Ocky, there's this one guy in
the Beast's wing that they call The Beast.

12:49.333 --> 12:53.040
- The Beast?
- No, no, no, no, not the Beast.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.249
- The...
- ...Beast.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.457
Shouldn't really be inside a
normal prison, to be fair.

12:57.625 --> 13:00.040
No, but the last time
he escaped from a mental institution

13:00.166 --> 13:02.665
the local livestock bore
the brunt of his frustrations.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.848
Fucked a Highland cow
to death, so they say.

13:04.874 --> 13:07.065
Tore the horns clean
off the poor bastard.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.749
Ronnie says the only way
they can keep The Beast quiet

13:09.833 --> 13:11.957
is by putting a new model
in his cell every few weeks.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.124
- A model?
- Aye.

13:13.208 --> 13:16.249
That's what Ronnie and all the boys call
the fresh-faced laddies they send him.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.457
- Supposed to be a big fucker as well.
- Fuck off.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.832
You get your fucking hands off him
and you stand up straight.

13:20.958 --> 13:24.415
6'4", full of muscle
and deaf as a post.

13:24.541 --> 13:25.999
What's deaf got to do with it?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.749
Cos he can't hear you
when you're screaming "no".

13:28.833 --> 13:31.832
- Hung like a Derby winner, so Ronnie says.
- Aye.

13:31.958 --> 13:34.540
Splits them all first
time without fail.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.249
One thing's certain, you'd come out of
there with five new arseholes, pal.

13:37.333 --> 13:40.457
That's if you ever do come out
after an experience like that.

13:40.541 --> 13:42.082
So what's it gonna be, Ocky?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.832
- Grass up?
- Or lock up?

13:48.333 --> 13:49.832
There you go, pal.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.124
You stop smoking, OK?

13:53.250 --> 13:55.957
- Yes!
- That's it.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.332
- That's it.
- Oh, yes!

13:59.416 --> 14:01.832
That's it.
Turn off my gas, Carole. Go.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.040
Go. Go! Go!

14:05.125 --> 14:07.624
Oh, yes!

14:24.625 --> 14:26.874
Did you really mean what you said
about falling in love with me?

14:28.125 --> 14:31.040
You're a fucking cow,
do you know that?

14:31.166 --> 14:36.749
We have been turning off the gas for each
other and you are a work mate's missus.

14:36.916 --> 14:39.207
So, do you know what that makes you
in my book?

14:39.291 --> 14:41.707
Do ya?
It makes you a fucking cow.

14:41.833 --> 14:44.415
- Why are you being like this?
- Because... Because, darlin',

14:44.541 --> 14:47.832
you let me in here and
you let me in there.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.124
You don't let me in here.
And that's what love is.

14:53.666 --> 14:56.665
What was all that? What was all that?
What was all that fucking good stuff, eh?

14:56.750 --> 14:58.832
That was all just games, weren't it?
Sad, silly wee games.

14:58.958 --> 15:03.165
A test if you will. A test which you
have sadly and miserably failed.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.040
Why are you saying all this? And why
did you call me by your wife's name?

15:07.166 --> 15:08.665
You said you loved me, not Carole.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.665
I need you to take a good, long, hard think
about what feelings actually are, OK?

15:11.750 --> 15:14.665
Because, if you want me to fix
your head, easy-peasy Japanesey,

15:14.750 --> 15:17.540
but only you... only you can
get in touch with your heart.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.999
- But, Bruce...
- If you want a fucking,

15:19.083 --> 15:21.957
if you want a shagging
and a riding, I'm your man.

15:22.041 --> 15:25.832
However, I've got to inform you, I find
all this just a little bit sordid.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.540
And I can only imagine how much
this would hurt poor old Dougie

15:28.625 --> 15:31.624
if he found out.
In his own fucking bed, Christ!

15:31.750 --> 15:33.624
Bruce, please stay. We need to talk.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.165
No! I am on a murder case here.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.624
That's M-U-R-D-E-R,

15:38.708 --> 15:41.457
which spells S-E-R-I-O-U-S.

15:41.541 --> 15:47.540
So, if I don't get my A-R-S-E in G-E-A-R,
I am in serious S-H-I-T, OK?

15:47.750 --> 15:49.374
You're being so cruel.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.957
Love is cruel, Chrissie.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.582
Love is cruel.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.249
I think she's fucking somebody else
as well, Robbo.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.499
No, no, no, no.

16:01.583 --> 16:06.540
It's killing me because I can't even
prove it. Some detective me, eh?

16:06.625 --> 16:07.749
Listen, listen, listen.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.124
Your Chrissie is about
as loyal as they come.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.832
- Ah, fuck off.
- Come on, now. Come on.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.582
And cheer the fuck up.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.832
You know you're the favourite
for the Chief Inspector position?

16:17.166 --> 16:18.665
You reckon?

16:22.541 --> 16:24.957
Hey, you're lucky. Carole's great.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.374
She's a real beauty as well.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.415
Aye. I'd say you're right on that.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.832
- You two still as happy as ever?
- Couldn't be happier.

16:37.750 --> 16:40.332
- How old's...
- Seven. Stacey's seven.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.457
Stacey, aye.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.540
- Here are the lads.
- Gus.

16:44.708 --> 16:47.165
Thank Christ.
Come on, sheriff's in town. Give us two.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.332
Just the stuff, huh.
That'll do nicely.

16:51.958 --> 16:54.354
And how's that wife
of yours keeping then?

16:54.380 --> 16:56.774
Every day is Valentine's Day.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.457
- And you'd be Cupid, aye?
- I'm the very boy, Robbo.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.332
- Some man, some man.
- I'm the very boy.

17:06.665 --> 17:08.499
Well, I'd better be
going home then, boys.

17:08.583 --> 17:11.040
Right enough.
Take care of yourself then, pal.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.124
What's up with him?

17:19.208 --> 17:21.374
Never got a good word
to say about anybody, that guy.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.332
Who, Dougie Gillman?

17:23.915 --> 17:27.165
Stab you in the back
without even thinking about it.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.332
Catholic, you see.

17:29.541 --> 17:32.195
Saying that, look at
young Ray Lennox there.

17:32.221 --> 17:34.815
He's as Protestant as
you and I, and yet...

17:35.458 --> 17:37.665
Better no' say anything, actually.
He's... Nah.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.749
- Oh, no, go on, Robbo.
- No, he's a good boy, he's a good boy.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.957
Oh, go on. Go on.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.332
Do you see him in here?

17:46.041 --> 17:49.207
I don't even have to look around
and I know that the answer is no.

17:50.416 --> 17:52.457
It's 3/1, he's in
that deviant wine bar

17:52.541 --> 17:55.749
with the lesbian Amanda Drummond,
cooking up all sorts of shenanigans.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.832
Oh, you're an awful man, Robbo.

17:57.958 --> 18:00.957
What do you think the main topic of
conversation between them is gonna be?

18:02.208 --> 18:03.207
You.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.749
Maybe me.

18:06.458 --> 18:09.457
Promotion. That's what, my friend.

18:09.541 --> 18:12.540
You think young Lennox is running with
the hounds and hunting with the hares?

18:12.708 --> 18:14.124
You said it, Gus.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.915
I better keep a beady eye
on that wee bastard.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.582
Don't want him spoiling
the old promotion chances.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.915
Christ, no.

18:54.750 --> 18:58.165
- Come on, come on, come on the Hearts.
- Are you a big fan then, mate?

18:59.041 --> 19:00.457
- I am indeed, pal.
- So am I.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.832
Let me guess, here comes the bit
about you being one as well.

19:02.916 --> 19:05.424
Ever since your granddaddy
took you as a wee laddie.

19:05.450 --> 19:06.774
Blah, blah, pish and shite.

19:09.250 --> 19:12.915
- Job Centre's that way, Santa sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas anyway, pal.

19:13.666 --> 19:15.832
I heard it's gonna be
a cold one, mind you.

19:20.666 --> 19:22.457
Have a nice day.

19:22.625 --> 19:26.207
Oh, 2-1 . You fucking beauty!
Come on.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.749
- Colin! Colin, come on!
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:30.041 --> 19:32.832
- Please help. Somebody, please.
- Out my way, out my way. I'm police.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.832
Hey, what's happening?
Has anybody called an ambulance yet?

19:34.958 --> 19:36.665
- Colin, look at me.
- Has he stopped breathing?

19:36.750 --> 19:39.749
Do something, please. Do something.

19:39.916 --> 19:41.749
Come on, Colin.

19:41.833 --> 19:43.540
Colin. Colin.

19:43.666 --> 19:45.124
Look at me. Come on.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.165
Colin! Colin, come on!

19:47.250 --> 19:48.457
Come on!

19:49.250 --> 19:56.249
Oh, God.

19:56.333 --> 19:59.957
What's happened
to that fucking ambulance then, eh?

20:00.041 --> 20:02.207
- Oh, God!
- Somebody phone an ambulance!

20:11.750 --> 20:14.207
How have you been since
our last consultation, Bruce?

20:14.291 --> 20:15.832
No problems, I presume, eh?

20:18.041 --> 20:19.749
None.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.832
I trust you're still taking
your medication regularly, yes?

20:23.708 --> 20:25.624
Oh, aye.

20:25.750 --> 20:29.957
Well, this should see you through
to your next appointment, yes?

20:31.208 --> 20:33.415
I'll see you in the new year.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.457
Right?

20:35.541 --> 20:38.915
- Merry Christmas to you, Bruce.
- Thank you, Dr Rossi. Thank you.

20:41.916 --> 20:45.874
And Merry Christmas to you, too, eh?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.624
Well, thank you for that, Bruce.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.040
Oh, yes...

21:10.833 --> 21:12.332
Fuck off!

21:19.041 --> 21:20.332
Hello.

21:20.458 --> 21:24.707
Welcome to the Fantastic Shed Show.

21:26.208 --> 21:29.957
My mum's in. If she hears that I'm doing a
TV show out in the garden, she'll go mad.

21:30.041 --> 21:33.249
Cunty Bunty, Cunty Bunty,
how does your big minge grow?

21:36.458 --> 21:38.457
- Hello?
- Hello, Bunty.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.165
It's Frank Sidebottom here.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.749
I've had just about enough of you.

21:43.833 --> 21:48.832
He told us, right, that you have got
a big hairy fanny, though, Bunty.

21:48.958 --> 21:50.957
- You're pathetic!
- That you...

21:51.125 --> 21:53.540
like to take it up the bum, Bunty.

21:53.666 --> 21:55.415
- Who told you that nonsense?
- Eh...

21:55.541 --> 21:57.249
- Are you ready, Little Frank?
- Little Frank.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.058
Who's Little Frank?

21:58.084 --> 21:59.774
I'm not talking any
more, Bunty, I've got...

21:59.833 --> 22:01.707
- Is that you, Mum?
- Oh, it's my mum.

22:01.833 --> 22:06.624
No, I'm not talking to dirty prostitutes
again, Mum. You can't have the phone...

22:11.750 --> 22:13.249
Thank you, brothers.

22:13.333 --> 22:18.707
That concludes the formal part of this
evening's proceedings and our meeting.

22:18.833 --> 22:22.040
Let us now retire for
a moment of harmony.

22:31.291 --> 22:34.457
- What made you join the force, Bruce?
- Police oppression, brother.

22:34.541 --> 22:37.457
I'd witnessed far too many cases of it
in the mining community I grew up in.

22:37.625 --> 22:39.332
And you wanted to stamp it out
from the inside?

22:39.416 --> 22:42.624
- No, I wanted to be a part of it.
- You're a terror, Bruce.

22:43.125 --> 22:46.957
Clifford Blades, a chartered
accountant and therefore a sad wanker.

22:47.041 --> 22:50.082
Bladesey's not only the newest and
most gullible member of this Lodge,

22:50.166 --> 22:51.749
he's also the wealthiest.

22:51.833 --> 22:55.124
Ideal target practice for the games.
Same rules apply.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.457
And that's why the Craft's been so good
for me, Bruce. Everyone's accepted.

22:58.541 --> 23:00.832
Enough of that shite.
Are you getting any at home, Bladesey?

23:01.708 --> 23:04.124
Well, that side of
things hasn't improved.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.249
This crank caller
just won't stop phoning Bunty.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.124
It's affecting her, you know...

23:08.208 --> 23:10.165
Thing about women,
you have to shag them regularly.

23:10.250 --> 23:14.165
You keep them fucked, man,
they will do absolutely anything for you.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.540
Actually, two things.
Well shod, well shagged.

23:16.666 --> 23:18.449
And that's what you do
with your wife, Bruce?

23:18.475 --> 23:19.482
Course it fucking is.

23:19.541 --> 23:23.624
See, these marriage counselling fucking
spastics, they will tell you a load of shite.

23:23.708 --> 23:27.749
The root of any marital problem
is always, always sexual.

23:27.916 --> 23:30.832
If you're no' fucking the woman
you're with, it opens this...

23:30.958 --> 23:32.957
- Vacuum.
- ...vacuum, which sure as fuck

23:33.041 --> 23:34.749
some other cunt is
gonna come and fill,

23:34.833 --> 23:38.832
and fill with several inches of prime
Scottish beef, Brother Blades.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.832
And, you see,
if she's no' doing the same for you,

23:41.333 --> 23:44.915
you go and get it somewhere else,
just like that.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.249
I must say, I'm looking forward
to our little trip to Hamburg.

23:48.333 --> 23:49.624
- Me too, pal.
- Some nice museums.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.040
Prostitutes.

23:52.041 --> 23:53.749
Of all colours, shapes and sizes.

23:55.041 --> 23:57.457
- Sláinte.
- Sláinte.

23:59.708 --> 24:03.332
- Excuse me, Bruce. I have to spend a penny.
- Go for your life, pal. Don't fall in.

24:24.541 --> 24:27.749
- Will it be the usual, Brother Robertson?
- Oh, yes, please, Hector.

24:32.333 --> 24:35.083
I'll see you at my place
on the weekend then.

24:35.109 --> 24:36.065
Okey-dokey.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.457
Fucking pervert.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.457
Ah, on your own tonight then,
Brother Robertson?

24:42.541 --> 24:44.540
No, thankfully not, Brother Toal.

24:44.625 --> 24:47.624
I just popped in to see Clifford Blades.
You've just missed him.

24:47.750 --> 24:51.332
Well, aren't you and Brother Blades
becoming quite the bosom buddies?

24:51.458 --> 24:54.332
- Oh, birds of a feather and all that.
- Talking of Brother Blades,

24:54.416 --> 24:58.624
have those useless clowns from uniform found
this pervert who keeps phoning his wife?

24:58.708 --> 25:01.207
- Regrettably not, sir, no.
- Spastics!

25:01.333 --> 25:02.540
Aye.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.290
Look, would you mind
overseeing it, Bruce?

25:04.375 --> 25:06.749
I wouldn't normally ask
with something so trivial,

25:06.833 --> 25:09.457
but we just can't afford
to be seen to be not taking care

25:09.541 --> 25:14.124
of such a potentially important benefactor
to the lodge as Clifford Blades.

25:15.708 --> 25:18.332
And what's good for the lodge
is good for the polis, eh?

25:18.458 --> 25:22.457
And another little brownie point for
the promotion, Brother Robertson.

25:22.541 --> 25:24.249
Hush-hush, Toal. Hush-hush.

25:24.958 --> 25:29.540
Just you leave Mr and Mrs Blades
in my safe hands, OK, Brother Toal?

25:35.833 --> 25:39.124
How can you just misplace £200?

25:40.458 --> 25:43.332
If I find out there's
another woman involved, Clifford...

25:53.833 --> 25:57.374
This is Bruce, the detective friend
I was telling you about, dear.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.624
Well, well, Clifford!

26:01.708 --> 26:05.540
You never told me you were hiding
such a beautiful specimen.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.124
You are punching above
your weight, champ.

26:07.250 --> 26:11.624
You're the one who's taking Clifford on
this Masons' weekend to Scarborough, right?

26:12.125 --> 26:13.624
Sc...

26:16.541 --> 26:19.457
Aye, I am taking him to Scarborough.

26:20.958 --> 26:22.457
It's a pleasure to meet you, Bunty.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.249
Please, to business.

26:29.458 --> 26:33.124
I understand how unsettling
these prank calls must be to you,

26:33.208 --> 26:34.665
but I would ask you to be brave.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.249
I've dealt with this
kind of scum in the past

26:36.333 --> 26:38.624
and I can tell you,
they're all mouth and no trousers.

26:38.708 --> 26:44.207
However, slamming the phone down on him
is only going to encourage him, OK?

26:44.333 --> 26:47.957
And if I know this guy like I think I
know this guy, he's gonna like that.

26:48.041 --> 26:50.915
So I need you to indulge
him a little bit.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.749
He'll soon come unstuck.

26:53.333 --> 26:56.124
But your uniformed colleague
said not to encourage him.

26:56.208 --> 27:00.165
Oh, aye. No, we tell the younger,
less experienced officers that, aye.

27:00.250 --> 27:01.957
And it usually makes
the depravate stop.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.415
However, if you're wanting
the man caught...

27:04.500 --> 27:07.915
I want him caught all right.
I want that bastard to suffer!

27:09.041 --> 27:10.540
Excellent.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.832
Well, in that case,
I suggest you play along.

27:14.916 --> 27:18.957
Tell him something about yourself.
What you like.

27:20.833 --> 27:25.165
Up the stakes.
Let hunter become hunted.

27:26.833 --> 27:29.749
We'll nail this slimy bastard
for you, Clifford, no danger.

27:29.833 --> 27:32.249
Bunty, we're gonna get him.
I can promise you that.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.540
Now, I want you to look after
that brave, brave woman.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.124
Oh, I will, Bruce, I will.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.430
I can't tell you how
grateful I am, Bruce.

27:38.456 --> 27:40.482
Oh, you just thank
your hubby here.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.624
Low friends in high
places, eh, Bladesey boy?

28:03.458 --> 28:05.249
A quick word, sir?

28:11.541 --> 28:13.999
Bruce. How goes the case?

28:15.041 --> 28:17.415
- Aye, fairly cut and dried actually, Bob.
- Aye.

28:17.791 --> 28:23.457
A well-known, nasty little mob have been
fingered by a willing informant, so it's...

28:23.541 --> 28:24.624
New poster.

28:24.708 --> 28:27.415
Just a case of gathering
the necessary evidence.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.665
- Me and Gus are on surveillance.
- Good.

28:29.750 --> 28:34.540
The political thing has died a death now
and the papers have got bored with it.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.749
A wog's a wog for all that,
eh, Brother Robertson?

28:38.958 --> 28:42.915
- You said it, Brother Toal.
- Your words, not mine.

28:44.250 --> 28:47.332
Right, about my cycling
trip to Germany, sir.

28:47.458 --> 28:51.040
Oh, I can't say I'm pulling handkerchiefs
out of my arse at the prospect

28:51.166 --> 28:53.915
but I suppose a few days
won't put us too far behind.

28:54.041 --> 28:57.124
What does Carole have to say about you
going away so close to Christmas?

28:57.208 --> 29:00.124
Oh, her and Stacey are just looking
forward to their big presents.

29:00.208 --> 29:03.124
I always bring them back something
nice, so there's never any problem.

29:03.208 --> 29:07.124
- You're the boss at home, then, Robbo?
- Man of the fucking house and all that.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.540
Quite. OK...

29:15.250 --> 29:20.040
Just make sure you brief
Amanda Drummond before you go.

29:24.833 --> 29:28.124
Do you really think she's got the balls
to take over the reins in my absence?

29:28.208 --> 29:30.790
Think I'd rather hand temporary control
over to Gus Bain if you don't mind.

29:30.875 --> 29:34.874
It's only for a short while
and she needs the experience anyway.

29:35.958 --> 29:38.124
- Mmm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

29:40.958 --> 29:43.253
How the fuck did she
ever get out of uniform?

29:43.279 --> 29:44.774
By shagging Toal, that's how.

29:44.833 --> 29:46.624
No!

29:46.750 --> 29:48.874
See, every time a woman drops
her trousers, promotion.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.749
Every time a man drops theirs,
disciplinary action.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.165
Where's the equality in that?

29:55.416 --> 29:58.040
Bingo!
There's the fucker we're after.

29:59.208 --> 30:02.832
No, no, just you wait there, Gus, OK?
No point going in mob-handed.

30:02.958 --> 30:04.040
OK.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.082
Wanna buy some flowers.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.249
Can I help you, sir?

30:26.375 --> 30:28.290
How's business?

30:28.375 --> 30:29.790
All right, I suppose.

30:29.916 --> 30:31.540
Really? I just seen a man
leave empty-handed.

30:31.666 --> 30:33.999
- No' have anything in his line, no?
- No.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.249
- Who was he?
- Just some guy after roses.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.499
- I guess he changed his mind.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:40.291 --> 30:43.374
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- No.

30:44.583 --> 30:47.290
No, you don't. No, you fucking don't.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.249
- What have I done wrong?
- Wasting police time,

30:49.333 --> 30:52.207
withholding information and possibly
harbouring a murder suspect.

30:52.291 --> 30:54.374
- That's shite.
- You will fucking cough up

30:54.458 --> 30:58.124
or I swear to God you will be stuffing
cuddly toys in Corton Vale Prison

30:58.250 --> 31:00.957
faster than you can tie
a bunch of fucking daffodils.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.749
Or maybe...

31:02.833 --> 31:07.249
maybe you would rather get
your tulips around my bulbs.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.999
Would you like that?

31:11.083 --> 31:12.790
I think you would.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.999
Look, he's just a guy I
know from the clubs.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.707
He comes in to talk about
music and that is all.

31:18.791 --> 31:22.374
So, are you and your wee boyfriend just a
two-man musical appreciation society then?

31:22.500 --> 31:25.290
- Is that what you're fucking telling me?
- He's not my boyfriend, honest.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.374
I hope not.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.290
For his sake, you fat bastard.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.749
- Watch where you're...
- Sorry.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.790
Hello. Eh...

31:44.875 --> 31:46.207
How are you?

31:47.208 --> 31:50.207
Yeah, I'm just going to
pick the flowers up.

31:51.375 --> 31:54.082
- Oh, what, is the funeral today, aye?
- Yeah.

31:54.208 --> 31:57.874
Right. Was that your wreath?
The one that says "Dad"?

31:58.791 --> 32:00.999
- Yeah.
- Um...

32:03.500 --> 32:05.999
How many kids have you got?

32:06.166 --> 32:08.707
Just one, a wee boy.

32:12.791 --> 32:14.665
You ever lost anyone close?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.374
Mmm-hmm.

32:19.083 --> 32:21.374
Hurts like hell, eh?

32:22.375 --> 32:23.999
Mmm-hmm.

32:27.291 --> 32:29.707
Um...

32:29.791 --> 32:33.082
Listen, I've got to go.
I'm really sorry, I've got to go.

32:52.541 --> 33:00.874
Davie?

33:05.375 --> 33:06.874
Fuck!

33:41.500 --> 33:45.790
Ah, Bruce, I hear you
have a pain, yes?

33:45.958 --> 33:47.582
Oh, a pain indeed, Doctor.

33:47.750 --> 33:51.165
And would this pain be
one of your physical pains, yes?

33:51.291 --> 33:53.207
No, Doctor, my other kind.

33:53.291 --> 33:57.249
Well, the final destination
of the pain recovery train

33:57.375 --> 34:00.165
is self-help via
abstinence, Bruce, eh?

34:00.291 --> 34:03.957
I've already booked my seat in advance.
Super-saver all the same.

34:04.083 --> 34:07.290
No more cocaine and chip suppers
for Bruce, eh?

34:07.375 --> 34:10.123
Oh, those items were previously
favourites of the Detective Sergeant,

34:10.208 --> 34:11.415
of course they were.

34:11.500 --> 34:14.790
And what of this promotion, eh?

34:14.958 --> 34:17.206
A mere formality, I'm sure.

34:17.291 --> 34:20.998
Only champions can
rewrite history, yes?

34:21.166 --> 34:23.915
Yes, I've always believed that
it's the winning that's important,

34:23.940 --> 34:24.815
not the taking part.

34:24.875 --> 34:29.373
Only winners are more attractive
to the opposite sex, Bruce, eh?

34:29.500 --> 34:34.081
Like our successful friend
here, the tapeworm.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.706
Yes?

34:36.791 --> 34:38.206
Who do we trust, Bruce?

34:39.166 --> 34:40.581
Why, no one, of course.

34:41.208 --> 34:45.956
Not your friends, not your family,
not even yourself, Bruce.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.790
Especially not yourself, eh?

34:49.875 --> 34:52.290
Now, about that pain...

34:52.375 --> 34:54.956
Yes!

34:55.083 --> 34:56.873
Come on, big man, you stiffen up.

34:56.958 --> 35:00.790
Come on, big man, you fucking stiffen.
Come on, big man, you fucking stiffen...

35:02.250 --> 35:03.874
Fucking, fucking!

35:05.291 --> 35:07.790
Ugly little fucking slag.

35:13.291 --> 35:16.999
Dirty poofy bastard.

35:33.166 --> 35:36.874
Peter. Peter, have you seen the
graffiti in the men's toilets?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.207
What? No.

35:38.291 --> 35:41.999
Some nasty little bastard
has written something which,

35:42.166 --> 35:44.582
well, let's just say,
questions your sexuality.

35:47.875 --> 35:51.749
Well, there's always something or other.
I don't let it bother me any more, Bruce.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.874
It's silly.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.499
Oh, come on, man. You elected
me your union representative

35:56.666 --> 35:58.249
so I have to let it bother me

35:58.375 --> 36:01.749
and I can't have your character defamed
in this outrageous manner any longer.

36:01.833 --> 36:02.832
I'm going straight to Toal.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.665
No, no, you're all right, Bruce.
I'll just go and clean it off.

36:05.750 --> 36:09.165
Somebody is playing
silly billies here.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.499
- Such a load of bloody nonsense.
- And I just hope...

36:11.666 --> 36:13.707
I just hope

36:13.791 --> 36:16.790
I don't find out who.

36:16.875 --> 36:20.207
Gaffer? Gaffer, I want you to come and see
some more of this disgusting graffiti

36:20.291 --> 36:22.290
that's been written about
poor Peter Inglis.

36:22.375 --> 36:23.499
I don't have time for every...

36:23.583 --> 36:27.290
As fed rep I don't have time
to see a fellow officer humiliated.

36:27.375 --> 36:30.374
Of course. Listen, Robbo...

36:30.500 --> 36:32.582
- Peter isn't...
- What, sir?

36:34.083 --> 36:35.999
You're gonna have to be careful
what you say here, sir.

36:36.166 --> 36:39.665
He isn't like the graffiti says...

36:42.166 --> 36:43.165
Is he?

36:43.291 --> 36:45.207
Whether he is or isn't
is entirely his own business,

36:45.291 --> 36:48.707
but he's being harassed and we
operate a non-discriminatory policy

36:48.791 --> 36:50.290
on the grounds of
sexual orientation.

36:50.750 --> 36:54.374
But he can't be sexually harassed
if he's not really, well...

36:54.458 --> 36:56.499
What, sir?

36:56.666 --> 37:00.790
Gay, I think the fashionable term
for it is these days.

37:00.958 --> 37:03.249
What he gets up to privately
is his own business.

37:03.375 --> 37:07.790
To be honest with you, I don't even know
that much about the chap, but... Oh.

37:07.875 --> 37:11.082
This bullying...
This bullying has to stop.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.499
Did you do her up the arse?

37:18.666 --> 37:22.082
Where else is there?
Pussy's for faggots.

37:24.500 --> 37:28.957
Right, come on, let's go and see what
Gorman and his wee boyfriend are made of.

37:34.291 --> 37:37.207
Everything you need to know about
those guys are in the jars, darling.

37:40.291 --> 37:44.540
- DN-fucking-A, man. Really?
- Jesus Christ.

37:45.250 --> 37:47.249
Maisie, gratitude.

37:54.791 --> 37:57.290
See, this is the wonderful thing
about being polis, Ray.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.332
Doesn't really matter
if everybody hates your guts

37:59.416 --> 38:02.207
as long as they're civil
to your fucking face.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.499
Is that no' right, Maisie?

38:03.583 --> 38:06.999
Same rules apply, darling.
Same rules apply.

38:07.791 --> 38:12.290
See, Maisie here would teach you
things your mother wouldn't.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.290
I only do it for love now, son.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.915
If you change your mind,
this is the boy for the job.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.707
Getting quite the reputation as a
young stallion, aren't you, pal, eh?

38:19.791 --> 38:23.749
Right, we'd better be off-ski.
We've got the Christmas party.

38:23.875 --> 38:26.165
Christ, I never thought I'd see the
day when I left a knocking shop

38:26.291 --> 38:28.790
with more spunk than I came in with.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.790
- Thank you.
- Thanks very much, son.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.707
I tell you, Gus,
this is the only kind of networking

38:36.791 --> 38:38.915
I don't mind doing with
the Indian community.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.457
I do love a good
curry all the same.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.587
Edith and I, we're
actually thinking of going

38:43.613 --> 38:45.399
to Sri Lanka next year
for our holidays.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.665
- I don't know. Show us your tits.
- Show me yours, I'll show you mine.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.082
Party games. Gather round.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.095
I remember when I used
to work in Sydney,

38:59.121 --> 39:02.024
we played this party game
at the crimbo party.

39:02.083 --> 39:03.207
What was that, then?

39:03.291 --> 39:06.665
Oh, no. Listen, there's ladies
present, Karen, so I better not say.

39:06.791 --> 39:09.457
Come on, Robbo, don't start something
you cannot fucking finish, man.

39:10.958 --> 39:13.207
- Come on, Brucie. Come on, Brucie.
- All right.

39:13.291 --> 39:16.749
- Well, come on, pal. Let's go, man.
- OK, then, Raymondo.

39:16.875 --> 39:20.499
What we would do is, all the men
would go to the photocopying room.

39:20.666 --> 39:23.290
One by one, of course.
No offence if that's your thing.

39:23.458 --> 39:27.499
And what we'd do is we would photocopy
an image of our wedding tackle.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.957
Oh, I just knew
what was going on here!

39:33.500 --> 39:36.999
And then one of the sheilas
would pin it to a notice board.

39:37.083 --> 39:41.082
It'd then be up to the lassies to match the
male member with the corresponding owner.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.249
- What a load of bollocks, man.
- Let's do it.

39:43.375 --> 39:45.082
Come on!

40:45.958 --> 40:48.957
Fuck me with that horse's cock.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.790
What?

41:23.291 --> 41:25.790
Here we go, lads, another round.

41:28.166 --> 41:29.374
Who the fuck is that?

41:31.666 --> 41:33.707
Peter. Peter!

41:33.791 --> 41:38.082
I haven't seen you in such a long time,
sweetie. Where have you been hiding?

41:38.750 --> 41:40.499
Brought some friends along, I see.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.832
Who the fuck are you?
Here, I don't know this guy.

41:44.333 --> 41:48.374
Sorry, I didn't realise
it was that kind of scene.

41:48.458 --> 41:51.082
Huh! Peter can be so sensitive.

41:51.208 --> 41:54.540
Ho! I don't fucking know you! OK?

41:54.666 --> 41:56.874
- Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man.
- But I don't know the guy, Ray.

41:57.333 --> 41:58.707
Well, he seems to know you.

41:58.791 --> 42:01.790
You wrote that fucking shite
on the toilet wall, didn't you?

42:01.958 --> 42:05.499
Did I fuck! Probably one of
your fucking boyfriends.

42:08.666 --> 42:12.999
You disgust me.
Get your face off my cock!

42:13.083 --> 42:17.499
Get off me, you fucking cocksucker!

42:18.041 --> 42:19.665
Don't even think about
defending Gillman.

42:19.750 --> 42:21.999
Well, I'm gonna have to consider
my position on that one, Bob.

42:22.083 --> 42:25.374
Bruce, things are bloody difficult for me at
the moment with this murder case nuisance.

42:25.458 --> 42:28.999
On top of that, not only is there
a latent Nazi racist homophobe

42:29.166 --> 42:31.582
but a bloody jessie boy in the hat
for the inspector's post.

42:31.708 --> 42:34.749
Now, listen, are you referring to
Brother Inglis here? Cos if you are...

42:34.875 --> 42:38.082
How can we have someone of his
disposition leading fellow officers?

42:38.250 --> 42:39.874
Policy or no bloody policy,

42:40.000 --> 42:44.499
I won't pretend I don't find the idea
of two men doing it to each other...

42:46.708 --> 42:48.207
totally disgusting.

42:49.416 --> 42:50.874
But that's by the way.

42:50.958 --> 42:52.963
I still don't see what
that's got to do...

42:52.989 --> 42:54.107
Oh, come on, Bruce.

42:54.250 --> 42:57.707
How can you have confidence in a man who is
constantly undressing you with his eyes,

42:57.791 --> 43:00.124
masturbating over images of you?

43:00.208 --> 43:01.707
It'd just be a compromise.

43:01.791 --> 43:04.290
Surely that's a bit caveman, Bob.

43:04.375 --> 43:07.290
In some parts of the country the force
even advertise in the gay press now.

43:07.375 --> 43:09.957
This isn't some parts
of the country.

43:10.083 --> 43:13.290
This is Scotland, by Christ!

43:31.958 --> 43:34.915
Me and Bruce play these
break-up/make-up games,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.832
but it only makes our
hearts grow fonder.

43:38.250 --> 43:42.707
In a sense we're always together,
because nothing...

43:42.791 --> 43:48.165
Space, time, or distance,
can break our delicious communion.

43:53.666 --> 43:57.624
- Here are your drinks, sir.
- Merci, Fräulein, merci.

43:58.500 --> 44:02.207
But heterosexual anal sex
need not imply an attitude of misogyny.

44:02.291 --> 44:07.749
I read in one of Bunty's magazines that 20%
of heterosexual couples enjoy anal sex

44:07.875 --> 44:10.999
- while only 50% of homosexual couples do.
- Whoa, ho, ho.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.999
What, are you saying that half the
fucking poofs walking about down there

44:14.083 --> 44:16.124
don't actually do each other
up the fucking arsehole?

44:16.208 --> 44:18.082
Bruce, I was only telling you
what the article said.

44:18.166 --> 44:21.499
Aye, and I'll tell you something else
about all that fucking rap music, man.

44:21.583 --> 44:24.874
It's all fucking bullshit cos I
read this article, proper, medical.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.790
It says that white women, right,
are 1 0 times more likely

44:27.875 --> 44:29.582
to give blowjobs than black women.

44:29.666 --> 44:30.874
So where does that leave them?

44:30.958 --> 44:34.124
Up the fucking spout without a
blowjob, that's where, pal.

44:34.208 --> 44:36.415
Well, unless it's the white women
who they're referring to

44:36.500 --> 44:38.582
who are actually
performing the fellatio.

44:38.666 --> 44:41.207
Let me tell you something, Bladesey.

44:41.291 --> 44:44.915
Only a white bird who was not
right in the fucking head

44:45.000 --> 44:48.040
would even think about
going with one of them.

44:54.291 --> 44:58.207
It wasn't even a
country until 1 865.

45:00.875 --> 45:06.790
Fish market, the actor Hans Albers
and FC St Pauli football club.

45:06.958 --> 45:10.082
Get into the fucking index
and look up fucking "fanny".

45:10.250 --> 45:13.082
The Reeperbahn, the
red light district.

45:13.250 --> 45:14.790
Need to take a picture
of what a cunt looks like.

45:37.791 --> 45:39.082
Can you put that in a bottle?

45:39.166 --> 45:40.540
No. Don't touch it, Bruce.
You're not allowed to.

45:40.625 --> 45:42.246
You've got to be able to
touch fucking history.

45:42.272 --> 45:43.149
No, you can't, Bruce.

45:43.208 --> 45:45.082
Bruce!

45:45.166 --> 45:48.082
Bruce! Bruce!

45:49.000 --> 45:50.499
Bruce!

46:07.458 --> 46:08.957
Is this a real prostitute?

46:10.208 --> 46:12.499
Arschficken, me and her. 50?

46:12.583 --> 46:15.207
- Arschficken. 50.
- Thanks very much.

46:15.291 --> 46:16.374
Right, Brunhilde.

46:16.458 --> 46:20.207
- My name's Clifford.
- Bladesey, don't go bareback.

46:20.291 --> 46:21.790
I'm a Gemini.

46:23.500 --> 46:24.749
Can I just have a glass of water?

46:24.833 --> 46:28.165
Not at all. I've got something else
in mind for you.

46:29.208 --> 46:32.749
Here, here, here, here, here.
Look at these two. Look at these two.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.957
Fucking bufties. Disgusting.

46:35.083 --> 46:37.249
Absolutely fucking...

46:38.166 --> 46:39.707
disgusting.

46:41.958 --> 46:44.915
I've never seen the
attraction of it myself.

46:45.291 --> 46:46.790
Cheers, pal.

46:46.875 --> 46:48.165
Cheers.

47:10.125 --> 47:14.332
Bladesey, just take your coat off.
You're overheating, man. Just fucking...

47:18.125 --> 47:19.540
Bladesey, I...

47:19.625 --> 47:23.415
I need you to fucking calm yourself.
You're really messing with my fucking trip.

47:23.541 --> 47:24.707
Calm your...

47:24.833 --> 47:28.624
Fucking calm yourself, man.
Calm yourself. Fuck off...

47:28.750 --> 47:31.915
You're on your fucking own, Bladesey.

48:09.333 --> 48:10.332
Fuck off!

48:11.750 --> 48:14.332
Get your fucking hands off me!

48:14.416 --> 48:15.415
Piss off!

48:27.750 --> 48:33.207
Carole.

48:33.291 --> 48:36.124
Carole.

48:36.250 --> 48:39.124
No. Where's Stacey?
Where's Stacey? Where's Stacey?

49:12.125 --> 49:13.624
Hello?

49:13.791 --> 49:16.832
Do you know what time it is, Bruce?
Get into work right now.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.665
Right... Right, I'll be
in in, say, 25 minutes.

49:46.708 --> 49:47.832
You wanted to...

49:49.291 --> 49:50.540
see me?

49:51.000 --> 49:52.540
Take a seat.

49:52.625 --> 49:53.915
As you obviously know, Bruce,

49:54.000 --> 49:58.207
Amanda took a lead role in the murder
investigation in your absence.

49:58.375 --> 50:02.957
I have decided after some deliberation
that this should remain the case.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.124
You have got to be fucking joking me!

50:05.208 --> 50:06.832
- I beg your pardon?
- Are you deaf?

50:06.916 --> 50:09.624
I expect you to give her
your full co-operation.

50:09.708 --> 50:13.582
Since you've been away the media
have taken an interest again.

50:14.041 --> 50:17.874
Press relations is exactly the kind of
area that Amanda here is strong in.

50:18.541 --> 50:23.124
Amanda, can you please brief Bruce
on the latest developments?

50:23.291 --> 50:24.290
Yes, Bob.

50:24.416 --> 50:26.915
Gus has already filled me in,
so there's really no need.

50:27.041 --> 50:28.415
Gus isn't on the ball, Bruce!

50:28.541 --> 50:31.040
OK, then, Mandy, fire away.

50:31.125 --> 50:33.124
We're going to have to bring in
Gorman for questioning.

50:33.875 --> 50:35.957
Not so sure that's a
good idea there, Mandy.

50:36.041 --> 50:40.249
You see, he's a hardened criminal and with
a lawyer like Conrad Donaldson behind him

50:40.333 --> 50:42.124
could go either way.

50:43.375 --> 50:45.124
Nice cycling trip, Bruce?

50:45.208 --> 50:48.415
Enough with the idle banter.
Shall we crack on with the case?

50:48.750 --> 50:52.249
Maybe start by finding this blonde
witness you forgot to tell us about.

50:52.333 --> 50:56.332
These are crafty bastards we're
dealing with. We need hard evidence.

50:57.416 --> 50:58.915
I'll just go and get some, eh?

51:02.416 --> 51:04.624
- Bruce, can I have a word?
- Course you can, sweetheart.

51:04.708 --> 51:07.832
Do you have to refer to me
in that condescending way?

51:07.916 --> 51:10.094
Mandy, you're taking
this far too seriously.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.232
My name is Amanda.

51:11.333 --> 51:14.624
You think you've got a chance of getting
this fucking promotion, don't you?

51:16.416 --> 51:17.415
Bruce.

51:17.541 --> 51:19.124
- Someone here to see you.
- Maybe in a wee min...

51:24.833 --> 51:27.040
We'll continue this later.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.040
Maybe a wee bit of
privacy, eh, Peter?

51:39.416 --> 51:43.290
I came last week,
but they told me you were on holiday.

51:44.791 --> 51:48.124
I wanted to thank you personally
for everything you did for Colin.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.999
Aye. Aye, well, I just wish
I could have done more to help him.

51:55.541 --> 51:57.624
This is the man who tried
to save your daddy.

51:58.500 --> 52:02.249
He helped when the others
just stood back and watched.

52:02.333 --> 52:03.915
He's a fine man, son.

52:05.541 --> 52:08.540
I'd like you to be like
him when you grow up.

52:13.750 --> 52:17.124
They said it was
your favourite team's colours so...

52:18.416 --> 52:20.124
I knitted it especially.

52:21.541 --> 52:23.999
I just wanted to say...

52:26.125 --> 52:27.665
Merry Christmas.

52:32.916 --> 52:34.624
Say bye to the detective, Euan.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.624
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, pal.

52:38.208 --> 52:41.707
Here, here, here... Don't...
Don't go. Um... Just...

52:42.541 --> 52:44.207
This is...

52:44.333 --> 52:46.749
This is just my...

52:46.833 --> 52:49.415
It's my home telephone number.

52:49.541 --> 52:51.124
And my home address.

52:53.125 --> 52:55.457
In case you ever need any help.

52:58.041 --> 52:59.707
For anything.

53:01.416 --> 53:02.999
Thanks.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.415
Do you know what
Drummond says to me?

53:15.541 --> 53:19.499
She tells me that we've got
to bring in Gorman for questioning.

53:21.541 --> 53:24.915
I just laughed in her face
and then I fucked off.

53:25.041 --> 53:26.915
- What do you think of that?
- Aye, nice job, mate.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.040
- Aye.
- Yeah.

53:28.125 --> 53:31.749
These young ones, Ray.
These fucking young ones!

53:34.666 --> 53:36.207
I'll get the drinks in.

53:51.208 --> 53:52.957
Listen, Robbo, I've got
something to tell you.

53:53.833 --> 53:56.999
I don't want you getting the wrong idea and
this is why I'm letting you know first.

53:59.541 --> 54:02.415
Listen, I really want to get on
in the department, right,

54:02.500 --> 54:05.915
but I've not got
enough experience, though, eh?

54:07.541 --> 54:09.207
I don't know, Ray.

54:10.291 --> 54:11.999
All depends on how good
you are, doesn't it?

54:12.916 --> 54:15.207
I mean, I even thought about
applying for the inspector's job.

54:16.250 --> 54:20.624
You know, but I just thought it was a good
idea to get some practice with the...

54:21.541 --> 54:24.457
you know, with the
selection procedures.

54:26.708 --> 54:29.874
- What do you think?
- Cannot do you any harm, pal.

54:31.041 --> 54:33.749
You're right. It can't do any harm,
you know, flying up a kite,

54:33.833 --> 54:35.915
just so they know
who Ray fucking Lennox is, eh?

54:42.416 --> 54:44.915
You need to watch some sly bastards.

54:45.916 --> 54:47.790
- What do you mean?
- I'm just saying

54:47.916 --> 54:51.290
that you need to watch
some sly bastards.

54:52.125 --> 54:53.624
Like who? Who?

54:54.333 --> 54:55.415
Gus.

54:56.291 --> 54:57.707
- Gus Bain?
- Aye.

54:59.125 --> 55:01.124
I mean, he's always been all right
with me, man, you know.

55:01.250 --> 55:04.374
He's been taking quite an interest
in the extracurricular activities

55:04.458 --> 55:06.832
of a certain Ray Lennox.

55:06.916 --> 55:10.040
Just watch what you say
about Bonnie Prince Charlie here

55:10.125 --> 55:12.415
when Gus Bain is around.
Do you understand me?

55:12.541 --> 55:15.832
You know, I would never say anything
about the chang to anybody, you know?

55:16.958 --> 55:19.725
But I will definitely
watch what I fucking say

55:19.751 --> 55:22.399
around that sly old
fucking grasser now, eh?

55:22.625 --> 55:24.624
You cannot fucking trust
anybody any more, can you?

55:35.625 --> 55:39.749
I must look divine, especially in
the middle of this bunch of freaks.

55:44.541 --> 55:47.124
They all fancy Carole Robertson, see?

55:47.250 --> 55:51.415
Well, you can look,
but you can't touch.

55:56.125 --> 55:58.415
There's only one person
that can have me.

55:58.541 --> 56:03.707
Although, if he really wants me,
he'll have to get that promotion.

56:04.625 --> 56:06.457
Time waits for no man.

56:12.416 --> 56:16.249
Yeah?
What have you got, darling?

56:19.916 --> 56:23.499
What do you think? Is it nice?
Oh, it's quite nice.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.415
That's it.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.332
Hello, darling.
Wave to the camera, darling.

56:48.541 --> 56:50.624
I'm not too sure about
this one, Bruce.

56:53.750 --> 56:56.540
- Hello?
- I bet...

56:58.125 --> 57:01.915
You've been thinking about me a lot,
haven't you, Bunty?

57:03.541 --> 57:06.249
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

57:07.500 --> 57:11.415
I bet they told you
to ignore me, though.

57:11.541 --> 57:14.832
- Didn't they?
- Oh yes, they fucking did.

57:15.541 --> 57:17.124
But...

57:17.833 --> 57:20.165
This is...

57:21.750 --> 57:24.082
so much more fun, Frank.

57:24.916 --> 57:26.790
Would you...

57:28.333 --> 57:30.707
What?

57:33.416 --> 57:35.582
Would you

57:35.666 --> 57:38.665
like to see my cock,

57:39.791 --> 57:41.332
Bunty?

57:41.500 --> 57:44.624
I'd like to do more than that, Frank.

57:46.041 --> 57:48.999
I'd like to

57:49.083 --> 57:52.332
put your cock in my fucking mouth.

57:53.625 --> 57:56.624
That's what I would like to do.

57:58.333 --> 58:01.832
And then I would like you

58:01.916 --> 58:04.165
to put your cock

58:04.250 --> 58:07.999
inside of my fucking beautiful body.

58:10.541 --> 58:14.915
That's what I would like, Frank,
and for you to go as fast as you can.

58:15.041 --> 58:17.874
Fucking go as fast

58:17.958 --> 58:19.999
as you can, Frank!

58:23.250 --> 58:25.624
Fuck me. Fuck me!

58:28.791 --> 58:31.415
- Yeah!
- That's what I'd like, Frank.

58:38.125 --> 58:42.249
How's the lovely
Carole at Christmas?

58:42.333 --> 58:45.124
A lovely Christmas carol.

58:45.250 --> 58:46.832
Yes?

59:09.541 --> 59:11.165
Eh? Eh?

59:11.458 --> 59:13.165
Eh?

59:13.250 --> 59:15.749
Bigger pain, bigger jar.

59:15.833 --> 59:18.915
Bigger pills, Bruce, yes?

59:19.041 --> 59:20.207
Yeah!

59:20.291 --> 59:24.124
Fuck you, Carole Robertson!
Fuck you, Carole Robertson!

59:26.041 --> 59:27.999
Turn off my gas, Bruce!

59:31.083 --> 59:34.624
Fuck you, Dougie Gillman!

59:40.833 --> 59:42.915
Repressed people.

59:43.041 --> 59:46.040
You have to pity them
more than anything else.

59:47.041 --> 59:49.582
I was like that before I met Bruce.

59:50.791 --> 59:53.165
But he brought me out of myself.

59:56.041 --> 59:59.124
That's what our sex club was about.

01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.832
Bruce knows that
our wee games and flirtations

01:00:02.916 --> 01:00:07.624
only serve to strengthen our love by
making it confront its true nature.

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:11.915
I'm a better person now.

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:14.832
A different person.

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:51.540
The fucking bitch has left me.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:56.457
Christmas fucking Day
and the bitch leaves me.

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:08.624
- Merry Christmas, Robbo!
- Aye, same to you, Gus. Same to you.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.332
So what's your plans, then?

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:13.499
Ah, just the usual family
shite and all that.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:15.207
Me, too.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.415
Fuck!

01:02:20.208 --> 01:02:22.790
Are you all right, Bruce?

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:25.124
Oh, aye.

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:27.915
- Are you all right, Robbo?
- Aye.

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:32.915
- Happy Christmas, sir.
- Don't you "Happy Christmas" me.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.915
- Come again?
- Look at the state you're in, Bruce.

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:38.249
You're a disgrace to the force.
This murder case is still hanging over us

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:40.832
and you haven't even managed to find
the Blades' phantom phone-caller.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.499
I am quickly becoming
the laughing-stock of the Lodge.

01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:46.790
And you are about to lose any chance
you ever had of this promotion.

01:02:46.916 --> 01:02:49.124
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I know who the pervert is, sir.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.415
Aye...

01:02:51.666 --> 01:02:52.999
It's Clifford Blades.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.332
It's Clifford Blades himself, sir.

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:01.832
I'll get you proof.

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:05.040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:20.999
Davie.

01:03:26.625 --> 01:03:28.624
Davie, it wasn't my fault.

01:03:32.625 --> 01:03:33.707
It wasn't my...

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:47.249
Your message sounded urgent,
so I came straight over.

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:49.874
I wanted to drop your
present off anyway

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:52.124
because I'm going to England
to see my parents.

01:03:52.208 --> 01:03:54.165
Mother's not very well.

01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:57.749
Bunty's not best pleased
about me going.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:59.415
This creep just won't
stop phoning her.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.707
I... I never got you anything.

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:05.624
Doesn't matter.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.332
It's good to see you, pal.

01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:12.124
Good to see somebody.

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:15.040
Good to see you.

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:18.832
You want a wee whisky? Cheer you up.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.707
- No, best not. I'm driving.
- You'll fucking sit down, man!

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:25.415
You'll stay over here tonight
and you'll go tomorrow, OK?

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.749
OK.

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:30.624
- Won't your wife mind?
- She's at her mum's. Her mum's in Aviemore.

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:35.277
Old bird's on her last
legs with heart disease.

01:04:35.303 --> 01:04:36.607
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:41.540
No, don't fucking worry about it.
Stupid slag brought it on herself.

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:46.832
See, the amount of chocolate, booze and
fags she consumes, it is fucking criminal.

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:49.790
- What about your daughter?
- Christ, that's enough of the family pish!

01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:05.040
Now...

01:05:05.916 --> 01:05:09.374
I've got a cheeky wee
single malt here for you.

01:05:10.916 --> 01:05:13.749
Only for the developed
palate, 49 years aged.

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:17.124
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas
and all that shite.

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:26.332
Well, I suppose one between friends
couldn't hurt.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.624
Aye.

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:29.707
- Happy Christmas.
- Is it?

01:05:30.916 --> 01:05:32.749
How are you getting on
with that whisky then, Bladesey?

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:34.749
Feel a bit tipsy, Bruce.

01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:43.707
Hello
and welcome to the Fantastic...

01:05:43.833 --> 01:05:46.415
Manchester! Manchester!

01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:49.957
- You do it, man.
- No.

01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.249
- Come on, give it a try.
- No, really, Bruce.

01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:52.707
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- It's not in my nature.

01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.624
Come on, don't be such
a fucking spoilsport.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:59.249
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Frank Sidebottom.

01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.499
I'm Frank Sidebottom.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.790
My name is Frank Sidebottom.

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.374
This is a lovely surprise.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:30.415
I was just checking up on my best
mate's missus while he was away,

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.499
seeing she was safe and secure
and all that, you know?

01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:36.165
I don't know why you bother with him.
He's weak.

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:37.790
Not like you.

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.499
No, no, no, he's...
He's one of the best, I say.

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:41.999
That's what I say. He's one of the best.

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:44.790
Oh, I wish I had a friend
who was as loyal as you.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.457
You must see some terrible things
in your line of work.

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:53.665
Aye, I do. I really do, you know?

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:55.290
But you just...
You just deal with it.

01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:58.124
Like you do, Bunty,
with this prank phone-caller.

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:01.374
You don't seem to let
it get to you, do you?

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:07.707
Well, that's what I try to make him
think. But, you know, it hurts terribly.

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:09.415
Uh-huh.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.540
I just wish Clifford could
be as strong as you.

01:07:16.416 --> 01:07:17.790
Fuck.

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:24.207
Fuck! Wait a minute.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:27.915
This is wrong. Cliff's all right.
This is... This is really wrong.

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.374
No, no, no!

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:33.832
No, it's... It's... It's OK.
This is so right.

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:49.165
No, no!

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:50.457
- What's wrong?
- It's just the...

01:07:50.541 --> 01:07:51.874
- Just what?
- It's just...

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.749
I think Cliff might be
your phantom phone-caller.

01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:58.374
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Come on.

01:08:00.916 --> 01:08:03.999
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Frank Sidebottom.

01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:06.624
It's Frank Sidebottom.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:10.207
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Frank Sidebottom.

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:11.874
It's Frank Sidebottom.

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.957
Oh, my God!

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:16.165
Ah, Bruce eh?

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:17.332
Fuck.

01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:21.790
Or would you like me to call you by
your little brother's name, Davie, yes?

01:08:21.957 --> 01:08:24.582
- What?
- Baby brothers, Bruce.

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.624
Such a nuisance.

01:08:26.707 --> 01:08:29.499
But you were supposed to look out
for little brother Davie, yes?

01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:31.082
No, no, I wasn't.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.957
It was your idea to steal
the coal, though, yes?

01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:35.915
No, that was Davie's idea.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.582
The added incentive
of trying to please your father.

01:08:38.666 --> 01:08:40.832
"Let's climb the coal
mountain," you said.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.374
That's it. Just little boys
playing games, Doctor.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:47.790
The games, Bruce. The games.
The same rules apply, though.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:51.624
"I'm the king of the castle!
Get down you, dirty rascal!"

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:53.082
Then you pushed him off.

01:08:53.207 --> 01:08:54.415
No, I never. No, I fucking never!

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.582
- Not an angry push...
- No, I didn't.

01:08:56.707 --> 01:09:01.207
Just a brotherly shove.
Brotherly love, a brotherly shove.

01:09:02.416 --> 01:09:07.499
Because wee Davie was better at everything
than his big brother, "the other laddie".

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:09.415
That's what they used
to say in the village.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.082
"Davie Robertson and
the other laddie."

01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:14.082
You're still just "the
other laddie", aren't you?

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:15.457
You fuck off!

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:19.624
"Fuck off", you shout,
as you push him down the slag pile.

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:22.499
He's at the bottom,
screaming for help

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:27.082
as the black stuff rushes down,
smothering your brother underneath.

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:28.665
No, I tried to save him.

01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:33.499
Then the man you call father, crouching
beside the body of his real son,

01:09:33.582 --> 01:09:39.582
"This thing killed him. This bastard
spawn of the devil killed my laddie.

01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:42.499
"You are filth!"

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:45.082
No! No!

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:46.790
No, no...

01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:50.582
What are you doing
in the women's toilets, Bruce?

01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:52.915
Fuck off, Drummond.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.582
- You can say it's none of my business.
- It's none of your fucking business!

01:09:55.666 --> 01:09:56.915
What were you doing
in the women's toilets, Bruce?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.999
Look, I'm sorry.

01:09:58.083 --> 01:10:01.332
I'm just feeling a bit wrong
at the moment. OK?

01:10:01.416 --> 01:10:03.290
OK, well, if you want to talk
about it, then I'm here.

01:10:03.375 --> 01:10:07.332
Spare me your airy-fairy,
namby-pamby, care-in-the-community,

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:09.415
human-resources, left-wing bullshit.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.290
Well, I'm just worried
about you, Bruce.

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:15.915
- What did you say?
- I said, I'm worried about you, Bruce.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.999
Oh, right, I see.
You're worried about me.

01:10:18.166 --> 01:10:20.707
What? Oh, don't flatter yourself.

01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:23.461
I think you're a silly,
silly, little, little man.

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:24.399
You fancy me.

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:27.999
I have no interest in you, apart
from us having to work together.

01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:30.915
- Just give in to your instincts, darling.
- Oh, God, you're pathetic.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.999
- You're pathetic. You're an alcoholic.
- Fuck off.

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:35.665
You stink.
Do you know what, Bruce?

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:39.999
You're the kind of sad case
that preys on weak, stupid women

01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:42.582
in order to boost your
own shattered ego!

01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:44.499
What about Karen the other night
at the Christmas party?

01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.707
She was wasted, Bruce.

01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:49.207
Well, she shouldn't have
fucking drunk then, should she?

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.915
She wanted a drink, so she had one.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.915
She wanted a ride,
so she had one of them as well.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.290
So, don't treat me
like a fucking rapist!

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:58.124
Jesus Christ, what are you so
interested in her for anyway?

01:10:58.208 --> 01:11:01.540
- Are you a lesbian?
- I'm not a bloody lesbian, Bruce.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:04.707
I have a boyfriend
and he's far younger than you

01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:06.707
and he's far more
intelligent than you

01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:10.624
and he's far better endowed than you,
Mr Photocopier Enlargement.

01:11:10.708 --> 01:11:12.124
What did you fucking say?

01:11:12.208 --> 01:11:15.874
Go on, fucking hit me, Bruce!
Are you gonna hit me, Bruce? Yeah?

01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:21.707
No.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.582
Oh, my darling, I'm sorry.

01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:30.957
You sicken me.

01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:35.082
You repulse me.
Can I make that any fucking plainer?

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:44.749
I wasn't gonna hurt you, you know?

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:48.415
I didn't mean it.

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:03.207
As your colleague...

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:08.582
and as a human being, I'm telling you,
Bruce, you've got some stuff to sort out.

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:14.082
OK? Then you might become
the sort of person

01:12:14.166 --> 01:12:16.540
that you seem to imagine
yourself to be,

01:12:16.708 --> 01:12:18.665
although Christ only
knows what that is.

01:12:19.583 --> 01:12:22.207
I used to be good at
this job, Amanda.

01:12:25.916 --> 01:12:27.499
I used to be a good person.

01:12:28.416 --> 01:12:30.332
Yeah. I heard that.

01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:36.707
- Have you got a wife, Bruce?
- Yeah.

01:12:39.291 --> 01:12:40.874
Have you got any kids?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.582
Stacey.

01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:49.165
I think they've left me.

01:12:52.583 --> 01:12:54.915
I think my family have left me.

01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.249
I don't know how.

01:13:04.791 --> 01:13:06.874
I can't remember why.

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.665
OK.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.832
You see, there's
something wrong with me.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:20.082
There's something
seriously wrong with me.

01:13:21.708 --> 01:13:26.082
Have you spoken to anyone?
Have you been to see a doctor?

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:29.790
No.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.124
I don't know. I don't know.

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:39.749
No, I'm in charge.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:45.249
I'm in charge of me.

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:48.290
I'm in charge of this investigation and
don't you ever fucking forget that.

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:51.707
OK, Bruce. You need to listen to me.
Can you hear me?

01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:56.582
I'm really worried about you. I don't
think you're fit for work at the moment.

01:13:56.708 --> 01:14:00.499
Just you go up there
and suck someone's cock

01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:06.165
and stop playing the amateur fucking
psychologist, you evil witch!

01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:13.707
Hey, Robbo.

01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:15.957
Are you holding a guy
by the name of Clifford Blades?

01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:18.499
Do you ever get the impression
he was a pervert?

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:21.749
Just give me the fucking keys!

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:28.207
- You piss-taking little fart!
- What's wrong, Bruce?

01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:31.499
You strung me along from the
fucking start! Didn't you?

01:14:31.583 --> 01:14:33.707
It wasn't me.
You have to believe it wasn't me.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:36.249
Don't make me punch your face
through your shoulders

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:39.124
and out through your fucking arse,
you speccy wee fanny!

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.707
Why? Why did you drag
me into this, Cliff?

01:14:41.791 --> 01:14:45.290
Why did you drag me into this with you?
You're supposed to be my mate.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:47.374
I didn't. We are mates, Bruce.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:50.082
You're my best friend, Bruce.
You're my best friend.

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:58.790
Why do you bully me, Bruce?

01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:02.707
- What?
- Why do you do it?

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.582
Because...

01:15:07.916 --> 01:15:10.999
Because I can't fucking help myself.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:15.999
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:17.832
Bruce! Bruce!

01:15:17.916 --> 01:15:22.165
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:30.415
Fuck!

01:15:31.166 --> 01:15:34.332
I tried to call you at work.
Where have you been?

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:37.957
- Bruce, Dougie's in hospital.
- And?

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:40.124
He tried to kill himself.

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:41.790
Slashed his wrists.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.915
He found out about us, Bruce.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.290
Couldn't take the humiliation
of that and getting suspended.

01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:50.082
How's that my fault?
That's all your fault!

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:54.165
My God, this place fucking stinks.

01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:55.790
I just need you to fucking leave!

01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:57.082
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:59.290
- I wanna turn off the gas for you.
- Chrissie, don't. Chrissie.

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:02.582
- I wanna turn off the gas for you.
- Chrissie, I need you to leave!

01:16:06.791 --> 01:16:09.999
Come on! I wanna turn off
the fucking gas for you!

01:16:10.083 --> 01:16:11.790
Fucking...

01:16:12.708 --> 01:16:17.415
Come on, get fucking hard, you silly
wee poof! Come on, get it in!

01:16:17.666 --> 01:16:19.790
Fuck me with that mouse's cock.

01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:34.290
What's wrong?
You're crying like a wee laddie.

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:39.457
You're no fun any more, Bruce.
You know that?

01:16:40.666 --> 01:16:42.290
I'm not well.

01:16:42.375 --> 01:16:44.499
What's wrong with you, man?

01:16:46.916 --> 01:16:48.915
I hear voices, Chrissie.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.499
I see things, all the time.

01:16:56.791 --> 01:16:58.915
Do you ever hear them?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.415
What are you on about?

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.790
Whatever it is you're taking,
you wanna lay off it.

01:17:05.791 --> 01:17:09.290
Life's cruel, Bruce. Life's cruel.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:26.207
People ask me, "Carole, how do you and
Bruce keep the spice in your marriage?"

01:17:26.291 --> 01:17:29.915
Well,
I tell them it's really simple.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.999
- I'm just the ultimate tease.
- "I'm just the ultimate tease.

01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:36.790
"Me and Bruce,
we're not that different.

01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:38.499
"We know what we want

01:17:38.583 --> 01:17:40.415
"We know how to get it.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:44.249
"Like this promotion he's going for.
We both know he'll win.

01:17:44.583 --> 01:17:46.332
"And when he does,

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:51.332
"the Robertson household is going
to be one big happy family again.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.290
"I kid you not."

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.832
You coming for a wee
ride, sweetheart?

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:29.540
I knew I'd seen you before.
The fucking freak from the tunnel.

01:18:50.291 --> 01:18:52.332
You are a sick fairy.

01:18:52.416 --> 01:18:55.415
My husband is Detective
Sergeant Bruce Robertson.

01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:38.790
We have to go
all the way with this pig.

01:19:38.916 --> 01:19:40.707
You know what that means, Ocky?

01:19:40.875 --> 01:19:44.374
Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on, right.
Wait a minute.

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:46.999
You can't waste a cop, man.

01:19:49.791 --> 01:19:52.374
You never said you were gonna...

01:19:53.375 --> 01:19:55.874
- Fuck.
- He saw us do the gook, for fuck's sake!

01:19:58.708 --> 01:20:00.915
But dead cunts tell no tales.

01:20:03.208 --> 01:20:07.082
We can torch the place with the
pig in it. Or what's left of him.

01:20:07.208 --> 01:20:09.624
Smokey bacon, man.

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:14.915
Get your fucking hands off her stuff!

01:20:16.416 --> 01:20:17.582
You fucking die.

01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:23.165
I want to hear you squeal,
like the fucking pig you are.

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:27.124
Get fucking out.

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:30.207
Don't you leave!
Don't you fucking leave!

01:20:30.708 --> 01:20:32.457
Don't you leave this fucking room!

01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:35.332
Don't you fucking close that door!
Fuck!

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.124
Why didn't you arrest us
when you had the chance?

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:42.415
Scared they'd find out
you're a fucking queer?

01:20:42.625 --> 01:20:44.624
- Just you and me, Detective.
- No!

01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:45.957
No!

01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:17.332
You see, I've always
hated you fucking pigs.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:23.999
But not in the normal way your average
low-life scum like me hates them.

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:28.582
You see, I've always hated them
in a special way.

01:21:31.416 --> 01:21:34.915
But you...
You're different, sweetheart.

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:39.707
I'll make an honest
woman of you yet.

01:21:50.916 --> 01:21:52.415
You thought you could take me, eh?

01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:55.415
You sick,

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.915
sexy, wee pansy.

01:23:03.916 --> 01:23:07.332
You really fucked up this time,
didn't you, Bruce?

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:17.624
Ambulance is on the way, Bruce.

01:23:18.833 --> 01:23:20.332
Don't go.

01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:23.582
Don't go, brother.

01:23:30.583 --> 01:23:34.207
I just wanted to keep her
close to me, you know?

01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:01.374
Might not seem appropriate, but...

01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:05.165
Happy New Year, Robbo.

01:24:05.333 --> 01:24:06.832
Aye, happy New Year.

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:11.665
Listen, Bruce, um...

01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:16.874
We obviously had to withdraw
your application for the promotion.

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:21.457
Now is not the right time
for you to meet the board.

01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:24.749
You see that, right?

01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:27.374
Aye.

01:24:27.458 --> 01:24:29.915
And you're back in uniform, Bruce.

01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:31.707
It is a demotion.

01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:37.582
Of course, Bruce, I don't need to
tell you that obviously I was chuffed

01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:39.040
about the promotion.

01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:42.332
But it has been
a bittersweet experience for me.

01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:47.249
If you hadn't had the...
the issues you've been having,

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.040
I'm sure you would have walked it.

01:24:50.166 --> 01:24:52.165
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:56.415
I suppose everybody feels like this
when they actually get a promotion.

01:24:57.416 --> 01:25:00.874
You know, how best to work
with old mates and all that.

01:25:01.625 --> 01:25:04.207
Your methods and mine
are very different.

01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.665
And I know we've pulled
some stuff in the past,

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:10.415
but all the coke and the
hookers and stuff...

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.415
- That's finito now.
- Aye.

01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:17.415
You understand, little piggy?

01:25:20.166 --> 01:25:21.665
No hard feelings, eh?

01:25:21.833 --> 01:25:24.832
No hard feelings, pal.
Same rules apply.

01:25:28.041 --> 01:25:29.749
Oh, by the way...

01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:34.874
I saw your wee speccy mate Bladesey
down the Lodge.

01:25:34.958 --> 01:25:37.374
The old phantom phone-caller, eh?

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:41.249
We told the sick bastard he's not welcome
at the Craft if he keeps that shite up.

01:25:43.166 --> 01:25:44.749
See you later, then...

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:46.582
Frank.

01:26:27.333 --> 01:26:28.832
No, don't...

01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:35.957
OK, let's go...
Let's get out of here.

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:37.540
Stacey!

01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:41.165
St...

01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:45.790
Hey.

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:47.707
Oh, shit.

01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:52.582
I'm really sorry for startling you...

01:26:54.958 --> 01:26:56.665
No, it's...

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.749
It's OK. It's...

01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:00.457
It's OK.

01:27:00.958 --> 01:27:03.415
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

01:27:03.541 --> 01:27:06.624
- You look a bit...
- Hmm?

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.749
Ah, I'm just, um...

01:27:13.958 --> 01:27:15.249
I'm just undercover.

01:27:15.416 --> 01:27:17.540
I'm on, um, stakeout and...

01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:20.915
You see, there's some really
shifty-looking characters in here tonight

01:27:21.041 --> 01:27:22.957
and I'm just trying to blend in.

01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:28.332
- Come on, Mummy, I'm hungry.
- I better get him home for his dinner.

01:27:28.458 --> 01:27:30.165
Aye, right, of course.

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:33.415
- I'll see you around, then.
- Don't leave.

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:06.040
Hi, Detective Robertson,
it's Mary here.

01:28:06.166 --> 01:28:09.624
Sorry, I know it's probably
none of my business, but...

01:28:13.333 --> 01:28:16.415
Look, um, I was just
thinking that maybe

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:18.957
me and Euan could pop round
on our way to the park.

01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:15.165
Right. Bladesey.

01:29:16.375 --> 01:29:19.457
Uh, first things first.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.124
You've really got to get rid
of the double glazing, pal.

01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:31.457
Get yourself contact lenses or
something, laser eye treatment

01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:34.915
cos nobody's ever gonna take you seriously
staring through those thick milk bottles.

01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:41.915
Second thing is, you've really
got to try and toughen up.

01:29:42.041 --> 01:29:44.124
Right, you're a nice guy.

01:29:44.916 --> 01:29:47.165
But you're very soft.

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:52.749
Truth is, people are just as scared
of the world as you are.

01:29:52.875 --> 01:29:55.040
I'm scared of the world.

01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:59.249
I just don't let people
see it, that's all.

01:30:00.666 --> 01:30:03.040
And that's what the games are.

01:30:03.166 --> 01:30:05.790
I kid you not, my
sweet, sweet friend.

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:09.749
You're my best friend.

01:30:11.625 --> 01:30:13.540
My only friend.

01:30:18.166 --> 01:30:20.124
Most important thing is this, though.

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:23.249
You've got to make
Bunty want you again.

01:30:23.375 --> 01:30:25.874
You'll probably find
that she does actually like you

01:30:25.958 --> 01:30:29.499
if you just asserted yourself
a wee bit more.

01:30:30.166 --> 01:30:33.665
You know, you show her passion
and she will run to you.

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:36.624
She will love you until
the day you die.

01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:43.332
I may not be the one to be
giving marriage counselling,

01:30:43.458 --> 01:30:47.415
but sometimes it takes a wrongdoer
to show you when you're doing wrong.

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:50.457
I'm sorry, Bladesey.

01:30:52.625 --> 01:30:54.165
Really sorry, pal.

01:31:01.958 --> 01:31:03.457
Bunty!

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:51.165
Same rules apply.
