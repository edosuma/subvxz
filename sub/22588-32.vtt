00:15.677 --> 00:18.477

00:23.115 --> 00:26.350
<i> What the blazes was his game?</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:30.520
<i> He was after a roll.</i>

00:30.522 --> 00:33.356
<i> A tasty payroll.</i>

00:33.358 --> 00:34.757
<i> But this roll had a twist.</i>

00:34.759 --> 00:38.794
<i> A crooked crew</i>

00:40.797 --> 00:45.700

00:47.302 --> 00:49.169

00:49.171 --> 00:50.136

03:32.907 --> 03:35.541
Batman! Wait!

03:43.349 --> 03:46.417
I'm so ashamed, Batman, the way
I behaved at that party.

03:46.419 --> 03:47.851
It's not your fault,
commissioner.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.119
Riddler's henchmen spiked
your drinks with temper tonic.

03:50.121 --> 03:52.488
Now you've taken
my universal drug antidote

03:52.490 --> 03:53.856
you'll be alright.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.824
Yes, but still
my unseemly behavior

03:55.826 --> 03:57.726
certainly contributed
towards Robin's capture.

03:57.728 --> 03:59.026
Let that be a lesson.

03:59.028 --> 04:02.530
In future, be more careful from
whom you accept free lemonade.

04:04.365 --> 04:05.431
What the blazes!

04:05.933 --> 04:09.434
'Great Scott, Batman!
Look up there.'

04:09.436 --> 04:12.437
A parachute blossoming.

04:12.439 --> 04:16.107
"A bear like a fallen tree?"

04:16.774 --> 04:22.112
Easy. A bear lumbers and
a fallen tree becomes lumber.

04:22.848 --> 04:25.481
Good grief!
Another one.

04:25.483 --> 04:28.784
'"Why is silk like grass?"'

04:28.786 --> 04:29.851
Even easier.

04:29.853 --> 04:33.020
You measure both by the yard.

04:34.155 --> 04:36.723
Lumber...yard..

04:36.725 --> 04:38.491
The Gotham Lumberyard!

04:38.493 --> 04:41.660
That must be where
he's holding Robin.

04:42.161 --> 04:43.161
'Goodbye, commissioner.'

04:43.163 --> 04:44.662
Speed to headquarters.

04:44.664 --> 04:46.797
I'll call you if I need help.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.600
Goodbye, Batman.

04:51.702 --> 04:54.002
Save that boy!

05:12.585 --> 05:15.486
Robin!

05:15.488 --> 05:17.354
Robin!

05:17.356 --> 05:18.722
Do you hear me?

05:18.924 --> 05:22.558
Too late.
He's history now, Batman.

05:23.260 --> 05:25.393
I'll do better
than that, Riddler.

05:28.830 --> 05:29.696
Question.

05:29.698 --> 05:32.799
When is a man
a stupid relative, huh?

05:34.568 --> 05:38.303
I've heard enough
of your murderous riddles.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.237
Surprise, Batman.

05:39.239 --> 05:42.841
This is what is known in
the film game as a two-parter.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.775
Look!

06:02.394 --> 06:06.630
"When is a man
like a stupid relative?"

06:06.632 --> 06:10.367
When he's a mannequin.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.438
A dummy.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.640
Robin?

06:17.642 --> 06:19.308
Riddler?

06:25.448 --> 06:28.782
Stop! Surrender!
Give yourself up.

06:28.784 --> 06:31.484
By all that's holy
I might forget myself

06:31.486 --> 06:34.220
and do you violence.

06:37.591 --> 06:39.224
My name is Pauline.

06:39.226 --> 06:42.160
My lawyer's name
is Mr. Oliver Wendell.

06:42.162 --> 06:44.829
Why don't you look him up
and buzz him?

06:44.831 --> 06:47.164
No use, Batman.
She's hard as nails.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.999
Knows her legal rights too.

06:49.001 --> 06:53.336
A frustrated,
would-be actress..

06:53.338 --> 06:55.037
...a star that was never born

06:55.039 --> 06:59.041
venting her disappointment
on society.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.778
Only one thing to do,
commissioner.

07:04.714 --> 07:07.482
Take her to the Batcave
and work on her.

07:07.484 --> 07:08.082
Great Scott, Batman.

07:08.084 --> 07:11.018
Revealing its location
will be tantamount to..

07:11.020 --> 07:12.419
...taking off your mask.

07:12.421 --> 07:13.620
Not quite, commissioner.

07:13.622 --> 07:17.090
Before the trip, I intend
to render her senseless

07:17.092 --> 07:18.758
with a whiff

07:18.760 --> 07:19.825
of Batgas.

07:19.827 --> 07:20.959
Hey, now, wait a minute.

07:20.961 --> 07:23.828
I'd like you to come along
too, commissioner.

07:23.830 --> 07:25.629
Me? To the Batcave?

07:25.631 --> 07:27.897
When it's a question
of Robin's safety

07:27.899 --> 07:30.065
I don't entirely trust myself.

07:30.067 --> 07:32.600
I'd like a witness present
to make sure

07:32.602 --> 07:33.701
that I don't employ methods

07:33.703 --> 07:35.936
which might bounce back
on me in court.

07:35.938 --> 07:41.107
Well, of course, if you wish
my presence, Batman, I'll..

07:41.109 --> 07:43.676
Uh, Batgas for me as well?

07:43.678 --> 07:46.912
It's a precaution I have
to take, commissioner.

07:46.914 --> 07:49.981
If you were captured and
tortured by criminals

07:49.983 --> 07:52.817
you might reveal the location
of the Batcave.

07:52.819 --> 07:55.519
I place myself
in your hands, Batman

07:55.521 --> 07:58.855
with the most serene confidence.

07:59.489 --> 08:02.023
Sit down, commissioner.

08:03.158 --> 08:04.992
Restrain her, Chief O'Hara.

08:04.994 --> 08:07.794
Hey! Hey, wait.
Wait, I want my lawyer.

08:07.796 --> 08:10.096
Help! No, don't you dare.

08:13.900 --> 08:18.904
I assure you, commissioner,
the sensation is not unpleasant.

08:18.906 --> 08:21.006
Your handkerchief?

08:30.515 --> 08:32.148
Great science!

08:32.150 --> 08:34.616
Chief O'Hara,
summon some men.

08:34.619 --> 08:38.087
We'll need help in getting them
to the Batmobile.

09:00.675 --> 09:02.575
Great Scott!

09:02.577 --> 09:06.045
At last, the fabulous Batcave.

09:06.047 --> 09:10.549
- Unusual, isn't it?
- Oh, magnificent!

09:10.750 --> 09:14.719
I feel as if I've awakened
in some future age.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.755
Such equipment.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.789
What fantastic ingenuity

09:18.791 --> 09:20.957
you and the Boy Wonder
have employed

09:20.959 --> 09:23.125
in hooking it together.

09:23.127 --> 09:23.692
True.

09:23.694 --> 09:27.629
We did muster many long hours
of brain power.

09:27.631 --> 09:31.833
However, this is no time
for self-congratulation.

09:31.835 --> 09:34.235
A small demonstration
will now take place.

09:34.237 --> 09:37.038
- A demonstration?
- Yes, commissioner.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.106
Take this can of Batwake.

09:39.108 --> 09:41.575
When I give you
this signal

09:41.577 --> 09:44.578
spray a whiff of it
in the prisoner's face.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.346
Certainly.

09:59.659 --> 10:02.761
You will notice, commissioner,
that this Batmask in most ways

10:02.763 --> 10:06.698
resembles an ordinary
operating room oxygen mask.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.200
I will introduce
no drugs, no serums

10:09.202 --> 10:10.868
into Pauline's bloodstream.

10:10.870 --> 10:12.303
I understand.

10:12.305 --> 10:14.338
Now, commissioner.

10:15.272 --> 10:18.841
- Give her the Batwake, please.
- Oh-oh, yeah.

10:25.215 --> 10:26.915
Where am I?

10:27.317 --> 10:28.249
Deep..

10:28.251 --> 10:32.486
...in the entrails
of the earth, Pauline.

10:32.488 --> 10:34.354
Where every instrument

10:34.356 --> 10:38.825
has been designed
to combat crime

10:38.827 --> 10:40.493
and smear its perpetrators.

10:40.495 --> 10:44.630
There are those who came
to this Batcave

10:44.632 --> 10:46.932
and never left.

10:46.934 --> 10:49.734
That is true.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.635
Now, tell me.

10:51.637 --> 10:55.639
Where is Robin being held?

10:55.641 --> 10:57.474
I don't know.

10:57.476 --> 10:59.442
Are you sure?

10:59.444 --> 11:01.544
Yes, I'm..

11:01.546 --> 11:02.978
I only know..

11:02.980 --> 11:04.813
'Yes.'

11:04.815 --> 11:07.582
'...the clues,
two riddles.'

11:07.584 --> 11:08.816
Give them.

11:08.818 --> 11:12.853
Why was Flo Zigfield
like a nearsighted man?

11:12.855 --> 11:16.823
Because they both
put on spectacles.

11:16.825 --> 11:17.924
Two?

11:17.926 --> 11:22.261
What kind of men
are always above board?

11:22.263 --> 11:23.962
Chessmen.

11:33.738 --> 11:37.140
Join me over here, commissioner.

11:42.045 --> 11:44.246
Watch very carefully,
commissioner.

11:44.248 --> 11:47.749
I'm going to mingle
Pauline's captured breath

11:47.751 --> 11:49.650
with a clear liquid
in this container.

11:49.652 --> 11:52.319
What do you hope to discover,
Caped Crusader?

11:52.321 --> 11:54.387
The truth, commissioner.

11:54.389 --> 11:56.489
If Pauline's answers
were true

11:56.491 --> 11:59.758
then the oxygen content
of her breath

11:59.760 --> 12:02.193
will turn this liquid red.

12:02.195 --> 12:03.327
If, however, she lied

12:03.329 --> 12:05.262
then the increase
in her metabolism

12:05.264 --> 12:07.430
will increase the oxygen
content of her breath

12:07.432 --> 12:10.699
and cause an imbalance which
will leave this liquid clear

12:10.701 --> 12:13.168
and undisturbed.
Do you understand?

12:13.170 --> 12:15.770
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

12:17.339 --> 12:18.605
Now..

12:18.607 --> 12:20.440
...for the test.

12:20.442 --> 12:23.643
Would you squeeze the bag,
commissioner?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.412
Thank you.

12:40.225 --> 12:41.792
Fantastic!

12:41.794 --> 12:43.760
Oh, I doff my hat to you,
Batman.

12:43.762 --> 12:47.196
No wonder you're
the nemesis of crime.

12:49.465 --> 12:52.467
Obviously you were telling
the truth, young lady.

12:52.469 --> 12:55.369
A wise decision,
I promise you.

13:06.448 --> 13:08.415
Commissioner.

13:14.387 --> 13:17.222
You observed I used
no undue methods

13:17.224 --> 13:18.156
to extract that confession.

13:18.158 --> 13:21.159
Oh, none whatever. I'd affirm
that in the highest court

13:21.161 --> 13:21.893
in the land.

13:22.395 --> 13:26.296
But what do those strange
clues mean, Batman?

13:26.298 --> 13:27.530
Simple, commissioner.

13:27.532 --> 13:29.698
Look at it in the context
of the theme

13:29.700 --> 13:31.933
which has run
throughout this entire case.

13:31.935 --> 13:34.168
Silent movies.

13:34.170 --> 13:37.004
Uh, clue one. Spectacles.

13:37.006 --> 13:38.171
Harold Lloyd of course.

13:38.173 --> 13:39.939
He always wore spectacles.

13:39.941 --> 13:42.675
And he was often found
perilously balanced

13:42.677 --> 13:45.344
on the ledge
of a high building.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.778
Chessmen.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.246
The Chessman Building!

13:48.248 --> 13:49.380
Right, commissioner.

13:49.682 --> 13:52.082
I'll call Chief O'Hara
on the Batphone

13:52.084 --> 13:54.250
alert where to find you
along the roadside.

13:54.252 --> 13:58.621
I'll also tell him that he will
find the standby container

13:58.623 --> 14:02.091
of Batwake in your
right-hand coat pocket.

14:02.093 --> 14:04.393
Uh, right.
Oh, thank you.

14:04.395 --> 14:07.396
This, uh.. This has been
a privilege, Batman.

14:07.398 --> 14:09.197
A rare privilege.

14:09.199 --> 14:10.531
I thank you.

14:10.533 --> 14:14.101
- You're welcome.
- Fire away.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.711
<i> Meanwhile, on a narrow ledge</i>

14:24.713 --> 14:28.548
<i> just below the roof of</i>
<i> the venerable Chessman Building</i>

14:28.550 --> 14:31.551
<i> the Riddler</i>
<i> and his felonious filmsters</i>

14:31.553 --> 14:33.786
<i> prepare to shoot</i>
<i> a shattering spectacle.</i>

14:33.788 --> 14:37.924
<i> Stolen straight</i>
<i> from Harold Lloyd.</i>

14:40.628 --> 14:41.627
Coming up..

14:41.629 --> 14:44.096
...the last reel
in our drama

14:44.098 --> 14:46.798
starring the Boy Wonder

14:46.800 --> 14:48.032
going down.

14:50.269 --> 14:51.167
This time..

14:51.169 --> 14:53.936
...no whimsical dummy,
but the real thing.

14:53.938 --> 14:57.139
You lowdown fiend,
what's the point of all of this?

14:57.141 --> 14:57.939
Comedy, Boy Wonder.

14:57.941 --> 15:00.940
Light-hearted comedy
to accommodate a connoisseur.

15:01.042 --> 15:05.411
Riddler, this life of crime has
finally softened your brain.

15:14.353 --> 15:14.985
Question.

15:14.987 --> 15:18.621
Can a robin fly
if his wings are clipped?

15:18.623 --> 15:21.624
You won't earn a nickel
murdering me, Riddler.

15:21.626 --> 15:23.258
This doesn't make sense.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.159
Correct, Boy Wonder.

15:25.161 --> 15:27.361
Not cents, dollars!

15:27.363 --> 15:31.465
At least one million dollars.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.367
Rehearsal.

15:34.369 --> 15:37.269
Make sure my safety belt
doesn't show.

15:37.271 --> 15:40.071
Sure, Riddler baby.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.606
'Make with the action.'

15:44.276 --> 15:46.709
Whoa-oh-oh!
Whoa-a-a-a!

15:46.711 --> 15:48.277
Whoa-a-a-a!

15:50.781 --> 15:52.113
Cut!

15:52.115 --> 15:54.014
End of rehearsal.

15:54.016 --> 15:56.216
This time, we film it.

15:56.218 --> 15:59.219
Uh, but little difference, ya?

15:59.221 --> 16:01.688
Ya. Little difference.

16:01.690 --> 16:08.728
This time, the Boy Wonder
makes the plunge.

16:08.962 --> 16:09.995
Rolling.

16:09.997 --> 16:12.864
Little mood music]

16:16.268 --> 16:18.168
Robin!

16:20.437 --> 16:21.403
Curses!

16:21.405 --> 16:24.939
The Batrope!
Grab it with your teeth.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.377
Hold on, Robin.
Tight.

16:30.379 --> 16:33.747
I'll raise you back up
to the ledge.

16:44.258 --> 16:46.492
- Are you alright, Robin?
- Holy molars!

16:46.494 --> 16:50.128
Am I ever gonna take good care
of my teeth.

16:50.130 --> 16:50.761
True.

16:50.763 --> 16:53.764
You owe your life
to dental hygiene.

16:53.766 --> 16:55.232
If only more people..

16:59.436 --> 17:01.170
Those cowardly crooks!

17:01.172 --> 17:02.738
They're escaping again.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.240
Only if we had our Batcopter.

17:07.843 --> 17:09.343
Holy smokes!
Sky writing.

17:09.345 --> 17:12.445
- More clues, no doubt.
- You're right, Batman.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.380
Look! A riddle!

17:13.382 --> 17:17.349
"What kind of machine
has ears?"

17:17.352 --> 17:19.352
That one's for
a nursery school.

17:19.354 --> 17:20.519
A train of course.

17:20.521 --> 17:21.819
A train has engineers.

17:21.821 --> 17:26.758
You want to land us all back up
in the pen again, baby?

17:26.760 --> 17:29.293
Lackeys, you don't realize

17:29.295 --> 17:33.230
these clues have
a false meaning.

17:34.098 --> 17:38.434
"A cowboy wear
a tight belt?"

17:38.436 --> 17:41.437
The same reason a policeman
or anyone else does.

17:41.439 --> 17:44.206
To hold up his pants.

17:47.410 --> 17:48.843
A train.

17:48.845 --> 17:50.311
A hold up.

17:50.313 --> 17:53.347
Well, the El Chief!

17:53.349 --> 17:54.614
- Which?
- The El Chief, Batman

17:54.616 --> 17:57.817
That famous train which all
the movie people used to take.

17:57.819 --> 18:00.252
The Riddler's planning
to hold it up.

18:00.254 --> 18:03.588
- Fits like a glove.
- Yes, it does.

18:03.590 --> 18:06.190
Very good thinking, Robin.

18:06.558 --> 18:09.393
Commissioner Gordon? Robin,
calling from the Batmobile.

18:09.395 --> 18:11.495
Thank heavens, Boy Wonder,
you are safe.

18:11.497 --> 18:13.230
- How do you feel?
- Just great.

18:13.232 --> 18:15.799
- How do you feel?
- No nauseous after-effects.

18:15.801 --> 18:20.303
Tell Batman it was like waking
from a strange refreshing dream.

18:20.305 --> 18:21.704
I'll do that, commissioner.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.772
In the meantime,
here's a red hot tip.

18:23.774 --> 18:27.375
Send every man you've got
to Gotham Central Station.

18:27.377 --> 18:29.543
Stake-out that famous train.

18:29.545 --> 18:31.211
The El Chief.

18:31.946 --> 18:35.347
<i> A strange and shocking twist</i>
<i> to the plot.</i>

18:35.349 --> 18:37.916
<i> For even as the defenders</i>
<i> of law and order</i>

18:37.918 --> 18:40.485
<i> descend</i>
<i> on Gotham Central Station</i>

18:40.487 --> 18:43.654
<i> the Riddler shows up</i>
<i> on the other side of the city.</i>

18:43.656 --> 18:46.323
<i> At the mansion</i>
<i> of Mr. Van Jones</i>

18:46.325 --> 18:50.360
<i> famed fancier</i>
<i> of old silent films.</i>

18:50.362 --> 18:52.929
Well, come in.

18:53.697 --> 18:57.533
Mr. Riddler, at last.

18:57.535 --> 18:58.267
Yeah.

18:58.269 --> 19:02.170
I have it right here,
Mr. Van jones.

19:02.172 --> 19:04.706
My silent masterpiece.

19:04.708 --> 19:09.210
The only silent movie
ever made of Batman and Robin

19:09.212 --> 19:10.511
in action.

19:10.513 --> 19:13.146
I can hardly wait.

19:14.248 --> 19:16.315
Oh.

19:16.317 --> 19:16.715
Imagine.

19:16.717 --> 19:22.520
The first silent epic film
in almost four decades..

19:22.522 --> 19:23.254
...mine.

19:23.256 --> 19:27.825
What a triumph
for a collector like myself.

19:27.827 --> 19:29.994
But, come on,
let's run it.

19:29.996 --> 19:31.662
Come on.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.490
Sensational, Mr. Riddler.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.793
Worth every penny
of the $100,000

20:04.795 --> 20:06.327
I contracted to pay you.

20:06.329 --> 20:08.729
I thank you,
Mr. Van Jones.

20:08.731 --> 20:12.432
Just a moment, I'll put
this film in the safe.

20:12.434 --> 20:14.133
And get you your check.

20:14.135 --> 20:16.602
Would you excuse me?

20:27.779 --> 20:32.282
Have no fear for the safety
of your epic, Mr. Riddler.

20:32.284 --> 20:34.417
I'll keep it with my others.

20:34.419 --> 20:37.219
In this burglar-proof vault.

20:37.221 --> 20:41.723
It can be opened by
positively no one

20:41.725 --> 20:43.224
but myself.

20:43.226 --> 20:45.226
Mr. Van Jones..

20:45.228 --> 20:49.330
...why are you like a clock
at midnight?

20:49.332 --> 20:50.230
Answer.

20:50.232 --> 20:55.702
'Cause both your hands
are going straight up right now.

20:55.903 --> 20:57.203
What is this?

20:57.205 --> 21:01.173
This is your last reel.

21:01.175 --> 21:02.674
'Step aside.'

21:02.676 --> 21:04.509
But my films!

21:04.511 --> 21:06.377
You can't take them.

21:06.379 --> 21:07.578
They're priceless.

21:07.580 --> 21:11.281
Oh, I think
we'll find a price..

21:11.283 --> 21:14.917
'...when you try
to ransom it back.'

21:15.618 --> 21:17.418
This way, partners.

21:21.222 --> 21:22.655
No sheriff, Riddler baby?

21:22.657 --> 21:24.456
'Hos, he went that-a-way..

21:24.458 --> 21:27.158
...to the train station.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.192
Hurry it up, boys.

21:28.194 --> 21:32.229
Clean out that safe
and let's head for them hills.

21:34.599 --> 21:37.467
Blazes!
A bat shadow.

21:38.469 --> 21:40.770
Same old ending, Riddler.

21:40.772 --> 21:42.338
It never fails.

21:42.340 --> 21:45.774
Thought you had us fooled with
your double-dealing clues, huh?

21:45.776 --> 21:47.909
"The Great Train Hold-Up."

21:47.911 --> 21:51.712
The most famous silent
film ever made.

21:51.714 --> 21:53.914
'And the only existing print'

21:53.916 --> 21:57.517
is right here
in the Van Jones safe.

21:57.519 --> 21:59.285
Get him, boys.

21:59.287 --> 22:02.821
Get him, or we'll never
make it to the border.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.347
Good heavens!

22:37.921 --> 22:39.254
Call Chief O'Hara, Robin.

22:39.256 --> 22:42.457
Tell him we have the entire cast
right here.

22:42.459 --> 22:44.892
Cast?

22:44.894 --> 22:47.427
You're about to star
in a picture

22:47.429 --> 22:49.562
of your very own, Riddler.

22:49.564 --> 22:51.897
A long picture.

22:51.899 --> 22:54.966
Titled, "Up The River."

23:02.208 --> 23:04.241
Alfred, why are you
dawdling so?

23:04.243 --> 23:06.209
We're gonna be late
at the restaurant.

23:06.211 --> 23:09.045
- Is that so, madam?
- Well, of course it's so.

23:09.047 --> 23:12.449
We're due to meet Dick
and Bruce there at 8:00.

23:12.451 --> 23:15.151
As you say, madam.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.019
Alfred..

23:18.021 --> 23:21.187
...really,
and on my birthday too.

23:21.189 --> 23:25.024
Dick and Bruce promised they'd
have a big surprise for me.

23:25.026 --> 23:28.961
And that's precisely what I
shouldn't wish you to miss.

23:32.064 --> 23:35.032
- Happy Birthday, Mrs. Cooper.
- Many happy returns.

23:35.034 --> 23:38.969
Merciful heavens to Betsy,
it's Batman and Robin.

23:38.971 --> 23:41.905
My friend Bruce Wayne contacted
me through the commissioner.

23:41.907 --> 23:45.008
He said you'd always wanted
to meet the Dynamic Duo.

23:45.010 --> 23:47.477
'Kind of like a birthday
surprise, Mrs. Cooper.'

23:47.479 --> 23:51.214
- It's an honor, ma'am.
- And a pleasure too.

23:51.216 --> 23:53.950
May we take the liberty?

23:55.952 --> 23:58.119
- I think we better run, Batman.
- That's right, Robin.

23:58.121 --> 24:00.355
We'll be late for that
appointment we have tonight.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.723
Happy birthday again,
Mrs. Cooper.

24:01.725 --> 24:04.892
Quickly, let's race
to the Batmobile.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.796
Oh, Alfred.

24:09.798 --> 24:11.798
Alfred, imagine.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.599
They kissed me.

24:13.601 --> 24:18.503
Will Bruce and Dick ever believe
that when I tell them?

24:18.505 --> 24:20.004
Oh, I'm sure they will.

24:20.006 --> 24:23.841
After all, I was a witness.

24:23.843 --> 24:25.742
Madam.
