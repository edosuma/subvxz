WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.309
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.409 --> 00:10.778
I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE BOOKS UP THERE.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.117
I'M GOING BACK
TO TRAINING NEXT WEEK
FOR THE OLYMPICS,

00:16.217 --> 00:19.120
AND IF YOU TRY TO STOP ME,
YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.522
RIGHT, YOU'LL GO
TO YOUR FATHER'S.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.358
ONLY HE'S IN MIAMI
PHOTOGRAPHING SUPERMODELS

00:24.458 --> 00:26.194
AND NO ONE CAN GET
AHOLD OF HIM.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.761
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.398
- SHUT UP.
- Olivia: SEE, HE HASN'T
EVEN CALLED HER

00:30.498 --> 00:31.865
IN OVER A MONTH.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.367
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT YOUR FATHER

00:33.467 --> 00:35.436
DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF?

00:36.970 --> 00:39.340
I HAVE TO GO.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.809
WHAT ABOUT
OUR AGREEMENT?

00:41.909 --> 00:43.211
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
NEXT WEEK, OKAY?

00:43.311 --> 00:44.645
NO, WE WON'T TALK
ABOUT IT NEXT WEEK.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.147
WHAT ABOUT
OUR AGREEMENT?

00:46.247 --> 00:49.550
I WON'T TRY AND KILL
MYSELF AS LONG AS
I'M IN THERAPY.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.085
OKAY.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.963
- YES?
- AFTERNOON.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.799
$12 PLEASE.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.336
- FOR WHAT?
- PIZZA.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.004
A PIZZA?
I DIDN'T ORDER A PIZZA.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.374
OH, IS THERE
ANOTHER ENTRANCE
TO THE HOUSE?

01:13.474 --> 01:15.509
YEAH, BUT I'M SURE
NOBODY ORDERED A PIZZA.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.611
OKAY, BUDDY.
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

01:17.711 --> 01:21.415
UH, CANDY? CAN YOU CHECK
THE STREET NUMBER ON THE
ROBINSON STREET ORDER?

01:21.515 --> 01:24.285
Candy:
Yeah, it's, uh--
848 Robinson.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.420
YEAH, BUT THE JOHN
CLAIMS HE DIDN'T
ORDER A PIE.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.056
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME TAKE IT.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.325
I THINK I KNOW
WHO IT'S FOR.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.161
YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S GONNA TAKE
THE PIE.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.296
What do you mean?
Suddenly he did order it?

01:35.396 --> 01:38.666
- Ask him what's on it.
- YOU GOTTA TELL ME WHAT'S
ON THE PIE FIRST.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.335
I CAN'T JUST
BE HANDING OVER
ANOTHER MAN'S PIZZA.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.006
IT'S...

01:46.106 --> 01:48.509
- CHEESE.
- AND...?

01:48.609 --> 01:52.513
- AND...
- AND IT'S DEEP-DISH.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.283
- YEAH, IT'S DEEP-DISH, YEAH.
- OH, YEAH.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.785
- HOW MUCH IS THAT?
- IT'S $12.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.487
THANKS.

01:59.587 --> 02:02.623
- AND... HERE YOU GO.
- OH, THANK YOU.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.493
- IT'S FOR YOU.
- THANKS A LOT.
TAKE CARE. BYE.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.797
( theme music playing )

02:25.613 --> 02:27.348
WANT SOME?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.617
NO, I'M OKAY, THANKS.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.555
I WAS ON THE BUS
AND I REALIZED I HAVEN'T
HAD ANYTHING TO EAT.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.825
SO I SENT A TEXT MESSAGE
TO GOOGLE FROM MY PHONE,

02:37.925 --> 02:40.761
THEY SENT ME
BACK THE NUMBER
OF THIS PLACE NEAR YOU.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.430
GOOGLE CAN DO THAT?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.565
GOOGLE CAN DO ANYTHING.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.968
- ( chuckles )
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT SOME?

02:48.068 --> 02:49.603
I THINK THIS PLACE
IS TOTALLY ORGANIC.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.906
NO NO NO.
HONESTLY, I'M SURE.
I HAD LUNCH ALREADY.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.008
- HOW IS IT?
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.177
NOT THE BEST,
BUT I HAVE TO EAT.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.413
I NEED THE CALORIES.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.054
HOW WAS YOUR WEEK?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.323
GOOD, THANKS.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.525
SO YOU'RE
IN A GOOD MOOD?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.494
I THINK SO.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.231
DO MY MOODS
WORRY YOU?

03:17.331 --> 03:19.767
YOU WERE A LITTLE
GRUMPY LAST WEEK.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.871
YOU SORTA
ATE ME ALIVE.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.940
WELL, THERE WERE
A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT
I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR

03:27.040 --> 03:31.111
AND IF I CAME ACROSS
AS IMPATIENT OR ABRUPT, I--

03:31.211 --> 03:34.382
I APOLOGIZE.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.318
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.719
WERE YOU HAVING
A BAD WEEK?

03:38.819 --> 03:41.355
YEAH.

03:41.455 --> 03:45.192
AND... MAYBE SOME
OF THAT SPILLED OVER

03:45.293 --> 03:48.095
INTO THIS--
INTO THIS ROOM.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.797
IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.
I WISH IT DIDN'T.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.500
RELAX,
I CAN TAKE IT.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.369
- OKAY.
- PLUS I LIKE
THAT SIDE OF YOU.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.971
- WHICH SIDE?
- THE NO-BULLSHIT SIDE.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.973
MMM.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.042
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAID

04:02.142 --> 04:04.912
"I NEED THE CALORIES"?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.048
I'VE LOST
SOME WEIGHT.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.718
WHEN YOU GO BACK
INTO TRAINING WITH
WEIGHTS AND STUFF,

04:10.818 --> 04:13.321
AS YOU BUILD UP
MUSCLE, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO GAIN WEIGHT

04:13.421 --> 04:15.222
BECAUSE MUSCLE
WEIGHS MORE THAN FAT.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.190
OH. NEVER KNEW THAT.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.561
WHEN I'M NOT HERE,
DO YOU JUST BURY YOUR HEAD
UNDER A ROCK OR SOMETHING?

04:20.661 --> 04:23.864
SO THESE POUNDS
THAT I'VE PUT ON,

04:23.964 --> 04:25.466
THEY COULD BE--
THEY COULD BE MUSCLE,
REALLY.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.701
DO YOU GO
TO THE GYM?

04:27.801 --> 04:29.870
OCCASIONALLY.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.206
YOU HAVE TO DO IT
CONSISTENTLY IF YOU
WANNA SEE RESULTS.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.108
EVERY DAY.
WEIGHTS AND CARDIO.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.209
NO PAIN,
NO GAIN, GUY.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.812
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.748
AND YOU CAN'T SEE MUSCLE
IF IT'S BURIED UNDER FAT,

04:40.848 --> 04:43.751
SO YOU HAVE TO CUT BACK
ON YOUR SUGAR AND CARB INTAKE.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.486
OKAY, COACH.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.821
- SORRY.
- NO, I APPRECIATE
THE TIP, THANKS.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.823
ANYWAY,

04:49.923 --> 04:51.925
IF YOU BUILD MUSCLE,
YOU'LL GAIN WEIGHT,

04:52.025 --> 04:54.728
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU'RE A PHYSIOLOGICAL
FREAK LIKE ME.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.465
SINCE I'VE
STARTED LIFTING WEIGHTS
I'VE LOST TWO POUNDS,

04:57.565 --> 05:00.734
WHICH IS LIKE
ANATOMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

05:00.834 --> 05:04.071
NOW CY WON'T LET ME LIFT
UNTIL I GAIN IT BACK.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.607
IT'S BULLSHIT, REALLY.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.443
HE WAS LIKE,
"YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU EAT PROTEIN

05:09.543 --> 05:13.714
AFTER EVERY SESSION,
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOUR FAT-CARB RATIO--

05:13.814 --> 05:15.282
BLAH BLAH BLAH..."

05:15.383 --> 05:17.451
HE WEIGHED ME
TWO DAYS AGO.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.953
I DON'T KNOW HOW,
BUT I LOST ANOTHER POUND.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.864
- CAN I EAT HERE?
- SORRY?

05:30.964 --> 05:32.900
I NEVER ASKED IF IT WAS
OKAY FOR ME TO EAT HERE.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.203
SURE, OF COURSE IT IS.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.838
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE
ALL THESE RULES,

05:37.938 --> 05:40.073
AND I WASN'T SURE
IF THERE WAS A RULE
ABOUT FOOD.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.411
WHAT ARE MY RULES?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.380
WELL...

05:46.480 --> 05:48.315
THERE WAS A NO-SUICIDE RULE
THAT WE MADE LAST WEEK.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.350
I THINK THAT WAS MORE
OF A PACT, BUT--

05:50.451 --> 05:53.921
IF IT WAS A PACT,
WE'D BE DRINKING POISONED
KOOL-AID TOGETHER.

05:57.825 --> 06:01.328
AND WHEN I HAD
THE CAST, YOU HAD THAT RULE
ABOUT NOT UNDRESSING ME.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.831
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S SO MUCH A RULE.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.934
I-- I FELT THAT
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.370
SO THERE ARE
NO RULES.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.973
I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.409
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID,

06:15.509 --> 06:18.145
BUT YOU CAN
DEFINITELY EAT.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.681
IT MAKES ME HAPPY
TO SEE YOU EAT...

06:21.348 --> 06:23.417
WITH GUSTO.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.987
A LOT OF GUSTO,
ACTUALLY.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.470
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I'M DONE.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.606
I DON'T WANT ANYMORE.
IT'S A LITTLE DISGUSTING.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.608
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS GOOD.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.277
I SAID IT WAS OKAY.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.813
- MMM.
- I'M NOT HUNGRY ANYMORE.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.047
OKAY.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.917
I HAD HALF A SLICE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.753
FINISH THE WHOLE THING?
WHO COULD FINISH A WHOLE
SLICE OF PIZZA?

06:59.853 --> 07:02.055
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO COULD FINISH.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.757
FAT PEOPLE.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.665
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT "GUSTO" MEANS?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.301
OF COURSE,
IT MEANS--

07:14.401 --> 07:16.737
IT MEANS IT'S HOW
FAT PEOPLE EAT.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.907
WITH GUSTO.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.141
DID YOU KNOW

07:21.241 --> 07:25.579
A FAT PERSON
WHO ATE WITH GUSTO?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.049
NOT EXACTLY.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.286
WHAT--
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.756
MY FATHER HAD
THIS GIRLFRIEND...

07:35.856 --> 07:39.660
A MODEL.
SHE HARDLY SPOKE ENGLISH

07:39.760 --> 07:42.362
AND HE DIDN'T SPEAK ITALIAN.
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.766
SHE USED TO TURN UP
AT HIS APARTMENT WITH BAGS
OF CHOCOLATE.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.400
SHE KEPT TRYING
TO FORCE-FEED ME.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.402
WHEN I WOULDN'T DO IT,

07:49.503 --> 07:52.372
SHE TOLD MY DAD
I WAS ANOREXIC.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.141
SHE WENT AROUND
THE HOUSE

07:54.241 --> 07:55.909
POINTING TO ME
AND SAYING,

07:56.009 --> 07:59.479
( mock-Italian accent )
"I AM SO WORRIED FOR HER.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.549
SHE HAS NO GUSTO
FOR EATING."

08:01.649 --> 08:04.818
MEANWHILE SHE'S STUFFING
HER BONY ASS LIKE A PIG

08:04.918 --> 08:06.854
AND NEVER GAINING
ANY WEIGHT.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.190
SHE WAS A TOTAL MIA.
MY DAD NEVER SAW IT.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.760
HMM.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.797
WHAT?

08:18.465 --> 08:20.601
YOU CAN SAY IT.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.003
I'VE HEARD IT
A THOUSAND TIMES BEFORE.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.308
YOU THINK I HAVE
AN EATING DISORDER.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.310
WHY CAN'T ANYBODY
UNDERSTAND?

08:30.410 --> 08:32.279
THIS IS JUST
THE WAY I'M BUILT.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.381
I DON'T GET HUNGRY.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.817
I CAN GO A WHOLE DAY
AND NEVER GET HUNGRY.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.286
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M ANOREXIC.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.854
I'M AN OLYMPIC HOPEFUL,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.456
I KNOW WHAT MY BODY IS
AND ISN'T CAPABLE OF.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.126
I KNOW MY BODY
BETTER AT 16

08:46.226 --> 08:48.195
THAN REGULAR PEOPLE
EVER WILL.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.903
NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.874
SHE STARVED
TO DEATH HOPEFULLY.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.710
I DON'T KNOW.

09:02.810 --> 09:06.714
HE NEVER STAYED
WITH ANY OF THEM
FOR VERY LONG.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.817
AND WHEN SHE TOLD HIM
THAT SHE THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD

09:09.917 --> 09:12.653
AN EATING DISORDER,
DID HE TAKE HER SERIOUSLY?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.487
I DON'T KNOW.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.290
- DID HE TRY
TO GET YOU TO EAT MORE?
- NO.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.227
HE LIKES ME
FOR MYSELF,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.929
AND HE LOVES
HOW I LOOK.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.732
HE SAID IF THE WHOLE
GYMNASTICS THING
DOESN'T WORK OUT,

09:24.832 --> 09:27.067
HE CAN GET ME
A JOB AS A MODEL...

09:27.167 --> 09:28.636
LIKE THAT.

09:32.706 --> 09:35.042
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT?

09:35.142 --> 09:37.344
I LOVE IT.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.680
I LIKE BEING
LIGHT AND THIN.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.749
I LIKE FEELING
THAT I COULD JUST
SLIP AWAY

09:41.849 --> 09:44.084
THROUGH A CRACK
IN THE DOOR
IF I HAD TO.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.518
MMM.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.756
CAN YOU THINK OF A TIME
WHEN YOU USED YOUR...

09:48.856 --> 09:52.693
LIGHTNESS,
AS YOU CALL IT,
TO SLIP AWAY?

09:52.793 --> 09:56.129
I'M DESCRIBING
A FEELING, PAUL.
DON'T BE SO LITERAL.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.698
OKAY.
FAIR ENOUGH.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.833
WELL, CAN YOU THINK
OF A TIME THEN

09:59.933 --> 10:04.071
WHEN YOU THOUGHT,
"I WISH I COULD JUST
SLIP AWAY"?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.239
HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

10:08.075 --> 10:11.712
THAT PARTY--
WHERE THE BOY
TOOK YOU INTO THE--

10:11.812 --> 10:15.649
INTO THE BEDROOM.
DIDN'T YOU WANT TO
SLIP AWAY THEN?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.686
I WAS TRASHED.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.357
- YOU DON'T GET IT.
- WHAT DON'T I GET?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.127
THE SLIPPING AWAY THING.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.262
IT'S--

10:29.362 --> 10:30.798
IT'S A GIRL THING,

10:30.898 --> 10:33.834
THE WANTING
TO BE LIKED.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.903
TO BE THERE,
BUT NOT TO BE THERE.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.806
IT'S LIKE--
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

10:38.906 --> 10:40.407
FINISH THE THOUGHT,
SOPHIE.

10:40.507 --> 10:44.144
NO. I WANNA TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.546
OKAY.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.916
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT THEN?

10:52.519 --> 10:54.121
HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

10:54.221 --> 10:56.757
ROSIE? SHE'S--

10:56.857 --> 10:58.726
SHE'S FINE, THANK YOU.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.061
IS SHE STILL
WITH THAT FUCKED-UP GUY?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.196
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO TALK
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER

11:03.296 --> 11:05.866
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.571
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT HER IF YOU DON'T.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.273
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T
I WANNA TALK ABOUT HER?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.408
YOU NEVER MENTION HER.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.884
YOU KNOW, AFTER
YOU LEFT LAST WEEK,

11:23.984 --> 11:26.754
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING
ABOUT HOW YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

11:26.854 --> 11:28.621
THAT YOUR DAD
WAS IN MIAMI.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.758
WE'RE BACK
TO THAT?

11:30.858 --> 11:33.693
SO HE STILL
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT
YOUR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE?

11:33.794 --> 11:35.729
I DON'T WANNA TALK
ABOUT THIS.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.965
IS IT SOMETHING
YOU WANNA KEEP
A SECRET FROM HIM?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.767
IT'S NOT
A FUCKING SECRET.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.702
HOW CAN IT BE
A SECRET IF THAT'S
ALL YOU AND MY MOM

11:42.803 --> 11:45.072
AND EVERYONE ELSE
CAN TALK ABOUT?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.351
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

11:58.451 --> 12:01.154
NOTHING.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.524
I HAVE A TEST TOMORROW
THAT I HAVE TO STUDY FOR

12:04.624 --> 12:07.127
AND I MISSED MY DENTIST
APPOINTMENT TODAY, SO I HAVE
TO RESCHEDULE THAT.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.662
I THINK
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.865
- WHAT?
- MM-HMM.
IN YOUR MIND,

12:11.965 --> 12:13.566
YOU'RE PLANNING
YOUR SCHEDULE.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.869
WE GET CLOSE
TO SOMETHING

12:15.969 --> 12:18.371
THAT FEELS
DANGEROUS TO YOU,

12:18.471 --> 12:20.640
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?
YOU RETREAT.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.843
I'M NOT RETREATING.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.745
I'M STRESSED ABOUT
THE EXAM, I THINK
I HAVE A CAVITY

12:25.846 --> 12:28.248
AND I HAVE A STOMACHACHE
FROM THAT FUCKING PIZZA.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.582
WHAT A MISTAKE
THAT WAS.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.551
WELL...

12:31.651 --> 12:33.653
I HAVE A THEORY
ABOUT THAT PIZZA.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.688
SURPRISE SURPRISE.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.324
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HEAR IT?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.827
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.862
YEAH. YOU ALWAYS
HAVE A CHOICE.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.332
WHAT'S YOUR THEORY?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.701
I THINK THAT YOU
WERE ENJOYING THAT PIZZA

12:48.802 --> 12:51.604
UNTIL I SAID SOMETHING
THAT REMINDED YOU

12:51.704 --> 12:55.442
OF SOMETHING
YOUR FATHER'S GIRLFRIEND
USED TO SAY TO YOU.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.179
I USED THE WORD
"GUSTO."

12:59.279 --> 13:01.448
ARE YOU SAYING
I'M FUCKED UP ABOUT FOOD

13:01.548 --> 13:03.650
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
MY FATHER'S GIRLFRIEND SAID?

13:03.750 --> 13:06.219
ARE YOU FUCKED UP
ABOUT FOOD?

13:06.319 --> 13:07.821
ISN'T EVERYBODY?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.292
WHAT DOES FOOD
MEAN TO YOU?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.127
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.096
WELL, IS IT NUTRITION,
IS IT ENJOYMENT,

13:16.196 --> 13:18.598
IS IT--
IS IT-- WHAT?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.533
IT'S THE ENEMY.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.103
MMM.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.339
IT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS
TO GYMNASTS.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.477
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR FATHER WAS IN MIAMI?

13:30.577 --> 13:31.578
WHY WAS IT
A SECRET?

13:31.678 --> 13:33.914
IT'S NOT
A FUCKING SECRET.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.583
I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT I NEED TO BOTHER HIM

13:36.683 --> 13:37.951
WITH EVERY BORING
DETAIL OF MY LIFE.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.420
YOUR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE
IS A BORING DETAIL?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.089
IT'S NOT
A SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.157
I WAS JUST TESTING.
REMEMBER?

13:44.257 --> 13:46.994
SOMEBODY AROUND HERE
HAD THAT THEORY, I THINK.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.229
YEAH, THAT RINGS A BELL.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.870
HE'D PUT IT TOGETHER
AND DECIDE THAT IT'S
ALL YOUR FAULT.

13:56.970 --> 14:00.373
HE ALREADY THINKS
YOU'RE A QUACK, REMEMBER?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.975
IT'S BETTER FOR YOU
IF HE DOESN'T FIND OUT.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.576
HE'LL NEVER LET ME
COME BACK HERE.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.245
IS IT BETTER FOR YOU
OR BETTER FOR ME?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.281
WHICH OF US WOULD HAVE TO
STAY AWAY FROM THERAPY,
DO YOU THINK?

14:08.381 --> 14:11.718
IF HE KNEW,
HE'D BE DEVASTATED.

14:11.818 --> 14:15.155
HE IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON TO ME
IN THIS WHOLE WORLD.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.091
I DON'T EVER
WANNA HURT HIM.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.493
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST LET IT GO?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.597
FORGET IT.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.199
THIS IS SUCH
A WASTE OF TIME.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.101
YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF, SOPHIE,

14:28.201 --> 14:31.972
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON
IN YOUR WORLD?

14:32.072 --> 14:33.873
HE HAS A LIFE!

14:33.974 --> 14:35.542
SOMEBODY HAS TO.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.945
WE CAN'T ALL GO AROUND
LIKE WALKING CORPSES.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.913
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
THAT I TOOK THOSE PILLS!

14:40.013 --> 14:41.949
I'M NOT SAYING
IT IS HIS FAULT,

14:42.049 --> 14:43.550
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

14:43.650 --> 14:45.919
WHY YOU WERE SO READY
TO LEAVE THE PLANET
AND NOT TELL HIM.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.387
WHAT'S UP YOUR ASS?

14:47.487 --> 14:48.922
ARE YOU ANGRY
AT HIM FOR SOMETHING?

14:49.022 --> 14:50.390
I'M NOT ANGRY AT HIM.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.259
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

14:52.359 --> 14:54.394
GET OFF MY BACK!

14:56.496 --> 14:58.031
OKAY.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.504
ARE WE DONE?

15:05.805 --> 15:07.574
WE HAVE
A LITTLE TIME LEFT.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.484
WHAT?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.053
WELL, YOU--

15:20.153 --> 15:22.689
YOU'VE NEVER WANTED
TO END A SESSION
EARLY BEFORE.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.296
IN OUR FIRST SESSION

16:03.396 --> 16:05.898
YOU MENTIONED
THOSE BOOKS UP THERE.

16:05.999 --> 16:09.102
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU IDENTIFIED WITH THEM.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.670
YOU SAID THEY WERE

16:10.770 --> 16:14.407
COLD AND LONELY
ON THE TOP SHELF.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.110
AND THEN I LOOKED
AT THEM MORE CLOSELY
AND I REALIZED

16:17.210 --> 16:18.878
THAT ONE OF THEM HAS...

16:18.978 --> 16:21.348
SOME OF YOUR FATHER'S
PHOTOGRAPHS IN IT.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.951
YOU SAID
THAT YOUR DAD

16:25.052 --> 16:28.421
LOVES THE WAY
THAT YOU LOOK,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.990
AND THAT...

16:31.091 --> 16:34.727
IF YOU WEREN'T A GYMNAST
THAT YOU COULD BE A MODEL.

16:37.264 --> 16:40.400
I GUESS MODELS ARE
THE PEOPLE THAT HE--

16:40.500 --> 16:42.802
THAT HE CHOOSES
TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.438
THE PEOPLE HE--
HE LIKES.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.351
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE HE FUCKS.
I WOULDN'T SAY HE LIKES THEM.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.891
I KNOW THAT
IN OUR CULTURE
THIN MODELS ARE--

17:04.991 --> 17:09.262
ARE SEXUALIZED,
BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOUND
THAT REALLY STRANGE,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.664
BECAUSE IN CLASSICAL ART
AND LITERATURE,

17:11.764 --> 17:15.001
EATING IS OFTEN USED
AS A METAPHOR FOR SEX.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.003
THEY BOTH CONJURE UP

17:17.104 --> 17:19.172
DESIRE, HUNGER...

17:19.272 --> 17:22.109
CRAVINGS INSIDE US.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.313
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
SOPHIE?

17:26.413 --> 17:28.748
SOPHIE, TRY TO
STAY HERE, PLEASE.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.351
TRY NOT TO DISAPPEAR.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.087
EAT SHIT, PAUL.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.591
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

17:40.026 --> 17:41.894
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.863
WHY DOES
THE BOOK PROVOKE

17:43.963 --> 17:45.898
SUCH A STRONG
REACTION IN YOU?

17:45.998 --> 17:48.401
WHAT YOU'RE
DOING IS SICK.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.371
IT'S FUCKING SICK.
IT'S PERVERTED.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.373
I'LL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS.

17:53.473 --> 17:57.076
WHY? BECAUSE I'M MAKING
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

17:57.177 --> 17:58.978
I'M ASKING YOU
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS

17:59.078 --> 18:00.647
THAT YOU DON'T
REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.216
IF I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT MY FATHER'S BOOK,

18:03.316 --> 18:05.518
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
IT WAS RIGHT THERE.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.555
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT CRAP
ABOUT A PATIENT DECIDING
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.923
THAT YOU TAKE THINGS
AT MY SPEED,

18:11.023 --> 18:13.760
AND I CONTROL
THE WHEELS AND ALL THAT?
YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.563
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN DRIVING
WHAT WE TALK ABOUT HERE.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.898
YOU MAY NOT REALIZE IT,
BUT YOU HAVE.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.569
THE VERY FIRST THING THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
WERE THOSE BOOKS UP THERE.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.070
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

18:24.171 --> 18:26.539
THAT YOU JERK OFF
TO MY FATHER'S PHOTOGRAPHS?

18:26.639 --> 18:30.310
THAT YOU OPEN UP
THAT BOOK AND JERK OFF
ALL OVER THOSE SLUTS?

18:30.410 --> 18:33.045
YOU KEEP SUGGESTING
SOMEBODY IS ABUSING ME.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.847
YOU'RE ABUSING ME.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.016
THAT'S WHAT YOU PEOPLE
LOVE MOST OF ALL, ISN'T IT?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.785
A GOOD MINDFUCK.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.321
TO TAKE THE ONE GOOD THING
IN SOMEBODY'S LIFE

18:41.421 --> 18:42.889
AND SOMEHOW FUCK IT UP.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.791
JUST LIKE
MY FATHER SAID.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.165
SHUT THE FUCK UP
ABOUT HIM!

18:58.238 --> 19:00.273
HOW COULD YOU?!

19:00.373 --> 19:03.476
HOW COULD YOU?!
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE!

19:04.177 --> 19:05.912
LIKE WHO, SOPHIE?

19:08.181 --> 19:09.782
SOPHIE.

19:11.050 --> 19:14.387
PLEASE, DON'T GO.
PLEASE.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.557
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

19:53.293 --> 19:55.828
YOU MEAN WHY DID I TAKE
THE BOOK DOWN?

19:58.365 --> 19:59.799
BECAUSE I HAD TO.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.736
I HAD TO PUT THE BOOK
ON THE TABLE...

20:03.836 --> 20:07.640
AND THERE WAS
REALLY NO GRACEFUL WAY
OF DOING IT, SOPHIE.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.680
I THINK THIS BOOK IS
CONNECTED TO YOUR WOUND.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.285
AND OPENING A WOUND,
SOPHIE, IS--

20:18.385 --> 20:21.053
IS FRIGHTENING,

20:21.153 --> 20:23.890
IT'S-- IT'S PAINFUL

20:23.990 --> 20:26.659
AND IT'S--
AND IT'S UGLY.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.002
YOU IMPLIED THAT I'D BEEN
SEXUALLY ABUSED.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.571
IS THAT WHAT YOU HEARD?

20:38.671 --> 20:41.541
I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.813
THIS BOOK WITH THE--

20:46.913 --> 20:49.316
WITH THE NAKED MODELS...

20:50.683 --> 20:52.885
YOU WANTED ME
TO SEE THAT.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.859
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

21:02.562 --> 21:04.631
I THINK YOU'RE ANGRY.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.302
I THINK YOU'VE
GOT GREAT ANGER
TOWARDS YOUR FATHER.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.740
YOU SAID EARLIER ON
THAT YOU WISHED

21:13.840 --> 21:16.943
THAT YOU COULD SLIP
THROUGH THE CRACKS
WHEN YOU WANTED TO,

21:17.043 --> 21:20.313
BUT YOU DON'T DO THAT
WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,
SOPHIE. NOT REALLY.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.015
YOUR MIND TRIES TO,
BUT YOUR BODY--

21:23.115 --> 21:25.552
YOUR BODY STAYS HERE.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.254
YOU LET OTHERS
DO THINGS TO YOU,

21:28.355 --> 21:30.657
BECAUSE YOU'VE CONVINCED
YOURSELF THAT--

21:32.291 --> 21:34.427
THAT YOU'RE NOT
REALLY THERE...

21:36.363 --> 21:38.831
THAT IT'S NOT
HAPPENING TO YOU.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.233
THAT IT'S NOT--

21:41.334 --> 21:42.902
THAT IT'S NOT
HURTING YOU.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.806
I'M SURE THIS WEEK
YOU'RE GONNA EXERCISE
LIKE A FIEND.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.041
AND NOT BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN OLYMPIC HOPEFUL...

21:51.611 --> 21:53.880
BUT BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT AFTER THIS SESSION,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.548
YOU'RE GONNA WANT...

21:56.349 --> 21:58.751
TO REGAIN CONTROL.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.790
BUT I WANT YOU TO
REMEMBER SOMETHING, SOPHIE.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.258
WHEN YOU GO UP
ONTO THAT BEAM,

22:06.359 --> 22:09.596
THAT'S THE PLACE
WHERE YOU DETACH.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.599
THAT'S WHERE
YOU GO TO FEEL SAFE.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.437
ALL I WANT YOU TO KNOW
IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.674
THERE ARE OTHER PLACES
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL SAFE.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.044
AND HERE,
IN THIS ROOM...

22:26.613 --> 22:28.715
IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES.

23:46.325 --> 23:49.862
( theme music playing )
