that exact same tactic.

You know what I mean?
The sand and all that beautiful...

04:52.358 --> 04:53.825
- Dude.
- Sorry.

Sorry, I was just reminiscing.
That's how I proposed to my second wife.

04:59.899 --> 05:02.834
She was a fat-ass, though.
She looked nothing like Ashley.

- I'm doing the right thing.

to imagine my life without you.

15:40.539 --> 15:43.736
Hey, nigga, we gotta ride.
We gotta go to the stizzore.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.436
Mom ain't got enough flizzour
and the stizzore closes in an izzour,

15:46.545 --> 15:47.842

15:47.947 --> 15:49.471
Can't be riding around here

16:23.082 --> 16:25.209
Oh, that's where the big homie got shot.

16:25.317 --> 16:29.447

16:33.292 --> 16:36.784
Oh, snap.

sometimes seeing how long the fuck
I can lay around without doing shit.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.426

17:12.531 --> 17:14.556
Hey, man, light this shit and roll it

You're good?

18:10.489 --> 18:13.253

(DOOR CLOSING)

18:44.823 --> 18:46.085

18:46.191 --> 18:49.592
Hey, Michael.
Did you guys have a good time?

18:50.095 --> 18:51.892
- You could say that.
- Okay.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.555
What happened to June Bug?

18:54.266 --> 18:58.362
- June Bug is at T-Bone's.
- JENKINS: Not T-Bone.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.838
- Well, you know what that mean.
- Degenerate.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.310
Ashley, come help me

19:06.478 --> 19:09.242
Thanks for bringing

19:09.348 --> 19:11.839

- Sorry.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.049

19:16.622 --> 19:21.457
Hey, Michael, come go with me.
I wanna show you something in the den.

19:22.528 --> 19:23.620
Sure.

19:23.962 --> 19:28.956
Oh, Jesus Christ. I have the hardest
goddamn time getting off this couch.

19:29.067 --> 19:32.594
My wife put all this plastic. Oh, Jesus.

19:33.639 --> 19:37.336
Shit. Goddamn hot mix.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.109
Is this you and Huey?

19:47.219 --> 19:50.518
Yeah, that's me and Huey
marching on City Hall.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.352
That picture in the corner,

19:56.461 --> 19:58.554
- At a march?
- No. No.

19:59.631 --> 20:04.364
In the Bahamas on a vacation.
Here you go. Drink up, young blood.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.541
That's mother's milk, right there.

20:15.647 --> 20:19.447
Oh, no. That's a man's drink, right there.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.584
Look, young blood,
I brought you down here

20:25.691 --> 20:28.057
'cause I wanna rap with you for a taste.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.691
I dedicated 30 years of my life
to the Movement.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.528
Fighting oppression

20:37.202 --> 20:42.139
at the hands of a cold-blooded,
ruthless oppressor. You understand?

20:43.175 --> 20:46.736
Back in the day,
I was a high-ranking soldier in the Party.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.511
You understand?

20:50.616 --> 20:54.609
And I didn't raise my daughter
to be with the very motherfucker

20:54.720 --> 20:57.484
that I used to fight with on the streets.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.717
Who murdered and killed
a lot of my comrades in the line of duty.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.462
But I want you to know,

21:09.067 --> 21:13.401
that I will kill you
before I let you be with my daughter.

21:14.406 --> 21:15.896
You understand?

21:17.743 --> 21:19.608
ASHLEY: Hey, guys, come and eat.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.878
Come on, let's eat.
I think we're having pork chops. Come on.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.445
I know you like pork chops.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.582
ASHLEY: Did you like it, honey?
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah.

21:33.692 --> 21:36.217
- I told you my mama's cooking was good.
- Good food, baby.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.523
- You want something else to drink?
- No, I'm fine, baby.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.597
I'm licking the plate.

21:40.232 --> 21:44.692
Mom, I'm not gonna lie to you.
This food's off the hinges.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.567
Got my stomach bubbling
and everything. Great.

21:47.673 --> 21:50.039
- Yeah, I missed your cooking, Mama.
- Oh, thank you.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.837
- It was great, baby.
- Thank you.

21:51.943 --> 21:55.879
I gotta hand it you, Mrs. Jenkins,
that was a delicious meal.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.848
Well, I am so glad you enjoyed it, Michael.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.712
You didn't finish your pork chop, Michael.

22:04.289 --> 22:06.416
Well, you know, I don't eat pork.

22:11.463 --> 22:12.896
You don't what?

22:16.335 --> 22:19.202
- I just don't eat pork.
- What kind of nigga don't eat pork?

22:19.304 --> 22:21.067
What type of nigga?
You point one out and show me.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.435
ASHLEY: June Bug, why don't you
just leave him alone?

22:22.541 --> 22:23.974
You don't smoke no weed,
you don't eat no pork.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.873
JUNE BUG: What kind of nigga
don't eat pork? What's wrong?

22:25.977 --> 22:27.569
You one of them Mussolinis
or something?

22:27.679 --> 22:31.672
- Muslim. I'm not. And I'm not, but...
- You trying to correctionalize me?

22:31.917 --> 22:34.112
- You try to correctionalize me?
- JENKINS: June Bug?

22:34.786 --> 22:36.310
- Oh, I get it. I get it.
- ASHLEY: I'm sick of this.

22:37.723 --> 22:40.317
A pig that don't eat pig.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.717
Oh, Jake.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.989
Dad, I used to be getting your jokes.
I don't really...

22:45.097 --> 22:46.496
I don't get that one. What do you mean?

22:46.598 --> 22:51.467
Your sister Ashley here,
has brought a pig into our family.

22:51.903 --> 22:55.669
This motherfucker right here, June Bug,
is one-time.

22:56.975 --> 23:00.308
You a police officer? You got me...
You got me riding around with this cop?

23:00.412 --> 23:02.607
Why did you have to tell him that?

23:03.048 --> 23:06.347
Okay, okay, this has gone too far.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.186
- You a one-time?
- This has gone too far.

23:09.287 --> 23:12.120

the cops go home. Relax, all right?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.317

23:32.978 --> 23:35.606
- Okay, hold on!
- Daddy, stop!

23:36.114 --> 23:38.309
Wait a minute. Now, stop, Daddy.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.209
Come on, don't be upset.

23:43.221 --> 23:46.281
My father and brother are just like that.
You know?

23:46.725 --> 23:49.125
- What, this is normal for you?
- No.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.496
I just know how they are, you know?

23:53.832 --> 23:56.232
Especially my dad, you know, he's just...

23:56.334 --> 23:59.394
I don't know.
He's just real stuck in his ways.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.730
Yeah, I can see that. Shit.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.283
And chop that up in your head a little bit.

25:24.456 --> 25:27.391

38:55.199 --> 38:58.999
My family is my family, but you're my boo,
my husband to be.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.806
Nobody's gonna come in between that.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.166
Love conquers all.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.080
Isn't that what you told me
the night of our engagement?

39:11.582 --> 39:12.913
I love you.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.384
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:17.588 --> 39:19.146
Hold that thought.

39:30.901 --> 39:33.893
ASHLEY: Hey, Monster,

39:34.004 --> 39:37.633
How you doing, baby? I heard you was

39:37.742 --> 39:40.142
- Okay.

39:40.244 --> 39:42.474
This is my boyfriend, Mike.

39:47.251 --> 39:49.981

39:50.087 --> 39:52.317
Nice to meet you... Monster, it was?

39:52.423 --> 39:54.414
Yeah, Mr. Monster.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.517
Mr... That's cool.

39:58.162 --> 40:01.893
You know what? I've always had a crush
on you, you know that, right, sweetheart?

40:01.999 --> 40:04.866
- Let me just get my arm out.
- Yeah, you told me.

40:06.504 --> 40:09.837
Did you and Ashley go to school together
or something?

40:10.708 --> 40:13.768
You know what? You look better
than you did last time I saw you.

40:13.878 --> 40:14.902
Thank you.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.503
MRS. JENKINS: Ashley, can you come
give me a hand real quick?

40:17.615 --> 40:20.709
- Gotta go, thanks.
- Yeah.

40:22.453 --> 40:25.752
- You know, I was...
- Hey, man, shut your punk ass up.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.992
I'll spit all over you, you hear me?

40:29.160 --> 40:32.061
- Where you from?
- San Diego.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.030
- No, I said what set you from?
- Set? I don't follow you.

40:35.132 --> 40:36.531
You know what I mean, nigga.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.966
What set, what hood,
what gang you from?

40:39.103 --> 40:42.766
Gang... Oh, no, no, no, I'm not...
Hold it. Just give me a little room.

40:42.873 --> 40:45.137
I'm not into all that.
I'm just not into all that.

40:45.242 --> 40:47.608
- What are you into?
- Actually I'm a...

40:48.045 --> 40:50.275
You... What was that word
you were about to say?

40:50.414 --> 40:55.078
Come on, come on, say it, say it,
or I'm gonna beat your ass, say it!

40:57.087 --> 40:58.054
MICHAEL: Cop.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.858
Help. Help.

41:04.628 --> 41:07.426
Let him go, let him go, Monster,
let him go.

41:07.531 --> 41:09.294
No, this is your last day on Earth, cop.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.767
One-time killed my brother.
You gonna die today, pig.

41:19.376 --> 41:23.676
- Daddy? Monster, he tripping again.
- I'm gonna bust your ass up, too, bitch.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.280
What did I tell you?
What did I tell your big ass?

41:30.387 --> 41:32.651
Not to step foot
in my goddamn house again.

41:32.756 --> 41:34.053
Motherfucker!

41:34.158 --> 41:36.251
Bust your ass again
like I did the last time.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.691
I was just leaving, Mr. Jenkins.

41:37.795 --> 41:41.026
You'd better!
Before I pop another cap up in your ass.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.528
Big son of a bitch.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.040
You all right?

41:51.342 --> 41:53.708
Yeah, I'm fine,
he started choking me by surprise, I...

41:53.811 --> 41:55.403
Not you, asshole.

41:55.846 --> 41:57.677
I'm talking to my daughter.
You all right, baby?

41:57.781 --> 42:00.215
I'm fine, Daddy. I'm fine.

42:02.453 --> 42:05.115
And you're supposed to be
a goddamn cop.

42:10.928 --> 42:13.021
The shit I do for your love.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.128
You hungry?

42:20.604 --> 42:22.629
So, your dad really wanted you
to marry this Malik guy?

42:22.740 --> 42:23.832
Yeah.

42:24.508 --> 42:28.376
I mean, his dad and my dad,
they were both in the Party together.

42:28.479 --> 42:31.915
And it kind of seemed like
the perfect match, you know?

42:33.784 --> 42:36.446
- Up until he robbed that bank.
- What?

42:36.921 --> 42:41.255
Yeah, he's been in jail
for the past five years.

42:42.326 --> 42:45.386
- How much time did he get?
- Quadruple life.

42:46.263 --> 42:49.391
And this is the man
your dad wanted you to marry?

42:49.800 --> 42:50.892
Yeah.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.268
I love you, Ashley.

42:54.371 --> 42:58.432
But I ain't robbing no banks
for your ass or your daddy's approval.

43:01.779 --> 43:02.973
Ashley.

43:07.484 --> 43:10.146
Don't forget where you are, young lady.

43:10.387 --> 43:13.049
Now, this thing came in the mail
for you today.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.123
- What is it?
- Some kind of tape.

43:17.127 --> 43:21.393
Didn't have a return address on it.
Why not pop it in and see what's on it?

43:32.376 --> 43:36.472
Come on, baby, break this up right here,
let's make a little space.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.221
I can never get comfortable on this couch.

43:50.494 --> 43:52.257
<i>Where'd that come from?</i>
<i>They don't even serve corn in here.</i>

43:52.363 --> 43:54.661
Look, baby, it's Malik.

43:57.568 --> 44:00.230
<i>Hey, baby. It's Malik.</i>

44:00.337 --> 44:02.396
Daddy, do we have to watch this?

44:02.873 --> 44:05.068
<i>How come you block all my calls</i>
<i>at every residence you move to?</i>

44:05.175 --> 44:07.666
Ashley, let's just watch it
and see what he has to say,

44:07.778 --> 44:09.473
it might be something really nice.

44:09.580 --> 44:12.310
<i>And return all my letters. Unread.</i>

44:14.318 --> 44:16.582
<i>I just thought</i>
<i>maybe you want to holler at a nigga.</i>

44:16.687 --> 44:18.712
<i>Thanks to this new videogram program,</i>

44:18.822 --> 44:21.188

44:41.812 --> 44:45.646
<i>Them motherfuckers float over my head</i>

44:45.749 --> 44:48.684
<i>Plus, Daddy just wanna make sure</i>

44:48.786 --> 44:51.914
<i>Me? I'm cool, you know what I'm saying?</i>

44:52.022 --> 44:55.253
<i>Long as there ain't no crooked cop</i>
<i>trying to assassinate me.</i>

44:55.359 --> 44:56.758
<i>Getting shanked by a nigga.</i>

44:56.860 --> 44:59.886
<i>Motherfucker trying to... You know,</i>

44:59.997 --> 45:03.592

45:15.279 --> 45:17.042
<i>Other than that,</i>

45:17.548 --> 45:21.609
<i>prison's been a positive,</i>
<i>positive experience.</i>

45:23.787 --> 45:28.053
<i>I never told you what went wrong</i>
<i>with the "alleged" bank robbery.</i>

45:28.392 --> 45:33.261
<i>You know, it wasn't the "alleged" bank</i>
<i>robbery that got me quadruple life, no.</i>

45:34.264 --> 45:38.928
<i>It was the amount of explosives</i>
<i>and arsenic they found at the crib.</i>

45:39.203 --> 45:41.467
<i>They tried to charge me</i>
<i>with a terrorist act.</i>

45:41.572 --> 45:43.472
<i>I ain't no motherfucking terrorist!</i>

45:43.574 --> 45:47.533
<i>I don't fit the motherfucking description,</i>
<i>George Bush, boy!</i>

45:48.846 --> 45:51.406
<i>Anyway, I just opened up 'cause,</i>

45:51.515 --> 45:56.919
<i>I guess it's my institutionalized way</i>
<i>of saying I'm sorry.</i>

45:59.923 --> 46:02.687
<i>You knows, what we had, baby,</i>
<i>was special.</i>

46:03.727 --> 46:07.322
<i>You remember that time,</i>
<i>your high school prom,</i>

46:07.431 --> 46:09.023
<i>when I came to pick you up?</i>

46:09.133 --> 46:11.294
<i>And everybody like, "Who the fuck</i>

46:11.401 --> 46:14.268
<i>"You know, coming to grab</i>
<i>a little shorty," right?</i>

46:14.371 --> 46:16.669
<i>Like I was some kind of child molester</i>
<i>or some shit.</i>

46:16.774 --> 46:18.571
<i>You know what I'm saying? Remember</i>
<i>I bust caps in the air,</i>

46:18.675 --> 46:20.233

46:20.344 --> 46:23.313
<i>All right, I took you down</i>

46:37.161 --> 46:39.561
<i>I don't think about you.</i>
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

46:39.663 --> 46:44.225
<i>When I'm shanking the shit out of a</i>
<i>motherfucker, I'm thinking about you, girl.</i>

46:45.469 --> 46:47.994
<i>Yeah, when I'm squirting the motherfucker</i>
<i>with lighter fluid</i>

46:48.105 --> 46:52.007

46:55.145 --> 46:57.272
<i>I'm thinking about you, girl.</i>

46:57.381 --> 47:00.782
<i>When I'm in this motherfucking cell,</i>

<i>Guilty, guilty, guilty.</i>

47:29.746 --> 47:31.873
<i>I'm thinking about you, girl.</i>

47:31.982 --> 47:34.610

<i>MAN: Guard, get in here.</i>
<i>He's doing it again. Guard?</i>

Cover's on the side of the couch,
Keystone Kop.

48:23.901 --> 48:28.463

- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

49:16.753 --> 49:21.850
- What about your daddy?
- What about him? I'm a big girl now.

49:25.195 --> 49:28.323
Big girls do big people things.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.465
Baby.

49:33.370 --> 49:35.998
- Really, we should...
- Should what?

49:36.106 --> 49:39.041
- We should keep this PG-13.
- Okay.

49:52.155 --> 49:54.646
- Baby, be gentle.
- I will.

49:57.227 --> 49:59.058
That's it.

(MUMBLING)

50:10.807 --> 50:12.502
Wake it up, asshole.

50:20.884 --> 50:23.352
It's breakfast.
You might want to put that thing away.

50:23.453 --> 50:27.082
'Cause we don't want no hard dicks
at the breakfast table.

50:34.931 --> 50:37.331

Okay, Michael,

Oh, great, okay, it's a pleasure

50:52.549 --> 50:57.282
No, baby, this is my mama's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Brown.

50:57.821 --> 51:00.051
Yeah, and you get that shit right.

51:02.626 --> 51:05.390
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Brown.

51:05.495 --> 51:09.955
- Glad to meet you, too, son.
- Very nice to meet you, Patrick.

51:11.601 --> 51:15.059
You'll have to excuse her,
she's a little senile.

51:15.205 --> 51:18.436
- What?
- No, no. It's okay, it's okay.

51:19.109 --> 51:21.339
He's a nice young man.

51:22.979 --> 51:26.881
Too bad you couldn't have met
a nice young man.

51:29.086 --> 51:31.111
Now I've said something to you before
about that shit.

51:31.221 --> 51:33.189
Don't come over here
and start no shit with me.

51:33.290 --> 51:36.453
- Not today, please, Papa.
- Come on, Papa, it's Thanksgiving.

51:36.560 --> 51:40.758
You need to shut up.
Your man ain't about shit, either.

51:40.864 --> 51:43.298
Your daddy about to get
his old light-skinned ass whooped.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.231

51:45.335 --> 51:49.965
Hey, hey!
Can't we just be civil for five minutes?

51:50.373 --> 51:52.364
This is Michael's first visit with us.

51:52.476 --> 51:55.104
You want the young man to think

51:55.212 --> 51:56.372
We is.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.075
Yeah, you're right.

52:01.218 --> 52:03.812
What is it you do for a living, Mike?

52:05.288 --> 52:07.347
Somebody pass me the bacon.

52:09.559 --> 52:11.356
I'm a police officer.

52:12.762 --> 52:15.287
- As in, "cop"?
- Yes.

52:16.466 --> 52:20.664
- Might be nice to have a cop in the family.
- MRS. BROWN: Wonderful.

52:21.204 --> 52:24.002

- MR. BROWN: Yeah, really.

52:24.774 --> 52:25.866
Yeah.

52:26.610 --> 52:31.013
I've got a couple of moving violations,
maybe you could kind of...

52:31.681 --> 52:35.014
We can talk about that later, you know,
'cause I don't do that for everybody.

52:35.118 --> 52:37.279
- Yeah, he doesn't really do that.
- It's really not...

52:37.387 --> 52:40.220
You know, we can talk about that later.

52:40.323 --> 52:42.621
JUNE BUG: Good morning, y'all, what's up,

Have a look at all the senior sexy in here.

52:53.036 --> 52:55.334

Bullshit! That's reefer I smell.

52:59.476 --> 53:03.606
You've been smoking reefer
without your granddad again?

53:06.950 --> 53:08.577
No, Grandpa, you know
I wouldn't do that to you.

53:08.685 --> 53:09.913
I saved you some.

53:10.620 --> 53:14.716
- Some of that biblical-type mind...
- Hey, hey, hey.

53:16.159 --> 53:19.822
Careful what you say now.
You know, we got the cops in here.

53:22.132 --> 53:23.997

53:30.073 --> 53:32.132
- Morning.
- Morning, neez.

53:32.542 --> 53:35.409
Kind of uncomfortable with me sitting
this close, ain't it? Shoulder to shoulder.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.503
You're used to me being in the back seat,
locked up, handcuffed.

53:37.614 --> 53:40.105
Do something now. Do something now!

53:40.684 --> 53:44.347
Anyway, before I was
so cop-fully interrupted...

53:45.055 --> 53:48.320
Later on, at the dinner we's having
tonight, the Thanksgiving one.

53:48.425 --> 53:51.883
Right, I was gonna announce my
engagement to Lupe, my mail-order bride,

53:51.995 --> 53:54.589
I got her over there from like Monte...
Like one of them old...

53:54.698 --> 53:56.598
She's like from places where they don't...

53:56.700 --> 53:58.634
You know, where they be speaking
other than what I say.

53:58.735 --> 54:01.602
Like I say this,
and they say something else.

54:03.773 --> 54:07.174
Unfortunately,
before we had a chance to...

54:07.744 --> 54:09.143
Consummate.

54:09.813 --> 54:12.077
- What, Mama? The word you told me...
- Consummate.

54:12.215 --> 54:16.845
Before we got a chance to get together,
she ran off with Hector, the gardener.

54:16.953 --> 54:18.045
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

54:18.154 --> 54:20.748
- MRS. BROWN: That dirty bitch.
- Mama.

54:22.092 --> 54:24.424
Talking about she was
more comfortable with him, you know,

54:24.527 --> 54:27.724
she says, you know,
she's all happy and stuff now probably.

54:27.831 --> 54:29.799
Keeping it pimping like Daddy.
That's what I'm gonna do.

54:29.899 --> 54:32.493
Keep it pimping like Daddy
from now on. I ain't... All that love shit...

54:32.602 --> 54:34.536
Like you said, Daddy,
after the motherfucking...

54:34.638 --> 54:36.401
"Ten years, fuck the bitch,"
remember that?

54:36.506 --> 54:39.236
Daddy was like, "After 10 years,
what the fuck I need her for?

54:39.342 --> 54:40.502
"Your mama barely got by,"

54:40.610 --> 54:41.872
you remember
you was me telling me about that.

54:41.978 --> 54:45.539
You were like, "She was cool,
but it wasn't the way..." You remember?

54:45.649 --> 54:51.588
Hey, you know, Ashley and I, we kind of
have an announcement of our own.

54:53.456 --> 54:56.584
- We've been dating for quite some time.
- You know what? I'm done eating.

54:56.693 --> 54:59.218
Yeah, I'm tired, too, man.
I'm feeling sleepy right now.

54:59.329 --> 55:00.796
Grandpa, you wanna go do that?

55:00.897 --> 55:03.195

MR. BROWN: Yeah, let's go do that.

waiting for the goddamn turkey,

I burned the whole goddamn turkey.

57:24.374 --> 57:27.810

Yeah, well, he hasn't,
he brought it up earlier.

57:40.924 --> 57:43.188
Which brings me to my next point.

57:43.560 --> 57:45.653
You see the way in which
my father treats you?

- Yeah, I see that.
- You don't like it, do you?

Never have.

57:53.036 --> 57:54.901

You're treating Michael
the same way, Jake.

- No, it ain't the same.
- Yes, it is.

No, it ain't. Goddamn it, it ain't.

You need to get over that.

this ain't coming from the same woman

with me and had the big-ass afro,

58:21.931 --> 58:23.489

to that damn Malik, then what?

- Quadruple life.
- Exactly.

what's up with you and Michael?

I mean, y'all talking marriage,
babies, or what?

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:29.888

- Well, I think he's a very nice young man.

- MOOKIE: I think he's a keeper.
- I think so, too.

aren't getting along, you know?

Sweetie-pie, you can't be
with who your daddy like.

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:43.964
Girl, I can't think of one boyfriend I had
that Daddy did like.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.268
The last one I had that he liked was Malik.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.936
- Now that ought to tell you something.
- Right.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:51.371
Is that boy still locked up?

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:55.610
- Four life sentences. I think so.
- Oh, goodness!

01:00:56.486 --> 01:01:00.183
Baby, you know when your
mama and daddy first got together,

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.592
I thought your daddy
was a real piece of shit,

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.560
but she up and married him anyway.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.993
- Thank you, Mama.
- You're welcome, baby.

like he's supposed to,

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:24.843
you know everything is all right.

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:28.443

on the one yard line.

01:01:44.467 --> 01:01:47.834
How in the hell do you drop the ball
on the one yard line?

- Damn.
- Boy.

in other people's houses.

he get that shit from.

01:01:57.513 --> 01:02:00.448
Probably from you, you ignorant ass.

- And what, punk?

off on your old, ancient, last-supper ass.

- Any time, junior.

and ask who's on fries, do you?

who's filling the motherfucking waffles?

Huh? No, no, no, you don't.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.426

who made the damn potatoe salad?

- Exactly my point.

we be eating every year?

the damn plastic bag

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:41.821
with the giblets still inside
the goddamn turkey.

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.218

Your ass is raw.

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:57.531
That's why I have to drink
this messed-up punch,

01:07:57.773 --> 01:07:59.673
to wash the shit down.

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.702
with this nonsense
you're bringing into my house.

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:24.012
Look, sir...

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:27.445
Tell the paramedics to come back.
They forgot somebody.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.511
How could you do this, Michael?
Somebody could have got killed.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.145
Baby, I just wanted
your family to accept me.

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:37.957
You said we would be together whether
you clicked with my parents or not.

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.190
I didn't care whether they liked you or not,
but now, I don't know.

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.162
Maybe we shouldn't be together.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.634
- No, Ashley, Ashley, don't...
- Wait, wait. Wait.

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:54.608
Just get your shit and get out.

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:19.428
I am truly disappointed.

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:45.275
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:49.848
Baby, we're about to hit rush hour traffic.
We got to go. Come on.

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:53.994
Tell me, Daddy,
why did you hate Michael so much?

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:59.192
- 'Cause the boy's a pig, Ashley.
- I mean, other than that.

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:02.598
What was so wrong with him?

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:04.035
He's a punk.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.834
The boy is soft.
I can't believe you can't see that.

01:19:07.943 --> 01:19:11.936
- Is that it?
- Yeah, I mean, what else is there?

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:13.537
Me being happy.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:15.782
And that makes you happy?

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:22.221
Staged robberies in my house
makes you happy?

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.357
No.

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:27.253
Me being with Michael makes me happy.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:32.930
I love everything about him. His laugh,

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:38.167
his personality, everything.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.966
But he's a pig, Ashley.
And you know how I feel about...

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:45.945
Daddy, it's not the '60s anymore. God!

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:51.684
Decent black men, proud black men
can be police officers.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:55.746
Well, I don't know anything
about that, Ashley, okay?

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:58.349
Isn't civil rights and equal opportunity

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.691
what you guys were fighting for
in the first place?

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:03.231
Yeah.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:07.659
Yeah, well, I'll say Michael
is a shining example of just that.

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:11.032
A proud black man
who wants to marry a black woman,

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:13.801
who just happens to be a police officer.

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:21.977
Daddy, if that's not an example
of freedom, then I don't know what is.

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:31.289
Ashley, baby, we gotta go.
We're running out of time. Let's go.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.152
Hey, Mike.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.922
Hey, man, I'm sorry to hear
about you and Ashley, you know.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.551
It's all right.

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:11.999
So, she is single now.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.362
Sorry, tough break.

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:18.537
Mike, you know how we do?
Take it one day at a time.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.339
You know what I'm saying?
Keep your head up...

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:23.673
Yeah, you know, I got divorced
a couple of years ago.

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:26.138
- Dude, it was rough.
- Really?

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:29.178
Yeah, but they say
the fourth one's the toughest.

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:33.686
You're just on your first, you know...
Keep your head up, dude. Fight the power.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:38.188
Mike, let me get him out of here.
Listen, take care of yourself,

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:40.557
talk to me, give me a call, whatever.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.651
You're good. I appreciate that.

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:42.730
- Cool?
- Yeah.

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:43.820
- You're sure?
- You're good.

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.194
- Let's go.
- She looks great.

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.234
Come on, White. Damn.

01:21:57.879 --> 01:22:00.177
Hey, young blood. How you doing?

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.520
What are you doing here?
I thought you hated me.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:13.725
Is there somewhere that
we can talk in private around here?

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:16.427
Yeah, yeah. You know, we could...

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.524
Right here.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:31.609
Have a seat, son.

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:37.308
Now, I came down here to rap with you
for a second,

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:41.217
'cause I didn't like what went down
back at the house.

01:22:41.323 --> 01:22:45.487
- Listen, Mr. Jenkins, I didn't...
- Let me finish, son. Let me finish.

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.719
Now,

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:52.058
to say that me and the pigs...

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:59.936
I mean, law enforcement, have an
unstable history is an understatement.

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:04.507
Not only was there
the alleged attempted murder

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:06.045
of a police officer,

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:09.682
but it's the fact that the pigs...

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:15.047
I'm sorry, the cops,

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.391
along with the Federal Government,

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.959
plotted to take my party down.

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:28.368
They infiltrated my organization
and caused dissension among the ranks,

01:23:29.738 --> 01:23:34.641
turning a lot of us into snitches,
dope fiends, pimps and hoodlums.

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:40.009
They would have you to believe
that my party was a gang.

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.449
We wasn't no gang.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:48.451
We had all kinds of beautiful programs
for the people in the community.

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:52.686
We had after-school programs,
we had free breakfast for the kids,

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.492
we registered our people to vote.

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:58.766
All we were trying to do
was protect our community.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.607
Thanks.

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:13.340
And my feeling for police officers
runs real deep.

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:20.080
But I came here to tell you

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.748
that my feelings for my daughter
run even deeper.

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:29.223
I see the way that she loves you

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.192
and I don't want to lose my baby girl.

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:38.305
So I came here to tell you

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:44.442
that I would be happy
to have you as a son-in-law.

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:50.178
As long as you don't stage no more
fake robberies in my goddamn house.

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:59.052
No more "Keystone Kop," "Shaft" shit,
you know?

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:04.294
All right, I won't fuck with you
about that no more.

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:10.198
I don't have to eat pork, do I?

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.603
Well, you know, I was always conflicted

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:15.437
about the pork issue
when I was in the Party.

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:18.273
I mean, pork ain't never killed nobody.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.773
Okay, no pork.

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.917
Hey, look, I just want to say

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:31.324
I'm sorry for being so hard on you.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:35.158
No, that... No, it's...

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:40.159
That's right. That's good enough
right there. That's about all I can handle.

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:42.031
Now fall back, now. Fall back.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:43.934
- Okay, no.
- All right.

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.275
- Who's in there?
- The interrogation room.

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:02.786
Hey, Daddy.

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:06.323
Why don't you and him
do your own little thing?

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:16.693
Love conquers all, right?

01:26:18.072 --> 01:26:20.267
Yeah, baby, yeah.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.681
- Chill that metro shit!
- Love conquers all.

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:55.299
<i>MICHAEL: So, there it is.</i>
<i>I finally got my wish.</i>

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:58.744
<i>Me and Ashley were married</i>
<i>in a small, quaint garden</i>

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:02.714
<i>in South Central,</i>
<i>and we lived happily ever after.</i>

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.812
<i>That is until Christmas at the Jenkins'.</i>

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:23.670
Due to some counseling, a good time
and a few cartons of cigarettes,

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:26.706
I'm able to correspond
with you once again.

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:31.211
Now, I just wanted to call

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:34.281
and congratulate you on your nuptials.

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:38.546
You know, with whatever mock-ass nigga
you about to marry.

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:41.383
Now, I ain't hating, you know,
I'm congratulating.

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.923
But you know what fucks with me?

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:46.585
Is the fact that you'll probably
never be able to see

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:48.958
that motherfucking slithering cobra.

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.554
You know how that helmet gets fatter

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:53.896
than a motherfucking fat-rat.

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:57.631
You know what I'm saying? You'll never
be able to see the creepy clingy,

01:27:57.739 --> 01:28:01.641
the bull's blow, the rat-a-tat-tat.

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:07.270
No, but on the real, you know,

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:09.680
congratulations on y'all
little wedding and shit.

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:11.809
You know, I ain't no hating.

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:13.752
Congratulating like a motherfucker.

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:16.881
There's enough pussy to go around.
Pussy everywhere.

01:28:16.991 --> 01:28:20.222
I know there's about 235 bitches
out there right now free to fuck

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:22.489
since I'm locked the fuck up.

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:26.499
Plus that little half a bitch, that midget,
you know what I'm saying?

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:29.035
Like to toss her around.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:34.507
But you was my favorite girl. Yeah.
Bonaventure. Bonaventure.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:37.473
Hey, on a real, though,

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:40.103
that little mock-ass
nigga you're with and shit,

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:42.614
you know, y'all coming out
of that motherfucking church,

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:46.084
you know, and they start throwing rice,
I hope that shit is rocks, bitch!

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.087
You know what I'm saying?
Fuck you, the priest,

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:51.283
your mama, all them motherfuckers
sitting there, whoever watching this bitch.

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.883
All y'all is some punk motherfuckers.

01:28:54.395 --> 01:28:56.693
Yeah. G-up!

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:02.200
Kiss my motherfucking ass, bitch.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:04.100
"You may now kiss the bride," bitch.

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:07.038
He kissing my dick, tell that nigga that.

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:10.204
What's that nigga's name?

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:12.706
Write me back, baby.

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:14.981
Write me back.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.455
Thinking about you, always.
