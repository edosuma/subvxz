WEBVTT

00:22.666 --> 00:23.916
Jack?

00:25.333 --> 00:29.208
Jack, you were
supposed to meet me
at the club for doubles.

00:29.291 --> 00:32.708
Those insurance fellas
clobbered me.

00:32.791 --> 00:34.833
You know, one day off
isn't gonna kill you.

00:36.791 --> 00:38.416
- Oh hey.
- Hey.

00:38.500 --> 00:42.041
I was just borrowing
Jack's Betamax.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.125
What happened?
Jack stood you up?

00:45.208 --> 00:47.666
Yeah. Have you seen him?

00:47.750 --> 00:50.083
- Hm, no.
- I called his house.

00:50.166 --> 00:53.666
I figured maybe inspiration
struck and he came here.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.541
Man's not really one
for a day off, you know?

00:55.625 --> 00:58.375
Hey, you're welcome
to take a load off.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.291
You can listen to me
get my 27 words in.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.083
- Twenty-seven, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:02.166 --> 01:04.666
Chick choked on his
vodka at commercial.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.333
- That sounds like
a divine intervention.
- Yeah, well.

01:07.416 --> 01:10.083
For a second there, I had
a whole flash of panic.

01:10.166 --> 01:11.583
I was like...

01:11.666 --> 01:13.041
what happens if
he drops dead?

01:13.125 --> 01:16.041
I mean, I'm gonna have to finish
the whole game on my own.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.291
The apprentice's dilemma.

01:18.375 --> 01:20.833
- What's that?
- It's a little...

01:20.916 --> 01:22.375
lecture I used to give.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.166
Well, I love a good lecture.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.625
You can I ask my wife.

01:25.708 --> 01:27.666
Let me get the tequila.
You want some?

01:27.750 --> 01:29.000
- Yeah, alright.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.916
Tudor England.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.166
The entire economy
split into two tiers.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.333
Apprentices and masters.

01:36.416 --> 01:38.875
The idea was that any
apprentice worth his salt

01:38.958 --> 01:41.458
is climbing up that ladder,
turns into a master

01:41.541 --> 01:43.250
when he comes of age.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.666
So, we're too old
to share an office?

01:45.750 --> 01:47.458
Not if you ask Hamlet. See,

01:47.541 --> 01:49.291
you got the whole of Denmark
telling this prince

01:49.375 --> 01:51.791
he's destined to be king.
But, you know what?

01:51.875 --> 01:53.833
He didn't want it.

01:53.916 --> 01:57.708
- He wasn't built for it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:57.791 --> 02:00.791
<i>I think that I spent, uh...</i>

02:00.875 --> 02:04.583
a very long time
feeling like a failure

02:04.666 --> 02:07.166
because the best thing
that I know how to do

02:08.125 --> 02:11.541
is help another guy be great.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.583
But what I'm starting to realize

02:13.666 --> 02:16.916
is that maybe...

02:17.000 --> 02:21.250
'tis better be a noble prince
than hapless king?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.750
Maybe I ought to read
more Shakespeare.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.875
Always.

02:24.958 --> 02:27.750
But that was
a Paul Westhead original.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.750
- Good one.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.333
Well, hello, Jack.

02:33.416 --> 02:34.750
- Cassie.
<i>...he's in ICU.</i>

02:34.833 --> 02:36.750
- Cassie, slow down.
- <i> It's Jack!</i>

02:36.833 --> 02:38.166
<i>Jack's in</i>
<i>the emergency room.</i>

02:38.250 --> 02:39.500
Okay, which hospital?

02:39.583 --> 02:41.208
<i>Little Company of Mary.</i>
<i>T-Torrance.</i>

02:41.291 --> 02:43.000
Yeah. Okay, I'll be right there.

02:44.416 --> 02:47.041
("My Favorite Mutiny"
by The Coup playing

04:14.916 --> 04:16.541
Your name.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.000
Most precious thing
you've got.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.708
That's why it's our job
to protect it.

04:21.791 --> 04:24.250
Keep it synonymous
with success,

04:24.333 --> 04:25.916
on the floor and off.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.083
And I can promise,
when folks see you
in our shoes, they'll say,

04:29.166 --> 04:32.166
"There goes
a Converse All-Star."

04:32.250 --> 04:34.083
"Adidas, the shoe
of champions."

04:34.166 --> 04:35.625
He's cool,
he's fun, and...

04:35.708 --> 04:37.958
- A quality fit. That's Puma.
- ...of course, he's rich.

04:38.041 --> 04:39.416
We need to think
about your feet.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.958
You need to think about
your pocketbook.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.375
- Your legacy.
- Your feet.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.458
You wanna be as American
as apple pie.

04:44.541 --> 04:45.666
That's the makings
of a legend.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.500
...and everyone
will want a piece...

04:47.583 --> 04:50.000
- ...Magic, Mr. Magic.
- The Magic Man!

04:50.083 --> 04:51.750
It's Earvin, actually.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.416
Not anymore! Earvin--

04:53.500 --> 04:55.708
- Earvin will be gone someday.
- Maybe he already is.

04:55.791 --> 04:56.958
Magic is immortal.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.333
If you choose wisely...

04:58.416 --> 05:00.125
- ...this could be...
- If you choose us...

05:00.208 --> 05:02.458
Right on the soles of
the next generation...

05:02.541 --> 05:04.375
- If you choose us...
- This could be

05:04.458 --> 05:06.875
- the most important
choice of your season.
- ...of your entire life.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.916
Well, uh... yeah.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.708
Thanks.
Got a lot to think on.

05:12.791 --> 05:14.625
- Take your time but,
just so you know...
- Sleep on it.

05:14.708 --> 05:17.916
- Just so you know,
Converse already has...
- ...a verbal commitment...

05:18.000 --> 05:19.708
- ...from your friend Larry Bird.
- ...Larry Bird.

05:21.833 --> 05:22.833
Oh.

05:22.916 --> 05:24.833
That's Magic Johnson!

05:27.000 --> 05:29.125
Hope you had your fill
of bullshit.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.458
Those guys keep on shoveling

05:30.541 --> 05:33.208
till you're just another
stallion in the stable.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.416
Phil.
Phil Knight.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.958
Hey, Phil. You...
you on the schedule?

05:38.041 --> 05:39.416
Me?
Heck no.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.333
Front Office seems to have you
under lock and key.

05:42.416 --> 05:43.708
Big dogs only.

05:43.791 --> 05:46.375
Fact is, I-I'm sort
of a rookie myself.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.250
Let me be straight as
an arrow with you, Earvin.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.750
C-can I call you Earvin?

05:49.833 --> 05:51.458
I wish somebody would.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.458
Good 'cause I'm an athlete, too.
Ran track at Oregon.

05:53.541 --> 05:56.833
Mediocre talent. Not like you.
But, my coach and me,

05:56.916 --> 05:59.208
my partner now,
we figured out a nifty trick.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.625
If we could shave just one ounce

06:00.708 --> 06:03.166
off of our shoes, it made us
55 pounds lighter every mile.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.666
You run an average
of three miles a game.

06:04.750 --> 06:07.916
Think how much faster
you would be without
any extra weight.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.541
What, you tellin' me
to play barefoot?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.666
I'm telling you to play...
in these.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.458
- Y'all making me a special pair?
- Every pair.

06:33.541 --> 06:36.666
The Nike Magic.

06:36.750 --> 06:39.916
A new label for
a whole new line.

06:41.833 --> 06:45.708
- Y'all talking to
Larry Bird, too?
- I'm talking to you.

06:45.791 --> 06:48.333
We need more than just
a smile on a poster.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.541
We need a partner.

06:52.208 --> 06:53.791
- How much we talking?
- You mean

06:53.875 --> 06:55.666
can I give you what those
other guys are offering.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.708
Where's that sitting right now?
Sixty, 70 grand a year?

06:58.791 --> 07:00.041
Eighty.

07:01.083 --> 07:04.500
Wow.
I'm offering a dollar.

07:04.583 --> 07:05.958
One for every pair we ship,

07:06.041 --> 07:07.833
plus 100,000 in stock options.

07:07.916 --> 07:10.000
Right now,
that's 18 cents a share.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.458
But the sky's the limit, Earvin.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.416
Bet on us,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.875
you're betting on yourself.

07:17.958 --> 07:19.500
Proposal's in the shoe.
Look it over,

07:19.583 --> 07:20.875
I'll be in town all week.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.708
Ah! Sign with us,
you get the right one, too!

07:40.041 --> 07:41.875
Oh, good lord.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.958
Is he...

07:48.625 --> 07:50.750
Oh, no! I mean, he...

07:50.833 --> 07:53.000
Wow, he looks really good.

07:53.083 --> 07:56.041
- Actually...
- Okay, let's go.
Let's go get some air.

07:56.125 --> 07:58.708
- Paul's here now.
- I'm here. I'm sorry.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.750
Hey, Cran, it's gonna be okay.

08:00.833 --> 08:03.291
- Come on, Cran.
Let's get some air.
- I'm here.

08:03.375 --> 08:06.083
Hey, I got this.
We're going to be fine.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.708
Goddammit, Jack.

08:22.791 --> 08:25.000
You were supposed to meet me
for tennis, man.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.500
- Okay.
- Good afternoon.

08:29.583 --> 08:30.625
Hi. Hey.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.791
- Are you family?
- Um, if you could...

08:32.875 --> 08:34.791
just give me
the information, please.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.000
Well, we were able
to dress his wounds,

08:37.083 --> 08:39.208
but the inflammation in his
brain is worrisome. Are...

08:40.375 --> 08:41.916
Are you authorized
to make decisions?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.333
- We may need to
discuss goals of care.
- Okay.

08:44.416 --> 08:46.083
My goal is to get him up
and walking out of here

08:46.166 --> 08:48.000
- as good as new, right?
- Of course.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.333
That's our north star,

08:50.416 --> 08:52.000
but an injury severe as this,

08:52.083 --> 08:55.083
sometimes, the discussion
moves to quality of life.

08:56.416 --> 08:59.875
Quality of life?
He's head coach of the Lakers.

08:59.958 --> 09:01.958
He's living his dr--
All he did was take a tumble

09:02.041 --> 09:04.666
- off of a goddamn bike!
- The trauma he's endured--

09:04.750 --> 09:06.250
It's not gonna happen!
If that's your attitude,

09:06.333 --> 09:08.291
we're going to need
another doctor. Just...

09:12.208 --> 09:15.250
That's Jack McKinney.
He's my best friend. So,

09:15.333 --> 09:17.291
what I need to hear from you

09:17.375 --> 09:19.625
is what you're gonna do
to fix him up

09:19.708 --> 09:21.791
because we have
a fucking game tomorrow!

09:41.500 --> 09:43.250
Well, well, well.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.208
- What do we have here?
- It's from the<i> signore.</i>

09:47.291 --> 09:49.083
It's on me, pal.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.958
Jack. You shouldn't have!

09:54.041 --> 09:56.333
I had to comp
his season tickets
to get him to do that.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.458
He's our biggest fan.
It's crazy.

09:58.541 --> 10:00.666
We got two seats
right next to him.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.458
Reserved for Great Western Bank.

10:02.541 --> 10:05.958
Hot damn!
The wife is gonna plotz.

10:06.041 --> 10:08.625
You know, Dr. Buss put
chairs right on the floor

10:08.708 --> 10:11.083
- because it's great
for television.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.041
Yeah. We don't pick
that up in Sacramento.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.125
All they pick up in Sacramento
is the clap,

10:15.208 --> 10:17.708
which, incidentally, is
exactly how this is spreading.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.458
<i>We're 13 games in.</i>

10:19.541 --> 10:20.791
<i>We got lightning in a bottle.</i>

10:20.875 --> 10:22.958
<i>We got a genius coach,</i>
<i>young phenom,</i>

10:23.041 --> 10:25.791
<i>coupled with the greatest</i>
<i>player in the league,</i>

10:25.875 --> 10:27.583
right here,
smack dab in the heart

10:27.666 --> 10:29.500
of the entertainment
capital of the world.

10:29.583 --> 10:30.875
Mr. Buss,

10:30.958 --> 10:32.833
we are a banking institution,

10:32.916 --> 10:34.250
and your loan
matures tomorrow.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.041
Though I presume from your
request to meet that we're here

10:37.125 --> 10:38.708
to talk about a payment plan.

10:38.791 --> 10:42.083
You're darn tootin'.
Frank, tell him our plan.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.958
We don't plan to pay.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.833
We're giving you an opportunity.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.583
The Lakers are the team
of the 1980s,

10:54.666 --> 10:57.541
and the Great Western Bank can
be the official banking partner

10:57.625 --> 10:59.583
of the Los Angeles Lakers.

10:59.666 --> 11:01.333
But we're gonna need
a continuation

11:01.416 --> 11:04.500
of the current loan through
June to the end of the season,

11:04.583 --> 11:06.000
plus a fresh line of credit,

11:06.083 --> 11:07.500
so we can keep investing
in the business.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.750
Together.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.125
And if we demand our money now?

11:13.208 --> 11:15.875
Well then, Mariani,
Buss, and Associates

11:15.958 --> 11:17.875
is going to file for bankruptcy.

11:17.958 --> 11:21.458
And you can take the two of us
for everything we got.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.458
Which, right now, is...

11:23.541 --> 11:25.250
I don't know, Frank,
what do we got?

11:30.458 --> 11:31.875
- $72.
- Oh,

11:31.958 --> 11:33.833
and this fine bottle of
bubbly. Don't forget that.

11:33.916 --> 11:37.541
And, of course, the team.
The team is worth plenty.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.416
N...ope!

11:39.500 --> 11:41.666
My mother is a genius,
by the way.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.125
My ex-wife wanted
something gold,

11:44.208 --> 11:46.166
so I gave her the team.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.250
All that's in her name now.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.125
So, you can shake us down
and come up with pocket lint,

11:52.208 --> 11:54.750
or you can dig down deep

11:54.833 --> 11:56.791
into those fancy suits you got,

11:56.875 --> 11:59.000
try to find the balls

11:59.083 --> 12:01.208
to stay in business
with the Lakers.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.541
And then, my friends,

12:02.625 --> 12:05.875
that bank is gonna raise
a statue of you two

12:05.958 --> 12:08.375
right there in downtown
Sacramento someday.
Trust me.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.083
Listen, I'd love
to stay and chitchat,

12:10.166 --> 12:12.666
but I have a very horny
22-year-old upstairs

12:12.750 --> 12:13.875
just waiting for me. So,

12:13.958 --> 12:16.375
take our projections,
spend the day with them,

12:16.458 --> 12:19.041
and then come to
the club tonight
and tell us we got a deal.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.750
The Jacksons are gonna
pack that place.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.833
But don't worry.
We got your comp tickets.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.083
Listen,

12:24.166 --> 12:26.625
it's clear skies
from here on out.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.291
Pleasure doing business
with you. Frank.

12:33.666 --> 12:35.250
Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.625
You think
they're gonna go for it?

12:36.708 --> 12:38.250
Of course, they're
gonna go for it.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.333
They'd be fools not to.
We got 'em by
the short and curlies.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.166
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Claire?

12:42.250 --> 12:44.083
- What are you doing here?
- I'm waiting for you.

12:44.166 --> 12:45.500
On my day off.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.166
Was supposed to be at
the zoo with my grandson,

12:47.250 --> 12:49.916
- but there's a problem
with food and beverage.
- What's that?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.500
- There isn't any.
- Fuck.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.041
He hears me on the phone.
Kid's like a parrot.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.916
The deliveries were never made
because your bookkeeper

12:55.000 --> 12:57.750
sent bad checks
to all my vendors.

12:57.833 --> 13:00.125
- None of the vendors
have been paid?
- No.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.083
Th-th--
This is an old account.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.041
She's an old bookkeeper.

13:10.166 --> 13:12.416
<i>I was telling Earvin</i>
<i>that it is some luck</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:15.666
<i>that you're in town.</i>
<i>You know, your head</i>
<i>for business.</i>

13:15.750 --> 13:17.416
These shoe companies
are comin' at him

13:17.500 --> 13:20.791
pretty hard for
an endorsement deal.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.041
I can imagine.
Promise you the world.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.125
The question is,
will they deliver?

13:25.208 --> 13:27.000
Yeah.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.041
Whole lot of numbers, but...

13:29.125 --> 13:32.666
Have you been talking to anybody
else about this? A professional?

13:32.750 --> 13:36.125
Um, Pops got Mr. Bowman
outta D-Town.

13:36.208 --> 13:39.000
He's a fine attorney
for a Michigan attorney.

13:40.291 --> 13:41.416
And for this?

13:41.500 --> 13:44.041
Don't know his dick
from a doorknob.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.500
Guess you could say
the same thing about me, too.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.916
I wouldn't.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.166
Look ...

13:53.250 --> 13:54.916
Let me pose a question

13:55.041 --> 13:57.500
that I pose to all
my clients, okay?

13:57.583 --> 14:00.750
Five years, 10 years, 50.

14:00.833 --> 14:04.166
What do you want
out of your future?

14:07.708 --> 14:09.250
Um...

14:09.333 --> 14:11.625
everything.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.833
Okay. That's big business.

14:13.916 --> 14:15.541
Something for everybody.

14:15.625 --> 14:16.708
Kinda like Coca-Cola.

14:16.791 --> 14:18.208
That's right! Yeah! Just--

14:18.291 --> 14:19.625
That's exactly what
I'm talking about!

14:19.708 --> 14:21.375
Good, so now we know what
we building here, right?

14:21.458 --> 14:23.708
- Our promised land.
- Right.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.416
We need our 10 Commandments.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.375
Pitfalls to avoid.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.625
Choices that
Earvin might make

14:29.708 --> 14:32.416
that would be bad
for Magic Johnson.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.875
You ain't gotta worry
about that with me.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.166
I don't drink none,

14:40.250 --> 14:42.958
and I don't touch
that narcotic either.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.375
- Some Coca-Cola for you.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.208
And women?

14:53.750 --> 14:56.375
You gotta be smarter.

14:57.375 --> 14:58.708
Quieter.

14:58.791 --> 15:01.416
Keep everybody happy.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.250
- Want another cup, Pops?
- Better not, baby girl.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.166
The jet-lag is
beating me down. So,

15:11.250 --> 15:14.125
why don't I take a closer
look at these, Earvin?

15:14.208 --> 15:17.083
You know, we could talk
at the game tomorrow.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.250
Cindy here has promised me
some good seats.

15:19.333 --> 15:22.208
You see, my man
takes care of family.

15:22.291 --> 15:25.208
Yeah. Hey, Doc, actually,
you d-- you don't gotta...

15:26.416 --> 15:29.458
It's not a problem
at all. Trust me.

15:29.541 --> 15:31.375
- Let's go.
- You got everything, Dad?

15:31.458 --> 15:33.333
I do, sweetheart.
Walk me out.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.250
- Ma!

15:47.333 --> 15:49.791
No, no, no! Don't close that!

15:49.875 --> 15:51.208
- Ma!

15:51.291 --> 15:54.041
- Oh my god, my god...
- How bad is it?

15:54.125 --> 15:55.958
- Move this.
We need to get...

15:56.041 --> 15:58.000
- Dad! Sorry!
I couldn't hear you!
- The hell is going on?

15:58.083 --> 16:01.375
- If that's Gerald,
tell him to get in here!
- I can't smell it.

16:01.458 --> 16:04.375
- Smell what!?
- She doesn't know
the smell of death.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.958
- I do. Don't close that door!

16:07.041 --> 16:09.875
There's something
rotting in the walls!

16:09.958 --> 16:11.583
You put me in here with vermin!

16:11.666 --> 16:13.375
- No! Leave that open!
- Ma. What are you doing?

16:13.458 --> 16:14.958
- We need the air!
- There's no smell!

16:15.041 --> 16:17.000
Nonsense!
Gerald, get all this down!

16:17.083 --> 16:19.208
- It's up here! I know it!
- Will you forget about that shit

16:19.291 --> 16:20.375
and look at these?

16:20.458 --> 16:21.708
You paid all the vendors

16:21.791 --> 16:24.041
with checks from Crocker!

16:24.125 --> 16:27.416
Ma, we left Crocker
five years ago!

16:27.500 --> 16:29.458
You're the one who
closed the account!

16:31.166 --> 16:35.500
Oh, well, there we have it.
Blame it on me. That's rich.

16:35.583 --> 16:39.041
We'll just write new checks.
We'll sort all of this out.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.583
- What is this?
- What?

16:51.541 --> 16:52.666
This.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.833
Mom, this is the transfer
of ownership paperwork.

17:01.583 --> 17:03.750
They were supposed to be filed
with the state a month ago, Ma.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.750
I know that.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.833
Then what is it doing
in my fucking hand?

17:10.666 --> 17:13.541
The loan is due tomorrow!

17:13.625 --> 17:16.208
And now, these fucking bankers
have me over a barrel,

17:16.291 --> 17:17.750
and they're gonna take it all!

17:17.833 --> 17:20.708
No, I don't understand!
I don't understand.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.625
- I don't understand
what he's saying!

17:23.708 --> 17:25.375
- You're okay.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.541
- Hello?

17:27.625 --> 17:28.625
Hey, Bill.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.166
- I know.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.125
What?

17:32.208 --> 17:34.000
Bill, what hospital are you at?

17:34.083 --> 17:36.458
I'm coming. I'm coming. Okay.
Clean this place up

17:36.541 --> 17:38.125
and take care of her.
I have somewhere to be.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.958
- It's gonna be okay.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.916
- Dr. Buss.
- Hey, Bill. There you are.

17:51.541 --> 17:53.583
- So?
- He's still under the knife.

17:53.666 --> 17:55.416
Shit.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.583
- How long has he been in there?
- I don't know.

17:57.666 --> 18:00.000
He came in as a John Doe.
Cranny found him here.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.625
The fuck was
he doing on a bike, Bill?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.333
It clears his head.
It clears--

18:04.416 --> 18:06.250
Gentlemen.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.041
Jack is just out of surgery.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.166
- Bob Kerlan, team physician.
- Hey, Bob.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.875
Sorry to meet under
these circumstances.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.583
He's out of surgery? Sorry.
He's, uh, he's awake?

18:14.666 --> 18:16.041
Oh, I certainly hope not.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.083
The top of his skull
is sitting in a freezer.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.166
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.958
- Fuck.
- Well, just temporarily.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.083
They'll pop it back on
once the swelling

18:24.166 --> 18:25.250
in his brain goes down.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.125
- Is he gonna make it?
- You said it was temporary.

18:28.208 --> 18:31.791
Well, everything is,
but the next few hours
will be crucial.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.375
I'll be on call. Bill.

18:34.458 --> 18:35.625
Bob.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.458
- I should call them the league,
talk about postponing--
- No!

18:40.541 --> 18:42.583
Do not call anybody.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.625
- What do we tell the press?
- Nothing.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.708
- We don't need
anybody panicking.
- But what happens

18:46.791 --> 18:49.541
- when Jack's not in
the locker room tomorrow?
- Bill...

18:49.625 --> 18:52.750
you tell them he fell off
his fucking bike.

18:52.833 --> 18:54.666
'Cause that's
the truth, isn't it?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.208
- Yeah.
- Alright. So, listen to me.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.291
This is the exact words
you're gonna use.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.000
"We are erring on
the side of caution."

19:02.083 --> 19:03.458
You tell the same thing
to the players.

19:03.541 --> 19:06.500
Pete, you're coaching
the game tomorrow.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.166
- Paul.
- Huh?

19:08.250 --> 19:10.208
Um, wrong apostle.
Um, you said Pete, my name--

19:10.291 --> 19:12.958
Hey, hey. Get your
head outta your ass.

19:13.041 --> 19:16.166
- Can you coach
the goddamn game or not?
- No.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.000
Yes. Sure.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.083
Look, I do the scouting,
I do the prep work anyway,

19:20.166 --> 19:22.375
so I can probably
coach one game.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.166
Dr. Buss,
we should discuss this.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.041
Don't lose.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.041
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

19:35.125 --> 19:36.666
Easy?

19:37.416 --> 19:39.166
I'm fucking cursed.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.458
Yeah, but nobody knows.

19:40.541 --> 19:42.000
- Not yet!
- Right!

19:42.083 --> 19:44.500
So, by the time the suits from
the bank find out about this,

19:44.583 --> 19:46.541
we're gonna have it signed,
sealed, delivered, right?

19:46.625 --> 19:48.541
Unless they walk in here now

19:48.625 --> 19:51.208
- and see you l-like this.
- Got a bad feeling, Frank.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.041
Come on. Look at me.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.083
Look at me.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.375
You're Gene Kelly.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.833
Y-you're Fred Astaire, man.

19:58.916 --> 20:00.750
You're Ginger Rogers.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.166
So, tonight,

20:02.250 --> 20:04.666
tonight, you gotta do what?

20:09.916 --> 20:11.666
Okay.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.791
I'm gonna put on my taps
and I'm gonna dance.

20:13.875 --> 20:16.791
That's right, baby.
Dance your heart out.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.208
Hey now!
You didn't say
this was a fruit bar.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.083
A fruit bar!

20:22.166 --> 20:23.791
How about that Michael?
He can sure boogie, huh?

20:23.875 --> 20:25.625
He's just the appetizer, boys.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.708
You're about to have
the main course.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.166
Welcome to the Forum Club.
Come on in!

20:49.458 --> 20:50.750
You put that up your nose?

20:50.833 --> 20:53.750
Not this. You smoke it.
No more sniffles.

20:53.833 --> 20:56.291
This'll make you feel like
you can fix the world.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.958
- Have a little taste.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.833
Uh, no thank you.
We're from Lansing.

21:03.916 --> 21:06.833
Shit, the only thing
Country touches is Coca-Cola.

21:06.916 --> 21:08.625
You already know what
my answer's gonna be.

21:08.708 --> 21:11.000
- I'll stick with yoga.
- Yeah, hell no.

21:11.083 --> 21:12.583
- Man, keep that shit
away from me.
- I thought so.

21:12.666 --> 21:15.000
Spencer is a vegetarian.

21:17.666 --> 21:20.125
Vegetarian?
So he don't eat pussy?

21:22.416 --> 21:25.416
So you must be Magic Johnson,
teeth that white.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.166
Richard Pryor, man!

21:27.250 --> 21:29.375
I was at the studio
where they shot "Car Wash."

21:29.458 --> 21:31.458
Hey, Young Buck's
about to be on TV, too.

21:31.541 --> 21:34.791
- About to be
the white man's shadow.
- Man, it's "White Shadow."

21:34.875 --> 21:37.375
And y'all just jealous
'cause it's prime time.

21:37.458 --> 21:40.000
They jealous 'cause
they don't know what it is!

21:40.083 --> 21:42.166
See, y'all is nigga famous.

21:42.250 --> 21:45.208
Me and Magic here,
we're dealing with white famous.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.541
I'm talkin' about,
"old cracker granny

21:47.625 --> 21:49.208
"see your Black ass
in the grocery store,

21:49.291 --> 21:51.333
don't have to clutch her kid,"
famous.

21:51.416 --> 21:53.625
Hell, she mighta
ask for a autograph.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.041
Say, let me talk to you.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.333
Uh, yeah, yeah, one sec.

22:00.416 --> 22:02.416
- Oh. Okay. Okay!
- Okay?

22:02.500 --> 22:05.541
You know all this fame shit
ain't natural.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.416
That's the problem.

22:08.708 --> 22:10.666
We ain't born for it.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.083
And we ain't made for it.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.458
And definitely ain't ready
for that shit when it hit us.

22:15.541 --> 22:18.250
But you best believe,
everybody else is.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.250
They all hang around you
like a mojo.

22:21.333 --> 22:24.500
They been waitin'...
to pounce on your ass.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.916
What's your real name, Magic?

22:30.000 --> 22:33.541
- Earvin.
- Say "presto" to that
motherfucker.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.375
He's gone.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.375
That's the first cost
of doin' business

22:38.458 --> 22:40.083
with the white man.

22:41.208 --> 22:43.291
Magic! Magic, come on over!

22:43.375 --> 22:45.916
I wanna introduce you
to somebody!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.625
You're gonna love him.
Such a sweet kid.

22:47.708 --> 22:49.666
Run along.
Whitey needs his shadow.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.291
Magic, these are some
important friends of mine.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.291
- Gents, this is Magic Johnson.
- Hello.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.791
Let me tell you something
about this kid.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.291
Every company in the S&P

22:59.375 --> 23:01.166
is banging down his door

23:01.250 --> 23:04.958
to try to get that smile
in their ads.

23:05.041 --> 23:07.083
But, guess what?

23:07.166 --> 23:09.083
- He's all ours.

23:09.166 --> 23:11.000
Those pearly whites
are Lakers property.

23:11.083 --> 23:12.958
Now, I'm no banker.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.875
But, that seems like
a pretty substantial asset,

23:14.958 --> 23:16.500
if you ask me.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.500
What is it this week, kid?

23:18.583 --> 23:20.500
Soda pop? Chewing gum?

23:20.583 --> 23:22.250
- Shoes.
- Shoes?

23:22.333 --> 23:24.416
Footwear.
That's an evergreen sector.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.500
Yeah, yeah.
I was actually talking

23:26.583 --> 23:28.125
to this funny cat from Nike.

23:28.208 --> 23:29.958
Oh. Hope you dodged
that bullet.

23:30.041 --> 23:33.416
Huckster showed up
at the main branch,
hawking his wares.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.125
It'll be lucky to
survive the quarter.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.458
Yeah. Right.

23:36.541 --> 23:40.250
He's just another fraud
with a pipe dream.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.000
Listen, hotshot,
we've kept you long enough.

23:44.083 --> 23:47.083
The ladies are gettin' restless.
We'll let you go.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.541
Hi.

23:48.625 --> 23:51.041
- Hello, sweetheart, how are you?
- You gonna introduce me?

23:51.125 --> 23:53.458
- Well, actually,
I was about to--
- Cindy Day.

23:53.541 --> 23:55.750
- Cindy Day.<i> Enchanté.</i>
- Frank.

23:55.833 --> 23:58.666
- <i> Enchanté.</i>
- You guys know each other?

23:58.750 --> 24:00.541
Yeah, she's my date
for the night.

24:00.625 --> 24:02.708
- Fantastic.
- I'm his date for the night.
Okay.

24:02.791 --> 24:06.458
- Yeah.
- Did you tell them
I wash your little drawers?

24:06.541 --> 24:08.291
- Cindy.
- I also wash his plate.
It's okay.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.375
- Cindy, I just met them--
- It's okay.
Do y'all have children?

24:11.458 --> 24:13.750
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes. We, uh,

24:13.833 --> 24:16.791
we should start signing
autographs, right?

24:16.875 --> 24:18.958
That's actually
a great idea, Cindy.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.500
You guys want
a couple autographs?

24:20.583 --> 24:21.916
- That'd be great.
- Sure.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.041
- Okay.
- You don't mind, do you?

24:23.125 --> 24:25.166
- Of course not.
- Alright, cool.

24:25.250 --> 24:28.375
- I'll get some menus over here.
- Yeah...

24:28.458 --> 24:31.500
- Do anybody got a pen?
- I got a pen.

24:31.583 --> 24:32.833
- She has a pen.
- Look at that.

24:32.916 --> 24:35.541
- Y'all got some paper?

24:35.625 --> 24:38.000
You're about the prettiest
publicist I've ever met.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.666
- Somethin' else.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.291
- We? We--

24:43.375 --> 24:45.500
We signing autographs now?
Fuck you famous for?
'Cause I musta forgot.

24:45.583 --> 24:48.041
Calm-- calm down, okay, I was--
I was only trying to help.

24:48.125 --> 24:50.166
Ain't ask for your help!

24:50.250 --> 24:51.333
I ain't need it!

24:51.416 --> 24:52.541
You and your pops both.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.416
- Coming all this way to visit.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.166
- Just trying to lock me down.
- To what?

24:57.250 --> 24:58.333
You heard him.

24:58.416 --> 25:00.583
One minute, we talkin' business.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.166
The next, he on about
you and me, talking about...

25:03.250 --> 25:05.250
"Be smarter and keep
everybody happy."

25:05.333 --> 25:07.833
I didn't put him up to that.
I sw-- I swear!

25:07.916 --> 25:11.541
The trouble ain't me!
It's all y'all wanting a piece!

25:11.625 --> 25:13.916
- I don't want anything.
- Like hell you don't!

25:14.000 --> 25:16.500
You won't Magic just
like everybody else.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.291
Sell they shit.
Impress your daddy.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.666
- At least be real
about this shit!
- I want you.

25:23.166 --> 25:24.458
Earvin.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.875
Earvin, I...

25:27.958 --> 25:29.666
Earvin, I love you. Earvin--

25:29.750 --> 25:31.916
How the fuck you love me
when you don't even know me?!

25:33.750 --> 25:37.791
If I was picking up
trash in Lansing,
you think you'd still be here?

25:37.875 --> 25:40.666
Washing my dishes,
cleaning my drawers?

25:40.750 --> 25:43.916
All while I'm in the other room,
talking to Cookie?

25:48.250 --> 25:49.875
Uh-huh. Hm.

25:50.958 --> 25:53.750
How's she doin'?

25:53.833 --> 25:55.333
That's the man you lov--

25:56.666 --> 25:58.583
That's the man you love.

26:02.708 --> 26:04.125
Leave me the fuck alone!

26:12.125 --> 26:14.666
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:14.750 --> 26:17.208
Yeah, that's the man I love.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.041
- Cindy...
- Mm-hm?

26:26.125 --> 26:27.583
Why?

26:37.583 --> 26:39.041
Because I see what you don't.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.958
Hey. Look at me.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.541
I see you.

27:40.125 --> 27:44.333
- I love you.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.375
Magic!

28:33.333 --> 28:35.666
<i>You want to win friends</i>
<i>and influence people?</i>

28:35.750 --> 28:37.375
Read the book.

28:37.458 --> 28:40.208
<i>You want to sell</i>
<i>the Great Western Bank</i>
<i>on basketball?</i>

28:40.291 --> 28:42.125
<i>Just get 'em laid.</i>

28:42.208 --> 28:43.375
Hey!

28:43.458 --> 28:45.958
- Look what I got here!
- Alright.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.416
Okay, so this is what
I can offer you, Mister--

28:50.500 --> 28:52.375
Ah! Ah! Ah! Doctor.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.208
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

28:54.291 --> 28:56.500
Dr. Buss.

28:57.416 --> 28:59.000
Six-month extension.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.291
What'd I tell you?

29:04.125 --> 29:05.625
At 30%.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.500
That's a million bucks in vig.

29:09.583 --> 29:12.625
Mm, yeah, which is why
if you're the businessman

29:12.708 --> 29:16.166
that you say you are,
then you'll turn us down,

29:16.250 --> 29:19.791
and we'll see you in
bankruptcy.

29:21.791 --> 29:23.583
I'll tell you what.

29:23.666 --> 29:27.583
You make it June,
and we got a deal.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.833
Can I ask why?

29:29.916 --> 29:31.208
Because in May,

29:31.291 --> 29:33.000
we're gonna win
the Championship.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.291
Mm...

29:34.375 --> 29:36.750
And then, I'm gonna need
a couple weeks' vacation

29:36.833 --> 29:39.416
before I take a flight
to Sacramento,

29:39.500 --> 29:41.291
walk into your office,

29:41.375 --> 29:44.375
and make you beg
to keep our business.

29:49.541 --> 29:50.666
Well...

29:54.416 --> 29:56.250
I hope you keep winning.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.583
Count on it.

30:03.041 --> 30:05.166
- Come on.
- Thank you, Wes.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.625
You see? Not a problem.

30:16.083 --> 30:18.875
What the fuck
is this clown doing?

30:18.958 --> 30:20.916
Oh, you got to be--
Come on, you got me!

30:21.000 --> 30:22.916
The buzzards catch you out here
with that sad sack look

30:23.000 --> 30:25.125
on your fuckin' face,
you'll be in tomorrow's paper.

30:25.208 --> 30:26.958
- It was kind of a tough night.
- Yeah, well,

30:27.041 --> 30:29.583
I hate to break it to you, but
there's a shit storm blowing in.

30:29.666 --> 30:31.125
Bill's asked me
to walk you through it.

30:31.208 --> 30:33.125
Fuckin' hurry up!
You're not a duck! Come on.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.375
- Put this on.
That's Missoni.
- Alright.

30:35.458 --> 30:38.083
Fuck, don't stretch it.
It's cashmere. Come on--

30:38.166 --> 30:40.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jerry, the hounds are waiting.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.083
It's a stakeout.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.750
You always meet the buzzards
on your own terms.

30:45.833 --> 30:49.375
Here we go.
The important thing is
to project a sense of calm.

30:49.458 --> 30:50.875
You're not just
talking to the media.

30:50.958 --> 30:53.000
You're talking to the team,
plus every other motherfucking

30:53.083 --> 30:54.166
up-and-comer
in the league.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.000
They're smelling blood,
and we're the meat.

30:56.083 --> 30:57.458
Well, they don't know
Jack McKinney.

30:57.541 --> 31:00.125
He's gonna be up and yelling
at that radio by halftime.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.291
You got your fucking
degree from where, Doc?

31:02.375 --> 31:04.166
- Huh? Oh, hang on.
- Huh?

31:04.250 --> 31:06.041
"Assistant coach
promises quick return."

31:06.125 --> 31:07.250
Boom! There's your headline!

31:07.333 --> 31:09.041
And then tomorrow, when
he's not there, what then?

31:09.125 --> 31:10.458
Boom! Panic! Chaos!

31:10.541 --> 31:12.625
Then buzzards are fucking you
in your fat little ass!

31:12.708 --> 31:15.125
- I don't wanna be
buzzard-fucked.
- No!

31:15.208 --> 31:16.291
Don't oversell.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.791
- But what am I supposed to say?
- As little as possible.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.375
Jack is in the best
of hands, okay?

31:20.458 --> 31:22.333
Jack is on the mend,
and in the meantime,

31:22.416 --> 31:23.791
I'm holding down the fort,

31:23.875 --> 31:26.166
confident that the team
is behind the both of us,

31:26.250 --> 31:29.250
110%. Yeah, just like that.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.875
- Okay.
- You want to do it?

31:30.958 --> 31:33.541
Fuck no!
You out of your fucking...

31:33.625 --> 31:35.791
No, just look, you know...

31:35.875 --> 31:37.500
Take it easy, okay?

31:37.583 --> 31:40.291
Alright? You're a natural.

31:40.375 --> 31:43.000
And if the press happen
to hang you up on anything,
just, well,

31:43.083 --> 31:45.125
go to your comfort zone.

31:45.208 --> 31:46.916
What's that?

31:52.666 --> 31:54.125
Jack McKinney is on the mend.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.500
I'm holding down the fort,

31:57.583 --> 32:00.375
and I know that
the franchise is behind us all.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.583
- Both of us...

32:02.666 --> 32:04.541
Franchise is behind
us both 100%.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.250
So, there's nothing
to the reports that
he's in a coma?

32:06.333 --> 32:08.333
- How about these rumors that
Jack's fighting for his life?
- Rumors?

32:08.416 --> 32:10.208
You know what? I'm not gonna
get caught up in rumors.

32:10.291 --> 32:13.541
We're going to focus
on the task ahead.

32:13.625 --> 32:16.375
And for me right now,
the task ahead

32:16.458 --> 32:17.750
well, it's Denver.

32:17.833 --> 32:20.208
And, uh, Skywalker Thompson.

32:20.291 --> 32:23.083
- He went on a tear
last night in Utah.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.500
Yeah, he sure did.

32:24.583 --> 32:26.500
I think that's probably why, uh,

32:26.583 --> 32:29.500
that's probably why
Jack McKinney is playing hooky

32:29.583 --> 32:31.666
because, uh, he wants
to avoid a repeat.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.416
So, you and Jack talked
about the Utah game?

32:33.500 --> 32:35.791
- Does that mean he's conscious?
- That's after the accident?

32:38.208 --> 32:39.625
- What are you not telling us?
- I'm not saying--

32:39.708 --> 32:41.541
Jack McKinney is on the mend.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.041
- What'd you tell him to say?
- I didn't tell him to say shit.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.416
- Is he in critical condition?
- Paul, you gotta
give us something.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.708
Is he in a vegetable
state or what?

32:48.791 --> 32:50.291
I...

32:50.375 --> 32:53.250
- What do we tell the fans?
- Just tell them...

32:58.958 --> 33:01.458
"If it be now,

33:01.541 --> 33:03.375
"'tis not to come.

33:05.166 --> 33:07.500
"If it be not to come

33:07.583 --> 33:09.041
"it will be now.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.500
"If it not be now,

33:13.583 --> 33:16.375
yet it will come."

33:17.250 --> 33:19.583
- Come on, Paul.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.833
"The readiness...

33:22.416 --> 33:24.375
is all."

33:24.458 --> 33:26.416
- Get up there.
Get him off the stage now.
- Thank you.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.791
Okay! Okay!

33:27.875 --> 33:30.291
We'll see you all at
the game tonight, huh?

33:30.375 --> 33:32.250
What the fuck was that?

33:32.333 --> 33:34.916
- My comfort zone.
- Will he be able to coach again?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.375
- That's it, folks, thank you.
- Wow...

33:37.458 --> 33:39.291
<i>Wise words from</i>
<i>Jack McKinney's substitute.</i>

33:39.375 --> 33:41.833
<i>This time last year,</i>
<i>he was teaching Shakespeare.</i>

33:41.916 --> 33:45.666
<i>- Tonight, he steps in as--</i>
- Oh, that oughta keep
'em chasing their tails.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.416
Yeah, well, I wish they
were the only ones.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.291
I spent all night

33:49.375 --> 33:51.250
trying to decipher

33:51.333 --> 33:53.708
what the hunting pattern
of the Bengal tiger

33:53.791 --> 33:57.916
has to do with keeping
Thompson out of the lane.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.958
- Well, you stick one there,
he'll probably avoid it.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.208
Thanks.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.083
This is Jack shit.
Alright? It's not for you.

34:04.166 --> 34:05.625
- Come on! Goddammit.
- Let it go.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.166
Let it go. What would you do?

34:09.333 --> 34:11.291
- What I would do...
- Your show.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.958
If it was me, I would--
I would do something
off the wall.

34:17.041 --> 34:20.291
- I would-- I would start Cooper.
- Great.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.750
No, you know what?
I would play it safe,

34:21.833 --> 34:23.583
and I would stick with Haywood.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.958
Alright.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.375
No, Cooper.

34:31.166 --> 34:32.791
Or Haywood?

34:33.833 --> 34:35.750
That's a good idea.

34:38.166 --> 34:40.458
Fuck!

34:40.541 --> 34:41.916
You want the job?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.083
<i>You know what you</i>
<i>could do with Thompson?</i>

34:51.166 --> 34:54.166
<i>Drive him baseline to his</i>
<i>weak hand for the trap.</i>

34:54.250 --> 34:56.125
Haywood and Cooper double-team.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.000
<i>He's weaker when</i>
<i>he moves to the left,</i>

34:58.083 --> 34:59.500
<i>so you force him that way.</i>

34:59.583 --> 35:01.500
<i>Overplay the passing lanes.</i>

35:03.375 --> 35:06.541
You know what...
You know what you
could do with Thompson?

35:11.541 --> 35:13.000
The team is here.

35:13.083 --> 35:14.250
Okay.

35:14.333 --> 35:15.375
Oh...

35:15.458 --> 35:17.583
- I'm going to take Cran home.
- Yeah.

35:17.666 --> 35:19.958
Yeah, she--
She definitely needs a break.

35:20.041 --> 35:21.958
- You do, too.
- Yeah.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.583
Nothing good can come
from sitting here,

35:28.666 --> 35:31.208
watching him like this.

35:31.291 --> 35:35.208
"I make as much use of it
as many a man doth...

35:36.041 --> 35:37.958
a<i> memento mori."</i>

35:38.958 --> 35:40.375
It's a Death's Head.

35:40.458 --> 35:42.875
Elizabethans used to
put it everywhere

35:42.958 --> 35:46.916
with that inscription.
<i>Memento mori.</i>
"Remember...

35:47.958 --> 35:50.250
you will die."

35:50.333 --> 35:51.833
Shakespeare sealed
the words in wax

35:51.916 --> 35:54.625
on everything he wrote
after his son died.

35:54.708 --> 35:57.458
No, there's something
beautiful in that.

35:57.541 --> 36:00.291
Life is fleeting,
so make every moment count.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.458
It meant the opposite.

36:03.541 --> 36:05.958
Life is meaningless.

36:06.041 --> 36:08.083
All earthly things are vanity.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.416
<i>Well, that's less cheerful.</i>

36:11.666 --> 36:13.333
<i>I, uh...</i>

36:16.791 --> 36:19.083
I can't believe I have
to coach this game.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.833
You can do it.

36:26.666 --> 36:29.083
You shakin' like a flea-bit dog.

36:29.166 --> 36:30.750
It's all over.

36:30.833 --> 36:33.250
Man, you don't know that.
Coach could pull through.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.416
No, not-not Coach.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.875
It's just...

36:36.958 --> 36:39.875
Me, man.
Westhead ain't no fan.

36:39.958 --> 36:41.375
What makes you say that?

36:41.458 --> 36:43.958
I seen it in camp.
The way he was looking at me,

36:44.041 --> 36:45.791
like I was a loose thread
on a sweater.

36:45.875 --> 36:48.375
I bet you he can't
wait to cut me off.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.750
Is that right?

36:50.333 --> 36:52.125
Hm. Brother,

36:52.208 --> 36:55.250
I ain't known you but a minute,
but what I can say

36:55.333 --> 36:56.583
is you are the nervousest cat

36:56.666 --> 36:59.333
in a building full
of people dying.

36:59.416 --> 37:02.583
Didn't nobody end up
in the NBA by accident.

37:02.666 --> 37:04.708
I don't know, Spence.
Maybe I'm the first.

37:04.791 --> 37:09.083
No, you're not.
You supposed to be here.
You understand?

37:09.166 --> 37:11.000
McKinney or no McKinney.

37:11.083 --> 37:12.791
Coach is just a coach.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.791
All the damn talent you got?

37:14.875 --> 37:17.625
Any fool could see it!
Even Westhead!

37:25.833 --> 37:28.416
Hey. Uh...

37:28.500 --> 37:31.583
Wanna thank you all
for coming. Um...

37:31.666 --> 37:33.791
I know that it's going
to mean a lot to Jack.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.333
How is he?

37:37.666 --> 37:39.333
He's better. He's better.
Thank you.

37:39.416 --> 37:42.666
Um, he's probably
not well enough for visitors

37:42.750 --> 37:45.041
just yet.
So, let's keep him
in our thoughts

37:45.125 --> 37:47.416
and, uh, I'll see you
at the game.

37:54.208 --> 37:55.458
Oh...

37:55.541 --> 37:59.958
I-I'm sorry. I hope I'm not,
uh, interrupting.

38:00.041 --> 38:01.666
These are from Magic.

38:01.750 --> 38:04.291
He is so sorry
that he couldn't be here,

38:04.375 --> 38:06.083
but he just wanted to make sure

38:06.166 --> 38:08.291
that Coach McKinney knows

38:08.375 --> 38:10.500
how much he means to us.

38:10.583 --> 38:13.708
So, you know, there's some
eucalyptus in there, so...

38:13.791 --> 38:16.000
that's good
for his breathing.

38:27.791 --> 38:30.833
I think you're making
a wise choice.

38:30.916 --> 38:34.333
So what I'm supposed to say
to the ones I ain't going with?

38:34.416 --> 38:35.791
Nothing.

38:35.875 --> 38:37.833
You can't muddy up that
million-dollar smile

38:37.916 --> 38:39.916
- delivering bad news.
- Alright.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.708
- Right on!
- That can be my job.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.666
Gentlemen! Welcome.

38:51.750 --> 38:54.166
Come on in! Son,

38:54.250 --> 38:55.541
on behalf of Converse,

38:55.625 --> 38:58.583
we are just thrilled to
welcome you into our stable.

38:59.875 --> 39:02.375
I think we are gonna
make a lot of hay.

39:02.458 --> 39:03.958
Before we put pen to paper,

39:04.041 --> 39:06.125
I took the liberty
of making some adjustments.

39:06.208 --> 39:09.458
For starters, we've learned
that Larry Bird has agreed

39:09.541 --> 39:11.916
to $90,000, and we believe

39:12.000 --> 39:13.666
we should command 100.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.875
- Well, that's quite an ask.
- Well...

39:18.958 --> 39:21.208
my man is quite an athlete.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.125
Well, you drive
a hard bargain,

39:23.208 --> 39:24.916
but you got
yourself a deal.

39:27.458 --> 39:28.750
That's what I'm talkin' about!

39:28.833 --> 39:31.125
- Yeah.
- Some notes.

39:31.208 --> 39:34.333
So, I was thinking...

39:34.416 --> 39:37.041
We put my name
right there on the shoe.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.458
I'm thinking...

39:39.541 --> 39:41.125
"The Magic."

39:43.666 --> 39:46.708
I see it. Look, "The Magic."

39:46.791 --> 39:48.875
Ain't no one else done that!

39:48.958 --> 39:50.250
Well, that's an idea!

39:50.333 --> 39:52.750
We'll run it up the flagpole
back at corporate.

39:52.833 --> 39:56.458
But first, let's get you
on the dotted line.

39:56.541 --> 39:58.000
To Magic.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.375
You won't regret it.

40:09.583 --> 40:10.708
He regrets it.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.583
<i>My father Lydus was a genius.</i>

40:25.250 --> 40:28.000
<i>He had a head for numbers.</i>

40:28.083 --> 40:29.875
I think he liked numbers
more than he liked people,

40:29.958 --> 40:31.583
far as I can tell.

40:31.666 --> 40:34.250
Definitely liked numbers
more than he liked me.

40:36.833 --> 40:39.208
Left us high and dry
when I was born.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.750
Mom was 19.

40:42.833 --> 40:45.541
No high school education.

40:45.625 --> 40:47.833
Now, she's got
this kid to raise.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.708
Middle of the fucking Dust Bowl.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.250
<i>But, she got us here.</i>

40:59.000 --> 41:00.666
<i>She got us here.</i>

41:00.750 --> 41:04.166
- That's one tough broad.
- Dr. Buss?

41:04.833 --> 41:05.916
Hey.

41:07.458 --> 41:08.666
How's she doin'?

41:08.750 --> 41:10.791
Exhausted, but coherent.

41:10.875 --> 41:13.041
There's no outward
sign of trauma.

41:13.125 --> 41:16.041
Oh, good. Good.
Yeah. Right?

41:16.125 --> 41:17.875
Yeah...

41:17.958 --> 41:20.916
I figured she just
forgot to eat.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.833
- Could be.

41:23.916 --> 41:26.416
Why don't you bring her by
for a full workup?

41:26.500 --> 41:28.625
In the meantime,

41:28.708 --> 41:30.833
take care of yourself, too.

41:30.916 --> 41:32.208
You look tired.

41:32.291 --> 41:34.375
See if you can keep it
to a pack a day.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.208
Sure thing, Doc.

41:40.333 --> 41:41.958
<i>See?</i>

41:42.041 --> 41:43.583
She's gonna be fine.

41:43.666 --> 41:46.083
<i>I always wanted to</i>
<i>go out with a bang.</i>

41:48.000 --> 41:50.791
Instead, I seem to be rotting.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.541
No. Bullshit.

41:53.625 --> 41:55.666
Alcohol is a preservative.

41:58.458 --> 42:01.416
Well, at least
I taught you to laugh.

42:01.500 --> 42:03.916
I know I fucked up
everything else.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.500
Come on.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.000
Don't talk like that.

42:10.583 --> 42:12.708
You got me where I am today.

42:13.625 --> 42:15.208
Hm...

42:23.041 --> 42:24.791
Sorry, I'll wait outside.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.375
It's my fault.

42:46.750 --> 42:48.333
Just a spell.

42:49.833 --> 42:52.291
No, it wasn't the first time.

42:53.541 --> 42:56.083
Opening night, she didn't
know what day it was.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.458
She was out of it.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.416
I should've told you,
but I didn't want to ruin
your big day.

43:09.833 --> 43:11.458
Jeanie.

43:12.916 --> 43:14.291
Get it together.

43:14.375 --> 43:16.208
- She's gonna be okay.

44:16.333 --> 44:17.666
What's goin' on, Coach?

44:19.333 --> 44:20.875
Game day. Hey.

44:20.958 --> 44:22.666
Okay.

44:23.583 --> 44:25.083
Gentlemen...

44:29.750 --> 44:33.208
I know that it's hard right now.

44:33.291 --> 44:35.500
I know that
our hearts are heavy.

44:37.791 --> 44:40.291
But, we got a job to do.

44:40.375 --> 44:42.583
And there is nothing--
There is nothing!

44:42.666 --> 44:46.541
That Jack McKinney
would want more than a win.

44:46.625 --> 44:48.375
- That's right.
- Yep!

44:49.500 --> 44:52.000
So, let's take a minute.
Let's take a minute.

44:54.416 --> 44:56.708
"Give sorrow words.

44:56.791 --> 44:58.541
"The grief that does not speak,

44:58.625 --> 45:02.166
whispers the o'erfraught heart
and bids it break."

45:03.958 --> 45:05.500
Hm?

45:06.458 --> 45:08.250
So, Coach dead?

45:08.333 --> 45:09.666
No. No, no, no.

45:09.750 --> 45:12.750
- No. No, no. Not at all.

45:12.833 --> 45:15.291
Yeah.
Who's guarding Thompson?

45:15.375 --> 45:17.875
- I got him, Coach.
- Hell no. You the slowest
in conditioning.

45:17.958 --> 45:19.916
- Who you talking about?
- Bunny is your man.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.166
- You crazy.
- Cooper.

45:22.833 --> 45:24.791
You're starting at four.

45:24.875 --> 45:28.083
- Jim, you're next
in the rotation.
- What?

45:28.166 --> 45:30.625
Where that put me, Coach?

45:30.708 --> 45:32.458
It puts you on the bench.

45:32.541 --> 45:34.041
- Whoa.
- Brutal.

45:34.125 --> 45:35.333
Everybody else,

45:35.416 --> 45:36.875
same as usual. Okay?

45:36.958 --> 45:39.750
- Alright, come on,
bring it in. Bring it in!

45:39.833 --> 45:42.166
Jack on three! One, two, three.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.625
Jack!

45:43.708 --> 45:45.583
- Hey. Hey, Paul?

45:45.666 --> 45:47.500
I can take Thompson. Whoo!

45:47.583 --> 45:49.125
Is there a problem?

45:49.208 --> 45:51.750
Well, I'm not sure if you heard
what I said back at the hospital

45:51.833 --> 45:53.333
between me and the young blood,

45:53.416 --> 45:56.041
but if it's putting us
off on the wrong foot...

45:56.125 --> 45:57.875
Oh...

45:57.958 --> 46:00.750
No, no. This is a--
This is a basketball decision.

46:01.541 --> 46:02.916
It's nothing personal.

46:04.833 --> 46:06.250
Okay?

46:08.458 --> 46:10.333
Hey, uh, Young Buck?

46:10.416 --> 46:13.083
You gonna play this one,
or you gonna let your girl
do it for you?

46:14.708 --> 46:16.208
Girl?

46:16.291 --> 46:18.125
You gonna send your squeeze
to the hospital

46:18.208 --> 46:19.208
and think we ain't gonna say?

46:19.291 --> 46:20.791
Fine ol' redbone, too.

46:20.875 --> 46:22.416
You lucky I ain't holler at her.

46:22.500 --> 46:25.583
- Well,
she sat next to me, so...
- Cindy?

46:25.666 --> 46:27.208
I ain't even know
she went to the hospital.

46:27.291 --> 46:29.750
With 10 funerals of flowers.

46:29.833 --> 46:31.416
Rip Van Winkle ever wake up,

46:31.500 --> 46:33.208
- he gonna think
he in a garden.

46:33.291 --> 46:34.833
Nice touch, Young Blood.

46:34.916 --> 46:37.291
Not as nice as showing up
yourself though.

46:37.375 --> 46:39.250
Say it again, Cap.

46:45.416 --> 46:47.791
I'd like to be friends with her!

46:47.875 --> 46:49.291
Hey, babe.

46:51.125 --> 46:52.250
Hey.

46:52.333 --> 46:54.041
What's... What's wrong?

46:54.125 --> 46:56.000
Y'all brought too many flowers.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.666
- I ain't asked you to do that.
- Well, I was--

46:57.750 --> 46:59.666
You got me up in there
looking crazy

46:59.750 --> 47:00.958
in front of all my teammates.

47:01.041 --> 47:02.375
I was just trying
to be gracious.

47:02.458 --> 47:05.083
- I was representing you--
- There he is!

47:05.166 --> 47:06.750
The Converse Man.

47:06.833 --> 47:09.208
The lovely young Miss Buss
has been giving me the tour.

47:10.250 --> 47:12.166
Nice shoes.
Congratulations.

47:12.250 --> 47:14.583
Thanks. I got some good advice.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.541
Nonsense. He's a natural.
Between the three of you,

47:16.625 --> 47:18.958
our future is in good hands.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.750
Why don't I, uh,
show you to your seats?

47:23.833 --> 47:24.916
Thank you.

47:26.166 --> 47:27.541
Hey, Doc.
You got a minute?

47:27.625 --> 47:29.458
Something the matter, son?

47:30.250 --> 47:31.458
Nah...

47:31.541 --> 47:34.541
Look... Yeah.

47:35.208 --> 47:36.708
Look,

47:36.791 --> 47:38.750
I appreciate you,

47:38.833 --> 47:40.833
and everything
you done did for me.

47:40.916 --> 47:43.708
And Cindy is a great girl,

47:43.791 --> 47:45.458
really, really sweet.

47:45.541 --> 47:46.666
But,

47:46.750 --> 47:49.125
if you think we be more
than what we be...

47:49.208 --> 47:51.458
And what would that be?

47:51.541 --> 47:53.500
You helping me
with business and all.

47:53.583 --> 47:56.041
That make you an agent?

47:56.125 --> 47:57.791
I prefer to be a friend.

47:57.875 --> 48:00.291
How much cut a friend get?

48:00.375 --> 48:03.375
The only thing I want that
you can give me is your trust.

48:03.458 --> 48:06.291
We can let the money
come in time,

48:06.375 --> 48:08.458
once you've made plenty more.

48:11.541 --> 48:13.125
And Cindy?

48:14.958 --> 48:17.000
I ain't ready
to settle down yet.

48:20.291 --> 48:23.041
Son, I love my daughter
more than anyone.

48:23.125 --> 48:26.000
I want her to be happy.
But, me and you?

48:26.083 --> 48:28.583
Well, that's another
thing now, isn't it?

48:29.500 --> 48:31.583
- Business.
- That it is.

48:31.666 --> 48:33.583
And I don't see why
the end of one relationship

48:33.666 --> 48:35.500
should sacrifice the other.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.458
Right on.

48:40.541 --> 48:42.333
Think you could tell her for me?

48:43.375 --> 48:45.708
Hey, like you said.

48:45.791 --> 48:49.333
Magic ain't supposed to be
the one to give 'em bad news.

48:56.083 --> 48:58.083
I'll let her down light.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.041
Yeah, those is the Lakers,
not the Fakers.

49:06.125 --> 49:07.666
Hey, Black man, Black man,

49:07.750 --> 49:09.916
- Black man.
- Spencer, my main man.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.333
- Oh man.
- I know you've been living
like a saint these days,

49:12.416 --> 49:14.500
but if you wanna
celebrate after the game,

49:14.583 --> 49:16.291
party's at my place
in the hills.

49:16.375 --> 49:17.708
Come on up, man.
We got it all.

49:17.791 --> 49:20.791
Man, we got white bitches,
7-Up, and cocaine.

49:23.958 --> 49:26.000
- Know what I mean?
Know what I mean, Jack?
- Maybe so.

49:26.083 --> 49:32.041
<i>Introducing your</i>
<i>Los Angeles Lakers!</i>

49:51.000 --> 49:52.291
- Hey, Bill.
- Jerry.

49:56.541 --> 49:58.750
Some fuckin' day, huh?

50:00.083 --> 50:01.583
Yes, sir.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.708
<i>Chick Hearn</i>
<i>along with Pat Riley</i>

50:03.791 --> 50:06.166
<i>here for another game</i>
<i>of Lakers basketball.</i>

50:06.250 --> 50:09.833
<i>Tonight, the team</i>
<i>will not be joined by</i>
<i>head coach Jack McKinney.</i>

50:09.916 --> 50:12.000
<i>Our prayers are with him.</i>
<i>But, let's hope the Lakers</i>

50:12.083 --> 50:13.416
<i>won't be needing</i>
<i>any of their own.</i>

50:13.500 --> 50:15.625
<i>The man filling in for him</i>
<i>on the sidelines</i>

50:15.708 --> 50:17.875
<i>will be his assistant.</i>
<i>First name Paul,</i>

50:17.958 --> 50:19.708
<i>last name Westhead.</i>

50:19.791 --> 50:22.250
<i>A few months ago, this guy</i>
<i>was teaching Shakespeare</i>

50:22.333 --> 50:24.208
<i>at La Salle College</i>
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

50:24.291 --> 50:27.708
<i>Now here he is, coaching</i>
<i>one of the NBA's marquee teams</i>

50:27.791 --> 50:31.041
<i>and trying to</i>
<i>hold down the fort for</i>
<i>his friend and mentor,</i>

50:31.125 --> 50:32.875
<i>who, we are told,</i>
<i>is on the mend.</i>

50:32.958 --> 50:35.500
<i>- Well, this one's</i>
<i>for you, Jack.</i>

50:35.583 --> 50:38.041
<i>Okay, now both teams</i>
<i>in the center circle.</i>

50:38.125 --> 50:41.750
<i>Here's the tip</i>
<i>controlled by Kareem</i>
<i>and this contest is underway.</i>

50:41.833 --> 50:43.916
<i>Magic brings the ball</i>
<i>down the floor.</i>

51:00.250 --> 51:01.583
Jack?

51:03.875 --> 51:06.458
Hey. Jack?

51:12.583 --> 51:14.375
No, Jack.

51:14.458 --> 51:16.083
Help! Jack!

51:17.875 --> 51:19.458
Wake up.

51:19.541 --> 51:20.583
Jack!

51:20.666 --> 51:23.375
Somebody come help us!
Please! Nurse!

51:23.458 --> 51:26.166
Jack! Help us! Jack!

51:26.250 --> 51:29.000
You know what you
could do with Thompson?

51:29.083 --> 51:32.000
Drive him baseline to
his weak hand for the trap.

51:32.083 --> 51:34.208
Haywood and Cooper double-team.

51:34.291 --> 51:36.000
He's weaker when
he goes to the left,

51:36.083 --> 51:37.500
so you force him that way.

51:37.583 --> 51:39.541
You overplay the passing lanes,

51:39.625 --> 51:41.000
beat 'em on the turnovers.

51:41.083 --> 51:43.791
Of course, he won't pass
if Issel's camped out

51:43.875 --> 51:46.833
under the bucket
for the put-back,
so you go big!

51:46.916 --> 51:48.458
You put a big man on his ass!

51:48.541 --> 51:50.083
That's why we got Haywood!

51:50.166 --> 51:52.333
So... box out Issel.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.458
Thompson can't beat us himself.

51:56.541 --> 51:58.833
- Like that, see?
- What difference
would that make?

51:58.916 --> 52:00.500
You see?

52:04.000 --> 52:06.125
I'd rather talk about Denver.

52:27.041 --> 52:30.541
- Paul, Paul!
He's asking for you.
- Okay, okay, okay!

52:30.625 --> 52:31.625
Jack!

52:31.708 --> 52:33.750
Hey. Hi.

52:33.833 --> 52:35.833
Go big...

52:35.916 --> 52:37.625
Sorry, what, Jack?

52:37.708 --> 52:39.458
Go big...

52:39.541 --> 52:42.416
Go big against...

52:43.333 --> 52:46.375
against Thompson.

52:46.458 --> 52:48.166
Denver, go big.

52:52.875 --> 52:55.083
We, we already
played them, Jack.

52:57.250 --> 52:59.375
Denver was two weeks ago.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.083
Fuck my dick.

53:07.166 --> 53:09.000
Fuck... I came back.

53:09.083 --> 53:10.916
- I know, I know...
- I came back.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.208
I know... I know...

53:15.791 --> 53:17.666
Do you guys wanna sign up?

53:17.750 --> 53:19.583
I think so, when they
migrated to Detroit.

53:19.666 --> 53:21.875
- Ms. Kelly!

53:23.458 --> 53:24.666
Dr. Day?

53:35.125 --> 53:36.666
- What's this?
- Tickets.

53:36.750 --> 53:38.208
The Lakers are
coming to Detroit,

53:38.291 --> 53:40.750
and Earvin would
love to have you.

53:42.333 --> 53:43.958
He would, would he?

53:46.000 --> 53:48.208
Thought he would be
having your daughter.

53:48.708 --> 53:50.333
Hm.

53:50.416 --> 53:53.625
All I can say, young man
has the world at his feet.

53:53.708 --> 53:56.750
He asked me to come here
and give those to you.

53:56.833 --> 53:58.458
You make of that what you will.

54:04.125 --> 54:05.375
Girl,

54:05.458 --> 54:07.583
if you don't say yes, I will.

54:12.625 --> 54:16.666
- Tell Earvin
I'll think about it!
- Mm-hmm.

54:16.750 --> 54:19.041
You have a good day now.
