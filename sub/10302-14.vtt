01:59.920 --> 02:01.592
Hello, Naomi.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.038
Count your lucky stars, babe.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.874
Bud Bundy's in the house.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.713
Bud Bundy?

02:10.680 --> 02:13.148
We met at the frat party
last weekend.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.755
I was the one who found
your underwear.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.791
On the ceiling, right.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.072
Say, listen, seems I have
a last-minute cancellation...

02:22.320 --> 02:25.073
...in my social calendar
any night of the week...

02:25.760 --> 02:27.751
...and, well, I was wondering
if you'd like...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.230
You would? This Saturday night?

02:30.480 --> 02:33.199
Okay, Al. I'm ready.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.829
I'm gonna call you
right back with the address, okay?

02:36.080 --> 02:38.799
My masseuse is just leaving.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.274
Let's go, Al.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.072
Oh, feeling any better, Bud?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.155
Is that you, Ma?

02:58.440 --> 03:01.557
Oh, I just feel awful
that you and Kelly got sick...

03:01.800 --> 03:04.360
...and can't come with us
to my family reunion.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.989
And I really hate to leave you
in this condition.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.597
After all, I wouldn't want people
to think I'm an unfit parent.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.638
Let's see this.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.479
Ninety-eight point six.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.199
Is that good?

03:20.920 --> 03:22.148
Nope.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.312
Oh, maybe I really should stay home.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.596
I hate to miss out
on the festivities though.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.432
This year they're gonna celebrate...

03:29.640 --> 03:32.677
...the first annual
Wanker County Olympic Games.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.831
Damn this fever.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.830
You and Dad
have a tire-hugging good time.

03:41.080 --> 03:46.154
Oh, we will.
Bye, Buck. Bye, house. Bye, couch.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.834
Oh, boy.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.790
Let's go, Al.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.791
- Oh, Peg, do I have to?
- Yes.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.837
As the only
non-blood relative invited...

04:09.080 --> 04:11.435
...they're counting on you
to officiate the Olympics.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.719
Now, let's go before we miss
the ceremonial lighting of cousin Jeb.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.637
Oh, all right.
Have we got everything?

04:19.880 --> 04:22.474
- The water-purification tablets?
- Check.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.473
The meat-fish-grain
purification tablets?

04:25.720 --> 04:28.871
- Check.
- The Wanker translation book?

04:29.120 --> 04:32.396
- You know, English to gibberish.
- Check.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.438
Dad, you want me
to take the bag to the car?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.636
No, she can walk.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.074
Listen, if you don't
hear from me at least once a day...

04:43.320 --> 04:47.154
...Aunt Skeeter probably violated parole
and baked me into one of her pies.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.598
In which case, call 911...

04:49.840 --> 04:53.310
...or as they say in Wanker County,
"Nine hundred and eleven."

04:54.840 --> 04:56.831
Hey, Bud, guess what?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.959
Damn this fever.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.792
When will it end?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.315
Oh, poor thing.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.592
Hey, Peg, I think I'm coming down
with something.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.477
Yes. You're coming down with me
to Wanker County.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.917
Bags, then go.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.992
Come on.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.672
- Well, they're gone.
- For a whole week.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.239
And guess what, Kel?

05:30.480 --> 05:33.916
Saturday night I got a shot at a babe
who hasn't used the word "no"...

05:34.160 --> 05:37.709
...since the last time someone asked
her if she ever used the word "no."

05:38.880 --> 05:42.395
Well, what if I said that I needed
the house next Saturday night?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.835
What if you said you were on fire?

05:45.280 --> 05:47.555
I mean, either way
it means nothing to me.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.836
Then you'll have to tell the little
children they'll never learn to read.

05:52.080 --> 05:55.436
Kel, there's nothing
you can say to me right now that...

05:58.560 --> 06:01.028
Tell what little children
they'll never learn to read?

06:01.280 --> 06:05.398
Well, you know that anti-illiteracy
campaign that I've been so active in?

06:08.320 --> 06:11.357
- No.
- That's the one.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.828
You see, Budrick...

06:13.080 --> 06:15.594
...these kids look at me
as the Verminator...

06:15.840 --> 06:20.038
...and all they see is glamour
and bright lights and deadly poison...

06:20.280 --> 06:24.273
...but I'm more than just a sexy chick
who kills bugs. I'm a role model.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.796
So I volunteered to shoot a public
service announcement in the house...

06:28.040 --> 06:29.678
...to encourage them to read.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.833
But, Kel, you can't read.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.877
Yeah, well, you can't score,
but you still have a bed.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.834
I just thought that it was time that I
gave something back to the community.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.755
Well, judging by the lines
at the free clinic you already have.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.191
You know, that's the sort of crack...

07:00.400 --> 07:04.109
...that would make the old Kelly call
you a "rubber-loving Barbie thumper."

07:06.200 --> 07:07.838
But that's the old Kelly.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.957
The new Kelly
is simply gonna ask you...

07:10.200 --> 07:12.156
...to let me have the house
next Saturday...

07:12.360 --> 07:16.069
...so I can show these kids the beauty
of The Little Engine That Could.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.632
I loved
The Little Engine That Could.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.958
Yeah, we all did, Bud,
but some of us have moved on.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.279
"'Puff, puff, chug, chug,'
went the little blue engine."

07:28.000 --> 07:31.595
"'I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can, I think I can.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.149
I think I can."'

07:39.240 --> 07:42.915
You know, this would make a great
TV movie starring Robert Urich...

07:43.160 --> 07:45.833
...or that brawny Facts of Life girl.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.596
Wait a second, what's that smell?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.559
It's you.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.553
Bud, you smell good. What's wrong?

07:58.360 --> 07:59.759
It's my brand-new scent.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.718
Guaranteed to attract the ladies.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.598
Yeah? What's it called?

08:05.520 --> 08:07.511
"Simply Abe."

08:12.400 --> 08:17.030
And if that's not enough,
I got another buck taped to my thigh.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.275
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.035
And have fun
doing your commercial.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.032
Thank you.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.110
- Bye.
- See you.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.948
Okay. He's gone.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.515
Thanks. I was getting kind of bored
out there, so I took some pictures.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.398
See?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.713
This one here's from the house
across the street.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.678
It's nice. Thank you.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.992
Where the hell
does she find these guys?

09:05.160 --> 09:07.549
So you wanna fool around
on the couch?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.438
Relax, Gunther, we've got hours.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.108
I mean, Bud really thinks
I'm shooting a commercial.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.118
- What a Mormon.
- I know.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.150
So you wanna fool around
on the couch?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.278
Gunther, you don't just come
into my house...

09:24.520 --> 09:26.715
...covered with oil,
smoking a smelly cigar...

09:26.960 --> 09:29.190
...and ask me to fool around
on my mother's couch.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.431
I mean, that would be a sign
of low breeding.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.358
Here, we'll fool around
on the floor behind the couch.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.153
Gunther, what did you forget to do?

09:43.400 --> 09:48.315
- Oh. Sorry.
- Well, take it out.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.911
- Is that better?
- Yes.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.436
I know this may not be
quite as comfortable...

10:09.640 --> 10:11.835
...as what you're used to, my dear...

10:12.600 --> 10:16.752
...but personally,
I find making love indoors restrictive.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.709
So I'm glad that attendant
threw us out of his photomat.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.793
You're as broke
as a two-dollar wristwatch, aren't you?

10:24.040 --> 10:27.237
And hornier than a funeral
in New Orleans, baby.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.268
Shall we?

10:34.120 --> 10:37.192
- No.
- No?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.909
Where'd you pick up
that kind of language?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.952
Look, I don't know what kind of tramp
you think I am.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.390
Just because a man
can build a nest like a wren...

10:47.640 --> 10:50.279
...doesn't mean
I'll make out with him. Goodbye.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.910
But I'm wearing "Simply Abe."

11:07.400 --> 11:09.356
You know, Kelly,
I can't help but feel...

11:09.560 --> 11:13.633
...that this is, in some small way,
my fault.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.752
See you.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.352
Who's gonna tell Mom
you burnt up her couch?

11:23.760 --> 11:26.035
Wait, wait a second.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.750
I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.118
I can't believe you burned down
Mom's couch.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.797
Well, I can't believe you bought that
stupid "concern for illiteracy" crap.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.395
If you had doubted me
the way you're supposed to...

11:50.640 --> 11:52.756
...this never would have happened.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.309
Nice try, pyro-nymph.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.272
- Bud, you've got to help me.
- Oh, well, sure.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.353
If you don't mind living
a life of servitude and degradation...

12:03.560 --> 12:06.279
...I hear Saudi Arabia needs blonds.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.830
I am not asking for me.
I'm asking for Mom.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.356
I mean, this couch is her life.
She can't go on without it.

12:14.600 --> 12:19.071
Bud, if she finds out about this
it could kill her.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.872
Kelly, don't you think
you're exaggerating just a little?

12:26.600 --> 12:30.559
- Hello?
- Is my couch okay?

12:31.520 --> 12:35.035
Your couch?
Why, yes, Mom. It's fine. It's lovely.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.078
- Why do you ask?
- Well, the funniest thing...

12:38.320 --> 12:42.916
...for no reason, my rear end
suddenly got warm.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.956
Mom, what could have happened
to the couch...

12:46.200 --> 12:49.078
...that's worse than you and Dad
sitting on it, right?

12:49.560 --> 12:52.233
Yeah. I guess I'm just being silly.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.995
- Anyway, wanna say hi to your father?
- No.

12:57.400 --> 13:02.952
Last contestant in the rooster toss:
Cousin Zeke.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.268
Okay. That's 40 feet.
That's a winner.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.715
Congratulations, Zeke.

13:14.960 --> 13:20.193
We shall now have the ceremonial
running of the pigs.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.999
Not at me, you hillbillies!

13:27.960 --> 13:29.837
Well, you guys have fun...

13:30.080 --> 13:32.230
...and don't worry
about the couch, okay?

13:32.480 --> 13:36.758
- Say goodbye to Dad for me.
- AI, the kids said goodbye.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.560
Peg! To Serve Man...

13:39.800 --> 13:42.394
...it's a cookbook!

13:45.120 --> 13:49.113
- Bud, we're doomed.
- "We"? Wait a second.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.158
I didn't have anything to do with this.
I was out with a girl.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.153
And you really think
they're gonna believe that?

13:57.400 --> 13:59.356
Okay, I'll help.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.192
If we're gonna get a new couch,
we need is a picture of the old one.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.830
Great idea. Bud, you are a genius.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.992
Alrighty. Now what?

14:15.120 --> 14:18.396
Now we send this to Ripley's
along with your picture.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.955
I meant a picture before the fire.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.509
Okay, I'm gonna get
Mom's photo album.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.435
There's probably more pictures of
the couch in here than there are of us.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.308
I can't believe it.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.154
Went to every store in town
and nobody had that couch.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.709
Well, I say we get
the Guadalajara Yellow Pages...

14:43.920 --> 14:45.911
...and start calling Goodwill.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.557
Well, I will not give up.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.598
The good thing is is that we still have
another week to look.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.188
Hello?

14:54.400 --> 14:58.109
Honey, we're coming home early.
Your father's had a little accident.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.636
Accident, my ass!
They skinned me alive, Peg.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.190
Well, you know, you know better than
to stand too close to cousin Blinky...

15:06.400 --> 15:08.755
...when he's filleting ferret.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.590
Anyway, Kelly,
we're coming home tomorrow.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.671
And you know, I just can't wait to...

15:13.880 --> 15:15.472
Bud, they're coming home tomorrow.

15:15.720 --> 15:19.429
Is there anyway that I can talk you
into taking full blame for this?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.597
Sure. You can get me a woman
who won't say no.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.716
So there's no way.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.676
Hey, guys.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.632
I got the scoop on your couch.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.553
I got some friends
in the furniture business.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.030
Well, actually they're in...

15:47.240 --> 15:51.631
...the "making false compartments
in the furniture" business.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.673
- But they gave me the lowdown.
- Oh, please, let this be easy.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.911
Please, please, please.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.232
This is not going to be easy.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.278
This may come
as a surprise to you...

16:02.520 --> 16:06.229
...but your couch
wasn't exactly a popular item.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.189
How many were made?
What, a thousand? Five hundred?

16:09.440 --> 16:11.556
- What?
- Two.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.950
- Well, how many did they sell?
- One.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.353
Great. Then all we gotta do
is find the one that they sold.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.312
How hard could that be?

16:25.040 --> 16:27.076
Boy, when your looks go,
you're dead.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.472
You're dead.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.714
Now, no one really knows
where the other couch is...

16:34.960 --> 16:37.394
...but I do know who made it
and where he lives.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.835
Oh, then at least let this be easy.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.878
This is not going to be easy.

16:43.120 --> 16:46.192
It seems the guy who built it
went insane.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.668
How insane?

16:47.920 --> 16:51.037
Well, he spackled in his naval.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.750
He built a shrine to Larry
of the Three Stooges...

16:55.000 --> 16:57.673
...and he moved
deep into the woods.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.794
How deep into the woods?

17:20.680 --> 17:24.150
Hi. Are you Mary?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.914
My name is "Ma-ray." "Ma-ray."

17:27.640 --> 17:29.358
Oh, sorry.

17:29.600 --> 17:34.390
- How do you spell "Ma-ray?"
- M-A-R-Y.

17:40.680 --> 17:45.834
- Well, then how do you spell Mary?
- M-A-R-Y.

17:49.480 --> 17:54.600
So are you busy or "bus-ay"?

17:55.960 --> 17:57.393
Depends.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.995
Are you from the escort service
I called in '79?

18:00.840 --> 18:03.479
No. I'm here to see a man
about a couch.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.994
Well, come on in.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.118
But if the escort babe shows up
you're gonna have to leave.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.597
Besides, I don't know where you got
the idea that I have a couch.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.198
You want a couch, you go to a mall.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.351
You want a chair, you go to a mall.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.319
You want to see teenage girls
ride up and down escalators...

18:22.520 --> 18:25.114
...with very short skirts,
you go to a mall...

18:25.320 --> 18:30.440
...but you wanna eat fried squirrel
off a dirt floor, you come here.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.274
- Can I get you anything?
- Cappuccino?

18:33.520 --> 18:34.748
- Decaf?
- Please.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.718
Coming right up.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.638
What kind of couch you looking for?

18:42.840 --> 18:47.152
Well, one with sturdy legs, you know,
that you could fall asleep on.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.789
That's what I ordered
from the escort service.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.553
Sit down.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.358
Not there.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.715
Not there.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.276
- Then where?
- Right here.

19:00.520 --> 19:04.308
This is my bed. Sorry it's not made.
I wasn't expecting company.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.078
Thank you.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.592
- Now, let's talk couches.
- Oh, great.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.952
Here's the one that we're looking for.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.077
They say that you're the man
who made it.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.997
No. Not this one. I was desperate.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.312
My mother was sick.
We needed the money.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.595
Who are you to judge me?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.195
No, you don't understand.
We like the couch.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.557
Yeah, so do I. This is from my
"furniture for white trash" line.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.679
The "drunken hillbilly" collection.
My one attempt at commercialism.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.150
God, I hate America.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.474
Not the country. The rock group.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.468
- Say, look, Mary...
- "Ma-ray!"

19:59.800 --> 20:03.349
Mary, "Ma-ray," madman...

20:03.960 --> 20:08.431
It's getting late and I'm kind of caught
short here without a silver bullet...

20:09.240 --> 20:11.515
...so can you help me
replace the couch or not?

20:11.760 --> 20:15.355
Well, I am sorry,
but I no longer build couches.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.956
Now I just visualize world peace
and occasionally re-enact...

20:19.200 --> 20:20.713
...The Unsinkable Molly Brown.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.874
However, I am willing to part...

20:24.120 --> 20:29.353
...with what is under this giant
spreading fungus over here.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.796
It's perfect. It's perfect.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.396
- Even down to the stains.
- Made them myself.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.076
- How much?
- Don't insult me with money.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.198
Well, how can I insult you?

20:49.200 --> 20:54.911
With something I've been needing
and wanting for a very, very long time.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.557
And you're just the person
who can give it to me.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.998
I can't believe what you did
to get this couch.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.194
Well, he really wanted it, Bud.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.594
I mean, it's been years.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.557
We're home.
And I missed you so much.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.314
Oh, we missed you too, Mom.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.833
It really is okay.

21:34.080 --> 21:38.153
You know, this is the first time
my bottom has ever lied to me.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.200
- So how were the Olympics, Dad?
- Oh, fine, fine.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.353
You guys ever have a carrot peeler
run up and down your arms really fast?

21:54.280 --> 21:57.078
Of course you have.
What the heck, who hasn't?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.799
Well, I guess I'll go to bed.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.032
I haven't had
a good night's sleep since...

22:02.280 --> 22:04.077
Well, since I got married.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.754
Yeah, you know, I'm really tired too.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.117
Oh, come on Peg,
I already got skinned once today.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.112
Oh, Al, don't flatter yourself.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.749
Not everything you do turns me on.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.390
Oh, baby.
The way you open your mouth.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.318
No, Peg.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.315
Kel, looks like
you're gonna get away with it.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.711
Though they're gonna find out
what you did to get this couch.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.278
Well, God knows
I didn't wanna do it...

22:34.880 --> 22:36.313
...but in today's world...

22:36.520 --> 22:39.273
...you gotta give something
to get something.
