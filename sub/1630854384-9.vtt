00:06.906 --> 00:09.042
Andi, Brina, and Danni have

00:09.042 --> 00:11.578
decided to take turns looking
after me.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.247
I'll just call the doctor
later, myself.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.717
He found out that
I sent that email.

00:17.717 --> 00:18.985
How the hell did he do that?

00:18.985 --> 00:20.954
You do something like this
again, you will be fired.

00:20.954 --> 00:21.955
Am I clear?

let's just start there.

00:33.726 --> 00:34.893
Who did you kill?

00:34.893 --> 00:35.861
Who?

00:35.861 --> 00:37.629
Jonah.

00:37.629 --> 00:39.064
Jonah?

00:39.064 --> 00:40.499
Who is Jonah?

00:40.866 --> 00:44.803
It's that man I brought home
with me last night.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.438
Okay, just--

00:52.277 --> 00:53.679
Okay, here...here...
sorry.

00:56.281 --> 00:59.318
Okay...talk to me.

01:00.319 --> 01:01.787
Tell me what happened.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.990
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm here.

01:04.990 --> 01:06.792
-We're going to fix this.
-The man I brought

01:06.792 --> 01:09.695

01:10.863 --> 01:12.097
He hit you?

01:12.097 --> 01:14.199
Yes, in my face.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.535
He slapped me in my face.

Okay, baby, okay.
All right, it's okay, just--

I was in shock and I went crazy.

01:28.647 --> 01:30.749
Okay, go on.

01:32.184 --> 01:34.286
He spat on me and I just lost
it.

01:34.286 --> 01:36.655
Of course.
Of course.

01:36.655 --> 01:41.326
It's okay, I'm here.
We're going to get through this.

02:05.184 --> 02:09.354
Okay, go on.
So he...you said he...

02:09.354 --> 02:13.459
hit you...
and he spit in your face.

02:14.359 --> 02:17.262
He slapped me and he just kept

02:21.967 --> 02:23.602
What?

02:23.602 --> 02:26.271
And I went outside
and got a stick...

02:26.839 --> 02:28.640
and broke all his windows.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.310
And beat the shit out of him
with it.

02:32.744 --> 02:35.714
He was trying to get away so I
got in my car...

02:35.714 --> 02:39.218

just kept running him over.

02:40.919 --> 02:42.588
[sniffling]

02:43.055 --> 02:45.224
Sound like self-defense to me.

-No, no--

You're not...because in her home
is self-defense...

03:04.243 --> 03:05.377
It's okay.

03:05.944 --> 03:07.880
But once you went outside

03:07.880 --> 03:13.051
and ran him over with your car,
after he had left...

03:13.051 --> 03:15.354
it makes things a little
complicated.

-Unless...
-Fatima--

I know you're hurting about
Preston.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.522
You want to hurt him before he
hurts you cause you've been hurt

09:14.522 --> 09:16.992

09:17.792 --> 09:22.864
But you running from your

10:24.125 --> 10:25.493
Okay, that's fine.

10:26.127 --> 10:28.663
-You can call him from work.
-Okay.

10:30.498 --> 10:32.000
So poignant...

10:32.734 --> 10:36.071
profound...but can I, uh...
can I ask you something?

10:39.007 --> 10:40.709
I'm not taking questions
at this time.

10:40.709 --> 10:42.444
You see where that shit's going
don't you?

10:42.444 --> 10:44.012
Yeah, I do.
I don't like it.

10:44.479 --> 10:45.814
I don't want to go there.

10:45.814 --> 10:47.449
You set yourself up a little bit
for it though.

10:47.449 --> 10:50.418
I did.
I did set myself up, didn't I?

10:51.252 --> 10:54.055
You've been out on a limb since
you met Gary.

10:55.590 --> 10:57.759
You still out on that limb.

11:00.428 --> 11:04.999
Getting off anytime soon,
or wanna tell me about that?

11:06.201 --> 11:08.269
I know that I'm on a limb.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.939
And, um...

11:15.643 --> 11:17.879
Gary threatened to sue me.

11:19.214 --> 11:20.215
Boom.

11:21.182 --> 11:22.851
-There you are.
-It never ends.

11:22.851 --> 11:24.185
It's never ending.

11:24.552 --> 11:27.322
-The car, the house, everything.
-Wow.

11:29.057 --> 11:31.192
So I just...

11:31.192 --> 11:35.397
decided to...

11:35.397 --> 11:36.965
keep him calm.

11:37.732 --> 11:39.167
That's what I call that.

11:41.369 --> 11:43.138
You mean, -- him?

11:44.672 --> 11:46.241
That too, but...

11:46.641 --> 11:51.813
I am landing a big client,
and...

11:51.813 --> 11:54.449
they can't know that
I'm getting sued.

11:54.449 --> 11:56.751
So I decided to play nice.

11:57.952 --> 11:59.988
Andi, you decided to -- him.

12:00.422 --> 12:03.591
Yes, that too, but I did that
part because I wanted to.

12:03.591 --> 12:09.097
I mean, Gary's a lot of things,
but he's no schmo in the bed.

12:09.097 --> 12:13.868
He makes sure I'm happy,
and...that's what I wanted.

12:15.937 --> 12:18.273
So you're playing him?

12:19.607 --> 12:21.376
I'm keeping him calm.

12:23.478 --> 12:25.380
By trying to play him?

12:25.847 --> 12:28.349
Okay, Miss Attempted Murderer...

12:28.683 --> 12:31.820
is this a judgement competition
right now?

12:31.820 --> 12:35.757
Because that's what I'm--
it's very much giving that--

12:39.060 --> 12:41.229
You think he's going to go to
the police?

12:44.699 --> 12:45.934
No.

12:46.768 --> 12:48.403
If he was gonna
go to the police,

12:48.403 --> 12:50.171
he would've done so by now.

12:50.171 --> 12:52.340
He probably has a record and
doesn't want that kind

12:52.340 --> 12:53.341
of attention.

12:53.341 --> 12:54.742
[knock on door]

12:56.444 --> 12:57.545
Come in.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.182
[Fatima] Okay, I, um...
I know you told me to leave...

13:01.182 --> 13:02.484
Mm-hmm.

13:02.484 --> 13:05.753
But, um...I thought you should
take a look at this.

13:08.056 --> 13:10.892
Did you...
pull his entire record?

13:11.359 --> 13:12.594
And did.

13:12.894 --> 13:14.329
-Mm-hmm.
-And the mother-- has

13:14.329 --> 13:16.998
several assaults against women
on his record.

13:16.998 --> 13:19.100
-Danni...
-That's why he didn't...

13:19.100 --> 13:21.402
-Call the police.
-Exactly.

13:22.237 --> 13:25.006
Y'all, we need to put a stop to
this before he does it again,

13:25.006 --> 13:26.508
-I'm telling you.
-No, we're not going to.

13:26.508 --> 13:28.810
We'll...we'll outsource that.

13:28.810 --> 13:32.080
And thank you for the
information Fatima, bye.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.515
-Yeah, thanks, you're welcome.
-Yes.

13:33.781 --> 13:34.782
Mm-hmm.

13:34.782 --> 13:36.317
-Call me.
-I'll call you.

13:36.317 --> 13:37.485
No, you're not.

13:37.485 --> 13:39.153
-And will.
-[Fatima]<i> Call me.</i>

13:39.153 --> 13:40.355
I'm doing it.
It's done.

13:40.355 --> 13:41.689
It's not going to happen.

13:41.689 --> 13:42.891
I don't work for you.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.628
Well, that's true.
But you work for me, so--

13:46.628 --> 13:48.730
-[Fatima]<i> Okay, fine.
</i>-Yes, thank you.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.502
You got saved by the bell
this time.

14:00.341 --> 14:02.644
-Okay, Andi.
-No.

14:02.644 --> 14:04.779
This is a dangerous man.

14:08.182 --> 14:14.088
I cannot lose you over something
so silly as a 'hot girl summer'.

14:14.088 --> 14:14.923
Okay?

14:15.757 --> 14:18.960
Well, you know, I gotta say I
definitely planned this part.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.428
-You know, it was--
-Okay--

14:20.428 --> 14:23.131
-all a part of the plan.
-all right, get to work, Danni.

14:24.232 --> 14:26.601
We can meet with Sabrina at
5:00, can you be there?

14:26.868 --> 14:28.002
If they let me off.

14:28.636 --> 14:30.004
Or you don't get arrested?

14:30.738 --> 14:33.741
-Bye.
-I love you.

14:33.741 --> 14:36.744
And, uh, keep Fatima.

14:36.744 --> 14:38.112
She's fast.

14:38.112 --> 14:40.114
Faster than your ass, attorney.

14:40.114 --> 14:43.785
I--
well, excuse me for being legal.

14:49.316 --> 14:50.550
Hey...

14:50.550 --> 14:51.818
you need some help?

14:52.853 --> 14:54.755
Uh, no, I'm good.

14:54.755 --> 14:56.423
I re-- I really don't even mind.

14:56.423 --> 14:58.024
No, no, no, no, no...
do not...do not...

14:58.024 --> 14:59.226
stay on that side.

14:59.226 --> 15:00.994
Why are you acting so scary?

15:00.994 --> 15:02.729
She's not even here
so I can help you.

15:02.729 --> 15:05.499
No, don't touch my groceries,
Deja, what's wrong with you?

15:05.932 --> 15:08.702
-Zac.
-Dang, I said, I'm good.

15:08.702 --> 15:10.237
You stressed or something?

15:10.237 --> 15:13.440
Yes, I am, okay, I'm dealing
with a lot of bullshit, okay?

15:13.440 --> 15:16.109
Listen, ain't nobody tryin' to
bring you no bullshit.

15:16.109 --> 15:18.078
I'm just trying to be a friendly
neighbor and help you.

15:18.078 --> 15:19.012
So let me help you.

15:19.012 --> 15:20.914
Stop reaching for my bag!

15:20.914 --> 15:22.048
Look, you ain't gotta worry

15:22.048 --> 15:23.583
about me pushing up on you,
okay?

15:23.583 --> 15:25.819
I know Fatima is crazy as hell.

15:25.819 --> 15:27.053
You know that now.

15:27.053 --> 15:31.324
And you...you need to be
careful, okay?

15:31.892 --> 15:33.760
What do I need to be careful
for?

15:33.760 --> 15:35.362
Do you know who her cousin is?

15:36.696 --> 15:39.566
She's cousins with Madam.

15:39.566 --> 15:42.169
This bitch is "nitorious".

15:42.502 --> 15:44.971
She be knocking -- off.
Ask where her ex-man is?

15:44.971 --> 15:46.239
"Nitorious?"

15:46.239 --> 15:47.474
[Deja] Ask me where
her ex-man is?

15:47.474 --> 15:48.708
-Where's her ex-man?
-Dead, in a ditch.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.110
Nobody's seen him.

15:50.110 --> 15:51.678
That bitch don't play.

15:51.678 --> 15:56.183
So you...don't worry about me
ever pushing up on you.

15:56.183 --> 15:58.685
Your fine, sexy, ass--
it's gonna be hard,

15:58.685 --> 16:00.587
but I ain't never gonna push up
on your fine ass.

16:00.587 --> 16:04.157
I will never -- your --,
ever, because she'll kill me.

16:04.157 --> 16:05.992
And I love my life.

16:05.992 --> 16:07.227
I love your life too, Deja.

16:07.227 --> 16:10.063
I love my life, and I love--
it don't matter.

16:10.397 --> 16:12.499
I love it.
Don't worry about it.

16:12.499 --> 16:14.034
I just...I just wanted to help
you Zac.

16:14.034 --> 16:15.268
I don't want no problems.

16:15.268 --> 16:18.438
I'm good, Deja, can I go?
I appreciate you.

16:18.438 --> 16:19.539
Wait, Zac.

16:20.006 --> 16:22.309
Listen, I just wanted to warn
you, okay.

16:22.309 --> 16:23.677
-Warn me?
[Deja] Your girl--

16:23.677 --> 16:26.713
the apple of your eye--
she might be a orange.

16:26.713 --> 16:30.517
She comes from a long line of
killers and dealers.

16:30.517 --> 16:32.419
Trust me, okay?

16:32.419 --> 16:35.021
You might want to meet your
in-laws before you say,

16:35.021 --> 16:36.456
-I do, y'all.
-Okay--

16:36.456 --> 16:37.824
[Deja] You feel me?
You with me?

16:37.824 --> 16:39.326

16:39.326 --> 16:41.294
Wait, y'all are still engaged?
Y'all...y'all are engaged--

16:41.294 --> 16:42.762
[Zac]<i> Yes.
</i>-I know--

16:42.762 --> 16:43.763
[Zac] Not that that's your
business.

16:43.763 --> 16:45.165
It's not my business, right.

16:46.099 --> 16:47.934
-Ooh, them bags is heavy?
-No, no they not heavy.

16:47.934 --> 16:49.436
I got 'em.

16:49.436 --> 16:51.071
You got the eggs all smooshed.
Just let me grab it.

16:51.071 --> 16:53.106
Do not touch my bags!

16:54.474 --> 16:55.842
Deja, please!

16:56.610 --> 16:59.012
You know what, I came out here
to be a friend and warn you

16:59.012 --> 17:01.515
about your fiancé who's not
really givin' fiancé

17:01.515 --> 17:03.917
cause sometimes she wears her
ring and sometimes she don't.

17:03.917 --> 17:07.821
So it's givin, very much put a
ring on it, very much single,

17:07.821 --> 17:09.122
very much outside.

17:09.122 --> 17:11.124
Okay, what did you say
Madam looked like?

17:11.124 --> 17:12.592
Light skin, green eyes,
short hair, why?

17:12.592 --> 17:15.061
Oh, shit!
Oh, go, now!

17:15.061 --> 17:16.229
Stop playing with me!

17:16.229 --> 17:18.431
Go, Deja, go!
Madam's outside!

17:18.431 --> 17:21.101
Madam's outside.
Everybody get down,

17:21.101 --> 17:22.869
the Madam's is inside.

17:22.869 --> 17:24.538
[music]

17:25.705 --> 17:30.644
Ah! The Madam! Oh no, don't go
back outside, the Madam!

17:30.644 --> 17:32.679
Ah!

17:38.485 --> 17:39.686
[knock on door]

17:46.493 --> 17:47.694
Hey.

17:48.094 --> 17:50.897
Did um...did my mama call you?
Come in.

17:50.897 --> 17:51.831
She did,

17:51.831 --> 17:52.832
-Oh.
-Yeah.

17:52.832 --> 17:54.334
Okay, uh...

17:55.569 --> 17:58.171
Well, the girls are coming to
check on me.

17:58.672 --> 18:00.874
Yeah, she told me they'd be here
in a little bit.

18:01.174 --> 18:05.045
Yeah...yeah...
on the way, so...

18:05.045 --> 18:06.880
So, do you not need me here
then?

18:07.247 --> 18:11.785
Um...I mean...I think
they can handle it.

18:11.785 --> 18:14.254
Mmm...not quite sure.

18:14.854 --> 18:15.789
Why?

18:16.656 --> 18:18.491
Well, first of all, they don't
know your favorite ice cream

18:18.491 --> 18:20.493
-like I do.
-Oh, I see, yeah.

18:20.493 --> 18:24.698
-Well, they do, actually.
-They do...okay, cool.

18:25.398 --> 18:28.635
But...can they rub your feet
like me?

18:29.903 --> 18:31.871
They're definitely not doing
that, that's for sure.

18:31.871 --> 18:33.373
Right, see, I rest my case.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.108
-Okay, all right, you win.
-Okay, perfect.

18:35.108 --> 18:36.409
You win.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.212
Um...

18:39.212 --> 18:40.580
you brought a bag?

18:41.147 --> 18:42.649
Yeah, I'm moving in.

18:42.649 --> 18:44.784
Oh, Aaron...uh...

18:44.784 --> 18:48.154
Listen, I'm here to serve you...
like a princess.

18:48.855 --> 18:51.458
Well, thank you, but I'm fine.

18:51.958 --> 18:55.428
Well, once the doctor says your
fine, then I'll know for sure.

18:55.428 --> 18:59.699
Mmm, well...Pam is going to get
me an appointment, so...

18:59.699 --> 19:02.302
I'm sure you already knew that
though.

19:02.636 --> 19:04.371
-What?
-Aaron, I know your doctor

19:04.371 --> 19:06.740
friend told you I was in the
hospital.

19:08.008 --> 19:10.310
-Don't even say anything.
-Uh, yeah.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.645
Don't mention it to him.

19:12.178 --> 19:13.613
That was not cool, okay.

19:13.613 --> 19:15.348
-Don't do that again.
-I get it.

19:15.348 --> 19:16.716
I get it.
I understand.

19:16.716 --> 19:17.751
Good.

19:19.085 --> 19:22.255
Well, what do you want to do?

19:23.223 --> 19:25.225
I'll be in this house all day
and night.

19:26.026 --> 19:27.227
I understand that.

19:27.227 --> 19:28.461
If my mama found out that I left

19:28.461 --> 19:31.398
she would drag me back
[unintelligible].

19:32.532 --> 19:37.003
Yeah, that she would do.
She called me, like, five times.

19:37.003 --> 19:38.304
-What?
-Yeah.

19:38.304 --> 19:40.407
-Why?
-To make sure I was here

19:40.407 --> 19:41.908
and to see what was going on.

19:42.609 --> 19:46.012
-Shit, she is on it.
-She stays on it.

19:46.012 --> 19:47.747
I'm surprised she ain't tracking
my phone.

19:48.548 --> 19:49.816
She might be.

19:51.751 --> 19:56.156
Well, I mean, the girls will be
here soon so...

19:56.156 --> 19:59.726
-I would love it if you could...
-Get lost.

20:00.794 --> 20:01.895
Yeah.

20:03.329 --> 20:06.332
Look, I promise...this can be
easy.

20:06.332 --> 20:08.268
It won't even take that long.

20:10.003 --> 20:11.171
Okay.

20:12.038 --> 20:13.306
Fine.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.209
-Okay.
-Yeah.

20:16.209 --> 20:18.344
So... dinner then?

20:19.112 --> 20:20.413
Last night...

20:21.014 --> 20:22.248
What?

20:25.051 --> 20:28.154
Do you want to
talk about last night?

20:29.756 --> 20:31.791
Do you want to talk
about last night?

20:33.326 --> 20:36.229
I mean...you heard what I said,
so...

20:36.229 --> 20:38.732
Yeah, and you heard what I said.

20:39.766 --> 20:42.969
Well, I heard a little bit of
what you said.

20:42.969 --> 20:45.872
I mean, honestly, that's what I
got for you right now.

20:46.773 --> 20:48.007
That's it?

20:48.007 --> 20:48.942
Yeah.

20:49.542 --> 20:51.611
Come on, baby, it's me and you.

20:55.248 --> 20:58.518
You know, I read this article...

20:58.518 --> 21:03.790
that you can really get to know
a man through his phone.

21:04.758 --> 21:05.859
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

21:06.392 --> 21:09.963
Like, you know, his pictures
and text messages.

21:10.597 --> 21:12.699
-I could see that.
-Mmm.

21:12.699 --> 21:14.100
Yeah.

21:14.100 --> 21:18.404
So if you want to know somebody,
you know, you could just...

21:18.404 --> 21:20.940
ask them or...

21:20.940 --> 21:22.776
go through their phone.

21:22.776 --> 21:23.943
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

21:23.943 --> 21:26.146
I mean, if they're willing to
let you do that.

21:26.146 --> 21:30.483
Oh, yeah, of course, that would
be a breech of privacy.

21:30.483 --> 21:32.185
Yeah, just...just a little bit.

21:32.185 --> 21:34.287
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:36.256 --> 21:39.592
So, do you want to see my phone?

21:39.893 --> 21:40.860
What?

21:41.361 --> 21:42.996
I mean, why are you
bringing it up?

21:42.996 --> 21:44.264
-Is that what you want?
-No.

21:44.731 --> 21:46.032
No?
You sure?

21:46.032 --> 21:47.267
Yeah, I'm sure.

21:51.404 --> 21:54.607
"How to know somebody
through their phone."

21:55.975 --> 21:57.010
Is this it?

21:57.010 --> 21:59.412
First one that pops up?

22:00.346 --> 22:03.082
Yeah, my mama sent it to me.

22:03.082 --> 22:04.350
-Mama sent it to you, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

22:04.350 --> 22:06.219
Mama be on it.

22:06.219 --> 22:07.420
She do.

22:07.787 --> 22:09.856
Okay...so...

22:10.423 --> 22:11.991
did you want to see my phone?

22:11.991 --> 22:13.159
No, I don't.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.729
Okay, then how about we figure
out what we're going to

22:16.729 --> 22:19.032
-do for dinner.
-Your phone.

22:19.032 --> 22:20.066
-Thought so.
-Mm-hmm.

22:20.066 --> 22:21.868
Mm-hmm.

22:22.902 --> 22:26.606
Okay, well,
I'ma start making dinner.

22:28.241 --> 22:29.676
What's your pass code?

22:30.143 --> 22:31.544
9-8-3-3.

22:34.881 --> 22:36.482
Okay, thank you.

22:36.783 --> 22:38.952
-Okay...let me get started.
-Mm-hmm.

22:41.154 --> 22:42.789
So do you want
chicken or steak?

22:43.423 --> 22:45.091
I wanna look through your phone.

22:46.092 --> 22:49.562
Okay, but since that won't fill
you up, which one do you want?

22:50.363 --> 22:51.965
And your emails.

22:52.966 --> 22:53.933
Steak it is.

22:54.534 --> 22:56.836
Pasta.
I want pasta.

22:57.871 --> 22:59.572
-Pasta.
-Mm-hmm.

22:59.572 --> 23:01.140
Okay, but I didn't get pasta.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.342
Mmm.

23:02.909 --> 23:04.744
But...I can go get it.

23:05.879 --> 23:07.380
Yeah, that'd be great.

23:09.048 --> 23:10.283
Okay...

23:10.283 --> 23:11.918
I'll go get it.

23:11.918 --> 23:14.354
Wait, what kind of pasta?

23:14.354 --> 23:17.056
Oh, uh, angel hair, yeah.

23:17.357 --> 23:19.826
Angel hair...got it.

23:20.126 --> 23:21.494
You're forgetting your phone.

23:22.629 --> 23:25.231
Keep it.
Knock yourself out.

23:25.231 --> 23:26.699
[music]

23:28.067 --> 23:29.769
I damn sure will.

23:30.637 --> 23:31.638
Shit, Zac would never
do this shit.

23:35.392 --> 23:36.626
[line trilling]

23:39.863 --> 23:41.798
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:42.599 --> 23:44.100
Can I tell you something?

23:45.402 --> 23:48.538
Yeah, I was actually calling to
tell you something, though.

23:48.538 --> 23:51.975
Do you know how hard it is for
me not to call you?

23:55.145 --> 23:56.112
Okay.

23:56.346 --> 23:57.681
I mean it.

23:58.615 --> 24:00.050
All right, Preston.

24:00.984 --> 24:03.853
I'm sorry, Danni,
why'd you call again?

24:04.320 --> 24:06.389
Uh, is there a moment
that we can talk?

24:06.756 --> 24:08.825
I can get on a plane today.

24:10.026 --> 24:11.061
Okay.

24:11.661 --> 24:12.896
Where do you wanna meet?

24:12.896 --> 24:15.565
Well, you can just
meet at my house.

24:16.032 --> 24:17.267
Done.

24:17.267 --> 24:19.736
In fr-- front of my house,
though.

24:21.404 --> 24:23.840
On the street, okay, I got it.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.911
Yeah.
Can you...can you drive?

24:28.278 --> 24:30.380
[Preston]<i> Also done.</i>

24:31.514 --> 24:33.850
Yeah, I'll see you later.

24:33.850 --> 24:35.952
Hey, well, look...
thanks for calling.

24:36.553 --> 24:37.854
See you later.

24:42.225 --> 24:43.927
This is light work.

24:43.927 --> 24:44.828
What?

24:45.361 --> 24:47.130
This job is light work.

24:47.130 --> 24:48.565
Oh, yeah.

24:49.299 --> 24:50.767
You okay?

24:50.767 --> 24:51.868
Fine.

24:52.469 --> 24:53.837
Yes, you are.

24:55.371 --> 24:58.541
-Can you go somewhere, like--
-I'm sorry.

24:59.242 --> 25:01.244
Like I didn't--

25:01.244 --> 25:03.079
I can't deal with that shit
today.

25:03.079 --> 25:04.581
Okay, I'm sorry.

25:05.582 --> 25:07.550
Like, don't you have something
to do, or...

25:07.550 --> 25:10.120
I'm supposed to be here, the
planes coming.

25:10.820 --> 25:12.722
All right, can you wait over
there?

25:13.356 --> 25:14.991
Yeah, okay.

25:29.272 --> 25:30.573
You know this dude?

25:31.741 --> 25:33.710
Why he looking at you
crazy like that?

25:34.644 --> 25:36.179
Can you just--

25:36.880 --> 25:38.915
I just don't like the way he's
starring at you, that's all.

25:40.049 --> 25:41.684
You just got this job.

25:41.684 --> 25:43.253
You're gonna want to
shut the hell up.

25:43.653 --> 25:44.921
Okay, fine.

25:48.091 --> 25:49.259
Is the flight on time?

25:49.726 --> 25:51.694
It's fifteen minutes delay.

25:51.694 --> 25:52.929
Is it outbound?

25:56.633 --> 25:58.468
Then why the hell
is he sitting there?

26:01.304 --> 26:02.605
I don't know.

26:06.342 --> 26:08.178
I'm gonna go talk to this --.

26:08.578 --> 26:09.746
Mm-mm, no.

26:09.746 --> 26:11.648
-Yo, yo...
-What?

26:11.648 --> 26:14.050
-Gate's closed.
-I'm waiting on something.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.084
What?

26:16.085 --> 26:17.587
Who are you?

26:17.587 --> 26:19.589
I'm the man who works here.
What can I do you for?

26:19.956 --> 26:21.157
I'm good.

26:24.427 --> 26:26.529
You see this ankle monitor here?

26:27.330 --> 26:29.399
-Hey--
-I said I'm good.

26:29.399 --> 26:30.834
-You see it?
-I said I'm good.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.735
You see this ankle monitor here?

26:32.735 --> 26:36.706
I just started working here
and I'm looking to get fired.

26:37.574 --> 26:39.742
-- you over will
be just what I need.

26:42.645 --> 26:44.614
So you wanna talk to me?

26:47.150 --> 26:49.619
Oh, you're looking at me now,
right.

26:50.553 --> 26:53.022
My son's on the plane coming in.

26:53.489 --> 26:56.192
-I'm waiting on him, okay?
-All right.

26:56.526 --> 26:58.228
-Yeah.
-Okay.

26:58.228 --> 26:59.596
-I got you.
-Okay.

26:59.596 --> 27:01.631
Okay?
Okay.

27:09.172 --> 27:10.540
Why'd you do that?

27:11.107 --> 27:12.642
I was just checking.

27:13.209 --> 27:14.177
Well, don't.

27:14.611 --> 27:15.879
Okay, fine.

27:16.512 --> 27:18.214
He said his son
was on the flight.

27:18.882 --> 27:20.650
-His son.
-Yeah.

27:28.491 --> 27:29.692
Yeah.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.796
There's a solo child
traveling on this flight.

27:33.796 --> 27:35.231
Oh, so he is legit.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.234
For now.

27:39.102 --> 27:40.904
Damn, I was hoping he wasn't.

27:42.639 --> 27:44.274
Wh--why?

27:44.574 --> 27:46.576
I wanted to bust that head open.

27:46.576 --> 27:48.778
-What is wrong with you?
-Nothing.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.980
I don't want this job.
I want to be fired.

27:51.247 --> 27:52.682
Then just quit.

27:52.682 --> 27:54.217
Then I'll be arrested.

27:55.952 --> 27:57.020
Why?

27:58.288 --> 27:59.322
Why what?

28:00.223 --> 28:02.625
Why would you be arrested
if you quit?

28:03.326 --> 28:07.063
Long story but...
I got to keep a job for a while.

28:08.031 --> 28:10.066
Okay.

28:10.066 --> 28:13.102
Well, keep the job
somewhere else.

28:14.237 --> 28:15.204
Okay.

28:18.341 --> 28:21.778
Okay.
God, -- always.

28:21.778 --> 28:24.147
I'm just not in the mood for
this shit today.

28:26.716 --> 28:28.685
[suspenseful music]

28:35.725 --> 28:37.594
-Hey.
-Hey, Andi.

28:38.328 --> 28:41.131
-What you doing?
-About to leave work in a bit.

28:41.998 --> 28:43.500
Oh, good.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.668
What are you doing?

28:45.435 --> 28:51.141
Well, Aaron was at my house,
and he left his phone with me.

28:51.675 --> 28:52.809
What?!

28:53.477 --> 28:57.013
Yeah, I was telling him about
this article that I found

28:57.013 --> 29:00.417
where, you know, you can learn a
lot about a person by going

29:00.417 --> 29:01.685
through their phone.

29:02.752 --> 29:05.188
So he left it with me--
gave me his password--

29:05.188 --> 29:07.324
and I've been going through it
for, like, an hour now.

29:07.324 --> 29:09.960
-Uh-uh.
-Yeah.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.261
Why are you doing that?

29:11.928 --> 29:15.065
-Girl, there's something up.
-What?

29:15.065 --> 29:18.502
No, I'm telling you the truth.
My mama felt it too.

29:19.135 --> 29:22.973
Something's not right about him,
or you don't want something to

29:22.973 --> 29:24.107
be right about him.

29:24.708 --> 29:26.843
I'm telling you, okay.
I'm going to find it.

29:27.277 --> 29:30.347
Okay...well, what did you find
in his phone?

29:31.648 --> 29:32.916
Nothing.

29:34.384 --> 29:35.819
That's good, right?

29:35.819 --> 29:39.756
No, but nothing, like--
no women, no random chicks,

29:39.756 --> 29:41.825
no crazy pictures...nothing.

29:41.825 --> 29:43.793
Well, there you have it.

29:43.793 --> 29:45.328
You're probably right.

29:45.328 --> 29:48.765
Karen, stop trying to make
something wrong with that man.

29:49.065 --> 29:50.534
You're right, I know.

29:50.534 --> 29:51.868
I'm always right.

29:51.868 --> 29:54.037
[Karen]<i> Hmm, you got the crazy
one now,</i>

29:54.037 --> 29:58.008
and I got one with no drama, and
here I am looking for it.

30:01.077 --> 30:03.013
It's probably all those years
with Zac.

30:03.346 --> 30:04.447
Yeah.

30:04.748 --> 30:07.284
So, just go with it.

30:08.118 --> 30:09.052
Okay.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.256
Well, speaking of Zac...

30:13.890 --> 30:16.159
did your friend tell you what
happened last night?

30:16.159 --> 30:19.829
Okay, see, I think that's my cue
to get off the phone.

30:19.829 --> 30:21.331
Hey, wait, wait.

30:21.698 --> 30:23.867
Y'all coming over later?

30:28.438 --> 30:31.174
well, Brina ain't answering my
calls, so...

30:32.008 --> 30:34.945
I know that Danni and I
will be there.

30:35.812 --> 30:37.781
What's going on?

30:38.315 --> 30:39.382
Nothing.

30:39.916 --> 30:41.952
Andi, what's going on?
Where's Brina?

30:42.452 --> 30:45.055
You know what, I'll call her and
see if she answers.

30:45.889 --> 30:47.624
Call her on three-way now.

30:47.624 --> 30:51.261
Actually, girl, I have to go.
Something just came up.

30:51.661 --> 30:54.564
-Fine.
-I'll call you back, bye.

30:54.564 --> 30:55.832

What's going on?

31:05.408 --> 31:06.643
-Hey.
-Hey, girl.

31:07.010 --> 31:08.278
I thought you were gone for the
day.

31:08.278 --> 31:11.214
-Oh, I left my wallet.
-Oh, okay.

31:11.514 --> 31:12.682
Where you headed?

31:12.682 --> 31:13.917
-To see Sabrina.
-Oh, okay.

31:13.917 --> 31:15.151
-Yeah.
-Well, I'll see you

31:15.151 --> 31:16.519
-in the morning.
-I'll see you in the morning.

31:16.519 --> 31:17.887
-All right, have a goodnight.
-Bye, girl.

31:17.887 --> 31:19.356
-Goodnight.
-All right.

31:21.324 --> 31:22.225
What the hell?

31:23.827 --> 31:24.995
Hey.

31:25.996 --> 31:27.364
Heather, what are you
doing here?

31:27.831 --> 31:30.033
I came here to see my lawyer.

31:31.801 --> 31:34.037
-Your lawyer?
-Yeah.

31:34.471 --> 31:35.905
What lawyer?

31:37.707 --> 31:39.542
Why do you need to know?

31:39.843 --> 31:41.478
Heather, why are you here?

31:41.945 --> 31:44.381
Wait...so you work here?

31:44.381 --> 31:47.951
No...I'm just standing here
looking cute.

31:47.951 --> 31:51.154
Damn, you ain't gotta be all
hostile.

31:51.655 --> 31:52.589
Girl...

31:53.123 --> 31:56.826
Well...you saw the DNA results,
right?

31:57.694 --> 32:00.063
Heather, cut the shit.
What are you really doing here?

32:02.098 --> 32:04.534
Hello.
Heather, I presume.

32:04.534 --> 32:05.902
Yeah.

32:05.902 --> 32:07.437
How are doing?
Please, come in to my office.

32:07.437 --> 32:08.738
Okay, bet.

32:08.738 --> 32:10.940
I'm Hayden, nice to me you.
So just go down the hall,

32:10.940 --> 32:12.842
make a left, my name will be
on the door.

32:12.842 --> 32:13.910
I'll be right there, okay?

32:13.910 --> 32:15.512
Hayden, right?

32:15.512 --> 32:16.813
Hayden, yeah.

32:16.813 --> 32:17.981
How you spell that?

32:18.381 --> 32:21.151
H-A-Y-D-E-N.

32:21.418 --> 32:24.821
H-A-Y-D-E-N.

32:24.821 --> 32:26.523
-Yeah.
-Okay, thank you.

32:26.523 --> 32:30.060
-Of course, I'll be right there.
-[Heather]<i> H-A-Y-D-A-N.</i>

32:30.060 --> 32:32.395
A-N...why she can't
even -- spell.

32:32.395 --> 32:34.864
-[Hayden]<i> It's E-N.
</i>-[Heather]<i> E-N, okay.</i>

32:34.864 --> 32:36.232
-It's D-E-N.
-[Heather] Okay.

32:36.232 --> 32:38.201
Okay, I'll be right there.

32:39.436 --> 32:42.005
She's nice, huh?

32:42.005 --> 32:43.139
You wanna hear something funny?

32:43.139 --> 32:44.974
I'm looking at something funny.

32:44.974 --> 32:46.376
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

32:46.376 --> 32:48.645
So this girl, she works at a
strip club, right?

32:49.279 --> 32:51.681
And she's dating somebody
from Chainbreakers.

32:52.582 --> 32:54.217
So one of the fellas,
they come to me

32:54.718 --> 32:57.954
they say she needs a lawyer for
her baby's father.

32:58.288 --> 33:00.290
Now, I wasn't interested in
that.

33:00.290 --> 33:01.791
You know, it sounded like some

33:01.791 --> 33:03.293
ghetto hood-rat shit to
me, you know.

33:03.827 --> 33:08.631
But then, the baby's father's
name is Zachary Taylor.

33:08.631 --> 33:09.799
Could you believe that?

33:10.366 --> 33:14.070
So I was like, of course, I will
absolutely help her

33:14.070 --> 33:16.206
with this case.
No problem.

33:18.241 --> 33:19.309
Hayden...

33:19.309 --> 33:20.910
you're going to burn in hell.

33:20.910 --> 33:22.112
Oh, I know.

33:22.112 --> 33:23.646
And I'ma look good doing it.

33:26.783 --> 33:28.918
-Hayden...
-Your boy getting sued.

33:28.918 --> 33:30.220
You know that, right?

33:30.220 --> 33:32.288
--, you're not even
a family attorney.

33:32.288 --> 33:34.724
I'll be whatever kind of
attorney I need to be to make

33:34.724 --> 33:36.860
sure that -- get locked up.

33:37.193 --> 33:38.561
You have a good night.

33:39.028 --> 33:40.663
[Hayden] Ah, no, that's the
bathroom.

33:40.663 --> 33:42.031
Yeah, it's to the left.

33:44.076 --> 33:46.078
[heavy exhales]

33:46.712 --> 33:47.980
What?

33:47.980 --> 33:50.349
Can't believe they let me in
here.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.985
Would you just look official?

33:53.251 --> 33:55.253
I look official...right?

33:56.054 --> 33:58.223
More like an official porn star.
Um...

33:59.992 --> 34:02.761
I just...I just...
isn't this illegal?

34:02.761 --> 34:03.895
(whispering) It's very illegal.

34:03.895 --> 34:05.430
Just be quiet they may be
recording us.

34:05.430 --> 34:08.133
Yeah, I'm not an attorney.
I'm a paralegal.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.702
You are my paralegal.
It's perfect.

34:12.671 --> 34:13.672
Great.

34:14.606 --> 34:15.841
[heavy exhales]

34:15.841 --> 34:18.343
Am I working late this weekend?

34:18.343 --> 34:20.112
I've never committed
a crime before.

34:21.213 --> 34:22.714
What did you just do?

34:23.081 --> 34:24.716
It was a joke.
You told me a porn star.

34:24.716 --> 34:25.817
Oh, my gosh.

34:25.817 --> 34:27.119
I know, she has to--

34:27.619 --> 34:29.654
[clears throat]
Hey.

34:31.089 --> 34:33.025
-Mrs. King?
-Yes.

34:33.025 --> 34:34.259
Right.

34:34.259 --> 34:36.628
We will let the kind officer
leave.

34:44.069 --> 34:46.505
Damn, they chaining you up and
shit.

34:46.505 --> 34:48.106
I know.

34:48.106 --> 34:49.408
I'm sorry.

34:50.675 --> 34:51.643
This is awful.

34:53.445 --> 34:54.780
How are you?

34:54.780 --> 34:56.114
Not good.

34:56.982 --> 34:58.450
I know.

34:59.418 --> 35:02.020
-This is not good.
-I know, I know.

35:03.822 --> 35:05.123
I don't even know
why I'm in here.

35:05.123 --> 35:06.558
I didn't even do anything.

35:06.558 --> 35:08.293
We've been trying to get you.
You gotta believe us.

35:09.027 --> 35:10.562
I know.

35:12.831 --> 35:15.634
-Shit.
-We know you're not okay.

35:15.634 --> 35:18.603
Do you even know what happened?
Why am I here?

35:20.472 --> 35:22.340
-Andi do you--
-Andi just tell her.

35:22.340 --> 35:24.543
If you know something just
please tell me.

35:26.011 --> 35:28.447
-It was--
-What the hell is going on.

35:28.447 --> 35:32.918
Yep, I'm sorry.
It was the guy Maurice was with.

35:33.251 --> 35:35.720
He has a recording of Maurice

35:35.720 --> 35:40.492
that says that it was you and
his idea to rob the bank.

35:42.127 --> 35:44.396
(whimpering) No, you gotta be
kidding.

35:45.564 --> 35:46.898
I'm not.

35:46.898 --> 35:49.534
What the hell is happening?

35:49.901 --> 35:51.369
This can't be real.

35:51.970 --> 35:54.473
They are...treating it
like it is.

35:55.340 --> 35:57.542
-This is insane.
-No, listen, I am going to

35:57.542 --> 35:59.744
get you help.
We are going to get you help.

36:00.445 --> 36:01.546
Okay?

36:02.414 --> 36:06.318
Look, whatever you do just...
don't tell my mom, okay?

-We don't have to do that, no.
-No, no.

-Yeah.

36:21.733 --> 36:22.767
How?

36:23.702 --> 36:26.638
I...I'm trying everything I can
right now, Sabrina.

36:26.638 --> 36:28.273
Trust me, I am.

36:30.208 --> 36:32.644
The people in here are just so
mean.

36:32.644 --> 36:34.346
It's jail, man.

36:37.816 --> 36:40.418
I'm not trying to be--
I'm not trying to be funny.

36:40.752 --> 36:42.587
I'm saying jail makes people
mean.

36:42.587 --> 36:43.822
I'm not...

36:44.055 --> 36:45.423
They cut off all my hair.

36:45.423 --> 36:48.293
Okay...don't worry about that
right now.

36:48.593 --> 36:50.729
-Your hair is beautiful.
-Mm-hmm.

36:51.129 --> 36:52.597
What if I don't get out?

36:52.597 --> 36:53.999
Oh, no, no, no.

36:54.266 --> 36:56.001
-You will get out.
-Yeah.

36:56.001 --> 36:57.202
How do you know that?

36:57.202 --> 36:59.037
-I know you will get out.
-Mm-hmm.

36:59.337 --> 37:01.239
And your natural hair is
beautiful.

37:01.239 --> 37:03.074
That's not the point.

37:03.074 --> 37:04.709
-She's right.
-Danni!

37:05.577 --> 37:08.046
The point is that they put me in
here, and they cut off my hair,

37:08.046 --> 37:10.348
and I didn't even do anything.

37:10.348 --> 37:12.150
We are going to get you out.

37:12.150 --> 37:13.752
How, Andi?

37:14.186 --> 37:15.220
How?

37:15.220 --> 37:17.055
I'm making every call I can.

37:17.055 --> 37:19.424
I am trying everything I can,
okay?

37:21.359 --> 37:22.827
What about your boss, Robin?

37:22.827 --> 37:26.932
Didn't...didn't he help Zac and
Fatima or something?

37:26.932 --> 37:28.733
Can...I mean, can he help me?

37:29.301 --> 37:31.703
He may be able to.
It's complicated.

37:32.938 --> 37:34.606
Have you not asked him yet?

37:34.606 --> 37:36.441
I... I did.
I asked him.

37:36.441 --> 37:38.109
Well, what did he say?

37:38.777 --> 37:42.380
Sabrina, this case is federal...
and it's very different.

37:43.081 --> 37:47.519
I just...I just need you to
relax and let it play out.

37:47.519 --> 37:48.954
-Relax?!
-[Andi] I know.

37:48.954 --> 37:50.255
-Relax?!
-[Andi] I know, I know.

37:50.255 --> 37:52.357
You know the people at my job
think I did this.

37:54.025 --> 37:55.894
This is so ridiculous.

37:59.130 --> 38:01.566
I was told you were in here.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.235
[clears throat]

38:03.235 --> 38:04.703
-John Williams.
-Hi.

38:05.403 --> 38:07.539
-Andi Barnes.
-I know your name.

38:08.106 --> 38:09.040
You do?

38:09.641 --> 38:11.543
You don't recognize me, do you?

38:12.944 --> 38:15.280
I can't say that I do.

38:16.248 --> 38:18.250
You represented my wife...

38:18.617 --> 38:21.253
-in our divorce.
-Oh, shit.

38:21.653 --> 38:23.755
That was before I was a
prosecutor.

38:24.623 --> 38:25.523
I see.

38:25.523 --> 38:27.225
Are you her lawyer?

38:28.293 --> 38:29.861
One of them.

38:32.297 --> 38:34.266
There's no other attorney on
record.

38:34.933 --> 38:38.670
We are retaining more attorneys
as we speak.

38:38.670 --> 38:41.439
Hmm.
Would you like to talk outside?

38:42.340 --> 38:44.442
No, I want to hear.

38:46.711 --> 38:50.282

okay?

treating you?

39:12.370 --> 39:14.005

39:15.607 --> 39:19.177
Um...I'm sorry, I have a lot of
clients, so...

39:19.177 --> 39:20.645
Do you remember my wife?

39:22.314 --> 39:26.284

yeah.

39:26.651 --> 39:30.588
Ah...so then, my life was
nothing to you.

39:31.222 --> 39:32.724
I'm sorry?

39:32.724 --> 39:36.494
Hmm, I mean, the amount of money
I have to pay her now.

39:39.097 --> 39:41.933
Do you know that she has a
boyfriend living in my house

39:41.933 --> 39:45.603
and won't marry him because my
alimony would stop.

39:47.672 --> 39:50.542
I'm sorry but I thought we were
going to talk about Sabrina.

39:50.542 --> 39:53.745
Yes, your client and friend.

39:54.679 --> 39:56.614
And how did you know she was my
friend?

39:57.182 --> 39:58.450
Judge Ross.

40:00.719 --> 40:01.953
Tell me...how can you represent

40:01.953 --> 40:04.556
her, being a divorce attorney
and all?

40:05.890 --> 40:09.160
There are a lot of lawyers at my
firm.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.662
-Hmm.
-So, uh...

40:11.262 --> 40:15.600
Uh, I thought we could discuss
maybe bail for Sabrina.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.769
Yeah, she's not getting out.

40:18.903 --> 40:20.138
Excuse me?

40:20.805 --> 40:24.776
Judge Ross called me and said
she was not getting out.

40:26.010 --> 40:27.612
Are you serious?

40:29.247 --> 40:30.181
Yeah.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.350
Sabrina is innocent.

40:32.684 --> 40:34.719
Your not a criminal attorney.

40:35.186 --> 40:37.689
You should take your friend,
who's not a paralegal

40:37.689 --> 40:40.291
and get out of here before I
have you arrested for

40:40.291 --> 40:41.626
impersonating.

40:42.527 --> 40:46.097
-John...
-Oh, she calls me by my name.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.367
Look...

40:50.769 --> 40:53.405
working with your wife was my
job.

40:53.938 --> 40:55.306
This is just unfair.

40:55.673 --> 40:57.675
This has nothing to do with my
wife.

40:59.010 --> 41:00.044
Exactly.

41:00.612 --> 41:03.214
So let's just discuss bail and
stick to the case.

41:03.214 --> 41:06.551
We can discuss you leaving and
sending in a criminal attorney.

41:07.452 --> 41:08.953
Okay, John.

41:08.953 --> 41:11.790
Or we can talk about the thirty
years I'm asking for.

41:13.191 --> 41:14.592
Are you serious?

41:15.360 --> 41:20.331
She's staying here for a very
long time.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.167
[suspenseful music]

41:26.863 --> 41:29.600

-What?!

Maurice is gonna tell the truth.

41:33.170 --> 41:34.972
What if they keep me in here?

41:34.972 --> 41:36.039
They won't.

I can help.</i>

-Yes...hey, I'm sorry, again.

41:40.310 --> 41:41.511
Just help my friend.

41:41.511 --> 41:43.447

want you on my team.

41:44.248 --> 41:45.582
Come on, man.

41:45.582 --> 41:48.151
Well, I certainly don't want
you on my team.
