00:36.960 --> 00:38.166
Hello? This is
Sandy Patterson.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.446
<i>Yes, Mr. Patterson.</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:42.041
<i>I'm Janine from the
Fraud Protection Department</i>

00:42.120 --> 00:44.088
<i>of Identi-vault
Credit Monitoring Service.</i>

00:44.240 --> 00:46.083
<i>We're calling today
because, unfortunately,</i>

00:46.160 --> 00:49.528
<i>it appears that someone has
attempted to steal your identity.</i>

00:49.640 --> 00:50.641
Are you kidding me?

00:50.760 --> 00:54.446
<i>Gosh, I wish I were. We did
catch this in time, however.</i>

00:54.520 --> 00:56.727
<i>But I do suggest
you taking advantage</i>

00:56.800 --> 00:59.007
<i>of our free total
protection plan,</i>

00:59.200 --> 01:02.921
<i>which safeguards your credit
rating against theft and fraud.</i>

01:03.080 --> 01:05.890
Yes, please.
If it's free, absolutely.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.810
<i>Just terrific.
I went for this plan myself.</i>

01:09.000 --> 01:10.570
<i>Mr. Patterson,
I'm gonna need to</i>

01:10.640 --> 01:12.210
<i>verify some
information from you.</i>

01:12.440 --> 01:15.364
I'm gonna need your
full name, date of birth,

01:15.520 --> 01:18.126
and Social Security
number, please.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.884
<i>Sure, understood.
Here it comes.</i>

01:53.360 --> 01:54.407
What can I get for you?

01:54.480 --> 01:55.641
I'm gonna have a melon ball.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.842
And some tequila.
And let's start a tab.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.729
You got it.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.006
And keep it open.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.330
My friends can't make it.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.525
Here I am, stuck with all these
premium tequila shots, so...

02:12.680 --> 02:14.728
That's what we're drinking.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.041
No.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.287
My name's Sandy.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.407
Hi, Sandy.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.369
Okay. Cheers.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.681
Mmm!

02:22.400 --> 02:23.686
Let's get another round.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.765
Chug! Chug! Chug!

02:31.240 --> 02:33.129
Another round on me!

02:34.240 --> 02:35.730
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

02:35.920 --> 02:36.887
Who the hell is she?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.610
Who cares?
She's buying free drinks.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.281
Let's go!

02:44.040 --> 02:46.247
When I say "Sandy,"
you say "Patterson."

02:46.400 --> 02:48.289
- Sandy!
- Patterson!

02:48.360 --> 02:50.089
Sandy!
Patterson!

02:50.240 --> 02:51.924
Who wants another drink?

02:52.080 --> 02:53.764
We do!

02:55.480 --> 02:56.970
Enough. No more.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.724
Ma'am, get down.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.327
Who here wants to see me
swing on that chandelier?

03:04.960 --> 03:06.928
No, no, no.
You can't be up there.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.441
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.002
Uh, yeah, yeah, you can hear me,
because you're answering me.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.481
Whoa, I didn't hear that either.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.724
Here we go, bitches!

03:17.920 --> 03:19.763
Ma'am, you've gotta get down.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.241
Oh, shit.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.005
Whoo-hoo!

03:38.800 --> 03:40.290
Sandy! Sandy! Sandy!

03:40.440 --> 03:42.807
It's over.
Shaw's over, okay?

03:42.960 --> 03:45.486
You, you're out of here.
You're done, come on.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.449
No. You're out of here.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.047
Go back behind the bar and start
making more drinks for my friends.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.487
These aren't
your friends, okay?

03:53.640 --> 03:56.450
They like you because
you're buying them drinks.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.602
People like you
don't have friends.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.527
I think we're really hitting it off.
Don't you?

04:10.680 --> 04:11.681
Sandy Patterson.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.086
That's me.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.084
You're under arrest for assault
and public intoxication.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.844
I don't think that's accurate.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.571
Blow into this.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.165
Oh, my pleasure.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.681
How did I do?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.569
Huh. Look at that.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.927
Happy birthday,
Sandy Patterson.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.686
Shit.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.243
All right, cheese!
There it is.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.810
Happy birthday,
Sandy Patterson.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.001
Happy birthday, Daddy.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.440
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.082
Make a wish.
Here we go.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.681
Bravo!

04:53.760 --> 04:55.603
That's great. One lungful.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.886
I made you this, Daddy.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.008
Thank you. Look at that.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.366
Did you see that, Mommy?
I did.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.881
Looks very expensive.
Did you steal it?

05:03.240 --> 05:04.680
This looks very expensive.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.326
Little thief! You know what
happens to thieves? Huh?

05:07.480 --> 05:10.290
Let me tell you what happens to a thief.
This is your punishment.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.442
Be careful!
Just the face!

05:12.600 --> 05:15.604
There it is. That's what you get!

05:15.760 --> 05:19.685
Do you see?
Don't steal things.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.167
All right, let's get a knife,
I want to start on this.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.921
Come on, not on your birthday.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.324
After rent, utilities, gas and
phone, we saved a little this month.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.527
Ooh! How much?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.926
<i>$14.03.</i>

05:32.240 --> 05:33.685
Half of that's mine, you know.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.164
You're welcome.
Invest it wisely.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.402
What about your bonus?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.449
They got canceled again.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.480
It's the financial industry, I can't
exactly argue things are going well.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.763
You're gonna get promoted.
Mmm-hmm.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.841
You're going to.
It's fine, we're fine.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.565
I know.
We are pregnant, though.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.449
I'm pregnant.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.362
Look at me. We're fine.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.683
Until braces and
college and weddings.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.327
Maybe this one's a boy
and we can send him to work.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.528
Like, in a mine.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.170
Yeah. It's a reasonable plan.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.807
Oh!

06:19.880 --> 06:23.009
I have one more present
for you to unwrap.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.327
Oh!

06:24.800 --> 06:28.122
Why don't we... Let's go, let's go.
Let's go to a room.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.881
I rented a room in the back.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.250
Patterson.
Hi, good morning.

07:00.440 --> 07:01.521
Good morning.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.682
Hey. Did I ask you to pay for
the Westfield sweep account

07:03.800 --> 07:04.767
under the holding corp?

07:04.840 --> 07:05.841
Yeah.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.921
Shit. It was supposed to...

07:07.000 --> 07:08.490
Supposed to be
under the subsidiary,

07:08.560 --> 07:09.971
so you could roll over
the qualified plan.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.565
I did it both ways.
I had a feeling.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.404
I knew you would.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.607
I'll e-mail it to you.

07:14.680 --> 07:15.761
You're the best, Patterson.

07:15.840 --> 07:16.921
Sandy.
Yeah?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.884
Cornish wants you
in his office.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.568
Hey, cheese dick.
Cheese dick? Me?

07:27.680 --> 07:28.647
I wanna talk to you.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.807
You got a minute?
Yeah, sorry.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.291
What have you been up to?

07:31.440 --> 07:32.885
Oh, I just got here, actually.
Just starting...

07:33.040 --> 07:34.724
I got the thing.
Oh, you got the thing.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.406
Uh-huh. Well, we could go...

07:38.080 --> 07:39.809
Okay, well, we'll meet then.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.971
I'm gonna need you
to do something for me.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.041
That one mine?
Yeah, you.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.121
Anything.
She said come on in.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.201
All right, good.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.641
Was that...
Yes.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.531
You're not gonna. Good. All
right, thank you. You, too.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.090
You process all the
in-house accounts, right?

07:51.240 --> 07:52.207
I do.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.568
I need you to cut some
bonus checks for me.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.562
Bonus checks!
We have not...

07:58.720 --> 07:59.846
Oh, that's great.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.285
We have not had
them for three years,

08:01.360 --> 08:02.566
I heard we weren't
getting them again.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.005
Yeah, it's not a
company-wide bonus, though.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.407
It's only on the partner level.
It's for retention.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.481
Not for us.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.846
The checks are being
cut to the people

08:08.920 --> 08:10.160
on that list,
who are all partners,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.925
but the retention program is to
keep the entire company healthy.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.891
But there's
no money going to...

08:14.960 --> 08:18.089
We survived a terrible,
terrible moment in our history,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.766
and we retained
60% of the workforce.

08:20.840 --> 08:21.841
Lost 40, though.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.160
Those are pretty
impressive numbers,

08:23.240 --> 08:25.720
so I think everybody
should be happy about this.

08:25.800 --> 08:26.926
Well, this is great news.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.680
I don't understand the tone of your voice.
You're acting like it's a...

08:29.840 --> 08:31.171
No, I was just so excited

08:31.280 --> 08:32.566
because we haven't had the
bonuses for three years.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.688
The company's doing well, I
thought maybe this was the day.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.600
Okay. Just because Harry
Cornish gets a bonus

08:36.640 --> 08:38.289
doesn't necessarily
mean that Peterson...

08:38.360 --> 08:39.640
What's your
first name, Peterson?

08:39.880 --> 08:41.644
It's Sandy Patterson.

08:41.799 --> 08:42.881
Was that rough?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.651
The first name is...
No, it's Sandy Koufax.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.051
Oh, right.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.850
My dad was a big ball fan.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.849
Let me go cut these checks.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.001
You watch baseball?

08:53.080 --> 08:54.760
It just sounded funny,
the way you said it.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.720
I'll leave that one alone,
it's your dad.

08:57.960 --> 08:58.961
Oh, yeah. No.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.042
Seriously, though, what is
it exactly that you do?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.600
I manage the
in-house accounts, sir.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.563
So, essentially,
you do what the program

09:04.640 --> 09:06.529
that my wife uses,
called Quicken, does.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.291
Well...
You put numbers in boxes.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.050
You could train a baboon
to do it, if you had to.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.646
The fact of the matter is,
the economy is changing.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.960
People like me are important.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.480
We bring the money in and pay
people like you with it.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.721
You understand?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.525
You know what? I'm gonna get you
a copy of The Fountainhead.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.331
You're gonna read it, you're gonna
understand why this is good for everybody.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.323
All right. Let's do it today,
because I gotta get on the plane,

09:24.400 --> 09:25.401
'cause I gotta go to Tahiti.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.641
You're gonna go
to Tahiti today?

09:26.720 --> 09:29.041
Yeah, I'm going today. Not
private, either. Commercial.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.446
Sure. We all have
to take a haircut.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.323
Private would be excessive.
Not you. All right.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.561
Man.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.281
Sandy Patterson.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.250
<i>Hello, Sandy, I'm Jeanette
from Lady's Choice Salon.</i>

10:13.400 --> 10:16.131
<i>I'm calling to confirm your
appointment for this Friday at 3:00.</i>

10:16.440 --> 10:17.801
Sorry, you've got
the wrong number.

10:18.040 --> 10:21.203
<i>Oh, is this
Sandy Bigelow Patterson?</i>

10:21.360 --> 10:23.044
Yeah. But...

10:24.760 --> 10:26.603
"407." Where is that?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.444
<i>Winter Park, Florida.</i>

10:28.600 --> 10:31.490
Okay. You've got Denver, here.
How did you dial this number?

10:31.640 --> 10:35.122
<i>Well, you didn't leave one when you made
the appointment, so we googled you.</i>

10:35.200 --> 10:36.725
I see. Well,
you've got the wrong...

10:36.800 --> 10:37.801
Sorry, buddy.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.724
Can you meet me in the parking garage?
Level 7B.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.802
Sure.
Thanks.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.121
Hey. He's here.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.280
What's this? What's going on?
Is everything all right?

10:57.320 --> 10:58.401
You like getting fucked?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.842
Because that is what's
happening upstairs.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.401
Aren't you sick of
getting fucked by Cornish?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.841
Yeah, I'm a little sore.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.527
We don't like it either.
That's why we're leaving.

11:12.080 --> 11:15.880
We're starting our own firm.
We're taking all our clients.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.567
Come with us.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.846
Come with you?

11:18.920 --> 11:21.491
Sandy, you're the best
at what you do.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.530
You'd be a VP. You'll
have your own office.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.284
What are you making right now?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.801
I make 50.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.286
How about 250?

11:35.240 --> 11:36.241
When are you doing this?

11:36.440 --> 11:37.441
Now.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.161
Now. Today, now?

11:40.360 --> 11:41.361
Come on.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.809
Could I have everybody's
attention please?

11:48.720 --> 11:51.644
The six of us are leaving
to start a new company.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.361
You now have our new
contact information.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.401
If you think of yourself as a
cog, we're not interested.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.720
But if you want to be a
part of building something,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.724
if you want to be a part of
changing this awful business,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.370
stand up now and join us.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.165
That's wonderful, everybody.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.886
Isn't that inspiring?

12:10.560 --> 12:11.561
A start-up.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.045
Please, I invite you, anybody
who wants to join this fellow,

12:15.800 --> 12:17.040
I'm considering it myself.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.004
But if you do join these traitors,
you will live to regret it.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.251
Because this firm has offices in
20 cities in three continents,

12:25.320 --> 12:27.641
and you do not
want us as an enemy.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.285
Last chance.
Who's with us?

12:37.280 --> 12:38.964
I am.
Who said that?

12:39.880 --> 12:40.881
I did.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.730
Sandy. Anybody else
want to join him?

12:44.800 --> 12:46.080
All he's got
are threats, people.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.447
And all they have is Sandy.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.603
You better pray this works. You
better pray this works, Sandy.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.728
You better pray this works,
because I'm coming for you.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.690
And I'm killing you everywhere.
Don't come crawling back!

13:10.040 --> 13:11.280
What?

13:27.720 --> 13:30.451
Oh! Boy, that's nice.

13:30.600 --> 13:34.650
That looks good, that looks good.
I lost my wedding ring. Shh!

13:35.200 --> 13:37.407
Fifteen years of marriage.
Can you believe that?

13:37.840 --> 13:40.081
May I see your ID?
Mmm-hmm.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.241
Yes, you can.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.401
Sandy Bigelow Patterson.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.327
We just got married
back in St. Paul.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.244
Yeah. Howard's a surgeon.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.050
So, he fixes smiles.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.411
Yeah, he's kind of
the big guy for teeth.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.129
My friends took me out
for my birthday.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.971
They made a big deal
out of me turning 30.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.522
I was like,
"Thirty, what? No way."

14:10.640 --> 14:13.325
I mean, I hit it pretty hard
in my twenties, so...

14:13.480 --> 14:15.528
Do you like to hit it hard?

14:15.680 --> 14:17.808
I bet you do.
I bet you can hit that

14:18.560 --> 14:19.561
so hard.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.964
There we go, okay.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.360
Let's get them off it.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.928
Ma'am? Ma'am.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.881
What the fuck?

14:40.640 --> 14:42.768
Ma'am, your card was declined.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.650
Oh, yeah.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.441
Here, use this one.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.081
That one's done.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.801
Great.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.927
Hi. Good morning.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.685
Something wrong with pump five.
It's not taking my card.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.600
Thanks.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.210
You don't pay your bills, man.
I gotta cut the card.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.322
"Cut the card."
No, I absolutely pay my bills.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.970
Run it one more time. Nothing
wrong with that card.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.201
That's not what
it says right here.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.771
I don't care what the screen says.
Maybe it's broken.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.684
I'll go somewhere else.
You're not cutting that card.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.330
Cutting the card?
That's ridiculous.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.209
Tell you what,
I'll go somewhere else.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.407
You go somewhere else?

15:58.480 --> 16:01.165
Look, that's my <i>papi.</i>
He owns this store.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.685
He says cut the card.
<i>Señor.</i>

16:02.840 --> 16:04.842
If you don't pay your bills...
My bills are paid.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.604
Oh, your bills are paid.
I gotta cut the card.

16:06.760 --> 16:07.886
Do not cut that card.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.082
I'm gonna cut the card.
I just cut the card.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.922
Go pay your bills, Randy.
It's Sandy.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.081
Sandy?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.522
How's my credit exceeded?

16:21.680 --> 16:26.720
<i>Well, Mr. Patterson,
your balance is $12,243.67.</i>

16:26.920 --> 16:31.687
That's absurd. I use the
card for gas and for coffee.

16:31.880 --> 16:36.044
<i>I'm showing $4,345 from
Great Beyond Water Sports.</i>

16:36.200 --> 16:38.407
Well, I'll stop you there, because
I've never heard of that place.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.968
"Great Beyond Water Sports"?
Nope, I've never been there.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.282
And that was this morning?
I just left the house.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.642
Except for the gas station
that I went to,

16:46.720 --> 16:48.882
where my card
got chopped in half

16:49.040 --> 16:51.725
by an angry man in
a glass box, okay?

16:51.880 --> 16:55.043
So, first things first, I need
a fresh card in the mail.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.244
And Loretta, I need you on
the stick to unscrew me.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.324
This is clearly on your end.
This is not me.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.403
Or I'll fix it.
Where's the surf shop?

17:03.560 --> 17:05.561
<i>Well, sir, it's in
Winter Park, Florida.</i>

17:05.720 --> 17:09.611
Florida? I'm in Colorado,
you know, so...

17:12.839 --> 17:14.410
- Damn it.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

17:14.560 --> 17:16.528
Unbelievable. I gotta call you back.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.761
<i>Driver.</i>
Sorry!

17:17.839 --> 17:20.080
<i>Pull the vehicle to
the side of the road.</i>

17:21.960 --> 17:25.646
<i>NCIC
says 10-29F, use caution.</i>

17:32.680 --> 17:34.444
Step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Patterson.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.090
Okay, coming out of the
vehicle for hands-free?

17:38.280 --> 17:40.123
That seems just
a little bit excessive.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.247
Mr. Patterson,
you're under arrest.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.321
Under arrest?

17:42.480 --> 17:43.527
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.647
Hey, wait a second.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.168
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.604
The arresting officer ran
your license through the NCIC.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.445
You were booked for felony assault
two weeks ago in Florida.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.126
What? No, I wasn't.
What are you talking about?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.248
I've never even been to Florida.
You've never been to Florida?

17:59.320 --> 18:01.687
No, sir. This whole morning...

18:02.280 --> 18:05.284
Well, hang on a second.
Was it Winter Park, Florida?

18:05.360 --> 18:06.361
See, that's good.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.130
We're dropping the whole
"there's been a mistake" thing.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.691
I got it now. Listen...

18:09.840 --> 18:11.251
The problem is,
Mr. Patterson,

18:11.360 --> 18:14.045
is that you missed your court
date three days ago in Florida.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.280
Officer, let me just explain.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.403
And the judge has issued a
warrant for your arrest.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.161
Yeah...
So what we're gonna do

18:20.320 --> 18:21.970
is we're gonna go ahead and
ship you back down to Florida.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.121
You can work on your tan.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.247
Sir. Yeah, listen.
You're not listening.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.367
Sit down.
Sorry.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.045
There's a person
that has my same name

18:27.120 --> 18:28.565
that is doing
things in Florida.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.645
This guy is making salon appointments,
he's buying beach equipment.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.410
He's maxing out my credit card.

18:34.560 --> 18:38.451
Are you Sandy Bigelow
Patterson, born May 18th, 1974?

18:38.520 --> 18:39.567
That is you, correct?

18:39.680 --> 18:41.205
Yeah, but it's not
me doing this stuff.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.681
I've never even been to the state.
I'm here with you guys.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.081
I'm in Colorado.
How can I be in Florida?

18:48.080 --> 18:50.560
Call Winter Park PD.
Pull the mug shot.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.444
Okay, uncuff him.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.285
Uncuff me. That's great.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.044
Can I see?

19:01.560 --> 19:02.561
Whoa.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.201
Is that a woman?

19:04.400 --> 19:07.051
If I had to guess, it's the
woman that stole your identity,

19:07.200 --> 19:10.124
obviously taking advantage of the
fact that you have a female name.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.009
Oh, it's not female,
it's unisex.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.880
When you say "stole my identity,"
do you mean credit card fraud?

19:14.920 --> 19:16.126
Oh, no, no, it's a lot
worse than that.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.565
See, what happens is,
they get a hold of

19:17.640 --> 19:18.971
your name, your birthday,
Social Security.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.724
And then they run up debt,

19:20.880 --> 19:22.370
get arrested,
commit crimes as you.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.010
What do you do now? You
go down, you go get her?

19:24.200 --> 19:27.249
Oh, no, we don't go get anyone.
Let me walk you out.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.722
See, we're Denver PD. All we
do is open and close the case.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.723
Now, if she buys
something on Amazon,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.609
then Seattle PD
would investigate.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.604
Your mobile company's in Ohio,
then Cleveland PD handles that.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.444
Then so on and so forth
for every single theft.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.682
Well, hang on. How long
does all this take?

19:41.840 --> 19:43.649
About six months to a year.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.721
A Year?

19:44.880 --> 19:45.961
Yeah. So why don't
you go ahead

19:46.080 --> 19:48.082
and just leave your contact
information with this gentleman here?

19:48.160 --> 19:50.288
You might want to hold on to this
mug shot in case you may need it.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.327
Great. Okay.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.970
Listen, I'm gonna
need this solved

19:53.040 --> 19:54.485
a whole lot quicker
than a year, Detective.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.201
Okay, listen, I understand that
this is really frustrating for you,

19:57.240 --> 19:59.527
but our percentage rate in solving
these cases is pretty high.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.647
Yeah? How many?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.000
About 5 to 10 percent.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.167
That's garbage.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.402
We'll be in touch
with you, Sandy.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.120
Hi, I'm Sandy...
Mr. Patterson.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.164
I know who you are.
I'm Jessica. Hi.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.287
Welcome.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.610
Anything you need, just ask.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.091
Your office
is right over there.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.323
Office. Nice to meet you.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.491
Patterson?
Sorry.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.411
I had a hell of a morning.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.527
Listen to this.
Can you explain this to me?

20:47.640 --> 20:48.641
What do you got?

20:48.880 --> 20:51.804
These are emails I received from
a couple of prospective clients.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.961
No, no, no.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.804
You defaulted on
six credit cards?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.882
No, I didn't, actually.
You did.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.081
No. You have nine
other delinquencies.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.400
This is what my morning's
been all about.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.847
Your credit score's a 240.
A 240!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.685
There are homeless people with
better numbers than that, Sandy.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.888
Dude, you have a warrant
out for your arrest.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.530
This is
a financial institution.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.729
How am I supposed to give you
access to $5 billion in funds?

21:11.880 --> 21:13.245
My identity's been stolen.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.121
I was at the police
station all morning.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.481
Don't worry about it, though.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.971
I'm gonna get on the phone,
I'm going to clean it up.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.247
They can run my credit tomorrow
and it's gonna be fine, okay?

21:20.400 --> 21:21.526
What the fuck is this?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.365
Those are cops!
That's my guy.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.363
This is the detective
that's handling my case.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.649
Hi. I was just filling my
boss in on our situation.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.884
Did you find her? Do you
have some good news?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.042
No, I'm sorry, we don't
have any good news.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.646
Soon after you left, we got
a call from Orlando Metro.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.851
They just busted a narcotics
dealer named Paolo Gordon.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.685
Your name and your credit
cards turned up in connection

21:42.760 --> 21:44.091
with the investigation.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.446
Ah! This...

21:46.080 --> 21:49.801
One of my colleagues spoke to your
former employer, Mr. Harold Cornish.

21:49.880 --> 21:50.847
Yeah.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.366
And he said that, in fact,
you are a drug dealer.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.651
That's...
He's a fucking liar.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.451
I've got a warrant
to search the premises.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.204
For drugs.
Oh.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.485
And guns.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.040
This is a waste of time.
I understand.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.646
It's not me, it's the
woman in the picture.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.365
Just doing my job.
I need to put that out.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.010
Okay.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.083
Okay, guys, let's...

22:18.800 --> 22:21.280
Okay, we're done.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.005
You can let your
employees back in now.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.121
Thank you.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.123
So, no Oxy?
No, no Oxy.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.327
Did you find my weapons?

22:27.760 --> 22:29.683
I'm not an idiot,
Mr. Patterson, okay?

22:29.760 --> 22:31.524
I know almost certainly
it's the woman in Florida.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.721
Yeah.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.848
But until we know for sure
that you didn't do this,

22:34.920 --> 22:36.126
it's an open investigation.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.611
For narcotics.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.441
Let me walk you out.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.320
We're gonna have to
talk about our options.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.609
I think we got to let you go.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.444
I know where she is. Hey!

23:04.640 --> 23:07.564
I know exactly where she's
gonna be tomorrow afternoon.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.722
If I tell you, you can tell the
Winter Park Police Department,

23:09.800 --> 23:11.962
they can grab her,
and we're done.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.162
No, no, it doesn't work like that.
Why not?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.561
Well, they'd have to bring her
up on local charges first.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.807
And it would pretty much be about a
year before we get a shot at her.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.043
I mean, she'd have to be standing
right here to do you any good.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.129
That's the new
standard of police work?

23:24.200 --> 23:26.407
I mean, the criminal's got to be
standing right in front of you?

23:26.480 --> 23:28.244
Have a good day.
Hang on, hang on.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.482
If they won't bring her here,
what if I bring her here?

23:30.640 --> 23:31.766
What if, somehow,
I get her here,

23:31.840 --> 23:32.887
and I put her right
in front of you,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.241
she gives you a full statement
and owns up to everything?

23:35.360 --> 23:37.010
Then we'd be done, wouldn't we?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.685
Oh, I wouldn't recommend that,
Mr. Patterson.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.410
You see, criminals
generally just don't

23:40.520 --> 23:42.010
volunteer confessions
to policemen.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.447
All right, what about this?

23:44.600 --> 23:46.841
What about if I ask
her to talk to you?

23:47.160 --> 23:50.004
Because she cost me my job
and I want to get my job back,

23:50.160 --> 23:52.766
and in return,
I don't press any charges.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.366
She doesn't have to worry about me.
There's no cops.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.601
But there are cops.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.808
You're down the hall, you're
listening to a thing. I'm wearing...

23:58.880 --> 24:00.405
What?
That's ridiculous.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.080
No, no, no, this sort of thing
tends to work pretty well. Right?

24:03.240 --> 24:04.605
And we do have enough
for an eavesdrop warrant.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.160
No, no. Sandy, I need somebody
here doing the work right now.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.368
I'm the best at what I do.
Those are your words.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.760
I'm just looking for
a little bit of time.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.321
We don't have time. I'm supposed
to put everything on hold?

24:13.400 --> 24:14.401
We have clients!

24:14.480 --> 24:16.847
Listen, I gave up everything because I
believe in you. Just believe in me.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.605
Come on, you know me.
Come on, Daniel.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.169
I'll give you one week.
Really?

24:25.240 --> 24:26.241
But that's it.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.721
That's all I need. Thank you.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.961
One week, Patterson!

24:31.120 --> 24:33.566
I'm calling to confirm my wife's
appointment for tomorrow at 3:00.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.802
Thank you. She ended up
making the appointment.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.725
I didn't realize that she's
gonna be in the area.

24:38.880 --> 24:42.487
Anyway, I need your address
because she lost it.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.722
Okay. Got it. Thank you.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.922
She'll see you tomorrow
at 3:00. Bye-bye.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.766
Okay. I've got cash for the plane
ticket, I've got my sock money.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.763
Did you call the cab?
Don't do this.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.764
Don't start this again. Trish, I
need you to just hang in there.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.445
This is not who we are.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.005
You're not Batman.
Do not unpack this.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.764
Please, I can't
refold all this stuff.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.649
Do you even know
how to use those?

25:03.800 --> 25:05.802
It's just in case.
It is my only option.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.009
It is our only option.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.920
Let me see the picture
of her again.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.926
Make you feel
better to see that?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.001
Uh-huh.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.441
Yeah. She's not dangerous.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.690
That number right
there is her height.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.042
It's hobbit height.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.291
I'm going after Bilbo.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.402
Yeah, I can do this,
I really can.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.289
But I can't do it
without your support.

25:35.120 --> 25:37.282
Okay? Please trust me.

25:38.520 --> 25:39.521
Thank you.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.644
If all goes well, I'll be right
back here tomorrow night.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.041
Also, I borrowed
your anxiety pills

25:45.120 --> 25:46.645
because I might have to
coax her onto the airplane.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.290
Oh, good.
Okay, that's fine

25:48.400 --> 25:49.961
'cause why would I
need those right now?

25:50.800 --> 25:53.007
I'll call you
when I land, okay?

25:53.120 --> 25:54.201
Goodbye, you guys.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.322
Daddy, the TV's broken.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.688
Oh. Well, you know.
Come here.

25:59.840 --> 26:03.322
Some things are broken,
but only for a few days.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.880
That's why I have
to go on this trip

26:04.920 --> 26:06.365
to pretty much the worst
place in America.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.204
But Daddy's gonna
fix these problems.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.488
When I get back,
it's all gonna be perfect.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.847
I promise, okay? Come here.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.843
It's too late for TV anyway,
you guys are going to bed.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.686
Do some drawing,
and then PJs. Goodbye.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.480
Go get this bitch.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.246
Roger.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.006
Ooh!

27:18.920 --> 27:19.967
Okay.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.201
Okay.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.086
My neck.
Oh, man, I taste blood.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.085
Oh, jeez.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.366
You got an injury.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.562
Oh, my neck. My neck got it.
Sorry about that.

27:51.720 --> 27:53.529
I didn't assume you were
gonna come to a full stop

27:53.600 --> 27:54.721
in the middle of the highway.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.764
Oh, a mama badger and a
baby crossing the road.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.886
A badger, huh?

28:00.040 --> 28:01.371
Yeah. Oh, my God.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.161
My fibromyalgia's just
shooting down my spine.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.004
Jeez Louise.

28:07.960 --> 28:11.248
No, this is totally my fault.
You got your license on you?

28:11.400 --> 28:12.845
Why don't we swap information?

28:12.960 --> 28:14.769
We can get the insurance
companies involved.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.246
I guess that's
what it comes to.

28:18.400 --> 28:22.121
I hate to tell you, but that's
a custom paint job. Thank you.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.967
You know,
if it's okay with you,

28:26.120 --> 28:29.647
I'm okay and I'm cool
with just doing cash.

28:29.800 --> 28:34.522
Yeah, cash would be a lot easier,
wouldn't it, Sandy Bigelow Patterson?

28:34.600 --> 28:35.567
Yeah.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.165
Bigelow is such a rare name.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.163
Well, it's a family name,
you know.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.130
It goes back to the Mayflower.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.401
Is that right?

28:42.480 --> 28:43.891
Yeah. Jeremiah Bigelow.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.283
Maybe you've heard of him.
Pretty prominent bear hunter.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.090
Sounds brave.
Kind of a big deal.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.722
Here's my license
with my name right there.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.645
Sandy Bigelow Patterson.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.601
Gotcha.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.282
Ow! Not my hair, you fuck!

29:08.840 --> 29:10.444
You're not going anywhere.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.051
Get out of the car!

29:12.320 --> 29:14.322
Ow! Keep it!

29:16.560 --> 29:18.005
Took the lift out of the crown!

29:19.280 --> 29:21.408
I fucking just had it done!

29:34.400 --> 29:35.890
No, no, no!

29:37.320 --> 29:38.481
What, are you crazy?

29:40.120 --> 29:41.565
What are you doing?

29:41.720 --> 29:44.120
You're looking for these? You're
not gonna find them, stupid.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.164
See you, Sandy!

29:55.080 --> 29:56.684
Oh, come on.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.607
Hi.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.887
<i>Hey, it's me.
Is this a bad time?</i>

30:01.960 --> 30:04.008
No, great time.
What's going on, honey?

30:04.080 --> 30:07.289
<i>We just got a call from a debt
collector from Fiat Automotive.</i>

30:07.400 --> 30:09.402
<i>They said we're behind
on some payments.</i>

30:09.600 --> 30:13.366
A call from a...
From a debt collector, huh?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.329
<i>I guess she
bought herself a car.</i>

30:15.480 --> 30:17.482
Well, honey, that is just...

30:18.400 --> 30:20.528
You sound really weird.
Are you sure you're okay?

30:22.080 --> 30:23.525
Yeah, I'm good.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.370
Okay.

30:34.480 --> 30:39.850
Let's see what kind of crap you
have in your bag, Sandy Patterson.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.930
Here you go. Thanks.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.968
Ooh! Nice.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.930
Ding-dong!
Shit.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.320
Put it down.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.928
Now, we're gonna have a little chat.
Okay.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.641
Okay? We can do it the hard way,
or we can do it the easy way.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.050
I'd like to pick the easy way.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.840
Get over here and
give me your wrists.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.649
Okay.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.480
Now, I have a plan...

31:39.320 --> 31:41.402
Shit! I'm a lady,
you fucking animal.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.244
Give me your wrist.
Stop fighting me.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.891
Yeah, I'll fight it. You like that?
You like that?

31:46.040 --> 31:48.008
How about that?
You like hitting girls?

31:48.160 --> 31:49.650
Sandy? This isn't cute, Sandy!

31:49.760 --> 31:50.807
Stay down!

31:52.120 --> 31:53.326
Oh, shit!

31:54.120 --> 31:55.167
Shit.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.126
Shit, shit. Ow!

31:59.160 --> 32:00.207
Ha!

32:00.840 --> 32:01.887
Stay down.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.724
You threw like a fucking girl.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.809
Now, once you hear my plan,
you're gonna wanna come with me.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.724
I'm not going
anywhere with you!

32:07.880 --> 32:09.450
Fuck you, Sandy. Damn it. Stop
right there and listen to me.

32:09.520 --> 32:13.286
No, go home to your shitty wife
and your fucking dumb-ass kids.

32:13.360 --> 32:14.407
Stop right there!

32:16.840 --> 32:18.205
Why did you do that?

32:18.360 --> 32:19.441
You did that.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.920
Well, that was not
the easy way.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.526
I loved that guitar.
I'm gonna sue you.

32:25.680 --> 32:26.920
You're gonna sue me?

32:27.080 --> 32:29.970
Really, you're gonna sue me?
Enjoy the empty accounts.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.610
I'll be taking my car keys.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.604
And what are these?

32:33.720 --> 32:34.721
These are future victims?

32:34.880 --> 32:36.086
Put my shit down.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.241
They can thank me later.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.049
Is that how you buy all this crap?
What do you need this for?

32:40.120 --> 32:41.121
You're sick.

32:41.200 --> 32:46.331
This stuff is things I use for my
charity that I help children with.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.487
For the what?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.244
For my children's charity,
you dick.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.681
Oh, that makes sense.
I apologize.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.450
Now, you're coming with me.
Give me your wrist.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.045
What's your name, by the way?

32:54.240 --> 32:56.004
Julia.
Julia?

32:56.240 --> 32:59.369
Diana!
Open the fucking door!

32:59.640 --> 33:01.404
Shit!

33:01.520 --> 33:02.567
Who's that?

33:02.720 --> 33:05.166
Just changing my clothes.
I'll be right out!

33:05.320 --> 33:09.006
Don't lie to me. Those credit
cards you sold Paolo were shit.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.889
No, no, no,
it's a misunderstanding.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.884
It will be so funny when I
explain it to you guys.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.610
You're coming with us, now!

33:15.840 --> 33:16.887
Just give me the car keys.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.450
No, you're not
taking the car again.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.246
Shit!

33:32.160 --> 33:34.162
Go, go, go!

33:39.520 --> 33:41.249
What? What the...

33:41.400 --> 33:42.447
You little bitch.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.204
You just make friends
wherever you go, huh?

33:49.360 --> 33:51.283
Who were those people?
Don't worry about it.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.043
And what the hell is that?
Is that a bobby pin?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.361
Yep, sure as shit is.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.806
You're wasting your time.
That's not coming off.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.121
Yeah, we'll see about that.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.930
How about you just apologize
for getting me shot at?

34:00.080 --> 34:01.161
I'm not gonna
apologize for that

34:01.320 --> 34:05.291
because you should not
have broken into my home.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.960
So, it's a little
lesson for you, Sandy.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.531
Pull over.
I'm not pulling over.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.205
We're going to an airport

34:11.280 --> 34:13.567
and we're taking the first
flight to Denver, Diana.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.007
Why don't you pull over
before I kick your ass again?

34:16.159 --> 34:17.571
As soon as I explain it, you're
gonna come with me. All right?

34:17.719 --> 34:20.600
I'll tell you what, why don't we find
a bar, we calm down a little bit...

34:20.719 --> 34:23.087
I buy you a drink, I talk, you listen?
Does that sound fair?

34:23.239 --> 34:25.049
That sounds fair, Sandy.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.565
You'll behave yourself
if we find a bar?

34:26.719 --> 34:28.005
Oh, totally.
Great.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.161
Yeah, I'll behave myself

34:29.239 --> 34:31.083
because you will
have probably dosed me

34:31.159 --> 34:32.969
with a shitload of
Trish Patterson's Xanax.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.246
Hey, when did you get those?

34:34.400 --> 34:36.562
I had two hands down your
pants, and you didn't notice,

34:36.639 --> 34:38.563
so you should deal with that.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.045
Fucking dead below the waist.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.167
You're disgusting.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.771
Just pull the car over.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.880
Is that what you want?
Yes.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.411
Jesus Christ, yes.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.922
Here you go. You're sure? Right
in the middle of the highway.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.047
Yeah, right in the middle
of the highway.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.167
Really?

34:52.080 --> 34:55.322
All right. I'll tell you what, then.
I'll just call the police

34:55.400 --> 34:57.050
and I'll tell them that
there's a criminal

34:57.120 --> 34:58.724
out here with a known warrant

34:58.800 --> 35:00.325
just hanging around
the highway.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.244
I got a lot of evidence
they'd like to see.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.651
You got nothing.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.369
Hey! I'm calling
the police right now.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.602
Good luck, pal.
I'll be long gone.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.489
It's ringing.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.010
What are you, a fucking Kenyan?

35:18.800 --> 35:21.371
Listen, I just need
you to talk to my boss.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.885
That's it. And I won't
press charges, okay?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.451
I'm losing my job
because of you.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.646
Your job?
That's right.

35:25.720 --> 35:26.881
I didn't fire you.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.883
Effectively, you did.
I don't think I did.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.400
And I don't wanna go to Colorado
and meet your anxious wife.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.965
You're right, she is anxious.
She's very anxious.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.167
You wanna know why?

35:34.360 --> 35:36.647
Because we have two daughters
and a third on the way.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.040
We live in a very,
very small apartment,

35:38.240 --> 35:40.481
about half the size of that
house I bet you stole.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.961
Hey, I worked hard
for that house.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.489
I'm proud of it. I have a
seven-year amorticized sub-rate...

35:46.560 --> 35:47.561
It's amortized.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.723
Well, I can't get into that.
You're not gonna get it.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.847
Enough, all right?

35:51.960 --> 35:55.328
This is a free trip, okay?
It's on me, all right?

35:55.400 --> 35:56.606
No cops.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.364
All you need to do is talk
to my boss, that's it.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.887
And then we're done. That's all.
It's very simple.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.326
Come on, it's in Denver.
You're gonna love it.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.686
There's nobody
shooting at you there.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.240
You stay here,
they're gonna find you.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.406
Hey, hey, hey!

36:11.360 --> 36:12.885
Come on.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.849
This is ridiculous.

36:16.920 --> 36:17.921
Shit.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.001
You blow a tire?

36:20.080 --> 36:21.605
Yeah, I blew a fucking tire.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.121
Why don't you
rest that in the car?

36:23.720 --> 36:25.131
Put the air on.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.245
I won't talk to the cops.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.289
Right, no cops.
I said that.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.401
And don't lie to me.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.249
I'm not.
I'm not lying, I swear.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.845
Yeah? You swear
on your kids?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.284
Yeah, swear on your kids.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.046
Yes, I swear on my kids.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.045
Shotgun.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.326
I'll need the keys.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.561
Here you go.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.404
Thank you.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.448
- Yeah?
<i>- Did you get her?</i>

37:05.520 --> 37:06.521
Almost.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.647
<i>Almost?</i>

37:07.800 --> 37:11.646
Okay, then I almost won't kill
you when I get out of here.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.327
She's a nobody who sells
credit cards she already used.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.720
We'll get the money back.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.445
<i>It is beyond that, Marisol.</i>

37:18.600 --> 37:22.605
Now, this nobody of yours is
causing me a big problem.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.842
<i>She's become a liability.</i>

37:25.000 --> 37:27.082
One of her cards
tipped off the cops.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.486
She gotta go. You get
Julian and you get it done.

37:32.320 --> 37:35.005
Okay, but she's with some guy.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.448
You kill her, you kill him,
you kill anyone you need to.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.961
Okay.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.849
Speed this
shit up, we gotta go.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.683
- I don't work for you.
- Oh, yes, you do.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.485
Hank!

37:47.600 --> 37:48.965
You got it, Paolo.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.887
So, I was wondering,

37:53.080 --> 37:55.606
how is it that we're
getting on that plane?

37:56.120 --> 37:59.408
I already have my ticket,
and I brought cash for yours.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.325
Are we both going to show our
Sandy Bigelow Patterson,

38:02.480 --> 38:04.801
same birthday, everything,
at the same time?

38:04.880 --> 38:08.009
Let the airline just have a
field day with that, or...

38:08.360 --> 38:09.646
Yeah, that's what I thought.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.171
Son of a bitch!

38:15.960 --> 38:17.564
Well, we're driving now.
We're driving, then.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.085
Okay.

38:20.640 --> 38:23.041
Oh! I can't believe
I missed that.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.569
You've gotta feel so dumb.

38:26.720 --> 38:28.290
Please don't.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.168
Think we just need
a little music.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.691
Dude, I can hit this.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.484
Hello? Yeah?
What do you got?

39:24.640 --> 39:26.961
<i>Got a runner.
Pays 50 K.</i>

39:27.120 --> 39:28.724
50 K?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

39:28.960 --> 39:30.041
You got a name?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.521
<i>Sandy Patterson. She
skipped a few court dates.</i>

39:32.720 --> 39:33.767
Any leads?

39:33.840 --> 39:35.126
<i>Yeah, she just
swiped a credit card</i>

39:35.200 --> 39:37.646
<i>at a place near you
called Lady's Choice.</i>

39:50.240 --> 39:51.651
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
We're closed.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.644
Do you know a Sandy Patterson?
A customer?

39:54.800 --> 39:57.644
Used a credit card here
earlier today around 4:00?

39:57.800 --> 39:59.040
You her boyfriend or something?

39:59.160 --> 40:00.161
Oh, no, no.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.649
No. I'm a skiptracer.
A collector.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.843
Like a bounty hunter.

40:07.000 --> 40:11.005
I find people that owe money and I
bring them back to where they belong.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.083
Oh, this Sandy, she owe a lot?

40:13.240 --> 40:15.925
Yeah, well, they don't
send me for a little.

40:16.320 --> 40:20.006
No, she jumped bail and I've
been hired to bring her back.

40:20.680 --> 40:21.966
I would like to help you out,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.521
but I ain't supposed to share
client information, so...

40:24.680 --> 40:26.967
Of course, I understand.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.806
This is a nice place.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.927
Yeah.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.329
I hear this stuff's
pretty flammable.

40:46.880 --> 40:50.089
Be a shame if your place of
employment burned to shit.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.721
You want to show me where
that appointment book is?

40:54.920 --> 40:55.921
There you go.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.406
Oh, jeez.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.489
I really do
appreciate your help.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.721
Go on. Take it.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.246
Now, how about a smile?

41:36.320 --> 41:38.243
Look at you light up a room.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.120
I'm gonna have a hard time
forgetting that face.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.407
You go on and forget
about this one.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.362
Yeah, not what I was planning,

41:55.520 --> 41:58.490
but I will be home on Sunday
or Monday by the latest.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.201
It is what it is, I guess.
How are the girls?

42:02.560 --> 42:04.210
Okay. I love you, too.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.966
I'll call you later. Bye.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.931
How long have you
guys been together?

42:13.160 --> 42:14.605
I'm not going to
talk about myself.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.600
Or my family. You're never going
to know anything about me.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.644
There's nothing wrong
with being a simple guy.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.006
I'm just a simple gal.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.169
From Wisconsin. You know?
I'm a cheesehead.

42:27.320 --> 42:28.367
Fascinating.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.481
I'm from Morganville.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.211
It's a little, tiny town,
but charming.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.447
I don't care.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.887
Mom's 70. Still working.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.611
Dad retired about, I guess, two and a...

42:38.760 --> 42:40.888
I want to say two and a half years.
Two, two and a half...

42:41.040 --> 42:42.929
Jesus Christ.
Two and a half years ago.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.122
He was a principal
at a middle school.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.361
They sound so normal.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.522
How'd they have a criminal
asshole for a daughter

42:48.600 --> 42:50.045
who just goes around
wrecking people's lives?

42:50.120 --> 42:51.246
How'd that work out?

42:51.320 --> 42:56.087
I think you're painting it with
the most negative brush possible.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.605
I bet that they would paint
it the same exact way.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.001
I mean, what you do is...
I use the system.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.245
I use the system that's provided...
You cheat the system.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.288
Now, the fact that I... No,
I do not cheat the system.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.482
I use the system.
If there's a loophole,

43:09.560 --> 43:10.891
and I go through the loophole,

43:11.000 --> 43:12.525
I'm not doing anything wrong.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.563
You create a lot
of destruction.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.530
You know, it's not my fault if people
don't check their own finances.

43:17.880 --> 43:20.486
All you do is make one call
to the credit card company,

43:20.920 --> 43:22.763
they take the charge off.
It's a victimless crime...

43:22.840 --> 43:23.841
You don't take any
accountability for this?

43:23.920 --> 43:25.843
It's not a victimless...
I'm a victim!

43:26.240 --> 43:29.369
We're kind of in the midst of a
pivotal moment here, you know?

43:29.560 --> 43:30.561
This is...

43:31.360 --> 43:33.966
I think we might want
to take stock of this.

43:34.040 --> 43:37.203
We're kind of bonding.

43:37.920 --> 43:40.730
It's kind of like family,
or brother and sister,

43:42.240 --> 43:44.004
if brother and sister were

43:45.000 --> 43:46.923
pretty attracted to each other.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.209
We are just driving to Denver.
There will be nothing else.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.324
I just thought,

43:52.440 --> 43:54.568
in the spirit of honesty,
I'd put out there

43:54.720 --> 43:56.131
that I visually enjoy you.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.726
Hmm.

43:57.960 --> 44:02.682
And I've always, you know,
really liked tall men.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.963
What are you talking...
I'm average height.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.320
Not to me, stretch.

44:09.440 --> 44:10.441
Great.

44:10.760 --> 44:13.127
Look at that.
See that? "Adventure."

44:13.280 --> 44:14.964
I love that.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.201
When are we going to pull over?

44:16.280 --> 44:17.327
We're not.

44:17.560 --> 44:21.326
You know, they say driving tired is
more dangerous than driving drunk

44:21.480 --> 44:23.960
and that's a statistical fact.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.167
I doubt it.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.087
You know,
I drive drunk all the time.

44:29.520 --> 44:32.967
Never had a problem. I slept-drove
once and I smashed into an Arby's.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.201
Take a nap.

44:34.440 --> 44:38.081
All right. Whatever you say.
Going down. Thank you.

44:40.080 --> 44:41.047
Uh-oh.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.121
What happened?

44:42.400 --> 44:43.970
You look taller from down here.

44:48.360 --> 44:49.805
Welcome to the Colonnade.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.166
How y'all doing?

44:51.320 --> 44:53.368
Good.
We're famished, though.

44:53.520 --> 44:55.807
We just drove all
the way from Gibson, so.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.966
You know what, do you think we can
maybe have a booth instead of a table?

45:01.040 --> 45:04.408
It's just it's real hard for Walt
there to sit on a hard chair,

45:04.480 --> 45:06.642
'cause of his accident
and he, uh...

45:09.800 --> 45:11.161
You know what I mean?
He doesn't...

45:13.520 --> 45:15.249
Just right at the base.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.568
Okay?
Okay. Yeah.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.121
Come on.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.924
Oh! This is nice.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.723
It's nice and soft, Walt.
You like that.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.291
Just leave me out of
the school plays, okay?

45:35.360 --> 45:36.486
I'm not comfortable with it.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.485
Now, I have allotted
us each $8 per meal,

45:39.560 --> 45:42.245
so it looks like
you can get one of the...

45:42.840 --> 45:44.569
One of the salads
or a soup or...

45:44.800 --> 45:45.801
Sorry, I'm quick.

45:45.960 --> 45:48.327
The tomato soup for me,
please. That'll do it.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.165
I'm going to take a full
slab of the baby backs,

45:51.480 --> 45:54.131
and I'm going to take that
with mashed taters,

45:54.280 --> 45:58.251
hushpuppies and I'm going
to have a sweet tea.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.521
The fuck you are.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.322
I don't know what that means.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.284
I asked you to eat less food.

46:06.760 --> 46:07.921
What is wrong with you?

46:08.280 --> 46:09.770
This is a beautiful woman.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.161
You let her eat.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.169
No, he's right.

46:14.320 --> 46:17.767
You know, I've put on a little bit
of weight because of all the stress.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.883
Walter is a fireman.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.691
Yeah. It's okay, it's okay.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.565
He was in a pretty intense...

46:25.640 --> 46:26.721
She doesn't care.

46:26.800 --> 46:30.691
...accident last year, and
he injured his male parts.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.328
Oh. They're just
shredded down there.

46:33.480 --> 46:34.925
And now he can't work.

46:35.080 --> 46:36.889
He wants to fight fires,

46:37.960 --> 46:39.564
and he wants to
pee standing up.

46:40.040 --> 46:43.726
Don't you want to pee standing up?
I know you do, but he can't.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.926
Just bring two soups.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.846
And he can't lay with me
like a husband should,

46:48.920 --> 46:50.331
on account of the injury.

46:50.400 --> 46:51.560
And I don't even need him to,

46:51.680 --> 46:54.923
but he gets mad at me,
and takes his anger out on me.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.645
And then I feel
bad about myself

46:56.720 --> 46:58.290
and I feel ugly,
and then I eat.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.807
Lord knows, I know I eat.
I know I do.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.482
No, no. You just wait
right here, sweetheart, okay?

47:04.640 --> 47:05.846
Okay.

47:06.040 --> 47:07.200
I'm going to wait right here.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.321
<i>God.</i>

47:08.480 --> 47:09.561
You're breaking the rules.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.045
You understand that?
You're breaking the rules.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.964
Society can't function
without rules.

47:13.040 --> 47:14.166
Ah.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.287
You follow the rules, right?

47:15.360 --> 47:16.407
I sure do.

47:16.640 --> 47:18.244
Oh, yeah, how's that
working out for you?

47:19.200 --> 47:21.328
Yeah. Hold on just a minute.

47:24.320 --> 47:28.530
This is from the buffet,
and it is on the house.

47:28.680 --> 47:29.841
That's so sweet.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.286
Enjoy your soup.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.651
And if you have to pee, the
ladies' room is right back there.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.726
God bless you. God bless you.
All right. Okay, okay.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.371
You know what a sociopath is?

47:47.080 --> 47:48.684
Do they like ribs?

47:50.960 --> 47:53.930
Hey, how you doing? I need
one room, two beds, please.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.001
Oh, sorry.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.242
We only have
single beds left tonight.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.686
Are you kidding me?
Nope.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.888
We don't really mind.
I mean, it's an inconvenience,

48:00.960 --> 48:04.248
but my husband can't really
digest stuff anyway

48:04.360 --> 48:07.045
because of his intestinal surgery,
so just comp us the mini-bar.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.440
He can digest Pringles.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.762
Right, that's right. I'm Walt.
This is the wife, Myra.

48:10.920 --> 48:13.446
She's a functional idiot.
Wears diapers like a chimp.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.125
I'm running her
down to Disneyland.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.645
She loves the noise
and the sugar.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.767
He's just tired from the drive.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.410
We're going to have to figure
out the mattress thing

48:19.480 --> 48:20.845
because even though
I can't have sex with her

48:21.040 --> 48:22.724
due to my cock and balls
getting shot off

48:22.800 --> 48:24.040
in an apparent
warehouse fire...

48:24.080 --> 48:25.047
Oh, shit.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.640
I wouldn't share
a bed with her anyway.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.166
I'd much rather sleep on the floor.
Do you want to know why?

48:29.320 --> 48:30.321
Because you got no dick?

48:30.480 --> 48:33.370
Close. It's because
she repulses me.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.288
She's the worst
person I've ever met.

48:36.720 --> 48:39.007
Screw you. You got a bar?

48:39.160 --> 48:40.889
Yeah, the Foxhole.
It's across the lot.

48:41.040 --> 48:43.122
Thank you. You're not
going to the Foxhole.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.045
Hey. I don't need to go to Denver.
You need me to go to Denver.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.123
No splitting up.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.401
Do you still want the room?

48:49.480 --> 48:51.289
Yeah, I do, real quick.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.521
Fucking chimp on the loose.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.842
It's not my business, I'm
really sorry about your dick,

48:55.160 --> 48:58.960
but you got to treat your lady
better, or somebody else is gonna.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.000
Appreciate it. Are we on the set
of your talk show right now?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.483
Do you know what?
Being nice is a choice.

49:04.640 --> 49:05.880
Can I just get the fucking key?

49:06.400 --> 49:08.129
Uh... Oh!
Are you in a hurry?

49:08.760 --> 49:10.125
Oh, no.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.044
I have to go get
this magnetized,

49:12.120 --> 49:13.849
because it wasn't
magnetized properly.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.321
This might take a while.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.365
Can I have a double melon ball?

49:22.800 --> 49:23.961
Thanks.

49:25.600 --> 49:26.840
Is that a melon ball?

49:27.480 --> 49:28.527
Yep.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.606
Do you like milkshakes?

49:33.880 --> 49:35.245
I'm just trying
to have a drink.

49:35.400 --> 49:39.041
Sorry, that probably sounded like
a dumb pickup line, I apologize.

49:44.720 --> 49:46.484
I don't like milkshakes,
I love them.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.246
You're going to
flip out over these.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.448
Stu, mix us up
two grasshoppers.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.481
Oh!

49:56.800 --> 49:58.006
I'm Big Chuck.

49:58.160 --> 49:59.400
Yes, you are.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.207
I'm Margie.

50:01.320 --> 50:03.322
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
You, too.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.440
I love a man
that wears jewelry.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.250
Thank you very much.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.925
I like my turquoise
like I like my women,

50:12.080 --> 50:13.923
American and top-grade.
Oh!

50:14.520 --> 50:15.681
100%.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.364
100%.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.091
To you.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.090
You know what they say
about grasshoppers?

50:26.160 --> 50:27.161
Mmm-mmm.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.925
Hard on the outside and soft
and creamy on the inside.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.361
Oh, I always like
soft and creamy.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.363
I'm soft and creamy.
I know you are.

50:37.240 --> 50:39.402
Why don't we go make sure
that table's okay?

50:40.480 --> 50:41.606
Looks like it's in danger.

50:43.320 --> 50:44.651
Let me get your bag.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.327
I'd like you to get that,
like you to get that.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.600
I'll just get
your drink for you.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.642
Why don't you get that?
I'll get that.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.484
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

51:11.520 --> 51:12.521
I'm back.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.161
Agile.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.440
Quick like a panther.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.923
Cheers to you.
Cheers to you.

51:27.200 --> 51:29.680
Release it. Let it burn.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.004
Mmm!
Mmm mmm mmm.

51:33.680 --> 51:34.681
Down it goes.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.407
Hey.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.721
You're here five minutes, you
already made a friend, huh?

51:43.040 --> 51:44.405
This must be Walter.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.481
- Walter.
- Hello.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.642
Howdy, Walt. I'm Big Chuck.
Hi, there.

51:47.800 --> 51:51.043
I got to tell you, this little
Margie is quite a lady.

51:51.200 --> 51:53.202
- Oh, "Margie"?
- Sit your ass down.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.886
Drinks are on me. Stu's going to set you up.
I wish I could.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.042
Stu, let's get Walt a round.
His dick's broken.

51:58.200 --> 52:01.204
It's much, much too late.
Never mind, Stu. I got to...

52:01.360 --> 52:03.522
Honey, I got to
get you out of here.

52:03.720 --> 52:07.361
Here's the thing,
I don't want to go.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.561
But it's super late.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.041
We got to get all the way
to St. Louis tomorrow, so...

52:11.120 --> 52:13.282
Then you should go, honey.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.887
But you are with me, honey.

52:15.960 --> 52:19.487
All right, listen up. I don't want
to get between husband and wife.

52:19.560 --> 52:22.040
You're not. You're not, believe me.
Is it Chuck?

52:22.200 --> 52:23.770
Yeah, Big Chuck.
Big Chuck.

52:23.880 --> 52:27.805
You're not, Big Chuck. I get it.
So, can we?

52:28.720 --> 52:30.085
I think we got a good one.

52:30.400 --> 52:31.447
What is that?

52:31.520 --> 52:33.045
I think we got a good one.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.925
Listen, I'm going to
tell you what's going on.

52:37.440 --> 52:40.250
Walt likes to watch.

52:40.880 --> 52:42.245
Walt's a watcher.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.001
Oh!

52:45.240 --> 52:46.287
No.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.806
You like to spectate, huh?
That's funky, man.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.008
You like a show?
He loves it.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.686
Okay. He likes to
just plan it all out,

52:53.760 --> 52:56.081
like what he's gonna say
and his little outfit.

52:56.160 --> 52:58.640
His gray shirt and his
stupid hands on his hips.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.006
He's like, "I'm gonna
come in and say,"

53:00.080 --> 53:01.764
"'What are you doing
with my wife?"'

53:01.840 --> 53:03.444
But what he really wants is...

53:03.760 --> 53:04.966
He likes to watch
me with other men.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.121
He does?

53:06.280 --> 53:07.611
Yeah, that's how
he gets aroused.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.205
You got a little
bone-bone now, huh?

53:09.400 --> 53:11.368
I'd really like to go, though.

53:11.520 --> 53:13.887
Here we go. It's time to go.
He said so.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.161
Yeah.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.890
And I'm going to go
out on the dance floor

53:16.960 --> 53:18.007
and we're going
to dance real slow.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.047
No, no, no.

53:19.120 --> 53:22.567
And we're going to dance real
close, and you can stay and watch.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.007
Or you can go.
That's your choice.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.730
I can't go.
You know I can't go.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.041
Thanks for your help, pal.

53:28.360 --> 53:31.284
Well, well.
We got us a watcher.

53:31.520 --> 53:34.091
Ohhh! We got a watcher!

53:35.840 --> 53:37.001
Honey, look.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.962
Walt!

54:05.640 --> 54:07.404
Let's drop this sucker
into first.

54:07.480 --> 54:10.404
Let's take this party up to the room.
All right.

54:10.680 --> 54:15.049
Do you realize how long it's been since
I've been touched below the waist?

54:15.680 --> 54:16.681
It's been a long time.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.810
You really want me
to answer that?

54:18.880 --> 54:21.406
Ain't happening tonight, either.
Oh, yes, it is!

54:21.480 --> 54:22.970
Hey, you snuck up on me. Hey!

54:23.040 --> 54:24.041
Come on.

54:25.680 --> 54:27.250
Thanks for the walk home.

54:27.400 --> 54:30.768
We made it, but as you can see,
lam getting ready for bed.

54:30.960 --> 54:34.726
Please say your goodnights. No,
no, meaning, "Leave, please."

54:35.400 --> 54:36.640
Don't shut the door.
Leave it...

54:38.000 --> 54:39.240
Now what do I do?

54:39.400 --> 54:41.767
Oh, now, this is
his favorite part.

54:41.960 --> 54:42.961
Okay.

54:43.080 --> 54:44.570
He likes to be
humiliated verbally.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.766
No, I don't.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.888
You little sissy boy. Huh?

54:47.960 --> 54:49.086
It's enough of this.

54:49.160 --> 54:51.731
Sissy boy, huh?
You hard now?

54:52.240 --> 54:53.241
I'm inverted.

54:53.360 --> 54:56.728
Now it's time to give him
the Big Chuck show.

55:01.400 --> 55:04.244
No need for the show.
Put it back on.

55:19.240 --> 55:21.288
Mmm-mmm.
I've had enough show.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.041
Oh! Shake it,
shake it, shake it!

55:27.760 --> 55:30.206
Ohhh! Look at him
peeking over here.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.964
I can't let her
out of my sight.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.441
He's not going anywhere. You
are right in his sweet spot.

55:34.640 --> 55:35.846
Now what do I do?

55:36.000 --> 55:38.685
I want you to
take him physically.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.127
Let's not cross a line.
Hey, Chas.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.930
Relax, Walt.
Friend.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.525
Big Chuck likes to share.

55:44.680 --> 55:45.806
I don't want
anything you've got.

55:45.960 --> 55:49.601
Why don't you and me share?

55:49.880 --> 55:50.927
Okay. God damn it.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.286
I'm sleeping in the bathroom.

55:53.480 --> 55:55.562
Oh! Here it comes.

55:55.720 --> 55:58.007
There it was, right there.
Uh-oh!

55:58.840 --> 56:01.127
Looks like it's
just me and you now.

56:03.720 --> 56:08.487
It sure is. I'm going to
make tonight so special.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.848
Backing up. Oh, no!

56:11.000 --> 56:12.923
You know what?

56:14.800 --> 56:17.007
I'm going to swim in there.

56:19.080 --> 56:23.404
I'm going to make you one of
my special famous cocktails.

56:23.560 --> 56:26.530
Well, I hope that cocktail
has a punch.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.648
Oh, you know what?
You're going to love it.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.401
I'm going to love it
because you made it.

56:35.480 --> 56:37.767
It's going to be so good.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.602
I don't know if I can do this.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.210
Yeah, that's okay.

56:59.360 --> 57:02.489
I wasn't really in
the mood for it anyway.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.085
No, I'm sorry.

57:04.240 --> 57:05.401
It's not a big deal.

57:05.480 --> 57:08.404
It's just that I ain't been with
another woman since my wife passed.

57:10.320 --> 57:14.962
And I'm sorry, because here you
are, and you're so beautiful.

57:16.960 --> 57:19.008
And you're so colorful.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.728
You look
like Dorothy from <i>The Oz.</i>

57:24.280 --> 57:25.645
Flowers.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.327
And I do, I appreciate y'all

57:30.400 --> 57:34.803
inviting me up here to your super
fucking weird sexual tryst,

57:37.640 --> 57:38.641
but I'm scared.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.570
Oh, Big Chuck.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.405
I do like you.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.930
I really do.

57:51.240 --> 57:53.163
Margie.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.881
Yes?

57:55.640 --> 57:57.608
I do want to make love to you.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.769
Oh, my God. Take me.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.121
Oh, God!

58:09.280 --> 58:11.248
Call me Big Papa Huge Time.
Big Papa Huge Time!

58:11.400 --> 58:13.323
Call me Big Papa Huge Time.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.970
Big Papa Huge Time!

58:16.320 --> 58:18.129
Shut up!

58:18.520 --> 58:19.885
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

58:19.960 --> 58:21.007
Feel the thunder, baby!

58:21.120 --> 58:22.645
Get on top!

58:24.280 --> 58:26.123
Fuck me!

58:26.320 --> 58:27.606
Break my hip!
I'll break it.

58:27.720 --> 58:28.960
Break my fucking hip!

58:29.160 --> 58:32.607
Rub it clockwise!
Clockwise, clockwise!

58:32.920 --> 58:34.649
What do you say?
I say, "Mama."

58:34.800 --> 58:36.962
Stick them both in. Pull them taut.

58:37.120 --> 58:39.088
How many is that?
What the hell is that?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.281
Come on!

58:40.360 --> 58:41.646
Stop! Foxhole! Foxhole!

58:42.160 --> 58:43.764
The safe word's "foxhole,"
God damn it!

58:51.600 --> 58:52.965
Here it comes!

58:53.400 --> 58:54.401
Mmm.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.410
Big Chuck will be ready for
round two in just a minute.

58:57.520 --> 59:00.649
I'll tell
you, Walt's a lucky guy.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.163
You are such a good person.

59:29.120 --> 59:30.121
Diana?

59:38.080 --> 59:39.081
Diana!

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.289
<i>Hello? Daddy?</i>

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.647
<i>Daddy. Hello?</i>

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.841
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.205
Fuck.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.122
I was just checking our ice.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.001
Morning.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.167
I just have flashes of
hearing an elephant and...

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.482
Oh, God.
I'm just real sore.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.608
I'll bet you're just torn to shit.
Get in the car.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.160
I think he really ripped it.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.481
You might have to look.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.642
I'm going to return the
card key to the front desk.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.489
I'm going to be watching. If you
take a step out of the car,

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.971
I'm going to kill you. I'm serious.
Get in the car.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.247
I got to have the keys.
I got to put the air on.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.890
Never going to happen.
Swing a leg.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.440
Can you get me
some Strawberry Quik?

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.084
Because I gotta
balance my electrolytes.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.241
If they've got it.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.689
Strawberry Quik.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.331
Hey. Good morning.
I'm checking out of 192.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.047
Did you enjoy your stay, sir?

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.121
No.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.526
That's good.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.489
Do you sell Strawberry Quik?

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.210
Yes. You want some?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.681
Not today.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.284
This coffee over here free?

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.044
Yeah.
Super.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.330
Creamer used to be 50 cents, but
everyone was stealing it anyway.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.530
Okay.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.727
The interstate is just south of here, right?
Is there a gas...

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.566
You fucking dick!

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.129
No, no! God! Ow!

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.402
No! Shit!

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:57.811
Hey!

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.127
Hey!

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.081
Hey!

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.365
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, there.</i>

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.481
Got her.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.927
See you in an hour?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.445
<i>Yeah, why don't you bring
her to the Atlanta office?</i>

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.761
<i>It's right off the 75...</i>

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.082
Excuse me, sir.
Did you take my friend?

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.611
I gotta go. No.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.046
Come on, I saw you take her.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.049
Well, then don't
ask me, shithead.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.600
Sandy! Get me out
of this fucking van!

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.926
I got it.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.690
Hey! Can you pull over, pal?
I need her.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.684
Your girlfriend's
in a lot of trouble.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.410
She's not my girlfriend.
Watch out.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.090
Hey! You get back there!

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.646
Hey, buddy.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.564
That's not Sandy Patterson.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.210
Yes, it is.
No, you got the wrong guy.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.964
It's me, I'm Sandy Patterson.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.610
No, Sandy's a girl's name.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.125
It's not, it's unisex!

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.725
What, like a hermaphrodite?

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.325
Sandy!

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.561
Fuck you, tranny!

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.768
Get me out of this van.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.921
Hey, hey, hey!

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.321
Shit.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.009
Hey, hey, I got her first.
Pull over.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.208
You can't have her!
Shit!

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.965
Shit.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.001
Motherfucker.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.210
Listen, God damn it!

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.566
Ram him.
Do what?

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.324
Ram the quarter panel.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.409
I don't have collision on this!

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.761
I don't give a shit!
Ram him!

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.921
I'm not doing it.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.405
You son of a bitch.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.246
Get in the back!
No!

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.562
Get off of me, you asshole!

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.361
Shit.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.771
Did you punch him in the neck?

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.405
I can't get him off the wheel.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.721
Pull over to the side.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.207
I can't get him
off the wheel. Ram him.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.930
I'm not comfortable with it!

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.809
I don't give a shit!
Ram that panel!

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.361
Shit.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.245
Hit it harder,
you fucking vagina!

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.567
I'm going to be sick.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.766
You Okay?

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.484
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.801
Are you okay?
Oh, shit.

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.166
That was so violent.
Tell me you're all right.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.361
I am all right. Yeah.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.646
Okay. All right, okay.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.761
Oh, God.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.440
Okay. All right. This guy
does not look great.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.521
Hey!

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.086
Oh, God.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.811
Maybe he's just...

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.081
That doesn't look good.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.322
I can't believe I did that.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.805
You did it. You did it.
God, you did it too hard.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.690
I tried a small one
on the first one.

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.041
And you said...
What did you call me?

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.168
I called you names, okay?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.924
Your rental car doesn't
even have a scratch on it.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.323
Yeah, that's great news.
The car is fine.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.681
What's more important...

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.726
God. My glasses
were in there.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.249
Well, you've come
to the right man.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.051
Anybody looking to buy or
sell anything around here,

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.531
they come through me.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.449
All right.
How much is this one?

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.804
That one is 350,000.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.041
350?

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.568
I can get this for 100,000,
easy, at a short sale.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.202
Well, I'm impressed. Clearly, you
both have done your research.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.010
So, I'm also sure that you know

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.730
that this is
a traditional community.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.202
What this means?
"Traditional"?

01:08:17.399 --> 01:08:19.288
It means no homosexuals.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.966
It means no foreigners.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.969
It means no blacks.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.890
We are two of those things.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.644
Hey, you two of these things.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.804
I mean, around these parts,
you're basically black.

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:35.920
And a foreigner.
I'm just black.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.729
Now, understand, me myself?

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.082
I am not a judgmental man.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.243
But you should know that the
buyers and the sellers here,

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:44.685
their values are more...

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.841
Traditional.

01:08:46.479 --> 01:08:47.606
Bingo, sister.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.604
Traditional, like meeting
whores at hotel bars?

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:54.327
Who are you?

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:57.046
Your whore,
she's in a rental car.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.010
We called up our friends in the
company, they look up the Lo-yack.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:01.281
The what?

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:04.011
LoJack. Foreigners,
they can't say J's.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.760
And they say it's at a hotel.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.484
The people at the hotel
gave us a story

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.326
about you and another man and her,
all sexing together in a pile.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.331
It's disgusting.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:16.051
But to answer your question, the
Lo-yack is an excellent product.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.850
It makes our work much easy.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600
What kind of work?

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.723
This our work.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.881
Oh.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.327
Very traditional.
Know what I'm saying, Chuck?

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:31.008
Now, who is she with,
and where is she going?

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:33.169
It's not a true allergy,

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.085
but there's definitely
a sensitivity.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.770
I need that other roll of tape.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.161
What are you doing?
Is he still... Tape?

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.647
I need the other roll of tape.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.529
You're taping him?

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.411
Oh, Jesus, it's here.
Yes, I'm taping him.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.966
No, no. Oh, no!

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.809
God damn it!

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.525
I told you it
was going to overheat.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.080
I said you better
coast down the hill.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.607
How am I supposed to propel down
the fucking highway in neutral?

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.290
I said I could show you.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.011
I'm going to give you a juice.
It's fruit punch.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.281
Yeah, that's nice and juicy.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.447
These are nice,
I'll tell you that.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.284
God, you keep yourself up.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.410
That's just...

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.450
Oh, God, your beard
smells like sandwiches.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.521
That's nice.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.210
Okay, listen, the...

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.406
Say goodbye to
your art project.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:45.720
The bus station's
down the road.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.330
- We can walk it. Let's go.
- Coming.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.050
Wherever you are,

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.689
you better believe I'm going
to find you, or die trying.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.206
All right.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.684
I get it, scary, survival,
end-of-days guy.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.161
You should be nicer.
I gave you juice.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.084
No, it was a van that crashed.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.720
A couple of people
got in, drove away.

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.646
Kind of an average fella,
short gal, somewhat wide.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.451
Took off north
on the 520 right there.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.851
Yeah, I'm fine. We're
still on course, honey.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.326
I don't know. Where Yoda lives.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.887
"These are not the droids
you're looking for."

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.041
Remember...
Tell her that.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.847
I know it. Honey, you're
breaking up a little bit.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.209
Honey? Hello?

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.001
Shit.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.049
How's everything going at home?

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.810
I don't know.
We didn't get that far.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.962
Because I'm out here.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.486
I guess I should thank you
for saving me back there.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.841
You're a good friend.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.007
I'm not your friend.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.242
I am not your friend,
we're not hanging out.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.529
I heard you yell to that guy,
"Did you take my friend?"

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.206
Yeah, that's a saying. You haven't
heard that saying before?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.681
Besides, friends don't steal
friends' identities, do they?

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.481
You're diabolical.

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.966
Well, thanks.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.320
That's not a compliment.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.521
I know.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.045
Here we go.
Here we go.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.244
Aw, come on!

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.561
You're doing great.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.521
You are going to have to
hide on the next one.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.891
It's clearly you.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.246
Oh, it's me.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.609
I have never been passed up
when I got this thing out.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.040
I don't doubt that you do
real well on the side of the road.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.411
But I don't know why
you're not trusting this.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.561
Stop for one second.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.086
It is only two miles
straight through there.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.969
Two miles through the woods?

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.728
Yeah. Are you allergic
to woods or something?

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.684
Come on, you want to go
10 more miles on this road?

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.881
Get some more blisters?

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.122
Come on, that's a shortcut.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.967
Yes? There's a yes. Finally.

01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.649
I knew you were probably wrong.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.161
I knew your phone
was going to die.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.640
I should've said something.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.962
You knew it. What are you?
You're like a psychic, huh?

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.929
Well, you know what? I am.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.640
I'm not going to
get into it, but I am.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.331
Really? On top of everything
else, you're a psychic.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.130
That's amazing.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.970
Pick a number between 1 and 10.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.805
Four.
Four.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.811
I know, it was a gift.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.367
Your gifts abound.
That's amazing.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.204
I think so, too.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.445
Then why don't you rest
your talents, Megamind.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.250
The sun is going to
be up in a few hours,

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.448
and we'll take it
the rest of the way.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.843
Hey, hey, hey. Spread out.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.729
You've got the whole forest,
what are you doing?

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.121
It's cold. This is what
they do on Survivor.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.647
When they want to get punched?
Get off of me.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.564
Do you usually listen to music

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.806
before you go to bed?

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.247
No, just a lot of silence.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.086
Oh, my God.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.086
You're like a four-year-old.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.521
You know, this light is very
flattering on your chin.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.929
Oh, my God. Diana.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.606
I'm serious, get your hand off. Please,
I don't want to play footsies.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.886
I'm not doing anything.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.124
Snake! Snake! Snake!
Oh, my God!

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.321
Shit.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.084
Get away from me!

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.761
Throw him! Throw him!

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.320
Oh, God, it was so close to me.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.170
Thanks for the help.
You're welcome.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.651
This is no longer
our sleeping spot.

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.006
There's probably
a fucking ton of them.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.083
They're not
pack animals, Sandy.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.004
I know they're not
pack animals, okay?

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.761
But have you ever heard of a snake nest?

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.961
Oh, shit.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.281
Just the mere thought of that
is going to keep me up...

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.846
Oh, God.

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.121
Don't move.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.645
Not a problem.
I'm not moving.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.450
Shit, it's huge!

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.130
No shit. Get him off me.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.487
Okay. I got it.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.480
What's the plan with the fire?

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.646
What are you
doing with the fire?

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.767
Get away from me
with that thing.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.002
I saw it on a television show.
Snakes hate fire.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.481
Unless that was about spiders.
I don't know.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.290
You're going to burn me, and
you're going to piss him off.

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.806
Get away from me.
Be quiet and stay still.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.160
Get away from me
with that thing.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.330
Oh, God!

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.006
That's not helping.

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.527
It just keeps looking at me.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.327
Oh, he's tightening.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.170
Turn your face away.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.287
Okay.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.488
It's almost over.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.170
Trouble.
He's got the neck.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.290
God! Don't let it
come near me.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.447
That hurts!

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.527
That hurt. That hurts!

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.841
Oh, God.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:18.681
Okay.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.848
Okay. Go slow, fella.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.731
Just go slow. Easy.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.570
Where are we?
What is this?

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:30.200
Bus station, middle of nowhere.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.281
Whose pants are these?

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.084
I got them out of
the lost and found.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.046
It's a good fit, huh?

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.607
Yeah. Okay.
Better get on a bus.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.240
We're not getting on any bus
for three days, not to Denver.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.321
What?

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.767
There's not a bus from here
to Denver for three days.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.246
Hey. When's
the next bus to Denver?

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.446
Wednesday.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.246
Fuck! That's too late.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.126
Phone's gone, wallet's gone
because the pants are gone.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.650
We're done. I'm done.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.604
I lose, you win.
You're a great thief.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.449
I got nothing left.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.844
I got no money, I got no time,
I got no job, I got no chance.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.285
I've got these weird pants on,
out in the middle of nowhere.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.885
How did we get here anyway?

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.725
I carried you.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.801
You what?

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.041
I carried you.
It's not a big deal.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.727
You were unconscious.

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.291
We were like, a half mile
from the main road.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.527
Jesus Christ.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.570
So, I just I scooped you up
and flagged down a truck

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.371
and he gave us a ride here,
dropped us off.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.526
You carried me a half mile.
That's, uh...

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.445
Probably not even that far.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.046
You get these shoes the same
place you got the pants?

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.646
No. Yeah.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.440
The clerk said an EMT took
them off a dead hobo, so...

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.047
Come on.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:23.360
He's not going
to need them back, so...

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:25.483
A guy died in these?

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.687
Because you needed shoes.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.211
What is the matter with you?

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.924
My socks, though...

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.525
They're your socks,
they're not dead guy socks.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.921
I've got money in here. I've got money.
I got sock money.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.001
We don't have...

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.730
What the hell?
Hey.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.565
Why are we living like animals if
you've got money in your socks?

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.001
I've got $300 and I need to
be in Denver by Tuesday.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.527
You can get a pretty cheap car
over there at Andrew's.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.569
Tell him Carl sent you.
He's a good man, Andrew.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.006
He was with my
sister for a bit.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.167
Oh, yeah?

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.682
You got a beautiful yard here, Andrew.
Here's 200 of the finest.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.285
Keys? Thank you.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:00.807
Ooh! And it's got satellite.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.209
I'm glad we're not
buying that one. Jesus.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.930
Morning.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.886
Morning.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.324
I'm supposed to be
meeting some friends here.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.324
Was there a man and a lady
come through here?

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.244
Both answer to the name Sandy.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.287
Well,

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.089
we get tons of
people through here.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.844
Ahhh!
I've had a shitty day

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.924
and you got a face that
looks like a dog's asshole.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.161
Were they here or not?

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.641
They came through earlier.
I sent them to get a car.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.807
Where?

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.211
Andrew's Auto Salvage.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.646
Write it down.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.290
I wasn't here.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.841
Thank you.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.689
Consider that a warning.
We need her more than you do.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.764
Better luck next time, old man.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.206
Fuck you.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.880
Shh!

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.650
That's what I always
thought, but then I thought,

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.006
"You know what?
I'm going to do it."

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.889
"I'm going to wallpaper the
garage." And I found...

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.088
First I thought, "Well, is
that going to be crazy?"

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.611
But it's not really that crazy,

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:56.523
because I found something
kind of thematically on point.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.762
You wouldn't rather just listen to this?
That's a good song.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.208
Oh, it is a good song. I like that.
It's got tires on it.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.364
It's wallpaper with tires,
which I thought was...

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.441
Ow!

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.170
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.369
I think it would be so cute.
It's red and...

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.205
God damn it!

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.249
It was one of those badgers. Oh.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.122
How great is the ride
on this Caprice, huh?

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.044
You know this is
the last tank, right?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.724
This is not going
to get us to Denver.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.724
You know, I could help us out.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.445
How? Did you find
some sock money?

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:51.167
No, I didn't find sock money. But
I've got my credit card burner.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.482
I can get a card, fill this
tank up in 15 minutes.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.291
I told you, this trip
will not turn me into you.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.442
I am not saying
that we have to go out

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.443
and steal from orphans
and baby puppies.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.165
No one deserves
to get stolen from.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.084
I don't know why you don't get that.
Just drop it.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.322
I get it,
I just find it bizarre

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.488
that you don't have
any kind of shit list.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.721
I find it pretty
hard to believe

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.881
that you can't come
up with one person

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:14.004
that deserves the wrath
of Sandy Patterson.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.370
My old boss, Harold Cornish,

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.490
is a partner here at this
major financial institution.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.880
They have got a branch here in St.
Louis. Here is the plan.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.760
<i>We're gonna go inside, we're gonna
get his financial information</i>

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.484
<i>for your little
credit card toy.</i>

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.688
<i>Social Security numbers, bank
account numbers, routing numbers,</i>

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.326
<i>it's all stored on hard copies
in there, in the Record</i> Room.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.845
<i>We just need a little
code to get in there.</i>

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.082
<i>Yeah, but we can't get in
there with you looking like that.</i>

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.811
<i>That's a great point.
There is a way around that.</i>

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.082
Oh!

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.921
Are you okay?

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.761
What is it? What is it?

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.451
My fibromyalgia. Oh, God,
my leg is cramping up.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:51.851
What can I do? What can I do?
Oh, God. Rub it.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.081
Rub it?
Rub it! Rub it!

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.286
Rub it! It's cramping.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.001
Oh!

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:58.841
Up?

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.161
Higher, higher, higher.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.361
Higher.
A little higher.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.601
Oh, God, it's in my glutes.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:09.966
Get in there!

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.360
How is this helping you?

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.171
On, God!

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.489
God, get in there!
All right, get off me.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.607
Get off me.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.641
I thought it was gonna
be a couple of offices.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.325
No. Come on.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.401
Who is this guy?

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.327
That's Accounts Processing. That's
the "me" of this branch. Come on.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.811
Oh. That shouldn't
be any problem.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.600
No offense, but just
keep your mouth shut.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.643
This will be over in a minute.

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:50.451
Hi. Good morning.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.003
Tina... Van Westengarden.
How are you?

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.288
I'm fine. Can I help you?

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.007
I'm here with my boss, Harold Cornish.
We're in from Denver.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.730
Oh. I'm familiar
with the name.

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.120
I'm sure you are.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.160
We're gonna need to get
into your Accounts Room.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.160
Do you have
an authorization letter?

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.962
I'm gonna be
real honest with you.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.451
I fucked up.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.165
I just kind of completely blanked
on that authorization letter.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.324
He basically runs me 24-7.
He's...

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.131
Cornish is... He's a handful.
I mean...

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.169
Honestly, he's an asshole.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.241
And I'm just hoping that we can

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.040
figure something out, and you
can do me a solid and...

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.207
You know, I don't think you
want to see me shit-canned.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.881
On my birthday.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.845
'Cause I'm getting married.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.161
This weekend...

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:55.045
'Cause I got pregnant.

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.001
Just a sec.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.846
Twins. And my cat died.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.041
How are we doing over there?

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.810
We doing good?
You calling security?

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.247
You better not be calling security.
Hang up the phone right now.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.487
I wasn't calling security.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.965
Yes, you were. Hang it up.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.645
Right now.

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.281
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed
back there without authorization.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.290
I'm not... You're not allowed
back there without authorization.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.761
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.402
I don't have to tell
you that we suspect

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.970
that there are some
people at this branch

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.680
that are doing some
very, very bad things.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.330
And I don't have to tell you
that I've been sent here

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.643
to look very quietly
at some records.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.805
Mr. Cornish, I don't mean any
offense, but we have rules.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.610
I know you have rules.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.330
Like never backdate a 5590

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.570
or don't stamp a 33-B transfer
without telling a client first.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.048
I bet you do that one
twice a month, don't you?

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.163
Tanya, can you give
us a minute, please?

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.482
It's Tina, but...

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.165
See what I mean?
What did I say?

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.600
Nothing. You said that.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.644
I have you at a disadvantage.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.127
You don't know me,
but I know you, Ken.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.126
I know that you
make $49,395 a year.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.170
I know that you work very hard for
that wife and child right there.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.121
I know that you're
real good at your job,

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.685
that you take care
of this company

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.411
and you do things that
they'll never know about,

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.686
that they'll never appreciate.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.569
So, you're very proud, right?

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.480
But you're scared.

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.048
You're scared because
you're dispensable.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.568
You're scared because you know
that, more than likely, one day,

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.088
you're gonna be replaced by
somebody younger, somebody cheaper,

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.327
maybe even by an app.

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.161
But not me.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.131
I'll be fine, 'cause I'm
on a different level.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.284
So if I don't get into that room
today, I'll be okay. But not you.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.885
You're still
going to be scared.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.204
And that's not fair, is it?

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.891
Here's what we can do, though.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.482
You can help me today and someday
I might be able to help you.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.250
But you're gonna have
to break the rules.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:54.881
9488.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.371
Got it.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.491
Let me see it.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.364
This is it. Right there.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.086
We got it.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.571
All right. That's what I need.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.690
Shit.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.571
Got it.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.484
Got it.
Wow.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.765
Okay, great. Good job.

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.366
Let's put this baby to use, get some
gasoline and hit the road again.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.927
Wait, wait, wait.
Hit the road? No, no.

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.402
I am exhausted. I need to sleep
for at least a couple of hours.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.927
I need something to eat
that doesn't come out of a bag

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.925
and I need to put at least some
of my parts into a shower.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.001
I bet you're a real mess.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.930
Do we get you
a Motel 6, or something?

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.286
Motel 6? No, no, no.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.042
Mr. Cornish, we go
wherever we want.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.882
Come on. Let's go.

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.201
I need a room, please.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.361
How about a suite?

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.442
Thank you, Mr. Cornish.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.766
Yes, hello.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:14.404
God, they're real. They're real.
Yeah.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:44.331
Just get there!
Get there! Get there!

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.001
I miss you.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.650
<i>I miss you, too, sweetheart.</i>

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.922
We're just gonna
rest for a little bit,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.082
and then one last
haul to get home.

01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:57.327
<i>Thank God.</i>

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.447
Have you talked to Daniel?

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.205
Yeah, spoke to Daniel.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.046
Oh! This place has
a shopping arcade.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.329
Reservation's at 8:00, okay?

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.686
And no jewelry.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.525
I'll get cash for tips.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.768
<i>Is that her?</i>
Yeah, that's her.

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.844
Okay. Drive safely, will you?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.968
Okay. I'll see you soon.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.282
Oh, that's a nice match.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.329
Now, that is a nice match.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:57.565
Oh, that's nice.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:03.564
No, dear. More is not more.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.723
Oh, that's better. Okay.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.526
She is the best.

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.241
Um...

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:40.444
Maybe you could help me.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.684
Oh, honey.

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:45.806
We'll take care of you.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.211
I've done a lot of
the groundwork for you.

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.327
Really!

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.045
It's really more
of a touch-up.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.365
Okay.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.081
Diana.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.121
What?

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.441
You look beautiful.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.241
It's just all...

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.122
It's all tricks and stuff.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.441
Not tricks, that's you.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.606
I said no jewelry.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:36.566
Oh, God, were you serious?

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:37.687
Yeah.

01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.644
Oh, God. You've gotta
work on your tone.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.649
It was my tone?
It's vague.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.967
It's not just the top, it's
the Lucite, too.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.207
This is great.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.522
I'd like to make a toast.
To you. Oh.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:51.603
I thought I was the enemy.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:56.450
You are, but I gotta admit,
you taught me something.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.001
Well, you taught me a few things.
You taught me

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.524
about getting what you want, and
you taught me about confidence.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.529
Maybe a little bit too much
about confidence.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.802
Did you see me with that
poor Ken Talbott today?

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.325
Yeah, you were
pretty hard on him.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.401
I know.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.650
But people have been hard
on me my whole life,

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.290
and I just don't want to feel
like the chump anymore.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:15.811
And you showed me that.

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.325
Did I?
Yeah.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.960
You also completely
messed up my life,

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.405
but I guess it needed
a little messing up,

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:22.920
needed a little bit
more Diana in it.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.166
Well.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.526
Or whatever your real name is.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:27.841
That is my real name.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:28.921
That's not. Come on.

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.321
It is.
We're friends now.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.731
That's my name, I don't
know what to tell you.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.485
Will you tell me your real name?
Finally, please?

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:36.761
What does it matter?

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.086
Exactly. What does it matter?

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.366
Fine, it's Marla.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.164
Why are you lying to me?
Just tell me your name.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.287
I don't wanna tell you.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.925
Don't get pissed off. I'm
not getting pissed off.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.331
Just drop it.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.403
This is weird. Why won't
you tell me your name?

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.647
It can't be worse than Sandy.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:49.846
Because I don't know it.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.002
Come on.
I don't know it.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.401
You don't know it.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.851
I don't know it.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.080
Really?

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.889
What about your family? What
about Morganville, Wisconsin?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.601
Are you telling me
that was all bullshit?

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:06.401
No. There's
a great little town.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.562
It's Morganville,
it's in Wisconsin.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.486
And there's a really nice little
police station in the center of town

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:15.689
where people that don't want
their babies can leave them.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.845
So, what name is
it that you want?

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.440
Because I had six of them by the
time I was through foster care.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.846
That's a...

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:28.050
That's a tough
life road to go...

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.568
I mean, no one who could have
helped you out maybe, early on,

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.041
and put you down
a different path?

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.201
No.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.571
No, there's been no one, ever,

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.722
to put me down
a different path.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.881
To do anything for me.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.645
There's never been anybody.
It's just been me.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.961
So, I don't give
a shit about people,

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:51.088
and people don't give a shit about me.
And that's just how it is.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.401
I give a shit about you.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.403
You don't give a shit about me.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.484
You just want me
to clean up my mess.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.085
You don't give a shit about me.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.571
And I know it.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.325
I have been on my own
all my life.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.766
Nobody even knows I'm here.
Nobody ever knows where I am.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.843
Because there is nobody.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.049
I got sick,
I took care of myself.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.929
I needed shit for school,
I got it.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.241
You're so stupid.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.369
Do you think your
fucking fancy suit

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.886
and acting like an asshole is
gonna make your daughters happy?

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:24.007
You think that's
what they want?

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:27.004
They want some big man
treating people like shit?

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.363
I would have done anything
to have somebody like you.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.931
Just to actually be there
and care about me.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.122
Just to fucking be there.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:40.363
You're such an asshole,
you're trying to be more like me.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.284
Nice choice, Sandy.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.965
Nice, I'm never gonna be able
to duplicate this makeup.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.281
Here.

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:56.805
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.481
I'm sorry.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.561
I'm sorry I gave you some
lame dumpster baby story.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:03.721
I was just lying.

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.769
That's what I do, I lie.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.485
Mr. Cornish.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.324
You are a fraud, a thief,

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.687
and an asshole,
whoever you are.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:20.524
You're both under arrest
for credit fraud.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.523
Stand up. Hands where
I can see them.

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.121
- He didn't do anything. He's just trying to get me...
- Save it.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.920
Put your hands in front of you.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.843
Okay. Come on, let's go.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:02.201
It's them.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.043
See you around.

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.681
Yeah.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.041
She got arrested.
What the hell do we do?

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:36.521
<i>Follow her to the station, you
bail her out and you kill her.</i>

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:39.687
Ahhh!

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:40.761
Damn it!

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.126
Burns, don't it?

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.089
You! What you do that for?

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.011
You shot me first.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.170
I didn't shoot you.
This bitch shot you.

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.121
Good point.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.970
You know what?
You're crazy!

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.966
Yep, diagnosis and everything.

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.205
Let's go for a ride.

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.930
Hey, man,
this is some bullshit.

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.447
If you wanna kill me, you
could just kill me right now.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.080
Gotta get in this
motherfucking trunk.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.561
I'm gonna get in this
motherfucking trunk for now.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:15.801
How did you find us?

01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.849
Same way you found them.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.571
Car had satellite radio,
tracked the GPS.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.485
What if we work together?
We split the cash.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.402
This ain't about
the money anymore.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.450
They wrecked my van,
this is personal.

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:35.091
Around, please.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.931
Hey, you guys have got
a pretty sweet ride, here.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:16.242
What is this?
An '08 or '09 Crown Vic?

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.446
'08.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.365
Ah! '08.
All right, I thought so.

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.646
What is this, like
250 ponies under the hood?

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.643
You can feel that, right?

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.480
I need you to close your eyes.

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.409
What?
And slide right.

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.444
What the fuck?

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.769
Hey! Pull over, pull over!

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.801
Jesus Christ!

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.921
Are you out of your mind?
This is a terrible idea.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:47.487
Hey! It's stuck.

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:48.971
Are you insane?
What are we doing?

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.280
We're getting away.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:52.363
All units, we need backup!
We need backup!

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.160
Put down your weapon!
Get out of your vehicle!

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.841
We can't go this way.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.206
Shit.
What now, huh?

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:08.927
Shit.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.721
There.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.082
Diana. Hey.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:44.326
Diana.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.286
Diana!

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.804
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.047
Get up, you fucking baby.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.090
Don't move!

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.569
Keep your hands up.
Put them on the wheel.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.165
Get out.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:21.084
Slow down. I got
punched in the throat.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.210
I got hit by a fucking car.
Did you see that?

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.680
What have you got in the trunk?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.040
I don't know anything about
the people in the trunk.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.646
Let me see your hands.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.688
My hands? He shot me!

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.966
They shot me first.

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:41.280
We're all going downtown.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:43.848
For what? I'm in a trunk.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.843
How about you do your little
handcuff trick for me?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.843
Just wait till we
get back to the car.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.240
Oh, come on,
just take them off!

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.528
Shut up and give me a minute.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.687
You should be dead.
You got hit by a car.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.484
I mean, are you even human?

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.369
It just looked bad.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:02.124
It sure did.

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.041
You know, the...

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.005
Part of the trick is
to just relax your legs.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.764
Better chance of
catching a roll.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.491
I read it on wikiHow.

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:16.008
You can make light of it, but
what you did saved my life.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.083
And thank you.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.449
You were only in that spot
because of me, so...

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.084
Fair is fair.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.961
Shit.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:39.242
You know you were right.
I don't want to go to jail.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.850
Please help me out.

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:45.961
I know.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:52.451
So, what, 900 miles to Denver?

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.881
Yeah.

01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.283
All right. Here we go, huh?

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.246
You want to buckle up?

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.169
You want to take
your tampon out?

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.203
Ready?
Yep, let's go.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:45.881
No, no, no, no.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.601
Hello?

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.330
Dad!
Daddy!

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.811
Hi.

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.081
Mmm!

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.725
Hi.

01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.926
Hmm.

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.330
Diana, Trish, Jessie, Franny.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.841
- Meet Diana.
- Hi.

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.361
Oh.

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.041
Hi.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:32.811
Nice to meet you.

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.371
Nice to meet you, too.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:37.285
Diana's gonna be staying
with us just for tonight,

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:39.169
and I'm going to take her into
work with me in the morning.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.810
If that's okay.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.322
It's kind of mandatory.

01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.881
It's a lovely dinner,
Mrs. Patterson.

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.041
Oh, thank you.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.684
I like how you decorated and...

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.569
Like, you put stuff on shelves.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.001
It's nice.

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:12.680
Thank you.

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.722
You've got some
food on your face.

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:26.606
Where?

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.648
Up here, like, in this area.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.649
No, you have food on your face.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.251
No, I don't have food
on my face. Where?

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.401
There!

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.330
- Here?
- No!

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:38.204
I would know.
It's not over here.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.084
- That's my clean cheek.
- Now you have three places.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:42.004
Here, here and here.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.323
You guys are driving me crazy,
because nothing's here.

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.241
Nothing's here.

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.681
See?

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.205
Babe, babe, mease.

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.445
Oh! That's a lot.

01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:05.850
Would you like
some help with that?

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.921
That's okay.
I'm almost done.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:13.601
I, uh...

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:16.806
I know you're
probably wondering

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.969
what happened on our whole
trip and the open road.

01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:28.650
And I just wanted to put your mind
at ease that nothing happened

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.326
between the two of us.

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:37.801
I put off a pretty intense
vibe, you know, sexually.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.370
Not intentionally.
I just... Put out a musk.

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:45.004
I just want you to know that

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.243
I put it out there,
but he did not pick it up.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.765
And, you know, there's...

01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.128
It's surprising.
'Cause I...

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:58.329
I don't know if you've heard
of the Bermuda Triangle,

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.681
which is kind of in here.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.841
And it's... You know...

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:09.689
Once you go in, it's real
hard to come back out.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.687
You know?

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:13.569
Because some people
don't want to.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.961
Some people just get lost
in there, emotionally.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:22.805
I just wanted you to know that
he was a perfect gentleman.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:27.323
And he did not lay a finger,

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:28.961
you know,

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.607
on, or in, me.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.851
Okay.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.961
You know, I, uh...

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.164
He really loves you.

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.445
Thank you.

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.170
Okay.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:11.528
She'd go away for, like,

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.731
10 years.

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.603
I mean, she's not a bad person.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.890
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm such a chump.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.570
You're not a chump.

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.129
If I didn't turn her in...

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.721
I mean...

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.005
We'd survive.

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.125
Diana.

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.563
I'm going in alone.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.490
Where's Diana?

01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:44.483
She said she had to go.

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.091
How long ago did she leave?

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.410
After she did our hair
and our makeup.

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.284
Well, as a shareholder
of the fund...

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.521
Couldn't make it happen.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.203
And to be honest, it wouldn't
have happened anyway.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.045
It just wasn't meant to be.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.125
Patterson.

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:53.801
Hi.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.490
Hi, Sandy.
Okay.

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.687
What's going on?

01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:59.401
That completes the statement process.
You've been read your rights.

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.249
This officer's gonna
take you into custody.

01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:04.490
Mr. Patterson.

01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.322
You are no longer a focus
in this investigation.

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:11.289
And she took responsibility for
everything that happened in St. Louis.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.880
I'd be happy to
provide your employer

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.251
with a letter
making that clear.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.081
You got your good name back.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.684
Congratulations.
Thanks.

01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.968
Could I have just one
second with her, please?

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:27.685
Sure. Let's go.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.406
Thanks.

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.490
I don't understand.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.122
Well, if I pop out of these that
quickly, he'll get all emasculated.

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:41.404
And there was
a pretty good chance

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:44.051
that this thing was gonna
end with cops, right?

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:47.365
I just didn't think
I'd still be here.

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:51.488
I just thought I'd take
advantage of a free ride,

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.207
and when I felt
like it, skip out.

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.290
I just didn't do that.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:00.130
How come you snuck
away this morning?

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.402
Because I knew you weren't
gonna turn me in.

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.689
And this was the right thing.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:11.891
I gotta go.

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.080
Thank you.

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:17.443
I really loved our trip.

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:33.921
Congratulations.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.206
Thanks.

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:38.127
This is you. Come on.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.729
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:53.127
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy</i>

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:54.770
Come on, girls.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.447
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.967
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:03.610
Okay, big breath, big wish.

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.170
Everybody together.
Close together.

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:08.521
Yay for Daddy!

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.611
Does Mommy want one more?
Yes.

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.644
Honey, honey, honey, please. Are
you kidding me? Mmm mmm mmm.

01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:16.929
You know what? Actually,
we'll take this to go.

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:19.890
We gotta go. It's very late.
Let's go.

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:21.963
I can't believe
how beautiful she is.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:25.451
I mean, to me, she still... She
really does look like a Diana.

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.601
Let it go.

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.491
I'm letting it go, but...

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:30.324
Sorry.

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:31.561
Are you kidding me?

01:53:31.640 --> 01:53:33.449
You are pulling these
out of your pocket. No.

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:36.171
I will shiv you in the yard. I
will shiv you in the yard, I will.

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:39.291
<i>All right,
visitation's over in five minutes.</i>

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.646
All right, break it down
for us real quick.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.650
Okay. Here we go.

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.081
Math, A.

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.161
Typical.

01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.571
Accounting, B.

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.721
Nice.

01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.126
And Econ?

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.248
Well, you know.
What happened?

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.164
You guys have been studying
for weeks, haven't you?

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.970
I know, but I just got this.

01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:56.486
Oh!

01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.685
Nice going.

01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:59.921
I know. I know.

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.240
I'm putting this in the file.

01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:04.802
Oh, come on, it's not like
somebody's gonna hire an ex-con.

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.811
I'm actually starting
a first step program,

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.371
and I have a few years
to figure it out.

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.930
Three, with good behavior.

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:13.082
And how is that going,
by the way?

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:14.281
Great. Great.

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:15.441
Decent, you know.
Good.

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.888
Some of these dykes are still really
getting up into my sweet junk,

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.530
but I don't let them.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.842
Girls, "sweet junk" is just...

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.964
Dessert. She's having
a problem in the mess hall.

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:27.041
We should probably get going.

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.566
The lesson there,
if you listen,

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.842
is that if you're in the woods,

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.209
maybe a boyish female bear
with corn rows

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:41.407
comes at you this way, meaning
this way, and you just deflect.

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:46.165
It is always nice to see
you, and we'll wait out...

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:47.401
Girls, let's get going.

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:50.046
What are you gonna do? Not let
them in, right? Come here.

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.690
Bye, Diana.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.569
Stay beautiful, okay?

01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.006
Okay, I'll see you
in a couple months?

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.844
Okay. Love you.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.445
Love you, too.

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:02.891
I got you something.

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.124
Ooh! I pulled some
strings with Reilly,

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:08.682
and we ran your fingerprints through
the Wisconsin state database,

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.405
and we got that.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:17.686
My name.

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.320
Dawn Budgie.

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:25.607
That's a terrible fucking name.

01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:27.730
It's a really bad name.

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.449
It's not as great as I
was hoping, but it's you.

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:34.605
Thanks, Sandy.

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.208
But I already know who I am.

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:49.929
Yep. Thanks.

01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.603
Back in your cage, bitch.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.244
Shit!

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.405
Budgie?

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.126
Sorry.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.689
<i>No, Sandy's a girl's name.</i>

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.285
<i>It's not, it's unisex!</i>
