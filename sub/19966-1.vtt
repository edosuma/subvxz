[Whip strike - Man groans]

01:43.800 --> 01:46.800
Yeah, thank you so much.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.600
What do you say?

02:36.700 --> 02:38.860
I want you to fuck me.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.400
Harder.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.160
God, I'm begging you!

02:56.200 --> 02:59.700
A simple "please"
is more than acceptable.

03:30.900 --> 03:37.460
I'm not sure of how or why
these things happen, but they do.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.260
And to be frank with you,
we have very few options.

03:41.300 --> 03:47.000
Sadly, this is one of the times
where medicine lies sorely behind.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.460
Since I'm not
your first consultation,

03:51.500 --> 03:56.260
you know it's my professional duty
to advise you regarding surgery.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.560
But you probably also know

03:58.600 --> 04:02.121
that could yield very little
in prolonging your life.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.298
I'm sorry.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.100
[Church bell]

04:34.500 --> 04:35.960
Really, Mason,

04:36.000 --> 04:40.660
is it too much to ask your secretary
to call me, to tell me you canceled lunch?

04:40.700 --> 04:42.460
I'm sorry, Beck.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.000
You said I had to be there
to sign papers.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.960
You know that girl, Susie Clyde,
that you played bridge with?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.560
Listen to me. Do you know
why her husband married her?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.760
Her father owns half of Korea

04:54.800 --> 04:57.660
and her father's got my balls
on a silver platter in fucking China.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.160
Stop it.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.660
First of all, you're talking
about two entirely different countries.

05:03.700 --> 05:07.200
Second, you know I can't stand it,
when you speak about people like that.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.560
Oh, yeah?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.660
I asked you to come down here
so that I can sign

05:10.700 --> 05:12.560
some of these stocks over
and put them in your name.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.160
So I can get out from underneath
this goddamn audit.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.560
You're not in some kind of trouble,
are you?

05:17.600 --> 05:20.860
We're gonna have to do a little
creative accounting, honey.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.860
And you're gonna have to help.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.060
So, sign the papers and…

05:25.100 --> 05:26.860
I don't know
if I'm gonna be home for dinner.

05:26.900 --> 05:30.400
It's important
that we eat dinner as a family.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.700
It sure as hell is.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
[Man groans]

06:12.600 --> 06:16.100
Been with a lot of you girls.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.900
Don't know why it is
so much better with you.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.100
Same time next week?

06:33.000 --> 06:40.000
[Birds chirping]

06:45.600 --> 06:47.700
[Seconds in a clock]

06:47.800 --> 06:50.460
- Wow, jeans and sneakers.
- Thanks a lot, Hank.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.160
Someone's a little
bitter they lost.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.000
Grow up.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.260
Loser.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.400
- Grow up.
- Bitter loser.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.060
I told you, you'd be late
if you played tennis.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.000
There some things
you just can't squeeze in.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.460
HANK: I had to get back the money
I lost last night.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.647
Oh, look at you.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.443
I told you:
no more Vegas weekends.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.660
How much?

07:16.700 --> 07:19.960
Would it help if I told you I fell
in love over the whole thing?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.160
You always tell us that
the money can't buy you love.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.160
Well, except for in Ace's case here.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.760
Leave Janice out of this.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.660
I think you
should leave Janice out of this.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.160
But then, what the hell
kind of a merger would this be?

07:32.200 --> 07:33.260
Stop it, Hank.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.060
- Marissa,
- Yes?

07:35.100 --> 07:37.060
Have you seen my calendar?

07:37.100 --> 07:40.160
No, I believe I saw it this morning
in Mr. Mason's office.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.460
Do you want me to go get it?

07:41.500 --> 07:43.060
- Oh, would you mind, please?
- Sure.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.161
Aaron!

07:44.800 --> 07:49.460
Aaron, do you plan
on being late for everything

07:49.500 --> 07:52.560
or only unimportant events
like our engagement party

07:52.600 --> 07:55.735
that my mother has spent
the last six months planning?

07:55.900 --> 07:57.660
HANK: You'll be
very pleased to know, mom,

07:57.700 --> 08:00.460
that I purposely let all that money
slip through my fingers

08:00.500 --> 08:06.100
figuring if she still loves me by the time
it's all gone, then maybe she is the one.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.000
No jeans. Go change.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.060
- Here you go, dear.
- Oh, thank you very much.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.160
You need some help here?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.460
Good, good, good
I got it, I got it.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.660
Thank you, Jess.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.360
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.121
Oh, my god.
We are so late!

08:28.300 --> 08:30.770
Don't forget to breathe!

08:40.400 --> 08:43.309
It's one of Valentina's girls.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.660
And so I'm telling you,

08:45.700 --> 08:47.160
she's trying to convince me
to get a nipple ring.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.060
It's gonna make everything
a bit more exciting.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.760
What is she talking about?
Nipple clamps?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.660
She is just fantastic.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.260
REBECCA: I'm so out of place here.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.100
- Don't worry.
- I'll get you a drink.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.336
- I need a drink.
- Okay.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.560
Oh, my god.

09:12.600 --> 09:17.060
She is just fantastic.

09:17.100 --> 09:23.860
She tied us together an then she strapped
a dual butterfly between us.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.760
- Butterfly?
- Oh, a vibrator.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.760
She is amazing. Okay?
I came three times.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.660
Then she had to pull me down
from the ceiling.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.000
No, I'm not kidding.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.060
So, you're having your ceiling repainted?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.800
Yeah, yeah.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.860
Well, we've heard
a lot of stories here tonight

09:47.900 --> 09:50.500
and I wanna hear your story.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.860
- My story?
- Yeah.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.712
Believe me,
I have no story.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.660
Well, you've got to have some story.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.066
I mean, what's your pleasure?
What do you like?

10:03.200 --> 10:07.560
What gets you hot?
You know, your fantasy.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.588
You don't have any answer for that?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.800
No, I'm married.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Oh, Becks.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.060
Is she playing coy with me?

10:16.100 --> 10:17.960
What is it

10:18.000 --> 10:21.924
that you just simply

10:22.100 --> 10:24.960
can't resist?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.990
You, evidently.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.992
It's late, and I would like to take
advantage of this buzz.

10:31.032 --> 10:33.979
Alright, ladies.
That's it for me.

10:34.019 --> 10:36.298
Oh, I like your pants.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.400
Oh, thank you.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.086
- Ooh, ooh, girl.
- She's very subtle.

10:44.700 --> 10:48.760
A double or like a triple heart bypass.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.013
Well, you hang in there.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.900
I know in your line of work
time is money.

10:54.200 --> 11:00.401
I'd like to compensate you
for my senior moments.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.676
No worries.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.060
What is it?

11:25.100 --> 11:29.060
I know it when I see it.
When you guys look at each other is…

11:29.100 --> 11:32.960
Even them, tonight.
I felt it.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.560
Oh, god!
You could have felt them in New Jersey, right?

11:36.600 --> 11:44.160
The truth is, we just are lucky.
But we work like hell. Don't we?

11:44.200 --> 11:46.360
We keep it exciting.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.660
Work I can do.
The other part is missing.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.860
Okay, huh…

11:57.900 --> 12:02.400
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told anybody.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.060
You know everything that
is to know about me, right?

12:13.100 --> 12:16.960
Well…

12:17.000 --> 12:22.460
I've never, ever…

12:22.500 --> 12:26.842
Baby, we know it's not good
between you and asshole.

12:26.900 --> 12:30.060
It's not that, no.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.960
What?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.460
Oh, for God's sake.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.418
Come on, out with it.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.760
I…

12:38.800 --> 12:41.860
I have never…

12:41.900 --> 12:45.012
You've never come?

12:56.500 --> 12:59.709
Exactly.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.160
SHIRIN: Mason?

14:07.200 --> 14:08.960
He is such a man's man?

14:09.000 --> 14:12.660
REBECCA: We just do it twice a year.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.960
We are both fine with that.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.160
Oh, Becks!

14:16.200 --> 14:18.360
Oh, you must have to masturbate.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.060
Don't say that word.

14:20.100 --> 14:23.202
What, "masturbate"?

14:23.500 --> 14:26.287
I've been to a bunch of doctors,

14:26.500 --> 14:29.660
a bunch of therapists.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.760
Something is wrong with me.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.060
What's going on, Rebecca?

14:34.100 --> 14:38.960
I've never once had that
passion in my life.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.560
Damn it.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.660
Is it so wrong for me to want…

14:43.800 --> 14:46.360
Come over tonight.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.860
Have dinner with us
and we'll come up with something.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.200
I promise.

14:51.700 --> 14:55.000
Am I like your project now?

14:55.300 --> 14:57.000
Right.
Forget your friggin schedule.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.482
Just be there at 8:00.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.393
You know what?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.000
What you need is a vibrator.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.000
No. That gives me the willies.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.499
KELLY: I know, weed.
Let's get her stoned.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.560
No, I don't do drugs.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.260
No, I do know.

15:20.300 --> 15:24.107
I think you should seriously consider
taking a lover.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.900
That is, if you don't mind
breaking your vows.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.300
No moral quandary there,
believe me, but…

15:29.340 --> 15:33.000
What am I supposed to do?
Just go to some guy in the street?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.860
No, no.
I mean a woman.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.120
What?

15:37.300 --> 15:38.860
A woman lover.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.460
Oh, come on.

15:40.500 --> 15:43.960
Just hear me out
and do not listen to her, okay?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.060
A woman is so much more
familiar with the manual.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.360
Who?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.560
Wait.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.060
I'm talking about a woman, you know,
who has all kinds of tricks up her sleeves,

15:53.100 --> 15:55.960
who's used to particular situations…

15:56.000 --> 15:56.960
And as it happens,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.360
I happen to have a second cousin
who runs this service business,

15:59.400 --> 16:02.560
and she could get you
hooked up.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.188
Service business?

16:06.200 --> 16:09.000
SHIRIN: Kind of the dark sheep of the family.

16:09.300 --> 16:14.400
SHIRIN: Valentina has got
the finest women I have ever seen.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.500
SHIRIN: Smoking.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.400
KELLY: Hey, hey, hey. Settle.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.000
Oh, my god.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.461
No one will ever find out.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.645
REBECCA: I thought that was just for men.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.062
REBECCA: Are you kidding me?

16:27.102 --> 16:29.860
I mean, women actually do that?

16:29.900 --> 16:30.860
SHIRIN: Oh, of course.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.860
SHIRIN: You have to think of this
as an experiment, okay?

16:34.900 --> 16:36.760
It hasn't happened with a schlong.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.100
You are hiring her for a service.
A very specific service.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.500
VALENTINA: No, no, no. That's fine.
Nothing is too odd for us.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.360
What have you got to lose?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.400
Not a lot at this point.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
[Telephone rings]

17:01.700 --> 17:04.160
Better to serve you.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.859
Oh, hi, Shirin.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.800
No, no, I'm sure
we can find someone for her.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.599
Fine. Consider it taken care of.

17:21.700 --> 17:26.160
Okay. This one should be fun.
Feel like educating?

17:26.200 --> 17:28.560
Oh, yeah.
What do you got, a virgin boy?

17:28.600 --> 17:29.760
Calm down, cougar.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.700
No, this is a housewife from the burbs
looking for a new adventure.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.500
SINGING:
Just a little Latin now.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.500
SINGING:
Just a little singing, we…

17:37.800 --> 17:39.500
Shut the fuck up!

17:39.700 --> 17:42.360
I am speaking to an employee.

17:42.500 --> 17:46.360
Sylvie, look, this is a friend
of my cousin's, okay?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.560
She's never been
with a woman before

17:48.600 --> 17:51.700
but my lesbian cousin has explained to her
that women make better lovers.

17:51.748 --> 17:53.700
Yeah. Tell me something
I don't know.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.260
And she's from money.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.460
So I want this to go really well.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.960
Just think
of all the referrals I could get

17:59.000 --> 18:02.200
from that upper crust stuffy
country club set of hers.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.460
So I want you
to do right by her, alright?

18:05.500 --> 18:09.160
And besides, she wanted
someone closer to her own age.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.660
Sorry.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.160
Now sing.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.800
SINGING:
I wanna feel this moment

18:14.840 --> 18:17.260
SINGING:
though I can't control it

18:17.300 --> 18:20.700
SINGING:
if it's all I ever do.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.960
That's what I'm going in with
for my audition.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.400
And then, when I cut my single,
I'm done with all of this.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.060
And what happened
to your other hits?

18:28.100 --> 18:29.460
Sylvie, play nice.

18:29.500 --> 18:33.460
Now, I handpicked you for this
and I don't want you to disappoint me.

18:33.500 --> 18:38.200
Sylvie, don't be late.
I hear she's a stickler for time.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.060
You know how much I hate
to ask you to take a call but it's Molly.

18:41.100 --> 18:43.760
She's invited me
to her fiance's parents house

18:43.800 --> 18:46.160
so it's a big fuck deal.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.100
I gotta go, okay?

18:48.300 --> 18:52.060
Client is fully vetted,
handpicked by Valentina,

18:52.100 --> 18:56.760
so crème de la crème,
all the good stuff, right?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.260
Oh, sweetheart, I love you.
Christ, I love you.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.460
Oh, fuck!
I almost forgot!

19:00.500 --> 19:05.000
The client is a real stickler for time
so don't be late, alright?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000

[Claps hands]

19:21.000 --> 19:23.514
Oh, shit.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.225
This is insane.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.021
What am I doing?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.100
[Knocking at the door]

19:48.200 --> 19:49.360
May I help you?

19:49.400 --> 19:51.064
Ms. White?

19:51.500 --> 19:53.083
Yes.

19:54.700 --> 19:56.860
I believe we have an appointment.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.966
I think you're mistaken.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.160
Four o'clock?

20:04.200 --> 20:07.413
I think there's been
some kind of a mix up.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.360
Well, you answered the door
as though you were expecting someone

20:12.400 --> 20:17.691
and I presume you don't live here
because I was just here two days ago.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.860
So again,
I believe we have an appointment.

20:23.900 --> 20:27.660
I had an appointment, yes.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.260
But with someone my own age.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.760
I get it.
You're expecting Sylvie, your usual?

20:31.800 --> 20:36.060
My what?
Will you come in?

20:36.100 --> 20:39.205
Come in.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.416
Are you from the service?

21:06.700 --> 21:10.560
Oh, Sylvie.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.660
So, this is your first time.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.360
You're nervous.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.160
It's perfectly natural.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.360
But you don't have to worry.

21:23.400 --> 21:29.560
We will go as slow and easy

21:29.600 --> 21:32.660
as you like.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.660
Look, Miss…

21:34.700 --> 21:36.760
Paris.

21:36.800 --> 21:41.960
Miss Paris, I asked
for someone my own age.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.960
Age is a state of mind, you know?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.460
Maybe for you.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.560
What are you, like 23?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.860
I'm 29.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.060
See what I mean?

21:54.100 --> 21:58.500
You're not what I asked for
and I'm not paying you.

21:59.700 --> 22:03.360
So don't be starting your clock
or whatever it is…

22:03.400 --> 22:05.560
I am sorry for the misunderstanding

22:05.600 --> 22:08.260
but the woman
who was supposed to be here

22:08.300 --> 22:11.456
had an emergency
and she asked me to fill in.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.860
I'm not paying you.

22:20.900 --> 22:23.860
I'm not asking you to.

22:23.900 --> 22:28.060
I am just politely
taking my leave.

22:28.100 --> 22:31.290
No hard feelings.

22:40.700 --> 22:44.500
I hope that next time,
you get what you're looking for.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.574
Mom?

What's going on?

23:44.800 --> 23:47.812
Come sit with me.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.813
Just come sit with me
for a minute, will you?

24:05.500 --> 24:09.667
I'm so sorry that I haven't been
a better mother to you.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.460
What's going on with you, mommy?

24:14.500 --> 24:17.637
Going through a midlife crisis
or something?

24:27.600 --> 24:30.560
Are you okay?

24:30.600 --> 24:33.873
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

24:36.400 --> 24:42.293
If only I had been stronger.

24:42.500 --> 24:46.800
If only I had been there
as I should have been.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.691
I am so sorry,
I should have…

24:54.900 --> 24:56.300
We agreed
not to talk about it.

24:56.400 --> 25:02.360
If we don't talk about it
we'll never get past it.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.560
Please.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.060
Some things we don't need
to get past, mom, so just…

25:08.100 --> 25:10.560
There must be something I can do.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.000
Not talk about it.
How about that?

I want to do better baby.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.960
I just wanna make it better.
How can I make it better?

Some things you can't fix.

So don't.

Oh, I see.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.760
Oh, that's pretty cute.

I like it.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.260
- Okay, I admit it was for the champagne.
-  Yes? You were there for the champagne?

26:10.300 --> 26:14.000
- Yeah, and the art.
- How was the art?

26:14.200 --> 26:17.500
There was big pictures
and a spotlight.

26:17.600 --> 26:20.400
I was gonna try
make a little tune.

Yes, I'm in love.

I am gifting you these stocks
as part of some estate planning.

Am I clear on that?
Do you understand that?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.131
What?

I am so sick of your greed
and your self-righteous ego.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.145
What?

27:05.100 --> 27:07.360
It was one thing for you
to send the boys to Harvard

27:07.400 --> 27:11.660
'cause I understand you want them
to take over your family business.

27:11.700 --> 27:17.260
And I even let you give a 100,000 shares
of Westridge United to the boys.

27:17.300 --> 27:21.260
Look, we're not gonna have
this conversation. Okay, Rebecca?

Look, I'm just a man, okay?

27:27.300 --> 27:29.760
I'm just the man
that you happened to marry.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.260
And I think on the whole,
I've been pretty good to Jessica.

a pretty charmed life.

in this business. You get it?

This business has been
in my family for 100 years

you and me, right from the start.

you want to say, Beck.

As a secretary with a 2-year-old strapped
to my hip, Mason looked pretty good.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.360
Okay, I get it.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.960
Security counts for a lot,
when you have a baby

39:08.000 --> 39:09.360
but it's not like owning a dog.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.560
That's what I'm saying.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.460
You'll make such a good mommy,
I mean…

39:12.500 --> 39:16.260
You just want to get me knocked up
'cause you think it'll stop me cursing, right?

39:16.300 --> 39:19.800
- It'll stop you drinking.
- Yeah, yeah, I was told that.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.605
You two are so lucky.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.160
What's it like?

39:25.200 --> 39:27.812
On the level?

39:28.900 --> 39:33.460
Being in love with Kelly

39:33.500 --> 39:39.660
is sanguine,

39:39.700 --> 39:41.308
erotic,

39:42.400 --> 39:44.257
delicious,

39:45.100 --> 39:46.700
magical.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.860
Downright mystical.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.500
But you know,
these are just words, you know?

39:52.600 --> 39:57.360
I mean them.
But I really want you to feel it.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.600
That was the plan.

39:59.800 --> 40:04.000
You asked for this - this thing.
Don't let this bitch stop you.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.560
You ask for this - this Paris
by name next time.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.160
But I'm serious, Becks, don't spend
the rest of your life settling.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.500
Don't do it.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.400
[Deep breath]

40:47.000 --> 40:48.400
[Knocking at the door]

41:16.300 --> 41:19.560
I'd like to thank you for coming.

41:19.600 --> 41:23.960
Third time a charm?

41:24.000 --> 41:28.160
I'm a little out
of my comfort zone here.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.160
You do that a lot.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.560
What?

41:32.600 --> 41:35.560
Check the time.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.900
Don't worry.
You'll get your moneys worth.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.500
That's…

41:43.400 --> 41:45.178
Good one.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.654
Funny.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.724
Would you like a drink?

41:52.000 --> 41:56.300
No. But go ahead.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.200
You don't drink?

42:03.800 --> 42:06.360
I thought it sort of
came with the territory.

42:06.400 --> 42:12.900
I like to concentrate on the details,
try not to get too fuzzy.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.860
You take your work very seriously.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.500
Yes, I do.

42:24.700 --> 42:29.560
So,

42:29.600 --> 42:32.700
what can I do for you?

42:56.400 --> 42:58.600
Have you done this with men?

42:58.700 --> 43:01.700
This? No.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.500
Are you a lesbian?

43:05.600 --> 43:09.300
Oh, god, no. I… Oh!

43:09.900 --> 43:14.160
For some reason,
I just thought that

43:14.200 --> 43:17.350
somehow this might be easier
with a woman.

43:24.300 --> 43:27.100
I wanna know what passion is.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.540
I wanna know
what an orgasm feels like.

43:31.800 --> 43:38.400
Well, they are two
distinctly different goals.

43:42.600 --> 43:47.125
It'll be whatever you want

43:47.600 --> 43:50.400
or need.

43:51.400 --> 43:56.536
But I think you should be clear.

43:58.300 --> 44:03.800
An orgasm is a physical phenomenon

44:05.100 --> 44:08.684
and that, I can help you with.

44:11.700 --> 44:17.500
Passion, is another thing entirely.

44:24.300 --> 44:27.000
No. Stop watches.

44:28.200 --> 44:31.500
No hatches.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.700
No shifts.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.822
Just…

44:54.600 --> 44:56.476
Lean back.

44:58.500 --> 45:00.300
Relax.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.600
Dad, can I have the Corvette?

45:02.700 --> 45:06.100
Yeah, but you know, you might actually
have to show up to work to get it.

45:17.900 --> 45:20.183
Mom, what's up with you?

45:24.600 --> 45:27.300
Something you want to tell us?

45:27.400 --> 45:29.000
No.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.605
Your wedding ring?

45:32.200 --> 45:33.860
Oh, that.

45:33.900 --> 45:38.560
I left it at the gym today.

45:38.600 --> 45:42.960
I already called.
They've already locked it in their safe.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.860
Damn well better baby,
because that thing is worth a fortune.

45:46.900 --> 45:50.460
Those things are definitely not cheap.

45:50.500 --> 45:54.260
Just wondering if it's worth it.

45:54.300 --> 45:57.400
What, the family you're marrying into?
Are you kidding? And that girl?

45:57.500 --> 45:59.615
Couldn't be better
if I picked it myself.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.900
But you did pick her yourself.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.860
More chicken, Mason?

46:11.900 --> 46:13.260
No, thanks.

46:13.300 --> 46:15.978
No, thank you.

46:19.300 --> 46:24.700
Okay, there is a Jewish guy,
a German guy and a French guy.

46:31.800 --> 46:35.660
I can't.
I'm so sorry I wasted your time.

46:35.700 --> 46:40.400
There is a reason
why you are here.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.818
I can't.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.100
[Sigh]

47:15.500 --> 47:18.160
So you wanted me to get
you something really special

47:18.200 --> 47:19.960
and he wouldn't make up his mind

47:20.000 --> 47:22.900
and it took for ever
and ever and ever, right?

47:23.100 --> 47:25.800
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna show her in a minute. See…

47:25.700 --> 47:28.860
Well I don't really know
if it's your fault or puppet's fault,

47:28.900 --> 47:31.700
but… I'm angry.

47:32.300 --> 47:35.500
But he wants me to get you this.

48:05.000 --> 48:12.500
[Phone]

48:08.300 --> 48:10.600
Okay.

48:11.300 --> 48:13.418
Needed that.

48:15.100 --> 48:17.572
Better to serve you.

48:18.800 --> 48:19.600
Oh, yes.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.860
Oh, yeah, absolutely,

48:21.900 --> 48:25.860
I'll have her wearing the Dorian glasses and…

48:25.900 --> 48:29.759
and she needs to bring the
blowup elephant and the gorilla.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.181
Certainly wouldn't want to bring
the wrong animal.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.060
Great.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.300
Oh, uh, excuse me, may I put
you on hold for a moment?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.360
Better to serve you.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.700
Yes, this is Mistress…
Miss White.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.460
Yes, yes.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.560
Do you have my ring?

48:51.600 --> 48:53.400
I must have left it at the hotel.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.860
Yes, she said you left that behind.

48:55.900 --> 48:57.760
Ah, good.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.460
No, don't worry.
These things happen.

48:59.500 --> 49:01.660
Can I swing by now and just…

49:01.700 --> 49:04.798
Well, actually,
it's not at the office.

49:04.838 --> 49:07.467
She said that you wanted
to make another appointment

49:07.600 --> 49:12.760
same place but at 7 p.m. and
that she would bring it to you then.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.660
What?

49:13.700 --> 49:16.560
Are you happy
with that arrangement?

49:16.600 --> 49:18.460
Mrs. White?

49:18.800 --> 49:20.300
Are you confirming?

49:20.700 --> 49:23.250
That little bitch.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.300
[Knocking]

50:11.800 --> 50:14.300
Do you have my ring?

50:18.100 --> 50:19.900
Well, may I have it?

50:27.400 --> 50:29.960
Pretty.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.660
It is pretty damn expensive.

50:31.700 --> 50:34.060
And if you think
that I didn't know you had it

50:34.100 --> 50:36.660
and you were just gonna pawn it
then you must think I was born yesterday.

50:36.700 --> 50:41.360
I'm sorry.
You are simply too much.

50:41.400 --> 50:44.560
What's that supposed to mean?

50:44.600 --> 50:48.500
Nothing at all.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
Wait!

50:53.100 --> 50:55.000
Wait a minute.

50:56.900 --> 51:00.000
Will you come back here?

51:17.300 --> 51:19.260
I'm sorry.

51:19.300 --> 51:22.560
That was unforgivable.

51:22.600 --> 51:24.360
I don't know why I said that.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.660
I had to get my ring back.

51:26.700 --> 51:28.860
You have it

51:28.900 --> 51:29.860
back.

51:29.900 --> 51:32.360
You don't understand.
My husband would kill me!

51:32.400 --> 51:34.660
They'd never understand how
I could lose something so precious.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.900
Precious, value wise?

51:37.300 --> 51:39.500
Precious, meaningful?

51:39.900 --> 51:42.000
It's very valuable.

51:43.300 --> 51:45.500
Meaningful?

51:47.400 --> 51:49.400
Not so much.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.060
I'm sorry.
Would you like one?

52:06.100 --> 52:10.068
Sure. It's been a long day.

52:12.300 --> 52:14.420
How many…?

52:14.460 --> 52:17.104
No shoptalk allowed.

52:18.600 --> 52:20.560
Ms. White

52:20.600 --> 52:25.165
I… It's Rebecca.

52:27.600 --> 52:30.160
And I'll pay you, of course

52:30.200 --> 52:33.438
but I just came back
to get my ring.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.525
No,

52:37.565 --> 52:39.060
you didn't.

52:39.100 --> 52:41.430
Oh, yes, I did, actually.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.100
Do you ever

52:47.100 --> 52:50.500
just stop
and let things

52:50.600 --> 52:53.200
play themselves out?

52:53.700 --> 52:56.788
No, I don't.

53:05.400 --> 53:09.500
Why do you think I'm here?

53:12.300 --> 53:14.000
Nothing

53:14.200 --> 53:16.560
is going to happen

53:16.600 --> 53:21.000
that you don't want.

53:21.500 --> 53:28.460
But, unless you tell me otherwise,

53:28.500 --> 53:34.760
I'm going to kiss you, Rebecca.

53:34.800 --> 53:38.300
That's all.

54:14.500 --> 54:16.400
I'm sorry.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.200
I can't.

54:36.700 --> 54:41.400
You said he signed this all over to you
because of the internal investigation.

54:41.500 --> 54:44.960
REBECCA: He is trying to make sure that
if Westridge Amalgamated

54:45.000 --> 54:48.841
has to file bankruptcy,
that Westridge United

54:48.900 --> 54:51.060
won't be affected.

54:51.100 --> 54:53.460
If we proceed with this plan,

54:53.500 --> 54:55.960
you do understand
what you are about to do?

54:56.000 --> 54:56.860
Yes.

54:56.900 --> 54:59.160
You will own the voting stock

54:59.200 --> 55:03.069
with monetary value
from Westridge United.

55:03.109 --> 55:06.160
He must trust the shit out of you.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.060
Yes.

55:08.100 --> 55:11.460
He does.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.760
But he'll still be able to be CEO

55:13.800 --> 55:16.560
and maintain his current lifestyle, right?

55:16.600 --> 55:18.060
For the most part.

55:18.100 --> 55:24.560
But as for the rest of the estate
the lion's share of it will be yours

55:24.600 --> 55:27.460
and it will render him…

55:27.500 --> 55:31.500
well, impotent.

55:33.200 --> 55:37.560
Since we have exhausted all
avenues of treatment,

55:37.600 --> 55:40.660
I think it's time
you tell your family and your loved ones.

55:40.700 --> 55:43.060
Once you reach
a certain progression

55:43.100 --> 55:46.560
the symptoms are gonna come on faster.

55:46.600 --> 55:50.860
They're gonna need to be prepared
and as the end grows nearer

55:50.900 --> 55:52.160
you're gonna need help.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.660
I promise I will do everything I can
to keep you as pain-free

55:55.700 --> 56:00.500
and to make this as tolerable
as something like this can be.

57:55.800 --> 57:59.260
I guess dad didn't really
answer the question, did he?

57:59.300 --> 58:01.660
But the only one
who can answer it, is you.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.360
- Is it worth it to you?
- Yeah, of course it is.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.810
What about Emily?

58:08.850 --> 58:11.260
You're not in love
with Janice, not like that.

58:11.300 --> 58:17.460
Emily and you are made
for each other, and Janice, she is…

58:17.500 --> 58:21.417
Hey, we have a lot in common.

58:22.100 --> 58:28.600
The only thing you two have in common
is third generation, over indulged wealth.

58:31.400 --> 58:34.560
You don't belong in suits and ties, Ace.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.260
You belong in flip flops and

58:36.300 --> 58:40.500
raggedy ass T-shirts
with really dorky slogans.

58:45.700 --> 58:48.700
So don't do it
unless you're absolutely sure.

58:50.200 --> 58:53.000
It is for the rest of your life.

58:54.400 --> 58:59.000
I just want you to be happy,
that's all.

59:00.500 --> 59:03.619
Just remember it's not too late.

59:11.700 --> 59:15.800
I've got to say, Rebecca,
you've got some balls.

59:16.600 --> 59:22.000
And I mean, some cast-iron,
rock-solid balls, lady.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.000
[Elevator bell - "door is open"]

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.700
I…

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.200
am at your disposal.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.700
- Where is she already?
- Right.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.700
I don't know.
For mom to miss dinner?

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.000
Especially this one.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.194
Did I hear my name?

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.860
Oh!

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.300
You're not ready.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:43.000
Janice, I'm so sorry, honey.
Something came up.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:55.985
Order pizza, and I'll see you all
in a couple of hours.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.360
And Janice, tomorrow night
I'll… sitting arrangements.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.760
I'm, sorry.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.000
Promise.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.400
Tomorrow. Have fun.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.360
Seriously?

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:15.060
Yeah, she knows that
I don't do fake food.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.260
Whatever.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.760
Aaron, I'm gonna need you to call
"Chez sous les meilleurs", okay?

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:22.399
Maybe we could just get pizza?

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.700
I'm all for pizza.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.960

for your own good.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.060
I don't want it to stop.

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.960
I know you don't.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.960
But I have seen so many girls
go down this track, fall for Johns.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.900
It's not like that.

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.460
It's never like that.

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:54.360
But it never ends well.

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:59.160
I have to. I'm sorry.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.300
I'm sorry.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.600
I've got your back, kid.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.275
Bloody hell, girls.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.660
This artwork that you do, Paris,
seriously, it's amazing.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:17.760
Was this what you were used to do?

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.160
It's a hobby.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.660
I love this.
It's so cute.

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.660
Honey, this is not a hobby.

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:28.660
You are extremely talented.
I'm not kidding.

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.460
Tell me.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.660
Well, the point is…

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.487
sort of besides the point…

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:45.222
In and of itself…

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.841
What does any of them really mean?

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.844
Nothing.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.235
But when you put one here,

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.960
and here,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.760
and here,

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:10.460
all of these funny,
random, seemingly,

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.960
as in life, disjointed pieces,

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.500
somehow they all
magically come together.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:25.160
Every speck,

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.341
every part…

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:37.760
it all comes together

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.500
to create the whole picture.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:10.760
I was instructed to give you this
after the funeral.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.660
I'm so sorry.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.840
Who are you?

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.960
I have to tell you.
In all my years

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.928
I have never
been stumped by a client.

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.100
Not once.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:37.760
Until now. Okay.
So here's the truth:

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.960
I watch a lot
of soap operas.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.960
So when I got your call,
at first I thought:

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.960
"Oh, that had to be
Mrs. White's evil twin".

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.260
Or you were going to blackmail Valentina,
which I do not recommend,

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:56.476
because that gal
is one crazy bitch.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.560
My favorite:
you are actually looking for

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.025
a ticket on Valentina's
gravy train yourself.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.555
No.

01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.767
Thank you.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.636
I needed that.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:30.442
And thank you
for meeting with me.

01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.000
What can I do for you?

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.017
When the time comes,
I'd like you to give this to Paris.

01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:42.160
It's a gift.
She'll know what it means.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.700
But you see her almost every day,
why don't you just give it to her?

01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:47.860
No, I…

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.060
I have not been able to see
Paris for the last few days.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:58.560
Ohh, lovers quarrel. Sorry.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.960
You know, would you mind
losing the shades?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.487
I can't see you.
It drives me nuts.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.500
- You really tied one on last night.
- This is important.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.900
I want her to get out.

01:35:23.894 --> 01:35:30.460
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe we do this because we like it?

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:35.300
That we are proud of our trade,
that we've had opportunities?

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:38.500
You, yes.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.000
But not Paris.

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:46.728
You really care about her,
don't you?

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.940
I'm in love with her.

01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:04.860
Yes, you are.

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:12.028
But I hate to tell you,
you're not gonna be the last.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:18.507
I need to be her last… client.

01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.392
She trusts you, Sylvie.

01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.280
She relies on you,
I know that.

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.715
I'm not gonna be
seeing Paris again.

01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:33.084
So, your husband found out, hm?

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.285
You want soap opera?

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.933
I'm dying.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:50.052
Cancer.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.060
I don't have
a lot of time left and

01:36:55.100 --> 01:37:00.400
I'm beginning to have some
severe physical symptoms.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.300
I don't want Paris
to see me like this.

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.260
I want her to remember me…

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:10.951
Of course you do.

01:37:10.991 --> 01:37:12.573
…remember the good stuff.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:15.958
Okay, listen to me.

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.300
You have got to say goodbye to her.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.460
You have to.

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.460
You know that.

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:26.953
Look, you're scared.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.604
You can't just disappear.

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.860
And I don't want you to worry

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.860
not about Paris, because
I'm gonna pick her back up.

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:40.860
I'm gonna put her
in my back pocket.

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:43.460
Okay? I'm gonna take care of Paris,

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:45.460
but you have to tell her.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.600
And not just for her.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.300
For you.

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.760
For you.

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:59.115
So, as we say in the trade,

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.200
"women up".

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.600
I need to say goodbye.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.460
What's going on?

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.860
I love you so much.

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:26.460
We really want this.

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.160
Oh, I want this.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:32.360
I've wanted this my whole life.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:35.200
And you gave it to me.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:21.000
[Church bell]

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.100
Hi, sweetie.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.700
You okay?

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.416
We'll see you at the house.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:52.360
Your mother retained me to work
for you as long as you need me.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.000
Oh, what's this?

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.562
Your mother revised her will.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.460
She was very busy
her last few months.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.905
This will all become clear to you
when you're able to read through it.

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:10.360
- You guys all right?
- Yeah. We're all right.

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.579
She wanted to make sure that
there wasn't anything that you needed.

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:21.460
She was pretty certain
there would be some

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:25.100
harsh feelings
among the ranks.

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.260
So she retained me

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.700
to protect your interests.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.660
If it makes any difference,
I have never met a woman

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:41.160
with more character
than your mother.

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:44.369
My sincerest condolences.

01:42:57.300 --> 01:42:59.734
Are you okay?

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.393
I'll see you at home, okay?

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.900
"My dear Jessica,"

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.660
My dear Jessica,

01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:33.800
I know this can't erase the past
but it will protect your future.

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:36.660
When your dad signed
his assets over to me

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:38.960
I decided to reconstruct my will

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.560
so that all three
of my children would be equal

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.000
and all sharing your futures
as true brothers and sisters.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.060
So what I couldn't do
in my lifetime,

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:53.900
I've done now.
Protected you.

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.760
Just know

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.800
I am with you.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.660
I love you,

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.000
mom.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:45:00.000
[Soft piano music]

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.435
Oh, my god.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.800
Excuse me.

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:51.500
Excuse me,
Ms. Scofield?

01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.800
You're the artist, right?
Hi.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.960
Yeah?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.660
Do I know you?

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.860
No.

01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:06.016
But you knew my mother.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:14.260
And

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:24.000
I want to know…

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.760
I want to know about my mom.

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:25.660
Okay.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:30.060
See, I feel like I've known her
in a very black and white way.

01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:33.560
And I want to know
who she became

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.600
in the end.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And now for Miss Scofield's
center piece…

01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:44.300
What would you like to know?

01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.000
"Une petite mort".
