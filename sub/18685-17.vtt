WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.471
SABRINA: Let's go over this one
more time just so we're clear.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.005
You're saying that
if we can knock Jimmy out...
JIMMY: Not possible.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.507
...you will eat every meal
out of a dog bowl

00:06.540 --> 00:08.542
for an entire month?
Yeah.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.378
And you have to sleep
in the yard.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.246
Not gonna sleep in the yard.
We've already been over
the terms.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.014
Now if you guys fail...
They will fail.

00:14.048 --> 00:16.317
...you have to go to bed,
lights out by 10:00

00:16.350 --> 00:18.319
every night for a month.
I'm telling you,
this cannot be done.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.554
What is in it for you?
Bragging rights.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.490
Oh, I've seen this guy
get hit in the head

00:22.523 --> 00:24.158
with a crowbar before.
You hit me in the
head with a crowbar.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.659
I hit this guy in the head
with a crowbar before,

00:25.693 --> 00:27.395
did nothing.
Ah.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.696
It's 'cause I got the
thickest skull in the league.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.099
What league?
Why don't you come find out?

00:31.132 --> 00:33.267
MICKEY: Aah!
Give me a little
kiss good night.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.502
(makes kissing sound)

00:34.535 --> 00:36.437
(Chip grunts, Mickey laughs)

00:36.470 --> 00:38.672
You see that?
(Jimmy laughs)

00:38.706 --> 00:40.508
Stings your hand a little
bit, doesn't it? Yeah.
(sighs)

00:40.541 --> 00:42.210
Night-night. Be sure
and brush your teeth. Next!

00:42.243 --> 00:44.078
Oh. Hi, sweetheart.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.214
Now, let's not
mess up a manicure.
MICKEY: Oh!

00:46.247 --> 00:48.516
(Mickey laughs)
You should be
playing soccer.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.351
I like the element
of surprise.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.553
Sweet dreams. Okay,
Ben, you're up.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.388
And I believe in you the most,
okay? Really focus.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.524
As hard as you can.
Oh... boy.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.026
Oh. Our bad.
(squeaking
exhale)

00:59.059 --> 01:01.529
Well, that's on us. That's on us
for not explaining...
(strained): Yeah.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.031
That's not your fault.
You're too young to get it.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.100
But he's not mad.
You're not mad. Okay.
Not mad at you at all.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.202
Go to your room, all right?
I'll be in to tuck you in soon.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.271
Night-night.
Good night, Ben.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.606
Yeah. Wasn't expecting that.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. Come on.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.476
Stung, yeah? Okay.
Oh, whatever.
Just... you know.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.211
Thanks for helping me
put the kids to bed.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.546
Yeah. It's been a lot of fun

01:18.579 --> 01:20.148
to be part
of a normal family again,

01:20.181 --> 01:21.782
you know, 'cause when
I was a kid, there was just...

01:21.815 --> 01:23.317
(grunts)
(shrieks)

01:23.351 --> 01:27.155
Oh, his skull
isn't that thick.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.257
You did it!
(strained): I'm fine.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.658
BOTH:
Oh!

01:30.691 --> 01:32.226
Oh!
Undefeated.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.762
Okay, you got me.
(laughs)

01:34.795 --> 01:37.165
Oh, that's a fun game.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.732
(crickets chirping)

01:38.766 --> 01:41.435
(door opens, clattering)

01:44.104 --> 01:46.474
(thudding, glass clinks)

01:48.442 --> 01:50.778
(papers rustling)

01:53.681 --> 01:55.483
(papers rustling)

01:55.516 --> 01:57.851
(whispers):
Oh!

02:00.388 --> 02:02.623
Oh, God, we're being robbed.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.209
(gun chamber clicks)
Freeze!

02:21.242 --> 02:23.377
Okay, just take it easy.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.112
Now put your hands up.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.515
Up!
They're up!

02:28.716 --> 02:31.319
Now say good night.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.457
(groaning)
Holy crap, I got him!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.526
Guys! Come quick!
I got him!
(groaning)

02:38.559 --> 02:40.794
What the hell is going on?
Chip, are you okay?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.796
(groaning)
I saw a burglar.
I didn't

02:42.830 --> 02:45.132
know what to do...
so I smoked his ass!

02:45.165 --> 02:46.500
All right.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.836
Yes. Hello?
Somebody's been shot.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.305
Uh, 2400 Radcliffe Drive. It's
the corner of Tidewind and...

02:51.339 --> 02:52.640
You shot me!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.675
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

02:54.708 --> 02:56.510
Father?
Christopher?
Daddy?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.812
Uh, never mind. I was
just kidding. Sorry.
Guns are bad. Bye!

02:58.846 --> 03:00.548
Don't shoot!

03:00.581 --> 03:02.416
Mommy?!
Mom?
Poodle?

03:02.450 --> 03:05.152
Chip shot me!
My own son shot me!
I didn't mean to!

03:05.185 --> 03:07.255
Oh, my God. I was being brave!
Oh, my God, I shot my daddy!

03:07.288 --> 03:09.323
It's all right. The gunpowder's,
like, a hundred years old.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.158
It probably just broke the skin.
Mommy's alive!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.393
Yeah. Okay, not so tight, honey.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.194
What the hell's
going on?!
Why...?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.597
Everyone just be quiet, okay?
The cops are on their way,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.832
so unless you want to go
to jail, just listen to me.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.201
Chip, take your brother to his
room. Alba, why don't you go

03:21.235 --> 03:23.604
hide Christopher and Poodle?
Oh, okay. Poodle.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.172
What about
the police?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.207
They're expecting
a gunshot victim.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.209
And we're gonna give 'em one.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.178
(panting)

03:31.211 --> 03:32.713
So, are you gonna
do this, or what?

03:32.746 --> 03:35.349
Yeah, I just... I... It's hard
to shoot a man in the back.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.450
I've been taught
better than that.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.185
Mickey?
Huh?
This man...

03:38.218 --> 03:39.620
hit you. Whoa!
Aah.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.356
He hit you with a car.
I know, and he felt so bad.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.625
He did it twice.
He did, didn't he?
Yeah.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.726
You know what? I'll
shoot him in the butt.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.860
He'll think that's funny.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.929
Nice.
Okay. Sorry, Jimbo.

03:48.962 --> 03:53.233
(screaming)

03:53.267 --> 03:55.202
Oh!
I know. I know,
I know. I know.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.371
I'm right here. I'm right here.
Hey, shh!
(gasping)

03:57.405 --> 03:58.706
Oh, Mick.
I know.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.874
Listen, pay attention.
Chris and Poodle are home, okay?

04:00.908 --> 04:02.376
The cops are on their way,

04:02.410 --> 04:03.644
and they're expecting
a gunshot victim.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.313
So you shot me in the ass?!

04:05.346 --> 04:06.647
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, listen,
'cause you're gonna tell them

04:06.680 --> 04:09.383
that Chip shot you
by accident.
Yeah, oops!

04:09.417 --> 04:11.552
The hell I am!
Huh?
What's in it for me?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.220
(distant sirens wailing)
Well, what do you want?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.589
Um, I want to put a label
on our relationship.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.224
SABRINA:
Oh, come on!

04:17.257 --> 04:21.495
Oh. Well, that's like
a whole other conversation.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.565
You just shot me!
I know. Literally, anything else
I'll give you, okay?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.500
You guys, we got to
move this along, okay?

04:26.534 --> 04:27.835
Okay, okay.
All right, fine! Okay.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.237
Uh, then I want... Oh.
I want a pillow.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.406
(sirens)
You want a pillow?
I want a pillow

04:32.440 --> 04:34.475
'cause I'm sick of sleeping
on a rolled up towel.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.976
Okay, you got it.
I'll get you a pillow.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.446
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Okay.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.648
JIMMY:
Oh, it really burns
when I breathe.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.249
Mm-hmm.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.317
You're lucky no
one was killed.

04:43.351 --> 04:46.587
Yeah.
Oh. Big time. Yup.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.489
Guns are very dangerous, son.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.823
Yeah. Thank you, Officer.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.359
We are so, so
sorry about this.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.326
Okay.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.661
Thank you.
All right.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.496
Good night.
Yeah.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.699
All right,
coast is clear.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.606
(sighs)
So...
(laughs)

05:05.639 --> 05:07.608
You all look well.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.942
What the hell is going on?
Where the hell
have you been?!

05:08.976 --> 05:10.277
Why didn't
you call?!

05:10.310 --> 05:13.981
(overlapping chatter)
Okay, okay, shh, shh!

05:14.014 --> 05:16.550
I just... I haven't
seen you all in months,

05:16.584 --> 05:19.620
and I would love to just... sit
down like a civilized family...

05:19.653 --> 05:21.955
Mm-hmm.
...and we'll explain everything.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.292
Okay? Alba, whip up
some food, please.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.994
Oh.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.496
Hey, here's the thing.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.030
Alba doesn't really
do that anymore.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.332
Do what?
Freakin' anything!

05:32.366 --> 05:33.734
She just loafs around
like she's part of the family.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.569
Well, it's up to you.

05:35.603 --> 05:39.339
Do your job,
or there's the door.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.911
CHRISTOPHER:
Grab a Bordeaux

05:43.944 --> 05:45.646
from the cellar
while you're at it.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.048
Oh, yeah, here's the thing
about the Bordeaux.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.384
I drank it.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.660
You really had to force her
to wear her uniform?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.695
I didn't force her
to do anything. She likes it.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.330
Alba, could I get
another piece

06:03.363 --> 06:04.532
of that delicious...?
POODLE:
Uh-uh, do not

06:04.565 --> 06:05.999
feed him anything else.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.768
I swear your father's
the only man in history

06:07.801 --> 06:10.003
to gain weight on the run.
(laughs)

06:10.037 --> 06:11.672
Speaking of the run, why
don't you skip to the part

06:11.705 --> 06:13.373
where you
Jason Bourne'd your way back

06:13.407 --> 06:14.842
into your own home in
middle of the night?

06:14.875 --> 06:19.012
Yes, as I was saying,
so we were laying low

06:19.046 --> 06:22.349
in this hotel in Montreal,
which I would not recommend.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.518
And then we came home one day

06:24.552 --> 06:26.554
to find the lobby
crawling with cops.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.356
I suspect they tracked
your mother's shrill voice.
Okay.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.060
Fascinating. Well, while you
two were vacationing in Canada,

06:33.093 --> 06:35.062
I've been here guarding
the gates of hell.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.865
Oh, you poor thing.
I'm so sorry

06:37.898 --> 06:39.700
that you had
to keep our mansion warm

06:39.733 --> 06:41.401
while we were living
out of a suitcase

06:41.435 --> 06:43.370
like a couple of filthy...
Criminals?

06:43.403 --> 06:46.039
No. I think that's the pot
calling the kettle black.
Oh, is it?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.741
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Sorry. What
would you call it?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.910
Uh, I don't know.
Wrongfully accused?

06:49.943 --> 06:52.379
(laughs)
Yeah, that's right.
We're innocent.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.748
Uh-huh.
And we have files
in this house to prove it.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.050
I knew it!
I told you guys!

06:57.084 --> 06:59.052
Look, I tried to tell them,

06:59.086 --> 07:01.555
but they're just a
bunch of stupid idiots.
SABRINA: Hey, Chip,

07:01.589 --> 07:03.090
how do you think the
police found them?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.559
We're past that.
What's more important is

07:05.593 --> 07:07.561
they're home, and they're safe.
MICKEY:
Mm.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.663
So, do this mean
they're home for good?

07:09.697 --> 07:14.101
Well, there's a long road ahead
to clear our name, but, yes,

07:14.134 --> 07:15.503
I suppose it does.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.971
Ben, honey, stop picking

07:18.005 --> 07:19.740
at your face.
You're grossing Mommy out.
Mm.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.409
It's a nervous thing. He does it
when he's feeling overwhelmed.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.844
Here, you go, buddy.
POODLE: What? That's...

07:23.877 --> 07:25.412
Stare at the flame.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.847
He loves the flame.
POODLE:
Wow.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.749
That's great.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.852
And why is he wearing
my cashmere turtleneck?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.421
'Cause I let him wear
whatever he wants.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.756
Terrific parenting, Mackenzie.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.158
I leave behind
a sweet son,

07:38.191 --> 07:39.760
and I come back
to a pyromaniac daughter.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.029
Any other fun surprises,
by the way?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.631
Piercings? Tattoos?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.033
MICKEY: I'm sorry,
you didn't exactly

07:46.066 --> 07:47.668
leave me with an
instruction manual.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.769
As if you would've read it.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.170
At least she's been here.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.872
Ugh, my God, I was here

07:51.905 --> 07:53.440
for 17 years, Sabrina.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.175
I'm sorry if I
missed a few months.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.945
Don't beat yourself up. They'll
probably stay kids forever.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.448
You know what,
it has been a really long day.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.950
And if you guys
are all done

08:02.983 --> 08:04.552
criticizing me,

08:04.585 --> 08:06.687
I think I'm gonna
head on up to bed, okay?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.956
We can finish this up tomorrow.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.190
Sound good?

08:10.223 --> 08:12.660
I think that sounds good.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.500
Where's the butter?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.870
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

08:26.506 --> 08:28.576
What the...

08:28.609 --> 08:29.643
Good morning.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.479
Wh-Why am I cuffed?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.981
I'm the victim.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.016
You also have several
outstanding warrants.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.819
Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.488
Okay, you know, I-I'm not
even gonna dignify New Hampshire

08:41.521 --> 08:42.756
with a response.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.992
The judge is
a straight-up racist.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.828
Says here you urinated in public
and failed to appear in court.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.496
What?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.031
Oh.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.233
Yeah. Well, that New Hampshire.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.670
That was... I get mixed up,
'cause there's...
Mm-hmm.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.839
What am I looking at here?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.507
I'd say at least 30 days.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
Did you say "13" or "30"?

09:02.576 --> 09:03.844
I said "30."

09:03.877 --> 09:05.879
Oh, come on.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.681
I'll do community service.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.950
You want me to do the jobs
no one else wants?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.753
I'll run the furnace
at the dog shelter.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.525
Okay.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.529
How 'bout, uh,
I catch you a marlin

09:22.562 --> 09:25.833
so you can throw this little
guppy back in the kiddie pool.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.704
Look, moron, I don't know
what the hell that means.

09:30.738 --> 09:36.076
I can get you
Chris and Pamela Pemberton.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.547
Don't know who that is.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.716
They're a big deal.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.985
They're known fugitives, okay?

09:45.018 --> 09:48.588
Do you read the pap... Why am I
even talking to you, all right?

09:48.622 --> 09:51.892
Call somebody with some proper
clearances. They'll know.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.927
I am done with you.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.665
Oh.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.167
Hey. What's going on?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.569
Well, unfortunately,
our room looks like you hosted

10:02.602 --> 10:04.738
a bum fight in it.
Yeah.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.774
You can thank
your psychotic kids for that.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.642
Can we, uh, pick this
up tomorrow? I was shot,

10:08.676 --> 10:10.577
so... pretty tired.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.114
Yeah. Yeah, I bet. It's just...
that this is my room, so...

10:14.147 --> 10:15.649
Actually, it's my room.

10:15.683 --> 10:19.286
Yeah. They're
all my rooms.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.089
Is this about the kids
sticking up for me?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.157
Because I'm sure
they didn't mean anything...
No. No, no.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.693
It has nothing to do with that.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.629
Okay? Now please leave.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.702
(car engine revving,
tires screeching on TV)

10:34.735 --> 10:35.936
(man shouting on TV)

10:35.969 --> 10:37.170
(changing TV channels)

10:37.204 --> 10:39.840
Hey. How come you guys are up?

10:39.873 --> 10:43.944
Not tired.
Yeah, I'm still a little charged
up from shooting my father.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.045
Yeah. I'll bet.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.647
(sighs)

10:47.681 --> 10:50.984
Listen, I wanted to thank you
guys for having my back earlier.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.652
That meant a lot.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.187
That had nothing
to do with you.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.890
I was just trying
to hurt them.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.892
Oh.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.360
Yeah.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.262
Yeah, obviously.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.198
It's kind of crazy,

11:05.232 --> 11:06.633
what's going on
with your parents, huh?

11:06.666 --> 11:07.968
If you guys want
to talk about it,

11:08.001 --> 11:09.336
I just want you to know
I'm here.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.038
No, I'm good. Thanks.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.140
CHIP: Yeah, hard part's
over. Now that Mom and Dad

11:13.173 --> 11:15.709
are back, things can finally go
back to the way they were.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.878
You know,
before you showed up.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.247
Yeah. I get it.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.718
Okay.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.653
I'll just go.

11:26.686 --> 11:30.157
I'm just gonna...

11:30.190 --> 11:33.693
just gonna go.
(chuckles)

11:33.727 --> 11:35.662
(audience laughter on TV)

11:35.695 --> 11:36.997
Okay, Mommy's tired,
all right.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.667
Just go to sleep and I'll
answer in the morning, okay?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.903
Oh. Hey.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.171
Didn't know you
were in here.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.773
I just came to tuck Ben in.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.374
Oh. Well, that's
very thoughtful of you,

11:47.407 --> 11:49.276
but I think I can manage.
Yeah.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.078
Yeah, of course. You should
know though that there's,

11:51.111 --> 11:52.780
like, a whole routine now.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.048
Starts by killing all
the monsters in the closet.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.117
Well, that is
the obvious first step.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.852
And I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about,

11:58.886 --> 12:00.187
but it-it doesn't hurt to check.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.221
Am I right, Ben?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.723
Oh!

12:03.757 --> 12:05.192
Oh, Ben!

12:05.225 --> 12:07.227
A huge monster! What do I do?!

12:07.260 --> 12:09.196
Rip their filthy guts out!

12:09.229 --> 12:12.065
Get out of Ben's... Oh! Oh, no.
Kill him! Slit his throat!

12:12.099 --> 12:14.067
Get him! Kill him!

12:14.101 --> 12:16.870
Rip his eyes out!
I'm killing the monster!

12:16.904 --> 12:18.238
Get him! Hit him in the face!
Okay, that'll do. That...

12:18.271 --> 12:21.308
So much fun! That'll do.
(grunting)

12:21.341 --> 12:23.376
Okay, can I talk to you
for a second? Yeah?
Yeah.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.711
You're all set. Sweet dreams.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.913
Night-night.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.749
Back off.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.085
My kid. My bedroom.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.286
My maid.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.288
My everything. Understand?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.757
Are you serious?
Do you have any idea

12:37.791 --> 12:39.226
what these kids
have put me through?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.962
Plus, you haven't paid me yet,
by the way.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.430
Oh. Okay.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.232
Is that what this is about?
Fine.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.335
All right, um, how much do
you want for being their aunt?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.904
Do you mean, how much do you owe
me for everything I've done?

12:50.938 --> 12:53.273
'Cause I don't think I could put
a price tag on all of it.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.241
How does $30,000 sound?

12:54.274 --> 12:57.410
F-Fine. Fine. That's fair.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.913
Sounds super fair. Yeah.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.448
You said "30" though,
not "13," right?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.917
'Cause "30" is what I heard.
And so that's binding.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.752
Okay. Here you go.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.254
You got everything
you wanted.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
You happy?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.831
Mr. Shepherd.
I am Detective Hurley.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.367
I hear you have information
on the Pembertons.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.302
Okay, hold your horses, Serpico.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.105
I might. I might not.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.941
What do you want?
For starters, I don't want
to do any time.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.177
We can do that.
Start talking.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.112
I'm not finished.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.214
I also want to throw out

13:34.247 --> 13:36.016
the first pitch
at Fenway next season.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.219
(chuckles) I want a wife that
doesn't laugh when I cry.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.520
Think smaller.

13:40.553 --> 13:41.521
Fine.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.523
I want a hamburger.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.492
The food here sucks.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.228
Get this idiot a hamburger,
okay?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.230
Not just any burger.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.300
One from Randy's
over on North Street.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.069
And a piece of pie.
They don't have pie.

13:56.103 --> 13:59.139
Well, looks like you're gonna be
making two stops then.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.508
Get the pie.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.811
(door opens)

14:04.844 --> 14:06.313
There you are.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.181
Okay, what is the plan?

14:08.215 --> 14:09.482
What plan?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.418
You know, to get rid
of Christopher and Poodle.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.520
Eh? Are we gonna drug 'em?
Throw 'em on a train?

14:13.553 --> 14:14.387
What's that?

14:14.421 --> 14:15.822
Oh. Chloroform.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.191
I, uh, found a recipe online.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.228
No. Nobody's drugging
anybody. I'm leaving.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.563
Well, where are you going?

14:23.596 --> 14:25.432
I don't know, man. That's
the great thing about freedom.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.401
You just kind of roam around,
do whatever you want.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.503
Oh, how easy for you.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.274
All right, run away,
little muskrat.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.842
What are you doing?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.545
I'm not doing anything.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.547
You just soaked that rag
in chloroform.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.349
No, I didn't.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.883
Alba, don't come at me
with that.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.352
What? I'm not even moving.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.453
You are literally walking
towards me.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.455
You brought this on yourself.
No. Hey, hey, hey!

14:48.488 --> 14:50.924
Come here!
Just take it!
(grunting)

14:50.958 --> 14:54.094
Just take it!
Come on!
Let go!

14:54.127 --> 14:56.429
Go to sleep!
Alba, get off of me! Stop!

14:56.463 --> 14:58.298
Oh! Oh!

14:58.331 --> 15:00.433
Oh! Come on!

15:00.467 --> 15:02.569
You know how long
it took me to make that?

15:02.602 --> 15:04.204
Well, what is your
endgame here?

15:04.237 --> 15:05.872
You gonna chloroform
me every day?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.607
I was gonna do
whatever it takes.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.410
I'm not a quitter.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.913
See you around,
muskrat.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.584
(sighs)

15:30.463 --> 15:33.466
I'll see you around, pal.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.609
All right, enough.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.178
We got you the food
and the beer,

15:45.212 --> 15:47.414
the Wu-Tang headband.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.316
It's time to start talking.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.919
Guys, I want to tell you,
I really do,

15:52.952 --> 15:55.655
but first there's something
I'm gonna need.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.257
No.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.325
No more.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.993
Last one.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.029
Then you're gonna sing?

16:02.062 --> 16:04.531
Oh, like Ariana Grande.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.168
All right. What is it?

16:08.201 --> 16:13.006
I want a picture of Officer
Strassner's wife in a bikini.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.374
You trying to be cute?

16:14.407 --> 16:15.942
Oh, you lay a hand on me

16:15.975 --> 16:17.544
and I will sue
the whole department.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.982
So what's it gonna be, boys?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.122
(gasps)
Nothing. What are you....
Mackenzie.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.157
Hey.
What are you doing?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.624
What?
Oh, we're just, uh,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.460
going to meet with our lawyer.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.694
Yes...

16:34.727 --> 16:36.463
Oh, my God, you guys
are bailing again.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.531
(loud metal clattering)
I thought you were innocent.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.067
Ugh, don't be an idiot.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.135
Innocent people don't sneak in
and out of their own houses.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.970
We needed cash,
we're splitting up.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.238
Where are you going?
I'm going to Cuba.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.973
Poodle's going to hell.
Uh, well...

16:47.006 --> 16:49.142
That's why you wrote me that
check? So you could dump

16:49.176 --> 16:51.010
your kids on me again.
They're gonna be okay.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.645
I made sure they have enough
money for three lifetimes.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.147
No. That's-that's not enough,
Christopher.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.682
And let me tell you something
about your kids,

16:55.715 --> 16:58.051
they are wonderful.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.519
Mm.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.321
That might be a bit
of an exaggeration.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.655
They're kind of a nightmare
most of the time,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.157
but they've got you two
as parents,

17:04.191 --> 17:06.159
so I would say they
are doing an amazing job.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.495
Well, if you love them so much,
then why don't you take them?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.163
What?

17:10.197 --> 17:11.431
Wrap it up, Poodle.
Yeah, take them.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.665
I can't just take your children.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.101
It doesn't work like that.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.535
How about a million dollars?

17:16.769 --> 17:19.672
I can certainly give it
a-a good try.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.674
Yeah. I'm sure you can.
I will give it my best shot.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.009
(pounding on door)
MAN: Open up. FBI.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.277
Oh, my God.
How did they find us?

17:24.311 --> 17:26.079
ALBA:
I called them. Me.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.347
Alba.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.681
We know you're in there!
You what? Why?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.618
(pounding on door continues)
Why? (chuckles)

17:31.651 --> 17:34.020
He wants to know why, Mickey.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.422
'Cause I don't like
you, that's why.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.623
This house

17:36.656 --> 17:38.125
belongs to Mickey
and me now.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.026
We got plans, big plans.
What? What? Alba.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.628
And they don't include
you pe... What?
Alba!

17:41.661 --> 17:43.163
They were already leaving.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.534
Well, I did not know that.
(pounding on door continues)

17:47.567 --> 17:50.036
Federal officers!
(doorbell ringing)
You are so fired, Alba.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.139
You pack your crap,
Poodle, we have to go.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.273
and get the hell
out of our house.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.774
I brought you here
and I can send you back!

17:54.807 --> 17:56.476
Okay. Let's go.
Let's go, come on.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.145
This is your last warning!
We will break this door down!

18:02.815 --> 18:05.252
Oh, yeah. That is a ride
I would not get off.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.087
But I was very clear
about the bikini part.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.622
That is a bikini.
That's mesh.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.090
You can see right through it.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.760
If it's attached
it's a one-piece.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.628
This is Hurley.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.264
Look at that tan.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.798
Right now. Thank you.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.467
The Pembertons
are at their house.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.068
What?
I got to run.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.470
No. Whoa, whoa, whoa-- hey!

18:23.503 --> 18:24.737
Hurley, hang on.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.406
Hey. That's my tip.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.107
I was about to tell
you that, all right?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.110
All right. So I guess
we're done, so...

18:31.144 --> 18:32.745
No. That's mine.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.447
I earned that.
I earned that, all right?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.782
So just gi...
What are you doing?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.484
Where are you go...

18:37.517 --> 18:39.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. What's he do...

18:39.619 --> 18:40.620
What wa...

18:40.653 --> 18:42.289
Oh, what are you doing?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.257
No, please don't... (groans)
(defibrillator beeps)

18:44.291 --> 18:46.326
Okay, the road's that way.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.628
Yeah, and the harbor's
that way.
What?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.663
You just want to go that way
because it's downhill.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.665
Hey. I got shot,
you sour bitch.
(groans)

18:52.699 --> 18:55.101
You know what?
I am done.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.269
Here. Take your share.
Wh... Hey.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.370
I'd rather get mowed down

18:57.404 --> 18:58.671
in a hellfire of bullets

18:58.705 --> 19:00.473
than listen to
your constant shrieks.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.175
Well, you certainly have
the padding for it.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.476
You peaked 20 years ago.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.677
(dogs barking in distance)

19:04.711 --> 19:06.479
Chip's not yours.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.315
What?
(dogs barking, men shouting)

19:08.348 --> 19:10.116
Yeah.
What?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.484
You heard me.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.785
Oh, God!
(barking, growling)

19:12.819 --> 19:14.221
(yelling)

19:14.254 --> 19:16.389
(screams)

19:16.423 --> 19:17.524
(barking, screaming)

19:17.557 --> 19:19.626
You're under arrest!
FBI! Stand down!

19:19.659 --> 19:21.528
Stop resisting!

19:25.665 --> 19:28.167
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

19:32.372 --> 19:35.708
Okay... okay.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.512
The thing to remember

19:39.546 --> 19:41.648
is that your
parents love you.
Mm. Yes.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.316
They-they mentioned that,
and they also-- weren't they

19:43.350 --> 19:44.584
talking about how
proud they were

19:44.617 --> 19:46.152
of-of all of your...
ALBA: Yeah.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.687
Lots of stuff.
uh...

19:47.720 --> 19:50.357
uh, accomplishments, uh...

19:50.390 --> 19:52.659
You don't have to lie.
We heard you guys.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.594
You did?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.363
You were speaking
at full volume.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.398
(groans)

19:58.431 --> 20:00.199
Uh...

20:01.534 --> 20:04.237
Okay.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.838
Well, for what it's
worth, you know...

20:05.872 --> 20:07.840
Oh, whoa. What are you doing?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.243
Are you serious?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.512
I was gonna hug you.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.748
Oh.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.385
Well, no.
I don't want to do it anymore.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.186
Well, how was I supposed to know
you were gonna hug me?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.688
I didn't even know
you knew how to hug.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.356
It was obvious that that's what
I was gonna do, Mickey.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.624
I thought you were coming at me.
Just forget it, okay?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.293
The moment's passed.
Okay, I'm sorry.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.361
Just forget about it.
I don't want to do it anymore.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.462
Okay, okay, okay. We'll try it
tomorrow, we'll try it tomorrow.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.398
We're never gonna try it again.

20:31.431 --> 20:35.368
Okay. Um, I got to go tell
your brother.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.403
We'll come with you.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.739
(sighs)
O-Okay.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.412
(gasps)
Holy crap!

20:45.445 --> 20:47.380
CHIP: What did you do?
Fire's neat.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.815
No! Hey, come on.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.917
Go! Get out of here.
(indistinct shouting)

20:55.254 --> 20:58.224
(Mickey pants)

20:58.257 --> 20:59.959
(flames roaring,
house crumbling)

20:59.992 --> 21:02.395
It's beautiful.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.763
Okay. It's okay.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.598
No, guys. It's okay.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.501
It's okay. I have
a million doll... in...

21:08.535 --> 21:10.437
(gasps)

21:10.470 --> 21:12.439
* I'm just a

21:12.472 --> 21:13.906
* Somebody

21:13.940 --> 21:15.742
Oh, no.
* Nobody wants

21:15.775 --> 21:17.744
* Nobody wants me *

21:17.777 --> 21:19.479
(glass shatters)

21:19.512 --> 21:22.248
* Nobody wants me

21:22.281 --> 21:24.817
* Everybody that I see

21:24.851 --> 21:27.920
* Seems to have someone but me
(siren wails)

21:27.954 --> 21:31.290
* Arm in arm, they walk along

21:31.324 --> 21:34.494
* Why does life treat me
so wrong? *

21:34.527 --> 21:37.597
* Wish somebody wanted me

21:37.630 --> 21:40.833
* 'Cause I just don't
wanna be *

21:40.867 --> 21:42.835
* Another

21:42.869 --> 21:45.938
* Somebody, nobody...
