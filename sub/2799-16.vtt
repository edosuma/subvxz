00:23.500 --> 00:27.100
You know, first time I had sex was in front of a fire...

00:27.200 --> 00:29.000
on a bear skin rug.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.900
It was so romantic.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.900
Gee, and all this time...

00:37.600 --> 00:39.800
I thought you were still a virgin.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.500
Yeah, right.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.500
You only asked for my number 'cause you heard I was easy.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.800
- Oh, you found me out.
- I did.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.600
Cheers.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.800
Oh, my God!

01:32.600 --> 01:36.402
(... police)
Alert Homicide and CSI!

02:08.500 --> 02:12.103
Chimney extends about four feet from the roofline...

02:12.903 --> 02:15.107
....assuming the vic was average height...

02:15.600 --> 02:17.200
and didn't curl up...

02:18.300 --> 02:19.900
head should be right about here.

02:30.700 --> 02:31.700
Good!

02:38.200 --> 02:39.100
Okay.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.100
Whew!

03:01.900 --> 03:05.000
Smoldering flesh has the stench of burnt pork...

03:05.500 --> 03:06.400
except much worse.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.200
I smell a little decomp, but mostly the fireplace down below.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.700
The body's really positioned too far to be in that condition.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.800
Which means...
the vic was charbroiled somewhere else,

03:17.800 --> 03:21.100
tossed in the chimney, and smoked.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.200
Check out that mold.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.100
It's just eating away at the flesh.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.400
That much mold would suggest he was burned at least a few days ago.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.100
- He?
- I measured the pelvic bone--

04:08.100 --> 04:10.600
sub-pubic angle's less than 90 degrees.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.700
He's male.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.899
Any suggestions on how to proceed?

04:17.500 --> 04:18.800
Wrap and roll.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.000
Great.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.300
Okay, you get the head.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.900
- On three...
- Yeah.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.000
One, two... three.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.000
Mm! He's lighter than I expected.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.600
Most of the muscle and flesh have burned away.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.900
He's pretty well drained of fluids.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.200
He probably weighed twice as much when he was alive.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.900
Well, that would explain how the killer

04:52.900 --> 04:56.300
was able to carry him up to the roof and then foist him down the chimney.

04:57.500 --> 04:58.300
Yeah.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.800
Get him to the morgue.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.900
I started the fire and the smoke just started pouring out.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.700
And it was just the two of you in the house.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.400
Yeah.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.800
I had just gotten off work;
I came over for a night cap.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.600
So how long have you known each other?

05:14.600 --> 05:15.900
Mm... a few months.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.700
- Do you live alone?
- Yeah. Divorced.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.200
Have a son in college.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.600
Did you hear anything up on the roof in the past week or so?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.100
Well, no, I was out of town on business till yesterday.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.300
And when was the last time you used the fireplace?

05:29.300 --> 05:31.600
A few months ago... around Christmas.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.300
I mean, there was a dead man in your chimney.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.900
Didn't you notice anything when you lit the fireplace?

05:36.900 --> 05:39.100
Martin's got a rat problem.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.500
Um... the little suckers get caught in the traps,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.400
and just stink for a couple of days.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.100
We smelled something, but we figured it was...

05:47.100 --> 05:48.400
....a rat.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.200
Excuse me, Mr. Sidley?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.700
There's a ladder leaning against the side of the house...?

05:53.700 --> 05:56.200
Yeah, that's mine.
It been there since...

05:56.200 --> 05:59.000
about New Year's, when I took down the Christmas lights.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.900
I'd like to get a set of your fingerprints.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.000
I'm going to be dusting the ladder for prints.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.600
I'd like to eliminate yours.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.600
Yeah. Sure.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.700
Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside?

06:53.200 --> 06:54.800
Crispy though and through.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.300
Based on the melted fibers, he was probably wearing a polyester shirt.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.800
Well, synthetics are just plastic polymers.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.700
They melt instead of burn.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.900
- What's that?
- Oh, some sort of plastic.

07:06.900 --> 07:09.100
I found it where his shirt pocket would've been.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.900
I'm thinking maybe a credit card.

07:10.900 --> 07:14.100
Good, good. I'll work it up;
try to get an I.D.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.000
- Catherine...
- Yeah.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.500
Do you remember this Caroline Fitzgibbons case?

07:19.500 --> 07:21.300
- About a year ago?
- Of course I do, yeah.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.400
Missing person, we never found her.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.900
Yeah, she was a minor, allegedly having an affair with a Mr. Martin...

07:26.900 --> 07:29.300
- ...Sidley?
- Ugh, yeah, what a creep.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.000
She's an aspiring photographer.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.600
I recently purchased several of her self-portraits.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.900
Mr. Sidley, her father says that she was headed over here

07:35.900 --> 07:38.300
the day before yesterday, and he hasn't heard from her since.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.900
- Would you mind if we come in?
- You know, now's not a good time.

07:40.900 --> 07:44.500
So, unless you have a warrant, the answer is no.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.900
What are you guys doing here?

07:57.900 --> 08:01.200
We were hoping that you'd invite us to help out with your investigation.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.800
Invite you?!

08:02.800 --> 08:05.700
Warrick and I were looking for a missing person about a year ago,

08:05.700 --> 08:07.700
and we tried to get a warrant to seach this residence.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.300
The owner denied us access.

08:09.300 --> 08:13.200
Now that it's a crime scene, it's fair game, if you're part of the investigation.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.600
You're picking up what we're putting down.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.700
Well, I've processed room-to-room, photo-documented, sketched the layout...

08:18.700 --> 08:20.400
Feel free to dig a little deeper.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.300
I'm gonna dust the chimney for prints.

08:22.310 --> 08:24.100
I'll be on the roof for awhile.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.500
I'll take "Video Spectral Analysis" for 200, Nick.

08:38.900 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, it's a charred piece of plastic found in Chimney Guy's pocket.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.100
It may be a credit card.
I'm trying to get some I.D. off of it.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.300
That's a gym membership card.

08:49.100 --> 08:50.200
How do you know that?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.800
The logo in the corner-- it's Burt's Gym--

08:52.800 --> 08:54.500
I belong to the one on Flamingo.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.900
Oh, yeah?
You, uh... been pumping iron there, Greg?

08:57.900 --> 09:00.400
Yeah, a little, uh... Muy Thai.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.400
It's competitive kickboxing.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.000
Gotta balance weights with cardio, you know what I mean?

09:05.300 --> 09:06.800
Yeah, okay, thanks.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.200
Anyway, I'll, uh, check it.
Maybe I can get a membership name.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.100
Oh, you won't.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.000
Member names are printed in black ink.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.100
VSA only brings out the colors.

09:17.100 --> 09:20.100
All right. Maybe it'll help us clear up the photo.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.800
Nice.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.900
Well, hello, Caroline.

12:26.100 --> 12:28.300
She was, what, like 16?

12:28.700 --> 12:32.800
Isn't it a felony to purchase pornographic pictures of a minor?

12:33.600 --> 12:36.800
Well, believe it or not, exceptions are made for photographs

12:36.800 --> 12:41.400
with serious artistic or scientific merit.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.100
Oh, yeah. These look real scientific.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.200
I don't make the rules.

12:47.200 --> 12:52.000
So I found a large, diffuse pool of fluorescence here on the wood floor.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.300
It's consistent with bleach or some other cleaning compound.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.600
- Bleach on a wood floor, huh?
- Mm.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I presume you pheno'ed it?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.600
Yeah. It was negative for blood.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.500
What are you doing?

13:08.500 --> 13:12.500
I'm looking for the tiniest crack between the planks.

13:13.800 --> 13:18.500
You know, you can scrub blood off a surface, but you can't scrub beneath it.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.400
Yeah...

13:32.400 --> 13:33.800
We got blood.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.100
As I told you last year,
I knew Caroline professionally.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.200
We had coffee a couple of times.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.600
She was a promising photographer;
I'm a collector; we had a lot to talk about.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.900
How many times is "a couple of times"?

13:48.200 --> 13:51.000
I don't know, five or six times over a month or two.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.303
Were they dates?

13:52.303 --> 13:55.307
Well, we weren't having sexual relations, if that's what you're getting at.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.100
- Was she ever in your house?
- Yeah, I invited her over to see my collection.

13:59.400 --> 14:04.600
Look, I'll admit that I was attracted to her, but when she told me her real age,

14:04.600 --> 14:07.400
I told her, it was in appropriate for us to see each other.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.800
How very responsible of you.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.500
And you had that conversation how many days before she went missing?

14:13.500 --> 14:17.100
I'm sorry, but we're not here to talk about Caroline, all right?

14:17.100 --> 14:21.100
So unless you're on some kind of cold-case fishing expedition...

14:21.100 --> 14:23.300
We found an old blood pool in your living room.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.200
- You want to tell me about that?
- Don't answer that.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.300
Ms. Willows, let's get something straight.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.900
You found a body in the chimney, so you searched his house for clues,

14:30.900 --> 14:35.100
but you had no legal right to look for any evidence unrelated to this case.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.400
We were just working the scene.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.700
This piece of wood was pried from you living room.

14:46.700 --> 14:51.900
The surface was scrubbed with a cleaning agent, but we found a spot of blood...

14:51.900 --> 14:53.500
right there.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.700
You mean, you ripped up my damn floor.
What is going on here?

14:58.700 --> 15:03.400
As soon as this is over, I intend to file an emergency motion to limit the scope or your warrant.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.200
I also intend to file a motion in limine to exclude this evidence,

15:07.200 --> 15:11.100
which was illegally seized, in violation of my client's Fourth Amendment rights.

15:11.100 --> 15:15.200
This house was processed in accordance with CSI protocol, but do what you have to do.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.900
You've been coming at me since day one, and I'm starting to resent it.

15:17.900 --> 15:18.100
Martin...

15:18.100 --> 15:21.400
You have a problem with me because I appreciate younger women?

15:21.400 --> 15:24.000
I had nothing to do with that girl's disappearance.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
You want to come after me?
You're going to regret it.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.600
Your client has a bit of a temper.

15:28.600 --> 15:33.600
Well, if you don't have any questions pertaining to the dead body in his chimney, we're done here.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.700
Sit down. Please.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.800
Gentlemen, this is Nick Stokes.
He's a colleague of mine.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.400
We found identification on the decedent in the chimney.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.300
A gym card.
Actually, it was found in his pocket.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.700
The crime lab restored the charred image, but we couldn't get a name.

15:57.700 --> 16:01.800
We we're hoping you could help make a positive I.D.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.700
This belonged to the person in my chimney?

16:14.700 --> 16:17.700
Yes, sir. You recognize him?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.200
Well, this is-this is Tad.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.500
This is my son.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.600
Let me guess: he burned to death.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.600
I can't confirm C.O.D.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.500
Come on, Doc, this isn't a hard one.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.900
His bones are fractured; check out the femur.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.900
It's not uncommon to find bone fractures in fire victims.

16:50.900 --> 16:54.500
The body produces heat, causing the long bones to contract and fracture.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.000
Well, that's right, but check out the chips in the skull.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.700
Bone chipping is also a symptom of extreme heat.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.000
Very good.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.599
So, if we didn't know better, fire could be the cause of death.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.500
What are you getting at?

17:09.500 --> 17:12.900
You see the blood spot on the interior of the forehead?

17:12.900 --> 17:13.500
Y eah...

17:13.500 --> 17:17.800
As far as I know, fire can't explain a subdural hemotoma.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
No. No, it can't.

17:20.500 --> 17:25.000
Our victim suffered blunt force trauma, prior to going up in flames.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.500
How are you doing on the prints?

18:08.500 --> 18:11.400
Well, all three prints from the chimney are consistent with each other.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.200
I compared them to the homeowner's prints and his son's prints;

18:14.200 --> 18:16.600
the work card's in the system; there's no a match.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.100
I'm running the print through I-AFIS.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.200
What about the print from the chimney cap?

18:20.200 --> 18:23.200
There's not a match to the chimney prints, not a match to either Sidley.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.300
There's no hits on I-AFIS.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.800
- I'm sorry.
- Not your fault.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.600
At least you got yourself a match for the chimney prints--

18:31.600 --> 18:36.200
A Jonathan Wax, from Henderson, served four years for attempted rape.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.800
He was released six months ago.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.300
I served my time.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.000
What do you want with me now?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.800
"Attempted rape."

18:48.000 --> 18:50.100
What exactly happened?

18:50.100 --> 18:51.400
Pepper spray.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.600
That stuff really stings.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.300
Uh, what can you tell me about, um, Tad Sidley?

18:59.300 --> 19:00.600
Who?

19:04.900 --> 19:06.200
Sorry.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.900
Maybe you remember him a little more like this?

19:14.100 --> 19:15.700
Holy mother...

19:16.100 --> 19:19.400
He was murdered, set on fire, stuffed in a chimney,

19:19.500 --> 19:22.800
and the only prints on the chimney are yours.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.300
- You said the last name was Sidley?
- Uh-huh.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.500
Well, I worked a Sidley place out near Lake Mead, right?

19:28.500 --> 19:31.100
- What were you doing on the roof?
- That's what I do--

19:31.100 --> 19:33.400
Chad's Chimney Sweeps.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.800
I clean fireplaces and chimneys.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.800
I was out at that Sidley place about a month ago.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.800
You can call Chad.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.200
I remember that place.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.900
Man, that guy had one big-ass chimney.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.400
I don't suppose you saw a body while you were there?

19:51.400 --> 19:55.300
Look, I may be an ex-con, but even I would've dialed 9-1-1.

19:56.410 --> 19:57.900
Catherine.
Excuse me.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.900
I just got a call from the D.A. about you.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.700
Martin Sidley's attorney filed a motion to suppress.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.800
Oh, it's just posturing. There's no way that our search violated his rights.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.000
Fortunately, the judge agreed with you.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.400
- Good.
- But... we have been warned:

20:12.400 --> 20:15.000
future searches of the residence are limited to areas

20:15.000 --> 20:17.800
specifically pertaining to the case at hand.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.500
And I think it's best if neither you nor Warrick went back to the house.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
Well, hopefully, we have to. (we won't have to ?)

20:23.200 --> 20:25.700
I was able to get in touch with Caroline's father.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.900
He's on his way back to his house to pick up his daughter's toiletries,

20:28.900 --> 20:30.700
and he'll meet us back here.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.900
We're trying to get a DNA sample from Caroline's personal effects

20:33.900 --> 20:36.900
and compare it to a blood drop that was on the living room steps.

20:36.900 --> 20:40.400
Incidentally, I was able to speak with someone at WLVU.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.900
Tad Sidley was a student there, with the roommate.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.400
Now, Doc Robbins told me the kid had been dead for at least two weeks.

20:47.400 --> 20:52.400
I'd be interested in talking to the roommate
to find out why no one reported him missing.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.800
Absolutely.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.200
- Come with?
- Yeah.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.700
- Okay, guys, good luck.
- Thank you.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.300
- Can I help you?
- This is Tad Sidley's dorm room, right?

21:08.300 --> 21:09.200
Yeah...

21:09.200 --> 21:11.500
Look, whatever he did, I wasn't involved.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.300
When was the last time you saw him?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.700
I-I don't know.
A couple weeks ago.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.700
And why didn't you report him missing?

21:18.300 --> 21:21.300
Look, Tad's a third-year freshman.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.800
Or as he likes to call it, "a three-peater."

21:23.800 --> 21:26.200
He disappears for weeks at a time.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.100
- What happened to him?
- He was murdered.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.100
May we come in?

21:39.800 --> 21:43.600
- Were you and Tad good friends?
- No, not exactly.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.100
Why not?

21:45.500 --> 21:46.800
Look, I study my ass off.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.600
When Tad's here, he's baked for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.000
He's distracting.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.800
He blares his music.
He invites his friends over to party.

21:54.800 --> 21:59.000
He is... or was... inconsiderate.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.900
Fortunately, he wasn't around much.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.500
Any idea who killed him?

22:05.900 --> 22:09.600
Look, the guy was a pain in my ass, but everybody else seemed to love him.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.800
His dad's totally loaded, and Tad was pretty generous.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.100
Catherine...

22:20.000 --> 22:24.400
- Don Fitzgibbons and a phone number.
- Caroline's dad.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.700
What do you know about this?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.600
I never noticed it.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.100
- You mind if I take it with me?
- Go ahead; take whatever you want.

22:35.500 --> 22:40.400
Look, there's this rumor going around campus that if your roommate dies,

22:40.400 --> 22:43.200
you get an automatic 4.0 for the semester.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.800
You know, because of all of the traumatic stress.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.000
Who... who should I talk to about that?

23:41.300 --> 23:43.400
Roof trace analysis.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.500
Afraid it's not going to be very helpful.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.100
- Why?
- Polyethylene plastic.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.300
Compounds used in about a million different products.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.400
I hope that's not all you got.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.500
I don't understand.

23:58.000 --> 24:03.000
If you found blood in Sidley's house, why isn't he in jail?

24:03.000 --> 24:08.600
I mean, can't you at least hold him until you determine whether or not it's Caroline's?

24:09.300 --> 24:11.000
That's not my decision to be made.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.400
Unfortunately, the DA feels that we need more.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.700
It's just like a year ago.

24:19.300 --> 24:23.900
It wasn't enough that I believed that Martin was sleeping with my daughter...

24:24.600 --> 24:27.500
that she disappeared on the way to his house.

24:29.500 --> 24:36.300
Ms. Willows, the man paid her $800 for her photos and told her she had a great eye.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.600
I brought her brushes and combs.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.600
Anything else I could find.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.800
Think you'll be able to get enough DNA off that stuff?

24:53.800 --> 24:56.400
Oh, yes, absolutely.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.700
I know the cops say that if you don't find them quickly,

25:07.700 --> 25:10.000
you don't usually find them alive.

25:11.700 --> 25:21.000
But every time the phone rings or there's a knock at the door, my first thought...

25:21.500 --> 25:27.500
my first hope is that, uh... it's Caroline.

25:30.900 --> 25:38.800
Mr. Fitzgibbons, we found your name and number written on a Post-it

25:38.800 --> 25:41.700
in Tad Sidley's dorm room.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.100
Can you explain how it got there?

25:45.000 --> 25:48.200
When you guys were first investigating her disappearance,

25:48.200 --> 25:54.700
you couldn't get access to Sidley's place, so I appealed to his kid.

25:54.800 --> 26:00.000
Okay, look, I may not like my old man, but he's not a killer.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.900
- And if you think he is, go to the cops.
- The cops can't get a warrant.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.700
I'm not saying he hurt Caroline,

26:04.700 --> 26:07.500
but maybe there's something in your house that will help me find her.

26:07.500 --> 26:08.900
I'm sorry, okay?

26:08.900 --> 26:12.500
- I'm sorry. I can't just...
- Look, maybe you could just talk to him.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.400
Convince him to let me take a look around the place.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.600
Look, I see my dad once a month...

26:17.300 --> 26:18.700
when I pick up my check.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.800
He's not going to listen to me.

26:20.800 --> 26:25.500
All right, if you change your mind, give me a call.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.000
Anytime.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.500
Unfortunately, I never heard from him.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.400
Ms. Willows...

26:41.200 --> 26:44.300
if the blood you found matches my daughter's DNA,

26:45.300 --> 26:47.800
tell me that the bastard's going to jail...

26:48.300 --> 26:50.500
for the rest of his life.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.200
So the DNA I extracted from the hair on Caroline's brush (il me semble entendre "that" entre DNA et I)

26:58.200 --> 27:00.400
is consistent with the blood found on the wood floor.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.200
Thank you.
Case closed.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.400
Now wait a minute.
We only found a single drop of blood.

27:04.400 --> 27:08.100
No doubt Sidley's attorney will argue
that Caroline may have cut herself.

27:08.100 --> 27:09.800
He already admitted that she was in his house.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.200
Oh, come on, you saw the amount of fluorescence on that floor.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.600
You don't use a bucket of bleach to clean up a paper cut.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.300
Yeah, and you don't get a murder conviction off of a single drop of a victim's blood.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.300
So you need to find the body.

27:20.700 --> 27:22.500
That would certainly help.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.600
Sorry to interrupt.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.300
As per protocol, Metro flagged Tad Sidley's credit cards.

27:36.300 --> 27:39.900
A couple of hours ago someone used his Amex to purchase gas in Seven Hills.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.300
Is that someone in custody?

27:41.300 --> 27:44.500
Unfortunately, the Gas and Go cashier ran the card manually.

27:44.500 --> 27:48.200
So by the time the credit card company flagged the purchase the guy had taken off.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.900
But the station has video surveillance and the cashier claims he could ID him.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.000
Have you told Nick and Sara?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.500
Nick's in the AV lab now with the videotape and the cashier.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.400
So the next time this someone uses the credit card...

28:00.400 --> 28:01.600
We're all over it.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.100
You sure you remember this guy who stole Tad Sidley's credit card?

28:07.100 --> 28:08.100
For sure.

28:08.100 --> 28:11.000
It was a platinum and the guy was like young.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.400
I mean, I couldn't even qualify for a Visa.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.200
Grissom, meet Larry.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.200
Larry's from the Gas and Go.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.100
- Thanks for coming in, Larry.
- Oh, for sure.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.000
Wait.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.900
Stop... stop the video.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.500
Yeah, I remember that jacket and the blond hair.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.800
That's his sweet car right behind him.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.100
Lucky son of a bitch.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.300
I drive an '82 Buick.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.100
Nick, try the unsharp mask.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.400
Yeah, that's it.
That's him.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.000
That's your dude.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.200
That's Tad Sidley.
That was the name on the credit card.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.500
- Is this video from today?
- Yeah, I downloaded it myself.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.900
Well, if that's Tad Sidley, who's in the morgue?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.100
- Hey. Thanks for your help.
- No problem.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.500
- I laid out the photos and sketches.
- Thank you.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.100
What are you looking for exactly?

29:19.800 --> 29:23.900
When we showed up at the scene a year ago, Sidley wouldn't let us into his house.

29:23.900 --> 29:26.500
I'm guessing because the body was still inside.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.300
He knew you'd detect the smell.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.800
Kind of like Telltale Heart.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.900
Edgar Allan Poe.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.800
Guy commits a murder and buries the body under the floorboards of his house.

29:37.600 --> 29:42.600
Catherine, I got to tell you, I don't see anything probative.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.100
Are both these sketches drawn to the same scale?

29:45.100 --> 29:47.400
Yeah, half inch equals a foot.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
All right...

29:50.200 --> 29:52.100
The attic is above the living room.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.600
They both share the same chimney.

29:54.700 --> 29:55.700
Yeah?

29:58.500 --> 29:59.600
What are you thinking?

30:00.900 --> 30:06.500
The east wall of the house is 17 feet from the chimney in the living room.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.700
But that same east wall is only 14 feet from the chimney in the attic.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.200
When you retrieved the body, did you excavate the entire chimney?

30:18.200 --> 30:18.900
No.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.600
We just removed the bricks from the west-facing side.

30:27.500 --> 30:31.700
There's no question that somebody extended the brick exterior of this chimney.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.900
There's a slight color disparity between the old and the new bricks.

30:47.900 --> 30:50.500
It's hollow.
There's no clay backing.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.500
This is just a facade.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.600
Catherine...

31:05.200 --> 31:06.600
We found her.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.900
She was still bleeding when she was brought here.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.200
Which means that her heart was probably still beating.

31:22.400 --> 31:26.700
This isn't The Tell-Tale Heart, it's The Cask of Amontillado.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.400
She was sealed into a wall and left to die.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.800
I just got your page.

31:40.800 --> 31:41.900
Did he stick around?

31:41.900 --> 31:45.200
Yeah, we explained the situation, and he thinks it's hilarious.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.000
Tad, Detective Curtis.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.600
I'm glad to see you're okay.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.000
Yeah, me, too.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.300
Uh, he said you wanted to talk to me?

31:53.300 --> 31:56.900
Yeah. Where have you been for the past few weeks?

31:56.900 --> 32:00.100
Tijuana, L.A., quick stop in Santa Barbara.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.500
Just got back this morning.

32:01.500 --> 32:05.200
Any idea how your gym membership got into a dead man's pocket?

32:06.600 --> 32:09.300
No. I'm sorry, I didn't even know it was missing.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.900
I'm-I'm not exactly big on the weights, you know?

32:12.400 --> 32:13.700
Look, uh...

32:14.100 --> 32:15.300
I'm late for a movie.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.200
- You mind if I get out of here?
- Sure.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.600
I'd just like to get your cell phone number.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.800
Gonna ask me out?

32:22.300 --> 32:24.900
It's just in case I have any further questions.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.300
- Caroline did not go gently.
- Defensive marks?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.400
Ten on her right forearm.

32:34.700 --> 32:37.000
Another three on the left.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.300
And several more on the palms.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.900
Catherine, there are tears on her labia and hymen.

32:45.900 --> 32:49.500
Too much time's past to check for semen.
But she was raped.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.900
We found a potential blood pool in the living room and

32:52.900 --> 32:55.000
another much more substantial one in the attic--

32:55.000 --> 32:56.700
is that consistent with your findings?

32:56.700 --> 33:00.500
Yeah. Caroline was stabbed four times, twice to the abdomen,

33:00.500 --> 33:03.300
one to the spleen, one to the intercostal artery.

33:03.300 --> 33:07.500
No vital organs were penetrated, which means she would have bled to death slowly.

33:07.500 --> 33:10.600
Probably stabbed in the living room and then moved to the attic

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
where she continued to bleed until she died.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.100
Is the chimney guy still in your drawer?

33:15.100 --> 33:16.600
Yeah, right over there.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.300
What's going on?

33:21.900 --> 33:23.800
Tad Sidley is alive.

33:23.800 --> 33:28.000
We assumed that this guy was Tad, based on a gym membership card we found on his body--

33:28.000 --> 33:29.800
we were wrong.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.300
This guy is now a John Doe.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.900
- Does his father know?
- Not yet.

33:35.900 --> 33:39.100
Well, I'm on my way to P.D. to meet up with him and his lawyer--

33:39.100 --> 33:40.600
I'll give him the good news.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.400
Like I've already told you, Caroline and I were friends.

33:45.700 --> 33:50.700
Now, if you keep this up, I'm gonna file a harassment charge against you, personally.

33:50.700 --> 33:54.800
Ms. Willows, on the phone you said that you had new information regarding my client's son?

33:54.800 --> 33:55.700
Yes, I will get to that.

33:55.700 --> 34:01.100
But first I wanted to let both of you know that
Caroline's body was recovered in Mr. Sidley's attic.

34:01.100 --> 34:01.800
What?

34:01.800 --> 34:06.200
The coroner confirmed that she was raped,
stabbed and bled to death.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.300
Wait a minute.
You searched the house again?

34:08.300 --> 34:11.000
Ms. Willows, I thought that the judge was perfectly clear.

34:11.100 --> 34:14.400
I searched the chimney, specifically,
in accordance with the original warrant

34:14.400 --> 34:17.300
- and subsequent limitation.
- I didn't do it, I swear.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.199
You live alone, Mr. Sidley...

34:20.500 --> 34:26.699
and you have no idea how her body
got bricked into your attic?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.500
Oh, come on.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
What happened?

34:31.100 --> 34:33.000
Did she say no one too many times?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.600
Ms. Willows, you are way over the line.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.000
If you didn't kill her, Mr. Sidley, then tell me,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.900
is there anyone else who had access to your house?

34:42.300 --> 34:45.699
Who else could have raped Caroline under your roof?

34:49.199 --> 34:50.199
I know what happened.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.400
- Martin...
- No.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
I've been covering too long.
I need to tell the truth.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.600
I was out of town, I came home early.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.900
I heard noise coming from the attic.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.200
He told me that they'd been seeing each other...

35:06.200 --> 35:07.600
- What's going on?
- Dad...

35:07.600 --> 35:11.700
....that they'd gotten into a fight, and he raped and killed her.

35:12.700 --> 35:18.900
I should have told the police, but... she was already dead.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.600
He's my son.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.900
I wanted to protect him.

35:23.900 --> 35:25.800
I didn't know what else to do.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.100
Son of a bitch.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.100
He's lying.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.600
Do you want to tell us what actually happened?

35:39.700 --> 35:41.500
I have no idea what really happened.

35:43.700 --> 35:47.200
I met her once... at the house.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.900
A month or so later, I see her on the news-- she's missing.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.700
I can tell you that for two weeks after that,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.200
he wouldn't let me anywhere near the house.

36:01.500 --> 36:05.400
Claimed that he was painting, and he didn't want me breathing in the fumes.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.100
He killed her.

36:13.300 --> 36:14.500
I'm sure of it.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.800
Well, if you'd like to have a word with your old man,

36:18.800 --> 36:20.900
I'd say now would be the time.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.300
Hi, Dad.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.300
Heard everything.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.400
Tad...

36:34.900 --> 36:38.300
- Son, you're...
- Yeah. I'm not dead.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.900
You're dead to me.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.200
This is Catherine.

36:53.200 --> 36:57.000
Hey, Cat, when you're done at P.D. can you head over to the print lab?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
There's something you're gonna want to see.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.700
I'm on my way.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.100
I know why a John Doe was stuffed down the Sidley's chimney.

37:11.100 --> 37:14.100
When you and Warrick were working that missing persons case,

37:14.100 --> 37:16.900
you couldn't get a warrant, and Martin wouldn't let you in, right?

37:16.900 --> 37:17.700
Right.

37:17.700 --> 37:20.900
Don Fitzgibbons tried to gain access to the house through the son...

37:20.900 --> 37:22.900
But the son wouldn't cooperate.

37:22.900 --> 37:27.000
I think he knew that if the house became a crime scene,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.800
CSI could get in there.

37:30.400 --> 37:35.400
Well, it's a logical theory, but to kill someone and stuff him in a chimney

37:35.400 --> 37:38.500
in hopes of getting information on your missing daughter...

37:40.800 --> 37:42.300
Check out the screen.

37:42.300 --> 37:46.500
On the left is an unknown fingerprint I lifted off the chimney cap.

37:46.500 --> 37:51.300
On the right is a partial I lifted off of Don Fitzgibbons' post-it

37:51.300 --> 37:53.100
you took out of Tad's dorm room.

37:53.100 --> 37:58.400
Now, the print on the post-it is only a partial, but it's a match to the chimney cap.

37:58.400 --> 38:03.300
I also found trace evidence on the roof.
Polyethylene plastic.

38:03.300 --> 38:06.800
Don Fitzgibbons works at Desert Palms Hospital.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.600
I just got off the phone with the administrator.

38:08.600 --> 38:13.000
- The hospital's body bags are made out of...
- Polyethylene plastic?

38:13.700 --> 38:18.000
Don Fitzgibbons has access to those body bags.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
It's true.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.300
All of it.

38:40.700 --> 38:41.900
You gonna arrest me?

38:41.900 --> 38:44.900
You just admitted to murder; I think you know the answer.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.100
Hold on.

38:46.100 --> 38:47.700
I didn't kill anyone.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.700
And the body in the chimney?

38:54.100 --> 38:58.300
I took the body from Desert Palm Hospital, from the morgue.

38:58.300 --> 39:01.100
He was already dead, John Doe.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.800
Auto accident in a stolen vehicle.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.700
Car exploded, he was burned beyond recognition.

39:08.000 --> 39:13.800
Ms. Willows, I stole a dead body and I trespassed, but that's it.

39:15.600 --> 39:20.600
And Tad Sidley's I.D., did you place the gym card on the body?

39:20.600 --> 39:22.200
You're a mother, right?

39:23.500 --> 39:24.700
Yes.

39:27.300 --> 39:29.300
Why do you think I did it?

39:33.200 --> 39:37.800
You wanted Martin Sidley to know what it's like to lose a child.

39:44.600 --> 39:49.300
When I was in Tad's dorm room, I snagged it.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.700
I scorched the surface of the card to make it look like it belonged to the John Doe...

39:56.400 --> 40:00.600
to make Martin believe that it was his son.

40:04.300 --> 40:08.000
I'd hoped that you'd be able to restore the image.

40:12.700 --> 40:13.600
Look...

40:14.300 --> 40:19.600
I wish I could say that I was sorry for the trouble I've put you through,

40:19.600 --> 40:23.200
or the-the petty crimes that I've committed,

40:23.800 --> 40:25.600
but I didn't hurt anyone...

40:27.300 --> 40:30.500
and Martin Sidley is behind bars,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.700
and my daughter's getting her funeral.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.000
And that's all I wanted.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.900
I'm sorry.

40:53.500 --> 41:00.100
I'm sorry that we couldn't find your daughter without your help.
