M_I_SForEver

02:28.709 --> 02:31.374
In sure and
certain hope of the resurrection

02:31.407 --> 02:35.441
to eternal life through
our Lord Jesus Christ,

02:35.474 --> 02:39.474
we commend to Almighty God,
our sister Abigail Peller.

02:39.974 --> 02:43.274
And we commit her body
to the ground;

02:43.307 --> 02:47.207
earth to earth, ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.

02:49.041 --> 02:50.240
Amen!

03:20.441 --> 03:22.941
Mum wanted you to have
all her stuff from the house,

03:22.974 --> 03:24.374
the both of you.

03:24.974 --> 03:28.307
To be honest it's mostly old
books and a load of junk but...

03:28.340 --> 03:30.542
I can easily drop it off at the
charity shop if you want?

03:30.575 --> 03:31.842
We'll pop over and
have a look.

03:31.874 --> 03:33.441
Well you'd better be
quick.

03:33.474 --> 03:35.508
Your mother and I start
clearing the house on Saturday.

03:36.274 --> 03:38.608
Make sure you do the driving
Anna ok? Course.

03:39.441 --> 03:40.274
Read your thing.

03:41.874 --> 03:43.240
I don't know. I might leave it.

03:43.274 --> 03:44.941
No go on, just do it.

03:46.642 --> 03:47.542
What's this?

03:48.642 --> 03:51.207
Um... Hello everyone.

03:51.742 --> 03:54.441
I'd like to read a poem
in memory of Nana Abigail.

03:55.207 --> 03:57.608
Awake to hear the
sweet harps play.

03:58.141 --> 04:00.542
To love before him on his way.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.575
And the night wind
answering in antiphon.

04:04.608 --> 04:06.475
Till night is overgone.

04:07.908 --> 04:11.240
Play on, invisible
harps, unto Love.

04:11.775 --> 04:14.608
Whose way in heaven is
aglow at that hour

04:14.642 --> 04:16.374
when soft lights come
and go.

04:17.075 --> 04:19.675
Soft sweet music
in the air above.

04:20.475 --> 04:21.874
And in the earth below.

04:24.974 --> 04:25.908
That was lovely.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.575
It was very sweet,
it was very moving.

04:30.508 --> 04:32.542
Why don't you go and rest?

05:51.475 --> 05:52.475
You're ok.

05:55.008 --> 05:57.475
It was just a small one.
Just a small one.

06:01.608 --> 06:03.874
She'll be fine.
She just needs to rest.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.808
Well if you're sure?
Yeah of course.

06:06.841 --> 06:07.774
Yeah, that's
really lovely.

06:08.141 --> 06:09.508
Listen, I'll just
get my coat ok?

06:09.542 --> 06:12.408
- Thanks Hun.
- Bye Dad

06:12.442 --> 06:14.274
Nana would've been
really pleased.

06:15.941 --> 06:18.941
She's up there right now,
looking down on us all

06:18.974 --> 06:20.408
with the good
lord, laughing.

06:26.341 --> 06:27.240
You alright?

06:32.274 --> 06:34.308
Let me prop you up a bit.
Make you nice and comfy.

06:41.708 --> 06:42.941
You need to drink that,

06:43.841 --> 06:45.408
It's nice and sweet.

06:48.974 --> 06:50.608
I think you should go back to
the doctor and get your

06:50.642 --> 06:53.708
medication reviewed or at
least let them...

06:53.741 --> 06:55.542
Well... You know.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.475
What happens if I'm not
here and you have a fit?

06:59.508 --> 07:02.408
And what if I'm staying at
Dan's and... Fine, fine I'll go.

07:03.774 --> 07:05.408
I'm just upset about Nan.

07:06.508 --> 07:07.741
Yeah, I know.

07:10.308 --> 07:11.207
I tell you what...

07:11.841 --> 07:14.008
Why don't you get dressed and
we'll pop round to Nan's

07:14.041 --> 07:15.908
before
Mum dumps all her stuff?

07:16.874 --> 07:19.207
It'll give us a chance to
find something sentimental.

07:23.974 --> 07:25.808
Looks like Mum's
been here already.

07:26.308 --> 07:29.207
I know, I wanted to look
through everything first.

07:31.542 --> 07:32.674
Is that a book of spells?

07:33.108 --> 07:34.741
No, I
think it's stories.

07:36.808 --> 07:37.874
Listen to this.

07:38.674 --> 07:43.275
Remedies prescribed for those
who by prest-id-ig-i-tory

07:43.308 --> 07:45.207
art have lost their
virile members.

07:47.341 --> 07:50.241
Is prestidi-thingie ye
olde English for shagging?

07:52.641 --> 07:54.641
I think it's like, magic
tricks or something like that.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.442
With their virile members?
That sounds sexy.

08:22.008 --> 08:24.874
They had courted from
a young age and life was happy.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.574
Then came
the Great War,

08:28.607 --> 08:31.241
and she would not see him
again for many years.

08:32.874 --> 08:34.308
On his return,

08:34.341 --> 08:36.640
she loved him as she
had always done,

08:36.674 --> 08:39.375
...but a changeling
had come back in his place.

08:40.542 --> 08:44.408
The eager boy had
gone, and an angry man returned.

08:45.408 --> 08:48.308
Times were hard
and his anger worsened.

08:49.475 --> 08:51.375
He refused
to see his children

08:51.408 --> 08:53.841
and she would suffer
daily by his hand.

08:54.874 --> 08:57.208
She took to walking
in the woods at night,

08:58.208 --> 08:59.908
...where she would fall
upon her knees

08:59.941 --> 09:02.708
and plead to the
heavens for an end to the hurt.

09:04.475 --> 09:06.708
The heavens
remained silent throughout,

09:07.408 --> 09:09.908
...but another voice
answered in their stead.

09:10.541 --> 09:13.708
An old woman appeared
and told her that she too had

09:13.741 --> 09:15.442
suffered at the hand of man...

09:17.541 --> 09:19.908
...and that she would
take away the husband forever...

09:21.674 --> 09:25.341
...and give the woman
back her peace. For a price.

09:25.674 --> 09:27.574
Desperate,
she accepted.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.674
In return,
the old woman

09:29.708 --> 09:32.408
demanded to be given care
of the daughter.

09:37.874 --> 09:40.708
Seven days later came
a great fire,

09:40.974 --> 09:45.708
and it was not just
the man who would perish,

09:45.741 --> 09:50.341
...but the woman's sons
too. Only her daughter survived.

10:11.808 --> 10:13.375
What?

10:16.607 --> 10:17.474
Tea?

10:18.241 --> 10:19.774
Thanks... I'll have
it in the bath.

11:02.408 --> 11:03.874
You haven't fallen
asleep in there have ya?

11:04.607 --> 11:05.474
No.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.874
Do you ever feel
as though you're...

11:34.474 --> 11:36.275
...slowly fading
out of existence?

11:38.474 --> 11:39.275
As if...

11:41.741 --> 11:43.874
As if we're barely
even here any more.

11:47.674 --> 11:48.474
Days just...

11:50.341 --> 11:50.874
...drift by.

11:54.574 --> 11:55.341
Anna?

11:57.674 --> 11:58.774
Yeah, it is what it is.

12:00.874 --> 12:01.774
Get some sleep, huh?

12:07.341 --> 12:08.975
What?

12:09.009 --> 12:10.941
But I wanna come back, I'm fine.

12:14.308 --> 12:15.674
How long?

12:20.741 --> 12:23.308
Well I wouldn't want to give
the company a bad name would I?

12:26.541 --> 12:27.474
Well?

12:29.340 --> 12:30.975
I'm officially signed
off for three months.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.975
They don't want me having an
episode in front of a client.

12:36.340 --> 12:36.874
Christ!

12:51.474 --> 12:52.340
Shit!

12:55.975 --> 12:59.340
Stop Mr Postman.
Wait Mr Postman.

13:00.474 --> 13:03.275
Where have you gone
Mr Postman?

13:10.009 --> 13:10.808
Ahh fuck!

13:19.541 --> 13:20.407
Please be open.

14:13.441 --> 14:14.208
Hello?

14:14.441 --> 14:15.774
Oh hello darling.

14:16.042 --> 14:17.574
I just want to
make sure you were home

14:17.607 --> 14:19.674
because me and your dad
were going to pop over.

14:20.441 --> 14:21.875
I bought a
new nail varnish

14:23.009 --> 14:24.708
to cheer
myself up after mum.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.374
Well, you know.

14:28.340 --> 14:29.607
Deep rouge.

14:30.009 --> 14:31.708
You'll love it.

14:31.942 --> 14:33.541
Anyway, so
we'll be over in...

14:33.574 --> 14:34.340
Th-th-that's fine.

14:37.741 --> 14:39.340
Darling. What's wrong?

14:39.875 --> 14:41.441
That's fine...
I mean, I'm fine mum.

14:43.009 --> 14:43.741
Come over whenever.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.474
I'm in all day.

15:45.042 --> 15:46.909
This is the color
I was telling you about.

15:47.240 --> 15:50.809
It's identical to the one that
nail lady was using

15:50.842 --> 15:52.942
and charging
us a fortune for.

15:53.141 --> 15:54.307
Nice isn't it?

15:56.541 --> 15:57.274
My god.

15:58.875 --> 15:59.842
Your nose.

16:01.574 --> 16:03.441
Roy... Roy. A tissue! A tissue!

16:05.009 --> 16:06.607
To the kitchen. Come on.
Mum, calm down.

16:07.541 --> 16:09.541
- Mum.
- Head back. Come on.

16:12.607 --> 16:13.474
Pinch your nose.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.742
It's alright. Put your head
back. That's it, that's it.

16:17.474 --> 16:18.240
That's it.

16:19.574 --> 16:20.541
See, it's stopped.

16:21.307 --> 16:21.875
Alright?

16:24.042 --> 16:24.842
This happened before?

16:27.340 --> 16:28.340
What's going on?

16:33.042 --> 16:33.842
Oh, come here.

16:36.674 --> 16:38.274
I wish you'd
talk to me, you know?

16:39.775 --> 16:40.842
I can help you.

16:45.674 --> 16:46.842
I prayed for you
last night, you know?

16:48.607 --> 16:49.407
Alright?

16:50.108 --> 16:52.407
Thought I'd
put another pot on.

16:57.441 --> 16:58.775
It's okay love. Hey...

16:59.175 --> 17:00.909
Come on... Alright.

17:00.942 --> 17:02.909
I'll handle this, thank you Roy.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.339
- What?
- Go.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.909
I think I was about your
age when this picture was taken.

17:29.407 --> 17:30.709
Where was your house?

17:31.541 --> 17:35.842
Oh, not far. Near here. But long
gone. It burned down.

17:37.009 --> 17:39.975
And then they built the Wishing
Tree Estate over the top of it.

17:40.675 --> 17:43.240
Is that your mum?
My great grandma?

17:44.009 --> 17:44.842
No... Linda...

17:45.975 --> 17:46.809
She's your grandmother.

17:47.307 --> 17:49.709
No. I'm Claire, Grandma.

17:50.008 --> 17:51.742
Linda's my mummy?

17:52.875 --> 17:53.875
Oh dear. Um.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.742
Not to worry my sweet.

17:58.507 --> 18:00.875
Just don't make her upset. As
long as you don't question her.

18:02.075 --> 18:05.374
You mustn't speak about her.
She'll think you're being rude.

18:06.842 --> 18:07.642
You're not are you?

18:07.942 --> 18:10.507
No no no no. Now you
go outside and play

18:10.541 --> 18:11.842
and I'll speak to her.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.742
She's just a child...
A silly foolish child.

18:17.041 --> 18:17.875
Go Linda.

18:18.507 --> 18:19.240
Go now.

20:15.575 --> 20:16.742
I'll stay at yours tonight yeah?

20:19.407 --> 20:20.274
I'd love that...

20:21.709 --> 20:22.474
But?

20:25.340 --> 20:27.742
But, Claire really
needs me right now.

20:28.642 --> 20:29.407
Oh for God's sake.

20:30.075 --> 20:31.709
No listen, babe.
She's my sister.

20:32.542 --> 20:33.908
I can't just turn
my back on her now.

20:35.608 --> 20:37.642
The seizures are
getting more frequent.

20:38.742 --> 20:40.508
To be honest, as things are now,

20:40.542 --> 20:42.675
I don't see much of a
future for her.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.709
She's really fragile.

20:44.675 --> 20:46.575
Yeah but, what about our future?

20:47.809 --> 20:48.841
What about it?

20:49.307 --> 20:51.207
I'm not going anywhere are you?

20:52.441 --> 20:53.675
Well not for the
next half hour or so.

20:55.407 --> 20:56.475
Yeah well.

20:56.508 --> 20:59.874
I've got about 8 minutes
so let's forget the faff.

21:00.274 --> 21:01.575
Alright, deal.

21:12.642 --> 21:15.207
I gotta go... I need
to check on Claire.

21:17.709 --> 21:18.575
Alright?

21:19.442 --> 21:20.307
Yeah, yeah.

21:23.008 --> 21:24.207
Fancy going out later?

21:25.742 --> 21:26.775
Yeah. Why not?

21:27.742 --> 21:28.808
Help take my mind off things.

21:30.974 --> 21:32.675
Dan might pop along too.

21:33.742 --> 21:35.307
Um, I was thinking.

21:37.008 --> 21:38.408
Go easy on the booze.

21:39.808 --> 21:40.974
Fits and all that.

21:42.340 --> 21:42.874
Alright.

22:00.008 --> 22:01.941
Hey, Brad the lad!

22:03.008 --> 22:04.240
Alright Dan?

22:04.274 --> 22:05.442
Have you
got a bird mate?

22:05.642 --> 22:07.475
Yeah I, I've, I've got a...

22:08.274 --> 22:09.941
Couple of girls on
at the minute.

22:11.808 --> 22:12.874
Alright, so no.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.575
Wow, hey, you are totally
coming out with me tonight.

22:16.608 --> 22:17.874
Yeah?

22:17.908 --> 22:20.941
Yeah. So, hey, don't let
me down. Six thirty, on the PM.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.741
Do I need to go home
and get changed?

22:23.774 --> 22:25.340
Mate, you're good
as you are. Chill out.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.874
Alright darling. I heard heaven
was missing an angel,

22:34.908 --> 22:36.675
and here you are.

22:36.709 --> 22:39.408
Do you really go in for all that
cheesy role play stuff with Dan?

22:39.908 --> 22:41.575
I don't know what you're
talking about Sis.

22:41.608 --> 22:43.941
I can handle Dan The
Man, don't you worry.

22:58.642 --> 22:59.508
I'm fine.

23:01.341 --> 23:02.675
It's just a wobble.

23:10.341 --> 23:11.475
Look, Claire.

23:11.508 --> 23:12.542
First thing in the morning
you are calling the doctor.

23:12.575 --> 23:14.841
And if you don't, I'm
gonna do it for you.

23:17.708 --> 23:18.874
I don't get it.

23:19.675 --> 23:22.341
Something's not right.
What's changed?

23:22.974 --> 23:24.908
It's happening more and more.

23:26.408 --> 23:27.741
Don't Anna, not now,

23:29.941 --> 23:30.741
It's not me.

23:31.808 --> 23:33.475
What do you mean, it's not you?

23:36.408 --> 23:37.240
Anna.

23:37.974 --> 23:39.874
I'm seeing things...
In this house.

23:41.774 --> 23:42.741
What things?

23:43.608 --> 23:45.708
I don't know.

23:45.741 --> 23:46.508
People.

23:47.908 --> 23:49.674
An old woman, a child.

23:52.408 --> 23:54.874
I don't know. I'm not ill...
It's more than that.

23:56.808 --> 23:58.608
An old woman and a child?

24:00.841 --> 24:03.741
You're just missing Nan and
the meds are messing with ya.

24:04.008 --> 24:06.475
For Christ's sake, my
house isn't haunted.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.375
Look Claire, I can deal with the

24:08.408 --> 24:11.674
mood swings and the depression
and the seizures, but this...

24:11.708 --> 24:12.974
I am not joking.

24:13.008 --> 24:14.674
I have been face
to face with them.

24:15.542 --> 24:17.874
They are as clear as you are
sitting in front of me now.

24:19.275 --> 24:22.475
- Anna.
- And, they're in my dreams.

24:23.141 --> 24:25.442
In this house,
everywhere I go...

24:30.475 --> 24:31.575
Look...

24:32.207 --> 24:35.341
You need to get your drugs
sorted, and find that balance.

24:38.908 --> 24:40.708
We're both missing Nan.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.008
You've got to be
stronger than this hun.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.874
We can't look after
you forever.

24:50.974 --> 24:51.841
Come on.

24:52.442 --> 24:53.708
You could do with a night out.

24:56.674 --> 24:57.741
You're right.

24:59.974 --> 25:01.808
Just the meds, I guess.

25:03.607 --> 25:04.741
Sorry Sis.

25:21.475 --> 25:22.442
You a big drinker then Claire?

25:23.475 --> 25:25.308
Why? Do I look
like a big drinker?

25:26.008 --> 25:26.774
Dunno.

25:29.741 --> 25:31.607
I'm more of a lager man myself.

25:32.874 --> 25:33.741
How nice.

25:36.708 --> 25:39.574
Last date I had,
absolute disaster.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.641
The shop was shut for
refurbishment,

25:44.674 --> 25:45.908
if you know what I mean?

25:46.841 --> 25:47.874
Or should've been, anyway.

25:50.607 --> 25:52.874
It was like a car
crash down there.

25:54.308 --> 25:55.641
She didn't seem to mind, though.

26:00.475 --> 26:01.241
Hey.

26:01.275 --> 26:01.908
You alright?

26:06.741 --> 26:07.607
Yeah, I...

26:10.475 --> 26:11.442
I want to leave.

26:12.341 --> 26:12.908
Now.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.341
Dan.

26:17.708 --> 26:18.574
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

26:40.008 --> 26:42.641
Listen Hun, I've said this so
many times now,

26:42.674 --> 26:44.408
turn your bedroom light
off when you go out.

26:44.442 --> 26:45.974
I always turn my light off.
What are you talking about?

26:46.008 --> 26:46.774
Well, what's that then?

26:59.541 --> 27:00.908
I'll call
it a night I think.

27:11.408 --> 27:13.341
Can I get you something
Bradley Bunch?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.241
Yeah, I'll have a squash.

27:30.441 --> 27:31.308
Jesus!

27:31.741 --> 27:32.741
Are you alright?

27:33.008 --> 27:34.774
Yeah. I'll um...

27:39.541 --> 27:40.708
Give you a
call tomorrow alright?

27:43.275 --> 27:45.241
See you tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow won't I?

27:49.341 --> 27:50.941
Jesus, Claire, that was a bit
cold wasn't it?

27:52.008 --> 27:52.941
Excuse me?

27:52.974 --> 27:54.308
Well I mean he's a nice guy.

27:54.341 --> 27:56.208
Would a goodbye kiss have
killed you?

27:57.441 --> 27:58.874
Did you hear what
he said in the pub?

27:59.308 --> 28:00.607
The man is revolting.

28:01.241 --> 28:03.974
How dare you fix me up on a
blind date with no warning.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.474
And with someone who's clearly

28:06.507 --> 28:08.474
never been in the presence of a
woman apart from his mum.

28:08.507 --> 28:10.641
And secondly,
is that my league now?

28:10.874 --> 28:11.874
Dan the Man.

28:12.176 --> 28:13.741
Is that how you've
marked my scorecard?

28:14.275 --> 28:15.441
You know what?

28:15.974 --> 28:17.208
Fuck the pair of you.

30:04.674 --> 30:05.574
It was just a dream.

30:09.042 --> 30:09.874
Get some sleep.

30:21.874 --> 30:23.909
She's adamant
the house is haunted.

30:26.274 --> 30:27.307
I don't know.

30:30.307 --> 30:31.808
What if it's not
a medical thing?

30:33.674 --> 30:35.674
Yea, I'm not saying
that Dan, but...

30:38.009 --> 30:39.875
Look, I've gotta go,
I'll speak to you later.

30:49.841 --> 30:50.942
Dan, can I have a word?

30:50.975 --> 30:52.574
Little busy right
now, Bradleykins.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.708
Last night when we
got to your house.

30:55.741 --> 30:56.674
Yeah about that...

30:58.474 --> 31:00.274
It was wrong to set you
up with Claire, mate.

31:00.307 --> 31:01.507
Her head's all over
the place right now.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.208
Just, take no
notice yeah? Sorry.

31:03.741 --> 31:05.240
Just let me finish Dan.

31:05.274 --> 31:08.207
No, look, um...
I should explain.

31:09.474 --> 31:10.474
She's not...

31:11.374 --> 31:12.407
She's not right in head.

31:13.340 --> 31:16.474
She reckons she's
seeing things, people.

31:18.674 --> 31:19.641
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:20.374 --> 31:21.708
Anna and I thought
it would be good

31:21.741 --> 31:23.474
to get her out
the house for a bit.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.741
That's why I thought it
would be nice to... you know.

31:27.340 --> 31:27.942
Well...

31:28.774 --> 31:29.842
What if she is Dan?

31:29.875 --> 31:31.774
I mean, this is what I
wanted to talk to you about.

31:33.374 --> 31:35.541
That house. When we
went inside it...

31:36.340 --> 31:37.674
Oh god, not you as well.

31:38.009 --> 31:41.307
It was in the hallway ok?
A child wearing a mask.

31:42.574 --> 31:43.507
Maybe I was lagered up but...

31:43.741 --> 31:44.607
I've gotta get this.

31:44.942 --> 31:45.875
Dan Philips.

31:50.340 --> 31:51.741
So...

31:51.774 --> 31:54.574
How's the, um, new
medication coming along?

31:56.009 --> 31:57.207
What's it called? Keppra?

31:59.407 --> 32:01.741
Is it having any
impact on the... fits?

32:02.441 --> 32:03.441
Dunno.

32:06.474 --> 32:07.507
How's Anna, love?

32:08.142 --> 32:09.708
All this can't be
that easy on her.

32:11.009 --> 32:12.474
What's that supposed to mean?

32:14.708 --> 32:15.975
Sweetheart, she called us.

32:18.641 --> 32:21.942
She's worried. She really cares
about you and...

32:22.809 --> 32:25.775
All this nonsense...
And seeing things.

32:25.809 --> 32:28.641
I can't believe she called you.
What a bitch.

32:28.674 --> 32:29.641
Oh come on Claire! She has...

32:30.942 --> 32:33.307
We've been discussing it, hmm?

32:33.809 --> 32:34.975
We've made a decision.
We're going to go private.

32:35.909 --> 32:36.875
That's your dad's idea.

32:36.909 --> 32:39.009
I still want you to come
to the church with me.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.507
We have found a really good
specialist.

32:41.541 --> 32:44.441
He's gonna sort
you out ok?

32:44.474 --> 32:45.340
It's not your fault my love.

32:45.374 --> 32:46.042
Dad!

32:46.076 --> 32:47.207
No, no, don't "Dad" me Claire.

32:48.441 --> 32:51.507
Actually we have an
appraisal later on today

32:51.541 --> 32:53.407
and I will be taking you.

34:03.009 --> 34:03.875
Father.

34:05.041 --> 34:05.909
Hello Claire.

34:06.641 --> 34:07.709
Father.

34:09.574 --> 34:10.474
Whatever's the matter?

34:13.975 --> 34:16.407
Here we are. Careful, it's hot.

34:22.306 --> 34:23.942
So tell me, what's
troubling you?

34:28.909 --> 34:30.373
Everyone thinks
I'm going mental.

34:32.007 --> 34:33.474
Why would they think that?

34:36.340 --> 34:36.875
How would you react...

34:38.909 --> 34:40.742
If someone told you
they were seeing things?

34:42.809 --> 34:44.641
People that aren't there.

34:46.507 --> 34:48.742
And are you? Seeing things?

34:51.340 --> 34:51.909
Every day.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.440
I don't know what to do.

34:56.608 --> 34:57.608
Now listen to me.

34:58.675 --> 35:02.742
Let's assume for a moment that
you are seeing actual spirits.

35:03.909 --> 35:06.809
It's very rare for these things
to occur all of a sudden.

35:08.541 --> 35:11.742
They're usually brought on by
people dabbling in the occult.

35:13.608 --> 35:14.875
These things open doors.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.207
Now...

35:19.642 --> 35:20.742
Think very carefully.

35:22.709 --> 35:24.340
Could there have been a time

35:24.374 --> 35:28.207
where you may have invited
evil into your life?

35:31.041 --> 35:36.809
No, Father. Didn't start til
my nan passed away.

35:57.274 --> 35:58.941
The church is
always here for you Claire.

36:00.742 --> 36:01.974
Here, take these.

36:04.340 --> 36:05.908
Read Psalm 91.

36:06.307 --> 36:09.474
Whoever dwells in the
shelter of the most high,

36:09.507 --> 36:11.775
will rest in the
shadow of the almighty.

36:12.108 --> 36:12.875
Claire!

36:14.340 --> 36:14.941
I'd better go.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.908
Remember... God is
greater than any evil.

36:53.809 --> 36:55.508
Sorry, I got talking to Father.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.809
Claire, what you
are experiencing...

36:57.842 --> 37:00.307
it is a medical issue.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.809
Darling, I really want to help,
I am trying to be patient,

37:02.842 --> 37:04.908
but if you let these God
botherers start

37:04.941 --> 37:06.775
feeding you their nonsense
we are only going to

37:06.809 --> 37:08.207
end up right back at
the beginning.

37:08.974 --> 37:10.340
Obviously don't tell
your Mother I said that.

37:12.407 --> 37:13.874
You're having hallucinations
for Christ's sake.

37:14.775 --> 37:15.809
Yeah, that's what they are.

37:15.841 --> 37:16.575
Hmm? What?

37:16.608 --> 37:17.642
I said yes, Dad.

37:26.307 --> 37:27.974
Well it's a pleasure to
meet both of you together,

37:28.008 --> 37:28.908
but I just wonder, Roy,

37:28.941 --> 37:30.809
would it be possible for
Claire and I just

37:30.841 --> 37:33.240
to have a one-to-one
just on our own?

37:33.274 --> 37:34.742
Just for a few minutes.
Would that be ok?

37:36.374 --> 37:37.874
- Yes of course.
- Great.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.274
Just explain everything that's
been going on.

37:43.307 --> 37:44.240
What you've been
experiencing.

37:44.775 --> 37:46.775
And what you told Anna,
and of course the fits.

37:48.407 --> 37:49.442
I'll be just outside.

37:50.340 --> 37:51.841
Thank you.

37:52.874 --> 37:54.407
So Claire, just to
make it clear,

37:54.442 --> 37:55.974
this is in no way a
session or anything like that.

37:56.008 --> 37:57.974
It's just a preliminary chat.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.908
Because it was your dad that
first contacted the clinic and

38:01.941 --> 38:04.407
it was your dad that said you
were seeing things.

38:04.442 --> 38:07.841
I just wanted to hear, in
your own words, um...

38:09.542 --> 38:10.340
What's been happening?

38:16.974 --> 38:21.642
My mother and my father,
hold quite strong views.

38:24.808 --> 38:26.307
Life's been difficult.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.841
But actually I feel
far better today

38:30.874 --> 38:32.240
after speaking to a priest.

38:34.608 --> 38:35.408
Hmm...

38:38.941 --> 38:40.108
So you understand that you are

38:40.141 --> 38:43.941
on a new cocktail of drugs to
try and deal with it all,

38:43.974 --> 38:45.642
the seizures you've been having?
And that they're working?

38:46.974 --> 38:49.874
I've been through all of
your GP's notes and...

38:50.675 --> 38:54.575
I fully support all of
the medications

38:54.608 --> 38:55.808
that you've been
prescribed.

38:55.841 --> 38:57.808
But it just appears that
you're suffering

38:57.841 --> 39:01.442
from some unforeseen reactions.

39:02.475 --> 39:04.642
So that's what this is, is it?

39:06.408 --> 39:07.442
A reaction issue?

39:08.741 --> 39:09.808
Maybe.

39:11.741 --> 39:14.908
That would be convenient for us
to assume that, but I think...

39:15.575 --> 39:17.741
I think we might be being naive.

39:20.008 --> 39:22.274
You know, in my experience,

39:22.307 --> 39:26.741
seeing things often comes from a
more deep-rooted problem.

39:31.274 --> 39:33.240
Tell me, did your
priest recommend

39:33.274 --> 39:36.408
that you <i>not</i>
see a medical professional?

39:40.408 --> 39:41.575
He believed me.

39:44.874 --> 39:48.741
Claire, I'm absolutely sure that
when you're experiencing

39:48.774 --> 39:50.874
these things they feel
very real.

39:51.475 --> 39:52.240
No doubt.

39:53.675 --> 39:56.874
But, I'd like to get
you into an MRI scan.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.274
Because I think that if you can

40:01.308 --> 40:04.575
accept that these
things aren't real,

40:04.608 --> 40:06.207
you can make that jump.

40:07.475 --> 40:08.542
Then it's gonna make
your treatment

40:08.575 --> 40:10.274
a whole lot easier.

40:10.874 --> 40:11.642
Understand?

40:13.008 --> 40:15.741
You need to accept that
you need medical help.

40:17.741 --> 40:18.542
Okay?

40:30.575 --> 40:31.741
Are you gonna be alright kid?

40:32.808 --> 40:33.608
I'll be fine Dad.

40:57.641 --> 40:58.708
Alright?

40:58.741 --> 41:00.508
Yeah, come and have a sit down,
I wanna talk to you.

41:09.607 --> 41:10.741
I spoke to mum & dad.

41:11.874 --> 41:13.341
I know.

41:14.408 --> 41:15.341
Why would you do that?

41:18.575 --> 41:20.575
We thought it was only right
to let them know the situation.

41:20.607 --> 41:21.375
We?

41:22.175 --> 41:24.442
So Dan has joined the
official committee

41:24.475 --> 41:25.808
of matters pertaining
to Claire has he?

41:30.974 --> 41:34.475
Do you know just how much shit

41:34.508 --> 41:36.241
will occur now you've
dragged them in?

41:37.408 --> 41:38.341
I've now got mum and

41:38.375 --> 41:40.442
the rest of the god
squad preaching to me.

41:40.475 --> 41:42.874
Dad just thinks I'm mental
and needs dosing up.

41:44.442 --> 41:45.774
It will be fine Hun.

41:45.808 --> 41:46.774
Well it wasn't.

41:48.308 --> 41:49.574
It was horrendous.

41:49.607 --> 41:53.941
Me and Dan both believe
you're experiencing something.

41:56.741 --> 41:57.841
What did the doctor say?

41:58.408 --> 42:01.341
The doctor said there's a
medical answer to all this.

42:01.841 --> 42:03.841
Father O'Shea wants to know if I

42:03.874 --> 42:06.208
could've let the devil into my
life unknowingly.

42:07.008 --> 42:09.308
I got... these.

42:10.341 --> 42:11.308
And a cup of tea.

42:14.041 --> 42:15.974
I sat on them in the
car so Dad didn't see.

42:21.341 --> 42:22.874
I don't know whether
to laugh or cry.

42:25.508 --> 42:27.607
Why don't you ask Mum and Dad,
see what they'd do.

42:29.607 --> 42:30.574
Oh hang on a minute.

42:30.874 --> 42:31.674
Shut up!

42:32.208 --> 42:36.874
You know you're Mum's fave.
At least you work properly.

42:36.908 --> 42:40.008
Yeah, Claire, this isn't you
talking. It's the illness.

42:40.041 --> 42:41.741
No, this is definitely me.

42:43.308 --> 42:46.475
Ok fine. I'm gonna
head out to see Dan.

42:48.641 --> 42:52.241
Great. Whatever. Enjoy your
evening of rapey

42:52.275 --> 42:54.874
sex talk followed by a
sixty second shag.

43:48.408 --> 43:49.908
Sorry I'm late.

43:49.941 --> 43:51.574
That's alright. Shall we order?
Kitchen closes soon.

43:51.607 --> 43:52.375
Yeah.

43:56.741 --> 43:58.408
Honey. What's she done now?

44:00.974 --> 44:01.908
I should go back, Dan.

44:01.941 --> 44:03.741
She didn't mean it,
she's just desperate.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.241
Jesus Christ Anna,
you've gotta toughen up.

44:07.474 --> 44:09.341
She's leached off
you her whole life.

44:10.941 --> 44:11.908
No, you're not going back.

44:13.607 --> 44:15.607
We're gonna have a nice
meal, forget all about her.

44:16.674 --> 44:17.441
You know?

44:18.741 --> 44:19.474
You're not responsible.

44:19.507 --> 44:20.308
But I...

44:20.341 --> 44:21.341
No, listen to me.

44:22.275 --> 44:24.375
Just let her stew in her
own juices for the evening. Hmm?

44:25.341 --> 44:26.275
She's doing it to herself.

44:28.474 --> 44:31.341
Hey, you and me. Yeah?
That's all that matters.

47:15.875 --> 47:16.674
Get out of my house!!

47:19.741 --> 47:20.574
GET OUT!!!

47:20.607 --> 47:21.307
Claire.

47:22.541 --> 47:24.274
What the hell are you doing?

47:30.574 --> 47:31.674
Claire! Claire!

48:08.441 --> 48:09.808
This is the best
place for her right?

48:11.541 --> 48:13.507
I know Roy. It doesn't
make it any easier.

48:13.541 --> 48:14.474
I know.

48:15.009 --> 48:16.307
So sorry
to keep you waiting.

48:17.076 --> 48:18.741
Mrs. Tate,
George Medhurst.

48:19.274 --> 48:20.507
Nice to meet you.

48:20.541 --> 48:23.975
So basically, the results of the
MRI scan show that there are

48:24.009 --> 48:26.875
absolutely no obvious
abnormalities with the brain.

48:27.142 --> 48:28.875
Ahh, that's a good thing right?

48:29.340 --> 48:32.407
However, she has been
extremely distraught.

48:33.142 --> 48:35.541
We think we've got the seizures
under control, she hasn't had

48:35.574 --> 48:37.340
another one since she came
in last night.

48:38.674 --> 48:39.975
So, where do we go from here?

48:40.009 --> 48:43.307
Well, I would like to
get her on a DOLS.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.441
A deprivation
of liberties.

48:45.474 --> 48:47.708
So there are some bits of
paperwork that I'd like you to

48:49.474 --> 48:51.842
look at and consent forms
that you need to sign

48:51.875 --> 48:52.775
in your own time.

48:52.809 --> 48:53.741
Mm hmm, certainly.

48:55.541 --> 48:56.641
Can we see her?

48:56.674 --> 49:01.340
Um, I think you'll find her
extremely unresponsive.

49:03.009 --> 49:04.741
She's on a drug
called Clozapine,

49:06.407 --> 49:08.307
which brings on
extreme exhaustion.

49:09.009 --> 49:11.574
She's basically just gonna be
sleeping all day,

49:11.607 --> 49:14.407
whilst being
very closely monitored.

49:14.441 --> 49:17.307
Listen, if you want to
just drop her things off,

49:17.641 --> 49:20.641
she couldn't be in a
better place. Okay?

49:23.340 --> 49:24.240
Thank you, doctor.

50:01.474 --> 50:02.407
Oh my baby.

50:39.340 --> 50:39.909
I brought your teddy.

51:03.441 --> 51:04.942
I'm going to
read you a little story.

51:07.340 --> 51:09.307
He had created the Earth

51:09.340 --> 51:12.875
and the heavens and they
were beautiful.

51:12.909 --> 51:15.942
The earth was a huge garden,
fruitful in its bounty,

51:17.374 --> 51:19.507
but he was lonely and
longed to have

51:19.541 --> 51:20.875
someone to share it with.

51:21.942 --> 51:24.407
So one day, he created a man

51:24.441 --> 51:28.307
from dust and named him Adam.

51:28.340 --> 51:31.975
And so that the man too was not
alone he created a woman,

51:32.008 --> 51:35.340
also from the dust, as
his companion.

51:36.141 --> 51:39.340
And the creator
called her Lilith.

51:40.974 --> 51:42.709
When the creator
ordered that

51:42.742 --> 51:45.507
the woman lie with the man
she refused,

51:45.541 --> 51:48.574
and the creator felt that
as an insult

51:48.608 --> 51:49.942
as he had given her life.

51:50.407 --> 51:55.608
He cast her out from the garden,
scorned for an eternity.

51:56.407 --> 52:00.608
So this time, the creator
took a rib from Adam

52:00.642 --> 52:03.340
and fashioned
another woman.

52:20.474 --> 52:23.441
In times of fear
and darkness,

52:23.474 --> 52:25.541
it reminds us of the
Lord's power.

52:29.374 --> 52:30.974
Could you come and see her?

52:32.642 --> 52:34.541
Her Father may not
want me to see her.

52:34.575 --> 52:36.307
This is not about them.

52:36.340 --> 52:38.608
Please? Please come and see her?

52:40.407 --> 52:42.974
But she must accept the Lord,

52:43.008 --> 52:45.240
for him to take a
step towards her.

52:47.575 --> 52:48.875
Anna. Are you alright?

52:48.908 --> 52:51.842
I'm
sorry. I have to go.

53:20.474 --> 53:21.441
There's someone in here!

53:52.675 --> 53:54.207
Are you gonna tell Dan?

53:56.008 --> 53:56.974
I dunno.

54:00.874 --> 54:01.775
I wonder if it's a boy.

54:04.508 --> 54:05.307
Sorry?

54:06.908 --> 54:08.709
Just thinking out loud,

54:08.742 --> 54:10.742
trying to work out why
she made me attack you.

54:12.742 --> 54:15.374
Who Claire? Honestly
who do you think

54:15.407 --> 54:17.240
made any of this happen
other than you?

54:23.642 --> 54:25.207
This is way too much,
I can't take it.

54:26.542 --> 54:28.407
You tried to stab me Claire.

54:28.442 --> 54:30.340
No! It wasn't you, it was her!

54:33.608 --> 54:35.274
I need some time away from this,
I'm sorry.

54:46.274 --> 54:48.274
Come on sweetheart, It's time
for your medication.

58:24.674 --> 58:26.341
How close were
you to your grandmother?

58:28.041 --> 58:29.275
Nana Abigail?

58:29.641 --> 58:32.408
Yeah, I'd pop in now and then,

58:32.442 --> 58:34.574
but she preferred to be
on her own.

58:34.607 --> 58:35.674
To be honest her mind had

58:35.708 --> 58:37.941
already started going by the
time we were teenagers.

58:38.542 --> 58:40.275
I knew Abigail
from the village.

58:41.874 --> 58:44.241
In many ways, I
saw her as my opponent.

58:46.008 --> 58:49.774
She was involved in some pretty
unchristian practices.

58:51.541 --> 58:52.741
They say her mother
was the same.

58:57.841 --> 59:01.442
I knew there was a fire
when she was younger.

59:01.874 --> 59:03.808
I believe she lost
her two brothers.

59:04.808 --> 59:08.841
It's the family history that
makes me more inclined

59:08.874 --> 59:11.442
to believe that what
Claire is experiencing

59:11.475 --> 59:13.275
is something out of the
ordinary.

59:14.874 --> 59:18.874
Abigail once
showed me... masks,

59:20.808 --> 59:22.874
that Dorothy made
after her sons died.

59:25.341 --> 59:26.908
She referred to
them as her family.

59:30.275 --> 59:31.908
She must have been
severely traumatised.

59:38.941 --> 59:42.442
If you let the devil
into your life,

59:42.475 --> 59:44.808
you have to fight to
get back to God.

59:47.008 --> 59:50.741
I believe that Claire is the
victim of Abigail's dabbling.

59:54.607 --> 59:57.341
We were never allowed to speak
about this with Nana.

59:58.208 --> 01:00:01.442
Mum and Dad... Well, Mum really,
was militant with her.

01:00:03.008 --> 01:00:04.908
We need to see Claire
as soon as possible.

01:00:05.574 --> 01:00:06.974
She must be prepared

01:00:07.008 --> 01:00:09.408
to let me help her find a
way back to God.

01:00:09.442 --> 01:00:10.408
But does that matter?

01:00:10.442 --> 01:00:12.808
Can we not just do
something for her anyway?

01:00:13.474 --> 01:00:14.241
Please.

01:00:23.908 --> 01:00:25.808
How did it all go
with the Padre?

01:00:26.674 --> 01:00:31.874
Um, yeah. He called my dead
grandmother a witch.

01:00:34.308 --> 01:00:35.908
I don't know Dan, it was odd.

01:00:38.641 --> 01:00:39.741
You know what
I think don't you?

01:00:40.607 --> 01:00:41.674
No. What?

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:45.208
I think that you
should move in with me.

01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:48.741
I kinda got used to having
the whole house to ourselves.

01:00:50.741 --> 01:00:51.674
That's sweet.

01:00:52.708 --> 01:00:53.741
But...

01:00:53.774 --> 01:00:55.441
With everything that's
going on with Claire,

01:00:55.474 --> 01:00:56.574
can we just put this
conversation

01:00:56.607 --> 01:00:57.607
on hold for a
couple of days?

01:00:57.641 --> 01:01:00.341
Oh come on. She's in the
best place now, right?

01:01:00.841 --> 01:01:03.008
Jesus, Dan.

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:04.741
Look, just let the
doctors do their thing.

01:01:05.341 --> 01:01:06.774
Come on, there's a
glass of wine

01:01:06.808 --> 01:01:07.874
then head back to
mine yeah?

01:01:16.008 --> 01:01:19.674
I wanna go to bed.
I'm knackered Dan.

01:01:48.474 --> 01:01:49.741
Why you assing
about in the dark?

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:52.874
And why is there
Chardonnay all over the floor?

01:01:57.507 --> 01:01:58.374
Well?

01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:03.741
I was getting wine.
I dropped the bottle.

01:02:04.908 --> 01:02:05.708
And?

01:02:06.275 --> 01:02:07.407
And what? That's what happened.

01:02:08.874 --> 01:02:09.607
Are you alright Dan?

01:04:12.975 --> 01:04:14.808
Wake up!

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.842
Claire? Can
you hear me? Claire?

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:54.975
You've just had
a nightmare sweetheart.

01:06:57.674 --> 01:06:58.975
I'm sorry.

01:06:59.009 --> 01:07:01.709
Oh, I'm looking for my
parishioner Claire Tate.

01:07:01.742 --> 01:07:04.307
I'm Father John O'Shea.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.909
Hi, nice
to meet you. Umm...

01:07:05.942 --> 01:07:09.607
I'm really sorry but
Claire is just not up for

01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:10.909
receiving visitors at
the moment.

01:07:10.942 --> 01:07:11.842
Oh?

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:13.441
She had a very
restless night and

01:07:13.474 --> 01:07:17.340
she's highly sedated
today so, I'm sorry.

01:07:17.374 --> 01:07:18.607
Oh, could I come back later

01:07:18.641 --> 01:07:20.641
perhaps after she's had
some rest?

01:07:20.675 --> 01:07:22.842
Maybe. Umm. We are
going to be monitoring Claire

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:24.541
very, very closely over the
next few days.

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:27.574
Her family are very
keen that I see her.

01:07:27.607 --> 01:07:32.274
Yes, but she's highly delusional
so maybe you could come back

01:07:32.307 --> 01:07:33.742
in a day or two? Is that okay?

01:07:33.775 --> 01:07:35.742
Has she mentioned
her visions, Doctor?

01:07:38.775 --> 01:07:41.441
Yes, she has, she's
said a lot of things.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:46.374
But I believe that allowing
you into see her now,

01:07:46.407 --> 01:07:49.008
A very vulnerable, a very
suggestive young woman,

01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:51.474
I believe that, would be
perilous.

01:07:51.507 --> 01:07:52.875
You're not a religious
man, are you Doctor?

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:55.975
I believe there's a
time for faith,

01:07:56.008 --> 01:07:57.709
but this is a time for
medicine,

01:07:57.742 --> 01:07:59.775
and luckily, the modern
world agrees with me.

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:02.909
Medicine is a kind of faith and
you're behaving like a zealot.

01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:04.541
So you think I should be
treating Claire

01:08:04.574 --> 01:08:05.541
with Christian prayer,

01:08:05.574 --> 01:08:06.675
rather than anti-psychotic
drugs? Is that it?

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:09.642
Not everything can be
explained by science, Doctor.

01:08:09.675 --> 01:08:10.742
Ok.

01:08:10.775 --> 01:08:11.875
I wouldn't expect
you to understand that.

01:08:20.608 --> 01:08:21.841
Where were ya?

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:24.374
I was asleep. I knew it though.

01:08:26.441 --> 01:08:29.608
It's this house. We
can't be in this house.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.175
Fuck off to work, then Dan, and
give me my fucking house back!

01:08:36.908 --> 01:08:38.875
Fine. Fine!

01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:26.675
Leave us alone.

01:10:27.809 --> 01:10:28.842
Leave us alone!

01:10:29.974 --> 01:10:33.374
Leave us alone! Leave us alone!

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:46.575
Put her on the bed.

01:10:46.608 --> 01:10:49.274
Anna can't see her like
I can. She'll get Anna next.

01:11:51.475 --> 01:11:52.374
Anna.

01:11:55.608 --> 01:11:56.374
Anna, are you...?

01:11:57.941 --> 01:12:00.240
What's going on? Are you
sleeping? What is this?

01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:03.374
What do you want me to do Anna?

01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:04.908
Do you want me to call the
doctor or what?

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.207
Anna, we can't stay
in this house, hon.

01:12:28.941 --> 01:12:30.741
Fuck this! I've
gotta go. I'm sorry.

01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:54.874
I think it's time for
your bed bath now.

01:12:57.475 --> 01:12:59.874
Don't you dare fucking touch me.

01:13:59.408 --> 01:14:04.375
She asked Lilith
to get rid of her husband.

01:14:49.341 --> 01:14:50.375
Now then...

01:14:51.008 --> 01:14:52.542
This one will be
called...

01:14:54.008 --> 01:14:55.475
Father.

01:14:58.841 --> 01:15:03.841
And this one
will be called...

01:15:05.308 --> 01:15:05.874
Edward.

01:15:08.475 --> 01:15:13.475
My beautiful,
beautiful Edward.

01:15:36.275 --> 01:15:37.908
We've been
trying to tell you.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:40.941
It's going to
happen again.

01:15:52.008 --> 01:15:54.308
She's
not strong like you.

01:16:05.641 --> 01:16:06.774
Oh God!

01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:11.974
Visiting time
is over, Father.

01:16:29.308 --> 01:16:30.641
Lilith!

01:16:31.341 --> 01:16:32.841
Lilith!

01:16:35.874 --> 01:16:37.408
Can we get
some help here please?

01:16:37.442 --> 01:16:38.607
Don't you come near me.

01:16:39.908 --> 01:16:40.841
Give me the glass Claire.

01:16:40.874 --> 01:16:42.241
No! Lilith!

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.341
This is
what you want is it?

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:55.341
Claire I can help you.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.574
Back! Or so help me
God, I'll cut my throat.

01:16:58.841 --> 01:16:59.941
Is this what you want?

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:04.275
You want me dead so
you can have Anna and her baby.

01:17:05.008 --> 01:17:08.474
Well I won't do
it! You're stuck with me.

01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:35.741
Claire!

01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:55.208
Hi.

01:17:56.407 --> 01:17:57.708
Hey.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:00.308
You need anything?

01:18:00.808 --> 01:18:01.774
Dan!

01:18:04.541 --> 01:18:05.407
I'm fine.

01:18:12.341 --> 01:18:16.708
It was just a long absence.
But I'm back now.

01:18:25.474 --> 01:18:29.241
She...
Didn't even notice.

01:18:34.908 --> 01:18:35.941
Daniel! Are you deaf?

01:18:36.607 --> 01:18:39.607
Sorry honey. What
do you need? Hm?

01:18:40.741 --> 01:18:42.241
Well, this one's hungry.

01:18:43.941 --> 01:18:45.275
So is this one.

01:19:48.908 --> 01:19:51.774
Fuck you. I've won.

01:20:01.408 --> 01:20:06.408
