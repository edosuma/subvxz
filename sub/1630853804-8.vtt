WEBVTT

00:05.965 --> 00:07.967
[wind whistling]

00:11.011 --> 00:13.639
[Juniper] 10-34, over.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.850
That's a 10-34. Over.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.270
Come on. Fuck.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.397
Who are you talking to?

00:22.398 --> 00:24.358
We're ready to go.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.779
[Juniper] Come on.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.364
[Tiff] Lady, we're out of time.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.991
Who are you calling?

00:32.074 --> 00:34.827
Trying to send a distress signal
to my STF contact.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.580
Hold up, you can do that
on a walkie?

00:37.663 --> 00:40.958
Yeah, it's, uh
the STF uses paired walkie sets

00:41.041 --> 00:42.376
to communicate across time.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.295
- Shut up.
- The Old Watch can't track

00:44.378 --> 00:45.921
analog signals,
so they can't listen in

00:46.005 --> 00:48.007
on what you're saying
over these old things.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.718
I can only communicate with
the other walkie in this set.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.096
Durane has the other one.
He recruited me in '94.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.891
[exhales]
But he's not responding.

01:02.354 --> 01:06.692
TRC-218 two-watt three-channel
handheld CB receiver

01:06.776 --> 01:08.235
with Channel 30 crystals.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.945
Heck and Naldo stole
the other one in my set

01:10.029 --> 01:12.031
on Hell Day in 1988.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.578
Heck and Naldo have the matching
unit to this one in 1988.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.997
- Are you sure?
- Stole it right off my friend.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.832
- You're sure?
- Mm.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.502
Because if what
you're saying is true...

01:28.422 --> 01:30.883
10-34.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.844
Anyone out there?
Anyone hear my voice, come back.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.180
10-34.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.349
[radio crackling]

01:39.683 --> 01:40.893
[Heck distorted] One four...

01:40.976 --> 01:42.311
Oh, shit!

01:42.394 --> 01:43.771
That's them.
That's Heck and Naldo.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.107
Yes, yes, I can hear you.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.776
- You're coming through.
- It is them.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.319
[Erin] Tell them it's us,
the girls they stole

01:50.402 --> 01:51.654
- the walkie from.
- Screw that. Tell them to get

01:51.737 --> 01:53.405
their future butts
here already, please.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.741
Guys, we're going home.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.785
[Juniper] Put a team together
and get here ASAP.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.537
We can evacuate
the civilians and maybe

01:59.620 --> 02:01.622
even get the drop
on these bastards.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.624
If these STF freaks
win this dumb war,

02:03.707 --> 02:05.793
maybe all of our futures change.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.962
Adult you never gets
in that robot.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.922
KJ never gets that perm.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.091
Ah-ha-ha...

02:12.174 --> 02:14.093
Tiffany probably
still goes to the same

02:14.176 --> 02:15.970
- fancy college, though.
- Mm-hmm.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.057
Future's so bright, right?

02:21.225 --> 02:22.393
Exactly.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.811
[laughs softly]

02:23.894 --> 02:25.521
[Juniper] Do you read me?

02:25.604 --> 02:27.147
Come on, let's get a move on.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.859
Chop, chop, lady.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.278
Do you read me?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.947
I'm just gonna give them
the 1999 folding coordinates

02:35.030 --> 02:37.283
- and keep repeating.
- Good idea.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.371
Okay. Uh... this one right here.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.499
4-1-6-6.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.921
4-1-6-6.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.842
[Mac] Hey, assclowns,

02:54.925 --> 02:56.677
if you can hear this, get ready,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.762
'cause we're coming
to get our shit back.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.476
That was me.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.522
What?

03:08.606 --> 03:10.482
No.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.067
It was you on Hell Day.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.736
We heard you.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.905
It was your voice.
We heard your message.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.490
What do you mean?

03:18.574 --> 03:19.617
T-That's impossible.
You weren't...

03:19.700 --> 03:20.868
This has already happened.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.787
Oh, my God, all of this
has already happened

03:23.871 --> 03:25.289
and nothing changed.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.416
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

03:27.499 --> 03:29.668
What the fuck is going on

03:29.752 --> 03:32.171
is that nobody's
going anywhere, Larry.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.006
[Tiff] They got our message
in '88.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.967
We heard it, too.
Heck and Naldo got the message,

03:37.051 --> 03:38.552
and they still die.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.387
And we can't get home.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.181
[adult Tiff] It's a time loop.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.475
A predestination paradox.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.644
Events in the future
trigger events in the past

03:46.727 --> 03:50.064
causing them to repeat
over and over again.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.024
And everything that's happened

03:52.107 --> 03:54.818
and everything
that's going to happen,

03:54.902 --> 03:57.071
there is no changing it.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.826
[Erin] No.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.245
M-Maybe we can take it back.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.872
Tell Heck and Naldo to abort.

04:06.956 --> 04:10.042
Tell them to find another way.
Tell them it doesn't work.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.675
Please... Please,
can you hear me?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.093
Please, you're gonna die.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.011
Abort, abort.
You're gonna die.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.389
You are going to die.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.349
Hey, look at me. Mac.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.643
We are gonna figure this out.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.270
How?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.571
[Tiff] Mac!

04:41.657 --> 04:43.701
Where's she going?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.620
Maybe just give her a minute.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.038
I'm afraid we don't
have a minute.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.916
[crackling]

04:52.751 --> 04:55.421
[thunder rumbling]

04:55.504 --> 04:57.214
They're coming.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.733
[KJ] Mac?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.234
Where are you?
They're waiting.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.944
[goat bleats]

05:21.280 --> 05:24.158
Mac, we got to get out of here.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.451
You all right?

05:36.003 --> 05:40.090
[Mac] Thanks for being so...

05:40.174 --> 05:44.678
I don't know, just thank you
for being how you are, I guess.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.475
You all right?

05:56.899 --> 05:59.568
I'm... I'm just gonna...

05:59.651 --> 06:01.779
I'm just going
to check if there's

06:01.862 --> 06:05.365
any food or stuff
or supplies or something,

06:05.449 --> 06:07.659
in the house for us to take.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.536
No, you stay here,
take a load off.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.829
- Mac.
- It's fine.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.627
[quietly] Goddamn it.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.672
- Fuck!
- [MeeMaw laughing]

06:24.218 --> 06:26.720
I'm sorry about that. Um...

06:26.804 --> 06:28.806
I didn't realize
you were in here.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.891
Your friend is funny.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.893
[laughing]

06:33.894 --> 06:35.229
[footsteps approaching]

06:40.234 --> 06:42.027
I wouldn't.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.908
[thunder rumbles]

06:50.661 --> 06:52.079
Hey, we're ready to go.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.664
When I was your age, that silo

06:53.747 --> 06:55.999
was filled to the roof
with grain.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.168
Afraid I'm not much of a farmer.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.212
Guess I don't end up
being much of anything.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.421
[Erin] As riveting
as that is, Larry,

07:01.505 --> 07:04.675
we have to get out
of here right now.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.010
You said so yourself.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.346
I can't. My MeeMaw.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.014
We can't let them catch you.
You know too much.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.516
[chuckles]

07:12.599 --> 07:14.935
That's funny, 'cause I feel like
I don't know a fucking thing.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.229
Sorry, but you've seen
how MeeMaw is.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.314
She can't be on the run
in her condition.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.109
You might not understand this,
but I have no choice.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.361
I have to take care
of her, okay?

07:24.444 --> 07:28.323
You're not the only one
with a family, Larry.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.659
And if you really care about
your meemaw, get in the car,

07:30.742 --> 07:34.037
survive this, and find a way
to get back to her.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.373
You can't do her
much good otherwise.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.716
Mac, look, I'm sorry.
Okay? I just, I...

07:47.134 --> 07:49.386
KJ Brandman.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.346
What are you going
to do with us?

07:54.308 --> 07:57.019
I think maybe
we got it wrong, KJ.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.147
I think she just wants to
send us home, believe it or not.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.400
I'm going with not.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.028
If you put us back,

08:06.111 --> 08:07.863
we really won't
remember any of this?

08:07.946 --> 08:10.449
- Mac.
- [Prioress] That's
the trade-off.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.702
I just need the exact date
you came from.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.037
We're not telling you.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.371
November 1st, 1988.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.756
I'm just tired.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.181
I just want to go back home,

08:34.264 --> 08:38.810
have a decent smoke
and sleep in my shitty bed.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.566
And you, you should just
forget about all of this.

08:44.650 --> 08:49.112
Have a fan-fucking-tastic time
at your bat mitzvah.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.827
You'll be back
in your bed in no time.

08:55.911 --> 08:59.206
There's just someone
who wants to meet you first.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.047
[thunder crashes]

09:15.430 --> 09:17.432
[♪ Bon Jovi: "Bad Medicine"]

09:26.108 --> 09:28.068
- [music stops]
- [Grand Father] Hello.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.195
[chuckles]

09:30.279 --> 09:32.698
You kids seem a little on edge.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.868
The vibes in here
are tense right now.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.705
[laughs] Is it Prioress?

09:39.788 --> 09:41.248
Eh, she can be
a little too much,

09:41.331 --> 09:43.417
but you know what?
She means well.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.253
And plus, she got you here
safe and sound, so...

09:46.336 --> 09:48.297
we can all relax
a little bit, right?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.173
Let's all take a deep breath.
What do you say, huh?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.426
[inhales sharply]

09:52.509 --> 09:55.012
[sighs]

09:55.095 --> 09:57.055
So, I'm not gonna lie.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.976
You have completely fucked
the Stony Stream timeline,

10:01.059 --> 10:05.272
but here's the good news:
we're gonna fix all of that.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.982
No worries at all.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.068
- By killing us?
- What? [sighs]

10:10.152 --> 10:13.280
Let me guess, this is the one
that killed your brother?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.582
No. No killing.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.460
I was thinking more like
taking you from here,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.837
dropping you back in 1988,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.797
and then erasing
any and all memories

10:30.881 --> 10:32.966
of this nightmare
ever happening.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.344
Come on.
Doesn't that sound good?

10:35.427 --> 10:36.636
- You can really do that?
- Wait,

10:36.720 --> 10:38.805
- can you put us in the future?
- What?

10:38.889 --> 10:40.182
What do you want
with the future?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.017
My friend has cancer.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.603
- And maybe in the future,
there's a cure.
- Christ, Kaje.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.188
[KJ] Is there?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.150
[sighs]

10:52.110 --> 10:53.320
[screeching]

10:55.447 --> 10:57.449
[Tiff] That's a dinosaur.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.578
Get in the car.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.331
This feels like our cue, ladies.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.707
Get in!

11:05.791 --> 11:08.001
Did you make this mix?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.545
- No, my brother did.
- [chuckles] Ah.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.757
[Grand Father] Well, you got
a pretty cool brother.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.801
He's got good taste in music.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.345
Let's, uh, let's listen
a little, huh?

11:19.638 --> 11:21.556
♪ I ain't got a fever ♪

11:21.640 --> 11:23.016
♪ Got a permanent disease...

11:23.100 --> 11:25.811
Ugh. So good.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.021
I remember when this song
came out.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.731
- [laughs]
- [music stops]

11:29.815 --> 11:33.026
Okay, let's think
about your life

11:33.110 --> 11:36.405
like it's your
favorite mixtape, right?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.657
And every moment in your life

11:38.740 --> 11:40.909
is like a different song
in the mix.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.078
Now, what happens if you, uh,

11:43.161 --> 11:45.122
wanted to change
one of the songs...

11:45.205 --> 11:47.833
or, in this case, even better,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.710
record over it
with a different song?

11:51.962 --> 11:54.047
- Hey, easy with that.
- [Grand Father] Hang on,
hang on.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.674
I'm trying to make
a point. Okay.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.134
Now let's listen.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.343
[song plays]

11:58.427 --> 11:59.761
[Mac on tape] Hey,
easy with that.

11:59.845 --> 12:00.762
[Grand Father] It's
a little hard

12:00.846 --> 12:02.556
to hear over the headphones,

12:02.639 --> 12:04.516
but believe me when I say

12:04.599 --> 12:09.229
the sound quality has degraded
each and every time

12:09.312 --> 12:11.648

12:11.731 --> 12:14.276
Nothing is as good

12:14.359 --> 12:16.027

Now,

12:18.113 --> 12:19.990
the STF--

12:20.073 --> 12:23.076
those little rascals--
they're out there

12:23.160 --> 12:26.246

the mixtape of time

12:26.329 --> 12:30.709
for the better by making
all the bad stuff go away.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.127
But in actuality,

12:32.210 --> 12:34.754
- what they're doing...
- [music plays]

12:34.838 --> 12:37.299
...is recording over
the original track

12:37.382 --> 12:39.384
with all their own songs.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.637
If you keep doing it,
over and over...

12:44.389 --> 12:46.391
...eventually,

12:46.475 --> 12:50.228
the timeline just unravels.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.903
And in its weakened state,
after all the recording

12:57.986 --> 13:01.531
and the rerecording,
guess what happens next?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.077

that's why the Old Watch

Always.

Look, I'm sorry, kid.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.521

to remember cancer,

13:32.604 --> 13:34.773

cold card to catch,

13:34.856 --> 13:37.567

at the Old Watch,

13:37.651 --> 13:40.028
"Your time is your time."

Can I put in an order to have
my brain extra scrubbed?

Really? If you don't,
then who does?

You got, like,
a boss or something?

I... No.
No, I don't have a boss.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.690
What? No. Everything
just happens for a reason.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.108
I don't believe that.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.734
I believe that people say that

16:24.818 --> 16:27.153
to absolve themselves
of responsibility.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.072
But we make choices.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.742
And if you can stop
bad things from happening,
