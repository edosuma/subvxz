WEBVTT

00:05.965 --> 00:07.967
[wind whistling]

00:11.011 --> 00:13.639
[Juniper] 10-34, over.

00:13.723 --> 00:15.850
That's a 10-34. Over.

00:16.892 --> 00:19.270
Come on. Fuck.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.397
Who are you talking to?

00:22.398 --> 00:24.358
We're ready to go.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.779
[Juniper] Come on.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.364
[Tiff] Lady, we're out of time.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.991
Who are you calling?

00:32.074 --> 00:34.827
Trying to send a distress signal
to my STF contact.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.580
Hold up, you can do that
on a walkie?

00:37.663 --> 00:40.958
Yeah, it's, uh
the STF uses paired walkie sets

00:41.041 --> 00:42.376
to communicate across time.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.295
- Shut up.
- The Old Watch can't track

00:44.378 --> 00:45.921
analog signals,
so they can't listen in

00:46.005 --> 00:48.007
on what you're saying
over these old things.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.718
I can only communicate with
the other walkie in this set.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.096
Durane has the other one.
He recruited me in '94.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.891
[exhales]
But he's not responding.

01:02.354 --> 01:06.692
TRC-218 two-watt three-channel
handheld CB receiver

01:06.776 --> 01:08.235
with Channel 30 crystals.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.945
Heck and Naldo stole
the other one in my set

01:10.029 --> 01:12.031
on Hell Day in 1988.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.578
Heck and Naldo have the matching
unit to this one in 1988.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.997
- Are you sure?
- Stole it right off my friend.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.832
- You're sure?
- Mm.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.502
Because if what
you're saying is true...

01:28.422 --> 01:30.883
10-34.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.844
Anyone out there?
Anyone hear my voice, come back.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.180
10-34.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.349
[radio crackling]

01:39.683 --> 01:40.893
[Heck distorted] One four...

01:40.976 --> 01:42.311
Oh, shit!

01:42.394 --> 01:43.771
That's them.
That's Heck and Naldo.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.107
Yes, yes, I can hear you.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.776
- You're coming through.
- It is them.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.319
[Erin] Tell them it's us,
the girls they stole

01:50.402 --> 01:51.654
- the walkie from.
- Screw that. Tell them to get

01:51.737 --> 01:53.405
their future butts
here already, please.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.741
Guys, we're going home.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.785
[Juniper] Put a team together
and get here ASAP.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.537
We can evacuate
the civilians and maybe

01:59.620 --> 02:01.622
even get the drop
on these bastards.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.624
If these STF freaks
win this dumb war,

02:03.707 --> 02:05.793
maybe all of our futures change.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.962
Adult you never gets
in that robot.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.922
KJ never gets that perm.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.091
Ah-ha-ha...

02:12.174 --> 02:14.093
Tiffany probably
still goes to the same

02:14.176 --> 02:15.970
- fancy college, though.
- Mm-hmm.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.057
Future's so bright, right?

02:21.225 --> 02:22.393
Exactly.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.811
[laughs softly]

02:23.894 --> 02:25.521
[Juniper] Do you read me?

02:25.604 --> 02:27.147
Come on, let's get a move on.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.859
Chop, chop, lady.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.278
Do you read me?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.947
I'm just gonna give them
the 1999 folding coordinates

02:35.030 --> 02:37.283
- and keep repeating.
- Good idea.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.371
Okay. Uh... this one right here.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.499
4-1-6-6.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.921
4-1-6-6.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.842
[Mac] Hey, assclowns,

02:54.925 --> 02:56.677
if you can hear this, get ready,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.762
'cause we're coming
to get our shit back.

03:02.725 --> 03:04.476
That was me.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.522
What?

03:08.606 --> 03:10.482
No.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.067
It was you on Hell Day.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.736
We heard you.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.905
It was your voice.
We heard your message.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.490
What do you mean?

03:18.574 --> 03:19.617
T-That's impossible.
You weren't...

03:19.700 --> 03:20.868
This has already happened.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.787
Oh, my God, all of this
has already happened

03:23.871 --> 03:25.289
and nothing changed.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.416
Will somebody please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

03:27.499 --> 03:29.668
What the fuck is going on

03:29.752 --> 03:32.171
is that nobody's
going anywhere, Larry.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.006
[Tiff] They got our message
in '88.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.967
We heard it, too.
Heck and Naldo got the message,

03:37.051 --> 03:38.552
and they still die.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.387
And we can't get home.

03:40.471 --> 03:42.181
[adult Tiff] It's a time loop.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.475
A predestination paradox.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.644
Events in the future
trigger events in the past

03:46.727 --> 03:50.064
causing them to repeat
over and over again.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.024
And everything that's happened

03:52.107 --> 03:54.818
and everything
that's going to happen,

03:54.902 --> 03:57.071
there is no changing it.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.826
[Erin] No.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.245
M-Maybe we can take it back.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.872
Tell Heck and Naldo to abort.

04:06.956 --> 04:10.042
Tell them to find another way.
Tell them it doesn't work.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.675
Please... Please,
can you hear me?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.093
Please, you're gonna die.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.011
Abort, abort.
You're gonna die.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.389
You are going to die.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.349
Hey, look at me. Mac.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.643
We are gonna figure this out.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.270
How?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.571
[Tiff] Mac!

04:41.657 --> 04:43.701
Where's she going?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.620
Maybe just give her a minute.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.038
I'm afraid we don't
have a minute.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.916
[crackling]

04:52.751 --> 04:55.421
[thunder rumbling]

04:55.504 --> 04:57.214
They're coming.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.733
[KJ] Mac?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.234
Where are you?
They're waiting.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.944
[goat bleats]

05:21.280 --> 05:24.158
Mac, we got to get out of here.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.451
You all right?

05:36.003 --> 05:40.090
[Mac] Thanks for being so...

05:40.174 --> 05:44.678
I don't know, just thank you
for being how you are, I guess.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.475
You all right?

05:56.899 --> 05:59.568
I'm... I'm just gonna...

05:59.651 --> 06:01.779
I'm just going
to check if there's

06:01.862 --> 06:05.365
any food or stuff
or supplies or something,

06:05.449 --> 06:07.659
in the house for us to take.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.536
No, you stay here,
take a load off.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.829
- Mac.
- It's fine.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.627
[quietly] Goddamn it.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.672
- Fuck!
- [MeeMaw laughing]

06:24.218 --> 06:26.720
I'm sorry about that. Um...

06:26.804 --> 06:28.806
I didn't realize
you were in here.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.891
Your friend is funny.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.893
[laughing]

06:33.894 --> 06:35.229
[footsteps approaching]

06:40.234 --> 06:42.027
I wouldn't.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.908
[thunder rumbles]

06:50.661 --> 06:52.079
Hey, we're ready to go.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.664
When I was your age, that silo

06:53.747 --> 06:55.999
was filled to the roof
with grain.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.168
Afraid I'm not much of a farmer.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.212
Guess I don't end up
being much of anything.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.421
[Erin] As riveting
as that is, Larry,

07:01.505 --> 07:04.675
we have to get out
of here right now.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.010
You said so yourself.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.346
I can't. My MeeMaw.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.014
We can't let them catch you.
You know too much.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.516
[chuckles]

07:12.599 --> 07:14.935
That's funny, 'cause I feel like
I don't know a fucking thing.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.229
Sorry, but you've seen
how MeeMaw is.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.314
She can't be on the run
in her condition.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.109
You might not understand this,
but I have no choice.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.361
I have to take care
of her, okay?

07:24.444 --> 07:28.323
You're not the only one
with a family, Larry.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.659
And if you really care about
your meemaw, get in the car,

07:30.742 --> 07:34.037
survive this, and find a way
to get back to her.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.373
You can't do her
much good otherwise.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.716
Mac, look, I'm sorry.
Okay? I just, I...

07:47.134 --> 07:49.386
KJ Brandman.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.346
What are you going
to do with us?

07:54.308 --> 07:57.019
I think maybe
we got it wrong, KJ.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.147
I think she just wants to
send us home, believe it or not.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.400
I'm going with not.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.028
If you put us back,

08:06.111 --> 08:07.863
we really won't
remember any of this?

08:07.946 --> 08:10.449
- Mac.
- [Prioress] That's
the trade-off.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.702
I just need the exact date
you came from.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.037
We're not telling you.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.371
November 1st, 1988.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.756
I'm just tired.

08:31.303 --> 08:34.181
I just want to go back home,

08:34.264 --> 08:38.810
have a decent smoke
and sleep in my shitty bed.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.566
And you, you should just
forget about all of this.

08:44.650 --> 08:49.112
Have a fan-fucking-tastic time
at your bat mitzvah.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.827
You'll be back
in your bed in no time.

08:55.911 --> 08:59.206
There's just someone
who wants to meet you first.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.047
[thunder crashes]

09:15.430 --> 09:17.432
[â™ª Bon Jovi: "Bad Medicine"]

09:26.108 --> 09:28.068
- [music stops]
- [Grand Father] Hello.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.195
[chuckles]

09:30.279 --> 09:32.698
You kids seem a little on edge.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.868
The vibes in here
are tense right now.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.705
[laughs] Is it Prioress?

09:39.788 --> 09:41.248
Eh, she can be
a little too much,

09:41.331 --> 09:43.417
but you know what?
She means well.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.253
And plus, she got you here
safe and sound, so...

09:46.336 --> 09:48.297
we can all relax
a little bit, right?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.173
Let's all take a deep breath.
What do you say, huh?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.426
[inhales sharply]

09:52.509 --> 09:55.012
[sighs]

09:55.095 --> 09:57.055
So, I'm not gonna lie.

09:57.139 --> 10:00.976
You have completely fucked
the Stony Stream timeline,

10:01.059 --> 10:05.272
but here's the good news:
we're gonna fix all of that.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.982
No worries at all.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.068
- By killing us?
- What? [sighs]

10:10.152 --> 10:13.280
Let me guess, this is the one
that killed your brother?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.582
No. No killing.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.460
I was thinking more like
taking you from here,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.837
dropping you back in 1988,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.797
and then erasing
any and all memories

10:30.881 --> 10:32.966
of this nightmare
ever happening.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.344
Come on.
Doesn't that sound good?

10:35.427 --> 10:36.636
- You can really do that?
- Wait,

10:36.720 --> 10:38.805
- can you put us in the future?
- What?

10:38.889 --> 10:40.182
What do you want
with the future?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.017
My friend has cancer.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.603
- And maybe in the future,
there's a cure.
- Christ, Kaje.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.188
[KJ] Is there?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.150
[sighs]

10:52.110 --> 10:53.320
[screeching]

10:55.447 --> 10:57.449
[Tiff] That's a dinosaur.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.578
Get in the car.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.331
This feels like our cue, ladies.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.707
Get in!

11:05.791 --> 11:08.001
Did you make this mix?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.545
- No, my brother did.
- [chuckles] Ah.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.757
[Grand Father] Well, you got
a pretty cool brother.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.801
He's got good taste in music.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.345
Let's, uh, let's listen
a little, huh?

11:19.638 --> 11:21.556
â™ª I ain't got a fever â™ª

11:21.640 --> 11:23.016
â™ª Got a permanent disease...

11:23.100 --> 11:25.811
Ugh. So good.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.021
I remember when this song
came out.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.731
- [laughs]
- [music stops]

11:29.815 --> 11:33.026
Okay, let's think
about your life

11:33.110 --> 11:36.405
like it's your
favorite mixtape, right?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.657
And every moment in your life

11:38.740 --> 11:40.909
is like a different song
in the mix.

11:40.992 --> 11:43.078
Now, what happens if you, uh,

11:43.161 --> 11:45.122
wanted to change
one of the songs...

11:45.205 --> 11:47.833
or, in this case, even better,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.710
record over it
with a different song?

11:51.962 --> 11:54.047
- Hey, easy with that.
- [Grand Father] Hang on,
hang on.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.674
I'm trying to make
a point. Okay.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.134
Now let's listen.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.343
[song plays]

11:58.427 --> 11:59.761
[Mac on tape] Hey,
easy with that.

11:59.845 --> 12:00.762
[Grand Father] It's
a little hard

12:00.846 --> 12:02.556
to hear over the headphones,

12:02.639 --> 12:04.516
but believe me when I say

12:04.599 --> 12:09.229
the sound quality has degraded
each and every time

12:09.312 --> 12:11.648
you record over the tape.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.276
Nothing is as good

12:14.359 --> 12:16.027
as the original.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.029
Now,

12:18.113 --> 12:19.990
the STF--

12:20.073 --> 12:23.076
those little rascals--
they're out there

12:23.160 --> 12:26.246
thinking they're changing
the mixtape of time

12:26.329 --> 12:30.709
for the better by making
all the bad stuff go away.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.127
But in actuality,

12:32.210 --> 12:34.754
- what they're doing...
- [music plays]

12:34.838 --> 12:37.299
...is recording over
the original track

12:37.382 --> 12:39.384
with all their own songs.

12:39.468 --> 12:42.637
If you keep doing it,
over and over...

12:44.389 --> 12:46.391
...eventually,

12:46.475 --> 12:50.228
the timeline just unravels.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.903
And in its weakened state,
after all the recording

12:57.986 --> 13:01.531
and the rerecording,
guess what happens next?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.077
[laughs softly]

13:06.161 --> 13:09.039
Now no one can listen.

13:10.499 --> 13:15.795
This, right here,
is the end of the universe.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.672
[softly] You fucker.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.091
[Grand Father] So,
that's why the Old Watch

13:20.175 --> 13:22.802
has to keep the original
mixtape playing.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.054
Always.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.724
No exceptions.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.310
Look, I'm sorry, kid.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.521
I'm old enough
to remember cancer,

13:32.604 --> 13:34.773
and that's a real
cold card to catch,

13:34.856 --> 13:37.567
but, like we say
at the Old Watch,

13:37.651 --> 13:40.028
"Your time is your time."

13:46.785 --> 13:50.789
Can I put in an order to have
my brain extra scrubbed?

13:50.872 --> 13:53.208
Look, I don't want
to remember any of this.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.919
[Grand Father laughs]

13:56.002 --> 13:57.671
I like you.

13:57.754 --> 14:02.342
I'm gonna order up the deluxe
platinum rinse just for you.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.302
Promise.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.555
Ha. All right.
Great job, everybody.

14:06.638 --> 14:11.268
So, we've got a little bit more
cleanup to do here in '99,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.311
and then we'll drop
you guys back at...

14:13.395 --> 14:14.646
Wait, what-what was
the date again?

14:14.729 --> 14:16.606
[Prioress] November 1st, 1988.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.442
Oh, '88. Are you kidding?

14:19.526 --> 14:22.028
What a great year for music.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.613
Metallica's
...And Justice for All.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.198
Are you guys heavy metal fans?

14:25.282 --> 14:28.326
Lars Ulrich, probably the best
drummer working right now.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.828
- [wings flapping loudly]
- The guy's double bass kicks

14:29.911 --> 14:31.663
are out of control.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.166
[screeching]

14:38.169 --> 14:39.504
Hold on. Slow down, okay?
What do you care

14:39.588 --> 14:40.797
if your mind gets wiped?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.632
[adult Tiff] Are you serious?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.175
You think I want to go back
to my boring life

14:44.259 --> 14:45.802
in fucking Stony Stream
with no memory

14:45.885 --> 14:47.846
of time travel or any of this?

14:51.641 --> 14:53.768
[screeching]

14:56.438 --> 14:57.355
Give me a pen.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.732
Get in the car!

14:58.815 --> 14:59.899
Give me one.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.448
[wings flapping]

15:09.659 --> 15:13.455
You won't remember any of this,
but at least you'll have that.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.501
Now make it real.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.255
Go.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.467
Unbelievable.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.139
Wait!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.183
Wait, hold on!

15:44.486 --> 15:46.988
- [screeches]
- [Grand Father chuckles]

15:48.323 --> 15:49.699
[Grand Father chuckles]

15:49.783 --> 15:51.576
[Grand Father] Ah.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.578
Ladies, meet Tessa.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.373
Tessa, these are our
new friends.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.208
They're a little lost, but we're
gonna get them back home.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.043
Hey, I have a question.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.712
- Yeah?
- Those STF guys
we watched her execute

16:02.796 --> 16:04.756
are from some time, right?

16:04.839 --> 16:06.091
So why is that allowed?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.218
Why doesn't that fuck up
your mixtape?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.719
Look, I don't make the rules.

16:09.803 --> 16:13.973
Really? If you don't,
then who does?

16:14.057 --> 16:16.017
You got, like,
a boss or something?

16:16.101 --> 16:18.228
I... No.
No, I don't have a boss.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.690
What? No. Everything
just happens for a reason.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.108
I don't believe that.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.734
I believe that people say that

16:24.818 --> 16:27.153
to absolve themselves
of responsibility.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.072
But we make choices.

16:29.155 --> 16:32.742
And if you can stop
bad things from happening,

16:32.826 --> 16:35.036
you have to try.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.247
[Grand Father] Look,
I get it. You're nervous.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.791
But trust me,
it's better this way.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.501
[KJ] Better for you, maybe.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.086
[Grand Father] No. No, see,

16:43.169 --> 16:44.713
better for the timeline.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.089
Look, I know this might be
hard for you guys

16:46.172 --> 16:47.382
to wrap your heads around,

16:47.465 --> 16:50.385
but trust me,
that is a privilege.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.683
You know what?
I changed my mind.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.101
Deal's off.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.519
If you're worried
about Ablution,

16:59.602 --> 17:01.146
it doesn't hurt or anything.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.773
You just blink your eyes and...

17:03.857 --> 17:06.359
all the burdens
you're feeling right now...

17:06.443 --> 17:08.027
won't even be a memory.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.362
[Mac] You're not listening.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.489
We're not
fucking doing this, man!

17:12.991 --> 17:14.576
Yeah.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.536
See, I think

17:16.619 --> 17:19.122
you might be laboring
under the delusion

17:19.205 --> 17:21.040
that you have a choice.

17:21.124 --> 17:24.043
Aah, get your hands off me,
you fucking creep!

17:24.961 --> 17:27.005
[roaring]

17:27.088 --> 17:28.256
Let these girls go right now

17:28.339 --> 17:29.591
or I shoot your pet
right in the neck.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not cool, not cool, man!

17:32.093 --> 17:33.136
You're no killer.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.513
[Larry] Maybe not.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.766
But I am a proud member
of the STF Underground.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.768
- Oh, here we go.
- Drop it.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.604
[sighs]

17:42.687 --> 17:43.897
Get the hell over here.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.027
You should probably
get out of here.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.447
Hurry up, hurry up.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.124
[sighs]

18:03.208 --> 18:05.710
You've been sold
a bill of goods, my man.

18:05.794 --> 18:06.836
Bullshit.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.214
What makes you say that, huh?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.591
Because you talked to a couple

18:11.674 --> 18:14.344
of freaky teens
with metal pimples?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.012
Come on, think about it.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.972
Let's all just
take a deep breath,

18:18.056 --> 18:19.974
relax...

18:20.058 --> 18:21.476
you drop that gun.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.186
Come on, what do you say?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.605
I say...

18:25.688 --> 18:28.358
at least I've finally
done something right.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.865
Fine.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.284
Have it your way.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.541
- [screaming]
- [clamoring]

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
[Erin] Larry!

18:51.965 --> 18:54.384
You saw me try
and save him, right?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.637
I-I-I-I legit did not want him
to get chomped.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.974
[groans] Let's go find
the girls.

19:09.858 --> 19:10.859
Did they see where we went?

19:10.942 --> 19:12.026
I don't think so.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.946
That guy had a fucking dinosaur.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.156
Poor Larry.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.575
He didn't deserve that.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.118
[KJ] He saved us.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.912
For a little while at least.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.211
I'm sick.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.922
- What do you mean?
- What?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.510
You can do this, Mac.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.142
It's cancer.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.227
Dylan told me.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.482
Is that true?

19:51.566 --> 19:53.818
Well...

19:53.902 --> 19:55.862
Yeah.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.488
It's true.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.661
Look, in four years,

20:03.745 --> 20:05.580
there's no future me.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.540
[Erin] I don't understand.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.542
You told me that you grew up

20:09.626 --> 20:12.045
to be some kind of vet,
and that you were okay.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.928
I'm so sorry, Mac.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.307
Me, too.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.565
I'm glad you told us.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.781
[Tessa roaring]

20:42.075 --> 20:44.077
So what are we gonna do
if they find us?

20:44.160 --> 20:46.537
[Erin] You mean
when they find us.

20:46.621 --> 20:49.082
We'll fight them, I guess.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.794
And if we lose?

20:52.877 --> 20:55.421
Jerry Garcia out there said
that he'd erase our brains,

20:55.505 --> 20:57.256
then send us back home.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.217
Or we could escape them somehow
and wait seven years

20:59.300 --> 21:00.802
for another folding,
on the off chance

21:00.885 --> 21:02.804
it actually takes us
to where we want to go.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.597
Well, then, I guess I call dibs

21:04.681 --> 21:06.641
on the freaky armored lady
trying to kill us.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.267
Not if I get to her first.

21:08.351 --> 21:10.395
Maybe if we stack you
on Erin's shoulders.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.064
- [both laugh]
- [Tessa roars]

21:14.107 --> 21:15.817
[Prioress] Ladies!

21:15.900 --> 21:17.860
We can do this
the easy way or the way

21:17.944 --> 21:20.405
where the dinosaur rips
the house apart.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.241
You decide.

21:39.257 --> 21:42.093
I already have
an expiration date.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.345
They only know about two of us.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.014
So maybe

21:46.097 --> 21:48.141
they'll go
without taking you guys...

21:48.224 --> 21:50.143
- Not a chance.
- We can't let you do that.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.562
Look, I've only got four more
years to live, so why don't I

21:52.645 --> 21:53.938
- just go outside alone?
- [Tiff] The only reason we're

21:54.022 --> 21:55.398
still standing here right now

21:55.481 --> 21:58.359
is because
we've stuck together this far.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.571
We're paper girls.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.698
So we stick together.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.366
Right?

22:05.408 --> 22:07.201
[Erin] Mm-hmm.

22:07.285 --> 22:10.246
We're not gonna change that now.

22:10.288 --> 22:13.666
[Tessa growls, roars]

22:33.227 --> 22:35.063
Guys, wait, wait.

22:36.314 --> 22:39.525
I'm sorry for what I said
earlier about your bat mitzvah.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.946
I'm sorry for all of it.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.700
I don't want to forget you guys.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.369
We don't want
to forget you either, Mac.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.997
Although...

22:53.081 --> 22:54.957
let's be honest.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.001
You couldn't
even if you tried, right?

22:58.211 --> 22:59.587
Yeah.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.339
You want to come, by the way?

23:01.422 --> 23:02.799
To what, your bat mitzvah?

23:04.092 --> 23:05.760
Yeah.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.887
You're all invited.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.598
If we survive this, that is.

23:10.681 --> 23:12.767
I'm there.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.310
I wouldn't miss it.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.940
Sure thing.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.152
If we make it,

23:23.236 --> 23:24.987
like you said.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.579
But I'm not wearing
a fucking dress.

23:33.663 --> 23:34.997
[chuckles softly]

23:40.086 --> 23:42.088
[thunder rumbling]

23:53.975 --> 23:55.685
Names.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.270
Erin.

23:57.353 --> 23:58.855
Erin Tieng.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.982
Tiffany Quilkin.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.319
And I'm Ben Dover
and this here is Buck Naked.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.322
Now let's get on with this,
you freaky bitch.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.868
â™ª â™ª

24:41.606 --> 24:43.608
[rumbling]

24:56.287 --> 24:58.247
I wonder if this is
what really happened

24:58.331 --> 25:00.833
to the people who think
they were abducted by aliens.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.711
If there's aliens
in addition to this,

25:03.794 --> 25:05.922
I really don't want to know.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.385
So if we see each other
on the street

25:11.469 --> 25:13.679
or the mall...

25:13.763 --> 25:16.307
you know, after this...

25:17.516 --> 25:19.393
...do you think
we'll recognize each other?

25:19.477 --> 25:21.062
I don't know.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.564
[Tiff] Maybe some
of it will stay.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.483
You know?

25:25.566 --> 25:27.485
Not the whole thing, but...

25:27.568 --> 25:29.070
maybe we might
remember stuff like...

25:29.153 --> 25:30.696
Erin's cool T-shirt.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.616
Or Mac's nasty smoker's breath.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.784
Hey! I quit already.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.410
You smoked a cigarette
on Tiff's roof

25:36.494 --> 25:37.954
last night.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.956
One, it was a clove,
so it doesn't count.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.042
And two...
that was only last night?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.127
How long have we been gone?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.922
I don't know.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.674
But I feel much, much older,

25:49.757 --> 25:51.676
I'll tell you that.

25:51.759 --> 25:54.553
- [whirring]
- [heavy thud]

26:00.184 --> 26:01.978
Tiffany Quilkin.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.021
Come with me.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.447
Oh, hell no.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.575
What are you gonna do with her?

26:16.659 --> 26:17.952
This doesn't concern
the rest of you.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.579
If it's about Tiffany, it does.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.873
Maybe you think I'm asking.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.875
Maybe if you were gonna
do something to us,

26:24.959 --> 26:26.460
you'd have done it already.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.007
Fine.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.092
Come with me.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.636
All of you.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.356
I was your age, maybe younger

26:47.440 --> 26:49.150
when I joined the Watch.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.570
The STF terrorists invaded
on the Fourth of July.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.573
To them, we were all guilty.
Guilty of creating

26:55.656 --> 26:58.284
the godforsaken future
they came from.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.619
A new kind of war.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.997
Made singularly possible

27:03.080 --> 27:05.416
by the discoveries of a team

27:05.499 --> 27:07.752
lead by Dr. Joan Braunstein.

27:07.835 --> 27:11.589
A team
of which you will be part.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.800
The Quilkin Institute.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.846
Why are you telling us this?

27:18.929 --> 27:21.390
I'm offering you
an opportunity.

27:24.060 --> 27:26.687
Do you still want
to save your sick friend?

27:46.624 --> 27:48.459
What is this place?

27:48.542 --> 27:50.544
Come on, ladies.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.679
â™ª â™ª

28:10.189 --> 28:12.274
[beeping and blipping]

28:17.947 --> 28:19.949
A folding.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.702
[Tiff] But controlled.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.955
Is it, like, permanent or what?

28:26.038 --> 28:27.957
Are those ships?

28:33.587 --> 28:35.214
They are.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.182
[Prioress] Like you,
I didn't choose to be

28:45.266 --> 28:47.017
part of this war,
it chose me.

28:47.101 --> 28:49.854
My generation, my timeline.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.398
For years, I have tried
to put out its fire,

28:52.481 --> 28:55.776
only to watch it
endlessly reemerge and mutate.

28:56.819 --> 29:00.364
This is our last, best chance
to make sure it never happens.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.950
Whether Grand Father
can admit it or not.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.119
Tell Dr. Quilkin
what you've seen.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.084
Sit.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.461
There.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.390
And if we do what you're saying,

29:26.474 --> 29:27.933
does that mean
my older self won't die?

29:28.017 --> 29:30.811
She was piloting that big robot

29:30.895 --> 29:32.771
and didn't survive.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.941
[Prioress] I don't know.

29:36.025 --> 29:39.820
But I believe the future can be
what we make it.

29:39.904 --> 29:42.198

Get in the ship.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.370
Yeah, let's get
the hell out of here!

29:48.454 --> 29:50.289
Stop!

29:50.372 --> 29:52.500
Prioress, what causes this?

29:52.583 --> 29:54.335
Are these travelers escaped?

29:54.418 --> 29:56.754
This one tried to deliver them.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.214
- He initiated launch.
- No!

29:58.297 --> 29:59.673
- But why do
the travelers still...
- She lies!

Whoa. These were real.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.318

- I'm so sorry.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.987
- If I can undo this,
I promise I will.
- Go.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.460

what do you think?
- We have to stop him.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.420

31:05.990 --> 31:08.492
She's gonna get left behind

Come on, guys! Come on!

31:10.327 --> 31:11.787
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

31:11.870 --> 31:14.373
Okay, just rest. Thank you.

What the fuck were you thinking?

33:56.535 --> 33:59.371
This is the only way
there can truly be peace.

33:59.455 --> 34:01.248
She's...

34:01.331 --> 34:03.417
she's Dr. Quilkin.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.462
- What?
- [Prioress] The Dr. Quilkin.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.299
She'll make a different choice.

35:39.847 --> 35:42.182
Flying cars, maybe?

35:43.308 --> 35:45.686
I don't see another capsule,
do you?

35:45.769 --> 35:48.480
[indistinct chatter echoing]
