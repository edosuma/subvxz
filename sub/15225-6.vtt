01:23.767 --> 01:24.868
Louie!

01:24.901 --> 01:26.100
Yeah.

01:26.133 --> 01:27.434
Cockroach
at 10:00.

01:29.601 --> 01:30.968
Oh, my God!

01:31.000 --> 01:34.400
That's the biggest
cockroach I've ever seen!

01:34.434 --> 01:36.067
That's a man-eater.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.234
I'm going up after it.

01:37.267 --> 01:38.400
Careful, Louie.

01:38.434 --> 01:39.734
Give me something,
give me something.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.734
Here.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.701
( <i>hollers</i> )

01:48.033 --> 01:49.400
Did you see that?

01:49.434 --> 01:51.033
I hit him dead center
with everything I had,

01:51.067 --> 01:52.234
and he just smiled at me.

01:52.267 --> 01:53.367
Here he comes!

01:53.400 --> 01:54.767
( <i>crashing</i> )

01:59.334 --> 02:02.567
Well...
he's gone now.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.834
Yeah... he's gone.

02:09.267 --> 02:11.000
But he'll be back.

02:17.968 --> 02:21.834
Jim, I-I'm expecting
an important call.

02:21.868 --> 02:24.801
Just a short call,
please, okay?

02:24.834 --> 02:26.567
Okeydoke.

02:26.601 --> 02:29.200
Thank-thanks a lot.

02:29.234 --> 02:32.801
Who am I calling?

02:32.834 --> 02:35.300
You mean, you weren't going
to use the phone?

02:35.334 --> 02:38.100
No, I-I was going
to the bathroom.

02:38.133 --> 02:40.000
Oh.

02:40.033 --> 02:42.300
But I'll make
that short, too.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.901
Tony, what's with Bobby
with the phone?

02:47.934 --> 02:48.934
Oh, today he finds out

02:48.968 --> 02:51.400
whether he got that movie part
he's been trying for.

02:51.434 --> 02:52.901
It's between me and another guy.

02:52.934 --> 02:54.234
I wish they'd call already.

02:54.267 --> 02:55.567
The suspense is killing me.

02:55.601 --> 02:57.400
Oh, Bob, Bob, come on.

02:57.434 --> 02:59.467
It's not the last job
you're going to lose.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.501
I mean, uh,
no, I mean, uh...

03:01.534 --> 03:03.767
Hey, what kind of
attitude is that?

03:03.801 --> 03:04.868
I mean, come on.

03:04.901 --> 03:06.267
Let's assume Bobby's
going to get the job

03:06.300 --> 03:07.701
and approach it with
a positive attitude,

03:07.734 --> 03:08.834
you know.
Sorry, Bob. Yeah.

03:08.868 --> 03:10.100
Let him hear the
negative things

03:10.133 --> 03:11.467
after he loses it.

03:11.501 --> 03:13.334
Oh, no, no, sorry.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.501
That's okay,
Elaine.

03:14.534 --> 03:15.701
I still think I have

03:15.734 --> 03:16.934
a damn good chance
of getting this.

03:16.968 --> 03:18.367
Well, good.
That's the way
to think, Bobby.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.534
LATKA:
Ifnosh cafe?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.033
Latka, Latka,
I'm waiting

03:21.067 --> 03:23.667
for an important call.

03:23.701 --> 03:25.400
Uh, this is important, too.

03:25.434 --> 03:28.601
I am ordering my lunch.

03:28.634 --> 03:31.300
You see, there
is a restaurant just open up,

03:31.334 --> 03:35.267
and they serve food
from my country.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.734
Yeah, but-but it's...
all right.

03:36.767 --> 03:37.901
Hello?

03:37.934 --> 03:39.133
Yes.

03:39.167 --> 03:41.667
Oh, yes, hello.

03:41.701 --> 03:42.667
Yes.

03:42.701 --> 03:44.167
Hello.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.734
Thank you, and you, too.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.868
I know.

03:49.901 --> 03:52.667
I would like to order
some food, please.

03:52.701 --> 03:54.367
Okay.

03:54.400 --> 04:00.167
First, I would like to order
a tossed <i>gravlitee.</i>

04:00.200 --> 04:02.334
I would like to... okay...

04:02.367 --> 04:05.634
and a fried <i>yufnish</i>
in the basket.

04:05.667 --> 04:11.267
 And a... a...
 <i>profnika</i>

04:11.300 --> 04:14.701
with everything.
Yes.

04:14.734 --> 04:16.466
Yes, and two large...

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
Latka, is there any way
you could do this faster?

04:18.534 --> 04:19.901
Oh, sure.

04:19.934 --> 04:22.601
Just give me the number seven.

04:22.634 --> 04:24.367
Thanks.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.267
( <i>phone rings</i> )

04:28.234 --> 04:29.200
Hi.

04:29.234 --> 04:31.567
Yeah, this is he.

04:33.901 --> 04:35.534
Yeah, I-I-I understand.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.868
Um...

04:36.901 --> 04:39.834
Yeah, thanks for calling.

04:39.868 --> 04:41.734
( <i>sighs</i> )

04:48.434 --> 04:49.400
Well, come on already.

04:49.434 --> 04:50.400
The suspense
is killing me.

04:50.434 --> 04:53.200
You get it or not?

04:53.234 --> 04:56.734
Banta, sometimes
I wish you were smarter

04:56.767 --> 04:59.300
just so you'd know
how dumb you are.

05:02.834 --> 05:05.934
The other guy beat me out.

05:05.968 --> 05:07.534
You know,
I've lost jobs before,

05:07.567 --> 05:09.000
but what kills me
about this one,

05:09.033 --> 05:10.334
is the guy I lost it to

05:10.367 --> 05:12.901
has almost no experience,
and he's not very good.

05:12.934 --> 05:15.534
The only reason he got this job

05:15.567 --> 05:16.534
is because of his looks.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.234
Oh, come on, Bobby.

05:18.267 --> 05:19.434
You're great-looking.

05:19.467 --> 05:22.334
No, you see,
they didn't cast him

05:22.367 --> 05:24.133
because
he's better looking than me.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.234
They cast him
because he has the right look.

05:26.267 --> 05:28.367
You see, casting,
it goes in cycles.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.501
Common looks are in now.

05:30.534 --> 05:32.834
It's a handicap
to be classically handsome.

05:32.868 --> 05:35.067
Don't I know it?

05:42.534 --> 05:45.634
You see... you see
the type they want now

05:45.667 --> 05:47.367
is long on street looks,

05:47.400 --> 05:48.834
short on brains.

05:48.868 --> 05:51.300
Somebody engaging,
with a boyish smile,

05:51.334 --> 05:52.701
animal magnetism

05:52.734 --> 05:55.000
and a dumb but
earnest face.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.901
Somebody like...

05:57.934 --> 06:01.167
Go ahead
and say it, Bobby.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.901
Somebody like Tony.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.334
All right!
Hear that?

06:04.367 --> 06:06.334
Hey, thanks a lot.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.734
Oh, oh, oh,
oh, this is it.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.100
I'm done.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.367
I'm through.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.601
I don't want to be
an actor anymore.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.767
My career is dead.

06:15.801 --> 06:18.467
Thank God--
it suffered long enough.

06:29.234 --> 06:31.534
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

06:31.567 --> 06:32.868
Bobby?

06:32.901 --> 06:34.367
Dropped by to see
how you're doing.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.534
How you doing?

06:35.567 --> 06:37.868
Okay, for a guy
whose career is over.

06:37.901 --> 06:39.868
Ah, that's good.

06:39.901 --> 06:42.200
I thought you'd still
be depressed or something.

06:42.234 --> 06:45.234
I brought beer and Fudgesicles.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.300
Look, uh, Tony,
I-I don't feel much

06:49.334 --> 06:51.300
like talking now,
you know?

06:51.334 --> 06:53.033
Well, uh, how do you
feel about answering?

06:53.067 --> 06:55.467
I could make up a question,
you could answer it.

06:55.501 --> 06:57.467
Okay,

06:57.501 --> 07:01.334
um, I was wondering,
Bobby,

07:01.367 --> 07:03.934
could you tell me
how to be an actor?

07:03.968 --> 07:05.868
Are you kidding?

07:05.901 --> 07:08.434
You said I was
what they were looking for.

07:08.467 --> 07:13.033
Tony, do you have any idea
what acting is like?

07:13.067 --> 07:14.367
Hey, Bobby,
when I was in grade school,

07:14.400 --> 07:16.400
I had a part in the play
 <i>Rip Van Winkle.</i>

07:16.434 --> 07:19.501
I know I shouldn't ask this.

07:19.534 --> 07:21.400
What part did you play?

07:21.434 --> 07:23.434
I was the guy that woke him up.

07:23.467 --> 07:25.334
( <i>groans</i> )

07:25.367 --> 07:26.834
Hey, Bobby, you think it's easy

07:26.868 --> 07:30.000
waking a guy up
after he's slept 40 years?

07:30.033 --> 07:33.567
Tony, you got Fudgesicle
all over your face.

07:33.601 --> 07:35.601
Listen, how do you get
an acting job, Bobby?

07:35.634 --> 07:37.200
Well, you're asking
the wrong guy.

07:37.234 --> 07:39.834
But, uh, you get an agent

07:39.868 --> 07:41.467
who introduces you
to casting directors

07:41.501 --> 07:43.367
who introduces you to producers
who hire you.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.701
Well, that's
sounds okay.

07:44.734 --> 07:45.868
Let's do it
like that.

07:45.901 --> 07:47.601
Tony, it's not that easy.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.868
Come on, you have no experience.

07:49.901 --> 07:52.701
Wake up.
Rip, wake up, Rip.

07:52.734 --> 07:54.200
Wake up, Rip.

07:54.234 --> 07:56.534
Almost no experience.

07:56.567 --> 07:58.200
You told me

07:58.234 --> 08:00.467
the guy who beat you out
yesterday for that movie part

08:00.501 --> 08:01.634
had almost no experience.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.667
And he wasn't even that good,
but he looked right.

08:03.701 --> 08:05.334
So, if I look right,
why can't I

08:05.367 --> 08:06.834
get parts, too, Bob?

08:06.868 --> 08:08.100
I don't...

08:09.801 --> 08:11.834
Hey, maybe you could.

08:11.868 --> 08:13.334
What the hell.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.801
I'll call my agent.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.167
The worst he can do
is laugh, right?

08:16.200 --> 08:19.234
Uh, Bobby, I don't think
I want your agent.

08:25.701 --> 08:27.467
And why not?

08:27.501 --> 08:31.501
I mean, he hasn't exactly
made you a star, you know.

08:31.534 --> 08:33.967
Tony, Tony, what is
it that you want?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.167
Bobby, I want you
to be my agent.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.833
You're my friend,
you'd look out for me.

08:37.868 --> 08:40.701
Tony, Tony,
that's crazy.

08:40.734 --> 08:42.000
Why?
You got extra time now,

08:42.033 --> 08:43.868
especially if you're
not gonna act anymore.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.767
( <i>sighs</i> )

08:46.801 --> 08:50.334
Tony, you don't know
what you're saying.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.534
Bobby, Bobby, listen.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.200
 I saw that movie
 <i>The Raging Bull,</i> right?

08:53.234 --> 08:54.334
Yeah.
And I read someplace

08:54.367 --> 08:56.033
where a lot of the guys
in that movie

08:56.067 --> 08:57.534
weren't real actors.

08:57.567 --> 08:59.300
Some of them were fighters
just like me.

08:59.334 --> 09:00.534
Bobby, Bobby,
listen, man.

09:00.567 --> 09:01.934
I'm serious about this.

09:01.968 --> 09:04.701
Bobby, I know
this sounds crazy,

09:04.734 --> 09:06.133
but all my life,

09:06.167 --> 09:08.100
I felt I was gonna be
something special.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.667
I thought I was
gonna be famous.

09:09.701 --> 09:11.801
I know that sounds crazy,
but that's the way I felt.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.501
I always thought
all this time

09:13.534 --> 09:15.334
I was gonna be
famous as a boxer,

09:15.367 --> 09:19.167
but when you said
"actor," it hit me.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.434
That's where I belong.

09:22.467 --> 09:25.567
You do have
the right face for it.

09:25.601 --> 09:27.000
That's what I think, too.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.467
A girl I once dated

09:28.501 --> 09:31.567
said I was an Italian
Sylvester Stallone.

09:31.601 --> 09:35.701
Yeah, I think the world
is waiting for one of those.

09:35.734 --> 09:38.367
And Bobby,
when I make it,

09:38.400 --> 09:40.400
you're in all
my movies.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.834
Oh, hey, what the hell?

09:45.868 --> 09:47.934
You know,
you may be a natural.

09:47.968 --> 09:50.033
You know,
sometimes that happens.

09:50.067 --> 09:53.067
You may have more talent
than either one of us realizes.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.067
That means
you'll do it?

09:55.100 --> 09:56.234
Yeah.
All right.

09:56.267 --> 09:58.267
( <i>laughs</i> )
I can't believe this.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.367
I am going to manage you.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.934
What do we do?
What do we do?

10:02.968 --> 10:04.901
Okay, now, hey,
we got a lot of work to do.

10:04.934 --> 10:06.167
Now first of all,

10:06.200 --> 10:07.534
I want you
to take these plays home.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.000
Here, here, here.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.801
And I want you to read them,
I want you to study them,

10:10.834 --> 10:12.033
I want you
to get familiar with them.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.534
And then tomorrow, we
start working together.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.367
All right, Bob.
Now, listen, we're
gonna do this right,

10:15.400 --> 10:16.701
right, Tony?
Okay.

10:16.734 --> 10:18.567
Hey, Bobby, this is gonna be
a great partnership.

10:18.601 --> 10:19.901
You bet it is.

10:19.934 --> 10:21.567
Hey, Bobby,
this is one of my favorites--

10:21.601 --> 10:22.901
 <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

10:22.934 --> 10:25.267
I seen the Disney version.

10:55.267 --> 10:56.601
You're still looking

10:56.634 --> 10:58.734
for that stupid bug,
aren't you?

10:58.767 --> 11:00.000
Stupid bug?

11:00.033 --> 11:01.601
Nardo, I'll have you know

11:01.634 --> 11:04.934
that cockroaches were around
before dinosaurs.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.534
You think they stayed around
that long by being dumb?

11:07.567 --> 11:09.200
If he could see
over a dashboard,

11:09.234 --> 11:11.834
I'd have this one driving a cab.

11:11.868 --> 11:14.968
I've never seen you
so nervous before.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.701
I'm not nervous.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.434
I'm just a little curious.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.801
And I'm trying to do my part
for the hygiene...

11:20.834 --> 11:21.567
What's that?!

11:21.601 --> 11:23.400
( <i>hollers</i> )

11:24.467 --> 11:26.000
I couldn't resist.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.801
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.567
Nardo, when I catch this one,

11:29.601 --> 11:32.434
I'm gonna fix you up with it.

11:33.501 --> 11:35.133
Hey, guys,

11:35.167 --> 11:37.534
want to see some pictures
I had taken for auditions?

11:37.567 --> 11:38.534
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.100
Three poses for 50 cents.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.100
And what's this
one for?

11:43.133 --> 11:46.200
The one where
you're like this?

11:46.234 --> 11:49.901
That's to show
I can do comedy.

11:49.934 --> 11:52.200
Bobby, look at these
pictures I had taken.

11:52.234 --> 11:56.534
I figure we can show 'em
to casting people.

11:56.567 --> 11:58.400
Show business is tough.

11:58.434 --> 11:59.901
Look, Tony,
don't worry

11:59.934 --> 12:02.167
about that kind
of stuff, huh.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.033
I've taken care of it.

12:04.067 --> 12:05.701
I've been all over town
the last couple of days.

12:05.734 --> 12:07.601
Every casting director
in this city

12:07.634 --> 12:09.200
has your picture
on his desk.

12:09.234 --> 12:11.934
Isn't he great?

12:11.968 --> 12:14.300
And he's doing it
for only ten percent

12:14.334 --> 12:15.467
of my earnings.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.801
Look, uh, I want you
to read a scene for me.

12:17.834 --> 12:20.467
 It's a scene from <i>Long</i>
 <i>Day's Journey Into Night.</i>

12:20.501 --> 12:23.167
Now you're the youngest son,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.167
and you're trying to
explain to your father

12:25.200 --> 12:26.701
that you've never felt
at home anywhere.

12:26.734 --> 12:28.934
Okay.
Go ahead, stand up.

12:28.968 --> 12:31.767
( <i>clears throat</i> )

12:33.934 --> 12:35.901
( <i>stiffly</i> ):
It was a great mistake,

12:35.934 --> 12:38.067
my being born a man.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.400
I would have been
much more successful

12:40.434 --> 12:43.067
as a seagull or a fish.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.000
Okay, hold it, Tony.

12:45.033 --> 12:46.467
I want to give you
some direction.

12:46.501 --> 12:47.667
I want you to listen to me.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.067
I want you to start over again,

12:49.100 --> 12:50.901
and I want you to think
about what you're saying.

12:50.934 --> 12:53.667
I want you to feel the words,
feel the emotion.

12:53.701 --> 12:54.901
Trust everything.

12:54.934 --> 12:55.901
Leave that pain
open, okay?

12:55.934 --> 12:57.067
Now-now go with it.
Now just...

12:57.100 --> 12:58.067
Take a moment.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.634
Take a moment,
and breathe.

13:14.067 --> 13:16.667
( <i>stiffly</i> ):
It was a great mistake

13:16.701 --> 13:18.267
my being born a man.

13:18.300 --> 13:21.067
I would have been
much more successful

13:21.100 --> 13:24.267
as a seagull or a fish.

13:28.968 --> 13:30.968
LATKA:
Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.767
I want to ask
you something.

13:34.801 --> 13:37.267
I could not help overhearing.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.567
Uh, I-I would like you...

13:41.601 --> 13:46.567
could you to be my agent, too?

13:48.501 --> 13:52.234
One time this Italian,
uh, movie company

13:52.267 --> 13:53.901
come to my village

13:53.934 --> 13:57.234
to film a movie
called <i>Here Come the Huns.</i>

13:57.267 --> 14:00.667
Uh, do you want to
see my performance?

14:00.701 --> 14:02.334
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Tony...

14:02.367 --> 14:05.834
Now in this scene,

14:05.868 --> 14:09.501
the-the terrible people,

14:09.534 --> 14:11.033
terrible men, the Huns,

14:11.067 --> 14:15.200
have gone burned
everything to the ground.

14:15.234 --> 14:18.534
And all the women and children,

14:18.567 --> 14:22.868
their bodies are lying around.

14:22.901 --> 14:25.601
The crops are ruined.

14:25.634 --> 14:33.567
Everything
I have ever known is...

14:36.234 --> 14:38.000
...destroyed.

14:43.634 --> 14:50.734
And so I am standing there,
looking at, at all of this...

14:52.901 --> 14:54.601
and it goes a little
something like this.

15:02.267 --> 15:03.501
Wait.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.834
( <i>clucking tongue</i> )

15:30.067 --> 15:31.634
He's good.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.267
( <i>phone rings</i> )

15:33.300 --> 15:36.033
BOBBY:
I'll get it.

15:36.067 --> 15:38.334
Hello,
Robert Wheeler Management.

15:38.367 --> 15:39.667
Yes, this is he.

15:39.701 --> 15:40.868
Uh, my secretary stepped...

15:40.901 --> 15:42.767
Yeah, I represent
Tony Banta.

15:42.801 --> 15:45.267
Just let me check
those dates.

15:48.234 --> 15:51.033
Well, I see that we're
presently negotiating

15:51.067 --> 15:53.200
for a part in the new
Jane Fonda film,

15:53.234 --> 15:55.033
which could tie him up
during that period.

15:55.067 --> 15:57.033
Yeah, it is.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.200
It's pretty well set,

15:58.234 --> 15:59.534
but we're not locked in yet.

15:59.567 --> 16:03.133
I tell you what, you
give him an audition time

16:03.167 --> 16:06.567
and I can always work out
something with Jane.

16:06.601 --> 16:07.667
Yeah, yeah, okay.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.801
What was that?
What was that?

16:09.834 --> 16:12.367
11... 2:30, okay.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.634
All right, he will be there.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.133
All right, yeah,
and thanks for calling.

16:16.167 --> 16:17.734
( <i>shrieking with glee</i> )

16:17.767 --> 16:18.767
I heard.

16:18.801 --> 16:19.934
This is so exciting.

16:19.968 --> 16:22.100
I can't believe it,
your first audition.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.100
Audition?

16:23.133 --> 16:24.634
Hey, I want to hear
about the Fonda film.

16:32.968 --> 16:35.334
Arthur Kramer
and Jerry Lowe,

16:35.367 --> 16:37.000
this is Tony Banta

16:37.033 --> 16:38.667
and Mr. Banta's
manager, Mr. Wheeler,

16:38.701 --> 16:40.167
who'll be reading
with him.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.267
How do you do?
Sit down.
Nice to see you.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.801
So, uh, Tony,

16:45.834 --> 16:48.234
you want to tell us something
about yourself before we start?

16:48.267 --> 16:50.667
No, but thanks for asking.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.267
Okay.

16:57.901 --> 17:01.000
Well, uh, why don't we just
start the reading then?

17:01.033 --> 17:04.767
Tony, the role you're playing
is self-explanatory.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.099
You're a young New Yorker
of Italian descent--

17:07.133 --> 17:09.166
eager, innocent
and a little slow.

17:11.434 --> 17:13.300
I'll give it a shot.

17:13.334 --> 17:15.400
You two can start
when you're ready.

17:17.434 --> 17:20.099
Okay, Tony,
I'm gonna start, all right?
Okay.

17:20.133 --> 17:22.767
Okay, now, I play the part
of the father; remember that.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
Okay.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.367
All right, uh,
here, you stand over here

17:25.400 --> 17:27.099
so they can see
your face better.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.099
All right, you ready?

17:28.133 --> 17:31.534
Yeah, I'm ready.
I'm ready.

17:31.567 --> 17:32.834
"I understand
if you hate me.

17:32.868 --> 17:35.267
"I can't blame you
for that,

17:35.300 --> 17:39.000
even if it hurts me
more than I've ever
been hurt."

17:39.033 --> 17:40.300
( <i>stiffly</i> ):
"Yeah, okay."

17:40.334 --> 17:42.701
But at least
try to understand.

17:42.734 --> 17:45.834
You don't know what
it was like for me
all those years--

17:45.868 --> 17:48.567
living a lie, pretending I was
somebody that I wasn't,

17:48.601 --> 17:50.968
trying to drown that pain
with booze and drugs.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.734
Hey, listen.

17:53.767 --> 17:57.000
No, let me go on.

17:57.033 --> 18:00.000
This isn't easy for me,
but you have to know.

18:00.033 --> 18:02.801
I did my best.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.934
Those years,
they were hell for me.

18:04.968 --> 18:06.567
Sometimes I thought
I would go crazy.

18:06.601 --> 18:08.133
Finally, there was
nothing I could do

18:08.167 --> 18:09.167
but just run
away from it,

18:09.200 --> 18:12.033
and I'm ashamed
of that now.

18:12.067 --> 18:13.901
But it was either that

18:13.934 --> 18:18.267
or taking my life
with my own hands.

18:18.300 --> 18:21.667
Son... I'm so glad
we can talk like this

18:21.701 --> 18:23.734
after all
these years.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.534
"Me, too."

18:30.334 --> 18:32.567
Thank you. Thank you.
I think we've heard enough.

18:32.601 --> 18:35.267
Oh, yeah. Uh,
come on, Tony.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.634
Yeah.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.133
Can you start
tomorrow?

18:39.200 --> 18:40.167
Him?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.367
You bet!

18:42.734 --> 18:45.100
Are you saying you want...
him for the role?

18:45.133 --> 18:46.667
Yeah, that's what
we're saying.

18:46.701 --> 18:48.734
We want him
to start tomorrow

18:48.767 --> 18:50.634
in Long Island for
some location shooting.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.868
You, you're going
to hire him

18:52.901 --> 18:54.501
after that reading?

18:57.100 --> 18:59.167
Well, it's a small part.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.634
You know,
we'll get a dialogue coach

19:00.667 --> 19:02.534
to help him out
a little bit with the lines.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.133
He'll be fine.

19:04.167 --> 19:06.234
Oh, uh, because
he looks right.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.100
Yeah.

19:09.834 --> 19:12.567
Well, I think
that's just dandy.

19:12.601 --> 19:14.968
I mean, that's
just wonderful.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.634
You're going to cast him
for his face

19:17.667 --> 19:20.701
because of the way
he looks.

19:20.734 --> 19:22.467
After the reading
that he just gave

19:22.501 --> 19:23.667
you still want him.

19:23.701 --> 19:26.767
I think that's
just terrific.

19:26.801 --> 19:30.033
You hire him, please,
please hire him.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.467
I mean, go ahead,

19:31.501 --> 19:33.601
go ahead
and hire him.

19:33.634 --> 19:35.734
Hey, why don't you
hire him and give him
the lead, you know.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.601
Hey, hurry up. Sign him to
a long-term contract.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.868
Quick, before somebody
comes up and grabs him away.

19:39.901 --> 19:42.801
Come on! You know, you got a
whole roomful of them out there.

19:42.834 --> 19:43.834
Hire them all.

19:43.868 --> 19:46.934
Just think,
a whole picture of his face.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.033
Come on!

19:48.067 --> 19:50.234
Hey, any of you guys
want a job?

19:50.267 --> 19:52.534
Does he work
for his ten percent or what?

20:01.334 --> 20:04.067
Bobby, you here?

20:04.100 --> 20:07.267
Hey, Tony, look, I'm really
sorry what happened yesterday.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.100
Something just snapped
and I went crazy.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.400
That's okay.

20:12.601 --> 20:16.734
So, uh, how did
your first day
go as an actor?

20:16.767 --> 20:18.400
Well, it had its ups and downs.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.934
I went to Long Island.

20:20.968 --> 20:22.901
Had some good coffee.

20:22.934 --> 20:24.801
People treated me real nice.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.868
I watched George C. Scott
eat a jelly doughnut.

20:26.901 --> 20:28.100
Then they fired me.

20:30.033 --> 20:31.467
They fired you?

20:31.501 --> 20:34.033
Yeah, the director
didn't want me.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.534
He said I wasn't right
for the role-- or any role.

20:36.567 --> 20:40.200
He used words like
"wrong interpretation"

20:40.234 --> 20:45.133
and "artistic differences,"
"over my dead body..."

20:45.167 --> 20:47.868
Tony, listen, I'm really sorry.

20:47.901 --> 20:49.767
It's okay.

20:49.801 --> 20:52.567
No, I know it meant
a lot to you.

20:52.601 --> 20:55.601
And if anybody knows how
you're feeling right now...

20:55.634 --> 20:58.634
Hey, Bobby, I'm sorry
I let you down.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.501
Tony, I got a confession
to make.

21:01.534 --> 21:03.501
As bad as you feel now

21:03.534 --> 21:05.501
and as bad as I feel for you,

21:05.534 --> 21:07.367
I'm glad you
got fired.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.300
Something better
came through.

21:10.334 --> 21:11.834
Well, no.

21:11.868 --> 21:13.367
The Jane Fonda movie.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.601
The director...
he was right.

21:16.634 --> 21:18.667
How do you know?
You weren't even there, Bobby.

21:18.701 --> 21:20.234
I didn't have to be
there, he was right.

21:20.267 --> 21:22.200
And thank God
for that director.

21:22.234 --> 21:24.267
Thank God, somebody
finally stood up

21:24.300 --> 21:26.133
and fought
for quality.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.133
Hey, Bobby, I know
you're the manager

21:28.167 --> 21:29.734
and I don't want
to tell you your job,

21:29.767 --> 21:32.033
but isn't it about now
you start building confidence?

21:32.067 --> 21:33.701
Tony, don't you understand?

21:33.734 --> 21:36.701
There are people who sacrifice
food and clothing

21:36.734 --> 21:38.100
for acting lessons...

21:38.133 --> 21:40.100
who freeze in the winter

21:40.133 --> 21:42.667
and are one step from hell
in the summer...

21:42.701 --> 21:45.000
living in poverty just
so they can be in New York

21:45.033 --> 21:46.601
and step out onto a dark stage

21:46.634 --> 21:47.801
and give the best
damn performance

21:47.834 --> 21:50.100
of their lives, just to hear,
"thank you very much,

21:50.133 --> 21:54.534
next please" again
and again and again.

21:54.567 --> 21:55.934
Those people are actors, Tony.

21:55.968 --> 22:00.267
And they do what they do,
because they love acting.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.133
See, when that director
fired you today,

22:02.167 --> 22:05.000
it was like he was saying
to all those people "I care!"

22:05.033 --> 22:07.667
Do you know
what that means, Tony?

22:07.701 --> 22:09.434
It means that there
are powerful people out there

22:09.467 --> 22:10.934
who still care about
professionalism.

22:10.968 --> 22:12.801
It means that acting

22:12.834 --> 22:16.200
and everything
the theater represents...

22:16.234 --> 22:18.501
is still alive.

22:18.534 --> 22:21.534
Just 'cause
I got canned.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.734
Wow.

22:27.834 --> 22:30.634
Tony, I'm gonna tell
every actor I know

22:30.667 --> 22:32.167
what happened today.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.067
You're going to be
an inspiration

22:34.100 --> 22:37.033
for them to go on.

22:37.067 --> 22:38.033
How does that
make you feel?

22:38.067 --> 22:40.033
It makes me feel great.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.534
But I got to tell you something,
I hope they don't expect me

22:42.567 --> 22:45.133
to bail them out
every time.

22:51.968 --> 22:56.033
( <i>loudly</i> ):
Well, good night, everybody.

22:56.067 --> 22:58.801
Good night.
Everybody out of the garage.

23:00.467 --> 23:01.434
All right.

23:01.467 --> 23:05.334
( <i>stomping</i> )

23:17.067 --> 23:18.667
( <i>mutters quietly</i> )

23:31.601 --> 23:34.033
( <i>whispering</i> ):
Ignore me, ignore me.

23:34.067 --> 23:36.534
Yeah, I would,
but what the hell are you doing?

23:39.033 --> 23:40.133
Roach.

23:41.334 --> 23:44.000
I put hamburger meat
on the end of this.

23:44.033 --> 23:46.934
When he nibbles--
yank his head off.

23:49.634 --> 23:51.634
Louie, Louie,
aren't you getting

23:51.667 --> 23:53.367
a little obsessed
with this roach?

23:53.400 --> 23:55.567
I mean, how big
can the roach
possibly be?

23:55.601 --> 23:58.567
Rieger, this is not
just a roach.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.868
It's a <i>roach.</i>

24:02.901 --> 24:04.434
He's got hairy legs.

24:04.467 --> 24:08.334
He's got bloodshot
eyes, Rieger.

24:10.434 --> 24:12.734
What, what, what?

24:12.767 --> 24:15.033
What are you looking
at me like that for?

24:15.067 --> 24:16.567
You got a bite.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.834
( <i>both moan fearfully</i> )

24:35.501 --> 24:39.200
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

25:02.534 --> 25:04.000
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.

25:04.033 --> 25:05.467
( <i>grunts</i> )

25:06.305 --> 25:12.478
