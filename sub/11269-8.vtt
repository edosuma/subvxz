Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:04.220 --> 00:06.454
Hey, Cliffy.
Oh, hey, Sam.

00:06.455 --> 00:08.122
What are you doing
standing out in the rain?

00:08.124 --> 00:09.257
Uh, it's good for the skin.

00:09.258 --> 00:11.410
You know, negative ions.
Keeps it soft.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.578
What'd you say
to Carla, Cliffy.

00:13.612 --> 00:15.313
Called her a dwarf.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.681
Oh.

00:16.682 --> 00:17.982
Could you, uh, untie me, Sam?

00:17.983 --> 00:19.451
Yeah, sure.

00:19.452 --> 00:21.603
Thanks. Oh, whoa, whoa, wait
a second, wait a second.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.171
How much more time
you got out here?

00:23.172 --> 00:24.856
Uh, five minutes.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.508
I'm sorry, buddy,
I can't do it.

00:26.509 --> 00:28.510
She'd have me standing
right out here next to you.

00:28.511 --> 00:29.578
I understand, Sam,
I understand.

00:29.579 --> 00:30.579
No hard feelings.

01:40.917 --> 01:46.421
Attention, everybody,
I have an announcement to make.

01:46.422 --> 01:48.990
Thanksgiving is in a few days,
and I know that some of you

01:48.991 --> 01:50.993
will not be able to spend it
with your families.

01:50.994 --> 01:53.979
So, anybody who doesn't have
any place to go on Thanksgiving

01:53.980 --> 01:55.414
is welcome to come
to my apartment.

01:55.415 --> 01:58.199
I thought that would
be a nice gesture.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.835
How'd you like to see
another nice gesture?

02:00.837 --> 02:04.722
Carla Tortelli
graciously accepts.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.925
How about you, Sam?

02:07.926 --> 02:08.959
Yeah. I think it'd be fun

02:08.960 --> 02:10.461
to go to Thanksgiving dinner
at your place.

02:10.461 --> 02:11.546
Oh, great.

02:11.547 --> 02:12.730
You know, I really think I can

02:12.731 --> 02:14.065
put together a great
Thanksgiving dinner.

02:14.066 --> 02:16.084
This'll be the second
one that I've cooked.

02:16.085 --> 02:17.553
And believe me, the first one

02:17.554 --> 02:20.522
was not the disaster that
my family said it was.

02:20.556 --> 02:24.792
Those kids had a pretty
good time in that ambulance.

02:24.793 --> 02:27.612
It was kind of
exciting for them.

02:27.613 --> 02:30.081
I mean, at least it wasn't
the same old same old.

02:31.102 --> 02:33.151
Oh, wait a second.

02:33.152 --> 02:34.152
Did you say Thanksgiving?

02:34.153 --> 02:35.486
Aw, shoot.

02:35.487 --> 02:37.221
See, I usually spend
Thanksgiving

02:37.222 --> 02:38.506
with my old Army buddies.

02:38.574 --> 02:40.324
Sam, you weren't in the Army.

02:40.409 --> 02:43.478
No, no, but, uh,
my buddies were.

02:43.479 --> 02:47.515
You know, I-I'd invite
you all over to my place,

02:47.516 --> 02:50.351
but Ma's down in Florida
working on her tan.

02:50.352 --> 02:52.069
Yeah, she's got this
standing rule that, uh,

02:52.070 --> 02:53.838
when she's not around,
I'm not allowed to bring

02:53.839 --> 02:55.707
any more than two friends
over at a time.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.059
Please, she's never gonna know.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.912
Yes, she will, Norm.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.880
Tell you what,
why-why don't we have

03:02.881 --> 03:04.349
Thanksgiving dinner
here at Cheers?

03:04.350 --> 03:05.650
Pot luck, huh?

03:05.651 --> 03:07.184
Why here? Because you don't
think I can handle

03:07.185 --> 03:09.804
the responsibility of making
a big dinner for everybody?

03:09.805 --> 03:12.207
Well, I was gonna beat
around the bush a little bit,

03:12.208 --> 03:13.598
but, yeah, that's the gist.

03:13.599 --> 03:17.295
Well, if you're gonna have it,
can we have a turkey?

03:17.296 --> 03:19.166
I was just gonna make
grilled cheese.

03:19.167 --> 03:20.632
All right, we'll have a turkey.

03:20.633 --> 03:21.766
Good idea.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.401
Okay, who's in
on the dinner here, huh?

03:23.402 --> 03:24.536
Count me in.
All right.

03:24.570 --> 03:25.703
Fras, what about you?

03:25.704 --> 03:27.372
Oh, you probably have
other plans, don't you?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.958
Oh, yes, big plans.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.576
Frederick and I will
be spending the day

03:31.577 --> 03:34.813
with the new friends we've
made since Lilith's departure:

03:34.847 --> 03:38.449
Mrs. Paul,
Dinty Moore,

03:38.483 --> 03:40.118
Uncle Ben.

03:40.152 --> 03:44.022
Oh, and maybe the
Stouffers will stop by.

03:44.056 --> 03:45.623
Why don't you join us, huh?

03:45.657 --> 03:47.025
Oh, thanks, Sam.

03:47.059 --> 03:49.076
WOODY:
Oh, Mr. Gaines.

03:49.077 --> 03:50.277
What a nice surprise.

03:50.278 --> 03:52.313
You remember Mr. Peterson,
Mr. Clavin?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.915
Nick. Clyde.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.069
Actually, it's, uh,
it's Norm, Cliff.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.271
You're lucky I got that close.

04:00.272 --> 04:04.643
Now, Woody, the reason
I came by here is that

04:04.644 --> 04:05.843
now that you're my son-in-law,

04:05.844 --> 04:07.579
I need your signature
on some papers here.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.830
So what are they?

04:08.864 --> 04:10.965
Oh, it's, uh, nothing important.

04:10.966 --> 04:13.334
Just, uh, some silly forms
giving me power of attorney

04:13.335 --> 04:14.569
over all of your affairs.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.387
You see, the Gaines estate

04:17.456 --> 04:18.822
is wide and varied.

04:18.824 --> 04:20.357
And now that you're
married to Kelly,

04:20.358 --> 04:22.259
you're part of that estate.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.679
I'm not sure I
understand all this.

04:24.714 --> 04:27.749
Oh, let me put it
in Hanover-ese, Woody.

04:27.783 --> 04:30.852
You know how a turkey, when,
uh, it feeds at the trough,

04:30.886 --> 04:32.153
will eat until it dies?

04:32.155 --> 04:33.938
Well,

04:33.939 --> 04:35.289
these forms give me the right...

04:35.290 --> 04:37.191
now that you're feeding
at the Gaines trough...

04:37.192 --> 04:39.782
to pull your head away
if I think you're gonna choke.

04:41.147 --> 04:44.815
Well, turkeys don't
choke, Mr. Gaines,

04:44.850 --> 04:46.017
they explode.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.285
Well, the one clue you get

04:48.320 --> 04:51.221
is you-you hear this hissing
sound just before they blow.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.341
Now, you hear a turkey hissing,

04:53.375 --> 04:54.425
head for the hills.

04:55.961 --> 04:59.296
Turkey shrapnel can kill you.

04:59.332 --> 05:02.350
For God's sake,
Woody, just sign

05:02.384 --> 05:05.019
or make your mark
or whatever it is you do.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.058
Thank you, Woody.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.160
Oh, wait, uh,
Mr. Gaines.

05:13.195 --> 05:15.196
I just got paid today and, uh,

05:15.197 --> 05:17.048
if I'm now part
of the Gaines estate,

05:17.049 --> 05:20.935
I guess I should do my part and
throw my pay-check into the pot.

05:23.989 --> 05:26.223
(chuckling)

05:27.943 --> 05:29.310
Good, Woody.

05:29.344 --> 05:31.279
Always leave them laughing.

05:31.887 --> 05:35.850
Why do you let him talk
to you like that, huh?

05:35.851 --> 05:36.901
NORM:
Yeah,

05:36.902 --> 05:38.469
you got to stand
up to him, Wood.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.789
I'd never let my father-in-law
take advantage of me that way.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.523
CLIFF:
I, uh, thought

05:42.541 --> 05:44.608
your father-in-law
was dead, Norm.

05:44.627 --> 05:47.729
You know, he might be.

05:49.765 --> 05:53.000
Haven't seen him in ages.

05:53.001 --> 05:55.103
Come to think of it,
I do remember Vera left a note

05:55.104 --> 05:57.105
on the refrigerator one night.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.140
Something about a funeral.

05:59.191 --> 06:02.927
Ah, shoot, this is
gonna drive me crazy.

06:02.978 --> 06:06.865
You know, Sam, I always
wanted to get along

06:06.899 --> 06:09.367
with Mr. Gaines like
I do with my dad.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.002
You and your daddy
got along well, huh?

06:11.003 --> 06:13.304
Oh, yeah. Oh.

06:13.339 --> 06:16.007
We'd go fish and bowl,

06:16.041 --> 06:18.042
hang around,

06:18.077 --> 06:20.245
pass notes to each
other in class.

06:24.416 --> 06:28.486
Woody, you know,
it's none of my business,

06:28.487 --> 06:30.888
but I think you ought to stand
up to Mr. Gaines right now,

06:30.889 --> 06:33.425
or he's gonna be walking all
over you the rest of your life.

06:33.426 --> 06:36.076
Well, I'd like to
stand up to him, Sam,

06:36.111 --> 06:38.045
but he scares me.

06:38.079 --> 06:39.180
Well, I know.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.364
He's a pretty intimidating guy.

06:40.365 --> 06:42.366
But you know the way
around that is you figure out

06:42.367 --> 06:45.202
what you're gonna say, get it
in your head all straight,

06:45.203 --> 06:47.071
then you go over there
and you tell him.

06:47.072 --> 06:49.824
Well, what would you say, Sam?

06:49.909 --> 06:51.542
Me?

06:51.576 --> 06:52.910
Oh. Well, I don't know.

06:52.945 --> 06:56.347
Something like, uh, you know,
"I'm disappointed in you.

06:56.381 --> 06:58.682
"You should be ashamed
of yourself, you know.

06:58.683 --> 07:00.417
"Things are gonna be
different from now on.

07:00.418 --> 07:02.888
You're gonna give me
the respect that I deserve."

07:04.457 --> 07:06.791
Yeah, I always thought
I did respect you, Sam.

07:06.826 --> 07:07.876
Maybe I was wrong.

07:07.877 --> 07:09.644
Tell you what,
why-why don't we, uh,

07:09.645 --> 07:12.496
why don't we drive over there
and-and you can rehearse

07:12.497 --> 07:14.365
what you're gonna say
on the way, all right?

07:14.366 --> 07:15.533
Well, I suppose if I don't,

07:15.534 --> 07:16.901
I'll have to listen
to another lecture

07:16.902 --> 07:19.404
about how I don't respect you.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.639
Okay, okay, I'm 95% sure

07:21.673 --> 07:24.175
Vera's father is alive.

07:24.176 --> 07:25.209
No, no, dead.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.160
No, make that dead.

07:26.161 --> 07:27.912
He's dead.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.748
Or could he be...

07:30.782 --> 07:32.450
Well...

07:32.484 --> 07:35.253
suppose I'll just call
Vera and ask her, I guess.

07:35.647 --> 07:38.672
I don't know how you ask someone

07:38.673 --> 07:40.423
(chuckles):
A question like that.

07:41.410 --> 07:44.480
Although Vera is always saying
we should talk more, you know.

07:45.464 --> 07:46.931
Uh, yes, hi, honey, hi.

07:46.966 --> 07:51.336
Uh, listen, um, do I, uh,
do I have a dark suit?

07:51.370 --> 07:53.438
I do? Um, good.

07:53.472 --> 07:56.007
D-Do you remember,
uh, why I bought it?

07:58.077 --> 07:59.743
A funeral, of course.

07:59.745 --> 08:02.680
Was, uh, was your father there?

08:04.483 --> 08:06.717
Was he wearing makeup
by any chance?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.188
Vera? Vera?

08:11.190 --> 08:14.625
Shoot, this is gonna
bug me all day.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.179
(moans):
Oh, Walter.

08:19.214 --> 08:20.581
Oh.
Oh!

08:20.616 --> 08:22.216
(moaning):
Oh! Oh.

08:22.217 --> 08:23.851
Katherine, Katherine,
we can't go on like this.

08:23.852 --> 08:24.819
Walter...

08:24.820 --> 08:26.080
You're my brother's wife.

08:26.081 --> 08:28.639
I mean, if anyone
ever found out,

08:28.640 --> 08:30.241
it would ruin both our families.

08:30.242 --> 08:31.642
You're right,
Walter, it's wrong.

08:31.643 --> 08:32.710
Terribly wrong.

08:32.744 --> 08:34.313
But I don't care.
That's my girl.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.333
Mr. Gaines is in the library,
right through there.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.003
Aren't you gonna announce us?

08:42.054 --> 08:44.272
Very well, sir.

08:44.306 --> 08:47.408
Mr. Gaines, there are
two gentlemen here to see you.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.194
That make you feel
like a big man?

08:52.197 --> 08:54.098
Ah, don't worry about that.

08:54.132 --> 08:57.001
Okay, just like we rehearsed
it in the car, big fellow.

08:57.002 --> 08:58.119
All right,
I'm disappointed in him,

08:58.120 --> 08:59.687
he should be ashamed of himself,

08:59.688 --> 09:01.789
and he should start
treating me with respect.

09:01.790 --> 09:02.790
Attaboy.

09:02.791 --> 09:04.124
Yeah.

09:04.159 --> 09:05.960
Mr. Gaines?

09:06.078 --> 09:07.211
(moaning):
Oh, God.

09:07.245 --> 09:08.379
Woody!

09:08.414 --> 09:09.980
What are you doing here?

09:09.981 --> 09:11.215
Oh, I-I can see you're busy.

09:11.216 --> 09:12.633
I'll wait outside.

09:12.801 --> 09:14.035
My God, Walter.

09:14.036 --> 09:15.102
Who was that?

09:15.103 --> 09:16.137
That was my idiot
son-in-law.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.139
Woody, just a minute!

09:17.140 --> 09:19.107
Well, did he see us?

09:19.141 --> 09:20.407
Of course he saw us.

09:20.408 --> 09:21.992
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

09:21.993 --> 09:25.096
I've got to catch him before he
blabs it all over the mansion.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.081
What do you mean
he's exercising?

09:29.318 --> 09:31.152
That's what it looked like.

09:31.186 --> 09:33.487
I-I think he was doing push-ups.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.122
Oh, come on.

09:35.123 --> 09:36.824
You're just trying
to back out of this.

09:36.825 --> 09:38.676
No, I'm not, Sam.
I'm gonna tell him.

09:38.694 --> 09:40.444
Well, then...
Excuse me.

09:40.479 --> 09:43.481
You're the gentlemen I led
from the foyer to the library,

09:43.515 --> 09:44.565
am I correct?

09:44.583 --> 09:46.501
(chuckles):
Yeah, right.

09:46.535 --> 09:50.238
Would you be a dear
and help me find my way back?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.856
Uh, sure.

09:52.857 --> 09:54.392
Well, actually, you know,
it's not that hard.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.927
All you got to do is go down
the, uh, that staircase

09:56.928 --> 09:59.547
with those naked angels
that are carved in the banister.

09:59.548 --> 10:02.082
Then-then you, uh, go through
that long hallway

10:02.117 --> 10:03.651
with the three naked ladies

10:03.685 --> 10:06.320
kind of frolicking
in the field there.

10:06.321 --> 10:08.990
And then you go take a left,
and you get in that big room

10:08.991 --> 10:11.959
that has that, uh,
bronze statue of the b...

10:11.977 --> 10:14.912
I'll tell you what, why don't
I take you there myself?

10:14.946 --> 10:16.446
I'll be right back.

10:16.447 --> 10:20.768
Now, Woody, I know you must
be terribly confused,

10:20.769 --> 10:21.869
but there's
a simple explanation.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.137
No, no, no,
Mr. Gaines.

10:23.138 --> 10:24.789
You're gonna sit down,
and I'm gonna talk,

10:24.790 --> 10:26.224
and you're
gonna listen. All right.

10:26.225 --> 10:29.293
Now... I'm very
disappointed in you.

10:29.294 --> 10:30.962
Ah.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.081
From now on, things are
gonna be different.

10:33.082 --> 10:35.849
You're gonna start
treating me with respect.

10:35.850 --> 10:36.834
Whatever you want, Woody.

10:36.835 --> 10:37.935
What will it take for you

10:37.936 --> 10:39.003
to forget everything
that's happened?

10:39.004 --> 10:40.104
You name it.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.305
Seriously?
Oh, yes.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.008
Whatever you want.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.553
Wow, that speech really took.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.363
Well, uh, for starters,

10:49.365 --> 10:51.895
this, uh, power of attorney
thing you made me sign.

10:51.934 --> 10:53.484
It's gone, ripped up,

10:53.519 --> 10:54.852
never existed.

10:54.886 --> 10:57.287
All right, and I don't
want you to make fun of me

10:57.288 --> 10:58.690
in front of my friends anymore.

10:58.691 --> 10:59.957
You've got it.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.342
Well, what I really want,
Mr. Gaines,

11:02.377 --> 11:05.212
is just for us to get to know
each other better.

11:05.214 --> 11:08.733
Oh, for God sakes, Woody,
I didn't commit murder.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.351
All right, just forget
the whole thing.

11:11.352 --> 11:12.803
Well, no, Woody,
if you want to be friends,

11:12.804 --> 11:14.104
that's-that's fine,
that's fine.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.040
In fact, uh,
we could, uh, oh...

11:16.041 --> 11:17.107
Go fishing?

11:17.108 --> 11:18.544
Yeah, uh, fishing.
Of course, fine.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.895
In fact, why don't we go fishing
in your new boat?

11:21.896 --> 11:23.180
(chuckles):
My new boat?!

11:23.181 --> 11:24.248
Yes.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.536
Really?
In-in fact, uh,

11:25.551 --> 11:29.019
why don't we call it
the S.S. Silence?

11:29.334 --> 11:32.456
Well, I'm sure
we can come up with

11:32.457 --> 11:33.858
a better name than that,
but thanks.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.125
Hooray.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.310
(both chuckle)

11:36.311 --> 11:37.912
You know, I get a
feeling we're gonna be

11:37.913 --> 11:39.847
pretty close from
now on, Mr. Gaines.

11:43.118 --> 11:45.686
Well, Walter...

11:45.720 --> 11:47.421
did he know what we were doing?

11:47.423 --> 11:50.140
Not only does he know,
but he's doing it to me.

11:55.725 --> 12:00.917
REBECCA: Okay, you guys, I'm
trying to get a head count here

12:00.918 --> 12:02.919
so I know how many people
are here for Thanksgiving

12:02.920 --> 12:04.455
so I can have enough turkey.

12:04.456 --> 12:06.607
Oh, easy on the turkey
for me, though, Rebecca,

12:06.608 --> 12:09.744
'cause, uh, those tryptophanes
just put me to sleep.

12:09.778 --> 12:12.146
Get two turkeys.

12:14.249 --> 12:15.716
Norm, are you gonna be here?

12:15.751 --> 12:16.951
Yeah, I might as well.

12:16.952 --> 12:19.121
Vera's spending Thanksgiving
at her mother's.

12:19.122 --> 12:20.404
How come?

12:20.405 --> 12:21.772
Oh, she's still angry
about me asking

12:21.773 --> 12:23.674
whether her father's
dead or alive.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.767
You never know what's going
to tick some people off.

12:27.768 --> 12:30.814
Hey, Normie, I've got
an easy way to find out

12:30.815 --> 12:32.016
whether or not your
father-in-law's,

12:32.017 --> 12:33.467
uh, still alive or not.
Yeah?

12:33.485 --> 12:36.420
Yeah, yeah, you give, uh,
Vera's parents' house a call.

12:36.421 --> 12:38.722
If a guy answers,
bingo, there's your answer.

12:38.723 --> 12:41.325
Huh? I'll tell you what.

12:41.326 --> 12:43.744
I'll look up the number for you
in the directory here.

12:43.745 --> 12:46.647
So what's, uh,
what's Vera's maiden name?

12:46.649 --> 12:49.767
It's, uh...

12:51.069 --> 12:54.005
Damn, this is gonna
get embarrassing.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.908
Could I be having some
severe memory lapse here?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.592
Oh, Norm, quick.

12:58.627 --> 13:00.227
In Herbie The Love Bug, Yeah?

13:00.261 --> 13:01.662
Who played the bad guy?

13:01.713 --> 13:02.913
Keenan Wynn.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.882
Your memory's sound, my friend.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.323
WOODY:
Hey, Sam.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.158
Me and Mr. Gaines
just went fishing

13:15.193 --> 13:16.827
on my new boat.

13:16.861 --> 13:19.096
And guess what we're
doing tomorrow?

13:19.130 --> 13:20.831
Flying to Vermont.

13:20.899 --> 13:22.550
Vermont?
Yeah.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.151
Well, all I did
was ask Mr. Gaines

13:24.152 --> 13:25.520
how maple syrup was made.

13:25.521 --> 13:26.988
And the next thing
you know, boom,

13:26.989 --> 13:28.890
he's firing up the jet.
That's right.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.276
Well, in spite of all
the fun we've been having,

13:32.277 --> 13:33.944
I, I really must run along.

13:33.978 --> 13:35.813
Oh, hey, Mr. Gaines.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.548
What about my hug?

13:37.583 --> 13:39.717
Oh, gee, Woody, I don't know.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.052
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

13:41.053 --> 13:42.954
I don't want to catch one
of those fish hooks in my eye.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.505
On second thought,
come here, son!

13:51.096 --> 13:52.863
Wow. How 'bout that?

13:52.865 --> 13:55.299
You guys are getting
along great, aren't you?

13:55.333 --> 13:56.800
Yep, Sam.

13:56.834 --> 14:00.304
You know, I owe it all
to my little speech.

14:00.338 --> 14:03.674
As soon as I delivered it,
he was putty in my hands.

14:03.675 --> 14:05.076
Well, that's great, man,
that's great.

14:05.077 --> 14:08.145
Yeah.
I noticed, though, you said, uh,

14:08.179 --> 14:12.016
your speech, when, you know,
technically it was my speech.

14:12.034 --> 14:14.618
Remember? Right over there,
I, uh, thought it up.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.654
You may have
thought it up, Sam,

14:16.688 --> 14:18.689
but I'm the one
who made it sing.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.426
Well, whatever.
Congratulations.

14:22.461 --> 14:25.929
Yeah, you know,
when, uh, Woody Boyd talks,

14:25.963 --> 14:28.131
people listen.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.602
Matter of fact, Sam,

14:31.636 --> 14:34.237
I'm gonna do you
a great, big favour.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.843
Mr. Peterson, I'm gonna talk
and you're gonna listen.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.744
It's about your beer tab.

14:40.762 --> 14:43.897
Wood, stay in the shallow end.

14:46.167 --> 14:47.857
Yeah, maybe you're right,
sorry.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.269
Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it! Oh!

14:56.278 --> 14:58.812
Oh, man, this is great.

14:58.846 --> 14:59.980
(TV clicks off)

15:00.015 --> 15:01.348
Norm?
Yeah?

15:01.350 --> 15:03.500
Th-The Barcalounger

15:03.535 --> 15:05.902
is only here
for the day, right?

15:05.937 --> 15:09.906
Thanksgiving just wouldn't
be the same without it, Sam.

15:09.941 --> 15:11.809
Tomorrow it goes back, right?

15:11.843 --> 15:14.445
I mean, you, you signed
this agreement remember?

15:14.446 --> 15:17.965
Sam, what do you think
of all the decorations?

15:17.966 --> 15:19.433
I bought everything
with my own money.

15:19.434 --> 15:21.051
Yeah, you know,
I've been meaning to ask you.

15:21.052 --> 15:24.122
What do skeletons and witches
have to do with Thanksgiving?

15:24.189 --> 15:26.273
Well, uh...

15:26.308 --> 15:30.744
the witches came over
with the Pilgrims.

15:30.779 --> 15:34.748
And then the Pilgrims
burned them all at the stake.

15:34.782 --> 15:37.551
And then, when they
were all burned up,

15:37.586 --> 15:41.088
there was nothing left
of them but skeletons.

15:41.123 --> 15:45.392
And that left the Pilgrims
free to make a big dinner.

15:47.662 --> 15:49.763
They were cheap, huh?

15:49.798 --> 15:53.117
Actually, they were
throwing them out.

15:53.151 --> 15:55.585
Well, it looks, it looks
really nice, Rebecca.

15:55.637 --> 15:57.137
It looks really nice.

15:57.171 --> 15:59.139
Wh-What about the,
uh, the plates?

15:59.140 --> 16:00.942
Oh, I'm going to borrow
those from Melville's.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.659
No, no! Oh, don't do that.
Don't do that.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.662
If-if John Hill finds out,
he'll blow his bald stack.

16:05.681 --> 16:07.181
Oh, don't be silly.

16:07.215 --> 16:09.749
Melville's is closed
and John Hill's at the Cape.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.486
Besides, I'm already using his
oven to cook the turkey.

16:12.487 --> 16:15.289
Well, in that case, uh, why
don't you get some silverware.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.557
I think we've gonna run out
of these sporks.

16:18.860 --> 16:21.095
Well, here we are, Frederick.

16:21.129 --> 16:23.119
♪ Over the river
and through the woods ♪

16:23.131 --> 16:25.933
♪ To the bar stool
on the right. ♪

16:25.967 --> 16:28.903
Ah, the beginnings of a
marvellous Thanksgiving memory.

16:28.937 --> 16:31.438
Say, Norm, uh, the last time
I was at your house,

16:31.472 --> 16:33.007
wasn't this chair red?

16:33.009 --> 16:35.299
Yeah, yeah, I go through
them pretty quickly.

16:37.212 --> 16:39.446
Hi, Frasier.
Hi, Frederick. Hello.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.016
Hey, how do you like the way
I decked the place out?

16:42.100 --> 16:45.268
Well, uh, I must say it looks
rather... festive.

16:45.269 --> 16:47.921
Thank you.
Oh, you're getting plates from Melville's.

16:47.922 --> 16:49.440
You know what would look
beautiful is those, uh,

16:49.441 --> 16:50.874
those gorgeous
candlesticks they have.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.008
Ooh, good idea.

16:52.009 --> 16:53.544
Why don't you go up there
and grab those?

16:53.545 --> 16:55.412
Come here, Frederick.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.714
Well, you guys lucked out.

16:57.715 --> 17:00.150
You get to spend you
Thanksgiving with the Tortellis.

17:00.151 --> 17:01.351
Hide your valuables.

17:03.371 --> 17:05.705
Hey kids, park it over there.

17:05.740 --> 17:08.175
Carla, why'd you only
bring three of your kids?

17:08.175 --> 17:09.292
Well, we have this kind

17:09.294 --> 17:11.194
of Thanksgiving
tradition at our home.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.564
You see, at noon I set
them out on the curb.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.248
Then the various men

17:15.282 --> 17:17.384
they've come to know
as "Dad" drive by,

17:17.419 --> 17:20.121
and who's ever left
comes with me.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.693
Uh... there must
be some mistake here.

17:25.694 --> 17:28.279
Uh... you've got me sitting
at the kiddie table.

17:30.482 --> 17:33.917
Um, no, no,
uh, no mistake Cliff.

17:33.985 --> 17:36.170
Uh, we all decided
that you're the only one

17:36.204 --> 17:39.073
that we trust being
an adult supervisor.

17:39.107 --> 17:42.776
Ah, well, that's another bowl
of stuffing, then, Sammy.

17:42.777 --> 17:44.746
I'll be proud to watch
the little tykes.

17:44.747 --> 17:48.082
So, kiddies...

17:48.116 --> 17:50.617
I ever tell you about
the first Thanksgiving?

17:50.651 --> 17:54.020
Yeah, it took place, uh,
between the ancient Egyptians

17:54.055 --> 17:57.324
and astronauts
from a distant galaxy.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.162
(speaking gibberish)

18:01.213 --> 18:03.063
Oh, thank you, Frederick.

18:05.467 --> 18:07.534
God, I wish I'd had kids.

18:13.574 --> 18:16.610
Food's on!
Come on, everybody.

18:16.611 --> 18:20.280
Hey.
Sit down around the table here.

18:20.282 --> 18:21.831
Listen, here's the good news.

18:21.832 --> 18:23.917
You can make a mess,
and don't worry about

18:23.918 --> 18:26.220
breaking anything, 'cause none
of this stuff belongs to us.

18:26.221 --> 18:28.589
Yay!
Yay! Yay!

18:28.623 --> 18:31.425
Sam why don't you, uh,
make a little toast?

18:31.459 --> 18:32.926
Oh... yeah.

18:32.927 --> 18:34.395
All right, that's a good idea.

18:34.396 --> 18:37.030
Uh, all right, uh...

18:37.064 --> 18:40.000
welcome to, uh,
Thanksgiving at Cheers.

18:40.034 --> 18:41.784
I hope everybody
enjoys the food,

18:41.803 --> 18:45.339
and I'd like to make
a toast right now

18:45.373 --> 18:49.410
to the man who made this all
possible: John Allen Hill.

18:49.444 --> 18:50.944
Oh, now, now, come on.

18:50.945 --> 18:52.012
I-I know what
you're thinking.

18:52.013 --> 18:54.147
But you know,
I tell you the truth

18:54.148 --> 18:56.717
uh, if John and I hadn't gotten
off on the wrong foot

18:56.718 --> 18:58.402
I think we would have
been best of friends.

18:58.403 --> 19:00.471
If he were here right now,
I would, uh,

19:00.472 --> 19:02.439
I'd ask him to sit down
and break bread with us.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.041
But because he isn't, then I say
let's raise our glasses

19:05.042 --> 19:07.978
to that grand old gentleman,
John Allen Hill.

19:08.079 --> 19:11.198
Cheers.
JOHN: Well, isn't this touching?

19:11.200 --> 19:13.283
All the Who's down in Whoville

19:13.317 --> 19:16.453
gathered 'round
their roast beast.

19:16.454 --> 19:19.957
Good heavens, man, I thought
you were at the Cape.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.975
I was until the police
called to tell me

19:22.009 --> 19:24.644
the silent alarm
had gone off upstairs.

19:24.679 --> 19:27.297
Ah, uh, yeah- that was,
that was us, John.

19:27.349 --> 19:28.749
I-I'm sorry, we, uh,

19:28.783 --> 19:31.551
borrowed a few things
for our simple dinner here.

19:31.552 --> 19:32.769
John, I'll tell you what.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.004
Why don't you join us, please?

19:34.005 --> 19:35.138
Please come sit
at my right hand.

19:35.139 --> 19:36.806
No, no, no, thank you.
Please, I couldn't.

19:36.807 --> 19:39.109
But since no harm was done,
I'll be on my way.

19:39.143 --> 19:40.310
Happy Thanksgiving.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.679
And do sterilize everything.

19:45.282 --> 19:47.584
Thank you, John,
and happy Thanksgiving.

19:50.538 --> 19:52.323
So how'd you spot him?

19:52.324 --> 19:54.842
I saw the reflection of his head
in the dessert tray.

19:54.843 --> 19:55.976
Can I have one?

20:01.917 --> 20:05.168
Mr. and Mrs. Woody Boyd.

20:06.755 --> 20:08.455
How was that, sport?

20:09.757 --> 20:11.292
Hi, Daddy.

20:11.343 --> 20:12.626
Hello, pumpkin.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.527
It's good to see you.

20:14.529 --> 20:15.679
Hi, Dad.

20:15.681 --> 20:16.763
Hello, son.

20:16.764 --> 20:20.234
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving!

20:20.235 --> 20:22.069
Hi, Uncle Richard,
Aunt Katherine.

20:22.070 --> 20:23.336
Hello, darling.
GAINES: Richard.

20:23.337 --> 20:24.437
Walter.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.022
Woody.

20:26.023 --> 20:27.725
Certain parties are
here this evening,

20:27.726 --> 20:29.460
and things may
get very delicate.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.328
Oh, don't worry
about a thing, Mr. Gaines.

20:31.329 --> 20:33.196
Boy, she looks familiar.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.682
Now, Woody...

20:35.683 --> 20:37.884
Where have I seen her before?

20:37.886 --> 20:39.636
WOODY: Help me out
here, Mr. Gaines.

20:39.671 --> 20:41.154
I got it!

20:41.189 --> 20:43.090
Uh, everyone
into the dining room.

20:43.091 --> 20:44.959
I can smell that turkey,
it's all ready.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.193
Let's just move along now.

20:46.194 --> 20:48.262
The cranberry sauce
and stuffing,

20:48.263 --> 20:49.296
all the trimmings.

20:49.297 --> 20:50.497
Let's just move right along.

20:50.498 --> 20:51.999
Come on,
move, move, move, move.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.233
Save me a drumstick.

20:53.301 --> 20:56.886
Woody, I thought
we had an understanding.

20:56.921 --> 20:58.971
Now, we went fishing,
took you bowling,

20:58.972 --> 21:01.207
we went to the arcade-
if there's a lower middle class

21:01.208 --> 21:03.042
activity in Boston,
we've done it.

21:04.980 --> 21:06.913
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gaines.

21:06.914 --> 21:08.648
I was just trying
to figure out where I knew

21:08.649 --> 21:10.818
Kelly's aunt from,
and it finally came to me.

21:10.819 --> 21:12.185
Of course it came to you.
You caught me

21:12.186 --> 21:14.038
making love to her
on the floor of my office.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.389
I met her at the wedding.

21:15.423 --> 21:17.891
Caught you what?
Nothing.

21:17.925 --> 21:19.860
Let's eat.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.029
Holy cow,
that's your brother's wife,

21:22.030 --> 21:23.496
and you're having
an affair with her?

21:23.497 --> 21:25.299
Yes.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.267
You really didn't know?
No.

21:27.335 --> 21:29.169
Then you're not
blackmailing me?

21:29.203 --> 21:31.004
I didn't have to buy
your silence?

21:31.089 --> 21:33.740
Well, no, I-I would never
blackmail you, Mr. Gaines.

21:33.741 --> 21:36.243
I mean, I think what you're
doing is disgusting and wrong,

21:36.244 --> 21:37.934
but that's between
you and Satan.

21:38.362 --> 21:41.164
I've got something to tell you.

21:41.165 --> 21:43.433
I think that we can't
be friends anymore.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.601
I don't respect you.

21:44.652 --> 21:46.653
Well, I'll just have to live

21:46.654 --> 21:48.456
with your scorn
and contempt, Woody.

21:48.457 --> 21:50.240
Okay, Mr. Gaines.

21:50.275 --> 21:51.474
I just want you to know,

21:51.475 --> 21:52.777
I'd never blackmail you.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.527
I'd much rather do this.

21:54.528 --> 21:56.429
Hey, everybody, I've got
something to tell you! Uh...

21:56.430 --> 21:57.931
I want the wishbone!

21:59.701 --> 22:00.868
Gotcha.

22:02.704 --> 22:04.905
This is gonna be a fun night.

22:07.224 --> 22:08.959
Dear God...

22:08.993 --> 22:10.761
It's over.

22:10.795 --> 22:14.898
I'm free, finally free.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.534
Your brother's wife, eh, Wally?

22:19.971 --> 22:22.105
Get me a drink.

22:22.139 --> 22:24.407
We have to talk.

22:25.305 --> 22:31.463
