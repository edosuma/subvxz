00:04.504 --> 00:05.672
I'VE BEEN STUDYING
MY MAGIC BOOK.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.006
IT'S JUST TOO HARD.

00:07.073 --> 00:08.341
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.443
AH! HERE'S ONE
FOR SILENCE.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.380
"AFFIX THE TASTE ORGAN

00:15.448 --> 00:17.550
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.285
PUT A CAMEL TONGUE
IN YOUR MOUTH.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.121
IT WORKS, BUT
YOU'LL FIND OUT

00:21.187 --> 00:23.189
WHY CAMELS SPIT SO MUCH.

00:23.256 --> 00:26.025
I THINK I'D ACTUALLY RATHER
BE DOING MY HOMEWORK.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.461
SABRINA, MAGIC IS PART
OF YOUR EDUCATION TOO.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.562
SURE, IT'S HARD WORK

00:29.629 --> 00:31.197
AND IT MIGHT
SEEM DIFFICULT

00:31.264 --> 00:32.499
BUT WITH PLENTY
OF PRACTICE...

00:32.565 --> 00:36.536
OH, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET A STRAW AND SUCK
ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT?

00:36.603 --> 00:38.638
YOU ARE GOING
TO LOVE THIS SECTION.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.407

A RABBIT OUT OF A HAT.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.464
HEY

01:04.531 --> 01:05.598
PUT ME BACK.

01:05.665 --> 01:08.435

IS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.302
OH. SORRY.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.138
RELAX. THAT HAPPENS
A LOT WITH RABBITS.

01:12.205 --> 01:13.840
I DIDN'T KNOW.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.426
UH, AS IF...

HOW'D YOU READ MY

01:53.780 --> 01:56.516

08:04.317 --> 08:07.520
HARVEY, YOU WOULD NOT
BELIEVE WHAT I JUST HEARD.

08:07.587 --> 08:08.654
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.524
THAT'S NOT
SABRINA'S REAL NOSE.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.792
IT'S NOT?

08:12.859 --> 08:13.993
DON'T YOU GET IT?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.661
SHE HAD SURGERY.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.597
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.899
NEVER MIND.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.637
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE
TO YOUR STATIONS.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.639
YOU KNOW WHAT TODAY IS.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.774
IT'S<i> BUNDKUCHEN FREITAG.</i>

08:28.841 --> 08:30.009
IT'S BUNDT FRIDAY.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.512
GET YOUR PANS.

08:33.579 --> 08:35.281
NOW... DID YOU KNOW

08:35.348 --> 08:39.218
THAT RICHARD NIXON'S FAVORITE
SNACK FOOD WAS THE BUNDT?

08:39.285 --> 08:42.021
OH, HE'D EAT IT SECRETLY
AND THEN DENY IT

08:42.088 --> 08:45.024
BUT IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY
TO THOSE TAPES...

08:45.091 --> 08:47.026
SMELL YOUR BUNDTS.

08:47.093 --> 08:49.128
SMELL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S BUNDTS.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.129
MMM...

08:50.196 --> 08:51.697
WE GOT REALLY LUCKY.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.633
OUR DUTCH CHOCOLATE
LOOKS MUCH BETTER

08:53.699 --> 08:55.234
THAN LIBBY'S 14-GRAIN.

08:55.301 --> 08:57.970
MAYBE I'LL OFFER HER
A PIECE OF OUR CAKE.

08:58.037 --> 08:58.971
WHY?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.539
JUST TO SHOW

09:00.606 --> 09:01.741
SHE CAN'T GET TO US.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.744
YOU'RE A MUCH NICER PERSON
THAN I AM.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.548
HI, LIBBY.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.917
EWW.
UGH.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.084
SABRINA.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.020
DO YOU WANT TO TRY
A PIECE OF OUR CAKE?

09:14.086 --> 09:16.589
LIKE I'D TASTE
ANYTHING YOU GAVE ME.

09:16.656 --> 09:17.823
WHAT'S IN IT? POISON?

09:17.890 --> 09:21.127
NO. JUST CHOCOLATE,
LOTS OF CHOCOLATE.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.128
REALLY?

09:22.194 --> 09:23.329
AND SPRINKLES.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.297
OH, ALL RIGHT

09:24.363 --> 09:27.566
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO START BEING NICE TO YOU.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.603
THAT'S OKAY. I JUST WANT
TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.571
LIBBY, WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN SAYING

09:32.638 --> 09:34.573
ABOUT JENNY AND ME
BEHIND OUR BACKS?

09:34.640 --> 09:35.608
LIKE I'D TELL YOU.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.243
OKAY. HERE'S WHAT
I WAS SAYING.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.278
I WAS SAYING
THAT HER FATHER'S IN JAIL

09:39.345 --> 09:40.780
AND THAT SHE
CHEATS ON TAXES

09:40.846 --> 09:43.149
AND THEN I THREW IN
THAT YOU HAD A NOSE JOB.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.583
BUT THOSE ARE ALL LIES.

09:44.650 --> 09:45.885
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME.

09:45.952 --> 09:46.919
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:46.986 --> 09:48.187
I WAS TELLING SABRINA

09:48.254 --> 09:50.089
THE RUMORS
WE'VE BEEN SPREADING.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.591
WHY? SHE'S NOT
IN THE LOOP.

09:52.658 --> 09:53.626
SO?

09:53.693 --> 09:55.194
AND, BY THE WAY,
IT WAS JILL

09:55.261 --> 09:57.096
WHO MADE UP THE
NOSE-JOB STORY

09:57.163 --> 09:58.864
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
VERY FUNNY

09:58.931 --> 10:00.967
BECAUSE, UH, SHE'S
THE ONE WHO...

10:01.033 --> 10:02.768
YOU SWORE YOU'D
NEVER TELL.

10:02.835 --> 10:03.970
AND CEE CEE KISSES

10:04.036 --> 10:06.372
HER PETE SAMPRAS POSTER
EVERY NIGHT.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.674
THOSE WERE SUPER
TOP SECRETS!

10:08.741 --> 10:09.675
YOU SNITCHED!

10:09.742 --> 10:10.509
I HAVE A FEELING

10:10.576 --> 10:13.179
LIBBY WON'T BE SPREADING
ANY MORE LIES.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.214
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.282
PIECE OF CAKE.

10:16.349 --> 10:19.719
DID YOU SEE A CONTAINER
OF SPRINKLES ON THE COUNTER?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.354
YEAH. MRS. BOZIGIAN
TOOK THEM.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.155
SHE PUT THEM ON
ALL THE BUNDTS

10:23.222 --> 10:24.824
THEN SHE LEFT THE ROOM.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.058
GOT TO GO.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.261
MRS. BOZIGIAN?!

10:29.328 --> 10:31.797
MRS. BOZIGIAN...

10:31.864 --> 10:32.865
OH, MY GOODNESS.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.967
OFFERING FREE FOOD
TO TEACHERS--

10:35.034 --> 10:37.003
I'M LUCKY
I DIDN'T LOSE A HAND.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.405
YOU TOOK OUR CAKE
TO THE FACULTY LOUNGE?

10:39.472 --> 10:42.008
YES, AND THE SPRINKLES
WERE A DELIGHTFUL TOUCH.

10:42.074 --> 10:43.142
OH, NO.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.276
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

10:44.343 --> 10:45.644
I THINK I'LL SKIP CLASS.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.380
TRUTH IS, I DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE

10:47.446 --> 10:49.015
ANYMORE THAN
THE KIDS DO.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.283
AND I CAN STILL MAKE
THE FIFTH RACE.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.385
NO. IT'S FINE.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.319
AND WHO KNOWS?

10:53.386 --> 10:56.022
IT MIGHT MAKE THE
WORLD A BETTER PLACE.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.757
THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF BUNDT.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.427
AND YOU SAY YOU'RE A SIZE THREE
WHEN YOU'RE REALLY A SIZE FIVE.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.229
YEAH. WELL, REMEMBER

11:03.295 --> 11:05.698
WHEN I SWORE I
DIDN'T KISS DANNY?

11:05.765 --> 11:07.433
I DID. I LIED.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.434
HI, HARVEY.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.735
HOW'S YOUR CAKE?

11:09.802 --> 11:11.203
GOOD. AND YOU KNOW--

11:11.270 --> 11:13.072
I DIDN'T JUST
TAKE HOME EC

11:13.139 --> 11:14.940
BECAUSE COACH TOLD ME TO.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.075
I LIKE TO COOK.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.676
I LIKE IT A LOT.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.812
HEY!

11:19.879 --> 11:20.679
HEY.

11:20.746 --> 11:21.981
HI.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.450
I SAVED US A PIECE,
WITH SPRINKLES.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.819
MMM... WELL,
YOU GO FIRST.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.458
WOW. IT'S GOOD.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.326
YOU KNOW WHAT
IT TASTES LIKE?

11:34.393 --> 11:36.462
IT TASTES LIKE I LIED
TO YOU YESTERDAY.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.297
YOU LIED TO ME?
ABOUT WHAT?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.432
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D RATHER GO

11:39.498 --> 11:41.767
TO THE SLICERY ALONE
WITH HARVEY TONIGHT.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.302
JUST THE TWO OF YOU?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.304
HARVEY AND I
MIGHT BE SOUL MATES

11:45.371 --> 11:47.039
AND YOU SAID YOU
ONLY LIKED HIM

11:47.106 --> 11:49.742
AS A FRIEND, SO...
YOU DON'T MIND, RIGHT?

11:49.809 --> 11:51.444
YEAH. SURE.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.746
PERFECT. I'LL GO TELL HARVEY
YOU'RE NOT COMING.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.915
SABRINA, YOU DIDN'T GET

11:55.981 --> 11:57.716
ANY CAKE.

11:57.783 --> 12:00.920
NO. I'M... REALLY
NOT VERY HUNGRY.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.803
Man:
LET ME GIVE YOU
THE TRUTH, RICKY.

12:17.870 --> 12:18.971
YOU KIDS COME IN HERE

12:19.038 --> 12:21.273
TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURES,
YOUR DREAMS

12:21.340 --> 12:22.842
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?

12:22.908 --> 12:25.377
YOU THINK I WANTED TO BE
A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR?

12:25.444 --> 12:26.378
HECK, NO.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.881
I WAS BORN TO PLAY THE BLUES.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.382
♪ I GOT NO FUTURE... ♪

12:41.961 --> 12:43.529
I DIDN'T EVEN
TRY TO KISS HER.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.530
YOU DIDN'T?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.798
NAH, I'M NOT READY.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.399
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I'M A VIRGIN?

12:47.466 --> 12:48.901
REALLY? ME TOO?!

12:48.968 --> 12:50.402
EXCELLENT.

12:50.469 --> 12:53.139
I FEEL REALLY AWKWARD
RIGHT NOW.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.341
Attention, students.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.409
This is Principal Larue.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.410
I just wanted to announce

12:58.477 --> 13:01.380
that as soon as I finish
this yummy bundt cake

13:01.447 --> 13:02.915
I'm going to the movies

13:02.982 --> 13:05.084
like I do
every Friday afternoon.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.420
And I'm paying for my popcorn
with petty cash.

13:08.487 --> 13:09.788
(<i> Larue chuckles</i> )

13:09.855 --> 13:11.857
SABRINA!

13:11.924 --> 13:14.093
JENNY SAID YOU WEREN'T
COMING TONIGHT.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.263
(<i> whispering</i> ):
IS IT SOMETHING TO DO
WITH YOUR NOSE?

13:17.329 --> 13:18.898
NO, I JUST CAN'T MAKE IT.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.533
YOU AND JENNY
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.501
I'M LATE FOR THE BUS.

13:22.568 --> 13:26.438
HEY, YOU RUN FUNNY.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.108
STOP WHATEVER
YOU'RE DOING.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.576
THIS IS MORE
IMPORTANT.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.079
I WAS ON THE VERGE OF
A MAJOR SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH.

13:34.146 --> 13:34.947
NOBODY CARES.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.316
OKAY, WHICH LOOK

13:37.383 --> 13:40.553
DO YOU THINK DRELL
WILL LIKE BETTER?

13:40.619 --> 13:41.987
TOUGH CHICK OR...

13:42.054 --> 13:44.390
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS?

13:44.456 --> 13:47.893
TOUGH CHICK OR...

13:47.960 --> 13:50.329
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS?

13:50.396 --> 13:52.898
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
IN THE MIDDLE?

13:52.965 --> 13:54.967
LIKE A TOUGH CHICK IN DISTRESS?

13:55.034 --> 13:57.503
OOH, I LIKE IT.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.971
I HATE IT.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.440
WHY DON'T YOU WEAR WHAT YOU WORE

14:01.507 --> 14:03.142
THE LAST TIME
DRELL STOOD YOU UP?

14:03.209 --> 14:07.179
HE IS NOT GOING
TO STAND ME UP.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.516
WERE YOU COOKING
SOMETHING, ZELDA?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.618
NO. DRELL DID IT AGAIN.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.620
HE SENT YOU A...

14:14.687 --> 14:16.956
HALF A POT ROAST?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.858
THAT JUST MEANS HE'S
GOING TO BE A LITTLE LATE.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.228
OH... HE'S SO THOUGHTFUL.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.629
HEY.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.097
OH, NO.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.565
YOU LOOK UNHAPPY.

14:26.632 --> 14:27.566
TELL ZELDA.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.969
I'VE GOT A DATE.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.136
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:31.203 --> 14:32.304
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.406
HIGH SCHOOL IS NO PLACE
FOR THE TRUTH.

14:34.473 --> 14:37.876
PEOPLE WERE BLURTING OUT
THEIR FEELINGS ALL OVER.

14:37.943 --> 14:40.246
WELL, I WARNED YOU--
THE TRUTH CAN BE UNRULY.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.413
BUT DON'T WORRY.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.983
THE SPRINKLES WEAR OFF
AFTER 24 HOURS.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.351
24 HOURS IS TOO LATE.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.885
IGNORANCE WAS BLISS.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.088
I WAS JUST TOO STUPID
TO KNOW IT.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.523
HI, HARVEY.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.125
HEY, YOU MADE IT.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.927
YEAH, I MADE IT.

14:56.262 --> 14:57.396
WHAT NOW?

14:57.463 --> 14:58.597
YOU WANT TO ORDER PIZZA?

14:58.664 --> 15:00.366
GREAT IDEA.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.134
SO, THIS IS NICE.

15:02.201 --> 15:04.169
JUST THE TWO OF US.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.170
YEAH, NO SABRINA.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.171
IT'S GREAT.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.906
IT IS?

15:07.973 --> 15:09.908
SURE, NOW WE
CAN ORDER ONIONS.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.543
SABRINA HATES ONIONS.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.312
BUT WON'T IT ALSO
GIVE US A CHANCE

15:13.379 --> 15:15.180
TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER BETTER?

15:15.247 --> 15:18.384
YEAH... OR WE COULD
JUST PLAY FOOSBALL.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.252
I'M NOT REALLY INTO SPORTS.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.955
I'D RATHER TALK
ABOUT POETRY AND NATURE.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.057
I'M REALLY
NOT INTO POETRY

15:25.124 --> 15:26.425
BUT NATURE'S OKAY.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.627
I MEAN, I LIKE
GOING OUTSIDE.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.429
ME TOO!

15:30.496 --> 15:32.531
BUT NOT WHEN IT'S COLD.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.166
I DON'T LIKE BEING COLD.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.635
SEE, I'M OKAY WITH COLD.

15:36.702 --> 15:37.569
DO YOU LIKE HOT?

15:37.636 --> 15:40.205
NOT THAT MUCH.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.440
OH.

15:41.507 --> 15:43.709
WHERE IS THAT PIZZA?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.978
WE HAVEN'T
ORDERED IT YET.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.348
SABRINA, MAY I COME IN?

15:49.415 --> 15:51.050
YEAH. I'M JUST PRACTICING
MY MAGIC.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.384
OH, WONDERFUL...

15:52.451 --> 15:54.953
I THINK I'M GETTING
PRETTY GOOD.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.021
OH, NO.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.189
AND WATCH...

15:59.625 --> 16:00.693
TA-DA!

16:00.759 --> 16:02.961
I THINK I'M READY
FOR A CRUISE SHIP.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.096
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.131
WHY AREN'T YOU OUT
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

16:06.198 --> 16:07.433
'CAUSE.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.268
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

16:09.335 --> 16:10.169
NO.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.270
ARE YOU SURE?

16:13.172 --> 16:16.575
COME ON, I THINK
YOU NEED A SNACK.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.743
I'M REALLY NOT HUNGRY.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.011
EAT THIS.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.480
NO, THANKS.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.615
I'D RATHER USE LADY BALD SPOT.

16:23.682 --> 16:25.217
TRUST ME.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.055
SO WHY ARE YOU HOME?

16:30.122 --> 16:31.056
BECAUSE JENNY TOLD ME

16:31.123 --> 16:32.725
SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE
WITH HARVEY

16:32.791 --> 16:34.259
AND I SAID IT WAS OKAY.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.495
AND IS IT OKAY?

16:36.562 --> 16:38.464
YEAH, I GUESS.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.599
NO. NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.101
HARVEY AND JENNY ARE ALONE.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.436
IT SHOULD BE HARVEY AND ME
OR JENNY AND ME

16:44.503 --> 16:46.038
BUT NOT HARVEY AND JENNY.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.539
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

16:47.606 --> 16:50.008
TELL JENNY JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.643
IF I CAN REMEMBER IT.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.644
THANKS, AUNT ZELDA.

16:52.711 --> 16:53.746
YOU'RE WELCOME, DEAR.

16:53.812 --> 16:55.147
OH, AND BY THE WAY--

16:55.714 --> 16:57.583
THAT DRESS IS REALLY UGLY.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.755
SLICE NUMBER SEVEN.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.124
THIS ONE'S FOR THE TEAM.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.527
LOOK, I MADE A SWAN.

17:08.594 --> 17:09.695
THANKS.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.636
I'VE COME TO SPEAK THE TRUTH.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.804
SABRINA!
YOU MADE IT!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.205
WE NEED TO TALK!

17:20.272 --> 17:21.306
RIGHT AWAY!

17:21.373 --> 17:22.808
YOU SHOULD KNOW
WE ORDERED ONIONS.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.042
WHAT IS IT?

17:24.109 --> 17:25.411
I LIED TO YOU
WHEN I SAID

17:25.477 --> 17:27.146
I DIDN'T MIND
YOU AND HARVEY

17:27.212 --> 17:27.813
COMING HERE ALONE.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.681
YOU MIGHT BE SOUL MATES...

17:29.748 --> 17:30.783
WE'RE NOT SOUL MATES.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.184
YOU'RE NOT?

17:32.251 --> 17:34.086
NO. HARVEY'S
REALLY CUTE AND NICE

17:34.153 --> 17:36.121
BUT YOU CAN'T BUILD
A LIFE ON THAT.

17:36.188 --> 17:38.690
I'D BE WILLING
TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.159
YOU GUYS TALKING
ABOUT ME?

17:40.225 --> 17:41.160
YES!
YES!

17:41.226 --> 17:42.728
COME TALK ABOUT ME OVER HERE.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.396
I WAS JUST TELLING
SABRINA

17:44.463 --> 17:46.832
WHAT A CRUMMY TIME
WE HAD WITHOUT HER.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.334
YEAH, SHE CAN'T
EVEN PLAY FOOSBALL.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.602
YOU KNOW, HARVEY

17:50.669 --> 17:51.837
I THINK I LIKED YOU BETTER

17:51.904 --> 17:53.839
WHEN YOU WERE DISTANT
AND MYSTERIOUS.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.707
UP CLOSE,
YOU'RE A LOUD CHEWER.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.177
SOMETIMES I PUT PIECES
OF PAPER IN YOUR HAIR

17:58.243 --> 17:59.645
AND YOU DON'T
EVEN NOTICE.

17:59.711 --> 18:03.182
ISN'T THIS GREAT--
US BEING HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.454
(<i> whistling</i> )

18:10.789 --> 18:12.324
DO YOU LOVE MY HAIR?

18:12.391 --> 18:15.294
I SEE YOU WENT WITH THE
LITTLE BLACK FEATHER... THING.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.628
YES.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.530
AND NOW I'M OFF
TO THE LINEN CLOSET

18:18.597 --> 18:21.600
WHERE I WILL TRAVEL TO ANOTHER
DIMENSION OF TIME AND SPACE

18:21.667 --> 18:23.502
TO HAVE A LOVELY DATE
WITH DRELL.

18:23.569 --> 18:24.503
DON'T WAIT UP.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.137
STOP!

18:25.204 --> 18:27.439
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY.

18:27.506 --> 18:30.375
I KNOW I SAID THAT DRELL
WOULD STAND YOU UP

18:30.442 --> 18:32.845
AND THIS DATE
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN

18:32.911 --> 18:34.813
AND... I WAS WRONG.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.115
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

18:37.182 --> 18:38.183
WILL YOU SAY IT AGAIN?

18:38.250 --> 18:39.618
NO.

18:39.685 --> 18:40.819
LOOK, JUST HAVE FUN.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.754
AFTER ALL YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH WITH DRELL

18:42.821 --> 18:44.189
YOU DESERVE A GOOD TIME.

18:44.256 --> 18:44.890
THANKS. BYE.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.425
GOT TO GO.

18:46.492 --> 18:48.694
I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP DRELL WAITING.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.896
ALTHOUGH IT IS
KIND OF A FUNNY IMAGE.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.264
DRELL... WAITING.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.671
I JUST HAD THE BEST IDEA.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.440
I'M NOT GOING.

19:01.507 --> 19:01.974
WHAT?!

19:02.040 --> 19:03.475
I'M STANDING DRELL UP.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.810
I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM

19:04.877 --> 19:06.612
A TASTE
OF HIS OWN POT ROAST.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.913
OH, HILDA,
THAT'S PERFECT.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.816
THOSE SELF-HELP BOOKS
ARE REALLY PAYING OFF.

19:10.883 --> 19:11.884
I KNOW.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.886
NOW, LOCK ME IN MY BEDROOM

19:13.952 --> 19:15.621
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.425
NOW IT'S TWO GAMES APIECE.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.727
HEY, HARVEY

19:21.793 --> 19:23.896
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

19:23.962 --> 19:27.833
SURE. TONIGHT WE HAVE
NO SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.601
WELL, IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL

19:29.668 --> 19:31.637
BUT I'VE WANTED
TO TELL YOU THIS

19:31.703 --> 19:33.305
FOR THE LONGEST TIME.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.707
YOU HAVE THE WORLD'S
MOST PERFECT SIDEBURNS.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.276
REALLY?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.278
YEAH, AND ONE
MORE THING.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.112
YEAH?

19:40.178 --> 19:44.283
ONIONS GIVE YOU
REALLY BAD BREATH.

19:45.484 --> 19:49.821
OH, I WISH MY FUR HAD
AN ELASTIC WAISTBAND.

19:49.888 --> 19:50.956
(<i> burps</i> )

19:51.023 --> 19:53.258
WELL, STOP EATING.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.793
I CAN'T.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.461
HELLO, HELLO,
HELLO.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.496
HI, HI, HI.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.830
HOW DID IT GO?

19:58.897 --> 19:59.932
GREAT.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.633
THE TRUTH SPRINKLES
SET ME FREE.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.869
BUT THEY WEREN'T
TRUTH SPRINKLES.

20:03.936 --> 20:04.903
SURPRISE!

20:04.970 --> 20:06.772
I GAVE YOU
ICE CREAM SPRINKLES.

20:06.838 --> 20:07.806
YOU LIED TO ME?

20:07.873 --> 20:10.309
NO, I...
OKAY, I DID.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.978
BUT, BUT, THE POINT IS,
I WANTED YOU TO LEARN

20:13.045 --> 20:15.514
THE TRUTH IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD FIND

20:15.581 --> 20:16.548
WITHOUT MAGIC.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.283
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.051
I TOLD HARVEY HE HAD

20:19.117 --> 20:21.253
THE WORLD'S MOST
PERFECT SIDEBURNS

20:21.320 --> 20:21.987
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.522
I AM SO EMBARRASSED.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.458
OH, YOU SHOULD NEVER
BE EMBARRASSED
BY THE TRUTH.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.693
OH, YEAH?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.828
THEN WHY DID YOU
CHANGE YOUR DRESS?

20:33.432 --> 20:35.467
HEY, YOU GUYS WANT
TO HAVE LUNCH TODAY?

20:35.534 --> 20:36.969
AS LONG AS SABRINA
COMES ALONG.

20:37.035 --> 20:37.970
SURE.

20:38.036 --> 20:38.971
COOL.
COOL.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.238
COOL.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.008
HI, LIBBY.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.344
SO WHERE ARE JILL
AND CEE CEE?

20:45.410 --> 20:46.378
LIKE I CARE.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.647
WE ARE
NO LONGER FRIENDS.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.249
HI, LIBBY.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.384
NICE OUTFIT.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.919
AND I LOVE THOSE PANTS.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.721
WHAT ARE THEY, SIZE THREE?

20:55.787 --> 20:56.788
YOU KNOW IT.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.457
WHERE HAVE
YOU TWO BEEN?

21:01.526 --> 21:03.261
Attention, students.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.464
This is
the<i> real</i> Principal Larue.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.033
Last Friday, some prankster
broke into my office

21:08.100 --> 21:09.801
and impersonated me.

21:09.868 --> 21:12.671
I, of course, was
at the District Office all day

21:12.738 --> 21:15.540
working to make your school
a better place.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.908
Thank you.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.011
You think they bought that?

21:19.077 --> 21:20.012
Huh? Uh...

21:20.078 --> 21:21.947
Oh... oh, no.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.286
I'LL MISS YOU, TRICIA.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.326
SEE YOU SOON,
SAMANTHA.

21:38.897 --> 21:40.332
TAKE CARE, BRIAN.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.605
GOOD-BYE,
BERNADETTE.
