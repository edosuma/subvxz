WEBVTT

00:02.674 --> 00:05.586
Aw, babe, you've gone crazy.

00:05.705 --> 00:07.106
The only thing I am crazy about

00:07.141 --> 00:10.710
is a magnificent, pregnant
manta ray named Ann Perkins.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.478
I am ranking
topics of conversation

00:12.513 --> 00:13.713
for our next phone call.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.281
The worst part
about your best friend

00:15.316 --> 00:17.884
living in another stupid state
is the topics really pile up.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.886
What do you think
should be higher priority?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.321
Infinity scarves

00:21.355 --> 00:23.056
or whether or not it's worth it
for me to get Showtime?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.857
Is this really necessary?

00:24.892 --> 00:26.492
When she moved,
we promised each other

00:26.527 --> 00:28.828
that we would talk every day,
and we've really fallen behind.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.030
I know your female friends
are very important to you,

00:31.065 --> 00:33.499
but I'm always
a good sounding board.

00:33.534 --> 00:38.037
I mean, I can talk about
Sandra Bullock skirt length.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.106
No, no, babe, you can't--you
would just embarrass yourself.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.774
Plus, every time
I start talking to you,

00:41.809 --> 00:43.610
five seconds later,
I want to jump your bones.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.011
Oh, let's do that instead.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.982
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.249
- Yeah, okay, let's do this. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.253

01:10.471 --> 01:12.272
On to the unity concert.

01:12.306 --> 01:16.042
Ben is meeting with the tent
people to finalize those deals.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.944
April and Donna
will be helping me

01:17.978 --> 01:19.279
with the vendor location charts,
and I will be meeting

01:19.313 --> 01:21.581
with the surveyors
about the concert grounds.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.717
I would like to volunteer
to do the park survey myself.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.718
Wow, Ron.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.487
I always knew there would be

01:27.521 --> 01:28.988
a day when I would
get through to you

01:29.023 --> 01:31.257
and you would love
government work.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.825
Today is that historic day.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.062
Yes.
That is what has happened.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.766
Spending the day outside alone
sounds like a dream.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.436
I love being a father, but there
are a few things I miss.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.706
Silence, the absence of noise,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.609
one single moment
undisturbed by the sounds

01:49.643 --> 01:53.980
of a children's TV program
called <i> Doc McStuffins.</i>

01:54.014 --> 01:56.683
There is no quiet anymore.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.953
There is only <i> Doc McStuffins.</i>

01:59.987 --> 02:01.321
Sorry I'm late.
[Panting]

02:01.355 --> 02:03.556
Uh, Andy, why don't you go
with Ron and help him?

02:03.590 --> 02:05.124
- I really don't need--
- Shotgun!

02:05.159 --> 02:07.794
I call shotgun. Where are we
going? Doesn't matter. Shotgun.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.095
Shotgun on all rides
for the rest of the day.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.532
For the rest of my life.
In any car! Ha ha!

02:12.566 --> 02:14.300
I just faced you suckers!

02:14.335 --> 02:16.769
So I'll see you
in the parking lot, Ron. Later!

02:16.804 --> 02:19.272
Is the tent guy
left-handed or right-handed?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.740
I just need to know
which way to part my hair

02:20.774 --> 02:22.442
to get us a better price.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.977
It's a business theory
I'm working on.

02:24.011 --> 02:24.978
I really don't
think it matters.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.279
Pretty straightforward deal.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.981
A straightforward deal?
Why didn't you tell me?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.975
I don't have my straightforward
deal fedora on me.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.184
We gotta stop by my storage unit
on the way up.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.585
Hey, Larry.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.355
Hey, you wanna come with us
to tent world? Little road trip?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.356
Tent world?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.791
Yeah, let me grab my lunch.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.560
No. Why'd you invite Larry?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.061
He's been doing
all the paperwork for this deal.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.496
He deserves to come.

02:43.530 --> 02:46.399
Remember you said that
when Larry's farting up the car.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.334
Larry isn't that bad.
He's nice.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.737
And frankly, I don't care
who knows that I said that,

02:50.771 --> 02:54.173
as long as no one knows
that I said that.

02:54.208 --> 02:57.877
Okay, ladies, I will be in my
office for one to seven hours

02:57.911 --> 03:00.580
for my weekly chat with Ann.
I brought some fresh snacks.

03:00.614 --> 03:03.650
And I made a backup plan
for the vendor chart

03:03.684 --> 03:05.652
in case, you know,
yours isn't good.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.020
Actually, Ann called
while you were in the bathroom.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.014
She said something came up,
she'll call you later.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.223
I don't know, I told her
to leave you a voice mail.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.058
Ugh! God, why'd you
let me say all that?

03:12.092 --> 03:14.260
I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!
I'm coming!

03:14.295 --> 03:18.097
Listen to me very carefully.
I have not been taken.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.533
I know that's always your first
fear when I'm not available,

03:20.567 --> 03:23.102
but this is not
a Liam Neeson <i> Taken</i> scenario.

03:23.137 --> 03:25.104
That's exactly
what they'd make you say.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.073
Also, no one's
making me say this.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.742
I am a free woman, untaken,
simply going about my business.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.178
I just have to run.
Something came up.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.780
I love you,
and I'll call you later.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.282
Donna.
[Snaps]

03:36.317 --> 03:37.283
What's good, baby?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.252
What's going down in Donna town?

03:39.286 --> 03:41.888
What's the haps
in Meagle-wood?

03:41.922 --> 03:43.589
I'm listening
to <i>Jaleel Or No Deal.</i>

03:43.624 --> 03:45.825
It's a podcast where
the kid who played Urkel

03:45.859 --> 03:47.460
reviews old
<i>Deal Or No Deal</i> episodes.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.595
It's pointless, and I love it.

03:48.629 --> 03:49.896
Okay, don't let me interrupt.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.931
April, what's the 411,
little mama?

03:51.966 --> 03:54.133
What's the hot goss?
Who you crushing on these days?

03:54.168 --> 03:56.102
Ew, my husband, weirdo.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.971
Can I get back to work now?
Thanks. Bye.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.840
[Sighs]
Work? You can work whenever.

04:00.875 --> 04:04.444
Except for now,
because now is lady time.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.112
You sound like
a tampon commercial.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.581
I'm setting up
an impromptu Galentine's day.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.150
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.385
Wait, I thought you weren't
gonna do Galentine's day

04:12.419 --> 04:14.754
this year because
that she-beast moved away.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.822
I believe her name was Satan?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.992
Her name is Ann,
and she is gone,

04:19.026 --> 04:21.527
and I have accepted it, and we
are gonna have Galentine's day.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.562
Ladies, up front.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.964
I need an Ann
who lives in Pawnee,

04:24.999 --> 04:27.233
and there is no
one obvious candidate,

04:27.268 --> 04:30.670
so I will test them out
on the ultimate battlefield

04:30.704 --> 04:33.907
of female friendship--
Galentine's day brunch.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.843
It will be a women's-only
marathon bonding session

04:36.877 --> 04:38.511
with tons of whipped cream.

04:38.545 --> 04:41.147
Side note,
do not Google that phrase.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.685
Hey, Ron.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.687
Can I ask you
kind of an important question?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.256
You know, like,
when you go to the ATM

04:50.291 --> 04:53.359
and you get money,
is there an actual guy

04:53.394 --> 04:55.995
standing behind the wall who
slides dollar bills in there?

04:56.030 --> 04:57.997
- No.
- Yeah.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.432
It's robots.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.701
Oh, actually, you know what?
I do have a serious question.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.036
In the movie <i> Predator,</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:06.406
can you rub any kind
of mud on yourself

05:06.440 --> 05:08.541
to prevent predator
from seeing you

05:08.575 --> 05:09.876
with his thermal
heat signature sight,

05:09.910 --> 05:11.210
or is it more--

05:11.245 --> 05:12.946
Ow!
That sucks.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.347
Are you hurt?

05:14.381 --> 05:18.484
[Groans]
No. All good. All good.

05:18.519 --> 05:22.255
Oops. Except for my mouth.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.725
Oh, whoa.
Five-second rule.

05:25.759 --> 05:26.993
No, ahh.

05:27.027 --> 05:31.364
Come on, we better
get you to a dentist.

05:31.398 --> 05:35.068
Oh, my God, Larry. Your tuna
fish sandwich stunk up my suit.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.769
- Gayle made it for me.
- Irrelevant.

05:36.804 --> 05:39.172
You know what? Stay out here and
double-check these deal memos.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.673
If you get through 'em,
triple-check 'em.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.408
Just don't come inside.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.545
Sounds good. I will finish
my sandwich and enjoy the view.

05:47.948 --> 05:48.915
Hey, Harvey.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.783
Ben Wyatt.
We spoke on the phone.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.419
Yeah. Yeah, we sure did. Okay.
[Chuckles]

05:53.454 --> 05:54.554
Who's this little genie
right here?

05:54.588 --> 05:56.389
Tom Haverford,
Pawnee business liaison.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.957
[Chuckles] Okay.

05:57.992 --> 06:00.360
Got your contracts
for you right here.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.863
Wow. It's a lot thicker than
the original one-page version.

06:03.898 --> 06:06.299
I take tents pretty seriously,
Ben, I'm a tent guy.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.836
I got over 1,300 tents
in this warehouse alone.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.205
900 of those are
over 2,000 square feet,

06:12.239 --> 06:13.706
80 of 'em are striped,

06:13.741 --> 06:17.277
and exactly 4 of 'em were
once rented by Miss Rene Russo.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.212
- Whoa!
- Yeah. No doy.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.614
I think I know what I'm doing.
[Sniffs]

06:21.649 --> 06:24.050
So I added a few syllables
and whatnot.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.753
Clauses, et cetera.
Addendums, what have you.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.221
Why don't we go ahead
and sign that for me?

06:28.255 --> 06:31.724
Yeah, I think we're gonna
need to take a look at this.

06:31.759 --> 06:35.828
Hmm. So I guess this is not
a straightforward deal.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.431
[Hat thuds]

06:38.465 --> 06:40.733
Shauna, I'm so glad
you could make it.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.135
You're so tan.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.238
Oh, thanks. I just got back
from a solo trip to Rome.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.674
I was gonna go with my
boyfriend, but he couldn't come

06:47.708 --> 06:50.243
because he decided
to stay with his wife.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.578
Oof.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.414
I love Rome.
It's such a great place.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.250
Rome's played out.
Have y'all been to Kuala Lumpur?

06:57.284 --> 06:59.786
- When did you go to Asia?
- I go all the time.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.287
Where do you think I got

07:01.322 --> 07:02.455
that crystal Buddha head
above my jacuzzi?

07:02.489 --> 07:04.858
You have a jacuzzi?
Good to know.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.332
Prospects
for new Pawnee best friend.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.262
Donna Meagle. Confident,
worldly, we go way back.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.599
April Ludgate. Vivid
imagination, young, and vibrant.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.833
Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.635
Pretty, fragile,
makes terrible life decisions.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.370
A real fixer-upper, but look,

07:17.404 --> 07:19.172
it's not like Ann was doing
so hot when I met her.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.441
Ethel Beavers.
Bit of a dark horse.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.709
Crotchety, but probably wise.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.878
And then we got Evelyn,
aka fake Ann.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.982
I don't know her last name.
Honestly we just needed bodies.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.017
Thank you, everyone, for getting
together on such short notice,

07:31.051 --> 07:33.653
and happy Galentine's day.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.455
Now, this is not technically
the right date,

07:35.489 --> 07:38.791
but any time a group of women
get together for brunch,

07:38.826 --> 07:40.894
we embody the spirit
of the holiday.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.395
Today we will
celebrate friendship,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.163
spend a few hours together,

07:44.198 --> 07:46.399
and answer a couple
of questions I've compiled.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.234
Just for fun.
Nothing serious.

07:48.269 --> 07:50.170
But please answer them
with complete honesty

07:50.204 --> 07:51.537
'cause I'll be able
to tell if you're lying.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.906
- To girlfriends!
- Yay.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.742
- Girlfriends.
- Whoo-hoo!

07:55.806 --> 07:58.991
Okay, it's time for
a little Galentine's day Q&A.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.476
Donna, you pick first.

08:01.184 --> 08:04.252
"What is
your favorite TV show?"

08:04.821 --> 08:06.822
Well, for live tweeting,
it's <i> Scandal.</i>

08:06.856 --> 08:09.758
For binge watching,
it's <i> Scandal.</i>

08:09.792 --> 08:12.361
But for fashion,
it's actually <i> Scandal.</i>

08:12.395 --> 08:13.428
My answer is <i> Scandal.</i>

08:13.463 --> 08:14.630
Hmm. April?

08:14.664 --> 08:16.465
Ooh, I love watching

08:16.499 --> 08:19.268
Russian traffic accidents
on YouTube

08:19.302 --> 08:21.801
while I play children's music
at the wrong RPM.

08:21.921 --> 08:23.338
I like beauty pageants.

08:23.373 --> 08:26.041
Everyone is so happy
and perfect.

08:26.075 --> 08:30.445
I like <i>Diagnosis Murder.</i>
And skin flicks.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.556
Can anybody top me off?

08:32.676 --> 08:34.984
The correct answer
for favorite TV show

08:35.104 --> 08:36.885
is <i> Friday Night Lights.</i>

08:36.919 --> 08:39.188
- The correct answer?
- Next question.

08:39.222 --> 08:41.490
Okay, this contract is insane.

08:41.524 --> 08:45.060
It costs extra to have people
inside the tents?

08:45.094 --> 08:46.962
And what's a flap tax?

08:46.996 --> 08:48.363
Well, you need flaps, bro.

08:48.398 --> 08:50.299
A tent without flaps
is basically a parachute.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.100
An unfolding charge?

08:52.135 --> 08:54.369
A noise damage waiver?
How can noise damage tents?

08:54.404 --> 08:57.039
Shh. Keep your voice down,
please, there's tents here.

08:57.073 --> 09:00.375
Now, look, you can argue
with me all you want,

09:00.410 --> 09:03.078
but for every line item that
you two idiots disagree with,

09:03.112 --> 09:05.514
there's gonna be
a $50 discussion surcharge.

09:05.548 --> 09:06.515
What are we up to, doll?

09:06.549 --> 09:07.749
$400.

09:07.784 --> 09:09.918
A discussion surcharge?
That's nuts.

09:09.953 --> 09:11.520
$450.

09:11.554 --> 09:12.554
That's it. Deal's off.

09:12.589 --> 09:14.056
We'll take our business
elsewhere.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.692
Suit yourself, gentlemen.
Sorry we couldn't make a deal.

09:18.561 --> 09:22.764
Wait, wait.
Let me try one more thing.

09:22.799 --> 09:24.433
What's the price now?

09:24.467 --> 09:28.871
$80 more.
I liked it better the other way.

09:28.905 --> 09:31.940
Does have an effect, though.

09:31.975 --> 09:33.375
The receptionist says
she'll fit you in

09:33.409 --> 09:35.043
as soon as there's an opening.

09:35.078 --> 09:37.513
If you're all right,
I'm gonna head back to the park.

09:37.547 --> 09:39.281
Wait, wait, wait,
real quick, real quick.

09:39.315 --> 09:41.783
Do you know what
my social security number is?

09:41.818 --> 09:44.386
Or if I'm allergic to anything?

09:44.420 --> 09:46.455
I don't like corn.
Should I put that down?

09:46.489 --> 09:51.126
Or will that be confusing?
Because I do like candy corn.

09:51.161 --> 09:54.196
Oh, Ron. What a mess.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.298
[Groans]

09:56.332 --> 09:57.933
Here, let me help you.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.968
All I wanted was two hours

10:00.003 --> 10:02.571
where I got to forget
that I was a parent.

10:02.605 --> 10:06.575
Ron, look.
I found all three differences.

10:06.609 --> 10:09.011
Those are two
completely different pictures.

10:10.780 --> 10:12.915
- "Ladies' choice."
- Ooh! Wild card option.

10:12.949 --> 10:13.916
Okay, anybody reveal anything
about their life,

10:13.950 --> 10:15.117
anything at all.

10:15.151 --> 10:17.586
- I've gotten two annulments.
- [Gasps]

10:17.620 --> 10:19.288
One for pleasure, and one

10:19.322 --> 10:22.658
to cap off a long con I was
running against Keith Sweat.

10:22.692 --> 10:23.659
Wow. Ethel, have you--

10:23.693 --> 10:25.661
Okay, Ethel's asleep.
Shauna?

10:25.695 --> 10:28.363
I'm writing a memoir
based on my blog.

10:28.398 --> 10:29.998
It's called
<i>Tweeping Up Appearances,</i>

10:30.033 --> 10:32.601
and it's about my journey
to find happiness

10:32.635 --> 10:34.469
by smiling through the pain.

10:34.504 --> 10:35.971
Okay, I can work with that.

10:36.005 --> 10:38.774
Knope, what you got
going on in that notebook?

10:38.808 --> 10:41.844
Just jotting down memories
in my trusty old journal.

10:41.878 --> 10:44.847
"Friendship rankings."
What's that?

10:44.881 --> 10:46.148
It's not what it sounds like.

10:46.182 --> 10:47.516
It's simply a way
for me to figure out

10:47.550 --> 10:50.118
which one of you is the best.

10:50.153 --> 10:51.320
That's messed up.

10:51.354 --> 10:53.989
Yeah, that is really lame,
and I'm leaving.

10:54.023 --> 10:55.357
You're better than that, Knope.

10:55.391 --> 10:57.593
Donna, why are you angry?
You were in first place.

10:57.627 --> 11:02.097
Bye, everyone.
This was a really...

11:02.131 --> 11:04.132
brunch.
Leave the bag.

11:04.167 --> 11:08.303
If you do this
again next year, don't call me.

11:09.472 --> 11:11.340
Well, by default, it's Shauna.

11:11.374 --> 11:13.775
That's how you want to find
your new best friend, right?

11:13.810 --> 11:16.478
By default?

11:16.513 --> 11:19.515
My pores are clogged up from
being in that dusty warehouse.

11:19.549 --> 11:23.118
I'm gonna check if this gas
station has some biore strips.

11:23.153 --> 11:25.788
Aw, thanks, Larry,
that's nice of you.

11:25.822 --> 11:27.389
Gayle always has me
do the windshield.

11:27.423 --> 11:29.458
She likes to stand
behind me and watch.

11:29.492 --> 11:32.895
According to her,
it's the best view.

11:32.929 --> 11:36.465
- How is Gayle?
- Oh, wonderful.

11:36.499 --> 11:39.968
- And the girls?
- They're good.

11:40.003 --> 11:42.571
- Why do you want to know?
- I'm genuinely interested.

11:42.605 --> 11:44.039
I'm sorry.

11:44.073 --> 11:47.709
I'm just not used to people from
the office asking me things.

11:47.744 --> 11:50.312
It's kind of scary.
But in a good way, though.

11:50.346 --> 11:51.847
[Both chuckle]

11:51.881 --> 11:54.583
Aw, man,
did I miss a Larry fart?

11:54.617 --> 11:56.218
Oh, no, uh, we were just--

11:56.252 --> 11:59.087
Yeah, Tom.
Yeah, I-I really ripped one.

11:59.122 --> 12:02.157
Didn't I, Ben?

12:02.192 --> 12:04.660
Yeah. [Chuckles]
Yeah, it was loud.

12:04.694 --> 12:07.329
Smells like a hippopotamus
took a dump on a skunk.

12:07.363 --> 12:08.397
[Chuckles]

12:08.431 --> 12:11.834
It's in your best interest.

12:11.868 --> 12:16.772
Well, the numbers don't lie.
I'm a goofus, not a gallant.

12:18.942 --> 12:21.276
Been here forever.
Can we go?

12:21.311 --> 12:23.712
Don't you want
to get your tooth fixed?

12:23.746 --> 12:26.782
I don't know, I think my tooth
looks fine just like this.

12:26.816 --> 12:29.418
Well, my grandmother
was missing that tooth,

12:29.452 --> 12:34.256
and she was the most beautiful
woman on her oil rig.

12:34.290 --> 12:37.392
You are an adult.
I am not your dad.

12:37.427 --> 12:41.263
- If you want to go, we can go.
- Yay. Thanks, Ron.

12:41.297 --> 12:44.032
That's why you know even though
you're not my dad,

12:44.067 --> 12:45.767
you're like
an old brother to me.

12:45.802 --> 12:50.305
Like a cool uncle, but old.
Like a grandpa.

12:50.340 --> 12:52.741
But cool like a son.

12:55.861 --> 12:57.222
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

12:57.247 --> 12:58.213
No problem.

12:58.248 --> 12:59.615
That'll be $8, please.

12:59.649 --> 13:01.583
What, you're charging us
for coffee?

13:01.618 --> 13:03.785
What kind of a business--
uh-oh.

13:03.820 --> 13:04.987
Oh, hello, gentlemen.

13:05.021 --> 13:07.723
Gotta be kidding me.
You own this place too?

13:07.757 --> 13:09.925
That's right, dickweed.
You wanna talk deal?

13:09.959 --> 13:11.426
Because my prices have gone up

13:11.461 --> 13:14.062
ever so slightly
since I saw you last.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.597
No, we're not giving in
to your crazy demands.

13:15.632 --> 13:17.433
There are plenty of other
tent rental places

13:17.467 --> 13:18.901
within driving distance.

13:18.935 --> 13:20.769
Yeah, I'm calling
Tent Emporium right now.

13:20.803 --> 13:22.304
[Phone rings]
Tent Emporium.

13:22.338 --> 13:23.772
How can I help you, buttface?

13:23.807 --> 13:25.340
- What?
- Come on.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.942
Yes.

13:26.976 --> 13:28.744
I own every tent store
in Southern Indiana.

13:28.778 --> 13:31.346
Tent Town, Rent Ten Tents,
the Tent Offensive,

13:31.381 --> 13:33.582
and Ace Tentura Tent Detective.

13:33.616 --> 13:35.217
I also own a chick-fil-a
franchise,

13:35.251 --> 13:37.019
but that's not doing
so hot right now. Whatever.

13:37.053 --> 13:39.421
Let's get outta here.
[Phone rings]

13:39.455 --> 13:42.991
You've reached the Tentagon.
How can I help you, buttface?

13:43.026 --> 13:45.027
Okay, here's an idea.
Why don't we find something,

13:45.061 --> 13:48.163
anything, no matter how small,
that we have in common?

13:48.198 --> 13:49.865
For example, I'm an only child.

13:49.899 --> 13:50.866
Me too.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.367
Although, when I was in college

13:52.402 --> 13:54.603
I found out that my dad
had a second family.

13:54.637 --> 13:57.506
Well, we were the second family,
technically.

13:57.540 --> 13:59.441
Okay, well,
we both went to college.

13:59.476 --> 14:00.776
- There's that.
- Yeah.

14:00.810 --> 14:02.911
[Phone rings]
[Gasps] Oh, my God!

14:02.946 --> 14:04.980
Ann had her baby!
Wow, this has been fun.

14:05.014 --> 14:06.448
The bill is already paid.

14:06.483 --> 14:09.985
May I gently suggest that you
check out Chris Traeger's

14:10.019 --> 14:12.621
wonderful therapist
Dr. Richard Nygard.

14:12.655 --> 14:14.389
Although there is a tiny
part of me that always thought

14:14.424 --> 14:15.624
it was just Chris
talking into a mirror.

14:15.658 --> 14:17.259
Anyway, maybe you should
look him up.

14:17.293 --> 14:18.614
I don't know,
I read a book once

14:18.628 --> 14:20.295
that said a woman should never
make the first move.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.364
That doesn't apply to therapy.
Okay. Good luck!

14:24.787 --> 14:27.622
Oliver Perkins-Traeger,
meet your Aunt Leslie.

14:27.656 --> 14:31.960
Hey! Oh, he's so beautiful.
And you're so beautiful.

14:31.994 --> 14:34.129
I mean, you're always beautiful,
but right now you are

14:34.163 --> 14:36.398
the most beautiful,
glowing sun goddess ever.

14:36.432 --> 14:38.566
Why didn't you tell me
you were in labor?

14:38.601 --> 14:40.735
Well, 'cause I knew you'd
drop everything and rush here,

14:40.770 --> 14:42.070
and contractions
can sometimes go for days.

14:42.104 --> 14:43.405
Thank you.

14:43.439 --> 14:45.540
So I didn't want you to be
stuck waiting around.

14:45.574 --> 14:47.542
Well, I'm glad I'm here now.
Where's Chris?

14:47.576 --> 14:49.644
Oh, he was such a good coach
that the nurses asked him

14:49.679 --> 14:52.314
to help out with a delivery
down the hall.

14:52.348 --> 14:53.515
[Slurping]
Ow.

14:53.549 --> 14:56.084
[Continues slurping] Ow.

14:56.118 --> 14:57.385
Ow!

14:57.420 --> 15:00.055
Andrew, you need
to get your tooth fixed.

15:00.089 --> 15:01.623
No way.
I'm not going back there.

15:01.657 --> 15:02.924
I already won
all the magazine mazes.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.393
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

15:05.428 --> 15:06.695
Ow!

15:06.729 --> 15:07.696
If you don't
take care of the problem now,

15:07.730 --> 15:08.964
it's only gonna get worse.

15:08.998 --> 15:11.833
- Come on. I'll drive you back.
- Fine.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.735
Let me just wolf down
this peanut brittle real quick.

15:13.769 --> 15:15.437
[Peanut brittle clatters]

15:15.471 --> 15:17.939
Why would you do that?

15:17.974 --> 15:19.774
Oh, right.
'Cause calories.

15:19.809 --> 15:21.276
We're dead.

15:21.310 --> 15:23.630
The only tent store this guy
doesn't own is 300 miles away.

15:23.646 --> 15:25.080
Oh, hang on.
Here's a place that might work.

15:25.114 --> 15:28.416
It's called
Sweaty Roger's Pants Tent.

15:28.451 --> 15:30.652
Oh, no, you can't
rent tents there.

15:30.686 --> 15:32.087
[Knocks on door] Hey, guys.

15:32.121 --> 15:34.889
Look, I was double-checking all
the paperwork that Tom gave me

15:34.924 --> 15:36.558
in that super fun parking lot,

15:36.592 --> 15:38.994
and there was something about
Harvey's corporate structure

15:39.028 --> 15:40.261
that just seemed fishy.

15:40.296 --> 15:41.963
So I dug around--
[Chuckles]

15:41.998 --> 15:46.968
and it turns out he has got
a lot of code violations.

15:47.003 --> 15:49.404
Whoa!
Larry, this is great stuff.

15:49.438 --> 15:50.905
Never thought I would say it,

15:50.940 --> 15:52.707
but I'm a genius for making you

15:52.742 --> 15:54.476
stay outside
and do a menial task.

15:54.510 --> 15:57.646
Couldn't agree more.
You did it, Tom.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.081
Mm, I don't want to drive back.

16:00.116 --> 16:01.282
I miss you so much.

16:01.317 --> 16:03.718
No one even comes
close to you as a friend.

16:03.753 --> 16:05.487
I even tried to rank
the women at work,

16:05.521 --> 16:08.323
- but that was a total bust.
- You ranked them?

16:08.357 --> 16:09.724
Well, I thought maybe I could

16:09.759 --> 16:11.326
use Galentine's day
as an opportunity--

16:11.360 --> 16:13.061
- [gasps]
Leslie, Galentine's day?

16:13.095 --> 16:14.663
What do you want me to do, Ann?

16:14.697 --> 16:18.033
I need to find a replacement,
and don't worry, it didn't work.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.735
Nobody can match
your ethnic hybrid energy.

16:20.770 --> 16:24.172
Everybody brings their own
unique strengths to the table.

16:24.207 --> 16:25.507
Some that even I don't have.

16:25.541 --> 16:28.109
You shut your mouth.
You have all the strengths.

16:28.144 --> 16:30.845
Look, you love harder
than anyone I know.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.414
It's tough to match.

16:32.448 --> 16:34.482
And I know Donna and April
don't show it,

16:34.517 --> 16:36.618
but they would
do anything for you.

16:36.652 --> 16:38.787
And it's not like you and I
always see eye to eye.

16:38.821 --> 16:40.789
I mean,<i> Friday Night Lights?</i>

16:40.823 --> 16:43.425
I am more of a Riggins girl,
and you lean Saracen.

16:43.459 --> 16:44.759
Yeah, 'cause Riggins
is a criminal.

16:44.794 --> 16:47.028
He took the fall
for his brother.

16:47.063 --> 16:48.630
Okay, he didn't
watch out for his brother.

16:48.664 --> 16:50.599
You know, I'm not having this
conversation with you again.

16:50.633 --> 16:51.700
That family is garbage.

16:51.734 --> 16:53.768
[Sighs] The point is we didn't

16:53.803 --> 16:57.138
always like the same stuff
when we first became friends.

16:57.173 --> 16:59.808
Just don't force it.
Give it some time.

16:59.842 --> 17:02.344
I know, you're right, Ann.
Thank you.

17:02.378 --> 17:04.012
It's just I'm missing you,

17:04.046 --> 17:06.414
and there's so much stuff
I want to talk to you about.

17:06.449 --> 17:09.050
Well, you're here now,
so let's talk.

17:09.085 --> 17:10.719
[Baby cries]
Oh.

17:10.752 --> 17:13.320
I think Oliver
has more pressing business.

17:13.356 --> 17:14.990
Okay, but we should talk soon,

17:15.023 --> 17:16.191
'cause I almost bought
a toe ring the other day.

17:16.224 --> 17:18.460
What?
Ann, you're somebody's mother.

17:18.493 --> 17:20.462
- I know.
- Okay.

17:20.496 --> 17:22.964
I'm gonna give
you two some time.

17:22.999 --> 17:25.066
I'll call you from the car.

17:25.101 --> 17:27.368
I'll be out here
if you need me.

17:27.403 --> 17:29.804
Thanks for doing this, Ron.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.306
When it's all said and done,

17:31.340 --> 17:32.674
there were a few mazes
I'd cheated on.

17:32.708 --> 17:37.279
Also, the inside of my mouth
is black and hot.

17:38.614 --> 17:42.384
So do I strip down to my
underwear, or all the way naked?

17:45.054 --> 17:46.621
Hello, Diane.

17:46.656 --> 17:51.326
I'm coming home soon to relieve
you, give you a little break.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.161
It's no trouble at all.

17:53.195 --> 17:55.430
I'm a parent.
I'm always on duty.

17:55.464 --> 17:59.100
What flavor ice cream
would you and the children like?

17:59.135 --> 18:01.603
I'm getting some for
a 30-year-old who works for me,

18:01.637 --> 18:04.339
so I can bring some home
for you too.

18:04.373 --> 18:05.607
Hello, Harvey.

18:05.641 --> 18:08.109
We found a glaring number
of code violations

18:08.144 --> 18:10.011
you've committed.

18:10.046 --> 18:12.013
I could see to it
that you never

18:12.048 --> 18:13.949
rent another tent
in this region again.

18:13.983 --> 18:16.818
[Chuckles]
Gentlemen, I've won two

18:16.852 --> 18:19.321
online satellite Jamaican
poker tournaments.

18:19.355 --> 18:20.689
I can tell that you're bluffing.

18:20.723 --> 18:22.524
Your Pawnee business license
has lapsed,

18:22.558 --> 18:24.593
which negates most of the deals
you've made this year.

18:24.627 --> 18:26.795
I'm guessing
you're pretty bad at poker.

18:26.829 --> 18:30.799
I am. And I was bluffing
about winning those tournaments.

18:30.833 --> 18:33.568
Gentlemen, clearly there's been
a misunderstanding here.

18:33.603 --> 18:36.237
I'm hoping that we can reach
some kind of a compromise.

18:36.272 --> 18:38.606
Yeah, first off, I need to know

18:38.641 --> 18:40.141
where you got these
zebra-print pillows.

18:40.176 --> 18:42.510
Second of all,
I got a <i> Tin Cup</i> Blu-Ray

18:42.545 --> 18:43.745
itching for
a Rene Russo signature.

18:43.779 --> 18:45.146
Tom.

18:45.181 --> 18:47.649
The compromise is that
you're gonna sign

18:47.683 --> 18:49.684
the deal we originally
agreed upon.

18:49.719 --> 18:52.254
We're going to let you
continue renting tents,

18:52.288 --> 18:54.122
and you're going to do it
at a fair price.

18:54.156 --> 18:56.691
And Larry, he's the guy
that brought you down,

18:56.726 --> 18:59.628
and he's gonna be
watching you like a hawk.

18:59.662 --> 19:00.962
Oh, hey.

19:00.997 --> 19:03.932
I'm Larry. Great to know you.
I love tent world.

19:03.966 --> 19:06.635
God! Can you just be cool
for one second?

19:07.970 --> 19:11.773
Okay,
black coffee with extra grounds.

19:11.807 --> 19:13.341
Gross. For April.

19:13.376 --> 19:15.610
And a mocha ice blended
for Donna.

19:15.645 --> 19:17.779
Guys, I totally blew it.

19:17.813 --> 19:20.715
I was all screwed up,
and I'm really sorry.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.084
You're wonderful friends,
and I love you.

19:23.119 --> 19:25.086
We love your crazy ass too,
Knope.

19:25.121 --> 19:28.290
I think you're fine.
Like a solid B-minus.

19:28.324 --> 19:29.758
Great. I'll take it.

19:29.792 --> 19:33.295
We know you've been
missing Ann, so we...

19:33.329 --> 19:36.531
got you this.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.633
Press the paw.

19:38.668 --> 19:40.302
[Ann's voice]
Hi, Leslie. It's Ann.

19:40.336 --> 19:42.971
I love you,
and everything's gonna be okay.

19:43.005 --> 19:44.306
It's cute, right?

19:44.340 --> 19:45.941
I'm very lucky
to have you both.

19:45.975 --> 19:48.009
You know, when Ann and I
used to fight,

19:48.044 --> 19:49.978
we would make up
with a five-minute hug.

19:50.012 --> 19:51.492
Mm, you touch me
and I stab the bunny.

19:51.514 --> 19:53.048
Yeah, it's about time
for my mid-morning mani,

19:53.082 --> 19:54.049
so I'm gonna head out.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.717
Okay. Well, that's fine.

19:55.751 --> 19:58.353
Well, you know, we'll forge
our own unique traditions

19:58.387 --> 20:01.890
in the fiery cauldron
of female friendship.

20:01.924 --> 20:03.725
[April's voice]
I'm just an impartial bunny,

20:03.726 --> 20:06.294
but I think Ann sucks.

20:06.329 --> 20:09.197
Also--[Gruff voice]
I'm the zodiac killer.

20:11.770 --> 20:14.882
And we might even be able
to pull it off under budget.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.584
Sorry.
Sorry, you guys, I'm sorry.

20:16.618 --> 20:19.053
I'm trying to find my inhaler,
'cause I'm having a little...

20:19.087 --> 20:20.321
Take your time.
I mean, it's not like

20:20.355 --> 20:21.622
we're trying
to get work done here.

20:21.657 --> 20:22.690
Yeah, and Larry, by the way,

20:22.724 --> 20:23.691
you're looking
in the wrong spot.

20:23.725 --> 20:24.992
Your inhaler is hidden under

20:25.027 --> 20:26.894
the pile of pistachio shells
on my desk, obviously.

20:26.929 --> 20:28.229
Okay, well, that's funny,

20:28.263 --> 20:29.230
'cause I'm terribly allergic
to pistachios.

20:29.264 --> 20:31.132
[Chuckles] Classic.

20:31.166 --> 20:35.570
Okay, you know what?
I need to say something.

20:35.604 --> 20:38.339
I like Larry.

20:38.373 --> 20:41.776
He is a good friend
and a fine man

20:41.810 --> 20:44.178
with an inexplicably
gorgeous wife--

20:44.213 --> 20:46.747
I mean, to the point where
it makes no sense at all.

20:46.782 --> 20:48.249
Sorry. Getting off track.

20:48.283 --> 20:49.851
He is a nice person,

20:49.885 --> 20:55.723
and we should all
stand up and say, "I...

20:55.757 --> 20:56.724
like..."

20:56.758 --> 20:59.427
Ben! No!
What are you doing?

20:59.461 --> 21:01.996
Uh, he's embarrassing himself
and throwing away his career.

21:02.030 --> 21:05.166
- Sweetheart, stop.
- O, captain, my captain.

21:05.200 --> 21:09.203
- What is happening?
- Larry is my friend.

21:09.238 --> 21:11.706
Thank you, Ben.

21:11.740 --> 21:12.707
I mean that.

21:12.741 --> 21:16.577
Oh!
[Farts]

21:16.612 --> 21:19.113
Got so startled I tooted.

21:19.148 --> 21:20.114
Come on, man.

21:20.149 --> 21:21.148
- Oh...
- Gross!
