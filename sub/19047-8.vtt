I just felt like
you got a little bit--

09:50.023 --> 09:52.090
It wasn't.
It was the motion.
It was very weird.

09:52.092 --> 09:56.695
- Why did it move?
- Hey, guys! We got a problem.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.164
We did something.

10:00.333 --> 10:00.999
Oh, man!

10:01.001 --> 10:04.769
- What happened, dude?
- Well, there was a slight
mix-up with the apartments.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.004
This is Korman's neighbor,
Mehar.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.174
- What happened to doing
this without a trace?
- Well, it's a long story.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.409
But the punch line is that
he started asking questions.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.778
- I asked one question!
- Shut up!
- You asked a lot of questions.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.881
Well, let's not have him
ask more questions, okay?
Keep him in the trunk for now.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.985
You can't kidnap
more people to cover up
the original kidnapping.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.486

Oh, I'm sorry!

a handbook on kidnapping!

He's probably
very hot in there.

which is that I locked the keys
in the trunk just now.

Are you kidding me?

to bring that up.

we're gonna do. You guys deal
with the situation out here.

He's writing that new review.

10:38.705 --> 10:42.774
Good. 'Cause I don't want to
see that man right now because
we had a whole thing, and--

10:42.776 --> 10:45.744
- What happened?
- Something happened.
None of your business.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.145
Thank you very much.
We had a thing amongst the--

10:47.147 --> 10:50.915

Let's just go inside.

can hold that inside?

disturbing me at all.

to see you two again.

and-hold-you-here thing.

to do with it.
No. That wasn't us.

to take a swing at you, right?
