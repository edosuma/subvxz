- And I'm gonna make sure
the parole board knows it.
- You gonna bribe 'em?

10:19.285 --> 10:23.278
I might grease the wheels of justice

- Not till you finish your sundae.

10:26.425 --> 10:29.826
Ohh!

Warden, please.
This man is a gentle soul.

I know he's made mistakes,
but someone with his talent...

10:58.224 --> 11:02.422
belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures,
not behind bars.

11:02.528 --> 11:05.759
Lady, I know he charmed you
with some pleases and thank-yous...

11:05.865 --> 11:09.130
but he wasn't so polite
to the guy he shot.

11:09.235 --> 11:13.695
Actually he was. He waited with me
till the ambulance came then ran like a deer.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.774
Well, that's mighty nice.

11:15.875 --> 11:19.902
But if I let this creep out, would you like
him skulking around your neighborhood?

11:20.012 --> 11:23.175
- Honestly, it wouldn't bother me.
- [Whispering, Indistinct]

11:23.282 --> 11:25.773

Uh, Mecca?
Well, let-

- Did you do those exercises he gave you?
- Yeah, right.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.798
- I did 'em while you were studying. [Laughs]
- [Laughs]

12:15.901 --> 12:17.801
- Ow!
- [Cracking]

12:17.903 --> 12:20.531
- Oh! Ow!
- Dad, are you okay?

12:20.639 --> 12:24.439
Yeah.
In fact, I feel fantastic!

12:24.543 --> 12:26.875
[Laughing]

12:26.979 --> 12:29.106
That trash can must've
unkinked your back!

12:29.215 --> 12:33.276
Not trash can, Son-
Dr. Homer's Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder!

12:33.385 --> 12:35.649
- Patent pending.
- Okay, okay.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.213
And as you can see,
the unique dents in my invention...

12:39.325 --> 12:43.022
perfectly match the contours
of the human "vertebrains."

12:43.129 --> 12:46.565
Hmm. Patent pending,
patent pending, patent pending.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.759
- Hey, who's this guy?
- You rememberJack.

12:49.869 --> 12:54.499
He's that talented painter
who had a little brush with the law.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.805
You brought a convict to live
here near my unpatented idea?

12:58.911 --> 13:03.109
I seen your idea, and I don't want it.
All I need is three squares and a job.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.274
That's right, a job.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.020
I know just where you can get one.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.058
So, Homer, you think
you can fix my sciatica?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.357
Hmm. I don't know what that is,
so I'm gonna say yes.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.590
- Now go limp.
- I'm limp.

13:19.698 --> 13:23.794
- One, two, better not sue.
- [Groaning]

13:23.903 --> 13:29.239
Hey, it worked! My searing leg pain
is now a gentle numbness.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.742
- Next!
- Yes, uh, my car seems to have broken down...

13:32.845 --> 13:34.870
and I was wondering
if I could use your-

13:34.980 --> 13:36.948
Oh!
That's a pushing motion!

13:37.049 --> 13:39.017
Simpson, you're not
a licensed chiropractor.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.916
And you're stealing patients
from me and Dr. Steffi.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.989
Boy, talk about irony.

13:44.089 --> 13:47.115
The A.M.A. Tries to drive
you guys out of business.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.854
Now you're doing the same to me!

13:49.962 --> 13:52.294
- Think about the irony.
- [Grunts]

13:52.398 --> 13:55.162
- [Groans]
- You've been warned. Stop chiropracting!

13:55.267 --> 13:58.202
Not unless you think
about the irony!

13:59.605 --> 14:01.436
I read in
the <i>Daily Fourth Gradian...</i>

14:01.540 --> 14:03.371
that you need someone
to paint a mural.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.943
Yes. School spirit
is down 3.4 percent.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.776
- Well, Jack here will do great work for you.
- Oh, any references?

14:09.882 --> 14:13.545
Well, to be honest with you,
I spent the last six years in Waterville State-

14:13.652 --> 14:16.052
It's a small liberal arts college.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.851
Very law-abiding.
No convicts at all.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.051
Well, the only other one
to apply was Moe Szyslak...

14:21.160 --> 14:23.219
and his stuff scares
the hell out of me.

14:23.329 --> 14:26.924
Ew! How could anyone
consider <i>that</i> making love?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.966
All right, Jack.
You're hired.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.593
I'll clear you out a cubby.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.332
- You told a lie for me.
- I know.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.967
But the Lord will forgive me
if it helps you get a second chance.

14:38.077 --> 14:41.535
Actually, Marge, it's the third
if you count that farm couple.

14:41.647 --> 14:45.083
- Farm couple?
- But I got a good feelin' about this one, Marge.
I really do.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.015
[Groans]

14:50.589 --> 14:54.821
That is awesome.
Finally, art that doesn't suck.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.861
Dear Lord!
What are you doing?

14:56.962 --> 15:00.227
- You don't like it?
- No, no! It's all wrong.

15:00.332 --> 15:04.234
- A shapely female form has no place in art.
- But what I thought is-

15:04.336 --> 15:08.136
- I sketched out exactly what I wanted.
- But what I was goin' for-

15:08.240 --> 15:11.004
Did you even look at the napkin?

15:11.110 --> 15:13.908
Oh, I was in the zone that day.

15:14.013 --> 15:17.346
Yeah. You see, I didn't want
to go so cutesy-wootsy.

15:17.449 --> 15:21.044
- Because-
- Because it's not my style.

15:21.153 --> 15:24.680
Well, if you want to keep this job,
you'll make it your style.

15:24.790 --> 15:27.657
All right.
You're the boss man, ain't ya?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.728
Darn right I'm the boss.

15:29.828 --> 15:33.025
Don't forget I can send you back
where you came from, college boy.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.032
[Groans]

15:39.271 --> 15:41.171
[Grunting]

15:42.541 --> 15:45.601
That punk Skinner.
I had more freedom back at the joint.

15:45.711 --> 15:51.206
Oh, Jack, I know you hate to betray
your artistic vision, but just do it.

15:51.317 --> 15:54.548
- I guess I could bend a little.
- Just till you make it.

15:54.653 --> 15:58.248
Remember, I believe in you.

15:58.357 --> 16:01.588
[Grunting]
Thanks, Marge.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.686
Listen, if you're done with that washing machine,
can I make some booze in it?

16:04.797 --> 16:08.289
- Not until you finish your sundae.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:09.601 --> 16:13.401
- [Groaning]
- What's wrong with my sundaes?

16:13.505 --> 16:16.440
Careful, I'm frail.
[Grunting]

16:18.444 --> 16:21.504
- Okay, that should do it, Moe.
- Hey, it don't hurt no more.

16:21.613 --> 16:25.242
Huh! Now I can focus on
my crippling <i>emotional</i> pain.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.218
Oh, Daddy, Daddy, why?
Why won't you hug me?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.288
You hugged the mailman!

16:30.389 --> 16:35.486
- Excuse me, sir. Is this <i>El Clínico Magnifico?</i>
- Ah, you saw our bus ad.

16:35.594 --> 16:39.291
We'd, uh, like to invest in
your spinal adjustment device.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.367
We might be able to do business.
[Giggles]

16:42.468 --> 16:44.800
We'll need to take some photographs.

16:44.903 --> 16:46.768
Hey, where you going with that?

16:46.872 --> 16:50.433
[Grunting]

16:50.542 --> 16:53.409
Wait a minute.
No investor could bend like that!

16:53.512 --> 16:55.412
They're chiropractors!

16:55.514 --> 16:58.711
- [Both Grunting]
- Come on, come on. Let's go!

17:00.986 --> 17:04.786
No!
My Spine-O-Cylinder!

17:04.890 --> 17:08.553
They'll pay for what
they did to my can!

17:08.660 --> 17:11.220
Forget it, Homer.
It's Chiro-town.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.127
<i>You know, when Superintendent Chalmers</i>
<i>suggested a school mural...</i>

17:18.237 --> 17:22.230
I almost thought he said a school <i>Muriel.</i>
[Laughs]

17:22.340 --> 17:24.309
Muriel's his sister.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.674
- <i>And, uh-</i>
- <i>[Gun Cocking]</i>

17:28.781 --> 17:32.774
- Oh, thank you, Bruce Vilanch.
- Whoopi would've made it work.

17:32.885 --> 17:37.845
And now I present <i>Puma Pride</i>
by a college-educated artist-

17:37.956 --> 17:41.687
- [All] Ooh!
- Jack Crowley.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.228
[Applauding]

17:44.329 --> 17:47.890
- Man, is that wimpy.
- [Groans] What happened to the cool one?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.333
- Well, my original idea was-
- Jeepers, that's sugary even for my taste.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.564
- Yeah, but Skinner said I had-
- [Crowd Murmuring]

17:53.672 --> 17:59.235
Skinner! How are we going to raise
school spirit with this sappy hokum?

17:59.344 --> 18:01.938
I know, sir.
It's an embarrassment.

18:02.047 --> 18:05.141
This isn't what I wanted.
Where's the edge?

18:05.250 --> 18:07.582
I followed your napkin.

18:07.686 --> 18:11.122
No napkin could wipe
the crumbs of failure from your mouth!

18:11.223 --> 18:13.453
- No! No, don't fight.
- [Grunts]

18:13.559 --> 18:16.722
All great art
is controversial at first.

18:16.829 --> 18:21.664
But years from now, people will point
to these cuddly little creatures and say...

18:21.767 --> 18:25.168
"That's a Jack Crowley."

18:25.270 --> 18:29.866
Now, uh, pizza's working well
on Thursday.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.375
But I think the kids
will follow it to Tuesday.

18:32.478 --> 18:37.040
That's what you said about the stuffed peppers,
and you lost the young males!

18:37.149 --> 18:40.744
- Principal Skinner, the school's on fire!
- [Gasps]

18:40.853 --> 18:43.413
[Children]
Spread, spread, spread!

18:43.522 --> 18:46.787
- Spread, spread, spread!
- It's crystal clear who did this-Jack Crowley!

18:46.892 --> 18:49.986
No way. You don't know
thatJack did this.

18:50.095 --> 18:53.929
- Just because he's an ex-con- Ooh!
- Crowley's an ex-con?

18:54.032 --> 18:56.398
Dear Lord, I've peed
in front of him!

18:56.502 --> 18:59.528
Hey, check it out!

18:59.638 --> 19:03.165
- [Children Exclaiming]
- Ha! Now that's a mural!

19:03.275 --> 19:06.642
It's so passionate.
It almost leaps off the wall.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.513
- Ooh.
- That felon could've torched the whole school-

19:12.618 --> 19:14.586
were it not stuffed with asbestos.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.654
We'll catch Crowley.

19:16.755 --> 19:21.351
And then he'll learn the fine art
of police brutality.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.994
Psst!
Marge, over here.

19:28.867 --> 19:34.396
Oh, Jack. You threw it all away
over a stupid feud with Skinner.

19:34.506 --> 19:38.772
Look, I'll admit I hate Skinner.
But I didn't start that fire.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.471
- Then why are you hiding?
- Come on, Marge.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.413
With my rap sheet, they can't wait
to send me back to prison.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.677
And you can't believe
the foul language in that place.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.185
So you really didn't do it?

19:49.288 --> 19:52.382
Marge, look in my eyes.

19:52.491 --> 19:55.119
I swear to you I did not do it.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.659
I believe you, Jack.

19:58.764 --> 20:02.632
Now, let's get you out of here.
Wait for my signal.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.759
<i>Oh, Chief?</i>

20:04.870 --> 20:08.670
I found some evidence that points
to the real arsonist.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.767
- Well, let's see it.
- Not yet. You have to guess what it is.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.108
We don't have time
for guessing games!

20:15.214 --> 20:17.341
Nah, let's try it.
It might be fun.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.383
- Is it D.N. A?
- [Groans Coyly]

20:19.484 --> 20:22.317
So it's like D.N.A.
Um, a hatchet?

20:22.421 --> 20:24.389
You had a turn.
I want to guess.

20:24.489 --> 20:28.357
- [Clicks Tongue] Oh, geez.
- [Gasps] My car!

20:28.460 --> 20:30.928
[Cackling]

20:32.631 --> 20:35.259
Puma Pride! Puma Pride!

20:35.367 --> 20:37.267
[Cackling]

20:37.369 --> 20:40.827
Catch the fever, Skinner!
[Cackling]

20:44.910 --> 20:47.538
You crumb bum!

20:47.646 --> 20:50.342
You looked me right in the eye
and lied to me!

20:50.449 --> 20:53.748
Marge, this is the God's truth.
I burned the mural.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.843
But I did not burn Skinner's car.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.047
I just saw you!

20:58.156 --> 21:01.956
- Get him outta here, Chief!
- Yes, ma'am.

21:02.060 --> 21:06.087
My wife and I like watching
that <i>Oz</i> show on HBO.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.359
Uh, i-is prison really like that?

21:08.467 --> 21:11.800
- Wouldn't know. We only get basic cable.
- Ouch.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.337
Yeah, I also like that <i>Sex in the City.</i>
Huh!

21:14.439 --> 21:18.102
None of those girls look like my wife.
[Laughing]

21:18.210 --> 21:21.270
- <i>Sports Center's</i> not bad.
- Yeah. I never got that show.

21:21.380 --> 21:25.111
- What's to get? They just tell the scores.
- Yeah, I suppose.

21:25.217 --> 21:29.085
Hey, you ever meet any mob guys?
Are they really like <i>The Sopranos?</i>

21:29.187 --> 21:33.123
- I told you. We just get basic cable.
- Oh, right, right, right, right.

21:33.225 --> 21:36.353
<i>[Wiggum] Listen, if I'm getting too chatty,</i>
<i>just, uh-just tell me to shut up.</i>

21:36.461 --> 21:39.031
<i>[Crowley] Nah, I'm enjoyin'it.</i>
<i>Hey, you ever watch them strong-man contests?</i>

21:39.031 --> 21:39.656
<i>[Crowley] Nah, I'm enjoyin'it.</i>
<i>Hey, you ever watch them strong-man contests?</i>

21:39.765 --> 21:41.733
<i>They're pretty good.</i>
<i>Those guys look strong.</i>

21:41.833 --> 21:45.769
<i>A lot of guys in prison say they're gay,</i>
<i>but I don't know. They look strong to me.</i>

22:24.576 --> 22:26.544
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
