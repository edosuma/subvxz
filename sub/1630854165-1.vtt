PAIN ELIMINATING PLASTER

02:01.625 --> 02:03.833
MR. LIU

02:03.916 --> 02:05.125
Grandma.

02:07.875 --> 02:08.833
Grandma.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.416
Grandma!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.083
Grandma.

02:14.958 --> 02:16.166
Grandma.

02:20.916 --> 02:22.333
Grandma.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.333
Xixi, what's the matter with you?

02:29.416 --> 02:30.875
Do you play me for a fool?

02:31.541 --> 02:32.833
I called you and texted you

02:32.916 --> 02:34.083
on WeChat every single day,

02:34.166 --> 02:36.333
you don't answer my calls
or reply to my texts.

02:36.416 --> 02:37.916
What are you doing?

02:44.583 --> 02:45.500
Xixi.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.208
I'm sorry.
I was a bit agitated in my speech.

02:49.958 --> 02:51.625
It's just that I missed you so much.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.125
JIANREN

02:54.333 --> 02:55.208
What is it?

02:55.291 --> 02:56.416
<i>This isn't working.</i>

02:56.500 --> 02:57.625
<i>You should do it.</i>

02:57.708 --> 02:58.708
<i>Her body has gotten stiff.</i>

02:58.791 --> 02:59.875
JIANREN

03:24.458 --> 03:25.333
San,

03:25.416 --> 03:26.875
quite a haircut you got there.

03:26.958 --> 03:28.750
My head looks like your dad's.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.250
What are you talking about?

03:30.333 --> 03:31.458
I am your dad!

03:39.083 --> 03:40.041
Hot water.

03:40.541 --> 03:41.458
Towel.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.916
Don't touch my grandma!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.583
-Don't touch my grandma!
-What are you doing?

04:41.666 --> 04:42.583
Don't touch her!

04:43.333 --> 04:44.375
Don't touch my grandma!

04:44.458 --> 04:45.625
Let me down!

04:45.708 --> 04:47.041
Don't touch my grandma!

04:47.625 --> 04:50.041
-Don't touch my grandma! Let me down!
-The topic of my speech is

04:50.125 --> 04:51.625
-"I Love My Home".
-Look after your sister, Xiaowu.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.250
Let me out of here!

04:55.333 --> 04:58.375
Feet widened, shoes donned,
on the main road you go,

04:58.458 --> 05:00.916
may you cross
the Bridge of Forgetfulness safely.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.666
-It's 10 a.m. in Chunhui Hall,
-Go to heaven

05:02.750 --> 05:04.291
-and return to your rightful place.
-Qingtian Funeral Parlor.

05:04.958 --> 05:05.958
-Mr. Liu is coming.
-Bless your children

05:06.041 --> 05:07.708
-Get there early to find a parking spot.
-with riches.

05:07.791 --> 05:10.750
Seriously. Your mom just has
to pick this time to go.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.541
As if we weren't busy enough already.

05:12.625 --> 05:14.666
Can't we postpone
the mourning until tomorrow?

05:14.750 --> 05:16.333
I want to keep her here for an extra day.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.541
I don't think we can cancel
today's tickets to Beijing.

05:18.625 --> 05:21.000
-I'm not going.
-Since when do you have a say in this?

05:21.083 --> 05:22.291
I'm warning you.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.750
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance
for our son.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.083
Even if you spend
a few more days with her,

05:31.166 --> 05:32.583
she's gone anyway.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.041
How about this?

05:34.125 --> 05:36.250
Let's just be with her
a little while longer, okay?

05:39.041 --> 05:39.958
Stop there!

05:41.333 --> 05:44.583
Where's the ancestral gold ring
on your mom's finger?

05:45.708 --> 05:46.916
What are you implying?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.500
Do you dare steal from the dead?

05:48.583 --> 05:49.708
Are you not afraid of karma?

05:49.791 --> 05:51.791
-What are you talking about?
-Stealing?

05:51.875 --> 05:53.500
-I didn't steal it.
-Stop talking nonsense.

05:53.583 --> 05:55.125
We didn't steal anything.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.250
Then how will you prove
that you're innocent?

05:57.791 --> 06:00.125
See? We didn't steal it.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.291
The ring is tiny.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.041
You could've hidden it anywhere.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.125
Search me then.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.291
Search me.

06:21.916 --> 06:22.916
Search.

06:23.000 --> 06:23.916
Pervert!

06:25.083 --> 06:26.166
Don't run away!

06:27.791 --> 06:30.458
Don't make false accusations
unless you catch him red-handed.

06:30.541 --> 06:32.750
This is San. He just got out of prison.

06:32.833 --> 06:35.000
I see that your mouths are running loose.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.166
Why don't I tighten them up for you?

06:36.250 --> 06:37.416
San.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.416
The van from the crematorium is here.
Shall we go?

06:39.500 --> 06:40.625
I'm done with this job.

06:40.708 --> 06:41.958
We're not even paid yet.

06:46.291 --> 06:47.291
<i>Mom.</i>

06:47.375 --> 06:49.708
Have a safe journey to the next world!

06:50.541 --> 06:51.416
Rise.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.666
Your grandma
is in that big box over there.

06:58.958 --> 07:00.791
Mom.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.041
She's being taken to the crematorium

07:05.125 --> 07:06.291
where she'll be burnt to ash

07:06.375 --> 07:07.666
and buried in a grave.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.541
Rubbish! I'll tear
that blabbering mouth off your face!

07:10.625 --> 07:12.791
She's dead and you'll never see her again.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.416
Don't you dare say that!

07:21.708 --> 07:23.125
Drive slowly.

07:35.666 --> 07:38.458
UP SKY

08:05.875 --> 08:07.625
San, another one gone.

08:07.708 --> 08:09.541
Sooner or later,
I will make you gone as well.

08:09.625 --> 08:10.625
Take this.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.500
Good stuff. A whole pack next time.

08:13.583 --> 08:16.333
Can't you park your van somewhere else?
Build some good karma.

08:17.041 --> 08:20.125
My van, my own doorstep.
It's none of your business.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.416
You're in the funeral business.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.208
With your van in front of my wedding shop,

08:23.291 --> 08:24.666
how will we attract customers?

08:25.416 --> 08:26.500
Xiaopang, come here.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.083
This is for dead people.
Go wash your hands.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.333
Yes, listen to your mom
and remember to use boiling water.

08:31.416 --> 08:33.416
Otherwise, your hands will rot.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.416
You should wash that mouth of yours.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.625
Just park your van further away.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.416
And why should I do that?

08:43.916 --> 08:45.375
Who do you think you are?

08:49.291 --> 08:50.166
<i>Have a peach.</i>

08:50.250 --> 08:51.583
Sir, have a peach.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.958
You make the days go by
like tasteless porridge.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.208
Somehow, you've managed a whole year.

08:56.291 --> 08:57.708
I shall keep my promise.

08:57.791 --> 08:58.833
The store

08:58.916 --> 08:59.833
is yours.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.083
Our business…

09:07.166 --> 09:10.250
The capable one looks down on it,
the weak one can't stand it.

09:10.333 --> 09:14.250
The three books of work notes
are written by your grandpa, me,

09:14.333 --> 09:16.958
and your older brother.

09:17.041 --> 09:18.916
Learn from them and carry on our legacy.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.583
Make notes with each deceased we send off.

09:21.666 --> 09:23.666
I will inspect the books regularly.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.666
Sure, Dad.

09:24.750 --> 09:25.750
I got it.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.166
Now kneel and pay respects
to your granddad and your brother.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.208
My big sister,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.666
this isn't necessary, right?

09:33.750 --> 09:35.083
Just do it. Kneel.

09:35.166 --> 09:36.000
Hurry up.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.375
Grandpa, here's your grandson's kowtow.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.833
Why don't we skip the one for my brother?

09:47.916 --> 09:49.500
I've never even known him.

09:49.583 --> 09:50.791
Put that down.

09:51.875 --> 09:52.833
I'll do it in his name.

09:52.916 --> 09:54.958
Here's one for his grandpa.

09:55.041 --> 09:56.708
Here's another one for his older brother.

09:57.291 --> 09:58.416
Done.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.708
Take your ID card
and go change this property's ownership.

10:03.291 --> 10:04.916
I can wait.
Let's do the transfer tomorrow.

10:07.583 --> 10:08.458
Where is this?

10:08.541 --> 10:09.708
I have a picture.

10:09.791 --> 10:10.833
Follow this road.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.500
It's over there.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.916
Remember now? That way.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Thank you, ma'am.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.125
Open the door.

10:29.708 --> 10:30.625
Open the door.

10:31.625 --> 10:32.583
Open up.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.416
I can hear your ringtone.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.375
Open up!

10:48.166 --> 10:49.333
What are you doing here?

10:49.416 --> 10:50.291
Why are you closed?

10:50.375 --> 10:52.125
Didn't I text you?

10:52.208 --> 10:53.041
We're broken up.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.583
Believe me or not.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.875
I'd smash my way in
if you don't open the door right now.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.833
I got the ownership of my dad's house.

11:04.916 --> 11:06.083
You get out!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.625
What's your stupid house
have to do with me?

11:08.708 --> 11:11.708
Didn't you always want to join
a big maternal and child goods brand?

11:11.791 --> 11:12.916
I can help you with that.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.875
Don't you know?
I've waited for over two months.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.250
-I can't wait any longer.
-Get out.

11:18.750 --> 11:19.791
It's your turn to shower.

11:23.041 --> 11:23.916
Laoliu,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.375
Sanmei, you're here.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.166
We just changed the bedsheet

11:28.250 --> 11:29.458
and you've messed it all up.

11:29.541 --> 11:30.500
You!

11:30.583 --> 11:31.500
I…

11:33.500 --> 11:34.416
Laoliu, let go!

11:34.500 --> 11:35.833
Dear wife,

11:35.916 --> 11:37.208
he was the first to get physical.

11:38.125 --> 11:38.958
Release me.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.000
Let him go.

11:46.541 --> 11:47.833
I'm pregnant!

11:53.875 --> 11:54.875
I'm pregnant!

11:55.625 --> 11:56.500
The baby is his.

12:00.958 --> 12:03.583
I fought him over you.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.500
That's how I went to jail.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.041
I just want to get married, have a child,
a home, and someone to rely on.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.291
-What's wrong with that?
-What makes you think I can't

12:11.375 --> 12:12.625
-give you a home?
-With what?

12:16.458 --> 12:18.291
I just don't see you being mature.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.583
I don't see you being a good dad.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.833
Sanmei,

12:23.916 --> 12:24.833
you should take

12:25.500 --> 12:26.416
this money.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.375
See it as our way of making it up to you.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.083
It was you.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.916
You're the last person
who touched my grandma.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.750
Where did you take my grandma?

12:47.458 --> 12:48.750
What's wrong with you?

12:48.833 --> 12:50.500
Where did you take my grandma?

12:50.583 --> 12:51.458
-Enough.
-Where is she?

12:51.541 --> 12:53.916
-To the crematorium! Where else?
-Where is my grandma?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
What kind of childhood did you have?

12:55.583 --> 12:57.250
The crematorium was my childhood.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.458
-You give me my grandma back!
-It's okay.

12:58.541 --> 13:00.625
I'm really not in the mood for this.
Take her away now.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.875
-Give me my grandma back!
-I have informed her parents.

13:02.958 --> 13:04.291
-They'll be here soon.
-Let me go.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.833
I'll play a cartoon for you, okay?

13:05.916 --> 13:07.375
How about an ice cream?

13:07.458 --> 13:09.583
We are so sorry to have bothered you.

13:09.666 --> 13:12.250
Some parents you are.
You let your child loose like this.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.375
-Yes. Xiaowen, let's go.
-I'm not going.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.458
-Come with me.
-I'm not going.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.083
-I'm not.
-What are you doing?

13:17.166 --> 13:19.750
-Xiaowen.
-I'm not going.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.166
Now. Go home.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.125
I'm not!

13:22.208 --> 13:23.458
That's too much.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.750
Come on, Xiaowen.

13:24.833 --> 13:25.958
-Xiaowen.
-I'm not going home!

13:26.791 --> 13:27.791
-Xiaowen!
-I'm not!

13:27.875 --> 13:29.666
-Go home!
-I'm not!

13:29.750 --> 13:30.916
-Come on. Let's go.
-I'm not!

13:31.000 --> 13:32.791
Your grandma is in the room.
Go and look for her.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.166
Grandma?

13:34.875 --> 13:35.958
Your grandma is not here.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.208
Let me go!

13:37.291 --> 13:38.500
Let me go!

13:39.833 --> 13:40.708
Stop biting me.

13:40.791 --> 13:41.791
-Stop!
-I'll hit you!

13:41.875 --> 13:43.708
-Stop!
-Stop!

13:44.291 --> 13:46.041
-Let's go.
-Put me down.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.875
Such a biter. You're a dog, aren't you?

13:47.958 --> 13:49.833
You jerk! I want my grandma back.

13:50.583 --> 13:51.875
Let me go.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.750
I'm telling you. Let me go.

13:56.458 --> 13:57.875
I see that you own the property now.

13:57.958 --> 13:59.333
Why don't you transfer
the ownership to me?

13:59.416 --> 14:01.208
We'll join our strengths
in the wedding business.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.666
You'll still be the boss

14:02.750 --> 14:04.041
and I'll give you 15%.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.458
Stop annoying me, will you?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.125
Your family needs to change your ways.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.625
Always dealing with the dead

14:09.708 --> 14:10.625
is bad for feng shui.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.375
Look. Your dad lost a son
in his middle age.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.541
Your sister is married
but spent half her life alone.

14:14.625 --> 14:15.666
Then look at you.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.666
You're in your thirties now.

14:17.750 --> 14:20.791
You struggled so much to get a girlfriend
and probably won't even marry her.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.458
What the heck is wrong with you?

14:22.541 --> 14:23.708
Get off.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.375
-It's only a business proposal.
-Get off.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.375
San, it's better to send people
to wedding beds than heaven.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.875
-Be assured. We'll be back again.
-I'll be waiting.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.583
Fine. Take care.

14:31.666 --> 14:33.833
-Thank you. Bye.
-I'll reserve the wedding gown for you.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.375
-Take care.
-Xiaopang, let's go eat a watermelon.

14:37.458 --> 14:41.000
DAPANG WEDDING SHOP

14:41.958 --> 14:43.708
<i>Rain shall pour from the sky,
widows shall get remarried,</i>

14:44.291 --> 14:46.125
and you should think about
changing professions.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.041
I'm sick of spending my days like this.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.958
I'm going to change the way I live.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.291
San, I know your mind
is worried about something.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.208
Why don't you tell us

14:53.291 --> 14:54.500
and we'll see how we can help?

14:55.500 --> 14:56.750
What could be bothering my mind?

14:56.833 --> 14:59.416
How about being accused of stealing?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.125
Getting cheated on by your ex?

15:01.208 --> 15:03.000
And the guy she dumped you for

15:03.083 --> 15:05.041
being richer than you?

15:05.125 --> 15:07.208
Or others saying
that you make a living off the dead?

15:07.291 --> 15:08.791
Or you're inferiority complex

15:08.875 --> 15:10.583
because you've been to prison?

15:11.250 --> 15:13.125
Are you trying to cheer me up
or piss me off?

15:13.208 --> 15:14.875
I'm taking down the shop sign now.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.166
In short, you have an attitude problem.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.000
No one's history is spotlessly clean.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.500
I was a thief

15:23.000 --> 15:24.458
and she was an illegal street trader.

15:24.541 --> 15:26.208
If you're sickened,
we should just give up our lives.

15:26.291 --> 15:27.541
Then I'll kill myself, are you happy?

15:27.625 --> 15:29.416
Will killing yourself solve your problems?

15:29.500 --> 15:30.958
The reason you find life so hard

15:31.041 --> 15:33.375
is because you constantly
look down on yourself.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.750
-Why are you arguing with me?
-You look down on yourself.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.000
How can others look up to you?

15:37.916 --> 15:39.083
Get up.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.041
Get the hell up.

15:41.583 --> 15:42.750
Get the hell up now.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.416
Give me my grandma back.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.958
-Let me go!
-Get out now!

15:56.041 --> 15:57.416
-Get out!
-Let me go!

15:57.500 --> 15:59.208
Are you leaving or not? Just go!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.250
I don't have time for this.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.041
She bit me.

16:07.708 --> 16:08.541
Xiaowen,

16:09.166 --> 16:11.833
I will take you to Beijing
to have some fun, okay?

16:11.916 --> 16:13.583
I'm not going anywhere.

16:13.666 --> 16:14.916
I want to find my grandma.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.125
Your grandma is…

16:21.041 --> 16:22.541
What on earth is taking you so long?

16:22.625 --> 16:24.291
We'll miss our flight.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.666
I know,

16:25.750 --> 16:27.250
but what can I do if she won't leave?

16:27.333 --> 16:30.208
Listen. If our son misses anything,
you won't hear the end of it.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.666
-Hurry!
-Stop shouting at me. I'll find a way.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.375
Sir, could you please open the trunk?

16:39.208 --> 16:41.125
Sir, do you think this will work?

16:41.708 --> 16:43.958
Can you look after this kid
for three days?

16:44.041 --> 16:45.250
Absolutely not.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.541
This is for the trouble.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.125
Maybe there is a way.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.083
I said no. No way.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.208
This is a graveclothes store,
not an orphanage.

16:53.291 --> 16:56.041
You have no childhood
and there's no empathy in you either.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.250
Are you coming or not?

16:58.333 --> 16:59.583
I'm coming.

16:59.666 --> 17:02.083
-Can't you see? They're in such a hurry.
-Please.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.083
-Xiaowen, be good.
-Hurry up!

17:04.166 --> 17:05.750
-No problem.
-Hurry up.

17:06.666 --> 17:07.541
Take care.

17:10.041 --> 17:11.416
What's the matter with you?

17:14.083 --> 17:15.541
Do you have a problem with money?

17:16.791 --> 17:18.458
Come out now. You can stay here.

17:18.541 --> 17:19.541
Come.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.416
Are you sure
you can handle this little devil?

17:25.000 --> 17:25.875
Come on out.

17:25.958 --> 17:27.833
Have a hot shower,
so you don't catch a cold.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.375
It's just three days with a kid.
How hard can it be?

17:36.750 --> 17:38.416
Give me my grandma back.

17:43.708 --> 17:44.625
Eat.

17:51.916 --> 17:53.125
No garlic?

17:53.208 --> 17:54.125
What?

17:54.208 --> 17:56.958
Grandma used to say
a noodle without garlic

17:57.041 --> 17:58.833
tastes only half as good.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.291
Have you not been eating
in the last few days?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.083
Don't your parents look after you?

18:13.583 --> 18:14.750
I have no mom and dad.

18:16.041 --> 18:17.833
How did you get here anyway?

18:19.208 --> 18:20.333
I took a picture,

18:20.416 --> 18:22.208
showed it to people,

18:22.291 --> 18:24.291
and they showed me the way.

18:24.375 --> 18:25.666
Grandma used to say

18:25.750 --> 18:27.625
the road is right under the nose.

18:29.916 --> 18:31.291
Let's play a game.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.833
-Hide and seek.
-I'm not interested.

18:32.916 --> 18:34.708
Then what kind of game
did you play with your grandma?

18:34.791 --> 18:36.041
Mahjong.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.208
Come on.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.333
How big are the bets?

18:48.541 --> 18:50.416
You stole your grandma's ring.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.583
I didn't steal it.

18:52.666 --> 18:53.625
She gave it to me.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.708
You mustn't let my uncle know.

18:59.375 --> 19:00.250
Put that away.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.208
A child shouldn't gamble with money.

19:03.916 --> 19:05.583
TO BRING IN WEALTH AND TREASURE

19:11.083 --> 19:12.125
Four bamboos.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.083
Pong.

19:14.541 --> 19:15.458
East wind.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.875
Are we going to keep playing
this one game until daybreak?

19:25.958 --> 19:26.958
I win.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.291
Same color, three sequences.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.375
Five cracks makes the winning tile.

19:33.000 --> 19:33.833
Another game.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.208
My grandma said

19:35.291 --> 19:37.875
quit while you're ahead.

19:40.583 --> 19:41.500
It's bedtime.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.583
Is yours human or goat piss?

20:15.666 --> 20:16.625
It's such a horrible stink.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.416
If you want to wee, go to the toilet,

20:18.500 --> 20:19.375
bathroom,

20:19.458 --> 20:20.500
or restroom.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.750
Your grandma taught you so many things.
Don't you know something so basic?

20:23.333 --> 20:26.166
Why are you shouting at a child
in the middle of the night?

20:26.791 --> 20:28.458
I haven't wet the bed in a long time.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.833
It's just that I'm afraid
to go to your bathroom.

20:30.916 --> 20:32.541
What's so scary about my bathroom?

20:41.541 --> 20:42.875
It's fine.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.000
These are all made of paper.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.750
Like that ugly tiger of yours.

20:46.833 --> 20:47.750
They are all fake.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.250
She has a name, Beans.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.791
My grandma made it.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.208
They have names too.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.708
The boy is called Cucumber.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.208
The girl is called Aubergine.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.208
They are the same. Don't be scared.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.375
Let's go back to bed.

21:02.458 --> 21:03.375
I'm tired.

21:04.291 --> 21:06.125
Let's sleep now.

21:11.958 --> 21:13.291
Where am I supposed to sleep then?

21:35.791 --> 21:36.666
Hello.

21:36.750 --> 21:37.583
<i>Sanmei,</i>

21:37.666 --> 21:39.875
<i>Dad and I are waiting
in the hall for the transfer.</i>

21:39.958 --> 21:41.666
<i>Take the ownership certificate and come.</i>

22:02.500 --> 22:05.458
All the important information
is being washed off.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.333
I'm afraid we can't proceed
with the transfer.

22:07.416 --> 22:09.166
How many days will it take
to get a new one?

22:09.250 --> 22:11.416
First, you need to make
a statement explaining the loss

22:11.500 --> 22:13.083
and it takes at least a month.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.041
There's no need to be
so dogmatic about this.

22:17.708 --> 22:19.625
A dad is giving a house to his son.
Does it need to be this hard?

22:19.708 --> 22:21.541
Why can't you wait a month then?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.375
Are you planning on something?

22:24.875 --> 22:25.750
Relax.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.541
What could I possibly be planning?

22:27.625 --> 22:29.458
Hello. What are you doing at the hospital?

22:30.041 --> 22:31.458
I've been very clear about this.

22:32.041 --> 22:33.875
I'm closing the business. I'm done.

22:33.958 --> 22:35.750
Stop going against
everything I want, will you?

22:35.833 --> 22:37.416
I think it's you who's going against

22:37.500 --> 22:38.833
-me all the time.
-What are you doing?

22:38.916 --> 22:40.791
What are you doing? It hurts.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.500
The house is for you to do business.

22:42.583 --> 22:45.208
Don't you dare close up the shop
without my say-so.

22:47.291 --> 22:48.166
Sanmei.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.500
I'm watching you.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.375
Where is my grandma?

23:11.416 --> 23:12.708
You promised me.

23:12.791 --> 23:15.541
When I wake up,
you'd take me to find my grandma.

23:15.625 --> 23:16.750
Liar.

23:22.625 --> 23:23.708
We are the…

23:23.791 --> 23:25.291
I was here first.

23:25.875 --> 23:26.916
My condolences.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.833
You people have been waiting outside
even when my girl is still alive.

23:32.916 --> 23:34.375
The doctor just pronounced her dead

23:34.458 --> 23:36.291
and you're onto me
like crazed, starving dogs.

23:36.375 --> 23:37.958
Do you not have kids of your own?

23:38.041 --> 23:39.416
Build some good karma.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.250
Is it a little girl?

23:47.375 --> 23:48.791
She has been sick for over a year.

23:48.875 --> 23:50.625
She's probably died of heart failure.

23:54.041 --> 23:54.916
Hello.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.791
<i>Listen. The old man
is really fed up this time.</i>

23:56.875 --> 23:58.875
<i>Behave yourself
if you still want the house.</i>

23:58.958 --> 24:01.000
I didn't do it on purpose.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.458
Where is my grandma?

24:05.375 --> 24:07.333
Stop bothering me, will you?

24:15.458 --> 24:16.958
I'll take you to find your grandma

24:17.041 --> 24:18.500
if you listen to what I say.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.333
Do you hear me?

24:44.041 --> 24:45.875
You guys really don't know
when to quit, do you?

24:47.875 --> 24:48.750
Sir.

24:49.958 --> 24:51.916
May I borrow
a minute of your time, please?

24:55.916 --> 24:57.125
I just saw you

24:57.208 --> 24:59.791
over there in the hallway
telling them off.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.583
I want to tell you that I understand.
I really do.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.000
However, there has to be someone

25:07.083 --> 25:09.000
to help you
with the child's funeral arrangements.

25:10.541 --> 25:11.625
At a time like this,

25:12.208 --> 25:13.750
everyone in the family must stay strong.

25:17.458 --> 25:18.541
This is my daughter.

25:19.541 --> 25:21.291
My wife is never happy
with the fact that I'm poor,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.250
so she ran off with a man
who owns a maternal goods store.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.958
So I have to bring my daughter along
when working.

25:27.041 --> 25:29.166
If you think I'm trustworthy,

25:29.250 --> 25:31.375
please allow me to make the arrangements.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.333
I'm not doing this for profit.

25:33.416 --> 25:35.625
It's like what you said.
Good karma for my daughter.

25:47.416 --> 25:50.166
It will be cremated
early tomorrow morning, so it's urgent.

25:51.666 --> 25:53.166
I'm leaving the paperwork to you.

25:54.333 --> 25:55.666
Wait.

25:55.750 --> 25:56.583
What are you doing?

25:56.666 --> 25:59.000
I'm taking a photo of this contract
and sending it to my dad

25:59.083 --> 26:00.750
to cheer him up a little.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.000
QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR

26:13.916 --> 26:15.333
QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR

26:16.166 --> 26:17.250
Go.

26:27.041 --> 26:28.708
Shut up and don't move.

26:28.791 --> 26:29.666
Remember.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.958
FUNERAL

26:50.541 --> 26:52.041
FUNERAL

26:52.625 --> 26:55.291
<i>Your grandma
is in that big box over there.</i>

26:55.375 --> 26:56.958
<i>She's being taken to the crematorium</i>

26:57.041 --> 26:58.291
<i>where she'll be burnt to ash.</i>

27:09.125 --> 27:12.375
Have a safe trip to heaven. Rest in peace.

27:12.458 --> 27:16.750
All attendance,
it's time for the three ceremonial bows.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.541
The first bow.

27:18.625 --> 27:19.958
The second bow.

27:20.041 --> 27:20.958
Rise.

27:22.750 --> 27:23.958
Where is my grandma?

27:24.583 --> 27:26.708
My grandma is inside this big box!

27:26.791 --> 27:28.666
-How come there's a child?
-Isn't she yours?

27:28.750 --> 27:31.083
Did you burn my grandma as well?

27:31.708 --> 27:32.750
Get out.

27:37.666 --> 27:38.708
Give me my grandma back!

27:41.000 --> 27:42.250
Give me my grandma back!

27:43.500 --> 27:44.458
Where is my grandma?

27:45.333 --> 27:46.416
Give me my grandma back!

27:53.916 --> 27:55.125
Give me my grandma back!

27:59.875 --> 28:00.708
Of course.

28:00.791 --> 28:01.666
Of course.

28:01.750 --> 28:02.666
Rest assured, sir.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.166
I will carry it out to the letter.

28:05.000 --> 28:05.875
You two,

28:05.958 --> 28:07.125
remember to…

28:10.416 --> 28:12.500
Remember to pay the fines later.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.333
You brought a child into this place

28:16.416 --> 28:18.458
and let her create a scene
at someone else's funeral.

28:18.541 --> 28:20.916
I don't even know this girl.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.541
She's the daughter of a friend.

28:22.625 --> 28:25.250
Then you're letting your friend down.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.458
You're letting your dad down.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.708
You're letting your sister…

28:31.041 --> 28:32.250
By the way, how is your sister?

28:32.333 --> 28:33.791
Don't mention her, please.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.208
You two divorced. Why bring her up?

28:36.291 --> 28:37.583
It was all because of you.

28:38.666 --> 28:39.625
Pay the fine

28:39.708 --> 28:40.666
or your van

28:40.750 --> 28:42.291
won't be allowed in the funeral parlor.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.333
What now?

28:47.416 --> 28:49.416
Were you sent by god to destroy my life?

28:49.500 --> 28:51.166
Perhaps you don't think
my life is bad enough.

28:52.666 --> 28:54.416
Go ahead and poke some more.
Stab me to death.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.291
I don't want to live anymore.
Just stab me.

28:57.250 --> 29:00.916
I thought my grandma was in that big box.

29:04.083 --> 29:04.916
Grandma.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.833
It's always her.

29:05.916 --> 29:06.958
Come. Get down.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.208
Do you see

29:10.291 --> 29:11.375
that big chimney over there?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.250
You grandma was burnt,
turned to ash and smoke,

29:13.333 --> 29:15.125
drifted up into the sky, and disappeared.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.250
You won't see her again.

29:16.333 --> 29:17.708
Do you understand?

29:17.791 --> 29:18.916
Do you understand now?

29:41.625 --> 29:43.958
Grandma.

29:46.791 --> 29:49.958
Grandma.

29:55.958 --> 29:57.416
Your grandma is not gone.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.125
She just went to another world.

30:03.541 --> 30:05.958
She was burnt and became ashes.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.625
Even if she's burned to ash,

30:07.708 --> 30:09.125
it's not the same as disappearing.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.041
It floats in the sky,

30:12.291 --> 30:13.208
right?

30:15.916 --> 30:16.833
Right?

30:22.125 --> 30:23.166
Yes.

30:23.958 --> 30:25.750
It went up into the sky

30:26.625 --> 30:27.750
and became a star.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.458
She became a star, yes.

30:29.541 --> 30:30.458
San.

30:31.875 --> 30:34.125
This is the stuff you asked for.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.375
It's customized, just like you ordered.

30:36.458 --> 30:38.083
See? Hand carving at its finest.

30:38.625 --> 30:39.666
Good. Thank you.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.791
I'm leaving then.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.541
Is this girl also going to become ashes?

30:46.000 --> 30:46.833
Yes.

30:47.541 --> 30:49.166
She's just like your grandma.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.458
She'll become a star too.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.750
<i>Xiaowen, where have you been again?</i>

31:28.083 --> 31:29.916
<i>Xiaowen, I made you
lotus roots with pork ribs.</i>

31:30.000 --> 31:31.208
<i>It's ready to eat.</i>

31:32.625 --> 31:34.541
YOU UNSENT A MESSAGE

31:34.625 --> 31:35.958
<i>Come home soon.</i>

31:36.041 --> 31:37.583
<i>Be careful on the way.</i>

31:39.750 --> 31:42.375
<i>Remember to drink a lot of water
when playing outside.</i>

31:42.458 --> 31:44.208
<i>Stand in the shade while you play.</i>

31:44.291 --> 31:46.541
<i>A girl won't look pretty</i>

31:46.625 --> 31:47.916
<i>with tanned skin.</i>

31:49.500 --> 31:53.333
<i>Baby, I got you a watermelon.
Come back and eat it.</i>

31:55.291 --> 31:57.666
<i>Xiaowen, it's your birthday today.</i>

31:57.750 --> 31:59.875
<i>Don't spend too long playing outside.</i>

32:01.083 --> 32:02.500
<i>Come home soon.</i>

32:02.583 --> 32:05.416
<i>I only asked you to get some garlic.
What took you so long?</i>

32:19.250 --> 32:20.750
What are you doing?

32:22.500 --> 32:24.375
Why on earth would I
have ever given you credit?

32:24.458 --> 32:25.458
What happened?

32:25.541 --> 32:26.708
What's going on?

32:28.166 --> 32:29.083
What happened?

32:31.166 --> 32:32.791
What did I tell you about her?

32:32.875 --> 32:34.958
This little devil is my archnemesis.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.333
You won't quit until you have me

32:37.416 --> 32:39.291
crushed beneath
the Five Finger Mountain, right?

32:40.916 --> 32:42.500
Are you drawing on a cinerary casket?

32:42.583 --> 32:43.833
What on earth were you thinking?

32:43.916 --> 32:44.875
Say it!

32:46.166 --> 32:47.208
Hello.

32:47.708 --> 32:48.916
The urn I ordered yesterday…

32:49.000 --> 32:50.583
How long will it take to get another one?

32:51.416 --> 32:52.416
Tomorrow morning?

32:52.500 --> 32:55.291
That's no good.
The cremation is at 9 a.m. today.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.333
I came to see you. I'm here.

33:09.375 --> 33:10.833
I'm here.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.250
I failed.

33:13.333 --> 33:15.458
I failed to look after you.

33:15.541 --> 33:18.041
I failed. I'm so sorry.

33:18.125 --> 33:19.666
I can't get rid of the drawing.

33:19.750 --> 33:20.625
Dish wash,

33:20.708 --> 33:21.666
disinfectant,

33:21.750 --> 33:23.166
gasoline, and alcohol.

33:23.250 --> 33:24.250
We've tried everything.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.875
Maybe we can talk them into

33:25.958 --> 33:26.916
changing it?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.500
Changing what?

33:28.583 --> 33:30.541
They wanted a customized cinerary casket,

33:30.625 --> 33:31.708
not an ashtray.

33:31.791 --> 33:33.041
Then what are we supposed to do?

33:57.250 --> 33:58.750
Open your eyes wide and look carefully.

33:58.833 --> 34:00.958
Watch how I'm getting ruined
because of you.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.416
Sir,

34:10.500 --> 34:11.791
we both have daughters.

34:12.416 --> 34:14.125
Looking at your wife sobbing this hard,

34:14.208 --> 34:15.291
it…

34:17.250 --> 34:18.791
It breaks my heart as well.

34:24.291 --> 34:25.833
My daughter…

34:26.541 --> 34:29.125
She wanted to express her grief
for a fellow child, so…

34:34.625 --> 34:35.708
Just take a look yourselves.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.750
We can see that
you put a lot of effort into this.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.083
Our daughter…

35:10.250 --> 35:12.000
She loved drawing.

35:20.208 --> 35:21.166
Where is your girl?

35:21.916 --> 35:23.000
My daughter

35:23.583 --> 35:24.541
is over there.

35:33.416 --> 35:34.958
We've been concentrating on our careers

35:35.708 --> 35:36.916
and it wasn't until
after our child fell sick

35:37.000 --> 35:38.916
did we realize
what the most important thing is.

35:39.708 --> 35:40.833
Be with her.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.500
Take this.

35:45.791 --> 35:47.416
No. This won't do.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.333
Sir, this won't do.

35:48.416 --> 35:49.875
-It's for the child.
-This money…

36:12.291 --> 36:14.375
UP SKY

36:18.875 --> 36:20.125
Eat. It's all yours.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.666
You even said

36:21.750 --> 36:23.500
she's a jinx and nemesis?

36:23.583 --> 36:24.958
I think she's a lucky star.

36:25.041 --> 36:27.208
She's not so annoying

36:27.750 --> 36:29.291
when she's not looking for her grandma.

36:34.833 --> 36:36.958
Don't eat stuff
that has fallen on the floor.

36:37.041 --> 36:38.500
There's still a lot left in the bowl.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.333
What is this?

36:52.750 --> 36:53.916
It's not for eating!

36:54.583 --> 36:55.708
-Spit it out!
-Spit it out!

36:55.791 --> 36:56.625
Spit it out!

36:56.708 --> 36:57.916
-Spit it out.
-Open your mouth.

36:58.833 --> 36:59.791
Now.

36:59.875 --> 37:01.125
Where is it?

37:01.208 --> 37:02.375
Did you swallow it?

37:03.916 --> 37:04.958
My grandma said

37:05.041 --> 37:06.583
every grain is the fruit of hard work.

37:25.083 --> 37:26.875
Someone actually took this
for food and ate it?

37:26.958 --> 37:29.083
You are such irresponsible parents.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.666
Can we take it out?

37:30.750 --> 37:31.833
Take some medicine first,

37:31.916 --> 37:34.291
eat Chinese chives or bananas,

37:34.375 --> 37:36.666
monitor her bowel movements
in the next two days,

37:36.750 --> 37:38.250
and see if it comes out with the feces.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.625
Have you found it yet?

37:56.708 --> 37:57.625
No.

38:04.208 --> 38:05.625
It's your turn now.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.583
She pooped it out.

38:30.666 --> 38:32.375
Well done, Xiaowen.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.291
You pooped it out.

38:34.375 --> 38:35.625
You pooped it out.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.041
Hello?

38:41.125 --> 38:42.416
You're back.

38:43.375 --> 38:44.375
No need.

38:44.458 --> 38:45.708
I'll bring her back.

38:45.791 --> 38:46.666
They're back.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.750
Pack up.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.250
Okay.

38:59.458 --> 39:00.791
The whole family went to Beijing for you.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.208
The trip cost me several months' wages.

39:03.291 --> 39:04.416
And look at you.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.208
You got the last place in the competition.

39:06.291 --> 39:07.458
How dare you?

39:08.125 --> 39:10.791
This child is getting ruined
because of you.

39:10.875 --> 39:12.458
I think you've been paying
too much attention

39:12.541 --> 39:13.791
on other people's kids.

39:16.291 --> 39:18.833
We're sorry for troubling you.

39:18.916 --> 39:20.458
Sir, about this receipt from the hospital,

39:20.541 --> 39:22.375
you can transfer the money to me

39:22.458 --> 39:25.333
-via the phone.
-Your mom didn't leave me a single cent,

39:25.416 --> 39:27.333
Why should I raise her up？

39:27.416 --> 39:28.291
If you want to keep her,

39:28.375 --> 39:30.541
I suggest you bring her back
to Sichuan and raise her there.

39:30.625 --> 39:32.916
You want me to look after
both of you and her.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.500
What have I done to deserve this?

39:34.583 --> 39:35.583
Are you kidding me?

39:35.666 --> 39:37.166
It's bad enough you don't earn much.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.416
It's exhausting for me.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.541
Why are you back?

39:40.875 --> 39:41.916
Can you

39:42.916 --> 39:44.083
be nice to the child?

39:44.166 --> 39:45.541
If you want to be nice to her,

39:45.625 --> 39:46.833
keep her.

39:46.916 --> 39:49.166
Go before you mess up our floor.

39:49.791 --> 39:51.000
What are you saying?

39:51.083 --> 39:52.916
-I don't care who you are.
-What did you say?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.166
You're such a jerk.

39:54.250 --> 39:55.416
-Say that again.
-I'll call the cops.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.416
-What did you say?
-Get out of the way.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.333
-I'll give you a good, hard slap.
-You're bad. I want to call the cops.

39:59.416 --> 40:00.291
-Wait.
-Scram.

40:00.375 --> 40:02.250
What an uncivilized creature.

40:03.333 --> 40:05.375
You've already come this far,

40:05.458 --> 40:06.375
how about

40:06.458 --> 40:09.041
you look after Xiaowen
for a few more days?

40:09.625 --> 40:11.125
You've seen what it's like here.

40:12.041 --> 40:14.708
I still need to work
on my wife about this.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.166
Sir.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.250
You really are treating us
like an orphanage.

40:18.333 --> 40:20.666
We sell graveclothes.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.541
I'll pay.

40:23.416 --> 40:24.333
Xiaowen,

40:24.416 --> 40:25.708
are you willing

40:25.791 --> 40:27.041
to stay here

40:27.125 --> 40:29.375
or would you go with them?

40:46.291 --> 40:47.916
<i>What on earth
got into your head this time?</i>

40:48.000 --> 40:50.458
Don't you think our last few days
have been exhilarating enough?

40:50.541 --> 40:52.166
So we're keeping her here again, fine.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.833
But why did you refuse to take the money?

40:53.916 --> 40:54.958
You said it yourself,

40:55.041 --> 40:57.541
"She's my archenemy. My nemesis."

40:57.625 --> 40:59.958
Are you the Monkey King?
Changing your form daily?

41:00.041 --> 41:01.750
You're right,

41:01.833 --> 41:03.833
I am the Monkey King

41:03.916 --> 41:06.791
and I don't like seeing
those devils bully her.

41:16.791 --> 41:18.041
What are you doing here?

41:20.541 --> 41:22.625
What's going on? What's wrong with you?

41:22.708 --> 41:24.541
Your brother-in-law said
you were with a child

41:24.625 --> 41:26.291
and made a whole mess at the parlor.

41:27.083 --> 41:29.333
That stammerer is also a snitch.

41:29.416 --> 41:31.458
-You've learned to swear?
-Dad…

41:31.541 --> 41:33.000
I'm going to teach you a good lesson

41:33.083 --> 41:34.708
-in front of the crowd here.
-Do it then.

41:34.791 --> 41:35.833
Hit me.

41:35.916 --> 41:37.458
-Hit me here. Do it.
-I…

41:37.541 --> 41:38.708
You can't hit San.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.500
This is the child.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.458
Hurry and send her back.

41:50.541 --> 41:54.291
The crematorium is no place for a kid.

41:54.375 --> 41:55.541
When I was her age,

41:55.625 --> 41:57.583
you'd already taught me
how to dress up the dead.

41:57.666 --> 41:58.916
Nonsense.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.083
Don't forget your trial period isn't over.

42:01.166 --> 42:02.375
If you still want the house…

42:02.458 --> 42:03.625
Fine.

42:03.708 --> 42:06.291
He has been threatening me
with this stupid house for over a year.

42:06.375 --> 42:07.833
He never wanted to give it to me.

42:07.916 --> 42:08.833
You shut up.

42:10.583 --> 42:11.750
How about this?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.708
I will buy this house from you.

42:13.791 --> 42:15.125
You can't afford it.

42:15.208 --> 42:16.500
Give me a quote.

42:16.583 --> 42:17.958
Three hundred thousand yuan?

42:18.041 --> 42:19.375
Five hundred thousand yuan?

42:19.458 --> 42:21.666
-A million?
-Sanmei, are you crazy?

42:21.750 --> 42:22.875
Three hundred thousand yuan

42:22.958 --> 42:24.666
in 30 days

42:24.750 --> 42:27.750
or get out of my house.

42:27.833 --> 42:28.875
Sir.

42:30.583 --> 42:31.416
Sir.

42:34.416 --> 42:36.250
There's a child to look after

42:36.333 --> 42:38.375
and a house to buy.

42:38.458 --> 42:41.291
I'm definitely
going to have insomnia tonight.

43:17.708 --> 43:19.333
WE ARE GETTING MARRIED

43:33.083 --> 43:35.041
Tell me your cell phone number.

43:35.625 --> 43:37.583
Stop bothering me.

43:37.666 --> 43:39.375
Just tell me.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.666
1738

43:45.750 --> 43:47.791
6037884.

44:02.791 --> 44:05.083
You're crushed beneath
the Five Finger Mountain for real.

44:10.375 --> 44:13.291
I wouldn't have been crushed
beneath the mountain

44:13.375 --> 44:15.750
if you hadn't done what you did
at the funeral parlor.

44:15.833 --> 44:17.958
If I'm stuck underneath the mountain,

44:18.583 --> 44:20.500
you won't get any closer
to finding your grandma.

44:32.291 --> 44:34.458
Do you have a hole in your jaw
where food leaks out?

44:36.666 --> 44:38.458
It has fallen out. Don't eat it.

44:39.833 --> 44:42.791
It's less than three seconds,
so it's still safe to eat.

44:42.875 --> 44:44.416
My grandma told me that.

44:45.833 --> 44:47.833
I'm going to have to lay
some ground rules here.

44:47.916 --> 44:48.791
First,

44:48.875 --> 44:52.458
chew and swallow slowly when eating.

44:52.541 --> 44:53.375
Second,

44:55.000 --> 44:57.333
food on the ground is dirty,
so don't eat it.

44:57.416 --> 44:59.291
Not exactly clean

44:59.375 --> 45:00.666
but won't exactly get sick.

45:00.750 --> 45:02.000
My grandma told me that.

45:02.083 --> 45:03.000
Third,

45:03.083 --> 45:04.958
stop mentioning your grandma.

45:05.041 --> 45:07.291
Forget about her from today.

45:08.333 --> 45:09.416
Fourth,

45:09.500 --> 45:11.041
no biting people.

45:17.041 --> 45:18.791
So jumpy.

45:20.750 --> 45:21.583
Where are you going?

45:21.666 --> 45:23.666
I'm having a shit!

45:23.750 --> 45:24.625
Fifth,

45:24.708 --> 45:26.708
stop talking like that!

45:26.791 --> 45:28.291
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

45:28.375 --> 45:30.083
Three hundred thousand yuan in one month.

45:30.166 --> 45:32.541
Why don't we just give up
like what you suggested?

45:32.625 --> 45:34.791
I got us into this. I'll handle it myself.

45:34.875 --> 45:36.791
Your handling caused this.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.833
Why did you have
to fight your dad like that?

45:40.791 --> 45:42.500
He didn't like seeing you with Xiaowen,

45:42.583 --> 45:44.250
so just send her back home for a while,

45:44.333 --> 45:45.541
wait until he calms down a bit,

45:45.625 --> 45:46.750
and that will be it.

45:46.833 --> 45:49.000
Kowtow, apologize, and the case is closed.

45:49.083 --> 45:51.125
If he won't allow me to have her,
the more I'll do it.

45:51.208 --> 45:52.833
I'll look after her
so that he can watch me do it.

45:53.750 --> 45:54.583
Xiaowen.

45:56.833 --> 45:57.666
Xiaowen.

46:01.833 --> 46:03.458
XIAONEZHA

46:04.708 --> 46:05.583
Hello?

46:06.083 --> 46:07.291
<i>San,</i>

46:07.375 --> 46:09.083
<i>come to the park.</i>

46:10.708 --> 46:12.416
This is Mr. Liu.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.333
He used to dance with my grandma.

46:14.416 --> 46:15.791
This is San.

46:15.875 --> 46:19.333
He's the one that turned
my grandma into a star.

46:20.166 --> 46:21.791
I'll let you two talk.

46:22.416 --> 46:24.208
I want to hold a funeral.

46:24.833 --> 46:25.708
For whom?

46:25.791 --> 46:26.750
For myself.

46:29.666 --> 46:30.500
Sir.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.625
A little girl can be excused
for being a child.

46:32.708 --> 46:34.833
With your age,
you shouldn't talk nonsense.

46:34.916 --> 46:36.416
What is your problem?

46:36.500 --> 46:37.500
Let's go.

46:37.583 --> 46:40.166
Talk with him a little more, San.

46:40.250 --> 46:41.625
Don't grab me like that.

46:41.708 --> 46:44.833
I don't really have much to live for,

46:44.916 --> 46:47.000
so I just want to see my funeral
with my own eyes,

46:47.083 --> 46:49.083
I'll pay if that's what
you're worried about.

46:49.166 --> 46:50.625
How much can you pay?

46:50.708 --> 46:52.625
How much can a funeral cost?

46:52.708 --> 46:54.958
Well, that depends
on the type of funeral you want.

46:55.041 --> 46:57.458
In ancient times, when a poor person dies,

46:57.541 --> 46:59.000
you just pack him up
in a bamboo sleeping mat.

46:59.083 --> 47:00.208
But when an emperor dies,

47:00.291 --> 47:02.208
the entire nation mourns with their tears

47:02.291 --> 47:04.458
and it might even cost
half the gold in the treasury.

47:04.541 --> 47:06.500
Then I think I'll have
the emperor's funeral.

47:06.583 --> 47:07.958
Are you crazy?

47:08.041 --> 47:09.583
I will pay you 300,000.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.208
If you guys can do it,

47:13.291 --> 47:15.083
I'll put the deposit down right away.

47:18.041 --> 47:18.958
Of course we can.

47:19.791 --> 47:20.791
Deal.

47:21.333 --> 47:22.291
Deal.

47:23.875 --> 47:24.791
Cheers.

47:25.791 --> 47:27.250
Cheers.

47:27.333 --> 47:28.541
It's a success.

47:31.375 --> 47:35.041
So it has come full circle.

47:35.125 --> 47:36.958
Our Xiaowen may have done something wrong

47:37.041 --> 47:38.666
and got us into trouble
in the first place,

47:38.750 --> 47:41.083
but in the blink of an eye,
she has made up for it.

47:42.416 --> 47:44.875
I think we should probably
think more carefully about this.

47:44.958 --> 47:46.708
Why would anyone
want to spend so much money

47:46.791 --> 47:48.958
to hold such a ridiculous funeral
for oneself?

47:49.041 --> 47:52.041
There are all kinds of birds
in a big forest.

47:53.625 --> 47:54.500
<i>Costume.</i>

47:54.583 --> 47:55.500
<i>Setting.</i>

47:55.583 --> 47:58.208
<i>Baixue, look for it
at your theater company.</i>

47:58.291 --> 47:59.125
<i>Jianren,</i>

47:59.208 --> 48:01.541
I'll leave you to find the extras.

48:01.625 --> 48:03.708
Don't miss this!
Placements for a period production.

48:03.791 --> 48:05.000
It's paid work.

48:07.083 --> 48:08.916
<i>Our general principle is</i>

48:09.416 --> 48:11.416
<i>to save every penny we can.</i>

48:11.500 --> 48:12.750
<i>-Come on.
-Let's drink.</i>

48:21.791 --> 48:23.208
It's 100 yuan for a day's work, sir.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.208
It's 100 yuan.

48:25.833 --> 48:27.625
Paid work. Have a look.

48:29.375 --> 48:31.583
<i>Xiaowen, I understand you the best.</i>

48:32.625 --> 48:35.916
<i>I didn't have a happy childhood.</i>

48:36.000 --> 48:37.208
Cheers. Empty the cup.

48:38.291 --> 48:39.791
URGENT HIRING FOR A PERIOD PRODUCTION

48:41.000 --> 48:42.250
How much for a day's work?

48:46.250 --> 48:47.875
Tears pour down

48:48.666 --> 48:49.833
from the Heavens.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.166
Mother Earth

48:53.250 --> 48:54.666
wails in lamentation.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.541
The mountains are rocking.

48:57.625 --> 48:58.833
The rivers are shaking.

48:58.916 --> 49:01.125
Dimmed are the sun

49:01.208 --> 49:03.791
and the moon.

49:04.416 --> 49:05.833
And the Emperor

49:06.458 --> 49:09.291
is no more with us.

49:10.625 --> 49:13.083
Play the music!

49:21.708 --> 49:23.708
Can't they cry louder?

49:24.291 --> 49:26.041
Louder.

49:26.125 --> 49:27.625
Cry like you're heartbroken

49:27.708 --> 49:28.708
and look sad.

49:28.791 --> 49:30.833
No tears, no pay.

49:32.333 --> 49:34.458
Louder!

49:37.208 --> 49:38.958
You cry as well.

49:43.958 --> 49:46.125
Your majesty!

49:47.583 --> 49:49.500
Your majesty!

49:50.125 --> 49:51.000
Dad?

49:51.833 --> 49:53.166
I can't believe my eyes.

49:53.250 --> 49:54.958
You bring shame upon our family name.

49:56.166 --> 49:57.375
Which one of you is Mo Sanmei?

49:57.458 --> 49:58.458
Which one?

49:58.541 --> 49:59.708
It's him.

49:59.791 --> 50:00.916
-See?
-Run!

50:03.375 --> 50:06.833
Go get them!

50:07.833 --> 50:09.583
They are here!

50:11.375 --> 50:13.041
Get our money back!

50:19.958 --> 50:22.458
-Go!
-Let me go!

50:25.500 --> 50:26.916
Let me go!

50:36.625 --> 50:39.583
HUAI'AN ROAD POLICE STATION

50:49.708 --> 50:51.333
What are you doing?

50:51.833 --> 50:53.333
My grandma taught me this.

50:53.416 --> 50:55.291
It relieves the pain
and prevents inflammation.

51:01.958 --> 51:03.458
All right.

51:07.083 --> 51:08.500
Put your signatures down.

51:16.583 --> 51:17.583
You can go now.

51:23.166 --> 51:25.416
A moment, please, San.

51:25.500 --> 51:29.291
Do you think that I was being ridiculous?

51:29.375 --> 51:31.166
And that I was out of my mind?

51:32.375 --> 51:33.500
Two years ago,

51:34.083 --> 51:35.500
our old house
got demolished for redevelopment

51:35.583 --> 51:37.458
and we received a compensation package.

51:37.541 --> 51:38.791
Since then,

51:38.875 --> 51:41.625
the family hasn't seen
a single day of peace.

51:42.750 --> 51:43.791
Do you mean

51:44.666 --> 51:46.166
that's why you came up with the idea

51:46.250 --> 51:47.333
to spend all the money?

51:47.416 --> 51:49.291
When Xiaowen came to me that day,

51:49.375 --> 51:53.708
she wanted me to withdraw
her late grandma's money from the bank.

51:54.875 --> 51:57.750
She said that you were in trouble

51:57.833 --> 52:00.666
and she wanted to help you move
the Five Finger Mountain.

52:02.916 --> 52:04.833
<i>Xiaowen told me that</i>

52:04.916 --> 52:06.208
<i>from now on,</i>

52:06.291 --> 52:08.458
<i>she's going to live with you.</i>

52:09.125 --> 52:12.375
<i>I really wanted to help you.</i>

52:14.000 --> 52:18.416
<i>Her grandma had a hard life</i>

52:19.250 --> 52:22.416
<i>and didn't have a lot of savings.</i>

52:24.916 --> 52:25.958
<i>Young man,</i>

52:26.500 --> 52:29.416
<i>please be good to Xiaowen.</i>

52:29.500 --> 52:33.041
<i>I thank you on her grandma's behalf.</i>

52:37.375 --> 52:38.458
Don't break things.

52:38.541 --> 52:39.791
Dad.

52:39.875 --> 52:42.250
Dad, please stop breaking things.

52:42.333 --> 52:44.291
I'm going to destroy this place

52:44.375 --> 52:46.041
once and for all today.

52:46.125 --> 52:47.625
I'd rather burn the place down

52:47.708 --> 52:51.000
than see you disgrace it any further.

52:51.083 --> 52:53.250
A funeral for the living?

52:53.333 --> 52:55.250
No one in our industry
has ever done such a thing.

52:55.333 --> 52:57.375
Well, there has to be
a first in everything, right?

52:57.458 --> 52:59.500
So I'm the first.
Now there's an example to follow.

52:59.583 --> 53:00.416
Old man.

53:01.125 --> 53:03.041
I accepted the job, not San.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.833
If you must hit someone, then hit me.

53:05.708 --> 53:06.833
Look at you.

53:06.916 --> 53:08.125
Look at you.

53:08.208 --> 53:11.583
Pack your things and move out
before the month's end.

53:11.666 --> 53:12.583
Sir,

53:12.666 --> 53:13.625
please calm down.

53:13.708 --> 53:14.833
We'll definitely change.

53:14.916 --> 53:16.166
How am I supposed to change?

53:17.041 --> 53:18.625
How do I change? Into what?

53:19.458 --> 53:21.916
No matter what I do,
it's always wrong in his eyes.

53:23.416 --> 53:25.208
When I was a kid,
I wanted to watch cartoons.

53:25.291 --> 53:26.958
I didn't want to follow him to the parlor.

53:27.041 --> 53:27.875
He beat me up for it.

53:27.958 --> 53:29.916
When others mocked me
about how I make money off the dead

53:30.000 --> 53:31.166
and I had a fight with them,

53:31.250 --> 53:32.458
what did he do?

53:32.541 --> 53:33.875
He watched from upstairs,

53:33.958 --> 53:35.625
then he turned around and went inside
without doing anything.

53:35.708 --> 53:36.833
Sanmei!

53:36.916 --> 53:38.958
Dad, I just want to ask you one thing.

53:39.041 --> 53:41.291
I know you prefer my older brother.

53:41.375 --> 53:43.041
He's your favorite son.

53:43.125 --> 53:44.166
How about this?

53:44.250 --> 53:46.250
You beat me to death
and I'll swap places with him.

53:46.333 --> 53:47.625
He'll come back and be with you.

53:47.708 --> 53:48.625
Sanmei!

54:14.833 --> 54:17.166
BUSINESS LICENSE

54:40.875 --> 54:42.125
What are you crying about?

54:44.208 --> 54:47.583
Did I get you in trouble again?

54:51.916 --> 54:52.833
Look.

54:53.625 --> 54:55.875
I fixed your red-tasseled spear.

55:03.708 --> 55:05.125
It's not your fault.

55:06.916 --> 55:08.125
It's my fault.

55:08.750 --> 55:10.416
I don't have what it takes to make it.

55:12.500 --> 55:13.666
It's all right. Stop crying.

55:13.750 --> 55:14.916
Sleep now.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.666
After you fall asleep,

55:18.000 --> 55:19.458
the star in the sky

55:20.291 --> 55:22.250
will come down and appear in your dreams

55:22.833 --> 55:24.208
as your grandma

55:24.291 --> 55:25.333
and chat with you.

55:26.083 --> 55:27.291
Really?

55:27.375 --> 55:28.791
Try it.

55:29.875 --> 55:32.125
My watch is broken.

55:32.208 --> 55:34.333
Can you fix it for me?

55:38.125 --> 55:39.583
No problem.

55:39.666 --> 55:41.375
Can I borrow your pen?

55:49.791 --> 55:50.833
Give me your hand.

56:20.541 --> 56:21.666
All right.

56:21.750 --> 56:24.166
Wear this watch
for a few days as a replacement.

56:24.250 --> 56:25.125
Sleep now.

56:41.583 --> 56:44.291
We don't play with the uncultured, son.

56:44.375 --> 56:46.791
Come, let's recite a Tang poem.

56:46.875 --> 56:47.791
"On the Stork Tower"

56:48.375 --> 56:49.875
by Wang Zhihuan, Tang Dynasty.

56:50.500 --> 56:53.458
<i>The sun beyond the mountain glows</i>

56:54.000 --> 56:56.708
<i>The Yellow River seaward flows</i>

56:56.791 --> 56:57.875
Louder.

56:57.958 --> 57:00.583
<i>You can enjoy a grander sight</i>

57:00.666 --> 57:03.333
<i>By climbing to a greater height</i>

57:03.958 --> 57:05.875
Come, Xiaowen.

57:07.375 --> 57:08.416
It's time to eat.

57:17.541 --> 57:19.791
It's time for her to go to school.

57:19.875 --> 57:21.375
I should be paying the fees.

57:21.458 --> 57:22.583
You see.

57:23.416 --> 57:24.875
This is my sister's

57:25.833 --> 57:27.166
and this is my mom's.

57:28.125 --> 57:29.541
Xiaowen is such a poor child.

57:30.208 --> 57:32.625
It's all because
of my sister's bad relationships.

57:32.708 --> 57:35.958
We still don't know who the dad is.

57:36.041 --> 57:37.250
My sister is dead

57:37.333 --> 57:39.041
and so is my mom,

57:39.125 --> 57:40.833
I should be the one raising her.

57:41.708 --> 57:43.333
But look at me,

57:45.000 --> 57:46.458
no one listens to me in my own house.

57:46.541 --> 57:48.125
Enough.

57:48.208 --> 57:50.500
A grown man shouldn't cry like a baby.

57:51.541 --> 57:53.208
Just tell me what you want.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.583
Why don't you just adopt her?

57:59.416 --> 58:01.375
<i>According to Article 9
of the Adoption Law,</i>

58:01.458 --> 58:03.666
in the case of single males
attempting to adopt females,

58:03.750 --> 58:05.958
there should be an age gap
between the two parties

58:06.041 --> 58:07.416
of at least 40 years.

58:09.708 --> 58:10.916
What does that mean?

58:11.000 --> 58:13.708
He's unmarried,
therefore ineligible for adoption.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.625
San, why are you here?

58:29.708 --> 58:31.375
I've brought some late-night snacks.

58:32.833 --> 58:33.750
Here.

58:41.041 --> 58:42.708
I want to adopt Xiaowen.

58:42.791 --> 58:43.875
That's great.

58:43.958 --> 58:45.458
But the Civil Affairs Bureau says that

58:45.541 --> 58:47.000
since I'm unmarried,

58:47.083 --> 58:48.208
I can't adopt her.

58:49.083 --> 58:50.958
I can smell perfume on you.

58:54.291 --> 58:55.416
Is it obvious?

58:58.125 --> 59:00.000
-So perhaps we should…
-You can wash up now.

59:04.708 --> 59:05.875
When did you get here?

59:05.958 --> 59:08.041
Well, since you've seen us together now,
there's no need to hide anymore.

59:08.125 --> 59:09.416
We got the marriage certificate.

59:30.583 --> 59:32.250
From now on, we're family, Xiaowen.

59:32.333 --> 59:34.000
Right, hold it up.

59:34.083 --> 59:34.958
Take a picture.

59:35.041 --> 59:35.875
Come on.

59:36.875 --> 59:38.000
One, two,

59:38.083 --> 59:39.250
three.

59:50.416 --> 59:52.458
Here, sign it.

59:56.500 --> 59:58.166
-I'm not going in!
-Be a good kid, Xiaowen.

59:58.250 --> 1:00:00.541
-Listen, kindergarten is fun.
-I'm not going!

1:00:00.625 --> 1:00:01.541
-School is no fun!
-Let go.

1:00:01.625 --> 1:00:02.666
-You let go first.
-You let go!

1:00:02.750 --> 1:00:04.500
-You first!
-Fine, I'm letting you go.

1:00:08.250 --> 1:00:09.750
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

1:00:09.833 --> 1:00:11.000
I never went to kindergarten.

1:00:11.083 --> 1:00:12.500
-Bye.
-Isn't that so?

1:00:14.583 --> 1:00:16.958
Fine, if we're not going,
then we're not going.

1:00:17.041 --> 1:00:17.875
Come on.

1:00:17.958 --> 1:00:19.708
-Let's go home and play mahjong.
-Let's go.

1:00:23.291 --> 1:00:25.666
I'm not going in!

1:00:25.750 --> 1:00:27.333
Let me go! I'm not going in!

1:00:27.416 --> 1:00:29.250
Look. It's pretty messed up in there.

1:00:29.833 --> 1:00:31.083
Normally, we couldn't fix it.

1:00:31.166 --> 1:00:32.541
You're better off with a new one.

1:00:36.833 --> 1:00:38.458
This property benefits greatly

1:00:38.541 --> 1:00:40.833
from excellent lighting conditions
and soundproofing.

1:00:41.916 --> 1:00:43.041
Take a look at this bed

1:00:43.125 --> 1:00:44.291
and this desk,

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:46.041
they are ready for use.

1:00:46.125 --> 1:00:47.958
Later, after your child
finishes school day,

1:00:48.041 --> 1:00:49.041
bring her here.

1:00:49.125 --> 1:00:50.458
I guarantee she'll like it.

1:00:51.541 --> 1:00:52.750
JUNE 28TH, MONDAY

1:00:52.833 --> 1:00:54.000
I'll call you back.

1:00:54.083 --> 1:00:56.083
Don't worry. He's coming soon.

1:01:04.958 --> 1:01:05.916
The latest model.

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.041
Try it on.

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:10.375
Does it have my grandma's voice?

1:01:11.958 --> 1:01:13.166
Your grandma's voice

1:01:13.250 --> 1:01:14.916
was in the old watch.

1:01:16.375 --> 1:01:19.250
Can't the old watch be fixed?

1:01:20.791 --> 1:01:24.833
I will never hear
my grandma's voice again, will I?

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:28.000
That's nonsense.

1:01:29.625 --> 1:01:30.750
Tell me. Who am I?

1:01:30.833 --> 1:01:32.416
You're the Monkey King.

1:01:32.958 --> 1:01:34.291
That's right.

1:01:34.375 --> 1:01:35.541
I cast a spell

1:01:35.625 --> 1:01:37.791
and your grandma's voice
will magically come back.

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:42.583
Keep drawing.

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.333
WORK NOTES

1:01:55.416 --> 1:01:57.583
SEVERE JOINT PAIN…

1:02:07.958 --> 1:02:09.333
What are you doing here?

1:02:09.416 --> 1:02:11.625
Laoliu is gone.

1:02:11.708 --> 1:02:13.333
He's gone? Go find him then.

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.125
He crashed into a ten-wheeler truck.

1:02:19.208 --> 1:02:21.875
Both he and his car got mashed together.

1:02:21.958 --> 1:02:24.041
Since he was drunk
and on the wrong side of the road,

1:02:24.708 --> 1:02:26.416
it was entirely his fault
and responsibility.

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:28.333
So I had to sell the store
to pay compensation.

1:02:28.416 --> 1:02:30.708
I have no money now.

1:02:31.958 --> 1:02:33.458
His family wants to pay last respects,

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:34.750
but I don't think they can

1:02:34.833 --> 1:02:35.750
because…

1:02:35.833 --> 1:02:37.625
Because his body was crushed so badly.

1:02:37.708 --> 1:02:40.000
It was horribly disfigured.

1:02:42.958 --> 1:02:45.125
Repairing his appearance at the parlor
is too expensive.

1:02:45.208 --> 1:02:46.333
You're in this line of work.

1:02:46.416 --> 1:02:47.958
What line of work do you think I'm in?

1:02:50.291 --> 1:02:52.000
-Sanmei.
-Get off me.

1:02:52.083 --> 1:02:53.291
Please help me.

1:02:53.375 --> 1:02:54.875
Stop calling me Sanmei.

1:02:54.958 --> 1:02:57.000
I hate people calling me
by my full first name.

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.166
And I'm very busy now.

1:02:58.250 --> 1:03:00.875
I don't have the time
to argue with you. Just leave.

1:03:10.791 --> 1:03:11.916
Wait.

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.875
I know who you are.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:17.041
Don't say that.

1:03:19.875 --> 1:03:22.375
You're the one on San's cell phone.

1:03:23.208 --> 1:03:26.291
Whenever he looks at your picture,
he would cry.

1:03:26.375 --> 1:03:27.416
Don't say things like that.

1:03:36.750 --> 1:03:38.541
Why are you still here?

1:03:39.291 --> 1:03:41.416
With our relationship, I was in the wrong.

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.708
I admit it. We hurt you.

1:03:43.791 --> 1:03:45.125
No, you didn't.

1:03:45.625 --> 1:03:47.041
I was over you a long while ago.

1:03:47.125 --> 1:03:47.958
Go.

1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:51.041
On behalf of Laoliu, I apologize.

1:03:51.125 --> 1:03:52.166
San.

1:03:52.666 --> 1:03:54.041
I'm sorry.

1:04:02.125 --> 1:04:03.166
Get up.

1:04:03.250 --> 1:04:04.583
It's not good for the baby.

1:04:04.666 --> 1:04:06.875
Then will you help?

1:04:11.083 --> 1:04:12.958
This job is not something I can do.

1:04:13.041 --> 1:04:14.375
My dad can,

1:04:15.333 --> 1:04:16.791
but we're not on speaking terms lately.

1:04:16.875 --> 1:04:18.166
I'll go.

1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.083
I'm not afraid of him.

1:04:37.458 --> 1:04:38.708
Old man.

1:04:41.875 --> 1:04:43.750
San wants to tell you something,

1:04:43.833 --> 1:04:45.958
but please don't scold him.

1:04:50.541 --> 1:04:53.541
Why should I listen to you then?

1:04:54.833 --> 1:04:56.875
You have to.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:04:59.666
Then call me grandpa

1:04:59.750 --> 1:05:00.958
and I'll listen to you.

1:05:01.041 --> 1:05:02.875
Grandpa.

1:05:02.958 --> 1:05:04.125
Louder.

1:05:04.208 --> 1:05:05.333
Grandpa!

1:05:07.083 --> 1:05:08.958
My granddaughter wants me for something.

1:05:09.041 --> 1:05:10.291
You guys carry on.

1:05:10.375 --> 1:05:11.375
Let's go then.

1:05:22.958 --> 1:05:24.208
No arguing.

1:05:24.708 --> 1:05:25.541
Lay it out.

1:05:36.208 --> 1:05:38.750
I don't drink your counterfeit alcohol.

1:05:40.916 --> 1:05:42.291
This is genuine.

1:05:42.375 --> 1:05:44.250
It cost me over 2,000 yuan.

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:56.416
Don't let your sister know.

1:05:57.708 --> 1:05:59.666
So even you are afraid of someone.

1:06:05.583 --> 1:06:06.750
Tell me then.

1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:09.708
For what business do you seek my help?

1:06:54.125 --> 1:06:55.000
You do it.

1:06:59.041 --> 1:07:00.125
I can't, Dad.

1:07:00.208 --> 1:07:01.208
I can't do this.

1:07:01.291 --> 1:07:02.333
You can do this.

1:07:02.875 --> 1:07:04.875
I taught you when you were little.

1:07:04.958 --> 1:07:06.291
Go and get the tools.

1:07:07.916 --> 1:07:08.833
What's his name…

1:07:08.916 --> 1:07:09.833
Jianren,

1:07:09.916 --> 1:07:11.791
take that graph out.

1:07:19.083 --> 1:07:20.791
First, rebuild the skeleton.

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:44.166
First, straighten out the tendons.

1:07:44.916 --> 1:07:46.875
Second, put the bones back
where they belong.

1:07:47.375 --> 1:07:51.083
We go backward from toe to head.

1:07:52.625 --> 1:07:53.916
Limbs come first,

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.666
then the torso.

1:07:56.458 --> 1:07:58.166
The internal organs

1:07:58.250 --> 1:08:00.583
-must be in order.
-Must be in order.

1:08:00.666 --> 1:08:02.583
The face and the skull.

1:08:02.666 --> 1:08:05.000
-Twenty-three pieces in all.
-Twenty-three pieces in all.

1:08:05.083 --> 1:08:07.583
-Brows, eyes, nose, and mouth
-Brows, eyes, nose, and mouth

1:08:07.666 --> 1:08:09.958
-are firmly in the middle.
-are firmly in the middle.

1:08:12.875 --> 1:08:14.250
Stitch up.

1:08:44.750 --> 1:08:45.666
It's done.

1:08:59.041 --> 1:09:01.625
That's my son.

1:09:14.333 --> 1:09:15.958
Dad!

1:09:16.041 --> 1:09:16.875
Sir!

1:09:16.958 --> 1:09:18.541
Dad!

1:09:18.625 --> 1:09:19.458
Sir!

1:09:23.916 --> 1:09:25.583
<i>Why did you let him drink?</i>

1:09:25.666 --> 1:09:27.666
Are you trying to get him killed?

1:09:28.416 --> 1:09:31.000
I've been keeping this
to myself for a long time,

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:31.958
but all these years,

1:09:32.041 --> 1:09:33.541
when you weren't happy
with how things were going,

1:09:33.625 --> 1:09:35.125
you were blaming Dad for everything.

1:09:35.208 --> 1:09:36.958
You're so selfish.

1:09:39.625 --> 1:09:40.541
Dad.

1:09:42.166 --> 1:09:43.291
You're awake.

1:09:43.375 --> 1:09:45.041
You scared us to death there.

1:09:45.125 --> 1:09:46.583
I'm fine.

1:09:46.666 --> 1:09:48.333
Same old problem.

1:09:54.333 --> 1:09:55.208
Hello?

1:09:57.166 --> 1:09:58.458
Got it.

1:09:58.541 --> 1:10:00.000
What is it?

1:10:00.083 --> 1:10:02.500
Something came up at the kindergarten.

1:10:02.583 --> 1:10:04.416
Well, hurry up then.

1:10:05.375 --> 1:10:07.541
I'll live.

1:10:07.625 --> 1:10:09.250
Then I'll come back
as soon as I can, okay?

1:10:12.333 --> 1:10:13.916
Finally,

1:10:15.041 --> 1:10:17.666
he truly cares about something.

1:10:20.125 --> 1:10:21.458
-Thank you, everyone.
-Thank you, everyone.

1:10:21.541 --> 1:10:25.375
WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE
IN PARENT-CHILD CLASS

1:10:25.458 --> 1:10:26.333
Excellent.

1:10:26.416 --> 1:10:27.666
Now, the next item

1:10:27.750 --> 1:10:29.291
is a performance

1:10:29.375 --> 1:10:30.791
by Xiaowen and Xiaopang.

1:10:30.875 --> 1:10:32.750
Let's give them a round of applause.

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.083
He's my son.

1:10:37.375 --> 1:10:38.250
Kneel.

1:10:41.166 --> 1:10:45.375
The filial son breaks the bowl
and Paradise in the West opens its gates.

1:10:45.458 --> 1:10:46.458
Mom!

1:10:46.541 --> 1:10:48.583
Have a safe journey to the next world.

1:10:51.041 --> 1:10:52.416
I…

1:10:56.291 --> 1:10:57.125
On your feet.

1:10:57.208 --> 1:10:59.333
So basically this is what happened.

1:10:59.875 --> 1:11:01.166
This child's problem is merely

1:11:01.250 --> 1:11:02.541
a reflection of a bigger issue.

1:11:02.625 --> 1:11:04.958
There must be a bigger focus
on education from the parents.

1:11:05.041 --> 1:11:06.333
Our parent-child class

1:11:06.416 --> 1:11:08.458
is only once per month.

1:11:08.541 --> 1:11:11.083
Someone has to be here for her
no matter how busy you are.

1:11:11.166 --> 1:11:13.875
This is a drawing she made
in the art class yesterday.

1:11:13.958 --> 1:11:14.958
Take a look.

1:11:16.541 --> 1:11:18.000
Funeral wreaths and urns.

1:11:18.083 --> 1:11:19.166
The drawing looks

1:11:19.250 --> 1:11:20.708
so scary.

1:11:20.791 --> 1:11:22.416
So I asked her.

1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:24.041
What do your parents do for a living?

1:11:24.125 --> 1:11:25.041
She said,

1:11:25.125 --> 1:11:27.500
"My mom and dad plant stars."

1:11:27.583 --> 1:11:28.625
Plant…

1:11:29.750 --> 1:11:32.125
To be honest,
I had a pretty good guess already.

1:11:32.208 --> 1:11:35.583
So be careful
with your parenting methods, all right?

1:11:42.541 --> 1:11:43.500
Don't hit the child!

1:11:56.291 --> 1:11:57.375
Sorry.

1:11:57.458 --> 1:11:58.666
We apologize.

1:12:11.625 --> 1:12:12.500
<i>It will be</i>

1:12:12.583 --> 1:12:15.125
<i>your brother's death day in a few days.</i>

1:12:15.208 --> 1:12:18.333
Don't forget to burn
some spiritual money for him.

1:12:18.416 --> 1:12:19.416
Dad.

1:12:20.708 --> 1:12:21.791
My older brother

1:12:21.875 --> 1:12:23.583
must have been much better than me, right?

1:12:24.958 --> 1:12:26.333
Every new year,

1:12:26.416 --> 1:12:29.083
after we have kowtowed to our ancestors,

1:12:30.333 --> 1:12:33.750
I would order you to kneel
and do the same for your brother.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.666
That's why you've always hated him.

1:12:39.166 --> 1:12:42.750
You never really asked me about him.

1:12:45.083 --> 1:12:46.000
Dad.

1:12:46.083 --> 1:12:48.166
It's just a sniff.

1:12:50.291 --> 1:12:51.208
It was

1:12:52.458 --> 1:12:54.625
the summer of 1988.

1:12:56.125 --> 1:12:58.000
I took your brother

1:12:58.791 --> 1:13:01.291
to the Yangtze River to retrieve a body.

1:13:02.166 --> 1:13:04.375
It was a teenage boy

1:13:04.458 --> 1:13:06.416
that sank into the water.

1:13:08.208 --> 1:13:09.833
His mom

1:13:09.916 --> 1:13:12.958
was standing by the river
weeping uncontrollably.

1:13:14.791 --> 1:13:16.041
We went down

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:18.333
three times

1:13:19.166 --> 1:13:21.250
but couldn't find the boy's body.

1:13:22.541 --> 1:13:25.083
When I finally got out of the water,

1:13:25.750 --> 1:13:27.416
your brother was nowhere to be seen.

1:13:28.666 --> 1:13:30.791
He secretly went
under water again by himself.

1:13:34.416 --> 1:13:36.916
Your brother managed to find
the missing boy.

1:13:37.833 --> 1:13:39.791
The boy's body was retrieved,

1:13:42.083 --> 1:13:43.625
but your brother didn't come up.

1:13:48.250 --> 1:13:50.208
For someone already dead,

1:13:51.125 --> 1:13:54.208
our family lost a living soul.

1:14:01.708 --> 1:14:02.750
Life

1:14:04.583 --> 1:14:06.833
is like a book.

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:11.583
Each one has to reach
the last page somehow.

1:14:17.875 --> 1:14:19.208
In some books,

1:14:19.833 --> 1:14:21.875
there's a full stop at the very end.

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:24.458
In others,

1:14:25.416 --> 1:14:27.125
there's only an ellipsis.

1:14:28.583 --> 1:14:29.708
In life,

1:14:30.958 --> 1:14:32.208
nothing is bigger

1:14:33.291 --> 1:14:35.458
than death itself.

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:42.041
<i>Fame, wealth,</i>

1:14:42.125 --> 1:14:44.583
<i>all smoke and mirrors.</i>

1:14:44.666 --> 1:14:46.833
<i>One who does our line of work for a living</i>

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:49.916
<i>must have the heart of a saint.</i>

Are you the Monkey King?

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.208
Changing forms every day?

1:15:29.833 --> 1:15:30.666
Thank you.

1:15:31.250 --> 1:15:32.416
Thank you.

1:15:33.916 --> 1:15:35.083
Hello?

1:15:35.708 --> 1:15:36.875
Curly,

1:15:36.958 --> 1:15:37.875
it's me,

1:15:37.958 --> 1:15:38.875
San.

1:15:38.958 --> 1:15:40.125
So this is the situation here.

1:15:40.208 --> 1:15:41.625
There's data on my cell phone
that can't be retrieved now,

1:15:41.708 --> 1:15:43.041
but I'd like to recover the data.

1:15:49.833 --> 1:15:52.708
STUDY NOTES

1:15:59.875 --> 1:16:02.458
Do you happen to know anyone that

1:16:02.541 --> 1:16:04.708
can fix cell phones and smartwatches?

1:16:04.791 --> 1:16:05.958
What?

1:16:06.041 --> 1:16:07.125
He changed jobs?

1:16:07.208 --> 1:16:09.458
The sun is setting.

1:16:10.541 --> 1:16:12.583
It's the old man's last day
before cremation.

1:16:13.458 --> 1:16:16.041
Has everyone done their part?

1:16:17.458 --> 1:16:19.750
Has the filial son been keeping vigil?

1:16:20.750 --> 1:16:23.083
Why am I the only one chanting here?

1:16:24.041 --> 1:16:26.333
How about we all make some noise?

1:16:28.916 --> 1:16:29.833
<i>Hey.</i>

1:16:29.916 --> 1:16:31.041
<i>It's me,</i>

1:16:32.125 --> 1:16:32.958
San.

1:16:35.625 --> 1:16:36.708
So it can't be done?

1:16:38.125 --> 1:16:39.750
JUNE 12TH, 2021

1:16:39.833 --> 1:16:41.250
<i>Look at this scrawl.</i>

1:16:41.333 --> 1:16:43.541
It's like a dung beetle
did it by crawling.

1:17:02.458 --> 1:17:03.833
then no one else can.

1:17:03.916 --> 1:17:05.583
Everyone, please.
I'd really appreciate it.

1:17:15.833 --> 1:17:17.041
Well done.

1:17:24.666 --> 1:17:25.958
RETRIEVING THE DATA

1:17:27.291 --> 1:17:28.416
It's done.

1:17:43.250 --> 1:17:45.083
Three, four, five, six, seven.

1:17:45.166 --> 1:17:46.791

1:18:12.708 --> 1:18:13.625
Hey, look.

1:18:14.458 --> 1:18:17.125
Does Beans seem a bit different?

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.500
It has ears

1:18:20.583 --> 1:18:22.250
and eyes now.

1:18:22.750 --> 1:18:24.583
The tail is different too.

1:18:25.166 --> 1:18:26.125
Give it a squeeze.

1:18:29.375 --> 1:18:30.916
<i>I made you lotus roots with pork ribs.</i>

1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.416
<i>It's ready to eat, Xiaowen.</i>

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.250
<i>Where have you gone?</i>

1:18:35.250 --> 1:18:36.791
<i>Come home soon.</i>

1:18:36.875 --> 1:18:38.416
<i>Be careful on the way.</i>

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:42.458
<i>Remember to drink a lot of water
when playing outside.</i>

1:18:42.541 --> 1:18:44.375
<i>Stand in the shade while you play.</i>

1:18:44.458 --> 1:18:46.708
<i>A girl won't look pretty</i>

1:18:46.791 --> 1:18:48.000
<i>with tanned skin.</i>

1:18:49.916 --> 1:18:53.625
<i>Baby, I got you a watermelon.
Come back and eat it.</i>

1:18:55.208 --> 1:18:56.875
<i>Our Xiaowen is the prettiest.</i>

1:18:56.958 --> 1:18:59.625
<i>Our Xiaowen is the best.</i>

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:02.083
<i>Let's come home together.</i>

1:19:02.166 --> 1:19:05.458
<i>We'll get your favorite
gluttonous rice cake in brown sugar.</i>

1:19:07.458 --> 1:19:09.583
<i>Xiaowen, it's your birthday today.</i>

1:19:09.666 --> 1:19:12.166
<i>Don't spend too long playing outside.</i>

1:19:13.916 --> 1:19:15.208
<i>I bought you a new dress.</i>

1:19:15.291 --> 1:19:18.458
<i>Come back and try it on. See if it fits.</i>

1:19:19.833 --> 1:19:22.250
<i>Xiaowen, lock the door from the inside</i>

1:19:22.333 --> 1:19:25.625
<i>and don't open it no matter what.</i>

1:19:27.500 --> 1:19:30.291
<i>My big baby, please be patient.</i>

1:19:30.375 --> 1:19:32.166
<i>I'll be home soon.</i>

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.291
<i>Grandma</i>

1:19:35.375 --> 1:19:37.666
<i>is great at making braids.</i>

1:19:37.750 --> 1:19:40.458
<i>I'll make the prettiest braid
for you tomorrow.</i>

1:19:40.541 --> 1:19:43.125
<i>My granddaughter
is the prettiest of them all.</i>

1:19:48.625 --> 1:19:51.458
-Take another bite.
-Good morning.

1:19:51.541 --> 1:19:53.083
Xiaowen, wait.

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:54.958
-One moment.
-Your water bottle.

1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:56.833
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1:19:56.916 --> 1:19:58.458
Don't forget to drink water.

1:20:05.583 --> 1:20:06.958
How come you're here?

1:20:07.041 --> 1:20:09.750
This is my little sister, Haifei.

1:20:09.833 --> 1:20:11.958
She is Xiaowen's biological mom.

1:20:14.166 --> 1:20:15.166
Over here.

1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.958
Didn't you tell me that her mom is dead?

1:20:19.541 --> 1:20:21.375
So the death certificate
you showed me was fake?

1:20:22.041 --> 1:20:22.875
I…

1:20:22.958 --> 1:20:24.541
The certificate is real.

1:20:24.625 --> 1:20:26.750
This is a very complicated situation.

1:20:26.833 --> 1:20:28.041
It's like this…

1:20:29.375 --> 1:20:30.916
Tell him yourself.

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:32.208
I'm done.

1:20:34.750 --> 1:20:36.208
He's not lying, San.

1:20:38.250 --> 1:20:39.791
Where did you come from?

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:42.458
Why should I just believe
everything you said

1:20:42.541 --> 1:20:43.833
and do whatever you asked me to?

1:20:46.666 --> 1:20:47.791
Xiaowen

1:20:47.875 --> 1:20:51.083
was born at 9 a.m. on July 6th, 2015.

1:20:51.166 --> 1:20:53.416
The whole birthing process took 27 hours.

1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:56.541
She wouldn't come out no matter what,
so I had to have a C-section in the end.

1:20:56.625 --> 1:20:58.666
There's a diamond-shaped birthmark
on her left foot.

1:20:58.750 --> 1:21:01.333
If you still don't believe me,
we can do a DNA test.

1:21:02.791 --> 1:21:04.708
I'm not letting you do any silly tests.

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:16.500
Xiaowen.

1:21:18.625 --> 1:21:20.125
Have you ever met your mom?

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:22.541
I have no mom or dad.

1:21:22.625 --> 1:21:24.208
I jumped out of a crack

1:21:24.291 --> 1:21:25.625
in a stone.

1:22:28.750 --> 1:22:29.708
Sir.

1:22:30.791 --> 1:22:34.500
I've been waiting out here all these days.

1:22:35.375 --> 1:22:37.541
It seems none of us can sleep--

1:22:37.625 --> 1:22:39.250
Where the hell have you been?

1:22:45.750 --> 1:22:47.458
Where were you when her grandma died?

1:22:48.208 --> 1:22:50.708
Where were you when she was
causing trouble all over the place?

1:22:51.333 --> 1:22:53.583
Where were you when her aunt
kicked her out of the house?

1:22:54.416 --> 1:22:56.583
Finally, she has a place
she could call home

1:22:56.666 --> 1:22:58.333
and you're trying to take her away?

1:22:59.416 --> 1:23:01.000
Who gave you the right?

1:23:01.958 --> 1:23:04.291
You're right. I deserve so much blame.

1:23:09.083 --> 1:23:10.083
Are you out of your mind?

1:23:10.583 --> 1:23:12.625
I left home when I was a teenager.

1:23:12.708 --> 1:23:15.083
I followed some classmates
and stepped straight into society.

1:23:15.166 --> 1:23:17.458
I didn't achieve anything
and gave birth to a child.

1:23:17.541 --> 1:23:19.416
My boyfriend ran away
when he saw I was pregnant.

1:23:20.291 --> 1:23:22.166
I refused to give up my dreams,
so I went abroad.

1:23:22.250 --> 1:23:24.125
I did something bad
and ended up in prison.

1:23:24.208 --> 1:23:26.750
My mom couldn't contact me,
so I was presumed dead.

1:23:27.791 --> 1:23:29.541
But even in prison,

1:23:29.625 --> 1:23:31.625
I thought about Xiaowen every day.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.708
I know I'm a bad mom.

1:23:34.791 --> 1:23:36.208
I've been a terrible mom,

1:23:36.291 --> 1:23:37.416
but…

1:23:38.958 --> 1:23:40.416
But she's still my child.

1:23:42.208 --> 1:23:43.500
I…

1:23:43.583 --> 1:23:45.333
And I'm still her mom.

1:23:46.208 --> 1:23:48.208
She came out of me.

1:23:57.791 --> 1:24:00.458
This is not a decision
I can make it by myself.

1:24:02.166 --> 1:24:05.000
There's also my buddy,
Jianren, and Baixue.

1:24:05.083 --> 1:24:07.000
I can't make their decisions for them.

1:24:08.250 --> 1:24:11.541
Sir.

1:24:12.708 --> 1:24:13.750
Please.

1:24:14.708 --> 1:24:15.916
I beg you.

1:24:16.875 --> 1:24:18.458
Give her back to me.

1:24:25.666 --> 1:24:26.750
Please, I'm begging you.

1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:36.916
How about

1:24:37.666 --> 1:24:40.083
you give me three more days?

1:24:42.083 --> 1:24:43.291
HEARSE FOR RENT

1:24:44.666 --> 1:24:45.833
Look at you, San.

1:24:45.916 --> 1:24:47.791
Now that's a rare sight to behold.

1:24:48.916 --> 1:24:51.083
I learned it from the Internet.

1:24:51.166 --> 1:24:52.416
Try it. I hope it's not too bad.

1:24:59.541 --> 1:25:01.916
Why do you look unhappy?

1:25:03.166 --> 1:25:04.000
What?

1:25:06.333 --> 1:25:07.375
No.

1:25:07.458 --> 1:25:08.791
I don't look unhappy.

1:25:09.375 --> 1:25:11.625
Do you have a hole in your jaw
where food leaks out?

1:25:19.541 --> 1:25:21.041
Your grandma was right.

1:25:21.708 --> 1:25:23.208
Every grain is the fruit of hard work.

1:25:24.916 --> 1:25:27.916
My teacher says there's another
parent-child class tomorrow.

1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:29.666
A parent needs to be present.

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:31.250
Which one of you wants to go?

1:25:31.333 --> 1:25:32.625
-I do.
-I do.

1:25:32.708 --> 1:25:34.166
Only one though.

1:25:42.791 --> 1:25:43.833
I'll go.

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:47.750
HUAJIAJIA KINDERGARTEN

1:25:47.833 --> 1:25:50.583
-Go!
-Go!

1:25:51.166 --> 1:25:52.791
-Go!
-Go!

1:26:19.166 --> 1:26:23.458
-Mom, Dad, thank you for everything.
-Dad, thank you for everything.

1:26:25.750 --> 1:26:27.291
I know

1:26:27.375 --> 1:26:29.166
that you've been lying to me.

1:26:29.708 --> 1:26:32.291
I'll never see my grandma again.

1:26:33.458 --> 1:26:34.625
But

1:26:35.291 --> 1:26:37.041
I'm not afraid anymore

1:26:38.416 --> 1:26:39.625
because

1:26:40.666 --> 1:26:43.125
I have a dad now.

1:27:27.125 --> 1:27:28.500
What is your dad's name?

1:27:28.583 --> 1:27:30.291
Mo Sanmei.

1:27:32.083 --> 1:27:33.250
Where does he live?

1:27:33.333 --> 1:27:35.875
Up Sky, No. 73, Huai'an Road,

1:27:35.958 --> 1:27:37.500
Yuhua District, Yanjiang City.

1:27:38.958 --> 1:27:40.458
What is your dad's cell phone number?

1:27:42.291 --> 1:27:44.625
What are you doing so late at night?

1:27:45.833 --> 1:27:47.750
I'm so sleepy.

1:27:53.625 --> 1:27:54.791
You won't

1:27:57.750 --> 1:27:59.375
forget about me in the future?

1:28:07.541 --> 1:28:09.083
I'll find a small mirror for you.

1:28:47.166 --> 1:28:49.416
UP SKY

1:29:19.333 --> 1:29:21.583
These are things that she'd use regularly.

1:29:22.250 --> 1:29:24.500
-Her clothes, her favorite snacks,
-Okay.

1:29:24.583 --> 1:29:25.583
and her school backpack.

1:29:26.250 --> 1:29:27.541
She doesn't like drinking water,

1:29:27.625 --> 1:29:29.333
so you have to make sure
she drinks plenty.

1:29:31.875 --> 1:29:33.500
This cloth tiger is called Beans.

1:29:33.583 --> 1:29:36.416
Her grandma sewed it for her.
It's her favorite thing in the world.

1:29:36.500 --> 1:29:39.041
She likes grabbing the arm
of an adult when she sleeps.

1:29:39.125 --> 1:29:40.958
She likes putting her mouth here.

1:29:41.750 --> 1:29:43.583
She eats too fast.

1:29:43.666 --> 1:29:45.000
Also, you have to remind her that

1:29:45.083 --> 1:29:46.625
food on the ground shouldn't be eaten.

1:29:46.708 --> 1:29:48.125
I'm warning you.

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:50.833
You have to be good to her.

1:29:50.916 --> 1:29:53.416
I've been to prison,
so I don't mind going back again.

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:07.708
Here's some money.
It's not much, but you should take it.

1:30:07.791 --> 1:30:09.250
-I can't take this.
-Take it.

1:30:09.333 --> 1:30:11.166
-I can't take this.
-Take it! It's not for you.

1:30:11.250 --> 1:30:13.125
-It's for Xiaowen.
-San?

1:30:13.666 --> 1:30:14.875
Where is this?

1:30:16.291 --> 1:30:17.708
Who are you?

1:30:19.208 --> 1:30:22.625
Child, I am your mom.

1:30:22.708 --> 1:30:24.291
-I'm taking you home.
-I don't have a mom.

1:30:24.875 --> 1:30:26.333
-How can that be?
-Xiaowen.

1:30:26.416 --> 1:30:27.791
Xiaowen, listen to me.

1:30:27.875 --> 1:30:29.416
She really is your mom

1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:30.750
and she has come to take you home.

1:30:30.833 --> 1:30:33.541
-I'm not going with her. Let me go!
-Xiaowen.

1:30:33.625 --> 1:30:34.625
Let go!

1:30:34.708 --> 1:30:35.916
-I'm not going with her!
-Be good.

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.083
-Be good.
-I have no mom. I'm not going with her!

1:30:38.166 --> 1:30:40.333
Please let us go.

1:30:40.416 --> 1:30:41.250
Just let us go.

1:30:41.333 --> 1:30:43.833
I'm not going with her! Let me go!

1:30:43.916 --> 1:30:47.000
-Go. Drive!
-I'm not going with her! Let me go!

1:30:47.083 --> 1:30:48.000
San!

1:30:48.083 --> 1:30:49.666
Back here.

1:30:50.625 --> 1:30:52.625
San!

1:30:53.500 --> 1:30:54.833
-I'm not going with her!
-Be good.

1:30:54.916 --> 1:30:56.666
-Be good and come home with me.
-San!

1:31:01.333 --> 1:31:03.083
San!

1:31:07.375 --> 1:31:08.500
<i>Stop shouting, Xiaowen.</i>

1:31:08.583 --> 1:31:10.000
-San!
-Xiaowen.

1:31:10.666 --> 1:31:12.125
-San!
-Back here.

1:31:16.916 --> 1:31:18.500
Stop hitting and screaming.

1:31:18.583 --> 1:31:21.000

Dad!

1:32:15.875 --> 1:32:18.791
UP SKY

1:32:23.833 --> 1:32:26.083
You're always so full of yourself.

1:32:27.250 --> 1:32:28.708
Did you ask Xiaowen what she wanted?

1:32:31.375 --> 1:32:32.916
Did you ask us what we wanted?

1:32:34.166 --> 1:32:36.166
Technically, we're her parents!

1:32:37.791 --> 1:32:39.625
She's registered under my household.

1:32:40.625 --> 1:32:42.458
You're so selfish.

1:32:43.708 --> 1:32:45.583
You're so selfish.

1:32:46.416 --> 1:32:47.666
You're so selfish.

1:32:49.916 --> 1:32:51.958
You want to give up the business? Fine!

1:32:52.041 --> 1:32:53.375
Let's do it now!

1:32:53.458 --> 1:32:54.458
Pack our things.

1:32:54.541 --> 1:32:56.125
You are a heartless beast.

1:32:56.833 --> 1:32:58.291
No wonder your dad looks down on you!

1:32:58.916 --> 1:33:00.958
No wonder your girlfriend cheated on you!

1:33:05.875 --> 1:33:07.375
You don't deserve to be called human!

1:33:07.458 --> 1:33:08.583
Bastard.

1:33:18.083 --> 1:33:19.083

<i>so I've prepared a letter for you two.</i>

1:34:06.208 --> 1:34:08.875
<i>You shouldn't feel sad about my passing.</i>

1:34:09.666 --> 1:34:13.166
<i>Everyone has to face this inevitability.</i>

1:34:16.375 --> 1:34:17.375
<i>San,</i>

1:34:17.458 --> 1:34:20.041
<i>I'll leave
the funeral arrangements to you.</i>

1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.375
<i>Don't give me that big ceremony crap.</i>

1:34:24.458 --> 1:34:26.375
<i>I've seen enough of that in my lifetime.</i>

1:34:28.541 --> 1:34:31.541
<i>I want to leave this world clean and pure.</i>

1:34:31.625 --> 1:34:33.958
<i>Just like how I came into this world.</i>

1:34:35.291 --> 1:34:36.833
<i>Keep the spending low</i>

1:34:37.916 --> 1:34:38.791
<i>and remember this.</i>

1:34:39.583 --> 1:34:41.458
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

1:35:12.500 --> 1:35:15.791
<i>I'd like a customized funeral</i>

1:35:15.875 --> 1:35:18.000
<i>that's both dignified and inexpensive.</i>

1:35:19.833 --> 1:35:22.125
<i>Instead of splashing
on a ceremonial casket,</i>

1:35:22.208 --> 1:35:25.833
<i>I'd rather you spend
the money on a family feast.</i>

1:35:25.916 --> 1:35:27.833
<i>After the cremation,</i>

1:35:27.916 --> 1:35:31.041
<i>put me in that can.</i>

1:35:32.750 --> 1:35:34.708
<i>And the dispatching of my remains,</i>

1:35:34.791 --> 1:35:36.583
<i>I'll leave that to you.</i>

1:35:36.666 --> 1:35:40.500
<i>Think of this as a test from your dad.</i>

1:35:42.500 --> 1:35:45.000
<i>If you can't think of an answer,</i>

1:35:45.083 --> 1:35:47.500
<i>I'll just stay in the can</i>

1:35:47.583 --> 1:35:48.666
<i>and going nowhere.</i>

1:36:10.291 --> 1:36:12.208
My sister, how should we do this?

1:36:12.750 --> 1:36:13.791
How should we do what?

1:36:15.125 --> 1:36:17.458
How do we dispatch Dad's remains?

1:36:17.541 --> 1:36:19.458
Buried together with mom's, of course.

1:36:20.125 --> 1:36:23.166
No, Dad was very clear in his will.

1:36:23.250 --> 1:36:25.625
He said he wants a special funeral
that's different.

1:36:25.708 --> 1:36:27.291
Well, how special can a funeral be?

1:36:27.375 --> 1:36:29.125
Where else can we put it
if not underground?

1:36:29.208 --> 1:36:30.500
In the sky?
