03:57.452 --> 03:59.396
Hello.

03:59.420 --> 04:00.899
Hi.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.739
Why are you calling me
on my home phone?

04:02.780 --> 04:05.219
Cos you wont pick up your cellphone.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.219
Thats because
I don't want to talk to you.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.299
Please, just give me
another chance. I love you.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.404
Well, I don't love you.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.116
Justin. Please.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.178
I just trimmed those bougainvillea.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.779
Please, Tamara. Ive done
everything youve asked of me.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.339
No, you havent.
Youre still seeing Julia.

04:24.380 --> 04:25.579
No, Im not.

04:25.620 --> 04:27.419
You are such a liar, Justin.

04:27.460 --> 04:30.579
I cant believe I wasted
two years of my life with you.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.859
It wasnt a waste.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.459
We had some good times.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.099
Goodbye, Justin!

04:36.140 --> 04:37.699
What don't you understand?

04:37.740 --> 04:39.684
Its over. Goodbye.

04:41.452 --> 04:43.396
Get out of my house.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.539
Now! OK, all right.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.099
Im going.

04:47.140 --> 04:49.419
Youre going to regret this.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.499
Yeah, well, I seriously doubt that.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.539
Yeah, you understand,
don't you, Sophie?

05:10.020 --> 05:12.659
We need to make some
serious changes around here.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.259
Really?

05:16.300 --> 05:19.659
What do you not understand
about the word over?

05:19.700 --> 05:21.139
Im sorry!

05:21.180 --> 05:23.059
I thought you were someone else.
Can I help you?

05:23.100 --> 05:25.539
Hi, Im William Myers.
Im an estate lawyer.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.419
Yeah, Im not interested
in buying anything.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.339
But thank you.
Miss Sharp, Im sorry.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.739
Im here to talk about an inheritance.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.179
An inheritance?

05:33.220 --> 05:35.859
Yeah, Im sorry, really.
I really don't have the time.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.979
Like I said, Im an estate lawyer.

05:38.020 --> 05:40.339
And Im here to talk about
your fathers estate.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.179
My father?

05:42.220 --> 05:43.459
Well...

05:43.500 --> 05:45.539
I havent talked to him in years.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.259
Not since he left my mother and I
when I was nine years old.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.899
Well, what I have to say to you
will be very important.

05:50.940 --> 05:53.379
My father walked out on us
20 years ago,

05:53.420 --> 05:56.339
so I don't think theres
anything important to discuss.

05:56.380 --> 05:59.619
Unfortunately, your father
passed away last month.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.604
Really?

06:02.020 --> 06:03.179
What happened?

06:03.220 --> 06:07.139
Your father died of a heart attack
while in prison in Nevada.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.099
Well, thats too bad.

06:09.140 --> 06:12.299
I thought maybe he would want
to apologise to me first.

06:12.340 --> 06:15.739
Well, maybe what we have to discuss
is his form of an apology.

06:17.780 --> 06:20.939
While your father was in prison,
he hired me to write a will.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.499
Why would he do that?

06:22.540 --> 06:25.179
Wills are for people who actually
have something to leave behind

06:25.220 --> 06:26.459
when they're gone.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.819
Your father had
some things to leave behind.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.059
He did?

06:30.100 --> 06:31.259
Yes.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.699
Then why didn't he call me?

06:33.740 --> 06:35.739
Why did he ignore me for 20 years?

06:35.780 --> 06:38.139
Do you know how that affects
a little girl?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.739
I understand.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.379
That mustve been a terrible
ordeal for you go through.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.939
And to have your mother suffer too.

06:43.980 --> 06:46.779
It killed her. After he left

06:46.820 --> 06:50.979
she couldnt trust anyone and
we suffered financially for years.

06:51.020 --> 06:54.139
Your fathers indiscretions
cant be ignored.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.139
No, they cant.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.259
And your father understood that.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.499
Right.

06:59.540 --> 07:04.019
But your father wanted to make sure
that everything he had went to you.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.419
I don't want anything of his.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.699
No?

07:07.740 --> 07:11.819
I don't want his watch, his
wedding ring or some old clothes.

07:11.860 --> 07:15.899
I don't want any memories of
a man who destroyed my life.

07:15.940 --> 07:18.499
Miss Sharp, I have no
possessions to give you.

07:18.540 --> 07:21.539
What do you have? Like, some
sappy letters that are supposed to

07:21.580 --> 07:24.699
make me feel better?
An apology on his deathbed?

07:24.740 --> 07:26.859
Yeah, well,
its a little too late for that.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.579
Before your father went to prison

07:28.620 --> 07:31.459
he was an electrical engineer
for a computer company.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.099
While there, your father invented
a small transistor

07:35.140 --> 07:38.579
which is used in cellphones
to track cell towers.

07:38.620 --> 07:43.619
That transistor is in virtually
every cellphone the world.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.939
The company which holds the patent

07:45.980 --> 07:48.739
gave your father
a small percentage of sales.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.579
That small percentage has been
going into a bank account

07:51.620 --> 07:53.459
for the last ten years.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.179
Your fathers will gives you everything.

07:56.220 --> 07:59.099
Well, how much money
are we talking about?

07:59.140 --> 08:04.579
$8.3 million?

08:04.620 --> 08:06.564
Yes.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.819
Your signature of
the acceptance of this money.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.099
What?

08:16.140 --> 08:19.139
By signing this acceptance
of money, its all yours.

08:23.380 --> 08:27.659
The balance has been converted to
your name in the bank account.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.059
Your fathers will gives you everything.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.099
That signature just
solidifies everything.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.379
Well...

08:36.419 --> 08:38.364
Its OK.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.899
Whats the worst that could happen?

08:40.940 --> 08:42.938
Um... Well...

08:42.980 --> 08:44.924
It certainly cant get any worse.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.979
And I promise you, its real.

08:49.020 --> 08:51.379
Welcome to the beginning
of your new life.

08:58.420 --> 09:00.364
OK.

09:01.132 --> 09:03.076
Do I owe you anything?

09:03.100 --> 09:05.579
No, no, no, no. I have my fee.

09:06.452 --> 09:08.396
Were good.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.819
Hold on. Wait.

09:10.860 --> 09:13.099
Promise me this is for real.

09:13.140 --> 09:15.084
It is.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.964
Thank you.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.899
Dont spend it all at once.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.884
No, I... No, I wont.

09:30.580 --> 09:33.419
My God. My God. My God.

10:08.380 --> 10:10.499
Tamara. Whats going on?

10:10.540 --> 10:12.419
My God. Whats going on?

10:12.460 --> 10:15.500
Do you have any idea what kind of traffic
I had to fight through to get here?

10:15.524 --> 10:17.340
Yeah. Why couldnt we just
meet at your house?

10:17.381 --> 10:19.659
Guys, will you just sit?
OK? Just sit. All right.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.644
Sit!

10:23.060 --> 10:25.379
OK.So whats going on?

10:25.420 --> 10:28.099
OK. I dragged you out here
to tell you...

10:29.740 --> 10:33.379
that I bought us
a ten-day trip to Hawaii!

10:33.420 --> 10:35.659
What? You bought it?

10:35.700 --> 10:37.219
Wait. Whats the catch?

10:37.260 --> 10:38.979
There is no catch, Sherry.

10:39.020 --> 10:41.459
I just want to take my two best
friends on a girls trip.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.379
Ive been saving and I can afford it.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.099
Youre going to pay for the entire trip?

10:48.140 --> 10:49.299
The whole thing,

10:49.340 --> 10:51.499
from the limousine to
the airport to the food

10:51.540 --> 10:54.979
to the 5,000 square foot villa
that sits on the water.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.139
No! You cant do this.

10:57.180 --> 10:59.779
Yes, I can. Its the least
I could do for my best...

10:59.820 --> 11:01.579
OK, wait. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.219
How are you affording this? Shh.

11:03.260 --> 11:05.619
Whats the difference?
Cant you just accept a gift?

11:05.660 --> 11:07.339
No, this is our best friend.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.699
What if shes spending
every last penny shes got?

11:09.740 --> 11:11.899
Tamara never does anything on a whim.

11:11.940 --> 11:15.539
Im sure she thought about this
very carefully.

11:15.580 --> 11:19.939
OK, you guys, you remember my...
estranged father?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.939
Yeah. I mean,
you havent talked about him

11:21.980 --> 11:23.779
for a really long time, but, yeah.

11:23.820 --> 11:27.819
He died and left me $8.3 million.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.739
Excuse me? What?

11:29.780 --> 11:31.179
Are you kidding us?

11:31.220 --> 11:34.659
What? Shut up, right now!

11:34.700 --> 11:37.499
I mean, are you OK that he died?
Are you OK that he died?

11:37.540 --> 11:41.339
No, I mean, its weird.
I didn't really know him, you guys.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.419
What? Were going to Hawaii!

11:43.460 --> 11:45.404
Were going to Hawaii!

12:11.380 --> 12:13.324
No way!

12:15.140 --> 12:17.819
My God.

12:17.860 --> 12:20.219
This is beyond decadent.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.339
My God. Somebody pinch me.
Pinch me right now!

12:22.380 --> 12:25.259
Is this for real? I feel like
Im living in a dream.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.779
This is insane.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.099
Aloha, ladies.Hi.

12:29.140 --> 12:31.099
Hi.Welcome to Hawaii.

12:31.140 --> 12:32.899
Thanks. My name is Manny.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.099
Hi, Manny. Daphne will
help you out inside.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.459
I'll get your luggage for you.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.539
OK. Come on. We have
some fun to have!

12:40.940 --> 12:43.739
This is incredible.
God, this is so unbelievable.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.444
My God!

12:55.372 --> 12:57.316
Look, the view is everywhere.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.284
Aloha.

13:00.252 --> 13:02.196
And you must be Tamara.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.499
You must be Daphne.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.979
I am. Welcome to Lanikai Villa.

13:06.020 --> 13:09.299
Youre much prettier than your pictures!

13:09.340 --> 13:11.459
So where are the other guests?

13:11.500 --> 13:13.059
There are no other guests.

13:13.100 --> 13:17.259
Miss Sharp has rented out the whole
villa just for the three of you.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.859
So all of this is ours?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.539
All of this is yours.

13:21.580 --> 13:24.939
My God, we can have some great
parties here. Lets throw it.

13:27.260 --> 13:29.204
Right this way. Thank you.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.179
So right here, we have
our outdoor dining room.

13:37.340 --> 13:40.779
Right over here, we have one
of our outdoor showers.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.139
I love outdoor showers.
Thats great.

13:43.180 --> 13:46.099
And just ahead,
we have our private beach.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.459
Wait, hold on.
Did you say private beach?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.059
I did. Girls!

13:50.100 --> 13:51.739
What? Lets do it!

13:51.780 --> 13:53.724
Woohoo!

14:03.620 --> 14:05.564
Miss Sharp?

14:06.060 --> 14:08.339
I'll bring you some towels.

14:17.692 --> 14:19.636
Woohoo!

14:19.660 --> 14:22.499
Were going in!

14:23.940 --> 14:25.899
Woo!

15:04.732 --> 15:06.676
Youre crazy! What?

15:06.700 --> 15:08.059
My God, hes staring at you.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.779
I think hes taking pictures.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.059
No, hes not. Yes, he is.

15:12.100 --> 15:13.459
Hey, stop!

15:13.500 --> 15:14.819
What?

15:14.860 --> 15:17.859
We havent been here for more than an
hour and already youve got an admirer.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.299
What have you done right in your life?

15:20.340 --> 15:22.740
Yeah, if thats not love at first
sight, I don't know what is.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.579
Will you guys stop it!

15:24.620 --> 15:25.979
Its kind of creepy.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.939
I mean, hes probably some depressed
social outcast sailing the world

15:28.980 --> 15:31.659
because he doesn't want to face
the realities of his life.

15:31.700 --> 15:36.219
Yeah, or hes an Italian supermodel
living the high life with more money

15:36.260 --> 15:38.204
than he knows what to do with.

15:50.820 --> 15:53.779
Manny has already dropped your
luggage off in each of your rooms.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.899
And our chefs preparing a
welcome dinner

15:55.940 --> 15:58.739
for you downstairs on the front deck.

15:58.780 --> 16:02.579
So if theres anything else
that you need, just let us know.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.619
Well, I cant think of anything
better than were getting right now.

16:05.660 --> 16:09.059
Well, were here for you, so don't
hesitate if you think of something.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.580
Dena and Sherry, your rooms are
just down the hall to the right

16:11.604 --> 16:13.899
and, Tamara, your room is just
down the hall to the left.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.419
Thanks so much, Daphne.

16:15.460 --> 16:17.379
See you in a bit.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.364
My gosh.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.139
Its cute.Yeah.
Thats good.Yeah.

16:23.180 --> 16:26.179
Thats good stuff right there.
Lets check this out.

16:27.172 --> 16:29.116
Hey, girls. Yeah?

16:29.140 --> 16:31.699
Lets get dressed, have dinner and

16:31.740 --> 16:34.739
then go out for a night on the town!

16:34.780 --> 16:36.724
Sounds perfect! See you soon! OK.

17:16.652 --> 17:18.596
You had a skiing accident? I did.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.579
Yeah, I did. What happened?

17:20.619 --> 17:23.339
Well, you know. Just fell over.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.924
Right, yeah.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.516
Thats right.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.779
Hey.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.139
Dario, this is our best friend Tamara.

17:39.740 --> 17:42.059
Hello. Buonasera.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.819
Good evening.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.419
Parli Italiano?

17:45.460 --> 17:47.539
No, no. Not really.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.379
Im Dario Pizzinni.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.364
Its nice to meet you.

17:52.060 --> 17:54.259
Im sorry, where did it come from?

17:54.300 --> 17:57.259
He motored over from his boat.

17:59.892 --> 18:01.836
Please, sit down.

18:01.860 --> 18:03.804
Thank you. Youre welcome.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.579
So, I hope you don't mind if
Dario joins us for dinner.

18:07.620 --> 18:11.299
I thought maybe he could
give us some island tips.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.259
No. I mean, yes.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.139
I mean, of course he can
join us for dinner.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.459
Grazie.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.339
Dario is from Italy.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.979
I was born in Venezia.

18:22.020 --> 18:23.859
Venice is incredible.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.819
Its so beautiful. I cant even
imagine growing up there.

18:26.860 --> 18:29.859
Thank you. You know, when you grow
up with so much beautiful things,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.779
you appreciate beauty

18:31.820 --> 18:34.139
in a whole different level, you know?

18:38.460 --> 18:41.499
So, what brings you to Hawaii?

18:41.540 --> 18:43.899
Well, young lady, its the boat.

18:43.940 --> 18:47.459
My yacht. We rent it to some of the
guests at the villa several times

18:47.500 --> 18:50.819
a year and we have a little
arrangement with Daphne, you know?

18:50.860 --> 18:53.179
What do you do the other
nine months of the year?

18:53.220 --> 18:54.259
Well, Tamara,

18:54.300 --> 18:58.139
I have a business in marbles from
Milano and I import and export it.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.179
So I travel and go back and forth.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.619
You married? No, no.

19:03.660 --> 19:07.179
I was married but I was looking
for the perfect woman.

19:07.932 --> 19:09.876
The woman is not difficult.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.219
I am difficult because
I travel and I go and

19:13.260 --> 19:15.204
I fish all over the place...

19:16.220 --> 19:18.860
And they're around me all the way
to the bottom, and then I make it

19:18.900 --> 19:21.939
and Im going all the way back to the boat.
Im swimming as fast as I can.

19:21.980 --> 19:24.299
I caught my breath, I look behind,
the shark is gone.

19:24.340 --> 19:25.859
Poof, like that!

19:25.900 --> 19:27.419
Thats incredible.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.779
I cant believe you fought off a
shark by yourself underwater.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.339
Its no big deal.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.019
You would have done the same thing, no?

19:34.060 --> 19:36.419
Er, no. I would have
rolled over and died.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.979
Yeah, me too. I would be
dead right now.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.459
What about you?
What would you have done?

19:42.820 --> 19:44.764
I would have fought for my life.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.739
Well, it is getting late.

19:53.780 --> 19:55.539
Maybe its time we head on up.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.059
Right, Dena? No, Im good.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.579
I can stay up. Right, Dina?

19:58.620 --> 20:00.659
Right. Um...

20:00.700 --> 20:02.499
OK.Im really tired.Yeah.

20:02.540 --> 20:04.859
Maybe they're right.
No, youre good.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.699
Youre good. Dario, pleasure.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.619
The pleasure is all mine.
Buonasera.

20:08.660 --> 20:10.860
Maybe we see you tomorrow?
Maybe for a ride on the boat.

20:10.884 --> 20:12.499
Definitely.OK.
All right, Good night.

20:12.540 --> 20:15.459
Good night. Good night.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.579
Im so sorry about my friends.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.339
Theyre not obvious, are they?

20:19.380 --> 20:21.619
Please, don't apologise for them.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.604
Theyre sweet.

20:24.172 --> 20:26.116
But you,

20:26.140 --> 20:28.219
youre more than sweet.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.259
You are something...

20:30.300 --> 20:32.244
How should I say?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.476
Alluring.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.444
I am?

20:36.852 --> 20:38.796
Yes.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.764
Your friends are girls.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.444
You are a woman.

20:45.572 --> 20:47.516
Let me show you the moonlight.

20:47.540 --> 20:48.579
OK.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.179
How did you know the moon was out?

20:50.220 --> 20:53.139
In Italy, we call it Luna.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.419
Bella Luna! Bella Luna.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.404
Very beautiful.

20:57.652 --> 20:59.596
So bright.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.619
Can you navigate by the stars?

21:01.660 --> 21:03.099
Yeah. Really?

21:03.140 --> 21:04.739
I navigate by love.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.899
Have you heard of that before?

21:06.940 --> 21:10.019
No, Ive never heard that before.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.779
Youre beautiful.
YOURE beautiful.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.099
Balance, balance.
Dont lose your balance.

21:30.140 --> 21:32.739
Theres so many stairs!

21:32.780 --> 21:35.619
So many stairs. Why don't
we stay downstairs?

21:35.660 --> 21:37.459
Dont wake them.Shh.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.859
Come this way. I know where
Im going. I know where Im going.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.539
Shh! That way.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.979
Sherrys room.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.964
Im sorry. Shh!

22:09.892 --> 22:11.836
What? Whats wrong?

22:11.860 --> 22:13.804
You look like youre going to cry.

22:15.180 --> 22:18.459
I havent been this happy
in a really long time.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.444
Me too.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.484
Dario!

22:33.252 --> 22:35.196
Thank you for a beautiful night.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.979
Sadly, I have to work,
but I will be back for you later.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.964
Arrivederci.

22:56.380 --> 22:58.324
Ciao!

23:23.894 --> 23:26.213
I think... Wait. Maybe it
was... Was it that guy

23:26.254 --> 23:28.293
on that boat? Who? That creep?

23:28.334 --> 23:31.733
Hi. Hello. Hi! Hello.
Look who it is.

23:31.774 --> 23:33.213
Hey.

23:33.254 --> 23:34.893
So, give us the scoop.

23:34.934 --> 23:36.573
We want details.Yeah.

23:36.614 --> 23:37.813
And we mean everything.

23:37.854 --> 23:40.413
Not the vanilla scoop, I want
the nuts, the fudge,

23:40.454 --> 23:42.213
the cherry. OK, Sherry. Really?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.213
Im just keeping it real, man.

23:44.254 --> 23:47.333
All Im going to say
is that it was magical.

23:51.014 --> 23:52.958
BOTH: Magical?

23:53.814 --> 23:56.453
Wait, wait. Come back here.
Come back here. Come back here.

23:56.494 --> 23:58.733
Magical? No.

23:58.774 --> 24:00.933
My first kiss with Brian Finley
was magical,

24:00.974 --> 24:02.974
and all he did was stick
his tongue down my throat.

24:02.998 --> 24:05.453
Ew! We are all adults here
and we need details.

24:05.494 --> 24:07.573
Yeah. You know, I bet
you wimped out.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.333
She probably didn't even kiss him.

24:09.374 --> 24:12.093
OK, reverse psychology is
not going to work on me.

24:12.134 --> 24:16.493
Fine! Just tell me,
have you taken a lover?

24:17.606 --> 24:19.550
My God. My God!
Totally slept with him.

24:19.574 --> 24:21.093
She did! Was he good in bed?

24:21.134 --> 24:24.293
All right, I did. I didn't sleep
with him, sleep with him, OK?

24:24.334 --> 24:27.013
We kissed, we talked, we cuddled.

24:27.054 --> 24:29.453
Boring! No! Cuddling is sweet.

24:29.494 --> 24:30.813
I wish guys would cuddle with me.

24:30.854 --> 24:32.853
All they want to do when
they meet me is...

24:32.894 --> 24:34.093
Hi, ladies.Hi.

24:34.134 --> 24:36.895
I just came to check on you, see
theres anything I can get you at all.

24:36.919 --> 24:39.013
Well, you can get me a cold shower!

24:39.054 --> 24:40.293
Everything has been perfect.

24:40.334 --> 24:41.973
Thanks, Daphne.OK.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.814
Well, youve got my number, so if you
think of anything at all you need,

24:44.838 --> 24:46.373
you let me know. Thank you.

24:46.414 --> 24:47.773
She is so sweet.

24:47.814 --> 24:49.613
She is. And its so amazing here.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.013
Anyway. Anyway!

24:51.054 --> 24:54.853
Were supposed to hook up tonight, but, I mean,
that wouldnt be right cos Im here with you guys.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.333
And I didn't drag you all the
way across the ocean to, like,

24:57.374 --> 24:59.773
spend time with some stranger, so...

24:59.814 --> 25:01.893
Yeah. You know, Im going to
be honest with you.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.533
If I had been with a hot
Italian guy last night,

25:04.574 --> 25:06.333
I would not be with the
two of you right now.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.693
Yeah, Im with Sherry on this one.

25:07.734 --> 25:10.533
You need to spend every second you
can with this Italian stallion,

25:10.574 --> 25:12.893
because when is this ever
going to happen again?

25:12.934 --> 25:14.293
Shes right. Shes right.

25:14.334 --> 25:16.773
Were in paradise. And you can
see us any time,

25:16.814 --> 25:20.613
but youve got this opportunity
to rub up against

25:20.654 --> 25:22.213
this gorgeous Italian man -

25:22.254 --> 25:23.893
you should take it right now.

25:23.934 --> 25:28.013
Look-ee there. There he is now.

25:28.054 --> 25:30.533
Well, look at that.
Isnt that convenient?

25:30.574 --> 25:32.293
Are you sure youll be OK?

25:32.334 --> 25:35.093
Yes. If I was by myself
I might be sad, but Ive got Dena.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.253
And Ive got Sherry. And were fine.

25:37.294 --> 25:38.493
Go have fun.

25:38.534 --> 25:42.293
Yes, and just make sure you tell us everything,
so that we can live vicariously through you.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.853
Are you sure?

25:43.894 --> 25:45.573
BOTH: Yes! OK, OK!

25:45.614 --> 25:47.653
I believe you. Now, don't be mad.

25:47.694 --> 25:49.533
Wed be mad if you didn't go.

25:49.574 --> 25:50.933
OK, love you, guys.

25:50.974 --> 25:53.293
Thanks for being the best
friends in the whole world.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.693
You know shes lying, right?

25:54.734 --> 25:57.973
She totally slept with him.
She totally had sex with them.

26:02.814 --> 26:04.933
Hey! Hi.

26:04.974 --> 26:06.653
How are you?

26:06.694 --> 26:08.013
Youre back already?

26:08.054 --> 26:10.133
Well, Im back because one of
the guests on the boat

26:10.174 --> 26:13.053
got sick, so short day for me.

26:13.094 --> 26:15.173
Well, I have a great idea.

26:15.214 --> 26:16.373
I want to show you

26:16.414 --> 26:19.813
the most fantastic, beautiful
place - bellissimo - on the island.

26:19.854 --> 26:20.893
For you.

26:20.934 --> 26:23.373
Really? Would I lie to you?

26:24.566 --> 26:26.510
Come on, lets go.

26:26.534 --> 26:29.093
MUSIC: Stay With Me
by Brandon Jarrett.

27:49.574 --> 27:52.133
So beautiful.

27:52.174 --> 27:54.413
Youre beautiful.

27:54.454 --> 27:56.398
So are you.

27:57.254 --> 27:59.198
Please, stay with me.

28:00.206 --> 28:02.150
I cant.

28:02.174 --> 28:04.118
Why not?

28:05.814 --> 28:08.573
Because Im afraid. Afraid of what?

28:08.614 --> 28:11.093
Im afraid this wont last.

28:11.134 --> 28:13.253
Why wouldnt it last?

28:13.294 --> 28:14.853
Because I don't know you.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.573
But you know whats in my heart.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.453
Thats not enough.

28:19.494 --> 28:21.853
Its the heart thats hurt
me so much in the past.

28:21.894 --> 28:24.573
But we will get to know each other.

28:24.614 --> 28:27.253
We will learn about one another, no?

28:27.294 --> 28:30.573
Its not real. You cant
meet someone on a tropical island

28:30.614 --> 28:33.613
and expect it to last. Why not?

28:33.654 --> 28:35.598
Because thats a fantasy.

28:36.694 --> 28:39.133
What? What?
Well, maybe youre right.

28:39.174 --> 28:41.118
Maybe...

28:42.334 --> 28:44.533
were not right for each other?

28:44.574 --> 28:46.693
What is that supposed to mean?

28:46.734 --> 28:48.678
Youre so negative.

28:49.014 --> 28:51.173
Youre not the person
that I hoped youd be.

28:53.334 --> 28:55.278
Maybe youre right.

28:56.214 --> 28:58.573
Who did this to you?
Tell me why youre so hurt.

28:58.614 --> 29:01.813
OK. Well, it started with my father.

29:01.854 --> 29:04.733
And then it was
every single guy after that.

29:04.774 --> 29:06.718
Ive been through a lot.

29:08.054 --> 29:10.373
Dario, Im damaged goods,

29:10.414 --> 29:14.333
and I don't want to bring
my baggage into your beautiful life.

29:14.374 --> 29:16.133
Hey, its a beautiful life, yes.

29:16.174 --> 29:18.813
It doesn't mean I havent
had bad times, too.

29:20.574 --> 29:24.093
Ive been searching for the silver
lining between the clouds.

29:24.134 --> 29:26.933
Thats why I sail around the world,
looking for it.

29:28.014 --> 29:30.293
And now Ive found it in you.

29:30.334 --> 29:32.653
And you have to believe in love.

29:32.694 --> 29:34.373
Every time Ive believed in love

29:34.414 --> 29:37.533
its blown up in my face and then
Im left with nothing.

29:37.574 --> 29:43.533
You know why writers
and poets and painters

29:43.574 --> 29:47.053
all have something to
do with love, you know why?

29:47.094 --> 29:50.013
Why? Because love is real.

29:50.054 --> 29:51.693
It is tangible.

29:51.734 --> 29:52.853
And we have it.

29:52.894 --> 29:54.838
Me and you.

29:55.414 --> 29:57.358
Please, don't run away.

29:58.054 --> 29:59.998
Dont run away.

30:23.334 --> 30:25.853
Give me your word - youre just
going to get your clothes

30:25.894 --> 30:30.013
and come right back. I promise.
OK. Good.

30:30.054 --> 30:32.573
Thank you.

30:32.614 --> 30:34.558
Thank me, for what?

30:35.134 --> 30:37.413
For yesterday. For last night.

30:37.454 --> 30:38.573
For you.

30:38.614 --> 30:44.093
No, you don't have to thank me,
OK? Were the dynamic duo.

30:44.134 --> 30:47.253
Robin never had to thank Batman,
right? Right.

30:47.294 --> 30:50.573
So, not necessary to thank me. OK?

31:28.446 --> 31:30.390
Tamara!
My God, where have you been?

31:30.414 --> 31:33.653
With Dario. Why, whats going on?
Its Dena, shes terribly hurt.

31:33.694 --> 31:35.853
What? Come on, come on.
My God!

31:40.534 --> 31:43.573
My God! My God!

31:43.614 --> 31:47.973
My God! What happened?
What happened?

31:48.014 --> 31:51.533
Somebody found her on
the beach this morning.

31:51.574 --> 31:53.813
Penny thinks that she was beat up.

31:53.854 --> 31:56.773
Nothing like this has ever, ever
happened here before.

31:56.814 --> 31:59.293
Sweetie!!

31:59.334 --> 32:02.293
Is she going to be OK?

32:02.334 --> 32:03.613
We have to get packed up.

32:03.654 --> 32:06.653
The medics have to get her
to the hospital right away.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.253
Who is it? Its Dario.

32:24.294 --> 32:27.693
What are you doing?

32:27.734 --> 32:30.253
Its Dena.

32:30.294 --> 32:33.853
She was almost killed last night.

32:33.894 --> 32:35.933
Really, what happened?

32:35.974 --> 32:37.613
They said she was raped.

32:37.654 --> 32:41.693
No, no, thats not possible. Here?
That stuff never happened in years.

32:41.734 --> 32:44.493
Well, it did. Wait, wait, wait, wait
a second, what are you gonna do?

32:44.534 --> 32:47.173
Im going to the hospital.
Thats fine, Ill go with you.

32:47.214 --> 32:51.133
No, no, you cant. I want to help!
No, please, don't.

32:51.174 --> 32:52.613
Tell me whats going on.

32:52.654 --> 32:55.213
What are you doing? Its my fault.

32:55.254 --> 32:58.133
I never should have brought her here.

32:58.174 --> 33:00.053
Tamara, thats ridiculous.

33:00.094 --> 33:02.733
I mean, how could you have known
something so bad could happen?

33:02.774 --> 33:05.613
OK, maybe, maybe I couldnt have
known that it was going to happen,

33:05.654 --> 33:08.813
but it did, and I feel responsible.

33:08.854 --> 33:12.093
I cant explain it. But maybe if
I had been with Sherry and Dena

33:12.134 --> 33:15.013
instead of you,
I could have done something.

33:15.054 --> 33:16.333
Come on.

33:16.374 --> 33:21.373
Wait, wait, wait! Tamara, please.
Youre gonna leave like that?

33:21.414 --> 33:24.973
Dario, we were living a fantasy.

33:25.014 --> 33:27.653
But now Dena is living a reality.

33:27.694 --> 33:28.893
That is, if she lives.

33:28.934 --> 33:30.933
Im sorry. Tamara, please.

33:30.974 --> 33:32.693
Tamara, don't go.

33:32.734 --> 33:35.133
Come on! Talk to me, please.

33:37.374 --> 33:45.053
Tamara.

33:48.534 --> 33:51.053
Please promise me youll be back.

33:51.094 --> 33:53.053
I cant promise.

33:53.094 --> 33:56.013
But if were supposed to be
together, itll happen.

34:17.734 --> 34:20.172
My God.

34:20.214 --> 34:22.158
Dena! Dena!

34:25.293 --> 34:28.053
Dena! Dena! My God.

34:31.974 --> 34:35.253
This is all my fault. My God.

34:35.293 --> 34:38.172
I never should have left her alone.
I shouldve stayed with her.

34:38.214 --> 34:41.132
This is not your fault.
Someone evil did that to her.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.693
My God.

34:49.054 --> 34:52.453
Life is going to be
so different without her.

34:52.494 --> 34:53.893
We were like the Three Musketeers.

34:53.934 --> 34:57.653
What are we going to do now?

34:57.694 --> 35:00.053
Were going to stay strong.

35:00.094 --> 35:06.693
OK? For Dena. Shes gonna live.
Shes gonna live.

35:30.654 --> 35:32.973
So, are you ever going to
see Dario again?

35:33.014 --> 35:34.013
No, its too early.

35:34.054 --> 35:36.973
I was waiting for Dena
to come out of her coma.

35:37.014 --> 35:39.813
Have you talked to him?
I don't even have his number.

35:41.174 --> 35:43.853
Well, have you checked with
Manny or Daphne. They must have it.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.253
I tried. They said he
doesn't have a phone.

35:47.294 --> 35:50.133
Thats weird. How does he
book trips with clients?

35:54.414 --> 35:56.573
Do you think Im doing the right thing?

35:56.614 --> 35:58.693
Im really gonna miss this place.

35:58.734 --> 36:02.093
My God, Tammy, you just bought
your dream house. Enjoy that.

36:02.134 --> 36:04.653
Dont look back. Come on.
Life is too short.

36:04.694 --> 36:07.293
Yeah, but what if
this money was a curse?

36:07.334 --> 36:09.053
What if Im not supposed to be rich?

36:09.094 --> 36:10.653
Dont say that.

36:10.694 --> 36:12.773
Come here. Come on.

36:12.814 --> 36:15.253
My God, its going to be fantastic.
Thank you.

36:41.494 --> 36:44.453
My dearest Tamara.
I miss you sincerely.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.813
You touched my heart
when we were together

36:46.854 --> 36:49.853
and you broke my heart when you left.

36:49.894 --> 36:53.653
Please, come back to me and
continue our adventure together.

36:54.774 --> 36:56.718
I love you. Dario.

37:20.254 --> 37:22.453
It was this big and this wide.

37:24.054 --> 37:26.013
Hang on one second.

37:28.454 --> 37:33.253
Hey, Tamara. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas. Come in.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.573
Its fine. My God.

37:35.614 --> 37:37.533
I hope I didn't break my present.

37:37.574 --> 37:39.973
I knew I shouldn't have
carried them all in.

37:40.014 --> 37:42.173
Well, you didn't have to
bring anything, you know.

37:42.214 --> 37:44.973
Yes, I did. I have a present
for almost everybody.

37:45.014 --> 37:46.253
You didn't have to do that.

37:46.294 --> 37:48.973
Sherry, please. Im rich, remember.

37:49.014 --> 37:52.213
Yeah, I do remember.
Hi, everyone.

37:52.254 --> 37:54.198
ALL: Hi.

37:54.574 --> 37:56.133
I actually cant stay long.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.053
Why, whats going on?

37:58.094 --> 38:01.973
I'll tell you but Im gonna
have to give you a gift first.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.893
Thanks. You know, actually,
actually, don't open it yet.

38:04.934 --> 38:10.893
OK.First, I want to let you know
that Im heading back to Hawaii...

38:10.934 --> 38:12.933
to see Dario. You are?

38:12.974 --> 38:17.373
Yeah. I mean, I decided that I cant
deny myself happiness any more.

38:17.414 --> 38:19.373
We have to live our lives
to the fullest

38:19.414 --> 38:21.253
and, after what happened to Dena,

38:21.294 --> 38:24.733
I realised that that could happen
to any of us at any time.

38:24.774 --> 38:27.573
Yeah. So, Im going.

38:27.614 --> 38:30.933
I mean, I don't know if well
still have the same chemistry,

38:30.974 --> 38:33.013
but at least Ill know that I tried.

38:33.054 --> 38:34.853
My God, that is so wonderful.

38:34.894 --> 38:36.853
Tam, Im so happy for you.

38:36.894 --> 38:39.893
And part of my happiness is your gift.

38:41.774 --> 38:43.733
Open it.OK.

38:51.814 --> 38:54.133
Are you kidding me?
Youre really doing this?

38:54.174 --> 38:56.453
My God, I love you so much.

38:56.494 --> 39:02.213
Dena and you are my family.
I love you, too.

39:02.254 --> 39:04.853
My God. I love you, too.

39:04.894 --> 39:06.613
Everybody,

39:06.654 --> 39:09.053
shes paying off my mortgage!

39:11.814 --> 39:16.173
Stop. My God.
Stop. My God, thank you!

39:16.214 --> 39:18.533
Now presents. My God.

39:35.294 --> 39:37.813
Hey, bella bambina!

39:37.854 --> 39:39.798
Hey!

39:41.454 --> 39:46.133
I missed you.
I missed you, too. Give me that bag.

39:46.174 --> 39:48.493
Jump in. Lets go home.

39:49.774 --> 39:51.718
Come on.OK.

41:06.054 --> 41:29.213
Dario!

41:29.254 --> 41:31.198
Hey, honey. Im up here. Come up.

41:36.534 --> 41:38.478
Hi!

41:41.454 --> 41:43.693
Are we coming in?
Were heading back to the port

41:43.734 --> 41:46.213
cos I have to get back to work.
I have some clients.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.333
You have clients.

41:48.374 --> 41:50.053
I didn't tell you last night?

41:50.094 --> 41:51.853
Well, I don't remember.

41:51.894 --> 41:55.253
Yeah, well, I have some
insurance people.

41:55.294 --> 41:56.693
A company, they rented the boat.

41:56.734 --> 41:58.573
You know,
they want to go deep sea fishing.

41:58.614 --> 42:00.533
Well, that sounds fun.

42:00.574 --> 42:04.413
Can I help? I mean, maybe I can be
your assistant or your first mate

42:04.454 --> 42:05.853
or your best mate.

42:05.894 --> 42:08.013
You already are my best mate.

42:08.054 --> 42:10.373
But you probably don't want
to come on this trip

42:10.414 --> 42:15.613
because these people
are very, lets say, rowdy.

42:15.654 --> 42:19.693
But you should go to the hotel,
relax, get a massage.

42:21.086 --> 42:23.030
Yeah. Yeah, maybe youre right.

42:23.054 --> 42:25.733
I mean, I have a lot of
phone calls to make.

42:25.774 --> 42:28.013
I especially want to call Dena.

42:28.054 --> 42:29.773
Dena. Thats right.

42:29.814 --> 42:32.413
How is she doing? Not well.

42:32.454 --> 42:34.173
Shes still in a coma.

42:34.214 --> 42:36.853
The doctors said there
are some positive signs, so...

42:36.894 --> 42:38.133
Thats good.

42:38.174 --> 42:41.013
OK, well, I hope she gets better, OK?

42:41.054 --> 42:42.998
All right? Sorry.

43:02.616 --> 43:04.615
Hey, honey. Hi, honey. How are you?

43:04.656 --> 43:07.575
Well, Im a little bit wet
right now but Im doing good.

43:07.616 --> 43:08.655
How are you?

43:08.696 --> 43:12.055
I am actually amazing.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.535
So you and Dario are an item again?

43:15.576 --> 43:17.815
Were more than an item.

43:17.856 --> 43:19.335
My God!

43:19.376 --> 43:21.320
Have you used the L word yet?

43:21.728 --> 43:23.672
Tamara?

43:23.696 --> 43:25.975
I cant help it. It just comes out.

43:26.016 --> 43:27.815
My God!

43:27.856 --> 43:31.375
Youre never coming home.
Im going to lose my best friend.

43:31.416 --> 43:34.655
Dont say that. Im coming home.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.815
Well just split our time
between San Francisco

43:36.856 --> 43:38.175
and the rest of the world.

43:38.216 --> 43:40.255
Well, that only sounds amazing.

43:41.936 --> 43:44.655
Hows Dena?
Well, shes doing better.

43:44.696 --> 43:46.855
She actually squeezed
her moms hand last night.

43:46.896 --> 43:48.335
Really?

43:48.376 --> 43:50.855
The doctor thinks shes slowly
coming out of the coma.

43:50.896 --> 43:52.495
How about the brain damage?

43:52.536 --> 43:53.935
Well, the tests look good

43:53.976 --> 43:57.455
but they're not going to know
until she wakes up, you know.

43:57.496 --> 43:59.735
I pray for her every night.

43:59.776 --> 44:01.720
So do I.

44:01.936 --> 44:04.295
Hey, Tamara. Will you please
be careful out there?

44:04.336 --> 44:06.695
They never caught the guy
who did that, you know.

44:06.736 --> 44:08.615
Dont worry about me. I'll be fine.

44:08.656 --> 44:11.695
Yeah, well, just please be careful.
I couldnt stand it if

44:11.736 --> 44:14.935
something else happened to my
other best friend, OK? OK.

44:14.976 --> 44:18.775
All right. Well, listen, sweetie,
Im so late, Ive got to go, OK?

44:18.816 --> 44:20.615
But Ill talk to you soon.OK.

44:20.656 --> 44:23.135
I'll call you later.
OK, honey. Bye.Bye.

44:43.536 --> 44:47.375
Hey, have you heard from Dario?

44:47.416 --> 44:49.255
He was supposed to be back hours ago.

44:49.296 --> 44:50.575
No, I havent heard from him.

44:50.616 --> 44:52.775
Should I worry if hes not back by dark?

44:52.816 --> 44:54.255
Dont worry. Im sure hes fine.

44:54.296 --> 44:57.175
When this happens, it usually
means hes out with clients.

44:57.216 --> 45:00.055
Honestly, Dario is
a very seasoned sailor.

45:00.096 --> 45:02.455
Besides, he has all the right
emergency equipment.

45:02.496 --> 45:04.135
I wouldnt worry, Miss Sharp.

45:04.176 --> 45:08.015
Well, Im going to worry
a little bit. I cant help myself.

45:08.056 --> 45:10.000
Thanks.

45:25.856 --> 45:29.615
Miss Sharp? Dario?

45:29.656 --> 45:33.095
No, Im sorry. I just wanted to let
you know that Im going to go home.

45:33.136 --> 45:35.535
But I brought you this towel.

45:35.576 --> 45:37.855
Thank you.

45:37.896 --> 45:40.615
What time is it?
Its about a quarter after nine.

45:42.056 --> 45:45.695
Did Dario come back?
I still havent seen him.

45:45.736 --> 45:47.215
Well, what about his clients?

45:47.256 --> 45:49.415
Well, his clients are
from another company,

45:49.456 --> 45:51.495
so I wouldnt have seen them either.

45:51.536 --> 45:55.375
I thought Dario only worked
with your charter company.

45:55.416 --> 45:59.015
No, the yacht boys work with whoever
their owners want them to work with.

46:00.336 --> 46:02.280
Im sorry, owners? Yeah.

46:03.576 --> 46:07.775
Wait a minute. You didn't think that
Dario owns the yacht, did you?

46:07.816 --> 46:09.415
No, Miss Sharp.

46:09.456 --> 46:11.455
Those yachts cost millions of dollars

46:11.496 --> 46:14.015
and Dario strictly captains the ship.

46:14.056 --> 46:15.415
Personally, I don't even think

46:15.456 --> 46:17.400
he can afford to eat
here at this hotel.

46:17.968 --> 46:19.912
Really?

46:19.936 --> 46:23.615
Im sorry, Miss Sharp. Its
getting late. I really should go.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.215
But maybe reservations
can hold a room for you.

46:26.256 --> 46:29.415
Unfortunately, they're all booked
up. I already checked.

46:29.456 --> 46:31.400
I wish I could help you.

46:55.576 --> 46:58.975
We rent it to some of
the guests at the villa.

47:05.536 --> 47:08.815
DISTORTED: I wanted to show you the
most beautiful place on the island.

47:08.856 --> 47:11.175
Dario!

47:11.216 --> 47:12.655
Bella bambina!

47:12.696 --> 47:14.015
The company they rented the boat,

47:14.056 --> 47:15.935
you know, they want to go
deep sea fishing.

47:15.976 --> 47:18.535
DISTORTED: Beautiful place
on the island.

47:46.696 --> 47:49.935
Miss Sharp? Miss Sharp?

47:49.976 --> 47:53.175
Dario? No, Im sorry.
I still havent seen him.

47:53.216 --> 47:54.815
But I do have some good news for you.

47:54.856 --> 47:56.735
You do?
Reception is holding a room for you

47:56.776 --> 47:59.455
and its yours if youd like it.
Thatd be great.

47:59.496 --> 48:02.695
Yeah? Theyre waiting
for you right now.

48:02.736 --> 48:04.680
Thank you so much.

48:10.456 --> 48:12.935
Hi.Aloha.
Welcome to Paradise Bay resort.

48:12.976 --> 48:14.535
Hi, Im Tamara Sharp.

48:14.576 --> 48:17.295
I think you have a room for me.
Yes, Miss Sharp.

48:17.336 --> 48:19.280
I'll just need a credit card.

48:22.656 --> 48:24.600
Thank you.

48:30.688 --> 48:32.632
It says that this card is declined.

48:32.656 --> 48:35.455
Its not possible.
Ive never even used this card.

48:35.496 --> 48:37.440
Do you have another one, maybe?

48:39.176 --> 48:41.120
Thank you.

48:45.408 --> 48:47.352
This one is also declined.

48:47.376 --> 48:49.320
What? That cant be.

48:50.416 --> 48:52.360
OK, try that one.

48:57.248 --> 48:59.192
Declined?

48:59.216 --> 49:00.695
Yes. Im sorry.

49:00.736 --> 49:01.975
I don't know whats going on.

49:02.016 --> 49:03.935
Please, please, I really need a room.

49:03.976 --> 49:05.615
I promise Im good for it.

49:05.656 --> 49:11.095
Please!
I'll tell you what, why don't you

49:11.136 --> 49:14.255
take this room until
the 3pm checkout time

49:14.296 --> 49:17.095
and then come back to me once you
figure everything out.

49:17.136 --> 49:18.495
Thank you. Thank you so much.

49:18.536 --> 49:21.415
Please don't tell anybody
I did this. I can lose my job.

49:21.456 --> 49:23.895
I promise. Its right down
the hall to your left.

49:23.936 --> 49:26.615
I wont tell anybody. Thank you.
Have a great day.

49:36.696 --> 49:39.495
What is going on?!

49:50.256 --> 49:58.015
Dario!

50:04.416 --> 50:06.360
Where can you be?

50:26.456 --> 50:28.400
Wait! What?

50:28.768 --> 50:30.712
Wh...

50:30.736 --> 50:32.255
My God!

50:32.296 --> 50:34.240
Where is my money?

50:37.128 --> 50:39.072
Hello?

50:39.096 --> 50:41.175
Thank you for calling West Coast Bank.

50:41.216 --> 50:43.855
Unfortunately, youve
dialled us after hours.

50:43.896 --> 50:46.535
Please call us back
during business hours.

50:59.856 --> 51:02.335
Hello? Miss Sharp,
turn on your television.

51:02.376 --> 51:04.695
You might want to see
whats on the news.

51:10.736 --> 51:14.975
Well, thank you, Carl. Weve been
following this story all morning.

51:15.016 --> 51:17.255
The yacht, the Lucky Lady,

51:17.296 --> 51:20.495
was found floating about
ten miles south-west of Hawaii.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.615
The coastguard found the yacht
early this morning

51:22.656 --> 51:24.695
but there were no people on board.

51:24.736 --> 51:27.415
A hurricane-force gale whipped
through the area last night.

51:27.456 --> 51:30.215
My God! It might have caused
the occupants to vacate the vessel

51:30.256 --> 51:32.200
or fall overboard.

51:35.656 --> 51:39.335
Yeah. His name is Dario Pizzinni.

51:39.376 --> 51:40.975
Theres no record of a Dario Pizzinni

51:41.016 --> 51:43.735
coming in or out of
the Hawaiian Islands.

51:43.776 --> 51:45.455
Well, do you track everyone?

51:45.496 --> 51:48.575
Well, they're supposed to report in
to customs to pay their fees.

51:48.616 --> 51:52.455
Unfortunately, we cant guard
the entire Pacific Ocean.

51:52.496 --> 51:54.535
How about his yacht, the Lucky Lady?

51:56.536 --> 52:00.575
Its owned by
an investment banking company

52:00.616 --> 52:02.935
and it was reported stolen a year ago.

52:05.856 --> 52:09.095
OK. Well, thank you for your help.

52:09.136 --> 52:11.575
Please just let me know
if you hear anything.

52:11.616 --> 52:13.455
Youll be one of the first I call.

52:13.496 --> 52:16.095
We have your contact information.

52:16.136 --> 52:18.080
Thank you.

52:34.856 --> 52:36.800
Im checking out.

52:37.456 --> 52:39.815
Im so sorry for your loss, by the way.

52:39.856 --> 52:41.695
Dario or my money?

52:41.736 --> 52:43.680
Both.

52:44.936 --> 52:48.495
Is it true that this happens
to women here often?

52:48.536 --> 52:51.295
Not that often but it does happen.

52:51.336 --> 52:54.135
Last year, a woman died
scuba-diving.

52:54.176 --> 52:57.215
Turns out someone turned off
her oxygen 50 feet underwater.

52:57.256 --> 53:00.775
My God.
She was single and very wealthy.

53:00.816 --> 53:02.535
Same recipe for disaster.

53:02.576 --> 53:05.135
But why doesn't anyone
do anything about it?

53:05.176 --> 53:08.455
What can we do?
People come here for the fantasy.

53:08.496 --> 53:11.975
But sometimes, the fantasy isnt
all that its cracked up to be.

53:12.016 --> 53:14.135
Ive got to go. Thank you.

53:20.656 --> 53:22.775
So nice to be back home.

53:22.816 --> 53:25.135
Im so glad to have my best friend back.

53:25.176 --> 53:27.735
Thank you for being there for me.

53:27.776 --> 53:29.935
Im going to go see Dena
tomorrow. You want to come?

53:29.976 --> 53:31.920
Definitely.

53:37.216 --> 53:40.535
Well, thank God I bought
the house with cash.

53:43.096 --> 53:45.095
Any word on getting your money back?

53:45.808 --> 53:47.752
The credit card companies

53:47.776 --> 53:49.775
will reimburse me
for the credit card charges

53:49.816 --> 53:54.175
but the FDIC will only insure
my bank account for 250,000.

53:55.296 --> 53:57.855
The rest of the millions are gone.

53:57.896 --> 53:59.935
Not unless we catch
the son of a bitch who took it.

54:01.496 --> 54:03.440
Do you think it was Dario?

54:05.896 --> 54:07.840
I don't know what to think.

54:17.976 --> 54:20.455
Hey, Mr and Mrs Hobbs.
Whats going on?

54:20.496 --> 54:22.735
Shes awake. Denas out of her coma.

54:22.776 --> 54:25.935
My God!
How is she? Well, shes exhausted,

54:25.976 --> 54:28.455
but shes communicating and the
doctors say that shes going to

54:28.496 --> 54:30.855
need some therapy but shes going
to be all right.

54:30.896 --> 54:31.935
Thats amazing.

54:31.976 --> 54:34.456
She wants to talk to you girls.
Shes waiting for you right now.

54:34.480 --> 54:36.935
All right. OK.

54:36.976 --> 54:38.920
Dena!

54:39.296 --> 54:41.695
My God, weve missed you so much.

54:41.736 --> 54:44.335
Thank you for being here for me.

54:44.376 --> 54:47.535
We love you.
Youre our third sister.

54:47.576 --> 54:50.495
I don't know what we
would have done if you...

54:50.536 --> 54:52.615
Well, I didn't.

54:52.656 --> 54:54.095
Im here.

54:54.136 --> 54:56.935
I made it.
Youre so strong, sweetie.

54:56.976 --> 54:58.895
I knew you would.

54:58.936 --> 55:02.335
I knew that because I heard
everything that was said.

55:04.608 --> 55:06.552
Its very strange.

55:06.576 --> 55:08.295
Its like...

55:08.336 --> 55:11.295
being asleep and...

55:11.336 --> 55:13.975
not being able to wake up,
no matter how hard you try.

55:17.208 --> 55:19.152
I remember what happened.

55:19.176 --> 55:21.655
No. No, sweetie.
You don't have to talk about that.

55:21.696 --> 55:24.775
I have to tell you. No, sweetie.
You don't have to relive it.

55:24.816 --> 55:27.055
Yes, I do.

55:29.256 --> 55:31.200
Its important.

55:33.296 --> 55:37.335
It was the night we finished dinner

55:37.376 --> 55:40.015
and I went back to my room to rest.

55:40.056 --> 55:42.000
Tamara?

55:43.296 --> 55:45.240
Sherry?

55:45.856 --> 55:47.800
You guys in here?

55:50.256 --> 55:52.200
What is going on?

55:55.856 --> 55:57.800
Whats going on?

55:58.216 --> 56:00.615
Wheres Tamara?
What are you doing in here?

56:00.656 --> 56:02.655
I was going to ask you the same thing.

56:02.696 --> 56:05.015
What are you doing with her things?
None of your business.

56:05.056 --> 56:08.055
Of course its my business.
Shes my... No!

56:08.096 --> 56:11.335
Thats the last thing I remember.

56:11.376 --> 56:13.375
My God.

56:13.416 --> 56:16.255
Somebody found you practically
dead on the beach.

56:17.336 --> 56:20.495
You walked in when
he was robbing me blind.

56:20.536 --> 56:22.480
It almost worked.

56:23.208 --> 56:25.152
It did work.

56:25.176 --> 56:26.775
What?

56:26.816 --> 56:30.895
He robbed me of almost
everything and now hes gone.

56:30.936 --> 56:33.375
Well, we have to find
that son of a bitch.

56:33.416 --> 56:36.055
Look, you just work on
getting better, OK?

56:36.096 --> 56:38.175
Lets just be grateful
were all still alive.

56:38.216 --> 56:40.215
Thank God he didn't try to kill Tamara.

56:40.256 --> 56:42.015
He almost killed me.

56:42.056 --> 56:43.375
How are we supposed to catch him?

56:43.416 --> 56:45.735
I mean, the police,
the coastguard, customs,

56:45.776 --> 56:47.415
theyve all been searching for him

56:47.456 --> 56:49.575
but they don't have a thing to go on.

56:49.616 --> 56:51.575
Theyre looking for the wrong man.

56:52.328 --> 56:54.272
What do you mean?

56:54.296 --> 56:56.815
Hes not Italian.

56:56.856 --> 56:58.815
I heard him speak Portuguese.

56:58.856 --> 57:00.855
Hes from Brazil.

57:00.896 --> 57:02.455
When did you hear that?

57:02.496 --> 57:04.455
Right before he knocked me out.

57:04.496 --> 57:09.015
He said, "Adeus, a minha carinha."

57:09.056 --> 57:13.415
I had a Brazilian boyfriend who used
to say that to me all the time.

57:13.456 --> 57:17.255
It means, "Goodbye, my dear."

57:17.296 --> 57:20.175
Theyve been searching the database
for an Italian when, all the while,

57:20.216 --> 57:22.215
they should have been searching
for a Brazilian.

57:22.256 --> 57:26.255
Find him. Put his ass in jail
and throw away the key.

57:30.136 --> 57:32.080
I have a phone call to make.

57:38.096 --> 57:40.375
Hello. Hello, officer.
Its Tamara Sharp.

57:40.416 --> 57:41.655
Miss Sharp, Im sorry,

57:41.696 --> 57:44.255
but we havent found
any more signs of Mr Pizzinni.

57:44.296 --> 57:46.415
Yeah, well,
I have some new information.

57:46.456 --> 57:47.855
Can you check something for me?

57:47.896 --> 57:49.855
No problem, Miss Sharp. What is it?

57:49.896 --> 57:53.335
Well, its come to my attention
that Mr Pizzinni is not Italian

57:53.376 --> 57:55.615
but might be Brazilian.OK.

57:55.656 --> 57:57.455
Can you check the database for me?

57:57.496 --> 58:01.175
Yeah. I know there might be
a lot of Brazilians in Hawaii,

58:01.216 --> 58:03.535
but we do know his approximate dates,

58:03.576 --> 58:05.375
his age and what he looks like,

58:05.416 --> 58:07.735
so maybe you can
cross-reference them?

58:07.776 --> 58:10.095
Theres several hundred
names on this list.

58:10.136 --> 58:13.615
Well, can you whittle it down
to dates and his age range?

58:13.656 --> 58:15.975
OK. Ive got it down to 50,
so what Ill do is

58:16.016 --> 58:20.375
I'll match the names with passport
photos and, to make things easier,

58:20.416 --> 58:23.255
Im going to send you the list
since you know what he looks like.

58:23.296 --> 58:24.935
I still have your e-mail

58:24.976 --> 58:28.055
and you should have it
in your inbox shortly.

58:28.096 --> 58:30.015
OK.

58:30.056 --> 58:32.000
Thank you. I appreciate it.

58:39.336 --> 58:41.280
Here it is.

58:43.968 --> 58:45.912
What are you waiting for?

58:45.936 --> 58:48.615
Im afraid. Dont be afraid.

58:48.656 --> 58:50.895
Hes the one should be afraid.

58:50.936 --> 58:52.055
What if hes not here?

58:52.096 --> 58:54.855
Then were not going to stop
looking until we find him.

58:59.096 --> 59:01.215
There. Where? Go back.

59:01.256 --> 59:02.815
Right there, right there.

59:02.856 --> 59:04.800
That is him. My God! Thats him.

59:06.816 --> 59:09.895
Whats his name? Frederico Candido.

59:09.936 --> 59:11.880
The slimeball.

59:12.168 --> 59:14.112
What should we do now?

59:14.136 --> 59:17.255
Now we call my friends at the FBI.

59:17.296 --> 59:19.240
Theyll know where he is.

59:29.129 --> 59:31.073
So lets go over this plan again.

59:31.097 --> 59:32.896
Im not really good
at this kind of thing.

59:32.937 --> 59:34.976
You think I am?
Ive never done this before.

59:38.337 --> 59:41.456
Sherry, are you sure
youre OK doing this?

59:42.897 --> 59:45.256
No, but we don't really have
a better plan, do we?

59:45.297 --> 59:47.376
I mean, weve been
over this 1,000 times.

59:47.417 --> 59:48.976
This was the best plan.

59:49.017 --> 59:52.696
OK, now first, well go
and stake out his house.

59:52.737 --> 59:55.336
And then well wait. OK?

59:55.377 --> 59:58.816
Yeah, OK, OK. I got it. I got it.

01:00:25.657 --> 01:00:28.016
My gosh!

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.536
Do you think he bought
that house with my money?

01:00:30.577 --> 01:00:33.256
Probably your money and
a lot of other girls money.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.816
Thats why we have to stop him.

01:00:34.857 --> 01:00:37.176
Who knows how many lives hes destroyed.

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.896
Yeah.

01:00:38.937 --> 01:00:41.416
So what, do we just wait here?

01:00:41.457 --> 01:00:45.296
Yeah. We have to make sure
that this is his home.

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:48.456
The FBI told me that the information
they gave me cant be verified.

01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:52.241
My gosh. Is that him?

01:00:53.897 --> 01:00:55.841
Yes, thats him.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.473
OK, now Im kind of scared.

01:00:59.497 --> 01:01:00.856
Why don't we just call the police?

01:01:00.897 --> 01:01:04.136
No! Because they wont
get all my money back...

01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:08.736
and I want to make him suffer
for what he did to me and Dena.

01:01:53.617 --> 01:01:55.736
Sherry! Wake up. Its him!

01:02:32.297 --> 01:02:34.416
How do I look?

01:02:34.457 --> 01:02:36.416
Irresistible.OK.

01:02:39.929 --> 01:02:41.873
What are you doing?

01:02:41.897 --> 01:02:43.456
You need protection.

01:02:43.497 --> 01:02:46.216
I am not planning on having...

01:02:46.257 --> 01:02:47.656
OK. I really thought you were

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:50.016
taking something else
out of your bag there.

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:54.416
Sherry, seriously, OK? This is
the safety and you pull this back.

01:02:54.457 --> 01:02:57.456
I know how to use a gun, sweetie.
Im from Georgia.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.681
Are you OK?

01:03:05.209 --> 01:03:07.153
Yeah. Yes, I can do this.

01:03:07.177 --> 01:03:08.936
Im good. No problem. I can do this,

01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:11.216
as long as he doesn't recognise me.

01:03:11.257 --> 01:03:14.536
Well, he only saw you that
one time when we first arrived.

01:03:14.577 --> 01:03:16.576
And he only had eyes for you.

01:03:16.617 --> 01:03:18.736
And tonight, hell be looking at you.

01:03:18.777 --> 01:03:20.721
Be careful.

01:03:21.017 --> 01:03:23.176
I will.OK.

01:03:57.577 --> 01:03:59.521
Looks familiar.

01:04:10.769 --> 01:04:12.713
Are you waiting for somebody?

01:04:12.737 --> 01:04:14.976
Im waiting for a friend, yeah.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.216
Girlfriend? Boyfriend?

01:04:17.257 --> 01:04:19.216
A girlfriend.

01:04:19.257 --> 01:04:21.656
Were supposed to have
a girls night out tonight.

01:04:21.697 --> 01:04:24.256
Im going to get a little wild,
have some fun, you know.

01:04:24.297 --> 01:04:26.816
I know. Good.

01:04:30.769 --> 01:04:32.713
Whats wrong?

01:04:32.737 --> 01:04:34.216
Well, she just text me.

01:04:34.257 --> 01:04:37.136
Shes not coming.

01:04:37.177 --> 01:04:38.576
Thats just too bad.

01:04:38.617 --> 01:04:40.496
Yeah. What are you going to do?

01:04:40.537 --> 01:04:44.176
I don't know.
All dressed up, nowhere to go.

01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:47.153
Whats your name?

01:04:47.177 --> 01:04:50.656
Im Elizabeth.
But my friends call me Lizzie.

01:04:50.697 --> 01:04:52.096
Nice to meet you, Lizzie.

01:04:52.137 --> 01:04:53.936
Nice to meet you. Im Mario.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:56.776
But my friends call me
all sorts of things.

01:04:56.817 --> 01:05:00.256
All nice, I hope.Yeah.
All good stuff.

01:05:01.737 --> 01:05:04.136
Well, then, what should I call you?
You can call me Mario.

01:05:04.177 --> 01:05:08.176
But thats my secret agent name.

01:05:08.217 --> 01:05:10.776
So youre a secret agent?

01:05:10.817 --> 01:05:13.496
Sh. Dont tell anyone.
Its a secret.

01:05:23.489 --> 01:05:25.433
You like sports cars?

01:05:25.457 --> 01:05:26.976
Yeah. Doesnt everyone?

01:05:27.017 --> 01:05:29.816
Thats good. Would you like to
go on a ride with me?

01:05:29.857 --> 01:05:33.016
OK. You will take
good care of me, wont you?

01:05:33.057 --> 01:05:36.696
Absolutely.
Youre like a beautiful flower.

01:05:36.737 --> 01:05:39.976
Not only will I take care of you,
I will nurture you.

01:05:40.017 --> 01:05:42.456
You are safe with me.

01:05:42.497 --> 01:05:44.441
All right.

01:06:41.937 --> 01:06:45.056
Boy, you really know
how to handle this car.

01:06:45.097 --> 01:06:49.216
I used to race cars
when I was younger in Italy.

01:06:49.257 --> 01:06:51.216
Did you?

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.736
Yes, in Modena.

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:27.816
Sherry? Hello, Miss Sharp.

01:07:27.857 --> 01:07:31.776
Hi, Agent Benjamin.
Thanks for calling me back.

01:07:31.817 --> 01:07:34.896
We did a further search
on Frederico Candido.

01:07:34.937 --> 01:07:40.016
Yeah. Well, Mr Candida got out
of jail recently. He did?

01:07:40.057 --> 01:07:43.256
Yes, but theres something
even more startling.

01:07:43.297 --> 01:07:46.176
Mr Candido was your fathers
cellmate before he died.

01:07:46.217 --> 01:07:49.496
But, how is that even possible?
Thats too much of a coincidence.

01:07:49.537 --> 01:07:51.496
Unfortunately, its not a coincidence.

01:07:51.537 --> 01:07:53.256
We believe that Mr Candido
targeted you.

01:07:53.297 --> 01:07:55.776
I think its safe to assume
your father told Mr Candido

01:07:55.817 --> 01:07:57.096
all about the inheritance.

01:07:57.137 --> 01:07:58.176
My God.

01:07:58.217 --> 01:08:01.336
Theres more. It seems that your
father didn't die of natural causes

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.336
but might have been
murdered in his cell.

01:08:03.377 --> 01:08:06.216
The medical examiner thought that
your father died of a heart attack,

01:08:06.257 --> 01:08:08.216
but it appears that the heart attack

01:08:08.257 --> 01:08:10.256
was brought on by asphyxiation.

01:08:10.297 --> 01:08:14.256
My God! Miss Sharp,
Mr Candido is a career con artist.

01:08:14.297 --> 01:08:17.015
Thankfully, though, we have enough
evidence now to arrest him.

01:08:17.057 --> 01:08:19.656
Well need your help, though.
Yes, of course.

01:08:30.216 --> 01:08:32.161
Here we are.

01:08:37.377 --> 01:08:39.321
Welcome.

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:47.673
My house.

01:08:47.697 --> 01:08:49.640
Yes.

01:08:52.897 --> 01:08:55.376
So have you lived here long?

01:08:55.417 --> 01:08:56.895
Yeah.

01:08:56.937 --> 01:08:58.656
I live alone.

01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:01.975
I like big places and
I can enjoy this place by myself.

01:09:08.697 --> 01:09:12.656
Your kitchen is beautiful. I could
cook some fabulous dinners in here.

01:09:12.697 --> 01:09:15.576
Youre a cook? I dabble.

01:09:15.617 --> 01:09:18.456
Whats your speciality? Italian.

01:09:18.497 --> 01:09:25.176
Should we have a drink?
Of course. How rude of me. Sorry.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:43.912
Here you go.

01:09:43.937 --> 01:09:45.881
To new friends. To new friends.

01:10:06.257 --> 01:10:08.496
Grazie. You speak Italian?

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:11.936
No, I just figured you were
saying something complimentary.

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:39.736
I guess you don't hold your alcohol
too well, do you, Mr Frederico?

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:51.536
Tamara! Tamara!

01:10:57.137 --> 01:10:59.776
It worked? Hes sleeping like
a baby in the kitchen.

01:11:03.337 --> 01:11:05.496
Youre good.
I didn't know I had it in me.

01:11:11.177 --> 01:11:13.336
What do you think?

01:11:13.377 --> 01:11:15.321
My God!

01:11:20.457 --> 01:11:22.401
What are we looking for?

01:11:23.057 --> 01:11:25.456
Wherever he keeps his bank statements.

01:11:25.497 --> 01:11:27.736
Sherry, look at these pictures.

01:11:27.777 --> 01:11:29.776
He has a family.

01:11:29.817 --> 01:11:31.761
And kids.

01:11:46.057 --> 01:11:49.336
Yeah. OK. Here we go.

01:11:49.377 --> 01:11:51.816
You take those drawers
and Ill take these.

01:12:01.577 --> 01:12:06.136
Bingo. All of his bank
statements are in here.

01:12:07.297 --> 01:12:09.241
My God. Look at this.

01:12:09.889 --> 01:12:11.833
Youve got to be kidding me.

01:12:11.857 --> 01:12:13.296
How many people has he robbed?

01:12:13.337 --> 01:12:15.656
All of the money is
in offshore accounts.

01:12:17.697 --> 01:12:19.641
What do we do now?

01:12:19.977 --> 01:12:21.921
We wait.

01:12:32.777 --> 01:12:35.576
God, when is this guy going to wake up?

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:38.776
Hes a heavy sleeper.
Trust me, I know.

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:41.336
Shall we wake him up?

01:12:41.377 --> 01:12:43.736
What name do you think
you would answer to?

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:46.856
I think you should try Frederico.
Maybe he misses his mommy!

01:12:55.297 --> 01:12:57.696
Frederico, its time to wake up.

01:12:59.297 --> 01:13:01.241
Frederico, wake up!

01:13:01.737 --> 01:13:05.056
Maybe we killed him. We didn't
kill him. Hes still moving.

01:13:09.657 --> 01:13:11.776
Remember me? Tamara?

01:13:11.817 --> 01:13:14.976
He remembers.Nice.

01:13:15.017 --> 01:13:17.936
What are you doing?
Im getting whats mine.

01:13:19.169 --> 01:13:21.113
Let me go. Why am I tied up?
Whats going on?

01:13:21.137 --> 01:13:23.736
Were teaching your lesson.
You almost killed our best friend.

01:13:23.777 --> 01:13:25.296
And youre too stupid to realise

01:13:25.337 --> 01:13:27.656
that Sherry was with
Dena and I in Hawaii.

01:13:28.897 --> 01:13:31.816
Go to hell. Of course I knew.

01:13:31.857 --> 01:13:34.776
You go to hell.
But first, I want my money back.

01:13:34.817 --> 01:13:36.456
What money?
What are you talking about?

01:13:36.497 --> 01:13:39.656
Dont you think its time
to stop lying... Dario?

01:13:40.857 --> 01:13:43.256
You girls are so stupid.
You cant get away with this.

01:13:43.297 --> 01:13:45.536
OK.

01:13:45.577 --> 01:13:48.456
Why don't you tell me about my father?

01:13:48.497 --> 01:13:49.816
What about your father?

01:13:49.857 --> 01:13:52.456
Did you kill him? No.

01:13:52.497 --> 01:13:54.096
Admit it! You killed him!

01:13:54.137 --> 01:13:55.376
What are you talking about?

01:13:55.417 --> 01:13:57.536
Yeah. Frederico here
was my fathers cellmate.

01:13:57.577 --> 01:13:59.576
My father told him all
about my inheritance

01:13:59.617 --> 01:14:01.056
and he planned the whole thing.

01:14:01.097 --> 01:14:03.416
Yeah, your father told me
everything about you...

01:14:04.377 --> 01:14:07.136
and I fell for you.
Ive been watching you.

01:14:07.177 --> 01:14:12.496
Yeah. No, you fell for a
description that my father gave you.

01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:14.576
My father didn't even know me.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.296
Yeah, I saw pictures of you.

01:14:16.337 --> 01:14:17.616
I had to have you.

01:14:17.657 --> 01:14:19.496
So then you took my money?

01:14:19.537 --> 01:14:22.096
Well, you fell for me.
What else was there but the money?

01:14:22.137 --> 01:14:24.816
You disgusting excuse
for a human being.

01:14:24.857 --> 01:14:26.936
You know what?
I should shoot you right now.

01:14:26.977 --> 01:14:29.416
Shoot him, Sherry! Shoot him now!

01:14:29.457 --> 01:14:30.816
All right! All right! OK!

01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:33.576
I'll transfer
all the money into your account.

01:14:33.617 --> 01:14:35.136
Youll do more than that.

01:14:35.177 --> 01:14:38.696
You are going to transfer every bit
of money from your accounts.

01:14:38.737 --> 01:14:40.976
No! You don't have a choice.

01:14:41.017 --> 01:14:43.136
I earned that money. My God!

01:14:43.177 --> 01:14:45.456
OK.Really?
Thats seriously amusing.

01:14:45.497 --> 01:14:48.576
The money is going to be
transferred into an FBI account,

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:51.736
then they will dole out the money
to all of your victims.

01:14:51.777 --> 01:14:54.696
You cant get away with this!
I know people. Theyre on their way.

01:14:54.737 --> 01:14:58.096
Theyre coming. Well, I guess
wed better get to work now.

01:14:58.137 --> 01:15:00.081
You cant get away with this.

01:15:15.329 --> 01:15:17.273
Are there any more?

01:15:17.297 --> 01:15:19.256
Thats it. Are you happy now?

01:15:20.497 --> 01:15:22.816
I wont be happy
until youre back in jail.

01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:27.681
Tell me one thing.

01:15:29.497 --> 01:15:31.441
What? Did you love me?

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.856
I didn't love you. Yes, you did.

01:15:37.897 --> 01:15:42.376
You fell in love with me. I fell in
love with someone who doesn't exist.

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:43.936
Youre a con artist.

01:15:43.977 --> 01:15:45.736
You disgust me.

01:15:45.777 --> 01:15:47.296
Yeah, you looked disgusted

01:15:47.337 --> 01:15:49.856
when you were making love
with me on my yacht.

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:53.361
You call that love?

01:15:55.497 --> 01:15:57.816
Youre going to have to shoot
your friend to get to me.

01:16:00.777 --> 01:16:03.736
Its OK. Its over.

01:16:03.777 --> 01:16:06.936
Its over. Lets call the police.

01:16:06.977 --> 01:16:08.921
Come on. Lets get out of here.

01:16:55.337 --> 01:16:59.216
Dena! Tamara! Sherry!

01:17:04.329 --> 01:17:06.273
Im so much better.

01:17:06.297 --> 01:17:07.656
You look it.

01:17:07.697 --> 01:17:10.496
The doctor said Ill be 100%
after a few months of therapy,

01:17:10.537 --> 01:17:12.376
but I feel good.

01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:16.776
You look fantastic.
I missed you guys so much.

01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:19.856
How are you?
Where have you guys been?

01:17:19.897 --> 01:17:22.976
Weve had some business to take care of.

01:17:23.017 --> 01:17:25.376
What kind of business?

01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:28.536
Lets just say
we had some banking to do.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.176
Did you get your money back?

01:17:30.217 --> 01:17:31.696
We got her money back

01:17:31.737 --> 01:17:35.736
and we got back the money
of every person he ever conned.

01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:37.376
Is he in jail?

01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:41.376
Hes in a place where he can
never hurt anyone ever again.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.521
Thank you, guys.

01:17:51.777 --> 01:17:54.056
I might need a little help. OK!

01:18:05.777 --> 01:18:08.336
OK, ladies. Im ready.

01:18:09.577 --> 01:18:12.816
Dont you dare take
any pictures without me.

01:18:12.857 --> 01:18:16.536
We wouldnt dream of it.
You OK? I feel great.

01:18:16.577 --> 01:18:18.616
I love you guys.

01:18:18.657 --> 01:18:20.216
Thank you for being there for me.

01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:22.576
Of course.
Were just glad youre healthy.

01:18:22.617 --> 01:18:25.456
Yes, and Im just glad
we could finally finish this trip.

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:27.576
No men this time.

01:18:27.617 --> 01:18:29.456
God, no. Definitely no men.

01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.441
No. Selfie.

01:18:32.737 --> 01:18:35.416
Nothing like a little closure.
You got that right.
