00:05.273 --> 00:07.241
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:07.275 --> 00:08.476
[Emily] We're really in France.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.478
Austin Tucker?
Didn't he say he won Worlds

00:10.511 --> 00:12.313
with the worst
hangover of his life?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.148
[Lauren] I'm pretty sure that
was his Olympic gold medal.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.350
I'm... I'm not a fan.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.818
Maybe we could do
something about that.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.053
Emily needs closure with Damon.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.522
I could leave for Paris this
afternoon and be back by curfew.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.457
You're going to say goodbye?

00:25.093 --> 00:27.328
What if her train is late
or Ellen Beals catches her?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.596
She could get suspended.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.131
Hello, Emily.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.265
Having a nice night?

00:31.299 --> 00:34.068
[Nastia] Lauren Tanner
will be competing today...

00:34.102 --> 00:35.569
- Yes!
- ...in place of Emily Kmetko.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.472
And here's word from the
National Committee.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.509
Unfortunately Payson's
petition has been denied.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.512
She will not be joining
the national team this year.

00:45.646 --> 00:49.483
Time to jam to The Rock,
hotshots. Let's go.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.619
I'm not going today.
I don't feel well.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.621
- Are you sick?
- A little.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.624
I think I picked up
something nasty in France.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.060
I don't think I should push it.
I'm just gonna go back to bed.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.433
You're going to let her
get away with that?

01:05.466 --> 01:08.636
- Becca...
- She's obviously just
embarrassed to face Sasha.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.605
He told her she wasn't ready to
try out for the National Team.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.275
- Why didn't she listen?
- It's partly my fault.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.245
I encouraged her.
After all we've been through,

01:17.278 --> 01:19.513
I wanted to believe she
could have the back surgery

01:19.547 --> 01:21.615
and just pick up
where she left off.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.584
Well, what if she can't?

01:23.617 --> 01:26.220
Ever pick up where she left off?

01:26.254 --> 01:27.621
What are we gonna do then?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.395
Here's the laundry.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.665
Mother hates carnations.
I told Consuelo that!

01:37.698 --> 01:39.400
What am I gonna do?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.370
Chill. You've been stressing
for weeks about Gran's visit.

01:42.403 --> 01:46.907
[sighs] Consuelo used the
lavender spray didn't she?

01:46.940 --> 01:51.479
Mother considers anything less
than aromatic bath linens
uncivilized.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.415
Well there aren't enough
essential oils in the world

01:54.448 --> 01:55.616
to civilize this!

01:58.419 --> 02:01.222
Did Chloe Kmetko spend the night
here while I was in France?

02:01.255 --> 02:03.524
That's none of your business.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.626
I think you need
to get a vasectomy.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.662
- What?
- I'm sure she'd love
to trap you into marriage

02:08.696 --> 02:11.465
with an unplanned pregnancy.
And for the record,

02:11.499 --> 02:13.534
I wouldn't bring Chloe
around to meet Gran.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.169
Of course not.

02:15.203 --> 02:18.306
It's not serious enough yet
for her to meet Mother.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.642
And you know, if I were you
I'd be less worried
about my love life

02:21.675 --> 02:23.577
and more worried
about facing Sasha

02:23.611 --> 02:26.514
after you blabbed
that it was your idea

02:26.547 --> 02:30.351
to go to Beals behind his back
so she'd take you all to France.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.589
We're in deep you-know-what.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.590
Some of us deeper than others.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.559
Well, we were all asked in.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.229
And we all went behind
his back to go see Ellen Beals.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.198
Oh, good. You're all here.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.636
You're probably wondering
why I asked to see you
before practice.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.207
Congratulations on winning
the team silver in France.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.509
And double that to you, Kaylie,
for winning the all-around.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.612
I won the Bronze.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.581
That's exactly what I want
to see from you, Lauren.

03:00.614 --> 03:04.485
Oh, Emily, of course I'm
curious, why you didn't compete?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.588
I didn't compete because...

03:07.621 --> 03:09.657
I stepped out to get
some air in Calais

03:09.690 --> 03:12.460
even though we weren't supposed
to leave the hotel room.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.428
And even though I was
back before bed check,

03:14.462 --> 03:17.631
Ellen Beals found out and
wouldn't let me participate
in the meet.

03:17.665 --> 03:21.602
It's a very tough lesson.
I hoped you learned something.

03:21.635 --> 03:25.673
I did. I'm more committed
than ever to my gymnastics.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.242
I'm glad to hear it.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.477
Excuse me, question?

03:29.510 --> 03:32.646
I hope this means I'm ranked
number two at The Rock again.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.815
You'll be ranked how and when I
decide, the moment I decide it.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.453
Now, go on. Get to practice.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.627
- Kaylie?
- Mm-hm?

03:46.660 --> 03:47.661
Can I have a word?

03:47.695 --> 03:50.030
Uh...

03:50.063 --> 03:54.602
I hope you're convinced
you now deserve to be
the National Champion.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.405
I am.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.308
It's really starting
to sink in now.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.711
I'm number one, I deserve it.

04:05.313 --> 04:08.516
And, uh, it's time
I started acting like it.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.719
This is my gym now.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.854
Good.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.424
Good.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.459
You know, the reason your name
is on the wall out there,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.628
isn't just to remind
everyone that you won
Nationals this year,

04:20.661 --> 04:23.531
but to remind them that you
are the leader of this gym.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.534
And as such, you set
the example for all the girls

04:26.567 --> 04:28.702
who train here and
on the national team.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.339
Everything they do,
every victory,

04:31.372 --> 04:34.475
every mistake,
is your responsibility.

04:34.508 --> 04:39.313
Including the fact that Emily
disobeyed the rules in France
and didn't compete.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.615
I know.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.084
I wasn't the best leader
in France,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.687
but it won't ever happen again.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.424
And just to make sure
it won't, I have a plan.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.596
Way to go, Pinocchio.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.598
I wonder what
Sasha would do

04:57.631 --> 04:59.767
if he knew the truth
about Damon and Paris?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.803
I wonder what he'd do if he knew
you and Carter were having sex

05:02.836 --> 05:05.473
every night in your little
love shack above the garage?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.708
You don't have to
threaten me, Emily.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.610
I would never tell on you.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.613
Us girls with boyfriends
need to stick together.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.649
I don't have a boyfriend
and I won't until after
the Olympics.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.618
That's what I want to hear.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.621
Look, it's my job as
the National Champ

05:20.654 --> 05:23.424
and team leader to keep
our eyes on the prize

05:23.457 --> 05:25.693
we've worked for
our whole lives.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.362
Which is why I got us these.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.530
Promise rings.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.433
To remind us
of our one true goal.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.134
Olympic gold.

05:34.167 --> 05:38.105
With these rings, we promise to
focus on nothing but gymnastics

05:38.138 --> 05:41.675
and forsake the biggest
distraction of all: boys.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.382
That one's for Payson.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.718
Last I heard, you're not
doing any forsaking,

05:50.751 --> 05:52.653
No more boys, Em?

05:52.686 --> 05:56.724
There is not a boy in the world
that could keep me away
from the Olympics.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.827
[rock music playing]

06:37.798 --> 06:40.534
What is Austin Tucker
doing here?

07:09.863 --> 07:11.532
Hey!

07:11.565 --> 07:14.635
Uh... What are you doing here?

07:14.668 --> 07:16.770
I'm training
at The Rock now.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.806
Does Sasha know about this?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.641
Actually, it was his idea.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.677
But it's only until
I can build my own gym.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.613
Your own gym?

07:25.646 --> 07:28.482
Yeah, my sponsors
are springing for it.
Next to my new lake house.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.618
- You're moving to Boulder?
- You got everything here.

07:30.651 --> 07:33.621
Waterskiing in the summer,
snowboarding in the winter...

07:33.654 --> 07:37.257
- ...college co-eds year round.
- Big surprise.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.859
You're not here
for the gymnastics.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.862
Listen, I respect that
I'm a guest in your gym.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.964
Promise, you'll hardly
know that I'm here.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.067
[mechanized door opening]

07:52.573 --> 07:54.975
- What is that?
- My parallel bars.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.646
I can see that. The gym is full.
Where do you expect to put them?

07:58.679 --> 08:01.582
In place of the second set
of uneven bars.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.886
What? Has standing and staring
become an Olympic event?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.555
Get moving.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.626
- Hey, man, good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.632
Are you sure this isn't going to
be a distraction for the girls?

08:18.666 --> 08:21.769
Austin Tucker seems to attract
a lot of female attention.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.071
It just means they'll
have to focus even harder.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.674
Austin is a living, breathing
Olympic gold medalist.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.643
Having him here will challenge
the girls... in every way.

08:29.677 --> 08:33.681
I hope he won't challenge
the no-dating rule.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.849
He's known for being
a bit of a player.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.986
I'm well aware of that,
but he has a type...

08:39.019 --> 08:40.721
And it's not
female gymnasts.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.091
Well, people's types can change.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.695
Oh, like how you used to
have the hots for Steve Tanner,
for some reason,

08:47.728 --> 08:49.663
and now you're attracted to me?

08:51.031 --> 08:54.802
[sighs] Adults. Relief.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.137
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.973
No Payson?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.775
She isn't feeling well,

09:01.809 --> 09:04.978
which means she isn't
feeling up to facing you.

09:06.747 --> 09:10.684
I need to ask you something and
you have to be brutally honest.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.019
All right.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.690
Will Payson ever be ready to
petition onto the national team?

09:16.724 --> 09:20.728
Or do the changes in her body
mean her Olympic dream is dead?

09:32.773 --> 09:33.974
[hard metal playing]

10:15.182 --> 10:16.717
Gran! This one's for you!

10:22.155 --> 10:24.792
Sweet girl, you terrify me

10:24.825 --> 10:27.928
every time you get on
that godforsaken thing.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.731
Can't you find another
life or death hobby?

10:30.764 --> 10:32.199
Like shopping at Filene's?

10:33.767 --> 10:36.203
Mrs. Tanner,
how nice to see you.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.806
Summer Van Horn!

10:38.839 --> 10:41.709
I can't tell you how
absolutely devastated I was

10:41.742 --> 10:44.044
that you broke off your
engagement to my son.

10:44.077 --> 10:47.114
Yes, I got your card, thank you.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.050
You're the only women he's ever
brought home that I approved of.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.055
Besides Lauren's mother.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.058
Before Leslie got
into the drugs.

10:59.259 --> 11:03.230
Well, Leslie made this
lovely and talented girl

11:03.263 --> 11:04.965
and I'm sure she's
very proud of her.

11:04.998 --> 11:09.236
Yeah, so proud,
she stood me up at Nationals.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.841
Wouldn't it be great if Summer
and Dad got back together?

11:13.874 --> 11:16.710
Well, I haven't given up.
Have you, Lauren?

11:16.744 --> 11:18.478
Nope!

11:18.511 --> 11:20.180
Well, thank you.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.250
But, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get back to work.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.252
Enjoy your visit,
Mrs. Tanner.

11:27.888 --> 11:31.892
It's such a tragedy that Daddy's
fallen for someone else now.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.795
Hmm, your father didn't mention
he was seeing anyone.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.797
Because he knows
you won't approve.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.000
He's probably just
gonna keep her tucked
away until the wedding.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.736
And between you and me,
she's just after his money.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.773
Which I guess someday would
include your money.

11:45.806 --> 11:50.010
- Hmm.
- I just hope something
stops them in time.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.713
[rock music playing]

11:55.883 --> 11:58.518
Wow. You must chafe easily.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.088
Or you've got a fetish
for neoprene.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.523
I'm trying to practice.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.761
Wow, how soon she forgets
the guy who filled her tin cup

12:07.795 --> 12:10.864
with a ticket to Calais when
she was stranded in Le Metro

12:10.898 --> 12:12.933
doing seal tricks for Euros.

12:12.966 --> 12:16.269
Why did you come
to The Rock? Really?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.304
For you of course.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.774
- [scoffs]
- [laughs]

12:20.808 --> 12:22.509
I had to check out
the legendary Emily,

12:22.542 --> 12:25.345
who shattered Damon Young's
heart into a million pieces.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.047
Very funny.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.917
Can't a guy just like
pine trees and microbrew?

12:30.851 --> 12:33.153
Emily! Focus!

12:33.186 --> 12:36.156
[whispering] Oh no! You're
in trouble with Fraulein Cruz.

12:37.825 --> 12:41.328
* My boyfriend is a rock star

12:41.361 --> 12:43.831
* And he calls me
on the phone *

12:43.864 --> 12:45.933
* I'm gonna take him back

12:45.966 --> 12:48.869
Do you really need to take up
an entire parking space

12:48.902 --> 12:51.104
with your... crotch rocket?

12:52.005 --> 12:54.307
Shh...
She didn't mean it.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.046
Lolita is a 1948 Indian Chief.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.814
I rebuilt her
from the ground up.

13:00.848 --> 13:04.852
Flathead engine, 1200 CCs,
and she has feelings.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.286
You named your motorcycle?

13:07.387 --> 13:10.924
Listen, I respect that you're
the star here at The Rock.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.093
I'm not here to steal
your thunder.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.828
In fact, I think
I could help you.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.865
I'm the National Champion.
I don't need your help.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.109
You're looking well, Mother.

13:29.142 --> 13:33.113
So are you. I see you've
cut back on the hair gel.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.949
Uh, I... I guess.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.318
Probably because
you have less hair.

13:39.987 --> 13:44.191
I think I'll have
a drink. Mother?

13:44.224 --> 13:47.060
I thought you'd never ask.
Is it 5:30 yet?

13:47.094 --> 13:49.963
- It is somewhere.
- [giggles]

13:49.997 --> 13:53.033
So. What's new around here?

13:53.066 --> 13:56.069
Just, uh... the usual.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.972
Not according to your daughter.

13:59.006 --> 14:03.877
She tells me you're
dating someone... a Chloe...

14:03.911 --> 14:05.012
...and it's serious.

14:05.045 --> 14:09.917
It's not that serious.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.619
Daddy, don't be shy.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.922
You've practically
given her house keys.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.324
Which is why we're all
having dinner tomorrow night.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.127
I've already made plans
with your chef.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.196
Do you think your "Chloe"
has an opinion on Basque?

14:30.670 --> 14:34.041
Payson? There's
someone here to see you.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.379
- I'll make us some tea.
- Thank you.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.985
Look, you were right
and I was wrong.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.054
I wasn't ready to petition
onto the national team

14:47.087 --> 14:50.057
and now I've blown my only
chance to get on to the team
and to go to Worlds.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.959
This year. Maybe.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.694
But what about next?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.663
After I've grown another inch?

14:56.696 --> 15:01.034
Let's face it,
my body's changing

15:01.068 --> 15:03.036
and I'll never be
the same gymnast I was.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.105
Yeah, that's true.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.342
But, you can be
a different kind of gymnast.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.677
Instead of being
a power gymnast,

15:10.710 --> 15:12.312
you can be a more
of an artistic gymnast.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.948
- Like Nastia.
- But I'm not like her.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.349
See, I disagree.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.986
Nastia came back from
a stress fracture to her spine,

15:19.019 --> 15:22.455
ankle surgery, and a nine-inch
growth spurt in a period
of just five years.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.491
She didn't have the power
of a Shawn Johnson.

15:24.524 --> 15:28.195
What she had was meticulous
execution and artistry.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.262
Don't you get it?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.965
Nastia's legs are longer
than mine, and she's a twig!

15:31.999 --> 15:35.102
She's built for all that
graceful dance stuff.
I'm just not!

15:35.135 --> 15:37.137
- Payson, just hear me out...
- No!

15:37.170 --> 15:39.939
Sasha, if that's your plan,
then it's over for me.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.976
I can't be an artistic gymnast.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.544
- I can't!
- Payson...

15:47.514 --> 15:48.948
[door shuts]

15:56.323 --> 15:58.191
Is Payson coming
to the gym today?

15:59.459 --> 16:01.995
Your sister just had
a reactive moment.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.332
She's never been one to give up.
So yeah, I think she is.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.138
Time to get dressed
for The Rock, Pay.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.240
I'm not going.
You heard me tell Sasha.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.443
So that's it? No discussion?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.379
It's your world
and we all just live in it?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.281
I don't see how it has
anything to do with you.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.084
Excuse me?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.087
It's my life, not yours.

16:28.788 --> 16:33.093
Right. And when I packed up this
family and moved us to Boulder

16:33.126 --> 16:35.162
when you decided this was
where you wanted to train,

16:35.195 --> 16:36.563
that had nothing to do
with my life.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.765
And getting up every day
at the crack of dawn

16:38.798 --> 16:41.801
to drive you to practice has
nothing to do with my life.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.338
And it didn't affect my
life when I had to agonize
with your father

16:45.372 --> 16:47.507
over whether or not to let
you have a risky back surgery

16:47.540 --> 16:49.242
to keep your dream alive.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.811
You may not see how your choices
have anything to do with us.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.247
- But we sure do.
- What do you expect me to do?

16:54.281 --> 16:57.584
I expect you to stop
being selfish and try

16:57.617 --> 17:00.187
what your coach
wants you to do!

17:00.220 --> 17:03.090
For God's sake, I gave up
my whole life for you!

17:03.123 --> 17:05.125
Whose fault is that, Mom?

17:05.158 --> 17:08.395
Fine. You want to give up?
Give up. I'll give up too.

17:08.428 --> 17:13.200
You can do whatever you want.
Because it's your life!

17:15.268 --> 17:17.837
- [door slams]
- If no one's going
to The Rock today,

17:17.870 --> 17:19.206
can I go to the lake
with Avery?

17:20.373 --> 17:24.277
Sure. Let's everybody just do
whatever the hell they want.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.126
So much for us hardly
even knowing he's here.

17:39.159 --> 17:43.096
Of course, Olympic Champ
trumps National Champ,

17:43.130 --> 17:47.234
which is probably why his banner
is so much bigger than yours.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.635
I could care less
about his banner.

17:51.538 --> 17:55.108
Wow, that didn't take long.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.144
I'm glad Austin's
training at The Rock.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.446
It's good for business
and maybe Queen Kaylie

17:59.479 --> 18:01.381
will stop acting as if
her sweats don't stink.

18:01.414 --> 18:05.185
So, I missed you last night.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.254
How's life with Gran Tanner?

18:07.287 --> 18:10.257
Genius. I told her
about dad dating Chloe

18:10.290 --> 18:12.325
and she insisted he
invite her to dinner tonight.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.261
Hmm. What's so genius
about that?

18:14.294 --> 18:16.429
Gran is the biggest snob I know

18:16.463 --> 18:19.266
and my father lives
in mortal fear of her judgment.

18:19.299 --> 18:23.403
So, when Chloe walks in
wearing one of her
streetwalker specials,

18:23.436 --> 18:28.408
Gran will have a heart
attack and Dad will drop Miss
Tacky USA like a hot rock.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.343
- Lauren...
- Mission accomplished.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.578
So I'll see you later,
then, right?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.181
Actually, I'm going out
with Austin tonight

18:34.214 --> 18:36.483
to get a few cold ones.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.651
- What?
- Don't worry genius,

18:38.685 --> 18:40.320
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:48.395 --> 18:51.331
Good morning, fair Chloe.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.201
Stephen Blair Tanner, the Third!

18:54.234 --> 18:59.939
So it turns out my mother just
hopped into town unexpectedly,

18:59.972 --> 19:03.710
and she would love
to meet you and Emily.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.346
You told your mother about us?

19:07.614 --> 19:11.551
Wow! I mean, that
means a lot to me, Steve.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.586
Yes, well, of course I did.

19:13.620 --> 19:17.390
But it is last minute
and of course if you
have other plans...

19:17.424 --> 19:19.359
Oh, no, no, nothing
I can't change.

19:19.392 --> 19:23.230
I mean, this is a big deal
right? Meeting your mother?

19:23.263 --> 19:25.332
I have to tell you,
she's pretty tough.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.734
Very... exacting.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.604
Steve, you don't ever have to
be embarrassed about your mother
around me.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.642
[girls chattering, giggling]

19:35.675 --> 19:38.578
Look at all them in
full makeup for practice.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.748
Yep, Austin Tucker's
inspiring the girls all right.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.416
To be dingbats.

19:43.450 --> 19:47.354
This is an elite gym,
not Spring Break in Daytona.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.523
He's taking Carter out
to drink tonight.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.225
Some influence.

19:52.259 --> 19:55.628
I say as long as he stays
on that side of the gym,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.564
we just ignore him.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.332
Excuse me, what are you doing?

19:59.366 --> 20:02.001
Measuring for the men's
high bar. Austin wants
to put it here.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.771
- What?
- Oh, this is war!

20:04.804 --> 20:08.375
Um... I'm sorry to interrupt
your rigorous training,

20:08.408 --> 20:13.246
but for your information, the
men's high bar goes in the
annex building out back

20:13.280 --> 20:15.582
and that's where
it's gonna stay.

20:15.615 --> 20:19.319
Yeah, no. It's cold out there.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.754
- And the lighting sucks.
- Mmm, too bad.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.324
The girls are the
stars of this gym.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.592
We pay dues, too.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.460
But we're the ones that
put this gym on the map,

20:27.494 --> 20:32.031
and let's face it, no one
cares about men's gymnastics.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.701
- That was before I came along.
- [chuckling]

20:34.734 --> 20:36.603
I appreciate women's gymnastics,

20:36.636 --> 20:39.406
but men's gymnastics
are more challenging.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.275
We do six apparatuses,
you only do four.

20:42.309 --> 20:45.345
That's because the four
we do require more precision,

20:45.378 --> 20:47.747
artistry, and frankly, skill.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.483
We don't just tumble around
and flex our muscles.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.052
Hey, the men can do
anything you can do,

20:53.085 --> 20:57.023
but I'd like to see
the women do what we do.

20:57.056 --> 21:01.628
I've got an idea, why don't we
compete for space in The Rock?

21:01.661 --> 21:03.029
Boys against girls.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.398
We'd love to publicly
humiliate you,

21:05.432 --> 21:08.835
but Sasha's never letting
you put the high bar in here,
either way.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.837
I don't know about that.

21:10.870 --> 21:14.507
Any occasion to compete
with real stakes is a good
idea as far as I'm concerned.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.310
OK, but when we win,

21:17.344 --> 21:20.713
your parallel bars go
in the annex building, too.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.516
Fine by me, because when we win,
the high bars go there

21:23.550 --> 21:26.819
and your balance beam
goes to the arctic annex.

21:26.853 --> 21:27.887
Deal.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.723
You know, and just to make
things a little more fun,

21:30.757 --> 21:34.694
each gets to decide which
apparatus the other team
gets to compete on.

21:34.727 --> 21:40.333
Love it. Austin, we'd like
to see you compete on... beam.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.837
Carter Anderson, uneven bars.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.708
Lauren Tanner... Rings.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.877
Emily... Parallel bars.

21:50.910 --> 21:55.882
Floor. To music. And dance
choreography, just like a girl.

21:55.915 --> 21:58.818
- No way. I'm out.
- [laughing]

22:00.853 --> 22:03.490
I'll take the challenge, but
Kaylie has to do floor as well.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.825
Men's style, the required
amount of tumbles,

22:05.858 --> 22:09.396
which is... three times as much
as the girls are required to do.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.398
Done. It's on.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.400
[Carter] Like Donkey Kong.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.371
Goin' down!
You're goin' down.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.945
[dance music playing]

22:39.559 --> 22:41.494
* Push a little bit
louder, yeah *

22:41.528 --> 22:43.162
* Push a little bit stronger

22:43.195 --> 22:45.498
* Push a little bit
harder, yeah*

22:45.532 --> 22:46.933
* Push a little bit faster

22:46.966 --> 22:49.569
* Push a little bit
harder, yeah *

22:49.602 --> 22:50.970
* Push a little bit faster

22:54.974 --> 22:56.943
[grunting]

22:58.911 --> 23:00.980
[grunts]

23:02.449 --> 23:03.683
Ah!

23:07.186 --> 23:08.555
* Spin it, turn
roll it 'round *

23:08.588 --> 23:10.823
* DJ got style
and I like his vibe *

23:10.857 --> 23:12.592
* High tunes
I like 'em low *

23:12.625 --> 23:14.794
* Miss Monroe
is ready fo' sho' *

23:14.827 --> 23:16.763
* High school was for you

23:16.796 --> 23:18.698
* Music control
was my only goal *

23:18.731 --> 23:20.700
* Save my soul now, Mr. Lord

23:20.733 --> 23:22.835
* And you'll be ready
to dig some gold **

23:25.772 --> 23:26.673
[exclaims]

23:26.706 --> 23:28.475
Do you think this
is Sasha's punishment

23:28.508 --> 23:29.876
for us going to Beals
behind his back?

23:29.909 --> 23:33.446
If so, it's working.
I have bruises on my bruises.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.783
Look, all we have to do tomorrow
is suck less than the boys.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.752
And from what I saw today,
we've got this in the bag.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.992
Mom...

23:46.025 --> 23:47.994
I'll go to The Rock
tomorrow if you want.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.931
It isn't about what I want.
It's about what you want.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.934
Then, why do you care
if Payson quits?

23:54.967 --> 24:00.439
You're right. It isn't my dream.
It's Payson's.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.477
And who knows? Maybe
it is time to let it go.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.814
Because she's not
the best anymore?

24:09.048 --> 24:11.951
We've made a lot of
sacrifices, you included.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.055
What if she'll never
be what she was?

24:18.057 --> 24:21.728
Is it still all worth your dad
being in Minnesota

24:21.761 --> 24:24.564
and us being here?

24:24.597 --> 24:29.902
I guess not if you're only
pursuing your dream to be
the best, but...

24:29.936 --> 24:32.772
I thought gymnastics
was supposed to be fun

24:32.805 --> 24:35.041
and teach us about discipline
and hard work

24:35.074 --> 24:37.043
and all the stuff that
will take us far in life,

24:37.076 --> 24:39.045
no matter what we do.

24:40.547 --> 24:43.850
And what wise people said that?

24:43.883 --> 24:45.985
[chuckles]
You say it all the time.

24:48.087 --> 24:52.925
You know, we weren't always
the "all gymnastics
all the time" family.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.962
We used to have fun
doing other things.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.732
Remember how we'd go ice skating
at Grandma's every week
in the winter?

24:59.766 --> 25:02.001
- I miss that.
- Yeah, me too.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.541
No way. Absolutely not.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.843
Come on sweetie,
it's just one night!

25:10.877 --> 25:12.579
Well, then Brian can go.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.981
He's at computer camp
and you know that.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.985
Seriously, Mom. You're asking me
to have dinner with Mr. Tanner,

25:19.018 --> 25:22.054
his mother and Lauren?

25:22.088 --> 25:23.322
Are you hopped up
on those diet pills again?

25:23.355 --> 25:26.959
Honey, you're not getting it.
This is obviously a big deal.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.863
A man doesn't introduce you
to his mother unless it's
really serious.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.300
I mean, this is practically
the next step before commitment.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.102
Oh, my God.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.871
This actually means something
to you, doesn't it?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.340
You're serious about him.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.977
Honey, he wants me
to meet his mom.

25:45.011 --> 25:48.047
Nobody's ever introduced me
to their mother before.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.983
And I really, really want
to impress her.

25:51.017 --> 25:54.053
And let's face it. You're the
most impressive thing about me.
So, please, please?

25:54.086 --> 25:56.555
- OK.
- Oh, great!

25:58.090 --> 25:59.091
Bye.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.699
I cannot wait to see
what Gran makes of Chloe's...

26:06.733 --> 26:10.102
...interesting sense
of style and use of grammar.

26:10.136 --> 26:13.840
Chloe is a lovely woman
and Gran will enjoy her.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.608
If she doesn't drop dead
of a heart attack

26:15.642 --> 26:16.609
- the second she sees Chloe...
- [doorbell rings]

26:16.643 --> 26:18.711
...in one of her
Girls Gone Wild knockoffs.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.046
I'll get it!

26:28.921 --> 26:33.025
Chloe and Emily,
delighted to meet you.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.828
Goodness, Chloe, you're even
lovelier than Steve said!

26:39.431 --> 26:40.933
Please, come in.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.088
So, I owe you an apology.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.156
No, you were right.
I am selfish.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.959
And... You did give up
your whole life for me.

27:06.993 --> 27:11.163
Listen, the truth is, that
happened the day you were born.

27:11.197 --> 27:15.835
Because when you have children,
they become your life.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.971
And I wouldn't want it
any other way. I'm sorry, Pay.

27:19.005 --> 27:22.208
I was stressed. And I still
don't understand why

27:22.241 --> 27:25.678
you'd give up on your dream
when there's still a chance?

27:25.712 --> 27:27.814
Remember how much I used to
love ice skating when
I was little?

27:27.847 --> 27:29.448
Yes, you were great at this.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.017
You've always been
an amazing athlete.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.886
Exactly. I'm an athlete,
not a princess.

27:35.254 --> 27:40.226
When I was seven, I wanted
to be in the Great River Mall
Ice Capades show

27:40.259 --> 27:43.696
because I really, really
wanted to be the princess.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.197
I don't remember that.

27:45.231 --> 27:48.100
yeah, because I got
cast as the prince.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.169
Oh, that I remember.
I made you a great costume...

27:50.202 --> 27:55.107
- That's exactly the point, Mom!
- What?

27:55.141 --> 28:00.780
I got cast as the prince,
because the director said
I was built more like a boy.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.982
And then later I heard
all the girls laughing at me

28:03.015 --> 28:06.853
for even thinking I was
graceful enough or pretty enough

28:06.886 --> 28:08.988
to ever, ever be a princess.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.090
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.492
Because I knew you'd just
tell me the prince was
the cooler part

28:13.525 --> 28:17.163
instead of telling me
what I really wanted to hear.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.098
Which was?

28:19.131 --> 28:21.267
That they were all wrong

28:21.300 --> 28:24.737
and I would have been the most
beautiful princess in the world.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.273
And that's why you
want to give up?

28:27.306 --> 28:31.177
You don't think you're
graceful enough to be
a more artistic gymnast?

28:32.111 --> 28:35.748
- I'm scared, Mom.
- It's OK.

28:35.782 --> 28:39.018
It's OK to be scared
of trying something new.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.487
But if you don't try at all...

28:41.520 --> 28:44.190
...you could become scared
of your whole life.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.559
And one more thing.

28:47.593 --> 28:51.063
I think you would have made
the most beautiful princess
in the world.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.500
- And I still do.
- [Becca] Hey, grannies.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.302
Senior citizens skate at 5:00.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.004
Are we gonna let her
get away with that?!

28:58.037 --> 29:00.172
- Absolutely not.
- Come here!

29:07.947 --> 29:12.051
Well, the whole meal
was wonderful.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.887
Especially the "excargot."

29:14.921 --> 29:17.890
Escargot are snails.
You know that, right?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.358
[Chloe] Of course.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.095
Did you get them
out of your garden?

29:23.129 --> 29:28.968
No, but what a good idea with
the prices they're charging at
the gourmet markets these days.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.972
So where did you
go to school, Chloe?

29:33.005 --> 29:35.141
Um, Jefferson High
in Waco, Texas.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.944
But don't you
hold that against me.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.278
And after high school?

29:41.147 --> 29:43.015
I intended to go to college

29:43.049 --> 29:45.952
but circumstances weren't
in my favor.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.954
Circumstances?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.989
I think she means getting
knocked up with Emily.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.158
How old were you?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.995
Well, I was 18.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.832
Chloe is a marvelous mother,

29:59.866 --> 30:02.234
and Emily is the proof of that.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.236
Thank you, Mr. Tanner.

30:04.270 --> 30:07.239
She certainly is.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.241
Did you enjoy your
visit to France?

30:09.275 --> 30:13.112
I did. Emily got caught sneaking
out to see a boy in Paris

30:13.145 --> 30:14.847
and didn't get to compete.

30:14.881 --> 30:19.285
I was just visiting a friend
and I would have been back

30:19.318 --> 30:22.388
with plenty of time if I had
a round trip ticket like
I thought.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.957
Well, good for you, Emily.

30:24.991 --> 30:28.194
What a shame to go
to France and not see Paris.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.198
I wonder where dessert is?

30:34.233 --> 30:38.370
Well I'm delighted I got
to meet you and your
lovely daughter, Chloe.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.072
You have me to thank for that.

30:40.106 --> 30:42.208
Gran's visit's been
scheduled for weeks,

30:42.241 --> 30:44.643
but Dad didn't even
want to introduce you two,

30:44.676 --> 30:47.446
until I told Gran
about his newest girlfriend.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.149
Weeks?

30:50.182 --> 30:53.185
[Lauren] But that's men,
I guess.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.055
They don't want to bring
a woman home to meet mother

30:56.088 --> 30:58.190
unless she's the one.

31:03.329 --> 31:06.966
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tanner.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.368
You're gonna have to excuse us.

31:09.401 --> 31:12.304
I have to go to the gym
early in the morning,

31:12.338 --> 31:15.141
and I need to finish all
my schoolwork before bed.

31:16.308 --> 31:19.045
Thank you Mr. Tanner and Lauren.

31:19.078 --> 31:22.048
- Dinner was unforgettable.
- Yes. Thank you. It was.

31:22.081 --> 31:24.083
Wait, we can show ourselves out.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.089
So where is dessert?

31:35.227 --> 31:40.199
I told you, right? That woman
is a gold-digging disaster.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.969
There is nothing sadder
than a lady with no class.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.337
I know. And you should see
how she really dresses.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.339
Like the hoochie mama she is.

31:47.373 --> 31:53.079
Well... true class is
about having graciousness.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.214
No matter what.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.085
Even if someone is setting you
up, or undermining you.

31:59.118 --> 32:03.455
True class is exhibiting manners
when someone is trying to pull
you in the gutter.

32:05.024 --> 32:08.194
I saw two women
with real class tonight.

32:08.227 --> 32:11.197
And Lauren, the only person
at that table tonight

32:11.230 --> 32:14.266
who was truly tacky, was you.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.305
I understand you feel
abandoned by your mother

32:19.338 --> 32:23.309
and I know that's where
a lot of your anger comes from,

32:23.342 --> 32:26.078
but you are a Tanner,

32:26.112 --> 32:29.015
and the Tanners are,
above all, gracious,

32:29.048 --> 32:32.985
especially when hosting
people in their home.

32:33.019 --> 32:38.090
I would do you a disservice
if I didn't tell you how much
you disappointed me tonight.

32:47.566 --> 32:52.204
Ladies and gentleman...
may I please present

32:52.238 --> 32:57.243
your fair and unbiased
judges, assistant coaches,
Tarah and Jake!

32:57.276 --> 32:59.145
Now, we all know what's
at stake so...

32:59.178 --> 33:04.550
- Let's get ready to tumble!
- [cheering]

33:06.085 --> 33:07.253
Whoo!

33:09.788 --> 33:13.292
All right, ladies, this is
our gym and we are strong...

33:13.325 --> 33:18.130
And graceful and capable
of trying stuff that scares
us and kicking some serious ass!

33:18.164 --> 33:21.433
It's about time you
showed your face here.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.335
Yeah well, get used to it.

33:26.238 --> 33:29.241
- [all] Go Rock Girls, go!
- Whoo!

33:31.410 --> 33:33.479
I just wanted to say
good luck, and be careful.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.082
This really isn't worth
getting injured over.

33:36.115 --> 33:39.385
Back 'atcha. We saw you
practically neuter yourself

33:39.418 --> 33:42.354
- on the beam yesterday.
- [snickering]

33:42.388 --> 33:45.357
Well, may the best
men or women win.

33:47.093 --> 33:52.198
And first up on men's parallel
bars, we have Emily K-K-Kmetko!

33:52.231 --> 33:54.166
[cheering]

33:56.168 --> 33:58.137

34:12.651 --> 34:16.188
* I ain't gonna stop
Never gonna stop *

34:16.222 --> 34:19.425
* I ain't gonna stop
So keep it comin' *

34:19.458 --> 34:23.362
* I ain't gonna stop
Never gonna stop *

34:23.395 --> 34:25.264
- [crowd cheering]
- * So keep it comin'

34:30.436 --> 34:33.539
Next up, on the beam,
we have Austin Tucker!

34:33.572 --> 34:35.407
[rock music playing]

34:37.276 --> 34:39.545
We have so got this.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.614
Tear it up, Austin!

34:46.152 --> 34:50.088
* How many times
have they wasted? *

35:04.336 --> 35:07.539
* Count the times
they've counted you out *

35:07.573 --> 35:10.542
* Count the times
they've counted you out *

35:10.576 --> 35:14.146
* Count the times
they've counted you out *

35:14.180 --> 35:17.149
* Count the times
they've counted you out *

35:17.183 --> 35:19.885
* Sometimes I see it

35:19.918 --> 35:23.222
* Sometimes I feel it

35:23.255 --> 35:25.191
* Sometimes...

35:27.426 --> 35:29.261
You were saying?

35:37.603 --> 35:41.907
The women's uneven bars,
now being attempted
by Carter Anderson.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.543
[upbeat music playing]

35:52.484 --> 35:54.453
* You keep me runnin'

35:54.486 --> 35:57.256
* And I'm running out of time

35:57.289 --> 35:59.691
* Well I give you anything

35:59.725 --> 36:02.528
* If anything
would make you proud *

36:02.561 --> 36:05.464
* Let's kick it in

36:05.497 --> 36:08.234
* Let's kick it in

36:08.267 --> 36:10.369
* Do you feel it

36:10.402 --> 36:12.771
- * Do, do you feel it? *
- [cheering]

36:18.444 --> 36:20.412
That was pretty lame.
We're still in this.

36:20.446 --> 36:21.347
Get it, Lo.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.315
[Sasha] Let's see
if the queen of the beam

36:23.349 --> 36:24.516
can make the rings sing.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.319
It's Lauren Tanner,
on the men's rings.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.754
[rock music playing]

37:00.018 --> 37:02.421
[all cheering]

37:04.556 --> 37:06.625
Chloe, I'm an idiot.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.461
No, Steve, I'm the idiot.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.696
For dressing up like Jackie-O

37:10.729 --> 37:13.499
so you wouldn't be afraid of
what your mother thought of me.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.635
- And...
- I did it because
I was excited and touched

37:16.668 --> 37:18.804
that you wanted to introduce
me to your mother.

37:18.837 --> 37:23.275
- Because...
- I thought it meant you were
serious about me. And us.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.644
- Which...
- You clearly aren't.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.547
Which is the real reason you
don't want anyone around here
to know about us.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.482
- That's...
- Bull malarkey!

37:30.516 --> 37:32.718
Let me tell you something.
I am proud of who I am.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.620
I am proud of the way I dress.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.488
Because with me, what you
see is what you get.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.690
I am real and I am honest

37:38.724 --> 37:40.526
and you're lucky that
a woman like me

37:40.559 --> 37:41.693
would even give you
the time of day.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.498
What? What are you doing?

37:46.532 --> 37:49.301
[classical music playing]

37:49.335 --> 37:50.869
[laughter]

38:10.121 --> 38:11.790
- [cheering]
- Boom!

38:42.588 --> 38:43.722
Boom.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.624
OK, we can still win this.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.359
Bring it home, Kaylie.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.494
And don't blow it.

38:48.527 --> 38:51.463
I am not freezing my butt off
doing beam in the annex.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.898
[Sasha] Now, with
nothing to lose...

38:52.931 --> 38:55.601
- Go get 'em. Come on.
- ...is Kaylie Cruz!

38:55.634 --> 38:58.670
[rock music playing]

39:18.557 --> 39:20.559
[cheering]

39:52.458 --> 39:53.625
- [cheering]
- Whoo!

40:16.482 --> 40:19.851
Well, even if we don't beat
the boys, the good news is,

40:19.885 --> 40:23.188
you and I won't have to suffer
through any more family dinners.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.658
Just practice every day
in the gym, unfortunately.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.869
So the results are in,

40:37.903 --> 40:41.607
In the 2010 Rock Men
versus Rock Women,

40:41.640 --> 40:45.243
the winners and deciders
of where the high bar belongs,

40:45.276 --> 40:48.614
by a small margin...

40:48.647 --> 40:49.748
...is the Rock Men.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.917
- [men cheering]
- What?

40:53.685 --> 40:57.222
Excuse me! May I have
everyone's attention?

40:57.255 --> 41:02.561
This woman, Chloe Kmetko
and I, are dating,

41:02.594 --> 41:06.498
or I hope we're still dating,
because she is beautiful

41:06.532 --> 41:09.535
and smart and has true class

41:09.568 --> 41:13.639
and I want everyone to know,
I'm nuts about her!

41:17.776 --> 41:20.979
Will you give me
another chance? Please?

41:22.614 --> 41:25.784
Well, OK, but this
is the last one.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.756
[people cheering, hooting]

41:34.726 --> 41:37.729
I guess you were right,
people's types do change.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.668
[acoustic music playing]

41:42.701 --> 41:44.636
* It's coming down...

41:44.670 --> 41:48.607
Hey, where's the sportsmanship
around here?

41:48.640 --> 41:51.910
Etiquette calls for the loser
to shake the winner's hand.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.013
Look, I'm sorry.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.883
I'm a founding member
of this gym. I grew up here.

41:57.916 --> 42:01.553
We've worked really hard
and risked a lot to put
The Rock on the map.

42:01.587 --> 42:02.788
I know.

42:04.656 --> 42:05.791
That's why I'm here.

42:07.659 --> 42:10.762
The deal is, I'd been
getting a little scattered.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.665
I needed a little inspiration,

42:13.699 --> 42:16.602
so I came here, because
The Rock girls are it.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.972
You're it.
You girls are on fire.

42:21.006 --> 42:24.710
You're passionate
and determined and fearless.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.778
I could use a little
more of that these days.

42:27.646 --> 42:28.980
Right.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.716
How about a compromise?

42:30.749 --> 42:34.720
High bar stays in back, but
parallel bars stay in The Rock.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.657
That seems fair.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.761
[horn honks]

42:42.794 --> 42:44.863
Cool, see you tomorrow.

42:44.896 --> 42:49.735
* I wish you could see how
you've burned so bright *

42:49.768 --> 42:52.170
* This is your life

42:54.405 --> 42:57.108
Hey! What's everybody
doing tonight?

42:57.142 --> 42:59.911
Um... Kaylie asked us
over to commiserate.

42:59.945 --> 43:01.613
There's gonna be
ice cream involved.

43:01.647 --> 43:03.949
That's cool. I have plans
with Carter anyway.

43:03.982 --> 43:06.618
You guys can go
polish your promise rings

43:06.652 --> 43:08.654
or whatever it is you do
if you don't have a boyfriend.

43:08.687 --> 43:10.155
[chuckles] See ya!

43:14.425 --> 43:16.394
* 'Cause this is your life

43:16.427 --> 43:17.929
[Kaylie] Come on, guys.

43:17.963 --> 43:21.733
[girls laughing, chattering]

43:21.767 --> 43:25.671
* There's nothing here
to fight *

43:25.704 --> 43:30.909
* I wish you could see how
you burned so bright *

43:30.942 --> 43:33.845
* This is your life

43:33.879 --> 43:37.749
* Don't try to get it right

43:37.783 --> 43:41.787
* You've climbed
to such great heights *

43:41.820 --> 43:47.659
* And everyone sees
how you burned so bright *

43:47.693 --> 43:49.728
* This is your life

43:51.763 --> 43:53.832
* This is your life

43:55.466 --> 43:58.103
* This is your life *
