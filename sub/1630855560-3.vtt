the report from the drill site

39:17.746 --> 39:19.095
to the geological bureau--

39:19.226 --> 39:20.749
- Dillon Charley.

39:20.880 --> 39:23.578
- He was working
as a courier for Drumco.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.932
- Is there anything unusual
about the mineral content?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.456
- Not a thing.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.327
Um, the oil was tapped out.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.850
Traces of uranium were found,

39:34.981 --> 39:36.635
but according to the state,
it was not recoverable--

39:36.765 --> 39:38.637

the expenses

39:38.767 --> 39:40.726

39:40.856 --> 39:43.990
So with no oil
and no recoverable uranium,

no uranium there,

39:57.569 --> 39:59.353
