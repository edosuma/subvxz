46:12.522 --> 46:14.149
[chuckling] ...although
a hopeless endeavor,

46:14.274 --> 46:18.820
is almost as impressive
as your lack of self-awareness.

And finally, and this is
what I do admire most,

46:22.323 --> 46:27.245

an even bigger narcissist
than I could ever be.

want to be you anymore.

Immortimas is
just another prison.

47:29.516 --> 47:31.476
It's another lie.

47:31.559 --> 47:34.062
And I'm done lying to myself.

I'm 100 years old,
for God's sake,
and I'm still hiding.

47:39.025 --> 47:42.487
I have never
lived out in the real world.

47:43.863 --> 47:46.032
I can't lock myself
away anymore.

47:47.283 --> 47:48.410
I need to go.

47:53.289 --> 47:54.499
Then I'll go with you.

47:55.208 --> 47:56.501
What?

47:56.584 --> 47:59.170
So, that's three votes
to leave Immortimas.

That... that's not
what she means.

48:12.100 --> 48:16.938
I'm just saying that...
I thought I found
a new adventure here.

48:18.189 --> 48:19.524
A new experience.

48:20.608 --> 48:21.901
Clearly I was wrong.

48:23.528 --> 48:25.155
If I'm going to be
a hero in the real world,

48:25.280 --> 48:26.948
I need to see the real world.

48:27.073 --> 48:28.616
No, come on.

catch a break?

as perfect can be.

saying the things
that we all are thinking.

with myself...
-Fuck me.

being written for me.

-You were right all along.
-[Larry sighs]

48:56.227 --> 48:58.313
I don't want to live
in a fake world either.

48:58.438 --> 48:59.689
How can I know
what I truly want,

48:59.814 --> 49:03.318
when people
keep rewriting my backstory?

49:03.401 --> 49:06.154
How can I trust my feelings
when I don't even
know who I am?

49:08.073 --> 49:09.949
I need to write
my own story for once.

49:10.867 --> 49:12.410
You wanna leave?

49:12.494 --> 49:14.996
But you said... [sighs]

I don't want you to leave.

49:18.124 --> 49:20.085
He's not with us either.

49:20.168 --> 49:22.504
That's four votes.
