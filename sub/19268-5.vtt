00:16.920 --> 00:20.110
<i>Mr. Park had called him into this house the night before the crime. </i>

00:20.110 --> 00:23.320
<i>And we confirmed his face with the witness. </i>

00:23.320 --> 00:25.320
<i>The thing about gambling addicts... </i>

00:25.320 --> 00:27.180
<i>They care more about gambling.
That's the scary thing. </i>

00:27.180 --> 00:29.760
<i>If you already got the money,
why did you go back? </i>

00:29.760 --> 00:31.760
<i>Stop lying, you bastard! </i>

00:31.760 --> 00:32.890
<i>Hey punk! </i>

00:33.390 --> 00:34.470
<i>What are you doing here? </i>

00:34.470 --> 00:35.580
<i>It's been a year. </i>

00:35.580 --> 00:38.080
<i>You're still the same.
Director Yeo. </i>

00:38.080 --> 00:39.920
<i>We've been doing this the wrong way. </i>

00:39.920 --> 00:42.510
<i>Kang Jong Yoon isn't the criminal.
He was framed. </i>

00:42.510 --> 00:44.660
<i>The one wanting revenge against Im Do Sool... </i>

00:44.660 --> 00:46.490
<i>The one who likes Cheval Blanc... </i>

00:47.060 --> 00:48.490
<i>I'll go my own way. </i>

00:50.560 --> 00:55.250
<i>5 hundred million!
You broke into the safe. </i>

00:56.660 --> 00:58.750
<i>What if the victim messed with the brother's wife? </i>

00:58.750 --> 01:01.460
<i>Im Min Sub.
Where is he right now? </i>

01:04.090 --> 01:05.040
<i>Im Min Sub! </i>

01:05.040 --> 01:06.320
<i>What happened, Im Min Sub? </i>

01:06.320 --> 01:09.050
<i>Kang.. Jong... Yoon... </i>

01:09.050 --> 01:10.060
<i>Kang Jong Yoon? </i>

01:35.030 --> 01:37.070
How is the patient's condition? 

01:37.070 --> 01:40.250
He's passed the critical care but still hasn't gained consciousness. 

01:46.800 --> 01:49.220
Im Do Sool had 5 hundred million dollars in cash at his house. 

01:49.220 --> 01:51.220
The 5 hundred million he collected three years ago. 

01:51.940 --> 01:56.660
5 hundred million at the crime scene that the police didn't even know about... 

01:56.660 --> 01:59.320
Isn't this obviously Kang Jong Yoon's motive? 

02:00.180 --> 02:04.380
He didn't kill the wife and daughter first to get revenge. 

02:04.380 --> 02:07.010
He did it to try to get the password. 

02:07.010 --> 02:08.750
What do you think Director Yeo? 

02:11.920 --> 02:13.010
And... 

02:14.000 --> 02:18.110
Im Min Sub isn't looking for Kang Jong Yoon to get revenge on his brother. 

02:19.530 --> 02:21.540
He's trying to get that money. 

02:22.390 --> 02:24.160
He knows the safe is empty. 

02:25.760 --> 02:27.810
In Kang Jong Yoon's perspective... 

02:27.810 --> 02:31.490
If you remove the only other person who knows about the money... 

02:31.490 --> 02:34.320
Getting the 5 hundred million is no problem. 

02:35.880 --> 02:37.390
That's why he picked him. 

02:39.690 --> 02:41.700
That little devil... 

02:44.940 --> 02:47.920
You almost got fooled by Kang Jong Yoon's show. 

02:47.920 --> 02:49.920
I told you, right? 

02:50.730 --> 02:53.140
This is a place you won't ever understand. 

02:55.450 --> 02:56.640
Hell. 

03:00.730 --> 03:01.830
Senior! 

03:01.830 --> 03:04.030
We just got a witness top about Kang Jong Yoon! 

03:04.850 --> 03:07.390
Hey! Call your families and tell them you'll be gone for 3 days. 

03:07.390 --> 03:08.640
Yes! 

03:15.790 --> 03:19.040
We already confirmed Im Min Sub's alibi during the crime. 

03:19.040 --> 03:21.440
Between the witnesses and camera footage, there's no missing gap. 

03:22.540 --> 03:27.080
Director, do you think Im Min Sub is perhaps Kang Jong Yoon's accomplice? 

03:27.080 --> 03:30.220
Im Min Sub gave Kang Jong Yoon the money and made him kill his brother. 

03:30.220 --> 03:33.740
But because of the 5 hundred million,
Kang Jong Yoon just went nuts! 

03:33.740 --> 03:35.340
Excuse me, Detective! 

03:36.120 --> 03:37.120
Here. 

03:37.960 --> 03:40.640
This was found inside the patient's clothes. 

03:51.000 --> 03:54.540
Why would Im Min Sub only keep the photo around? 

04:01.140 --> 04:02.970
We've been doing this the wrong way. 

04:02.970 --> 04:06.000
Kang Jong Yoon isn't the criminal.
He was framed. 

04:06.000 --> 04:08.570
And he's looking for the real killer right now. 

04:08.570 --> 04:09.610
Wait. 

04:10.850 --> 04:12.250
So... 

04:12.250 --> 04:17.010
So you're saying it wasn't that gambler but someone else? 

04:18.240 --> 04:22.240
Im Min Sub, who's been looking for the money more than anybody else... 

04:22.240 --> 04:26.310
...realized that Kang Jong Yoon might not be the murderer. 

04:26.310 --> 04:31.110
Since then, Im Min Sub changed his tactic on finding the real culprit. 

04:31.110 --> 04:34.410
So, Im Min Sub probably thought that there might be someone... 

04:34.410 --> 04:37.570
...in these photos that would want to kill Im Do Sool. 

04:38.870 --> 04:40.900
But what kind of photo is this? 

04:43.130 --> 04:46.000
One of the photos he kept without Im Do Sool knowing. 

04:54.260 --> 04:55.620
Yeah? 

04:55.620 --> 04:57.310
<i>I heard the news. </i>

04:57.310 --> 04:59.750
I guess there comes a day where even Yeo Ji Hoon gets stuck. 

04:59.750 --> 05:02.090
I don't think it's time to be getting pity calls yet. 

05:02.090 --> 05:04.680
Come over here.
I have something to show you. 

05:08.170 --> 05:09.870
I'll be at the autopsy center. 

05:09.870 --> 05:12.470
You, go find the identities of these women in the photos. 

05:12.470 --> 05:13.550
Yes! 

05:18.240 --> 05:20.490
This was found in the wife's large intestine. 

05:21.980 --> 05:26.050
After biting and swallowing this,
she broke her teeth. 

05:26.050 --> 05:30.350
Was she trying to make a last ditch effort to leave traces of the criminal? 

05:31.280 --> 05:33.600
There are no other traces. 

05:33.600 --> 05:36.250
Although it was a very small amount in the reagent... 

05:36.250 --> 05:38.250
...there were traces of formalin found in the body. 

05:39.300 --> 05:40.860
Formalin? 

05:40.860 --> 05:42.400
But that's poison. 

05:42.400 --> 05:44.930
Examiner's dilute it and use it for disinfection. 

05:44.930 --> 05:48.540
For example... in the operating room? 

05:55.350 --> 05:57.030
In any case... 

05:57.660 --> 06:02.390
The key is completely unrelated to gambling or stabbing. 

06:12.020 --> 06:14.390
He put the knife here... 

06:15.060 --> 06:17.790
...and forced me to pull the shutter down. 

06:32.540 --> 06:34.630
- Hello?
- Hello? 

06:35.410 --> 06:36.910
<i>Who is this? </i>

06:39.950 --> 06:41.700
Hang in there. 

07:00.860 --> 07:02.420
They're not picking up... 

07:02.420 --> 07:03.560
<i>Hello? </i>

07:05.300 --> 07:07.950
<i>Hello? Speak up. </i>

07:10.100 --> 07:14.120
And then he... went into the bathroom... 

07:14.120 --> 07:16.410
He was on the phone for a while. 

07:19.800 --> 07:20.800
Thank you. 

07:25.400 --> 07:28.670
If he was calling people out of a book... 

07:28.670 --> 07:31.260
Doesn't that mean he's still looking for somebody over there? 

07:31.260 --> 07:32.340
Right. 

07:33.830 --> 07:38.660
Why is this bastard still acting like he's trying to find the criminal? 

07:38.660 --> 07:42.090
Senior... I don't know the reason why but... 

07:42.090 --> 07:46.270
I think he's really trying to find who killed Im Do Sool. 

07:46.270 --> 07:48.270
The man who killed Im Do Sool... 

07:51.420 --> 07:57.150
He's looking for the man who killed Im Do Sool... 

08:00.840 --> 08:05.140
Find out every number that was called from this phone. 

08:05.140 --> 08:07.140
I'll be back. 

08:09.510 --> 08:11.010
Every number? 

08:27.740 --> 08:29.730
Miss Kim~ 

08:32.059 --> 08:34.720
We only take 10% interest paid in advance. 

08:34.720 --> 08:37.230
Call me if you're interested. 

08:37.230 --> 08:39.669
What's wrong? 

08:39.669 --> 08:41.320
Were you sad all this time? 

08:42.030 --> 08:43.200
Look at me. 

08:43.200 --> 08:44.350
Why?

08:44.970 --> 08:46.900
Look at me. 

09:07.530 --> 09:10.230
Ugh, these idiots. 

09:10.230 --> 09:12.230
They mixed kimchi into this. 

09:13.710 --> 09:15.680
Have you not been eating well? 

09:15.680 --> 09:18.660
Life has its ups and downs. 

09:19.500 --> 09:22.230
You haven't seen me all this time.
Why now? 

09:26.750 --> 09:28.170
You know Im Do Sool, right? 

09:29.280 --> 09:32.430
Who would want to kill Im Do Sool? 

09:32.430 --> 09:34.320
Isn't that case closed already? 

09:34.320 --> 09:35.550
That gambler. 

09:35.550 --> 09:39.650
But for some reason,
that gambler is looking for the killer. 

09:40.330 --> 09:41.910
Makes sense. 

09:41.910 --> 09:44.500
Being murdered by a thief... 

09:44.500 --> 09:47.460
...and ending his life that way is kind of bland. 

09:52.240 --> 09:53.430
What does that mean? 

09:55.070 --> 09:57.130
Do you know what Im Do Sool's nickname was? 

09:57.130 --> 09:58.060
What? 

09:59.530 --> 10:00.840
Pig. 

10:00.840 --> 10:02.010
Pig? 

10:03.240 --> 10:04.260
Why? 

10:04.740 --> 10:07.070
I guess you've never raised pigs before, Detective Viper. 

10:07.510 --> 10:10.470
Most loan sharks take your house or car first. 

10:10.470 --> 10:13.690
But that man pulls your zipper down first. 

10:13.690 --> 10:16.440
Horny pig. 

10:17.970 --> 10:19.660
Horny pig? 

10:26.920 --> 10:28.960
I guess there are a lot of people who would turn a blind eye... 

10:28.960 --> 10:30.840
...even if they saw Kang Jong Yoon. 

10:30.840 --> 10:34.300
There's no loyalty like that around here! 

10:34.300 --> 10:37.710
People will do anything for just a few bucks! 

10:37.710 --> 10:39.900
Then, why is everyone so hush-hush? 

10:39.900 --> 10:45.470
Im Min Sub declared that Kang Jong Yoon was his after his brother died. 

10:46.340 --> 10:47.470
Im Min Sub? 

10:48.980 --> 10:50.730
Im Do Sool's younger brother? 

10:51.510 --> 10:57.910
The reason why nobody came after the pig was because of his bastard brother. 

10:59.290 --> 11:00.440
Scary world. 

11:08.420 --> 11:12.050
[Pigs] 

11:14.990 --> 11:16.680
Let's see here... 

11:16.680 --> 11:19.140
Let's get their personal information. 

11:21.430 --> 11:23.700
What's this? Pig? 

11:25.300 --> 11:26.340
Pig? 

11:30.880 --> 11:33.070
50-something year old. 

11:33.070 --> 11:36.570
If he has beginner level computer skills... 

11:36.570 --> 11:39.210
The standard, 1 2 3 4. 

11:40.850 --> 11:43.180
Did I make it too easy? 

11:44.810 --> 11:47.420
Then... 4 3 2 1. 

11:55.420 --> 11:56.790
What's this? 

12:03.060 --> 12:04.030
Yeah? 

12:04.030 --> 12:05.320
Director! 

12:05.320 --> 12:08.720
Im Do Sool is a total animal who just looks human. 

12:09.580 --> 12:14.620
All the women in the photos were in debt to Im Do Sool. 

12:14.620 --> 12:17.390
He must've used their debt as bait to sexually abuse them. 

12:18.380 --> 12:22.990
There's photos for every interest payment and principal payment dates. 

12:23.940 --> 12:25.980
Looks like he had disgusting taste. 

12:26.950 --> 12:29.260
I think I found the motive. 

12:30.430 --> 12:32.220
In addition to the women in the photos... 

12:32.220 --> 12:35.570
Find anyone associated and see what they were doing during the crime. 

12:36.070 --> 12:38.040
- Yes.
- Oh and... 

12:38.040 --> 12:41.440
Send me the addresses of the women in Im Min Sub's photo. 

12:44.870 --> 12:50.100
If the person closest to Im Do Sool even pointed out this woman... 

12:51.100 --> 12:52.890
There must be a reason. 

12:56.640 --> 13:00.220
Please just confirm this for me. 

13:01.330 --> 13:02.500
Look here. 

13:02.500 --> 13:06.240
We have dozens of missing persons reports. 

13:06.770 --> 13:08.840
This is clearly a runaway. 

13:08.840 --> 13:11.190
This isn't a simple runaway. 

13:14.260 --> 13:16.640
This is our specialty! 

13:16.640 --> 13:19.810
Child, don't cry.
Your mom will be here soon. 

13:20.920 --> 13:22.600
Soo Yeon! 

13:22.600 --> 13:25.630
Soo Yeon! Are you okay? 

13:27.550 --> 13:29.050
Are you okay? 

13:32.640 --> 13:34.730
I thought she was in the car... 

13:34.730 --> 13:36.100
Thank you. 

13:36.100 --> 13:39.360
If it wasn't for this,
we'd be in trouble. 

13:39.360 --> 13:41.820
She's wearing the same necklace. 

13:41.820 --> 13:44.750
Excuse me. What's that? 

13:46.600 --> 13:48.570
Lost child prevention receiver. 

14:05.260 --> 14:06.820
Is this Jung Hyun Sook's house? 

14:07.660 --> 14:09.050
Who are you? 

14:12.080 --> 14:13.260
I'm from the police. 

14:13.890 --> 14:15.880
There's something I need to investigate. 

14:15.880 --> 14:17.680
Where were you on April 2nd? 

14:19.170 --> 14:23.540
It wasn't even enough for his crotch... 

14:24.070 --> 14:26.190
And now he brings the police? 

14:29.180 --> 14:32.070
Yes! I killed him! 

14:32.720 --> 14:37.530
I killed his entire family!
So what! 

14:45.010 --> 14:47.380
She said her name was Hong Jung Im. 

14:47.380 --> 14:50.000
I don't think she was from around here. 

14:51.120 --> 14:53.910
I don't know other people's business. 

14:54.950 --> 14:56.470
Because I did it too. 

15:01.260 --> 15:06.610
Your debt is piling up.
What took you so long to come? 

15:08.440 --> 15:10.500
Same for the dealer bastard. 

15:10.500 --> 15:13.910
If someone as pretty as you came,
he should've helped you out. 

15:17.960 --> 15:20.100
Let me borrow one more. 

15:21.940 --> 15:23.340
Collateral? 

15:24.790 --> 15:26.670
I'll repay it right away. 

15:26.670 --> 15:28.510
Let me go this once. 

15:29.250 --> 15:31.130
Then... 

15:31.130 --> 15:33.400
Do you want me to inject you? 

15:34.670 --> 15:36.580
I'll give you one more stack. 

15:48.100 --> 15:51.930
You have one collateral left. 

15:57.700 --> 15:59.190
Crazy bastard. 

16:08.030 --> 16:10.150
Go make some coffee. 

16:12.160 --> 16:14.610
I don't want coffee. 

16:16.490 --> 16:18.960
She just told you to shut it! 

16:40.710 --> 16:43.630
If you need more, just come back. 

16:50.200 --> 16:54.460
She fell into the pigs' trap. 

16:57.850 --> 17:01.070
The next time I saw her was at a casino. 

17:17.940 --> 17:19.280
Unni. 

17:20.750 --> 17:24.040
You know me, right?
We met before. 

17:24.040 --> 17:26.800
We met at Mr. Im's office. 

17:29.750 --> 17:31.860
Did you win anything? 

17:31.860 --> 17:34.760
Do you have $100? 

17:35.650 --> 17:37.850
Or even $50... 

17:38.670 --> 17:40.250
Unni! 

17:40.250 --> 17:42.460
If I don't repay it by today... 

17:43.220 --> 17:46.130
I have to go back to those bastards. 

17:47.220 --> 17:49.830
You can't ever escape from those bastards. 

17:50.810 --> 17:52.000
Just go home. 

17:55.350 --> 17:56.930
A long time ago... 

17:58.160 --> 18:05.250
I used to think that once you entered hell, you could never escape. 

18:05.250 --> 18:07.130
But now that I look at it... 

18:07.130 --> 18:10.830
The doors of hell were always slightly opened... 

18:13.310 --> 18:15.350
It's not that you can't leave... 

18:16.540 --> 18:18.810
You won't leave. 

18:20.970 --> 18:22.720
I know you know that too. 

18:34.830 --> 18:39.710
Soon after, her husband came to look for those guys. 

19:03.890 --> 19:05.600
That was the last time I saw her. 

19:06.440 --> 19:09.790
I heard she committed suicide at a mental hospital. 

19:11.780 --> 19:12.840
Suicide? 

19:14.890 --> 19:17.640
Do you know her husband's occupation by any chance? 

19:21.550 --> 19:23.280
I think he was a Doctor. 

19:27.910 --> 19:28.880
Thank you. 

19:40.060 --> 19:43.290
Name: Hong Jung Im
Age: mid-30s. 

19:43.290 --> 19:46.720
Her husband is a prime suspect.
Go investigate. 

19:52.240 --> 19:52.730
Yeah? 

19:52.730 --> 19:53.620
Senior. 

19:53.620 --> 19:56.190
We found the identity of the last person Kang Jong Yoon called. 

19:56.190 --> 20:00.760
But, because it's not verified yet,
I think we have to go to that address. 

20:00.760 --> 20:04.210
Okay. Got it.
Text me the address. 

20:10.210 --> 20:13.100
This address stops at this intersection. 

20:13.100 --> 20:15.100
Do you want to get off? 

20:16.210 --> 20:18.140
- Intersection?
- Yes. 

20:49.880 --> 20:51.550
Yeh Ri! 

20:51.550 --> 20:54.160
What brings you here? 

20:54.160 --> 20:56.020
Min Ho... 

20:56.020 --> 20:57.660
Director... 

20:57.660 --> 20:59.590
What are you doing here? 

20:59.590 --> 21:01.590
Aren't you supposed to be investigating the family? 

21:02.700 --> 21:04.090
Yes... 

21:04.090 --> 21:09.970
This is the last place Kang Jong Yoon's daughter's receiver was found. 

21:09.970 --> 21:13.000
But, why are the two of you here... 

22:29.670 --> 22:30.710
Director. 

22:40.050 --> 22:41.950
This is Minji's necklace. 

23:06.060 --> 23:09.260
We got a call saying that Lee Sun Ho isn't home... 

23:14.190 --> 23:15.530
Detective Baek! 

23:19.360 --> 23:22.140
The one I've been waiting for,
Kang Jong Yoon doesn't show up. 

23:22.140 --> 23:24.070
Instead, I get uninvited guests. 

23:25.260 --> 23:28.630
Detective Baek!
What are you doing here? 

23:28.630 --> 23:30.510
That's what I'm saying. 

23:30.510 --> 23:36.610
Kang Jong Yoon is trying to find Im Do Sool's murderer. 

23:36.610 --> 23:37.810
I guess that place is here. 

23:42.230 --> 23:44.740
I see you found Cheval Blanc. 

23:47.290 --> 23:49.170
Again with that Cheval thing... 

23:49.170 --> 23:51.380
If you came to find Lee Sun Ho,
you're wasting your time. 

23:51.380 --> 23:53.170
He's been missing since this morning. 

23:56.400 --> 23:59.730
Lee Sun Ho is the true culprit of the family murder. 

23:59.730 --> 24:03.140
Two months ago, his wife, Hong Jung Im committed suicide. 

24:03.140 --> 24:06.620
All the assets including the hospital were given to Im Do Sool's brother. 

24:06.620 --> 24:10.190
He knows that if he were to speak up, he'd be accused. 

24:10.190 --> 24:12.920
So he found someone else to take the blame. 

24:14.410 --> 24:17.070
My thoughts are completely different. 

24:17.070 --> 24:22.130
I was sitting here wondering why Kang would keep playing innocent. 

24:22.130 --> 24:26.860
There's only one way for Kang Jong Yoon to get away with stealing 5 hundred million. 

24:26.860 --> 24:32.070
He wanted to kill Im Do Sool and Im Min Sub and framed it on a crazy guy. 

24:32.530 --> 24:36.110
And who fits that description?
Lee Sun Ho. 

24:36.110 --> 24:38.410
Isn't it interesting? 

24:38.410 --> 24:42.170
After Kang Jong Yoon finds Lee Sun Ho, he becomes missing. 

24:42.170 --> 24:46.620
The key to this hospital was found inside Im Do Sool's wife's body. 

24:46.620 --> 24:48.660
That means Lee Sun Ho was present at the crime scene. 

24:48.660 --> 24:50.950
I thought I told you... 

24:50.950 --> 24:54.130
Getting someone else's keys is nothing for a guy like Kang Jong Yoon. 

24:54.130 --> 24:56.610
I don't know why you're acting like this! 

24:56.610 --> 24:59.680
I agree! I don't know why you're acting like this either! 

24:59.680 --> 25:01.970
You saw how Im Min Sub died with your own eyes! 

25:02.950 --> 25:05.050
It was Kang Jong Yoon! 

25:06.110 --> 25:07.050
That... 

25:08.890 --> 25:12.160
I think Lee Sun Ho held Kang Jong Yoon's wife and daughter hostage and... 

25:12.160 --> 25:14.620
...and forced him to commit the murder. 

25:14.620 --> 25:17.850
There's proof that Kang Jong Yoon's family was kidnapped here. 

25:18.650 --> 25:23.230
This was Lee Sun Ho's revenge on the brothers abusing his wife. 

25:23.230 --> 25:30.020
Since he framed Kang, he needed to prove that he was the suspect. 

25:36.200 --> 25:40.980
Of course, the Ten team figures it out just like that! 

25:40.980 --> 25:44.940
He killed Im Min Sub to save his family after being forced to kill? 

25:44.940 --> 25:49.150
If he wanted to save his family,
wouldn't he have just called the police? 

25:49.150 --> 25:51.860
But there were no phone records.
And... 

25:53.590 --> 25:55.580
What happened to the 5 hundred million? 

25:56.440 --> 26:00.180
Why would someone who was framed run away with 5 hundred million? 

26:00.180 --> 26:05.460
There's no concrete evidence that Kang Jong Yoon has that money. 

26:16.080 --> 26:17.910
Let's stop with the wordplay. 

26:17.910 --> 26:22.410
There are many things about Kang Jong Yoon's behavior I don't understand. 

26:22.410 --> 26:24.810
But I'm wondering if I even have to understand everything. 

26:25.910 --> 26:28.030
I went through a meaningful experience last year. 

26:29.130 --> 26:33.050
To understand everything about someone is a lie. 

26:34.580 --> 26:35.820
Detective Baek! 

26:36.660 --> 26:38.630
So I gave up on trying to understand. 

26:39.400 --> 26:41.910
I'd rather catch them and ask them myself. 

26:42.890 --> 26:45.680
Let's not sit here and try to understand each other. 

26:45.680 --> 26:49.630
Let's just go our on way. 

26:49.630 --> 26:51.340
Director Yeo. Okay? 

26:56.470 --> 26:58.860
It's been a while since we all met but it feels weird. 

27:00.080 --> 27:02.220
Call me after this case gets solved. 

27:02.220 --> 27:03.840
I'll treat you out. 

28:26.980 --> 28:31.470
Just because his wife committed suicide... this guy sure is crazy. 

28:31.470 --> 28:32.900
He wasn't crazy. 

28:34.200 --> 28:36.530
Lee Sun Ho is a coldblooded human being. 

28:37.360 --> 28:40.710
In order to accomplish his goal,
not covering his ways and means. 

28:42.720 --> 28:47.820
Now that his revenge is done,
do you think he'll return the family? 

28:47.820 --> 28:48.990
Not sure. 

28:49.750 --> 28:53.920
If he knows he's a suspect,
it might be more dangerous for the family. 

28:54.910 --> 28:57.680
It's imperative that we find Lee Sun Ho secretly. 

28:57.680 --> 28:59.350
What about Kang Jong Yoon? 

28:59.350 --> 29:03.580
For a guy who's been framed,
his actions are questionable like Detective Baek said. 

29:04.710 --> 29:07.370
Kang Jong Yoon will be taken care of Detective Baek. 

29:12.900 --> 29:14.550
But... 

29:14.550 --> 29:17.330
Why did it have to be Kang Jong Yoon exactly? 

29:17.330 --> 29:22.310
Even before the crime, there was a planned approach towards Kang's family. 

29:23.020 --> 29:24.490
That's right. 

29:24.490 --> 29:28.080
According to the gambler who called Kang Jong Yoon out that night... 

29:28.080 --> 29:31.610
Lee Sun Ho targeted Kang Jong Yoon from the beginning. 

29:32.670 --> 29:35.890
Nam Yeh Ri, look further into Lee Sun Ho and Kang Jong Yoon's relationship. 

29:35.890 --> 29:40.490
If there's a reason why he had Kang Jong Yoon framed specifically... 

30:08.390 --> 30:09.530
Senior! 

30:10.050 --> 30:12.320
Kang Jong Yoon was last seen at a computer lab! 

30:13.530 --> 30:14.530
Computer lab? 

30:14.530 --> 30:15.500
Yes. 

30:15.500 --> 30:17.340
Nothing out of the ordinary but... 

30:17.340 --> 30:20.410
He was looking for a person on a site called Naricom. 

30:20.410 --> 30:21.850
Naricom? 

30:23.090 --> 30:24.640
If it's Naricom... 

30:25.680 --> 30:28.300
That's the company Kang Jong Yoon used to work with... 

30:30.920 --> 30:32.150
Where's that computer lab? 

30:57.840 --> 30:59.350
Director! 

31:02.500 --> 31:03.700
Director. 

31:03.700 --> 31:06.030
Lee Sun Ho was driving a rental car all day yesterday. 

31:06.030 --> 31:09.420
According to a witness, a woman and a child around 6 was in the car. 

31:13.680 --> 31:15.650
You two used to work together? 

31:15.650 --> 31:17.080
Yes. 

31:17.080 --> 31:20.280
But I don't know anything about this stabbing- 

31:21.510 --> 31:25.290
He just asked if I could locate a cell phone number. 

31:25.290 --> 31:27.200
That's all I did for him. 

31:27.200 --> 31:28.910
And? 

31:28.910 --> 31:31.800
He asked if I could lend him a prepaid phone. 

31:32.500 --> 31:33.550
Number? 

31:35.410 --> 31:39.720
011-379-6800 

31:39.720 --> 31:40.560
Are you sure? 

31:40.560 --> 31:41.620
Yes. 

31:47.480 --> 31:49.560
How unfortunate for someone who's so good with technology. 

31:50.480 --> 31:53.380
Assisting a fleeing criminal,
violation of illegal communication. 

31:53.380 --> 31:55.410
That's a good 3 years for you. 

31:56.480 --> 31:59.310
Save me, Detective! 

32:01.510 --> 32:04.410
Then, make another one identical to the one you made Kang Jong Yoon. 

32:05.270 --> 32:07.650
You said you could locate a replicated phone number. 

32:33.580 --> 32:34.640
Director! 

32:35.400 --> 32:38.720
According to the rental shop,
that car has a service of 40 km. 

32:40.320 --> 32:42.980
From the rental shop to here is 20 km. 

32:44.000 --> 32:47.260
Then, where could he have gone with the other 20 km. 

33:14.490 --> 33:17.770
How many stables are within 20 km from here? 

33:17.770 --> 33:19.330
Stables? 

33:19.330 --> 33:23.270
There's a good chance that the wife and child were taken to a stable. 

33:25.450 --> 33:27.290
I'll request search support! 

33:38.290 --> 33:41.060
Home, school, work... 

33:41.750 --> 33:43.720
Their lifestyle is different too... 

33:45.080 --> 33:48.560
They would have no reason to meet. 

33:51.160 --> 33:55.940
But why would Lee Sun Ho pick Kang Jong Yoon? 

35:03.400 --> 35:05.970
October 21, 2007. 

35:07.310 --> 35:10.540
October 21, 2007. 

35:25.430 --> 35:27.230
Thanks to you,
we had a great time. 

35:27.230 --> 35:31.470
My wife went to the casino for the first time and she was so happy when she hit the jackpot. 

35:31.470 --> 35:34.190
Meeting you has brought our family good luck. 

35:34.190 --> 35:35.640
May happiness always be with you. 

35:36.550 --> 35:38.380
Lee Sun Ho. 

35:44.200 --> 35:48.310
Thanks to you...
my wife went for the first time... 

35:56.890 --> 35:59.060
First time! 

36:12.720 --> 36:13.780
<i>Director! </i>

36:13.780 --> 36:17.450
I think I know why Lee Sun Ho dragged Kang Jong Yoon into this case! 

36:17.450 --> 36:21.430
Kang was the first person to drag Hong Jung Im into a casino 6 years ago. 

36:21.430 --> 36:24.890
Lee Sun Ho thinks that that was the beginning of this nightmare. 

36:25.670 --> 36:27.190
Beginning of the nightmare? 

36:27.190 --> 36:30.620
Coincidentally, the day of Kang's honeymoon... 

36:30.620 --> 36:33.740
<i>...was Hong Jung Im's first time at the casino. </i>

36:33.740 --> 36:35.450
<i>Thanks to you,
we had a great time. </i>

36:35.450 --> 36:39.830
<i>My wife went to the casino for the first time and she was so happy when she hit the jackpot. </i>

36:39.830 --> 36:43.270
Lee Sun Ho wrote this on a photo himself. 

36:43.710 --> 36:44.960
So... 

36:44.960 --> 36:50.320
Kidnapping Kim Eun Joo and the child was a revenge from the start? 

37:03.530 --> 37:04.740
Director. 

37:04.740 --> 37:08.760
Shouldn't we turn the kidnapping over to public investigation now? 

37:08.760 --> 37:12.140
If he kidnapped those people for revenge... 

37:13.220 --> 37:15.430
He might've already murdered them... 

37:17.630 --> 37:18.500
No. 

37:19.210 --> 37:20.550
They're still alive. 

37:22.520 --> 37:25.700
Until he meets Kang Jong Yoon,
they'll be alive. 

37:27.040 --> 37:31.550
The reason why Lee Sun Ho is calling Kang Jong Yoon is to torment him. 

37:32.920 --> 37:37.390
So he can see his family die in front of his eyes... torment... 

37:52.080 --> 37:53.030
What's going on? 

37:53.030 --> 37:55.100
Just an inspection.
Please open up the back. 

39:23.620 --> 39:27.040
Where are they?
I did everything you asked. 

39:27.040 --> 39:30.180
<i>I thought I told you not to tell the police. </i>

39:30.180 --> 39:33.790
It wasn't me.
Where's Minji and Eun Joo? 

39:33.790 --> 39:35.360
<i>Who knows. </i>

39:35.360 --> 39:37.200
<i>Where could they be? </i>

39:39.470 --> 39:42.710
What happened to your wife...
You know it's not my fault! 

39:47.840 --> 39:49.100
<i>Right. </i>

39:49.100 --> 39:51.060
<i>It's not your fault. </i>

39:51.060 --> 39:52.790
<i>It's nobody's fault. </i>

39:53.500 --> 39:55.280
Then, why are you doing this to me? 

39:58.800 --> 40:01.140
<i>I have something to give you. </i>

40:02.350 --> 40:03.600
<i>Torture. </i>

40:05.570 --> 40:07.650
Where's Minji and Eunjoo, you bastard? 

40:09.640 --> 40:11.620
<i>Where do you think they'd be? </i>

40:15.080 --> 40:17.330
<i>Use your imagination. </i>

40:23.760 --> 40:26.980
<i>Think of where the greatest torture would be... </i>

40:29.960 --> 40:31.620
<i>I'll see you there. </i>

40:33.360 --> 40:35.620
Senior! We tracked his phone! 

40:36.380 --> 40:38.310
Stop the car over there. 

41:48.750 --> 41:50.920
Where did that bastard go? 

41:58.890 --> 42:00.410
Hey! Kang Jong Yoon! 

43:54.050 --> 43:55.220
It's not me. 

43:55.670 --> 44:00.390
Do you think I believe that? 

45:42.880 --> 45:44.200
Director!  

45:44.200 --> 45:47.630
Kang Jong Yoon and Lee Sun Ho were just seen at Jung Sun. 

45:48.110 --> 45:49.000
Jung Sun? 

45:49.000 --> 45:49.640
Yes. 

45:49.640 --> 45:51.960
They lost Kang Jong Yoon. 

45:51.960 --> 45:54.810
But I think Detective Baek is on his tracks. 

45:54.810 --> 45:57.770
Lee Sun Ho was spotted alone without any hostages. 

46:00.350 --> 46:02.190
Why didn't he bring the hostage? 

46:02.190 --> 46:04.910
He's no match for Kang Jong Yoon without them. 

46:08.020 --> 46:10.490
The place where he wants to meet Kang Jong Yoon... 

46:11.940 --> 46:15.070
...is different from where he put the family? 

46:16.220 --> 46:17.410
How far are the rest of the stables? 

46:17.410 --> 46:20.540
The last one is about 8 km away. 

46:23.090 --> 46:26.140
The final step of Lee Sun Ho's revenge is... 

46:26.140 --> 46:28.720
...the torture of Kang Jong Yoon seeing his family dying. 

46:31.900 --> 46:34.020
The family will be killed first. 

46:34.020 --> 46:35.920
We need to find the hostage. 

46:35.920 --> 46:39.420
What? Wait! Then what about Kang Jong Yoon? 

46:42.840 --> 46:45.470
Lee Sun Ho will call him to the most painful place he can be. 

46:46.170 --> 46:49.480
Then, wouldn't that be at the hospital where hong Jung Im died? 

46:53.170 --> 46:54.970
What's more painful? 

46:55.870 --> 46:58.280
The moment Hong Jung Im died? 

46:59.080 --> 47:01.040
Or after she died? 

47:06.710 --> 47:10.270
In her case, the gambling addict treatment didn't work. 

47:10.270 --> 47:12.830
But she decided to come back. 

47:12.830 --> 47:15.570
Probably because of the 2 year old. 

47:17.870 --> 47:21.890
Hong Jung Im was pregnant? 

47:23.340 --> 47:27.590
But the fetus was infected with syphilis. 

47:29.890 --> 47:33.110
Syphilis is a disease that's easily curable but... 

47:33.110 --> 47:35.270
The impact was greater than expected. 

47:38.560 --> 47:41.670
Over there. That's where she jumped off. 

47:43.250 --> 47:46.340
She was pregnant too.
How unfortunate. 

47:58.840 --> 48:01.430
Jung Im! What's wrong with you? 

48:01.430 --> 48:03.700
I'm fine. 

48:03.700 --> 48:05.540
With our baby... 

48:06.880 --> 48:09.320
Let's start over. Okay? 

48:09.320 --> 48:10.540
Jung Im! 

48:11.270 --> 48:13.170
I don't want anything else. 

48:14.620 --> 48:19.790
Please... just stay by my side.
Please... Okay? 

48:25.540 --> 48:27.210
Honey. 

48:29.630 --> 48:31.960
Will you save me from here? 

48:33.970 --> 48:35.340
I... 

48:39.210 --> 48:42.320
...really want to escape from this place. 

49:00.270 --> 49:01.850
Jung Im!  

49:06.370 --> 49:08.230
Jung Im!  

49:10.340 --> 49:12.160
Jung Im!  

49:16.180 --> 49:18.320
Jung Im!  

50:01.410 --> 50:04.140
What did we do to you? 

50:04.980 --> 50:07.100
Please just save my daughter. 

50:10.500 --> 50:12.550
Daddy. 

50:54.200 --> 50:57.480
Do you think I believe that? 

51:22.890 --> 51:24.230
Viper! 

51:24.230 --> 51:27.690
A suspicious man was asking for boats that go to Pohang. 

51:27.690 --> 51:29.070
It seemed urgent! 

51:29.070 --> 51:31.260
That bastard took the bait. 

51:31.260 --> 51:32.600
When did you say you would meet him? 

51:32.600 --> 51:33.530
Tonight. 

51:33.530 --> 51:35.340
Okay. Don't get caught. 

51:36.450 --> 51:38.050
Pohang! Hurry! 

52:24.770 --> 52:28.380
There were only 12 rules. 

52:48.120 --> 52:50.410
I thought we were going our own ways. 

52:50.410 --> 52:52.730
Lee Sun Ho is calling for Kang Jong Yoon. 

52:52.730 --> 52:55.540
<i>Kang Jong Yoon thinks that his daughter and wife are there. </i>

52:55.540 --> 52:57.250
<i>And he's on his way. </i>

52:57.250 --> 52:58.720
Help me. 

52:59.430 --> 53:03.060
We can stop Kang Jong Yoon before he meets with Lee Sun Ho. 

53:04.430 --> 53:07.780
I just got a call from a friend I know. 

53:07.780 --> 53:10.700
<i>Someone will be smuggling out tonight in an emergency. </i>

53:11.870 --> 53:14.240
I think that guy will be Kang Jong Yoon. 

53:15.060 --> 53:17.880
<i>That bastard gave up on finding Lee Sun Ho and... </i>

53:17.880 --> 53:20.560
...is planning on running away with the money. Why? 

53:21.230 --> 53:23.710
He knows he's been caught. 

53:25.640 --> 53:27.110
That could be true. 

53:27.820 --> 53:29.850
<i>But in case it's not... </i>

53:31.460 --> 53:32.580
Kang Jong Yoon... 

53:33.880 --> 53:37.590
...will be tortured by seeing his family die in front of his face. 

53:38.420 --> 53:39.580
<i>Who knows. </i>

53:40.620 --> 53:42.420
Which one is the truth? 

53:43.540 --> 53:47.130
Is Kang Jong Yoon going to save his family? Or... 

53:48.260 --> 53:50.630
Is he running away with the 5 hundred million? 

53:51.200 --> 53:52.280
Let's hang up. 

53:52.280 --> 53:53.450
Senior! 

54:01.230 --> 54:02.940
I'm sorry for what happened a year ago. 

54:07.720 --> 54:10.370
I shouldn't have done that to my team members. 

54:14.870 --> 54:16.840
I'm sorry this is late. 

54:21.450 --> 54:24.650
There's nothing more painful than watching the person you love die. 

54:25.830 --> 54:27.800
<i>That feeling... </i>

54:29.120 --> 54:35.180
Didn't you once tell me that you understood those feelings? 

54:36.690 --> 54:38.030
<i>Help me. </i>

54:40.910 --> 54:42.900
Please prevent this tragedy. 

54:53.710 --> 54:56.580
Senior! We tracked Kang Jong Yoon's phone again! 

55:00.000 --> 55:01.860
He's opposite from Pohang! 

55:01.860 --> 55:04.410
He's heading towards Jung Sun! 

55:11.870 --> 55:13.620
You saw him. 

55:13.620 --> 55:16.390
He knows we're after him so he went the opposite way. 

55:17.120 --> 55:18.090
Keep driving. 

56:15.420 --> 56:17.510
Where do you think they'd be? 

56:17.510 --> 56:19.240
Use your imagination. 

56:27.890 --> 56:31.420
You guys should do something special. 

56:31.420 --> 56:34.230
No no, we can't. 

56:34.230 --> 56:37.900
Just do it for fun. Fun! 

56:37.900 --> 56:42.050
Today is your anniversary.
Let's leave a special memory- 

56:42.050 --> 56:43.760
Honey. 

56:43.760 --> 56:45.040
What? 

56:45.880 --> 56:48.110
That feeling... 

56:59.980 --> 57:04.240
Didn't you once tell me that you understood those feelings? 

57:05.690 --> 57:08.970
I understand your feelings. 

57:10.620 --> 57:12.760
Do you really understand? 

57:14.400 --> 57:16.540
I don't even understand! 

57:37.580 --> 57:38.900
Senior! 

57:51.050 --> 57:53.100
Follow that car to Pohang. 

57:53.100 --> 57:54.360
What about you. 

57:54.360 --> 57:55.230
Quickly. 

58:36.820 --> 58:38.750
Minji! Minji! 

58:38.750 --> 58:41.630
Eun Joo!
Minji! 

58:55.570 --> 58:57.670
It's this house!  

58:58.580 --> 58:59.740
Kang Minji! 

59:04.940 --> 59:06.250
Kang Minji! 

59:17.020 --> 59:19.550
You found this place pretty well. 

59:20.500 --> 59:23.290
Taking the money and running away... 

59:24.780 --> 59:26.600
Was that you bluffing? 

59:26.600 --> 59:29.130
Stop saying useless things. 

59:29.130 --> 59:31.340
Where's Minji and Eun Joo? 

59:43.310 --> 59:45.240
Director! 

59:52.660 --> 59:55.880
What can you do?
I think it's too late. 

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:40.610
Why?! 

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.070
Why?! 

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.500
How is hell? 

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.390
Don't move! 

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:11.750
I can't sleep because of you Mister. 

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:20.810
Kang Jong Yoon. 

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.790
They're alive.

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:38.570
Who are you? 

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.170
This is the police. 

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:42.130
My daughter... 

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.800
The 13th step. 

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.810
You... 

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:14.200
...must watch your daughter... 

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.960
...grow up... 

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.970
[13 steps] 

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:54.260
Lee Sun Ho's last words were
"The 13th step." 

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.680
Do you know anything about that? 

01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.640
I thought that he would only harm us. 

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.010
He asked me a question. 

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:09.510
He asked me why I had made a 13th step. 

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.720
But... 

01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:23.870
Why did you make a 13th step? 

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:34.720
When I finished writing down the 12th step... 

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.260
I realized that my husband would never come back. 

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:43.110
That's why I drew another one. 

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:44.750
Minji's father... 

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.160
Even though he can't escape his gambling addiction... 

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:54.660
I'll still be beside him. 

01:05:56.210 --> 01:05:59.070
That sounds like hell. 

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:05.050
He was my first love. 

01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:07.740
That's why I made him a promise. 

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:12.250
No matter what anyone else says... 

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:13.550
I... 

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.760
...promised him that I'd always be his last love. 

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.800
The bottle was mixed with a sweetener and a sleeping aid. 

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.020
We found the bottle cover in his pocket. 

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.130
He switched the liquid at the last minute. 

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.920
He probably had a change of heart. 

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.090
Why would he do that? 

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:23.420
After seeing Kim Eun Joo and Kang Minji... 

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:28.620
He wanted to give you the last chance that he never got. 

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:32.340
Last chance? 

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.930
To get rid of your gambling addiction. 

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.670
You can only love if you're alive. 

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:06.400
They might consider this as a extenuating circumstance but... 

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.080
You still have to pay for the murder. 

01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:14.120
But compared to the rest of your life,
this really isn't that long. 

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:18.729
How you choose to live after that is up to you. 

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:33.710
Kang Jong Yoon. 

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:40.330
You gave up money to save your family? 

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:41.920
You've changed. 

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.660
No. 

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:51.500
What you thought was correct. 

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:55.330
Even after I left that house... 

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:58.359
I kept thinking about the money. 

01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:04.130
That's why I went back in the morning. 

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.740
If those people weren't dead... 

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:13.300
Who knows what could have happened? 

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.029
You're right that I didn't give up the money. 

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:23.920
Whether I believed I could finally go home if I had that money... 

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.510
Or whether I wanted to keep gambling... 

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:35.720
I don't know either. 

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.910
Daddy... 

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.760
Daddy... You're leaving again? 

01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:11.760
This time... 

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:16.260
I'll be right back. 

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:22.300
Promise. 

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:25.760
Why did you turn the car back? 

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.580
I didn't want to regret. 

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.080
If I misunderstood him and ended this case wrong... 

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:39.750
I felt like I'd regret it every day. 

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.220
I guess you didn't turn back for me. 

01:11:57.450 --> 01:11:58.710
Director Yeo. 

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:02.380
Is he doing well these days? 

01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:11.340
Are they fighting again? 

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.260
Just let them be. 

01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:17.390
They fight and then make up...
That's how it goes. 

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.890
I'm not sure. 

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:41.830
Case closed. 

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.630
Everyone get ready to leave. 

01:12:56.890 --> 01:12:58.750
Are you not coming? 

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.170
This Lee Sun Ho person... 

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:17.800
Why did he stop his revenge? 

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.270
I'm not sure. 

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:28.380
Maybe he got tired of it.

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:51.520
<i>He cheated on his wife. </i>

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.090
<i>You have resent towards him? </i>
