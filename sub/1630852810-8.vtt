Oh, yeah, we all saw it, Elfo.

And we'll never unsee it.

10:29.337 --> 10:33.215
Oh, sweet butter, you're the only thing
right with the world.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.802
Oh, Bean, you're right. It's uncanny.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.430
Hmm, how many
of those snack treats you got?

10:39.513 --> 10:41.265
What do you think
that sack is filled with?

10:41.349 --> 10:43.976
Pack your cheeseballs.
We're going to Bentwood.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.604
[adventurous music playing]

11:02.536 --> 11:05.206
I'm sorry,
but we're not taking refugees today.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.374
Or any day.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.625
Of course, no. Yeah.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.462
Uh, I'm actually Princess Tiabeanie
from the mighty kingdom of Dreamland,

11:11.545 --> 11:15.424
and we're on a diplomatic mission
of great secrecy and importance.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.134
Not in that thing, you ain't.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.558
For God's sake, enough chitter chatter.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.979
Let us in right now or I'll have you
transferred to an early grave.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.190
Prince Merkimer! Forgive me.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.485
I'll order your usual fanfare immediately.
[claps twice]

11:35.152 --> 11:37.321
[playing smooth jazz tune]

11:42.952 --> 11:43.953
Bow lower.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.913
Even lower.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.581
-[all grunt]
-[snickers]

11:48.082 --> 11:50.459
[regal harpsichord music playing]

11:58.634 --> 12:01.512
[Bean] Huh. Actually not as grand
as I thought it'd be.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.972
[Merkimer] That's the garage.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.690
[playing regal tune]

12:15.317 --> 12:16.861
[Merkimer] Mother! Father!

12:16.944 --> 12:17.820
The rest of you.

12:17.903 --> 12:22.324
I, Prince Merkimer of Bentwood,
welcome you all to my return.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.869
Is that Merkimer? [groans]

12:24.952 --> 12:26.454
You hug him this time.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.673
[soldiers grunt]

12:38.257 --> 12:39.717
Oh, happy day.

12:39.800 --> 12:44.180
Uh… Merkimer, my favorite son
since my favorite son died.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.389
You've returned.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.601
But this is impossible.
You were transposed into a pig.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.977
I saw it. How did you--

12:50.060 --> 12:53.063
Sorcerio, our fabulous wizard,

12:53.147 --> 12:57.401
he switched your pig-son Merkimer
back into his human-body Merkimer.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.319
[all gasp]

12:58.944 --> 13:02.156
I return your son to you,
asking nothing in return.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.742
Except for… [clears throat]

13:04.825 --> 13:06.785
one little favor?

13:06.869 --> 13:07.703
Oh, here we go.

13:07.786 --> 13:11.081
Dreamland needs
a large amount of money, right away,

13:11.165 --> 13:13.709
and maybe some cannons,
arrows, plus shields and swords.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.628
And what're those
ball-chain-y things called?

13:15.711 --> 13:18.380
You dare ask for ball-chain-y things

13:18.464 --> 13:20.966
after killing one son
and pig-ifying the other?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.343
I hear you, I do.

13:22.426 --> 13:26.472
I'm listening hard,
but I need you to listen back.

13:26.555 --> 13:30.893
Prince Merkimer might have something
to say that'll change your minds.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.019
You're on, baby.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.354
-Flick.
-[gulps]

13:36.440 --> 13:39.360
Friends, enemies, friends with benefits,

13:39.443 --> 13:43.239
lackeys, lickspittles,
flunkies, flatterers, ass-kissers

13:43.322 --> 13:45.824
and all of fair Bentwood, listen up.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.994
Today, you receive a gift from heaven.

13:49.078 --> 13:49.912
Me.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.038
[crowd cheers]

13:52.039 --> 13:52.873
[Elfo] Flick.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.544
And for this gift, we owe
a tremendous debt of gratitude

13:56.627 --> 13:58.045
to none other than…

13:58.754 --> 14:00.381
-me.
-[whispering] What?

14:00.464 --> 14:04.343
Now, let the celebration
of all things Merkimer begin.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.054
Free beer at the pub,
for as long as my allowance lasts.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.722
That's not why we came here.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.850
-[crowd cheers]
-[upbeat harpsichord music playing]

14:15.980 --> 14:17.022
Great speech.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.234
Now, maybe can we talk about the money
and weapons we came here for?

14:20.317 --> 14:23.028
In due time, Bean. In due time.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.780
[indistinct chatter]

14:25.364 --> 14:26.407
[Merkimer chuckles]

14:27.283 --> 14:28.492
[Bean sighs in exasperation]

14:32.121 --> 14:34.248
A toast to Prince Merkimer.

14:34.331 --> 14:39.211
A gallant guzzler who never met a table
he couldn't drink someone under.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.589
[all chanting] Slurp, slurp, slurp.

14:42.089 --> 14:42.965
Huzzah!

14:43.048 --> 14:44.216
Good show.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.427
Just like old times, eh, Merk?

14:46.510 --> 14:47.803
-Quite so.
-[burps]

14:47.887 --> 14:49.179
[all laughing]

14:51.849 --> 14:52.683
[oinks]

14:54.143 --> 14:54.977
[all chuckle]

14:55.728 --> 14:58.939
I thought we were done with this charade
when he went off and became a pig.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.816
Which was a step up, by the way.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.109
[all laughing]

15:03.068 --> 15:03.903
[sighs]

15:11.994 --> 15:13.120
[groaning]

15:14.997 --> 15:17.833
[Bean] Ugh, God, where's his bed?
It's dark in here.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.084
It's right in front of you.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.878
-[grunts]
-[thud]

15:20.961 --> 15:23.297
-Close enough. What a jerk.
-Big jerk.

15:23.380 --> 15:27.968
Of all the jerks in this jerk kingdom,
I think the worst is Merkimer.

15:28.052 --> 15:28.886
Sigh.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.596
I forgive you.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.349
I know you didn't mean
for me to overhear that.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.433
I did mean that.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.606
[Bunny] Oh, brother-husband.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.900
There's that pig
our son seems so attached to!

15:42.983 --> 15:44.777
Ugh, hideous creature.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.737
What do you mean? The pig or our son?

15:46.820 --> 15:48.072
[both laugh]

15:52.284 --> 15:53.744
Woe is me.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.165
I'm so very, very, very, very, very…

15:58.248 --> 15:59.625
[continues repeating]

16:07.758 --> 16:08.801
sad.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.935
Leave me be.
I'm crestfallen and I can't get up.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.561
All right, knock off the self-pity.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.648
We're wasting time, and drinks
are really expensive in this place.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.234
We need to close the deal
with your parents now.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.527
Where's Big Boy Merkimer?

16:26.610 --> 16:27.945
[scoffs] I don't know.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.948
Last time I saw him, he was in the corner
trying to mount his own shadow.

16:31.031 --> 16:34.201
He abandoned me,
like everyone eventually does.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.911
-I'm so alone.
-[door closes]

16:37.037 --> 16:37.913
Sigh.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.045
[Bean] Why did I think Merkimer
would ever come through for us?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.213
God, I feel so naive.

16:46.296 --> 16:49.299
[Luci] I would have also accepted
stupid, foolish or schmucky.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.928
You don't need that little pink squealer.
You can ask his parents yourself.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.682
Hey, yeah! I'll just put on
the ol' pathetic, single princess act.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.599
[chuckles]

16:57.683 --> 16:59.226
Yeah, "put on."

17:02.646 --> 17:04.064
Mad.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.650
[Bean] Look, there's Merkimer.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.652
But where are King Lorenzo
and Queen Bunny?

17:08.736 --> 17:10.904
[Merkimer] Mumsy and Daddy?
I had enough of them.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.823
Merkimer, shut up. You're not helping.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.116
I'm not trying to help.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.993
Also, I didn't say anything.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.036
Then who did?

17:17.119 --> 17:18.328
It was I.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.289
-[all exclaim]
-What?

17:20.372 --> 17:21.290
You can talk?

17:21.373 --> 17:24.168
I can even soliloquize,
Princess Tiabeanie.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.879
Once, I lived a wild
and carefree bachelor life

17:26.962 --> 17:29.423
of rampaging naked across the countryside.

17:29.506 --> 17:31.216
But you took that away from me.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.219
From the moment you hosed me off,
I have been watching you.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.556
Slowly, I learned to speak,
but I held my tongue,

17:37.639 --> 17:42.978
biding my time until the moment I could
deploy the art you've best schooled me in.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.563
-Backstabbing.
-[all gasp]

17:46.273 --> 17:48.525
Welcome to my one-man revolution.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.818
This is a coup.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.863
I've imprisoned everyone
who laughed at me, belittled me,

17:52.946 --> 17:55.115
or beat me at badminton.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.658
Guards who live in this tube,

17:56.742 --> 18:01.455
come to the throne room immediately
and arrest the princess and her boy-toys.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.624
Oh, I like that. Hey!

18:04.124 --> 18:05.584
Merkimer, do something.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.960
I intend to.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.089
[grunts]

18:11.256 --> 18:12.216
Take her away.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.802
What? I thought
that we were buds, you know?

18:14.885 --> 18:17.387
We had, like, a banter! We bonded!

18:17.471 --> 18:20.933
And we're both screwed-up royal kids,
searching for ourselves.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.520
It would take a lot of love-making with me
to change my mind.

18:24.603 --> 18:25.687
Take me away.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.315
I'm gonna tell your mumsy
and daddy about this.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.693
Please do.
They're awaiting you in the dungeon.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.281
You know, Merkimer?
I have dreamed of this day all my life.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.492
Seeing myself sitting there on the throne.

18:38.575 --> 18:39.868
Ruler over all.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.578
Vanquisher of my enemies.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.789
A big, fat smirk on my face.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.374
But it's been a lonely dream.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.001
Amazingly, I've had
the same dream myself, Merkimer.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.503
-Really?
-Really.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.880
Here, I have something for you.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.383
And I, you.

18:59.888 --> 19:00.722
Merkimer.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.141
Oh, Merkimer.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.768
[both laughing]

19:12.151 --> 19:13.819
[both continue laughing]

19:24.621 --> 19:26.331
We wouldn't be in this dungeon

19:26.415 --> 19:29.710
if you'd married our spoiled,
ungrateful son in the first place.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.212
Oh, I'm so sorry I didn't marry a pig

19:32.296 --> 19:34.381
just so you could have
more poor people to tax.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.926
Don't play coy with me.
You know what that alliance was about.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.095
Yeah, finally settling my bar tab.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.223
Young lady, it had nothing to do
with our fabulous wealth,

19:43.307 --> 19:46.852
and everything to do
with Dreamland's secret resources.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.228
And I will get them.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.772
Lorenzo always gets what he wants.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.109
Guards, let us out this instant.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.195
No way, you greedy bastard.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.529
[sighs]

20:01.200 --> 20:02.451
[both laughing]

20:03.076 --> 20:04.536
I just heard about the coup.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.996
As the palace wizard,

20:06.079 --> 20:09.374
I offer you my humble
but fabulous magical services,

20:09.458 --> 20:11.335
Your revolutionary Highnesses.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.962
Please, call us what we call ourselves.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.672
[both] The Merkimer boys.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.174
Oh, God.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.429
[snorts]

20:26.141 --> 20:28.185
[gasps] Mom?

20:28.268 --> 20:31.563
My poor Bean. Tricked by a pig.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.399
Don't you know
you can't trust anyone but yourself?

20:34.483 --> 20:37.027
Your friends will all
leave you in the end.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.820
Every last one.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.241
And then you'll be all alone,
with only me behind you.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.158
[gasps]

20:45.077 --> 20:47.079
Luci, you wouldn't leave me, would you?

20:47.162 --> 20:50.415
No. Till death do us part, Beanie baby.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.045
Merkimer, I've come to a decision.
I want to be a pig again.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.589
You do? You surprise me, me.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.676
Yes. I see the way
you eat and sleep and bathe…

21:00.759 --> 21:01.677
Well, not bathe.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.136
And I long for those days.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.473
I want to switch bodies
with you again. What say you?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.558
Well, it's only my most fondest wish.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.810
But this is impossible.

21:09.893 --> 21:13.480
It would take a wizard of great competence
to produce such a spell.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.732
You mean anyone but Sorcerio.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.943
The potion is ready.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.987
I drew blood from the visiting elf.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.571
My, what a squirmer.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.156
We can dispose of him now.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.784
Poor, sweet Elmo.
He's always been there for us.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.911
That's why I remembered his name.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.337
[guard] Your Majesty,
the torture chamber is ready.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.506
Torture chamber? Isn't that cruel?

21:39.589 --> 21:42.592
Your friend Bean wanted money.
Now, she'll drown in it.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.636
[guard] Man, what a jerk.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.179
Oh, is this thing on?

21:47.222 --> 21:49.433
Well, at least they gave us our own room.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.313
Look, that ceiling panel's opening up.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.939
-That ain't good.
-Ow!

21:56.523 --> 21:57.899
A coin? Ow!

21:58.400 --> 22:00.027
Another coin. Ow!

22:00.736 --> 22:02.863
Ow! Ow!

22:02.946 --> 22:07.326
-Hmm, I'm sensing a pattern here.
-Ow! Ow!

22:07.409 --> 22:12.205
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

22:12.289 --> 22:13.999
-Elfo.
-What? Ow!

22:14.082 --> 22:16.418
-Scoot away.
-No, I was here first. Ow!

22:16.501 --> 22:18.920
-I'm not jealous of getting hit.
-Ow!

22:19.004 --> 22:21.048
-Just scoot your--
-You clearly are. Ow!

22:21.131 --> 22:24.176
Ow! Ow! Ow!

22:24.259 --> 22:25.969
[chuckles softly] Jealous? Ow!

22:26.053 --> 22:27.095
I'm not at all.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.555
You clearly are. [shakily] Ow!

22:28.638 --> 22:29.890
I'm not. You're crying.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.433
No, I'm not. I love it!

22:31.516 --> 22:33.852
[crying] It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.771
Elfo, scoot away.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.731
[crying] Help me! Ow.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.484
Let us toast. To us.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.736
Hold on a moment. What's that sound?

22:42.819 --> 22:43.779
What sound?

22:43.862 --> 22:46.656
Ow! Ow! Ow!

22:46.740 --> 22:48.283
[Elfo] You know what really pisses me off?

22:48.366 --> 22:49.409
That we're gonna die?

22:49.493 --> 22:51.453
[Elfo] No. Yes. Ow!

22:51.536 --> 22:54.289
That it's all because
we trusted that stupid pig. Ow!

22:54.372 --> 22:56.041
And I thought he was our friend. Ow!

22:56.124 --> 22:57.334
-Oh, Elfo.
-[Elfo] Ow!

22:57.417 --> 22:59.377
We can't know
what's going on in Merkimer's heart.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.295
[Elfo] Ow!

23:00.378 --> 23:02.464
But I refuse to believe
he would do this to us.

23:02.547 --> 23:03.381
[Elfo] Ow!

23:03.465 --> 23:05.842
-[Bean] That stupid pig is our friend.
-[Elfo] Ow!

23:05.926 --> 23:06.760
What?

23:06.843 --> 23:08.512
Here, I'll turn down the volume.

23:09.387 --> 23:12.474
Now, where were we? Oh, yes, right here.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.477
To me. To you. To us.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.229
"Us"?

23:18.647 --> 23:19.481
Us?

23:20.482 --> 23:21.775
[Bean grunting]

23:21.858 --> 23:23.193
[dramatic music playing]

23:25.570 --> 23:27.823
[Luci] Elfo, whatever you do,
keep your mouth shut.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.033
You're not the boss of me-- [groans]

23:30.117 --> 23:31.451
[Luci] Told ya. [chuckles]

23:31.535 --> 23:32.661
[groaning]

23:34.162 --> 23:36.623
[Elfo] Help! I swallowed $50!

23:36.706 --> 23:38.208
[Luci] Help me, not Elfo!

23:38.291 --> 23:42.087
[groans] My wee hooves
are good for nothing. I'm useless.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.047
Just a fat, greasy pig.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.091
Why, that's it!

23:51.847 --> 23:52.889
[squeals]

23:55.433 --> 23:56.685
[muffled groaning]

23:57.310 --> 23:59.437
[gasping, breathing heavily]

23:59.521 --> 24:01.022
[grunting]

24:02.149 --> 24:03.316
Am I the hero?

24:03.400 --> 24:06.820
Oh, Merkimer. I'm so disappointed in you.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.029
And I, you.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.117
[grunts]

24:12.200 --> 24:14.661
What the hell, Merkimer?
Now you're kicking pigs?

24:14.744 --> 24:16.872
It's okay, Bean! I've learned how to roll.

24:17.455 --> 24:18.665
-[screams]
-[thud]

24:18.748 --> 24:20.584
-[gasps]
-[cackling]

24:22.169 --> 24:23.211
Oh, no.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.838
[dramatic music playing]

24:25.797 --> 24:26.840
Oh!

24:28.466 --> 24:30.552
-[exclaiming]
-[wizard exclaims]

24:39.186 --> 24:40.270
Hello, Bean.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.230
Shut up, you arrogant bastard.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.107
Touché, mon amour.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.694
With your brains and my beauty,
what a twosome we could've been.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.779
Maybe you weren't a monster
when I found you,

24:49.863 --> 24:51.489
but I definitely turned you into one.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.200
And now, I have to kill you.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.077
But I am the one spinning the flail.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.537
That's what it's called.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.291
Bean, look out!

25:02.584 --> 25:05.170
[Bean] Whoa! [screams]

25:07.839 --> 25:10.258
[Elfo stammering] Bean, your boot!

25:10.342 --> 25:11.468
[Bean] Not again.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.178
Whee!

25:13.261 --> 25:14.721
-[thud]
-[human Merkimer] Quite sad.

25:14.804 --> 25:15.889
That's disgusting.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.099
Guys. Guys! Pull me up.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.227
[sighs]

25:20.685 --> 25:21.645
[grunting]

25:24.314 --> 25:26.733
[Bean] Faster, Turbish! Drive. Drive!

25:26.816 --> 25:29.819
Goodbye, Bentwood. Goodbye forever.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.571
Sorry I ruined everything.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.698
No, you saved us, Merkimer.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.242
You're a better person as a pig

25:35.325 --> 25:37.786
than any of those pigs
back there are as people.

25:37.869 --> 25:38.995
Never forget that.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.288
I suppose you're right.

25:40.372 --> 25:44.125
You may not have gotten any money,
you may not have gotten any weapons.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.337
But you escaped
with the greatest treasure of all.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.255
Me.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.840
Really coulda used that money, though.

25:51.633 --> 25:52.467
[gagging]

25:55.095 --> 25:57.597
-Now, all we need is weapons.
-[coughs]

25:57.681 --> 25:59.808
We've got arrows!

25:59.891 --> 26:00.976
[all cheering]

26:03.311 --> 26:05.730
[closing theme music playing]
