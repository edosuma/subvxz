49:38.851 --> 49:40.759
A young man was killed.
That trucker,

49:40.853 --> 49:42.061
he's been stalking,
he has my daughter's--

49:42.146 --> 49:45.022
I'm sorry ma'am, we're getting
calls of a multi-car pile-up

49:45.108 --> 49:47.433
on highway 10, we're just spread
too thin right now.

49:47.527 --> 49:50.444
Now I'm gonna assume you have
a license for the gun.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.655
There's a diner
not too far from here.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.573
They keep a few rooms out back.

49:54.659 --> 49:56.575
I'll let them know
you're coming.

49:56.661 --> 49:59.954
- You can't just leave us here.
- You'll be safe at Earl's.

50:00.081 --> 50:01.956
Stay visible, stay in public.

50:02.083 --> 50:04.709
You call us if this trucker
shows up.

50:06.421 --> 50:07.169
I can't believe this.

50:07.255 --> 50:10.381
Mom, we need to talk
about Carly.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.969
Hey, guys.
Have you seen my phone?

50:15.096 --> 50:20.558
I thought it was in the car,
but has anybody seen it?

50:20.643 --> 50:24.145
Yeah, here.
It was in the back.

50:26.566 --> 50:29.859
Well, you heard what he said.
Let's go find this diner.

50:29.944 --> 50:39.994
♪

51:01.142 --> 51:06.512
(country music plays)

51:06.606 --> 51:09.231
Well, look what the polar bear
dragged in.

51:09.317 --> 51:10.349
Get yourselves inside,

51:10.443 --> 51:14.520
it's colder than a gravedigger's
shovel out there.

51:14.614 --> 51:16.238
(chuckling)
Follow me.

51:17.825 --> 51:19.408
Have a seat right there.

51:24.457 --> 51:26.290
Menu's just a formality tonight.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.367
Sent the staff home
due to the cold snap.

51:28.461 --> 51:29.535
I'm not whipping up
anything new,

51:29.629 --> 51:31.587
but I've got a pot of
Mulligan stew on the stove,

51:31.672 --> 51:33.923
and I'm offering free seconds.

51:34.008 --> 51:35.966
Sounds good,
we'll take three bowls.

51:36.052 --> 51:37.593
Earl:
Coming right up.

51:47.146 --> 51:49.438
Carly?

51:50.650 --> 51:52.057
It's time that you told us
the truth

51:52.151 --> 51:55.277
about what's going on here.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.154
About Boyd.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.531
No more lies.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.065
Laura:
She's nothing but a thief.

52:00.159 --> 52:02.952
Why would you expect her to tell
the truth now?

52:03.037 --> 52:04.736
Was that the whole plan, Carly?

52:04.831 --> 52:07.498
Rob us in our sleep,
take everything we had?

52:08.543 --> 52:10.126
Something like that.

52:10.211 --> 52:13.587
From the moment I picked you up,
it was all some con,

52:13.714 --> 52:16.132
I was nothing but a mark
to you.

52:16.217 --> 52:17.424
I was trying to help you.

52:17.552 --> 52:18.917
What the hell is the matter
with you?

52:19.011 --> 52:20.928
I didn't ask for your help,
okay?!

52:21.055 --> 52:23.556
You're not my mom, you're not my
sister, you're not my friend,

52:23.641 --> 52:25.224
you're just some stranger
in a car.

52:25.309 --> 52:26.392
You were standing alone
by the side of the highway

52:26.477 --> 52:28.269
with your thumb out.
How is that not asking for help?

52:28.396 --> 52:31.856
I wasn't looking for help.
I was looking for a sucker!

52:31.941 --> 52:33.774
Don't you get that?
You're just a sucker!

52:33.901 --> 52:36.610
Carly, stay.
Just talk to us.

52:36.737 --> 52:38.654
We can still figure this out.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.772
Yeah, sure, whatever.

52:40.867 --> 52:42.950
It's forgiveness day
at Earl's Diner.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.451
Helen: Carly.

52:45.413 --> 52:47.413
We are not your enemy.

52:55.047 --> 52:56.422
(sighing)

52:57.800 --> 53:00.292
Right now, we need to work
together.

53:00.386 --> 53:02.803
You need to tell us
what's going on.

53:02.930 --> 53:04.129
This trucker, he's after you.
Why?

53:04.223 --> 53:06.131
What happened between you?

53:06.225 --> 53:10.802
I guess he thinks me and Boyd
ruined his crappy life.

53:10.897 --> 53:11.970
Why would he think that?

53:12.064 --> 53:14.481
Because he's crazy, that's why!

53:14.609 --> 53:17.610
Three bowls of Mulligan stew.
There you go.

53:22.408 --> 53:24.909
And a basket of butter rolls
on the house.

53:24.994 --> 53:26.452
Enjoy.

53:33.461 --> 53:35.711
You know, Carly,

53:35.796 --> 53:39.632
once upon a time, I wasn't all
that different from you.

53:39.717 --> 53:41.500
Sure you weren't.

53:41.594 --> 53:43.385
I had a boyfriend,

53:43.471 --> 53:45.179
he was a lot like Boyd.

53:47.141 --> 53:48.173
His name was Daryl.

53:48.267 --> 53:54.063
I loved him more than cigarettes
and apple pie.

53:54.148 --> 53:57.233
I even married him for a while.

53:57.318 --> 54:01.195
I loved that boy so much,
he could talk me into anything.

54:02.490 --> 54:05.616
Before he was a trucker,
he liked to steal cars.

54:05.701 --> 54:08.702
So we stole cars.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.538
You were a badass, Helen?

54:11.666 --> 54:15.534
No, never quite.

54:15.628 --> 54:20.130
I liked making our plans,
figuring our angles.

54:20.216 --> 54:22.541
Being partners.

54:22.635 --> 54:24.426
But then I saw some of
the things he had to do

54:24.512 --> 54:26.595
when plans went wrong.

54:26.681 --> 54:28.973
And the thing about plans
like that, they go wrong a lot.

54:29.058 --> 54:31.100
So...

54:31.185 --> 54:32.309
I stopped.

54:34.438 --> 54:37.564
When Daryl got caught,
I stood by him for a while.

54:37.692 --> 54:40.693
Paid his lawyer's fees,
his appeals.

54:41.320 --> 54:45.614
And then I found out...

54:45.700 --> 54:49.576
That love, for him,
was just another long con.

54:49.704 --> 54:53.080
I've been putting my life back
together for a long time now.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.500
Some of the pieces even
seem to fit.

55:01.507 --> 55:02.923
(sighing)

55:04.719 --> 55:06.385
How did you do that?

55:08.222 --> 55:09.346
Put your life back together?

55:09.432 --> 55:13.809
Well, I had to admit that
I could make some bad choices.

55:15.104 --> 55:17.229
That my instincts are not
some golden guide.

55:17.315 --> 55:21.099
Sometimes they're flat-out
wrong.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.277
It was only after I took
ownership of those bad choices

55:23.404 --> 55:26.238
that I could start to make some
good ones again.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.782
Look.

55:30.119 --> 55:33.037
I don't blame you if you
ditch me.

55:33.122 --> 55:36.040
I would have done the
same thing.

55:36.125 --> 55:38.500
Worse.

55:38.586 --> 55:40.085
If you go...

55:41.714 --> 55:44.340
Maybe he'll settle for just me.

55:44.425 --> 55:47.176
Laura: We're not gonna
ditch you, Carly.

55:47.261 --> 55:50.929
It's just a hell of a thing
you put us in.

55:51.015 --> 55:54.641
We're gonna work this out
together.

55:54.769 --> 55:56.310

gonna burst into tears

I just, I...

We can't call anyone.

- What now, Mom?
- We rush him.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.538
All three of us.

57:06.632 --> 57:09.216
Helen shoots him in the back,
I'll stab him in the neck.

do that, right?

What if we confront him and
something goes wrong?

57:14.348 --> 57:17.266
Someone innocent gets hurt?
Like them, or him.

57:17.351 --> 57:20.552
- They didn't ask for this.
- It's self-defense.

57:20.646 --> 57:21.520
Not yet, it isn't.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.772
Fine, then call it capital
punishment.

and jury here.

57:28.195 --> 57:30.988

Just surrender?

We wait.

57:33.701 --> 57:35.534
There's nothing he can do here.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.161
Not with all these people
around.

57:37.246 --> 57:39.246
Are you sure?

57:39.373 --> 57:40.405
What if we find some zip ties?

57:40.499 --> 57:43.241
Tie him up, wait for the cops.

57:43.335 --> 57:45.577
It won't work.
There's a hack for that.

and you snap your forearms
into your hip bones,

57:49.216 --> 57:50.048
it'll snap right off.

57:50.134 --> 57:51.917
Then we'll use rope.
Or bungee cords,

57:52.011 --> 57:53.251
or tied-together napkins.
Whatever.

57:53.345 --> 57:54.761
We are not tying anyone up.

1:21:00.356 --> 1:21:02.565

lost his damn keys?
