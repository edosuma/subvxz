aboard space freighter</i> Mousetromo...

01:24.793 --> 01:28.296
<i>...en route to planet Cheeseball
through the Cat Nebula...</i>

01:28.296 --> 01:31.674

01:31.674 --> 01:36.012
<i>Mission critical,
due to loss of ship's food supply.</i>

01:37.514 --> 01:41.726
I am so sorry, Captain Jerry,
I just wanted a snack.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.429
Say, can I have some
of those emergency food capsules?

02:18.429 --> 02:19.889
I'm starving.

02:37.323 --> 02:41.995
Gee, captain, you just ate a whole year's
worth of dehydrated food.

02:41.995 --> 02:46.791
And when you swallowed it,
it got all wet and really big.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.798
You okay, captain?

03:26.789 --> 03:30.710
Whoa, hold on, Captain Jerry.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.839
Quick, quick. Doctor to the Bridge.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.976
Hang on, Captain Jerry.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.237
I just called the doctor.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.076
Yes, I'm the doctor.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.498
You need to watch your carbs, mister.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.750
I'll toss you a salad.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.253
Alien.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.108
Take that, you alien pussycat.

05:29.037 --> 05:29.996
Ha!

06:42.443 --> 06:45.029
Oh, my. That was cruel, wasn't it?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.513
Hmm. This Earth chicken
seems kind of wimpy.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.890
That's okay.

10:40.890 --> 10:44.894
As long as he lays the 2000 eggs
we need for the queen's cake.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.563
That's right. It's her birthday.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.566
Now, count the eggs.

10:50.566 --> 10:51.942
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.571
One, two, three, four, five.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.448
There's five.

10:57.448 --> 11:01.118
Only 1995 more to go.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.953
Now, collect the eggs pronto...

11:02.953 --> 11:06.248
...so we don't get in trouble
like we did with the cream puffs.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.919
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, cream puffs.
That was bad.

11:14.006 --> 11:18.427
Uh, okay, chicken. Lay 1995 eggs.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.443
Oh, come on, chicken.
You got eggs, don't you?

11:41.534 --> 11:44.203
You know, I think there's something
wrong with the chicken.

11:45.454 --> 11:49.875
Hmm. Sounds defective.
Let's put it in the extractor.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.891
Oh, uh, get this crazy chicken off of me.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.490
Now, go get that chicken.

12:21.490 --> 12:25.828
Hey, he ran
under there. No, not there, there.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.497
No, no, no, over there.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.333
Like, what is going on?

12:32.501 --> 12:37.506
Oh, princess.... We're experiencing
a culinary malfunction.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.176
Yeah, yeah, yeah, culinary malfunction. Yeah.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.845
Oh, yes. I have two words for you.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.346
Oh, yeah? What's that?

12:44.346 --> 12:46.515
Cream puffs.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.437
You heard her. Get back to work.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.689
Time's a-wasting.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
Happy birthday, Your Majesty.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.598
Yeah, yeah, happy birthday.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.102
Oh, my. What a lovely cake.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.771
Now, make a wish, Your Highness.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.031
Uh, Your Highness, that's the chicken.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.450
I don't care what it is.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.620
Just take it back
and bring me a real chicken.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.289
Or else...

14:42.881 --> 14:46.051
Now, get us a good chicken this time.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.762
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.
One chicken coming up.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.664
Hey, how's about a ride?

16:07.591 --> 16:11.929
Hey, don't be a sourpuss.
It's okay to be second.

thanks for saving me a parking spot.

Maybe you can help me
carry my billion and a half clams.
