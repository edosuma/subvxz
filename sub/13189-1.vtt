Good morning.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.759
Watch your back.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.762
All right. I see it.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.503
Ma'am.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.512
This for the living room?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.514
Yeah.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.855
This is one of the nicest houses

03:08.856 --> 03:11.224
we've ever moved
anyone like you into.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.626
It's got gas heat,
air conditioned,

03:13.627 --> 03:16.128
harvest gold fixtures
in the kitchen.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.366
If you like that kind of thing.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.768
Hey, Linda, what do you think?

03:21.769 --> 03:24.304
I always promised
you a nice house.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.473
Let's not get
carried away, Vinnie.

03:26.474 --> 03:27.807
It's going to be a lot easier

03:27.808 --> 03:30.209
if you two start
calling each other

03:30.210 --> 03:31.478
Terry and tod.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.580
It's a nice
house, Terry. Okay?

03:33.581 --> 03:35.682
You're Terry.
He's tod.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.883
Wait for me.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.651
Let's take a look inside.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.653
Come on.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.491
I'll need your
social security number

03:44.492 --> 03:46.693
so I can process your payment.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.495
My what?

03:47.496 --> 03:48.895
Your social security number

03:48.896 --> 03:50.631
so we can pay you.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.235

03:56.236 --> 03:58.037

03:58.038 --> 03:59.506

04:18.791 --> 04:19.593
2...

04:19.594 --> 04:21.862
That's one too many numbers.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.798
Take off the 5.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.702
If you have any problems,

04:29.703 --> 04:32.138
call my office in San Diego.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.140
They always know where I am.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.408
We'll let you know

04:35.409 --> 04:37.410
when we're going
to New York to testify.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.646
Great. Great.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.247
Thanks for everything.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.549
You'll like it here.

04:42.550 --> 04:45.752
I'd live here if
my wife didn't...

04:45.753 --> 04:47.153
Hate it. Right?

04:47.154 --> 04:48.555
No, no, no.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.123
Take my word.
She'd hate it.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.159
She has to be near town

04:53.160 --> 04:55.127
because she works with athletes.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.896
If you ever want
baseball tickets,

04:56.897 --> 04:58.230
give me a call.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.566
Great. Baseball.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.168
The padres play the mets
every so often.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.571
Though you might be yankee fans.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.606
Most organized crime people are.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.207
I love the Yankees.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.809
Linda loves the Yankees.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.177
So does Terry.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.178
Who's Terry?

05:12.179 --> 05:13.346
You are.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.348
If you have questions,
give me a call.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.386
Thanks. I really
appreciate it.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.355
This is my job.
I get paid.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.791
You don't tip FBI men.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.394
Sure, you do.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.763
Yo, Frankie.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.366
You think this
guy's for... hey!

05:33.367 --> 05:36.570
There's a 4:00 nonstop
out of here.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.074
You really going
back to New York?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.075
You'll find another wife.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.176
I know.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.345
I could've pulled
out months ago.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.747
You wouldn't have
gotten the house

05:47.748 --> 05:49.215
or the extra allowance.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.617
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.218
Next time I see you,

05:52.219 --> 05:54.621
you'll be eating white bread.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.356
It's not bad with egg salad.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.025
It's better than the slammer.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.227
Keep telling yourself
that, sweetheart.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.896
You might believe it
after a while.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.634
Stay out of my purse
while I'm on the phone.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.436
I wasn't in your purse.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.437
Yes, you were!

06:10.438 --> 06:11.871
You're always accusing me.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.409
Put the visa card back
in my purse, Vinnie.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.247
I'd like a cab at...

06:21.248 --> 06:23.483
What the frig is
the address here?

06:23.484 --> 06:26.820
How should I know?
Number 1 happy street.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.665
You know what
the guy tried to do?

06:38.666 --> 06:41.333
No idea. I haven't met
a criminal in years.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.136
He tried to tip me.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.371
How much?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.139
$100.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.140
$100?

06:48.141 --> 06:49.542
That's not the point.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.943
He proffered a gratuity.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.147
It's against protocol.
I can't accept that.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.784
Task completed, coopersmith?

06:57.785 --> 06:58.818
Yes, sir.

06:58.819 --> 07:03.089
This isn't going to take
a lot of my time.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.526
Is there anything else
I could take on, sir?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.827
Coopersmith,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.328
this is an important
government witness.

07:09.329 --> 07:11.964
When you've delivered him
to his court appearances,

07:11.965 --> 07:15.134
then we'll talk
about something else.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.469
Not before.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.071
Very good, sir.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.443
Back to the dangerous
world of fha fraud.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.047
I don't want to fill
out any more forms.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.782
I want to go undercover.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.319
I want to stake out
some son of a bitch

07:33.320 --> 07:35.722
and eat a lot of takeout food.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.724
I want to wear a windbreaker.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.726
Once, when I was undercover,

07:39.727 --> 07:41.961
I got to drive a BMW.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.930
I know.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.331
I can't help it.

07:45.332 --> 07:48.536
It was the high point
of my life.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.005
I'm getting back
into undercover work.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.608
Forget it, Kirby.
It's against regulations.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.743
There's overtime.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.612
You can't catch
criminals in the FBI

07:59.613 --> 08:00.913
if there's overtime involved.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.515
Something could change.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.516
Things change.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.752
Yeah. Right.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.889
This is San Diego
all sports radio.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.658
We're talking about
last night's game.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.893
Another loss by the home team.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.162
The pads lost in the ninth

08:16.163 --> 08:19.165
when Wally bunting walked
in the winning run.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.969
What are we going
to do about Wally?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.116
Barney.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.552
Wally. Too bad.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.587
Could've happened
to anybody, right?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.990
Yeah. I guess so.

08:43.991 --> 08:44.792
Relief pitching.

08:44.793 --> 08:46.559
It's a high risk occupation.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.895
Anybody could blow
a 7-run lead.

08:48.896 --> 08:49.896
8.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.530
Whatever.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.700
They're sending me down.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.901
To the minors?

08:54.902 --> 08:55.703
Wichita.

08:55.704 --> 08:57.303
I'm sorry, Wally.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.705
I'm going to miss you.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.807
Margaret will miss you, too.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.810
I mean, therapists
aren't supposed to say

09:03.811 --> 09:05.878
that they'll miss
their patients.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.480
This is the second
relief pitcher

09:08.481 --> 09:11.250
she's lost to
the minors this season.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.920
I'm going, too, Barney.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.122
Where?

09:16.123 --> 09:17.456
To Wichita.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.627
Why would you go to Wichita?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.999
How old are you?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.135
26.

09:29.703 --> 09:30.803
I'm sorry, Barney,

09:30.804 --> 09:33.039
but it's just no fun here.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.440
You're no fun.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.942
What do you mean?

09:35.943 --> 09:38.845
You get the oil changed
on the second Tuesday,

09:38.846 --> 09:42.448
your hair cut on
the 11th of the month.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.851
You never ever get
a different cut.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.453
Look at how you eat pancakes.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.587
What's wrong with it?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.856
How does he eat pancakes?

09:49.857 --> 09:52.458
He has a system
for eating pancakes.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.860
So the bottom pancake

09:53.861 --> 09:55.862
gets as much syrup
as the top one.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.464
He has a system for everything.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.667
Wally.

10:09.109 --> 10:13.312
The losing streak now
stands at four in a row.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.915
Kbaj now ends its broadcast day.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.886
The score again...
L.A. 5, San Diego 3.

a very pleasant
shopping experience.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.097
Yeah.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.066
Good!

13:19.067 --> 13:21.901
Here's a form for
our suggestion box.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.802
If there's anything you want

13:23.803 --> 13:25.071
that we don't have,

13:25.072 --> 13:26.672
just let us know.

13:26.673 --> 13:27.806
Arugula.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.376
I haven't had arugula
in six weeks.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.377
What's that?

13:31.378 --> 13:34.214
It's a vegetable.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.052
[Siren]

13:40.053 --> 13:41.820
Car 274 to headquarters.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.890
Car 274 to headquarters.

13:43.891 --> 13:48.428
Male subject apprehended
driving stolen green Chrysler.

13:49.696 --> 13:50.796
Hannah, we've got

13:50.797 --> 13:53.299
a grand theft auto for you.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.366
Let me at him.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.569
He makes the hairs on
the back of my neck

13:57.570 --> 13:59.071
stand up.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.573
On the back of your neck?

14:01.574 --> 14:02.608
Yes.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.977
That has never happened to me.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.579
I've never been
interested in anyone,

14:07.580 --> 14:08.981
unless I know...

14:08.982 --> 14:10.716
He's a college graduate.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.018
Yes.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.820
Ok, that probably seems
quite comical to you.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.422
Fine.
Suit yourself.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.626
I did... And look
where it got me.

14:32.739 --> 14:36.442
Tod wilkinson,
I'm Hannah stubbs.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.777
I'm the assistant
district attorney.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.879
How you two girls doing?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.880
What robbery?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.482
I borrowed a guy's car.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.086
He gave you the keys.
Is that correct?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.956
He was supposed to
leave them in the car.

14:49.957 --> 14:50.957
But he didn't.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.891
Right.
If he'd left them,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.161
I wouldn't have had
to jump-start it.

14:55.162 --> 14:58.130
How do you know how to do that?

14:58.131 --> 15:00.499
I learned it in the army.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.901
I was in the motor pool,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.004
and everyone lost their keys.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.839
The entire United States
army wouldn't have moved

15:07.840 --> 15:09.908
if I hadn't
jump-started it.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.179
And it came in handy
on several occasions...

15:13.180 --> 15:18.050
Jump-starting ambulances
in order to get invalids

15:18.051 --> 15:20.653
to the dialysis machines.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.998
What was the name of, um...

15:32.499 --> 15:33.799
What was his name?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.534
Eddie.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.469
Eddie what?

15:36.470 --> 15:39.105
I don't know.
He drives a blue Nova.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.207
You weren't in a blue Nova.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.808
It was a green Chrysler.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.045
Oh. Well,
that explains it.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.880
I jump-started
the wrong car.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.083
I was in a hurry.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.852
I was on my way to church

15:53.853 --> 15:55.621
to say some novenas
for Thanksgiving.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.956
Thanksgiving isn't
a catholic holiday.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.926
Thanksgiving is very big
with the Italians.

16:00.927 --> 16:04.330
Turkey cacciatore,
sweet potato parmigian...

16:04.331 --> 16:07.799
There is no such thing
as Thanksgiving in Italy!

16:07.800 --> 16:09.201
It's an American holiday.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.003
And I've been to Italy...

16:11.004 --> 16:12.404
To Florence, right?

16:12.405 --> 16:13.306
Yes.

16:13.307 --> 16:15.741
Ever been to sicily,
by any chance?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.044
No.

16:18.111 --> 16:21.047
Thanksgiving
is very big in sicily

16:21.048 --> 16:24.016
on account of the large
number of sicilians

16:24.017 --> 16:25.417
who went to America

16:25.418 --> 16:28.221
and then got thrown back out.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.325
There were two cases of
liquor in the back seat.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.626
People drink too much.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.563
Those two cases of liquor
were reported stolen

16:37.564 --> 16:38.997
from Kelly's liquor
on fifth street

16:38.998 --> 16:40.699
earlier today.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.101
You're kidding me.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.803
I accidentally borrowed
the wrong car

16:44.804 --> 16:48.640
of a guy who stole some
liquor earlier today?

16:48.641 --> 16:50.042
The car you stole

16:50.043 --> 16:53.512
belongs to the reverend
Malcolm dickenson.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.583
He is the minister of
the presbyterian church

16:57.584 --> 16:59.186
here in fryburg!

17:04.857 --> 17:07.593
Are you sure he's a minister?

17:07.594 --> 17:10.529
One of my best friends
makes his living

17:10.530 --> 17:12.431
as a completely phony minister.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.901
For 2 bucks, I can
make you a minister.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.703
Some guys steal your money,

17:17.704 --> 17:20.707
but these guys,
they steal your heart.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.288
Now? Can you see him?

17:36.289 --> 17:37.756
What's the license number?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.625
Ma'am?
E-n-4...

17:39.626 --> 17:40.527
Down the hall,

17:40.528 --> 17:42.261
one flight up to your left.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.196
Thank you.
E-n-4.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.497
Call me Vinnie.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.799
It says here your name's tod.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.868
Barney coopersmith, FBI.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.939
Hannah stubbs of the
district attorney's office.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.174
What's going on, Vinnie?

17:55.175 --> 17:58.009
You've got phony ministers
stealing liquor.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.245
Make me a minister.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.247
I'll go undercover,
infiltrate them.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.914
We'll nail all these...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.250
What have you got?

18:04.251 --> 18:06.952
Grand Theft Auto.
Felony theft.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.854
Where's the car we gave you?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.957
If I knew, I wouldn't
have borrowed the other.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.225
We're arraigning him.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.226
No, you're not.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.627
We most certainly are.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.564
This man is in the
federal witness program.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.367
He's under the
protection of the FBI.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.368
What are you doing?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.969
Just looking. Cute kids.

18:23.970 --> 18:24.970
Thank you.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.772
Baseball fans?
Yes.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.874
That's your husband?

18:28.875 --> 18:31.178
Not anymore.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.181
Come on, Vinnie.
Let's go.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.517
You're
a good-looking girl,

18:38.518 --> 18:40.386
except for those army shoes.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.987
No wonder he split.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.255
Come on.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.325
You ought to get a pair
of nice high heels.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.894
Spectator pumps,
I think they're called.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.329
Where are you going?

18:50.330 --> 18:52.431
This man is a member

18:52.432 --> 18:53.732
of an organized crime family.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.568
It's a stereotype,
and I resent it.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.571
He has to testify
at two major mob trials

18:59.572 --> 19:01.407
in New York in the
immediate future,

19:01.408 --> 19:05.010
so therefore you are not
going to arraign him

19:05.011 --> 19:06.412
for anything tomorrow.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.515
Now, wait just a minute.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.683
This is not a dump site

19:11.684 --> 19:14.753
for the toxic waste
of criminal America.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.288
That's my last mint.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.689
Spit that out!

19:17.690 --> 19:21.228
Spit that out and
return it to this woman!

19:38.778 --> 19:40.178
Bring him back here!

19:40.179 --> 19:42.448
This man is much more important

19:42.449 --> 19:44.850
than a couple
of petty larcenies.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.852
That's your opinion.
You don't live here.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.455
If I did, it would
be comforting to know

19:49.456 --> 19:51.056
a narrow-minded fanatic

19:51.057 --> 19:52.858
is looking out
for this community.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.059
Oh, really?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.661
Oh, really?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.195
"Oh, really"?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.464
Do better than that.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.065
You're going
to lose the argument.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.467
Stay out of this.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.935
How long have you
been in this job,

20:03.936 --> 20:05.070
two weeks?

20:05.071 --> 20:06.672
Go to hell!

20:06.673 --> 20:08.340
Just go to hell!

20:08.341 --> 20:09.741
Way to go!

20:09.742 --> 20:12.944
What if he promises
not to do it again?

20:12.945 --> 20:14.346
Tell her you won't.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.349
I didn't do anything
in the first place,

20:17.350 --> 20:20.553
which is what I was
trying to explain.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.492
I am not happy about this!

20:26.493 --> 20:29.928
Lady, this is justice
department policy.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.330
Well, they're wrong.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.332
They're wrong, and I'm right.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.733
Let me ask you something.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.703
Have you ever been wrong
about anything?

20:37.704 --> 20:39.237
Yes. Once.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.106
The shoes, right?

20:41.107 --> 20:43.443
The shoes are tragic.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.250
Creep.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.852
Disgusting, revolting, creep!

20:53.853 --> 20:55.521
I thought he was cute.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.724
Not that one.
The other one.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.764
Listen carefully, fluffy,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.766
'cause I'm only
saying this once.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.536
Tommy and I are going
down to grandma's house

21:10.537 --> 21:12.137
for Thanksgiving with dad.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.138
Remember dad?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.341
Yeah, he used to live here.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.744
We're going to be back
on Sunday night, though.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.947
Promise you won't flush
him down the toilet?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.549
I can't promise anything.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.683
Mom!

21:24.684 --> 21:25.817
I promise.

21:25.818 --> 21:26.952
Come here.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.287
You scared me.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.159
So what's up?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.495
What are you doing today, mom?

21:36.496 --> 21:39.097
I'm working.
Just as well you're going.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.766
I wouldn't be here anyway.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.369
Do you still love our dad?

21:43.370 --> 21:45.904
No, but I still love you.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.172
"And your dad loves you.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.907
That's all that
really matters."

21:48.908 --> 21:50.309
Mm-hmm.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.045
Hey, everybody ready?

21:54.180 --> 21:55.313
Hi, dad.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.448
Hi.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.451
Now go on.
Have a good time.

21:59.452 --> 22:03.054
We'll talk about this
when you get back Sunday.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.189
Bye, mom.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.190
Bye, mom.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.324
Hi, dad.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.660
Let's go!

22:09.962 --> 22:11.363
Love you, mom!

22:11.364 --> 22:13.632
Will?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.634
You shouldn't just walk in here

22:15.635 --> 22:17.469
like you still live here.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.805
I'm supposed
to ring the doorbell

22:19.806 --> 22:20.673
in my own house?

22:20.674 --> 22:22.474
This is not your house anymore.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.611
Of course, you always
clean in solitary.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.727
There's nothing in it.

33:49.728 --> 33:53.331
Last week I drove
43 miles to a restaurant

33:53.332 --> 33:55.933
I heard had good marinara sauce.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.535
How was it?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.104
Please.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.972
This is where you go
when you die.

34:01.973 --> 34:03.908
Everything's so clean.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.243
Everybody's so nice.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.912
Good we're not broke,
or we'd be miserable.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.214
I'm broke.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.282
But you get your check
every week

34:11.283 --> 34:12.784
from the government, right?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.156
How long you think
you get your check?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.824
Forever.

34:19.824 --> 34:20.958
Yeah?

34:20.958 --> 34:22.527
Here's to forever.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.032
What are you saying?

34:28.033 --> 34:29.434
Read the fine print.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.835
They only send you the check

34:31.837 --> 34:33.237
till you testify.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.273
Then they actually expect you

34:35.274 --> 34:37.176
to go to work.

34:38.710 --> 34:39.944
Bastards.

34:39.945 --> 34:41.147
Creeps.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.581
What the hell?

34:43.581 --> 34:45.183
We should go into business.

34:45.184 --> 34:48.487
There's enough of us
to start a crime wave.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.374
Hold it.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.816
Come on, come on.
Bring it in.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.419
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:29.094 --> 35:30.429
Hijacking.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.236
See you guys later.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.837
Good night, Vinnie.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.239
Take care, vin.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.241
Have a good one, Vinnie.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.243
Now, vin, remember, no speeding!

35:45.244 --> 35:46.377
Watch yourself.

35:46.378 --> 35:49.147
Ok, boys, back to work.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.795
[Siren]

36:08.767 --> 36:11.969
We are not accusing you
of anything but speeding

36:11.970 --> 36:13.971
at the moment,
Mr. wilkinson,

36:13.972 --> 36:15.973
but I'd like to know

36:15.974 --> 36:18.576
about the items in your trunk.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.644
Which items?

36:19.645 --> 36:22.513
Well, let's start with
the cassette players.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.115
I don't know anything
about cassette players.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.685
There were 40 of them
in your trunk.

36:27.686 --> 36:31.689
Oh. A guy I know
won those in a contest.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.124
They were part of a shipment

36:34.125 --> 36:35.893
hijacked four days ago.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.295
Oh, that's terrible.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.896
And the swordfish?

36:38.897 --> 36:40.298
I know this guy.

36:40.299 --> 36:43.301
His whole life is fishing,

36:43.302 --> 36:45.903
but he caught too many fish,

36:45.904 --> 36:47.572
so he asked me,

36:47.573 --> 36:50.575
would I keep
some fish in my freezer,

36:50.576 --> 36:53.578
but I don't have
room in my freezer

36:53.579 --> 36:56.180
on account of another guy I know

36:56.181 --> 36:58.583
giving me a side of beef.

36:58.584 --> 37:01.586
So he put the fish in my trunk

37:01.587 --> 37:05.491
while the weather's cold,
unbeknownst to me.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.665
Mr. wilkinson...

37:15.567 --> 37:18.370
Put the ball away and sit down!

37:27.279 --> 37:28.579
The books.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.348
You got something against books?

37:30.349 --> 37:32.750
I have nothing against books.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.852
I'm curious about the books

37:34.853 --> 37:36.687
in your trunk.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.757
You see, I was thinking
of writing my story,

37:39.758 --> 37:43.528
so I bought this book
on how to do it.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.564
Why do you need 25 copies?

37:51.503 --> 37:55.573
In case I want to
read it more than once.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.976
I'm sure it will come
as no surprise to you

37:58.977 --> 38:02.480
to learn these books
were part of a shipment

38:02.481 --> 38:04.081
that was hijacked yesterday.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.215
No!

38:05.216 --> 38:07.184
Yes!
Mr. wilkinson...

38:07.185 --> 38:09.521
How's the turtle,
Mrs. stubbs?

38:10.389 --> 38:11.722
Fine, thank you.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.725
Did your kids figure out
you switched turtles?

38:14.726 --> 38:17.328
I know it would be
a major disappointment

38:17.329 --> 38:19.398
for them to find out.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.733
Did you have a warrant?

38:22.734 --> 38:24.402
Know what this lady did?

38:24.403 --> 38:25.803
She whacked the turtle...

38:25.804 --> 38:28.406
This man appears to have been

38:28.407 --> 38:30.808
in at least three
major hijackings,

38:30.809 --> 38:33.411
based on what we
found in his trunk.

38:33.412 --> 38:37.014
Did you have a warrant
to search his trunk?

38:37.015 --> 38:38.148
No.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.550
Didn't even have probable cause.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.552
You had no right to search.

38:41.553 --> 38:42.720
Probable cause.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.889
Jefferson put that
in the constitution.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.290
Not for you.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.893
I'm exactly who
he put it in for.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.294
I admire your zeal.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.662
Don't patronize me.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.432
I'm the worst-case scenario
of Jefferson's dreams.

38:54.433 --> 38:55.600
This way.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.568
Presumably, the statute
of limitations

38:57.569 --> 38:59.570
will not have run out...

38:59.571 --> 39:02.172
I've been thinking
of advising this man

39:02.173 --> 39:03.574
to get involved with you,

39:03.575 --> 39:05.175
but I'm afraid I can't,

39:05.176 --> 39:06.276
because you're losing

39:06.277 --> 39:07.578
your sense of humor.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.179
You can't touch him.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.581
I can, too.

39:10.582 --> 39:13.584
If you ever had
a sense of humor.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.186
After you testify,
all bets are off.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.455
Everybody thinks
they're humorous,

39:17.456 --> 39:18.856
but they're not.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.458
You commit so much
as a misdemeanor,

39:20.459 --> 39:22.460
I'll throw the book at you.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.462
Ok, here's a test.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.031
What's the difference
between a light bulb

39:27.032 --> 39:28.634
and a pregnant woman?

39:30.436 --> 39:31.736
What?

39:31.737 --> 39:34.840
You can unscrew a light bulb.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.748
See? No sense
of humor whatsoever.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.097
Care for something
to drink, ma'am?

40:00.098 --> 40:01.231
No, thanks.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.633
Something to drink, sir?

40:02.634 --> 40:04.836
Let me borrow that pen again.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.506
What can I get you gentlemen

40:08.507 --> 40:10.107
to drink today?

40:10.108 --> 40:11.509
Ginger ale for me.

40:11.510 --> 40:12.910
Two double scotches, please.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.913
We're only allowed
to sell you two drinks.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.116
Two double scotches
would be four drinks.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.250
I see.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.252
All right, how about this?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.254
Sell me my double scotch

40:24.255 --> 40:26.657
and my friend his double scotch.

40:26.658 --> 40:29.059
Instead of putting his
on his tray,

40:29.060 --> 40:31.929
put it on mine,
and I'll pay for both.

40:31.930 --> 40:35.132
You look fantastic
in red and blue... Pam.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.534
All right, then.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.135
That'll be $12.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.537
Ok, and, uh...

40:39.538 --> 40:40.938
Keep the change, please.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.541
We're not allowed
to accept tips.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.543
Not allowed to accept tips.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.545
So your change is $8.00.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.879
Thank you.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.815
Thank you.

40:49.816 --> 40:52.416
Can I get you something, ma'am?

40:52.417 --> 40:55.019
Would you like
something to drink?

40:55.020 --> 40:55.954
Bye.

40:55.955 --> 40:58.155
You tip a flight attendant?

40:58.156 --> 40:59.557
I tip everybody.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.958
That's my philosophy.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.161
See, actually, it's not
tipping I believe in.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.329
It's overtipping.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.732
I think this is
the kind of thing

41:07.733 --> 41:09.333
people would like to know.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.537
Give me that pen again.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.876
American airlines flight 550

41:18.877 --> 41:20.878
for San Francisco
is now boarding...

41:20.879 --> 41:22.479
Vinnie, tomorrow morning

41:22.480 --> 41:24.481
you'll be seeing
the prosecutors.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.650
Tomorrow morning

41:25.651 --> 41:27.484
I have an appointment
with my tailor.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.886
You're going over testimony.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.487
Gaetano's expecting me
at 10:00.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.222
The next day you'll testify,

41:32.223 --> 41:33.624
after which we'll go back.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.226
Don't let anyone
know who you are

41:36.227 --> 41:37.628
or that you're in town.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.029
You'll telephone no one.

41:39.030 --> 41:41.599
If anyone looks like
they know you...

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Vinnie!
Vinnie!

41:42.601 --> 41:43.734
Welcome home!

41:43.735 --> 41:45.335
We love you, Vinnie!

41:45.336 --> 41:46.804
Welcome home, Vinnie!

41:46.805 --> 41:49.406
I don't believe this!
Are you crazy?

41:49.407 --> 41:51.109
Nobody knows I'm here but them.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.011
Shh!

41:54.012 --> 41:55.747
Shh!

42:07.425 --> 42:08.927
Mama.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.766
Vincenzo.

42:18.103 --> 42:21.573
[Speaking Italian]

42:26.845 --> 42:30.447
Undo my cuffs so I can
hug my own mother.

42:30.448 --> 42:31.849
I can't do that.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.551
Don't make me look
like a criminal

42:34.552 --> 42:36.921
in front of my mother.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.089
Mama.

42:41.593 --> 42:42.828
Mama.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.600
Oh, mama.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.169
Mama.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.906
MIO bambino.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.042
Mama.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.012
Barney.

43:16.662 --> 43:19.865
Hey, hey, hey, mama, mama, mama.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.994
I thought wankel invented
the rotary engine.

43:52.530 --> 43:53.664
Vinnie?

43:53.665 --> 43:54.665
Vinnie?

43:54.666 --> 43:56.001
Vinnie!

43:58.737 --> 44:00.238
Vaca.

44:22.527 --> 44:25.529
Where the hell
where you all night?

44:25.530 --> 44:30.500
♪ these little town blues ♪

44:30.501 --> 44:32.970
♪ are melting away ♪♪

44:32.971 --> 44:34.238
Vinnie, we're late.

44:34.239 --> 44:36.340
We have an appointment downtown.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.709
You see what I mean?

44:38.710 --> 44:39.877
Tragic.

44:39.878 --> 44:43.447
Barney, take a look
at the two of us.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.350
Take a look.

44:47.618 --> 44:49.619
You see, we don't match.

44:49.620 --> 44:51.088
You dress like this,

44:51.089 --> 44:53.190
you attract attention to me.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.458
That's dangerous.

44:54.459 --> 44:56.461
Wait till you see this.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.300
Wow. The worst.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.002
It's a pair of socks.

45:05.003 --> 45:06.603
Just try something different.

45:06.604 --> 45:08.873
Vinnie, I'm not
interested in this.

45:08.874 --> 45:11.641
Of course you're not.
We know this.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.010
If you were interested,

45:13.011 --> 45:15.479
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.748
No wonder your wife left you.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.417
She didn't leave me
because of my socks.

45:20.418 --> 45:24.021
The wardrobe is a symbol
of how you are.

45:24.022 --> 45:26.456
Now what do you think?

45:26.457 --> 45:29.226
Barney, listen to me.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.627
It's very hard

45:30.628 --> 45:32.897
for a human being to change.

45:32.898 --> 45:35.732
I am an expert on this.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.034
So, sometimes

45:37.035 --> 45:39.303
in order for a human
being to change,

45:39.304 --> 45:42.974
you have to change
from the outside in.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.777
Wow!

45:46.778 --> 45:48.645
You look beautiful.

45:48.646 --> 45:50.081
Come on.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.082
Tomorrow,

45:52.083 --> 45:54.051
as the provolone trial
continues,

45:54.052 --> 45:55.352
the U.S. attorney's office

45:55.353 --> 45:57.888
is expected to call
Vincent antonelli,

45:57.889 --> 46:00.757
one of the chief
lieutenants to gazzo

46:00.758 --> 46:02.359
until September,

46:02.360 --> 46:05.062
when he entered the federal
witness protection program.

46:05.063 --> 46:08.866
Look how young I look
in that picture.

46:08.867 --> 46:11.735
What do you want
from room service?

46:11.736 --> 46:12.870
Nothing.

46:12.871 --> 46:14.738
You got to eat something.

46:14.739 --> 46:17.407
What I want
is Linguini at Bruno's.

46:17.408 --> 46:20.010
A little Linguini,
a little scungilli.

46:20.011 --> 46:22.612
I'll get you some Italian food.

46:22.613 --> 46:25.015
You think I like hotel rooms?

46:25.016 --> 46:27.484
I'd like to order room service.

46:27.485 --> 46:28.618
Room 606.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.753
Do you have any Italian food?

46:29.754 --> 46:31.455
What does that Italian dressing

46:31.456 --> 46:32.857
come on, salad?

46:32.858 --> 46:34.458
Ok, I'll take one.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.326
Do you have pasta?

46:36.327 --> 46:37.828
Macaroni and cheese.

46:37.829 --> 46:40.230
Ok, I'll take one of those.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.566
What's this chicken volavent?

46:42.567 --> 46:43.968
Can you make that

46:43.969 --> 46:45.970
without the silky cream sauce?

46:45.971 --> 46:50.307
I just want it
in a flaky pastry.

46:50.308 --> 46:51.809
Ok, fine. Then...

46:52.878 --> 46:53.978
What are you doing?

46:53.979 --> 46:55.279
I'm wrinkling your jacket

46:55.280 --> 46:57.347
like you're
wrinkling your pants.

46:57.348 --> 46:58.482
What? Why?

46:58.483 --> 47:00.284
You bought a $1,200 suit.

47:00.285 --> 47:04.889
You hang up the jacket,
but lay around in your pants.

47:04.890 --> 47:06.356
You're wrinkling the pants.

47:06.357 --> 47:07.757
Give me your pants.

47:07.758 --> 47:09.226
I'll hang them up.

47:09.227 --> 47:12.029
What happens, the pants
go to the dry cleaners

47:12.030 --> 47:14.164
more than the jacket.

47:14.165 --> 47:17.167
You end up with a suit
that doesn't match.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.169
I'll use the pressing machine.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.438
Order me
the macaroni and cheese,

47:21.439 --> 47:24.808
and get one of those
little bottles of wine.

47:24.809 --> 47:27.144
I don't want to drink too much.

47:27.145 --> 47:29.713
Will I need change?
No. No.

47:29.714 --> 47:30.915
They'll have change there.

47:30.916 --> 47:33.952
I'll be back
in about five minutes, ok?

47:46.797 --> 47:47.932
Vinnie!

47:47.933 --> 47:49.400
Vinnie!

47:50.936 --> 47:52.270
Vinnie!

47:54.039 --> 47:55.973
We open up the truck.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.242
What is there but 6,000 watches?

47:58.243 --> 48:00.810
I think, great, 6,000 watches.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.112
What I don't realize

48:02.113 --> 48:05.115
is that each watch
is worth 10 grand.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.716
Now do your multiplication.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.585
May I help you, sir?

48:08.586 --> 48:10.188
I'm meeting somebody.

48:12.323 --> 48:13.323
Vinnie!

48:13.324 --> 48:15.659
$60 million would buy the bar.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.461
Eddie, make me a drink

48:17.462 --> 48:20.064
you made the night
Mary was shot.

48:20.065 --> 48:22.066
I think it was a bloody Mary.

48:22.067 --> 48:24.402
Psst! Vinnie.

48:25.670 --> 48:26.972
Who's that?

48:27.805 --> 48:29.140
Come here.

48:31.076 --> 48:32.209
It's Louie!

48:32.210 --> 48:34.678
Louie vinchenzi
from San Francisco.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.914
What are you doing here?

48:40.151 --> 48:42.819
This man's so fast,
he doesn't wear pants.

48:42.820 --> 48:45.555
It slows him down.
How was she?

48:45.556 --> 48:46.957
Give me the suit.

48:46.958 --> 48:49.359
I can't believe
you did this...

48:49.360 --> 48:52.562
A $1,200 suit on my credit card.

48:52.563 --> 48:54.364
18% on my credit card.

48:54.365 --> 48:58.735
I'll be paying it off
the rest of my life.

48:58.736 --> 49:00.137
Champagne for everybody?

49:00.138 --> 49:01.738
What a fantastic guy.

49:01.739 --> 49:03.707
I could've bought a new car.

49:03.708 --> 49:06.376
Don't get him mad.

49:06.377 --> 49:08.912
I can't believe you did this.

49:08.913 --> 49:10.514
Let's go.
Right now.

49:10.515 --> 49:11.915
This is my territory.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.317
Back to the motel.

49:13.318 --> 49:15.919
I want to show you something.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.521
You see those guys?

49:17.522 --> 49:19.123
Yes, I do.

49:19.124 --> 49:21.725
If they find out you're FBI,

49:21.726 --> 49:23.727
we have a problem.

49:23.728 --> 49:25.129
So, what'll it be,

49:25.130 --> 49:27.131
the motel and TV

49:27.132 --> 49:29.267
or drinking and girls?

49:38.743 --> 49:41.011
Know what I noticed about you?

49:41.012 --> 49:43.880
You never look them in the eye.

49:43.881 --> 49:45.015
Who?

49:45.016 --> 49:47.151
Girls. You're
a good-looking guy.

49:47.152 --> 49:50.020
You're a better-looking
guy than I am,

49:50.021 --> 49:52.556
but I always
look them in the eye.

49:52.557 --> 49:55.559
Therefore, I'll always
get laid more than you,

49:55.560 --> 49:58.295
which is fundamentally
unjust, am I right?

49:58.296 --> 49:59.896
You're into justice.

49:59.897 --> 50:02.366
This argument
should appeal to you.

50:02.367 --> 50:03.500
Come here.

50:03.501 --> 50:04.634
What?

50:04.635 --> 50:06.237
Leave your celery.

50:09.774 --> 50:11.441
Hiya, girls.
How ya doing?

50:11.442 --> 50:13.910
My name's Vinnie.
What's your name?

50:13.911 --> 50:15.045
Angie.

50:15.046 --> 50:16.646
What's your name?

50:16.647 --> 50:17.615
Marie.

50:17.616 --> 50:19.916
Marie, meet
my brother-in-law Barney.

50:19.917 --> 50:21.785
He invented that valve doohickey

50:21.786 --> 50:23.187
on the artificial heart.

50:23.188 --> 50:25.455
Don't ask me to explain it.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.324
Barney. What
a great name.

50:27.325 --> 50:28.925
They always say that.

50:28.926 --> 50:31.395
Look her right in the eye.

50:31.396 --> 50:32.629
Hi, Marie.

50:32.630 --> 50:33.531
Hi, Barney.

50:33.532 --> 50:36.200
What do you say we all dance?

50:36.201 --> 50:38.802
Oh, Vinnie, no.
I'd rather not.

50:38.803 --> 50:40.204
I want to dance.

50:40.205 --> 50:42.806
Do a little merengue for us.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.208
Merengue.
All right.

50:44.209 --> 50:47.211
Don't take it easy
on her. Let's go.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.955
You're too stiff.
You're slouching.

50:58.956 --> 51:00.224
Stand up like this.

51:00.225 --> 51:02.192
Buckle your knees a little.

51:02.193 --> 51:04.562
Move your hips.

Hey, Barney.

53:52.997 --> 53:54.299
Yeah, Vinnie?

53:57.134 --> 54:00.305
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

54:02.407 --> 54:04.008
In the bureau.

54:06.611 --> 54:08.479
Really?

54:09.614 --> 54:10.748
Yeah.

54:12.383 --> 54:14.619
You saved my life.

54:17.422 --> 54:19.489
You saved my life.

54:19.490 --> 54:22.091
We're in each
other's debt forever.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.894
That's so great.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.033
Good night, Vinnie.

54:30.034 --> 54:31.636
Good night, Barney.

54:33.838 --> 54:36.440
And what happened then,
Mr. antonelli?

54:36.441 --> 54:38.442
Mr. capelli
left the room.

54:38.443 --> 54:41.210
Did Mr. gazzo
say anything

54:41.211 --> 54:42.913
at this point?

54:45.450 --> 54:48.318
Mr. gazzo said,
"kill the fart."

54:48.319 --> 54:50.053
I apologize, your honor,

54:50.054 --> 54:51.921
but that's what he said.

54:51.922 --> 54:54.057
To whom was he speaking?

54:54.058 --> 54:56.059
Sonny, Frankie,
Richie, al...

54:56.060 --> 54:57.861
The guys who were there.

54:57.862 --> 55:00.464
Then they had a little eggplant

55:00.465 --> 55:02.065
Benny's mother made.

55:02.066 --> 55:03.467
She puts capers in,

55:03.468 --> 55:05.335
which I think's a mistake.

55:05.336 --> 55:07.804
Then they killed Nicky capelli.

55:07.805 --> 55:10.474
One behind the ear
with a .22.

55:10.475 --> 55:12.342
Richie loved
to use .22s.

55:12.343 --> 55:13.743
The bullets are small

55:13.744 --> 55:16.145
and don't come out the other end

55:16.146 --> 55:17.481
like a .45.

55:17.482 --> 55:19.883
A .45 will blow
a barn door

55:19.884 --> 55:21.485
out your head.

55:21.486 --> 55:23.086
Lots of dry-cleaning
involved.

55:23.087 --> 55:24.421
A .22 will just
rattle around

55:24.422 --> 55:27.491
like pac-man
until you die.

55:27.492 --> 55:29.093
Thank you,
Mr. antonelli.

55:30.227 --> 55:31.461
You're welcome.

55:31.462 --> 55:33.096
Your witness.

55:33.097 --> 55:34.297
Mr. antonelli,

55:34.298 --> 55:36.099
where exactly do you live?

55:36.100 --> 55:37.233
Nowhere.

55:37.234 --> 55:38.368
Objection.

55:38.369 --> 55:40.370
Mr. levine knows
perfectly well

55:40.371 --> 55:43.106
the witness is unable
to answer that question.

55:43.107 --> 55:44.508
I withdraw the question.

55:44.509 --> 55:45.909
Aren't you currently

55:45.910 --> 55:48.378
in the federal witness
protection program?

55:48.379 --> 55:49.513
Yes.

55:49.514 --> 55:51.515
You're living
somewhere in America

55:51.516 --> 55:53.383
under government protection.

55:53.384 --> 55:56.252
You agreed to testify
against Mr. gazzo.

55:56.253 --> 55:58.154
In exchange for this testimony,

55:58.155 --> 55:59.523
you've been given immunity,

55:59.524 --> 56:01.991
a nice house,
and a weekly paycheck.

56:01.992 --> 56:03.159
That correct?

56:03.160 --> 56:06.430
That's not all I get.

56:06.431 --> 56:08.698
Perhaps you could
enlighten the jury

56:08.699 --> 56:10.800
as to what else
the government's giving you

56:10.801 --> 56:13.002
in exchange for this testimony.

56:13.003 --> 56:14.138
Sure.

56:15.973 --> 56:19.175
I get to never see
my parents again

56:19.176 --> 56:20.810
or my loved ones.

56:20.811 --> 56:24.414
I get to live in a place...

56:24.415 --> 56:27.016
It's ok.
Don't get me wrong.

56:27.017 --> 56:28.518
The air is clean.

56:28.519 --> 56:30.119
The people are nice.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.789
But for a guy like me,

56:32.790 --> 56:35.391
who was raised on the sidewalks

56:35.392 --> 56:37.561
of a city that never sleeps,

56:37.562 --> 56:39.463
it's a living hell.

56:39.464 --> 56:40.564
There were times

56:40.565 --> 56:42.699
I thought of giving it up,

56:42.700 --> 56:45.301
particularly when
my wife left me.

56:45.302 --> 56:47.704
They gave us a nice house

56:47.705 --> 56:49.305
with flowers in front.

56:49.306 --> 56:50.707
It made her sick.

56:50.708 --> 56:53.910
But I made a deal
with the government

56:53.911 --> 56:55.378
to tell the truth.

56:55.379 --> 56:57.380
If you think I'm saying

56:57.381 --> 56:58.482
what I'm saying

56:58.483 --> 57:00.383
about Mr. gazzo
killing Nicky

57:00.384 --> 57:02.385
only because of the deal,

57:02.386 --> 57:04.087
you got a point,

57:04.088 --> 57:06.423
but it's still the truth.

57:16.133 --> 57:19.235
What's the difference
between a light bulb

57:19.236 --> 57:20.504
and a pregnant woman?

57:20.505 --> 57:21.905
I don't know.

57:21.906 --> 57:24.508
You can unscrew a light bulb.

57:24.509 --> 57:27.511
Michelle, a drink here
for my friend.

57:27.512 --> 57:28.912
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

57:28.913 --> 57:31.515
Have a Brandy.
Monks make it.

57:31.516 --> 57:34.518
Vinnie, we'll have
to work so hard

57:34.519 --> 57:37.386
next time we come to New York

57:37.387 --> 57:39.188
so it won't be a letdown

57:39.189 --> 57:40.657
after this trip.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.126
What a fabulous time I had.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.928
Although I got to admit,

57:44.929 --> 57:47.931
it will be good
to get back home.

57:47.932 --> 57:49.533
Barney, I've been thinking.

57:49.534 --> 57:51.535
It doesn't make any sense

57:51.536 --> 57:54.871
for you to have a problem
with that d.A.

57:54.872 --> 57:57.541
Get off my back
about the d.A.

57:57.542 --> 57:59.408
I'm not talking about romance.

57:59.409 --> 58:00.810
I'm talking in general.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.146
Why make war
with the d.A.?

58:03.147 --> 58:04.948
You're out of your mind,

58:04.949 --> 58:07.551
especially in your line of work.

58:07.552 --> 58:09.553
Try and make peace with her,

58:09.554 --> 58:12.556
a little gesture
to show you're friendly.

58:12.557 --> 58:13.957
Why make war?

58:13.958 --> 58:17.561
I mean, that's
my philosophy anyway.

58:17.562 --> 58:20.130
That's my philosophy.

58:28.305 --> 58:29.706
Hi, Mr. wilkinson.

58:29.707 --> 58:31.307
Hi, Mr. wilkinson.

58:31.308 --> 58:33.309
Hi, kids.
How ya doing?

58:33.310 --> 58:34.443
Hi, tod.

58:34.444 --> 58:35.845

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:41.464
At 1300 hours.

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:43.065
Synchronize your watches, men.

01:11:43.066 --> 01:11:44.467
We get to be Canadians!

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:47.069
I still have the witness
to look after

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.471
until he appears in court.

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:50.673
He has one more
court appearance.

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:51.475
When?

01:11:51.476 --> 01:11:52.608
In three weeks.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:54.343
This is a very
important assignment.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:57.346
You'll be out for
as long as it takes...

01:11:57.347 --> 01:11:59.147
Four weeks, eight weeks,
however long.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.750
I'll make sure someone's
assigned to your witness.

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:04.353
I assume that he'll
stay out of trouble

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:05.754
in the meantime, coopersmith?

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.756
He just fell in love, sir.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:10.959
You know how it is
when you fall in love.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.961
Sir?

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:14.731
Undercover!

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:19.101
Undercover.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:20.503
You can't even call?

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.104
We'll be stashed away.

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.506
You can't use the phone

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.908
for anything that's
not related to the job.

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:27.910
Someone could be
tapping the phone.

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.714
You could jeopardize
the entire investigation.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.018
But you just got here.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.765
Ok, fellas, this is it.

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:50.767
Let's go!

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:54.302
You're Harry redleaf,
and you're dicky thorson.

01:12:54.303 --> 01:12:55.704
You're from Vancouver,

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:58.306
and you're in town
to buy stolen goods

01:12:58.307 --> 01:12:59.908
from a major hijacking ring.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:01.309
They'll contact you

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.912
when they're ready
to fence their goods.

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:05.113
When will that be?

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:08.316
Not today. It will be
whenever it will be.

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:10.919
So, me and Barney
just sit here waiting?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.721
That's right.

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:13.321
It will be much easier

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:14.490
if you start calling each other

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.724
Harry and dicky.

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.126
So, dicky and me just
sit here waiting?

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:21.431
I hate that name.
I really hate that name!

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:26.970
Have a nice day
at the office, honey.

01:13:28.605 --> 01:13:31.073
See you later, darling.

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.207
Bye, honey.

[Blows kiss]

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:35.343
Jesus, look at this shit!

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.680
Oh, look at this rain!

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:40.849
Bring it back here, Epstein!

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.250
Back it up!

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.252
Pull it a little to the left,

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.654
just a little bit!

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:48.458
Take it easy!
That's it, hold it!

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:55.464
Ah, what the hell is this?

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:56.865
Where are the stereos?

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:59.468
How are we going
to fence this shit?

01:13:59.469 --> 01:14:00.869
Guys, what do you got?

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:03.472
We got two big spenders in town.

01:14:03.473 --> 01:14:05.474
We got nothing to sell them.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:09.679
What the hell are we
supposed to do with these?

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:16.019
How many of these we got?

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.291
See, you guys see a problem.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.794
I see potential.

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:31.868
Have a nice day.

01:14:33.537 --> 01:14:35.137
How you doing?

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:36.304
Would you mind us

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.540
leaving this bottle here

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.641
to raise money

01:14:38.642 --> 01:14:40.543
for the fryburg little league?

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:42.145
Huh. Not at all.

01:14:49.285 --> 01:14:51.120
Have a nice day.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.806
Hiya, kids!

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.282
I'll see you next week.

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:27.590
Lost track of how long
we've been in here.

01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:28.991
Give me some idea.

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:30.593
I don't know what's happening.

01:15:30.594 --> 01:15:31.994
We lost contact temporarily.

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.996
What are we supposed to do?

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:36.599
I'm wasting the best years
of my life.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.500
I got a wife and a family

01:15:38.501 --> 01:15:40.002
I'm not with, dicky.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.604
You don't hear me complaining.

[Video game sound effects]

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:48.476

and I'll kill you.

Hiya, Tommy.
Hiya, Jamie.

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:16.840
What's all that money for?

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:21.944
I don't know.

01:16:21.945 --> 01:16:22.746

I'm getting.

What can I do for you?

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:30.753
I don't know yet.

01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.354
Got to look around.

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:34.389
That looks really good.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:35.992
Take your time.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.127
I'll get chocolate chip.

01:16:39.128 --> 01:16:40.128
Coming up.

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:41.130
Okey-doke.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.668
It's $1.00, right?

01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:47.837
Mm-hmm, 1 dollar.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:51.607
Chocolate chip.

01:16:52.976 --> 01:16:55.177
You want the cone or what?

01:16:55.178 --> 01:16:57.046
I changed my mind.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:16:59.082
Sorry.

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:02.184
Maybe he'll put in night lights!

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:04.787
No, he'll put in
a dome and astroturf.

01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:07.189
Mom, you should've seen
the money in the bottle.

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.791
There's like trillions
of dollars.

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:10.392
It was our idea.

01:17:10.393 --> 01:17:11.794
Well, not exactly our idea,

01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:14.396
but we told him
how awful the field was.

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:15.998
He might put in bleachers.

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:16.800
Oh, yeah!

01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:18.400
And astroturf again!

01:17:18.401 --> 01:17:20.203
And maybe even a dome.

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:46.329
All right.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.275

repay my debt to society,

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.614
and you arrest me for it.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:08.616
He might be telling the truth.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.618
It was all for the community.

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.620
I swear on my mother's life.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.222
Let me do this.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:15.623

to give the money

to the community, weren't you?

Yes. Yes!

to the community.

When were you going
to give the money

to the community?

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.810

This is the new me.

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:49.825
He seems like a completely
different person.

01:18:49.826 --> 01:18:51.259
He seems totally different.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.261
Anyway, I'm not your problem.

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:56.464

going on right here

your time with me.

going on around here

to buy a ton of swag

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:45.214
and ship it out of here
in boxcars.

01:19:47.851 --> 01:19:49.352
Hannah!

Are you trying to make
a deal with me?

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.829
I don't know. Am I?

01:20:03.332 --> 01:20:05.800
There's no deal
if they're not here.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.002
They're here.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:09.337
If he said they're here,
they'll be here.

Yeah. Harry redleaf
and dicky thorson.

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:12.340
From Vancouver.

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:14.943
Did I tell you
they were from Vancouver,

01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:17.545
or did I tell you
they were from Vancouver?

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:18.546
Let's go.

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:19.948

Here you go.
Thank you.

They never leave the room.

01:20:23.719 --> 01:20:25.120
They just sit there

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:26.721
like they waiting on something.

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:29.824
Did I tell you,
or did I tell you?

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.226
What about male customers

01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:32.827
buying things for their wives?

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.064
They all watch Oprah Winfrey.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.234

ar... Rest.

I had no idea!

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:57.085
For once in my life,
I'm telling...

01:20:57.086 --> 01:20:58.686
The deal is off!

to build a little league park.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:04.292
And furthermore,

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:07.362
I'm indicting you
under your real name.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:09.164
Cuff him!

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:12.167
He has to testify in New York
in three days,

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.768
but he won't make it

01:21:13.769 --> 01:21:14.869
because by tomorrow

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.171
this story's in the newspaper

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:18.773
and every hit man
in America will be here.

01:21:18.774 --> 01:21:20.375
I seriously doubt that.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:21.776
You want to bet?

01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:24.179
I never bet when
I'm sure I'm right.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:26.181
Presumably you haven't
done much betting,

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:27.649
since you've only been wrong

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:28.783
once in your life.

01:21:28.784 --> 01:21:29.986
Twice.

01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:34.924
Hannah.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:40.996
There you are.

01:21:40.997 --> 01:21:42.397
Barney! Thank god!

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:45.000
You got to get me
out of this mess!

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:47.602
That's the way it's been
your whole life.

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:49.004
You spill your milk,

01:21:49.005 --> 01:21:51.006
and somebody else cleans it up.

01:21:51.007 --> 01:21:53.608
I'm not cleaning up
your mess this time.

01:21:53.609 --> 01:21:54.609
Lighten up.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:56.011
Is that your solution,

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.412
that it's
somebody else's problem?

01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:59.014
You steal a little swordfish,

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:00.415
and Hannah should lighten up?

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:03.418
You pretend to raise money
for the little league,

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:05.620
and the community
should lighten up?

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:07.022
Hannah turns against me,

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:08.423
and I should lighten up?

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:10.625
Barney... I've
upset you. I'm sorry.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.427
What kind of jail is this?

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.030
Oh, I don't like
to use this bathroom,

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:17.632
so they let me use
the office bathroom.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:19.034
Isn't there a guard?

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:20.435
Everything all right, Vinnie?

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.038
Oh, Jimmy, yeah.
No problem. Thanks.

01:22:23.039 --> 01:22:25.641
Come on in.
Come on in.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.277
Sit down.

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:33.881
You have a pillow

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:36.084
with your name
embroidered on it?

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:38.620
Yeah, crystal made that for me.

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.289
It's nice, isn't it?

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:46.961
Hey...

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:49.364
At least you never
got involved with her.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.966
I can't believe
I even suggested it!

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.568
Don't you understand, Vinnie?

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:54.769
I'm in love with Hannah.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:58.373
And now she hates me,
and it's all your fault.

01:22:58.374 --> 01:23:01.576
I'm so pissed at you!
I'm really pissed, ok?

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:02.578
Ok.

01:23:04.547 --> 01:23:06.348
Why is it my fault?

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:08.950
Because you are a blight
on this community,

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:12.687
and I put you here,
so she blames me.

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:17.692
Barney, I am sorry.

01:23:17.693 --> 01:23:18.760
Yeah, right.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:21.163
I am. Really, I am.
I owe you.

01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:22.630
You saved my life

01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:24.032
that night in New York.

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:25.833
I could never shoot at anyone.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.236
I never touched
a gun in my life.

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.838
It doomed me forever
to middle management,

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.441
and that's the truth.

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:36.744
I should do something.
What could I do?

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.146
Vinnie, don't do anything.

01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:40.449
Please, stop doing things.

01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:44.386
I have to make a phone call.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:45.321
Now what?

01:23:45.322 --> 01:23:47.655
I am entitled to
make a phone call,

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:48.923
am I not?

01:23:48.924 --> 01:23:50.359
Oh, jailer.

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:54.129
Should I use the office line

01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:55.763
or the coffee room line?

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.165
Our position, your honor,

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:58.566
is that we be permitted

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:01.436
to hold Mr. antonelli
without bail.

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:04.038
Every day he is on the streets,

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.440
he commits a crime.

01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:08.042
And while that may be all right

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:09.444
in places like New York

01:24:09.445 --> 01:24:11.446
where people are used to it,

01:24:11.447 --> 01:24:14.048
here in fryburg,
every citizen is a victim.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.049
Hear, hear!

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.050
That's right.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.853
[Applause]

01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:20.188
Mr. coopersmith.

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:21.389
Your honor, speaking

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.358
for the federal bureau
of investigation,

01:24:23.359 --> 01:24:25.960
our position
is that Mr. antonelli

01:24:25.961 --> 01:24:27.695
must not spend
another night in jail.

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:28.763
He's in danger.

01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:31.766
He must be protected
so that he can testify.

01:24:31.767 --> 01:24:33.568
We ask that you Grant bail

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:36.371
and release him in our custody.

01:24:36.372 --> 01:24:39.374
Your honor, this is exactly
what the FBI does.

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:42.043
It pretends this man
is in danger

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:44.446
when no one cares
about him one bit.

01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:45.847
There's all this melodrama,

01:24:45.848 --> 01:24:49.451
as if cartoon hit men
in white-on-white ties

01:24:49.452 --> 01:24:53.188
are going to walk in
and try to kill him.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:55.190
Obviously, this is
preposterous scenario,

01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:57.392
the sort of
paranoid fantasy that...

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:58.826
Duck!

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.663
Duck!

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:04.065
Hannah!

01:25:04.066 --> 01:25:05.568
Get down, get down!

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:10.306
You ok?

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.243
Move! Go to the stand!

01:25:16.245 --> 01:25:19.448
I got to get out of here.

01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:23.286
Follow me.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.458
Get going, coopersmith!

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.328
Vinnie!
Ah, where is he? Vinnie!

01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:34.929
It's all right, everybody!

01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:36.164
They're gone!

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:37.765
Use my car.

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:38.766
Great.

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:40.168
Oh, take my keys.

01:25:40.169 --> 01:25:41.169
Thanks.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.770
Take my gun.

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:44.105
Wow.

01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:45.507
You saved my life.

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:47.108
I'm in your debt forever.

01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:48.711
That's how it works.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.423
Take me!

01:26:01.624 --> 01:26:02.625
Get in.

01:26:05.461 --> 01:26:07.896
Just pretend I'm your hostage.

01:26:31.887 --> 01:26:33.688
I can't believe it.

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:35.891
You're actually building this.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.927
Yo, Vinnie!
Yo, look at this!

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:42.597
Hey, dino, Nicky, Benny!

01:26:42.598 --> 01:26:45.668
Looking good!
Looking good!

01:27:01.617 --> 01:27:04.218
Oh, mom!
Guess what he built.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:06.821
I know.
Ok, hold on a sec.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:08.222
It's so awesome.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:10.224
Hannah, Hannah!
Isn't he wonderful?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:11.626
Why didn't you say anything

01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:14.228
about this ball park
when I arrested you?

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.230
What, and ruin the surprise?

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.633
You didn't say anything
about this ball park

01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:21.002
because there
was nothing to say.

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:24.339
You arranged all this from jail

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:27.141
to avoid prosecution
for embezzlement.

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:29.243
Now that hurts.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:31.112
Because this was my intention

01:27:31.113 --> 01:27:32.647
from the very beginning.

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:34.882
The children needed a ball park,

01:27:34.883 --> 01:27:36.585
and I responded.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.721
See...

01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:43.691
I know how it feels
to be disappointed.

01:27:43.692 --> 01:27:46.694
When I was 7 years old...
No, 8...

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:48.896
All I wanted for Christmas

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:51.132
was a new red bicycle.

01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:54.569
My favorite uncle,
uncle alfresco,

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:59.474
swore to me that he would
buy me that bicycle.

01:27:59.475 --> 01:28:03.511
I counted the days
until Christmas.

01:28:03.512 --> 01:28:05.347
5:00, Christmas morning,

01:28:05.348 --> 01:28:06.948
I run down...

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.917
All right.
Nobody move.

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:13.220
This is just between
Vinnie and us.

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:16.157
Guys, I'm in the middle
of an anecdote.

01:28:16.158 --> 01:28:18.693
Come here and nobody gets hurt.

01:28:18.694 --> 01:28:19.595
Ok, ok.

01:28:19.596 --> 01:28:21.596
Come on, kids, move back.

01:28:21.597 --> 01:28:24.366
And everybody just
get out of the way!

01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:25.367
Take Vincent!

01:28:25.368 --> 01:28:27.201
Go, Vinnie!

01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:28.302
Aah!

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:29.904
All right, freeze!

01:28:29.905 --> 01:28:31.607
Hold it right there!

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.142
Nice action.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.143
Thanks.

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.144
I thought...

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.145
I lied.

01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.548
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes.

01:28:40.549 --> 01:28:41.949
5:00, Christmas morning,

01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:44.552
I run downstairs
and look under the tree,

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:46.454
and what do I find?

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:50.291
Uncle alfresco dead
on the floor,

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:53.495
shot through the back
of the head.

01:28:53.496 --> 01:28:55.797
Plus, no bicycle.

01:28:55.798 --> 01:28:57.399
It was a disappointing Christmas

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.866
on many levels.

01:28:58.867 --> 01:29:02.069
So you can accuse me
of many things.

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.871
But never for one moment

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:07.676
did I intend to rip off
these beautiful children.

01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:10.813
Isn't that right, Barney?

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:13.648
Yeah. Vinnie told me

01:29:13.649 --> 01:29:16.651
about this little league
thing months ago.

01:29:16.652 --> 01:29:18.252
And the only reason

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:20.054
I didn't say anything about it

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:23.257
was 'cause it was supposed
to be a surprise

01:29:23.258 --> 01:29:25.359
for the kids.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.564
Do you expect me
to believe this?

01:29:31.467 --> 01:29:34.101
Yes, I do.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.704
How about it?

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:41.743
Nice.

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:43.811
Very nice.

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:44.812
Hey, hey!

01:29:44.813 --> 01:29:47.214
Now, when you guys
are laying this sod,

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.282
remember,

01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:49.917
green side up.
Green side up.

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:50.886
Ok.

01:29:50.887 --> 01:29:53.320
Hey, crystal, I want
to show you this.

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:55.758
Now, what's going
to happen here...

01:30:13.509 --> 01:30:15.711
Fresh peanuts!

01:30:23.151 --> 01:30:25.252
Get ice-cold soda!

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.821
Hot dogs!

01:30:26.822 --> 01:30:28.389
Car radios!

01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:30.224
Peanuts! Peanuts!

01:30:30.225 --> 01:30:31.459
Cds!

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.060
Get your cannolis, zeppoli,

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:35.196
veal cutlet hero!

01:30:35.197 --> 01:30:38.833
Get the new best-seller,
how I got here...

01:30:38.834 --> 01:30:41.435
Adventures in a life
of crime and punishment.

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:42.837
Autographed
by the criminal himself.

01:30:42.838 --> 01:30:45.473
Are you going
to read it or buy it?

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:48.476
I can't believe I'm back
in this crummy town.

01:30:48.477 --> 01:30:51.479
