09:35.967 --> 09:37.391
Robert Loggia.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.635
Can you spell that for me?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.246
Certainly.
That's "Robert Loggia."

09:51.316 --> 09:53.592
Oh, God, there are reruns
in CutawayLand.

09:53.752 --> 09:55.927
I remember this one.
It takes a while.

09:56.087 --> 10:01.099
Longer than it took to get
my iPad back from Chris.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.326
What is he watching?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.829
BBC. Let's see
what's going on in England.

10:05.831 --> 10:08.440

10:35.218 --> 10:38.511
I'd rather be in the pancake ER.

10:41.299 --> 10:43.199
-What do we got?
-It was a bad flip.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.534
He got folded over on himself,

10:44.561 --> 10:46.386
so he's still wet
on the other side.

10:46.462 --> 10:47.871
-Was he the first one
of the batch?
-He was.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.814
Damn it! It's always
the first one of the batch.

10:49.974 --> 10:51.298
All right, get him in a room

10:51.360 --> 10:53.559
and give him 20 cc's
of Log Cabin negative.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.153

Just making sure
you're not Cutaway Joe.

18:26.589 --> 18:28.422
Hey, you know, that should be
your answering machine.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.258
Cutaway Joe to "Cotton Eye Joe."

18:31.319 --> 18:32.835
Call me back in three minutes.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.571
-Joe, we don't have...
-Call me back in three minutes.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.363
-Hilarious, right?
-Joe, we're stuck
in CutawayLand.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.031
-How do we get out?
-Well,

18:46.150 --> 18:49.127
according to a 16-year-old
autistic fan in Akron, Ohio,

18:49.245 --> 18:50.628
"In order for the Griffins
to escape

18:50.788 --> 18:52.946

"back to the original

18:55.360 --> 18:57.360
with Adolf Hitler and kill him."

18:57.387 --> 18:59.286
That's it!
We'll kill Hitler

18:59.305 --> 19:01.639
to prevent CutawayLand
and nothing else.

19:01.799 --> 19:04.550
But how do we get there?
Our setups aren't working.

19:04.668 --> 19:06.477
Well, this is where it gets
a little complicated.

19:06.596 --> 19:09.388
"In order to return

19:33.030 --> 19:35.064
Wow, Joe's instructions
were perfect.

19:35.066 --> 19:37.008
Well, who's going to
kill Hitler?

19:37.084 --> 19:39.568
Peter, I got to admit, I'm
not comfortable with this plan.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.571
Yeah, I know he was evil,
but do we really have the right

19:42.599 --> 19:44.907
to take the life
of another human being?

19:44.909 --> 19:46.742
Human being?
It's Hitler.

19:46.744 --> 19:50.763
Wow, the middle-class morality
of Brian Griffin.

19:50.881 --> 19:52.097
Hitler head, yo!

19:52.192 --> 19:55.267
He cried like a bitch
when I did it.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.236
Let's get out of here.

19:59.090 --> 20:01.014
We're... we're back.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.758
Meg, you saved us.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.036
Why are all these principals
in our house?

20:05.112 --> 20:07.854
(dance music playing)

20:07.874 --> 20:10.282
You don't want all these nuts
roaming the streets.

20:10.401 --> 20:12.693
Gary, another LaCroix over here.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.463
-GARY: Pamplemousse?
-If they have it, yeah.

20:19.910 --> 20:22.536
-(seagulls screeching)
-Peter? Peter, are you okay?

20:22.597 --> 20:24.296
Wh-What?
What's happening?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.873
You've been passed out
for 22 minutes,

20:26.893 --> 20:29.452
babbling about cutaways
and Hitler.

20:29.454 --> 20:31.896
-We were so worried.
-I wasn't that worried.

20:32.014 --> 20:34.548
Maybe you shouldn't have eaten
those raw oysters.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.901
I-I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let's just go home.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.812
All right. Let me take this
sweet, sticky Popsicle paper

20:39.930 --> 20:43.324
to that beach trash can
that has bees on it now.

20:48.272 --> 20:50.456
(buzzing in distance)

20:55.279 --> 20:57.162
-Damn it!
-(bees buzzing)

20:57.257 --> 20:59.173
