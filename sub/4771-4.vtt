00:04.880 --> 00:06.006
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.160 --> 00:07.844
- I have to go to Miami.
- Alone?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.082
This is just business.
I'm not taking Angela.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.250
You get this place running a 20% profit,
I'll give you a number.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.295
You're telling me you'll sell your stake
back to me, no bullshit?

00:15.320 --> 00:17.320
I guess Boy Wonder's not
wrapped around your finger

00:17.440 --> 00:19.681
as tight as you thought.
Damn, he's fine.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.444
Tommy moved Holly
into his place,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.331
and what's worse is this fool
told this girl about our business.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.290
I need you to talk
QDubs off the fence.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.920
You want me to be your wingman,
I'll go with you. I don't care.

00:29.945 --> 00:31.265
Yo, fuck you,
you bitch-ass nigga.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.965
This blue Mustang
was photographed

00:34.120 --> 00:35.884
the same day we recorded
the distributor.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.202
Tommy Egan may actually be
our Ghost after all.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.727
I'm an Assistant
United States Attorney.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.609
You're asking me
to testify against Tommy?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.649
It might be the only way
to save your dream.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.040
The girl who shot up the club
is hiding in Little Havana.

00:47.065 --> 00:49.002
All you gotta do
is follow Ghost to baby girl,

00:49.160 --> 00:50.446
shut her mouth before he does.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.126
Who hired you, Rolla?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.687

02:32.000 --> 02:34.207
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.169
Oh, shit.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.209
You like that?

02:38.360 --> 02:40.681
Oh, shit.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.287
Okay, wait, be quiet.
The kid's down there.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.044
You're the one
making all the noise.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.049
Remember
Isaiah Thomas, one of the great guards?

02:58.200 --> 03:01.522
Here you see the same moves
he plays with in the NBA today.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.284
Well, we've got someone like that...

03:03.440 --> 03:06.887
Howard Nathan,
number 34 for Peoria Manual.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.491
Marshall got here

03:08.640 --> 03:11.962
because of one reason... quickness.
The reason? Arthur Agee.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.646
Look at this man.
He just explodes, Dan.

03:14.775 --> 03:17.015
He can get downcourt as quick
as anyone that I've ever...

03:17.040 --> 03:19.520
- What's up, boy? You good?
- You want some breakfast?

03:19.680 --> 03:21.569
No, I want that shit
you've been holding for me.

03:21.760 --> 03:26.402
- Still got it after all these years?
- I just might. Let me go see.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.642
Your mama got the best ass
in New York City. Always did.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.451
Look what I found.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.800
What are you doing?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.122
That's for being loyal.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.890
Your shit is better than ever.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.769
Well, you know
that's the part between us

04:00.920 --> 04:03.366
that always worked.
You be careful with him.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.807
I got him.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.008
Shawn, let's go.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.486
You finally up?

04:29.640 --> 04:32.803
The rest of the house is already
fed and out. Come on.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.365
You didn't miss much here.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.807
Tariq's got this big
history project coming up,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.890
- Raina's mad at Harper.
- Harper? Who's Harper?

04:40.040 --> 04:43.169
Her ex-best friend. For today.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.007
So... that bitch
who shot at you?

04:48.160 --> 04:52.085
- She's dead.
- Same old Ghost.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.527
I love it when you
take care of shit.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.160
I didn't kill her, Tasha.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.207
Someone got to her before I did.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.289
Who?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.889
I didn't see the guy.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.440
He was outta there so fast,
it was like he knew I was coming.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.086
And the guy that contracted her
is dead, too,

05:13.240 --> 05:14.880
killed maybe a day
before Julio found her.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.202
That can't be a coincidence.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.681
I don't think so either.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.126
Someone wants to make sure
that I really can't find out

05:23.280 --> 05:26.170
who's behind the hits
on the drug business.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.285
The hit on me...

05:34.040 --> 05:36.884
Rolla didn't hire her.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.081
- How do you know?
- 'Cause she told me, Tash.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.521
Right before.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.607
No reason for her to lie.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.291
Who told you Rolla hired her?

05:57.320 --> 05:59.561
Kanan.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.605
But who knows? He could've gotten
bad information on the inside.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.441
- I don't know anything for sure.
- But you'll figure it out.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.206
I know you will.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.044
We'll figure it out... together.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.961
Hello?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.083
The guy who took up
with the RSKs

06:34.240 --> 06:37.050
after Rolla was killed, QDubs...
He's dead, too.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.089
I'm at the crime scene now.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.606
I didn't get an alert.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.762
You're not on the task force
anymore, remember?

06:43.960 --> 06:46.361
I'm your alert.
Is NYPD cooperating?

06:46.520 --> 06:49.285
- What are you hearing?
- I'm not hearing, I'm seeing.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.841
Got a shitload of blood
and bullet casings and footprints.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.163
Doesn't look like a planned crime.
It looks like a fuckin' mess.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.288
That doesn't sound
like one of Ghost's hits.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.363
The local says
the kid had a big mouth.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.530
If Ghost took out Rolla, maybe
he wasn't happy with his replacement.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.160
Ghost could be making moves...

07:05.360 --> 07:07.089
Wants to send a message,

07:07.280 --> 07:09.851
install someone in that area
who's easier to control.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.083
Now that we've linked Tommy Egan
to Ruiz's hideout,

07:13.280 --> 07:15.601
if we can pin Tommy Egan
to this crime scene,

07:15.760 --> 07:18.650
maybe we can prove that he's Ghost.
I need to come to that scene.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.689
- You know you can't do that.
- Fine.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.000
Can you get me surveillance
from the day of the murder?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.928
The whole area
surrounding the crime scene?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.161
Okay, slow down.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.767
You're my alert, remember?
You called me.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.127
You know
I'm onto something, Greg.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.441
See you later.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.080
Son of a bitch.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.728
Morning.

07:42.880 --> 07:46.248
Ghost is in the shower,
but there's hot coffee while you wait.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.044
Nothing happened
between me and your girl.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.608
You and Keisha are single.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.728
If y'all wanna do it,
be my guest.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.723
I don't want to keep
playing these games.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.646
I like you. You like me, too.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.485
And what if I do?
What difference does it make?

08:06.640 --> 08:08.927
It makes a big difference to me.

08:09.080 --> 08:12.971
That's sweet,
but Ghost and I are good.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.407
You and I are just...

08:15.560 --> 08:18.370
what we are. All we'll ever be.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.200
Don't get too comfortable, Shawn.
We gotta get to the club.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.084
Get at you later, T, all right?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.891
- Take that, Uncle G?
- Thanks.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.724
Just got our bank statements
for the month.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.405
- We should talk.
- We going broke?

08:34.559 --> 08:36.688
Not quite.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.330
Later, T.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.923
I know you said you'd call me,
but I just couldn't wait,

09:02.080 --> 09:05.209
so here I am with coffee.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.567
That's almost like
waking up with you.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.406
Yeah, except with more clothes on,
unfortunately.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.840
<i>Sorry.</i>

09:19.000 --> 09:20.490
You'd tell me, right?

09:20.640 --> 09:22.722
If something was going
down at work.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.120
Like what?

09:24.280 --> 09:26.647
I don't know, that Tommy shit.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.723
You know, Jamie,

09:28.920 --> 09:30.649
I wish I hadn't
brought it up at all.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.650
He's your friend and I shouldn't
put you in that position.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.844
It's just...
I don't want you thinking

09:37.000 --> 09:40.209
every time my phone rings
or I'm rushing or running late...

09:42.840 --> 09:45.810
I wanted to save your dream,
not mess with your head.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.611
Please, girl. My head is fine.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.606
L just think
you're wasting your time.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.407
So you won't testify against him,
if that's what it comes to.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.642
Nothing to testify to.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.765
Maybe. I hope you're right.

10:06.560 --> 10:09.166
We just need to be us.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.164
We're fine.
That's all that matters.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.405
As long as we're honest
with each other from now on,

10:16.560 --> 10:19.245
- no matter what, right?
- Right.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.286
Go ahead, do your thing.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.283
- Thanks, bye.
- Bye.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.049
Yeah, hey, what's up?

10:39.560 --> 10:43.929
You walk outta here, I will break
every single piece of vinyl you have.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.885
Doobie Brothers will be
in a million fuckin' pieces.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.525
Ghost just got back from Miami.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.762
- I gotta go meet him.
- Well, then, let me come.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.803
You can't come to a meeting
with me and G.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.923
First of all,
he won't want you there.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.321
Second of all, you're not
well enough to go anywhere.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.051
I was doing fine enough
to blow you last night.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.204
- You didn't get shot in the mouth.
- I hate you.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.206
I'm going crazy sitting here
all damn day and night by myself.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.125
- What else you want to do?
- I want to get some fresh air.

11:10.280 --> 11:15.002
I want to see other people.
I want my job back. I want money.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.289
Baby, I will get you
anything you need.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.205
I told you, I'm not good
at being taken care of.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.760
Yeah, well,
you don't have a choice.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.842
Now go get some rest.
Especially your mouth.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.810
You never know when it's
gonna be called back into action.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.083
All contracts signed.
Everybody's on board.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.762
Stern will be pleased
to hear you got it done.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.684
Will he?
Let me ask you something.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.808
How much did the club make
while I was gone?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.804
A lot. Almost enough
to get us back in the black.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.769
Fucking miracle
after that shooting.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.400
Give me a fucking break.
It's not a fucking miracle, it's me.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.403
You know that
and Stern knows that.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.289
We are very encouraged.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.410
Yes, in fact, so much so
that we've got something else for ya.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.449
You say "we" and "us" a lot.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.729
We've got a party coming up
for Vibe Magazine.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.848
Do you know it?

12:11.040 --> 12:13.520
It's a dud of an event.
No real VIP attached.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.889
And we've only got a small budget,
so our expectations aren't huge.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.971
So Stern gives me the black party
with no real budget to make it fly.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.885
Cute. I'm curious... why wouldn't he
give that to Todd over at Syrup?

12:25.040 --> 12:28.761
We think you'll be successful with it.
That's all.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.968
We really hope that you are.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.329
It would mean a lot for the brand
and for you.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.200
I was good to you
when you worked for me, Kantos.

12:40.240 --> 12:43.608
- Wasn't I?
- You were.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.682
I gotta get to the bank.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.761
Hey. Did you go to court?

13:03.920 --> 13:06.571
Is that surveillance for QDubs?

13:06.760 --> 13:08.569
Time of death's around 9:00 p.m.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.923
You have security footage
from a bodega, a bank,

13:12.080 --> 13:14.321
and two different mechanics
starting that morning.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.929
- Don't get caught with this.
- I won't.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.367
Thanks, Greg.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.365
Jonathan, it's James St. Patrick.
We met at the game.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.967
Look, man, I'm having a nice shindig
at the club Thursday night.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.969
Of course the guest list
is tight,

13:32.160 --> 13:34.925
but we'd be happy to get Jayson
up in the place and Yasiel, too, man.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.602
We'd love to have some pro athletes
of their caliber there.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.683
No, it doesn't affect
their image one bit.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.962
Look, Jonathan, it was
a one-time incident.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.566
You know? A woman got pissed.
She wasn't on the guest list.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.240
Security's been tightened.
You have my word, I can assure you.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.971
I understand.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.169
It's getting bigger, right?
Like coke rabbits are fucking

13:54.320 --> 13:57.563
and popping out baby coke bunnies
'round the clock.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.484
Tommy.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.962
- We need to talk.
- Welcome back, bro.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.043
Tell us what you heard
in the city of titties.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.565
- "Us"?
- I love that city.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.563
Best piece of pussy I ever had

14:08.720 --> 14:10.484
was this underage honey
from North Beach.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.881
Ghost don't want no pussy.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.686
He's got more than
he can handle.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.604
Now, tell us about this trip.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.410
The trip was fine.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.562
You said something went down?

14:21.720 --> 14:24.530
- You get it done?
- Yeah, she's dead.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.682
You tell me about QDubs.
How did that go?

14:26.880 --> 14:29.320
Things may have gotten
a little out of hand with us and QDubs.

14:29.345 --> 14:31.764
- What's that mean?
- That punk-ass bitch QDubs,

14:31.920 --> 14:33.649
he don't know when
to keep his mouth shut.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.640
He said there's no way they're gonna
work with the Soldado crew no more.

14:36.665 --> 14:39.011
And I tried, Ghost,
I tried to convince them

14:39.160 --> 14:40.810
that it ain't
about who likes who,

14:40.960 --> 14:43.122
but about who wants
to make money.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.408
And?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.881
QDubs and his...

14:48.040 --> 14:50.691
thugged-out bodyguards are dead.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.251
Shot

14:52.400 --> 14:54.289
Don't say "shot"
like it just happened,

14:54.440 --> 14:56.760
like the gun came out of fuckin'
nowhere and just went off.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.484
What the fuck were you thinking?

14:58.640 --> 15:01.689
I was thinking about you, G.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.366
Them motherfuckers was
all over your ass about this Rolla hit.

15:04.520 --> 15:08.241
I shot that nigga for you, man.
I'm proud of it.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.327
Now my crew can
take over that territory,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.761
single-handedly solve this
little powder problem you have.

15:15.786 --> 15:18.630
You see that, G?
I wasn't worried.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.081
Kanan's all over that shit.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.531
I still got to stop by Tommy's
and check in.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.967
Boss, the Wash 'N' Fold
ain't big enough.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.015
- We're running out of room here.
- I don't want to hear no excuses.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.690
It's a fact. Look around you.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.410
We gotta clean more faster.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.280
What about the nightclub?
When can we start

15:42.305 --> 15:44.148
pushing bills
through there again?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.201
I'll take care of it.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.441
Hey, babe.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.768
Tasha, there's less
than 30K in the safe.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.888
What do you mean, "huh"?

16:00.040 --> 16:02.361
The safe, it's damn near empty.

16:02.560 --> 16:05.962
Well, you know I've had to use cash
for whatever I can.

16:06.120 --> 16:09.249
That's what I was looking at this
morning, the legit accounts are low.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.841
And you know Tariq's
got all these fees for basketball

16:12.000 --> 16:13.525
and Raina's growing like a weed.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.047
She needs new clothes,
new shoes every other week.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.686
I gotta pay the rent
with a real check

16:18.840 --> 16:21.650
and the kids' tuition,
and I've been saving for that.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.964
And we got your first payroll check
from your job with Stern.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.488
It'll keep the lights on... literally,
and that's about it.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.404
So now I got two problems.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.800
Can't clean the drug money
like I did when I owned Truth.

16:33.825 --> 16:36.988
I need to make Truth more profitable
so I can buy it back from Stern.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.649
Well, what's the second problem?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.848
There's a party at the club
in a couple of days

16:42.975 --> 16:44.855
that could make the club
profitable if it works,

16:44.880 --> 16:46.695
but Kantos' stiff ass won't give me
the budget that I need

16:46.720 --> 16:48.200
to make the party
what it needs to be.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.695
And we don't have the money
to bridge the gap.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.121
Not legit. We got a warehouse
full of cash, can't touch it.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.891
- Can't use it for the club.
- Tommy would kill you.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.486
If Lobos doesn't do it first.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.490
Well, you just give me a minute

17:06.640 --> 17:08.642
and then maybe I can...

17:08.800 --> 17:12.964
make you... feel... better.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.209
What, you left your sippy cup

17:40.360 --> 17:42.200
when you skedaddled
outta here the other night?

17:42.225 --> 17:44.446
I made a mistake.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.200
A woman like you
don't come around often.

17:46.225 --> 17:48.273
Let me make up for it?

17:55.080 --> 17:56.650
Thanks.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.089
- What changed?
- What you mean?

18:01.240 --> 18:03.925
I mean, I really want to be flattered,
but I ain't stupid.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.280
What changed with you and Tasha
in the last five minutes

18:06.320 --> 18:07.890
that got you knocking
in my direction?

18:08.040 --> 18:10.964
It's not about Tasha.
I'm here for you.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.050
How do I know
you're telling me the truth?

18:22.480 --> 18:24.209
Okay.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.488
Wait.

18:26.640 --> 18:30.201

then you gotta slow down.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.880
With the shooting and all,
he's got me freaked the fuck out.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.207
Well, if Tommy's not here,
I'll just come back.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.131
No, come on in.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.851
I said you can come in.
You want something to drink?

19:47.160 --> 19:50.369
Yeah, I don't think Tommy would be
wanting me to come in here.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.522
Well, he's not here.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.160
And I got some beer
in the fridge.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.880
This the motherfucker I was
telling you about right here... Tommy.

20:02.905 --> 20:04.323
The Human Torch.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.920
I heard you blazed a motherfucker alive
not too long ago, bro.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.450
Asshole was trying
to steal my money.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.929
All right, so, look,
this how we gonna roll.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.527
Dre gonna run the point.
Y'all will answer to Dre.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.920
Dre, you answer to me and Tommy.

20:22.945 --> 20:24.754
And Ghost.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.768
Yo, man, these ribs
are off the chain.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.520
Y'all know how to do
this shit over here.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.927
This nigga.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.249
Motherfucker gonna want some
red Kool-Aid and watermelon next?

20:35.400 --> 20:38.927
You hear this motherfucker?

20:39.080 --> 20:41.481
Look, man,
just flash the bat sign

20:41.640 --> 20:43.400
when you're ready to take
that RSK territory.

20:43.425 --> 20:45.826
Tear that shit all the way up.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.482
Yeah, I'll let you know.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.448
Gotcha, Ghost.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.728
I need you to get
some hot girls.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.281
Give them each a grip,
I'll get 'em in the club.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.080
We'll make the money
out on the other end,

21:29.235 --> 21:30.441
come out clean as a whistle.

21:30.595 --> 21:33.529
Hot girls spending money in the club
makes the club even hotter.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.569
People talk,
more people come through,

21:35.720 --> 21:38.200
the club makes more money overall,
and I'll buy it back faster.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.800
How many girls
you want me to round up?

21:39.825 --> 21:41.608
How many can you get?

21:41.760 --> 21:44.889
Get as many as you can.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.530
That should do you.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.001
Does it?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.401
And make sure they spend
every goddamn penny.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.369
All right.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.520
Jonathan, change your mind

22:05.680 --> 22:07.967
about bringing the pros
through the Truth?

22:08.120 --> 22:12.091
Yeah, man, it's gonna be a hot night.

He ain't got a MetroCard?

22:19.280 --> 22:22.170
Yeah, man, I get it.

He was good.
You know what I mean.

23:44.720 --> 23:47.690
Held it together longer
than I expected for a college kid.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.286
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.455
It's none of my business.
I don't care what y'all do.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.055
You really gonna sit there
and lie to my face?

23:54.080 --> 23:55.605
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.364
You yank his leash
whenever you want to

23:57.520 --> 23:58.806
and he's so in love with you,

23:58.960 --> 24:01.327
he can't bring himself
to yell the safe word.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.768
You know what? Fuck you, Keisha.

24:04.960 --> 24:08.487
This is just like every other nigga
we used to talk to back in the day.

24:08.640 --> 24:12.087
- You just want him for yourself.
- It ain't even like that.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.562
- You gotta let Shawn go.
- I am trying to let him go.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.082
I told him it was over.
Ghost and I are better now.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.924
So now you trust Ghost?

24:21.080 --> 24:22.411
Just like that?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.364
He says he's sorry
and it's all over?

24:24.560 --> 24:26.881
He's the father
of my kids, Keisha.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.724
Look, I'm fine
with you putting your eggs

24:34.880 --> 24:37.360
in whatever fine
black basket you want.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.204
Shawn's a good kid.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.806
He's not gonna survive another ride
on your merry-go-round.

My husband and I stayed with you
a few nights ago

25:38.880 --> 25:41.850
and I think I left
a nightgown in our room.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.809
It's St. Patrick.

25:45.720 --> 25:49.122
Nothing? I'm so silly.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.123
I'll check my suitcase again.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.891
Thanks for asking.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.407
I did love my massage.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.091
Is that you, Tommy?

26:11.240 --> 26:12.640
Yeah, who the hell else
would it be?

26:12.760 --> 26:15.286
Hey, get your ass down here.
I got something for ya.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.930
Better be good.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.481
- It's good.
- No, let me rephrase.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.651
It better cook and be
a brilliant conversationalist.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.131
A puppy?

26:27.280 --> 26:29.362
You bought me a puppy?

26:29.560 --> 26:30.760
Haven't you ever seen a movie?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.251
Puppies fix everything.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.807
You said you were lonely,
so I got a bitch for my bitch.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.248
That's not funny.
She's cute, but what...

26:38.400 --> 26:40.641
Her name's Bell.
After Bell Boulevard.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.486
I think she's thirsty.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.563
- You have a friend over?
- What? No.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.002
Then why are there
two glasses on the counter?

26:54.320 --> 26:56.084
Someone stopped by.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.288
- Who?
- Julio.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.489
And you let him in my house?
And you got him a fucking drink?

27:01.680 --> 27:05.571
He came to see you
and I was bored and lonely.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.245
And it was water I gave him,

27:07.400 --> 27:09.846
not a fucking vodka tonic.

If they are,

27:56.960 --> 28:00.123
It says Mrs. St. Patrick
changed it this morning.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.890
She didn't give you
the new code?

28:02.040 --> 28:04.964
No. Can you just
let me upstairs?

28:05.160 --> 28:07.686
- Just let me call up first.
- What?

28:07.840 --> 28:10.764
If you're not on the visitors' list
and you don't have the code,

28:10.920 --> 28:12.800
I have to call up
like I would with anyone else.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.208
This shit is funny.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.800
Hey-

28:26.120 --> 28:27.690
No answer, sorry.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.561
But she's upstairs.
Of course she is.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.280
Look, Cesar, you need
to let me upstairs

28:33.305 --> 28:36.170
to my apartment
where I pay rent.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.961
She needs to give you the new code.
That's the policy.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.805
Look, we're not supposed to get
involved in domestic matters.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.167
What the fuck are you talking about?

28:47.440 --> 28:49.283
What the fuck did she tell you?

29:00.840 --> 29:02.842
Ma, you're not gonna get that?

29:03.000 --> 29:05.480
Eat your snacks.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.520
Ma, look, it's Dad.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.642
Give it here.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.040
You better not be trying
to call up this boy's phone

29:31.065 --> 29:32.245
trying to get up here.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.760
Tasha, what the fuck
are you doing?

29:33.785 --> 29:35.682
I'm so glad "Mrs. St. Patrick"

29:35.840 --> 29:38.002
enjoyed her massage at Eden Roc.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.084
Maybe she's the reason
you were too late to hit your target.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.088
Did you fucking tell her?
Did you fucking tell her?

29:51.240 --> 29:53.400
- Tell her what?
- That I fuckin' took Angela to Miami.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.406
No, Uncle G. I wouldn't do that.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.570
Fuck! Fuck!

30:10.960 --> 30:12.530
You got something.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.207
Guess whose car passed
the bodega at 8:24 p.m.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.125
Tommy Egan's.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.284
Can't see who's in it, but the make,
model, and plate match up.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.966
Are you gonna take it to Mike?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.248
Mike won't listen to me.

30:27.400 --> 30:30.290
He might listen to you.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.761
No. Angela, no, no.

30:32.920 --> 30:35.160
Mike already gave me hell
for helping you out with Nomar.

30:35.185 --> 30:37.526
This isn't about me.
It's about the case.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.411
It's about flipping Tommy Egan
and putting Lobos behind bars.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.601
Does that mean
you'll talk to him?

30:54.360 --> 30:56.203
It seems like
it's our best lead.

30:56.335 --> 30:58.135
That's the only reason
I'm bringing it to you.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.735
She's not authorized
to investigate this case.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.840
- I know.
- She shouldn't be

31:00.960 --> 31:02.121
anywhere near this case.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.726
Do I have to send her to white collar
in fucking Nebraska?

31:04.920 --> 31:08.402
Wouldn't stop her. Look, she's...

31:08.560 --> 31:11.564
She's wrong to be pursuing this.
She knows she's wrong.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.331
But she's passionate.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.201
What's you!' Phil?

31:18.360 --> 31:19.566
What? I don't understand.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.320
You want her back
on the task force. Why?

31:21.345 --> 31:24.005
Because she's done
some very good work here.

31:24.160 --> 31:27.369
And if she's on the task force,
you get to see her more.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.249
I'm not blind. And we both know

31:29.400 --> 31:31.641
she's the hottest piece of ass
this office has to offer.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.280
Mike, I'm not trying
to get the girl.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.330
I'm actually trying
to get the guy... Ghost.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.448
My interest here
is strictly professional.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.361
She can make a presentation
to the task force.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.808
If her stuff is good,
I might let her back on.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.803
But you're responsible
for her now.

31:52.960 --> 31:54.849
If you trust her with your career,

31:55.000 --> 31:57.128
well, we'll see
how that plays out.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.806
For both of you.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.560
Yo, so I got a bunch of fine-ass hos
lined up for tomorrow like you asked.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.966
Motherfucker!

32:08.120 --> 32:09.884
Tommy, what the fuck
are you doing?

32:10.040 --> 32:14.045
- Fuckin' trying to push up on my girl?
- Tommy! Fuck, man!

32:14.135 --> 32:15.695
Get the fuck off.
What's wrong with you?

32:15.720 --> 32:17.520
Motherfucker was in my house
while I was gone!

32:17.560 --> 32:19.528
I didn't touch your girl!
She ain't even my type!

32:19.680 --> 32:21.682
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Tommy!

32:21.840 --> 32:24.241
I don't fucking need you

32:24.400 --> 32:27.290
alienating our right fucking hand
over some bitch.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.283
Call Holly a bitch again.
Go ahead.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.966
Tommy, alls I'm saying, man,

32:32.120 --> 32:33.849
is you're about
to do Julio and do me

32:34.000 --> 32:35.280
over some broad you don't trust.

32:35.400 --> 32:39.291
- I trust her! You don't.
- No, you don't.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.120
Otherwise you wouldn't be in here
trying to fuckin' crack J's skull.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.481
Fuck that motherfucker.

32:44.640 --> 32:47.086
Julio, wipe your nose off.
Take a walk.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.568
Business. Focus on business.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.961
I can't even think
about business right now.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.003
Yo, let's go back to your crib,

32:58.200 --> 33:00.282
bust off a couple rounds
of "Assassin's Creed."

33:00.440 --> 33:02.681
Yo, man, let me
get my mind right.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.771
We can't go to my crib, Tommy.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.691
Tasha kicked me out.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.405
Fuck!

33:11.560 --> 33:14.086
Yeah, she found out
about Angela.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.001
- How are the kids?
- They don't know yet.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.049
At least I don't think so.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.645
But, look, man.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.043
You and me can't afford
to get distracted.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.531
Not right now.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.808
Gotta keep our heads
in the game.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.804
Kanan got the right idea
about this shit.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.042
No more connections
we can't just walk away from.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.846
Kanan got the right idea
about a lot of things.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.160
We gotta give his crew
the RSK territory, man.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.926
He knows what he's doing.
He taught us everything we know.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.082
I mean...

33:54.200 --> 33:56.965
how else are we
gonna move this shit?

34:20.159 --> 34:23.641
If you're looking
for my panties, it's top left.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.880
I-I'm picking up
some stuff for Uncle G.

34:27.905 --> 34:30.166
You should've told me, Shawn.

34:30.320 --> 34:34.928
He's still seeing Angela.
He took her to Miami!

34:35.080 --> 34:38.368
You knew. You fuckin' knew!

34:44.440 --> 34:47.523
- Look, I didn't tell you because...
- 'Cause you're loyal to Ghost.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.880
Because I didn't want to be the one
to break your heart.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.650
You were thinking
of my feelings?

35:01.800 --> 35:05.122
Well, you might be the only one.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.047
I can't take
anyone else lying to me.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.007
I can't.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.249
I have to tell you
one other thing.

35:20.400 --> 35:24.086
If this is about Keisha, I know.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.163
You do?

35:26.320 --> 35:28.243
It was one night.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.607
One night doesn't mean anything.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.686
But you told me.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.202
And that means
I can trust you, Shawn.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.524
Right?

35:49.160 --> 35:52.482
LaKeisha was a mistake.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.646
But I know that this isn't.

36:10.120 --> 36:12.964
Ma, do you know
how to tie a tie?

36:15.280 --> 36:18.602
- Ma!
- I'm coming!

36:20.920 --> 36:23.321
Before he died,
Nomar worked with a sketch artist

36:23.480 --> 36:25.482
to give us the following visual.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.881
Ghost...

36:28.080 --> 36:31.527
AKA Thomas Patrick Egan.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.604
You got positive ID
from a couple of pencil marks?

36:34.760 --> 36:37.764
We also have his car
at Ruiz's hideout

36:37.960 --> 36:41.203
and most recently at the murder scene
of the RSK's primera.

36:41.360 --> 36:44.409
Any video of him entering Ruiz's
hideout or the pool hall?

36:46.480 --> 36:48.847
So what you're saying
is we got a big steaming pile

36:49.000 --> 36:51.765
of circumstantial nothing.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.486
We have his voice
from our wiretaps.

36:55.640 --> 36:59.361
Nomar told us that Ruiz
was meeting with his distributor.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.124
It's Tommy... Thomas.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.970
And you know
this asshole's voice how?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.566
I went to high school with him.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.486
Tommy? Of course.
Of course you did.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.122
Judge'll love when we parade her out
as our trial witness on the ID.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.727
An AUSA authenticating a voice match
for herself is pretty much bullshit.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.161
I agree.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.210
But it's more than we've come up with
in the last week.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.761
Good work.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.242
I've already pulled background,
so we can jump right on in.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.607
It's just one big happy
family reunion, isn't it?

37:34.760 --> 37:37.445
He has been busted in the past

37:37.600 --> 37:39.841
with a few of these guys.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.480
This one, Vladimir Yankovic,

37:42.640 --> 37:44.768
runs drugs on the Lower East Side
and Staten Island.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.127
Street fight, no drugs,
charges dropped.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.288
Any ongoing narcotic
relationship there?

37:49.440 --> 37:50.960
Not that we know of,
but we're looking.

37:50.985 --> 37:52.563
IRS records? Ls he on the grid?

37:52.720 --> 37:54.688
He has a lease
in the Meatpacking District

37:54.840 --> 37:57.844
with Simon Stern,
the nightlife guy.

37:58.040 --> 38:02.125
He has that
and a chain of laundromats

38:02.280 --> 38:05.921
with a James St. Patrick,
another high school buddy.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.050
Look at that, Angela.
Getting more relevant by the minute.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.123
If this guy's clean,
he's one unlucky bastard.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.850
You want to be helpful?

38:13.000 --> 38:16.800
Log on into Classmates.com
and advise him to lawyer up.

38:18.480 --> 38:22.883
Egan is a good lead, Angela.
I'm reinstating you into the task force.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.283
Reporting to Saxe.

38:26.440 --> 38:30.411
Bring everything you've got to him.
Start with surveillance of Egan.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.847
We'll have to talk
to St. Patrick for sure.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.131
Is that yours?

38:46.280 --> 38:48.362
Mine's set to ding.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.291
You could turn it off.

38:55.440 --> 38:59.161
I can't.
Could be one of the kids.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.647
Do you think...

39:09.920 --> 39:12.048
Is it getting harder to do this?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.882
To just be us?

39:18.920 --> 39:21.241
We've always had the hotels,
the phone calls,

39:21.400 --> 39:24.324
the real-life shit.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.083
Unless there's something more.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.529
There is.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.082
It's Tommy.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.047
You said you wanted me
to be honest, right?

39:46.200 --> 39:50.125
So, honestly, I'm gonna do all I can
to keep this away from you.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.131
It's getting close to me?

39:55.280 --> 39:58.762
It will because
you're in business together.

40:00.960 --> 40:04.123
But you're clean,
so it doesn't matter, right?

40:05.160 --> 40:07.640
Of course.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.002
Well, since we're
being honest...

40:17.160 --> 40:20.130
you should know
Tasha and I split up.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.042
Is that why you wanted
to come over last night?

40:27.200 --> 40:29.089
No, I wanted to come over last night

40:29.280 --> 40:31.123
because I wanted to see you.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.765
I always want to see you.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.884
Because I love you.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.128
I love you, too.

40:48.920 --> 40:51.287
Why?

40:51.440 --> 40:53.841
Why now?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.890
She found out
I took you to Miami.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.722
But you said she knew about us.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.927
She did...

41:08.120 --> 41:12.045
- but she thought we stopped.
- Why would she think that?

41:16.240 --> 41:19.210
Because that's
what you told her.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.281
What, were you...

41:26.440 --> 41:28.204
reconciling with her?

41:28.360 --> 41:29.964
No, it's nothing like that.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.009
'Cause why else
would you lie to her?

41:32.160 --> 41:34.367
Why wouldn't you just leave?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.445
I just don't get it, Jamie.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.760
Why do you need her so badly?

41:49.560 --> 41:51.880
I don't get why you're workin'
so hard to bring Tommy down,

41:51.905 --> 41:53.410
mess everything up between us.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.528
Don't turn this around on me.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.887
I am not trying
to mess everything up.

41:58.040 --> 42:01.249
I am trying to put
a drug dealer in jail.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.210
That would be yours.

42:28.800 --> 42:31.690
Let's start over again tonight.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.571
Wake up together tomorrow.

42:40.880 --> 42:43.486
We're gonna be okay?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.122
Yeah, we are.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.364
Thanks for making
my case to Mike.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.284
Mike said if you fuck up now,
it's on me.

43:02.440 --> 43:04.204
I'll get the heat
if you bring us down.

43:04.360 --> 43:07.762
Greg, you can trust me. I know
what I'm doing this time, I promise.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.923
Look... look, Angela,
I helped you

43:13.080 --> 43:16.687
because I think you're onto something
with Egan, all right? I do.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.880
But if I'm being honest,
that's not the only reason.

43:27.120 --> 43:31.444
Is it weird at all for you,
you know, us working together?

43:33.400 --> 43:36.324
- No, not really.
- Okay.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.680
Are you seeing something?

43:42.840 --> 43:44.695
- Tell me, what are you seeing?
- Most of the people

43:44.720 --> 43:46.960
coming out of this building
are the artsy type, you know?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.240
- There's a woman coming out now.
- What's she look like?

43:49.320 --> 43:53.041
Thin, 20s, hot.
A little slutty, actually.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.567
- What color hair?
- Red.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.131
I bet that's Tommy's girl.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.891
He had this creepy thing
in high school for redheads.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.769
Why is that creepy?

44:01.920 --> 44:03.968
His mom is a redhead.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.969
Get her picture.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.444
You could be wrong, you know.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.922
She could just be some nice girl
who has no idea who she's dating.

44:19.080 --> 44:22.129
There is zero chance Tommy Egan
is dating a nice girl.

44:22.280 --> 44:24.726
Send me her picture.
I'll get to work.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.768
It's been a while since I've been
summoned somewhere.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.730
Unless you count
the shitter or mealtime.

44:46.880 --> 44:49.281
Me asking if you want to talk
is different, right?

44:51.200 --> 44:53.806
Want a drink?

44:56.440 --> 44:59.011
The bitch in Miami...

44:59.160 --> 45:01.401
that bitch is dead.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.040
You know,
the one that Rolla hired.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.646
Yeah, how'd she go down?

45:07.680 --> 45:10.001
Easy.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.085
Well, problem solved.
Business can get crackin'.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.608
But you know
how this business is, K.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.200
As soon as you
take out one threat...

45:20.240 --> 45:22.481
another one pops up.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.723
- Fuckin' circle of life.
- Well, you did what needed to be done.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.646
It's the kind of shit it takes
to succeed in this business, kiddo.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.723
You did me well.

45:31.880 --> 45:35.805
Back in the day,
and again, giving me Rolla's name.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.083
Killin' QDubs to save my ass.

45:39.240 --> 45:42.050
You hit hard
and you don't flinch.

45:42.200 --> 45:45.124
That's how I know
I can trust you.

45:49.840 --> 45:53.083
You and your crew
run RSK's old stand.

45:53.240 --> 45:55.720
That's the right move.

45:58.480 --> 46:01.006
I'll take that drink
if you're still offering.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.244
Scotch. Single malt.
Best you got.

46:06.400 --> 46:09.404
- You want me to put it on your room?
- You staying here?

46:11.800 --> 46:13.928
You and Tasha going through
a rough patch?

46:14.120 --> 46:17.169
Y'all so close, always
doing everything together.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.484
Shit'll work itself out.
Always does, right?

46:47.160 --> 46:48.446
Hi.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.728
He has been working
on this for days.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.609
We're so proud of him.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.250
I'm gonna go get your backpack

46:54.400 --> 46:56.320
and then we can go home
and celebrate, all right?

46:56.345 --> 46:57.676
- Okay.
- Thank you.

47:11.760 --> 47:13.171
Listen, Tasha, we need to talk.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.971
Fuck that.
I don't need anything from you.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.360
Listen to me.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.801
I think Kanan
got the girl hit in Miami.

47:19.960 --> 47:23.203
I think Kanan's been behind all
the hits on our business the whole time.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.165
I think it's revenge.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.567
I gotta feel him out more
to be sure,

47:30.720 --> 47:32.655
so I'm gonna pull him in closer,
you know, so I can keep an eye...

47:32.680 --> 47:34.250
We're not partners
anymore, Ghost.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.926
You made that clear.
You know what? Call Tommy.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.168
Tommy's head's all fucked up
over his girl.

47:39.320 --> 47:43.006
I don't know, it feels like he drunk
the Kanan Kool-Aid.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.970
You're the only person
I can trust.

47:46.120 --> 47:48.043
Uni-rust"?

47:50.960 --> 47:54.169
Is that what we have, Ghost?
Trust?

47:54.320 --> 47:56.766
You're not listening to me.
I gotta spell it out?

47:56.920 --> 48:00.129
I think Kanan knows
we sent him to jail.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.682
You and me, T.
He's coming after us.

48:07.880 --> 48:11.521
It started with the hits,
but I can't see his next move.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.044
So I gotta come home

48:18.200 --> 48:21.727
so I can protect you
and the kids.

48:25.200 --> 48:29.205
You'd use Kanan to try to trick me
into letting you come home?

48:29.360 --> 48:30.850
You think I'm stupid?

48:31.000 --> 48:33.002
You know what?
I was for a while.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.004
But not anymore.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.481
You ain't never
comin' home, Ghost.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.889
- You can let that dream go.
- Come here.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.327
Don't tell me to fucking let go.

48:45.320 --> 48:48.722
You better let me go before
I scream this whole place down

48:48.880 --> 48:51.451
and get you kicked
out of here, too.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.329
How's your arm? All right?

49:26.520 --> 49:27.931
Getting better.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.491
Tommy know where you are?

49:29.640 --> 49:31.722
No, we had a fight.

49:31.880 --> 49:33.530
He's out of his
fucking mind sometimes.

49:33.680 --> 49:38.322
That's for sure.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.960
There's a combination
to a storage locker in Midtown.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.844
Bag full of cash.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.050
- You want me to drop it off someplace?
- I want you to disappear.

49:50.680 --> 49:52.720
There's a train ticket inside.
Train leaves tonight.

49:52.745 --> 49:56.008
Are you fucking kidding me?

49:56.160 --> 49:58.288
I'm not just leaving
because you say so.

49:58.440 --> 50:02.764
I need you to try harder
to understand what I'm saying.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.287
You stole from my house, Holly.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.721
You broke Tommy's trust
when you called me Ghost.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.611
You got my boy all fucked up.
You're a liability.

50:14.160 --> 50:16.162
It's time for you to go,
one way or the other.

50:16.360 --> 50:20.922
If I don't come back, Tommy's
not gonna just forget about me.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.851
He's gonna look for me.
He'll go crazy.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.480
I'll give you a couple days
to break up with him.

50:31.505 --> 50:34.808
This time, have a really big fight.
Walk out on him for good.

50:34.960 --> 50:38.089
I'll hold the combination for the cash
till you come back to me.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.004
And I'll have the date
on the ticket changed.

50:40.160 --> 50:42.731
I'll even give you a lift
to the station. Sound good?

50:44.400 --> 50:46.289
If you tell Tommy
we had this conversation,

50:46.480 --> 50:48.040
I'll deny it ever happened.
We both know

50:48.065 --> 50:50.645
he won't believe you over me.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.768

with buying you a drink?

52:30.320 --> 52:32.527

52:39.840 --> 52:41.649

Made it work.
Did whatever it takes.

to actually get us back in the black.
