it was easier for her.

their beliefs aside to be there for me.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.495
- Look, you know what? It's okay.

15:11.495 --> 15:14.623
Because Benji told me that I, I can
tell people I trust, and I trust you.

15:16.041 --> 15:21.129

- Look, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
All right? I tried. I really did.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.144
- I threw a party last night

24:37.144 --> 24:40.355
because I had a feeling that
the answer would be no.

24:41.315 --> 24:45.944
And I wanted to pack in one last
crazy high school memory

24:45.944 --> 24:50.365
with my boyfriend
before I... ran out of time,

24:52.534 --> 24:54.036

- Mia, you have to understand that--
- No, but, Dad,

24:58.790 --> 25:02.377
you have done so much
for me over the years,

25:02.377 --> 25:04.296
but you've also had to be away a lot, too.

25:05.380 --> 25:09.218
Which meant that other people
had to step in and take care of me.

25:10.010 --> 25:13.305
All right, I mean, you were in London
when my appendix burst,

25:13.305 --> 25:15.307
and Andrew's dad had
to drive me to the hospital,

25:15.307 --> 25:20.145
and... and Lake's mom
taught me how to drive.
