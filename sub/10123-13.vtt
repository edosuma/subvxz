DO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER SET OF CHILDREN

19:11.867 --> 19:13.033
IN MUNCIE, INDIANA?

19:13.033 --> 19:14.367
ARE VERA, CHUCK,
AND DAVE

19:14.367 --> 19:16.200
WAITING FOR THEIR MOTHER
TO COME BACK

19:16.200 --> 19:19.400
AFTER STEPPING OUT
FOR GUM 18 YEARS AGO?

19:19.400 --> 19:20.934
"SO THE VELVETEEN
RABBIT SAID,

19:20.934 --> 19:23.900
<i>I </i>AM
<i>A REAL RABBIT."</i>

19:23.900 --> 19:24.900
ALAN.

19:24.900 --> 19:28.300
AMY, IF THAT'S
YOUR REAL NAME.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.000
CORY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.800
NO ONE ELSE IS TO BLAME
EXCEPT ME.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.934
BUT DON'T WORRY, DAD.

19:34.934 --> 19:36.834
I'M GOING TO PAY FOR IT
OUT OF MY OWN MONEY.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.000
YOUR OWN MONEY?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.600
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO DO THAT?

19:39.600 --> 19:40.934
WELL, I WOULD TELL YOU,

19:40.934 --> 19:42.233
BUT THE YELLING
AND SCREAMING

19:42.233 --> 19:43.233
THAT WOULD HAPPEN

19:43.233 --> 19:44.867
WOULD ONLY WAKE UP
MY DEAR LITTLE SISTER,

19:44.867 --> 19:48.133
WHO, THANK GOD,
IS STILL ALIVE.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.500
WELL, BASED ON
PERFORMANCE FIGURES TO DATE,

19:52.500 --> 19:57.000
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH
THE MATTHEWS-HUNTER CONSORTIUM

19:57.000 --> 20:00.100
IS OUR MOST PROFITABLE
CORPORATION.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.500
SO, GENTLEMEN,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.000
DO YOU HAVE
ANY BUSINESS TIPS

20:03.000 --> 20:05.500
FOR OUR OTHER
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS?

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
YEAH.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.100
SOME PEOPLE
BET ON A JOCKEY.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.567
I SAY,
"GIVE ME A HORSE

20:11.567 --> 20:14.867
THAT CAN RUN
IN THE MUD."

20:14.867 --> 20:18.300
OH, BRAVO.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.300
ANYTHING TO ADD,
MR. MATTHEWS?

20:20.300 --> 20:21.300
YES.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.567
THE GREATER THE RISK,

20:22.567 --> 20:24.000
THE GREATER
THE POTENTIAL PROFIT.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.300
JUST LIKE YOU
TAUGHT US, MR. FEENY.

20:26.300 --> 20:29.000
YES, BUT SOMETIMES
THE GLITTER OF THE PROFIT

20:29.000 --> 20:31.734
MAKES ONE LOSE SIGHT
OF THE RISK.

20:31.734 --> 20:34.400
AND YOU SHOULD
NEVER GAMBLE ANYTHING

20:34.400 --> 20:36.667
THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.300
I DIDN'T TEACH YOU THAT.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.400
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.900
I KIND OF MANAGED
TO TRIP OVER THAT ONE MYSELF.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.367
[BELL RINGS]

20:52.300 --> 20:53.367
YOU KNOW, STU,

20:53.367 --> 20:55.500
I WAS SO BUSY COUNTING
MONEY YESTERDAY,

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
I COMPLETELY FORGOT

20:56.500 --> 20:58.834
TO GIVE YOU
YOUR VALENTINE.

20:58.834 --> 20:59.900
SO...

20:59.900 --> 21:00.867
HERE.

21:00.867 --> 21:05.033
NO HARD FEELINGS,
EH, BIG BRAIN?

21:05.033 --> 21:06.233
SHOULD I OPEN IT?

21:06.233 --> 21:08.867
I KNOW IT'S JUST GOING
TO BE INSULTING AND MEAN.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.834
STICKS AND STONES
MAY BREAK YOUR BONES,

21:11.834 --> 21:13.800
BUT WORDS
CAN NEVER HURT YOU.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.900
I MADE THAT UP.

21:22.467 --> 21:25.200
MM-HMM.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.934
"HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY."

21:26.934 --> 21:28.400
AH.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.500
"TURN AROUND."

21:51.200 --> 21:52.967
HERE, MOM.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.100
WHAT'S THIS?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.400
IT'S ALL THE MONEY
SHAWN AND I HAD LEFT OVER

21:56.400 --> 21:59.200
AFTER WE PAID FOR
THE VASE AND THE DOOR.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.900
AND YOU SPENT IT ON ME?

22:00.900 --> 22:03.767
EASY COME, EASY GO.

22:07.934 --> 22:11.400
IS THAT FROM
MARK BRAITHWAITE?

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
NO.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.934
IT'S FROM
CORY MATTHEWS.

22:14.934 --> 22:19.400
WELL, IN CASE
IT GETS LONELY.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.734
POOH-BEAR,
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

22:23.734 --> 22:24.834
WHY?

22:24.834 --> 22:27.934
BECAUSE THIS WAS
THE WORST VALENTINE'S DAY

22:27.934 --> 22:28.967
OF MY LIFE.

22:28.967 --> 22:30.767
INCLUDING THE TIME
THAT MARGIE DWYER

22:30.767 --> 22:33.367
TOLD ALL THE GIRLS IN
FIFTH GRADE I HAD COOTIES,

22:33.367 --> 22:35.500
AND THEY
THREW MY CARDS AWAY.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.367
OH.

22:37.367 --> 22:38.400
AND I WAS THINKING

22:38.400 --> 22:41.200
THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
PROPOSED TO TWICE,

22:41.200 --> 22:43.934
BUT YOU ONLY
SAID YES ONCE,

22:43.934 --> 22:47.233
AND I'M GLAD IT WAS ME.

22:47.233 --> 22:50.200
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY,
BOOM-BOOM.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.200
SO...

22:56.467 --> 22:57.767
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

22:57.767 --> 23:00.300
I WAS ONLY
PROPOSED TO TWICE?
