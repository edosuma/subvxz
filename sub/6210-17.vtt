00:02.201 --> 00:04.703
The day is alive with the wonder
of Wednesday.
( scoffs )

00:04.704 --> 00:08.273
To me, it's just another day
with eight nipples.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.374
What's wrong?

00:09.375 --> 00:12.043
I can't remember
what it was like to be human.

00:12.044 --> 00:13.644
This voice used to
bark orders

00:13.645 --> 00:15.146
to a legion
of mercenaries.

00:15.147 --> 00:17.915
Now it begs
two old maids for catnip.

00:19.118 --> 00:21.152
I believe the correct
term is "spinsters."

00:21.153 --> 00:22.921
Come on, you big wuss,
suck it up.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.622
Take it like the man
you used to be.

00:24.623 --> 00:26.991
( sobs )
I know what you
can't resist.

00:26.992 --> 00:28.693
ZELDA:
Your favorite cat toy.

00:28.694 --> 00:30.528
I don't need
your pity.

00:32.497 --> 00:35.633
This is serious. Usually
he thrives on our pity.

00:35.634 --> 00:37.636
Oh. let's go see if he
wants his tummy rubbed.

00:39.972 --> 00:40.872
ZELDA:
You coming, Hilda?

00:40.873 --> 00:42.573
Huh? Oh,
I'm sorry. Eh.

00:42.574 --> 00:44.709
It is irresistible.

Get your peanut butter
dandies here,

01:11.637 --> 01:14.238
compliments of the committee to
elect Willard Kraft principal.

01:14.239 --> 01:16.173
Here you go.
Tell your folks

01:16.174 --> 01:17.575
to vote early and often.

01:17.576 --> 01:19.577
Is it true
Principal Larue is out?

01:19.578 --> 01:22.213
Well, not yet.
But his contract is up.

01:22.214 --> 01:24.115
so I'm throwing
my hat in the ring.

01:24.116 --> 01:28.285
Why? Because I want
that extra $418 a year.

01:28.286 --> 01:30.555
And with you in charge,
the cheerleaders

01:30.556 --> 01:33.124
can finally gain power
of attorney over the dance fund.

01:33.125 --> 01:36.394
Mm-hm. If I can lure enough
votes with my dandies.

01:36.395 --> 01:37.595
Here you go, Libby.

01:37.596 --> 01:39.597
Ew.

01:39.598 --> 01:41.031
Maybe if you offered them
with milk.

01:41.032 --> 01:42.500
( snaps )
Excellent idea.

01:42.501 --> 01:43.634
Uh, Gordie?

01:43.635 --> 01:45.836
Would you get me a few
gallons of milk, please?

01:45.837 --> 01:47.304
Oh. But I have
violin practice.

01:47.305 --> 01:50.876
Running my errands
comes before rock 'n' roll.

01:50.877 --> 01:53.577
So if you don't want to raise
your family in detention...

01:56.882 --> 01:59.116
So has anyone asked you to
the St. Patrick's Day dance yet?

01:59.117 --> 02:00.618
No. But between
you and me,

02:00.619 --> 02:01.953
there's someone
I wish would.

02:01.954 --> 02:03.955
Really? Let me guess.
Um...Jerry.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.089
No.
Pat?

02:05.090 --> 02:06.457
Sabrina, you aren't
gonna get it.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.360
Jimmy?
No. It's Gordie.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.095
Ken?

02:11.096 --> 02:13.531
Look, I've gotten to know him
since I started orchestra.

02:13.532 --> 02:15.032
He's sort of
the Kevin Costner

02:15.033 --> 02:16.234
of the string
section.

02:16.235 --> 02:18.235
Well, then, we have to get him
to ask you to the dance.

02:18.236 --> 02:19.971
Well, I've been dropping
serious hints,

02:19.972 --> 02:22.106
but he hasn't been
picking up on them.

02:22.107 --> 02:23.641
SABRINA:
Hey, Gordie.

02:23.642 --> 02:26.744
Hey, did you see that, uh,
St. Patrick's Day dance poster?

02:26.745 --> 02:28.679
You know,
Val loves to dance.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.582
In fact, she loves to
be <i>asked</i> to dance.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.018
Mr. Kraft needs milk.

02:37.523 --> 02:40.291
See? You can't
be subtle.

02:40.292 --> 02:42.393
A surprise party
is just the thing

02:42.394 --> 02:44.295
to make Salem forget
he's not a man.

02:44.296 --> 02:45.729
I hope his old address
book is in there.

02:45.730 --> 02:46.964
It won't be much
of a surprise

02:46.965 --> 02:48.098
if we're the only guests.
Hm.

02:55.073 --> 02:57.775
One dry cleaning receipt
for a velvet cape.

02:57.776 --> 03:00.311
And no address book.

03:00.312 --> 03:02.379
A scepter?

03:02.380 --> 03:03.714
This is sad.

03:03.715 --> 03:05.382
( sighs )
What a day.

03:05.383 --> 03:07.952
I was playing matchmaker
for Valerie and Gordie,

03:07.953 --> 03:10.187
which is like
the low-self-esteem Olympics.

03:10.188 --> 03:13.124
And Libby is politicking
for that known evil

03:13.125 --> 03:14.358
called Willard Kraft.

03:14.359 --> 03:16.594
And yet you're not
a cat.

03:19.297 --> 03:21.332
Did I mention
I almost choked on a dandy?

03:21.333 --> 03:23.167
( <i>magical theme playing</i> )

03:23.168 --> 03:25.803
Oh, a rainbow.
I hope that doesn't stain.

03:25.804 --> 03:29.174
Faith and begorra.
It's your lover-boy.

03:32.377 --> 03:34.011
Roland, what's with
the brogue?

03:34.012 --> 03:35.713
It's part of my new job.

03:35.714 --> 03:37.448
You know,
after a lot of therapy,

03:37.449 --> 03:40.017
I finally figured out
why you and I never clicked.

03:40.018 --> 03:41.586
Your personality?

03:41.587 --> 03:43.187
<i>No.</i> You're shallow.

03:43.188 --> 03:45.222
So I needed a glamorous
job to impress you.

03:45.223 --> 03:46.290
So...

03:46.291 --> 03:48.559
say hello to
your dream date,

03:48.560 --> 03:50.495
Leprechaun Roland.

03:52.297 --> 03:54.365
Erin go back.

03:54.366 --> 03:55.567
Look, Roland,
how can I put this

03:55.568 --> 03:57.201
without hurting
your feelings?

03:57.202 --> 03:58.602
You sicken me.

03:58.603 --> 04:01.272
Hey. Let's take it slow.

04:01.273 --> 04:03.474
We have the rest of our lives
to love each other.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.478
Hey, uh, you want to
give me a leg up here?

04:08.246 --> 04:10.347
Roland...
you're not helping.

04:10.348 --> 04:12.050
In fact, I think
you're enjoying this.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.551
Like you're not.
Ooh.

04:15.921 --> 04:16.887
Where are you going?

04:16.887 --> 04:19.423
I'll use the linen closet.

gold anymore.

Great. Well, I know
what my first one will be.

would go away.

But, honey--

05:40.805 --> 05:42.439
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

05:42.440 --> 05:44.975
I just tried on one of

and I almost suffocated
in the sleeve.

05:47.179 --> 05:48.212
Whoa!

05:48.213 --> 05:50.814
Are these wish coupons?
How many?

05:50.815 --> 05:52.349
Three. Well, two.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.818
I blew one ditching
Roland McLeprechaun.

05:54.819 --> 05:56.554
Sabrina, I'll be
your best friend

05:56.555 --> 05:58.723
if you use a wish
to turn me back into a man.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.257
Oh, please, please, please.
Salem,

06:00.258 --> 06:03.161
you know I can't use magic to
help you regain your human form.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.063
It's a direct violation
of the Witches' Council.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.598
One of Roland's coupons
wouldn't be your magic.

06:07.599 --> 06:10.701
If anyone found out, it'd be
his emerald keister in a sling.

06:10.702 --> 06:12.704
Right. But the last time
you were a man,

06:12.705 --> 06:13.904
you tried to take over
the world.

06:13.905 --> 06:15.806
No politics. Promise.

06:15.807 --> 06:19.577
I just wanna remember
what it's like to be human.

06:19.578 --> 06:20.978
Please.

06:20.979 --> 06:22.946
Well...

06:22.947 --> 06:24.148
Oh, please.

06:24.149 --> 06:26.617
Roland, I have a wish.

06:26.618 --> 06:29.386
Yes! Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

06:29.387 --> 06:32.323
So Salem will enter the body
of a student at school

06:32.324 --> 06:33.490
so I can keep
an eye on him.

06:33.491 --> 06:36.026
Preferably a young
Dan Blocker type.

06:36.027 --> 06:38.029
And I'll keep one wish
coupon to bring him back.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.196
No problem.

06:39.197 --> 06:41.132
Let's take Salem's essence
to school

06:41.133 --> 06:42.499
and find a suitable vessel.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.534
Do it.

06:43.535 --> 06:45.970
I wish Salem was human,

06:45.971 --> 06:47.605
with all the aforementioned
disclaimers.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.643
( moaning )

06:52.644 --> 06:56.246
Next time I lift my hat,
Salem enters the nearest body.

06:56.247 --> 06:58.249
But what about
the cat?

06:58.250 --> 07:02.286
Oh. He's just a regular
house cat till Salem returns.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.288
You're loving my new
cologne, aren't you?

07:07.092 --> 07:09.026
Oh, hello, Salem.

07:09.027 --> 07:10.461
Listen, we need a good...

07:10.462 --> 07:11.763
haberdasher.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.698
And since you know
so many people who...

07:13.699 --> 07:15.933
haberdash, would you
happen to know

07:15.934 --> 07:17.134
where your old
address book is?

07:17.135 --> 07:18.402
( meows )

07:18.403 --> 07:21.238
Did he meow?

07:21.239 --> 07:24.408
"Vote for
Mr. Kraft or else."

07:24.409 --> 07:25.909
I thought of that
slogan myself.

07:25.910 --> 07:29.012
Sir. My thumb is really
starting to throb.

07:29.013 --> 07:32.082
Oh, stop kissing up
and finish the job.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.819
Watch out. You might cover the
St. Patrick's Day <i>dance</i> poster.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.956
That poster.
Hey, Valerie?

07:37.957 --> 07:39.657
Yes?
If I use
the same tack holes,

07:39.658 --> 07:41.191
I might be able to avoid
thumb surgery.

07:43.061 --> 07:44.695
Let's pick a vessel
to put Salem in.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.296
Well, what's gonna
happen to the vessel?

07:46.297 --> 07:47.831
I mean, student?

07:47.832 --> 07:49.600
Once Salem's done
with the body,

07:49.601 --> 07:51.802
the kid will think he's been
home with the mumps. Duh.

07:51.803 --> 07:54.138
Okay. Well, let's take
our time and chose carefully.

07:54.139 --> 07:56.440
Okay. I pick
that guy.

07:56.441 --> 07:58.709
Gordie, are you aware
there's a dance on Friday?

07:58.710 --> 07:59.810
Roland, wait.

07:59.811 --> 08:02.212
Gee, Valerie, I--

08:03.682 --> 08:04.915
I'll pick you up
at 8.

08:04.916 --> 08:06.250
What kind of flowers
do you like?

08:06.251 --> 08:07.351
Surprise me.

08:07.352 --> 08:08.685
That means roses.

08:08.686 --> 08:09.620
( clicks tongue )

08:11.589 --> 08:13.224
Sabrina...

08:13.225 --> 08:15.859
I think Gordie
just hit puberty.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.194
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

08:21.033 --> 08:22.600
Salem?
Speaking.

08:22.601 --> 08:24.635
Man. Standing rocks.

08:24.636 --> 08:27.104
Well, uh, that was really nice
of you to ask Valerie out--

08:27.105 --> 08:28.539
Well, to get Gordie
to ask Val--

08:28.540 --> 08:30.174
Well, whatever just
happened was nice.

08:30.175 --> 08:32.308
Well, I thought I might be
of some service while I'm here.

08:32.309 --> 08:33.811
It's just my way of saying

08:33.812 --> 08:35.980
thank you, thank you,

08:35.981 --> 08:37.181
thank you.

08:37.182 --> 08:39.650
Do you think it's
obsessive-compulsive disorder?

08:39.650 --> 08:41.751
A party will bring him
back to normal.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.554
Thank goodness you found
that address book.

08:43.554 --> 08:46.090
Yeah. Who would've thought
it'd be next to the phone?

08:46.091 --> 08:49.326
I just wish we knew what kind
of soiree he would like.

08:49.327 --> 08:51.429
Let's drop some hints,
but be subtle.

08:51.430 --> 08:52.263
Of course.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.199
Salem, what kind of
parties do you like?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.067
I like luaus.
How about you, Zelda?

08:57.068 --> 08:59.336
I like parties
that are more subtle.

08:59.337 --> 09:00.838

09:02.441 --> 09:04.909
Either we've offended him,
or he heard the ice cream truck.

09:04.910 --> 09:05.976
Stop it.
Huh?

09:05.977 --> 09:07.244
Oh.

09:07.245 --> 09:09.046
And where are you
off to,

09:09.047 --> 09:10.615
enchantress of
third period?

09:10.616 --> 09:12.349
English.
Lucky English.

09:12.350 --> 09:15.019
( gasps )
I better check these books
for hidden explosives.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.587
Okay, well, I'll see you
later, Gordie.

09:16.588 --> 09:18.455
And don't forget
who you're supposed to be.

09:18.456 --> 09:20.457
Oh. Identity crisis.

09:20.458 --> 09:21.759
Pep talk.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.727
I'm sorry I got jealous
about that love letter.

09:23.728 --> 09:25.329
I know you had
nothing to do with it.

09:25.330 --> 09:26.764
I have no idea
how it got in there.

09:28.233 --> 09:30.434
Or got framed?
( students chattering )

09:30.435 --> 09:33.304
Hey. Do you think
that commotion's coming from

09:33.305 --> 09:34.738
where Valerie
and Gordie went to?

09:34.739 --> 09:37.474
Oh, don't worry.
I'll go check for myself.

09:37.475 --> 09:39.410
It's real silver.

09:39.411 --> 09:42.213
You know how often
you're gonna have to clean this?

09:45.450 --> 09:46.750
Salem! I mean, Gordie.

09:47.886 --> 09:49.754
Okay. Well, uh...

09:49.755 --> 09:52.222
"Have a good class"
to you too.

09:52.223 --> 09:53.824
What?
What'd I do?

09:53.825 --> 09:55.059
You were smooching.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.227
I thought you liked me
to cheer Valerie up.

09:57.228 --> 10:00.030
Not like that.
I stand corrected.

10:00.031 --> 10:02.199
So the weekend
in Vegas is a no-go?

10:02.200 --> 10:05.169
Look, just go to math
and be Gordie,

10:05.170 --> 10:06.771
or you go back to
the litter box.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.039
I'll be good...
cross my gawky,

10:09.040 --> 10:10.607
adolescent heart.

10:10.608 --> 10:11.509
Mm.

10:12.610 --> 10:15.913
Hm. High school
politics.

10:15.914 --> 10:19.249
What could be
more innocent?

10:20.719 --> 10:21.886
I've got it.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.355
Please don't say
fox-hunting party again.

10:24.356 --> 10:25.956
Let's cast a spell
and crash

10:25.957 --> 10:27.725
the best party
that Salem ever went to.

10:27.726 --> 10:30.527
Oh, that's great.
Then we can re-create it.

10:30.528 --> 10:32.697
<i>Hair of a dog,</i>
<i>a laugh that's hearty,</i>

10:32.698 --> 10:35.699
<i>take us to Salem's</i>
<i>favorite party.</i>

10:38.437 --> 10:40.705
Well, judging from
the debauchery...

10:40.706 --> 10:41.906
( girls laughing )

10:41.907 --> 10:44.174
...I'd say we're
in Ancient Rome.

10:44.175 --> 10:45.776
Either that or it's
Super Bowl week.

10:45.777 --> 10:48.512
( horns playing fanfare )

10:50.982 --> 10:52.182
Caligula?

10:52.183 --> 10:53.917
I've been called worse.

10:53.918 --> 10:55.185
( man
grunts )

10:55.186 --> 10:56.320
Romulus.
( claps twice )

10:56.321 --> 10:58.989
Fetch these vixens
some fig leaves.

10:58.990 --> 11:02.993
I'll teach them
the secret handshake.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.394
I've seen enough.

11:07.632 --> 11:08.632
How about
fox hunting?

11:09.667 --> 11:11.903
Is this seat taken?

11:11.904 --> 11:15.439
Yes. By someone I might be
caught dead talking to.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.507
( laughs )

11:16.508 --> 11:17.441
Cute kid.

11:17.442 --> 11:19.443
All right...

11:19.444 --> 11:22.146
the Kraft campaign needs some
proven techniques for winning.

11:22.147 --> 11:24.014
As if you'd know any.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.584
Who do you think stuffed
the ballots in Chicago

11:26.585 --> 11:27.952
that got Kennedy elected?

11:27.953 --> 11:31.521
A lot of dead people
voted that year...twice.

11:31.522 --> 11:33.757
( laughing )

11:33.758 --> 11:35.025
What?

11:35.026 --> 11:36.728
<i>Ix-nay</i> on the <i>orruption-cay,</i>
<i>capisce?</i>

11:37.996 --> 11:40.331
What is the big idea
of you sitting with Libby?

11:40.332 --> 11:42.266
Uh, had to.
Lab partners.

11:42.267 --> 11:43.301
We don't
like her, right?

11:43.302 --> 11:44.368
Right. Now go to
math.

11:44.369 --> 11:45.336
( groans )

11:46.371 --> 11:47.437
What was that
all about?

11:47.438 --> 11:49.874
Oh. You know, just
the usual pithy banter

11:49.875 --> 11:51.642
that peppers
our school hallways.

11:51.643 --> 11:53.877
You've been hanging out
with Gordie an awful lot lately.

11:53.878 --> 11:56.013
Harvey, we're talking
about Gordie here.

11:56.014 --> 11:57.915
The letter. Oh!

11:57.916 --> 11:59.216
I don't think
I'm out of line

11:59.217 --> 12:00.684
asking for
an explanation.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.085
And I have one.
It's just...

12:02.086 --> 12:04.455
I'm having a hard time
remembering one right now.

12:04.456 --> 12:07.024
Is there a problem
here, farm boy?

12:07.025 --> 12:08.792
'Cause I need to
talk to Sabrina.

12:08.793 --> 12:10.094
What is your cousin
doing here?

12:10.095 --> 12:12.563
Updating me on my uncle.
We'll be right back.

12:14.065 --> 12:15.933
So how's it going with Salem?

12:15.934 --> 12:18.269
He's fine. But I have a problem
with a jealous boyfriend

12:18.270 --> 12:19.403
and your stupid
love letter.

12:19.404 --> 12:20.871
Now, please go away.

12:20.872 --> 12:22.873
Not without a goodbye kiss.

12:22.874 --> 12:25.142
It's an Irish tradition.
( kissing )

12:25.143 --> 12:26.276
Go!

12:27.912 --> 12:29.780
Just how close
a cousin is he?

12:31.416 --> 12:33.417
Do you think we should
invite Mary Ann Mobley?

12:33.418 --> 12:36.453
Mm. She doesn't get
along well with Castro.

12:37.622 --> 12:40.190
Hey. Thanks for
drinking my soda.

12:40.191 --> 12:42.426
What are you talking about?
I've got my own right here.

12:42.427 --> 12:43.394
Hey.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.129
I'm just like Dr. Pepper.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.664
So misunderstood.

12:47.665 --> 12:50.067
Caligula,
now why on earth

12:50.068 --> 12:51.535
would you sneak
home with us?

12:53.104 --> 12:54.171
BOTH:
Ew.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.906
( <i>energetic theme playing</i> )

12:57.475 --> 12:58.642
What you
looking for?

12:58.643 --> 13:00.210
Uh, I've completely
lost track of Gordie.

13:00.211 --> 13:02.746
Yeah, me too. You know, he's
not the guy I thought he was.

13:02.747 --> 13:05.549
I'm pretty sure he tried
to play footsie with me in Band.

13:05.550 --> 13:06.817
I'll kill him!

13:06.818 --> 13:08.685
I'm not that upset.

13:08.686 --> 13:11.155
Gordie. Gordie!

13:11.156 --> 13:13.523
Okay. I'm not
imagining it.

13:13.524 --> 13:15.860
You're calling out
Gordie's name in the hall.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.528
Why are you
so interested in him?

13:17.529 --> 13:18.896
He owes me money?

13:18.897 --> 13:20.731
Oh. Would you check
the boys' room for me?

13:22.033 --> 13:24.334
Salem, help!
Call the cops!

13:24.335 --> 13:25.769
( meows )

13:25.770 --> 13:27.371
Or just sit there
and do nothing.

13:27.372 --> 13:29.239
( yelping )

13:29.240 --> 13:31.242
Gordie's not in
this bathroom either,

13:31.243 --> 13:33.177
but I did find
Mr. Congeniality.

13:33.178 --> 13:34.411
Hi, cutie.

13:34.412 --> 13:36.079
Hey. Have you
seen Salem?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.048
Last time I saw him
he was talking to some girl

13:38.049 --> 13:39.883
and an old guy in the cafeteria.

13:39.884 --> 13:42.086
Something about how to win
an election.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.554
Oh, no.
Politics.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.490
What did you
say to her?

13:46.491 --> 13:49.560
None of your milk-fed
business, <i>farm boy.</i>

13:50.929 --> 13:54.331
This may not be a family
I wanna marry into.

13:54.332 --> 13:57.201
We start by announcing that
Principal Larue has gout

13:57.202 --> 13:59.102
and a secret family.

13:59.103 --> 14:00.370
That's brilliant.

14:00.371 --> 14:02.606
Let the innuendo begin.

14:02.607 --> 14:04.775
With my know-how
and your hairline,

14:04.776 --> 14:06.777
we don't have to stop
at this petty school election.

14:06.778 --> 14:09.513
We could take over the world.

14:09.514 --> 14:11.949
( chuckling )
Did I say world?

14:11.950 --> 14:13.383
I meant state.

14:13.384 --> 14:16.687
Oh, your biped days
are over, cat.

14:16.688 --> 14:18.522
Roland.

14:18.523 --> 14:20.291
Roland!

14:20.292 --> 14:22.292
Oh, Mr. Leprechaun.

14:22.293 --> 14:25.896
Aha! So now
it's Mr. Leprechaun.

14:25.897 --> 14:27.698
Wait a minute.
Mr. Leprechaun?

14:27.699 --> 14:29.299
Maybe I put it in my locker.

14:30.969 --> 14:33.403
Okay, now I'm beginning
to get suspicious.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.906
Now I remember. I left
the coupon at home.

14:35.907 --> 14:37.908
Aha.

14:37.909 --> 14:39.476
Wait a minute. What coupon?

14:40.712 --> 14:41.779
( screaming )

14:41.780 --> 14:43.614
( <i>frantic theme playing</i> )

14:48.453 --> 14:51.588
Roland. Where are you?

14:51.589 --> 14:53.957
Ugh! Wish you would
get over here.

14:55.226 --> 14:56.893
Your wish is my command.

14:56.894 --> 14:58.695
Where's the coupon?

14:58.696 --> 14:59.896
It's gone.

14:59.897 --> 15:02.232
You wished for me to
come here, so here I am.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.568
What? You mean I blew my
last wish? What am I gonna do?

15:04.569 --> 15:05.802
( thunder crashes )

15:05.803 --> 15:07.604
Salem's not only
taking over the school,

15:07.605 --> 15:09.106
I think he skipped French.

15:09.107 --> 15:10.874
Now what?

15:10.875 --> 15:12.043
We're bounty
hunters, ma'am.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.477
We're here to catch
some lawbreakers.

15:13.478 --> 15:16.781
One black cat/boy,
one former emperor of Rome,

15:16.782 --> 15:18.949
a Hilda, a Zelda,
a Roland...

15:18.950 --> 15:20.617
And a Sabrina.

15:20.618 --> 15:21.885
Gotta go.
Get her.

15:21.886 --> 15:24.121
( <i>rock music playing</i> )

15:29.560 --> 15:31.495
( mouthing words )

15:56.754 --> 15:58.655
Right this way, and
no sudden moves.

15:58.656 --> 16:00.357
I still don't know
what I did wrong.

16:00.358 --> 16:02.726
You let Charlie Toga Party exit
his realm and his time period.

16:02.727 --> 16:05.328
Last time he got loose,
the '60s happened.

16:05.329 --> 16:07.964
ZELDA:
Get your hand off my leg.

16:07.965 --> 16:09.967
( <i>thunder crashes</i> )

16:11.769 --> 16:13.704
Oh, this is a great
legal atmosphere.

16:13.705 --> 16:15.238
Especially
the vomitorium.

16:15.239 --> 16:16.974
Sabrina, I can't
believe you thought

16:16.975 --> 16:18.776
you would get away
with changing Salem.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.277
Although it does
explain why

16:20.278 --> 16:21.778
I finally beat
the cat at Scrabble.

16:21.779 --> 16:23.146
( bangs gavel )
Silence!

16:23.147 --> 16:24.281
The trials begin.

16:25.650 --> 16:29.686
Now who smuggled this miscreant
into the Mortal Realm?

16:29.687 --> 16:31.488
We didn't.
He stowed away.

16:31.489 --> 16:33.290
Is this true?
Maybe.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.592
But, Your Honor,
speaking man to man,

16:35.593 --> 16:37.894
they wanted me.

16:37.895 --> 16:40.464
We find Hilda and Zelda
innocent,

16:40.465 --> 16:43.267
and Caligula is sentenced

16:43.268 --> 16:46.403
to another hundred years
of unbridled decadence

16:46.404 --> 16:48.705
and nonstop partying.

16:48.706 --> 16:51.274
Same old, same old.

16:51.275 --> 16:53.310
( bangs gavel )
Next case.

16:53.311 --> 16:56.146
Who turned Salem into a human?

16:56.147 --> 16:58.448
Technically,
Roland the leprechaun did.

16:58.449 --> 16:59.950
But I don't see
what the big deal is.

16:59.951 --> 17:01.952
I mean, I'm sure Salem's
just hanging around school.

17:01.953 --> 17:03.787
Really?

17:06.124 --> 17:07.992
<i>And so it is with</i>
<i>great pride</i>

17:07.992 --> 17:10.861
<i>that I announce my plans</i>
<i>to run for governor.</i>

17:10.862 --> 17:12.329
If a wrestler can do it,

17:12.329 --> 17:14.231
why not a vice principal? Huh?

17:14.232 --> 17:15.299
( crowd applauds )

17:15.300 --> 17:17.267
Thank you. Thank you.

17:17.268 --> 17:19.803
See? He is at school.

17:19.804 --> 17:21.805
And you say
this is Roland's fault.

17:21.806 --> 17:23.473
Right. Roland
granted the wishes,

17:23.473 --> 17:25.675
which I didn't ask for,
and I should've used on clothes,

17:25.676 --> 17:27.877
so isn't he responsible
for the results?

17:27.878 --> 17:29.780
Is that how you really see it?

17:29.781 --> 17:31.815
Yes.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.850
No.

17:33.851 --> 17:35.486
I'm responsible.

17:35.487 --> 17:36.920
I should have known better.

17:36.921 --> 17:39.289
I just-- I felt
so bad for Salem.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.990
All I ask is that
the court be lenient,

17:40.991 --> 17:43.093
and, if possible,
please let me skip the orgy.

17:43.094 --> 17:45.262
Sabrina, we find you guilty

17:45.263 --> 17:46.863
of releasing
a witch familiar,

17:46.864 --> 17:48.732
who is wreaking havoc
on the world.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.569
But since this is Rome,
let's do as the Romans do.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.270
Speak Latin?
No.

17:53.271 --> 17:54.805
Throw her to the lions.

17:54.806 --> 17:56.873
( gasps )

17:56.874 --> 17:58.308
Isn't that
a little harsh?

17:58.309 --> 18:00.610
Why? She gets to
take that peashooter.

18:00.611 --> 18:02.379
Well, it's
something.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.015
Remember, Sabrina,
lions can smell fear.

18:05.016 --> 18:08.151
Oh. So bravery will cover
the smell of my tender flesh?

18:08.152 --> 18:09.653
Before the carnage begins,

18:09.654 --> 18:13.156
ladies and gentlemen...
our national anthem.

18:13.157 --> 18:15.659
( playing "O Canada" )

18:15.660 --> 18:17.427
I hate it when Nero fiddles.

18:17.428 --> 18:19.796
The home team always loses.

18:21.466 --> 18:23.133
Hey. It's
Roland and Salem.

18:23.134 --> 18:24.801
Oh. Thank Zeus.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.838
I'm sorry I ducked out on you.

18:27.839 --> 18:30.273
But I had to talk
Charlie Power-monger here

18:30.274 --> 18:31.808
out of taking down Microsoft.

18:31.809 --> 18:33.944
I thought I could
resist power...

18:33.945 --> 18:36.079
( weeping )
but I'm weak.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.914
I didn't want to
hurt you, Sabrina.

18:37.915 --> 18:39.549
I just wanted to rule you.

18:42.187 --> 18:45.422
Your Honor,
I'm ready to be a cat again.

18:45.423 --> 18:48.625
Sabrina...once again
you've dodged the bullet.

18:48.626 --> 18:49.826
Heh.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.962
That's the name of the lion:

18:51.963 --> 18:52.796
Bullet.

18:52.797 --> 18:55.299
Thank you,
guys.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.399
If you'll
excuse me now,

18:56.400 --> 18:58.001
I think
I'm gonna faint.

18:58.002 --> 18:59.103
Oh.

18:59.104 --> 19:02.139
No. She does not need
mouth-to-mouth.

19:04.376 --> 19:07.277
( crying )
Another 50 years as a cat.

19:07.278 --> 19:09.346
By the time I work off
this extra time,

19:09.347 --> 19:10.648
I'll be
an old man.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.350
Oh. Many people are vital
in their later years.

19:13.351 --> 19:14.684
Look at John Glenn.

19:14.685 --> 19:15.852
You look at him.

19:15.853 --> 19:17.288
No, you really should
thank Roland

19:17.289 --> 19:18.889
for talking you
into turning yourself in.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.123
Oh, no thanks needed.

19:20.124 --> 19:22.393
I did it for love of
a good woman.

19:22.394 --> 19:23.727
Oh, so you met someone?

19:23.728 --> 19:26.263
You don't like
the leprechaun thing, do you?

19:26.264 --> 19:28.498
That's why I start
an exciting new job on Monday.

19:28.499 --> 19:31.168
Organ donor?
Bounty hunter.

19:31.169 --> 19:33.636
So let's just hope
next time we meet,

19:33.637 --> 19:36.173
it's not because there's a price
on your head, pretty lady.

19:37.842 --> 19:40.310
Well, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

19:40.311 --> 19:42.413
I'm sorry I made
you guys stand trial.

19:42.414 --> 19:44.314
I was just trying to
give Salem a nice present.

19:44.315 --> 19:45.815
Oh. Apology
accepted.

19:45.816 --> 19:49.052
We're proud that you took
responsibility for your actions.

19:49.053 --> 19:51.054
Now for the bad news.
Because of the time change

19:51.055 --> 19:53.423
from Ancient Rome, it's time
for you to go to school.

19:53.424 --> 19:55.125
What?

19:55.126 --> 19:57.361
The sleep I get in school
is never as good

19:57.362 --> 19:59.596
as the sleep
I get in a bed.

19:59.597 --> 20:01.031
I thought I already
had the mumps,

20:01.032 --> 20:02.199
but it sure does
explain a lot.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.634
Yeah, especially
the low voice

20:03.635 --> 20:05.102
and narcissistic
tendencies.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.804
I'm just glad you're
back to your old self.

20:07.805 --> 20:10.807
Okay, this is hard,
so I'm just gonna say it.

20:10.808 --> 20:13.577
Do you want to go
to the Slicery?

20:13.578 --> 20:14.744
Love to.

20:14.745 --> 20:15.845
Really?

20:15.846 --> 20:17.447
( sighs )

20:17.448 --> 20:20.117
I can't understand why you
took such a dive at the polls.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.519
Well, I blame that
carrot-top weasel, Gordie.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.455
Mother always said
that freckles

20:24.456 --> 20:26.256
are the devil's fresco.

20:26.257 --> 20:28.391
Hello,
Mr. Kraft.

20:28.392 --> 20:30.994
Here are your detention
slips, son.

20:30.995 --> 20:32.629
That ought to keep
you occupied

20:32.630 --> 20:34.031
through
grad school.

20:35.166 --> 20:36.266
Rain check?

20:37.768 --> 20:38.835
Hey.

20:38.836 --> 20:40.737
Harvey, listen,
I owe you an apology

20:40.738 --> 20:42.172
for being
so distracted recently.

20:42.173 --> 20:44.208
It's okay. It's
just nice to talk to you

20:44.209 --> 20:45.509
without hundreds
of other men

20:45.510 --> 20:46.643
vying for
your attention.

20:48.579 --> 20:50.847
Sabrina. I--

20:53.885 --> 20:55.952
Oh. You romantic, you.

20:55.953 --> 20:58.655
What? That's
my signature.

20:58.656 --> 21:00.590
It was you all along.

21:02.093 --> 21:04.027
Surprise.

21:04.028 --> 21:05.161
Think I need a nap.

21:05.162 --> 21:07.264
I recommend the desks
in Language Lab.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.471
Ooh. Have a nice
nap, Zelda.

21:14.472 --> 21:15.406
You too.

21:16.641 --> 21:17.941
Did we forget
something?

21:17.942 --> 21:20.544
Oh. They must be here
for Salem's party.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.012
( gasps )
Salem's party.

21:22.013 --> 21:23.847
Okay, don't panic.
Uh, turn on some music,

21:23.848 --> 21:25.615
I'll get some dip.
And the guest of honor.

21:31.355 --> 21:33.624
Oh, hello,
Mary Ann Mobley.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.426
And what is Castro
doing here?
