AS GREAT AS
THAT IDEA SOUNDS,

17:23.367 --> 17:25.467
I GOT A BETTER ONE.

17:27.033 --> 17:28.000
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE ALL SET.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.700
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST
PULL ON THIS ROPE,

17:29.700 --> 17:31.734
AND IT'S GONNA RAIN
BAKED BEANS

17:31.734 --> 17:34.800
ALL OVER THOSE SIGMAS.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.967
YES!

17:35.967 --> 17:36.667
NOW REMEMBER, WE DON'T
DO ANYTHING

17:36.667 --> 17:38.500
UNTIL EDDIE GIVES
THE SIGNAL.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.200
OK.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.200
WAIT, EDDIE, COME HERE.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.700
UM, WE DON'T HAVE A SIGNAL.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.033
OOH, HOW ABOUT--

17:46.033 --> 17:47.600
STOP IT.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.934
HOW ABOUT, UH...

17:49.934 --> 17:51.200
GENIUS, YES!

17:51.200 --> 17:52.300
RIGHT! RIGHT!

17:52.300 --> 17:53.667
LET ME DO
WHAT I DO.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.100
WHOO! WE ARE GONNA
GIVE THOSE SIGMAS

17:56.100 --> 17:57.767
A TASTE OF
THEIR OWN MEDICINE.

17:57.767 --> 17:58.834
YEAH...WAIT A MINUTE.

17:58.834 --> 18:01.033
I THOUGHT WE WERE
DROPPING THE BEANS.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.000
WELL, THOMAS,
THE BROTHERS HAVE MET,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.834
AND WE'VE COME
TO A DECISION.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.500
OH, HAVE YOU NOW?

18:10.500 --> 18:11.300
THAT'S RIGHT,

18:11.300 --> 18:12.667
BUT BEFORE
WE TELL YOU WHAT IT IS,

18:12.667 --> 18:15.300
WE HAVE SOMETHING
WE WANT TO SAY.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.100
WE KNOW YOU TRIED
TO SCAM US, THOMAS.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.100
ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE BEEN ON TO YOU,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.200
LADIES MAN.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.700
ALL RIGHT, CHELS,
JUST WAIT
FOR THE SIGNAL.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.734
SO YOU KNOW THAT
CHELSEA AND I
ARE JUST FRIENDS,

18:27.734 --> 18:28.867
AND RAVEN AS WELL.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.500
AND YOU STILL PUT ME
THROUGH THAT TORTURE,

18:30.500 --> 18:31.934
YOU KNOW,
JUST TO TELL ME

18:31.934 --> 18:34.500
THAT I'M NOT GETTING
INTO THE SIGMAS, RIGHT?

18:34.500 --> 18:37.500
NOW WHY WOULD WE
TELL YOU THAT?

18:37.500 --> 18:38.867
HUH?

18:38.867 --> 18:40.734
WELCOME TO THE SIGMAS!

18:40.734 --> 18:41.867
HEY!

18:41.867 --> 18:42.967
YEA YEA!

18:42.967 --> 18:44.400
YEA YEA!

18:44.400 --> 18:45.100
YO YO YO!

18:45.100 --> 18:46.300
BUT WHAT ABOUT
ALL THE LYING

18:46.300 --> 18:47.233
AND THE SCHEMING I DID?

18:47.233 --> 18:48.900
THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE
ABOUT YOU.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.600
YEAH, MAN.
WE ALL DID IT TO GET IN.

18:50.600 --> 18:54.600
ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS,
BROTHER THOMAS.

18:54.600 --> 18:55.667
YES!

18:55.667 --> 18:57.000
THAT'S THE SIGNAL!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.834
NO, CHELS!
THAT'S NOT THE SIGNAL.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.200
YOU ALMOST RUINED
EVERYTHING.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.800
NO!

19:02.800 --> 19:05.100
THAT'S THE SIGNAL.

19:17.967 --> 19:20.200
THIS IS BEANS!

19:20.200 --> 19:21.934
[RAVEN LAUGHS]

19:23.100 --> 19:24.767
WHAT? WHAT?

19:25.867 --> 19:26.467
WAIT A SECOND.

19:26.467 --> 19:29.834
WHO'S LOWER THAN A WORM'S
BELLY BUTTON NOW?

19:29.834 --> 19:31.467
YEA YEA.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.767
RAVEN?

19:33.767 --> 19:34.600
YEAH?

19:34.600 --> 19:35.400
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.800
BECAUSE YOU GAVE ME
THE SIGNAL.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.467
NO, NO, NO.
THAT WASN'T THE SIGNAL.

19:38.467 --> 19:39.667
THIS IS THE SIGNAL.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.300
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE,
ALL RIGHT.

19:41.300 --> 19:41.967
WE BEANED THEM.

19:41.967 --> 19:43.567
THE DIFFERENCE IS
YOUR VISION WAS WRONG.

19:43.567 --> 19:45.233
THEY WERE GONNA
LET ME IN.

19:45.233 --> 19:46.233
[GASPS]

19:46.233 --> 19:47.300
REALLY?

19:47.300 --> 19:49.567
[GASPS] YES!

19:49.567 --> 19:51.233
MY BAD.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.867
THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
MY SIGMA BROTHER.

19:53.867 --> 19:55.400
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA
LAUGH AT THIS

19:55.400 --> 19:57.133
AT OUR NEXT
SIGMA PARTY.

19:57.133 --> 19:58.400
YEA YEA!

19:58.400 --> 20:00.667
WRONG, OK?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE THOUGHT
HE WAS SIGMA MATERIAL.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.033
MAN, YOU JUST--

20:04.033 --> 20:05.700
HOLD UP, NOW.
HOLD UP, HOMEY.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.200
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.700
JUST BECAUSE EDDIE IS NOT

20:08.700 --> 20:10.033
TALL, DARK,
HANDSOME, MUSCULAR--

20:10.033 --> 20:13.400
HEY, YOU BETTER BE
GOING SOMEWHERE
WITH THIS.

20:14.767 --> 20:16.600
EDDIE'S A GREAT GUY,
AND IT'S YOUR LOSS.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.700
YEAH, YEAH, AND EDDIE
WOULDN'T JOIN
YOUR STUPID SIGMAS

20:20.700 --> 20:21.767
EVEN IF YOU
BEGGED HIM TO.

20:21.767 --> 20:24.200
YOU AIN'T GOT
TO BEG ME IF YOU
WANT TO JUST ASK...

20:24.200 --> 20:24.967
LET'S GO, FELLAS.

20:24.967 --> 20:26.567
I AIN'T GONNA SAY
NOTHING MUCH MORE
THAN THAT.

20:26.567 --> 20:27.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:27.400 --> 20:28.767
'CAUSE WE CAN GET DOWN
AND DO WHAT WE DO,

20:28.767 --> 20:30.000
AS LONG AS Y'ALL--
WHERE Y'ALL GOING?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.033
WHERE Y'ALL GOING?
Y'ALL AIN'T GOT TO
GO NOWHERE.

20:32.033 --> 20:35.033
I MEAN, OK, I SEE,
Y'ALL GONNA GET BACK
WITH A BROTHER.

20:35.033 --> 20:37.133
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE BEANS.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.133
EDDIE, EDDIE,
IT'S OVER. COME ON.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.600
COME ON, NOW,
EDDIE. IT'S OVER.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.200
IT'S OVER, OK?

20:42.200 --> 20:44.934
I'M SORRY THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT

20:44.934 --> 20:46.300
THE WAY YOU
WANTED THEM TO.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.100
DON'T BE SORRY, RAE.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.100
I MEAN,
I'M PROUD OF MYSELF.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.500
I TOOK EVERYTHING
THEY DISHED OUT AT ME,

20:50.500 --> 20:52.834
AND I STILL LEARNED
SOMETHING FROM
ALL OF THIS.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.834
OH, SEE, THAT'S RIGHT.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.033
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT

20:55.033 --> 20:56.667
THAN TWO GOOD FRIENDS
WHO CARE ABOUT YOU.

20:56.667 --> 20:57.400
YEAH, THERE'S THAT,

20:57.400 --> 20:58.600
AND THEN NEXT TIME
WE HAVE A PLAN,

20:58.600 --> 21:00.400
WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH A BETTER SIGNAL.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.700
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SAID TO DO THIS.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.967
WHICH IS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT FROM THIS.

21:04.967 --> 21:05.934
YOU GUYS,
I'M TELLING YOU,

21:05.934 --> 21:07.300
WE JUST SHOULD'VE
DONE THIS.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.667
STOP IT!
STOP IT!

21:08.667 --> 21:10.100
OK.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.133
YO, THAT WAS
A FUN WEEKEND, RIGHT, GUYS?

21:17.133 --> 21:18.100
YEAH, CHELS,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.500
THOSE JELLY BEANS
REALLY SPICED THINGS UP.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.600
TOLD YOU.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.867
UH, EDDIE, YOU'RE NOT
STILL BUMMED OUT

21:23.867 --> 21:26.467
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET INTO
THE SIGMAS, ARE YOU?

21:26.467 --> 21:27.133
OH, NO, RAE.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.767
I MEAN, I KNOW I GOT
CAUGHT UP INTO IT

21:28.767 --> 21:29.500
FOR A WHOLE LITTLE BIT,

21:29.500 --> 21:31.233
BUT, I MEAN, AFTER I
THOUGHT ABOUT IT, I REALIZED,

21:31.233 --> 21:33.367
IF I HAVE TO LIE AND CHEAT
TO GET INTO A GROUP,

21:33.367 --> 21:35.600
IT'S NOT THE GROUP
THAT I WANT TO BE IN.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.233
YOU KNOW WHAT, EDDIE,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:37.233 --> 21:40.767
BESIDES, I MEAN,
AFTER THAT MESS WE MADE
IN THE CAFETERIA,

21:40.767 --> 21:43.700
WE GOT ACCEPTED INTO
A WHOLE OTHER CLUB.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.500
YEAH.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.467
