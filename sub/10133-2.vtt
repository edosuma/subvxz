[girls giggling]

08:36.475 --> 08:38.935
Well...I guess we gotta go.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.396
I might go back

08:38.977 --> 08:41.396
to the sixth grade.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.273
Stephanie really needs me.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.657
I play golf, too.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.327
No, Michelle,

08:52.699 --> 08:55.327
you sit right here

08:55.369 --> 08:57.954
and watch Uncle Jesse

08:55.369 --> 08:57.954
get a golf lesson first.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.998
Okay, babe?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.416
Got it, dude.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.341
[laughing]

09:10.884 --> 09:13.636
[laughing]

09:13.678 --> 09:14.846
Thanks for the clothes.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.930
If the sun goes down,

09:14.888 --> 09:15.930
we could play

09:15.972 --> 09:18.641
by the light on my<i> pants.</i>

09:18.683 --> 09:20.810
Hey, we're doing this

09:18.683 --> 09:20.810
to impress the client.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.646
How, by burning out his retinas?

09:23.688 --> 09:26.233
Get your mind off your pants.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.233
Watch my swing.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.650
Right.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.113
That's it?

09:30.028 --> 09:32.113
That's the whole thing?

09:32.155 --> 09:34.115
Piece of cake!

09:34.157 --> 09:36.159
Watch the kid take care

09:34.157 --> 09:36.159
of business here.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.702
[clears throat]

09:41.664 --> 09:44.876
[humming]

09:44.918 --> 09:46.378
Jess?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.880
Elvis never made

09:46.420 --> 09:48.880
<i>one</i> golf movie.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.300
- Alright, here we go.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.300
- Let's go.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.930
Uh-oh!

09:56.971 --> 09:58.139
Yeah, that was great.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.933
You see, uh, very few golfers

09:59.974 --> 10:02.436
can drive a lawn that far.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.728
Here, come on,

10:02.477 --> 10:03.728
I'll help you out.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.189
- Alright, give me a hand.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.189
- Okay.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.732
[clears throat]

10:10.902 --> 10:13.613
I hope this is golf-related.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.823
If it wasn't,

10:13.654 --> 10:15.823
would I be doing it?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.287
- Alright, here we go.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.287
- Here we go.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.163
- Ball off your left heel.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.831
Remember, always keep

10:22.205 --> 10:23.831
your head down.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.459
Always keep

10:23.873 --> 10:25.459
the head down. Good.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.751
- Bend your knees.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.751
- Bend the knees.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.128
- Keep your head down.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.128
- Head down.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.754
- Right elbow in.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.005
- Head down.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.005
- Sorry.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.882
Now, bring the club back slowly.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.801
Club back slowly.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.011
Oh, sorry. Head down.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.014
- Whack and follow through.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.641
You're ready to try one

10:40.056 --> 10:41.641
for yourself?

10:41.682 --> 10:45.604
No, I wanna play like this

10:41.682 --> 10:45.604
for 18 holes. Get off!

10:45.645 --> 10:48.106
Get you something to hit.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.108
- Nice, easy target.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.108
- Easy target.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.028
Here we go.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.114
[Jesse sniffles]

10:59.326 --> 11:00.952
Daddy'd be mad.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.581
Not if Michelle be quiet.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.626
My turn.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.884
I'm good.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.644
See how she kept her head down?

11:25.684 --> 11:26.978
Shut up!

11:29.022 --> 11:32.108
[indistinct chatter]

11:32.150 --> 11:33.818
Over here! I saved you a seat.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.157
- Thanks. My name's--

11:36.988 --> 11:39.157
- Not you, scrub.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.825
The seat's taken.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.079
Oh, here comes Mrs. Agbabian.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.581
Good way to lose your lunch.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.125
[laughs]

11:49.167 --> 11:52.170
Young lady,

11:49.167 --> 11:52.170
keep the aisle clear.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.256
[whistles]

11:55.298 --> 11:57.676
That will be enough of that!

11:57.716 --> 12:00.053
Now, find a seat.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.013
That's a<i> very</i> snappy outfit.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.140
[all laughing]

12:08.228 --> 12:10.063
(female #1)

12:08.228 --> 12:10.063
'Cute outfit.'

12:11.690 --> 12:13.149
[all laughing]

12:23.201 --> 12:25.078
Hi, how's it going?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.581
(woman on phone)

12:25.119 --> 12:27.581
'At the tone,

12:25.119 --> 12:27.581
Pacific Daylight Time'

12:27.622 --> 12:31.750
'will be...12:14, exactly.'

12:31.792 --> 12:33.545
[beep]

12:33.587 --> 12:35.630
'At the tone,

12:33.587 --> 12:35.630
Pacific Daylight Time..'

12:39.175 --> 12:41.760
[sighs]

12:39.175 --> 12:41.760
My beautiful lawn..

12:41.802 --> 12:43.722
...hacked into pieces.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.600
Another senseless act

12:43.762 --> 12:46.600
of backyard violence.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.476
Gopher!

12:48.518 --> 12:50.895
A gopher did this?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.439
[laughing]

12:52.480 --> 12:53.690
- Hello!

12:52.480 --> 12:53.690
- Hi.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.567
Two gopher.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.693
Oh, you mean, two<i> golfers?</i>

12:56.735 --> 12:59.862
No, one golfer, one gopher.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.239
[laughs]

13:01.281 --> 13:04.534
You were, uh, hitting golf balls

13:01.281 --> 13:04.534
in my back yard?

13:04.576 --> 13:07.704
I swear, I didn't hit one ball.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.414
Took us six hours just

13:07.746 --> 13:09.414
to play nine holes.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.998
Tell him your score, Jess.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.251
I got us the motor oil account.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.251
The client loved my ideas.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.420
- Oh, that's great, Jess.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.420
- Thank you.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.756
Tell him your score, Jess.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.674
- I shot a hundred.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.674
- Jess?

13:19.716 --> 13:22.260
And 50.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.512
- Jess?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.512
- Nine. You happy?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.014
Actually, I'm very sorry.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.058
Sorry that I don't have it

13:27.056 --> 13:29.058
on videotape!

13:29.100 --> 13:30.268
[laughs]

13:30.310 --> 13:31.645
- Hi, Deej.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.645
- Hi, guys.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.812
Hey, how was your first day

13:31.686 --> 13:33.812
of school?

13:33.854 --> 13:35.649
Oh, it was your

13:33.854 --> 13:35.649
typical first day.

13:35.690 --> 13:39.860
I got my classes, I went

13:35.690 --> 13:39.860
to 'em, and now I'm home.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.820
Oh, dad, would you mind tomorrow

13:41.862 --> 13:44.532
if I dressed a little more

13:41.862 --> 13:44.532
junior highish?

13:44.574 --> 13:46.660
Oh, no. Hey, I understand.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.120
You wanna be hip,

13:46.701 --> 13:49.120
like your rad dad.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.374
Yeah, that's it.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.374
Thanks, Dad, you're the best.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.044
Second grade is so cool!

13:57.086 --> 14:00.298
- Hey, great! What happened?

13:57.086 --> 14:00.298
- Everything!

14:00.340 --> 14:01.633
You<i> happen</i> to be looking

14:01.675 --> 14:04.927
at the Room Seven

14:01.675 --> 14:04.927
<i>official</i> fish feeder!

14:04.969 --> 14:06.805
(all)

14:04.969 --> 14:06.805
Whoo-hoo!

14:06.845 --> 14:08.931
- And Uncle Jesse?

14:06.845 --> 14:08.931
- 'What?'

14:08.973 --> 14:11.476
Now that D.J.'s finally gone

14:11.518 --> 14:12.935
when people say,

14:11.518 --> 14:12.935
"Hey, Tanner".

14:12.977 --> 14:14.729
I<i> know</i> they're talking to<i> me.</i>

14:14.771 --> 14:16.897
- Alright, kid.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.897
- 'Way to go.'

14:16.939 --> 14:20.067
And daddy, you'll love this.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.445
One of the shrimpy little

14:20.109 --> 14:22.445
first-graders asked me

14:22.487 --> 14:24.030
"Where's the cafeteria?"

14:24.071 --> 14:25.072
I said

14:25.114 --> 14:26.491
"Can't you read that big sign

14:26.533 --> 14:27.826
that says, cafeteria?"

14:27.867 --> 14:30.662
And the kid says,

14:27.867 --> 14:30.662
"No, I can't read."

14:30.704 --> 14:33.707
They can't even read!

14:33.748 --> 14:36.250
What a great day!

14:48.388 --> 14:50.223
(both)

14:48.388 --> 14:50.223
Ew!

14:53.100 --> 14:54.310
Hmm..

14:54.352 --> 14:56.312
Well, it's almost time

14:54.352 --> 14:56.312
for school.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.022
Do you think

14:56.354 --> 14:58.022
we look old enough?

14:58.064 --> 14:59.691
How old do we wanna look?

14:59.733 --> 15:03.152
Old enough to keep me out of

14:59.733 --> 15:03.152
that phone booth during lunch.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.112
At least<i> you</i> got to eat.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.157
I had to give<i> my</i> lunch

15:05.154 --> 15:08.157
to a girl with a tattoo.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.661
We could use

15:09.701 --> 15:11.661
a little more mascara.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.037
Yeah.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.040
Assume the position.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.504
Alright, a makeup party.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.924
I wanna look

15:21.546 --> 15:24.924
just like Superstar Barbie.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.761
Chill, child.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.761
You are way too young.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.096
I want makeup.

15:30.137 --> 15:33.474
Here, Michelle, you can put on

15:30.137 --> 15:33.474
a little lipstick.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.102
And I'm too young?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.272
How rude!

15:39.313 --> 15:41.649
(Danny)

15:39.313 --> 15:41.649
'Let's go, girls.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.649
It's getting late.'

15:41.691 --> 15:44.819
Uh, we're coming, Dad!

15:44.861 --> 15:46.571
Well..

15:46.613 --> 15:48.489
...how do we look?

15:51.242 --> 15:52.702
Cheap.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.873
Alright!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.626
- Kimmy!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.626
- Wait.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.469
- Kimmy?

16:05.965 --> 16:09.469
- Call me Kimberly.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.392
Joseph...it's finally happened.

16:16.434 --> 16:19.353
He's cleaning liquid soap.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.816
Don't be silly. I'm just

16:19.395 --> 16:22.816
cleaning my rubber gloves.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.192
Danny, there's no shame

16:22.857 --> 16:25.192
in therapy.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.821
Bye, see you later.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.363
- Bye, guys.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.363
- See you.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.866
- You should--

16:29.405 --> 16:31.866
- Wait a minute.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.160
Hold it right there.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.789
Dad, we have to get to school.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.458
You have to get past me first.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.169
You said I could look

16:40.500 --> 16:43.169
a little more junior highish.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.630
Where is this junior high?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.630
Caesars Palace?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.716
You may go to school.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.385
I guess, we're not as old

16:48.758 --> 16:51.385
as we thought we were.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.846
Are we, now?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.393
I'll see you at school, Deej.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.895
So long, boys.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.274
Dad, before you say anything

17:05.316 --> 17:06.609
you were not at school yesterday

17:06.651 --> 17:09.236
and you<i> did not</i> see

17:06.651 --> 17:09.236
the other girls.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.072
D.J., I don't care

17:09.278 --> 17:12.072
about the other girls.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
My daughter

17:12.114 --> 17:13.658
is not going to school

17:13.700 --> 17:16.661
dressed like Jessica Rabbit.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.539
Uncle Jesse, Joey,

17:16.703 --> 17:19.539
you're from this century.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.332
Tell him he's wrong.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.754
Fine, I'll go tie some bows

17:24.293 --> 17:26.754
in my hair

17:26.796 --> 17:27.881
put on my Garanimals

17:27.922 --> 17:29.966
and go skipping off

17:27.922 --> 17:29.966
to school!

17:30.008 --> 17:32.886
I'll be daddy's little girl

17:30.008 --> 17:32.886
forever.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.303
Not forever!

17:34.345 --> 17:37.181
Just until you're<i> my</i> age!

17:37.223 --> 17:38.975
Alright, boys. Let's go take

17:37.223 --> 17:38.975
care of business.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.309
We'll get her through this.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.979
- Come on.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.979
- Hold it.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.480
Do we have any idea how

17:43.021 --> 17:44.480
to get her through this?

17:44.522 --> 17:47.400
- Not a clue, no.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.400
- I'm not even in the ballpark.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.442
Oh, man!

17:48.484 --> 17:50.444
You know what all this means?

17:50.486 --> 17:53.781
We are on the verge

17:50.486 --> 17:53.781
of raising a teenager.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.116
Phew! She's gonna be

17:53.823 --> 17:56.116
going to wild parties.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.327
She's gonna be drivin' a car.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.705
She's gonna be dating guys.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.041
Like me!

18:03.082 --> 18:05.167
She's never leaving

18:03.082 --> 18:05.167

18:10.965 --> 18:14.010

18:14.052 --> 18:17.680
I can't. I'm your dad.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.680
It's my job.

18:17.722 --> 18:18.932
Honey..

18:18.973 --> 18:21.059
...I wanna know

18:18.973 --> 18:21.059
what's going on with you.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.147
Yesterday was

18:24.437 --> 18:27.147
the worst day of my life.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.779
Everyone looked

18:29.483 --> 18:32.779
so much older than me.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.824
I was dressed exactly like the

18:32.820 --> 18:36.824
teacher that everybody hates.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.701
I ate lunch

18:36.866 --> 18:38.701
in the phone booth listening

18:38.743 --> 18:41.996
to the time lady

18:38.743 --> 18:41.996
for 25 minutes and 30 seconds.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.748

[dramatic music]

18:46.918 --> 18:48.795
[sighs]

18:48.836 --> 18:51.255
I wish you would've

18:48.836 --> 18:51.255
told me this yesterday.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.091
I was too embarrassed.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.052
I don't know what happened.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.387
In the sixth grade, I was cool.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.139
And now I'm a joke.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.351
Oh, I know it feels that way.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.438
But that's just 'cause you were

19:04.393 --> 19:07.438
a big fish in a small pond.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.567
Now you're in a big pond,

19:07.480 --> 19:11.567
so you feel like a small fish.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.444
But you don't have

19:11.609 --> 19:13.444
to look like the big fish.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.613
Especially if the big fish

19:13.486 --> 19:15.613
are bad fish

19:15.655 --> 19:17.490
and smelly fish.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.034
And, well, now I'm lost

19:17.531 --> 19:20.034
and I'm rambling

19:20.076 --> 19:22.620
and I just wanna hug you

19:20.076 --> 19:22.620
and take you to SeaWorld.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.084
I just want people to like me.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.253
They will, as soon as

19:28.126 --> 19:31.253
they get to know you.

19:32.630 --> 19:36.300
But, look, D.J...

19:36.342 --> 19:38.427
...this girl isn't you.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.972
Then who am I?

19:41.014 --> 19:44.558
Well, I guess, to me,

19:41.014 --> 19:44.558
you're still my little girl.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.393
Honey, I don't wanna stop you

19:44.600 --> 19:46.393
from growing up.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.023
But you just can't go

19:46.435 --> 19:50.023
from 12 to 25 overnight.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.066

19:54.318 --> 19:56.863
You gotta realize

19:54.318 --> 19:56.863
that this teenage stuff

19:56.904 --> 19:59.323
is all new for both of us!

19:59.365 --> 20:01.701
But, honey,

19:59.365 --> 20:01.701
we can work it out..

20:01.742 --> 20:03.870
...if we keep one thing in mind.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.373
We have no choice.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.417
Danny, let's go.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.417
We're gonna be late.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.546
Oh, D.J., don't ever let

20:10.459 --> 20:13.546
your father do your makeup.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.925
I did it.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.925
It looked better before.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.677
You know, when I first started

20:17.967 --> 20:19.677
wearing makeup

20:19.719 --> 20:21.303
I made the same mistakes.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.264
Really? How old were you,

20:21.345 --> 20:24.264
18, 19?

20:24.306 --> 20:27.060
No, actually, I was right

20:24.306 --> 20:27.060
around D.J.'s age.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.562
Glad I asked.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.981
Really? You wore makeup

20:29.603 --> 20:31.981
when you were my age?

20:32.023 --> 20:33.858
Uh-huh...only my mom taught me

20:33.900 --> 20:35.526
that the secret

20:33.900 --> 20:35.526
to wearing makeup

20:35.568 --> 20:37.820
is to make it look like

20:35.568 --> 20:37.820
you're not wearing any.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.405
Well, how do you do that?

20:39.446 --> 20:41.741
Yeah, how do you do that?

20:41.782 --> 20:44.451
Well, by bringing out

20:41.782 --> 20:44.451
D.J.'s natural beauty.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.664
For instance, you want

20:44.493 --> 20:48.664
a very subtle pink eye shadow.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.167
- Can I show her?

20:48.706 --> 20:51.167
- Can she?

20:52.543 --> 20:54.253
Go for it.

20:54.294 --> 20:55.295
Thanks, Dad.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.672
And don't worry

20:56.714 --> 20:58.174
no matter how old I get

20:58.216 --> 21:00.509
you can always think of me

20:58.216 --> 21:00.509
as your little girl.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.345
Give me a hug, dad!

21:03.387 --> 21:05.848
Oh, I love those words.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.558
I love you.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.935

21:11.478 --> 21:15.399

21:18.527 --> 21:20.988

21:18.527 --> 21:20.988

21:37.171 --> 21:38.547

21:38.589 --> 21:41.175
- We have the same lunch now.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.175
- Alright! Now..

21:41.217 --> 21:42.802
What happened to your bod?

21:42.843 --> 21:45.471
It's back in my sock drawer.

21:45.512 --> 21:46.722
My mom saw me getting

21:45.512 --> 21:46.722
on the bus

21:46.764 --> 21:48.266
and she freaked out.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.726
