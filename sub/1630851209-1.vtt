WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:04.004
(cawing)

00:04.037 --> 00:07.541
It is a dark time
in Staten Island.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.611
A lot of vampires
have been slaughtered.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.146
(grunting, screaming)

00:14.548 --> 00:16.450
Not us, thankfully.
We're fine.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.018
But are we?

00:18.051 --> 00:20.020
I don't think we are.
(short chuckle)

00:20.053 --> 00:21.188
NANDOR:
The worst part

00:21.221 --> 00:22.556
is that it was our familiar

00:22.589 --> 00:24.258
that did the slaughtering.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.360
The worst part is
it was Nandor's

00:26.393 --> 00:28.195
own familiar
that did the slaughtering.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.030
It was Nandor's employee.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.065
Really Nandor's responsibility.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.400
‐Yep.
‐Talk to Nandor.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.302
It is true that Guillermo‐‐

00:35.335 --> 00:38.505
the familiar that all of us
share command of

00:38.539 --> 00:42.109
and responsibility for‐‐ is the
one that did the slaughtering.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.278
‐Aah!
‐NANDOR: But he did it

00:44.311 --> 00:47.481
to save our lives
from the Vampiric Council.

00:47.514 --> 00:51.318
Still, he should not have
done so much slaughtering.

00:51.351 --> 00:54.588
I frankly couldn't give
a cat's knuckle about Gizmo.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.424
I mean, he's just kind
of this fluttering lickspittle

00:57.457 --> 01:01.295
that is always bouncing about,
always behind Nandor.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.763
‐But Nandor likes him.
‐LASZLO: Oh, shut up,
Colin Robinson.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.431
‐You're giving me the pip.
‐Yes.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.233
And we are
running out of time here.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.236
Well, I guess I should
just shut the fuck up then.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.637
If you insist.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.105
NADJA:
I'm not objecting.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.407
You know, we know
what we have to do.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.675
We have to put
Guillermo to death

01:14.708 --> 01:16.410
before he puts
all of us to death.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.312
‐But he saved our lives.
‐NADJA: Okay, so we're saying,

01:18.345 --> 01:20.080
"Thank you for saving us,
but sorry,

01:20.113 --> 01:21.715
you're our mortal enemy‐‐
you got to die, babes."

01:21.748 --> 01:24.151
But we are still
in imminent danger.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.420
May I remind you all
that we were sentenced

01:26.453 --> 01:29.289
to death by the Vampiric Council
for killing vampires.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.725
‐Which he did.
‐And then more vampires
were killed.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.428
‐By him.
‐Which means they're gonna
send more assassins

01:34.461 --> 01:37.664
over here to get us.
And perhaps our familiar...

01:37.698 --> 01:39.600
‐Your familiar, dickhead.
‐You hired him,
you bloody plonker.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.402
...is the only one
that can protect us.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.338
But how do you know
he's not going to kill us?

01:44.371 --> 01:46.573
‐It is in his bloods.
‐COLIN: Ah, yes.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.343
Francis Galton's
perennial conundrum:

01:49.376 --> 01:51.612
‐nature versus nurture...
‐LASZLO: Shut the fuck up.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.580
‐Speak quiet, Colin Robinson.
‐Stop it, Colin Robinson.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.315
DOLL NADJA:
Everybody relax.
I have given this

01:55.349 --> 01:56.717
a lot of thought,
and my vote is...

01:56.750 --> 01:58.485
‐You don't get a vote.
‐Hey!

01:58.519 --> 02:00.087
‐Why not?
‐Because you are basically

02:00.120 --> 02:01.388
just another version of Nadja,

02:01.421 --> 02:03.090
and so your vote would be
the same as hers,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.458
‐which is not fair.
‐BOTH: You don't know that.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.426
‐Just because...
‐Oh, sorry, you go.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.761
‐No, you go.
‐No, you go.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.096
‐Okay, I'll go.
‐Okay, fine.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.531
What would your vote be?

02:10.564 --> 02:11.632
Death.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.600
What a brilliant point she has.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.502
I think we should
slumber on this.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.205
We do not have time to slumber!
The Vampiric Council is probably

02:18.238 --> 02:21.008
‐out there now searching for us
and him as we speak.
‐(bell ringing)

02:21.041 --> 02:23.310
Silence!
And hark.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.312
That was him.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.214
What could he want?

02:27.247 --> 02:29.416
Perhaps he is warning us
of an imminent danger.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.352
Or maybe his poop bucket's full.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.087
‐We must check.
‐I hope it's the poop bucket.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.089
Oh, and while
you're down there...

02:36.123 --> 02:38.091
kill him.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.271
Really?
Gosh, it feels like Saturday.

It's just, like,
"Where did my weekend go?"

03:26.273 --> 03:28.141
(laughing):
Am I right?

03:28.175 --> 03:30.110
NANDOR:
This is why I said
we should have a checklist

03:30.143 --> 03:31.612
of when he was fed
and who fed him.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.480
(speaking foreign language)

03:33.514 --> 03:35.616
How long has he been down here?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.584
Almost a month.
29 days.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.287
A month, and you've
not decided his fate yet?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.055
Well, I have certainly
been trying to.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.557
A decision like that,
there's a lot of moving parts.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.292
Got it.

03:45.325 --> 03:48.262
Now remember, do not look him
directly in the eyes.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.597
We still do not know
the depths of his power.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.299
I never looked him in the eyes
anyway, so I'm certainly

03:52.332 --> 03:54.234
not gonna start now.
Get the door open.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.669
Stand aside.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.244
‐Hi.
‐Guillermo,
why did you summon us?

04:04.278 --> 04:07.014
‐Is there a threat
of imminent danger?
‐No.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.583
‐Stand back! He's lunging at us!
‐NADJA: Oh!
‐Not that I know of.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.553
‐My bathroom bucket's full,
needs to be emptied.
‐NANDOR: Eesh.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.389
‐Okay. Maybe one
of you big, strong men...
‐I'll do it. I'll do it.

04:15.422 --> 04:19.159
I‐I think it's important
that I sift through the scat

04:19.193 --> 04:21.762
to see if he's sending out
any secret messages.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.230
‐LASZLO: Scat away.
‐NANDOR: Good thinking.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.465
NADJA:
Um, so, here are your foods.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.667
‐(short chuckle)
‐Thank you, Nadja.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.137
‐You can just hand it to me.
I'm not...
‐Stay.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.539
‐...not gonna hurt you.
‐NANDOR: Nice job.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.175
Yay, more raw chicken.

04:35.209 --> 04:38.111
The prisoner will
slide his bucket of shame

04:38.145 --> 04:40.547
over to the sally port.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.083
And the prisoner
will be reminded

04:43.116 --> 04:45.085
not to make
any sudden movements,

04:45.118 --> 04:48.288
‐lest he get the prod.
‐I have a name.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.357
Just slide your shit bucket
over to sally's port.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.426
Thank you.

GUILLERMO:
This is ridiculous.
Can't you just let me out?

05:01.368 --> 05:04.204
‐You know I wouldn't hurt you.
‐LASZLO: Bullshit.
Please remember

05:04.238 --> 05:06.540
that this man
is a vampire killer.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.142
I was protecting you!
I saved your lives!

05:09.176 --> 05:11.478
Yes, and we have taken that
into consideration.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.381
But we are still
in discussions about

05:14.414 --> 05:16.250
what your fate is going to be.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.685
Oh, okay. And may I ask
how far along you are

05:18.719 --> 05:21.555
‐in these discussions?
Or is it one of those things
‐LASZLO: No.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.323
where you just linger
and argue with each other

05:23.357 --> 05:24.658
'cause you don't have
a Guillermo next to you

05:24.691 --> 05:26.527
to solve all of your problems?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.295
‐This fucking guy.
‐Insolent!
‐You need to prod him.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.265
Hey, hey, hey!
The prisoner will be reminded

05:31.298 --> 05:34.501
to treat his captors
with respect

05:34.535 --> 05:36.370
‐and kindness.
‐Yes.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.405
‐Or he'll taste
the wrath of my...
‐NANDOR: Do it.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.707
‐GUILLERMO:
Don't touch the metal.
‐Prod. Ow!

05:40.741 --> 05:43.143
‐Shit!
‐NANDOR: Ay, shit.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.245
‐You okay?
‐No!
‐LASZLO: Let's go.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.680
We've lingered here long enough.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.615
He'll just do
his mind magic on us.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.051
‐What?
‐That's probably what he's doing
with my cattle prod.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.120
‐GUILLERMO: No, don't touch
that end, Colin Rob...
‐Ow!

05:53.153 --> 05:55.789
‐NANDOR: Ay, fuck.
‐Shit! That one was on me.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.125
‐Not giving you credit
for that one.
‐GUILLERMO: I don't want credit.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.994
We will make a judgement
about your future shortly.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.362
And who's gonna
protect you, huh?

06:02.396 --> 06:04.064
I'm not asking

06:04.097 --> 06:05.566
for any kind
of special treatment!

06:05.599 --> 06:08.068
I'm just want to protect you
from yourselves!

06:08.101 --> 06:09.369
Laszlo. Laszlo?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.672
‐No, Laszlo...
‐(electricity buzzing)

06:11.705 --> 06:13.106
COLIN:
Ow, Fuck!

06:15.075 --> 06:18.278
Okay, so, day 30
of imprisonment.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.380
Not bad, actually.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.516
I get pretty good Wi‐Fi
down here, so I've been able

06:22.549 --> 06:24.585
to rewatch some of my favorites.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.787
Did another round
of Gilmore Girls. (chuckles)

06:26.820 --> 06:29.156
I can show you around
if you want, give you a tour.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.125
Here, this is my bed.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.594
Here's my mini fridge.

06:33.627 --> 06:37.064
And there's the chicken
they think I eat raw.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.333
And some Yoo‐hoos.

06:39.366 --> 06:43.170
And that is where I, um... yeah.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.405
Without me, the vampires
don't know what they're doing.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.541
Like, literally they can't
do anything without me.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.176
They can't even
imprison someone.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.477
You want to see something cool?

06:50.511 --> 06:53.747
Here's a little secret.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.020
What I've been doing
is I've been

07:00.053 --> 07:02.489
sneaking out
when they go into slumber.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.758
Colin Robinson heads out
to work by 9:45,

07:04.791 --> 07:07.127
so I'm up by then.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.330
I've been coming up here
and doing all the things

07:10.364 --> 07:12.232
that need to be done
to keep the house functioning.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.468
♪ ♪

07:15.335 --> 07:16.770
Of course
they don't notice, because

07:16.803 --> 07:18.372
they just think
it happens automatically.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.240
It doesn't.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.209
I do it.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.211
Heads up.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.147
I mean, I should
really just consider

07:27.181 --> 07:28.182
escaping,

07:28.215 --> 07:29.683
And leaving.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.451
And never coming back.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.354
Especially
'cause they're considering

07:34.388 --> 07:36.023
you know, killing me.
(laughs)

07:36.056 --> 07:37.624
‐Thank you.
‐But I just wonder what

07:37.658 --> 07:39.660
would happen if I wasn't here
to help them out.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.528
They're like family.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.729
I know‐‐

07:42.763 --> 07:44.398
codependent much?

(crows cawing)

07:54.552 --> 07:56.321
NADJA:
Look, I, too have developed

07:56.354 --> 07:57.856
a small seed of affection

07:57.889 --> 08:00.191
for Guillermo,
but the vampire code stands.

08:00.225 --> 08:02.394
He killed vampires,
therefore he must be killed.

08:02.427 --> 08:04.362
NANDOR:
What about the warrior's code?

08:04.396 --> 08:06.598
A man who saves your life
in battle should be owed

08:06.631 --> 08:09.167
a debt of eternal
gratitude and mercy.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.536
Ah, yeah, the, uh,
perennial conundrum between

08:11.570 --> 08:14.506
‐the warrior code
and the vampire code...
‐(thud)

08:14.539 --> 08:16.474
What... Uh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what was that?

08:16.508 --> 08:18.743
NADJA:
Oh, you know what, it's probably
one of the black birds

08:18.777 --> 08:20.278
that's been
gathering outside lately.

08:37.329 --> 08:39.297
(Nandor grunts)

08:39.331 --> 08:40.699

08:40.732 --> 08:42.634
How you holding up?

08:42.667 --> 08:45.170
Yeah, comme ci, comme ça.

08:45.203 --> 08:47.105
I don't know what that means.

08:47.138 --> 08:50.175
So... has there been any updates

08:50.208 --> 08:52.677
‐on... my fate?
‐No.

08:52.711 --> 08:55.146
It's really looking like we're
going to end up killing you.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.415
Well...

08:57.449 --> 08:59.584
‐I'm a soldier.
‐Yes.

08:59.618 --> 09:02.087
Not a great warrior
like you, of course, but...

09:02.120 --> 09:04.422
‐Oh, thank you.
‐...a soldier nonetheless.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.124
Who saved your life.

09:06.157 --> 09:07.692
And would do it again
in a heartbeat.

09:08.827 --> 09:10.729
'Cause that's
the code I live by.

09:10.762 --> 09:12.597
The code of the warrior.

09:14.399 --> 09:16.201
Yes.

09:16.234 --> 09:17.869
This is what I've been
trying to tell them.

09:17.903 --> 09:19.437
You are?

09:19.471 --> 09:21.473
There's a code
amongst warriors.

09:21.506 --> 09:23.275
‐The warriors code.
‐Yes.

09:23.308 --> 09:27.145
Sadly, I am but a lone voice
crying out in the...

09:27.178 --> 09:28.546
wilderness.

09:28.580 --> 09:31.383
(grunts)

09:31.416 --> 09:33.618
Ow.
Fucking splinter in my foot.

09:33.652 --> 09:35.387
Which reminds me.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.589
I brought you your dinner.

09:37.622 --> 09:40.191
‐The chicken.
‐Yes.

09:40.225 --> 09:42.494
I let it warm up to room
temperature for a few days.

09:42.527 --> 09:43.762
Oh... mm.

09:43.795 --> 09:46.097
‐I'll leave the light on.
‐Thank you.

09:46.131 --> 09:47.465
(door closes)

09:48.433 --> 09:50.869
(cawing)

09:50.902 --> 09:53.305
(phone chiming)

09:53.338 --> 09:55.307
I put these security cameras
everywhere just to make sure

09:55.340 --> 09:57.075
the vampires are safe.

09:57.108 --> 09:59.077
Usually, the only alerts
I get are when raccoons get into

09:59.110 --> 10:01.346
the trash cans or Laszlo
goes out to the potting shed

10:01.379 --> 10:03.782
in the back yard
to, uh, whack off.

10:03.815 --> 10:05.817
But...

10:09.421 --> 10:10.488
What the hell?

10:19.197 --> 10:21.099
And you're comfortable
slumbering in your coffin

10:21.132 --> 10:23.568
knowing that bloody Guillermo's
poncing around the house?

10:23.602 --> 10:26.171
We could get locks
for our coffins‐‐ inside locks.

10:26.204 --> 10:28.073
Does such a thing even exist?

10:28.106 --> 10:29.708
LASZLO:
I can't even slumber
knowing he's downstairs

10:29.741 --> 10:31.810
in that basement,
so I've been...

10:31.843 --> 10:34.079
busy in my potting shed.

10:34.112 --> 10:36.081
Well, I've continued

10:36.114 --> 10:38.817
to sift through
his stinky pickles

10:38.850 --> 10:41.653
from his toilet bucket,
and I can confirm

10:41.686 --> 10:44.489
he's not smuggling out
any secret messages.

10:44.522 --> 10:46.258
Good work, Colin Robinson.
(clears throat)

10:46.291 --> 10:48.727
But I will continue
to sift through it

10:48.760 --> 10:50.829
on a daily basis in...

10:50.862 --> 10:52.631
‐The...
‐What?

10:52.897 --> 10:55.133
(all gasping, whimpering)

10:57.302 --> 10:59.137
Stand back!

10:59.170 --> 11:01.506
(all exclaiming)

11:03.541 --> 11:06.444
NADJA:
Laszlo, get down!

11:06.478 --> 11:08.213
Ooh!
What the heck?!

11:08.246 --> 11:09.748
You hit me with a stake!

11:09.781 --> 11:11.616
Stand back!
She's trying to kill all of you.

11:11.650 --> 11:13.518
See, this is what I'm talking
about. He's a good soldier.

11:13.551 --> 11:16.521
‐He's gonna kill us all!
‐I'm not trying to kill anyone.

11:16.554 --> 11:18.156
‐I'm not trying to kill anyone,
either... except for you!
‐GUIDE: Great.

11:18.189 --> 11:19.724
‐Whoa.
‐NANDOR: Good catch.

11:19.758 --> 11:20.725
Thank you.

11:20.759 --> 11:22.360
Chillax, familiar.

11:22.394 --> 11:24.229
We get it:
you're a vampire‐killer,

11:24.262 --> 11:26.665
with the stakes and the reflexes
and all that‐‐ great job.

11:26.698 --> 11:28.400
‐(claps)
‐Yay. Now,

11:28.433 --> 11:29.768
‐may I speak?
‐LASZLO: You may speak,

11:29.801 --> 11:31.703
dark shade, but, remember,

11:31.736 --> 11:33.538
no bullshit from thy mouth.

11:33.572 --> 11:35.106
COLIN:
But before you speak,

11:35.140 --> 11:37.208
how did the prisoner
get out of his cage?

11:37.242 --> 11:40.111
‐I'll tell you later.
‐Okay, but what about
your poop bucket?

11:40.145 --> 11:43.214
I mean, is it empty, half‐empty,
mostly liquid,

11:43.248 --> 11:44.649
or are there some Lincoln Logs
in there for me?

11:44.683 --> 11:45.817
‐Okay.
‐GUIDE: Listen, everyone,

11:45.850 --> 11:47.552
I didn't mean to alarm you,

11:47.586 --> 11:48.853
but we haven't heard from you.

11:48.887 --> 11:52.123
We sent 87 ravens
to summon you...

11:52.157 --> 11:54.159
which is a big deal
for our budget.

11:54.192 --> 11:55.727
‐Oh, that makes sense‐‐
all the ravens.
‐(overlapping muttering)

11:55.760 --> 11:57.295
Okay.
So you did see them,

11:57.329 --> 11:58.830
and you did nothing,
just like last time?

11:58.863 --> 12:02.133
Well, maybe you could
try using the telephone?

12:02.167 --> 12:03.535
We did try the telephone.

12:03.568 --> 12:05.370
It is Guillermo's job
to answer the telephone.

12:05.403 --> 12:07.339
I'm sorry, but why did you not
answer the telephone?

12:07.372 --> 12:09.140
Because you had me in a cage
in the basement!

12:09.174 --> 12:11.176
Always an excuse
with this wise guy.

12:11.209 --> 12:13.545
GUIDE:
All right, on to
the business at hand.

12:13.578 --> 12:16.681
I come to you

12:16.715 --> 12:20.385
from the Supreme Worldwide
Vampiric Council.

12:21.786 --> 12:24.522
‐Oh, shit.
‐Yes, the council that rules

12:24.556 --> 12:26.258
over all other councils.

12:26.291 --> 12:29.261
Now, do you have a VCR?

12:29.294 --> 12:31.329
‐A what?
‐How are you spelling that?

12:31.363 --> 12:33.398
V‐C‐R.

12:33.431 --> 12:34.566
‐"Visar."
‐No.

12:39.237 --> 12:40.472
‐Is this really necessary?
‐NANDOR: Yes, it is.

12:40.505 --> 12:42.340
GUIDE:
Vampires all, draw ye near

12:42.374 --> 12:44.075

from the Supreme Worldwide
Vampiric Council.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.212

Leslie "Laszlo" Cravensworth
and Colin Rubenstein,

13:08.600 --> 13:10.068
I applaud you.

13:11.503 --> 13:13.838
Congratulations. With the help
of your bloodthirsty minion,

13:13.872 --> 13:16.174
you have eliminated almost

13:16.207 --> 13:18.543
70% of the most
powerful vampires

13:18.577 --> 13:20.512
in the Tri‐State area.

13:20.545 --> 13:23.214
What?
He's here now?

13:23.248 --> 13:25.450
‐Right when I'm doing
this piece? Tell him to go

not sarcastic,

13:27.819 --> 13:29.588
‐What's the other word
that sort of means "sarcastic"?
‐Okay, where was I?

13:29.621 --> 13:31.189
‐Ah, yes.
‐Begins with "F."

13:31.222 --> 13:33.625
Lest you think
I'm being facetious,

13:33.658 --> 13:34.693
‐That's the word.
‐I can assure you

13:34.726 --> 13:36.361
I am not.

13:36.394 --> 13:39.464
"Vampire must
never kill vampire."

13:39.497 --> 13:42.367
Is that not the thing
that we say all the time?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.736
‐We do. Uh... some of us do.
‐At dinner parties

13:44.769 --> 13:46.238
‐I do.
‐and at social gatherings,
we come and say,

13:46.271 --> 13:47.339
"Hey, how's it going, Jeffrey?

13:47.372 --> 13:49.507
Vampire shall not kill vampire,"

13:49.541 --> 13:52.611
just to remind ourselves
of that big law that we made

13:52.644 --> 13:53.778
many, many years ago.

13:53.812 --> 13:55.714
But when a vampire kills, like,

13:55.747 --> 13:58.783
37, 38 vampires?

13:58.817 --> 14:00.252
Well, these are vampires

14:00.285 --> 14:02.520
who know how to get things done.

14:02.554 --> 14:04.723
‐Oh, isn't he great?
‐(exclaiming)
‐So this is why

14:04.756 --> 14:06.591

14:21.640 --> 14:24.476
We will be monitoring
your progress.

14:24.509 --> 14:28.113
And with that, I bid you adieu.

14:28.146 --> 14:29.481
‐Adieu to you.
‐Yeah, yeah.
‐NANDOR: A dude.

14:29.514 --> 14:31.416
‐FML.
‐Hell yeah.

14:31.449 --> 14:33.652
I love thrones‐‐
they're my favorite chair.

14:33.685 --> 14:35.320
It is a great honor.

14:35.353 --> 14:37.489
But, also, you know,
quite a responsibility.

14:37.522 --> 14:39.291
COLIN:
Well, I've been on the local

14:39.324 --> 14:41.559
Vampiric Council
for a few years now.

14:41.593 --> 14:44.329
Mainly at
an entry‐level position.

14:44.362 --> 14:46.298
I... Well, what can I say?

14:46.331 --> 14:48.466
It's good to be the king.
(chuckles)

Mel Brooks,
History of the World: Part I.

14:50.602 --> 14:52.270
LASZLO:
I didn't become a vampire

14:52.304 --> 14:54.239
to end up
a pen‐pushing bureaucrat.

14:54.272 --> 14:57.676
I became a vampire to suck blood
and to fuck forever.

14:57.709 --> 15:01.413
‐But you must admit,
this is quite an honor.
‐I couldn't give a fuck.

15:01.446 --> 15:05.083
Push the stop button.
It is the record button.

15:05.116 --> 15:06.585
‐GUILLERMO:
Should I turn it off?
‐Who is he talking to?

15:06.618 --> 15:08.119
‐GUIDE: Just turn it off.

fearsome and legendary councils.

15:12.591 --> 15:14.259
Lords and lady,

15:14.292 --> 15:17.395
I have assisted every local

15:17.429 --> 15:20.165
Vampiric Council since 1759.

15:20.198 --> 15:21.533
The best of the best.

15:21.566 --> 15:25.070
I now stand charged
with assisting you.

15:25.103 --> 15:26.605
‐Nice.
‐All right.

15:26.638 --> 15:29.074
And now we have these guys.

15:29.107 --> 15:31.176
Which is...

15:31.209 --> 15:33.645
whatever, you know,
it's above my pay grade.

15:33.678 --> 15:35.480
NADJA:
You know, it isn't
just an honor.

15:35.513 --> 15:37.249
It is also a nine‐to‐five.

15:37.282 --> 15:40.085
You know, full‐time working job.
I'm a working woman.

15:40.118 --> 15:43.555
This is now a documentary
about Vampire Council leaders.

15:43.588 --> 15:46.358
I will take you upon tomorrow's
eve to Vampiric Council

15:46.391 --> 15:48.793
headquarters so that
you may assume the throne.

15:48.827 --> 15:50.862
Once the leader of men.

15:50.895 --> 15:53.465
Now a leader of vampires.

15:53.498 --> 15:56.334
But one matter still remains:

15:56.368 --> 15:59.037
what to do about Guillermo?

16:00.805 --> 16:03.108
‐Do you have to chain me?
‐Uh, no.

16:03.141 --> 16:04.442
Then why did you do it?

16:04.476 --> 16:05.610
Well, seemed kind of fun.

16:05.644 --> 16:06.811
All right, get in there.

16:06.845 --> 16:09.381
Kneel before your masters, fool.

16:09.414 --> 16:10.615
I will not kneel.

16:10.649 --> 16:13.118
All right, then. Shit.

16:13.151 --> 16:15.520
Who‐who took the batteries
out of my proddy?

16:15.553 --> 16:18.089
‐Just let him stand there,
Colin Robinson.
‐We all agreed

16:18.123 --> 16:20.692
‐I could prod him one more time.
‐Yeah, yeah, well, you tried,
and nothing happened.

16:20.725 --> 16:22.327
We have a lot to get through
this evening.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.863
(clears throat)
Guillermo...

16:24.896 --> 16:27.432
de la... eh...

16:27.465 --> 16:28.733
What is it again?

16:28.767 --> 16:30.769
‐Um, Greenberg?
‐De la Cruz.

16:30.802 --> 16:32.837
‐Oh.
‐We have come to a final

16:32.871 --> 16:35.106
decision regarding your fate.

16:35.140 --> 16:38.209
All those in favor of revealing
this decision, say aye!

16:38.243 --> 16:39.444
ALL:
Aye!

16:39.477 --> 16:40.579
It's unanimous.

16:40.612 --> 16:43.481
In the case of Guillermo
Greenberg

16:43.515 --> 16:44.849
‐de la Cruz
‐Not my name.

16:44.883 --> 16:48.186
in the killing
of many, many vampires,

16:48.219 --> 16:51.323
we have come to a final decision
regarding your fate.

16:51.356 --> 16:53.158
We have decided...

16:54.392 --> 16:56.861
‐Drum roll.
‐Thank you.

16:56.895 --> 16:58.663
(Nadja imitates cymbal crash)

17:00.131 --> 17:01.499
...not to kill you.

17:01.533 --> 17:02.767
NADJA:
At least not right now

17:02.801 --> 17:03.735
and not for
this particular thing,

17:03.768 --> 17:05.503
but my eyes are on you.

17:05.537 --> 17:07.239
You were shitting yourself there
for a second, weren't you?

17:07.272 --> 17:09.274
‐Little bit.
‐In fact,
for our own protection,

17:09.307 --> 17:11.076
we have decided

17:11.109 --> 17:13.612
to make you a fully‐fledged
member of the team.

17:13.645 --> 17:15.146
What?

17:16.181 --> 17:17.749
You're gonna make me a vampire.

17:17.782 --> 17:19.351
‐Course we're fucking not,
‐What?

17:19.384 --> 17:20.652
‐you idiot.
‐Fucking kidding me. (laughs)

17:20.685 --> 17:22.220
NANDOR:
No, we're gonna do something

17:22.254 --> 17:23.555
much better than that.

17:23.588 --> 17:25.156
Do you want to do
another drum roll or...

17:25.190 --> 17:26.424
‐I don't think drum roll's...
‐NADJA: No. I...

17:26.458 --> 17:28.460
‐That is it.
‐We are gonna make you

17:28.493 --> 17:30.562
a vampires'...

17:30.595 --> 17:32.364
‐bodyguard.
‐Ah!

17:32.397 --> 17:33.865
‐Hmm.
‐NANDOR: Exciting.

17:33.898 --> 17:35.834
Not... not really
what "a fully‐fledged

17:35.867 --> 17:37.769
‐member of the group"
kind of person...
‐NADJA: Well, excuse me,

17:37.802 --> 17:40.171
it's a big bloody step up
from being a familiar,

17:40.205 --> 17:41.840
and it's way better
than being dead,

17:41.873 --> 17:44.142
‐so you gonna
take it or leave it?
‐Take it.

17:44.175 --> 17:46.511
‐Okay. I'll take it.
‐NANDOR: Okay, good.

17:46.544 --> 17:49.281
All those in favor of accepting
his acceptance, say aye!

17:49.314 --> 17:51.216
ALL:
Aye!

17:51.249 --> 17:53.418
Okay. Great. Unanimous...
Uh, tut, tut, tut...

17:53.451 --> 17:55.620
Before you remove the chains,

17:55.654 --> 17:58.189
there's just, uh, another thing
that you will have to do

17:58.223 --> 18:00.258
for it to be,
you know, finalized.

18:00.292 --> 18:02.627
This thing, it might, uh...

18:02.661 --> 18:04.796
might be a little bit dangerous.
For you.

18:04.829 --> 18:06.197
Vampiric hypnosis

18:06.231 --> 18:08.700
is a very powerful tool,

18:08.733 --> 18:10.869
which, if improperly used

18:10.902 --> 18:13.572
by the hypnotizer,
can really mess up the mind

18:13.605 --> 18:15.140
of the hypnotizee.

18:15.173 --> 18:16.341
NADJA:
And the twice‐as‐powerful

18:16.374 --> 18:17.709
double hypnosis can lead

18:17.742 --> 18:19.544
to weak brain or, even worse,

18:19.578 --> 18:21.179
the thoughtless Sallies.

18:21.212 --> 18:23.281
And if things
go very, very tits‐up,

18:23.315 --> 18:26.251
you end up with full‐blown
brain scramblies.

18:26.284 --> 18:28.153
LASZLO:
As we both know, my darling,

18:28.186 --> 18:30.221
from experience,
but take that up a notch.

18:30.255 --> 18:31.456
to a three‐way hypnosis,

18:31.489 --> 18:33.124
well, then you might be

18:33.158 --> 18:35.360
faced with
the purple screaming Henries.

18:35.393 --> 18:37.128
Or worse still...

18:37.162 --> 18:39.230
half‐man, half‐madness.

18:39.264 --> 18:41.166
NANDOR:
But desperate times

18:41.199 --> 18:43.268
call for desperate measures.

18:43.301 --> 18:44.803
So, a four‐way hypnosis?

18:44.836 --> 18:46.538
NADJA:
Yes, and we've actually

18:46.571 --> 18:48.607
never ever done
one of those before, so...

18:48.640 --> 18:50.809
LASZLO:
Yeah, and the odds against
you being normal afterwards

18:50.842 --> 18:54.179
‐are pretty fucking low.
‐Do you think I can have
a minute to think about it?

18:54.212 --> 18:56.548
The prisoner needs
a moment to think about it.

18:56.581 --> 18:59.284
It's okay.
I thought about it.

18:59.317 --> 19:01.386
He's thunk about it.

19:01.419 --> 19:03.722
Okay.
And I agree.

19:03.755 --> 19:05.557
‐Great.
‐Yeah, being alone
in that cell

19:05.590 --> 19:07.492
down there
gives you a lot of time.

19:07.525 --> 19:10.228
‐Mm.
‐And you guys‐‐
you're like my family.

19:10.262 --> 19:12.597
It's okay, you don't have
to give us your life story.

19:12.631 --> 19:14.499
‐We get it. Should we, uh...
‐LASZLO: Yeah.

19:14.532 --> 19:16.101
Assume the position.

19:16.134 --> 19:17.502
What position would that be?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.137
I haven't got a fucking clue.
What is it?

19:19.170 --> 19:20.739
Uh, stand there,
we'll come to you.

19:20.772 --> 19:22.274
‐Yes.
‐Good idea.

19:22.307 --> 19:25.243
‐(Nandor clears throat)
‐(all vocalizing)

19:25.277 --> 19:26.578
NANDOR:
Quadruple hypnosis.

19:26.611 --> 19:28.280
ALL:
Guillermo...

19:28.313 --> 19:31.483
Greenberg de la Cruz,

19:31.516 --> 19:34.286
you will now find yourself

19:34.319 --> 19:36.288
in a trance‐like state.

19:36.321 --> 19:37.689
GUILLERMO:
Between you and I,

19:37.722 --> 19:40.759
vampire hypnosis
doesn't work on me anymore.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.160
I mean, it used to, years ago,

19:42.193 --> 19:43.561
when they first
started doing it.

19:43.595 --> 19:45.363
But I guess after a while,
my body just...

19:45.397 --> 19:47.299
got immune to it.

19:47.332 --> 19:51.136
ALL:
When you awaken, and for
the rest of your natural life,

19:51.169 --> 19:54.773
you will
in no way harm Nandor...

19:54.806 --> 19:57.142
GUILLERMO:
And they used to use it
on the stupidest things, too.

19:57.175 --> 19:58.376
Things I would've done anyways.

19:58.410 --> 19:59.644
Gizmo, stop doing that.

19:59.678 --> 20:00.845
Could you do me a small favor?

20:00.879 --> 20:02.614
Fetch me the book,

20:02.647 --> 20:05.216
which is next
to my father's ashes.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.851
Do it a bit quicker because

20:06.885 --> 20:09.087
you are interrupting
my magazine reading.

20:09.120 --> 20:13.224
Now go into the basement
and fetch my witch's skin hat.

20:13.258 --> 20:14.359
Don't you fucking dare.

20:14.392 --> 20:15.794
So, yeah.

20:15.827 --> 20:17.596
I just let them think
they can hypnotize me.

20:17.629 --> 20:19.764
Who's gonna know the difference?

20:19.798 --> 20:22.434
‐(all chanting)
‐Wait, wait, wait. Also...

20:22.467 --> 20:25.303
whenever Colin Robinson
says your name,

20:25.337 --> 20:28.406
you will meow like a kitty cat.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.175
The...

20:30.208 --> 20:31.710
ALL:
End.

20:31.743 --> 20:33.311
Colin Robinson, why did you
have to add that bit?

20:33.345 --> 20:35.480
It's for me, all right?!
For me!

20:35.513 --> 20:36.581
(exhales)

20:36.615 --> 20:39.317
Guillermo... awaken.

20:39.351 --> 20:40.785
(gasps)

20:40.819 --> 20:42.721
Is your brain fully operational?

20:42.754 --> 20:45.457
‐Yeah, I'm fine.
‐He's not fine.

20:45.490 --> 20:47.292
He's got that slack jaw,
half‐wit look.

20:47.325 --> 20:49.261
Guillermo, you will now

20:49.294 --> 20:51.730
take Colin Robinson's
peen and scrotum

20:51.763 --> 20:53.465
and crush it in your hand.

20:53.498 --> 20:54.633
‐What? No.
‐Good idea.

20:54.666 --> 20:55.800
LASZLO:
Yeah.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.269
NANDOR:
He's gonna do it.

20:57.302 --> 20:58.803
I'm afraid I can't, Master.

20:58.837 --> 21:00.839
As much as I would love to,

21:00.872 --> 21:03.074
something compels me not to.

21:03.108 --> 21:05.543
‐It worked! Yay!
‐It worked! (laughs)
‐Yeah, wait, wait, wait! No, no.

21:05.577 --> 21:07.679
‐NANDOR: Yes!
‐Hold on, hold on. Guillermo?

21:07.712 --> 21:09.714
‐Meow.
‐(laughing)

21:09.748 --> 21:11.416
It worked.

21:17.385 --> 21:19.888
NANDOR: This building. Eesh!

21:19.921 --> 21:22.390
Still sends shivers
through my bones.

21:22.424 --> 21:23.892
Last time we were here
we were sentenced

21:23.925 --> 21:25.427
to death
by the Vampiric Council.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.796
Had we not escaped
from this cack house...

21:27.829 --> 21:29.731
‐I saved them.
‐We saved them.

21:29.764 --> 21:31.800
Had we not escaped
from this fluorescent mausoleum,

21:31.833 --> 21:33.668
we'd be fucking dead.

21:33.702 --> 21:35.370
First... thank you.

21:35.403 --> 21:37.973
NANDOR:
Does anyone remember
how the elevator works?

21:38.006 --> 21:40.108
NADJA:
Nandor, just tell it
to take us to the dungeon.

21:40.142 --> 21:42.144
COLIN:
I think it's P3.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.212
(elevator bell dings)

21:46.948 --> 21:48.717
‐NANDOR: Oh.
‐GUIDE: This is
my favorite room.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.118
‐NANDOR: This is lovely.
‐LASZLO: Very nice.

21:50.152 --> 21:52.754
GUIDE:
And I'm sure you'll all remember

21:52.787 --> 21:54.322
‐the judgement chamber.
‐LASZLO: No.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.291
NANDOR:
How could we forget?

21:56.324 --> 21:59.127
Yes.
I remember it well.

21:59.161 --> 22:00.996
The last time
we were in this very room,

22:01.029 --> 22:03.331
we were sentenced to death
and Wesley Snipes

22:03.365 --> 22:06.001
‐was right over there
on a laptop.
‐GUIDE: Right.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.636
And now you're the ones
who will be

22:07.669 --> 22:09.337
sentencing other vampires
to death.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.972
‐Yes!
‐Yes.
‐GUIDE: Which

22:11.006 --> 22:12.674
doesn't really
make a lot of sense to me.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.076
(laughs) But, whatever,
above my pay grade.

22:15.110 --> 22:16.344
I am here to serve.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.779
Good for you.
That's great.

22:17.813 --> 22:19.748
NADJA:
Well, it's much bigger and

22:19.781 --> 22:21.683
‐more impressive
than I remember.
‐Yes.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.919
Feel a little bit
chilly willies, too.

22:23.952 --> 22:25.387
‐Oh.
‐NANDOR: It is a little cold.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.888
‐GUIDE: These are the wraiths.
‐Oh, great,

22:26.922 --> 22:28.657
I'm fucking freezing.

22:28.690 --> 22:30.058
‐Oh!
‐GUIDE: Do not fear them‐‐

22:30.091 --> 22:31.126
‐they are here to serve us.
‐Thank you.

22:31.159 --> 22:32.861
NANDOR:
Thanks a lot.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.329
Darling, it's almost
as soft as you are.

22:34.362 --> 22:36.064
LASZLO:
Mm, very nice.

22:36.097 --> 22:37.999
Are they gonna come back
with another one? 'Cause...

22:38.033 --> 22:39.801
Membership has its privileges.

22:39.835 --> 22:41.136
Clearly.

22:41.169 --> 22:43.705
Now, before we get
down to business...

22:43.738 --> 22:46.007
‐(snaps fingers)
‐(Nandor exclaims)

22:46.041 --> 22:47.409
‐Ooh, nice.
‐GUIDE: Which one of you

22:47.442 --> 22:49.945
will assume the Master's Throne?

22:49.978 --> 22:52.113
Is there not a throne
for all of us?

22:52.147 --> 22:55.283
(laughing)

22:56.451 --> 22:58.186
No!

22:58.220 --> 22:59.955
I just... I assumed, you know,
because there is more

22:59.988 --> 23:01.189
than one of us, there will be
more than one throne.

23:01.223 --> 23:02.924
‐This is it. Listen.
‐LASZLO: Oh.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.426
You're all
on the Vampiric Council,

23:04.459 --> 23:06.094
‐All of us?
‐But those... All four of you.

23:06.127 --> 23:08.763
But only one of you can be
the supreme leader.

23:08.797 --> 23:11.299
The one who rules
over all vampires.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.769
All vampires
in the local New York area.

23:14.803 --> 23:17.139
And also is the boss
over all the other members

23:17.172 --> 23:19.241
of the Council‐‐ only one.

23:19.274 --> 23:21.743
So who will be
the supreme leader

23:21.776 --> 23:23.044
who rules over all others?

23:23.078 --> 23:25.947
‐Um...
‐Fuck no.

23:25.981 --> 23:28.717
‐I'll do it.
‐I think I'm probably the best
one for it, probably I think...

23:28.750 --> 23:30.018
They're idiots.

23:30.051 --> 23:31.987
Haven't decided yet,
Colin Robinson!

23:32.020 --> 23:33.421
‐You will not take it!
‐We've to make
a decision together!
