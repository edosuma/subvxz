[glass breaking]

01:43.103 --> 01:44.605
(Beeping)

01:46.240 --> 01:48.242
(Metal door opens)

01:55.583 --> 01:57.451
Just take a seat, Dana.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.987
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.435
Just when you're ready.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.142
DANA: Have they
given you a date yet?

02:22.243 --> 02:23.744
Not yet.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.147
I heard it's soon.
What are you going to do?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.749
He can't say...

02:32.152 --> 02:35.088
..where he's going, who
he's with, what he's doing,

02:35.189 --> 02:37.057
anything like that.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.060
I suggest you ask
what you came to ask.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.631
DANA: Where is he?

02:50.671 --> 02:53.641
JAMES: When I left,
he was in the water.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.045
DANA: Did you push him out?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.680
JAMES: No.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.583
DANA: How deep was he,
over his head?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.453
JAMES: Not real deep.

03:12.125 --> 03:16.864
DANA: We've had divers search
right up and down there.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.799
JAMES: It's not far
from the sea there.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.168
DANA:
But you didn't push him out?

03:21.302 --> 03:22.836
JAMES: I never lied.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.240
DANA: This doctor is saying
your epilepsy's

03:26.374 --> 03:28.942
made you forget things -
it's not true, is it?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.978
Did you weigh him down...

03:32.346 --> 03:36.016
..or did you take him
to the bushes?

03:36.149 --> 03:38.352
JAMES:
It wasn't just me there.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.554
DANA: I don't have him, do I?

03:48.128 --> 03:51.164
So you wouldn't forget
pushing him out?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.237
It's killing me.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.642
I can't keep looking.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.579
I'm the only one
that still is.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.083
JAMES: The police
should have found him.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.253
DANA: They didn't need to.
They had you.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.376
He was the front page
of all the papers

04:35.509 --> 04:37.445
when he went missing,

04:37.545 --> 04:41.949
and now no-one even remembers
his name.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.386
(Sobs)

04:51.859 --> 04:53.827
You hid him. You had to.

04:55.195 --> 04:58.632
Did you mutilate him, did you
do something sexual to my son?

04:58.732 --> 05:00.668
RITA: Dana...
- Did you?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.170
RITA: You know what
we agreed on.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.806
DANA: I went to sleep
for a half an hour,

05:05.939 --> 05:08.342
and my son is gone.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.717
I don't believe you.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.252
I don't believe you.

05:24.725 --> 05:28.462
Until I find him,
he's still just missing.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.040
MAN: Four bucks, Anthony.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.876
Didn't you get the photo
I sent you?

06:16.009 --> 06:18.812
I'm not giving you freebies
no more.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.684
Why don't you just take it off
what you owe me?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.631
(Dog barks)

06:43.036 --> 06:44.538
And sign here.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.586
RITA: Anthony and his family

06:58.719 --> 07:00.854
have taken out
an intervention order.

07:00.954 --> 07:05.058
You can't contact him or go
within a 5km radius of them.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.127
JAMES: Witness to crime.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.664
RITA: Witnesses get notified
of parole.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.299
They can ask to be protected.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.870
Bullshit.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.506
Good.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.642
Now, you'll be sick
of the sound of my voice

07:21.742 --> 07:23.544
every 24 hours for a month,

07:23.677 --> 07:26.079
and then you report every 72
after that.

07:26.213 --> 07:30.017
Zero tolerance.
Same goes for violence.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.522
Any whiff of violence and a
magistrate may revoke parole.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.157
You're a fisticuffs fan.
Don't do it.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.695
We've got you
in a halfway house.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.964
You've got your own room.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.635
Do you want these?

07:49.737 --> 07:51.371
Books and magazines.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.542
I don't need them.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.045
Worth getting sprung tonight?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.748
OK for you,
you're gone tomorrow.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.154
Bet I get some motherfucker
in here.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.722
Don't do that.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.659
Night-time's when
you get all negative.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.699
OK, maybe worth it.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.631
JAMES: He still lives there.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.735
CELLMATE: What do you think
he's like now?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.004
A coward.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.441
Don't say goodbye.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.862
(Thumping music, conversation)

09:48.221 --> 09:49.723
Yes, Mum. Yes.

09:54.962 --> 09:59.066
(Music grows louder, someone
hitting a punching bag)

10:04.938 --> 10:06.674
Don't you eat egg anymore?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.375
I hate it, and onion.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.014
'The lot' means
'egg and onion'.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.683
They're stingy on the sauce.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.822
How long have you guys
been going out?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.957
We're just friends.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.625
What does he do?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.227
He drives a truck.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.963
Cool.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.837
You heard from Dad?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.471
A few weeks back.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.976
What did he say?

10:43.076 --> 10:46.313
He said that if you needed
anything, he'd help.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.948
Does he have a spare room?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.549
He meant money.

10:53.821 --> 10:57.424
Your place is pretty big.
You said you had no room.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.793
It's not about having no room.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.839
Why are you looking at me?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.473
You know, at lunch,

11:13.573 --> 11:16.877
if someone was looking at me,
I'd be like...

11:20.213 --> 11:23.516
A guy got stabbed in the mouth
the other day.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.855
Tried to get him in the neck,
but he missed.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.073
It's too easy
for people to find me.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.177
It's happened before -
reporters and, you know,

11:50.310 --> 11:51.945
people connected with family.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.713
This is for your own good.

11:53.847 --> 11:58.318
Here, I'll pay
until you start earning.

12:01.188 --> 12:04.157
I don't want you
forgetting to report.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.130
PAIGE: What did you do today?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.731
JAMES: Not much.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.568
What about tomorrow,
you going to do something?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.355
(Heavy thudding)

14:16.656 --> 14:18.992
(A young man
and a woman argue)

14:22.862 --> 14:24.364
MAN: Nads, for fuck's sake!

14:24.497 --> 14:26.866
Why do you always want
to play with my bloody stuff?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.803
- Five seconds of peace!
- Leave it the fuck alone!

14:30.938 --> 14:32.705
- Damien!
- Mum!

14:32.839 --> 14:35.008
This is my fucking iPad.
Fuck you!

* CLASSICAL SYMPHONY

14:50.857 --> 14:52.792
(Voice muffled by music)

14:53.793 --> 14:55.428
I said, it's hot, hey?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.032
Can I ask you something?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.736
Do you know a guy called
Anthony?

15:03.870 --> 15:05.372
A dark-haired guy.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.507
He lives up the mountain road

15:07.640 --> 15:10.143
but cuts through here
sometimes.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.744
I hate everyone.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.317
Alright.

(Classical symphony resumes)

15:37.504 --> 15:39.006

15:42.309 --> 15:44.677
Can I have
a packet of silvers?

15:46.579 --> 15:48.848
And our power's not on.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.750
- Which plot?
- It's 33.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.324
You pay your day rate,
and that gets your mains on.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.559
Alright, just give me a day.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.495
- Can I see some ID?
- I don't have any.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.465
I need to know
who's on the grounds.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.001
Well, how much is a day?

16:08.135 --> 16:09.636
22 bucks.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.305
Well,
I'll just have a day, then.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.974
I'll need a photocopy
of your ID.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.377
It's my family's cabin.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.713
Who is Paige Levy? Levi?

16:20.847 --> 16:22.349
What does it matter?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.585
Ah, $12.50, love.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.958
- There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.202
I'll just pay for the smokes.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.737
I don't need
the fucking power.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.204
(Phone rings)

17:21.674 --> 17:24.477
Hi. Sorry, I can't
take your call at the moment.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.378
Please leave a message.

17:26.512 --> 17:30.049
Yeah, Paige? This is Gary from
Crystal Brook Holiday park.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.153
I think I might have your son
in your cabin.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.754
He hasn't checked in properly.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.356
My sister's boy.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.990
Alright.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.499
TV: Humans do not know

17:46.633 --> 17:49.836
there are other life forms

17:49.969 --> 17:52.139
There is only one rule -

17:52.239 --> 17:57.043
never go out without
morphing into human form.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.046
What happened to your eye,
your scar?

18:00.180 --> 18:02.649
I, um, hit my head
when I was a kid.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.751
On purpose?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.954
No, I have epilepsy.
I had a fit.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.522
That was a joke!

18:10.723 --> 18:12.225
I'm scarred.

18:12.359 --> 18:17.029
Mum went totally psycho
and pushed me into a door.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.798
Now my chin's uneven.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.186
NADIA: Turn that off!
I can't hear.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.188
DAMIEN: Well,
bloody turn your telly up!

18:41.288 --> 18:43.690
Whatever.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.628
Hey, how come
nobody's used that cabin

18:48.728 --> 18:50.463
the whole time
we've been coming?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.699
It's one of the ghost cabins.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.504
Were you here then,
when that boy drowned?

19:00.707 --> 19:03.243
- Were you?
- No.

19:03.376 --> 19:07.314
The rumor is, the kid who
did it lived in your cabin.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.321
The kid who died
was my brother.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.922
Shit.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.658
Sorry.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.129
We come and look sometimes.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.343
This is a good one,
it's a good one.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.711
- He can go first.
- Oh, passing! Well.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.580
OK. Um...

19:40.713 --> 19:42.982
- She's confident.
- Ten diamonds.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.318
JAMES: No, it's a black card.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.054
- OK.
- Four spades.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.922
- No, it's a club.
- Oh.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.159
- Ten clubs.
JAMES: Lower than ten clubs.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.528
Um, six clubs.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.196
Higher than six clubs.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.032
- Eight clubs.
- Lower than eight clubs.

OK!

It's going to be like that?

20:47.380 --> 20:48.881
You approached me.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.887
You know
you'll get recognized?

20:54.987 --> 20:57.490
I don't look ten anymore.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.426
I knew you straight off.

You would.

This is our cabin.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.956
Yeah,
but you're within the radius.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.927

trying to find him, like her?

Yeah, right.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.379
Yeah, good boy, hm?

21:56.449 --> 21:58.084
You still killed him.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.887
Fuck off.

22:01.954 --> 22:06.092
You know, I've seen her around
a couple times, his mum.

22:06.225 --> 22:09.195
Yeah. She, um,
she's got two new girls.

22:12.599 --> 22:17.437
I don't know where she got
that mutilation bullshit from.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.173
But I wouldn't feel sorry
for her if I was you,

shit she was saying about you.

22:34.253 --> 22:35.888
You think I moved him?

22:39.792 --> 22:42.962
No. I didn't need to.

You should have just shut up,

(More dogs begin barking)

23:17.229 --> 23:20.166
Oh, yeah. They get closer now.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.439
They scrounge around the park.

23:26.573 --> 23:30.309
This little girl got bit
on the face the other day.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.944
Yeah.

23:36.483 --> 23:39.952
You know, my theory is that
a wild dog came down

23:40.086 --> 23:41.954
and took him from the river.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.591
'Cause didn't something
come up in your trial

23:44.724 --> 23:46.826
about drag marks in the bush?

23:51.464 --> 23:53.900
I mean,
you know better than me.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.738
(Laughs)

24:00.439 --> 24:01.574
Alright!

24:16.689 --> 24:20.893
Yeah, it's not a safe river,
you know?

24:20.993 --> 24:26.165
It's like quicksand
all up and down it.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.701
You could be standing there
one minute,

24:28.801 --> 24:30.302
and then the next,

24:30.436 --> 24:33.740
you know, just gone.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.775
- That's bullshit.
- No.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.877
People drown all the time.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.620
Last year,
my dad and I went to Sydney.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.592
We were drinking on the beach,

24:52.692 --> 24:59.098
and he went off for a piss
and found a dead baby.

24:59.231 --> 25:03.235
Like, someone had drowned
their own kid.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.038
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.576
Next day,
everyone just went swimming

25:09.709 --> 25:11.778
like nothing had happened.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.549
Did you see it?

25:17.550 --> 25:21.053
Yeah - shriveled and blue.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.533
You want to come back
to my place?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.036
What, now?

25:37.169 --> 25:39.939
Yeah.
I just live up the mountain.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.441
I don't live in the park.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.076
You live on the mountain road?

25:44.210 --> 25:47.880
Mm-hm. In a proper house...

25:49.749 --> 25:51.250
..all to myself.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.056
The kid next door
is looking for you.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.192
For me?

26:07.433 --> 26:10.670
This girl came down the river
before.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.541
She had a massive fight
with her friend,

26:15.675 --> 26:17.777
so she was a bit pissy, right?

26:17.910 --> 26:21.614
So I went swimming with her
to cheer her up.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.449
We smoked a bit of weed.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.587
Next thing,
she's ripping my gear off,

26:28.721 --> 26:32.792
saying weed made her horny.

26:32.892 --> 26:37.063
She's licking my neck,
letting me suck on her tits.

26:39.699 --> 26:43.402
She tells me to lie down
so she can get on top of me.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.775
By this point, I'm, like,
hard as fuck.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.477
She's got hands
down my shorts...

26:52.812 --> 26:56.816
..telling me I had the nicest
cock she'd ever seen.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.385
She wanted
to give me a blow job.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.989
Then her fucking phone
goes off.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.194
It's her friend, saying,
'Come back.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.798
Sorry.'

27:14.901 --> 27:16.402
(Unzipping)

27:40.893 --> 27:42.394
(Groans)

27:47.900 --> 27:49.401
(Anthony groans)

28:13.860 --> 28:15.862
(Car pulls up)

28:30.877 --> 28:32.378
Honey?

28:33.780 --> 28:35.281
Wake up.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.185
Come on, we're going home now.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.187
Get off me!

28:41.287 --> 28:43.389
- Don't you dare!
- Get out!

28:43.489 --> 28:45.958
Hey! What's...

28:46.092 --> 28:49.061
I frightened him.
This is what I mean, hm?

28:49.195 --> 28:50.963
WAYNE:
He can't behave like that.

28:51.097 --> 28:54.901
PAIGE: We're trying to
help him. Wayne, you just go.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.403
- We'll get the bus tomorrow.
- You're kidding me?

28:57.536 --> 29:02.408
I'm not leaving you, Paige.
I'm not leaving you with him.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.076
Come on.

29:28.868 --> 29:32.771
DAMIEN: Hey, your mountain
road friend was around.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.573
JAMES:
How did you know it was him?

29:34.706 --> 29:39.445
Brown-haired kid, said
he lived on the mountain road.

29:39.578 --> 29:41.747
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.616
- Didn't you see him?
- What did he say?

29:44.750 --> 29:46.785
- Why?
- Don't talk to him.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.720
I'm not kidding - don't.

29:57.363 --> 29:59.065
PAIGE:
Wayne doesn't know about you,

29:59.198 --> 30:00.867
so you need to stay quiet
about that.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.568
What are you doing here
anyway?

30:02.701 --> 30:05.271
You're not supposed to be
within five kilometers of him.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.174
You know that.
You're coming back with us.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.721
What do you know about dogs
up here, wild dogs?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.892
There was some dog problem
at some point.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.559
I think a dog
might have taken him.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.195
Who?

30:37.169 --> 30:38.670
Honey!

30:42.975 --> 30:44.576
The police looked.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.212
It happens...

30:47.313 --> 30:49.781
..dogs taking lambs, chickens.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.417
Why not a kid?

30:54.653 --> 30:57.389
Is that really
what you've come for?

30:58.390 --> 31:00.960
There's a woman
I want to ask about it.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.796
(Dog barks)

31:11.403 --> 31:13.705
(More dogs start to bark)
(Woman whistles)

31:16.875 --> 31:18.377
Hey!

31:18.477 --> 31:20.913
- Hey!
- You selling something?

31:22.681 --> 31:24.583
- No.
- What do you want?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.318
I just wanted to ask...

31:26.452 --> 31:28.820
If you ask
if I have God in my life, son,

31:28.921 --> 31:31.357
you're about to find out.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.260
No. I just wanted to ask you
some stuff.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.695
Please. It would only take
two seconds.

31:36.795 --> 31:40.466
Well. Haven't you
the nicest manners?

31:40.599 --> 31:42.368
Do you feed the wild ones?

31:42.468 --> 31:44.870
Feed them? Mate, I kill them.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.772
But I thought you love dogs.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.909
Not those dogs.
They don't need food.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.678
I remember her.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.280
She rides in the front seat

31:54.413 --> 31:56.448
while the other two
ride in the tray.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.117
You must be thinking of Susie.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.219
- Oh, yeah?
- He's her pup.

32:00.319 --> 32:05.524
Got a different nature to her,
normally - not as trusting.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.159
She was a good dog.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.468
Do you think a wild dog
took that boy from the river?

32:16.602 --> 32:18.971
Son, you ever see dogs
kill a sheep?

32:19.105 --> 32:23.309
They don't kill for food
so much as fun - tear them up.

32:23.442 --> 32:26.412
Let's say for a second
they got that boy's body.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.614
There would have been
bits of him everywhere.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.616
How do you kill them?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.453
Traps all around here.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.423
They like hanging out here
a little too much.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.525
Even deep-burying the bastards

32:39.658 --> 32:41.960
won't stop them
sniffing around.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.796
They'd eat their own young.

32:44.930 --> 32:47.766
Do the police know about this?

32:47.899 --> 32:50.702
You'd have to be cunning to
think of getting him in there.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.473
- Boys, wasn't it?
- Who else knows about this?

32:54.606 --> 32:57.909
- Just me and a farmer friend.
- No-one else?

32:58.044 --> 33:00.446
They missed that boy when
they searched the river.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.081
Half-done job.

33:03.182 --> 33:07.086
All kinds of dead trees
and old machinery in there.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.289
Little thing
was probably stuck under one.

33:10.422 --> 33:14.260
You know, six months of water
rushing by, he's all gone -

33:14.393 --> 33:17.729
a bunch of bones
swept out to sea.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.665
How many are down there?

33:19.765 --> 33:22.468
We would have got
30 or 40 between us.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.371
We've got problem dogs
rather than big packs.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.972
Damo.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.177
He's got epilepsy.

33:31.277 --> 33:34.280
- You're right.
- Son...

33:34.413 --> 33:37.683
- Look at me. You're alright.
- James...

33:37.783 --> 33:39.385
MARY: Come on.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.952
Come on!

33:53.565 --> 33:56.368
MARY:
Funny, you bringing up Susie.

33:56.468 --> 34:00.739
You know she ran off on me,
or so I thought.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.676
This one day, a boy turns up,
bawling his eyes out,

34:04.776 --> 34:07.379
sorry for
what they'd done to her.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.916
Only a coward
kills a dog like that.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.551
JAMES: Who was he?

34:22.293 --> 34:24.163
They said
you weren't coming back here.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.699
Ray, that woman with the dogs,

34:27.799 --> 34:30.702
she said two boys
killed a dog of hers.

34:30.802 --> 34:33.772
One came back and apologized.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.706
Ray, I know that was you.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.312
- I'm not meant to get upset.
- Then don't.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.982
It was Anthony, wasn't it?

34:44.116 --> 34:46.818
You have no idea
how much I hate him.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.656
What happened between you two?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.058
You know. Everyone knows.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.793
Tell me.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.933
Ask!

35:04.102 --> 35:06.037
Why'd you cut your dick off,
Ray?

35:06.172 --> 35:08.307
Why'd you cut it off, Ray?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.576
I don't care. I don't care!

35:10.709 --> 35:12.211
You should care.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.681
- You should care.
- OK, OK.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.283
OK. I care.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.917
I care.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.734
(Winces)

35:35.867 --> 35:37.369
It's OK.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.776
You love your sister,
don't you?

35:44.910 --> 35:47.078
Yeah.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.681
She means a lot to you.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.283
Yeah.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.022
You should write her name
here.

35:58.890 --> 36:02.294
Next time you try to cut,
you won't be able to.

36:07.233 --> 36:11.603
Ray, wherever that dog is,
it's really important to me.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.743
He'll get me.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.378
I won't let him.

36:30.456 --> 36:31.957
RAY: It was easy.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.595
We just called out to her
and she chased us.

36:37.729 --> 36:40.866
We didn't want
to get seen with her,

36:40.966 --> 36:43.101
so we took her up the river...

36:45.737 --> 36:47.239
..up to the bridge.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.810
Do you know you can get in?

36:51.943 --> 36:55.547
The safety grille was
taken off a long time ago.

36:57.383 --> 37:00.386
Road guys go in
to check the bridge is safe.

37:00.519 --> 37:03.855
The kids smoke bongs in there,
mess around.

37:07.158 --> 37:11.096
There are holes in the floor
where the pylons are,

37:11.229 --> 37:13.599
and they go all the way
down...

37:15.100 --> 37:17.403
..down into the river.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.771
We were just playing with her.

37:20.772 --> 37:24.476
He had something
in his hand she was chasing,

37:24.610 --> 37:26.545
and he just dropped it...

37:27.546 --> 37:29.247
..right down the hole.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.067
What did you do to Ray Lewis?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.702
(Laughs)

37:54.973 --> 37:56.475
Ray Lewis...

37:59.545 --> 38:01.046
Ray Lewis is a joke.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.951
Do you think that finding him

38:06.084 --> 38:08.887
is going to make everyone
love you?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.522
'Cause it just...

38:10.656 --> 38:13.559
It looks like
you've lied about it

38:13.692 --> 38:17.262
and you've made life
even more shit for his mum.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.733
You think I'm being a cunt
right now,

38:21.867 --> 38:24.570
but I'm just telling you
the truth.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.910
I don't want that for you,
James.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.745
Don't talk like that.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.547
Like what?

38:35.681 --> 38:37.315
Like we're mates.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.285
Well, we were mates.
We were fucking good mates.

38:40.419 --> 38:43.689
Yeah,
but then you dumped me in it.

38:43.789 --> 38:47.459
Man, I said what they wanted
to hear so I could go home.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.195
OK? I was a kid.

38:50.295 --> 38:53.365
I said you panicked,
and that's it. Nothing else.

38:53.465 --> 38:57.436
Didn't say you were a bad kid,
OK? Nothing like that.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.538
I didn't mention you at all.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.474
I know. Your mum did.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.209
I know that.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.978
- You went back down there.
- I never moved him.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.614
Bullshit.

39:09.581 --> 39:13.652
Fuck, mate! What do you want
me to tell you, huh?

39:13.752 --> 39:15.687
I will fucking choke you!

39:17.556 --> 39:19.425
I was with you.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.927
The whole time,
I was with you.

39:24.563 --> 39:29.234
After the fit, until
the ambulance took you away.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.439
I even got your fucking mum.
Don't you remember?

39:33.572 --> 39:36.374
So when can I have
fucking moved him?

39:36.475 --> 39:37.976
(Gate creaks open)

39:40.111 --> 39:41.613
It's my dad.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.385
Tell me the truth.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.020
I am.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.731
(Gasps)

40:37.102 --> 40:39.270
(Both laugh)

40:39.304 --> 40:40.806
I'm drowning!

40:40.939 --> 40:44.643
(Car doors open and shut,
people talk and laugh)

40:58.089 --> 40:59.591
WOMAN: Come here!

40:59.725 --> 41:01.927
CHILD: What?
- Put that stick down!

41:02.060 --> 41:04.930
How many times
do I have to tell you? No!

41:05.063 --> 41:06.965
- Ow!
- Don't go in there!

41:07.098 --> 41:08.934
I told you no!

41:09.067 --> 41:11.136
Listen to me - get in the car!

41:14.606 --> 41:18.176
That boy's going to grow up
terrified of her.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.947
You have to walk in someone
else's shoes for a bit.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.749
Yeah. I suppose every parent's

41:23.849 --> 41:25.817
got their own ideas,
don't they?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.754
(Laughs) Like I'd know!

41:29.721 --> 41:33.592
I didn't mean that, Paige.
I didn't mean,

41:33.725 --> 41:37.629
because you don't have kids,
you don't understand.

41:41.399 --> 41:42.901
A boy drowned here.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.172
That's what that was about.

41:47.305 --> 41:50.576
That's why she hit him,
because

41:50.676 --> 41:53.945
down there's where that boy
went missing.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.284
I didn't know that.

41:59.417 --> 42:02.353
So she's scared,
so that's on her mind.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.293
I lost my boy...

42:12.898 --> 42:17.235
..and this place
just reminds me...

42:20.572 --> 42:22.641
..way too much of that time.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.125
You're James's mum.

43:17.763 --> 43:19.264
Have you met him?

43:19.397 --> 43:21.399
Have you been swimming?

43:21.532 --> 43:23.635
Seemed like a good day for it.

43:42.921 --> 43:44.422
Anthony!

43:46.524 --> 43:48.927
- How are you doing, Mrs L?
- Have you seen James?

43:49.060 --> 43:50.796
Yeah, sure have.

43:50.929 --> 43:53.732
What are you going to say
about that?

43:54.766 --> 43:56.634
I don't know yet.

43:56.768 --> 43:59.838
He hasn't come back for you,

43:59.971 --> 44:02.573
he just needs
to put some things at rest.

44:02.674 --> 44:05.243
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.646
Where is he?

44:12.617 --> 44:14.786
I don't know.

44:16.822 --> 44:19.390
You keep letting him fuck up,
eh?

44:19.524 --> 44:22.093
- He's not fucking up.
- Well...

44:22.227 --> 44:25.296
..you led him straight
into prison the first time,

44:25.430 --> 44:27.165
and you're doing it again.

44:27.298 --> 44:30.736
Getting him to speak
to the police was right.

44:30.836 --> 44:34.806
Yeah.
Look where it got everyone.

44:34.940 --> 44:37.976
Look, I know
we don't like each other...

44:38.109 --> 44:41.612
- I like you a lot.
- ..but do not punish him

44:41.747 --> 44:43.248
to get back at me.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.784
What would I
get back at you for?

44:45.917 --> 44:49.487
You had a hunch about me,
it was wrong. No sweat.

44:51.723 --> 44:53.624
Why wouldn't you like me?

44:55.593 --> 44:57.128
I was nine years old.

44:59.664 --> 45:01.599
What was so wrong with me?

45:05.070 --> 45:06.772
That's past, Anthony.

45:06.905 --> 45:08.974
You're right, that is past.

45:09.107 --> 45:12.043
How are you two getting along,
by the way?

45:12.143 --> 45:13.812
- Pretty good.
- Funny.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.680
You never even wanted him.

45:16.848 --> 45:18.349
Fucking rubbish!

45:18.483 --> 45:20.819
You were fucking pissed
out of your brain one night,

45:20.952 --> 45:22.453
and we heard you say

45:22.553 --> 45:24.422
how much having a kid
ruined everything.

45:25.791 --> 45:29.127
It was more than a hunch,
you fucking little shit!

45:29.260 --> 45:31.429
He's still lying for you.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.665
What is it? What is it?

45:37.302 --> 45:40.671
Slap a kid. That's nice.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.310
It was good seeing you.

46:13.738 --> 46:16.641
(Laughs)
Look how skinny I was.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.944
You should put it on.

46:19.077 --> 46:21.679
(Laughs)
You've got to be kidding!

46:21.813 --> 46:23.348
Wayne would like it.

46:27.185 --> 46:28.686
Good grief!

46:30.788 --> 46:33.058
He's a good guy.

46:33.158 --> 46:35.827
Yeah, he is.

46:37.963 --> 46:39.464
(Shower runs)

46:39.597 --> 46:42.033
JAMES: That last day,
when I had my fit,

46:42.133 --> 46:43.634
how did you find me?

46:45.536 --> 46:47.638
PAIGE: Anthony.

46:47.772 --> 46:50.909
He came and got me
and we carried you back.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.845
JAMES: Then he went home?
PAIGE: No, he stayed.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.447
He was crying so much,
it annoyed me.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.917
It was like he was trying
to pull attention from you.

46:59.050 --> 47:01.619
I just kept telling him
to go home.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.559
JAMES:
I just had a partial seizure.

47:08.659 --> 47:12.230
PAIGE: You still get them?
JAMES: Sometimes.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.831
PAIGE: Lie down.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.235
I'm OK.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.171
You don't owe that woman.

47:20.305 --> 47:22.840
The police owed it to her
to find that boy, they didn't.

47:22.974 --> 47:25.343
It's not your responsibility.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.445
Plus, the things she said!

47:28.746 --> 47:32.050
She called me,
'that bitch in the make-up'.

47:34.953 --> 47:37.255
How long was I down there,

47:37.355 --> 47:41.259
between me having the fit
and you finding me?

47:41.392 --> 47:44.795
Well, you'd been gone all day.
I don't know.

47:44.930 --> 47:47.966
I don't know.
You were still on the ground.

47:48.099 --> 47:51.402
- 20 minutes, maybe.
- It's not long enough.

47:52.837 --> 47:54.405
He just wouldn't go.

47:55.540 --> 47:58.443
It was like
he was glued to you.

47:58.576 --> 48:02.447
I kept saying, 'Go home,'
but he just wouldn't.

48:02.580 --> 48:04.082
Always glued to you.

48:05.816 --> 48:07.452
JAMES:
He couldn't have moved him.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.454
PAIGE: Honey, he's gone.

48:09.554 --> 48:13.758
They missed him, and you're
not going to find him now.

49:14.352 --> 49:17.122
(Bottles clink,
fridge door shuts)

49:24.795 --> 49:26.731
- Cheers, bud.
- Cheers.

49:33.171 --> 49:35.040
So you're a truckie?

49:35.140 --> 49:36.641
Yeah.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.278
I'm thinking
I might like that.

49:40.411 --> 49:42.947
You got your license yet?

49:43.081 --> 49:44.582
No.

49:45.583 --> 49:48.353
(Laughs)
Maybe start with that, eh?

49:48.486 --> 49:50.155
You keep on with those beers,

49:50.255 --> 49:52.657
you'll start
looking like a truckie.

49:52.790 --> 49:55.326
Oi!
What's a truckie look like?

49:55.460 --> 49:56.961
No comment.

50:01.432 --> 50:05.470
We could head out
on the river, do some fishing.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.572
What do you get up here?

50:07.672 --> 50:09.174
Barra, yabbies.

50:11.276 --> 50:13.111
I think your aunt wants to go.

50:13.244 --> 50:15.646
We could head out and
get something for a fry-up.

50:15.780 --> 50:18.649
WAYNE: That actually sounds
bloody good.

50:18.783 --> 50:21.319
There's those old rods
in there.

50:24.789 --> 50:26.324
How far would you go?

50:28.059 --> 50:31.529
JAMES: Up to the bridge.
PAIGE: That far?

50:31.629 --> 50:35.100
It's the best spot.
Damo's dad's got a tinnie.

50:35.233 --> 50:39.170
PAIGE: Who's Damo?
JAMES: Kid next door.

50:39.304 --> 50:41.739
His dad takes him out
every day.

50:43.274 --> 50:45.176
WAYNE: Let's go fishing.

51:42.533 --> 51:48.072
(Deep breathing)

52:04.289 --> 52:06.023
Thanks. Thanks, mate.

52:06.123 --> 52:09.460
I'm going to disappear
for a minute. Stay here.

52:09.594 --> 52:11.396
See you guys in a minute.

54:57.395 --> 54:59.096
(Empty bottles clank)

55:04.969 --> 55:07.104
(Crunches through rubbish)

55:22.052 --> 55:23.554
(Grunts)

55:25.456 --> 55:27.024
(Breathes heavily)

55:55.586 --> 55:57.688
Oh, look at that!

55:57.822 --> 56:00.458
Bit of mud on them.
See that, Wayne?

56:00.558 --> 56:03.828
- See how blue they are?
- Nice one, mate.

56:03.961 --> 56:06.564
They go bright pink
on the barbie.

56:21.612 --> 56:23.748
You got brothers and sisters?

56:23.848 --> 56:25.082
No.

56:25.182 --> 56:26.951
Funny what you find
on the internet.

56:27.084 --> 56:29.620
Just reading about
Chris McCarthy's two sisters.

56:29.754 --> 56:31.255
No brother.

56:54.979 --> 56:58.048
I don't want you
around my sister.

56:58.148 --> 56:59.650
What?

57:11.662 --> 57:13.163
CLIVE: What's wrong, buddy?

57:14.532 --> 57:16.033
Cold, Dad.

57:32.416 --> 57:34.685
WAYNE: Hey, James!

57:35.820 --> 57:38.689
Bloody trove here, mate,
look at this.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.290
James?

57:40.424 --> 57:43.027
(Wayne's voice
becomes muffled)

57:43.127 --> 57:45.730
James! James!

57:47.765 --> 57:49.266
(Gasps and coughs)

58:05.282 --> 58:08.553
Give us a hand!
Grab him!

58:08.653 --> 58:11.622
Bring him up. Bring him up!

58:30.274 --> 58:31.441
DAMIEN: You killed him,

58:31.576 --> 58:33.410
and then you said
you're his brother.

58:33.544 --> 58:35.045
That's the sick part.

58:35.145 --> 58:37.181
JAMES: I couldn't tell you
anything, man.

58:37.314 --> 58:39.584
Well, lie differently.
I felt sorry for you.

58:39.684 --> 58:41.185
Now, when I look at you,

58:41.318 --> 58:43.487
all I see is what you did
to that fucking kid!

58:43.621 --> 58:45.355
- So do I.
- How you covered him in mud,

58:45.489 --> 58:48.425
in his face, in his eyes, to
make him look like a troll.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.828
And then you pissed on him.

58:50.961 --> 58:53.664
You threw rocks at him
and you shoved sticks in him.

58:53.798 --> 58:55.933
Those stories are bullshit!

58:58.035 --> 59:00.905
They made me sound horrible,
like a devil.

59:02.439 --> 59:06.043
They made me sound like
I don't care about life.

59:33.270 --> 59:35.039
It's Anthony, isn't it?

59:37.441 --> 59:40.544
Is your mate
getting involved with him?

59:40.678 --> 59:42.512
What do you care?

59:42.647 --> 59:46.383
I went to school with
his brother. Do you know Joe?

59:52.589 --> 59:55.425
I'm going to be straight up
with you.

59:55.525 --> 59:57.027
Really?

59:58.462 --> 01:00:02.499
You know the kid who drowned
in the river, Chris McCarthy?

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:04.134
I killed him.

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:08.873
Come in.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:13.678
I used to just fuck him...

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.547
..now I pay him.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:23.487
Whatever he wants, I pay him.

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:25.455
He needs money a lot.

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:27.491
Why?

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.593
He doesn't work.

01:00:29.727 --> 01:00:32.763
His dad's a deadbeat
and his mum's gone.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:38.102
For a while, he got Ray Lewis
to do webcam shows for money,

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:41.238
until that all went weird.
(Laughs)

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:43.340
(Barks)

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.975
Bear!

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:52.549
Ah, is Anthony here?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.787
No. He's not far off.

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.725
Come in.

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:04.862
JAMES: Why do you pay him?
AMOS: I don't know.

01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:09.633
He's the biggest
fucking monster.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.109
(Espresso machine hisses)

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.648
AMOS: You know
he got Ray to cut off his dick

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:26.283
so it looked more like a cunt?

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:27.885
You want a drink?

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.653
I'm alright, thanks.

01:01:30.955 --> 01:01:32.489
AMOS: I feel sorry for him.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.293
He hates himself so much.

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:39.096
Why did you ask me
about his brothers?

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:40.998
To see how much you knew.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:03.620
So you killed that kid, huh?

01:02:13.998 --> 01:02:15.499
So it goes.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:19.336
Mario,

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.438
Joe,

01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:23.473
Anthony,

01:02:23.607 --> 01:02:25.109
Bettina.

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:28.645
AMOS: Wogs always
have a shitload of kids, eh?

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:30.480
How do you know Anthony,
from school?

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:32.449
I know him from the park.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.385
AMOS: I always thought
it was weird

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:38.122
Anthony didn't go with his mum
in the divorce.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:41.425
Joe went.
Mario had already left.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:43.027
Anyway, he didn't.

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:47.731
So I'm friends with Joe
online,

01:02:47.832 --> 01:02:49.934
and I'm seeing
all of his photos.

01:02:50.034 --> 01:02:53.537
There's photos of Joe and some
of Mario and some of the mum,

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.239
but none of Bettina.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.275
And I can't figure it out.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:03.313
AMOS: So I'm thinking,
'Where is she?'

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.149
Is it just you two here?

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:08.485
Living here? Yeah.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.620
AMOS: And I ask Joe...
- Just me and Anthony.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.223
AMOS: ..and Joe
just doesn't respond.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:17.461
The others, they, uh,
live with their mum.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:19.964
AMOS:
Joe doesn't respond at all.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.598
Joe's here sometimes.

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:24.801
AMOS: So I figure she must
still be with the dad.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.139
Around that time, I started
hooking up with Anthony,

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:31.876
and pretty soon,
I'm always at the house.

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:35.379
And I'm thinking,
'Where's Bettina?'

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:39.884
So I ask Anthony,
and he weirds out.

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.153
DAMIEN: Did you once find
a dead baby?

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:46.623
Anthony said you found
a dead baby at the beach.

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:49.493
Someone had drowned it,
their own kid.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:54.498
The shit that
comes out of that kid's mouth.

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.133
Oh. He made it up?

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.370
AMOS: And then Joe rocks up
one night,

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.006
beats the shit out of me,

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.508
and says if I don't shut
the fuck up about Bettina,

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:07.344
he's going to call the police
on me.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:09.980
And say what?

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:18.122
That I started fucking Anthony
when he was 14.

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:27.831
Should I just, um,
wait in his room?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.369
Yeah, if you want.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:34.171
Is it just...

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.873
- First one on your left.
- Thanks.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:41.011
JAMES: So where is she?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.382
AMOS: You're not listening.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:49.153
That family has a secret,
something rotten.

01:04:52.923 --> 01:04:55.492
That little girl's
gone missing.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.861
They don't talk about it.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:00.430
Nobody talks about it.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:04.134
The kid you killed,
people don't shut up about.

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.806
JAMES: So say something.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.541
AMOS: It's not for me.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.811
He's down the river.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.446
I'll drop you.

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:23.553
AMOS: So you killed that kid,
you held him down?

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:26.356
Who suggested
going down river?

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.625
Whose idea was the drowning?

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:33.463
Whose idea was taking the kid
in the first place?

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:37.867
(Starts engine)

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:33.990
PAIGE: So he's
a fucking epileptic!

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:35.792
WAYNE:
You should have told me that.

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.994
He was in the middle
of the river by himself!

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:41.098
PAIGE: I didn't know
he still had them.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:47.937
WAYNE: What are they?

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:50.807
PAIGE: Don't worry about it.
WAYNE: You don't need those.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.178
PAIGE: Don't you tell me what
I do and don't need, Wayne.

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:55.812
WAYNE: I can't work you out.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.447
PAIGE:
What can't you work out?

01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:59.349
WAYNE: Why can't you say it?
- Say what?

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.017
Say that
he's your fucking son!

01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:03.487
Say whatever it is you're
going through, he's had a fit

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:06.256
in the middle
of the fucking river!

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.025
You're his mother.

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:12.096
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:14.364
What's that supposed to mean?

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.933
Trying to
hold onto some things.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:20.337
Some useless attempt
to get something back.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.840
Jesus, Wayne! I know
you're a fucking truck driver,

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.376
but are you
that fucking thick?

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.781
(Paige pours a glass of wine)

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:36.320
I spend too much time

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.123
imagining it
the other way around -

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:43.760
pretending that
her boy killed mine,

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.829
just so I can have
someone else to hate

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:47.464
other than myself.

01:07:57.141 --> 01:07:58.642
(Door opens)

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.112
I killed someone.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.982
She's just used to lying
about it.

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:10.254
It's not your fault, mate.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:13.290
Sorry to leave you stranded.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.924
We're not stranded.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:19.328
My brother went to prison,
mate.

01:08:21.265 --> 01:08:25.269
I don't pretend
to know what it's like, but...

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:28.505
He used to say, people think
you go in, you get punished,

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:30.939
you come out.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.477
That's not
the real punishment.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.145
That comes after...

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.549
..when you have to convince
yourself and everyone else

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:42.486
that you're still
worth something.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:46.790
Don't you let any bastard
tell you that

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.024
you don't deserve anything.

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:55.131
(Sighs)

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.009
(Wayne drives away)

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:16.953
(Dog barks)

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.596
Hey!

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:33.370
What have you been saying
about your sister?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.004
What sister?

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.450
JAMES: I'm sorry, Mum.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.818
I said I never lied...

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:54.358
..but I did.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.470
The police asked
if there was a plan.

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:13.343
I said it was just random.

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:19.749
Chris was just
wandering lost or something.

01:10:24.821 --> 01:10:26.323
No, he wasn't.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.728
There was a plan.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.737
Anthony...

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:45.675
..said he wanted
a little sister...

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.315
..asked me to steal him one...

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.384
..if I would do that.

01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:57.321
And then we saw Chris...

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:04.160
..and Anthony goes,
'He'll do.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.097
Get him.'

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.336
We were just playing.

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:19.108
I never knew
it was going to end like that.

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:31.888
One minute,
we're having fun...

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.661
..and the next,
he starts screaming...

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.931
..screaming right in my face.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:52.008
And Anthony goes,
'You stole him. You did it.

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:55.979
And you're going to
get locked up now.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.850
You're going to have to
do something about it.'

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:08.592
If I had just said
there was a plan...

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.130
..they would have asked
more questions...

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:19.803
..like, why would Anthony want
a little sister

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:21.738
when he already has one?

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.511
His brother came.

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:29.646
He came looking for him.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:31.280
Your dad and I,

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.783
we were waiting with you
for the ambulance,

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:36.686
and that's when
he stepped outside.

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:40.023
He stepped outside
to talk to his brother.

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:49.332
Why was he screaming?

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.772
I don't know if I should say,

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.674
after all this time.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.616
Did he hurt him?

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:16.159
If I say yes,
will that help her?

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.437
If it was me, it would.

01:15:00.664 --> 01:15:02.165
My brother Joe.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:34.230
(Joe spits phlegm)

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:30.353
JOE: My brother said you're
looking for the dead kid.

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:33.890
He told you what happened -
some dogs got him.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:40.997
We can show you where he is,
but you've got to choose.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:46.402
We know you've got a new mate,

01:16:46.502 --> 01:16:48.938
the little poofter
at the park.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.742
If you choose the dead kid...

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:57.146
..we'll beat the shit
out of your mate.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.782
So which is it...

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.852
..kid or faggot?

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:07.056
- Kid.
- Huh?

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:10.259
The kid.

01:17:10.393 --> 01:17:11.928
(Joe starts engine)

01:17:22.906 --> 01:17:25.942
(Engine stops,
two doors shut)

01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:46.763
Nah.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.498
Further.

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.648
OK.

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:08.584
What are you doing?
You chose the kid. Start.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.153
Another time.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:16.926
You think
you're smarter than us.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.661
Man, you're dog shit.

01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:22.732
You didn't know we had him
already, did you?

01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:25.769
You thought you'd get to him
faster than us.

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:30.373
His, uh... his mum has been
looking for him too.

01:18:30.473 --> 01:18:31.975
She keeps ringing.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.450
(Joe spits)

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:44.988
Dog shit, huh?

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:48.858
How deep is he?

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:50.459
You'll see.

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:53.462
Must be real deep.

01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:01.670
(Whistles)

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.240
(Car door opens)

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.246
No, no, no.

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:13.883
(Opens the boot)

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.422
(Faint moaning)

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.359
What the fuck?!

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:35.404
Bitch!

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:42.278
We won't be seeing you again,
will we?

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.684
Would you rather suck an arse
or fuck an arse,

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:51.720
you fucking faggot, hm?

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.115
Hey...

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:22.318
..he didn't choose you.

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:20.136
What card am I thinking of?

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:27.476
JAMES: The seven of diamonds?

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.013
DAMIEN: It's a diamond.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:34.417
JAMES: Queen of diamonds?

01:22:34.517 --> 01:22:36.452
DAMIEN: It's not a royal.

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:41.357
JAMES: Two of diamonds?

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.426
DAMIEN: It's higher than two.

01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:49.165
JAMES: Four of diamonds?

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:52.101
(Damien laughs softly)

01:22:57.873 --> 01:22:59.375
DAMIEN: Bingo.

01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:05.681
- (Grunts)
ANTHONY: Dad!

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:10.819
JAMES: You cunt!
(Anthony screams)

01:23:15.124 --> 01:23:17.126
Hey! Get off!

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.162
Get off him!

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:20.796
Get off him!

01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:26.102
What the fuck? Whoa!

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:27.736
Get out!

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.505
Come back for more,
you little cunt?

01:23:29.638 --> 01:23:31.440
You stay away from
this family, hear me?

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:34.443
- (Spits)
GIANNI: Get rid of him, Joe!

01:23:34.577 --> 01:23:35.944
Fuck off!

01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:38.114
Only if he hits you first!

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:40.416
You're so fucking tough,
aren't you?

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:42.085
- Fuck off!
GIANNI: Joe!

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:44.087
- You would, wouldn't you?
GIANNI: Joe!

01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:45.888
I said, fuck off. Fuck off!

01:23:45.988 --> 01:23:48.091
You're fucking done,
and your fucking dad

01:23:48.224 --> 01:23:50.593
and your fucking brother. Huh?

01:23:51.594 --> 01:23:53.562
- Cops'll come for you.
- For me?

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:55.364
Fucking cops'll come for you,
cunt!

01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:56.599
We'll see about that.

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:58.634
They'll be knocking
on your fucking door

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:00.403
before they come knocking
on mine.

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:04.006
What? What are you gonna do?
Fuck off! (Spits)

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.142
What? Fucking what?!

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:11.514
Cunt.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:13.516
You alright, huh?

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:24.460
How long's he been here,
Anthony?

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:26.862
A day.

01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:29.732
- What?
- He's only been here a day.

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:31.934
I was going to tell you!

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.437
I swear
I was going to tell you!

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.141
(Anthony screams and cries)

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:48.451
(Mobile buzzes)

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.429
Hello?

01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:02.064
Paige? It's Rita.

01:25:03.466 --> 01:25:04.967
Are you with James?

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:09.938
Yes.

01:25:10.072 --> 01:25:11.907
I've been trying
to get a hold of him.

01:25:12.007 --> 01:25:15.444
He hasn't checked in with me.
He needs to do that every day.

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:16.945
OK.

01:25:17.079 --> 01:25:18.947
He's been with you
these last two nights?

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:20.082
Yeah.

01:25:20.183 --> 01:25:21.684
If he's not going to
stay at home,

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:23.519
he needs to indicate
he's with you,

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.188
otherwise
it's a break of curfew.

01:25:25.288 --> 01:25:28.424
Disregard for curfew is
another breach.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.262
Is something going on?

01:25:33.396 --> 01:25:34.997
I was just, ah,

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.567
thinking last night what a
good job you'd done with him.

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:40.269
Right.

01:25:40.403 --> 01:25:43.239
Where is he, Paige?
I need to speak to him.

01:25:43.372 --> 01:25:45.274
PAIGE:
I think you'll forgive him

01:25:45.408 --> 01:25:48.110
your fucking,
bullshit breaches.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:53.316
Hey, beautiful!

01:25:53.449 --> 01:25:56.419
Hey. Hey, how are you, huh?

01:25:56.519 --> 01:25:59.822
How are you doing,
how are you doing?

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:02.291
You're so beautiful,
aren't you?

01:27:20.503 --> 01:27:23.238
(Dripping water)

01:27:58.441 --> 01:28:00.876
(Approaching footsteps)

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:25.454
(Gasps)

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:13.969
(Cries)

01:31:33.522 --> 01:31:35.023
(Retches)

01:34:50.819 --> 01:34:53.956
* NICK CAVE: The Weeping Song

01:34:59.161 --> 01:35:04.432
* Go, son
Go down to the water

01:35:06.068 --> 01:35:11.439
* And see the women
weeping there

01:35:13.608 --> 01:35:19.381
* Then go up into
the mountains

01:35:20.515 --> 01:35:25.420
* The men,
they are weeping too

01:35:27.956 --> 01:35:32.795
* Father, why are
all the women weeping?

01:35:34.897 --> 01:35:39.567
* They are weeping
for their men

01:35:42.104 --> 01:35:47.442
* Then why are all the men
there weeping?

01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:57.786
* They are weeping
back at them

01:36:01.456 --> 01:36:05.160
* This is a weeping song

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.898
* A song in which to weep

01:36:09.998 --> 01:36:15.103
* While all the men and women
sleep

01:36:15.237 --> 01:36:18.907
* This is a weeping song

01:36:19.007 --> 01:36:23.378
* But I won't be weeping long

01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:33.755
* Father, why are all
the children weeping?

01:36:35.991 --> 01:36:40.462
* They are merely crying, son

01:36:43.065 --> 01:36:48.670
* O, are they merely crying,
Father?

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:58.914
* Yes, true weeping
is yet to come

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:05.487
* This is a weeping song

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:10.893
* A song in which to weep

01:37:10.993 --> 01:37:15.964
* While all
the little children sleep

01:37:16.064 --> 01:37:19.968
* This is a weeping song

01:37:20.102 --> 01:37:23.972
* But I won't be weeping long

01:37:29.277 --> 01:37:34.782
* O, Father, tell me,
are you weeping?

01:37:36.618 --> 01:37:41.756
* Your face seems wet to touch

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:49.264
* O, then I'm so sorry, Father

01:37:50.232 --> 01:37:59.174
* I never thought I hurt you
so much

01:38:02.444 --> 01:38:06.181
* This is a weeping song

01:38:06.314 --> 01:38:11.186
* A song in which to weep

01:38:11.319 --> 01:38:16.291
* While we rock ourselves
to sleep

01:38:16.424 --> 01:38:20.028
* This is a weeping song

01:38:20.128 --> 01:38:23.932
* But I won't be weeping long

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:28.870
* No, I won't be weeping long

01:38:30.572 --> 01:38:34.642
* No, I won't be weeping long

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:43.518
* No, I won't be
weeping long. *
