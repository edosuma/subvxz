You've come here today to seek God's help
to control these desires within you.

Because you understand
it would be wrong to hurt a child.

the lessons we teach could be useful.

05:41.361 --> 05:43.361
Or Jesus will?

05:52.641 --> 05:57.921
If we believe this, we must also believe
that he was the one that made us this way.

Where is he?
Did you take him to hospital, for Christ's sake?

29:09.601 --> 29:11.201
He saw my face.

29:12.281 --> 29:14.241
You think I would take the chance?

29:15.361 --> 29:18.841
You called me to get rid of the boy. It's done.

29:59.921 --> 30:02.281
<i>EMILY: Our son Oliver is five years old.</i>

30:03.121 --> 30:06.961
He loves cars, ice-cream, animals...

30:07.121 --> 30:09.641
Er...foxes, in particular.

30:11.761 --> 30:13.761
He's everything to us.

30:18.481 --> 30:20.481
He's our little boy.

30:26.401 --> 30:30.401
If you have him, we are begging you,
please let him go.

30:31.041 --> 30:34.921
Take him to somewhere safe
and let the police know where he is.

30:37.081 --> 30:41.801
Please bring him home to his family...
who love him.

30:43.561 --> 30:46.361
Please bring him home. Please.

30:47.001 --> 30:49.001
(Sobbing)

31:16.321 --> 31:17.921
JULIEN: Where is he now?

31:22.801 --> 31:24.401
Georges tells me...

31:26.761 --> 31:30.001
...it is not good that I ask those things.

31:30.441 --> 31:32.481
You're a monster!

31:36.601 --> 31:39.841
This cancer is my punishment.

31:44.721 --> 31:47.761
I beg you...please...

31:49.641 --> 31:51.481
Do not tell Sylvie.

31:52.801 --> 31:54.801
I beg you.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.921
Do not punish her...for my sin.

32:04.441 --> 32:06.441
Do not punish her.

32:21.921 --> 32:23.921
Tony!

33:16.601 --> 33:19.001
A team are on their way now to arrest Georges.

33:21.401 --> 33:23.401
I can't believe he was involved.

33:29.001 --> 33:30.521
Laurence, tell me something.

33:30.681 --> 33:34.641
Georges called you earlier
when we went to the Hotel L'Eden.

33:35.401 --> 33:38.281
- What did he want?
- He wanted an update on the case.

34:04.081 --> 34:06.361
- Allô“)?
- (Speaks French)

34:18.321 --> 34:20.321
(Laurence continues in French)

34:26.041 --> 34:28.041
(Birds chirruping)

34:46.001 --> 34:48.001
Tony.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.761
I'm... I'm checking out.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.881
Tell me. What happened?

35:01.561 --> 35:03.721
Did you find out something?

35:10.441 --> 35:12.401
Oliver's dead, Sylvie.

35:14.401 --> 35:16.401
He died not long after he was taken.

35:19.001 --> 35:20.801
<i>Oh...</i>

35:34.001 --> 35:36.001
I'm so sorry.

35:39.161 --> 35:41.161
Alain...

35:57.001 --> 35:59.001
Say goodbye to Alain for me.

36:03.041 --> 36:05.041
I'll do... Of course.

36:08.441 --> 36:10.441
Take care, Sylvie.

37:33.401 --> 37:35.561
Look after yourself, Tony. Yes?

37:35.721 --> 37:37.001
I will.

37:37.161 --> 37:39.601
And start trying to live your life, hein?

37:39.761 --> 37:41.761
I will.

37:46.001 --> 37:48.121
I just keep thinking...

37:49.001 --> 37:51.721
The only person
that saw the body was Georges...

37:52.281 --> 37:53.561
The search is in hand.

37:53.721 --> 37:58.481
But in the reports it said
that you investigated a lead in Paris, 2006.

37:59.601 --> 38:02.001
An undercover source
had heard that the caid de cite

38:02.161 --> 38:05.241
were planning to move a package
to the Far East.

38:05.401 --> 38:09.161
- You must've thought that could've been Oliver?
- It turned out to be nothing but a ruse,

38:09.321 --> 38:10.401
to flush out Léon.

38:10.561 --> 38:13.441
Yeah. But the rumour
must have started somewhere.

38:13.721 --> 38:15.361
Tony.

38:15.521 --> 38:17.921
Alain confessed to us what happened.

38:18.081 --> 38:22.041
His own brother-
the man who he trusted with this secret-

38:22.201 --> 38:25.161
would have no reason to lie to him
about seeing Oliver's body.

38:25.321 --> 38:29.001
Yeah, but that's just it. We don't have a body.

38:29.161 --> 38:32.881
More often than not this is the case
in these situations. It is the sad reality.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.601
I'm sorry to say this, but the painful truth is...

38:37.921 --> 38:42.121
what happened to your boy
is perhaps the best you could have hoped for.

38:44.481 --> 38:49.401
Rather he died than end up
in the hands of a man such as Ian Garrett.

38:50.641 --> 38:52.801
Or that he became one of those poor children,

38:52.961 --> 38:55.481
kept captive,
away from sunlight and human contact

38:55.641 --> 38:59.081
in someone's prison of a basement
for their whole lives.

39:01.041 --> 39:04.921
You wish he were alive.
But what kind of a life is that?

39:05.081 --> 39:09.761
But how can I leave with Georges still out there?
Without knowing...

39:10.361 --> 39:12.961
This time we must leave the search to others.

39:13.321 --> 39:14.761
Laurence is on the case.

39:14.921 --> 39:19.401
And stop torturing yourself with what might
have been when we've already heard the truth.

39:26.761 --> 39:28.121
<i>Oh.</i>

39:32.681 --> 39:36.841
I got you this.
It's erm... a rehab centre in London.

39:37.001 --> 39:39.201
It's supposed to be the best.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.961
I just thought your daughter...

39:43.761 --> 39:46.921
I know it's none of my business but I thought...

39:49.361 --> 39:51.361
You can't give up trying.

39:55.881 --> 39:59.401
Trust me. Just don't give up.

40:00.601 --> 40:02.801
No matter what.

40:05.161 --> 40:07.161
Thank you.

40:09.761 --> 40:13.881
Well... Have a good trip home.

40:14.921 --> 40:16.921
What home?

40:20.201 --> 40:23.401
Home... Home is not just a place, Tony.

40:25.001 --> 40:28.481
It's whatever there is in your life
that stops you feeling alone.

41:22.081 --> 41:24.081
(Children playing)

41:33.001 --> 41:34.241
(Keys jangle)

41:40.601 --> 41:42.601
(Boy calls out)

42:45.001 --> 42:47.001
(Soft creaking)

42:58.561 --> 43:00.561
(Bird calls)

44:00.001 --> 44:02.001
(Speaks French)

44:21.601 --> 44:22.921
(Gunshot)

44:23.081 --> 44:24.481
(Squawking)

44:56.881 --> 44:58.881
JULIEN: Georges!

44:59.521 --> 45:01.521
(Laurence calls out in French)

45:45.881 --> 45:46.961
Non.

45:47.121 --> 45:49.001
Non. Non!

46:18.441 --> 46:20.441
(Low speech)

46:21.281 --> 46:24.801
He had to ask the suspect
how the new Lexus he was driving handled.

46:24.961 --> 46:27.761
He seemed more interested
in the transmission modes

46:27.921 --> 46:31.841
than the four pounds of coke we'd found
packed inside the spare wheel.

46:32.001 --> 46:34.281
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, to Mark and Emily.

46:34.441 --> 46:36.441
GUESTS: Mark and Emily!

46:42.441 --> 46:44.041
(Chatter)

46:55.881 --> 46:57.681
Right, erm...

46:57.841 --> 47:00.441
I know it's not usual for the bride
to make a speech...

47:00.601 --> 47:04.201
and in this instance she probably shouldn't
with the amount of wine I've drunk.

47:04.361 --> 47:06.361
(Laughter)

47:09.481 --> 47:11.601
And I wasn't going to, but erm...

47:12.681 --> 47:14.681
I wanted to say something.

47:15.921 --> 47:18.121
I wanted to thank you all...

47:21.361 --> 47:23.361
...for everything.

47:25.761 --> 47:28.361
When something bad happens...

47:29.401 --> 47:30.921
...a tragedy like ours...

47:31.081 --> 47:33.681
It's the other people that help you through it.

47:36.401 --> 47:39.321
Me and my ex-husband, we were both...

47:41.001 --> 47:43.001
(sighs) ..lost.

47:44.761 --> 47:48.761
So much so that
we even lost each other along the way.

47:52.121 --> 47:54.521
But there were other people there to help us.

47:56.001 --> 47:58.001
<i>To stop us from drowning.</i>

48:11.321 --> 48:13.921
<i>And to help us to try and start living.</i>

48:15.361 --> 48:17.361
<i>So we could stand on our own two feet.</i>

48:26.721 --> 48:28.561
<i>And you see...</i>

48:28.721 --> 48:31.641
<i>without these people we'd be nowhere.</i>

48:33.001 --> 48:37.401
<i>And the good things that happen to us
would mean nothing.</i>

48:40.081 --> 48:42.881
<i>- And neither would the bad.
- (Monitor bleeping)</i>

48:45.121 --> 48:47.121
(Sobs)

48:56.801 --> 48:58.961
And you've always been there.

49:15.761 --> 49:18.161
And that's what's kept me going.

49:25.721 --> 49:28.881
People always tell me how...brave I am.

49:29.121 --> 49:31.401
But, to be honest, I think that's bullshit.

49:35.281 --> 49:38.321
You're the brave one, Mark.
For sticking with me.

49:40.121 --> 49:41.681
Er... To Mark and Emily!

49:42.681 --> 49:44.801
GUESTS:
To Mark and Emily!

49:44.961 --> 49:47.521
Now cheer up and put some bloody music on!

49:47.681 --> 49:49.681
- Yeah!
GUESTS: Yeah!

50:24.041 --> 50:26.041
(Rubs sleeve)

50:35.161 --> 50:37.161
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

50:37.481 --> 50:40.441
Sorry, l...I've got some cake on my sleeve.

50:40.601 --> 50:42.601
Oh, let me help.

50:47.241 --> 50:49.241
Here.

50:49.881 --> 50:51.881
Hmm.

50:52.801 --> 50:55.601
- Oh, God, that's yours, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

50:56.761 --> 50:59.241
I like that you put it up.

50:59.401 --> 51:01.601
- I think it was Mark actually.
- Oh.

51:02.721 --> 51:04.041
Well, he's a man of taste.

51:04.201 --> 51:06.081
God, the amount of '80s music he listens to

51:06.241 --> 51:09.841
I actually started to miss
your damn Blues obsession. Briefly.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.281
- That's not really doing the job.
- Don't worry about it.

51:13.441 --> 51:15.441
- No, it's fine...
- It's fine.

51:17.561 --> 51:19.561
(Phone buzzing)

51:22.801 --> 51:24.801
It's Julien.

51:30.761 --> 51:32.761
I'll speak to him later.

51:40.801 --> 51:42.481
It's a lovely wedding.

51:42.641 --> 51:46.561
Bit last-minute, but...
didn't really have the money for it since...

51:47.601 --> 51:49.401
Yeah.

51:51.401 --> 51:53.721
Did you read about Vincent Bourg?

51:55.681 --> 51:59.001
He was in some kind of treatment programme
for what he was,

51:59.161 --> 52:01.681
and, well, he committed suicide.

52:05.441 --> 52:07.521
<i>I don't</i> know. <i>I...</i>

52:08.241 --> 52:10.521
I think he was wrong for giving up.

52:12.561 --> 52:15.921
I believe that people can change,
they can leave their past behind them.

52:22.761 --> 52:24.561
Anyway...

52:25.441 --> 52:27.641
Are you OK, Tony?

52:28.481 --> 52:30.481
Yeah, I'm fine.

52:37.641 --> 52:39.881
Can I tell you something?

52:41.121 --> 52:43.121
Anything-

52:47.921 --> 52:50.801
When we found out that Olly died...

52:51.801 --> 52:53.801
I actually felt relieved.

52:54.601 --> 52:57.041
Just to know what happened.

52:57.201 --> 52:58.841
I only felt it for a split second.

53:00.121 --> 53:02.321
Isn't that just awful?

53:06.401 --> 53:08.201
No...

53:09.801 --> 53:11.521
I understand.

53:20.401 --> 53:23.721
But it's a new day. It's your day.

53:26.601 --> 53:29.001
You should be out there.

53:31.001 --> 53:32.601
<i>No.</i>

53:34.081 --> 53:38.881
I'd like to stay here with you...if that's OK.

53:39.201 --> 53:41.201
Yeah.

53:57.321 --> 53:59.321
<i>(Wind whistles)</i>

54:30.001 --> 54:32.001
<i>(Pen on paper)</i>

54:33.361 --> 54:35.361
- Julien.
- Hi, Tony.

54:35.721 --> 54:38.401
- Listen, I'm sorry, I hope I didn't wake you.
- It's OK.

54:38.561 --> 54:40.801
I got your message.

54:40.961 --> 54:42.961
Georges... Jesus.

54:43.401 --> 54:46.441
Did he leave anything behind?
Any clues, anything that could help us?

54:46.601 --> 54:47.681
<i>Please, Tony.</i>

54:47.841 --> 54:49.841
What about the Romanian who cut Rini's throat?

54:50.001 --> 54:52.681
If the caid de cite helped Georges get away,
and we find them...

54:52.841 --> 54:55.361
<i>Listen, Tony. Your son is gone. That's enough.</i>

54:55.521 --> 54:58.081
But we don't have his body.

54:58.241 --> 55:00.521
All we have is what Alain told us. And...

55:01.361 --> 55:04.521
You know, which means
we don't have anything for sure.

55:04.681 --> 55:08.921
<i>If you can't live with your doubts,
they will destroy you, Tony.</i>

55:14.361 --> 55:15.561
(Wind whistles)

55:15.721 --> 55:17.721
(Boy calls out in Russian)

55:21.001 --> 55:23.401
(Shouting in Russian)

56:14.801 --> 56:16.881
(Boy speaks Russian)

56:22.561 --> 56:24.801
It's you.

56:25.481 --> 56:27.801
It's you, isn't it?

56:32.361 --> 56:37.041
My boy. My little boy.

56:38.841 --> 56:39.921
Olly, come here.

56:40.081 --> 56:43.241
No, no, I don't want to hurt you.
I'd never hurt you.

56:45.121 --> 56:47.121
(Speaks Russian)

56:51.241 --> 56:53.881
Open it, open it. Yes.

56:57.241 --> 56:59.641
You...You see, Olly...

56:59.801 --> 57:01.801
- (Boy speaks Russian)
- Yeah.

57:03.601 --> 57:05.481
My boy. Come here.

57:05.641 --> 57:08.681
Yes, Olly. Tell me...tell me it's you.

57:08.841 --> 57:10.841
Tell me, Olly. Tell me it's you.

57:11.161 --> 57:12.801
No, he's my son! Yes, yes, yes.

57:12.961 --> 57:14.481
No, it's my son. No, no!

57:14.641 --> 57:16.681
No, he's my son. Olly. No. No.

57:16.841 --> 57:19.961
- Olly, come here. Come with me!
- (Shouting in Russian)

57:21.201 --> 57:22.961
No! No, Olly!

57:23.121 --> 57:25.241
No! No!

57:32.441 --> 57:35.601
He's my son! ooo!

57:35.761 --> 57:38.361
Olly! I've found you!
