00:01.169 --> 00:03.006
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.089 --> 00:04.843
How can I tell him
that everything

00:04.927 --> 00:07.389
that has happened to her
is because of me?

00:07.473 --> 00:09.728
He's never gonna forgive me.

00:09.811 --> 00:11.982
Hannah knows how hard
we tried to find her.

00:12.066 --> 00:13.611
‐How could she?
‐'Cause I told her.

00:13.694 --> 00:14.988
Mommy.

00:15.072 --> 00:17.702
Daddy and I will
always love you.

00:17.786 --> 00:19.080
And we would never stop.

00:19.163 --> 00:21.417
The accused stand charged
with gender treachery,

00:21.502 --> 00:23.589
in violation of Romans,
chapter 1.

00:23.673 --> 00:26.010
[Judge] Martha,
you are hereby sentenced to

00:26.094 --> 00:27.597
‐the Common Mercy of the State.
‐[Ofglen screams]

00:27.681 --> 00:29.851
[Judge] Handmaid, you are
sentenced to Redemption.

00:29.935 --> 00:30.812
[screams]

00:30.895 --> 00:33.859
I have sources.
Witnesses to your involvement

00:33.943 --> 00:36.072
in Commander Winslow's
disappearance.

00:36.155 --> 00:39.495
Unless you arrange
for my immediate reinstatement.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.249
You want me to restore
your position,

00:41.332 --> 00:42.961
I need my seat
back at the table.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.633
And your information
can help me get it.

00:46.259 --> 00:48.305
[Lawrence]
Let's fix this country.

00:48.388 --> 00:49.975
Let's make things right again.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.313
‐[gasps]
‐Ooh, sorry.

00:52.396 --> 00:53.566
No. It's okay.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.611
So, do you‐‐

00:55.695 --> 00:57.532
[Commander Fred] With Offred
now in Canada,

00:57.615 --> 00:59.201
we can't be naive about that.

00:59.285 --> 01:01.665
She could put us both away
for the maximum sentence

01:01.749 --> 01:04.128
and prevent you
from being a mother to your son.

01:04.211 --> 01:06.174
We need to drop our fight.

01:06.257 --> 01:07.384
What do you guys know
about Serena?

01:07.468 --> 01:10.975
‐She's pregnant.
‐Is it his? The Commander's?

01:11.100 --> 01:13.146
[June breathing heavily]

01:13.229 --> 01:14.691
All right. June, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.404
‐June, June.
‐[June moaning]

01:19.241 --> 01:22.247
[June] She's pathological.
She's a sociopath.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.128
She's toxic. And abusive.

01:25.462 --> 01:26.757
She's a monster.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.515
Do you know why
God made you pregnant?

01:30.598 --> 01:35.775
So that when He kills
that baby inside your womb,

01:35.858 --> 01:39.323
you will feel a fraction

01:39.407 --> 01:42.789
of the pain that you caused us

01:42.872 --> 01:47.131
when you tore our children
from our arms!

01:47.339 --> 01:51.222
‐[whimpers]
‐Do you understand me?

01:54.855 --> 01:56.859
[soft song playing]

02:55.016 --> 02:56.728
[Tyler] I felt helpless.

02:57.479 --> 02:59.316
I guess it was...

03:00.528 --> 03:02.489
a way to feel in control.

03:03.491 --> 03:04.828
[Danielle]
Didn't your Commander notice?

03:06.414 --> 03:09.253
[Tyler] I cut high on my arms,
where he couldn't see.

03:10.882 --> 03:11.967
[Vicky] Must have hurt.

03:14.138 --> 03:16.309
[Tyler] Felt good, actually.

03:16.392 --> 03:17.687
Um...

03:18.564 --> 03:20.317
It's like a relief.

03:21.152 --> 03:22.864
Well, cutting was
your way to cope.

03:25.578 --> 03:27.456
[exhales] But you're here now.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.003
You're healing.

03:31.590 --> 03:32.592
You're free.

03:34.679 --> 03:35.973
[Tyler] Yeah.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.311
My Commander's free, too.

03:40.357 --> 03:42.904
At least you get to face
yours in court tomorrow.

03:44.073 --> 03:45.993
[Vicky] I'd be so nervous, June.

03:46.452 --> 03:49.208
I can barely stand to watch
the news about the trial.

03:49.668 --> 03:52.255
It's a "confirmation
of charges" hearing.

03:53.091 --> 03:54.719
And she doesn't have to go.

03:56.807 --> 03:58.894
There's nothing wrong
with a written statement.

03:59.938 --> 04:02.317
She wants to tell her
story in person.

04:02.944 --> 04:05.991
[Vicky] Still,
you must be so scared.

04:06.075 --> 04:07.537
[Danielle] And worried.

04:08.162 --> 04:10.543
You know, the defense
gets to ask questions.

04:16.178 --> 04:18.474
I'm not nervous or worried.

04:19.017 --> 04:20.019
Or scared.

04:23.569 --> 04:24.863
I can't fucking wait.

04:27.785 --> 04:29.079
[Emily]
How are you getting home?

04:31.250 --> 04:32.085
Hey.

04:33.046 --> 04:34.089
Hey.

04:35.551 --> 04:36.636
Ready to go, Miss Osborn?

04:36.720 --> 04:38.724
Um, will you just
give me a moment.

04:38.807 --> 04:39.809
Thank you.

04:43.567 --> 04:44.485
[exhales]

04:44.569 --> 04:47.282
So, you kicking me
out of the group?

04:48.493 --> 04:50.080
No. [chuckles]

04:50.163 --> 04:52.125
Just give it some time.
You'll find your groove.

04:54.379 --> 04:55.925
Or maybe you won't.
[laughs]

04:56.008 --> 04:59.599
I just, I thought that I'd have
more in common with them.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.859
Well, they don't all come with
their own security detail, so...

05:05.318 --> 05:06.362
[chuckles]

05:06.445 --> 05:07.573
You know what I mean.

05:08.534 --> 05:10.078
‐[exhales]
‐Feelings...

05:11.330 --> 05:12.415
forgiveness.

05:13.334 --> 05:14.294
Journaling?

05:16.967 --> 05:18.261
Why aren't they more angry?

05:19.556 --> 05:20.933
How do you know they're not?

05:21.601 --> 05:23.396
‐Leave me alone!
‐Emily, I'm so, please, stop.

05:23.479 --> 05:25.651
I just wanna, I just wanna
talk to you for a moment.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.279
Uh, why don't we go sit?

05:27.362 --> 05:28.782
I just wanna talk to you
for five minutes.

05:28.866 --> 05:30.493
I don't want to talk to you.

05:30.578 --> 05:31.872
You look well.
Are you well?

05:31.955 --> 05:33.584
Emily, it's so good‐‐

05:33.667 --> 05:35.504
Hey, hey, hey! Who are you?
What do you want?

05:35.588 --> 05:36.715
[officer]
Is there a problem here?

05:36.798 --> 05:38.176
No, there's no problem.

05:38.259 --> 05:40.639
Um, I just, I just wanna talk.

05:41.056 --> 05:42.518
But it, it doesn't
have to be now.

05:42.602 --> 05:44.229
Um, yeah.

05:44.564 --> 05:46.400
Here's, here's my information‐‐

05:46.483 --> 05:47.778
‐Stop it!
‐Go away!

05:48.070 --> 05:48.947
Please.

05:49.031 --> 05:50.033
Go!

05:52.830 --> 05:53.832
Yeah.

05:58.884 --> 05:59.802
Are you okay?

06:01.180 --> 06:02.182
Who was that?

06:04.228 --> 06:05.606
‐I'm fine.
‐[Moira] You sure?

06:06.566 --> 06:08.570
Yes. Yeah, thank you.

06:08.946 --> 06:09.948
I'll see you there.

06:10.323 --> 06:11.200
Emily...

06:12.035 --> 06:13.580
I'll, I'll see you at home.

06:29.111 --> 06:30.238
It's supposed to be a refresher,

06:30.321 --> 06:32.409
but coding bootcamp
is kicking my ass.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.662
[laughs]

06:33.745 --> 06:35.290
I've been out of the game
a long time.

06:36.751 --> 06:39.339
Have you gotten
to go back into teaching?

06:40.174 --> 06:42.555
I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

06:43.431 --> 06:45.143
Syl's been encouraging me,
but...

06:45.226 --> 06:46.395
Who's Iris Baker?

06:46.813 --> 06:49.151
[rain pattering]

07:03.387 --> 07:05.058
The woman at the library.

07:05.934 --> 07:06.978
What woman?

07:09.357 --> 07:10.736
[thunder rumbling in distance]

07:12.865 --> 07:16.121
Um, I knew her as Irene.

07:17.625 --> 07:20.296
[sighs] Aunt Irene.

07:21.633 --> 07:23.637
She was assigned
to the district

07:23.720 --> 07:26.810
where I had my first posting

07:26.893 --> 07:28.020
before I met you.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.615
And what did she want?

07:33.698 --> 07:35.994
Ah, doesn't matter 'cause Emily
doesn't want to talk to her.

07:36.871 --> 07:37.790
I don't know.

07:39.752 --> 07:42.633
‐She hurt you, didn't she?
‐[Luke] Why would you say that?

07:42.842 --> 07:44.595
Because she's an Aunt.

07:48.979 --> 07:50.231
You should face her.

07:52.402 --> 07:54.532
‐Emily, you need to...
‐June. June.

07:54.615 --> 07:56.870
You have to get out everything
you have been holding in.

07:57.663 --> 08:00.293
I promise you,
you will feel better.

08:00.586 --> 08:02.046
Well, we're not all like you.

08:02.130 --> 08:03.508
[rain pattering]

08:05.011 --> 08:07.390
[thunder rumbling]

08:19.749 --> 08:21.753
That Aunt Irene
must have been brutal.

08:22.086 --> 08:23.464
How bad could she be?

08:24.049 --> 08:26.178
Aunt Lydia set
a high fucking bar.

08:26.261 --> 08:28.015
Yeah, well, if Emily
wanted you to know,

08:28.098 --> 08:30.687
I'm sure she would've
just told you, right?

08:31.856 --> 08:32.983
Apparently.

08:34.987 --> 08:36.616
So, you sure

08:37.283 --> 08:39.371
you wouldn't feel better
if I was there tomorrow?

08:41.793 --> 08:44.339
It would just hurt you
to hear those things...

08:46.844 --> 08:48.264
about me, so...

08:48.932 --> 08:50.434
I, I don't want that.

08:58.618 --> 09:02.668
So, Mark Tuello
was really interested

09:02.751 --> 09:06.258
in the, um, the lake house
where you saw Hannah.

09:06.341 --> 09:08.763
And he said he could
find some photos

09:08.847 --> 09:09.682
that you could look at.

09:09.765 --> 09:11.519
Why did you tell him about that?

09:12.646 --> 09:15.276
Because this is the first
new information

09:15.359 --> 09:18.115
that we've had on Hannah
in, like, forever.

09:18.198 --> 09:19.869
It means that we can
restart the search.

09:19.952 --> 09:22.040
‐Yeah, but I didn't want...
‐But don't you want that?

09:22.123 --> 09:24.795
...to tell him about that. Yet.

09:29.722 --> 09:31.684
All right. All right.

09:31.768 --> 09:33.605
I don't know why
you would've told him.

09:33.897 --> 09:34.899
[exhales deeply]

09:36.360 --> 09:38.322
That kid is like
a motion detector.

09:38.405 --> 09:39.575
I had to sneak out like a ninja.

09:40.034 --> 09:41.663
‐Luke, can you finish these?
‐Uh, yeah, I got it.

09:41.746 --> 09:43.415
I want to go look
at my testimony.

09:58.028 --> 10:00.826
She, uh, says she doesn't
want me there tomorrow.

10:03.581 --> 10:05.126
Well, if she wanted
a cheering section,

10:05.209 --> 10:06.546
she would've asked us to come.

10:08.048 --> 10:09.426
[sighs]

10:11.764 --> 10:13.475
I just don't know. I don't...

10:15.438 --> 10:16.691
I don't know what she wants.

10:20.699 --> 10:22.578
She is like a stranger
half the time.

10:22.661 --> 10:24.080
I mean, it's like...

10:26.418 --> 10:29.340
when we talk about Hannah.

10:29.717 --> 10:31.219
And...

10:34.643 --> 10:35.562
in bed.

10:43.620 --> 10:46.876
[sighs] Getting over trauma
is a bumpy fucking road.

10:49.088 --> 10:50.216
Yeah.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.763
You need to be patient

10:54.015 --> 10:55.811
till June gets
where she's going.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.365
You don't know
what she's been through.

11:06.289 --> 11:07.751
Maybe that's the problem.

11:20.527 --> 11:21.779
[door beeps, unlocks]

11:24.117 --> 11:26.079
[Serena reading]
"Mr. Waterford's sexual tastes

11:26.162 --> 11:27.206
were very pedestrian.

11:27.290 --> 11:30.087
On occasion,
he couldn't even perform.

11:30.421 --> 11:31.256
When that happened,

11:31.339 --> 11:33.176
he'd make me have sex
with another Jezebel

11:33.260 --> 11:35.097
while he watched
and masturbated."

11:35.515 --> 11:37.184
And a good evening to you too.

11:37.268 --> 11:39.230
Moira Strand,
she paints quite the picture.

11:39.314 --> 11:40.942
[Commander Fred]
A deviant and a liar.

11:41.026 --> 11:43.113
Judges didn't seem to think so,
I watched the footage.

11:43.196 --> 11:44.073
And it didn't help

11:44.157 --> 11:46.161
that you were rolling your eyes
the entire time.

11:46.244 --> 11:47.539
Why did you want
to see me, Serena?

11:47.623 --> 11:49.752
‐Tomorrow's a big day.
‐Exactly. I'm concerned.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.048
Dawn's prepared. She knows
what Offred's gonna say.

11:52.131 --> 11:53.300
I'm not worried about Dawn.

11:53.383 --> 11:54.803
You need
to get it together, Fred.

11:54.887 --> 11:57.893
Everything that you do
reflects on the both of us.

11:57.976 --> 12:01.525
All of us, actually.
So calling her June would help.

12:01.609 --> 12:02.903
You know what
would really help?

12:02.986 --> 12:05.784
If you came to court.
If you stood by your husband.

12:05.867 --> 12:07.286
You know I haven't
felt up to it.

12:07.913 --> 12:09.165
You've never felt better.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.044
The world already knows
I'm pregnant.

12:11.127 --> 12:12.673
They need to know
we're a family.

12:12.756 --> 12:15.010
Appearances matter,
Mrs. Waterford.

12:16.012 --> 12:18.100
Besides,

12:18.183 --> 12:21.816
do you want June to think
you're afraid to face her?

12:29.957 --> 12:31.376
I'll see you in the morning.

12:33.798 --> 12:35.259
[door beeps, unlocks]

12:36.344 --> 12:38.516
Oh, maybe wear the teal.

12:40.812 --> 12:42.231
[door beeps, locks]

13:02.564 --> 13:03.983
You're not finished yet?

13:05.194 --> 13:07.239
[scrubbing]

13:09.327 --> 13:10.162
Move on!

13:10.622 --> 13:12.333
[others talking indistinctly]

13:16.466 --> 13:18.596
Have you never washed a floor?

13:19.556 --> 13:20.683
Give me it!

13:21.685 --> 13:23.313
Put something into it!

13:25.944 --> 13:27.572
It's deplorable.

13:29.868 --> 13:31.789
[whispering indistinctly,
chuckling]

13:37.551 --> 13:39.972
Gossip is a tool
of the Devil, ladies.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.395
We were just saying
what a blessing it is

13:43.478 --> 13:45.232
to have you back, Aunt Lydia.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.861
A blessing.

13:48.614 --> 13:49.908
Aren't you kind?

13:52.079 --> 13:55.460
But we must set a good example,
mustn't we?

13:56.004 --> 13:57.423
[Aunt] Of course, Aunt Lydia.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.395
Kylie! You missed a spot.

14:04.980 --> 14:06.482
I'm sorry, Aunt Lydia.

14:15.627 --> 14:17.129
It's still there!

14:17.463 --> 14:19.216
I think it's a stain,
Aunt Lydia.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.680
‐You're impertinent, girl!
‐[screams]

14:21.764 --> 14:23.099
Aunt Lydia! Stop!

14:23.183 --> 14:24.185
[screams]

14:25.062 --> 14:27.483
[groaning in pain]

14:27.901 --> 14:30.322
[both groaning]

14:35.917 --> 14:37.796
[breathing heavily]

14:53.368 --> 14:55.372
[indistinct chatter]

14:57.376 --> 14:59.380
[footsteps approaching]

15:02.469 --> 15:03.556
It's time.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.713
[heels clicking]

15:28.564 --> 15:29.566
[door unlatching]

15:42.550 --> 15:44.513
[Judge] Next we will hear
the victim statement

15:44.596 --> 15:45.973
of June Osborn.

15:56.578 --> 15:57.831
Please raise your right hand.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.500
Is there a Bible?

16:00.127 --> 16:01.797
No, Ma'am. Not in this court.

16:02.214 --> 16:04.385
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

16:04.468 --> 16:06.097
and nothing but the truth?

16:06.598 --> 16:07.474
I do.

16:09.938 --> 16:10.815
[door opens]

16:22.254 --> 16:23.298
[door closes]

16:23.966 --> 16:26.429
Ms. Osborn,
please take the stand.

16:45.801 --> 16:46.929
In your own time.

16:53.233 --> 16:54.736
My name is June Osborn.

16:57.366 --> 16:59.913
Fred Waterford
and Serena Joy Waterford

17:01.249 --> 17:04.129
imprisoned me, beat me,
and raped me.

17:06.551 --> 17:09.390
I came to the Waterfords' house
in 2017.

17:09.766 --> 17:11.394
It was my second posting.

17:13.398 --> 17:14.943
A few days after my arrival,

17:15.026 --> 17:16.571
I was summoned
to the drawing room,

17:17.072 --> 17:19.285
where I was asked to kneel
in front of the Waterfords,

17:19.869 --> 17:22.082
as witnessed by
their housekeeper Rita Blue

17:22.165 --> 17:24.963
and their... driver Nick Blaine.

17:27.426 --> 17:29.931
Mr. Waterford read a story
from the Bible

17:30.181 --> 17:31.977
about Rachel and Bilhah.

17:33.354 --> 17:36.862
After that, I was
taken upstairs to her bedroom.

17:38.156 --> 17:42.624
There, Mr. Waterford raped me
while his wife held me down.

17:45.253 --> 17:47.759
This happened
for three successive nights

17:47.842 --> 17:49.763
every month when
I was ovulating.

17:50.723 --> 17:53.269
These were the legally
sanctioned rapes.

17:54.606 --> 17:55.608
There were others.

17:58.614 --> 18:02.454
Mrs. Waterford was desperate
for me to get pregnant

18:02.538 --> 18:06.128
and questioned
her husband's fertility.

18:06.713 --> 18:09.594
She ordered me to have sex
with their driver.

18:11.430 --> 18:15.940
Another violation of Gilead law
that I could not refuse.

18:17.317 --> 18:19.279
Mr. Blaine and I
had intercourse,

18:20.115 --> 18:21.952
while Mrs. Waterford
was in the room,

18:22.035 --> 18:24.081
watching us the entire time.

18:27.087 --> 18:31.095
I did become pregnant
with my daughter Nichole.

18:33.224 --> 18:34.435
My daughter.

18:36.606 --> 18:38.610
During a visit
to a doctor's office,

18:38.694 --> 18:41.867
the underground
resistance movement in Gilead

18:42.451 --> 18:45.039
provided the means
for me to escape,

18:45.123 --> 18:47.461
and I stayed in hiding
for two months.

18:47.837 --> 18:50.425
Eventually, I found my way
to an ally's small plane

18:50.509 --> 18:51.845
leaving for Canada,

18:52.555 --> 18:54.768
but just before takeoff,
I was captured,

18:55.101 --> 18:56.730
and I was brought back
to the Waterfords',

18:56.813 --> 18:59.359
where the mistreatment
and abuse continued.

19:01.405 --> 19:04.244
At nine months pregnant,
I went into false labor.

19:06.040 --> 19:10.089
For this, Mrs. Waterford
was very angry with me

19:10.883 --> 19:13.387
and felt embarrassed
in front of her friends

19:13.471 --> 19:15.643
who had gathered
to witness the birth.

19:18.022 --> 19:19.651
As punishment,

19:21.988 --> 19:24.493
Mr. Waterford raped me again...

19:26.873 --> 19:28.417
while she held me down.

19:32.510 --> 19:33.512
I struggled

19:34.889 --> 19:37.520
and pleaded for them to stop.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.528
They did not.

19:46.078 --> 19:48.124
After I gave birth,
the Waterfords forbid

19:48.207 --> 19:50.754
any contact
with my daughter Nichole,

19:51.506 --> 19:54.596
although I was still expected
to provide breast milk for her.

19:56.641 --> 19:58.352
Eventually, I managed
to convince them

19:58.436 --> 20:00.356
to let me to spend
some time with her.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.908
Mrs. Waterford did make
one attempt

20:05.283 --> 20:07.203
to improve conditions
for the women

20:07.287 --> 20:08.874
and young girls of Gilead.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.632
She appeared in front
of the Commanders' Council

20:13.132 --> 20:15.638
and read out loud
from the Bible.

20:17.182 --> 20:20.940
For this crime of reading,
they cut off her finger.

20:23.277 --> 20:27.118
Mr. Waterford, her husband,
did not object.

20:29.582 --> 20:32.337
When I confronted Mr. Waterford
about his brutality,

20:32.838 --> 20:35.928
he struck me and threatened
to cut out my tongue.

20:39.267 --> 20:40.604
I hit him back,

20:42.232 --> 20:45.154
even though it could mean
execution for me.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.248
I suppose I was past
caring by then.

20:52.962 --> 20:54.716
Later, with the help
of Rita Blue

20:54.799 --> 20:57.053
and other housekeepers
in the neighborhood,

20:57.137 --> 20:59.349
I had a second opportunity
to escape Gilead,

20:59.433 --> 21:02.105
this time with
my daughter Nichole.

21:06.238 --> 21:08.827
But I couldn't leave
my other daughter Hannah behind.

21:10.956 --> 21:15.339
So I stayed, to try to save her.

21:18.471 --> 21:19.766
To bring her back

21:21.644 --> 21:22.730
to her father,

21:23.607 --> 21:24.692
my husband.

21:28.742 --> 21:29.911
I failed.

21:35.421 --> 21:38.302
This time, when I was captured,
I was sent to a new household,

21:38.637 --> 21:40.766
where Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Lawrence

21:40.849 --> 21:42.937
did not subject me to any rapes,

21:43.939 --> 21:46.026
at great risk
to their own lives.

21:47.696 --> 21:49.199
But Mr. Waterford

21:49.617 --> 21:52.247
later arranged for me
to be raped by Mr. Lawrence

21:52.330 --> 21:54.042
as a test of loyalty.

21:56.130 --> 21:57.800
The Waterfords drank coffee

21:58.217 --> 22:02.183
while upstairs I had sex
with Mr. Lawrence

22:02.267 --> 22:04.689
against both of our wishes
in front of his wife.

22:08.530 --> 22:09.866
Mrs. Lawrence...

22:13.665 --> 22:14.499
Eleanor...

22:15.794 --> 22:18.174
was a kind and fragile woman,

22:19.342 --> 22:20.428
and this experience

22:23.350 --> 22:24.436
devastated her.

22:26.816 --> 22:29.572
That was the last time
I saw Mr. Waterford...

22:30.824 --> 22:31.826
until now.

22:44.017 --> 22:46.396
I am grateful to be speaking
to you today.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.822
But mine is just one voice.

22:53.285 --> 22:54.580
Countless others

22:57.418 --> 22:58.588
will remain unheard,

22:59.799 --> 23:03.723
imprisoned by men
like Fred Waterford.

23:05.268 --> 23:06.353
Women...

23:12.407 --> 23:14.286
my friends...

23:19.421 --> 23:20.882
who lost their lives

23:22.093 --> 23:23.847
and can never be heard.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.361
It is for those women

23:33.825 --> 23:36.246
that I ask
the International Criminal Court

23:36.330 --> 23:38.752
to confirm the charges
against this man

23:39.879 --> 23:41.340
and put him on trial.

23:44.304 --> 23:47.226
I ask for the maximum
possible sentence.

23:51.944 --> 23:53.573
I ask for justice.

23:56.328 --> 23:57.539
Thank you.

24:18.414 --> 24:19.625
[Judge] Thank you, Ms. Osborn.

24:22.338 --> 24:24.092
The defense now
has the opportunity

24:24.175 --> 24:25.679
to ask a few questions.

24:26.096 --> 24:27.098
Thank you, Your Honor.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.605
[Judge] I remind you
that this is not a trial.

24:30.689 --> 24:31.816
Keep your questioning brief.

24:31.899 --> 24:33.193
Of course, Your Honor.

24:37.703 --> 24:39.748
You had an affair with
a married man, is that correct?

24:40.416 --> 24:41.334
For months?

24:41.418 --> 24:42.378
[Judge] Ms. Mathis.

24:42.462 --> 24:44.257
I just want the record
to show that Ms. Osborn

24:44.340 --> 24:48.725
has a history of deceitfulness
around sex and infidelity.

24:49.685 --> 24:51.522
And your adultery,

24:51.856 --> 24:52.691
your sin,

24:53.400 --> 24:54.695
that's why you're here today.

24:55.488 --> 24:56.490
Isn't it true, Ms. Osborn,

24:56.574 --> 24:58.243
that you chose
to become a Handmaid?

24:58.452 --> 24:59.872
It wasn't much of a choice.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.961
It was either that or get sent
to the Colonies.

25:03.295 --> 25:04.507
That is a yes, then?

25:06.134 --> 25:07.638
You knew what
you were signing up for.

25:07.721 --> 25:09.432
You knowingly agreed
to the Ceremony.

25:11.353 --> 25:14.108
I didn't sign up to get raped
when I was nine months pregnant,

25:14.192 --> 25:15.194
no.

25:15.277 --> 25:16.614
It was another holy Ceremony.

25:16.697 --> 25:17.533
Mr. Waterford‐‐

25:17.616 --> 25:19.327
[Commander Fred] To bring God's
gift into the world safely.

25:19.410 --> 25:20.747
It was for the health
of the child.

25:20.830 --> 25:22.041
Ms. Mathis,
please control your client.

25:22.124 --> 25:23.711
That's enough, Mr. Waterford.

25:23.795 --> 25:25.715
[Commander Fred] God tests us.
He tests us with a heavy hand.

25:25.799 --> 25:28.721
The sacrifices we all made
in Gilead were difficult.

25:29.138 --> 25:31.727
But where else on Earth
is the birth rate rising?

25:32.019 --> 25:35.109
Nowhere. Only in Gilead
because it works.

25:35.276 --> 25:36.862
It works.

25:37.739 --> 25:39.577
We chose God's path

25:41.956 --> 25:44.587
and have been rewarded
for our suffering.

25:48.636 --> 25:51.266
Tell me, how was I rewarded
for my suffering?

25:51.349 --> 25:54.022
Your beautiful baby daughter
and your other daughter.

25:54.105 --> 25:54.982
I let you see her.

25:55.065 --> 25:56.736
I arranged for the two of them
to meet, a kindness,

25:56.819 --> 25:59.073
‐she left that out.
‐I am done!

26:07.633 --> 26:09.052
I am done.

26:11.389 --> 26:13.310
Anything more
can wait for your trial.

26:29.968 --> 26:31.972
[thunder rumbling]

26:34.937 --> 26:36.022
[door opens]

26:36.691 --> 26:37.943
[clears throat]

26:38.276 --> 26:40.615
[footsteps approaching]

26:45.416 --> 26:47.546
[sighs] Come.

26:49.508 --> 26:50.844
[clears throat]

26:54.308 --> 26:56.689
Commander, it was an accident.

26:57.022 --> 26:58.526
Aunt Ruth got in my way,

26:58.609 --> 27:01.197
‐she is often clumsy‐‐
‐Oh, bullshit.

27:02.366 --> 27:05.372
Aunt Ruth has a different story.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.629
Not that I care about
that one either. [groans]

27:10.299 --> 27:11.969
But the Handmaid!

27:12.052 --> 27:14.390
By, by all accounts
she was obedient

27:14.474 --> 27:16.645
and, uh, compliant.

27:19.192 --> 27:20.862
They all are, these days.

27:21.989 --> 27:24.995
They've known Gilead
most of their lives.

27:26.331 --> 27:28.503
Unlike some.

27:33.261 --> 27:37.311
Boy, it must be killing you
that June won.

27:37.394 --> 27:40.359
Out of your reach,
free as a bird.

27:41.695 --> 27:45.410
And singing like one, too.

27:47.081 --> 27:49.168
Well, she will...

27:50.922 --> 27:52.299
answer to God.

27:54.596 --> 27:55.598
We'll see.

27:57.059 --> 27:59.313
Maybe she'll just wrap
that old goat

27:59.397 --> 28:01.192
around her little finger too.

28:02.486 --> 28:05.660
June won because she knows
how to make people like her.

28:05.743 --> 28:07.288
People do not like you.

28:09.835 --> 28:10.837
They don't.

28:11.505 --> 28:13.091
I, I can sympathize.

28:13.174 --> 28:14.970
People don't like me either.

28:15.053 --> 28:16.347
But...

28:17.559 --> 28:18.519
[sighs softly]

28:20.022 --> 28:23.529
These reports will stop.

28:24.656 --> 28:26.159
Are you going to terminate me?

28:29.750 --> 28:30.752
[sighs]

28:35.344 --> 28:36.680
I don't want to.

28:39.561 --> 28:40.563
I don't.

28:43.318 --> 28:45.155
I want you back in form.

28:45.447 --> 28:46.449
Oh.

28:46.533 --> 28:49.915
The work that I'm doing,
that we, that we are doing

28:49.998 --> 28:51.877
is the future of Gilead.

28:51.960 --> 28:57.096
And that means the world to me.

28:57.179 --> 28:58.264
Everything to me.

28:58.891 --> 29:01.396
Yes. Yes.

29:01.730 --> 29:03.024
So, no.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.318
No.

29:06.239 --> 29:07.867
I'm not terminating you.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.965
But, uh, today,
we have a situation.

29:15.508 --> 29:18.471
A fugitive Handmaid
captured in Chicago.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.273
[gasps] Ah!

29:26.195 --> 29:29.118
[Lawrence]
The trouble that she's caused

29:29.201 --> 29:31.832
and the defiance.

29:31.915 --> 29:37.301
It's such a poor reflection
on your training. On Gilead.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.388
Yes. Ah...

29:40.390 --> 29:41.602
Commander, I,

29:42.394 --> 29:44.733
I assure you,
this girl was led astray.

29:45.025 --> 29:47.530
This girl was
your responsibility,

29:48.364 --> 29:49.200
am I right?

29:49.785 --> 29:51.955
Yes. Yes, she is.

29:52.749 --> 29:53.918
Yes.

30:02.059 --> 30:03.604
It's, uh...

30:05.775 --> 30:09.866
fortuitous, I think, to have her
in our custody right now.

30:09.950 --> 30:14.208
I know you,
you enjoy inflicting pain.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.797
Why... that isn't true.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.383
I'm not judging.

30:18.466 --> 30:20.220
Everybody needs
a hobby, I guess.

30:20.303 --> 30:22.140
Oh, [stuttering]

30:22.224 --> 30:24.395
That's not true.
I, I object to this...

30:24.478 --> 30:28.654
But it is counterproductive
for you to inflict that pain

30:29.573 --> 30:31.450
on your students
at the Red Center,

30:31.535 --> 30:34.123
let alone on your colleagues.

30:34.206 --> 30:36.628
‐Do you understand?
‐I do, yes.

30:37.547 --> 30:40.051
You need a better outlet.

30:43.224 --> 30:44.603
So...

30:46.732 --> 30:48.234
do with her what you will.

30:55.875 --> 30:57.670
[breathing heavily] Oh, God.

31:02.012 --> 31:03.097
[breathes deeply]

31:03.431 --> 31:05.185
[Moira]
It's just like Waterford...

31:06.354 --> 31:08.232
to try to spin Gilead.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.195
[scoffs]

31:10.278 --> 31:11.698
Lipstick on a pig.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.368
The Internet's having
a field day.

31:13.451 --> 31:15.413
‐Such a loser.
‐[Vicky] Yeah.

31:15.455 --> 31:17.877
Here she is.
Woman of the hour.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.839
[all applauding]

31:24.348 --> 31:25.183
[sniffles]

31:26.394 --> 31:27.354
June.

31:28.189 --> 31:30.026
She was waiting for you outside.

31:32.072 --> 31:33.993
Yeah, well, you had no business
trying to bring her in here.

31:34.368 --> 31:36.790
Why? Who is she?

31:37.207 --> 31:38.459
This woman was an Aunt.

31:43.637 --> 31:44.471
Aunt Irene.

31:46.810 --> 31:48.187
[Vicky] Why is she here?

31:49.189 --> 31:50.400
[Tyler] We should call the cops.

31:51.402 --> 31:53.197
This is not the time
or place, June.

31:54.283 --> 31:55.243
[June] Why not?

31:59.794 --> 32:01.172
Why? This is our group,

32:02.215 --> 32:03.051
isn't it?

32:04.804 --> 32:05.890
Who wants her to stay?

32:21.295 --> 32:22.590
I'm trying to help you.

32:25.554 --> 32:26.640
But it's up to you.

32:30.355 --> 32:31.357
Fine.

33:06.636 --> 33:07.680
Well?

33:09.183 --> 33:12.690
You wanted to talk.
Go ahead. It's okay.

33:14.401 --> 33:15.486
[clears throat]

33:19.746 --> 33:21.373
I've done some terrible things.

33:23.336 --> 33:24.714
Every Aunt has.

33:26.217 --> 33:28.179
We were trained
to deliver the corrections‐‐

33:28.262 --> 33:29.264
[June] Corrections?

33:29.682 --> 33:30.935
You mean the beatings.

33:32.270 --> 33:33.272
The torture.

33:34.776 --> 33:36.696
The physical punishment

33:37.239 --> 33:39.577
was meant to help keep
all of you alive.

33:40.036 --> 33:41.247
[scoffs]

33:42.123 --> 33:43.794
But what I did to you was worse.

33:44.169 --> 33:45.589
And I never even touched you.

33:47.635 --> 33:48.720
What did you do?

33:53.605 --> 33:58.991
I learned she had a lover
at her first posting,

33:59.074 --> 34:00.159
a Martha.

34:03.082 --> 34:06.171
They continued the affair
after Emily was reassigned

34:06.255 --> 34:08.885
to Commander Scott
and became Ofglen.

34:08.969 --> 34:10.305
So...

34:11.390 --> 34:12.518
I informed the Eyes.

34:23.372 --> 34:27.673
So you're the reason
why they hung that poor woman.

34:30.470 --> 34:34.353
And you are the reason
why they mutilated Emily.

34:34.687 --> 34:35.689
[Moira] June.

34:38.904 --> 34:40.198
What do you want?

34:43.747 --> 34:45.166
Since I found out you were here,

34:45.249 --> 34:47.462
I, I haven't had
a moment's peace.

34:51.428 --> 34:52.807
I want you to forgive me.

34:53.850 --> 34:54.894
[exhales]

35:00.321 --> 35:02.618
You crossed the border

35:02.702 --> 35:05.874
and pretended
to just be any other refugee.

35:05.958 --> 35:06.835
You lied.

35:07.335 --> 35:10.759
You gave yourself a new life,
a new name

35:10.843 --> 35:13.389
and you thought that
you could just leave

35:13.472 --> 35:16.186
all of the shit you did behind.

35:16.270 --> 35:19.777
Why the fuck do you think
you deserve forgiveness?

35:23.075 --> 35:24.202
We are all God's children.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.373
Bullshit!

35:27.041 --> 35:31.551
You people hide behind God
every time it serves you.

35:35.308 --> 35:39.441
Please. Please, please,
please, Emily.

35:40.986 --> 35:44.744
Tell me what I can do
to make things better.

35:47.081 --> 35:48.292
[chuckles softly]

35:51.089 --> 35:52.091
Nothing.

35:54.931 --> 35:56.601
There's nothing you can do.

36:06.704 --> 36:07.957
[breath trembling]

36:14.177 --> 36:16.181
[wails]

36:46.659 --> 36:47.870
How was group?

36:52.713 --> 36:53.798
It was fine.

36:55.761 --> 36:56.596
Mm.

37:00.771 --> 37:01.981
This is really good.

37:03.652 --> 37:05.071
[chuckles]

37:05.572 --> 37:07.701
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

37:12.711 --> 37:15.634
Look, I'm, uh,
I'm really sorry about today.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.105
About coming to court and...

37:24.527 --> 37:26.071
[breath trembling]

37:28.367 --> 37:30.454
But at least now
I know everything.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.212
And maybe we can
just move on.

37:37.343 --> 37:39.347
I mean, if you want
to talk to me about anything

37:39.431 --> 37:40.851
to do with Hannah or...

37:40.934 --> 37:42.103
I don't.

37:45.109 --> 37:46.319
We're good.

37:46.403 --> 37:49.200
Okay. Okay.

37:53.752 --> 37:55.254
All right. Well, I'm here.

38:00.766 --> 38:01.601
[exhales]

38:05.525 --> 38:06.443
[sniffs]

38:20.847 --> 38:23.060
I, I don't know what to do.

38:23.143 --> 38:24.688
[June] Hey, hey.

38:25.941 --> 38:27.276
I'm trying.

38:39.844 --> 38:40.720
Just tell me.

38:46.732 --> 38:47.901
It's okay.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.064
No, no, June.

39:08.066 --> 39:10.196
June, stop. Just stop it!

39:10.279 --> 39:12.366
Talk to me! Talk to me!

39:13.828 --> 39:15.624
Talk to me.

39:28.065 --> 39:31.488
[breathing heavily]

39:44.264 --> 39:45.307
[exhales]

39:51.737 --> 39:53.992
[door beeps, unlocks]

39:57.582 --> 39:59.085
[thunder rumbling]

40:11.694 --> 40:13.113
[clears throat]

40:29.730 --> 40:33.362
Goodness. You look like
the wreck of the Hesperus.

40:48.016 --> 40:50.354
It was Gilead that
saved you, you know.

40:52.734 --> 40:54.530
Our boys cleaning out Chicago.

40:56.449 --> 40:58.078
They saved you
from starvation.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.086
And worse.

41:08.306 --> 41:09.643
Where's June?

41:16.072 --> 41:17.074
Is she dead?

41:18.201 --> 41:19.788
Your friend is in Canada.

41:20.623 --> 41:21.709
She is?

41:22.669 --> 41:24.297
That godforsaken place.

41:24.380 --> 41:25.424
[chuckles]

41:26.468 --> 41:27.804
She made it.

41:29.348 --> 41:30.184
[laughs]

41:30.267 --> 41:31.770
I always knew
she would make it.

41:34.066 --> 41:35.110
[chuckles]

41:36.362 --> 41:38.366
I don't know why
you're so happy.

41:40.245 --> 41:41.498
June left you.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.675
No, she didn't.

41:47.343 --> 41:48.261
Janine.

41:49.765 --> 41:51.936
Don't tell me she couldn't have
taken you with her.

41:52.687 --> 41:54.106
She's done it before.

41:55.150 --> 41:57.989
Maybe this time,
you were just too much trouble.

42:02.749 --> 42:04.460
It's difficult to know
with that one.

42:06.339 --> 42:07.676
So unpredictable.

42:10.515 --> 42:11.432
Selfish.

42:17.612 --> 42:19.282
I know what happens here.

42:22.581 --> 42:25.670
I know it will keep happening
until I die.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.511
[sighs]

42:32.684 --> 42:35.523
Just don't make me
a Handmaid again, please.

42:42.494 --> 42:44.165
Look what she's done to you.

42:49.593 --> 42:50.595
She corrupts.

42:52.014 --> 42:53.266
She destroys.

42:53.433 --> 42:54.561
Everyone.

43:00.823 --> 43:02.034
[exhales]

43:03.453 --> 43:04.665
You poor thing.

43:09.256 --> 43:11.469
You've spent your entire life

43:13.056 --> 43:14.475
losing the people you love.

43:17.272 --> 43:18.526
[sniffles]

43:23.410 --> 43:24.830
Aunt Lydia, please.

43:28.504 --> 43:30.717
Just don't send me
back into service.

43:32.679 --> 43:34.432
I'd rather die here.

43:39.693 --> 43:41.112
[sighs] Okay.

43:50.965 --> 43:52.802
Well, up you go.

43:57.019 --> 43:57.896
Now...

43:59.649 --> 44:02.112
there is no use
in being theatrical.

44:03.532 --> 44:04.408
Hm?

44:09.795 --> 44:10.922
[sniffles]

44:15.932 --> 44:17.936
[sobs]

44:19.021 --> 44:22.486
Whatever are we going
to do with you?

44:28.916 --> 44:31.003
[indistinct chatter]

44:33.759 --> 44:34.970
I think it was shitty.

44:36.723 --> 44:38.351
June ambushing you like that.

44:40.105 --> 44:43.152
Oh. I, she...

44:44.321 --> 44:45.950
you know,
she thought it would help.

44:47.452 --> 44:48.371
Did it?

44:50.877 --> 44:51.962
I don't know.

44:54.634 --> 44:55.720
It wasn't enough.

44:57.974 --> 44:59.811
You want to see
that woman again?

45:01.063 --> 45:02.984
[exhales] Uh...

45:03.192 --> 45:05.196
I've said all I have to say.

45:05.865 --> 45:07.284
[exhales]

45:09.371 --> 45:10.791
All of us are just

45:13.004 --> 45:16.385
searching for ways
to move forward.

45:18.974 --> 45:21.521
Take all that shit from Gilead
and just...

45:23.191 --> 45:26.030
turn it into something...

45:27.324 --> 45:28.535
useful.

45:30.915 --> 45:32.794
I don't know if that's possible.

45:34.965 --> 45:36.593
I mean, the Waterfords
can't be the only one

45:36.677 --> 45:38.179
the I. C. C.'s going after.

45:38.847 --> 45:39.766
I mean, an Aunt

45:40.392 --> 45:42.020
in the Gilead power structure...

45:44.651 --> 45:46.070
she'd be one hell of a witness.

45:50.663 --> 45:54.504
Maybe you can talk to her again,

45:55.673 --> 45:57.467
in private this time.

45:57.593 --> 45:59.388
Get her to testify.

46:01.350 --> 46:02.394
Yeah. Move forward.

46:04.691 --> 46:05.693
Hm.

46:06.570 --> 46:08.406
[indistinct chatter]

46:16.047 --> 46:18.259
[mystical music playing]

48:07.979 --> 48:09.983
[indistinct chatter]

48:17.540 --> 48:18.750
Protestors.

48:19.794 --> 48:22.550
Sounds like more than usual.

48:24.512 --> 48:26.933
I suppose that was inevitable.

48:28.687 --> 48:30.189
Coming to court again today?

48:33.446 --> 48:35.868
Did you believe
what you said yesterday?

48:38.205 --> 48:39.333
Of course I did.

48:41.086 --> 48:42.005
Hm.

48:44.468 --> 48:45.679
Well, shall we?

48:45.763 --> 48:47.767
[indistinct shouting]

48:55.406 --> 48:57.410
[applauding, cheering]

48:58.914 --> 49:00.918
[indistinct shouting]

49:13.067 --> 49:16.281
They heard us, Mrs. Waterford.

49:33.608 --> 49:35.445
[indistinct shouting continues]

49:39.620 --> 49:41.039
[cheering]

49:56.320 --> 49:57.990
Whoo!

50:06.381 --> 50:08.135
[camera shutter clicking]

50:08.219 --> 50:11.266
[woman] We love you, Serena!
We love you!

50:22.247 --> 50:24.669
I know we're all pretty shocked

50:25.336 --> 50:26.631
about Irene.

50:30.179 --> 50:33.143
Does anyone maybe
wanna say anything?

50:35.356 --> 50:36.568
It's...

50:37.945 --> 50:38.947
so sad.

50:41.493 --> 50:42.705
A trial would've been better.

50:43.540 --> 50:44.374
Prison.

50:45.126 --> 50:47.005
Bitch took the coward's way out.

50:51.013 --> 50:51.848
What do you think?

50:52.473 --> 50:57.317
Well, I think we're all better
than the worst thing we've done.

51:00.072 --> 51:02.578
You shouldn't
feel guilty, Emily.

51:03.705 --> 51:06.251
[Danielle] Yeah, what that
woman did was her choice.

51:07.170 --> 51:09.215
[Vicky]
It must've been so traumatic.

51:10.426 --> 51:12.848
Another hanging,
like your Martha.

51:14.142 --> 51:16.606
You know, you didn't have
anything to do with it.

51:17.733 --> 51:20.196
Why don't we let Emily tell us
how she feels.

51:25.707 --> 51:27.001
If she wants to.

51:31.009 --> 51:32.638
[breath shuddering]

51:40.069 --> 51:42.198
I feel...

51:45.371 --> 51:46.582
amazing.

51:51.718 --> 51:52.636
[exhales]

51:54.305 --> 51:56.226
I'm glad she's dead.

51:59.149 --> 52:01.361
And I hope I had
something to do with it.

52:09.670 --> 52:11.883
[Danielle]
If my Aunt Lisa was here

52:11.966 --> 52:13.928
or my fucking Commander...

52:16.183 --> 52:18.521
[Tyler] If my Commander
were here,

52:19.439 --> 52:20.942
I'd cut his dick off...

52:22.153 --> 52:23.656
make him eat it.

52:25.827 --> 52:26.746
There you go.

52:28.541 --> 52:29.877
[Vicky] The wife...

52:29.960 --> 52:31.964
I'd use a broom handle‐‐

52:32.048 --> 52:33.510
Okay, everyone.

52:33.593 --> 52:34.804
Um...

52:36.306 --> 52:37.893
we've talked about this.

52:39.270 --> 52:41.692
Anger is a valid emotion,

52:41.776 --> 52:45.867
it's, uh, necessary,
important even, to heal.

52:48.288 --> 52:49.917
But we can't live there.

52:51.838 --> 52:53.215
Why not?

52:53.298 --> 52:54.342
June...

52:54.425 --> 52:57.265
Why does healing
have to be the only goal?

52:59.520 --> 53:02.358
Why can't we be as furious
as we feel?

53:04.320 --> 53:05.406
Don't we have that right?

53:08.830 --> 53:11.334
And I think
that's the hour, ladies.

53:12.671 --> 53:14.550
Pick this back up next week.

53:16.469 --> 53:17.556
Thank you.

53:22.064 --> 53:23.860
I'll stay longer
if anyone else wants to.

53:26.239 --> 53:27.158
I'll stick around too.

53:28.995 --> 53:29.997
[Vicky] Me too.

53:30.916 --> 53:31.959
Thank you.

53:33.045 --> 53:34.673
[Tyler] Yeah. Sure.

55:09.070 --> 55:11.074
Luke, I need
to tell you something.

55:15.708 --> 55:19.131
I need to tell you about
the last time I saw Hannah.
