00:43.645 --> 00:45.203
What the hell...

00:51.846 --> 00:54.637
"It was our first month out."

00:54.672 --> 00:56.897
"Winter had set in early."

00:56.932 --> 00:59.389
"We just finished off the last of
the beef-jerky,"

00:59.424 --> 01:02.561
"and I was about to shoot
one of the mules for supper,"

01:02.596 --> 01:05.108
"when Gully started screaming."

01:05.144 --> 01:07.612
"It was the mother lode, all right."

01:07.647 --> 01:10.762
"Most other forty-niners died
broke or hungry,"

01:10.797 --> 01:14.533
"but Gully and me,
we were set for life."

01:14.568 --> 01:16.524
"Funny thing about gold... "

01:16.559 --> 01:19.315
"the metal itself don't change much."

01:19.350 --> 01:23.079
"Heat it up, melt it down,
bury it in the ground..."

01:23.114 --> 01:26.030
"the gold itself never changes."

01:26.065 --> 01:29.296
"Sure changes people, though."

01:31.216 --> 01:33.704
"Old Gully's fortune became my fortune."

01:33.739 --> 01:36.739
"Never spent any of it, except
what it cost to build this house."

01:36.774 --> 01:39.172
"Everybody's wondering
where I hid the gold."

01:39.217 --> 01:42.240
"The truth is it's always been
right here in this house."

01:42.275 --> 01:44.147
"Where is the gold?"

01:45.019 --> 01:48.235
"The answer is in the journals."

01:49.987 --> 01:52.503
- When did you find this?
- A month ago.

01:52.538 --> 01:56.612
It was in that antique,
19th-century satinwood I was restoring.

01:56.647 --> 01:57.771
It was stuck behind a drawer.

01:57.806 --> 01:59.518
A month ago?
Well, why didn't you say anything?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.049
We're supposed to be partners here.

02:01.084 --> 02:03.198
I didn't want to mention it
until I was sure.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.570
Now you're sure?
I mean, this is really authentic?

02:05.605 --> 02:07.143
Yes, Dalton.

02:07.178 --> 02:09.348
That's what I've been doing
on the Internet all month.

02:09.383 --> 02:11.758
That house wasn't easy to find.

02:11.793 --> 02:15.005
This Joshua Skinner really
was a prospector.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.525
He discovered a ton of gold in 1849.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.030
Then his partner disappeared.

02:20.065 --> 02:22.404
Skinner died 30 years later.

02:22.439 --> 02:24.245
They never found the gold.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.582
- How much is it worth?
- Today's market?

02:26.617 --> 02:28.672
Six million, maybe more.

02:28.707 --> 02:30.338
And nobody knows where it is?

02:30.373 --> 02:31.472
It's a mystery.

02:31.507 --> 02:34.270
There never was a clue until now.

02:35.150 --> 02:38.061
He killed his own partner over some gold.

02:38.096 --> 02:40.161
Can you believe it?

02:42.633 --> 02:44.774
As a matter of fact, I can.

02:45.664 --> 02:48.135
MONK Season 2 Epi. 15
Mr. Monk Gets Married

03:43.356 --> 03:45.752
Hello. This is Adrian Monk.

03:45.787 --> 03:47.006
I'm sorry I missed you.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.768
Please leave a message
after you hear the beep.

03:49.803 --> 03:51.273
- Perfect.
- I have to do it again.

03:51.308 --> 03:54.013
- That was great.
- I didn't... I didn't pause after "Hello."

03:54.048 --> 03:57.265
- Yeah, you did. There was a pause.
- I... I don't... I don't think so.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.421
All right. Well, let's play it back.

03:58.456 --> 04:00.625
No, no, no, no, no.
I can do it. I can do it.

04:00.660 --> 04:02.059
One more time. One more.

04:02.094 --> 04:05.420
Adrian, you're wearing
out the digital chip.

04:05.455 --> 04:07.229
What happened to the old machine?

04:07.264 --> 04:10.001
- I spilled some coffee on it.
- And it broke?

04:10.036 --> 04:11.457
No.

04:14.775 --> 04:15.905
Okay. You ready?

04:15.940 --> 04:17.274
Okay.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.616
Wait.

04:24.914 --> 04:26.546
Wait.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.954
Go.

04:30.989 --> 04:32.238
Hello.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.008
This is Adrian Monk.
Sorry I missed you.

04:34.043 --> 04:36.638
Please leave a message
when you hear the beep. - Perfect.

04:36.673 --> 04:39.276
- Oh, I said, "when you hear the beep."
- Well, so what?

04:39.311 --> 04:41.271
I should have said,
"after you hear the beep."

04:41.306 --> 04:42.861
They might start talking during the beep.

04:42.896 --> 04:44.824
No they won't.
Everybody knows there's a beep.

04:44.859 --> 04:47.852
And it doesn't matter anyway, because
nobody calls you except for me, right?

04:47.887 --> 04:49.299
Right.

04:49.334 --> 04:50.946
Wait. We're not ready.

04:50.981 --> 04:51.896
We're not ready.
We gotta...

04:51.931 --> 04:53.380
We're not plugged in.
We gotta plug...

04:53.415 --> 04:56.702
Will you relax?
I'm here. I can answer the phone.

04:56.737 --> 04:58.406
Hello?

04:59.308 --> 05:00.694
Yeah, sure.

05:00.729 --> 05:02.846
Sure, we'll be right down.

05:02.881 --> 05:04.371
Okay. Bye.

05:04.406 --> 05:05.611
That was Disher.

05:05.646 --> 05:06.672
Is it a case?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.860
No. He said it was personal.

05:14.873 --> 05:16.356
Thank you for coming.

05:16.391 --> 05:18.428
Shut the door.

05:21.169 --> 05:22.859
Have you been drinking?

05:22.894 --> 05:24.470
Yes, I have.

05:24.505 --> 05:28.184
Couldn't think of any other way to get
all this scotch into my body.

05:28.219 --> 05:30.360
What's goin' on?

05:30.395 --> 05:31.537
It's my mom.

05:31.572 --> 05:33.798
Oh, my God. Did something happen?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.371
She got married.

05:35.406 --> 05:37.963
Oh. - Oh. Well, congratulations.

05:37.998 --> 05:41.914
She calls me last week and
she says she has a date...

05:41.949 --> 05:44.773
with an antique dealer...
a guy named Dalton Padron.

05:44.808 --> 05:46.700
So, they go out twice.

05:46.735 --> 05:48.860
He proposed to her on their second date.

05:48.895 --> 05:51.349
Wow. - Four days later...

05:51.384 --> 05:53.850
that's yesterday...

05:53.885 --> 05:57.267
they get married at city hall.

05:57.302 --> 06:00.856
Oh, then last night,
when they get back to the hotel,

06:00.891 --> 06:04.040
he tells her that it's not working.

06:04.075 --> 06:06.038
They need counseling.

06:06.073 --> 06:09.010
They're goin' to a therapy clinic,
Monk, for their honeymoon.

06:09.045 --> 06:10.980
Randy, that's not a crime.

06:11.015 --> 06:13.758
No, no, no, no.
Something is up.

06:13.793 --> 06:15.480
He's 37 years old.

06:15.515 --> 06:18.776
She's 58. It doesn't make sense.

06:19.009 --> 06:22.545
Plus, I don't even think
he's playin' for our team.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.915
What do you mean?
What team?

06:25.270 --> 06:30.974
He... He thinks he might be a...
you know... bachelor.

06:31.009 --> 06:33.609
He's not a bachelor.
He just got married.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.089
Haven't you been listening?

06:36.928 --> 06:38.107
Did you check him out?

06:38.142 --> 06:40.115
Yes. He's clean.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.673
Well, maybe he just loves her.

06:45.801 --> 06:47.061
Uh.

06:49.839 --> 06:52.419
Is... Is she rich?

06:52.454 --> 06:55.145
No. That's the thing.

06:55.180 --> 06:56.461
She doesn't have a nickel.

06:56.496 --> 06:58.058
I send her some money every month,

06:58.093 --> 07:01.223
which she spends on bingo
and paintings of Jesus.

07:01.258 --> 07:03.337
I know she's not the prettiest woman
in the world,

07:03.372 --> 07:05.361
but she's my mom,

07:05.396 --> 07:07.586
and I love her.

07:07.621 --> 07:09.814
How could anybody else?

07:09.849 --> 07:10.893
All right.

07:10.928 --> 07:14.506
We'll... We'll... We'll check it out. Okay?

07:14.541 --> 07:16.687
Thank you.

07:16.722 --> 07:19.313
I love you guys.

07:23.742 --> 07:25.332
You have good taste...

07:25.367 --> 07:27.173
a beauty who knows beauty.

07:27.208 --> 07:30.148
This is an original Bergere.
It was actually made in Paris.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.794
I can offer you free delivery.
And I'll tell you why.

07:32.829 --> 07:35.957
It's really the only way I can make sure
I get your address before you leave.

07:35.992 --> 07:38.412
So what do you say?

07:40.028 --> 07:43.062
Wait. Don't stand on that, please.
That chest is a hundred years old.

07:43.097 --> 07:47.911
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just looking at the map.

07:47.946 --> 07:49.525
Yes. It's... Well, it's very rare.

07:49.560 --> 07:54.806
It's a copper-plated engraved map,
hand painted from 1845.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.835
- I don't think so.
- Pardon me?

07:57.870 --> 08:02.500
There was no West Virginia until after
the Civil War,

08:02.535 --> 08:05.996
unless I'm wrong,
which I'm not.

08:06.031 --> 08:07.628
- Really?
- It's a forgery.

08:07.663 --> 08:10.982
You might want to notify the person
who bought it.

08:11.017 --> 08:13.237
Yeah. I'll... I'll be sure to do that.
Thank you.

08:13.272 --> 08:14.124
Uh, excuse me.

08:14.159 --> 08:15.645
Excuse me?

08:16.090 --> 08:18.558
Yes, can you tell me about this armoire?

08:18.593 --> 08:21.311
Yeah. It's, uh, solid teak.

08:21.346 --> 08:23.778
It's turn of the century... or actually,
it's 19th century, sorry.

08:23.813 --> 08:26.668
It's an Indonesian piece.
It's solid teak, as you can see.

08:26.703 --> 08:29.475
Yeah, I'm looking for something like this
for my bedroom but it looks kinda big.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.756
- How tall is it?
- Excuse me. Can I help you?

08:31.791 --> 08:37.419
I... I was in here last... year.

08:37.455 --> 08:39.580
I spoke to your partner. Is he around?

08:39.615 --> 08:42.381
No. Raymond had
some personal problems.

08:42.416 --> 08:45.895
He's disappeared and left me
to run this place all by myself,

08:45.930 --> 08:48.530
which is really why I don't have time
to stand and chat.

08:48.565 --> 08:50.817
So, unless I can help you
with something else...

08:50.852 --> 08:52.025
Oh, no. No.
That's okay.

08:52.060 --> 08:56.288
- We're gonna think about it.
- Okay. Sure.

08:59.165 --> 09:00.989
The lieutenant was right.

09:01.024 --> 09:02.747
This guy is up to something.

09:02.782 --> 09:03.845
How do you know?

09:03.880 --> 09:06.795
There was an application
for a visa on his desk.

09:06.830 --> 09:09.303
He's moving to Ecuador in two weeks.

09:09.338 --> 09:12.826
And under "marital status"
he wrote in "single."

09:12.861 --> 09:16.009
- Who moves to Ecuador?
- People who don't want to come back.

09:16.044 --> 09:18.934
It's almost impossible to get extradited.

09:18.969 --> 09:21.182
What do you think he's up to?

09:21.217 --> 09:22.960
I don't know.

09:23.866 --> 09:27.761
Well, we have to do something.
Randy's falling apart.

09:27.796 --> 09:30.631
I almost feel sorry for him.

09:32.534 --> 09:34.544
What?

09:35.027 --> 09:37.574
I have an idea, but it's a little crazy.

09:37.609 --> 09:39.097
- What is it?
- Promise you'll think about it?

09:39.132 --> 09:42.254
Okay. What the hell are you talking about?

09:42.976 --> 09:45.566
I have to tell you...
I think this is a bad idea.

09:45.601 --> 09:47.907
Why are you saying that?
Because I thought of it?

09:47.942 --> 09:51.536
No, I'm saying that because
I think it's a bad idea.

09:51.919 --> 09:55.370
A lot of marriages are like this bouquet.

09:55.405 --> 09:57.736
Ah. Look at these roses.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.308
Aren't they beautiful?

09:59.343 --> 10:01.347
And everyone admires them.

10:01.382 --> 10:04.564
But they'll be dead before
you leave here Sunday night.

10:04.599 --> 10:06.997
Now let's take a look
at this geranium over here.

10:07.032 --> 10:10.407
No, it's not as pretty as the roses,

10:10.442 --> 10:12.987
but it'll be around for quite a while.

10:13.022 --> 10:15.638
Why? Well, because...

10:15.673 --> 10:18.971
it has... roots.

10:19.006 --> 10:22.193
A good marriage has roots.

10:22.228 --> 10:24.370
They dig down deep.

10:24.405 --> 10:26.450
And the deeper we go,

10:26.485 --> 10:29.110
the stronger we are.

10:29.145 --> 10:30.755
I love that geranium.

10:30.790 --> 10:33.686
And I left it out all last winter.

10:33.721 --> 10:37.585
It can survive anything,
and so can you.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.166
I used to love to garden.

10:39.201 --> 10:40.760
Now we don't even have a windowsill.

10:40.795 --> 10:43.044
Here we go again. Rachel,
we have a perfectly good apartment.

10:43.079 --> 10:45.031
The ants and the cockroaches love it.

10:45.066 --> 10:46.584
We could have been in a house by now.

10:46.619 --> 10:48.805
My brother offered him a great job.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.226
Rachel, I'm not gonna work
for your brother.

10:50.261 --> 10:52.758
He's allergic to success.

10:53.006 --> 10:56.240
Ah-ha. Couple number three.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.942
- You made it.
- Oh, hello, Doctor.

10:58.977 --> 11:01.709
I'm... I'm Sharona,
and this is Adrian.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.796
Of course. Well, we've been
expecting you, Mr. And Mrs. Monk.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.588
Please, come in.

11:06.897 --> 11:09.110
Mr. Monk?

11:09.145 --> 11:10.782
Mrs. Monk?

11:22.704 --> 11:25.379
Well, our little family is complete.

11:25.414 --> 11:27.374
Adrian and Sharona Monk,

11:27.409 --> 11:30.204
this is Jeffrey and Rachel Sweeney...

11:30.239 --> 11:32.698
and Dalton and Maria Padron.

11:32.733 --> 11:37.546
We're going to be shipmates together
on this wonderful voyage.

11:37.581 --> 11:40.341
Gosh, I hope no one gets seasick.

11:40.376 --> 11:43.806
You... the map expert?

11:43.841 --> 11:45.768
You know each other?

11:45.992 --> 11:51.018
Oh, we were in, uh,
Mr. Dalton's antique store. It...

11:51.053 --> 11:54.813
- Small world.
- It certainly is.

11:55.064 --> 11:57.300
Adrian Monk.

11:57.335 --> 12:00.318
Do you know my son, Randy Disher?

12:00.353 --> 12:01.529
No.

12:01.564 --> 12:04.702
No. Does he sell cleaning supplies?
That's what I do.

12:04.737 --> 12:07.410
Mops... and brooms. Mostly brooms.

12:07.445 --> 12:12.877
Sell about... four brooms for every mop.

12:12.912 --> 12:14.853
- It's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.

12:14.888 --> 12:16.653
Yeah. It's... It's spellbinding.

12:16.688 --> 12:19.654
Let's talk about mops and brooms all day.

12:20.957 --> 12:24.244
Oh, well. Um,

12:24.631 --> 12:28.855
That... That's why we're here,
because all he can talk about is work.

12:28.890 --> 12:31.961
Well, that's not the only reason
we're here.

12:33.224 --> 12:34.757
What was that?

12:34.983 --> 12:37.600
Nothing. Just...

12:37.635 --> 12:40.191
Now, I'm going to show
the Monks around,

12:40.226 --> 12:42.651
and while I'm gone I would like
for you to write down...

12:42.686 --> 12:46.009
why you came and what you hope
to accomplish while you're here.

12:46.044 --> 12:48.223
Come on. I'll show you the garden.

12:48.846 --> 12:52.797
Well, I've already had your bags
brought upstairs, and I must say, uh,

12:52.832 --> 12:55.885
I've never had a guest with
so many suitcases.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.713
What was that all about?
I don't drink.

12:57.748 --> 12:59.310
Well, it was... We're undercover.

12:59.345 --> 13:00.883
I had to say something.

13:00.918 --> 13:04.679
Great. Now we have to spend the whole
weekend talking about my drinking problem?

13:04.714 --> 13:07.392
All I said about you was
that you were boring.

13:07.427 --> 13:09.284
- Why can't you be the lush?
- It's too late now.

13:09.319 --> 13:11.453
I already said it. That's our story.
We're stuck with it.

13:11.488 --> 13:13.567
No, we're not. Just tell
them that you were confused

13:13.568 --> 13:15.490
because you're too drunk
'cause you're the lush.

13:15.525 --> 13:17.528
- You're the lush. - You're the lush.
- No, you're the lush.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.932
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoo.

13:20.356 --> 13:23.021
Let's save it for therapy, huh?

13:23.056 --> 13:25.964
I don't think you guys should
miss a single session.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.690
We're in the east wing.

13:28.559 --> 13:29.915
Your house is beautiful.

13:29.950 --> 13:32.185
Oh, it's not mine.
I wish it was.

13:32.220 --> 13:36.222
I'm leasing it from the estate of this man,
Joshua Skinner.

13:36.257 --> 13:38.152
He built this house a hundred
and fifty years ago.

13:38.187 --> 13:40.051
He's one of the few prospectors

13:40.086 --> 13:42.686
in the great gold rush to
actually strike it rich.

13:42.721 --> 13:45.151
That's an unusual desk.

13:45.186 --> 13:48.058
Yeah. I suppose it is.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.144
He and his partner,
a fella named Gully Watson,

13:50.179 --> 13:53.549
found the gold together back
in the winter of '49.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.598
Gully died two weeks later.

13:55.633 --> 13:58.568
He was stung by a bee and
had an allergic reaction.

13:58.603 --> 14:01.098
He was stung by a bee in the winter?

14:01.133 --> 14:03.823
Well, according to Joshua Skinner.

14:03.858 --> 14:05.574
You can read all about it in the library.

14:05.609 --> 14:09.449
He spent the last 15 years of
his life writing his memoirs.

14:09.689 --> 14:10.946
Although I tried reading them.

14:10.981 --> 14:11.883
They were, uh,

14:11.918 --> 14:14.589
Wow. - Mostly gibberish.

14:15.386 --> 14:18.747
Dalton. What are you doing here?

14:18.782 --> 14:20.544
I thought you were finishing
your statement.

14:20.579 --> 14:22.980
Yeah. I-I finished mine.
I was just, uh, lookin' around.

14:23.015 --> 14:25.759
Just sort of a history nut.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.821
These are fascinating.
He's a wonderful writer.

14:31.416 --> 14:35.827
"June 12, 1856. Raining all morning."

14:35.862 --> 14:38.134
"I had beef jerky for breakfast."

14:38.169 --> 14:41.107
"There's a cloud in the sky that
resembles President Pierce."

14:41.142 --> 14:44.862
"This chair is squeaking.
Something smells good."

14:44.897 --> 14:49.163
"I love smoking 'tobaccy.'
I just sneezed."

14:49.198 --> 14:51.472
Not every entry was a masterpiece.

14:51.507 --> 14:54.681
He filled 947 volumes.

14:54.716 --> 14:59.364
I suspect he had a psychological disorder
that compelled him to keep writing.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.583
This guy needed an editor.

15:01.618 --> 15:04.280
He needed a straightjacket.

15:08.417 --> 15:10.298
It's nice.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.515
Where are you gonna sleep?

15:13.550 --> 15:18.048
That is, which side should I take,
darling?

15:18.083 --> 15:22.482
Why don't you just take your
usual side, darling?

15:22.517 --> 15:24.859
Uh, that's what I'll do then, darling.
I'll take my...

15:24.894 --> 15:27.218
I'll take my usual side.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.828
What are you doing?
Don't touch that.

15:32.863 --> 15:34.017
I'll do that.

15:34.052 --> 15:36.533
- You two okay?
- Oh, yeah. We're fine.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.645
We're... We're well.
We're... Thank you.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.026
Okay. Well, I'll let you settle in,

15:41.061 --> 15:44.686
and I'll see you when you come downstairs.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.856
- Thank you.
- You bet.

15:55.404 --> 15:57.439
This ring is too small.

15:57.474 --> 15:59.428
- Where'd you get it?
- It's the only one I could find.

15:59.463 --> 16:01.354
Don't lose it.

16:03.697 --> 16:06.474
There's something strange
about that picture downstairs...

16:06.509 --> 16:08.111
prospector sitting at his desk.

16:08.146 --> 16:12.398
I've seen that desk before
in Dalton's store.

16:12.433 --> 16:15.352
The prospector's desk was
in Dalton's store?

16:15.387 --> 16:16.495
What does that mean?

16:16.530 --> 16:18.792
It means that Dalton is not here
by accident.

16:18.827 --> 16:21.121
Which means that Disher is right.

16:21.156 --> 16:22.819
Dalton is up to something.

16:22.854 --> 16:24.256
- Can't take this thing.
- Whoa, where are you going?

16:24.291 --> 16:25.973
What, what...
Wait. Wait. What are you...

16:26.008 --> 16:28.546
What are you doing? What...

16:28.581 --> 16:30.366
I can't get it off my finger.

16:30.401 --> 16:31.487
I need some soap.

16:31.522 --> 16:33.603
This is my bathroom.

16:34.074 --> 16:35.959
What am I supposed to use?

16:35.994 --> 16:38.051
There's another bathroom downstairs.

16:38.086 --> 16:41.128
Well, how's that gonna look?
We're supposed to be married.

16:41.163 --> 16:45.504
Just hold it in until later,
and then sneak downstairs.

16:45.539 --> 16:46.907
Did you just tell me to "hold it in"?

16:46.942 --> 16:50.341
- Hold it in, please. Please.
- You know what?

16:50.376 --> 16:52.890
You know what?
I really hate being your wife.

16:52.925 --> 16:54.382
I hate it.

16:54.417 --> 16:58.370
I mean, after only 45 minutes,
it's worse than my first marriage.

16:58.405 --> 17:00.171
- Be careful.
- Here. Take it back.

17:00.206 --> 17:04.435
Take it back.
I want a divorce. - Mmm.

17:04.999 --> 17:08.618
Looks like we got our work
cut out for us, huh?

17:08.654 --> 17:12.137
I, uh, forgot to leave your schedule.

17:12.172 --> 17:15.440
- Th-Thanks.
- Oh.

17:16.887 --> 17:18.162
Who's this?

17:18.196 --> 17:21.538
Uh, that's my first wife.
She died six years ago.

17:21.573 --> 17:23.698
Six years ago?

17:23.733 --> 17:27.281
Oh, Adrian, I think obsessing over
your late wife

17:27.316 --> 17:29.264
is the root cause of your problem.

17:29.299 --> 17:32.576
And if Sharona's drinking,
maybe this is the reason, huh?

17:32.611 --> 17:35.261
- Uh, don't. Don't. Wait.
- Doctor, Doctor. Doctor, It's okay.

17:35.296 --> 17:38.047
It's very important to him,
and I really don't mind.

17:38.082 --> 17:39.368
She really doesn't mind.

17:39.403 --> 17:42.816
We're moving forward this weekend,
Adrian, not backwards.

17:42.851 --> 17:44.448
It's time to let go.

17:44.483 --> 17:49.333
I'm going to dedicate this weekend
to helping you forget the past.

17:50.968 --> 17:52.850
- Are you gonna stand?
- I'm fine.

17:52.885 --> 17:54.683
I'm-I'm-I'm fine.
Is that my sandwich?

17:54.718 --> 17:55.806
We're never gonna get away with this.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.650
They're never gonna believe
that we're really married.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.223
We have nothing in common.

17:59.258 --> 18:02.821
I annoy you all the time.
Why wouldn't they believe it?

18:04.259 --> 18:06.178
Did you notice in the library...

18:06.213 --> 18:10.353
Dalton hid something in his pocket?

18:10.388 --> 18:12.413
- Yeah. What was that?
- I don't know.

18:12.448 --> 18:16.005
I think it was a letter. I sure
would like to get a closer look at it.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.378
Adrian, you have to sit.

18:19.413 --> 18:20.681
This is a picnic.

18:20.716 --> 18:23.326
I... I don't sit on the ground.

18:23.361 --> 18:26.159
Animals do things on the ground...

18:26.194 --> 18:28.893
terrible, terrible things.

18:29.753 --> 18:32.569
What if they're watching us?
This is gonna look very weird.

18:32.604 --> 18:35.225
We're supposed to be doing
that outdoor intimacy thing now.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.436
So stand up.

18:37.471 --> 18:39.178
I'm not going to stand up.

18:39.213 --> 18:41.376
This is a picnic.

18:42.891 --> 18:44.723
Sit down.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.586
You stand up.

18:46.832 --> 18:48.671
- You sit down.
- You stand up.

18:48.706 --> 18:50.445
Adrian, sit down!

18:50.480 --> 18:52.720
Okay. Look, all right.

18:55.374 --> 18:56.922
How about this?

18:56.957 --> 19:00.183
How about if we both squat?

19:02.030 --> 19:05.179
See? This is what marriage is.

19:05.214 --> 19:07.978
Marriage is compromise.

19:08.269 --> 19:10.708
She never thought she was beautiful,

19:10.743 --> 19:13.942
which made her even more beautiful.

19:14.695 --> 19:18.629
She was 35 when she died.

19:18.664 --> 19:22.636
She was just starting to get, uh,

19:22.671 --> 19:26.301
some small wrinkles around her eyes.

19:27.034 --> 19:28.789
She hated them.

19:28.824 --> 19:31.464
I loved them. I told her,
"Those are my wrinkles."

19:31.499 --> 19:33.897
I gave them to her...

19:33.932 --> 19:36.780
by making her laugh so much.

19:36.815 --> 19:38.342
You made Trudy laugh?

19:38.377 --> 19:40.620
We laughed all the time.

19:40.655 --> 19:41.932
You two never laugh?

19:41.967 --> 19:45.732
Well, I've never seen him laugh.
Not once.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.979
Oh, Adrian, your wife is in pain.

19:49.014 --> 19:52.773
I think she needs a hug, don't you?

19:54.599 --> 19:56.603
No.

19:56.638 --> 19:59.023
Okay. Then we'll move on.

19:59.058 --> 20:02.350
Let's try a little role reversal. Jeffrey,

20:02.385 --> 20:04.095
why don't you pretend to be Rachel.

20:04.130 --> 20:07.509
- Rachel, you be Jeffrey, and...
- Uh, excuse me.

20:07.544 --> 20:10.534
- What's your problem?
- Me?

20:10.569 --> 20:12.168
What was that look?

20:12.203 --> 20:13.084
What look?

20:13.119 --> 20:14.808
Did you just wink at me?

20:14.843 --> 20:16.155
What?

20:16.190 --> 20:17.460
No. Are you crazy?

20:17.495 --> 20:19.964
W-W-Wait.
You're calling me crazy?

20:19.999 --> 20:21.588
I just saw you wink at me.

20:21.623 --> 20:24.112
- Oh, my God!
- What are you doing?

20:24.147 --> 20:25.839
Aren't you gonna do something about this?

20:25.874 --> 20:26.725
Oh, of course not.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.612
Why should today be any different
than any other day?

20:28.647 --> 20:30.811
Just sit there, and I'll defend
my own honor. Thank you.

20:30.846 --> 20:33.000
Sharona, you're feeling hurt.
I can tell.

20:33.035 --> 20:34.684
Why don't we all just count to 10?

20:34.719 --> 20:37.123
No, no. Stay out of this.
This is between me and Dalton.

20:37.158 --> 20:38.362
I wasn't winking.

20:38.397 --> 20:40.632
Maybe I had somethin' in my eye.
I don't...

20:40.667 --> 20:41.718
Excuse me.

20:41.753 --> 20:45.437
He couldn't be interested in you.
He's not physically able to...

20:45.472 --> 20:46.962
you know... perform.

20:46.997 --> 20:52.676
He stepped on a land mine during
Desert Storm. Tell them.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.575
That's right.

20:57.045 --> 20:59.026
Keep your eyes to yourself!
Keep 'em to yourself!

20:59.061 --> 21:01.240
Settle down. Sit down.

21:01.275 --> 21:03.710
Sit down!
Settle down and sit down.

21:03.745 --> 21:05.020
Now, it's all over.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.449
Everybody gets angry.
It's perfectly normal.

21:07.484 --> 21:11.289
But we cannot allow anger to drive the bus.

21:11.324 --> 21:14.475
Anger has to sit in the back of the bus,
or at the very least,

21:14.510 --> 21:17.559
it needs to stay behind the yellow line.

21:17.594 --> 21:21.569
Because anger is a terrible driver.

21:21.604 --> 21:25.140
"Where is the gold?
The answer is in the journals."

21:25.175 --> 21:27.312
That's why Dalton was reading
all those journals.

21:27.347 --> 21:29.689
And why he married Randy's mother.

21:29.724 --> 21:32.468
He needed a wife to get into this house.

21:32.503 --> 21:34.313
Why didn't he just ask a friend?

21:34.348 --> 21:37.903
I don't know. He obviously
didn't wanna share the money.

21:37.938 --> 21:40.766
Oh, poor Maria.
She really loves him.

21:40.801 --> 21:42.246
What should we do?

21:42.281 --> 21:44.022
We don't have a choice.

21:44.057 --> 21:46.728
We're gonna have to show her this.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.058
What are you doin' here?

21:51.093 --> 21:52.511
We're just talkin'.

21:52.546 --> 21:54.742
No, I mean here at this clinic.

21:54.777 --> 21:58.285
Well, Sharona and I have been
drifting apart lately.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.185
Yeah, we're... we're tryin' to rekindle
the spark we had when we were dating.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.894
Picking somebody's pocket is
a crime, Mrs. Monk.

22:04.929 --> 22:08.981
She didn't.
It fell out of your jacket.

22:09.016 --> 22:11.033
It's just an old letter I found upstairs.

22:11.068 --> 22:14.543
It's just crazy talk about
a cache of hidden gold.

22:14.578 --> 22:18.979
Really? - Yeah. It's just a rumor...
an old wives' tale.

22:19.014 --> 22:22.825
Yeah, but I'd hate for Maria
to see this, though,

22:22.860 --> 22:25.761
'cause she might think it's
why I brought her here.

22:25.796 --> 22:27.495
It might upset her...

22:27.530 --> 22:30.433
a very fragile person, you know.

22:33.747 --> 22:35.830
Just one more thing, Adrian.

22:35.865 --> 22:38.578
If you or your wife tangle with me again,

22:38.613 --> 22:40.347
you won't know what hit you.

22:40.382 --> 22:42.940
Well, I'll have a rough idea.

22:44.288 --> 22:47.383
I knew this tent would come in handy.

22:48.614 --> 22:50.772
Why don't we just tell Maria
what we know?

22:50.807 --> 22:53.806
She won't believe us... not without proof.

22:53.841 --> 22:55.193
Why would she? I'm a...

22:55.228 --> 22:57.037
I'm a cowardly mop salesman,

22:57.072 --> 23:00.095
and you're my crazy, alcoholic wife
who attacked her husband.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.633
Well, we should at least call Randy.
She'd believe her own son.

23:02.668 --> 23:04.489
She hasn't believed him so far.

23:04.524 --> 23:06.293
- What are you doing?
- This shelf.

23:06.328 --> 23:09.078
I can't sleep with a crooked shelf
in the room.

23:09.113 --> 23:12.150
Well, when you turn off the light
you won't see it.

23:12.972 --> 23:16.086
I wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

23:16.121 --> 23:18.651
You live in a dreamworld.

23:57.499 --> 23:58.825
Sharona.

23:58.860 --> 24:00.740
Go away.

24:02.345 --> 24:03.474
What is it?

24:03.509 --> 24:05.378
Get your camera.

24:12.152 --> 24:14.171
- I'm goin' in.
- You can't.

24:14.206 --> 24:15.983
No. You can't.

24:16.018 --> 24:18.999
Adrian, I have to go in.
Randy's depending on us.

24:19.034 --> 24:22.139
I promise I'll be careful.
I'm just gonna take a few pictures.

24:22.174 --> 24:23.853
Don't worry.

24:23.888 --> 24:27.053
I... I don't know how to not worry.

24:27.088 --> 24:28.849
Stay there.

24:47.553 --> 24:48.713
What are you doing?

24:48.748 --> 24:51.089
There's a coyote out there.

24:51.354 --> 24:52.818
Oh, my God.
You're in a cave.

24:52.853 --> 24:55.199
I can't believe it.
I am so proud of you.

24:55.234 --> 24:56.912
Thank you. Let's go.

24:56.947 --> 24:58.520
Okay, okay.
I think Dalton went that way.

24:58.555 --> 25:01.887
And I could not care less.

25:01.922 --> 25:06.010
Sharona, I have g-got to get out of here.

25:06.045 --> 25:09.524
I... I can feel myself... going numb.

25:09.559 --> 25:10.913
Okay. Okay, we're leaving. Here.

25:10.948 --> 25:13.554
Follow me this way. This way.

25:14.257 --> 25:15.963
- Can I open my eyes?
- No, no, no. Not yet.

25:15.998 --> 25:17.929
We're almost there.

25:22.637 --> 25:23.532
What?

25:23.567 --> 25:25.992
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God.

25:26.435 --> 25:28.651
- Put your head down.!
- What's happening?

25:34.763 --> 25:35.937
Now don't worry.

25:35.972 --> 25:37.487
Once they realize that we're gone,

25:37.522 --> 25:39.381
They're gonna start looking for us.

25:39.416 --> 25:41.168
They'll never find us.

25:41.203 --> 25:45.657
Look, my camera has
a built-in flash, okay?

25:45.692 --> 25:51.091
Gonna use the light to try and
find the entrance, okay? - Okay.

25:51.126 --> 25:52.401
You ready? - Uh-huh.

25:52.436 --> 25:53.844
Okay. Here we go.

25:58.460 --> 25:59.821
Okay.! It's over here.!

25:59.856 --> 26:01.915
It's over here. Come on.

26:01.950 --> 26:03.462
Come on.

26:05.256 --> 26:08.534
Okay. Come on.

26:09.410 --> 26:11.876
- You know who I miss?
- Who?

26:11.911 --> 26:13.876
The coyote.

26:15.396 --> 26:17.526
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

26:17.561 --> 26:19.568
Oh, here it is!
Here it is.

26:19.603 --> 26:20.990
I feel the rocks.

26:21.025 --> 26:22.153
Hello!

26:22.188 --> 26:24.075
Anybody there?

26:24.110 --> 26:25.322
Help.!

26:25.357 --> 26:26.634
Oh, no.

26:26.669 --> 26:30.708
We're gonna have to dig.
I got a penknife in my pocket.

26:31.132 --> 26:33.528
Shoot!

26:33.563 --> 26:36.064
I dropped it!

26:41.768 --> 26:43.522
You have a flashlight?

26:43.557 --> 26:46.013
- On my key chain.
- Why didn't you say anything?

26:46.048 --> 26:48.947
It's only for emergencies.

26:50.595 --> 26:51.905
Shine it...

26:51.940 --> 26:53.401
Sharona. - What?

26:53.436 --> 26:55.938
- Can I have the ring back?
- What ring?

26:55.973 --> 26:57.370
The ring I loaned you.

26:57.405 --> 27:00.255
I-I-I'd like to hold on to it.

27:09.136 --> 27:11.902
This is Trudy's wedding ring, isn't it?

27:11.937 --> 27:15.093
I wanna have it with me in case...

27:15.128 --> 27:17.989
- Hey, hey.
- You know, we don't, uh...

27:18.024 --> 27:20.840
Nobody's gonna die.

27:23.137 --> 27:25.159
Hold this.

27:26.183 --> 27:29.682
You know, before I was your assistant,

27:29.717 --> 27:31.542
I was your nurse.

27:31.577 --> 27:32.865
And you know what?

27:32.900 --> 27:35.016
That means I'm still your nurse.

27:35.051 --> 27:37.569
So I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you,

27:37.604 --> 27:39.480
and you wanna know why?

27:39.515 --> 27:42.390
'Cause it'll look bad on my resume.

27:46.422 --> 27:47.864
Hello?

27:47.899 --> 27:51.408
Can't talk now.
I'm trapped in a cave.

27:52.086 --> 27:55.337
Wha...

27:59.185 --> 28:02.142
Mr. And Mrs. Monk, how you folks doin'?

28:02.177 --> 28:05.095
I found some more of those towelette
things. - Thank you.

28:05.130 --> 28:08.006
I've been pokin' around down there
at the site of the accident.

28:08.041 --> 28:09.424
That was no accident.

28:09.459 --> 28:14.237
Now, did you actually see this Dalton
Padron knock that support beam out?

28:14.272 --> 28:15.175
No.

28:15.210 --> 28:18.041
That beam is about a hundred
and fifty years old.

28:18.076 --> 28:20.532
It was bound to give way sometime.

28:20.567 --> 28:24.550
If I make it to a hundred and fifty,
I expect I'll feel the same.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.100
- Hello?
- Hey, are you guys all right?

28:31.135 --> 28:32.356
What was all that about a cave?

28:32.391 --> 28:35.522
Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry.
We're fine. It... It was nothing.

28:35.557 --> 28:37.993
Was it some sort of therapy thing?

28:38.028 --> 28:40.376
Yes, Randy.
It's called "cave therapy."

28:40.411 --> 28:43.847
Listen. I got your message
about my stepfather.

28:43.882 --> 28:46.025
God, I hate calling him that.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.566
Has anything else turned up?

28:47.601 --> 28:49.874
Nothing we can prove.

28:49.909 --> 28:52.602
Okay. Maybe I've got
somethin' on this end.

28:52.637 --> 28:55.229
You remember Dalton's partner,
Raymond Toliver?

28:55.264 --> 28:57.173
Well, guess what?
Raymond's disappeared.

28:57.208 --> 28:59.380
His brother just filed
a missing persons report.

28:59.415 --> 29:01.256
I'm gonna go check this out.
Keep me posted, okay?

29:01.291 --> 29:03.085
Okay. We'll call you later.

29:03.614 --> 29:05.701
What is it?

29:06.343 --> 29:09.007
We've gotta get back.
This might be bigger than we thought.

29:09.042 --> 29:11.918
You know, there are many kinds
of cave-ins.

29:11.953 --> 29:14.122
There are real cave-ins,

29:14.157 --> 29:17.707
and then there are emotional...
cave-ins.

29:17.742 --> 29:19.554
What were you doing there anyway?

29:19.589 --> 29:21.032
Oh, we were just exploring.

29:21.067 --> 29:22.946
We're amateur spelunkers.

29:22.981 --> 29:24.893
We were spelunking.

29:24.928 --> 29:27.966
We love it... spelunking around.

29:28.001 --> 29:29.605
Did you find anything interesting?

29:29.640 --> 29:30.996
Not yet.

29:31.031 --> 29:32.529
Did you?

29:33.009 --> 29:34.975
Adrian, Sharona,

29:35.010 --> 29:37.897
while you were out,
I happened to look into your room,

29:37.932 --> 29:40.097
and I couldn't help but notice that

29:40.132 --> 29:44.494
Sharona is sleeping in a pup tent
on the floor.

29:44.529 --> 29:50.366
The photo of your late wife is in a place of
honor... on the mantel above the fireplace,

29:50.401 --> 29:54.240
while your current wife is sleeping
on the floor.

29:54.275 --> 29:55.989
Dear God, I...

29:56.024 --> 29:58.498
I don't know where to begin.

29:59.391 --> 30:03.978
Adrian, Sharona,
you loved each other once.

30:04.013 --> 30:07.118
You wouldn't be wearing those rings
if you didn't, right?

30:07.153 --> 30:08.643
Right.

30:10.895 --> 30:16.035
Adrian, Sharona,
I want you to look at each other,

30:16.070 --> 30:20.684
and I want you to say, "I love you."

30:20.719 --> 30:22.320
And don't just say the words.

30:22.355 --> 30:24.127
Feel the words.

30:24.162 --> 30:25.653
Go ahead.

30:30.726 --> 30:32.678
I love you.

30:37.401 --> 30:39.230
I love you.

30:39.265 --> 30:40.788
That was very good.

30:40.823 --> 30:42.806
Now...

30:43.658 --> 30:46.221
I want you to kiss.

30:46.256 --> 30:48.060
And not just any kiss.

30:48.095 --> 30:52.799
I want you to communicate everything
that you mean to each other...

30:52.834 --> 30:55.454
and all of what you hope for.

30:55.489 --> 30:57.515
Go ahead.

30:57.550 --> 31:01.543
Eh, we...

31:01.578 --> 31:03.397
don't kiss.

31:03.432 --> 31:05.235
Yeah, it's...

31:05.270 --> 31:07.923
just not our style.

31:07.958 --> 31:13.495
Well, then your new life begins
right here, right now.

31:18.229 --> 31:20.152
Go ahead.

31:21.055 --> 31:23.825
Kiss.

31:40.497 --> 31:42.612
Oh, that was so nice.

31:47.259 --> 31:50.389
Now, that's just insulting.

31:50.424 --> 31:52.880
We're gonna need more mouthwash.

31:54.786 --> 31:56.022
Here we go.

31:56.057 --> 31:58.172
Ooh, the old journals...
you stole them from the library?

31:58.207 --> 32:00.476
Nobody will miss them.

32:00.511 --> 32:01.866
Let's just start reading.

32:01.901 --> 32:03.183
What are we looking for, a map?

32:03.218 --> 32:06.350
A map or a clue. Something.

32:06.385 --> 32:10.473
If Dalton finds that gold before we do,
he's gone forever.

32:10.508 --> 32:14.479
- He's heading for Ecuador, remember?
- Yeah. Here, sit down.

32:14.514 --> 32:16.323
No way.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.984
There's a bench.

32:19.019 --> 32:21.435
I mean, I can understand your not
wanting to sit down on the ground,

32:21.470 --> 32:24.158
but I've seen you sit on a bench before.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.194
No, no, no. Not this one.

32:25.229 --> 32:29.259
Yesterday, when we arrived,
there was a bird on it.

32:29.868 --> 32:31.616
You're impossible.

32:31.651 --> 32:34.216
You married me.
Just keep reading.

32:34.251 --> 32:38.139
Now that you mentioned it,
I haven't seen Mr. Toliver around...

32:38.174 --> 32:39.845
not for a week or two.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.401
Although, I'm just the landlord.
I'm not their mother.

32:42.436 --> 32:43.843
Yes, sir.

32:44.058 --> 32:45.694
Aren't you supposed to have a warrant?

32:45.729 --> 32:48.857
Aren't you supposed to have
a sprinkler system that works?

32:50.408 --> 32:51.449
Thank you.

32:51.484 --> 32:54.039
Will you step back, please?
I'll just be a minute.

32:54.074 --> 32:57.256
"I wonder if anyone's ever really
been knocked over by a feather."

32:57.291 --> 32:59.816
"It would have to be a pretty big bird."

32:59.851 --> 33:01.174
You know what's in this one?

33:01.209 --> 33:03.881
He copied the first
three books of the Bible.

33:03.916 --> 33:07.644
- Word for word.
- This guy's certifiable.

33:07.679 --> 33:09.442
Sure he's not related to you?

33:09.477 --> 33:10.500
That's funny.

33:10.535 --> 33:12.231
That's funny.
Keep reading.

33:12.266 --> 33:15.351
You remember what the letter said:
"The answer is in the journals."

33:15.386 --> 33:17.104
It must be some kind of code.

33:17.139 --> 33:21.706
"There is a chicken in Mexico
who can play tic-tac-toe"?

33:21.741 --> 33:23.181
Keep reading. Come on.

33:23.216 --> 33:24.559
Keep reading.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.284
What are you doing?

33:43.319 --> 33:46.051
You've been reading all weekend.

33:46.086 --> 33:48.073
What's so interesting about
these books anyway?

33:48.108 --> 33:48.918
Maria, don't do this.

33:48.953 --> 33:51.352
I told you on our wedding night,
it's never gonna happen.

33:51.387 --> 33:53.302
It's physically impossible.

33:53.337 --> 33:56.051
Yeah, but I believe in miracles.

33:56.086 --> 33:59.671
Maria, you're just embarrassing
yourself... again.

34:07.681 --> 34:10.779
"Bought a grandfather clock today
for the front hall."

34:10.813 --> 34:13.096
"Keeps perfect time.
It's worth its weight in gold."

34:13.130 --> 34:14.984
"I love it so m..."

34:17.129 --> 34:19.744
"Worth its weight in gold"?

34:34.822 --> 34:37.545
- Hello?
- Mom, are you okay?

34:37.580 --> 34:38.795
Am I okay?

34:38.830 --> 34:40.428
Mom, listen to me.

34:40.463 --> 34:42.702
I want you to get out of there right now.

34:42.737 --> 34:44.934
Dalton murdered his partner.

34:44.969 --> 34:46.496
Mom...

34:48.235 --> 34:50.607
Is he there?

34:57.548 --> 34:59.057
Is this Sheriff Mathis?

34:59.092 --> 35:01.966
This is Lieutenant Randall Disher
from the San Francisco Police.

35:02.001 --> 35:05.492
I need you to detain a suspect
in a homicide... a Dalton Padron.

35:05.527 --> 35:07.946
He's at the Waterford Institute.
Do you know where that is?

35:07.981 --> 35:09.510
Good.
Don't leave.

35:09.545 --> 35:13.258
Nobody gets in or out of this building
till Captain Stottlemeyer gets here.

35:16.190 --> 35:17.992
I think I've already read this one.

35:18.027 --> 35:19.859
No. No, you didn't.

35:19.894 --> 35:23.539
- A couple of them are identical.
- Oh, God.

35:24.357 --> 35:27.465
- That's it. I'm goin' to bed.
- You can't.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.190
- We still have all these left to do.
- I'll wait for the movie.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.425
Wake me up if you find any gold.

35:35.460 --> 35:37.622
Good night.

35:42.132 --> 35:44.198
What is it?

35:44.864 --> 35:46.769
The answer.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.105
What?

35:49.140 --> 35:51.219
That's what Skinner said in his letter:

35:51.254 --> 35:52.946
"Where is the gold?"

35:52.981 --> 35:57.349
"The answer is... in the journals."

36:06.167 --> 36:08.983
This book must be over 600 pages,

36:09.018 --> 36:11.046
but the journal weighs more.

36:11.081 --> 36:13.896
The book covers are made of gold.

36:13.931 --> 36:18.164
No. No, it's leather.
It's ordinary leather.

36:18.199 --> 36:20.923
Where is the gold?

36:21.907 --> 36:24.878
The answer isn't in the journals.

36:24.913 --> 36:31.337
The answer is, "In the journals."

36:46.907 --> 36:49.576
You're wasting your time, Mr. Padron.

36:49.611 --> 36:51.971
The gold's not there.
I know where it is.

36:52.006 --> 36:55.506
Dalton Padron, I'm Ronald Mathis
of the Hillside County Sheriff's Office.

36:55.541 --> 36:58.108
I want you to put that hammer down.

36:58.302 --> 37:01.178
Sir, you drop your hammer...

37:01.950 --> 37:04.136
Or I'll drop mine.

37:04.171 --> 37:07.978
Joshua Skinner's fortune was right here...

37:08.013 --> 37:11.556
under our noses the whole time.

37:11.591 --> 37:15.388
"The answer is in the journals."

37:15.423 --> 37:17.693
- Which one?
- All of'em.

37:20.232 --> 37:21.431
Gold paper?

37:21.466 --> 37:23.564
Gold... ink.

37:23.599 --> 37:25.279
Ink?

37:36.053 --> 37:38.712
Joshua Skinner didn't trust banks.

37:38.747 --> 37:41.918
So he decided to hide
his illegitimate fortune.

37:41.953 --> 37:43.889
He melted down the gold,

37:43.924 --> 37:46.367
mixed in a little black ink...

37:46.402 --> 37:49.358
any amateur chemist could have done it

37:49.393 --> 37:51.257
and then he began to write.

37:51.292 --> 37:53.682
And write and write and write and write.

37:53.717 --> 37:55.258
It was mostly nonsense,

37:55.293 --> 37:58.503
gibberish, really...
anything that popped into his head.

37:58.538 --> 38:02.279
He ran out of things to talk about
after five pages,

38:02.314 --> 38:05.524
but he just kept on writing.

38:05.559 --> 38:08.856
The gold was hidden in plain sight,

38:08.891 --> 38:14.338
and it stayed hidden for a hundred
and twenty-five years...

38:20.083 --> 38:22.548
Until tonight.

38:22.583 --> 38:25.630
Wow. You figure 30 ounces of
gold per journal.

38:25.665 --> 38:28.875
That's roughly $6,000 a book,
947 volumes...

38:28.910 --> 38:33.046
that's $6 million... more or less.

38:33.081 --> 38:35.200
Hm. Don't forget the real price.

38:35.235 --> 38:37.059
Two people died for that gold.

38:37.094 --> 38:38.210
Two people?

38:38.245 --> 38:41.457
Dalton had a business partner...
a partner who trusted him.

38:41.492 --> 38:43.897
A lot of people trusted him.

38:43.932 --> 38:45.946
Dalton, is it true?

38:45.981 --> 38:47.745
Well, what can I say, darling?

38:47.780 --> 38:49.840
That's a lot of gold.

38:51.664 --> 38:54.338
This weekend just will not end.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.507
Dalton, if you, uh...

38:55.542 --> 38:57.730
if you want a hostage, take me.

38:57.765 --> 38:59.893
Well, that's awfully sweet, Jeffrey.
No, thank you.

38:59.928 --> 39:02.295
The only thing I'm taking from
this house is my new gun.

39:02.330 --> 39:05.137
And the keys to these handcuffs.
Come on.

39:05.172 --> 39:07.196
And a little reading material. Let's go!

39:12.323 --> 39:13.746
Come on. Let's go.

39:27.645 --> 39:29.149
Oh, my God. Oh, could...

39:29.184 --> 39:32.202
could everybody step back?
He's claustrophobic.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.164
Move, move, move.

39:36.345 --> 39:38.218
Great! The battery's dead.
Of course.

39:38.253 --> 39:39.849
Just relax.

39:39.884 --> 39:41.969
It'll just be a few minutes...

39:42.004 --> 39:43.986
And everybody's safe.

39:44.021 --> 39:45.521
That's the important thing.

39:45.556 --> 39:47.280
And we're all together.

39:47.315 --> 39:50.344
Ah, yes. We are.
We're all together. - Mmm.

39:50.379 --> 39:52.677
You know, in a way, we're lucky.

39:52.712 --> 39:55.689
Not all marriages are
ever tested like this.

39:55.724 --> 40:01.895
So maybe we should take advantage
of this situation and really explore...

40:03.370 --> 40:05.301
Forget it.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.529
- You really would have gone with him?
- I'd do anything for you.

40:08.564 --> 40:11.454
Don't you know that, Rachel?
You're my whole world.

40:11.489 --> 40:13.388
You know, I've been thinkin'.

40:13.423 --> 40:16.119
I'm... I am gonna talk to your brother
about that job.

40:16.154 --> 40:18.054
- Oh, I love you, Jeff.
- Oh, God.

40:18.089 --> 40:21.272
- I love you, baby.
- No, no, no. No, don't...

40:21.483 --> 40:23.563
I don't think we've been introduced.

40:23.598 --> 40:26.136
I-I'm Ronald.

40:26.763 --> 40:29.194
I'm Maria.

40:44.954 --> 40:46.002
Don't move!

40:46.037 --> 40:47.620
Show me your hands.

40:47.655 --> 40:50.369
Where the hell's my mother,
you son of a bitch?

40:50.845 --> 40:51.648
Mom!

40:52.386 --> 40:53.187
Mom?

40:53.222 --> 40:55.187
- What took you so long?
- Are you all right?

40:55.222 --> 40:57.728
Oh, Randy. Randy.

40:57.763 --> 40:59.755
Mom, are you okay?

41:01.755 --> 41:03.366
What day is it?

41:03.401 --> 41:06.556
We were only in there for five minutes.

41:06.591 --> 41:08.518
I don't think so.

41:10.835 --> 41:13.266
Six million dollars.

41:13.301 --> 41:15.075
Who's gonna get all that money?

41:15.110 --> 41:16.986
Well, I just spoke to the D. A.

41:17.021 --> 41:19.994
Skinner's old partner,
Gully, is the rightful heir.

41:20.029 --> 41:21.885
He's got some family nearby,

41:21.920 --> 41:24.666
and they are in for one pretty surprise.

41:24.701 --> 41:26.448
There's my hero.

41:26.483 --> 41:31.486
- I'm not a hero, Mom.
- You are a hero to me.

41:36.164 --> 41:38.229
Thank you, Sheriff.

41:38.264 --> 41:39.854
My car's right here,
whenever you're ready.

41:39.889 --> 41:42.866
Well, honey,
I think Ron's gonna drive me home.

41:42.901 --> 41:46.591
I'll call you in the morning.
Love you.

41:46.626 --> 41:48.647
Love you too.

41:51.425 --> 41:52.750
In the morning?

41:52.785 --> 41:55.329
You can't even get your own mother
to go home with you.

41:55.364 --> 41:57.626
Hey, what do you say, on the way home,
we stop and look at a condo?

41:57.661 --> 42:00.900
- Condo?
- Hey, one step at a time.

42:02.270 --> 42:05.802
Here. I think this is yours.

42:06.155 --> 42:08.620
Thanks for letting me wear it.

42:08.867 --> 42:10.939
Adrian, Sharona.

42:10.974 --> 42:12.949
I'm glad you're still here.

42:13.467 --> 42:15.851
There's something that
I've been meaning to say.

42:15.886 --> 42:17.528
Marriage is very hard,

42:17.563 --> 42:21.645
and it takes exceptional people
to make it work.

42:21.680 --> 42:24.527
But I think you two can do it.

42:24.562 --> 42:28.758
I believe in Adrian and Sharona.

42:28.793 --> 42:31.410
Thanks a lot, uh, but...

42:31.445 --> 42:32.859
I think you should know,

42:32.894 --> 42:34.929
we're...
we're not really married.

42:34.964 --> 42:36.057
Oh, thank God.

42:36.092 --> 42:38.389
Ha! Good.
Keep it that way, huh?

42:38.424 --> 42:39.452
- Okay, we will.
- Thank you.

42:39.487 --> 42:41.439
No problem there.
