- Commander?
- It's full with Steam, sir!

Hey, idiot...
General Trajano requests your report for the service!

07:54.140 --> 07:55.756

07:56.393 --> 07:58.225
Raise it up.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.455

08:23.003 --> 08:25.541
Commander Bishop, are

<i>Bishop...</i>

09:03.626 --> 09:06.289
It'll be good to see you again
in your uniform, Bishop.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.002
Who says I'm going to put it?

09:16.598 --> 09:20.182
Come on, we both know,
you're not a deserter.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.305
Find another, for your murders.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.645
You made an oath on Spartan-7.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.614
Take off your uniform, do
not remove the promise.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.863
Come on, then, arrest me.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.112
All my oaths were
broken long ago.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.115
Sorry for Mara.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.786
She was a good woman.
It is difficult to deal with such a thing.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.336
Especially today.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.373
That's why I brought you here, son.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.090
It's time to get Mara closer.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.224
We told you that your baby died.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.435
I wish it would have been so.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.764
That would be better than the truth.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.062
Ash-393 took it from the
womb of your broken wife.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.114
He took it with him.
No one knows where.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.037
We could not tell you the
truth that time, but...

10:20.038 --> 10:23.691
But if he had left, a Noid
kidnapped a human baby...

10:23.692 --> 10:26.703
We would have genocidal
panic above our heads.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.289
You're telling me?...

10:30.088 --> 10:31.875
That my son still lives?

10:32.549 --> 10:38.341
Yes, Bishop. But the most important:
We're giving you a chance to get them back.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.968
Find Ash.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.717
Then you will find your daughter.

10:45.728 --> 10:50.223
<i>My daughter...
Our daughter, Mara!</i>

10:51.693 --> 10:53.935
<i>Five years have passed.</i>

10:54.571 --> 10:57.154
<i>How could he survive on the ice for so long?</i>

10:58.324 --> 11:00.816
<i>She does not have improved DNA.</i>

11:08.168 --> 11:11.473
<i>Extension of DNA at the end of mitosis...</i>

11:12.179 --> 11:15.085
<i>... sequencing the completed genetic material.</i>

<i>No human survives without Iso-Gel
one day less than 60 degrees.</i>

11:20.305 --> 11:22.797
<i>Could she really be alive?</i>

11:26.728 --> 11:31.814
<i>Alert! F-7100 to the maximum ..</i>

11:43.494 --> 11:46.953
<i>Reprogramming of
DNA is complete.</i>

11:47.624 --> 11:51.288
<i>Markers identified for
strength and healing.</i>

11:52.253 --> 11:56.372
<i>I think to resurrect a broken man,
I suppose everything is possible.</i>

12:03.223 --> 12:05.135
<i>They brought me back, Mara.</i>

12:05.767 --> 12:07.850
<i>To the place I never thought to return.</i>

12:08.353 --> 12:10.310
<i>Spartan-7...</i>

12:10.897 --> 12:13.264
<i>... slave police.</i>

12:36.464 --> 12:38.330
Ishmael...

12:44.847 --> 12:48.215
What happened brother?
You never came with me for help.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.017
Ready for this?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.818
I do not know, Ish.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.709
Come on, Commander!
Your team is waiting for you

13:24.137 --> 13:26.909
<i>All members of the UCF
crew have arrived...</i>

13:26.910 --> 13:31.968
Ash-393 is considered to be the most
sophisticated noid ever created by men.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.230
A class one surface
humanoid 300 Series.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.723
It has full AI access.

13:37.724 --> 13:40.351
He was the leader of Noid's rebellion.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.943
He was.
Is dead.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.417
By rumors has many crimes In
the Federation of Arizona,

13:49.218 --> 13:52.279
He recently arrived in the northeast corridor.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.623
The reactor 12 has been turned off.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.450
He killed 28.

13:56.753 --> 14:00.212
Hidden by intelligence, it
is in the death zone 714.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.882
Hidden in the death zone?
Does not sound very clever

14:06.387 --> 14:10.051
The fusion of the nucleus has probably
smoothed the brain of the Noids.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.633
Or, Commander?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.223
Not as soft as your dick.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.557
Revenge is a bitch...
Like you!

14:19.859 --> 14:21.395
What, Kix?

14:21.944 --> 14:23.355
Stop him!

14:23.780 --> 14:26.648
Five years ago I got a
team sent to kill Ash.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.066
We lost contact here.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.406
There temperatures must be subarctic.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.451
Your Iso-Gel will last 48 hours.

14:34.957 --> 14:39.918
After that your thermal protection will
increase by 1% per hour of exposure.

14:40.171 --> 14:43.164
So, do we have four days, before
we make ourselves palettes?

14:43.341 --> 14:44.752
You will not need much, son.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.210
- One question, General.
- What is it, Kix?

14:47.470 --> 14:50.383
What range is recommended
for some after freezing.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.007
Can I calm him down?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.846
And bury him in the snow?

14:56.270 --> 14:59.013
It has more deaths than
you have wet dreams.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.064
They are in perfectly capable hands.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.853
But that's a long time ago, General.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.519
Before qVapor has fried his gray matter.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.356
Commander Bishop...

15:09.325 --> 15:11.066
... you have the floor.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.552
Weapon systems...

15:35.685 --> 15:36.846
... what we have?

15:36.853 --> 15:39.596
Each stay in the team art piece in the man

15:39.856 --> 15:42.644
Sources of energy, sonar
grenades, radon guns.

15:42.859 --> 15:47.069
Enough firepower for everyone to
melt ice cubes in the death zone...

15:50.241 --> 15:54.906
Know the magnetic field,
That the meteor has caused.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.614
Why did we ever put electronic
weapons there anyway?

15:59.333 --> 16:04.499
Intelligence has new information about
the magnetic field in the death zone.

16:04.672 --> 16:10.919
Their wrist weapons have been modified
and operate within the death zone.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.477
I'd like to order five carabinier rifles.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.270
3,000 cartridges of ammunition

16:22.648 --> 16:24.230
And 50 thermal grenades.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.774
For backup, sir.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.144
I like the sound, Commander.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.955
<i>said it used to be one of the
hottest deserts on earth...</i>

16:46.672 --> 16:51.918
<i>But 500 miles of radio alive this
tundra became "Death Zone 714".</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:56.680
<i>I guess hell finally froze.</i>

17:26.002 --> 17:28.540
Again, search for the
needle in the haystack.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.417
You just have to love it.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.669
I do not understand that. After
five years it can be everywhere.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.928
Why did they wait so long
until they sent us, anyway?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.970
Procrastination is like masturbation:

17:42.144 --> 17:45.512
At first it feels good...

17:45.898 --> 17:48.641
... but in the end you just catch yourself.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.909
I've got all the
data out, Commander!

18:07.503 --> 18:10.337
I'm a backup person,
nasty killer machine!

18:11.215 --> 18:13.753
I do not need no hand,
to kill a Noid.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.753
Because you've never seen one of
those things take the man's arm.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.716
You said it!

18:19.181 --> 18:21.673
If so my kill rate goes
high, I like that.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.976
I know the reports
on AI systems.

18:25.313 --> 18:28.897
The majority of patients are
10 years after implantation.

18:29.275 --> 18:33.235
So you have no
problem, you're wrong.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.118
Sorry for all the shit about
the death of your wife, sir.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.490
Between us, this mission
is not about Noids.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.914
Is personal.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.285
We are his devilish dogs...
And we come back healthy!

18:51.505 --> 18:55.249
Hey Bishop, what are you doing?
Shaving your legs?

18:55.843 --> 19:00.838
If we do not have more energy and your
blaster has become shiny black cock

19:02.516 --> 19:04.178
What do you do then?

19:05.394 --> 19:07.386
Then I put the bastard in the ass!

19:31.671 --> 19:34.459
I caught something
warm, behind the snow.

19:34.499 --> 19:36.006
Okay, Kix.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.673
- Warm the gun!
- Your best idea so far!

19:39.679 --> 19:42.467
Kix waits for my signal.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.929
- You're the boss, Commander!
- Go to your last team!

19:47.228 --> 19:49.345
I thought this noid could fly.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.139
Hatta, do not continue.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.354
We need to know, who
is under the blanket.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.396
I do not want to kill any innocent.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.985
<i>This is the Commander Bishop,</i>

20:47.621 --> 20:50.238
<i>Spartan-7 Humanoid Command.</i>

20:50.875 --> 20:54.960
<i>You are located in the Federation area.
In the death zone 714.</i>

20:55.171 --> 20:56.582
<i>What have you lost here?</i>

20:58.799 --> 21:02.469
<i>Under the authorization code
of the Federation Z-4711</i>

21:02.470 --> 21:04.938
<i>A report of the
genome documentation.</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:07.096
<i>You have five seconds to meet.</i>

21:08.642 --> 21:10.053
Five...

21:11.312 --> 21:12.598
<i>... four...</i>

21:14.190 --> 21:15.522
<i>...three...</i>

21:17.568 --> 21:19.150
<i>...two...</i>

21:20.613 --> 21:22.730
<i>...one...!</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:38.607
The target moves,
permission to shoot!

21:38.608 --> 21:39.971
Permission denied Kix.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.422
We have no idea who he is.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.299
We reached it on foot.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.548
I'm going to take his death.

21:51.101 --> 21:54.185
Stop the fire, stop the fire, Kix!
That is an order!

21:55.356 --> 21:57.018
Where is the?
Do we have eye contact?

21:57.441 --> 21:58.977
Negative, it's gone.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.778
Damn it, bishop!
I had it in sight.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.157
Subutai!

23:05.551 --> 23:09.465
- Subutai! Salt!
- Is dead!

23:24.820 --> 23:26.857
Commander!

23:27.156 --> 23:30.274
Commander, are you hurt?
Where is Subutai?

23:30.826 --> 23:32.613
Subutai! Subutai!

23:34.747 --> 23:36.283
!What the hell?!

23:36.999 --> 23:39.082
Do not! My truck!

23:39.335 --> 23:40.871
Damn Noids.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.371
Curse! Look at this shit.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.628
Ash scraped the engine and the whole system.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.631
For the repair we need a GMM.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.047
- A GMM?
"A great damn hammer, you idiot!"

23:56.810 --> 23:58.802
The equipment and the ammunition are ashes!

23:59.730 --> 24:01.892
We are 100 miles from the base.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.766
A long way home
without snow shoes.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.863
Without Ash we're not going anywhere.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.574
The first time I agree
with you, Bishop.

24:14.078 --> 24:18.288
At the edge of the death zone is a
probe with emergency equipment.

24:18.624 --> 24:21.913
If we get there,
we have a chance.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.874
Let's go hunting again.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.756
You do not have to worry
about hounding Ash.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.377
... he will hunt us!

24:42.147 --> 24:45.265
<i>The Humanoids were
created, ready to serve.</i>

24:46.276 --> 24:51.067
<i>They are stronger than we
are and manage the weather.</i>

24:51.991 --> 24:55.200
<i>They are hairless, His
blood is sour and black.</i>

24:55.953 --> 24:58.491
<i>They are like mules and
can not reproduce.</i>

24:59.373 --> 25:03.242
<i>A security measure against genetic
competition in the future.</i>

25:04.044 --> 25:05.325
<i>Its Creator said:</i>

25:05.326 --> 25:10.215
<i>His tranquility rests in
Absence of reproduction.</i>

25:11.051 --> 25:13.259
<i>But something is different now.</i>

25:14.138 --> 25:16.004
<i>The rebellion is spreading.</i>

25:17.016 --> 25:19.383
<i>They fight until his death,
something to protect.</i>

25:20.519 --> 25:22.714
<i>Something to preserve.</i>

25:53.385 --> 25:55.593
The blood is fresh, but not human.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.097
Let's find out, he's at the
end of the blood trail.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.906
It smells like something big died.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.995
Yes, Ash has returned
in his suit.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.451
Just smell it in your pussy with your breath, Kix.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.078
Listen to the talk.
Pay attention!.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.468
Okay, we split up

26:41.975 --> 26:43.887
Come here, little bird.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.813
Come here, come to Dad!
Stop the nonsense!

26:48.148 --> 26:50.435
I have goose bumps here!

26:50.651 --> 26:52.984
Who knows, what is
circulating around here.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.153
All right, I'm going in.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.027
I'll cover you.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.816
Let's go for it!

27:10.445 --> 27:12.067
You are dead, Kix

27:13.340 --> 27:15.127
Suck me the dick!

27:30.440 --> 27:32.306
What do you think this is, Commander?

27:33.110 --> 27:35.978
Noid art?

28:34.421 --> 28:37.129
Hey friend.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.232
Fuck you

29:02.407 --> 29:04.774
Fortunately, he is dead.
Let's take a blood sample.

29:07.120 --> 29:11.956
Shit! Hatta!

29:22.970 --> 29:24.711
Hatta!

29:24.930 --> 29:30.801
Shit, I can not aim!
I'm going out!

29:57.713 --> 29:59.796
Son of a bitch have to pay!

30:08.015 --> 30:09.927
Hey, asshole !!

30:12.519 --> 30:13.930
Come! Get it!

30:20.193 --> 30:22.560
You created the wrong gangster!

30:38.712 --> 30:42.831
I love the taste of black
blood in the morning!

30:47.804 --> 30:50.512
The thermal camera did not recognize its pattern.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.931
I thought he was dead.

30:53.560 --> 30:57.053
The turns of electronics.
We are approaching the death zone.

30:57.898 --> 30:58.979
You're good?

31:19.461 --> 31:21.077
Motherfucker!

31:24.132 --> 31:26.374
The electronics are fine, Commander.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.921
Well, Kix!

31:28.261 --> 31:30.423
What a sight you have so extreme.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.676
I've never seen a noid with hair.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.300
Because they do not grow hair, asshole.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.889
Mutated Humanoids.

31:39.523 --> 31:40.513
True.

31:40.732 --> 31:44.271
- This is a Sammy 69-7-H.
- A Sammy 69-7-H?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.519
This is an old model of pleasure, is not it?

31:46.822 --> 31:49.235
They probably lost their virginity, did not they, Hatta?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.703
- Are you cold?
- No sir.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.955
Pack it in the tank!

32:08.677 --> 32:10.168
Can you walk on that leg?

32:10.429 --> 32:11.636
Yes.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.421
You're going to make it, brother.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.893
<i>Ice teaches all humility.</i>

32:22.816 --> 32:24.478
<i>It shows us our limits.</i>

32:26.153 --> 32:27.769
<i>Our weaknesses.</i>

32:29.448 --> 32:31.030
<i>Our humanity.</i>

32:32.742 --> 32:36.361
<i>But in the area of death the ice is ruthless.</i>

32:52.721 --> 32:55.589
Looks like someone had your bright idea, Bishop.

32:56.183 --> 32:59.096
An accident rarely comes alone.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.278
Sauber!

33:56.785 --> 34:00.779
It seems that your drug addicts
friends are condemned here,

34:29.109 --> 34:32.693
What? Are we going to play now
"Cowboys and the damn Indians"?

34:33.280 --> 34:35.397
Only we are the damned Indians.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.737
Everyone knows the damn
Indians never win, my friend!

34:39.286 --> 34:41.197
Noids have no combat training.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.657
We do.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.790
Re-assemble and prepare.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.210
Check the Noid for DNA reconfiguration.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.828
I'll contact the base.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.208
I say: We hide in the next camp.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.294
The next camp is 100 miles from here.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.761
We're dead before we get there.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.894
Do not look so serious.

35:13.987 --> 35:15.853
I will not let you die.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.280
Very well, little one?

35:20.702 --> 35:22.568
Fuck you, Hatta!

35:26.833 --> 35:28.495
Accept the shit.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.839
We contacted the enemy right
outside the Death Zone.

35:36.426 --> 35:37.917
The truck is gone.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.214
Subutai has fallen.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.597
But we ended up mutated
humanoids in the process,

35:44.100 --> 35:46.888
<i>So it was a mutated humanoid Ash-393?</i>

35:47.354 --> 35:51.564
Negative, but it has been hormonally changed.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.766
We took a sample for an exam.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.861
<i>I do not care about mutated notions.</i>

35:57.113 --> 35:58.775
<i>I want Ash-393!</i>

35:58.990 --> 36:01.778
- I want him dead and disintegrated!
- Roger, General.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.118
We continue the search.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.952
We need an evacuation group.
Ishmael is almost frozen.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.581
You must leave here immediately.

36:11.509 --> 36:12.243
General?

36:13.046 --> 36:14.287
Can you hear me?

36:15.048 --> 36:16.414
Send an evacuation group.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.216
I repeat:
Send an evacuation group.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.979
Will we stay here all night, or what?

36:38.571 --> 36:40.858
An electromagnetic storm is coming.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.779
If we wait, we'll lose Ash.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.903
If we move now, we
still have a chance.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.326
I can do it, Commander!

36:53.044 --> 36:56.412
Kix, stay with Ishmael,
until the storm is over.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.505
I'm not a fucking nanny!

36:59.384 --> 37:02.343
"What were Trajan's orders?"
- Ash's going to die.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.503
Then I'll take care of that.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.716
I was born to hunt, Commander.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.854
The collection team arrives in the morning.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.109
All you have to do is
stay warm until then.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.949
Can you do that for me, Spartan?

37:29.831 --> 37:31.367
I can do it, Commander.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.998
Stay strong, brother.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.341
See you upstairs.

39:20.316 --> 39:24.811
What is it, Kix? Where's the fucking
bitch with thick balls now ?!

39:29.075 --> 39:31.943
I have your breath hanging right here, Hatta.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.012
In this forest... he pursues you!

40:11.451 --> 40:13.363
- Shit!
- What the hell...?

40:14.037 --> 40:15.448
Welcome to the area of death.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.076
The energies are useless here.

40:18.708 --> 40:19.915
Who says it?

40:20.335 --> 40:22.167
The magnetic field.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.837
Download charged particles.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.789
So Trajan was wrong?

40:27.550 --> 40:29.086
Shit!

40:29.636 --> 40:31.593
I do not give up!

40:33.306 --> 40:35.093
Hatta, let's flank it.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.220
You're hurt?

41:22.647 --> 41:26.140
Of course not... I can not say the
same thing about Trajan's partner.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.899
Bill Carson.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.353
You found old Bill, huh?

41:31.864 --> 41:33.400
He was a Spartan-5.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.323
And a friend.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.278
Establish a perimeter, we'll camp here.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.780
And give him a decent funeral.

41:47.255 --> 41:50.373
Ash has something special.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.799
I have something for him.

41:53.261 --> 41:56.174
We walked together, side by side.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.219
He waited to see me fall.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.050
I never fall

42:01.352 --> 42:04.595
I wanted to inoculate his black blood.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.150
I'll find you, Ash!

42:10.486 --> 42:13.729
Because you messed with
the wrong gangster!

42:49.025 --> 42:51.438
Why do you always read the same book, Kix?

42:53.863 --> 42:55.729
What makes it so special?

42:57.867 --> 43:01.031
"Men do not perish in the
results of lost wars,...

43:01.412 --> 43:03.904
... But the loss of
that resistance force

43:03.915 --> 43:05.156
Which contains only pure blood.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.371
Who are racially pure people
and conscious of their blood,

43:08.377 --> 43:09.367
He can never be a slave.

43:09.712 --> 43:13.797
In this world will always be bastard and bastard alone.

43:15.301 --> 43:19.841
Humanoid mutants are fully capable
of reproducing different types.

43:20.681 --> 43:23.674
That is the only thing
that the creator did well.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.888
Are you doing something deep, not Kix?

43:31.859 --> 43:34.021
"Does that book teach you all that?"
-Open mind.

43:34.237 --> 43:36.320
It helps me understand,
what I do.

43:37.115 --> 43:41.576
Every single mutant must be exterminated
for the human race to survive.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.536
Let's put it as data in the briefcase, Kix.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.406
Your psycho propaganda bothered me.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.950
Adolf Hitler was an unknown prophet.

43:50.294 --> 43:52.286
Your message is our salvation!

43:56.217 --> 43:58.300
You have real damage, Kix.

44:02.181 --> 44:06.596
"We will have to fight for the freedom
and the independence of the homeland

44:07.228 --> 44:11.188
Only in this way can the people fulfill the
task, which they received from the Creator. "

44:12.358 --> 44:14.270
There is no 'homeland' anymore.

44:14.861 --> 44:18.025
It's just what we left,
that's all that's left.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.523
The atmosphere was destroyed by us.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.566
No one else is to blame.

44:22.785 --> 44:25.744
And the asteroid, Bishop?
It was in the crater.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.995
I saw it with my own eyes.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.083
It looks more like an atomic bomb to me.

44:32.503 --> 44:36.213
It was an internal job...
That is always.

44:37.216 --> 44:39.674
Humanity is responsible for the eternal winter.

44:40.511 --> 44:43.219
Not God, or humanoids.

44:47.602 --> 44:51.095
It will no longer be a time hunted
by the shadows of your own guilt.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.607
It can eradicate parasites. "

44:58.863 --> 45:01.480
I'll be looking for you in the
destroyed fields, Bishop.

45:06.204 --> 45:10.619
Ok Kix, since you have so much energy tonight...

45:12.668 --> 45:14.409
... why do not you take the first guard?

45:18.132 --> 45:19.998
Have fun with your book.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.147
Mara!

45:54.460 --> 45:56.543
Come on, Bishop.

46:23.447 --> 46:26.531
Get up, Spartan.
There is something in the trees.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.728
I'll send you back to hell!

47:00.109 --> 47:01.691
Yellow-eyed devil!

48:21.399 --> 48:22.640
Bishop...

48:26.737 --> 48:28.694
I've marked it, Commander.

48:29.281 --> 48:31.739
I marked it clearly for you.

50:01.373 --> 50:04.366
Bishop, I'm here.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.971
Did you miss the fucking shot?
10 meters away?

50:26.649 --> 50:28.686
You are the total ruin, man.

50:28.943 --> 50:31.230
Did not Trajan take you out of the sewer?

50:31.445 --> 50:35.405
I would be a damned commander!
And my team would still be alive!

50:38.577 --> 50:42.821
Now it's your turn, Bishop.
Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot...

50:43.290 --> 50:45.031
... bye, son of a bitch!

51:03.978 --> 51:06.311
Listen, or you'll never
pull the trigger again.

51:06.939 --> 51:10.227
You do not have the eggs.
Reckless bitch!

51:41.599 --> 51:43.261
<i>Mara, they were wrong.</i>

51:44.518 --> 51:46.350
<i>There is life in the area of death.</i>

51:47.146 --> 51:48.353
<i>I will not resign.</i>

51:48.939 --> 51:51.397
<i>I will not stop, Before
we find our daughter.</i>

51:52.526 --> 51:54.142
<i>You are with me my love</i>

51:55.321 --> 51:56.812
<i>You're here with me now.</i>

53:37.005 --> 53:38.212
Ash!

56:28.260 --> 56:30.968
Come on, my friend.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.596
Calientetate.

56:36.393 --> 56:39.431
Hey, everything will be fine... do not die!

56:39.813 --> 56:42.305
Do you listen?
Calientetate.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.350
Returns!
Do not die!

56:49.197 --> 56:51.860
I want to see it again

56:52.826 --> 56:55.785
... last time.
I promise!

56:59.583 --> 57:02.451
I swear today until
the end of days,

57:03.045 --> 57:08.006
I will love you and honor
you, if you are with me.

57:08.884 --> 57:12.548
I will, now and forever.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.416
Stop, before you get hurt!

57:52.386 --> 57:54.048
I'm Atka.

57:55.055 --> 57:56.296
It's okay.

57:56.598 --> 57:58.134
I am here to help you.

58:05.273 --> 58:06.855
Let go!

58:08.902 --> 58:10.359
I helped you.

58:13.240 --> 58:18.827
Where are my clothes?

58:33.677 --> 58:34.963
How long I was passed out.

58:38.056 --> 58:39.422
Not enough.

59:07.002 --> 59:08.459
You're welcome!

59:10.630 --> 59:12.121
Bishop.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.176
Bishop?

59:29.816 --> 59:31.307
where we are?

59:33.361 --> 59:35.102
This is Quannik's house.

59:47.918 --> 59:50.285
- Quannik?
- He's been waiting for you.

59:52.839 --> 59:55.547
- As it did?
- He died.

59:59.679 --> 01:00:00.795
Forget this.

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.263
I have to get back on the road.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.223
How can I get out of here?

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.895
What are you looking for?

01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:12.022
- Death?
- That's funny.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:15.060
That's all the Death
Zone offers your people.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:16.898
I'm looking for a man.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.360
He is not a man!
His blood is as black as coal!

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:27.409
You know it.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.244
I saw how he buried you alive.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.493
For him you are dead now.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:36.339
It will not give you more trouble.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.716
I stole something.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.094
Something very special.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.471
What?

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.051
My daughter.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:56.354
Is the child yours?

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:00.772
- Little?
- Yeah.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.199
But I thought she was one of them.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.361
Can you take me with her?

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.743
Dangerous, she is protected.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:14.960
Please, Atka.

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:18.046
My life is nothing without it.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:46.909
Quannik thought, that the
time of red blood soon ends.

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:50.572
Soon comes the time of black blood.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:53.040
He lives for 143 years.

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:56.582
Many of his visions came true.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:59.872
He said there will be no
cure for black blood.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.460
Ash is nearby.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:06.970
I can feel his presence.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.093
Its smell is lifeless.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.354
Your path does not make sense.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.224
His traces only exist in the past.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.852
Like a ghost hunt.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.062
Ghosts have a soul.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.568
He does not.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.905
From a technical point of
view, A mind is a soul.

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:34.619
This is not funny, Bishop.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.958
I've seen them kill.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.336
Suicide would be the best option.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.623
If you're afraid,...

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:47.095
I get it. Just put me in the
right direction and I go alone.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:50.260
We must find Cage.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.222
That's not my style.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:57.145
Not like a hiding place.
Cage is a man!

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:59.522
An old and nasty fighter.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.017
With many weapons.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.071
He lives four days walking,
Inside the death zone.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.157
No human is so crazy.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.527
I did not say,
that is not crazy.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.322
Come. I know the way

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.529
Hello, guests.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.071
My name is Sara.
Sorry, my husband is not there.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.569
Will come back later

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:03.663
We wait.

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:36.074
Cookies, that's milk.

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.197
I can see that, Sara.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:49.124
Where do you get them?

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:51.589
I made them, of course.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.672
They try my husband better
than his mother's cookies.

01:04:56.935 --> 01:04:59.177
Did you make the milk?

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.839
What the hell is going on here?

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.460
You're a humanoid!
Why do you have hair?

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:37.052
My husband told me that I am the first
blonde but unfortunately I am brunette, so

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:42.261
Where are you from, Sara?

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.977
- I was born in this cabin.
- No, that's impossible!

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.518
Tell me the truth.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.654
- Where are you from?
- You're far from home, Spartan!

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:54.736
"Do you want to tell me what you do in my cabin?"
- He's a friend, Cage.

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.075
There is no reason for the weapon.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:06:00.951
With her, I'll blow your face away!

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:05.910
I'm looking for a girl.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.500
She was kidnapped by a Humanoid.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.833
My partner said that
maybe you could help me.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.172
This is no help for the Spartans.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:17.680
I do not like to waste
time with Federation slag.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.015
Spartan, my ass!

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:22.768
As I said...

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:27.603
I would appreciate any information
you or Sara may have about the girl.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:30.024
You must be five now.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.399
If you can not help,
let's go our way again.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.743
And we do not ask questions.

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:41.757
A gun does not want to help you, son.

01:06:41.758 --> 01:06:43.586
What if I do not want to help you?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:44.994
What happens then?

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.169
Question answered?

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.378
Rat, piece of Spartan garbage!

01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:59.259
You and your Indian slut
can kiss me in the ass!

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.067
You play my wife, you bastard,
I'll kill you and all of you...

01:07:07.068 --> 01:07:09.608
Do you have permission to have this Noid mutated?

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.520
Delicious breast milk for your cookies!

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:14.646
It's no noid, it's Sara.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:18.441
Do not waste it, I'm too
old for the way I like it.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.740
- I know where the rebel Noids are.
- Where are they!

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.447
I traded with them, thinking
I would trade enough.

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:28.159
Trade with fugitive humanoids?
Maybe you get only 30 years.

01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:32.584
And old Sara, she should be more than happy
to return to the local palaces of pleasure.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.628
"And give milk... for cookies!"
- It's okay!

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.213
I'll help you!

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.462
We have to wait for them at the meeting place.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:42.632
They always arrive at eight.
There are only a few kilometers.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:48.058
Okay, biscuit.
Daddy's here now.

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:50.313
Is Dad.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.025
I will protect you.

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:04.615
Have you no manners, son of a bitch?

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:09.499
- Do you have any more weapons?
- Pissing ice balls on the icebergs?

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:16.252
This is all my team,
long before your time.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:27.676
Sergeant Ulysses H.
Cage, Spartan-3.

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:31.180
Retired after 30 years of service in the field.

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.474
Be my butt.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.520
The Spartans do not retreat.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.273
They die like a hero.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:43.738
Or they pee like cowards.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:51.076
Put this piece of gun away and I'll
show you exactly how cowardly I am.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.721
Why did you run away then?

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:08.140
In time for the promotion.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:12.850
There were only two of us:

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:17.276
I, with 30 years of experience in the field.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:22.113
And this kid from the academy.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:25.609
It was full of extensions.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:28.912
Artificially intelligent implants and so on.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.957
There could only be one of us.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.158
We treat it the same way.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:35.669
Or your way.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:39.252
I guess the manager was
probably good, so...

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:44.636
Trajan son of a bitch... Trajan
became the new commander.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:49.890
And I... I was thrown out of this garbage.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:52.769
Trajan?

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.351
General Trajan?

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:59.109
General? Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, that suits you.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:03.151
I always knew that son of a
bitch would come up easily.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:08.031
At that moment he was so deep
in the ass of his superiors,

01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.153
I could smell, what they had for breakfast.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.338
Duty calls!

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:08.379
That's where I meet the
Noids right there.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.965
Make sure you go straight.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:15.845
The 306 cartridges you have.
I do not want to have lead poisoning,

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.847
Before it's all over here.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.388
Too small for a humanoid.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:54.925
Who you are?

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:13.699
- Shit! Kix!
- Who?

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.907
Why is this man threatening
my husband with a gun?

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.584
- Do not allow...
- Shut her up.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.970
-Get down, you Nazi bitch.
-No no!

01:12:41.993 --> 01:12:46.441
Cookie, Cookie, Cookie!

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:50.485
No no no no!

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:56.032
Cookie!
Do not!

01:12:56.289 --> 01:13:00.829
Do not! Please do not leave me!

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.936
It's a bad plan anyway.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:05.564
The best strategy is, to
destroy the enemy from within.

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:09.359
He must defeat himself.

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:11.357
Do not be an enemy, Bishop!

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:18.615
The personification of the
devil is a symbol of all evil.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:22.369
In the form of humanoids.

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.584
That's you, black blood!

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.838
Let me go, black blood!

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.220
I'm going to kill them all!

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:41.054
Just wait, I'll kill you!

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:56.690
Keep your breath and
keep the peace with God.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:03.076
Shit!
What do the Noids know about God?

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.579
You are raised as rats in the laboratory.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.672
Is the color of our blood so different?

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:16.506
Are not we all children of God?

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.014
God did not create you.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:26.562
-We did. You are an abomination without a soul.
- I am sorry!

01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:29.438
I can not hear you!

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.108
Does your heart hurt?

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.777
Let me have a look.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:10.643
The old warriors believed,
that the heart was sacred.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:19.440
That if a hunter tasted his flesh,

01:16:20.868 --> 01:16:23.076
I could look at the spiritual world.

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:39.668
But I do not see any spiritual world.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:48.261
Maybe she was the only
one, who had no soul.

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:54.895
Food for the creatures of God.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.604
You disappoint me, Bishop.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:03.613
I expected much more
from Mara's husband.

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.745
You are more trash than the man.

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:12.455
Barbarous and cruel.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.633
<i>A daughter.</i>

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:30.226
<i>Our daughter, Mara.</i>

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:39.394
<i>Come on, Bishop. Follow me.</i>

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:58.755
How can you leave us alone ?!

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:33.202
Are you my daughter?

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.288
My name is Aluxia.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.832
I have been waiting for you.

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:50.135
- I'm dead?
- Do you feel dead?

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.228
Not quite.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.482
Just tired.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.193
You've been dreaming.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.569
Yes.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.034
And you were there.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.075
I do not want to get lost.

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:16.458
- Leave it alone, Aluxia.
- Ok dad.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.087
Why am I still alive?

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.923
I made a promise to your wife.

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:35.264
"You killed her."
- Do not.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:38.771
That's what they want to make you believe.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.521
Because you did?

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.106
Why did you take it from me?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.905
Mara was my creator.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:51.576
She got me up, knew
I was different.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.653
She was my mother.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.994
You do not have mothers!

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.880
The quarantine of the
Federation did it for the test.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.293
So that we begin to
show genetic anomalies.

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.430
Anomalies that the superior
command did not like.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:14.636
Like what.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:17.974
- Hair?
- Some of us.

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:23.065
For others, like me, or more...

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.606
...Advanced.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.941
We have developed the
ability, to reproduce.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:35.946
Your wife kept the secret for a long time.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.451
When she threatened, with
scattering the secret.

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:44.878
The top command entered.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.717
They wanted to keep it a secret.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.048
At all costs

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.167
Stop!
They have no right...

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.397
Your investigation is over.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.025
Dirty Noid-Bitch!

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.219
No, you murdered her!

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:17.596
I saw it with my own eyes!

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:19.299
I did not kill her!

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.013
I tried to save her.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.307
She died in my arms.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:27.181
She begged me to take
the baby, but...

01:22:29.736 --> 01:22:31.398
... it was very late.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.907
Liar!

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.781
I understand, why do not you believe me.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.452
It's hard to accept, that
your world is breaking.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.037
When you are in it,
pick up the pieces.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:49.629
But maybe...
You believe her.

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:15.442
Come Aluxia, let's play somewhere else.

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:34.333
Bishop, I'm sorry, my love.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.132
I wanted to tell you.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:41.176
I feared for your life.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.092
I knew the truth too late.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.730
I was wrong.

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:52.225
We were all wrong.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:59.108
We have created them, but
we do not control it.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.652
We are not their gods.

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:05.493
Your destiny is yours.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:09.997
Like us, they can love...

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.291
They can create offspring.

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:17.300
They have souls, who long for freedom.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:23.431
The humanoids must release them.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:46.654
Remember when we said, that
we were going to this place?

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:48.368
Yes.

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:52.702
Across the country, up here.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:56.585
Can you remember, what's
the name of this place?

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:02.939
-Selegna Sol.
"All right, Selegna Sol.

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:06.091
We can leave this cave cold.

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:08.851
The Selegna Sol.
There it is wonderfully hot.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:11.186
- Are you waiting for it?
- Yeah.

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:13.017
I also.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.519
Why did you come back?

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:20.780
And you risked all this?

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.362
I was once a slave.

01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:27.745
I dreamed of it, like a
free man walking on ice.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:32.538
No matter how many men tried to
pull that dream out of my mind.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.040
I hid it deep in my heart.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:42.256
And now as a free man
I walk on the ice.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.928
I found myself chained to
this beautiful flower.

01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:51.477
And she deserved more,
like my simple dream.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:55.265
This is not a place where the
soul of a child can flourish.

01:25:57.361 --> 01:26:00.069
Your wife spoke of a
magnificent place in the west.

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.480
Where the ice must melt.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.111
And the seasons have agreed for decades.

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.155
It is a myth.

01:26:07.788 --> 01:26:10.531
Anyone who has gone to look
for him never came back.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:15.244
Would you have returned from this place if
you had discovered something beautiful?

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:20.248
Only a small flower changes the course of humanity

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:22.424
And the opinions of a man.

01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.302
Your wife promised to show
me the way to this place.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:33.185
The next day she was dead.

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:40.317
The promise of Selegna Sol died with her

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:42.778
Do not.

01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:45.694
She hid the coordinates
deep into my DNA.

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:51.913
Somehow, my intuition
pushed me to find out.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.181
Selegna Sol.

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:19.649
It's a pretty long night, on
the other side of the world

01:27:20.277 --> 01:27:22.769
It will be the journey of life.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:31.827
Trajan will send the
Spartans to hunt you down.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.071
Not if he thinks I'm dead.

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:48.420
This is one of the original
prototypes of the Ash-300 series.

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:50.963
Killed during the rebellion.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:58.013
On my own, I have added DNA synthesis
through epigenetic reprogramming.

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:01.015
Embryonic stem cells once...

01:28:01.016 --> 01:28:06.075
... paired with their DNA
became identical to mine.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:09.486
You made a barbecue clone of yourself.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.746
- I'm going to travel with you, to deliver the body.
- Do not.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.417
You are a free man.

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.625
- But promise me one thing.
- Tell me.

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.923
Aluxia must do this for Selegna Sol.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.592
Fact!

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:16.883
<i>Now it's just you and me, Mara.</i>

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:20.765
<i>Just you and me.</i>

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.603
<i>Alone on the ice.</i>

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:28.691
<i>You were right about them.
You were always right.</i>

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:32.523
<i>It's a murder.</i>

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:35.652
<i>It always was.</i>

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:38.491
<i>And I owe this crime.</i>

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:46.458
<i>I give up...</i>

01:29:47.591 --> 01:29:49.173
<i>... I give up everything.</i>

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:55.130
<i>Even that cascade of memory,
which I chose to drown.</i>

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.098
Mara!

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:10.278
<i>This final act...
This delivery.</i>

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:16.484
<i>I renounce everything,
that I have hoped to be</i>

01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:10.246
Commander Bishop.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:13.249
It's good to see him alive.

01:31:14.094 --> 01:31:15.426
Trajan!

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:19.721
Mission "Winter Dream"
Accomplished

01:31:20.058 --> 01:31:22.050
Ash's body is in the sack.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:25.387
- Send an extraction team.
"Well done, Spartan.

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:31.521
You will be a hero in the world!

01:31:31.945 --> 01:31:33.186
I'm not interested.

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:36.572
Did you find out, where do
the other bastards hide?

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:43.947
Oh, come on, Bishop! We know they are
breeding like rabbits for decades.

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:49.369
Why do you put your hologram
and find it yourself, Trajan?

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:52.280
Come on Bishop, if you do not want to cooperate...

01:31:52.281 --> 01:31:55.624
... we can always extract your
information from your neuro-implant.

01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:58.173
If required.

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:00.387
Is that what you told my wife?

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:02.347
Before he murdered her?

01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:04.604
It was never personal, Bishop!

01:32:04.605 --> 01:32:07.102
But humanoid reproduction
is a capital offense.

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:10.690
The scientific ambition of your
wife was the death sentence.

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:14.814
This is why the human race takes
precedence for its petty grievances.

01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:17.863
I've died 1,000 times to catch you, Trajan.

01:32:18.742 --> 01:32:21.735
And I will die a thousand times
more, to see your head on a stake!

01:32:23.413 --> 01:32:27.282
I trained you well, Bushio...
too well!

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:32.586
I guess you're already dead.

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:35.043
That would have saved me a lot of trouble.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:40.010
That would have cleared this difficult situation.

01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:42.470
Sorry to disappoint you, General.

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:46.345
Check the body.

01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:59.981
He is our man, General.
Ash-393 is dead, Mr.

01:33:00.283 --> 01:33:01.239
Excellent.

01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:03.943
The Federation has become a little more secure.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:07.579
Give us the coordinates of the humanoid settlement!

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:09.999
Or get ready for a lobotomy!

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:16.421
I do not think so, Trajan.

01:33:18.176 --> 01:33:21.635
Let's see if your implants
survive a grenade explosion.

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:24.422
Come now, Commander you have
known, how this will end.

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:26.056
Like his wife!

01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:28.304
You have to choose a page.

01:33:28.603 --> 01:33:32.062
With those ice cream?
There are better machines!

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:34.606
Without us, they have no future.

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:37.109
They were built for and by us!

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:39.445
They are not our children,
they are slaves.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:43.278
Our survival depends on extermination!

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.901
Open your eyes, Bishop!

01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:48.196
We are surrounded by ice,
this planet is dead!

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:52.120
There are not enough resources
to pick them up these days.

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:57.921
Would you choose those
of your own kind?

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.757
If this is what we will become...

01:34:05.682 --> 01:34:07.014
... then yes!

01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:08.973
I choose them.

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:12.144
Your new rank is JMATR!

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:14.309
FUCK MORE THAN ALL RECOGNITION!
After your Spartan body.

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:22.105
Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot!

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:25.274
Also know as...

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:29.658
Goodbye, motherfuckers.

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:20.374
Kill him!

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:27.337
What the...? Something is wrong
with the weapons Malfunction!

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:29.050
Malfunction of the weapon, sir!

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:32.887
Welcome to the area of death, idiots!

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:49.483
Come on! Kill these weak heads!

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:54.955
What happens to you?
Come on!

01:35:56.334 --> 01:36:00.203
This is not over yet!
You come to my death list!

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:05.045
I will hunt you personally!
This is a high treason to the Federation!

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:08.298
Go to hell!

01:36:16.562 --> 01:36:18.053
That gave me luck.

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:21.774
It was almost a palette,
until I met my new friends.

01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:24.768
It's good to see you alive, brother.

01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:47.000
<i>Who put us in charge of the world?</i>

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.970
<i>How did our lie
become our truth?</i>

01:36:55.351 --> 01:36:56.842
<i>Nobody cares to remember.</i>

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:06.564
<i>The cold heart of nature now
forms honest men on the ice.</i>

01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:10.614
<i>And under the area of
death, life comes.</i>

01:37:12.744 --> 01:37:15.487
<i>After 300 years of slavery,</i>

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:19.077
<i>The humanoids are walking
towards their freedom.</i>

01:37:20.543 --> 01:37:22.000
<i>We did it, Mara!</i>

01:37:22.754 --> 01:37:24.290
<i>Thank you my love.</i>

01:37:24.589 --> 01:37:26.831
<i>I'll see you upstairs.</i>

01:37:36.826 --> 01:37:38.933
<i>In a world invaded by cowards.</i>

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.934
<i>The only thing left for
a man is to fight.</i>

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:46.396
<i>Fight, until hell freezes.</i>

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:49.690
<i>Then fight them on the ice.</i>

01:37:51.013 --> 01:37:53.418
