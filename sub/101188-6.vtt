WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:04.296
So Dan's sex doll's
been living with me. Um...

00:04.379 --> 00:06.465
After he threw her away last
week, I-I went and I got her

00:06.548 --> 00:09.051
and I took her home,
so she's living with me.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.678
And, um, she talks to me.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.305
- You hear the voice in your head

00:13.388 --> 00:15.390
when you're looking at the doll
or is the doll...?

00:15.474 --> 00:17.976
- The sound comes from her, um, head.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.394
From her face. You know.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.396
Like, she can move her face.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.648
Like, she... opens her mouth and stuff

00:22.731 --> 00:23.941
and she can, like, move her eyes

00:24.024 --> 00:26.193
and make expressions and stuff.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.694
But she can't move her, uh, head.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.030
Like the-the head part
of her head. You know.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.281
- The skull?
- The skull.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.824
The-- Well,
the cranium or whatever.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.409
It's, like, kind of frustrating,

00:34.493 --> 00:35.953
'cause I have to do everything for her.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.121
- What kind of stuff
do you have to do for her?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.957
- Um, she made me buy her
one of those T-shirts

00:40.040 --> 00:41.625
that says "The Future is Female."

00:41.708 --> 00:43.794
And she wants a new vagina.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.005
She wants, like,
a Cherry Blossom 7 series?

00:47.089 --> 00:48.423
You know these...

00:48.507 --> 00:50.133
Well, they're expensive,

00:50.217 --> 00:52.302
and I told her I couldn't
afford it, and she was like,

00:52.386 --> 00:53.512
"Well, you're a fucking dick."

00:53.595 --> 00:54.888
So...

00:54.972 --> 00:58.141
- You know, we see this
a lot in children.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.768
The invention of an imaginary friend?

00:59.852 --> 01:01.812
It's a very common coping mechanism.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.314
- Right. Like Drop Dead Fred.
- I haven't seen that one.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.149
- Well, eh, it's just okay.
I mean...

01:06.233 --> 01:07.776
I kind of kept hoping
that they would hook up.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.279
- Anyway, imaginary friends usually pop up

01:10.362 --> 01:13.156
during a time of transition,
a time of growth.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.409
- Oh, no. They kissed, I think.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.202
I can't remember.
- It's less common in adults,

01:17.286 --> 01:19.538
sure, but I think this...

01:19.621 --> 01:21.665
Does she have a name?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.375
- Barbara.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.378
- I think this Barbara

01:26.461 --> 01:31.592
represents a part of you that
really wants to help heal you.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.468
- Really?
- Yes.

01:33.552 --> 01:36.471
So, as long as she's not suggesting

01:36.555 --> 01:38.932
you cause physical harm
to yourself or others,

01:39.016 --> 01:42.352
I say embrace her.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.438
- I've been doing some thinking.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.857
We should kill Dan.
- What?

01:49.943 --> 01:50.903
We're not, we're not talking about this.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.154
We're not doing that.
- Cody.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.114
Dan stole the best years of my life,

01:54.198 --> 01:57.701
and he literally threw me out
like I was fucking garbage.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.162
He ravaged my vagina like all men do.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.372
- Okay, we're not killing Dan.
- Why?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.708
- And I'm sorry that he, like,
ravaged your pussy...

02:04.791 --> 02:07.628
- Thank you.
- ...but here's the thing, babe.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.254
You can't say stuff like that.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.547
- Why not?
- 'Cause my therapist told me

02:10.631 --> 02:12.299
that if you did, I had to get rid of you.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
- Well, you can tell your
therapist to go fucking shove

02:14.468 --> 02:16.470
up a-- I love her.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.556
Because I was joking.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.308
- I know you're just saying that
so that I won't get rid of you.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.893
You're me. I know.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.103
And, like... this week
has been fun or whatever,

02:25.187 --> 02:28.065
but, like, I mean, you're really
mean to me all the time,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.817
and we haven't actually done any
work on the tooth fairy pilot.

02:30.901 --> 02:32.694
- Cody, I have to be
totally honest with you.

02:32.778 --> 02:37.032
Like... your pilot's a piece of shit.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.825
- What are you--
what are you talking about?

02:38.909 --> 02:40.786
In the dumpster the other night,
you were, like, excited.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.204
You were pitching me all this stuff.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.413
- We put lipstick on a pig.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.831
Like, it's really bad, honey.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.167
If it was on TV, I'd literally
rather kill myself.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.794
- Okay, well, I have to write a pilot.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.170
I have to write something.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.630
My agent told me that it...

02:51.713 --> 02:53.882
doesn't have to be anything.
- Us.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.134
- What-- Us what?
- The pilot's us.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.470
A quirky, fun-loving sex doll
and her chunky human friend

02:58.554 --> 02:59.888
taking on the world together.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.849
I mean, it's, like, aspirational.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.767
- Okay, I just want to go back,
'cause when you say chunky,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.477
you say it as though, like, it's obvious.

03:05.561 --> 03:06.770
- Dude. It's, like, female empowerment.

03:06.854 --> 03:07.938
I mean, it's literally got everything.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.565
It could be, like, a feminist masterpiece

03:09.648 --> 03:13.110
or some shit.
- Like, but how's it feminist?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.736
- What do you mean? All of it.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.321
Just, it's there. You know?

03:16.405 --> 03:18.365
- I don't know, it's kind of
like a broad concept

03:18.448 --> 03:19.741
to, like, try and say
something super important.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.201
- Oh, my God, you are being so stupid.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.620
Trust me, it's such a good idea, I swear.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.581
- Okay. Oh, shit, I got to go.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.790
- What?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.000
Is it Dan?
- No.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.585
- Ugh, you're leaving me for Dan's?

03:29.668 --> 03:31.044
Why? We just started riffing.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.088
Cody. Cody, if you leave right now,

03:33.172 --> 03:34.798
I am not helping you with your pilot.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.676
And it's basically already
written in my head. Ha, ha, ha!

03:37.759 --> 03:40.888
I'm laughing at a joke on
page nine right now!

03:45.976 --> 03:48.353
- He just told me, "Stay away.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.814
I've smelled this smell before."

03:50.898 --> 03:52.608
I said, "What are you talking about?"

03:52.691 --> 03:57.196
And he goes, "It smells
like somebody's dead."

03:57.279 --> 03:59.364
- What's up?
- Oh, uh, nothing,

03:59.448 --> 04:00.908
I thought I-- never mind.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.284
- Hmm?
- Are you okay?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.702
I'm great.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.121
Just collecting alloys.
- Yeah.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.206
- You okay?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.208
- Yeah. I'm okay.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.001
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.091
Um...

04:18.175 --> 04:21.553
Okay, so...

04:23.597 --> 04:25.140
Wh...

04:25.224 --> 04:27.434
What if...

04:27.518 --> 04:31.104
after you threw out

04:31.188 --> 04:35.108
the sex doll, um...

04:35.192 --> 04:37.945
what if I went into the garbage
and I took her out

04:38.028 --> 04:40.906
and I took her home with me

04:40.989 --> 04:46.119
and we became roommates and...

04:46.203 --> 04:49.456
she was, like, talking to me?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.211
- That's fucking brilliant!

04:56.421 --> 04:57.548
- Um...

04:57.631 --> 05:00.759
- That's your new pilot?

05:00.843 --> 05:02.761
Oh, my God, and you were scared

05:02.845 --> 05:04.388
I'd be mad because it's about us?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.598
- I guess I was, yeah.

05:06.682 --> 05:10.561
- Baby, this is so much fucking better
than that tooth fairy thing.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.314
This is insane.
It's, like, a modern feminist Mister Ed.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.526
- Totally. Yeah.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.990
Barbara, I missed you while I was gone

05:23.073 --> 05:26.535
and I was thinking about
that idea that we...

05:28.328 --> 05:30.080
No, I haven't talked to Dan about it.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.499
Like, why would I
even bring it up to him?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.209
It's...

05:34.293 --> 05:36.753
Are we, like, in a fight?
Come on. Like, we're adults.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.672
We're not gonna...

05:40.716 --> 05:43.302
Barbara, that outfit is dope!

05:43.385 --> 05:44.511
Fuck.

06:00.611 --> 06:06.366
Barbara... you're right.

06:06.450 --> 06:10.204
I didn't trust you
because I didn't trust myself.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.003
But now that you're in my life...

06:22.758 --> 06:26.512
...something's been changing inside me.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.894
I've been thinking about what it means
to be a woman in this world,

06:33.977 --> 06:36.396
and I don't want to do it
like that anymore.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.362
The time has come for us
to lift each other up.

06:43.445 --> 06:46.031
And heal each other.

06:50.619 --> 06:54.248
It's time for a new beginning.
