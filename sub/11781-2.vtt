WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.510
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.049
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.584
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.617 --> 00:19.553
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.156
JANE: Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:22.190 --> 00:23.457
Ben, the job search, it's...

00:23.491 --> 00:25.326
Your big brother
has it handled.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.063
RITA: I don't know, Jane.
You'd have to sign up for
the career internship program.

00:29.097 --> 00:32.233
You'd be sacrificing
a huge part of your
high school experience.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.467
it's not like
I'm at the center

00:33.501 --> 00:35.503
of the social universe
around here as it is.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.472
BILLY: What is this?
Sneaking around for
the past three months.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.575
I don't get it.
You've forbidden me
from telling a soul.

00:41.609 --> 00:42.543
I like you, Billy.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.212
I have to do something.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.579
They're going to
take our house.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.515
Gray will be with you
in a minute.
And good luck.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.484
I average an assistant
or two a month.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.620
You make it a week,
I'll be shocked.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.522
BIRDIE: And that is
India Jourdain,

00:54.555 --> 00:56.524
Associate Designer.
Directly beneath Gray.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.826
That weasel is
after my job.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.429
And I am not going out
without a fight.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.232
Starting salary is 34,000.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.299
I'll take it.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.272
JANE: Famed fashion icon
Yves Saint Laurent once said

01:11.305 --> 01:13.541
that elegance
is forgetting what
one is wearing.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.612
Considering the week
I'm about to have,

01:18.646 --> 01:20.548
I sure hope
(ALARM BEEPING)

01:22.916 --> 01:25.519
* I must be dreaming

01:25.553 --> 01:29.657
* Like I've been here
some time before

01:29.690 --> 01:32.593
* I've seen these faces
in familiar places

01:32.626 --> 01:35.529
* And it's just
too much to ignore

01:35.563 --> 01:38.599
* It's a broken record playing

01:38.632 --> 01:43.137
* I get caught up
in the same two lines

01:43.171 --> 01:46.340
* Put the song
back to the start

01:46.374 --> 01:49.677
* And open my eyes

01:49.710 --> 01:52.680
* I woke up in yesterday

01:52.713 --> 01:56.617
* At the very same time
in the very same way... *

01:56.650 --> 01:58.652
I was gonna eat that.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.189
I need you to drive.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.557
It's not even 8:00
and I already have
six e-mails from Gray.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.359
Not to mention
a lost earring shipment

02:05.393 --> 02:06.694
from a country
that I can't pronounce.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.529
SeWhat?ly?

02:08.562 --> 02:11.299
You're really gonna
keep up this whole
double life thing?

02:11.332 --> 02:13.234
Oh, I don't know, Billy.

02:13.267 --> 02:14.635
I mean,
do I continue to work at
my fashion dream job,

02:14.668 --> 02:17.171
or do I return to a life
of high school obscurity?

02:17.205 --> 02:18.472
What should I do?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.609
Come on, Jane.
Obscurity?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.346
Little dramatic,
don't you think?

02:25.379 --> 02:26.447
(SCOFFS)

02:26.480 --> 02:27.848
We're just misunderstood.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.718
Besides, aren't you
a little burnt out on
that whole work thing?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.553
Are you kidding?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.522
I love this.
This job?

02:34.555 --> 02:37.291
It's the first thing
I think about when I
wake up in the morning

02:37.325 --> 02:38.959
and the last thing
I think about every night.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.728
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.596
Sometimes.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.698
When Ms. Dean
wears that scholastically
inappropriate sweater

02:44.732 --> 02:46.934
on Fridays,
for instance.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.403
I mean, I guess
that feeling might be
a little different, though.

02:49.437 --> 02:52.206
Yeah. Charming.
We're still not driving.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.708
And for the record,
that sweater is
age inappropriate.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.511
That woman
should be teaching
Ill-fitting Attire 101.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.712
I'd take that class.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.281
I'm sure you would.

03:06.654 --> 03:10.558
* I've my heart where
my head should be

03:10.591 --> 03:13.727
* Light up the rest of me

03:13.761 --> 03:17.465
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

03:17.498 --> 03:19.333
* Through the stops,
the starts

03:19.367 --> 03:22.403
* And life is a work of art

03:24.772 --> 03:28.276
* It seemed like
the week would never end

03:31.312 --> 03:33.481
* She knows that
he will be there

03:33.514 --> 03:37.318
* Yeah, she knows that
he'll be there *

03:37.351 --> 03:39.287
What do you say, Janey?
This Saturday?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.355
A night out
in the city?

03:41.389 --> 03:44.525
Come on.
It'll be magical.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.528
Well, I definitely
would like to see you
in a tux. So...

03:47.561 --> 03:48.829
I'm in.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.839

04:05.479 --> 04:06.680

04:06.714 --> 04:09.817
* Eyes
Eyes on the prize

04:09.850 --> 04:12.820
You found it?
Thank you so, so much!

04:12.853 --> 04:15.356
You totally saved my...

04:15.389 --> 04:17.825
No, of course.
I'll be there soon. I'm...

04:17.858 --> 04:19.427
I'm on my way!

04:21.795 --> 04:22.830
Hey, Jane.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.732
Oh! Hi.

04:24.765 --> 04:29.370
* I swear I don't
know anything

04:29.403 --> 04:31.739
* Oh whoa, oh whoa
oh whoa, oh whoa

04:31.772 --> 04:34.742
* We keep on going
'cause we can't say no

04:34.775 --> 04:36.844
* Oh whoa, oh whoa
oh whoa, oh whoa

04:36.877 --> 04:40.481
* Oh, wow, wow, wow
Oh, my, my, my, oh!

* Oh whoa, oh whoa
oh whoa, oh whoa

04:43.484 --> 04:46.320
* We keep on going
till we lose our souls

04:46.354 --> 04:48.456
* Oh whoa, oh whoa
oh whoa, oh whoa

04:48.489 --> 04:50.891
* Oh, wow, wow, wow, oh!

Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

oh whoa, oh whoa

* Oh, wow, wow, wow
Oh, my, my, my, oh! *

05:03.571 --> 05:05.606
We have a situation, Janet.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.909
Turns out no one liked
your little presentation
last week after all.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.879
Turns out they loved it.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.914
Congratulations.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.617
You're kidding me!

05:16.650 --> 05:17.751
I don't kid.

05:17.785 --> 05:18.886
She doesn't kid.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.889
No, I know.
Thank you, Gray.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.757
But really,
it was all you.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.559
Of course it was me.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.694
Of course.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.662
Problem is,
they loved it so much

05:28.696 --> 05:30.898
they've decided to launch it
at the fashion preview.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.533
The what?

05:32.566 --> 05:34.435
Preview party.
This Saturday.
Behind you.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.470
It's where we show
our upcoming line

05:36.504 --> 05:39.139
to potential investors
and publishers.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.641
This is great!

05:40.674 --> 05:41.875
No. It's terrible.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.911
Te Right. .

05:43.944 --> 05:46.780
I can't get back in time
to get that line ready
for that preview party.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.482
She cannot get back.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.384
And if that line is
not beyond perfection...

05:50.418 --> 05:51.452
Perfection.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.153
Well, with India
after my job,

05:53.186 --> 05:54.788
I certainly
can't expect her
to handle things.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.123
Definitively not.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.526
If only there
were someone...

05:58.559 --> 06:00.728
Someone that
I could depend on.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.763
Someone like...

06:02.796 --> 06:04.532
BOTH: You.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.534
Is that a problem?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.402
No. It's just...

06:08.436 --> 06:11.939
You know,
I sort of have plans
this Saturday night and...

06:11.972 --> 06:13.807
No, no, no.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.410
Um, I'll cancel.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.512
Are you sure
you can do it?

06:18.546 --> 06:21.682
Yes. I'm sure.
I can do it.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.484
Do you think she can
do it, Stefano?

06:23.517 --> 06:24.818
I do.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.487
Excellent.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.891
(SIGHS) I think.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.834
I am so in over my head.
I've never even been

06:40.868 --> 06:42.736
to a fashion preview,
let alone prepped
a line for one.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.937
You'll be fine, Jane.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.506
Look, it's
a huge opportunity.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.807
But one you can
totally handle.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.709
One that many of us
would've jumped at
the chance to have.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.877
Look, you can't
pass this up.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.445
And you're
gonna do great.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.447
(SIGHS)
You Absolutely!k so?

06:53.481 --> 06:55.983
Okay. I can do this.
I can do this, right?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.585
You can't
not do it.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.752
Of course
you can.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.821
Thanks, guys.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.657
Bye-bye, Jane.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.462
Are you even
listening to me?

07:08.496 --> 07:11.665
Pay close attention.
Or I will kill you
in your sleep.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.535
I said
obsidian beads!

07:16.036 --> 07:17.571
(EXHALES)

07:21.642 --> 07:23.911
(WHISPERS)
SShe's hideous!

07:29.049 --> 07:30.518
I've been looking
for you all day.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.721
That's nice.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.657
I had a good time
the other night with you,
getting to know you, Jane.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.495
I was thinking
you and I should go on
a proper date though, yeah?

07:41.529 --> 07:43.463
Mmm, I don't think so.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.502
Are you all right?

07:48.536 --> 07:51.505
I'm great.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.674
I just...
I gotta go.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.750
Whoa, whoa,
back up a sec.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.518
You actually
like this guy?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.787
No.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.022
Yeah.
A little, I guess.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.624
I don't know.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.759
But that was
before I saw him

08:11.792 --> 08:13.994
all up in India Jourdain's
business the other night.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.797
Just how up
in her business was he?

08:16.830 --> 08:19.533
Billy, please.
Don't perv out on me.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.934
This is about my job.

08:20.968 --> 08:24.672
Yeah. The job that's
leaving me flying solo
at the dance Saturday.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.674
(SIGHS)
I know. I'm sorry.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.909
I'll call you back.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.648
I'm golf. Not tennis.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.917
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, I know, I just...

08:36.950 --> 08:38.251
I want to talk
to you about something.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.722
Sorry. No, I can't
help you there, man.
I'm not into that stuff.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.691
No. Not...

08:44.091 --> 08:45.993
What?

08:46.026 --> 08:49.096
That was my brother, Tommy.
He got fired last summer.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.698
I don't want
any trouble, okay?

08:50.731 --> 08:51.732
That's not what I want
to talk to you about.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.567
I was wondering
about Jane.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.802
You guys are
close, right?

08:55.603 --> 08:56.870
Yeah? So?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.674
So, I, uh...

09:00.708 --> 09:03.611
(CHUCKLES) Look, man,
you're not making
this easy. I was just...

09:04.011 --> 09:05.646
Are you guys...

09:06.747 --> 09:08.115
You know.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.918
She's my best friend.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.121
And I'm not gonna
let her get screwed over
by some meathead jock

09:14.154 --> 09:17.725
who hasn't given
her the time of day
since middle school. Okay?

09:22.162 --> 09:25.866
Um, if you'll excuse me,
some of us have to earn
a living around here.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.606
"Meathead jock."

09:44.785 --> 09:48.055
Hmm. This one
is interesting.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.157
I know. It's terrible.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.759
That's not what I said.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.193
You didn't have to.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.962
I wish I could help you out,
but Jeremy's got me
prepping the line.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.632
Honestly, Carter.
I am completely
inexperienced.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.635
I have no idea why Gray
would give me something
this important to do.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.772
Um, maybe because
she trusts you? Hmm?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.707
You'll be fine, Jane.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.042
Awesome.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.178
Hello, Jane.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.747
Go on.
You can say it.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.884
You're overthinking
things a bit.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.052
What do you mean?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.722
This event, it's just
a little preview for
the money people.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.924
And the money people
want to feel like
their money is

10:24.992 --> 10:26.694
safe.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.765
And while the work
you've done here is
all very, very good,

10:31.799 --> 10:34.034
it's certainly not safe.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.937
Well, I'm not quite
finished yet. I just...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.806
Oh, oh.
Of course not.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.108
I'm sure you'll do
just fine. Good luck.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.823
Afternoon, Judge.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.857
You're late.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.425
Sorry about that, sir.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.427
Hey, Lulu.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.762
You two know
each other?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.864
Not really.
He goes to my school.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.234
Daddy, if it's okay,
I think I'll wait inside.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.703
I'm not really in
the mood for golf today.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.205
That's not like you.
Quitting before we
even tee off.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.107
I'm not quitting.
I just...

11:14.141 --> 11:16.844
I don't feel like
playing today, okay?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.180
Okay.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.756
(EXHALES)

11:33.293 --> 11:34.795
You gave me the wrong club.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.464
Uh, I'm pretty sure I...

11:37.497 --> 11:38.899
I know you, don't I?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.768
Nutter, isn't it?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.905
Yeah, you've been in my
courtroom a few times.

11:44.938 --> 11:48.742
My brother. Not me.
That's... That's not me.

11:48.776 --> 11:49.810
Uh-huh.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.981
Not yet.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.782
Lucky shot.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.863
Is that what you want?
To be in design?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.799
Because that
has potential.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.834
Thanks.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.805
Did I do something
to offend you, Jane?
Because if I did...

12:51.839 --> 12:53.907
No. Of course not.
I just, um...

12:53.941 --> 12:56.376
I really should
get back to work now.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.815
Hey. Can you explain
American women to me?

13:01.849 --> 13:03.116
MAN: I wish I could, dude.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.384
Forget it.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.861
I can see you, Jeremy.

13:14.862 --> 13:17.130
India!
What a nice surprise!

13:18.298 --> 13:19.867
Are you
avoiding me, Jeremy?

13:20.868 --> 13:23.003
No!
No, of course not.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.704
Good.

13:24.737 --> 13:29.843
Because I was thinking
tonight after work
we could get together and...

13:29.877 --> 13:33.013
Look. India. You and I?
The past few months...

13:33.981 --> 13:35.148
It's not...

13:36.049 --> 13:37.417
Well, it's
not really...

13:38.285 --> 13:40.854
Look, you're...

13:40.888 --> 13:43.256
Is it me or
is it hot in here?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.258
Just, uh...

13:45.292 --> 13:47.961
What were you
saying, Jeremy?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.931
Your

13:51.198 --> 13:52.966
place, or mine?

13:57.637 --> 14:03.010
It's classic
and simple and...

14:03.043 --> 14:05.245
Safe and expected.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.248
This is sad.

14:08.281 --> 14:11.018
This is my fault.
I put way too much on you.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.353
I just thought...
I thought I could call in

14:13.386 --> 14:16.890
and do a simple top edit.
I thought you were ready,
but...

14:16.924 --> 14:19.192
No, no.
I am ready. I am.

14:25.933 --> 14:28.969
"Safe and simple."

14:29.002 --> 14:32.005
The preview party is in
less than two days, Janet.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.373
Oh, it's Jane.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.275
And this collection
needs to be perfect.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.911
It needs to be fresh.
It needs to turn heads.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.948
And this is not
that collection.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.985
You know what?
It's all right.

14:45.018 --> 14:49.256
I'll call in India
and have her redo it
in the morning and then...

14:49.289 --> 14:51.191
Wait. Um...

14:51.224 --> 14:53.260
Just let me
take another shot.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.097
Please.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.999
Are you sure?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.234
Yes. I can do it.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.004
All right. Start over.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.138
Thank you, Gray.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.374
You better not
let me down, Janet.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.476
Now I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for dinner.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.111
Right, Patricia?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.946
Absolutely.
The cocktails
are waiting.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.247
Mmm!

15:14.281 --> 15:15.482
Hi, Janet.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.950
Hi.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.285
Bye, Bye. et.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.387
See you at
the preview party.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.092
Back to the drawing board.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.068
Hi.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.204
What do you want?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.072
I want to talk to you.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.707
Really?

15:40.740 --> 15:44.711
'Cause I thought
we didn't even
know each other.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.213
I was just trying
to throw him off.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.380
Well, you threw me off.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.715
Come on, Billy.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.483
You know my dad
would freak out

15:50.517 --> 15:52.419
if he thought
there was something
going on between us.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.054
You know how he is.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.189
Yeah. He's an ass.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.358
He's tough.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.028
And overprotective.
But that's only because
he wants what's best for me.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.164
And what is it
that you want, Lu?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.133
You.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.068
Yeah...

16:11.038 --> 16:12.339
I want you.

16:14.574 --> 16:19.446
* And besides
no one to watch the show

16:22.049 --> 16:24.751
* Why can't I let it go?

16:24.784 --> 16:28.355
* And why do I let it show?

16:28.388 --> 16:31.091
* My fear is the medicine

16:31.124 --> 16:34.161
* And I am my father's son

16:34.194 --> 16:37.430
* And all these things
that fall to pieces

16:37.464 --> 16:42.069
* I want to watch it grow

16:49.176 --> 16:51.111
I mean, he thinks
I have potential,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.380
which is flattering,
yeah, but...

16:53.413 --> 16:55.248
What's with you
this morning?

16:55.282 --> 16:56.449
What??

16:56.483 --> 16:58.218
What's goNothing.ith you?

17:00.453 --> 17:02.422
Jane,
it's nothing, okay?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.491
I just...

17:08.528 --> 17:10.097
I'll see you later.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.608
You're really gonna
make me say it?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.810
Come on, man.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.512
Now you wanna talk, huh?

17:26.346 --> 17:27.580
Did you tell anyone?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.082
Tell 'em what?

17:29.116 --> 17:30.650
What you saw.
With me and Lulu.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.387
Look, I don't care what
or who you do, all right?

17:34.421 --> 17:37.224
I just...
I don't get it.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.127
Guy like you with
a girl like Lulu Pope?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.662
(INDISTINCT)

17:44.631 --> 17:46.599
I'm surprised
you haven't told
everyone in town.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.469
It's her.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.105
She's the one
who doesn't want
everyone to know.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.207
Why would you agree
to something like that?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.676
Look, are you gonna
tell anyone, or not?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.447
Not.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.150
But I do want
a favor in return.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.488
He seems
like an okay guy.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.523
(GROANS)
I hate these things.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.160
Focus, Jane. Nick Fadden.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.129
Crap. It's Gray. Again.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.231
I'm telling you, Billy.
If I don't get this line
ready in time

18:18.265 --> 18:19.299
for Saturday's show,
it's over.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.434
Can you please focus on
the conversation at hand?

18:21.468 --> 18:23.603
You mean the conversation
about the high school Adonis

18:23.636 --> 18:25.538
that I've been
drooling over for
the past five years?

18:25.572 --> 18:26.606
That conversation?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.074
Yes. Thank you.

18:28.107 --> 18:32.245
Remember the time that Lulu
invited me to a sleepover
in fourth grade?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.913
She gave me
the wrong address!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.148
I showed up
to a Cluck Shack

18:35.182 --> 18:38.185
with my sleeping bag
and my Malibu Barbie,
ready to go,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.653
and there wasn't
a soul in sight.
It was humiliating.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.290
All because I allowed
myself to believe,
for one minute,

18:43.323 --> 18:45.358
that they could ever
treat us like one of them.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.594
And this?
This feels a little
bit like that.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.429
You think
I'm pranking you?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.564
Of course not. It's...

18:51.598 --> 18:53.566
It sounds too good
to be true, okay?

18:53.600 --> 18:56.469
Nick is gorgeous
and popular

18:56.503 --> 18:59.306
and I can barely complete
sentences around him.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.674
Besides,
you hate those guys.
Why do you even care?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.476
I don't.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.214
And why would he talk
to you about it,
of all people?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.549
I don't know.
Maybe he's, like,
nervous or something?

19:09.582 --> 19:11.418
In a town
full of rich jocks,

19:11.451 --> 19:15.322
Nick is the richest
and jockiest of them all.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.689
And I am
Little Orphan Annie

19:16.723 --> 19:19.559
who gawks at him
every day in AP English.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.495
Why would he be
nervous about me?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.733
What?

19:27.634 --> 19:29.101
Nothing.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.739
(SIGHS) Look, as much
as I would love to talk
about Nick Fadden all day,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.641
every day,
for the rest of time,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.676
I have a fashion
line to prep for in
less than four days.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.378
I have to go!

20:11.010 --> 20:12.645
(LINE RINGING)

20:14.714 --> 20:16.683
Where are you, Gray?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.252
Hmm.
This is what she does.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.388
Hangs you out there.
All alone.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.424
Succeed or die.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.495
You aren't the first.
Or the last.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.264
The faces are different,
but the stories are
all the same.

20:31.298 --> 20:34.634
Megan.
Oh, poor Megan.

20:34.667 --> 20:38.638
One ill-timed layover
for Gray in Morocco
and Megan was gone.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.340
Then there was Alexander.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.275
He lasted
three whole days.

20:42.309 --> 20:46.813
Until he made the
huge mistake of confusing
burgundy with magenta.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.781
You think Gray's having
you put together this line

20:48.815 --> 20:51.284
because she wants
you to succeed?

20:51.851 --> 20:54.721
Sweetie, think again.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.625
Why would I
listen to you?

20:58.658 --> 20:59.759
You want me to fail.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.695
True.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.664
But don't say
I didn't warn you.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.540
Then what did he say?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.675
We've gone
over it 50 times.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.845
He asked about Jane.
That's it.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.613
Why?

21:20.647 --> 21:25.552
Lulu.
I told you Jane is
off-limits, okay?

21:25.585 --> 21:27.086
Fine. Whatever.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.689
As long as Nick
promised he wouldn't tell.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.792
He promiYes. right?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.727
Are you sure?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.729
You guess?

21:36.763 --> 21:38.698
This is serious, Billy!

21:38.731 --> 21:41.601
Nobody can know
about this. Ever.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.672
You're right.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.676
And you don't have to
worry about it anymore

21:49.709 --> 21:51.644
because there's
nothing left to tell.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.346
It's over.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.695
Looks like you
could use a hand.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.797
I'm fine, thanks.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.705
(SIGHS) Okay,
you're right. I could

22:18.738 --> 22:21.140
definitely use some help.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.810
And I have help to give.
What are the chances?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.515
All right.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.417
Let's have it.
What've you got so far?

22:30.450 --> 22:34.821
Well, I think
I've figured out the
first five combinations.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.355
And this one?

22:36.389 --> 22:38.825
I know. I just...
You know, I keep going back
and forth on the necklace.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.628
I like it.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.698
It's just
a bit expected.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.634
But we'll get there.

22:47.667 --> 22:51.771
* Flowers start to bloom
in every different hue

22:51.804 --> 22:55.675
* From violet
to pink and blue

22:56.943 --> 22:58.845
* I can feel a change

22:58.878 --> 23:01.581
* No I am not the same

23:01.614 --> 23:04.584
* I'm lucky to
be here with you

23:06.686 --> 23:11.858
* This feels right
feels so bright

23:12.692 --> 23:14.794
* Life is rosy

23:14.827 --> 23:17.830
* Beautiful
Yeah it's so wonderful *

23:17.864 --> 23:19.466
It's perfect.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.668
You did it.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.470
We did it.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.741
I mean, from
"I like you" to

23:28.775 --> 23:31.744
"I can hardly look at you"
in less than a week?

23:31.778 --> 23:33.946
I demand an explanation.

23:33.980 --> 23:38.518
I guess I'm in
a buy American
sort of mood.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.219
Jane Quimby, you are
breaking my heart.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.821
(LAUGHS) Hardly.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.624
Whoa. Uh...

You're with somebody.

23:51.864 --> 23:52.999
No.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.668
Oh, come on. I saw you.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.605
And India
the other night.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.241
That? No, no, no.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.812
India and I are
absolutely 100% over.

24:05.845 --> 24:09.582
Right. You know,
it didn't look very over
from where I was standing.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.851
Which was
right over there,

24:11.884 --> 24:13.853
just in case
you were curious.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.655
It was...

24:15.688 --> 24:18.791
You know what?
I'd actually rather
not talk about it.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.027
It wasn't
what it looked like.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.730
All right,
it was exactly
what it looked like,

24:23.763 --> 24:25.898
but you and I, Jane,

24:25.932 --> 24:27.800
we could have
something special.

something special."

24:35.642 --> 24:36.776
That bad, was it?

24:36.809 --> 24:37.910
It was kind of corny.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.879
Mmm-hmm.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.048
You know, this could
seriously damage my
reputation as a ladies' man?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.517
(CHUCKLES)
A ladies' man?

24:44.551 --> 24:46.653
I also like "chick magnet."

24:46.686 --> 24:47.920
That's a nice one.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.956
Because I'm a magnet
for chicks.

I try. You know.

It's by the couch.

dressed yet? We're gonna
be late for school.

Talk to me.

to see you, Rita Shaw.

your name this time.

You know, if this works out,
we'll end up being colleagues.
How great is that?

Great.

what I think, man?

I'm not gonna say
anything about what
I saw, you and Lulu.

I mean, no matter what
happens with Jane,
I wouldn't do that.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.744
Here's the thing
about Jane.

28:31.778 --> 28:35.748
She's smart
and she's beautiful
and she's amazing.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.851
And she has no idea.

Hi. (Hi.CKLES)

28:53.866 --> 28:56.135
So, I was wondering
if you were gonna
be there Saturday.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.137
Uh, yeah, totally.
Saturday.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.140
What's Saturday again?

29:01.173 --> 29:03.910
Oh, the, uh...
The dance.

29:03.943 --> 29:07.546
Oh, right.
Magical night.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.782
I was thinking maybe
we could meet there?

29:09.816 --> 29:11.818
You want to meet me?

29:12.952 --> 29:13.953
Yeah. You.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.857
Oh. Great.
It's a date!

29:17.890 --> 29:20.793
I mean, you know,
metaphorically speaking.
Not like a real date.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.129
Just like, you know,
you're gonna be there
and I'll be there.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.932
So we'll meet
there together.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.267
I'll see you
Saturday, Jane.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.102
Yes, yes,
you will!

29:34.106 --> 29:35.842
Or you won't.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.246
What exactly is the problem?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.982
JANE: The problem, Billy,
is that Winter Formal

29:43.015 --> 29:45.818
is the same night
as the fashion preview.

29:45.852 --> 29:49.021
And I already told you.
I cannot miss that party.

29:49.055 --> 29:52.058
Gray is counting on me
and I refuse to give
India Jourdain

29:52.091 --> 29:54.126
the satisfaction
of watching me fail.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.162
Then skip the dance.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.931
You already bailed
on me once this week.
What's the big deal?

29:58.965 --> 30:00.599
Are you kidding?

30:00.632 --> 30:03.870
Nick Fadden said,
"Meet you there."

30:03.903 --> 30:05.905
He wants to meet
me there.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.274
At the dance.
So, you know,
I have to go.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.976
So? What do you think?

30:10.009 --> 30:11.110
That you can't be
in two places
at once, Janey.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.412
That's what I think.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.884
Oh, no, no.
I know that look.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.051
I have a plan.

30:19.085 --> 30:21.320
Yep. That's the look.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.290
Look, Winter Formal here.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.859
Preview party here.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.396

30:30.429 --> 30:32.999
Oh, come on, Billy.
I couldn't have planned
it better if I tried.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.902
I'll just take a spin
around the dance floor,

30:35.935 --> 30:39.305
quick change in the bathroom,
and then race over in time to
prep for the fashion preview.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.207
Back and forth
a few times...

30:41.240 --> 30:43.876

gExactly.

in that old picture, right?

said more than the
occasional "hey, Jane"

seventh grade pool party.

much to remember.

It's because
you seem different.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.532
You asked why now,
and that's why.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.874
You best take your
eyes off my job.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.308
I don't know what your
assistant told you, but...

39:37.342 --> 39:41.613
Oh, please.
You're about as subtle as
Galliano's fall collection.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.549
Little word of advice.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.485
I wouldn't bite off
more than I can chew.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.455
Are we clear?

39:49.755 --> 39:51.523
Mmm-hmm.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.592
Good.
Now, where's Janet?

39:53.625 --> 39:54.726
Janet? Who's...

39:54.760 --> 39:56.862
Oh, please.
I'll find her.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.708
* Work it

40:11.743 --> 40:13.512
* Come on and work it

40:16.648 --> 40:17.749
* Work it

40:19.718 --> 40:21.487
* Come on and work it

40:21.520 --> 40:24.723
* Work it
Work it now

40:24.756 --> 40:26.592
Where've you been?

40:26.625 --> 40:28.827
They're going on now
and you're...

40:28.860 --> 40:30.696
WhatWhat?hat?

40:31.630 --> 40:32.664
That!

40:32.698 --> 40:37.536
This? This is
an outfit change.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.571
It's cute, right?

40:39.605 --> 40:42.708
It's quite gorgeous.
Whose is it?

40:42.741 --> 40:43.675
It's mine.

40:43.709 --> 40:44.910
Yeah, who designed it?

40:45.644 --> 40:47.613
Oh.

40:47.646 --> 40:50.849
Me, I guess.
I designed it.

40:52.884 --> 40:56.722
* You've been hiding
for far too long

40:56.755 --> 41:00.726
* Super sexy, girl
you know you're strong

41:00.759 --> 41:03.895
* Strut your stuff
and show them how

41:03.929 --> 41:08.667
* You're a superstar, baby
The queen of now

41:11.637 --> 41:12.871
I need you two! Pronto!

41:12.904 --> 41:14.873
We've got some
serious fashion fallout
happening back here!

41:15.741 --> 41:17.643
It's ruined.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.710
Oh!

41:18.977 --> 41:20.779
Now what?

41:20.812 --> 41:24.650
I'm one dress short.
We cannot send this
line out incomplete.

41:24.683 --> 41:28.554
* Work it, work it
Work it now

41:32.991 --> 41:34.693
Guys?

41:34.726 --> 41:36.662
Seriously,
what are you looking at?

41:36.695 --> 41:39.965
* Work it, work it
Work it now

41:41.733 --> 41:44.570
* Work it
Work it now

41:56.715 --> 41:59.851
* Work it, girl
and show them how

41:59.885 --> 42:03.955
* Come on and work it, girl
Miss fashion
you're the it-girl now

42:03.989 --> 42:07.826
* Work it, girl,
One day you're gonna
show them how

42:07.859 --> 42:13.699
* Come on and work it
work it, work it now *

42:13.732 --> 42:17.869
* Darling, I melt
right into you

42:18.937 --> 42:22.040
* Maybe it's wrong

42:22.073 --> 42:25.911
* But I can't keep it inside

42:25.944 --> 42:29.848
* Darling, I melt
right into you

42:31.149 --> 42:36.655
* The more that I try
I can't fight it *

42:38.857 --> 42:42.861
The nerve it takes.
Putting your own design
on the runway.

42:43.629 --> 42:44.763
Actually, I...

42:44.796 --> 42:47.766
You know what I think?
I think I was
wrong about you.

42:50.769 --> 42:53.772
I think you might be
cut out for the fashion
business after all.

42:56.141 --> 42:57.709
See you
in the office, Jane.

42:59.878 --> 43:02.047
She knows my name.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.982
She actually
knows my name.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.686
(EXCLAIMS) Congratulations.
You pulled it off.
Amazing!

43:08.687 --> 43:09.788
I have to go!

43:21.767 --> 43:25.637
* The snow is falling down
I pull you near

43:25.671 --> 43:29.708
* The city sounds
fade and disappear

43:29.741 --> 43:32.944
* City lights blur
behind your ears

43:32.978 --> 43:38.116
* Your lips are warm
even in winter

43:41.953 --> 43:43.855
* Even in winter

43:50.829 --> 43:53.899
* City lights blur
behind your ears

43:53.932 --> 43:58.103
* Your lips are warm
even in winter *
