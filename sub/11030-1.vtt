WEBVTT

01:01.668 --> 01:04.543
THE PARTY

02:01.710 --> 02:03.127
Bye, dad.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.585
Go on, hurry.

02:17.543 --> 02:19.960
Well? What happened?

02:20.585 --> 02:22.918
Nothing! Have you seen the traffic?

02:23.085 --> 02:25.168
What about Vic? And school?

02:25.585 --> 02:29.252
It's the first day. Do you realise?
We almost missed it.

02:29.418 --> 02:30.793
It's open upstairs.

02:34.252 --> 02:35.960
- Dear me...
- What?

02:36.127 --> 02:38.585
What was your last load, cod?

02:48.960 --> 02:52.877
If I get that bitch Rabuteau,
I'll shoot myself.

02:53.043 --> 02:55.085
That was a grandiose summer!

02:55.252 --> 02:57.252
- 23 in two months.
- 23 what?

02:57.418 --> 03:00.043
Softly softly, OK?
They'll think I'm posing.

03:00.210 --> 03:04.293
I hear Dellamare's dead nice.
You know her?

03:04.460 --> 03:06.543
- No.
- I had her two years ago.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.210
No great shakes!

03:11.043 --> 03:13.793
That's Mr Lehman,
the German teacher. Look!

03:14.002 --> 03:15.918
How handsome he is!

03:16.127 --> 03:17.918
Isn't he classy!

03:24.418 --> 03:25.460
Look at the swot.

03:25.668 --> 03:29.502
He's got a nuclear power station
fitted in there!

03:30.918 --> 03:33.043
Funny, eh? Very funny!

03:34.210 --> 03:36.002
Sixth is that way!

03:36.627 --> 03:38.668
Go on!

03:45.252 --> 03:46.418
Pénélope!

03:47.460 --> 03:49.877
Mum said to wait for me afterwards.

03:50.043 --> 03:53.627
Look, Samantha, you've got
on my nerves for 10 years.

03:53.793 --> 03:56.668
Now you're in big school,
shut up!

03:58.627 --> 03:59.752
Cow!

04:07.085 --> 04:09.335
Is there canteen today
for the 4th?

04:09.502 --> 04:10.585
Are you new?

04:10.752 --> 04:13.835
Me too. We'll ask.
Where were you before?

04:14.002 --> 04:15.293
Versailles. And you?

04:15.460 --> 04:17.918
Jules Ferry.
My name's Pénélope.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.918
- Hurry up.
- Shall we sit here?

04:35.877 --> 04:37.543
He's a bastard.

04:43.835 --> 04:45.085
King Kong!

04:45.877 --> 04:46.877
Sit.

04:48.668 --> 04:51.377
Hand out these forms.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.585
What's your 2nd language?

04:55.793 --> 04:56.793
German. You?

04:57.168 --> 04:58.168
Russian.

04:58.377 --> 04:59.377
Full name,

04:59.418 --> 05:00.918
parents' occupation,

05:01.127 --> 05:03.960
address, telephone.
- My parents are divorced.

05:04.168 --> 05:05.168
Mine too.

05:05.377 --> 05:07.377
Mine are pretty rocky.

05:09.502 --> 05:11.585
Put both addresses.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.002
- Are you an only child?
- Yes.

05:15.168 --> 05:17.043
My sister's a pain!

05:19.168 --> 05:21.168
Have you been out with a boy?

05:22.085 --> 05:24.418
I have, an English boy.
Called Warren.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.210
Like Warren Beatty.

05:26.377 --> 05:27.752
He was great!

05:29.835 --> 05:32.543
I see ten American films
per week.

05:32.710 --> 05:33.710
Ten!

05:33.752 --> 05:35.668
And Fridays from 4 to 5!

05:36.085 --> 05:37.210
Quiet!

05:39.335 --> 05:41.960
Where's my Bordeaux belt,
please?

05:42.127 --> 05:43.502
You're joking!

05:43.668 --> 05:47.377
I've got three extractions.
It's already ten past two!

05:47.543 --> 05:50.252
You should have taken a day off!

05:51.002 --> 05:53.168
I'm paid for what I do, remember.

05:53.335 --> 05:55.043
Here, put this up there.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.127
I'm not alone in the practice.

05:57.293 --> 06:01.043
Clients will go to Chaumeau.
And when I open my surgery...

06:10.877 --> 06:12.418
This is great!

06:14.252 --> 06:15.252
What is it?

06:15.293 --> 06:18.377
My comic strip.
"Nasty Old Men."

06:18.543 --> 06:21.002
It's great!
The two old blokes,

06:21.210 --> 06:22.377
the movement...

06:22.543 --> 06:23.835
You really think so?

06:24.002 --> 06:25.002
Fantastic!

06:25.085 --> 06:27.377
I sent it to <i>Pilote</i> and <i>Charlie.</i>

06:32.627 --> 06:33.627
Vic!

06:35.085 --> 06:36.793
It's my great-grandmother.

06:37.418 --> 06:39.210
Poupette, what are you up to?

06:39.377 --> 06:41.877
- Going to a recording.
- Great!

06:42.502 --> 06:43.335
Madame.

06:43.502 --> 06:45.460
- Bye.
- Bye. Goodbye, madame.

06:45.668 --> 06:47.627
Hello, my girl!

06:47.918 --> 06:49.502
Have you told my parents?

06:49.668 --> 06:51.043
With the moving,

06:51.252 --> 06:52.252
you know...

06:53.002 --> 06:55.793
- We'll dine at La Coupole.
- What's that?

06:56.002 --> 06:58.418
- How old are you now?
- 13.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.377
Oh, there's still time!

07:35.793 --> 07:36.627
Hello, Serge.

07:36.793 --> 07:40.460
Madame Valadier!
Your usual table?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.752
With pleasure.

07:42.460 --> 07:43.502
Arthur!

07:43.668 --> 07:46.460
- How are you?
- It's good to see you.

07:46.627 --> 07:47.627
Likewise!

07:48.002 --> 07:49.502
A wonderful cellist.

07:49.668 --> 07:53.335
- You know everyone!
- Sit down, my girl.

07:54.502 --> 07:55.543
Thank you, Serge.

08:02.002 --> 08:06.752
The first time I dined here
was in 1923, 1928. You don't care.

08:06.918 --> 08:09.460
I was like you.
My eyes wide open.

08:09.627 --> 08:12.543
- Who with?
- Paul Poiré. You know who he is?

08:13.210 --> 08:15.377
Dressmaker, pasha, patron...

08:15.543 --> 08:20.085
The son of Laurent de Médicis
and Orson Welles. See what I mean?

08:21.252 --> 08:23.543
He freed women from their corsets.

08:23.710 --> 08:26.543
- Did he take yours off?
- I never wore one.

08:26.752 --> 08:30.293
A dozen Belons,
steak tartar, no onions, fries.

08:30.460 --> 08:32.377
- What a memory!
- Mademoiselle?

08:32.585 --> 08:34.835
- Chicken chanterelle.
- And...

08:35.002 --> 08:37.668
half a Ladoucette, well chilled.

08:37.835 --> 08:39.877
Let's get drunk, eh?

09:43.377 --> 09:44.960
Slow down. They're there.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.543
He looked at me the day
I wore my track suit.

09:48.710 --> 09:52.252
I'd give anything
to be invited to that party.

09:52.418 --> 09:56.918
If they wanted to invite us,
they'd have done it before Christmas.

09:57.085 --> 09:58.918
- They're behind us!
- Really?

09:59.168 --> 10:02.335
They're going to catch us up.
Slow down casually.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.252
- Slow down!
- If I do, I'll stop.

10:05.418 --> 10:07.543
Please let them come to us...

10:07.710 --> 10:09.085
Hey! Vic! Pénélope!

10:09.252 --> 10:10.627
Wait for us!

10:13.627 --> 10:14.627
All right?

10:14.668 --> 10:17.085
- Yes.
- Nice track-suit.

10:17.752 --> 10:19.418
It makes my legs fatter.

10:19.627 --> 10:21.918
- Doing anything Saturday?
- Why?

10:22.085 --> 10:23.252
I'm having a party.

10:24.502 --> 10:27.002
- What time?
- From 8 to...

10:27.460 --> 10:29.460
When do you want to know?

10:29.668 --> 10:32.293
Tonight. We've too many guys.

10:32.502 --> 10:33.752
- Fancy it?
- Maybe.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.918
Call me tonight.
It'll be too late afterwards.

10:39.127 --> 10:40.543
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.793
- Yes!!
- Yes!!

10:45.960 --> 10:47.210
It'll be great!

10:47.377 --> 10:49.418
Did you see Raoul's jacket?

10:49.585 --> 10:52.335
And Jean-Pierre's blue eyes.
Dead nice!

10:52.502 --> 10:54.543
They're so cute!

10:54.710 --> 10:55.793
What's wrong?

10:56.168 --> 10:57.418
What's the matter?

10:57.585 --> 10:59.085
I've nothing to wear.

11:02.085 --> 11:03.085
Mademoiselle.

11:03.335 --> 11:04.752
Mr Guibert is waiting.

11:12.877 --> 11:15.335
No. Not the anti-smoking campaign.

11:15.502 --> 11:17.877
Not this week, with Guatemala.

11:20.377 --> 11:21.793
Out of the question.

11:28.502 --> 11:31.960
I know cancer kills more
than earthquakes.

11:39.127 --> 11:41.127
There's no Mrs Beretton here.

11:41.335 --> 11:42.418
That's me.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.585
Mum, it's urgent.
I need an answer.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.168
But before, swear you'll say yes.

11:52.377 --> 11:54.085
I'm in a meeting.

11:54.293 --> 11:55.710
Do you realise?

11:55.918 --> 11:57.960
Can I go to a party on Saturday?

11:58.127 --> 12:01.002
<i>- We'll talk about it later.</i>
- I have to know!

12:01.210 --> 12:02.960
Then the answer's no.

12:03.793 --> 12:04.793
Excuse me.

12:05.210 --> 12:06.210
Shit!

12:07.377 --> 12:08.668
There's a style.

12:10.252 --> 12:12.877
But one-off drawings don't sell.

12:13.668 --> 12:15.252
Maybe the major press.

12:15.418 --> 12:17.752
I also have a comic.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.543
- I've a few plates.
- It's not our thing.

12:20.710 --> 12:24.668
Go and see <i>Pilote</i> or <i>Circus.</i>
We do comic-strips.

12:26.335 --> 12:29.085
Your stuff is savagely intellectual.

12:29.252 --> 12:31.168
I want savage news.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.460
- Tomorrow?
- You've got some?

12:34.293 --> 12:35.335
I'll have it.

12:35.918 --> 12:39.002
Put a temporary in
and we'll see tomorrow.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.585
Goodnight.

12:40.752 --> 12:42.585
There's another patient.

12:43.002 --> 12:45.043
Can't she come back tomorrow?

12:45.210 --> 12:46.960
I think it's pulpitis.

12:47.627 --> 12:49.710
- Has Chaumeau gone?
- Of course.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.960
Right.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.460
- Are you diabetic?
- No.

12:59.252 --> 13:01.043
- Pregnant?
- No.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.918
- On tranquillisers?
- No.

13:04.085 --> 13:06.085
- Are you allergic?
- To Indians.

13:07.127 --> 13:08.168
And rope tricks.

13:12.085 --> 13:14.627
Have you prepared my tray?

13:20.252 --> 13:21.252
Doctor...

13:21.793 --> 13:22.918
Open wide.

13:23.668 --> 13:26.252
I have to go.
My train's at 5.32.

13:26.793 --> 13:28.835
Go ahead, Madame Leblanc.

13:29.752 --> 13:31.585
Does it hurt every day?

13:39.877 --> 13:43.085
Honestly, you're totally...

13:43.627 --> 13:45.543
I've been looking for months!

13:45.710 --> 13:48.793
I thought it was best
to creep away softly.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.585
- Without any noise.
- I like noise.

13:51.752 --> 13:55.335
The ring on the bell, shouts,
broken glass. It's lovely,

13:55.543 --> 13:57.293
a break-up scene.

13:59.210 --> 14:02.418
I waited for you that night.
A long time. 5 months.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.710
But now I'm leaving you.

14:05.918 --> 14:08.835
Good. Then we won't quibble
over the bill.

14:09.043 --> 14:10.960
But there's a debt.

14:11.335 --> 14:12.835
You owe me a night.

14:13.627 --> 14:14.710
Where do I sign?

14:14.918 --> 14:17.585
I want our last night, François.

14:18.752 --> 14:20.835
You mean a whole night?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.918
Now I'm living in Paris...

14:25.127 --> 14:27.335
21 rue Valette. 6th floor, left.

14:28.210 --> 14:29.460
Will the 26th do?

14:30.002 --> 14:33.752
It gives you time to organise.
Or would you rather I call

14:33.960 --> 14:36.418
to confirm? Odéon 18-12?

14:36.585 --> 14:38.418
No... Yes... Yes, that's it.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.627
But you don't have to confirm.

14:42.377 --> 14:43.627
I'd rather the 27th.

14:43.835 --> 14:45.085
The 27th?

14:45.293 --> 14:46.293
Yes.

14:50.460 --> 14:53.252
What's Géraldine wearing?
Pink dungarees?

14:53.418 --> 14:54.835
That's great!

14:55.960 --> 14:57.960
Oh, yeah. Obviously.

14:58.168 --> 14:59.335
It's easy for you.

15:00.627 --> 15:03.668
I tried to call you
so you'd go shopping!

15:03.835 --> 15:05.377
It's Pénélope.

15:06.502 --> 15:07.752
- Is Dad here?
- No.

15:07.918 --> 15:10.835
You'll look dorky
in a low-neck top.

15:11.002 --> 15:14.293
Vic, take this to the kitchen
and lay the table.

15:14.460 --> 15:17.377
I have to hang up. Bye.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.668
I'll call back.

15:19.793 --> 15:23.502
- Will you test my German?
- Not tonight, I'm...

15:23.668 --> 15:25.710
But I want a word too.

15:25.877 --> 15:27.127
Yes. Me too.

15:32.085 --> 15:33.960
Hello? It's for me.

15:36.127 --> 15:38.710
Really, Vic!
If Dad wants to call...

15:39.210 --> 15:40.210
Yeah.

15:43.585 --> 15:45.377
No. I've not tried yet.

15:45.585 --> 15:47.960
What are your pink dungarees made of?

15:48.835 --> 15:51.335
Have to go.
Increased police presence.

15:52.127 --> 15:53.335
Hi, Dad.

15:54.335 --> 15:57.918
I've been trying to call for an hour!
Excuse me.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.543
Pulpitis at ten past five!
Incredible!

16:02.710 --> 16:04.835
It's a factory not a surgery!

16:06.043 --> 16:09.252
Just like <i>Modern Times.</i>
One tooth! Another!

16:10.085 --> 16:11.377
What's for dinner?

16:11.543 --> 16:14.418
There's quiche.
Sorry but tonight...

16:16.335 --> 16:18.627
How did <i>VSD</i> go?

16:18.835 --> 16:20.502
I may have a chance.

16:20.668 --> 16:22.293
I'm seeing them tomorrow.

16:23.918 --> 16:25.252
Go on.

16:26.002 --> 16:27.043
Have you...

16:27.627 --> 16:29.502
thought about my moped?

16:29.710 --> 16:31.210
It's hardly pressing.

16:31.793 --> 16:32.793
Huh!

16:33.252 --> 16:35.168
She's got a dance on Saturday.

16:35.377 --> 16:37.710
- What dance?
- A party! Not a dance.

16:37.918 --> 16:39.210
Whose party?

16:39.418 --> 16:41.960
- A guy.
- What's his name?

16:43.627 --> 16:44.627
Raoul.

16:45.002 --> 16:46.502
Raoul. Raoul what?

16:46.752 --> 16:50.168
- Who cares!
- You have the address?

16:50.335 --> 16:52.335
No. But I'll manage.

16:56.085 --> 16:58.793
I have to telephone
the boy's mother.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.585
It's not afternoon tea!

17:00.752 --> 17:03.127
- Exactly. What time is it?
- 8 o'clock.

17:03.293 --> 17:04.293
Till?

17:04.335 --> 17:05.918
What will you say to her?

17:06.085 --> 17:09.752
"Has your boy invited
my little girl to his party?"

17:09.918 --> 17:11.418
I'll look pathetic!

17:11.627 --> 17:12.710
Mind your words!

17:15.085 --> 17:16.252
You can't go...

17:16.460 --> 17:19.418
Forget it.
You couldn't care less.

17:19.585 --> 17:20.960
You only think of you!

17:21.127 --> 17:25.002
You haven't even noticed
my fringe is shorter.

17:25.168 --> 17:27.377
I've nothing to wear.

17:27.585 --> 17:31.127
And you've no time
to cook me anything to eat!

17:31.835 --> 17:34.877
You don't care if I'm happy or not.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.002
What's up with her?

17:38.668 --> 17:39.668
She's 13.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.293
I'll go anyway!

17:41.460 --> 17:43.668
You'd better.
I said yes for us both.

17:43.835 --> 17:45.127
Your turn, Pénélope.

17:47.377 --> 17:48.877
Turn your head.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.335
Very good, Samantha.

17:51.793 --> 17:52.835
My feet hurt.

17:53.043 --> 17:54.127
It's you, Vic!

17:54.710 --> 17:56.835
She's being a pain today.

17:59.627 --> 18:01.710
No!
Don't rely on me for an alibi.

18:01.877 --> 18:04.210
- A what?
- Come on in.

18:08.710 --> 18:12.502
Véronique! Your E natural.
Start again at 2.

18:12.668 --> 18:15.168
A virgin at 26.
What can I do?

18:15.543 --> 18:17.418
I'll make you your tea.

18:19.627 --> 18:21.960
First: never admit defeat.

18:22.127 --> 18:24.127
Never admit anything, in fact.

18:24.293 --> 18:26.252
You've lost a battle, but...

18:26.418 --> 18:27.418
But what?

18:27.543 --> 18:29.252
You haven't lost the war!

18:29.627 --> 18:30.627
Secondly:

18:30.668 --> 18:34.752
don't lie unless you're certain
of not being caught.

18:34.918 --> 18:35.960
Thirdly...

18:36.252 --> 18:39.835
I've lost my place.
Oh yes! Something new.

18:40.543 --> 18:42.085
I don't understand.

18:42.252 --> 18:46.752
It's not a party, it's a birthday.
At 7.30, not 8 o'clock. His name?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.918
- Raoul.
- Then it's Bernard!

18:49.085 --> 18:52.543
Anything! As long as they
can change their minds

18:52.710 --> 18:54.502
without looking like fools.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.043
Oh, yes. I see.

18:56.210 --> 18:59.418
And most important of all:
the timing.

19:00.543 --> 19:04.293
<i>You risk your life on a moment.
Can you play baccarat?</i>

19:04.460 --> 19:06.085
<i>- No.
- I'll teach you.</i>

19:06.335 --> 19:08.710
<i>Never when they're on the phone</i>

19:08.877 --> 19:11.543
<i>or having a row
or brushing their teeth.</i>

19:11.710 --> 19:14.418
<i>- At breakfast?
- No. It's dangerous.</i>

19:15.085 --> 19:16.710
<i>Bath time is a good moment.</i>

19:16.877 --> 19:20.752
<i>The quiet, the humidity,
the intimacy...</i>

19:20.918 --> 19:22.293
<i>Ah! Cigarette.</i>

19:22.460 --> 19:25.877
<i>- A cigarette break is ideal!
- Yeah!</i>

19:27.293 --> 19:29.377
Oh, you've no more cigarettes.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.043
- Shall I get some?
- No. I stopped.

19:32.210 --> 19:34.168
It's tough, but...

19:37.210 --> 19:40.252
- What are you doing?
- I've almost finished.

19:43.210 --> 19:45.043
Shall I run you a bath?

19:47.377 --> 19:48.377
Why not?

19:52.335 --> 19:53.335
Say...

19:53.377 --> 19:54.377
Yes?

19:54.543 --> 19:58.293
For the party,
you could wear my green waistcoat.

19:58.502 --> 20:00.460
The one you like so much.

20:40.502 --> 20:42.585
Arnaud and Jean-Pierre!

20:43.668 --> 20:46.168
It's definite, then,
Pénélope's mother?

20:46.377 --> 20:48.460
Yes. She's picking us up at 11.

20:49.002 --> 20:51.460
No! It looks silly,
arriving with you.

21:01.252 --> 21:02.252
Right.

21:03.085 --> 21:04.252
There we are.

21:05.668 --> 21:07.710
Don't break your glass slippers.

21:07.877 --> 21:10.960
Can I stay? I'd rather
wait till they've gone in.

21:13.585 --> 21:14.710
Call us if...

21:14.918 --> 21:18.252
It's a party, not a gladiator fight.
Don't exaggerate!

21:19.627 --> 21:20.627
I'm going.

21:28.377 --> 21:29.918
What are you doing?

21:30.085 --> 21:32.710
Waiting.
I'm scared to go up alone.

21:33.002 --> 21:34.335
Not in your boots?

21:34.502 --> 21:37.585
- Shall we go?
- I hid from Jean-Pierre and Arnaud.

21:37.752 --> 21:39.627
- Like it?
- Very pretty.

21:41.877 --> 21:43.168
Wait, I can't.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.377
Oh, come on!

21:44.543 --> 21:47.043
- I'm going home.
- Come on!

21:55.877 --> 21:57.502
Hi there!

21:58.168 --> 22:01.002
- Are you together?
- No, but...

22:42.627 --> 22:43.627
He's looking at us.

22:44.668 --> 22:46.002
- Raoul.
- Who?

22:46.168 --> 22:47.168
Raoul!

22:47.960 --> 22:50.085
He's definitely looking at me.

22:50.627 --> 22:52.127
He looks like Redford.

22:53.210 --> 22:54.502
A bit babyish.

22:55.293 --> 22:57.168
Aren't you at the cinema?

22:57.335 --> 22:59.168
We hid in the bedroom.

22:59.335 --> 23:01.668
Hunger drove us out this far.

23:02.168 --> 23:05.168
But if they see you,
it'll ruin everything!

23:05.335 --> 23:09.127
A party's like mayonnaise.
If it doesn't take, it's...

23:21.960 --> 23:24.585
Rock's better than
your crappy slow stuff.

23:30.168 --> 23:33.502
- What do you think?
- Rock? Great!

23:34.502 --> 23:35.918
No, of her?

23:36.127 --> 23:38.418
- I don't like redheads.
- No! Vic!

23:38.710 --> 23:39.710
Oh, yeah!

23:47.793 --> 23:49.877
- The love of your life.
- What?

23:51.335 --> 23:54.627
The love of your life.
I hear you're smitten.

23:55.335 --> 23:57.168
What? Joelle? You're crazy!

23:57.377 --> 24:00.252
She's ugly,
she's thick, she's crap.

24:00.460 --> 24:02.710
With her mongol's voice!

24:10.127 --> 24:11.418
She's mad!

24:17.627 --> 24:18.918
They're brilliant.

24:19.085 --> 24:20.960
They met at Thierry's.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.502
I was with Mathieu.

24:22.668 --> 24:23.502
You know him?

24:23.668 --> 24:24.668
No.

24:25.043 --> 24:27.793
I go in the bedroom with Mathieu.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.710
They're on the floor, going out.

24:30.877 --> 24:32.585
- So soon?
- So what?

24:33.543 --> 24:35.752
You should get to know him first.

24:35.918 --> 24:37.502
Oh, not necessarily.

24:41.252 --> 24:42.377
Shall we dance?

24:42.918 --> 24:44.210
Not on our own!

24:48.377 --> 24:49.627
Hey, Caroline!

24:50.877 --> 24:52.918
- Dance?
- Yeah.

24:53.085 --> 24:55.418
Say... you're better without glasses.

25:06.835 --> 25:09.918
- It's boring here.
- There's a party in rue Lecourbe.

25:10.752 --> 25:12.793
That's a lovely shirt!

25:13.918 --> 25:15.002
Want to dance?

25:15.502 --> 25:16.502
Yeah.

25:21.043 --> 25:25.627
Hey, Raoul wants to go out with you.
You want to go out with him?

25:25.793 --> 25:27.877
I don't. But I know someone...

25:28.418 --> 25:29.418
Who?

25:29.793 --> 25:31.835
- You swear not to tell?
- Yes.

25:32.002 --> 25:33.002
Pénélope.

25:33.585 --> 25:34.585
Oh?

25:36.543 --> 25:38.043
- Hey, Raoul.
- One second.

25:38.210 --> 25:39.793
Hey, stop!

25:41.585 --> 25:44.460
Just a sec.
We'll have an American break.

25:46.668 --> 25:48.252
Yes. You'll see...

25:49.752 --> 25:50.752
Music.

25:57.835 --> 25:59.918
- Will you ask Jean-Pierre?
- No.

26:00.085 --> 26:01.668
I'm going to ask Roger.

26:02.668 --> 26:04.043
What is all this?

26:04.210 --> 26:06.668
- The girls ask the boys.
- Oh!

26:07.210 --> 26:09.335
- Who are you asking?
- Nobody.

26:10.627 --> 26:12.877
Pénélope wants to go out with you.

26:13.043 --> 26:15.293
- What?
- Pénélope wants to go out.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.335
- Shall I tell her, then?
- Yes.

26:27.543 --> 26:29.502
Raoul won't go out with you.

26:29.668 --> 26:31.793
- I didn't ask.
- Vic did...

26:31.960 --> 26:33.918
- Bitch!
- Jerk!

26:34.335 --> 26:35.335
Oh, shit!

26:36.127 --> 26:38.960
- Is there a phone here?
- Over there.

26:39.127 --> 26:40.127
Thanks.

26:47.127 --> 26:50.752
<i>Dad? It's Vic.
You have to come for me.</i>

26:51.668 --> 26:53.752
- When?
<i>- Now.</i>

26:56.168 --> 26:58.835
- We have to go for her.
- Why?

26:59.710 --> 27:00.710
Why?

27:00.752 --> 27:03.668
Because it's lousy.
There's only 5th formers,

27:03.877 --> 27:05.168
useless guys.

27:06.043 --> 27:06.877
Oh...

27:07.043 --> 27:08.210
You're in bed...

27:10.252 --> 27:13.127
Half an hour downstairs?
OK. Hello?

27:13.793 --> 27:16.668
Then we'll go to Antoine's party
for a drink.

28:07.585 --> 28:10.127
It feels like only yesterday.

28:11.835 --> 28:15.793
I can see you in little skirts
and curly pleats.

28:18.252 --> 28:19.627
Do you feel old?

28:25.085 --> 28:27.002
A bit, tonight.

29:17.877 --> 29:20.793
- Will you get me a Coke?
- Yes.

29:40.418 --> 29:42.168
She's got a cheek!

29:42.335 --> 29:44.460
Maybe she's enjoying herself now.

29:45.710 --> 29:50.127
Next time we'll use a walkie-talkie
and patrol the neighbourhood.

29:50.460 --> 29:52.960
So in an emergency...

31:04.335 --> 31:07.002
- I'm going!
- Don't. She'd go mad.

31:18.418 --> 31:22.127
- It's engaged!
- If I get through, I'll call you.

31:23.585 --> 31:25.793
We're having a good time.
Come here.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.293
See you in a minute.

31:35.418 --> 31:37.377
Hello? Who?

31:37.752 --> 31:38.835
Vic Beretton.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.752
Don't hang up.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.793
Hello?
Call back in 15 minutes.

32:09.585 --> 32:10.585
She hung up.

32:19.627 --> 32:21.460
Well, I'm going up!

32:27.960 --> 32:30.918
She'll give me another bed jacket,
you'll see.

32:32.002 --> 32:33.627
As if I was disabled.

32:33.793 --> 32:35.543
It's dad's birthday.

32:35.710 --> 32:39.377
You'll see, it'll be a surprise.
She's nice, poor Gilberte.

32:39.543 --> 32:43.543
The daughter of La Castafiore
and Louis de Funès.

32:43.710 --> 32:46.710
- Dad's happy with her.
- I'm not surprised.

32:48.085 --> 32:50.210
Why are you so happy?

32:50.752 --> 32:53.710
That girl is floating.
It's obvious.

32:53.877 --> 32:55.418
Holidays are stupid.

32:55.585 --> 32:58.377
Can't you say anything but
"stupid" or "a pain"?

32:58.543 --> 33:03.127
That party was so brilliant.
Three days' holiday is a p...

33:03.293 --> 33:04.418
It's no fun.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.918
- What did you get for Grandpa?
- Damn! Sorry. I forgot.

33:10.752 --> 33:11.918
Be right back.

33:13.168 --> 33:14.210
Please.

33:15.585 --> 33:16.585
Etienne.

33:18.127 --> 33:19.168
Etienne!

33:20.210 --> 33:22.710
Don't forget the symposium tonight.

33:22.877 --> 33:24.710
No. I'm with you-know-who.

33:25.585 --> 33:28.752
We're going to the symposium
together.

33:29.710 --> 33:30.543
Oh, OK.

33:30.710 --> 33:33.293
- Doctor...
- Oh, sorry.

33:38.293 --> 33:41.960
Do you mind if I do
my breathing exercises?

33:42.335 --> 33:43.377
Please do.

33:44.377 --> 33:45.752
Diabetic?

33:45.918 --> 33:47.418
On tranquillisers?

33:47.585 --> 33:49.043
Are you pregnant?

33:52.085 --> 33:54.918
Mathieu wanted to go out with me.

33:55.085 --> 33:57.460
Not at your first party, though.

33:57.627 --> 34:00.043
Go out at your first party...?

34:00.210 --> 34:02.127
You know what that means?

34:02.293 --> 34:06.293
- Yes. Go to the cinema.
- No! That was in your day.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.127
Going out means
kissing them on the mouth.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.168
He's already gone?

34:14.793 --> 34:16.793
Put Dr Lagnier on.

34:22.168 --> 34:24.252
Yes. I'm seeing him tonight.

34:26.043 --> 34:27.252
Your father's at 7.

34:28.335 --> 34:29.627
OK. I'll tell him.

34:43.627 --> 34:46.210
Mum! You look gorgeous.

34:46.377 --> 34:47.585
Hello, my boy.

34:48.835 --> 34:51.502
Françoise, my dear.

34:56.043 --> 34:58.127
Hello, Poupette!

34:59.585 --> 35:00.710
Not too tired?

35:00.877 --> 35:04.335
Once and for all,
I'm perfectly well.

35:04.627 --> 35:06.668
Vic, dear, give me my bag.

35:06.877 --> 35:08.252
And François?

35:08.418 --> 35:10.543
He's coming by train...

35:10.710 --> 35:13.210
Help your mother. She might slip.

35:13.418 --> 35:15.877
- Look, Gilberte...
- Shush.

35:16.418 --> 35:19.835
I might have one foot in the grave,
but honestly!

35:21.043 --> 35:24.127
Poupette.
I've a surprise for you.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.335
Hello, Françoise? Did you call?

35:31.710 --> 35:36.043
What present?
Oh, yes. A purple package!

35:36.210 --> 35:37.752
<i>Where are you? At home?</i>

35:37.918 --> 35:41.752
Er... Yes. Of course...
I'm waiting for Etienne.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.585
- It's in the bedroom.
- In the desk.

35:44.793 --> 35:48.585
Don't worry, I'll find it.
Remember, it's 11.42.

35:48.752 --> 35:50.252
Come and fetch me.

35:50.418 --> 35:53.793
<i>- I'll be there.</i>
- I have to go, darling, because...

35:53.960 --> 35:55.210
my bath is running.

35:55.377 --> 35:57.835
<i>- Hello? Are you in the lounge?</i>
- Yes.

35:58.043 --> 36:00.960
My address book's on the table
in front of you.

36:01.127 --> 36:03.710
Give me Dr Giroud's number
for Gilberte.

36:03.918 --> 36:06.127
<i>My dermatologist in Versailles.</i>

36:07.127 --> 36:11.710
Oh, he's in Versailles.
Wait a second... Giroud...

36:13.085 --> 36:15.168
Oh, my dear, with your writing...

36:15.335 --> 36:16.627
Ah! Here!

36:17.293 --> 36:20.252
Dr Giroud: 951 17 80.

36:20.418 --> 36:21.418
<i>Thanks.</i>

36:44.668 --> 36:46.252
You don't have Rio Bravo?

36:46.460 --> 36:49.210
No. You'll have a western
for breakfast.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.460
I've other plans for tonight.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.585
Lovely truffle salad.

36:54.877 --> 36:58.293
You know what they say
about truffles? It seems...

36:58.460 --> 36:59.627
Yes. I know.

37:00.085 --> 37:02.668
A sleepless night
is like a boxing match.

37:04.627 --> 37:08.210
- Relax. You're nervous.
- No, but...

37:08.918 --> 37:10.793
A match lasts 15 rounds.

37:22.627 --> 37:23.710
Come here.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.335
Third round.

37:37.127 --> 37:38.127
What's that?

37:39.335 --> 37:40.502
That's my train.

37:40.918 --> 37:41.918
What train?

37:42.127 --> 37:44.627
Well, it's my father-in-law...

37:45.377 --> 37:48.127
- Your father-in-law?
- It's his birthday.

37:48.752 --> 37:51.377
- He's 58.
- You chose tonight.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.627
Exactly, because my wife...

37:54.793 --> 37:56.043
Well...

37:56.210 --> 37:58.668
- I'm no good at lying.
- Oh?

37:58.877 --> 38:02.710
Yes. I said I was
at a symposium on anaesthetics.

38:02.877 --> 38:04.543
They don't last all night.

38:04.752 --> 38:06.585
Especially on anaesthetics.

38:08.460 --> 38:12.210
So I thought...
two halves of a night and...

38:12.418 --> 38:15.127
Two little lies are better
than one big one.

38:16.668 --> 38:18.793
He's an odd guy, my father-in-law.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.585
His name's Colbert,
like the great Colbert.

38:21.752 --> 38:23.377
He says he's an ancestor!

38:23.543 --> 38:26.377
But his mother, Poupette...
Did I tell you?

38:26.585 --> 38:28.960
She doesn't care.
She always says:

38:29.668 --> 38:33.627
"I have no ancestors,
because I am one already."

38:33.793 --> 38:36.585
Could I speak to Mrs Beretton?

38:37.293 --> 38:38.293
Oh, it's you.

38:38.335 --> 38:39.793
The night nurse here.

38:39.960 --> 38:44.627
The doctor asked me to call to say
the fracture's been reduced.

38:44.835 --> 38:48.627
- Sorry?
<i>- The fracture of the right leg...</i>

38:48.793 --> 38:50.085
Who did you want?

38:50.252 --> 38:53.918
<i>- You are Mrs Beretton?</i>
- Yes, but...

38:54.127 --> 38:56.877
Your husband is still
under anaesthetic.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.668
He'll call you tomorrow.
Goodbye.

39:01.668 --> 39:03.335
I am good at lying.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.710
You're a real bitch.

39:07.710 --> 39:08.710
Oh, yes.

39:09.252 --> 39:11.627
Hello, Etienne? It's François.

39:11.793 --> 39:13.252
I need to see you now.

39:13.460 --> 39:14.877
Is it serious?

39:16.418 --> 39:17.835
Are you ill?

39:19.043 --> 39:21.002
What do you mean, "Not really"?

39:22.252 --> 39:23.252
What!

39:26.168 --> 39:28.627
Tell Mum we've been together
all night.

39:29.502 --> 39:30.543
What?

39:33.127 --> 39:34.668
Here. Bye.

39:37.877 --> 39:40.418
Isn't that Vic's dad?

39:43.293 --> 39:44.418
Yes.

39:44.668 --> 39:46.460
He's really sexy!

39:48.793 --> 39:52.002
It'll take 3 or 4 weeks.

39:53.377 --> 39:55.627
It's a fracture of the left fibula.

39:55.835 --> 39:57.627
The nurse said the right one.

39:57.835 --> 39:59.418
Can we change?

39:59.585 --> 40:03.918
No. It's the left.
Depends how you look at it.

40:04.085 --> 40:07.210
You'll see the x-rays.
It's a small crack.

40:07.418 --> 40:08.752
How did it happen?

40:08.960 --> 40:11.002
A pool of oil on the ring road.

40:11.168 --> 40:12.752
No. Etienne's unscathed.

40:12.918 --> 40:14.502
Luckily! But...

40:14.710 --> 40:16.877
you should see his car.
- You're mad!

40:17.043 --> 40:18.043
Totally!

40:19.627 --> 40:20.668
Did you see him?

40:20.835 --> 40:23.460
No.
I watched him till the bell.

40:23.627 --> 40:26.002
- I couldn't miss him.
- You're wrong.

40:26.168 --> 40:28.793
No. He had maths from 8 to 9.

40:29.002 --> 40:30.127
And gym from...

40:30.627 --> 40:31.627
There he is.

40:31.918 --> 40:33.085
Go on!

40:36.918 --> 40:38.877
- I can't.
- Don't be silly.

40:39.043 --> 40:41.210
Quick, tell me something!

40:41.377 --> 40:42.960
What do you want me to...

40:43.127 --> 40:45.335
That's funny! You said that?

40:45.918 --> 40:47.627
- Really?
- Hi.

40:47.835 --> 40:48.835
Hi.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.002
Hey, Raoul!

40:50.168 --> 40:51.335
- Hi.
- Don't worry.

40:55.543 --> 40:57.502
Hurry. We've an English test.

40:58.960 --> 41:03.043
Look at this chair.
Puts patients straight to sleep!

41:03.210 --> 41:06.502
- Like the car show!
- It costs more than a car.

41:06.668 --> 41:08.543
Patients come first with me.

41:08.710 --> 41:12.585
I don't want to be on my own
playing with that.

41:12.752 --> 41:15.460
- Coffee and the bill!
- It's coming.

41:17.085 --> 41:18.335
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:18.502 --> 41:21.418
- Big news.
- Sit here. I'm going.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.127
- I sold it to <i>Pif.</i>
- No!

41:24.918 --> 41:26.210
You did it!

41:26.377 --> 41:28.002
Bravo! Terrific!

41:28.335 --> 41:29.835
It's her comic strip.

41:30.418 --> 41:32.168
- Have you had lunch?
- No.

41:35.543 --> 41:39.210
12 pages a month for 4 months,
and if that works, an album.

41:40.002 --> 41:42.127
- Fantastic!
- Are you eating?

41:42.293 --> 41:44.335
Veal escalope with spaghetti.

41:45.752 --> 41:48.043
- How is he?
- Well... very well.

41:48.210 --> 41:49.210
I'm off.

41:49.252 --> 41:51.127
- Bye.
- Be right there.

41:51.377 --> 41:54.752
It's silly, driving and working
with a plaster.

41:55.752 --> 41:57.168
I saw the x-rays.

41:57.335 --> 42:00.502
It calcifies quickly.
I'll get a parking fine!

42:00.710 --> 42:01.960
- On your car?
- Yes.

42:02.127 --> 42:03.960
Yes. Well, I mean...

42:04.168 --> 42:06.335
It's smashed up, but it runs.

42:06.877 --> 42:09.460
Anyway... Tell me.
How much do you get?

42:09.627 --> 42:11.168
- 600 a page.
- No!

42:11.335 --> 42:12.502
Without the colour.

42:13.335 --> 42:16.668
I'll be going. I'm off to Bichat.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.293
Can I have a lift? I'm going nearby.

42:19.502 --> 42:21.668
Heck! It's 2 o'clock.

42:21.835 --> 42:23.960
I really have to go.

42:24.127 --> 42:27.043
Wait five minutes for her.
Will you pay?

42:27.585 --> 42:28.585
And for <i>Pif...</i>

42:29.793 --> 42:30.793
Bye.

42:33.418 --> 42:36.043
- You want another coffee?
- No, thanks.

42:49.002 --> 42:52.793
- You should have left a note.
- It doesn't matter. Carry on.

42:55.585 --> 42:59.460
I'll be right back.
You can save my space.

43:08.710 --> 43:11.752
It's an attic,
only 200 francs a month.

43:11.918 --> 43:15.710
It's brilliant for work.
Because with Vic, the telephone...

43:17.127 --> 43:18.960
What, is there a problem?

43:19.127 --> 43:20.127
No, no.

43:26.335 --> 43:28.918
Oh? He broke his leg. When?

43:29.085 --> 43:30.877
Saturday night, an accident.

43:31.043 --> 43:34.043
I saw him on Sunday.
Running like mad.

43:36.627 --> 43:38.335
Sunday? Are you sure?

43:38.543 --> 43:39.543
Yes.

43:41.377 --> 43:42.460
Hello.

43:42.627 --> 43:43.752
Everything OK?

43:44.960 --> 43:46.210
Can I have some?

43:46.960 --> 43:47.960
Are you alone?

43:48.543 --> 43:49.543
Yes.

43:50.793 --> 43:52.627
Are you free on Wednesday?

43:52.835 --> 43:55.877
I hate science-fiction.
But I didn't tell him!

43:56.252 --> 43:58.335
He's so handsome!

43:58.502 --> 44:00.543
Couldn't you take his photo?

44:00.710 --> 44:02.168
That way I'd see.

44:02.335 --> 44:04.085
I'd die for his photo.

44:04.543 --> 44:06.668
- Is he intelligent?
- Totally.

44:06.835 --> 44:11.418
He wants to go to hotel school.
His father's a chef. Well, a cook.

44:11.585 --> 44:12.793
I'll get it...

44:14.085 --> 44:16.085
There are always people

44:16.293 --> 44:18.085
ready to eat cake.

44:18.252 --> 44:20.168
- Is Mrs Valadier here?
- Yes.

44:20.335 --> 44:21.460
This is for her.

44:21.793 --> 44:22.793
Thank you.

44:22.835 --> 44:23.835
Who was it?

44:24.002 --> 44:25.252
Flowers, for you.

44:25.460 --> 44:26.752
Flowers?

44:27.085 --> 44:28.335
Blimey!

44:29.252 --> 44:31.335
- March 3rd.
- Jean-Louis?

44:31.502 --> 44:34.668
He never forgets.
I can't send anything to his home.

44:34.835 --> 44:37.793
- His wife's jealous?
- Not of me! She doesn't know.

44:37.960 --> 44:40.002
Really, Poupette! For 42 years!

44:40.168 --> 44:41.918
That's Backstreet.

44:42.127 --> 44:43.627
What's Backstreet?

44:44.543 --> 44:47.918
The story of some fool
who loves some imbecile,

44:48.085 --> 44:49.585
married to an idiot.

44:59.543 --> 45:02.418
Well, that's really good.

45:03.168 --> 45:04.168
<i>Raus!</i>

45:09.627 --> 45:12.252
Is it because
I'm seeing your parents?

45:12.418 --> 45:13.418
No, sir.

45:13.460 --> 45:16.335
It's the first time
you've learnt your German.

45:17.127 --> 45:18.127
It is.

45:19.668 --> 45:20.710
Run along.

45:25.418 --> 45:28.335
Hi!
Have we time for a drink?

45:28.502 --> 45:29.877
- What do you want?
- Coke.

45:30.043 --> 45:32.002
- I'll go.
- Are they nice?

45:32.168 --> 45:34.002
- Not bad.
- I like them.

45:34.168 --> 45:35.168
Hey!

45:35.210 --> 45:36.793
I like your whistle!

45:38.502 --> 45:40.043
- Hi!
- Hello!

45:40.418 --> 45:41.710
About time!

45:45.335 --> 45:47.877
Hey, this isn't a Disney film.

45:48.043 --> 45:50.502
- Your sister...
- What?

45:50.710 --> 45:53.377
What?
I've even seen <i>Ai No Corrida.</i>

45:55.627 --> 45:56.668
Three students.

45:56.835 --> 45:59.502
- How old are you?
- 13, and 2 days.

46:01.460 --> 46:03.502
- Thank you, madame.
- Thank you.

46:11.377 --> 46:12.877
Shall we sit together?

46:14.210 --> 46:15.502
We'll sit here.

46:17.085 --> 46:18.252
Are you coming?

46:22.710 --> 46:24.585
- Where's Caroline?
- Go past.

46:24.752 --> 46:26.585
- Where is she?
- Go on!

48:21.960 --> 48:23.002
Bastard!

48:23.793 --> 48:25.043
What's the matter?

48:26.543 --> 48:27.543
What is it?

48:38.877 --> 48:40.377
Look at those kids!

48:44.293 --> 48:45.835
- Bye.
- Bye, then.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.043
Oh, shit!

48:51.668 --> 48:53.960
I forbid you to ride mopeds!

48:54.127 --> 48:56.793
- This is Mathieu.
- Without a helmet!

48:56.960 --> 48:59.418
- Madame...
- You're a rotten rider.

48:59.585 --> 49:01.002
You'd best go...

49:01.252 --> 49:03.127
OK, bye. Goodbye, madame.

49:04.127 --> 49:07.918
And I'm cast as the nuisance!
That taxi could have killed you.

49:08.085 --> 49:11.835
You do nothing at school.
I can't trust you.

49:12.793 --> 49:15.877
You ruined everything!
Here, some éclairs.

49:19.418 --> 49:21.960
Fine, thanks.
See you tomorrow.

49:22.127 --> 49:23.168
Sorry.

49:23.335 --> 49:26.043
- Madame Beretton?
- Monsieur Lehman?

49:26.252 --> 49:27.460
That's me.

49:27.960 --> 49:30.293
- I'm late.
- It doesn't matter.

49:30.460 --> 49:32.668
Let's go to the main courtyard.

49:33.043 --> 49:34.168
After you.

49:35.877 --> 49:40.002
Don't tell me she's intelligent
but doesn't work hard enough.

49:40.168 --> 49:44.627
I wasn't going to say that.
Your daughter takes me for a fool.

49:44.793 --> 49:47.335
- Oh, no!
- Yes. A fool.

49:47.502 --> 49:48.627
But why?

49:48.793 --> 49:52.418
One day, she forgets her book.
Then her exercise book.

49:52.585 --> 49:56.585
Or it's a migraine.
Or she's looked after you all night.

49:56.752 --> 49:57.752
- Me?
- Yes.

49:59.085 --> 50:00.335
She's nice.

50:00.502 --> 50:04.377
Joyful, alive, happy as a lark.
But in terms of work...

50:04.543 --> 50:06.002
She's happy at school.

50:14.210 --> 50:17.418
I went out with him! 4 times
in the cinema, once on his moped

50:17.627 --> 50:19.168
and twice in the street!

50:19.335 --> 50:22.752
He's meeting me at 5
at the Comédie-Française.

50:22.960 --> 50:25.168
You'll recognise him,
he's handsome.

50:40.835 --> 50:43.127
From April 15
between 7 and 8 pm?

50:44.043 --> 50:47.002
- It's stuck!
- Leave it. You'll tear it off.

50:47.168 --> 50:49.835
- The physio asks if you...
- What physio?

50:50.002 --> 50:52.793
For your leg.
You have to book them.

50:53.627 --> 50:55.877
OK, every day from April 15.

50:56.043 --> 50:58.377
It was fine this morning...

50:59.127 --> 51:00.335
You're ready?

51:00.502 --> 51:01.585
Yeah...

51:04.252 --> 51:05.502
Goodbye, Dad.

51:06.418 --> 51:07.710
Don't break a leg.

51:08.293 --> 51:09.502
Sometimes it helps.

51:11.627 --> 51:12.627
Why?

51:12.710 --> 51:16.002
If I did, I'd be back sooner.

51:16.168 --> 51:19.168
But it was you...
Calcium. Very important.

51:19.335 --> 51:23.168
You begged us.
You've been on about it for 3 months.

51:23.335 --> 51:26.210
- But I'm glad.
- We could do without it.

51:26.377 --> 51:28.460
1400 francs, plus fees and skis!

51:28.627 --> 51:30.418
- Thank you.
- Is it Mathieu?

51:30.585 --> 51:31.877
Who's this Mathieu?

51:32.043 --> 51:34.002
I don't care about Mathieu!

51:34.460 --> 51:37.085
I'll get the metro.
It looks silly...

51:37.252 --> 51:38.960
Arriving with me? I know.

51:39.793 --> 51:40.835
Off you go.

51:41.502 --> 51:42.502
Goodbye.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.002
What's that?

51:52.668 --> 51:55.168
I rented it for 3 weeks.
Aren't you glad?

51:56.710 --> 51:57.710
Right!

51:58.918 --> 52:02.210
Scrambled eggs with truffles,
Parma ham, salad.

52:03.627 --> 52:05.502
We'll have dinner on a tray,

52:05.710 --> 52:06.710
OK?

52:08.002 --> 52:09.002
What?

52:12.585 --> 52:15.168
No. I love scrambled eggs
with truffles.

52:15.335 --> 52:16.335
And you...

52:20.710 --> 52:21.877
I love you.

52:31.710 --> 52:32.752
Shit!

52:39.502 --> 52:40.543
Oh, damn it!

53:09.002 --> 53:10.085
I'll get it.

53:13.918 --> 53:16.585
Françoise! It's François.

54:19.877 --> 54:21.877
That's enough! Shit!

54:25.918 --> 54:28.168
Where? La Main Jaune!

54:28.543 --> 54:29.585
No kidding?

54:30.002 --> 54:34.002
That's odd, the only nice girl here,
Sophie, goes all the time.

54:34.168 --> 54:35.502
You sneaked out?

54:35.710 --> 54:38.043
I've got a great plan.

54:38.418 --> 54:39.418
Wait.

54:40.418 --> 54:42.168
I have to pass mum's room

54:42.377 --> 54:43.877
to get to the door.

54:44.043 --> 54:47.668
I pretend I'm going to
the toilet. If she sees me,

54:47.877 --> 54:50.835
it's "Sleep-sleep. Wee-wee.
Night-night, Mum."

54:51.002 --> 54:52.210
Get it?

54:52.960 --> 54:56.210
I've hidden my clothes
just above the whatsit.

54:59.210 --> 55:01.377
And no one's any the wiser.

55:01.585 --> 55:02.752
But getting back...

55:02.960 --> 55:04.460
Same tunnel!

55:04.627 --> 55:09.418
Except I'm broke, since my sister
is racketeering as usual.

55:10.543 --> 55:11.710
How about you?

55:11.918 --> 55:15.293
Awful! There are no guys.
The monitors are all girls.

55:15.460 --> 55:17.127
- Coming?
- Be right there.

55:17.293 --> 55:20.793
No. I was talking to Sophie.
Mathieu? No news.

55:21.960 --> 55:24.335
It's proof he loves you.

55:24.502 --> 55:26.585
- What?
- The plaster, the car,

55:26.793 --> 55:29.043
everything! And such humour!

55:29.210 --> 55:31.210
As long as he makes you laugh...

55:31.377 --> 55:35.960
Look at them all!
Rich, intellectual, loving, wild!

55:36.127 --> 55:38.877
But a guy who makes you laugh,
believe me...

55:39.085 --> 55:40.793
I don't feel like laughing.

55:41.002 --> 55:42.877
A perfumer, isn't that funny?

55:43.085 --> 55:44.085
Not at all!

55:44.835 --> 55:46.127
Then you must act.

55:47.085 --> 55:49.585
I can hardly beat her up!

55:55.752 --> 55:59.918
Fervent romanticism, lightly spiced
with a note of exoticism.

56:00.085 --> 56:02.377
It has a flowery freshness, you see.

56:04.752 --> 56:05.752
Sorry.

56:06.043 --> 56:07.793
No. It doesn't matter.

56:08.210 --> 56:10.210
- May I?
- Please do.

56:15.793 --> 56:16.793
Delicious.

56:17.918 --> 56:21.210
- Again!
- Yes. Again.

56:21.377 --> 56:22.418
I'm sorry.

56:24.418 --> 56:28.252
- Do you have Empreinte by Courrèges?
- Yes. Of course.

56:30.752 --> 56:33.585
It's a very fine powder,
quite transparent

56:33.752 --> 56:35.585
and totally hypoallergenic.

56:36.335 --> 56:38.543
It smells odd.
Don't you think?

56:38.710 --> 56:39.710
I doubt it.

56:41.793 --> 56:43.585
I beg your pardon!

56:45.710 --> 56:47.418
You see, it is peppery.

56:47.585 --> 56:48.585
Wait...

56:53.293 --> 56:54.543
I'm so embarrassed.

57:00.293 --> 57:03.043
She's mad! Stop her!
Not the perfumes!

57:06.210 --> 57:09.127
Stop, or I'll call the police!

57:12.668 --> 57:13.668
Police?

57:13.835 --> 57:14.918
Oh, I forgot...

57:17.502 --> 57:18.710
Isn't this yours?

57:24.335 --> 57:26.418
She's mad! She's hysterical!

57:28.460 --> 57:30.918
Madame, did you see that madwoman?

57:31.085 --> 57:32.877
She's totally hysterical.

57:33.252 --> 57:35.043
Would you be a witness?

57:36.460 --> 57:38.668
She's ruined my shop.

57:50.335 --> 57:51.835
Here they come.

58:11.877 --> 58:12.877
Bye.

58:19.877 --> 58:21.418
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello.

58:21.835 --> 58:22.877
You look well.

58:23.043 --> 58:25.502
- This is Sophie. My parents.
- Hello.

58:27.085 --> 58:29.960
- Any calls for me?
- Mathieu, yesterday.

58:30.835 --> 58:34.627
What time? What did he say?
Oh, Mum! He called.

58:34.793 --> 58:36.543
- I'll call you.
- Come on.

58:37.918 --> 58:39.335
Your plaster's gone.

58:39.502 --> 58:40.585
It's finished.

58:43.127 --> 58:44.210
So...

58:44.877 --> 58:46.668
we've decided...

58:47.002 --> 58:48.585
Well... You decided.

58:48.752 --> 58:50.085
We've decided...

58:51.877 --> 58:53.293
mutually...

58:54.085 --> 58:57.543
that we needed a little break.

58:58.252 --> 59:00.210
Oh, are you going skiing?

59:00.710 --> 59:01.710
No.

59:02.335 --> 59:05.085
Your father and I need...

59:05.252 --> 59:06.918
Could I have a party?

59:07.668 --> 59:08.877
Listen, Vic.

59:09.543 --> 59:11.127
You have to listen.

59:13.210 --> 59:15.502
Dad is going away for a while.

59:15.752 --> 59:16.752
Where to?

59:16.835 --> 59:19.002
- A friend's.
- Etienne's?

59:19.168 --> 59:22.252
Definitely not.
That's in Hauts-de-Seine.

59:22.752 --> 59:25.043
An Alsatian committed suicide there

59:25.252 --> 59:29.085
because of the environment!
- I'm trying to explain to Vic.

59:29.252 --> 59:30.252
To Antoine's.

59:30.418 --> 59:31.585
Not for long.

59:31.793 --> 59:33.460
- A month.
- Two months.

59:36.085 --> 59:39.502
Well, one, two...
I'll see you at weekends.

59:39.710 --> 59:40.877
But why?

59:44.252 --> 59:45.252
Because I...

59:45.377 --> 59:49.377
Sometimes, when you've loved
each other a long time,

59:49.543 --> 59:51.627
it's good to...

59:51.835 --> 59:52.835
Well...

59:53.002 --> 59:54.585
It becomes a habit.

59:55.502 --> 59:57.460
You want to kick the habit?

59:58.168 --> 59:59.210
Yes.

1:00:00.835 --> 1:00:01.835
That's right.

1:00:02.793 --> 1:00:03.960
Right...

1:00:04.127 --> 1:00:05.627
But weekends...

1:00:06.627 --> 1:00:10.127
- What about them?
- Saturday is party night.

1:00:10.335 --> 1:00:11.918
So...

1:00:19.418 --> 1:00:21.502
You're not going to divorce?

1:00:49.710 --> 1:00:52.752
<i>Honestly,
my heart was in my mouth!</i>

1:00:52.918 --> 1:00:55.460
<i>It was like a film,
when the guys float.</i>

1:00:55.627 --> 1:00:58.460
<i>I hate slow-motion.
It's a real cliché.</i>

1:01:01.043 --> 1:01:04.377
<i>Hello? François Beretton.
Antoine isn't here.</i>

1:01:04.543 --> 1:01:07.335
<i>As for me, between 12 and 2,
I'm at Betty's.</i>

1:01:07.502 --> 1:01:09.460
<i>Between 5 and 7 at Francine's.</i>

1:01:09.668 --> 1:01:14.668
<i>If it's Angela, OK for tomorrow
for the candlelit lunch, darling.</i>

1:01:14.835 --> 1:01:17.210
<i>Claudine: sorry, honey,
I've no time.</i>

1:01:17.418 --> 1:01:21.002
<i>But if it's Françoise, then...</i>

1:01:21.877 --> 1:01:24.627
<i>When can I come home?</i>

1:01:41.543 --> 1:01:42.543
Ah, Poupette.

1:01:46.668 --> 1:01:49.960
- Pénélope saw them together.
- At La Main Jaune.

1:01:50.127 --> 1:01:52.960
- How old is she?
- Sixteen. Her name's Lydia.

1:01:53.127 --> 1:01:54.710
He looked smitten.

1:01:54.877 --> 1:01:56.460
- Gorgeous, too.
- What?

1:01:57.418 --> 1:01:59.627
She... You know...

1:01:59.877 --> 1:02:01.960
- She...
- Sleeps around?

1:02:04.335 --> 1:02:05.585
That's a bother.

1:02:05.752 --> 1:02:07.418
Front row seat!

1:02:08.460 --> 1:02:09.877
Is she that good?

1:02:10.043 --> 1:02:15.127
- Auburn, with eyes like that!
- Daughter of Delon and Mona Lisa.

1:02:16.002 --> 1:02:18.418
We're in the shit!
Temporarily.

1:02:18.585 --> 1:02:19.752
What do you think?

1:02:20.335 --> 1:02:23.960
- You're listening in, so come on.
- Well, really!

1:02:24.127 --> 1:02:27.668
- Did you speak to your mother?
- It's not a good time...

1:02:27.835 --> 1:02:31.043
- Make him jealous.
- That's from your era.

1:02:32.752 --> 1:02:35.877
So what tactics work nowadays?

1:02:52.835 --> 1:02:54.418
Madame Beretton...

1:03:33.627 --> 1:03:34.960
They're here!

1:03:35.460 --> 1:03:36.460
They're here!

1:03:36.793 --> 1:03:37.793
Again?

1:03:37.835 --> 1:03:40.877
A whole gang arrived.
Even Raoul's here.

1:03:41.043 --> 1:03:45.293
What? Yes. Lydia, of course.
It's a roller skate evening.

1:03:45.460 --> 1:03:47.918
And I met this guy...

1:03:48.085 --> 1:03:50.168
A blond Dustin Hoffman!

1:04:00.293 --> 1:04:01.293
Yes?

1:04:01.335 --> 1:04:02.543
Is Vic with you?

1:04:02.793 --> 1:04:04.377
No. Why?

1:04:04.543 --> 1:04:07.210
<i>- She's not here. I just got back.</i>
- Where were you?

1:04:07.418 --> 1:04:09.002
That's not the point.

1:04:10.085 --> 1:04:11.543
I'm very worried.

1:04:20.752 --> 1:04:21.752
Pénélope!

1:04:24.460 --> 1:04:27.168
My mother's gone out.
Pénélope too.

1:04:28.918 --> 1:04:32.460
- Who's calling?
<i>- François Beretton, Vic's dad.</i>

1:04:32.627 --> 1:04:33.460
Oh, it's you!

1:04:33.627 --> 1:04:34.835
- Where is she?
<i>- Vic?</i>

1:04:35.043 --> 1:04:37.377
<i>- Perhaps with my sister.</i>
- Where?

1:04:37.585 --> 1:04:41.627
Well... I'll tell you.
They're at La Main Jaune.

1:04:42.002 --> 1:04:44.543
I couldn't go, I have chickenpox.

1:04:44.710 --> 1:04:48.210
But be careful. Pénélope
said she was at your house.

1:04:48.377 --> 1:04:49.460
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:04:49.710 --> 1:04:50.710
No problem.

1:04:51.043 --> 1:04:53.002
- Goodbye.
<i>- Yes. Goodbye.</i>

1:05:05.168 --> 1:05:06.252
I should dance.

1:05:06.418 --> 1:05:08.835
I'll lend him to you.
What do you think?

1:05:09.918 --> 1:05:11.877
He looks like Donald Duck.

1:05:12.293 --> 1:05:13.418
OK.

1:05:14.543 --> 1:05:16.210
Will you ask my friend?

1:06:16.585 --> 1:06:17.835
Your dad's here!

1:06:32.585 --> 1:06:34.543
It's Vic's dad!

1:06:34.710 --> 1:06:36.710
- Vic's dad?
- Shall we dance?

1:06:36.877 --> 1:06:37.877
Coming?

1:06:41.835 --> 1:06:43.168
Dad, please!

1:06:47.210 --> 1:06:49.460
Come on, we're going home!

1:06:50.418 --> 1:06:52.252
One second. Just one second.

1:06:55.168 --> 1:06:56.460
I'll explain.

1:07:06.335 --> 1:07:08.252
You're totally mad!

1:07:13.335 --> 1:07:14.960
Who is that guy?

1:07:15.627 --> 1:07:16.627
No idea.

1:07:21.377 --> 1:07:22.752
She needs a father.

1:07:23.085 --> 1:07:25.752
A strong man,
who can rein her in.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:28.668
It's very important at her age.

1:07:29.085 --> 1:07:30.752
- Runny.
- I know.

1:07:31.085 --> 1:07:33.377
Respect and discipline
are important.

1:07:33.543 --> 1:07:36.293
But for that, you need a family.

1:07:39.293 --> 1:07:40.293
What's this?

1:07:40.710 --> 1:07:43.335
My angora sweater.
It gets rid of fluff.

1:07:48.502 --> 1:07:50.377
So you see...

1:07:50.752 --> 1:07:54.627
After what happened tonight,
I think I should...

1:07:55.377 --> 1:07:57.043
Don't mix everything up.

1:08:01.460 --> 1:08:02.877
It's throwing it down!

1:08:04.377 --> 1:08:06.835
And my wipers are broken.

1:08:09.252 --> 1:08:11.085
There. Goodnight.

1:08:13.918 --> 1:08:14.918
Goodnight.

1:09:08.293 --> 1:09:09.543
Damn! Shit!

1:10:19.460 --> 1:10:20.835
Wake up.

1:10:25.168 --> 1:10:26.877
What time is it?

1:10:27.168 --> 1:10:30.252
Six o'clock.
I don't want Vic to find you here.

1:10:34.252 --> 1:10:36.043
Would it be traumatic?

1:10:37.293 --> 1:10:39.293
She won't understand.

1:10:39.460 --> 1:10:42.002
If she sees you,
she'll think you're back.

1:10:45.210 --> 1:10:47.293
Well? Am I not?

1:10:47.627 --> 1:10:48.627
No, François.

1:10:50.502 --> 1:10:54.793
No parties, nothing. And Whitsun
with Bernard and Gilberte.

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:57.127
As for my birthday party...

1:10:57.293 --> 1:11:00.752
You don't just sneak out.
You cover yourself. In 1918,

1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:03.085
when I left with Fujita...

1:11:03.252 --> 1:11:06.668
- Who?
- A gorgeous Japanese painter!

1:11:06.877 --> 1:11:09.585
I said I was off on
a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

1:11:09.752 --> 1:11:12.335
- With Bernard's father...
- What do I do?

1:11:12.543 --> 1:11:16.585
At Whitsun, I'm playing in Brussels
for the queen.

1:11:16.793 --> 1:11:18.668
- You want to come?
- You bet!

1:11:18.835 --> 1:11:22.043
- But they won't let me.
- Leave it to me.

1:11:23.543 --> 1:11:26.418
- What do I do about Mathieu?
- You dump him.

1:11:27.752 --> 1:11:29.335
Is there no other way?

1:11:30.418 --> 1:11:32.418
It's your only chance, my girl.

1:11:38.502 --> 1:11:40.085
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi.

1:11:41.002 --> 1:11:42.043
Thanks!

1:11:43.043 --> 1:11:45.335
Right, I'm taking you to Corinto's!

1:11:45.877 --> 1:11:47.335
Mum isn't here.

1:11:52.085 --> 1:11:54.460
Well... dinner for two, then.

1:11:54.710 --> 1:11:57.168
- Right now?
- Yes. Get changed.

1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:13.710
And... It was here
she told me about you.

1:12:15.377 --> 1:12:16.377
Over there.

1:12:17.127 --> 1:12:18.418
Were you glad?

1:12:18.627 --> 1:12:20.002
How did she tell you?

1:12:21.377 --> 1:12:23.335
You know her. With a drawing.

1:12:23.502 --> 1:12:26.002
One day I arrived at the surgery...

1:12:26.168 --> 1:12:28.627
I must have been in my final year.

1:12:28.793 --> 1:12:32.627
There was a caricature of me,
with a belly like that.

1:12:33.293 --> 1:12:34.960
Everyone laughed.

1:12:35.168 --> 1:12:36.918
That night, we came here.

1:12:37.085 --> 1:12:40.752
She'd specially ordered
a plate of spaghetti

1:12:40.918 --> 1:12:42.127
with strawberries.

1:12:42.335 --> 1:12:44.210
You ate it?

1:12:44.793 --> 1:12:45.877
All of it! Awful!

1:12:50.377 --> 1:12:52.127
I won't have children.

1:12:53.293 --> 1:12:54.960
The day you meet...

1:12:55.127 --> 1:12:58.793
The day a guy's in love with me,
truly in love,

1:12:59.002 --> 1:13:00.502
I'll make him suffer.

1:13:02.668 --> 1:13:04.168
Are you unhappy?

1:13:05.293 --> 1:13:06.460
Is it...

1:13:07.668 --> 1:13:08.668
Mathieu?

1:13:10.835 --> 1:13:12.710
I've a little knot, here.

1:13:13.293 --> 1:13:14.627
It's unpleasant.

1:13:14.835 --> 1:13:17.252
Yes. Just here. Me too.

1:13:18.543 --> 1:13:19.543
Funny.

1:13:20.877 --> 1:13:22.127
And with you it's...

1:13:22.877 --> 1:13:23.877
Is it Mum?

1:13:29.002 --> 1:13:30.293
It's not easy.

1:13:31.293 --> 1:13:33.335
No. It's not easy.

1:14:25.127 --> 1:14:27.335
No. Please.

1:15:41.918 --> 1:15:43.002
Piss off!

1:15:46.502 --> 1:15:47.543
Come on!

1:15:50.502 --> 1:15:51.752
Hurry, get on!

1:16:00.293 --> 1:16:01.377
Thank you.

1:16:01.918 --> 1:16:03.585
They messed you up!

1:16:04.918 --> 1:16:05.918
Yes.

1:16:07.627 --> 1:16:09.043
If not for you...

1:16:11.085 --> 1:16:13.043
It's so rare that someone...

1:16:16.085 --> 1:16:17.085
Right!

1:16:17.627 --> 1:16:19.085
Can I buy you a drink?

1:16:21.293 --> 1:16:22.293
No.

1:16:22.835 --> 1:16:23.835
Go on.

1:16:24.585 --> 1:16:27.127
Can I do something for you?

1:16:27.418 --> 1:16:28.918
Yes. You know what?

1:16:29.127 --> 1:16:30.460
No.

1:16:36.502 --> 1:16:38.085
Leave my wife alone.

1:17:21.418 --> 1:17:22.793
Back already?

1:17:24.835 --> 1:17:26.460
My dance teacher's ill.

1:17:28.418 --> 1:17:31.127
Tell me about
the Spanish war of succession.

1:17:31.335 --> 1:17:33.918
The Spanish war of succession.
Wait.

1:17:34.418 --> 1:17:36.043
Louis XIV...

1:17:36.293 --> 1:17:37.460
The Austrians...

1:17:39.293 --> 1:17:40.877
The German princes...

1:17:41.168 --> 1:17:44.210
The messenger's coming in an hour.
So tonight...

1:17:44.710 --> 1:17:46.793
You've never any time for me.

1:18:11.502 --> 1:18:13.168
At school you're happy as a lark...

1:18:14.127 --> 1:18:15.127
Who told you that?

1:18:15.252 --> 1:18:17.502
You never smile or tell me things.

1:18:17.668 --> 1:18:20.877
You never ask for a kiss.
You cheer up

1:18:21.085 --> 1:18:22.960
when you talk about your party.

1:18:23.168 --> 1:18:26.418
How awful! I sound like
an old-fashioned mother!

1:18:29.710 --> 1:18:32.377
Can't I talk about
the situation with Dad?

1:18:32.543 --> 1:18:34.293
We can talk about anything.

1:18:34.502 --> 1:18:37.710
Only at the moment it feels wrong.

1:18:38.793 --> 1:18:41.002
I feel you... slipping away.

1:18:41.585 --> 1:18:42.835
I'm in a cage.

1:18:43.252 --> 1:18:44.085
Yes.

1:18:44.252 --> 1:18:45.710
But the door is open.

1:18:47.502 --> 1:18:51.502
And soon you'll go.
But now is a little soon.

1:18:51.710 --> 1:18:52.793
Don't you think?

1:18:53.918 --> 1:18:55.502
When will Dad come back?

1:19:00.793 --> 1:19:03.793
Hello. Very well, thank you.

1:19:06.793 --> 1:19:08.918
Say... your ex-husband...

1:19:09.127 --> 1:19:12.210
He's not my ex-husband.
We're just separated.

1:19:12.418 --> 1:19:14.418
He didn't seem to know that.

1:19:14.585 --> 1:19:17.502
We met last night.
And fought with thugs.

1:19:18.168 --> 1:19:19.502
What do you mean?

1:19:19.668 --> 1:19:21.418
He isn't hurt, is he?

1:19:23.418 --> 1:19:24.502
Who is it?

1:19:25.752 --> 1:19:27.460
How many were there?

1:19:28.668 --> 1:19:31.252
The black eye wasn't them.
It was him.

1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:35.043
He beat you up
or he saved your life?

1:19:35.252 --> 1:19:36.252
Both.

1:19:37.043 --> 1:19:38.168
Both!

1:19:41.377 --> 1:19:43.085
I'll call you later.

1:19:44.502 --> 1:19:45.668
That's right.

1:19:46.418 --> 1:19:47.502
Who was it?

1:19:48.002 --> 1:19:49.002
A friend.

1:19:50.168 --> 1:19:51.585
From the workshop.

1:19:52.168 --> 1:19:53.252
Do I know him?

1:19:53.668 --> 1:19:54.668
No.

1:20:09.835 --> 1:20:11.627
It's a friend's father.

1:20:11.793 --> 1:20:13.210
He's so sexy!

1:20:14.002 --> 1:20:15.043
Bye, then.

1:20:15.210 --> 1:20:16.210
Bye.

1:20:20.127 --> 1:20:21.127
Hello.

1:20:27.168 --> 1:20:30.710
We talked on the phone.
I'm Pénélope's sister.

1:20:32.127 --> 1:20:33.127
Oh, yes.

1:20:38.877 --> 1:20:40.335
Waiting for Vic?

1:20:49.085 --> 1:20:50.085
Coming?

1:20:50.418 --> 1:20:51.418
Wait.

1:20:55.002 --> 1:20:56.752
My chickenpox has gone.

1:20:56.918 --> 1:20:59.835
Now you've taken to
cradle-snatching!

1:21:00.002 --> 1:21:01.085
Don't!

1:21:07.127 --> 1:21:08.627
Say that again!

1:21:08.793 --> 1:21:13.335
In the dark, you can pass for trendy.
But you're just an old sex maniac!

1:21:22.377 --> 1:21:24.252
Get rid of this helmet!

1:21:25.210 --> 1:21:26.210
Come here.

1:21:26.668 --> 1:21:29.168
Stop it! Just stay still!

1:21:29.877 --> 1:21:31.918
- You'll hurt yourself.
- A fight!

1:21:33.918 --> 1:21:34.918
Stop it!

1:21:38.752 --> 1:21:40.627
Hey, that's enough!

1:21:41.752 --> 1:21:42.752
Stop!

1:21:45.168 --> 1:21:46.168
Have you finished?

1:21:47.127 --> 1:21:48.793
Drop it! Just go.

1:21:49.002 --> 1:21:50.543
What happened?

1:21:51.043 --> 1:21:52.335
What do you want?

1:21:52.710 --> 1:21:54.335
What's the matter, Dad?

1:21:54.710 --> 1:21:55.752
- Nothing.
- Here.

1:21:55.918 --> 1:21:56.960
Thanks, Vic.

1:21:58.168 --> 1:21:59.668
You know each other?

1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:01.960
He's my German teacher.

1:22:05.085 --> 1:22:07.627
That was Vic's dad? You knew?

1:22:07.793 --> 1:22:08.793
Yes.

1:22:10.752 --> 1:22:13.043
He beat you up!

1:22:13.210 --> 1:22:15.710
That's great! Great!

1:22:22.710 --> 1:22:24.752
This whistle means so much!

1:22:24.918 --> 1:22:26.460
This whistle is him.

1:22:26.918 --> 1:22:28.668
He put his mouth there.

1:22:28.835 --> 1:22:30.752
You saw the heart he stuck on?

1:22:30.918 --> 1:22:32.877
Oh, it's a gorgeous heart!

1:22:33.168 --> 1:22:35.002
When I saw the package,

1:22:35.168 --> 1:22:37.918
I could have cried.
In fact, I did!

1:22:38.085 --> 1:22:39.127
You called him?

1:22:39.293 --> 1:22:41.835
- No. He's gone to Cabourg.
- Cabourg!

1:22:42.002 --> 1:22:46.502
And we've got Amsterdam, Bruges,
<i>La Ronde de Nuit,</i> you'll see...

1:22:46.668 --> 1:22:48.293
And Brussels...

1:22:48.460 --> 1:22:53.293
- Juliet and Romeo were 15...
- Yes! And look what happened.

1:22:53.585 --> 1:22:55.460
Have you seen any Vermeers?

1:22:56.085 --> 1:23:00.335
We love each other like grownups.
Why can't we be the same?

1:23:00.502 --> 1:23:03.210
You can do anything at 18.
But at 14...

1:23:03.418 --> 1:23:05.710
Where would you be if you were 18?

1:23:05.877 --> 1:23:06.918
Cabourg.

1:23:07.210 --> 1:23:09.002
We'd meet on the beach.

1:23:09.168 --> 1:23:11.668
He'd run towards me,
take me in his arms.

1:23:11.835 --> 1:23:14.460
We'd forgive each other
and sleep together.

1:23:14.668 --> 1:23:15.668
Really?

1:23:15.877 --> 1:23:17.918
Why not? There's the pill.

1:23:18.418 --> 1:23:20.710
Sorry, I forgot about the pill.

1:23:21.293 --> 1:23:26.502
It protects against little babies
but not against little heartaches.

1:23:26.668 --> 1:23:28.960
Don't talk to me like a baby!

1:23:29.127 --> 1:23:31.252
I've never done that!

1:23:35.168 --> 1:23:37.168
- Where are you going?
- Cabourg!

1:23:46.210 --> 1:23:49.127
Could I speak to Mathieu?
Thank you.

1:23:49.377 --> 1:23:51.335
He's there! What do I say?

1:23:51.502 --> 1:23:54.710
What we said!
You're at a friend's in Deauville.

1:23:56.085 --> 1:23:58.335
Hello, Mathieu? It's me, Vic.

1:23:58.543 --> 1:23:59.543
Where are you?

1:23:59.710 --> 1:24:01.043
- Cabourg.
<i>- Really?</i>

1:24:02.210 --> 1:24:03.210
Who with?

1:24:03.543 --> 1:24:06.168
Nobody. I ran away.

1:24:06.335 --> 1:24:07.418
You're mad!

1:24:07.585 --> 1:24:09.877
<i>What! How did you get here?</i>

1:24:10.127 --> 1:24:12.502
Hitch-hiked. Can I see you?

1:24:12.710 --> 1:24:13.877
Yes.

1:24:14.543 --> 1:24:15.877
Where will you sleep?

1:24:16.585 --> 1:24:18.210
What do I say?

1:24:19.877 --> 1:24:21.293
Wherever you want.

1:24:23.835 --> 1:24:25.252
I've such a bad cold!

1:24:25.710 --> 1:24:28.210
In an hour at the casino. OK?

1:24:28.418 --> 1:24:30.460
- OK.
- Well, really...

1:24:30.627 --> 1:24:33.168
What got into you?
What about the friend?

1:24:33.335 --> 1:24:35.877
The friend was perfect.

1:24:36.793 --> 1:24:39.418
You said: "I give you carte..."
What?

1:24:39.627 --> 1:24:42.960
- Blanche. Not to spoil his holidays.
- Spoil them?

1:24:43.168 --> 1:24:45.627
You turn up. "Here I am."

1:24:45.877 --> 1:24:49.293
A woman giving herself
shouldn't be a source of worry.

1:24:50.085 --> 1:24:51.918
Well, if he loves me...

1:24:52.127 --> 1:24:53.752
Never, my girl!

1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:58.252
You have to take responsibility.
That's independence.

1:24:59.460 --> 1:25:02.502
- You're scared I'll sleep with him?
- What next!

1:25:03.377 --> 1:25:04.668
Be careful.

1:25:04.835 --> 1:25:07.710
At 14, there are children
who have children.

1:25:08.460 --> 1:25:09.835
So what do I do?

1:25:12.002 --> 1:25:13.877
You won't leave me?

1:26:10.335 --> 1:26:12.793
- Well? You didn't answer.
- What?

1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:15.168
Did you dump her
or did she dump you?

1:26:15.335 --> 1:26:19.127
It didn't happen like that.
Lydia was just... like that.

1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:22.293
How far did you go with her?

1:26:22.710 --> 1:26:24.543
Better call your parents.

1:26:24.710 --> 1:26:26.085
You went all the way!

1:26:26.377 --> 1:26:27.502
- Look...
- Dance?

1:26:27.668 --> 1:26:30.377
No, she's not dancing.
Come on.

1:26:30.585 --> 1:26:31.585
Where to?

1:26:31.877 --> 1:26:32.877
Here.

1:26:36.043 --> 1:26:38.002
Mademoiselle, how much do I owe?

1:26:54.043 --> 1:26:55.710
You'll be fine here.

1:26:55.877 --> 1:26:57.668
You rent them all year round?

1:26:58.168 --> 1:26:59.793
There's no one here.

1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:02.668
There could be prowlers.
Close the door.

1:27:04.210 --> 1:27:06.627
- What's that?
- My brother's duck.

1:27:09.585 --> 1:27:12.877
- What are you doing?
- Inflating the mattress.

1:27:16.460 --> 1:27:18.793
If you're cold,
there are things here.

1:27:19.418 --> 1:27:20.585
Put this on.

1:27:21.002 --> 1:27:22.793
I'm not cold.

1:27:23.502 --> 1:27:26.043
So what happened with your parents?

1:27:26.543 --> 1:27:27.793
Nothing. Why?

1:27:28.293 --> 1:27:29.335
Well?

1:27:31.043 --> 1:27:34.793
You don't get it. It wasn't them.
I came for you.

1:27:35.293 --> 1:27:36.502
5000 francs, banco.

1:27:37.085 --> 1:27:38.168
I'm in.

1:27:38.335 --> 1:27:39.918
Playing Banco.

1:27:40.752 --> 1:27:42.377
You're taking a risk.

1:27:43.085 --> 1:27:44.752
More than you think.

1:27:46.543 --> 1:27:47.752
What's wrong?

1:27:48.252 --> 1:27:50.377
I can't breathe through the nose.

1:27:52.543 --> 1:27:54.585
- What?
- Something stabbed me.

1:27:54.835 --> 1:27:55.835
It's the rake.

1:27:58.460 --> 1:27:59.752
Hold me tight.

1:28:00.543 --> 1:28:02.835
You spent all night with Lydia?

1:28:03.043 --> 1:28:04.043
No.

1:28:05.752 --> 1:28:07.293
I'm glad you're here.

1:28:08.418 --> 1:28:12.085
A night in your arms
is exactly what I...

1:28:12.252 --> 1:28:14.960
Well... it was worth the detour.

1:28:15.210 --> 1:28:16.543
I mean the trip.

1:28:22.502 --> 1:28:23.585
What's that?

1:28:24.377 --> 1:28:25.418
The mattress.

1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:27.502
I'll blow it up again.

1:28:30.668 --> 1:28:33.127
- It's 3 o'clock!
- You're not going?

1:28:33.335 --> 1:28:36.335
I'm working tomorrow.
I'm on a course.

1:28:36.585 --> 1:28:37.668
So what?

1:28:38.210 --> 1:28:40.585
I start at 6.
And there's my mother.

1:28:40.752 --> 1:28:44.085
- Your mother? I...
- You should call yours.

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.127
I did all that, took all those risks

1:28:48.293 --> 1:28:52.127
to come to a smelly cabin
with a flat mattress!

1:28:52.293 --> 1:28:55.043
You just turned up!
The cops will be looking.

1:28:55.210 --> 1:28:56.460
Some help you are!

1:28:56.627 --> 1:28:59.460
- I didn't ask you to!
- Look, just go.

1:28:59.668 --> 1:29:03.502
- I came here alone...
- You only came from Paris!

1:29:03.668 --> 1:29:04.668
Go on,

1:29:04.752 --> 1:29:06.043
your mummy's waiting.

1:29:08.877 --> 1:29:10.043
Shit!

1:29:26.918 --> 1:29:29.460
Vic, it's me. Let me in.

1:29:48.002 --> 1:29:49.043
Not asleep?

1:29:49.877 --> 1:29:52.002
Your mother's work is good.

1:29:56.710 --> 1:29:58.335
Aren't you asking?

1:29:59.293 --> 1:30:00.877
No. But I'm dying to.

1:30:03.043 --> 1:30:05.085
Don't worry,

1:30:05.252 --> 1:30:06.460
nothing happened.

1:30:08.918 --> 1:30:10.585
What did you do?

1:30:11.168 --> 1:30:12.502
I lost at baccarat.

1:30:13.710 --> 1:30:17.085
But I think I won a hand of poker.

1:30:26.252 --> 1:30:27.293
Come in.

1:30:33.210 --> 1:30:36.543
- Where shall I put this?
- Well... Here.

1:30:39.627 --> 1:30:41.335
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>
- I'm hungry!

1:30:50.252 --> 1:30:52.085
It's only 2 o'clock!

1:30:52.252 --> 1:30:54.293
Spend the weekend with us.

1:30:55.835 --> 1:30:58.877
We're going at 3 on Friday
to beat the traffic.

1:30:59.043 --> 1:31:00.793
OK, bye.

1:32:11.085 --> 1:32:13.377
<i>How about dinner for three?</i>

1:32:19.668 --> 1:32:20.835
Excuse me.

1:32:22.502 --> 1:32:23.752
Good evening.

1:32:24.418 --> 1:32:25.710
Thank you.

1:32:29.377 --> 1:32:30.418
Here!

1:32:31.377 --> 1:32:32.668
What is it?

1:32:34.127 --> 1:32:35.627
You must be hungry.

1:32:36.002 --> 1:32:37.752
It gives you an appetite.

1:32:39.210 --> 1:32:41.168
- Please.
- That's cute.

1:32:42.752 --> 1:32:44.335
Didn't the teacher come?

1:32:46.043 --> 1:32:49.710
- Eric? Why?
- We were meant to eat together.

1:32:50.835 --> 1:32:54.585
Didn't you send him a photocopy
of the drawing? After all...

1:32:54.752 --> 1:32:55.752
Stop it.

1:32:55.877 --> 1:32:59.043
- You'll say something awful.
- No. I'm quite open.

1:32:59.210 --> 1:33:01.752
Two dads is fine for a kid.

1:33:02.127 --> 1:33:03.460
Just look at Jesus!

1:33:31.585 --> 1:33:32.835
I was thinking of you.

1:33:34.043 --> 1:33:35.543
Please, say nothing.

1:34:04.502 --> 1:34:06.043
I'm expecting a baby.

1:34:06.502 --> 1:34:07.585
Already?

1:34:09.377 --> 1:34:10.668
Two months.

1:34:12.085 --> 1:34:16.085
So Agadir, beach and sun
are all very well, but...

1:34:22.377 --> 1:34:24.127
I'm offering a holiday.

1:34:25.293 --> 1:34:26.543
Nothing else.

1:34:26.877 --> 1:34:30.543
There are several families...

1:34:31.418 --> 1:34:32.418
Thank you.

1:34:32.710 --> 1:34:36.043
With a simple recognition test
for each.

1:34:36.210 --> 1:34:37.627
Did you reach him?

1:34:37.835 --> 1:34:39.793
- I got his mother.
- And?

1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:42.252
I said I was you. He's sick.

1:34:42.460 --> 1:34:46.460
- You think that's true?
- He had a cold in Cabourg.

1:34:46.627 --> 1:34:49.293
I'm not feeling well either.

1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:51.085
- Show me.
- What?

1:34:51.793 --> 1:34:53.627
- Nothing.
- Will he come?

1:34:53.793 --> 1:34:56.043
No use having a party without him.

1:34:56.210 --> 1:34:57.793
But everyone's coming.

1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:00.127
I don't care. I want him.

1:35:03.085 --> 1:35:05.543
Will this take long?

1:35:05.710 --> 1:35:07.543
No. I've just the...

1:35:07.710 --> 1:35:10.127
lighting rig and the compressor.

1:35:14.877 --> 1:35:16.043
There you are!

1:35:17.668 --> 1:35:19.960
But... what's all this?

1:35:20.210 --> 1:35:21.793
A dentist's surgery.

1:35:22.835 --> 1:35:24.668
But what about my party?

1:35:24.877 --> 1:35:27.210
I can't have a party here!

1:35:27.377 --> 1:35:31.585
I'm going to the paper.
I'll come back and find a solution.

1:35:34.502 --> 1:35:36.335
Shut the door behind them.

1:35:43.710 --> 1:35:44.710
Pénélope?

1:35:45.502 --> 1:35:48.627
A disaster?
Me too. What?

1:35:48.835 --> 1:35:50.210
<i>Chickenpox?</i>

1:35:50.377 --> 1:35:52.210
From my sister!

1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:57.960
Françoise, I wanted to warn you...

1:35:58.127 --> 1:36:01.210
- Excuse me!
- It's the leased equipment.

1:36:01.377 --> 1:36:02.210
Let's talk.

1:36:02.377 --> 1:36:04.460
- I've nothing to say.
- Come on!

1:36:08.502 --> 1:36:09.918
Listen to me.

1:36:13.127 --> 1:36:16.418
- Last night...
- Forget it. Everything's changed.

1:36:17.210 --> 1:36:21.210
I realise that...
What's changed?

1:36:21.543 --> 1:36:22.793
Excuse me.

1:36:24.043 --> 1:36:25.502
What's changed?

1:36:25.668 --> 1:36:28.418
Last night I had no lover.
Now I do.

1:36:33.085 --> 1:36:34.293
So last night...

1:36:34.627 --> 1:36:37.668
And your daughter,
the one you recognised,

1:36:37.835 --> 1:36:41.835
is having a party tomorrow
she's looked forward to for months,

1:36:42.043 --> 1:36:43.377
and you...
- Don't spoil it.

1:36:43.585 --> 1:36:45.252
You spoilt everything.

1:36:45.627 --> 1:36:47.668
There! I got the scan.

1:36:47.835 --> 1:36:49.710
It's a boy, I know it!

1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:53.085
Signature.

1:36:55.127 --> 1:36:56.460
Oh, my!

1:36:57.127 --> 1:36:59.377
For the cradle, it'll be rather...

1:36:59.835 --> 1:37:01.585
Seen the chin? It's you!

1:37:01.752 --> 1:37:03.710
It's not striking. Excuse me.

1:37:04.668 --> 1:37:06.210
- Isn't that enough?
- What?

1:37:06.377 --> 1:37:10.293
Your wife is beautiful. Talented.
And she's pregnant. By you!

1:37:10.502 --> 1:37:13.877
She makes the best scrambled eggs.
And she loves you.

1:37:15.210 --> 1:37:18.793
- She has a lover.
- Finally, some good news!

1:37:19.002 --> 1:37:21.085
We know whose side you're on!

1:37:21.293 --> 1:37:23.460
She did you a big favour.

1:37:23.668 --> 1:37:26.627
Right! I always dreamed
of being a cuckold!

1:37:26.793 --> 1:37:29.960
- You're a fool, I'm telling you.
- That's enough!

1:37:30.668 --> 1:37:32.960
You could never keep a man!

1:37:42.002 --> 1:37:43.002
I'm sorry.

1:37:43.168 --> 1:37:46.960
It makes me feel younger.
At my age, no one dares tell me off.

1:37:47.127 --> 1:37:48.502
Can I say something?

1:37:50.127 --> 1:37:52.210
This baby is your only chance

1:37:52.418 --> 1:37:55.502
to get her back.
So do it. It's almost too late.

1:37:56.335 --> 1:37:58.127
- Almost.
- What baby?

1:37:58.335 --> 1:37:59.877
Who's having a baby?

1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:02.502
We are.

1:38:06.377 --> 1:38:08.210
How's your sister?

1:38:08.752 --> 1:38:11.960
Disfigured!
She's even got one here...

1:38:12.127 --> 1:38:14.668
Metro Vavin, first floor.

1:38:14.835 --> 1:38:16.710
- Where do the chairs go?
- There.

1:38:16.877 --> 1:38:19.918
Tell the others, OK?
See you.

1:38:20.085 --> 1:38:21.585
There's no more ham!

1:38:21.835 --> 1:38:23.418
Oh, that's enough.

1:38:23.710 --> 1:38:26.127
Nobody will eat.
You mainly need Coke.

1:38:26.293 --> 1:38:29.335
- Did Géraldine bring the tarts?
- Yes. Don't worry.

1:38:29.502 --> 1:38:32.043
- You have to go.
- I still have time.

1:38:32.210 --> 1:38:34.252
The others will be here soon.

1:38:34.418 --> 1:38:36.210
- He'll come.
- You reckon?

1:38:37.293 --> 1:38:39.710
Goodbye. Enjoy yourselves.

1:38:40.127 --> 1:38:41.460
Will you write?

1:38:41.627 --> 1:38:42.668
Of course.

1:38:43.293 --> 1:38:45.002
I'll be back in a week.

1:38:45.168 --> 1:38:47.918
Now I'm 14 and going into 3rd...

1:38:48.127 --> 1:38:50.293
What about my moped? Oh, no.

1:38:50.835 --> 1:38:51.835
No what?

1:38:52.002 --> 1:38:54.877
- We'll see afterwards.
- After what?

1:38:55.085 --> 1:38:58.085
The baby.
You mustn't get upset now.

1:39:11.002 --> 1:39:14.043
I called about two tickets to Venice.

1:39:14.210 --> 1:39:16.085
- Mr and Mrs Beretton?
- Right.

1:39:18.043 --> 1:39:19.252
Hello!

1:39:21.127 --> 1:39:22.127
All right?

1:39:22.543 --> 1:39:23.543
Yes.

1:39:27.793 --> 1:39:28.960
Going on a trip?

1:39:29.793 --> 1:39:30.793
Yes.

1:39:31.502 --> 1:39:32.502
Oh?

1:39:34.793 --> 1:39:36.043
- Where to?
- Africa.

1:39:36.252 --> 1:39:37.293
Alone?

1:39:39.627 --> 1:39:40.793
No, with Eric.

1:39:42.752 --> 1:39:43.835
And you?

1:39:44.877 --> 1:39:45.960
What about me?

1:39:47.168 --> 1:39:48.960
- You're off too?
- Yes.

1:39:50.043 --> 1:39:52.418
- I'm getting my boots.
- Help me.

1:39:52.627 --> 1:39:53.627
Yes.

1:39:56.127 --> 1:39:57.460
I'm really late.

1:39:59.877 --> 1:40:01.668
I have to be at Roissy for 8.

1:40:03.335 --> 1:40:04.627
Well, look...

1:40:08.710 --> 1:40:12.127
My plane takes off at 9.
I'll give you a lift.

1:40:12.293 --> 1:40:14.043
Where are you going?

1:40:16.752 --> 1:40:18.043
Venice.

1:40:28.418 --> 1:40:30.043
Someone rang. Shall I go?

1:40:35.002 --> 1:40:37.835
- Happy birthday!
- What happened to you?

1:40:38.002 --> 1:40:40.252
I've got this thing
for 10 months.

1:40:40.418 --> 1:40:42.793
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1:40:44.377 --> 1:40:47.335
- Poupette!
- Happy birthday, darling!

1:40:47.502 --> 1:40:48.960
They're beautiful!

1:40:49.127 --> 1:40:50.835
I just recorded an ad.

1:40:51.002 --> 1:40:54.085
Debussy over a cascade of ravioli!

1:41:11.127 --> 1:41:12.877
I'll park the car.

1:41:14.252 --> 1:41:15.418
Thank you.

1:41:17.585 --> 1:41:18.585
Enjoy yourself.

1:42:05.210 --> 1:42:07.127
I'll skip the last day.

1:42:07.335 --> 1:42:10.002
I'm going.
It's the only day that's fun.

1:42:10.460 --> 1:42:12.002
- Shall we dance?
- Yes.

1:42:13.585 --> 1:42:15.335
Forget it! He won't come.

1:42:15.502 --> 1:42:17.002
Who do you mean?

1:42:19.377 --> 1:42:21.502
- Doorbell. Shall I get it?
- Yes.

1:42:26.585 --> 1:42:27.960
Great, isn't it?

1:42:49.627 --> 1:42:50.460
Going out?

1:42:50.627 --> 1:42:53.585
I'm dining with Jean-Louis.
His wife's at a spa.

1:42:53.752 --> 1:42:55.002
You're beautiful.

1:42:57.835 --> 1:42:59.210
Didn't he come?

1:42:59.877 --> 1:43:03.543
No, you're no victim!
You're a winner, don't forget it.

1:43:04.127 --> 1:43:06.668
