WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.926
All right, gang, huddle up.
This is for you guys.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.887
-Oh, we didn't get you anything.
-I did.

00:12.971 --> 00:17.267
Just a few little things I thought
you could use and then some fun stuff.

00:17.350 --> 00:21.855
-Sorry she's such a rotten friend.
-It's not a present, it's a job.

00:21.938 --> 00:25.275
You're on promo display.
I need you to put this together.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.276
I see that now,

00:26.359 --> 00:29.696
and admit sometimes I use lying
as a survival technique.

00:29.779 --> 00:30.739
Hmm.

00:30.822 --> 00:35.160
-Oh, someone has plans tonight.
-Gosh, are you running for comptroller?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.454
They're converting the store
to an H&R Block

00:37.537 --> 00:38.872
and she's gonna be the new boss.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.750
Ha ha. But no.
This is for a job interview.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.378
I'm up for head of communications
at Round-The-Clock Car Rental.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.589
This special guy deserved a change.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.800
-You're a special guy?
-Oh, it's an inside joke.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.720
-Timmy gets it.
-Yeah. Special Guy Day.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.263
It's just you made fun of it so hard,

00:55.346 --> 00:57.932
I never figured it would become
one of your go-to phrases.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.518
Like "Hammer time"
or "live, laugh, laugh."

01:00.602 --> 01:03.646
Plus, I didn't realize your résumé
was getting any bites.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.982
Ooh! Nice card stock.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.401
Smooth as a glass bottom boat.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.070
Thank you.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.864
Decided to give the old CV
a bit of a facelift

01:12.947 --> 01:14.699
and then got 50 printed out

01:14.783 --> 01:18.453
before realizing most employers
prefer them electronically.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.205
Background in marketing?

01:20.288 --> 01:22.832
-Bookkeeper?
-Oh! Director of Global Sales.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.709
You've never done any of this.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.963
For your information, back in 2015,
I had my own business.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.716
And before I realized
it was a pyramid scheme,

01:31.800 --> 01:34.719
I technically
was Director of Global Sales.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.138
I had to ship one box
of essential oils to Canada.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.015
Okay, fine, I padded it a bit,

01:39.099 --> 01:42.268
but there's only one word
on this résumé that matters.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.686
-"Harvard."

01:43.770 --> 01:46.523
Well, that'll do it.
Congrats. Glad it got you an interview.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.857
Second interview.

01:47.941 --> 01:51.361
I met the hiring manager
and have a meeting with the owner,

01:51.444 --> 01:52.779
which is a formality,

01:52.862 --> 01:56.866
and I hear that they usually
offer the job in the room, so...

01:56.950 --> 02:00.120
if I don't come back,
I haven't been kidnapped,

02:00.203 --> 02:03.164
I've just entered
my Beyoncé-gone-solo era.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.042
Oh, you're way too old to be kidnapped.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.462
It would be one thing
if you had money or were beautiful.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.757
You're pretty, sure,
but at your age you gotta be an 11

02:12.841 --> 02:14.968
to catch a kidnapper's interest.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.888
I'm gonna go hang my suit.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.149
Sno-Caps next to the Doritos?

02:29.232 --> 02:32.443
No. Sno-Caps go next to the Goobers
and Sugar Babies.

02:32.527 --> 02:36.698
You want customers to feel like
they're at the movies, not a truck stop.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.576
-Here's the damage.
-So, Donna,

02:39.659 --> 02:42.704
I meant to tell you,
I'm tied up with bank fees,

02:42.787 --> 02:44.831
but I'll pay you next week.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.166
-Next week.
-Yeah.

02:46.249 --> 02:50.336
Honey. There's a solar storm coming.
There may not be a next week.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.672
-Mark. Box them up.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.716
-Not today. Please.
-Come on.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.177
-Still got five cigarette shops to get to.
-I'm sorry.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.971
It'll take a lot more than "I'm sorry"
to save this marriage.

03:00.054 --> 03:03.391
Could you give me a hand, sweetie?
No. Okay. I'm fine.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.309
I got it.

03:04.392 --> 03:08.396
Okay, so the display we're
building is for <i>Thimble 2: Thumb Wars,</i>

03:08.479 --> 03:12.108
which is the delightful tale
of a country thimble, Emma Stone,

03:12.192 --> 03:15.653
in the big city, Billy Porter,
looking for her dream thumb.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.115
So, Billy Porter plays the city.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.576
You stick your thumb in
and it talks and lights up.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.829
I thought the display
would be a life-size cutout.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.164
What we're looking at

03:26.247 --> 03:29.709
is what we in the business
refer to as a giant puzzle.

03:29.792 --> 03:34.047
Lucky for you, you're working
with Connie Serrano, puzzle queen, PhD.

03:34.130 --> 03:38.176
Wow, didn't realize I was in the presence
of a queen and a doctor.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.763
My mom said I came out of the womb
with a keen eye and a puzzler's thumb.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.807
The key is organization and process.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.019
As long as all the pieces stay organized--

03:49.562 --> 03:51.814
Whoa, that came out of nowhere.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.318
It's a stationary object
that you walked into.

03:55.401 --> 03:59.072
Hey, jelly bean. I got your favorite.

03:59.155 --> 04:03.034
Mango surprise smoothie.
The surprise is frozen mangos.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.078
I don't have time for a smoothie.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.163
What? It's the perfect on-the-go meal.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.915
Even if you lose your straw,

04:08.998 --> 04:11.501
you take a tortilla chip and scoop it out.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.087
That's how your dad invented mango salsa.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.004
Uh-huh.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.174
-Ugh.
-Oh.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.094
Are smoothies canceled?
Did Gary at Smoothie Sips

04:21.177 --> 04:23.763
get caught up in another
animals-riding-unicycles scandal?

04:23.846 --> 04:25.974
Again? Those poor raccoons.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.309
Those raccoons get paid in smoothies.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.560
That's a sweet gig.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.021
Oh, well, two for me.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.818
Does Kayla seem more "Kayla" to you?

04:36.901 --> 04:38.194
Maybe she's vibing.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.947
That's a word I've seen on the Internet.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.034
-Timmy.
-Hey.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.328
Bag of Doritos and a box of Sno-Caps.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.496
That sounds good.

04:48.579 --> 04:52.792
Okay, so the thing is, you know
how we usually have snacks to sell you?

04:52.875 --> 04:56.796
Today is a little different
in that we have no snacks to sell you.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.465
Wow, and you call this place a restaurant?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.968
Looks like my dad's making lunch.

05:02.051 --> 05:03.386
-Come on.
-Wait a sec.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.556
I just remembered,
we got a shipment of candy

05:06.639 --> 05:08.349
I think you'll love. Okay.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.517
Don't go anywhere.

05:15.606 --> 05:16.482
-Carlos?
-Yeah.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.610
-Where's the <i>Thimble 2</i> promo candy?
-Oh, over there.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.779
I don't think
they put much thought into these.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.283
It's a kids movie
but these look like severed fingers.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.494
Looks like the remnants
of a sewing machine explosion.

05:29.037 --> 05:29.954
I'll sell them.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.582
These are supposed to be free
when people rent <i>Thimble 2.</i>

05:32.665 --> 05:34.876
Isn't selling promos against policy?

05:34.959 --> 05:38.087
Corporate store policy.
I'm in charge now, I've got solutions.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.424
Even if I'm losing my best employee
to a car rental place.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.178
Carlos, you are also my best employee.
There can be two bests.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.972
I am aware of your feelings towards Eliza.

05:48.056 --> 05:51.059
Feelings? What feelings?
I'm with Lena now.

05:51.142 --> 05:54.479
We haven't really defined things.
I'd love it if she was my girlfriend.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.564
Wait, is that something
people say at my age?

05:56.647 --> 05:58.566
Not looking to open this door.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.280
Where's Eliza?

06:11.662 --> 06:13.081
Sorry. I didn't ask.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.792
I was trying to do relaxation exercises

06:15.875 --> 06:18.628
and didn't realize
you have to breathe so loud.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.130
It's fine. Figured you didn't eat.

06:21.839 --> 06:22.673
Thanks.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.511
Is that The Rock carved
into a macadamia nut?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.806
Yep. Found promo candy.
It's a <i>Jumanji 2</i> jungle vine.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.350
Nuts and oats around a fruit jelly center.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.061
You'll love it. It's a healthy Nerds Rope.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.939
How long will it take my new boss
to learn my favorite treats?

06:38.022 --> 06:39.357
Fast. You're very vocal.

06:42.193 --> 06:47.323
I can't imagine Blockbuster without you,
but moving on is important.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.617
Yeah.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.078
I bet Aaron's excited.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.540
You can flag any Mercedes rental
as a future condo buyer.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.667
It's not insider trading
if you're married.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.960
He doesn't know.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.921
I tried to tell him,
but he was really amped

07:02.004 --> 07:06.717
about some DraftKings thing
and I couldn't get a word in.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.845
-Oh.
-Yeah.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.681
I bet when you do tell him,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.142
he'll be more excited for you than I am.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.518
So excited you'll be like,

07:15.601 --> 07:18.771
"Aaron, you are too excited.
Are you on cocaine?"

07:19.689 --> 07:21.441
I better get back to work.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.487
Do you mind shutting the door?
I wanna practice a story

07:26.571 --> 07:28.948
about how I dealt with conflict
in the workplace.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.325
-Sure.
-Thanks.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.459
Okay. Listen.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.962
It doesn't matter if it's puzzles,
dollar bills or laundry.

07:43.045 --> 07:47.925
-First thing is, you gotta sort.
-But the pieces are all gray.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.553
Lord, I know you reserve
the greatest challenges

07:50.636 --> 07:52.430
for your strongest puzzlers--

07:53.639 --> 07:57.351
-Ugh. Why is it so noisy?
-If you're not working, why not go home?

07:57.435 --> 08:00.438
My annoying mom is there
and she's obsessed with me.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.023
Like, "How was your day?"

08:02.106 --> 08:04.609
And commenting on my TikToks
with the star-eyed emoji.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.236
That's the most obsessive emoji.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.864
That's why I've been trying
to find myself an apartment.

08:09.947 --> 08:14.702
Do you guys know if we have a fax machine,
or what a fax machine is?

08:14.785 --> 08:16.078
An apartment? Wow!

08:16.162 --> 08:18.122
I usually reserve this
for purebred show cats

08:18.206 --> 08:21.042
but, hello, miss fancy pants.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.795
Are you sure you're ready?
It's a huge deal to live on your own.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.508
My boys thought they were ready
until they had to wash dishes.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.552
And wash their clothes.
And wash themselves.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.972
This apartment is amazing
and the utilities are included,

08:35.056 --> 08:37.808
except for weekend mail,
which is so annoying.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.937
Why don't you let one of us
go with you to see it?

08:41.020 --> 08:44.690
Yeah, that sounds weird.
All apartments include weekend mail.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.777
That's what Big Postal wants you to think.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.947
I think of Eliza as Blockbuster material,

08:51.030 --> 08:53.950
but I can also see her
as Round-The-Clock Car Rental material,

08:54.033 --> 08:57.870
which I know is saying a lot,
and, sure, she does our accounting,

08:57.954 --> 09:00.706
but honestly
I'd say she's more like our CFO.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.834
I don't know too much
about her essential oils company,

09:03.918 --> 09:06.254
but I do recall it being international.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.673
Look, Eliza's the real deal.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.967
She's the backbone of this place

09:11.050 --> 09:14.345
and I have no idea
how I'll manage without her.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.474
Oh, you just wanted to confirm
she works at Blockbuster?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.395
Yes, I got carried away.
My apologies for wasting your time.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.312
Love you.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.816
-Damn it, I did it again.
-Thanks, Tim.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.194
That was really sweet,
you only sounded mildly deranged.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.738
-I meant every word.
-Even when you told them you love them?

09:32.822 --> 09:36.200
Hard to tell. We really built a rapport
over the course of that call.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.452
-Hmm.
-Anyway, good luck.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.122
I'll need it if I ever wanna
get out of this dump, right?

09:41.205 --> 09:43.666
That's funny because it stings.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.209
Dedicated my life to this dump.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.712
-Sorry, I was joking.
-I know.

09:47.795 --> 09:52.216
So, when are you headlining
TJ Chuckle's Laugh-A-Torium?

09:53.217 --> 09:54.343
Oh, yeah, the fire.

09:57.221 --> 10:01.392
The red wire crosses with the green.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.728
-How long has she been at this?
-Hours.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.314
She even said
she had her puzzle diaper on.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.858
-Tell me that's a joke.
-<i>Stick your thumb in me</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:10.318
<i>-for thumbs of fun.</i>
-Yes.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.945
<i>Stick your thumb in me-- Stick-- Stick--</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:14.739
<i>Thumbs of fun-- fun!</i>

10:15.740 --> 10:19.535
I've been watching you struggle.
Do you mind if I take the reins?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.455
Touch my puzzle again,
and I'll kick your lurking ass

10:22.538 --> 10:24.624
to the Walmart parking lot
you were born in.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.800
All non-Blockbuster employees,
please clear the area.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.724
<i>Hello, kid.</i>

10:41.807 --> 10:45.019
We have these,
some <i>Mystic River</i> licorice rope,

10:45.102 --> 10:47.229
and a few boxes of <i>Soapdish</i> dinner mints.

10:47.313 --> 10:51.150
-Just the <i>Before Sunrise</i> gummies for me.
-I'm tempted to try some.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.486
They really capture
Julie Delpy's likeness.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.779
Oh, hey.

10:55.571 --> 10:59.033
Thought you would be
too busy with Ford Fiestas

10:59.116 --> 11:00.910
to take a victory lap so soon.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.954
-Yeah, I didn't take the job.
-Really?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.332
But you were so ready to move on.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.585
I was. But then I overheard
your glowing reference

11:09.669 --> 11:13.130
and realized
that I am the backbone of this place.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.966
But this seems like
such a good opportunity.

11:16.050 --> 11:20.262
Are you forgetting the block party?
Inventory? You need me.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.473
That company's a well-oiled machine.

11:22.556 --> 11:26.185
Blockbuster is where
I can make the greatest impact.

11:26.268 --> 11:30.106
It's hard to replace the meaningful
and satisfying work I do here.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.649
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.820
What's the movie where the weird space bug
with a glowing finger dresses like a lady?

11:35.903 --> 11:37.405
<i>-E.T.</i>
-No. The other one.

11:37.488 --> 11:41.367
-The other one?
-Why do I bother with you dumbasses?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.956
Like I said, meaningful and satisfying.

11:49.750 --> 11:53.003
Gosh, I gave her that reference
to help her get the job.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.047
I didn't expect it to derail her.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.634
She's the backbone of Blockbuster,
but she needs to diversify as a backbone.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.929
I can't be responsible
for her not being someone else's backbone.

12:02.012 --> 12:02.847
What do I do?

12:02.930 --> 12:05.516
I don't know,
what do they do in the movies?

12:05.599 --> 12:08.853
What's the opposite of going to an airport
to stop someone from leaving?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.730
Oh! Kicking you out of the house,

12:10.813 --> 12:14.442
saying "Eric, stop smoking so much weed.
Go get your job back at Ernst & Young."

12:14.525 --> 12:17.862
I need help convincing her to leave.
I gotta go fix this.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.160
-It's weird that he listened to us.
-Right?

12:24.243 --> 12:28.706
I got the apartment.
Oh, I can't wait to live by myself.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.916
You're gonna live by yourself? A teenager?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.710
While I, an adult,
live with three roommates?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.462
Living alone sounds so glamorous.

12:34.545 --> 12:38.883
You can put up as many pictures
of Jesse Tyler Ferguson as you want.

12:38.966 --> 12:39.842
Yes.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.596
After I go to Western Union
and send over the $100 pre-deposit,

12:43.679 --> 12:46.098
I can finally actually see the apartment.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.392
Wait, wait, wait. $100 pre-deposit?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.687
It's not normal to pay money
to just see an apartment.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.982
Well, no, a lot of places
do pre-deposits now.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.276
-My landlord told me.
-This doesn't sound right.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.861
We're just looking out for you.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.780
I won't let some jealous haters

13:00.863 --> 13:02.782
stop me from getting a place
that's so cool

13:02.865 --> 13:05.326
it's technically in two zip codes.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.998
You need to talk to Kayla.
She's trying to rent an apartment,

13:11.081 --> 13:12.124
and we think it's a scam.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.211
-We tried to stop her.
-Not that hard 'cause we're scared of her.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.506
Did Kayla put you guys up to this?

13:18.589 --> 13:22.343
Is she somewhere hiding, recording me?
Where you at Kayla, huh?

13:22.426 --> 13:25.763
-You trying to go viral again?
-No. This is serious.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.640
Oh.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.852
Then this is my moment. Kayla needs me.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.897
I gotta help my baby girl.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.778
I was just waiting around

13:40.861 --> 13:43.781
to see if someone was gonna
compliment me on my parenting skills.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.992
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.370
Okay, Kayla, here comes daddy. Whoo!

13:49.453 --> 13:51.789
A father's work is never done.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.376
Is anyone gonna finish his fries?

14:01.090 --> 14:03.342
I wanna talk to whoever's in charge.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.680
I wanna talk to the owner.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.519
Hi, Andrea. There's a man here for you.

14:13.602 --> 14:17.314
I don't know. I'll ask. You're not the guy
from Facebook Marketplace, are you?

14:17.398 --> 14:19.108
She says that shower head is listed as is.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.776
-No.
-He says no.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.070
He could be lying,
but I am inclined to trust him.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.406
-So who should I--?
-Oh, Andrea?

14:25.489 --> 14:27.783
-Mm-hmm?
-I need to talk to you about Eliza Walker.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.036
She's considering passing on the job,
you have to fight for her.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.124
Ah. We didn't offer her the job.
And believe me, she begged.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.084
She did not wanna go back
to Hollywood Video.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.295
-It's Blockbuster.
-Sorry.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.714
I got confused
because she only referred to it

14:41.797 --> 14:44.300
as the rotting corpse of '90s retail hell.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.678
-Really? That's not a joke?
-No.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.598
I was just with her.
She said you made the offer.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.349
From what I gleaned from her résumé,

14:52.433 --> 14:54.476
I get the feeling
Eliza says a lot of things.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.394
It was so chaotic,

14:55.477 --> 14:58.188
the only reason I brought her in
was to see if she was real.

14:58.272 --> 15:02.234
-She claims she went to Harvard.
-Well, that part is actually true.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.321
Wow. Unfortunately that is not
how she presented herself.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.281
So, feel free to take a pen.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.200
When you flip it upside down
the Sebring becomes a convertible.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.037
I can't believe she would slam Blockbuster
and lie to me.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.455
Mm-hmm. Okay, bye.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.880
What happened?

15:22.963 --> 15:24.840
I thought I knew what I was doing, but...

15:25.299 --> 15:26.759
I got scammed, Daddy.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.471
Bring it in.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.266
Come on, I know. I know.
Bring it in. Come on.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.227
We'll take care of it.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.564
What's the ETA on this?

15:40.648 --> 15:42.650
I wanna be the first
to stick my thumb in it.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.277
I'm gonna regret this, but why?

15:45.361 --> 15:48.781
Being first is a huge badge of honor
among Thimble Heads.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.325
The puzzle is done when I say it's done.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.703
I took the morning off work,
I need to get back to the oncology clinic.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.040
-You're an oncologist?
-There are Thimble Heads in every career.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.835
Let's just say that there was a thimble
in the White House.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.255
God, you--
Go wait over there until we're done.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.840
We need space.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.133
To build.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.554
Don't worry, I got this.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.100
And the sooner we finish,
the sooner that sicko will leave.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.142
I heard that.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.478
You're not wrong.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.313
I hate him.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.569
You're gonna give up a job
with health, dental, vision...

16:27.653 --> 16:29.655
-Don't forget paid time off.
-Yeah.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.949
It's crucial
for a healthy work-life balance.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.701
-...for this?
-Yep.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.786
Some things are more important

16:35.869 --> 16:38.872
than healthy benefits and upward mobility.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.376
Plus, you all depend on me
and I like it here.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.420
Huh, that's interesting.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.465
I was at Round-The-Clock Car Rental
and heard a different story.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.968
You won't believe the conversation I had.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.178
What would you have to talk about
besides her?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.264
I bet they were giving Timmy
a play-by-play

16:55.347 --> 16:57.766
of all the cutthroat negotiations
they used to reel her in.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.602
Eliza told us.
Hope you didn't burn too many bridges.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.604
Maybe you could put a good word in for me?

17:02.688 --> 17:07.109
I'm not sure Eliza has that kind of pull
over at Round-The-Clock Car Rental,

17:07.192 --> 17:08.694
but what would I know?

17:08.777 --> 17:10.529
I just work in retail hell.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.656
You talked to Andrea.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.741
Sure did.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.076
Okay. I can explain.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.412
Um...

17:21.206 --> 17:25.127
The truth is, it's tough out there and...

17:26.045 --> 17:29.048
I thought I could just
jump back into the workforce,

17:29.131 --> 17:32.259
but I-- Look, I don't deserve--

17:32.342 --> 17:35.054
The money they were offering you.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.681
No, you deserve more,

17:37.765 --> 17:39.683
which is why I put up the fight of my life

17:39.767 --> 17:42.061
to keep them
from headhunting my best employee.

17:42.144 --> 17:46.648
They were preparing a new offer
to change your mind, but I fought dirty.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.901
-Huh?
-I told them you'd say that.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.445
Eliza. Please.

17:51.528 --> 17:55.449
You need to stay at Blockbuster.
I will double your salary.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.284
Double? Really?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.203
Maybe not double, but something. Triple.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.288
That's more than double.
We'll figure it out.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.707
Wait. Are you sure?
You can barely afford to pay us.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.793
This feels like a gesture
more than anything.

18:05.876 --> 18:07.795
You heard him. We'll figure it out.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.255
-So Eliza's staying?
-Yes, she's staying.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.800
If she wants. This isn't a prison camp.

18:12.883 --> 18:16.136
Thank God.
Timmy would've crumbled without you.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.304
That is true.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.682
But I did do a pretty nice job of solving
the snack supply issue and I deserve--

18:20.766 --> 18:23.352
Ah! This candy broke my tooth.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.269
What?

18:25.979 --> 18:28.607
"<i>August: Osage County</i> candy corn."

18:28.690 --> 18:31.276
Great play,
that's where it should've ended.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.611
-I paid for these.
-Oh, wait.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.655
-No.
-You're gonna eat more?

18:34.738 --> 18:36.115
-No.
-Please don't.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.909
-You don't have to--
-Yeah, okay.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.248
I knew something was off.
I mean, you always ignore me.

18:44.331 --> 18:48.043
I've never seen you ignore mangos.
Why do you need an apartment?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.462
Mom is on my case, like, all the time.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.630
Typical Shaina.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.799
"Drink more water.
Stop going to bed at 2 a.m.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.135
Don't drive blindfolded
for a <i>Bird Box </i>challenge."

18:56.218 --> 18:58.095
"Stop leaving burger wrappers
on the nightstand.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.429
Stop buying ATVs.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.307
Stop bringing stray dogs home.
That is a coyote.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.227
You don't know the difference
between a coyote and a damn dog?"

19:05.310 --> 19:09.106
She's just always policing me
and I can't live in a police state.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.066
Yeah. I get it.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.610
I don't want to throw your mom
under the bus, but...

19:13.694 --> 19:17.531
But, believe it or not,
your mom is just looking out for you.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.409
Making sure you're safe.
Doing what a mother should do.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.996
But if you ever feel overwhelmed
and need a break from her,

19:24.079 --> 19:27.207
like I did, you can always stay with me.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.209
-I can?
-Yeah.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.713
-Your coyote hates me.
-Chris ran off months ago.

19:32.796 --> 19:36.550
I don't know what his issue was.
All I said was, "My food, your food."

19:36.633 --> 19:38.302
He got offended. Hmm.

19:38.385 --> 19:41.680
Ah. He was a great friend. Look here.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.934
I'm your dad.
And I'm gonna always want you around.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.103
You know what my best days are?

19:48.187 --> 19:52.900
My best days are when you're working
and I get a chance to spend time with you.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.861
-Ugh. Okay, no need to be thirsty, Percy.
-Yeah.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.073
-Can I stay at your place tonight?
-Let me think about it.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.033
Hmm...

20:01.116 --> 20:03.619
Yes, you can stay at my place tonight.

20:04.661 --> 20:08.665
And, listen, getting scammed
is nothing to be ashamed of.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.877
That means you trust people.
You have a trusting soul.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.297
Believe me,
your dad has been scammed a bunch.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.466
Almost made
the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:20.260
for being scammed
the greatest number of times.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.804
Turns out, that was a scam.

20:24.598 --> 20:28.894
-Look, I did it! It's perfect.
<i>-Stick your thumb in me for thumbs of fun!</i>

20:28.977 --> 20:30.187
Wow!

20:31.104 --> 20:33.315
-Wow...
-Mm-hmm.

20:33.398 --> 20:38.070
I mean, it's mostly held together
by duct tape and hope, but you did it.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.365
-No need to be rude.
-Finally. Can I have a turn now?

20:41.448 --> 20:45.327
I could smell you before I saw you,
you son of a bitch.

20:45.953 --> 20:50.249
And if anyone is sticking
their thumb in first, it's me.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.166
No.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.840
Is it supposed to sound like this?

20:58.924 --> 21:01.718
-Thimble's got me.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.638
-It's got me. Help!
-You are not the dream thumb.

21:05.639 --> 21:09.017
-No, Thimblewell, let her go. No. Pull!

21:09.101 --> 21:10.435
Help!

21:11.979 --> 21:13.188
Pull, pull!

21:21.321 --> 21:23.657
You monsters.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.997
Connie. Girl.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.457
I may have gotten a little out of hand.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.503
-What's really going on here?
-It's just that...

21:37.629 --> 21:40.090
growing up, my sister was good at school.

21:40.173 --> 21:45.512
My brother was amazing at baseball,
and puzzles were my thing.

21:46.263 --> 21:49.057
I guess I was worried
that I had lost my thing.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.895
First of all, based on
what you've told us about your sister,

21:53.979 --> 21:56.064
things haven't worked out for her.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.983
She does only have one husband now.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.652
And you didn't lose your puzzle skills.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.989
Even if you did,
you have lots of things you're good at.

22:04.072 --> 22:07.701
You're the only one who knows
how to laminate membership cards

22:07.784 --> 22:10.537
and you stopped that girl
from bullying us.

22:10.620 --> 22:14.541
Plus, you're fluent in Albanian
and too modest to tell us why.

22:14.624 --> 22:17.794
Oh, guys. That's so sweet.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.758
-Nice.
-Whoo!

22:26.720 --> 22:30.599
-You didn't have to help me with this.
-What? Of course I did.

22:30.682 --> 22:34.436
-I'm the backbone of this place, remember?
-How could I forget?

22:34.519 --> 22:37.230
This "rotting corpse of '90s retail hell."

22:37.314 --> 22:38.148
Yeah.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.817
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call it that.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.362
I really wanted that job

22:43.445 --> 22:46.198
and I think I let my nerves
get the best of me.

22:47.741 --> 22:52.287
But, you know, I'm so used
to taking care of other people,

22:52.371 --> 22:55.916
it was really nice
to have someone in my corner for once.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.501
You deserve it.

22:58.502 --> 23:02.672
Aaron thinks that he looks out for me,
but it's not in his nature.

23:04.299 --> 23:07.636
-Lena's really lucky to have you.
-Oh, yeah, I mean sure,

23:07.719 --> 23:10.472
we're just hanging out,
but sure, she's great.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.352
So, I was thinking about what you said

23:15.435 --> 23:17.896
the day we found out
this was the last Blockbuster.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.899
Maybe the store isn't just renting movies.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.109
People gather here,

23:22.192 --> 23:25.153
we offer an experience
that doesn't exist anywhere else.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.989
It's special.
We've gotta share that, you know?

23:28.073 --> 23:28.907
Do events.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.535
Maybe even one for Christmas,
for some old holiday movie.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.996
Like a less and more sad Comic-Con?

23:35.872 --> 23:37.374
I assume you have notes.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.917
No, no, no.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.337
After today,
I fully support all of your ideas

23:42.421 --> 23:45.132
that don't involve expired snack foods.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.135
Well, I'm glad, because I was thinking,

23:48.218 --> 23:52.639
maybe this could be your first order
of business as my assistant manager?

23:52.722 --> 23:57.102
Oh! More responsibility for the same pay?

23:57.811 --> 23:59.604
I love it. I'm in.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.943
A raccoon?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.862
Or Thimble is a Chucky.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.948
<i>Stick your thumb in me for thumbs of fun.</i>

24:11.867 --> 24:14.411
<i>Stick your thumb in me for thumbs of fun.</i>
