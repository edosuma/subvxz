system,

00:08.142 --> 00:09.543
sexually based offenses

00:09.577 --> 00:11.579
are considered
especially heinous.

In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.050
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.084 --> 00:17.451
are members of an elite squad

00:17.485 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.389
These are their stories.

backwards from 60,

until you reach the end.

What? No, no, no,
are you kidding?

02:01.255 --> 02:03.924
No, I asked you to walk her
at nine this morning.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.360
Yeah, okay.
Thanks a lot.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.296
- What's up?
- It's my dog-walker.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.231
Franny just peed
on my new shag carpet.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.633

diabetic granddaddy.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.868
- You got a granddaddy
that's still alive?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.637
- Grandpa Iggy Tutuola.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.739
95, healthy as a horse.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.374
- Except for the diabetes.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.376
- Where I'm from, diabetes is
like a head cold.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.578
- Okay, well I really want to
go save my carpet.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.924
- It is.
How can we help you?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.826
- My name is Savannah Ross.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.928
I was raped.

02:40.961 --> 02:46.200
*

02:46.234 --> 02:48.269
- This is all pro forma.
Just think of it as--

02:48.302 --> 02:49.803
- A conversation?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.939
If I had quarter for every time
I've used that line.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.707
- Hey, it's not like
I'm enjoying this--

02:53.741 --> 02:56.444
- Oh, I feel bad for you,
Michelle.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.447
My son almost got hit
by a cab.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.650
I grabbed his arm like
any mother would.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.686
And the next thing I know
Mary Poppins is reporting me

03:05.719 --> 03:07.855
to Albany and now
I got a DA's Investigator

03:07.888 --> 03:10.691
picking through my life looking
for some hidden treasure

03:10.724 --> 03:13.661
like it's out
of a Cracker Jack box.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.397
Okay, so excuse me
if I'm little testy.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.798
- And if this was another mom,

03:17.831 --> 03:20.534
would you object to this
inquiry as vociferously?

03:20.568 --> 03:23.437
- Look, just ask the big
question, Michelle, okay?

03:23.471 --> 03:27.408
So I can answer it
and we can both go home, okay?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.977
- Have you been physically
abusing your son?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.813
- No.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.317
- Noah told me you work
too much.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.454
- Show me another five year old
on the planet...

03:40.488 --> 03:43.491
who would say differently.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.228
- Tell me about Dr. Lindstrom.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.334
[tense music]

03:54.768 --> 03:57.638
*

03:59.507 --> 04:01.909
- Mm-mm.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.678
- You saw a shrink.
I gotta ask.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.517
*

04:11.919 --> 04:14.655
- I was kidnapped by
a psychopath.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.791
I was held hostage,
I was tortured...

04:17.825 --> 04:19.493
[inhales]

04:19.527 --> 04:22.330
and he threatened to do
God knows what else.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.032
- Everybody deals
with severe trauma differently.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.901
Did you feel Dr. Lindstrom
helped you?

04:28.936 --> 04:33.307
- I'm here about a black
and blue mark on my son's arm.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.743
- You're right, and it's
probably nothing.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.378
- But--
- Please, save it, Michelle.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.846
I know the drill.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.848
[emotional]
Okay?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.384
Try to make the interviewee
feel comfortable,

04:43.417 --> 04:46.487
make her think that your
interests are aligned...

04:47.988 --> 04:49.723
- Cards on the table?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.559
- Please.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.561
- Fine.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.498
**

04:59.433 --> 05:00.834
When they found William Lewis,

05:00.868 --> 05:04.438
you'd beaten him to
a bloody pulp with a bed rod.

05:04.472 --> 05:08.308
*

05:13.514 --> 05:15.816
- But what I realized...

05:15.849 --> 05:19.387
when I finally got
to the other side

05:19.420 --> 05:21.355
when I knew that I was
going to live,

05:21.389 --> 05:23.857
when I knew that I was
going to be okay,

05:23.891 --> 05:25.959
was that I wanted more,

05:25.993 --> 05:30.398
more than the job,
more than a relationship.

05:30.431 --> 05:35.135
The reason that I fought
so hard to stay alive...

05:35.168 --> 05:37.871
[crying]
was for Noah.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.944
And I hadn't even met him yet.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.447
So if you want to know
what I'm guilty of,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.449
I'm guilty
of being distracted.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.418
I'm guilty.
I was on the phone.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.821
And I took my eyes
off that boy for one second.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.123
That's what I did wrong.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.926
[cell phone buzzing]

06:00.728 --> 06:03.997
Yeah, Fin.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.166
Are we almost done?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.435
- For now.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.903
- I'll be right there.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.942
[dramatic music]

06:14.975 --> 06:22.382
*

06:58.619 --> 06:58.786
.

06:58.819 --> 06:59.186
- He put on music.

07:01.489 --> 07:04.458
Some kind of opera
or something.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.793
He brought it himself.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.895
He said that
he didn't speak German,

07:07.928 --> 07:09.763
but it was a song
about two lovers

07:09.797 --> 07:12.966
who could only be together
after they both were dead.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.504
- Can you describe
what he looked like?

07:16.537 --> 07:19.106
- I never actually
saw his face.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.513
- Do you remember anything
about his voice, maybe?

07:25.546 --> 07:28.181
Or smell?
A tattoo?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.183
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.786
Well, you know, we should get
you to the hospital.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.154
- Why?

07:34.187 --> 07:36.490
- Well, there's this thing
called a rape kit.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.660
It helps the doctors look for
traces of your attacker's DNA.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.663
- He made me shower...
for a long time.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.532
And I heard a ticking...

07:44.565 --> 07:46.133
like a timer.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.602
I really don't think that
they're going to find anything.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.238
- Well, you'd be surprised.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.674
- It wasn't my only shower.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.243
- How many?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.811
- Every day.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.214
- When did this rape take
place, Savannah?

08:01.248 --> 08:03.951
- Two weeks ago.
Tuesday.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.019
- Prick could be
in Kansas City by now.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.255
- Not that he had
much reason to run.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.090
- Before he left...

08:10.123 --> 08:13.561
He said that I should get
the lock on my window fixed.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.963
That's how he got in.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.732
He didn't want anyone
to break in and hurt me.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.669
- Okay, Savannah,
can you try and remember.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.904
Maybe you did get
a quick look at him?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.072
- I did.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.741
- What did he look like?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.911
- Prince Charming.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.081
- So he was cute?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.248
- No, the mask he wore.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.717
It was part of one of those

08:36.750 --> 08:38.586
Prince Charming
Halloween costumes.

[tense music]

08:40.253 --> 08:41.855
*

08:41.889 --> 08:43.323
- Something like...

08:43.356 --> 08:45.058
Like this?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.627
- Yeah.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.128
- So what color was his hair?
Maybe--

08:48.161 --> 08:49.797
- What have we got?

08:49.830 --> 08:51.298
- Savannah Ross.
She's 20 years old.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.866
She was raped two weeks ago

08:52.900 --> 08:54.267
in her apartment
by Prince Charming.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.669
- He wore a Halloween mask.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.270
- I thought...

08:57.304 --> 08:59.172
- Everything okay, Liv?
- Why did you wait so long

08:59.206 --> 09:02.075
to come forward about
the rape, Savannah?

09:02.109 --> 09:03.911
- He took my ID.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.946
He said if I told anyone what
happened, he'd be back--

09:05.979 --> 09:07.681
- Okay. Well you know what,
it's a good thing

09:07.715 --> 09:09.817
you came in, okay?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.652
We can protect you now.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.021
- Okay, so how many companies
make Prince Charming masks?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.724
And how many stores sell them?

09:16.757 --> 09:17.858
- We're on it.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.292
- Now what?

09:19.326 --> 09:22.663
- Now we investigate.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.733
- I can't go back
to my apartment.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.636
- Right, but CSU will be down
there in a couple of hours--

09:28.669 --> 09:31.004
- No, I mean, ever.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.073
Um, I read online
that sometimes

09:33.106 --> 09:36.309
rape victims are
given housing vouchers...

09:36.343 --> 09:39.312
- Yes, Sacred Haven, yeah.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.782
I can talk to my boss,
but in the mean--

09:41.815 --> 09:43.283
- I can't go back.
[crying]

09:43.316 --> 09:45.085
Please, please don't make me.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.955
- Hey, hey...

09:47.988 --> 09:49.857
Hey...

09:50.791 --> 09:52.292
- Liv,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.662
there's six Halloween stores
within a ten-mile radius

09:54.695 --> 09:56.129
of Savannah's apartment.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.198
Over 5,000 of those
costumes have been sold.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.969
- Yeah, and that's
just the brick and mortar.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.205
- Okay, so take a picture
of this mask

10:05.238 --> 10:08.008
to Savannah's building.
See if any of the neighbors

10:08.041 --> 10:10.243
saw him lurking around
before he broke in.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.747
*

10:13.781 --> 10:14.882
- Savannah said
the perp entered

10:14.915 --> 10:16.383
through her bedroom window.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.686
She fixed her lock.
That was a teachable moment.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.988
- She's behind
on all of her bills.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.990
Most of these credit card
statements are final notices.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.858
- That's what
your 20's are for,

10:24.892 --> 10:26.293
racking up credit debt.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.828
- Not me, I never paid a bill
late in my life.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.229
Not even then.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.964
- What? You couldn't handle
all the Hail Marys?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.399
- God nothing to do with it.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.367
I wanted to finance a Mustang.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.004
Bad credit, I would have been
dead in the water.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.107
- This is where he was hiding.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.775
- Hey, Fin,
come check this out.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.076
[radio chatter]

10:43.110 --> 10:44.945
She chronicles
her every move.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.315
- She has over
2,000 Facebook friends.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.351
Maybe one of them
considers himself Charming.

10:51.384 --> 10:55.789
- This photo was taken Tuesday
the 12th at 11:00 pm.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.692
Savannah told us the rape
happened at 9:00 pm.

10:58.726 --> 10:59.993
So she goes out drinking
with her friends

11:00.027 --> 11:01.862
two hours
after she was raped?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.230
- I know that guy's T-shirt.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.965
It's from a company called
"Pick-Up Kings."

11:04.998 --> 11:06.399
It's where tools teach
other tools

11:06.433 --> 11:09.269
how to bed a different
chick every night of the week.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.871
- So, the number on
the shirt...?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.439
- Those are notches
in his belt.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.841
[mouse click]

11:13.874 --> 11:16.343
- Nick Collins.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.811
- 160, huh?

11:17.845 --> 11:18.912
Must've had a good week.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.180
- I don't brag.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.082
- Yeah? What do you call
that then?

11:22.115 --> 11:24.151
- A sales tool. Would you pay
someone to teach you

11:24.184 --> 11:25.418
how to spice up your sex life
who could count...

11:25.452 --> 11:26.920
- Do not say conquests.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.723
- ...his successful dates
on one hand?

11:29.757 --> 11:30.758
- What's your secret?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.259
- That'll cost you.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.027
- Okay, you want to call
Consumer Fraud or should I?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.863
- Fine.
Look at me.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.464
What do you see?

11:37.497 --> 11:39.833
A little bit of Brad Pitt's
younger brother, right?

11:39.867 --> 11:41.368
Around the eyes.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.771
- Yeah, if I had one too many
and the lights were out.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.372
- Bottom line, it works.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.275
- So, did you use that Brad
Pitt bull on Savannah Ross?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.911
Or did you just go straight
to the rape?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.145
- Rape? What?

11:52.179 --> 11:54.081
- Before you met her
for drinks.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.116
- She's like my kid sister.
There's no way I'd ever...

11:56.149 --> 11:58.085
Is she okay?
- Well, I got three sisters

11:58.118 --> 12:02.455
and you never see me touching
any of them like that.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.392
- You're kidding, man,
like we never even hooked up.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.394
I'll tell you
who you should talk to.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.897
Some dude who shops at her
store's been creeping her out.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.298
She told me one time
he showed up

12:11.331 --> 12:13.400
at her apartment,
unannounced, with flowers.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.938
*

12:17.971 --> 12:19.940
- Excuse me, you the manager?
- Yeah.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.875
- I'm Detective Tutuola.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.210
This is Detective Carisi.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.846
- And we're here to talk
about Savannah Ross.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.217
- Tell me you guys caught
the bastard who raped her.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.953
- Whoa, whoa.
She told you she was raped?

12:32.986 --> 12:36.189
- She showed up late,
second time this month.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.926
So, I fired her.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.393
Millennials.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.562
They'll walk all over you if
you let them, you know.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.097
So...well...

12:44.131 --> 12:45.966
She burst into tears,
she told me the reason

12:45.999 --> 12:48.368
she was late was
because she was raped.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.838
That's why I took her
to the cops myself.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.505
- Hold on, let me get
this straight.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.876
She already reported the rape
to the police?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.410
- Isn't that what I just said?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.347
I took her right to the 21st
Precinct around the corner.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.316
- Somehow she managed
to forgot to tell us that.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.118
[tense music]

13:05.152 --> 13:06.987
- Yeah, from the grocery
store, her boss brought her in.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.521
- Yeah, you're supposed
to call us.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.390
- I would have if she hadn't
made the whole thing up.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.225
I did you guys a favor.

13:12.259 --> 13:15.195
- Okay, a favor would have been
letting us interview her,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.530
do a rape kit
before two week passed.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.933
- She always this pleasant?
- Hey, you want to find out?

13:19.967 --> 13:22.535
- Why don't you just tell us
what happened?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.437
- Look, a girl comes in,
hungover.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.039
The whole time she's telling me

13:26.073 --> 13:27.407
what went down she's looking
back at her boss,

13:27.440 --> 13:30.377
like she's checking to see
if he's listening.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.045
- Yes, that's normal.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.480
Because she'd just
went through

13:33.513 --> 13:36.216
the most traumatic
experience of her life.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.251
She doesn't need an audience.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.420
- Believe me, I get it.
I have two daughters.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.222
That's why I told her boss
to head back to the store

13:42.255 --> 13:43.556
said I'd take it from there.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.025
- What did she say?

13:45.058 --> 13:46.359
- I had her go
over the details again.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.161
Suddenly it's maybe
this happened.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.562
Maybe he did this.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.398
I pushed a little, like we do,

13:51.431 --> 13:52.900
and that's when she said,

13:52.933 --> 13:54.567
"maybe I dreamed
the whole thing."

13:54.601 --> 13:55.602
- You're kidding.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.037
- Her exact words.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.238
I heard a lot of stories
on the job,

13:58.271 --> 13:59.940
but that was
definitely a first.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.176
- 'Cause maybe you pushed
too hard.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.913
And maybe that's why you're
supposed to call us.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.380
- I repeated my question,

14:07.414 --> 14:09.116
"Were you raped or not?"

14:09.149 --> 14:11.318
You know what she said?

14:11.351 --> 14:14.955
She says, "I don't know what
I'll do if I lose this job."

14:14.988 --> 14:17.390
[dramatic music]

14:23.463 --> 14:23.596
.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.331
- I wasn't ready to talk
about it.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.901
Not there.
Not to that detective.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.903
But my boss said I had to
report it.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.305
- Well, he was right,
Savannah, you did.

14:32.339 --> 14:36.009
- Like he knows
what it's like.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.610
What's the difference?

14:37.644 --> 14:41.281
You'll never understand
how I felt.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.951
- So why don't you tell me?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.688
- Um...

14:48.721 --> 14:51.691
After it happened,
I didn't want to be alone.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.361
That's why I went out
drinking with my friends.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.029
And if that makes me a liar--

14:56.063 --> 14:57.597
- It doesn't.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.338
- Just feel so alone,
you know.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.141
- What about family?
What about your parents?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.379
- What about them?
Look at me.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.181
Exhibit A...

15:14.214 --> 15:16.383
All the wonders of the New York
City foster care system

15:16.416 --> 15:18.618
in all its glory.

15:18.651 --> 15:22.489
14 years, living in other
people's houses,

15:22.522 --> 15:26.059
sleeping in
other people's beds...

15:26.093 --> 15:28.395
You know what you pray
for most?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.297
[somber music]

15:30.330 --> 15:32.499
A new light bulb.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.101
It's crazy, right?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.003
But the other one kept
burning out

15:36.036 --> 15:38.138
because I was too scared
to shut it off.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.506
*

15:39.539 --> 15:41.674
- I'm so sorry.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.244
- You know what's worse
than being scared?

15:44.277 --> 15:47.347
Being pitied.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.481
Yeah.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.083
I should have told you

15:50.117 --> 15:52.119
that I already reported it
to other cops.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.720
What's the point?

15:53.753 --> 15:56.256
People like you don't believe
people like me.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.657
*

15:57.690 --> 16:01.494
- I believe you, Savannah.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.131
I believe you.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.766
*

16:06.799 --> 16:08.368
- Savannah was raped
all right,

16:08.401 --> 16:09.602
by the system.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.271
Her parents are
both drug addicts

16:11.304 --> 16:12.739
and all around dirt-bags.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.674
It took them dying
to get her out of that house.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.343
- When no living family member
wanted her,

16:16.376 --> 16:18.078
she spent eight months at ACS

16:18.111 --> 16:19.712
until they could find her
a willing foster home.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.449
- She bounced from home
to home, a total of ten.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.484
- Average foster kid
only sees five.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.752
- Yeah, still,
there's nothing about her

16:25.785 --> 16:28.055
being sexually abused
in here.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.357
- Okay, well, false rape
accusations don't come

16:30.390 --> 16:31.358
out of thin air.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.659
- Except when they do.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.327
- That's not how we work,
Amanda.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.662
- I know we don't,
but Liv, come on.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.130
- Lieutenant,
maybe there is a chance--

16:37.164 --> 16:38.398
- What?

16:38.431 --> 16:39.532
- Maybe she is stretching
the truth.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.101
- 'Cause let me count the ways.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.402
She told me that she didn't
tell anyone else

16:42.435 --> 16:43.803
that she was raped.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.405
She told her boss,
she told another detective.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.174
- Mm-hmm.
- And if omissions count,

16:47.207 --> 16:49.676
which they should, she
conveniently left out the part

16:49.709 --> 16:52.445
about going partying
after the alleged assault.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.182
And...the Prince Charming mask?

16:55.215 --> 16:58.251
She's living out some
perverted fairy tale.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.621
- Tracy Montgomery.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.390
- That's what
I'm talking about.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.691
- What?
- Who's that?

17:04.724 --> 17:06.693
- Tracy Montgomery
was a cashier

17:06.726 --> 17:08.795
who worked at a Chevron
station at a minimart.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.564
She claimed
she was raped at gunpoint

17:11.598 --> 17:13.700
by three guys
in the storage closet.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.269
- Only the cash
register receipts...

17:16.303 --> 17:19.106
showed she made six sales
during the time of that attack.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.175
- So...I could have
blown it off.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.344
And I probably should have
blown it off, but...

17:24.377 --> 17:27.514
The bottom line is the truth

17:27.547 --> 17:30.617
of what her two cousins
were doing to her

17:30.650 --> 17:32.852
from the time she was
three years old,

17:32.885 --> 17:36.223
was far worse than anything
she could have made up.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.359
Sometimes girls like Tracy,
girls like Savannah,

17:39.392 --> 17:42.295
need to make up fairy tales...

17:42.329 --> 17:44.497
just to get through the day.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.435
- Okay, we'll talk to some of
her other foster parents,

17:48.468 --> 17:50.470
see if they remember anything
that's not in the file.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.473
- Yeah.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.242
*

17:55.275 --> 17:57.610
- Yeah, I read a study
that said kids who participate

17:57.644 --> 17:59.312
in garden projects
performed better

17:59.346 --> 18:01.248
in scientific achievement
than kids who don't so...

18:01.281 --> 18:03.450
- And magically a few extra
bucks from the state

18:03.483 --> 18:04.784
appears in your pocket.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.619
- [chuckles]
You caught me.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.488
I mean look, I have five kids.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.757
And they all hate the beets,
but it's what keeps me sane.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.393
- Savannah Ross.
- Let me guess...

18:13.426 --> 18:15.628
You guys busted her
for shoplifting a pack of gum

18:15.662 --> 18:16.896
and suddenly
it's the store clerk

18:16.929 --> 18:18.365
got a little handsy
with her?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.167
- You don't trust her?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.634
- Call me jaded, but that kid
put me through the ringer.

18:21.668 --> 18:22.635
- How long was she with you?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.237
- Three years.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.306
She moved six months
before she turned 18.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.774
- Well, what happened?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.576
- Clark happened.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.144
Her foster brother.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.612
I came home early
from work one day

18:32.645 --> 18:34.214
and found them
in bed together.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.648
- She's almost 18.
- Yeah, so was Clark.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.217
I mean, they apologized

18:37.250 --> 18:39.252
from here to Walla Walla
and back again,

18:39.286 --> 18:42.189
but I still had to report it
to Pamela, the social worker.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.357
Pam thought it would be easier
to move Savannah.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.259
- Savannah didn't like that?

18:46.293 --> 18:49.462
- Look, one minute it was two
kids exploring their sexuality.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.730
The next thing you know,

18:50.763 --> 18:52.532
Savannah's crying
"forcible rape."

18:52.565 --> 18:54.767
- Is there any chance
that she was telling the truth?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.703
- There were text messages
back and forth between them

18:56.736 --> 18:58.305
about their relationship.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.273
When we confronted Savannah
about the texts,

19:00.307 --> 19:03.343
She says, "Maybe I dreamt
the whole damn thing."

19:03.376 --> 19:05.678
[chuckles]
That's what I thought too.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.814
Look, eventually Savannah
admitted it was a hoax.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.549
She just didn't want
to change schools

19:09.582 --> 19:11.618
in the middle
of her senior year.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.491
[door closes]

19:18.525 --> 19:19.826
- We're being played, Liv.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.661
- Amanda, there's
something there.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.964
- Normally, I would agree
with you, but...

19:24.997 --> 19:27.700
Savannah...

19:27.734 --> 19:29.769
Look at her history.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.438
Okay? This girl...

19:31.471 --> 19:33.840
cried rape so that she
wouldn't lose her job.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.508
She cried rape so that
she wouldn't have to leave

19:35.542 --> 19:37.310
the foster home
that she liked,

19:37.344 --> 19:39.346
and now because she can't
afford her apartment

19:39.379 --> 19:40.380
that she's living in.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.549
She played me

19:42.582 --> 19:43.983
so that she'd have
a new place to live.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.319
You're normally right
about these things,

19:46.353 --> 19:48.321
and God knows I...

19:48.355 --> 19:50.823
I trust your instincts.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.592
But with this one,

19:52.625 --> 19:54.461
this time I think...

19:54.494 --> 19:56.863
- Hey, Lieutenant, we caught
a rape on the Upper West Side.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.866
- Okay, uh, take Fin.
You and Fin.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.538
- I think maybe...

20:05.572 --> 20:08.007
- Maybe what, Amanda?
Just say it.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.442
- I just...

20:09.476 --> 20:11.444
Maybe...

20:13.580 --> 20:16.949
Maybe your eyes aren't as clear
as they usually are.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.421
I think with everything going
on with Noah...

20:21.454 --> 20:22.922
I think...

20:22.955 --> 20:25.525
You're seeing yourself...

20:26.393 --> 20:28.528
As a little bit of a victim
right now, and it's making you

20:28.561 --> 20:31.331
more likely to see Savannah
that way as well.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.334
[tense music]

20:34.367 --> 20:39.806
*

20:39.839 --> 20:41.541
- So you can't stay here.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.975
- Believe me,
I'm not surprised.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.312
- I want to believe you,
Savannah.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.013
- But I just have
one of those faces.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.748
- No.

20:48.781 --> 20:51.684
I was actually going to say...

20:51.718 --> 20:53.986
that your story
doesn't quite add up.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.323
- Well, gave it a shot, right?

20:58.325 --> 21:00.993
- You know, I know
that you had it rough.

21:01.027 --> 21:05.298
Couldn't have been easy
growing up in foster homes.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.301
But a lot of kids grow up
in foster care.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.803
And a lot of kids
have crappy lives.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
- And a lot of them grow up
to run for Congress

21:13.340 --> 21:15.408
or win Nobel Prizes
in physics--

21:15.442 --> 21:19.712
- Exactly, because they stopped
seeing themselves as victims,

21:19.746 --> 21:22.982
so they stop being victims.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.786
Savannah, your life
is far from over.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.822
- So I have to move back
to my apartment.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.991
Is that it?

21:32.024 --> 21:33.493
- You do.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.329
*

21:36.363 --> 21:38.698
I'm sorry.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.067
- Not that it matters...

21:42.869 --> 21:44.837
But I was telling the truth.

21:44.871 --> 21:51.544
*

21:53.112 --> 21:55.715
- Mom always returns my calls.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.016
When she missed
her doctor's appointment,

21:57.049 --> 21:59.652
I knew something was wrong.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.788
I found her curled up
in bed in a ball.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.056
- When did this happen?
- Two nights ago.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.526
- Mrs. Burns, is there a reason
that you didn't call us?

22:06.559 --> 22:08.628
- He took photos of me.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.898
He said if I told anyone
he'd put them on the internet.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.700
I didn't want
my grandchildren--

22:13.733 --> 22:16.369
- Mom, it's okay.

22:16.403 --> 22:19.639
- Mrs. Burns, what can you tell
us about the man who raped you?

22:19.672 --> 22:21.808
- I didn't see his face.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.843
He wore a mask.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.879
He said he was
my Prince Charming.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.817
[tense music]

22:30.850 --> 22:33.085
[gasps]

22:33.119 --> 22:34.621
That's it.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.423
Oh, my God.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.459
- You're saying he did this
before?

22:39.492 --> 22:41.394
- Looks like.

22:45.965 --> 22:46.499
.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.133
- Take your time, Mrs. Burns.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.838
- He was hiding in my closet
when I came home.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.174
He played Wagner,
the "Liebestod"

22:55.207 --> 22:58.010
from "Tristan and Is--Is--"

22:58.044 --> 22:59.879
- The German opera?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.080
- Yes.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.049
He brought it
with him.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.618
He said he wanted
to set the mood.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.555
- Tell them what the sick
bastard did before he left.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.925
- [whimpering]

23:12.959 --> 23:16.496
He cleaned the filter
on my air conditioner.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.532
He said that I could close
my windows at night.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.868
He didn't want anyone
to break in and hurt me.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.871
Then I had to shower
for 20 minutes.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.138
Exactly.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.440
He timed it.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.508
[wheezing]

23:28.541 --> 23:31.778
- Look here, Mom.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.551
- [breathing slowly]

23:38.585 --> 23:41.688
Then he made me
brush my teeth

23:41.721 --> 23:43.490
and gargle with mouthwash.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.725
- He's trying to get rid
of any traces of DNA.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.494
- And that's why
he wore gloves.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.028
- What about the bedding?

23:49.061 --> 23:50.162
- He took it all.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.698
And the towels too.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.066
- Did you use your inhaler
when he was here?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.936
*

23:56.969 --> 23:59.205
- [crying]
When he was kissing me...

23:59.238 --> 24:01.808
I started to wheeze, and...

24:01.841 --> 24:05.712
I thought he'd get mad,
but he was nice.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.214
He handed me my inhaler.
[sniffles]

24:08.247 --> 24:10.850
And waited until
I caught my breath.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.085
- Mom, he is a disgusting
animal who raped you.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.821
He is not nice.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.857
That psycho stole my mother's
diamond tennis bracelet.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.759
It was a gift from my father
before he died.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.694
- Do you have a photo
of that bracelet?

24:21.728 --> 24:23.596
- That one right there.

24:25.264 --> 24:27.233
- Was that the same inhaler
you used?

24:27.266 --> 24:28.668
- Yes.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.837
- But he--he wore gloves...

24:30.870 --> 24:33.840
- Yeah, but he kissed her
before she used the inhaler.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.509
Maybe some of his saliva
transferred from her lips

24:36.543 --> 24:38.477
back on to it.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.713
- Any luck?

24:40.747 --> 24:42.915
- I knocked on Savannah's door.
No answer.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.017
- Okay, I left a bunch
of messages for her.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.687
So...she'll get back to us.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.091
- Is this where
I get the lecture?

24:52.124 --> 24:54.093
- No.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.728
It was my decision.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.630
- But I pushed you.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.732
I was pretty relentless.
I was closed-minded.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.868
- Hey, we got a DNA hit
on the inhaler.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.069
It matches a hair
that was found

25:03.102 --> 25:04.571
at the scene of a burglary

25:04.604 --> 25:05.605
that happened in Brooklyn
last year.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.273
- No rape?
- Right.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.241
- Well it wouldn't be the first
time a perp changed lanes.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.677
- The vic's name is Anne Speer.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.879
- Okay, go talk to her.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.785
*

25:18.818 --> 25:21.888
- My coworker, Matt, and I
had to pull an all-nighter.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.556
Instead of staying
at the office,

25:23.590 --> 25:26.192
I invited him back
to my place.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.894
Thank God I did.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.029
Matt went straight
to the couch to set up.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.565
I went into my bedroom
to change into sweats.

25:32.599 --> 25:36.636
The guy must have hid in my
closet when heard me come in.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.037
He grabbed me from behind.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.907
I screamed.
Matt came rushing in.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.575
He--they fought.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.043
He picked up scissors
from the nightstand,

25:44.076 --> 25:45.778
stabbed him in the leg.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.814
- Savannah said he had
a bad scar on his left leg.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.816
- Why is this coming up now?

25:49.849 --> 25:52.685
- We think this guy might've
attacked two women after you.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.253
- Attack? What kind of attack?

25:54.286 --> 25:56.923
- Did you happen
to see his face?

25:56.956 --> 25:58.257
- He wore a mask.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.759
A black ski mask.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.695
I told the regular cops
all this.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.597
Did he rape them?

26:04.631 --> 26:06.165
- You told them
it was a burglary.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.000
- Well, there was a rash of
burglaries in the neighborhood.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.802
I just assumed...

26:09.836 --> 26:12.171
- Okay, is there anything else
you remember about this guy?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.943
- It's crazy, but...

26:16.976 --> 26:18.978
a week before,
I signed this petition

26:19.011 --> 26:21.648
to "protect my reproductive
rights" outside of the bodega

26:21.681 --> 26:23.683
down the street.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.285
A few days later,
I was at the bodega.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.889
The canvasser,
he remembered me by name.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.091
- You think this was the same
guy in your apartment?

26:32.124 --> 26:33.225
- I have no idea,

26:33.259 --> 26:36.162
but the strange thing...

26:36.195 --> 26:38.597
he was on crutches.

26:39.766 --> 26:43.135
- Savannah, please
open the door, please.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.406
Let me make this right.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.808
- People don't believe me.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.009
I just have one of those faces.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.779
- No, that's absolutely
not true.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.714
- You didn't believe me.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.015
- Because I made a mistake.

26:56.048 --> 26:59.886
And that is 100% my fault,
and I'm sorry.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.256
- I can get you something.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.959
I don't have coffee.

27:06.993 --> 27:10.730
But I've got a box of cronuts.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.298
It's not a croissant.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.266
It's not a doughnut.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.136
It doesn't know what it is.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.672
Kind of like me.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.711
- You are an incredibly strong
woman who was traumatized

27:24.744 --> 27:27.279
by no fault of your own.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.249
- Then whose fault was it?

27:30.282 --> 27:32.384
My dad?

27:32.418 --> 27:36.422
He was shanked in his cell
in Attica when I was two.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.991
Mom?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.060
She overdosed on crack
on the kitchen floor

27:41.093 --> 27:42.061
when I was four.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.830
- And I'm sorry.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.898
[somber music]

27:45.932 --> 27:48.167
I can't make any promises.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.070
But I can tell you
that every single day...

27:51.103 --> 27:53.139
we're getting closer
to the man who did this to you.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.474
- [scoffs]
You don't have to lie.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.210
- I would never do that.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.180
*

28:01.213 --> 28:04.150
The man who did this to you,
we think...

28:04.183 --> 28:08.487
you may have signed
a petition of his.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.757
- Sure.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.792
I'm the jerk who does that.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.161
- Have you signed one recently?

28:15.194 --> 28:18.064
- I mean, there's always guys
outside of my gym.

28:18.097 --> 28:21.100
Something about banning
puppy mills.

28:21.133 --> 28:24.804
- I signed a petition
for art in inner city schools.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.206
I'm a retired teacher.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.408
- Where was that?

28:29.441 --> 28:31.811
- Outside my bank.

28:31.844 --> 28:35.047
The Friday
before I was attacked.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.817
I had a hair appointment.
I was late.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.185
Still, I enjoyed talking
to him.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.319
He loved opera.

28:40.352 --> 28:46.492
*

28:46.525 --> 28:48.260
Oh, my God.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.929
[sobbing]

28:49.962 --> 28:52.731
- Do you remember
what he looked like?

28:54.100 --> 28:57.036
- You never really look
at their faces.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.372
- These canvassing companies
are all over the city.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.908
Greenpeace, Solar Energy,

29:01.941 --> 29:03.242
Community Outreach,
you name it.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.543
- Guys, come on.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.978
We have a serial rapist
out there.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.780
You've got to narrow it down.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.381
- And maybe we have, because
there's only three companies

29:09.415 --> 29:11.884
with offices both in Manhattan
and Brooklyn.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.519
- McMillian Enterprises,

29:13.552 --> 29:16.155
Causey & Smith,
and the Cooper-Price Group.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.157
- Yeah, but the Cooper-Price
Group is the only one

29:18.190 --> 29:20.359
with open petitions
for female reproductive rights,

29:20.392 --> 29:24.030
arts in the inner city,
and anti-puppy mills.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.298
- Go.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.834
[sighs]

29:27.867 --> 29:29.201
- Hey, uh...

29:29.235 --> 29:31.137
Liv, this might be
out of line--

29:31.170 --> 29:32.972
- Yeah, second apologies
usually are.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.307
- You and Cassidy...

29:35.341 --> 29:37.176
- Yeah, what about him?

29:38.210 --> 29:42.982
- I thought--look, you guys
ended pretty amicably?

29:43.015 --> 29:44.250
- Yeah, it still is.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.852
I mean--ended, I mean.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.887
- But maybe not that amicably?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.521
- Amanda, what are you
talking about?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.257
- Let me explain what the hell
I'm talking about.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.092
The other night I was having
drinks with--

29:53.125 --> 29:54.861
with Mike Lasky--
- From the Two-Seven.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.162
- Yes, except now
he's an investigator

29:56.195 --> 29:58.030
at the DA's office,
and it turns out

29:58.064 --> 30:00.132
it's the same division
that's investigating you.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.101
- Okay.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.502
If you want to pull strings,
I'm not interested,

30:03.535 --> 30:04.904
but thank you very much.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.439
- No, no.
No, Mike's...

30:07.473 --> 30:08.975
not like that, I asked.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.210
Anyway, after his fourth
Jameson, he tells me

30:11.243 --> 30:13.279
that there never would have
been an investigation

30:13.312 --> 30:16.215
if it weren't
for Brian Cassidy.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.617
- What?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.887
- I mean, that's all he'd say.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.256
[dramatic music]

30:29.628 --> 30:29.996
.

30:30.029 --> 30:30.196
- Hey.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.065
- Hey.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.633
What the hell, Brian?

30:34.666 --> 30:37.036
If you want to mess with me,
that's one thing, but my kid?

30:37.069 --> 30:38.270
That's another story.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.371
- Noah?
What are you talking about?

30:39.405 --> 30:41.040
- What am I talking about?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.408
You're gonna pretend
that you didn't talk

30:42.441 --> 30:45.011
to Michelle whatever
from the DA's office?

30:45.044 --> 30:46.545
- I-I work with her.
- Yeah.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.415
- I talk to her every day--
- Yeah. About me.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.517
- Would you slow down
for a second here?

30:51.550 --> 30:52.919
All right?

30:52.952 --> 30:55.254
Look, I...

30:55.287 --> 30:57.023
We went and had drinks
after work, all right?

30:57.056 --> 30:59.425
She was talking about how
tough it is having kids,

30:59.458 --> 31:01.227
being on the job--
your name came up.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.528
- And William Lewis?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.630
Did his name just happen
to come up too?

31:04.663 --> 31:08.234
About the fact that I was
kidnapped and assaulted?

31:08.267 --> 31:10.402
And that makes me
a crappy mother, Brian?

31:10.436 --> 31:13.005
- No, no, not at all.
I...

31:13.039 --> 31:14.406
I told her how strong you were,

31:14.440 --> 31:16.108
how--how you bounced back
after what happened.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.176
How totally devoted
to your job--

31:17.209 --> 31:19.011
- And how I needed a shrink!

31:19.045 --> 31:20.679
- It's not like you ever wanted
to talk to me about it.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.381
- Oh, my God.
- No, wait--just stop, stop.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.150
Hey, come here, stop--
hey, stop it.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.552
Relax.
I'm sorry, okay?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.420
I'm sorry.

31:28.454 --> 31:32.091
Look, Liv, I told her how
you're the last person

31:32.124 --> 31:34.460
that should ever be
under investigation, okay?

31:34.493 --> 31:36.295
I told her what
a great mom you are.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.031
- And how I almost killed
William Lewis?

31:39.065 --> 31:42.034
[tense music]

31:42.068 --> 31:44.070
*

31:44.103 --> 31:46.238
Next time, Brian...

31:47.639 --> 31:49.608
Don't help me.

31:49.641 --> 31:54.280
*

31:54.313 --> 31:55.614
- Damn it.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.619
- We have over 30 canvassers
working at any given time.

32:00.652 --> 32:02.588
They move all over the city.
I couldn't say.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.423
- Did any of your canvassers
recently move

32:04.456 --> 32:06.258
from the Brooklyn office
to this one?

32:06.292 --> 32:08.194
- We get about five
new recruits a month.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.196
- Who's this guy?

32:10.229 --> 32:12.031
- Tom Williams.
One of ours.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.633
Monica's entering
his signatures from last month.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.439
- Same dude?

32:20.472 --> 32:22.208
- Where is he?
Where's Tom right now?

32:22.241 --> 32:24.343
- He worked the early shift.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.511
Should have just left his post.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.745
- When does he come here?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.347
- End of the month.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.549
That's when our guys
turn in their signatures.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.185
- Okay, we're gonna need
his home address.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.221
*

32:35.254 --> 32:37.256
[pounding on door]

32:38.690 --> 32:40.392
- Oh, yes?

32:40.426 --> 32:42.061
- Sorry, we're looking
for Tom Williams.

32:42.094 --> 32:43.562
- Tommy is my son.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.764
- Oh, he is.
So--so he lives here, does he?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.466
- Well, this is his home.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.101
Where else would he live?

32:49.135 --> 32:51.137
- Can we come in
and talk to Tommy?

32:51.170 --> 32:52.638
- You could if he were here,

32:52.671 --> 32:54.606
but I don't think he'll be long

32:54.640 --> 32:56.142
if you care to come
in and wait.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.743
- Thank you.

33:01.213 --> 33:04.650
- I was just about to have some
tea, if you'd care to join me?

33:04.683 --> 33:06.118
- No, we're good.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.353
- Or I could always top it off

33:07.386 --> 33:09.388
with a little brandy,
if you prefer?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.357
- We have to turn that down
too, Mrs. Williams.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.293
To tell you the truth,
we're police.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.661
- Well... [chuckles]

33:15.694 --> 33:17.396
I never imagined that Tommy
would socialize

33:17.429 --> 33:19.065
with civil servants.

33:19.098 --> 33:22.534
Although I--I do appreciate
everything that you do.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.503
- And we appreciate that.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.105
Can I use
the little boys' room?

33:26.138 --> 33:28.140
- Oh, yes, of course.
It's right down the hall

33:28.174 --> 33:29.308
just past Tommy's bedroom.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.542
- Thank you.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.511
[door opens]

33:32.544 --> 33:33.812
- Where is Tommy off to?

33:33.845 --> 33:37.049
- He didn't say,
probably a singing lesson.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.319
Do not say no.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.624
- You know, I always wished
I had learned how to sing.

33:45.657 --> 33:46.758
- He teaches.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.395
He sang at the Met
as a child, though...

33:49.428 --> 33:52.464
the maestro was very jealous.

33:52.498 --> 33:56.702
Tommy could have become
a brilliant heldentenor.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.705
[groans]
Would you stop?

33:59.738 --> 34:02.241
You're getting crumbs
everywhere.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.709
[suspenseful music]

34:03.742 --> 34:05.144
[sighs]

34:05.177 --> 34:08.147
*

34:08.180 --> 34:10.316
Oh, yes.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.252
It's lovely, isn't it?

34:13.285 --> 34:14.620
Tommy gave it to me.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.488
- Gave it to you, huh?

34:16.522 --> 34:18.390
A couple of days ago, right?

34:18.424 --> 34:20.726
- He's such a good boy.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.529
*

34:23.562 --> 34:25.097
- I got a souvenir.

34:25.131 --> 34:26.265
- I got a box of 'em.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.633
And a list of signatures.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.302
Guess what names have stars
next to 'em.

34:30.336 --> 34:33.572
- Savannah Ross, Nancy Burns.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.174
- Yeah, and one more.

34:35.207 --> 34:36.208
Signed last week.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.276
- Excuse me.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.710
You can't touch that.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.746
- Ma'am, this is a warrant.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.681
It says I can touch whatever
the hell I want...

34:42.714 --> 34:45.251
including that bracelet.
Take it off, please.

34:45.284 --> 34:49.355
*

34:49.388 --> 34:50.822
Her name is Vivian Stevens.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.325
She's starred just like
the other two vics.

34:53.359 --> 34:56.862
Her address is 113 Chittenden
Avenue, Apartment 2B.

34:56.895 --> 35:00.166
All right,
we'll meet you there.

35:00.199 --> 35:03.369
- No, I'm so sorry, I didn't
mean to--no, please,

35:03.402 --> 35:07.306
don't please, don't kill--
I didn't mean it.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.707
Please.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.242
- NYPD!

35:10.276 --> 35:12.378
*

35:12.411 --> 35:13.779
- [grunts]

35:13.812 --> 35:17.349
- Please, don't!
Please, please!

35:17.383 --> 35:19.285
[crying]
Please, help me.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.786
Please, help me!
[screaming]

35:20.819 --> 35:22.221
- Tom.

35:22.254 --> 35:24.223
Tom, put the gun down now.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.524
- Please, help me, please--

35:25.557 --> 35:27.193
- Put the gun down.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.560
- Please.
[sobbing]

35:33.299 --> 35:33.465
.

35:33.499 --> 35:33.765
- [crying]

35:34.766 --> 35:36.735
[dramatic music]

35:36.768 --> 35:38.637
- Put the gun down.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.306
*

35:40.339 --> 35:42.174
- [sobbing]

35:42.208 --> 35:43.875
[screaming]
- Go, go!

35:43.909 --> 35:47.179
You're okay.
You're okay, all right?

35:47.213 --> 35:51.850
SUV CO to Central. I got
a 10-85 at 113 Chittenden.

35:51.883 --> 35:54.320
You're okay. Take a breath.

35:54.353 --> 36:01.360
*

36:11.437 --> 36:12.871
- [panting]

36:12.904 --> 36:17.343
*

36:17.376 --> 36:18.744
- Tommy, stop.

36:18.777 --> 36:25.951
*

36:27.386 --> 36:29.621
Hey, Tom, you're not going
anywhere.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.458
'Cause we've got the building
surrounded.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.892
You can't get away.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.694
- Then I might as well shoot.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.563
- That wouldn't be smart.

36:37.596 --> 36:40.499
*

36:40.532 --> 36:42.901
[breathing heavily]

36:42.934 --> 36:46.605
All right.
Look, we can just--

36:46.638 --> 36:48.540
we can take a breath, okay?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.814
I knew you'd never hurt me.
- You don't know anything.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.783
- No, I know you don't
hurt women.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.486
It's not how you were raised.

37:00.519 --> 37:04.490
You're one of the good ones,
you're a gentleman.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.593
You know, Nancy, Savannah,
you were good to them.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.828
Right? You--you fixed
Nancy's air conditioner.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.664
You told Savannah
about the broken window.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.667
Right? The guys I date...

37:15.701 --> 37:17.336
Man, I...

37:17.369 --> 37:18.904
I'm lucky if I can get them
to close the door

37:18.937 --> 37:20.672
on their way out,
you know what I mean?

37:20.706 --> 37:23.975
'Cause once they get what they
came for, what do they care?

37:25.644 --> 37:29.014
You know who I blame?
I blame their moms.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.550
But you're not
like that, Tom.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.552
You do care.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.355
You want to keep us safe.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.391
You're Prince Charming, right?

37:39.425 --> 37:42.428
- Don't come any closer.
- Okay.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.464
- I'm good to them because
they're good girls.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.836
- Can you just
drop the gun, Tom?

37:50.869 --> 37:52.704
Go ahead.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.005
I mean, think about it.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.041
What would your mom say
if she saw--

37:56.074 --> 37:57.576
Tom!

37:57.609 --> 37:58.977
- [yells]

37:59.010 --> 38:05.784

38:05.817 --> 38:08.053
- Okay, he's headed south
down the fire escape.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.421
He's headed
toward the back alley.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.789
[sirens wailing]

38:10.822 --> 38:12.924
- There, there. There, there,
there, right there.

Oh, God.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.624
- Hold on, Tom.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.692
Hang on!

38:46.725 --> 38:48.660
Give me your other hand.

Killer, huh?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.475
- Mmm, amazing.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.044
- You didn't have to do this.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.379
- No, I didn't, I wanted to.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.416
You know, Lieutenant Benson
twisted some arms

39:44.450 --> 39:46.051
and the city's gonna pay
your rent for a few months

39:46.084 --> 39:48.820
while you find a new place.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.556
- Tell her thanks.

I kind of thought she hated me.

- You know, it's...

39:55.126 --> 39:57.128
It's this job, you know.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.431
The truth is...

39:59.465 --> 40:02.468
It's me that owes you
an apology.

40:04.135 --> 40:07.072
Look, sometimes...

40:08.006 --> 40:10.742
I forget to believe in people.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.779
And I had a family.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.114
- So I shouldn't be jealous?

40:16.147 --> 40:18.650
- God, no.
- [chuckles]

40:18.684 --> 40:21.453
- Just don't hog the ketchup,
huh?

40:33.632 --> 40:36.468
- [laughs]
Mommy, he's so silly.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.236
- [chuckles]
He certainly is.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.706
[cell phone buzzes]

40:45.744 --> 40:47.813
- Work?

40:47.846 --> 40:49.214
- Um...

40:49.247 --> 40:50.882
[cell phone buzzing]

40:50.916 --> 40:53.084
You know what?

40:53.118 --> 40:55.654
If it's important,
they'll call back.

40:57.022 --> 40:59.991
[soft music]
