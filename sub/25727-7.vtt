WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:03.252
Hey, everybody. I'm live-streaming today

00:03.253 --> 00:04.837
to inform you of an injustice

00:04.838 --> 00:06.881
that is occurring at Scooter Taco.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.257
<i>Because evil will triumph</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:10.343
<i>if good women like myself do nothing.</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:14.513
<i>I'm here to do nothing.</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:16.349
<i>So as you can see here,</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:19.644
<i>I have a coupon that
is good for one Scooterito</i>

00:19.645 --> 00:21.979
<i>with the purchase of a Scooter Meal.</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:24.273
<i>Wait, why is my hair doing that?</i>

00:24.274 --> 00:26.024
Dude, I thought we were gonna eat.

00:26.035 --> 00:28.402
Why are you trying to make a
three-minute Vice documentary?

00:28.403 --> 00:29.987
<i>Now I am being told</i>

00:29.988 --> 00:31.822
<i>that, despite this coupon being present,</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:33.783
<i>it's invalid because they're "all out"!</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:38.454
<i>Ma'am can I offer you Scooter
nuggets or a Scooter salad?</i>

00:38.455 --> 00:41.437
A fast food salad?
Are you trying to kill me?

00:41.448 --> 00:42.562
I realize

00:42.573 --> 00:44.168
we're in a contentious
situation here, sir,

00:44.169 --> 00:45.920
but when it comes time for it,

00:45.921 --> 00:47.380
can I get an extra Scooter Sauce

00:47.381 --> 00:49.090
and the medium, not the scorcho?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.383
<i>Uh, there's people behind you.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:51.509
<i>Can you pull up to the side?</i>

00:51.510 --> 00:52.927
No! I won't pull to the side!

00:52.928 --> 00:55.054
Because this car is my leverage.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.390
<i>I will be powering off my vehicle...</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:59.558
and holding the keys in my hand.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.352
- Move it!
<i>- If you don't pull forward,</i>

01:01.353 --> 01:03.071
<i>we're gonna have to call
the authorities.</i>

01:03.082 --> 01:04.641
<i>Well, you'll have to call
an ambulance, too,</i>

01:04.652 --> 01:06.235
<i>because I'm about to swallow this key.</i>

01:06.246 --> 01:07.733
<i>Benji, swallow the key.</i>

01:07.734 --> 01:09.278
I'm not swallowing the key!

01:09.289 --> 01:10.852
Even if I swallow it,
the car can still start.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.238
It's a wireless key system.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.324
<i>Ma'am, what do you even want?</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:18.077
That's right, a $20 gift certificate

01:18.078 --> 01:20.079
for one small, tiny temper tantrum

01:20.080 --> 01:21.540
that also got live-streamed.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.959
They gave me scorcho instead of medium.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.752
My sphincter's gonna be on <i>fuego!</i>

01:26.753 --> 01:29.255
This will not stand!

01:29.256 --> 01:30.631
Just come on, man.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.466
This isn't a social progress situation.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.635
Benji, this is bigger
than the two of us.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.846
Esther!

01:40.485 --> 01:43.019
<i>I'm pretty sure I got hit
on by a goth chick yesterday.</i>

01:43.020 --> 01:44.603
She handed me a flyer,

01:44.604 --> 01:47.356
and she had dead eyes like me,
but it was sort of hot.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.774
It made me think maybe I should go goth.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.359
- Benji.
- I'm goth on the inside.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.320
I like sad music,
I'm obsessed with death.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.946
I just don't fit in with them

01:53.947 --> 01:57.491
because I treat my depression
with exercise, prison-style,

01:57.492 --> 01:59.285
and they treat it with black make-up.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.580
Which is why I need you to please
go to this concert with me.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.540
- That's a hard no.
- Why don't you dress like Wednesday Addams?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.624
It'll be fun.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.627
Oh, come on! Every guys wants me
to dress as Wednesday Addams!

02:08.627 --> 02:10.170
What is with you people?

02:10.172 --> 02:12.028
I just want you to fit in
at the goth concert!

02:12.039 --> 02:14.342
I don't want to be goth. We had
a pep assembly in eighth grade

02:14.343 --> 02:15.801
about the dangers of Marilyn Manson,

02:15.802 --> 02:17.928
and I really listened hard
and I believed!

02:21.475 --> 02:22.850
Hi, Esther!

02:22.851 --> 02:24.685
Mommy!

02:24.686 --> 02:26.145
Hi, sweetie!

02:26.146 --> 02:28.314
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

02:28.315 --> 02:30.149
What are you doing here?

02:30.150 --> 02:34.320
Oh. Can't a mother surprise
her daughter with a visit?

02:34.321 --> 02:36.530
Hi! Oh!

02:36.531 --> 02:38.616
You must be Benjamin.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.465
It's so nice to meet you in person.

02:41.476 --> 02:43.603
I saw on Facebook the other
day that you liked Kroger.

02:43.614 --> 02:45.247
That's a solid supermarket.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.042
So is there a place for me to unpack,

02:48.043 --> 02:51.003
or do I just pick a corner
and dump out my suitcase?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.255
Um, well, my bathtub is open,

02:53.256 --> 02:55.174
except for on Wednesday mornings.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.511
Oh, my God, this is gonna be great.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.597
Your mom flew across the
country just to surprise you.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.932
That's so sweet.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.350
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be great.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.477
She's just gonna feed me
and do my laundry

03:06.478 --> 03:08.604
and buy me stuff. Watch.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.564
Mommy, I'm hungie,

03:10.565 --> 03:13.526
and, also, all my laundry is dirty.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.570
Oh, is my little girl hungry?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.823
Here's something to chew on.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.991
Learn to cook!

03:20.992 --> 03:22.743
Stop! Mom, that's my home office!

03:22.744 --> 03:24.203
I don't care!

03:24.204 --> 03:27.456
I saw that meltdown you had on Instagram

03:27.457 --> 03:29.125
at the taco restaurant!

03:29.126 --> 03:31.669
My karate sensei saw you!

03:31.670 --> 03:34.839
Wow, your karate sensei
follows her on Instagram?

03:34.840 --> 03:37.383
Sensei MacDougal is very devoted.

03:37.384 --> 03:41.011
Mom, that video was showing the
world that justice can be served,

03:41.012 --> 03:42.930
and it got 152 likes.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.056
And you're proud of this?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.433
Do you know who you remind me of?

03:45.434 --> 03:47.351
That girl on Dr. Phil that says,

03:47.352 --> 03:49.562
"Cash me ou'side. How 'bou dah."

03:49.563 --> 03:51.564
Okay, firstly, her name is Bhad Bhabie,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.983
and she's awesome. She's a
platinum-selling recording artist.

03:53.984 --> 03:57.361
And, secondly, that was a
really good impression, Mommy.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.947
I thought she was the snottiest
thing I have ever seen.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.657
And do you know what Dr. Phil said?

04:01.658 --> 04:05.494
He said it was the mom's fault.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.873
So all of this is my fault!

04:08.874 --> 04:10.958
I have coddled you, girl!

04:10.959 --> 04:13.378
No, no, it's Dad's fault.
It's Dad's fault!

04:14.754 --> 04:16.213
No, Mom! That's my tax stuff!

04:16.214 --> 04:17.339
I don't care!

04:17.339 --> 04:19.426
I'll never file for 2014.

04:24.848 --> 04:25.890
Napping?

04:25.891 --> 04:27.808
You slept 12 hours.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.143
You're worse than a cat.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.353
At least cats eat spiders.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.482
I thought you were going to wash
the floors while I was out.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.484
Well, I thought maybe,
for old times' sake,

04:36.485 --> 04:37.735
you'd want me to fall asleep

04:37.736 --> 04:39.349
and then you just do all the cleaning.

04:39.367 --> 04:40.396
I don't even care.

04:40.407 --> 04:43.282
I bought you some nice dresses
to extend your wardrobe.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.783
Ugh! I don't want to wear dresses!

04:44.794 --> 04:48.329
Then people are gonna look at me and
think I'm trying, and it'll be sad.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.997
I don't care. I want you to wear it.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.499
We're going out for dinner tonight.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.875
I ran into Peggy Kinney,

04:52.876 --> 04:55.002
and her daughter, Stephie Kinney,

04:55.003 --> 04:57.922
lives here and is very successful in PR.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.299
And she said that she would help you

05:00.300 --> 05:02.593
to "manage your brand."

05:02.594 --> 05:04.345
Stephie Kinney? Eww!

05:04.346 --> 05:07.515
Don't you remember in seventh
grade when I got ear acne,

05:07.516 --> 05:10.311
she was the one who told me I couldn't
sit with the cool girls anymore,

05:10.322 --> 05:12.812
and she made me sit
with the Scrabble Club nerds.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.939
She got you to wash
your lobes, didn't she?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.857
Her tough love worked.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.150
- I can't go.
- Why?!

05:18.151 --> 05:21.028
Because... I forgot,

05:21.029 --> 05:23.239
but I'm going to a goth concert.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.574
What the hell is that?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.827
It's just a scary place
where scary people congregate,

05:27.828 --> 05:29.912
and sometimes they make you
pierce your nipples.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.040
If that happens, I guess
I'll have to wear thick bras

05:33.041 --> 05:37.428
the rest of my life to cover up
my shameful breast earrings.

05:37.439 --> 05:39.537
I know what you're doing.
You're trying to scare me,

05:39.548 --> 05:41.966
and it's not going to work this time.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.592
- Grow up!
- Okay, well,

05:43.593 --> 05:45.553
I guess I'll go to the goth concert now,

05:45.554 --> 05:47.930
and, hopefully,
nothing bad will happen to me.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.139
Hopefully.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.641
Yeah, hopefully, I won't have to be

05:50.642 --> 05:52.309
forced to get a face tattoo

05:52.310 --> 05:53.477
Well, make it a pretty one.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.688
I guess if I have a face tattoo,

05:55.689 --> 05:58.732
I won't be able to be buried
in the same cemetery as Grandma.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.569
That's not true anymore,
'cause we're Reformed.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.320
Last chance.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.115
Nope, not bitin'.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.741
I love you.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.660
I love you.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.582
You fit in perfectly here.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.376
Your pale skin
from your iron deficiency.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.752
You should go goth.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.921
I do have the perfect delicate skin

06:20.922 --> 06:22.756
of Cate Blanchett's inner elbow,

06:22.757 --> 06:24.633
but I am here for one reason,

06:24.634 --> 06:26.260
and that is to make my mom mad,

06:26.261 --> 06:28.345
so she'll pay attention to me.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.889
Sounds familiar.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.349
That's how most people
start the lifestyle.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.101
Well, it's not working!

06:34.102 --> 06:36.020
I sent her a picture of that scary guy

06:36.021 --> 06:38.856
in the sexual pig mask,
and I got nothin'!

06:38.857 --> 06:41.191
That's Gunt. He's a paralegal.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.486
Hello, Gunt! I am Benji!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.739
I can't believe this.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.741
She just texted me a picture of her

06:48.742 --> 06:51.785
eating sushi with
my high school nemesis, Stephie.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.330
She's eating sushi with a fork!
That's cute!

06:54.331 --> 06:55.998
It's not cute. We're from the Midwest,

06:55.999 --> 06:58.542
so we don't have the proper
enzymes to digest sushi.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.800
I used to fight with my mom

06:59.811 --> 07:01.795
until I pretended to be
who she wanted me to be.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.505
Now every Sunday,
I take off my lipstick,

07:03.506 --> 07:05.883
I put on my dad's golf shirt,
and we hug. It's nice.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.886
Yeah. My mom thinks I'm a Herbalife rep.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.054
That's so smart!

07:10.055 --> 07:11.597
I should start lying to my parents

07:11.598 --> 07:13.766
instead of just disappointing
them all the time!

07:13.767 --> 07:16.060
You goth kids are, like, so insightful!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.895
This is amazing! I'm outta here!

07:17.896 --> 07:20.147
Wait! You're my wing-goth!

07:20.148 --> 07:21.815
You can't go, and...

07:21.816 --> 07:24.069
I think Gunt likes you!

07:25.236 --> 07:27.237
He does have a job, but...

07:27.238 --> 07:28.365
No, I gotta go.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.450
Cool studded belt.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.232
I had one like that in high school,

07:33.243 --> 07:34.870
but then it punctured the bucket seat

07:34.871 --> 07:36.789
in my dad's Porsche,
and he took it away.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.417
My dad loves his car
more than he loves me, too.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.461
You want to die with us?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.963
You mean, like, hang out? Yeah!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.177
Hello, Mother.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.221
Oh! Esther!

07:52.222 --> 07:54.139
What are you doing standing in the dark?

07:54.140 --> 07:57.059
I'm saving energy
like a responsible adult.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.311
I'm not sure that's what adults do.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.522
Do adults prepare fresh ginger tea

08:01.523 --> 08:03.649
for their weekend guests?

08:03.650 --> 08:06.443
Yes, they do, and that would be lovely.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.529
Allow me.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.991
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about the mixture

08:12.992 --> 08:14.493
of sex, sadness, and dark clothing

08:14.494 --> 08:16.745
that really does it for me, you know?

08:16.746 --> 08:19.248
Maybe it's 'cause I lost my
virginity at my uncle's funeral.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.959
Benji, I gotta be honest.
At first I thought you were a baby bat.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.794
But if you're into it, we have a group

08:23.795 --> 08:25.629
that gets together
to explore this stuff.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.340
Oh, yeah, well, I'm a fountain
of perpetual solitude,

08:28.341 --> 08:29.717
so I am available.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.720
We were supposed to meet up this
weekend, but the venue fell through...

08:32.721 --> 08:35.013
- black mold.
- Is that a band?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.683
Yes. But it's also a health problem.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.559
We had to cancel.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.730
Well, um, my roommate's out of town.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.273
I've got a great house for parties,

08:44.274 --> 08:46.860
and I've got a trampoline!

08:48.111 --> 08:50.112
Did that offend you guys?

08:50.113 --> 08:51.405
No, this is how I smile.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.865
I frickin' love trampolines.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.034
- Okay.
- I almost laughed.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.326
I hate you.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.120
Do you guys think the xylophone player

08:58.121 --> 09:00.539
was playing with real bones
or with those fake bones?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.000
<i>to the Kondo Method,</i>

09:03.001 --> 09:04.960
the best way to declutter your home

09:04.961 --> 09:07.004
is to ask yourself with every item,

09:07.005 --> 09:08.797
"Does this bring me joy?"

09:08.798 --> 09:11.550
Usually, when I declutter, I ask myself,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.886
"Does it bring ants into my home?"

09:13.887 --> 09:16.263
What do you want to do
about these flamingo slippers?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.348
Oh, my God, my flamingies!

09:18.349 --> 09:20.309
Pepper and Duncan,
I haven't seen you guys

09:20.310 --> 09:23.063
since we watched the Grammys!

09:24.981 --> 09:27.941
I mean, you do not bring me joy.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.569
Toss. See? I knew you can do it.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.739
Actually, this apartment looks so nice

09:33.740 --> 09:36.700
that I think we should do
a little dinner party

09:36.701 --> 09:37.868
with Stephie.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.369
What?! No!

09:39.370 --> 09:42.414
You can learn
a lot from Stephie, Esther.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.750
Do you know what she wore to sushi?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.878
Express pants with a crisp pleat.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.798
And she used her chopsticks

09:50.799 --> 09:53.175
like a native chopstick user.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.636
Now toss all these things into a bag.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.222
You're doing great!

09:58.223 --> 09:59.389
Okay.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.059
You guys stay quiet.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.355
So, Stephie, I guess
you haven't seen Esther

10:06.356 --> 10:08.107
since she was in the paper

10:08.108 --> 10:11.276
when she crashed into the mayor's house.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.696
We're still paying that off
in hundred-dollar increments.

10:14.697 --> 10:15.948
Monthly.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.699
Well, I've never been in the paper,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.827
except for when I was homecoming queen.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.665
Yeah. Well, I was on the front page.

10:25.834 --> 10:29.962
So, Stephie, um, your hair is so big.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.380
Is that a Bumpit?

10:31.381 --> 10:34.383
Um, no, it's just natural body.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.844
I use horse shampoo.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.512
Uh! Silly.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.972
Stephie, can you tell Esther

10:39.973 --> 10:42.850
about that Roth thingy
that you mentioned?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.768
Oh, IRAs, sure.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.146
Ooh, no, thank you. One of
my girlfriends had that,

10:47.147 --> 10:51.024
and it dislodged and permanently
damaged her cervix.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.945
Okay, have a little more
sparkling cider.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.617
Hey, it's Benji. It's, like, 8:15.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.203
Just wanted to make sure
you're still coming.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.038
I might cover up this beet hummus

11:05.039 --> 11:06.665
before the edges get crusty.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.959
Not that anything matters.
Life is darkness, but...

11:08.960 --> 11:12.004
would love to get a head count
on who might be coming.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.631
But, um... all right, cool.

11:14.632 --> 11:18.218
<i>♪ Well, I live with snakes and lizards ♪</i>

11:18.219 --> 11:21.847
<i>♪ And other things that crawl ♪</i>

11:21.848 --> 11:24.474
Stupid! Of course they're not coming!
You're a loser!

11:24.475 --> 11:26.685
You look like
Pete Wentz's Jewish cousin!

11:33.401 --> 11:34.401
You guys made it.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.736
Sorry I'm late.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.237
Gigi missed and eyelet on my boot,

11:37.238 --> 11:39.616
so we had to start over.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.910
You look like you're gonna cry.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.995
I was about to cry, yeah.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.830
Sick. Me, too.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.707
Am I okay to park after eight?

11:48.708 --> 11:49.875
I don't have a pass.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.001
Oh, yeah, of course.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.462
Coven?

11:55.256 --> 11:56.882
Mi dwelling su dwelling.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.675
Hi.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.178
Stephie, I can't help but notice

12:01.179 --> 12:04.264
that beautiful charm bracelet.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.142
Is that the Eiffel Tower?

12:07.143 --> 12:11.313
Yes, it is. Every charm represents a
different place that I've traveled to.

12:11.314 --> 12:15.067
So that is from
the France section at Epcot.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.028
Oh, I prefer the Eiffel
Tower in Las Vegas.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.905
Oh, I have one of those, too, actually.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.282
And this little cutie right here

12:22.283 --> 12:24.785
is from the Sandals Resort in Cancun,

12:24.786 --> 12:26.203
which I went to with all of my...

12:26.204 --> 12:27.287
Oh, no.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.208
Oh. Sandals... that's
where they let you have

12:31.209 --> 12:33.835
all you can eat,
including shrimp cocktail.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.171
They'd probably
have to change that policy

12:36.172 --> 12:39.091
once Hurricane Mary
went passing through.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.843
Tell her how much Mother loves shrimp.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.430
Are these flamingo slippers?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.725
My troubled cousin has a pair of these.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.978
Um, I'm so sorry.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.145
Thanks for finding those.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.815
It must be my second back-up pair.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.943
Esther! You said that you
had thrown them away!

12:57.944 --> 13:00.570
You've been doing so well!

13:00.571 --> 13:03.366
Come on, let's just toss 'em right now.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.286
Okay, I'll just throw these

13:07.287 --> 13:10.455
into that irreversibly
wet, nasty trash can.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.457
Why not?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.167
I can't.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.711
I don't want to throw them away.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.255
I love them. They make me laugh.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.091
And they do bring me joy.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.385
Do you really want me
to be a boring, basic,

13:23.386 --> 13:25.220
cookie-cutter person like Stephie?

13:25.221 --> 13:28.765
Don't embarrass
our dinner guest like that!

13:28.766 --> 13:30.475
She's mean, and she's a liar.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.437
I know she lied about her Bumpit.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.563
Let me see that.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.689
- Aah! Ow! Ow!
- Oh, wow.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.316
Oh, God, that is...

13:37.317 --> 13:39.234
Damn. That is lustrous.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.446
It is like a hair waterfall.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.407
I have never been so
embarrassed in my entire life,

13:45.408 --> 13:46.783
and I'm leaving!

13:46.784 --> 13:48.326
I need some fresh air!

13:48.327 --> 13:50.996
- Mom, don't!
- No!

13:50.997 --> 13:55.501
This is exactly
how I pictured this going.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.882
Hey, you wouldn't believe it,

14:01.883 --> 14:04.259
but I'm actually throwing
a successful party right now!

14:04.260 --> 14:06.303
Actually, gathering.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.056
Uh, goths, we gather. We don't party.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.267
Okay, well, I'm freaking out,

14:10.278 --> 14:12.131
'cause my mom and I
just got into a huge fight,

14:12.142 --> 14:14.311
and she left, and I don't
know where she is!

14:14.312 --> 14:16.146
And I paged all the Joann Fabrics

14:16.147 --> 14:18.690
within driving distance,
and she's not at any of them.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.108
I'm sure everything's okay.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.526
Why don't you just come here?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.904
Nothing helps deal
with parental problems

14:23.905 --> 14:25.113
like hanging with goths.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.532
Right?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.078
Esther, do not come here.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.997
Whatever you do, do not come here.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.294
<i>Damn, an orgy?! What kind?</i>

14:39.295 --> 14:41.296
What kind? An orgy-orgy.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.937
<i>If you're gonna be
such a square about it,</i>

14:42.948 --> 14:45.082
<i>then just tell them to put
their clothes on and go home.</i>

14:45.093 --> 14:47.302
I don't know, man. I've never
had a successful party,

14:47.303 --> 14:49.304
and I want to be a good host.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.182
<i>I got it. Just fake it while
they're still there, okay?</i>

14:52.183 --> 14:53.475
<i>So take your shirt off,</i>

14:53.476 --> 14:55.227
<i>rub some coconut oil on your skin,</i>

14:55.228 --> 14:57.123
<i>and pretend you just finished
orgying in another room.</i>

14:58.356 --> 14:59.732
I gotta go, dude! I gotta go!

15:03.111 --> 15:05.112
Dude, you hiding?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.364
No. I, um...

15:07.365 --> 15:09.241
I had a really late lunch,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.284
and I combined starch and protein,

15:11.285 --> 15:13.078
and now I'm just sort of cramping up

15:13.079 --> 15:15.539
after all the mutually enjoyable
sex I've been having.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.915
You gotta pace yourself.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.208
Should we go somewhere else?

15:18.209 --> 15:20.293
No. No, you guys have fun in here.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.672
I'm gonna get back
out there for round five.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.676
- Mom?
- Yeah?

15:27.677 --> 15:29.845
I have been looking everywhere for you.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.429
Well, you found me.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.557
Yeah, because I came in
here to use the bathroom.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.308
Why are you even in an alcohol bar?

15:35.309 --> 15:36.393
You don't drink.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.519
Well, I do now.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.895
I'm three deep.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.814
Three glasses?

15:40.815 --> 15:42.607
No, three sips.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.695
I'm here in this bar
with all the other bad moms.

15:46.696 --> 15:47.947
- Right, Kathy?
- Oh!

15:48.990 --> 15:51.408
This is where I belong.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.993
I guess I belong here, too,

15:52.994 --> 15:54.828
'cause you think I'm a bad daughter.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.414
Bartender, will you
please serve me up a cup

15:57.415 --> 15:59.124
of your least grossest wine?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.924
What's up, guys?

16:07.925 --> 16:09.302
Great... great work.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.470
Hey.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.681
Oh! Ha! Thank you.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.683
I'm actually in between
intervals right now.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.059
It's my recovery period.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
Just gonna grab a seltzer water.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.522
D'Artagnan, lookin' good!

16:22.523 --> 16:24.942
You're gonna feel that
in your legs tomorrow.

16:27.737 --> 16:31.031
Guys, can we please label our cups?!

16:31.032 --> 16:32.574
I put markers out!

16:32.575 --> 16:35.119
Black souls, green planet!
This is nothing new!

16:36.537 --> 16:39.289
Baby bat, we're feeling
a little left out.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.208
Are you avoiding us?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.959
No! I think you're great.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.961
I'm just, uh, getting warmed up for you.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.298
Mm! I like the sound of that.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.343
Let's do it right here.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.470
I-I-I have an STD!

16:53.471 --> 16:55.011
Wait. What?

16:55.022 --> 16:56.146
Yeah, it's a really bad one.

16:56.157 --> 16:58.183
I had to burn all my boxer
briefs in a bonfire.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.186
You have an STD and you've been
having sex with the entire party?

17:01.187 --> 17:02.520
Dude!

17:02.521 --> 17:05.815
Coven, time-out! Lights on!

17:05.816 --> 17:07.608
We have an unsafe player.

17:07.619 --> 17:09.152
- Whoa!
- Are you serious?

17:09.153 --> 17:12.364
Um... hey.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.657
Oh! 'Scuse me, honey,

17:14.659 --> 17:16.910
but I think that you charged me wrong.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.078
This is full price.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.413
I ordered during happy hour!

17:20.414 --> 17:21.665
Happy hour ended at seven.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.251
Your receipt, 7:01.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.795
Can't do nothin' about that.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.548
Mom, if you say you ordered
those drinks at happy hour,

17:29.549 --> 17:32.551
- then you're paying the happy hour price.
- Oh, it's fine.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.345
No, it's not. That's not fair.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.348
Hear ye! Hear ye!

17:38.349 --> 17:41.142
I want all the patrons
in this bar to know

17:41.143 --> 17:43.395
that you are supporting an establishment

17:43.396 --> 17:46.231
that wants to stick it to the consumer!

17:46.232 --> 17:48.385
Ma'am, this isn't a cabaret.
Could you please sit down?

17:48.396 --> 17:50.652
Ooh! Whoa! Ohh! Ohh!

17:50.653 --> 17:52.654
I'm gonna fall because
I've been over-served!

17:52.655 --> 17:55.031
Okay, fine, fine. I will get you
the happy hour price, okay?

17:55.032 --> 17:57.200
Just sit down.
And the next round's on me.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.119
Thank you. That's all we wanted.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.121
Instead of alcohols for our next round,

18:01.122 --> 18:03.123
could we just have, like,
a big plate of nachos?

18:03.124 --> 18:05.417
- Yeah!
- Black or pinto beans?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.044
- Both, of course!
- Both, yes!

18:09.797 --> 18:11.381
I bet Stephie never got her mom

18:11.382 --> 18:13.258
a plate of double-bean courtesy nachos.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.427
Oh, sweetie,

18:15.428 --> 18:18.179
I just wanted you to be <i>like</i> Stephie,

18:18.180 --> 18:20.932
because Stephie seemed
like the kind of girl

18:20.933 --> 18:22.851
that could take care of herself.

18:22.852 --> 18:27.022
But now I see you are that kind of girl

18:27.023 --> 18:32.068
in your own wacky, weirdo, loser way.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.570
I just want you to know,

18:33.571 --> 18:35.363
I didn't make that Scooter Taco video

18:35.364 --> 18:37.198
to embarrass myself for no reason.

18:37.199 --> 18:41.161
I made it to embarrass myself
for a $20 gift certificate.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.456
$20? That's six breakfasts!

18:44.457 --> 18:46.458
Did you hear that, Kath...? Oh.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.461
Oh, Kathy? Um, Kathy,
you should wake up.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.672
Is Kathy dead? I'm a little concerned.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.466
Denizens of darkness, I'm sorry.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.217
We may have a safety issue.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.220
Please come forward if you've
had sex with this bat.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.430
You may be at risk.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.099
- No. You?
- You?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.727
Did anyone have sex with this guy?

19:05.936 --> 19:07.480
I did.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.193
Never mind. Different dude.

19:13.194 --> 19:17.447
I'm sorry. I lied about
giving STDs to everyone

19:17.448 --> 19:20.241
I lied about having sex with.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.951
I think you're all really cool,

19:21.952 --> 19:24.746
but I didn't realize this
was gonna be a sex party.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.708
The e-vite explicitly states
to bring condoms and lube.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.044
I skimmed the email. That's my B.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.420
Let's go. Denny's is open,

19:32.421 --> 19:34.255
and Daddy wants a Grand Slam.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.050
No, don't go! We can hang!

19:37.051 --> 19:38.718
Dog collar power bottoms,

19:38.719 --> 19:40.512
we can play Risk or something.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.971
Pig mascot, you're the coolest!

19:41.972 --> 19:44.182
Just... We can be friends!

19:44.183 --> 19:46.351
All the suicide girls,
you're all leaving?

19:46.352 --> 19:49.397
I'd love to watch a Tim Burton
film with you guys anytime!

19:50.481 --> 19:51.564
<i>Take your seats.</i>

19:51.565 --> 19:54.567
<i>It's time for the recital!</i>

19:54.568 --> 19:57.654
Let me just get the videotape
organized for Dad!

19:57.655 --> 19:59.781
We tape all of her performances.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.533
I'm very familiar
with these dance videos.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.577
She made us watch them on her
birthday for seven hours.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.621
You say that like it's a bad thing.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.956
Okay!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.833
Here comes the tap-dancing doggy!

Oh! Excellent!

20:27.643 --> 20:29.894
Wonderful! You still got it!

20:29.895 --> 20:31.771
That was great. I loved it.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.275
But, um, you might
want to take that collar off.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.402
Why? I found it
in your brother's closet.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.446
I guess it's from
your grandparents' old dog?

20:39.447 --> 20:43.575
It actually belongs to a
paralegal-slash-submissive named Gunt.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.827
Oh. Gunt has a doggy?

20:45.828 --> 20:47.036
Oh, for heaven's sakes!

20:47.037 --> 20:48.788
It's a sex collar!

20:48.789 --> 20:50.250
Come on! Let's go wash your neck!
