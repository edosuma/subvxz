WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:05.104
Sue-Ann!

00:07.675 --> 00:09.775
(grunts)

00:11.379 --> 00:12.978
Barrett is not smarter
than we are!

00:13.047 --> 00:15.381
Is it possible that
he didn't kill Lasalle?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.382
No!

00:16.450 --> 00:17.649
You do not want
to mess with me

00:17.718 --> 00:19.485
or any of my people.
You're already a man down,

00:19.553 --> 00:20.986
why risk anyone else?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.254
SUE-ANN:
<i> Eddie told me</i>

00:22.323 --> 00:23.455
he had to kill him.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.057
<i> That he did it to protect</i>

00:25.126 --> 00:26.291
<i> his lost children.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.293
HANNAH:
<i> Eddie Barrett is a cult leader?</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:29.595
GREGORIO:
<i> Yeah, well, he collects</i>
<i> troubled souls</i>

00:29.663 --> 00:31.497
<i> and gives them hope again.</i>

00:31.565 --> 00:32.664
PRIDE:
Federal agents!

00:32.733 --> 00:34.299
We have a lawful warrant

00:34.368 --> 00:35.667
for the arrest of
Edward Barrett.

00:35.736 --> 00:36.802
Dwayne.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.405
Our paths have been chosen.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.576
Just need to see
how it plays out.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.353
PRIDE:
Barrett.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.988
You need to come with us.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.825
(woman screams)
Whoa, whoa.
No weapons.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.894
Just stay calm.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.998
There's no need
for violence.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.533
You don't want us
in the house,

01:07.601 --> 01:09.668
just send Eddie out.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.489
You're Special Agent Pride?

01:30.558 --> 01:31.890
That's right.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.326
I have a message
for you from Eddie.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.695
NCIS needs
to leave.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.831
All except for you, Pride.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.133
You're invited inside.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.404
Okay, that's-that's
a terrible idea.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.039
I'm with Sebastian.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.441
We're not letting you
go in alone, Dwayne.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.214
Okay, I'll come.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.221
Did you hear
what we just said?

02:02.289 --> 02:04.156
You go in there
and suddenly they have

02:04.225 --> 02:05.724
a federal agent
as a hostage.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.393
I've come too
far to get Eddie.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.563
And I'm not letting
him disappear again.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.338
Let's go.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.251
(engine starts)

02:35.289 --> 02:37.523
I accept your
invitation.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.536
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

02:50.604 --> 02:53.138
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪

02:53.207 --> 02:55.641
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

02:55.709 --> 02:57.142
♪ How, how, how, how ♪

02:57.211 --> 02:59.344
♪ Hey, hey ♪

03:05.186 --> 03:06.552
♪ You gotta come on. ♪

03:09.023 --> 03:11.790
All of Eddie's followers
went back into the house?

03:11.859 --> 03:14.259
So, what, we're just gonna
leave Pride in there?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.260
No, we're not leaving anyone.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.762
Well, what are we gonna do?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.263
We're gonna wait
for the cavalry.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.699
(sirens wailing in distance)

03:22.303 --> 03:23.402
SEBASTIAN:
Who called them?

03:23.470 --> 03:25.103
I did.
Before we arrived

03:25.172 --> 03:26.338
at the plantation.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.677
Guessing Pride knows?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.812
I am sure he does.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.315
This is SOP
in a situation like this.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.250
We need to know every detail

03:38.319 --> 03:40.118
about what's going on
in that house,

03:40.187 --> 03:41.987
everyone in it
and what Eddie wants.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.924
Well, maybe we should
start with this.

03:45.993 --> 03:46.992
PRIDE:
There's no need for violence.

03:47.061 --> 03:49.127
Nice one, T.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.862
Get the video over to Patton.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.798
And find out about these guys.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.934
We need to stop this
before it gets critical.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.041
I feel like
that ship has sailed.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.812
Lot of supplies here.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.615
Looks like you're
expecting a visit.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.650
How many people are here?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.319
How many kids are here?

04:14.388 --> 04:16.321
BARRETT: Tom won't
answer you, Dwayne.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.523
Well, then maybe you can.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.126
Oh, we'll have plenty
of time to talk.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.311
Gonna let me be
that close to my weapon?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.680
It's all about trust here.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.416
Why would you trust me
not to take the gun back?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.018
I know you want to kill me.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.020
But I trust you won't
turn the current situation

04:48.088 --> 04:50.589
into a catastrophe.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.058
Not in front of the kids,
at least.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.493
Tom,

04:54.561 --> 04:56.428
why don't you make
Dwayne some lunch?

04:56.497 --> 04:59.631
And then we can have
a good, long chat.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.943
Okay, I'm gathering
blueprints

05:12.012 --> 05:13.245
and schematics
for the plantation house.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.713
But I got to warn you,

05:14.782 --> 05:16.548
these records are, like,
a hundred years old.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.083
Whatever you can find will help.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.885
I'm using your video
to try to ID

05:19.953 --> 05:21.453
these followers
using facial recognition.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.055
Might take a while.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.423
Well, Sebastian's
on his way back

05:24.491 --> 05:26.425
to help you now.
PATTON: Copy that.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.294
Tammy Gregorio,
this is Joe Carson,

05:29.363 --> 05:31.430
FBI on-scene commander.
Thanks for coming.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.965
My comms team is setting up a
dedicated line into the house.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.868
I'm trying to get control
of the utilities, as well.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.737
I think they're running
electric on a generator.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.606
So you estimate 40 inside?
Men, women and children.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.909
And one very stubborn
NCIS agent.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.578
We're mobilizing drones,
setting up snipers.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.947
I also have a team ready
to breach if we need to.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.549
It just feels like
all this manpower

05:50.617 --> 05:51.883
only makes
the circumstances worse.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.285
You're 100% on that.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.320
The best way out
is through negotiations.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.621
We're gonna handle those.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.056
Yeah.
Yes, ma'am.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.157
For what it's worth,

05:59.226 --> 06:00.659
I've been doing this
for ten years.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.627
I can smell violence in the air.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.830
It's all over this place.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.675
That's a lot
of PB and J, huh?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.510
Oh, I mean, we got
turkey, you know,

06:18.579 --> 06:20.011
if you have an
allergy or anything.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.114
No, I-I don't.
I'm just...

06:22.182 --> 06:24.583
I'm not particularly
hungry right now.

06:24.651 --> 06:25.684
Really?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.352
'Cause I'm always starving.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.122
My mom says it's 'cause
I'm growing a mile a minute.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.623
(chuckles)

06:31.692 --> 06:33.091
Your mom here?
Yeah.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.627
She's downstairs.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.963
How'd you end up with Eddie?

06:38.031 --> 06:40.766
We were... drawn to him.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.300
Like magnets.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.969
That's how
Eddie puts it.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.471
But how was it really?

06:46.540 --> 06:49.307
Well, my mom and I
were at a shelter.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.343
Lost our house in a storm.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.479
Eddie came by one day
and gave us some clothes,

06:54.548 --> 06:56.448
offered us a place to stay.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.616
Here.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.619
What do you do here?

07:00.687 --> 07:02.053
Normal stuff.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.388
My mom's a substitute teacher,

07:03.457 --> 07:05.056
so she does school for us.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.959
We play games,
there's an Xbox.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.662
Anything else?

07:10.731 --> 07:13.965
He's asking
if you deal drugs, Tom.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.734
No, nothing like that.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.235
A lot of chores,
though.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.404
It's good to keep busy.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.840
I think it's time to go
deliver those sandwiches.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.208
Right.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.717
What do you think
of our little home?

07:32.786 --> 07:36.154
Not the word that comes to mind.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.590
All these people...

07:38.659 --> 07:41.560
blindly doing
what you tell them.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.728
Deal drugs.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.932
Murder federal agents
and their brothers.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.700
Everyone's here
because they want to be.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.202
They can leave
at any time.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.436
Not now they can't.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.571
That's because of you.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.739
I'm not
brainwashing anyone.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.741
I'm just a beacon in the dark.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.211
They were drawn to me.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.046
Even you.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.782
Your magnetism didn't draw me.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.784
No.
You're here to kill me.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.786
I'm here to arrest you.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.187
I don't want anyone else

08:09.256 --> 08:10.755
to get hurt.
(phone ringing)

08:10.824 --> 08:14.593
If you believe that,
you're lying to yourself.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.731
Dwayne Pride's phone.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.899
HANNAH:
Mr. Barrett?

08:20.968 --> 08:22.767
This is Special
Agent Khoury

08:22.836 --> 08:24.536
and Special
Agent Gregorio.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.304
What can I do for you?

08:26.373 --> 08:29.040
You can tell us Special Agent
Pride is all right.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.775
Dwayne's peachy.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.811
HANNAH:
Great. You can send him out

08:32.880 --> 08:36.248
and surrender yourself.
That's not really the plan.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.483
The house is surrounded,
Barrett.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.885
Options are limited here.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.887
So, if you want to talk,
maybe negotiate

08:41.955 --> 08:43.788
your way out, we're ready.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.657
What do you want?

08:45.726 --> 08:48.460
Oh...

08:48.529 --> 08:51.630
I got everything I need.

09:06.089 --> 09:07.555
Any luck with
Tammy's video footage

09:07.623 --> 09:09.123
of the people that are
staying with Eddie?

09:09.192 --> 09:12.059
Yes. Actually, it was easy
to identify a bunch of them.

09:12.128 --> 09:13.828
Ex-cons, wanted felons, what?

09:13.896 --> 09:15.129
Yeah, a couple.

09:15.198 --> 09:16.697
They were easy to ID,
but the rest?

09:16.766 --> 09:18.532
No criminal records.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.335
Just bankruptcy,
bad divorces, lost jobs.

09:21.404 --> 09:23.070
So, we're not dealing
with a militia.

09:23.139 --> 09:25.239
We're just dealing
with broken people?

09:25.308 --> 09:26.407
And their children.

09:26.476 --> 09:28.209
(sighs)

09:28.277 --> 09:29.910
Well, they're still
armed to the teeth.

09:29.979 --> 09:32.813
At least a few of them are
willing to die for Eddie.

09:32.882 --> 09:34.682
One wrong move out there
and this makes Waco

09:34.751 --> 09:36.317
look like a walk
in the park.

09:36.386 --> 09:38.719
Well, we better not make
a wrong move, then.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.721
Hey, what are you
doing here, Doc?

09:40.790 --> 09:42.923
Making sure this situation
doesn't go critical.

09:42.992 --> 09:44.658
Pride's being held hostage.

09:44.727 --> 09:46.027
You need all the help
you can get.

09:46.095 --> 09:47.395
We don't have any bodies.

09:47.463 --> 09:48.529
At least not yet.

09:48.598 --> 09:49.930
Well, let's keep
it that way.

09:49.999 --> 09:52.500
And I am a Renaissance
woman, Sebastian.

09:52.568 --> 09:55.102
I have more to offer than
an autopsy or a tox screen.

09:55.171 --> 09:57.405
No, yeah, of course.
That's not what I...
For instance,

09:57.473 --> 09:59.206
I know a great deal about

09:59.275 --> 10:01.842
the plantation houses
of Jeanerette, Louisiana.

10:01.911 --> 10:02.943
You do?

10:03.012 --> 10:05.079
I worked a cold case there
a few years ago.

10:05.148 --> 10:06.147
Remains of the victim

10:06.215 --> 10:07.915
were found very close
to this house.

10:07.984 --> 10:09.350
Body was almost
100 years old.

10:09.419 --> 10:11.185
Moonshiner from Prohibition.

10:11.254 --> 10:12.386
That's pretty cool.
It is.

10:12.455 --> 10:13.754
But it also may be relevant,

10:13.823 --> 10:14.922
and if you move out the way,

10:14.991 --> 10:16.424
I'll pull the murder file.

10:26.869 --> 10:30.604
What do they think
the plan is, Eddie?

10:30.673 --> 10:34.475
Dozens of federal
agents outside.

10:36.179 --> 10:38.112
Do people know what...

10:38.181 --> 10:40.648
it is that you
really want?

10:40.716 --> 10:42.950
And what is it I want?

10:45.388 --> 10:46.620
War.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.622
No.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.624
I want the agents to leave.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.960
Let us live our lives here.

10:53.029 --> 10:55.129
It's just you and me, Eddie.

10:55.198 --> 10:57.198
There's no reason to lie.

10:58.568 --> 11:00.668
Peace isn't what you want.

11:00.736 --> 11:03.003
Peace isn't what
you want either, Dwayne.

11:03.072 --> 11:05.739
So you can stop pretending

11:05.808 --> 11:07.908
you came into this house
for law and order.

11:07.977 --> 11:09.577
I'm the man you think
killed your friend

11:09.645 --> 11:11.278
and his brother.
Not an opinion.

11:11.347 --> 11:12.947
You want vengeance.

11:13.015 --> 11:15.583
All these people are here...

11:15.651 --> 11:18.552
because you offered them
a better life.

11:20.656 --> 11:22.790
I want them to be able to...

11:22.859 --> 11:25.326
walk out and find it.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.661
(laughs)
You say all the
right things.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.296
But you don't
mean them.

11:29.365 --> 11:30.965
Not trying
to con you, Eddie.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.967
Then speak the truth.

11:33.035 --> 11:35.169
Since it's just you and me.

11:35.238 --> 11:37.438
The world is chaos.

11:37.507 --> 11:39.807
Random violence,
destruction.

11:39.876 --> 11:41.775
Pain.

11:41.844 --> 11:44.311
We all need to
<i> accept</i> the chaos,

11:44.380 --> 11:46.547
find peace within
the disorder.

11:46.616 --> 11:50.217
Is that how you rationalize the
trail of death you left behind?

11:50.286 --> 11:52.486
Death is just another
reality of the chaos.

11:52.555 --> 11:54.788
And everyone's so afraid of it.

11:54.857 --> 11:57.358
But death isn't an absolute.

11:57.426 --> 11:58.692
Uh, that's not my experience.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.060
Isn't it?

12:00.129 --> 12:01.662
I've learned about you.

12:01.731 --> 12:05.032
You were dead on an
operating table, and yet,

12:05.101 --> 12:06.200
here you are.

12:06.269 --> 12:08.202
That is not
any of your business.

12:08.271 --> 12:10.271
Let me show you something.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.475
I was reborn, too.

12:14.544 --> 12:17.311
Years ago.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.881
Fire at the group home
you were raised in.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.150
I was covered in
third-degree burns.

12:23.219 --> 12:24.852
They were sure
I was gonna die.

12:24.921 --> 12:26.820
But I survived.

12:26.889 --> 12:29.557
I was in the hospital for
months in excruciating pain.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.091
Do you know
what that pain taught me?

12:31.160 --> 12:33.093
Not to play with matches?
(chuckles)

12:33.162 --> 12:37.398
It taught me to love
and respect the chaos.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.533
It was a revelation.

12:39.602 --> 12:41.936
And I'm going
to share that revelation

12:42.004 --> 12:43.704
with your federal agents

12:43.773 --> 12:46.073
and the world.

12:49.845 --> 12:51.111
You okay, Tom?

12:51.180 --> 12:52.613
Dwayne,
stay where the hell you are!

12:54.116 --> 12:55.349
Leave the mess, Tom.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.321
(ringtone playing)

13:03.492 --> 13:05.526
Dwayne, I've got to deal
with something.

13:05.595 --> 13:08.195
I can't wait for you to see it.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.701
(sighs)

13:29.552 --> 13:31.952
How are we gonna
get Eddie to negotiate?

13:32.021 --> 13:33.821
I don't know if he will.

13:33.889 --> 13:35.789
Nothing about his
action or profile suggest

13:35.858 --> 13:38.125
that he can be relied
on to act reasonably.

13:38.194 --> 13:41.161
So it's a waiting game.
We just don't let it escalate.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.230
(ringtone playing)

13:44.467 --> 13:46.500
Sebastian, what you got?
Who's that?

13:46.569 --> 13:48.502
Patton tracked a call
from the cell phone

13:48.571 --> 13:50.337
inside the plantation
right after we arrived.

13:50.406 --> 13:52.339
It went to an outside number,
then that outside number

13:52.408 --> 13:54.608
made at least two phone calls
to local media.

13:54.677 --> 13:55.776
He alerted the media.

13:55.845 --> 13:57.611
Yeah.
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, I followed up.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.446
Apparently, Eddie told them all
that there was a standoff,

13:59.515 --> 14:00.948
that the feds were unlawfully

14:01.017 --> 14:03.017
trying to arrest him
and harass his family,

14:03.085 --> 14:05.586
and that he had
an NCIS agent inside.

14:05.655 --> 14:07.421
Thanks, Sebastian.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.323
Eddie invited them

14:09.392 --> 14:11.525
to bear witness.

14:13.362 --> 14:14.795
What's going on
out there?

14:14.864 --> 14:16.897
Attention is being paid.

14:20.770 --> 14:23.304
The media.

14:23.372 --> 14:25.639
You're staging a
conflict for them.

14:25.708 --> 14:27.341
Conflict is inevitable.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.677
You know that
as well as I do.

14:29.745 --> 14:33.213
Any action we take
causes a reaction.

14:33.282 --> 14:34.815
Like killing my friend.

14:34.884 --> 14:38.052
Lasalle dies, you get angry,
you come after me.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.354
There's consequences.

14:40.423 --> 14:42.489
But it's all been in
the shadows until now.

14:42.558 --> 14:44.124
Where you thrive.

14:44.193 --> 14:46.560
<i> This</i> is where I thrive,
with family.

14:46.629 --> 14:48.796
They're not your family.

14:48.864 --> 14:50.698
They're your victims.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.334
You created this
whole situation.

14:53.402 --> 14:55.002
You're gonna sacrifice 'em all.

14:55.071 --> 14:58.205
No, Dwayne.
You did this by coming after me.

14:58.274 --> 15:02.076
No.
And you've done it to the people
you claim to love, as well.

15:02.144 --> 15:04.244
Now sit back.

15:04.313 --> 15:06.313
Enjoy the show.

15:15.991 --> 15:19.126
(helicopter whirring)

15:24.834 --> 15:26.734
We've got a problem.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.103
There's movement on the
plantation grounds.

15:29.171 --> 15:30.537
Someone's come out of the house.

15:30.606 --> 15:32.506
Any chance he's trying
to flee the standoff?

15:32.575 --> 15:34.174
CARSON:
Doesn't seem like it.

15:34.243 --> 15:36.176
He appears to be armed.

15:36.245 --> 15:37.244
Crap.

15:38.581 --> 15:40.013
I've got a sniper ready.

15:42.118 --> 15:46.086
To the man leaving the house:
halt immediately.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.889
Drop your weapon,
get on the ground.

15:48.958 --> 15:53.494
If you don't comply, we will
be forced to take action.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.597
He gets to the fence line,
you take him out.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.031
This is what
they want.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.733
They want for us to
shoot someone on TV.

15:59.802 --> 16:02.002
What the hell, Gregorio?
Do not engage!

16:03.139 --> 16:05.672
Do not fire!
Hold your fire!

16:07.376 --> 16:08.876
(grunting)

16:08.944 --> 16:10.711
(overlapping chatter)

16:10.780 --> 16:12.679
You okay?
Yeah.

16:17.153 --> 16:19.319
It's a toy gun.

16:19.388 --> 16:21.955
What?

16:24.860 --> 16:26.660
Nice work, guys.

16:26.729 --> 16:28.095
EDDIE:
Phil had one job.

16:28.164 --> 16:30.297
How'd he screw it up?

16:30.366 --> 16:31.765
And how'd they get
through the gate?

16:31.834 --> 16:34.268
I thought we had it
all blocked off.

16:34.336 --> 16:36.637
We're not gonna get
an opportunity like that again.

16:36.705 --> 16:39.440
My people aren't gonna
let this escalate, Eddie.

16:39.508 --> 16:41.942
You need to accept that
and start talking to 'em.

16:42.011 --> 16:43.410
You think I'm gonna surrender.

16:43.479 --> 16:46.346
I think
it's your only option here.

16:46.415 --> 16:49.349
And it's what's best
for all these folks

16:49.418 --> 16:51.852
who you love so much.

16:51.921 --> 16:53.253
I've got plenty of options.

16:53.322 --> 16:55.522
Not so sure
even you believe that.

16:55.591 --> 16:58.058
Go back inside, Dwayne.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.745
(helicopter continues whirring)

17:38.267 --> 17:40.267
(grunts softly)

17:46.742 --> 17:48.742
You need to move
away from there.

18:02.955 --> 18:05.189
Tom.

18:09.162 --> 18:11.929
Why don't you put the gun down
before you hurt somebody?

18:11.998 --> 18:13.798
I'm protecting my family.

18:13.866 --> 18:15.866
I know you feel that way,

18:15.935 --> 18:19.436
and we can talk about it,
but the safety is off.

18:19.505 --> 18:21.772
And your finger's
on the trigger.

18:21.841 --> 18:23.941
I know how a gun works.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.843
I'm sure you do.

18:27.113 --> 18:29.547
But you don't
know how it feels

18:29.615 --> 18:31.615
to take a life.

18:33.286 --> 18:36.587
And there's no reason
to learn today.

18:36.656 --> 18:39.256
You're trying
to get us all killed.

18:39.325 --> 18:41.458
I'm trying to help you.

18:43.196 --> 18:46.630
He told us you'd lie,
try to manipulate us.

18:46.699 --> 18:49.433
I'm not.

18:49.502 --> 18:51.802
It's dangerous here.

18:53.372 --> 18:55.272
Don't take my word for it.

18:55.341 --> 18:56.740
Look. Look.

18:56.809 --> 18:58.509
Look for yourself.
These wires.

18:58.578 --> 19:00.578
You see 'em?

19:02.215 --> 19:04.849
What do you
think they are?

19:04.917 --> 19:06.784
I don't... I don't know.

19:06.853 --> 19:09.420
For, uh...
for electricity.

19:09.488 --> 19:11.021
The TV.

19:11.090 --> 19:13.257
Except they're not connected
to the TV, and they're not

19:13.326 --> 19:15.292
keeping the lights on.

19:15.361 --> 19:19.697
I'm guessing
that these wires run

19:19.765 --> 19:21.298
throughout the whole house.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.200
What are you saying?

19:23.269 --> 19:25.369
I think the house is rigged.

19:26.606 --> 19:29.206
I'm not sure
for what,

19:29.275 --> 19:31.008
but I'm certain it's bad.

19:32.745 --> 19:34.712
But the good news is,

19:34.780 --> 19:36.814
you and me--

19:36.883 --> 19:39.250
we can fix the situation.

19:40.753 --> 19:43.454
I want to get everyone
out of here safely,

19:43.522 --> 19:44.955
and the first step

19:45.024 --> 19:49.326
to us doing that is...

19:49.395 --> 19:51.695
you not shooting me.

19:51.764 --> 19:53.731
I, uh...

19:53.799 --> 19:55.199
I don't know.

19:55.268 --> 19:57.268
(panting)

19:58.771 --> 20:00.704
Well, why don't we start by you

20:00.773 --> 20:03.507
putting the gun down, and
just take it from there, okay?

20:03.576 --> 20:04.875
What the hell are you doing?!

20:04.944 --> 20:06.377
(grunts)

20:06.445 --> 20:08.145
Hey, hey. Come on, stop!
He didn't hurt me.

20:08.214 --> 20:11.649
Dwayne's destiny is not
for you to decide.

20:11.717 --> 20:13.384
Learn your place.

20:23.429 --> 20:25.396
All right, what you got?

20:25.464 --> 20:28.499
Moonshine, and lots of it,
going back to the 1920s.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.234
Jeanerrette was the epicenter
for illegal alcohol

20:30.303 --> 20:31.669
during Prohibition.

20:31.737 --> 20:33.370
The Mississippi gave
the moonshiners

20:33.439 --> 20:34.772
a perfect delivery system.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.273
Okay, those are
some interesting facts,

20:36.342 --> 20:37.574
but how does that help us today?

20:37.643 --> 20:39.009
The moonshiners had
to be able

20:39.078 --> 20:40.778
to move their product
out of sight,

20:40.846 --> 20:44.348
so, they built tunnels
under the plantation houses.

20:44.417 --> 20:47.551
PATTON :
I pulled up archeological
satellite images of the area.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.920
Looks like Pac-Man under there.
PATTON:
That's right.

20:49.989 --> 20:51.855
And they go directly
under Eddie's house.

20:51.924 --> 20:54.091
Okay, well, we can work with
that. How do we gain access?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.893
The closest entrance is
about a half a mile

20:55.962 --> 20:57.261
from where you are now.

20:57.330 --> 20:59.263
Sebastian's on his way
to meet you.

20:59.332 --> 21:01.699
And he's bringing
some spelunking equipment.

21:01.767 --> 21:05.035
Of course he is.
Probably his own, monogrammed.

21:05.104 --> 21:07.404
Those tunnels haven't been used
in almost 100 years.

21:07.473 --> 21:09.106
Better safe than sorry.

21:09.175 --> 21:11.475
You want to roshambo for who
goes tunneling with Sebastian?

21:11.544 --> 21:13.310
No, I'll go.
You stay here, keep things calm.

21:13.379 --> 21:15.779
Yeah. Why does it feel like
you got the easier assignment?

21:15.848 --> 21:18.816
(scoffs)
All right.

21:18.884 --> 21:21.318
Nice work, you guys.

21:22.355 --> 21:23.988
I'm sorry about Tom.

21:24.056 --> 21:26.156
I thought he knew how
all this was supposed to go.

21:26.225 --> 21:27.925
He should never
have touched your gun.

21:27.994 --> 21:29.593
Kids can be impulsive,

21:29.662 --> 21:31.962
especially when
they're under stress.

21:32.031 --> 21:33.797
Never had any of my own.

21:33.866 --> 21:35.366
Not that I know of.

21:36.402 --> 21:38.402
The key with children

21:38.471 --> 21:41.305
is helping them understand
when they've made mistakes

21:41.374 --> 21:43.307
and keeping them safe.

21:43.376 --> 21:44.641
Kind of a pain in the ass,

21:44.710 --> 21:46.510
right?
They're not helping you.

21:46.579 --> 21:48.078
That's for sure.

21:49.081 --> 21:51.415
Having the kids here.

21:51.484 --> 21:52.916
You think
it'll make a statement,

21:52.985 --> 21:55.986
but it's only dragging out
the standoff.

21:58.524 --> 22:00.924
I see what you're getting at.

22:00.993 --> 22:03.994
Honestly, the Feds?

22:05.698 --> 22:08.032
They won't engage
with them here.

22:08.100 --> 22:11.268
Media, they got a
short attention span.

22:11.337 --> 22:13.837
You don't want
them to get bored.

22:13.906 --> 22:15.873
You think you know
what I have planned.

22:15.941 --> 22:17.474
Of course I know.

22:17.543 --> 22:19.043
You want spectacle.

22:19.111 --> 22:21.145
You want bloodshed.

22:21.213 --> 22:22.813
But I'm guessing

22:22.882 --> 22:25.783
that most of your
people don't know that.

22:25.851 --> 22:28.118
They know
what I want them to know.

22:28.187 --> 22:30.020
And I promise you

22:30.089 --> 22:31.989
you won't get what you want

22:32.058 --> 22:33.957
as long as those children

22:34.026 --> 22:35.159
are still
in the house.

22:35.227 --> 22:36.660
But if I release them?

22:36.729 --> 22:38.962
You're the hero
protecting your flock.

22:39.031 --> 22:40.464
They'll be more
willing to listen

22:40.533 --> 22:42.900
knowing that their
children are safe.

22:44.904 --> 22:48.372
I'm wondering why you're
being so supportive of my goals.

22:48.441 --> 22:50.707
I don't give a crap
about your goals.

22:50.776 --> 22:52.076
I have my own.

22:52.144 --> 22:54.578
But I'll agree with
you on one thing.

22:54.647 --> 22:58.215
Today is a day of reckoning,

22:58.284 --> 23:01.385
but not with the children
in the house.

23:01.454 --> 23:03.520
You're being honest.

23:03.589 --> 23:05.689
I like it.

23:05.758 --> 23:07.758
Tom?

23:07.827 --> 23:09.893
Gather the children.

23:18.437 --> 23:20.737
(birds singing)

23:22.775 --> 23:24.108
Okay.

23:24.176 --> 23:26.176
(exhales)

23:27.780 --> 23:29.079
Yeah.

23:29.148 --> 23:30.447
That's the kind of place

23:30.516 --> 23:32.116
my mother warned me
about going into.

23:32.184 --> 23:34.518
I promise there are no zombies
or mummies in there. Come on.

23:34.587 --> 23:37.454
Yeah, no, just, uh,
just rats, toxic chemicals,

23:37.523 --> 23:39.890
structural damage that
could lead to collapse...
Sebastian.

23:39.959 --> 23:41.225
You trying to freak me out?

23:41.293 --> 23:43.360
Actually, it calms me down
to talk out my fears.

23:43.429 --> 23:44.595
I'm so happy you're calm.

23:44.663 --> 23:46.563
Now, can we get in there
and save our boss, please?

23:46.632 --> 23:48.765
Ladies first.

23:50.136 --> 23:52.302
(clamoring)
Are you preparing
to enter the plantation?

23:52.371 --> 23:54.104
Look, we're not gonna
get into any details.

23:54.173 --> 23:55.439
Okay, all you need to know,

23:55.508 --> 23:57.141
what the people inside
need to know,

23:57.209 --> 23:58.976
is that we want
to keep everybody safe.

23:59.044 --> 24:00.878
In that vein, we're setting up
a new perimeter.

24:00.946 --> 24:02.913
We need all of you to move
toward the main road.

24:02.982 --> 24:05.449
(clamoring)
NEWSWOMAN: It's harder
to see the house from there.

24:05.518 --> 24:06.884
Y-You can't push us out.

24:06.952 --> 24:08.585
HANNAH:
But we're not.
We're doing our jobs.

24:08.654 --> 24:09.987
Okay? We're protecting you.

24:10.055 --> 24:11.188
Eddie's on the phone.

24:12.958 --> 24:14.258
All right.

24:14.326 --> 24:16.493
Let's get it moving.

24:20.065 --> 24:21.431
Eddie.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.300
I'm glad you reached out.

24:23.369 --> 24:25.235
In five minutes,
we're opening the front door.

24:26.505 --> 24:28.105
You're surrendering?

24:28.174 --> 24:29.473
I'm releasing the children.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.542
HANNAH:
All right.
Let's-let's talk about...

24:35.481 --> 24:38.649
People. Friends. Family.

24:38.717 --> 24:40.651
I know you're worried.

24:40.719 --> 24:42.119
You don't have to be.

24:42.188 --> 24:44.688
I know you don't want
the kids to leave,

24:44.757 --> 24:45.989
but it's best for us.

24:46.058 --> 24:47.524
And for them.

24:47.593 --> 24:49.860
It's gonna be okay,

24:49.929 --> 24:51.161
everyone.

24:51.230 --> 24:54.031
Eddie called the people
outside the gates.

24:54.099 --> 24:55.832
And Tom here,

24:55.901 --> 24:58.535
he's gonna take you
out to them.

24:59.738 --> 25:01.505
You got this.

25:01.574 --> 25:03.040
Yes, Dwayne, he gets it.

25:03.108 --> 25:05.375
I need you to come with me.

25:05.444 --> 25:07.511
(whispers indistinctly)

25:11.350 --> 25:12.482
We've got action.

25:12.551 --> 25:14.484
We move in clean and fast.

25:14.553 --> 25:16.520
Get them covered
as quickly as possible.

25:16.589 --> 25:18.722
And remember,
we're all on<i> Candid Camera</i> here.

25:18.791 --> 25:20.057
No mistakes.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.344
What's going on?

25:40.412 --> 25:42.479
Don't want to ruin the surprise.

25:50.789 --> 25:52.522
Gotcha.

25:52.591 --> 25:53.590
I'm Hannah.

25:53.659 --> 25:55.259
Let me get you out of here.
Come on.

26:00.132 --> 26:02.199
You're okay.

26:02.268 --> 26:05.769
You're okay. You're okay.

26:05.838 --> 26:07.571
You see?

26:07.640 --> 26:10.007
I'm a man of my word.

26:10.075 --> 26:11.675
Children are safe.

26:11.744 --> 26:14.378
Order has been restored.

26:14.446 --> 26:16.413
You did the right thing.

26:16.482 --> 26:19.783
Everyone down there
is breathing a sigh of relief.

26:21.253 --> 26:23.720
(indistinct chatter)

26:23.789 --> 26:26.323
Okay, light 'em up!

26:29.762 --> 26:30.927
What are you doing?

26:33.198 --> 26:34.831
Just bear witness!

26:46.846 --> 26:48.479
CARSON:
Take cover!

26:48.548 --> 26:50.214
Do not return fire!

26:55.688 --> 26:57.488
What the hell
are you doing, Eddie?

26:57.557 --> 26:59.690
Letting it all unfold.

27:01.694 --> 27:03.894
Okay, guys,
you've made your point.

27:14.373 --> 27:15.739
(panting)

27:18.511 --> 27:19.877
(siren wails)

27:22.915 --> 27:24.682
CARSON:
Shooting stopped

27:24.750 --> 27:26.350
for the moment,
but my spotters see movement

27:26.419 --> 27:27.618
on the second floor.

27:27.687 --> 27:28.853
They're going to start again.

27:28.921 --> 27:30.221
Okay. Are there any injuries?

27:30.289 --> 27:31.856
Two of my guys.
They'll pull through,

27:31.924 --> 27:33.624
but that's just
pure dumb luck.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.059
This situation
is out of hand.

27:35.127 --> 27:37.361
We're too exposed out
here. We need to breach.

27:37.430 --> 27:39.296
Tammy and Sebastian
are still in those tunnels.

27:39.365 --> 27:40.698
Let them look around,

27:40.766 --> 27:42.233
see if they can find
another way into the house.

27:42.301 --> 27:45.002
I don't think
we have time for that.

27:45.071 --> 27:47.838
TOM: I need
to speak to NCIS.

27:47.907 --> 27:49.707
Please, I need
to speak to NCIS.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

27:49.775 --> 27:51.208
Hey, what's going
on? What's going on?

27:51.277 --> 27:53.177
It's okay. Thank you.
What's going on?

27:53.246 --> 27:54.578
I can't leave.

27:54.647 --> 27:56.146
I'm here. Go ahead.

27:56.215 --> 27:58.148
(panting)

27:58.217 --> 28:01.185
Dwayne Pride
has a message for you.

28:01.254 --> 28:03.254
GREGORIO:
What do you mean,
the house is wired?

28:03.322 --> 28:04.855
HANNAH:
I'm not sure.

28:04.924 --> 28:07.191
Pride says the entire house
is set up for something.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.693
The wires disappear
under the floorboards.

28:09.762 --> 28:11.428
Well, that's not much
to go on.

28:11.497 --> 28:13.030
HANNAH:
Yeah, I know. I was hoping

28:13.099 --> 28:15.266
that you and Sebastian
could shed some light.

28:26.979 --> 28:29.046
Okay. We just got
under the house now.

28:29.115 --> 28:30.915
Well, move fast.

28:30.983 --> 28:32.449
FBI is preparing to breach.

28:35.488 --> 28:38.022
(whispers):
Let me see.

28:38.090 --> 28:39.723
What is all this?

28:39.792 --> 28:43.360
Ugh. Smells like fuel.

28:43.429 --> 28:44.862
It's probably some kind
of an accelerant.

28:46.599 --> 28:49.033
Eddie set the house
to go up in flames.

28:49.101 --> 28:52.403
Oh, God.

28:52.471 --> 28:55.139
(siren wails)

28:57.276 --> 28:59.910
This is the moment, Dwayne.

28:59.979 --> 29:02.446
I'm really pleased you're
still alive to witness it.

29:02.515 --> 29:05.749
Watch you fulfill your goal of
getting all these people killed?

29:05.818 --> 29:07.952
The reason you're so blind
is because you still define

29:08.020 --> 29:10.087
the world in
accomplishments.

29:10.156 --> 29:12.056
Goals.
Say whatever you want.

29:12.124 --> 29:13.624
There's about to be
a slaughter here.

29:13.693 --> 29:15.793
That's because you
and the people like you

29:15.861 --> 29:18.963
thought you could bring
order by taking me in.

29:26.238 --> 29:28.305
The federal agents
are coming for us,

29:28.374 --> 29:29.740
just like I told you they would.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.108
They want to silence us.

29:31.177 --> 29:32.643
We won't let them.

29:32.712 --> 29:36.347
We're going to face them
together as a family.

29:36.415 --> 29:37.514
It's our fate.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.616
You need to stop
lying to them.

29:39.685 --> 29:40.951
You've set them up to die.

29:41.020 --> 29:42.353
What's going on?

29:42.421 --> 29:44.688
He's just as blind
as the rest of them out there.

29:44.757 --> 29:46.256
Take a look out the window.

29:46.325 --> 29:48.359
You'll see what I see.
PRIDE:
The FBI

29:48.427 --> 29:51.295
is coming in here because he...

29:51.364 --> 29:53.497
he ordered his men
to shoot at them.

29:53.566 --> 29:55.432
But this can still
end peacefully.

29:55.501 --> 29:58.669
Eddie, you said that they
were free to go at any time.

29:58.738 --> 29:59.970
Can they all leave now?

30:00.039 --> 30:01.105
Enough!
(woman screams)

30:01.173 --> 30:03.874
Okay. That's how

30:03.943 --> 30:05.843
he really is. He's violent.
He's uncontrollable.

30:05.911 --> 30:08.712
If we stand together,
we'll find salvation.

30:08.781 --> 30:11.048
That's a lie.
You've already decided

30:11.117 --> 30:12.983
how this is gonna end.
Get rid of him.

30:13.052 --> 30:14.451
(grunts)

30:14.520 --> 30:16.620
Look at the wires.
All around you.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.722
Against the wall.
They're everywhere, look.

30:18.791 --> 30:20.057
The house is a kill box.

30:20.126 --> 30:21.525
There!
Now's the moment!

30:21.594 --> 30:23.527
Are you going to
believe his lies,

30:23.596 --> 30:25.229
or are you going
to stand with me?

30:25.297 --> 30:27.798
Tammy, FBI's moving in.
Please tell me

30:27.867 --> 30:30.034
that you found a way
to disable that accelerant.

30:30.102 --> 30:31.301
Sebastian's working on it now.

30:31.370 --> 30:32.736
Yeah, he's fully
aware of the urgency.

30:32.805 --> 30:34.505
Okay? It's kind of giving him
a panic attack.

30:34.573 --> 30:35.906
Don't panic, baby. You got this.

30:37.610 --> 30:38.976
(siren wails)

30:40.813 --> 30:42.146
AGENT:
This is the FBI.

30:42.214 --> 30:44.181
You have one more chance
to come out with your hands up.

30:45.084 --> 30:46.750
SEBASTIAN:
<i> Okay.</i>

30:46.819 --> 30:49.720
All right. All right. It's, uh,
some kind of a remote system.

30:49.789 --> 30:52.256
It's got a...
frequency detonator

30:52.324 --> 30:53.791
that's set off by a cell phone.

30:56.495 --> 30:57.828
All right, well,
if you know what that is,

30:57.897 --> 30:58.896
that means you can shut it down.

30:58.964 --> 30:59.963
It means I know what to try.

31:04.937 --> 31:06.804
Okay.

31:10.443 --> 31:12.109
(followers screaming)

31:14.613 --> 31:18.115
They're coming
to take away your freedom!

31:18.184 --> 31:20.417
Don't give in!

31:20.486 --> 31:22.052
PRIDE:

33:13.647 --> 33:16.482
Now this is the moment
we've both been waiting for.

33:16.550 --> 33:18.851
(panting)

33:18.919 --> 33:21.153
GREGORIO:
Are you sure Pride and Eddie
went into the tunnels?

33:21.222 --> 33:22.755
Yeah, there was an escape hatch.

33:22.823 --> 33:24.923
They couldn't have gotten far
without being seen.

33:24.992 --> 33:26.058
Whoa, look.

33:26.127 --> 33:27.893
SEBASTIAN:
This looks new.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.395
It just got excavated.

33:29.463 --> 33:30.696
Yeah, but where does it lead?

33:30.765 --> 33:32.564
My guess is north,
away from the river.

33:32.633 --> 33:33.899
HANNAH (over comms):
Okay.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.035
I'll have a team
come up and meet you.

33:36.103 --> 33:38.737
We got to find them
before Eddie hurts Pride.

33:39.907 --> 33:41.540
Yeah, or vice versa.

33:41.609 --> 33:44.276
Feels familiar, huh?

33:44.345 --> 33:47.413
Like we've played this moment
a thousand times before.

33:47.481 --> 33:49.014
On your knees.

33:49.083 --> 33:50.416
Hands behind your head.

33:50.484 --> 33:52.384
What about my gun?

33:52.453 --> 33:54.286
You want me to get rid of it?

33:54.355 --> 33:56.588
Or would you prefer
a different outcome?

33:56.657 --> 33:58.724
I'm bringing you in, Eddie.

33:58.793 --> 34:00.392
You're gonna face
the consequences

34:00.461 --> 34:01.693
for what you've done.

34:01.762 --> 34:04.129
On that point, we agree.

34:04.198 --> 34:06.598
We're all going
to face the consequences.

34:06.667 --> 34:09.435
