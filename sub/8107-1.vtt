don't cause fever.

Not on their own. But the ER didn't know
she was on MAO inhibitors,

10:00.643 --> 10:03.688

that's a nasty combo.

I don't have to convince anyone.

a psychiatrist, I'd know.

medical treatment.

Does the diary say
my daughter's taking these drugs?

11:25.478 --> 11:26.312
No, but medically...

11:26.437 --> 11:27.897
Did you find drugs
in their home?

11:28.022 --> 11:30.149

under a thousand tons of rubble.

11:33.319 --> 11:34.862

We were in a fight.

11:34.987 --> 11:35.946
It doesn't mean
she's depressed

11:36.072 --> 11:37.156
and it doesn't mean
she doesn't love me.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.033
Fine.
Maybe the diary proves nothing.

11:39.158 --> 11:42.411
On the other hand,
half the country's on anti-depressants

11:42.536 --> 11:45.164
and it fits
her symptoms perfectly.

means you make the decisions.

well enough anymore.

You were bouncing ideas
off a janitor.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.663
And solved the case!

13:53.876 --> 13:57.129
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.090
If you can hear what I'm saying,
blink once.

You've been in a terrible accident,

14:09.099 --> 14:11.685
but it looks like
you will have no permanent injuries.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.438
You've had a bad fever,
but it's gone now.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.774
I've been here the whole time, honey.
Okay? I'm not leaving.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.234
CUDDY: This is very important.

I need you
to blink one for yes, twice for no.

a psychiatrist?

We shocked her back into sinus rhythm,
but she's still tachycardic.

Fascinating. Equally fascinating is,
why are you here?

15:06.782 --> 15:08.784
I was gonna leave you alone
if you won the bet.

15:08.909 --> 15:09.827
But you lost.

which is all we were talking about.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.333
She confirmed
the anti-depressants.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.627
Go bet with someone else
if you wanna explain the heart problems.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.254

by winking.

Maybe there was a cute guy
across the room.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.758
She got better when I treated her.
Even I'm not that cute.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.011

Just a coincidence?

15:27.136 --> 15:28.470

at straws

you can't do this on your own.

15:30.723 --> 15:31.974
Fine.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.935
What explains the fever
and persistent tachycardia?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.521
It could be anything.
Endocarditis?

15:37.688 --> 15:39.440
No. Fever, no infection.

shouldn't give it back to you

Clever.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.471
Well, let's just say
your anti-depressant theory

16:52.596 --> 16:53.764
does explain the fever.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.350

And don't say a building fell on her.

Come on, it fits. Crushed musculature
releases potassium, causes V-tach.

it could be.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.594

are you testing her?

17:42.020 --> 17:43.313
The heart's fine.

her fever be back?

'cause you'll hit me.

in front of witnesses.

17:59.788 --> 18:00.789

18:00.914 --> 18:02.249
So, she's
an alcoholic now?

18:02.374 --> 18:05.210
Her first fever was from
the medication for her depression.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.336
Or you're wrong.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.715
The second fever was from
the self-medication for depression.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.716
This is insane.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.469
You don't think I would have noticed
her being constantly drunk?

18:13.594 --> 18:16.388
You were practically living with
Sylvia Plath. You didn't notice that.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.890
Tone it down
or I will hit you.

18:18.015 --> 18:19.850
Fine. I'll do
liver enzyme tests.

Liver enzymes can also be elevated
from musculoskeletal trauma.

a drinking problem or not.

in her pancreas.

25:40.874 --> 25:45.253
You fall in love. You get married.
50% chance it'll end in misery.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.130
Hiring employees
can be even tougher,

25:47.255 --> 25:49.841
because you know, eventually,
they're gonna leave.

25:49.966 --> 25:53.094
There's increased T2 signal
on her hepatic capsule,

25:53.220 --> 25:54.679
if you know what I mean.

25:56.223 --> 25:59.184
You got hurt.
Get over it.

26:02.354 --> 26:03.605
Now, if you'll excuse me,

26:03.730 --> 26:07.484
my patient's about to start bleeding
out of her mouth and anus.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.830
Internal bleeding.

26:21.414 --> 26:24.292
Not anymore.
Now it's all over the place.

26:24.417 --> 26:25.585
Why are you here?

26:26.586 --> 26:28.296
That's my patient
down there.

26:28.421 --> 26:29.839
You're here because I'm here.

26:32.592 --> 26:34.302
I am done enabling you.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.304
I know.

26:44.312 --> 26:47.232
The alcohol didn't cause the
pancreatitis, the internal bleeding did.

26:47.357 --> 26:48.858
The question is,
what caused the internal bleeding?

26:48.984 --> 26:49.985
I hate myself.

26:50.110 --> 26:52.028
You do know that the patient had
a building lying on her.

26:52.153 --> 26:52.988
Four days ago.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.406
Bleeding can start at any time.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.824
She's bleeding
from five different sites.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.701
Do you think they synchronized
their watches?

26:57.826 --> 26:59.661
She got Warfarin
after her hip surgery.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.163
It's designed
to mess with bleeding patterns.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.040
Fever, heart and bleeding.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.334
Three problems,
three completely different explanations.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.628
She must be the unluckiest woman
in the world.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.839
I only cling
to this crazy theory

27:10.964 --> 27:13.008
because it's been proven right
every step of the way.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.259
Each treatment worked.

27:14.384 --> 27:16.261
Yes. She looks
perfectly healthy.

27:16.386 --> 27:19.848
This much bleeding
is a symptom of something more.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.058
And you need a team,
because you're wrong

27:22.183 --> 27:23.810
and you're gonna
kill this woman.

27:31.067 --> 27:34.404
If I had a team,
this patient would be dead,

27:34.529 --> 27:36.323
because they'd be here
instead of me

27:36.448 --> 27:39.409
and they wouldn't notice the size
of this woman's uterus.

27:45.582 --> 27:49.336
Hi. How's it going?
Mind if I observe?

27:49.461 --> 27:52.922
Got a big room up top
with a big window just for that.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.299
Stop that.

27:55.425 --> 27:58.053
You wanna look at vaginae,
there are websites for that.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.804
You think
I'm made of money?

28:01.056 --> 28:02.807
Can you get him
out of here?

28:02.932 --> 28:07.395
Enlarged uterus means
that she was recently pregnant.

28:07.520 --> 28:11.483
She's a good liar, but I doubt she can
hide a baby from her boyfriend.

28:15.362 --> 28:19.074
Scraping in the uterus
indicates that she had an abortion,

28:19.199 --> 28:21.201
and nothing
in her medical history.

28:21.326 --> 28:22.786
Only one reason
to hide an abortion.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.579
Boyfriend wants babies,
she doesn't.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.663
She's bleeding everywhere.

28:25.789 --> 28:28.750
Unless the guy was performing
an abortion with a shotgun...

28:28.875 --> 28:30.210
<i>Stop enabling him.</i>

28:31.002 --> 28:33.129
It's not the abortion,
it's what she did after.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.881
The boyfriend would have
noticed condoms,

28:35.006 --> 28:37.217
he would notice abstinence.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.886
He would not notice the pill,

28:40.512 --> 28:43.807
which means
I don't need a team!

28:48.603 --> 28:52.023
Hey, where's your mother
in common law?

28:52.148 --> 28:54.859
Dr. House,
this is Doug McMurtry.

28:54.984 --> 28:57.320
His girlfriend
was working with Megan when...

28:58.446 --> 29:00.073
She's dead?

29:00.198 --> 29:01.449
She passed this morning.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.203
Well, then why
are you still here?

29:07.914 --> 29:10.333
I need the old lady's consent
to do some treatment.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.210
What'd you find out?

29:12.335 --> 29:15.547
I wish I could tell you,
but since you're not legally related...

29:15.672 --> 29:17.549
What the hell
did you find out?

29:20.885 --> 29:23.638
Your girlfriend
had an abortion.

29:25.598 --> 29:26.641
(GASPS)

29:26.766 --> 29:28.685
See why I didn't tell you?

29:30.145 --> 29:33.940
I'd be insane to also tell you
that she's on the pill.

29:34.858 --> 29:35.984
(EXHALES)

29:36.234 --> 29:37.527
No, she's not.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.112
If they'd known she was on it,

29:39.237 --> 29:42.157
they wouldn't have given her
a blood thinner after her hip surgery.

29:42.282 --> 29:44.367
The combination caused the bleeding.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.744
It's good news.
It's treatable.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.205
Just give her Tamoxifen,
which is normally a breast cancer...

29:49.330 --> 29:50.707
That's not true.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.877
We wanna have kids.

29:54.836 --> 29:55.837
Hmm.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.966
See, I already did
the blood tests.

30:00.091 --> 30:05.305
And either she lied to you,
or her blood lied to us.

30:11.436 --> 30:12.562
(SIGHS)

30:13.521 --> 30:16.399
Tell Megan I'm glad
she's gonna be okay.

30:25.033 --> 30:26.618
How're you doing?

30:27.619 --> 30:29.245
I got cancer.

30:29.370 --> 30:33.082
You're on an oncology ward.
Everybody's got cancer.

30:33.208 --> 30:34.292
You want sympathy,
you ought to try

30:34.417 --> 30:36.461
the hardly-anything-
wrong-with-me ward.

30:36.586 --> 30:39.589
In fact,
why don't I take you there right now?

30:39.714 --> 30:41.841
How sick are you?
Can you walk?

30:41.966 --> 30:42.926
Are you a doctor?

30:43.051 --> 30:46.221
Admitted today.
First day of a five-day chemo course.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.348
Yeah, you can walk.
Come on, let's go.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.266
Does Dr. Wilson
know you're here?

30:51.559 --> 30:54.604
Well, if he didn't,
this would be really stupid.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.564
'Cause then he wouldn't know
where his patient was.

30:56.689 --> 30:59.442
He might think
he'd been kidnapped.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.819
Now the room upstairs
is bigger, it's got cable,

31:01.945 --> 31:04.280
better-looking
sponge bath nurses.

31:04.405 --> 31:07.242
If you feel sick,
you call me directly, not Dr. Wilson.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.203
He's getting his last sat
of hormone shots.

31:10.328 --> 31:12.705
(PAGER BEEPING)

31:12.830 --> 31:16.125
(ALARMS BLARING)

31:19.587 --> 31:23.049
You put her on Tamoxifen?
An anticancer drug?

31:23.174 --> 31:24.592
It blocks estrogen receptors.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.804
Does it also block breathing,
and kidney function?

31:27.929 --> 31:29.722
She's crashing.

31:31.182 --> 31:33.560
Doesn't mean I was wrong.

31:36.104 --> 31:39.607
This is Dr. Marvin. We're bringing
this patient over now. Thanks.

31:39.732 --> 31:41.609
HOUSE: Anybody here a doctor?

31:44.279 --> 31:47.156
Kidney failure, spiking fever,
breathing difficulties.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.408
Any theories?

31:52.203 --> 31:54.414
Am I in an
M. Night Shyamalan movie?

31:55.498 --> 31:57.292
You're House, right?

31:58.793 --> 32:00.336
Okay, I assume you know me

32:00.461 --> 32:04.340
because I once insulted you,
your patient, or your relatives.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.843
If that's so, I apologize.
I was drunk that day.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.387
Patient initially presented
with crush injuries.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.556
I know you because Dr. Cuddy
issued a memo.

32:14.017 --> 32:16.978
Telling you
to cooperate fully with me?

32:17.103 --> 32:18.187
No.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.899
Figured that was
a long shot.

32:22.025 --> 32:24.319
Anybody here
not get that memo?

32:33.786 --> 32:35.371
Fungal infection.

32:37.081 --> 32:38.333
Don't you have a patient?

32:38.458 --> 32:40.543
She shot herself in the leg
while high on meth.

32:40.668 --> 32:42.920
Wouldn't hurt her
to be in pain for a little while.

32:43.046 --> 32:45.381
Fungal infection
would be in her eyes by now.

32:45.506 --> 32:46.382
Haemophilus?

32:46.507 --> 32:48.009
Doesn't explain the remitting fever.

32:49.052 --> 32:52.096
You've heard that I've got
a job opening, right?

32:52.221 --> 32:54.223
I just care about people.

32:54.349 --> 32:56.434
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

32:56.559 --> 32:59.354
ARDS doesn't explain anything,
except the breathing.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.397
If you care about people,
you're not getting the job.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.983
I was lying. Crush syndrome.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.987
Doesn't explain
the breathing.

33:08.112 --> 33:10.657
- What was the problem with ARDS?
- Only explained the breathing.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.700
- The crush syndrome?
- It didn't explain the breathing.

33:14.202 --> 33:15.453
Are you a fan of symmetry?

33:15.578 --> 33:17.497
- Sure.
- Weird.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.291
'Cause your eyes are lopsided,

33:20.416 --> 33:21.834
and by eyes I mean breasts.

33:25.254 --> 33:30.134
ARDS and crush syndrome,
both reactions to severe trauma.

33:30.259 --> 33:31.511
Why can't she have both?

33:31.636 --> 33:33.096
Because...

33:35.390 --> 33:38.142
Because then,
there's nothing we could do.

33:38.267 --> 33:39.435
(SNORTS SOFTLY)

33:40.478 --> 33:42.897
Boy, you remind me of someone.

33:43.731 --> 33:44.857
Send me your résumé.

33:44.982 --> 33:48.069
I'll put it on top of the pile
that I'm never gonna look at.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.037
I couldn't leave.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.792
You don't seem like the type of person
who would give up on giving up.

34:03.626 --> 34:05.044
I love her.

34:05.253 --> 34:06.421
You loved somebody.

34:06.546 --> 34:09.757
Somebody who didn't drink,
wanted to have babies

34:09.882 --> 34:11.134
and wasn't miserable.

34:11.259 --> 34:12.719
I know she lied, but...

34:12.844 --> 34:16.305
What are you doing?
Why are you saying these things to him?

34:17.724 --> 34:21.436
The woman you love doesn't exist.
This woman is dying.

34:22.395 --> 34:25.982
She has Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome and crush syndrome.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.775
Her body's basically giving up.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.988
We can keep her on supported dialysis
and hope for the best.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.788
Never mind.
She has a lump in her arm.

34:42.331 --> 34:43.833
Does that mean
you're wrong?

34:43.958 --> 34:46.794
Well, that'd be
good news for you guys.

34:46.919 --> 34:48.421
We'll know after a biopsy.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.803
Which patient is that?

34:57.221 --> 34:58.890
- Megan...
- House's patient.

34:59.015 --> 34:59.932
Yeah.

35:00.057 --> 35:02.018
- Didn't you get my memo?
- Sure.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.853
Got both memos.

35:04.437 --> 35:05.646
Both.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.901
And the second memo said
to ignore the first memo.

35:10.026 --> 35:12.403
Yeah, seemed odd.

35:13.237 --> 35:14.447
I did an MRI and...

35:14.572 --> 35:15.615
Of course you did.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.451
What'd you find?

35:18.576 --> 35:19.660
It's kind of freaky.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.370
She's got growths
all over the place.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.752
She's got tumors?

35:27.877 --> 35:29.170
Not exactly.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.673
The growths are
eosinophilic granulomas.

35:32.799 --> 35:36.135
They are usually
from allergic reactions,

35:36.260 --> 35:37.637
so I'm putting her on steroids.

35:37.762 --> 35:40.264
Allergy to what?
She doesn't have allergies.

35:41.098 --> 35:42.225
We don't know.

35:42.350 --> 35:44.602
Unfortunately, the only drug
she's had enough of

35:44.727 --> 35:46.771
to have this kind of reaction
is cephalosporin.

35:46.896 --> 35:48.272
And why is that unfortunate?

35:48.397 --> 35:50.817
'Cause she was on it two months ago.
That's what you mean, right?

35:50.942 --> 35:53.694
She took it for strep throat
so she can't be allergic to it.

35:53.820 --> 35:54.821
It would seem so.

35:54.946 --> 35:57.031
What is this hospital
doing to her?

35:57.156 --> 36:00.451
She has had
three separate medical disasters,

36:00.576 --> 36:04.497
and now she's dying of an allergy
she can't possibly have?

36:31.023 --> 36:33.109
Mr. Lee.
I just have to check...

36:35.027 --> 36:37.280
Sam? Are you okay?

36:44.453 --> 36:45.580
What are you doing here?

36:45.705 --> 36:46.914
I was taking a nap.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.583
Where's my patient?

36:51.961 --> 36:53.796
You stole my patient.

36:54.672 --> 36:56.132
You kidnapped my guitar.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.258
Give him back.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.968
Only when you give her back.

36:59.093 --> 37:00.469
It's a she?

37:00.595 --> 37:02.430
(SCOFFS)
It's certainly not a dude.

37:02.555 --> 37:05.349
It's a guitar.
You took a human being!

37:05.933 --> 37:07.727
Now who doesn't have
a sense of humor?

37:08.561 --> 37:10.563
I'm monitoring the guy remotely.

37:10.688 --> 37:13.608
What, are you listening
for the distant sound of screaming?

37:13.733 --> 37:15.026
The nurses know to call me.

37:15.151 --> 37:16.694
They don't know who he is!

37:16.819 --> 37:19.822
His name's right there on the chart.
Now go away. I'm working.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.825
They give him the wrong meds, who
the hell knows what's gonna happen?

37:25.411 --> 37:26.996
House!

37:29.957 --> 37:32.209
(SOFTLY)
Bad things would happen.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.964
He's in Room 318.

37:51.062 --> 37:53.272
What are you giving Megan?

37:53.397 --> 37:54.732
Megan? Nothing.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.694
Nothing? What's going on?
What's wrong with her?

37:58.819 --> 38:00.613
Her? Nothing.

38:00.738 --> 38:02.365
Then why are you giving her drugs?

38:02.490 --> 38:04.951
Just some amphetamines
to wake her up.

38:05.076 --> 38:08.704
Everything could be explained
by her lying to you.

38:09.163 --> 38:11.874
The anti-depressants,
the drinking, the pill,

38:12.750 --> 38:14.085
until now.

38:14.669 --> 38:18.172
Now she's allergic to something
the chart says she's not allergic to.

38:18.297 --> 38:23.302
That's not her lying, that's the chart
lying, which doesn't make sense.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.433
You know Liz Masters?

38:29.892 --> 38:32.019
- No.
- Yeah, she worked with Megan.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.313
That was her boyfriend
you met outside the morgue.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.648
Mmm.

38:36.524 --> 38:37.858
This is her chart.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.906
She's on MAO inhibitors for depression.
She's on the pill.

38:44.031 --> 38:46.283
She had an abortion a month ago,

38:46.409 --> 38:48.202
and she's allergic to cephalosporin.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.997
What's going on here?
What, are you saying this isn't Megan?

39:02.133 --> 39:03.050
Yes.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.927
Ben?

39:05.052 --> 39:06.303
<i>Since when?</i>

39:06.429 --> 39:08.681
Since right before
I began pretending I loved it.

39:08.806 --> 39:12.143
She's the same size as Megan,
the same build, the same hair color.

39:12.268 --> 39:15.104
<i>They were both
horribly injured, unrecognizably.</i>

39:15.229 --> 39:17.356
EMT teams do not second-guess

39:17.481 --> 39:20.276
family members' identifications
at accident scenes.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.694
(GASPS)

39:21.819 --> 39:24.572
No. Liz died yesterday.
This isn't Liz.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.577
I know Megan.

39:29.702 --> 39:35.082
I know her hair,
I know her hands, I know her smell.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.170
(RASPING)

39:39.295 --> 39:40.296
What's your name?

39:45.551 --> 39:46.886
(WHISPERING)
Liz.

39:48.888 --> 39:51.223
(sesame)
on, God!

39:58.939 --> 40:01.400
Your girlfriend never lied to you.

40:07.782 --> 40:09.408
(STILL SOBBING)
Oh, God.

40:54.912 --> 40:57.081
I did it
all by myself, Mommy.

40:58.916 --> 41:00.668
You talking to me?

41:02.169 --> 41:03.087
Go away.

41:08.843 --> 41:09.844
(DOOR OPENING)

41:12.054 --> 41:14.598
I did it all by myself, Mommy.

41:15.558 --> 41:16.851
How'd you know it was me?

41:16.976 --> 41:20.271
There's a scent given off
by wounded feral cats.

41:20.396 --> 41:22.148
You were wrong.

41:22.273 --> 41:25.401
I got everything right,
just treated the wrong...

41:25.526 --> 41:27.194
They had a good relationship.

41:27.319 --> 41:28.571
He couldn't even identify her.

41:28.696 --> 41:31.907
And you were wrong about needing
a team. She almost died.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.451
So, I almost need a team.

41:34.577 --> 41:37.997
You were content with
your "people are idiots" theory.

41:38.122 --> 41:39.915
But Cameron would
never have accepted

41:40.040 --> 41:42.376
that this guy knew nothing
about the love of his life.

41:43.586 --> 41:46.130
And as soon as you claimed
it was multiple conditions,

41:46.255 --> 41:48.632
Foreman would have done anything
to prove you wrong,

41:48.757 --> 41:51.260
and then Chase would have done anything
to prove you right.

41:52.303 --> 41:55.181
Any one of them
would have solved this days ago.

41:57.433 --> 41:58.684
Hire a team.

41:59.894 --> 42:01.979
I don't care how you do it.

42:03.564 --> 42:05.357
Just do it.

42:09.445 --> 42:11.739
<i>HOUSE: Sometimes I am wrong.</i>

42:13.365 --> 42:15.659
I have a gift for observation.

42:15.784 --> 42:16.952
(TUNING GUITAR STRINGS)

42:17.077 --> 42:21.373
For reading people and situations,
but sometimes I am wrong.

42:22.082 --> 42:25.211
This will be the longest
job interview of your life.

42:25.336 --> 42:27.171
I will test you in ways

42:27.296 --> 42:32.635
that you will often consider
unfair, demeaning and illegal.

42:32.760 --> 42:33.761
(TWANGS GUITAR)

42:33.886 --> 42:35.137
And you'll often be right.

42:35.930 --> 42:37.681
Look to your left.

42:38.891 --> 42:40.017
Now look to your right.

42:40.142 --> 42:41.310
(INHALES)

42:41.435 --> 42:43.437
By the end of six weeks,

42:44.438 --> 42:45.981
one of you will be gone,

42:47.233 --> 42:49.652
as will 28 more of you.

42:52.029 --> 42:53.364
Wear a cup.
