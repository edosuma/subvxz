MUSIC: Mandy
by Barry Manilow

00:03.360 --> 00:07.960
# Oh, Mandy, well, you came,
and you gave without taking

00:07.960 --> 00:12.440
# But I sent you away, oh, Mandy

00:12.440 --> 00:17.320
# Well, you kissed me
and stopped me from shaking

00:17.320 --> 00:21.880
# And I need you today, oh, Mandy. #

00:21.880 --> 00:24.680
So the job would be to assist
a sewer technician,

00:24.680 --> 00:26.680
also known as a flusher.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.720
Your job would be to be part
of the team responsible for clearing

00:29.720 --> 00:31.880
and cleaning the sewers of fatbergs,

00:31.880 --> 00:34.560
massive globs of congealed fat
and waste.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.200
Does that sound like something
you'd be interested in doing?

00:38.200 --> 00:40.120
Does it fuck.

00:40.120 --> 00:43.160
Er, you'd be working in the evenings
on a four-hour shift...

00:43.160 --> 00:44.600
What, just four hours?

00:44.600 --> 00:46.640
Well, yeah, you'd be working alone,
most of the time,

00:46.640 --> 00:47.880
just guarding the sewer.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.560
So they're saying this needs to be
someone who's able to stay occupied

00:50.560 --> 00:52.240
whilst on duty.Occupied?

00:52.240 --> 00:54.400
What does that mean?
What, just, like, stay awake?

00:54.400 --> 00:57.240
Yeah, that's the minimum
that's asked of you.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.960
They don't set a lot of hurdles for
people who want to work in sewage.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.440
Right, well, I'll take it.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.320
Well, hang on,
you need to meet the manager first,

01:03.320 --> 01:05.560
and then he'll decide
whether or not to take you on.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.920
Right, fine, well, book me in.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.560
OK, erm,

01:08.560 --> 01:11.760
you will wear something
more appropriate, won't you?

01:11.760 --> 01:13.680
What do you mean?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.240
Well, it's just very...

01:15.240 --> 01:17.920
Hey, eyes up, eyes up!
I'm not, I... Mm.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.800
I'm up here. Hello. I wasn't...

01:19.800 --> 01:22.160
You mucky devil!

01:22.160 --> 01:23.520
I have a good mind to report you.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.400
Others might come forward.

MUSIC: Di-Gue-Ding-Ding
by Michel Legrand

01:38.680 --> 01:40.160
Well, we've never had a woman

01:40.160 --> 01:42.360
who wanted to work down the sewers
before.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.200
Well, you've never met
Mandy Carter before.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.440
You know it stinks, right?

01:48.440 --> 01:49.920
What does?

01:49.920 --> 01:51.160
The sewer.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.760
Have you tried air fresheners?
Air fresheners?

01:53.760 --> 01:57.640
You'd need a scented candle
the size of Eccles

01:57.640 --> 01:59.760
to mask that stench.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.960
Well, it's fine by me.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.520
I don't have much of
a sense of smell anyway.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.560
All right.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.360
Do you know what this is?

02:08.360 --> 02:09.640
Is it a wet wipe?

02:09.640 --> 02:12.080
This, Mandy, is the sewer man's

02:12.080 --> 02:14.160
number one enemy!

02:18.920 --> 02:22.080
Ignorant people throw wet wipes
down the loo,

02:22.080 --> 02:27.120
where they combine with congealed
fat, cooking oil, food waste,

02:27.120 --> 02:29.920
condoms and excrement,

02:29.920 --> 02:31.840
to produce...

02:31.840 --> 02:33.560
..one of these -

02:33.560 --> 02:37.560
a fatberg, a mass so big

02:37.560 --> 02:39.880
that it blocks the entire sewer,

02:39.880 --> 02:42.080
causing a dangerous build-up

02:42.080 --> 02:45.840
of explosive methane gas.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.960
Now, you know, the facts,
are you still interested?

02:49.960 --> 02:51.680
It's only four hours a shift,
isn't it?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.280
Yes.Count me in.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.720
We tend not to ask too many
questions of anybody who wants to

02:55.720 --> 02:57.520
go down the sewers, but,

02:57.520 --> 02:59.400
just for the form,

02:59.400 --> 03:00.880
can you swim?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.480
Erm, no, no.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.200
Why would I need
to be able to swim?

03:05.200 --> 03:07.400
It's a pipe full of shit, love.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.600
You fall in,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.320
you can't swim,

03:10.320 --> 03:13.960
you drown in a pipe full of shit.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.200
You see him?

03:17.200 --> 03:19.000
Albert Pertwee.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.920
Fell in. Couldn't swim.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.920
Drowned in a pipe full of shit.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.760
You see him?

03:25.760 --> 03:28.160
Lance McFadden.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.040
He's dead.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.040
You know why?Did he,

03:32.040 --> 03:34.360
did he drown in a, in a,

03:34.360 --> 03:36.040
in a pipe... Pipe...

03:36.040 --> 03:37.880
..full of sh... ..full of shit.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.200
That's why we ask
for a swimming certificate.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.520
I like you, Mandy.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.960
I think you're a good egg.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.880
I'd like to have you down
my pipes

03:45.880 --> 03:47.800
but if you haven't got
a swimming certificate,

03:47.800 --> 03:49.640
no, can do. Them's the rules.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.360
Health and safety.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.400
Well, I could learn how to swim.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.040
Ooh-hoo hoo-hoo hoo!

03:55.040 --> 03:56.760
You're keen!

03:56.760 --> 03:59.840
You bring me that swimming
certificate within two weeks,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.280
and the job's yours.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.640
Oh! Fantastic!

04:04.520 --> 04:06.240
Why do you want to work in a sewer?

04:06.240 --> 04:07.840
It's only four hours a shift,

04:07.840 --> 04:09.640
no-one breathing down my neck,

04:09.640 --> 04:11.080
and who knows, Lola,

04:11.080 --> 04:13.280
might meet Mr Right down there.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.000
First, though, I've got to learn
how to swim.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.080
Oh, that's easy.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.400
Just go down to your local
swimming baths on a Wednesday,

04:18.400 --> 04:21.680
between two to three.
No-one is ever there at that time.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.800
Oh, right.
Yeah, I'll do that.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.720
What about technique, though?
Can you swim, Lol?

04:25.720 --> 04:28.440
Yes! I can swim like a fish.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.880
I was going to do the cross-Channel
swim to raise money

04:30.880 --> 04:32.720
for Comical Relief,

04:32.720 --> 04:34.920
but I swallowed a cap
on the training run

04:34.920 --> 04:36.760
and I had to miss it.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.320
Learn to swim, Mandy.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.720
It might save your life.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.400
What am I going to do
till Wednesday?

04:41.400 --> 04:45.480
I know. I'll go to the library,
get a book out and out to swim.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.920
Practise the theory.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.040
Vikings?

05:01.320 --> 05:02.360
Pigeons.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.680
I see we have the same interests.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.200
Eh? Vikings and pigeons.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.080
You what?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.360
Can I help you with anything?

05:13.360 --> 05:14.760
I'm looking for a book on swimming.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.440
There you go.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.600
Hope it helps.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.640
Ta.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.240
Ooh,

05:24.240 --> 05:25.520
just give that a wipe.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.640
I can't bear dirtiness.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.800
Muck.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.960
Thanks.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.160
Oh, erm,

05:32.160 --> 05:34.600
I was wondering if you'd like to

05:34.600 --> 05:36.640
come to a restaurant with me,

05:36.640 --> 05:38.200
sometime?

05:38.200 --> 05:39.520
Are you serious?

05:39.520 --> 05:41.200
Yeah.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.320
Me?

05:42.320 --> 05:43.640
Yes.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.080
Why?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.320
So that we can eat food

05:47.320 --> 05:49.640
and talk about

05:49.640 --> 05:51.560
pigeons, or Vikings.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.880
All right. Yeah.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.400
Erm, Monday at 6pm, Piccolino's?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.440
They've got a hygiene rating
of five.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.920
Ooh!

06:00.920 --> 06:02.400
Yeah, all right.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.760
Yeah, well, I'll, I'll,

06:03.760 --> 06:04.800
see you then.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.240
Oh, what's your name?

06:07.240 --> 06:08.440
Andrew.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.600
I'm Mandy.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.800
I know,
I looked it up on the system.

06:11.800 --> 06:12.840
Oh.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.880
I also saw that you owe us a fine,
as well.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.200
We never received
"Fifty Shades of Grey" back.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.200
It weren't for me.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.480
I were reading it
to a blind woman.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.240
Well, that's OK.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.120
I can just make that fine disappear.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.160
Thanks. See you.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.440
Lynne, I'm really not feeling
very well.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.080
I think I've got food poisoning.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.480
I might have to sit this one out.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.120
Oh, shit! Where's me costume?

09:18.400 --> 09:19.800
They don't give certificates now,

09:19.800 --> 09:21.320
as they're trying to cut down
on paper,

09:21.320 --> 09:22.760
but I have got this picture of me

09:22.760 --> 09:24.600
winning a synchronised
swimming gala.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.760
Will that do?

09:25.760 --> 09:27.760
That'll do it for me.Right.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.800
Here you are. Put these on.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.400
You can start tonight.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.440
KLAXON SOUNDS

09:34.440 --> 09:36.840
It's emergency! Emergency!

09:36.840 --> 09:38.720
Code red! Follow me!

09:38.720 --> 09:40.840
KLAXON CONTINUES

09:40.840 --> 09:42.880
Right, lads,

09:42.880 --> 09:46.680
what we've got is a super fatberg,

09:46.680 --> 09:48.760
17 metres across,

09:48.760 --> 09:53.240
causing a build-up
of combustible methane.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.560
When the sewage enters the tank,

09:55.560 --> 09:58.520
it will instantly overheat

09:58.520 --> 10:04.880
and vaporise approximately
7,000 cubic metres of effluent,

10:04.880 --> 10:10.560
giving rise to a significant
thermal explosion.

10:10.560 --> 10:16.040
Everything within a 30-kilometre
radius will be completely

10:16.040 --> 10:17.240
covered in shit.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.040
The release of effluent
will be severe.

10:22.040 --> 10:27.800
It will impact all of Clifton, Bury,
Prestwich and Stoneclough,

10:27.800 --> 10:31.920
Manchester, Salford, Trafford Park,
Stretford.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.240
Well, most of East Lancashire.

10:34.240 --> 10:40.920
Radcliffe will be completely
uninhabitable for 40 years.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.080
No change there, then.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.480
But, lads, I believe
we have a solution.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.960
We need three workers who know
the facility well enough

10:51.960 --> 10:56.640
to make their way through the
pertinent channels till they come

10:56.640 --> 11:02.240
to the sluice gate valve,
where they can pump out the tank.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.520
It is that simple.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.000
But let me warn you,
and I'll not mince words,

11:08.000 --> 11:13.120
whoever does it will likely
be dead within a week.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.440
Why would we do this?
For what?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.880
Why should you do it?

11:16.880 --> 11:19.840
Yeah. because it must be done.

11:19.840 --> 11:24.480
Lads, this is what is always
set our people apart.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.600
Hundreds of years of sacrifice
coursing through our veins,

11:29.600 --> 11:34.760
every generation must embrace
its suffering so you make your peace

11:34.760 --> 11:39.480
with it and go into the water
because it must be done!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.320
Frank Crickley.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.560
Trevor Hargreaves.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.080
Mandy Carter

11:53.440 --> 11:55.200
Sorry, what's going on?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.240
Didn't really understand
any of that.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.600
It's my first day.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.840
This, guard this with your life.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.040
This... This is your lifeline.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.960
This is your methane detector.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.720
Good lad.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.120
OVER RADIO: Mandy, are you there?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.480
Yeah, I'm here.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.520
What's your methane reading, Mandy?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.120
Er...

12:30.120 --> 12:31.840
My needle's in the red!

12:31.840 --> 12:34.000
This is worse than I thought.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.640
You're trapped in a giant methane
pocket and what you've got to do

12:38.640 --> 12:41.880
is make your way to the sluice
gates as quickly as you can

12:41.880 --> 12:43.360
and release the gas.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.200
My battery's dying!

13:01.120 --> 13:03.160
Hang on, I've got my fags here.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.520
I'll use my lighter. Mandy, no!

13:08.520 --> 13:09.840
The gas!

13:17.960 --> 13:20.000
EXPLOSION

13:20.000 --> 13:22.360
Good evening, sir.
Can I get you another drink?

13:22.360 --> 13:24.880
No, she should be here in a minute.
Thank you.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.000
OK, no worries.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.680
Oh, sorry, I'm late.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.440
Oh, God, you haven't got a wet wipe
on you, have you?

13:39.680 --> 13:42.080
I know they're bad for the
environment, but they're really

13:42.080 --> 13:44.120
handy, you know,
if you can't get to a sink.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.960
Oof.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.400
I am famished.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.960
What you having.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.680
Got meat loaf sliders.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.680
