What is your process?

11:54.339 --> 11:56.295
First, I shall take some photographs,

11:56.967 --> 11:59.504
they'll be useful as reference
when I get back to the studio.

11:59.595 --> 12:03.087
Then I shall do some charcoal sketches,
studies of the head, hands,

12:03.473 --> 12:05.634

-Perfectly all right. Carry on.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.995
Seated.

I could try standing.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.745
It might be more commanding, dynamic.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.336
It might make me look younger.

to celebrate reaching a certain age.

-Only some of the time.
-All the time.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.282
And that makes you terrifying.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.950
And she's heard a lot about you.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.413
-From whom?
-From me.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.328
Some of it nice, too.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.528
Oh...

-What?
-He's always carried a torch for you.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.757

that's when the truth comes out.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.519
No. That's when the nonsense comes out.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.348
Besides, we have interests in common.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.434
Horses aren't an interest to you.
They're a passion.

A passion your husband doesn't share.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.756

19:44.642 --> 19:47.554
There's ugliness in the air, Anthony.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.183
I have nothing of beauty to say.

19:50.273 --> 19:54.607
Then say what you must.
Deposit your ugliness and go.

19:55.362 --> 19:58.104
I have more important things to do.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.819
Very well.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.913
At some point,

20:09.793 --> 20:12.455
every leader must ask himself

20:12.545 --> 20:14.536
whether by staying in office,

20:15.090 --> 20:18.924
he is giving to the country or taking from it.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.961
Helping or harming.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.132
And I would suggest that, for some time now,

20:27.227 --> 20:31.061
you have been taking and harming.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.184
And therefore I come to you,

20:33.525 --> 20:35.982
in the name of the party and of the country,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.768
for the very last time, Winston,

20:40.448 --> 20:44.942
-to bid you to stand down.
-I will in good time. The right time.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.824
The right time was nine years ago
when you lost us the election.

20:48.915 --> 20:53.579
And I have since avenged that defeat
by winning us the last election.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.082
I won us that, Winston! I won that!

21:01.678 --> 21:05.136
People voted Conservative
in the clear expectation

21:05.390 --> 21:08.598
-that you would give way to me.
-That is such rubbish!

21:08.685 --> 21:12.644
They voted Conservative
because they couldn't stomach socialism!

21:12.730 --> 21:15.858
Inflation is out of control.

21:15.942 --> 21:21.062
And with every misjudgment,
with every miscalculation,

21:21.156 --> 21:23.067
with every utterance you make,

21:23.158 --> 21:25.865
that appetite to return to the left is growing!

21:25.952 --> 21:27.453
Be careful, Anthony,

21:27.537 --> 21:31.155
too much excitement is not good
for one so soon after an operation.

21:31.249 --> 21:35.162
Spoken by a man who
only two months ago was effectively dead.

21:35.253 --> 21:38.541
-Which makes two of us.
-I have recovered.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.292
That's not what I hear.

21:40.550 --> 21:44.088
I hear you are a shadow of your former self.

the pills rattle around inside of you!

that you will never see again.

-Drawing paper.

complete in a year, Mrs. Sutherland?

23:41.004 --> 23:42.915
-Over here.
-Three or four.

-Sixty.

Mr. Sutherland,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.554
after our last session.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.641
-Did you?
-Yeah. Quite interesting.

24:46.569 --> 24:50.733
From what I read, this is all very new to you,
this portraiture.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.156
I don't think anyone starts out
wanting to be a portraitist.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.198
Yeah.

24:55.286 --> 24:58.904
But in your search for your métier,
you've tried a bit of everything.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.076
That's true.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.791
I came to painting quite late.

25:03.878 --> 25:06.915
But now that you've found it,
you'll never leave it, yes?

25:07.131 --> 25:09.463

very little understanding of who they are.

But, yes, I know, it is infuriating. Fire away.

You asked me to come up with some figures
for you with regard to Aureole.

27:01.204 --> 27:03.946

Aureole has made you just over £40,000.

27:13.549 --> 27:14.709
Goodness.

27:14.801 --> 27:18.293

he could make you far more.

the need for concentration,

33:30.885 --> 33:32.375
It's very much more than that

33:32.469 --> 33:36.053

you've returned to it again and again.

Well, perhaps you elude yourself, sir.

than a self-portrait.

I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.

34:12.635 --> 34:15.251
The framing itself indicated to me

34:15.346 --> 34:18.964
that you wanted us to see something

34:19.642 --> 34:23.601
beneath all the muted colors,
deep down in the water.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.808
Terrible despair.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.520
Hiding like a leviathan, like a sea monster.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.690
You saw all that?

34:34.240 --> 34:35.605
Yes, I did.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.025
Perhaps that says more about you than me.

34:39.495 --> 34:40.484
Mmm-hmm.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.448
Perhaps.

34:46.210 --> 34:49.077
May I ask you a question, Mr. Sutherland?

34:49.338 --> 34:50.327
GRAHAM: Mmm.

34:50.673 --> 34:52.629
It's about one of your paintings.

34:52.967 --> 34:55.379
The one you call Pastoral.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.137
those great ugly dabs of black.

35:05.104 --> 35:10.269
I found something malevolent in it.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.065
Where did that come from?

35:13.487 --> 35:16.320
Well, that's very perceptive. That was...

35:16.532 --> 35:18.614
That was a very dark time. My...

35:20.327 --> 35:25.367
My son, John, passed away,
aged two months.

35:30.379 --> 35:33.371
Oh, my. I am sorry.

35:39.555 --> 35:40.965
Yes. Thank you.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.736
-You have five, yes?
-Four.

36:03.454 --> 36:05.786
Marigold was the fifth.

36:07.624 --> 36:12.744
She left us at age two years, nine months.
Septicemia.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.412
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

36:18.260 --> 36:19.249
Oh...

36:19.470 --> 36:26.342
We settled on the name Marigold
on account of her wonderful golden curls.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.719
The most extraordinary color.

36:31.732 --> 36:35.520
Regretfully, but though perhaps mercifully,

36:35.611 --> 36:39.103
I was not present when she died.

36:39.782 --> 36:42.774
When I came home, Clemmie

36:45.621 --> 36:48.033
roared like a wounded animal.

36:55.297 --> 37:01.213
We bought Chartwell
a year after Marigold died.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.303

37:08.310 --> 37:09.720

39:03.550 --> 39:05.927
I've called up three different mares.

My only concern would be,

39:26.114 --> 39:28.605
-is she perhaps a little too...
-Bashful?

39:29.284 --> 39:32.776
I'm worried that if we left these two to it,
nothing would ever happen.

the best with the best.

From memory, your Aureole
is something of a sensitive soul.

when we were courting.

55:06.137 --> 55:08.879
-Gently, gently, come on.
-Will you please be quiet?

55:10.516 --> 55:12.893
-Yeah, look. Here we go!
-All right.

55:14.061 --> 55:15.221
-MAN: You all right?
-(ELIZABETH SHUSHING)

55:17.398 --> 55:19.855
MAN 1: Hold her steady.
MAN 2: Steady.

55:19.942 --> 55:21.227
(GRUNTING)

55:21.402 --> 55:22.767
(LAUGHING)

55:25.239 --> 55:26.524
Stay.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.197
(HORSE CONTINUES GRUNTING)

55:32.121 --> 55:33.406
MAN 1: Back off.

55:34.540 --> 55:37.077
-Yes, there we go.
-MAN 2: Good girl.

55:37.793 --> 55:38.919
Good boy.

55:40.588 --> 55:41.748
PHILIP: IS that it?

55:44.300 --> 55:46.086
2,000 guineas for that?

55:46.427 --> 55:50.136
As long as he's done what he needs to do
and it bears fruit, I don't mind.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.380
Well done, Porchey!

55:53.768 --> 55:55.383
PHILIP: Yes, indeed.

55:55.937 --> 55:57.268
Well done, Porchey.

55:58.648 --> 56:00.764
I hear he's been given a direct line.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.356
-Who?
-PorChey.

56:02.443 --> 56:04.024
So he can call straight in.

56:04.111 --> 56:06.693
I know only because I tried to get one
for Mike and was refused.

56:07.573 --> 56:08.608
Yes.

56:09.408 --> 56:11.615
On account of him
not being a family member.

56:11.827 --> 56:14.409
-PorChey is like family.
-Is he?

56:14.956 --> 56:17.493
Yes. Part of the furniture.

56:19.627 --> 56:22.289
Well, as long as you don't sit on him
anytime soon.

56:26.634 --> 56:28.374
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

56:33.766 --> 56:36.803
-We||, that all seemed to go well.
-Yes, it did, didn't it?

56:39.105 --> 56:40.390
You all right?

56:43.025 --> 56:44.014
Mmm.

57:08.509 --> 57:11.421
-Can you leave us now, please?
-Yes, ma'am.

57:15.308 --> 57:16.548
(DOOR OPENS)

57:18.185 --> 57:19.174
(DOOR CLOSES)

57:27.987 --> 57:29.978
I have nothing to hide from you.

57:30.823 --> 57:32.063
Nothing.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.196
Porchey is a friend.

57:39.540 --> 57:42.748
And, yes, there are those
who would've preferred me to marry him.

57:43.419 --> 57:47.003
Indeed, marriage with him
might have been easier.

57:48.174 --> 57:50.381
Might have even worked better than ours.

57:53.721 --> 57:56.554
But to everyone's regret and frustration,

57:57.933 --> 58:00.891
the only person I have ever loved is you.

58:03.773 --> 58:08.016
And can you honestly look me in the eye
and say the same?

58:17.411 --> 58:18.696
Can you?

58:33.052 --> 58:34.758
WINSTON: Pray silence

58:34.970 --> 58:37.256
