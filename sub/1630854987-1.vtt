WEBVTT

00:41.959 --> 00:44.086
I'm gonna miss you.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.796
Wish I didn't have to go.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.383
I love you so much.

00:50.676 --> 00:53.679
Now you're gonna take your pills,
sweetheart, huh?

00:55.097 --> 00:57.891
All right? Don't just chew 'em up
and spit 'em out. [Chuckles]

00:58.892 --> 01:02.104
I can't believe you're traveling, mom.
I know how much you hate to fly.

01:02.229 --> 01:06.316
Yeah, I do, but some things are important.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.694
Thank you for letting me
leave him with you.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.697
- Of course. He's a cutie.
- [Both chuckle]

01:11.738 --> 01:13.532
Hey, kids! Come say hi to grandma!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.284
[Girl] I'm on the phone!

01:15.409 --> 01:17.828
So, um, the yellow pills are twice a day,

01:17.869 --> 01:19.538
- and the blue ones...
- I know, mom.

01:19.621 --> 01:20.998
You gave me the list, remember?

01:21.123 --> 01:22.541
Yeah, I know, but...

01:22.583 --> 01:24.710
And these are his toys.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.546
- And he sleeps with Mr. Moose.
- Hey!

01:27.588 --> 01:29.228
If you guys don't come in here right now,

01:29.256 --> 01:31.466
I'm gonna flush your phones
down the toilet!

01:31.550 --> 01:33.719
I don't wanna see them...
I mean, i-i'm...

01:33.844 --> 01:36.263
I don't wanna disturb them.
I know they're busy.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.474
And hey, don't you yell so much!

01:39.558 --> 01:41.435
I don't want you to stress him out.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.062
- Mom...
- He's already... freaked.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.480
[Footsteps approaching]

01:45.564 --> 01:47.149
I don't think he' stressed. He's fine.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.444
- Hi, grandma.
- Oh, hi, Tommy!

01:50.485 --> 01:52.362
So... who died?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.156
Oh, an old, old friend.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.950
Hey, maybe you'll play
with dashiell some time.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.747
Maybe.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.666
[Footsteps depart]

02:04.750 --> 02:06.585
Okay, um...

02:08.754 --> 02:11.298
If anything should happen,

02:11.340 --> 02:14.009
know that I love you, dashiell. Yeah.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.470
Mommy loves you
and you're gonna be taken care of.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.097
Okay, mom, stop being so dramatic.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.350
Okay? Flying is very safe.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.226
You'll be back before you know it.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.187
Nothing is gonna happen.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.367
[Birds chirping]

02:52.214 --> 02:53.799
[Indistinct chatter]

02:58.220 --> 02:59.221
[Allie] Claire!

02:59.262 --> 03:00.514
Allie.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.391
So glad you came.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.559
- Thanks for letting me know.
- Oh.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.062
Of course. Mom really missed you.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.397
She really loved you.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.816
I loved her.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.276
- Stop it! I can see you!
- [Indistinct noise]

03:13.402 --> 03:14.403
Three now.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.738
[Giggles] Three,
can you believe it? Stop it!

03:16.822 --> 03:20.534
Dad will be really glad you came.
It'll mean a lot to him.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.577
[Indistinct chatter]

03:25.122 --> 03:26.432
- Wonderful.
- [Woman chuckles]

03:26.456 --> 03:29.167
I'm wearing high heels in honor of Joyce.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.961
- Aww.
- She had such great legs,

03:31.002 --> 03:33.004
and she always loved to show them off.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.758
- She did! She had the best legs.
- [All chuckle]

03:36.842 --> 03:38.593
Claire! Oh, you made it!

03:38.719 --> 03:41.388
Oh, that would mean so much to her.

03:41.430 --> 03:44.182
This is Claire,
one of Joyce's oldest friends.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.393
They were at college together.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.396
[Raising voice] Claire lives in Ohio now.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.191
- We're so sorry for your loss.
- Oh, bless you, darling.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.026
Call us and come over to dinner, Howard.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.405
- Thank you, I will.
- [Woman] We love you.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.158
[Sighs] Claire.

04:01.283 --> 04:04.077
Howard... I'm gonna kill you.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.415
Now that she's gone,
now that it can't hurt her,

04:08.457 --> 04:09.624
I'm gonna kill you.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.629
This weekend.
I'm gonna do it this weekend.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.466
[Woman 2] Howard, oh!

04:17.591 --> 04:20.719
- Dear Howard! Oh, you dear man!
- Oh, hi. Hi, hi.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.013
I'm so, so sorry.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.641
You think you'll get used to it,

04:26.767 --> 04:29.102
used to the idea of loss.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.356
When you see it this far
over the horizon...

04:34.816 --> 04:38.361
It's like that shot
in Lawrence of Arabia,

04:38.487 --> 04:42.908
you know, the little speck
that gets closer and closer.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.952
[Light coughing]

04:49.498 --> 04:50.916
I learned a lot.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.503
I changed a lot.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.173
I learned Patience, humility.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.550
I learned...

05:00.675 --> 05:02.803
- To enjoy lattes.
- [All chuckling]

05:02.928 --> 05:08.517
Some of you know that Joyce
just loved her afternoon lattes,

05:08.558 --> 05:11.394
and she got me addicted
to them as well.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.525
Sometimes I... think
I can still hear her say...

05:16.650 --> 05:21.530
"Howie! Go to the cafe
and get some lattes, will ya?"

05:21.655 --> 05:23.031
[All laughing]

05:26.368 --> 05:27.828
[Sighs]

05:27.869 --> 05:30.163
I met Joyce in New York.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.584
We were married...

05:34.709 --> 05:37.420
[Sighs] Seven months after we'd met.

05:39.005 --> 05:43.009
And I have no regrets.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.222
None.

05:50.559 --> 05:55.188
Darling, I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...

05:55.272 --> 05:57.107
Is this the wrong entrance?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.067
Said "chapel" on the door.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.694
[Howard stammers]

06:00.735 --> 06:02.988
- Oh...
- Howard.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.282
- Did I interrupt your eulogy?
- [Mourners murmuring]

06:05.407 --> 06:08.076
- God, I'm sorry.
- That's all right, Evelyn.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.453
It's all right, please.
Everyone, this is Evelyn.

06:10.579 --> 06:15.083
Um... Evelyn was Joyce's
college roommate,

06:15.166 --> 06:17.711
- believe it or not.
- Why wouldn't they believe it?

06:17.752 --> 06:19.754
- That's just an expression.
- I was in the back,

06:19.838 --> 06:21.882
using the restroom. It's like a maze.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.301
- Understood. Yeah.
- A labyrinth.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.137
Nice photo.
A bit sanitized, maybe.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.015
- What?
- Well, she looks pleasant,

06:30.098 --> 06:33.852
but Joyce was never just pleasant.
She was always sparkly.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.897
"Sparkly"? Evelyn,
would you mind taking a seat?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.022
Would you mind, please?

06:38.064 --> 06:41.484
I'm in the middle of my eulogy to my wife.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.154
My wife of 51 years has just died!

06:44.237 --> 06:47.365
I understand. My friend just died.

06:47.490 --> 06:51.328
My friend of 60 years. How 'bout that?

06:51.453 --> 06:52.662
Isn't that something?

06:52.787 --> 06:53.872
[Howard sighs]

06:55.457 --> 06:58.877
Oh, go ahead.
You were saying something about...

06:58.960 --> 07:02.464
"No regrets," "darling Joyce,"
"bottom of my heart."

07:02.505 --> 07:04.883
[Howard sighs] Yes, I...

07:04.966 --> 07:07.886
- I was about to say...
- [Groans lightly]

07:07.969 --> 07:12.515
I admired her courage
in fighting this awful disease.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.019
[Pop music playing]

07:25.820 --> 07:28.114
Evelyn! Evie!

07:29.908 --> 07:31.785
It's-it's me, it's Claire.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.536
Hi, Claire. I know it's you.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.997
I haven't lost my marbles. Yet.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.708
- Or my eyesight.
- Get in.

07:38.833 --> 07:43.088
- Let me give you a ride.
- Do you have a driver's license?

07:43.171 --> 07:46.424
- I do. I took the test two months ago.
- [Scoffs]

07:46.549 --> 07:49.177
And you passed?
Did you bribe the instructor?

07:49.260 --> 07:52.681
I didn't have to!
I'm an excellent driver.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.016
- I trust the bus more.
- Oh, get in!

07:55.100 --> 07:56.434
I need to talk to you.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.854
About what? What do you need
to talk about?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.648
- [Car honking]

08:01.731 --> 08:03.984
- [Man] Come on, move it!
- God, hold your horses!

08:04.067 --> 08:06.736
What kind of person honks a horn
in a graveyard?

08:06.820 --> 08:10.031
Jeez! Pass, there's room. Go!

08:10.115 --> 08:12.742
- You jerk!
- Get in, Evie!

08:12.867 --> 08:15.745
I... I need to talk to you.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.622
I told him.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.749
You told him what?

08:19.833 --> 08:24.004
I told him I was gonna kill him
this weekend.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.588
I'm gonna kill the bastard.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.674
- [Birds chirping]
- [Sprinklers spraying]

08:29.426 --> 08:32.595
I could chat. A little bit.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.889
- [Claire coughs]
- You're not gonna kill anyone.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.351
- I am.
- You always had big ideas,

08:38.435 --> 08:40.645
but very little follow-through.

08:40.729 --> 08:41.730
Not true!

08:41.771 --> 08:44.458
Oh, what about the time you were gonna
go out in the middle of the night

08:44.482 --> 08:47.485
and paint a vagina
on that fraternity house?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.363
I don't remember that.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.115
You talked about it for weeks,

08:52.198 --> 08:55.910
you were gonna do it for homecoming.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.412
No kidding! What happened?

08:58.496 --> 09:01.249
Nothing! Nothing happened.
You never did it.

09:03.168 --> 09:07.630
Or what about the time you were gonna
become a lounge singer?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.382
Or drive down to Peru?

09:09.466 --> 09:13.428
- There's still time.
- [Groans, laughs]

09:13.511 --> 09:17.807
- Are you still playing?
- 'Course I'm still playing!

09:17.891 --> 09:21.436
Without my cello, I'd be lost,
completely lost!

09:21.519 --> 09:24.272
- Well, good for you!
- Mm.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.399
I'm not with the orchestra anymore.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.193
I'm with a couple of ensembles.

09:28.276 --> 09:33.239
One is devoted totally
to modern composers,

09:33.323 --> 09:36.076
and the other is all bach.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.328
Do-do you still have
that cute little house?

09:38.411 --> 09:42.290
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.376
Um, so I was wondering...

09:45.460 --> 09:48.004
If-if you could help me.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.839
What, murder him?

09:49.964 --> 09:52.842
There's a little thing called jail.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.387
Nice place to visit,
but you wouldn't want to live there.

09:56.471 --> 10:00.350
And let's take a moment to remember
our beautiful, kind, happy friend

10:00.433 --> 10:02.060
whose funeral we attended today.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.853
I've thought about her.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.232
I prioritized her happiness over mine,

10:07.315 --> 10:09.567
over my-my sanity.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.737
She never asked you to do anything.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.824
And I told you,
I told you to go the police.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.993
Yeah, you did.
They wouldn't have believed me.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.203
I mean, back then?

10:22.539 --> 10:24.666
"Why were you alone in that house?

10:24.749 --> 10:27.168
You knew your friend was out of town."

10:28.253 --> 10:30.505
"Why were you alone
in your best friend's house

10:30.588 --> 10:32.132
with her husband?"

10:32.215 --> 10:35.552
Mm. "Best friend." I thought
I was your best friend at that time.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.012
You were both my best friends!

10:38.054 --> 10:40.098
I'm just yankin' your chain.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.059
It would've ruined her life
if! Had told the police.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.895
We'll never know.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.981
Her life might've been better.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.196
What's the plan?

10:55.280 --> 10:58.032
I'm gonna shoot him.
I'm gonna buy a gun

10:58.116 --> 11:00.493
and I'm gonna take it to the wake.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.163
- Mm-hmm.
- You wanna come with me?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.917
Sure, scarface. Sounds like fun.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.378
[Chuckles]

11:18.386 --> 11:19.220
Oh!

11:19.304 --> 11:20.972
- [Door closes]
- Uh, hello.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.808
- Hello.
- I-I'd like to buy a handgun.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.728
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, something not to heavy, please.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.439
- And maybe a silencer.
- Hm.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.524
Well, I can't sell you a silencer.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.860
You can't legally buy
a suppressor in California.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.403
- Tsk.
- Oh.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.905
You can wear earplugs.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.741
Well, what kind of firearm
would you recommend for me?

11:39.824 --> 11:42.285
I want something that's... light.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.912
Well, what're you gonna use it for?

11:43.995 --> 11:46.080
Tell 'im.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.957
Sport shooting? Self defense?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.167
Yea... self defense.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.420
Okay, well, how about
this little Davis derringer? [Sighs]

11:52.503 --> 11:53.671
Fits right in your pocket,

11:53.796 --> 11:55.516
or your pocketbook,
right next to your keys.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.842
- Oh, it's cute!
- Very!

11:57.926 --> 12:01.471
.22 caliber, two shots.
Nice backup piece.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.056
- [Gun clicks]
- Wanna hold it?

12:03.139 --> 12:06.643
- Oh, sure!
- It's used, costs about $125.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.853
- It's light!
- How's the recoil?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.939
- [Seller clears throat]
- Recoil?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.359
Um, not gonna lie, it has a little kick.
Not much there to absorb the shock.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.526
[Gun clicking]

12:15.610 --> 12:17.987
Do you have arthritis
in your wrists and hands?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.782
A little bit in my-in my left wrist.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.618
But I take medication.
Hips are my problem.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.536
Mine too! I got
a hip replacement last year.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.330
Oh, how'd that go for you?

12:27.413 --> 12:30.959
Pretty good, thanks.
I also recommend this beretta 92.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.543
[Gun clicking]

12:33.544 --> 12:34.671
Looks heavier.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.799
It has very little recoil.
Very smooth, feels like a Cadillac.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.050
[Chamber clicks]

12:39.133 --> 12:41.970
I think that the key here is
to use a load that lessens the kick.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.682
These .9mm bullets are very lightweight.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
Hollow point for maximum damage.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.187
Oh, maximum damage sounds neat.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.273
Yeah, I'll take... I'll take
the smaller gun.

12:53.356 --> 12:57.193
Um, okay. I'll need your California
driver'slicense or your Cal ID,

12:57.277 --> 13:00.113
and you can take the handgun safety test
right here in the store.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.490
I don't have a California license.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.201
- You don't have California license?
- No, I live in Ohio.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.163
[Scoffs] Then I can't
sell you a gun. Sorry.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.625
Well, darn it! We tried.

13:12.709 --> 13:13.751
[Door opens]

13:18.006 --> 13:20.174
So, did you get that out of your system?

13:21.676 --> 13:24.387
The whole dirty Harry,
death wishthing?

13:24.470 --> 13:27.098
No, I didn't get it out of my system!

13:27.181 --> 13:29.559
- God!
- [Distant siren wailing]

13:29.642 --> 13:31.936
I should've bought
a gun at home and brought it.

13:32.020 --> 13:36.149
[Scoffs] Couldn't have gotten it
on the plane.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.986
Oh, Claire, it's been decades,
and not like a couple of decades,

13:40.028 --> 13:43.031
it's been four and a half decades!

13:43.114 --> 13:46.034
[Emotional] It was yesterday.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.702
Yeah.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.412
Oh, I remember.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.623
The necklace Joyce was wearing
in the photo, at the funeral home?

13:52.707 --> 13:54.459
I gave her that necklace.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.003
- I had one too.
- Do you have any poison?

13:58.087 --> 14:01.966
I have a cyanide pill in case I'm captured
by the enemy. You can have it.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.802
I'm just gonna have to stab him
in the stomach.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.763
- [Laughs]
- Are you going to the wake?

14:06.888 --> 14:10.350
No. I'll read about it
in the newspaper tomorrow.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.727
I have a rehearsal.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.020
You hate him too!

14:14.103 --> 14:17.357
I don't hate anybody, it's too exhausting.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.027
Well, let me give you
a-a ride to your house.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.946
I think I'd rather take the bus.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.991
Evie... Evie...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.201
[Scoffs]

14:31.496 --> 14:34.123
You're the only person I ever told.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.334
Jesus! Really?

14:40.338 --> 14:42.673
Well... except for a therapist.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.678
I had a therapist
after my second divorce.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.390
Clearly it's done wonders for you.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.393
Evie... come with me.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.770

Um... how's your grandfather? How's Walt?

He wants to teach me how to throw a ball
and shoot a gun.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.239
Oh, does he have one?

17:53.281 --> 17:54.991
He has a baseball.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.411
But does he have a, uh, gun?

17:58.536 --> 17:59.536
Yeah.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.249
- He has a gun. [Chuckles]
- I think so.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.544
He showed it to me.
He says he wants to teach me.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.545
Huh.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.008
Can we do that other thing
we did last time?

you don't mind that I'm here.

I know dad and I do.

- Um, I have a few words to say.
- Please.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.689
Uh, this is Evelyn,
one of my mother's oldest friends.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.069
Joyce was a wonderful woman.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.237
- [Kids chattering]
- She certainly was.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.989
[Evelyn] A great cook.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.075
A devoted wife and mother.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.035
A doting grandmother.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.411
[Murmurs of appreciation]

26:19.495 --> 26:22.456
And forjunior
and senior years in college,

26:22.539 --> 26:27.002
and then six months in New York City
after graduation,

26:27.086 --> 26:29.671
she was my roommate and my lover.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.964
[Mourners gasp]

26:31.006 --> 26:33.509
Jesus, what?

26:33.634 --> 26:36.970
And this wasn't
a "gay until graduation" type of thing.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.014
This was who she was.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.684
But not who she wanted to be.

26:43.936 --> 26:47.022
[Howard laughs, wheezily]

26:47.106 --> 26:49.233
God! [Laughing]

26:49.316 --> 26:51.193
I'm sorry, Howard. What's so funny?

26:51.276 --> 26:56.198
You are, Evelyn. You always had
such a great sense of humor.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.075
Mm, not really.

26:58.158 --> 27:02.871
People think I'm being funny,
but I'm really just talking.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.749
It's very inappropriate,
Evelyn, and untrue.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.293
And not something my children
needed to hear.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.003
Oh, was it?

27:10.087 --> 27:12.589
Did you even understand
what I was saying, honey?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.341
You said you loved grandma.

27:14.424 --> 27:18.011
[Gasps] That's right!
That's exactly what I said.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.431
Adorable grandkids.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.767
She got that in the transaction, I guess.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.894
[Howard] She told me.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.438
She told me that you were delusional,

27:28.522 --> 27:31.525
that you were infatuated with her.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.319
I mean, we used to laugh about it.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.991
She thought you were funny.
I can tell you that.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.076
She told me you were cruel.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.788
My father is one
of the kindest people I know.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.291
Oh, is he?

27:47.374 --> 27:49.084
[Allie] I think you should leave now.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.004
I tend to agree.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.465
Howard, you didn't deserve her.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.347
Um, can anyone give me a ride?

28:07.019 --> 28:10.480
So? What did you think of my big news?

28:11.857 --> 28:12.858
I knew.

28:12.941 --> 28:16.445
Two of you were always staring
at each other,

28:16.528 --> 28:18.155
mooning over each other.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.949
So why didn't you say something?

28:20.991 --> 28:23.368
Why didn't you?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.454
Joyce didn't want to.

28:27.748 --> 28:30.125
Guess I didn't either at the time.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.171
- It was a different time.
- No.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.925
You have always underestimated me.

28:38.008 --> 28:41.011
Here, pull over. Here, at the bus stop.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.933
What gives? I can drive you home.

28:46.016 --> 28:48.018
What're you afraid of?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.364
[Announcement over pa indistinct]

29:01.365 --> 29:02.532
[Evelyn] Hey.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.626
Ta-da!

29:14.378 --> 29:15.378
[Evelyn sighs]

29:17.172 --> 29:20.092
Why... why did you lie to me?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.594
Why-why did you say
you still had your house?

29:22.678 --> 29:25.847
Well, if you thought I still had my house,

29:25.931 --> 29:29.017
then for a moment there
it was as if I still had my house.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.062
Yeah, makes sense.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.522
Not really.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.984
It just got too much to keep up.

29:37.025 --> 29:40.904
I-I spent a fortune on plumbing,
the roof...

29:42.239 --> 29:44.116
I didn't have the money anymore.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.910
- I love these chairs!
- Aren't they good?

29:46.994 --> 29:50.580
But didn't you get a great pension
from the orchestra?

29:50.664 --> 29:53.917
Well, I have a modest pension.

29:54.001 --> 29:56.044
Enough to pay for this place.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.338
I'm in the independent living section,

29:58.422 --> 30:01.550
- so I come and go as I want.
- Right.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.845
For rehearsals and concerts and...

30:04.928 --> 30:07.514
Oh, yeah. [Chuckles]

30:10.600 --> 30:11.768
Sorry.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.980
Arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.983
My ankles are in good shape, though.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.445
I still teach, from time to time.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.281
I do a master class, occasionally.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.284
One of my old students
teaches nearby,

30:27.326 --> 30:31.288
she has me come in,
critique the sawing.

30:32.289 --> 30:35.000
- Oh.
- She throws me a few bucks.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.503
And the meals are included here.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.965
I like eating cardboard,
so it's worked out for me.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.676
- [Chuckles]
- I can invite a guest.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.970
Wanna come to dinner?

30:47.012 --> 30:50.182
Well, you-you make it sound
so appetizing...

30:51.892 --> 30:54.144
Uh, no, but Ralph invited me to diner.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.772
Damn, you work fast!

30:56.897 --> 30:57.897
[Light chuckle]

30:59.691 --> 31:00.942
Look!

31:01.943 --> 31:04.071
Look at us!

31:04.154 --> 31:05.155
[Claire gasps]

31:08.325 --> 31:10.535
Look at us...

31:17.918 --> 31:19.836
- [Crickets chirping]
- [Distant barking]

31:31.264 --> 31:32.349
[Exhales]

31:40.816 --> 31:43.819
[Soft music playing on stereo]

31:47.114 --> 31:49.157
You were married to grandpa?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.992
Yes, I was.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.872
It's not polite to stare.

31:55.997 --> 31:59.376
- Well, you can't blame him.
- [Chuckles] That's true.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.503
- I'd stare.
- [Joie chuckles]

32:01.586 --> 32:04.089
This was before grammy?

32:04.131 --> 32:05.882
Of course it was before grammy,
knucklehead.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.802
- What do you think?
- Don't call him names. Say you're sorry.

32:09.886 --> 32:10.762
Sorry.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.681
Now tell him something nice about him.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.683
[Sighs] You're good at roblox.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.766
Now you tell your brother
something nice about him.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.520
You smell funny.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.105
[Claire and Ralph laughing]

32:20.188 --> 32:22.399
That wasn't nice. Do another one.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.402
- Uh... you're fast.
- [Ralph] Yes, he is.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.446
- I am fast.
- Very fast.

32:32.993 --> 32:37.289
It was a long, long time ago
when your grandfather and I were together.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.458
[Chuckling] Prehistoric times.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.126
- [Claire laughs]
- [Grandkid 2] Okay.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.295
How long are you in town for?

32:43.420 --> 32:47.132
Just for the weekend, the funeral.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.302
This is so good!

32:50.427 --> 32:51.803
- You're a good cook, Ralph.
- Mm.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.889
Well, I remembered you were pescatarian.

32:55.182 --> 32:56.433
Still am!

32:56.475 --> 32:57.309
[Both chuckle]

32:57.434 --> 32:58.634
[Grandkid 1] Can I be excused?

32:58.727 --> 33:01.730
- Me too, I'm full.
- What about dessert?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.024
Can I take an ice cream sandwich upstairs?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.233
You finish that salmon.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.486
I can't, I'm full.

33:07.611 --> 33:10.238
Okay, well, the garbage can
will finish it.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.324
- That's me.
- [Chuckling] Oh!

33:12.449 --> 33:14.910
I eat anything they leave.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.620
[Claire] Oh...

33:16.661 --> 33:18.955
[Joie] If you both take
your plates into the kitchen,

33:19.039 --> 33:21.833
wash them off and then put them
in the dishwasher...

33:22.834 --> 33:25.086
Then you can take
an ice cream sandwich upstairs.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.090
- [Ralph] There you go.
- [Grandkid 2] Thank you.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.548
- [Ralph] Mm-hmm.
- [Chair drags]

33:32.052 --> 33:35.055
- Good kids.
- Thank you.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.848
They are a pain in the butt.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.225
[Chuckles]

33:38.350 --> 33:40.769
It's nice that your father
has you here with him.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.938
- It certainly is.
- Yeah!

33:42.979 --> 33:45.482
Well, it's good for us,
because he's such a good cook.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.651
Yeah. [Chuckles]

33:50.862 --> 33:52.572
I think I'm gonna excuse myself as well.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.700
- It was very nice to meet you, Claire.
- You too, joie.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.295
Um... care to have an after dinner drink?

34:08.380 --> 34:09.589
Okay.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.012
Claire, there's, uh...

34:16.096 --> 34:19.808
There's something
I've always wanted to ask.

34:19.849 --> 34:20.976
Oh, god...

34:22.143 --> 34:23.395
What happened?

34:24.813 --> 34:26.106
Now, don't get me wrong.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.567
This is the best thing
that could've happened to me,

34:28.692 --> 34:30.569
I-I moved on with my life.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.406
[Scoffs] I met zora,

34:34.531 --> 34:36.533
I have kids, I have grandkids...

34:38.618 --> 34:40.870
[Sighs] But I've always wondered.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.915
Heh. So I'm gonna have
to sing for my supper, huh?

34:43.999 --> 34:46.001
- [Chuckling]
- Oh, no, no, no.

34:46.126 --> 34:49.462
You don't have to unless
you would like to.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.426
[Ralph sighs]

34:55.594 --> 34:57.721
You know, it would be nice
after all this time

34:57.846 --> 35:00.181
to have one less mystery in my life.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.310
Did you meet someone?

35:04.561 --> 35:06.146
- Meet someone?
- A man.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.747
Did you fall in love with someone else?

35:07.856 --> 35:10.150
No, no.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.319
Well, that's a relief.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.070
- [Claire chuckles]
- I guess.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.282
I mean, I thought maybe...

35:17.324 --> 35:19.284
If-if I was to be honest,

35:19.326 --> 35:21.911
I thought perhaps it was the old story.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.288
What old story?

35:23.330 --> 35:25.665
That I'm black and you're white.

35:26.791 --> 35:30.170
[Laughs] And what,
and I just suddenly realized that?

35:30.295 --> 35:33.381
[Chuckles] Maybe your father got to you.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.760
- Oh, Ralph!
- [Glass taps table]

35:38.887 --> 35:40.347
I loved you.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.477
I loved you, Ralph.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.485
And then?

35:57.906 --> 35:59.616
Something happened.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.660
- Something happened?
- Yeah.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.119
- Something bad?
- Yeah.

36:07.207 --> 36:10.960
- And you couldn't tell me?
- [Emotional] I couldn't.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.797
I couldn't, I couldn't.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.965
It made me mute.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.927
I made me... deaf. It made me...

36:19.928 --> 36:24.808
It made me blind to you
and to everything good in my life.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.439
[Sniffs]

36:32.565 --> 36:34.526
I just... couldn't.

36:34.651 --> 36:35.819
[Sniffing]

36:37.404 --> 36:39.864
Claire, Claire, Claire, i-i...

36:42.701 --> 36:45.829
- I don't understand this.
- [Quietly] I know.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.288
[Sighs]

36:52.168 --> 36:53.878
But I'm sorry.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.887
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you, Ralph.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.107
[Sighs]

37:57.192 --> 37:58.234
[Grunts]

37:59.819 --> 38:01.112
Not funny.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.331
Walter.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.917
- [Click]
- Walter.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.543
- [Groaning]
- Walt!

38:15.668 --> 38:17.003
What? Who is it?

38:17.086 --> 38:19.756
- It's Evelyn.
- You're not the nurse.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.759
No, I'm Evelyn, from the lunch room.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.344
- Oh...
- Don't get up.

38:24.385 --> 38:27.555
- [Chuckling] I couldn't if I tried to.
- Oh...

38:27.680 --> 38:29.808
What are you doing
at this time of the night?

38:29.933 --> 38:32.560
Do you have a gun? Do you?

38:32.685 --> 38:35.104
You're not allowed to have a gun in here.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.690
I imagine not, but do you?

38:37.774 --> 38:40.568
- Who told you I have a gun?
- Your grandkid.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.403
My grandson?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.823
Well, maybe, time will tell,
but let's not get into that.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.491
Where is your gun?

38:46.533 --> 38:49.118
- You leave my gun alone.
- {Gasps}

38:49.202 --> 38:51.788
- here, in this closet?
- Don't open that closet.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.414
If you do, I'm calling the nurse.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.543
Okay, all right, all right.
Just relax, Walt.

38:57.544 --> 39:03.550
Please, I would like
to borrow your gun, Walter.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.009
What for?

39:05.051 --> 39:07.804
Well, there... there's these thugs.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.848
They're threatening my friend.

39:09.889 --> 39:12.225
She lives in a rough neighborhood.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.686
But if I show them this gun,

39:14.727 --> 39:17.605
just kind of waved it around
and said, "hey!

39:17.730 --> 39:22.110
You leave my friend alone,
you misogynist creep!"

39:23.111 --> 39:24.612
Then they'd leave her alone.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.740
- That sounds harebrained.
- I suppose,

39:27.866 --> 39:30.451
but it's the god's honest truth.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.745
Will you do this for me, Walter?

52:50.834 --> 52:53.921
Apologize for what?
Threatening to kill me?

52:53.962 --> 52:57.800
Uh, yeah. For that.

52:57.925 --> 53:00.969
All right, well, apology accepted.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.222
I just... I feel...

53:06.392 --> 53:08.560
Crazy, I've been just crazy, Howard.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.020
[Mouthing] Woman... woman...

53:10.104 --> 53:11.855
A crazy woman, you know, I...

53:11.980 --> 53:14.042
- [Whispering] Stress! Stress!
- It must be the stress.

53:14.066 --> 53:16.068
I've been under a lot of stress.

53:16.151 --> 53:18.404
You know, because of the traveling?

53:18.445 --> 53:20.739
- [Screams]
- Oh, Jesus! Wow!

53:20.823 --> 53:21.699
[Mutters]

53:21.740 --> 53:24.743
[Whispering] I wanna make friends.
I wanna make friends.

53:24.827 --> 53:27.037
- I hate to...
- [Evelyn whispering]

53:27.121 --> 53:30.749
I hate... I hate to think
that I came all this way...

53:32.376 --> 53:35.170
And-and to have that be the last...

53:35.295 --> 53:37.756
Time that-that, you know,
that I saw you.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.718
And so I think
I should come over and apologize

53:40.843 --> 53:43.429
before I go home. And...

53:43.554 --> 53:47.558
Somehow I feel that Joyce
wouldn't want it to end like this.

53:49.017 --> 53:52.396
[Groans] Well, look, I'm going to the park
with Allie and the kids.

53:52.438 --> 53:55.858
I... I suppose you could meet us there.

53:55.899 --> 53:58.193
Perfect. Uh, where?

54:00.279 --> 54:03.198
[Carrousel music playing]

54:18.005 --> 54:19.798
Should-should I load the gun now?

54:19.882 --> 54:24.470
I wouldn't. You don't want it
going off in your bag by accident.

54:24.595 --> 54:29.099
So, what? I just take it out and load it
right there, in front of him?

54:29.183 --> 54:31.018
[Scoffs] I guess.

54:33.353 --> 54:36.356
Look, you don't have to prove
anything to me.

54:36.482 --> 54:38.192
I already know you're ioca.

54:38.317 --> 54:40.986
No, you were right.

54:41.069 --> 54:42.446
I... oh, my god!

54:42.488 --> 54:47.034
There are so may things that I have not
ever followed through on.

54:47.117 --> 54:50.037
My dad used to call me "I.L."

54:51.038 --> 54:53.123
Short for "little loser."

54:53.207 --> 54:56.251
- [Dry chuckle]
- How crummy.

54:56.376 --> 55:00.088
I remember him,
in his uniform, at graduation.

55:00.172 --> 55:03.342
So you'll keep Allie
and the kids occupied?

55:06.970 --> 55:08.347
[Birds chirping]

55:10.682 --> 55:12.518
There they are.

55:41.004 --> 55:44.299
Oh, Christ! She's got
that awful dyke with her.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.844
Dad! Don't talk like that.

55:46.969 --> 55:50.889
Well, it's unconscionable
what she said at your mother's wake!

55:51.014 --> 55:54.518
Anyway, it's not even
a bad word, is it? Dyke?

55:54.560 --> 55:57.104
It is when you say it, so don't say it.

56:01.108 --> 56:03.277
You know, I think I'll go talk to Claire.

56:03.402 --> 56:05.112
I refuse to speak to Evelyn.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.905
- [Children chattering]
- Oh! God damn.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.747
Hello, Howard.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.917
A word of advice...

56:19.001 --> 56:20.752
Hello, Claire.

56:22.754 --> 56:25.007
I'm glad you called.
We're old friends.

56:25.090 --> 56:28.302
I wouldn't want there to be
any bad blood between us.

56:28.427 --> 56:29.595
Yes.

56:30.888 --> 56:33.765
Should we sit down and talk?

56:33.849 --> 56:35.642
Yes, just for a moment.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.939
- Hi, Evelyn.
- Hi, there.

56:41.023 --> 56:42.024
[Chuckles]

56:42.107 --> 56:44.359
Bet you didn't think
you'd be seeing me again!

56:44.484 --> 56:46.486
It's a surprise.

56:46.570 --> 56:50.782
I supposed I should, what? Apologize?

56:50.866 --> 56:54.119
Um, I've actually been thinking
about it a lot,

56:54.202 --> 56:55.954
and I think maybe I should?

56:56.038 --> 56:57.789
Guys, come here right now.

56:57.873 --> 57:00.250
- [Kids squealing]
- What's that little one's name?

57:00.334 --> 57:03.462
- Joyce.
- Joyce, that's nice.

57:03.503 --> 57:05.148
[Cal] Are we gonna ride
the carrousel or not?

57:05.172 --> 57:06.798
Yeah, just go line up by the gate.

57:06.924 --> 57:08.008
[Kids laughing]

57:11.261 --> 57:14.473
When I said you were lying...
I knew you weren't lying.

57:15.474 --> 57:18.185
I found some letters
when I went through my mom's stuff.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.228
My dad couldn't do it, he was a wreck.

57:20.312 --> 57:22.689
So I went through my mom's whole office,

57:22.773 --> 57:25.525
and she kept some of the letters
you wrote her.

57:26.610 --> 57:29.112
She did? Love letters?

57:29.196 --> 57:33.325
They were very... frank and explicit.

57:33.408 --> 57:35.118
Holy cow. [Chuckles]

57:35.202 --> 57:38.705
She kept the letters all these years?

57:38.789 --> 57:41.541
Hot dog! [Laughs] I'm tickled.

57:41.667 --> 57:44.252
- [Laughs]

57:44.336 --> 57:46.421
We have an extra ticket. You wanna get on?

57:46.546 --> 57:48.423
I'd love to.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.133
Look, Claire...

57:51.635 --> 57:52.928
I understand.

57:54.012 --> 57:57.182
I understand guilt,
[Stammers] It's a horrible emotion.

57:57.265 --> 57:59.184
It distorts everything.

57:59.267 --> 58:02.729
- Guilt?
- Yes, I understand your guilt.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.356
I felt it too, for many years.

58:04.439 --> 58:05.649
My guilt for what?

58:05.732 --> 58:07.317
What happened.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.323
Our transgression.

58:14.533 --> 58:17.828
Don't worry, she never knew about it.
I-I never told her.

58:17.869 --> 58:22.040
Huh, even when I was getting sober,
when I was making amends,

58:22.124 --> 58:24.876
I didn't tell her. No reason to it.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.378
Would've caused too much pain.

58:26.461 --> 58:29.089
- You made amends?
- I did.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.675
I called the people in my life,

58:31.758 --> 58:34.136
the ones I felt that I'd wronged...

58:35.846 --> 58:37.264
It was very healing.

58:37.347 --> 58:40.392
It changed me, you know,
the whole process.

58:42.769 --> 58:43.770
[Howard chuckles]

58:43.895 --> 58:45.897
Would you mind sitting with her?

58:45.981 --> 58:48.400
- With joycie? Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

58:51.653 --> 58:52.863
May |?

58:54.281 --> 58:57.492
- I get dizzy on the horses.
- Yeah, me too.

58:59.119 --> 59:01.413
What, are you looking for tissues?

59:01.496 --> 59:03.623
- [Canister clanks]
- Oh! Oh! Oopsie! [Grunts]

59:03.707 --> 59:05.000
You dropped this.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.461
You know, I really better be
getting back to the grandkids.

59:07.586 --> 59:10.714
I mean, oh, god! The energy!

59:11.757 --> 59:14.217
What's that? The heck is that?

59:14.301 --> 59:16.303
- [Flare gun clicking]
- Is that a toy?

59:17.596 --> 59:20.098
No. It's a flare gun.

59:20.182 --> 59:21.516
What, for emergencies?

59:26.605 --> 59:28.273
I want you to tell the truth.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.985
I want you to say it.

59:33.361 --> 59:36.490
I want you to say what happened.

59:36.615 --> 59:37.824
What happened?

59:39.826 --> 59:41.286
[Whispering] What happened?

59:41.369 --> 59:44.164
- We had sex!
- [Scoffs]

59:44.247 --> 59:46.249
Yeah! It may have been a bit rough,

59:46.333 --> 59:50.045
but we had sex one drunken night.

59:50.128 --> 59:52.047
Now I wish it'd never happened,

59:52.130 --> 59:54.341
but I never meant to betray Joyce,

59:54.424 --> 59:56.235
and I'm sure you didn't want
to hurt your friend.

59:56.259 --> 59:57.636
That wasn't sex!

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.138
All right, stop pointing that.
I'm not joking now.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:01.223
Sit down.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.409
Don't tell me what to do.
Now I've had enough of this!

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.644
Sit down or I'm gonna shoot you.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.312
[Laughs] You'll shoot me?

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:11.399
- What, with a flare gun?
- I'll burn a hole in you! I'll do it.

01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:15.237
Listen, you're delusional.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.322
I don't know what you think happened
between us...

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.657
Yes, you do.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.660
I think you're suffering
from dementia, that's what I think.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:25.747
I think you blame me for what happened
to your own marriage to Ralph.

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:28.125
I think you gave him a terrible time of
it,

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:30.544
because I think
you're that kind of person.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:34.881
You're one of those people
who are never satisfied,

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:38.301
one of those women
who are not built for happiness.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.887
- Stop lying!
- [Muttering] You want the truth?

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:43.223
- Stop lying!
- [Yelling] You want the truth?!

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.892
- Yes!
- I'll give you the fucking truth!

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.312
I'm shocked.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:53.775
I am shocked by your utter selfishness!

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:57.195
[Emotional] I just lost
the love of my life.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:01:01.366
[Yelling] She was everything,
everything to me!

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:04.703
I've had my heart ripped out!

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.372
And you have the nerve to come here,

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:11.418
to come here
with your fucking gun and you...

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:14.087
[Grunts]

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.633
Oh... oh... oh...

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:22.470
[Groaning]

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.432
- [Grunting]
- Ho-Howard...

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.058
[Grunting]

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.978
- Howard!
- [Gasping]

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.188
Howard!

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.609
Uh... help!

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:42.073
H-Help! Someone's...
Had-had a heart attack!

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.326
- [Kids laughing]
- [Maeve] Giddyap!

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.994
Giddyap! Giddyap!

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:50.040
You think your sister knows
it's not a real horse?

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:54.294
Hey, come on! Come on!

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:55.837
[Carrousel music playing]

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.214
[Claire sighs]

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.303
- [Shooting flare]
- [Hissing]

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.981
Oh, my god!

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.025
[Man speaking over pa distantly]

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:24.241
Did you save grandpa's life?
Mom said you saved grandpa's life.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:27.994
[Scoffs] Yes. Apparently.

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:29.996
Oh, we don't know that.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.582
He can still take a turn for the worse.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.174
You wanna know something amusing?

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:45.011
Joyce kept my love letters.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:48.181
- That's amusing.
- Isn't it?

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.600
- Allie told me.
- Tsk.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:53.687
I mean, I'm tickled.
After all those years!

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.692
I wonder if Allie threw them all out.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:04.239
So, did your grandmother
ever talk about me?

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.657
About Evelyn?

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.494
Um... I... don't know.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.247
It's okay. I'm just wondering.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.332
[Footsteps approaching]

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.459
He's doing okay.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:19.170
Thank goodness you brought
that flare with you!

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:20.547
Why did you have that thing?

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:23.717
Oh, she always carries one.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:26.344
You'd be surprised
what she fits into that bag.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:28.179
Was it a-a heart attack?

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.223
No, they don't think
it was a heart attack.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:33.601
They think it could've been
an anxiety attack, possibly an ulcer.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:36.896
They don't know. They're keeping him
overnight to make sure.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.566
So he's not gonna die?

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:43.278
Well, they're still running tests,
but they think he's out of danger now.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.407
They say it's really good
that he came in.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.492
He's been under a tremendous
amount of stress.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:51.411
Oh, stress is a killer.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.330
A slow one, evidently.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.333
You think I could see him?

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.293
Oh, I think so. I think
he'd like to see you,

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:01.463
but they just gave him a sedative,
so he might be sleeping.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:03.923
- Yeah. What room?
- 814.

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:07.218
Claire...

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:11.222
[Allie] I'm starving.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:14.017
I think I'm gonna run the kids down
for a snack and come back up.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.894
Can I stay? I'm not hungry.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:18.021
No, you can come down with us.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:20.315
But I'm in the middle of a game.
I'm trying for a record.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.194
Can you just keep an eye on him?

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:25.653
Sure.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:29.991
And can you not mention
anything about...

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:33.411
Anything sapphic? Sure, no sweat.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.081
We'll be right back. Come on, girls.

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:09.697

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:11.533
Nurse!

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:19.541
Joyce was away
visiting her mother, who was sick.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:24.087
And she asked me if I wouldn't mind
dropping food off for you.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.423
She said that...

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:30.218
You couldn't be relied on
to feed yourself.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:34.681
And she was worried about you.
She said you'd been drinking a lot.

01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:36.724
[Scoffs]

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:38.601
It was a mistake.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:42.105
Whatever happened between us...

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:45.024
- It was a mistake.
- It was a mistake?

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:51.531
That you grabbed my breasts so hard,
they hurt for a week?

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:55.702
That you put your leg behind my leg
and tripped me down to the floor,

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.413
and then lay on top of me...

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:02.208
And pulled out your penis...

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.629
Put your hands on my throat,

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.799
and said if I screamed,
you'd choke me?

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:14.137
[Voice breaking] Then you pressed
my face into the floor,

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.141
[sniffling] And you pulled up my skirt
and you shoved it in me?

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:25.023
I would never force myself on anyone.
I would never do that.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.610
- You wanted it.
- {Gasps}

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.321
you were always looking at me.

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.657
I would catch you... staring.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:38.870
[Harrumphs] You had troubles
in your own marriage.

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.371
You just don't remember.

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:44.459
Oh, come on! It was 45 years ago.

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:47.754
[Firmly] It was 46 years ago.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:59.349
What was that room number again, 814?

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.479
Don't talk to any strangers.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.073
Oh, shit!

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.868

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:30.964

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:41.224
How dare you?!
How dare you stop me?!

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.978
I couldn't let you. I don't want you
to spend the rest of your life in jail.

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:47.230
Maybe that's what I want!

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.857
Maybe I'd rather be in jail,
knowing he's dead!

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.235
Maybe you want to go to jail,
maybe you still will.

01:07:52.277 --> 01:07:53.903
Attempted murder is a crime too.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.406
Oh, he's not gonna say anything!

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.576
He knows it's true.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.704
[Crying] He knows it's true!

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:06.457

I don't know what he wants.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.007
Oh, you know what he wants.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:18.011
You think I'm getting any action nowadays?

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:21.139
All I have is a cello
I can't play anymore!

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:24.309
An option on a room in-in assisted living

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.604
once I can't keep up my room
in independent living.

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.564
You know what you have?

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.859
You did what you wanted in life.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.652
- That's what you have.
- [Elevator beeps]

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.988
- [Elevator doors open]
- Get in.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.578
I'll take the bus.

might like a glass of vodka.

I don't drink.

- How about a joint?
- No.

Appreciate you coming.

Well, the last time we talked,

you called me
"a narrow-minded philistine."

We don't come to have someone
play dress-up with him.

I imagine not,
but if James wants to play dress-up,

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:51.636
what's the harm in that?

I'd make you some damn cookies,
I'd buy you a sweater,

I'd tell you every day
just how perfect you are.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:12.966
You'd be a terrific grandmother!

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.409

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.390
- So how's your hip?
- My hip's fine.

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.266
So it's just your arm?

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.520
Yes, it's just my arm that seems broken.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:45.982
I guess that's lucky.
I mean, for your hip.

How long has it been
since you had a license?

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.998
Um... eight years.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.625
We should've let that family drive us.

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:07.294

No, the doctor said
you couldn't have caffeine.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:19.765
We can get you a decaf.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:23.227
Oh, I'll be damned if I drink decaf!
It defeats the purpose.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.955
Well, you're gonna have to get used to it,

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.779
'cause that's all I'm gonna have
in the house.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:30.401
I hope you're not gonna be ordering me
around all the time in Philadelphia,

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:33.738
because if you are,
I don't think I'm moving in.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:37.700
It's all right.

What did you bring me?

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:43.706
The letters.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:47.251
Your love letters to Joyce.
They weren't thrown away.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:49.003
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.338
I went to the house
and I got them from Allie.

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:53.924
Claire, you did that for me?

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.510
Well, I thought you'd want them.

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.013
That was very thoughtful of you.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:04.143
It occurs to me,
I could've had the biltmore arms

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:07.104
- call you an ambulance.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:12.818
[Light grunting] Oh, that was
the emergency entrance!

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.987
Well, were we allowed to use that?

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:17.615
I mean, is this an emergency?

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:18.991
I guess not to you.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.659
Well, should I turn back?

Look, I won't be long.
There's a cafe in the lobby.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.399
And it won't be a goddamn decaf!

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:53.567
Dad!

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.658
- Where the hell do I park?
- There's a place up ahead.

But I guess they're both
in a better place now.

Not sure about both of them.

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:06.075

Nothing romantic at all,
just-just lunch.

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:22.484
Why nothing romantic?

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:24.653
What if I wanted to get romantic?

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:27.990
- Is that an issue?
- Not with me. [Chuckles]

01:20:28.032 --> 01:20:29.033
Okay.

But I have to give you a raincheck.
I'm gonna have lunch with my friend.
