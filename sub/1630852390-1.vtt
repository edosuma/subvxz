WEBVTT

00:52.965 --> 00:54.706
Why aren't there any toys?

00:55.838 --> 00:57.666
I don't know, honey.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.276
Let's come back tomorrow
and check, okay?

01:20.950 --> 01:22.473
This is
absolutely ridiculous.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.387
I'm sorry,
I don't have you on here.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.519
It's very frustrating.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.868
There's really nothing
that I can do.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.565
I know! You've said that
about five times already.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.046
Mr. McKenzie, Holly Silver.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.092
Publicist at Arthur Publishing.

01:32.135 --> 01:35.182
Huge fan. I absolutely loved
your last book.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.879
- As I was saying,

01:36.922 --> 01:39.229
we don't have Mr. McKenzie
on the show this morning.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.926
This is what I've been
dealing with since I got here.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.493
No, of course, you have him.

01:42.537 --> 01:44.234
This has been lined up
for weeks.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.541
Your producer, um...

01:48.543 --> 01:50.240
Mike Stanton.
He should be expecting us.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.894
I don't know who that is.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.896
You don't know
the producers on your show?

01:53.939 --> 01:55.158
I know all the producers here.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
We don't have a Mike Stanton.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.857
I've never been
treated like this before.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.337
Mike will clear this all up.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.034
I don't think he can.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.776
Thank you,
Mr. Unsolicited Advice,

02:04.820 --> 02:06.996
but he absolutely can.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.215
Just trying to help you.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.042
You seem
a little confused, is all.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.132
The only thing
I'm confused about

02:12.175 --> 02:14.569
is who you are
and how this concerns you.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.311
Well, that's Jack Kane,
Major League Baseball all-star.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.399
Ah.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.227
Him, we do have
on our schedule.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.403
Well, still,
we should talk to Mike.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.666
That's not gonna help.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.450
Really? And why is that?

02:26.494 --> 02:28.496
Probably because Mike Stanton

02:28.539 --> 02:31.063
works at
"Good Morning, Bay City."

02:31.107 --> 02:34.241
and we are at
"Wake Up, Bay City."

02:36.591 --> 02:39.637
Came to the wrong place.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.638
- Uh...

02:43.511 --> 02:44.816
- Ah...

02:46.992 --> 02:49.517
Really? Uh, well...

02:51.127 --> 02:55.044
It's safe to say that there has
been some kind of a mix-up,

02:55.087 --> 03:00.092
but still, Mr. McKenzie
has eight best-sellers.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.790
I just wrote
the seminal Christmas novel.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.748
Great.
Another Christmas novel.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.446
You think there are
too many Christmas novels?

03:05.489 --> 03:07.883
I think
there's too many Christmas...

03:07.926 --> 03:09.319
everything.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.148
This is who my client
is getting bumped for

03:12.192 --> 03:14.019
on your "lead up
to Christmas" special?

03:14.063 --> 03:16.021
Your client isn't
being bumped for anyone.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.154
He was never scheduled.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.330
Ah. That's a fair point.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.766
You know what?
She's right.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.333
I am the wrong person
for this spot,

03:23.377 --> 03:24.378
and I would gladly

03:24.421 --> 03:26.249
give up my spot
to Mr. McKenzie.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.729
Big fan.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.470
Probably not gonna get
to the Christmas book, though.

03:29.513 --> 03:30.384
Great! We'll take it.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.124
No, I-- I can't.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.822
Please, Mr. Kane, follow me.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.000
Here. In case
you need directions

03:38.043 --> 03:40.872
to "Good Morning, Bay City"
or anything else.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.222
Thanks. I'm good.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.267
Good luck avoiding Christmas

03:44.311 --> 03:45.573
on a Christmas special.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.056
Mr. McKenzie,
we will fix this.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.281
"Jack Kane."

03:59.848 --> 04:01.415
Gil.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.374
Yes. Oh, he is upset.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.637
Yeah. I will be right over.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.378
- No.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.293
You're certainly more important
than a baseball player, Andrew.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.599
<i>We're here with</i>

04:11.642 --> 04:13.165
<i>Major League Baseball all-star
Jack Kane,</i>

04:13.209 --> 04:14.428
<i>talking about
his charity foundation,</i>

04:14.471 --> 04:15.559
<i>"Food for Families."</i>

04:15.603 --> 04:16.430
I don't understand
how she could...

04:16.473 --> 04:17.996
<i>...shut down operations</i>

04:18.040 --> 04:20.042
<i>when the company managing
your funds went bankrupt.</i>

04:20.085 --> 04:22.697
<i>No, no. I-It's complicated.</i>

04:22.740 --> 04:24.394
<i>How complicated can it be?</i>

04:24.438 --> 04:28.703
<i>While we were not the one
who lost this year's funds,</i>

04:28.746 --> 04:30.531
<i>I take responsibility,</i>

04:30.574 --> 04:32.663
<i>and I would like
to wholeheartedly apologize</i>

04:32.707 --> 04:35.013
<i>to all the families
who were affected by this.</i>

04:35.057 --> 04:37.451
<i>Thank you for
setting the record straight.</i>

04:37.494 --> 04:39.366
<i>Now, how about you fill us in</i>

04:39.409 --> 04:41.933
<i>on all your exciting
holiday plans?</i>

04:41.977 --> 04:44.980
<i>Well, I wouldn't call
staying home alone exciting.</i>

04:45.023 --> 04:46.286
<i>You have no plans
for Christmas?</i>

04:46.329 --> 04:49.724
<i>No plans are my plans,
as always.</i>

04:49.767 --> 04:51.856
<i>You never do anything
for Christmas?</i>

04:51.900 --> 04:54.337
<i>-No.
- I can't believe it.</i>

04:54.381 --> 04:57.645
<i>Jack Kane is going to be
home alone for Christmas.</i>

04:57.688 --> 04:59.211
<i>I have a dog.</i>

04:59.255 --> 05:02.824
Now, there's a man
who needs a good PR manager.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.913
Do you want to call him
and ask him if he has one?

05:04.956 --> 05:06.915
No! Andrew.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.134
Your time is very valuable
to us.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.919
In fact...

05:10.962 --> 05:13.356
I'm gonna make sure that Holly
never makes this mistake again.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.271
- What?
- My apologies.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.534
Yes.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.014
Okay. Goodbye.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.364
What are we gonna do
about this?

05:21.408 --> 05:22.496
You could start

05:22.539 --> 05:24.019
by calling him back
and telling him

05:24.062 --> 05:25.107
that you made the booking

05:25.150 --> 05:27.327
and gave me
the wrong information.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.460
I don't see
how that will help.

05:31.853 --> 05:34.508
O-Okay. No. You're right.
You're right.

05:34.551 --> 05:37.119
But first, we have to find
a way to make Andrew happy.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.555
Uh...

05:38.599 --> 05:39.687
a gift basket?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.515
Gil...

05:41.558 --> 05:43.517
this can't keep happening.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.432
Holly,

05:45.475 --> 05:47.999
here at Arthur Publishing,
we're a team,

05:48.043 --> 05:50.959
and a rising tide
raises all boats.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.353
It's not important
who gets the blame for what.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.442
What's important is,
we move forward.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.880
Focus on... what matters.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.403
Sarah. Yeah.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.797
<i>Hi, Gil.
Yes, I heard what happened.</i>

06:02.840 --> 06:05.190
<i>Apparently,
we can take care of it, but...</i>

06:05.234 --> 06:07.323
You know what, Gil?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.890
- You're right.
- I know.

06:08.933 --> 06:13.242
It is time for me to focus
on what really matters,

06:13.285 --> 06:15.636
which is why
I'm giving you my notice.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.246
Great. I'm glad we--

06:17.289 --> 06:18.813
Wait! What?

06:20.075 --> 06:21.946
It's been wonderful
working here,

06:21.990 --> 06:24.427
and I've learned some important
lessons from you, Gil,

06:24.471 --> 06:26.516
but it's the holidays,

06:26.560 --> 06:29.563
and there might be more
important things for me to do.

06:29.606 --> 06:30.607
Holly! Think about
what you're doing.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.130
Merry Christmas, Gil.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.262
No.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.438
No. No, wait.
Is there anything I--

06:35.482 --> 06:36.918
Holly.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.442
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

06:39.486 --> 06:40.791
<i>Gil, are you there?</i>

06:42.053 --> 06:43.054
<i>Gil!</i>

06:43.098 --> 06:44.360
Sarah?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.840
<i>Were you even listening to me?</i>

06:45.883 --> 06:47.319
Whew. I need
the world's greatest gift basket

06:47.363 --> 06:50.192
sent to Andrew MacKenzie.
A.S.A.P.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.069
What did I just do?

06:59.201 --> 07:01.464

You okay?

07:22.311 --> 07:24.095
Oh, sure.

07:24.139 --> 07:28.535
It's just one of those days
where your whole life changes.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.320
This is the time of year
for new beginnings, right?

07:31.363 --> 07:34.062
New beginnings
and finishing what we started,

07:34.105 --> 07:36.934
no matter how scary
it might be.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.283
Yeah.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.894
Thank you, love.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.373
You got to trust
you're on the right path.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.723
Yeah, well,

07:42.766 --> 07:45.290
I just quit my job
with no new prospects.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.597
Does that sound like
the right path?

07:47.641 --> 07:49.338
Maybe.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.035
You know what they say.

07:51.079 --> 07:54.691
You know, God shuts a door,
He opens a window.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.214
You just gotta find
your window.

07:56.258 --> 07:59.043
Mm. I worry
I know where my window is,

07:59.087 --> 08:02.873
and it's in someone's house
that might not want to see me.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.747
Maybe take a chance
and find out?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.749
You never know
what might pay off.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.448
Now, do you think
I'm gonna see you

08:12.492 --> 08:14.929
at my charity pop-up concert
on the 20th?

08:14.972 --> 08:16.365
You know
I wouldn't miss it!

08:16.408 --> 08:18.236
Hey, uh, any chance
you could play me off

08:18.280 --> 08:20.325
with something
super-Christmassy?

08:20.369 --> 08:22.545
I feel like
this is a big moment for me.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.808
I think there is
a very good chance.

You're telling me
there's been no progress?

08:44.698 --> 08:47.570
There are no toys
for the kids, at all?

08:48.702 --> 08:50.486
- Hey, sis.
- I have to go.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.183
There might be someone here
who can help.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.708
Yeah. Thank you. Bye.

08:55.970 --> 08:58.581
Hi. Look who decided to show up.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.718
Two sugars

09:04.761 --> 09:06.371
and a little extra
whipped cream,

09:06.415 --> 09:07.982
just like you like it.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.593
I call this a "hot sugar"
instead of a hot chocolate.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.029
So, what's going on with you?

09:12.073 --> 09:16.381
I've been thinking about
you and Dad, actually.

09:16.425 --> 09:20.081
Even Katherine and Justin,
believe it or not.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.649
Wait! Is that gingerbread?
Are we making houses?

09:22.692 --> 09:24.564
Fun!

09:24.607 --> 09:25.826
I quit my job.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.610
- What?
- Yeah.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.698
That's what I wanted
to tell you.

09:28.742 --> 09:31.919
I just needed something...
bigger.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.181
So you're coming back
to the family business?

09:33.224 --> 09:34.095
- No.
- Yes.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.226
- No. No!
- Yes.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.925
I can't.
Not since "the Disagreement."

09:37.968 --> 09:39.622
It's not really an option.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.711
Forget about the Disagreement.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.626
You need us

09:43.670 --> 09:45.715
and, more importantly,
we really need you.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.283
I just-- I wanted to tell you

09:48.326 --> 09:50.024
that I'm gonna have
more free time

09:50.067 --> 09:52.635
and figure I can maybe
ease back into...

09:53.723 --> 09:55.769
Wait.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.119
What do you mean,
you need me?

09:59.773 --> 10:01.296
It's...

10:01.339 --> 10:03.733
complicated.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.261
Okay, no, it's not, actually.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.656
We lost all of the donated money

10:13.700 --> 10:15.832
and we might have
to cancel the Giveaway.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.663
Okay, start from the beginning.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.665
Fill me in on everything.

10:22.709 --> 10:23.971
So...

10:24.014 --> 10:26.060
we hired a firm
to take over the donations,

10:26.103 --> 10:28.062
so we had more time
to focus on The Giveaway,

10:28.105 --> 10:30.760
and the firm did a great job
at first.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.415
Dad was over the moon,
everyone was so excited.

10:33.458 --> 10:37.332
But then the business
went bankrupt with no notice.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.552
All of the money
was just... gone.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.643
I just saw something like this
on some talk show.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.949
Yeah. They did it
to a bunch of charities.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.734
It's been all over the news.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.518
How could we let this happen?

10:51.476 --> 10:54.436
I have to go in to work,
but come with me.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.046
Um, I don't think so.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.397
Is Dad gonna be there?

10:59.441 --> 11:01.182
No, he's working
from home today.

11:03.488 --> 11:04.838
Come on!

11:04.881 --> 11:08.450
You know
everyone wants to see you.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.065
The place looks different.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.764
That's the "Justin touch".

11:17.807 --> 11:19.591
I never wanted
to run the company,

11:19.635 --> 11:21.724
so after you left,
Dad made him V.P.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.508
That was supposed
to be your job.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.554
No, that was supposed
to be your job.

11:25.597 --> 11:29.950
You had a vision of a warm,
caring family business.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.081
That's what Mom always wanted.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.257
Yeah, and Dad wanted to expand.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.911
Mm. The Disagreement.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.435
Well, with Justin's help,
we have expanded--

11:37.479 --> 11:40.003
focusing on profits
over client relationships.

11:40.047 --> 11:43.746
But the relationships is what
sets Silver Investments apart.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.182
I know.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.794
Unfortunately, we started
outsourcing more and more,

11:47.837 --> 11:49.230
and eventually, we outsourced--

11:49.273 --> 11:51.319
The Giveaway.

11:51.362 --> 11:54.757
What about hosting
a local giveaway?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.194
handing out toys to the kids
in the neighborhood

11:57.238 --> 11:58.805
on Christmas Day?

11:58.848 --> 12:01.808
Mom started The Giveaway
so no one would go without.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.505
For some kids,

12:03.548 --> 12:06.377
these are the only toys
they'll get during the holiday.

12:06.421 --> 12:09.119
If the press finds out,
they'll blame us.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.860
It could all be over.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.080
Not just this year,
but every year.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.734
<i>If</i> the press finds out.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.084
What if...

12:17.127 --> 12:19.260
we make the Silver Belles Ball

12:19.303 --> 12:22.002
a huge fundraising event
this year?

12:22.045 --> 12:24.744
But that event
is for clients and friends,

12:24.787 --> 12:26.267
to celebrate the money
they've already raised

12:26.310 --> 12:27.485
for The Giveaway.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.271
What if, this year,
it's not?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.229
We get someone to host--

12:32.273 --> 12:35.189
someone who'll bring in
new donors,

12:35.232 --> 12:38.279
entice them
to make big donations.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.281
Collect donations
at the event?

12:40.324 --> 12:42.283
Yes! And then we rush out,

12:42.326 --> 12:46.591
we buy all the toys,
just in time.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.203
We might be able
to save The Giveaway.

12:49.246 --> 12:52.815
You realize you've been saying
"we" for a while now, right?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.862
A friend of mine
recently said

12:55.905 --> 12:59.517
that God closes a door
and opens a window.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.216
This is my window.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.827
I'm not supposed
to find a new job.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.047
I'm supposed to find my old one.

13:07.090 --> 13:10.485
That sounds great to me.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.442
Let's get started.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.792
Okay.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.534
No, I understand.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.754
Thank you. Yeah, bye.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.538
That was my last contact.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.063
Has anyone had any luck?

13:24.412 --> 13:25.805
I can't believe

13:25.848 --> 13:28.459
we can't get one known person
to host this thing.

13:28.503 --> 13:31.636
Everyone is either booked,
busy, or uninterested.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.856
The ball is in a week.
It's too close to Christmas.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.858
Everyone's committed already.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.600
We need someone
who's super-famous

13:38.643 --> 13:40.907
and has zero plans
for the holidays.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.430
- That's it!
- What's it?

13:42.473 --> 13:44.519
We don't need someone

13:44.562 --> 13:46.913
who doesn't know
what happened to us--

13:46.956 --> 13:50.133
we need someone
who knows all about it.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.704
Hey, Jack.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.010
Hey, Mac.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.750
Hey, buddy!

13:59.926 --> 14:02.537
What is going on here?
What is all this?

14:02.580 --> 14:05.670
Looking for replacements
for all the funds we lost.

14:05.714 --> 14:08.064
I'm paying for it right now,
but it's not gonna last forever.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.197
Why are you so late?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.547
I just got another offer.

14:12.590 --> 14:15.419
A meet-and-greet that's gonna
double your quote, huh?

14:15.463 --> 14:17.639
I don't have a quote,

14:17.682 --> 14:19.380
because I don't do
in-person events.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.077
You know how I feel
about working the room.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.950
Well, we gotta fix
your image, Jack.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.995
At best, everyone thinks
you're just a hothead

14:26.039 --> 14:27.779
who gambled with
his charity's money.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.999
And, at worst...

14:30.043 --> 14:31.827
You don't even wanna know.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.090
Even after this publicity blitz
I've been on?

14:34.134 --> 14:36.397
Oh, yeah.
We're still fielding questions

14:36.440 --> 14:38.225
about why you're such a Grinch
about Christmas.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.791
Oh, come on!

14:39.835 --> 14:41.924
- All I said--

14:41.968 --> 14:43.708
Really? The Aviators?

14:45.493 --> 14:47.277
- It's my lucky hat.
- Yeah?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.018
I figured
I could use the luck.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.237
Aw, man.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.326
First team in the minors
to let you start.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.589
Mm. You were...
what were you, 23?

14:54.632 --> 14:55.807
22.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.723
Threw my first no-hitter
up there.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.814
Hey.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.381
Jack, look.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.124
We're gonna fix this, okay?

15:08.168 --> 15:11.345
You're not gonna have
to shut down the food bank.

15:11.388 --> 15:15.566
Mac, you've been my agent
since the Aviators.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.133
We've been through
a lot together,

15:17.177 --> 15:19.875
but I always know
when you think it's bad.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.445
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.971
Oh, sorry. This late,
it can only be spam or business.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.190
Either way--

15:30.233 --> 15:32.801
Ahem. Mac Peterson's phone.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.675
Oh! Well, you couldn't have
called at a better time.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.722
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, no.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.942
Go ahead, go ahead.
I'm listening.

15:44.595 --> 15:45.988
Yes.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.642
Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.862
That would be perfect.
I'll be waiting.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.169
Well, what did he say?

15:53.213 --> 15:54.518
He said he's gonna need
a little of time

15:54.562 --> 15:55.693
to run it by Jack Kane,

15:55.737 --> 15:57.260
and to expect his call later.

15:57.304 --> 15:58.348
I hope this works.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.307
Yeah, I hope so, too.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.309
Hey, speaking of later,
what are you doing for dinner?

16:09.490 --> 16:10.708
I can't.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.188
Sure you can.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.060
I haven't seen Dad in months.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.018
He is super-excited
to see you,

16:16.062 --> 16:17.759
and it's the Christmas season--

16:17.802 --> 16:19.761
when better time
to put the past behind you?

16:22.285 --> 16:26.246
Oh. I was, uh, just...
checking for carolers.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.161
Mm-hmm.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.424
Who am I kidding? Come here!

16:32.078 --> 16:33.079
Hi, Dad.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.515
Oh, ho!

16:34.558 --> 16:37.518
Come in. Dinners have not
been the same without you.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.823
Come in, my love.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.000
Here we go.

16:42.479 --> 16:46.222
Well, sure is nice
to have you join us, Holly.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.007
It's been a while.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.226
Thanks, Katherine.
It's good to be home.

16:50.270 --> 16:53.012
Your dad and I
are so glad you're back.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
It it wonderful

16:55.101 --> 16:57.190
to have our "Silver Belles"
back home for Christmas.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.713
It's been a long time.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.890
You look...
You look nice.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.675
Thanks, Justin.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.286
I knew
you were gonna make it home

17:06.329 --> 17:09.115
in time for
the Silver Belles Ball.

17:09.158 --> 17:10.681
You haven't missed one yet.

17:10.725 --> 17:13.597
About that...

17:14.903 --> 17:15.860
What?

17:17.514 --> 17:20.648
But w-we've never raised funds

17:20.691 --> 17:22.476
at the Silver Belles Ball
before.

17:22.519 --> 17:25.000
We know, but we don't
have another choice.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.350
Well, it's gonna be crucial

17:27.394 --> 17:30.223
that we try to contain the story
as much as we possibly can

17:30.266 --> 17:31.659
and control the narrative.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.008
Which means we can't go back

17:33.052 --> 17:34.401
to the people
who already donated.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.359
Your stepbrother's right.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.014
We can't dip into that pool
again until next year.

17:39.058 --> 17:44.063
Which is why new faces
at the ball is the trick.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.936
Your mother would...

17:47.979 --> 17:50.678
just be so disappointed if...

17:50.721 --> 17:52.549
That's why
this is so import--

17:52.593 --> 17:53.898
You know, maybe--

17:53.942 --> 17:54.856
if I may--

17:54.899 --> 17:56.379
maybe this is an opportunity.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.685
An opportunity?

17:57.728 --> 17:59.208
Yes.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.515
It might be time
to let the toy giveaway go.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.646
No!

18:02.690 --> 18:05.519
There is a way out of this.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.042
But the Giveaway
is the whole reason

18:07.086 --> 18:09.305
you started the company
in the first place.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.699
Dad, you invested a little

18:11.742 --> 18:13.788
from everyone
in the neighborhood

18:13.831 --> 18:15.790
just so you could make enough
to buy toys for the kids.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.618
Yeah.

18:19.533 --> 18:20.621
You know, when we first started,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.405
we barely had enough

18:22.449 --> 18:26.409
to get some dolls
and a few wooden toys.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.933
But over time,
it grew and it grew.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.632
It's the heart of this company.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.939
There won't be a giveaway
if we don't have a company.

18:34.983 --> 18:38.160
All I'm saying is we put
the event on pause,

18:38.204 --> 18:39.466
for a year or two.

18:39.509 --> 18:40.554
A year or two?

18:40.597 --> 18:42.164
Just until we can regroup.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.428
Uh, put a pause on this.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.734
I'll be right back.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.041
Holly Silver.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.000
<i>Hey, Holly.
This is Jack Kane.</i>

18:52.043 --> 18:54.481
Hi. Thanks for calling.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.396
Yeah. My agent said
that we've met before?

18:56.439 --> 18:57.614
<i>Yes.</i>

18:57.658 --> 19:00.400
I was the publicist
for Andrew McKenzie

19:00.443 --> 19:02.010
at "Wake Up, Bay City."

19:02.053 --> 19:03.403
Oh, yeah!

19:03.446 --> 19:04.882
How'd that work out?

19:04.926 --> 19:07.102
I ended up quitting.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.278
So... not great.

19:09.322 --> 19:12.151
Oh, well, I'm in
a much better place now.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.674
Happy to hear it.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.067
Uh, my agent said that
you had an offer for me,

19:16.111 --> 19:17.112
something I should
really listen to?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.679
Yes.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.507
So, there's this fundraiser--

19:20.550 --> 19:23.249
Oh, whoa, whoa, hold on.
He also should've told you

19:23.292 --> 19:24.946
that I'm not interested
in personal appearances.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.904
He did.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.211
But this is different.

19:29.255 --> 19:32.040
<i>This is a very special cause.</i>

19:32.083 --> 19:36.218
Could we maybe meet in person
and talk about it?

19:36.262 --> 19:39.003
For years, this event
has drained resources

19:39.047 --> 19:40.266
and, frankly,
we can't afford it anymore.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.093
I think Justin's right.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.747
We should cancel.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.316
No.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.061
I just need a few days.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.672
What happens in a few days?

19:57.021 --> 19:59.328
We find out
if a famous baseball player

19:59.372 --> 20:00.982
will save the day.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.254
What did you just do?

20:12.298 --> 20:15.126
Dad just seemed so upset,
I-- it--

20:15.170 --> 20:17.303
I needed to say something,
and it just slipped out,

20:17.346 --> 20:18.913
now I wish
I could take it back.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.219
It's too late for that now.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.570
There is a chance

20:23.613 --> 20:25.659
that Jack Kane can help us
with the fundraiser, right?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.138
I hope.

20:27.182 --> 20:30.272
I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow,
but I-I don't know.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.885
Wow.

20:34.929 --> 20:39.150
I can't believe
that they kept our room intact.

20:39.194 --> 20:43.198
It's the only one that Dad
won't let Katherine touch.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.070
How many nights did we spend
talking on our beds?

20:46.114 --> 20:48.203
Oh...

20:48.247 --> 20:50.249
all of them.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.469
Mostly about boy bands.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.907
Or, well, boys.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.434
Aww.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.305
Remember that?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.220
Mm-hmm.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.398
That was my senior year
Silver Belles Ball.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.357
Oh.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.315
World's tallest elf.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.056
I love that outfit.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.493
Okay, let's game plan this out.

21:17.537 --> 21:20.496
What are you gonna say to Jack
when you talk to him?

21:20.540 --> 21:24.108
Well, I thought
I'd play it by ear.

21:26.459 --> 21:27.982
Okay.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.418
No pressure,

21:29.462 --> 21:32.378
but you understand
this is our last chance, right?

21:34.249 --> 21:36.425
Well, um...

21:37.905 --> 21:41.256
...we know that a rare,
in-person Jack Kane appearance

21:41.300 --> 21:42.344
will get us donors.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.954
Mm-hmm.

21:43.998 --> 21:47.088
But what does Jack Kane want?

21:47.131 --> 21:50.047
For you to stop calling him
by his full name all the time.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.485
Yes.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.356
But also...

21:54.400 --> 22:00.144
he wants his food bank
up and running again.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.842
Once The Giveaway is done,

22:01.885 --> 22:04.627
we can give him
all of our resources.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.716
He helps us,
we help him.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.022
It's a win/win.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.632
This is a great idea.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.679
Why do you look so worried?

22:14.158 --> 22:17.205
What if I can't sell this?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.685
Okay.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.251
Do you remember
when we were little,

22:20.295 --> 22:22.123
and we really wanted
to go to Europe

22:22.166 --> 22:23.690
to celebrate Christmas,

22:23.733 --> 22:27.215
and somehow you convinced Dad
to take us?

22:27.258 --> 22:29.260
- That was really fun.
- It was the best!

22:30.653 --> 22:32.612
You could talk a baby
out of its candy,

22:32.655 --> 22:33.743
if you wanted to.

22:35.441 --> 22:38.705
It is the right time of year
for miracles, isn't it?

22:38.748 --> 22:39.880
Absolutely.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.326
You sure
we're in the right place?

22:51.370 --> 22:52.719
I'm sure this time.

22:52.762 --> 22:53.850
Holly Silver.

22:53.894 --> 22:54.982
Good to see you again.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.984
Thank you so much
for making the time.

22:57.027 --> 23:00.857
I know this isn't
the usual meeting place.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.250
This isn't where people come

23:02.293 --> 23:03.599
to discuss
their charitable works?

23:03.643 --> 23:05.122
I don't think so,

23:05.166 --> 23:07.908
but there is an actual reason
why we're here.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.257
The Silver Belles Toy Giveaway?

23:09.300 --> 23:10.432
What? You know it?

23:10.476 --> 23:11.738
Well, growing up,

23:11.781 --> 23:13.000
the younger kids
in the neighborhood

23:13.043 --> 23:15.394
would get
all excited about it.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.873
You're one of those "Silvers"?

23:16.917 --> 23:18.440
My mom started The Giveaway

23:18.484 --> 23:20.399
when my sister, Eve, and I
were little.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.617
She named it after us.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.054
Holly and Eve--
the Silver Belles, get it?

23:24.098 --> 23:27.928
Cute! Well, then shouldn't
this place be filled with toys?

23:27.971 --> 23:30.887
Yes. Now you're getting
to why you're here.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.977
Mac said you were had
by the same company

23:34.021 --> 23:35.326
that got the food bank.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.980
I feel you.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.329
That's why I came.

23:38.373 --> 23:41.420
But truth be told,
I don't think I'm your guy.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.073
Maybe just hear me out,

23:43.117 --> 23:45.293
and then you can
make up your mind?

23:46.686 --> 23:48.601
Okay.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.215
I'm sorry, Miss Silver--

23:54.258 --> 23:55.564
Oh, please, call me Holly.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.305
Holly.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.089
I appreciate
your predicament, but...

24:00.134 --> 24:01.265
...it's not for me.

24:01.309 --> 24:02.789
Helping kids
is not for you?

24:02.832 --> 24:04.573
Yeah-- No!

24:04.617 --> 24:07.054
Listen. If you want me
to write a check--

24:07.097 --> 24:08.359
you got it.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.926
If you want a couple
of autographed pictures

24:09.970 --> 24:11.319
to auction off, sure.

24:11.362 --> 24:14.496
But an entire night
of shaking hands

24:14.540 --> 24:16.890
and asking people for money,
face-to-face?

24:16.933 --> 24:19.806
I'm sorry, it's just not me.

24:19.849 --> 24:23.853
We need star power
to get new money for our event,

24:23.897 --> 24:26.247
and someone like you
will get people filing in.

24:26.290 --> 24:29.206
A few photo-ops,
some autographs...

24:29.250 --> 24:30.643
You're not helping your case.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.863
This could be
mutually beneficial.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.518
You help us now,

24:36.562 --> 24:38.912
and in the new year,
Silver Investments will help you

24:38.955 --> 24:41.523
raise capital
for your food bank.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.612
The Giveaway has been
a charity for decades,

24:43.656 --> 24:45.222
but we just don't have
enough time

24:45.266 --> 24:47.181
with all these setbacks.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.748
We need someone like you
to help us,

24:48.791 --> 24:50.967
otherwise there won't be another giveaway.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.928
That's my case.

24:56.103 --> 24:59.410
My advice?
Do what I did.

24:59.454 --> 25:01.500
Release a statement
apologizing to the public,

25:01.543 --> 25:02.588
explain what happened,

25:02.631 --> 25:04.154
and you'll get through it.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.808
The company
might get through this,

25:05.852 --> 25:08.245
but what about the kids?

25:08.289 --> 25:10.900
They won't get
a Christmas this year.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.731
Not everyone's
a big fan of Christmas.

25:17.298 --> 25:19.474
Oh...

25:19.518 --> 25:22.085
right, of course.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.913
There's "too much Christmas"
everywhere.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.262
Mm-hmm.

25:25.306 --> 25:28.135
And you don't have any plans
for the holidays--

25:28.178 --> 25:29.310
wait, wait, wait!

25:29.353 --> 25:31.747
You don't like Christmas.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.401
It's not--

25:34.837 --> 25:36.970
Holly, you seem like
a really nice person

25:37.013 --> 25:40.582
and I hope you find
a way out of this...

25:40.626 --> 25:42.541
but I'm not the way.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.589
I understand, Mr. Kane.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.549
Thank you for taking the time
to talk with me.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.246
Jack.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.161
Best of luck to you.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.119
Thank you.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.393
He said no?

26:09.437 --> 26:10.960
I don't know
what I was thinking.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.399
You were thinking
we need a miracle.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.619
Sometimes,
they don't work out.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.838
Now what?

26:18.881 --> 26:20.100
Jinx!

26:22.232 --> 26:23.973
Eve Silver.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.106
<i>The Gazette?</i>

26:26.149 --> 26:27.803
Uh...

26:27.847 --> 26:29.631
No comment.

26:29.675 --> 26:33.200
Yes. Please call my assistant
and set up a scheduled meeting.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.331
Thank you.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.811
Bye.

26:37.465 --> 26:38.597
What do they have?

26:41.338 --> 26:43.819
They don't have the full story,
but they're gonna get it.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.127
This isn't good.

26:49.259 --> 26:52.436
You took that
from Dad's house?

26:52.480 --> 26:53.742
I thought it looked cute here,

26:53.786 --> 26:56.832
bring some Christmas cheer
to the office.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.663
I'm gonna go out for a bit.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.099
Where are you going?

27:03.143 --> 27:05.014
I don't know.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.363
Gain a little perspective.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.038
Here you go.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.128
All right,
it's nice to see you again.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.653
We have got to stop
meeting like this.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.089
Jack!

27:36.132 --> 27:37.873
What are you doing here?

27:37.917 --> 27:39.135
This is where I grew up.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.615
The old neighborhood.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.269
I come by
to check on some people,

27:42.312 --> 27:43.662
make sure everything's
all right.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.708
Now, I've never
seen you around here.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.668
Well, maybe you should've
been looking harder.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.975
I, uh, used to come here
as a kid with my mom.

27:53.019 --> 27:55.499
I loved coming here with her.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.807
You know what?

27:58.851 --> 28:00.722
If you spent any time here
as a kid,

28:00.766 --> 28:03.812
then I know exactly what would
hit the spot right now.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.205
Come on.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.207
Okay.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.776
Thank you.
Oh, just rip into it.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.908
Mm.

28:12.952 --> 28:14.693
I forgot how great these are.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.085
Come on!

28:16.129 --> 28:18.697
Once you try one of these,
you are hooked for life.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.308
Actually, I used
to sell these right here.

28:21.351 --> 28:24.659
I needed money for uniforms
and away games,

28:24.703 --> 28:25.834
and this paid for it all.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.967
Believe it or not...

28:28.010 --> 28:30.056
that was the best job
I ever had

28:30.099 --> 28:31.013
and I played in the big leagues.

28:32.188 --> 28:34.190
I'm assuming

28:34.234 --> 28:36.018
that if your folks couldn't pay
for away games,

28:36.062 --> 28:39.326
they didn't have much more
for Christmas gifts either.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.458
Something like The Giveaway
could have helped.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.852
You really never give up.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.159
You're like Santa's helper
or something, aren't you?

28:46.202 --> 28:48.030
Mm, like a... an elf.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.513
An elf.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.254
That's it.

28:54.297 --> 28:56.604
That's what?

28:56.647 --> 28:59.738
Christmas wasn't influential
in your life...

29:01.087 --> 29:06.396
What if I could make you see
how important it is to the kids?

29:06.440 --> 29:08.747
I'm not following.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.967
You have to feel Christmas--

29:12.011 --> 29:15.841
not just intellectually,
but deep inside.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.668
What if--

29:17.712 --> 29:19.583
now hear me out--

29:19.627 --> 29:22.151
I give you
one perfect Christmas?

29:24.632 --> 29:25.720
What?

29:26.895 --> 29:28.505
I don't think
it's an accident

29:28.549 --> 29:30.812
that we ran into each other
like this.

29:30.856 --> 29:33.249
I think it's... a sign.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.297
Okay, I'm sorry,
and I am trying here,

29:37.340 --> 29:39.429
but I have no idea
what you are talking about.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.127
Okay.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.955
Between now
and The Giveaway,

29:42.998 --> 29:46.697
what if I walk you through
what it should feel like

29:46.741 --> 29:48.917
during Christmas,

29:48.961 --> 29:50.223
and at the end,

29:50.266 --> 29:52.007
if you still don't want
to do the event,

29:52.051 --> 29:53.487
I'll walk away.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.271
- And the ball's on the 23rd?
- Yeah.

29:55.315 --> 29:58.144
So, between now and then,

29:58.187 --> 30:00.842
your plan is to do
a bunch of Christmassy stuff

30:00.886 --> 30:02.409
to ignite my love

30:02.452 --> 30:04.672
for everything Christmas,

30:04.715 --> 30:07.066
like a magical elf?

30:07.109 --> 30:09.590
Yes. That's exactly right.

30:09.633 --> 30:12.158
But less weird
than how it sounds.

30:14.334 --> 30:17.511
Well, since you clearly
will never give up,

30:17.554 --> 30:20.775
um, let me think on it,
mull it over.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.908
I'll start prepping
all my magic.

30:22.951 --> 30:26.085
Just...
let me think about it.

30:31.699 --> 30:34.267
You lost me
at the whole "elf" thing.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.703
You had to be there
for that part.

30:35.746 --> 30:36.747
The point is,

30:36.791 --> 30:37.966
Jack is lost,

30:38.010 --> 30:40.229
and I am gonna help him
be found.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.275
He doesn't know it yet,
but deep in his heart,

30:42.318 --> 30:44.886
he is going to love
The Giveaway.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.670
That sounds like
a long shot.

30:46.714 --> 30:49.543
He needs to just get
the Christmas spirit,

30:49.586 --> 30:51.501
and then
he is going to want to help

30:51.545 --> 30:53.286
more than anything
in the world,

30:53.329 --> 30:54.940
just like Mom did for us.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.985
She showed us
the Christmas spirit,

30:57.029 --> 30:59.379
and I'm going to do
the same thing for Jack.

30:59.422 --> 31:02.077
Are you going to wear that
the whole time?

31:02.121 --> 31:04.514
Ah, you bet I am.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.428
- Oh. It's Dad.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.822
Oh. Uh...

31:07.866 --> 31:09.215
Hey.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.086
Hey Dad, what's up?

31:11.130 --> 31:12.827
I'm here, too. Hey.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.263
Hey, girls.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.918
Um, look, I don't want
to stress you out or anything,

31:16.962 --> 31:19.355
but <i>The Gazette</i> called me.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.530
And they're on to something.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.271
Oh.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.794
Yeah, well--

31:23.838 --> 31:25.666
Yeah, they called here, too.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.407
<i>And what
are we going to tell them?</i>

31:27.450 --> 31:30.845
Uh, well, we don't
tell them anything yet.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.978
What are we waiting for, honey?

31:33.021 --> 31:35.110
<i>A Christmas miracle.</i>

31:35.154 --> 31:36.285
This isn't a joking matter.

31:36.329 --> 31:37.678
<i>I-I know.</i>

31:37.721 --> 31:39.114
- It's just...

31:39.158 --> 31:41.290
Uh, one-- one second.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.948
Uh, Dad, we're gonna
have to call you back.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.907
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.827
Uh... hey.

31:56.871 --> 31:59.091
So... uh, what do you think?

31:59.134 --> 32:01.397
Honestly, I've given it
a lot of thought.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.619
Okay.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.142
Yeah.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.579
I... I understand.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.581
Bye.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.238
I'm gonna have to show this man

32:16.282 --> 32:18.849
the best Christmas
he's ever had.

32:18.893 --> 32:20.286
- He's in!
- Oh, my gosh!

32:20.329 --> 32:21.374
- He's in?
- He's in!

32:24.029 --> 32:25.987
Sorry I left you hanging there.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.694
A skating rink? Really?

32:37.738 --> 32:40.001
Just give it a chance.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.350
We are gonna do

32:41.394 --> 32:43.918
some fun, cheesy,
heartwarming things this week,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.267
so you need to be open.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.616
I wasn't complaining.

32:46.660 --> 32:49.489
I just thought
it was a little predictable.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.665
Well, we're just
starting off slowly.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.275
I hope you know how to skate.

32:53.319 --> 32:55.712
Just because I don't care
for Christmas stuff

32:55.756 --> 32:57.801
doesn't mean
I don't care for winter stuff.

32:57.845 --> 32:59.455
That's a good point.

32:59.499 --> 33:00.630
I'll be sure
to keep that in mind

33:00.674 --> 33:02.067
when I'm plotting
the next event.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.677
You have to admit,

33:03.720 --> 33:05.635
it's really nice here
at this time of year.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.247
What?

33:08.290 --> 33:10.118
Aren't you
forgetting something?

33:10.162 --> 33:12.338
Oh!

33:13.426 --> 33:15.558
Ta-dah!

33:15.602 --> 33:18.170
Funny. Not what
I was talking about, though.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.389
Oh...

33:20.433 --> 33:21.738
No. No, no, no.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.044
I am here

33:23.088 --> 33:24.524
to support you.

33:24.567 --> 33:25.525
Mm-mm.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.223
No, I am terrible at this.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.964
No!

33:43.760 --> 33:45.632
- Oh!

33:47.242 --> 33:49.070
You were not kidding.

33:49.114 --> 33:51.420
Oh! Clearly, I didn't
think this through.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.074
- Yeah.
- I'm terrible at this.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.206
I got weak ankles.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.555
Ah!

33:55.598 --> 33:57.513
You sure
you know what you're doing?

33:57.557 --> 33:59.602
Does it look like
I know what I'm doing?

33:59.646 --> 34:02.040
I meant, teaching me
about the spirit of Christmas.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.911
Oh, that.

34:03.954 --> 34:05.304
I'm not sure.

34:05.347 --> 34:08.524
But, you know, once us elves
commit to something,

34:08.568 --> 34:10.439
we are sworn to see it through.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.788
It's not gonna be easy.

34:11.832 --> 34:13.138
I don't even know what
the perfect Christmas

34:13.181 --> 34:14.226
would even look like.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.532
Well, that's the point, right?

34:16.576 --> 34:21.015
It's not one universal thing,
it's... personal.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.887
Everyone's got their perfect
little Christmas--

34:23.931 --> 34:25.541
we just need to figure out
what yours is.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.501
You're making this up
as you go, right?

34:28.544 --> 34:30.416
I sure am! Oh.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.113
- Aw.
- Oh, ho.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.550
For example--

34:34.594 --> 34:36.596
if you close your eyes,

34:36.639 --> 34:39.773
you think about Christmas,
what do you see?

34:41.296 --> 34:43.211
I got nothing.

34:43.255 --> 34:45.648
Well, we got lots of time
to figure that out.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.128
Sort of.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.739
Well, time is definitely
the one thing I've never had.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.263
Ever since I was 14,

34:51.306 --> 34:53.047
all I've ever thought about
was work.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.180
First, part-time,
then night work,

34:55.223 --> 34:56.398
and then baseball.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.183
Oh. What about girlfriends?

34:58.226 --> 35:00.185
Yeah, well...

35:00.228 --> 35:01.577
it's tough to focus
on relationships

35:01.621 --> 35:03.536
with that schedule.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.668
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:05.712 --> 35:07.148
I-I didn't mean to-- Oh!

35:08.454 --> 35:10.282
Oh!

35:10.325 --> 35:11.805
Hey, hey...

35:11.848 --> 35:13.285
Okay, we're done here.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.635
Fair. Totally fair.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.506
Okay.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.334
Whoo...

35:21.031 --> 35:23.991
I'm just gonna need some time
to figure out your next event,

35:24.034 --> 35:26.733
which will involve
less falling down.

35:26.776 --> 35:29.170
You seem pretty confident
you're gonna make this work.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.825
Well, I don't have a choice.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.176
You know what, I'm in.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.526
Yeah, yeah, just tell me
what the next event is

35:37.570 --> 35:38.701
and I'll be there.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.355
You wanna keep skating,

35:40.399 --> 35:42.488
or are you gonna stick with
that whole "weak ankles" story?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.013
I think
my skating days are over,

35:46.056 --> 35:47.536
but you go on.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.364
Uh, I'll call you later.

35:49.408 --> 35:50.757
Mm. Okay.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.152
Show-off!

36:03.204 --> 36:05.598
And then he made me
put on those skates!

36:05.641 --> 36:08.122
But you have those weak ankles.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.863
I know,
that's what I said!

36:12.257 --> 36:13.780
It's weird, right?

36:13.823 --> 36:16.261
That he doesn't know what
he wants to do for Christmas?

36:16.304 --> 36:18.654
Isn't it your job
to figure it out?

36:18.698 --> 36:22.223
Yeah. I just thought
it would be clearer.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.008
You'll be able to make this
work with Jack, right?

36:25.052 --> 36:27.620
It's kind of
our last chance.

36:27.663 --> 36:30.318
I am gonna give it
the old elf try.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.841
I promise you that.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.409
You know there's no such thing
as "an elf try," right?

36:34.453 --> 36:35.671
I mean it, Eve.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.543
I'm going to make this work.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.371
All right.

36:39.414 --> 36:41.155
Hey, what does his tree
look like?

36:42.896 --> 36:44.506
His tree?

36:44.550 --> 36:46.204
Yeah, like, is it all fabulous?

36:47.422 --> 36:48.728
What?

36:50.425 --> 36:52.297
You're a genius.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.170
- Okay.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.606
- Bye?

37:01.741 --> 37:03.917
♪ Ta-da!

37:03.960 --> 37:05.745
Hey.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.442
Wow.

37:07.486 --> 37:10.489
And who's this little guy?

37:10.532 --> 37:11.968
That is Beasley.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.580
He's the best friend
you could ever ask for.

37:14.623 --> 37:18.148
Even better if you can get him
a piece of jerky.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.629
Oh, well, I'll make sure
I remember that for next time.

37:20.673 --> 37:21.935
Ah.

37:21.978 --> 37:24.111
Whoo.

37:24.154 --> 37:26.722
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

37:26.766 --> 37:29.377
Yeah, well, we gotta start
with the basics, Jack.

37:29.421 --> 37:31.336
Right.
The, uh, the basics.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.511
A nice tree,

37:32.554 --> 37:35.296
and we are going to, uh...

37:35.340 --> 37:37.080
decorate it...

37:38.647 --> 37:39.953
...I guess?

37:39.996 --> 37:41.302
Exactly.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.921
So it wasn't, like,
a lifelong dream?

37:51.965 --> 37:54.620
Well, it's not like
I didn't like baseball.

37:54.663 --> 37:57.449
I loved baseball,

37:57.492 --> 37:58.841
but it was just not the thing
that I was gonna do

37:58.885 --> 38:01.453
for the rest of my life,
starting from age two.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.585
I was really good at it,

38:03.629 --> 38:05.326
and it was my ticket out.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.459
I'm a put-in-the-work
kind of guy,

38:07.502 --> 38:09.548
and baseball is all about that,
so...

38:09.591 --> 38:10.810
that's what I did.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.856
But if you couldn't have
played ball,

38:13.900 --> 38:15.467
what would you have done?

38:16.424 --> 38:17.599
I don't know.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.775
Oh, I don't believe that.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.864
Everyone's got
a secret passion.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.040
This is gonna help me
with my plan.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.520
Think.

38:25.564 --> 38:28.654
What would Jack have done
if he couldn't play baseball?

38:30.960 --> 38:32.179
I got nothing.

38:32.222 --> 38:33.180
Okay.

38:33.223 --> 38:36.009
Stand up.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.968
We are going to find
the real Jack Kane,

38:39.012 --> 38:41.275
the one you lost track of
years ago.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.495
So we're putting out
a missing persons report?

38:43.538 --> 38:46.062
No, we are gonna start
by relaxing.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.368
Relaxing?

38:47.412 --> 38:48.587
Yeah.

38:48.630 --> 38:49.979
Okay.

38:50.023 --> 38:51.590
Uh, first,
let's shake out our hands.

38:51.633 --> 38:52.721
Mm-hmm.

38:52.765 --> 38:55.898
Like this. Okay.
And loosen up your arms.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.465
All right. Yeah, sure.

38:57.509 --> 38:58.988
- Yeah!

38:59.032 --> 39:00.642
Hey, come on, don't laugh.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.557
I'm new
at this whole relaxing thing.

39:02.601 --> 39:03.645
I'm usually drinking

39:03.689 --> 39:05.255
my eighth cup of coffee
right now.

39:05.299 --> 39:08.302
Uh, okay,
maybe you should sit down.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.259
Okay.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.568
Let's try...

39:13.612 --> 39:14.787
close your eyes.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.397
Breathe deeply.

39:16.441 --> 39:17.616
Have you ever done yoga?

39:17.659 --> 39:19.313
Yes, in spring training.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.532
It was a disaster--

39:20.575 --> 39:22.490
my legs got all tangled up
and I fell over.

39:22.534 --> 39:26.015
Okay, well, this is gonna be
a lot easier than that.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.277
- I promise.
- Okay.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.018
So you are going to inhale
through your nose

39:29.062 --> 39:30.411
to the count of three,

39:30.455 --> 39:32.108
and then exhale
through the mouth

39:32.152 --> 39:33.327
to the count of three.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.720
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Ready? Okay.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.766
Inhale... one, two, three.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.289
Exhale--

39:39.333 --> 39:40.508
- One--

39:40.552 --> 39:42.162
Oh. Bless you.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.469
Ooh, that one snuck up on me.
I think it's dust from the tree.

39:44.512 --> 39:47.515
You're really not
the relaxing type, are you?

39:47.559 --> 39:49.430
I'm awful.

39:49.474 --> 39:50.388
No, it's pretty cute.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.434
Uh...

39:53.478 --> 39:54.827
do we need more popcorn?

39:56.176 --> 39:58.613
Uh...

39:58.657 --> 40:01.007
you know, that reminded me
of being in drama club.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.488
We were doing all
the breathing exercises and...

40:03.531 --> 40:05.011
What?

40:05.054 --> 40:06.752
You were in a drama club?

40:06.795 --> 40:09.450
Yeah! Yeah, it was a blast.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.452
No!

40:11.496 --> 40:13.454
No. Uh-uh.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.934
This is great.

40:14.977 --> 40:15.804
You can't do anything
with this.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.415
Oh, I can!

40:17.458 --> 40:19.068
And I will.

40:19.112 --> 40:22.376
We just figured out
your next Christmas Event.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.293
It's gonna be fun.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.170
You want me to be an actor?

40:34.214 --> 40:36.216
No. Of course not.

40:36.259 --> 40:37.565
Well, maybe a little.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.785
I don't "want" to be an actor,

40:39.828 --> 40:42.744
but as far
as secret passions go,

40:42.788 --> 40:44.485
yeah,
that would have to be it.

40:44.529 --> 40:46.922
Maybe we could...

40:46.966 --> 40:48.489
put on a Christmas play.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.012
Like a nativity scene?

40:50.056 --> 40:51.753
Yeah!
And you could be a...

40:51.797 --> 40:53.494
a Wise Man!

40:53.538 --> 40:54.756
Oh, bigger!

40:54.800 --> 40:57.542
Sorry. I am not used
to taking baby steps.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.544
That's probably how
you got to where you are.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.415
Okay. Acting!

41:01.459 --> 41:02.547
I can work with that.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.245
Are you sure?

41:05.288 --> 41:06.681
Because now that
I hear you say that out loud,

41:06.725 --> 41:09.031
it sounds silly.

41:09.075 --> 41:11.338
You are talking

41:11.381 --> 41:14.254
to a full-grown woman
in an elf hat.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.649
Christmas isn't practical.

41:17.692 --> 41:20.521
It's not pragmatic.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.088
It's magical.

41:22.131 --> 41:25.221
And if acting is buried
deep inside of you,

41:25.265 --> 41:26.832
then that is our lead.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.660
Okay. There's singing, too.

41:28.703 --> 41:30.792
Now you're just teasing me.

41:30.836 --> 41:33.360
No, seriously. I was in a choir
for, like, a hot minute.

41:33.403 --> 41:35.275
Perfect!
Keep 'em coming.

41:37.407 --> 41:39.497
No, no. That's all I got.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.847
Well, that's a good start.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.588
You know what?
It's getting late.

41:43.631 --> 41:45.938
Do you mind if we finish
decorating the tree tomorrow?

41:45.981 --> 41:47.505
Yeah, definitely,

41:47.548 --> 41:48.897
and maybe I can come up
with some more stuff for you.

41:48.941 --> 41:51.900
I'm getting
a pretty good picture of you.

41:51.944 --> 41:53.511
I think I can
figure the rest out.

41:53.554 --> 41:55.208
But you hardly know me.

41:55.251 --> 41:57.340
Mm. I know more than you think.

42:00.256 --> 42:02.345
She knows more than we think.

42:08.003 --> 42:09.744
Oh!

42:09.788 --> 42:11.659
You ready for
your next Christmas event?

42:11.703 --> 42:13.095
I am pumped.

42:13.139 --> 42:15.184
Okay, well,
it's really important

42:15.228 --> 42:16.490
for you to commit fully.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.622
Whatever it is,

42:17.665 --> 42:18.971
even if it's someone
you don't like.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.146
Got it. Immerse myself.

42:20.189 --> 42:21.190
Get into character.

42:21.234 --> 42:23.062
Remember, you asked for it.

42:25.717 --> 42:27.414
That's not acting.

42:27.457 --> 42:30.330
Playing Santa Claus
is totally playing a role!

42:30.373 --> 42:32.027
Where's the stage?

42:32.071 --> 42:36.031
Whoever sits in that big chair
has to <i>be</i> Santa Claus.

42:36.075 --> 42:38.251
Kids aren't as easy to fool
as you think.

42:38.294 --> 42:40.645
I was thinking
of Shakespeare in the Park.

42:40.688 --> 42:42.560
It's too cold for leotards.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.039
Good point.

42:44.083 --> 42:46.694
Look, you're only taking over
for an hour.

42:46.738 --> 42:48.261
It won't be too busy,

42:48.304 --> 42:51.307
so you can really concentrate
on getting into character.

42:52.787 --> 42:55.921
Why, oh, why did I ever decide
to listen to an elf?

42:55.964 --> 42:58.358
Come on.
Change rooms are over there.

43:02.275 --> 43:03.929
Whoo, this thing is so hot,

43:03.972 --> 43:05.583
I should be called
"Sweaty Claus".

43:07.672 --> 43:08.716
Are you laughing at me?

43:08.760 --> 43:10.413
Oh, no!
No, no, no. I promise.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.068
You are here to help, right?

43:13.112 --> 43:16.071
Absolutely.
Now, remember.

43:16.115 --> 43:18.987
No suggestions.
Say "Ho, ho, ho."

43:19.031 --> 43:21.642
Ask them what they want,
and then you move on. Got it?

43:21.686 --> 43:22.556
Got it.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.775
Tch.

43:23.818 --> 43:24.993
Let's go.

43:26.429 --> 43:27.866
Ho, ho, ho!

43:27.909 --> 43:32.740
Ho, ho, ho. Look at all
these beautiful young faces!

43:37.702 --> 43:39.094
All right. Here we go.

43:39.138 --> 43:41.227
Ho, ho, ho!

43:41.270 --> 43:45.710
What would you like
for Christmas, little girl?

43:45.753 --> 43:47.146
I want a pretty dress.

43:47.189 --> 43:51.019
Oh! A pretty dress
for a pretty little girl.

43:51.063 --> 43:53.195
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

43:54.457 --> 43:56.372
I'm not joking.
This is important.

43:57.765 --> 43:59.288
Oh!

43:59.332 --> 44:00.681
Oh, but--

44:00.725 --> 44:03.031
no, no, I wasn't--
I wasn't laughing at you.

44:03.075 --> 44:05.077
Santa just says
"Ho, ho, ho" a lot.

44:05.120 --> 44:07.340
He's not--
I'm not laughing at you.

44:07.383 --> 44:10.648
Just saying "Ho, ho, ho,"
like Santa does.

44:11.779 --> 44:14.390
Can I just talk to her?

44:16.828 --> 44:19.613
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
That's-- That's a good idea.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.659
There you go.

44:24.836 --> 44:27.229
There you go.
Merry Christmas.

44:55.214 --> 44:57.259
Ho, ho, ho!

44:57.303 --> 44:58.739
Merry Christmas.

45:00.001 --> 45:02.351
I have the worst
Charley horse right now.

45:02.395 --> 45:04.571
You've played
extra innings before.

45:04.614 --> 45:05.920
You can do this.

45:08.401 --> 45:09.837
Ho, ho, ho.
Come on, young man.

45:09.881 --> 45:12.013
Come on up here
and sit on Santa's--

45:12.057 --> 45:13.711
Whoa! Ouch!

45:13.754 --> 45:16.626
Hey. I'm sorry, little guy.

45:16.670 --> 45:17.845
I didn't mean to scare you.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.631
I just want to know

45:21.675 --> 45:23.808
what would make Christmas
special for you?

45:23.851 --> 45:25.810
I'd like a bike.

45:25.853 --> 45:27.681
A bike? Okay.
That's, uh--

45:27.725 --> 45:29.378
For my sister.

45:29.422 --> 45:32.555
Oh? Okay, well,
what about for you?

45:32.599 --> 45:35.645
My sister's been
having sad days at school.

45:35.689 --> 45:37.473
I want her to feel happy.

45:37.517 --> 45:41.216
If you give her a bike,
she'll feel happy.

45:43.001 --> 45:44.654
I'll tell you what.

45:44.698 --> 45:47.745
I'm gonna make your sister happy
for Christmas.

46:00.322 --> 46:01.976
You did so well.

46:02.020 --> 46:04.283
The way you connected
with that little boy.

46:04.326 --> 46:06.198
Talk about
the spirit of giving, huh?

46:06.241 --> 46:07.895
There really is
something so...

46:07.939 --> 46:09.375
...pure...

46:10.506 --> 46:11.420
Yeah.

46:12.726 --> 46:14.162
Well, as fun as that was,

46:14.206 --> 46:16.382
I do believe that marks the end
of my acting career.

46:16.425 --> 46:17.905
I'll be sure to cancel
Shakespeare in the Park, then.

46:19.515 --> 46:22.388
Do people even know
how much fun Christmas can be?

46:32.354 --> 46:33.442
Wow, Bob.

46:33.486 --> 46:35.575
You do these pop-ups often?

46:35.618 --> 46:37.098
Yeah, during the holidays,

46:37.142 --> 46:38.578
or whenever donations
need a kick.

46:38.621 --> 46:40.275
Thank you so much
for letting Jack jump in

46:40.319 --> 46:42.234
and sing along with you.
It's a huge help.

46:42.277 --> 46:44.149
Anything for you,
Lady Christmas.

46:44.192 --> 46:45.454
Are you sure
I'm not gonna look silly?

46:45.498 --> 46:46.891
Are you kidding me?

46:46.934 --> 46:49.502
People love it when
celebs do these pop-up things.

46:49.545 --> 46:52.113
And we got you something

46:52.157 --> 46:54.028
to help you look
a little more festive.

46:54.072 --> 46:55.551
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.

46:57.771 --> 46:59.077
I am definitely
gonna look silly.

46:59.120 --> 46:59.904
No!

46:59.947 --> 47:01.514
No.

47:01.557 --> 47:03.037
Nah, it's just gonna help people
get in the Christmas spirit.

47:03.081 --> 47:04.909
- Mm-hmm.
- Exactly.

47:08.477 --> 47:10.784
How are you guys doin'?

47:11.916 --> 47:14.614
Thank you. Yeah.

47:14.657 --> 47:16.572
Thank you guys all for coming.

47:16.616 --> 47:18.879
Okay, so we've got
a special treat today--

47:18.923 --> 47:21.360
a Major League Baseball legend.

47:21.403 --> 47:24.058

Honestly,

48:09.364 --> 48:11.976
he's been totally open
to doing all this nutty stuff.

48:12.019 --> 48:15.327
I expected him to be something
and he's...

48:15.370 --> 48:17.764
Different?

48:18.896 --> 48:20.593
Hey, Bob, is pretty cute.

48:20.636 --> 48:22.508
And he went to Juilliard.

48:22.551 --> 48:24.858
Well, why doesn't he play

- Hey!
- Hey.

49:04.245 --> 49:06.682
I haven't sung like that
since I was a kid.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.815
Now you know
what caroling's like,

49:08.858 --> 49:10.512
and it was all
for a good cause.

49:10.556 --> 49:12.601
Did you see that little girl
with her dad?

49:12.645 --> 49:15.256
She was really enjoying
her day out with him,

49:15.300 --> 49:17.476
and this was all a part of that.

49:17.519 --> 49:20.261
I hate to admit it,
but you were right.

49:20.305 --> 49:21.915
This is wonderful.

49:21.959 --> 49:26.311
I would love to admit
that you were impressive.

49:27.660 --> 49:29.662
You know, when I first met you,

49:29.705 --> 49:31.446
I thought
you were just some hotshot

49:31.490 --> 49:33.231
who always had to look cool,

49:33.274 --> 49:36.321
but you are willing
to not look cool.

49:36.364 --> 49:39.063
Are you suggesting
that that wasn't

49:39.106 --> 49:41.848
the coolest performance
you have ever seen?

49:41.891 --> 49:42.936
Mm.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.372
The sweater! Right.

49:44.416 --> 49:45.895
Fair.

49:47.506 --> 49:49.551
Well, at least now you know
that when I go for something,

49:49.595 --> 49:51.292
I tend to go big.

49:51.336 --> 49:52.772
Apparently, so do you.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.340
You must really
care about your family,

49:55.383 --> 49:57.211
to work this hard for them.

49:58.734 --> 50:00.084
Come.

50:00.127 --> 50:01.433
I want to show you something.

50:08.570 --> 50:10.094
Every year,

50:10.137 --> 50:11.312
we display all the toys

50:11.356 --> 50:13.358
we'll be handing out
at The Giveaway.

50:13.401 --> 50:15.447
My favorite thing
in the whole world

50:15.490 --> 50:17.101
is to walk past here

50:17.144 --> 50:18.928
and imagine all the joy

50:18.972 --> 50:20.974
it'll bring
to the kids during the holiday.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.063
I love my family,

50:23.107 --> 50:25.935
but this year,
it's just been weird.

50:25.979 --> 50:28.677
I just started talking to my dad
after months.

50:28.721 --> 50:30.244
You're kidding.
What happened?

50:30.288 --> 50:31.550
We had an argument.

50:31.593 --> 50:33.943
Eve calls it
"The Disagreement."

50:33.987 --> 50:35.293
What was it about?

50:35.336 --> 50:37.643
When I did P.R.
for Silver Investments,

50:37.686 --> 50:41.429
my mom and I focused
on charity initiatives.

50:41.473 --> 50:43.562
Then, when my mom passed away,

50:43.605 --> 50:45.955
my dad got
more and more invested

50:45.999 --> 50:48.958
in... well, investments,

50:49.002 --> 50:52.092
and the charitable events
started taking a back burner,

50:52.136 --> 50:54.921
and I just couldn't
stay long after that.

50:54.964 --> 50:56.227
Then, once I was gone,

50:56.270 --> 50:58.881
well, he started outsourcing,

50:58.925 --> 51:00.579
and, eventually,
even The Giveaway.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.755
That's some disagreement.

51:04.409 --> 51:07.107
I wish things could go back
to the way they were.

51:08.587 --> 51:10.545
In life...

51:10.589 --> 51:14.158
I don't know if things go back
to the way they were,

51:14.201 --> 51:17.161
and that may not be a bad thing.

51:17.204 --> 51:18.988
I want to thank you
for helping me.

51:19.032 --> 51:21.774
I know why you're doing it...

51:21.817 --> 51:23.732
but it's still really nice.

51:23.776 --> 51:25.125
I'm not doing this

51:25.169 --> 51:27.606
just so you could host
The Giveaway.

51:30.522 --> 51:31.523
Come on.

51:31.566 --> 51:33.264
Today is not over yet.

51:41.141 --> 51:44.013
We are almost done.

51:44.057 --> 51:46.407
I've literally never had
a tree here.

51:46.451 --> 51:48.583
Okay, seriously, Jack,

51:48.627 --> 51:50.281
what is up
with you and Christmas?

51:50.324 --> 51:52.370
I...

51:52.413 --> 51:54.372
was the youngest of five.

51:54.415 --> 51:57.288
As you know,
we didn't have much of anything,

51:57.331 --> 52:00.987
and Christmas at my house
meant... stress.

52:01.030 --> 52:04.469
Mom and Dad arguing
about money they didn't have

52:04.512 --> 52:06.253
for presents
they couldn't afford.

52:06.297 --> 52:08.603
Christmas morning,

52:08.647 --> 52:11.432
I didn't feel happy
or excited.

52:11.476 --> 52:13.260
I felt guilty.

52:14.783 --> 52:17.134
I dreaded the holiday and...

52:17.177 --> 52:21.703
in a way,
I guess I still do.

52:21.747 --> 52:24.706
I'm sorry, Jack.

52:24.750 --> 52:27.796
You always remember how you felt
when you were a kid.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.798
It stays with you
your whole life.

52:33.019 --> 52:34.194
Well, I guess
that would be true

52:34.238 --> 52:35.717
for that little boy
with the bike, then.

52:35.761 --> 52:39.939
And the girl
from caroling, too, right?

52:39.982 --> 52:41.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:41.723 --> 52:45.640
They're always gonna remember
that feeling about Christmas.

52:45.684 --> 52:47.773
They're always
gonna remember you.

52:56.434 --> 52:58.610
We really had
an unbelievable day.

52:58.653 --> 53:01.221
I think he's starting
to fall in love with Christmas.

53:01.265 --> 53:03.615
Seems like more than
Christmas to me.

53:03.658 --> 53:05.486
What's that supposed to mean?

53:05.530 --> 53:07.271
I'm just saying what I saw.

53:08.489 --> 53:11.405
Well, you know
how guys like him are.

53:11.449 --> 53:13.625
They don't change.

53:13.668 --> 53:14.800
Guys like what?

53:14.843 --> 53:17.106
Guys like him.

53:17.150 --> 53:20.719
You know,
the "go big or go home" guys.

53:20.762 --> 53:22.808
They're so infatuated
with going big,

53:22.851 --> 53:24.897
that they don't appreciate
the little things.

53:24.940 --> 53:26.333
And like Mom always said,

53:26.377 --> 53:29.597
it's the little things
that make life worth living.

53:29.641 --> 53:31.338
Exactly.

53:32.383 --> 53:33.384
Oh, girls.

53:33.427 --> 53:35.473
That looks perfect.

53:35.516 --> 53:38.780
Could I trouble you
with a very important decision?

53:38.824 --> 53:39.912
Yeah.

54:02.891 --> 54:05.242
- Ohh!
- What's happening?

54:05.285 --> 54:07.940
It's snowing.

54:09.855 --> 54:13.032
Oh, it's perfect weather
for hot chocolate.

54:13.075 --> 54:14.251
Mm.

54:14.294 --> 54:15.861
Thank you for your help
today, Katherine.

54:15.904 --> 54:16.905
Mm-hmm.

54:22.171 --> 54:23.999
Hello?

54:25.653 --> 54:27.481
How did you get this number?

54:28.917 --> 54:30.267
No comment.

54:31.529 --> 54:33.270
Yeah, thank you.

54:34.488 --> 54:37.186
Another newspaper.
They're closing in.

54:37.230 --> 54:40.886
We have to get Jack to commit
on the record.

54:42.104 --> 54:44.281
You think
he might not help?

54:44.324 --> 54:46.979
No. I think he'll help.

54:47.022 --> 54:49.721
I was just thinking
about what Eve said.

54:49.764 --> 54:51.331
I didn't say it,
I implied it.

54:51.375 --> 54:54.334
I'm not saying
I have feelings for him.

54:55.727 --> 54:57.642
I'm just saying I've been
thinking about it...

54:57.685 --> 54:59.992
a lot.

55:00.035 --> 55:01.646
Holly...

55:01.689 --> 55:03.909
if I may...

55:03.952 --> 55:06.694
focus on
The Giveaway first.

55:06.738 --> 55:09.523
And then, after, you'll have
all the time in the world

55:09.567 --> 55:11.308
to sort your feelings.

55:24.059 --> 55:26.932
Hmm. Interesting.

55:26.975 --> 55:30.327
Looks like someone's becoming
a real "Father Christmas".

55:30.370 --> 55:33.895
Well, I just thought the place
could use a little more cheer.

55:33.939 --> 55:35.636
Really?

55:35.680 --> 55:38.378
Well, you and Holly

55:38.422 --> 55:40.815
have certainly gotten, uh.
pretty chummy together, huh?

55:40.859 --> 55:42.469
Why would you say that?

55:44.863 --> 55:46.604
It's not like that.

55:47.779 --> 55:49.302
It's not.

55:49.346 --> 55:50.956
She's...

55:50.999 --> 55:52.305
sweet and...

55:52.349 --> 55:53.437
funny.

55:53.480 --> 55:56.222
And-- And she...

55:56.265 --> 55:58.746
makes me prioritize the things

55:58.790 --> 56:00.922
that are more important in life,
you know?

56:00.966 --> 56:03.098
Oh. Yeah, you're right,

56:03.142 --> 56:05.449
that sounds like
pretty much nothing to me.

56:08.060 --> 56:09.975
Just remember,

56:10.018 --> 56:12.717
Silver Investments can really
help with our food bank.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.240
That's not
why I'd be doing it.

56:14.283 --> 56:16.242
Oh, really? Why, then?
Oh, wait!

56:16.285 --> 56:18.418
Never mind.
I think I know the answer.

56:18.462 --> 56:20.594
Take care, Jack!

56:20.638 --> 56:21.769
What is that
supposed to mean?

56:22.727 --> 56:23.945
Ruff!

56:23.989 --> 56:25.469
Oh, right.
Don't you start, too.

56:29.864 --> 56:32.127
Oh, how much further?

56:32.171 --> 56:34.347
- Almost there.
- Almost where?

56:34.391 --> 56:36.915
This one's really
gonna be a surprise.

56:36.958 --> 56:39.657
Oh, 'cause that's worked out
so well for me in the past.

56:39.700 --> 56:41.398
Okay. You ready?

56:41.441 --> 56:42.921
- Uh-huh.
- Open your eyes.

56:44.792 --> 56:46.707
What are we doing here?

56:46.751 --> 56:48.753
You said that this was
the best job you've ever had,

56:48.796 --> 56:49.971
and we agreed,

56:50.015 --> 56:51.103
that this Christmas

56:51.146 --> 56:52.278
was all about
making you feel like

56:52.321 --> 56:53.410
when you were a kid.

56:53.453 --> 56:54.672
I didn't agree to that.

56:54.715 --> 56:56.587
We agreed to it.

56:56.630 --> 57:00.417
Look. It is stocked up
with treats, baked goods, and...

57:00.460 --> 57:01.983
Pretzels!

57:02.027 --> 57:04.638
- Pretzels.
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!

57:04.682 --> 57:06.640
Here you go!
Don't worry how much it is.

57:06.684 --> 57:08.816
Here are
two different cookies.

57:08.860 --> 57:09.991
How about
a little hot chocolate?

57:10.035 --> 57:11.384
There you go.
It's on the house.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.125
Merry Christmas.
How about you, buddy?

57:13.168 --> 57:14.082
You want a brownie?

57:15.649 --> 57:17.564

57:53.382 --> 57:56.081
So, did your elf deliver?

57:56.124 --> 57:58.213
If this was what
the Christmas season was like

57:58.257 --> 57:59.650
back in the Kane household,

57:59.693 --> 58:02.000
then I would have
a different view

58:02.043 --> 58:04.089
of the whole holiday.

58:04.132 --> 58:06.308
You delivered.

58:06.352 --> 58:09.094
Oh! Jack!

58:09.137 --> 58:11.357
This is wonderful!

58:11.400 --> 58:13.490
Okay, what happens now?

58:13.533 --> 58:14.926
Uh, well...

58:14.969 --> 58:17.058
I'll call Eve and my dad
and give them the good news,

58:17.102 --> 58:19.408
and then we'll put
the word out there

58:19.452 --> 58:21.410
that you will be
at the Silver Belles Ball,

58:21.454 --> 58:23.935
announcing your face
for The Giveaway this year--

58:23.978 --> 58:25.153
Okay, okay, okay.

58:25.197 --> 58:27.329
Slow down.
I meant, what happens tonight?

58:27.373 --> 58:29.810
Oh.

58:29.854 --> 58:31.377
What do you mean?

58:31.420 --> 58:34.728
I might need to retain
your elf services

58:34.772 --> 58:35.990
a little while longer.

58:37.078 --> 58:39.037
Oh.

58:45.913 --> 58:49.134
Voila.
Should we turn the lights on?

58:49.177 --> 58:50.178
Wait, wait, wait.

58:50.222 --> 58:52.050
There is one more.

58:52.093 --> 58:54.095
And it's my favorite.

58:54.139 --> 58:55.140
I know just the spot.

58:55.183 --> 58:57.534
Here.

59:01.450 --> 59:03.409
Uh... should we...

59:03.452 --> 59:04.845
see how it looks?

59:04.889 --> 59:06.978
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

59:07.021 --> 59:08.370
- Yeah.
- Okay.

59:08.414 --> 59:10.155
Sorry.

59:10.198 --> 59:11.765
Okay.

59:32.656 --> 59:34.440
You're telling me

59:34.483 --> 59:37.617
the guy who hates Christmas
decorated a whole tree?

59:37.661 --> 59:39.619
The whole house!

59:39.663 --> 59:41.752
With about a thousand ornaments!

59:41.795 --> 59:43.928
You couldn't even see branches
when he was done.

59:43.971 --> 59:45.582
Maybe you are part elf.

59:47.671 --> 59:49.498
It really was sweet.

59:49.542 --> 59:51.588
You know, with Jack
at the ball tomorrow,

59:51.631 --> 59:53.633
it's really gonna be
something else--

59:53.677 --> 59:55.243
not to mention,

59:55.287 --> 59:57.637
everyone's gonna get to meet
the newest member of our family.

59:57.681 --> 59:59.465
Stop it.

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:03.817
Oh, it's Dad.

1:00:05.863 --> 1:00:07.429
<i>-Hello, my loves.
- Dad?</i>

1:00:07.473 --> 1:00:09.214
Is everything all right?

1:00:09.257 --> 1:00:11.042
Uh, it isn't.

1:00:11.085 --> 1:00:13.174
I just sent you a link.

1:00:15.176 --> 1:00:16.656
That's coming out tomorrow,

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:18.179
but my friend
gave me the head's up.

1:00:18.223 --> 1:00:19.354
This is all wrong.

1:00:19.398 --> 1:00:21.661
We're gonna fix everything
at the ball.

1:00:21.705 --> 1:00:23.663
I don't know what
this is gonna do to donations.

1:00:23.707 --> 1:00:24.751
Without the donations,

1:00:24.795 --> 1:00:27.145
we can't buy any toys
for the kids.

1:00:27.188 --> 1:00:29.103
Where are we with Jack?

1:00:29.147 --> 1:00:31.018
Jack's in,
but is it too late?

1:00:31.062 --> 1:00:34.456
No. We can save this.
I know it.

1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:36.197
Just let me try.

1:00:36.241 --> 1:00:37.982
<i>Well, in any event,</i>

1:00:38.025 --> 1:00:40.724
I just want to say thanks
to my Silver Belles

1:00:40.767 --> 1:00:42.421
for all you've done.

1:00:42.464 --> 1:00:46.817
<i>And for trying to do what now
seems to be the impossible.</i>

1:00:46.860 --> 1:00:48.383
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, girls.</i>

1:00:53.562 --> 1:00:57.044
So have I risen
to the "Christmas" challenge?

1:00:57.088 --> 1:00:59.351
Of course.
What do you mean?

1:00:59.394 --> 1:01:01.788
It's just The Giveaway
means so much to me.

1:01:01.832 --> 1:01:03.094
If you are gonna help,

1:01:03.137 --> 1:01:05.139
I want to make sure
that your heart is in it.

1:01:05.183 --> 1:01:06.663
Right now,

1:01:06.706 --> 1:01:08.665
it's the only thing
in my heart.

1:01:08.708 --> 1:01:09.883
No, I mean...

1:01:09.927 --> 1:01:11.319
not that I don't care
about other things,

1:01:11.363 --> 1:01:13.495
I care <i>a lot
about other things,</i>

1:01:13.539 --> 1:01:15.933
- it's just--
- I--I think I get it.

1:01:15.976 --> 1:01:17.674
Good.

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:19.501
So what's wrong?

1:01:19.545 --> 1:01:21.982
There's an article
coming out today

1:01:22.026 --> 1:01:25.899
that makes it seem like
the money was mismanaged by us.

1:01:25.943 --> 1:01:27.292
But it wasn't.

1:01:27.335 --> 1:01:29.120
Are you worried
that it's gonna affect tonight?

1:01:29.163 --> 1:01:30.991
We're going to find out.

1:01:31.035 --> 1:01:32.819
But my public support
and involvement

1:01:32.863 --> 1:01:33.951
should help, though, right?

1:01:33.994 --> 1:01:35.648
That's what we're praying for,

1:01:35.692 --> 1:01:37.781
but please, make sure
that you're there on time.

1:01:37.824 --> 1:01:40.087
It's a date!

1:01:40.131 --> 1:01:41.610
No, I mean that...

1:01:41.654 --> 1:01:42.742
I just mean--

1:01:42.786 --> 1:01:44.265
- it's not a date--
- Yeah.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:45.527
No, I-I--

1:01:45.571 --> 1:01:46.877
No, absolutely,
it's not like a date--

1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:49.009
- Ruff!
-...it's more about...

1:01:51.403 --> 1:01:54.145
I think that's him telling us
it's time for his walk.

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:57.801
- I should get going.
- Yeah.

1:01:57.844 --> 1:01:59.498
Get ready for the ball.

1:02:00.673 --> 1:02:02.936
See you then.

1:02:08.202 --> 1:02:10.639
I have some more options.

1:02:12.641 --> 1:02:14.034
This one.

1:02:14.078 --> 1:02:16.689
Uh... I don't think so.

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:18.125
- Really?
- Meh.

1:02:18.169 --> 1:02:20.606
Okay. Uh, oh! What about this?

1:02:20.649 --> 1:02:22.782
This color
looks so good on you.

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:23.870
It's a great color,

1:02:23.914 --> 1:02:25.437
it's just not the one.

1:02:26.917 --> 1:02:29.571
Okay. Ooh! This one.

1:02:29.615 --> 1:02:32.661
Oh, it swooshes. Look at that.

1:02:32.705 --> 1:02:34.315
Swoosh!

1:02:34.359 --> 1:02:36.753
I wore that one last year.
Remember?

1:02:36.796 --> 1:02:38.755
Okay, well,
I find it hard to believe

1:02:38.798 --> 1:02:40.800
that, suddenly,
none of these dresses

1:02:40.844 --> 1:02:42.193
will work for you.

1:02:42.236 --> 1:02:44.369
I had one picked out,
but I-- I don't know,

1:02:44.412 --> 1:02:46.110
it's just not...

1:02:46.153 --> 1:02:47.111
right.

1:02:48.329 --> 1:02:51.332
You mean "right"
for a certain someone.

1:02:51.376 --> 1:02:52.507
Eve.

1:02:53.552 --> 1:02:54.596
I already told you,

1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:56.990
Mr. Kane is not my type.

1:02:57.034 --> 1:02:59.819
He's probably gonna end up
in some fast-paced environment

1:02:59.863 --> 1:03:01.168
with no time for anything,

1:03:01.212 --> 1:03:03.170
because he only knows
how to "go big."

1:03:03.214 --> 1:03:04.693
Well, it seems like

1:03:04.737 --> 1:03:07.435
you're making
a very positive change in him.

1:03:07.479 --> 1:03:08.436
Hmm?

1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:09.829
No.

1:03:09.873 --> 1:03:11.700
Okay, well,
what are we looking for?

1:03:11.744 --> 1:03:13.528
Something beautiful!

1:03:13.572 --> 1:03:15.095
Dazzling.

1:03:15.139 --> 1:03:16.836
A real knock-out.

1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:19.099
Yeah, you sound
very uninterested.

1:03:20.666 --> 1:03:21.536
Oh!

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:22.842
I know!

1:03:25.149 --> 1:03:27.194
What about...

1:03:27.238 --> 1:03:29.196
this one?

1:03:32.591 --> 1:03:34.071
Hmm?

1:03:36.421 --> 1:03:38.989
I know exactly
what will go with this.

1:04:00.097 --> 1:04:02.099
Hi! Oh. Thank you for coming.

1:04:03.709 --> 1:04:05.711
You made it!

1:04:05.754 --> 1:04:07.365
So great to see you.

1:04:07.408 --> 1:04:09.541
Try not to worry, okay?

1:04:09.584 --> 1:04:10.934
It's beautiful.

1:04:10.977 --> 1:04:13.893
Yes, everything came together
really well.

1:04:13.937 --> 1:04:15.721
- Holly.
- Hi, everyone.

1:04:15.764 --> 1:04:18.463
Dad. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

1:04:18.506 --> 1:04:20.117
Okay. Good.

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:23.729
I'm just not sure how much
it will help at this point.

1:04:23.772 --> 1:04:26.210
About a quarter of the guests
we were expecting, so.

1:04:26.253 --> 1:04:28.777
We will get through this.

1:04:28.821 --> 1:04:30.518
So far, the talk
has been very kind.

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:33.870
Well, we won't really know

1:04:33.913 --> 1:04:36.568
until it's time to start
collecting donations.

1:04:38.657 --> 1:04:40.137
There's Richard Stevens.

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:42.008
We should go say hello
and see if he's heard anything.

1:04:42.052 --> 1:04:44.054
Excuse us.

1:04:45.316 --> 1:04:47.057
I'm gonna go work the room.

1:04:54.064 --> 1:04:56.327
I do love that dress.

1:04:56.370 --> 1:04:58.416
Oh, thank you.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:01.419
You know...

1:05:01.462 --> 1:05:04.988
this event, The Giveaway,

1:05:05.031 --> 1:05:08.556
it means
the whole world to us.

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:11.646
Ending it would not be simple
for this family.

1:05:13.039 --> 1:05:15.650
It would be difficult
for Justin and me as well.

1:05:15.694 --> 1:05:17.435
Of course.

1:05:17.478 --> 1:05:19.437
We love you dearly, but...

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:21.482
...sometimes, it feels like

1:05:21.526 --> 1:05:22.962
we need to remind
you and your sister

1:05:23.006 --> 1:05:24.398
that we're part
of this family, too.

1:05:27.488 --> 1:05:28.794
I need to speak
with the Roses.

1:05:28.837 --> 1:05:30.535
If you'll excuse me.

1:05:30.578 --> 1:05:31.623
Yeah.

1:05:38.456 --> 1:05:39.718
Hey, Jack.

1:05:39.761 --> 1:05:40.632
How are you doing?

1:05:42.068 --> 1:05:43.374
Hey.

1:05:43.417 --> 1:05:45.724
You look wonderful.

1:05:45.767 --> 1:05:48.335
It would be an understatement
to say the same

1:05:48.379 --> 1:05:50.250
'cause you look spectacular.

1:05:51.338 --> 1:05:52.557
Is that antique?

1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:55.603
Oh, um...
it was my mother's.

1:05:55.647 --> 1:05:57.866
Well, it is beautiful,

1:05:57.910 --> 1:05:59.216
and I feel like your mother
would be very proud

1:05:59.259 --> 1:06:00.217
of what you're doing
here tonight.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:01.435
I wanted--

1:06:03.176 --> 1:06:06.092
Please, you.

1:06:06.136 --> 1:06:08.399
I wanted to thank you
for doing this.

1:06:08.442 --> 1:06:10.096
Hey. Deal's a deal.

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:12.098
No, I mean it.

1:06:12.142 --> 1:06:15.667
You're facing your past,
and that's not easy.

1:06:15.710 --> 1:06:17.364
That's what I was gonna say.

1:06:18.626 --> 1:06:21.368
You know, this started off
as a...

1:06:21.412 --> 1:06:24.110
I don't know,
a favor, I guess?

1:06:24.154 --> 1:06:26.286
But...

1:06:26.330 --> 1:06:27.635
you have shown me

1:06:27.679 --> 1:06:29.594
the things in my life
that are missing.

1:06:31.074 --> 1:06:33.250
And I could not
be more grateful.

1:06:34.947 --> 1:06:37.384
Ladies and gentlemen--

1:06:37.428 --> 1:06:38.690
Talk about this later?

1:06:38.733 --> 1:06:40.474
I would like that a lot.

1:06:40.518 --> 1:06:42.433
...for this evening...

1:06:42.476 --> 1:06:43.608
Jack Kane.

1:06:43.651 --> 1:06:44.565
You ready?

1:06:44.609 --> 1:06:45.697
Just like running on the field.

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:47.264
Soon as I get going,
I'll be fine.

1:06:47.307 --> 1:06:48.526
- Thank you for this.

1:06:55.185 --> 1:06:57.578
Hello, everyone.

1:06:57.622 --> 1:07:00.451
Oh, thank you all for being here
for such an important cause.

1:07:00.494 --> 1:07:03.149
It seems like this is all
that's showing up.

1:07:03.193 --> 1:07:05.717
This isn't enough people.

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:06.935
We have a problem, girls.

1:07:06.979 --> 1:07:08.111
We heard.

1:07:08.154 --> 1:07:11.766
That article
really did a number on us.

1:07:11.810 --> 1:07:14.813
Even with Jack as an incentive,
not enough donors have shown up.

1:07:14.856 --> 1:07:15.944
How bad is it, Dad?

1:07:17.337 --> 1:07:18.556
We're not gonna make our quota.

1:07:18.599 --> 1:07:20.688
I'm sorry.

1:07:20.732 --> 1:07:23.517
So, no matter how much
Jack vouches for us,

1:07:23.561 --> 1:07:25.606
or what we've been able
to do in the past...

1:07:25.650 --> 1:07:28.566
There's just not gonna be
enough donations for this year.

1:07:30.263 --> 1:07:32.178
There won't be a giveaway.

1:07:33.832 --> 1:07:36.487
Maybe if we can restore faith
in our company,

1:07:36.530 --> 1:07:37.705
weather the storm,

1:07:37.749 --> 1:07:39.968
we can try again next year.

1:07:40.012 --> 1:07:41.448
Maybe.

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.407
Honey, I need you in the foyer.

1:07:43.450 --> 1:07:45.365
Excuse us.

1:07:47.019 --> 1:07:47.976
We'll figure something out.

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:49.195
Will we?

1:07:49.239 --> 1:07:51.937
Yeah. Yeah, we just need to...

1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:53.025
think big.

1:07:53.069 --> 1:07:54.853
Yeah.

1:07:54.896 --> 1:07:56.550
Go big or go home.

1:07:56.594 --> 1:07:58.117
You know what?

1:07:58.161 --> 1:07:59.771
I've had enough
with hearing that.

1:07:59.814 --> 1:08:02.034
"Going big."

1:08:03.209 --> 1:08:04.297
I went big.

1:08:05.559 --> 1:08:07.039
I quit my job.

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:09.389
I got Jack involved
in this mess,

1:08:09.433 --> 1:08:11.391
and now his name
is gonna be terrible,

1:08:11.435 --> 1:08:12.479
and that is all because of me.

1:08:13.785 --> 1:08:16.309
I'm sorry.
I just need a few minutes.

1:08:16.353 --> 1:08:17.919
Of course.

1:08:17.963 --> 1:08:19.921
So...

1:08:19.965 --> 1:08:24.839
packing up his sleigh
one last time for the night...

1:08:26.145 --> 1:08:27.842
Please donate. Thank you.

1:08:31.803 --> 1:08:33.413
Is Holly okay?

1:08:33.457 --> 1:08:35.633
She just needs a few minutes.

1:08:35.676 --> 1:08:38.462
I have some guests
I have to speak to,

1:08:38.505 --> 1:08:41.508
but thank you so much
for trying, Jack.

1:08:41.552 --> 1:08:43.815
We really appreciate it.

1:08:43.858 --> 1:08:45.338
If you'll excuse me.

1:08:47.775 --> 1:08:49.951
I feel like
I missed something here.

1:08:49.995 --> 1:08:51.736
Tonight didn't work.

1:08:51.779 --> 1:08:53.825
We're not getting
enough donations.

1:08:53.868 --> 1:08:57.176
Seems like this whole thing
was just a huge waste of time.

1:08:57.220 --> 1:08:59.178
Holly feels like this whole
thing was a waste of time?

1:08:59.222 --> 1:09:00.962
That's what she said,
in so many words,

1:09:01.006 --> 1:09:04.227
said she's had enough
of "going big."

1:09:04.270 --> 1:09:05.576
She--

1:09:05.619 --> 1:09:07.012
She said that?

1:09:07.055 --> 1:09:08.405
She said she regrets
your involvement in all of this.

1:09:08.448 --> 1:09:09.188
I'm sorry, Jack.

1:09:10.668 --> 1:09:12.322
Okay, I think there's been
a misunderstanding here--

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:14.454
All I know is, whatever
she's been up to all week,

1:09:14.498 --> 1:09:15.542
she's just plain sick of it.

1:09:15.586 --> 1:09:17.414
Frankly, I don't blame her.

1:09:17.457 --> 1:09:19.894
Regardless, thank you so much
for all you've done.

1:09:19.938 --> 1:09:21.418
I'm Justin, by the way.
Holly's stepbrother.

1:09:21.461 --> 1:09:23.202
Big fan.

1:09:23.246 --> 1:09:24.856
Wish it was under
better circumstances,

1:09:24.899 --> 1:09:27.119
but maybe next year.

1:09:28.425 --> 1:09:30.427
Well, from the looks of it,

1:09:30.470 --> 1:09:31.950
I don't think there's gonna be
a next year for me.

1:09:48.314 --> 1:09:50.403
There you are.

1:09:50.447 --> 1:09:52.710
We've been looking
all over for you.

1:09:56.279 --> 1:09:58.324
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1:09:59.630 --> 1:10:01.371
I messed everything up.

1:10:01.414 --> 1:10:04.635
I got everyone's hopes up,

1:10:04.678 --> 1:10:07.203
and now I can't save
The Giveaway.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:12.382
And it was the last thing
we had left of Mom.

1:10:12.425 --> 1:10:14.558
Aw, sweetheart.

1:10:17.343 --> 1:10:20.259
Your mother left you
many things--

1:10:20.303 --> 1:10:24.350
things that you can point to
and remember her by,

1:10:24.394 --> 1:10:26.961
but more important
than that,

1:10:27.005 --> 1:10:28.659
she left you her spirit.

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:31.923
She lives through you,

1:10:31.966 --> 1:10:35.622
through all that you do
in this world,

1:10:35.666 --> 1:10:37.798
and from what I see,

1:10:37.842 --> 1:10:40.410
you make her proud
every single day.

1:10:42.194 --> 1:10:44.109
Thanks, Dad.

1:10:45.763 --> 1:10:49.288
And she would also not want you
to live in the past.

1:10:50.637 --> 1:10:53.031
Holding on to The Giveaway
like this,

1:10:53.074 --> 1:10:55.903
it isn't holding on to her,
sweetie.

1:10:57.296 --> 1:10:59.646
She would want you
to appreciate the past,

1:10:59.690 --> 1:11:02.127
but live in the present,

1:11:02.170 --> 1:11:04.216
and look to the future.

1:11:05.913 --> 1:11:06.871
You're right.

1:11:09.613 --> 1:11:12.572
There's other ways that we can
give back to the kids.

1:11:12.616 --> 1:11:14.270
All of us,

1:11:14.313 --> 1:11:16.837
together,

1:11:16.881 --> 1:11:18.317
as a family.

1:11:18.361 --> 1:11:19.797
That's my girl.

1:11:21.973 --> 1:11:23.844
Ahh.

1:11:26.847 --> 1:11:30.068
Well, it is too bad that
Jack had to leave so quickly.

1:11:30.111 --> 1:11:31.722
What do you mean?

1:11:31.765 --> 1:11:33.332
Well, I saw him
talking to Justin

1:11:33.376 --> 1:11:35.682
and then I saw him leave.

1:11:35.726 --> 1:11:37.641
What?

1:11:45.039 --> 1:11:46.563
Hey!

1:11:46.606 --> 1:11:48.216
There you are.

1:11:48.260 --> 1:11:50.436
Why are you leaving?

1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:53.265
I... I don't know,
I heard it was a waste of time.

1:11:53.309 --> 1:11:55.267
Yeah, I know...

1:11:55.311 --> 1:11:56.616
Okay, then, well...

1:11:56.660 --> 1:11:58.923
my job's done here.

1:11:58.966 --> 1:12:00.272
Uh, thanks again.

1:12:00.316 --> 1:12:01.665
I'm sorry I got you involved--

1:12:01.708 --> 1:12:03.536
Yeah. Yeah, I heard that.

1:12:03.580 --> 1:12:05.408
Frankly, it's not a problem.

1:12:05.451 --> 1:12:07.192
Not a problem?

1:12:07.235 --> 1:12:10.369
Yeah, I mean,
it is what it is, right?

1:12:10.413 --> 1:12:12.371
Yeah, I-I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

1:12:12.415 --> 1:12:14.504
Oh, listen,
these things happen.

1:12:14.547 --> 1:12:15.853
I'm glad I could help.

1:12:15.896 --> 1:12:17.942
If anything else comes up,

1:12:17.985 --> 1:12:19.247
uh, call Mac.

1:12:19.291 --> 1:12:21.380
Uh...

1:12:37.831 --> 1:12:39.180
What was that all about?

1:12:39.224 --> 1:12:41.618
I don't know.

1:12:41.661 --> 1:12:44.621
I guess the event is over
and...

1:12:44.664 --> 1:12:47.058
so is his interest.

1:12:47.101 --> 1:12:49.016
I'm so sorry.

1:12:49.060 --> 1:12:51.018
Let's not think
about that right now.

1:12:51.062 --> 1:12:52.019
We have work to do.

1:12:53.281 --> 1:12:54.848
Yeah.

1:12:59.766 --> 1:13:01.681
Jack! Never mind.

1:13:01.725 --> 1:13:03.074
He's here.
I'll call you back.

1:13:03.117 --> 1:13:04.162
There you are.

1:13:04.205 --> 1:13:05.424
What are you doing here?

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:07.034
You okay?

1:13:07.078 --> 1:13:08.732
Yeah, what are you doing here?

1:13:08.775 --> 1:13:09.863
What do you mean?

1:13:09.907 --> 1:13:11.343
I rushed over
as soon as I heard.

1:13:11.387 --> 1:13:13.432
W-We got to try
and fix this tonight.

1:13:13.476 --> 1:13:15.216
Fix what?

1:13:15.260 --> 1:13:16.696
What? You don't know?

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:19.960
They're tying you
into the failed Giveaway,

1:13:20.004 --> 1:13:21.309
they're saying

1:13:21.353 --> 1:13:23.007
it's the second charity
you dropped the ball on.

1:13:23.050 --> 1:13:25.401
We got to get ahead
of this story right now.

1:13:28.012 --> 1:13:29.579
I don't care what Holly says.

1:13:29.622 --> 1:13:31.668
This is the time to go big.

1:13:31.711 --> 1:13:32.886
Yeah, I...

1:13:32.930 --> 1:13:35.149
Wait. What?
What are you talking about?

1:13:35.193 --> 1:13:36.803
The bases are juiced,

1:13:36.847 --> 1:13:38.065
it's the bottom of the ninth,

1:13:38.109 --> 1:13:39.110
and I gotta strike out
their side.

1:13:39.153 --> 1:13:40.633
Ha. I love it.

1:13:40.677 --> 1:13:41.721
But what does it mean?

1:13:41.765 --> 1:13:43.593
I know exactly
what we have to do.

1:13:43.636 --> 1:13:45.116
I'm gonna make
a pot of coffee,

1:13:45.159 --> 1:13:47.684
you are gonna pull up
every contact we have.

1:13:47.727 --> 1:13:48.685
It's gonna be a long night.

1:13:49.903 --> 1:13:51.427
What happened at that party?

1:14:03.003 --> 1:14:05.658
Oh. Hi.

1:14:05.702 --> 1:14:08.400
Um, I was looking for Jack.

1:14:08.444 --> 1:14:10.358
Well, hello, Holly.

1:14:10.402 --> 1:14:13.449
He's, uh, out running an errand.

1:14:13.492 --> 1:14:15.625
Although,
to be perfectly honest,

1:14:15.668 --> 1:14:18.758
I'm not really sure
he wants to hear from you.

1:14:18.802 --> 1:14:21.761
Is that why he's not
answering my calls?

1:14:21.805 --> 1:14:24.111
Did something happen
at The Giveaway?

1:14:25.373 --> 1:14:28.028
It's because you gave him away.

1:14:29.552 --> 1:14:31.510
What does that mean?

1:14:31.554 --> 1:14:34.339
Look, if you weren't
interested in him,

1:14:34.382 --> 1:14:35.688
then that's--
that's fine,

1:14:35.732 --> 1:14:39.300
but he, you know,
he really felt that

1:14:39.344 --> 1:14:40.998
you and him had a connection.

1:14:41.041 --> 1:14:43.043
We did! Uh, we do.

1:14:44.262 --> 1:14:47.091
Look, I was just
so focused on the past

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:48.440
that it was holding me back,

1:14:48.484 --> 1:14:50.181
but now I'm ready
to go forward.

1:14:50.224 --> 1:14:52.400
I'm-- I'm ready to go big.

1:14:52.444 --> 1:14:54.533
Please tell him.

1:14:55.752 --> 1:14:57.841
Tell him
that he taught me that.

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:01.322
Yeah. Absolutely.

1:15:01.366 --> 1:15:02.889
I'll definitely
give him the message.

1:15:04.108 --> 1:15:06.197
I hope to hear from him.

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:08.852
Oh, I have a very good feeling
that you will.

1:15:10.331 --> 1:15:12.551
Merry Christmas, Holly.

1:15:23.649 --> 1:15:25.042
Hey.

1:15:25.085 --> 1:15:27.044
How's it going here?

1:15:27.087 --> 1:15:30.308
I'm trying to figure out
how to put on a local Giveaway,

1:15:30.351 --> 1:15:32.571
like Mom did when
she started this whole thing.

1:15:32.615 --> 1:15:33.877
Without any donations,

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:36.401
there's no way
for us to get any gifts,

1:15:36.444 --> 1:15:40.710
let alone find a location
to invite the kids to.

1:15:40.753 --> 1:15:42.059
Exactly.

1:15:42.102 --> 1:15:45.018
It looks like it's just over
for us this year.

1:15:53.636 --> 1:15:54.767
But not for good.

1:15:56.726 --> 1:15:58.510
We just need to regroup.

1:15:58.554 --> 1:16:01.905
Double our efforts
for next year

1:16:01.948 --> 1:16:03.559
and make it up to the kids.

1:16:03.602 --> 1:16:05.865
Okay.
Where is this coming from?

1:16:05.909 --> 1:16:07.693
I realized

1:16:07.737 --> 1:16:09.260
that, sure...

1:16:09.303 --> 1:16:11.828
things seem bleak right now,

1:16:11.871 --> 1:16:14.961
but we have the one thing

1:16:15.005 --> 1:16:17.747
that will get us
through this--

1:16:17.790 --> 1:16:19.575
family.

1:16:20.793 --> 1:16:22.099
I'm in.

1:16:22.142 --> 1:16:23.143
Yes!

1:16:23.187 --> 1:16:24.971
Tell me what you want to do.

1:16:25.015 --> 1:16:27.278
Uh, first, we call
the local families,

1:16:27.321 --> 1:16:29.019
deliver them the bad news--

1:16:29.062 --> 1:16:30.498
which will be
the hardest part.

1:16:30.542 --> 1:16:33.589
but then we immediately start
prepping for next year

1:16:33.632 --> 1:16:35.852
and make sure
that this never happens again.

1:16:35.895 --> 1:16:37.941
All right.
I'll start making those calls.

1:16:40.334 --> 1:16:42.598
Did you call Jack?

1:16:42.641 --> 1:16:45.339
Invite him
to Christmas Eve dinner tonight?

1:16:45.383 --> 1:16:47.994
I don't know
what happened last night.

1:16:48.038 --> 1:16:49.692
He won't even talk to me.

1:16:49.735 --> 1:16:52.390
What a Christmas
this turned out to be, huh?

1:16:52.433 --> 1:16:53.739
Yeah.

1:16:57.482 --> 1:16:58.918
It's Jack.

1:16:58.962 --> 1:17:00.746
He got my message from Mac.

1:17:00.790 --> 1:17:02.313
Quick, hang up.

1:17:02.356 --> 1:17:03.531
Oh-- okay.

1:17:03.575 --> 1:17:05.969
"Put out word
The Giveaway is still on.

1:17:06.012 --> 1:17:06.970
Find a place.

1:17:07.013 --> 1:17:08.362
Invite the kids.

1:17:08.406 --> 1:17:10.321
I'll take care of the rest."

1:17:10.364 --> 1:17:11.801
What do we do?

1:17:14.847 --> 1:17:16.501
Trust him.

1:17:19.156 --> 1:17:21.071
You reached out to everyone?

1:17:21.114 --> 1:17:22.463
Literally everyone.

1:17:22.507 --> 1:17:24.204
Called in as many favors
as we could--

1:17:24.248 --> 1:17:25.902
even those
who haven't lost faith in us

1:17:25.945 --> 1:17:27.468
couldn't help.

1:17:27.512 --> 1:17:29.906
It's just too late to find
a place to host The Giveaway.

1:17:29.949 --> 1:17:31.559
Well, even if we found a place,

1:17:31.603 --> 1:17:34.040
I mean, how are we gonna
find the toys?

1:17:34.084 --> 1:17:35.738
- Jack said--
- Oh, Jack?

1:17:35.781 --> 1:17:37.522
Jack just ran away
from the party.

1:17:37.565 --> 1:17:39.524
I mean,
can we even trust him?

1:17:40.525 --> 1:17:41.308
Yes.

1:17:41.352 --> 1:17:42.440
We can.

1:17:43.484 --> 1:17:45.269
He seemed really upset

1:17:45.312 --> 1:17:47.575
when I told him
The Giveaway was canceled.

1:17:47.619 --> 1:17:49.403
I-I believe he wants to help us,

1:17:49.447 --> 1:17:50.753
and if there's even
the slightest chance

1:17:50.796 --> 1:17:53.320
this could work...

1:17:53.364 --> 1:17:55.932
the way The Giveaway
brought Holly back home,

1:17:55.975 --> 1:17:56.976
I see what it means to her...

1:17:58.412 --> 1:17:59.631
...what it means
to all of us.

1:17:59.675 --> 1:18:02.373
We have to try
everything we can.

1:18:05.637 --> 1:18:06.986
Why don't we hold
The Giveaway here?

1:18:07.030 --> 1:18:09.423
The decorations
from the ball are still up.

1:18:09.467 --> 1:18:11.730
There's plenty of food
left over.

1:18:11.774 --> 1:18:13.819
I think it's what your mother
would have liked--

1:18:13.863 --> 1:18:15.429
to open up the home

1:18:15.473 --> 1:18:18.171
to all the kids
in the community.

1:18:19.738 --> 1:18:22.698
Katherine's right.

1:18:22.741 --> 1:18:24.351
This is a family event...

1:18:25.788 --> 1:18:27.137
...and what better place
to host it

1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:28.138
than right here?

1:18:28.181 --> 1:18:29.617
With all of us.

1:18:29.661 --> 1:18:31.750
Together.

1:18:33.883 --> 1:18:35.754
Oh, sweetheart.

1:18:42.805 --> 1:18:45.372
I'm gonna text Jack.

1:18:45.416 --> 1:18:47.679
And then what's the plan?

1:18:47.723 --> 1:18:50.377
Well, he said to be ready
Christmas Day by 3:00 p.m.

1:18:50.421 --> 1:18:52.684
So... we'll be ready.

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:54.730
All right.

1:19:09.483 --> 1:19:12.443
Yeah, I, um...

1:19:12.486 --> 1:19:14.924
I like to get in a quiet beat
before the holiday starts.

1:19:14.967 --> 1:19:16.577
Merry Christmas, Jack.

1:19:16.621 --> 1:19:18.231
- Merry Christmas.
- You looking for Holly?

1:19:18.275 --> 1:19:19.885
No, no. For you, actually.

1:19:19.929 --> 1:19:21.365
Uh, what can I do you for?

1:19:21.408 --> 1:19:24.194
Uh, there's a shindig
happening this afternoon

1:19:24.237 --> 1:19:25.673
that I could really
use your help with.

1:19:25.717 --> 1:19:26.979
Holly, too, for that matter.

1:19:27.023 --> 1:19:29.199
Yeah, anything
for Lady Christmas.

1:19:29.242 --> 1:19:31.375
You guys really go back, huh?

1:19:31.418 --> 1:19:33.986
Yeah, she, um...

1:19:34.030 --> 1:19:35.596
she really helped me out.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:38.599
For a number of years there,
I was, uh, I was struggling.

1:19:38.643 --> 1:19:42.038
You know? She was the only one
who encouraged me

1:19:42.081 --> 1:19:43.909
to audition
for the Philharmonic.

1:19:43.953 --> 1:19:46.999
When I lost all faith,
she was always there.

1:19:47.043 --> 1:19:49.828
Yeah, she's a special lady,
isn't she?

1:19:49.872 --> 1:19:51.264
That's why you shouldn't
mess this up, man.

1:19:51.308 --> 1:19:53.266
Me? No.

1:19:53.310 --> 1:19:55.181
It's not like that,

1:19:55.225 --> 1:19:57.575
and, anyway,
she's not interested, so...

1:19:57.618 --> 1:20:00.796
Jack, there are many things
I know,

1:20:00.839 --> 1:20:05.148
and none more certainly
than, um...

1:20:05.191 --> 1:20:06.453
she is interested.

1:20:15.375 --> 1:20:17.856
Oh!

1:20:21.338 --> 1:20:22.861
Here we go!

1:20:31.043 --> 1:20:33.089
Merry Christmas.

1:20:33.132 --> 1:20:35.308
Merry Christmas, Jack.

1:20:36.483 --> 1:20:38.398
This is beautiful,

1:20:38.442 --> 1:20:42.185
and I don't want to sound
ungrateful, but...

1:20:42.228 --> 1:20:44.970
You need more than
a few toys?

1:20:45.014 --> 1:20:47.016
Yeah. A lot more.

1:20:47.059 --> 1:20:50.410
We invited a ton of kids, so...

1:20:50.454 --> 1:20:52.151
Oh, no.

1:20:52.195 --> 1:20:55.285
Come on in, guys!

1:20:55.328 --> 1:20:58.636
Jack! What did you do?

1:20:58.679 --> 1:21:01.769
Called some friends
to pick up donations

1:21:01.813 --> 1:21:03.902
wherever they could find them.

1:21:03.946 --> 1:21:06.296
Toys, money-- whatever
they could get their hands on.

1:21:06.339 --> 1:21:07.819
"Some" friends?

1:21:07.863 --> 1:21:10.300
Okay, everyone I know.

1:21:10.343 --> 1:21:11.736
And everyone Mac knows.

1:21:11.779 --> 1:21:14.260
And used every aspect
of my food bank network

1:21:14.304 --> 1:21:16.393
to make sure that the national
part of The Giveaway

1:21:16.436 --> 1:21:18.264
was up and running, too.

1:21:20.049 --> 1:21:21.920
This is unbelievable.

1:21:21.964 --> 1:21:24.096
And this will be happening

1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:26.707

I need to tell you.

1:22:56.580 --> 1:22:59.061
Especially if we're going
to be working together.

1:23:01.802 --> 1:23:03.239
Holly...

1:23:03.282 --> 1:23:05.502
you are the most motivated,

1:23:05.545 --> 1:23:07.460
beautiful,

1:23:07.504 --> 1:23:09.549
inspirational woman
I have ever met.

1:23:09.593 --> 1:23:12.988
Not only did you make
Christmas special for me,

1:23:13.031 --> 1:23:16.513
but you made me realize
what's missing in my life...

1:23:16.556 --> 1:23:17.993
and that's you.

1:23:21.692 --> 1:23:23.085
I'm sorry, Jack.

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:26.044
Bob already told me
of your feelings for me,

1:23:26.088 --> 1:23:28.003
and I'm really glad he did...

1:23:30.657 --> 1:23:33.660
...because I've totally fallen
for you, too.

1:23:35.706 --> 1:23:37.447
In fact...

1:23:37.490 --> 1:23:39.144
there's
another Christmas tradition

1:23:39.188 --> 1:23:41.146
I'd like to start.

1:23:58.033 --> 1:23:59.730
Merry Christmas, Jack Kane.

1:23:59.773 --> 1:24:01.340
It is now, Holly Silver.

1:24:01.384 --> 1:24:03.516
It is now.

1:24:03.560 --> 1:24:05.649
Let's go, Santa.

1:24:05.692 --> 1:24:07.085
