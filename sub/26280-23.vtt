00:02.302 --> 00:04.078
Guess I'm your new neighbor.
Penny.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.879
- Oh. Leonard. Sheldon.
- Hi.

00:05.948 --> 00:06.613
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:06.682 --> 00:08.449
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:08.517 --> 00:10.284
That's where <i>I</i> sit.

00:10.352 --> 00:11.251
Howard Wolowitz.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.953
Caltech Department
of Applied Physics.

00:13.022 --> 00:13.954
Penny?

00:14.023 --> 00:15.089
Leonard.

00:15.157 --> 00:16.490
Raj?

00:16.559 --> 00:18.270
He speaks English--
he just can't speak to women.

00:18.294 --> 00:20.027
<i>Our babies will be</i>

00:20.096 --> 00:21.495
smart <i>and</i> beautiful.

Bazinga.

00:45.621 --> 00:48.188
Welcome to the premiere episode
of <i>Sheldon Cooper Presents</i>

00:48.257 --> 00:49.656
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

00:49.725 --> 00:51.725
I'm going up in space.
Technically,

00:51.794 --> 00:53.327
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

00:53.395 --> 00:55.596
<i>Oy vey!</i>

00:56.870 --> 00:58.218
You're talking to me.

00:58.219 --> 01:00.619
I am.

01:01.989 --> 01:05.891
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

01:05.960 --> 01:08.961
We now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:09.030 --> 01:10.229
Amy?

01:10.298 --> 01:11.464
Howard?

01:11.532 --> 01:12.998
Angry Amy?

01:13.067 --> 01:14.500
I don't want you to say it

01:14.569 --> 01:16.513
just because social convention
dictates that you...

01:16.537 --> 01:17.470
I love you, too.

01:17.538 --> 01:18.871
Will you marry me?

01:18.940 --> 01:20.172
Yes.

01:20.241 --> 01:21.340
We did it!

01:21.409 --> 01:23.743
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

01:25.413 --> 01:26.712
I wonder which one's Halley.

01:30.785 --> 01:31.817
Will you marry me?

01:31.886 --> 01:32.718
<i>That...</i>

01:32.787 --> 01:35.454
means... positive?

01:35.523 --> 01:38.190
Super asymmetry, that's it!

01:38.259 --> 01:39.825
<i>Our paper was right.</i>

01:39.894 --> 01:42.294
- We did it!

Really hope

01:57.078 --> 01:58.340
you're almost to zero.

01:58.341 --> 02:00.846
No, see,
that's the beauty of half-lives:

02:00.915 --> 02:03.182
it's impossible to determine
when you'll arrive at zero.

02:03.251 --> 02:04.583
It's like
"Wheels on the Bus"

02:04.652 --> 02:07.987
if the bus had
an unknowable number of parts.

02:09.122 --> 02:10.434
Yeah, we're gonna need
more coffee.

02:10.458 --> 02:13.225
Yep. I'm with you.
Leonard, coffee?

02:13.294 --> 02:15.928
Black and strong,
like Luke Cage.

02:15.997 --> 02:18.998
I'm too tired
to even be disturbed by that.

02:19.066 --> 02:20.166
Sheldon?

02:20.234 --> 02:21.567
Mm, absolutely not, no.

02:21.636 --> 02:24.403
The Nobel committee will be
making the calls to inform

02:24.472 --> 02:26.939
the winners at any minute,
so the only drug I need

02:27.008 --> 02:28.674
is the endorphins pumping
through my brain

02:28.743 --> 02:30.509
in anticipation of our victory.

02:30.578 --> 02:32.256
Well, technically, anticipation
wouldn't be mediated

02:32.280 --> 02:34.847
by endorphins as much
as dopamine, but, you know,

02:34.916 --> 02:37.550
you've been up all night,
so I'll give you that one.

02:41.122 --> 02:44.089
Really? The second
he stops talking?

02:44.158 --> 02:46.525
Well... should we wake him up?

02:46.594 --> 02:48.661
Well, he did say
if he fell asleep,

02:48.729 --> 02:51.197
we were allowed
to slap him awake.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.866
Oh, boy.

02:54.969 --> 02:56.936
Wait a minute.
Why do you get to do it?

02:57.004 --> 02:57.692
'Cause I called it.

02:57.716 --> 02:59.716
Well, you can't just call it.
You have to earn it.

02:59.974 --> 03:01.373
Oh, and you've earned it?

03:01.442 --> 03:04.777
No one has earned it
more than me.

03:08.816 --> 03:11.717
You have your whole life
to smack him around.

03:11.752 --> 03:13.118
This is my time.

03:14.222 --> 03:16.021
Fine. Don't miss.

03:16.090 --> 03:19.325
It's not a volleyball.
I can handle it.

03:19.393 --> 03:20.693
Oh, wait. Hang on.

03:20.761 --> 03:23.262
When you're old, you are
gonna want a record of this.

03:23.331 --> 03:24.396
Oh, oh, yeah.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.466
Do it in slo-mo.
I want to see his cheeks ripple.

03:29.136 --> 03:30.503
Ready... go.

03:30.571 --> 03:32.738
It's happening!

03:32.807 --> 03:34.773
Unknown caller.
It's got to be them.

03:34.842 --> 03:36.775
Okay, put it on speaker.

03:36.844 --> 03:38.210
- Hello?
- Hi.

03:38.279 --> 03:40.746
Hello. This is Sweden calling.

03:42.984 --> 03:45.284
Is this Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler?

03:45.353 --> 03:46.519
- Yes.
- Yeah.

03:46.587 --> 03:48.354
Congratulations.

03:48.422 --> 03:51.757
It is my pleasure to inform you
that you've won the Nobel Prize

03:51.826 --> 03:53.993
in being suckers...!

03:57.732 --> 04:00.266
His Swedish accent
was very convincing.

04:02.069 --> 04:04.270
This is it!

04:04.338 --> 04:06.438
What do you want, Howard?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.440
We were just calling to see
if you'd heard yet.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.608
We haven't.

04:09.677 --> 04:10.797
But thank you for getting up

04:10.845 --> 04:11.777
so early to call.

04:11.846 --> 04:12.945
That was very thoughtful.

04:13.014 --> 04:14.414
Oh, please. We have
two little kids.

04:14.482 --> 04:16.548
We've been up for an hour.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.684
Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?

04:18.753 --> 04:20.452
No.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.053
Okay, well, call us
when you hear.

04:22.123 --> 04:24.523
All right,
now what?

04:24.592 --> 04:27.192
Oh, why don't we play a game
to pass the time?

04:27.261 --> 04:29.528
Here. Uh, I am thinking
of a number.

04:29.597 --> 04:33.098
Hint: it's a cube of a cube
of a prime.

04:33.167 --> 04:35.067
There's an infinite number
of possibilities.

04:35.136 --> 04:36.569
What, you got somewhere to be?

04:38.272 --> 04:40.806
Oh. That's me.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.241
Hello?

04:42.310 --> 04:44.843
Yes, this is Dr. Fowler.

04:46.247 --> 04:47.279
I see.

04:48.816 --> 04:50.482
Okay, thank you.

04:53.955 --> 04:55.487
We won.

05:02.797 --> 05:04.830
Congratulations!

05:04.899 --> 05:06.365
Oh, my God!

05:06.434 --> 05:08.667
- We did it.
-I know.

05:08.736 --> 05:10.169
Can you believe it?

05:10.237 --> 05:12.671
That's a good point.
What if I'm dreaming?

05:19.814 --> 05:21.480

what a fun way to look at it.

05:58.905 --> 06:00.163
I think so.

06:00.187 --> 06:01.873
You would.
That makes sense.

Ooh.

Aw. It's a congratulations text

one from my mom.

06:16.489 --> 06:19.156
Boy, they don't tell you
when you win a Nobel

06:19.225 --> 06:21.292
it chews up
your phone battery.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.394
Oh, that's me.

06:25.331 --> 06:28.199
It's CVS.
My prescription's ready.

06:28.267 --> 06:30.401
Oh, and also my dad.

06:30.469 --> 06:33.037
He says congratulations
and he loves me.

06:33.105 --> 06:34.238
Nothing about me?

06:34.307 --> 06:35.372
Oh.

06:35.441 --> 06:37.675
Oh, it's your dad. I'm good.

06:37.743 --> 06:39.710
You know, when you
think about it,

06:39.779 --> 06:41.478
now that we're Nobel
Prize winners,

06:41.547 --> 06:43.303
our names will be linked
together forever.

06:43.327 --> 06:44.282
We're married.

06:44.283 --> 06:45.928
Our names are already
linked together forever.

06:45.952 --> 06:47.952
Oh, please. That's
just a piece of paper.

06:48.020 --> 06:50.454
This is a piece of paper
and a medal.

06:51.490 --> 06:52.423
It's weird.

06:52.491 --> 06:54.225
I don't really
feel different,

06:54.293 --> 06:56.060
but I guess our lives
will never be the same.

06:56.128 --> 06:59.597
Oh, I don't know. We're
going to work like always.

06:59.665 --> 07:02.333
I still put my pants on
both legs at a time.

07:02.401 --> 07:05.769
One day that's
gonna end very badly.

07:11.844 --> 07:13.611
Congratulations.
How does it feel?

07:13.679 --> 07:16.146
Okay, w-we're happy
to answer your questions,

07:16.215 --> 07:17.815
Just, um,
one at a time, please?

07:17.883 --> 07:19.250
Dr. Cooper!

07:21.587 --> 07:22.786
Is Dr. Cooper coming back?

07:22.855 --> 07:25.055
No. Next question.

07:28.127 --> 07:30.928
Was it your left hand
or your right hand?

07:31.998 --> 07:33.464
Right.

07:33.532 --> 07:36.300
Spit actually flew
out of his mouth.

07:36.369 --> 07:38.369
Hey, fellas.

07:39.805 --> 07:41.372
Can you do me a favor?

07:41.440 --> 07:42.539
Do we have a choice?

07:42.608 --> 07:43.608
Ha-ha!

07:43.643 --> 07:44.708
No.

07:44.777 --> 07:46.443
Sheldon and Amy

07:46.512 --> 07:48.223
are now officially superstars,
and the press

07:48.247 --> 07:50.914
will be reaching out to their
family and friends for comment.

07:50.983 --> 07:53.183
So that we're all
on the same page,

07:53.252 --> 07:56.453
the word we're gonna use
to describe them is "quirky."

07:56.522 --> 07:58.922
And not <i>quirky.</i>
More like <i>quirky.</i>

07:58.991 --> 08:00.924
So not Mr. and Mrs.
Wackadoodle?

08:00.993 --> 08:02.092
Ho-ho-ho!

08:02.161 --> 08:06.163
You bitter, envious little man.

08:10.870 --> 08:12.803
Thank you so much.

08:17.276 --> 08:18.876
And what do we call that?

08:18.944 --> 08:20.678
- Quirky. - Quirky.
- Quirky.

08:23.316 --> 08:26.150
Dr. Cooper, can I get
a minute of your time?

08:27.920 --> 08:28.952
Hello?

08:29.021 --> 08:30.087
Hey.

08:30.122 --> 08:31.400
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah, actually.

08:31.424 --> 08:32.990
Um, I had an appointment

08:33.058 --> 08:35.225
to interview Dr. Cooper
about the Nobel.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.559
Hang on a second.

08:36.629 --> 08:37.629
Sheldon?

08:45.104 --> 08:47.237
Sorry, he's not here.

08:47.306 --> 08:49.440
Damn. I've got a deadline.

08:49.508 --> 08:52.009
I don't know
if it helps you at all,

08:52.078 --> 08:55.546
but I'm his best friend
in the whole world.

08:55.614 --> 08:56.914
Really?

08:56.982 --> 08:58.827
And an astronaut. Come on,
you can buy me a cup of coffee,

08:58.851 --> 09:01.318
and I'll tell
you about both.

09:09.528 --> 09:11.562
Everyone okay in there?

09:11.630 --> 09:12.996
Go away!

09:13.065 --> 09:14.798
Amy?

09:14.867 --> 09:17.401
Raj, please, not now.

09:17.470 --> 09:20.003
Hey, what's wrong?

09:20.072 --> 09:21.505
My picture's
all over the Internet,

09:21.574 --> 09:23.240
and I look terrible.

09:23.309 --> 09:24.908
No. Let me see.

09:24.977 --> 09:28.045
Well, that is
an unfortunate angle.

09:28.114 --> 09:30.147
But who cares?

09:30.216 --> 09:31.448
You just won the Nobel.

09:31.517 --> 09:33.550
You should be proud
of this moment.

09:33.619 --> 09:35.319
I know I shouldn't care
about how I look,

09:35.388 --> 09:36.820
and I never thought I did.

09:36.889 --> 09:40.190
It-It's stupid and shallow,
but I just can't help it.

09:40.259 --> 09:42.693
Am I really this frumpy?

09:42.762 --> 09:45.963
No. No, you are
a beautiful woman.

09:46.031 --> 09:47.831
By the way,
if you're not happy

09:47.900 --> 09:49.967
with those pictures,
then make some changes.

09:50.035 --> 09:52.436
Get a haircut, new clothes,

09:52.505 --> 09:54.438
new glasses, big glasses...

09:54.507 --> 09:57.107
No glasses-- then you won't
be able to see those pictures.

09:58.210 --> 10:00.043
Sounds expensive.

10:00.112 --> 10:02.613
Excuse me,
i-if I'm not mistaken,

10:02.681 --> 10:05.416
the Nobel comes with
a substantial cash prize.

10:05.484 --> 10:07.117
What were you gonna
spend it on?

10:07.186 --> 10:09.453
Hadn't really
thought about it.

10:09.522 --> 10:13.290
Sheldon's got his eyes
on some new Dockers.

10:13.359 --> 10:16.627
Come on.
Do something for yourself.

10:16.695 --> 10:19.296
Well, I suppose
I could get a haircut.

10:19.365 --> 10:22.900
And some makeup
and a new wardrobe

10:22.968 --> 10:25.035
and a little thank you gift
for your shopping buddy

10:25.104 --> 10:26.804
if we see something
he likes. Come on.

10:26.872 --> 10:28.372
Where are we going?

10:28.441 --> 10:31.475
Beverly Hills,
where the things he likes are.

10:34.914 --> 10:36.180
Dinner ready?

10:36.248 --> 10:38.182
Not unless you cooked.

10:40.219 --> 10:43.587
Why is this article
about Sheldon all about you?

10:45.391 --> 10:46.323
Let me see.

10:46.392 --> 10:49.626
Oh, good, they used
my NASA picture.

10:49.695 --> 10:52.896
Why does it say that
you're his best friend?

10:52.965 --> 10:54.164
Leonard's his best friend.

10:54.233 --> 10:55.732
No. Leonard
has always been

10:55.801 --> 10:57.868
kind of a monkey butler.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.903
Whenever Sheldon
got into a scrape,

10:59.972 --> 11:01.839
I was his go-to guy.

11:03.242 --> 11:04.541
When did he get
into a scrape?

11:04.610 --> 11:06.410
You're kidding, right?

11:06.479 --> 11:07.923
W-- Remember
when he had a panic attack

11:07.947 --> 11:09.524
'cause his hand got stuck
in a jar of olives?

11:09.548 --> 11:13.217
I was the one who told him
to let go of the olives.

11:14.553 --> 11:17.688
Please, that doesn't
make you his best friend.

11:19.091 --> 11:21.091
You know,
that reporter asked me

11:21.160 --> 11:23.427
if I could put him in touch
with...

11:23.496 --> 11:24.995
Amy's best friend.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.096
That's Penny.

11:26.165 --> 11:28.332
Doesn't have to be.

11:32.671 --> 11:34.304
Hmm.

11:34.373 --> 11:36.940
What kind of tea
is appropriate

11:37.009 --> 11:39.843
for winning a Nobel Prize
and now everything is changing

11:39.912 --> 11:43.413
and you feel unmoored
from reality?

11:43.482 --> 11:46.116
I don't know. Earl Grey?

11:46.185 --> 11:47.384
You know,

11:47.453 --> 11:49.453
this is something
I've wanted my whole life.

11:49.522 --> 11:50.921
But I guess I never considered

11:50.990 --> 11:52.456
how everything
would be different.

11:52.525 --> 11:55.058
Buddy, I-I know it all feels
overwhelming right now,

11:55.127 --> 11:57.060
but I promise you,
things will settle down.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.061
There's no Earl Grey!

11:58.130 --> 11:59.730
You filthy liar!

12:01.700 --> 12:03.634
Hey, is Penny here?

12:03.702 --> 12:04.702
No. Why?

12:04.770 --> 12:05.903
I wanted to show her

12:05.971 --> 12:07.037
my latest creation.

12:07.106 --> 12:08.572
I give you...

12:08.641 --> 12:11.508
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

12:18.517 --> 12:20.384
Wow. Amy, you
look amazing.

12:20.452 --> 12:21.752
Thank you.

12:21.787 --> 12:24.588
Sheldon, what do you think?

12:29.128 --> 12:31.461
I like you better
the way you were.

12:31.530 --> 12:34.665
But she looks
beautiful!

12:34.733 --> 12:36.667
Classic lines,

12:36.735 --> 12:38.046
colors that complement
her skin tone,

12:38.070 --> 12:42.005
and hair that goes from "office"
to "on the town" in minutes.

12:44.209 --> 12:46.577
I don't care.
Put it back.

12:46.645 --> 12:48.679
I like the way I look.

12:48.747 --> 12:51.081
Well, I don't!

12:52.484 --> 12:54.084
My fault.
I was out of Earl Grey.

12:57.489 --> 12:59.323
Sheldon, that was really rude.

12:59.391 --> 13:01.959
I'm sorry. Amy is
the one constant I can count on,

13:02.027 --> 13:03.594
and now she's changing.

13:03.662 --> 13:05.429
It's just a haircut
and some clothes.

13:05.497 --> 13:06.697
No, it's
the last straw!

13:06.765 --> 13:09.099
I can't take any more!

13:16.241 --> 13:17.507
Can you believe it?

13:17.576 --> 13:18.856
They finally fixed the elevator.

13:25.216 --> 13:27.249
This is
a nightmare.

13:27.627 --> 13:28.557
What's with him?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.791
He won a Nobel Prize,
and his wife looks amazing.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.360
Oh. Yeah, got it.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:53.282 --> 13:54.948
How did you get down here?

13:55.017 --> 13:56.683
The elevator. It's really fast.

13:58.521 --> 13:59.853
I-I need to be alone right now.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.854
Don't try to follow me.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.855
All right.
You need a ride?

14:01.924 --> 14:04.491
That'd be great.
Thank you.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.861
I should've seen this coming.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.963
Oh, stop. You're allowed
to get a haircut.

14:10.032 --> 14:11.032
I know.

14:11.066 --> 14:13.000
But I should've done it
gradually.

14:13.068 --> 14:16.603
You know, like...

14:16.672 --> 14:20.774
maybe 300 tiny haircuts
over a ten-year period.

14:21.977 --> 14:24.645
Okay, you need to
focus on the positive.

14:24.713 --> 14:26.847
You won a Nobel Prize.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.048
I slapped Sheldon.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.851
A lot of dreams
came true today.

14:31.887 --> 14:34.021
You know, you're right.

14:34.089 --> 14:35.956
This is a huge day for me,

14:36.025 --> 14:37.558
and I'm allowed to enjoy it

14:37.626 --> 14:40.260
without worrying how
it's going to affect my husband.

14:40.329 --> 14:41.862
Is it me

14:41.931 --> 14:45.199
or did it just
get fierce in here?

14:48.437 --> 14:51.505
All this change
is just too much.

14:51.574 --> 14:53.607
The reporters,

14:53.676 --> 14:54.875
the attention at work,

14:54.944 --> 14:56.543
and now even Amy's changed.

14:56.612 --> 14:58.078
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.913
- Slow down.
- I'm playing a drinking game.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.448
Every time you say
the word "change,"

15:01.517 --> 15:03.750
I take a slug.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.286
Are you gonna be able
to drive me home?

15:06.355 --> 15:08.288
Mm. Not unless you
change the subject.

15:08.357 --> 15:10.624
Huh. Now I said it.

15:10.693 --> 15:12.626
Meh. Hmm.

15:15.965 --> 15:17.742
You know, you're the
only person who could win

15:17.766 --> 15:20.567
the biggest prize in science
and still be upset about it.

15:20.636 --> 15:21.735
It's just...

15:21.804 --> 15:23.737
all the times
I thought about winning,

15:23.806 --> 15:25.372
I never thought
about how it would ch--

15:25.441 --> 15:28.208
affect my life.

15:29.645 --> 15:31.878
I'm sorry, I'm genuinely
concerned about your liver.

15:31.947 --> 15:33.080
Okay.

15:33.148 --> 15:35.882
Fine, I'll stop playing.

15:35.951 --> 15:38.263
You know, you go on and on about
wanting things to stay the same,

15:38.287 --> 15:40.487
but you've changed a
lot since I met you.

15:40.556 --> 15:43.423
Oh, you are a mean drunk.

15:43.492 --> 15:44.691
I'm serious.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.426
You have a ton of friends,

15:46.495 --> 15:49.096
you got married, moved
into a new apartment,

15:49.164 --> 15:51.365
you wore a baseball
hat that one time.

15:51.433 --> 15:55.969
Heck, you've had sex almost as
many times as I have fingers.

15:57.306 --> 15:58.238
More.

15:58.307 --> 15:59.239
W...

15:59.308 --> 16:00.907
By this many.

16:00.976 --> 16:02.576
You dog!

16:02.645 --> 16:03.722
It was the <i>Avengers</i> trailer.

16:03.746 --> 16:04.678
Oh.

16:04.747 --> 16:06.079
Mm-hmm.

16:06.148 --> 16:07.726
You know, I've grown, too.
I used to be the bartender

16:07.750 --> 16:09.316
back there.
- That's true.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.029
And now there is
a completely different woman

16:11.053 --> 16:12.719
who botched my drink order.

16:12.788 --> 16:15.589
How hard is 65% Coke,
35% Diet Coke?

16:16.692 --> 16:18.458
Well, judging
by the look on her face,

16:18.527 --> 16:20.794
it's at least
one percent saliva.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.066
I do take your point.

16:26.135 --> 16:27.467
You know,
you're also married,

16:27.536 --> 16:30.203
you have a successful career,
you no longer dress

16:30.272 --> 16:34.174
like you're trying
to attract sailors by the wharf.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.644
So, I guess the only thing
that actually stays the same

16:37.713 --> 16:39.780
is that things are
always changing.

16:40.883 --> 16:42.949
Interesting.

16:43.018 --> 16:46.553
So you're saying
the inevitability of change

16:46.622 --> 16:49.022
might be
a universal constant.

16:49.091 --> 16:52.859
Well, there's a little more to
it than that, but, yeah, sure.

16:52.928 --> 16:55.696
Oh. Hey, look,
that's Bernadette.

16:55.764 --> 16:59.900
I can't tell you how many times
Dr. Fowler was gonna give up

16:59.968 --> 17:00.968
and I would say to her,

17:01.036 --> 17:03.337
"Amy, as your best friend,

17:03.372 --> 17:05.372
I'm not gonna let you quit."

17:05.441 --> 17:07.840
Okay, I'm drinking again.

17:07.910 --> 17:09.142
I'll join you.
Waitress,

17:09.211 --> 17:11.912
uh, 95% Hawaiian Punch,
five percent vodka.

17:11.980 --> 17:12.913
Let me tell you about the time

17:12.981 --> 17:14.981
Mr. Nobel Laureate
wanted olives...

17:15.050 --> 17:17.483
This is a good one.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.353
You know what, 90/10!

17:22.624 --> 17:25.358
You know, I like
the way my hair looks.

17:25.426 --> 17:27.394
I'm done tiptoeing
around him.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.729
We're all guilty of it.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.530
But why?

17:30.599 --> 17:31.998
'Cause we were afraid
to upset him.

17:32.067 --> 17:32.999
Which happens anyway.

17:33.068 --> 17:34.868
Well, that's over.

17:34.937 --> 17:36.837
I'm-I'm done enabling him.
Like,

17:36.905 --> 17:37.905
this is his spot

17:37.973 --> 17:40.741
and-and the thermostat
has to be set

17:40.809 --> 17:42.209
to <i>his</i> comfort level,

17:42.277 --> 17:43.621
even though he doesn't
even live here anymore

17:43.645 --> 17:46.513
and I'm always chilly.

17:47.616 --> 17:51.184
Is that why you wear
a hoodie all the time?

17:52.287 --> 17:54.788
Why would-- Yes!

17:54.857 --> 17:57.391
To accommodate
Sheldon!

17:57.459 --> 17:58.859
And what-what
about this-this thing?

17:58.894 --> 18:01.094
Why is it here?
I'll tell you why.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.474
Because it was here
when I moved in,

18:02.498 --> 18:04.097
and, for no earthly reason,

18:04.166 --> 18:06.566
he forbade me to touch it.

18:06.635 --> 18:07.768
Well, if you don't like it,

18:07.836 --> 18:09.269
get rid of it.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.071
Put it in the closet.

18:11.140 --> 18:13.140
You know what,

18:13.208 --> 18:15.509
I will.

18:22.117 --> 18:25.018
I bet that's the reason.

18:31.393 --> 18:33.326
Hang on.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.465
What do you think?

18:38.534 --> 18:39.534
Want to give it a try?

18:53.482 --> 18:54.748
Well, you know,

18:54.817 --> 18:57.551
the elevator did work
when I moved into the building.

18:57.619 --> 19:00.554
So going up and down the stairs
was a change,

19:00.622 --> 19:03.957
which means this would actually
be a return to the status quo.

19:04.026 --> 19:05.546
- But, conversely, I think...
- Get in!

19:12.367 --> 19:14.768
This is wild.

19:18.042 --> 19:22.742

19:26.636 --> 19:27.936
Hydrogen.

19:30.373 --> 19:31.906
Carbon.

19:33.844 --> 19:35.176
Carbon.

19:36.747 --> 19:38.146
And last but not least,

19:38.215 --> 19:39.414
carbon.

19:40.884 --> 19:42.717
This might be the glue talking,

19:42.786 --> 19:46.454
but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

19:46.523 --> 19:47.523
Agreed.

19:47.557 --> 19:49.657
What kind of DNA
is this, anyway?

19:49.726 --> 19:51.659
I was trying to design
the genetic code

19:51.728 --> 19:53.661
of an advanced race
of human being.

19:53.730 --> 19:55.414
One of my rare failures,
actually.

19:55.438 --> 19:56.265
What went wrong?

19:56.266 --> 19:59.067
The balls kept
sticking to my pants.

19:59.136 --> 20:02.203
Let's just let it dry.

20:02.272 --> 20:03.671
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hey, babe.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.017
Oh, don't slam the...
Don't slam the...

20:09.312 --> 20:11.546
That was exhilarating.

20:12.949 --> 20:14.716
- You pick up your dresses?
- Yep.

20:14.785 --> 20:17.185
The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

20:17.254 --> 20:19.220
Best day of my life.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.724
What about the day you met me?

20:22.793 --> 20:25.627
I stand by my statement.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.562
Well, thank you guys so much
for the clothes

20:27.631 --> 20:28.997
and the shoes,
the plane tickets.

20:29.065 --> 20:30.365
You've been so generous.

20:30.433 --> 20:32.044
Well, it's important
that all of our friends

20:32.068 --> 20:33.535
get to share
this moment with us.

20:33.603 --> 20:35.470
And then for years to come,
you can tell others

20:35.539 --> 20:36.883
you had a front-row
seat to history.

20:36.907 --> 20:37.972
Although, technically,

20:38.041 --> 20:41.075
I think your seats are
in the second row.

20:41.144 --> 20:43.878
Do you want to go back to the apartment
and see me try on my dress?

20:43.914 --> 20:46.192
Shouldn't I see it for the first
time at the Nobel ceremony?

20:46.216 --> 20:47.615
It's not a wedding.

20:47.684 --> 20:48.995
Okay. Well, give me
a minute to think

20:49.019 --> 20:50.619
of another reason I
don't want to see it.

20:51.788 --> 20:53.833
How about this-- you can
practice your acceptance speech

20:53.857 --> 20:55.223
while I try on the dress.

20:55.292 --> 20:58.793
Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.201
Was Amy suspicious when
they had to let your dress out?

21:06.269 --> 21:09.904
No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

21:09.973 --> 21:12.110
Someone's gonna figure it out.
Why don't we just tell people?

21:12.134 --> 21:13.008
No, it's too early.

21:13.009 --> 21:14.059
I haven't even wrapped
my head around it.

21:14.060 --> 21:17.212
- I have. My head is wrapped.
- Yeah, well...

21:17.280 --> 21:20.782
if something else had been wrapped,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

21:20.851 --> 21:24.686
Excuse me, but if I recall, you're the one
who went out drinking with Sheldon,

21:24.754 --> 21:26.387
then came home and attacked me.

21:26.456 --> 21:28.957
Attacked you? I said,
"Do you wanna?"

21:29.025 --> 21:30.425
Yeah.

21:30.493 --> 21:33.194
- I was helpless.
-Uh-huh.

21:33.263 --> 21:34.963
So...

21:35.031 --> 21:38.166
do you wanna?

21:38.235 --> 21:40.568
- Well, I can't get more pregnant.
- Mm-hmm.

21:40.637 --> 21:41.204
We'll see about that.

Now, Michael, Mommy and Daddy

22:08.751 --> 22:10.518
are going away
for a couple days,

22:10.587 --> 22:12.131
so if you're gonna say
your first words,

22:12.155 --> 22:14.689
you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

22:17.093 --> 22:18.726
Somebody just peed

22:18.795 --> 22:20.761
in the big girl potty.

22:20.830 --> 22:22.763
Oh, I'm so proud!

22:22.832 --> 22:24.665
It was her, right?

22:24.734 --> 22:25.867
Yes.

22:25.935 --> 22:28.169
You still feel good
about leaving them

22:28.238 --> 22:30.972
with Stuart and Denise
for a couple days?

22:31.040 --> 22:34.342
I guess. I just hope we don't
miss Michael's first words.

22:34.410 --> 22:36.410
Or Stuart's last words.

22:36.479 --> 22:38.312
You realize it's been years

22:38.381 --> 22:40.882
since we've got away
just the two of us.

22:40.950 --> 22:43.151
I know. I can't wait.

22:43.219 --> 22:46.154
Fancy hotel room.
The big bed.

22:46.222 --> 22:49.824
Yeah. We're gonna
sleep our asses off.

22:53.029 --> 22:54.729
You really think walking her

22:54.797 --> 22:56.497
is gonna help me meet girls?

22:56.566 --> 22:58.599
Cinnamon is chick bait.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.501
Good. 'Cause I'm not.

23:00.570 --> 23:01.903
Just remember,

23:01.971 --> 23:03.771
you're in charge.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.473
Don't let her pull <i>you.</i>

23:07.310 --> 23:11.179
That seems like
an unnecessary thing to say.

23:11.247 --> 23:14.081
And please, if you have
any problems, any questions,

23:14.150 --> 23:15.650
call me immediately, okay?

23:15.718 --> 23:17.618
She's my baby.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.687
It shouldn't come up,
but just in case:

23:19.756 --> 23:22.890
where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

23:24.527 --> 23:27.261
Kidding. If she dies,
I'll just tell you.

23:29.699 --> 23:30.898
Ready?

23:30.967 --> 23:32.333
Oh. Hang on.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.305
Go.

23:37.373 --> 23:38.484
"Your majesties, members
of the Nobel Academy--

23:38.508 --> 23:40.186
"when I was a young boy
growing up in East Texas

23:40.210 --> 23:41.620
"I always knew
I'd wind up on this stage,

23:41.644 --> 23:42.922
"and everybody
who said I wouldn't looks

23:42.946 --> 23:44.657
"pretty darn foolish right now.
I'm talking about you,

23:44.681 --> 23:45.886
high school science teacher
Mr. Hubert Givens..."

23:45.887 --> 23:49.116
Sheldon, Sheldon.
Why are you talking so fast?

23:49.185 --> 23:51.953
I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

23:52.021 --> 23:54.855
Nobody's gonna be able to
understand a word you're saying.

23:54.924 --> 23:57.225
Welcome to my life.

23:57.293 --> 23:59.694
I think you need
to do some editing,

23:59.762 --> 24:02.330
like maybe cut out all
that stuff about your childhood.

24:02.398 --> 24:05.266
Are you kidding? Growing up
in the backwoods of East Texas

24:05.335 --> 24:08.836
is what makes me warm
and relatable.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.238
Well, what about all these pages

24:10.306 --> 24:12.406
calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

24:12.475 --> 24:14.542
I told them all
they would rue the day.

24:14.611 --> 24:17.411
How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

24:17.480 --> 24:19.080
and they're not filled with rue?

24:19.148 --> 24:21.816
Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

24:21.884 --> 24:23.551
This is about...

24:23.620 --> 24:25.820
humbly accepting
a great honor.

24:25.888 --> 24:28.556
Amy, we won the Nobel
Prize in Physics.

24:28.625 --> 24:31.459
Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels

24:31.527 --> 24:34.729
like Literature,
Economics and Peace.

24:34.797 --> 24:37.331
Please tell me that's
not in your speech.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.801
Oh. I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

24:43.806 --> 24:46.907
All right, bagels down.
Before we head to the airport,

24:46.976 --> 24:48.309
I'd like to go over
a few things.

24:50.079 --> 24:52.380
From the moment we
step off the plane,

24:52.448 --> 24:54.849
each and every one of you
is an ambassador

24:54.917 --> 24:56.350
for Amy and myself.

24:56.419 --> 24:59.120
I told you
these tickets weren't free.

24:59.188 --> 25:02.690
As such, your behavior must
reflect the highest standards.

25:02.759 --> 25:05.559
Uh, Raj. Bagel down.

25:05.628 --> 25:09.397
If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

25:09.465 --> 25:11.299
Amy, why don't you
kick us off.

25:11.367 --> 25:12.533
Thank you.

25:12.602 --> 25:14.902
"The challenging
climate of Scandinavia

25:14.971 --> 25:17.772
"has left its mark on
the Swedish character.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.808
"These dour,
latter-day Vikings

25:20.877 --> 25:22.777
"are slow to warm up
to strangers,

25:22.845 --> 25:24.812
"but if you follow
a few easy steps,

25:24.881 --> 25:27.381
a Swede can be your
friend for life."

25:27.450 --> 25:28.883
"Number one,

25:28.951 --> 25:32.119
"in Sweden, punctuality
is taken very seriously.

25:32.188 --> 25:34.722
"In other words, the loosey-goosey
attitude in Helsinki

25:34.791 --> 25:36.924
will not fly in Stockholm."

25:36.993 --> 25:38.659
"Two, at the beginning

25:38.728 --> 25:41.095
"and end of all business
and social meetings,

25:41.164 --> 25:42.797
"shake hands with
everyone present--

25:42.865 --> 25:44.398
men, women and children."

25:44.467 --> 25:46.512
Yes, you're all encouraged
to pair off and practice this

25:46.536 --> 25:49.437
once we're in the air
and the seat belt sign is off.

25:49.505 --> 25:51.238
Yes, Penny?
Oh.

25:51.307 --> 25:53.040
Do we have to go?

25:54.944 --> 25:57.044
Yes. And a reminder, Penny,
there's free alcohol

25:57.113 --> 25:58.913
in business class--
don't abuse it.

25:58.981 --> 26:00.548
Relax. I'm not gonna drink.

26:00.616 --> 26:03.417
Why? You pregnant?
Wha...? No.

26:03.486 --> 26:04.719
No, I just, you know,

26:04.787 --> 26:07.088
I don't like to
drink when I fly.

26:07.156 --> 26:09.657
Please. I've seen you
drink in the shower.

26:12.428 --> 26:14.128
You guys have
showered together?

26:18.868 --> 26:20.701
Sometimes
you're just...

26:20.770 --> 26:22.436
ech.

26:23.539 --> 26:25.740
That wasn't a no.

26:25.808 --> 26:26.941
All right,

26:27.009 --> 26:28.849
well, we should head out now
if we're gonna get

26:28.878 --> 26:30.611
to the airport
six hours before boarding.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.381
Excuse me. Hello?
What did we

26:33.449 --> 26:35.816
just learn about the end
of business meetings?

26:35.885 --> 26:37.284
Oh, my God.

26:39.622 --> 26:42.056
Yeah, great. Whatever. Uh-huh.

26:43.526 --> 26:44.992
Go on.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.660
You first. Go.

26:48.631 --> 26:49.764
Wait.

26:49.832 --> 26:51.031
Help me!
Oh.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.401
Help me!
Oh, wait. Come here.

26:53.469 --> 26:54.780
- We got this.
- Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.305
Hang on.

26:58.374 --> 27:00.107
I've-I've got an idea.

27:05.882 --> 27:08.582
Well done. You know,
you're proving to be

27:08.651 --> 27:11.385
an invaluable part
of my entourage.

27:11.454 --> 27:12.653
Cool.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.167
Yeah?

27:26.235 --> 27:28.202
- How you doing?
- Fine. Why?

27:28.271 --> 27:31.338
Well, this is the furthest we've
ever been away from the kids.

27:31.407 --> 27:34.008
I was just checking to see
if you're okay.

27:34.076 --> 27:37.344
I'm on my second Jack Reacher.
I'm doing great.

27:37.413 --> 27:38.612
Good. Me, too.

27:38.681 --> 27:40.014
I was just looking
at the map.

27:40.082 --> 27:41.482
Couldn't help
thinking: we're here

27:41.551 --> 27:44.185
and they're there, and
if anything happened,

27:44.253 --> 27:47.888
we'd have to go here to get
all the way back there.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.890
Why are you trying
to freak me out?

27:49.959 --> 27:51.025
This is our vacation.

27:51.093 --> 27:54.161
I thought we should
do things together.

27:54.230 --> 27:56.197
Howard, the kids are okay.

27:56.265 --> 27:57.198
How do you know that?

27:57.266 --> 27:59.633
I just know.
A mother knows.

27:59.702 --> 28:03.037
So what,
now the Force is with you?

28:03.105 --> 28:04.438
Let's see.

28:04.507 --> 28:07.608
This is not the woman
you want to annoy.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.312
- Howard. Howard.
- What?

28:11.380 --> 28:14.048
You see the woman
sitting next to me?

28:14.116 --> 28:15.549
What about her?

28:15.618 --> 28:17.151
Is this her?

28:18.788 --> 28:21.288
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

28:21.357 --> 28:22.957
Shh! Be cool.

28:25.027 --> 28:27.194
- No, that's not her.
- Okay.

28:27.263 --> 28:29.196
How about now?

28:32.869 --> 28:34.535
Uh-oh.

28:39.742 --> 28:42.109
That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

28:42.178 --> 28:43.744
in the last two hours.

28:43.813 --> 28:45.579
So?

28:45.648 --> 28:48.749
Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

28:49.819 --> 28:52.219
- So?
- So she clearly has

28:52.288 --> 28:53.721
some sort of
stomach distress.

28:53.789 --> 28:55.589
If it's viral, we're
all susceptible.

28:55.658 --> 28:57.491
She's probably just airsick.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.360
Yeah, but what
if she's not?

28:59.428 --> 29:00.828
What if we get
what she has?

29:00.897 --> 29:02.830
What if we infect
the King of Sweden?

29:02.899 --> 29:04.465
That's how wars start.

29:10.072 --> 29:13.307
All right, that's it, this is <i>Outbreak</i>
and she's the monkey.

29:14.610 --> 29:15.976
Wait. Stop.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.712
Be reasonable.

29:18.781 --> 29:20.247
Leonard...

29:20.316 --> 29:22.616
we need to do something
about your wife.

29:22.685 --> 29:24.229
- What's the matter?
- She is clearly sick,

29:24.253 --> 29:25.388
and she's gonna take us
all down with her.

29:25.412 --> 29:26.988
She's not sick, Sheldon.

29:26.989 --> 29:28.355
She is, and I'm
gonna catch it,

29:28.424 --> 29:30.457
and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

29:30.526 --> 29:33.360
I promise you're not going
to get what she has.

29:33.429 --> 29:34.495
What's going on?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.530
Unclean! Unclean!

29:36.599 --> 29:38.065
What?

29:38.134 --> 29:39.633
He thinks you're sick.

29:39.702 --> 29:41.035
Oh.

29:41.103 --> 29:42.836
Should we tell him?

29:42.905 --> 29:44.371
Well, if we don't,
he might try

29:44.440 --> 29:45.760
and jump out of the plane.
- Yeah.

29:45.808 --> 29:47.308
Doesn't answer my question.

29:47.376 --> 29:49.810
Tell me what?

29:49.879 --> 29:52.413
I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

29:52.481 --> 29:54.782
You're right,
I can't catch that.

29:59.722 --> 30:01.021
Good news, Amy.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.556
She's just pregnant.

30:08.904 --> 30:10.637
Are you kidding me?

30:10.705 --> 30:13.606
You just found out that a woman
who has loved and cared for you

30:13.675 --> 30:16.409
for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

30:16.478 --> 30:18.745
you're relieved that she's
not gonna get you sick?

30:18.814 --> 30:20.814
There's no need
for a recap.

30:20.882 --> 30:22.248
I was there.

30:23.985 --> 30:26.686
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anybody.

30:26.755 --> 30:28.621
I'm not anybody.
I'm your best friend.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.824
- What's going on?
- She's pregnant.

30:30.892 --> 30:32.125
That's fantastic!

30:32.194 --> 30:34.594
Why didn't you tell me?

30:34.663 --> 30:36.729
She didn't tell
me, either.

30:36.798 --> 30:38.231
But I'm her best friend.

30:38.300 --> 30:41.434
We'll get
into that later.

30:41.503 --> 30:44.103
What happened to "I'm
never gonna have kids"?

30:44.172 --> 30:46.506
It was an accident. I went out
drinking with Sheldon.

30:46.575 --> 30:48.708
Oh, my gosh.

30:48.777 --> 30:51.077
We're sister wives?

30:51.146 --> 30:53.580
No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

30:53.648 --> 30:55.448
- While fantasizing about...
- Leonard.

30:55.517 --> 30:57.684
And a little Idris Elba.

30:57.752 --> 30:59.018
- I mean, ah...
- Oh, yeah.

31:01.089 --> 31:02.589
What would you like me to say?

31:02.657 --> 31:04.257
How about congratulating us?

31:04.326 --> 31:06.259
Are congratulations
even in order?

31:06.328 --> 31:08.228
I didn't think
Penny wanted children.

31:08.296 --> 31:10.374
Well, she didn't, now she
does. And just so you know,

31:10.398 --> 31:11.509
we weren't gonna tell anybody

31:11.533 --> 31:13.399
so we wouldn't
upstage your big day.

31:13.468 --> 31:15.535
Oh, please,
you couldn't upstage us.

31:15.604 --> 31:16.836
We won a Nobel Prize.

31:16.905 --> 31:18.605
Any idiot can have a baby.

31:18.673 --> 31:20.139
Hey. What's going on?

31:20.208 --> 31:21.708
Case in point.

31:23.778 --> 31:25.745
You are a selfish jerk.

31:25.814 --> 31:27.614
To hell with you and
your Nobel Prize.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.851
I found her boarding pass
in her purse.

31:31.887 --> 31:33.119
It's totally her.

31:36.992 --> 31:38.725
Hi, Stuart, just checking in.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.360
Seeing if everything's okay.

31:40.395 --> 31:42.762
Oh, yeah, we're having fun.

31:42.831 --> 31:46.633
Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.

31:46.701 --> 31:48.801
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

31:48.870 --> 31:51.271
I found Denise right away.

31:52.340 --> 31:54.574
Where was Halley hiding?

31:54.643 --> 31:58.678
Uh, the important thing
is she's not there now.

31:58.747 --> 32:01.114
Okay, so, everyone's
happy and healthy?

32:01.182 --> 32:02.749
Well, that depends.

32:02.817 --> 32:03.917
What's that mean?

32:03.985 --> 32:05.885
Uh, how many teeth

32:05.954 --> 32:08.121
did Halley have when you left?

32:08.189 --> 32:09.956
All of them.

32:10.025 --> 32:14.127
Oh, yeah, that's-that's
what I was afraid of.

32:14.195 --> 32:15.528
What happened?

32:15.597 --> 32:17.196
Um, well, all right.

32:17.265 --> 32:20.300
Um, Michael had a little fever
last night.

32:20.368 --> 32:21.768
Michael had a fever?

32:21.836 --> 32:23.703
Do you want to hear about Halley
or not?

32:23.772 --> 32:25.171
What happened, Stuart?

32:25.240 --> 32:27.974
He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.

32:28.043 --> 32:30.343
And Halley, bless her heart,

32:30.412 --> 32:32.211
wanted to bring him
his boo-boo bear,

32:32.280 --> 32:34.614
so she climbed
over the safety rail

32:34.683 --> 32:38.217
and took a little tumble
down the stairs.

32:38.286 --> 32:40.386
She fell down the stairs?!

32:40.455 --> 32:43.222
She rolled down the stairs,

32:43.291 --> 32:45.358
laughing the whole time.

32:45.427 --> 32:46.926
Anyway,
when she got to the bottom,

32:46.995 --> 32:49.228
there was a tooth missing.

32:49.297 --> 32:50.297
Oh, Stuart!

32:50.332 --> 32:51.531
She's fine!

32:51.599 --> 32:53.900
She thought it was funny.

32:53.969 --> 32:56.502
Did you at least save
it for the tooth fairy?

32:56.571 --> 32:58.504
No, we couldn't find it.

32:58.573 --> 33:00.173
We have a theory

33:00.241 --> 33:01.641
about where it is,
but it'll take

33:01.710 --> 33:04.677
six to eight hours to confirm.

33:04.746 --> 33:06.679
Speaking of which,

33:06.748 --> 33:09.849
where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?

33:13.421 --> 33:15.621
Come on, you didn't
seriously expect him to react

33:15.690 --> 33:17.023
like a normal human being.

33:17.092 --> 33:18.591
No, but still,

33:18.660 --> 33:20.593
a-after all these years,

33:20.662 --> 33:22.062
after all the crap
I've put up with,

33:22.097 --> 33:23.563
you'd think just this once

33:23.631 --> 33:25.665
he'd care
about someone else's feelings.

33:25.734 --> 33:27.533
- Oh, my God!
- What?

33:27.602 --> 33:29.936
Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

33:30.005 --> 33:31.537
Really?

33:31.606 --> 33:33.873
Sounds gross.
Looks gross. Smells gross.

33:33.942 --> 33:36.209
It's delicious!

33:37.512 --> 33:40.913
Ooh, that might
be my salted cod!

33:43.318 --> 33:44.450
What?

33:44.519 --> 33:46.853
Sheldon has something
he'd like to say.

33:46.921 --> 33:48.221
I'm sorry I didn't

33:48.289 --> 33:49.455
react appropriately.

33:49.524 --> 33:51.524
You and Penny are bringing
new life into the world.

33:51.559 --> 33:53.593
Congratulations. I
can't wait to meet it.

33:53.661 --> 33:55.962
- "It"?
- That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

33:56.031 --> 33:58.564
If you're offended, take it
up with the English language.

33:59.601 --> 34:02.101
Oh, good, you're here.
Listen,

34:02.170 --> 34:05.471
we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

34:05.540 --> 34:06.773
- Why?
- We just can't

34:06.841 --> 34:08.081
be this far away from the kids.

34:08.109 --> 34:10.109
Bernie's having a meltdown,

34:10.178 --> 34:11.944
- and, frankly, so am I.
- Yeah, well,

34:12.013 --> 34:14.013
pull it together. This
is a big day for me.

34:15.483 --> 34:19.018
Yeah,
I wasn't sure what to do.

34:19.087 --> 34:21.809
Now I am. We're going home.

34:21.810 --> 34:22.820
- We'll join you.
- Oh, wait.

34:22.821 --> 34:23.824
Do I get a vote in this?

34:23.848 --> 34:25.579
They'll have pickled herring
on the plane.

34:25.580 --> 34:26.712
Bye-bye.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.217
Well, I hate to say it,

34:31.286 --> 34:34.420
but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

34:34.489 --> 34:38.724
Well, you would be the authority
on the subject.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.060
What does that mean?

34:42.163 --> 34:45.063
Sheldon,
no one is happier than I am

34:45.132 --> 34:46.732
to win the Nobel.

34:46.801 --> 34:49.869
But it's not more important
than our friends.

34:49.938 --> 34:53.940
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?

34:54.007 --> 34:55.574
They're abandoning us

34:55.643 --> 34:57.877
because you broke
their hearts.

35:00.982 --> 35:03.082
- I didn't mean to.
- I know!

35:03.151 --> 35:05.985
You never mean to.

35:07.088 --> 35:08.254
That's the only reason

35:08.323 --> 35:10.022
people tolerate you!

35:12.126 --> 35:13.726
Does that include you?

35:15.797 --> 35:18.231
Sometimes, yeah.

35:27.942 --> 35:30.977
Okay, that's it for the fish.

35:31.079 --> 35:32.089
We'll be back with the meatballs

35:32.113 --> 35:34.480
after a short word
from our sponsor.

35:34.515 --> 35:37.083
Oh, thank you.

35:39.687 --> 35:42.355
Leonard, I can't go home.

35:42.423 --> 35:44.924
- I have to be there for Amy.
- Yeah.

35:44.993 --> 35:46.826
I was thinking that, too.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.494
As angry as I am at Sheldon,

35:48.563 --> 35:50.830
I still want to see him win
that medal.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.398
It's so strange.

35:52.467 --> 35:55.835
No matter how thoughtless
and selfish he is,

35:55.904 --> 35:58.237
I still love him.

35:58.306 --> 35:59.639
If you think about it,

35:59.707 --> 36:02.108
he has kind of been
our practice kid.

36:03.177 --> 36:05.077
Like when you make pancakes

36:05.146 --> 36:08.247
and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

36:08.316 --> 36:11.484
The university prefers "quirky."

36:15.757 --> 36:16.989
Hello.

36:17.058 --> 36:18.257
Hey. It's Howard.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.993
Oh, us, too.

36:21.062 --> 36:23.095
- Wait, what?
- They're gonna stay.

36:23.164 --> 36:25.631
The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.366
Really?

36:27.435 --> 36:29.468
Oh, poor little guy.

36:29.537 --> 36:30.703
Is Michael okay?

36:30.772 --> 36:31.871
Yeah, it's Stuart.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.620
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

36:36.511 --> 36:38.110
Yeah. Okay,
we'll meet you in the lobby.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.228
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?

36:44.252 --> 36:46.852
Oh, I just need, like,
five or ten minutes.

36:46.921 --> 36:49.855
- Really?
- No. What is wrong with you?!

36:52.293 --> 36:54.961
And in the field of physics,

36:55.029 --> 36:57.330
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler

36:57.398 --> 36:59.565
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

36:59.634 --> 37:02.601
for their discovery
of super-asymmetry.

37:14.215 --> 37:16.749
Just to be clear,
this isn't a date.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.184
Yeah, I know.

37:18.252 --> 37:20.653
Then why are you
holding my hand?

37:22.724 --> 37:24.690
Thank you, your majesties.

37:24.759 --> 37:27.326
Thank you
to the Nobel Committee.

37:27.395 --> 37:29.996
We are deeply honored.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.165
I would just like
to take this moment

37:33.234 --> 37:35.434
to say to all the young girls
out there

37:35.503 --> 37:38.904
who dream about science
as a profession:

37:38.973 --> 37:40.539
go for it.

37:40.608 --> 37:43.242
It is the greatest job

37:43.311 --> 37:45.878
in the world.

37:45.947 --> 37:49.482
And if anybody tells you
you can't, don't listen.

37:52.286 --> 37:54.220
And now,

37:54.288 --> 37:57.390
speaking of not listening,

37:57.458 --> 37:59.859
my husband,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

38:00.962 --> 38:02.261
Sheldon.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.765
What? Did you finish? Great job.

38:08.469 --> 38:10.403
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.573
I have a very long

38:14.642 --> 38:18.110
and somewhat self-centered
speech here.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.313
But I'd like to set it aside.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.526
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

38:27.455 --> 38:31.390
Because this honor
doesn't just belong to me.

38:32.827 --> 38:34.760
I wouldn't be up here
if it weren't

38:34.829 --> 38:38.230
for some very important people
in my life.

38:38.299 --> 38:42.668
Beginning with my mother,
father, meemaw,

38:42.737 --> 38:45.171
brother and sister.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.575
And my other family,

38:49.644 --> 38:52.044
who I'm so happy
to have here with us.

38:53.147 --> 38:55.614
Is that Buffy the
Vampire Slayer?

39:02.090 --> 39:04.490
I was under a misapprehension

39:04.559 --> 39:08.227
that my accomplishments
were mine alone.

39:10.331 --> 39:12.264
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

39:13.367 --> 39:15.534
I have been

39:15.603 --> 39:18.204
encouraged, sustained,

39:18.272 --> 39:21.841
inspired and tolerated

39:21.909 --> 39:25.111
not only by my wife,

39:25.179 --> 39:28.147
but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

39:30.852 --> 39:33.619
I'd like to ask them to stand.

39:35.423 --> 39:37.456
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.096
Dr. Bernadette
Rostenkowski Wolowitz.

39:48.035 --> 39:50.469
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

39:54.442 --> 39:58.577
And my two dearest friends
in the world,

39:58.646 --> 40:00.679
Penny Hofstadter...

40:05.720 --> 40:08.354
...and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.694
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

40:15.763 --> 40:19.899
He said to me that their babies
would be smart <i>and</i> beautiful.

40:21.969 --> 40:23.903
And now that they're expecting,

40:23.971 --> 40:26.172
I have no doubt that
that will be the case.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.241
Thanks, Sheldon. I-I haven't
told my parents yet, but thanks.

40:30.745 --> 40:33.746
Oh. I'm sorry.

40:34.849 --> 40:36.315
Don't tell anyone
that last thing.

40:36.384 --> 40:38.250
That's a secret.

40:39.320 --> 40:42.021
Howard, Bernadette,

40:42.089 --> 40:46.292
Raj, Penny, Leonard,

40:46.360 --> 40:50.329
I apologize if I haven't
been the friend you deserve.

40:51.432 --> 40:53.265
But I want you to know

40:53.334 --> 40:56.869
in my way,

40:56.938 --> 40:59.438
I love you all.

41:02.810 --> 41:04.176
And I love you.

41:08.115 --> 41:09.648
Thank you.
