WEBVTT

00:04.254 --> 00:06.381
(police radio chatter)

00:13.430 --> 00:15.265
-Let's see IDs here.
-Is that Leyton?

00:15.473 --> 00:16.307
Was.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.144
Where's the man who shot him,
his partner? What's his name?

00:19.227 --> 00:20.061
Gann.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.106
-Night shift?
-Task force.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.024
Anti-crack.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.485
Yeah, he says they observed
a suspect heading up the alley,

00:27.569 --> 00:30.113
and Leyton circled around.
Gann was jumpy. He shot.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.533
(car engine starts)

00:37.704 --> 00:38.872
I'm Captain Furillo.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.917
I screwed up, man.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.504
(voice breaking) I screwed up.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.507
How long were you partners?

00:49.591 --> 00:50.884
Eighteen months.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.429
It's no secret I didn't like the dude.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.848
He was a pretty boy.
He dressed like a pimp.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.099
You know how they are.

00:58.516 --> 00:59.350
They?

01:01.269 --> 01:02.187
But I didn't mean to kill him.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.564
They?

01:04.939 --> 01:06.816
(indistinct chattering)

01:07.400 --> 01:09.027
Attention, please!

01:09.110 --> 01:09.944
People!

01:13.448 --> 01:17.952
I'll give you all that I have!
(whistles sharply)

01:18.036 --> 01:19.287
Hey! (whistles sharply)

01:20.705 --> 01:22.415
Let's have a little attention up here.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.375
Thank you.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.588
Now, I know that we're all upset
over the shooting

01:28.671 --> 01:30.632
that took place this morning
involving two members

01:30.715 --> 01:33.718
of our night watch,
officers Leyton and Gann.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.472
They were on special assignment
to Division's anti-crack task force.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.809
Many of you will recall Hal Leyton.

01:40.892 --> 01:44.562
He was a young man
that Neal Washington took under his wing

01:44.646 --> 01:46.147
and helped him get on the force.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.691
His death is tragic.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.070
-What happened to Gann?
-Yeah, Gann. Is he being charged?

01:52.153 --> 01:55.240
Officer Gann is in the custody
of the police surgeon

01:55.949 --> 01:58.409
for the standard 639 exam.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.495
MASON: Is he busted? Who pulls the case?

02:00.578 --> 02:02.956
All right, shooting case assignments.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.793
Officers Canby, Welsh,
Kuzlowski, and Moranse,

02:06.876 --> 02:11.464
you will substitute for the night watch
on crime site's crowd control,

02:11.548 --> 02:14.008
and detectives LaRue and Washington,

02:14.092 --> 02:17.846
you will pull primary investigation
and liaison with internal affairs.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.807
Captain Furillo has requested
that all officers

02:20.890 --> 02:23.601
maintain a blanket press silence.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.062
Now, that's with special emphasis
on this point

02:26.146 --> 02:30.608
since you may have noticed upstairs
a number of photographers among us.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.235
The Hill...

02:33.695 --> 02:38.408
and its guardians of law and order
has been chosen the subject...

02:39.409 --> 02:43.371
for the <i>Evening Tribune View</i>
magazine weekly feature

02:43.454 --> 02:45.206
"One Day in the Life Of."

02:45.290 --> 02:48.710
They have been given permission
to follow individuals around

02:48.793 --> 02:52.297
on assignment at the discretion
of the officers involved.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.841
Use your common sense.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.217
All right, item five,

02:57.260 --> 03:00.054
after 38 years
as the department accountant,

03:00.513 --> 03:03.057
Larry Winston is retiring.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.226
Who is he? I didn't even know his name.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.563
Item six,
because of the continuing slowdown

03:08.646 --> 03:11.316
of the medical examiners,
those of you unfortunate enough

03:11.399 --> 03:13.318
to encounter a corpse today

03:13.693 --> 03:18.239
may also encounter
harried paramedics filling in.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.826
Expect an extra half-hour
sitting each stiff.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.579
Item seven, Lieutenant Buntz

03:24.662 --> 03:27.624
to the ophthalmologist this A.M.,
8:00 to 9:30.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.292
Lieutenant Goldblume to cover.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.754
And item last, our neighborhood Visigoths

03:32.837 --> 03:35.673
continue mugging excessive
numbers of bums.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.594
Unfortunately, Mick Belker,
who was working an undercover lure,

03:39.677 --> 03:41.721
was recognized by some
of the potential victims,

03:41.804 --> 03:44.432
and as a result, we are stalemated.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.518
Um... dismissed.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.856
Uh, people! One... one more point.

03:53.650 --> 03:58.154
Common sense with the photographers today,
but also common sense with each other...

03:58.696 --> 04:02.533
with speaking out of turn
to each other about the shooting.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.869
We all want facts, not fictions.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.122
And in situations as these,

04:08.790 --> 04:14.921
I know from painful personal experience,
truth is a precious commodity.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.178
-So, about this new gang.
-What gang?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.180
-The Visigoths? Are they from the Heights?
-The what?

04:24.264 --> 04:27.183
I was out at the site.
They didn't even bust him.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.894
-Who, Gann?
-Chalk another one up for their side.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.479
What do you mean "their side"?

04:32.272 --> 04:35.066
Gann's a stone racist.
He hasn't been charged,

04:35.149 --> 04:37.235
and Lil' Abner here
doesn't really get it, does he?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.569
Don't you work the night shift, man?

04:38.653 --> 04:40.154
Why don't you go back to the night shift,
get some sleep?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.407
Hey, you're the one that's gotta wake up.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.659
This far up to these doors.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.745
Any pictures you want
except for civilians, suspects,

04:47.829 --> 04:50.123
anyone in for questioning, booking,

04:50.206 --> 04:52.083
relatives, and precinct employees, yeah?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.043
-Who's left?
-NORMAN: Hey, you can't

04:54.127 --> 04:55.336
take a picture like that.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.880
Come on, come on, huh?
What are you gonna do with that?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.924
A picture of me adjusting my acorns?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.343
I'm photographing a day in the life.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.886
It happens to be a part of life.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.931
I know, I know. You scratch, I scratch.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.183
I just don't want the women
and children of this city

05:09.267 --> 05:11.019
seeing me scratching my, uh...

05:11.602 --> 05:13.271
(clears throat) gentle area.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.605
Yeah, well, I won't give you the film.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.025
I stand on my First Amendment rights.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.944
Yeah? Which one is that,
freedom to be a Peeping Tom?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.322
I'm going to get my eyes examined.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.742
Watch your backs! Coming through!
Stolen property.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.827
Let me give you a hand here.
I'll give you a hand, all right?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.370
Hey, help us out, huh?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.621
-Come on, it's heavy.
-Lift, lift.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.623
-Look out!
-Oh! Oh!

05:32.707 --> 05:34.042
Oh!

05:36.336 --> 05:37.879
You crunched my film.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.798
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:40.882 --> 05:42.675
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:42.759 --> 05:46.471
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:46.554 --> 05:48.139
(sirens wailing)

05:53.895 --> 05:56.898
(theme music playing)

07:02.213 --> 07:04.799
So one of these kids
dealing crack on the street.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.968
And this is a corner
worth half a million a month.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.719
A month.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.555
Takes out the kid who owns that corner.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.391
We got the scratch on the case.
We saw a kid who matched the description,

07:13.474 --> 07:14.517
and we gave chase.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.603
-Sorry. He on tape?
-Glad you could make it.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.355
Officer Gann is filling us in

07:19.439 --> 07:21.149
on the details
of what happened this morning.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.942
The kid looked like Leyton.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.488
Both tall, Black, same build, a smoothy.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.824
They both had on down jackets.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.994
-They were both Black.
-You mentioned that.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.371
The streetlights were out.
It was dark, man.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.124
I was edging along the wall,
and Leyton came around the corner,

07:38.207 --> 07:40.877
and I clutched. I screwed up.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.421
(sighs)

07:45.298 --> 07:47.008
He came around the corner
like he was coming at me.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.509
-What do you mean by that?
-Like fast,

07:48.926 --> 07:50.928
like attacking,
like maybe he thought I was the perp.

07:51.012 --> 07:54.599
-You said the perp was Black.
-Or another perp, man! I don't know!

07:54.682 --> 07:55.933
You hear me? I screwed up!

07:56.017 --> 07:58.853
I knew Leyton ever since
I picked him up for boosting cars.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.938
I straightened him out,
got him on the force.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.273
-That right?
-That's right.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.774
Well, I'm sorry he's dead,
but the guy was a jerk.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.693
He never would have made
a mistake like you did.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.240
What happened to the suspect?
How did he get past Leyton?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.452
Was he in the alley
when the shooting happened, hiding?

08:14.952 --> 08:15.953
What about Gann's record?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.623
He said something about missing
his monthly practice on the range.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.957
Excuse me, Frank. I need it.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.047
Also anything at all you can find out
about Leyton and Gann's relationship.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.799
Update from SID,
update from the night guys.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.886
-Frank.
-Keep it low-key.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.680
Some people are still edgy
about what happened over in the Polk.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.557
We don't want this becoming
something it's not.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.560
Oh, Neal? You knew Leyton
better than anybody.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.021
-Is it a problem?
-I'll keep him in line.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.444
Eleven o'clock,
the brothers are meeting in roll call.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.072
Looks like the Black officer scout troops
are on the warpath.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.491
And it's important.
It's about the shooting.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.993
We don't want what happened
in the Polk to happen here.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.329
Funny, that's what Furillo just told us.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.164
I don't think we mean the same thing.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.920
-Excuse me. You Detective Washington?
-Right.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.755
Uh, I hear you're working
the "cop kills cop" case.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.091
Look, I don't have time to talk.
I got a lot on my plate.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.592
'Cause I've been out there since early.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.135
I wanna cover that in the course of today.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.012
J.D., what's the story
on the photographers?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.347
At our discretion.

09:17.014 --> 09:17.848
See ya around.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.185
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.645
Hey, who is that?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.564
Eye doctor put these drops in my eyes.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.315
I can't see my freaking nose.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.817
Blind Man Buntz?

09:27.900 --> 09:30.236
LaRue? Hey, read the Bible, pal.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.572
Samson was blind, too. Excuse me.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.240
(clears throat)

09:35.491 --> 09:38.869
Holy cow. Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.791
Man. Sorry, excu-- excuse me.
Excuse me, everybody.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.126
Need some help, Norman?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.379
Ah, Belker, listen, I was thinking
maybe I could help you.

09:48.462 --> 09:51.048
I heard about your problems
with the bum mugger.

09:51.132 --> 09:55.636
"Be thankful you can see."
"Spare change, mister?"

09:55.720 --> 09:58.639
-You want to go undercover?
-I don't want to hang around here all day.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.141
Norman, you can't see anything.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.685
Hey, you can protect me, all right?

10:03.060 --> 10:03.894
What do you think?

10:05.187 --> 10:06.564
What do you think of his state?

10:10.526 --> 10:11.902
You mean is Gann suicidal?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.488
It's hard to say. He's all over the place.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.574
One minute moaning about
how he screwed up,

10:16.657 --> 10:18.326
the next minute,
blaming Leyton for screwing up.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.912
-Yeah, he's pretty racked up.
-What about his family situation?

10:21.996 --> 10:24.874
-Nothing great. Divorce, no kids.
-(knocking)

10:24.957 --> 10:27.835
-Oh, sorry. Chief on line three.
-Thanks, Howard.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.673
I think Gann needs to talk to somebody,
professionally.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.720
Chief?

10:41.932 --> 10:42.850
I understand.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.227
I'm sure you would.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.856
Chief, I appreciate that,

10:48.939 --> 10:51.442
but I don't think that'll be necessary,
not at this time.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.487
Right. Thank you.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.532
He offered Division help
with the Leyton/Gann case.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.202
-Outside of IAD?
-I declined.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.621
He's probably scared because of the Polk.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.122
He didn't mention the Polk.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.627
(siren wails)

11:13.130 --> 11:14.173
(shivers)

11:14.465 --> 11:16.175
Okay, what do we have here?

11:17.843 --> 11:19.220
Oh, my God.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.306
Why would anybody want to skin a corpse?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.392
Took all the skin right off,
even the toes.

11:24.475 --> 11:28.020
A grown man, big old hump like that,
big dangly arms...

11:28.104 --> 11:30.648
-What did he die of?
-Uh, hard to tell.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.316
No bullet or stabs or anything.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.152
Oh, Lord, think about that.
Poor guy, big old head,

11:35.236 --> 11:38.739
humped over, comes into a bar,
sits down, orders a beer,

11:38.823 --> 11:41.242
talks to a little girl,
scares the daylights out of her.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.370
None of the typical signs
you'd expect in a situation like this.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.872
What do you mean, typical?
You've seen something like this before?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.083
And shirts! How would an individual

11:49.166 --> 11:51.001
that looks like this
find a shirt that fit him?

11:51.085 --> 11:53.796
From the subcutaneous bleeding,
which, of course,

11:53.879 --> 11:58.634
-after the unfortunate, um, skinning...
-(Bobby and Renko groan)

11:58.718 --> 12:00.928
...would no longer be subcutaneous,

12:01.011 --> 12:03.848
and the relatively even
drying of the flesh,

12:03.931 --> 12:07.017
I'd-I'd-I'd say the victim
was skinned alive.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.394
(shivers)

12:08.728 --> 12:11.188
Or he died a natural death
and then was skinned. I don't know.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.232
I'm just a paramedic.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.609
When they pay me to be ME,
then I'll let you know.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.487
What an undignified way to go.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.073
You remember my sofa
when I was having it reupholstered?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.117
All the stuffing was out.
It looked just like that.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.285
(shivers)

12:24.368 --> 12:27.580
Now, we all know
what happened in the Polk,

12:27.788 --> 12:29.457
-MAN 1: Yeah.
-MAN 2: That's right.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.209
And we know about the hidden racism
in the department,

12:32.835 --> 12:36.714
and we know about the efforts
to pretend that it doesn't exist

12:37.298 --> 12:38.215
or to cover it up.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.135
And we know about Gann.

12:41.218 --> 12:43.137
We know about the cracks
he made about Leyton,

12:43.220 --> 12:47.349
about his so-called
practical jokes, about--

12:48.601 --> 12:51.479
What I'm saying, his attitude.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.606
MAN: Yeah, we all know about attitude.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.984
Now, we are not out to get anybody.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.779
As some of our brother officers,

13:00.321 --> 13:02.490
White officers, will suggest.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.659
And we are not on a witch hunt,

13:06.076 --> 13:08.412
as some of our brother officers,

13:08.829 --> 13:11.123
White officers, will suggest.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.542
But early this morning,

13:14.168 --> 13:18.214
Harold Leyton walked into an alley,
a police officer with a future,

13:18.672 --> 13:21.383
and he never walked out of that alley,
'cause a White cop,

13:21.675 --> 13:23.844
a cop that everyone knows is a racist,

13:23.928 --> 13:28.349
a cop who tried to refuse duty
with a Black officer, shot him.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.355
And is that cop indicted?

13:34.438 --> 13:35.606
-No!
-WOMAN: No!

13:35.689 --> 13:36.524
No.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.026
Is he under arrest?

13:39.360 --> 13:40.945
ALL: No.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.112
No.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.659
Now, brothers, I am not saying
what went down,

13:48.160 --> 13:51.080
but I am saying we are gonna find out.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.624
-MAN 1: That's right!
-MAN 2: Yeah!

13:54.500 --> 13:57.086
Now, we know
that there will be no cover-up

13:57.753 --> 14:00.506
because there's a member
of the Black Officer's Coalition

14:00.589 --> 14:02.216
participating on the case.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.135
Detective Washington.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.556
MAN: It's about time.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.641
(murmuring and applause)

14:12.852 --> 14:14.478
No cover-up, and you can believe it.

14:18.232 --> 14:21.569
(indistinct chattering)

14:21.652 --> 14:23.904
-(sighs)
-Hey, you got business here?

14:24.697 --> 14:27.032
I told you, I'm covering
the crime scene dawn to dusk.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.701
Well, just stand behind the lines.

14:29.159 --> 14:29.994
Go on!

14:32.496 --> 14:33.581
So we go through it.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.626
-You be Leyton. I'll be Gann.
-Shouldn't it be the other way around?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.379
You just circle the building,
come down the other alley,

14:40.462 --> 14:42.339
around the corner, and down to this alley.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.507
Okay.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.851
(siren blaring in distance)

15:14.872 --> 15:16.790
-Bang!
-Leyton staggers...

15:18.876 --> 15:19.752
and he falls.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.172
-It all checks out.
-Look how close we were.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.216
Even in the dark, don't tell me that Gann
couldn't recognize his partner.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.135
Unless, like he says, he screwed up.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.762
At this distance? Uh-uh.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.180
I don't call that screwing up.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.016
If Leyton was facing Gann
the way you're facing me.

15:34.683 --> 15:38.812
And what would Leyton turn to his right
and stagger back up the alley, huh?

15:39.271 --> 15:42.232
-Why wouldn't he stagger toward the wall?
-Because he didn't.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.528
Unless Gann was standing
at the mouth of the alley

15:46.612 --> 15:47.738
as Leyton came toward him.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.825
Leyton's off guard.
Alley's empty. No perp, no danger.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.953
Leyton starts to put away his gun.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.829
Bang!

16:00.334 --> 16:01.835
Gann set Leyton up?

16:01.919 --> 16:04.922
Everyone knows Gann didn't like Blacks,
didn't like Leyton.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.508
Come on, man, don't go native on me, okay?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.343
Pow!

16:09.426 --> 16:12.221
-Another thing--
-Oh, here we go again.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.932
Tell us more about the skinned person,
would you, Renko?

16:15.015 --> 16:18.477
The movies, can you imagine the poor guy
trying to fit into a seat?

16:18.852 --> 16:21.981
His hump would push him so far forward
that he wouldn't have no leg room.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.691
You ever tried to sit
through a whole big movie

16:23.774 --> 16:25.985
with your legs all squished up
against the seat in front of you?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.152
-Think about it.
-Please!

16:28.195 --> 16:30.114
-Hey, Luce.
-Hi, Pats.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.074
Hi, how are ya?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.785
-Not bad. Can we go to dinner some night?
-Sure.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.913
-Next week?
-Yeah, well, call me.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.249
My life's been like
a demolition derby lately.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.292
All right, I will. Take it easy.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.378
DISPATCHER (on radio):
<i>Disturbance outside grocery store</i>

16:44.461 --> 16:45.921
<i>corner of Greene and Waymouth.</i>

16:46.005 --> 16:47.673
Let's see what the bad guys
are doing, huh?

16:47.756 --> 16:51.010
-You know those Chinese back scratchers?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.054
Hey, Phillips.
So, how'd the BOC meeting go?

16:54.138 --> 16:54.972
Pretty good turnout.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.141
-Mason thinks it's a cover-up.
-No arrest?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.310
Only good thing is
Washington's on the case.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.232
(siren wailing, tires screeching)

17:07.276 --> 17:08.777
Hey, drop the gun now!

17:09.611 --> 17:13.323
LUCY: Break it up, everybody, right now!
The war is over, all right?

17:13.532 --> 17:14.950
Take it easy and tell me
what happened, huh?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.326
Go back to Berlin!

17:16.410 --> 17:18.328
For years we're going to this store.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.748
A nice grocery, we thought.
So what happened?

17:20.831 --> 17:23.125
Today we go in the nice grocery

17:23.208 --> 17:25.419
and the grocer's wearing a Nazi armband!

17:25.502 --> 17:30.215
Two years I spend in Treblinka
so now I can buy corn flakes from a Nazi?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.843
Okay, you want to just goose-step
inside for a moment?

17:35.220 --> 17:37.389
Do you have a permit for this antique?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.808
You know how many times
I've been robbed in the last month?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.101
Four times.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.853
The cops say, "Put gates on the windows."

17:42.936 --> 17:44.188
Well, the gates don't help.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.440
The cops say,
"Put PBA stickers on the door."

17:46.523 --> 17:49.526
The PBA stickers don't help.
Look at this. Look at that. See that?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.404
Last Thursday,
punks hit me right in the face

17:52.488 --> 17:55.949
with a can of green beans,
so I decided to try to scare 'em.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.160
Since I've been wearing this,
I ain't been robbed once.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.120
Do you have a permit for this gun?

18:02.289 --> 18:04.374
-No.
-Where'd you get all this stuff?

18:04.458 --> 18:08.087
-What stuff?
-The picture of Hitler, the flags.

18:08.712 --> 18:09.546
You really a Nazi?

18:09.630 --> 18:12.174
I ain't saying nothing.
This is a free country.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.802
Well, Fritz, we're gonna have to
take you in for this gun.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.806
In your testimony before the Sullivan
Anti-Corruption Subcommittee,

18:19.306 --> 18:21.809
you were asked about
some questionable associates.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.769
My brother-in-law and his jerky son.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.272
They were involved in
mob-related activities.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.192
-What's this have to do with Leyton?
-That's what I'm asking.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.528
What was your relationship
with your brother-in-law?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.821
My ex-brother-in-law.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.323
Leyton knew you'd been questioned
by the Sullivan Commission.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.992
The Commission wasn't after me.

18:39.701 --> 18:40.744
I wasn't suggesting it was.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.996
Check my jacket.
Except for some Mickey Mouse stuff

18:43.080 --> 18:45.541
like missing target practice,
I'm Mother Teresa.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.376
Did the business
with the Sullivan Commission

18:47.459 --> 18:49.002
cause any trouble between you and Leyton?

18:49.586 --> 18:51.004
Nobody said we were in love
with each other.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.673
Is that why you kept
requesting reassignment?

18:52.756 --> 18:56.051
He didn't like my relatives.
I didn't like his.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.263
Are we to take that as a racist remark?

18:59.346 --> 19:01.014
(door opens)

19:01.515 --> 19:03.934
(clears throat) Chief wants to see you.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.603
Thanks, Howard.
Henry, would you take over here a bit?

19:11.733 --> 19:12.568
Chief.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.822
I want you to call off
the Gann/Leyton investigation.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.740
-We're gonna carry it on downtown.
-Why?

19:19.533 --> 19:20.450
I can't tell you that.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.453
Oh, for God's sake, Frank.
One cop kills another cop,

19:23.537 --> 19:26.290
that's a big story, and you've got
photographers crawling all over the place.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.458
There are gonna be leaks all day!
I want it out of here.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.294
Gann/Leyton is a Hill case.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.714
You take it away, you cast suspicion
on the ability and integrity of my people.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.426
I'm not casting suspicion.
I'm relieving you of the hot potato.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.305
Only one IAD shipman is on it.
Everything is strictly need-to-know.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.349
Unless there's a compelling argument,
there's no reason to transfer this case.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.976
Captain, be reasonable.

19:48.645 --> 19:49.688
(sighs)

19:49.771 --> 19:51.732
We're on the verge
of closing in on some cops

19:51.815 --> 19:53.317
who were involved in big drug buys.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.902
What does that have to do
with Gann and Leyton?

19:54.985 --> 19:58.572
Investigation of Gann
leads to information that queers the bust.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.575
Gann's dirty.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.411
Leyton knew it, and Gann killed Leyton.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.663
-Both.
-Both?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.582
Both were dirty.
I don't know who said what to who,

20:08.665 --> 20:10.584
who cheated who, but they were both dirty.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.252
How many others? How deep does this go?

20:12.336 --> 20:14.755
For God's sake, Captain,
do I have to spell it out to you?

20:14.838 --> 20:18.550
That's exactly what you have to do, yes,
when you ask me to pull my men off!

20:18.884 --> 20:21.178
The Black Officers Coalition
had a meeting on this case.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.013
I'm sitting
on an explosive situation here!

20:25.557 --> 20:28.936
The whole ring's in the anti-crack force.
I've set up a special team to investigate.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.273
You haven't seen this. This doesn't exist.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.609
Do you have proof,
or is this some vague surmise

20:35.692 --> 20:37.110
one of your special teams is working on?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.695
Proof, statements, witnesses.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.199
So, one dirty cop kills another dirty cop
because of some dirty piece of business.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.116
Correct.

20:44.701 --> 20:49.039
You can have 24 hours on the condition
that when the bust goes down,

20:49.122 --> 20:50.123
my men participate.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.541
-How many? Who?
-LaRue and Washington.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.877
-You got it.
-You and Patsy still on

20:53.961 --> 20:55.504
for 7:30 Saturday dinner?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.297
Let's put a hold on that, huh, Frank?

20:57.381 --> 20:58.632
(clears throat)
Patsy and I are having trouble.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.884
-Serious?
-It's serious.

21:04.137 --> 21:04.972
Howard?

21:06.598 --> 21:08.225
Could you raise LaRue and Washington
for me, please?

21:08.308 --> 21:09.142
Sure.

21:10.978 --> 21:11.853
MAN: Here you go, buddy.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.817
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.736
-(kicks box)
-Who's there?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.321
Know what I was just thinking?

21:22.364 --> 21:25.367
Every year, kids let go of
how many balloons would you think?

21:25.450 --> 21:27.869
Ten thousand, 100,000 balloons?

21:28.954 --> 21:32.374
These balloons do not go up into space.
They don't vanish, you know.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.419
The pop or they lose their air.
They fall back to Earth.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.171
But we never see them.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.550
Where do all these balloons land?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.220
-What time is it?
-It's lunchtime.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.931
Good, I'm starved. Let's go for a slice.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.558
(grunts)

21:52.144 --> 21:53.061
Ooh, it's freezing.

21:53.770 --> 21:55.856
MAN: Of course I'm not a Nazi,

21:56.315 --> 21:58.400
but after I put up all that Nazi stuff,

21:58.483 --> 22:00.652
I haven't been robbed once, not once.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.072
But you've got to understand that
there are many people in your community

22:04.156 --> 22:06.950
that find anything
having to do with Nazis offensive.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.910
Yeah, and I feel very bad about that.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.288
You think I like going around
saying I'm a Nazi?

22:11.371 --> 22:12.873
I gotta survive here!

22:13.498 --> 22:16.626
My brother had that store for years.
Last May, he had a heart attack.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.462
You want to know
why he had a heart attack?

22:18.712 --> 22:21.423
From being robbed, mugged, persecuted!

22:22.132 --> 22:24.301
So you think you're gonna
scare people off by being a Nazi?

22:24.384 --> 22:26.303
You're gonna have your windows
broken every single night.

22:26.386 --> 22:28.221
The charge against you is serious.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.223
You had an unlicensed handgun.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.977
I took that gun
off a German soldier in 1944!

22:34.061 --> 22:37.439
Mr. Leonard,
if you remove the Nazi material,

22:38.231 --> 22:40.734
I think we'll be able to do something
about the gun charge.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.903
I'm sure my client
would consider taking down

22:42.986 --> 22:46.073
the objectionable items
of Nazi memorabilia,

22:46.865 --> 22:49.201
just as I am sure
that the department will understand

22:49.284 --> 22:52.037
that the gun in question
is not a firearm for use

22:52.120 --> 22:52.996
but a collector's item.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.666
Hey, Hitler, is what she's saying right?
Take down all the Nazi stuff?

22:56.750 --> 23:00.170
-What about my store?
-We'll put you down for added pass-bys.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.755
That's very encouraging.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.759
My client is fully ready to comply,
aren't you, Mr. Leonard?

23:08.845 --> 23:11.932
Yeah. I'll take down the Nazi stuff.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.021
I'm temporarily taking you off

23:18.105 --> 23:19.606
-the Gann/Leyton case.
-What?

23:19.689 --> 23:21.858
Just 24 hours, maybe less.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.944
-Why?
-I can't tell you.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.822
You pull us off the case,
you know what's gonna happen, Captain?

23:27.239 --> 23:28.865
People are gonna think
something's being covered up.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.450
I give you my word there's no cover-up.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.953
And I gave my word
to the Black Officers Coalition

23:33.036 --> 23:33.870
that I'd see this through.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.123
I'm sorry, that's it.
Thank you, gentlemen.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.959
-No way.
-Hey, man, come on.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.461
Captain, you can't pull us off the case.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.005
I told you, 24 hours.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.093
-It's from the chief's desk.
-Neal, come on.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.428
The chief, huh?

23:50.637 --> 23:51.471
(door opens)

23:54.391 --> 23:56.017
Uh, look, Detective, I know you're busy,

23:56.101 --> 23:57.477
but if I could just ask you
this one favor?

23:57.561 --> 23:59.813
On these photos,
in order for them to use them,

23:59.896 --> 24:02.107
they've gotta have releases
of the people in them.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.733
-Where do I sign?
-No, not you.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.360
I-I mean, we can get you later.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.320
No, I got a photo
of the witness this morning.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.573
-What witness?
-The witness.

24:10.365 --> 24:11.908
The witness you guys
picked up at the crime scene.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.326
Where are they keeping him?
I just need his name.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.830
-What are you talking about?
-Hey, Neal, we're off the case.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.083
You saw some cops
pick a witness up this morning?

24:20.625 --> 24:24.921
Uh, well, I was out early
taking some pictures of, you know,

24:25.005 --> 24:27.090
the street at dawn, stuff like that,
for the photo essay.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.134
Yeah? Yeah?

24:29.217 --> 24:30.969
Uh, so I heard the gunshot.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.763
I figured it's some pusher
wasting some other pusher.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.100
I head over to the sound,
figure I might get some real hot shots,

24:37.517 --> 24:40.228
and by the time I arrived,
there's this cop heading up the alley

24:40.312 --> 24:43.440
and this other cop hustling this kid,
this witness, into a car.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.109
-How do you know the guy was a witness?
-I don't know.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.445
I mean, I heard someone say he was,
that's all.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.655
The shooter cop was sitting on the ground.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.867
-Did he see the witness?
-I don't think so, no.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.036
What cop took the witness?

24:56.119 --> 25:00.499
Well, a cop. He was a cop, I don't know.
A cop, plainclothes.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.877
Hey, look, I want to see that picture.
Go get it developed.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.756
Yeah, all right.
Uh, one hour or regular service?

25:07.839 --> 25:08.715
One hour.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.844
-You'll help me get my releases?
-Definitely.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.556
You gotta ease up, man.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.684
A witness tagged by someone
downtown this morning

25:19.768 --> 25:21.061
before the precinct's on the case.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.522
I don't know, man,
but if Furillo says we're off,

25:23.605 --> 25:25.357
he's gotta have some explanation.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.401
Yeah? Try this,
someone's covering for Gann.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.278
Right. Who, Furillo?

25:31.363 --> 25:33.657
-You gotta be out of your mind.
-Hey, hey, look, man.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.493
What's the one thing
the department don't want, huh?

25:36.576 --> 25:39.621
A race war. White cop kills Black cop.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.498
The department's looking
at a bad scene, man.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.584
-Everybody gets told to back off.
-Which is what we're gonna do.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.836
Well, I gave my word to Mason
that I wouldn't back off.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.506
Not me, man.
You do this, you're on your own.

25:49.589 --> 25:52.592
Look, man, I'm telling you,
I hope this ain't no cover-up,

25:52.676 --> 25:54.928
'cause if it is, I'm done as a cop.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.144
-Here. Turn around. Sit down here.
-Okay.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.357
-What's the matter? You ain't hungry?
-I bring my own lunch.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.068
You figure that costs, what,

26:10.610 --> 26:13.363
buck and a quarter for the sandwich,
50 cents for the soda--

26:13.446 --> 26:16.324
that's $1.75 it costs you for lunch.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.410
And I make my own sandwiches.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.995
I want you to try this. Here.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.416
That costs me 25 cents a day.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.837
I save $1.50.
That's $7.50 a week, $30 a month,

26:28.920 --> 26:31.464
$360 a year I save on lunch.

26:31.548 --> 26:34.050
And I'll tell you something else,
in a family situation,

26:34.134 --> 26:35.760
you always gotta think about those things.

26:35.844 --> 26:39.347
And to maximize savings,
you gotta be a little creative.

26:43.852 --> 26:44.853
You like that stuff?

26:45.895 --> 26:48.398
-What is it?
-This is a spread that I make.

26:48.690 --> 26:52.611
Chopped cabbage, sardine paste,
mashed lung boiled,

26:52.694 --> 26:54.404
and a schmear of chicken fat.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.488
Chicken fat?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.825
-What's the matter? You got a bone?
-(horn honks)

27:01.828 --> 27:03.913
-What?
-It's Washington.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.002
Hey, fellas, show you something.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.671
He's still blind.
What do you want to know?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.173
Polyester's a detective.

27:13.256 --> 27:15.258
Quinlan on night shift
said you used to work with him, Norm.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.551
I don't know him. Describe him.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.846
Uh, he's 5'10", overweight,

27:19.929 --> 27:21.765
red cheeks, big nose,

27:21.848 --> 27:23.892
looks like he's got a mole
on his forehead.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.978
Oh, that's Maxie O'Connell.
He used to be over at the Heights.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.690
And that's not a mole.
It's more like a big, ugly red dot.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.192
Yeah, that could be red.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.944
Yeah. Mole O'Connell. He's Division now.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.614
-Hey, thanks, fellas. It's what I needed.
-Yeah.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.451
Earth to Robert.
Do we have radio contact here?

27:43.036 --> 27:44.788
I just wish the captain
would make a statement.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.583
-About what?
-About Gann and Leyton.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.336
-Everybody's talking about a cover-up.
-Not to me.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.963
(laughs) I guess not.

27:54.297 --> 27:57.384
DISPATCH (on radio):
<i>Possible homicide, Sycamore and 139.</i>

27:58.468 --> 28:00.303
Two-two-oh-two in response.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.598
Uh, is that a possible
'cause the individual's not deceased yet,

28:03.682 --> 28:06.184
or 'cause we don't know
the cause of death?

28:06.267 --> 28:07.143
<i>Stiff is deceased.</i>

28:07.227 --> 28:09.479
(siren wailing)

28:17.904 --> 28:19.698
Okay, get back, step back.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.912
-This one's skinned, too.
-I noticed.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.790
-That's two skinned corpses today.
-I noticed that, too.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.667
-Within a dozen blocks--
-Right!

28:32.711 --> 28:36.506
You know, this one looks
more like a sumo wrestler or something.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.091
At least the guy's not a hunchback.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.595
In the opinion of my superiors,
that "hunchback" was a gorilla.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.224
-Gorilla?
-And if you ask me...

28:46.933 --> 28:48.393
This looks like a grizzly bear.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.022
-Thanks for your trouble.
-Yeah, all right, Mr. Charlton. Thank you.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.983
Yo! Any news?

28:55.608 --> 28:57.652
Don't you have a shift coming up, Mason?

28:57.736 --> 29:00.029
-First, we're off the case.
-What?

29:00.113 --> 29:02.866
Second, Division's been working the street
from the jump, man.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.743
Let's get the brothers downstairs.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.786
I want Furillo down there, too.

29:08.037 --> 29:09.706
Hey, Wash, what's the word?

29:10.373 --> 29:13.209
Detective O'Connell of Division
has got a witness stash.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.420
Downstairs, soon as we get the peep.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.547
You know, this is a hell of a thing.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.883
Incident like this,
people get all screwed up.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.217
Mason's doing it.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.553
Yeah, well, if I was Mason,
I'd be wondering, too.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.849
Captain, there's gonna be
a B.O.C. meeting.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.100
We want you there.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.562
Before you go, take a look
at Detective Mole O'Connell

29:32.645 --> 29:35.857
out of Division,
5:00 A.M. at the crime site.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.822
I told you, I can't say anything.
I'm under orders.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.491
But I can assure you
there's been no cover-up.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.825
Why were we taken off the case?

29:45.909 --> 29:47.535
Captain, we heard Division
grabbed the thing

29:47.619 --> 29:49.078
before we ever got a chance to work it.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.331
Or hiding stuff
while we were trying to work.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.916
Well, that part's inexcusable,

29:52.999 --> 29:54.584
and there will be an accounting,
but there's a reason.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.169
Yeah, there's a reason all right.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.087
Yeah, and we know what that reason is.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.632
You got a White cop
that killed a Black cop.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.591
(all agreeing)

30:01.674 --> 30:02.759
You talking about racism?

30:03.843 --> 30:05.929
White and Black, Captain. White and Black.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.848
No, two officers. One dead, one alive,

30:08.932 --> 30:11.184
and tragic circumstances,
which are being investigated.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.770
-Who's investigating?
-You know who's investigating,

30:14.062 --> 30:15.939
and we all know what happened at the Polk.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.525
Any attempt to make this case
bigger than it is

30:18.608 --> 30:21.611
could light a fire in this community
that would be very hard to put out,

30:21.694 --> 30:23.196
and that wouldn't do you
or anybody any good.

30:23.279 --> 30:26.366
Everyone knew Gann had it in for Leyton.
You can't protect Gann forever.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.201
You accusing me of obstructing justice?

30:28.284 --> 30:31.538
Just giving justice a little too much room
to operate in, Captain.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.374
Let me remind you
this is not a debating society.

30:34.457 --> 30:37.252
If anybody has a complaint
or a specific charge to make,

30:37.335 --> 30:39.128
let him file it with proper authorities.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.297
Neal, J.D., in my office.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.383
(crowd murmuring)

30:52.725 --> 30:54.561
This isn't for Mason,
it's not for the Coalition.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.104
-It's just for you.
-Yeah?

30:56.187 --> 30:58.565
But you don't hear it
unless I know it goes no further,

30:58.648 --> 31:01.067
and if you don't hear it,
I'm taking you off the case permanently.

31:01.818 --> 31:02.861
Come on, man.

31:03.444 --> 31:05.113
Hey, look, I don't want to
get in a position, Captain,

31:05.196 --> 31:06.823
I mean, where I'm betraying anybody.

31:06.906 --> 31:09.158
I'm not betraying you,
so you won't be betraying anybody else.

31:11.953 --> 31:12.787
Okay.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.582
Gann and Leyton
were tied in with some cops

31:15.665 --> 31:19.335
who were using the anti-crack team
to make drug deals, major deals.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.504
Apparently Leyton wanted out.
Gann killed him.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.840
Division has it all.
Statements, everything.

31:23.923 --> 31:24.841
Drug deal?

31:27.468 --> 31:29.429
Then Mason is wrong.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.638
Hey, brother, I told you,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.765
things ain't always
what they appear to be.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.685
And that's worth taking us
off the case for?

31:35.768 --> 31:37.353
A deal's going down this afternoon.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.315
The chief isn't sure,
but he thinks it's a six-figure payoff.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.151
He's afraid if word leaks out
that we know about Gann,

31:43.234 --> 31:44.777
the others will figure
we know about everything else

31:44.861 --> 31:45.945
and they'll just go into hiding.

31:46.029 --> 31:48.656
So when the Division Task Force hits,
I want you with them.

31:48.865 --> 31:49.908
(knocking)

31:49.991 --> 31:51.409
Excuse me, Frank.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.411
Uh, Detective Mayo called.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.205
Uh, tell her I'll call back, Howard.

31:56.289 --> 31:59.250
(stutters) Some kind of an apology
about Saturday night dinner.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.419
-She sounded rather upset.
-Later, Howard.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.551
Look, Captain, about the meeting--

32:08.843 --> 32:12.472
I think it gave everybody a chance
to get their fears out.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.808
-Right.
-Come on.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.480
Another gorilla.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.526
But I think we got a lead here.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.498
Larry Busch,
purveyor of fine meats and meat products.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.832
Larry, is that your gorilla?

32:40.166 --> 32:41.250
-Who says so?
-I do.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.169
There's a trail of dead animals
leading to your place here.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.297
Hey, Mr. Busch,
we're missing six sides of specialty.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.091
The lock of the truck busted again.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.760
Every time we hit a pothole,
we lose another carcass.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.262
-So what if it's mine?
-You're in serious trouble.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.515
-I am? For what?
-False purvey to the public.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.475
What are you guys talking about, huh?

32:57.558 --> 32:59.435
Don't you read the papers
about people's changing tastes?

32:59.519 --> 33:02.605
These days, trying to make it
in beef, lamb, pork, forget it.

33:02.855 --> 33:06.192
You never heard of venison,
boar, quail, beefalo, huh?

33:06.484 --> 33:08.903
Gorilla, too.
I give 'em what they want. They love it.

33:09.570 --> 33:11.155
Meat nouvelle, huh?

33:11.531 --> 33:13.199
Come back when you got a legitimate beef.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.118
What are you gonna charge him
with, Renko, littering?

33:15.201 --> 33:16.536
Let's get out of here.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.788
You're the one that don't have
a legitimate beef.

33:26.754 --> 33:27.714
I've been there, buddy.

33:28.131 --> 33:31.300
I've been right there
where you're sitting, buddy.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.513
This very street, this very corner.

33:36.055 --> 33:39.767
I sat right where you are.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.438
I was as down and out as you.

33:43.938 --> 33:47.150
I figured life was all over for me.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.236
But, uh, look at me now.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.613
Just look at me now!

33:53.322 --> 33:56.034
I was drunk as bad as you.

33:56.701 --> 34:01.289
Then, vacuum cleaner bags. (chuckles)

34:01.372 --> 34:04.542
My company makes vacuum cleaner bags.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.504
-Grosses a quarter mil a year.
-Leave me alone.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.050
That's what I said
when everybody tried to help me,

34:12.133 --> 34:15.428
but you can get out
of the gutter like I did.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.847
It can be done. Come on.

34:19.599 --> 34:23.603
You can do it.
You got a shot left. Come on.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.981
That's it. Get up on your haunches.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.610
Look, buddy, you're gonna have
your spot back in a minute,

34:30.693 --> 34:32.028
and the way you're drinkin',
you're gonna need it.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.154
Now, leave me alone.

34:33.613 --> 34:37.033
Come on, pal.
(stammers) You don't have to beg.

34:37.116 --> 34:40.620
You can do it on your own. You can do it!

34:40.703 --> 34:43.122
Oh, no! No!

34:43.873 --> 34:44.874
Don't mug him!

34:44.957 --> 34:49.712
-Hey! Hey!
-Police officer! (grunts)

34:50.463 --> 34:53.466
-(groaning) That was me!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.385
-Hey, man, you're just doing your job.
-Come on.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.972
I knew Gann
from a weekend weapons seminar.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.183
Not too great an individual.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.560
Leyton, I never met.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.604
Nice kid.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.066
A little flash. A little.

35:11.067 --> 35:15.238
If he were a baseball player,
you'd call him a foot-long dog.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.031
DISPATCH (on radio):
<i>Disturbance outside grocery store,</i>

35:17.115 --> 35:18.533
<i>corner of Greene and Waymouth.</i>

35:19.951 --> 35:21.994
Oh, man.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.330
<i>Uber alles</i> or what?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.916
(siren wailing)

35:33.673 --> 35:35.758
He robbed me! They all robbed me!

35:35.842 --> 35:37.969
-You see which way he went?
-I was inside, damn it!

35:38.052 --> 35:40.805
-You want me to get shot, too?
-Can't find 'em.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.057
Come on,
let's take a drive around. Get in.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.308
Lock it up.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.228
I was doin' fine before.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.815
Come on, we'll show you some books
of pictures. You never know.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.317
I know. I'll look at pictures for an hour,

35:53.401 --> 35:55.278
then you'll tell me
you'll give me more pass-bys.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.990
The ASPCA, so they said
that you would know.

35:59.073 --> 35:59.907
The zoo.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.200
What department?

36:01.284 --> 36:04.203
Um, the gorilla house?

36:04.287 --> 36:06.664
MICK:
I asked you what your name was, hair bag!

36:06.747 --> 36:09.625
Hey, these eye drops
are starting to wear off.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.586
(chuckles) I can see stuff.

36:13.838 --> 36:17.175
Yes, sir. They are? How long?

36:18.426 --> 36:22.054
Oh. Yes, sir.
We'll be back to you soon. Thank you.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.640
Guess what's missing
from the morgue at the zoo.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.351
-They got a morgue at the zoo?
-Two gorilla carcasses, a bear,

36:27.435 --> 36:29.520
and three other wildlife deceased.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.189
-Notting Hill Meat.
-That's right.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.899
Notting Hill Meats!

36:34.775 --> 36:35.610
(chuckles)

36:38.779 --> 36:39.614
Hey, uh...

36:41.073 --> 36:43.659
does this say "Notting Hill Meats?"

36:43.743 --> 36:44.744
Yeah. Why?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.627
Excuse me, gentlemen.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.171
Somebody care for a sandwich here?

36:55.254 --> 36:57.423
-Ah, Larry.
-Excuse me.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.383
-Cold cuts?
-Oh, here.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.927
Larrabee, have a sandwich.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.179
Sandwich, Mason?

37:03.763 --> 37:06.766
Why don't you bring Gann a sandwich
so he can take it downtown?

37:06.849 --> 37:09.769
Come, come, man.
Give justice time to work.

37:10.394 --> 37:13.731
Meanwhile, Larry Winston here
has had 38 years in accounting.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.107
Oh, 38 years?

37:15.441 --> 37:16.859
Well, Leyton didn't even make three.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.278
You know what I think about your 38 years?

37:22.531 --> 37:23.407
Mason!

37:25.451 --> 37:26.911
You're on report.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.288
Howard, this is not the time for a party.

37:29.789 --> 37:30.623
Pack it up.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.540
(camera clicks)

37:42.134 --> 37:45.513
(all shouting)

37:47.223 --> 37:49.392
-Put your hands up!
-Where's the stuff? Where's the stuff?

37:50.726 --> 37:52.228
-All I got's change.
-MAN: Dope on Hamelin.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.312
Nothing over here.

37:53.396 --> 37:57.149
Three-hundred, four... 500 bucks?
This gonna be it, guys?

37:57.233 --> 37:59.068
You morons,
I was setting this guy up for bribery.

37:59.151 --> 37:59.986
Yeah, yeah.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.654
Teachers get bigger payoffs than this

38:01.737 --> 38:03.781
in the third-grade classroom
on the corner.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.449
I told you, this is Mickey Mouse, man.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.285
-Aw, shut up.
-Keep lookin', okay?

38:11.330 --> 38:14.417
Two grunt-level cops in a six-bit scam.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.253
You think maybe this is just
the tip of the iceberg, Neal?

38:17.336 --> 38:19.839
Right. It means the iceberg
is about the size of my toaster.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.091
-Hey, brother, you got a minute?
-Mason, what's your problem?

38:22.174 --> 38:25.303
What's my problem?
My problem's a brother who was on the case

38:25.386 --> 38:27.805
promised there'd be no cover-up,
promised to deal straight.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.015
Hey, look, I ain't the chief, all right.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.350
No. You're just a cop who rolled over.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.769
Hey, man-- Hey, you don't know anything!

38:33.853 --> 38:35.521
Some stuff I don't need to know!

38:35.604 --> 38:37.940
You don't know, man! You don't know!
I don't even know!

38:38.024 --> 38:40.609
-And that's good enough for you!
-Come on. Come on!

38:45.614 --> 38:47.783
I put Mason on report
for starting a scuffle.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.285
By logic, I should put you on, too.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.454
Well, that's just great then, Captain.
Just go right ahead.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.457
How'd the bust go?

38:54.915 --> 38:56.876
Wasn't any six-figure deal.
Wasn't even a buy.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.544
It was a just a cheap, jack,
low-level payoff.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.340
Two detectives, Rogers and Hamelin.
Division's got them.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.258
You put me out there, Captain,

39:04.342 --> 39:06.135
after I told you I gave my word
to the brothers.

39:06.218 --> 39:08.095
You took me off the case.
I went along with that.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.765
You played me this song and dance
about the big bust getting queered.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.850
-I went along with that.
-Let me find out.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.226
It's too late
for finding out now, Captain.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.311
It's too late for me with a lot of people!

39:15.394 --> 39:16.479
Let me find out.

39:19.190 --> 39:22.485
I'm going over to Division, Howard.
Call the chief. Tell him I'm on the way.

39:23.027 --> 39:26.155
The animals die of natural causes.
They keep the bodies frozen.

39:26.530 --> 39:29.784
-Once a month, we pick them up.
-Or once a month you steal them.

39:30.284 --> 39:35.206
-Hey, you the owner of Notting Hill Meats?
-Yes, sir. Larry Busch.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.250
Sir, could you help me
out of this misunderstanding here?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.669
-I tried one of your meat products.
-You like it?

39:41.170 --> 39:42.213
(belches)

39:46.675 --> 39:48.552
You had a witness to the shooting all day.

39:49.136 --> 39:51.263
You were on the case six hours
before you informed me,

39:51.680 --> 39:55.142
at which point you pull us off
with assurances of a major arrest,

39:55.226 --> 39:57.103
which I reluctantly go along with,

39:57.645 --> 40:01.649
pull my men away,
make them promises based on your promises,

40:01.732 --> 40:02.608
and it's all crap.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.528
I can't help it if the haul
was smaller than expected.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.654
What about the witness?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.699
The one O'Connell snatched
at-at 5:00 this morning?

40:10.783 --> 40:12.618
Frank, I told you
about the need for secrecy.

40:12.701 --> 40:13.786
You lied to me!

40:13.869 --> 40:15.788
Now, that's a little harsh,
don't you think, Captain?

40:16.872 --> 40:19.291
-Detective Mayo's here to see you.
-Tell her to wait five minutes.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.211
-Excuse me. It doesn't wait.
-Patsy--

40:22.294 --> 40:24.130
-Detective. Excuse me.
-No. Stay.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.966
Patsy, whatever our personal relations,

40:27.049 --> 40:28.968
I've got a captain in my office
and I won't tolerate--

40:29.051 --> 40:32.054
Won't tolerate what? Won't tolerate this?

40:32.513 --> 40:34.807
-You know what he did?
-Patsy, come on.

40:34.890 --> 40:37.143
I told him a month ago it was finished.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.436
He had me tailed.

40:38.519 --> 40:43.232
He found out who I was going out with,
and now-- and now you set up Ricky.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.692
He set up my boyfriend.

40:44.775 --> 40:47.903
-He set up an innocent cop, Captain!
-I didn't set anyone up.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.406
To hurt me,
you ruined Ricky Rogers' career!

40:50.489 --> 40:52.825
-Patsy, that is preposterous.
-Go to hell!

40:56.579 --> 40:58.205
Rogers was guilty as sin.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.290
I don't know which is worse,

40:59.373 --> 41:02.293
a cover-up or a penny-ante
personal vendetta.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.506
Frank, this whole thing
has been hell on me.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.424
Hell on you?

41:08.757 --> 41:11.260
I have one of my best cops,
one of the best cops in the city,

41:11.343 --> 41:14.013
about to do exactly what Patsy did
because he thinks I lied to him.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.266
Neal Washington would give his life
for this department,

41:17.349 --> 41:19.935
and you cost him face
in front of every Black cop on the Hill.

41:24.648 --> 41:27.109
-I'm sorry.
-"Sorry" doesn't cut it, Chief.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.402
If it costs me my own badge,

41:28.486 --> 41:31.113
you're going to apologize to him
and my Black officers.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.492
-What?
-I have a scandal here!

41:34.909 --> 41:38.954
I have 20 cops who think of you, me,
and everybody as racist crooks!

41:39.038 --> 41:41.373
-There was never a hint of racism!
-Tell them that.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.170
I'll talk to your BOC
immediately after shift.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.087
Thank you.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.759
If you can think of any way
to keep Patsy from blabbing,

41:52.718 --> 41:54.053
I could use a favor back.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.557
Your apology isn't a favor.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.982
Hey, we just thought we'd swing by
to see how you were doing.

42:07.066 --> 42:07.942
No matter what happened today,

42:08.025 --> 42:09.985
I think it was a good idea
to take down all that...

42:11.946 --> 42:13.072
Nazi stuff.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.408
Yeah, you were right about the Nazis.
Mafia's better.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.496
Just to be clear.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.332
Officer Gann has been arrested,

42:24.124 --> 42:27.169
charged with murder one
in the death of his partner, Hal Leyton.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.881
Gann has also been charged,
along with officers Rogers and Hamelin

42:30.965 --> 42:33.842
of the anti-crack task force,
with bribery and public corruption.

42:33.926 --> 42:37.346
Until this matter is resolved,
all three officers are on suspension.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.894
We delayed in arresting Officer Gann...

42:45.354 --> 42:48.774
on the murder charge until we could bring
charges in the bribery case.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.985
We did this for reasons
that I thought were necessary

42:51.068 --> 42:52.528
and that turned out to be insufficient.

42:53.112 --> 42:56.115
The extent of the bribery
was neither as widespread

42:56.198 --> 42:58.617
nor as pervasive
as surveillance suggested.

42:59.201 --> 43:01.036
Sometimes you have to do something extra.

43:02.371 --> 43:04.999
I asked your captain for silence,
and he obliged me.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.918
In executing my wishes,

43:08.002 --> 43:10.504
he commanded detectives
Washington and LaRue

43:10.588 --> 43:12.381
temporarily off the Gann case,

43:12.464 --> 43:15.050
which I understand,
if left to his own excellent devices,

43:15.134 --> 43:17.970
Detective Washington might have solved
in a matter of hours.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.388
As for racism...

43:21.932 --> 43:24.101
I will not tolerate it in this department.

43:27.730 --> 43:28.814
I apologize...

43:31.692 --> 43:35.112
for any misunderstanding that may have
been due to my own miscalculation.

43:38.574 --> 43:41.535
Neal, I want to thank you
for your support today.

43:41.827 --> 43:43.662
I hope I was able to give a portion back.

43:44.204 --> 43:45.080
You were, Captain.

43:47.708 --> 43:48.626
What'd he say?

43:49.668 --> 43:51.378
He said I was too good for my partner.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.590
Hey, everybody knows that.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.010
Let me tell you about Gann and Leyton.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.095
Aw, it doesn't matter.

44:01.263 --> 44:02.097
What doesn't?

44:05.643 --> 44:06.727
What happened out there.

44:07.603 --> 44:09.188
Who shot who, why.

44:12.232 --> 44:13.359
Yeah, it matters.

44:14.610 --> 44:17.613
But once you start wondering, man,

44:17.696 --> 44:19.448
you see it everywhere, anyway.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.241
It just drives you crazy.

44:21.533 --> 44:22.618
It really does.

44:24.953 --> 44:27.623
You think
I've been crazy out there, cowboy?

44:27.706 --> 44:30.459
No. You're sane.
You're the sanest one out there.

44:30.542 --> 44:32.628
Just keep movin' along.

44:32.711 --> 44:35.756
Just keep doing your job.

44:36.131 --> 44:39.968
Keep saying, "hello," "goodbye,"
"pass the salt."

44:41.804 --> 44:44.181
You know what racism is?
It ain't just hatred.

44:44.264 --> 44:46.392
Ye-yeah, yeah, it's hatred,

44:47.142 --> 44:49.603
and it's things people do,
but it's also...

44:50.646 --> 44:52.314
It's what you got to think about.

44:53.065 --> 44:54.358
Some damn thing happens out there,

44:54.441 --> 44:56.694
you just can't keep saying,
"Well, what went down?"

45:00.823 --> 45:02.574
Somebody like Mason
starts asking questions,

45:02.658 --> 45:05.202
you want to pretend that he's crazy
for thinking that way.

45:05.285 --> 45:08.288
And then some White guy
starts looking at the Black guys funny,

45:08.372 --> 45:11.250
wondering, "What the hell are they
stirring up all that trouble for?"

45:12.793 --> 45:16.046
Then the Black guys
start looking at White guys

45:16.338 --> 45:19.091
that they know,
brother officers, partners,

45:19.675 --> 45:23.011
just because they're White,
they don't know what it's like.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.307
And then you get angry, man.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.853
You get angry
because the White guys don't see.

45:31.729 --> 45:36.400
And you get angry at yourself
because you can't stop seeing it.

45:36.942 --> 45:37.985
Well, you know...

45:39.194 --> 45:41.321
You're angry at me, right? You're angry.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.489
Aw, no.

45:44.616 --> 45:45.743
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45:48.328 --> 45:49.288
Maybe I was.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.043
Damn thing is when you--

45:55.419 --> 45:57.546
you got to keep thinking about it when...

45:58.505 --> 46:02.801
all you really want to do
is live your life.

46:05.637 --> 46:06.472
Yeah.

46:07.306 --> 46:09.266
It's hard enough
just to live your life, man.

46:10.934 --> 46:11.810
Yeah, it is.

46:18.734 --> 46:19.610
Mrs. Leyton.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.653
Detective Washington.

46:29.703 --> 46:30.537
I just...

46:32.372 --> 46:33.916
-I just wanted to tell you that--
-Yes?

46:36.460 --> 46:37.878
You might hear some things...

46:39.171 --> 46:41.089
about the circumstances
of your son's death.

46:41.632 --> 46:42.508
Yes.

46:42.883 --> 46:45.677
About... racial problems

46:45.761 --> 46:48.847
and... some other things.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.849
I wouldn't pay any of it any mind.

46:50.933 --> 46:52.059
Not any of it.

46:55.103 --> 46:55.938
I'm sorry.

46:57.564 --> 46:58.941
You know what I'm sorry?

47:00.984 --> 47:03.779
I'm sorry you ever helped my son be a cop.

47:07.574 --> 47:08.408
Me too.

47:26.510 --> 47:27.636
(engine turns over)

47:42.150 --> 47:45.153
(closing theme playing)
