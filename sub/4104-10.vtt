00:02.145 --> 00:03.605
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:04.897 --> 00:07.442
- Bellamy, stop!
- He deserves to die!

00:07.609 --> 00:10.028
No! We don't decide
who lives and dies!

00:10.194 --> 00:12.572
We banish him.

00:12.739 --> 00:15.241
I think we got off to a rough start,

00:15.408 --> 00:17.088
but we want to find
a way to live together.

00:17.243 --> 00:20.038
You started a war
that you don't know how to end.

00:21.497 --> 00:22.874
There's Grounders in the trees.

00:23.041 --> 00:24.751
Clarke, run! Run!

00:27.378 --> 00:29.714
Don't stop till you get behind
your walls! Go. Take her!

00:29.881 --> 00:31.174
- Lincoln, no!
- Go!

00:31.341 --> 00:34.719
If we weren't at war already,
we sure as hell are now.

00:37.055 --> 00:38.681
The Exodus ship?

00:38.848 --> 00:42.268
Wait. Something is wrong.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.801
Clarke shouldn't be out here.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.679
Her mom was on the ship.
She's looking for answers.

01:17.845 --> 01:21.099
You want to help her,
find me the black box,

01:21.265 --> 01:24.852
hard drives, anything that will
explain why the ship crashed.

01:30.483 --> 01:32.026
Stay sharp.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.946
Grounder retaliation for what
happened on the bridge is coming,

01:35.113 --> 01:37.657
- just a matter of when.
- Can you blame them?

01:37.824 --> 01:39.944
- No, I blame you.
- Maybe if you didn't bring guns...

01:39.992 --> 01:43.329
If we didn't bring guns,
we all would've been killed.

01:43.496 --> 01:45.748
Why they're coming
doesn't matter anymore.

01:45.915 --> 01:47.959
It's our job to be ready
when they do.

01:48.126 --> 01:50.128
We're on our own now.

01:59.929 --> 02:01.931
Clarke, stop!

02:04.392 --> 02:07.645
- Rocket fuel?
- Hydrazine.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.106
Highly unstable
in its non-solid form.

02:10.273 --> 02:13.651
If this stuff meets fire,
we're all pink mist.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.238
Fire in the hole!

02:23.661 --> 02:27.457
- We need to clear the area.
- Okay, then.

02:27.623 --> 02:31.210
We move in formation,
no straggling, weapons hot.

02:31.377 --> 02:34.046
We got to get back before dark.

02:48.352 --> 02:51.564
Hey. No sign of your brother
or the others yet?

02:51.731 --> 02:54.817
Hey. I don't care.

02:57.904 --> 03:02.074
Jasper, tell us again, how'd you stay
so calm? I would've been terrified.

03:02.241 --> 03:04.994
Fear is only a problem
if you let it stop you, right?

03:05.161 --> 03:07.371
That's not even his line.
Finn said that.

03:07.538 --> 03:11.793
I saw the Grounders in the trees.
It was like nothing I ever felt.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.045
Pure animal instinct took over.

03:14.212 --> 03:17.215
One pull of the trigger,
two Grounders dead.

03:17.381 --> 03:20.885
"Pure animal instinct"?
More like pure pants-wetting panic.

03:21.052 --> 03:23.280
You don't really know what you're
made of until a moment like that,

03:23.304 --> 03:25.973
you know, when it's kill or be killed
and there's just nothing

03:26.140 --> 03:27.892
between you and the tip of a spear.

03:28.059 --> 03:31.979
- Okay. This has to stop.
- Come on. Let us have this.

03:32.146 --> 03:34.899
- Us?
- Look at him.

03:35.066 --> 03:38.027
The boy is a folk hero.

03:38.194 --> 03:39.904
They even gave us a bigger tent.

03:42.114 --> 03:43.794
- Somebody hit the trip wire!
- Which wire?

03:43.950 --> 03:47.119
- Was it a Grounder?
- I don't see anything.

03:47.286 --> 03:48.746
<i>Are you sure it was the trip wire?</i>

03:48.913 --> 03:52.083
- I got nothing. Connor?
- Nothing.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.253
- Something moved!
- There, there, there!

03:57.797 --> 03:59.715
Think I got him. Let's go.

04:00.758 --> 04:02.552
Lincoln.

04:07.056 --> 04:09.100
Hey, slow down.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.314
Octavia, be careful.

04:26.576 --> 04:28.494
Oh, my God.

04:28.744 --> 04:31.539
No way.

04:33.124 --> 04:34.917
Murphy?

04:47.972 --> 04:49.640
Where is he?

04:56.105 --> 05:00.443
Everyone but Connor and Derek out.
Now!

05:00.610 --> 05:02.278
He claims he was with the Grounders.

05:02.445 --> 05:04.822
We caught him trying
to sneak back into camp.

05:04.989 --> 05:06.782
I wasn't sneaking.

05:06.949 --> 05:09.160
I was running from the Grounders.

05:09.327 --> 05:12.663
- Anyone see Grounders?
- Mm-mm.

05:13.539 --> 05:15.517
- Well, in that case...
- What the hell is wrong with you?

05:15.541 --> 05:17.501
We were clear what would happen
if he came back.

05:17.668 --> 05:19.128
No! If he was with the Grounders,

05:19.295 --> 05:20.775
then he knows things
that can help us.

05:20.880 --> 05:24.300
Help us? We hanged him, we banished
him, and now we're gonna kill him.

05:24.467 --> 05:27.970
- Get the hell out of my way.
- No. Finn is right.

05:28.137 --> 05:31.057
Like hell, he is!
Clarke, think about Charlotte.

05:31.223 --> 05:33.809
I am thinking about her,

05:33.976 --> 05:36.729
but what happened to Charlotte
was as much our fault as his.

05:39.190 --> 05:43.319
He's not lying.
His fingernails were torn off.

05:43.486 --> 05:44.570
They tortured him.

05:44.737 --> 05:46.530
You and the Grounders
should compare notes.

05:46.697 --> 05:50.409
The Grounders know we're at war.
What did you tell them about us?

05:51.953 --> 05:53.454
Everything.

06:00.044 --> 06:02.088
Once he's better,
we find out what he knows,

06:02.254 --> 06:05.424
- and then he's out of here, okay?
- What if he refuses to leave?

06:05.591 --> 06:07.718
What do we do with him then?

06:11.055 --> 06:12.890
Then we kill him.

06:23.109 --> 06:24.819
Hey, Jasper.

06:26.028 --> 06:27.947
You're on in 15.

06:28.114 --> 06:32.618
- In case you're hungry.
- Thanks. Be right out.

06:34.412 --> 06:36.163
I like your tent.

06:37.081 --> 06:41.252
Maybe I could come by after your
shift, hear about the bridge again.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.422
Um...

06:44.630 --> 06:46.048
I'm actually busy later.

06:47.425 --> 06:50.720
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

06:50.886 --> 06:52.096
Some other time, then.

06:53.139 --> 06:54.640
See you.

06:57.768 --> 06:59.478
Are you kidding me?

06:59.645 --> 07:01.522
That was there for the taking.

07:01.689 --> 07:05.317
Harper? She's low-hanging fruit.

07:05.484 --> 07:08.946
Don't tell me you're still
holding out for Octavia.

07:09.113 --> 07:12.658
- I got to go.
- Jasper, Octavia is not gonna happen.

07:12.825 --> 07:16.328
- She likes her Grounders alive.
- Go float yourself, Monty.

07:18.122 --> 07:20.842
- I'm just telling you the truth.
- No, you're telling me your truth.

07:24.795 --> 07:26.005
I'm not like you anymore.

07:27.923 --> 07:31.010
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means you're jealous,

07:31.177 --> 07:33.846
and people think I'm cool,
and that upsets you.

07:34.013 --> 07:37.892
I think you're cool, only no one
had to die for me to see it.

07:40.186 --> 07:43.939
You know what?
This is my tent, okay?

07:44.106 --> 07:47.359
Bellamy gave it to me, and
if you have a problem with that,

07:47.526 --> 07:50.154
maybe you should find
somewhere else to sleep.

07:52.073 --> 07:53.074
Maybe I should.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.618
- Then do it.
- I will.

07:55.785 --> 07:57.495
Good.

08:14.678 --> 08:18.474
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't know anyone was in here.

08:18.641 --> 08:19.975
You okay?

08:22.394 --> 08:25.272
- Yeah.
- Still nothing from the Ark.

08:25.439 --> 08:28.400
It's like they shut it down
from their side.

08:28.567 --> 08:31.654
It could be solar flares
blocking the signal.

08:31.821 --> 08:36.325
- But you don't think so.
- I got a bad feeling.

08:39.035 --> 08:41.371
There's a lot of that going around.

08:44.207 --> 08:45.918
Clarke, wait.

08:49.130 --> 08:50.589
I'm sorry about your mom.

08:53.551 --> 08:56.679
Oh, my God!
Clarke, your eyes.

08:58.597 --> 09:00.015
Clarke!

09:01.142 --> 09:03.519
Where's Clarke?

09:04.270 --> 09:05.354
- Clarke.
- Connor?

09:05.521 --> 09:08.232
- It won't stop.
- Clarke!

09:09.608 --> 09:11.360
What's happening?

09:17.408 --> 09:21.370
- Raven, get away from us.
- What?

09:21.537 --> 09:24.373
We're the ones
who brought Murphy in.

09:30.921 --> 09:34.091
Murphy, hey, look at me.

09:34.258 --> 09:36.969
I need you to tell me exactly
how you escaped from the Grounders.

09:37.136 --> 09:40.806
- What happened?
- I don't know. I woke up,

09:40.973 --> 09:42.253
and they forgot to lock my cage.

09:42.391 --> 09:44.643
There was no one there,
so I took off.

09:47.605 --> 09:48.939
They let you go.

09:51.108 --> 09:52.109
Bellamy, stay back.

09:53.736 --> 09:55.821
Did he do something to you?

09:59.241 --> 10:00.242
What the hell is this?

10:05.956 --> 10:08.375
Biological warfare.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.045
You were waiting for the Grounders
to retaliate for the bridge?

10:11.212 --> 10:13.339
This is it.

10:13.505 --> 10:15.549
Murphy is the weapon.

10:23.182 --> 10:26.644
Is this your revenge,
helping the Grounders kill us?

10:26.810 --> 10:30.648
- I didn't know about this, I swear.
- Stop lying!

10:30.814 --> 10:34.568
- When are they coming?
- Murphy, think, all right?

10:34.735 --> 10:38.739
What can you tell us that's useful?
Did you hear anything?

10:38.906 --> 10:41.784
They are vicious, cruel.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.745
- You want to see vicious?
- Hey, don't.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.164
Whatever this thing is,
it spreads through contact.

10:47.331 --> 10:48.832
Clarke?

10:48.999 --> 10:52.169
Finn, you shouldn't be in here.
No one should.

10:52.336 --> 10:53.337
I heard you were sick.

10:56.465 --> 10:59.468
Clarke, what is this?

10:59.635 --> 11:03.555
I don't know,
some kind of hemorrhagic fever.

11:03.722 --> 11:05.474
We just need to contain it before...

11:09.853 --> 11:14.024
Hey, don't touch me. You could
get sick. Wash your hands now.

11:15.859 --> 11:18.279
- What the hell is happening to him?
- I don't know.

11:28.706 --> 11:30.374
Is he...

11:32.209 --> 11:33.210
He's dead.

11:43.304 --> 11:47.057
Here. Alcohol.
Hold out your hand.

11:49.893 --> 11:53.439
- What do we do?
- Quarantine.

11:53.605 --> 11:57.568
Round up everyone who had contact
with Murphy. Bring them here.

11:58.402 --> 12:03.407
- And everyone they had contact with?
- Well, we have to start somewhere.

12:03.574 --> 12:06.910
Connor, who was with you
when you found him?

12:07.077 --> 12:09.997
Who carried him in?
Think.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.710
The first one there was Octavia.

12:33.604 --> 12:36.940
- Jeez, you scared me.
- How are you feeling?

12:37.107 --> 12:39.485
Fine. Get out.

12:39.651 --> 12:43.864
- Did you touch Murphy yesterday?
- What?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.824
Did you touch Murphy yesterday?

12:46.950 --> 12:49.620
I don't know.
I guess so. Why?

12:49.787 --> 12:52.206
The Grounders sent him here
with a virus to infect us.

12:52.373 --> 12:55.042
Derek just died from it,

12:55.209 --> 12:57.878
another mark for your
boyfriend's book.

12:59.171 --> 13:01.799
Get up.
Clarke needs to examine you.

13:14.186 --> 13:16.647
Okay. We're done.

13:17.648 --> 13:19.566
No visible signs of swelling
or bleeding.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.235
So you're saying she doesn't have it?

13:21.402 --> 13:24.530
I'm saying she doesn't have symptoms,
but that could change.

13:24.696 --> 13:26.657
We need to keep her here,
just in case.

13:26.824 --> 13:30.077
No way. Look at this place.
She'll get sick just being here.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.496
Do you want to stop
the spread or not?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.374
Look, I'll keep her
on the third level

13:35.541 --> 13:37.501
with the people who
aren't symptomatic yet.

13:37.668 --> 13:39.962
Think of it as a way to stop her
from sneaking out again.

13:40.129 --> 13:42.506
Screw you, Clarke.

13:42.673 --> 13:45.843
I'll let you know
if her condition changes.

13:48.846 --> 13:50.848
Octavia, wait.

13:52.516 --> 13:54.476
I need you to sneak out again.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.569
Lincoln?

14:06.029 --> 14:07.698
Lincoln.

14:15.747 --> 14:16.832
You knew.

14:18.750 --> 14:22.921
I tried to get you out of there.
You not see the flower?

14:23.088 --> 14:25.299
I saw it.

14:25.466 --> 14:29.052
Right before I found the kid
your people sent to infect us.

14:29.219 --> 14:32.306
People are dying, Lincoln.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.726
Clarke sent me here for the cure.

14:37.394 --> 14:38.687
There is no cure.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.693
So you were just gonna
let my people die?

14:44.860 --> 14:47.863
- You were gonna let me die?
- The sickness passes quickly.

14:48.030 --> 14:51.074
Few are immune.
We use it to soften the battlefield.

14:51.241 --> 14:54.328
I am not surprised
you are one of the strong ones.

14:54.495 --> 14:55.787
The battlefield?

15:03.378 --> 15:05.839
They attack at first light.

15:08.592 --> 15:10.469
You're gonna have
to help me save them.

15:10.636 --> 15:14.890
I can't. I tried.
My people think I'm a traitor now.

15:15.057 --> 15:18.101
Because of the bridge?
You were just trying to make peace.

15:18.268 --> 15:21.355
It's not the bridge.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.443
Because of me?

15:33.408 --> 15:34.993
That doesn't matter now.

15:35.160 --> 15:40.249
I'm leaving, Octavia, right now.

15:40.999 --> 15:43.627
I want you to come with me.

15:44.753 --> 15:47.339
- And go where?
- East.

15:47.506 --> 15:51.802
To the sea, then across it.
There's a clan, allies of the woods.

15:51.969 --> 15:54.012
They'll take us.

15:56.598 --> 15:58.118
I can't just
let my brother get killed.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.519
There is nothing
you can do to stop that now.

16:00.686 --> 16:03.647
- I can warn them.
- Octavia, they'll kill you.

16:05.816 --> 16:08.569
- If you're there at dawn...
- I won't be.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.904
Just wait for me here.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.282
I'm coming with you.

16:41.435 --> 16:45.731
All right. Show's over.
Get back to your posts.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.445
You got enough food in there, water?

16:51.612 --> 16:54.990
Yeah. Some medicine might be nice.

16:56.617 --> 16:57.868
I'll see what I can do.

17:01.038 --> 17:03.498
Octavia, you okay?

17:06.001 --> 17:07.794
Bellamy, wait.

17:07.961 --> 17:10.130
She's not here.

17:11.089 --> 17:13.300
I sent her to see Lincoln.

17:15.719 --> 17:18.972
Look. If there's a cure, he has it.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.224
I didn't tell you because
I knew you wouldn't let her go.

17:22.392 --> 17:26.605
If anything happens to her,
you and me are gonna have problems.

17:26.771 --> 17:29.775
Bellamy. Bellamy!

17:29.941 --> 17:31.735
Out of my way.

17:32.694 --> 17:34.655
- Dude, your eyes.
- Nobody touch him!

17:34.821 --> 17:38.158
Get to the dropship, now.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.244
Are you okay?

17:44.247 --> 17:46.083
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, it's on me!

17:46.249 --> 17:48.585
Get away! Get back! Get back!

17:49.961 --> 17:51.588
Calm down!

17:53.131 --> 17:54.925
Put that gun down!
Put it down!

18:05.394 --> 18:08.271
This is exactly
what the Grounders want.

18:08.438 --> 18:10.273
Don't you see that?

18:10.440 --> 18:13.110
They don't have to kill us
if we kill each other first.

18:13.276 --> 18:15.529
They won't have to kill us
if we all catch the virus.

18:15.696 --> 18:17.948
Get back in the damn dropship!

18:21.118 --> 18:25.288
Not to state the obvious,
but your quarantine isn't working.

18:27.249 --> 18:29.084
Finn, don't touch her!

18:31.002 --> 18:33.797
Hey, let me go. I'm okay.

18:33.964 --> 18:35.090
No, you're not.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.637
- Octavia will come back with a cure.
- There is no cure.

18:43.014 --> 18:45.058
But the Grounders
don't use the sickness to kill.

18:45.225 --> 18:48.687
Really?
Tell that to them.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.691
I warned you about
seeing that Grounder again.

18:52.858 --> 18:57.529
Yeah? Well,
I have a warning for you, too.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.032
The Grounders are coming.

19:02.868 --> 19:04.911
And they're attacking at first light.

19:13.336 --> 19:16.965
Come on. I'll help you get Clarke
into the dropship.

19:20.844 --> 19:23.263
How many bullets can
you make by first light?

19:28.310 --> 19:30.771
What do I have to do to stop you
from coming in here?

19:32.606 --> 19:34.983
- Get better.
- If he's not sick by now,

19:35.150 --> 19:37.319
- then he's probably immune like me.
- Here.

19:37.486 --> 19:38.862
Come on, she can take mine.

19:46.912 --> 19:50.582
- What else did Lincoln tell you?
- The virus doesn't last long.

19:50.749 --> 19:53.293
It's true. I feel better.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.213
They need to stay hydrated.

19:56.379 --> 19:57.547
You need to stay hydrated.

20:02.052 --> 20:03.261
Okay. Them, too.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.890
Please?

20:08.225 --> 20:11.102
It's okay. I'll do it. Just rest.

20:11.269 --> 20:12.896
I'll help you.

20:18.026 --> 20:19.820
You need to save yourselves.

20:19.986 --> 20:23.114
Just leave camp.
Take anyone healthy enough with you.

20:23.281 --> 20:25.992
If you think that's
even a possibility,

20:26.159 --> 20:27.285
you don't know me very well.

20:29.830 --> 20:31.206
I know you.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.422
Look, at this rate,
when the Grounders get here,

20:39.589 --> 20:41.189
there won't be anyone
left to fight back.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.843
That's the point.

20:46.221 --> 20:48.098
Then we slow them down.

20:49.766 --> 20:52.606
There's five to a clip. Let's go.
We need to get these guns on the wall.

20:52.644 --> 20:54.938
- Why just five?
- We're running out of gunpowder.

20:55.105 --> 20:58.942
- We're so dead.
- Don't worry. I got your back.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.029
- Got something to say?
- Hey, guys, stay focused.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.991
We're doing good. We need as many
rounds done by dawn as we can.

21:06.157 --> 21:09.202
It won't matter if there's
no one left who can shoot.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.787
What do we need to build a bomb?

21:10.954 --> 21:13.164
Depends on what you're
trying to blow up.

21:13.331 --> 21:16.209
- How about a bridge?
- What are you talking about?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.229
Murphy says he crossed a bridge
on his way back here

21:18.253 --> 21:20.171
from the Grounders' camp.
Sound familiar?

21:20.338 --> 21:23.466
- Yeah. So what?
- So the virus is fast.

21:23.633 --> 21:24.801
He's already getting better.

21:24.968 --> 21:26.568
Blowing the bridge
won't stop the attack,

21:26.595 --> 21:29.556
but the longer we can delay it,
the more of us will be able to fight.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.475
Even if Murphy is telling the truth,
and that's a big if,

21:32.642 --> 21:35.312
that bridge has survived a nuclear
war and 97 years of weather.

21:36.855 --> 21:38.982
It won't survive me.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.342
Please don't let me blow up.

22:29.991 --> 22:31.868
Okay! You can come in now!

22:42.170 --> 22:46.257
- Boom!
- That's cute.

22:46.424 --> 22:50.553
Relax. It needs an accelerant.
Gunpowder.

22:53.181 --> 22:55.183
Container of hydrazine.

22:57.268 --> 23:01.106
Put the gunpowder
around the hydrazine.

23:05.568 --> 23:06.820
Hit the bull's-eye.

23:10.991 --> 23:13.034
Win a prize.

23:13.201 --> 23:15.888
It's the rest of our gunpowder.
Won't be able to make any more bullets.

23:15.912 --> 23:20.083
Tonight, we need a bomb.
We can worry about bullets tomorrow.

23:20.250 --> 23:24.462
If we do this and it doesn't work,
we'll all be dead tomorrow.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.636
Then let's make sure it works.

23:31.803 --> 23:35.181
To be safe, you need to be at least
200 feet away to make the shot.

23:35.348 --> 23:38.309
No problem.
Which one of you plants the bomb?

23:43.273 --> 23:44.274
I will.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.820
You won't pick up a gun, but blowing
people up, that you're okay with?

23:48.987 --> 23:51.340
We're blowing up a bridge.
There's not gonna be any people on it.

23:51.364 --> 23:52.615
Finn, we have one bomb.

23:52.782 --> 23:55.702
We need to use it to kill as many
of those bastards as possible.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.471
But they don't know
we only have one bomb.

23:57.495 --> 23:59.456
If we did, why would we
waste it on the bridge?

23:59.622 --> 24:02.333
I'm talking about deterrents,
peace through strength.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.878
The appearance of strength, you mean.

24:06.171 --> 24:07.172
Yeah.

24:07.338 --> 24:11.384
Men who built the A-bomb
thought they were peacemakers, too.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.927
How'd that work out for them?

24:17.140 --> 24:19.434
Don't touch anything.

24:20.935 --> 24:25.231
- Who else can take a shot?
- Appreciate the concern.

24:25.398 --> 24:28.610
Make sure the bomb is packed
and ready to go in ten minutes.

24:39.454 --> 24:42.999
Jasper, come here.

24:43.166 --> 24:47.003
Hi. You need me to go
with you to the bridge again?

24:50.924 --> 24:52.050
I need you to take the shot.

24:57.180 --> 25:00.767
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Don't you have jobs to do?

25:04.270 --> 25:07.982
If you miss,
if that bridge doesn't blow,

25:08.149 --> 25:12.237
we're all dead.
You got that?

25:13.029 --> 25:17.283
Hey, why me?
I mean, you've got 20 shooters.

25:19.244 --> 25:23.289
- I'm the only one not sick, right?
- Right.

25:25.208 --> 25:26.668
Don't miss.

25:33.925 --> 25:36.719
- Bellamy!
- No.

25:36.886 --> 25:40.431
Stay back.
Make the shot.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.810
Find Finn. Go.

25:47.939 --> 25:51.234
Hey, don't just stand there.
Get him into the dropship.

25:58.741 --> 26:00.243
- Hey, Murphy!
- Yeah?

26:00.410 --> 26:02.263
Clarke says when that happens
to roll him on his side.

26:02.287 --> 26:03.621
I'm on it.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.918
Come on.
Come on, get on your side.

26:09.085 --> 26:13.798
You're okay. You're okay, all right?
I got you. Okay, okay. Just breathe.

26:15.967 --> 26:17.927
All right, listen to me.
You and me are good.

26:18.094 --> 26:21.139
All right, just breathe.
That's better.

26:21.306 --> 26:25.560
I put the rope around your neck.
Why are you helping me?

26:25.727 --> 26:26.936
Bygones.

26:31.065 --> 26:32.817
Bell? No.

26:32.984 --> 26:36.070
Clear some space!
Lay him down!

26:36.237 --> 26:38.114
Bell!

26:43.870 --> 26:47.123
Hey, big brother.

26:49.792 --> 26:51.377
I'm scared.

26:52.921 --> 26:56.507
I won't let anything happen to you,
I promise.

26:58.259 --> 27:00.637
That's what I said to you
the day you were born.

27:00.803 --> 27:04.307
I know. You told me that,
like, a thousand times.

27:10.355 --> 27:12.315
I'm glad you're here.

27:13.983 --> 27:16.319
Just get some rest now, okay?

27:31.668 --> 27:35.588
- Hey, Finn.
- It's gone.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.924
- Monty, where's Raven?
- She left a while ago.

27:39.092 --> 27:42.720
The bomb.
She's planting it herself.

27:47.684 --> 27:51.938
- You want to come?
- Why don't you ask your new friends?

27:52.105 --> 27:54.899
Jasper, let's go!

28:18.006 --> 28:20.008
Thank God.

28:48.411 --> 28:50.079
Here.

28:50.246 --> 28:53.249
- Get the hell away from me.
- Bellamy, you're sick, okay?

28:53.416 --> 28:56.336
I'm just trying to help. Here.

29:02.925 --> 29:05.678
When I get better,
if you're still here...

29:05.845 --> 29:08.931
Hey, I got this one.

29:17.231 --> 29:18.691
Here.

29:21.444 --> 29:24.655
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

29:26.616 --> 29:28.368
That's good.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.788
You seen Octavia?

29:31.954 --> 29:34.374
She was up all night helping people.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.543
- Murphy gave her a break.
- Don't tell me you trust him now.

29:37.710 --> 29:40.463
Trust? No.

29:41.672 --> 29:44.050
I do believe
in second chances, though.

29:47.678 --> 29:50.807
It's almost dawn.
Better get everyone inside.

29:50.973 --> 29:53.768
If we lock the doors, maybe the
Grounders will think we're not home.

29:53.935 --> 29:56.729
- Not everyone is sick.
- Sick is better than dead.

29:58.648 --> 30:00.768
You don't think Finn and Jasper
are gonna pull it off.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.902
Do you?

30:06.030 --> 30:08.199
I'll get everyone inside.

30:37.437 --> 30:39.397
Thank God.

30:53.119 --> 30:56.956
So simple.
You can do this.

31:07.216 --> 31:10.595
- Do you hear that?
- War drums.

31:11.888 --> 31:15.683
We're running toward the war drums?
I hate this plan.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.956
Raven!

31:40.917 --> 31:42.543
She's still building the bomb.

31:42.710 --> 31:45.379
Hey, Finn, wait. No.
She's got this.

31:55.431 --> 31:58.184
- No. Oh, no.
- Raven, get out of there now!

31:58.351 --> 32:00.603
Line up the shot.

32:17.411 --> 32:18.955
Raven!

32:29.298 --> 32:30.883
Hey, okay.

32:32.260 --> 32:33.344
Come on. Come on.

32:37.098 --> 32:39.141
- Is the bomb ready?
- Yeah.

32:48.150 --> 32:51.070
Shoot, Jasper! Shoot! Shoot!

33:07.295 --> 33:10.006
Damn it. Damn it.

33:15.177 --> 33:17.555
- You call that shooting?
- Monty?

33:17.722 --> 33:20.224
- Last time was a fluke. I panicked.
- So what?

33:20.391 --> 33:23.352
- You still made the shot, right?
- Twice.

33:23.519 --> 33:26.188
- How many rounds?
- Three.

33:27.732 --> 33:29.525
You got this.

33:39.535 --> 33:40.995
Damn it.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.793
Come on.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.548
Did you not hear me say you got this?

34:14.320 --> 34:15.362
They did it.

34:25.081 --> 34:30.210
"I am become death,
destroyer of worlds."

34:32.463 --> 34:35.257
It's Oppenheimer,
the man who built the first...

34:35.424 --> 34:38.219
I know who Oppenheimer is.

34:55.277 --> 34:56.946
We had to stop the attack.

34:59.699 --> 35:01.951
Look, there is so much
you don't understand.

35:02.118 --> 35:04.054
The mountain men, they'll come,
and they'll kill us all.

35:04.078 --> 35:07.123
We have to get out of here
while we still got the chance.

35:07.289 --> 35:09.542
The mountain men?

35:09.709 --> 35:12.044
You mean,
the drawings in your book?

35:13.546 --> 35:15.423
Yeah.

35:15.589 --> 35:19.135
Now, let's go. We got a lot of ground
to cover before dark.

35:20.803 --> 35:21.971
I'm not going with you.

36:01.343 --> 36:03.554
You'll die here.

36:03.721 --> 36:05.556
Maybe.

36:08.058 --> 36:09.101
Why?

36:10.519 --> 36:14.440
You just said it.
They're my people.

36:22.156 --> 36:23.908
I'm sorry.

36:40.049 --> 36:42.176
Goodbye, Lincoln.

36:56.065 --> 36:59.443
There! It's them!
Open the gate!

37:09.286 --> 37:11.539
Don't let it get to your head.

37:41.235 --> 37:42.278
She's getting stronger.

38:01.964 --> 38:04.633
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:06.844 --> 38:08.012
You saved my life.

38:08.178 --> 38:10.639
Wouldn't have had to
if you didn't take the bomb.

38:13.309 --> 38:16.645
- You hesitated.
- What?

38:18.105 --> 38:22.109
When Bellamy asked
who was gonna take it,

38:22.276 --> 38:25.237
you hesitated.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.656
It's what people do
when they're considering

38:27.823 --> 38:29.992
something that might blow them up, right?

38:30.159 --> 38:32.077
You didn't hesitate
when Clarke was falling.

38:34.622 --> 38:37.333
You knew she had the virus,
but you caught her, anyway.

38:37.499 --> 38:40.002
- Raven...
- You didn't hesitate.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.508
Raven, I love you.

38:47.968 --> 38:50.846
Not the way that I want to be loved.

38:53.349 --> 38:55.935
Not the way that you love Clarke.

39:20.542 --> 39:22.670
It's over, Finn.

39:46.735 --> 39:48.988
You're outside of the wall
without a gun.

39:52.992 --> 39:54.243
Fourteen graves.

39:56.912 --> 40:00.416
We need to talk about Murphy.

40:00.582 --> 40:04.503
- He was right about the bridge.
- We'll see.

40:04.670 --> 40:08.298
Octavia says the mountain men
are pissed, whatever that means.

40:08.465 --> 40:12.011
I'd say it means we need
as many soldiers as we can get.

40:12.177 --> 40:15.097
So, what, we have pardon power now?

40:17.391 --> 40:19.393
It's hard running things.

40:26.108 --> 40:28.110
Fourteen.

41:20.829 --> 41:22.748
Bygones.
