00:17.936 --> 00:20.355
Oi, keep it on the road!

00:21.232 --> 00:24.448
I'll come round your house
and stamp on your toys....

00:44.798 --> 00:47.973
<i>Sam? Are you listening, Sam?</i>

00:48.114 --> 00:50.075
<i>I know you can hear me.</i>

00:50.238 --> 00:53.170
<i>We've been monitoring you closely.</i>

00:54.807 --> 00:57.073
<i>Say again, Alpha One?</i>

00:58.286 --> 01:00.713
<i>We know you're still
in there, Sam.</i>

01:02.169 --> 01:04.434
You're right, I'm here,
I'm still here.

01:04.494 --> 01:07.609
<i>But your levels of responsiveness
have decreased recently.</i>

01:07.669 --> 01:09.185
<i>You can't give up, Sam.</i>

01:09.247 --> 01:12.340
<i>Whatever life-blood
is left in your veins, use it.</i>

01:12.461 --> 01:15.353
<i>You </i> must <i>keep fighting.
Keep fighting, Sam.</i>

01:15.411 --> 01:18.872
<i>870, respond? 870!</i>

01:19.876 --> 01:22.642
<i>870, come in, will you!</i>

01:24.857 --> 01:26.653
Phyllis, is that you?

01:26.749 --> 01:29.014
<i>No, it's Jane Fonda
on the hunt for men.</i>

01:29.110 --> 01:30.729
<i>I've got a reported stabbing.</i>

01:30.824 --> 01:32.117
Stabbing? Where?

01:32.182 --> 01:35.951
<i>Crester's Textiles, Queen Mary Road.
Uniform's already on the scene.</i>

01:36.857 --> 01:38.539
Queen Mary Road?

01:38.620 --> 01:40.916
Alpha One,
we're all over it.

01:44.395 --> 01:47.516
This is a one-way street,
so just take a left and...

02:23.408 --> 02:25.414
Right nasty one in there, guv.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.796
I didn't know folk had
that much blood in 'em.

02:34.860 --> 02:37.385
I know, it's a shock, isn't it, eh?

02:38.047 --> 02:42.237
She found him.
And it's horrible, Inspector.

02:42.381 --> 02:45.424
- I don't believe it.
- Sam?

02:46.685 --> 02:50.583
I live here...
I <i>will</i> live here.

02:50.664 --> 02:53.042
- Derek.
- It's alright, Tina.

02:53.511 --> 02:55.970
Dad, it's Jimmy Saunders.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.376
Oh, aye?

02:57.732 --> 02:59.802
Are you coming, or what?

03:03.685 --> 03:05.674
Garage was over there.

03:06.758 --> 03:09.621
There were like,
four apartments on this floor.

03:10.430 --> 03:13.423
This is all gonna be flats
in thirty years.

03:15.833 --> 03:19.149
This is just unbe...lievable.

03:24.164 --> 03:25.894
Trouble at mill.

03:26.057 --> 03:28.564
Loom operator.
Jimmy Saunders.

03:28.645 --> 03:29.745
Shocking stuff.

03:29.858 --> 03:33.045
The only shocking thing is
that this didn't happen sooner.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.578
Under my kitchen table.

03:43.387 --> 03:45.393
He's in my flat.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.821
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

03:48.951 --> 03:52.008
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

03:52.089 --> 03:55.534
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

03:55.632 --> 03:58.981
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

03:59.158 --> 04:02.443
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

05:04.773 --> 05:06.423
It's warm, eh?

05:07.443 --> 05:09.270
Throws you a bit, dunnit?

05:09.675 --> 05:11.745
Hundred years of toil that.

05:11.859 --> 05:14.027
The heat just bleeds
through the brick.

05:14.301 --> 05:16.242
Makes it a living thing.

05:16.421 --> 05:19.689
Living things need to keep
working on the inside.

05:20.384 --> 05:22.293
Once the inside stops...

05:23.538 --> 05:25.285
It's just a shell.

05:25.495 --> 05:26.966
Anyway.

05:29.189 --> 05:31.148
What if you don't catch him?

05:32.991 --> 05:34.254
We will.

05:35.466 --> 05:38.346
<i>Collected enemies like stamps,
did Saunders.</i>

05:38.378 --> 05:39.057
Why?

05:39.122 --> 05:42.131
If the mill's gonna survive into
the next century, it has to modernise.

05:42.179 --> 05:44.493
Saunders was the only fella
ready to adapt.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.320
How do you mean, Mr Coynes?

05:46.402 --> 05:49.395
We're planning to pull out
the old looms. Upgrade 'em.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.255
The new ones
do the work of three men.

05:51.319 --> 05:54.878
- That means the ones that wanna stay...
- Have to prove themselves.

05:54.944 --> 05:57.676
The immigrants, well,
they're a little brown army.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.504
Happy to work triples.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.142
But our lads... different story.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.617
Too gobby
since the unions merged, see.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.929
Saunders thought
they were holding everyone back.

06:06.994 --> 06:11.458
So by working triple shifts,
he was defying the union.

06:11.556 --> 06:13.480
He could see
the way the future lay.

06:13.546 --> 06:15.292
What, and someone
killed him for that?

06:15.422 --> 06:18.528
- So, what happens now?
- Well, we close you down,

06:18.593 --> 06:20.421
We catch the baddie,
open you up again.

06:20.469 --> 06:22.993
Sort it quick, won't you?
It's supposed to be payday today.

06:23.090 --> 06:26.034
They'll go mad.
Place is a powder keg as it is.

06:26.099 --> 06:28.768
You leave it with me.
Take no time at all, sir.

06:35.722 --> 06:38.487
Oi, Mary Mary, shift yourself.
You're in the way.

06:38.537 --> 06:39.927
Let him do his job.

06:40.057 --> 06:42.272
It's a right messy one, this.

06:43.905 --> 06:46.364
- Chris?
- Yeah?

06:46.914 --> 06:49.761
I want you to record the shape
of this blood on the floor.

06:50.974 --> 06:54.307
Blood pattern analysis?
By D.H. Cromby.

06:54.389 --> 06:55.683
I'll wait for the film, thanks.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.173
Oh, you'd like the book.
It's got pictures.

06:58.255 --> 07:01.295
Right. Wounds are at the front
so he was facing his attacker.

07:01.377 --> 07:04.434
No bird would be capable of taking on
a big fella like this head-on.

07:04.514 --> 07:05.809
Killer's male.

07:07.929 --> 07:11.050
Great.
That really narrows it down.

07:11.292 --> 07:14.171
I try and teach him and
he just doesn't learn, does he?

07:14.253 --> 07:17.374
No, guv. Sorry, boss.
No, guv.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.979
Cases like this follow
a certain pattern, boss.

07:20.059 --> 07:21.629
Sure as bacon follows eggs.

07:21.678 --> 07:23.731
Limited number of suspects.
We know it's a bloke,

07:23.780 --> 07:25.706
so it's not a crime of passion.

07:25.819 --> 07:27.242
Unless he's a kinky bloke.

07:27.419 --> 07:29.329
This is a factory,
not a town hall.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.770
No, this is a union bloke
with an axe to grind.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.842
And here's the clincher.

07:34.100 --> 07:38.047
Golden rule in these cases is,
the first one to speak did it.

07:42.154 --> 07:44.014
It was robbery, you know.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.623
There's plenty of lowlife out there
who knew Saunders had dough.

07:47.832 --> 07:49.579
They did it for the cash.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.231
Is that right, Mr...?

07:52.652 --> 07:55.467
Bannister. Ted Bannister.

08:00.544 --> 08:02.616
Let's bring him in
and put him in the canteen.

08:02.696 --> 08:05.381
Morning, gents.
Seen the press?

08:07.581 --> 08:09.830
Just thought
you'd want to see it.

08:14.563 --> 08:17.328
Well, it makes nice headlines,
don't it, Litton?

08:17.425 --> 08:20.209
Regional Crime Squad
actually preventing a robbery

08:20.256 --> 08:22.457
rather than shooting
everyone dead.

08:23.005 --> 08:24.931
Fair's fair, Gene.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.457
I just thought your boys could do
with a little morale boost, is all,

08:28.522 --> 08:30.059
something to aim at.

08:30.188 --> 08:32.210
I can see it's a bad time.

08:32.307 --> 08:36.804
RCS are holding a celebratory do
tomorrow night, if you can make it.

08:37.352 --> 08:38.890
Au revoir.

08:44.244 --> 08:47.867
Right. We've got a juicy murder
and we're gonna nail it today!

08:47.948 --> 08:51.409
Chief culprit is Ted Bannister.
I want him in custody by teatime.

08:51.458 --> 08:54.500
- What, because he spoke first?
- Because he's guilty as sin,

08:54.596 --> 08:56.472
and he's a Commie bastard.

08:56.781 --> 08:59.143
Sorry, it's bollocks.
It's total rubbish.

08:59.208 --> 09:01.957
You're just itching to get your
blood spillage book out, aren't you?

09:02.022 --> 09:05.176
You're making him prime suspect,
based on what, a hunch?

09:05.662 --> 09:09.891
Ray. How many murderers
we banged up in the last two years?

09:10.089 --> 09:10.947
A dozen.

09:11.028 --> 09:13.471
How many times did I know
the killer on first sight?

09:13.519 --> 09:15.137
- All of them.
- Thank you.

09:15.282 --> 09:17.369
Except that old dear
with the squint.

09:17.499 --> 09:19.666
Blimey, that was
a turn up, weren't it?

09:21.316 --> 09:22.432
No.

09:24.244 --> 09:25.231
You what?

09:25.295 --> 09:27.123
Sorry, we have to build up a...

09:27.155 --> 09:29.678
I'm gonna say this, and I know
you're gonna throw things at me,

09:29.728 --> 09:33.384
but we need to build up
a forensic profile. It's...

09:33.479 --> 09:35.695
No way.
This won't get solved in the lab.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.313
I'm pulling forensics out.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.514
Look, think about this logically.

09:39.611 --> 09:44.124
Ted Bannister is twice
the victim's age and clearly unfit.

09:44.204 --> 09:48.038
So you're telling me he could
stroll across a deserted factory floor

09:48.103 --> 09:51.630
and attack Saunders without Saunders
even trying to defend himself.

09:51.694 --> 09:54.202
- You think he's innocent?
- Yes he is, he's innocent.

09:54.283 --> 09:56.741
- Cobblers.
- Tenner says he did it.

09:57.226 --> 10:00.931
- I'm not playing.
- Ten and a Party Seven.

10:01.092 --> 10:03.809
If you think I'm gonna reduce
a murder enquiry

10:03.875 --> 10:06.188
to the level
of a playground bet...

10:06.253 --> 10:11.218
Cowardy cowardy custard,
couldn't cut the mustard.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.418
This is just...

10:13.774 --> 10:15.229
No fight.

10:17.235 --> 10:18.756
No fight?

10:21.441 --> 10:22.913
No fight?

10:33.638 --> 10:36.307
I want this prepped
for mass interviews.

10:36.371 --> 10:38.005
Build a profile
of the mill community.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.865
Who hates who,
who sleeps with who,

10:39.995 --> 10:41.774
you keep a totally open mind
at this juncture.

10:41.855 --> 10:43.586
What, a gang of 'em
all linked in together?

10:43.667 --> 10:44.719
Could be a gang.

10:44.783 --> 10:47.467
Could be a gang of trained eagles.
Could be ninjas for all we know.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.765
No way, boss.
Not ninja style.

10:50.736 --> 10:51.818
Annie.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.329
Blokes at the mill. Cagey lot.

10:55.378 --> 10:57.805
We might get somewhere with
the women. Try get chatty with'em.

10:57.934 --> 11:00.118
All girls together?
Play the solidarity card?

11:00.198 --> 11:03.288
But don't push it. See what happens.
I've squared it with your sergeant.

11:03.385 --> 11:05.714
Under you now, am I?

11:08.271 --> 11:10.131
Thing is, Tyler,

11:10.293 --> 11:13.124
Crime Squad only solve
about three crimes a year.

11:13.204 --> 11:17.281
We, on the other hand,
are always on the go.

11:17.507 --> 11:18.531
This is Dodds.

11:18.653 --> 11:21.462
- Second rate fence, aren't you, Dodds?
- Don't know what you mean.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.830
Plod stopped him for running
a red light. Found these in his boot.

11:24.927 --> 11:28.566
Chalk up another for the boys.
Bang him up, Ray.

11:28.776 --> 11:33.193
This is all very interesting,
but can we stick to the job in hand?

11:33.289 --> 11:34.340
Yes!

11:34.632 --> 11:37.494
Let's go and make mincemeat
of these Bolsheviks.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.662
Right, have I done you lot?

11:39.759 --> 11:42.493
Names then,
one at a flipping time.

11:44.612 --> 11:47.961
- Who's grubby paw is this?
- Alright, alright!

11:52.424 --> 11:53.848
What's your name, love?

11:55.255 --> 11:57.940
Think you've underestimated
the scale of this investigation.

11:58.037 --> 11:59.849
We'll take the bulk
of the statements today

11:59.898 --> 12:02.017
and I'll brief the department
first thing tomorrow morning.

12:02.081 --> 12:04.087
Hang on,
what do you call "first thing"?

12:04.216 --> 12:07.596
I'll also have a resume document
ready at the end of each day.

12:07.775 --> 12:09.549
You're not giving me stuff to read?

12:09.983 --> 12:12.797
Think of it as a back-up
in case you lost your sixth sense.

12:12.878 --> 12:16.969
You like paperwork,
I'll show you paperwork.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.674
Who killed him?

12:21.709 --> 12:22.890
Come on.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.544
Who killed Jimmy Saunders?

12:26.142 --> 12:28.698
A fiver to the one who tells me.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.271
Come on, who killed him?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.720
It was him.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.161
Aye, alright then, I did it.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.200
And this bugger my accomplice.

12:40.669 --> 12:43.532
Thanks for your help.
Take these men into custody.

12:43.985 --> 12:45.070
You're joking!

12:45.134 --> 12:47.948
I never joke
about a confession, sir!

12:48.045 --> 12:50.019
Now, this is not a game!

12:50.149 --> 12:53.917
Jimmy Saunders was brutally
hacked to death last night,

12:54.062 --> 12:56.636
and the killer might well be
standing in this room.

12:56.781 --> 12:59.773
In fact, you know you are.

13:19.361 --> 13:22.273
Mill's dying.
We could all be out anytime.

13:22.338 --> 13:25.265
But at least we're sticking together.
Triple shifts?

13:25.363 --> 13:27.514
Saunders was like
management's dancing bear.

13:27.579 --> 13:31.364
I don't know nothing.
I don't see nothing or hear nothing.

13:31.494 --> 13:34.987
He used to call us mugs.
Said we couldn't see the future.

13:35.138 --> 13:37.425
He didn't give a threepenny bit
what hours he did.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.560
Ted was right to lay one on him.

13:41.431 --> 13:45.329
I wasn't even there.
It was Derek.

13:47.253 --> 13:49.324
There was a fight
in the pub last night.

13:49.388 --> 13:51.411
Dad had a set-to
with Saunders, so?

13:51.556 --> 13:53.271
He were always scrapping.

13:54.272 --> 13:56.310
Saunders had to make
the eight o'clock shift.

13:56.358 --> 13:59.852
He left, me and me dad sunk
a few more, then I left about tennish.

13:59.982 --> 14:02.683
- Your dad hated him.
- Everyone hated him.

14:02.845 --> 14:04.900
Dad always said
there's two types of enemy.

14:05.029 --> 14:08.183
The ones above you,
management and government.

14:08.361 --> 14:10.335
The one to fear is
the other kind:

14:10.496 --> 14:12.809
the enemy
within your own ranks.

14:13.361 --> 14:15.366
Why bother?
Textiles is doomed.

14:15.447 --> 14:16.871
What's the point of fighting it?

14:16.935 --> 14:21.254
Sometimes the fight's the thing.
Without it, you go under.

14:21.659 --> 14:24.583
You're Father of the Union Chapel.

14:24.791 --> 14:28.075
Saunders was a scab.
You hated him.

14:28.206 --> 14:29.517
I've never denied it.

14:29.578 --> 14:33.073
Do you deny having a bellyful of air and
then attacking him in a pub last night?

14:33.120 --> 14:35.855
I didn't attack him,
we came to blows, together.

14:35.935 --> 14:37.538
Did you threaten to kill him?

14:37.601 --> 14:40.562
"You're dead, pal."
My exact words.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.826
How many times
have you heard people say that?

14:42.923 --> 14:45.818
It's been said by men
who've toddled off and done just that.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.522
Killed someone.

14:47.666 --> 14:51.111
- What time'd you leave the pub?
- Just before eleven. I went home.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.811
Are you a fit man, Ted?

14:52.891 --> 14:55.803
I boxed in my prime,
but my prime's way back.

14:55.948 --> 14:59.200
I hear Saunders used to go
running up on the moor.

15:00.024 --> 15:04.030
- Do you do much running?
- What do you think?

15:10.345 --> 15:12.367
- Bloody hell.
- Several wounds.

15:12.415 --> 15:16.023
One to the left shoulder, one to
the chest and two to the right arm.

15:16.152 --> 15:18.545
Have you estimated time of death
from blood temperature?

15:18.644 --> 15:20.973
Sorry.
Pathologist's at a wedding.

15:21.069 --> 15:22.573
It shouldn't pose a problem.

15:22.735 --> 15:25.728
Air temperature's was pretty
consistent in there, weren't it?

15:30.923 --> 15:32.412
Oh, that's pretty.

15:32.509 --> 15:34.687
You should send that
to the gallery on VisionArt.

15:34.741 --> 15:36.115
They can't promise to return it,

15:36.198 --> 15:38.414
but they do give a prize
to all those they show.

15:39.393 --> 15:43.809
The way this is sprayed suggests
an attack carried out at speed.

15:43.923 --> 15:47.627
The size of cut
suggests a long blade.

15:47.869 --> 15:50.667
Like one of them machetes
the coloureds use?

15:50.765 --> 15:54.323
Ray. Can we please call them
the "immigrant workforce"?

15:54.387 --> 15:55.827
Who, the coloureds?

15:55.907 --> 15:58.026
There's a lot of Sheiks
in that mill.

15:58.140 --> 16:00.970
Well, they carry ceremonial daggers
and all that, don't they?

16:01.117 --> 16:02.941
Some bloke could
keep it in his locker.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.606
Bannister gets his hands on it,
Bob's your uncle.

16:05.659 --> 16:07.444
Could we put together
a forensic profile

16:07.483 --> 16:10.641
before you start expanding on
this gripping novel any further, guv?

16:10.693 --> 16:13.385
- We're gonna carry out a fingertip...
- Turn the place over, Ray.

16:13.486 --> 16:15.732
Dig holes.
I want to see a lot of holes.

16:15.852 --> 16:17.901
Talk to the Sheik boys.
Anyone lost a dagger?

16:17.965 --> 16:20.657
- Find me that blade, Ray.
- Consider it done.

16:20.852 --> 16:22.146
What about me, guv?

16:22.340 --> 16:25.562
Make DI Tyler
a potato print.

16:28.008 --> 16:30.001
- I'll go then.
- Hang on.

16:30.752 --> 16:32.782
We'll go through
the night shift statements.

16:32.835 --> 16:34.893
But they get to look
for a big knife!

16:35.048 --> 16:37.248
Anyone can run around
like an 'eadless chicken,

16:37.312 --> 16:42.023
but nothing beats the satisfaction
of a thorough investigative process!

17:04.907 --> 17:06.422
Alright, come on.

17:07.316 --> 17:08.882
Snap out of it!

17:09.016 --> 17:11.681
Motivational speaking now, okay?

17:12.003 --> 17:15.537
We <i>will</i> get results! Say it.

17:17.739 --> 17:19.212
We're winners!

17:20.597 --> 17:22.771
Now roar like lions!

17:23.690 --> 17:26.329
That was a joke, that,
you don't have to do that bit.

17:27.068 --> 17:29.553
Bingo. Got one.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.546
Martin Ellis, lorry driver.

17:31.596 --> 17:34.094
He was waiting for a fabrics pickup
at 2.30 this morning.

17:34.185 --> 17:37.006
Spotted "a thickset man
running out of the loomhall".

17:41.523 --> 17:46.130
Chris. Have you ever seen anybody
who looks like that?

17:46.802 --> 17:48.576
Best we could do.

17:49.547 --> 17:52.407
It's a doddle then. We're looking for
someone with hamster's cheeks,

17:52.433 --> 17:55.513
a nose like Audrey Hepburn
and two foot of forehead.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.338
These are the body parts
they give us.

17:57.584 --> 17:59.796
Is there anybody in this station
that can draw?

18:01.019 --> 18:02.701
What about PC Mallows?

18:02.779 --> 18:05.871
Oh yeah, he does cartoons
of people at the Christmas party!

18:06.142 --> 18:08.369
Okay.
Get Mallows and Ellis together.

18:08.498 --> 18:10.167
Where are you going?

18:10.427 --> 18:12.406
I'm gonna go and check
that the guv...

18:12.504 --> 18:15.693
isn't planting a dagger
in Bannister's locker.

18:16.056 --> 18:17.764
Can I ask you something, boss?

18:17.906 --> 18:19.136
Why do you do it?

18:19.291 --> 18:21.827
Why do you deliberately
get his goat?

18:24.364 --> 18:26.112
I need to fight, Chris.

18:36.262 --> 18:37.499
Annie.

18:38.620 --> 18:41.635
I'll just be a minute, girls.
He's lost his voice.

18:42.826 --> 18:46.567
Got any gum? My mouth
tastes like a pub ashtray.

18:47.032 --> 18:48.364
Excuse me.

18:49.219 --> 18:52.804
Why would anyone turn
a factory into a block of flats?

18:52.900 --> 18:55.229
It's supposed to look nice.

18:55.424 --> 18:59.055
Factories should be factories.
Houses should be houses.

18:59.137 --> 19:03.273
I mean, things are built
for a purpose.  It's ridiculous.

19:03.338 --> 19:06.155
What would them fellas say
if you told them?

19:14.037 --> 19:17.310
Look at this! Guv! No!

19:17.391 --> 19:19.752
Here he comes, smile.

19:19.996 --> 19:23.009
At least keep all the activity
to the sides!

19:23.106 --> 19:26.672
Trampling over everything
like an 'erd of elephants here!

19:31.171 --> 19:33.630
Why's it so damp here?

19:37.684 --> 19:42.145
What are you doing now?
Listening for Indian drums?

19:44.082 --> 19:45.629
There, look.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.348
Yeah, I can see it.

19:58.225 --> 20:00.033
Machine oil.

20:00.276 --> 20:02.947
Stops moisture drying
on the floor.

20:03.109 --> 20:07.212
- This blood's still fresh.
- Hey! How did we miss this!

20:07.391 --> 20:09.654
It's 'cause you let
forensics go too soon.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.644
Calico. Soak up the prints.
There's loads of it over there.

20:27.463 --> 20:29.840
Looks like a size eight, I'd say.

20:32.006 --> 20:33.476
What's that marking?

20:33.607 --> 20:37.417
Annie, radio the station, tell them
to hold anybody not yet processed.

20:37.498 --> 20:39.484
We need shoes sizes.

20:39.582 --> 20:43.180
Look at you, eh.
Proper little CID girl.

20:43.522 --> 20:45.183
There's wet patches all over.

20:45.314 --> 20:48.928
The killer's obviously tried
to cover his tracks,

20:49.025 --> 20:51.370
but he's missed a bit. See?

20:51.484 --> 20:53.845
Gay-boy science has its place.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.613
Here, boss. Check this out.

21:00.276 --> 21:02.588
Why are we looking
at drawings of...

21:04.396 --> 21:06.008
Ted Bannister?

21:06.480 --> 21:08.466
ID from the witness.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.951
You see?
Radar's really wrong.

21:12.114 --> 21:14.638
Done and dusted
by pub opening.

21:27.859 --> 21:29.487
What's going on here?

21:29.618 --> 21:31.946
- Hey! What're you doing?
- Get off him!

21:32.728 --> 21:34.926
What are you doing?
Get off me!

21:35.040 --> 21:37.059
- Get off him!
- Same marking.

21:37.136 --> 21:39.752
Right. I'm arresting you
for murder, Bannister.

21:39.815 --> 21:41.451
Leave him alone,
I'm begging you!

21:41.981 --> 21:44.243
We're looking for a large blade.
Turn the place over.

21:44.285 --> 21:45.848
You can't just
come in here like...

21:45.942 --> 21:48.464
Shut up and
we'll start again, shall we?

21:49.349 --> 21:50.725
What's going on?

21:50.986 --> 21:52.132
That is lovely.

21:53.727 --> 21:54.623
Come on!

21:55.040 --> 21:57.155
- Keep the kids inside.
- Get out!

22:04.663 --> 22:05.559
Dad!

22:07.018 --> 22:08.664
What's going on,
he hasn't done anything!

22:08.695 --> 22:09.946
Get off me, you bastard!

22:10.019 --> 22:11.894
If he's innocent, there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

22:11.936 --> 22:14.406
Just a few lazy coppers
looking for an easy collar!

22:14.479 --> 22:15.500
Easy now, son.

22:16.188 --> 22:17.657
Say sorry.

22:19.616 --> 22:21.492
Say sorry to the man, Derek.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.014
Sorry.

22:24.063 --> 22:26.310
Good.
Now say "Sorry my dad's scum".

22:26.391 --> 22:27.873
Come on, guv.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.517
Sorry my dad's scum.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.732
"Thanks for getting him
off the street."

22:34.857 --> 22:37.235
Thanks for getting him
off the street.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.302
We're dead grateful.

22:42.732 --> 22:44.881
I'll get that tenner off you later.

22:45.484 --> 22:46.851
It's not over yet.

22:46.965 --> 22:49.115
Mad gallop for the finish, is it?

22:49.261 --> 22:51.590
You wanna watch
yourself, Sammy-boy.

22:51.687 --> 22:53.348
I play it rough.

22:56.034 --> 22:59.747
I was told to move this on to DI Tyler
and unless you want a thick ear...

22:59.780 --> 23:01.489
We're in the middle
of a murder enquiry...

23:01.554 --> 23:03.296
I'm not in mood for this.
I've got rotten trapped wind!

23:03.377 --> 23:04.468
What's going on?

23:04.746 --> 23:07.952
I was told to give you the
arresting constable's statements

23:08.010 --> 23:10.037
in connection with Eric Dodds.

23:11.673 --> 23:13.872
The bloke with
the shooters in his boot.

23:14.067 --> 23:17.030
Guv thought you might like
something else to keep you busy.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.994
Is it a problem, boss?

23:20.954 --> 23:24.667
Chris. Get a list of Dodds' regular
suppliers and accomplices.

23:24.716 --> 23:26.312
But we're in the middle
of something.

23:26.377 --> 23:29.356
I'm gonna say two words to you
and they will change your life

23:29.421 --> 23:33.541
and put you on the fast track
to Inspector. Multi. Tasking.

23:34.257 --> 23:36.684
- What you doing?
- Get the guv.

23:42.268 --> 23:45.296
- Interview conducted...
- Is that legal?

23:46.175 --> 23:48.634
Trust me, it's better
than writing it down.

23:49.268 --> 23:53.030
Interview conducted
Wednesday 16th of March.

23:53.111 --> 23:54.626
Present in the room:

23:54.805 --> 23:59.103
Detective Inspector Tyler,
Detective Constable Skelton.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.643
The time, Chris?

24:01.985 --> 24:05.062
- Fourish.
- Precise time.

24:05.290 --> 24:09.312
Just after four.
Five, er... ten past.

24:09.377 --> 24:11.738
4.07.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.604
- It's closer to ten past.
- Thank you, DC Skelton.

24:16.721 --> 24:21.183
Buggeration! One at home always
chews up me girlfriend's Elton John.

24:24.732 --> 24:28.054
DCI Hunt has just
entered the room.

24:28.119 --> 24:29.730
DC Skelton concurs.

24:33.052 --> 24:34.892
Blood on your boot.

24:35.315 --> 24:38.100
The same boot that left a print
at the murder scene.

24:38.197 --> 24:40.314
I stood in some blood.
So what?

24:40.444 --> 24:45.638
Look, these things play out
the same way so often,

24:45.882 --> 24:47.966
it just gets boring.

24:48.927 --> 24:51.435
You hated Saunders
'cause he was a scab,

24:51.516 --> 24:54.756
you got tanked up, you had a fight
and threatened to kill him.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.752
You went to the mill and
carried out a frenzied attack.

24:57.849 --> 24:59.917
Always sounds good
in the papers, that, doesn't it.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.848
"A frenzied attack".

25:03.125 --> 25:06.349
But, on the plus side,

25:06.658 --> 25:09.459
I'm up ten quid
and a Party Seven.

25:09.947 --> 25:14.066
You left the pub just before 11 p.m.,
then you went home.

25:14.164 --> 25:16.231
Can anyone verify that?

25:16.704 --> 25:20.302
Ted? It's really stacking up
against you, here, mate.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.191
You've gotta give me something.

25:22.712 --> 25:25.642
The immigrants, they knuckle under.
They do the triples.

25:25.723 --> 25:27.286
Fair enough, they're grateful.

25:27.417 --> 25:31.536
But Saunders, he betrayed us.
He broke ranks.

25:31.618 --> 25:32.937
The enemy within.

25:33.018 --> 25:34.635
The future's desperate for us.

25:34.744 --> 25:38.303
The whole community could go down
if the mill closes and there's a chance.

25:38.361 --> 25:41.279
But I believe if we stick together,
we've got a chance an' all.

25:41.388 --> 25:42.354
There's hope,

25:42.455 --> 25:45.948
that Crester's could go on for
another 20, 30, 40 years from now.

25:46.277 --> 25:48.947
But we need to fight
shoulder to shoulder.

25:49.061 --> 25:52.497
- You make it sound like a war.
- Yeah, well, maybe it is.

25:52.578 --> 25:55.167
- Worth fighting for.
- Worth dying for.

25:55.232 --> 25:56.681
Worth killing for?

25:56.779 --> 25:58.374
How did you kill him,
by the way?

25:58.472 --> 26:00.459
I told you, I went home.

26:01.501 --> 26:02.640
Liar.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.304
Liar!

26:06.361 --> 26:08.331
I want to see some sort of lawyer.

26:08.380 --> 26:10.236
- A liar?
- A lawyer!

26:10.448 --> 26:11.686
Do you want
a glass of water?

26:11.751 --> 26:13.900
You know you were eyeballed
running away from the mill

26:13.965 --> 26:16.831
around the time of the murder?
And that's not all.

26:19.115 --> 26:21.151
Under the boards
in your garden shed.

26:21.199 --> 26:24.814
Say goodnight, Gracie and
sit down. I said sit down!

26:24.960 --> 26:27.777
You've got to open the mill,
we can't afford to lose this order.

26:27.842 --> 26:30.398
The mill stays shut
until our enquiry is over.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.639
- For God's sake!
- Sit down or I'll sit you down!

26:33.736 --> 26:34.925
Now!

26:57.799 --> 26:58.890
What?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.219
I did it. I killed him.

27:01.349 --> 27:03.433
Like he said, I was drunk.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.741
- How did it happen?
- Went for him.

27:08.904 --> 27:11.558
- What with?
- A knife!

27:11.948 --> 27:13.837
What did you do with it?

27:14.163 --> 27:16.296
I threw it in the canal.

27:16.475 --> 27:19.194
- But not the bloodied shirt.
- That's right.

27:19.341 --> 27:21.261
So where should we
be trawling, Ted?

27:21.327 --> 27:23.354
whereabouts in the canal
did you throw it?

27:23.973 --> 27:26.155
I told you! <i>I</i> did it!

27:26.237 --> 27:30.030
Okay, so you got rid of the knife,
but not the bloodied shirt.

27:30.128 --> 27:32.928
- That's right.
- Now, before you go any further,

27:33.059 --> 27:36.918
I want you to think seriously
about what you're saying.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.800
I want you to think
about your family.

27:39.963 --> 27:41.152
I am.

27:41.656 --> 27:45.711
I'll sign your statement,
your confession, whatever it is.

27:45.987 --> 27:47.730
Just bring me a pen.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.224
Fountain or biro?

27:55.595 --> 27:57.321
I tell you what, boss.

27:57.403 --> 27:59.855
These tape machines
have come in dead handy.

28:07.761 --> 28:10.147
Get some cups, Raymondo,
and a couple of screwdrivers.

28:10.199 --> 28:11.846
Let's get this one cracked.

28:12.367 --> 28:13.357
<i>Cheers, guv!</i>

28:25.453 --> 28:27.641
Lytts, do me a favour.

28:27.818 --> 28:29.673
Run this shirt down to forensics.

28:29.746 --> 28:32.028
See if it's a match
for the victim's blood.

28:32.263 --> 28:33.549
Right, boss.

28:35.698 --> 28:36.887
Pity.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.241
All those fancy ways,
and you still can't admit...

28:40.323 --> 28:44.197
Evidence isn't conclusive.
The confession isn't sound.

28:44.303 --> 28:46.827
He was fuzzy about
the details of the killing

28:46.909 --> 28:49.123
and about what he did
with the murder weapon.

28:49.180 --> 28:53.983
And I don't believe his pysch profile
would fit that of a killer.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.074
So...

28:56.800 --> 28:58.721
The bet stands.

29:06.571 --> 29:08.509
I know that smell!

29:13.281 --> 29:16.196
What the hell are you playing at,
Litton? Dodds is ours!

29:16.342 --> 29:20.022
Stolen shotguns fall
under Crime's jurisprudence.

29:20.136 --> 29:22.530
That's a big word,
can you spell it?

29:24.959 --> 29:26.881
Why didn't you call me?

29:27.108 --> 29:29.828
DI Tyler's handling
this one personally.

29:29.990 --> 29:33.296
Alright then, Inspector.
Cat got your tongue?

29:39.737 --> 29:42.179
You know
the guns are fake, don't you?

29:42.310 --> 29:45.647
- Yeah, 'course you do.
- Sorry, what? Fake?

29:47.797 --> 29:50.955
Yeah.
They're wooden guns. Toys.

29:51.053 --> 29:52.567
Toys?!

29:53.219 --> 29:55.563
I agree that
departmental protocol suggests

29:55.628 --> 29:57.517
we hand the case over to RCS...

29:57.573 --> 29:59.608
in as much as the evidence
thus far obtained,

29:59.689 --> 30:02.115
however diluted from
its original perceived significance,

30:02.164 --> 30:04.134
would indeed benefit from...

30:04.216 --> 30:07.765
investment by a police body
more experienced and equipped

30:07.846 --> 30:10.174
to process it through to court.

30:12.747 --> 30:14.603
Yeah, I was gonna say that.

30:15.173 --> 30:17.664
You could have told me this sooner.

30:19.472 --> 30:21.507
Is that Blue Stratos?

30:22.305 --> 30:24.633
Paco Rabanne.

30:28.883 --> 30:31.358
That was better than the telly.

30:33.806 --> 30:39.603
The bet stands, until the bloods
are back, on Ted's shirt.

30:43.583 --> 30:46.612
And you, Dodds,
have got some talking to do.

30:46.685 --> 30:48.443
You said they were fakes.

31:03.856 --> 31:06.885
Access through the carpark.
Bogs are outside.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.351
Hey, I've got better things to do,
you know.

31:09.416 --> 31:13.128
So've I. You'd better not be
yanking our chain here, Dodds.

31:13.291 --> 31:14.968
The pick-up's
in the cafe toilets, yeah?

31:15.033 --> 31:17.524
Don't worry, Mr Tyler.
It was all arranged.

31:17.573 --> 31:20.927
It better have been,
or I'll hand you over to DCI Hunt,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.583
who will put you on remand for the first
unsolved crime he has on his books.

31:24.704 --> 31:27.847
Which in this case, happens to be
multiple buggery, with menaces.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.621
Now, you don't know
who the guns are for?

31:29.678 --> 31:32.153
I swear I don't.
All I do is drop-off.

31:32.234 --> 31:34.611
They're blag-slags.
No previous form.

31:35.662 --> 31:38.397
Okay. You drop the bag,
pick up the money.

31:38.478 --> 31:41.523
We'll move in when they pick up.
I'll tag you.

31:41.603 --> 31:43.215
Give me a police radio.

32:28.499 --> 32:29.672
Come on!

32:31.137 --> 32:32.455
Police!

32:41.897 --> 32:43.835
Is my name Coco?

32:44.616 --> 32:45.430
What?

32:45.496 --> 32:47.840
Why are you trying to
make me look like a clown?

32:47.930 --> 32:49.737
Litton's gonna have a field day
when he finds out

32:49.802 --> 32:51.837
you out let four untraceable
shooters out there.

32:51.934 --> 32:53.514
This isn't about Litton.

32:53.872 --> 32:56.135
And don't blame me for this.
You dumped it on me.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.678
You said you could multi...
storey, task, whatever.

33:00.727 --> 33:02.730
Can we just focus on
what's really important?

33:02.794 --> 33:05.546
- Yeah, the bet.
- No, Ted Bannister!

33:05.661 --> 33:09.422
We're still waiting for the blood
match results and time of death.

33:09.747 --> 33:11.669
What is your problem, Sam?

33:13.346 --> 33:16.537
My problem would rock your world.

33:16.635 --> 33:18.605
I'm not giving up on this one.
I'm gonna fight it.

33:18.703 --> 33:21.145
Ted Bannister is not our killer.

33:22.366 --> 33:24.841
I'll show you Ted Bannister.

33:28.651 --> 33:30.246
You hungry?

33:32.002 --> 33:35.730
Well, I told them not to feed you,
you murdering swine.

33:36.755 --> 33:41.852
Get in here and say that!
Get in here! Come on!

33:43.165 --> 33:46.503
You saw him. Is he guilty?

33:47.171 --> 33:49.207
He's locked up. He's scared.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.795
Snap decision.
Guilty. Yes or no?

33:52.105 --> 33:54.043
It doesn't work like that.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.072
Have you ever been somewhere,

33:57.365 --> 34:01.191
and you just know
it's about to kick off?

34:01.566 --> 34:03.389
That's primeval.

34:03.796 --> 34:06.369
When you first saw Bannister...

34:06.597 --> 34:10.635
I thought he was hiding something.
But I've talked to the man.

34:10.757 --> 34:14.176
Your clocks on it was wrong. That's why
you're a copper and not a train driver.

34:14.583 --> 34:18.002
Sometimes the job is this.

34:18.179 --> 34:22.396
And all your fancy science
and tape machines...

34:22.623 --> 34:24.268
useless without it.

34:25.652 --> 34:28.306
- I'm not giving up.
- Yeah?

34:29.054 --> 34:31.400
Well, if you want to
take me on and win,

34:31.465 --> 34:33.842
you're going to have
to do better than this.

34:33.980 --> 34:37.937
'Cause everything's pointing towards
Gene Genie getting his beer.

34:40.167 --> 34:43.782
These are all the informal statements
from the factory girls.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.768
Nice girls actually.

34:47.143 --> 34:49.309
Got any Satchawan chicken?

34:50.205 --> 34:52.371
I got a meal B.

34:54.553 --> 34:58.705
I love making tapes.
Lose all Saturday night doing that.

35:01.538 --> 35:05.771
Lose a whole statement if you rely
on this lot to write it down for you.

35:05.885 --> 35:07.693
At least you got a result.

35:09.346 --> 35:10.648
No.

35:12.635 --> 35:15.517
Your gut feeling
tells you otherwise?

35:15.826 --> 35:18.106
It's not a gut feeling, Annie.

35:20.568 --> 35:22.433
His confession was all wrong.

35:23.466 --> 35:25.300
When I mentioned "family",

35:25.498 --> 35:29.123
I saw the look of fear in his eyes,
and it was real fear.

35:29.874 --> 35:31.779
But not for himself.

35:36.371 --> 35:38.927
Here you go. Tina Reed.

35:39.009 --> 35:41.842
Derek Bannister's girl.
She's carrying his baby.

35:41.996 --> 35:45.937
She was shaking like a leaf today.
Broken nails...

35:46.417 --> 35:48.583
she was definitely scared.

35:50.471 --> 35:52.279
What if...

35:52.930 --> 35:56.854
Ted is confessing...

35:57.082 --> 35:59.052
to protect somebody?

35:59.785 --> 36:04.425
And what if Tina is scared...

36:04.963 --> 36:08.203
because she's covering up for somebody?

36:09.684 --> 36:12.745
Who have they both got in common?

36:13.054 --> 36:14.910
You're gonna nick Derek Bannister?

36:14.992 --> 36:17.450
No, I'm not gonna nick him.
I'm gonna bring him in.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.039
If Ted is covering for Derek,

36:20.104 --> 36:22.595
I reckon I can force the truth
out of both of them.

36:22.725 --> 36:26.226
Little psychology, Annie.
Right up your street.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.715
Go to Tina's house.
Bring her in.

36:31.862 --> 36:33.539
Don't tell her why.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.193
Paul, Sarah.

36:36.371 --> 36:38.911
Come on,
we'll finish this later.

36:45.141 --> 36:48.446
- I need your help.
- I don't see why.

36:48.609 --> 36:50.563
You've got me dad in prison
and me mum upset.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.476
You're doing fine on your own.

36:52.817 --> 36:54.657
Your dad's still at the station.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.676
He's terrified
the mill's never gonna open.

36:56.781 --> 37:00.429
If Crester's goes to the wall,
that'll be 800 blokes chasing 20 jobs.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.781
I just want the truth
to come out, Derek.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.239
The truth is, my dad believes
if we stick together like...

37:05.304 --> 37:07.811
some cotton army,
then the factory'll be saved.

37:08.584 --> 37:09.969
You seem smart, Derek.

37:10.066 --> 37:12.965
Yeah? Three O Levels.
Makes me a genius.

37:13.242 --> 37:15.668
I'm smart enough to know
when my kiddy comes along,

37:15.717 --> 37:18.534
there's no one on this earth I'd trust
to put food in his mouth but me.

37:18.615 --> 37:20.113
He'll have a future.

37:20.259 --> 37:22.587
And he won't be kidding
himself like me dad.

37:22.701 --> 37:26.234
- And he won't be afraid.
- What, like you're afraid?

37:34.525 --> 37:36.577
What's he doing here?

37:36.707 --> 37:39.312
- Go home, son.
- Why are you doing this to us, Dad?

37:39.377 --> 37:41.722
- Take him home!
- Everyone knows you didn't do it!

37:41.787 --> 37:43.936
- Yeah, well, I did.
- You know that's rubbish, Dad,

37:44.001 --> 37:46.525
- they'll throw away the key!
- Why'd you bring him here?

37:46.589 --> 37:50.171
Come on, Derek, talk to your dad.
Get if off your chest.

37:50.407 --> 37:53.126
- What's happening at Crester's?
- The coppers won't open it.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.503
But you've gotta do,
you've got your man!

37:56.920 --> 37:59.558
- Have we? Have we, Derek?
- What about the wages?

37:59.656 --> 38:01.691
That's a week's wages
for the whole of the factory!

38:01.772 --> 38:04.393
No one can get at 'em.
Dad, tell me what to do!

38:04.475 --> 38:05.631
There's nothing you can do.

38:05.745 --> 38:08.171
There's something you can both do.
Tell the truth.

38:08.236 --> 38:09.115
Dad?

38:10.618 --> 38:12.181
- I killed him.
- No!

38:12.263 --> 38:15.161
Yes! I had no choice!

38:17.543 --> 38:18.959
Oh, God.

38:19.154 --> 38:20.718
You know
why you're here, Tina.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.827
Look, if I'd'a known what I know now,
it'd be different, I swear.

38:23.909 --> 38:26.091
I've got a baby
to think of, haven't I?

38:26.172 --> 38:28.500
And you can't blame us,
because we had no choice.

38:28.565 --> 38:31.610
It's not even happening now.
It's not.

38:31.774 --> 38:34.037
- Can I smoke?
- Yes, you can smoke.

38:35.242 --> 38:36.821
<i>- Just tell me...</i>
- Forensics!

38:36.919 --> 38:39.622
Love it!
Always loved it!

38:39.768 --> 38:42.569
He's here as well now,
look, I was told nothing...

38:42.618 --> 38:44.295
We're in the middle
of something here, guv.

38:44.360 --> 38:48.382
The blood match from Ted's shirt.
It's Saunders'. Every little drop.

38:49.798 --> 38:51.573
You're joking.

38:51.687 --> 38:54.846
...the back, to pick up the bag,
I've always been thin like Twiggy,

38:54.944 --> 38:57.370
well, not exactly
as thin as Twiggy...

38:57.484 --> 39:00.121
No one can touch
the Gene Genie.

39:00.235 --> 39:03.394
That's all I know, that's where
it ends, end of story.

39:03.508 --> 39:06.260
Get her out of here, Cartwright,
she's using up my oxygen.

39:06.325 --> 39:08.246
- Tina, love...
- End of story.

39:08.377 --> 39:12.024
Yeah. End of story.
I'm taking you home.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.313
What, that's it? I can go?

39:15.378 --> 39:16.778
He said you can go.

39:17.071 --> 39:20.507
- I'm not in trouble?
- No, you're not in trouble.

39:50.144 --> 39:53.108
You got some lonely shape,
my brudder.

39:53.368 --> 39:54.671
Why so?

39:56.788 --> 39:58.514
It's over, Nelson.

40:00.305 --> 40:03.887
I'm fighting to stay strong,
but I feel like I'm losing.

40:04.091 --> 40:06.338
You're strong. No doubt.

40:06.549 --> 40:08.878
But you got to pick your fights,
mon brave.

40:08.942 --> 40:11.955
Who you fighting? Mr Hunt?

40:13.094 --> 40:14.869
He really your enemy?

40:16.693 --> 40:18.533
I don't know.

40:18.798 --> 40:20.964
You're fighting cos you're scared.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.325
Maybe fear is enemy.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.883
It's not over for you, Sam.

40:51.068 --> 40:53.396
- What do you want?
- I told you.

40:53.461 --> 40:56.604
I'm your only friend.
I'm here to help.

40:57.320 --> 40:58.899
Do you feel helpless?

41:01.228 --> 41:04.028
- Yeah.
- Unappreciated?

41:05.103 --> 41:08.555
- That's a big word for a little girl.
- Scared?

41:11.209 --> 41:12.837
Scared...

41:15.165 --> 41:17.363
I'll stop fighting.

41:20.359 --> 41:25.276
If I stop fighting,
then I'm scared I'll die.

41:25.422 --> 41:27.018
You poor thing.

41:29.004 --> 41:31.870
- What can I do?
- Give up.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.465
Lie down.

41:34.084 --> 41:37.894
Close your eyes. And sleep.

41:38.708 --> 41:42.812
And sleep.
No more nastiness.

41:42.925 --> 41:44.277
Just sleep.

41:44.895 --> 41:47.778
Just sleep. Forever.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.211
Sleep.

41:52.939 --> 41:53.981
No!

42:16.023 --> 42:20.338
Time of death.
Tea, one sugar. Bourbons.

42:20.485 --> 42:23.595
See? Multitasking.

42:25.451 --> 42:27.878
- Hand it over.
- Here you go.

42:27.992 --> 42:30.190
The report, Chris.

42:55.722 --> 42:56.911
Shit!

43:01.551 --> 43:03.895
Ted Bannister left the pub
at ten to eleven.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.491
Derek left at ten.

43:05.605 --> 43:09.480
Saunders was murdered
before nine.

43:09.675 --> 43:10.855
Which means...

43:10.938 --> 43:14.744
both Ted and Derek were still
in the pub drinking when it happened.

43:18.041 --> 43:19.962
Who the hell killed him, then?

43:20.060 --> 43:22.958
Look, we know you didn't do it!

43:24.147 --> 43:27.240
I've told you, you've got it wrong,
I've signed a confession!

43:27.289 --> 43:30.969
Well, we're all at sea here,
because this is making zero sense!

43:31.018 --> 43:32.792
Now, you'd better start
helping us out!

43:32.906 --> 43:35.153
Start talking,
cos I'm thirsty.

43:35.235 --> 43:38.149
Yeah, well,
I've told you! <i>I</i> did it!

43:39.756 --> 43:41.401
What are we looking for?

43:41.482 --> 43:44.136
The bloods on that shirt
carried oil traces.

43:44.380 --> 43:46.090
Well, it's a work shirt.

43:46.530 --> 43:49.053
You didn't read
the forensic report, you, did you?

43:49.200 --> 43:51.870
There was oil in Saunders' wounds.

43:51.984 --> 43:54.541
There's oil everywhere, it's a factory.

43:54.752 --> 43:57.927
Hang on, this is the loom
he was using when he died.

43:58.106 --> 44:01.574
- No, this oil is a red herring.
- Hang on, I've got a feeling.

44:01.671 --> 44:05.009
Oh, so it's alright for you
to have feelings, is it, Gladys?

44:05.058 --> 44:07.109
- What's wrong with this machine?
- I dunno.

44:07.272 --> 44:10.952
It's the wrong colour.
It's giving you a shifty look.

44:17.703 --> 44:22.376
Mr Coynes...there's no dirt,
or oil, on this belt.

44:22.457 --> 44:26.300
It's a brand new belt. It's not dirty
because it hasn't been used as yet.

44:28.945 --> 44:30.867
But it was being used.

44:30.981 --> 44:33.586
By Saunders,
the night he died.

44:33.667 --> 44:38.177
So, that means somebody has
replaced the belt, after his death.

44:40.986 --> 44:43.917
- Bloody hell.
- Yeah, well, you lost me.

44:43.998 --> 44:46.033
Why would somebody
replace this belt?

44:46.131 --> 44:47.499
They can snap.

44:47.629 --> 44:49.599
And what happens
when they snap?

44:52.631 --> 44:55.253
Jimmy Saunders wasn't murdered.

44:55.350 --> 44:58.932
This belt drives
the drums behind me.

44:59.877 --> 45:02.645
Two inch wide leather,
at tension,

45:02.742 --> 45:06.227
running at high speed,
and bound with staples.

45:06.299 --> 45:10.093
Now, these belts,
they can wear down. Shear.

45:10.582 --> 45:12.389
The belt snapped

45:13.382 --> 45:16.948
Flew out the loom, like a whip,
straight at Saunders.

45:17.013 --> 45:18.934
Chris, can you step up please?

45:19.032 --> 45:21.979
Now, he saw it coming.
Nothing he could do about it.

45:22.076 --> 45:23.737
The wounds...

45:25.196 --> 45:30.390
...were here, here and here.

45:30.618 --> 45:32.523
Four separate wounds, right?

45:32.637 --> 45:35.039
Chris, put your arms up,
try to defend yourself.

45:35.706 --> 45:37.481
Without the Boris Karloffs.

45:37.848 --> 45:42.049
See, if you line the wounds up,
they form a single straight line,

45:42.122 --> 45:45.232
right across the body,
and around the shoulder.

45:45.378 --> 45:47.071
Hang about, Sherlock.

45:47.348 --> 45:50.165
We've got an ID of Ted
leaving the scene.

45:51.630 --> 45:55.066
So you went to the factory
to have it out with him.

45:55.147 --> 45:57.134
To finish what you'd started.

45:57.654 --> 45:59.104
He was dead.

45:59.739 --> 46:02.718
- I panicked.
- You tried to clean up.

46:02.864 --> 46:05.710
You replaced the drive belt
with a new one from stores.

46:05.793 --> 46:07.112
Why do that?

46:08.349 --> 46:11.280
If it got out,
it'd be a death knell for the factory.

46:11.418 --> 46:13.567
Dodgy floor joist
can close a mill.

46:13.714 --> 46:15.896
What's a fatal accident
going to do to us?

46:15.985 --> 46:18.314
It took you a long time
to clear up, though, didn't it?

46:18.444 --> 46:20.528
Half two by the time you left.

46:20.691 --> 46:23.752
You were spotted by Martin Ellis,
truck driver.

46:24.737 --> 46:27.830
You'd do that, just so
they could keep their jobs.

46:27.952 --> 46:31.111
Just for the chance
they could keep their jobs.

46:31.412 --> 46:32.649
Sorry.

46:33.984 --> 46:35.173
Why?

46:35.580 --> 46:38.234
Right, get out of my station,
get out of my sight.

46:38.283 --> 46:41.035
I should bang you up
for just wasting my time.

46:41.344 --> 46:45.057
It doesn't matter.
Only my family matters.

46:57.895 --> 46:59.605
It's good though.

47:00.163 --> 47:02.312
Nobody goes down for life.

47:04.429 --> 47:06.595
Community goes down for life.

47:06.757 --> 47:08.516
You don't know that for sure.

47:10.535 --> 47:13.010
We were going for that drink.

47:15.078 --> 47:16.266
Sorry.

47:16.804 --> 47:18.660
Got to finish the report.

47:20.907 --> 47:22.909
<i>But that's when
they asked us to do it.</i>

47:22.974 --> 47:26.052
<i>That's where it ends,
that's all I know, end of story.</i>

47:29.959 --> 47:31.099
Ray.

47:33.704 --> 47:36.032
<i>I was told nothing.</i>

47:36.114 --> 47:38.328
<i>Go through the back,
pick up the bag.</i>

47:38.425 --> 47:41.714
<i>I've always been thin like Twiggy,
well, not exactly as thin as Twiggy...</i>

47:41.780 --> 47:43.652
She didn't half go on, that one.

47:45.365 --> 47:46.863
Hang on a minute.

47:48.181 --> 47:50.184
<i>I was told nothing.</i>

47:50.347 --> 47:54.401
<i>Go through the back, pick up
the bag. I've always been thin...</i>

47:55.459 --> 47:58.259
"Go through the back
and pick up the bag".

47:58.618 --> 48:00.116
Meaning?

48:02.770 --> 48:04.186
Outside toilet.

48:05.244 --> 48:07.231
I picked up the guns.

48:07.328 --> 48:10.015
But Derek wasn't gonna use 'em.

48:10.161 --> 48:12.408
Not even with no one at the mill.

48:12.522 --> 48:15.046
Ted says you've gotta fight.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.463
Does he know?

48:17.114 --> 48:20.484
Ted? 'Course not.

48:22.030 --> 48:23.724
It's a wages job.

48:23.821 --> 48:26.523
Alright, love.
We're picking up your boyfriend,

48:26.581 --> 48:29.585
and I need the addresses
of the other blokes involved.

48:35.868 --> 48:37.790
They're not there.

48:38.115 --> 48:40.769
The factory's gonna
open tomorrow, innit?

48:41.355 --> 48:43.260
They're doing the job tonight.

48:44.980 --> 48:46.771
Right. Dirty Harry.

48:50.923 --> 48:53.658
We should call
Litton and the RCS.

48:53.740 --> 48:57.680
Okay. Then we can call the Mayor
and he can give 'em another award.

48:57.778 --> 49:00.790
Look, I haven't done
target range for a while.

49:00.872 --> 49:04.893
It's okay. Blokes are a lot easier
to hit than paper targets.

49:05.235 --> 49:06.912
You want it or not?

49:08.087 --> 49:10.464
Probably end up
turning it on us.

49:16.048 --> 49:18.881
Yeah, but can you hit anything?

49:19.272 --> 49:22.301
You should see
my Playstation scores.

49:37.254 --> 49:40.967
Drop your weapons!
You are surrounded by armed bastards!

49:41.064 --> 49:42.383
Up yours!

50:00.953 --> 50:02.353
Put it down!

50:03.461 --> 50:05.846
Police! Stay where you are,
where I can see you!

50:05.927 --> 50:07.751
Drop it, laughing boy!

50:08.581 --> 50:10.356
Get away!

50:14.132 --> 50:16.574
- Drop it.
- Shoot!

50:16.721 --> 50:20.042
You know you want to,
so drop it.

50:33.286 --> 50:34.784
I'm on him!

51:03.718 --> 51:05.151
Derek.

51:06.291 --> 51:07.902
Think about it.

51:10.182 --> 51:13.340
- Put the gun on the floor.
- I can't do that.

51:13.731 --> 51:15.685
Yes you can.

51:16.304 --> 51:18.241
You've got a baby
on the way, mate.

51:18.339 --> 51:20.211
That's why I'm doing it.

51:20.293 --> 51:22.523
I'm the only one who can,
you know that.

51:23.777 --> 51:25.324
It's a war.

51:26.382 --> 51:28.157
Now, drop the gun.

51:34.670 --> 51:36.038
Put it down.

51:37.438 --> 51:39.262
Last warning.

51:40.374 --> 51:42.670
You can't hit me
'fore I hit him.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.568
For God's sake,
don't throw him down a wager.

51:58.069 --> 51:59.519
Your turn.

51:59.665 --> 52:02.726
"I'm sorry I'm scum."
Say it.

52:03.084 --> 52:04.534
Sorry, son.

52:04.745 --> 52:07.627
- Doesn't work that way.
- Say it!

52:07.888 --> 52:09.223
Come on, Derek.

52:09.435 --> 52:12.285
Is this really the best life plan
you could come up with?

52:12.366 --> 52:14.613
- Stealing from your own?
- Or what?

52:14.711 --> 52:17.186
Meant to stand shoulder
to shoulder with them?

52:17.340 --> 52:21.330
Your dad was willing
to give up everything

52:21.525 --> 52:23.788
to stop this place from closing.

52:23.935 --> 52:28.331
He didn't want to kill anybody.
He wanted to save everyone.

52:28.681 --> 52:30.830
Look, I know
how you're feeling.

52:30.944 --> 52:33.207
You feel like the walls
are closing in on you

52:33.256 --> 52:37.131
and you're trapped and terrified
of what's waiting for you out there.

52:37.213 --> 52:40.547
You see, Derek? You think you got
problems, I have to work with him!

52:41.015 --> 52:42.542
- Shut up!
- Derek.

52:42.643 --> 52:44.414
It's not fair!

52:45.147 --> 52:46.694
Now listen to me.

52:46.897 --> 52:51.131
You're looking at...
first offence - five years.

52:51.936 --> 52:55.518
Now... I'm gonna
pick up my gun,

52:55.730 --> 52:58.547
and I want you to put yours down.
- Uh, Sam, no.

52:58.612 --> 52:59.915
Alright, Derek?

53:15.692 --> 53:18.444
Chris, Ray, ambulance,
now, quick!

53:22.384 --> 53:23.654
You okay?

53:25.388 --> 53:27.260
See, I told you.

53:28.025 --> 53:29.768
I'll do you a deal.

53:30.793 --> 53:33.822
I'll listen to your little tape machine,
now and again,

53:33.976 --> 53:38.926
okay, so long as you,
just sometimes, listen to this.

53:39.056 --> 53:40.001
'kay?

54:10.157 --> 54:12.517
He was quite badly injured.

54:13.136 --> 54:17.061
And, Ted...
he's under arrest.

54:32.158 --> 54:33.770
You alright, son?

54:35.610 --> 54:39.517
Dad. I was scared.

54:41.211 --> 54:43.247
I couldn't see a future for us.

54:43.328 --> 54:45.721
But you could've come to me.

54:46.454 --> 54:48.310
It was down to me.

54:49.499 --> 54:51.355
I had to fight.

54:51.452 --> 54:53.455
Oh, you stupid boy.

54:53.683 --> 54:57.395
I mean, you've got your workmates,
your mam and dad, your family.

55:02.527 --> 55:05.115
You're not on your own.
Nobody is.

55:05.327 --> 55:07.411
Not unless you want to be.

55:11.450 --> 55:13.518
He's right, what he said.

55:14.462 --> 55:15.977
It is a war.

55:16.676 --> 55:19.216
At least I know
what I'm fighting for.

55:30.064 --> 55:31.970
You want a drink, Litton?

55:32.035 --> 55:33.809
'Fraid we haven't got
any Babycham.

55:33.892 --> 55:36.399
You knew those shooters
were the real deal.

55:36.505 --> 55:39.549
Bloody hell,
you really are a detective.

55:41.894 --> 55:43.343
That's very good.

55:44.092 --> 55:46.697
Now, when are you gonna get it
into your thick skulls

55:46.779 --> 55:49.026
that armed blags are mine?

55:49.204 --> 55:51.761
Do you mind? I nearly had
my brains blown out tonight!

55:51.858 --> 55:53.731
Would you have noticed?

55:53.845 --> 55:57.150
If you were going for heavy blood loss,
Gene, should have shot you in the gut.

55:58.029 --> 56:00.585
Hey. Mr Litton,

56:00.732 --> 56:04.673
I think you'd better
swallow it down. We had a result.

56:05.161 --> 56:06.610
One nil.

56:39.553 --> 56:42.288
Right, the chosen vintage of the CID.

56:46.929 --> 56:50.429
What are you thinking,
dare she ask?

56:50.608 --> 56:52.301
I've been thinking...

56:53.604 --> 56:55.655
about what's important.

56:56.079 --> 56:58.016
Oi, Romeo.

56:58.309 --> 57:00.344
We gonna open
this bogwater or what?

57:00.409 --> 57:01.891
You open it.

57:02.184 --> 57:05.066
No, I can't. It needs two.

57:09.056 --> 57:11.873
- Eh up, here we go.
- Go on then.
