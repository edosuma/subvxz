- No.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.813

28:35.881 --> 28:36.947
- No, you're gonna let me

28:39.185 --> 28:40.451

finish a sentence?

29:35.708 --> 29:37.274
- Do you understand?
- Okay, no, no, no. I--

29:37.343 --> 29:39.843
- I understand why Nany's
pissed off and upset.

29:39.912 --> 29:43.447
It's also a combination of
thinking someone's your friend

29:43.516 --> 29:46.250
and then realizing this person
hasn't been your friend

29:46.318 --> 29:48.285
