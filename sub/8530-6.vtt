WEBVTT

00:03.125 --> 00:04.959
We have to find a way
to defeat The Annihilator.

00:05.041 --> 00:06.792
There's got to be something
in these comics

00:06.875 --> 00:07.834
about his weaknesses.

00:07.917 --> 00:09.959
Ha!
I found it.

00:10.041 --> 00:10.959
What is it?

00:11.041 --> 00:13.500
My third grade
math homework.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.792
Addition. Like I'm ever gonna
use that in real life.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.125
Kaz, focus, okay?

00:21.208 --> 00:23.041
Skylar is trying
to destroy me.

00:23.125 --> 00:24.959
I have to constantly
look over my shoulder

00:25.041 --> 00:27.542
knowing she could be right
behind me, ready to strike.

00:27.625 --> 00:28.625
Like right now?

00:28.709 --> 00:30.709
(screams)

00:33.625 --> 00:35.542
You scream like a girl.

00:35.625 --> 00:39.208
Yes. And I'd like to live long
enough to scream like a woman.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.041
Wait.
Remember this?

00:45.125 --> 00:47.208
Annihilator,
the origin of evil.

00:47.291 --> 00:48.792
We read it
like 10 years ago.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.917
The Annihilator
was born on earth

00:52.000 --> 00:54.917
and started exhibiting
his mutant powers as a child.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.917
Everyone teased and tormented
him for being a freak,

00:57.000 --> 00:58.208
so he withdrew
from society.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.583
But he didn't
become truly powerful

01:01.667 --> 01:03.250
until he was discovered
and trained

01:03.333 --> 01:04.917
by the legendary
Hapax the Elder,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.709
a human with similar mutation
who wanted to groom him

01:07.792 --> 01:09.208
to be a great superhero.

01:09.291 --> 01:12.000
But The Annihilator decided
to use his powers for evil,

01:12.083 --> 01:14.000
to make everyone suffer
the way he suffered.

01:14.083 --> 01:14.959
(gasps)

01:15.041 --> 01:18.041
My third grade
science homework.

01:18.125 --> 01:19.917
That's where I put it.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.917
Anyway, Hapax the Elder
was so upset

01:25.000 --> 01:27.834
about being betrayed that
he went into self imposed exile

01:27.917 --> 01:29.458
on Skylar's
home planet Caldera.

01:29.542 --> 01:33.250
So we need to somehow
get to Caldera and find Hapax.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.375
He is the only one who can
drain the Annihilator's powers

01:35.458 --> 01:37.041
which will turn Skylar

01:37.125 --> 01:38.834
and all the other
evil superheroes good again.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.417
Only one problem.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.083
Nobody knows
what Hapax the Elder looks like

01:43.166 --> 01:45.166
and he's on another planet.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.041
And he's like 90 years old now,
so we don't even know

01:48.125 --> 01:48.959
if he's still alive.

01:49.041 --> 01:50.709
Those are three problems.

01:52.458 --> 01:55.625
So I guess you do use
addition in real life.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.417
So I figured out
how to get to Caldera.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.083
We take the I-95,
get off at exit 17,

02:51.166 --> 02:52.917
go straight for about
81 billion light-years

02:53.000 --> 02:54.041
and we're there.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.375
That's crazy.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.375
We can't take the I-95.

02:58.458 --> 02:59.875
It's under construction.
Ah...

03:01.625 --> 03:04.083
Wait, we can use
the wormhole transporter.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.917
Where does Horace keep it?
I don't know.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.625
And we can't tell Horace
about Skylar being evil

03:09.709 --> 03:11.166
because then
he'll be in danger, too.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.041
Oh, hey, uh, Horace.

03:14.125 --> 03:18.208
Kaz and I have a lot of
vacation days stored up,

03:18.291 --> 03:20.959
so we were hoping
to take a road trip...

03:21.041 --> 03:22.333
to the planet Caldera.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.667
So can we borrow
the wormhole transporter?

03:26.750 --> 03:28.125
Absolutely not.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.583
The wormhole transporter
is not a toy.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.125
This is a toy.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.375
All right, Horace.

03:37.458 --> 03:40.834
We'll put gas in the wormhole
transporter when we're done,

03:40.917 --> 03:43.709
if it takes gas,
I don't know how it works.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.166
I said no,

03:46.250 --> 03:49.166
so do not touch
the wormhole transporter!

03:49.250 --> 03:51.917
Don't even open that drawer
where I keep it!

03:52.000 --> 03:54.959
Besides, you two
couldn't survive on Caldera

03:55.041 --> 03:57.625
without atmosphere
regulator patches,

03:57.709 --> 03:59.333
which I also
forbid you to use.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.208
Put on
the regulator patch.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.500
Yep.

04:04.583 --> 04:05.625
All right.

04:05.709 --> 04:08.875
Ha-ha-ha,
it's so cold.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.792
I just need to adjust
the controls.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.750
Wait, are you sure
you want to use that thing?

04:13.834 --> 04:15.750
Because I'm just saying,
if we drove,

04:15.834 --> 04:17.208
we could play I-Spy.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.125
Ready?
Yep.

04:25.959 --> 04:27.667
I can't believe it.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.834
We're on Caldera,
the volcanic planet.

04:29.917 --> 04:32.959
I spy with my little eye,

04:33.041 --> 04:35.542
something that starts
with a V.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.125
A volcano?

04:38.333 --> 04:40.417
Oh, you are good
at this game.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.667
Uncle Horace,

04:47.750 --> 04:49.667
I had a great day
at school today.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.333
You know, the more time
I spend with normos,

04:51.417 --> 04:54.083
the more I realize they're
better than superheroes,

04:54.166 --> 04:56.166
who are weak
and pathetic.

04:59.542 --> 05:00.875
See?

05:00.959 --> 05:03.041
(cell phone ringing)

05:03.125 --> 05:03.959
Excuse me.

05:05.291 --> 05:06.208
Hello?

05:06.291 --> 05:08.083
Horace, it's Optimo.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.625
I have a medical emergency

05:09.709 --> 05:11.417
and I have to come
to Mighty Med right away.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.959
You can't.
Alan's here.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.709
He can't find out you're
his father, it's too risky.

05:16.792 --> 05:18.625
Well, so is not
getting this treated.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.375
I'll be there in 1 minute.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.834
Oh, I'm gonna lose you,
I'm going through a tunnel.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.750
Anyway,
normos are amazing.

05:29.834 --> 05:33.041
With no powers at all, they do
dangerous things all the time,

05:33.125 --> 05:35.917
like get lunch
from a food truck.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.792
You're right.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.709
You should get far away
from these superhero losers

05:39.792 --> 05:40.959
as fast as you can.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.375
They're all weak
and pathetic.

05:42.458 --> 05:44.000
(groans)

05:45.625 --> 05:47.834
You disgust me!

05:47.917 --> 05:49.542
W-wait, uh, actually,

05:49.625 --> 05:51.166
there's this popular
normo event

05:51.250 --> 05:53.375
I've been wanting to go to
called a swap meet, I...

05:53.458 --> 05:56.166
All right, don't tell me
about it, just go!

05:56.250 --> 05:58.166
It's not because I'm trying
to hide anything from you,

05:58.250 --> 06:00.709
it's just because I'm not
interested in your life!

06:03.083 --> 06:05.417
Hey, maybe that person
over there will know

06:05.500 --> 06:07.667
where we can find
Hapax the Elder.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.000
Excuse me.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.166
We are...

06:10.250 --> 06:11.250
(high-pitched scream)

06:12.542 --> 06:15.125
I mean...
(low-pitched scream)

06:17.083 --> 06:18.750
Oh, I forgot.

06:18.834 --> 06:20.458
All Calderans are grown in genetic pods,

06:20.542 --> 06:22.000
so they're identical.

06:22.083 --> 06:24.041
Every girl looks
just like Skylar.

06:25.542 --> 06:28.417
A planet full of Skylars
is like my dream come true.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.709
But I'm afraid of Skylar now,

06:29.792 --> 06:31.291
so that's also my worst nightmare.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.917
I'm so torn.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.000
Is it always
so hot here?

06:36.083 --> 06:39.083
Hot? It's only
3,000 degrees.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.417
This is the coldest winter
we've had in years.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.000
Winter?

06:45.083 --> 06:47.333
Oh, well, that would
explain the lava man.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.041
Gus?
Who's Gus?

06:58.125 --> 07:00.583
And that's the most ridiculous
name I've ever heard.

07:00.667 --> 07:04.250
My name is Kakai-rata-heeha-
mwa-floopy-pa-zoing.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.959
Wait. Skylar once showed me
a picture of her pet dorenbosch

07:09.041 --> 07:11.458
and he looked a lot like Gus.
This must be him.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.583
Okay,
first off, I'm a her.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.709
And did you say Skylar
as in Skylar Storm?

07:17.792 --> 07:19.208
Yeah,
we know her from Earth.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.250
I haven't seen
Skylar in a year.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.542
I've got
no attention at all.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.041
Can a sister
get a belly rub?

07:26.542 --> 07:27.542
Maybe later.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.792
Anyway, we're here because
Skylar needs our help.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.542
Do you have any idea where
we could find Hapax the Elder?

07:34.625 --> 07:37.166
He's very reclusive,

07:37.250 --> 07:39.125
but I think
I can find him for you.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.709
Follow me.

07:40.792 --> 07:41.959
So you're friends
with Skylar?

07:42.041 --> 07:43.583
Oh,
he's her friend.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.875
She and I uh...
it's complicated.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.417
It's not complicated,
they're just friends.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.959
Optimo,
what's the emergency?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.917
Did you swallow
a tiny nuclear reactor?

07:57.000 --> 07:58.500
I've been seeing
a lot of that lately.

07:58.583 --> 08:02.291
No, I have a small rash
on my hand.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.166
That rash?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.834
That's why
you came here?

08:05.917 --> 08:09.417
Fine, I came because
I wanted to see my son.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.875
And I heard
your gift shop

08:10.959 --> 08:12.667
is having a sale
on reading glasses.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.542
That's true.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.208
But it's
beside the point.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.959
Look,
you can't be here.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.083
Think of what your archenemy
Razor Claw will do to Alan

08:23.166 --> 08:24.291
if he finds out
he's your son.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.542
I know,
but I miss him.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.583
Alan, not Razor Claw.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.500
Razor Claw
is a complete tool.

08:32.208 --> 08:35.834
Look, Alan's safety
is the most important thing.

08:35.917 --> 08:38.333
Now I'm gonna run some
routine tests on your rash.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.875
But you must leave
before he gets here.

08:43.959 --> 08:45.417
(groans)

08:47.083 --> 08:49.875
Alan, I'm surprised
to see you.

08:49.959 --> 08:51.792
Back from the swap meet
so soon?

08:51.875 --> 08:55.667
Well, no one wanted
to swap meat with me.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.166
Well, there's no need
to stay around

08:58.250 --> 09:00.417
these
pathetic superheroes.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.000
Like that guy with a face
squid stuck to his face.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.333
What a tool!

09:08.500 --> 09:09.500
(gasps)

09:09.583 --> 09:11.750
That was a close call.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.125
I'll say.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.333
That thing almost
laid eggs in my mouth.

09:21.542 --> 09:25.250
Man, I hope Hapax the Elder
isn't like my grandpa.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.291
Dead?

09:26.375 --> 09:29.041
No,
the other grandpa.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.041
A stamp collector?

09:31.125 --> 09:34.083
Yes, that's my big fear
in this dark and scary cave

09:34.166 --> 09:36.291
that Hapax has
a somewhat boring hobby.

09:37.625 --> 09:40.291
(man) (in evil voice)
Who goes there?

09:40.375 --> 09:42.959
Uh, we're looking
for Hapax the Elder.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.041
You found him.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.083
What are you staring at?

09:51.166 --> 09:54.792
You just look so much
like this guy we know.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.000
Your last name
isn't Diaz, is it?

09:58.083 --> 10:00.583
No.
(scoffs) Diaz.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.875
It's Gonzalez.

10:02.959 --> 10:04.750
Hapax the Elder Gonzalez.

10:06.375 --> 10:09.000
But I don't get it,
you're not old.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.458
O-Okay, let me guess,
on Caldera,

10:11.542 --> 10:13.458
Elder means teenager?

10:13.542 --> 10:15.458
No, our word
for teenager is

10:15.542 --> 10:17.792
"I hate you,
you're ruining my life!"

10:19.709 --> 10:23.458
They call me Hapax the Elder
because I'm 93 years old.

10:23.542 --> 10:27.291
My mutation has caused me
to age in reverse.

10:27.375 --> 10:30.417
It's also caused me
to crave human blood.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.542
I'm just kidding.

10:38.792 --> 10:42.208
Um, sure, I guess
I'll go get that.

10:44.041 --> 10:46.417
Hapax, we came here because
we need your help

10:46.500 --> 10:48.709
to save our friend
Skylar Storm.

10:48.792 --> 10:51.917
Skylar was turned evil
by The Annihilator.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Can you help us
defeat him?

10:54.208 --> 10:55.959
I...I don't think so.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.709
I'm way too old
for the superhero game.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.625
Besides, I don't think
I'm powerful enough anymore

11:01.709 --> 11:02.750
to defeat Neil.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.083
Neil?

11:04.166 --> 11:07.250
Sorry. (mocking)
The Annihilator!

11:08.834 --> 11:10.792
When I knew him,
he was Neil Gunzenhauser

11:10.875 --> 11:11.959
but that was years ago,

11:12.041 --> 11:13.583
back when we both
lived on Earth.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.041
Here you go.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.375
Why would you do that?

11:20.458 --> 11:22.500
I just brought it back.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.875
Hapax, please.

11:26.959 --> 11:29.417
You're our only hope
to save Skylar and the Earth.

11:30.458 --> 11:31.792
(sighs)

11:31.875 --> 11:34.500
Okay, I'll help
under one condition.

11:34.583 --> 11:35.875
You need to bring me
something.

11:35.959 --> 11:38.000
(sniffs)
Some cave freshener?

11:39.417 --> 11:41.542
The box of Azimeth.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.834
It lies at the top
of Caldera's tallest volcano

11:44.917 --> 11:47.041
and it's guarded
by a man-eating monster

11:47.125 --> 11:48.625
known as the Dracaina!

11:50.291 --> 11:53.125
Fortunately, the Dracaina
hibernates during the winter

11:53.208 --> 11:55.000
so the only thing that
would be able to wake it up

11:55.083 --> 11:57.917
would be if the long dormant
volcano suddenly erupted.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.792
(rumbling)

12:00.875 --> 12:02.375
Like that?

12:02.458 --> 12:03.917
No, that was my stomach.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.208
I skipped breakfast.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.667
(explosion)

12:08.750 --> 12:11.125
That was the volcano.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.375
Dude, seriously?

12:18.458 --> 12:19.917
You get it this time.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.500
-(Kaz) Are we there yet?
-(Oliver) Stop it.

12:34.583 --> 12:35.875
-(Kaz) Are we there yet?
-Stop it.

12:35.959 --> 12:36.917
Are we there yet?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.875
Yes, we're there.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.250
Oh, okay.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.000
(explosion)

12:45.041 --> 12:45.959
Can we go now?

12:46.041 --> 12:46.959
Stop it.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.500
Go now?
Stop it.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.959
Excuse me, ma'am.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.333
We're looking
for a man-eating beast

12:55.417 --> 12:57.959
who protects
the box of Azimeth.

12:58.041 --> 12:59.083
Do you know where it is?

13:02.166 --> 13:03.291
She probably
didn't hear you.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.083
She's very old.

13:05.166 --> 13:06.542
Or young.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.834
I don't know anymore,
I'm so confused.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.208
Excuse me!

13:16.083 --> 13:20.250
Do you know
where the box of Azimeth is?

13:20.333 --> 13:24.166
Why, it's right over there.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.333
And I have a name.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.750
It's Dracaina.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.709
(whimpering)

13:32.792 --> 13:36.709
Don't worry, Kakai-rata-heeha-
mwa-floopy-pa-zoing.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.375
We'll be okay.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.166
Yeah, I mean, how hard
is it gonna be to get past

13:41.250 --> 13:42.709
the little old lady?

13:42.792 --> 13:44.875
(roars)

13:49.542 --> 13:51.000
(screams)

13:53.667 --> 13:56.625
Why is nothing
on this planet as it seems?

13:59.333 --> 14:03.083
-So, we got the results back on your rash.
-And?

14:03.166 --> 14:04.959
Before we
talk about that,

14:05.041 --> 14:06.917
how about we make
some idle chitchat?

14:08.041 --> 14:10.458
So...you're gonna die.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.500
What?

14:13.583 --> 14:15.834
It turns out you have a deadly
virus that's gonna eat away

14:15.917 --> 14:18.000
at your body until
you're a giant puddle of goo.

14:18.083 --> 14:21.750
And not the fun
kind of goo. Icky goo.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.041
That's terrible.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.417
Luckily, I can cure you
if I can get a sample

14:25.500 --> 14:27.083
of super erythrocytes

14:27.166 --> 14:29.166
from your only living
blood relative. Alan.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.875
Oh, that's great.
Let's go find him.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.333
Hold on.
One slight hiccup.

14:32.417 --> 14:36.792
(hiccups)
That's better.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.458
The problem is, I can't tell
Alan the sample's for you.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.542
And I'm pretty sure he won't
help any other patients here,

14:42.625 --> 14:44.583
given that earlier
he pushed a superhero

14:44.667 --> 14:46.959
on crutches down
an elevator shaft.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.083
Look, can't we appeal
to his sense of kindness

14:49.166 --> 14:50.166
and generosity?

14:53.583 --> 14:56.291
Oh, you don't know Alan
very well, do you?

14:56.375 --> 14:57.709
(drilling noise)

14:57.792 --> 14:59.417
I think
I hear Alan coming.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.875
Go!
(groans)

15:03.959 --> 15:05.291
Oh, good news.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.625
It wasn't Alan.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.000
It was just
an annoying grating,

15:08.083 --> 15:10.208
drilling noise that sounds
exactly like Alan.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.333
You'll never get the box

15:17.417 --> 15:19.709
of Azimeth
while I'm alive.

15:19.792 --> 15:23.041
I've spent my entire life
guarding it.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.458
Well, hey, you know,

15:24.542 --> 15:26.417
maybe it's time
for a career change.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.625
Have you ever considered
the job of handing over

15:30.709 --> 15:32.125
the box of Azimeth?

15:35.959 --> 15:37.375
We need that box now!

15:37.458 --> 15:39.250
Hapax gave us those arrows.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.250
So let's hit her
with everything we've got.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.667
I'm on it!

15:48.917 --> 15:50.750
You know, as soon
as it left my hand,

15:50.834 --> 15:53.041
I kind of knew
I made a mistake.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.667
We're totally
out of ammunition.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.458
Now what?

15:57.542 --> 15:59.125
(screams)

16:02.208 --> 16:04.000
Watch out for the lava!

16:04.083 --> 16:05.417
And the falling rocks.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.041
Wow, I hate this planet.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.375
The falling rocks!

16:09.458 --> 16:11.917
If we caused a rockslide
over by the Dracaina,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.291
it might knock her
into the lava pit.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.375
Yeah, and we could use
this bow as a slingshot.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.291
-Yeah.
-Kaz, you and I will hold the bow,

16:17.375 --> 16:19.917
Kakai-rata-heeha-
mwa-floopy-pa-zoing,

16:21.792 --> 16:24.709
you launch this
weird shaped rock.

16:24.792 --> 16:25.917
That's a skull.
Whoa!

16:26.000 --> 16:27.291
Ah, no.
Whoa-aw!

16:27.375 --> 16:29.542
No.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.041
Okay, come on.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.417
-Right.
-Yeah.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
Ready?
We'll launch it on three.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.625
One, two, three!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.125
Ah!

16:46.959 --> 16:49.250
(screams)

16:53.333 --> 16:55.000
The dorenbosch.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.375
He...
she totally risked his...

16:57.458 --> 17:00.458
her life
to save us...us.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.834
Man, I hope she's okay.

17:03.917 --> 17:05.625
The dorenbosch,
not the Dracaina.

17:05.709 --> 17:07.250
The Dracaina
was a complete tool.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.291
Horace...

17:12.375 --> 17:14.834
did you find some super
erythrocytes for me?

17:14.917 --> 17:16.166
No.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.458
And this is gonna be
difficult to hear.

17:18.542 --> 17:21.792
(whispering)
You have 10 minutes to live.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.500
Did you just say
I have 10 minutes to live?

17:25.583 --> 17:29.083
I guess it wasn't as difficult
to hear as I thought.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.083
So I was hoping to trick Alan
into giving me a sample

17:31.166 --> 17:32.792
but he hasn't come back yet.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.875
But don't worry, during your
last 10 minutes of life,

17:35.959 --> 17:38.792
you will receive
the highest standard of care.

17:38.875 --> 17:39.917
(Alan) Uncle Horace!

17:40.959 --> 17:42.166
Whoa.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.417
(collision)

17:44.750 --> 17:46.166
Look what I got
at the swap meet.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.000
It's a Kung Fu Santa
action figure

17:48.083 --> 17:50.083
with holly jolly death grip.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.000
Ooh, can I see it?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.792
Hmm.

17:53.875 --> 17:55.875
Whoa!

17:55.959 --> 17:57.709
Sorry,
you better get that.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.792
What are you doing?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.166
Um...

18:07.250 --> 18:10.583
I'm shooting you
with this tickle device.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.166
That's not a tickle device.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.667
This is a tickle device.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.667
What's been
going on with you?

18:19.750 --> 18:21.875
Ever since I started
embracing my normo roots,

18:21.959 --> 18:23.208
you've been acting weird.

18:23.291 --> 18:25.375
Well, the truth is...

18:27.000 --> 18:29.667
there's a superhero that
needs super erythrocytes

18:29.750 --> 18:31.667
and I was trying to
steal the sample from you.

18:31.750 --> 18:32.959
And I knew you wouldn't
give me one

18:33.041 --> 18:34.500
because you hate
superheroes now!

18:34.583 --> 18:36.041
What?

18:36.125 --> 18:37.875
No, that's exactly
why I will give it to you,

18:37.959 --> 18:40.458
to prove that normos
are the real heroes.

18:40.542 --> 18:43.125
-Well, that's terrific. Okay.
-But wait.

18:43.208 --> 18:45.750
Before you do it,
how much will it hurt

18:45.834 --> 18:47.083
on a scale from 1 to 10?

18:47.166 --> 18:49.291
Oh, I'll say one...

18:49.375 --> 18:52.208
half of 20
which is 10, so 10.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.041
I got the sample
from Alan for you.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.041
There.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.792
Now you should be fine.

19:10.041 --> 19:12.125
My son saved my life today.

19:12.208 --> 19:14.000
I don't know
how to thank him.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.000
Oh, you don't
need to thank him.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.041
You need to thank me.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.875
And if you were wondering
how to thank me,

19:20.959 --> 19:23.083
I could use a new
paddle ball toy.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
This one's obviously broken.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.500
Sorry we took so long.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.542
Someone hit me in the head with
a lava ball and my hair caught on fire.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.542
I really do hate this planet.

19:41.625 --> 19:43.166
(sighs)

19:43.250 --> 19:45.125
I didn't think
you would ever come back.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.125
Otherwise, I would have
put out some snacks.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.417
You guys like hummus?

19:49.500 --> 19:51.083
It's okay.

19:51.166 --> 19:52.750
We're just happy
to be alive.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.667
Actually I wouldn't say no
to some cheese.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.834
You boys have done well.

20:01.917 --> 20:05.208
Azimeth used his box
to protect this amulet

20:05.291 --> 20:07.875
that gives the possessor
the incredible power to...

20:08.709 --> 20:10.125
balance my coffee table.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.083
That's been bugging me
for years.

20:18.041 --> 20:21.834
Doesn't make me feel at all like
I risked my life for nothing.

20:21.917 --> 20:24.333
Well, it shouldn't because
you've passed my test

20:24.417 --> 20:26.083
and proved your bravery.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.750
I will now come back to Earth
with you and help you defeat

20:28.834 --> 20:30.792
The Annihilator.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.959
But do I have to call him
The Annihilator?

20:33.041 --> 20:35.083
He just looks like
such a Neil to me.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.792
Okay, I'm ready
to go to Earth.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.000
Uh, before you leave...

20:43.625 --> 20:46.959
you might want to put that lantern on a
timer, so it looks like someone's home.

20:48.125 --> 20:50.125
I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.083
Well, I never did get that
cheese that I was promised.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.959
Oh, I remember,
I should get a sweater.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.041
I'm used to
the temperature on Caldera.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.208
Plus, I look
really good in sweaters,

21:02.291 --> 21:05.875
but not sweater vests.
They're very unflattering.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.041
I cannot wait
to get out of here

21:11.125 --> 21:13.250
and finally have this
whole nightmare behind me.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.959
That's not the only thing
that's behind you.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.500
Wow.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.125
