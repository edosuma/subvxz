wedding series for Hulu

a reality show person.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.445
Have you guys
thought any more
about doing my show?

00:13.314 --> 00:16.450
There are people who need
to know you exist, Shaun.

00:16.584 --> 00:20.054
When I was younger,
I would have liked
to see a TV show

00:20.188 --> 00:23.624

a woman like you.

I met Shaun.

00:49.150 --> 00:55.055
Um, he was wet and cold

00:55.189 --> 00:57.491
and a bit like, um...

00:58.792 --> 01:02.196
Like, I remember thinking
he was like a lost puppy.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.865
So adorable,
but so helpless,

01:04.998 --> 01:09.837
and definitely not a likely
source of medical insight.

01:09.970 --> 01:13.241
Um, but he was the only one

01:13.374 --> 01:15.509

that little boy's life.

to my pancakes.

I really do not like

01:29.557 --> 01:31.692

There are
11 chocolate chips

CLAIRE: So much to do
in just two days.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.600
That is why Sophie

02:08.696 --> 02:11.465

a bit too.

if he likes chicken or beef

some leverage.

you'll have
a lot of it.

I could cut it

DR. ANDREWS: Rather than
bring us one case,

10:03.536 --> 10:05.405
it appears Dr. Browne
has actually brought us three.

10:06.539 --> 10:10.110
All complex,
all potentially
fatal surgeries.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.245
So, I've assembled
three surgical teams.

10:12.379 --> 10:16.249
Doctors Glassman, Browne,
and Murphy are on Team Brain.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.318
On Team Heart,
Doctors Lim and Wolke.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.254
And on Team Kidney,
Dr. Park and myself.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.024
Each of our procedures
will be enormously impacted

10:24.157 --> 10:25.258
by the other two.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.560
We need someone to oversee
the entire process.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.862
I'll do it.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.631
I was thinking of someone
a little more...experienced.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.836
You mean someone
a little more detached.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.570
I think there's
an overlap there.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.772
Not necessarily.

No extended family?

11:14.607 --> 11:17.911
Well, his father
and brother
have passed,

11:18.045 --> 11:20.013
and he doesn't
talk to his mom.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.315
Oh. That's hard.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.317

the difference.

do we have?

Removing the kidney
is the safest option.

Putting him on dialysis
for the rest of his life?

12:48.501 --> 12:50.003
It may be our only option.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.172

institutionalized.

with a better plan.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.615
I like going through
the posterior wall.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.584
It gives us
the best access
to the tumor.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.386
We'd be cutting through
a massive amount of tissue.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.188
Wouldn't that seriously
weaken his heart muscle?

13:08.321 --> 13:09.823
Not as much
as the tumor will.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.658
Hey. Making any progress?

13:12.425 --> 13:13.961
Uh, you tell me.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.063
Hmm. It'll decrease
his cardiac output.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.065
Not as much
as the tumor will.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.133
It's the same surgical plan
that I came up with.

Lucho will have

13:30.577 --> 13:32.079

won't have killed him.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.514
His heart will still
be stressed during
the other surgeries.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.283
He could have
a cardiac arrest
on the table.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.151
Which is why we'll have
a non-surgical team,

SHAUN: It still
may not give us
full access to the tumor.

To get full access,
we'd have to pop off
the skull

16:00.260 --> 16:01.894
and then burrow
through his brain.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.564
If we don't excise
all of the tumor,

16:04.697 --> 16:06.466

a waste of time.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.324

very restrictive.

requires a lot of gel.

I hate gel. It makes
my head feel tight.

to tell Lea

I think if, 30 years ago,
my wife had asked me
to wear that suit,

16:49.742 --> 16:50.843
I probably wouldn't
have married her.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.080
And if Debbie
had asked me
two years ago,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.048
I probably would have
laughed her right
out of the room.

So I don't have
to wear the suit?

have to wear it.

The brain tumor

After we remove
the kidney tumors.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.228
If we go into his brain
while his kidneys
are impaired,

17:41.361 --> 17:44.063
we risk hypertension,
AML rupture, cerebral edema.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.498
If we go into his kidneys

17:45.632 --> 17:47.267
while his brain
is under pressure,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.236
then we risk
brain herniation, stroke,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.243
There's gonna be
some serious blood loss.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.677
Well, we think
we have a better plan.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.114
We ligate the feeding artery
before tumor resection.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.715
And, if we do
the kidney surgery first,

18:02.849 --> 18:05.152
we also
minimize the risk

to long-term heart damage.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.991
safer, but more likely
to leave him compromised.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.293
Kidneys first,

18:13.426 --> 18:16.529
riskier, but more likely
to lead to a full recovery.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.811
And I'm sad
because I miss you.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.185
I miss you, too.

34:48.987 --> 34:49.888
Oh.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.932
Oh. I need to go.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.104
Oh. Shaun, you gotta
get married in...

35:07.673 --> 35:09.341
Five hours!

35:09.475 --> 35:11.543
I'm getting married
in five hours.

35:12.811 --> 35:15.013
Wha... What are you
gonna wear?

35:15.147 --> 35:16.382
I don't know.

****

35:36.235 --> 35:38.069
Don't look yet.

35:38.204 --> 35:42.073
I just need to flare out
the veil a little more.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.875
And voila.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.947
****

35:49.080 --> 35:49.881
Oh!

35:51.517 --> 35:53.151
Meghan Markle
is so jealous right now.

(CHUCKLES)

36:01.927 --> 36:04.196
(EXHALES SHAKILY)

36:04.330 --> 36:05.964
They're the most adorable
couple ever.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.634
Well, maybe second.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.002
And what I really
admire about them

36:11.136 --> 36:14.673
is that they
respect each other
for who they are.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.476
Mm.
Accept each other
as individuals.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.945
There. I canceled
the bread maker.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.513
What do you want
to get them?

36:21.647 --> 36:23.148
Ah, something that
represents us.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.316
Marriage counseling?

36:24.450 --> 36:26.618
Perfect.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.154
I've been totally shipping
Shaun and Lea.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.323
Hashtag She-Ea.

36:31.457 --> 36:35.160
Hashtag Le-Ash.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.730
Uh, that spells "leash,"
so, no.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.031
Ah.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.033
Oh, I should explain
about the matching suits.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.970
For the record,
I think they're fabulous

36:45.103 --> 36:46.305
and we look great
in them.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.174
Thank you for saying that.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.611
We look like
a couple of dorks.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.346
I was wrong about
the matchy-matchy vibe.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.781
I'm sorry.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.184
Ah, I love a man
who can admit
when he's wrong.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.653
And I may
look like a dork,
but I'm his dork.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.656
And he's mine.
Mm.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.066
Wow.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.368
You look great.

37:16.502 --> 37:19.204
I kept trying.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.040
Last night, I wore it
for two minutes,

37:22.173 --> 37:24.075
and then five,
and then ten.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.244
I got up to
44 minutes.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.182
So, 44 minutes
is your max, huh?

37:31.317 --> 37:32.618
Yes.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.687
Weddings don't run like
a Swiss watch, you know?

37:35.821 --> 37:38.189
I timed the service
at 42 minutes

37:38.324 --> 37:40.792
if I skip
the redundant parts
of my vows

37:40.926 --> 37:42.694
and exit the church
with Lea very quickly.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.433
I covered the "In sickness
and in health" part

37:47.566 --> 37:48.900
in my Hippocratic Oath.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.102
Let's hope the flower girl
keeps up the pace, huh?

37:51.236 --> 37:52.170

Yeah, you are.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.817
I'm not accepting
your resignation.

38:40.486 --> 38:41.820
That's very nice
of you, but...

38:44.255 --> 38:45.491
I can't.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.758
Well, not on your own.

38:48.527 --> 38:49.795
That's why I want you
to come stay with me.

38:50.896 --> 38:51.997
With my boss?

38:53.765 --> 38:54.833
With your friend.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.706
Please say yes.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.410
Gosling and Markle.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.980
But not Shaun and Lea.

39:45.551 --> 39:46.818
I am so sorry, Shaun.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.789
I knew the world
would be seeing us,

39:50.922 --> 39:52.824
and I wanted to show everyone
how amazing you are

39:52.958 --> 39:55.060
and how good it is to be
in a relationship with you.

39:55.193 --> 39:58.363
But...you're so uncomfortable,
aren't you?

39:58.497 --> 40:01.533
I can only last for
another 39 minutes.

40:01.667 --> 40:05.336
I love you so much
for putting yourself
through this.

40:05.471 --> 40:08.339
But we shouldn't have to.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.078
I can't wait
to marry you.

40:14.646 --> 40:15.847
But not like this.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.720
Yes.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.155
Not like this.

But there's not
gonna be a wedding.

Not today.

I'm so sorry.
We ruined your show.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.310
Wedding show
without a wedding.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.078
Yeah, pretty much.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.880
I thought this was bigger
than Shaun and me,

40:49.014 --> 40:49.948
but it shouldn't be.

40:51.583 --> 40:55.120
It's our day,
and this just isn't us.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.192
Couldn't have
figured this out
45 minutes from now?

I know.

You should take the job.

You'd make
a fantastic chief.

about fantastic.
