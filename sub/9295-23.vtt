00:13.192 --> 00:14.759
Who is it
you're looking for?

00:14.827 --> 00:17.428
Someone who can give me the
names of everyone else involved.

00:17.496 --> 00:20.698
I need you to write the story
in case I don't make it.

00:20.766 --> 00:22.166
<i>If Dalia Hassan finds out</i>

00:22.234 --> 00:24.702
that the Russians had a hand
in the death of her husband,

00:24.770 --> 00:26.104
she'll never sign the agreement.

00:26.171 --> 00:27.505
MEREDITH:
I need to speak to your mother.

00:27.573 --> 00:29.941
It's about the people
who really murdered your father.

00:30.008 --> 00:31.476
We know who is responsible.

00:31.543 --> 00:32.643
What you don't know is,

00:32.711 --> 00:33.811
those people
were working under

00:33.879 --> 00:35.813
the orders of Russian agents.

00:35.881 --> 00:37.181
Bauer made contact

00:37.249 --> 00:38.449
with Meredith Reed.

00:38.517 --> 00:40.351
My God.
You need

00:40.419 --> 00:42.286
to call her
publisher and demand

00:42.354 --> 00:44.789
that they do not
run the story.

00:44.857 --> 00:45.923
You're suggesting
muzzling the press?

00:45.991 --> 00:48.126
If you don't use the
power of your office

00:48.193 --> 00:49.927
to shut this story down,

00:49.995 --> 00:53.498
your peace agreement
won't be the only casualty.

00:53.565 --> 00:55.500
I need you to contact the FBI.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.668
Have them locate Reed

00:57.736 --> 01:00.605
and seize whatever evidence
she purports to have.

01:00.672 --> 01:02.440
Meredith Reed? FBI.

01:02.508 --> 01:03.608
You're under arrest.

01:03.675 --> 01:04.809
Let's go.
But I...

01:04.876 --> 01:06.144
You were right
about Jack.

01:06.211 --> 01:07.478
He is working
with somebody.

01:07.546 --> 01:09.847
It's James Ricker,
ex-CIA op.

01:09.915 --> 01:11.649
We found him living in a place
on Mercer Street.

01:11.717 --> 01:13.885
He's not gonna be happy
we tracked him down.

01:13.952 --> 01:15.586
<i>I need you to talk to him.</i>

01:15.654 --> 01:17.388
Get him to tell us
where Jack is.

01:17.456 --> 01:19.490
Are you good with that, or
have you still not taken sides?

01:19.558 --> 01:22.160
I want to expose this cover-up
as much as you. I'm in.

01:24.296 --> 01:25.963
(tires screech, horn honks)

01:26.031 --> 01:28.032
That's Jack Bauer!

01:28.100 --> 01:29.534
(coughing)

01:29.601 --> 01:31.736
Get up. I could just
kill you right here.

01:31.803 --> 01:33.771
<i>Do you know the name
of the person inside</i>

01:33.839 --> 01:35.139
the Russian government
who's giving the orders?

01:35.207 --> 01:36.307
I want that name.

01:36.375 --> 01:37.842
Jack.
Give me the name!

01:37.910 --> 01:39.010
I'll tell you.
Four.

01:39.077 --> 01:40.678
Three.
Mikhail Novakovich!

01:40.746 --> 01:41.712
Where's Novakovich?

01:41.780 --> 01:43.381
He's dead.

01:43.448 --> 01:45.149
Bauer just came in shooting.

01:45.217 --> 01:47.318
Mikhail Novakovich
was just murdered

01:47.386 --> 01:48.653
by Jack Bauer.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.954
What?

01:50.022 --> 01:51.756
<i>LOGAN:
As far as, uh,</i>

01:51.823 --> 01:52.757
Bauer is concerned,

01:52.824 --> 01:54.492
the trail ended
with Novakovich.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.961
Then Bauer has no idea

01:57.029 --> 01:58.796
that Novakovich was operating
under my orders?

01:58.864 --> 02:00.264
None.

02:00.332 --> 02:02.967
If you're so worried about
Bauer, you never should have

02:03.035 --> 02:05.536
given the order
to kill Renee Walker.

02:22.187 --> 02:24.188
(phone ringing)

02:25.958 --> 02:27.892
Arlo.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.361
Cole, I just picked up
a preliminary flash.

02:30.429 --> 02:32.597
Jack murdered Novakovich
at his hotel,

02:32.664 --> 02:34.265
and six of his security guards.

02:34.333 --> 02:35.466
According to a witness,

02:35.534 --> 02:37.401
Jack killed all seven men
on his own.

02:37.469 --> 02:39.103
Then fell right back
off the radar.

02:39.171 --> 02:42.106
Eden can't find
any trace of him.

02:42.174 --> 02:43.641
Does Chloe know about this?

02:43.709 --> 02:44.842
I just talked to her,

02:44.910 --> 02:46.911
and she should be
at the U.N. any minute.

02:46.979 --> 02:50.948
Cole, I know that we need
this evidence that Jack has,

02:51.016 --> 02:52.917
but this crime scene
is a slaughterhouse.

02:52.985 --> 02:56.053
Does Chloe really still
think she can pull this off?

02:56.121 --> 02:57.855
If anyone can talk Jack down,
it's Chloe.

02:57.923 --> 02:59.223
And if she can't?

02:59.291 --> 03:00.391
Then we're both
prepared to do

03:00.459 --> 03:01.525
whatever it takes
to stop him.

03:01.593 --> 03:02.760
Even when Novakovich's

03:02.828 --> 03:04.428
whole security staff couldn't?

03:04.496 --> 03:05.930
What do you want me to do, Arlo?

03:05.998 --> 03:07.999
The truth about what went down
today needs to get out,

03:08.066 --> 03:10.268
and that's not going to happen
unless we get to Jack.

03:10.335 --> 03:11.969
Look, I'm coming up
on Ricker's apartment.

03:12.037 --> 03:13.170
I'm going in.

03:13.238 --> 03:14.639
Cole. COLE: What?

03:14.706 --> 03:16.841
Ricker went to a lot of
trouble to disappear.

03:16.908 --> 03:19.010
He's not going to like
that you found him.

03:19.077 --> 03:21.078
I'm not expecting him to.

03:31.423 --> 03:33.291
TV REPORTER: You're looking
at the U.N. Plaza gardens

03:33.358 --> 03:34.458
and the podium from which

03:34.526 --> 03:35.860
all three co-sponsors

03:35.927 --> 03:38.095
of the peace treaty
will address the public

03:38.163 --> 03:41.165
following a private signing
ceremony inside the U.N.'s

03:41.233 --> 03:42.533
Council Chamber.

03:42.601 --> 03:44.035
Russian President Yuri Suvarov,

03:44.102 --> 03:45.703
the third co-sponsor
of the treaty,

03:45.771 --> 03:47.438
is en route to the U.N.

03:47.506 --> 03:49.840
where he will join
President Taylor

03:49.908 --> 03:52.143
and acting IRK President
Dalia Hassan...

03:52.210 --> 03:54.645
(computer alarm chimes)

04:00.185 --> 04:02.153
(alarm chiming stops)

04:38.724 --> 04:40.791
(knocking) COLE: Mr. Ricker,

04:40.859 --> 04:42.159
this is Agent
Ortiz, CTU!

04:42.227 --> 04:43.694
Open that door.

04:46.098 --> 04:47.431
(gun cocking)

04:54.673 --> 04:55.973
Before you pull that trigger,

04:56.041 --> 04:57.808
there's something
you ought to know.

04:57.876 --> 04:59.810
I don't place a call
in 15 minutes,

04:59.878 --> 05:02.980
every intelligence agency in the
country gets alerted about you.

05:03.048 --> 05:05.449
Weapon charges alone
will get you locked up

05:05.517 --> 05:06.817
for the duration,

05:06.885 --> 05:09.153
Or you can help us
find Jack Bauer,

05:09.221 --> 05:11.055
and we'll keep our mouths shut.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.595
You think you're protecting him?

05:17.662 --> 05:21.399
The order on Jack Bauer
is shoot to kill.

05:21.466 --> 05:24.568
He knew what
he was getting himself into.

05:24.636 --> 05:27.004
Jack's not thinking straight.

05:27.072 --> 05:29.373
Look, I read
your file.

05:29.441 --> 05:31.642
I know Jack saved your life
in Damascus.

05:31.710 --> 05:35.513
This is your opportunity
to pay back that debt.

05:35.580 --> 05:38.015
You know how this
is gonna end, right?

05:38.083 --> 05:40.217
Do you?

05:45.624 --> 05:48.125
If Jack dies today,

05:48.193 --> 05:50.194
it's on you.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.138
Hey.

06:01.206 --> 06:03.107
Wait a minute.

06:05.510 --> 06:08.279
Wait a minute.

06:08.346 --> 06:10.347
(garbled radio transmission)

06:16.521 --> 06:17.855
Thanks, Adam.

06:17.923 --> 06:19.990
(text alert tone)

06:26.298 --> 06:28.165
Director O'Brian,
Agent Burke.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.834
I have the revised security
assessment for you.

06:29.901 --> 06:32.470
Ma'am, I noticed that
Agent Ortiz's name

06:32.537 --> 06:34.371
was back on the duty
roster. That's right.

06:34.439 --> 06:37.274
He was arrested for
helping Jack Bauer.

06:37.342 --> 06:39.944
I got him a temporary clearance
so he could help us out here.

06:40.011 --> 06:42.012
He was the one who designed
the U.N. protocols

06:42.080 --> 06:43.881
in the first place.
I know.

06:43.949 --> 06:46.283
Do you really think
we can trust him?

06:46.351 --> 06:49.420
I wouldn't have gotten him
a release if I didn't.

06:49.488 --> 06:50.921
(phone ringing)
Yes, ma'am.

06:50.989 --> 06:52.990
Excuse me.

06:54.259 --> 06:56.760
(Burke clears throat)

06:57.796 --> 06:58.896
What happened?

06:58.964 --> 07:00.130
COLE:
Not good, Chloe.

07:00.198 --> 07:02.566
I think Jack's
targeting Suvarov.

07:02.634 --> 07:04.068
Is that what Ricker said?

07:04.135 --> 07:06.604
Yeah. Jack planted a bug
on Charles Logan,

07:06.671 --> 07:08.572
overheard a conversation
between the two men.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.407
Turns out Suvarov's the
one who gave the order

07:10.475 --> 07:11.575
for Renee to be killed.

07:11.643 --> 07:14.144
(sighs)
Does Ricker have a recording

07:14.212 --> 07:15.346
of that conversation?

07:15.413 --> 07:16.680
No. He wiped his system clean

07:16.748 --> 07:18.249
as soon as he saw me coming.

07:18.316 --> 07:20.751
But the surveillance rig
he gave Jack records everything

07:20.819 --> 07:22.453
to a backup,
so Jack has a copy.

07:22.521 --> 07:23.621
Good. We're
gonna need it.

07:23.688 --> 07:24.788
Why?

07:24.856 --> 07:26.624
The White House
just arrested Meredith Reed.

07:26.691 --> 07:28.492
They confiscated a data card
from her.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.160
Dana's evidence.

07:30.228 --> 07:32.329
Exactly. The recording
that Jack has

07:32.397 --> 07:33.831
is the only proof
we have now.

07:33.899 --> 07:35.099
(sighs)

07:35.166 --> 07:36.467
Chloe, I don't know

07:36.535 --> 07:38.569
that getting proof is
our first priority anymore.

07:38.637 --> 07:40.938
We have to put an alert out
on Jack.

07:41.006 --> 07:43.507
If we do that, then Pillar
will get to him first.

07:43.575 --> 07:45.209
He'll kill Jack,
and he'll destroy the recording.

07:45.277 --> 07:46.610
Chloe, we
can't stand by

07:46.678 --> 07:48.746
and let Jack assassinate
the president of Russia.

07:51.216 --> 07:53.651
No, but we can
buy ourselves time.

07:55.487 --> 07:57.288
Can change Suvarov's
motorcade route,

07:57.355 --> 07:58.522
sequester him in the U.N.

07:58.590 --> 08:00.457
Make it impossible
for Jack to get to him.

08:00.525 --> 08:03.060
Yeah, except Suvarov's gonna
be standing at that podium soon,

08:03.128 --> 08:05.396
and once he's exposed like that,
we can't protect him.

08:05.463 --> 08:07.031
That's not happening
for over an hour.

08:07.098 --> 08:08.732
If we haven't found Jack
by then,

08:08.800 --> 08:10.401
then we can put out the alert.

08:10.468 --> 08:12.136
It's still taking a big risk,
Chloe.

08:12.203 --> 08:13.404
I know.

08:13.471 --> 08:14.738
All right,
get Suvarov's route changed.

08:14.806 --> 08:16.574
But you're putting me
in charge of his security

08:16.641 --> 08:18.175
as soon as he gets to the U.N.

08:18.243 --> 08:19.410
How far out are you?

08:19.477 --> 08:20.744
I'll be there in ten.

08:20.812 --> 08:22.046
(car engine starting)

08:31.089 --> 08:34.592
(tires squeak)

08:36.361 --> 08:38.294
(garbled radio transmission)

08:38.363 --> 08:39.863
Okay.

08:39.931 --> 08:43.366
Sir, the flash
about Novakovich is going out.

08:43.434 --> 08:46.003
You wanted to speak with the
president before that happened.

08:46.071 --> 08:47.171
Ah.

08:47.238 --> 08:49.173
(exhales)
Thank you, Jason.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.275
Oh, um...

08:51.343 --> 08:53.043
do we know anything about Bauer?

08:53.111 --> 08:54.979
No. Nothing.

08:55.046 --> 08:56.847
If you don't mind
me asking, sir.

08:56.915 --> 08:59.083
What are you going
to tell the president?

09:01.820 --> 09:04.855
I think it's time she...
she knows everything.

09:12.297 --> 09:14.231
All the delegates
are present

09:14.299 --> 09:16.133
with the exception of Suvarov,
who's still in transit.

09:16.201 --> 09:18.268
He'll be given the details
once he arrives. (phone ringing)

09:20.305 --> 09:22.239
Excuse me, Tim.

09:22.307 --> 09:24.608
Yes, ma'am.

09:24.676 --> 09:26.710
I'm about to go
into the protocol meeting.

09:26.778 --> 09:27.978
What's going on?

09:28.046 --> 09:30.080
I wanted you to hear this news
from me first.

09:30.148 --> 09:31.348
What news?

09:31.416 --> 09:32.549
I tried to

09:32.617 --> 09:34.385
insulate you as long as I could,

09:34.452 --> 09:36.086
preserve your plausible
deniability, but...

09:36.154 --> 09:37.855
Just tell me what
you're talking about, Charles.

09:37.922 --> 09:41.759
Jack Bauer isn't just trying
to gather evidence

09:41.826 --> 09:43.093
about the conspiracy.

09:43.161 --> 09:45.095
He's...

09:45.163 --> 09:47.164
He's seeking retribution.

09:48.199 --> 09:50.968
Go on.

09:51.036 --> 09:53.971
Bauer just murdered
Mikhail Novakovich,

09:54.039 --> 09:56.173
along with a good
number of his staff.

09:56.241 --> 09:59.510
(whispering): So Novakovich was
responsible for the assassination

09:59.577 --> 10:01.278
of President Hassan?

10:01.346 --> 10:03.280
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

10:05.650 --> 10:07.451
Novakovich was
the ranking member

10:07.519 --> 10:09.219
of the Russian Delegation.

10:09.287 --> 10:12.322
President Suvarov is going
to demand an explanation.

10:14.259 --> 10:16.627
Actually, he's not.

10:18.463 --> 10:20.397
Are you telling me

10:20.465 --> 10:23.500
that Hassan's murder goes
all the way up to Suvarov?

10:23.568 --> 10:25.536
Yes.

10:25.603 --> 10:28.338
But the good news is
that Bauer doesn't know that.

10:28.406 --> 10:30.541
How can you be sure?

10:30.608 --> 10:33.644
Because according to a witness,
Bauer killed Novakovich

10:33.712 --> 10:35.646
before he could talk.

10:35.714 --> 10:39.349
And aside from me, Novakavich

10:39.417 --> 10:41.085
is the only person who ever knew

10:41.152 --> 10:42.853
that Suvarov
was calling the shots.

10:42.921 --> 10:45.856
Madam President,
Bauer's finished

10:45.924 --> 10:47.124
what he started,

10:47.192 --> 10:49.727
an-and Suvarov will be happy
to sweep this under the rug.

10:49.794 --> 10:51.528
An-and the peace agreement
can go forward

10:51.596 --> 10:52.796
as planned.

10:52.864 --> 10:54.131
This is...

10:54.199 --> 10:56.834
Really, we couldn't have
asked for a better outcome.

10:56.901 --> 11:00.137
Except that I am asking
Dalia Hassan to shake hands

11:00.205 --> 11:02.005
with her husband's murderer.

11:02.073 --> 11:04.274
Madam President...
Call Suvarov.

11:04.342 --> 11:09.379
Tell him that I am aware
of his involvement in this,

11:09.447 --> 11:12.750
and that I will see him
at the signing.

11:12.817 --> 11:15.552
(snaps cell phone shut)

11:23.795 --> 11:26.130
My apologies.

11:28.633 --> 11:31.135
Thank you for waiting.

11:34.105 --> 11:36.173
How did the call go?
I told the president

11:36.241 --> 11:39.276
about Suvarov's
involvement, and, um...

11:39.344 --> 11:42.880
she understood- not that
she has an alternative.

11:42.947 --> 11:44.882
Well, that's
good news, sir.

11:44.949 --> 11:46.416
PILLAR: Your new Secret
Service detail's here

11:46.484 --> 11:47.951
to escort you to the U.N.

11:48.019 --> 11:51.388
Thank you, Jason.

11:51.456 --> 11:53.957
It's been a long
road, but, uh...

11:54.025 --> 11:56.393
(chuckles):
we're almost there.

11:59.464 --> 12:01.398
(Logan groans)

12:02.433 --> 12:04.434
(slaps car twice)

12:18.583 --> 12:20.450
(phone auto-dialing)

12:20.518 --> 12:22.719
Anything new on Bauer?

12:22.787 --> 12:25.522
A security camera picked him up
leaving Novakovich's hotel.

12:25.590 --> 12:27.090
Confirmed what Berkov told us.

12:27.158 --> 12:29.560
Bauer was definitely wounded
during the attack.

12:29.627 --> 12:31.528
How badly?

12:31.596 --> 12:33.530
Badly enough that he's
gonna need treatment.

12:33.598 --> 12:35.098
Getting alerts out
to medical facilities now.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.967
All right, also let
Port Authority and INS know

12:37.035 --> 12:39.036
Bauer might be trying
to get out of the country.

12:39.103 --> 12:41.371
We'll find him- it's
only a question of time.

12:41.439 --> 12:45.108
Maybe a little quicker
than you thought.

12:45.176 --> 12:48.846
Slowly, take your weapon out
and pass it back to me.

12:48.913 --> 12:50.180
Slowly.

12:57.088 --> 12:59.523
Start the car and drive.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.759
You saw what
I did to Pavel.

13:02.827 --> 13:04.194
I didn't have
a lot of time with him.

13:04.262 --> 13:05.629
You, I've got all the time
in the world.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.131
So you either do what I say,
or I will take you apart

13:08.199 --> 13:09.132
piece by piece.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.367
Now, drive!

13:10.435 --> 13:12.069
(panting)

13:18.843 --> 13:20.944
Where are we going?

13:21.012 --> 13:23.213
The U.N.

13:23.281 --> 13:25.883
Why? You already
got what you wanted.

13:25.950 --> 13:28.085
You killed
everyone involved.

13:28.152 --> 13:29.486
Save your breath.

13:29.554 --> 13:32.890
I know about President Suvarov.

13:45.654 --> 13:48.322
Your delegations will be joining
you at the reception

13:48.390 --> 13:49.990
after the post-signing ceremony.

13:50.058 --> 13:52.660
And finally, on behalf
of the U.N. staff,

13:52.727 --> 13:55.529
I would like to say
that we are all

13:55.597 --> 13:58.699
honored to be part
of this historic occasion.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.868
Thank you for your time.

14:08.743 --> 14:11.845
Your daughter's been waiting
inside to speak to you.

14:11.913 --> 14:14.048
She says
it's important.

14:14.115 --> 14:16.317
(exhales)
Let her know

14:16.384 --> 14:18.552
I'll be right there.
Yes, ma'am.

14:22.057 --> 14:24.058
Madam President.

14:25.293 --> 14:27.194
I have something for you.

14:27.262 --> 14:28.762
It's from Omar.

14:30.599 --> 14:32.633
He wanted to
give it to you

14:32.701 --> 14:36.036
to sign the agreement, and...

14:36.104 --> 14:40.074
I'm grateful that I can
do so on his behalf.

14:42.844 --> 14:44.445
It reads:

14:44.512 --> 14:46.113
"All religions,

14:46.181 --> 14:48.015
"all this singing,

14:48.083 --> 14:49.583
"one song,

14:49.651 --> 14:51.318
peace be with you."

14:55.323 --> 14:57.124
It is a verse

14:57.192 --> 14:58.926
Omar would quote
from Rumi

14:58.994 --> 15:02.796
when he was talking about what
you and he were trying to achieve.

15:02.864 --> 15:06.033
Thank you for
seeing this through

15:06.101 --> 15:10.037
and for helping us all
do justice to his memory.

15:17.012 --> 15:19.880
Dalia, I am...

15:19.948 --> 15:21.949
I am honored.

15:22.017 --> 15:24.952
I'm very honored.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.788
Th

15:46.841 --> 15:48.709
Kayla, what is it?

15:48.777 --> 15:51.211
Meredith Reed called
the residence looking for you.

15:51.279 --> 15:53.480
I am not interested in
that woman's condolences.

15:53.548 --> 15:55.115
That is not
why she called.

15:55.183 --> 15:57.384
She says she
has information

15:57.452 --> 15:59.987
about the people who are
behind Father's murder.

16:00.055 --> 16:02.556
But we know who was behind
your father's death-

16:02.624 --> 16:04.291
extremists in our country.

16:04.359 --> 16:06.694
(whispers): She claims
that they had outside hKYp.

16:06.761 --> 16:08.529
That the Russians were involved.

16:08.596 --> 16:10.364
Why would she say such a thing?

16:10.432 --> 16:12.599
Does she have evidence,
or is this just a rumor?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.803
I don't know, but it can't have
been easy for her to call you.

16:15.870 --> 16:18.472
I don't think she would have
done so because of a rumor.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.307
What else did she say?

16:20.375 --> 16:23.110
She wouldn't say anything more
until she talked to you.

16:23.178 --> 16:25.346
She left her number.

16:28.983 --> 16:30.984
Let's call her
from the residence.

16:32.454 --> 16:35.456
(indistinct radio transmissions)

16:43.331 --> 16:46.233
Ann, President Suvarov's
motorcade is delayed

16:46.301 --> 16:48.302
five minutes because
of the new route- put out

16:48.370 --> 16:49.903
an all-agency.
How do you want it coded?

16:49.971 --> 16:51.071
Eyes only.

16:51.139 --> 16:52.072
Yes, ma'am.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.140
(sighs)

16:55.143 --> 16:56.944
Lanza, make sure
Burke reports here

16:57.011 --> 17:00.013
with a set of tactical gear
for Agent Ortiz. Yes, ma'am.

17:00.081 --> 17:03.584
Arlo's at CTU, running
the surveillance video

17:03.651 --> 17:04.917
through facial recognition
software.

17:04.986 --> 17:07.287
Still no sign of Jack.
Look, I've been thinking.

17:07.355 --> 17:08.789
Let's say we do get this
recording from Jack.

17:08.857 --> 17:10.089
What are we supposed
to do with it?

17:10.157 --> 17:11.492
I mean, if the
president's willing

17:11.559 --> 17:12.826
to lock down
Meredith Reed...

17:12.894 --> 17:14.962
She can't shut down
every media outlet in the world,

17:15.029 --> 17:16.797
which is where
we're gonna send this file.

17:16.865 --> 17:19.800
We're also gonna send it to every
government employee in the country.

17:19.867 --> 17:20.968
Legislative,
military, judiciary-

17:21.035 --> 17:22.336
that's over
a hundred thousand people.

17:22.404 --> 17:24.171
<i>How are we doing this?</i>

17:24.239 --> 17:25.439
By using CTU servers,

17:25.507 --> 17:27.808
we can distribute it
simultaneously to everyone.

17:27.876 --> 17:30.144
President Taylor won't
be able to stop the truth

17:30.211 --> 17:31.678
from getting out.

17:31.746 --> 17:32.913
Burke.

17:32.981 --> 17:34.381
Good to see yo
Sir.

17:34.449 --> 17:35.949
Did you use the
revised protocol

17:36.017 --> 17:37.584
for President Suvarov's arrival?
Yes, ma'am.

17:37.652 --> 17:39.987
We're now bringing the motorcade
into the FDR Drive ramp. Good.

17:40.054 --> 17:42.689
Make sure that Agent Ortiz
has the revised protocols.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.658
He's back in charge.

17:44.726 --> 17:47.795
Let's take a look.

18:21.729 --> 18:23.530
We're going
to the Hart Building.

18:23.598 --> 18:25.499
I want you to park underground.

18:31.072 --> 18:33.474
This guard's life
is in your hands.

18:33.541 --> 18:35.108
You make one move that
I don't like, I'm gonna

18:35.176 --> 18:36.643
kill you both,
you understand?

18:42.350 --> 18:44.284
Jason Pillar.

18:52.694 --> 18:55.095
There's no one inside.

18:55.163 --> 18:57.364
They left the building
two hours ago.

18:57.432 --> 18:59.132
Yeah, I'm just running

18:59.200 --> 19:00.434
a last-minute
security check.

19:00.502 --> 19:02.336
Of course, sir.

19:06.074 --> 19:08.342
Is there anything
else, sir?

19:11.246 --> 19:13.680
No. Thank you.

19:17.552 --> 19:18.852
Drive.

19:23.024 --> 19:24.625
(grunting quietly)

19:24.692 --> 19:26.693
(panting)

19:30.265 --> 19:32.332
Pull in over here.

19:38.439 --> 19:40.874
Slowly, with
your right hand,

19:40.942 --> 19:42.776
take the keys
out of the ignition

19:42.844 --> 19:44.678
and pass them back.

19:50.285 --> 19:52.252
Get out of the car.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.387
(panting)

19:53.454 --> 19:55.822
Now!

19:55.890 --> 19:57.524
Close the door.

19:57.592 --> 19:59.192
Put your hands
on the roof.

20:01.396 --> 20:03.230
Don't you move.

20:03.298 --> 20:06.266
Suvarov's not gonna be out on
the podium for another hour.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.434
You're not gonna
make it that long,

20:07.502 --> 20:08.502
not the way you're bleeding.

20:10.805 --> 20:13.307
(panting)

20:13.374 --> 20:15.342
Slowly,

20:15.410 --> 20:17.477
back up towards me.

20:24.786 --> 20:27.187
Stop. Turn around.

20:29.123 --> 20:31.024
Good.

20:31.092 --> 20:33.393
You're gonna
suture me up.

20:35.330 --> 20:36.396
(groans)

20:36.464 --> 20:38.665
You try and make
a move on me,

20:38.733 --> 20:40.267
the slightest twitch,

20:40.335 --> 20:42.469
I will put a bullet
in your brain.

20:42.537 --> 20:43.637
You got it?

20:43.705 --> 20:45.272
Yes.

20:46.641 --> 20:48.008
(groans)

20:51.879 --> 20:53.714
(Jack panting)

20:54.749 --> 20:56.049
(gasps)

20:58.653 --> 21:01.588
I don't understand
something.

21:01.656 --> 21:04.224
You've spent your entire career
working outside the system;

21:04.292 --> 21:06.259
you've always had a good reason.

21:06.327 --> 21:09.830
But this...
it's just blood lost.

21:09.897 --> 21:12.532
You're destroying an agreement
that took years to put together.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.502
An agreement made by
murderers and liars.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.104
(gasps)
Murderers?

21:17.171 --> 21:20.407
You're the one killing
people in cold blood.

21:20.475 --> 21:23.443
Everybody I took out had
a hand in today's attack.

21:23.511 --> 21:25.679
But who makes you
judge and jury?

21:25.747 --> 21:27.280
President Taylor,

21:27.348 --> 21:29.549
when she agreed
to the cover-up.

21:29.617 --> 21:33.320
I would have accepted
justice by law...

21:33.388 --> 21:36.990
but that was taken away
from me by people like you.

21:37.058 --> 21:41.228
So you're right-
I am judge and jury.

21:41.295 --> 21:43.764
Now, step back.

21:43.831 --> 21:45.332
Turn around.

21:46.634 --> 21:47.834
Start to move back
towards the car.

21:47.902 --> 21:49.870
Look, I came in after
Hassan and Renee were killed.

21:49.937 --> 21:52.472
I didn't have anything to do
with that, you have to believe me.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.675
Get on your knees! Please,
Bauer, I'm telling you the truth.

21:54.742 --> 21:56.710
I've got a family;
I've got a little girl.

21:56.778 --> 21:58.278
Shut up.

22:03.785 --> 22:06.053
Please...

22:06.120 --> 22:08.689
(muttering): I'm
telling you the truth.

22:08.756 --> 22:09.756
(grunts)

22:11.526 --> 22:14.227
(loud thump)

22:16.864 --> 22:18.365
(panting)

22:18.433 --> 22:20.934
(yells)

22:55.227 --> 22:57.161
Still no answer.

22:57.229 --> 22:59.564
Are you sure this is
Meredith Reed's number?

22:59.632 --> 23:01.899
It's the number she gave me.
Then why isn't she answering?

23:01.967 --> 23:04.469
I just talked to Gary
Klausner, Ms. Reed's editor.

23:04.536 --> 23:07.605
He doesn't know where she is
and has no way to reach her.

23:07.673 --> 23:10.041
He seemed very anxious
to get off the phone.

23:16.048 --> 23:17.815
Where are you going?

23:17.883 --> 23:19.350
President Taylor and I
are supposed

23:19.418 --> 23:20.885
to be sitting across the table

23:20.953 --> 23:22.954
from Yuri Suvarov
in less than an hour.

23:23.022 --> 23:25.390
If his government was involved
in murdering your father,

23:25.457 --> 23:27.792
President Taylor needs to know.

23:33.565 --> 23:35.633
TV NEWS ANCHOR: Following
the death of Omar Hassan,

23:35.701 --> 23:38.102
President Suvarov
was reportedly pessimistic

23:38.170 --> 23:40.471
about the viability
of the peace treaty.

23:40.539 --> 23:42.040
But rumors of
a Russian withdrawal

23:42.107 --> 23:43.875
were soon dismissed
by the White House,

23:43.942 --> 23:45.209
and President Suvarov
is expected

23:45.277 --> 23:47.378
to arrive at the U.N. shortly.
(knocking)

23:47.446 --> 23:48.780
Yes?

23:48.847 --> 23:50.715
Excuse me,
Madam President.

23:50.783 --> 23:52.350
It's Dalia Hassan.

23:52.418 --> 23:54.152
I'll have to call her back.

23:54.219 --> 23:55.653
She's outside, ma'am.

23:55.721 --> 23:57.822
She says it's urgent.

24:00.893 --> 24:02.527
Send her in.

24:08.834 --> 24:11.069
(clears throat)

24:14.139 --> 24:16.341
(footsteps approaching)

24:17.609 --> 24:20.712
(sighs)
Madam President, forgive me.

24:20.779 --> 24:23.247
I have just heard something

24:23.315 --> 24:24.615
that is very
disturbing.

24:24.683 --> 24:25.983
What did you hear?

24:26.051 --> 24:27.685
That the Russian government,

24:27.753 --> 24:29.387
or people within
the Russian government,

24:29.455 --> 24:31.155
were involved

24:31.223 --> 24:33.291
in the murder
of my husband.

24:33.359 --> 24:35.093
Where did you hear this?

24:35.160 --> 24:37.695
My daughter
received a phone call

24:37.763 --> 24:39.931
from the journalist,
Meredith Reed.

24:39.998 --> 24:42.033
Have you spoken
with her yourself?

24:42.101 --> 24:43.501
No.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.269
I've tried everything,

24:45.337 --> 24:48.439
but I've been
unable to reach her.

24:48.507 --> 24:51.376
I came here to ask for
your help finding Miss Reed.

24:51.443 --> 24:54.045
I need to know
if there is any truth

24:54.113 --> 24:55.546
in what she said.

24:55.614 --> 24:57.648
Dalia, we heard a rumor

24:57.716 --> 25:00.418
about the Russians
being involved as well.

25:00.486 --> 25:03.087
And you didn't tell me?

25:03.155 --> 25:04.989
No. Because we looked into it

25:05.057 --> 25:07.625
and found that there was
nothing backing it up.

25:07.693 --> 25:09.394
It was just
a frivolous accusation.

25:09.461 --> 25:11.295
Whatever else she may be,

25:11.363 --> 25:13.631
Meredith Reed is not
a frivolous woman.

25:13.699 --> 25:14.999
She came to me,

25:15.067 --> 25:18.870
someone she knew would have
every reason to doubt her.

25:18.937 --> 25:20.872
(clears throat)
Dalia...

25:20.939 --> 25:23.708
I know that you want answers...

25:23.776 --> 25:27.278
but we are signing the agreement
in less than an hour.

25:27.346 --> 25:30.782
Madam President, I feel like
you're not listening to me.

25:30.849 --> 25:34.118
Before I sign a treaty
with people who may have

25:34.186 --> 25:37.755
murdered my husband,
I need help finding this woman.

25:37.823 --> 25:39.056
Please.

25:39.124 --> 25:43.661
I will do the best I can
in the time that we have left.

25:43.729 --> 25:45.897
I don't think
I'm making myself clear.

25:45.964 --> 25:48.466
Until I determine
if her allegations are true,

25:48.534 --> 25:50.401
I will not sign this treaty.

25:50.469 --> 25:52.170
Dalia...

25:52.237 --> 25:54.972
please, be reasonable.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.808
This is my position,
Madam President.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.476
I will not change my mind.

26:00.379 --> 26:03.281
(inhales and exhales loudly)

26:03.348 --> 26:06.150
Then you...
You leave me no choice.

26:11.957 --> 26:14.459
I had Meredith Reed arrested.

26:14.526 --> 26:17.361
Why?

26:17.429 --> 26:20.531
Because her allegations
would be too damaging.

26:20.599 --> 26:22.066
That doesn't make any sense.

26:22.134 --> 26:23.968
You wouldn't arrest someone
for making

26:24.036 --> 26:26.037
false allegations.

26:29.208 --> 26:31.209
Unless they aren't false.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.647
You knew!

26:36.715 --> 26:39.951
You knew the Russians

26:40.018 --> 26:42.720
were behind my husband's death,
and you said nothing?!

26:43.755 --> 26:45.556
Dalia,

26:45.624 --> 26:47.391
I am so sorry.

26:47.459 --> 26:48.993
(sighs)

26:49.061 --> 26:52.363
It-it was an
im-impossible situation.

26:52.431 --> 26:53.865
(sighs)

26:53.932 --> 26:55.733
I was trying to protect you.

26:55.801 --> 26:57.134
Protect me?

26:57.202 --> 26:58.703
You betrayed me!

26:58.770 --> 27:02.173
Dalia, we are about
to complete the most important

27:02.241 --> 27:04.442
diplomatic action
in generations.

27:04.510 --> 27:08.312
Your husband
sacrificed his life to preserve

27:08.380 --> 27:09.647
this agreement...

27:09.715 --> 27:11.382
How dare you invoke my husband!

27:11.450 --> 27:13.584
He never would have stood
for this!

27:17.422 --> 27:20.892
This treaty happened
because he trusted you.

27:20.959 --> 27:24.395
And even though every fiber
in my being wanted to go home

27:24.463 --> 27:27.431
and grieve, I carried on
because I trusted you.

27:27.499 --> 27:29.867
But not anymore.

27:29.935 --> 27:31.435
I will not make peace

27:31.503 --> 27:33.271
with the people
who murdered my husband.

27:33.338 --> 27:34.539
Or with you.

27:34.606 --> 27:36.941
There will be
no agreement.

27:39.945 --> 27:42.046
I will be entering
a formal complaint

27:42.114 --> 27:43.915
with the United Nations,

27:43.982 --> 27:45.583
demanding that you
release Ms. Reed,

27:45.651 --> 27:48.886
and disclose whatever
evidence you've kept from me

27:48.954 --> 27:51.656
and from the rest of the world!

27:52.658 --> 27:54.392
Stop!

28:00.265 --> 28:02.900
In one hour, you will stand

28:02.968 --> 28:05.570
beside me
in the council chamber,

28:05.637 --> 28:08.139
and you will sign the treaty
your husband and I agreed to.

28:08.206 --> 28:09.540
I will not!

28:09.608 --> 28:11.742
You will!

28:11.810 --> 28:13.844
Because if you don't,

28:13.912 --> 28:18.849
my administration will disclose
hard, indisputable evidence

28:18.917 --> 28:21.385
that agents inside
your intelligence service

28:21.453 --> 28:23.788
attempted to detonate
a nuclear device

28:23.855 --> 28:26.791
on our soil,
which will give me

28:26.858 --> 28:31.028
all the justification I need
to retaliate against the IRK

28:31.096 --> 28:34.565
with the full force
of the American military.

28:34.633 --> 28:36.400
It will be decades before

28:36.468 --> 28:38.936
your country recovers.

28:41.039 --> 28:45.610
But it doesn't need
to come to that.

28:45.677 --> 28:48.813
All you have to do
is sign the agreement.

28:57.389 --> 28:59.523
Dalia?!

29:02.027 --> 29:04.028
(door slams)

30:50.993 --> 30:52.327
(clattering)

31:07.543 --> 31:09.544
(panting)

31:13.983 --> 31:16.684
First they murder my husband,
and now this woman

31:16.752 --> 31:20.388
who has lied to me
is threatening my country!

31:23.425 --> 31:25.493
(panting)

31:25.561 --> 31:28.429
I don't see a way out of this,
Madam President.

31:30.466 --> 31:34.402
We can tell the world
what these Russian bastards did,

31:34.470 --> 31:37.138
and how President Taylor
protected them.

31:37.206 --> 31:39.174
We can take our case
directly to The Hague.

31:39.241 --> 31:41.209
There is no case.

31:41.277 --> 31:43.211
No proof to support any
of these accusations.

31:43.279 --> 31:44.579
More important,

31:44.647 --> 31:46.214
there are President Taylor's
threats to consider.

31:46.282 --> 31:47.415
We cannot dismiss them.

31:47.483 --> 31:50.418
Our military can protect us
from incursion.

31:50.486 --> 31:54.422
And if necessary, we can
reactivate our nuclear program!

31:54.490 --> 31:57.358
Giving your husband's enemies

31:57.426 --> 32:00.728
exactly what they wanted
in the first place.

32:00.796 --> 32:04.065
In addition to providing her
with even more of an excuse

32:04.133 --> 32:06.701
to launch a preemptive
military strike against us.

32:06.769 --> 32:10.638
I don't care what President
Taylor said; she wouldn't dare.

32:11.707 --> 32:14.976
Can you really take that chance?

32:17.012 --> 32:18.713
(phone rings)

32:22.818 --> 32:24.819
Yes?

32:26.856 --> 32:29.424
Thank you.

32:33.462 --> 32:37.232
Yuri Suvarov's delegation
will be arriving any moment.

32:37.299 --> 32:41.236
President Taylor is expecting
you there to greet him.

32:44.773 --> 32:46.774
(panting)

32:56.418 --> 32:59.053
CHLOE:
Agent Ortiz?

32:59.121 --> 33:01.022
What's going on?

33:01.090 --> 33:02.257
I spoke with Arlo.

33:02.324 --> 33:04.192
He got a facial recognition hit
on Jack.

33:04.260 --> 33:05.593
Where?

33:05.661 --> 33:08.129
Inside our perimeter.

33:08.197 --> 33:09.764
He's here, Cole.

33:10.866 --> 33:12.901
He's been
careful to avoid

33:12.968 --> 33:14.936
all the security cameras,
but Arlo found this.

33:15.004 --> 33:16.604
It's from the 22nd floor

33:16.672 --> 33:19.307
of the Hart Building
across the street from the U.N.

33:19.375 --> 33:20.942
The software picked up
his reflection.

33:21.010 --> 33:22.644
How did he get
into the building?

33:22.711 --> 33:24.479
According to the logs,
the only person

33:24.546 --> 33:27.448
that entered the building within
the past 20 minutes was Pillar.

33:27.516 --> 33:28.983
Jack must have
taken him hostage.

33:29.051 --> 33:30.952
The windows on the east side
of the building give him

33:31.020 --> 33:32.553
a clean line of sight
down onto the podium.

33:32.621 --> 33:34.622
I'm going to
go find him.

33:34.690 --> 33:35.957
I'm going with you.

33:36.025 --> 33:37.158
You can't.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.993
It would just
cause a fight.

33:39.061 --> 33:41.262
I'm the only one that Jack will
listen to. And what if he doesn't?

33:41.330 --> 33:43.431
(sighs)

33:43.499 --> 33:45.433
Give me 20 minutes.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.235
If you don't
hear from me,

33:47.303 --> 33:48.569
we'll follow through
with our plan.

33:48.637 --> 33:50.371
Sound the alarm about Jack
and secure Suvarov.

33:52.041 --> 33:53.975
20 minutes.

33:54.043 --> 33:55.510
Okay.
And keep your comm open.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.812
I want to know what's
going on. I can't.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.247
CTU is monitoring
all frequencies.

33:59.315 --> 34:01.115
It's too risky.

34:02.151 --> 34:03.952
All right.

34:04.019 --> 34:06.287
At least take this.

34:07.323 --> 34:08.489
Thanks.

34:08.556 --> 34:10.591
Be careful.

34:13.395 --> 34:14.661
(switch clicks)

34:14.730 --> 34:16.130
(computer chirps)

34:16.197 --> 34:17.799
Where's O'Brian headed?

34:17.866 --> 34:21.034
She's running a last-minute
perimeter sweep.

34:21.103 --> 34:22.503
By herself?

34:22.571 --> 34:24.871
Keep a real-time uplink open
with Suvarov's security people.

34:24.940 --> 34:27.041
Let me know
when it's up and running.

34:27.109 --> 34:29.010
Yes, sir.

34:34.683 --> 34:36.784
(sighs)

34:36.851 --> 34:38.353
Okay.

34:39.688 --> 34:41.022
(beeps)

34:41.956 --> 34:44.158
Hey.

34:44.226 --> 34:45.827
(sighs)

34:45.893 --> 34:47.462
As long as I can remember,

34:47.529 --> 34:49.697
every time
I've had to talk to you,

34:49.764 --> 34:52.166
it seems,
for one reason or another,

34:52.234 --> 34:55.870
I've started out
by telling you how sorry I am.

34:55.938 --> 34:58.740
I'm not going to do that
to you now.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.775
You're going to hear a lot
of stories

35:00.843 --> 35:02.276
about what I've done today.

35:02.344 --> 35:04.178
Some of them may even be true.

35:04.246 --> 35:06.347
But no one, and I mean no one

35:06.415 --> 35:10.218
can tell you why I did
what I did except for me.

35:12.021 --> 35:14.055
And a lot of good people died
today.

35:14.123 --> 35:16.057
Not just President Hassan.

35:16.125 --> 35:20.228
Operatives from CTU, members of
other law enforcement agencies.

35:21.964 --> 35:24.365
ReneWalker.

35:27.169 --> 35:30.705
Who I was very close to.

35:43.185 --> 35:44.986
Yes?

35:45.054 --> 35:46.754
Thank you.

35:48.590 --> 35:51.325
President Suvarov's motorcade
has just rounded the corner.

35:51.393 --> 35:53.995
Was Mrs. Hassan notified
of his arrival?

35:54.063 --> 35:55.229
I believe
so, ma'am.

35:55.297 --> 35:56.964
Yes or no, Tim?
Which is it?

35:57.032 --> 35:58.232
Is she coming or not?

35:58.300 --> 36:00.902
Why wouldn't she be?

36:30.899 --> 36:32.934
âª âª

36:42.277 --> 36:44.278
President Taylor,

36:44.346 --> 36:47.215
that we are all here together

36:47.282 --> 36:49.383
is a tribute
to your persistence.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.788
Mrs. Hassan, I am

36:53.856 --> 36:55.790
sorry for your loss.

36:55.858 --> 36:58.392
I admired your husband
very much.

36:58.460 --> 37:01.229
We're wanted upstairs
for the press conference.

37:01.296 --> 37:03.064
Yes, of course.

37:04.099 --> 37:06.100
Mr. President.

37:10.372 --> 37:12.940
Dalia, I know that this is
very difficult for you.

37:13.008 --> 37:15.810
There is nothing left
for either of us to say,

37:15.878 --> 37:18.146
Madam President.

37:30.779 --> 37:32.714
(garbled radio transmission)

37:32.781 --> 37:34.249
Chloe O'Brian,
Director of CTU.

37:34.316 --> 37:35.717
Yes, ma'am.

37:35.784 --> 37:38.319
Master key and building
schematics you requested.

37:38.387 --> 37:39.387
(beeps)

37:40.756 --> 37:42.757
(applause)

37:53.469 --> 37:55.003
Good afternoon,
fellow delegates

37:55.070 --> 37:57.538
and ladies and gentlemen
of the press.

37:57.606 --> 38:01.843
The last 24 hours have been
the most difficult in this

38:01.911 --> 38:04.479
long and challenging road
that we've all traveled together

38:04.546 --> 38:06.247
to reach this moment.

38:06.315 --> 38:08.750
Now, the eyes
of the entire world are looking

38:08.817 --> 38:11.452
to the leaders
standing here with me now, ready

38:11.520 --> 38:15.790
to usher in a new era
of transparency, honesty

38:15.858 --> 38:18.526
and trust.

38:18.594 --> 38:21.529
President Taylor,
President Hassan

38:21.597 --> 38:24.732
President Suvarov
have each risen

38:24.800 --> 38:27.535
to this challenge
for the sake of world peace.

38:27.603 --> 38:30.238
And the treaty
that they have created together

38:30.306 --> 38:33.107
represents the culmination
of their courageous efforts.

38:33.175 --> 38:35.243
(applause)

38:40.282 --> 38:42.617
Agent Burke?

38:42.685 --> 38:44.452
Sir.
I need you to assemble

38:44.520 --> 38:46.454
a ten-man squad
and deploy them to Sector C-7.

38:46.522 --> 38:48.389
The Hart Building, sir? We
already have men on post there.

38:48.457 --> 38:49.757
Not nearly enough
if there's a threat

38:49.825 --> 38:50.925
anywhere along that corridor.

38:50.993 --> 38:52.260
Keep your men
outside the building

38:52.328 --> 38:53.528
until you hear otherwise.

38:53.595 --> 38:55.430
Yes, sir.

39:02.471 --> 39:04.472
(sighs)

39:10.079 --> 39:12.780
(panting)

39:43.212 --> 39:45.313
âª âª

39:50.853 --> 39:52.820
(sighs)

40:08.037 --> 40:09.437
(gasps)

40:09.505 --> 40:11.172
What the hell
are you doing here?

40:11.240 --> 40:12.774
You don't have to kill Suvarov.
There's another way.

40:12.841 --> 40:14.375
Who else knows
where I am?

40:14.443 --> 40:16.544
Please listen.
Who else knows?!

40:16.612 --> 40:19.347
Cole and Arlo.

40:19.415 --> 40:21.516
If I don't get you
out of here

40:21.583 --> 40:23.284
in ten minutes,
Cole's gonna send in

40:23.352 --> 40:26.320
every agent we have.

40:26.388 --> 40:27.822
(panting)

40:27.890 --> 40:29.891
Jack, they're going
to kill you.

40:29.958 --> 40:32.693
There's a standing order
to shoot you on sight.

40:32.761 --> 40:34.028
I couldn't let that happen.

40:34.096 --> 40:36.264
You shouldn't have come
after me.

40:36.331 --> 40:37.698
You're my friend.

40:37.766 --> 40:40.134
I didn't have a choice.

40:40.202 --> 40:41.803
Neither do I.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.871
(gagging)

40:45.007 --> 40:46.374
Don't fight it.
(coughs)

40:46.442 --> 40:48.976
Don't fight it.

40:49.044 --> 40:51.045
(gasping for air)

40:56.418 --> 40:58.386
(gasping stops)

40:58.454 --> 41:00.455
(Jack sighs)

41:31.086 --> 41:33.087
(rifle cocking)

41:48.403 --> 41:50.371
(phone ringing)

41:56.278 --> 41:58.212
Jason, you watching this?

41:58.280 --> 42:00.181
Jason?

42:00.249 --> 42:03.451
JACK: I have a five-five-six rifle
pointed straight at your head.

42:06.855 --> 42:08.156
Bauer.

42:08.223 --> 42:09.724
The bullet travels

42:09.791 --> 42:10.892
2,900 feet per second.

42:10.959 --> 42:12.560
If you try and move,
you're a dead man.

42:12.628 --> 42:14.061
Which means you need to
do exactly what I say.

42:14.129 --> 42:15.229
Do you understand?

42:15.297 --> 42:16.898
(gasps)

42:16.965 --> 42:19.800
Do you understand?

42:19.868 --> 42:23.971
Uh, Jack, I told you
everything I know.

42:24.039 --> 42:26.908
And you thought I believed you?

42:26.975 --> 42:28.910
(recorder clicks on)

42:28.977 --> 42:30.978
LOGAN (on tape):
And aside from me,

42:31.046 --> 42:32.446
Novakovich was the only one

42:32.514 --> 42:35.616
who knew that Suvarov
was calling the shots.

42:35.684 --> 42:37.385
(recorder clicks off)

42:39.521 --> 42:42.423
What do you want?

42:42.491 --> 42:43.858
I want you to call
President Suvarov

42:43.926 --> 42:45.226
and have him meet you

42:45.294 --> 42:47.461
where you are as soon as
the press conference is over.

42:51.867 --> 42:53.801
What am I supposed to tell him?

42:53.869 --> 42:55.303
Try the truth for a change.

42:55.370 --> 42:56.837
Tell him
you've got credible intelligence

42:56.905 --> 42:58.472
about a threat to his life.
