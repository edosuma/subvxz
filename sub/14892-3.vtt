Oh, no thanks. I’m stuffed.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.421
Jennifer?

01:28.454 --> 01:30.390
Do you really have to ask,
Larry?

01:48.509 --> 01:49.543
Thanks.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.881
What’s taking Balki so long?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.717
Oh, he wants to pick
the perfect flowers

01:56.750 --> 01:58.819
for my morning bouquet.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.121
Call an ambulance!
They’re all dying!

02:03.790 --> 02:05.726
Did‐did he say who was dying?

02:07.894 --> 02:09.729
Balki, who’s dying?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.698
All the ants from my ant farm.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.335
Except Mitch.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.772
I’ve still got a pulse on Mitch.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.708
Hold on, Mitch. Hold on.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.376
I’m gonna give him
mouth‐to‐mouth.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.247
I’ve gotta pinch
his little nose

02:27.280 --> 02:29.482
and tilt his little
head back and blow.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.693

Don’t overinflate the lungs.

Okay.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.738
Balki...he’s gone.

[sobbing]

03:32.278 --> 03:34.014
Now, what happened?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.617
Cousin, I was in the backyard

03:36.650 --> 03:39.419
picking Mary Anne’s
morning bouquet...

03:40.854 --> 03:43.857
...and I went over
to my ant farm to give them

03:43.890 --> 03:47.694
their good morning hug
and as I put them down

03:47.728 --> 03:51.464
one by one they started
dropping like...ants.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.335
I need a drink.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.508
Well, Balki,
you‐you’ve had that ant farm

04:01.542 --> 04:03.309
for about four
and a half years.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.980
That’s pretty much
the life expectancy for ants.

04:07.013 --> 04:11.451
Not these ants, cousin,
they were happy, healthy

04:13.019 --> 04:14.955
had everything to live for.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.991
Well, I tell you what you do.

04:18.024 --> 04:21.060
Get a piece of bread, go outside
throw it on the ground.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.030
By noon, you’ll have
a whole new ant farm.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.033
Now, who wants another Pop‐Tart?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.502
I do.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.472
Wait a minute, cousin.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.509
I just, I just figured out
what this all means.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.346
I’ve got the curse.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.682
The curse? What curse?

04:41.715 --> 04:44.651
The curse!
The Exterminiki curse.

04:46.086 --> 04:49.322
It brings instant death
to anything I touch.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.594
What are you talking about?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.728
Cousin, this has plagued

04:54.761 --> 04:56.997
the Bartokomous family
for generations.

04:57.931 --> 05:01.101
In 1583, an ancestor of mine

05:01.134 --> 05:02.669
Porkos the Butcher...

05:05.639 --> 05:08.341
...tried to pass off
yak knuckles as pig knuckles.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.712
Well, you can imagine
the brouhaha.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.349
The incensed population
marched up

05:16.382 --> 05:19.720
to the great and powerful
Wizard of Mypos, Dave.

05:22.088 --> 05:25.959
So he put a curse on Porkos
and all his descendants

05:25.992 --> 05:28.494
which brings
destruction and death

05:28.529 --> 05:30.797
to anything
the cursed person touches.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.001
Now let me get this straight.

05:35.035 --> 05:39.039
Your family curse has returned
and anything you touch dies

05:39.072 --> 05:41.107
which is why
your ants bought the farm.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.880
Yes.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.515
Larry, are you getting
that Pop‐Tart?

05:48.549 --> 05:49.550
Oh!

05:51.885 --> 05:55.088
Oh, Balki. Why you? Why now?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.490
Why ask why?

06:00.894 --> 06:03.163
But I’ll tell you anyway.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.465
It‐it just
kind of slipped my mind

06:05.498 --> 06:07.400
but in his twenty‐ninth year

06:07.433 --> 06:09.936
each male member
of the Bartokomous family

06:09.970 --> 06:14.040
develops a really bad case of...
Exterminiki.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.077
‐Oh, my poor‐‐
‐Don’t touch me!

06:17.110 --> 06:19.580
Don’t touch me!

06:19.613 --> 06:23.517
Stand back, Mary Anne.
I am a walking death machine.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.919
But you’re my
walking death machine.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.621
No!

06:27.654 --> 06:29.923
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
Calm down! Calm down!

06:29.956 --> 06:32.559
You’re not
a walking death machine

06:32.593 --> 06:34.094
and you’re not cursed.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.963
You‐you‐you’re
just a‐a little upset

06:36.997 --> 06:40.033
because you watched
your‐your little buddies

06:40.066 --> 06:42.168
drop dead one by one.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.639
I mean, tha‐that‐that’s
understandable.

06:45.672 --> 06:48.074
Cousin, I loved that ant farm.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.877
I will never forget the look
on little Binki’s face...

06:52.245 --> 06:54.648
...as he fell off
his little ant tractor...

06:58.118 --> 07:00.887
...and he looked up
at me as if to say...

07:01.955 --> 07:04.124
"...What’s it all about, Balki?"

07:05.892 --> 07:09.195
Well, Balki, I‐I know this is
a terrible loss for you

07:09.229 --> 07:11.732
but there’s got to be
a‐a logical explanation

07:11.765 --> 07:13.600
for what happened... I got it.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.502
Now, it was
a very hot day yesterday.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.704
The ants probably
couldn’t take the heat.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.005
I should have
let you air‐condition

07:19.039 --> 07:21.775
that ant farm when you asked.

07:21.808 --> 07:24.077
See? So I’m the one to blame.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.080
Not you. You’re not cursed!

07:27.113 --> 07:30.483
Cousin, you‐you really think
I’m not cursed?

07:30.517 --> 07:33.186
Of course not.
Don’t be ridiculous.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.862
Well, in that case, never mind.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.899
I’ll just go outside
and get Mary Anne’s bouquet.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.769
Um, listen, I don’t know
what you folks are doing later

07:48.802 --> 07:51.071
but the funeral is at two.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.010
I’d like each of you
to...say something.

08:02.949 --> 08:03.984
Mmm.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.755
Larry, I’m very proud
of the way you handled that.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.090
You handled it well.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.860
Well, over the years, I’ve‐I’ve
learned how to handle Balki.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.196
You might want to take note
of this, Mary Anne.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.766
See, you just, uh, listen
to his silly, Myposian ravings.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.637
Then you spoon‐feed him logic.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.606
He says, "Thank you, cousin..."

08:28.108 --> 08:30.110
...and everything is fine.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.019
Mary Anne’s flowers.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.222
They were fresh
just a moment ago.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.926
I killed them.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.697
I have the Exterminiki curse.
Stand back!

08:52.833 --> 08:56.069
If I touch you...you die.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.104
[instrumental music]

09:10.116 --> 09:12.719
Hi, how was Lamaze class?

09:13.787 --> 09:15.321
Same as usual.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.624
They showed the film
and Larry fainted.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.796
We did the breathing
and Larry fainted.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.167
We had a coffee break
and Larry fainted.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.938
Yeah, well, the last faint
was a fake faint.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.207
I just didn’t want
to talk to the Bickleys.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.644
I mean, it’s always "Our fetus
this" and "Our fetus that."

09:41.715 --> 09:43.817
How’s Balki doing?
Has he come out of his room yet?

09:43.850 --> 09:46.920
Oh, his mother express mailed
the Exterminiki curse remedy

09:46.953 --> 09:49.222
and he’s up there now
testing it on some flowers.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.026
Balki, how’s it goin’ up there?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.829
(Balki)
’Well, cousin,
I, I think it works.’

09:55.862 --> 09:58.364
’I haven’t dazed the daisies.’

09:58.398 --> 10:00.066
Well, he‐he probably
had to drink some

10:00.100 --> 10:03.970
disgusting concoction
made of pig by‐products.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.038
He’ll smell like a

10:05.071 --> 10:06.106
slaughterhouse all day but,
uh...

10:06.139 --> 10:07.340
...it’ll be worth it.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.994
Boy, am I lucky.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.866
I thought Mama was gonna
send me the big, ugly suit.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.208
All I have to do
is wear this suit

10:42.242 --> 10:45.879
and our lives can
get back to normal.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.148
What’s this?
The business section? Huh.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.119
[instrumental music]

11:00.460 --> 11:03.463
Okay, Balki, Balki, Balki.
Look, let me serve the salad.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.698
‐No, cousin.
‐Just let me serve the salad.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.932
‐Cousin, please, please, no.
‐You made it, let me serve it.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.968
‐Let me serve it, Balki...
‐Cousin, please don’t do this.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.835
‐Listen, listen.
‐Balki. B‐‐

11:08.869 --> 11:10.971
The only way
I’m going to get adjusted

11:11.004 --> 11:14.040
back into society
is with mitts‐on experience.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.444
‐No, I’ll‐‐
‐Cousin, please, please!

11:22.182 --> 11:24.985
I think we should
respect Balki’s feelings.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.453
We need to treat him
like any normal person

11:27.487 --> 11:29.690
with the touch of death.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.061

12:10.463 --> 12:12.398
None for me, thanks.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.783
Dressing?

12:29.816 --> 12:32.919
Uh, no. Uh, why don’t we
just go on to the main course?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.955
‐Okay?
‐Alrighty.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.124
I made roast beef.
I hope that’s okay.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.928
It’s no toad potpie
but then again, what is?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.131
Well, it smells
delicious, Balki.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.133
Right?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.503
Oh, come on, Jennifer.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.438
If Larry were dressed like
a human pot holder I’d help you.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.109
Whoa!

13:00.046 --> 13:02.415
Alright, Balki,
let me serve the roast beef.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.483
‐No, cousin, I‐‐
‐Let me serve the roast beef.

13:03.517 --> 13:04.551
‐I got to explain something‐‐
‐Let me serve it.

13:04.585 --> 13:05.552
Just let me serve it.
Don’t fight me on this.

13:05.586 --> 13:06.553
‐Do not fight me on this.
‐Listen, listen to me.

13:06.587 --> 13:08.989
Alright, just let me serve
the roast beef...

13:09.022 --> 13:11.157
‐Don’t, not today. Not tonight.
‐Give me the roast beef.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.258
[screams]

13:25.071 --> 13:27.007
I was just going to point out...

13:28.408 --> 13:31.211
...that the pan is hot.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.225
[screaming]

13:47.193 --> 13:49.930
Sorry, cousin. Sorry, cousin.
Sorry, cousin.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.364
Oh. Oh...

13:51.397 --> 13:54.334
Would you? Would?
No, don’t, don’t, don’t worry.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.302
I have a surprise for you.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.975
I baked bread.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.111
‐Is it hot?
‐No.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.347
Oh good, good. Bread is good.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.984
Nice, soft, safe bread.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.258
Have these knives
been sharpened?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.093
No! No! No!

14:20.126 --> 14:23.129
No bread! No bread.
Just no, no, put the knife down!

14:23.163 --> 14:25.031
Put the knife down!

14:30.937 --> 14:32.939
‐I almost forgot the coffee.
‐No! No! No, no!

14:32.973 --> 14:37.143
No coffee! No! Put it back!
Just put it back! Put it back!

14:37.177 --> 14:38.945
Alright, alright,
now come on. Sit down.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.480
Just sit down. Sit down!

14:40.514 --> 14:43.584
Sit! Sit! Sit!

14:43.617 --> 14:45.318
Stay! Stay.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.520
Alright.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.025
Now, Balki, tell me.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.563
How long can we expect
this curse to last?

14:56.597 --> 15:00.233
Well, the average shelf‐life
of a curse

15:00.266 --> 15:03.136
is somewhere in between
four days and...

15:04.304 --> 15:05.939
...47 years.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.176
Forty seven years?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.712
Well, how do we know
when it’s over?

15:11.745 --> 15:15.015
Well, could it be when your
friends are wearing their dinner

15:15.048 --> 15:17.350
and suffering
third‐degree burns?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.454
No, that only happens
when you throw

15:21.487 --> 15:23.557
a dinner party on a volcano.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.669
Cousin, you know
the curse is over

15:35.702 --> 15:39.472
when you touch someone with your
bare hands and they don’t die.

15:39.506 --> 15:44.511
Until then, my flesh
must not touch another’s.

15:44.545 --> 15:47.447
Oh, Balki, you’re just like
the boy in the plastic bubble.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.052
I wish we had
a bubble built for two.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.158
No!

16:00.193 --> 16:02.162
No. No.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.730
We must not.

16:03.764 --> 16:05.699
God, I almost
kissed you to death.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.002
Mary Anne,
you’re gonna have to go

16:09.035 --> 16:11.271
to your mama’s house
for a few days.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.374
Well, it’ll rip my heart out
but if you think it’s best...

16:15.308 --> 16:18.011
What is the matter with you?

16:18.044 --> 16:19.412
There is no curse!

16:19.445 --> 16:22.182
Are Jennifer and I
the only sane ones here?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.152
Well, actually,
I thought I’d go with Mary Anne.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.457
What?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.294
Well, Larry, nine times out
of ten, strange as it may seem

16:34.327 --> 16:36.162
Balki’s Myposian myths
turn out to be true.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.230
I mean, remember
the time he wore that hat

16:37.263 --> 16:39.432
with the weather vane on it
and he made it rain?

16:46.607 --> 16:48.241
Come on, Mary Anne, let’s pack.

16:55.215 --> 16:59.285
Well, great. This is just great.

16:59.319 --> 17:03.056
You‐you’ve driven
my wife from my home.

17:03.089 --> 17:06.291
I’m sorry, cousin.
Can I freshen your iced tea?

17:06.326 --> 17:07.594
Yeah, sure.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.396
Well, this has been
quite a day.

17:45.699 --> 17:49.703
My wife has left me,
my career is over

17:49.736 --> 17:53.439
and I’m eating take‐out dinner
with Oven Mitt Man.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.880
Maybe I’m the one who’s cursed.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.282
Oh, cousin, you’re not cursed,
except maybe...

18:03.550 --> 18:06.219
...in the fact that
you have me as a cousin.

18:16.663 --> 18:19.365
Hey, cousin, they‐they
gave me extra coleslaw.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.466
You want it?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.435
No, I do not want your coleslaw.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.139
I do not want your coleslaw.

All I want is to sit
and enjoy my dinner

18:28.909 --> 18:31.477
maybe watch a little TV.

18:31.512 --> 18:33.580
And don’t even think
about using the remote.

to take off my mitts

19:10.884 --> 19:12.819
and give you
the Heimlich maneuver?

19:18.258 --> 19:20.861
I’m getting a little sick
of your pathetic attempts

19:20.894 --> 19:22.563
to get me to take off my mitts.

19:24.765 --> 19:26.232

20:04.838 --> 20:06.272
I’ll go get some
from the pantry.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.740
Okay, I’ll play along.

20:39.773 --> 20:42.709

what just happened?

Yes.

You almost let me die!

No, cousin, I touched you
with my bare hands
