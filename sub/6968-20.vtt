01:05.941 --> 01:09.111
- Oh, Daddy. Cut it out!
- I knew it was you, Dad.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.865
- Quit picking on your brother. He loves you.
- No, I don't.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.742
- I'm glad you're back home, Dad.
- Not as glad as I am.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.120
Did you see a lot of weird stuff this year?

01:18.161 --> 01:22.708
Yep. It was the weirdest show ever. But your
mother thinks you're getting ready for bed.

01:22.749 --> 01:27.004
If she finds you guys still in the pool,
she's gonna kill me. So come on!

01:28.046 --> 01:31.717
Quit your whinin'.
Come on, or there's no bedtime story.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.760
Out you go. That's it.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.906
What the hell...?

02:12.907 --> 02:16.907
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 20 - Humbug

03:01.181 --> 03:04.560
- What happened?
- Nothing you can ascertain from that photo.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.813
He suffered from ichthyosis,
a congenital skin disease...

03:07.896 --> 03:11.316
...characterised by the shedding
of the epidermis as scales.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.654
This shows the entry wound
of the undetermined weapon.

03:15.737 --> 03:20.367
No other injuries were inflicted.
No organs were removed or cannibalised...

03:20.450 --> 03:23.161
...and there's no signs
of sexual molestation.

03:23.245 --> 03:27.165
That's 48 attacks over the last 28 years...

03:27.249 --> 03:30.377
...occurring in every state
in the continental US almost...

03:30.460 --> 03:33.088
...the first in Oregon, the last five in Florida.

03:33.172 --> 03:37.384
Victims range from all different
age groups, races. Both male and female.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.555
The mutilations appear so motiveless
one would suspect a form of ritual...

03:41.638 --> 03:43.682
...yet they adhere to no known cult.

03:44.016 --> 03:48.187
A serial killer would normally escalate
the level of violence of his attacks...

03:48.270 --> 03:51.064
...over such an extended period of time.

03:51.148 --> 03:55.444
So what do you think, Scully?
What are your initial thoughts?

03:56.945 --> 04:01.074
Imagine going through
your whole life looking like this.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.754
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.048
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:

04:17.132 --> 04:20.427
he leadeth me beside the still waters.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.596
He restoreth my soul:

04:22.679 --> 04:27.100
he leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.729
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

04:30.812 --> 04:32.856
...I will fear no evil:

04:32.940 --> 04:35.108
for thou art with me;

04:35.192 --> 04:38.737
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

04:39.363 --> 04:43.575
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

04:43.951 --> 04:46.453
thou anointest my head with oil;

04:46.537 --> 04:48.956
my cup runneth over.

04:49.039 --> 04:52.876
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me...

04:53.168 --> 04:55.629
...all the days of my life:

04:55.712 --> 04:59.508
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever.

05:00.092 --> 05:04.471
We are gathered here today to mourn
the passing of Jerald Glazebrook...

05:05.055 --> 05:10.602
...beloved husband, father,
friend and entertainer.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.605
We mourn not only the passing...

05:13.689 --> 05:18.193
...of a man who overcame
the obstacles of his earthly incarnation...

05:18.986 --> 05:24.366
...but also the passing of the love
that dwelled within his all-too-human heart.

05:25.784 --> 05:29.246
We mourn the passing of
the admiration and the respect...

05:29.621 --> 05:34.251
...he instilled in all
of his professional colleagues.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.547
We mourn the passing of
the laughter and the enjoyment...

05:38.630 --> 05:41.800
...he brought each audience who saw him.

05:41.884 --> 05:45.387
For although Jerry was
a world-renowned escape artist...

05:45.470 --> 05:49.725
...there is one strongbox
from which none of us can escape.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.232
Help me.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.321
Put him down over there.

06:18.754 --> 06:24.092
Not having known the deceased personally,
I'm in no position to perform a proper eulogy.

06:24.176 --> 06:27.262
I'm sure he was a nice guy,
et cetera, et cetera.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.098
But as an admirer of his work,
I am in a position...

06:30.182 --> 06:32.935
...to perform an impromptu tribute
in his honour.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.355
Namely, ramming this spike into my chest!

06:39.358 --> 06:43.695
- Don't you have any respect?
- I think I hit my left ventricle!

06:43.779 --> 06:45.864
Get back, fascists!

06:47.407 --> 06:49.493
Get him outta here!

06:54.373 --> 06:56.375
I can't wait for the wake.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.879
On his VICAP form,
Jerald Glazebrook was listed as an "artist".

07:00.963 --> 07:04.466
Jerry was an artist.
The best escape artist since Houdini.

07:04.550 --> 07:09.763
He should've been headlining Vegas, but his
condition kept him on the sideshow circuit.

07:09.847 --> 07:14.434
- I didn't realise that sideshows still existed.
- There are two or three still around.

07:14.518 --> 07:18.856
I got the impression that Glazebrook
wasn't the only performer residing here.

07:19.231 --> 07:23.110
The town was founded in the '20s
when some of Barnum & Bailey's troupes...

07:23.193 --> 07:25.404
...came down in the winter off-seasons.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.949
This town's history might help
explain our case's history.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.244
A sideshow performer
would have toured much of the country.

07:32.327 --> 07:36.498
And their isolation from society,
caused by their physical deformities...

07:36.582 --> 07:39.626
...could have built up
pathological resentment...

07:39.710 --> 07:41.295
Now, now, hold on a second.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.087
Now, now, hold on a second.

07:42.171 --> 07:45.132
Around here we refer to them
as "very special people".

07:45.257 --> 07:49.178
They may be different on the outside,
but it's what's inside that counts.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.554
And on the inside...
they're as normal as anybody.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.598
And on the inside...
they're as normal as anybody.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.767
Until arrest, many serial killers...

07:55.851 --> 07:59.813
...are considered by their friends
and family to be quite normal.

07:59.897 --> 08:03.525
If you regard them as normal,
you must consider the possibility...

08:03.609 --> 08:06.653
...that they are capable
of committing these crimes.

08:06.737 --> 08:10.240
It's been my experience
that other people have a harder time...

08:10.324 --> 08:14.077
...accepting these people's deformities
than they do themselves.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.747
Sheriff, uh... what is this?

08:16.830 --> 08:22.044
This design here. It's copyrighted
by Hepcat Helm. Is that a local artist?

08:22.252 --> 08:26.006
A bit too local. His workplace
is right behind my station house.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.926
Do you think that we could meet Hepcat?

08:31.261 --> 08:34.472
# Watch my eyes when you light them up

08:34.556 --> 08:36.767
# Listen to me whine like a heart shook up

08:36.892 --> 08:38.977
Hepcat.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.520
Hepcat!

08:40.604 --> 08:42.648
# I'm in a frenzy

08:46.777 --> 08:50.656
- Who are the rubes?
- These are FBI agents Scully and Mulder.

08:51.365 --> 08:54.701
This is Hepcat Helm.
He operates a carnival fun house.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.455
Oh, man! How many times
have I told you not to call it that?

08:59.498 --> 09:03.919
It's not some rinky-dink carny ride.
People go through it, they don't have fun.

09:04.002 --> 09:07.840
They get the hell scared out of 'em.
It's not a fun house.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.884
- It's a tabernacle of terror.
- It's a fun house.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.929
I wanted to ask you about
this menu illustration.

09:14.012 --> 09:19.268
I recognise most of the historical portraits
you've drawn here, but what's this here?

09:20.352 --> 09:22.437
It's the Fiji Mermaid.

09:23.105 --> 09:26.775
- Is that what that thing is?
- What's the Fiji Mermaid?

09:27.401 --> 09:30.362
The Fiji Mermaid. It's... it's the Fiji Mermaid!

09:30.654 --> 09:34.950
It's a bit of, uh... humbug
Barnum pulled in the last century.

09:35.033 --> 09:38.996
Barnum billed it as a real live mermaid
but when people went in to see it...

09:39.079 --> 09:43.625
...all they saw was a real dead monkey
sewn onto the tail of a fish.

09:43.709 --> 09:47.254
- A monkey?
- A mummified monkey.

09:47.337 --> 09:51.550
It supposedly looked so bad,
he had to exhibit it as a "genuine fake".

09:51.633 --> 09:54.595
But see? That's why Barnum was a genius.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.931
You never know where the truth ends
and the humbug begins.

09:58.140 --> 10:02.603
He came right out and said this
Fiji Mermaid thing is just a bunch of BS.

10:02.936 --> 10:08.108
That just made people wanna go and see it
even more. So I mean... who knows?

10:08.775 --> 10:14.323
Maybe for box-office reasons Barnum
hawked it as a hoax, when in reality...

10:14.573 --> 10:16.575
The Fiji Mermaid was a reality.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.955
Sheriff, we're gonna need
a place to stay tonight.

10:22.039 --> 10:26.043
There are lodgings right across the way,
but, uh... what's all this about?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.921
These tracks were found
at several past crime scenes.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.048
They've defied identification...

10:31.131 --> 10:34.968
...but one expert speculated
that they might be simian in nature.

10:35.052 --> 10:38.597
You're not telling me these tracks
were made by the Fiji Mermaid?

10:38.680 --> 10:42.017
Do you recall what Barnum
said about suckers?

10:59.076 --> 11:01.995
Tell me, have you done much
circus work in your life?

11:02.079 --> 11:07.251
And what makes you think I've ever spectated
a circus? Much less been enslaved by one.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.212
Many citizens here were circus hands
and I thought...

11:10.295 --> 11:13.715
You thought that because
I am a person of short stature...

11:13.799 --> 11:19.179
...that the only career I could procure for
myself would be one in the so-called big top.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.726
You took one quick look at me and decided
that you could deduce my entire life.

11:24.977 --> 11:30.357
Never would it have occurred to you
that a person of my height...

11:30.440 --> 11:33.610
...could have possibly obtained a degree...

11:33.694 --> 11:35.779
...in hotel management.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.867
- I'm sorry. I meant no offence.
- Well, then, why should I take offence?

11:40.325 --> 11:44.496
Just because it's human nature
to make instantaneous judgments of others...

11:44.580 --> 11:47.374
...based solely upon
their physical appearances?

11:47.457 --> 11:50.002
I've done the same thing to you, for example.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.546
I've taken in your all-American features...

11:52.629 --> 11:56.383
...your dour demeanour,
your unimaginative necktie design...

11:56.675 --> 11:59.595
...and concluded
that you work for the government.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.097
An FBI agent.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.184
But do you see the tragedy here?

12:05.267 --> 12:09.938
I have mistakenly reduced you
to a stereotype, a caricature...

12:10.022 --> 12:14.860
...instead of regarding you
as a specific, unique individual.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.237
But I am an FBI agent.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.246
Register here, please.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.209
Tell me, have you done much
circus work in your life?

12:30.292 --> 12:32.628
I was on the stage for most of my life.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.672
I was a headliner.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.675
Did it not bother you
to have people staring at you?

12:38.759 --> 12:42.554
Best work I ever had.
All I had to do was stand there.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.474
Occasionally I'd say...

12:45.557 --> 12:49.603
..."Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet my brother Leonard."

12:50.479 --> 12:53.565
"Excuse him-he's a little shy."

12:53.649 --> 12:56.652
Big laughs, I tell you. Big laughs.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.820
Why did you give it up?

12:58.904 --> 13:02.199
Mr Nutt, the kind-hearted manager here...

13:02.282 --> 13:09.540
...convinced me that to make a living by
displaying my deformity lacked dignity.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.125
So now I carry other people's luggage.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.505
I believe these are your trailers.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.634
If they are not, then I am wrong.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.221
Oh.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.891
That's most considerate.
Thank you very much.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.479
Goodnight.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.232
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.152
No. No, that's not what I meant.

13:39.236 --> 13:42.948
I didn't mean to imply we had bedbugs.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.368
I meant to say don't let... Don't let the...

13:46.577 --> 13:48.412
The Fiji Mermaids bite.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.374
Yes, that's right. The Fiji Mermaids.
That's right.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.878
That's... That's exactly...

13:56.712 --> 13:59.548
Mulder, what is this Fiji Mermaid business?

13:59.631 --> 14:03.051
Every murder inquiry begins with
a list of possible suspects.

14:03.135 --> 14:06.555
You should try not to be so exclusive, Scully.

14:06.638 --> 14:12.019
As long as you try not to let the atmosphere
here distort your list all out of proportion.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.021
# I'm in a frenzy

14:16.565 --> 14:17.733
# Frenzy

14:19.610 --> 14:22.571
# This love gushes from my heart

14:22.863 --> 14:25.199
# Like water from a spout

14:26.325 --> 14:29.286
# You build a flame from a tiny spark

14:29.369 --> 14:32.539
# You can really knock me out- Yeah!

14:32.873 --> 14:35.542
# Ease my mind with your real cool line

14:35.626 --> 14:39.087
# Daddy, fill my soul with love divine

14:39.296 --> 14:42.090
# When you say you're mine oh mine

14:42.174 --> 14:44.009
# I'm in a frenzy

15:03.779 --> 15:05.864
What the hell...?

16:47.591 --> 16:49.676
Uh... ma'am?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.845
The sheriff, he wants to see you.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.817
There's been another murder.

17:07.653 --> 17:11.906
There's some blood on the window
we should send to the lab.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.954
- Why run a test on the victim's blood?
- No, not this window. This window.

17:19.289 --> 17:24.211
It seems to be the point of entry and there's
some blood on the outside of the window.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.339
Why would there be blood before the attack?

17:28.423 --> 17:32.094
Why didn't the attacker
just come through the open door?

17:33.387 --> 17:36.348
For a person to crawl
in and out of these windows...

17:36.431 --> 17:38.767
...they'd have to be a contortionist.

17:38.851 --> 17:42.187
Or just plain crazy. Or both.

17:54.157 --> 17:58.287
While they're performing
the autopsy, I wanna go down to the...

18:19.016 --> 18:23.854
How many people do you know that can get
out of a straitjacket in under three minutes?

18:23.937 --> 18:26.398
Fortunately, none.

18:26.982 --> 18:31.486
We caught your act at the funeral.
That was some trick with the railroad spike.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.866
Doctor Blockhead does not perform tricks.

18:36.992 --> 18:44.333
Doctor Blockhead performs astounding acts
of body manipulation and pain endurance.

18:48.045 --> 18:52.966
You must be one of those rare individuals
whose nerve endings don't register pain.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.639
You just keep tellin' yourself that.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.227
Have you ever performed this...
act on anyone else?

19:03.894 --> 19:08.398
Are you sick? I tell audiences if they're
stupid enough to try this themselves...

19:08.482 --> 19:12.277
...they'll end up with a slight lobotomy.
I am a professional.

19:12.528 --> 19:16.365
Exactly how does one become
a professional, Blockhead? May I?

19:17.658 --> 19:21.662
In my homeland of Yemen
I studied with yogis, fakirs and swamis...

19:21.745 --> 19:24.915
...learning the ancient arts
of body manipulation.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.709
But most men know nothing of these arts.

19:27.793 --> 19:31.713
Did you know that through
the Chinese practice of Tie Bu Shan...

19:31.797 --> 19:34.967
...you can train your testicles
to draw up into your abdomen?

19:35.050 --> 19:37.386
I'm doing that as we speak.

19:39.596 --> 19:42.641
I saw him this morning by the river.
He was eating a fish.

19:42.724 --> 19:46.103
He knows between-show snacks'll
ruin his appetite.

19:46.186 --> 19:51.191
I could be mistaken. Maybe it was another
bald, jigsaw-puzzle-tattooed naked guy.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.694
Is this... man also a body manipulator?

19:53.944 --> 19:56.864
No. In the classical sense,
the Conundrum's a geek.

19:56.947 --> 19:59.658
- He eats live animals.
- He eats anything.

19:59.741 --> 20:05.330
Live animals, dead animals, light bulbs,
corkscrews, battery cables, cranberries.

20:05.956 --> 20:09.543
- Human flesh?
- Only the Conundrum can answer that.

20:09.626 --> 20:13.964
But... he doesn't answer questions.
He merely poses them.

20:14.047 --> 20:17.718
When an audience partakes in
the Conundrum's human piranha act...

20:17.801 --> 20:20.220
...they are left to ask themselves...

20:22.181 --> 20:24.349
Why?

20:24.641 --> 20:27.060
But where are my manners?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.485
Thank you.

20:54.463 --> 20:57.007
It's an old sleight of hand
my uncle taught me.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.594
He was only an amateur magician,
but he was better than those two.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.305
I'll go to the lab to test
the blood on the window...

21:03.388 --> 21:05.766
...against the blood on Blockhead's nail.

21:05.849 --> 21:08.602
Everybody's uncle's an amateur magician.

22:02.072 --> 22:04.032
Welcome to my museum.

22:04.116 --> 22:07.536
May I put to rest any questions
you may have conjured?

22:07.619 --> 22:11.039
I was just reading about
the fascinating life of Chang and Eng...

22:11.123 --> 22:14.751
...and, uh... wondering
if their death was just as fascinating.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.045
Oh, very much so.

22:17.129 --> 22:20.299
On a cold January eve in 1874...

22:20.382 --> 22:24.595
...Eng awoke to find his brother had
passed away during the course of the night.

22:24.678 --> 22:28.640
A few hours later,
Eng himself departed from this world.

22:28.724 --> 22:33.437
Now, these facts themselves may be
less than fascinating, but imagine.

22:33.520 --> 22:37.149
Imagine being Eng, and lying there...

22:37.232 --> 22:40.736
...knowing that essentially
half your body was now dead.

22:40.819 --> 22:43.238
That the rest must inevitably follow.

22:43.322 --> 22:46.491
And being able to do about it -
absolutely nothing.

22:48.744 --> 22:53.916
At the autopsy it was officially concluded
that Chang died of a cerebral haemorrhage.

22:53.999 --> 22:58.295
- What was the official cause of Eng's death?
- Fright.

23:01.673 --> 23:05.052
Do you have any information
on blockhead or geek acts?

23:05.302 --> 23:08.263
This is an historical collection
on human curiosities.

23:08.347 --> 23:11.767
- Blockheads are skilled performers.
- Like magicians?

23:11.850 --> 23:14.728
Like sword swallowers
who really do swallow swords.

23:15.187 --> 23:19.483
And geeks are neither skilled nor curiosities.
They're merely unseemly.

23:19.775 --> 23:23.570
- Not even attaining the level of gaffs.
- Gaffs?

23:26.573 --> 23:30.244
Observe closely the dissimilarity
of the facial features.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.913
Conjoined twins are always identical.

23:32.996 --> 23:35.541
These gentlemen are phonies. Gaffs.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.544
Sort of like the Fiji Mermaid?

23:40.254 --> 23:43.423
You're investigating
the Alligator Man's murder, yes?

23:43.590 --> 23:47.386
I have something I believe
you might find of some interest.

23:51.265 --> 23:54.643
What does this have to do with
the Glazebrook murders?

23:54.726 --> 23:58.564
I've recently come into possession
of an authentic PT Barnum exhibit.

23:58.647 --> 24:01.233
I don't show this display
to all my customers -

24:01.316 --> 24:05.070
only those with the intellectual
curiosity to appreciate it.

24:05.153 --> 24:07.489
Barnum billed it as a great unknown.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.368
I must first ask of you two favours.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.871
Tell no soul what you witness in here.

24:14.621 --> 24:18.834
- And the second favour?
- An additional donation of five dollars.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.420
Does Agent Scully know
that you're under her crawlspace?

25:45.504 --> 25:49.174
I was merely repairing
the plumbing on this unit.

25:49.258 --> 25:53.262
I know what you're thinking, my friend,
but you are grossly mistaken.

25:53.345 --> 25:58.392
Not being of so-called average height does
not mean I must get my thrills vicariously.

25:58.475 --> 26:03.021
Not all women are attracted to
overly tall, lanky men such as yourself.

26:03.105 --> 26:07.985
You'd be surprised how many women
find my size intriguingly alluring.

26:08.068 --> 26:10.320
You'd be surprised how many men do, too.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.326
Ach!

26:27.087 --> 26:31.383
Oh, it's you.
Has Mr Nutt finished with the plumbing?

26:32.092 --> 26:37.389
The blood samples matched but were both
O-positive. They went for further analysis.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.975
I ran a background check
on Doctor Blockhead.

26:40.058 --> 26:43.145
His real name is Jeffrey Swaim
and he wasn't born in Yemen.

26:43.228 --> 26:46.398
He was born in Milwaukee.
He does not hold a doctorate.

26:48.108 --> 26:51.111
I ended up running a bit of
a background check myself.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.488
- On who?
- On an orphan...

26:53.572 --> 26:57.743
...discovered in the wild forests
of Albania in 1943.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.412
"Although adept at catching his own food...

27:00.495 --> 27:03.540
...he could not speak,
save for a few savage grunts."

27:04.208 --> 27:09.463
"Brought to this country, he was exhibited in
a locked cage owing to his feral ferocity...

27:09.755 --> 27:13.800
...where he would terrify onlookers
by devouring chunks of raw meat."

27:14.676 --> 27:17.971
"For reasons I could not ascertain,
he ran away from the circus...

27:18.055 --> 27:22.976
...and spent a number of years roaming about,
taking on a number of nondescriptjobs."

27:23.435 --> 27:27.981
"Eventually he wound up in Gibsonton,
where he began a career in law enforcement...

27:28.065 --> 27:31.693
...and has spent the past
four terms serving as sheriff."

27:31.777 --> 27:33.987
You're talking about Sheriff Hamilton?

27:34.071 --> 27:36.615
Before becoming Sheriff Hamilton...

27:36.782 --> 27:40.494
...James Hamilton was
Jim-Jim the Dog-Faced Boy.

28:43.557 --> 28:47.769
You know, Scully, hypertrichosis
does not connote lycanthropy.

28:47.853 --> 28:50.814
- What are you implying?
- We're being discriminatory.

28:50.898 --> 28:56.403
Just because a man was once overly hairy
why suspect him of aberrant behaviour?

28:56.486 --> 28:59.740
- Like assuming guilt based on skin colour?
- Yeah.

29:20.886 --> 29:23.305
May I ask what you're doing?

29:24.556 --> 29:26.642
We're exhuming...

29:27.976 --> 29:30.145
...your potato.

29:30.229 --> 29:32.523
May I ask why?

29:36.485 --> 29:41.615
It's been documented that many serial killers
possess a fascination with police work...

29:41.698 --> 29:45.202
...some of them even holding
positions on their local force.

29:45.285 --> 29:49.456
So, surveillance of investigation
team members is often utilised as a...

29:49.540 --> 29:52.251
We found out you used to be
a dog-faced boy.

29:59.716 --> 30:02.594
Boy, look how skinny I was back then.

30:03.428 --> 30:05.764
- So, that is you?
- Oh, sure.

30:05.848 --> 30:08.433
I spent the first half of my life as Jim-Jim.

30:08.517 --> 30:10.811
One day I noticed a bald spot on my head...

30:10.894 --> 30:14.314
...and realised I was losing my hair
and my career as well!

30:14.398 --> 30:17.568
Eventually all the hair went -
on top of my head anyways.

30:17.651 --> 30:22.030
The rest of my body's still pretty hairy,
which is why I never go to the beach.

30:22.322 --> 30:25.075
That doesn't quite explain the potato.

30:25.158 --> 30:28.036
I got, uh... some warts on my hand.

30:28.787 --> 30:31.206
That doesn't quite explain the potato.

30:31.290 --> 30:36.461
To get rid of warts, you rub a sliced potato
on your hand and bury it under a full moon.

30:39.590 --> 30:42.718
The investigation isn't
going too well, is it?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.886
So tell me, Commodore.

31:25.969 --> 31:30.182
Why are the weirdos the only ones
that pay their rent cheques in advance?

31:35.437 --> 31:37.356
I warn you, you tattooed cretin!

31:37.439 --> 31:42.861
I have a licensed firearm and I am more
than eager for an opportunity to use it.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.231
I found him.

32:19.314 --> 32:22.276
He's dead. He's dead.

32:25.737 --> 32:30.075
Lanny says all the doors and
windows were locked from the inside.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.244
Scully, come here.

32:33.996 --> 32:36.081
He was like a brother to me.

32:39.585 --> 32:44.298
I don't know if a contortionist could get
through that doggy door, but look at this.

32:49.386 --> 32:51.471
Lanny! Lanny!

32:52.347 --> 32:54.808
Take it easy. You're gonna hurt yourself.

32:55.017 --> 32:57.936
- So what?
- So you might hurt me in the process.

32:59.813 --> 33:04.401
He gets this way sometimes.
I'll have to toss him in the drunk tank.

33:04.860 --> 33:07.112
We'll take Jeffrey Swaim into custody.

33:07.196 --> 33:09.198
Come on, Lanny. Let's go.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.700
You know, Mulder, for a while...

33:11.783 --> 33:15.579
...I was beginning to suspect this case
involved something a bit more...

33:15.662 --> 33:17.748
Freakish?

33:19.333 --> 33:21.668
You shouldn't complain about banality...

33:21.752 --> 33:25.005
...when your main suspect
is the Human Blockhead.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.383
It's open!

33:29.343 --> 33:32.054
Mr Swaim? Federal agents. We're here to...

33:33.055 --> 33:36.725
It's a variation of
an American Indian sun dance ritual.

33:37.309 --> 33:40.854
I suspend myself by these hooks...

33:42.064 --> 33:45.984
...and the pain becomes
so unbearable, I leave my body.

33:46.527 --> 33:50.405
If people knew the true price of spirituality,
there'd be more atheists.

33:50.489 --> 33:54.409
We're taking you into custody
to question you about some murders.

33:55.202 --> 33:57.496
I don't answer till I talk to my lawyer.

33:57.579 --> 34:00.791
- Who's your lawyer?
- I represent myself.

34:00.874 --> 34:03.752
If you're uncooperative,
I'll have to handcuff you.

34:03.836 --> 34:06.255
What gives you fascists
the right to do that?

34:06.338 --> 34:10.132
- Did I not say we're federal agents?
- Did I not say I'm an escape artist?

34:16.014 --> 34:18.100
Mulder, are you okay?

34:19.935 --> 34:22.271
It's more comfortable than a futon.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.190
Hey! Look what I caught.

34:25.274 --> 34:26.440
Ouch!

35:02.394 --> 35:04.479
What the hell...?

35:07.733 --> 35:09.651
No!

35:09.735 --> 35:11.904
Nooo!

35:11.987 --> 35:14.489
Nooo!

35:19.286 --> 35:23.790
This has all the makings of those mistaken-
identity miscarriage-of-justice things...

35:23.874 --> 35:26.084
...that prove so popular on 60 Minutes.

35:26.668 --> 35:31.173
- Is this yours?
- The Fifth Amendment says...

35:34.885 --> 35:38.263
- What is that?
- It's Lanny in the drunk tank.

35:38.347 --> 35:41.058
He'll be all right once he sleeps it off.

35:41.141 --> 35:44.228
No, I don't think
he's gonna sleep this one off.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.529
There's been another attack.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.948
How could anyone have gotten in there?

35:56.031 --> 35:58.575
No one got in. But someone got out.

35:58.659 --> 36:01.370
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not sure myself.

36:01.453 --> 36:03.872
But we'll know more when we find Leonard.

36:03.956 --> 36:08.001
- Leonard?
- Lanny's brother.

36:18.345 --> 36:21.181
Oh, God, they extracted the twin.

36:21.265 --> 36:24.017
No. The twin extracted itself.

36:24.101 --> 36:27.312
- But it's an appendage.
- Yeah. Mulder...

36:27.396 --> 36:32.943
This wound is identical to the other victim's -
with one exception. He's not bleeding.

36:33.318 --> 36:38.574
If you're trying to tell me his twin can crawl
out of his body, you're as drunk as he is.

36:39.241 --> 36:42.911
You said it yourself, Sheriff:
it's what's inside that counts.

36:42.995 --> 36:48.542
I suspect that Lanny has an internal anomaly
that allows his conjoining twin to disjoin.

36:48.876 --> 36:51.420
But how? How...

36:51.545 --> 36:54.965
How could I turn him in
without turning myself in?

36:56.258 --> 36:58.927
Lanny, why does he attack other people?

36:59.636 --> 37:02.431
I don't think he knows he's harming anyone.

37:04.433 --> 37:06.518
He is merely seeking...

37:07.352 --> 37:09.438
...another brother.

37:12.566 --> 37:15.194
Are you in pain, Lanny?

37:16.945 --> 37:18.947
It hurts.

37:19.031 --> 37:21.116
It hurts not to be wanted.

37:24.912 --> 37:27.039
I don't know why he hates me so.

37:29.041 --> 37:32.544
I've taken care of him for all of our lives.

37:35.964 --> 37:38.550
Maybe that is the reason why.

37:39.426 --> 37:42.596
How long can he survive
outside of your body?

37:42.679 --> 37:44.765
Long enough...

37:45.974 --> 37:49.937
...to understand that you cannot change
the way you were born.

37:54.483 --> 37:56.693
Don't worry.

37:56.777 --> 37:59.321
He'll come back.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.490
He always does.

38:03.242 --> 38:05.536
I'm still his only brother.

38:06.745 --> 38:09.540
Sheriff, we're gonna need the paramedics.

38:12.125 --> 38:15.712
Scully, you're the medical expert
and you say the twin can disengage.

38:15.796 --> 38:18.465
But how mobile could such a thing be?

38:23.971 --> 38:26.056
Too mobile.

38:31.353 --> 38:33.772
So your twin can, uh...

38:34.690 --> 38:36.316
And then...

38:38.068 --> 38:39.319
What an act!

38:52.207 --> 38:54.293
I'll cover the back.

39:56.063 --> 39:58.565
Freeze!

40:07.699 --> 40:09.826
The fun house.

40:59.543 --> 41:01.628
I thought I heard a shot fired.

41:02.379 --> 41:06.175
I think we'd better go outside
and catch this thing coming out.

41:22.399 --> 41:24.484
It's the manager's dog.

41:25.027 --> 41:27.112
The trailer park.

42:02.564 --> 42:05.442
- Are you all right?
- Have you seen a... uh...

42:05.526 --> 42:07.694
Uh...

42:19.248 --> 42:23.126
Check out the area behind that trailer
and let me know what you find.

42:23.210 --> 42:24.503
All right.

42:24.586 --> 42:27.047
You're sure it was the twin you saw here?

42:27.130 --> 42:29.216
Maybe it was the Fiji Mermaid...

42:29.299 --> 42:32.386
...and he jumped back in the river
and swam back to Fiji.

42:32.469 --> 42:34.555
Now you know how I feel.

42:46.233 --> 42:49.945
- You're takin' off?
- Are you kidding? With that on the loose?

42:50.028 --> 42:54.199
They've been searching for it all day.
It can't have survived for this long.

42:54.283 --> 42:57.452
It'll probably try to crawl
back up into its brother.

42:57.536 --> 43:02.291
No, his brother Lanny died last night.
I performed the autopsy on him this morning.

43:02.374 --> 43:05.085
So I guess it's true
you can never go home again!

43:05.169 --> 43:07.296
His body wounds were nonfatal.

43:08.088 --> 43:11.008
He died as a result
of advanced cirrhosis of the liver.

43:11.091 --> 43:14.970
Oh, there's a moral to this story!
"Lay off the booze."

43:16.180 --> 43:19.433
Well, his body possesses
some anatomical discrepancies.

43:19.516 --> 43:24.271
Offshoots of the oesophagus and trachea
that almost seem umbilical in nature. I...

43:25.772 --> 43:29.193
- I've never seen anything like it.
- And you never will again.

43:29.276 --> 43:31.361
21st-century genetic engineering...

43:31.445 --> 43:34.573
...will eradicate Siamese twins
and alligator people.

43:34.656 --> 43:39.161
You'll even be hard-pressed to find
a slight overbite or a not-so-high cheekbone.

43:39.244 --> 43:43.081

I don't either. It's a mystery.

44:02.351 --> 44:05.562
Maybe some mysteries
are never meant to be solved.

44:11.527 --> 44:15.280
- What's the matter with your friend?
- I don't know what his problem is.

44:15.364 --> 44:18.867
- Maybe it's the Florida heat.
