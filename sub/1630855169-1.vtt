WEBVTT

01:18.875 --> 01:19.375
Russ?

01:19.375 --> 01:20.917
Come in, Russ.

01:20.917 --> 01:24.542
Russ, you got to
get back here now.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.208
What?

01:26.208 --> 01:27.542
I'm on break.

01:27.542 --> 01:28.292
That was an order.

01:28.292 --> 01:29.458
We need help.

01:29.458 --> 01:30.250
There's been a--

01:30.792 --> 01:31.292
Where?

01:34.500 --> 01:35.208
God damn.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.625
Hey, guys, enclosure
10 looks fine.

01:51.625 --> 01:52.833
False alarm.

01:52.833 --> 01:55.667
I'm going back for
my ciggie break.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.542
Are you sending backup?

02:03.542 --> 02:04.375
I'm out here alone.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.417
If you me to go in there,
you better send backup.

02:12.417 --> 02:13.083
Send it now.

02:19.292 --> 02:20.083
I'll check it out.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.250
I'll check it out.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.250
Get over here quickly.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.333
Guys?

03:04.333 --> 03:05.708
Guys?

03:05.708 --> 03:07.500
Don't cut out on me now.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.250
Oh, come on.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.000
This is not a good time.

03:11.000 --> 03:11.542
Come on.

03:16.375 --> 03:17.250
Fuck my life.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.500
I don't even want to find
what I'm looking for.

04:22.958 --> 04:23.542
What the?

04:30.250 --> 04:33.375
Play nice.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.333
Play nice.

05:15.292 --> 05:17.750
What's wrong with you people?

05:17.750 --> 05:18.583
Bunch of savages.

05:26.542 --> 05:29.542
Next slide, please.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.750
These are the types of
species Darrow Industries is

05:31.750 --> 05:34.333
interested in at the moment.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.875
For what exactly, Mr. Smith?

05:37.875 --> 05:40.042
Pay attention, John.

05:40.042 --> 05:42.750
As you know, these mammals are
almost genetically identical

05:42.750 --> 05:46.500
to us, yet they retain
vastly superior senses

05:46.500 --> 05:48.000
and physical prowess.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.792
If we can somehow access
those specific genomes

05:50.792 --> 05:53.500
and harness them,
well, we may be

05:53.500 --> 05:58.375
able to usher in a whole
new era of human evolution.

05:58.375 --> 06:02.667
That sounds interesting.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.000
Our competitors have been
using these types of animals

06:05.000 --> 06:07.708
for years, and it's
time for Darrow

06:07.708 --> 06:10.583
to show what we can really do.

06:10.583 --> 06:13.708
And what exactly do
you want from me?

06:13.708 --> 06:16.250
You'll be analyzing
the data of course.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.500
I want you to head up the
team on this one, John.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.167
You've been with us a while now,
and I think we can trust you.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.042
Well, thank you, sir.

06:24.042 --> 06:26.708
I appreciate that.

06:26.708 --> 06:30.542
Will I be out in the field
with the specimen themselves?

06:30.542 --> 06:34.292
No, that's done in a
more remote facility.

06:34.292 --> 06:35.875
Far too dangerous
for a research team.

06:35.875 --> 06:39.583
But whatever you discover, well,
it could be invaluable to us

06:39.583 --> 06:41.750
in the next stage
of development.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.583
Next stage?

06:43.583 --> 06:47.583
Afraid that's above
your pay grade for now.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.375
Understood.

06:52.917 --> 06:56.667
Believing they can
change the world.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.875
Pathetic, isn't it?

07:03.208 --> 07:05.583
Pathetic is right, sir.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.958
We have veered off the path.

07:07.958 --> 07:13.708
But this, this project is
key to getting us back.

07:13.708 --> 07:15.125
Where are my manners?

07:15.125 --> 07:16.875
I've kept you long enough.

07:16.875 --> 07:17.833
Go on.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.458
Go and see that lovely
girlfriend of yours.

07:22.708 --> 07:23.958
Take her out for a nice meal.

07:23.958 --> 07:27.958
And tomorrow, you're going
to be one very busy man.

07:27.958 --> 07:28.667
Thank you, sir.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.250
Hey, get everyone ready.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.500
It's happening tonight.

07:58.708 --> 08:01.042
Take this road and follow
it to this point here.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.292
That's as far as
you can go by car.

08:02.292 --> 08:04.333
The rest of the way will
have to be made on foot.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.917
Take only what you
need because it's

08:05.917 --> 08:07.542
going to be dark and dangerous.

08:07.542 --> 08:08.125
OK?

08:08.125 --> 08:09.125
Follow this path down.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.375
It leads us to the back
door of the facility.

08:11.375 --> 08:14.250
Then we find a way in and
locate the captive animals.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.375
And this is where we set up
the camera and film everything

08:17.375 --> 08:18.500
that we can.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.833
What kind of resistance
are we facing?

08:20.833 --> 08:24.833
We are looking at a handful
of heavily armed soldiers.

08:24.833 --> 08:25.667
A handful?

08:25.667 --> 08:27.500
Mhm.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.167
Any plans to get
around said handful?

08:30.167 --> 08:32.000
If we follow the path
I've got mapped out,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.917
we should be able to
bypass them completely.

08:33.917 --> 08:36.000
But once we're
inside, we have to be

08:36.000 --> 08:40.333
smart and quick and quiet, Andy.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.667
So are we were sure about this?

08:44.500 --> 08:47.875
Look, you've all
known me for a while.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.083
I'm not going to lie to you.

08:49.083 --> 08:52.250
There's a large risk element.

08:52.250 --> 08:56.542
But I've been working for
Darrow for five years.

08:56.542 --> 08:59.000
That is a long time
to be Smith's lap dog.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.167
And from what I've heard
and from what I've seen,

09:01.167 --> 09:04.167
there is some truly horrible
stuff going on there--

09:04.167 --> 09:07.208
and not just animal abuse.

09:07.208 --> 09:10.542
There is a possibility
of something worse.

09:10.542 --> 09:11.042
Like what?

09:15.500 --> 09:19.792
All these people have gone
missing in the last 12 months.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.208
There's flyers everywhere.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.583
You think there's a connection?

09:26.583 --> 09:27.583
I don't know.

09:27.583 --> 09:31.375
But they were all last
seen in this area here.

09:31.375 --> 09:32.292
What?

09:32.292 --> 09:33.583
And you just want us
to go walking right

09:33.583 --> 09:35.417
into this Bermuda Triangle?

09:35.417 --> 09:38.750
Maybe they got lost in the woods
or maybe they saw something

09:38.750 --> 09:39.875
that they shouldn't have.

09:39.875 --> 09:43.083
But we need to find out
what is going on here.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.917
We owe it to them.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.625
We go in.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.917
We get our footage.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.125
We get out.

09:48.125 --> 09:52.000
And then we show
everyone what we found.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.500
You think this is really
going to change anything?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.583
You're a ray of sunshine,
you know that, Pete?

09:56.583 --> 09:58.542
What they're doing
isn't just illegal.

09:58.542 --> 09:59.542
It's inhumane.

09:59.542 --> 10:02.917
So yeah, if we get
footage, they're finished.

10:02.917 --> 10:05.042
And then maybe the
next company that

10:05.042 --> 10:09.042
decides to torture helpless
wildlife for corporate gain

10:09.042 --> 10:10.375
will think twice about it.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.917
OK, I'm in.

10:15.917 --> 10:16.958
Yeah, fuck it.

10:16.958 --> 10:17.458
Me too.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.875
Me three.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.708
OK, well, get your gear.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.625
Get some rest.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.792
We'll leave tomorrow at 7:00.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.292
Get ready to change the world.

10:32.708 --> 10:33.500
Who wants pizza?

10:33.500 --> 10:34.125
Me.

10:34.125 --> 10:34.917
Yes.

10:34.917 --> 10:35.500
Yes.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.583
And a beer.

10:50.833 --> 10:51.750
What was that for?

10:54.708 --> 10:57.708
I am so proud of you.

10:57.708 --> 10:59.417
You mean us?

10:59.417 --> 11:03.750
Well, yeah, but this has
been an idea for so long.

11:03.750 --> 11:07.333
And it is finally
happening because of you.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.083
And I couldn't done any
of this without you.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.667
I don't even think I could
get up in the morning

11:12.667 --> 11:15.000
if I didn't have you
next to me to wake up to.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.333
That is not true.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.333
Yeah.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.833
Thank you.

11:19.833 --> 11:26.000
And thank you for coming on this
super secret mission with me.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.500
Oh, I like the sound of that.

11:31.708 --> 11:32.875
Promise me something.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.333
Anything for you.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.000
Good answer.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.417
If anything happens,
you have to promise me

11:40.417 --> 11:44.083
that you will finish
what we started.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.083
Come here.

11:48.083 --> 11:48.875
Oh, ow.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.708
Oh, my God.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.042
I stubbed my toe.

11:52.042 --> 11:52.708
Just breathe.

11:52.708 --> 11:53.333
It'll heal.

11:53.333 --> 11:56.208
Oh, thank you, doctor.

12:07.833 --> 12:08.958
Are we here?

12:08.958 --> 12:09.625
Yeah.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.208
It's about a click up ahead.

12:12.208 --> 12:13.708
Was a click?

12:13.708 --> 12:15.583
Really, Pete?

12:15.583 --> 12:16.417
We're almost there.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.375
I have a bad feeling about this.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.083
Hey, it's going to be OK.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.917
What if something happens to us?

12:26.917 --> 12:29.500
I mean, nobody even knows
that we're out here.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.625
Hey, remember why
we're doing this.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.083
She is right.

12:35.083 --> 12:41.125
What we're doing is illegal
and stupid and crazy.

12:41.125 --> 12:43.708
You're not helping things.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.083
Hold my hand.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.583
As long as you're
holding my hand,

12:46.583 --> 12:49.375
nothing bad is
going to happen, OK?

12:49.375 --> 12:50.708
OK.

12:50.708 --> 12:52.792
Thanks, Andy.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.542
Are all these bases in
the middle of nowhere?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.750
That's why they're called
a secret base, Pete.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.542
I'm starting to think
I don't want to know

12:59.542 --> 13:01.417
what they're keeping a secret.

13:01.417 --> 13:02.792
OK, let's get the gear, huh?

13:09.833 --> 13:11.458
It's the border of
the compound, guys.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.042
So from here on out,
we're in Darrow territory,

13:14.042 --> 13:15.667
so we got to be as
quiet as possible.

13:15.667 --> 13:16.500
As mice.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.042
Yeah, make sure you
bring everything

13:18.042 --> 13:21.917
with you because once we
leave, we are not coming back.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.333
That's reassuring.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.667
Phones in the trunk.

13:24.667 --> 13:25.958
Sorry, what?

13:25.958 --> 13:26.958
Darrow has new tech.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.792
They can track phones
even when they're off,

13:28.792 --> 13:30.417
so phones in the trunk.

13:30.417 --> 13:31.542
That's ridiculous.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.333
We're not going to
just walk in there

13:33.333 --> 13:35.833
without any way of calling
for help if we need it.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.375
Come on.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.167
No, I'm being serious.

13:39.167 --> 13:40.250
This is dangerous.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.667
He's going to get us all killed.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.417
Look, Faith, this
is the job, OK?

13:43.417 --> 13:44.875
I get it if you
want to stay here,

13:44.875 --> 13:46.167
but I'm not driving you back.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.083
Fine.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.750
All right.

14:03.208 --> 14:04.708
After this jog,
the facility better

14:04.708 --> 14:06.417
have central heat
because I'm freezing.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.208
Andy, Andy, Andy, keep it down.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.875
Yeah.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.542
Is there anything out here?

14:20.042 --> 14:21.750
What the hell?

14:21.750 --> 14:25.208
What's wrong?

14:25.208 --> 14:25.750
What is it?

14:30.167 --> 14:31.292
Animal tracks.

14:31.292 --> 14:33.833
They don't belong to an
animal I've ever seen before.

14:33.833 --> 14:37.208
And they're too big to be human.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.000
Kind of looks like--

14:39.000 --> 14:40.042
What?

14:40.042 --> 14:42.542
What, you think it's
like a bear or something?

14:42.542 --> 14:46.667
Bears don't have toes.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.208
We should follow them.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.208
You're just full of great
ideas today, aren't you?

14:51.208 --> 14:54.208
If it's escaped, it
might be hurt, so.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.958
But we're headed in the same
direction as the tracks anyway.

14:56.958 --> 14:57.875
We should keep going.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.917
Well, the track ends here.

15:10.917 --> 15:12.583
Oh, well.

15:12.583 --> 15:13.583
This is it.

15:13.583 --> 15:14.500
This is the entrance.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.875
Kind of looks like a cave.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.333
How stupid.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.458
So how do you get through?

15:27.458 --> 15:29.042
I'm going to have
to pick that lock.

15:29.042 --> 15:30.250
I've got a kit.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.292
This area looks clear.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.292
Should we check it out?

15:32.292 --> 15:32.833
Yeah.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.583
I can't see shit here.

16:14.583 --> 16:17.000
Has anyone got any water?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
I've got some.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.583
Hey, where are you going?

16:31.583 --> 16:33.667
Nature calls.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.625
Come on, dude.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.208
It already smells
like a sewer in here.

16:36.208 --> 16:37.208
Not my problem.

16:49.500 --> 16:55.542
New, optics, night vision.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.417
Did anyone hear that?

17:54.417 --> 17:57.083
It's probably just
Pete finishing.

17:57.083 --> 17:57.583
Pete?

18:08.708 --> 18:10.417
Pete?

18:10.417 --> 18:13.750
Pete, if you're messing
around, cut it out.

18:16.667 --> 18:17.583
You getting anything?

18:17.583 --> 18:19.667
I can't see him.

18:19.667 --> 18:20.167
Wait.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.000
Something at the
end of the hall.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.958
Is it him?

18:27.958 --> 18:32.083
What the hell is that?

18:35.667 --> 18:37.167
Oh my god!

18:37.167 --> 18:39.250
Oh my god!

18:39.250 --> 18:40.250
Go!

18:40.250 --> 18:40.792
Go!

18:51.583 --> 18:52.625
Oh, god!

18:58.833 --> 19:02.208
Was that a fucking monkey?

19:02.208 --> 19:02.708
Run!

19:02.708 --> 19:03.250
Run!

19:03.250 --> 19:03.750
Run!

19:17.208 --> 19:18.250
Do you see anything?

19:40.333 --> 19:44.833
Slowly crouch down.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.292
Make yourself small.

19:48.875 --> 19:52.000
Elena!

20:10.542 --> 20:11.542
We're nearly there.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.208
We're nearly there.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.333
You're not going to die.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.833
You're not going to die.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.042
Is there anyone in there?

20:17.042 --> 20:17.542
Who cares?

20:17.542 --> 20:18.375
Get inside.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.375
Get inside.

20:28.042 --> 20:32.750
What are we doing now?

20:32.750 --> 20:35.083
What the fuck are
we going to do now?

20:35.083 --> 20:36.750
You can calm down for one.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.667
Don't you fucking
tell me to calm down.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.833
That thing just killed Pete.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.083
Are you OK?

20:42.083 --> 20:42.750
I'll be fine.

20:42.750 --> 20:43.917
OK, just hold on, all right?

20:43.917 --> 20:45.000
Hello?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.500
I'm trying to yell at you here.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.750
What the hell are
we doing, John?

20:48.750 --> 20:50.167
I'm just trying
to find something

20:50.167 --> 20:51.417
to clean her wound, OK?

20:56.125 --> 20:56.833
It's fine.

20:56.833 --> 20:58.667
I don't think he followed us.

20:58.667 --> 21:00.333
I don't think.

21:00.333 --> 21:03.458
OK, El, it's going
to burn a bit, OK?

21:13.250 --> 21:15.500
If that thing hears us,
we're all going to be dead.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.167
She's in pain, OK, Faith?

21:22.167 --> 21:23.000
It's OK.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.167
Just keep some
pressure on it, OK?

21:28.792 --> 21:31.250
I need you both to
calm the fuck down, OK?

21:31.250 --> 21:32.125
I'm calm.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.125
I swear to God.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.042
That wound is bad.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.667
We need to get her
to a hospital ASAP.

21:35.667 --> 21:36.333
OK.

21:36.333 --> 21:36.917
OK.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.500
So what are we doing?

21:38.500 --> 21:40.083
Call the play.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.583
What about that?

21:41.583 --> 21:42.208
The radio?

21:42.208 --> 21:43.375
Does it even work?

21:43.375 --> 21:45.250
I don't know, but
we've got to try.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.792
No, not good enough.

21:46.792 --> 21:49.042
It's her best shot.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.708
And what about us, John?

21:50.708 --> 21:53.208
I mean, you put a call
out on that thing,

21:53.208 --> 21:56.250
and Darrow is going to come
down on us like a nuclear bomb.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.542
I mean, we are in real
fucking shit here--

21:58.542 --> 22:01.375
like never-heard-from-again
shit.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.167
You're right.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.583
But we can't just leave her
in the middle of the woods,

22:05.583 --> 22:06.500
can we?

22:06.500 --> 22:09.667
Not with that thing
still out there.

22:09.667 --> 22:13.333
That thing just
killed our friend.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.000
And that was on you.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.042
This is all your
fault. You led us here.

22:18.042 --> 22:19.375
You put him in that position.

22:19.375 --> 22:21.667
I don't think you get to
call the shots anymore, OK?

22:21.667 --> 22:23.083
We are not making that call.

22:23.083 --> 22:26.375
Faith, just--

22:26.375 --> 22:29.458
I am.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.875
Fine, you do that.

22:30.875 --> 22:33.667
And then you three, you can just
sit around and wait for someone

22:33.667 --> 22:36.042
to come along and arrest
you for trespassing.

22:36.042 --> 22:37.833
But I-- I am making
a run for it.

22:37.833 --> 22:39.083
No.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.042
No, that is the worst thing that
any of us could do right now.

22:41.042 --> 22:42.750
Worse than calling
whoever the hell is

22:42.750 --> 22:44.417
on the end of that radio?

22:44.417 --> 22:47.042
OK, OK, we need to calm down
and be smart about this.

22:47.042 --> 22:49.500
We don't know who's on the
radio, so we don't know what

22:49.500 --> 22:51.250
they're going to do to us when
they find out that we were

22:51.250 --> 22:54.042
trespassing, much less when they
find out what we were actually

22:54.042 --> 22:54.875
trying to do.

22:54.875 --> 22:55.917
OK, what do you suggest?

23:00.375 --> 23:02.958
I'll make a run for it,
try and get to the city.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.000
What?

23:04.000 --> 23:04.542
No.

23:04.542 --> 23:05.958
No, that's crazy.

23:05.958 --> 23:08.708
If I can make it to the city, I
can come back with the cavalry.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.042
And it won't matter what
they do when they arrest you.

23:11.042 --> 23:12.042
They can't do anything.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.208
They'll never believe you.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.708
I think they will
when I show them this.

23:20.708 --> 23:22.542
So what do we do?

23:22.542 --> 23:24.083
Sit tight.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.250
Don't move from here.

23:28.083 --> 23:31.042
And when you get in
contact, feed them a lie.

23:31.042 --> 23:32.292
Anything.

23:32.292 --> 23:34.917
Tell them that we were hiking
and that we got lost-- anything

23:34.917 --> 23:36.792
but what we were
actually trying to do.

23:36.792 --> 23:37.083
Yeah.

23:37.083 --> 23:37.625
OK.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.000
When they show up, we--

23:39.000 --> 23:40.875
we all just do the same story--

23:40.875 --> 23:41.667
dumb and innocent.

23:41.667 --> 23:42.167
Yeah.

23:45.875 --> 23:46.375
OK.

23:46.375 --> 23:47.375
This is insane.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.917
This has got to see
the outside world.

23:49.917 --> 23:52.125
You know I shouldn't
let you do this, right?

23:52.125 --> 23:54.958
That thing is still out there.

23:54.958 --> 23:57.375
Yeah.

23:57.375 --> 23:59.583
I mean, who else is going to go?

23:59.583 --> 24:01.958
Well, I'm not about to
let her try and run this.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.792
And you need to stay
here and play medic.

24:09.125 --> 24:09.625
OK.

24:19.875 --> 24:20.875
What about the monster?

24:23.708 --> 24:25.667
I mean, Andy, if you
go out, there you're

24:25.667 --> 24:26.542
going to get killed.

24:26.542 --> 24:29.375
No, no, don't think like that.

24:35.792 --> 24:43.000
Just please, promise
me you'll come back.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I always do, don't I?

24:51.667 --> 24:53.042
Wait here.

24:53.042 --> 24:54.167
Stay safe.

24:54.167 --> 24:56.542
Fix the damn radio.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.833
Lock the door after I've left.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.500
Wish me luck.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.042
Good luck.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.333
What are you doing?

25:16.333 --> 25:20.000
I'm just going to get
a quick message out.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.958
Hey, just rest, OK?

25:28.833 --> 25:29.375
Come in.

25:29.375 --> 25:29.917
Come in.

25:29.917 --> 25:30.542
Does anybody read me.

25:30.542 --> 25:31.583
Over.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.708
Does anybody copy?

25:32.708 --> 25:33.208
Over.

25:36.417 --> 25:37.333
This is Fort Marion.

25:37.333 --> 25:38.875
We read you.

25:38.875 --> 25:40.042
What's the situation?

25:40.042 --> 25:41.083
Over.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.750
Please, we-- we were
hiking and got lost.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.500
And something attacked
us in the woods.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.208
And one of us is hurt, and we--
we need medical assistance.

25:48.208 --> 25:48.958
Send someone.

25:48.958 --> 25:50.042
Over.

25:50.042 --> 25:51.500
Hiking?

25:51.500 --> 25:54.208
You realize you're currently
in a restricted area, sir?

25:54.208 --> 25:55.458
What are you doing out here?

25:55.458 --> 25:57.833
Please, you've got
to send someone soon.

25:57.833 --> 25:59.833
Over.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.000
Roger that.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.375
Stand by for pick
up, and stay inside.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.042
Over at out.

26:19.042 --> 26:23.250
Can't see shit, and
you're being stalked

26:23.250 --> 26:27.958
by a giant, killer silverback.

26:27.958 --> 26:31.750
I suppose there are
worse places to be.

26:31.750 --> 26:32.792
Screw it.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.458
I got to go right now.

27:19.708 --> 27:20.250
Fuck!

27:30.167 --> 27:31.208
Shit.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.500
Who is it?

27:58.500 --> 28:00.333
John, who's there?

28:00.333 --> 28:00.875
Hey, it's OK.

28:00.875 --> 28:01.750
They're here to help.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.500
Doesn't sound like it.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.042
Yeah, we're coming.

28:10.042 --> 28:11.042
Down on the floor.

28:11.042 --> 28:12.167
Jesus Christ!

28:12.167 --> 28:13.333
Down on the floor!

28:13.333 --> 28:13.833
Now!

28:13.833 --> 28:14.375
Yes, OK.

28:14.375 --> 28:16.000
Do as they say.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
We called you.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.583
We need you.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.083
Are you the one
who made the call?

28:20.083 --> 28:20.375
Yes.

28:20.375 --> 28:21.208
Yes.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.042
She needs medical
assistance, OK?

28:22.042 --> 28:23.375
She needs to get to a hospital.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.542
Shut the fuck up.

28:25.542 --> 28:26.542
I don't like this.

28:47.542 --> 28:50.208
So glad you could join us.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.167
Where's my girlfriend?

28:53.167 --> 28:56.917
I believe I have
some questions first.

28:56.917 --> 28:59.250
Where is it?

28:59.250 --> 29:00.500
Where's what?

29:00.500 --> 29:03.917
The ape-- my ape.

29:07.542 --> 29:11.000
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.917
What do you think killed
your friends out there?

29:13.917 --> 29:14.917
The thing in the woods?

29:17.625 --> 29:19.750
That's an ape?

29:19.750 --> 29:23.333
I guess ape is
somewhat misleading.

29:23.333 --> 29:26.125
It's actually a gorilla.

29:26.125 --> 29:29.583
More specifically, it's a
genetic creation of ours

29:29.583 --> 29:33.458
and one we intend on retrieving.

29:33.458 --> 29:35.917
Look, I-- I don't know what
you're talking about, OK?

29:35.917 --> 29:38.042
We got lost.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.917
We were hiking.

29:39.917 --> 29:42.083
You thought you get
attacked by a bear?

29:42.083 --> 29:42.625
Yeah.

29:42.625 --> 29:43.208
Yeah.

29:43.208 --> 29:46.333
Yeah, that was later.

29:46.333 --> 29:49.875
You can't even keep your
story straight, can you?

29:49.875 --> 29:54.250
Look, there's no point keeping
up the pretense anymore.

29:54.250 --> 30:00.583
So I ask you again, where is it?

30:00.583 --> 30:01.875
I don't know.

30:01.875 --> 30:04.875
Stop asking me questions
that I can't answer, OK?

30:04.875 --> 30:05.833
We were hiking.

30:05.833 --> 30:06.583
We got lost.

30:06.583 --> 30:07.500
We went to the cabin.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.542
You guys showed up.

30:08.542 --> 30:10.208
Now I'm here.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.250
If it was so
important to you, why

30:12.250 --> 30:14.750
didn't you put a goddamn
tracking device on it?

30:14.750 --> 30:15.708
Tell me this, John--

30:22.042 --> 30:30.667
John Anderson, 34, born in
San Diego, one of three boys.

30:30.667 --> 30:33.833
Parents both deceased.

30:33.833 --> 30:37.833
Graduated with honors.

30:37.833 --> 30:41.375
Criminal record for involvement
in illegal protesting

30:41.375 --> 30:45.375
and several unpaid
parking tickets.

30:45.375 --> 30:50.833
Researcher at Darrow Industries
and co-founder of Antifa eco

30:50.833 --> 30:53.333
terrorist organization--

30:53.333 --> 30:53.875
The Way.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.542
All that sound about right?

31:01.542 --> 31:04.042
We're not terrorists.

31:04.042 --> 31:06.042
We like to do a bit
of background research

31:06.042 --> 31:08.417
on all our employees.

31:08.417 --> 31:13.542
But trust me, that is the
least of your worries.

31:13.542 --> 31:17.542
What I really want to know is
why do you think you're here?

31:22.958 --> 31:24.375
Where's my girlfriend?

31:27.500 --> 31:30.708
I can see you're
not ready to talk.

31:30.708 --> 31:35.708
Maybe some time in isolation
will soften you up a bit.

31:35.708 --> 31:39.208
We don't know anything, OK?

31:39.208 --> 31:42.167
So just-- so why don't
you just let us go?

31:45.083 --> 31:47.917
You're not going anywhere, John.

31:47.917 --> 31:49.750
Don't you get it?

31:49.750 --> 31:52.375
You're not leaving this place.

31:52.375 --> 31:57.083
This is where it ends for you.

31:57.083 --> 32:01.583
Consider it purgatory
on your way to hell.

32:05.875 --> 32:09.208
Hey, colonel, I'll
see you there.

32:43.750 --> 32:48.000
Ah, hello, there.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.458
Miss, Elena, is it?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.958
Let me out of this thing.

32:52.958 --> 32:55.208
I'm afraid I can't do that.

32:55.208 --> 32:58.708
We have too much to do.

32:58.708 --> 33:00.458
What do you want?

33:00.458 --> 33:03.750
I just want to sit
here and watch.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.375
You just want to sit here
and watch me struggle?

33:06.375 --> 33:07.375
You fucking sicko.

33:07.375 --> 33:09.417
No.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.667
Watch you turn.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.083
Turn into what?

33:16.083 --> 33:20.375
You have no idea what
you're part of, do you?

33:20.375 --> 33:23.167
We know what you've
been doing here.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.875
We know that you've been
kidnapping animals and testing

33:26.875 --> 33:30.000
on them and killing them.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
We came here to stop you.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.500
And how did that
work out for you?

33:37.500 --> 33:40.167
All this effort to
stop animal testing,

33:40.167 --> 33:45.042
and now you're the
one being tested on.

33:45.042 --> 33:47.667
Who are you people?

33:47.667 --> 33:52.042
My name is Doctor Kafka, and
I'm here to change the world.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.333
You know what?

34:04.333 --> 34:07.167
We're on a tight
schedule here, and I

34:07.167 --> 34:09.708
don't feel like waiting around.

34:09.708 --> 34:10.375
Are you serious?

34:13.792 --> 34:14.625
Dead serious.

34:17.708 --> 34:21.542
What did you think was going
to happen to you here, John?

34:21.542 --> 34:23.042
We're going to expose you--

34:23.042 --> 34:28.500
everything you're doing
and everything you've done.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.500
You don't even know
what we're doing here.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.417
Do you think it's a
coincidence you ended up

34:34.417 --> 34:37.083
tied to that chair?

34:37.083 --> 34:38.750
What?

34:38.750 --> 34:43.167
We know about your adventures
in veganism after hours.

34:43.167 --> 34:45.292
Why would we keep you around?

34:45.292 --> 34:49.042
Slowly feeding you
information about this place

34:49.042 --> 34:55.208
till you were stupid enough
to actually drive up to it.

34:55.208 --> 34:56.833
It doesn't matter.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.542
We're still going
to find the truth,

34:58.542 --> 35:01.125
and you're still going down.

35:01.125 --> 35:04.250
Oh, you poor boy.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.500
Let me show you how
much shit you're in.

35:10.542 --> 35:14.125
Allow me to enlighten
you, Miss Elena.

35:14.125 --> 35:19.667
Darrow Industries is ushering
in a new age in our evolution.

35:19.667 --> 35:22.333
You see, this country--

35:22.333 --> 35:25.333
hell, this world has grown weak.

35:28.042 --> 35:28.792
Does that hurt?

35:31.708 --> 35:35.375
The only way to move
forward is to go back.

35:35.375 --> 35:39.000
We must return man
to his base instinct

35:39.000 --> 35:43.458
and reclaim our rightful place
as the most dominant species.

35:43.458 --> 35:46.625
And you are going
to help me, Elena.

35:49.833 --> 35:54.375
No, don't go near
me with that thing.

35:54.375 --> 36:01.167
You see this little scratch will
soon transform you, elevate you

36:01.167 --> 36:03.417
to what you should be--

36:03.417 --> 36:05.875
the ultimate predator.

36:05.875 --> 36:09.917
You and I, we are going to
make humanity great again.

36:09.917 --> 36:10.500
No.

36:10.500 --> 36:10.792
No.

36:10.792 --> 36:11.083
Wait.

36:11.083 --> 36:11.375
Wait.

36:11.375 --> 36:11.667
Wait.

36:11.667 --> 36:12.083
Wait.

36:12.083 --> 36:12.708
Please stop.

36:12.708 --> 36:13.667
Just listen to me, please.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.583
We're not weak.

36:15.583 --> 36:17.500
No people-- just because
just-- because we

36:17.500 --> 36:21.042
care about the planet and
people does not make us weak.

36:21.042 --> 36:25.667
It took us thousands of years
of evolution to get here.

36:25.667 --> 36:27.375
Did you-- did you
ever think of that?

36:27.375 --> 36:31.250
That maybe this was
Mother Nature's plan?

36:31.250 --> 36:34.250
I prefer my plan.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.500
What the fuck are we doing here?

37:22.750 --> 37:25.083
I really don't like this.

37:25.083 --> 37:27.833
I really don't
fucking like this.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.708
They come to get in here.

38:22.792 --> 38:23.833
Fire!

38:38.833 --> 38:39.833
Did we get it?

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Open fire!

39:06.083 --> 39:07.583
What the hell is this?

39:24.833 --> 39:25.333
Move.

39:25.333 --> 39:25.875
Move.

39:25.875 --> 39:26.167
Move.

39:26.167 --> 39:26.458
Move.

39:26.458 --> 39:26.875
Move.

39:30.542 --> 39:31.333
Move it, Sergeant!

39:31.333 --> 39:31.875
Move it!

39:31.875 --> 39:32.750
Move it!

40:09.833 --> 40:10.333
Now!

40:10.333 --> 40:10.875
Now!

40:18.625 --> 40:20.958
Colonel, Colonel,
stand by for now.

40:20.958 --> 40:23.333
We're under attack.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.333
Deal with it.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.042
Oh, shit.

41:21.833 --> 41:24.583
Come in, Private.

41:24.583 --> 41:28.083
Do any of you read me?

41:28.083 --> 41:29.042
They're dead, Colonel.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.333
You did this.

41:33.333 --> 41:35.542
No.

41:35.542 --> 41:37.083
Your pet did.

41:37.083 --> 41:37.750
Who are you?

41:37.750 --> 41:38.250
Fuck.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.333
Cock sucker.

42:09.375 --> 42:09.917
No!

42:34.708 --> 42:37.792
What is happening to me?

42:37.792 --> 42:41.458
You are becoming more.

42:41.458 --> 42:43.042
Like the thing in the woods?

42:43.042 --> 42:45.042
It's Kira.

42:45.042 --> 42:48.417
She's our most promising
subject so far.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.167
I don't-- I don't want this.

42:50.167 --> 42:51.667
Oh, don't say that.

42:51.667 --> 42:52.667
I don't want this.

42:52.667 --> 42:53.750
Reverse it!

42:53.750 --> 42:56.167
I can't do that.

42:56.167 --> 42:57.667
You're lying.

42:57.667 --> 43:00.708
Fix it!

43:00.708 --> 43:03.417
There's no going back.

43:03.417 --> 43:10.083
We are evolving whether
you like it or not.

43:12.167 --> 43:13.708
She's come home.

43:45.292 --> 43:47.542
My beautiful creation.

44:07.458 --> 44:08.542
Come on.

44:08.542 --> 44:10.667
Get up!

44:10.667 --> 44:11.833
See?

44:11.833 --> 44:13.583
This is what your
tree-hugging pussies

44:13.583 --> 44:16.250
get going around telling
everyone what they

44:16.250 --> 44:18.083
can and can't do all the time.

44:18.083 --> 44:22.583
I'm guessing you take
whole milk in your coffee.

44:22.583 --> 44:24.000
Shut up, boy.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.750
And take your
beating like a man.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.042
Do what you want.

44:27.042 --> 44:29.542
I'm still going
to ruin your day.

44:33.375 --> 44:34.333
El?

44:34.333 --> 44:36.500
Kira!

44:36.500 --> 44:37.000
Elena?

44:41.042 --> 44:41.708
You!

44:41.708 --> 44:42.542
What the hell are you doing?

44:42.542 --> 44:43.000
Where is she?

44:43.000 --> 44:43.500
Let me go!

44:43.500 --> 44:44.000
Tell me!

44:44.000 --> 44:44.833
Are you crazy?

44:44.833 --> 44:46.000
It's right behind me.

44:53.208 --> 44:54.750
There you are.

45:02.542 --> 45:03.042
John.

45:10.042 --> 45:10.833
We have to go.

45:14.625 --> 45:15.708
I'm sorry, baby girl.

45:20.042 --> 45:20.542
Fuck.

45:39.083 --> 45:39.583
Fuck.

45:47.333 --> 45:47.958
Where's, Faith?

45:47.958 --> 45:48.625
I don't know.

45:48.625 --> 45:51.500
I thought she'd be with you.

45:51.500 --> 45:53.125
Do you know where we're going?

45:53.125 --> 45:53.667
No.

45:53.667 --> 45:54.125
In here.

45:54.125 --> 45:54.625
Come on.

46:04.833 --> 46:06.000
Are you OK?

46:10.083 --> 46:10.667
Your arm?

46:13.750 --> 46:16.167
It looks worse than it feels.

46:16.167 --> 46:17.208
What's happening to you?

46:19.875 --> 46:25.250
I think that doctor
injected me with something.

46:25.250 --> 46:25.792
I'm--

46:28.542 --> 46:29.708
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

46:29.708 --> 46:30.500
El, El, El.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.000
Hey.

46:31.000 --> 46:31.583
Hey.

46:31.583 --> 46:32.292
Hey, what's going on?

46:32.292 --> 46:33.708
What's going on?

46:33.708 --> 46:34.500
Did you hear that?

46:34.500 --> 46:35.667
Hear what?

46:35.667 --> 46:36.708
You don't hear anything?

46:36.708 --> 46:37.833
No, I don't hear anything.

46:40.375 --> 46:42.250
I think that
something's inside me.

46:42.250 --> 46:43.208
OK, OK, OK, OK.

46:43.208 --> 46:44.000
Hey, hey, hey.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.083
Hey, it's OK.

46:45.083 --> 46:45.958
It's OK.

46:45.958 --> 46:48.208
OK, I got you.

46:48.208 --> 46:48.958
I know.

46:48.958 --> 46:52.083
I know, but I'm going to fix it.

46:52.083 --> 46:52.625
I promise.

46:57.167 --> 46:58.167
What?

46:58.167 --> 46:58.833
I don't know.

46:58.833 --> 46:59.500
Are you OK?

46:59.500 --> 47:01.000
Yeah, no, no, no, I'm fine.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
That guy did a--

47:03.000 --> 47:04.042
did a number on the ribs.

47:04.042 --> 47:06.917
That's all.

47:06.917 --> 47:09.917
I'll be fine.

47:09.917 --> 47:13.333
Well, just breathe.

47:13.333 --> 47:15.000
It'll heal.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.583
OK, yeah.

47:16.583 --> 47:17.417
Good advice, right?

47:17.417 --> 47:18.208
Thank you, Doctor.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.500
Where are we?

47:27.542 --> 47:30.167
I don't know.

47:30.167 --> 47:36.500
Elena, I'm sorry.

47:36.500 --> 47:39.042
For what?

47:39.042 --> 47:40.417
It's all my fault.

47:40.417 --> 47:41.000
No.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.083
Yeah, Faith was right.

47:42.083 --> 47:44.167
If I listened to everybody,
everybody wouldn't ever

47:44.167 --> 47:45.042
be killed in my view.

47:45.042 --> 47:48.542
No, no, no, this was not you.

47:48.542 --> 47:50.708
This was Darrow.

47:50.708 --> 47:52.708
They are the ones that
created the thing that

47:52.708 --> 47:53.542
killed those people.

47:53.542 --> 47:55.042
It is not on you.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.875
It is not your fault, OK?

47:56.875 --> 48:01.125
OK, but that's not it.

48:01.125 --> 48:02.125
Then what is?

48:02.125 --> 48:03.542
I think I walked us into a trap.

48:07.125 --> 48:11.375
You think they wanted
us to come here?

48:11.375 --> 48:13.792
That's what he said, yeah.

48:13.792 --> 48:15.375
I mean, they had a
whole file on me.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.042
They knew I was the leak.

48:17.042 --> 48:18.667
You've been working
here for years.

48:18.667 --> 48:19.333
I know.

48:19.333 --> 48:20.250
That's what I don't get.

48:20.250 --> 48:21.708
How long have they
been planning this?

48:24.667 --> 48:28.042
We'll figure it out.

48:28.042 --> 48:29.500
How?

48:29.500 --> 48:31.333
Forget answers.

48:31.333 --> 48:34.458
We find just one
bit of evidence,

48:34.458 --> 48:38.583
then this will all
have been worth it.

48:38.583 --> 48:41.417
I don't think we're
getting out here.

48:41.417 --> 48:43.833
Yes, we are.

48:43.833 --> 48:45.875
We're going to make it.

48:45.875 --> 48:49.750
We have to make it, so
we're going to make it.

48:49.750 --> 48:50.250
Say it.

48:53.417 --> 48:54.417
We're going to make it.

48:54.417 --> 48:55.042
Say it.

48:55.042 --> 48:55.542
Say it.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.208
We're going to make it.

49:00.208 --> 49:01.042
Yeah, we are.

49:04.083 --> 49:07.042
Think you can walk?

49:07.042 --> 49:09.667
For you, anything.

49:09.667 --> 49:10.250
Right answer.

49:12.875 --> 49:16.958
All right, any ideas, big man?

49:20.167 --> 49:27.208
1111.

49:27.208 --> 49:28.750
No.

49:28.750 --> 49:33.083
1112.

49:33.083 --> 49:37.500
Hey, my Master Card pin!

49:37.500 --> 49:39.083
Who is my smart boy?

49:39.083 --> 49:40.875
That would be--

49:40.875 --> 49:43.167
OK, your arm is fucked.

49:43.167 --> 49:43.833
Yeah.

49:43.833 --> 49:44.375
Yeah.

50:13.583 --> 50:14.875
I can't see a thing.

50:14.875 --> 50:16.042
My eyes are killing me.

50:18.708 --> 50:20.042
Faith?

50:20.042 --> 50:21.500
Faith.

50:21.500 --> 50:22.958
Hey, Faith.

50:22.958 --> 50:24.375
Faith, wake up.

50:24.375 --> 50:26.042
Hey.

50:26.042 --> 50:28.000
Hey.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.375
I'm so happy to see you guys.

50:30.375 --> 50:33.042
Thank God you're OK.

50:33.042 --> 50:37.042
Hey, did they-- did
they anything to you?

50:37.042 --> 50:41.042
Yeah, they just kept asking
me the same questions

50:41.042 --> 50:42.875
over and over and over and over.

50:42.875 --> 50:44.583
And when I couldn't
answer any more,

50:44.583 --> 50:48.542
they injected something into me.

50:48.542 --> 50:50.375
What was it?

50:50.375 --> 50:51.708
I don't know.

50:51.708 --> 50:55.833
Everything gets kind
of very after that.

50:55.833 --> 50:59.042
I just-- I remember
waking up in this lab.

50:59.042 --> 51:01.333
And everyone was suddenly gone.

51:01.333 --> 51:05.167
Yeah, they-- they evacuated.

51:05.167 --> 51:07.750
The thing from last
night, it's here.

51:07.750 --> 51:10.583
It's in the building?

51:10.583 --> 51:12.708
It's a gorilla.

51:12.708 --> 51:14.583
Yeah, we just saw it.

51:14.583 --> 51:17.167
We just run away from it.

51:17.167 --> 51:17.917
Are you guys OK?

51:20.333 --> 51:20.792
Yeah.

51:20.792 --> 51:21.333
Yeah.

51:21.333 --> 51:22.000
We're fine.

51:24.667 --> 51:25.292
What was that?

51:31.792 --> 51:33.708
Oh, fuck.

51:33.708 --> 51:34.583
Oh, fuck.

51:34.583 --> 51:36.583
How did that happen?

51:36.583 --> 51:37.708
I don't know.

51:37.708 --> 51:40.792
It was that thing that
scratched me the other night.

51:40.792 --> 51:44.292
Now I just feel different.

51:44.292 --> 51:46.958
We really need to
find a way out.

51:46.958 --> 51:48.167
Yeah, we do.

51:48.167 --> 51:49.917
But we're not leaving
here empty handed.

51:49.917 --> 51:51.708
We're in it now, OK?

51:51.708 --> 51:54.417
Now, that is the
lab right there, OK?

51:54.417 --> 51:56.042
I'm sure there's
something inside.

51:56.042 --> 51:56.750
Are you in?

51:59.708 --> 52:01.708
Yeah.

52:01.708 --> 52:03.167
OK.

52:03.167 --> 52:04.458
OK.

52:04.458 --> 52:04.958
Come on.

52:22.083 --> 52:25.958
What were they even
doing down here?

52:25.958 --> 52:26.792
I have one idea.

52:34.500 --> 52:36.167
Oh, my God.

52:36.167 --> 52:37.333
What?

52:37.333 --> 52:39.250
This is one of the
people that went missing.

52:43.667 --> 52:47.333
John, look at this.

52:47.333 --> 52:48.333
That looks important.

52:48.333 --> 52:50.667
It's locked.

52:50.667 --> 52:52.667
It's small.

52:52.667 --> 52:53.250
Is it light?

52:56.500 --> 52:57.167
Smart agency.

52:57.167 --> 52:57.667
Mhm.

53:04.000 --> 53:04.667
Not that smart.

53:14.875 --> 53:15.375
OK.

53:23.042 --> 53:24.833
Department of Defense?

53:24.833 --> 53:26.583
Government contracts?

53:26.583 --> 53:27.500
Yeah.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.708
Bio weapons, battle
armor, chem bombs.

53:29.708 --> 53:32.417
I mean, this is
super-soldier stuff.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.667
And so evil company
does evil stuff.

53:34.667 --> 53:36.125
What's weird about that?

53:36.125 --> 53:39.667
Because we thought they
were doing animal testing.

53:39.667 --> 53:40.333
They're not.

53:40.333 --> 53:41.375
They're doing human testing.

53:41.375 --> 53:44.875
I mean, so where
are all the animals?

53:44.875 --> 53:47.042
And where are all the people?

53:47.042 --> 53:48.125
Enough of this.

53:48.125 --> 53:51.917
I think we just need to
figure some shit out, OK?

53:51.917 --> 53:53.167
Of course there's a password.

53:58.583 --> 54:00.917
Don't-- don't get us locked out.

54:00.917 --> 54:02.417
Yeah, all right.

54:02.417 --> 54:04.250
Hey, pass me those papers.

54:08.875 --> 54:09.792
The evolution?

54:15.875 --> 54:21.250
All right, OK, there is
a lot of stuff on here.

54:21.250 --> 54:24.000
Try searching test
subjects or Kira.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.958
Try searching Kira.

54:26.958 --> 54:27.458
There.

54:32.833 --> 54:34.708
They're all dead.

54:34.708 --> 54:36.417
What did they do with them?

54:39.417 --> 54:40.583
Let's see.

54:40.583 --> 54:47.917
This one reads Bruce, 48, a
gambler from Soho, London.

54:47.917 --> 54:51.125
Keep going.

54:51.125 --> 54:55.583
Brian, 36, a drug addict.

54:55.583 --> 54:58.750
Diane, 28, an alcoholic.

54:58.750 --> 55:03.625
Freddy, 31, homeless,
no background--

55:06.250 --> 55:07.833
perfect candidate.

55:07.833 --> 55:08.917
What does that even mean?

55:12.708 --> 55:17.667
Here, look, Kira, a
prostitute from Brighton.

55:17.667 --> 55:20.917
She was 23.

55:20.917 --> 55:24.583
She was just a fucking kid.

55:24.583 --> 55:25.542
So why them?

55:28.375 --> 55:30.833
I can't look at this anymore.

55:30.833 --> 55:33.000
No one was going to
come looking for them.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.375
Police are hardly going to bend
over backwards for a missing

55:39.375 --> 55:40.833
prostitute, are they?

55:40.833 --> 55:47.042
OK, so that thing, she
used to be a person, yeah?

55:47.042 --> 55:48.708
They were brought
in as subjects.

55:48.708 --> 55:50.625
But why us?

55:50.625 --> 55:51.542
This shit's different.

55:51.542 --> 55:52.333
It's got to be.

55:52.333 --> 55:54.000
It's got to be the way, right?

55:54.000 --> 55:55.500
I mean, he had a
whole file on me.

55:55.500 --> 55:58.042
And we were protesting outside
their building giving them

55:58.042 --> 56:00.083
all that bad press.

56:00.083 --> 56:03.333
They get rid of us, they
get rid of the movement.

56:03.333 --> 56:05.375
Two birds, one stone.

56:05.375 --> 56:07.333
Fuck.

56:07.333 --> 56:09.500
Fuck, I'm so fucking stupid.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.167
No one could have
seen this coming.

56:11.167 --> 56:12.917
This is what Smith
was talking about, OK?

56:12.917 --> 56:15.750
Fusing primate and human DNA
trying to make some kind of--

56:15.750 --> 56:17.583
Monster.

56:17.583 --> 56:18.167
No.

56:18.167 --> 56:19.042
Super soldier, OK?

56:19.042 --> 56:22.458
And it's not going
to happen to you.

56:22.458 --> 56:23.375
It's already happened.

56:27.625 --> 56:31.167
It's going to be OK, yeah?

56:31.167 --> 56:32.375
Hey.

56:32.375 --> 56:33.958
I don't feel so good.

56:33.958 --> 56:35.875
OK, talk to me.

56:35.875 --> 56:37.875
El?

56:37.875 --> 56:38.458
You're OK.

56:38.458 --> 56:39.708
You're all right.

56:39.708 --> 56:40.833
My head.

56:40.833 --> 56:41.333
OK.

56:41.333 --> 56:42.500
OK.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.083
I've got you.

56:43.083 --> 56:43.750
El.

56:43.750 --> 56:44.500
El.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.417
El, stay with me.

56:45.417 --> 56:46.000
El.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.917
El.

56:47.917 --> 56:48.417
Hey, hey.

56:48.417 --> 56:48.917
Hey, hey.

56:48.917 --> 56:49.917
Do something.

56:49.917 --> 56:51.083
I don't know what to do Hey.

56:51.083 --> 56:51.375
El.

56:51.375 --> 56:51.917
El.

56:51.917 --> 56:56.167
Hey, El, stay with me.

56:56.167 --> 56:56.667
El?

56:56.667 --> 56:58.583
El?

56:58.583 --> 56:59.083
Oh my god.

56:59.083 --> 56:59.625
Is she--

56:59.625 --> 57:00.750
No.

57:00.750 --> 57:01.625
No, she's alive.

57:01.625 --> 57:05.917
She's just-- she's
just passed out.

57:05.917 --> 57:07.333
OK.

57:07.333 --> 57:09.000
She's getting worse fast.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.417
We need to get her out of here.

57:11.417 --> 57:12.875
You stay with her.

57:12.875 --> 57:13.417
Why.

57:13.417 --> 57:14.667
Where are you going?

57:14.667 --> 57:18.667
I'm getting us out of
this fucking bunker.

57:18.667 --> 57:19.208
Yeah.

57:19.208 --> 57:20.250
Yeah, OK.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.583
OK, just come back to me.

57:35.292 --> 57:37.875
Oh, fuck.

57:37.875 --> 57:41.500
What the fuck did
you do that for?

57:41.500 --> 57:42.458
I'm sorry.

57:46.542 --> 57:48.083
I need to eat.

57:51.667 --> 57:54.750
Elena?

57:54.750 --> 58:01.375
I feel hungry, and it's
all I can think about.

58:01.375 --> 58:03.000
El, we're friends.

58:03.000 --> 58:07.083
Listen, listen, you need to--
you need to fight this, yeah?

58:07.083 --> 58:09.167
Please.

58:09.167 --> 58:10.708
Just look at me.

58:10.708 --> 58:12.333
Look at me.

58:12.333 --> 58:14.000
You know who I am.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
You know me.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.083
I'm your friend.

58:18.083 --> 58:19.583
I need.

58:23.583 --> 58:26.000
Please, help me.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.333
Who are you?

58:27.333 --> 58:28.542
They called me Zero.

58:28.542 --> 58:29.875
I was the first.

58:29.875 --> 58:30.667
First what?

58:30.667 --> 58:32.250
Subject.

58:32.250 --> 58:33.375
The rest are all gone.

58:33.375 --> 58:34.292
OK, I'm sorry.

58:34.292 --> 58:35.167
I need to go.

58:35.167 --> 58:35.958
I'm sorry.

58:35.958 --> 58:37.000
Help me.

58:37.000 --> 58:37.667
I can't, OK?

58:37.667 --> 58:38.667
I need to find an exit.

58:38.667 --> 58:39.792
My friends--

58:39.792 --> 58:40.625
I know a way out.

58:43.750 --> 58:46.042
You do?

58:46.042 --> 58:46.917
I watched the guards.

58:46.917 --> 58:48.500
I've learned the exits.

58:48.500 --> 58:51.083
OK, tell me.

58:51.083 --> 58:53.208
Take me with you, please.

58:53.208 --> 58:54.208
I'll show you the way.

58:57.083 --> 58:59.333
OK, how?

58:59.333 --> 58:59.833
There.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.500
OK, stay close.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.792
Can you walk, yeah?

59:10.792 --> 59:14.458
You better be right about this.

59:14.458 --> 59:14.958
Faith.

59:19.625 --> 59:21.167
Elena, what the
fuck are you doing?

59:24.500 --> 59:26.083
El, El, El, El, wait.

59:26.083 --> 59:26.667
It's me.

59:26.667 --> 59:27.167
It's John.

59:27.167 --> 59:27.708
It's John.

59:32.333 --> 59:33.708
What did you do?

59:33.708 --> 59:34.208
John?

59:40.125 --> 59:40.708
What happened?

59:44.208 --> 59:44.708
Faith?

59:50.708 --> 59:53.208
I killed her.

59:53.208 --> 59:55.708
You ate her.

59:55.708 --> 59:56.375
Oh my god.

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:03.458
What the fuck do I do now?

01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:04.083
We must go.

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:08.333
I'm so sorry.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.042
I didn't mean to do it.

01:00:10.042 --> 01:00:11.292
It wasn't me.

01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:11.833
OK.

01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:12.417
OK.

01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:13.375
Hey, hey, guess what.

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:14.042
Guess what.

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:15.833
I found a way out.

01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:18.125
Yeah, we can go home.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:21.167
Do you want to go home?

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:22.167
OK.

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:25.583
But I-- I need you
to stand up, OK?

01:00:25.583 --> 01:00:26.583
You can do that.

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:27.417
OK.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:28.250
OK.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.167
Hey, don't look.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:30.708
Don't look.

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:34.292
OK.

01:00:44.042 --> 01:00:44.583
Come on.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.750
Keep going.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.750
Keep going.

01:00:53.833 --> 01:00:56.917
I need help.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:58.000
I've got you.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:02.042
Zero.

01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:04.167
Come on.

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:06.708
How much farther?

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:07.750
How much farther?

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:14.083
What if it happens again?

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:15.917
It's not going to
happen again, OK?

01:01:15.917 --> 01:01:16.917
It's not.

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:24.875
Please.

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:26.000
Please.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.333
Please!

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:29.167
Please!

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:47.250
Oh, John.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.250
Keep going.

01:01:58.542 --> 01:02:00.625
You've got this, all right?

01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:01.667
It's through here?

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:03.208
Follow Zero out.

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:12.375
It's happening again.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:13.083
El?

01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:14.083
El?

01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:15.250
OK, OK.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.708
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
stay with me, yeah?

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:18.750
Just listen to my voice.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:19.417
Fight it.

01:02:19.417 --> 01:02:20.417
Fight it.

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:21.083
You've got this.

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:22.042
Come on.

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:22.583
Come on.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:24.167
Listen to my voice.

01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:25.167
Yeah, that's it.

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.625
Thank you.

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:35.750
Hey, what is it?

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.833
It doesn't matter.

01:02:37.833 --> 01:02:40.250
We have to keep going.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:43.250
Stop.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.750
Kafka.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:48.042
Guys, we need to go.

01:02:48.042 --> 01:02:51.958
I said we were going to
make humanity great again.

01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:56.958
You are not taking
that away from me.

01:02:56.958 --> 01:02:57.917
Rot in hell.

01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:15.042
Kira.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:36.833
Does it hurt?

01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:37.375
No.

01:03:37.375 --> 01:03:38.708
I'll be fine.

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:39.583
Anything I can do?

01:03:42.875 --> 01:03:44.583
How are you doing, Zero?

01:03:44.583 --> 01:03:45.750
Zero?

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:47.167
Got to stay with me, huh?

01:03:47.167 --> 01:03:48.208
Just tired.

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:52.000
Yeah, OK.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:07.792
What's your real name, Zero?

01:04:11.667 --> 01:04:13.333
I can't remember.

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.792
You can't remember
your own name?

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:18.542
Can't remember much.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.542
What did they do to you?

01:04:26.542 --> 01:04:31.708
They took blood, bones.

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:33.875
Put something else.

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:35.417
At first, I felt fine.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:37.875
But it just got worse.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.625
Is that what's going
to happen to me?

01:04:44.625 --> 01:04:45.167
No.

01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:51.458
How did you survive?

01:05:00.667 --> 01:05:05.417
They-- they wouldn't let me die.

01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:08.083
Darrow's going to
pay for it, Zero--

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:09.542
the genetic testing, all of it.

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:10.250
They're finished.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:15.542
El.

01:05:15.542 --> 01:05:16.042
No.

01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:16.917
No.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:18.250
No.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:19.083
What are you doing?

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.917
I need to eat!

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.250
You need to snap out of it!

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.625
No, I can't.

01:05:23.625 --> 01:05:24.792
It's like an addiction.

01:05:24.792 --> 01:05:25.292
I need to.

01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:28.208
El, stop!

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:29.750
Oh, fuck.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:32.250
Zero, are you OK?

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:32.792
Zero?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.458
She's going to
die out there, El.

01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:46.958
What about us?

01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:52.292
Kira.

01:05:52.292 --> 01:05:53.125
She's still coming.

01:05:53.125 --> 01:05:54.083
We have to go.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.000
Hey.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.042
Hey, hey, hey.

01:06:28.042 --> 01:06:28.542
El.

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:29.583
OK, hey, hey, El.

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.583
El, I can see the road.

01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:37.417
I can see the road.

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:37.917
Yeah?

01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:43.500
John.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.250
Yeah, what is it?

01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.667
I can't.

01:06:49.667 --> 01:06:53.000
Yes, you can.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.458
Whatever I have inside
me, it's taking me over.

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:59.000
I can't go on anymore.

01:07:02.042 --> 01:07:05.833
We're almost there, yeah?

01:07:05.833 --> 01:07:06.375
El.

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:07.375
El.

01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:08.333
OK.

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:08.875
El.

01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:09.375
El.

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:10.042
El.

01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:10.583
El.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:11.083
Hey.

01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:35.875
You have to go.

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:38.875
What are you talking about?

01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:43.625
It's not going to stop.

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:47.083
We are so close.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:48.083
We're so close.

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:51.083
We can make it.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:56.083
No, John, you can make it.

01:07:56.083 --> 01:07:57.083
Don't do this.

01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:05.625
It's not going to
stop coming after us.

01:08:05.625 --> 01:08:06.375
We can make it.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:10.333
It doesn't matter where we go.

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:13.042
I can hear it inside my head.

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:14.375
She's talking to me.

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:17.125
I am drawing her to us.

01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:18.208
But I can't.

01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:19.167
I can't.

01:08:19.167 --> 01:08:20.167
I can't just leave you.

01:08:20.167 --> 01:08:23.125
You have to.

01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:24.583
You are not safe.

01:08:27.708 --> 01:08:32.458
And I'm not going to be
myself for much longer.

01:08:32.458 --> 01:08:34.167
I can't go on without you.

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:50.417
I wasn't expecting this.

01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:57.333
This is on you now.

01:08:57.333 --> 01:09:02.917
John, you have to tell them.

01:09:02.917 --> 01:09:07.958
You have to tell them
everything that they did to us.

01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:12.333
You have to tell
everyone for me.

01:09:16.583 --> 01:09:17.667
I love you.

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:17.958
You've ruined my fucking life.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.625
Elena!

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:35.167
Elena!

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:41.875
Hey!

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:43.958
Hey, over here.

01:11:43.958 --> 01:11:45.792
John, what are you doing here?

01:11:45.792 --> 01:11:46.708
You can't be here.

01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:47.625
You can't.

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.292
Kira!

01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:52.792
Kira.

01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:53.292
Kira.

01:11:53.292 --> 01:11:53.792
Kira.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:54.292
Kira.

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:55.208
Kira.

01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:55.708
Kira.

01:11:55.708 --> 01:11:56.375
Kira.

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:58.167
You don't have to do this.

01:11:58.167 --> 01:11:58.708
Kira.

01:11:58.708 --> 01:11:59.833
Kira.

01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:05.000
If you're still in there,
you don't have to do this.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.583
What they did was terrible.

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:09.042
But they don't have to turn
us on each other, Kira.

01:12:31.333 --> 01:12:31.833
El.

01:12:31.833 --> 01:12:32.375
El.

01:12:32.375 --> 01:12:32.833
El.

01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:33.458
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:35.042
Hey, hey, stay with me.

01:12:35.042 --> 01:12:35.958
Stay with me.

01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:37.667
Stay with me, El.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:44.208
Hey.

01:13:57.375 --> 01:13:58.292
I'm so sorry.
