[Meg] I actually like it.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.971
And Danny could do the menu.

20:22.889 --> 20:26.643
- Maybe.
- He's showing interest in that again.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.479
I saw in the invoices
that the food deliveries are up.

20:29.687 --> 20:34.317
Yep. He's changing the menu. He wants
to open the restaurant to the public.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.236
Why are we making changes?

20:39.114 --> 20:40.157
Why not?

20:40.657 --> 20:44.285
Because there's no need.
You're fixing something that isn't broken.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.331
Dad always talked about
consistency here.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.707
Yeah. I know.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.251
I'm not even sure that it works
financially.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.420
I should go over it carefully
with the accountants.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.089
Of course. You should do that.

20:56.173 --> 20:59.176
But I think that if we can
make it work business-wise...

20:59.258 --> 21:02.137
I don't wanna stand
in Danny's way, really.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.722
Sure.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.976
Danny's a big part of the future here.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.270
And I value his opinion.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.525
Of course.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.617
There's a bone in here.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.703
Put it to the side.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.372
That's lazy technique.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.791
Excuse me?

21:32.083 --> 21:33.793
Danny taught me how to fillet a fish.

21:36.838 --> 21:38.089
When was that?

21:38.173 --> 21:40.008
Earlier when I went over
to see Mama Ray.

21:40.217 --> 21:42.343
He's been giving you
cooking lessons?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.388
What's the problem?

21:47.224 --> 21:49.433
Nothing. I'm just surprised.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.936
Why? You guys sent him
to cooking school, didn't you?

21:55.190 --> 21:56.524
[car horn honks]

21:57.525 --> 21:58.985
Gotta go.

21:59.861 --> 22:03.240
Maybe just once that kid
can come to the front door

22:03.322 --> 22:05.533
and knock instead
of honking that damn horn.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.660
No one does that anymore.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.954
Honey. Ah, ah, ah.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.457
- Say goodbye properly.
- Bye.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.626
- [Diana] Love you.
- [John] Hey, hey, hey. Goodbye.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.461
- I love you too.
- [Janey] Bye.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.841
- What's with the attitude?
- She's a teenager.

22:22.259 --> 22:23.634
She's hanging out with Danny?

22:24.802 --> 22:27.931
He taught her how to fillet fish. I don't
think that's considered hanging out.

22:28.139 --> 22:30.600
We talked about this.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.894
I'm not comfortable with it.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.233
- I talked to him.
- Yeah? What did he say?

22:38.858 --> 22:41.652
He gets it. He gets it.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.203
Whatever happened
with that cooking school?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.913
Um...

22:52.289 --> 22:54.040
I don't know. We lent him some money.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.959
We know he's not gonna pay us back.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.086
Okay. I don't care about the money.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.630
I'm wondering if he ever
got a job cooking anything.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.966
I don't know. I don't know.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.802
- Never mentioned it to you?
- Um, no. If he did have a job,

23:05.927 --> 23:09.806
he probably fucked it up. Why would
he mention it? Do you want more wine?

23:10.807 --> 23:12.558
It's good wine.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.232
The fish was very good tonight.

23:21.859 --> 23:25.113
[Diana] You got it, Dave.
See you next year.

23:25.696 --> 23:29.075
Hey, Lily. Can you give these
a clean-up and a good drink?

23:29.159 --> 23:31.535
- This one's got dead leaves on it.
- Mm-hm.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.375
- Hey, Danny.
- Growing heirlooms this year?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.710
Yeah. Just started.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.254
Hey, you got a moment?

23:42.505 --> 23:44.132
Sure.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.301
Look, I just, um...

23:46.968 --> 23:50.013
I just wanna apologize
for my behavior the other night.

23:51.514 --> 23:55.434
- Don't worry about it.
- John and I were very drunk.

23:55.518 --> 24:00.023
I'm not exactly sure what I said,
but I'm sure I was loud

24:00.106 --> 24:03.151
- and probably stayed too long, you know.
- That's fine.

24:04.194 --> 24:05.862
It's fine.

24:07.905 --> 24:08.948
You sure?

24:10.283 --> 24:11.326
Yeah.

24:12.535 --> 24:13.870
Okay.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.372
Thank you.

24:19.167 --> 24:21.294
Hey, thanks.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.715
You know, for coming
to apologize in person.

24:25.923 --> 24:29.260
I believe if you got something to say,
come right out, say it.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.720
Me, too.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.556
Direct is best, you know?
Which is why

24:33.639 --> 24:37.894
if you do have a problem with me again,
just come tell me about it, you know?

24:39.145 --> 24:40.355
I will.

24:40.563 --> 24:44.067
Just say it to my face. Don't fucking
come between me and my brother.

24:46.527 --> 24:47.653
Not a good idea.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.949
[scoffs]

25:09.175 --> 25:12.053
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.722
- You good?
- Yeah.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.849
Is it just you?

25:17.141 --> 25:20.019
Yeah. Yeah. Kids are out.

25:20.686 --> 25:25.400
Whoa, babe. That's a generous pour.
Three fingers?

25:25.483 --> 25:28.152
It was five a little while ago.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.073
Oh...

25:33.491 --> 25:35.243
How was your day?

25:35.910 --> 25:37.828
Oh, my day was interesting.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.622
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.040
Danny came by.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.960
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.922
To apologize.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.342
That's a good thing.

25:51.509 --> 25:52.802
Mm-mm.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.595
Not the way he does it.

25:57.765 --> 26:01.727
And, uh, I called the cooking school.

26:04.814 --> 26:08.985
He went for half a semester
and then left.

26:09.068 --> 26:12.530
So I don't know
what the fuck we paid for.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.865
[sighs]

26:14.949 --> 26:16.075
You called.

26:17.494 --> 26:20.288
- It was two years ago.
- Mm-hm.

26:21.872 --> 26:25.001
Don't you wanna know
what he's been doing since then?

26:31.341 --> 26:33.176
[Danny] Hey. Morning, Joe.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.428
[Joe] I brought a special shipment
for you today.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.891
Only the best.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.937
Ciao.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.682
Yeah. Come in.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.690
You been talking to Mom?

28:54.817 --> 28:57.778
Yeah. I talk to Mom all the time.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.950
Do you have a problem
with my plans?

29:04.619 --> 29:06.870
Well, she asked me to weigh in.

29:07.079 --> 29:11.000
Maybe I haven't been clear,
because I don't need you weighing in.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.586
Okay? I don't need you
putting ideas in Mom's head.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.297
I hardly think I'm the person
putting ideas in her head.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.719
This may sting a little bit.

29:21.927 --> 29:25.348
But, you know, we're done with
the way Dad did things. It's done.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.727
Maybe before you change things, you
should be here longer than a few weeks.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.521
Well, you see. There you go again.

29:31.604 --> 29:35.566
You're bringing conflict into the
situation. I mean, everything's fine.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.110
Mom's happy. I'm happy.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.945
I have an opinion.

29:40.029 --> 29:43.907
If it doesn't agree with your plan, I
can't help it. You're gonna have to deal.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.827
Look. Look. Look at me.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.997
Look at me.

29:50.414 --> 29:53.876
- Please. This is my future.
- It's my future, too.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.838
It's Kevin's and it's John's.
It's all of ours.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.965
This place belongs to all of us.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.765
When you went to law school,
Mom and Dad paid for it, right?

30:07.848 --> 30:10.727
When I went to cooking school,
who fucking paid for it?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.270
Did Mom and Dad pay for it?
No, they didn't.

30:13.354 --> 30:17.024
I had to fucking put my hand out
and fucking beg people.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.235
I did go to law school.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.654
And then I came back.
And I stayed here.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.699
I turned down opportunities
so that I could help Mom and Dad.

30:25.115 --> 30:29.370
Because you're such a good daughter,
right? You're such a fucking liar.

30:33.791 --> 30:35.585
Please leave.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.587

30:39.963 --> 30:41.507

empty for months now.

to find a guy that used to work here.

You recognize him?

Oh, shit.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.106
Yeah. This was his place.

What do you mean, his place?
He owned it?

33:06.569 --> 33:09.196
I don't know who owned it,
but he ran it.

I mean, you know,
I think he was the, uh, head chef?

- You sure about that?
- Yeah. I work right there.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.955
I saw him every day.
He was a nice guy.

33:37.307 --> 33:41.395
Remember when we were talking about
bringing Danny back into the business?

[Kevin] Yeah. I told you
I was fine with it.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.180
You mean what happened after.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.642
I don't know. That's why I'm asking.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.772
Why? What happened after?

34:27.316 --> 34:30.444
- You really don't remember this?
- No, I was 7 years old.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.362
- Yeah.
- I remember Sarah drowned.

34:32.446 --> 34:35.240
- And I remember Dad was devastated.
- Yeah.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.328
- Then Danny got hurt.
- Right.

Yeah, well, that was the story.

Then what happened to him?

- You were there.

here in this kitchen. John was here.

There's no reason to be nervous.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.564
These are simple questions, okay?

36:31.732 --> 36:33.859
I wanna ask about
your brother Danny.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.822
[young Meg] He killed my sister.

36:39.615 --> 36:42.618
[man] Yes. I know about that.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.706
But I'm interested in how your
brother Danny hurt his shoulder.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.127
You know anything about that?

36:53.045 --> 36:56.214
- A car hit him.
- Did you see that?

36:56.757 --> 36:58.216
No.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.219
Then how do you know?

37:03.764 --> 37:05.724
My brother told me.

37:05.808 --> 37:08.685
- Which brother?
- John.

37:33.460 --> 37:34.962
- Beth Mackey?
- Yeah.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.173
John Rayburn.

37:38.841 --> 37:40.467
You guys don't look anything alike.

37:41.218 --> 37:43.637
Oh, we take after different
sides of the family.

37:44.054 --> 37:46.223
How do I know you're his brother?

37:47.557 --> 37:49.267
Yeah.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.561
[clears throat]

37:52.229 --> 37:53.438
How's that?

37:56.817 --> 38:01.071
John Rayburn.
Yeah, he talked about you. Cop brother.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.408
- You mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Why? Is Danny in trouble?

38:05.617 --> 38:08.662
- Not that I know of.
- You trying to get him in trouble?

38:08.871 --> 38:09.997
No.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.666
I'm concerned about him.

38:13.959 --> 38:17.880
I was thinking maybe since you called me
back, you were concerned about him too.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.966
I'm wondering if maybe I could
ask you a few questions, please.

38:21.842 --> 38:24.427
I'd like to know more
about my brother.

38:24.636 --> 38:28.348
My mom's English is, uh, not perfect.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.643
So when Meg mentioned
the groomsmen in seersucker--

38:31.727 --> 38:35.564
[Meg] She thought that I was
talking about a prostitute. [laughs]

38:35.647 --> 38:38.316
- Oh, no.
- Hey, Mama.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.695
We're gonna step out.

38:41.904 --> 38:44.698
Oh, you have someone with you?

38:45.282 --> 38:49.245
- Chelsea. Hey, honey. How are you?
- Hi, Mrs. Rayburn.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.581
- I'm well, thanks.
- [Sally] Good to see you.

38:53.874 --> 38:56.501
- Hey, Meg.
- Hey. How are you?

38:56.585 --> 38:59.004
Hey. You two come join us.
Grab a chair.

38:59.088 --> 39:01.381
Yeah, sure. Why not?
One quick drink.

39:01.464 --> 39:06.803
Oh, Marco, you're about to be a married
man. You can't be flirting like that.

39:06.887 --> 39:12.059
- It's called being a gentleman.
- Oh, is that what it is? Yeah.

39:13.393 --> 39:16.688
I gotta work on that
a little bit. I gotta say,

39:16.772 --> 39:19.482
I'm a little bit intimidated
by this guy. Look at you, man.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.943
[kisses twice]

39:21.110 --> 39:22.778
[Marco] Hey, hey, hey.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.197
[Danny] I can't believe I'm gonna
be related to this guy.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.075
- I mean, he's a good-looking guy, right?
- [Chelsea] Yeah, he is.

39:28.158 --> 39:33.455
Hey. Look at poor Chelsea here,
you know? She's stuck with me.

39:34.248 --> 39:36.750
Oh, maybe you can
give her some tips.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.002
Let her know how
to pull down the big game.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.964
- Dumb luck.
- [Danny] Yeah.

39:42.172 --> 39:44.091
Only thing I know about romance

39:44.174 --> 39:46.927
is you gotta be mysterious.
You gotta have some secrets.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.639
- Right?
- Are you keeping secrets from me?

39:50.722 --> 39:54.726
Oh, baby, I got a million of them.
A million of them.

39:54.935 --> 39:56.312
What about my sister?

39:58.563 --> 40:00.274
She got any secrets?

40:01.358 --> 40:04.903
I wouldn't know, would I?
I mean, it's a secret, right?

40:05.112 --> 40:06.238
[Meg laughs]

40:06.322 --> 40:09.866
You know what? That's the best part
about being with a cop.

40:09.950 --> 40:13.787
- Can't get anything past him.
- Oh, don't believe her.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.456
I'm sure she's got a few secrets.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.751
[Sally] Oh, will you stop
picking on your sister?

40:20.377 --> 40:22.004
- We all have secrets.
- [Danny] Yeah.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.507
Might have to do some cop work.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.092
Shine a light. Oh!

40:30.428 --> 40:32.306
There they are.

40:35.517 --> 40:38.770
Oh, how rude of me.
You guys don't have glasses.

40:39.146 --> 40:41.106
I'll get them, Mama.

40:41.357 --> 40:43.317
[Sally] Thanks, honey.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.320
So how've you been?

40:46.653 --> 40:48.822
- [Chelsea] I'm pretty good.
- [Sally] Sorry about that.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.742
I can't believe I forgot--
We're sitting here with our drinks and...

40:57.914 --> 40:59.291
Hey.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.793
This ends now.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.963
Okay. What are we talking about?

41:05.047 --> 41:07.716
That little fucking game
that you're playing outside.

41:08.342 --> 41:11.178
So you're not having fun anymore?

41:11.387 --> 41:13.555
What is it? You think you
have something on me?

41:13.638 --> 41:16.766
You think you can manipulate me
because I cheated on my boyfriend?

41:16.975 --> 41:19.602
Your fiancé now.
Now he's your fiancé.

41:19.686 --> 41:23.232
It's over. The game's over.
Do you understand me?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.608
Maybe it's not a game.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.492
Go tell him.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.453
He's sitting out there. Go tell him.

41:37.371 --> 41:40.290
- I don't think now's an appropriate time.
- Oh, really?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.167
I think it's a perfect time.

41:42.251 --> 41:45.587
What a fucking thrill for you
to humiliate me in front of Mom.

41:46.963 --> 41:49.799
Why would I wanna do that?

41:50.259 --> 41:53.011
No, you're right. You're right.

41:53.095 --> 41:55.138
You wanna keep it
and hang it over my head

41:55.222 --> 41:58.808
until the next time you want something?
Is that what it is?

41:59.309 --> 42:02.354
Fuck that, Danny. Go tell him.

42:05.523 --> 42:09.152
Or do you want me to do it?
Because I fucking will. I don't care.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.238
I'm not gonna live in fear of you.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.329
Okay.

42:26.211 --> 42:31.007
Does this mean that I'm not gonna
be doing the catering for the wedding?

42:31.216 --> 42:32.550
[door slams]

42:44.104 --> 42:47.732
I know you bailed him out of jail,
but how did he end up in jail?

42:47.816 --> 42:49.443
He owed a lot of money.

42:49.526 --> 42:53.655
So he stole painkillers from a pharmacy.
He got caught selling them.

42:53.863 --> 42:56.325
[John] Do you know
who he owed the money to?

42:56.408 --> 42:59.411
[Beth] The kind of guys that get it back,
or you get hurt.

43:00.537 --> 43:02.372
[John] So you know about the restaurant.

43:02.456 --> 43:04.249
[Beth] That's what he borrowed
the money for.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.587
I understand there was a fire.

43:10.755 --> 43:12.841
Danny said someone
torched the place.

43:13.216 --> 43:14.468
Did he say who?

43:17.887 --> 43:21.224
He had some partners.
Guys he borrowed from.

43:23.143 --> 43:26.688
Your brother didn't get any of the
insurance money, if that's what you think.

43:28.690 --> 43:30.275
No.

43:32.735 --> 43:35.071
He must have taken it hard,
losing the restaurant.

43:35.155 --> 43:38.200
Yeah. He did. Went on a bender.

43:38.408 --> 43:41.495
Coke. Vodka. More coke.

43:43.705 --> 43:45.374
Then he got weird.

43:45.582 --> 43:47.625
Weird? How?

43:51.713 --> 43:54.841
Speaking to people who weren't there.

43:55.050 --> 43:59.637
I heard him talking to some chick in the
bathroom once. Kept calling her Sarah.

44:00.389 --> 44:04.267
When I walked in, he was alone.

44:08.397 --> 44:10.106
Sarah.

44:14.194 --> 44:16.321
When's the last time
you talked to Danny?

44:18.198 --> 44:20.325
Couple months ago maybe.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.786
Guys keep showing up here
looking for him.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.372
Looking for what?

44:25.581 --> 44:27.583
Their money.

44:27.957 --> 44:30.877
They keep coming by asking for him.

44:31.086 --> 44:34.339
- Until recently.
- Maybe he paid them back.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.633
I seriously doubt that.

44:39.553 --> 44:42.764
You know, if you see him,
would you tell him that...

44:45.225 --> 44:47.185
Whatever.

44:48.520 --> 44:52.857
I still drive by his apartment sometimes,
wondering if he's gonna turn up.

44:56.653 --> 44:58.614
What apartment?

45:01.533 --> 45:03.701
[man] This is your brother's place here.

45:11.668 --> 45:14.087
I haven't seen the guy in weeks.

45:14.170 --> 45:17.966
His mail was piling up in his box.
That's the only reason I ever come here.

45:19.509 --> 45:22.554
Look, uh, I don't want
any trouble, detective.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.767
I got it from here.

45:27.976 --> 45:31.020
All right. Well, if you need
anything else, just holler.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.416
[footsteps]

45:58.965 --> 46:01.259
- May I join you?
- I didn't know you were home.

46:01.468 --> 46:05.514
- Yeah. Come on. Absolutely. Absolutely.
- [Sally sighs]

46:06.348 --> 46:08.350
It's beautiful.

46:14.856 --> 46:17.484
Are you gonna finish
rolling that joint or should I?

46:17.693 --> 46:19.068
[chuckles]

46:21.363 --> 46:22.905
Busted.

46:22.989 --> 46:24.449
[both laughing]

46:26.117 --> 46:30.497
Oh, you busted me cold, Mom.
You busted me cold.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.722
[♪♪♪]

47:46.114 --> 47:48.784
I haven't done this since I was a kid.

47:49.743 --> 47:51.578
[groans]

47:52.579 --> 47:54.706
Your father did not approve.

47:55.331 --> 47:59.961
You know, for all his libertarian ways,
he was a bit of a stick in the mud.

48:00.044 --> 48:03.840
Yeah. The stick was stuck
somewhere anyway.

48:03.923 --> 48:05.592
[both chuckling]

48:07.260 --> 48:10.054
I was fun once.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.474
Even a little wild.

48:13.057 --> 48:14.309
[Sally sighs]

48:14.392 --> 48:16.519
Back in high school,

48:16.603 --> 48:20.857
every weekend my girlfriends
and I would hang out near the Navy base.

48:21.316 --> 48:27.405
We were about 17, so we had to take
turns finding a sailor to buy us liquor.

48:28.948 --> 48:30.784
Oh, wow.

48:30.867 --> 48:33.578
No. That's how you met Dad?

48:35.330 --> 48:37.582
I thought Aunt Charlotte
introduced you.

48:37.791 --> 48:40.877
That's the story
that your father liked to tell.

48:41.419 --> 48:44.840
I'd sneak out of the house,
me and my girlfriends,

48:44.922 --> 48:48.050
and we'd hitchhike all the way
to the east side of town

48:48.134 --> 48:52.096
to this bar called Ruby's.

48:53.014 --> 48:57.143
Must have been my turn
to find a sailor.

48:57.226 --> 49:01.731
I remember looking
around the room and there he was.

49:02.482 --> 49:04.567
In uniform.

49:05.151 --> 49:07.612
Those killer blue eyes.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.825
He was...

49:13.117 --> 49:14.160
[sighs]

49:15.161 --> 49:17.372
He was beautiful.

49:21.584 --> 49:24.880
And very, very persuasive.

49:27.131 --> 49:30.719
We spent the night together
in the back of his pickup.

49:32.804 --> 49:37.099
- Oh, you mean my pickup? Yeah?
- [laughs]

49:37.183 --> 49:38.643
Yeah.

49:39.728 --> 49:42.104
- Behind a parking lot.
- Mm.

49:43.272 --> 49:48.319
And I think we saw each other
every day for the next month.

49:48.403 --> 49:51.656
And he got transferred down here.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.366
And you followed him down.

49:53.575 --> 49:57.662
Yeah. One day he called.
He said he'd bought some land and...

49:59.372 --> 50:01.583
Why don't I come down
and marry him?

50:03.835 --> 50:05.294
Just like that?

50:07.505 --> 50:09.465
Yeah. I didn't even
tell my parents.

50:09.549 --> 50:15.555
I just packed my bags and got on a bus.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.308
- Weren't you worried?
- I was terrified.

50:19.392 --> 50:22.478
I think I cried the whole way down.

50:22.729 --> 50:24.146
[sighs]

50:24.773 --> 50:26.399
Yeah.

50:29.444 --> 50:31.446
That's what you do.

50:32.989 --> 50:34.616
What do you mean?

50:38.035 --> 50:40.956
When you feel you have
no choice, so you...

50:41.998 --> 50:43.374
You run away.

50:46.335 --> 50:47.879
Yeah.

50:48.964 --> 50:51.173
Yeah. I guess you do.

51:22.330 --> 51:23.873
[♪♪♪]

51:55.947 --> 51:57.699

over car stereo]

51:57.782 --> 52:00.451
[police siren blaring]

52:02.829 --> 52:06.749
Oh, you gotta be fucking
kidding me. Really?

52:22.765 --> 52:25.393
Hello, officer.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.021
Get out of the car.

52:28.980 --> 52:31.148
The handle doesn't work.

52:35.945 --> 52:39.490
- What'd I do wrong, officer?
- Move to the front.

52:39.574 --> 52:42.618
Move to the front. Turn around.
Put your hands on the hood.

52:42.827 --> 52:45.788
[Eric groans] What this time?

52:45.997 --> 52:47.248
Spread them.

52:57.592 --> 52:58.885
[door buzzes, then opens]

53:01.345 --> 53:03.014
[door closes]

53:19.655 --> 53:21.824
Let's talk about Danny.

53:25.870 --> 53:27.705
[♪♪♪]
