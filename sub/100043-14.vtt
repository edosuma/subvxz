WEBVTT

00:05.047 --> 00:06.465
Are you awake?

00:06.465 --> 00:08.926
I slept for six minutes two hours ago.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.427
I'm gonna have to take a sleeping pill,

00:10.511 --> 00:11.845
which means you're gonna
have to hide my car keys,

00:11.929 --> 00:13.514
laptop and Reba McEntire wig.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.475
It's been a crazy couple of days.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.977
Uh, yesterday I found out I didn't
get the college football coaching job

00:19.061 --> 00:20.562
that I had been chasing.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.897
I was... I was devastated.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.983
And moments before that, we got a phone
call from our old adoption agency

00:25.067 --> 00:27.402
with the opportunity for us
to adopt a baby boy.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.154
So, a door closes...

00:29.238 --> 00:31.865
A window opens. But do you answer it?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.283
You don't answer windows.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.495
How fun for you.
Cam made a little mistake.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.791
I keep making lists of all the pros
and cons in my head. Uh...

00:40.791 --> 00:42.584
The way a baby smells is on both.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.711
Okay, all right. Pros? Go.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.089
Okay, well, a baby to love.
The sound of giggling.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.968
A bigger family, an extra vote
on whether to pull the plug

00:50.968 --> 00:52.302
on us when we get old.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.179
I'm worried that Lily
has an itchy trigger finger.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.764
Yeah, and another child
would help us figure out

00:55.848 --> 00:58.392
how much of Lily's personality
is our fault and what's on her.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.560
It would be nice to be vindicated.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.396
- Okay, other pros. Christmases.
- Oh.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.147
Dipping little toes into the ocean

01:04.231 --> 01:05.357
- for the first time...
- Yeah.

01:05.357 --> 01:08.151
...the way a toddler runs towards the door
in their jammies...

01:08.235 --> 01:09.862
- Hmm.
- ...saying "Daddy!"

01:09.862 --> 01:12.114
Okay. You better hit me with some cons.
I'm practically ovulating.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.324
Okay. No sleep, car seats...

01:14.408 --> 01:15.659
- Oh.
- ...diapers,

01:15.659 --> 01:18.704
coughs and colds,
all the doctor's appointments,

01:18.704 --> 01:20.873
- plastic toys everywhere.
- Everywhere.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.749
Our place is already too small.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.543
- We don't have enough bedrooms.
- Mmm-mmm.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.630
Oh, God, the clock is ticking. We have
half a day to give them an answer.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.632
Okay, you know what? No thinking...

01:30.716 --> 01:31.717
...on the count of three.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.802
Say yes or no.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.305
One, two, three...

01:37.639 --> 01:39.183
- I don't know.
- I can't decide!

01:53.572 --> 01:56.617
Hey, why is there a black
Suburban outside with a driver?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.202
My company sent it.

01:58.202 --> 02:02.080
I'm manning the Helo Dynamics booth
for the job recruitment fair at Caltech.

02:02.164 --> 02:07.044
Wow! Look at you,
being chauffeured in a giant SUV.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.796
When I picture you driving,
you're crying in a Prius.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.465
I do cry less when I'm driven.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.509
And that outfit is on point.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.803
Well, I mean, it's sort of
a triumphant return for me.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.805
I spent four years there in sweats

02:18.889 --> 02:21.433
with greasy hair,
caring only about grades.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.684
The only time anyone ever noticed me

02:22.768 --> 02:26.063
was when I pulled out all my
eyebrows during finals week.

02:26.063 --> 02:29.274
Now I have a big job, swanky apartment,

02:29.358 --> 02:31.944
shoes that cost more than my first laptop.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.278
Oh, it's like a rom-com.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.822
You left a nerd, and returned a hot nerd.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.158
Oh! Speaking of hot people,

02:38.242 --> 02:40.035
maybe I should go and recruit for NERP.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.539
For legal reasons, we need
a science-y person to endorse product.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.666
Considering we're all a bunch of people
who didn't graduate college,

02:45.666 --> 02:48.126
we sell a lot of products
that go inside of you.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.462
Yeah. No, it doesn't really work that way.

02:50.546 --> 02:54.383
A, you have to be invited,
and B, no self-respecting scientist

02:54.383 --> 02:56.885
is going to endorse the nonsense
your company is pushing.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.680
Excuse me, but our
copper-infused toothpaste

02:59.680 --> 03:02.140
is on the FDA's top 10 items to watch.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.267
So...

03:05.018 --> 03:07.020
Phil. Phil, can you come in here?

03:07.104 --> 03:09.439
I've worked up a little presentation

03:09.523 --> 03:11.900
for my Skype interview,
and I would love to get your feedback.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.485
Yes, please.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.779
You've been such a cheerleader
for me with all my magic shows

03:15.863 --> 03:18.657
and SCARB dinners,
I'd love to be yours. Hit it.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.617
I'm gonna stop you right there.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.497
I've been out of work for a few months,
and I've gotten kind of antsy.

03:25.581 --> 03:29.126
To channel my anxiety, I have
cleaned, I have organized.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.171
- Perhaps a bit obsessively.
- Doctors were consulted.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.673
One, a therapist,
so not even a real doctor.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.508
But meds were quickly dismissed.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.677
We didn't want the sexual side effects.

03:39.011 --> 03:43.515
Anyway, I am going to channel
my anxiety into a career.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.893
I am interviewing for my dream job.

03:45.893 --> 03:51.565
Senior VP of my favorite organizing
chain store, Organize 'Em.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.359
- I'm so excited, I could have an organasm.
- You're better than that.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.572
So throughout the call,
I'm gonna be referring

03:58.572 --> 04:00.115
to this organizational system

04:00.199 --> 04:03.493
that I created using
the "Organize 'Em" products.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.287
- Smart.
- Yeah, watch.

04:06.079 --> 04:11.084
Oh, Ms. Beckman, what an interesting
point. I should jot that down.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.378
Boop... Bop...

04:13.462 --> 04:15.172
Bam.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.510
What the hell is that?

04:21.637 --> 04:23.514
Oh, my God. What...

04:23.514 --> 04:24.640
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.850
Your dad came over to help me.
I gotta fix that step.

04:26.934 --> 04:30.312
It splintered. I wiped out this
morning and landed on my head.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.438
Yeah, but my call.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.732
We gotta take care of that
before someone gets hurt.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.816
Someone did.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.818
I mean, what if it was Haley
with the babies, or Dylan?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.237
Or me. I threw up.

04:38.237 --> 04:42.616
Holy Moses, Gloria was here yesterday
in heels. That could've been ugly.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.742
I'm sleepy.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.078
Buddy, you gotta move.
Someone's gonna trip over you.

04:46.078 --> 04:50.666
Hey, guys, we can't do this right now.
Okay? I've got an interview at 1:23.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.792
Well, that's specific.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.585
No, not for Audrey Beckman.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.963
Her whole life is scheduled
down to the second.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.673
She's a god to OCD people.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.007
Why do you think
I've got that bumper sticker

04:59.091 --> 05:01.760
that says "Straighten It Like Beckman"?

05:01.844 --> 05:03.262
Can I come down now?

05:03.262 --> 05:06.181
If I don't have the babies' bottles
when they wake up, they're mean.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.433
You're not even in the terrible twos yet.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.810
Oh. When do those start?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.520
Okay, look, it's almost time.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.690
Just, please, nobody make any noise,
nobody go in that office.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.400
I have all my ducks in a row.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.026
I'm just gonna run upstairs
and change my shirt.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.320
- Uh, okay, but be careful.
- I know what I'm doing, honey.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.239
I've got this.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.365
Oh, boy! Oh, God!

05:23.365 --> 05:26.326
My leg is stuck! Somebody do something.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.496
I'm really good at getting rings off.
Do you want me to butter your thighs?

05:30.122 --> 05:32.124
Hey, Dylan, sometimes
I like to play things out

05:32.124 --> 05:34.126
in my head first, if that's helpful.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.381
Hey, honey, we need to talk
to you about something.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.467
Sweetie, this is something pretty big,
and I want you to brace yourself.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.804
The adoption agency called...

05:45.888 --> 05:47.139
I'm not going back.

05:47.139 --> 05:50.142
Do you know what happens to soft,
entitled kids in Da Nang?

05:50.142 --> 05:53.061
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, n... No, no.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.439
There's a baby boy.

05:55.981 --> 05:56.982
Oh.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.358
I think you should do it.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.985
Really? Just like that?

05:59.985 --> 06:02.279
Whatever stops you
dropping by my sleepovers.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.323
You guys are way too focused on me.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.283
Plus, I think it'd be fun
to have a baby brother.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.035
- Oh.
- Although...

06:08.035 --> 06:09.203
Although what?

06:09.203 --> 06:11.538
Aren't you guys kind of old
to be having a baby?

06:11.997 --> 06:14.082
I'm getting into the juicy part
of my teen years.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.792
I don't want to have to take over for you.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.961
Okay... We are not that old.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.087
You're like 50.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.255
Oh, my God!

06:20.339 --> 06:23.717
No. Daddy is 44, and I'm 48.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.345
You do realize when the baby's
a senior in high school,

06:26.345 --> 06:27.971
you guys will be senior citizens?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.475
- We will not be senior... Sixty-six.
- Cam...

06:31.475 --> 06:32.559
I'll be 66.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.685
And I'll be 61.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.687
- Well, 62.
- Not until June!

06:39.066 --> 06:42.236
It's not working. My leg
is really stuck in there. Oh...

06:42.361 --> 06:44.238
It might be time to return to my idea.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.572
I'm not cutting my leg off.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.866
Think about how fast
you would run with a robot leg.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.285
Luke, your mom's not getting a robot leg.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.704
She'd need two,
or she'd just run in circles.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.206
Come on,
let's check under the stairs.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.166
Yes, please, and hurry.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.001
What the hell is the matter
with this house?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.337
How could two steps be broken?

07:03.257 --> 07:06.301
My God, the humidity.
My hair's gonna frizz out.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.262
That's why I never show
any pictures from 'Nam.

07:08.262 --> 07:12.140
No, I totally forgot about the
humidifier for my mushroom log.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.228
It needed darkness and moisture.
It must have rotted the wood.

07:18.522 --> 07:21.400
Wow, honey, you're really
wedged in here tight.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.484
Yeah, no kidding.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.738
Why can't you buy your mushrooms
at a store like a normal person?

07:26.822 --> 07:27.823
Store-bought mushrooms?

07:28.115 --> 07:32.327
You really don't get my generation,
boomer. Maybe this will enlighten you.

07:32.411 --> 07:33.453
Open up.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.289
Get your hand away from my...
Open up.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.294
That's damn good.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.423
Why do I always default to no?
Is Gloria right?

07:44.840 --> 07:46.633
Should I try slim-cut jeans?

07:47.885 --> 07:49.511
Guys, what's going on down there?

07:49.595 --> 07:51.722
Your foot's stuck
between two copper pipes.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.725
We're gonna have to cut it.
It might take a while.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.518
I don't have a while.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.812
I can't believe this.
I'm going to miss my interview.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.606
And this was my dream job.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.983
I was gonna get to organize
the whole world,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.485
and now everything's gonna stay so messy.

08:05.569 --> 08:06.737
Can't you just reschedule it?

08:06.737 --> 08:08.989
No. Phil, I'd look like a flake.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.868
This is an organizational company,
not the loosey-goosey world of real estate

08:12.868 --> 08:14.036
where everything's,

08:14.036 --> 08:15.913
"See you noon to 3:00,
and I'll bring the cookies."

08:16.914 --> 08:17.956
I'm sorry. I'm lashing out.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.834
No, it's okay. The lion doesn't lose
sleep over the opinions of sheep.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.212
Honey, just take the call from there.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.507
How ridiculous would I look
taking a call on stairs?

08:26.507 --> 08:27.799
Plus, I need my shelves.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.344
'Cause I had this whole thing
worked out with the products.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.637
You don't need gimmicks.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.182
You were the CEO
for Pritchett's freaking Closets.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.808
You know how many people can say that?

08:36.934 --> 08:37.935
Me and you.

08:38.185 --> 08:41.438
And Margaret, every five years
when I went under for my colonoscopy.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.860
Fine. Give me my phone.
I'll bomb the interview from right here.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.948
She's lost her confidence.
She needs those shelves.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.824
You know what?
If she can't get to the office,

08:52.908 --> 08:54.326
we can bring the office to her.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.748
You're staring. I'm frizzing, aren't I?

09:01.625 --> 09:04.711
<i>I've got to admit,
walking onto that campus,</i>

09:04.795 --> 09:07.172
<i>all those eyes on me, the adoration...</i>

09:07.256 --> 09:09.258
It felt good. It felt right.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.302
Like I had earned everything
that was coming my way.

09:12.803 --> 09:13.846
You suck!

09:15.264 --> 09:16.890
No, you!

09:17.391 --> 09:20.310
- What?
- Helo Dynamics is evil.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.229
Excuse me? We help people.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.607
Yeah, people like fascists,
dictators, oligarchs.

09:25.691 --> 09:28.694
What are you talking about?
We make things like facial scanners

09:28.694 --> 09:31.488
that detect predisposition
to genetic diseases.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.700
Which oppressive governments use
to identify political dissidents.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.912
Well, I mean,
it's also used on video chats

09:38.996 --> 09:41.915
to turn yourself into a unicorn.
Name one thing more fun.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.877
Why don't you walk your fancy
shoes out of here, you sellout?

09:44.877 --> 09:48.088
Why is someone wearing socks and sandals
yelling at your fabulous shoes?

09:48.172 --> 09:49.673
- BOY 1: Sellout!
- I don't know.

09:49.673 --> 09:50.924
And what are you doing here?

09:51.008 --> 09:54.219
I'm recruiting for NERP.
I told you I need a science-y person.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.763
You can't just saunter in here.
You have to be approved.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.224
Oh. Hey, kid. You don't care
what you look like. You must be smart.

09:59.308 --> 10:00.976
Wanna work at a place
that has a lot of hot girls?

10:00.976 --> 10:03.854
Stop it! Could you make this
horrible situation any worse?

10:04.229 --> 10:07.691
Hell no, Helo! It's time you go!

10:07.691 --> 10:08.901
I didn't do that.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.528
Hell no, Helo! It's time you go!

10:11.612 --> 10:13.155
I've never seen nerds
swarm like this before.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.240
We're not typically a clustering people.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.366
Oh, my God! It's Arvin.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.535
No. I emailed him I'd be here.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.787
Oh, this is going to be so awkward for me.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.040
The last time I saw him,
I broke his heart.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.124
Awkward for you?

10:24.208 --> 10:27.127
These people hate me so much,
they're making eye contact.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.715
Alex, hi. What's all the... Haley?

10:32.257 --> 10:34.009
Arvin. Hi.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.344
I didn't know you'd be here.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.429
This isn't
going to be easy to say.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.223
I got married, and I have twins.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.349
I know. Yes.

10:40.349 --> 10:43.268
It was the lead story
in Dylan's holiday newsletter.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.771
You sure you haven't been
stalking a little?

10:45.771 --> 10:47.189
No, no, that's why.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.692
Alex, is this directed at you?

10:51.151 --> 10:55.322
Yes. Yes, it is. And they are so mean!

10:55.322 --> 10:56.573
Hell no, Helo! It's time you go!

10:56.657 --> 10:57.783
Uh, excuse me. Uh...

10:57.783 --> 11:01.036
You all know I'm a cool guy, right?

11:01.036 --> 11:06.917
I'm chill with you calling me "Arvin."
We had class outside that one time.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.335
Hmm? Will you just give us a minute?

11:08.335 --> 11:12.130
I assure you, she will feel
the full effects of my rage.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.509
- So, how have you been?
- Not so great.

11:15.509 --> 11:19.513
- They're not fans of your employer?
- Which is so unfair.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.933
I'm doing very advanced research
that could have far-reaching implications.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.893
Yeah. Of course you are. One sec.

11:24.977 --> 11:28.897
- How do you sleep at night?
- Okay, so you too?

11:28.981 --> 11:32.568
No, of course not. I'm not here
to judge you or your boss.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.570
Satan!

11:36.113 --> 11:38.407
Anyway, I just thought
I'd drop by and say a quick hello.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.783
Haley, lovely to see you.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.034
You have to move on.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.121
Alex, I wish you nothing
but the best. Okay.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.832
Right, guys. Now with feeling.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.755
Hell no, Helo! It's time you go!

11:53.839 --> 11:57.759
What Lily said really got to us.
Maybe we are too old to have a new baby.

11:57.843 --> 12:01.430
Yesterday I found hairs on my ears
and I yelled at the local news.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.224
And I called <i>Seinfeld "Steinfeld."</i>

12:04.850 --> 12:05.893
You know, but on the other hand,

12:05.893 --> 12:08.478
there are a lot of men
our age having babies.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.481
Yes, but they have
second wives and nannies,

12:11.565 --> 12:12.983
who are often the same person.

12:12.983 --> 12:17.154
We just needed to talk to a parent
that had a baby when they were old.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.407
You must be mistaken,
because I had Joe when I was 35.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.492
No, I remember, you had just turned...

12:22.576 --> 12:25.996
She's not gonna budge.
Okay, just tell us, how hard is it?

12:25.996 --> 12:28.665
Well, are there nights
where you don't sleep

12:28.749 --> 12:31.126
and you want to kill yourself? Of course.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.504
Are there shooting pains in your back

12:33.504 --> 12:38.675
from picking the baby
and putting him down? Constantly.

12:38.759 --> 12:39.843
Okay, well, is there a "but"?

12:39.927 --> 12:42.221
It's hanging in there,
but it's not the same.

12:42.221 --> 12:45.599
Look, I know that you guys
worry that you're too old,

12:45.599 --> 12:51.522
or too slow to have a baby
at this age, but guess what.

12:51.522 --> 12:52.856
You can!

12:53.524 --> 12:54.858
What the hell was that?

12:54.942 --> 12:59.655
A doll. It was supposed to prove
that you guys were ready to have a baby,

12:59.655 --> 13:02.658
but if this was a real one,
you would've killed it.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.285
Well, wouldn't it be your fault
for throwing it?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.329
Give me a break. I was trying something.

13:07.329 --> 13:09.706
I'm in the middle of selling a house.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.125
Oh, yeah. It's very cute, by the way.
How many bedrooms is it?

13:12.209 --> 13:13.252
Three and a den.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.921
Oh, that's one more than we have.
Mitchell, this house, huh?

13:15.921 --> 13:17.673
Cam, I can't even begin
to think about a house

13:17.673 --> 13:20.509
when we haven't even made a decision
about whether or not we're gonna...

13:20.509 --> 13:22.719
But maybe it's a sign. You know,
the new job goes away,

13:22.803 --> 13:24.012
baby comes along, and all of a sudden,

13:24.096 --> 13:25.806
we're standing
in a charming three-bedroom...

13:25.806 --> 13:26.932
Three and a half bath.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.433
Which, holy cow, we could afford

13:28.517 --> 13:30.227
if we just switch back
to grocery store face cream.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.938
- No.
- And it's in a great school district.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.356
You know what? She's right about that.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.607
They have a full-time nurse.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.734
We have a Band-Aid jar
and a can of ginger ale.

13:37.818 --> 13:41.363
Okay. We already have too much
on our plate. We're not buying this house.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.740
Oh, and in the basement,
they have a karaoke room

13:43.824 --> 13:48.328
for people that want to impersonate divas
without their fathers seeing them.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.248
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to look.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.337
I don't know, guys. Does it really
look like I'm in my office?

13:57.421 --> 13:58.630
Jaws wasn't a real shark,

13:58.714 --> 13:59.882
but I still wouldn't sit

13:59.882 --> 14:01.300
on a toilet seat for months.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.384
How's this angle, Mom?

14:02.968 --> 14:04.970
Um... Eh, fine, I guess.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.015
My cheek is itching.
Is there something on my face?

14:08.015 --> 14:10.726
Admiral Ackbar,
what the hell happened to you?

14:10.726 --> 14:12.394
I'll bet it was your stupid mushrooms.

14:12.394 --> 14:16.190
Why do I try new things?
I'm sticking to my Brett Favre jeans.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.691
Oh, God! That's her,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.276
that's her. Shh! Everybody, quiet.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.360
Wait. I have to get up there
with the babies...

14:20.444 --> 14:21.695
Shh! Sit!

14:23.155 --> 14:26.366
Hi, Ms. Beckman.
Thank you so much for this...

14:28.202 --> 14:29.912
...opportunity.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.205
<i>You're welcome.</i>

14:31.205 --> 14:32.331
<i>Uh...</i>

14:32.623 --> 14:33.790
<i>I wasn't mocking you.</i>

14:33.874 --> 14:36.627
<i>It's just that whenever I hear
someone sneeze, I have to sneeze, too,</i>

14:36.627 --> 14:38.086
<i>so that it's an even number.</i>

14:38.170 --> 14:39.630
<i>It's perfectly normal.</i>

14:39.630 --> 14:41.757
Oh. No, I completely understand.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.593
A few years ago, I forgot to tap
the towel rod twice

14:44.593 --> 14:48.222
when I got out of the shower, and we lost
George Michael that day, so...

14:48.222 --> 14:49.973
That was you?

14:50.057 --> 14:52.184
<i>Let me tell you
a little bit about our company.</i>

14:52.184 --> 14:56.188
Oh. I'd love that, but first,
I'd like to take some notes.

14:57.981 --> 14:58.982
Tilt up!

14:59.066 --> 15:01.235
It's what I love about this industry.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.320
Never a dull moment.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.738
It's not plugged in!

15:09.326 --> 15:12.996
<i>We like to think of Organize 'Em
as a wellness company...</i>

15:14.790 --> 15:16.416
<i>A mindfulness company...</i>

15:17.835 --> 15:19.253
<i>Are your shelves shaking?</i>

15:19.795 --> 15:20.796
Uh...

15:20.796 --> 15:23.841
Yeah. Yeah. I think we're having
a little earthquake.

15:23.841 --> 15:26.009
You know what? Why don't
I tell you a little something

15:26.093 --> 15:27.094
about myself?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.722
I like to think
that I'm the kind of person

15:30.806 --> 15:34.184
who can see where the consumer
trends are leaning,

15:34.852 --> 15:37.563
adjust quickly
and lean back the other direction.

15:40.858 --> 15:41.942
Oh, my God!

15:43.569 --> 15:45.487
Do I love organizing.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.531
Baby, do I love it.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.992
<i>Ms. Dunphy, have you been drinking?</i>

15:50.576 --> 15:52.452
Just lie. She can't smell your breath.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.121
No, Poppy, no!

15:55.414 --> 15:56.915
Oh...

16:00.169 --> 16:02.671
<i>- What the hell is happening?</i>
- I'm calling it.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.592
I'm sorry, Ms. Beckman.
This was a terrible idea.

16:07.259 --> 16:11.263
Okay. I fell through a step,
and my leg is stuck.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.892
And, listen, there's no company
I would rather work for.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.393
I didn't want to cancel on you,

16:16.393 --> 16:21.773
so I asked my family to make it
look like this was my office.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.526
Jay Pritchett, closeteer,
but you probably know that.

16:26.028 --> 16:29.156
<i>Could you just please
get him out of my earshot?</i>

16:29.573 --> 16:30.949
Yeah, yeah, sure.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.117
Listen.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.913
I wanted you to think that I was a person
who had it all together, but I'm not.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.665
The reality is I live in chaos.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.584
But that's why I love your products.

16:40.584 --> 16:43.670
When my kids are fighting,
or the grandkids are crying,

16:43.754 --> 16:47.591
or my husband is making pancakes
on a pogo stick,

16:47.591 --> 16:50.385
I know that I can go into my office

16:50.469 --> 16:53.347
and file bills in a color-coded divider,

16:53.347 --> 16:56.350
and experience one moment of peace.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.853
I know I'm what your company needs,

17:00.145 --> 17:02.314
because I know how much
I need your company.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.235
<i>Wow.</i>

17:06.777 --> 17:08.195
I got the job!

17:08.195 --> 17:11.907
I'm so proud of her.
I guess it's our lucky step.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.328
Don't worry. It's just me.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.038
- Oh.
- See?

17:22.167 --> 17:23.710
You know what? You could have defended me.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.337
Hmm. Should I have?

17:26.004 --> 17:27.422
Are you saying you agree with them?

17:27.506 --> 17:29.299
I found their chant rather simplistic.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.844
You know, I would have probably
gone with something like,

17:31.844 --> 17:34.471
"Helo Dynamics
is a multinational corporation

17:34.555 --> 17:37.474
"that prioritizes profits over ethics."

17:37.558 --> 17:39.810
I knew it. You are judging me.

17:39.810 --> 17:42.104
Do you judge
all of your students like this?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.188
Alex...

17:43.689 --> 17:46.400
All my students don't have
the potential you do.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.320
You are extraordinary.
You are meant to change the world!

17:52.114 --> 17:53.699
It's not just me that thinks it.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.869
- Dylan said so in his newsletter.
- Oh, spare me.

17:56.869 --> 17:59.788
The sanctimonious academic
looking down on the star pupil

17:59.872 --> 18:02.082
because of her $1,000 shoes.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.501
- Those shoes were $1,000?
- Damn it.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.461
Do they come with medicine for a village?

18:06.545 --> 18:09.339
You know what? I hate to say it,
but I don't need your approval

18:09.423 --> 18:11.049
because I love what I do.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.594
Ah. Well, I am sorry to hear that.

18:13.594 --> 18:14.678
- Don't be.
- I'm sorry,

18:14.678 --> 18:19.266
because I'm assembling a research team
to create AI capable of everything,

18:19.266 --> 18:24.062
from discovering exoplanets in deep space
to biomarkers of disease in humans.

18:24.146 --> 18:28.650
And you would've been a superb addition

18:28.734 --> 18:31.528
to an exceptional team, but...

18:31.612 --> 18:35.574
Well, Professor, you can take that job

18:36.408 --> 18:37.993
and give it to me.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.078
But I'm going to need you
to match my salary.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.122
- I'm not sure we have that kind of money.
- Deal.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.168
I'm gonna go see
if I can still return these.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.048
And finally back
to the beautiful family room.

18:51.048 --> 18:53.217
- It's great.
- I mean, it is beautiful.

18:53.217 --> 18:57.721
I can see you both having a delightful
misunderstanding here.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.181
Okay. Now, Mitchell...
Hmm?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.558
...you know I'm not usually impulsive.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.519
Please. You never go
to the grocery store alone

19:03.519 --> 19:04.728
and not come home with a balloon.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.939
That bathroom upstairs is amazing.

19:06.939 --> 19:10.025
Yeah, and I do love the idea
of me having my own sink.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.528
Our housekeeper would finally realize
who the real villain is.

19:12.528 --> 19:14.655
Okay, so we should do it. Let's do it.

19:15.239 --> 19:17.074
- Buy this house?
- Yeah.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.243
We haven't even made
a decision about the baby yet.

19:19.243 --> 19:22.579
Oh. Another broker just sent me a text.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.665
An offer is coming at 6:00.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.750
Great. Another ticking clock.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.753
Let's also disarm a time-bomb
while buying Beyoncé tickets online

19:29.837 --> 19:30.879
with an expired credit card.

19:30.963 --> 19:32.047
Okay, that one got to me.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.215
I'm having a hard time breathing.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.299
I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack!

19:34.383 --> 19:37.010
And this big family room
with the cozy fireplace

19:37.094 --> 19:39.346
is the perfect place to have that.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.474
Okay. You know what, Gloria?
Stop. We need to think.

19:42.558 --> 19:45.269
No, no, we do not need to think.
We need to stop this.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.271
Okay, within the span of 18 hours,

19:47.271 --> 19:50.232
we're supposed to completely
and utterly change our lives?

19:50.232 --> 19:53.485
No, no big, life-altering decisions
should be made that way.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.529
You're right.

19:55.529 --> 19:58.490
You know, it's... Then... let's not.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.576
- Okay.
- It's way too much.

20:00.576 --> 20:04.913
When things are right, it shouldn't be
a struggle like this. You just know it.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.164
Yeah, I know.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.500
That little boy, he's gonna find
an amazing family, right?

20:08.584 --> 20:10.878
- Of course he is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.088
You know what? I already...

20:13.172 --> 20:14.548
I already feel a little lighter.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.175
- And we don't need the stress of moving.
- No.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.427
Because, you know what? I love our house.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.637
- I do, too.
- It is not perfect, but neither are we.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.431
- We aren't.
- And neither is your car.

20:22.431 --> 20:24.808
Can you please remove
that thing from the driveway?

20:24.892 --> 20:27.144
I'm trying to sell a lifestyle here.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.270
Oh.

20:28.270 --> 20:32.316
- Is it the adoption agency?
- Yeah. Um...

20:33.025 --> 20:34.818
- I'll tell them.
- Yeah.

20:34.902 --> 20:35.903
Hello.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.911
Yes, my husband and I
would love to adopt him.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.871
Let's write up an offer.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.299
- Dad, wake up.
- Huh? What happened?

20:57.299 --> 20:59.968
I think Daddy took a sleeping pill again. Oh.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.053
Is he... Yeah.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.179
Okay.

21:02.179 --> 21:06.225
<i>He taught me
to love him and promised to love</i>

21:06.225 --> 21:09.728
<i>And cherish me over all others above</i>

21:09.728 --> 21:12.022
Come on, sing it with me, Tucson.

21:12.606 --> 21:16.026
<i>My poor heart is wondering
No misery can tell...</i>

21:16.026 --> 21:18.946
Hey, Mitchell, I have
a dozen wings for Reba.

21:18.946 --> 21:22.032
Yeah, okay. Thank you so much, Corey.
We'll see you next time.

21:22.032 --> 21:23.283
Tony, I'm getting a little feedback
in my ear here.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.578
Tony Hammond, ladies and gentlemen!
