00:33.575 --> 00:35.827
<i>Wind, seven miles per hour from the north.</i>

00:35.910 --> 00:38.538
<i>Barometric pressure 29.73.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.249
<i>Dew point: 64 degrees.</i>

00:41.332 --> 00:43.960
Can't we just listen to music
when we wake up?

00:44.335 --> 00:46.963

Wait. What was the dew point again?

00:52.218 --> 00:53.720
Uhh...

00:54.304 --> 00:55.430
Morning, Aunt Peggy.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.391
Go home.

00:59.934 --> 01:00.852


01:03.313 --> 01:04.314
Good morning.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.857
Again.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.570
Hope you don't mind.
I crashed on your couch last night.

01:10.653 --> 01:14.074
I was gonna sleep on the air mattress,
but I fell asleep blowing it up.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.661
Morning, Uncle Hank.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.830


01:20.914 --> 01:21.873
Here you go.

01:21.956 --> 01:25.043
Two dollops of shaving cream
I borrowed from you last week.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.544
Keep the baggie as interest.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.129
Uh... thanks, Lucky,

01:28.213 --> 01:30.715
-but you really didn't have to...
Yes, I did.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.469
It'd be against my code of honor
to borrow something and not pay it back.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.513
As my grandpappy used to say...

01:37.013 --> 01:38.890
Perfect. He's got a grandpappy.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.850


01:44.479 --> 01:45.647
Lucky and I watched

01:45.730 --> 01:48.191
a police chase for two hours last night.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.111
He says what you're supposed
to do in that situation

01:51.194 --> 01:52.612
is run into a mall.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.907
Well, as Lucky says, "I'm outy."

01:56.783 --> 01:58.493
I am going to snap, Hank.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.286
Lucky never leaves.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.747
Do you know he's having
his <i>TV Guide</i> sent here?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.999
I know. And whenever I come home,

02:05.083 --> 02:07.961
the TV's always set
to the Game Show Network.

02:08.044 --> 02:11.256
I don't even know why
it bothers me so much, but it does.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.341
And he's a bad influence on Luanne.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.552
She can do whatever she wants
with her life.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.720
Finish college, open her own salon,

02:17.804 --> 02:21.182
but she is never gonna do anything
with that loser in the picture.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.477
Hey, is that Lucky on <i>Cops?</i>

02:28.940 --> 02:31.734
I can't believe that
Luanne is throwing her life away

02:31.818 --> 02:33.611
on a guy whose big claim to fame

02:33.695 --> 02:36.698
is that he "slipped on pee pee"
at the Costco,

02:36.781 --> 02:39.450
and got a $53,000 settlement.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.787
And he's pretty much blown through that
making his truck shiny.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.206
I don't know. There's something
about that one tooth of his

02:45.290 --> 02:46.124
that's kind of sexy.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.960
Don't worry, Peggy Hill.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.795
Lucky won't be around forever.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.256
He got hunting accident
written all over him.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.467
Oh, shush. Here he comes.

02:56.551 --> 03:00.054
Ladies, <i>Family Feud's</i> a Dawson,
if y'all want to come on in.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.525
Still warm.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.110
Uh-huh.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.655
So Luanne tells me you won
four substitute teacher awards.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.573
Three.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.991
Well, it should have been four.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.244
I guess some people are happy to say
the same old Pledge of Allegiance

03:23.328 --> 03:24.579
for the rest of their lives.

03:24.662 --> 03:28.541
Well, I've been thinking
about getting my GED.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.420
I was just wondering if you could,
you know, tutor me?

03:32.503 --> 03:35.340
Ugh. You don't even have
a high school education?

03:35.423 --> 03:36.382
No, ma'am.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.427
My formal education
ended at the ninth grade.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.346
That's when I started smoking.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.932
And they wouldn't
let me smoke in school, so...

03:44.015 --> 03:45.183
Wonderful.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.853
I can't even say it was the wrong choice
since I been smoking ever since.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.855
Yeah, I'll see if my schedule permits.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.318
If Hank knew you touched his underpants,
he'd put you through a wall.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.822
Well, of course I'm not gonna tutor him.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.617
Just the thought of being
in the same room with him... Ugh.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.370
Well, Lucky wants to earn his GED.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.081
You got to hand it to a guy
who wants to better himself.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.916
If someone wants to learn,

04:09.999 --> 04:13.294
don't you teachers
have some kind of moral obligation?

04:14.420 --> 04:17.048
Well, as much as I hate to say it,
you're right.

04:17.131 --> 04:20.134
As an educator,
I have no choice but to help.

04:20.718 --> 04:24.847
I don't remember if I took an actual oath,
but I can't imagine that I didn't.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.647
Morning, all.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.940
Study hard, Lucky.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.485
Whatever you do,
don't correct her Spanish.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.155
Okay, let's get started.

04:41.739 --> 04:42.573
My name is...

04:42.657 --> 04:45.076
Aw, you don't have to write that,
Aunt Peggy.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.494
I'll remember your name.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.080
Mrs. Hill.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.165
I prefer to keep things formal.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.043
Hello, teacher.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.753
Hello, student.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.131
How's my boy doing so far?

04:58.464 --> 05:02.844
Maybe we should schedule
a girlfriend-teacher conference.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.639
That's real funny, baby girl.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.599
I'm dating a regular Fozzie Bear.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.517
Aw...

05:09.600 --> 05:10.768
<i>Escucha</i> me.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.978
We are starting now.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.229
Bye.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.149
Okay, Lucky, the first thing we need to do

05:16.232 --> 05:18.943
is work on
your reading comprehension skills.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.947
<i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>
by Mark Twain.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.616
Your homework is to read
the first 50 pages,

05:25.700 --> 05:27.035
which we will discuss tomorrow.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.579
Hope it's okay with you,
but I already done that.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.456
Luanne mentioned we were gonna read it.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.832
Oh.

05:32.915 --> 05:36.502
Now, I get the feeling that the river
ain't just a river.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.838
Like it's supposed to represent something.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.423
Am I way off base here?

05:41.966 --> 05:43.801
Let me just refresh myself.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.973
<i>No whammies. No whammies.
No whammies!</i>

05:49.057 --> 05:51.309
Ugh. Game Show Network.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.104
Yep.

05:55.855 --> 05:56.731
Yep.

05:56.814 --> 05:57.690
Mm-hmm.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.569
I got drunk last night,
called in to the Jewelry Channel again.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.447
They put me on the air,
and I ended up crying.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.824
I bought a ring for Peggy.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.659
Shh. Shh. Shh.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.412
Hey, Peggy. So how's it going with Lucky?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.289
Not as bad as I thought it would.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.417
Did you know he'll be the first person
in his whole family

06:16.501 --> 06:17.752
to get a high school diploma?

06:17.835 --> 06:19.003
Well, how about that?

06:19.087 --> 06:21.089
I'll bet he gets a job before you know it.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.008
Yeah. Maybe he'll get a job
far away from here...

06:24.300 --> 06:26.135
Like China.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.262
God knows, he loves imitating them.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.183
Lesson number four:

06:32.266 --> 06:34.352
The Civil War. Now...

06:34.435 --> 06:37.355
If all the soldiers
who died at the Battle of Gettysburg

06:37.438 --> 06:39.148
were laid end to end,

06:39.232 --> 06:42.235
they'd stretch all the way
from here to the moon.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.278
Wow.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.738
When you see it like this,

06:45.822 --> 06:48.699
you really get a sense
of the enormity of it all.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.284
Hey, this one here looks like me.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.662
How's that for a <i>Twilight Zone?</i>

06:56.040 --> 06:57.875
We'll just call this one
the unknown soldier.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.378
No, Aunt Peggy.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.131
I broke it, I gotta buy it.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.133
Lucky, forget it.
No one's ever gonna know.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.342
I'll know.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.137
In my family, we live by a code.

07:09.220 --> 07:13.724
We don't steal, and if we make
a promise, we damn well keep it.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.893
That's why I wanna get my GED.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.980
And once you get that,
you'll be able to get a job anywhere.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.691
You know where the economy's
really booming?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.900
China.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.237
No, Aunt Peggy, I don't want my GED
to get a job.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.114
-You don't?
-No, ma'am.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.949
Getting my high school degree is just

07:30.032 --> 07:32.910
a little personal milestone
I have to pass.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.496
Once I get that, I'll be good enough.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.998
Good enough for what?

07:37.081 --> 07:39.417
Good enough to ask Luanne to marry me.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.963
Don't worry, Aunt Peggy. That one's on me.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.638
You know, some people like
to keep this stuff on for flavor.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.891
We won't be eating at their houses.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.767
Hank, you are not listening to me.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.853
Lucky is planning to marry Luanne.

07:58.936 --> 08:02.148
I know you don't think much of Lucky,
but to tell you the truth,

08:02.231 --> 08:04.817
he's a lot better than some of the guys
she's dated.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.654
He's got no prison record,
he always pays back shaving cream,

08:08.738 --> 08:10.781
and he's, uh... he's, uh...

08:12.283 --> 08:14.994
Well, that's all I can think of, I guess.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.581
You don't understand.
Luanne has so much potential.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.083
But she's not gonna get anywhere
with that freakin'...

08:23.836 --> 08:27.924
Really? So you're saying people
actually keep this guck on?

08:28.007 --> 08:31.177
Oh, yeah. Personally, I think
it's an excuse to be lazy.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.803
A grill is meant...

08:32.887 --> 08:35.139
The man is an anchor
around her neck, Hank.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.767
Oh, we're not really
talking about the grill.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.269
Did you know he doesn't
even plan on getting a job?

08:40.353 --> 08:43.439
He just wants the GED
for his stupid code of honor.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.400
Education for education's sake.
What a waste.

08:47.151 --> 08:49.237
Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.614
Maybe Lucky won't even pass the test.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.699
Oh, of course, he'll pass the test.

08:53.783 --> 08:54.825
These things are designed

08:54.909 --> 08:57.119
so that even a high school dropout
can pass them.

08:57.995 --> 08:58.871
Unless...

08:59.372 --> 09:01.874
I purposely taught him
the wrong information.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.877
-You know you can't do that, right?
-I know.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.921
Ugh, I just wish that loser would...

09:08.965 --> 09:11.801
So if the guck stays on
long enough, will it...

09:11.884 --> 09:13.094
I'm not an idiot.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.305
I know when you say "guck"
you really mean...

09:17.098 --> 09:18.432
divorce?

09:20.184 --> 09:21.143
Crack?

09:21.811 --> 09:22.812
Condoms.

09:26.774 --> 09:30.111
So, Lucky wants to propose to Luanne.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.279
It's weird, Hank.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.364
I always thought you'd be
the next to get married...

09:33.447 --> 09:35.658
after you left Peggy, of course.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.744
Does this mean Lucky's
gonna take my place at Thanksgiving?

09:38.828 --> 09:40.538
I know how many folding chairs you have.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.165
Yeah, well, Peggy sure doesn't like Lucky.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.210
But he's really not such a bad guy
when you get right down to it.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.211
Oh, yeah.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.672
Lucky just who you want in your gene pool.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.259
Your family going to evolve backwards
into fish.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.683
Okay, the square root of 16 is four.

10:00.766 --> 10:04.395
-The square root of 25 is five.
-Excuse me, Aunt Peggy.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.733
Aw, Baby Doll, you don't need to do that.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.026
Yuh-huh.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.402
You need to study.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.530
Besides, I like cleaning stuff for you.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.490
Ooh.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.913
Lucky, you know how I said
the square root of 25 is five?

11:03.996 --> 11:06.582
-Yes, ma'am.
-It's also six.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.669
Really? So a number
can have two square roots?

11:09.752 --> 11:10.628
That's weird.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.798
Yep. There are all sorts
of weird things in math.

11:14.215 --> 11:20.304
For example, did you know that any number
multiplied by itself is zero?

11:21.722 --> 11:23.474
There's just so much to remember.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.644
Do you think I can learn all this
in time for the big test?

11:26.727 --> 11:27.978
I hope so.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.855
Now, two times two?

11:30.773 --> 11:31.816
Zero.

11:32.608 --> 11:33.734
Very good.

11:36.070 --> 11:39.240
Okay, name the three states of matter.

11:39.323 --> 11:42.618
Solid, liquid, and gel.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.120
Correct. Yeah.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.039
Wait a minute, that doesn't sound right.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.624
Ahh...

11:48.708 --> 11:50.501
I think it is, Bobby.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.920
It's right here on one
of Aunt Peggy's flashcards.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.339
-But, Mom, I thought...
-Bobby, fire drill.

11:55.423 --> 11:59.260
Come on. Drop and roll.
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.137
You can do it, Bobby. Good boy.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.972
Come on, little man. Yeah, turn it.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.020
Pi r squared...

12:10.688 --> 12:12.565
Now what's the value of pi again?

12:13.023 --> 12:13.941
Oh, right.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.609
90210.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.320
Stupid idiot.
You just gave away the answer.

12:19.905 --> 12:20.865
Mine.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.745
Okay,

12:25.828 --> 12:27.455
I know the piece I want.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.875
It should start
at the corner, wrap around this rose,

12:30.958 --> 12:33.669
then double back
to get the "L" from Lucky.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.088
-Mom, are you listening?
-Huh?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.007
He's here.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.008
He's here.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.343
I couldn't find a graduation hat,

12:41.427 --> 12:44.930
so I glued Dad's Willie Nelson
album to the dog bowl.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.515
Eh?

12:46.599 --> 12:50.144
Yeah, maybe we should hold off
until he opens up his test results.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.938
Oh, and Luanne,
why don't you fold that banner up nicely

12:53.022 --> 12:55.274
just in case you need to return it.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.861
Hey, everybody, moment of truth is here.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.409
I...

13:06.118 --> 13:08.204
-failed.
-What?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.503
I don't understand.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.338
Well, that's probably why you failed.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.756
But don't beat yourself up.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.591
Some things just aren't meant to be.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.885
Well, at least you tried, Lucky.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.846
For a lot of coaches these days,
that would be enough.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.226
Hey, <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> is probably on now.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.102
It could be a Woolery.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.565
I know you're sad right now, Lucky,

13:36.649 --> 13:40.319
but I think I could tell you something
that will cheer you up.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.655
No, I don't think so.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.907
Oh, I think so.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.410
Okay, everybody, I'm pregnant.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.165
-Hooray.
-Well, how-dee.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.919
You were right, baby girl,
that did put a smile on my face.

13:57.002 --> 14:00.089
When did this happen?
Did this happen here?

14:00.172 --> 14:01.465
It better not have happened here.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.634
Isn't this great?

14:03.717 --> 14:07.221
Now we can start a family and get married.

14:07.304 --> 14:11.475
Whoa, whoa, let's just rip the needle
off that record right now.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.769
But I'm not playing a record.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.105
I'll start a family with you, Luanne,

14:16.188 --> 14:19.608
even shack up with you,
but I made a promise.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.652
Without my GED,

14:21.735 --> 14:24.530
I ain't good enough to marry you, no way.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.781
I just can't.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.831
I'm gonna be sick,

14:33.914 --> 14:36.417
and I don't mean "baby sick."

14:37.459 --> 14:40.170
Oh, no.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.465
Oh, God, I've let us all down.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.012
Oh, Lucky.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.106
What do you mean you can't marry me?

14:59.189 --> 15:00.983
Yeah, what do you mean
you can't marry her?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.611
Bobby, get Mommy a cold towel
and a bourbon.

15:03.986 --> 15:08.782
Luanne, you know I've wanted to marry you
ever since I first set eyes on you,

15:08.866 --> 15:11.243
but I had to prove that I was worthy,

15:11.327 --> 15:14.747
which means having a high school diploma
under my arm.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.916
Heck, I always thought I'd say my vows

15:16.999 --> 15:20.044
wearing one of them black judge robes
and a flat hat.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.796
I don't care if you wear
Bobby's dog bowl hat

15:22.880 --> 15:24.632
and my bathrobe, you're gonna marry her.

15:24.715 --> 15:29.303
I know that at times it can be hard
to wrap your head around the code,

15:29.386 --> 15:32.139
but trust me, it's all for the best.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.519
This is ridiculous.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.688
-Well, maybe Lucky has a point.
-Huh?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.482
Well, I know it's not how we did it,

15:41.565 --> 15:44.860
but plenty of people have kids
without being married these days.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.654
You know, keeps things casual.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.905
Casual?

15:47.988 --> 15:49.990
Thanks for being my teacher, Aunt Peggy.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.909
I wish I was a better student.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.328
How could you not want them married?

15:54.411 --> 15:55.579
They want to be together.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.831
Look, Hank, it's gonna be hard enough
for Luanne

15:57.915 --> 16:00.250
to reach her potential
while caring for a baby.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.753
She does not need Lucky
weighing her down, too.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.254
Weighing her down?

16:04.338 --> 16:08.258
Look, I don't think having Lucky around
as a husband and father

16:08.342 --> 16:12.596
is gonna hurt Luanne's chances
to become an astronaut or a brain surgeon.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.307
We just need to make
the best of a bad situation

16:15.391 --> 16:17.267
and help those two get married.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.857
Damn it, Bobby, where's Mommy's bourbon?

16:25.818 --> 16:29.571
Hey, maybe they'll name the baby Dennis
after where he was conceived...

16:30.030 --> 16:32.533
-your den.
-Shut up, Dale.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.037
So when's the wedding, Hank?
Is it before or after the baby shower?

16:37.121 --> 16:39.665
There's, uh, not gonna be a wedding.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.750
Lucky won't marry Luanne.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.878
It's got something to do
with his weird code of honor.

16:44.962 --> 16:45.921
And you bought that?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.756
Well, according to my code of honor,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.509
I can't return the jigsaw
I borrowed from you.

16:51.593 --> 16:55.014
Yes, I broke into your garage.
That's part of my code, too.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.226
What kind of code of honor
makes you return

16:59.309 --> 17:01.061
a baggie of shaving cream

17:01.145 --> 17:03.605
but won't let you marry a girl
you got pregnant?

17:06.316 --> 17:08.110
I recognize that walk.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.113
Somewhere there's an ass
that's about to be kicked.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.161
Well, at least I won't need to buy shoes.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.704
The baby can wear mine.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.206
My mama was smart enough
to dip 'em in bronze

17:21.290 --> 17:22.332
so they'd keep.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.669
Oh, sug, your little one is not gonna be
walking around in metal shoes.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.671
We're gonna throw you
a big ol' baby shower.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.923
-Make sure you get everything you need.
-Really?

17:30.007 --> 17:32.551
Yes, and you'll fall in love again.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.262
Single mothers are very popular
on the dating circuit.

17:35.345 --> 17:37.723
As a matter of fact, <i>Us</i> magazine says

17:37.806 --> 17:40.267
that babies have replaced
those little portable rat dogs

17:40.350 --> 17:42.144
as the newest fashion accessory.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.730
Yeah, there are plenty of other fish
in the sea.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.275
Fish with jobs, fish who won't bail
when they knock you up.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.527
But I don't want another fish.

17:50.986 --> 17:51.904
I want Lucky.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.406
Even though Lucky is his name,

17:54.490 --> 17:57.284
I always considered myself
to be the lucky one.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.788
Hmm. Whenever we went to the mall
and someone would yell,

18:00.871 --> 18:03.457
"Hey, Lucky." we'd both turn around.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.712
Luanne, I'm sorry.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.924
Sug, you have nothing to be sorry for.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.383
You tried to tutor that boy,

18:13.467 --> 18:15.469
but there's just some things
a monkey cannot learn.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.471
Thanks for trying, Aunt Peggy.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.973
I know you did everything you could.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.478
I say you're gonna marry her.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.438
And I say I ain't good enough.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.898
And I say...

18:27.981 --> 18:29.483
yes, you are.

18:29.566 --> 18:30.567
You do?

18:30.651 --> 18:34.113
I'm not gonna lie to you, Lucky,
even though I've lied to you before.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.077
I have never been thrilled with you
dating my niece.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.163
I did not think you could help her
reach her potential,

18:43.622 --> 18:46.583
but all I really want
is for her to be happy.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.753
I want you to marry Luanne.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.339
-No, it's just not...
-I know, I know,

18:52.422 --> 18:54.216
your family's freakin' code of honor.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.801
Maybe this will change your mind.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.762
I intentionally made you fail that test.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.932
-You did what?
-Yeah, yeah, I was wrong. I get it.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.433
Lucky, I sabotaged you.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.936
You would've passed if it weren't for me.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.272
Probably by the skin
of your broken little teeth,

19:08.355 --> 19:09.356
but you would have passed.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.276
I don't believe you.
Your code of honor wouldn't allow it.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.736
Code of honor?
I don't have a code of honor.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.113
Who the hell has a code of honor?

19:17.364 --> 19:18.532
I have a code of honor.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.202
I wish there was some way around this,
but there ain't.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.246
God knows I wish there was,

19:24.329 --> 19:27.624
but a man that breaks his code
is no kind of man.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.548
Wait. Now, you said you would
have been the first person in your family

19:34.631 --> 19:36.967
-to graduate high school, right?
-True.

19:37.050 --> 19:41.305
Well, then how did any of them get married
if they all had this family code of honor.

19:41.388 --> 19:45.225
Oh, a high school education
wasn't part of their code.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.269
My father said he wouldn't marry

19:47.352 --> 19:51.064
till he became the undisputed
heavyweight champion of the world.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.984
Your dad was the heavyweight champion
of the world?

19:54.067 --> 19:57.988
No, he could never make the weight
or take a punch to the jaw.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.448
And my grandpappy said

19:59.531 --> 20:02.159
he wouldn't marry
till he spoke perfect French.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.912
I'm guessing grandpappy
never got past <i>bonjour.</i>

20:04.995 --> 20:05.829
Nope.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.207
Then how the heck
did any of them get married?

20:08.290 --> 20:13.086
Uh, Hank, I think what we're looking at
is the last of a long line of bastards.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.713
Oh, they all got married,

20:14.796 --> 20:17.090
but those were all shotgun weddings.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.178
So they didn't have a choice
in the matter.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.936
Luanne Leeanne Platter...

20:30.354 --> 20:32.940
would you make me
the happiest man in the...

20:33.273 --> 20:35.734
Hold on. Is that gun cocked?

20:35.817 --> 20:37.110
It's got to be cocked.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.946
I'm not gonna cock it.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.407
Okay, I'm in no position to make demands.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.159
Luanne...

20:44.785 --> 20:47.120
I'd like you to be my bride.

20:47.704 --> 20:51.291
Oh, Lucky, yes, yes, yes.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.795
Ya-hoo!

20:55.379 --> 20:56.213
Just a second.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.799
Uncle Hank,
now you got to kick me in the ribs.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.300
Come on. This is ridiculous.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.594
I said I'd hold the gun, but...

21:02.678 --> 21:04.554
Welcome to the family, Lucky.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.144
-<i>No whammies. No whammies.</i>
<i>No whammies!</i>
