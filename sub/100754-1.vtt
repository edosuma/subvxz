02:32.645 --> 02:34.914
Michele, Michele.

02:35.782 --> 02:37.917
Miss me, miss me, miss me?

02:37.950 --> 02:40.219
What do you want from me?

02:42.255 --> 02:45.892
Michele,
Michele, Michele.

02:45.925 --> 02:47.627
Join me.

02:54.499 --> 02:55.400
Michele, Michele!

02:56.535 --> 02:58.204
I'm right here.

02:58.237 --> 02:59.739
Calm down.

02:59.772 --> 03:01.707
Oh, no, no, no, I don't
wanna go back to sleep.

03:01.741 --> 03:03.109
No, please, no.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.342
Everything's
gonna be all right.

03:04.376 --> 03:05.377
No, please.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.914
Calm down, take deep breaths.

04:08.641 --> 04:09.642
Dr. Flanagan.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.378
Good morning, Detective.

04:13.411 --> 04:14.814
How's she doing?

04:14.847 --> 04:17.350
Well, physically
there's nothing wrong.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.619
However, she is still
suffering from PTSD.

04:20.653 --> 04:23.923
Oh, I know all about post
traumatic stress disorder,

04:23.956 --> 04:26.524
but it has been a week
and she's the only one

04:26.558 --> 04:27.960
that can provide us answers.

04:29.362 --> 04:31.831
Keep it short and avoid
going out of her comfort zone.

04:31.864 --> 04:32.965
- Got it.
- All right.

04:32.999 --> 04:34.399
- Thanks so much.
- Mm-hmm.

04:35.902 --> 04:37.502
So I'll bring in some pizza?

04:42.607 --> 04:46.245
Detective, does the
doctor know you're here?

04:46.279 --> 04:48.814
Yes, Mrs. Chadwick,
I have his approval.

04:49.749 --> 04:50.582
Hi, Michele.

04:52.051 --> 04:55.788
I'm sorry to bother you but I
do need to get your statement.

04:55.821 --> 04:57.924
Oh, Dr. Flanagan.

04:57.957 --> 04:59.659
Don't you think it's
too early for Michele

04:59.692 --> 05:01.727
to be talking about this?

05:01.761 --> 05:03.296
Well, as I mentioned
to the detective,

05:03.329 --> 05:04.897
she needs to keep it short

05:04.931 --> 05:06.866
and not exceed what
Michele can handle.

05:08.801 --> 05:11.404
I'm gonna record
your statement now.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.239
Please state your
full name and age.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.148
Michele Chadwick, 22.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.186
It's okay, just
take your time.

05:27.219 --> 05:28.821
Tell me everything you remember.

05:31.357 --> 05:32.959
Where do you want me to start?

05:36.662 --> 05:39.131
Why don't you start at
the beginning of the trip?

05:43.336 --> 05:44.904
Okay, well we had
been talking about

05:44.937 --> 05:47.340
this camping trip
for like a few weeks.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.411
And the night before,
Sophia and I...

05:52.445 --> 05:56.215
Yo, this list reminds me
of when we were at camp

05:56.248 --> 05:57.650
and they would tell
us to bring stuff.

05:57.683 --> 05:59.652
That was my idea.

05:59.685 --> 06:01.187
That's where I got
the inspiration from.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.089
Besides, I've trying to make
it simple for all the guys.

06:03.122 --> 06:05.791
Oh, what do you
expect, they're jocks.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.893
One of us happens to be
dating one of those jocks.

06:07.927 --> 06:10.696
You know what, Travis
is the exception.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.564
He's got brains,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.835
- amongst other things.
- Ugh.

06:15.868 --> 06:17.703
And you're right, I really
shouldn't be judging them.

06:17.737 --> 06:20.373
Yeah, especially somebody
who's a psychology major.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.978
Text from Rachel.

06:26.012 --> 06:28.814
"I can't make it tonight,
see you in the morning."

06:28.848 --> 06:30.850
Thanks for the
short notice, Rachel.

06:32.284 --> 06:34.619
I knew she was gonna do
that so I packed extra.

06:36.122 --> 06:38.824
"Okay, see you tomorrow."

06:38.858 --> 06:41.994
You know, this is you and
all your animal lover stuff.

06:42.028 --> 06:44.964
Hey, animal lovers
can't be animal eaters.

06:44.997 --> 06:47.233
Oh, so you're calling
me animal hater?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.001
Maybe.

06:52.772 --> 06:54.707
Dude, I'm so excited
for this trip.

06:55.808 --> 06:58.610
You know, hot
springs, the pines,

06:58.644 --> 07:00.679
getting all of us together.

07:00.713 --> 07:04.650
Yeah, I know, and
you got marshmallows.

07:05.651 --> 07:07.953
Lots and lots of marshmallows.

07:09.355 --> 07:10.723
Of course.

07:10.756 --> 07:12.091
More marshmallows.

07:13.426 --> 07:15.294
More animal-free stuff.

07:15.327 --> 07:18.864
You're stupid.

07:43.055 --> 07:43.956
Hey.

07:43.989 --> 07:45.623
Hope I got these right.

07:45.658 --> 07:47.326
Morning, sunshine.

07:47.359 --> 07:48.828
Thank you, Travis.

07:48.861 --> 07:49.962
Sorry about last night, guys.

07:49.995 --> 07:51.931
I had to close up shop.

07:51.964 --> 07:54.400
We're just glad
you could make it.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.868
Did you forget something?

07:55.901 --> 07:57.837
There's more in the back.

08:04.343 --> 08:06.812
Well, I think I got everything.

08:06.846 --> 08:09.215
So, Travis, how many
footballers are coming?

08:10.382 --> 08:13.085
Girl, you did not just
call them footballers.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.289
You wanna mingle, you
need to know the lingo.

08:17.323 --> 08:19.692
They're called soccer players.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.080
What's up, chaps?

08:41.113 --> 08:42.348
Hey, guys.

08:42.381 --> 08:44.550
Okay, guys, quick
intro for Rachel.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.785
This is Nate, he's
in two of my classes.

08:46.819 --> 08:48.020
Yep, that's me.

08:48.053 --> 08:48.888
EnchantÃ©.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.760
Okay and this is
Brandon and Jessica.

08:54.793 --> 08:56.328
Brandon's also on the
team and Jessica--

08:56.362 --> 08:57.631
Is his girlfriend.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.964
Ah.

08:58.998 --> 09:01.600
Definitely see you
guys are a couple.

09:01.635 --> 09:05.004
Good, so then there shouldn't
be any misunderstandings.

09:05.037 --> 09:07.239
No, no misunderstanding
here, sweetie.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.878
So, what is this
place we're going to?

09:14.280 --> 09:15.581
Beckon Falls.

10:16.275 --> 10:18.444
I actually was on
SNL for like a minute.

10:18.477 --> 10:19.311
Who?

10:21.046 --> 10:22.081
Who was?

10:35.361 --> 10:36.195
14 miles?

10:36.228 --> 10:37.930
Hey, you can do it.

10:37.963 --> 10:39.265
Of course, I'll be fine.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.035
I don't like the way that
blonde bitch looks at you.

10:43.068 --> 10:44.970
Yeah, well, be
nice Jess, all right?

10:51.277 --> 10:52.278
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

10:52.311 --> 10:53.812
How you holding up?

10:53.846 --> 10:57.249
Between Pilates and Cardio
Barre, I can walk all day.

10:57.283 --> 10:58.718
You all right?

10:58.752 --> 11:01.186
Why does everyone think
I can't walk this far?

11:01.220 --> 11:02.988
Okay, sensitive.

11:03.022 --> 11:04.990
You don't do that
much hiking, do you?

11:05.024 --> 11:06.225
It shows?

11:06.258 --> 11:08.260
Well, for one, the
pack is too heavy.

11:08.294 --> 11:10.462
I thought it seemed
a little bit big

11:10.496 --> 11:13.565
but I just brought whatever
Sophia told me to bring.

11:13.599 --> 11:14.933
Uh huh.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.568
Here, let's trade.

11:16.602 --> 11:19.238
I think I can handle
yours better than you can.

11:19.271 --> 11:21.173
- You sure?
- It's okay.

11:24.376 --> 11:27.446
Yours is so much
lighter than mine.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.215
Last time I went fishing
and hiking and camping,

11:30.249 --> 11:32.051
I was in the Boy Scouts.

11:32.084 --> 11:33.052
So you were?

11:33.085 --> 11:34.386
Yeah, since I was 10.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.321
Cute.

12:00.179 --> 12:03.683
All right, the directions
point to the right.

12:03.717 --> 12:05.384
But that doesn't make any sense.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.219
Like, that road looks
like its going back down

12:07.252 --> 12:08.887
- the way we came.
- Just give me the directions.

12:18.765 --> 12:20.800
That's weird, I
can't get a signal.

12:20.834 --> 12:23.402
Oh, I forgot to mention,
there's no cell service out here.

12:23.435 --> 12:25.003
Even I knew that.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.442
The lake is supposed to
be at a higher elevation.

12:30.476 --> 12:32.277
That road leads down.

12:32.311 --> 12:34.146
Look, on the soccer field,
you might be team captain

12:34.179 --> 12:35.648
but this is my turf

12:35.682 --> 12:37.249
and I don't need some
stupid map, it's obvious.

12:37.282 --> 12:38.752
Hey, chill out, dude!

12:38.785 --> 12:39.786
This isn't a competition.

12:39.819 --> 12:41.286
I know what I'm doing!

12:41.320 --> 12:43.355
If Sophia's cousin says to
go right, we're going right!

12:43.389 --> 12:45.591
Okay, easy boys.

12:45.624 --> 12:48.594
Come on, what Brandon
says makes sense.

12:48.628 --> 12:50.028
Okay, let's just
follow the directions

12:50.062 --> 12:51.397
and if we don't start
heading upwards,

12:51.430 --> 12:53.298
we'll turn back around.

12:53.332 --> 12:54.667
Okay?

12:54.701 --> 12:55.501
All right.

12:56.502 --> 12:57.369
You heard the boss.

12:58.504 --> 12:59.672
Let's go.

13:14.186 --> 13:16.522
Nate, are you sure you
don't mind carrying my stuff?

13:16.555 --> 13:17.589
Yo, I got it.

13:17.623 --> 13:19.224
All right, you're a lifesaver.

13:19.258 --> 13:20.392
Hey, no problem.

13:20.426 --> 13:21.927
Hey, I see you
brought a mini rod.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.162
Yeah, of course.

13:23.195 --> 13:25.330
She told me there's
a great fishing spot.

13:25.364 --> 13:26.331
What?

13:26.365 --> 13:28.200
Oh, that's cool.

13:28.233 --> 13:30.569
I always thought there was
something different about you.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.171
Maybe you could show
me how to catch a few?

13:32.204 --> 13:33.405
Yeah, for sure.

13:56.528 --> 13:59.833
All right, guys,
let's take a break.

13:59.866 --> 14:00.700
Finally.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.771
I'm sure it'll start
going up hill again soon.

14:04.804 --> 14:06.104
How far do you
think we've come?

14:06.138 --> 14:07.606
Should be about halfway.

14:09.508 --> 14:10.342
Hey.

14:13.278 --> 14:14.480
I'm sorry.

14:14.513 --> 14:15.748
For what?

14:15.782 --> 14:18.116
For being short
with you earlier.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.719
You're a tough little cookie.

14:19.752 --> 14:21.253
I know you can handle it.

14:22.221 --> 14:24.691
Guys?

14:24.724 --> 14:26.659
I see some anger in the clouds.

14:26.693 --> 14:28.260
It's not looking good.

14:28.293 --> 14:30.663
Yeah, we should probably
start pulling out our rain gear.

14:36.235 --> 14:37.236
Hey, look over there.

14:37.269 --> 14:38.838
Is that a building?

14:45.912 --> 14:47.981
Yeah, that's a
house all right.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.949
Looks abandoned though.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.150
Let's check it out.

14:54.821 --> 14:55.655
Come on.

15:19.812 --> 15:22.247
What's this place doing here?

15:46.438 --> 15:47.774
All right, move.

15:53.512 --> 15:54.313
I'm going in.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.248
Are you nuts?

16:02.889 --> 16:04.389
Well, all right.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.658
Yep.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.805
Well, there's no electricity.

16:18.838 --> 16:20.539
It's all right, we'll survive.

16:20.572 --> 16:21.841
Yeah we will.

16:23.241 --> 16:25.243
Why do you guys
think it's abandoned?

16:25.277 --> 16:27.546
Who cares, it's ours now.

16:35.088 --> 16:36.089
You say something?

16:38.423 --> 16:40.425
I didn't say anything.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.563
How convenient.

16:47.634 --> 16:48.768
Woo!

16:50.737 --> 16:53.640
Guys, guys, guys.

16:53.673 --> 16:55.842
A little elbow grease and
this place will be good as new.

18:46.351 --> 18:47.687
There you are.

18:49.989 --> 18:51.858
What the hell is that?

18:53.926 --> 18:55.360
What?

18:55.393 --> 18:57.163
That voodoo stuff.

18:59.866 --> 19:00.700
Weird.

19:04.369 --> 19:05.171
You okay?

19:06.404 --> 19:08.040
Yeah.

19:08.074 --> 19:09.642
What you got there?

19:09.675 --> 19:10.676
What you got?

19:10.710 --> 19:11.711
I found it.

19:13.045 --> 19:14.412
- Well does it open?
- No.

19:16.149 --> 19:18.283
Okay, cool.

19:18.316 --> 19:19.952
Finders keepers.

19:23.156 --> 19:24.123
Do you hear that?

19:25.892 --> 19:26.726
Hear what?

19:31.197 --> 19:32.031
Never mind.

19:33.598 --> 19:35.768
Okay, well we're
going to start dinner.

19:35.802 --> 19:37.203
Okay, I'll be right there.

19:38.070 --> 19:38.905
Okay.

19:51.684 --> 19:52.952
Hey, did you find her?

19:52.985 --> 19:54.486
Oh yeah, she's coming.

19:54.519 --> 19:56.189
Let's just go get
dinner started.

19:59.292 --> 20:00.860
I will choke
that blonde bitch.

20:00.893 --> 20:03.262
Oh, I love it
when you get angry.

20:03.296 --> 20:04.429
I know you do.

20:04.462 --> 20:06.999
Hey!

20:07.033 --> 20:08.668
We gotta go get dinner started.

20:08.701 --> 20:10.102
Sorry, there's just something

20:10.136 --> 20:12.071
about a mountain man, you know?

20:12.104 --> 20:13.039
Okay.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.241
Come on.

20:15.274 --> 20:16.408
We will finish this later.

20:16.441 --> 20:17.243
Oh, we better.

20:17.276 --> 20:18.476
No, we won't.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.080
I'm just gonna go help
Travis out, all right?

20:31.556 --> 20:33.659
Nothing like a
bunch of busy beavers.

20:33.693 --> 20:36.095
You did not just
call us beavers.

20:36.128 --> 20:38.331
I don't think she
meant anything by that.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.266
Figure of speech.

20:40.299 --> 20:43.903
Oh, I guess I just expected
more from a college girl.

20:43.936 --> 20:46.239
Okay, you know, the beaver's
one of the most diligent

20:46.272 --> 20:48.941
and hardworking
animals on the planet.

20:48.975 --> 20:50.442
Right, Jess?

20:50.475 --> 20:51.844
Yeah, that's what I meant.

20:57.884 --> 20:59.919
Now give me something to do.

20:59.952 --> 21:00.753
Here.

21:00.786 --> 21:01.988
Do something with those.

21:21.307 --> 21:22.141
Hey.

21:24.310 --> 21:25.811
You were right about the road.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.614
We should've taken
the other one.

21:31.684 --> 21:32.484
We cool?

21:33.986 --> 21:35.354
Yeah, cool.

21:36.521 --> 21:38.456
We should head back
the other way tomorrow.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.195
You got it.

21:52.504 --> 21:53.673
Who's thirsty?

21:53.706 --> 21:54.907
Yeah!

21:56.676 --> 21:57.442
My dude.

21:59.211 --> 22:01.147
Hey, Brandon, where'd
you score that bottle?

22:01.180 --> 22:03.082
Courtesy of my pops.

22:08.321 --> 22:09.155
My dog.

22:10.189 --> 22:10.990
All right.

22:11.023 --> 22:11.857
Yeah, yeah.

22:13.993 --> 22:14.794
Oh,

22:16.028 --> 22:17.296
can you handle this?

22:18.931 --> 22:19.765
Try me.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.068
Say when.

22:23.135 --> 22:23.970
When! When!

22:27.505 --> 22:29.208
Are you trying to get me drunk?

22:29.241 --> 22:30.076
Uh.

22:35.815 --> 22:36.649
Mmmm.

22:43.089 --> 22:46.092
Have a good time over
there with Goldilocks?

22:46.125 --> 22:46.926
What?

22:48.995 --> 22:52.398
I saw you completely
undressing her with your eyes.

22:52.431 --> 22:54.166
I was just pouring some rum.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.668
Mm-hmm.

22:55.701 --> 22:57.535
Besides, the only one
I'm undressing with my eyes

22:58.437 --> 23:00.873
- is you.
- Uh huh.

23:00.906 --> 23:02.008
Hmmm? Hmmm?

23:07.780 --> 23:08.613
Shut up.

23:12.084 --> 23:13.152
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:14.353 --> 23:17.857
Hey, so, you have
a thing for Brandon?

23:17.890 --> 23:18.657
What?

23:18.691 --> 23:20.092
No way.

23:20.126 --> 23:22.028
I just like pushing
Jessica's buttons.

23:22.928 --> 23:25.197
Oh.

23:25.231 --> 23:26.065
Okay.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.968
To pushing buttons.

23:29.935 --> 23:31.771
To new friends.

23:33.605 --> 23:34.407
Yeah.

23:35.808 --> 23:36.608
Yeah.

23:37.476 --> 23:38.610
New friends.

23:46.318 --> 23:48.521
So do you still have
any energy leftover?

23:48.553 --> 23:51.457
Oh, I think I am wide awake.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.759
Oh, let me see what you got.

23:53.793 --> 23:54.592
Oh.

24:20.519 --> 24:23.689
Yo, that food was
on point tonight.

24:23.722 --> 24:24.557
Thank you.

24:25.391 --> 24:26.624
Teamwork.

24:32.898 --> 24:35.501
Is she doing that
for our benefit?

24:35.534 --> 24:36.368
Probably.

24:37.703 --> 24:39.205
That's so Jess.

24:42.508 --> 24:45.244
Hey, how about some
ghost stories or something?

24:45.277 --> 24:47.012
Oh, I love scary stories.

24:47.947 --> 24:49.215
Do you know any?

24:49.248 --> 24:53.319
No, no, no, no, I
get scared too easily.

24:53.352 --> 24:55.087
Listen to my music,
thank you very much.

24:55.955 --> 24:56.789
Fucking wuss.

24:57.923 --> 24:59.158
Well I know one.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.026
All right, well let
me know when you done.

25:02.361 --> 25:03.562
Okay, go on, go on.

25:03.596 --> 25:05.831
Just stop keeping
us in suspense.

25:05.865 --> 25:06.699
All right.

25:08.367 --> 25:12.004
There once was this
very sexy girl.

25:13.439 --> 25:15.508
Okay, why does
she have to be sexy?

25:15.541 --> 25:19.278
I mean, can't she be
intelligent or plain?

25:19.311 --> 25:21.914
Who's telling the
story, you or me?

25:21.947 --> 25:23.549
Okay, go on, tell your story.

25:24.717 --> 25:26.318
Okay.

25:26.352 --> 25:29.455
So, this intelligent and kind
of plain-looking girl, Nina,

25:29.488 --> 25:31.624
starting partying way too much.

25:31.657 --> 25:34.093
All right, you
made your point.

25:34.126 --> 25:36.595
Just tell you story
how you want it.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.330
All right.

25:38.364 --> 25:43.369
This hot chick named Nina
started partying way too much.

25:44.837 --> 25:47.506
Her grades were slipping,
so her parents grounded her.

25:47.540 --> 25:50.576
Now, if her grades improved,
they have her a second chance

25:50.609 --> 25:52.646
but with an early curfew.

25:53.812 --> 25:57.316
Now, as you can guess,
on her first night out,

25:57.349 --> 25:59.051
Nina was having such a good time

25:59.084 --> 26:01.655
that she didn't make
it back on time.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.889
And when she finally
did get home,

26:03.923 --> 26:06.592
she found all the lights out.

26:07.661 --> 26:08.928
She tried the front door,

26:09.862 --> 26:10.796
wasn't locked.

26:11.964 --> 26:14.433
So instead of just
going on inside,

26:14.466 --> 26:17.169
she went around back and
climbed the old oak tree

26:17.203 --> 26:18.437
beneath her bedroom window,

26:18.470 --> 26:20.206
as she had done so
many times before.

26:21.607 --> 26:24.376
Next morning, Nina
wakes up early.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.647
It was quiet,

26:28.781 --> 26:32.551
so she thought maybe
her folks went into town

26:32.585 --> 26:33.552
without waking her.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.889
When she reaches the
bottom of the stairs,

26:36.922 --> 26:39.592
she sees blood everywhere.

26:39.626 --> 26:40.793
She runs in the living room

26:40.826 --> 26:42.795
to find her parents'
mangled bodies.

26:42.828 --> 26:46.298
She screams when she
sees written on the walls

26:46.332 --> 26:48.334
in their blood the words,

26:49.501 --> 26:50.736
"Lucky you didn't
open the door."

26:54.540 --> 26:56.141
Asshole, you trying to
give me a heart attack?

26:56.175 --> 26:58.777
Look, I'm sorry, I
heard this story before

26:58.811 --> 27:00.212
and I thought it would be funny.

27:00.246 --> 27:02.881
Yeah, that's your
problem, you don't think.

27:02.915 --> 27:03.816
At least, not with your head.

27:03.849 --> 27:05.317
Whoa.

27:05.351 --> 27:06.819
Coming back to bed?

27:06.852 --> 27:08.120
Mmmm, in a minute.

27:10.022 --> 27:11.924
Goodnight, everyone.

27:11.957 --> 27:13.158
- Night.
- Goodnight, guys.

27:13.192 --> 27:13.993
See y'all.

27:14.026 --> 27:15.527
Well, goodnight.

27:17.162 --> 27:17.963
Night.

27:17.997 --> 27:19.398
Night, guys.

27:19.431 --> 27:20.266
Night, y'all.

27:21.668 --> 27:23.670
Hey, it's okay if you
guys want the other bedroom.

27:23.703 --> 27:26.505
Oh, it's all right, we
can just stay with you.

27:26.538 --> 27:28.407
One big slumber party.

27:41.353 --> 27:45.124
There's my personal heater.

29:15.481 --> 29:16.515
This is her weapon.

29:35.835 --> 29:39.338
Why do you hurt these
poor children of Christ?

29:39.371 --> 29:41.841
What harm have
they done unto you?

29:41.875 --> 29:43.142
I do no hurt them.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.179
Abigail Barker,

29:47.212 --> 29:50.182
you are charged with
sundry acts of witchcraft,

29:50.215 --> 29:51.617
committed unto the bodies

29:51.651 --> 29:54.687
of Mercy Lewis, Ann
Putnam and others.

29:54.721 --> 29:56.856
I'm innocent, I
know nothing of it.

29:56.890 --> 29:59.258
I have done no witchcraft.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.193
You are charged
with tempting them

30:01.226 --> 30:03.663
to sign the Devil's book.

30:03.696 --> 30:06.565
It's that said book.

30:06.598 --> 30:07.966
Tis false, I tell thee!

30:08.000 --> 30:10.068
I've done no wrong!

30:10.102 --> 30:12.839
She bears the mark
of Satan himself!

30:12.872 --> 30:13.873
It's over her heart!

30:33.992 --> 30:35.795
There is no denying.

30:36.995 --> 30:38.330
Who do you serve?

30:38.363 --> 30:39.398
I serve no one.

30:39.431 --> 30:41.333
Then you serve not our Lord.

30:41.366 --> 30:44.203
What contract have
you signed with Satan?

30:44.236 --> 30:45.939
You put words in my mouth.

30:45.971 --> 30:48.808
I have made no contract, I
never saw him in my life.

30:48.842 --> 30:52.244
Anne Putnam saith that the
devil is her god, not I.

30:53.479 --> 30:56.381
Have you not in your
heart to tell the truth?

30:56.415 --> 30:57.817
I do tell the truth.

30:57.851 --> 30:59.485
I never hurt these persons.

30:59.518 --> 31:01.688
I am no witch!

31:15.534 --> 31:18.705
Have you not given consent
that some evil spirit

31:18.738 --> 31:21.139
should do this in your likeness?

31:21.173 --> 31:22.541
No.

31:22.574 --> 31:24.309
I am innocent!

31:24.343 --> 31:27.079
All accusations
against me are false!

31:28.180 --> 31:30.082
Abigail Barker,

31:30.115 --> 31:33.185
I find you guilty
of being a witch!

31:33.218 --> 31:36.890
And I here order to proceed
with your execution!

31:36.923 --> 31:38.390
You are a liar!

31:38.423 --> 31:41.093
I am no more a witch
than you are a wizard.

31:41.126 --> 31:42.294
Take her away!

31:43.830 --> 31:45.130
You will pay for this!

31:59.511 --> 32:00.345
What's wrong?

32:02.381 --> 32:03.582
Whoa.

32:04.684 --> 32:06.618
Hey, it was just a little quake.

32:06.653 --> 32:08.021
Is she okay?

32:08.053 --> 32:09.923
- Come here, sweetheart.
- A little shaken up.

32:09.956 --> 32:13.158
Sweetheart, it was
just a little earthquake.

32:14.126 --> 32:14.961
Let's go.

32:26.806 --> 32:28.507
Hey, is she okay?

32:30.043 --> 32:31.044
Oh my God.

32:34.814 --> 32:37.416
And that's when I noticed
that her eyes had changed.

32:39.151 --> 32:40.653
Did
anyone else notice

32:40.687 --> 32:42.187
the change taking place?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.524
I don't know.

32:45.557 --> 32:47.192
It's okay, just
take your time.

32:50.029 --> 32:51.263
I don't know.

32:52.464 --> 32:53.498
I can't remember.

33:01.741 --> 33:03.943
- Honey, what is it?
- What? What?

33:03.977 --> 33:05.377
She's right there!

33:05.410 --> 33:06.545
- She's right there, Grandma!
- There's no one here!

33:06.578 --> 33:07.579
No, no, she's right there!

33:07.613 --> 33:09.114
No, she's right there!

33:09.147 --> 33:11.249
- Who did you see?
- Sophia's right there!

33:11.283 --> 33:12.284
She's right there!
She's right there!

33:12.317 --> 33:13.485
She's right there!

33:13.518 --> 33:14.754
We
don't see anything.

33:14.787 --> 33:15.855
Yes, there's, Grandma,
please save me, Grandma!

33:15.888 --> 33:16.990
You've had enough excitement.

33:17.023 --> 33:18.223
Grandma, Grandma--

33:18.256 --> 33:20.660
This has got to
stop right now.

33:20.693 --> 33:21.928
Please, Grandma, no!

33:21.961 --> 33:23.595
I'm gonna give you
something to relax.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.065
No, no, I don't wanna
go back to sleep, please!

33:26.099 --> 33:27.466
Doctor, please,
it is very pressing

33:27.499 --> 33:29.836
that we finish her statement!

33:29.869 --> 33:31.104
I understand

33:31.136 --> 33:33.138
but right now I can not
allow you to continue!

33:34.473 --> 33:36.408
All right, I'll
pick this up later.

33:37.476 --> 33:38.845
Mrs. Chadwick--

33:38.878 --> 33:41.213
Do you realize how difficult
this is for all of us?

33:41.246 --> 33:43.716
I understand that
and I respect it

33:43.750 --> 33:45.384
but its very difficult
for the other parents

33:45.417 --> 33:46.451
involved as well.

33:48.453 --> 33:49.656
I'll check back later.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.314
Damn it.

35:01.526 --> 35:02.360
Michele?

35:06.398 --> 35:07.200
Detective.

35:07.232 --> 35:08.101
Yeah.

35:09.936 --> 35:11.738
Where's my grandma?

35:11.771 --> 35:12.739
She left.

35:14.006 --> 35:15.273
So, how you feeling?

35:16.408 --> 35:17.242
Better.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.278
I don't wanna sleep anymore.

35:23.149 --> 35:24.349
You know, there's
a lot of people

35:24.382 --> 35:26.284
that wanna hear your
side of the story.

35:28.721 --> 35:30.990
I know, it's just hard.

35:32.491 --> 35:34.559
I'm not trying to keep
anything from you.

35:36.696 --> 35:37.529
That's good.

35:38.965 --> 35:41.667
I just want to find out what
happened to your friends.

35:41.701 --> 35:43.236
You ready to continue our talk?

35:45.138 --> 35:46.739
- Okay.
- All right.

35:47.907 --> 35:48.908
So,

35:48.941 --> 35:49.942
what happened next?

35:52.277 --> 35:53.780
Well, we were sleeping

35:55.347 --> 35:56.783
and then, in the morning...

35:58.316 --> 36:00.887
You guys, there's no
sign of her out there.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.122
Guys, I found her hair

36:03.156 --> 36:04.724
with blood all over it.

36:05.925 --> 36:08.060
You think somebody
kidnapped her?

36:08.094 --> 36:09.829
Why would they only take her?

36:09.862 --> 36:11.097
I don't know

36:11.130 --> 36:12.231
but we've searched
this whole house.

36:13.331 --> 36:14.801
Guys, I'm really scared.

36:14.834 --> 36:16.803
Come on, guys, this is
Sophia we're talking about.

36:16.836 --> 36:19.238
She had to leave
on her own accord.

36:19.272 --> 36:21.741
But why didn't she tell anyone?

36:21.774 --> 36:24.476
And where did all
that blood come from?

36:24.509 --> 36:25.544
That time of the month?

36:25.577 --> 36:26.779
Don't mess around.

36:26.813 --> 36:28.613
Okay, guys, listen up.

36:28.648 --> 36:29.882
We're all gonna
split into groups

36:29.916 --> 36:31.150
and we'll search for her
in different directions.

36:31.184 --> 36:32.852
It's the fastest
way to find her.

36:34.519 --> 36:36.122
I'll head back down the trail.

36:37.190 --> 36:38.658
I'll go with Brandon.

36:38.691 --> 36:40.893
Good, then Michele and I can
search the trail to the east

36:40.927 --> 36:43.162
and maybe Nate and Rachel
can search to the west.

36:43.196 --> 36:44.697
If we can't get any signal,

36:44.730 --> 36:46.098
how are we supposed to get
in touch with each other?

36:46.132 --> 36:47.599
When you guys do find her,

36:47.633 --> 36:49.035
just have one
person stay with her

36:49.068 --> 36:50.736
and the other person head back.

36:50.770 --> 36:52.238
And no matter what,

36:52.271 --> 36:55.274
we're all gonna meet right back
here in one hour, all right?

36:56.809 --> 36:57.710
One hour.

36:59.245 --> 37:00.146
Let's go.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.113
Let's go.

37:03.716 --> 37:04.817
Sophia!

37:04.851 --> 37:05.685
Sophia!

37:06.686 --> 37:08.020
Sophia!

37:08.054 --> 37:08.888
Sophia!

37:10.690 --> 37:11.991
Sophia!

37:17.763 --> 37:18.931
Sophia!

37:18.965 --> 37:19.799
Sophia!

37:22.668 --> 37:23.501
Sophia?

37:24.502 --> 37:25.805
Where you at?

37:25.838 --> 37:26.672
Sophia!

37:32.144 --> 37:33.545
There's no sight of her.

37:33.578 --> 37:36.282
I don't get it, she's
disappeared without a trace.

37:36.315 --> 37:38.516
I don't understand
where she could have gone.

37:40.518 --> 37:41.854
Let's keep looking for her.

37:49.795 --> 37:52.064
Hey, aren't
we at the crossroads?

37:52.098 --> 37:52.932
Yeah.

37:54.233 --> 37:55.067
Sophia!

38:00.773 --> 38:02.275
Do you feel that?

38:02.308 --> 38:03.441
Feel what?

38:03.475 --> 38:06.078
It feels like
someone's watching us.

38:10.482 --> 38:11.984
No, you're imagining things.

38:17.555 --> 38:18.691
Did you hear that?

38:18.724 --> 38:19.557
Yeah.

38:21.027 --> 38:22.728
I think it came from over here.

38:22.762 --> 38:23.561
Come on.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.601
Shit!

38:29.635 --> 38:30.870
Brandon!

38:35.308 --> 38:36.142
Ugh.

38:37.777 --> 38:39.679
Well I didn't expect that.

38:39.712 --> 38:41.681
Are you okay?

38:41.714 --> 38:42.614
I'm okay.

38:45.483 --> 38:46.319
Christ.

38:49.689 --> 38:51.257
I got you.

39:32.698 --> 39:34.100
Is that Sophia?

39:35.234 --> 39:37.136
Yeah, I think so.

39:37.169 --> 39:38.671
- Sophia!
- Sophia!

39:43.909 --> 39:44.910
Oh my God.

39:50.116 --> 39:52.752
Did she dig this with her hands?

39:52.785 --> 39:53.618
Sophia?

39:54.754 --> 39:56.288
Sophia, what's come over you?

39:57.522 --> 39:58.791
Sophia.

39:58.824 --> 39:59.825
Yo, it's me.

40:01.293 --> 40:02.128
Nate.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.102
Yo, her hands are like ice.

40:35.461 --> 40:36.695
Stop that!

40:36.729 --> 40:39.965
Stop that, what
is wrong with you?

40:39.999 --> 40:41.867
Sweetie, please just relax.

40:41.901 --> 40:43.436
It's okay, just get some sleep.

40:47.339 --> 40:48.507
Is she breathing?

40:54.647 --> 40:56.248
Is she breathing?

40:59.218 --> 41:02.421
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know, I don't know.

41:02.455 --> 41:04.223
We need to get the
hell out of her.

41:19.004 --> 41:20.406
How is she?

41:20.439 --> 41:21.640
I don't know.

41:21.674 --> 41:23.342
There's something
wrong with her, okay?

41:23.375 --> 41:25.244
She's acting very strange.

41:25.277 --> 41:27.113
Yeah, she's lost her mind.

41:27.146 --> 41:29.148
We caught her digging a
whole with her bare hands.

41:29.181 --> 41:30.850
Brandon, don't say that.

41:30.883 --> 41:34.887
I mean, she's probably delusional
from the flu or something.

41:34.920 --> 41:39.925
First she finds a necklace,
then her eyes turn all weird.

41:41.127 --> 41:42.828
Now she digs this
book out of a hole.

41:42.862 --> 41:44.897
I mean, she's gotta
be a little crazy.

41:46.298 --> 41:48.567
I can't even read a
word in this book.

41:48.601 --> 41:50.136
It's English.

41:50.169 --> 41:51.504
I know that, you bimbo.

41:51.537 --> 41:53.339
Fuck you, bitch.

41:53.372 --> 41:54.473
Hey, guys chill out.

41:55.441 --> 41:57.510
I meant, it's old English.

41:57.543 --> 41:58.844
And I still can't read it.

41:59.912 --> 42:01.580
Just give it here.

42:04.817 --> 42:06.485
This looks like some kinda

42:06.519 --> 42:09.688
Shakespearean writing
stuff or something.

42:09.722 --> 42:11.157
Looks like spells.

42:11.190 --> 42:13.292
You guys, it does not matter
what it says in that book.

42:13.325 --> 42:14.793
Right now,

42:14.827 --> 42:16.795
it's Sophia's condition we
should be worried about.

42:16.829 --> 42:18.430
We need to take her
to the hospital.

42:18.464 --> 42:19.899
No.

42:19.932 --> 42:22.301
It wouldn't be safe to
try and make it down now.

42:22.334 --> 42:23.802
Just give her the night to rest

42:23.836 --> 42:25.404
and we can head out first
thing tomorrow morning.

42:25.437 --> 42:26.739
I'm with you, bro,

42:26.772 --> 42:29.341
especially with all
this drama going on.

42:29.375 --> 42:30.609
You know, Brandon,

42:30.644 --> 42:32.311
you've always had a
way with your words.

42:32.344 --> 42:33.579
You're an asshole!

42:52.431 --> 42:53.199
There you are.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.334
I've been worried.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.837
Just couldn't sleep
thinking about her.

43:08.414 --> 43:09.248
Hey.

43:10.849 --> 43:11.984
Come back to bed, okay?

43:13.452 --> 43:14.286
Huh?

43:15.588 --> 43:19.792
Come on.

43:24.563 --> 43:25.898
Let me finish this.

43:33.707 --> 43:34.540
Okay.

43:40.112 --> 43:43.015
You think Sophia's
losing her mind?

43:44.583 --> 43:46.385
Something is wrong with her.

43:49.255 --> 43:50.823
Hey.

43:50.856 --> 43:52.992
Don't keep me waiting
too long, all right?

43:53.025 --> 43:53.859
I won't.

44:16.081 --> 44:16.915
Brandon?

44:20.219 --> 44:21.053
Who's there?

44:24.556 --> 44:25.958
Is that you, Blondie?

44:29.295 --> 44:31.463
If you're trying to scare
me, it's not working!

44:42.141 --> 44:43.542
Where you going?

44:43.575 --> 44:44.910
Come back here, you bitch!

46:20.939 --> 46:23.375
Michele,
what're you doing in here?

46:24.376 --> 46:26.011
I heard footsteps.

46:27.647 --> 46:28.914
I didn't mean to startle you.

46:28.947 --> 46:30.516
I just came back
from my recorder.

46:30.549 --> 46:31.785
No, I'm glad that you did

46:31.818 --> 46:33.085
because I don't wanna
keep this in anymore.

46:33.118 --> 46:34.219
I wanna tell you everything.

46:34.253 --> 46:36.856
All right, come on, let's go.

46:39.057 --> 46:40.627
Just start from the
beginning and tell me

46:40.660 --> 46:43.195
everything you wanna
tell me, all right?

46:44.463 --> 46:46.465
Michele, Michele, calm
down, what's wrong?

46:46.498 --> 46:47.299
- What happened?
- She came back!

46:47.332 --> 46:48.701
She came back!

46:48.735 --> 46:50.402
- No, it's okay, calm down.
- Sophia came back!

46:50.436 --> 46:51.704
Detective,
what have you done now?

46:51.738 --> 46:53.539
Nothing, I came in
and she as in the closet

46:53.572 --> 46:55.207
and started screaming.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.309
- Let's get you back in bed.
- Michele.

46:59.311 --> 47:02.047
I need assistance
and page Dr. Flanagan!

47:02.080 --> 47:03.449
Detective, you need to go!

47:05.017 --> 47:05.885
Calm down.

47:05.919 --> 47:07.319
I'll be back, Michele.

47:07.352 --> 47:09.455
I'll be back.

47:23.569 --> 47:24.403
Jessica?

47:25.304 --> 47:26.205
Jessica?

47:26.238 --> 47:27.707
Brandon, what's going on?

47:27.740 --> 47:30.509
It's Jessica, she never
came back to bed last night.

47:30.542 --> 47:31.610
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

47:31.644 --> 47:33.111
No, look, I checked!

47:33.145 --> 47:34.613
Yo, guys,
what's up, man?

47:34.647 --> 47:35.915
Jessica's missing.

47:35.949 --> 47:37.349
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- What?

47:37.382 --> 47:38.718
Sophia's gone too.

47:38.751 --> 47:39.819
Ah!

47:39.853 --> 47:40.653
What the hell's going on?

47:40.687 --> 47:41.888
We're fucking cursed!

47:41.921 --> 47:42.822
All right, everybody,
guys, just calm down.

47:42.856 --> 47:44.089
Let's just think this through.

47:44.122 --> 47:45.758
All right, look, you
can stay if you want,

47:45.792 --> 47:47.259
I'm not coming back
here without Jessica!

47:47.292 --> 47:48.560
- Brandon!
- Dude!

47:48.594 --> 47:51.764
Guy, guys, let's just split up

47:51.798 --> 47:52.832
and look for her again, okay?

47:52.866 --> 47:53.999
Split up?

47:54.032 --> 47:54.868
Dude!

47:56.669 --> 47:57.503
Jessica!

47:59.839 --> 48:00.940
Jessica!

48:08.213 --> 48:09.047
Jessica!

48:11.283 --> 48:12.117
Sophia!

48:17.256 --> 48:18.090
Jessica!

48:26.966 --> 48:27.800
Jessica!

48:31.403 --> 48:32.237
Jessica!

48:33.105 --> 48:33.907
Where are you?

48:33.940 --> 48:35.407
Come out!

48:35.440 --> 48:36.275
Sophia!

48:38.210 --> 48:39.044
Jessica!

48:43.716 --> 48:44.550
Nowhere.

48:55.561 --> 49:00.499
Jess.

49:02.234 --> 49:03.368
Jessica!

49:03.402 --> 49:04.938
Sophia!

49:04.971 --> 49:06.806
Whoa, do you feel that?

49:06.839 --> 49:07.907
No.

49:07.941 --> 49:10.009
There's something here.

49:11.176 --> 49:12.879
Oh, hell no.

49:12.912 --> 49:14.379
Don't even go there.

49:14.413 --> 49:17.884
Right now we just need to
find Jessica and Sophia.

49:17.917 --> 49:18.751
Come on.

49:27.192 --> 49:28.828
Jessica?

49:44.944 --> 49:45.778
Sophia?

49:59.291 --> 50:00.793
You're not Sophia.

50:01.694 --> 50:02.662
Who are you?

50:04.196 --> 50:05.297
Abigail Barker.

50:07.066 --> 50:09.802
Don't come any
closer, all right?

50:11.603 --> 50:12.437
I mean it!

50:14.339 --> 50:16.308
What'd you do to Jessica?

50:16.341 --> 50:19.277
She made a good sacrifice.

50:42.234 --> 50:43.703
Did you hear that?

50:43.736 --> 50:44.737
Shit, Brandon!

50:45.938 --> 50:47.807
Sounds like it
came from over there.

50:51.576 --> 50:53.445
- Nate, cut him down.
- Brandon.

51:10.630 --> 51:11.931
Oh my God!

51:11.964 --> 51:13.866
We found him hanging.

51:13.900 --> 51:15.400
Who could have done this?

51:15.434 --> 51:17.335
Brandon was the
toughest guy we knew.

51:18.403 --> 51:19.706
I don't know, man!

51:19.739 --> 51:22.240
There's gotta be
more than one killer.

51:22.274 --> 51:24.543
You guys, what're we gonna do?

51:26.846 --> 51:28.147
We can't leave him here.

51:29.749 --> 51:31.651
Let's just take him
back to the house.

51:47.133 --> 51:48.600
This is so unreal.

51:51.170 --> 51:51.971
Any ideas?

51:53.940 --> 51:54.741
No.

51:55.975 --> 51:57.710
Let's just get the
hell out of here.

52:04.382 --> 52:08.154
I don't know about you but I
really wanna get out of here.

52:08.187 --> 52:10.957
I just can't believe
this is happening.

52:10.990 --> 52:13.492
Nobody goes anywhere
without somebody with them.

52:15.762 --> 52:17.163
I wanna get out of here now.

52:17.196 --> 52:18.563
I'm with Rachel on getting
the hell out of here!

52:18.597 --> 52:20.066
We will as soon as it's safe.

52:20.099 --> 52:22.501
We'd never make it
back before nightfall.

52:22.534 --> 52:24.103
Yeah, Travis is right.

52:24.137 --> 52:26.404
We really should
all stay together.

52:26.438 --> 52:28.107
There's strength in numbers.

52:42.922 --> 52:43.756
Guys?

52:45.323 --> 52:46.159
Guys?

52:47.292 --> 52:49.294
Hey, did one of you
leave the backdoor open?

52:50.196 --> 52:51.898
No, not me.

52:51.931 --> 52:53.298
I didn't do it.

52:53.331 --> 52:54.767
Yeah, I wasn't in the kitchen.

52:54.801 --> 52:55.600
Well who did?

53:03.743 --> 53:04.576
There.

53:06.545 --> 53:08.547
Let's go make sure the rest
of this house is secured.

53:08.580 --> 53:09.949
Yeah, that's a good idea.

53:43.415 --> 53:44.250
Windows closed.

53:46.219 --> 53:47.887
Travis, I'm so scared.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.754
Hey,

53:49.922 --> 53:51.924
I'm here for you, babe.

53:51.958 --> 53:53.626
I won't let anything
happen to you.

53:58.430 --> 54:00.733
Oh, hey!

54:00.766 --> 54:01.600
How y'all doin'?

54:02.601 --> 54:03.501
Bedroom is secure.

54:05.104 --> 54:06.672
What does that mean,
that the house is safe now?

54:06.706 --> 54:08.506
As much as we can make it.

54:36.102 --> 54:37.270
I wish there was
something we could do

54:37.303 --> 54:38.871
about Sophia and Jessica.

54:38.905 --> 54:40.472
We need to get help.

54:40.505 --> 54:43.441
Have a real search party
out here looking for them.

54:43.475 --> 54:44.744
I hope they're okay.

54:45.945 --> 54:47.980
We just need to
stay safe tonight.

54:50.049 --> 54:52.351
I wonder what's in this book.

54:52.385 --> 54:53.352
I just wanna know why the hell

54:53.386 --> 54:56.022
she dug it up in
the first place.

54:56.055 --> 54:58.891
There's like
spells and chants.

54:59.825 --> 55:01.559
I found one for protection.

55:01.593 --> 55:03.396
Yo, close that book,
it's creeping me out.

55:03.428 --> 55:04.830
Wait till I get back
so that we can actually--

55:04.864 --> 55:06.799
Where you going?

55:06.832 --> 55:08.167
To get warmer sweats.

55:09.669 --> 55:11.170
I'll keep you warm.

55:11.203 --> 55:12.604
Yeah.

55:12.638 --> 55:14.740
That's exactly what
I was afraid of.

55:14.774 --> 55:16.409
What, no, I'm being serious.

55:17.542 --> 55:19.211
The group said we have
to stick together.

55:19.245 --> 55:20.413
Yeah.

55:20.445 --> 55:22.348
I'm gonna go get those,
I'll be right back.

55:23.515 --> 55:25.251
Wait, you guys,
listen to this.

55:26.852 --> 55:29.055
"Thrice around the circle bound,

55:29.088 --> 55:31.523
"all evil sinks into the ground.

55:31.556 --> 55:34.093
"By light of day
and darkness night,

55:34.126 --> 55:36.494
"I am protected by thee might.

55:36.528 --> 55:38.931
"Goddess of the moon and stars,

55:38.965 --> 55:41.334
"I call to thee
which tis me right,

55:41.367 --> 55:43.601
"protect me from
all evil's might.

55:58.784 --> 56:01.220
"Protected me from
all evil's harm.

56:01.253 --> 56:03.422
"Protect me from
all evil's might.

56:03.456 --> 56:05.157
"Protect me from
all evil's harm."

56:07.426 --> 56:08.627
Hey!

56:08.661 --> 56:09.494
You all right?

56:10.495 --> 56:11.330
Yeah.

56:12.465 --> 56:14.532
Sounds like a
weird nursery rhyme.

56:14.566 --> 56:16.969
Why don't you put that
away and come here?

56:17.003 --> 56:19.739
I wouldn't be reading
those if I were you.

56:19.772 --> 56:21.240
You don't know what they are.

56:23.109 --> 56:23.943
Rachel?

56:29.648 --> 56:30.483
Rachel?

56:31.549 --> 56:34.020
Hey guys, come here.

56:44.330 --> 56:45.664
Michele, Michele.

56:45.698 --> 56:48.200
You're all right,
you're all right.

56:51.771 --> 56:53.806
Nate, watch my back.

56:53.839 --> 56:54.673
Gotcha.

56:59.879 --> 57:01.714
Shit!

57:01.747 --> 57:03.916
Where the hell did she go?

57:06.385 --> 57:07.552
I don't know.

57:07.585 --> 57:08.954
We have to leave now.

57:10.856 --> 57:11.690
Shit!

57:13.591 --> 57:15.428
I so fucking hate her.

57:21.734 --> 57:23.135
Get her out of here!

58:05.610 --> 58:06.979
- Ow!
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

58:07.012 --> 58:08.848
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

58:08.881 --> 58:11.250
Just put a little pressure
on it so you know you can walk.

58:11.283 --> 58:12.952
- All right, I got it.
- Ready?

58:12.985 --> 58:14.019
Yeah, let's go.

58:14.053 --> 58:15.121
Come on.

59:09.074 --> 59:10.309
- Nate! Nate!
- What? What?

59:10.342 --> 59:11.510
I can't run anymore.

59:11.544 --> 59:12.845
- I can't run anymore.
- What happened?

59:12.878 --> 59:14.346
My knee.

59:14.380 --> 59:16.982
Okay, let's just get off the
trail and find cover, okay?

59:17.016 --> 59:17.850
Okay.

59:26.458 --> 59:28.761
Nate, Nate, seriously,
I can't go on.

59:28.794 --> 59:30.596
Okay, then let's
just relax, okay?

59:31.764 --> 59:32.831
I don't know what
the hell that was

59:32.865 --> 59:34.800
but that was not Sophia.

59:34.833 --> 59:36.535
Look, she looks
like she's possessed.

59:36.569 --> 59:39.071
I don't know what's
wrong with her!

59:39.104 --> 59:40.674
Crap, look, we just
need to get out of here

59:40.706 --> 59:42.308
as quick as possible, period.

59:47.513 --> 59:48.948
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1:00:20.246 --> 1:00:22.615
Protected me from
all evil's might.

1:00:22.649 --> 1:00:24.250
Protect me from all evil's harm.

1:00:25.417 --> 1:00:27.553
Protect me from
all evil's might.

1:00:27.586 --> 1:00:30.256
Protect me from all evil's harm.

1:00:57.016 --> 1:00:58.517
She's gone.

1:00:58.550 --> 1:01:01.688
Yeah, I don't see her.

1:01:01.721 --> 1:01:02.554
Nate,

1:01:03.789 --> 1:01:05.157
my knee hurts so bad.

1:01:06.225 --> 1:01:07.426
You should just go.

1:01:07.459 --> 1:01:09.128
No, I'm not leaving you here.

1:01:10.529 --> 1:01:12.632
We stay here for the night
and leave at daylight.

1:01:14.033 --> 1:01:15.968
You're strong, I know you.

1:01:55.709 --> 1:01:56.842
Michele, we gotta move.

1:01:57.910 --> 1:01:59.478
I know.

1:01:59.511 --> 1:02:00.780
My knee's feeling just
a little bit better.

1:02:00.814 --> 1:02:02.281
It still hurts?

1:02:02.314 --> 1:02:03.148
Yeah.

1:02:08.854 --> 1:02:09.823
Try this.

1:02:09.855 --> 1:02:10.622
Okay.

1:02:10.657 --> 1:02:11.523
I think this will work.

1:02:11.557 --> 1:02:12.624
- It'll work?
- Yeah.

1:02:45.023 --> 1:02:45.859
Nate.

1:02:47.025 --> 1:02:48.661
What are we gonna
tell their moms?

1:02:50.229 --> 1:02:51.731
Travis' mom.

1:02:51.765 --> 1:02:54.667
All right, look, let's not
concentrate on that right now.

1:02:54.701 --> 1:02:56.969
Let's just concentrate
on getting out of here.

1:02:59.405 --> 1:03:00.172
Sorry.

1:03:00.205 --> 1:03:02.174
Hey, it's all right.

1:03:02.207 --> 1:03:03.041
Be strong.

1:03:04.677 --> 1:03:07.980
Take it one step
at a time, okay?

1:03:08.013 --> 1:03:09.114
There you go.

1:03:10.082 --> 1:03:12.050
We're almost there.

1:03:25.063 --> 1:03:27.132
- All right?
- Yeah.

1:03:28.934 --> 1:03:30.235
We made it.

1:03:30.269 --> 1:03:31.570
Please tell me
you have the keys.

1:03:31.603 --> 1:03:32.672
Yeah, I do.

1:03:37.176 --> 1:03:38.444
You stay here, okay?

1:04:10.743 --> 1:04:13.011
No, no, no.

1:04:17.851 --> 1:04:18.952
No, Nate, no.

1:04:20.085 --> 1:04:21.019
No, no, no.

1:04:22.922 --> 1:04:24.490
Sophia!

1:04:27.025 --> 1:04:28.761
Sophia, why?

1:04:28.795 --> 1:04:29.995
I'm Abigail.

1:04:30.028 --> 1:04:31.831
Sophia, it's me, Michele!

1:04:31.865 --> 1:04:33.432
Blood must be shed.

1:04:35.067 --> 1:04:36.401
But they're our
friends, Sophia.

1:04:36.435 --> 1:04:39.538
They were useless to me.

1:04:41.273 --> 1:04:43.308
You stay away from me.

1:04:43.342 --> 1:04:45.611
You stay away!

1:04:45.645 --> 1:04:46.646
That doesn't work.

1:04:49.649 --> 1:04:50.482
Ow!

1:04:51.350 --> 1:04:53.151
Sophia, listen to me!

1:04:53.185 --> 1:04:54.219
Let me help you!

1:04:57.422 --> 1:04:59.157
Michele, oh my God, help me.

1:04:59.191 --> 1:05:00.793
Please help me.

1:05:00.827 --> 1:05:02.060
Sophia, what can I do?

1:05:03.930 --> 1:05:06.131
Give me my book!

1:05:06.164 --> 1:05:08.534
And if I don't?

1:05:08.567 --> 1:05:11.905
You don't know
what you're doing.

1:05:11.938 --> 1:05:13.940
You think you can negotiate?

1:05:13.973 --> 1:05:17.242
One sure thing,
the book is mine!

1:05:17.276 --> 1:05:18.711
Abigail,

1:05:18.745 --> 1:05:21.146
let Sophia go!

1:05:21.179 --> 1:05:22.782
Too late now!

1:05:22.815 --> 1:05:23.850
She is gone!

1:05:25.117 --> 1:05:26.585
You crazy bitch!

1:05:30.890 --> 1:05:31.891
No!

1:05:37.931 --> 1:05:38.932
Hey!

1:05:38.965 --> 1:05:39.966
Leave her alone!

1:05:43.569 --> 1:05:44.403
Hey!

1:05:50.710 --> 1:05:51.543
Hey, you!

1:05:57.249 --> 1:06:00.787
And I don't remember
anything after that.

1:06:02.855 --> 1:06:03.690
Well,

1:06:05.457 --> 1:06:07.159
Michele, I think
that clears it up.

1:06:07.192 --> 1:06:10.162
The hunter corroborated
your story, however,

1:06:10.195 --> 1:06:13.198
we have yet to confirm the
perpetrator's identity.

1:06:13.231 --> 1:06:15.567
Detective, it's Sophia!

1:06:15.601 --> 1:06:17.804
Abigail possessed her,
why can't you believe me?

1:06:17.837 --> 1:06:19.072
Calm down, calm down.

1:06:19.104 --> 1:06:20.372
You need to get some
rest, all right?

1:06:20.405 --> 1:06:22.307
I'll have a transcript
made of this recording

1:06:22.341 --> 1:06:24.010
and we'll go from
there, all right?

1:06:24.043 --> 1:06:24.944
I promise.

1:06:26.411 --> 1:06:28.047
Did you guys find Jessica?

1:06:31.985 --> 1:06:32.819
We did.

1:06:36.990 --> 1:06:37.824
Is she?

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:40.425
I'm afraid so.

1:06:40.459 --> 1:06:41.293
Michele?

1:06:42.527 --> 1:06:43.663
Time for your meds.

1:06:46.131 --> 1:06:48.367
Good afternoon,
Detective Henderson.

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:49.234
Judy.

1:06:51.370 --> 1:06:52.371
Are you done?

1:06:54.941 --> 1:06:56.408
Actually, we're done.

1:06:56.441 --> 1:06:58.176
Take care, Michele, I'll be
in touch soon, all right?

1:06:58.210 --> 1:06:59.045
We'll talk.

1:07:02.982 --> 1:07:05.084
Detective, you're
not gonna find Sophia.

1:07:06.886 --> 1:07:08.353
Not unless she wants you to.

1:07:12.058 --> 1:07:12.992
I'll be in touch.

1:07:37.817 --> 1:07:39.819
Detective Henderson.

1:07:39.852 --> 1:07:42.487
Howard, how are you?

1:07:42.521 --> 1:07:44.757
Fascinating person,
this Abigail Barker.

1:07:46.291 --> 1:07:47.994
She was a real person then?

1:07:48.027 --> 1:07:49.028
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1:07:49.062 --> 1:07:52.031
She was born in 1670.

1:07:52.999 --> 1:07:54.399
What else can you tell me?

1:07:57.804 --> 1:07:58.871
Well,

1:07:58.905 --> 1:08:01.440
this Abigail Barker was

1:08:01.473 --> 1:08:04.911
put on trial in 1692

1:08:04.944 --> 1:08:08.114
and she was found
guilty of practicing

1:08:08.147 --> 1:08:10.883
acts of witchcraft by
the local magistrate.

1:08:10.917 --> 1:08:13.019
She was then tortured,

1:08:13.052 --> 1:08:16.089
which was standard
practice at the time,

1:08:16.122 --> 1:08:18.691
and then eventually executed.

1:08:18.725 --> 1:08:19.524
Really?

1:08:21.728 --> 1:08:23.629
Okay, wait a minute.

1:08:23.663 --> 1:08:25.732
How easy would it
be for my witness

1:08:25.765 --> 1:08:27.532
to have access to
that information?

1:08:29.836 --> 1:08:31.369
Well, anyone can research it,

1:08:31.403 --> 1:08:35.373
but I suppose "why"
would be my question

1:08:35.407 --> 1:08:36.241
and then,

1:08:37.609 --> 1:08:39.846
how would they even find
this book in the first place?

1:08:39.879 --> 1:08:41.613
Which, by the way,

1:08:41.647 --> 1:08:46.451
happens to be a compellation
of spells and incantations.

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:49.387
To tell you the truth, I as
hoping you were gonna tell me

1:08:49.421 --> 1:08:51.791
that Abigail Barker was
just a bunch of folklore

1:08:51.824 --> 1:08:53.592
and that book a
bunch of nonsense.

1:08:54.994 --> 1:08:58.631
Now I can get back to work
and get that book carbonated.

1:08:58.664 --> 1:09:00.032
What else do you got for me?

1:09:01.234 --> 1:09:02.702
Well, I don't know
if it's relevant at all

1:09:02.735 --> 1:09:04.904
but I also found
some documentation

1:09:04.937 --> 1:09:08.306
of accusations against
witches using amulets

1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:11.343
to transform
themselves into animals

1:09:11.376 --> 1:09:14.080
and even powerful
creatures, supposedly.

1:09:14.113 --> 1:09:15.547
You've gotta be kidding me.

1:09:15.580 --> 1:09:17.616
No, it was actually
documented multiple times

1:09:17.650 --> 1:09:18.818
during the witch trials.

1:09:20.086 --> 1:09:21.586
Well, that's about
all I have for now

1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:25.158
but keep me posted on
what happens, okay?

1:09:25.191 --> 1:09:26.893
Most
definitely, thank you.

1:09:26.926 --> 1:09:27.927
All right.

1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:28.795
Goodbye.

1:10:10.837 --> 1:10:12.872
Howard.

1:10:12.905 --> 1:10:13.973
Who is that?

1:10:15.473 --> 1:10:17.910
You know who this is.

1:10:17.944 --> 1:10:19.846
No, I don't know you.

1:10:20.780 --> 1:10:22.982
Oh, but you do.

1:10:23.015 --> 1:10:24.083
It's Abigail.

1:10:26.252 --> 1:10:27.086
No.

1:10:28.221 --> 1:10:29.889
That's not possible.

1:10:30.890 --> 1:10:32.892
Aren't you a believer?

1:10:35.328 --> 1:10:36.595
Take a seat, Professor.

1:10:46.571 --> 1:10:47.572
I said, sit down!

1:10:50.877 --> 1:10:52.645
I don't understand.

1:10:52.678 --> 1:10:55.380
You're no different
than they were.

1:10:56.849 --> 1:10:59.185
It seems the professor has
been telling tall tales

1:10:59.218 --> 1:11:00.585
to Detective Henderson.

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:05.457
People love tall tales,
wouldn't you say?

1:11:06.359 --> 1:11:07.360
I suppose.

1:11:08.526 --> 1:11:11.898
When I was younger
I used art and spells

1:11:11.931 --> 1:11:13.299
to connect with nature.

1:11:14.734 --> 1:11:16.269
I only meant good back then.

1:11:17.937 --> 1:11:22.842
The folks people lied
and labeled me a witch!

1:11:22.875 --> 1:11:25.144
They did unspeakable
things to me!

1:11:26.544 --> 1:11:28.214
And I now you know the rest!

1:11:29.581 --> 1:11:32.018
But they couldn't destroy me.

1:11:33.953 --> 1:11:36.055
Because I choose darkness.

1:11:38.157 --> 1:11:38.991
My ally.

1:11:40.226 --> 1:11:42.228
We have just been
waiting to find someone

1:11:42.261 --> 1:11:44.130
to give me my vessel.

1:11:44.163 --> 1:11:45.364
The book of spells.

1:11:45.398 --> 1:11:48.334
Ah, you're a smart
man, Professor.

1:11:49.702 --> 1:11:51.503
So I'm sure you understand

1:11:54.073 --> 1:11:55.573
that until I find my book,

1:11:57.609 --> 1:12:00.246
I only need a little blood
sacrifice here and there.

1:12:11.757 --> 1:12:14.627
Professor, let's see what
dead flesh feels like.

1:12:34.780 --> 1:12:35.613
Sleepy time.

1:12:53.598 --> 1:12:58.570
So Dr. Flanagan said that I
could go home in a day or two.

1:12:59.805 --> 1:13:01.640
Don't you think
it's a bit too soon?

1:13:02.808 --> 1:13:04.377
Why do you say that, Grandma?

1:13:05.277 --> 1:13:08.280
You're still having episodes.

1:13:09.614 --> 1:13:11.250
The neighbors
are talking, huh?

1:13:11.283 --> 1:13:13.618
You know I don't
care about that.

1:13:13.652 --> 1:13:16.122
So then why do you have a
problem with me coming home?

1:13:16.155 --> 1:13:17.056
I don't.

1:13:19.458 --> 1:13:21.260
How's Travis' mom doing?

1:13:23.262 --> 1:13:24.964
Well,

1:13:24.997 --> 1:13:26.966
as well as can be
expected, you know.

1:13:29.668 --> 1:13:30.936
They all blame me, huh?

1:13:32.438 --> 1:13:35.341
Honey, until this thing
gets all sorted out,

1:13:35.374 --> 1:13:36.608
people are gonna talk,

1:13:36.642 --> 1:13:38.310
they're gonna come to
their own conclusions.

1:13:38.344 --> 1:13:40.813
Yeah, well I'm a victim
in this too, Grandma!

1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:43.548
I know you are, sweetheart.

1:13:46.218 --> 1:13:47.053
You know,

1:13:48.487 --> 1:13:53.192
Sophia's parents have put up
a reward for her safe return.

1:13:53.225 --> 1:13:55.261
She's not coming home!

1:13:56.395 --> 1:13:57.595
She's dead!

1:13:57.630 --> 1:13:58.864
I mean, how many times

1:13:58.898 --> 1:14:00.766
do I have to keep
telling people this?

1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:03.302
Sophia is not Sophia anymore!

1:14:04.804 --> 1:14:09.574
Sophia killed Travis, she killed
all of my friends, Grandma!

1:14:09.607 --> 1:14:10.709
Oh, honey.

1:14:11.844 --> 1:14:12.745
That's why I don't
want you to be

1:14:12.778 --> 1:14:14.046
in such a hurry to come home.

1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:15.281
Grandma, I don't wanna stay

1:14:15.314 --> 1:14:18.017
in this fucking
hospital anymore!

1:14:18.050 --> 1:14:20.019
It's like a fucking
prison in here!

1:14:20.052 --> 1:14:22.354
I miss all of my
friends' funerals.

1:15:08.434 --> 1:15:10.236
Lieutenant.

1:15:10.269 --> 1:15:11.303
What's up?

1:15:39.398 --> 1:15:40.432
Hey, Nikki.

1:15:40.466 --> 1:15:41.901
Detective.

1:15:41.934 --> 1:15:44.537
Looks like Miles had a chance
to call 911 before he died,

1:15:44.570 --> 1:15:48.040
so approximate time
of death, 9:10 PM.

1:15:48.073 --> 1:15:49.775
He's got a single knife
wound to the chest,

1:15:49.808 --> 1:15:51.744
was also stabbed in the hands.

1:15:51.777 --> 1:15:54.313
There's some claw marks
in the back of his neck.

1:15:54.346 --> 1:15:55.514
God.

1:15:55.548 --> 1:15:57.016
How did they get in?

1:15:57.049 --> 1:15:58.217
No sign of a break-in.

1:15:58.250 --> 1:16:00.186
We had to pick the front
lock to gain access.

1:16:00.219 --> 1:16:01.287
Locked from the inside.

1:16:05.558 --> 1:16:06.759
What's this?

1:16:06.792 --> 1:16:08.294
He wrote a name
with his blood.

1:16:08.327 --> 1:16:09.929
Don't touch anything.

1:16:09.962 --> 1:16:11.363
Forensics is on the way.

1:16:13.265 --> 1:16:15.568
Okay, that's odd because Miles

1:16:15.601 --> 1:16:18.470
was doing some research for
me on an Abigail Barker.

1:16:18.504 --> 1:16:20.239
So we have a suspect?

1:16:20.272 --> 1:16:22.541
Not exactly, the Abigail
Barker we're talking about

1:16:22.575 --> 1:16:24.310
died in 1692.

1:16:26.745 --> 1:16:28.814
I guess that was too easy.

1:16:28.847 --> 1:16:30.749
Hey, what about that 911 call?

1:16:30.783 --> 1:16:31.817
He only asked
for an ambulance.

1:16:31.850 --> 1:16:33.786
The line went solid after that.

1:16:33.819 --> 1:16:35.721
Okay, I'm gonna wanna
get a copy of that call.

1:16:35.754 --> 1:16:38.591
I'll get you a copy
and put it in the folder.

1:16:38.624 --> 1:16:40.526
Hey, how's that
Chadwick case coming?

1:16:42.394 --> 1:16:45.064
Slowly, we're dealing
with a very fragile victim.

1:16:45.097 --> 1:16:45.998
Victim?

1:16:46.031 --> 1:16:47.667
Thought she was a suspect.

1:16:47.701 --> 1:16:49.068
Another girl went missing

1:16:50.236 --> 1:16:51.971
and right now she's
the only survivor.

1:17:10.522 --> 1:17:11.725
Well,

1:17:11.757 --> 1:17:13.959
physically, you're
in excellent shape.

1:17:15.327 --> 1:17:16.795
Any pain?

1:17:16.829 --> 1:17:17.631
Nope.

1:17:18.698 --> 1:17:20.032
How about the nightmares?

1:17:21.233 --> 1:17:24.203
Oh yeah, those haven't
come around in awhile.

1:17:25.639 --> 1:17:26.572
Ready to go home?

1:17:27.707 --> 1:17:29.174
Sure.

1:17:29.208 --> 1:17:31.243
Well I'm gonna change
your medication a little bit

1:17:31.277 --> 1:17:34.446
and if you have another
day without any incidents,

1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:35.848
you can go home.

1:17:35.881 --> 1:17:36.982
Sounds good to me.

1:17:38.450 --> 1:17:41.253
Lower her dosage
to 25 milligrams

1:17:41.287 --> 1:17:42.621
and let's keep an eye on her.

1:17:42.656 --> 1:17:45.090
What about her
nighttime pills?

1:17:45.124 --> 1:17:46.358
Just give me a
call in the afternoon

1:17:46.392 --> 1:17:48.127
and we'll make a decision then.

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:50.730
Dr. Flanagan, am I gonna
have to take these pills

1:17:50.764 --> 1:17:52.298
once I go home?

1:17:52.331 --> 1:17:55.267
Well, with this medication,
you can't quit cold turkey.

1:17:55.301 --> 1:17:58.470
We have to decreased
your dosage gradually.

1:17:58.504 --> 1:18:01.106
I want you to contact
your family physician

1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:02.474
in the next two days.

1:18:03.743 --> 1:18:05.544
We'll send you home
with some instructions

1:18:05.577 --> 1:18:07.846
and my notes to your doctor.

1:18:09.315 --> 1:18:10.449
Okay, because I'm ready to go.

1:18:10.482 --> 1:18:11.685
Yeah, I bet you are.

1:18:26.932 --> 1:18:29.669
What do you got for me?

1:18:29.703 --> 1:18:30.536
I got nothing.

1:18:32.004 --> 1:18:33.539
I've dusted head to
toe several times.

1:18:33.572 --> 1:18:35.742
I can't even find
a partial print.

1:18:35.775 --> 1:18:37.076
What about these
claw marks, here?

1:18:37.109 --> 1:18:40.546
Any idea where they
would have come from?

1:18:40.579 --> 1:18:42.147
They appear to

1:18:43.349 --> 1:18:45.317
have been made by talons.

1:18:45.351 --> 1:18:47.152
However, that's not
what killed him.

1:18:47.186 --> 1:18:49.555
He died from a single
knife wound to the chest.

1:18:50.757 --> 1:18:52.124
What about under
the fingernails?

1:18:52.157 --> 1:18:53.660
Clean.

1:18:53.693 --> 1:18:56.730
Whatever it was, the poor
guy didn't have a chance.

1:19:00.767 --> 1:19:01.900
Hey there.

1:19:01.934 --> 1:19:04.804
Hi, Beth, I'm
ready to go home now.

1:19:04.838 --> 1:19:06.305
I bet.

1:19:06.338 --> 1:19:09.041
I should hopefully have your
paperwork done within an hour.

1:19:09.975 --> 1:19:10.777
You done with this?

1:19:10.810 --> 1:19:12.411
Oh yeah, thank you.

1:19:12.444 --> 1:19:14.346
Let me know if
there's anything else

1:19:14.380 --> 1:19:15.648
you need in the meantime.

1:19:15.682 --> 1:19:20.687
I will.

1:19:45.244 --> 1:19:46.912
What are you doing?

1:19:46.945 --> 1:19:47.781
Stop!

1:19:48.882 --> 1:19:50.416
Stop!

1:19:50.449 --> 1:19:51.751
It'll feel good.

1:19:51.785 --> 1:19:53.753
Somebody help me!

1:19:53.787 --> 1:19:54.620
Help!

1:19:56.455 --> 1:19:57.289
Help me!

1:19:59.158 --> 1:20:01.193
Don't bother screaming,
no one can hear you talking.

1:20:09.001 --> 1:20:11.003
It's so good to be home.

1:20:12.304 --> 1:20:13.305
Come here.

1:20:15.507 --> 1:20:18.343
Everything's gonna be
fine now that you're back.

1:20:18.377 --> 1:20:19.545
Thank you, Grandma.

1:20:19.578 --> 1:20:20.979
You're always so optimistic.

1:20:25.451 --> 1:20:27.787
Why don't we order some pizza?

1:20:27.821 --> 1:20:28.620
Sounds great.

1:20:29.488 --> 1:20:30.322
Okay.

1:21:17.704 --> 1:21:19.706
Excuse me, can I help you?

1:21:19.739 --> 1:21:20.707
Where is she?

1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:21.641
Excuse me?

1:21:22.608 --> 1:21:23.710
That whore!

1:21:24.878 --> 1:21:26.946
You need to leave right now.

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:28.347
I don't think you heard me.

1:21:28.380 --> 1:21:31.550
I said, where is that
bitch of a whore?

1:21:31.583 --> 1:21:32.551
You need to leave!

1:21:36.388 --> 1:21:37.991
Where?

1:21:40.092 --> 1:21:41.761
Where is she?

1:21:41.794 --> 1:21:44.029
She's gone home.

1:21:44.062 --> 1:21:44.998
Goodbye.

1:21:48.968 --> 1:21:50.135
What's going on here?

1:21:51.671 --> 1:21:52.939
Too late, Doctor.

1:21:56.275 --> 1:21:57.476
What the hell are you?

1:22:07.286 --> 1:22:08.688
Shoulda heeded my warning.

1:22:13.927 --> 1:22:15.561
Hey, there's one more slice.

1:22:15.594 --> 1:22:17.062
Oh no, I'm too full.

1:22:17.095 --> 1:22:18.898
Oh, okay, you want more?

1:22:18.932 --> 1:22:19.732
Sure.

1:22:19.766 --> 1:22:21.366
Okay.

1:22:22.234 --> 1:22:23.068
I'll get it.

1:22:33.012 --> 1:22:33.913
Detective.

1:22:33.947 --> 1:22:35.247
Mrs. Chadwick.

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:36.683
What can I do for you?

1:22:36.716 --> 1:22:38.150
Is Michele home?

1:22:38.183 --> 1:22:39.018
Yes.

1:22:40.185 --> 1:22:41.620
What's going on?

1:22:41.654 --> 1:22:43.622
May I come in, I need
to speak with you both.

1:22:43.656 --> 1:22:45.090
Sure.

1:22:45.123 --> 1:22:45.959
Wait here.

1:22:51.396 --> 1:22:53.231
Honey, it's the detective.

1:22:55.367 --> 1:22:57.135
Michele, I'm gonna
get right to the point.

1:22:57.169 --> 1:22:59.038
There's been a tragedy
at he hospital.

1:23:00.006 --> 1:23:01.206
What happened?

1:23:01.239 --> 1:23:03.776
This afternoon, Dr.
Flanagan, his main nurse

1:23:03.810 --> 1:23:06.045
and a security
guard were killed.

1:23:06.079 --> 1:23:06.879
Oh my God.

1:23:06.913 --> 1:23:08.347
It's Abigail!

1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:10.850
Strangely enough, several
witnesses have confirmed

1:23:10.883 --> 1:23:12.150
that the perpetrator's identity

1:23:12.184 --> 1:23:13.753
does fit the
description of Sophia,

1:23:13.786 --> 1:23:15.220
with the exception of her eyes.

1:23:15.253 --> 1:23:18.290
No, it's Abigail, I
told you, she's coming!

1:23:18.323 --> 1:23:21.193
I've got two officers
guarding your house

1:23:21.226 --> 1:23:23.096
and in the morning they will
take you down to the station

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:24.329
to sign your statement.

1:23:24.363 --> 1:23:26.431
It was Abigail, I
told you she's coming.

1:23:26.465 --> 1:23:28.333
So you do think
we're in danger.

1:23:28.367 --> 1:23:29.802
I'm not taking any chances.

1:23:29.836 --> 1:23:32.504
I've got two officers guarding
the perimeter of your home

1:23:32.537 --> 1:23:34.373
and I'm not leaving until
I know it's secured.

1:23:55.594 --> 1:23:57.162
Mmmm.

1:23:57.195 --> 1:23:58.698
Want me to fix you
something before you leave?

1:23:58.731 --> 1:24:00.465
Oh no, I'm just
gonna get some coffee.

1:24:00.499 --> 1:24:01.266
Okay.

1:24:11.410 --> 1:24:12.812
Oh, Grandma, they're here.

1:24:14.681 --> 1:24:15.948
So I'll see you later.

1:24:15.982 --> 1:24:16.883
Good luck, baby.

1:24:18.818 --> 1:24:20.419
Call me if you're gonna be late.

1:24:21.586 --> 1:24:22.789
Okay.

1:24:25.223 --> 1:24:26.258
Your ride is here.

1:24:32.197 --> 1:24:33.866
Are you all right, miss?

1:24:37.870 --> 1:24:38.705
Yeah.

1:24:40.238 --> 1:24:42.340
Just a little chest pain.

1:24:42.374 --> 1:24:43.843
Okay, ready to go?

1:24:43.876 --> 1:24:45.510
Yeah, let's do this.

1:24:57.355 --> 1:25:02.260
We've got another room
down here we can check out.

1:25:02.294 --> 1:25:03.696
Yeah, let's use this room.

1:25:05.164 --> 1:25:06.632
There you are, I've been
looking all over for you.

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:07.599
What's up?

1:25:07.633 --> 1:25:09.135
Stevenson found something.

1:25:10.103 --> 1:25:11.503
What does he have?

1:25:11.536 --> 1:25:14.439
Not sure but it sounded
extremely important.

1:25:14.473 --> 1:25:16.408
I was just about to have
Michele repeat her statement.

1:25:16.441 --> 1:25:18.610
I'll get it started for you.

1:25:18.644 --> 1:25:19.578
You sure?

1:25:19.611 --> 1:25:20.980
Yeah, I've got some time.

1:25:21.013 --> 1:25:22.949
Michele, this is
Lieutenant Paxton,

1:25:22.982 --> 1:25:24.449
he's going to review
your statement with you.

1:25:24.483 --> 1:25:27.619
When you read it, make sure
you look over everything, okay?

1:25:27.653 --> 1:25:28.553
Okay.

1:25:28.587 --> 1:25:29.856
All right, I'll be right back.

1:25:29.889 --> 1:25:31.389
Hey, young lady, shall we?

1:25:35.494 --> 1:25:36.328
Have a seat.

1:25:42.034 --> 1:25:42.869
Here you go.

1:25:45.437 --> 1:25:47.039
Whoa.

1:25:47.073 --> 1:25:49.208
Yeah, Henderson can
be pretty thorough.

1:25:50.408 --> 1:25:52.511
Looks like you got a
lot of reading to do.

1:25:53.980 --> 1:25:55.280
You need something to drink?

1:25:55.313 --> 1:25:56.783
No, thank you.

1:25:56.816 --> 1:25:58.751
Okay, go ahead and make
any corrections you need

1:25:58.785 --> 1:26:01.220
and I will be right back.

1:26:11.197 --> 1:26:12.999
I have something
you'll wanna see.

1:26:14.734 --> 1:26:15.534
Take a look.

1:26:15.567 --> 1:26:16.669
What is it?

1:26:16.702 --> 1:26:18.104
It's the tip of the blade.

1:26:19.105 --> 1:26:20.239
Is it gold?

1:26:21.373 --> 1:26:22.574
No.

1:26:22.607 --> 1:26:25.477
It's either a bronze
or a copper blend.

1:26:25.510 --> 1:26:26.378
Really?

1:26:27.546 --> 1:26:29.548
I'll send it to a
metallist to confirm.

1:26:29.581 --> 1:26:30.817
Any idea?

1:26:30.850 --> 1:26:32.251
It's very old.

1:26:32.285 --> 1:26:34.419
I don't have the equipment
to date it properly.

1:26:53.072 --> 1:26:54.640
How are you doing?

1:26:54.674 --> 1:26:56.876
I just finished.

1:26:56.909 --> 1:26:58.510
Anything you'd like to change?

1:26:59.679 --> 1:27:01.113
No, everything
seems about right.

1:27:02.281 --> 1:27:04.583
So this is not
an interrogation.

1:27:04.616 --> 1:27:06.686
Just a couple things
I'd like to confirm.

1:27:11.423 --> 1:27:14.260
Is this the knife you said
Brandon had in his possession?

1:27:15.393 --> 1:27:16.229
Yes.

1:27:20.432 --> 1:27:22.134
What about this book?

1:27:25.872 --> 1:27:27.306
Yeah, that's the book.

1:27:31.010 --> 1:27:32.178
Okay.

1:27:32.211 --> 1:27:34.714
I just wanted to make
sure everything--

1:27:34.747 --> 1:27:36.349
If you ask me...

1:27:41.854 --> 1:27:43.656
I have no respect for authority.

1:27:43.689 --> 1:27:45.358
Sophia, come on, it's me!

1:27:45.390 --> 1:27:47.960
I'm Michele, I'm your friend!

1:27:49.561 --> 1:27:51.130
Oh please, come on.

1:27:52.064 --> 1:27:52.899
Come on.

1:28:20.525 --> 1:28:22.228
Sophia is dead.

1:28:30.002 --> 1:28:31.938
I couldn't have killed you.

1:28:31.971 --> 1:28:33.538
You were protected.

1:28:34.506 --> 1:28:36.642
The book is mine.

1:28:51.824 --> 1:28:52.658
Hey!

1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.227
Stop!

1:29:12.845 --> 1:29:13.679
Oh my God!

1:29:16.148 --> 1:29:18.550
I need am ambulance now!

1:29:18.583 --> 1:29:19.418
Michele.

1:29:20.853 --> 1:29:22.021
Oh my God.

1:29:22.054 --> 1:29:22.888
Michele.

1:29:27.293 --> 1:29:28.928
Michele, you're all right.

1:29:28.961 --> 1:29:30.162
Sophia.

1:29:30.196 --> 1:29:30.997
What?

1:29:31.030 --> 1:29:32.231
Sophia.

1:29:32.264 --> 1:29:33.632
You should just
save your strength.

1:29:33.666 --> 1:29:36.135
I need help in here, now!

1:29:57.957 --> 1:30:00.359
Can I get a ride?

1:30:00.393 --> 1:30:01.394
Sure.

1:30:01.427 --> 1:30:02.762
What's your name?

1:30:02.795 --> 1:30:04.363
Abigail.

1:31:06.826 --> 1:31:09.161
