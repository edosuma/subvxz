01:14.718 --> 01:18.468
- They're killing my
friend in the next room.

01:20.041 --> 01:22.374
Ericson's not gonna make it.

01:27.602 --> 01:29.919
The only way I'm gonna make it out of here

01:29.919 --> 01:32.277
is if I send you for
help, you little bugger.

01:32.277 --> 01:33.110
All right?

01:37.987 --> 01:41.271
Through the hole in the wall,
out the back of the building.

01:41.271 --> 01:42.781
Get back to base.

01:42.781 --> 01:45.932
Colonel Balsam will know how
to track the GPS coordinates.

01:45.932 --> 01:46.932
Now go, now.

02:05.558 --> 02:06.904
- They're coming for you.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.601
- You think you're tough?

02:10.601 --> 02:13.077
You're not so tough now, are you, huh?

02:13.077 --> 02:13.910
Huh?

02:24.138 --> 02:24.971
- Fuck you!

02:24.971 --> 02:26.401
- Fuck me?

02:26.401 --> 02:27.484
No, fuck you!

02:45.442 --> 02:47.706
You wanna see your friend dies?

02:47.706 --> 02:48.539
Huh?

02:50.305 --> 02:52.222
You wanna see him dead?

02:53.232 --> 02:54.649
It's your choice.

04:12.075 --> 04:13.092
- Problem, Lieutenant?

04:13.092 --> 04:16.622
- Sir, either the desert stink
is startin' to get to you,

04:16.622 --> 04:20.803
or you got one of our bug
cams on your shoulder.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.220
- I'll be damned.

04:31.107 --> 04:31.940
- Lieutenant,

04:31.940 --> 04:32.773
- Sir?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.685
- has Sergeant Hauser's
unit checked in yet?

04:34.685 --> 04:37.078
- No sir.

04:37.078 --> 04:38.398
- Holy shit.

04:43.745 --> 04:44.578
Have contact with
housing unit immediately.

04:44.578 --> 04:46.495
- Yes sir.

04:53.052 --> 04:54.885
- I'm trapped,

04:55.870 --> 04:58.620
they're coming in from all sides.

05:02.891 --> 05:05.641
I need to find a way out of here.

05:14.378 --> 05:18.545
- Oh hey little masked
avenger, you live around here?

05:42.897 --> 05:43.730
- Coming.

05:47.955 --> 05:49.106
- Mrs. Hauser.

05:49.106 --> 05:51.699
- Robert.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.782
- My deepest regrets and condolences,

06:01.788 --> 06:02.871
I'm so sorry.

06:05.578 --> 06:07.538
Is that Bradley?

06:07.538 --> 06:09.525
Dammit he's grown.

06:09.525 --> 06:12.203
- Bradley I
thought you were swimming.

06:12.203 --> 06:14.286
Say hello to the colonel.

06:37.113 --> 06:38.696
- No way.

06:39.963 --> 06:41.213
No fucking way.

06:43.066 --> 06:43.899
- Bradley?

06:47.904 --> 06:48.737
Bradley?

06:50.451 --> 06:52.996
where did you find this box?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.708
These are your father's things.

06:54.708 --> 06:55.972
- It was just here.

06:55.972 --> 06:58.387
- I'm gonna
take this down to the garage.

06:58.387 --> 06:59.839
They're just taking up space here.

07:20.364 --> 07:21.614
- Hell is this?

07:27.271 --> 07:28.104
Is it on?

07:31.947 --> 07:34.114
You're on, let's try this.

07:38.878 --> 07:41.602
Okay, yeah that worked.

07:50.519 --> 07:51.769
Stay, stay put.

08:24.863 --> 08:26.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:29.664 --> 08:31.581
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:40.414 --> 08:41.246
Got it!

08:53.237 --> 08:57.404
Okay little bugger it's time
to show me what you got.

08:59.695 --> 09:03.862
Tracking my voice, tracking
my voice when I'm talking.

09:17.573 --> 09:21.740
Oh wow, so you can't track
me unless I actually speak.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.502
Talking, talking.

09:27.186 --> 09:29.770
Inside this velvet compartment
was a computer chip.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.484
So, I took the chip over
Maurice, he hooks me up

09:32.484 --> 09:34.597
with an adapter, plug it into the laptop

09:34.597 --> 09:36.902
and upload the software, and boom, it's

09:36.902 --> 09:39.253
a monitoring system, so we can see

09:39.253 --> 09:41.201
everything it sees, we can watch where it

09:41.201 --> 09:42.947
goes, we can even record ourselves on the

09:42.947 --> 09:44.864
laptops while we do it.

09:45.909 --> 09:47.882
- I am creaming my pants right now,

09:47.882 --> 09:50.254
do you realize all the cool
shit we could do with this?

09:50.254 --> 09:52.211
- Gear down turbo.

09:52.211 --> 09:54.014
Do you understand how much would suck if

09:54.014 --> 09:57.356
we lost this thing, or if we broke it,

09:57.356 --> 09:58.671
or if someone swatted it?

09:58.671 --> 10:03.199
- Like a fly, I get it Bradley,
but we can't not use this,

10:03.199 --> 10:05.292
life is too short we have to use this

10:05.292 --> 10:07.417
for something, for the power of good!

10:07.417 --> 10:10.196
We can spy Wall Street trading secrets or

10:10.196 --> 10:12.367
find out what color underwear
Suzy Rochester wears.

10:12.367 --> 10:14.910
I mean there's so many
things we could use this for.

10:15.743 --> 10:17.909
- Don't hit that button.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.111
You see, you cut off the signal feed.

10:20.111 --> 10:22.254
- I don't understand, if you
turn off the receiving unit

10:22.254 --> 10:23.631
the bug cam turns off?

10:23.631 --> 10:25.208
- No, no, it just goes offline,

10:25.208 --> 10:26.853
you see the red light there that comes

10:26.853 --> 10:28.766
on when the signal's been cut off, so

10:28.766 --> 10:30.644
at that point it's just floating free.

10:34.081 --> 10:38.164
- It got it, I told you
a dog has a unique voice.

10:41.186 --> 10:42.526
Wait, wait, wait.

10:42.526 --> 10:44.674
Plan B, two girls jogging just entered the

10:44.674 --> 10:48.296
park, what's it gonna be two guys making

10:48.296 --> 10:50.566
a love connection over there,
or two girls in spandex?

10:50.566 --> 10:52.427
- It's not a toy Peter, you
said for the power of good.

10:52.427 --> 10:54.664
- Yeah, the continuation of
the species, that is good.

10:54.664 --> 10:56.329
- So now you're
talking about making babies now?

10:56.329 --> 10:58.525
- Hurry up they're moving fast.

11:04.528 --> 11:05.778
Oh, major fail!

11:06.624 --> 11:08.291
- Hey, are you okay?

11:10.066 --> 11:11.422
- I think you
might have a concussion.

11:11.422 --> 11:13.255
- I'm sharp.

11:15.103 --> 11:16.699
- Sharp?

11:16.699 --> 11:17.775
- Well, let's go.

11:17.775 --> 11:18.608
- Oh wait.

11:22.175 --> 11:24.309
- Wait, follow my finger.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.729
- Vocal imprint, vocal imprint.

11:26.729 --> 11:30.882
- I'm sorry
could you repeat that?

11:30.882 --> 11:31.965
- What?

11:31.965 --> 11:34.932
I think he might have a concussion.

11:34.932 --> 11:36.932
I said follow my finger.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.092
- You're really stiff today Bradley.

11:40.092 --> 11:41.700
- Yeah, he's either got a concussion,

11:41.700 --> 11:43.867
or he's easily distracted.

11:44.950 --> 11:45.783
Gwen,

11:48.036 --> 11:48.869
let's go.

11:50.071 --> 11:52.188
- Get over here, it's my turn.

11:52.188 --> 11:53.021
Where you going?

11:53.021 --> 11:54.938
- Gwen, wait!

11:58.451 --> 12:00.069
- Shit.

12:00.069 --> 12:01.960
- You've got a bug on your shoulder.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.365
I just, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:03.365 --> 12:06.977
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
stay still, stay still.

12:06.977 --> 12:07.850
It's just gonna land.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.182
- I'm gonna help you Bradley.

12:10.182 --> 12:11.977
- Don't move please.

12:11.977 --> 12:13.884
It won't bite you I promise.

12:13.884 --> 12:14.717
Shoulder's a safe place.

12:14.717 --> 12:16.024
- Gwen let's go.

12:16.024 --> 12:18.524
- Just stay still, stay still.

12:22.249 --> 12:24.878
See, it'll just sit there.

12:24.878 --> 12:28.951
- Are you, you have
bug spray or something?

12:28.951 --> 12:30.327
- Wait, what?

12:30.327 --> 12:32.398
- Sorry girls, sorry
girls, top secret stuff,

12:32.398 --> 12:35.102
we could tell you but
we'd have to kill you.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.436
- This is my friend Peter.

12:36.436 --> 12:38.350
- Hey, yeah, we were
just here testing out this.

12:38.350 --> 12:41.192
- But we
actually have to go, so.

12:41.192 --> 12:42.025
- Gwen.

12:42.025 --> 12:43.315
- Gwen, of course,

12:43.315 --> 12:44.294
and you are?

12:44.294 --> 12:45.902
- Out of here.

12:45.902 --> 12:47.985
- Hey wait, wait.

12:50.076 --> 12:52.743
- It's good meeting you.

12:52.743 --> 12:54.243
do you do We Chat?

12:55.944 --> 12:57.180
- My dad doesn't like when I do it

12:57.180 --> 12:59.954
but I'll tell you anyways.

12:59.954 --> 13:03.134
It's Gwen Delicious, pretty stupid I know.

13:03.134 --> 13:05.019
Stef made me do it.

13:05.019 --> 13:08.130
- Gwen Delicious, I got it.

13:08.130 --> 13:08.963
- Bye.

13:18.263 --> 13:19.346
- Thanks bug.

sure, what we need, somebody's
got to make sure, 'cause you

14:13.830 --> 14:17.163
damn sure didn't do a good job yourself!

14:18.323 --> 14:19.321
You know we don't want to see you

14:19.321 --> 14:22.635
go out and get trapped in a bear trap.

14:22.635 --> 14:25.149
Where the jaws of the
bear are gonna come down.

14:25.149 --> 14:29.235
Looking scared at me, stop being scared!

14:35.644 --> 14:37.405
- What are you doing?

14:37.405 --> 14:38.738
That's annoying.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.957
- It's like short hand for morse code.

14:50.986 --> 14:53.486
- Did your dad teach you that?

14:54.413 --> 14:55.913
You must miss him.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.447
- How do you say,

15:02.037 --> 15:03.942
I'm here for you?

15:12.700 --> 15:15.675
- That means your nose is cute.

15:15.675 --> 15:17.842
- Teach me how to do that.

15:19.301 --> 15:20.634
- Maybe tonight.

15:31.761 --> 15:34.066
- Is it just me or do we both feel like

15:34.066 --> 15:36.483
we're being stalked by flies.

15:38.194 --> 15:39.027
- What?

15:41.012 --> 15:43.012
Oh, you know what it is?

15:45.340 --> 15:48.673
I think I left a window open last night.

15:52.807 --> 15:53.640
Yeah,

15:56.990 --> 16:01.157
it's alright, flies only live
for like 24 hours anyway.

16:06.988 --> 16:08.924
What are you doing?

16:08.924 --> 16:11.504
- Giving it an early retirement.

16:11.504 --> 16:15.114
- Gwen stop, Gwen stop please.

16:15.114 --> 16:18.174
Gwen, Gwen, seriously Gwen, please stop!

16:18.174 --> 16:21.168
You don't know what you're
doing, please stop that.

16:21.168 --> 16:22.238
- What's your problem?

16:22.238 --> 16:23.571
It's just a fly.

16:24.535 --> 16:27.040
- I know, I
know I've got this thing

16:27.040 --> 16:28.790
about flies and bugs.

16:31.114 --> 16:33.620
I feel sorry for them.

16:33.620 --> 16:34.530
- I like penguins, but I don't know

16:34.530 --> 16:37.813
if there's penguins in Australia.

16:37.813 --> 16:41.825
For some reason I thought there
were penguins in Australia.

16:41.825 --> 16:43.784
- I think you're like crossing

16:43.784 --> 16:46.795
some kind of ethical boundary here.

16:46.795 --> 16:49.528
- maybe I should go
to Antarctica for penguins.

16:49.528 --> 16:50.361
- Do you think she's cool with

16:50.361 --> 16:52.939
you spying on your relationship?

16:52.939 --> 16:54.830
- Where do you even find penguins?

16:54.830 --> 16:56.747
- I'll stop.

16:56.747 --> 17:00.477
- Yeah, and maybe
delete all of the files.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.669
- I will.

17:01.669 --> 17:04.228
- I guess Australia has more.

17:04.228 --> 17:05.761
- Dude what are you doing?

17:05.761 --> 17:09.054
- I just want to
watch it a couple more times.

17:09.054 --> 17:10.304
- Okay.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.451
- Hey are you lost?

17:18.367 --> 17:20.473
I actually have a property it's just

17:20.473 --> 17:23.488
around the corner from here.

17:23.488 --> 17:25.859
If you need some water,
you know I actually

17:25.859 --> 17:28.903
own a few properties
they're just around here.

17:28.903 --> 17:31.073
I've got two cabins in Idyllwild.

17:31.073 --> 17:35.240
Have you ever have you ever
been up to Idyllwild before?

17:41.953 --> 17:42.786
- Boo.

17:44.554 --> 17:45.387
- Hey.

18:17.814 --> 18:20.397
Brad, did you have a nanny cam?

18:21.466 --> 18:24.732
Were you spying on us with a nanny cam?

18:24.732 --> 18:26.100
Why?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.261
To brag to your friends,
because you're a perv?

18:28.261 --> 18:29.594
Steph was right.

18:32.810 --> 18:33.643
- Gwen,

18:33.643 --> 18:34.476
no, Gwen.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.393
- Okay, opportunity knocks.

18:48.450 --> 18:51.867
Hello, excuse me, I'm sorry are you lost?

18:53.738 --> 18:56.129
- Do you know where Lowell Street is?

18:56.129 --> 18:59.692
- Oh, gosh I hate
that, I'm so sorry for you.

18:59.692 --> 19:00.525
you know what?

19:00.525 --> 19:01.978
Listen, your this isn't the first,

19:01.978 --> 19:04.504
you're not the first person
who gets lost around here.

19:04.504 --> 19:07.528
I've got a property, it's just
around the corner from here,

19:07.528 --> 19:11.731
I'm just saying if you'd like some water.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.314
Oh, hi there cutie.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.257
Fucking bitch!

19:21.107 --> 19:25.329
- Two weeks of this
dude, come on it happens.

19:25.329 --> 19:28.314
I was gonna save this
till the car ride but,

19:28.314 --> 19:31.602
Susie said Stef is going to the party,

19:31.602 --> 19:32.993
and I bet you anything you know who

19:32.993 --> 19:35.376
is gonna be there too.

19:35.376 --> 19:37.628
Be there to drown our
sorrows with cheap vodka

19:37.628 --> 19:41.039
and Hawaiian Punch or maybe make an

19:41.039 --> 19:44.872
ill-fated attempt to
take her mind off of you.

19:51.877 --> 19:55.671
all right, let's put a clean shirt on.

19:55.671 --> 19:58.512
This smells okay, you're
gonna keep the underwear?

19:58.512 --> 20:00.509
Fine, most people don't see that.

20:00.509 --> 20:02.551
Wait, you're not bringing
that thing are you?

20:02.551 --> 20:05.532
The poison that killed your relationship.

20:05.532 --> 20:07.851
Smart move Tiger Woods.

20:07.851 --> 20:08.812
- If she wants to forget about me

20:08.812 --> 20:11.812
I want to know who's trying to help.

20:16.656 --> 20:17.839
- I don't like
this Bradley let's just,

20:17.839 --> 20:19.797
let's just go before they see us.

20:19.797 --> 20:22.214
- Disabling my vocal imprint.

20:23.574 --> 20:26.848
Ladybug is gonna have
to do a search and lock.

20:31.246 --> 20:33.521
- I thought you didn't like the mountains?

20:33.521 --> 20:34.354
- My dad.

20:37.423 --> 20:39.590
I don't know, go anymore.

20:41.635 --> 20:43.628
- So, what brings you to sunny California?

20:43.628 --> 20:45.787
- Well this is where all
the cute boys are of course.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.023
What's a guy like you doing at Seaside?

20:52.023 --> 20:54.284
- Oh, I actually don't go to Seaside,

20:54.284 --> 20:56.650
I own my own business.

20:56.650 --> 20:57.567
- Oh, cool.

20:59.678 --> 21:02.645
- Alright, I'm just going
to go out on a limb, okay?

21:02.645 --> 21:05.946
I happen to know about a
cool cabin up in Idyllwild,

21:05.946 --> 21:08.700
that we can rent for super cheap.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.804
- Idyllwild, is that like hippieville?

21:10.804 --> 21:11.637
- I got to go in there.

21:11.637 --> 21:15.107
- No, no, no effin' way, you're
totally gonna freak her out.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.247
- If we leave tomorrow
we might make it before

21:16.247 --> 21:18.612
the freaks book up all the good cabins.

21:18.612 --> 21:19.673
What do you say?

21:19.673 --> 21:21.050
- Tomorrow?

21:21.050 --> 21:21.967
- I'm down.

21:23.193 --> 21:24.630
- I don't know Stef.

21:24.630 --> 21:26.486
There's school Monday.

21:26.486 --> 21:30.236
- Oh we're making up
credits in summer school

21:31.697 --> 21:33.844
and like all that fun stuff.

21:33.844 --> 21:36.710
- Reactivate your vocal imprint.

21:36.710 --> 21:39.654
- It's not gonna hear
me from down the hall.

21:39.654 --> 21:40.848
Now I have to go in there and talk to her.

21:40.848 --> 21:41.681
- Wait, no, no, no, no.

21:41.681 --> 21:42.514
- Right?

21:42.514 --> 21:43.584
- That's so cool.

21:43.584 --> 21:44.671
- I promise then to have you guys

21:44.671 --> 21:46.600
back on time all right?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.183
- I'll use my voice

21:49.067 --> 21:52.125
- Then she's gonna see you and
know that something's weird.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.173
- Well we've been thinking about it,

21:53.173 --> 21:54.890
so we think we're gonna go.

21:54.890 --> 21:55.723
- Yeah.

21:55.723 --> 21:56.556
- You're going.

21:56.556 --> 21:57.389
- Yeah.

21:57.389 --> 21:58.222
- Definitely.

21:58.222 --> 21:59.055
- That's perfect.

21:59.055 --> 21:59.888
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.

21:59.888 --> 22:01.824
- I'm deactivating the voice imprint.

22:01.824 --> 22:03.889
- Then your bug will float free.

22:07.549 --> 22:09.966
- Wait for me by the mailbox.

22:13.149 --> 22:14.185
Excuse me.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.517
This party sucks!

22:32.772 --> 22:34.523
- Middle of the
night, at the top of your lungs.

22:34.523 --> 22:36.943
- It's cool man,
we're sorry if we woke you.

22:36.943 --> 22:39.091
- You didn't wake
me man, I just like to stand

22:39.091 --> 22:41.248
here in the moonlight my bathrobe.

22:41.248 --> 22:44.641
- I apologize for that
sir it won't happen again.

22:44.641 --> 22:46.041
- Yeah we said we're sorry.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.288
- Get in the car Peter.

22:47.288 --> 22:48.771
- I'm not even awake yet.

22:48.771 --> 22:50.864
where are we going?

22:50.864 --> 22:53.614
- Just pull over, pull over here.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.269
- So, you gonna
tell me what this plan is?

22:58.269 --> 22:59.877
- Just wait.

22:59.877 --> 23:01.811
she should be coming down.

23:01.811 --> 23:03.942
- I knew this was about her.

23:03.942 --> 23:07.109
- Sink down, use your phone.

23:09.482 --> 23:12.065
- What a douche, what a weirdo.

23:24.595 --> 23:28.762
Stephanie too, oh man now she's
gonna think I'm a stalker.

23:30.155 --> 23:30.988
- We are.

23:34.135 --> 23:36.689
They're actually going
with these two assholes.

23:36.689 --> 23:39.611
- You told me we
were gonna get doughnuts.

23:39.611 --> 23:43.610
- One of us has got to go
over there and plant the bug.

23:43.610 --> 23:44.978
Guess which one.

23:44.978 --> 23:46.443
- You because I'm out.

23:46.443 --> 23:48.776
- That's right me.

23:50.231 --> 23:51.773
Keep the video recording.

23:51.773 --> 23:53.556
Keep it going.

23:53.556 --> 23:54.389
Just in case they try to start some shit.

23:54.389 --> 23:55.850
- Wait, where are you going?

23:55.850 --> 23:56.683
- Keep it going.

23:56.683 --> 23:59.089
- You can't go there.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.025
Don't be a super creep.

24:08.244 --> 24:12.411
- I'm so sorry I needed
to apologize to you, okay?

24:13.571 --> 24:14.909
I'm sorry.

24:14.909 --> 24:15.909
- Okay Brad.

24:17.795 --> 24:19.541
Okay Brad, you're really sweaty.

24:28.211 --> 24:29.044
What the fuck?

24:29.044 --> 24:30.535
- May be a creeper.

24:39.033 --> 24:42.338
- What happened, what happened?

24:42.338 --> 24:43.303
- Follow 'em.

24:43.303 --> 24:44.136
- Where to?

24:44.136 --> 24:45.730
- Just drive Peter.

24:53.023 --> 24:54.301
- How did you guys
even find out where I live?

24:54.301 --> 24:55.884
- It's easy.

24:56.959 --> 24:59.668
- Why is he here?

24:59.668 --> 25:01.041
- Excuse me, I've been watching you

25:01.041 --> 25:02.889
for the past 30 minutes, watching you

25:02.889 --> 25:05.056
spy on my neighbor's house

25:07.445 --> 25:08.278
- Say it now,

25:08.278 --> 25:09.111
- Stop.

25:09.111 --> 25:10.944
- say it now!

25:15.691 --> 25:16.836
- I thought you
were the one, you were doing

25:16.836 --> 25:18.717
so well, you're just like all the others.

25:18.717 --> 25:19.550
- No.

25:19.550 --> 25:21.550
- You're filth!

25:28.538 --> 25:30.628
- Why are you doing this to me?

25:30.628 --> 25:31.628
I'm not her.

25:33.356 --> 25:34.356
I'm not her!

25:39.524 --> 25:40.449
- Okay, anyways,
last thing Gwen needs

25:40.449 --> 25:41.884
is Brad on her mind.

25:41.884 --> 25:43.094
- We need to get some drinks.

25:43.094 --> 25:44.296
- Yes.

25:44.296 --> 25:45.253
- Everybody down for drinks?

25:45.253 --> 25:46.086
- Yes.

25:46.086 --> 25:46.919
- All right.

25:46.919 --> 25:48.752
- Is that okay?

25:52.811 --> 25:55.732
- We're going Idyllwild aren't we?

25:55.732 --> 25:58.615
- You don't have
to if you don't want to.

25:58.615 --> 26:01.398
- Well, whatever happens
this is gonna be a weekend

26:01.398 --> 26:03.571
that we're gonna remember.

26:03.571 --> 26:04.404
All right?

26:16.755 --> 26:17.870
- Stay in the car.

26:17.870 --> 26:18.870
- I got to piss.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.510
- You can piss
when we get out to the woods.

26:21.510 --> 26:24.010
Where no none else can see me.

26:43.922 --> 26:46.325
- What's the matter?

26:46.325 --> 26:47.158
- Nothing.

26:48.280 --> 26:52.280
- I hate seeing this
brooding look on your face,

26:54.138 --> 26:58.305
it's not cute, I mean it's cute
'cause it's you, but smile,

27:01.009 --> 27:04.092
it's not worth it, he's not worth it.

27:05.692 --> 27:06.633
Let's have fun.

27:06.633 --> 27:07.800
- Okay.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.322
- I'm shy, I
don't know how to behave.

27:17.322 --> 27:18.173
around other people.

27:18.173 --> 27:19.734
- Say it, say it!

27:19.734 --> 27:20.567
Goddammit.

27:21.475 --> 27:22.725
- Stop!

27:24.613 --> 27:28.617
- Say it, I'm
shy and I don't know how

27:28.617 --> 27:31.117
to behave around other people.

27:36.402 --> 27:38.247
- I'm shy and I don't know.

27:38.247 --> 27:39.830
- I'm shy!

27:40.778 --> 27:43.746
- I'm shy and I don't know.

27:43.746 --> 27:45.949
- I'm shy and I
don't know how to behave

27:45.949 --> 27:48.366
around other people like you!

28:05.520 --> 28:08.588

28:31.133 --> 28:33.290
- Look, do you see where this car is?

28:33.290 --> 28:34.123
This car.

28:35.552 --> 28:36.385
- No way.

28:37.562 --> 28:39.276
- Something tells me
that's creepy stalker dude

28:39.276 --> 28:41.372
spying on us again.

28:41.372 --> 28:43.380
- Why would Gwen's
boyfriend be following us?

28:43.380 --> 28:45.297
- Stop, stop.

28:47.213 --> 28:48.234
What are they doing?

28:48.234 --> 28:50.382
- I don't know

28:50.382 --> 28:51.963
- Where are you going?

28:51.963 --> 28:54.524
- Watch me dust this stupid Toyota.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.466
- What the hell?

28:55.466 --> 28:57.783
Shit, go, go, go, go, go, go.

28:57.783 --> 28:58.893
- Know where we are.

28:58.893 --> 28:59.802
- I know exactly where I am.

28:59.802 --> 29:00.946
- You
knew where Idyllwild was,

29:00.946 --> 29:01.974
you don't know where this is.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.348
- I've been down
this so many times, please,

29:04.348 --> 29:06.495
look, we're ditching the guy.

29:06.495 --> 29:07.923
- They're getting away Peter.

29:07.923 --> 29:09.106
- There's a bumpy road.

29:09.106 --> 29:10.435
- I know where I'm going.

29:10.435 --> 29:11.268
- The right direction,

29:11.268 --> 29:12.101
how are we gonna turn around?

29:12.101 --> 29:12.961
- This is the fastest.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.061
- You're gonna lose them Peter!

29:14.061 --> 29:15.544
- I just see
a cloud of smoke behind us,

29:15.544 --> 29:17.081
there's no way he's following us.

29:17.081 --> 29:17.967
- They're way out there.

29:17.967 --> 29:18.800
- Where?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.667
- We're leaving
a trail of dust behind us.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.250
- Easy, easy, easy.

29:23.358 --> 29:24.191
- Shit, shit.

29:24.191 --> 29:26.736
- Pull up to the left of us.

29:26.736 --> 29:28.523
- Come on Peter,
you're gonna lose them.

29:28.523 --> 29:30.009
- Are you done dusting them yet?

29:30.009 --> 29:33.092
- I think we're out of here.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.474
- What are you doing?

29:36.474 --> 29:37.594
- Asshole.

29:37.594 --> 29:38.427
- You're gonna lose them Peter.

29:38.427 --> 29:41.772
- Bradley I lost them
what do you want from me?

29:41.772 --> 29:44.231
- Look, if we lose the
signal, it's not, the

29:44.231 --> 29:45.748
fly, it's gonna search aimlessly

29:45.748 --> 29:48.071
around for its home base Peter.

29:48.071 --> 29:49.302
- Yeah, he turned the wrong way.

29:49.302 --> 29:50.615
He turned the wrong way.

29:50.615 --> 29:51.811
Oh!

29:51.811 --> 29:52.815
That was awesome.

29:52.815 --> 29:53.825
- That was not awesome.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.208
- Oh my God.

29:55.208 --> 29:56.598
- Wasn't it voice locked on Gwen?

29:56.598 --> 29:59.163
- Yeah, but if it loses its
base signal it won't have

29:59.163 --> 30:00.817
anywhere to send the video data.

30:00.817 --> 30:01.650
- Dude, how sick was that?

30:01.650 --> 30:02.483
- Not sick.

30:02.483 --> 30:03.316
- How sick was that?

30:03.316 --> 30:04.149
- Not even a little sick.

30:04.149 --> 30:05.149
- Oh my God.

30:07.629 --> 30:08.578
- Well what's the range?

30:08.578 --> 30:10.266
- About a mile.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.783
- So, you're saying we don't

30:11.783 --> 30:13.123
know where they're going, or where they

30:13.123 --> 30:15.872
are, but we have to be within
a mile of wherever that is?

30:15.872 --> 30:16.705
- Yeah.

30:18.437 --> 30:19.777
- Let's party.

30:32.395 --> 30:33.514
- What is this?

30:33.514 --> 30:35.131
- Armenian cucumbers.

30:35.131 --> 30:36.908
- Armenian cucumbers,
do they taste different?

30:36.908 --> 30:41.075
- They're a little
bit brown inside, very mellow.

30:44.529 --> 30:45.911
- Stefanie are you serious?

30:45.911 --> 30:47.046
- I think we would need these.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.592
- Doesn't the bug
have GPS or something?

30:48.592 --> 30:53.150
- Software says it does but I
don't have the right hardware.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.446
It's probably sending coordinates

30:54.446 --> 30:56.309
but I'm not set to receive them.

30:56.309 --> 30:59.408
- This place is weird I would
never come here by myself.

30:59.408 --> 31:00.641
- You serious.

31:00.641 --> 31:03.394
You were a pretty easy
sell back then Stef.

31:03.394 --> 31:05.780
- I need to import fly
program into your Notebook.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.412
- Why?

31:07.412 --> 31:10.283
- So that you can monitor
the bug camera too.

31:10.283 --> 31:11.714
- For when you go to the
bathroom or something?

31:11.714 --> 31:13.126
- Listen, there may come a point

31:13.126 --> 31:15.159
when I have to go in there and rescue her.

31:15.159 --> 31:16.745
- Are you serious like those two are

31:16.745 --> 31:19.018
Charles Manson types or something?

31:19.018 --> 31:20.579
Look, I understand that you're curious and

31:20.579 --> 31:23.839
everything, but frankly
this is all kind of sad now.

31:23.839 --> 31:26.212
If you, you just need to get a life.

31:26.212 --> 31:27.295
And let her live hers you can't

31:27.295 --> 31:28.942
control what you can't control.

31:28.942 --> 31:30.438
- Are you done?

31:30.438 --> 31:32.946
Give me your Notebook.

31:32.946 --> 31:34.363
- Fine, whatever,

31:35.365 --> 31:37.970
do your little backyard James Bond thing.

31:37.970 --> 31:38.803
I'm sure your dad will be

31:38.803 --> 31:41.799
really proud about how
you're using all his stuff.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.949
- If Liam goes into
any James Taylor covers

31:43.949 --> 31:45.359
I will literally kill myself.

31:45.359 --> 31:46.192
- Me too.

31:46.192 --> 31:47.025
Suicide pact.

31:47.025 --> 31:47.858
- Yes I'm down.

31:47.858 --> 31:49.035
- Deal.

31:49.035 --> 31:51.378
- I'm gonna go get a
coffee, you want something?

31:51.378 --> 31:53.140
- Don't go too far.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.223
- I get that.

31:55.695 --> 31:56.694
- This looks like a dead end.

31:56.694 --> 31:57.527
- This does look like a dead end.

31:57.527 --> 31:58.707
- You're
sure this is the right way?

31:58.707 --> 32:01.279
- No, but you're supposed
to be navigating, so.

32:01.279 --> 32:02.340
- Well I
didn't tell you to turn here.

32:02.340 --> 32:03.544
- I'm not gonna lie man,

32:03.544 --> 32:04.393
this looks a little sketchy.

32:04.393 --> 32:05.886
- This is super sketchy.

32:05.886 --> 32:08.263
There's a bunch of abandoned vehicles.

32:08.263 --> 32:11.153
- Maybe we should.

32:11.153 --> 32:11.990
- Alright, let's pull off right here,

32:11.990 --> 32:14.359
there's a lake, you can squat
and pee in a lake, can't you?

32:14.359 --> 32:15.869
- I don't wanna pee in the lake.

32:15.869 --> 32:17.062
- Well it ain't like
it's gonna hurt the fish.

32:17.062 --> 32:20.301
You gonna pee on the side of the road?

32:20.301 --> 32:23.028
- I don't think I
can scale a wall to pee.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.992
Can we go swimming here,
is there an actual lake?

32:24.992 --> 32:26.596
- No you can't go swimming,

32:26.596 --> 32:28.931
it's not here, we're not gonna go here.

32:28.931 --> 32:30.812
- Wait, you're going off fast.

32:30.812 --> 32:33.001
- Doesn't feel like
this is gonna end well.

32:33.001 --> 32:33.887
- Shh.

32:35.705 --> 32:36.737
- What did I say?

32:36.737 --> 32:37.570
- Thanks Clay.

32:37.570 --> 32:39.987
- Welcome to paradise.

32:40.957 --> 32:44.052
- Okay, this I could work with.

32:44.052 --> 32:46.135
- Get out of here.

32:51.736 --> 32:55.236
- Come on Gwen this is nice, falls.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.143
- You want to get in?

33:00.143 --> 33:04.143
I'm coming, I'm coming,
let me get my pants off.

33:10.583 --> 33:14.260
- I can't just sit here and watch this.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.485
- What else are you gonna do?

33:17.485 --> 33:19.923
- Go to the police, I don't know.

33:19.923 --> 33:21.884
- And tell them what?

33:21.884 --> 33:24.781
Hey, officer those who
picked up my girlfriend, can

33:24.781 --> 33:28.451
you arrest this other guy
for putting the moves on her?

33:28.451 --> 33:29.565
- Hey Gwen, hop in.

33:34.189 --> 33:35.390
- You guys coming in or what?

33:35.390 --> 33:36.291
- No!

33:36.291 --> 33:37.708
- You want a hug?

33:48.608 --> 33:49.441
- Stef?

33:59.140 --> 33:59.973
Stef!

34:01.813 --> 34:03.396
Stef where are you?

34:12.873 --> 34:13.956
Oh forget it.

34:51.929 --> 34:54.362
- You got a bug on your neck.

34:54.362 --> 34:55.196
- Where?

35:01.027 --> 35:02.489
No I didn't.

35:02.489 --> 35:04.406
- I swear it was a bug.

35:11.970 --> 35:12.803
Come on.

35:14.258 --> 35:18.843
Stef said you never let
yourself have any fun.

35:18.843 --> 35:20.843
I have the same problem.

35:21.955 --> 35:24.705
Maybe we can help each other out?

35:26.627 --> 35:28.210
- I don't think so.

35:30.256 --> 35:31.319
Thanks, Clay.

35:31.319 --> 35:33.841
But, you're nice, what are you doing?

35:33.841 --> 35:34.758
Help, help!

35:38.863 --> 35:39.696
Stop!

35:45.759 --> 35:47.094
- Shit.

35:47.094 --> 35:47.927
- Oh no.

35:50.304 --> 35:51.186
- What do we do?

35:51.186 --> 35:52.436
- I don't know.

36:09.339 --> 36:10.186
- Is that where the waterfall is?

36:10.186 --> 36:11.436
- I don't know.

36:38.346 --> 36:39.429
- Clay, Clay?

36:43.025 --> 36:43.858
What?

36:45.736 --> 36:46.569
What?

36:46.569 --> 36:47.402
- Where are you from?

36:47.402 --> 36:48.821
- Yo Clay!

36:48.821 --> 36:50.003
Clay!

36:50.003 --> 36:51.653
- Gwen.

36:51.653 --> 36:53.515
- Clay!

36:53.515 --> 36:54.362
- Wait they're over here.

36:54.362 --> 36:55.195
- Stef!

36:55.195 --> 36:56.224
- Oh what's up Gwen?

36:56.224 --> 36:57.057
- Stef!

36:57.057 --> 36:59.390
- Gwen, where's Clay?

37:02.962 --> 37:04.400
- Where's Clay at?

37:04.400 --> 37:05.233
Hello.

37:07.818 --> 37:09.065
- Where's Clay?

37:09.065 --> 37:09.898
- What's,

37:11.309 --> 37:12.450
what's going on?

37:12.450 --> 37:15.668
What's up man, where's
Clay, who's this guy?

37:15.668 --> 37:16.501
How you doing?

37:16.501 --> 37:17.334
- You're friend needs to calm down,

37:17.334 --> 37:19.122
he was acting a little feisty.

37:19.122 --> 37:19.955
- Clay?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.031
- What, no way dude where's Clay?

37:24.871 --> 37:27.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

37:27.572 --> 37:28.758
What is this, where's Clay?

37:28.758 --> 37:29.591
Clay!

37:30.680 --> 37:32.251
Are you serious right now.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.996
Dude, where do you think you're going?

37:33.996 --> 37:35.473
- Stef, let's go.

37:35.473 --> 37:36.306
- Get over here.

37:36.306 --> 37:37.139
- Gwen, what's gotten into you?

37:37.139 --> 37:37.972
We can't just leave.

37:37.972 --> 37:40.409
Wait, did something really happen?

37:40.409 --> 37:41.729
- Clay!

37:41.729 --> 37:42.562
- Where are they going?

37:42.562 --> 37:43.462
Let's go.

37:43.462 --> 37:46.379
- No, no, stay here, I'm not going.

37:48.142 --> 37:51.725
- Fine, just stay here,
I'll be right back.

38:08.676 --> 38:09.903
- God!

38:09.903 --> 38:10.736
- Stef!

38:12.803 --> 38:13.720
Stef, Stef.

38:15.050 --> 38:17.300
- Goddammit, dammit!

40:16.095 --> 40:17.717
- Turn left.

40:17.717 --> 40:18.690
- This left?

40:18.690 --> 40:19.668
- Turn left.

40:19.668 --> 40:20.756
- This doesn't
lead to the waterfall.

40:20.756 --> 40:21.684
- We're not going to the
waterfall, we're not gonna find

40:21.684 --> 40:23.073
her in time, but the police will.

40:23.073 --> 40:23.906
You're clear.

40:23.906 --> 40:25.320
- So that's it, we're
cut off the bug is dead?

40:25.320 --> 40:26.484
- I don't know.

40:26.484 --> 40:27.771
- What do you man you don't know?

40:27.771 --> 40:29.287
- It's a sophisticated
piece of micro technology.

40:29.287 --> 40:32.003
What'd you think it would
do when it gets wet?

40:32.003 --> 40:36.927
My dad didn't leave me an
owner's manual for the thing.

40:36.927 --> 40:39.510
- Well maybe not at home,
government property's

40:39.510 --> 40:42.812
supposed to be confiscated
or destroyed isn't it?

40:42.812 --> 40:43.991
Man, we wouldn't be in any of this mess

40:43.991 --> 40:45.654
if it wasn't for that thing!

40:45.654 --> 40:48.821
- It's my fault, this is all my fault.

40:50.309 --> 40:51.142
If I wouldn't of gotten jealous

40:51.142 --> 40:53.225
and tried to spy on her.

40:54.443 --> 40:55.440
- Don't flatter yourself,
she still might have

40:55.440 --> 40:57.797
gone out with those chumps.

40:57.797 --> 41:00.382
- Not if she hadn't broken up with me.

41:00.382 --> 41:04.201
- Okay, you're the
asshole, bad this is just so bad.

41:04.201 --> 41:06.406
- Right, right, right,
go right, a cop, a cop,

41:06.406 --> 41:07.428
- He's giving someone a ticket.

41:07.428 --> 41:09.345
- Just pull over Peter.

41:11.689 --> 41:12.689
- No!

41:18.405 --> 41:20.614
- What the hell is this
some kind of drone camera?

41:20.614 --> 41:23.987
- Bug camera, it's a bug camera.

41:23.987 --> 41:25.070
- Bug camera.

41:53.015 --> 41:54.182
- Help!

41:55.832 --> 41:56.665
Someone,

41:59.115 --> 41:59.948
help!

43:16.672 --> 43:19.839
- You should go see him today.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.583
Look, I understand your hesitation.

43:35.230 --> 43:38.625
- What is this I'm supposed
to be watching now?

43:38.625 --> 43:41.490
- Nothing, the bug camera
went dormant, solar-powered

43:41.490 --> 43:45.961
so after an hour in the
dark it goes to sleep.

43:45.961 --> 43:48.621
- Can you get me a license
plate off this thing?

43:48.621 --> 43:51.782
Maybe a signpost or something, any kind of

43:51.782 --> 43:55.949
recognizable landmark that we
can use to track and locate?

43:56.838 --> 43:58.172
- We don't know this town.

43:58.172 --> 44:00.839
All we see are trees and houses.

44:05.663 --> 44:06.750
- Do you mind if one of us takes

44:06.750 --> 44:08.981
a closer look at your footage?

44:08.981 --> 44:10.433
Maybe we can freeze frame and spot

44:10.433 --> 44:13.885
a house address or
something, that way we can

44:13.885 --> 44:17.255
at least narrow down the search area.

44:17.255 --> 44:19.690
Idyllwild has a population of about

44:19.690 --> 44:22.766
15,000, and that doesn't include the

44:22.766 --> 44:25.098
thousands of tourists that come and go

44:25.098 --> 44:27.983
and there's about 800 houses and cabins

44:27.983 --> 44:29.315
most of which are going to be empty

44:29.315 --> 44:31.987
off season, so the prospect of going

44:31.987 --> 44:34.254
around knocking on 300 hundred doors,

44:34.254 --> 44:36.505
most of which are gonna be empty is not

44:36.505 --> 44:40.009
in our budget, we need something, we need

44:40.009 --> 44:43.307
something to give us an
advantage to give us a break.

44:43.307 --> 44:45.390
does this thing have GPS?

44:46.750 --> 44:49.880
- Don't even start, he says it has it but,

44:49.880 --> 44:53.008
we don't have the proper
software on the laptop.

44:53.008 --> 44:56.137
- I need to know if she's still alive.

44:56.137 --> 44:57.453
- Why don't you guys settle into one

44:57.453 --> 44:58.776
of our local cabins and call me if

44:58.776 --> 45:00.727
something new happens okay?

45:00.727 --> 45:04.560
We'll make a couple
copies of the footage too.

Hey.

47:46.976 --> 47:47.893
Help, help!

47:53.444 --> 47:55.611
Someone, someone, help me!

48:16.378 --> 48:18.795
- You tried storing all this?

48:20.089 --> 48:21.922
We need to back it up.

48:26.362 --> 48:28.281
- What are you doing?

48:28.281 --> 48:30.678
- I left it in the car.

48:30.678 --> 48:31.511
- Okay.

48:32.588 --> 48:36.755
Are you sure the police are
gonna be here any minute?

48:40.673 --> 48:41.923
- What are you?

48:43.076 --> 48:44.159
What are you?

48:51.635 --> 48:53.515
Wait, it's okay.

48:58.549 --> 49:01.601
- I think I know where she is.

49:01.601 --> 49:04.125
- You think you can help me?

49:04.125 --> 49:06.292
You think you can help me?

49:07.832 --> 49:08.665
Alright.

49:21.779 --> 49:23.243
- She's going to crush
it, when is she gonna

49:23.243 --> 49:27.126
recognize that that little fucker is us?

49:27.126 --> 49:30.491
- All I need is for her to talk to us.

49:30.491 --> 49:31.991
Tell us something.

49:33.857 --> 49:35.020
The power switch.

49:35.020 --> 49:36.101
- What?

49:36.101 --> 49:37.100
- Remember, if I cut

49:37.100 --> 49:38.747
off the signal feed, the red light on

49:38.747 --> 49:40.197
and should come on.

49:40.197 --> 49:41.212
- What are you talking about?

49:41.212 --> 49:42.638
- If we cut off the signal we might

49:42.638 --> 49:44.534
not get it back it's too risky, man.

49:44.534 --> 49:46.444
- It's the only way I can talk to her.

49:46.444 --> 49:47.694
- Look, you you're not thinking straight.

49:47.694 --> 49:49.844
you need to eat something okay, 'cause

49:49.844 --> 49:51.690
you're not making any sense.

49:51.690 --> 49:53.111
In fact I could use something to eat,

49:53.111 --> 49:54.448
maybe a Twinkie or something.

49:54.448 --> 49:55.652
- Morse code.

49:55.652 --> 49:56.814
- What?

49:56.814 --> 49:58.114
- I'll show you.

49:58.114 --> 49:59.672
Look, if I cut off the signal the red

49:59.672 --> 50:02.948
light comes on it's just like your Wi-Fi.

50:02.948 --> 50:05.615
And then if I click it on again.

50:07.841 --> 50:09.465
- Oh shit they're here.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.129
- This better be good.

50:11.129 --> 50:13.212
- Yes sir, it's all here.

50:15.611 --> 50:16.534
- What is this what is?

50:16.534 --> 50:17.626
What is this we're watching?

50:17.626 --> 50:21.126
- We don't know. that's the whole problem.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.779
- Either you guys are perpetrating
a very clever hoax for

50:24.779 --> 50:28.520
which you will be summarily
fined, and jailed,

50:28.520 --> 50:30.150
surveillance equipment for a crime

50:30.150 --> 50:32.154
that's about to occur and
we'll have to confiscate it.

50:32.154 --> 50:33.506
- What, you can't do that!

50:33.506 --> 50:35.235
- We can and we will, look our guys

50:35.235 --> 50:38.054
are the exact people to solve the crime.

50:38.054 --> 50:39.887
- You didn't believe us about
the other people though.

50:39.887 --> 50:42.431
- I told you kids to calm down.

50:42.431 --> 50:44.484
- Listen,
just give me the camera.

50:44.484 --> 50:45.901
- No, no, no.

50:45.901 --> 50:47.774
You're not taking my computer, I'm gonna

50:47.774 --> 50:49.678
smash it to pieces right here right now.

50:49.678 --> 50:51.819
- Don't get excited, just just calm down,

50:51.819 --> 50:52.652
give me the camera.

50:52.652 --> 50:54.679
- No, no I go where the computer goes,

50:54.679 --> 50:57.142
or I'm gonna break it.

50:57.142 --> 50:58.210
- Look, you don't want
to do that, if you do

50:58.210 --> 51:01.119
then you break the only
link we have to the girl,

51:01.119 --> 51:02.452
wherever she is.

51:04.675 --> 51:07.598
- I'm sorry sir, I cannot
give you, I cannot do it.

51:07.598 --> 51:08.931
- What the hell.

51:09.844 --> 51:11.927
- Hey, get off me please.

51:15.423 --> 51:17.923
- Don't shoot him!

51:59.034 --> 52:02.451
- Pay attention Gwen, I'm talking to you.

52:09.341 --> 52:10.174
I

52:12.581 --> 52:13.414
am

52:15.711 --> 52:16.544
here

52:18.508 --> 52:19.341
for

52:21.425 --> 52:22.258
you.

52:25.784 --> 52:27.617
- Bradley is that you?

52:29.139 --> 52:32.222
- Dammit Gwen, just shut up and look.

52:34.106 --> 52:36.689
- Is this your robot nanny cam?

52:40.536 --> 52:43.619
- Oh shit, shit, shit, hurry up Gwen,

52:44.575 --> 52:46.908
Gwen talk to me, talk to me.

52:51.178 --> 52:53.011
- Are you watching me?

52:54.478 --> 52:58.026
- Tell me anything,
about the house anything,

52:58.026 --> 53:00.743
number on the mailbox, you
must have seen something,

53:00.743 --> 53:01.576
Gwen.

53:02.738 --> 53:05.071
- Have you been watching me?

53:07.713 --> 53:09.296
Through everything?

53:10.222 --> 53:14.389
- You can't hear me, just, you
can't fucking mind, can you?

53:21.978 --> 53:22.811
No.

53:24.698 --> 53:28.365
- Why don't you get me
the fuck out of here?

53:35.040 --> 53:37.123
- Who are you talking to?

53:39.008 --> 53:41.258
I brought you a cup of tea.

53:52.536 --> 53:54.036
You don't want it.

54:04.151 --> 54:08.318
Why can't you act the way your
mother told you how to act?

54:09.155 --> 54:12.405
I'm shy, and sometimes I don't know how

54:13.437 --> 54:15.604
to be horny around people.

54:19.092 --> 54:20.511
Say it.

54:20.511 --> 54:22.693
With my ankles, move up my leg.

54:22.693 --> 54:23.526
- No.

54:25.193 --> 54:27.776
- Start with my ankle.

54:29.817 --> 54:31.311
- I need to be,

54:31.311 --> 54:33.144
- Around other people.

54:45.178 --> 54:48.345
There now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

54:50.296 --> 54:52.879
Now, say the whole thing again.

54:57.211 --> 54:58.044
I'm shy.

55:10.138 --> 55:11.888
You see, you are shy.

55:13.981 --> 55:18.148
You get all tongue tied
when you're around people.

55:19.042 --> 55:20.709
You want to impress.

55:45.922 --> 55:47.598
- They're gonna find me, and they're gonna

55:47.598 --> 55:50.681
stick you in the ground till you rot.

55:56.748 --> 55:58.915
- They can look all they want

55:58.915 --> 56:00.422
you slept a good long bit from that pill

56:00.422 --> 56:03.829
I gave you we could be anywhere west of

56:03.829 --> 56:06.102
the Rockies we could be anywhere in

56:06.102 --> 56:09.321
Nevada right now for all you know.

56:09.321 --> 56:12.253
Anywhere, how do you know?

56:12.253 --> 56:14.621
You really think the police
are gonna search half

56:14.621 --> 56:18.204
the United States for
an '84 Buick Skyhawk?

56:31.454 --> 56:32.431
- Your wife's upstairs?

56:32.431 --> 56:33.592
- She's upstairs sir.

56:33.592 --> 56:35.003
- Okay, is there
anyone else in the family?

56:35.003 --> 56:37.811
- Bradley show any signs of
anti social behavior in school?

56:37.811 --> 56:38.985
- Strange car?

56:38.985 --> 56:43.316
- Yeah, like a Buick sedan,
or a Chevy or something

56:43.316 --> 56:45.719
I don't know, like one of those older.

56:45.719 --> 56:49.802
- He won't return my texts,
he gets in his moods.

56:50.800 --> 56:51.706
- Is this your car right here?

56:51.706 --> 56:52.776
- Yeah.

56:52.776 --> 56:56.839
- You guys got a
place to stay for the night?

56:56.839 --> 56:58.105
- Yeah.

56:58.105 --> 57:01.194
- He's always been kind of
a one-track mind kind of guy

57:01.194 --> 57:04.275
he just sometimes goes
off to his own world.

57:04.275 --> 57:06.525
- What do you mean by that?

57:09.013 --> 57:10.925
- Sir, I don't have it, but I
can give you my license number

57:10.925 --> 57:13.301
I know my driver's
license number, is that?

57:13.301 --> 57:14.730
- Would you mind
stepping out of the car sir?

57:14.730 --> 57:16.386
- Do I have to?

57:16.386 --> 57:19.214
- He's just trying to
prove something to his dad,

57:19.214 --> 57:22.273
only thing is his dad's never
gonna be able to see it,

57:22.273 --> 57:25.106
to appreciate it, he's a good guy.

57:29.005 --> 57:32.635
- You're going crazy in here aren't you?

57:32.635 --> 57:35.477
Hey do you need anything, baby?

57:35.477 --> 57:37.142
Hey!

57:39.515 --> 57:40.848
Repeat after me.

57:46.367 --> 57:47.200
I'm shy,

57:48.438 --> 57:49.442
and sometimes.

57:49.442 --> 57:50.406
- And sometimes,

57:50.406 --> 57:53.906
- I don't know, listen to me baby, listen,

57:55.284 --> 57:57.117
I love you sweetheart.

58:02.901 --> 58:06.420
If you only would've listened to me Laura,

58:06.420 --> 58:08.325
before that man took you.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.117
I told you,

58:11.149 --> 58:14.711
being shy and introverted was okay.

58:16.889 --> 58:19.443
Just like I was when I was your age.

58:19.443 --> 58:21.110
I need you to be me!

58:21.110 --> 58:22.437
You had to pretend you were

58:22.437 --> 58:25.139
every horny teenage boys darling.

58:25.139 --> 58:27.458
I couldn't protect you.

58:27.458 --> 58:29.946
What kind of father who can't

58:29.946 --> 58:32.448
protect his one and only daughter.

58:33.679 --> 58:37.571
I'll teach you how to
behave around all those men.

58:37.571 --> 58:38.468
- I'm not her.

58:38.468 --> 58:42.368
- It's the only way I
know you'll be safe now.

58:42.368 --> 58:44.954
- I'm not your sister.

58:44.954 --> 58:46.121
I'm not Laura!

59:05.312 --> 59:07.602
- If your friend's car's been stolen why

59:07.602 --> 59:09.409
can't the police just search the area

59:09.409 --> 59:11.326
for a brown Dodge dark?

59:12.599 --> 59:14.123
- Buick Skylark.

59:14.123 --> 59:16.540
- Well okay, a Buick Skylark.

59:18.152 --> 59:22.223
- They've got more important
cases to solve apparently.

59:22.223 --> 59:23.306
- Well, okay.

59:24.454 --> 59:25.959
- Stop here!

59:25.959 --> 59:26.972
- But you said.

59:26.972 --> 59:28.349
- Stop here, I'm sorry I think I just

59:28.349 --> 59:31.099
recognized where my friend lives.

59:31.948 --> 59:36.837
- Your phone doesn't work, I
can make a phone call for you.

59:36.837 --> 59:38.490
- Oh, no, no, no that's oka, thank you sir

59:38.490 --> 59:39.670
this is great.

59:39.670 --> 59:40.753
- Well, okay.

01:00:46.481 --> 01:00:49.242
- I'm gonna open up my legs,

01:00:49.242 --> 01:00:52.992
clean the bad parts and
then I use the sponge

01:00:55.124 --> 01:00:56.707
to clean my tongue.

01:00:57.734 --> 01:01:00.250
- It's okay, you're at your

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:03.417
best when you just do what I tell you.

01:01:07.017 --> 01:01:09.308
I'm shy and sometimes I don't know

01:01:09.308 --> 01:01:11.641
how to behave around people.

01:01:14.955 --> 01:01:16.455
- I'm shy.

01:01:26.428 --> 01:01:29.928
- And I don't know how to behave,

01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:32.625
- Behave.

01:01:33.586 --> 01:01:35.669
- How to behave.

01:01:37.234 --> 01:01:38.567
- How to behave.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.929
- What am I doing here?

01:01:46.929 --> 01:01:49.929
- I'm shy and I don't know.

01:01:52.685 --> 01:01:53.781
- Fuck you!

01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:55.849
- I'm shy and I
don't know how to behave

01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:59.182
around other people, say it, say it now!

01:02:00.057 --> 01:02:00.974
Say it now!

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.587
Sometimes, I have to be stern, but even

01:02:08.587 --> 01:02:12.398
when I get angry, know that I love you,

01:02:12.398 --> 01:02:16.087
know that it's only for you sweetheart,

01:02:16.087 --> 01:02:19.919
even if I slap you, or twist you up,

01:02:19.919 --> 01:02:23.836
or tie you up, it's just
a help you sweetheart.

01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:25.704
Yes.

01:02:35.617 --> 01:02:37.117
Everything is bad!

01:02:44.702 --> 01:02:45.535
Hey.

01:03:02.427 --> 01:03:06.094
I thought you might
like some hot chocolate.

01:03:14.894 --> 01:03:17.644
I promise not to throw it on you.

01:03:19.306 --> 01:03:23.473
I would never want to waste
a good cup of hot chocolate,

01:03:27.176 --> 01:03:29.426
all right more for me then.

01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:51.566
You know I've been thinking,
been doing a lot of thinking,

01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:54.733
and I've decided I'm gonna let you go.

01:03:58.579 --> 01:04:01.829
Hey, hey, what do you think about that?

01:04:08.372 --> 01:04:11.372
- This one doesn't look quite right.

01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:38.493
- Goddammit, the flies
are starting to breed

01:04:38.493 --> 01:04:41.076
and that is gonna give me away.

01:05:09.429 --> 01:05:10.262
Dammit!

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.927
Goddammit, damn fly.

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:09.373
This is all your fault,
and you're sick behavior!

01:06:15.061 --> 01:06:18.561
These damn flies are breeding around here.

01:06:30.868 --> 01:06:32.285
Ah, I've done it.

01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:04.958
- Did you hear that?

01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:09.942
They're coming for us.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:50.194
- You're gonna
leave when I let you go,

01:07:50.194 --> 01:07:52.027
is that what you want?

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.913
You move and I'll chop your head off!

01:09:00.328 --> 01:09:01.162
Detour.

01:09:18.871 --> 01:09:22.727
- That's it, that's the car,
that's the car, that's the car!

01:09:22.727 --> 01:09:24.477
I got you, I got you.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:28.443
- Stop, stop right there.

01:09:28.443 --> 01:09:30.182
He's got a gun, he's got a fucking gun.

01:09:30.182 --> 01:09:31.423
- It's not a gun.

01:09:31.423 --> 01:09:34.622
- Get on your knees,
hands behind your head.

01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:37.872
- I just saw them, they're
in that blue Buick Skyhawk.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:38.782
- Saw who?

01:09:38.782 --> 01:09:39.933
- They're getting away officer!

01:09:39.933 --> 01:09:41.402
- I got him
he's up on the east side.

01:09:57.409 --> 01:09:59.909
- You left me back there dude.

01:10:03.562 --> 01:10:06.291
I got to sit around and nurse
the cops, while they put

01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:09.208
an APB out on you for running away.

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:20.422
Is there anything you want to say?

01:10:26.729 --> 01:10:29.312
Okay, fine it's cool, whatever.

01:10:32.838 --> 01:10:34.588
Let me just say this,

01:10:36.225 --> 01:10:37.142
I feel like

01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:40.864
I was your only friend.

01:10:52.063 --> 01:10:55.146
- Okay, kid your van's here.

01:11:00.679 --> 01:11:05.547
- Whatever it is you feel
like you got to do just do it.

01:11:05.547 --> 01:11:07.380
And keep the computer.

01:11:20.157 --> 01:11:22.574
- Bradley is that you?

01:11:24.249 --> 01:11:25.499
Please, please.

01:11:26.389 --> 01:11:27.639
Please, please.

01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:32.033
- I can't see anything what happened?

01:11:33.073 --> 01:11:35.790
- Some kind of casing, the camera was

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:39.040
damaged, she rescued it, she rescued my

01:11:40.884 --> 01:11:44.090
camera it was the reason we broke up in

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:46.859
the first place it was
because of this stupid thing.

01:11:46.859 --> 01:11:48.054
- How do you know it's them?

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.377
- I just know.

01:11:49.377 --> 01:11:53.018
- You're gonna have to
do better than that kid.

01:11:53.018 --> 01:11:54.602
- Because, the signal went dead about five

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:57.817
minutes before I saw the car take off.

01:11:57.817 --> 01:11:58.900
How do you make the connection?

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.877
- Do you have any better leads?

01:12:01.877 --> 01:12:05.738
- John is there any
information on the Buick plate?

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:06.933
- Not yet.

01:12:06.933 --> 01:12:09.346
- Detective I am asking
you to trust me on this one

01:12:09.346 --> 01:12:10.813
I don't know how to
explain it but I know she's

01:12:10.813 --> 01:12:13.600
in that car, he's taking her

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.644
somewhere and if we don't find them now

01:12:15.644 --> 01:12:18.587
they're gonna be off this
mountain in half an hour.

01:12:18.587 --> 01:12:22.100
- Okay, okay, John put the call out,

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.682
I want a car on each
end of the main highway

01:12:24.682 --> 01:12:26.746
I want two more cars to do a sweep of

01:12:26.746 --> 01:12:28.584
the lower crest, you better be right

01:12:28.584 --> 01:12:30.501
about this what's this.

01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:35.908
- Just a little
longer you jezebel.

01:12:37.157 --> 01:12:39.189
- What's this I'm seeing?

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:40.439
- I don't know.

01:12:43.719 --> 01:12:46.535
- Just a nice walk in the woods

01:12:46.535 --> 01:12:50.702
now you know the way, anybody
sees us, you're gonna wave

01:12:50.702 --> 01:12:51.535
and smile,

01:12:54.695 --> 01:12:56.195
did you hear that?

01:12:57.979 --> 01:13:01.654
- She's hiding it from him, yes Gwen.

01:13:01.654 --> 01:13:04.571
- John, John, pull over, pull over.

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:10.272
What?

01:13:10.272 --> 01:13:12.355
What is that, what is it?

01:13:14.199 --> 01:13:18.366
- I thought I heard
something, keep moving.

01:13:20.085 --> 01:13:22.085
- Kill the engine, John.

01:13:27.891 --> 01:13:30.017
- I can't run through her please.

01:13:30.017 --> 01:13:33.692
- Shh, we're not far
enough away from the road yet.

01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:34.525
- What?

01:13:35.394 --> 01:13:36.811
What do you hear?

01:13:37.762 --> 01:13:38.595
- Nothing.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:41.364
- Water.

01:13:41.364 --> 01:13:42.197
- Water?

01:13:47.734 --> 01:13:51.401
- Waterfall, head to
the waterfall now John!

01:13:56.727 --> 01:13:59.644
Back to the place he left his mess.

01:14:02.924 --> 01:14:04.978
- What do yo mean by that?

01:14:04.978 --> 01:14:05.811
- Nothing.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.185
- What are you not telling me?

01:14:09.185 --> 01:14:11.136
Detective Morales?

01:14:11.136 --> 01:14:13.656
- We found three bodies
buried for about 50 yards from

01:14:13.656 --> 01:14:15.617
the waterfall, listen I was just waiting

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.617
to tell you till we ID'd the bodies.

01:14:32.948 --> 01:14:34.499
John stay with the kid.

01:14:34.499 --> 01:14:35.544
- What?

01:14:35.544 --> 01:14:36.595
No, I'm not staying here.

01:14:36.595 --> 01:14:38.578
- You're staying here
till we secure the area.

01:14:38.578 --> 01:14:41.328
- You heard him, stay put.

01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:47.572
- Keep moving,
what's that in your hand?

01:14:47.572 --> 01:14:48.905
Let me see that!

01:15:19.991 --> 01:15:21.158
Is that a fly?

01:15:24.697 --> 01:15:27.030
That's, some kind of camera.

01:15:33.777 --> 01:15:35.041
- Excuse me sir, I've really got to take a

01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:37.050
leak do you mind if, I've been holding

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:38.824
this for like two hours.

01:15:38.824 --> 01:15:40.390
- You mean this thing has been

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.557
filming us the whole time?

01:15:45.957 --> 01:15:48.219
For everyone to see?

01:15:48.219 --> 01:15:51.469
- Do it over there, hurry it up.

01:15:53.855 --> 01:15:55.272
Leave the device.

01:15:57.148 --> 01:15:59.509
- Do you mind if I just leave
it on the roof it's been

01:15:59.509 --> 01:16:03.509
running a little hot, I
just need it to air out.

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:26.281
- This is fantastic,

01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:34.652
but I'm gonna have to kill you,

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:48.475
if I could have only
seen what you have seen.

01:17:21.676 --> 01:17:25.843
- Hey be careful
there's a mess up here.

01:18:40.756 --> 01:18:42.423
- You fucking bully.

01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:53.317
- Freeze, freeze, put
it down, put the rock down,

01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:55.999
do it now!

01:19:02.968 --> 01:19:05.385
- Stop! Bradley, stop!

01:19:21.269 --> 01:19:23.583
- Come on, come on.

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:25.583
- Laura, Laura!

01:19:51.706 --> 01:19:55.873
- Go, go, go,
everything's gonna be okay.

01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:09.409
South, south west.

01:20:18.341 --> 01:20:19.805
- Hey buddy, just wanted to
send you one last message

01:20:19.805 --> 01:20:22.415
before we touchdown,
hopefully your mom saves

01:20:22.415 --> 01:20:25.222
this till after your track meet.

01:20:25.222 --> 01:20:27.444
I know you're gonna win today,

01:20:27.444 --> 01:20:30.111
I think the 440s your best race.

01:20:33.221 --> 01:20:35.467
I miss you Bradley.

01:20:35.467 --> 01:20:37.634
You're my son, I love you.

01:20:44.259 --> 01:20:48.426

another chance to talk to you,

01:20:50.038 --> 01:20:54.205
I just want you to know,
you'll always be with me.

01:20:55.204 --> 01:20:58.371
And hopefully I'll always be with you.

01:21:03.445 --> 01:21:07.220

01:21:12.492 --> 01:21:13.659
