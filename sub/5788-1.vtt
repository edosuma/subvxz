00:29.895 --> 00:33.963
What would you do if you ever
lost me?

00:33.965 --> 00:37.533
I would come find you.

00:37.535 --> 00:40.002
What if it wasn't possible?

00:40.004 --> 00:42.671
Everything is possible.

00:46.842 --> 00:49.209
Promise me you'll always come
find me.

00:52.112 --> 00:54.079
I promise.

00:54.980 --> 00:57.581
I want to stay with you here
forever.

00:59.850 --> 01:01.550
I love you.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.193
River did you hear me?

01:23.733 --> 01:25.065
Hello!

01:27.068 --> 01:28.868
You in there, asshole?

01:36.808 --> 01:38.875
Hello!

01:39.711 --> 01:42.111
Open the fucking door!

02:06.799 --> 02:09.533
The devils are here...

02:09.536 --> 02:12.236
Hell is empty... The devils are
here.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.017
Hard to read.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.657
The end is blurry.

06:21.095 --> 06:23.395
Jordana, we have to go.

06:46.751 --> 06:48.151
Guys?

06:48.318 --> 06:51.219
Ivy? Wulfric?

07:19.112 --> 07:22.380
River, I've gotta get to work.

07:22.382 --> 07:27.485
Forget my job? No,
I can't forget my job.

07:27.487 --> 07:31.288
Not all of us are going to
be famous actors one day.

07:31.290 --> 07:33.223
Someday, the two
of us are going to...

07:33.225 --> 07:35.892
live on a little country ranch
in Montana...

07:39.529 --> 07:41.062
Just the two of us?

07:41.064 --> 07:43.463
Just the two of us.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.533
I like that.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.201
I like you.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.974
Alright, I gotta go.

07:56.575 --> 07:58.242
Don't forget, we have drinks
tonight...

07:58.244 --> 08:01.411
with your two favorite people,
Pete and Jenn...

08:01.413 --> 08:03.346
River did you hear me?

08:03.348 --> 08:04.847
Don't forget, we have drinks
tonight...

08:04.849 --> 08:07.249
with your two favorite people,
Pete and Jenn...

08:07.251 --> 08:08.451
River, did you hear me?

08:08.452 --> 08:09.951
Don't forget, we have drinks
tonight...

08:09.953 --> 08:12.385
with your two favorite people,
Pete and Jenn...

08:14.154 --> 08:15.287
Did you hear me?

08:23.327 --> 08:24.960
River, did you hear me!?

08:42.845 --> 08:46.247
So, how'd you find the place?

08:46.249 --> 08:48.882
I saw the sign on the front
lawn.

08:48.884 --> 08:51.484
I figured as much, smartass.

08:51.486 --> 08:53.218
How'd you really find the place?

08:55.387 --> 08:58.288
I guess it kinda found me.

09:00.324 --> 09:02.124
It tends to draw people in.

10:58.072 --> 10:59.472
Can I help you?

11:01.074 --> 11:03.375
I'm here to see the room that's
available.

11:07.512 --> 11:08.612
Really?

11:24.395 --> 11:25.294
Promise me...

11:25.296 --> 11:27.056
you'll always come find me...

11:29.065 --> 11:31.266
I usually have someone to show
the house, but...

11:31.268 --> 11:32.767
I guess I can let you in.

11:32.769 --> 11:33.667
I'm the one that's going to
be...

11:33.669 --> 11:35.835
making the final decisions
anyway.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.171
You're not some psycho, right?

11:40.773 --> 11:45.008
Like, circling the neighborhood
to try to find your next victim?

11:45.010 --> 11:47.143
I'm just looking for a room.

12:06.761 --> 12:10.196
What are you going to do with me
when you become famous?

12:10.198 --> 12:12.198
I'm gonna leave you.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.466
Don't say that.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.501
You can be one of my fans.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.173
I'll be your biggest fan.

12:25.410 --> 12:28.880
OK. Now we gotta go. Yeah.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.481
I'm not going out.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.983
I've got to practice my
monologue.

12:34.151 --> 12:36.252
But it's already good.

12:36.254 --> 12:38.620
It has to be perfect.

12:40.923 --> 12:43.457
Where do you come up with
this preachy stuff?

12:43.459 --> 12:46.159
It... It makes you sound
psychotic!

12:47.695 --> 12:50.729
You know I hate that word.

12:50.731 --> 12:52.464
I know you hate that word.

12:52.466 --> 12:55.633
It's just... it sounds a little
psycho when you talk.

12:55.635 --> 12:57.368
You know why I HATE that word!

12:57.370 --> 12:58.702
I know, because Jordana...

12:58.704 --> 13:02.405
DON'T YOU DARE FUCKIN' MENTION
HER NAME!

13:03.907 --> 13:07.042
Why do you always freak out
every time I mention her name?

13:10.946 --> 13:14.447
I'm not trying to upset you,
River, I just...

13:15.450 --> 13:18.751
How are we supposed to get
to know each other better...

13:18.753 --> 13:20.853
when...

13:20.855 --> 13:23.322
I don't know anything
about you.

13:24.792 --> 13:30.361
I just... I'm sorry. Look, I
didn't mean to upset you.

13:32.731 --> 13:35.799
I just want to know more about
you.

13:39.970 --> 13:41.837
We've really got to go.

13:41.839 --> 13:44.639
You know I don't fucking drink!

13:44.641 --> 13:48.542
I have no desire to hang out
with your low-life friends!

13:48.544 --> 13:51.378
They're losers, dead beats,
coke-heads...

13:51.380 --> 13:54.446
living off their parents' money,
getting fucked up every night.

13:55.247 --> 13:57.881
Why would you say that?

13:57.883 --> 14:01.584
I don't say shit like that about
your friends.

14:01.586 --> 14:05.220
I don't have time for fucking
friends Brooke.

14:05.222 --> 14:07.255
I'm busy doing something with my
life...

14:07.257 --> 14:09.991
not drinking my life away.

14:09.993 --> 14:12.326
You're gonna be stuck in this
shithole...

14:12.328 --> 14:13.927
for the rest of your life!

14:15.928 --> 14:17.828
Fuck you!

14:30.273 --> 14:31.573
Wulfric.

14:31.575 --> 14:32.740
River.

14:32.742 --> 14:35.576
As you can see, we like to keep
things simple around here.

14:52.927 --> 14:57.029
This is my favorite room in the
entire house.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.531
Creepy.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.032
How so?

15:02.034 --> 15:04.334
Living in a house with things
that are dead.

15:04.702 --> 15:06.903
Nothing truly ever dies.

15:10.407 --> 15:11.840
Where are you going?

15:15.878 --> 15:20.581
I'm moving to LA, Brooke. I'm
leaving today.

15:20.583 --> 15:25.718
LA? What about Montana?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.785
What about Montana?

15:30.488 --> 15:31.821
A ranch...

15:31.823 --> 15:36.892
Just the two of us.
Maybe... kids, and a wedding.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.495
Kids? You think that I want
fucking kids?

15:40.497 --> 15:43.631
One fuckin' kid would
ultimately end my life.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.432
I would have to give up
everything.

15:45.434 --> 15:50.502
My goals, my dreams. I'm not
ready for that.

15:52.571 --> 15:54.805
And clearly neither are you.

15:57.441 --> 16:00.743
This. This thing we've got going
on...

16:00.745 --> 16:03.779
that you like to call a
relationship.

16:03.781 --> 16:07.582
It's fizzled out, run out of
steam.

16:07.584 --> 16:09.750
Not worth fighting for anymore.

16:13.354 --> 16:14.487
You don't mean that!

16:14.489 --> 16:16.521
Yes I do!

16:19.057 --> 16:20.490
I want to go with you!

16:20.492 --> 16:21.657
Don't you fucking get it?

16:21.659 --> 16:23.692
But I love you!

16:27.896 --> 16:30.831
I never fucking loved you.

16:34.902 --> 16:36.602
It's over, Brooke.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.903
What?

16:39.672 --> 16:41.606
Why?

17:03.827 --> 17:07.429
So. How'd you find the place?

17:07.596 --> 17:09.516
Promise me you'll always come
find me.

17:10.798 --> 17:12.665
I promise.

17:18.737 --> 17:19.737
Who's artwork is this?

17:19.739 --> 17:21.438
Well, mine, of course.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.507
No, I'm lying.

17:25.474 --> 17:27.008
Look, if you're not interested,
just tell me know...

17:27.010 --> 17:28.010
and stop wasting my time.

17:28.011 --> 17:30.044
No no no, I'm interested.

17:31.012 --> 17:32.912
All right then.

17:32.914 --> 17:34.946
You have a job, right?

17:37.616 --> 17:39.817
Unemployed and a smartass.

17:39.819 --> 17:41.552
You really are a catch.

17:41.554 --> 17:43.687
Ivy's going to love you.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.221
Ivy?

17:47.123 --> 17:49.891
- You go see if she's in there.
- I'll catch up to you.

18:30.833 --> 18:34.000
Get out of my house before I
phone the authorities!

18:36.837 --> 18:39.538
Shhhhh.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.274
Darling it's me.

18:44.909 --> 18:47.176
I am just showing a new friend
here the room.

18:49.812 --> 18:52.680
Sorry, I thought you were a
thief or something.

18:52.682 --> 18:54.281
I'm River.

18:55.216 --> 18:58.218
Ivy. Ivy Valeska.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.253
What a beautiful name.

19:07.894 --> 19:12.063
Sorry, I thought you were a
thief or something.

19:22.038 --> 19:26.841
It's catchy isn't it? I thought
of it myself.

19:26.843 --> 19:28.809
Stage names...

19:28.811 --> 19:30.577
Stage names?

19:30.579 --> 19:33.912
Everyone has a stage name in LA,
River.

19:34.847 --> 19:37.882
It tells the industry
that you're serious.

19:37.884 --> 19:41.818
With giant capital letters.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.519
We're actors River.

19:43.521 --> 19:44.853
I thought you were a painter?

19:44.855 --> 19:47.589
I'm an artist, in all aspects.

19:47.591 --> 19:49.691
I'm an actor too.

19:49.693 --> 19:54.195
- We're obsessed with 20s cinema.
- Aren't we baby?

19:54.197 --> 19:56.697
We kind of have to be.

19:56.699 --> 19:57.898
Film History River.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.999
You have to learn from the
greats...

19:59.001 --> 20:01.201
if you're ever going to be one.

20:01.203 --> 20:04.103
Would I have seen you in
anything?

20:04.105 --> 20:08.573
I've been acting since I was a
child, mostly foreign films.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.108
Films that most likely you
haven't seen...

20:11.110 --> 20:13.344
you being American.

20:14.612 --> 20:17.280
Wulfric and I met on set.

20:17.282 --> 20:22.151
Isn't it funny how that always
happens? Set romances.

20:22.153 --> 20:25.921
Ours turned out not to be just a
set romance.

20:34.396 --> 20:37.030
Right. Let me show you the room.

20:37.032 --> 20:39.165
It was nice meeting you River.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.066
You too.

20:43.803 --> 20:46.437
He's perfect.

21:01.085 --> 21:04.854
What's with the birds at night
here? Its kind of eerie.

21:04.856 --> 21:09.124
Morning glories. You'll get used
to them.

21:11.293 --> 21:15.229
What happened to the guy who
used to live here?

21:15.231 --> 21:19.032
He disappeared. Took off one
day without so much as a word.

21:19.034 --> 21:20.366
And what if he comes back?

21:20.368 --> 21:23.969
He won't. Trust me.

21:27.006 --> 21:29.140
What's that?

21:29.142 --> 21:31.775
That is the Leaf building.

21:31.777 --> 21:34.077
Leaf building?

21:34.079 --> 21:37.947
Influential casting companies in
business.

21:37.949 --> 21:40.382
Leaf Casting... Liz Leaf is
casting...

21:40.384 --> 21:42.450
the new Windsor Drive film.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.222
I didn't realize they were
making another one.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.958
The first one was
so... devastating.

21:51.960 --> 21:55.795
Several times. It's one of my
favorites.

21:55.797 --> 21:57.129
Not too many people have. I'm
surprised that you...

21:57.131 --> 21:59.431
That's because you don't know
me.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.832
So do you want the room or not?

22:04.101 --> 22:05.901
How much did you say the rent
was?

22:05.903 --> 22:08.003
Eleven hundred.

22:09.138 --> 22:11.372
When can I move in?

23:30.282 --> 23:32.016
Jordana!?

23:43.794 --> 23:45.194
Jordana!?

24:06.281 --> 24:08.115
Full house.

24:09.550 --> 24:12.818
Such rough hands for someone so
young.

24:12.820 --> 24:14.919
That's because they've
been through a lot.

24:16.888 --> 24:18.888
We'll let the past be the past.

24:21.524 --> 24:23.224
To new experiences.

25:06.567 --> 25:11.470
Now accepting submissions from
agency represented actors only.

25:11.472 --> 25:14.639
No unsolicited submissions.

25:26.384 --> 25:28.304
What the hell did I tell you,
asshole?

26:26.342 --> 26:28.543
I didn't know you were a morning
person.

26:33.415 --> 26:35.115
I'm here to see Liz Leaf.

26:35.349 --> 26:38.117
I wasn't notified of any casting
today.

26:38.119 --> 26:39.518
Let me see your ID.

26:51.997 --> 26:56.466
This is Randy. I have a River
Miller here to see Liz.

26:58.268 --> 27:01.303
I don't have a River Miller on
the list.

27:01.305 --> 27:02.737
Copy.

27:02.739 --> 27:05.473
Sorry buddy. You're not in the
system.

27:05.475 --> 27:07.174
You're an actor?

27:07.308 --> 27:08.474
Agent.

27:08.476 --> 27:10.709
I'm here to drop off materials
for Liz.

27:10.976 --> 27:12.209
Why don't you do me a favor,
huh, Randy?

27:12.211 --> 27:13.276
Why don't you give this to her
for me?

27:13.278 --> 27:15.544
No unsolicited packages.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.412
Why don't you get out of here.

27:17.414 --> 27:19.747
Beat it, before I call the cops.

27:27.321 --> 27:30.389
There's a guy dressed in blue
from head to toe.

27:30.391 --> 27:33.492
Asking for Liz. Just a heads up.

27:40.465 --> 27:43.666
Didn't know you were a morning
person.

27:45.235 --> 27:47.035
I didn't know anyone was up.

27:47.037 --> 27:48.636
Well now you do.

27:53.508 --> 27:54.608
Thanks.

28:04.317 --> 28:05.650
You in?

28:05.652 --> 28:08.519
I've never played dice before.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.553
Well it's time to learn.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.255
Besides, everyone plays dice
now.

28:12.257 --> 28:13.556
Ivy and I play at work for
hours.

28:13.558 --> 28:16.158
Oh yeah.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.193
Lowest number goes first.

28:22.430 --> 28:24.364
I never lose.

28:24.631 --> 28:26.264
Where do you guys work?

28:26.266 --> 28:28.432
At a bar called The Hideout down
the street.

28:28.434 --> 28:29.599
I thought you were actors.

28:29.601 --> 28:31.634
All actors work on the side,
River.

28:31.636 --> 28:33.502
Only a select few are good
enough to support themselves...

28:33.504 --> 28:35.103
solely by acting.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.920
What on earth do you keep
laughing about?

28:46.480 --> 28:48.280
Casting.

28:49.148 --> 28:51.482
Liz is actually in a casting
session right now.

28:51.484 --> 28:53.617
I'll have her give you a call
back, Jerry.

28:56.787 --> 28:58.154
Can I help you?

28:58.156 --> 29:02.625
Uh, they're in session, is there
something I can help you with?

29:02.627 --> 29:04.560
I'd like to give her something.

29:04.562 --> 29:06.261
I'll pass it on to her.

29:06.263 --> 29:09.330
I'd like to make sure she
actually gets it, personally.

29:09.332 --> 29:10.331
Well, you're gonna have to
wait...

29:10.333 --> 29:12.132
they're in session till 5
o'clock..

29:12.134 --> 29:14.200
I can wait.

29:15.368 --> 29:16.701
Have a seat.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.475
Yeah, he's here.

29:25.477 --> 29:27.210
Well now what?

29:27.212 --> 29:29.512
It's your turn to roll.

29:33.850 --> 29:36.184
Beginner's luck.

29:36.318 --> 29:37.384
Now I've got to figure out a
way...

29:37.386 --> 29:39.386
to get back in front of Liz.

29:39.388 --> 29:41.788
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.466
What the fuck?

30:46.448 --> 30:48.368
What the hell did I tell you,
asshole?

30:50.218 --> 30:52.619
Yeah I'll take two of whatever
she's having.

30:52.621 --> 30:54.721
You got it.

31:06.366 --> 31:08.266
Can I get you something buddy?

31:18.743 --> 31:19.876
Here ya go.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.794
May I sit?

31:39.629 --> 31:41.630
You want to sit with me?

32:34.782 --> 32:36.582
What are you guys doing?

32:38.885 --> 32:40.552
Join us.

34:02.900 --> 34:05.234
What are you guys doing?

34:07.437 --> 34:08.870
May I sit?

34:10.205 --> 34:11.972
You want to sit with me?

34:11.974 --> 34:13.540
Yeah. Can I?

34:13.542 --> 34:15.141
Yeah. I guess.

34:15.143 --> 34:16.809
I brought you a drink.

34:16.811 --> 34:19.043
Oh, you didn't have to do that,
I can get my own drink.

34:19.045 --> 34:20.911
I wanted to.

34:21.612 --> 34:23.013
I'm River.

34:23.781 --> 34:25.181
June.

34:25.815 --> 34:28.550
I've never noticed you here
before.

34:29.051 --> 34:31.085
That's because I'm not
noticeable.

34:31.553 --> 34:36.723
That's not true, I noticed you
the minute I walked in the door.

34:36.725 --> 34:38.991
Why are you talking to me?

34:38.993 --> 34:41.159
Because I want to.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.726
What do you want?

34:42.728 --> 34:46.697
Nothing. I just want to talk to
you.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.899
I highly doubt that.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.867
Where are you going?

34:50.869 --> 34:52.201
Home.

34:52.203 --> 34:55.771
So you can read your self-help
book at home alone?

34:55.773 --> 34:57.706
I don't need to be judged by
you.

34:57.708 --> 34:59.174
I'm not judging you, it's
just...

34:59.176 --> 35:01.876
I'm pretty sure the number one
rule of the book is...

35:01.878 --> 35:04.879
not to go home, and read it
alone.

35:04.881 --> 35:10.584
Well, aren't you observant. It
was nice meeting you River.

35:10.586 --> 35:14.654
Stay and talk to me.

35:25.799 --> 35:27.232
Join us.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.977
It's called astronomy, River.

35:39.979 --> 35:42.012
Study of celestial objects.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.147
Space and the universe.

35:44.149 --> 35:46.983
I know what astronomy is,
Wulfric.

35:46.985 --> 35:49.585
I'm just making sure.

35:51.054 --> 35:54.756
I used to love stargazing.

35:54.758 --> 35:57.225
What do you think happens to
stars when they die?

35:58.193 --> 36:00.627
They just fade away.

36:00.629 --> 36:03.529
Nothing just fades away.

36:03.531 --> 36:06.565
If anything, stars shine
brighter after death.

36:06.567 --> 36:08.800
What are you talking about.

36:08.802 --> 36:10.868
Fame is a drug you will chase
until you die.

36:10.870 --> 36:14.971
And only in death will you
become famous.

36:17.107 --> 36:19.908
Do you believe in life after
death, River?

36:19.910 --> 36:21.809
Maybe.

36:21.811 --> 36:23.811
You should.

36:23.813 --> 36:27.547
Why?

36:27.549 --> 36:28.681
Let us show you.

36:38.958 --> 36:42.026
So june, what's your story?

36:42.028 --> 36:44.628
Everyone's got one.

36:44.630 --> 36:47.197
Mine isn't that interesting.

36:47.199 --> 36:49.199
Let me be the judge of that.

36:49.934 --> 36:53.002
I moved to LA to become a
casting director.

36:53.004 --> 36:54.670
Right now, I'm junior casting...

36:54.672 --> 36:57.005
under the one and the only Liz
Leaf.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.606
Never heard of her.

36:58.608 --> 37:02.308
Well now you know my story,
I wanna know yours.

37:04.311 --> 37:06.345
I'm an actor.

37:08.114 --> 37:11.949
Of course you are. That would be
my cue to leave.

37:11.951 --> 37:13.083
What? Why?

37:14.785 --> 37:16.786
It figures you would be "an
actor".

37:16.788 --> 37:18.621
It's just my luck.

37:18.623 --> 37:20.055
And what's wrong with that?

37:20.057 --> 37:22.057
Everyone in this town is
an actor.

37:22.059 --> 37:26.327
I work with actors all day. The
last thing I want to do...

37:26.329 --> 37:29.730
is be hanging out with
one outside of work.

37:29.732 --> 37:32.065
For all I know, you just want to
hang out with me...

37:32.067 --> 37:34.666
so you can get a role in some
movie.

37:36.268 --> 37:38.335
Let's make a deal, June.

37:38.337 --> 37:39.703
For as long as we know each
other...

37:39.705 --> 37:41.838
I'll never bug you about your
work.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.139
If you never bug me about mine.

37:43.141 --> 37:45.141
For as long as we know each
other?

37:45.143 --> 37:48.844
That is a little bit
presumptuous don't you think?

37:48.846 --> 37:51.813
I'm just trying to put your
little heart at ease.

37:55.050 --> 37:57.718
It's late. I really should get
going.

37:57.953 --> 38:02.155
No, I can drive myself, thank
you.

38:02.157 --> 38:05.057
Well, can I at least get your
number or something?

38:05.059 --> 38:08.894
I don't give out my number to
actors.

38:08.896 --> 38:15.901
Well... here's mine. In case you
change your mind.

38:21.674 --> 38:25.175
It was really nice meeting you.

38:50.799 --> 38:52.032
What is it?

38:52.034 --> 38:54.067
It's Peyote.

38:54.069 --> 38:55.735
Is it safe.

38:55.737 --> 38:57.002
Of course.

39:01.807 --> 39:04.208
Go on. Trust me.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.252
Close your eyes.

39:17.053 --> 39:21.121
Now I want you to picture
someone who was close to you.

39:22.289 --> 39:25.791
Perhaps someone you'd like to
see again.

40:22.343 --> 40:25.044
You're an asshole, you fucking
piece of shit!

40:25.046 --> 40:27.212
You're an asshole, you fucking
piece of shit!

40:27.214 --> 40:28.246
I'll fucking kill you!

40:28.248 --> 40:30.281
You do that again I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

40:30.283 --> 40:32.516
Fucking psychopath!

40:32.518 --> 40:33.450
You sick prick!

40:33.452 --> 40:35.151
I'm gonna take your face...

40:35.153 --> 40:38.087
and burn you alive!

40:48.097 --> 40:50.397
MATT; Open the fucking door!

41:04.511 --> 41:06.278
Can I help you with something?

41:37.242 --> 41:40.177
Someone yelling just woke me up.

41:40.179 --> 41:41.912
Do you have any concept of how
hard it is...

41:41.914 --> 41:43.179
to get to sleep for me?

41:43.181 --> 41:45.848
I'm sorry. I had no idea someone
was next door...

41:45.850 --> 41:47.416
listening to me.

41:47.418 --> 41:50.352
Right, everybody's sorry for
something in their life.

41:50.354 --> 41:52.554
Alright? Don't be sorry.

41:52.556 --> 41:54.322
Who you yelling at?

42:24.218 --> 42:26.185
I can't do this.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.555
What do you mean we can't do
this?

42:30.557 --> 42:33.491
If he ever found out, he would
kill us.

42:33.493 --> 42:36.093
Never again.

42:36.928 --> 42:38.061
But that...

42:38.063 --> 42:39.228
It's over.

42:39.230 --> 42:41.163
Forget about us.

42:41.531 --> 42:42.964
Forget about us?

42:42.966 --> 42:44.332
But, I love you!

42:44.334 --> 42:45.566
But I love you!

42:45.568 --> 42:46.400
I love you.

42:46.402 --> 42:47.467
I love you!

42:47.469 --> 42:50.002
I love you?!? I FUCKING
LOVE YOU?!?!

42:50.004 --> 42:52.070
Do you even know what
those words mean?!?

42:52.072 --> 42:55.239
Of course I know what those
words mean.

42:55.241 --> 42:58.108
- We're fucking.
- That's not love.

42:58.110 --> 42:59.109
You don't mean that.

42:59.111 --> 42:59.876
You don't mean that!

42:59.878 --> 43:00.877
Yes I do!

43:00.879 --> 43:04.113
You can't find love in a month.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.416
That's lust you feel. I found
love once.

43:07.418 --> 43:10.219
And I know I'll probably never
find it again.

43:10.221 --> 43:12.821
So stop wasting your time on me.

43:19.995 --> 43:22.229
Everyone in this town is an
actor.

43:22.231 --> 43:24.097
Last thing I want to do is be
hanging out with one...

43:24.099 --> 43:26.265
Outside of work.

43:26.267 --> 43:28.400
And, for all I know, you just
want to hang out with me...

43:28.402 --> 43:31.102
so you can get a role in some
movie.

43:31.104 --> 43:33.504
Well, can I at least get your
number?

43:34.372 --> 43:36.439
I don't give my number out to
actors.

43:40.242 --> 43:42.343
I found love once.

43:42.345 --> 43:45.079
And I know I'll probably never
find it again.

43:45.413 --> 43:47.514
So stop wasting your time on me,

43:57.123 --> 44:00.258
That was amazing.

44:00.260 --> 44:02.793
Really, a really nice
performance.

44:02.795 --> 44:04.094
If you read like that...

44:04.096 --> 44:07.163
she would be stupid not to offer
you the role.

44:07.531 --> 44:09.732
What are you doing in here?

44:10.200 --> 44:14.535
Just reading lines for River's
audition.

44:14.537 --> 44:16.203
We're late for work.

44:55.374 --> 44:57.508
What the fuck are you doing in
here?

44:58.576 --> 45:00.643
It's a man's own mind, not his
enemy or foe...

45:00.645 --> 45:02.811
that lures him to his evil ways.

45:14.689 --> 45:15.689
Excuse me?

45:15.691 --> 45:17.624
Are Wulfric and Ivy working
tonight?

45:17.626 --> 45:18.324
What?

45:18.326 --> 45:20.225
Wulfric and Ivy?

45:20.227 --> 45:21.526
The hell is that?

45:21.528 --> 45:23.427
They work here?

45:23.429 --> 45:24.694
No they don't.

45:31.835 --> 45:33.268
Where do you guys work?

45:33.270 --> 45:35.603
At a bar called the Hideout.

45:35.605 --> 45:37.771
Surprise.

45:39.540 --> 45:40.840
Wait a minute.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.680
There you are.

45:50.314 --> 45:51.814
Didn't know if you were coming
back...

45:51.816 --> 45:54.483
after what happened the other
night.

45:54.485 --> 45:57.152
That was a real fucked up thing
of Wulfric to do.

45:57.154 --> 45:58.319
Stay away from her.

45:59.321 --> 46:00.854
River...

46:03.290 --> 46:05.958
Don't be mad at me for something
he did.

46:06.359 --> 46:11.562
I was just trying to enlighten
you...

46:11.564 --> 46:14.631
Open you up to new experiences.

46:16.433 --> 46:17.466
So I went back-So I went back-

46:17.468 --> 46:19.734
So I went back tot he Hideout
and had a drink.

46:19.736 --> 46:20.835
Oh, you did?

46:20.837 --> 46:22.336
Yeah.

46:22.637 --> 46:23.703
I asked for you and Wulfric...

46:23.705 --> 46:25.638
but no one knew who you were.

46:25.839 --> 46:27.272
You asked who?

46:27.274 --> 46:28.973
The bar-back.

46:30.208 --> 46:31.708
James...

46:31.710 --> 46:33.509
Troublemaker.

46:33.511 --> 46:37.212
Probably thought it was comedic.

46:38.414 --> 46:40.334
He didn't seem like the comedic
type.

46:42.283 --> 46:43.283
What's that?

46:43.285 --> 46:44.717
Sounded like a car.

46:51.758 --> 46:53.678
Promise me you'll always come
find me.

47:06.805 --> 47:10.807
You sick, delusional,
hypocritical slut!

47:11.475 --> 47:13.442
All this time you pretend like
you want to...

47:13.444 --> 47:17.913
When you knew me all along you
stalker bitch!

47:19.782 --> 47:21.716
Why don't you come back here...

47:21.718 --> 47:25.319
and say it to my face, you
little whore!

47:29.525 --> 47:31.358
Fuck you, River!

47:31.360 --> 47:33.460
Don't you dare fucking come
back!

47:34.895 --> 47:37.263
I never fucking loved you.

47:37.265 --> 47:39.898
Jordana, we have to go.

48:05.957 --> 48:07.657
River! Look at me, River!

48:07.659 --> 48:08.591
My meds!

48:08.593 --> 48:09.291
Your meds?

48:09.293 --> 48:10.692
In the cabinets!

48:14.396 --> 48:15.662
Here.

50:34.792 --> 50:36.092
June.

50:38.595 --> 50:40.495
Well isn't this a nice surprise.

50:43.398 --> 50:46.466
If I would've known I would've
worn something nicer.

50:47.768 --> 50:49.602
I like what you're wearing.

50:52.906 --> 50:55.741
You're reading the Confederacy
of Dunces?

50:55.743 --> 50:58.143
Yeah, I really like it so far.

50:58.644 --> 51:01.912
That is one of my all-time
favorite novels.

51:03.147 --> 51:05.213
What are you doing here?

51:06.682 --> 51:08.049
Laundry.

51:08.051 --> 51:10.718
Right. Yeah, it's a laundromat.

51:11.419 --> 51:12.852
I live down the street.

51:12.854 --> 51:14.019
So do I!

51:14.021 --> 51:15.587
Careful, you tell me where you
live...

51:15.589 --> 51:17.822
I could be some creepy
stalker...

51:17.824 --> 51:19.723
I'm... I'm not...

51:21.659 --> 51:23.526
You never called me, June.

51:23.660 --> 51:25.560
I was a little hurt.

51:26.662 --> 51:29.497
I'm sorry. I meant to, I still
am...

51:29.499 --> 51:33.400
It's just I... Liz has had me so
slammed at work and...

51:33.402 --> 51:35.902
I... she's actually still
worried about where...

51:35.904 --> 51:38.437
all her stuff is right now. So
I have to go.

51:38.439 --> 51:40.172
You're working on a Saturday?

51:40.174 --> 51:43.508
Yeah, stuff we're working on is
all due next week...

51:43.510 --> 51:44.809
so we're crammed.

51:45.610 --> 51:48.011
Top secret mission, huh?

51:48.013 --> 51:50.513
It was nice running into you
again.

51:51.481 --> 51:53.482
June...

51:53.484 --> 51:55.584
Do you want to come over for
dinner tonight?

51:55.586 --> 51:58.453
I told you how I feel about
actors.

51:58.455 --> 52:00.188
So let me change your mind.

52:00.190 --> 52:01.722
I'll cook for you.

52:05.592 --> 52:08.126
Okay. Yeah.

52:08.128 --> 52:09.193
Perfect.

52:09.195 --> 52:12.696
My place. Text me and I'll send
you the address.

52:12.698 --> 52:14.063
Alright I will.

53:39.779 --> 53:41.379
Where you at, June...

53:46.050 --> 53:48.284
Oh god...

53:48.286 --> 53:49.184
Hey you.

53:49.186 --> 53:50.385
Hey.

53:56.191 --> 53:57.758
You look great.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.459
Thank you, so do you.

54:03.063 --> 54:05.297
Why don't you let your hair
down.

54:14.339 --> 54:15.806
Wow.

54:24.248 --> 54:27.783
River, I'm not used to all this
special treatment.

54:27.785 --> 54:30.085
Well get used to it.

54:30.087 --> 54:31.786
I'll be right back.

54:40.060 --> 54:41.994
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message-

54:41.996 --> 54:43.362
Fuck, June.

54:44.364 --> 54:47.199
Answer the goddamn phone, June!

55:11.323 --> 55:14.224
Where did you learn to cook like
this?

55:15.426 --> 55:21.897
As with anything, practice makes
perfect.

55:21.899 --> 55:24.165
Thanks for giving me a chance,
June.

55:27.068 --> 55:30.336
I know I said we wouldn't talk
about work, but-

55:30.338 --> 55:32.438
Honestly, I feel that you would
be perfect for...

55:32.440 --> 55:35.306
the role that Liz is casting
right now.

55:36.808 --> 55:38.275
I don't know, June...

55:38.277 --> 55:43.313
I wouldn't wanna mess up what
we've got going on here.

55:43.315 --> 55:45.315
No, don't be silly.

55:45.317 --> 55:46.983
Tomorrow's the last day we're
casting.

55:46.985 --> 55:48.851
So you should come in.

55:50.053 --> 55:51.453
Please?

55:53.089 --> 55:54.888
Okay.

56:17.943 --> 56:20.010
Stay away from her.

56:30.988 --> 56:32.955
Promise me you'll always come
find me.

56:32.957 --> 56:35.057
River, do you hear me?

56:47.936 --> 56:52.472
So, did you try on the skirt of
little Miss Casting Director?

56:57.911 --> 56:59.211
Well?

57:01.347 --> 57:04.047
I had such a great time tonight.

57:06.216 --> 57:08.617
I don't know how to thank you.

57:19.961 --> 57:22.061
You just did.

57:24.831 --> 57:26.464
I'll see you tomorrow.

57:35.274 --> 57:39.409
I did what I had to do to get
the audition.

57:39.411 --> 57:41.477
You don't sound too excited.

57:45.381 --> 57:46.547
Hey.

57:46.549 --> 57:49.883
River, look at me.

57:49.885 --> 57:51.985
What is it? What's wrong?

57:59.493 --> 58:00.893
Whose is it?

58:00.895 --> 58:02.494
Who do you fucking think?

58:03.562 --> 58:06.163
Everything I've worked for just
went down the drain.

58:06.165 --> 58:09.166
If she keeps it, I'm gonna have
to move back to Tahoe.

58:09.168 --> 58:13.670
Don't say that. Hey. Hey! No.

58:16.473 --> 58:19.475
You have to take care of it.

58:23.446 --> 58:25.512
What the fuck is he doing over
there?

58:25.514 --> 58:27.514
He's starting to piss me off.

58:32.152 --> 58:35.320
Probably contemplating suicide.

58:36.955 --> 58:39.323
Because I'm here.

58:40.191 --> 58:44.160
Spending time with you.

58:49.966 --> 58:51.632
I'll take care of it.

58:54.035 --> 58:56.636
I'll go appease him.

59:23.928 --> 59:26.195
Liz, this is River Miller.

59:43.245 --> 59:47.013
Hey. Rough night, neighbor?

59:48.048 --> 59:49.048
Wait a minute...

59:49.050 --> 59:49.915
Aren't you...

59:49.917 --> 59:53.485
Yes you are! You're Young John
Winchester...

59:53.487 --> 59:56.453
from Supernatural! You live next
door!?

59:57.955 --> 01:00:00.056
Surprise!

01:00:00.457 --> 01:00:03.258
Do you mind actually coming in
and helping me with my lines?

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.028
That-I mean, I could use your
professional opinion.

01:00:10.165 --> 01:00:13.399
Do you have any concept-I'm
sure you don't...

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:16.435
Of how hard it is for me to get
to sleep at night?

01:00:16.437 --> 01:00:17.636
Things that go on in my mind...

01:00:17.638 --> 01:00:19.604
Thing that would play over and
over...

01:00:19.606 --> 01:00:21.172
Stuff that I have to deal with!?

01:00:21.174 --> 01:00:23.340
I'm so sorry, I didn't-I had no
idea...

01:00:23.342 --> 01:00:25.475
Someone was next door listening.

01:00:25.477 --> 01:00:28.010
I've got to meditate for two
hours in dead silence...

01:00:28.012 --> 01:00:29.277
before I go to sleep. 'Cause if
not...

01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:30.645
I'm gonna wake up in a puddle of
sweat...

01:00:30.647 --> 01:00:33.180
in a fucking anxiety attack!

01:00:33.182 --> 01:00:37.150
So could you mind just keeping
it down?

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.718
Sure thing.

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:44.222
I feel ya.

01:01:01.439 --> 01:01:03.807
We can't do this anymore.

01:01:06.343 --> 01:01:07.675
We can't do this anymore.

01:01:10.578 --> 01:01:13.046
We can't do this anymore.

01:01:22.355 --> 01:01:25.757
Do you want to go before me,
bro? I just...

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:31.161
I don't know I think it would be
a good move for me.

01:01:31.163 --> 01:01:35.397
Strategically. It's nothing
against you.

01:01:35.399 --> 01:01:37.198
If you aren't ready, that's
fine. Are you ready?

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:44.738
I mean you look... Ready? You
know I like to help people out.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.239
You know spur of the
moment stuff.

01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:48.407
Sometimes you get in there
you're not ready. You're ready.

01:01:48.409 --> 01:01:51.443
Whatever it is, it comes off
more natural.

01:01:52.278 --> 01:01:56.513
Either way, what's the big deal?
It's Liz. You know Liz, right?

01:01:56.515 --> 01:02:01.116
She's awesome. Awesome.
Sweetheart. Really.

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:02.750
She loves me.

01:02:14.796 --> 01:02:17.831
So when are call backs, baby? I
want to clear my schedule.

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:20.567
Uh, you know. It could be days
or weeks.

01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:21.868
It was good?

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.502
Good. Yeah, great.

01:02:23.504 --> 01:02:24.769
Okay, great. Bye!

01:02:24.771 --> 01:02:28.239
Bye. Matt?

01:02:28.241 --> 01:02:29.907
Hey, Jamie!

01:02:35.146 --> 01:02:38.214
Oh my god, River. Are you okay?

01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:43.452
What happened to you after I
left?

01:02:43.454 --> 01:02:45.287
I had a rough night.

01:02:48.457 --> 01:02:49.890
I feel like you should have
stitches or something.

01:02:49.892 --> 01:02:51.625
I'm okay. It's fine.

01:02:51.627 --> 01:02:52.726
You sure?

01:02:55.796 --> 01:02:59.265
JUNE!

01:02:59.267 --> 01:03:05.204
Casting sessions over, buddy. I
nailed it. Come on, smile.

01:03:05.206 --> 01:03:08.173
It looks better on you.

01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.707
I can try and get you a later
call time.

01:03:09.709 --> 01:03:11.508
Really, it's not a big deal.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.644
I'm in character.

01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:16.846
Okay

01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:33.929
Liz, this is River Miller.

01:03:43.705 --> 01:03:50.677
Let's see. Short. Short. Some
feature no one's ever heard of.

01:03:50.679 --> 01:03:56.248
Another short. Wow. Such an
impressive resume.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:04:00.652
Who represents you again? It's
not like that matters.

01:04:00.654 --> 01:04:05.389
I don't have time for this.
Let's get started. Scene 1.

01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:06.656
Do you want me to slate?

01:04:06.658 --> 01:04:12.761
What do you think? Hurry.

01:04:12.763 --> 01:04:16.397
I'm River Miller, and I'm here
to read for the role of Cain.

01:04:23.003 --> 01:04:24.503
We can't do this?

01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:26.905
What do you mean we can't do
this?

01:04:26.907 --> 01:04:29.774
If he ever found out, he would
kill us.

01:04:29.776 --> 01:04:31.008
But that would mean...

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.910
It's over! Forget about us!

01:04:35.646 --> 01:04:38.014
That's enough.

01:04:38.016 --> 01:04:40.783
What? We didn't even... We didn't
even finish the scene.

01:04:40.785 --> 01:04:42.684
Yes. Yes, we have.

01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:49.756
Why couldn't you just let him
finish?

01:04:49.758 --> 01:04:50.957
That's all I needed to see.

01:04:50.959 --> 01:04:53.459
He was amazing. You didn't give
him a chance.

01:04:53.461 --> 01:04:55.294
I've been in this business for
years.

01:04:55.296 --> 01:04:57.763
I know what I'm talking about.

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:38.466
Hey.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:42.803
Did you miss me?

01:05:45.439 --> 01:05:48.941
Oh yes, you did.

01:05:48.943 --> 01:05:51.409
You said I couldn't find you.

01:05:53.678 --> 01:05:59.749
You thought you could get rid of
me that easily, didn't you?

01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:01.917
Awww.

01:06:09.724 --> 01:06:11.558
You thought we were done.

01:06:16.429 --> 01:06:19.964
We will never...

01:06:19.966 --> 01:06:21.632
Be done.

01:06:48.524 --> 01:06:54.628
I'm going to name her Jordana.

01:06:54.630 --> 01:07:00.033
Oh you poor thing. You didn't
know?

01:07:09.576 --> 01:07:10.120
Shhhh...

01:07:15.649 --> 01:07:21.719
Now, if I untie those, are you
going to be a good boy?

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:33.696
Okay. Shhhh...

01:07:40.703 --> 01:07:43.103
You think I want fucking kids?

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.608
One fucking kid would
ultimately end my life.

01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:13.062
STOP! NO!

01:09:11.019 --> 01:09:13.519
The devils are here...

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.188
Hell is empty... The devils are
here.

01:09:57.624 --> 01:09:59.625
Stay with me.

01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:09.966
Why?! Why?! Why JORDANA?!

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:14.003
Jordana, please! Please Jordana!

01:10:29.919 --> 01:10:33.354
Promise me, you'll always come
find me.

01:10:37.225 --> 01:10:38.892
I love you.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.960
River, did you hear me?

01:10:44.164 --> 01:10:46.365
I want to stay with you here
forever.

01:10:55.941 --> 01:10:59.109
I'm going to name her Jordana?

01:11:19.795 --> 01:11:20.295
River?

01:11:43.251 --> 01:11:46.252
I'm glad you took care of it.

01:11:47.787 --> 01:11:49.821
It's for the best, trust me.

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:52.222
You'll find her in the darkness.

01:12:11.374 --> 01:12:15.942
- There's no such thing as death.
- There's no such thing as death.

01:12:15.944 --> 01:12:20.913
There's no such thing as death.
There's no such thing as death.

01:12:20.915 --> 01:12:24.650
There's no such thing as death.

01:12:24.652 --> 01:12:26.151
There's no such thing as death.

01:12:26.153 --> 01:12:30.954
There's no such thing as death.
There's no such thing as death.

01:12:30.956 --> 01:12:35.991
There's no such thing as death.
There's no such thing as death.

01:12:35.993 --> 01:12:40.294
There's no such thing as death.
There's no such thing as death.

01:12:40.296 --> 01:12:42.929
There's no su...

01:12:50.904 --> 01:12:52.404
River?

01:13:07.086 --> 01:13:08.452
Oh my god...

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.114
So nice to finally meet you,
Brooke.

01:14:12.116 --> 01:14:13.876
We've heard so much about you.

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:24.858
All good things I hope.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.394
No, actually. Terrible things.

01:15:03.127 --> 01:15:05.261
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.480
You already killed her.

01:15:29.116 --> 01:15:30.416
Don't you remember?

01:16:11.724 --> 01:16:13.691
I love you!

01:16:14.459 --> 01:16:17.127
I love you!

01:16:45.019 --> 01:16:48.788
My name is River Miller. I am 27
years old.

01:16:56.596 --> 01:16:58.697
I have no problem getting my
hands a little dirty...

01:16:58.699 --> 01:17:01.199
To ensure that things are done
right.

01:17:20.652 --> 01:17:23.020
Some might find it a little off.

01:17:24.423 --> 01:17:26.289
River?

01:17:26.291 --> 01:17:28.357
Strange perhaps...

01:17:31.694 --> 01:17:34.228
but there is a method to the
madness...

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.602
There are only 2 relevant human
emotions...

01:17:44.671 --> 01:17:46.672
Love...

01:17:46.674 --> 01:17:48.140
and Fear...

01:17:55.681 --> 01:17:59.717
What would you do if you ever
lost me?

01:17:59.719 --> 01:18:04.188
All others are meaningless.

01:18:05.305 --> 01:18:11.521
