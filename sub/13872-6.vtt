00:06.473 --> 00:09.306
Are you totally sure about this one?

00:09.376 --> 00:13.779
It says to do it, Steve, and I wrote it.
So it must be right!

00:13.847 --> 00:15.212
Okay, well...

00:19.552 --> 00:23.716
"Now wait for further instructions
from talking hole in neck".

00:25.558 --> 00:26.547
Screw that.

01:09.369 --> 01:12.532
Hey, y'all know what would be fun?

01:13.173 --> 01:16.609
- If I get in that pool.
- And how long has it been since lunch?

01:18.645 --> 01:19.703
Six seconds.

01:19.779 --> 01:23.681
- I just saw you eat 40 hot dogs, didn't I?
- Forty? No.

01:24.551 --> 01:27.645
- Forty-eight.
- You have to wait 20 minutes, Meatwad.

01:27.720 --> 01:31.884
We'll let him in and watch him cramp up,
get sucked into the filter and jam it all up.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.791
- Shake, shut the hell up.
- Why don't you make...

01:35.261 --> 01:37.126
Why don't I make what?

01:37.430 --> 01:40.888
I said, make what? You still trying
to think of what you want me to make?

01:40.967 --> 01:43.697
'Cause I'll make it. Are you all right?

01:46.039 --> 01:48.564
Japanese? When did you start
speaking Japanese?

01:53.379 --> 01:55.813
- Since when did you get a tail?
- A tail?

01:55.882 --> 01:59.010
Yeah. Dragons have tails,
and kitty cats and lizards...

01:59.085 --> 02:01.952
- Could you please shut up?
- I got a lot to say.

02:02.021 --> 02:04.683
- Who the hell are you?
- Yeah, get a load of that.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.227
No, no. Get off me, Shake.
I mean, who are you?

02:14.400 --> 02:17.631
So he's using Shake as his vessel
to communicate with us.

02:17.704 --> 02:21.196
Hell, I figured that out.
He done got 90 eyes and no mouth.

02:21.274 --> 02:23.265
Where else he gonna talk?
Through his butt?

02:23.343 --> 02:27.211
He won't have a butt. Most aliens
recycle their own wastes for fuel.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.516
Obviously, this one doesn't.

02:53.973 --> 02:55.065
What did he say?

02:55.141 --> 02:59.771
My Japanese is a bit rusty, but there was
clearly something stated about fish drama.

03:02.215 --> 03:05.150
That's odd. Apparently the fish
are slanted and require beards.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.685
Must be some sort of a religious...

03:08.721 --> 03:11.713
Now I understand.
It's a marriage proposal.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.454
Let me handle this. Listen, we've
been through some good times together...

03:15.528 --> 03:18.929
and I will always cherish that,
but we do not want to marry you.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.330
We still want to date around
and see other people.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.528
Meatwad, please.
He's not gonna understand that.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.577
He agrees! Or he disagrees.

03:35.648 --> 03:38.446
Oh, my God, my head. Who are you?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.850
Back away from her. She's psycho.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.718
Unless you're ready to settle down
and have some young'uns.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.782
I can't commit to that.
I'm young, I'm hip, and I'm single.

03:46.859 --> 03:50.090
I'm a tiger out there.
You don't put a leash on a tiger.

03:50.163 --> 03:53.189
Plus, that's not female.
Look at it, no boobies.

03:53.266 --> 03:56.360
- Shut up. He's trying to say something.
- Yeah, he's trying to say:

03:56.436 --> 04:00.202
"I need somebody to kick me in the ass
so I can get the hell off your land".

04:00.273 --> 04:02.605
That's what you're trying to say, right?

04:02.675 --> 04:05.940
Thank you. I'm sorry.
What I mean to say is...

04:09.082 --> 04:12.142
<i>Yesterday was a good day for a birthday.</i>

04:12.218 --> 04:15.278
Yesterday good day birthday.

04:15.355 --> 04:19.257
I'm impressed. He seems to be
picking this English up pretty fast.

04:19.325 --> 04:23.989
I mean, it took me forever,
and me still don't does it right, do me?

04:24.063 --> 04:27.032
Yeah, I just wish there was
a better way for him to talk...

04:27.100 --> 04:30.035
without just, you know,
puncturing someone's skull.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.369
Yeah, I tell you what. He tries that
at the roller rink, he ain't gonna cut it.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.908
I got an infection from them rental skates.

04:36.976 --> 04:40.241
That's why I don't
skate backwards anymore. It hurts.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.441
You are interested in this?

04:42.515 --> 04:44.983
<i>- Don't be such a bitch.
- I'm a lawyer.</i>

04:45.051 --> 04:48.509
Don't be such a bitch. I lawyer.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.816
Get him to say:

04:49.889 --> 04:54.792
"Meatwad's number one. I'm afraid of him
because I'm poopy pants. Eat my doodoo".

04:55.428 --> 04:58.158
I don't eat doodoo,
but make it like he does.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.029
<i>Why don't you come up to my room
for a drink?</i>

05:01.100 --> 05:03.330
<i>- Hey, boy, listen to me.
- I'll be nude.</i>

05:03.403 --> 05:06.566
Come up to room for drink. Nude be me.

05:06.639 --> 05:10.575
- So, how are your lessons going?
- Shut up, bitch. Get beer for me lawyer.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.271
- What? What did you just say to me?
- I need 401!

05:13.346 --> 05:16.679
I think I know what you need.
You're going into a time-out!

05:16.749 --> 05:19.240
Please. Me so sorry.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.516
You look good in dress.
You look better on my floor.

05:22.588 --> 05:23.850
Who got these language tapes?

05:23.923 --> 05:25.550
- You bitch!
- That's all Carl had.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.389
"Do it all night, every night"?
This is a self-help seminar!

05:28.461 --> 05:31.555
- Please to frame us. That's all right.
- Get in that room!

05:31.631 --> 05:35.590
- Me knew that...
- No, by yourself! This is my good friend.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.699
Oh, God, what happened?

05:37.770 --> 05:39.897
You blacked out. It's nothing.
Go back to sleep.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.702
- Why you sending him to my room?
- It's just for a few days.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.539
It's always,
"Just for a few days, Meatwad".

05:45.611 --> 05:47.602
Do you understand
how long a space that is?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.706
-782 hours.
- Neither do I.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.616
- I want to enjoy my room while I'm alive.
- Yeah, that's nice.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.450
I could have been the roller skate king
down here on Earth.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.989
- You know what I'm saying?
- No.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.649
You don't? 'Cause I don't.

05:59.726 --> 06:03.355
How come there was just morning,
and now it's, like, nighttime now?

06:03.429 --> 06:06.057
Because you got yourself infected
by an alien s'more.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.121
I got the what?

06:07.200 --> 06:11.637
No, you didn't. You know Meatwad.
He's full of stories. And it's a spore.

06:11.904 --> 06:16.864
You know what? Some crazy nut-job broad
must've slipped me one of the date drugs.

06:17.243 --> 06:20.770
- Must have been.
- Gotten me loaded, had her way with me.

06:21.047 --> 06:25.279
That's the problem. I'm too attractive
to women. I know it makes you mad.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.912
- Yes, it does.
- Listen, it's nothing for us to fight about.

06:28.988 --> 06:32.287
- It's all good in the hood, you know?
- I know. I know, it's cool.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.451
You'll get your own girl one day.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.223
Fat chick! Excuse me,
a little something in my throat.

06:37.296 --> 06:40.094
<i>I ain't never seen nothing like this, baby.</i>

06:44.771 --> 06:47.365
Good morning, everybody.
I just got a little...

06:47.440 --> 06:49.408
What are you doing here?

06:49.742 --> 06:52.336
Did I not tell you yesterday
that I didn't want...

06:52.412 --> 06:54.710
Actually, it was about two weeks ago.

06:55.314 --> 06:59.307
Yeah. Whatever I did,
whenever I did it, it stands.

06:59.819 --> 07:03.755
Let me straighten you out here, sponge.
It's give and take around here.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.314
- You give it to me, and I'll take it.
- Okay, go ahead.

07:06.392 --> 07:09.054
And you ain't doing much for me, so I'm...

07:09.128 --> 07:12.689
All right, now show me
which utensil you use to eat this.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.693
He eats just like an insect.

07:16.569 --> 07:19.265
And I thought he was doing it
because he thinks it's cool.

07:19.338 --> 07:23.604
- You like that, bitch?
- It is cool. It is cool.

07:23.676 --> 07:26.736
- You my bitch!
- Rude! Are you doing this just to spite me?

07:26.813 --> 07:29.111
I try better next time.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.618
Please, more flapjack now.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.516
- That's better.
- I rule you.

07:34.587 --> 07:38.182
- Frylock, he says he rules us.
- That's it, mister! Time-out for you.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.418
- Damn!
- What did I just hear you say?

07:40.493 --> 07:42.927
I heard him. He said "damn," damn it.

07:42.995 --> 07:47.989
Only adults like us are allowed
to say damn, bitch, ass, and hell.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.633
So get your hellin', damnin' ass...

07:50.703 --> 07:53.866
back in that bitchin' damn room, damn it.

07:56.075 --> 07:59.044
What? Damn!
I was just helping you out, bitch!

07:59.111 --> 08:03.605
You shouldn't mouth off like that.
If you didn't say nothing, we'd be free.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.010
- Frylock!
- I said time-out! That means no talking!

08:08.087 --> 08:11.284
How are you doing?
I think I need to go to the doctor...

08:11.357 --> 08:15.691
because I've been losing
long, long tracks of time now.

08:16.195 --> 08:21.189
I'm starting to just get a little freaked out
about the fact that my hand is missing!

08:22.401 --> 08:23.425
I can't find it.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.438
You'll be fine. That hole
in your head will heal up in no time.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.098
A hole? That's great.

08:28.441 --> 08:32.275
I'm sure it was drilled
on one of those days I can't remember.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.245
No, no. It's more like a dimple, really.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.476
I mean, it makes you look cute, really,
like Shirley Temple.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.914
I don't remember Bojangles...

08:38.985 --> 08:42.477
holding her brain in the back of her head
as they tap-danced together.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.422
Your communication portal
is pretty bruised up in there.

08:45.791 --> 08:49.090
You can see in there?
That's fun! First off...

08:49.161 --> 08:53.029
I might not remember the last two weeks,
but I know I don't have a portal.

08:53.099 --> 08:57.399
Look, it doesn't matter what did
or didn't happen. The point is, I made this.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.835
What is that? For vegetables?

08:58.905 --> 09:01.669
It translates brain synapses
and neural skull vibrations...

09:01.741 --> 09:03.208
into audible speech frequencies.

09:03.276 --> 09:06.575
Yeah, I got one of them, too.
It's called a mouth. What's your point?

09:06.646 --> 09:09.012
Look, here's $5. Go see a movie.

09:10.583 --> 09:14.110
- Motion pictures are $10.
- Fine, here's $10.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.888
- What about popcorn?
- Whatever! Damn, just go!

09:20.393 --> 09:22.327
- I wonder what's playing.
- Go!

09:22.395 --> 09:24.386
Fine! I know when to go.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.359
- Do you know what...
- Go!

09:30.670 --> 09:34.572
- Is that what I think it is?
- It's an N.S.T., a neural speech transmitter.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.304
No. It's my B.N.C.S.
My "brushed-nickel colander, stupid".

09:39.378 --> 09:42.870
Take them wires off there and give it back.
I need to drain my spaghetti.

09:42.949 --> 09:46.214
- You don't cook. You sleep in this thing.
- Shut up. You got fetishes.

09:46.285 --> 09:50.551
I think he's got something to say with
his new helmet. Come on, you can do it.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.848
Just try. Come on.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.294
- How you doing?
- That's pretty much a dry hole.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.920
Go on, use the helmet.

09:59.365 --> 10:00.923
<i>Hello?</i>

10:01.734 --> 10:04.498
<i>Hello. Hello, Cleveland!</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:07.296
<i>Joke!</i>

10:07.373 --> 10:09.170
<i>- It works! Yes!
- Yes!</i>

10:10.843 --> 10:15.303
<i>- What did I tell you?
- May I please go to bathroom, please?</i>

10:15.381 --> 10:17.747
Yes, you may.
You do know where it is, right?

10:17.817 --> 10:19.148
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

10:19.218 --> 10:20.446
There you go.

10:20.519 --> 10:23.613
<i>Thank you for your hospitality.</i>

10:23.689 --> 10:27.489
<i>I must now go on to complete my mission.</i>

10:27.560 --> 10:29.084
I didn't even get your name.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.186
<i>It's Travis. Travis of...</i>

10:31.263 --> 10:36.166
Who's your dead friend? He's dead.
You leaving? What are you doing?

10:36.235 --> 10:39.363
You haven't even urinated
on all of my house yet.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.202
<i>I would say that perseverance...</i>

10:42.274 --> 10:46.233
<i>number-one aptitude... Attribute.</i>

10:46.579 --> 10:50.174
<i>I people person. Work good with children.</i>

10:50.249 --> 10:54.618
<i>People like me because I force them to,
with violence!</i>

10:54.987 --> 10:56.511
No, that's...

10:58.824 --> 11:01.816
Do you have any questions for me?

11:01.894 --> 11:03.054
<i>I rule you.</i>

11:03.129 --> 11:07.589
It was really nice to meet you,
and I'll let you know in the near future...

11:07.667 --> 11:09.760
if we start hiring animals.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.928
<i>Thank you, bitch. Suck it dry!</i>
