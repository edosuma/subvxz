09:22.329 --> 09:24.229
This is my chance
to rule the world!

09:24.231 --> 09:25.764
All I want is what's
coming to me!

09:25.766 --> 09:27.632
All I want is my fair share.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.501
Self-destruct!
Self-destruct!

09:29.503 --> 09:31.503
Chill out! I
have escape pods!

09:31.505 --> 09:33.138
<i>Had</i> escape pods, blue boy!

09:33.140 --> 09:34.406
We launched them.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.141
Okay... uh...

09:36.143 --> 09:38.376
Wait... the garbage.

09:38.378 --> 09:41.179
It's jettisoned in an
impact-resistant container!

09:41.181 --> 09:42.514
Oh! What?

09:42.516 --> 09:45.584
I said, it's an escape
pod full of garbage.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.152
Okay, works for me.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.387
Self-destruct in five...

09:52.291 --> 09:53.592
( <i>explosion</i> )

09:53.594 --> 09:54.793
( <i>gasping</i> )

09:54.795 --> 09:56.595
( <i>whistling through air</i> )

10:01.467 --> 10:02.867
Land ho!

10:02.869 --> 10:04.469
No kidding.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.805
( <i>laughing</i>):
We're alive!

10:06.807 --> 10:08.206
We made it!

10:08.208 --> 10:10.241
( <i>echoing laughter</i> )

10:10.243 --> 10:12.877
FATHER: "So while General
George Washington set about

10:12.879 --> 10:15.113
"finding food and shelter
for his men,

10:15.115 --> 10:17.315
"Colonel Zin Possible
snuck into the British camp

10:17.317 --> 10:18.650
to find a Christmas tree."

10:18.652 --> 10:22.120
The Yuletide has turned,
Redcoat.

10:22.122 --> 10:22.821
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

10:22.823 --> 10:24.189
Coming.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.190
Kim Possible?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.691
That's me. Thanks.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.859
Merry Christmas.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.829
Oh, would be if
I didn't have to work.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.765
I guess I shouldn't open it
until it's officially Christmas.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.767
No, it's Wade.
Open me now.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.801
A communicator?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.370
I've already got one.

10:38.372 --> 10:39.738
Exchange it, dear.

10:39.740 --> 10:43.441
You can do very well
in the after-Christmas sales.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.276
Actually, your other one
got destroyed

10:45.278 --> 10:46.378
in the stratosphere.

10:46.380 --> 10:47.712
Ron took it when he went

10:47.714 --> 10:50.515
to stop Drakken from
launching his Drakk Force One.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.483
Whoa, Wade, rewind.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.318
Ron went on a mission?
Alone?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.220
It was kind
of a Secret Santa thing.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.888
But listen, before
the explosion

10:56.890 --> 10:58.923
satellites picked up
escape pods.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.425
Ron's got to be in one of them.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.360
And these pods are where?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.862
So far, I only have a fix
on the first one.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.897
It's in London.

11:05.899 --> 11:06.931
I have to go.

11:06.933 --> 11:07.766
Of course you do.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.534
Don't worry.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.436
We'll hold the story of Colonel
Zin until you come back.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.538
No, don't ruin your Christmas.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.340
I'll get Ron, and...
and...

11:15.342 --> 11:17.542
we'll be back in time
for presents.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.414
Ron: My fault?
It's not my fault.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.782
This is so your fault.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.217
What, I'm supposed to let you
take over the world?

11:26.219 --> 11:28.853
In the spirit of the season,
yes.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.756
Oh, you want
to throw things now.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.491
Ow. Stop it!

11:35.728 --> 11:36.828
You stop it.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.396
You started it.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.700
Dude, dude stop.
That's a cell phone.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.902
Yes, it should leave
quite a welt.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.438
No, no, not for
throwing... for calling.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.539
Calling for help.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.873
Huh?

11:53.345 --> 11:55.346
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

11:56.449 --> 11:59.617
Please. I'm on vacation.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.553
Must find food.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.822
Aw, went to voice mail.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.623
Um, hello, Shego.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.725
Dr. Drakken.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.727
I hope you're having
a nice vacation.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.495
Uh, when you get the chance,

12:10.497 --> 12:12.564
could you get up here
to the North Pole

12:12.566 --> 12:13.665
and save me, please!

12:13.667 --> 12:15.500
It's cold and windy and dark,

12:15.502 --> 12:17.469
and we've got nothing to...

12:17.471 --> 12:18.803
That's my chicken.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.472
Hey, you threw it away.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.240
( <i>yelling</i> ) ( <i>screaming</i> )

12:22.242 --> 12:24.576
KIM: <i>Thanks for the
ride, Mr. Nakasumi.</i>

12:24.578 --> 12:26.578
( <i>whispering</i>)

12:27.379 --> 12:28.346
Nakasumi-san says

12:28.348 --> 12:29.647
it is the least he can do

12:29.649 --> 12:31.850
after you saved
his video game factory

12:31.852 --> 12:33.451
in time for Christmas rush.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.619
No big.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.988
I just hope I can save
this Christmas.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.890
( <i>bells ringing</i> )

As I live and breathe...
Kim Possible.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.432
Happy holiday, love.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.633
Merry Christmas.

12:48.635 --> 12:49.834
Could you tell me what happened

12:49.836 --> 12:51.002
to the guy that was in there?

12:51.004 --> 12:52.937
Weren't nobody in it.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.906
Wade, we struck out in London.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.274
Where to?

12:56.276 --> 12:56.941
Middle of the Mediterranean.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.777
Swell.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.415
( <i>gasps</i> )

( <i>squawking</i> )

13:18.497 --> 13:19.697
( <i>sighs</i> )

13:25.738 --> 13:27.005
Oh, Wade.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.073
Okay, one more in the Amazon.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.009
Please let him be in it.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.049
It's just not Christmas
without Kimmie, is it?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.083
No, it's not.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.718
You know what we have to do.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.720
Who's up for a ride
in an untested

13:42.722 --> 13:43.822
hypersonic aircraft?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.824
Hoo-sha!
Hoo-sha!

13:45.826 --> 13:47.559
Mm, thanks.

13:47.561 --> 13:48.593
Here you go.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.028
No need. It's all
been paid for.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.629
It has? By who?

13:51.631 --> 13:53.565
A gentlemen called

13:53.567 --> 13:55.733
and said he would cover
your whole vacation.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.870
"Shego, just my way of saying
thanks for a super year

13:58.872 --> 14:00.338
"and merry Christmas.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.940
Yours in evil, Dr. Drakken."

14:01.942 --> 14:03.007
That is so nice.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.076
Guess I should have
taken his call.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.378
Oh, maybe he left a message.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.596
What?

14:33.906 --> 14:36.007
Will you... ow, stop it?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.475
It's Christmas.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.044
Ron, get out of that pod
and help me.

She's right, boys.

Just like the tug-a-war

14:55.595 --> 14:57.495
at the Possible
family picnic last summer.

I can't believe you guys.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.070
Why should you have
all the fun?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.739
Can we fight another snake?

15:07.741 --> 15:08.740
Please?

15:08.742 --> 15:10.508
Wade, my family's here.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.609
I know.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.944
They called me
for your coordinates.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.712
I'm getting a distress signal
from that pod.

15:14.714 --> 15:15.847
Ron has to be in it.

15:15.849 --> 15:16.848
Well, good news there.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.449
I'll get Ron.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.918
We'll all be home
for Christmas dinner.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.486
Can we borrow the communicator?

15:21.488 --> 15:22.754
Why?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.055
We want to watch TV.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.990
Please. <i>Xtreme Xmas</i> is on.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.825
Okay, but if Wade beeps in,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.494
you've got to answer it.

Name your price, Stoppable.

Power... glory...

16:02.262 --> 16:03.928
When I take over the world,

16:03.930 --> 16:05.096
you can have a continent.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.597
Any continent.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.598
Not Europe.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.933
( <i>chattering</i>)

16:10.202 --> 16:12.136
Good idea, Rufus.
I want the phone.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.640
You drive a hard bargain.

Yes, Information.

so much better?

Hey, we're away

16:52.645 --> 16:54.612
from the thing which
was about to eat us.

In the words
of a very wise snowman,

"Put away those petty problems."

"And embrace your fellow man."

19:36.209 --> 19:37.942
You were supposed
to get to stay home

19:37.944 --> 19:40.444
and do all the Possible family
stuff you do every year.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.380
Ron, when I heard you
went after Drakken alone...

19:42.382 --> 19:43.881
You came to rescue me,

19:43.883 --> 19:45.950
and ruined
your Christmas. Man!

19:45.952 --> 19:47.151
Are you kidding me?

19:47.153 --> 19:48.186
( <i>chuckles</i>)

19:48.188 --> 19:50.054
Now the tweebs want to wrestle

19:50.056 --> 19:51.189
an anaconda every year.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.456
This Christmas rocked.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.824
I mean it.

19:53.826 --> 19:54.358
Really?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.326
It was way better

19:55.328 --> 19:57.028
than the Bueno Nacho Bueno bucks

19:57.030 --> 19:58.296
you gave me last year.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.797
( <i>laughing</i>)

19:59.799 --> 20:02.200
( <i>Shego laughs mockingly</i> )

20:02.202 --> 20:03.701
Are you two finished?

20:03.703 --> 20:04.969
Because I am not.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.337
( <i>shrieks</i>)

20:06.339 --> 20:07.905
( <i>grunts</i> )

20:09.107 --> 20:10.007
( <i>yells</i>)

20:12.879 --> 20:15.213
( <i>grunting and yelling</i>)

20:15.215 --> 20:16.781
Hey! Battle royal.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.050
From the snowy reaches
of the farthest north,

20:19.052 --> 20:20.885
<i>Xtreme!</i>

20:20.887 --> 20:23.120
Okay, and... fight!

20:23.122 --> 20:24.355
Nonsense.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.057
We were just about to sit down
to dinner.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.893
Dinner's not extreme.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.261
Yes, it is.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.396
I made cupcakes.

20:36.835 --> 20:37.969
After you.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.170
( <i>both gasp</i> )

20:41.306 --> 20:43.307
Uh, Dr. D,

20:43.309 --> 20:44.442
are you serious?

20:44.444 --> 20:46.077
Of course.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.747
Because to the people
far and near

20:49.749 --> 20:53.217
BOTH: Snowman Hank
brought holiday cheer.

20:53.219 --> 20:56.354
This is... This is, I...

20:56.356 --> 20:58.189
I don't know what this is.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.157
Look who's under the mistletoe.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.193
Well, really it's small parsley

21:02.195 --> 21:04.328
I found in a Dumpster,
but... Oh!

21:04.330 --> 21:05.529
Aw.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.231
MOTHER:
Kimmie!

21:07.233 --> 21:08.933
Are you okay?

21:08.935 --> 21:09.967
The Possibles!

21:09.969 --> 21:11.369
Join us, won't you?

21:11.371 --> 21:14.005
Isn't that Kimberly Ann's
arch-foe?

21:14.007 --> 21:16.407
( <i>chuckling</i>):
'Tis the season.

21:16.409 --> 21:18.075
Of course, once we enter
the new year,

21:18.077 --> 21:19.310
the truce is over.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.945
I'm going to open a bag of freak

21:20.947 --> 21:22.280
on all of you.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.115
This is the weirdest
Christmas ever.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.416
Hoo-sha!

21:25.418 --> 21:27.985
Hey, gang...

21:27.987 --> 21:29.887
It's not the turkey
and the stuffing,

21:29.889 --> 21:33.291
or the gifts around the tree.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.259
It's a warm and fuzzy feeling

21:35.261 --> 21:38.195
that begins with you and me.

21:38.197 --> 21:41.899
