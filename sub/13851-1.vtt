00:49.960 --> 00:51.712
Perhaps it's fate

00:51.800 --> 00:53.677
that today
is the Fourth of July.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.993
You will once again
be fighting for our freedom...

01:17.840 --> 01:20.832
Not from tyranny,
oppression, or persecution...

01:22.400 --> 01:24.072
but from annihilation.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.151
We're fighting
for our right to live.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.349
We're fighting
for our right to live.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.197
The world declared
in one voice

02:21.280 --> 02:24.238
we will not go quietly
into the night.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.392
We will not vanish
without a fight.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.312
We're going to live on.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.118
We're going to survive.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.557
Today, we celebrate our...

03:08.160 --> 03:09.496
The countless lives

03:09.520 --> 03:11.511
that we lost
in the war of '96...

03:11.680 --> 03:14.478
did not perish in vain.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.552
They inspired us
to rise from the ashes...

03:17.640 --> 03:19.198
as one people of one world.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.112
For 20 years, the world
has seen no armed conflict.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.278
Nations have put
their petty differences aside.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.034
United,
we rebuilt our families,

03:31.000 --> 03:32.069
our cities and our lives.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.634
The fusion of human and alien
technology...

03:35.800 --> 03:38.189
not only enabled us
to defy gravity

03:38.320 --> 03:40.914
and travel
with unimaginable speed...

03:41.120 --> 03:44.237
it also made our planet,
finally, safe again.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.109
Great speech, Patty.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.679
Thank you,
Madam President.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.634
One moment.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.712
We're ready
for you, sir.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.273
Captain Hiller.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.389
Welcome
to the White House.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.635
It's great to be back.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.056
I cannot tell you
how proud we are

04:11.080 --> 04:12.520
to have you
flying our flag up there.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.959
It's an honor,
Madam President.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.076
Your father
was a great man.

04:16.920 --> 04:17.954
He'd be so proud.

04:19.079 --> 04:20.720
I think you know the
Secretary of Defense.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
Sir.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.549
Nice to see
you again, son.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.836
I know I don't have to
introduce you two.

04:27.040 --> 04:29.508
Ma'am, let's get you
touched up for photo.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.908
Moving up in the world.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.270
Says America's knight
in shining armor.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.176
Oh, you're the one that's
back in the White House.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.536
Yeah, as an employee
I don't quite get

04:36.560 --> 04:38.080
the same benefits
as when I lived here.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
Captain.
Yeah?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.799
We're ready for you.
Thank you.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.109
Dylan...

04:42.840 --> 04:45.308
be nice to Jake when
you see him up there.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.000
Moon-Tug-Ten,
confirm position.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.438
Seven miles and closing.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.316
The slowest trip
of my life.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.908
Hey, cheer up.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.616
There's worse things
that you could be doing...

05:11.640 --> 05:13.710
than towing a half
trillion dollar weapon.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.075
Yeah, well, I need
a little more stimulation.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.389
Hey, you know?

05:17.480 --> 05:18.776
I didn't have to
follow you up here.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.473
Yeah, you did.
You get lonely without me.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.835
I was
the youngest valedictorian

05:23.920 --> 05:25.239
in the history
of the academy.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.912
I could have been
stationed anywhere.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.035
Like San Diego, you know?

05:28.200 --> 05:30.031
Beaches, surfing.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.600
You never surfed
a day in your life.

05:31.680 --> 05:32.715
But I'm a fast learner.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.348
And I got great balance.
Like a cat.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.152
Ah, cats hate water,
Charlie.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.353
Four percent. Reverse thrust.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.555
Roger, Tug-Ten.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.840
Reversing thrust,
four percent.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.200
The tugs and the weapon
are on final approach.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.598
They're in position,
sir.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.433
Docking in three, two...

05:50.600 --> 05:51.715
one.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.593
Initiate uncoupling
sequence.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.397
All tugs disengage.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.275
Do you realize
that there are only 36 women

06:02.360 --> 06:03.509
on this Moon Base?

06:03.680 --> 06:06.240
I'm sure one of them will
eventually come around, pal.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.160
You know, it's not like
they all rejected me.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.514
I happen to have standards.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.795
Whoa! What did you do?

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Nothing!

06:14.120 --> 06:15.633
That didn't sound
like nothing.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.776
Tug-Ten collided
with the weapon.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.976
The clamps have stopped.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.274
They're not
responding, sir.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.516
All tugs,
take evasive action.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.398
Pull back! Pull back!

06:28.480 --> 06:29.576
Charlie! It's gonna
crush the base!

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
I said pull back!

06:31.000 --> 06:32.638
That's a negative, sir.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.753
This isn't a fighter, Jake.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.955
Don't remind me!

06:40.200 --> 06:41.269
Lt. Miller...

06:41.440 --> 06:42.714
what are you idiots doing?

06:42.920 --> 06:44.399
I don't know, sir!

06:46.240 --> 06:48.754
We're gonna die!
This is how I die!

07:00.200 --> 07:01.520
Sir, he's slowing the fall.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.519
Go to your happy place.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.840
I'm kicking in
the fusion drive.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.752
Are you crazy? We'll burn up!

07:06.920 --> 07:08.433
Yeah, that's very possible!

07:13.280 --> 07:14.429
Come on!

07:23.440 --> 07:24.440
Yes!

07:24.520 --> 07:26.078
Yes!

07:26.240 --> 07:28.071
It's actually working!

07:38.440 --> 07:40.396
I honestly didn't think
that was gonna work.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.955
Oh, shit!

07:46.120 --> 07:48.475
Jiang's coming in hot
and he's got that look.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.518
He knows we don't speak
Chinese, right?

07:52.920 --> 07:54.512
Whoo!
That was a close call, sir.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.800
You almost
got us all killed.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.599
Ah, yeah...
but then I saved everyone.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.399
You don't get credit for
cleaning up your own mess.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.911
And you destroyed
one of my tugs.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.800
Uh, actually, sir,
if anybody's to blame...

08:05.880 --> 08:07.600
Sir, I lost my focus.
It won't happen again.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.398
No, it won't.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.400
You're grounded
until further notice.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.679
Can I still watch TV or...

08:16.800 --> 08:17.856
You didn't have to
take the fall.

08:17.880 --> 08:18.880
Yeah, well...

08:18.960 --> 08:21.076
He already hates me.
Why break tradition?

08:22.800 --> 08:25.234
Transport 103-ARP-1.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.233
General Adams,
we are being directed

08:28.360 --> 08:30.191
to Alien Prison, Platform 1.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.197
General.
This better be good.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.874
My wife and I were enjoying
a very nice morning...

08:44.080 --> 08:45.911
in a very expensive
bed and breakfast.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.235
I'm sorry, sir.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.595
I thought you should see this.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
Sir.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.590
It started
a couple of hours ago.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.630
Look how
their behavior changed.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.878
After 20 years
of being catatonic.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.837
Get me Director
Levinson.

09:10.920 --> 09:11.920
We tried.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.311
He's unreachable, sir.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.856
You need to take me seriously.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.056
I've been chasing you
across the planet

09:25.080 --> 09:26.080
for three weeks now.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.388
But now that I have you...

09:27.560 --> 09:29.232
Excuse me,
who are you again?

09:29.400 --> 09:30.400
Floyd Rosenberg.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.833
Government appointed
controller.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.976
Please be advised.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.319
Entering hostile territories.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.594
We should slow down.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.640
We don't wanna look like
we're posing a threat.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.496
Now, we're gonna start
with Appendix 2.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.600
I know a lot of people have

09:40.640 --> 09:41.736
a negative reaction
to being audited.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.976
But I've found it's
a constructive experience.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Lloyd. Lloyd, Lloyd.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.080
It's Floyd.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.176
We have to meet
a friend right now,

09:46.200 --> 09:47.679
a great guy.
Come say hi.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.073
Where are we?

09:56.440 --> 09:59.432
Director Levinson.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.514
Who are those men?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.636
It's Umbutu's
rebel forces.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.199
The warlord?

10:07.880 --> 10:09.680
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.560
His old man just died
and I hear that the son

10:11.600 --> 10:13.318
is much more of a moderate.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.277
Uh, hey, fellas...

10:15.440 --> 10:16.919
howdy doody. Say, um...

10:17.080 --> 10:19.275
I'm looking for
Dikembe Umbutu.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.718
I see you found
their armory.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.112
The one and only,
David Levinson.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.551
Catherine, wow!

10:30.640 --> 10:32.358
What are you doing here?

10:32.520 --> 10:34.033
You don't think
you're the only expert

10:34.120 --> 10:35.314
he called, do you?

10:35.480 --> 10:37.755
I'm so surprised to see you,
a little bit.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.912
I'm a little surprised
that you remember my name.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.548
Hey, hey, come on.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.676
Let's be professional.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.837
Well, we both remember
what happened

10:47.920 --> 10:50.070
the last time we tried
to be professional.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.151
I'm sensing
a palpable tension here.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.629
We've bumped into each other
at a few conferences.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.679
I bet you have.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.035
Shut up, Floyd.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.456
Director Levinson, I'm sorry.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.833
We're not done
our business here.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.229
What papers?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.311
Uh, it looks like this.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.440
Um...

11:09.040 --> 11:10.996
So, why does Umbutu Junior
need a psychiatrist?

11:11.160 --> 11:12.513
Unresolved daddy issues?

11:13.160 --> 11:16.835
His people fought a ground war
with the aliens for 10 years.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.309
Their connection is
the strongest I've ever seen.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.596
It's as if their
mind is...

11:21.760 --> 11:23.318
tapped into
the alien subconscious.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.400
Yeah.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.915
Your obsession with
the human-alien

11:27.040 --> 11:28.917
psychic residual
condition.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.430
Yeah, you calling me
obsessive. That's cute.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.395
How did they get
the lights on?

11:49.680 --> 11:50.749
We didn't.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.872
It happened on its own.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.473
Two days ago.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.376
Of course,
you're aware that this is

12:04.400 --> 12:06.118
the only ship
that landed in '96.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.151
And so, I appreciate
you finally granting us

12:08.240 --> 12:09.832
this access, Mr. Umbutu.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.156
Your father
was very tenacious.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.395
His pride caused
the death

12:13.480 --> 12:14.993
of more than
half of my people...

12:15.080 --> 12:16.656
- including my brother.
- I'm so sorry.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
Be careful!

12:17.760 --> 12:18.954
Whoa!

12:19.040 --> 12:20.075
Wow!

12:21.280 --> 12:22.793
What happened here?

12:22.960 --> 12:24.598
They were drilling.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.028
For what?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.758
Man, I don't know.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.151
When did
the drilling stop?

12:30.320 --> 12:32.231
When you blew up
the Mothership.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.312
Right now, for us,
any way to get up there?

12:35.520 --> 12:37.909
You're not afraid
of heights, are you?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.359
How high is it?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.592
Oh, my God!

13:17.880 --> 13:20.110
That's that same pattern.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.677
So the signal
was coming from this ship.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.519
20 years ago...

13:27.680 --> 13:30.114
when we destroyed
the Mothership

13:30.200 --> 13:31.315
we detected a burst...

13:31.480 --> 13:32.879
in an X-band frequency...

13:33.080 --> 13:35.435
directed toward deep space.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
Oh.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.279
Today is the Fourth of July.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.192
The distress call.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.918
Today is the Fourth of July.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.870
Looks like someone picked up
the phone and answered.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.034
I'm going crazy up here.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.559
I can't take it anymore.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.234
Tell me how much you miss me.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.776
Actually,
the Chief of Staff

14:09.800 --> 14:11.472
just got a really
handsome intern.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.313
Not quite as tall as you,
but has great dimples...

14:14.440 --> 14:15.840
and plays the cello.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.793
Mmm. You know
how much I miss you.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.256
You know what?
I'm gonna steal a tug

14:20.280 --> 14:21.376
and come back
and see you right now.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
No.
Please don't.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.668
Because last time
you did that

14:23.800 --> 14:25.119
they added a month
to your tour.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.936
Come on. Tell me that wasn't
the best two minutes

14:26.960 --> 14:28.279
of your life.
Yes.

14:28.440 --> 14:30.954
Yes, but I would like my
fiancé back permanently.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.995
What was that?

14:36.160 --> 14:37.376
Ah, we've been getting
these power surges

14:37.400 --> 14:38.594
the last couple days.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.080
You take a look
at the houses I sent you?

14:42.280 --> 14:44.157
No, I haven't yet.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.519
It's okay. There's no rush.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.437
I saw Dylan
at the White House today.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.956
I just think you two
need to have a conversation.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.720
So he's shaking hands
with the president

14:54.800 --> 14:56.028
and I'm stuck on the Moon.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.318
That must be nice.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.351
You nearly killed him,
remember?

15:00.520 --> 15:01.919
Give him
a little credit, Jake.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.634
P?

15:06.680 --> 15:08.193
Thank you for using QQ.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.118
Ladies and gentlemen...

15:17.280 --> 15:18.280
please welcome

15:18.320 --> 15:20.197
the International
Legacy Squadron.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.096
Captain Hiller,

15:24.120 --> 15:25.496
considering he died
during a test flight...

15:25.520 --> 15:26.976
how do you feel
taking off for the Moon

15:27.000 --> 15:29.230
from a hangar
named after your father?

15:30.240 --> 15:31.468
He would have loved it.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.479
It's too bad
he's not here to see it.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.720
Captain Lao,
China has been integral

15:35.840 --> 15:37.671
to the Earth
Space Defense Program.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.080
Is there anything you want to
say to the folks back home?

15:43.360 --> 15:46.033
I didn't want to text you.
I wanted to hear your voice.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.509
What's wrong?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.399
Nothing.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.431
My boy making a name
for himself.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.359
Are you gonna be okay, Ma?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.556
Just tell me
you'll be careful up there.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.555
Moon Base,
this is Legacy Squadron.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.880
We're on final approach,
requesting permission to land.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.114
Permission granted.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.197
Welcome to the Moon, Captain.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.196
Just keep it cool.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.920
Just don't hit him. It's easy.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.232
Do I get
an autograph, too?

16:47.880 --> 16:48.915
Back to work.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.793
Uncle Jiang!

16:53.400 --> 16:55.277
You look more and more
like your mother.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.115
There is nothing a girl wants
to hear more than that.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.279
Mengniu Moon Milk.

17:09.720 --> 17:11.438
I've been looking
all over for you.

17:11.599 --> 17:12.794
I've got good news.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.319
Yeah?
That pilot that China sent...

17:14.440 --> 17:16.476
is my future wife
and I mean it.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.113
I think my heart exploded.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.271
It's like our souls
were communing.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.473
He just walked in,
didn't he?

17:25.640 --> 17:26.675
Yeah, he did.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.795
Okay.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.796
You're not gonna
finish this?

17:41.320 --> 17:42.514
You mind moving?

17:46.320 --> 17:48.629
We both know what happens
when you get in my way.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.238
Oh.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.136
I waited a long time
to do that.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.160
Morrison!

17:58.360 --> 17:59.918
What's going on here?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.318
I asked you
a question.

18:05.160 --> 18:07.913
Yes, uh, sir,
the floor is very slippery.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.357
Be careful if I were you.
Great to see you, Dylan.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.549
I was so close to
punching him back.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.039
I think you made
the right choice.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.633
You did almost kill him...

18:25.720 --> 18:27.756
but that's why
they have ejection seats.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.712
No, I went too far.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.196
It's the only way I thought
I could stand out.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.352
It was never gonna be you
leading that squadron.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.909
That's not the way
the world works.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.036
You know? He's royalty.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.428
We're just orphans.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.951
The last thing I said to my
parents was I hated them.

18:52.560 --> 18:53.880
The only reason
I'm still alive...

18:53.960 --> 18:55.960
is because they dropped me
off at that stupid camp.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.237
Well, I'm glad they did.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.279
Because you're
the only family I got.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.240
All right, final training hop.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.633
Winner leads
the Legacy Squadron.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.096
Why don't you just
give up, Morrison?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.920
Second place will just
have to be good enough.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.896
Yeah, we'll see
about that, Captain Hiller.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.989
Passing on the left.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.080
Hey, there's not enough room.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.760
Damn it, Jake.
You're gonna clip my wing.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.319
Control, I'm going down.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.072
Ejecting! Ejecting!

19:33.440 --> 19:34.589
Dr. O'Brien,

19:34.680 --> 19:36.160
please report
to the surgical theater.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.797
Good morning, Brakish.
How are we today?

19:44.320 --> 19:45.799
I brought you
a new one.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.269
Dactylorhiza maculata...

19:49.440 --> 19:50.998
or the spotted orchid.

19:51.160 --> 19:54.038
And when it fully blooms,
the lavender...

19:54.200 --> 19:56.031
It's going to
take your breath away.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.234
Can you believe it?

19:58.320 --> 20:01.596
You've been in a coma
for 7300 days.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.631
I made you a gift.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.279
I took a knitting class.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.555
Is it itchy?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.232
You'd tell me
if it was itchy, right?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.552
Oh, God.

20:16.120 --> 20:17.314
You're awake!

20:18.040 --> 20:19.996
Did we win?

20:21.360 --> 20:23.510
Eric, bring in the medical team.
He's awake!

20:24.720 --> 20:26.870
Where's my glasses?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.109
I can't see.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.200
Oh, they're right here.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.469
Oh, yeah.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
How long was I out?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.710
Long time, baby.
Long time.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.036
Oh, yeah. I can see that.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Babe...

20:39.360 --> 20:40.839
you got a bit fat.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.991
And really bald.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.149
But you still look great.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.152
This just
came in from Hubble.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.515
There's some kind of force
pulling at Saturn's rings.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.829
Holy Christ!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.399
What about
our defense base there?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.879
It's gone.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.234
And it's not just
the base.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.191
It's like the whole moon
just vanished.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.599
Up the alert level
to red.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.760
Right away.

21:16.440 --> 21:17.668
Hey, honey.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.678
Listen, I want you to
pack up your stuff

21:20.800 --> 21:23.030
and go to your sister's
right now.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.096
Whoa. But this symbol
comes up more often...

21:36.120 --> 21:38.475
than anything
I've encountered.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.039
Look at the similarities.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.556
How can you not see
the relevance?

21:42.720 --> 21:43.776
No, it's not that
I don't see it.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.056
I just feel like right
now, there are more

21:45.080 --> 21:46.877
pressing matters
than analyzing doodles.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.600
Like a giant space ship
turning back on.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.914
Sir.
Yeah?

21:50.120 --> 21:51.480
We've lost all contact
with Saturn.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
What?

21:52.760 --> 21:53.856
We need to notify
the president.

21:53.880 --> 21:54.880
Already tried.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.936
Tanner said he'll get back
to us after the press tour.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.359
Bypass Tanner
however you can.

21:58.440 --> 21:59.640
We need to talk
to Lanford now.

21:59.720 --> 22:00.869
Right.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.995
Thank you.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.555
At least your father
spared the elephants.

22:08.760 --> 22:09.795
Good for him.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.918
Look.
The Roswell crash in '47.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.958
The farmer who made contact
drew the same circle.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.473
And every time
I interview

22:17.600 --> 22:19.238
one of my patients
and show them this...

22:19.440 --> 22:22.352
they all express
the same emotion.

22:22.760 --> 22:23.909
Fear.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.272
I don't think
it's a circle.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.793
The night the ship
turned on...

22:27.960 --> 22:30.997
I experienced the strongest
vision I've ever had.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.755
And I drew this.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.280
That's incredible.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.476
How did you decipher
so much of their language?

22:51.280 --> 22:53.111
They were hunting us.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.200
We had to learn
how to hunt them.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.119
That means you're beautiful.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.315
Aw, thanks, man.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.480
Not you.

23:05.640 --> 23:07.631
You have to remove
the sub-sonic inlets...

23:07.800 --> 23:08.840
before you can reconfigure

23:08.880 --> 23:10.016
the thermalized
plasma cartridges.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.336
That's great. Why don't
you put that thing down

23:11.360 --> 23:12.360
and help me?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.713
There she is.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.473
Oh! It's happening.
God damn it.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.358
The chemical reaction,
the pheromones...

23:19.520 --> 23:21.988
all of the blood in my body,
it's rushing to my head.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.515
Your head, huh?

23:23.680 --> 23:24.816
I'm gonna go
introduce myself.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.989
Yeah. No problem.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Ah! Shit!

23:30.240 --> 23:32.071
So, you must be
the pilot China sent.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.753
Did the giant flag
give it away?

23:33.840 --> 23:34.840
It was that.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.136
And the fact that I heard you
speaking Chinese earlier.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.056
Anyway, I was wondering if
you wanted to get a drink.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.718
Maybe fall in love.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.992
Aren't you a little
young for that?

23:43.160 --> 23:45.549
I'm 23 and a half.

23:54.720 --> 23:55.994
All personnel,

23:56.120 --> 23:58.190
report to your stations
immediately.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.876
All personnel, report to
your stations immediately.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.393
Arm the primary.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.237
Get me the Security Council.
Yes, sir.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
On screen.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
Sir?

24:31.080 --> 24:33.071
Yeah?
This just came in.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.799
It was a spaceship.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.759
Madam President.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.433
The heads of state
are coming online.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.398
David, are you
seeing this?

24:50.560 --> 24:52.391
Yes, Madam President.
I'm looking right at it.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.392
They could be
initiating an attack.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.919
We need to strike first.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.116
Uh, hold on. Hang on a second.
To my eye...

25:01.280 --> 25:03.748
the design and the
technology of this ship...

25:03.920 --> 25:05.911
is nothing like the ones
that attacked us.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.296
I'm telling you,
this is not them.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.469
And what if
you're wrong?

25:08.640 --> 25:09.914
If you're wrong...

25:10.080 --> 25:12.120
we could be starting a war
with a whole new species.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.896
At this point,
we know the Saturn base

25:13.920 --> 25:14.989
has been destroyed.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.792
Madam President,
this could very well

25:16.920 --> 25:18.353
be a coordinated
attack.

25:18.520 --> 25:20.112
Get the cannon
into firing position.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.200
Yes, sir.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.456
We should be cautious...

25:23.480 --> 25:25.357
and listen to
Director Levinson.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.631
How does the rest
of the Council feel?

25:27.800 --> 25:29.438
Let's hold off
until we know more.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.592
We have to be decisive.
I vote to attack.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.313
I also vote to strike.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.160
Madam President...

25:38.280 --> 25:39.679
I need an answer.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.473
Take them out, Commander.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.480
We are locked on.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.800
I think this is a mistake.
Let's take another moment...

25:47.840 --> 25:48.955
Fire!

26:07.840 --> 26:09.159
Get me an image.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.552
It crashed in
the Van de Graaff Crater.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.475
We're not picking up
any signs of life.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.720
Let's hope to God
we did the right thing.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.296
Madam President,
we need to send

26:20.320 --> 26:21.736
a team up to investigate
the wreckage.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.035
We need to know
who we just shot down.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.160
There's no sign
of life

26:25.200 --> 26:26.336
and the threat's
been neutralized.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.920
We can send a team up,
but David needs to be in D.C.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.436
No. Can we not
make this political?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.875
I need to get up there
and get answers.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.416
David, you can lead
a team up there...

26:35.440 --> 26:37.396
but after the
celebration.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.833
You heard the president.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.376
I'll expect to see you
next to us tomorrow

26:41.400 --> 26:42.549
wearing your best smile.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.160
You want to
see my best smile?

26:46.600 --> 26:47.874
Did he just hang up on me?

26:48.080 --> 26:50.036
It sure sounded
that way to me, sir.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.120
Where are you going?

26:54.560 --> 26:57.074
Jake. I really think you
should think this through.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.355
Okay, everyone...

26:58.520 --> 27:00.795
get out! I'm taking off.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.555
Wait, wait, wait!

27:04.720 --> 27:05.869
Our tug's not
gonna fly.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.190
That's why we're taking
Mike's tug.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.078
Oh. Jiang is not
gonna like this.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.749
At approximately 2100 hours

27:12.880 --> 27:14.552
Earth's Space
Defense Program...

27:14.720 --> 27:17.632
repelled an alien attack
targeting our planet.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.559
It wasn't them.

27:22.720 --> 27:23.948
You can't know
that for sure.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.229
It wasn't them.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.719
I have to tell
the world.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.000
Sir, it's time
for your meds.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.071
I have to talk to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff!

27:30.240 --> 27:32.117
Matthew, can you just
give us a second, please?

27:37.560 --> 27:40.393
You shouldn't be wasting your
time with a crazy old man.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.552
You gave up flying
to take care of me...

27:42.760 --> 27:44.591
and I know how much
you loved it.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.671
You should be with Jake.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.157
He's on the Moon, remember?

27:52.120 --> 27:53.917
Then you should be
with the president.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.593
I am with the president.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.837
They're coming back.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.913
And this time
we won't be able to stop them.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.315
I will avenge you, brother.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.236
Hey, wait! I need a receipt!

28:54.160 --> 28:56.515
So,
how do you know this guy?

28:56.680 --> 28:59.148
Oh, he's
Patricia Whitmore's fiancé.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.389
Thank you so much.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.640
Good job, Collins.
Yes, sir.

29:01.840 --> 29:02.989
Someone call a cab?

29:03.560 --> 29:05.312
Thanks for doing this, Jake.
No problem.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.296
Let's get moving, though,
because I stole this thing.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.320
I'm coming with you.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.869
Um, no.
This is an ESD operation.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.554
Strictly off limits
to all civilians...

29:13.720 --> 29:15.039
and warlords.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.519
I let you in.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.750
It would be wise for you
to return the favor.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.336
And there he goes.
Where's he going?

29:28.360 --> 29:29.509
Oh, I'm coming, too.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
Catherine!

29:30.680 --> 29:31.856
Something is drawing
him out there...

29:31.880 --> 29:33.359
and I'm going to
find out what.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.033
Excuse me,
uh, Director Levinson.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.800
Where the heck
do you think you're going?

29:36.920 --> 29:38.800
Why don't you join us, Floyd?
Everybody else is.

29:38.880 --> 29:39.915
Might do you some good.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.189
No. No, no, no.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.376
You're not
getting on that thing.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.400
And neither am I.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.516
We're gonna stay here
and we're gonna...

29:48.040 --> 29:49.268
Hi.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.096
I've never been
in a space tug before.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.336
Is there anything
I should know?

29:52.360 --> 29:53.918
There's a lot
you should know.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.637
Seatbelts, obviously.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.231
David, why don't you
take a seat.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.480
Where? Really?

30:01.640 --> 30:03.278
What's the matter,
are you nervous?

30:03.440 --> 30:04.800
Uh, you know,
it's not my favorite.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.030
Ah, don't worry.
I haven't crashed in...

30:07.760 --> 30:09.034
a couple days.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.434
But that was intentional.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.160
What?

30:12.560 --> 30:13.595
Okay, here we go.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.232
I forgot how
much I hate this.

30:21.560 --> 30:22.834
Bye!

30:36.840 --> 30:38.717
Mmm. Mmm.

30:38.800 --> 30:39.915
That wasn't so bad.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.152
I haven't kicked on
the fusion drive, yet.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.440
Huh?

30:54.280 --> 30:56.157
And in
our darkest moment...

30:56.320 --> 30:57.833
when all hope was lost...

30:58.040 --> 30:59.632
I said, "Never give up.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.597
"You have to have faith."

31:02.760 --> 31:06.036
And in that moment,
it came to me, "pow!"...

31:06.320 --> 31:07.878
like a thunderbolt.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.349
And that's when
I came up with the idea

31:11.440 --> 31:12.714
that saved the world.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.200
Yeah.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.633
Um... Sir.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.640
Huh?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.034
Ah. There he is.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.679
Welcome back.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.633
This book is a bargain.

31:27.800 --> 31:28.949
$9.95.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.997
It makes a great gift
for your grandchildren.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.152
If you're lucky enough
to have any.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
Are you ready to go?

31:36.480 --> 31:37.480
Don't rush.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.355
Dad, you awake?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.560
I thought we could watch the
celebration on TV together.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.069
Matthew!

31:59.680 --> 32:00.680
What was that?

32:00.760 --> 32:01.760
Mmm, we're flying through

32:01.840 --> 32:03.160
the old Mothership's
debris field.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.071
Don't worry. These are
basically space tanks.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.513
Space tanks? Really?

32:21.320 --> 32:23.595
We're coming up
to the Van de Graaff crater.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
There it is.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.748
That's the crash site.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.352
Today, we are honored...

32:39.560 --> 32:42.358
to be in the presence of some
of the brave men and women...

32:42.560 --> 32:44.835
who defied
insurmountable odds...

32:45.000 --> 32:47.719
and led us to victory
over alien invaders...

32:47.880 --> 32:49.472
two decades ago.

32:49.640 --> 32:53.269
General Grey and
his beautiful wife, Audrey.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.835
We thank you for your
unwavering leadership.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.560
Jeffrey.
Where the hell is Levinson?

33:04.720 --> 33:06.358
So,
what are we looking for?

33:06.520 --> 33:10.115
Well, I'm hoping
we'll know when we see it.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.999
Is there a way of seeing
what they're seeing?

33:13.160 --> 33:15.549
You can even talk to them.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.759
Nice tattoos.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.109
That's how many aliens
you killed, right?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.229
How did you do it?

33:25.040 --> 33:27.076
You have to get them
from behind.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.312
Catherine...

33:34.520 --> 33:37.671
I think I just found another
one of your doodles.

33:41.080 --> 33:45.870
Charlie, tell command
to prep the lab at Area 51.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.510
How's it looking up there,
Captain Hiller?

33:55.720 --> 33:57.096
It's truly humbling
to see how beautiful

33:57.120 --> 33:58.712
Earth is from here,
Madam President.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.079
On this day, in 1996...

34:02.240 --> 34:04.310
President Whitmore
passionately declared...

34:04.520 --> 34:07.830
"We will not go
quietly into the night."

34:08.000 --> 34:09.638
And we did not.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.234
President Whitmore!

34:12.840 --> 34:13.955
What a surprise!

34:14.920 --> 34:15.920
Ladies and gentlemen...

34:16.480 --> 34:18.277
another great war hero.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.273
The one and only,
President Thomas Whitmore.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.551
Please say a few words.

34:25.679 --> 34:26.873
Today...

34:29.120 --> 34:30.393
Not going to be...

34:32.040 --> 34:34.713
I came to warn you.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.400
Help me!

35:19.400 --> 35:22.392
That is definitely bigger
than the last one.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.791
Holy shit.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.674
Charlie, I think you
better come and get us.

35:39.760 --> 35:40.954
Sooner the better.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.189
As in right now!

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
I'm already on it!

35:43.400 --> 35:45.595
Everybody strap in!
It's gonna get bumpy!

35:51.960 --> 35:53.440
Charlie,
where the hell are you?

35:53.480 --> 35:55.000
Just flying through
my worst nightmare!

36:11.400 --> 36:12.435
David!

36:13.440 --> 36:15.431
Grab my hand!
Come on, reach!

36:17.400 --> 36:18.594
We're in! Close the ramp!

36:20.360 --> 36:22.920
This just came in from one
of our lunar satellites.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.672
The ship's more than
3,000 miles in diameter.

36:28.080 --> 36:29.991
How the hell
did we miss this?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.358
Activate all our
defense systems

36:32.440 --> 36:34.192
and shut down the celebration.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.875
Attention! We have
an emergency situation!

36:37.040 --> 36:38.040
Madam President.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.428
Move.
Get her out of here.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.637
Please leave the premises
in a calm and orderly fashion.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.876
I repeat,
please leave the premises

36:44.960 --> 36:46.757
in a calm and orderly fashion.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.478
Gotta move!
Not without that piece!

36:48.680 --> 36:49.856
Yeah, I thought
you were gonna say that.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.313
Charlie,
get on the arms.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.279
Talk to me, Charlie.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.273
What's happening?

37:03.440 --> 37:04.880
Damn it!
What do you mean, "damn it"?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.353
I'm trying my best!

37:06.520 --> 37:08.033
Stop fighting!
Just grab it!

37:13.520 --> 37:15.158
Got it! Go, go!

37:22.640 --> 37:25.234
There's a flying mountain
coming right for us!

37:29.880 --> 37:30.880
Hold on!

37:38.360 --> 37:40.316
Oh, shit!
I'm losing speed!

37:41.120 --> 37:43.076
Jesus, it has
its own gravity.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.160
What does that mean?

37:44.280 --> 37:45.520
It means
we're going for a ride.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.520
You mean
we're stuck under this thing?

37:52.640 --> 37:54.153
Arm the primary!

37:59.480 --> 38:00.993
We're powered up
and locked on.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.360
Fire!

38:08.240 --> 38:10.117
Negative impact.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.957
Negative impact.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.920
- Permission to engage.
- Negative.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.758
All fighters,
clear the blast zone.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.797
Arm the primary
and fire again!

38:27.920 --> 38:29.478
Above us.
Something's happening.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.520
Sir.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.116
Evacuate, everyone!

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
Go!

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
Rain, watch out!

39:02.480 --> 39:05.153
All fighters, fall back!
Fall back!

39:05.680 --> 39:06.874
Copy.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.160
It's projected to enter

39:13.240 --> 39:14.520
Earth's atmosphere
in 22 minutes.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.357
If it doesn't alter
its current velocity...

39:16.520 --> 39:17.776
it's gonna crack
the planet in half.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.472
We're not gonna
let that happen, Tanner.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.696
Initiate the
Orbital Defense System.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.720
Yes, ma'am.

39:26.560 --> 39:27.616
General Adams,

39:27.640 --> 39:28.880
we are primed
and ready to fire.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.990
Initiate
simultaneous countdown.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.396
Roger, Command. Syncing now.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.594
Starting countdown.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.118
Ten... Nine...

39:43.480 --> 39:45.914
Eight... Seven... Six...

39:46.080 --> 39:47.479
Five... Four...

39:47.640 --> 39:49.471
Three... Two...

39:53.800 --> 39:54.800
General...

39:54.960 --> 39:56.200
the Asian Pacific
Defense System

39:56.240 --> 39:57.640
went offline
before they could fire.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.238
Yes, sir. Copy that.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.515
Jake's alive!

40:02.680 --> 40:04.477
He radioed us
from the Moon!

40:04.640 --> 40:06.073
He's with Director Levinson.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.593
They're on their way
to Area 51.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.315
That Hercules right
there is on stand-by.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.477
Madam President,
can you take my father

40:15.600 --> 40:16.635
to Cheyenne Mountain?

40:16.720 --> 40:17.948
Yes, of course.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.314
I'm going
with you, Patty.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.714
Dad!

40:21.120 --> 40:22.155
You're gonna need me.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.920
Wish us luck.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Ma'am,
we have to go.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.360
Director Levinson...

40:44.560 --> 40:46.152
I'm gonna talk
to my supervisor...

40:46.320 --> 40:48.515
and make sure you get
all the money you need.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.675
What are those green lights?

41:55.920 --> 41:57.920
The ship will
touch down over the Atlantic.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.040
Which part?
All of it, ma'am.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.515
Issue an evacuation
order for every coastline.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.477
I don't think
there's time.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.560
So, what's the plan?

42:05.640 --> 42:06.755
We have less than
20 minutes

42:06.840 --> 42:08.056
to get every patient
out of here.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.354
Move!
Yes, Ma'am.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.640
We still have
two in surgery.

42:10.680 --> 42:12.016
Get them in post-op
as fast as you can.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.075
Absolutely.

42:16.240 --> 42:17.275
Help, please!

42:17.440 --> 42:19.080
I got you, honey.
I'm not gonna leave you.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.156
What goes up, must come down.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.789
Whoa!

42:33.880 --> 42:34.995
Oh, we're free!
Oh, God.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.752
Don't worry,
we're in a controlled dive.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.319
Falling!
It's called falling!

42:38.480 --> 42:39.515
Nope. Controlled dive.

42:57.840 --> 42:58.840
Whoa.

43:07.320 --> 43:08.514
Nice, nice.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.233
Jesus.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.913
They like to get the landmarks.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.280
Are we dead?

43:32.760 --> 43:33.954
We're okay.

43:35.440 --> 43:36.475
Pee your pants?

43:37.320 --> 43:38.594
Yeah!

43:39.480 --> 43:40.480
Me too.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.936
We can access
the trench through here.

43:46.960 --> 43:47.960
Are you sure?

43:48.240 --> 43:49.389
Mmm-hmm.
Hundred percent.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.636
This, right here.
That's the best way in.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.074
Yeah, I got it.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.000
Captain, they're ordering
all ships out of the area.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.712
There's a hundred
million dollars' worth

43:57.800 --> 43:59.438
of gold on that ship.

43:59.600 --> 44:00.874
They think
we're gonna leave it?

44:00.960 --> 44:02.075
They're out of their minds.

44:02.760 --> 44:03.760
Capitaine...

44:04.240 --> 44:06.117
you better come
and see this.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.896
To all aircraft

44:49.920 --> 44:51.592
within the sound
of my voice...

44:51.680 --> 44:53.033
we expect the devastation

44:53.120 --> 44:54.800
to the East Coast
to be beyond imagination.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.673
The rally point
for all remaining aircraft...

44:57.760 --> 44:58.795
is Area 51.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.114
Rain, you take the lead.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.315
I'll meet you there.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.072
I gotta see about someone.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.715
Good luck.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.120
Are you okay?

45:13.480 --> 45:15.311
My mother lives in London.

45:16.120 --> 45:17.872
Maybe she made it out.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.359
Yeah, maybe.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.755
Dad, where are you?

45:26.840 --> 45:28.558
On my boat. Where else?

45:28.720 --> 45:30.880
David, this one is definitely
bigger than the last one.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.872
You can see it?

45:35.080 --> 45:36.696
Uh, listen to me.
You have to get to shore...

45:36.720 --> 45:38.676
as fast as you can. Dad!

45:38.760 --> 45:39.760
David? David!

45:45.520 --> 45:47.192
Oh, sweet Moses.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.880
Wait!

45:58.120 --> 46:00.680
Wait!

46:07.760 --> 46:09.273
We're gonna die.

46:09.440 --> 46:10.919
No, no. Look at me.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.473
We are not going
to die.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.671
Marine 3, clear.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.136
I got bodies
on that hospital roof

46:16.160 --> 46:17.752
that need immediate evac.

46:24.280 --> 46:27.033
Yes! Yes, come on!
Let's go!

46:28.560 --> 46:30.357
Hand him the baby.
It's okay.

46:30.480 --> 46:31.480
Okay. Please
be careful.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.240
You're gonna be all right.
He's got her.

46:33.360 --> 46:34.554
Get on board. Get on board.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.153
We gotta go right now.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.440
Good girl.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Mom!

46:41.080 --> 46:42.080
Pull her up!

46:42.240 --> 46:43.992
Pull her up! No!

46:44.160 --> 46:45.354
No, Mom!

46:45.520 --> 46:47.351
No!

46:52.920 --> 46:54.114
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, my!

47:01.520 --> 47:03.317
Why did I buy this boat?

47:07.200 --> 47:08.200
Whoa! Whoa!

47:30.320 --> 47:32.040
Glad to have you back,
Mr. President.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.349
Been far too long.

47:33.560 --> 47:34.709
Thank you.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.279
Is David Levinson here?

47:36.440 --> 47:37.555
Not yet.

47:37.720 --> 47:39.836
Morrison's tug is still
10 minutes out.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.356
Have them meet us
at the prison.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.476
We need to
interrogate one.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.398
What the...

48:27.400 --> 48:28.469
They've gotten worse.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.154
Much worse.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.671
Mr. President?

48:35.840 --> 48:37.398
Dr. Okun.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.628
You're awake.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.119
Very much so.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.308
Why are they screaming?

48:44.040 --> 48:45.632
No, no, no.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.199
They're not screaming.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.952
They're celebrating.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.999
General,
one of the prison cells

49:03.080 --> 49:04.559
is docking with the chamber.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.994
Where's my dad?

49:06.160 --> 49:07.718
I think he went
in there.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.239
Get the weapons!
Let's go!

49:09.360 --> 49:10.360
Let's go!

49:10.520 --> 49:12.875
We have alien guns?

49:15.720 --> 49:18.154
Isolation chamber activated.

49:26.200 --> 49:27.633
How did he get in here?

49:28.840 --> 49:30.159
Dad, it's too dangerous!

49:30.360 --> 49:31.480
Someone get him
out of there!

49:31.560 --> 49:32.560
He overrode the system.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.835
Sir, please
unlock the door!

49:34.000 --> 49:35.638
Don't you worry
about me.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.836
Just get as many
answers as you can.

49:38.640 --> 49:39.675
No, don't!

49:50.560 --> 49:52.471
Whitmore locked
himself in.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.832
Can you hear us?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.434
She has arrived.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.359
Who is she?

50:16.520 --> 50:18.590
She...

50:18.760 --> 50:20.273
is all.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.713
What does she want?

50:29.720 --> 50:31.756
What does this mean?
What does this symbol mean?

50:33.040 --> 50:35.270
Why are you afraid of it?

50:36.800 --> 50:37.800
It's killing him!

50:37.960 --> 50:38.960
That's enough!

50:39.120 --> 50:40.758
Move!
Kill it now!

51:18.560 --> 51:19.560
Dad!

51:23.440 --> 51:24.475
He's breathing.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.318
Someone call
a medical team!

51:32.640 --> 51:33.834
Is it dead?

51:34.560 --> 51:35.560
I told you.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.360
You kill them
from behind.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.519
Daisy, stop crying.

51:44.680 --> 51:46.033
She's scared.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.336
An evacuation order...

51:47.360 --> 51:48.536
of the southern
and eastern coastal regions...

51:48.560 --> 51:49.595
I want Mommy.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.776
Of the Unites States
is in effect.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.800
We'll find her.

51:51.840 --> 51:53.193
They're both dead.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.316
Just shut up, okay?
That's enough.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.856
You don't even
have your license!

51:56.880 --> 51:58.552
Um, look around you.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.336
You think anyone's
gonna pull us over?

52:00.360 --> 52:01.873
The radio said
to go inland...

52:02.040 --> 52:03.393
so that's where I'm going.

52:03.560 --> 52:05.915
Proceed in an orderly fashion.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.354
There's a guy
in that boat!

52:07.560 --> 52:08.754
I am not stopping.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.035
Look, he was moving!

52:10.160 --> 52:11.195
He needs our help!

52:11.360 --> 52:12.429
Sam, stop the car.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.398
Unbelievable.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.077
Hurry up, okay?

52:29.720 --> 52:32.029
I think he's just
knocked out!

52:35.760 --> 52:37.496
I don't think
it's a coincidence...

52:37.520 --> 52:39.875
that this thing showed up
just before they did.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.040
No, I think you're right.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.150
Brakish, you should
be in bed, babe.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.072
Where did you get this?

52:46.760 --> 52:49.069
That's from the ship
that we shot down.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.118
We need to cut this open.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.376
Director Levinson...

52:54.400 --> 52:55.958
proceed to Command Center
immediately.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.588
Call us soon as
you have anything.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.910
Come on, people. Move!

53:01.080 --> 53:04.550
Baby, I'm so happy that you
want to dive back into work.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.392
Maybe we should
get you some pants.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.480
Pants?

53:08.600 --> 53:09.600
All right. Go on.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.115
Why didn't you tell me
my butt was hanging out?

53:14.920 --> 53:17.229
We have infrared
of the alien ship, sir.

53:20.240 --> 53:21.798
Are those dots...

53:21.960 --> 53:23.109
They all must be aliens.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.155
What's that mass?

53:25.320 --> 53:26.799
Enlarge this section,
please.

53:28.280 --> 53:31.078
That's what our prisoner
alien meant by...

53:31.240 --> 53:32.753
"she is all."

53:32.960 --> 53:33.960
Director Levinson...

53:34.120 --> 53:35.120
I have Cheyenne Mountain

53:35.240 --> 53:36.616
and the remaining
world leaders online.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.056
David, what can you tell us?

53:38.080 --> 53:39.991
Ma'am, they're like
a hive and I think

53:40.120 --> 53:42.111
we just found their queen...

53:42.320 --> 53:43.435
their very big queen.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.272
This is an infrared image
of their ship...

53:45.440 --> 53:46.600
and we think that that's her,

53:46.680 --> 53:47.976
Madam President,
right there in the middle.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.194
Christ almighty.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.456
General Adams,
we have a live feed

53:50.480 --> 53:51.680
from
a reconnaissance aircraft.

53:52.120 --> 53:53.439
Great. Put it up.
Yes, sir.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.158
David, is this
one of their plasma drills

54:05.280 --> 54:06.349
you briefed us about?

54:06.840 --> 54:07.955
Yeah, I believe so.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.474
The funnel's over
a mile in diameter, sir.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.479
That's 20 times bigger
than the one in Africa.

54:17.160 --> 54:19.355
I think they're after
our molten core...

54:19.520 --> 54:21.556
which means
no magnetic fields...

54:21.800 --> 54:23.950
our atmosphere
would evaporate.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.872
Basically, the end of life
on this planet.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.951
Oh, so, you're saying
we're already finished.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.549
Not necessarily.

54:30.720 --> 54:33.837
Back in '96,
the drilling in Africa stopped

54:33.960 --> 54:35.393
when we blew up
their Mothership.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.136
There must have been
a queen up there

54:37.160 --> 54:38.309
that we didn't know about.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.176
Assuming that this
hive theory holds true...

54:40.200 --> 54:41.838
General, if we could
blow up this queen,

54:41.920 --> 54:43.512
maybe it could work again.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.511
All right,
then I'm authorizing

54:45.640 --> 54:47.517
an immediate
retaliatory strike.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.080
Let's do it.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.992
Scramble the fighters.
Right away.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.639
Attention, all pilots,

54:52.720 --> 54:54.870
report to mission briefing
in Tminus 10.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.156
I repeat, all pilots report to

54:57.240 --> 54:59.196
mission briefing
in Tminus 10.

55:01.200 --> 55:02.349
Hey.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.833
Come find me after the briefing,
okay?

55:43.760 --> 55:45.432
I'm so sorry, Dylan.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.951
I was right there, man.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.280
I just couldn't save her.
I was too late.

55:57.120 --> 55:58.519
I know I'm probably
the last person

55:58.600 --> 56:00.079
you want to hear
from right now...

56:02.240 --> 56:04.276
but I've been where you are.

56:05.600 --> 56:06.953
I know how deep it hurts.

56:11.800 --> 56:14.268
She wouldn't want you
to give up now.

56:15.240 --> 56:17.435
Come on, man.
You got to lead us.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.473
See you up there, Lieutenant.

56:40.800 --> 56:42.153
Good afternoon.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.316
This red mass
on the top of the ship...

56:45.480 --> 56:46.549
that's your target.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.776
We're gonna send
a fleet of drones

56:47.800 --> 56:48.800
to go in ahead of you...

56:48.840 --> 56:49.989
and disable their shields.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.275
Your mission...

56:51.840 --> 56:54.115
is to fly cover
for the bombers...

56:54.280 --> 56:56.794
who will be armed
with cold fusion warheads.

56:56.960 --> 56:59.315
Now, the blast should
penetrate the hull...

56:59.520 --> 57:01.636
and kill that alien queen.

57:01.800 --> 57:04.314
Captain Hiller will brief you
on the flight plan.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.873
We'll all try to converge
at the same time.

57:08.520 --> 57:10.511
But whoever
gets to the target first...

57:10.680 --> 57:11.829
will deliver the payload.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.188
We have to expect...

57:14.360 --> 57:17.989
that they're gonna come at us
with everything they got.

57:18.520 --> 57:20.875
So, protect the bombers
at all cost.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.914
We all lost someone
that we love.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.990
So, let's do it for them.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.240
Alpha strike launch
in one minute.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.160
Jake.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.752
I'm coming back.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.388
I promise you.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.552
Make them pay.

57:57.560 --> 57:59.440
We're not going up there
to make friends, right?

58:02.240 --> 58:03.559
I looked at the houses.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.838
The one on Harrison Street...

58:06.920 --> 58:08.069
with the stone walkway.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.353
If it's still there.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.751
Okay, it's getting real.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.070
It's getting real real.

58:20.920 --> 58:23.115
All right, form up. On me.

58:23.440 --> 58:25.271
It's the Fourth of July.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.755
So, let's show them
some fireworks.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.096
I want you to give me
one of your katana blades

59:04.120 --> 59:05.400
and teach me
everything you know.

59:07.320 --> 59:08.320
Fine.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.120
You know what?
I'll figure something out.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.279
What are you
idiots doing?

59:20.160 --> 59:22.469
Ah. The world's
going to end.

59:22.640 --> 59:24.312
Even worse,
we lost the gold.

59:24.440 --> 59:25.440
Mmm-hmm.

59:25.520 --> 59:27.158
So, we thought
we'd drink a little!

59:27.320 --> 59:28.639
The US Government
is on the line.

59:28.760 --> 59:29.776
They say
the aliens are drilling

59:29.800 --> 59:30.800
to the Earth's core...

59:30.960 --> 59:31.976
and they're looking for
a ship in the area

59:32.000 --> 59:33.040
to monitor their progress.

59:33.160 --> 59:34.513
We're the only ones left.

59:35.160 --> 59:36.354
Tell them we'll do it...

59:37.000 --> 59:38.513
for a hundred
million dollars.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.831
Look at this guy! Whee!

59:45.000 --> 59:46.274
Yeah, hold on one second.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
He's drunk.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.275
They said, "It's a deal."

59:55.480 --> 59:56.674
I got it. I got it.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.760
Look, Sam,
they're going off road.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.711
Maybe we should
do the same.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.234
Ouch!

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.837
Shit. What the hell
happened here?

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.314
We rescued you.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.674
Oh, thank you.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.514
Is this really you?

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.630
Of course it's me.
Who else would it be?

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.896
What's your son like?

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.016
Can you get us his autograph?

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.280
How often
do you see him?

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.839
These days
we only see each other

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.751
at Thanksgiving,
but unfortunately...

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.399
last year he had to cancel.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.558
What about you?

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.039
Where are your parents?

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:29.680
Um...

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.388
Visiting our grandparents
in Florida.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.193
Oh, I see.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.753
Where should we go,
Mr. Levinson?

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.556
I think the safest place
for all of us

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.989
to be right now
is by my David.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.120
Since you're the leading
expert on his condition,

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.559
I really wanted you
to see this.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.871
How can his connection
be so strong?

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.839
During the first attack...

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.951
he was exposed
to their collective mind.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.712
It was completely unfiltered.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.439
I need to ask him
about this.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.715
I already have.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.876
He doesn't even
remember drawing them.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.398
Okay, let's try
this baby on for size.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:07.600
You know, I helped bring
that thing back from space.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.234
Is there anything
I can do?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.356
Yeah. Back off.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.915
Yeah. Of course.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.759
Command, we have visual.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.776
Roger, Captain Hiller.
Continue approach.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.472
Mission is a go.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.629
Bay-18, sir.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.478
Why'd you put it
all the way up there?

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.160
Give me that.
Get the ladder down there.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.240
Come on!

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.430
Couldn't leave it on
a bottom shelf? Here we go.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.229
All right, coming for you,
baby. There she is.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.479
What is it?
An alien laser?

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.995
Nope.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.957
It's the Okun laser.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.478
Why aren't they attacking us?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.318
Careful what you wish for.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.152
There's the queen's ship.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280
Bombers, prepare to drop.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.151
You just had to jinx us!

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.589
Evade, evade!

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.359
Fire on command!

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.154
Two hostiles!

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.712
Squad, pull out.
Bank right.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.552
Maintain defensive posture.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.633
Down! Down! Down!

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.392
Protect the bombers!
Dive! Dive!

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.670
Command, the queen's ship
is too heavily defended.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.910
We have to regroup
and find a new approach.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
We have incoming.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.395
Damn, they're fast!

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.040
Jesus,
look at their firepower.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.038
Keep them
off the bombers.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.474
There's too many!

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.031
I got you now.
I got you, I got you.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:22.920
Whoa!

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.551
I can't shake them.
Son of a bitch!

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.872
Ah, come on. Help me out here.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I got you.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.231
Dylan, that's me, 12 o'clock.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.719
Ah, come on. Come on.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.880
Bank left!

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.389
Oh, God!

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.278
Whoo!
You can thank me later.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.793
Hell, I'll thank you
right now.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.914
We just lost bomber 9...

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.793
and bomber 13, sir.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.696
Command, we can't get
to the top of the ship.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.755
It's too heavily armed.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.433
We're dropping like flies
out here.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.560
Come on!

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.438
I think we need to fly inside.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.431
No, that's suicide. Sir?

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.955
Morrison's right.
This is our only shot.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160
Do it!

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.776
We'll detonate the bombs
from the Command Center...

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.736
and we'll give you enough time
to get the hell out of there.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.760
Copy that.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.950
Jake, follow my lead.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.155
I'm on your wing.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.790
All bombers,
we're going in.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.119
They didn't follow us.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.472
Form up on your leads.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.480
Charlie, look at
those fields down there.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.317
They have their own ecosystem.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.314
Sir?
Dad?

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.799
You have to warn them.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.835
She knows that
they're coming.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.309
We got eyes on the target.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.959
Tally-ho.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.438
That's what we came here for.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.835
All bombers,
open bomb bay doors.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.040
Get them out of there!

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.673
It's a trap.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.679
Come on. No!

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.032
Command,
I have engine failure.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.713
We have engine failure.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.839
Attempt to restart.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.310
We're going down,
we're going down!

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.350
I can't restart!

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.395
Come on!

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.193
We've lost all power!

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.520
Command, you have to
trigger the bombs!

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.234
It's the only way!

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.436
Don't let us die for nothing.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
Do it!

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.876
Madam President,
requesting authorization.

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.108
Permission granted.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.351
Detonation sequence initiated.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.517
Tell Patricia I love her.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.433
I love you, too.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560
In five...

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.955
four...

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.872
three, two...

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.393
one.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.552
That's a negative impact!

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.631
The bombs were contained
by an energy shield!

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.439
The bombs
were contained by an energy...

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.913
We lost the signal, sir.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.080
Wait.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.832
Something's happening.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.308
She baited us.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.632
Tanner, we have to have
a status report.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.280
We're trying.
Our satellites are down.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.469
We're completely blind.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.158
Madam President!

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.272
There will be no peace.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.274
Careful! You'll agitate
the crystals!

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.475
I built it back in '94.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:31.834
Had to shelve it,
though,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.877
after the meltdown
in sector three.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.837
Here, put her over here.
Brakish...

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.194
you're overexerting
yourself.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.518
What is that thing
doing here?

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.479
All right, be a good boy.
Go stand over there.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.518
Wait a second.
What meltdown?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.551
Are we sure this thing
is safe to use?

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.198
Highly unlikely.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.995
Clear!

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.176
What's the status
of the fleet?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.656
Only seven percent
made it back to base.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.680
Seven percent?
Yes, sir.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.238
General,
Cheyenne Mountain is gone.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.879
All members
of the presidential

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.671
line of succession
are presumed dead.

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.000
They're here to
swear you in, sir.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720
Attention to orders!

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.314
Please repeat after me.

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:24.392
I, Joshua T. Adams.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.028
Do solemnly swear.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.031
I'm so sorry.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.273
You were right.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.231
We're not gonna
beat them this time.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.634
God, look at the line.
There's a thousand cars.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.431
We're never
gonna get gas.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.349
Have a little faith.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.591
You wanna talk about faith?

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.953
My parents are probably
dead right now...

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.348
and most of my friends.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.616
She's just upset because
her boyfriend, Kyle,

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.640
is for sure a goner.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:13.632
What's a goner?

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800
Someone who's dead.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.960
Felix!

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.274
Why don't you pull over here?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.080
Let me drive
and you take a little break.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.468
Okay.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.920
Not many.
I'm gonna try to get

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.234
what I can and salvage these.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.472
David, you should be
in the Command Center.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.594
President Whitmore.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.478
Thank God you're okay.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.392
It's been a while.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.955
I had 20 years
to get us ready.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.915
And we never had a chance.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.071
We didn't
last time either.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.389
We always knew
they were coming back.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.673
But look how far we've come.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.318
In the last 20 years...

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.080
this planet has been
unified in a way

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.151
that's unprecedented
in human history.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.432
That's sacred.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.592
That's worth fighting for.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.752
We convinced
an entire generation

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.149
that this is a battle
that we could win...

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.670
and they believed us.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.794
We can't let them down.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.829
And it wasn't
luck last time.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.471
It was our resolve.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.797
We all have to fight...

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.712
till our last breath.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.349
And that is gonna
lead us to victory.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:43.872
You understand
some of their language.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.952
I'd like you to tell me
if any of these writings

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.393
mean anything to you.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.509
So, okay,
how about this one?

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.632
This talks about
an intergalactic war.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.391
This concerns
the whole universe.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.238
What about this one?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.832
Something about an enemy.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:11.358
It needs to be destroyed
before it gets to us.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920
Wait.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.310
I had a case study
in Brazil...

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:18.870
where my patient
didn't describe the circle...

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.034
as "fear."
He referred to it...

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440
as "enemy."

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.274
Of course.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.429
Their enemy is our ally.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.553
Um, your laser's
smoking.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.275
Uh-oh.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.509
Get it outta here.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.591
Tell 'em to try
to pull it open.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.078
Hello, gorgeous.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.634
Time to find out
what secrets you're hiding.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.616
All right,
let's go get everyone.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640
Bring them here.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720
Yes, sir.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.080
Watch your back!

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.475
Scorpio!

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.560
Come on, they're
picking us up! Move!

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.913
Jake, get out of the way!

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.749
Guys...

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.518
you really need
to see this.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.033
I've run every
possible scan.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.656
It's not giving off
any kind of signal.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.159
I mean, nothing.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.560
It's like
it doesn't even exist.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.517
It's almost like it's
trying to hide itself.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.839
It's really smooth.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.991
Hey, whoa!
You're not wearing gloves!

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.040
You'll contaminate it.
Remove your hands, Floyd.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.391
That's weird. I can't.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.710
What do you mean
you can't? Rosenberg.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.235
Okay, I'm trapped.
Somebody do something.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.469
It's swallowing me!

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.834
Just stay calm
and don't panic.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.160
This thing
is trying to eat me,

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.719
and your advice
is not to panic!

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.717
Looks like
they're mobilizing.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.474
David, please tell me

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.471
this isn't some kind of
a Trojan horse.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.390
I don't think
it's a danger to us.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.118
But it must be to them.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.391
He turned it on
just by touching it.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.754
I activated myself...

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.235
when I detected
your biological signature...

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.152
to be different from theirs.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.673
It speaks!

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.273
In English!

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:25.432
I deconstructed
your primitive language.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.073
We're primitive?

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.755
Correct. My species shed
our biological existence...

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.150
for a virtual one
thousands of years ago.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.520
Far out.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.999
Why are you here?

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.958
When I intercepted
their distress call...

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.839
I knew they would come
to exterminate you.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.834
I came to evacuate
as many of you as possible.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.194
But you attacked me

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:49.993
with the same weapons
they used on us.

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.349
They attacked you?

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.669
Correct.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.354
A Harvester Ship
conquered our planet...

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.988
and extracted
its molten core.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.594
They use them
to refuel their ships...

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.439
and grow their technology.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.160
They have done this
to countless civilizations.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:09.519
We fought them
for thousands of years...

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.955
but they destroyed
all of our ships.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.635
I am the sole survivor.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.712
I am so sorry
to hear that.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.109
Do you have a plan?

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.873
My system holds the key
to superior technology.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.399
And there is
a hidden planet...

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.552
where I teach refugees
from other fallen worlds...

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.518
how to build weapons that will
defeat them...

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.079
once and for all.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.016
That's why
they're afraid of you.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.191
You're the only ones
who threaten their existence.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360
Correct.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.630
But now that I am activated...

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:42.513
the queen will detect
my signature...

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.914
and hunt me down.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.399
It's too late.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.311
She's already on her way.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.833
Yeah.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.149
She's coming.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.032
Hey, what would happen...

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.751
if we were able to kill her?

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.595
No one has ever killed
a Harvester queen.

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.068
That's encouraging.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.280
But as a hive...

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.839
her fighters will fall,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.831
and her ship
will leave your planet.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.673
Recalled by
other Harvester queens.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.353
But it's too late now.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.748
You must terminate me...

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.672
or she will get
the coordinates

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.273
to the refugee planet.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.078
And that will be the end.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.355
Wait, wait a second.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.795
If we're so sure that she's
coming here to get you...

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.671
maybe we can bait her...

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.276
like she baited us.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.953
Mr. President,
Dr. Okun thinks...

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.709
that we can replicate

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.096
the Sphere's
RF radiation signal...

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.189
David, English,
please.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.476
Every computer has a
radioactive signature...

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.393
whether it's your laptop,
your phone, even your watch.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.391
But the Sphere
has an RFR

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.760
that's completely
off the charts.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.309
So, if we hide
the real Sphere...

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.311
inside the isolation
chamber...

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.776
and pack
this decoy transmitter,

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.800
so to speak...

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.474
onto a tug filled with
cold fusion bombs...

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.596
and lure her
out to the salt flats...

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.116
We can fly it right up her
royal ass and bon voyage!

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.392
You set off
cold fusion bombs...

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:04.154
you're gonna kill everyone
from here to Houston.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.992
Not if we use
the shield generators

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.480
from this base
to contain the blast.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.072
Without our shields,
you better put

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.673
a blaster in every
able bodied hand...

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.115
and get them ready
to shoot some aliens.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.508
Yes, sir.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.591
Now, we just need a way
to see her coming.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.838
Follow me.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.160
Do your thing.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.918
My thing?
Do my thing? My thing!

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.474
Take it off!

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.119
Copy, sir.
Watch it.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.679
This old radar truck

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.791
was supposed to go
to the Smithsonian.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.675
They never picked it up.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.512
It's a good thing they didn't.

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.416
Yeah, drive it
to the highest point.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440
The higher, the better.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520
Yes, sir.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.599
Look what I found
in the hold.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.791
We should be able to
communicate with this.

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:51.480
Let's hook up the antenna.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.194
What was that?

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.630
The drill is
cracking the outer mantle...

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.360
but that shouldn't happen
for another...

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.195
We were wrong.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.709
We do not have seven hours
until the Earth core breach.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.108
We only have...

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.549
one.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.629
Call it in.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.630
Area 51, do you copy?

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.839
So, the idea...

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.468
is to get her
to follow this tug...

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.671
into the salt flats...

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.912
using the decoy transmitter
on board.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.514
And once
she's taken the bait...

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.671
our cold fusion bombs
can go to town.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.152
It's a Hail Mary!

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.589
But it can work.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.353
There's a catch.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.336
As you know, they took out
all of our satellites...

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:51.032
which means that somebody...

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.192
is gonna have to
fly it in manually.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.509
And I know that I'm asking

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.511
for the ultimate sacrifice.
I know that.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.080
But you...

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.390
you are the only pilots
we have left.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.037
And I need a volunteer.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.679
Let's get it done.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.074
I'll fly it in.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.440
No, you won't.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.599
I'll do it.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.074
Mr. President.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.712
Dad, what are you doing?

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800
Patty.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.633
There are a lot of reasons why
I'm the best choice for this.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.313
You all have to pick up
the pieces once it's over.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.473
This is my part.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720
Matthew...

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.116
do not let him
get on that tug.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.710
Do you understand me?

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.119
Get the hell
off the road!

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.748
If we go any slower,
we'll be going backwards.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.275
Don't be a shmuck.
We have to conserve gas.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.834
Area 51
is still 75 miles away.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.956
We're running on fumes.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.792
What do we have here?

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.475
Who's in charge here?

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.755
No one.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.434
Our driver left us
to take a ride to Minnesota.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.113
Just like that?
He just left?

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.350
He went to go have sex
with his girlfriend.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.876
Yes! All aboard!

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:38.270
Wait! What about
our car?

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.096
We'll get a new one
when you get your license.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.348
On the bus, everybody!

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.392
Tell the General
we're up and running.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.114
Bring it in.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.389
Spin it around.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.120
All right, plug it in.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.238
Radar is operational, sir.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.719
Son of a bitch.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.189
All right, they're
coming in fast. David...

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.078
we got a real fire storm
coming our way

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.480
and not a lot of time
to prepare.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.073
Give me numbers,
Mr. President.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.000
Nine minutes to
the queen's ship's arrival...

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.311
roughly 22 minutes before the
drill reaches our molten core.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.357
Jesus Christ.
Take your positions.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.919
We don't have
a second to lose.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.475
Are we gonna make it, sir?

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.753
You bet your ass we will.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.399
All right,
here we go, men.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.192
Get up on that barricade.

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.069
Prepare to fire!

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.913
This thing is way cooler
than a machete!

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.752
Sorry! Sorry,
everyone!

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.069
That was my bad!

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:51.756
I'm gonna see
if it's clear.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.513
Jake!

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.194
Hell of a time
to scare a guy!

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280
Sorry.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.440
Oh, it's good
to see you!

01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.560
It's good to
see you, too.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:01.352
I didn't think you made it.
Why not?

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.800
You haven't flown a fighter
in a while, so I figured...

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.240
You're alive,
that's what counts.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.068
Enough with the reunion.
They're gonna hear us.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:12.309
More of us made it!

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.560
You're still talking loud.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.989
So, what now?
Go in guns blazing?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.638
Hey, what are you doing?

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.081
You guys get to those fighters
and don't leave me hanging.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160
Wait!

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.593
Excuse me!

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.309
Down here!

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.235
There you go.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.871
Listen, I usually
don't hold a grudge...

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.952
but you killed my parents.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.473
So...

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.710
I'm gonna make an exception
for you guys.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.120
Charlie, Rain...

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.440
you two
take the first fighter.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.431
Been holding that one
for a while.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.040
Their technology
hasn't changed at all!

01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.080
Get the weapons ready.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.355
Whoo!

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.589
New interface.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.040
Shit.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.357
Jake's in trouble! Let's go!

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.037
Getting a little
low there, Rain.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.320
Nice!

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:34.156
Oh, no, you don't!

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.120
Should've kept running.
Get your ass out of there!

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:40.676
Take this!

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.512
Oh, man. Yeah.
Hey, thanks for that.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:45.953
Get up there
where you belong.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.120
What, you don't
want to fly?

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280
Hell, no. I wanna shoot.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.234
All pilots, go to
channel six on your radios.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.719
Anytime, gentlemen.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.155
You guys go ahead.
We'll cover the rear.

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.074
Big closing doors!

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.151
Big closing doors! Jake!

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.233
Where are you?

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.436
We're on our way!
Rain, how long we got?

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.868
20 seconds, max.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.758
No, Rain, stop! Bank left!

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.113
We have to go!

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.998
No! We're not leaving
anyone else behind!

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.638
No one else dies today!

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.028
You with me?

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.748
I'm with you.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.434
It's getting dicey up here!

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.158
Rain, just get out of here!

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.072
Respectfully, sir,
no way in hell!

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.680
- Come on!
- Hey, man...

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.478
I just want you to know...

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.756
if we don't make it
out of here...

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.990
I'm really sorry for almost
killing you in training.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.136
If we don't make it
out of here,

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.200
I just want you to know...

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.280
I'm not sorry at all about
punching you in the face.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.554
Hey, way to go, Charlie!

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.640
Whoo!

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.920
All right, we're clear.
You lead, we follow.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.795
Faster, Rain!

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.960
Faster!

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.828
Hang on to your seat, buddy!

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:22.069
Jake, did you make it?

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.108
Rain...

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.714
did you see him
come out of there?

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.954
I'm not sure.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:32.708
Jake?

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:34.640
Did you miss me?

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:39.432
You can't do that to me.

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.074
I told you
you'd get lonely without me.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.591
All right, aviators,
let's turn and burn.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.797
Clock's ticking,
we gotta get out of here.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.872
Stand by for a broadcast

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.076
from the United States
government.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.496
I understand that many
people around the world...

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.432
are tuning into this channel
on their shortwave radios.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.549
To you out there
and here at home...

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.278
make no mistake,
this is humanity's last stand.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.952
What we do
in the next 12 minutes...

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.793
will either define
the human race or finish it.

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.071
To those of you listening...

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:20.710
no matter your nationality,
color or creed...

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.675
I ask that
all of you pray for us.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.430
No matter our differences,
we are all one people.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.597
Whatever happens...

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.591
succeed or fail...

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:35.311
we will face it together...

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.392
standing as one.

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.696
Decoy mission launch,

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.789
T-minus 60 seconds.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.194
Patricia!

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400
Patricia!

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:48.834
What is it?
It's your dad.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.638
He collapsed.
Come with me quick.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.760
Mission is fueled,

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.558
loaded and ready for launch.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.320
Where is he?

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.715
He asked me as a friend.
As a father.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Dad!

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.118
Decoy convoy...

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:21.793
hold and ready position.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.237
It says here, you got to
fly on Air Force One.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.400
You meet the president?

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.357
My dad says your son
never went to space...

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.748
and it's just
a conspiracy.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920
Oh, yeah?

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.759
Your father's a putz.

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.120
Wait.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.513
Do you hear that?

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.856
What, the kid
making fun of me?

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.199
No. That sound.

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.235
Oh, boy.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.190
Kids, hold on
to your seats!

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840
They're inbound.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.435
10 seconds till contact.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:05.633
They're gonna target
the cannon first.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.119
We won't get
too many shots off,

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.428
so you just make
them count.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.909
On my command...

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.560
fire!

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.794
I have to take this fighter.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.256
We're still priming
the fusion drive.

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.349
It's only at 32%.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.280
That's more than enough.
Give me the harness.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.358
General,
we're up and running.

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.160
All right, Tom,
we are ready to go.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.350
Activate the decoy transmitter
on my mark.

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.511
Three... two...

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.600
one.

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:01.752
Isolation chamber activated.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.319
The convoy is a go.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:06.034
Give them cover fire. Now.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.596
Now, Tom, now.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:21.880
It's working.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.389
She's following the decoy.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.913
Wait, what
are you doing?

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.553
It doesn't matter.
We're isolated.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.868
I'm gonna turn it
back on.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.136
Why would you do that?

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.673
To see what else
this thing knows.

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:35.113
Excuse me, just have a few questions,
if you don't mind.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.872
Sir, there's
a school bus

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.279
headed directly
towards the trap.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.360
No, no, no.

01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.034
David, the queen's ship
will be there in two minutes.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.592
Who is that? No, no, no!

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.031
There's a tall, dangling man
waving us down over there.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.235
Tall, dangling?

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:53.839
That's my David!

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.312
Who is this blind idiot?

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:58.630
Yeah! Yes, thank you.

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.708
Dad?

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.908
This is going to
catapult our civilization...

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.479
by thousands of years.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.392
Our understanding
of physics...

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.391
wormholes, everything,
everything!

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.039
Hey, calm down.
Calm down!

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.394
I don't want to
calm down!

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.438
Ah! David!

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.400
What, we have to wait
for the end of the world

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.589
for us to get together?

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.680
Come, David!

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.956
I'm so happy you're alive,
but I'm busy right now.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.576
You'll be happy to know
I made some acquaintances.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.635
They came to see you.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.279
I'm a little busy
right now, Dad.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.616
You and I,
we're gonna have to talk.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.868
I said not now! Look!

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.075
Yeah, I see...

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.096
Tom, it looks like
the plan is working.

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.599
She thinks
you've got the Sphere.

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.016
She's only going after
the fighters.

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.640
We gotta get these kids
to cover. Go, go!

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:01.076
It's good to see you
flying again.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.758
Your place is in the air.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.159
You should've let me do this.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.916
You saved the world
once before, Dad.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.312
I'm not saving
the world, Patty.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:15.593
I'm saving you.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.235
T om, what's going on?

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.515
She's in my head.

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.429
Mr. President...

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.120
you've got incoming fighters
on your 6.

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.671
Can you get me to the target,
Lt. Whitmore?

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.432
Yes, sir. Follow me.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.195
Come on.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.440
Go now!

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.671
Now, now!
Activate the shield!

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.637
Shield engaged.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.637
Lt. Whitmore,
clear the blast zone.

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.432
Surprised to see me?

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.875
Do it. Push the button, Tom.
Do it, Tom.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.154
That's right. We got you.

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:17.317
On behalf of
the planet Earth...

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.993
Happy Fourth of July.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.469
Do we have confirmation,
David?

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.516
I think it's safe to say,
Mr. President...

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.114
that we got her!

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.759
Yes!

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.714
Wait, if she's dead,

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.711
why are her fighters
still attacking us?

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.513
Command, we have a breach!

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.216
How many do you think?
About two dozen, sir.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.240
Under no circumstances...

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.919
do they see the Sphere.

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:30.469
You do whatever it takes.
Do you copy?

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:31.640
Copy that.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.989
This is Sam.
My navigator.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.037
Um... You're a lot taller
than I imagined.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.896
This is her sister, Daisy.

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.148
Um, sir...
There's Bobby.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.436
Is that supposed
to happen?

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.318
Not good.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:52.108
Oh, my God.

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.474
She has her own shield.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.715
What is that?

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.560
Okay, back in the bus, kids.
Back on the bus.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.840
Let's go. Get back
on the bus!

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:04.835
Get her!

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.354
Ginger!

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.754
Where are you going?
No, no, no!

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.398
Come on, girl! Let's go!

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.536
We have to wait for
the dog? I guess so.

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:12.560
Hurry, Sam! Come on!

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:13.960
- Come on!
- Get in here, girl!

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.433
Come back!

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.672
- Okay. Close the door.
- Oh, shit.

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.594
Oh, my God!

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.680
Drive!

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.656
All remaining pilots,

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.715
target the queen.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.353
Unload everything you've got!

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.598
Did you hear that?

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.551
We need back up
down here, now.

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:52.439
We've got a serious breach
in cell block five.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.480
We got aliens on the loose.
We need back up now!

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.232
Hey! Where are you going?

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.196
Oh, my God!
Where'd she go?

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.316
Sir, that thing
just leapt into the air!

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.152
What'd he say?
Something about jumping.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.875
Look out!

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:17.960
Whoa! Whoa!

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.038
We are within
six minutes, sir.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.519
David, six minutes
to Earth's core breach.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.396
General Adams,
her shield is down!

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.278
Yes!
I repeat, her shield is down.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.509
Great job, Lieutenant.

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.751
I got you, baby!

01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.477
We're gonna
get you out of this.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.313
Aim for her gun, Charlie.
Aim for her gun.

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.074
This is Captain Hiller.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.576
We've hijacked
a couple of alien fighters.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.600
Yes!
Yes!

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.760
Do not shoot at us!

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.120
We're the ones trailing smoke.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.753
Roger that,
Captain Hiller.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.069
Go on, get her!

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.559
Shoot her down!

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.911
Whitmore
destroyed the queen's ship

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.991
and his daughter
knocked out her shield.

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.196
Now, listen up! They're going
for our molten core.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:33.794
You've got 4 minutes...

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:36.155
to destroy the queen.
So give her hell.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.949
Copy that. No pressure.

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.831
We're really running
into an alien prison.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.314
This is the one!

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.357
Open up!
We're here!

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.635
She knows!

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.272
She's coming!

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.029
Dylan, what's happening?

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.200
I don't know. My controls
just stopped responding.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.040
Same here.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.912
- Charlie, do something!
- I can't!

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.736
She must have taken control
of our systems.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.830
I think we're part of
the hive now.

01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.317
Looks like
we're not the only ones.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:40.960
The hell?

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.951
She's taking us
straight to Area 51.

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:50.880
What are you doing?

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.016
You're not going to
follow her!

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.256
Stay behind the yellow line,
please, Dad.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:55.157
There is no yellow line.
Imagine one!

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.440
Take that!

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.520
See?

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.552
Told you
I'd figure it out.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.793
You talk too much.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.270
Baby, we're saved!

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.115
They got me.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.399
Oh, no.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.120
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you to sick bay.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.078
Don't worry.
I'm not going to make it.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:45.599
Wait a minute. Wait.

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.159
You can't go.

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.078
Who's gonna water
the orchids?

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.549
Who's gonna make sure

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.080
you put your pants on
in the morning?

01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.029
Right.

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:58.429
I've got something
I gotta tell you.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:41:59.880
What?

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.795
This!

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.155
That was supposed
to be a sweater.

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360
Oh, no, no.

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.758
No. Oh, no.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.072
What the hell
is she doing?

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.392
That's close
enough, David.

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:47.600
I think they're trying
to protect her.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.078
More are coming.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.280
Give me that thing.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.475
Take that.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:02.800
Two minutes, sir.

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.399
Two minutes until core breach.

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:06.516
Captain Hiller,
you've got two minutes.

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.829
Two minutes.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.036
Man, we gotta
get out of this tornado.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.720
Every tornado
has an eye, right?

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.136
I think if we want to
get a shot at her,

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.195
we gotta get up there.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.456
But how are we
gonna do that?

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.038
We don't have
any manual controls left.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.160
Don't these things have
fusion drive or something?

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.320
Are you kidding me?

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.476
That thing is made
for outer space.

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.834
Down here, we'll burn up.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.399
You got a better idea,
Charlie?

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.879
Because from
where I'm sitting...

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.576
it looks like
it's our only damn chance.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.749
Our only chance to die.

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.840
Charlie, shut up!

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:33.074
Rain, arm the thrusters.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.393
- You're all crazy!
- One...

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.749
two, three!

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.837
Still alive.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.911
You all right?
Whoo! Man!

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.798
I got the controls back.

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.280
And our weapons
are working!

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.237
Yeah,
but our engines are fried.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.039
All right. It's gotta be
a controlled dive, then.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.674
There she is!

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:24.918
Everybody,
we got one shot at this.

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.310
Let's make it count.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.671
Thanks for always looking out
for me, Jake.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.152
You got it, buddy.

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.673
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.353
It's over.
You got 'em all.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:42.440
Okay.

01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.719
Except that one.

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.472
Oh, my God.
She's got it.

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.796
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.796
Get ready for
a close encounter, bitch!

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.600
Charlie!

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.136
Go for her back
right where the tentacles are!

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.160
That's her weak spot.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.278
Yoo-hoo!

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.200
Keep shooting, Charlie!

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:37.159
What do you think
I'm doing?

01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.432
Shit!

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.552
This thing got ejection seats?

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.199
Negative.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.600
Look out!

01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:59.110
I told you not to get
too close, David!

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.111
David, let's get out of here!

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.593
Back up. Go back!

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.035
We're alive!

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.475
We're rich!

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:43.471
Oh, my God.

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.309
General Adams...

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.990
the Earth's core is secure.

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:53.519
Whoa! Look at that!

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.719
She's dead. We got her.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.192
Baby, put the gun down.

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.429
Jake?

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.275
Jake!

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.560
We're not even
married yet,

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.920
you're already trying
to shoot me?

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:58.515
Maybe we should try that.

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:01.800
You know.

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.080
Dinner, first!

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.440
Oh...

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.238
Director Levinson.

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:15.160
Well done.

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.234
Thank you,
Mr. President.

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.229
Good job.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.400
Catherine...

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:21.560
Um...

01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:24.234
Don't say anything.
You'll just ruin it.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.509
Who are you?

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:30.319
David never mentioned a
beautiful woman in his life.

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:31.555
Dad!

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:33.517
I'm Julius.
I'm his father.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.109
Enchantée.
I'm Catherine Marceaux.

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.514
Could you give us
a second?

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.749
I was never here.

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:43.598
Listen, maybe you guys should
stay with me for a while...

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.872
I think that
we'd really like that.

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:47.629
Yeah, so would I.

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.193
Are you okay?

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.715
I am. Thanks to you.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.956
This wasn't all for nothing.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.270
You are a remarkable species.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.476
Not so primitive
after all, huh?

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.240
You think they'll let me
keep this thing?

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.316
You have the heart
of a warrior.

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.158
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.077
Hell of a job.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.631
We are rich! We are rich!

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:52.114
We are rich! We're wealthy!

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:10.195
I don't know if this planet
could survive another attack.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:13.072
Excuse me,
Director Levinson...

01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:14.958
you won't believe...

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.439
the weapons
and the technology...

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:19.797
this thing has on its
proverbial hard drive.

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:22.474
It wants us
to lead their resistance!

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:23.640
What do you mean?

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:24.760
Two words...

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.151
interstellar travel.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.149
Take the fight to them.

01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.673
When do we leave?

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:35.512
We are gonna kick
some serious alien ass.
