- Hey, guys.
- Hi, everybody.

02:26.575 --> 02:28.074
All: - Hi.
- We're here today

02:28.127 --> 02:31.194
at the beautiful
and historic Culver Studios lot,

02:31.230 --> 02:34.798
where countless projects have
filmed for nearly a century,

02:34.833 --> 02:36.700
<i>including Gone With The Wind,</i>

02:36.735 --> 02:38.101
<i>Citizen Kane,</i>

All right, are you guys
ready to find out about

02:41.140 --> 02:42.839
your next Spotlight Challenge?

02:42.841 --> 02:43.974
All: Yes!

02:43.976 --> 02:46.176
Good, cause this is a fun one.

02:46.211 --> 02:49.646
Now, whether you wish upon
a star or wave your magic wand,

02:49.648 --> 02:50.981
Hollywood has a long history

02:51.033 --> 02:53.817
of breathing life
into inanimate objects.

02:53.869 --> 02:58.121
Films and television shows
like Pinocchio, Toy Story,

02:58.157 --> 02:59.689
<i>and Pee-Wee's Playhouse</i>

02:59.725 --> 03:03.660
showed audiences the magic
in everyday objects.

03:03.695 --> 03:07.430
And today, it'll be up to you
to provide that magic.

03:07.483 --> 03:10.000
- [laughter, chatter]
- That's awesome.

03:10.002 --> 03:11.835
For this week's
Spotlight Challenge,

03:11.870 --> 03:13.837
you will be working in teams

03:13.839 --> 03:17.090
to create a wacky,
larger-than-life character

03:17.125 --> 03:20.544
inspired by one of these
inanimate objects.

03:20.579 --> 03:22.779
- All right.
<i>- I'm really excited.</i>

03:22.831 --> 03:24.731
I don't normally
do whimsical makeups.

03:24.783 --> 03:26.616
It's something
I've always wanted to do,

03:26.618 --> 03:28.652
so I can't wait to get started.

03:28.704 --> 03:29.986
Now, your teams
have been randomly assigned,

03:30.038 --> 03:31.988
so when Ve calls out your name,

03:32.040 --> 03:33.890
go ahead and stand
with your new teammate.

03:33.942 --> 03:38.195
Team number one
is Walter and Ant.

03:38.230 --> 03:41.064
Njoroge and Jennifer.

03:41.099 --> 03:42.766
Anna and Mel.

03:42.768 --> 03:44.501
Yes.

03:44.536 --> 03:47.404
- Robert and Yvonne.
- All right.

03:47.406 --> 03:49.472
Rob and Johnny.

03:49.525 --> 03:51.107
Katie and Kaleb.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.809
Hey.
[giggles]

03:52.861 --> 03:55.946
Melissa, don't think
we forgot about you.

03:55.981 --> 03:58.982
As the winner of last week's
Spotlight Challenge,

03:58.984 --> 04:01.835
you get to choose
which team you want to be on.

04:01.887 --> 04:04.888
Um, I think I'll be
with Rob and Johnny.

04:04.890 --> 04:06.489
All right, go ahead
and join your new team.

04:06.525 --> 04:07.924
Okay.

04:07.926 --> 04:09.476
Being on a team of three

04:09.511 --> 04:11.611
is supposed to be a reward
for winning the last challenge.

04:11.663 --> 04:13.113
But it's very intimidating,

04:13.165 --> 04:14.915
'cause we know we're gonna
have to really step it up,

04:14.950 --> 04:16.899
'cause we have three people
working on everything.

04:16.902 --> 04:19.903
Now, Ve, you worked on
a very whimsical show

04:19.954 --> 04:22.539
once upon a time...
Pee-Wee's Playhouse.

04:22.574 --> 04:24.774
- Yeah.
- You even won an Emmy for it.

04:24.826 --> 04:26.876
All right, so what can you
tell these guys to help them

04:26.878 --> 04:30.764
capture the colorful,
wacky spirit of this challenge?

04:30.799 --> 04:32.766
I really want you guys
to think out of the box.

04:32.801 --> 04:34.017
Just go crazy.

04:34.052 --> 04:35.218
Bring out your inner child.

04:35.270 --> 04:37.921
Make it colorful, psychedelic.

04:37.956 --> 04:40.924
And please,
do not go to the dark place.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.826
[laughter]

04:42.861 --> 04:45.862
All right, guys, when Ve
says "Go," you can all come over

04:45.864 --> 04:48.632
and choose the object
you want to use for inspiration.

04:48.667 --> 04:49.866
And when you've got something,

04:49.868 --> 04:52.535
go ahead and start
working on your designs.

04:52.588 --> 04:53.803
I'll swing by the lab later on
with my dad

04:53.839 --> 04:55.705
to check in and see
how you're doing.

04:55.741 --> 04:59.876
Okay, guys,
get on your marks, get set,

04:59.911 --> 05:01.011
go!

05:02.931 --> 05:05.148
Clock! Clock! Clock!
[laughing]

05:09.454 --> 05:10.687
Is there a color we're doing?

05:10.722 --> 05:12.055
What do you think about yellow?

05:12.107 --> 05:13.523
- Why do yellow?
- 'Cause it's supposed to be,

05:13.558 --> 05:16.209
like, a happy...
a happy color, right?

05:16.244 --> 05:17.694
Njoroge and I select crayons,

05:17.729 --> 05:19.763
and our concept is a crayon man

05:19.798 --> 05:22.732
<i>that came to life
out of the crayon box.</i>

05:22.784 --> 05:26.586
And then we're going
to make crayon fingers for him.

05:26.638 --> 05:29.172
It's gonna be a... a step
out of what I usually do,

05:29.174 --> 05:32.175
because I'm mostly, like,
sci-fi and creature stuff...

05:32.227 --> 05:33.677
like, more realistic things.

05:33.729 --> 05:35.762
But this one,
it's just gonna be so much fun.

05:39.084 --> 05:41.251
Katie and I chose the key,

05:41.286 --> 05:45.522
but we don't want to turn
a person into an actual key.

05:45.557 --> 05:50.527
So our concept is a well-loved
older porcelain ballerina doll

05:50.562 --> 05:54.431
that unlocks imagination
and creativity and love.

05:54.466 --> 05:55.965
What about more champagnes

05:55.967 --> 05:57.384
- and silvers?
- Yes.

05:57.436 --> 06:00.003
We want to go with
the approach of a skeleton key.

06:00.005 --> 06:01.338
<i>They have that beautiful
design work,</i>

06:01.340 --> 06:04.240
and we want to organically
incorporate the key

06:04.292 --> 06:05.709
with our character.

06:05.744 --> 06:08.345
- I'm feeling good about this.
- I feel pretty good too.

06:12.184 --> 06:13.883
This can be like a breastplate.

06:13.885 --> 06:15.435
Mm-hmm.

06:15.470 --> 06:18.104
For the numbers, I'm thinking
all over his costume.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.557
<i>Anna and I have the watch.</i>

06:20.592 --> 06:22.859
We're having trouble convincing
each other of our ideas,

06:22.861 --> 06:25.395
<i>and we're having trouble
nailing down a concept</i>

06:25.447 --> 06:27.530
that isn't so on the nose.

06:27.582 --> 06:29.833
If you're not,
like, into this, like, please,

06:29.868 --> 06:33.069
by all means... are you liking
where this is headed?

06:33.105 --> 06:35.638
I'm... I'm feeling
a little nervous right now.

06:35.674 --> 06:37.924
I'm hoping Anna and I can come
to some sort of resolution

06:37.976 --> 06:39.509
before we get back to the lab.

06:45.450 --> 06:49.018
<i>For our dice character,
Robert and I think game board.</i>

06:49.020 --> 06:50.437
Robert comes up with the idea

06:50.489 --> 06:52.522
for the playing piece
for on top of the head,

06:52.557 --> 06:56.159
<i>and that's where we start going
with the design.</i>

06:56.194 --> 07:01.998
- It's board... Board Game Man.
- Board Game Man, yeah.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.851
I will use red and white,

07:04.886 --> 07:06.803
and then maybe blue and yellow

07:06.805 --> 07:10.106
so I have it really colorful
for the children.

07:10.108 --> 07:12.509
Hey, everybody,
let's go back to the lab.

07:24.556 --> 07:26.172
Walter and I pick the race car.

07:26.208 --> 07:28.458
We want to create something
that a child would look at

07:28.510 --> 07:30.960
and want to be or want to own.

07:30.962 --> 07:32.929
<i>Walter's gonna start
sculpting the chest piece,</i>

07:32.964 --> 07:34.664
<i>and I'm gonna start
sculpting the cowl.</i>

07:34.666 --> 07:37.100
<i>We're gonna be creating
this super-cool,</i>

07:37.135 --> 07:39.436
<i>fast car-human hybrid...</i>

07:39.471 --> 07:41.571
like a feminine, cool hot rod.

07:41.573 --> 07:43.239
<i>We're taking a little bit
of a risk,</i>

07:43.291 --> 07:45.074
<i>'cause we're not putting
any prosthetics on the face,</i>

07:45.127 --> 07:47.811
but I feel really confident
in my beauty-makeup skills.

07:47.846 --> 07:50.063
<i>And keeping our face human
helps our concept,</i>

07:50.098 --> 07:53.049
because it shows that
it's a half human, half car.

07:57.906 --> 08:00.623
Our concept is,
there's this child,

08:00.625 --> 08:03.293
and his father
runs a candy store.

08:03.345 --> 08:05.462
<i>And he realizes
that he's going to have to</i>

08:05.464 --> 08:06.863
<i>take over his father's shop.</i>

08:06.898 --> 08:09.766
<i>So he dreams up this character,
this Lollipop King,</i>

08:09.801 --> 08:11.868
<i>who's the leader
of all the other candies</i>

08:11.903 --> 08:13.670
<i>who's going
to help him run the store.</i>

08:13.705 --> 08:15.538
<i>Rob gets to work right away
sculpting the cowl,</i>

08:15.574 --> 08:16.906
<i>Johnny takes the face,</i>

08:16.942 --> 08:19.776
<i>and I start to sketch
a pattern for the vest.</i>

08:22.481 --> 08:24.314
Yeah, yeah, or culty,
or anything like that.

08:24.366 --> 08:25.815
Do you have any thoughts
on that?

08:25.867 --> 08:27.484
I mean, that was everything
I would've said.

08:27.486 --> 08:28.751
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:33.558 --> 08:35.491
<i>Yvonne is making the face,</i>

08:35.527 --> 08:36.926
<i>and I'm doing the cowl.</i>

08:36.962 --> 08:41.097
We start to grow a bit
apart in the ideas.

08:41.131 --> 08:44.467
I want to show you the nose
on this one.

08:44.469 --> 08:46.519
Oh, you want it, like, huge.

08:46.555 --> 08:47.971
I think that's way too big.

08:48.023 --> 08:50.757
I want to go all exaggerated

08:50.809 --> 08:53.927
and over the top,
and she doesn't like it.

08:53.979 --> 08:56.513
<i>She's my partner,
so we have to be political.</i>

08:56.565 --> 08:59.382
But I think,
I go crazy on the hat.

08:59.417 --> 09:00.917
<i>Maybe if she goes more normal
on the face,</i>

09:00.919 --> 09:02.168
<i>maybe it kind of blends together</i>

09:02.220 --> 09:03.736
<i>so it's like a balance.</i>

09:03.772 --> 09:05.822
<i>Who knows?</i>

09:05.857 --> 09:09.659
<i>[exciting music]</i>

09:09.661 --> 09:12.962
<i>Jenn chooses to do the cowl,
and I'm sculpting the face.</i>

09:12.998 --> 09:16.065
And the face
is fairly straightforward.

09:16.101 --> 09:18.668
<i>It's got
a little crayon-sharpener nose,</i>

09:18.720 --> 09:21.604
<i>and a big, giant,
waxy brow piece.</i>

09:21.656 --> 09:24.991
<i>And I really want to try
and get the face molded today.</i>

09:27.946 --> 09:30.847
So how do you want
to incorporate the numbers?

09:30.849 --> 09:32.649
I don't know
if we necessarily have to.

09:32.684 --> 09:34.017
We need numbers, for sure.

09:34.069 --> 09:36.069
We were told
to think outside the box,

09:36.121 --> 09:40.056
and we've decided to make
a watch face the watch face.

09:40.091 --> 09:41.658
<i>I'm feeling nervous</i>

09:41.693 --> 09:44.127
<i>that it's not original enough
to please the judges.</i>

09:44.162 --> 09:46.029
- What are your thoughts?
- They're not just gonna look,

09:46.031 --> 09:47.764
like, stuck on him this way?

09:47.799 --> 09:49.015
I don't think
it's gonna read a clock

09:49.050 --> 09:50.900
if we don't have numbers on it.

09:50.936 --> 09:53.586
So now Anna's upset,
and I'm upset.

09:53.638 --> 09:55.505
The thing that's happening
is you're over-thinking

09:55.507 --> 09:56.839
what the judges
are gonna say to you.

09:56.875 --> 09:57.857
Is that correct?

09:57.909 --> 09:59.008
- Am I...
- Yes.

09:59.044 --> 10:00.827
We still have to figure out
the concept,

10:00.862 --> 10:02.779
<i>but right now,
I'm just trying to</i>

10:02.831 --> 10:05.281
<i>get our hands on some clay
and get moving.</i>

19:55.977 --> 19:58.611
He's gonna
have some more fleshier tones

19:58.613 --> 20:00.029
<i>than a toy.</i>

20:00.031 --> 20:03.616
So we're gonna spatter in
some reds and some blues

20:03.618 --> 20:05.452
<i>to bring life to him.</i>

20:05.454 --> 20:08.888
We're also gonna make his nose
and his cheeks a little rosier

20:08.890 --> 20:12.509
to give him more
of that childlike, playful look.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.627
- He can be a little rosy?
- Yeah.

20:14.628 --> 20:16.518
The hat fits pretty good!

20:19.835 --> 20:21.734
<i>Kaleb and I are applying
at the same time.</i>

20:21.736 --> 20:23.403
<i>He starts applying
the chest piece</i>

20:23.405 --> 20:25.321
<i>while I start applying
the face piece,</i>

20:25.323 --> 20:26.739
and we're both working slow,

20:26.741 --> 20:28.842
because we want to have
the best edges out there.

20:28.844 --> 20:32.328
<i>And as I go, I'm dissolving
and blending the edges down</i>

20:32.330 --> 20:33.830
<i>with a bit of spirit gum.</i>

20:33.832 --> 20:36.149
I think this is gonna look
awesome when it's done.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.617
Can you just keep it
closed for a few minutes,

20:37.619 --> 20:39.886
- to let it dry real good?
- Okay.

20:43.008 --> 20:46.459
Njoroge and I get crayons
that we can melt down,

20:46.461 --> 20:49.796
<i>so we have working
crayon fingertips.</i>

20:49.798 --> 20:52.382
<i>As he's doing that,
I apply the cowl to our model.</i>

20:52.384 --> 20:53.383
Do you think
that feels all right?

20:53.385 --> 20:54.567
Yeah.

20:54.569 --> 20:57.020
There's one edge
that looks troublesome,

20:57.022 --> 20:59.639
and it's taking up a little but
more time than I'd have liked.

20:59.641 --> 21:02.025
<i>But I need to get it done
as fast as possible</i>

21:02.027 --> 21:04.177
so we can get this out in time.

21:10.902 --> 21:12.452
<i>We finally get our pieces
trimmed up,</i>

21:12.454 --> 21:14.354
<i>so it's time to paint the cowl.</i>

21:14.356 --> 21:16.523
<i>Rob starts by basing it out
in white,</i>

21:16.525 --> 21:18.925
so that the colors
will pop even stronger.

21:18.927 --> 21:21.027
<i>Then Johnny and I start going
in with the airbrush</i>

21:21.029 --> 21:24.264
and alcohol colors
that'll make the lollipop sing.

21:24.266 --> 21:25.598
Over the top, right?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.350
To a land of whimsy.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.352
<i>The paint's adding
dimensionality,</i>

21:29.354 --> 21:31.437
and it looks really beautiful.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.645
<i>I start painting
around the face,</i>

21:38.647 --> 21:40.613
but I notice that Robert's

21:40.615 --> 21:42.448
spending a lot of time
on the cowl.

21:42.450 --> 21:44.984
<i>And I need
to blend them together,</i>

21:44.986 --> 21:47.487
so I'm giving more direction.

21:47.489 --> 21:49.639
Is this all dry or no?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.391
Some not.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.527
Finally, I just grab it
and put it on the model

21:54.529 --> 21:56.779
<i>and start gluing down the cowl.</i>

21:56.781 --> 21:58.815
How's that fitting so far?

21:58.817 --> 22:00.333
I'm scared
to be in bottom looks,

22:00.335 --> 22:03.303
<i>so I'm going as quickly
as possible.</i>

22:03.305 --> 22:04.604
Don't pull too hard.

22:04.606 --> 22:06.573
15 minutes, everyone!

22:15.083 --> 22:16.916
That's time!

22:18.203 --> 22:20.286
<i>Blending the cowl edge
took a lot of time,</i>

22:20.288 --> 22:23.723
so I don't feel like our paint
is where it needs to be.

22:23.725 --> 22:26.643
It's streaky,
and it's not looking

22:26.645 --> 22:28.828
like we'd hoped
it would look right now.

22:28.830 --> 22:30.813
So we're gonna need
to do something in Last Looks

22:30.815 --> 22:33.066
<i>to fix this.</i>

22:41.264 --> 22:42.413
Let me plug this blow dryer in.

22:42.415 --> 22:44.198
So we have one hour left,

22:44.200 --> 22:45.867
<i>and we have a face to apply,</i>

22:45.869 --> 22:48.603
which is immediately
what we start doing.

22:49.956 --> 22:52.407
<i>Then when we do start
painting our yellow,</i>

22:52.409 --> 22:54.409
it's got translucency,

22:54.411 --> 22:57.512
which is allowing the actor's
skin to bleed through.

22:57.514 --> 22:58.830
I don't think there's anything

22:58.832 --> 23:00.415
we can do to help
this paint job.

23:00.417 --> 23:03.084
It's not looking
like either of us wanted,

23:03.086 --> 23:04.585
<i>so we're just going with it,</i>

23:04.587 --> 23:06.637
<i>and hopefully we can get it out.</i>

23:08.808 --> 23:11.759
There was a lot of pressure on
me to do a great beauty makeup,

23:11.761 --> 23:14.562
<i>because the face is
the focal point of any makeup.</i>

23:14.564 --> 23:17.432
I grab Kryolan Supracolor
grease colors.

23:17.434 --> 23:20.451
<i>It's exactly what I wanted.
Everything looks perfect.</i>

23:21.871 --> 23:25.339
We have to finish painting
around the eyes, apply the cowl,

23:25.341 --> 23:26.657
and get our model dressed.

23:26.659 --> 23:28.075
Okay, bring the back lower.

23:28.077 --> 23:29.544
<i>Three artists and one model...</i>

23:29.546 --> 23:30.962
it's very crowded,

23:30.964 --> 23:33.014
but somehow we manage to not get
in one another's way.

23:33.016 --> 23:34.649
<i>We're working as a perfect team,</i>

23:34.651 --> 23:36.851
and it's pretty incredible
to see it come together.

23:36.853 --> 23:38.152
Yeah.

23:40.707 --> 23:42.907
<i>I'm sealing the eyes
and she's sealing the mouth,</i>

23:42.909 --> 23:44.408
<i>and it's coming together.</i>

23:44.410 --> 23:45.860
<i>I'm definitely feeling
the adrenalin again.</i>

23:45.862 --> 23:47.061
<i>I'm feeling nervous.</i>

23:47.063 --> 23:49.263
But this time,
I'm feeling more confident.

23:49.265 --> 23:50.698

That's time!

24:01.394 --> 24:02.410
We did it.

24:02.412 --> 24:03.744
We could be in trouble.

24:03.746 --> 24:04.912
- I think we are in trouble.
- It's okay.

24:04.914 --> 24:06.314
We're in lots of trouble.

24:06.316 --> 24:08.065
It's hard to look at.

24:08.067 --> 24:11.886
It's not in the same league
as the other makeups.

24:11.888 --> 24:14.338
We're gonna be talking
to the judges,

24:14.340 --> 24:15.790

24:35.545 --> 24:38.679
is super unexpected and...
and unbelievably cool.

24:38.681 --> 24:41.449
- Good evening, everyone.
- Good evening.

24:41.451 --> 24:43.935
Welcome to
the Face Off Reveal Stage.

Let me introduce you
to our incredible judges.

Owner of Alchemy Studio,
Glenn Hetrick.

24:48.958 --> 24:51.058
- Good evening.
all: - Hi, Glenn.

24:51.060 --> 24:53.794
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.046
Hi, everybody.

24:55.048 --> 24:56.614
All: Hi, Ve.

24:56.616 --> 24:59.000
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

24:59.002 --> 25:01.402
- Hi, guys.
all: - Hi, Neville.

25:01.404 --> 25:04.622
And finally, we are joined
tonight by an actor, writer,

25:04.624 --> 25:07.808
and producer who not only
created the iconic

25:07.810 --> 25:09.076
Pee-Wee Herman character,

25:09.078 --> 25:10.945
but also recently co-wrote,

25:10.947 --> 25:14.582
produced, and starred in
Pee-Wee's Big Holiday.

25:14.584 --> 25:16.450
Who better to judge
this challenge

25:16.452 --> 25:19.237
than the amazing Paul Reubens?

25:19.239 --> 25:21.639
Oh!
Thank you.

25:25.778 --> 25:27.194
Welcome, Paul.

25:27.196 --> 25:28.629
We're so thrilled to have
you here with us tonight.

25:28.631 --> 25:30.031
Great to be here.

25:30.033 --> 25:32.533
So you and Ve have worked
on a ton of things together.

25:32.535 --> 25:34.185
How is it to work together
again?

25:34.187 --> 25:36.904
It's amazing. We were just
together shooting my movie

25:36.906 --> 25:38.656
that Ve did the makeup on.

25:38.658 --> 25:40.942
And we've had a break,
so it's great to be back here.

25:40.944 --> 25:43.210
- You ready to see some makeups?
- Absolutely.

25:43.212 --> 25:45.179
All right, let's get to it.

26:09.305 --> 26:10.721
<i>I am nervous.</i>

26:10.723 --> 26:12.406
<i>I'm wondering if the face thing
is gonna bite us.</i>

26:12.408 --> 26:13.874
<i>I hope we're a top look,</i>

26:13.876 --> 26:15.743
but I would be happy
if we're just safe.

26:35.365 --> 26:36.931
<i>I'm still feeling
like a bottom look</i>

26:36.933 --> 26:38.332
<i>just because of
the terrible paint</i>

26:38.334 --> 26:40.234
<i>and the one edge on the cowl.</i>

26:40.236 --> 26:41.719
I know they're not gonna
be happy with it.

27:05.328 --> 27:06.761
<i>It's a beautiful makeup,</i>

27:06.763 --> 27:09.964
but everybody else's
looks wacky and crazy,

27:09.966 --> 27:11.983
and I'm worried
that ours doesn't fit.

27:30.787 --> 27:33.454
<i>It's definitely not one
of my best makeups,</i>

27:33.456 --> 27:35.856
so I'm worried Robert
and I may be a bottom look.

27:56.846 --> 27:58.679
<i>I feel really proud
of this makeup.</i>

27:58.681 --> 28:00.981
I feel like it's better
than I thought it would be,

28:00.983 --> 28:02.983
and we feel great.

28:24.941 --> 28:27.374
<i>I'm definitely happy
with how it all turned out.</i>

28:27.376 --> 28:29.543
The whole aesthetic of it
is very whimsical.

28:29.545 --> 28:31.078
<i>I think we could win this one.</i>

28:36.002 --> 28:38.052
All right, judges,
go ahead and take a closer look

28:38.054 --> 28:40.671
at these crazy,
colorful characters.

28:48.347 --> 28:49.764
I don't know why they thought
it would be all right

28:49.766 --> 28:51.565
to just paint the face silver.

28:51.567 --> 28:54.034
It feels like this is
mostly costume work.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.704
Can you turn around
for us, please?

28:56.706 --> 28:59.073
- That's cute.
- One side of it's matte,

28:59.075 --> 29:02.309
and the other side's shiny.
I like that.

29:02.311 --> 29:03.978
This is coming right up.

29:03.980 --> 29:05.446
Oh, I split that there.

29:05.448 --> 29:08.849
With something this big
and cumbersome,

29:08.851 --> 29:10.351
why not just fill in that neck?

29:10.353 --> 29:12.353
We do we even see an edge there?

29:12.355 --> 29:14.555
Even though it's supposed
to be a crayon, it's a makeup.

29:14.557 --> 29:17.408
It should've had some dimension
painted on it as well.

29:17.410 --> 29:18.876
I love the eyebrows.

29:18.878 --> 29:21.228
I'm not gonna marry 'em,
but I do like them a lot.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.798
So grungy.

29:23.800 --> 29:27.067
It's gone so grey on them.
There's so many colors layered.

29:27.069 --> 29:30.004
It almost does feel
like a corpse.

29:30.006 --> 29:32.923
I think that this is
an incredibly artistic,

29:32.925 --> 29:35.843
great idea that leaves
something to be desired

29:35.845 --> 29:38.612
in terms of the execution of it.

29:38.614 --> 29:40.381
I think this was
a really bad idea

29:40.383 --> 29:42.016
to put this thing on his nose.

29:42.018 --> 29:44.385
It looks like
a baby-bottle nipple.

29:44.387 --> 29:47.354
Ooh, some serious edge
problems here.

29:47.356 --> 29:49.373
<i>I see the judges
pointing out those edges,</i>

29:49.375 --> 29:50.925
<i>and I know they're really bad.</i>

29:50.927 --> 29:52.510
That's really rough.

29:52.512 --> 29:55.062
So I'm extremely worried.

29:57.767 --> 29:59.216
All right, guys,
it's time to get on Twitter

29:59.218 --> 30:00.885
and tell us who made
your favorite

30:00.887 --> 30:05.105
colorful character tonight,
using #FaceOff

30:08.096 --> 30:10.029
Ooh, some serious
edge problems here.

30:10.064 --> 30:12.515
I think they're pointing out
those edges, and that's scary.

30:12.550 --> 30:13.599
There's a pretty good chance

30:13.635 --> 30:15.067
we're gonna end up
at bottom looks.

30:15.103 --> 30:17.320
- It's scary too.
- Yes, I agree.

30:17.355 --> 30:19.639
I don't know if that's
intentional, but it is really...

30:19.674 --> 30:21.741
- It's the clown thing.
- Yeah.

30:23.161 --> 30:25.661
It has several different
colors stippled over it,

30:25.697 --> 30:27.797
just to bring it some depth
and complexity.

30:27.832 --> 30:30.049
- I'm really liking that.
- I am too.

30:30.084 --> 30:31.317
I think it's beautiful.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.688
I wanted to see
it be a happier lollipop.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.207
He looks like a sad lollipop.

30:38.243 --> 30:39.725
He's candy.

30:39.761 --> 30:42.628
All the ancillary ideas are
well expressed and developed.

30:42.664 --> 30:45.398
And the palette is really unique

30:45.433 --> 30:47.633
and still very childlike
and playful.

30:47.669 --> 30:50.561
- Thank you. - Thanks.
- Thank you.

30:53.541 --> 30:55.508
All right, the judges
have scored your creations,

30:55.510 --> 30:57.710
so let's find out
what they thought.

30:57.745 --> 31:00.813
Walter and Ant,

31:00.848 --> 31:02.748
Katie and Kaleb,

31:02.784 --> 31:05.184
congratulations,
because you are all safe

31:05.186 --> 31:08.237
and can head back
to the makeup room.

31:08.273 --> 31:09.755
Good job, Kaleb.

31:13.561 --> 31:16.162
So the rest of you were the
best and the worst this week,

31:16.197 --> 31:18.447
and the judges would like to
find out more about your work.

31:18.483 --> 31:21.400
Johnny, Melissa,
and Rob, you're up first.

31:30.561 --> 31:32.511
Let's start
by having you explain

31:32.547 --> 31:35.781
how your lollipop
inspired this creation.

31:35.783 --> 31:37.516
He's the imaginary friend
of a little boy.

31:37.552 --> 31:39.602
And his father
runs a candy store,

31:39.654 --> 31:41.270
which isn't doing so well.

31:41.322 --> 31:44.340
So this little boy
conjures up this lollipop man

31:44.392 --> 31:45.925
who will help
him run the candy store,

31:45.927 --> 31:48.728
because he's the king
of the other candies.

31:48.763 --> 31:51.897
I think this is
a highly successful character.

31:51.933 --> 31:53.299
Who did what?

31:53.334 --> 31:55.985
I sculpted about 80%
of the cowl.

31:56.037 --> 31:57.737
Melissa and Johnny
tackled the face.

31:57.739 --> 31:59.538
Melissa and Johnny tackled
the vest.

31:59.540 --> 32:02.341
I created the cane topper,

32:02.377 --> 32:04.143
and we all painted everything.

32:04.178 --> 32:06.345
Well, you've got a lot
of colors going on here,

32:06.381 --> 32:08.681
and they're all working
in concert, they're harmonious.

32:08.716 --> 32:11.550
And for this challenge,
I think it's very appropriate.

32:11.586 --> 32:13.152
Thank you.

32:13.187 --> 32:15.287
The headpiece
is really beautiful.

32:15.289 --> 32:17.823
It's very childlike...
just what I asked for.

32:17.859 --> 32:19.959
And I'm very happy
with this makeup.

32:19.994 --> 32:21.193
You guys did a great job.

32:21.245 --> 32:22.495
Thank you.

32:22.497 --> 32:25.514
It's been making me crave sugar.

32:25.566 --> 32:27.867
I love the color palette.
I think it's beautiful.

32:27.869 --> 32:30.486
The headpiece is beautiful.
I love everything about it.

32:30.538 --> 32:32.938
I just wanted it to be happier.

32:34.242 --> 32:35.608
My favorite part
about the character

32:35.660 --> 32:40.646
is its appropriation
of the elements of candy

32:40.682 --> 32:42.214
in a unique way.

32:42.216 --> 32:45.751
You've managed to keep
it childlike, yet sophisticated.

32:45.787 --> 32:48.404
Johnny, Melissa,
and Rob, please step back.

32:54.862 --> 32:56.929
Njoroge and Jennifer.

33:04.572 --> 33:06.172
Tell us about your character.

33:06.207 --> 33:08.074
He's one of the crayons
that lives in the box.

33:08.109 --> 33:10.359
He has put together his assembly
of crayons

33:10.395 --> 33:11.727
to communicate, with his pad,

33:11.779 --> 33:14.213
and has jumped out of the box
to find the other toys.

33:14.248 --> 33:19.518
It's not quite as cool
as it could've been.

33:19.554 --> 33:21.887
You have some problems
with your neckpiece.

33:21.923 --> 33:24.190
And the fact that you didn't do
any highlighting and shadowing

33:24.225 --> 33:28.127
to give it more life...
that was a missed opportunity.

33:28.179 --> 33:29.562
The thing that bothered me...

33:29.564 --> 33:32.164
and I would say
almost tortures me...

33:32.200 --> 33:34.433
is, he's a yellow crayon.

33:34.469 --> 33:35.851
If he's gonna write on himself,

33:35.887 --> 33:37.236
it has to be yellow.

33:37.271 --> 33:38.871
Even though you
have all those colors,

33:38.923 --> 33:41.807
I wanted to see yellow.

33:41.859 --> 33:45.528
Head to toe, it just feels a
little uninteresting, visually.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.196
And it feels incomplete.

33:47.248 --> 33:51.450
You end up
with just this yellow stick.

33:51.486 --> 33:52.718
Explain to me how you broke down

33:52.754 --> 33:54.653
the responsibilities
on this makeup.

33:54.689 --> 33:57.857
I sculpted the cowl
and Njoroge did the face.

33:57.859 --> 33:59.291
We both painted.

33:59.293 --> 34:01.127
You haven't done a whole lot
prosthetically,

34:01.162 --> 34:03.863
and you've kneecapped yourselves
by making it all one color.

34:03.898 --> 34:05.664
Right.

34:05.666 --> 34:08.016
Njoroge and Jennifer,
would you please step down?

34:14.509 --> 34:16.442
Anna and Mel,
please step forward.

34:22.766 --> 34:26.185
Would you please explain
what's behind the concept?

34:26.187 --> 34:28.237
When the toys
are alive and playing,

34:28.272 --> 34:30.656
his role is to warn them

34:30.690 --> 34:32.141
when the children
are coming back to the room,

34:32.193 --> 34:34.260
so all the toys can go to sleep.

34:34.295 --> 34:36.629
But he's a little kooky,
because he never sleeps.

34:36.664 --> 34:38.297
He's always watching.

34:38.331 --> 34:39.764
- Pun intended?
- Yes.

34:39.817 --> 34:43.803
- [laughter]
- I like everything about this.

34:43.838 --> 34:46.371
The band on his neck

34:46.373 --> 34:49.809
and how you've configured it
on the side and on the top

34:49.844 --> 34:52.545
and how that fits
I think is really extraordinary.

34:52.580 --> 34:53.746
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

34:53.781 --> 34:56.681
You've managed
to use four different colors

34:56.717 --> 34:58.584
of stipple on the face,

34:58.619 --> 35:02.188
so this creates an illusion
of humanity,

35:02.223 --> 35:05.324
because you treated the face
of the clock like skin.

35:05.359 --> 35:07.109
That was very well thought out.

35:07.161 --> 35:08.344
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

35:08.396 --> 35:10.112
Who did what on this character?

35:10.148 --> 35:15.217
I was responsible for the face
and the neck and the paint job,

35:15.269 --> 35:17.403
and Anna sculpted the cowl.

35:17.438 --> 35:19.538
This is a really
successful makeup.

35:19.574 --> 35:21.307
Your paint job is gorgeous.

35:21.342 --> 35:23.108
You really took your time
with this,

35:23.144 --> 35:25.394
and did an exquisite makeup job.

35:25.429 --> 35:27.246
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Thank you.

35:27.298 --> 35:29.248
Anna and Mel, you can head back.

35:29.283 --> 35:30.449
Thank you.

35:30.484 --> 35:32.334
[both giggling]

35:34.455 --> 35:36.572
Yay.

35:36.624 --> 35:38.357
Robert and Yvonne.

35:45.650 --> 35:47.399
Tell us about your concept.

35:47.401 --> 35:51.570
Well, we got the dice,
and they represent board games.

35:51.606 --> 35:54.390
So we thought
we'd incorporate a character

35:54.425 --> 35:55.808
with board game items,

35:55.843 --> 35:58.360
and we turned it
into Board Game Man.

35:58.396 --> 36:01.397
It's clear
that he's Board Game Guy,

36:01.449 --> 36:04.400
which is a great name
for a character.

36:04.435 --> 36:06.986
Thank you.
It's Board Game Man.

36:06.988 --> 36:09.872
Board Game Man,
excuse me... even better.

36:09.924 --> 36:13.542
Do you see the way
he's looking at us?

36:13.578 --> 36:15.127
It's creepy and weird,

36:15.162 --> 36:19.498
and that's the part that bothers
me a bit about this.

36:19.533 --> 36:22.268
The sculptural forms on the face

36:22.303 --> 36:24.536
and the lack
of proportion change

36:24.572 --> 36:29.491
make it feel horror,
versus playful.

36:29.543 --> 36:33.212
Can you tell me how you
split up the workload here?

36:33.247 --> 36:35.231
I sculpted the cowl,
the headpiece,

36:35.283 --> 36:36.815
and she did the face.

36:36.867 --> 36:41.537
It feels underdeveloped in
how you translated your concept

36:41.589 --> 36:43.222
into a makeup.

36:43.257 --> 36:44.390
He's just so spooky,

36:44.425 --> 36:46.258
with his human eyes
showing through this...

36:46.294 --> 36:49.178
this otherwise playful makeup.

36:49.213 --> 36:52.298
I got to agree with everybody.
He's scary.

36:52.350 --> 36:56.418
You cannot take
a baby-bottle nipple

36:56.470 --> 36:58.671
and put it
over someone's nipple.

36:58.723 --> 37:00.773
If you have a nipple shape,
it can't go on a nipple,

37:00.808 --> 37:02.574
unless you're really
going for a nipple there.

37:02.610 --> 37:05.778
I'm sorry I'm saying
"nipple" so many times.

37:05.813 --> 37:10.182
It's okay. We... we tried to
keep it away from two of them,

37:10.184 --> 37:11.634
'cause we noticed that.
So don't worry.

37:11.686 --> 37:15.754
Yeah, um, I understand
what you were going for,

37:15.790 --> 37:18.190
but I... I think it's a mistake.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.459
Robert and Yvonne,
you can head back.

37:28.152 --> 37:29.568
All right, thank you guys.
If you'd please head back

37:29.570 --> 37:31.971
to the makeup room
while the judges deliberate.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.881
Hi, judges.
So, just as a reminder,

37:42.917 --> 37:45.517
you do have
that one-time special immunity

37:45.553 --> 37:47.252
that you may use, if you wish.

37:47.288 --> 37:48.921
So, with that,
let's start with the looks

37:48.956 --> 37:50.289
you liked the most this week.

37:50.341 --> 37:53.392
Why don't we begin with Rob,
Johnny, and Melissa?

37:53.427 --> 37:54.893
<i>I really thought it was
a very cohesive,</i>

37:54.929 --> 37:56.862
<i>complete design...</i>

37:56.897 --> 37:59.898
<i>beautiful colors, beautiful
palette, really exceptional.</i>

37:59.934 --> 38:04.320
It was fantastic, right down
to the jacket that I loved.

38:04.372 --> 38:06.138
<i>It was so beautiful, the colors.</i>

38:06.190 --> 38:09.258
And up close... it was
so much better up close even.

38:09.310 --> 38:11.543
Let's move on to Anna and Mel.

38:11.579 --> 38:13.412
<i>I think they did
a fantastic job.</i>

38:13.447 --> 38:15.731
<i>Everything was just
beautifully painted.</i>

38:15.766 --> 38:17.149
<i>They had all those
beautiful levels,</i>

38:17.184 --> 38:18.484
<i>that slight blush cheek.</i>

38:18.519 --> 38:19.852
<i>They gave it great direction.</i>

38:19.887 --> 38:23.355
Sculpturally,
there was a lot of form

38:23.357 --> 38:25.374
pulled away
from the actor's face,

38:25.409 --> 38:29.178
<i>but they retained his ability
to really perform through it.</i>

38:29.230 --> 38:30.729
<i>I thought,
more than anyone else,</i>

38:30.765 --> 38:32.664
<i>the model really helped it.</i>

38:32.700 --> 38:33.966
He just sold that.

38:34.001 --> 38:35.467
So let's talk about the looks

38:35.503 --> 38:37.536
that weren't so successful
tonight.

38:37.588 --> 38:39.338
Let's start
with Jennifer and Njoroge.

38:39.373 --> 38:40.873
<i>They really missed
the opportunity</i>

38:40.925 --> 38:42.658
<i>to do a really cool paint job
on it.</i>

38:42.710 --> 38:44.309
<i>They just left it flat.</i>

38:44.345 --> 38:46.779
The idea of making
it a single crayon

38:46.814 --> 38:48.247
<i>and painting it
a single color...</i>

38:48.282 --> 38:49.915
<i>it's just a poor idea.</i>

38:49.950 --> 38:53.502
It was devoid of any cosmetic
interest whatsoever.

38:53.537 --> 38:55.721
All right,
and lastly, Robert and Yvonne.

38:55.756 --> 38:57.556
<i>Because of the scale issue
of the head</i>

38:57.591 --> 38:58.857
<i>and some
of the sculptural choices</i>

38:58.909 --> 39:00.409
<i>with this blank, white face,</i>

39:00.444 --> 39:02.411
it pushed it
into a horror category.

39:02.446 --> 39:04.663
It was just confusing,
the whole head.

39:04.698 --> 39:06.548
<i>Getting rid of his ears</i>

39:06.584 --> 39:09.134
<i>and just seeing the corners
of the dice like bookends</i>

39:09.186 --> 39:11.236
<i>on the side of his head
made his head look really tiny.</i>

39:11.272 --> 39:12.771
- And it did...
- It did, didn't it?

39:12.807 --> 39:14.173
It looked weird compared
to the rest of the body,

39:14.208 --> 39:16.475
And the way that they
translated this concept...

39:16.510 --> 39:19.711
interpreted it
as a makeup... was a failure.

39:19.747 --> 39:22.214
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:22.216 --> 39:24.283
- We have.
- Let's bring 'em back out.

39:26.670 --> 39:27.870
Welcome back, guys.

39:27.922 --> 39:30.022
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

39:30.057 --> 39:31.890
Rob, Johnny, and Melissa,

39:31.926 --> 39:34.526
your artistic flair was on full
display with this character,

39:34.562 --> 39:36.862
and the colors
were exceptionally well-tailored

39:36.897 --> 39:38.630
to this challenge.

39:38.666 --> 39:41.533
Anna and Mel, your character
is sweet and fun,

39:41.569 --> 39:43.335
which is just
what it should've been.

39:43.370 --> 39:45.737
And the paint on the face
was quite exquisite.

39:45.773 --> 39:47.239
Okay,
which team came out on top?

39:47.274 --> 39:48.907
The top team tonight is...

39:55.108 --> 39:56.841
Okay which team came out on top?

39:56.843 --> 39:58.310
The top team tonight is...

40:02.132 --> 40:03.598
Anna and Mel.

40:05.953 --> 40:07.619
You did a phenomenal job

40:07.621 --> 40:10.789
translating your object
into a convincing character.

40:10.791 --> 40:14.526
And that is no easy task
when the object is a watch.

40:14.528 --> 40:15.694
- Great job.
- Thank you.

40:15.696 --> 40:18.380
- Thank you.
- Anna and Mel, congratulations.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.864
But, as you know,

40:19.866 --> 40:23.201
we can only have one winner.
Glenn?

40:23.203 --> 40:26.204
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:26.206 --> 40:27.772
Mel.

40:27.774 --> 40:30.942
- Yay.
- Thank you.

40:30.944 --> 40:32.577
You did a beautiful paint job
on the face,

40:32.579 --> 40:35.113
and the sculpture really
allowed your character to shine.

40:35.115 --> 40:37.082
- Well done.
- I feel so,

40:37.084 --> 40:39.200
so honored to be the winner.

40:39.202 --> 40:42.253
<i>Winning this challenge is gonna
help me, moving forward,</i>

40:42.255 --> 40:45.790
and I feel like I can create
great things because of this.

40:45.792 --> 40:47.892
- Mel, congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:47.894 --> 40:50.812
You, Anna, Rob, Johnny,
and Melissa

40:50.814 --> 40:52.998
are all safe and can
head back to the makeup room.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.950
- Thank you.
- Thank you guys.

40:54.951 --> 40:56.942
- Good job.
- Good job.

40:59.856 --> 41:01.356
All right, guys,
that means the rest of you

41:01.358 --> 41:02.557
are on the bottom,

41:02.559 --> 41:05.076
and one of you will be
going home tonight.

41:05.078 --> 41:06.711
Please step forward.

41:14.838 --> 41:17.322
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom teams.

41:17.324 --> 41:20.692
Jennifer and Njoroge,
you had a few good ideas,

41:20.694 --> 41:23.595
but you shot yourselves
in the foot choosing yellow

41:23.597 --> 41:26.898
and not adding any shading
or graphic to break it up.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.633
Robert and Yvonne,

41:28.635 --> 41:31.803
the board game concept
was a good one for your dice,

41:31.805 --> 41:34.506
but ultimately,
it felt underdeveloped

41:34.508 --> 41:37.709
in terms of your ability
to execute the makeup.

41:37.711 --> 41:39.544
So who's going home tonight?

41:39.546 --> 41:41.162
The person
going home tonight is...

41:45.786 --> 41:48.703
Jennifer.

41:48.705 --> 41:51.506
While we did have several issues
with the makeup,

41:51.508 --> 41:55.643
one of our least favorite pieces
was the disproportionate cowl.

41:55.645 --> 41:57.178
Okay.

41:57.180 --> 42:00.582
Jennifer, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

42:00.584 --> 42:03.835
That means Njoroge, Robert,
and Yvonne,

42:03.837 --> 42:06.237
you're safe this week and can
head back to the makeup room.

42:12.679 --> 42:15.346
Jennifer, because it's so
early in the competition,

42:15.348 --> 42:16.881
we really haven't gotten
to see everything

42:16.883 --> 42:18.550
that you're capable of doing.

42:18.552 --> 42:20.618
But I hope you had a good time
while you were here, honey.

42:20.620 --> 42:22.337
Sure, I did.
You guys are awesome.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.923
Jennifer, it's been so great
having you here with us.

42:24.925 --> 42:27.258
But if you'd please head
back to the makeup room

42:27.260 --> 42:28.460
and pack up your kit.

42:28.462 --> 42:29.644
- Thank you guys.
- Thank you.

42:29.646 --> 42:31.229
- Good luck.
- Good night. Bye, honey.

42:31.231 --> 42:33.765
- Good luck.
- I know I could've done better,

42:33.767 --> 42:37.786
but I know my family's gonna
be proud of me.

42:37.788 --> 42:39.671
It's me.

42:39.673 --> 42:40.905
What?

42:40.907 --> 42:42.640
I love to do makeup,

42:42.642 --> 42:45.443
and being on Face Off has
given me a lot of confidence

42:45.445 --> 42:47.479
that I could do
this professionally.

42:47.481 --> 42:52.217
I learned a lot,
and I'm only gonna get better.

42:52.219 --> 42:56.743
I'm excited to put my skills
into something amazing.
