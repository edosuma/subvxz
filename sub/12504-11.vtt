00:05.606 --> 00:07.408
[Payson] Previously
on Make It or Break It:

00:07.408 --> 00:10.641
The guy at the party you
lost your virginity too?

00:10.641 --> 00:12.713
- It was Carter?
- I'm sorry.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.784
I love you too.

00:13.784 --> 00:15.746
But it's over.

00:15.746 --> 00:17.448
Look, I'll be your teammate,

00:17.448 --> 00:19.550
but I will never
be your friend again.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.592
Watch out for her
while I'm out?

00:21.592 --> 00:22.753
Yes, sir.

00:22.753 --> 00:25.796
I sent some songs to a producer.
He sent me a ticket to LA.

00:25.796 --> 00:27.258
I leave next week.

00:27.258 --> 00:29.730
- I bought cortisone illegally.
- Where'd you get it?

00:29.730 --> 00:32.103
I don't think I can make it
through Nationals without it.

00:32.103 --> 00:36.737
[man] This routine could
make Payson Keeler the next
Nationals all-around champion.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.669
[crowd gasps]

00:38.669 --> 00:44.215
[man] And your new National
champion, Miss Kaylie Cruz.

00:44.215 --> 00:46.717
Way to kick some ass.

00:49.420 --> 00:55.586
[rock music]

00:55.586 --> 00:57.658
It just feels so weird
without Payson.

00:57.658 --> 01:01.462
I heard she can't even walk.
How tragic is that?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.364
Except she can walk.
You heard wrong.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.436
We should have a telethon
or a party or something.

01:05.436 --> 01:07.067
Raise money to buy
her a wheelchair.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.140
She can walk, Lo.
The doctors just said

01:09.140 --> 01:12.403
that she can't do
gymnastics anymore.

01:16.147 --> 01:17.278
Well...

01:17.278 --> 01:19.580
What happens if she
doesn't listen to them?

01:20.751 --> 01:23.184
Then I guess she really
won't be able to walk.

01:23.614 --> 01:24.755
Pay!

01:24.755 --> 01:26.487
What are you doing here?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.119
Gotta train.

01:35.626 --> 01:38.399
You don't think I'm going
to let you win Nationals
again next year, do you?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.100
- But, what about...?
- My back?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.232
It was just
a muscle strain.

01:41.232 --> 01:42.733
The doctors were wrong.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.744
[Sasha]
What are you waiting for?

01:53.744 --> 01:55.616
You can do this.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.682
[applauding]

02:32.753 --> 02:35.556
[laughter]

02:42.833 --> 02:44.735
[dog barking]

03:01.752 --> 03:04.385
[Kim] Is Payson still sleeping?

03:04.385 --> 03:06.317
She was. Her door's closed.

03:06.317 --> 03:11.222
You don't think the physical
therapist is pushing her too
hard, do you?

03:11.222 --> 03:12.463
I don't think that's possible.

03:12.463 --> 03:14.765
Don't worry.
She said it's going great.

03:14.765 --> 03:15.966
That's reassuring.

03:15.966 --> 03:18.799
She also says
she's sleeping great.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.371
And her back feels great.

03:20.371 --> 03:21.672
It's great to be home.

03:21.672 --> 03:23.804
It's great to have
time to herself...

03:23.804 --> 03:26.607
Hey, is it so hard to
believe that we've raised
a well-adjusted child

03:26.607 --> 03:27.808
who knows how to deal
with adversity?

03:27.808 --> 03:30.611
No. But, Mark,
things are not great.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.684
She's just lost the only
dream she ever had.

03:33.684 --> 03:36.687
If it were me I would be...

03:36.687 --> 03:40.551
I don't know, sad or mad
or depressed...

03:44.655 --> 03:46.657
She won't even
talk to her friends.

03:46.657 --> 03:48.729
Give her time.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.332
She's only been home
for a few days.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.664
The parade's on.
Can we watch it?

03:53.664 --> 03:55.466
[Mark]
Becca, we talked about this.

03:55.466 --> 03:57.908
- Maybe we should go outside...
- Please. I wanna see it.

03:57.908 --> 03:59.770
- Becca.
- But it's not fair.

03:59.770 --> 04:00.641
[Payson] C'mon.

04:03.274 --> 04:04.475
Everyone loves a parade.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.748
I want to see it, too.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.751
- Are you sure you're up to it?
- Relax, Mom, I feel great.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.823
Seriously.
I just want to watch it,

04:12.823 --> 04:14.785
not march in it.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.757
OK.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.658
Yay!

04:18.859 --> 04:20.691
Great.

04:20.691 --> 04:22.993
[marching band plays]

04:26.036 --> 04:28.369
[girl] All right, Kaylie!

04:28.369 --> 04:30.441
[man on TV] You couldn't ask
for a better day.

04:30.441 --> 04:32.973
Sunshine, blue skies,
and hundreds of fans

04:32.973 --> 04:36.777
gathered to show their
appreciation for some
world-class athletes

04:36.777 --> 04:38.749
who live and train
right here in Boulder.

04:38.749 --> 04:41.682
I think it's fair to say that
the young woman coming up next

04:41.682 --> 04:43.654
is today's star attraction.

04:43.654 --> 04:46.286
Kaylie Cruz, the new
Women's National Champion.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.018
- She looks great.
- [man] Riding alongside Kaylie

04:48.018 --> 04:51.662
is Men's National silver
medalist, Nicky Russo.

04:51.662 --> 04:55.366
What about Lauren and Emily?
I don't see them.

04:57.368 --> 04:58.869
This is so humiliating.

04:58.869 --> 05:00.771
You don't see Kaylie
throwing candy.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.508
She wouldn't have even won if
Payson hadn't broken her back.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.079
That's not fair.
You don't know that.

05:09.079 --> 05:11.442
[Lauren] Life isn't fair.

05:12.843 --> 05:14.345
Candy, candy!

05:14.345 --> 05:15.546
[man on TV] In a few moments

05:15.546 --> 05:16.747
the athletes will be
arriving...

05:16.747 --> 05:19.319
Can you record the rest for me?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.321
I think I want to get
a nap in before lunch.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.495
- Do you need some help?
- No. I can do it.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.503
[man on TV]
That was coach Sasha Belov.

05:32.503 --> 05:35.335
[Mark] She seemed to handle
that pretty well.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.668
[sighs] That's what worries me.

05:37.668 --> 05:38.769
[door closes]

05:58.589 --> 05:59.590
[cheering, applauding]

06:04.665 --> 06:08.138
[woman] Congratulations
to Coach Sasha Belov,

06:08.138 --> 06:12.042
for leading four of The Rock's
gymnasts to the National Team.

06:12.042 --> 06:15.646
To silver medalist, Nicky Russo.

06:15.646 --> 06:17.778
And especially to gold
medal-winning

06:17.778 --> 06:20.781
National Champion,
Kaylie Cruz!

06:21.381 --> 06:22.683
Kaylie?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.455
On behalf of the city
of Boulder,

06:24.455 --> 06:27.017
I'd like to present you
with the key to this city.

06:27.017 --> 06:30.861
We declare today,
Kaylie Cruz Day.

06:31.522 --> 06:33.724
Yay, Kaylie!

06:34.695 --> 06:37.428
Thank you, mayor.

06:37.428 --> 06:40.671
This has been such
an amazing day.

06:40.671 --> 06:44.705
I want to thank
the people of Boulder
for all of your support.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.809
To my coach, my family
and my teammates,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.141
I couldn't have done
this without you.

06:51.141 --> 06:52.743
[applause]

06:52.743 --> 06:54.184
And, of course,

06:54.184 --> 06:57.518
it is today that we stand
here with a heavy heart

06:57.518 --> 07:00.420
trying to celebrate,
when our teammate and friend,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.993
Payson Keeler, should be
standing here right now.

07:02.993 --> 07:04.895
[mayor] Right.

07:04.895 --> 07:07.858
Well, Kaylie, if you think
this celebration is something,

07:07.858 --> 07:10.601
wait till you see the party
we're going to throw you

07:10.601 --> 07:14.004
when you bring home
Olympic gold in 2012!

07:14.004 --> 07:15.666
Isn't that right, everyone?

07:22.072 --> 07:24.945
[cameras clicking]

07:27.718 --> 07:30.050
Must be hard to watch.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.552
Do me a favor...

07:31.552 --> 07:33.453
Leave me alone.

07:35.526 --> 07:36.787
Great day, huh?

07:36.787 --> 07:39.760
Says Kaylie Cruz
on Kaylie Cruz Day.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.761
I should be training.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.634
You can take one day off.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.165
No, I can't, actually.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.937
You see winning requires focus.

07:48.138 --> 07:49.640
Payson understood that.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.702
Well, I'm sorry I'm not Payson.

07:51.702 --> 07:53.574
- Thank you, guys.
- Yeah.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.179
Great idea, putting us together.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.611
You're good for each other.

08:00.611 --> 08:01.952
PR wise.

08:01.952 --> 08:03.814
The press loves it.
And it gets your face out there.

08:03.814 --> 08:07.658
- Yeah, about that...
- Not my idea. But I like it.

08:07.658 --> 08:09.119
So after the
autograph-signing,

08:09.119 --> 08:10.691
you've got a couple
phone interviews

08:10.691 --> 08:11.822
and another
with a local paper.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.194
But it's Kaylie Cruz Day.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.495
Exactly.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.997
It's about you,
Kaylie, not for you.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.029
Your life is no
longer your own.

08:19.029 --> 08:20.901
You'll be traveling
all over the world,

08:20.901 --> 08:23.834
competing
in international events
on behalf of your country.

08:23.834 --> 08:27.838
Everything you do and say
will be analyzed, critiqued
and reported on.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.880
This is only the beginning.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.682
But it will be worth it.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.746
Every time I call,
she's resting.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.589
[Emily] Her mom
keeps telling me she's
not up to having any visitors.

08:38.589 --> 08:41.692
Guys, when she wants us
to come over she'll let us know.

08:41.692 --> 08:44.625
You're just saying that because
you haven't even tried to call.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.827
We're her friends. We should
just go to the Spruce Juice,

08:46.827 --> 08:48.198
pick her up something
and surprise her.

08:48.198 --> 08:50.761
- What do you think, Kay?
- Don't.

08:50.761 --> 08:52.703
- What?
- Include me.

08:52.703 --> 08:55.305
Like we're friends. We're not.

08:55.305 --> 08:56.807
- Hi.
- How about some forgiveness?

08:56.807 --> 08:59.810
How about some "are you
frigging kidding me?"

08:59.810 --> 09:03.113
Now, I'd really like a year
of no drama, if you don't mind.

09:03.914 --> 09:05.576
Congratulations, Kaylie.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.818
You did it. You deserve it

09:07.818 --> 09:10.080
and everything
that comes with it.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.882
- Thanks, Carter.
- I wish you the best.

09:11.882 --> 09:13.283
Always.

09:17.828 --> 09:19.089
Kaylie, are you OK?

09:20.731 --> 09:22.763
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.064
With all this craziness,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.796
I'm glad he's not
at The Rock anymore.

09:25.796 --> 09:27.738
It's going to be hard
enough to focus as it is.

09:27.738 --> 09:29.269
Right. No drama.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.702
Yeah. Why don't you try it?

09:34.745 --> 09:37.077
What? I hate drama.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.081
[Mark] I'm going to miss this.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.783
What?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.815
Us. Being together.

09:44.815 --> 09:46.957
I have to go back to Minnesota
next week for work.

09:46.957 --> 09:48.789
- No.
- I don't have a choice, honey.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.821
I've used up
all my vacation days.

09:50.821 --> 09:52.823
I've been thinking about it.

09:52.823 --> 09:55.095
Why should Dad go to Minnesota
while we all stay here?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.767
You know why, Payson.
That's where my job is.

09:56.767 --> 09:59.099
No, no. I know that. But...

09:59.099 --> 10:00.801
But why don't
we all go with you?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.734
The only reason we moved
here was so I could
train at The Rock.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.636
I'm never going back
to The Rock.

10:05.636 --> 10:06.637
I don't want to.

10:06.637 --> 10:07.908
So there's nothing left
for us here.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.780
It's a little more
complicated than that.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.643
No, it isn't.
We should move back.

10:17.748 --> 10:19.650
- You came!
- I wouldn't miss this.

10:19.650 --> 10:22.092
I'm celebrating someone
who made the National Team.

10:22.092 --> 10:25.325
Barely. If you haven't noticed
it isn't Emily Kmetko Day.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.097
Well, it's a national holiday
to me.

10:27.097 --> 10:30.661
And, like it or not,
I am celebrating you.

10:30.661 --> 10:32.332
Oh, be careful,
Sasha's here.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.734
Come here.

10:39.269 --> 10:41.942
You know what, I think today
we should celebrate you?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.074
Going to LA and
becoming a rock star.

10:44.074 --> 10:46.416
Songwriter. And don't
change the subject.

10:46.416 --> 10:47.878
This is about you.

10:47.878 --> 10:49.149
OK? Living your dream.

10:50.781 --> 10:51.982
I am...

10:51.982 --> 10:55.185
...so far beyond
my dream right now.

10:55.185 --> 10:56.757
This is amazing.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.228
Then you gotta dream bigger.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.060
Now, how...?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.693
How are we going
to celebrate?

11:02.693 --> 11:04.865
Oh, I know.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.170
"Admit one.

11:10.170 --> 11:14.104
Damon Young Unplugged
at the Starlight Lounge."

11:14.104 --> 11:15.846
Where's the Starlight Lounge?

11:15.846 --> 11:17.407
You've never been there?

11:17.407 --> 11:19.409
- No.
- Oh. You'll love it.

11:19.409 --> 11:20.981
Meet me at the Pizza Shack.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.853
Tomorrow night, closing.
We'll go from there.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.788
I'm so proud of you.
All of you.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.890
Who would've guessed
Kaylie would win Nationals?

11:29.890 --> 11:30.921
No one.

11:30.921 --> 11:32.723
You're happy for her,
aren't you?

11:32.723 --> 11:34.424
Oh, of course.
She's my best friend.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.226
She inspires me.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.769
- Oh, Lauren. That's nice.
- When Payson was number one,

11:38.769 --> 11:40.831
Kaylie and I took
turns being second.

11:40.831 --> 11:43.774
But now that Payson's
out, I figure I can be
number one, too.

11:43.774 --> 11:45.906
Well, that's great!

11:45.906 --> 11:49.109
Anything's possible with
hard work and determination.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.011
That's one way.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.844
Excuse me.

11:57.047 --> 11:59.489
Sasha? Can I talk to you?
It's important.

11:59.489 --> 12:01.321
Yeah. Of course.
What's it about?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.293
Carter Anderson.

12:03.293 --> 12:05.856
There's something
you should know.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.901
[doorbell]

12:10.901 --> 12:11.902
Hi!

12:11.902 --> 12:13.303
I hope it's not a bad time.

12:13.303 --> 12:15.235
- No, it's not. We're just...
- OK. Good.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.408
I hope you haven't had dinner.
I made my special casserole.

12:18.408 --> 12:21.812
Now, all you do is heat
it at 375 for 20 minutes.

12:21.812 --> 12:24.044
Three-seventy-five,
20 minutes. Got it.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.776
Oh!
And the most important part,

12:25.776 --> 12:27.417
after you take it
out of the oven,

12:27.417 --> 12:30.050
crumble up these potato chips
and sprinkle them on top.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.222
Don't do it before,
'cause they get all soggy.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.825
Good to know.
Got it. Thank you.

12:34.825 --> 12:37.757
Honey, don't you want
to go see Payson?

12:37.757 --> 12:38.959
Do you think that would be OK?

12:38.959 --> 12:40.791
Don't be silly.
You're her friend.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.332
- She needs friends. Go!
- [Mark] Sure.

12:42.332 --> 12:43.493
Go.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.266
Look...

12:46.266 --> 12:47.968
I know I wasn't invited,

12:47.968 --> 12:50.770
but I also know how you
can put yourself in a hole

12:50.770 --> 12:53.203
and forget about the rest
of the world when you're hurt.

12:53.203 --> 12:55.305
How are you guys doing?

12:55.305 --> 12:57.547
It's getting better every day.

12:57.547 --> 12:59.850
It's tough to watch
her struggle, though.

12:59.850 --> 13:01.381
We try to stay grateful.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.783
We keep reminding ourselves it
could have been so much worse.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.416
Payson could have wound up
in a wheelchair...

13:08.788 --> 13:11.161
I'm so sorry.

13:11.161 --> 13:13.894
Brian. I wasn't thinking.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.896
Hey. Don't worry.

13:15.896 --> 13:18.328
If there's anybody who knows
what you're going through, I do.

13:18.328 --> 13:19.830
If you ever need
to talk I'm here.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.331
[Mark] Thank you
for coming, Chloe.

13:21.331 --> 13:22.572
Really.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.375
Oh, give me a hug.

13:27.878 --> 13:29.809
So I saw you on TV
in the parade.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.942
Nice hat.
They let you keep that?

13:31.942 --> 13:32.812
Yeah. Fortunately, no.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.945
[both laugh]

13:34.945 --> 13:37.317
Nice girdle. You get to keep it?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.919
I'm thinking about it.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.520
- It does make me look slim.
- And sexy.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.992
[chuckles]

13:46.857 --> 13:49.829
I'm really sorry I haven't
called anybody back.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.132
I've been trying to focus
on my rehab, and it's just...

13:52.132 --> 13:53.833
Hey, don't sweat it.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.868
We all just really want to know
how you're doing. That's all.

13:57.868 --> 13:59.309
We all really miss you.

13:59.309 --> 14:02.542
Maybe, if you're feeling up to
it, you could come by The Rock.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.074
I know everyone
would love to see you.

14:04.074 --> 14:06.947
I don't know if
I'll get a chance.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.448
We might be moving
back to Minnesota.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.320
Seriously?

14:10.320 --> 14:12.382
Like, soon?

14:12.382 --> 14:14.925
There's still a lot to work out.

14:14.925 --> 14:18.358
So, probably shouldn't
even be talking about it.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.194
I guess I just
don't have much to say.

14:26.396 --> 14:28.438
About anything.

14:28.438 --> 14:29.900
Well...

14:29.900 --> 14:32.572
That is why I brought these.

14:36.006 --> 14:38.548
- Want to play?
- I guess.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.352
[hip-hop music]

14:56.596 --> 14:57.897
What is that called?

14:58.528 --> 15:00.130
The Tanner.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.532
Or at least it will be when
I land it in a competition.

15:02.532 --> 15:04.134
That's amazing, Lauren.

15:04.134 --> 15:05.505
I've had a lot of time to train,

15:05.505 --> 15:08.438
without the drama
or distractions.

15:08.438 --> 15:10.580
And yet you still managed
to fall on your ass.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.642
I'm sure Kaylie's
asking herself,

15:12.642 --> 15:15.645
"Now that the world has seen the
best Kaylie Cruz has to offer,

15:15.645 --> 15:17.217
what will I do for an encore?"

15:17.217 --> 15:20.220
Oh, I don't know...
I was thinking Olympic gold.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.092
I wouldn't want that pressure.

15:22.092 --> 15:24.624
The target on your back that
comes with being number one.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.156
Having to stay right there,

15:26.156 --> 15:28.328
while Kelly Parker
tries to topple you.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.131
Who needs it?
Look what it did to Payson.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.034
Speaking of Payson.
I saw her last night.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.706
- How is she?
- She's OK, I guess.

15:36.706 --> 15:40.170
She said she's sorry she
hasn't returned anyone's calls.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.241
Hey, you saw Payson?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.473
How's she doing?
Is she in a lot of pain?

15:43.473 --> 15:46.046
You know Payson.
She'd never say.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.119
Yeah. Well, they probably
have her on cortisone.

15:49.119 --> 15:51.681
That's pretty common with
those types of injuries.

15:59.589 --> 16:01.631
[Payson]
I must look like a freak.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.593
No. You look beautiful.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.235
Like always.

16:05.235 --> 16:08.038
So how are you doing? Really?

16:08.038 --> 16:12.702
Great. I ate an entire banana
split yesterday without even
feeling guilty.

16:12.702 --> 16:15.445
Retirement definitely
has its upside.

16:15.445 --> 16:16.746
Come on. Sit down.

16:16.746 --> 16:20.110
Well, I have to admit,
this isn't what I expected.

16:20.110 --> 16:21.411
What do you mean?

16:21.411 --> 16:22.752
The way you're handling it.

16:22.752 --> 16:25.385
You're so, like,
"Everything's cool."

16:25.385 --> 16:27.687
I mean, I try to imagine,
if it was me...

16:27.687 --> 16:29.589
You know, gymnastics
is my whole life.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.362
If I had that taken away
I'd just want to die.

16:35.725 --> 16:36.696
But you...

16:36.696 --> 16:38.198
Payson...

16:38.198 --> 16:40.200
You just might be my hero.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.533
It's so nice of you guys
to spend your lunch break
visiting Payson.

16:43.533 --> 16:44.774
Us guys?

16:44.774 --> 16:46.236
Yeah.
Nicky Russo is in there.

16:46.236 --> 16:48.378
- Oh! Great.
- Go on.

16:48.378 --> 16:50.210
Thanks, Mrs. Keeler.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.583
I know you're probably wondering
about the cortisone.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.785
Yeah, I just feel so guilty.

16:55.785 --> 16:57.217
I can't stop thinking about it.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.389
You couldn't have competed at
Nationals without the cortisone.

16:59.389 --> 17:01.391
You wouldn't have gotten hurt.
It's my fault...

17:01.391 --> 17:03.693
Nicky! It isn't.
I didn't use it.

17:03.693 --> 17:06.096
- What?
- It's OK. I didn't.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.458
I wanted to.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.160
And I started to,
but I just...

17:10.160 --> 17:12.232
I couldn't, so I threw
the vial away.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.264
I still shouldn't
have given it to you.

17:14.264 --> 17:15.705
I could have gotten
you in trouble.

17:15.705 --> 17:18.138
I forged my dad's signature
on the prescription.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.610
You know that's a felony?
Payson, I could go to jail.

17:20.610 --> 17:23.773
Nicky, no one knows.
I threw one vial away in Boston.

17:23.773 --> 17:25.515
And the other one
is in my locker.

17:25.515 --> 17:26.546
Go get it.

17:26.546 --> 17:31.151
My combination is 12-24-36.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.682
[Nicky] Twelve-24-36.

17:32.682 --> 17:34.754
[Payson] You're doing
both of us a huge favor.

17:35.485 --> 17:36.826
Oh, hey, Nicky.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.428
I didn't know you were here.

17:38.428 --> 17:39.729
Yeah, actually,
I was just leaving.

17:40.790 --> 17:47.567
Gotta get back to The Rock.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.169
Well...

17:49.169 --> 17:52.102
You may not have gotten
the gold, but it looks
like you got the guy.

17:52.102 --> 17:53.373
Nice work.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.205
So you don't call anymore?

17:55.205 --> 17:57.447
Sorry.
I've just been really tired.

17:57.447 --> 18:00.250
No, I get it.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.783
It's just I really
miss you, Pay.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.685
The Rock's not
the same without you.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.658
It's really good
to see you, Lauren.

18:08.658 --> 18:11.291
But I've got to get ready
for physical therapy.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.194
So maybe you could
come back another time?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.366
Sure. No problem.

18:16.366 --> 18:18.128
I'll call next time.

18:24.734 --> 18:26.406
[rock music]

18:41.721 --> 18:44.454
I'm asking you to
use your judgment.
Don't load up her plate.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.596
Kaylie's one weakness is
that she's easily distracted.

18:46.596 --> 18:48.428
I'm aware.
I am her manager.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.729
And I'm her coach.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.262
I just think she needs a day
without an interview.

18:52.262 --> 18:54.704
Well, it's too late.
Her first live one is today.

18:54.704 --> 18:59.469
I went to visit Payson.
Nicky was there, too.
Have you been yet?

18:59.469 --> 19:02.242
- No.
- I guess we know
who her real friends are.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.773
I'll get there.

19:05.775 --> 19:08.618
Look who just entered
the no drama zone.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.184
This conversation isn't over.

19:14.184 --> 19:15.755
I wonder what he's doing here?

19:15.755 --> 19:18.288
I have no idea.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.363
[Sasha]
So I'll get to the point.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.464
I'm lifting your suspension.

19:25.295 --> 19:26.466
Really?

19:26.466 --> 19:27.767
[gasps] That's great.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.700
- Thank you.
- Your girlfriend came forward.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.473
She said that she
was as guilty as you,

19:33.473 --> 19:35.775
and deserves to be
suspended as well.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.378
However, since she assured me
that it was over

19:38.378 --> 19:40.950
and would never happen again,
I'm showing leniency.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.253
For you both.

19:43.253 --> 19:44.784
I'm giving you a second chance.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.686
- I appreciate that.
- But keep in mind...

19:46.686 --> 19:49.459
Same thing I told her: the
no-dating rule still applies.

19:49.459 --> 19:51.321
This is your last chance.

19:51.321 --> 19:54.193
She risked a lot to get you back
in here, so don't blow it.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.797
Thank you.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.299
For what?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.670
For going to Sasha.

20:00.670 --> 20:03.503
For risking everything you have
to get me back in The Rock.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.774
Thank you.

20:04.774 --> 20:07.677
I'm sorry, but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.683
- You?
- You deserve to be here.

20:13.683 --> 20:17.587
And no one else was willing
to put themselves on the line
for you.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.296
You told Sasha
about you and Carter?

20:26.296 --> 20:27.427
It was the right thing to do.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.329
- For who?
- For him.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.230
He gave up everything
to protect you.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.263
And you think this makes
you some kind of hero?

20:33.263 --> 20:34.764
No.

20:34.764 --> 20:37.367
But someone needed to do
something to help out Carter.

20:37.367 --> 20:38.368
And...

20:38.368 --> 20:39.609
I am the one who
slept with him.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.773
Kaylie?
It's time for your interview.

20:43.773 --> 20:46.716
I'll be sure to tell Payson
you're thinking about her next
time I visit.

20:46.716 --> 20:48.448
Are you ready?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.920
This is live.
It's great practice.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.282
- Um...
- Kaylie,

20:52.282 --> 20:54.754
I gave you your
schedule this morning.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.626
Yeah, I know, um...

20:56.626 --> 20:58.788
It's just...
really not a good time.

20:58.788 --> 21:00.530
You know what?
The press doesn't care.

21:00.530 --> 21:01.861
You made a commitment.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.534
Now go over there and act
like the champion you are.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.296
[man] So, Kaylie,
how does it feel

21:06.296 --> 21:08.738
to be the Women's
National Gymnastic Champion?

21:08.738 --> 21:09.869
Um...

21:09.869 --> 21:12.602
Good.
It feels good.

21:17.307 --> 21:18.778
You weren't favored to win.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.751
So were you as surprised as the
rest of the world when you did?

21:21.751 --> 21:22.952
Well...

21:24.584 --> 21:26.786
You know,
I trained hard all year...

21:26.786 --> 21:28.788
But, uh...

21:28.788 --> 21:30.520
Yeah, I guess
I was surprised.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.762
[man] Let me ask you
about Payson Keeler.

21:32.762 --> 21:34.724
You've known her since you were
six. You're close friends.

21:34.724 --> 21:35.825
Be honest.

21:35.825 --> 21:37.897
If she hadn't suffered
a career-ending fall

21:37.897 --> 21:40.400
on the second day
of competition,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.502
do you think you
still would have won?

21:43.733 --> 21:45.705
Um... Yeah.

21:48.338 --> 21:50.680
I don't know.

21:52.342 --> 21:53.843
I'm sorry. I just...

21:53.843 --> 21:55.645
I really... I can't do this.

21:55.645 --> 21:56.646
[M.J.] Kaylie!

22:09.359 --> 22:10.730
It's nice. Thank you.

22:13.803 --> 22:18.738
[clears throat] Hey, I'm
sorry I didn't come here
sooner, or call.

22:18.738 --> 22:22.341
It just feels like
M.J.'s got every minute
of my day scheduled.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.613
You know how that is.

22:23.613 --> 22:26.476
No. I never had a manager.

22:28.718 --> 22:29.779
Right.

22:29.779 --> 22:31.521
Well, you know what I mean.

22:31.521 --> 22:34.654
All those things that come
with being number one.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.787
I was never number one.
Not where it counted.

22:42.792 --> 22:43.833
What?

22:43.833 --> 22:46.736
I'm so sorry I haven't
come to see you.

22:46.736 --> 22:49.969
It's not that I've been busy...

22:49.969 --> 22:51.741
Um... It's just...

22:52.702 --> 22:55.745
It should have been you, Payson.

22:55.745 --> 22:57.847
You should have won Nationals
and not me.

22:57.847 --> 23:01.851
And every day I wonder,
did I deserve it?

23:01.851 --> 23:03.983
You know?

23:03.983 --> 23:06.486
And everyone's expecting
me to do it again.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.657
And then the Olympics.

23:07.657 --> 23:09.619
And... What if...?

23:09.619 --> 23:11.561
What if I can't?
What if...?

23:12.792 --> 23:14.494
I'm scared, Pay.

23:15.795 --> 23:19.769
What if I let everybody down?
What should I do?

23:19.769 --> 23:22.031
Nothing. You'll be fine.

23:22.031 --> 23:23.473
You always are.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.478
- Did I do something?
- No.

23:28.478 --> 23:31.410
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
come here sooner. I just...

23:31.410 --> 23:33.483
I mean I didn't
really know what to say.

23:34.884 --> 23:39.819
And everyone's treating me like
I'm this big deal and I'm not.

23:42.121 --> 23:47.557
Just tell me you understand
and you're still my friend.

23:47.557 --> 23:49.799
I need you, Payson.

23:49.799 --> 23:51.701
More than ever.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.805
Honestly, Kaylie,
I'd like to help, but...

23:55.805 --> 23:58.568
I have a few other things
on my mind right now.

24:02.772 --> 24:05.475
Right. I'm sorry.

24:18.758 --> 24:19.959
[crying]

24:19.959 --> 24:21.661
'Night, Kaylie!

24:21.661 --> 24:23.232
Good night.

24:23.232 --> 24:24.764
Well, that can't be good.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.496
I'll go check on Payson.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.139
Everything OK here?

24:30.139 --> 24:32.502
Yeah. Just getting
ready for bed.

24:32.502 --> 24:34.874
OK.

24:34.874 --> 24:38.608
Are you sure? I swear I
just heard Kaylie crying.

24:38.608 --> 24:42.712
You know how dramatic
she gets sometimes.

24:42.712 --> 24:45.915
You know you've had
a rough couple of weeks.

24:45.915 --> 24:47.857
If you need to talk,
your mother and I are...

24:47.857 --> 24:49.659
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

24:49.659 --> 24:51.591
I'm great, actually.

24:56.766 --> 25:00.770
I've always admired the way
you can control your emotions.

25:00.770 --> 25:04.033
I think that's
one of the reasons why...

25:04.033 --> 25:06.005
...you're such a strong
competitor.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.978
You have this ability to take
whatever you're feeling

25:08.978 --> 25:11.981
and put it into a little box
so that it can't distract you.

25:13.783 --> 25:15.945
You put, uh...

25:15.945 --> 25:17.887
Fear into a box.

25:17.887 --> 25:20.149
You can put your insecurities
into another box.

25:20.149 --> 25:23.793
You know, champions,
they can...

25:23.793 --> 25:27.727
Well, they can do that in a way
that the rest of us we just...

25:27.727 --> 25:29.699
We just can't.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.233
You see, the thing is...

25:34.233 --> 25:38.107
...life isn't
a competition, Payson.

25:38.107 --> 25:41.611
It's OK to open
those boxes...

25:41.611 --> 25:43.873
...to feel everything,
the good and the bad.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.246
You've lost something you love.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.848
Let it out.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.825
Good night.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.788
Maybe I'm just like you, Dad.

25:59.789 --> 26:01.661
I've never seen you get...

26:01.661 --> 26:03.933
...angry because you lost
something you loved.

26:10.239 --> 26:11.741
How did you do that?

26:11.741 --> 26:14.343
You know that hospital
they took you to in Boston?

26:14.343 --> 26:17.677
Where the doctors told us
you couldn't compete anymore?

26:17.677 --> 26:19.709
If you know where to look,

26:20.980 --> 26:23.282
you'll find a hole
in the wall.

26:25.014 --> 26:26.656
I put it there.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.121
Good night, Daddy.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.726
Good night, sweetheart.

26:50.079 --> 26:51.080
Damon?

26:54.013 --> 26:56.716
[rock music]

27:19.068 --> 27:20.840
Oh, my gosh. This is...

27:20.840 --> 27:23.673
Welcome to
The Starlight Lounge.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.816
Damon, this is amazing.

27:26.816 --> 27:28.748
I can't believe
you did all of this.

27:28.748 --> 27:33.823
I wanted our last night in
Boulder to be unforgettable.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.855
Do you actually think
I might forget you?

27:37.757 --> 27:40.830
I don't know. Will you?

27:49.769 --> 27:54.373
This is one of the coolest
things that someone
has ever done for me.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.847
I can't believe you've never
been to The Starlight Lounge.

27:57.847 --> 28:01.781
And to discover it just as
you're leaving, what a shame.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.815
I think there's one in LA too.

28:05.815 --> 28:09.859
Same ceiling treatment.

28:09.859 --> 28:11.821
So when you're here,
and I'm there...

28:11.821 --> 28:14.423
We can see the same star.

28:14.423 --> 28:16.025
I saw that movie.

28:17.727 --> 28:19.799
What movie?
I just came up with that.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.034
So what are you thinking about?

28:27.376 --> 28:29.739
I was thinking about
the night we met.

28:29.739 --> 28:32.711
Ah. The kegger by the river.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.713
You were there
with your friends...

28:34.713 --> 28:35.845
I was...

28:35.845 --> 28:38.788
...there with Razor, the band.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.950
So, when you met me
that night...

28:42.391 --> 28:45.454
...could you ever have imagined
us being here, like this, now?

28:45.454 --> 28:47.726
On the world's
most romantic date?

28:48.798 --> 28:50.800
No!

28:50.800 --> 28:53.032
As a matter of fact,
I didn't even like you.

28:56.766 --> 28:58.908
What about you?

28:58.908 --> 29:01.911
Could you have imagined
us here, now?

29:01.911 --> 29:04.143
Yes.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.845
As a matter of fact,
I could.

29:14.824 --> 29:15.825
[clattering]

29:17.056 --> 29:18.988
- What is that?
- I don't know.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.531
It's Payson.
It's Payson!

29:29.368 --> 29:30.940
Wait.

29:32.802 --> 29:34.773
She needs to do this.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.505
She's got to get it all out.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.350
- What's she doing?
- Oh, Becca.

29:49.458 --> 29:52.521
Everything is going to be fine.

29:52.521 --> 29:54.824
Your sister is going to be fine.

29:58.567 --> 30:01.070
When do you leave?

30:01.070 --> 30:02.471
Tomorrow.

30:04.233 --> 30:07.036
It's really cool that you
understand why I'm going...

30:07.036 --> 30:12.311
If anyone understands
doing whatever it takes
for your dream, it's me.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.014
Yeah, some girls, you know,

30:15.014 --> 30:19.118
wouldn't be cool with somebody
that they're getting close to...

30:19.118 --> 30:21.590
...just taking off.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.094
Well, that's not me.

30:25.094 --> 30:26.495
You have to follow your dream.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.560
But I guess some guys,
you know...

30:31.560 --> 30:34.864
...maybe would wonder if
a girl would wait for them.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.907
Well, that's not me.

30:39.138 --> 30:40.870
I could never ask for that.

30:40.870 --> 30:42.471
It's not fair.

30:46.175 --> 30:48.847
I mean, unless we...

30:48.847 --> 30:52.121
You know, decided that...

30:53.622 --> 30:55.854
...making...

30:55.854 --> 30:57.056
Yo, brother!

30:57.056 --> 30:58.857
I saw your car
in the parking lot.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.459
- What is all...
- Razor!

31:00.459 --> 31:02.391
...this about?

31:02.391 --> 31:05.194
Razor. We were just
talking about you.

31:05.194 --> 31:07.937
- Oh?
- What are you doing here?

31:07.937 --> 31:10.869
Like I just said, I saw
your car in the parking lot,

31:10.869 --> 31:14.143
thought you may be
up for a party...

31:14.143 --> 31:15.374
I guess you were.

31:16.906 --> 31:18.307
Yep. This is weird.

31:18.307 --> 31:20.279
Right?

31:20.279 --> 31:21.880
Wow.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.352
Emily.

31:23.352 --> 31:25.554
Damon and Emily.

31:25.554 --> 31:28.587
So... question.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.119
When you checked in,

31:30.119 --> 31:31.620
called me up that midnight
with the munchies,

31:31.620 --> 31:33.892
wondering how
it was all going...

31:33.892 --> 31:36.195
...was there something
you forgot to tell me?

31:36.195 --> 31:38.297
You two have been in touch?

31:38.297 --> 31:41.900
We talked once or twice.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.572
- I thought you hadn't.
- We have.

31:43.572 --> 31:45.904
Oh, wow.
I really have to go.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.977
No, Emily, please stay.

31:47.977 --> 31:50.339
Look, Damon,

31:50.339 --> 31:51.981
it's Emily Kmetko.

31:51.981 --> 31:53.682
The girl you said you were going
to keep your eye out for.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.586
- How's it going, Emily?
- Great.

31:57.586 --> 32:00.049
- That's great.
- What have you been up to?

32:00.049 --> 32:02.091
I just got back from
a couple months on the road...

32:02.091 --> 32:03.953
As a roadie.

32:05.594 --> 32:10.459
You two enjoy this whole little
festive scene you got going on.

32:10.459 --> 32:14.133
I am going to exit
my bad self...

32:14.133 --> 32:15.504
...stage left.

32:15.504 --> 32:17.036
Check you guys later.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.109
I'm going to Los Angeles
for a bit.

32:22.571 --> 32:25.074
- Really?
- I thought I told you.

32:26.245 --> 32:28.377
Damon sold
some of his songs!

32:28.377 --> 32:29.648
Wow. You did?

32:29.648 --> 32:31.981
That's very cool, Damon.

32:31.981 --> 32:34.523
So you are going to LA.

32:34.523 --> 32:36.525
And I am here with Emily.

32:37.987 --> 32:40.359
Anybody else seeing
the irony in this situation?

32:43.492 --> 32:44.563
Peace, Emily.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.965
I will see you at the Shack.

32:48.037 --> 32:49.668
Bye, Razor.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.172
Damon?

32:53.172 --> 32:55.444
We should go.

32:55.444 --> 32:57.006
Was there something
you wanted to...?

32:57.006 --> 32:59.648
It's late.
Did you have a jacket?

33:13.422 --> 33:15.224
[Payson] What are you
doing with those?

33:15.224 --> 33:17.066
Fixing them.

33:17.066 --> 33:19.068
Becca, it's time to go.

33:19.068 --> 33:20.699
- Can you get in the car?
- OK.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.575
[Kim] How are you
feeling this morning?

33:26.575 --> 33:28.577
- Better.
- Better?

33:28.577 --> 33:30.539
I think I feel...

33:32.611 --> 33:35.044
- Better.
- "Better" is good.

33:35.044 --> 33:38.217
It's much better than "great."

33:38.217 --> 33:40.449
You had me worried.

33:40.449 --> 33:42.291
You've been through so much.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.195
Does it bother you

33:46.195 --> 33:49.598
when you see me take
Becca to The Rock?

33:49.598 --> 33:51.530
Not if that's what she wants.

33:55.264 --> 33:56.535
What about you?

33:56.535 --> 33:58.807
What do you want?

33:58.807 --> 34:02.571
Do you really want to move
back to Minnesota?

34:02.571 --> 34:06.675
No. I just know that it
hurts so much to be here.

34:06.675 --> 34:10.719
And that it kills me
to think about ever

34:10.719 --> 34:13.352
even stepping foot
in The Rock.

34:13.352 --> 34:14.423
Why?

34:15.724 --> 34:17.726
Because it's everything
I'll never have again.

34:20.789 --> 34:22.431
I love you, Payson.

34:22.431 --> 34:24.733
And I know you're
in a lot of pain.

34:24.733 --> 34:26.365
But you are so wrong.

34:26.365 --> 34:31.140
The Rock is everything
you'll always have.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.172
- [groans]
- It's maturity.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.773
It's discipline.

34:34.773 --> 34:35.774
It's knowledge.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.147
It's taking risks.

34:38.147 --> 34:41.710
It's trying.
It's always trying.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.652
It's being a champion in life.

34:43.652 --> 34:46.715
And you learned all of it
at The Rock.

34:46.715 --> 34:50.289
And you'll always have it.
And you'll always be it.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.860
I don't feel like that.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.662
I don't feel like anything.

34:53.662 --> 34:55.764
I can never compete again.

34:55.764 --> 34:58.827
No, you can't.

34:58.827 --> 35:00.369
And that's a terrible thing.

35:00.369 --> 35:02.601
But there's so much
you can do.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.234
You have community,
family, friends.

35:05.234 --> 35:07.105
You still have that.

35:08.137 --> 35:09.838
You didn't lose that.

35:40.209 --> 35:41.710
You going to be OK
with me being here?

35:41.710 --> 35:44.643
I plan on staying so focused
I'll barely even notice you.

35:46.415 --> 35:47.416
Good.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.622
I guess I should say thank you.

35:53.622 --> 35:55.254
I guess you should.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.885
But, considering everything,

35:56.885 --> 35:58.787
I think you'll
understand if I don't.

35:59.928 --> 36:01.390
[Chloe] Why the long face?

36:01.390 --> 36:03.792
Damon's catching a bus
to LA tonight.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.894
And it all just ended
kind of weird.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.798
Weird how?

36:09.798 --> 36:11.740
I said I couldn't
ask him to stay

36:11.740 --> 36:14.673
and he said he couldn't
ask me to wait.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.345
Oh, honey.

36:16.345 --> 36:18.707
That's the worst
goodbye I ever heard.

36:20.709 --> 36:22.811
Did you want him
to ask you?

36:22.811 --> 36:24.213
Yeah.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.285
I really did.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.656
Well, then you
have to go tell him.

36:28.717 --> 36:30.889
No. I can't.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.521
Well, would you
rather him think

36:32.521 --> 36:35.664
that something sparky-sparky
was going on with you and Razor?

36:35.664 --> 36:37.566
Huh?

36:45.774 --> 36:47.576
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:47.576 --> 36:48.737
How's Payson doing?

36:48.737 --> 36:51.440
I can honestly say better.
I think.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.781
Well, you're all in my prayers.

36:52.781 --> 36:54.313
Thank you.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.319
Sasha thinks I should fill in
for you while you're on leave.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.821
I'm willing to do it,
but only with your blessing.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.752
Oh. You have it.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.974
[Kim] I'm sorry to hear
about your engagement.

37:25.974 --> 37:26.975
Oh! Don't be.

37:26.975 --> 37:28.647
It's for the best.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.819
Do you guys think you
could ever work it out?

37:30.819 --> 37:31.820
No.

37:33.382 --> 37:34.753
There is nothing
that Steve Tanner

37:34.753 --> 37:36.425
could ever do
to make up for...

37:37.526 --> 37:39.658
Um, to change my mind.

37:43.832 --> 37:45.964
Are you expecting Payson?

38:23.632 --> 38:25.804
Payson.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.636
I've been waiting for you.

38:27.636 --> 38:31.039
It's OK that I came?

38:31.039 --> 38:33.782
Champions are always
welcome here.

38:36.645 --> 38:38.487
What do you say, people?

38:38.487 --> 38:40.619
How do we greet
a returning champion?

38:40.619 --> 38:41.620
[applauding]

38:57.406 --> 38:58.807
Glad you're back.

39:10.118 --> 39:11.950
It's so good
to see you back here.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.852
- We've all missed you...
- Don't!

39:15.684 --> 39:17.486
Don't. This is...

39:17.486 --> 39:19.127
This is really hard for me.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.130
I am...

39:22.130 --> 39:25.834
...so angry at you
right now.

39:25.834 --> 39:28.697
I am filled with rage
and bitterness and jealousy.

39:28.697 --> 39:31.540
And it is killing me
because you're my friend.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.942
And I love you. And...

39:33.942 --> 39:36.405
...you don't deserve
what I'm feeling.

39:36.405 --> 39:37.906
What did I do?

39:40.108 --> 39:41.780
You won.

39:45.083 --> 39:49.688
For as long as I've known you,
you've had everything.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.820
You're popular.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.492
You're pretty.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.793
You have money.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.895
Boys like you.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.768
And I've been OK with that
because...

39:59.768 --> 40:01.800
The only thing that ever
really mattered to me...

40:01.800 --> 40:05.704
The only thing I wanted
was to win.

40:05.704 --> 40:06.975
I didn't have to feel jealous,

40:06.975 --> 40:08.807
because I was going to be
the National champion.

40:08.807 --> 40:12.180
I was going to be the winner.
And then...

40:14.443 --> 40:17.486
And then you took that too.

40:17.486 --> 40:20.649
And now I'll just...
I'll never know.

40:20.649 --> 40:21.750
I'm sorry.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.552
- You have no idea.
- No!

40:23.552 --> 40:27.696
Don't you dare be sorry.
Never be sorry for winning.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.530
I'm serious Kaylie.

40:33.902 --> 40:36.765
I just need to know.

40:36.765 --> 40:38.707
Are we going to be OK?

40:39.838 --> 40:42.641
I really don't know.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.073
But I'm trying.

40:45.073 --> 40:47.115
And at least you know
what I'm feeling now.

40:47.115 --> 40:48.777
You deserve that.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.483
I better get back inside.

40:56.785 --> 40:57.926
One more thing.

41:00.529 --> 41:01.590
Listen to me, Kaylie.

41:01.590 --> 41:04.563
You're the National champion.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.835
You. Don't ever forget it.

41:06.835 --> 41:10.138
Don't ever apologize for it.

41:10.138 --> 41:12.801
You beat Kelly Parker.

41:12.801 --> 41:14.202
And if you can do it once,

41:14.202 --> 41:16.575
you're the one
that can do it again.

41:18.146 --> 41:20.478
Next time you doubt yourself,
just remember that.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.952
Thank you.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.787
[Lauren] It's not in there.

41:58.787 --> 42:00.819
But don't worry,

42:00.819 --> 42:02.891
I put it in a safe place.

42:02.891 --> 42:06.555
We wouldn't want anyone
to find out about the
cortisone, would we?

42:10.829 --> 42:11.730
What do you want?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.702
We'll see.

42:15.133 --> 42:18.867
[woman] Last call, express
service to Los Angeles.

42:18.867 --> 42:21.309
Ready for departure.

42:21.309 --> 42:24.873
Express service bus
to Los Angeles.

42:38.857 --> 42:42.731
Remember when you said you
couldn't ask me to wait for you?

42:42.731 --> 42:43.732
Yeah.

42:43.732 --> 42:45.233
I want you to.

42:46.294 --> 42:47.766
Ask me.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.698
Ask me! Come on,
I'm late for work!

42:49.698 --> 42:50.769
Ask me right now!

42:52.701 --> 42:54.172
Emily, will you wait for me?

42:55.944 --> 42:57.676
Yes.
