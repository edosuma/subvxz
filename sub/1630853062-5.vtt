Oh, sorry.

Saturday for once,

08:54.708 --> 08:56.492
so I thought maybe you...
[phone buzzing]

08:56.536 --> 08:59.887
And I could, um...

08:59.930 --> 09:02.193
This better be an emergency.
- It is.

09:02.237 --> 09:05.457
There's been a murder,
because I'm killing it.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.285
Now, that's what I call
job security.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.679
- Oh, my God, Tommy,
I don't care.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.333
- Neil said that the city
was lucky to have me,

09:11.376 --> 09:14.989
and I just want to assure you
that I don't want your job.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.599
- Uh, yeah,
I'm not worried about that.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.253
- Why are you never
threatened by me?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.951
I'm smart and I'm ambitious
and I am working on my posture.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.301
- I got to handle this.
Someone at DWP clicked

09:23.345 --> 09:24.520
a bad link,
and now there's sewage

09:24.564 --> 09:25.913
coming up people's toilets.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.871
- Oh.
[chuckles]

09:27.915 --> 09:30.308
Wait, was that my shot?

09:30.352 --> 09:31.701
That wasn't my shot.

09:31.745 --> 09:34.443
That wasn't it.
Arpi?

09:34.486 --> 09:36.532
[glass clinks]

09:36.576 --> 09:41.145
- I just want to thank all
of you for being here today.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.973
I always wanted
to have a sister,

09:43.017 --> 09:46.237
and now I've got six.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.632
[laughs]

09:49.676 --> 09:51.155
Right.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.375
I want to talk about
how we can help each other.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.986
- Oh, so true.
I mean, think about it.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.988
Me and this guy, same height,

09:58.032 --> 10:00.512
doesn't mean we're going out
for the same things.

I'm here for you.

10:05.996 --> 10:09.260
There's no reason we shouldn't
be sharing resources.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.567
Let's talk
about transportation.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.438

on transpo.

10:13.482 --> 10:18.052

I'm really excited

10:21.359 --> 10:23.753
to help develop,
and that's the bullet train.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.930
- The "Bullet Train"?
The Brad Pitt movie?

10:26.974 --> 10:28.540
It's out already.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.107
- This guy's crazy.

10:30.151 --> 10:33.415
- I know you guys have honed
that technology in Japan.

10:34.285 --> 10:39.029
- Oh, my God, is this real?
I'm six days sober.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.205
- Oh, my--oh, I am so sorry.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.511
Tommy, don't let him leave.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.469
We got to be part
of this bullet train thing.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.689
- It's too late.
That project's over.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.908
- It is?

10:47.951 --> 10:49.692
- Yeah, you got to read
the blogs, guy.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.651
- Susan,
thank you for seeing us.

10:51.694 --> 10:54.131
I am well aware
of the one-ask policy

10:54.175 --> 10:55.480
for interoffice romance.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.700
I respect it.
I respect you.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.615
- Okay, what happened?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.704
- Okay, so you know
who James Aniobi is, right?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.097
Good face, skin like silk,

11:03.140 --> 11:04.881
hard to tell under the suit
but the bod seems tight.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.883
- Not okay,
but I know who you mean.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.668
- Okay, so I went
to ask him out once,

11:08.711 --> 11:10.626
but I only got, like,
3/4 of the way through

11:10.670 --> 11:11.758
and we got interrupted.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.542
I never actually finished
the question,

11:13.585 --> 11:15.500
so that doesn't count
as my ask, right?

11:15.544 --> 11:17.372
- Hmm.
Interesting.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.721
- It was a checked swing,
Susan.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.680
Her bat did not
cross the plate.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.247
Ball one.
- What exactly did you say?

11:23.291 --> 11:25.859
- I said,
"I'm also free Saturday,

11:25.902 --> 11:28.992
and maybe you and I could,"
and then I got cut off.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.080
- How's that a question?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.429
Her voice didn't go up
at the end.

11:31.473 --> 11:33.605
- Well, you definitely started
asking him out.

11:33.649 --> 11:34.868
- But she could've been
about to say anything.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.913
"Maybe you and I
could not go to dinner."

11:36.957 --> 11:38.567

could each contribute

11:43.877 --> 11:46.575
Ms. Shaw, your language
was vague.

11:46.618 --> 11:49.012
And since the other case
on my desk is a guy

11:49.056 --> 11:51.058

his female coworkers' bellies

11:51.101 --> 11:53.147

11:53.190 --> 11:57.020
I am desperate for any example
of positive human interaction.

11:57.064 --> 11:59.153
So you get one more ask.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.589
- Yes.
- Rock and roll.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.245
Was I on that tummy list?

12:04.288 --> 12:05.376

the mayors are weird.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.302
What did you do?

12:18.346 --> 12:20.565
- Well, they seem normal to me,
but you know mayors.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.437
Look, I'm sorry I haven't
gotten them there yet.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.787
Turns out, this vehicle
isn't allowed on the highway,

12:24.831 --> 12:26.484

a motorcycle police lady.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.877
- Wait,
what are you talking about?

12:27.921 --> 12:29.400
- I'm saying that
I had to take side streets,

12:29.444 --> 12:30.750
which means turning,

12:30.793 --> 12:33.143
and this is more
of a go-straight car.

- Ah, chlamydia's not so bad.

What you should be
worried about is the fact

12:42.022 --> 12:44.851
that Y2K did happen
and this is all a simulation.

Jayden, get them here now.

spill out of the hot tub.

White mayors read as villains.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.153
- Tommy,
where are the real mayors?

17:04.197 --> 17:05.676
- You know that strip mall
on La Brea

17:05.720 --> 17:06.938
with the foot-shaped sign
that used to say "Foot Doctor"

17:06.982 --> 17:08.070
and now it says "Day Care"?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
- Dan, get the car.
Tommy, come here.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.943
- Sorry.
- You knew this?

17:13.293 --> 17:14.337
- Oh, what's up?

17:14.381 --> 17:15.599
You got more garbage
in your hair?

17:15.643 --> 17:17.862
- [laughs]
Okay.

17:17.906 --> 17:21.649
Um, yeah,
I was just--I was wondering

17:21.692 --> 17:25.870
if you would maybe like
to get dinner on Saturday.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.785
- Like a date?

17:27.829 --> 17:29.613
- Like a date.

17:29.657 --> 17:30.701
- Right.

17:30.745 --> 17:35.228
Well, I would love to...
say yes,

17:35.271 --> 17:37.447
but I can't.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.842
- Oh, you can't.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.191
Oh, cool, cool.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.975
Cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.978
I, um--yeah, I can't either.

17:47.022 --> 17:51.331
I just remembered, Saturday,
that's when "SNL" is on.

17:51.374 --> 17:54.073
It's a rerun, but Drake--

17:54.116 --> 17:56.640
it's always fun to see
that side of him.

17:56.684 --> 18:02.168
So I'm busy, but anyways,
thank you for your hospitality.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.084
Okay.
[laughs]

18:07.086 --> 18:10.219
- It's--it's--
- Okay.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.353
[sighs]

18:15.746 --> 18:16.095
.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.053
- What is that?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.795
Oh, please don't hit me.

18:20.838 --> 18:24.015
- City Hall has access
to so many cars.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.409
What is this?
- I wanted it to be special.

18:26.453 --> 18:28.411
And the guys
at Cars of Stars Rentals

18:28.455 --> 18:31.110
said that this
just screams Los Angeles,

18:31.153 --> 18:33.024
which it does
if you use the horn.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.287
I think it's
David Lee Roth's voice.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.897
- Jayden, where are the mayors?

18:35.940 --> 18:37.681
- They disappeared
into the mall.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.248
Am I gonna be executed?

18:39.292 --> 18:41.163
- Yeah, this is worse
than what I did, right, sir?

18:41.207 --> 18:43.034
I'm in less trouble
than Jayden because--

18:43.078 --> 18:46.342
- Jayden, my friend.
[laughs]

18:46.386 --> 18:50.912
- Gentlemen, ma'am,
I am so, so sorry.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.567
Oh, I see you got T-shirts.

18:53.610 --> 18:54.916
- Oh, and so much more.

18:54.959 --> 18:58.049
We got pizza,
excellent omakase,

18:58.093 --> 19:00.051
a lunchtime face-lift.

19:00.095 --> 19:03.229
Then we had CBD brownies.
[laughter]

19:03.272 --> 19:05.535
I had copies
of all my keys made.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.799
And then a truck full of tacos
just appeared.

19:08.843 --> 19:11.759
- And I got my nails, uh, did.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.064
Am I saying that correctly?

19:13.108 --> 19:14.414
- Actually, you are.
- Oh!

19:14.457 --> 19:17.068
- And this guy,
what a tour guide.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.896
[laughter]

19:18.940 --> 19:21.986
- Well, this was the plan.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.336
Welcome to LA.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.077
Hey, why don't we head back
to Getty House

19:26.121 --> 19:27.470
and then talk turkey?

19:27.514 --> 19:30.212
- The Turks?
They are animals.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.258
- Well, you know, I didn't--
- I'm kidding.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.173
I know what you mean.
[laughter]

19:34.216 --> 19:36.914
I'm a little high.
- It happens.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.916
All right, let's take my car,
shall we?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.222
Here we go.
- Thank you.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.224
- Welcome to LA.
- Yeah.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.399
Hey, Tommy.
- Yeah?

19:43.443 --> 19:45.140
- Jayden's gonna ride with us.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.273
I know you don't want
to burden me with problems,

19:47.316 --> 19:49.057
so why don't you solve that

19:49.100 --> 19:51.451
and then tell me
how you did it afterwards?

19:53.017 --> 19:54.323
- Oh, here.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.287
- Nice parking job, you idiot.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.247
- "I can't"?
What does "I can't" even mean?

20:05.291 --> 20:06.553
"I can't because I'm busy"?

20:06.596 --> 20:07.945
"I can't
because I love you so much

20:07.989 --> 20:09.208
and I'm scared
of disappointing you"?

20:09.251 --> 20:10.905
- Look, this was fun before,

20:10.948 --> 20:13.429
but someone recorded themselves
pulling it out on Zoom, so...

20:13.473 --> 20:15.431
- But can I have
a follow-up ask, "Why not?"

20:15.475 --> 20:17.607
'Cause right before he said,
"I can't,"

20:17.651 --> 20:19.348
his eyes were like...

20:19.392 --> 20:23.004
and I could tell, inside,
he was kind of like...

20:23.047 --> 20:24.788
- His words didn't match
his eyes.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.529
They were inviting,

20:26.573 --> 20:28.879
like a piping-hot stew
in a blizzard.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.665
- Okay, Mikaela, I want you
to think about the last time

20:31.708 --> 20:33.971
someone made an unwanted
advance toward you.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.712
- Richard Dreyfuss
at baggage claim.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.932
- And would have appreciated
a "Why not?"

20:37.975 --> 20:39.281
Would that have sat well?

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
- [groans]
Yeah, I see your point.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.980
He did do that, by the way.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.286
- I'm sorry, kid.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.810
If you like,
I'll help you steal

20:46.854 --> 20:49.726
James' cologne so you can
spray it on a body pillow.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.162
- Please do not do that.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.294
- Or maybe we could set you up

20:52.338 --> 20:53.730
with whoever whipped it out
on Zoom.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.471
- Actually, she's married.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.560
- Yeah.
