- See, for the last week
or so--

19:51.064 --> 19:53.775
- [gasps] Look!
- [scoffs]

19:53.859 --> 19:55.193
- Get him!

19:55.277 --> 19:57.029
- Why should I even try?

19:57.112 --> 19:58.655
He's brilliant.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.198
I mean, even if I had
a super--

20:00.282 --> 20:03.160
- There, rat captured.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.578
Toss me that Blitz.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.664
- Zoey, that was genius!

20:07.748 --> 20:08.206
- Whatever.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.418
- Hey.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.794
- Hey, Chase.
- Hey.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.881
- Listen, Zo,
sorry I freaked out on you...

20:15.964 --> 20:18.258
back there near the bush.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.676
- Yeah, what was that about?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.137
- I just--

20:22.221 --> 20:24.264
I guess it's just kind of hard
for me to understand

20:24.348 --> 20:26.892
why you would want to date a guy
like Logan.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.977
- Date him?
You think I'm dating Logan?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.313
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.606
- Aren't you?

20:32.689 --> 20:35.817
- No! Gross! Ew!
Why would you think that?

20:35.901 --> 20:36.777
- 'Cause you guys
have been sneaking around.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.613
- And lying about it.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.865
- And Logan told me
you were.

20:41.949 --> 20:42.824
[chuckles]

20:42.908 --> 20:44.451
- I am not dating Logan!

20:44.534 --> 20:46.328
He's tutoring me in chemistry.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.165
- Chemistry?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.001
[girls laughing]

20:53.085 --> 20:54.461
- Oh, my God, Logan?

20:54.544 --> 20:56.296
Logan, seriously?

20:57.714 --> 20:59.341
- Oh, that's not true.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.676
- Oh, it's true.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.552
Logan is one of my best
chemistry students,

21:02.636 --> 21:04.805
which is why I asked him
to tutor Zoey.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.181
- See?

21:06.264 --> 21:08.517
- Is that really your hair?

21:08.600 --> 21:09.726
- Yes?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.603
- I doubt it.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.523
- See?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.525
- Okay.
- We believe you.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.068
- So why'd Logan lie?

21:18.151 --> 21:19.486
- 'Cause he thought everyone
would rip on him

21:19.569 --> 21:20.862
for being a chemistry geek.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.447
- Oh, yeah,
we'll definitely do that.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.074
- Yeah, that's for sure.
- We totally are, though.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.326
- I can't believe he said
we were dating. Ugh!

21:26.410 --> 21:28.161
- You should get him back
somehow.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.663
- Yeah, you should.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.046

Wow.

would have believed

22:25.218 --> 22:28.138
Logan Reese knows chemistry.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.639
- He does, big-time.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.308
- And he's really good at it?

22:31.391 --> 22:32.434

your level,

22:32.517 --> 22:34.102

notice the rat in his pants?
