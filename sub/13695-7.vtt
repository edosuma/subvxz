00:10.462 --> 00:13.799
DONALD: "Dearest Molly,
greetings from the Highlands.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.510
"I trust this letter
finds you in good health.

00:16.593 --> 00:18.679
"Life here is, as ever,

00:19.471 --> 00:22.641
"busy, busy, busy.

00:22.724 --> 00:24.518
"But what of the rest
of the family?

00:24.601 --> 00:28.272
"Well, our young laird is
capable enough, obviously,

00:28.355 --> 00:32.734
-"but he seems
a touch preoccupied,
-(GROANS)

00:32.818 --> 00:37.281
"which I suppose
is an inevitable consequence
of bachelorhood,

00:37.364 --> 00:40.784
"at his age, if not at mine.
(CHUCKLES)

00:40.868 --> 00:45.497
"Indeed, I'm beginning to feel
something of an elder
statesman at Glenbogle.

00:45.581 --> 00:49.501
"What with your good self
otherwise engaged in
the Antipodes.

00:49.585 --> 00:52.838
"And the ghillie and his
lady friend off exploring
the fleshpots

00:52.921 --> 00:55.757
"of the west coast,
such as they are.

00:55.841 --> 00:57.551
"As the saying goes,

00:57.634 --> 01:01.054
"the ravens have
left the tower.

01:01.138 --> 01:04.266
"Naturally, young Jess is
coping manfully

01:04.349 --> 01:06.894
"with the day-to-day business
of the estate,

01:06.977 --> 01:11.607
"but I'm sure she's relieved
to have an experienced
presence on hand,

01:11.690 --> 01:13.942
"should any problem arise.

01:14.026 --> 01:16.945
"To date, however,
I am happy to report

01:17.029 --> 01:19.114
"that all is well."

01:19.698 --> 01:20.991
Poachers.

01:57.986 --> 02:01.156
Well, we've always
had poachers.
You know, mainly locals.

02:01.239 --> 02:05.369
But we're not talking about
pinching a grouse
for the family pot.

02:05.452 --> 02:07.287
These are organised gangs.

02:07.371 --> 02:09.747
They go for a deer,
flog it to meat traders
and restaurants.

02:09.832 --> 02:11.917
Well, how many animals
have we lost?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.753
There were entrails
in three different places,
about a mile or so apart.

02:14.837 --> 02:16.380
Entrails?

02:16.463 --> 02:18.423
They gut them on the spot.

02:18.507 --> 02:21.510
-Can you handle this, Jess?
-You sound like my dad.

02:21.593 --> 02:25.722
-No, no, this is serious.
-I know it is
and I know what I'm doing.

02:25.806 --> 02:28.058
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

02:35.232 --> 02:36.732
Not bad, eh?

02:36.817 --> 02:38.777
It's fantastic!

02:38.861 --> 02:40.487
I know you've been
all around the world...

02:40.571 --> 02:44.031
Yeah, I have. So now when
I go somewhere

02:44.116 --> 02:47.286
I can tell instantly
if I'm going to like it.

02:47.369 --> 02:49.580
And you like it here?

02:49.663 --> 02:51.123
Love it!

02:51.206 --> 02:54.376
Now, come on, enough talking.

02:54.458 --> 02:57.254
-Get 'em off.
-I beg your pardon?

02:57.337 --> 02:59.965
-A bit of a paddle.
-Oh, right.

03:00.048 --> 03:02.843
I was not suggesting
that we go skinny dipping.

03:02.926 --> 03:04.303
Dearie me, no.

03:04.386 --> 03:08.182
Because we need to wait
until after dark for that.

03:12.436 --> 03:16.398
-A little snack. (CHUCKLES)
-Don't come running
to me when you get gout.

03:16.482 --> 03:18.650
If I get gout, I won't be
running anywhere, will I?

03:18.734 --> 03:20.235
I'm gonna need some of that,
Ewan.

03:20.319 --> 03:22.279
How come you've all got
hollow legs all of a sudden?

03:22.362 --> 03:24.656
I need lunch to go,
quick as you can, okay?

03:24.740 --> 03:26.200
What's the big emergency?

03:26.283 --> 03:29.244
-JESS: Someone's been
poaching on the estate.
-No way!

03:29.328 --> 03:31.497
Boy! To the gun rack.

03:31.580 --> 03:35.501
My brother Hector kept
a particularly trusty shotgun
for just such occasions.

03:35.584 --> 03:37.669
You can't go blazing away
at people.

03:37.753 --> 03:40.297
I don't consider these
lowlifes as people.

03:40.380 --> 03:41.840
-Donald.
-Yes?

03:42.841 --> 03:44.301
With my dad away,

03:44.384 --> 03:46.553
this is my responsibility

03:46.637 --> 03:49.389
and I am going
to deal with it.

03:49.473 --> 03:50.849
Understood?

03:52.518 --> 03:54.978
I said, understood?

03:56.063 --> 03:57.439
Understood.

03:58.607 --> 03:59.733
Good.

04:10.994 --> 04:13.539
How much?

04:13.622 --> 04:17.375
I said I wanted
the washing machine fixed,
not gold-plated.

04:17.459 --> 04:21.588
Fine, fine. Look, send me
the bill, but try keeping it
to one page, all right?

04:25.217 --> 04:27.302
-Hi, Delia.
-Hiya.

04:27.386 --> 04:29.179
If you're uh, busy,
I can come back.

04:29.263 --> 04:32.683
-No, it's all right. Come in.
-Mmm, something smells good.

04:32.766 --> 04:33.976
Can I try a bit?

04:34.059 --> 04:35.894
It's not quite ready.

04:37.229 --> 04:38.939
Mmm!

04:39.022 --> 04:40.858
Oh, that's delicious.

04:40.941 --> 04:42.568
My gran's special recipe.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.862
It's gorgeous.

04:45.904 --> 04:47.906
I mean...tasty.

04:50.784 --> 04:52.494
You should think
about selling it.

04:52.578 --> 04:55.164
Your family recipe,
Glenbogle name on the jar.

04:55.247 --> 04:57.958
Loads of places do
that kind of thing.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.002
-Never really thought
about that.
-Mmm.

05:00.085 --> 05:03.922
Well, lucky for you, I can be
the brains of the operation.

05:04.006 --> 05:07.134
And a bit of extra money
coming in never hurts,
does it?

05:07.217 --> 05:08.969
So many farms fail these days.

05:10.387 --> 05:13.223
Are you saying that
I'm a failure?

05:13.307 --> 05:16.226
No, but you're
obviously struggling.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.645
I know I'm behind
with the rent,
but just by a month.

05:18.729 --> 05:21.899
Um, two, actually,
but don't worry about it.

05:21.982 --> 05:24.318
Tell you what...

05:24.401 --> 05:28.280
-Let me write you a cheque.
-Isobel, I don't want
your money.

05:28.363 --> 05:32.951
-Why not?
-No. I mean, we can
work something out.

05:33.035 --> 05:35.996
-You're not just any tenant,
are you?
-What do you mean by that?

05:36.079 --> 05:38.791
Well, you know what I mean.

05:38.874 --> 05:41.251
-You were there as well.
-And?

05:41.335 --> 05:43.253
And... And that changes
things between us.

05:44.546 --> 05:46.632
-Doesn't it?
-So, one little kiss

05:46.715 --> 05:48.383
and I don't need to pay
you rent any more?

05:48.467 --> 05:51.303
Well, it was more
than a little kiss.

05:51.386 --> 05:53.764
So, what are you gonna do?
Take payment in kind?

05:53.847 --> 05:55.390
"Eh, love, I don't need
your brass,

05:55.474 --> 05:58.477
"we can work something out."
Nudge, nudge.
After one little kiss.

05:58.560 --> 06:02.022
Well, I'll make sure it
doesn't happen again,
then...love.

06:04.608 --> 06:07.903
Reward? Exactly what sort of
figures are we talking about?

06:07.986 --> 06:09.988
You're not involved, remember?

06:10.072 --> 06:13.200
No, no, but I do take
the occasional constitutional
in the grounds,

06:13.283 --> 06:16.120
-and if I were to come across
some evidence...
-No, Donald.

06:16.203 --> 06:20.124
Or even accidentally bump
into the gang and give them
a bit of a hiding.

06:20.207 --> 06:21.959
No, Donald.

06:22.042 --> 06:24.545
There's not going to be
any physical violence
against the poachers.

06:24.628 --> 06:26.505
Because you're a girl?

06:27.548 --> 06:30.717
No, because there are laws.

06:30.801 --> 06:32.594
We are not allowed
to use force.

06:32.678 --> 06:34.805
It's a world gone mad.

06:34.888 --> 06:37.599
-We ready to go?
-We?

06:37.683 --> 06:39.393
-I thought I was
handling this.
-Yeah, you are,

06:39.476 --> 06:42.437
but I'm coming with you.
I'm in the mood for a ruck.
Now, come on.

06:42.521 --> 06:46.441
Perhaps you should tell
the laird about your
softly-softly approach.

06:46.525 --> 06:47.860
Thank you.

07:07.212 --> 07:09.631
"Anti poacher shells.

07:09.715 --> 07:11.341
"Hector MacDonald."

07:11.800 --> 07:13.093
Yes!

07:27.191 --> 07:29.485
(BUZZING)

07:29.568 --> 07:31.195
I think they might've
heard you by now, Paul.

07:31.278 --> 07:35.324
Oh, not if they're any
like the last lot.
She was as deaf as a...

07:35.407 --> 07:38.535
-Post.
-Tell me you're here
to install the satellite dish.

07:38.619 --> 07:41.455
-Yeah... No.
-Jacuzzi, then?

07:41.538 --> 07:42.790
Now, that does
sound tempting...

07:42.873 --> 07:44.124
We're actually from Glenbogle.

07:46.418 --> 07:48.420
The estate that backs
on to this one.

07:48.504 --> 07:52.257
Oh, right, and this is you
being neighbourly.
That's uh, that's very kind.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.885
Thanks, boys.

07:54.968 --> 07:57.970
-Well, uh, sadly, there's more
to it than that.
-There's been some

07:58.055 --> 08:00.390
-poaching going on the area.
-Really?

08:00.474 --> 08:02.267
Here or just over
at Glenwhatsit?

08:02.351 --> 08:03.852
That's what we need
to find out.

08:03.936 --> 08:05.729
I'm the acting ghillie
and this is...

08:05.813 --> 08:08.315
Right, in that case you need
to talk to Stuart.

08:08.397 --> 08:11.235
He's the gamekeeper.
He'll know much more
about it than I do.

08:11.318 --> 08:13.987
The sale went through
last week and uh,
to be honest it's

08:14.071 --> 08:16.532
been a bit of a rush
even getting the basics
sorted out.

08:16.615 --> 08:19.535
It must be, uh, must be hell
without a satellite dish.

08:20.911 --> 08:22.830
I'm surviving, but only just.

08:25.707 --> 08:28.460
Look, speak to Stuart
and if it needs to go
to a higher level

08:28.544 --> 08:30.629
have your laird call me.
Lucy Ford.

08:30.712 --> 08:33.090
-Well, I'm Paul. I'm the...
-It's lovely to meet you,

08:33.173 --> 08:35.467
but I really do have
to get on.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.304
(CHUCKLES)

08:39.388 --> 08:42.850
So, do you know
this Stuart bloke?
Any use?

08:42.933 --> 08:45.394
Yeah. Yeah, his dad was
a ghillie, too.

08:45.477 --> 08:48.313
-Mate of my dad's.
-STUART: Hello there.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.274
Golly's little lassie.

08:54.903 --> 08:57.280
Patience, lass, patience.

08:57.364 --> 08:59.950
That's the key
when it comes to the fishing.

09:00.032 --> 09:02.243
Is that right? (CLICKS TONGUE)

09:02.327 --> 09:06.081
So, you mean I
can't just go...

09:06.165 --> 09:07.499
Like this!

09:08.083 --> 09:09.793
Hey-ey!

09:09.877 --> 09:12.754
Well, you have been saying
I should try some sushi.

09:12.838 --> 09:16.300
I'll take you for some
proper sushi
one of these days.

09:16.383 --> 09:20.262
Of course, for the really
good stuff you need
to go to Tokyo.

09:20.345 --> 09:21.513
Tokyo?

09:23.056 --> 09:24.892
You must miss it, though,

09:24.975 --> 09:27.102
the travelling.

09:27.186 --> 09:29.813
I miss being part of a show.

09:29.897 --> 09:31.982
Being part of a company
on tour.

09:32.065 --> 09:34.485
That is just the best thing.

09:34.568 --> 09:36.862
But, of course, the uh,

09:36.945 --> 09:40.199
the quiet life has an
awful lot going for it, too.

09:40.824 --> 09:41.909
Mmm.

09:43.994 --> 09:46.663
Four deer that you know of?

09:46.747 --> 09:49.958
-We're talking
a fair few quid.
-Have you had any problems?

09:50.042 --> 09:53.837
I don't see every animal
every day, but no, nothing.

09:53.921 --> 09:57.424
-Could be they're
targeting Glenbogle.
-Why would they do that?

09:57.508 --> 09:59.259
Because of me, he means.

09:59.343 --> 10:01.553
Because Golly's
little lassie's in charge.

10:01.637 --> 10:02.846
STUART: Word gets round.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.848
A female ghillie on the staff.

10:04.932 --> 10:08.018
I even heard a rumour
your father was off with
some young dancer.

10:08.101 --> 10:10.771
It's a mini break.
They haven't eloped!

10:10.854 --> 10:14.274
-I'm only saying what I heard.
-I don't want anyone thinking
Glenbogle's a soft touch.

10:14.358 --> 10:16.777
But they're not going to,
Paul,

10:16.860 --> 10:18.445
I'll put a stop to it.
Don't worry.

10:18.529 --> 10:19.905
If there's anything I
can do to help...

10:19.988 --> 10:21.824
-No, we don't need...
-PAUL: I'd appreciate that.

10:21.907 --> 10:24.952
Uh, no reflection on you,
Jess. Just makes sense
for us to co-operate.

10:25.702 --> 10:27.496
STUART: Aye, it does.

10:27.579 --> 10:29.915
Your dad and my dad were pals.

10:29.998 --> 10:31.834
I'm sure we can
work together.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.669
I'll keep you in the loop.

10:33.752 --> 10:35.587
I look forward to it.

10:41.885 --> 10:44.805
I'm surprised, I have to say.

10:44.888 --> 10:47.349
Surprised and disappointed.

10:47.432 --> 10:50.018
-I just don't want to get
any bother.
-There'd be no bother.

10:50.102 --> 10:54.064
I'm simply suggesting
we do our bit
to protect the estate, but...

10:54.690 --> 10:56.358
Well...

10:56.441 --> 10:58.277
I shall go it alone.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.611
Wait.

11:03.031 --> 11:06.452
-What do you want to do?
-I thought I might fire up
my old motor

11:06.535 --> 11:08.120
and go for a spin
round the woods.

11:08.203 --> 11:09.455
You're not supposed to drive.

11:09.538 --> 11:12.416
Well, that's why I thought
I'd enlist your help.

11:13.292 --> 11:14.710
(CLATTERING)

11:14.793 --> 11:16.253
Take a look at the engine.

11:16.336 --> 11:19.089
I don't want her dying on us
in the middle
of a hot pursuit.

11:19.173 --> 11:21.425
There's not gonna be
any hot pursuits. Got it?

11:21.508 --> 11:23.719
I'll leave the driving
entirely to you.

11:23.802 --> 11:26.180
I shall simply
be riding shotgun.

11:27.514 --> 11:29.308
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

11:36.273 --> 11:40.360
-Am I okay to put this up?
-Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

11:40.444 --> 11:43.947
Poachers, is it?
Nasty business for a wee girl
like yourself.

11:44.031 --> 11:47.409
-Nothing I can't handle.
-Big estate like Glenbogle.

11:47.493 --> 11:49.328
It's not a doll's house
you're playing with.

11:49.411 --> 11:51.580
I never had much time
for dolls.

11:51.663 --> 11:53.332
Even when I was a wee girl.

11:53.415 --> 11:56.293
Is that so? Bit of a tomboy?

11:56.376 --> 12:00.005
Course, there's other words
for that these days, eh, boys?

Mr Cooper, isn't it?

12:04.092 --> 12:07.095
-Tam Cooper?
-Aye.

12:07.179 --> 12:10.182
My dad always says
he can't believe how well
you do with the dice.

12:10.265 --> 12:13.769
-Is that so?
-Aye. He says he's amazed
you can count the spots.

12:13.852 --> 12:16.396
(ALL LAUGHING)

12:16.480 --> 12:18.941
I'll mention that to your dad
next time I see him.

12:19.024 --> 12:21.276
I hope I'm there when you do.

12:21.777 --> 12:23.737
Okay...

12:23.821 --> 12:26.490
If you hear of anything,
you can call the office

12:26.573 --> 12:29.201
or the police in confidence.

12:29.284 --> 12:31.120
This is bad for the estate

12:32.037 --> 12:34.373
and that's bad for all of us.

12:34.456 --> 12:37.126
A lassie doing a man's job,
that's what's bad
for the estate.

12:37.209 --> 12:39.169
You're a joke, darlin'!

12:48.512 --> 12:52.182
You can call me all the names
you like, Mr Cooper,

12:52.266 --> 12:54.351
but don't call me "darlin'".

12:58.981 --> 13:01.900
You... You do
do venison, yes?

13:01.984 --> 13:03.527
Yes, sir.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.237
It's pan-fried

13:05.320 --> 13:07.781
and served with
a port reduction

13:07.865 --> 13:10.367
with shallots and a nest
of potato.

13:10.451 --> 13:12.578
Is it?

13:12.661 --> 13:15.164
And when was the beast killed?
Do you know that?

13:15.247 --> 13:18.167
-Killed, sir?
-Yeah, killed.

13:18.250 --> 13:21.503
And moreover, was it butchered
on site or was it
carried across the country

13:21.587 --> 13:24.882
with its innards still inside?

13:24.965 --> 13:28.594
I really don't have
that kind of information
at my fingertips, sir.

13:28.677 --> 13:32.222
-GOLLY: Don't you?
-No. Our chef may have
a better idea.

13:32.306 --> 13:34.183
I think you should
go and ask him, Golly.

13:34.266 --> 13:36.935
I think you're right, lass.

13:37.019 --> 13:39.897
When it comes to venison,
you need to know
where you stand.

What is wrong
with the men round here?

14:14.306 --> 14:17.142

-Can't think where
they get that idea from!
-(GIGGLES)

You've got enough of the stuff
to fill a supermarket.

14:23.857 --> 14:27.903
Yeah, well, you don't make
one jar at a time. You got
to make a whole big batch.

14:30.322 --> 14:34.243
So, what's Paul
been saying to it?

14:34.326 --> 14:36.662
-Nothing.
-It's just that our great
noble laird

14:36.745 --> 14:39.873
was saying that we should
go into the relish
business together.

14:39.957 --> 14:41.375
It's a ridiculous idea.

14:41.458 --> 14:45.087
I wondered why he
was in such a mood
this afternoon.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.756
(SCOFFS)
I don't want to hear about it.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.216
What was he saying?

14:49.299 --> 14:52.177
Not much.
But then he is a guy.

14:52.261 --> 14:54.012
He's not gonna say
what's on his mind, is he?

14:54.096 --> 14:55.097
God forbid!

14:56.306 --> 14:58.433
So, are you and him
sort of...

14:58.517 --> 15:00.727
No. Not at all.

15:00.811 --> 15:04.356
-I wasn't sticking my nose in.
-I know.

15:04.439 --> 15:07.776
It's nice to have someone
to chat to, actually.
Makes a change.

15:07.860 --> 15:12.489
Tell me about it. I've always,
always, always got my dad
and his girlfriend around.

15:12.573 --> 15:14.366
Well, if you ever
fancy escaping...

15:14.450 --> 15:16.952
You know I've got a wee
spare room going here.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.871
I might just take you
up on that.

15:18.954 --> 15:21.498
You might have to put up
with me bending your ear
every now and then.

15:21.582 --> 15:24.293
(SIGHS) Oh, no!

15:24.376 --> 15:27.379
It's good to say things
out loud to someone.

15:27.463 --> 15:30.757

straight in my own head.

What, in broad daylight?

15:46.064 --> 15:50.777

of gangs starting actual
fires before, but not this.

They're messing with us.
We need to get after them.

15:53.906 --> 15:56.992
-Shall I come with you?
Even the odds.
-No, we'll manage, thanks.

15:57.075 --> 15:59.536
But we're not managing
though, are we, Jess?

15:59.620 --> 16:01.246

I'm gonna let him.

about the car.

There's no shame in this,

When your dad was alive,
did he ever ask
my dad for help?

16:39.034 --> 16:41.787
He was too proud
to ask anyone for anything.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.373
Well, maybe I'm too proud
as well, Stuart.

16:44.456 --> 16:45.916

-JESS: Near Campbell's Crag.

Head that way
and we'll cut them off.
Jess out.

17:09.857 --> 17:11.358
So could they.

-Jess...
-It's okay.

They were Hector's special
anti-poacher shells.

because he knows

-I got a call last night
from a pal.

He's entertainment director
on a cruise ship.

20:54.832 --> 20:58.001
And one of his dancers
has popped her Achilles, so...

20:58.085 --> 21:00.712
He wants you to cover for her.

21:00.796 --> 21:03.674

And it's a 12-month contract.

exactly Broadway,
but it is dancing.

really exciting.

told you earlier,

"confined to barracks" means?

all too familiar with.

it to Ewan and we won't have

-You?

of us to believe.

to come over

Yeah, I'd like that.

bringing a date?

you know... Need to know...

23:39.580 --> 23:41.373
No. No date.

23:41.457 --> 23:43.750

-Do you think I could
ask you a favour?
-Fire away.

23:46.628 --> 23:49.465
It's just if I'm going to ask
some of our other neighbours,

23:49.548 --> 23:54.386
it would be useful to have
someone with me to know
the lie of the land.

23:54.470 --> 23:56.930
Well, I suppose I could
spare an hour.

23:57.014 --> 23:58.557
Brilliant.

23:58.640 --> 24:02.144
I saw a small farm
just up the road.
We could start there.

26:23.577 --> 26:26.413
No, Stuart, I won't shh!
Is that gun loaded?

26:26.497 --> 26:29.541
-Well, it wouldn't be
much use otherwise, would it?
-Stuart!

26:29.625 --> 26:32.878
-What are you doing?
-You don't walk around
with loaded guns.

26:32.961 --> 26:36.507
-They do!
-And that's what makes
them, them and us, us.

26:39.551 --> 26:42.596
-I wasn't thinking.
-Are things that bad?

26:42.679 --> 26:45.641
Am I so hopeless
that even other ghillies think

26:45.724 --> 26:50.062
that it's a good idea
to wander around my estate
with loaded guns?

26:50.145 --> 26:53.357
I'm so pitiful you need think
you need to break
every rule in the book?

26:53.440 --> 26:55.150
-No, Jess.
-Yes, Stuart.

26:57.069 --> 26:59.947
It's open season at Glenbogle.
Anyone can do what they like.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.116
It's open season! (ECHOES)

27:04.493 --> 27:05.828
I'm sorry.

27:07.037 --> 27:08.622
I thought I was helping.

27:09.748 --> 27:11.500
It's okay.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.961
It's not your fault.
Not really.

27:14.044 --> 27:16.046
It's the job.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.799
No, no, I would love to come.

27:18.882 --> 27:21.135
So, what is it?
Formal? Casual?

27:21.218 --> 27:23.303
Well, any excuse
to get dolled up.

27:23.387 --> 27:26.598
Mmm! I'll see if I can find
a little number somewhere.

27:26.682 --> 27:29.226
Or you could just
wear your new hat.

27:30.686 --> 27:34.815
Ahem. Yeah.
It's not a new hat.
It's for my scarecrow.

27:34.898 --> 27:37.734
And you're wearing it
just one last time?

27:37.818 --> 27:39.862
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

27:39.945 --> 27:41.613
Well, we should get going.

27:41.697 --> 27:43.574
Paul's kind of showing
me around.

27:43.657 --> 27:46.702
-That's very nice of him.
-I'm happy to help anyone.

27:46.785 --> 27:48.954
-Anyone who'll let me.
-LUCY: You see?

27:49.037 --> 27:54.042
Now this is exactly the sort
of attitude I was hoping
to find when I moved up here.

27:54.126 --> 27:57.463
-Is everyone
this good-natured?
-No.

27:57.546 --> 27:59.923
No, I'd say
Paul's a bit special.

28:01.467 --> 28:03.969
So, I'll see you
both tonight, then.

28:04.052 --> 28:07.347
-Yeah, I'm so looking
forward to it.
-Yeah, me too.

28:09.933 --> 28:12.561
-Well?
-No way. You heard
what Paul said.

28:12.644 --> 28:16.315
Oh, you know Paul's a stout
enough fellow, but,

28:16.398 --> 28:18.609
the military ruined him,
you know.

28:18.692 --> 28:20.444
You and I,

28:20.527 --> 28:23.030
we're mavericks.

28:23.113 --> 28:26.492
-I'm not listening.

What sort of a man
gets the girls, Ewan?
(CLEARS THROAT)

28:29.661 --> 28:32.206
The honest squaddie
happily doing his KP duty?

28:32.289 --> 28:34.500
Or the dynamic covert agent?

28:37.586 --> 28:40.380
No, I'm not doing it.
Not even for girls.

28:40.464 --> 28:43.300
Then do it for Glenbogle.

28:43.383 --> 28:46.428
They're roaming across this
place striking wherever
it takes their fancy.

28:46.512 --> 28:49.181
Doesn't it make your blood
boil to think of them

28:49.264 --> 28:51.058
despoiling our home?

28:52.392 --> 28:54.812
-Home?
-Yes.

28:54.895 --> 28:57.272
I thought this was just
one big jail cell to you.

28:57.356 --> 29:01.735
Oh, well, I do have many
conflicting emotions
about Glenbogle, Ewan.

29:01.819 --> 29:03.362
You love it here, you old con.

29:03.445 --> 29:05.906
One thing I've never felt
for this place is contempt.

29:05.989 --> 29:08.408
I'll not allow anyone to treat
it with contempt either.

29:11.078 --> 29:12.663
No guns this time.

29:12.746 --> 29:14.289
No weapons at all,

29:14.373 --> 29:17.126

mind or two.

-I'm in.
-Excellent! (CLEARS THROAT)

29:21.713 --> 29:23.257
I shall need a dead fish.

29:25.342 --> 29:28.345
Hey, I got PC Callum
to fax over the details
of any poaching

29:28.428 --> 29:30.389
reported in the last 10 years

29:30.472 --> 29:32.808
to see if there's anything
in common with ours.

29:32.891 --> 29:34.434
Good idea.

29:34.518 --> 29:38.230
Yep. I'm just going
to spend a bit of time
going over everything.

29:38.313 --> 29:40.107
And maybe something
will leap out at me.

29:40.190 --> 29:43.443
-Okay. Well, I'll give
the party a miss.
-There's no need.

29:43.527 --> 29:45.320
Well, two heads are better
than one.

29:45.404 --> 29:46.780
Isn't that what you
said about Stuart?

29:49.741 --> 29:51.618
(CLICKS TONGUE) Sorry.

29:52.578 --> 29:54.872
But because "we"

29:54.955 --> 29:56.582
asked for his help,

29:56.665 --> 29:59.168
he thinks it's okay to walk
about the estate
with a loaded gun.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.254
You're joking.

30:02.337 --> 30:04.798
-I'll have a word with him.
-No, I've taken care of it.

30:04.882 --> 30:07.134
Look, Stuart's not
the problem, Paul.

30:07.217 --> 30:08.802
He's a good guy.

30:08.886 --> 30:12.347
It's just, I feel like ever
since this thing started...

30:12.431 --> 30:14.766
Everyone's been interfering.

30:14.850 --> 30:17.144
-Mainly me.
-You're the laird, Paul.

30:17.227 --> 30:19.146
Yeah, but a good laird knows
when to trust his people.

30:20.772 --> 30:22.441
(SIGHS) Okay.

30:23.692 --> 30:25.110
You take the lead
from now on, Jess.

30:25.861 --> 30:27.613
Okay.

30:27.696 --> 30:30.240
Then go to your party.
If I come up with anything,
I'll let you know.

30:31.658 --> 30:32.993
All right.

this poor lieutenant
has gone AWOL.

He knew exactly what
he was doing.

your CO's daughter.

It was no fun
being me, honestly.

complained about
overprotective fathers, but

mine could mobilise NATO
to stop me going on a date!

is retired now

be a catch.

so I can carry it around
everywhere.

37:54.309 --> 37:57.229
-Great.
-Yeah, it might after
a while, yeah.

38:00.315 --> 38:03.443
Right. Okay, well, I'm um,

38:03.527 --> 38:06.822
I'm Chester Grant and
I'd uh, like to

38:06.905 --> 38:09.783
welcome you all
to this... This...

38:09.867 --> 38:12.119
-House-warming?
-If you like.

38:12.202 --> 38:16.081
House-warming.
I hope it will be
the first of many

38:16.165 --> 38:19.418
pleasant evenings and that we
all become friends.

38:20.752 --> 38:22.212
Good friends.

38:23.213 --> 38:24.381
So, champagne!

38:27.384 --> 38:28.594
(SIGHS)

38:53.911 --> 38:55.120
Stuart.

38:56.789 --> 38:57.998
Stuart.

38:59.666 --> 39:01.794
(GROANS IN FRUSTRATION)

39:01.877 --> 39:05.339
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
STUART: Jess, you in there?

39:05.422 --> 39:07.424
Yep. Yep, come on in.

39:13.972 --> 39:16.099
Look, uh...

39:16.183 --> 39:18.018
(CLICKS TONGUE) I know you
were down before...

39:18.101 --> 39:20.395
Oh, I'm over that.

39:20.479 --> 39:23.190
-In fact, I've got a plan.
-Is that so?

39:26.109 --> 39:27.236
Gonna fill me in?

39:28.779 --> 39:30.864
Yeah. Yeah, if you like.

39:32.032 --> 39:33.992
(CHEERING)

39:35.327 --> 39:37.579
-That was cool!
-Yeah, I know.

39:38.497 --> 39:39.581
Showing off!

39:44.002 --> 39:45.462
There you go.

39:46.713 --> 39:49.216
No, no, no, no, no.
Not for me, no.

39:49.299 --> 39:52.511
So, what does everybody do
for beer around here?

39:52.594 --> 39:55.180
Well, there's heavy,
uh, 80 shilling.

39:55.264 --> 39:59.643
Ah-ha! Make mine
40 shillings worth, then.

39:59.726 --> 40:02.813
-I'll have a half of it.
-I'm sticking to bubbly.

40:02.896 --> 40:04.398
Looks like the bubbly's
sticking to you.

40:04.481 --> 40:05.858
What is that supposed to mean?

40:05.941 --> 40:07.234
Nothing. Nothing at all.

40:07.860 --> 40:09.111
Good.

40:09.194 --> 40:12.197
So, Chester,

40:12.281 --> 40:14.116
tell us all about yourself.

40:14.199 --> 40:15.826
Chickens.

40:15.909 --> 40:18.620
That's how I made my money.
Oh, ta.

40:18.704 --> 40:21.039
Cheers.

40:21.123 --> 40:24.460
Nineteen million pre-packed
drumsticks a year.

40:24.543 --> 40:28.046
Then when I saw all that
organic nonsense, I sold up.

40:28.130 --> 40:30.132
I made a good price, though.

40:30.215 --> 40:32.801
Chester, Isobel is
an organic farmer.

40:33.385 --> 40:36.346
(LAUGHS) Oh!

40:36.430 --> 40:39.183
-(CLICKS TONGUE) Well, you
don't look too bad either.
-Why, thank you.

40:39.266 --> 40:41.977
This is nice.
I could get used to this.

40:43.187 --> 40:44.813
So, um,

40:44.897 --> 40:48.108
50 quid on a game or a frame
or a set or whatever
you call it.

40:48.192 --> 40:50.611
You don't know the rules,
but you want to bet money?

40:50.694 --> 40:53.530
Yeah, place like this,
you need to make
your own excitement, eh?

40:53.614 --> 40:57.493
Oh, but you would be surprised
what goes on
in a place like this.

40:57.576 --> 41:00.329
-Oh, really?
-Uh, Ignore her, Chester.

41:00.412 --> 41:03.332
-It's the champagne talking.
-No, it's not.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.501
You see, Chester,

41:05.584 --> 41:07.961
at Glenbogle we've got
the black sheep uncle

41:08.045 --> 41:10.756
-who's here
under house arrest.
-Ooh!

41:10.839 --> 41:12.841
And then we've got
the new laird

41:12.925 --> 41:16.136
-who was born on the wrong
side of the blanket.
-(CHUCKLES)

41:16.220 --> 41:17.805
Well, I've heard all
these stories before,

41:17.888 --> 41:20.808
so, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get
some fresh air.

41:22.309 --> 41:23.310
I'll go with you.

41:25.938 --> 41:28.398
-Fancy a game, then?
-Okay.

41:29.566 --> 41:31.235
Practically all our deer

41:31.318 --> 41:33.487
are at the south west
feeding station.

41:33.570 --> 41:35.864
Paul and I can
stake those out.

41:37.491 --> 41:40.786
There is a handful
in Fir Tree Glen, but och,

41:40.869 --> 41:43.413
the gang won't spot
them there.

41:43.497 --> 41:46.500
(CLICKS TONGUE)
You've got it all worked out.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.669
Yeah, yeah, I have.
(INHALES)

41:48.752 --> 41:51.880
You get back and look after
your own estate.

41:51.964 --> 41:54.550
If you're sure you
can cope without me.

41:54.633 --> 41:57.219
-I'm positive.
-Still friends though?

41:58.804 --> 42:00.305
Actually, yes.

42:01.056 --> 42:02.266
(CHUCKLES)

42:04.685 --> 42:06.728
-I'll see you later.
-Yep.

42:19.199 --> 42:21.910
-Oh, man!
-Are you sure?

42:21.994 --> 42:23.829
Your mate from the pub
jumped in the passenger seat

42:23.912 --> 42:26.415
of that Land Rover
and they drove off.

42:26.498 --> 42:28.459
-Now him and Jess are...
-Canoodling.

42:28.542 --> 42:30.043
Aye.

42:30.127 --> 42:31.462
What are we gonna do?

42:34.673 --> 42:36.758
There you go, Cinderella.

42:36.842 --> 42:39.094
I'm not big on fairy tales.

42:39.178 --> 42:42.431
No, me neither.

42:42.514 --> 42:44.433
I think you have to work
hard for what you want.

42:47.853 --> 42:50.314
Does that sound
really unromantic?

42:51.315 --> 42:52.941
No.

42:53.025 --> 42:54.735
Actually, it does.

42:56.153 --> 42:58.530
Summer's evening, on a terrace

42:58.614 --> 43:01.533
with a really
quite handsome man

43:01.617 --> 43:04.077
and uh, here I am,

43:04.161 --> 43:05.913
ruining the moment.

43:06.789 --> 43:07.915
You're doing all right.

43:08.916 --> 43:10.501
-Am I?
-Yeah.

43:15.172 --> 43:16.507
Sorry.

43:17.508 --> 43:19.468
Sorry, that was uh,

43:19.551 --> 43:21.303
inappropriate

43:21.386 --> 43:24.014
and too much champagne,
I think.

43:25.390 --> 43:26.433
It's fine.

43:41.031 --> 43:45.160
JESS: Paul Bowman here?
CHESTER: Paul? Yeah,
I think he's outside.

43:45.244 --> 43:46.995
Yeah, they're out here
on the terrace.

43:48.831 --> 43:51.250
-Jess?
-Are you ready to go
and catch some poachers?

43:51.333 --> 43:53.627
Yes, I'm up for it.

43:53.710 --> 43:55.629
Uh, sorry, Chester,

43:55.712 --> 43:57.840
this is Glenbogle business.

44:01.510 --> 44:03.345
I've really got to go.

44:03.428 --> 44:05.806
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

44:05.889 --> 44:08.851
We're neighbours.
I'm sure we'll bump into
one another again.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.521
Excuse me.

44:14.565 --> 44:17.234
Come in, Paul. Over.

44:17.317 --> 44:19.403
PAUL: I'm here. Over.

44:19.486 --> 44:21.280
So are they,

44:21.363 --> 44:24.450
right by Fir Tree Glen.
Over.

44:24.533 --> 44:26.326
PAUL: I'm on my way.

44:39.131 --> 44:41.592
JESS: What have I told you
about carrying guns
on my estate?

44:41.675 --> 44:44.303
-I told you this was
no job for a lassie.
-Now that's enough.

44:44.386 --> 44:46.180
Like I said, Stuart.

44:46.263 --> 44:48.223
I don't need your help.

44:51.101 --> 44:52.978
You're not jailing me.

45:00.194 --> 45:02.988
-You okay here?
-Nothing I can't handle.

45:03.071 --> 45:05.199
-Go get him.
-All right.

45:07.451 --> 45:08.869
Why?

45:08.952 --> 45:12.414
Your family have been
ghillies for generations.

45:12.498 --> 45:14.333
Not everyone wants
to be like their dad.

45:14.958 --> 45:16.877
(GASPS)

45:16.960 --> 45:18.629
That doesn't make it okay
to betray their memory
though, does it?

45:18.712 --> 45:20.255
Or the people you work for.

45:20.964 --> 45:22.007
Or your friends.

45:22.966 --> 45:26.345
I'm sorry.
I owed a lot of money.

45:26.428 --> 45:28.222
I had some bad luck
on the dice.

45:29.056 --> 45:30.057
To him?

45:31.934 --> 45:33.018
He's a cheat, Stuart.

45:34.645 --> 45:37.314
Make sure you let
the rest of D wing
know about it,

45:37.397 --> 45:38.732
won't you?

45:43.570 --> 45:44.863
(SNORING)

45:55.707 --> 45:58.377
-Donald, wake up. Donald!
-(GROANING)

45:59.128 --> 46:01.088
Here's your big chance.

46:05.092 --> 46:06.593
My big chance.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.681
Stop.

46:13.058 --> 46:17.604
Are you familiar with
Pai Mei's White Lotus
Shanghai technique?

46:17.688 --> 46:21.817
It's the second oldest form of
unarmed combat known to man.

46:21.900 --> 46:23.527
Oh, aye!

46:23.610 --> 46:26.155
-And what's the oldest like?
-This.

46:28.198 --> 46:29.451
(GROANS)

46:32.828 --> 46:35.539
Eh, Paul, we didn't mean to.
We just...

46:35.622 --> 46:37.624
Oh, my back!
My back!

46:38.208 --> 46:39.668
Relax, lad.

46:39.751 --> 46:42.629
I'm sure Paul appreciates
our show of initiative.

46:45.924 --> 46:47.509
-(GROANS)
-Are you in a lot of pain?

46:47.593 --> 46:49.511
(GROANING)

46:54.099 --> 46:56.602
Yeah, I appreciate
it very much.

46:58.562 --> 46:59.563
(CHUCKLES)

47:17.372 --> 47:20.584
Beautiful at this time
of the day.

47:20.667 --> 47:23.086
I've lived my whole life
with this view.

47:23.170 --> 47:26.048
I still never tire of it.

47:26.131 --> 47:30.302
-I do love this place,
you know, Golly.
-Hmm.

47:30.385 --> 47:34.139
-Just not enough,
though, eh?
-Don't be angry with me.

47:35.641 --> 47:39.019
I'm just sick to death
of people running out on me.

47:40.479 --> 47:42.773
The whole world's
in that view, Meg.

47:42.856 --> 47:45.859
It's got everything
you'll ever need.

47:45.943 --> 47:49.488
-All you have to do is
open up your heart to it.
-I want to.

47:49.571 --> 47:53.659
All the way back in the car,
I wanted to say something.

47:53.742 --> 47:58.163
-Well, say it now.
-Look, I love dancing, okay?

47:58.247 --> 48:01.125
Even cheesy cabaret on a boat.
I love it.

48:01.208 --> 48:03.544
And it's probably
the last chance I'll have.

48:06.088 --> 48:08.549
But I just don't want to go.

48:11.593 --> 48:12.761
I want to stay here.

48:14.012 --> 48:15.305
With you.

48:25.482 --> 48:29.528
-Oh, lass, lass, lass, lass!
-(LAUGHS)

48:29.611 --> 48:31.697
All right, all right,
break it up!

48:33.949 --> 48:36.493
-And where have you been?
-Out catching poachers.

48:36.577 --> 48:38.829
-What do you mean?
-Relax, Golly.

48:38.912 --> 48:41.832
It's all taken care of.

48:41.915 --> 48:44.751
-Jess sorted them out.
-Well done, lass.

48:49.923 --> 48:51.717
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

48:57.097 --> 48:58.265
Right!

49:04.480 --> 49:05.814
Ah!

49:05.898 --> 49:09.443
-(ALL CHEER)
-DONALD: Sore head?

49:09.526 --> 49:11.778
-A port and brandy, Ewan.
-(LAUGHS)

49:11.862 --> 49:15.574
No, thanks, I had way
too much to drink last night.

49:15.657 --> 49:18.535
-You could say that, yeah.
-I wanted to apologise.

49:18.619 --> 49:22.247
-There's no need.
-So I brought
a peace offering.

49:24.416 --> 49:26.376
-What's this? Oh!
-JESS: Oh!

49:26.460 --> 49:28.545
-Relish?
-That's what it is.

49:28.629 --> 49:31.882
Well, I thought you should try
a bit if we're gonna put
Glenbogle's name on the jars.

49:31.965 --> 49:34.426
-Indeed.
-I thought you weren't keen
on that idea.

49:34.510 --> 49:36.887
It's a lady's prerogative
to change her mind, Paul,

49:36.970 --> 49:40.891
-and this is delicious.
-Oh, I know.
He's right for once.

49:40.974 --> 49:42.810
-It's great.
-In business then?

49:44.603 --> 49:46.396
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.981
(ALL CHEERING)

49:49.733 --> 49:51.777
Will I get a rent rebate
when you're a millionnairess?

49:51.860 --> 49:53.320
I wish.

49:53.403 --> 49:56.824
Um, look, I've decided to take
a room down at the farm.

49:56.907 --> 50:00.285
-Just to give you guys
a bit of privacy.
-Ah, if you're sure.

50:00.369 --> 50:01.787
Yeah, I am.

50:01.870 --> 50:03.330
No offence, Golly, mate,

50:03.413 --> 50:04.706
but you're like
a million years old.

50:04.790 --> 50:06.291
-(LAUGHS)
-Oh, thanks.

50:06.375 --> 50:08.377
How come you've got
a love nest and I've not?

50:08.460 --> 50:11.004
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
There's no need
to upset yourself, boy.

50:11.088 --> 50:15.217
You're not the only bachelor
around here, you know.
What about me and Paul?

50:15.300 --> 50:17.886
-You're even older than him.
-What?

50:17.970 --> 50:20.514
And uh, Paul's doing
all right, aren't you, boss?

50:20.597 --> 50:23.643
Oh! Has the laird an admirer?

50:23.725 --> 50:26.145
That sexy wee Miss Ford
from down the road.

50:26.228 --> 50:28.105
DONALD: Oh! No!

50:28.188 --> 50:31.817
-He's blushing, man. There's
definitely something going on.
-ALL: Aww!

50:31.900 --> 50:35.028
-I need to go. Bye!
-ALL: Bye.

50:35.112 --> 50:36.989
Stay for a bit.

50:37.072 --> 50:40.117
I'm sorry, it's the hangover,
but um,

50:40.200 --> 50:43.328
I'll be in touch.
We need to talk relish, eh?

50:43.412 --> 50:44.913
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

50:44.997 --> 50:46.665
-Yeah, okay.
-Bye.
