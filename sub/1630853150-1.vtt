00:26.494 --> 00:27.695
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Want
me to come pick you up?

00:27.728 --> 00:28.596
LILY (ON PHONE): OK.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.630
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): OK.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.398
Oh, that's what they tell me.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.199
OK, all right.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.600
Bye.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.601
Hey, Merry.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.502
Hey.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.803
MERRY (ON PHONE): Hey.

00:35.836 --> 00:36.804
-Sure.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.472
Yeah, I'll come pick her up.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.274
This is the best protein
drink ever right here.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.681
Gotta stay lean and fit.

00:47.715 --> 00:52.686
Omega-3s, omega-6s, and a little
bit of saturated fat.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.588
But it's good fat.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.490
Ah, maybe I'll cut a mango up.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.491
Let's just try that one today.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.659
Oh, man, that's a raw--

00:58.692 --> 01:00.228
that's a pretty old mango.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.263
This is what it's like when
you're a bachelor.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.298
You have old, raw stuff.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.337
It-- it doesn't need
to go in there.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.147
Oh, I almost forgot--

01:19.180 --> 01:22.450
forgot my, uh, coffee.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.651
I've done that before.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.458
But we're about to go pick up
my daughter right now, which

01:30.491 --> 01:32.226
is great because Lily
lives close to me.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.494
And it's wonderful.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.229
But she lives with me half
the time or with

01:35.263 --> 01:36.230
mom half the time.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.366
We have a good relationship.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.667
Hey, sweetie.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.870
There you go.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.272
Lily, are you--

01:44.305 --> 01:46.307
are you already texting
this morning?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.608
Oh, my gosh.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.576
How many texts do you
think you do a day?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.413
-Oh, you don't do 1,000.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.348
But you do a lot, don't you?

01:54.382 --> 01:55.849
Are you-- a day?

01:55.883 --> 01:57.251
See you about 2:00.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.456
Are you excited about
coming today?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.524
Huh?

02:03.557 --> 02:04.425
It's going to be
fun, isn't it?

02:04.458 --> 02:05.626
What are we do today?

02:05.659 --> 02:08.229
Are we going to do two
fillings today?

02:08.262 --> 02:11.765
I think we are, aren't we?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.867
Can I ask-- can I ask
you another-- can

02:13.901 --> 02:15.736
I ask another question?

02:15.769 --> 02:16.870
Please?

02:16.904 --> 02:20.674
Just one more question,
just one.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.676
I'm not going to ask
two questions.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.617
Can I ask three questions?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.186
KID (OFFSCREEN): Yes.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.555
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Can I ask
you just like-- can I ask five

02:34.588 --> 02:36.957
questions or one?

02:36.990 --> 02:37.925
Five--

02:37.958 --> 02:38.959
all right.

02:38.992 --> 02:39.793
Question number five.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.561
You ready?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.463
[phone rings]

02:42.496 --> 02:43.797
-Dr. Hardy's office.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.533
This is Tina.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.536
-If you was another age-- if
you were another age, would

02:48.569 --> 02:50.538
you like to be seven or eight?

02:50.571 --> 02:52.273
If you-- could you--

02:52.306 --> 02:54.308
which would you like to--

02:54.342 --> 02:56.544
can I ask you another
question?

02:56.577 --> 03:00.748
-Dr. Hardy as a boss is just
like he is as a friend.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.385
I mean, we to him just
like he's one of us.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.221
We talk to him about anything.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.690
-Not long after George set up
his practice, we had some

03:09.723 --> 03:13.694
students who had major dental
work that needed to be done.

03:13.727 --> 03:18.299
And George, after one phone
call, took that on, basically

03:18.332 --> 03:21.602
transformed the lives of a
couple of kids by doing their

03:21.635 --> 03:23.337
dental work totally free.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.307
Didn't have to do that, but did
it because he know that's

03:26.340 --> 03:27.308
what those kids needed.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.642
And it's change their lives.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.578
-Which one do you like?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.513
Which one do you
like, sweetie?

03:32.546 --> 03:36.684
-George Hardy is the most
authentic, alive person.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.952
A lot of people, as they get
older, they get set in their

03:38.986 --> 03:40.788
ways, and they get bored
with their life.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.656
Or they just get settled.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.957
Somebody like George--
he's not settled.

03:43.991 --> 03:44.692
You know?

03:44.725 --> 03:45.826
He's alive.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.894
-Will you kill me
if I tell them?

03:46.927 --> 03:47.628
-No, tell them.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.397
Tell them.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.366
-The reason that the home town
folks love George is because

03:52.400 --> 03:56.370
George dresses up like a roller
blading tooth fairy in

03:56.404 --> 03:58.439
the Christmas parade
every year.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.479
-I'm--

04:05.513 --> 04:06.380
I'm trying to think
of somebody that

04:06.414 --> 04:07.915
might not like George.

04:07.948 --> 04:08.582
I can't think of one person who
doesn't like George Hardy.

04:11.519 --> 04:18.426
I mean if his ex-wife likes
him as much as I like him,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.994
then, you know, I think it'd be
pretty hard for anybody to

04:21.028 --> 04:22.763
not like George.

04:22.796 --> 04:26.400
-He has always been one of the
most fun people that I know.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.670
I don't think I've ever seen
George when he wasn't smiling.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.004
-Hey, Barbara.

04:31.038 --> 04:31.905
-Hey, George.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.873
How are you?

04:32.906 --> 04:33.574
-Good, how about you?

04:33.607 --> 04:34.442
-I'm fine.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.610
Good to see you too.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.547
He loves people, and he likes
the reaction that

04:39.580 --> 04:40.881
he gets from people.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.383
-How you been?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.518
You always answer the
phone so great here.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.519
I just--

04:45.553 --> 04:46.053
-Oh, thank you.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.588
Thank you.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.689
-Really, honestly, every
time I call down here.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.491
Hey, how you doing?

04:50.524 --> 04:54.795
-He is one of the-- the kindest
and finest people that

04:54.828 --> 04:58.599
I have ever seen in my life,
even though he's my son.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.001
He's just-- he's just
fun to be around.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.940
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): What did
you think of your son's

05:06.974 --> 05:10.010
performance in "Troll 2?"

05:10.043 --> 05:11.579
-Oh, my gosh.

05:11.612 --> 05:15.115
[laughs]

05:15.148 --> 05:16.717
Let's say, he's--

05:16.750 --> 05:17.918
he's not very grand.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.525
-So where's that damn mirror?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.694
-Well, I left in about the
middle of the movie.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.095
I just couldn't take
it anymore.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.431
And I thought, what
is he doing?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.700
-It's got to be your
imagination or a

05:32.733 --> 05:34.067
hallucination.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.404
Are you still smoking
dope, Holly?

05:36.437 --> 05:37.971
-I've known George for years.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.074
And he came in the store one
day, and I asked him.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.444
I said, you know, George, were
you ever in a movie?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.446
And he said, uh, yes.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.614
Why?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.048
And I said, well, I
think I saw it.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.852
I said, I saw this movie "Troll
2." And it was just

05:51.885 --> 05:54.922
crazy because nobody in the
community even knew that

05:54.955 --> 05:56.724
George was in a film.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.394
-We don't speak too much about
it, but he did make his movie

06:00.428 --> 06:02.563
about 17 years ago.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.932
We didn't know whether to tell
people about it or kind of

06:04.965 --> 06:07.000
keep it quiet.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.802
-I walked up to the counter,
and I said to the fella--

06:08.836 --> 06:11.705
I said, I'm here to pick up a
movie that you've got on hold

06:11.739 --> 06:15.976
called "Troll 2." And this guy
that's standing next to me at

06:16.009 --> 06:18.045
the counter-- he was getting
another movie too.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.414
And he looked at me, and
he said, oh, my gosh.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.483
He said, that's the worst
movie I've ever seen.

06:28.522 --> 06:32.860
[screams]

06:32.893 --> 06:34.862
-Wait till you get home
and watch the movie.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.030
And he was right.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.098
-It was so bad.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.133
And he was so--

06:40.167 --> 06:42.503
his accent and his acting--

06:42.536 --> 06:44.838
it was just so--

06:44.872 --> 06:47.207
just the strangest
thing to watch.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.042
-It was so not him.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.578
You know?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.813
Knowing the real person
in seeing him doing--

06:52.846 --> 06:54.715
using the word acting loosely.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.149
It was just hilarious.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.219
-Do you see this writing?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.121
Do you know what it means?

07:03.791 --> 07:04.958
Hospitality.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.729
And you can't piss
on hospitality.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.831
I won't allow it!

07:10.864 --> 07:12.966
-What are you going to
do to me, daddy?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.535
-Tightening my belt
by one loop so I

07:14.568 --> 07:15.703
don't feel hunger pains.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.904
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN):
OK, pause it.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.171
Rewind.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.573
He's right there.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.879
That's me, Michael
Paul Stephenson.

07:25.913 --> 07:30.918
And 18 years ago, I got the lead
role in my first movie.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.185
-Nilbog.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.655
It's goblin spelled backwards!

07:34.688 --> 07:36.724
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): At that
time, the movie was titled

07:36.757 --> 07:39.660
"Goblin." It was directed by
Italian filmmaker Claudio

07:39.693 --> 07:44.131
Fragasso and written by his
wife, Rosella Drudi.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.200
We filmed the movie over the
course of three weeks in

07:47.234 --> 07:50.904
small-town Utah in the
summer of 1989.

07:50.938 --> 07:51.905
It was hard work.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.206
It was-- it was tough work.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.744
But it was a small price
to pay for stardom.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.919
See, as a child actor, this was
the big break that I was

08:05.953 --> 08:07.187
waiting for.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.789
I thought that I was
going to be famous.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.225
I couldn't wait to see my
movie on the big screen.

08:12.259 --> 08:17.665
But my movie never made
it to the big screen.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.702
In fact, the first time that
I saw my movie was one year

08:21.735 --> 08:24.572
later on Christmas morning.

08:24.605 --> 08:31.845
I unwrapped my last present to
reveal a VHS copy of my movie.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.147
I was so excited to see
this for the first

08:34.181 --> 08:35.683
time with my family.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.751
I grabbed the tape, and
I stuck it in the VCR.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.988
And then I pressed play.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.224
[screams]

08:44.256 --> 08:46.927
-90 minutes later, my childhood

08:46.960 --> 08:48.261
dreams went up in flames.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.736
I hated this movie.

08:55.769 --> 09:00.140
I ran from "Troll 2," and I
wanted nothing to do with it.

09:00.173 --> 09:04.277
But that was before I realized
that there was more to this

09:04.311 --> 09:07.615
movie than I understood.

09:07.648 --> 09:11.284
And this is my movie
about that movie.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.023
-Tightening my belt
by one loop so I

09:16.056 --> 09:17.691
don't feel hunger pains.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.793
And your sister and mother
will have to do likewise.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.095
-I was practicing dentistry
in Salt Lake

09:22.129 --> 09:23.631
City, Utah at the time.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.998
I think it was about 1989.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.068
And on a whim, I auditioned
for this movie.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.637
And I did a few--

09:29.670 --> 09:33.273
did dentistry about two or
three days or four days.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.709
And then I'd go back and shoot
and then go back and do

09:35.743 --> 09:36.877
dentistry and go
back and shoot.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.046
I remember doing that
a few times.

09:39.079 --> 09:43.851
The way I first found out that
the movie was released was by

09:43.884 --> 09:45.352
one of my patients.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.855
My patient goes, I seen you
in that movie, Dr. Hardy.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.722
I seen you in that movie.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.923
I go, what movie?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.859
And he goes, "Troll 2."
And I go, what?

09:51.892 --> 09:52.660
What is the name?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.161
What?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.830
Within a day or two, I got a
copy of "Troll 2" on VHS.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.266
And I remember taking that
thing and putting it and

09:59.299 --> 10:01.669
watching my first scene with
Margo on the couch.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.270
-I'm worried about Joshua.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.139
He's still seeing
Grandpa Seth.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.276
-When I was a kid, I had an
imaginary playmate too.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.211
-But it wasn't your
dead grandfather.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.312
-And I thought, oh, man.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.881
This is-- this is bad.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.415
This is really, really bad.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.884
-Michael?

10:16.917 --> 10:19.319
-Yeah?

10:19.352 --> 10:22.355
-Who are the goblins?

10:22.389 --> 10:24.424
-The goblins?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.860
Oh, when it first started
showing up on HBO and all

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
that, people would call
me from all over

10:28.896 --> 10:30.097
the freaking place.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.398
George, you're on TV!

10:34.835 --> 10:35.769
I'd just go, I know.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.670
I know.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.371
I know I've been on it.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.407
Just stop watching
it right now.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.142
It gets worse.

10:42.175 --> 10:47.280
-I went on a mission for my
church, and I was in Spain.

10:47.314 --> 10:50.150
And all of a sudden, one
day I get this letter.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.821
And it says, your movie's out.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.722
And it's

10:54.755 --> 10:56.790
called "Troll 2." -Damn.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.225
There's no milk.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.160
There's no coffee.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.729
There's nothing.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.764
Guys, didn't anyone remember
to bring supplies?

11:03.797 --> 11:08.168
-And the first time that I saw
it, it was embarrassing.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.238
I've got to admit, it was
embarrassing because m acting

11:11.271 --> 11:13.006
was horrible.

11:13.040 --> 11:18.946
And I think I maybe hoped it
wouldn't be as bad as it was.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.413
But it was.

11:20.447 --> 11:25.485
(SINGING) I'd like to dance
with you, honey.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.989
I'd like to have romance.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.357
I was in a crappy movie.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.860
And I'm a crappy actor.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.995
And that's OK because it's
not my thing that I do.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.163
I do music.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.798
I don't need to run
from this film.

11:37.831 --> 11:42.770
But I can understand like Darren
and Connie and maybe

11:42.803 --> 11:46.940
some of the other ones that do
acting and are trying to make

11:46.974 --> 11:50.911
a career of acting, how they,
for a time, would try to just

11:50.944 --> 11:52.379
kind of brush this away.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.915
Who wants to put "Troll 2" on
their resume, you know?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.483
If someone pulls it out
and watches it, you're

11:56.516 --> 11:57.885
not getting the part.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.753
-Oh, I think I recognize you.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.889
Did you do a movie
about goblins

12:01.922 --> 12:03.290
or trolls or something?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.993
And there's that part of
you that wants to lie.

12:06.026 --> 12:06.960
It's not on my resume.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.528
You know?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.230
But then you're like, oh, I
shouldn't lie, because I he'll

12:10.263 --> 12:11.832
just look me up.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.334
And so you go, uh-huh, and
leaving knowing I'm not

12:14.367 --> 12:18.772
getting hired because of that.

12:18.806 --> 12:19.973
-[groans]

12:20.007 --> 12:21.141
-Release your instincts
in the bathroom!

12:21.174 --> 12:22.342
-Are you nuts?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.912
Are you trying to turn
me into a homo?

12:24.945 --> 12:26.446
-It wouldn't be too hard.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.416
If my father discovers you here,
he'd cut off your little

12:29.449 --> 12:30.550
nuts and eat them.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.020
He can't stand you.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.154
-I was horrible in it.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.256
And I knew I was
horrible in it.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.359
And I was, like, devastated as a
little kid who's just like--

12:39.392 --> 12:40.527
you know?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.462
Well, I was a pre-teen,
even worse.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.933
And I was just thinking,
oh, my gosh.

12:45.966 --> 12:49.236
I suck.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.971
I looked it up on--

12:51.004 --> 12:54.441
on IMDb, and it was like one of
those slow motion moments

12:54.474 --> 12:57.244
when you look down and you
see, like, the ratings.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
And it says, worst
movie ever made.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.281
And then I clicked
on Comments.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.551
That was a bad move.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.286
They're not just saying, that's
a horrible movie.

13:06.319 --> 13:11.091
They're saying, you are a
horrible actor in the movie.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.125
So it's not just the movie.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.094
It's you too.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.330
So it is personal.

13:17.364 --> 13:22.169
From the moment I saw it the
first time on HBO, from that

13:22.202 --> 13:25.906
very moment, I was like, oh,
I just want it to go away.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.607
I just want it to go away.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.046
CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): We can do
Holly's scene with the

13:33.080 --> 13:34.915
boyfriend coming
in the window.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.450
-I don't know that one.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.886
Are you Holly?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.287
-Sure.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.521
-I could be Holly.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.923
-[groans]

13:42.956 --> 13:45.292
-Release your instincts
in the bathroom!

13:45.325 --> 13:46.860
-Are you trying to turn
me into a homo?

13:46.894 --> 13:47.627
Are you crazy?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.229
-It wouldn't be too hard.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.132
If my father discovers you
here, he'll cut off your

13:52.165 --> 13:53.166
little nuts and eat them.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.168
He can't stand you.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.069
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
This is an

13:56.103 --> 13:57.204
Atkins Research Program.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.371
We're a marketing research
company.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.407
We do focus groups and
also mock trials

14:00.440 --> 14:02.509
for the general public.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.178
Today, we are throwing
a "Troll 2" party.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.479
We hold this annually.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.649
And we're very proud
of what we do.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.153
-I first saw the movie
when my friend Chris

14:13.186 --> 14:14.121
introduced it to me.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.655
We were at my house.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.390
And he said, there's this
movie you've got to see.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.193
I've watched it a million
times on VHS.

14:20.227 --> 14:23.063
The most awful, worn,
used, dated copy.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.599
But we popped it in, and it
was pure genius and joy.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.002
We watched it a second
time right away.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.203
-The movie came right
to video.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.105
And my dad knew I loved
horror films.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.606
So he rented it for me,
and he came over.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.275
We would hang out every day.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.077
And this was back in Detroit,
where we're both from.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.946
And we watched the movie, and
then I showed it to my cousin.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.413
And my cousin made fun of it.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.949
He's like, it's the worst movie
ever, ever made. (HIGH

14:41.982 --> 14:43.016
PITCHED) Nilbog.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.517
It's goblin spelled backwards.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.418
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): We just
started watching it over and

14:45.452 --> 14:46.987
over and over again.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.355
Every time we watched it,
we brought a new person.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.158
Before you knew it, we
had groups of 10, and

14:51.191 --> 14:52.926
then groups of 15.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.694
And then we said, you know,
we've got to do this annually.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.964
-Well, this is our fifth party.

14:56.997 --> 14:57.530
-Fifth.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.431
-Because we--

14:58.465 --> 15:00.067
last year, we had two.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.134
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
And it gets bigger every

15:01.168 --> 15:02.135
single time.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.136
CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): It does.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.137
-Who hasn't seen the movie?

15:04.171 --> 15:04.938
Who has not seen the movie?

15:04.972 --> 15:05.672
Aha.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.207
You've seen the movie.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.076
So we're putting these
on everybody who are

15:09.109 --> 15:11.945
virgins to the movie.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.146
-I'm flowered.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.951
-I've seen the movie.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.352
-Have you seen it?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.688
Aw, I'm so sorry, sweetie.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.491
-I don't know anything about
the movie other than I've

15:24.524 --> 15:27.394
heard it's not the horror film
it's supposed to be, which is

15:27.427 --> 15:29.496
good because I don't
like horror films.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.564
-It came after "Troll," which
has nothing to do with "Troll

15:31.598 --> 15:33.633
2." There's not even trolls
in the movie.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.337
It's like, I'm going to go for
a run and get some milk.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.439
There's two guys shirtless
in the bed.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.473
And then the grandpa.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.042
The sister dance.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.712
It's so funny that there's
no way you're going

15:45.745 --> 15:48.515
to hate this movie.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.050
-OK.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.319
-I have tried to explain
"Troll 2" to people who

15:52.352 --> 15:53.520
haven't seen it.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.222
But words don't really
do it justice.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.257
You really do just have
to see the movie.

15:57.290 --> 16:01.128
Because I can tell you, well,
it's about a boy who goes on

16:01.161 --> 16:03.030
vacation with his family.

16:03.063 --> 16:07.200
And it turns out that everyone
there wants to turn them into

16:07.234 --> 16:08.668
plants to eat them.

16:08.701 --> 16:12.105
And his grandfather, who's dead,
is helping him on this

16:12.139 --> 16:14.041
quest to rescue his family.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.242
-Grandpa!

16:17.444 --> 16:19.312
-Um, it just doesn't sound very

16:19.346 --> 16:21.048
compelling to most people.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.283
And then they're kind of like,
oh, I'm really glad you're

16:23.316 --> 16:24.584
excited about that movie.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.718
It sounds great.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.420
But if you were actually
to see the

16:27.454 --> 16:29.522
film, I mean, you just--

16:29.556 --> 16:31.124
I feel like you wouldn't-- you'd
have to, like, not have

16:31.158 --> 16:34.494
a heart or something
to not like it.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.328
-Oh, my god.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.329
You didn't see it?

16:36.363 --> 16:37.097
-You haven't seen "Troll 2?"

16:37.130 --> 16:38.631
-Put it in now.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.033
No matter what you're doing,
you drop what you're doing.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.301
You go, oh, you haven't
seen "Troll 2?"

16:41.334 --> 16:42.735
We're watching it now.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.437
-I'll watch it with you, and
I watched it yesterday.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.040
And I'm excited it to
watch it today.

16:47.074 --> 16:50.043
-I watched it twice this
morning, but I'll watch it

16:50.077 --> 16:51.578
again with you right now.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.812
-I'll watch it again with you
because I know that you're

16:52.845 --> 16:54.181
going to love it.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.823
-Thank you all for coming tot
he fifth annual Los Angeles

17:03.856 --> 17:05.758
"Troll 2" party.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.694
[cheering]

17:07.727 --> 17:10.363
-I mean, I've heard people say
"Troll 2" is a religion.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.465
And that makes complete sense
to me because in a religion,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.468
what you're doing is you're
passing your religion on to

17:15.502 --> 17:17.137
other people.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.107
You're sharing what it is about
this that helps you and

17:20.140 --> 17:21.840
that, you know-- and that
moves you through life.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.542
And that's what people
do with this movie.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.578
They pass the DVD around
like it's the Bible.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.479
-All right.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.115
We're going to start.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.649
-By every conceivable measure,
this is a bad film.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.751
By every conceivable measure
that you've ever learned in

17:31.784 --> 17:33.420
film school, if you've seen five
movies in your lifetime.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.493
But again, it's all fun.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.630
I mean, you know, bad food is
bad, and bad books are bad.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.466
But bad movies are
not always bad.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.269
-You guys have, uh, "Troll 2?"

17:49.302 --> 17:52.372
-That is in the holy fucking
shit section.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.473
-The holy fucking
shit section.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.307
-Yeah, just right over here.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.542
-Both are on here.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.210
But it's pointing to
"Troll 2," right?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.479
-That's the one that deserves
the holy fucking shit.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.148
-OK.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.416
When I heard rumblings of "Troll
2" becoming more like a

18:03.450 --> 18:06.586
cult film and more popular, I
thought to myself, hey, there

18:06.619 --> 18:09.256
must be something to this.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.424
It says, hey, George, thank
you for adding me.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.327
I just wanted to let you know
that "Troll 2" is one of my

18:14.361 --> 18:16.129
favorite films of all time.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.566
Thank you for being a part
of cinematic history.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.503
You are a lucky man to have
acted in such a magical movie.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.637
Wow.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.306
Do you have 11 pages
of messages?

18:26.339 --> 18:27.574
-No.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.209
-Well, I do.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.212
And I've been on Myspace enough
time that you have.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.680
I said, is this really true?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.248
Is it really a cult
phenomenon?

18:35.282 --> 18:37.650
You know, I just found it
hard to believe that--

18:37.684 --> 18:40.287
that it really was
that popular.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.256
-We were supposed to do like a
routine here at UCB for a show

18:43.290 --> 18:45.725
called the It Sucked Awards.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.228
It's like a yearly roundup
of t things that sucked.

18:48.261 --> 18:51.731
And that George saw that a copy
of the "New York Times"

18:51.764 --> 18:54.667
with the little write up of,
and John Gemberling showed

18:54.701 --> 18:57.370
clips from "Troll 2," which
won, like, the It

18:57.404 --> 18:59.806
Sucked movie category.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.775
-And I said, hey, my name
is George Hardy.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.579
I'm from the movie "Troll 2."
And all of a sudden, I hear in

19:06.613 --> 19:08.181
the background, oh, my god.

19:08.215 --> 19:11.751
You guys, it's-- it's George
Hardy on the phone.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.354
-This is the most surreal
fucking thing I've ever

19:14.387 --> 19:15.455
experienced in my life.

19:15.488 --> 19:25.332
This is the dad from
"Troll 2."

19:25.365 --> 19:27.334
DARREN (OFFSCREEN): First
time in New York.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.335
Have you been here before?

19:28.368 --> 19:30.303
-I haven't.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.704
What time does the
thing start?

19:31.738 --> 19:33.306
-Uh, 9:00.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.308
-9:00?

19:35.342 --> 19:36.709
-I don't know.

19:36.743 --> 19:37.710
I don't know.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.711
I don't know what to expect.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.347
-I hear they sold out.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.782
I hear that the may even have
standing room only.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.252
I hear there may be people
turned away.

19:45.285 --> 19:51.391
-I put up one post on Myspace,
one, saying,

19:51.424 --> 19:53.326
we're having this screening.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.364
And within two days, I had
over 100 respondents.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.665
JOHN (OFFSCREEN): We
didn't do anything.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.832
CURTIS (OFFSCREEN): We
really did nothing.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.301
JOHN (OFFSCREEN): I
mean, we can't--

20:01.334 --> 20:02.001
CURTIS (OFFSCREEN): The
thing sold itself.

20:02.034 --> 20:02.769
We cannot take credit.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.470
-I came from LA.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.003
-Cape Cod.

20:04.036 --> 20:04.771
-New Jersey.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.539
-Connecticut.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.308
-This guy right here came all
the way from North Carolina.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.743
-We would've walked here for
this from West Virginia, man.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.514
-Just numbers wise, there were
the most people here that, up

20:14.547 --> 20:15.882
to that point, had ever--

20:15.915 --> 20:17.550
ever squeezed into the room.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.470
-The energy inside that place
was just amazing.

20:37.504 --> 20:41.874
-"Troll 2" is the best movie
in the world, the world.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.876
-It's unmatched by any movie.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.447
I've gone from movie store to
movie store to try and find

20:47.480 --> 20:50.450
another movie that even comes
close. "Troll 2" just blows

20:50.483 --> 20:51.684
them out of the water.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.587
-All these guys just
go, you rock, man.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.355
You rock.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.055
You're my hero.

20:56.088 --> 20:56.956
-I'm smitten right now.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.758
I'm speechless.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.861
-You would have thought that,
like, Robert De Niro had come

21:01.894 --> 21:03.363
into the building.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.864
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): They
want our autographs.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.466
They're shaking when
they see us.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.968
And I'm looking around,
just going, wow.

21:09.001 --> 21:09.902
Wow.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.304
This is bizarre.

21:14.541 --> 21:18.445
-It's just a new thing for me
to be signing autographs,

21:18.478 --> 21:21.581
signing girls' t-shirts, you
know, to be taking pictures

21:21.614 --> 21:23.316
with people.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.085
And in the back of my mind, I'd
be like going, I'm just in

21:26.118 --> 21:27.587
this crappy movie.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.657
-I think of the, you know,
shot composition,

21:30.690 --> 21:35.027
cinematography, acting,
directing, writing.

21:35.061 --> 21:41.968
Few movies fucked each of those
up completely and still

21:42.001 --> 21:44.103
retained their eminent
watch-ability.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.605
-Yes.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.739
-There's not even
a movie screen.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.641
It's like a projector screen.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.677
There's a column,
terribly placed.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.544
-It's a horrible place
to watch a movie

21:51.578 --> 21:52.745
-In eye line.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.780
-It is like one of the
worst places to

21:53.813 --> 21:55.648
try to watch a movie.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.116
But people loved it.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.718
FEMALE SPEAKER (IN MOVIE): Don't
tell my father, but he's

21:58.751 --> 21:59.886
coming with us tomorrow.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.554
[laughter]

22:01.588 --> 22:03.956
-It's really hard to fathom that
this film, that was shot

22:03.990 --> 22:08.060
for a couple $100,000, 17 years
later is being played to

22:08.094 --> 22:09.862
300 adoring fans.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.999
[applause]

22:13.032 --> 22:13.966
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): My
heart is beating,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.002
like, 100 miles a minute.

22:16.035 --> 22:19.806
People clapping and people
cheering and throwing their

22:19.839 --> 22:21.007
arms up and yelling.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.013
And I just thought,
you know what?

22:27.046 --> 22:28.448
Just go out there and
have fun with these

22:28.481 --> 22:29.849
folks, you know, tonight.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.818
[chanting]

22:41.093 --> 22:43.029
-Let's see, um, OK.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.597
You can't piss on--

22:44.631 --> 22:46.566
[cheering]

22:51.938 --> 22:52.539
AUDIENCE (OFFSCREEN): Come on!

22:52.572 --> 22:53.706
Come on!

22:56.543 --> 22:57.877
AUDIENCE (OFFSCREEN):
Tighten that belt!

22:57.910 --> 22:59.479
-I can't really tighten
my belt.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.580
AUDIENCE (OFFSCREEN): [shouts]

23:00.613 --> 23:01.848
-You can't piss on
hospitality!

23:01.881 --> 23:02.849
I won't allow it!

23:02.882 --> 23:04.851
[cheering]

23:08.888 --> 23:10.623
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): These
people were going nuts.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.524
They were applauding.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.992
They were going crazy.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.061
I don't feel that kind
of feeling when

23:15.094 --> 23:17.063
I'm drilling a cavity.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.165
It's when you're walking on
stage, and you've got 300

23:19.198 --> 23:20.833
adoring fans go crazy
over you.

23:24.070 --> 23:24.871
It was ama--

23:24.904 --> 23:26.839
I was amazed.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.140
I had no clue.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.209
And then I knew it was--

23:30.242 --> 23:31.578
there was something to this.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.646
It was a cult phenomenon.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.717
-Two decades after it was made,
"Troll 2" is finally

23:37.750 --> 23:38.885
finding an audience.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.053
And the fans are
not necessarily

23:41.087 --> 23:42.655
all completely crazy.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.728
-I'd always wanted to see "Troll
2" in a theater, but

23:48.761 --> 23:49.996
I'd never thought
it would happen.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.898
We had really hoped that
it would sell out.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.667
But it actually ended up being
about over 100 people that

23:54.701 --> 23:57.236
couldn't even make it
into the theater.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.239
-I have never seen a line that
far around the Alamo.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.240
It's crazy.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.809
-It is sold out for tonight.

24:02.842 --> 24:06.178
-This is unbelievable.

24:06.212 --> 24:11.718
-This film is like aliens saw
what movies were like from our

24:11.751 --> 24:14.487
transmissions, and then they
tried to make a film

24:14.521 --> 24:16.088
themselves that Earthlings
would like.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.667
-We'd all found "Troll
2" on our own.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.069
We'd watch it every
single weekend.

24:30.102 --> 24:34.073
-I saw it at least seven times
in the first week after being

24:34.106 --> 24:35.542
introduced to it.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.043
-Everyone had to become
obsessed with it.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.244
We'd brainwashed them into it.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.250
-My friends and I thought we
were like the only people in

24:44.283 --> 24:46.052
the world who knew about this.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.820
-Oh, my god.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.657
-Getting to meet some of these
guys was really a pleasure.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.659
And George Hardy, I think
I'll probably

24:52.692 --> 24:53.860
stalk for several months.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.030
-"Troll 2," ladies
and gentlemen.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.632
-Enjoy it.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.634
[cheering]

25:04.637 --> 25:05.605
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Hey,
nice to meet you.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.006
-I love you.

25:07.039 --> 25:16.616
-If you're unhappy, just
watch "Troll 2."

25:16.649 --> 25:19.586
-(CHANTING) "Troll 2,"
"Troll 2," "Troll 2."

25:19.619 --> 25:20.987
-You're so awesome.

25:21.020 --> 25:25.592
I brought the VHS, the original,
because I am a

25:25.625 --> 25:27.594
goblin in disguise.

25:27.627 --> 25:38.971
-I love "Troll 2!"

25:39.005 --> 25:40.006
-Yeah!

25:40.039 --> 25:41.574
-It's time to watch the movie.

25:41.608 --> 25:42.742
Come on in.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.943
-And you can't piss
on hospitality.

25:43.976 --> 25:44.944
I won't allow it!

25:44.977 --> 25:46.946
-I won't allow it!

25:46.979 --> 25:48.948
[cheering]

25:53.385 --> 25:57.089
-You just never realize that it
reached as many people as

25:57.123 --> 25:57.924
it did.

25:57.957 --> 25:58.658
-Nice to meet you.

25:58.691 --> 25:59.058
Oh, my god.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.928
Wow.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.329
-It's the happiest
night of my life.

26:11.370 --> 26:15.341
-Your friend and mine, the rich
man's Craig T Nelson,

26:15.374 --> 26:16.943
George Hardy!

26:16.976 --> 26:18.911
[applause]

26:26.919 --> 26:28.287
-Mr. George Hardy!

26:28.320 --> 26:30.289
[applause]

26:33.926 --> 26:36.696
-What's weird though-- and it--
and it's the reason the

26:36.729 --> 26:37.396
movie's great.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.297
You guys are so genuine.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.298
-He's so sincere.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.667
He's so genuine.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.269
He's exactly why we
love "Troll 2."

26:43.302 --> 26:47.874
-I'm sure George Hardy is a
great dentist, but I respect

26:47.907 --> 26:49.075
him as an actor.

26:57.917 --> 27:02.889
-You know the trouble with
being psychologically

27:02.922 --> 27:06.726
disturbed is that
no matter how--

27:06.759 --> 27:10.663
how you get out of it and get
back to normalcy, as soon as

27:10.697 --> 27:14.200
you tell people you had mental
problems, they still treat you

27:14.233 --> 27:15.401
like you're nutty.

27:18.871 --> 27:22.274
I walked in ever decreasing
concentric circles until I

27:22.308 --> 27:25.812
found my head up my ass.

27:25.845 --> 27:29.882
I was sitting in my house on
13th East, and I couldn't

27:29.916 --> 27:32.685
decide whether to have
a hard boiled egg, a

27:32.719 --> 27:34.721
scrambled egg, or eggs.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.923
I couldn't make that decision.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.258
I was there, stuck.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.061
And a friend said, let me take
you to the hospital.

27:42.094 --> 27:46.032
And they took me right in.

27:46.065 --> 27:48.801
You know, I like to drive
without a seat belt.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.704
I really like the feeling of
driving without a seat belt.

27:54.273 --> 27:59.345
I was in the mental hospital at
the University of Utah, and

27:59.378 --> 28:02.214
they gave me days
off to go out.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.916
I called my agent.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.485
She said, they're shooting a
movie out in Park City, an

28:06.518 --> 28:08.287
Italian film company.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.922
And you go out there.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.958
I won't charge you if
you get the part.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.092
I went there.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.127
They said, come back again.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.029
And when I came back, they
said, the person who was

28:17.063 --> 28:19.131
supposed to do it
didn't show up.

28:19.165 --> 28:20.332
So you can do it.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.275
-Can I help you?

28:29.308 --> 28:30.943
-Coffee.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.444
-There's no coffee
here in Nilbog.

28:32.478 --> 28:35.481
It's the devil's drink.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.283
-Eggs.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.285
-[grunts]

28:39.318 --> 28:42.088
-You know, this is me.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.390
This is who I am.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.058
It's--

28:46.092 --> 28:48.360
you know, it's-- you know a lot
about people by the-- by

28:48.394 --> 28:51.397
the toys they have.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.799
These are my people.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.302
These are my people.

28:58.805 --> 29:01.373
If they were to run for office,
I'd vote for them.

29:01.407 --> 29:05.277
I smoked an enormous amount
of pot then to stay sane.

29:05.311 --> 29:08.214
And when I got on the set, I had
no idea what it all meant

29:08.247 --> 29:10.449
or what I was doing or
what I was saying.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.451
I don't know where we
went or what we did.

29:12.484 --> 29:16.388
And I have no idea of what
the total movie was.

29:16.422 --> 29:20.092
And I didn't see it until
20 years later.

29:20.126 --> 29:24.964
And I was amazed how
creepy I looked.

29:24.997 --> 29:29.068
I looked at that person,
who looked like this.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.537
And I realized I was
really troubled.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.906
I wasn't acting, I could
tell you that.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.174
I wasn't acting.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.477
That was a troubled
person talking.

29:38.510 --> 29:41.547
It was a terrible experience,
making that movie.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.249
It was always cold.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.051
It was always remote.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.587
And I remember there was a
little kid there, a little

29:48.620 --> 29:51.423
Mormon kid who was really
a pain in the ass.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.861
And he was the star, and
I wanted to kill him.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.997
And I was in the scene with him
where I said, try this.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.431
You'll like it.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.868
And I really wanted to feed
him that green stuff.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.837
I wanted to grab his head
and put it in it.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.605
I just couldn't stand him.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.212
The dentist, the one who played
the father was the

30:13.245 --> 30:16.048
Southern accent, called me.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.850
That's how I found
out about it.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.018
I was in the audience.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.153
I didn't want to go
up on the stage.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.256
-Don Packard showed up and was
sitting in the audience.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.925
-Yeah.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.026
He wasn't even, like,
necessarily wanting to be part

30:27.059 --> 30:28.160
of the Q&A.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.595
-We had to, like,
go and ask him.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.363
And he was like, oh, you want
me to-- oh, uh, OK.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.866
-Like, you flew to New York
just to watch this?

30:33.900 --> 30:37.503
-And the woman sitting next to
me said, you were great.

30:37.536 --> 30:38.871
She kept saying,
you were great.

30:38.905 --> 30:39.438
I--

30:39.471 --> 30:40.439
I was won over.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.041
-This is pretty incredible.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.275
I'm pretty giddy about it.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.978
Would the owner of the
general store--

30:46.012 --> 30:47.980
[cheering]

30:53.019 --> 30:53.419
-And I--

30:53.452 --> 30:54.921
I just--

30:54.954 --> 30:56.455
I went like this, and
everybody applauded.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.090
I was thrilled.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.225
I went like this.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.527
They all applauded
when I came out.

31:01.560 --> 31:05.097
And somehow, I was freed.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.565
I wasn't self conscious.

31:06.598 --> 31:09.668
It was really a golden
experience for me.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.048
I never felt that good in
all my life, really.

31:22.081 --> 31:26.052
I never was thrilled at being
who I was until that moment

31:26.085 --> 31:27.253
in-- in Manhattan.

31:35.427 --> 31:40.232
-Hello, my name is Mr. K. I'm
somewhere here in Austria in

31:40.266 --> 31:42.001
the middle of the woods.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.070
I'm not just cold,
I'm freezing.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.005
And I'm a troll.

31:46.038 --> 31:46.973
What else?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.507
I'm going to eat you.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.410
[growls]

31:51.443 --> 31:55.181
-My name is Kacper Radecki I'm
a "Troll 2" fan, and I live

31:55.214 --> 31:56.415
here in Austria.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.485
My desk in school is
full of "Troll 2."

31:59.518 --> 32:05.091
-I'm so excited that a movie can
mean that much to people

32:05.124 --> 32:07.293
without being pushed into it.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.728
The-- the audiences of
"Troll 2" had to have

32:09.761 --> 32:11.363
found it on their own.

32:11.397 --> 32:15.267
They had to be probably a
certain type of person who

32:15.301 --> 32:21.473
would rent videos that they've
never heard of and someone who

32:21.507 --> 32:23.976
watches movies more than once.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.212
-"Troll 2" is something
very special.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.115
It's a movie you can watch
1,000 times, and

32:29.148 --> 32:30.149
it won't get boring.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.985
It's just so perfectly bad.

32:33.019 --> 32:36.755
-I realized there's nothing more
intelligent that I could

32:36.788 --> 32:40.326
do as a 31-year-old man than
get a "Troll 2" tattoo.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.298
-I can't stand tattoos.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.499
But--

32:51.703 --> 32:53.172
JESSE (OFFSCREEN): It's
so interactive.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.541
You, um, personalize the film.

32:55.574 --> 32:58.510
And you take some sort
of ownership.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.080
-We bought a kit to make
actually like a profession

33:01.113 --> 33:02.048
latex mask.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.182
-Yeah, we like--

33:03.215 --> 33:04.216
-It's the first time,
you know.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.084
We'd never sculpted anything.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.252
-We'd never done it.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.219
I've never sculpted
any clay before.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.259
-It took about six weeks
to complete.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.061
We didn't know how it was going
to turn out, you know,

33:15.094 --> 33:17.196
being the first time we
made these costumes.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.731
-It turned out really well.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.668
-If I could get everyone's
attention, we're going to

33:22.701 --> 33:24.436
start the Trollympic game.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.806
So any-- everyone who wants to
participate, just come over

33:27.839 --> 33:28.407
here.

33:28.440 --> 33:29.408
-Go!

33:32.611 --> 33:33.379
-I would always invite
people over to watch

33:33.412 --> 33:34.780
"Troll 2" with me.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.648
So I don't know if that would
count as a party.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.251
But actual, like, official
"Troll 2" parties--

33:39.285 --> 33:40.452
this is my third.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.727
-Hi, my name's Adam Kourelis.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.298
I'm the one that brought
"Troll 2" to Iraq.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.267
-What I learned from this movie
is that whenever someone

33:55.301 --> 33:57.269
goes like this towards me, I--

33:57.303 --> 33:58.437
I--

33:58.470 --> 33:59.271
I won't eat whatever
they give me.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.376
-I basically made the
"Troll 2" video game

34:04.410 --> 34:06.745
because I love the movie.

34:06.778 --> 34:07.779
And I just--

34:07.813 --> 34:09.547
I wanted to make a good game.

34:09.581 --> 34:10.315
All right.

34:10.349 --> 34:11.483
We're at Nilbog.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.485
I'm shooting double
decker baloney

34:13.518 --> 34:16.155
sandwiches at the goblins.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.324
These are the strong ones.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.658
Yeah.

34:19.690 --> 34:23.228
-My friend Steve, also
a venue artist here--

34:23.262 --> 34:26.165
I showed him "Troll 2" probably
about like a year and

34:26.197 --> 34:28.667
a half ago, right around the
time we were starting "Guitar

34:28.699 --> 34:31.837
Hero II." And he made, you know,
one of his levels the

34:31.870 --> 34:32.871
high school gym.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.473
And he called it Nilbog High.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.342
You know, and we-- we all
that thought was great.

34:36.375 --> 34:41.147
-I actually wrote the, uh,
sequel, "Troll 2, Monstrous

34:41.179 --> 34:43.681
Beings." This is a
close figure on

34:43.715 --> 34:44.616
the side of the road.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.751
Michael gets on the CB.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.518
And he says, hey,
son, to Elliott.

34:47.553 --> 34:48.754
Elliott says, yes, dad.

34:48.786 --> 34:49.521
I hate--

34:49.554 --> 34:51.257
I hate to see--

34:51.290 --> 34:53.559
-If this movie is resonating so
strongly with all of these

34:53.592 --> 34:56.295
people, what is beneath the
surface that is this kind of

34:56.328 --> 35:01.300
unconscious thing that is
getting under our skin?

35:01.333 --> 35:03.469
-I don't think it's the
worst film ever made.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.638
I have seen worse
films than this.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.474
But it's--

35:08.507 --> 35:09.641
it's not necessarily
that it's bad.

35:09.675 --> 35:10.609
It's odd.

35:10.642 --> 35:11.543
It's really odd.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.312
It doesn't make sense.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.148
And it's like, a lot of bad
movies, you get the impression

35:16.182 --> 35:16.882
that people that make them
just didn't know

35:16.915 --> 35:18.617
how to make a film.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.553
This is like the people knew
how to make a film but had

35:21.587 --> 35:23.555
suffered quite a heavy
blow to the head.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.491
-When the time comes,
you light the wick

35:25.524 --> 35:27.226
and throw the bottle.

35:27.259 --> 35:29.461
I'll create some confusion
with this.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.230
JESSE (OFFSCREEN):
It's genuine.

35:31.263 --> 35:36.702
There's no irony going on, a
film that genuinely expresses

35:36.735 --> 35:41.473
a story, a totally whacked
story too.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.310
-There's sandwiches for
tonight in here.

35:44.343 --> 35:48.380
It will go easier
if you eat them.

35:48.414 --> 35:52.218
-The best bad movies are not
deliberately bad, always.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.187
You know, like, the most fondly
remembered stinkers are

35:55.221 --> 35:57.723
the movies that people went all
out, and they tried their

35:57.756 --> 35:59.291
best and totally failed,
but gloriously.

36:02.294 --> 36:05.664
-What we want from a film
is honesty and--

36:05.697 --> 36:07.366
and sincerity.

36:07.399 --> 36:08.734
We want to feel like these
people really care about what

36:08.767 --> 36:10.869
they're making, even if
it is really awful.

36:10.902 --> 36:14.773
That's why Ed Wood is still so
highly regarded, because Ed

36:14.806 --> 36:16.708
Wood wasn't just making trash.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.211
He really believed in
what he was making.

36:19.245 --> 36:20.446
And that makes a
big difference.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.980
You know, I see some
of these films.

36:22.013 --> 36:22.848
And I think, these are people
who have just thrown this

36:22.881 --> 36:24.316
together cynically.

36:24.350 --> 36:34.393
But there isn't a cynicism
in "Troll 2."

36:34.393 --> 36:44.403
But there isn't a cynicism
in "Troll 2."

37:10.462 --> 37:12.398
[suspenseful music playing]

39:47.686 --> 39:49.621

-Oh, boy.

41:20.846 --> 41:23.982
What attention, what suspense.

41:34.225 --> 41:35.927
-It's Claudio.

41:35.961 --> 41:39.230
Scott, I want to
introduce you.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.065
Scott, Claudio.

41:40.098 --> 41:40.932
-How are you?

41:40.966 --> 41:41.533
Nice to meet you.

41:41.567 --> 41:42.067
-Good.

41:42.100 --> 41:42.901
How are you?

41:42.934 --> 41:43.669
-Fine.

41:43.702 --> 41:44.636
-It's an honor.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.772
I'm a huge fan, huge fan.

41:46.805 --> 41:49.107
I saw this movie
when I was 15.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.075
-No.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.209
-Yeah.

41:51.242 --> 41:52.844
Now, um, I produce
horror movies.

41:52.878 --> 41:56.915
So it's amazing.

41:56.948 --> 41:59.250
-Yes.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.819
-Yes, absolutely.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.187
-So good to see you again.

42:02.220 --> 42:02.954
-I remember.

42:02.988 --> 42:03.822
-Oh, of course.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.223
Of course.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.192
Yes, you yelled at me a lot.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.193
-Oh, Chris.

42:08.226 --> 42:09.595
-Do you remember me?

42:13.765 --> 42:14.700
-So we're all here.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.101
It's pretty great.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.103
-In LA, yeah?

42:18.136 --> 42:20.939
-Yeah, right here
in Los Angeles.

42:20.972 --> 42:21.907
-That's it, yeah.

42:21.940 --> 42:22.908
You're right in it.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.109
You're right here.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.782
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): This is
pretty good, pretty good.

42:30.816 --> 42:31.850
-Hello, how are you?

42:31.883 --> 42:32.618
Fine.

42:32.651 --> 42:33.785
-How you doing?

42:33.819 --> 42:35.687
-Have you seen this
movie before?

42:35.721 --> 42:36.121
-Yeah.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.088
Yeah.

42:37.122 --> 42:37.856
-What you think about it?

42:37.889 --> 42:38.857
-What was that?

42:38.890 --> 42:40.225
-What do you think about it?

42:40.258 --> 42:41.793
-Oh, we have a great time
watching this movie.

42:41.827 --> 42:43.061
Oh, yeah.

42:43.094 --> 42:43.829
-Ciao.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.631
Bye, bye.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.365
-"Troll 2." Yeah.

42:47.398 --> 42:48.767
-Did you see the movie?

42:48.800 --> 42:49.868
-Yeah, it was awesome.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.136
-What do you think about it?

42:51.169 --> 42:52.070
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
It's amazing.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.071
-It's amazing?

42:53.104 --> 42:54.072
-It's a miracle.

42:54.105 --> 42:55.641
I love it. "Troll 2." Woo!

43:15.393 --> 43:19.030
-Grandpa Seth has been gone for
more than six months now.

43:19.064 --> 43:21.900
You were at the funeral,
and I know it was very

43:21.933 --> 43:23.301
difficult for you.

43:23.334 --> 43:26.738
It was also very difficult
for your father and for

43:26.772 --> 43:28.707
Holly and for me--

43:28.740 --> 43:30.642
[laughter]

44:10.448 --> 44:14.352
-Every single bad movie out
there wants to be this film.

44:14.385 --> 44:18.456
It wants to be "Troll 2." Most
bad movies only have, like,

44:18.489 --> 44:21.693
two redeeming qualities or a
couple of scenes you share

44:21.727 --> 44:22.961
with your friends.

44:22.994 --> 44:25.296
The thing with "Troll
2," it delivers

44:25.330 --> 44:27.198
through the entire film.

44:27.232 --> 44:28.867
[laughter]

44:28.900 --> 44:34.205
-Um, we have about 90%, I
believe, of the cast here.

44:34.239 --> 44:36.141
[applause]

44:39.110 --> 44:40.445
-We have the director.

44:40.478 --> 44:42.380
[cheering]

45:09.474 --> 45:11.777
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Why is
the movie called "Troll 2"

45:11.810 --> 45:14.145
when there are zero trolls
in the movie?

45:14.179 --> 45:16.081
-[speaking italian]

45:21.352 --> 45:23.789
-I don't understand it.

45:23.822 --> 45:28.193
-Why is the movie called "Troll
2," and there are no

45:28.226 --> 45:29.895
trolls in the film?

45:48.079 --> 45:49.815
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): How does
it feel that you were the

45:49.848 --> 45:52.083
director of the worst
movie ever made?

45:52.117 --> 45:55.053
-I feel I didn't do
the worst movie.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.422
I did a very good movie.

45:57.455 --> 46:03.929
If they all say, worst
movie, ah, them

46:03.962 --> 46:05.563
problem, not my problem.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.967
My problem is to shoot
a lot of movies.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.869
I want to shoot a
lot of movies.

46:10.902 --> 46:11.970
I can't--

46:12.003 --> 46:13.171
I can't stop.

46:34.192 --> 46:35.961
[country music playing]

46:48.639 --> 46:52.343
-The old house is pretty much
the same thing, except it's

46:52.377 --> 46:55.113
run down a lot more.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.983
But it was run down
quite a bit then.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.118
-They picked the right house.

47:00.151 --> 47:02.220
-I guarantee you, there's some
mental insanity here, some

47:02.253 --> 47:04.022
mental insanity.

47:04.055 --> 47:12.964
So this is really the perfect
spot for "Troll 2." I

47:12.998 --> 47:14.199
remember, I come
out like this.

47:14.232 --> 47:15.633
ROBERT (OFFSCREEN):
How are you doing?

47:15.666 --> 47:18.469
-And I come out and kind
of go, oh, god.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.305
And then I go--

47:20.338 --> 47:21.506
and for some reason--

47:28.113 --> 47:30.348
-OK, OK.

47:30.381 --> 47:32.017
-How-- question.

47:32.050 --> 47:34.986
I can remember sitting down with
Michael and Connie and

47:35.020 --> 47:37.355
Margo, and we would
take the script.

47:37.388 --> 47:40.325
And we would try to decipher
what it meant.

47:40.358 --> 47:45.330
We would sit there for hours,
looking at this script and try

47:45.363 --> 47:47.465
to do, you know, an analysis
on the scenes.

47:47.498 --> 47:49.200
And we couldn't do it.

47:49.234 --> 47:52.670
How did I know that there was
a fire extinguisher right

47:52.703 --> 47:54.039
there the whole time?

47:59.610 --> 48:01.212
-And I thought, well,
this guy's famous.

48:01.246 --> 48:02.948
He knows what the
hell he's doing.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.382
And I mean, I was
just, whatever.

48:04.415 --> 48:05.516
You know?

48:05.550 --> 48:07.585
[laughing]

48:07.618 --> 48:09.520
-We sat out here on this curb
in front of the house--

48:09.554 --> 48:11.356
Connie and I-- during
our break.

48:11.389 --> 48:12.590
And we were looking
at this script.

48:12.623 --> 48:14.459
And she said, I'm really
uncomfortable

48:14.492 --> 48:16.261
with the nuts line.

48:16.294 --> 48:19.630
We came up with something that
was, uh, we thought, more PG.

48:19.664 --> 48:21.699
Then we tracked down Claudio,
and we said, Claudio, we

48:21.732 --> 48:24.335
really think this will
work better.

48:24.369 --> 48:25.503
It's a little more PG.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.105
This is how American
teenagers talk.

48:27.138 --> 48:30.641
And he said, I know how American
teenagers talk.

48:30.675 --> 48:33.044
This is how American
teenagers talk.

48:33.078 --> 48:34.079
-That's not how you do that.

48:34.112 --> 48:35.246
That's not American.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.481
And he would always
say that to me.

48:36.514 --> 48:38.016
I don't know if he said
that to you a lot.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.985
But he would always tell
me what was American.

48:40.018 --> 48:41.987
[music playing]

48:49.394 --> 48:51.496
-There was a lot of times I've
seen they were trying to add

48:51.529 --> 48:54.365
something or trying to make
it seem a little bit

48:54.399 --> 48:55.533
more natural to us.

48:55.566 --> 48:58.203
But it-- it--

48:58.236 --> 49:02.173
he had a real-- you know, had
a real vision of what he

49:02.207 --> 49:03.508
wanted to see.

49:03.541 --> 49:06.544
-Michael, who are the goblins?

49:06.577 --> 49:07.445
No, no, I say--

49:07.478 --> 49:08.113
-Who are the goblins?

49:08.146 --> 49:09.014
-I say--

49:09.047 --> 49:10.281
I say like, Michael--

49:13.484 --> 49:15.486
you can-- you are an actor.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.221
You cannot laugh.

49:16.254 --> 49:16.754
-OK.

49:16.787 --> 49:17.455
I will not.

49:17.488 --> 49:18.356
I will not.

49:18.389 --> 49:19.124
-You must be serious.

49:19.157 --> 49:19.657
OK?

49:19.690 --> 49:20.625
-All right.

49:20.658 --> 49:24.229
-Say, who are the goblins?

49:24.262 --> 49:25.430
-The goblins?

49:35.273 --> 49:37.508
-That was nice.

49:37.542 --> 49:40.545
-For the goblins, they weren't
looking for talent.

49:40.578 --> 49:43.514
You know, we didn't even have
to match the brilliant level

49:43.548 --> 49:45.716
of acting that was going on
in the rest of the film.

49:45.750 --> 49:47.085
They just--

49:47.118 --> 49:48.153
they were just looking
at heights.

49:48.186 --> 49:49.587
-I remember them
putting this--

49:49.620 --> 49:53.491
almost like a burlap
bag shirt on us.

49:53.524 --> 49:55.193
And they put gloves on us.

49:55.226 --> 49:59.230
And the gloves were way
longer than my hands.

49:59.264 --> 50:03.701
And so they kind of would tape
them on to the burlap bag.

50:03.734 --> 50:06.371
I had no clue what the
movie was about.

50:06.404 --> 50:09.074
-It was kind of hard to get a
straight answer as to exactly

50:09.107 --> 50:11.709
what the nature of
the project was.

50:11.742 --> 50:13.544
But we were excited.

50:13.578 --> 50:15.213
We were told it was
low budget.

50:15.246 --> 50:18.049
But, you know, we-- we know that
low budget is kind of a

50:18.083 --> 50:19.350
relative term.

50:19.384 --> 50:21.119
After a few days, we
realized this was

50:21.152 --> 50:23.421
really, really low budget.

50:23.454 --> 50:27.592
And by, I think it was probably
three days into

50:27.625 --> 50:28.759
shooting that we kind of--

50:28.793 --> 50:30.361
-You will remember
the director.

50:30.395 --> 50:31.096
-Yes.

50:31.129 --> 50:32.330
Oh, Claudio.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.065
-How are you?

50:34.099 --> 50:36.201
-As we started shooting more
and more, it started to get

50:36.234 --> 50:38.469
more confusing rather
than less.

50:38.503 --> 50:41.739
And it was like each day we were
on the set, we knew less

50:41.772 --> 50:44.075
about what this movie was
actually supposed to be.

50:44.109 --> 50:47.212
-And action.

50:47.245 --> 50:48.413
-You see this writing?

50:52.350 --> 50:53.651
[laughing]

50:53.684 --> 50:54.552
CLAUDIO (OFFSCREEN): Come
on, say the line!

50:54.585 --> 50:55.786
-You know what it means?

50:58.656 --> 50:59.790
Hospitality!

51:05.363 --> 51:06.731
And you can't piss
on hospitality.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.299
I won't allow it!

51:08.333 --> 51:09.567
-What are you going to
do to me, daddy?

51:09.600 --> 51:11.302
-OK, Joshua.

51:11.336 --> 51:12.870
You want to know what it feels
like to have hunger pains?

51:12.903 --> 51:15.406
Well, I'm tightening my belt
buckle by one notch so I don't

51:15.440 --> 51:17.375
feel hunger pains.

51:17.408 --> 51:18.709
[laughing]

51:18.743 --> 51:19.677
-No, no.

51:19.710 --> 51:20.678
Be serious.

51:20.711 --> 51:22.313
Repeat.

51:22.347 --> 51:24.715
-There was a recurring problem
on the set that was this

51:24.749 --> 51:27.418
language barrier that we
all had to deal with.

51:27.452 --> 51:28.653
-One of the Italian ADs--

51:28.686 --> 51:30.255
-Right.

51:30.288 --> 51:32.623
---said, if you would all please
to be following me

51:32.657 --> 51:34.259
upstairs now.

51:34.292 --> 51:35.560
And we were out there in the
middle of the canyon.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.694
There was no--

51:36.727 --> 51:37.828
there were no stairs
or anything.

51:37.862 --> 51:39.297
I mean, just going
up this slope.

51:47.772 --> 51:52.477
-When I call you, and I say
action, you come, and you do.

51:52.510 --> 51:54.445
You go around.

51:54.479 --> 51:56.614
Go around, and after,
you come up.

51:56.647 --> 51:57.748
OK.

51:57.782 --> 52:00.251
We start with one
with the other.

52:00.285 --> 52:01.152
Oh, eat.

52:01.186 --> 52:02.420
Oh, finally, we can eat.

52:02.453 --> 52:03.254
Oh, OK.

52:03.288 --> 52:04.755
Blah, blah, blah.

52:04.789 --> 52:07.658
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Claudio
speaks a lot better English

52:07.692 --> 52:09.394
than he did 18 years ago.

52:09.427 --> 52:10.528
I mean, there was no way we
could understand things like

52:10.561 --> 52:11.762
that last time he
worked with us.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.464
-I--

52:13.498 --> 52:15.900
I really couldn't understand
what they wanted me to do.

52:15.933 --> 52:17.568
-Open, open, open.

52:17.602 --> 52:18.469
Come on, come on.

52:18.503 --> 52:19.270
Open and say the line.

52:19.304 --> 52:19.904
Say the line.

52:19.937 --> 52:21.272
Say the line.

52:21.306 --> 52:23.374
-The Italians did kind
of annoy me.

52:23.408 --> 52:24.675
They're really intense.

52:24.709 --> 52:28.546
They were really intense
people, very bossy.

52:28.579 --> 52:31.382
I feel about as confused as I
did when we were doing it.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.250
-Come on.

52:32.283 --> 52:32.883
Don't talk with me.

52:32.917 --> 52:33.718
There is a camera.

52:33.751 --> 52:34.885
Don't laugh.

52:34.919 --> 52:36.487
Stay serious.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.423
-I had a yellow shirt, and
it had a logo on it and

52:38.456 --> 52:39.857
a logo on the back.

52:39.890 --> 52:41.859
But halfway through filming,
they lost my shirt.

52:41.892 --> 52:44.829
And we'd already filmed like
half of my scenes.

52:44.862 --> 52:46.331
And so they're like,
oh, that's fine.

52:46.364 --> 52:47.898
Go buy a yellow shirt.

52:47.932 --> 52:49.867
And I was just like, you want
me to buy the yellow shirt?

52:49.900 --> 52:51.869
I'm like, isn't there
like someone to go

52:51.902 --> 52:53.204
buy the yellow shirt?

52:53.238 --> 52:54.239
Isn't there someone
in wardrobe?

52:54.272 --> 52:54.939
They're like, no.

52:54.972 --> 52:56.341
Go buy a yellow shirt.

52:56.374 --> 52:57.542
-They took my shoes--

52:57.575 --> 53:00.745
mind you, my shoes, not
theirs, my black

53:00.778 --> 53:02.547
Converse high tops.

53:02.580 --> 53:05.950
And they screwed them into the
base of the pot, where I stood

53:05.983 --> 53:08.619
for almost 14 hours
in make up.

53:30.441 --> 53:32.009
-We really were trying
to make a good movie.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.411
We really were.

53:33.444 --> 53:37.415
Um, it just didn't turn
out that way.

53:37.448 --> 53:40.618
-I've always loved bad movies.

53:40.651 --> 53:42.453
And I always thought,
god, it'd be great

53:42.487 --> 53:43.988
to be in a bad movie.

53:44.021 --> 53:47.392
But I had no idea when I was
making it that I was making

53:47.425 --> 53:48.993
that bad a movie.

53:49.026 --> 53:52.830
So it's wonderful to find out
that yeah, I made a bad movie,

53:52.863 --> 53:56.000
a really bad movie that
got to be famous.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.307
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): This
is very familiar.

54:02.340 --> 54:05.410
You go up here and take a right,
go off to the right.

54:05.443 --> 54:07.945
I remember when I filmed "Troll
2," I would go pick up

54:07.978 --> 54:11.649
Margo and take her to the set.

54:11.682 --> 54:16.654
And so I kind of remember a
little bit of where she lives.

54:16.687 --> 54:22.827
It says, no trespassing except
for US mail, no dogs, no

54:22.860 --> 54:24.329
literature.

54:24.362 --> 54:26.331
Do not ring the bell except
by documented

54:26.364 --> 54:27.898
request by the owner.

54:27.932 --> 54:31.702
Violators will be prosecuted.

54:31.736 --> 54:33.304
Wow.

54:33.338 --> 54:33.871
Oh, god.

54:33.904 --> 54:34.705
This is crazy.

54:34.739 --> 54:35.540
What in the world?

54:35.573 --> 54:36.807
What are we doing?

54:36.841 --> 54:38.509
-What's the worst thing
that could happen?

54:38.543 --> 54:40.077
-That she comes to the door
with a gun, or she shoots

54:40.110 --> 54:41.879
through the door with a gun.

54:41.912 --> 54:43.481
I mean, she could have
mental issues.

54:43.514 --> 54:45.082
A bullet comes through
the door.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.951
-George, don't say that.

54:46.984 --> 54:48.919
-Well, that's the worst
that can happen.

54:48.953 --> 54:49.954
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN):
You want to do it?

54:49.987 --> 54:50.988
-Yeah, it's like pulling
a tooth.

54:51.021 --> 54:51.922
Let's just go ahead and do it.

54:59.664 --> 55:01.432
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Who is it?

55:01.466 --> 55:03.734
-It's Michael and--
and George Hardy.

55:03.768 --> 55:04.935
We--

55:04.969 --> 55:06.671
is it you, Margo?

55:06.704 --> 55:07.405
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

55:07.438 --> 55:07.938
-Hey, Margo.

55:07.972 --> 55:08.939
It's George.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.908
I was in "Troll 2" with you.

55:10.941 --> 55:11.642
-Hey.

55:11.676 --> 55:12.377
It's Margo.

55:12.410 --> 55:13.344
-Hey, Margo.

55:13.378 --> 55:14.044
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Oh, hi.

55:14.078 --> 55:15.646
What are you doing here?

55:15.680 --> 55:16.514
-We--

55:16.547 --> 55:17.014
we are--

55:17.047 --> 55:18.048
we came--

55:18.082 --> 55:18.783
George actually came in front.

55:18.816 --> 55:19.917
I'm Michael.

55:19.950 --> 55:20.818
I played your son
in the movie.

55:20.851 --> 55:21.419
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Hi.

55:21.452 --> 55:22.387
Hi.

55:22.420 --> 55:23.020
-Do you remember Michael?

55:23.053 --> 55:23.921
-Do you remember?

55:23.954 --> 55:24.555
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

55:24.589 --> 55:25.556
-Yeah.

55:25.590 --> 55:26.591
And I-- do you remember me?

55:26.624 --> 55:27.358
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I do.

55:27.392 --> 55:28.359
-How are you?

55:28.393 --> 55:28.893
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): I'm good.

55:28.926 --> 55:29.527
How are you?

55:29.560 --> 55:30.828
-Good.

55:30.861 --> 55:31.429
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): You
just came to say hi?

55:31.462 --> 55:31.862
-Yeah.

55:31.896 --> 55:32.830
We did.

55:32.863 --> 55:33.598
MARGO (OFFSCREEN): Crazy.

55:33.631 --> 55:34.465
-I don't know--

55:34.499 --> 55:34.899
I know, it is crazy.

55:34.932 --> 55:35.933
-We--

55:35.966 --> 55:37.034
I don't know if you've known--

55:37.067 --> 55:38.769
-We've been trying
to find you.

55:38.803 --> 55:39.537
You're the last one of all of
our cast members to find.

55:39.570 --> 55:40.505
We couldn't--

55:40.538 --> 55:41.406
of the major cast members.

55:41.439 --> 55:42.407
We couldn't find you.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.908
So now, are you working now?

55:43.941 --> 55:46.110
Or are you-- are you doing
auditions for anything now?

55:46.143 --> 55:47.512
Or--

55:47.545 --> 55:49.079
-Well, I haven't been
auditioning in

55:49.113 --> 55:51.982
the last, like, year.

55:52.016 --> 55:55.052
I don't really have an
agent right now.

55:55.085 --> 55:56.921
I did have one.

55:56.954 --> 55:59.089
You know, I'm just kind of
like edging into it.

55:59.123 --> 56:03.394
I'm waiting for things in my
life to kind of settle down a

56:03.428 --> 56:03.828
little bit.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.463
-Sure.

56:05.496 --> 56:10.435
-Because I just-- it's
complicated now for me to do

56:10.468 --> 56:10.968
things.

56:11.001 --> 56:11.869
-Sure, yeah.

56:11.902 --> 56:12.870
-It's just complicated.

56:12.903 --> 56:14.171
It's just complicated.

56:14.204 --> 56:17.007
I learn all the time new
things about acting.

56:17.041 --> 56:19.877
Even though I may not be acting
every single day or

56:19.910 --> 56:24.982
doing parts every single day,
I watch movies, and I take

56:25.015 --> 56:27.752
mental notes about what I
liked about what those

56:27.785 --> 56:29.420
characters are doing.

56:29.454 --> 56:31.055
And very often, I write it down
on a piece of paper and

56:31.088 --> 56:33.424
stick it on my mirror
in my bedroom.

56:33.458 --> 56:35.593
And then I look at it,
you know, until it

56:35.626 --> 56:36.927
sinks into my head.

56:36.961 --> 56:37.928
Hold on.

56:37.962 --> 56:38.896
Let me get a drink of water.

56:38.929 --> 56:39.864
Let me get you some water.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.165
There's some warm water.

56:41.198 --> 56:42.800
That will help you
out a little bit.

56:42.833 --> 56:44.735
OK.

56:44.769 --> 56:46.537
Taking care of my
mother is easy.

56:46.571 --> 56:47.872
She's easy.

56:47.905 --> 56:51.842
I feel sad for her having
to not be able to

56:51.876 --> 56:53.644
use one of her legs.

56:53.678 --> 56:55.880
I feel sad for her because she's
always been acting her

56:55.913 --> 56:56.881
whole entire life.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.683
You doing OK?

56:58.716 --> 57:00.451
We're going to have dinner
pretty soon.

57:00.485 --> 57:01.919
They're almost done.

57:01.952 --> 57:04.154
This has lasted quite a lot
longer than I thought.

57:04.188 --> 57:04.989
-Yes.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.491
-Yeah.

57:06.524 --> 57:07.858
But we're going to have
dinner pretty soon.

57:07.892 --> 57:08.893
And then we'll-- we'll get
ready to go to bed.

57:17.635 --> 57:22.039
I just made it me.

57:22.072 --> 57:28.846
I just did it the way I would
do it because I felt that we

57:28.879 --> 57:31.516
were just like one
person, you know?

57:31.549 --> 57:34.485
And I could just take the words
and let them come out of

57:34.519 --> 57:36.887
my mouth just the way
I would do it.

57:36.921 --> 57:39.790
And so it became a really
simple thing.

57:39.824 --> 57:41.859
-Joshua, start singing.

57:41.892 --> 57:42.893
Come on.

57:42.927 --> 57:44.028
Sing that song I like so much.

57:44.061 --> 57:46.230
-I don't feel like
singing, mom.

57:46.263 --> 57:48.198
-Just sing.

57:48.232 --> 57:52.002
-(SINGING) Row, row, row your
boat, gently down the stream.

57:52.036 --> 57:53.871
-(SINGING) Merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily,

57:53.904 --> 57:55.606
life is but a dream.

57:55.640 --> 58:00.244
-I remember you crying out in
that voice that just sent

58:00.277 --> 58:02.513
shudders through my spine.

58:02.547 --> 58:06.116
(WHISPERING) Mom, mom.

58:06.150 --> 58:08.085
-They're eating my mom.

58:16.827 --> 58:20.097
-And I really believed that
you had lost your mother.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.071
It was great.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.109
I don't really feel sad that
I never had children.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.611
It's not that I don't
like children.

58:33.644 --> 58:35.179
I like children.

58:35.212 --> 58:40.117
But I really don't think that
I could be a real life mom.

58:40.150 --> 58:43.921
Joshua, sing that song
I like so much.

58:43.954 --> 58:46.123
-But mom, I don't feel
like singing.

58:46.156 --> 58:49.159
-Come on, sing.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.962
-(SINGING) Row, row, row
your boat, gently--

58:51.996 --> 58:53.864
[laughing]

58:53.898 --> 58:56.901
-Why can't-- are you laughing
at my voice?

58:56.934 --> 58:58.836
-No, I'm laughing
at me because--

58:58.869 --> 58:59.837
[laughing]

58:59.870 --> 59:01.271
-I know.

59:01.305 --> 59:05.175
That's what the choir
instructor did.

59:05.209 --> 59:07.344
-I just never imagined
we'd be doing this.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.245
OK.

59:08.278 --> 59:09.714
You ready?

59:09.747 --> 59:11.081
Let's do it again.

59:11.115 --> 59:12.617
[SINGING IN ROUNDS - "ROW,
ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT"]

59:22.693 --> 59:25.663
-After I watched the movie, and
I saw it, and it was over,

59:25.696 --> 59:27.331
and I turned off the TV,
I just sat back.

59:27.364 --> 59:29.834
And I said, wow,
this is great.

59:29.867 --> 59:30.901
This is really great.

59:30.935 --> 59:32.336
It was really good.

59:32.369 --> 59:38.208
It's a simple, elegant, down
to earth, real, natural,

59:38.242 --> 59:39.944
actor, actor movie.

59:39.977 --> 59:43.313
You know, most of the movies
that are around now are fast

59:43.347 --> 59:47.652
paced and car chases and car
crashes and explosions and

59:47.685 --> 59:51.789
fires and murders and blood
and gore and killing.

59:51.822 --> 59:55.025
But you compare our movie to a
Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey

59:55.059 --> 01:00:01.766
Bogart movie, and it fits in
because our movie was all

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:05.670
about people and the experiences
those people were

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:10.107
experiencing, just as
"Casablanca" and those movies

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.043
are about people and the
experiences they're

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.845
experiencing.

01:00:14.879 --> 01:00:15.980
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Well,
I was ready to go.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:17.247
I was ready to get
the heck out.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.717
And so I kept putting
my jacket on.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:22.019
And the old grandmother goes,
(RASPY VOICE) it ain't going

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.754
to do you any good to
put the jacket on.

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:25.155
That ain't going to make
them leave any earlier.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:30.828
It was just a strange day.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:32.429
So I don't want to
ever do it again.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:49.714
Hey, how you doing?

01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:50.147
-Fine.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:50.915
-Good.

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:51.682
I'm Dr. Hardy.

01:00:51.716 --> 01:00:52.850
How you been?

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:53.450
You don't know who I--

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:54.318
-Oh, yeah.

01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:55.052
You're the troll.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:55.786
-That's right.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.687
You know it.

01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:57.454
Have you seen the movie?

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:58.322
-No.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:58.956
-You hadn't seen it?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.090
-Mm-mm.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:00.725
-Well, you need to
come tomorrow.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:01.291
I mean--

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:01.926
-Probably will.

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:02.827
-Sunday.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.694
Have you heard about it?

01:01:03.728 --> 01:01:04.729
-I read it in the paper.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:05.696
-Did you read it in the paper?

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.296
You think you might come?

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.131
-Yeah, I might.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.332
-Oh, great.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:09.934
Well, this is a little
flyer about it.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:10.701
We're going around the
neighborhood, just telling

01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:12.236
folks about it.

01:01:12.269 --> 01:01:13.971
-I was talking to George's
sister Mollie, who teaches in

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:15.439
our school system, and I said,
you know, with all of this

01:01:15.472 --> 01:01:19.243
hype about "Troll 2," why in the
world don't we try to do

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:22.112
something here as a fundraiser
for the school?

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:25.249
And of course, George being the
put the cameras on me sort

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:27.785
of fella, you know, the
thoughts of that--

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:31.956
he jumped on that
and ran with it.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:33.323
-They're going to come.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:34.925
I know they're going to come.

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.260
These folks will see that,
and there's no question.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.832
How many does that seat
again in there?

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:42.499
-260.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.400
-260?

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.002
Oh, great.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.136
Did you say you're getting
some people interested?

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:46.937
-Yeah, some.

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:48.038
I guess you--

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:48.839
you told some people.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.307
-Oh, I have, yeah.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.242
We're putting out flyers because
I was in a movie back

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:54.945
in 1990-- oh, that's
your address.

01:01:54.979 --> 01:01:57.114
It's the worst film ever
made of all time.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.383
-All right, then.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:02.186
-But this is a movie that I
was in back in the '90s.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:02.820
-Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:03.988
-Yeah.

01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:04.989
-You want me to hang
this up for you?

01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:05.990
-Yeah, would you hang it up?

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:07.391
-I don't mind.

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:09.193
-Now you had told me that
it had a pretty big cult

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:09.827
following.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.928
-Huge.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:11.796
-Out, you know.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.297
-All over the world.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:15.299
We've got fans in England,
Iceland.

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:18.769
Honestly, I'm like a cult
luminary when I go to these

01:02:18.803 --> 01:02:19.804
screenings.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:20.805
It's just hilarious, Barbara.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:21.939
I would never have dreamed.

01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:23.173
But it's been a lot--

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:25.109
-George has told me that
it has spread.

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:28.112
The interest has spread
or cult, I guess

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:29.279
you would call it.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:30.781
Yeah, I teach Sunday
school class.

01:02:30.815 --> 01:02:32.182
I got about 50 in my Sunday
school class.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:35.485
So Sunday morning, I'm
going to issue an

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:37.421
invitation for all of them.

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:41.491
-Lily, can you put some of
these up at the school?

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:44.528
-These are?

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:46.396
-You don't want to?

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:47.965
You see that poster
right there?

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:48.498
-Uh-huh.

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:49.099
-"Troll 2."

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:50.234
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:50.868
-Do you know anything
about it?

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:51.401
-Mm-mm.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:52.169
-You don't?

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:53.971
Are you serious?

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:54.972
Oh, my gosh.

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:55.940
-It's a movie or something?

01:02:55.973 --> 01:02:56.340
-Yeah, it's a movie.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:57.307
OK.

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:58.909
Well, I was in that movie.

01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.145
-I thought I remembered seeing
that in the paper.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:02.312
-Right, right, right, right.

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:03.147
-Yeah, mm-hmm.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:03.981
-I must do it.

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:04.882
I must do it.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:05.582
I must do it.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.316
And he goes, [groans]

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.918
like that.

01:03:07.952 --> 01:03:09.286
And he-- and he's going to
pee all over the table.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:12.022
So then the next scene is
just me going upstairs.

01:03:12.056 --> 01:03:13.557
And I go, you can't piss
on hospitality!

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:16.894
I won't allow it!

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:19.463
And I was, you know,
doing that too.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:20.998
It's a crazy, movie.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:22.199
-It sounds like it's
a good movie.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:24.134
-You need to come
see this thing.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.235
-I'm going to try, I promise.

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:26.603
-You got any plans Sunday?

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.105
-No, just going to church.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.373
-Well, good.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.274
That'd be a great, fun
thing to do after

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:31.942
church, come see this.

01:03:31.976 --> 01:03:33.210
But anyway, we'll go over your
treatment plan in just a

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:33.610
second.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.211
-OK.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:35.379
OK.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.981
-I think George was
born an actor.

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:41.251
I think dentistry is just
a stage he's on.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.053
I really do.

01:03:43.087 --> 01:03:46.123
I think he missed his calling
when this was not his lifelong

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.557
profession.

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:51.528
I mean, anybody who's known
George early on, teenage

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.497
years, college years--

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.867
everything he's done has been
something that could have led

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.435
him to this.

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.404
Being a cheerleader at Austin,
he was in front of thousands

01:04:00.437 --> 01:04:01.371
and thousands of people
at a time.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:03.240
He was just a natural.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:04.574
-George always wanted
to be a movie star.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:06.343
I think that was what
was in his heart.

01:04:06.376 --> 01:04:07.912
He was always an entertainer.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:10.580
He was, um--

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:12.082
he was--

01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:13.250
always liked to be in
the limelight and be

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:14.651
in the middle of--

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.987
the center of attention of
anything that he did.

01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:19.890
-I was in a movie
back in 1989.

01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:23.560
It's called "Troll 2," and it's
become known as the worst

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.095
movie of all time.

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:25.529
-Really?

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:26.163
-Yeah.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.297
-Hmm.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:28.432
-So you're in for
a treat today.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:29.967
Ain't she, Rachael?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.368
-Yeah.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:34.138
Can't wait to hear what you
have to say about this.

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:36.373
-What'll happen is you'll
just let your head up.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:40.177
And this is just going to go
around your hair in the back.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.078
-OK.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.246
-And I just put it on.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:43.413
And you should be able
to look out.

01:04:43.447 --> 01:04:44.381
-OK.

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:47.952
-So it's pretty cool.

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:51.288
Now, if you want to stop
me and ask me any

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:52.522
questions, just stop.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.258
Raise your hand and
stop and ask, OK?

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.293
-I would hate to be in his
dental chair right now because

01:04:56.326 --> 01:05:00.297
I know his focus is not on what
he's doing in terms of

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:01.999
dental work.

01:05:02.032 --> 01:05:03.934
It's getting ready for this
weekend and the "Troll 2"

01:05:03.968 --> 01:05:05.369
premier in Alex City.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.337
-You know that movie, "Troll
2," Dr. Hardy was in?

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:09.273
MALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE):
I just read about it.

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:10.640
-Did you read the paper
this morning?

01:05:10.674 --> 01:05:11.675
MALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Mm-hmm.

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:14.178
At 5:00 on Sunday afternoon?

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:15.379
-Yeah, at Playhouse Cinemas.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.446
Are you going to come?

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.647
MALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Uh-huh.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.549
-Hey, um, we were calling
because--

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.585
you know George was in that
movie, "Troll 2?"

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:22.552
MALE SPEAKER (ON
PHONE): Mm-hmm.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:23.553
-Have you heard?

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:24.688
They're having like a--

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:25.455
FEMALE SPEAKER (OH
PHONE): Hello?

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:26.590
-Mrs. Roxanna.

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:27.457
FEMALE SPEAKER (OH
PHONE): Mm-hmm.

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.093
-Hey, this is Micki.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.227
Dr. Hardy-- you know he was
in the movie "Troll 2?"

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.228
FEMALE SPEAKER (OH
PHONE): [laughs]

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.097
Yeah.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.399
-We're earning our
money today.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:38.302
-We're showing it this Sunday
in Alex City because we've

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:40.104
shown it on different
screenings all

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:41.638
over the United States.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.108
I don't tell too many people
about them-- about it.

01:05:44.141 --> 01:05:46.443
Because it's the worst film
ever made of all time.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:48.245
So--

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:51.148
anyway, today, we'll get started
with you in just a few

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:51.548
minutes.

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:52.282
-OK.

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:52.682
-All right.

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:54.084
Good.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.388
Thank you for coming to this.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:05:59.623
-I'm so excited.

01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:01.058
Hi.

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:02.459
-You're all going to
enjoy this thing.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:03.460
Thanks for coming.

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:04.494
I know.

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:05.762
-You're the star of the movie.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.431
-Thank you.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.466
I was concerned that not very
many people were coming.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.568
I kept trying to tell myself,
don't have any

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.303
expectations around it.

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:15.639
But then when more and more
people showed up, it made me

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:18.375
feel a lot better.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.376
-Get your t-shirts!

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:20.377
Get your t-shirts!

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.778
Get your t-shirts!

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:27.384
Dr. George Hardy right
here on a t-shirt.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:30.387
-This crowd was much more
serious watching the film.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.621
We were cracking up.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.090
But then behind us,
I mean, there was

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:34.291
just like Dr. Vasdela.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.559
She was just like--

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:37.227
she was really trying to
figure it all out.

01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:38.695
Everybody--

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.364
they know what's about to come,
and they all laugh at

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:41.531
everything beforehand.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:42.566
-Right.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:44.268
-But here, it's just serious.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.302
It's like everybody--

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:46.503
-Well, the hometown reaction.

01:06:46.536 --> 01:06:48.138
They're just-- they want
to just focus.

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:49.673
Every--

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:51.641
every second that you're in the
movie, they're just trying

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:53.043
to take it all in.

01:06:53.077 --> 01:06:54.744
And it's the first time
most of these

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.380
people have seen this.

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:57.147
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Thank you for coming.

01:06:57.181 --> 01:06:59.749
Thanks a lot.

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.518
-There were a lot of
patients here.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:03.120
There were a lot that came.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:06.356
And I think we'll have
definitely a lot of people

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:09.293
calling us to find out how
he feels, if he's back to

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.494
dentistry or acting.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.301
-So, you know, you're the
Patch Adams of dentistry

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:17.834
around here.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.136
-Maybe so, yeah.

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.604
-No, you are.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.738
-But--

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.373
-You just make people
feel better.

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:25.542
-But do you miss that, you know,
the feeling you got,

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:28.612
going into that audition and
then getting the part, you

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:31.181
know, that creative outlet?

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:31.715
-Yeah.

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:33.417
-OK.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:35.652
You're established
in your career.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:37.087
You've been-- you've
been established.

01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:37.721
-Yeah.

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:39.256
Yeah, that's fine.

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:40.157
-So but would you ever entertain
the thought of--

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.857
-Oh, well, yeah.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.092
It's a great thing.

01:07:42.126 --> 01:07:44.161
I mean, you know, a lot to me.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:45.362
It's great.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.563
This is a very stable
situation for

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:47.464
me to be doing this.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.133
And it's a nice income.

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.634
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): What does
your heart say, George?

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:51.601
-Thank you.

01:07:51.635 --> 01:07:55.272
-Don't tell me the PR end.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:57.874
-If I-- if I could--
it would be awfully

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.209
hard to leave my dentistry.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:07:59.809
It would really be hard.

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:01.211
-I know it would.

01:08:01.245 --> 01:08:02.346
And you care about your
staff and your

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:03.147
patients and your family.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.481
-Well, it-- it--

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:05.882
it sets up a great
lifestyle for me.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.652
But I really wanted to be
an actor from the start.

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:10.254
And I just felt like
it would--

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:12.189
I felt like I would be fun
in front of the camera.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:16.292
And I just felt I had
a presence that--

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.595
that I could-- could make
in front of the camera.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.197
But I just--

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.698
I was too scared to do it
because I'm in a small

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:22.866
Southern town.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.834
And my dad kept telling
me, no, son.

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:26.170
You-- that's too risky.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.671
You can't do that
kind of thing.

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:31.475
It was a forced thing for me
to-- to become a dentist.

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:33.676
And I'd hundreds of thousands
of dollars becoming a

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.279
dentist, you know.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:38.381
And it wasn't practical to
do something like that.

01:08:38.415 --> 01:08:41.350
I really kind of wanted to have
another shot at acting or

01:08:41.385 --> 01:08:42.519
do another--

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.720
I really think I could
have done--

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.756
done more.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:50.727
-To be an actor, you've
got to be half crazy.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.798
If you're not willing to head
for New York or LA and try

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:58.768
there, you're never going
to make any money at it.

01:09:04.207 --> 01:09:06.876
But I don't want to live
in LA or New York.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:09.313
I don't like the big cities.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:14.718
I'd like to be able to make a
living doing acting just in a

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:17.220
smaller town.

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:19.356
And that's just almost
impossible.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:27.397
I, uh, started playing old
men right off the bat.

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:30.634
I played Firs in "Cherry
Orchard." I played Old Ekdal

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:34.337
in "The Wild Duck." I--

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:38.608
I probably have done
several 100 plays.

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:43.647
This one here is a picture of
the young me when I was a

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.316
freshman in college.

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:49.953
I didn't have a beard then.

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:54.324
I used to have hair on
top of my head too.

01:09:54.358 --> 01:09:56.593
No children, no--

01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:59.396
no grandchildren, no great
grandchildren or

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:00.597
anything like that.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:06.703
Mostly, I've wasted my life.

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:08.305
I--

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.639
I always thought I had kind
of potential, but I

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.941
never did use it.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:13.743
Don't know.

01:10:13.777 --> 01:10:17.314
More or less, I have frittered
my life what else is there to

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:18.982
do with a life but
fritter it away?

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:26.022
-The memorabilia thing
is supposed to be

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.757
a pretty big deal.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:29.493
The guy from "Heroes" is going
to be there and then John

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:32.296
Schneider from "The Dukes of
Hazzard." And then a lot of

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:35.465
old "Star Wars" memorabilia
will be out.

01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:38.968
I'm glad Claudio's not with us
this trip, actually, just

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:46.610
because, uh, um--

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.878
because I really want the
limelight, and Claudio always

01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.280
gets the limelight.

01:11:07.431 --> 01:11:10.534
For those of you that have not
seen this movie, they call

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:13.470
this the Myspace generation's
"Rocky Horror Picture Show."

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:16.840
So like "Rocky Horror," the
musical, that's just so bad

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:20.477
it's good, there are lines in
the movie that we had to say,

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:22.312
you just kind of go, where
did that come from?

01:11:22.346 --> 01:11:23.580
Was that really--

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.881
what was that all about?

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.683
Did that really happen?

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:28.352
So, um, that's been one of the
funnest parts about this film

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:30.487
for everyone.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.792
-Has anyone got any questions,
any more questions?

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.461
-It was a disaster.

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.396
I was sure there was going to
be "Troll 2" fans there

01:11:39.429 --> 01:11:41.931
everywhere, lined up, you know,
and they're going to be

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:43.867
lined up for sure, you know,
like they are at the

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.369
screenings.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:46.836
And they're going to all
want our autograph.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.672
Have you ever seen "Troll 2?"
Aw, you're missing it.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.678
It was the worst film ever made,
worse than any of these

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:57.914
films ever made here.

01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:01.751
Have you seen "Troll 2?" Do you
like really bad movies?

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:02.386
Yes?

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:03.487
-Yeah.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:03.987
-Well, that's what
this one is.

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.622
-Oh, wow.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.457
-It was rated on IMDb as the
worst film that's ever--

01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:08.892
of all time.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.528
"Troll 2." I go, you can't
piss on hospitality!

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:12.462
I won't allow it!

01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:14.398
I said, you know--

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.566
-I'll have to look
out for that.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.869
-And when I yell at him like
that, then that becomes a

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:21.671
famous line in the movie.

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:25.509
We've had about between 15 to
20 screenings in the States,

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:26.476
and they've sold out.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.910
-Yeah?

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.378
-Yeah.

01:12:28.412 --> 01:12:30.614
-You reckon out here,
you did the same?

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:31.781
-I'm sorry?

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:34.150
-Would you reckon that
[inaudible]?

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.653
-Come again?

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:37.854
Who wants my autograph?

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:42.058
Does anybody want
my autograph?

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.698
No one's freaking
going to come.

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:52.669
We've come 15,000 miles,
and nobody's going to

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:53.770
come to this table.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:54.704
You got to laugh.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:55.905
Come on.

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:00.710
You all need to see our
movie that I was in.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:02.712
I was in a film.

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:04.414
I was in a film called
"Troll 2."

01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:05.982
-OK

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.618
-So he's heard of "Troll 2."
He's knows about "Troll 2."

01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:10.954
-Absolutely, no, I love
"Troll 2." I love it.

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:12.088
Why not?

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:13.923
-This young man's
name is James.

01:13:13.957 --> 01:13:15.425
-James All right.

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.971
-What I took away from that is,
I mean, you know, "Troll

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:31.775
2" only attracts just that
special group of people that,

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:33.910
you know, know about
the movie.

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:36.713
Same thing, same thing with
the horror conventions.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.914
It's a different audience.

01:13:54.698 --> 01:13:58.635
Well, this is very
interesting.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:01.638
This is very interesting.

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:04.874
I've never seen anything
like this before.

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:06.810
-Horror fans are unbelievable.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:08.512
They're so loyal.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:11.781
And they carry the torch for
years and years and years.

01:14:11.815 --> 01:14:13.149
-Yeah, I wonder why
people like that.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.117
I don't--

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:14.851
I don't like horror films.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:16.119
-You don't?

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.587
-I mean, it's not that
I don't like them.

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:19.188
I just don't watch too
many horror films.

01:14:19.222 --> 01:14:20.657
But I've started watching them
a little bit more since I was

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:21.525
in this film.

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:22.191
-Yeah, I love them.

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:23.026
I love them.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.227
-It's intriguing.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.495
And so, Erika, you were
in the movie--

01:14:25.529 --> 01:14:26.162
-"Nightmare on

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.765
Elm Street 5." -OK.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.835
I've just been talking to all
the, uh, celebrities from

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:38.241
"Nightmare on the Elm Street"
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:40.009
-Were you in "Troll
1" as well?

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:42.111
-No, "Troll 1" and "Troll 2"
don't have anything to do with

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:43.079
each other at all.

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:44.581
-Oh, that's interesting.

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:46.215
Have you ever watched
"Troll 2?"

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:47.083
-Have you seen "Troll 2?"

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.618
-Have you seen it?

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:49.519
-No.

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:50.754
-Oh, you are missing it.

01:14:50.787 --> 01:14:52.121
You are totally missing it.

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:53.222
Have you ever seen "Night--

01:14:53.256 --> 01:14:56.593
Nightmare on Elm Street
3--" Five.

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:57.527
-Four.

01:14:57.561 --> 01:14:58.828
-Four, four.

01:14:58.862 --> 01:14:59.796
-Four.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.930
I believe I have.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:02.999
-Oh, you guys really
are famous.

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:07.270
It's interesting because a lot
of the actors from the movie

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:10.974
have never done anything after
"Nightmare on Elm Street,"

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.275
just like me.

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:14.043
You know, they've not
done anything else.

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:16.746
I was intrigued by a lot of
these people that were signing

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.248
autographs from something they'd
done 20 years back.

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:20.950
Yeah, it's fun to do.

01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:22.619
But it's like--

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:25.021
it seemed like their whole life
was around what they did

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.723
20, 30 years back.

01:15:26.756 --> 01:15:29.626
And so I thought, god,
don't you have

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:30.960
something better to do?

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:31.861
Then I turned around and
thought, don't I have

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:32.962
something better to do?

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:38.001
Whew.

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:42.706
I do not see how people
like that stuff.

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:44.107
God, almighty, no.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.743
This place gives
me the creeps.

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:48.244
I think I'm about to get sick.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:51.180
I mean, why do people
like this shit?

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:52.916
Ugh.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.784
When you walk around this
place, you kind of get a

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:56.820
little bit nauseated.

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:58.354
Like, I've gone to
the bathroom.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.725
Honestly, I've washed my hands
about four or five times.

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:02.892
God, I feel dirty
or something.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.330
I was--

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.666
I was, uh--

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:12.135
met a director of--

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:13.269
big director back there.

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.038
It's just amazing.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:18.141
He's, like, got a huge film
coming out this Friday, like a

01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:19.809
big budget film.

01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:20.644
And it's--

01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:21.778
-Is it "Doomsday?"

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:22.679
-Yeah, "Doomsday"
is coming out.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:23.379
-Yeah, Neil Marshall.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.280
-Yeah, Neil Marshall.

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.749
I was talking to him.

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:28.752
It's just-- it's just
amazing how the--

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:31.220
you just can't make conversation
with--

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:32.822
we were just sitting right
there at the table.

01:16:32.856 --> 01:16:36.059
And you can't make conversation
much with people

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.194
that are at that
level, I guess.

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.296
I mean, he must have a lot of
things on his mind all the

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.898
time, you know.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:44.067
But then so do I. I've got
teeth to think about.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:44.834
You know what I mean?

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:46.402
-Yeah, totally.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.205
-I mean, that's more important
than some computer graphics

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:53.076
guy morphing a movie,
don't you think?

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:57.647
For $30,000 million?

01:16:57.681 --> 01:16:59.215
And there's plenty of gingivitis
around here too.

01:16:59.248 --> 01:17:00.116
Have you noticed that?

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:01.985
Tons of gingivitis.

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:03.286
DARREN (OFFSCREEN): Is there?

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:04.253
I never notice that.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.022
-It's really bad.

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:09.192
I guarantee you only about 5%
of these people floss their

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.694
teeth on a daily basis.

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:15.832
Oh, my god.

01:17:15.865 --> 01:17:16.800
This--

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.802
these folks are weird.

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:21.304
I mean, this is not Halloween.

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:22.305
What's they day today?

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:23.306
March 9th?

01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:24.774
-March, yeah.

01:17:24.808 --> 01:17:25.675
-Freaking weird.

01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:27.143
These folks are just--

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:30.079
they've lost it.

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:31.948
I'm just sick of this place.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:32.916
Let's get out of here.

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:34.818
Let's flip this joint.

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:35.852
You want to?

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:36.920
-Yeah, let's get out of here.

01:17:36.953 --> 01:17:37.821
-Let's get out of here.

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:38.454
Let's just clean it up.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.455
I am sick of this.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.090
I will never do this again.

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:43.893
I think I was pretty much burned
out on "Troll 2" stuff.

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:46.195
It was fun and something
I did, you know.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.264
But I wouldn't want
to do this again.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:52.168
You know, it gets old after
saying the piss on hospitality

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.838
scene over and over again.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:57.440
I can't imagine what it must
be like for Celine Dion to

01:17:57.473 --> 01:18:00.043
sing, uh, the "Titanic" song.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:00.476
You know?

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:01.978
I mean--

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.246
I mean, she's probably
sung it 5,000 times.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.413
And to sing it again?

01:18:04.447 --> 01:18:07.016
You know, how do you
keep doing that?

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:08.217
Poor Celine.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:20.797
TIM (OFFSCREEN): We started
the Rolling Roadshow about

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.766
seven years ago.

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:26.435
It came about as an offshoot
of what we do at the Alamo

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:28.171
Drafthouse.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.506
We've always done a lot of
themed events at the theater.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:34.844
And we thought, well, one of the
best ways that we can have

01:18:34.878 --> 01:18:38.414
the ultimate movie experience
is to have super fans in a

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.884
place that's almost like a
trip to Mecca for them.

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:44.153
So we started doing nationwide
tours and doing famous in

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:45.922
famous locations.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.992
And when we got involved with
"Troll 2," I don't know when

01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:51.327
the idea came about or how
the idea came about.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.997
But it just seemed like, yeah,
that's really something that's

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:55.799
got to be done.

01:18:55.832 --> 01:18:58.067
-I guess famous movies and
famous locations doesn't

01:18:58.101 --> 01:19:01.037
really apply to this screening
either way.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.338
TIM (OFFSCREEN): No, it's a not
so famous movie in a not

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:04.073
so famous location.

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:06.475
But it's famous in the minds of
the people that are going

01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:07.877
to come here.

01:19:19.255 --> 01:19:23.159
-The whole time, I just kept,
in my head, just thinking, I

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:27.263
feel like that if I came and
witnessed first hand, it would

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.798
dawn on me, oh.

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:30.133
It's just like--

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:32.035
it's so intriguing to people.

01:19:32.068 --> 01:19:33.436
But I couldn't figure it out.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:35.071
I still can't figure it out.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:39.008
With everyone I signed, I wanted
to go, are you sure?

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:40.009
-Oh, god.

01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:41.010
That's great.

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:43.980
Oh, god.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:47.951
-I don't know if I have a better
memory of fandom than

01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:48.852
this event.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:51.320
This was pretty strong.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:54.323
-Where is Margo Prey?

01:19:54.357 --> 01:19:55.291
We love her.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:56.926
We miss her.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.063
-A lot of the cast members
will be here tomorrow.

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:04.467
I think just about everybody,
except for Margo.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.970
Yeah.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.504
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN):
Is it impossible?

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:10.439
Is it impossible to get you to
this screening, completely

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:11.074
impossible?

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:11.507
-It is.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.208
It is.

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:13.109
-Oh, man.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:13.542
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:15.311
-It is.

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:16.512
-I think you're the only cast
member that won't be there.

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.081
-Who's not going to be there?

01:20:18.114 --> 01:20:19.215
-I know you want to come.

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:19.983
-I do.

01:20:20.016 --> 01:20:20.549
-I can feel it.

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.450
I can feel it.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:22.618
-I just know that I--

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.087
I just know that it's
complicated.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.621
It's just complicated.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.256
And I'd be afraid, and
I'd be nervous.

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:28.958
And I wouldn't know
what to do.

01:20:28.992 --> 01:20:31.160
-I mean, if you could have
anything to remedy this whole

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:32.561
solution, what would it be?

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:35.131
-To go away somewhere where
no one can find me.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.100
-Really?

01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:42.105
That's the-- that's the
solution to it all?

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:46.175
-And up somewhere, anywhere, I
don't care where, in another

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:48.611
house, in another place, in
a normal neighborhood with

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:50.013
normal people.

01:20:52.248 --> 01:20:54.183
So they make noise
all night long.

01:20:54.217 --> 01:20:56.119
And the noise is so intense
that sometimes

01:20:56.152 --> 01:20:57.386
it makes you dizzy.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.421
-What is the sound like?

01:20:58.454 --> 01:20:59.388
What kind of noise is it?

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:01.190
-[high pitched scream]

01:21:04.393 --> 01:21:06.362
-That is--

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:08.898
GEORGE (OFFSCREEN): Wow.

01:21:08.932 --> 01:21:11.300
MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:12.168
-Okey-doke.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.036
-Take care.

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:13.569
You're a sweetheart.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:14.203
-Thank you.

01:21:14.237 --> 01:21:14.904
-Bye-bye

01:21:14.938 --> 01:21:15.338
-Bye-bye.

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:16.039
-Bye.

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:17.506
-Bye-bye.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.342
-But I was hoping, starting over
there with you guys, we

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.210
could just go through, and
if you gave us one or two

01:21:21.244 --> 01:21:24.313
adjectives that describe the
way you felt when you first

01:21:24.347 --> 01:21:28.017
saw "Troll 2" after
being in it.

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:33.990
-Um, well, I saw it actually,
right when it was first

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:35.591
released on HBO.

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.360
And I think I tuned
in maybe halfway

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.195
through that first time.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:42.598
Um, I was confused.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.067
And then I was depressed.

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:49.973
-The actors--

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:51.707
every time, the same.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.578
-We thought we were all making
a bona fide horror film.

01:21:55.611 --> 01:22:00.416
And unfortunately, when none
of us got scripts, full

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:02.085
scripts-- so we didn't
really know--

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:03.686
-You are wrong!

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:06.589
You are completely wrong.

01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:10.126
-Or at least, nobody in our
group got full scripts.

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:13.963
So we didn't know exactly what
the flow of the story was

01:22:13.997 --> 01:22:15.464
going to be or what our parts
were going to be.

01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:42.591
-Actually, in the script, I was
turned into a plant and

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.327
put into a plot.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.063
And Darren and I were right next
to each other, and we had

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.665
dialog all the way
through the end.

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:50.566
-You don't remember.

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:52.235
-But they cut it out.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:53.702
And then when I was done
filming, I was like, what the

01:22:53.736 --> 01:22:56.205
hell happened to, like, the end,
my scenes and all that?

01:22:56.239 --> 01:22:57.406
And so I didn't know
what happened to me

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.441
till I watched it.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:22:59.642
And I really still don't know.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:00.776
-Well, you don't remember
anything.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.677
-Yes, we do.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.345
The whole time, we do.

01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:03.246
-No.

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:04.213
-OK.

01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:06.149
-OK, now it's my time to--

01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:07.350
to say to you.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.063
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): So
are there any outtakes from

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:30.139
"Troll 2?"

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:40.149
"Troll 2?"

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:10.079
JESSE (OFFSCREEN): Claudio's
made so many movies.

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:13.249
I want to know what he thinks
about his career because, you

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:15.684
know, John Ford was pumping
out like three

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:17.286
films a year for years.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.688
And he never gave a shit
about his movies.

01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:21.157
He just was a filmmaker.

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:22.491
That's just what he did.

01:24:22.525 --> 01:24:26.262
-I never see the movie
with the print, the

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:28.264
real print, you know?

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:30.666
That's wonderful for me.

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:37.606
I want to understand what kind
of movie I did 18 years ago.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:39.575
Now maybe I can understand.

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:36.899
-I hope that he understands,
you know, how

01:25:36.932 --> 01:25:38.501
wonderful "Troll 2" was.

01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:40.503
I don't even want to
call it a bad film.

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.405
Like, it's an amazing film.

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:44.873
-It's not a matter of the
production value or

01:25:44.907 --> 01:25:47.943
the budget or talent.

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:50.879
It's just whether or not
something entertains.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:54.450
-A film like this maybe happens
once a generation.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.885
-It's a real magic formula.

01:25:56.919 --> 01:25:58.554
The stars aligned.

01:25:58.587 --> 01:26:00.889
-How do you make a movie
like "Troll 2" then?

01:26:00.923 --> 01:26:03.859
-You can't set out to make
a film like this.

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:08.797
The gods of filmmaking were
looking down on you.

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.633
-This is our 20th-something--

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.301
20-something-th screening.

01:26:12.335 --> 01:26:13.736
I--

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:16.872
I was tired of seeing "Troll
2" for the 20th time.

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.274
Three.

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.346
Maybe a little few
egg whites too.

01:26:23.379 --> 01:26:25.814
That would be good.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:27.216
Egg whites are terrific.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:31.954
Half a banana so that
the glycemic

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:33.356
index is nice and high.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:48.404
Today, I have a great life
here in Alabama, a really

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:48.837
great life.

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:50.005
Yeah.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:50.973
It's just home.

01:26:51.006 --> 01:26:53.609
Alabama's just home.

01:26:53.642 --> 01:26:54.943
I love Lake Martin.

01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:57.313
I mean, it's the jewel
of the Southeast.

01:26:57.346 --> 01:26:59.482
And I have a good dental
practice, a

01:26:59.515 --> 01:27:02.885
strong, solid practice.

01:27:02.918 --> 01:27:05.321
I've got great relationships
with my patients.

01:27:07.923 --> 01:27:10.659
And I have four beautiful
women that work with me.

01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:18.734
I have a great relationship with
my family, my mom and dad

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:20.736
are still living, which
is really--

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:23.339
I'm very, very thankful
for that.

01:27:23.372 --> 01:27:26.342
I love my daughters, and I have
a good relationship with

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:27.510
my ex-wife.

01:27:27.543 --> 01:27:30.313
And I have a lot of
good friends.

01:27:30.346 --> 01:27:31.747
I guess at this point,
I kind of like

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:33.316
keeping my life simple.

01:27:33.349 --> 01:27:34.517
And the simpler, the better.

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:44.527
I'm very fortunate to be a part
of a good story here in

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.728
Alexander City.

MICHAEL (OFFSCREEN): Would
you star in "Troll 3" if

01:28:05.448 --> 01:28:06.615
Claudio asked you?

01:28:06.649 --> 01:28:08.517
-Yes.

01:28:08.551 --> 01:28:13.889
I would star in "Troll 3." I'd
love to star in "Troll 3."

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:14.723
What are you guys
talking about?

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:15.924
Of course.
