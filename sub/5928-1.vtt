03:43.232 --> 03:44.358
Rockin'.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.780
Trick or treat!

03:50.781 --> 03:52.448
You're just disgusting.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.699
And turn that noise down!

03:53.700 --> 03:55.873
Don't you dare, bitch,
get off that!

03:56.787 --> 03:58.704
- Hey, Stooge.
- What?

03:58.705 --> 04:00.207
Check out the old fart.

04:00.208 --> 04:02.083
All right, dude!

04:02.084 --> 04:04.633
Stooge is hellin' him.
Make yourself useful, okay?

04:04.634 --> 04:06.551
Take the wheel.
Ahh!

04:12.427 --> 04:14.850
Hey, Grandpa, look in the mirror!

04:16.932 --> 04:18.558
You stupid bastards!

04:18.559 --> 04:20.101
Damn you all to hell!

04:20.101 --> 04:25.273
Happy Halloween, asshole.

04:25.274 --> 04:27.117
Damn kids.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.596
There's no fool like an old fool.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.809
You son of a bitch!

04:54.810 --> 04:56.098
Hey, hey, cool it, pops.

04:56.099 --> 04:57.859
You want to blow your
pacemaker or somethin'?

05:14.489 --> 05:16.535
Gee, mister, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

05:16.536 --> 05:17.999
Get your hands off of me!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.119
- Hey, calm down.
- Get away from me!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.745
I... I was just trying to help.

05:21.746 --> 05:24.216
I don't need your help,
you damn little whore!

05:25.208 --> 05:29.133
Well fine, I wouldn't want to help
an old creep like you anyway.

05:30.213 --> 05:31.965
Damn rotten kids.

05:34.926 --> 05:36.928
They'll get what they deserve.

05:36.929 --> 05:42.435
Yes, they'll get what
they deserve tonight.

05:47.773 --> 05:50.358
- Judy.
- Sorry, Mom, I'm in a hurry.

05:50.359 --> 05:52.193
Has Jay Jansen called?

05:52.194 --> 05:54.111
Jay, no.

05:54.112 --> 05:56.661
Oh, but that boy Sal, he stopped by
to see if your were home.

05:56.662 --> 05:58.240
- Sal?
- Uh-huh.

05:58.241 --> 05:59.743
I'll get it.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.748
Hello, Jay?

06:05.749 --> 06:07.672
Hey, Judy, you almost ready to go?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.211
Um, not quite.

06:10.212 --> 06:12.884
I got stuck after school
helping Mrs. Evans out

06:12.885 --> 06:14.506
with that drive for the homeless.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.226
<i>I told you that was a scam.</i>

06:16.227 --> 06:18.437
Well, someone has to do it.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.974
Well, listen, there's been
a slight change of plan for tonight.

06:21.975 --> 06:23.520
Wh... what do you mean?

06:24.393 --> 06:26.610
<i>I've got a better party to go to.</i>

06:26.611 --> 06:29.152
Does this mean I should find
another date for the dance?

06:29.153 --> 06:30.981
Of course not.

06:30.982 --> 06:32.984
Hey, I thought you'd be happy
to go to a real party.

06:32.985 --> 06:35.361
<i>That school dance is for nerds.</i>

06:35.362 --> 06:37.822
Oh, okay, sure, why not?

06:37.823 --> 06:39.448
Who's giving it?

06:39.449 --> 06:41.326
<i>I don't know if you know her,
her name's Angela.</i>

06:41.327 --> 06:42.785
Angela?

06:42.786 --> 06:45.835
No, the only Angela I know is that
weird girl in history class.

06:46.456 --> 06:49.458
Well, as a matter of fact...

06:49.459 --> 06:51.460
Jay, you've gotta be kidding.

06:51.461 --> 06:54.088
<i>Angela is such a weirdo.</i>

06:54.089 --> 06:57.059
Frannie says she's into witchcraft
and all sorts of creepy stuff.

06:57.968 --> 06:59.968
Come on, you don't believe
all that, do you?

06:59.969 --> 07:01.390
It's a bunch of crap.

07:01.391 --> 07:03.605
<i>Just a lonely old misfit trying
to get some attention</i>

07:03.606 --> 07:05.269
<i>by acting weird, that's all.</i>

07:05.270 --> 07:08.191
So, why in the world would
you want to go to her party then?

07:08.192 --> 07:09.937
Because it's Halloween.

07:09.938 --> 07:11.734
Who do you know
that'll give a better party?

07:11.735 --> 07:12.858
It's like Christmas to her.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.067
Do we have to?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.196
Come on, Max and Frannie are going.

07:17.197 --> 07:18.447
It'll be fun.

07:19.197 --> 07:21.449
Oh, all right, I guess so.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.076
I can't wait to meet her family.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.998
She probably lives in a belfry.

07:25.999 --> 07:28.124
Well, it's...
it's not at her house.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.457
It's at Hull House.

07:29.458 --> 07:32.168
Hull House?
Jay.

07:32.169 --> 07:34.137
Pick you up in 20.

07:51.062 --> 07:53.147
Wow, bodacious boobies, sis.

07:53.148 --> 07:56.448
You keep growin' you'll have to hire
someone just to tie your shoes.

07:56.449 --> 07:58.411
Ooh, out!

08:00.781 --> 08:01.907
<i>I'll get it</i>

08:07.662 --> 08:09.130
Uh!

08:30.143 --> 08:31.352
Boo!

08:31.353 --> 08:33.227
I wish I had a camera.

08:33.229 --> 08:35.823
You looked like
you dropped a load, Junior.

08:35.825 --> 08:37.900
Hey-hey, cool it, squirt.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.573
Who do you think you are,
Rocky Balboa?

08:40.236 --> 08:41.654
Let me go, creep!

08:41.655 --> 08:42.905
Sure.

08:42.905 --> 08:45.659
Now go tell that pretty little piece
you call your sister

08:45.660 --> 08:47.827
that handsome hunk Sal is here.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.081
And tell her I brung my pet
snake for her to play with.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.172
Judy's gettin' ready
for a date, butt hole.

08:53.173 --> 08:55.883
If I were you, I'd get outta here
before he shows up

08:55.884 --> 08:58.503
and turns your ugly face
into a punching bag.

08:58.504 --> 08:59.971
Don't give me that shit, punk.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.013
Go get your sister
before I lose my cool.

09:05.220 --> 09:07.186
What's the matter,
you didn't hear what I said, bozo?

09:07.187 --> 09:09.274
Let me go or I'll yell for my mom.

09:09.275 --> 09:10.766
Aww, go on, baby.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.368
What's the matter,
you can't take a joke?

09:12.477 --> 09:14.353
Now, go get your sister.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.698
Judy's gettin' dressed.
She's goin' to a party.

09:16.699 --> 09:18.732
Party, what party?

09:18.733 --> 09:19.983
Wouldn't you like to know.

09:19.984 --> 09:21.487
Oh, you little asshole.

09:22.070 --> 09:23.195
Oh, Mother!

09:23.196 --> 09:24.905
Hey, hey. hey, hey.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.622
Come on spill the beans, ace.

09:26.623 --> 09:29.743
Here, here's a nice chunk of change
to loosen your lips a little.

09:29.744 --> 09:33.246
Are you kidding, betray my beloved
sister for a measly quarter?

09:33.247 --> 09:34.793
What do you think this is,

09:34.794 --> 09:36.134
some kind of depression
or something?

09:36.135 --> 09:37.418
Oh, that does it.

09:37.419 --> 09:39.513
<i>Billy, did you call me?</i>

09:39.514 --> 09:43.966
Hey, hey, hey,
this is my final offer, kid.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.389
Now take it and sing.

09:46.177 --> 09:47.895
Where's the friggin' party?

09:49.055 --> 09:52.474
Sure, you'll be too chicken
to crash it anyway.

09:52.475 --> 09:53.684
Hey, try me.

09:53.685 --> 09:55.902
- It's at Hull House.
- Hull House?

09:55.903 --> 09:57.988
Huh!
What are trying to pull, Shorty?

09:57.989 --> 10:00.482
Your sister wouldn't be caught dead
in a dump like that.

10:00.483 --> 10:02.360
What do you think I am,
some kind of idiot or what?

10:02.361 --> 10:04.695
What I think is besides the point.

10:04.696 --> 10:06.071
Hull House tonight.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.743
Better be straight, Billy boy.

10:07.744 --> 10:10.290
Or I swear I'm gonna come back here
and kick your little ass.

10:12.203 --> 10:13.580
Hey, my mask.

10:14.039 --> 10:16.292
Yeah, thanks a lot.

10:19.461 --> 10:20.878
Fag.

11:56.057 --> 11:58.310
Do you guys have sour balls?

11:58.643 --> 12:00.020
Why, sure we do.

12:01.312 --> 12:04.316
Too bad, I bet you don't get
many blowjobs.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.118
You think you got enough stuff?

12:16.119 --> 12:18.963
Come on, we don't want to be late
to our own party.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.960
<i>Come on, your face looks fine.</i>

12:24.961 --> 12:27.714
I've never seen anybody spend
more time in a mirror.

12:27.715 --> 12:32.015
Relax, I just want
to look good for the boys.

12:33.094 --> 12:37.389
You did remember to invite some cute
boys to the party I hope.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.558
Of course I did.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.233
And we're gonna scare
the shit out of 'em.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.819
<i>Cutie, Prince
Charming's here.</i>

13:11.299 --> 13:13.552
Well, you must be
Judy's little brother, huh?

13:13.802 --> 13:15.511
Huh, that's pretty lucky.

13:15.512 --> 13:17.512
She's, uh, she's a real nice girl.

13:17.513 --> 13:20.061
Yeah, are you dating her
for her personality

13:20.062 --> 13:21.935
or because she has big cha chas?

13:24.521 --> 13:25.771
Well, hello there.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.613
- You must be Jay.
- Yeah.

13:27.614 --> 13:29.029
Would you like a fudge log?

13:29.818 --> 13:31.735
Oh, gee...

13:31.736 --> 13:34.489
Hey, I'd love to, but I'm trying
to watch my weight.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.656
Oh, your weight...
you must be kidding.

13:36.657 --> 13:37.784
You're skinny as a rail.

13:38.701 --> 13:40.451
Oh, come on, Jay, don't be shy.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.172
Have one... I just took 'em
out of the oven.

13:43.873 --> 13:45.750
No thanks, Mrs. Cassidy, really.

13:45.751 --> 13:47.548
<i>- You're sure.</i>
- Yeah.

13:48.211 --> 13:49.631
Of course, he's sure, Ma.

13:49.632 --> 13:50.879
Why would he want one?

13:50.880 --> 13:52.632
They look like
sun-dried poodle turds.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.305
Billy.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.224
Why me?

13:58.263 --> 14:00.180
Hey, you look great.

14:00.181 --> 14:02.604
You're the best bride
of Frankenstein I ever saw.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.692
Jay, I thought you were gonna
wear a costume.

14:07.693 --> 14:08.734
Well, I was, but I...

14:08.735 --> 14:10.072
He is, he's the boogeyman.

14:10.073 --> 14:11.989
Can't you tell?
He's the pick of the litter.

14:11.990 --> 14:13.737
Billy, please.

14:14.779 --> 14:16.656
Happy Halloween, sweetheart.

14:17.365 --> 14:19.074
Um, we better hurry.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.292
Uh, yeah, Max and
Frannie are waiting.

14:21.293 --> 14:23.505
Good night, girls,
have a nice time.

14:23.506 --> 14:25.123
Enjoy the dance.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.338
God, I'm so embarrassed.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.341
My mom and her cereal box recipes.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.217
Hey, forget it.

14:37.218 --> 14:38.435
Come here.

14:40.805 --> 14:43.307
Jay, slow down, okay?

14:43.308 --> 14:45.686
Yeah, right, sure,
we've got all night.

14:45.687 --> 14:47.062
Come on.

14:51.316 --> 14:53.025
Whoever drew up this map

14:53.026 --> 14:56.236
must have been half blind
and half retarded.

14:56.237 --> 14:57.779
Sounds like Angela.

14:57.780 --> 15:00.073
Dizzy fuckin' bitch, man.

15:00.074 --> 15:02.245
Stooge, did you become an asshole
of your own free will

15:02.246 --> 15:03.618
or were you born that way?

15:03.619 --> 15:06.167
Did you hear somethin' funny?

15:06.168 --> 15:08.585
I don't know why I'm hangin' out
with you two wipes.

15:08.586 --> 15:10.254
- Give me that damn map!
- Hey!

15:10.255 --> 15:12.547
Great, Stooge,
now look what you've done.

15:12.548 --> 15:13.967
- Typical.
- Typical!

15:13.968 --> 15:15.681
Shut up and drive, bitch!

15:16.758 --> 15:18.852
Look here...
turn here!

15:28.353 --> 15:29.728
Well, if the party's a real drag,

15:29.729 --> 15:31.527
we can always come back
to my house.

15:32.649 --> 15:34.026
Here they come.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.952
Well, thank God you two have
the Halloween spirit.

15:41.953 --> 15:44.167
At least I won't be
the only one wearing a costume.

15:44.168 --> 15:46.377
Oh, you didn't really expect
to see Jay in a costume.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.996
Jay's way too cool for that.

15:47.997 --> 15:50.250
Just get in the car, Max.

16:07.058 --> 16:08.275
Great.

16:08.893 --> 16:11.186
Just great.

16:11.187 --> 16:14.064
You know, I always wondered why
they called you Stooge.

16:14.065 --> 16:16.737
Hey, look, I said I
always carry a spare.

16:16.738 --> 16:19.032
I never promised you a tire iron.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.579
You know, we really must have taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.419
No one would give a party out here.

16:27.420 --> 16:31.373
Look, we definitely did not take
any wrong turns, okay?

16:31.374 --> 16:33.045
I know where Hull House is.

16:33.046 --> 16:34.589
It ain't far from here.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.929
So, shut up and start walkin'!

16:37.130 --> 16:38.588
- Great.
- Walk?

16:38.589 --> 16:40.590
Are you fat and dumb?

16:40.591 --> 16:41.763
Hey, here comes a car.

16:41.764 --> 16:43.477
Must be my good karma.

16:44.262 --> 16:46.103
<i>All right, Jay buddy!</i>

16:46.104 --> 16:47.849
<i>You got here just in time, dude.</i>

16:50.268 --> 16:51.565
You guys need a hand?

16:52.103 --> 16:53.571
We sure do.

16:59.402 --> 17:00.995
See ya.

17:07.785 --> 17:11.130
I'm so glad I let you guys
talk me into this.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.804
Shouldn't we at least
help them change their tire?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.423
For Chrissakes, Judy,
it's only a flat tire.

17:21.424 --> 17:23.424
I think even Stooge
can figure that one out.

17:23.425 --> 17:25.598
Hey, there it is, stop the car.

17:32.143 --> 17:34.394
<i>This place was once
a funeral parlor, wasn't it?</i>

17:34.395 --> 17:36.773
<i>Yeah, biggest one
in four counties.</i>

17:36.774 --> 17:39.941
A funeral parlor, way out here?

17:39.942 --> 17:42.864
Sure, it's nice and cozy,
right next to the old cemetery.

17:42.865 --> 17:46.205
And rumor has it, old man Hull
really loved his clientele...

17:46.206 --> 17:47.826
I mean, in the carnal sense.

17:48.659 --> 17:50.409
Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

17:50.410 --> 17:51.958
I once saw a portrait of Mrs. Hull.

17:53.081 --> 17:55.802
<i>I've heard stories about this
place ever since I was a kid.</i>

17:56.334 --> 17:59.133
The Hull family met a pretty
gruesome end, didn't they?

17:59.134 --> 18:00.545
They sure did.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.888
As a matter of fact,
it was on Halloween night.

18:02.889 --> 18:05.635
One of them went crazy
and slaughtered the entire family,

18:05.636 --> 18:07.427
then committed suicide.

18:07.428 --> 18:09.269
They could never figure
out who did it.

18:09.270 --> 18:10.810
Too much blood and guts.

18:11.641 --> 18:14.190
I can't believe
we're gonna party here.

18:16.437 --> 18:18.656
Neither can I.

18:34.372 --> 18:35.542
Hell, that was easy.

18:35.543 --> 18:36.585
Didn't even lock the gate.

18:36.586 --> 18:39.347
Yeah, the county used to keep
this place locked up all the time.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.426
Only the locks kept disappearing.

18:41.427 --> 18:43.137
I guess they finally gave up.

18:43.138 --> 18:46.679
Well, it doesn't look like
much of a party happening here.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.678
Maybe we could still
make the dance.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.942
Max, what are you doing?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.523
I'm just checkin' out
an old legend about this place.

18:59.524 --> 19:00.819
Come here.

19:01.482 --> 19:03.075
<i>Judy, come here, will ya?</i>

19:03.076 --> 19:04.444
<i>Come here, listen.</i>

19:17.832 --> 19:20.176
- Water.
- Yeah, an underground stream.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.045
According to legend,
it completely surrounds the property.

19:24.046 --> 19:26.424
This wall was built
right on top of it.

19:27.008 --> 19:29.680
A brick wall on top
of an underground stream?

19:29.681 --> 19:32.271
Now, there's a stroke
of engineering genius.

19:33.848 --> 19:35.942
Well, the wall was built
to mark the stream.

19:36.392 --> 19:39.360
Uh, supposedly the evil spirits
that haunt the land

19:39.361 --> 19:41.902
can't cross over running water
or something.

19:42.690 --> 19:43.985
Hey, can we go in now?

19:43.986 --> 19:45.610
It's getting kind of chilly
out here.

19:45.902 --> 19:48.325
Shh... listen.

19:49.071 --> 19:50.572
What?

19:50.573 --> 19:52.199
I don't hear anything.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.201
That's what I mean.

19:54.202 --> 19:56.375
Isn't it quiet?

19:57.455 --> 20:01.176
Not even the crickets
will come to this property.

20:01.177 --> 20:02.965
<i>Yeah, right, Max.</i>

20:23.189 --> 20:26.318
Oh, geez.

20:28.110 --> 20:30.362
Somebody fire the maid.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.322
Yeah, somebody did.

20:32.323 --> 20:34.870
The Hull family maid was killed
along with the rest of them.

20:34.871 --> 20:36.665
Someone managed to roast her.

20:36.666 --> 20:39.120
Great, barbecue maid.

20:39.121 --> 20:41.123
No wonder she didn't keep
the place clean.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.800
Can we go home now?

20:49.757 --> 20:51.009
I guess not.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.849
Hey, you guys,
check this out.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.315
Oh, my God.

21:02.103 --> 21:04.606
This must have been left here
by previous tenants.

21:06.190 --> 21:07.861
Okay, everybody hide... quick.

21:07.862 --> 21:08.905
Get rid of your light.

21:09.193 --> 21:10.319
Jay.

21:10.528 --> 21:12.826
Come on, this is gonna be great,
just relax.

21:13.990 --> 21:14.957
Arrgh!

21:19.579 --> 21:21.746
<i>- You dirt bag.
- Jay, no!</i>

21:21.747 --> 21:23.167
Hey, who's side are you on?

21:23.168 --> 21:25.791
Who's side am I on?
You're acting like an idiot.

21:25.792 --> 21:28.761
You were just about to climb in there
and scare somebody else.

21:28.762 --> 21:31.758
Now are you going to punch out Sal
just because he beat you to it?

21:31.759 --> 21:34.175
Yeah, yeah, lighten up, Jay-bo.

21:34.176 --> 21:36.011
It's Halloween.

21:36.012 --> 21:38.809
Good evening,
allow me to introduce myself.

21:38.810 --> 21:42.058
Yeah, Count Dingleberry,
the flaming asshole of Transylvania.

21:42.059 --> 21:44.025
Aw, what's the matter, Maxie baby,

21:44.026 --> 21:46.146
you pissed because I made you
lose your brewski?

21:46.147 --> 21:48.741
Hey, Angela didn't tell me
this asshole was invited.

21:48.899 --> 21:50.526
<i>He wasn't.</i>

21:52.653 --> 21:54.872
<i>All right, dudes!</i>

21:55.281 --> 21:57.283
And dudesses.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.659
Let's party!

22:17.595 --> 22:19.393
Hey, Sal, where do you want this?

22:20.014 --> 22:22.233
Hello, Sal, come in, Sal.
Earth to Sal.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.267
Hey, yo.

22:24.268 --> 22:25.313
Where are we gonna
put this thing, man?

22:25.314 --> 22:26.938
It weighs a fucking ton.

22:59.637 --> 23:01.014
Thanks.

23:02.098 --> 23:04.647
Oh, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

23:04.648 --> 23:05.684
Huh?

23:05.685 --> 23:08.152
I wouldn't leave
that lighter lying there.

23:08.153 --> 23:11.775
We wouldn't want the spirits
to see you littering up their place.

23:11.776 --> 23:13.191
Would we now?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.570
I'm sure they'll make
a federal case out of it.

23:15.571 --> 23:17.913
Oh, have it your way.

23:26.288 --> 23:28.711
Oh, this feels great, really.

23:31.252 --> 23:35.052
- Uhh.
- Just what the doctor ordered.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.398
What'd the wicked witch
of the West want?

23:48.399 --> 23:51.396
- She tryin' to scare ya?
- Of course.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.189
So, did she do it?

23:53.190 --> 23:54.487
Are you kidding?

23:55.151 --> 23:57.110
I'm not a baby.

23:57.111 --> 23:58.328
That's the spirit.

24:17.798 --> 24:21.259
Here, Max, this ought
to cool you down a little.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.343
Thanks, babe.

24:22.344 --> 24:24.972
Oh, how sweet.

24:26.974 --> 24:29.395
- Far fucking out!
- All right! Whew!

24:29.396 --> 24:31.143
I found it in my mother's closet.

24:31.144 --> 24:32.692
She used to be an acid head.

24:32.693 --> 24:34.731
Whoa!

24:34.732 --> 24:36.609
Now we're cooking it up.

25:16.106 --> 25:17.440
Holy shit.

25:17.441 --> 25:19.658
Haven't you idiots ever
heard of Duracell?

25:19.659 --> 25:21.072
Hey, look, don't blame me, man.

25:21.073 --> 25:23.323
I just put batteries
in the damn thing this morning.

25:23.739 --> 25:26.741
I can't live
without my music.

25:26.742 --> 25:30.290
Forget it, there's plenty of time
for dancing later.

25:30.291 --> 25:32.287
Now it's time for party games.

25:32.288 --> 25:35.507
Yeah, we can play post orifice
and you can be the stamp.

25:36.845 --> 25:39.055
Please don't make me ill.

25:40.130 --> 25:44.053
I was thinking of something a
bit more in tune with the holiday.

25:44.054 --> 25:47.681
Like what, bobbing for apples
with razor blades in 'em?

25:48.305 --> 25:52.392
No, I was thinking more
along the lines of a séance.

25:52.393 --> 25:54.066
A séance?

25:54.728 --> 25:56.319
Isn't that a little chancy?

25:56.320 --> 25:57.904
I mean, this is Halloween...

25:57.905 --> 26:01.116
the night when all the creepy things
are supposed to stalk the Earth.

26:01.117 --> 26:02.781
I mean, there's no telling
what we'll dredge up,

26:02.782 --> 26:04.405
especially in this old place.

26:05.489 --> 26:08.533
Hey you guys, how about
a past life séance?

26:08.534 --> 26:09.706
A what?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.036
A past life séance.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.131
You know, we all sit around,
look in a mirror,

26:14.132 --> 26:16.291
and see our past lives.

26:16.292 --> 26:18.386
What kind of drugs
are we gonna need for this?

26:19.837 --> 26:22.338
Cool, will this do?

26:22.339 --> 26:27.095
I'm afraid not, Suzanne, we need one
we can all look into at once.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.355
What the hell was that?

26:33.726 --> 26:36.104
I don't know, buddy,
let's go check it out.

26:37.187 --> 26:39.028
Hey, hey, Stooge,
hey man, cut it out now.

26:39.029 --> 26:40.741
<i>Oh, come on, Rodg,
now don't be afraid.</i>

26:43.736 --> 26:45.945
Come on, Rodg, be a man.

26:45.946 --> 26:47.994
- No, Stooge!
- Yes, Rodg!

27:09.219 --> 27:10.516
Are you okay?

27:12.264 --> 27:14.483
What's the matter, Rodg,
you're white as a ghost.

27:17.519 --> 27:23.242
Hey kids, you're not going to
believe what I found in here.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.406
Oh, it's perfect.

27:30.574 --> 27:32.825
I can't believe our luck.

27:32.826 --> 27:34.952
Maybe this isn't such
a good idea after all.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.377
Well, don't tell me
you're afraid too.

27:38.958 --> 27:42.007
Come on, it's just a mirror,
what harm can it do?

27:47.132 --> 27:49.509
It's really very simple.

27:49.510 --> 27:52.261
You just keep staring
at my reflection in the mirror

27:52.262 --> 27:54.390
until the glass clouds
up all black.

27:55.307 --> 27:59.477
<i>When it clears, we'll see what
I looked like in a past life.</i>

27:59.478 --> 28:01.187
Sounds easy enough to me.

28:01.188 --> 28:03.154
Yeah, right, and if you buy that,

28:03.155 --> 28:05.617
I got this real nifty
bridge to sell ya.

28:06.402 --> 28:08.695
<i>Everybody shut up.</i>

28:08.696 --> 28:12.115
<i>Now, concentrate on my
reflection in the mirror.</i>

28:14.284 --> 28:15.910
<i>Concentrate.</i>

28:15.911 --> 28:19.290
I'm trying to, Ang, but I can't
get past that zit on your chin.

28:20.708 --> 28:22.917
<i>Shut the fuck up, asshole.</i>

28:22.918 --> 28:25.467
<i>If you're not going to help
us along, then get lost.</i>

28:26.088 --> 28:28.386
<i>Okay, now concentrate.</i>

28:29.675 --> 28:31.552
Concentrate.

28:39.143 --> 28:41.020
<i>Holy shit.</i>

28:41.645 --> 28:44.271
You idiot, it was just
starting to work.

28:44.272 --> 28:46.571
<i>It was, I swear I saw
the mirror turning black.</i>

28:46.572 --> 28:48.035
Hey, I saw it too.

29:00.247 --> 29:03.041
- Jeez.
- Why the hell did you do that?

29:03.042 --> 29:04.544
What is wrong with her?

29:04.545 --> 29:06.762
Festerin' fuckwads, uh!

29:07.546 --> 29:10.220
You cannot take
this bitch anywhere, man!

29:11.467 --> 29:14.260
What happened, Helen,
what's the matter?

29:14.261 --> 29:17.138
I saw something in the mirror.

29:17.139 --> 29:18.559
Saw what in the mirror?

29:18.560 --> 29:20.353
Oh, jeez, this bitch has flipped.

29:20.354 --> 29:22.773
Shut up, Stooge,
you're not helping matters!

29:22.774 --> 29:25.021
What?

29:29.526 --> 29:32.029
Probably saw Sal
in that stupid mask.

29:32.030 --> 29:33.738
I wasn't wearing my mask.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.449
Oh, God, that's even worse.

29:36.450 --> 29:39.078
It doesn't matter
what she saw, does it?

29:39.079 --> 29:41.079
If she saw anything.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.748
It looks like our
little game is over.

29:43.749 --> 29:46.673
Yeah, I just hope Helen didn't
piss off the owner of the mirror.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.378
Ow.
I was only kidding.

29:51.757 --> 29:55.343
Oh, no, here we go again.

29:55.344 --> 29:58.888
Relax, it's probably just
someone arriving late.

29:58.889 --> 30:01.813
You guys did invite some
other people to this party?

30:01.814 --> 30:03.518
Angela?

30:03.519 --> 30:06.145
Some cute boys, I hope.

30:09.691 --> 30:12.160
It sounds like it's coming
from the basement.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.642
God, it's freezing in here.

31:26.643 --> 31:29.647
Never mind the draft, man,
who cut the cheese?

31:29.648 --> 31:32.648
Oh, P.U., that is rank.

31:32.649 --> 31:35.571
Stooge must be wearing
his mom's dirty panties again.

31:35.572 --> 31:37.535
Hey, man, as least
my old lady wears panties.

31:37.536 --> 31:40.076
His just wears a coin
changer for sailors.

31:40.077 --> 31:41.666
Your mom couldn't give it away.

31:42.492 --> 31:44.665
God, man, it smells like
somebody died in here.

31:51.752 --> 31:53.798
<i>I don't like what's
happening here.</i>

31:53.799 --> 31:54.840
<i>What do you mean?</i>

31:54.841 --> 31:56.258
<i>I know what she means.</i>

31:56.259 --> 31:58.554
<i>Like, come on, this ain't exactly
the most happenin' party</i>

31:58.555 --> 32:00.676
<i>I ever been to, okay?</i>

32:00.677 --> 32:02.887
What do you mean, Angela?

32:02.888 --> 32:05.892
<i>Those noises that we heard,
there were three of them.</i>

32:05.893 --> 32:09.518
<i>And that awful stink
and then the chill.</i>

32:09.519 --> 32:11.360
<i>It's not cold now.</i>

32:11.361 --> 32:12.821
<i>Must have been a draft.</i>

32:12.822 --> 32:14.940
Well, maybe somebody did come in.

32:14.941 --> 32:16.694
<i>The odor's gone too.</i>

32:16.695 --> 32:18.945
But we all experienced them...

32:18.946 --> 32:22.031
the noise, the stink,
and the chill.

32:22.032 --> 32:24.876
They're all signs of
demonic infestation.

32:24.877 --> 32:26.827
Demonic what?

32:26.828 --> 32:29.413
Demonic whatchamacallit.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.831
I mean, come on!

32:30.832 --> 32:34.553
Little Ang here is just trying to
put the old woo on us, okay?

32:35.504 --> 32:38.381
Yeah, Ang, I'm sure
you're right, okay?

32:38.382 --> 32:41.133
Or could it be that Rodg here
just had too much cold beer

32:41.134 --> 32:44.308
and blew us a cool, stiff breeze
right out of his butt hole?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.608
I don't care what you all think.

32:48.609 --> 32:50.309
My daddy was a preacher.

32:50.310 --> 32:52.733
And I know better than to be in here
fooling with this stuff.

32:53.355 --> 32:55.648
This is a house of the dead.

32:55.649 --> 32:58.152
And I'm gettin' out now
before it's too late.

32:58.944 --> 33:02.574
Wow, hey, take a look at that.

33:05.158 --> 33:06.660
What is that?

33:08.662 --> 33:10.746
It smells like roses.

33:10.747 --> 33:12.918
Hey, you know, I think we're
smelling multiple ghosts here.

33:12.919 --> 33:14.461
I've read about things like this.

33:16.051 --> 33:18.761
That is something, Max...
I never knew you could read.

33:18.762 --> 33:20.505
<i>No, really, Stooge,
I'm not kiddin'.</i>

33:20.506 --> 33:21.633
<i>I read all the time.</i>

33:21.634 --> 33:25.261
Would you listen to me?
They're not ghosts.

33:25.262 --> 33:28.222
This house is not haunted,
it's possessed.

33:28.223 --> 33:31.892
<i>Possessed, man, haunted... come on!</i>

33:31.893 --> 33:33.019
<i>Who gives a shit!</i>

33:33.020 --> 33:36.647
What's the difference between
possessed and haunted?

33:36.648 --> 33:39.900
A haunted house is a house
with ghosts in it...

33:39.901 --> 33:42.486
the spirits of people who've died.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.865
But the spirits living
in a house possessed

33:44.866 --> 33:47.658
have never existed in human form.

33:47.659 --> 33:51.078
They've only existed
in spirit form.

33:51.079 --> 33:53.289
They're pure evil.

33:53.290 --> 33:54.623
They're demons.

33:54.624 --> 33:56.417
Kids, come on,

33:56.418 --> 34:00.046
you can't really believe
this place is possessed?

34:00.047 --> 34:02.214
Nah, just repossessed.

34:09.556 --> 34:11.853
For tonight anyway.

34:16.396 --> 34:18.188
Maybe Rodger's right.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.982
Maybe we should leave.

34:19.983 --> 34:21.701
Aw, come on, let's hang out.

34:21.702 --> 34:24.652
Yeah, eat a bowl of fuck!

34:24.654 --> 34:27.739
I am here to party.

34:27.741 --> 34:30.076
Me too.

34:30.077 --> 34:33.829
Just because one lame
wuss wants to bail,

34:33.830 --> 34:36.299
doesn't mean we ace this party.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.418
I want to go too.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.004
We'll need a ride.

34:42.005 --> 34:43.846
Hey, don't look at me, pal,

34:43.847 --> 34:47.092
my cruiser's sittin' in a ditch
two miles from here, huh?

34:47.092 --> 34:49.347
Hey, you know, you could spend
the night in it, though,

34:49.348 --> 34:51.972
if you wanted to.
<i>Oooh.</i>

34:51.973 --> 34:54.475
Here, Rodg, take Angie's car.

34:54.476 --> 34:56.319
Hey, what the fuck
do you think you're do...

34:56.320 --> 34:58.437
Chill out, hon.

34:58.438 --> 35:01.362
It's your party,
you ain't goin' anywhere.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.778
Thanks Suzanne.

35:04.277 --> 35:05.486
Don't mention it.

35:05.487 --> 35:08.034
I don't care
if you're a chicken shit.

35:08.035 --> 35:11.706
Just remember to open the gate
before you drive through it.

35:13.161 --> 35:14.745
<i>Bye Rodg.</i>

35:14.746 --> 35:16.419
Drive carefully, you guys.

35:18.875 --> 35:20.343
Let's party.

35:21.586 --> 35:23.379
Yeah.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.176
Yeah, well you guys
can count us out.

35:25.177 --> 35:26.923
Judy and I have some
exploring to do.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.220
<i>Yeah, great idea.</i>

35:28.221 --> 35:29.763
Let's see what kind of action
we can dig up

35:29.764 --> 35:31.763
in this glorious old dump,
huh, cutie?

35:31.764 --> 35:33.055
I don't know, Jay.

35:33.056 --> 35:34.226
Oh, come on, Judy.

35:34.227 --> 35:37.522
Who knows, maybe we'll be able
to find a little privacy.

35:37.523 --> 35:39.440
Hey, we'll check you guys out later.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.780
Don't do anything stupid
while we're gone, huh?

35:41.781 --> 35:45.198
Yeah, right, you all say hi
to Casper for me.

35:46.069 --> 35:49.573
Well, this party's gettin'
down to the cream now.

35:51.408 --> 35:53.877
I think I'm gonna go
find the bathroom.

35:55.036 --> 35:58.289
Mm, good idea,
I'll go too to protect ya.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.260
Oh, no thanks,
I'd rather take Stooge.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.419
Stooge?

36:03.420 --> 36:05.754
Hey, you heard the lady, man.

36:05.755 --> 36:08.381
She wants a real man
guardin' her charms.

36:08.382 --> 36:09.680
Stooge is a fat pig.

36:11.052 --> 36:13.475
Maybe I'm in the mood
for pork tonight.

36:47.130 --> 36:51.008
I'm into all sorts
of things tonight.

36:51.009 --> 36:55.059
I'll tell you what, babe,
I'll hold yours, if you hold mine.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.977
I don't fuckin' believe this.

37:21.414 --> 37:23.041
Jeez.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.137
Hey, you know what?

37:29.130 --> 37:32.100
This reminds me of a great story.

37:33.677 --> 37:36.851
You know, I think we've heard
enough stories for one night.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.431
No, come on, let's hear it.

37:39.432 --> 37:41.730
<i>All right, but only
because you asked.</i>

37:48.984 --> 37:52.284
Oh, God, this one better be it
or I'm gonna water the hallway.

37:52.285 --> 37:54.998
- No, try this one.
- What?

37:59.327 --> 38:01.500
<i>Well, all right, Suzie-Q!</i>

38:02.539 --> 38:04.086
How did you know this?

38:04.499 --> 38:06.467
Ladies before germs.

38:08.169 --> 38:10.217
No, wait, um...

38:12.799 --> 38:16.679
I thought... well, I thought maybe
we might could go in there together?

38:16.680 --> 38:18.021
Huh?

38:19.306 --> 38:21.354
Fuckin' party.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.621
Whoa, Jesus!
Fuck!

38:43.622 --> 38:46.341
Shit! Shit!

38:47.500 --> 38:51.048
Yeah, but even before the first
white settlers colonized this area,

38:51.049 --> 38:53.344
this strip of land already
had a bad rep.

38:53.345 --> 38:54.423
Sure, Max.

38:54.424 --> 38:57.301
Mm-mm... For centuries,
the ancient Indian tribes

38:57.302 --> 38:59.678
that used to live around this
area would never set foot

38:59.679 --> 39:01.350
on this side of the
underground creek.

39:01.351 --> 39:04.022
Even back then, they said
the land was unclean.

39:04.023 --> 39:05.142
Right, Max.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.463
And I suppose the ghost
of an ancient Indian told you that.

39:07.771 --> 39:10.314
No, Mrs. Porter down at the library

39:10.315 --> 39:12.236
gave me a book that one
of the earlier settlers wrote.

39:12.237 --> 39:15.656
I mean, you cannot believe all the cool
shit that used to go down here.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.298
Yeah, especially since they didn't have
any indoor plumbing, right?

39:19.616 --> 39:21.368
No, really.

39:22.911 --> 39:25.079
A young brave got lost

39:25.080 --> 39:27.549
and settled here
with his family by mistake.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.253
Anyway, they found him
three weeks later

39:32.087 --> 39:36.056
sitting under a tepee he made
out of his squaw's intestines

39:36.057 --> 39:38.472
and chewing on the leg
of his papoose.

39:38.473 --> 39:39.968
Oh, gross.

39:39.969 --> 39:44.065
I've never heard so many
disgusting stories in all my life.

39:50.230 --> 39:52.981
Oh, um, you know, I think it's time

39:52.982 --> 39:56.111
that, you know, Frannie and I
did some exploring on our own.

39:59.781 --> 40:01.374
Happy Halloween.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.991
Happy hunting.

40:02.992 --> 40:04.162
Yeah, this place is big enough.

40:04.163 --> 40:06.629
I'm sure we'll find somethin'
interesting to do, right?

40:14.254 --> 40:17.599
Well, Alice, looks like
we're all alone in Wonderland.

40:20.260 --> 40:21.677
Well, what gives?

40:21.678 --> 40:23.387
Not here, Jay.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.140
What do you mean, "not here?"

40:25.141 --> 40:28.559
This place, it's...
it's too creepy.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.855
Well, that's the whole idea.

40:29.856 --> 40:32.322
You're supposed to be
jumping into my arms.

40:32.323 --> 40:34.236
Just hold me.

40:41.197 --> 40:43.949
Where the fuck is
the God damn gate?

40:43.950 --> 40:45.996
We came in through
a gate, didn't we?

40:45.997 --> 40:47.667
This just doesn't make sense.

40:47.668 --> 40:49.705
Give up already.

40:49.706 --> 40:52.459
Give up?
Now, what kind of talk is that?

40:52.460 --> 40:54.084
There was a gate here.

40:54.085 --> 40:56.179
And if we just keep following
this damn wall,

40:56.180 --> 40:57.838
we're bound to find it.

40:57.839 --> 41:00.308
Look, we've already
been around it twice.

41:00.309 --> 41:03.177
Don't you understand, Rodg?
We're dead.

41:03.178 --> 41:05.021
We've all died and gone to hell.

41:06.431 --> 41:08.056
What are you talking about?

41:08.057 --> 41:09.978
Are you goin' crazy on me, girl?

41:09.979 --> 41:11.942
Look, if that's all
that's on your mind,

41:11.943 --> 41:13.734
you just better shut
that mouth of yours.

41:13.735 --> 41:16.398
Shit!
Hell, my ass!

41:16.399 --> 41:18.400
There is a gate here.

41:18.401 --> 41:19.778
There is!

41:32.373 --> 41:33.966
Oh, sweet mother.

41:34.709 --> 41:36.794
Helen?

41:36.795 --> 41:38.138
Helen!

41:40.215 --> 41:41.808
This isn't funny, girl.

41:45.887 --> 41:47.137
Helen?

41:47.138 --> 41:48.731
Where the hell did she go?

41:49.891 --> 41:52.565
<i>Rodger.</i>

41:56.856 --> 41:58.779
<i>Rodg.</i>

42:01.945 --> 42:04.198
Oh, heaven help me.

42:05.406 --> 42:07.079
<i>Rodger!</i>

42:36.521 --> 42:39.439
Jay, hold it.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.441
Judy, come on.

42:41.442 --> 42:43.820
Quit the act, I know
you've done this before.

42:43.821 --> 42:44.862
What?

42:44.863 --> 42:47.489
I saw the way
you jumped to Sal's aid.

42:47.490 --> 42:49.242
Jay, what are you getting at?

42:49.243 --> 42:51.285
I know all about you two.

42:51.286 --> 42:53.755
Oh, really.
What do you know?

42:54.831 --> 42:56.331
Nothing.

42:56.332 --> 42:58.505
I just know that you used
to date Sal, that's all.

42:58.960 --> 43:02.087
Date him?
I went out with him once.

43:02.088 --> 43:04.214
Once is all it takes.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.762
I don't understand why
you're acting like this.

43:06.763 --> 43:08.475
Half the school knows
about you and Sal,

43:08.476 --> 43:09.889
so what's the big deal?

43:09.890 --> 43:11.684
Oh, so you think I slept with Sal

43:11.685 --> 43:13.683
just because I went out with him.

43:13.684 --> 43:15.060
Didn't you?

43:16.477 --> 43:18.650
You know,
that's none of your business.

43:21.149 --> 43:23.275
So, that's why you wanted
to go out with me?

43:23.276 --> 43:26.621
Oh, come on, I thought you wanted it
just as much as I did.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.169
<i>Jesus.</i>

43:37.373 --> 43:40.459
Fine, have it your way.

43:40.460 --> 43:42.007
I'm outta here.

43:42.629 --> 43:44.882
Jay, wait.

43:48.384 --> 43:50.057
Come on, Jay.

43:50.970 --> 43:52.722
Jay.

44:07.195 --> 44:09.038
Come on, Jay!

44:13.618 --> 44:15.837
Damn it, bitch, come on.

44:16.829 --> 44:20.424
<i>What'd you do, flush yourself
down the fuckin' toilet, or what?</i>

44:39.686 --> 44:41.814
Open the damn door already!

44:48.403 --> 44:49.655
Suzanne.

44:57.912 --> 44:59.746
What the fuck?

45:08.923 --> 45:10.470
Jesus!

45:13.720 --> 45:15.347
Suzanne?

45:35.533 --> 45:37.376
Dizzy bitch.

45:45.960 --> 45:50.714
Hey, Ang, what the fuck are
you doin' over there?

45:55.678 --> 45:58.138
Blessed be the sinners,

45:58.139 --> 46:00.392
for the day of atonement
is at hand.

46:00.393 --> 46:01.608
<i>Say what?</i>

49:24.220 --> 49:27.305
Whoa, Sal, easy man.
A little jumpy, huh?

49:27.306 --> 49:28.556
Yeah.

49:28.557 --> 49:31.685
Well, all right,
now the party's back.

49:31.686 --> 49:33.770
And so is Stoogie.

49:33.771 --> 49:36.570
Hey, careful, man,
she's actin' really fuckin' weird.

49:36.571 --> 49:37.899
Don't worry, Sal,

49:37.900 --> 49:40.196
it ain't the weird ones
you gotta watch out for.

49:40.197 --> 49:42.697
God, didn't your mom teach
you nothin' about women?

49:42.698 --> 49:44.244
Oh...

49:58.254 --> 50:02.509
So, Ang, ya come here often?

50:11.392 --> 50:15.397
You know, Stooge, I never
realized how sexy you are.

50:17.189 --> 50:18.773
Kiss me.

50:18.774 --> 50:20.776
Oh.

51:17.208 --> 51:19.882
Suzanne, lights.

51:22.922 --> 51:25.425
I'm fixing my face.

51:26.467 --> 51:29.636
Aw, shit, not you too?

51:29.637 --> 51:31.933
What, is everybody here
on drugs or somethin'?

51:31.934 --> 51:33.772
You know, you're a sweet
lookin' babe, Suzanne,

51:33.773 --> 51:37.361
but you and your friend, Ang,
are just a little too weirdo for me.

51:38.562 --> 51:41.441
I can't seem to get it right.

51:41.816 --> 51:44.192
No thanks, honey,
I'm not that type of guy.

51:44.193 --> 51:46.036
Good night, now, I'm going home.

51:46.037 --> 51:48.571
You are home, Sal.

51:48.572 --> 51:51.619
Un-uh, this dirty dive
don't spell home to me.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.083
I live in a nice house, you know,

51:53.084 --> 51:55.125
with plastic slip covers
on the furniture.

51:55.871 --> 51:57.999
Enjoy your lipstick, dollface.

51:58.416 --> 51:59.668
Good night.

52:48.382 --> 52:52.635
My word, I can't believe
all this stuff is still here.

52:52.636 --> 52:54.679
It's creepy in here.

52:54.680 --> 52:56.728
Don't worry, I'll protect ya.

52:57.892 --> 53:00.435
And who's gonna protect you?

53:02.021 --> 53:04.820
You know, I've never made it
in a coffin before.

53:04.821 --> 53:06.317
Me neither.

53:09.403 --> 53:12.282
So, what are we waitin' for?

54:00.162 --> 54:01.664
<i>Suzanne?</i>

54:04.542 --> 54:06.169
What are you doing?

54:11.507 --> 54:14.133
Now, that's not a bad paint job.

54:14.134 --> 54:16.808
But I think that it needs
a little touching up.

54:19.265 --> 54:20.858
Hey, when did the lights go on?

54:30.359 --> 54:32.236
Okay, forget the lights.

54:38.867 --> 54:41.245
Hey, Ang, I'm splittin'.

54:43.789 --> 54:45.004
Oh, there you are.

54:45.005 --> 54:47.377
I was just warming
my hands in the fire.

54:53.716 --> 54:55.389
Holy shit!

55:05.060 --> 55:07.188
Leaving so soon?

55:52.816 --> 55:55.319
Jeez, what an asshole.

55:56.570 --> 56:00.031
Stooge, I know that's you, man.

56:00.032 --> 56:04.082
Only a fat slob like you
could shake this car so much.

56:38.237 --> 56:39.739
<i>Yeah.</i>

56:42.241 --> 56:43.618
All right.

56:44.785 --> 56:47.254
<i>Look at you.</i>

56:47.663 --> 56:49.006
Come here.

57:12.521 --> 57:14.023
What are you looking at?

57:15.149 --> 57:16.321
What?

57:16.817 --> 57:18.535
Is my makeup okay?

57:18.986 --> 57:21.159
Are you crazy, what are
you talkin' about?

57:22.406 --> 57:24.615
Stop staring at me.

57:24.616 --> 57:26.833
Damn it, Suzanne,
your makeup is fine.

57:26.834 --> 57:28.829
Come on, what are
you worried about?

57:30.205 --> 57:33.040
Uh!
Jesus Christ!

57:33.041 --> 57:35.126
Stop looking at me!

57:35.127 --> 57:38.222
Uh!
God damn it!

57:51.268 --> 57:52.690
What was that?

57:53.437 --> 57:55.439
Uh, it's more party games.

57:56.732 --> 57:59.275
Ow, Max, I don't bend that way.

57:59.276 --> 58:00.735
<i>Uh, shit.</i>

58:00.736 --> 58:02.989
Damn it, this is worse
than my brother's VDub.

58:06.241 --> 58:08.118
Hey, man, get the fuck outta here!

58:10.417 --> 58:11.454
No!

58:11.455 --> 58:14.332
<i>No!</i>

58:14.333 --> 58:15.875
<i>No, Stooge!</i>

58:15.876 --> 58:18.294
No, Stooge, no!

58:18.295 --> 58:20.218
<i>Not... no!</i>

58:23.217 --> 58:24.634
No, please.

58:45.072 --> 58:46.790
<i>Welcome back, Rodger.</i>

58:55.791 --> 58:56.916
Uh!

58:56.917 --> 58:58.510
Sal, move!

59:05.342 --> 59:08.261
Something...
It's Angela, man!

59:08.262 --> 59:10.308
- She's... she's...
- Hey, I know, I know...

59:10.309 --> 59:12.681
I know there's some really weird shit
going on around here.

59:12.682 --> 59:14.310
Something happened to Helen.

59:14.311 --> 59:15.518
What do you mean?

59:15.519 --> 59:18.441
I don't know, man, I don't know.

59:18.442 --> 59:21.189
Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, man.

59:21.190 --> 59:22.532
We're gonna get outta here, man.

59:22.533 --> 59:24.694
We're gonna get outta here.
We're gonna get outta here.

59:57.394 --> 59:58.862
Jay?

59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.277
Jay, is that you?

01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:04.944
<i>Jay?</i>

01:00:05.527 --> 01:00:07.325
Let me outta here.

01:00:07.821 --> 01:00:09.949
<i>This way, come on,
follow me.</i>

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:13.752
Jay.

01:00:36.475 --> 01:00:37.600
Come on.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:38.896
I knew we shouldn't have come here.

01:00:38.897 --> 01:00:40.018
We're never gonna
get outta here, man.

01:00:40.019 --> 01:00:42.864
Shut up, Rodg, shut up,
I swear I'm gonna slug you!

01:00:47.486 --> 01:00:48.952
What's that?

01:00:48.953 --> 01:00:51.572
<i>Help!
Somebody get me outta here.</i>

01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:53.792
Hold it!
How do we know it's really her?

01:00:53.793 --> 01:00:55.159
Come on... Judy?

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.410
<i>Get me out, Sal.</i>

01:00:56.411 --> 01:00:57.956
<i>Please get me outta here.</i>

01:00:57.957 --> 01:00:59.250
Sure thing, Judy, stand back.

01:00:59.251 --> 01:01:01.043
Wait!
What if it's not her?

01:01:01.044 --> 01:01:02.793
Come on, Rodg,
who else could it be?

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:39.959
- Come on, get up, Judy!
- I can't!

01:01:42.457 --> 01:01:44.209
<i>I can't!</i>

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.091
Yes, you can!
Come on!

01:02:13.989 --> 01:02:15.411
Hey, there's no boards on it.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.503
Hey, how 'bout an orgy?

01:02:29.713 --> 01:02:33.809
I'm sure if we try,
we can get Jay hard again.

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.595
Run, Judy!
<i>Run, Judy, run!</i>

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:52.568
Run, Judy, run.

01:02:52.569 --> 01:02:55.197
See Judy run.

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:21.556
<i>An air shaft?</i>

01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:31.695
No wonder why there weren't
any boards on the window.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.022
Can't get the fuck outta here.

01:05:43.782 --> 01:05:45.705
Thank heaven for water pipes.

01:06:52.851 --> 01:06:54.148
Rodger.

01:08:43.877 --> 01:08:45.255
<i>Judy!</i>

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:47.589
Judy.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.807
Shh.

01:08:55.974 --> 01:08:57.350
Judy, look out!

01:08:59.018 --> 01:09:01.237
Enjoying the view?

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:03.357
Judy!

01:09:24.085 --> 01:09:26.795
Oh, God, please don't let me fall!

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:28.844
Judy, work your way over this way.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:37.352
Come on, Judy.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.528
Yeah, come on,
just a little further.

01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:52.196
I can't do it!

01:09:52.197 --> 01:09:53.947
Yes, you can!

01:09:53.948 --> 01:09:55.541
Come on, woman, do it!

01:10:00.205 --> 01:10:01.673
<i>Don't look down, girl.</i>

01:10:03.708 --> 01:10:05.802
Oh, Sal!

01:10:06.544 --> 01:10:08.797
Come on.
You're almost home.

01:10:11.299 --> 01:10:14.428
God... Judy, hurry up!

01:10:21.976 --> 01:10:23.018
You all right?

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:25.989
Yeah, I think so.

01:10:36.991 --> 01:10:39.289
Oh, don't tell me you're leaving?

01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:43.256
Sal wanted to go,
but he decided to stick around.

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:06.915
Oh, God.

01:12:14.255 --> 01:12:17.805
Shh, Rodg, come on,
it'll be all right.

01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:20.144
Please don't cry.

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:24.014
We're gonna make it.

01:12:24.015 --> 01:12:25.892
I know we're gonna make it.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:29.900
You really think so?

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:34.274
You already saved
my life once tonight, didn't you?

01:12:34.275 --> 01:12:37.028
That had to be for something,
right, Rodg?

01:12:37.029 --> 01:12:38.496
I guess so.

01:12:48.539 --> 01:12:49.961
There's a door.

01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:53.173
Look, Rodg.

01:12:54.128 --> 01:12:55.837
Maybe we can get out.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:56.922
<i>A door?</i>

01:12:56.923 --> 01:12:58.015
Yeah, look.

01:12:58.466 --> 01:13:01.720
Judy, wait, don't!

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.054
We can't wait, Rodg.

01:13:04.055 --> 01:13:06.014
We gotta try.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:07.813
There's no other way out.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.727
First, let's pray.

01:13:10.728 --> 01:13:13.106
My daddy, he told me how
to pray real good.

01:13:13.107 --> 01:13:14.356
Come on.

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:16.858
I've been praying all night, Rodg.

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.611
We gotta go now.

01:13:38.756 --> 01:13:40.841
My God, what is this?

01:13:40.842 --> 01:13:43.345
There's all this pipe running
along the wall.

01:13:43.346 --> 01:13:45.017
It's weird.

01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:07.289
<i>What, what's wrong?</i>

01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:12.082
It's an oven.

01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:13.841
A what?

01:14:14.625 --> 01:14:16.548
It's an oven, Rodg.

01:14:17.879 --> 01:14:19.552
This is a crematorium.

01:14:54.749 --> 01:14:57.000
<i>Open the door, Rodg.</i>

01:14:57.001 --> 01:14:59.343
<i>We don't want you,
we want the bitch.</i>

01:14:59.344 --> 01:15:01.884
<i>You know we'd never hurt
a nice little boy like you.</i>

01:15:01.885 --> 01:15:03.631
Go to hell, you dirty bastards!

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:06.259
<i>Well, not tonight, my boy.
Oh, no, not tonight.</i>

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.890
<i>Rest assured we've got something
wonderful planned for you.</i>

01:15:09.891 --> 01:15:13.850
<i>So much pain.
So much sorrow.</i>

01:15:13.851 --> 01:15:16.104
Did you hear what they said, Rodg?

01:15:16.105 --> 01:15:17.446
Not tonight.

01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:20.317
They won't go
to hell tonight because...

01:15:20.318 --> 01:15:23.115
because it's Halloween, right?

01:15:23.903 --> 01:15:27.077
That's why they won't go
to hell tonight, right?

01:15:28.533 --> 01:15:31.082
Because it's the one night
of the year they don't have to.

01:15:32.078 --> 01:15:34.412
Remember what Helen said, Rodg?

01:15:34.413 --> 01:15:38.416
Didn't she say that tonight's
a special night of evil?

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:39.918
Remember?

01:15:39.919 --> 01:15:42.466
Didn't she say that tonight's
the one night of the year

01:15:42.467 --> 01:15:45.467
when all things unclean are free
to roam among us?

01:15:45.468 --> 01:15:47.092
<i>Remember?</i>

01:15:47.093 --> 01:15:49.437
<i>That's what she said,
Rodg, right?</i>

01:15:51.097 --> 01:15:53.848
I think if we just
hang out here until... till dawn,

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.022
we'll be all right.

01:15:55.977 --> 01:15:58.150
Yeah... yeah.

01:15:59.063 --> 01:16:00.235
I bet you're right.

01:16:00.236 --> 01:16:01.857
<i>Judy?</i>

01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:06.204
Oh, dear God, no.

01:16:08.072 --> 01:16:10.700
<i>I warned you this house
was possessed.</i>

01:16:10.701 --> 01:16:11.950
<i>Didn't I?</i>

01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:13.544
We can't let them get us, Rodg.

01:16:14.412 --> 01:16:16.005
<i>We can't give up, Rodg.</i>

01:16:20.751 --> 01:16:22.048
We've gotta find a weapon.

01:16:23.963 --> 01:16:24.964
A Pipe.

01:16:51.616 --> 01:16:54.415
Gas.

01:17:47.171 --> 01:17:49.839
I can't stop it, Rodg, help me!

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.592
<i>Please come and help me!</i>

01:17:52.551 --> 01:17:54.974
Find the valve, Rodg, the valve.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:23.873
Rodger, wait.

01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:52.702
Rodger.

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:57.287
We can't get out.
We can't get out.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.460
Rodger.

01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:07.625
- Judy.
- Oh, Jay, no.

01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:10.971
Why hast thou forsaken me?

01:19:11.464 --> 01:19:13.592
What's the matter, Judy?

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:17.353
Don't you like your blind date?

01:19:50.586 --> 01:19:51.883
You won't get me!

01:19:57.134 --> 01:19:58.681
Rodger!

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:11.403
I'm alive.

01:20:12.316 --> 01:20:13.568
I'm alive.

01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:24.452
Hey, we're out.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:26.455
No, Rodg, we have
to get past the wall.

01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:30.460
We have to cross over
the underground stream.

01:20:33.754 --> 01:20:35.675
- Where are you going?
- We have to get to the gate!

01:20:35.676 --> 01:20:37.514
- There is no gate.
- The gate's over here, Rodg!

01:20:37.515 --> 01:20:39.260
There is no gate, come on!

01:20:41.095 --> 01:20:42.392
<i>Ow!</i>

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:44.724
Ow!

01:20:45.266 --> 01:20:47.564
<i>Rodger!</i>

01:21:02.199 --> 01:21:04.748
Judy, give me your hand.
Come on.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:28.313
Help me, Rodger!

01:21:55.544 --> 01:21:59.380
Judy, Rodger, where you going?

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:01.591
The party's just begun.

01:22:05.471 --> 01:22:06.643
Rodger!

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:28.036
Help, Rodger, help!

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:38.554
Rodger, help!

01:22:44.551 --> 01:22:46.553
Climb, girl, climb!

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:35.870
Rotten pig trash.

01:24:35.871 --> 01:24:37.714
Been out all night, huh?

01:24:41.668 --> 01:24:44.045
Eh, they'll all rot in hell.

01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:45.889
Huh, kids.

01:25:12.241 --> 01:25:13.866
Good morning, dear.

01:25:13.867 --> 01:25:16.244
Yeah, what's so good about it?

01:25:16.245 --> 01:25:18.668
Better drink your coffee
before it gets cold.

01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:20.041
Eh.

01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:24.671
Is it good, dear?

01:25:25.504 --> 01:25:27.757
Nah, it's okay.

01:25:28.674 --> 01:25:30.425
Just okay?

01:25:30.426 --> 01:25:33.270
You used to love my homemade pies.

01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:37.098
Homemade?

01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:38.644
When did you make this?

01:25:38.645 --> 01:25:40.688
I've been up for hours, sleepyhead.

01:25:40.689 --> 01:25:42.984
I made it while you were getting
your beauty rest.

01:25:43.689 --> 01:25:45.106
Last night?

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:47.781
There weren't as many
trick-or-treaters last night.

01:25:47.782 --> 01:25:49.617
Not like the good old days.

01:25:49.618 --> 01:25:52.829
I had to do something
with all those leftover apples.

01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:55.793
I still can't understand why
you buy so many.

01:26:02.708 --> 01:26:03.749
<i>Uh!</i>

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:19.600
Happy Halloween, dear.
