00:06.907 --> 00:09.818
Everyone knows
the story of Cinderella.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.021
A poor girl, dreams of
 going to the royal ball.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.892
Her dream comes true with
the help of a fairy god-mother.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.194
But when the spell is
 reversed at midnight,

00:19.219 --> 00:21.129
she runs away.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.900
The prince searches
 throughout the kingdom.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.800
He finally finds her.

00:25.826 --> 00:29.772
And of course, they
 lived happily ever after.

00:29.797 --> 00:30.840
But...

00:30.864 --> 00:34.242
..my story is very different.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.178
And how do I know the truth?

00:36.203 --> 00:38.500
Because I was here.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.107
Here.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.654
And here.

00:44.510 --> 00:46.610
Ooh, something smells good.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.784
Ella never dissapoints us.
Let's go!

00:51.351 --> 00:54.630
Easy peacy lemon squeesy.
Ah!

01:10.304 --> 01:13.649
You look tired ,you
should work out more.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.082
Let me show you how its done.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.722
Oh-oh. Move to the right.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.057
Move to the left!

01:22.082 --> 01:24.392
Extend your back muscles.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.695
Oh! Stir your--

01:25.719 --> 01:27.195
Oh, no!

01:28.689 --> 01:32.660
- Hah?
--stretch long long and-- Hah?

01:34.995 --> 01:36.941
Hey, be careful.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.206
What the--?

01:44.304 --> 01:45.305
No!

01:46.807 --> 01:47.842
Gotcha!

02:04.057 --> 02:05.695
- Oh! Oh!
- I can't watch!

02:25.913 --> 02:27.114
Come on!

02:27.514 --> 02:28.646
Ella!

02:28.670 --> 02:29.670
- Hah?
- Hah?

02:29.994 --> 02:30.994
Oh?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.190
Where are you?

02:35.055 --> 02:36.557
Coming, stepmother!

02:44.464 --> 02:47.307
I tried a new recipe.
I hope you like it.

02:50.203 --> 02:51.607
Oh, no!
Hmh.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.515
Well, it's a good thing
 you can cook.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.883
And clean.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.988
-She is so talented, isn't she?
- Ha-ha.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.093
What are you doing here?

03:04.117 --> 03:06.928
- This wasn't my idea.
- What?

03:06.953 --> 03:10.064
- What are you mumbling about?
 - Nothing.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.367
Everything is just fine.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.304
So, this is your new recipe?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.004
Ah! Let me get that for you.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.951
Oh, no!

03:36.216 --> 03:37.622
What is that?

03:38.251 --> 03:39.589
Guys! Run!

03:42.522 --> 03:45.025
Get out!
Get that filthy mouse!

03:50.897 --> 03:52.103
Stop it!

03:53.300 --> 03:54.804
Kill him!

03:58.539 --> 04:00.018
Get away from me!

04:00.042 --> 04:01.642
Hah?

04:07.147 --> 04:08.457
Take that!

04:09.816 --> 04:11.256
Let's go!

04:17.023 --> 04:18.565
Light as a feather.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.933
Light as a feather.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.415
Sorry..

04:33.574 --> 04:34.817
Yah! Get him!

04:35.141 --> 04:37.018
Missed me! 
Try harder!

04:42.115 --> 04:43.760
Filthy mice!

04:43.884 --> 04:45.864
Get away from me!

04:48.088 --> 04:49.089
This way.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.334
Get those mice!

04:53.360 --> 04:56.034
What? I can't hear you!

04:59.099 --> 05:01.110
Ella! What are you doing?

05:01.134 --> 05:02.841
They're getting away!

05:02.969 --> 05:04.379
I've gotten rid of them!

05:04.404 --> 05:07.014
How dare you, let those
 mice get away!

05:07.040 --> 05:09.543
Then, there is no dinner
 for you this month!

05:12.078 --> 05:14.319
I just need to eat
 a bit earlier.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.126
Those guys!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.537
You three.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.107
Why did you do that?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.812
Do what?

05:34.868 --> 05:37.178
Why do you always go stealing?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.840
Only me?

05:40.907 --> 05:42.750
We shouldn't steal food.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.478
What do we eat then?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.322
We'll go out look for food.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.224
No. It's too dangeorus.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.354
Here, you can have
some of mine.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.260
Just don't do that again.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.033
Thank you,Ella.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.002
You're welcome.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.998
You're the best!

06:05.065 --> 06:07.011
Oh, you gonna finish that?

06:07.434 --> 06:08.970
Seriously?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.425
He doesn't really
act like a mouse.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.124
You think food tastes
 better that way?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.963
You seemed different.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.162
- It's almost like ...
- Like what?

06:31.558 --> 06:33.560
Like a... gentleman.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.935
I wish I was.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.500
Does he think he's
 human or something?

07:05.525 --> 07:08.131
I wish I could 
dance like that.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.960
I can't wait to go.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.329
It's going to be thrilling!

08:08.354 --> 08:10.264
- Oh..Hah?
- That's so exciting!

08:10.290 --> 08:13.328
I can't wait to wear
 my fancy dress.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.234
What are you two
 talking about?

08:16.396 --> 08:19.374
There's going to be
 a royal ball at the palace.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.143
A royal ball?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.544
Well, what are
 we waiting for?

08:23.570 --> 08:25.047
Quick, get dressed!

08:25.071 --> 08:26.280
Absolutly!

08:26.306 --> 08:27.382
I can't wait.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.013
I will wear that 
beautiful red dress!

08:30.577 --> 08:32.453
A royal ball!

08:32.479 --> 08:34.116
- You think they'll have food?
- Ha-ha.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.784
Why are you looking
at me like that?

08:38.017 --> 08:40.019
Ella, you should go.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.962
Why would I want to go there?

08:45.892 --> 08:48.202
Prince is going to
 choose a princess.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.809
I don't want to be
chosen to be a princess.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.278
I heard that the prince
 is pretty charming.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.948
So?

08:59.500 --> 09:01.183
The palace is huge.

09:01.508 --> 09:07.289
Filled with chandeliers, marble
 floors, artwork, tapestry .

09:07.313 --> 09:08.823
How do you know that?

09:08.848 --> 09:11.522
He's probably been there,
stealing something.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.491
So..you guys really
 want to go?

09:18.424 --> 09:20.370
Fine. Let's go.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.962
- Oh,shoot!
- It's great!

09:24.931 --> 09:26.842
What are you guys
 waiting for?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.940
And that?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.709
What's wrong with it?

09:33.439 --> 09:34.415
Are...

09:34.440 --> 09:35.449
..You..

09:35.475 --> 09:36.852
..sure?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.080
Why not?

09:38.444 --> 09:41.186
It's a palace ball.
You'll need a nice dress.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.349
Okay. I'll see
what I have.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.261
I've seen your closet.
You don't have anything.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.796
Yeah. No food.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.424
No pretty dress either.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.330
What should I wear then?

09:54.561 --> 09:56.131
I have an idea.

10:06.539 --> 10:10.351
Why are you in such
 a hurry to find me a wife?

10:11.477 --> 10:13.081
If I don't,

10:13.346 --> 10:16.190
then you'll never become king.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.390
Why?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.064
When the time comes,

10:23.089 --> 10:25.160
you will know why.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.138
We were walking forever.

10:32.398 --> 10:36.244
Where is this hairy god-mother
 you were talking about?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.313
I said fairy god-mother,

10:38.338 --> 10:40.284
not hairy god-mother.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.577
What if she's hairy?

10:43.409 --> 10:45.184
Very funny!

10:45.912 --> 10:48.256
Will she really be
 able to help us?

10:48.548 --> 10:49.991
Of course!

10:50.016 --> 10:52.394
Everyone says she's great.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.967
Yummy food! 
ha-ha.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.974
That looks delicious.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.104
What?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.545
Guys, run!
Now!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.433
Who do we have here?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.168
I'm Ella.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.933
And these are my friends.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.627
Are you the hairy, fairy or cherry?

11:45.538 --> 11:46.547
Yeah!

11:46.572 --> 11:49.212
I's the fairy godmother's, um...

11:50.410 --> 11:52.390
..apprentice.

11:52.578 --> 11:55.189
- Apprentice?
- Yep.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.057
My name is Crystal.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.363
Where is the master magician?

11:59.919 --> 12:01.397
I don't know.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.330
Crystal, we need your
help to get a pretty dress.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.302
Why should I help you?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.137
You want a tailor..

12:09.162 --> 12:11.802
not a master magician.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.009
I bet she can't
even make a scarf.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.946
I don't know,
 maybe she can.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.075
You really think so?
Hmh.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.154
Wow! Nice!

12:34.487 --> 12:36.728
You see?
 It's easy.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.869
Crystal, right?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.264
How about me?
I want a suit ,too.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.099
Watch this. Hmh.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.379
Whoa! What--? urh!

12:55.200 --> 12:57.180
We got a perfect match!

12:58.030 --> 12:59.953
You two should dance
 with each other!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.391
Hey! Not funny guys!

13:03.416 --> 13:06.124
Dang it!
Can someone unzip this?

13:08.154 --> 13:09.931
Okay. I'm done now.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.496
Good bye.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.468
- Crystal?
- What?

13:14.360 --> 13:16.966
You forgot to make Ella a dress.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.069
No, I never promised you that.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.078
Let's just forget it.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.379
- Come on, let's leave.
- Wait.

13:28.574 --> 13:32.147
Do you know why we were looking for
 the fairy god-mother and not you?

13:32.211 --> 13:33.749
Why?

13:33.846 --> 13:36.190
Because everyone knows
how talented she is,

13:36.416 --> 13:38.896
but no one knows
how skilled you are.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.398
I know.
My teacher is famous.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.533
But...

13:43.556 --> 13:46.560
I bet you can be as well
 known as your teacher.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.232
How?

13:48.528 --> 13:51.998
By helping Ella become the most
 beautiful girl at the ball.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.143
And you really need me?

13:57.203 --> 13:58.213
Okay, then.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.274
Let me show you
 what I can do.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.247
First, you're going
to need a horse.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.291
Look at me!
I'm handsome.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.064
- Why are you so short?
- Hah?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.997
Let's try it on you.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.304
Do not mess 
with me again!

14:26.065 --> 14:27.474
So...

14:27.500 --> 14:29.138
What am I now?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.482
You look like a donkey.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.444
I hate donkeys!

14:39.479 --> 14:41.959
At least you're taller now.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.493
I'm sure it'll work this time.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.498
- Now we're both stallions!
- Much better looking than a donkey!

15:00.299 --> 15:02.245
Why didn't it work on you?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.014
It's so strange.

15:06.038 --> 15:08.248
Why are you still a mouse?

15:08.274 --> 15:09.714
No worries.

15:10.142 --> 15:11.883
I can fix this.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.420
Weird.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.890
Two horses are enough.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.160
Sure.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.963
Now it's your turn.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.161
The star of the night.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.900
Okay, let's do this.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.927
It's just a dress, right?

15:32.498 --> 15:34.569
- Wow!
 - Wow!

15:55.922 --> 15:58.129
Wow, it's beautiful!

16:04.030 --> 16:07.273
Now you're ready
for the royal ball.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.191
Am I dreaming?

16:25.051 --> 16:27.361
Let the dream begin.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.111
He's looking at me. Ha-ha.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.486
May I present..

18:32.511 --> 18:34.184
..miss Ella.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.885
Hah? Miss who?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.753
Ella.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.395
- I wonder, what's for dinner?
- hah?

19:14.420 --> 19:16.798
I can almost taste it.

19:16.822 --> 19:20.133
The roast potatoes, pudding ...

19:20.159 --> 19:21.467
Oh my!

19:26.132 --> 19:27.740
What's this?

19:32.938 --> 19:34.314
You are kidding me?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.217
I want a royal dinner!

19:36.242 --> 19:38.188
I'm going to the kitchen.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.018
I know where the kitchen is.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.054
Alright,guys!
 Let's go!

19:44.150 --> 19:47.063
It's so much easier as a mouse. Ah..

19:49.522 --> 19:52.526
You know, you're actually
 look good as a horse.

19:54.260 --> 19:57.002
I don't need compliments.
I want food.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.439
I could get you food.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.569
But, you'll owe me.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.874
Okay, whatever you want!
 I promise!

20:06.472 --> 20:08.149
I can't think of
anything right now,

20:08.174 --> 20:09.284
but I will.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.517
Okay,okay.
Just hurry!

20:17.583 --> 20:19.893
It feels good to be
 a  mouse again.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.990
So much better, hah?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.201
Wait, you're coming with us?

20:26.425 --> 20:28.928
Sure. I'd love to!

20:29.228 --> 20:30.935
But there will be guards.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.369
No problem!

20:40.372 --> 20:42.349
- Oh, amazing!
- Wow!

20:42.374 --> 20:43.910
Let's go!

20:48.113 --> 20:49.830
You are even shorter than me!

20:50.080 --> 20:51.286
Hilarious!

20:51.951 --> 20:54.090
You want to be
 a donkey again?

20:54.353 --> 20:56.560
No, that's okay.
I was just kidding.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.232
I don't want to be
a donkey again,

20:59.258 --> 21:00.532
not even a horse.

21:05.164 --> 21:08.543
I've never seen
a girl like you before.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.012
Now you have.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.946
Beautiful and interesting ...

21:12.972 --> 21:14.182
So...

21:14.206 --> 21:16.083
..how did you get here?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.213
A magician sent me here.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.254
And she has a sense of humor!

21:21.947 --> 21:23.858
My friends think so,too.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.994
Oh, do you like my palace?

21:27.019 --> 21:28.323
Not bad.

21:28.387 --> 21:31.298
Can I show you
my favorite place?

21:31.323 --> 21:32.859
Where is that?

21:33.859 --> 21:35.930
My beautiful garden.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.069
I'd prefer to see your kitchen.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.501
Kitchen?

21:41.267 --> 21:42.700
Are you hungry?

21:43.002 --> 21:44.845
Maybe my friends are.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.548
Wow! 
I love this style.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.520
Such nice decor.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.921
What's "decor"?

21:57.583 --> 21:59.494
It means "good taste".

21:59.518 --> 22:01.054
It tastes good?

22:01.287 --> 22:03.460
That's what I get for
 talking to peasants.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.994
Why are they so huge?

22:10.129 --> 22:12.006
These are knight's armour.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.440
Yeah,yeah.
 Whatever.

22:13.465 --> 22:14.876
I am a knight!

22:15.968 --> 22:17.413
So am I. Ha-ha.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.013
On guard!

22:20.039 --> 22:22.576
Hey ... I'm Sir Lancelot.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.516
Oh..not good.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.088
Someone's coming.
 Hide!

22:37.830 --> 22:39.967
What are you doing down here?

22:48.233 --> 22:49.871
There.
 Perfect.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.521
And nothing there.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.891
♪ To a boring job, I go again. ♪

23:03.916 --> 23:06.123
♪ life of a guard with ♪
♪ nothing to gain. ♪

23:07.886 --> 23:10.867
I almost lost my head!

23:14.093 --> 23:15.401
Your Highness.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.410
What are you looking at?

23:23.836 --> 23:24.906
Weird...

23:25.571 --> 23:28.211
But, it all looks familiar.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.552
Come on, I'm hungry.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.854
Let's go to the kitchen.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.516
All right.
This way.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.424
Wait.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.935
I sense dark magic.

23:57.503 --> 23:59.107
Dark magic?

24:00.372 --> 24:01.948
An evil magic,

24:01.974 --> 24:05.114
that only the meanest
 witches practice.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.054
That's impossible.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.786
We're in the palace.

24:15.354 --> 24:19.996
I can feel the dark magic,
behind this wall.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.214
- The wall swallowed her!
- M-hm.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.325
Guys, get in here!

24:44.349 --> 24:45.384
Quickly!

24:45.918 --> 24:49.058
Don't leave me here
 by myself, guys!

24:56.495 --> 24:58.099
Are you guys alright?Hah?

25:10.075 --> 25:12.385
Are we in the underworld?

25:12.478 --> 25:13.479
- Hey!
- Ah!

25:14.246 --> 25:16.089
Are you scared or something?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.189
It's over there.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.022
Now what?

25:24.823 --> 25:26.894
Something is wrong here.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.367
Look! Up there.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.090
- What is this place?
- It looks like a dungeon.

25:49.114 --> 25:52.220
Someone's practicing
dark magic here.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.116
Master, she's here.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.177
Are you sure?

26:18.944 --> 26:20.321
Yes, master.

26:20.345 --> 26:21.788
Excellent.

26:21.813 --> 26:24.190
She's right where we want her.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.527
We must capture her tonight..

26:26.552 --> 26:30.295
and stop her from
reversing the curse.

26:31.356 --> 26:34.132
Master, you believe
in that prophecy?

26:34.526 --> 26:36.102
Prophecy?

26:36.128 --> 26:37.805
We can't risk it.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.139
By getting rid of her

26:39.164 --> 26:40.840
the prophecy is meaningless,

26:40.866 --> 26:43.614
and that prince will stay
 a mouse forever!

26:43.614 --> 26:44.614
- Hah?
- Hah?

26:45.070 --> 26:46.079
Who's there?

26:46.104 --> 26:47.105
Run!

26:54.213 --> 26:56.591
Does this mean dinner's
 cancelled tonight?

26:56.750 --> 26:59.892
Are you kidding me?
We're the dinner now!

26:59.985 --> 27:00.986
Run!

27:35.554 --> 27:37.365
There they are.
 Catch them!

27:37.389 --> 27:39.130
- Yes, Your Majesty!
 - Yes, Your Majesty!

27:40.525 --> 27:41.868
Catch who?

27:42.027 --> 27:44.007
Those mice.

27:44.429 --> 27:45.505
Oh..right.

27:45.530 --> 27:46.531
The mice!

27:46.932 --> 27:47.933
This way!

27:49.268 --> 27:50.269
This way!

27:54.800 --> 27:56.683
Is that Ella?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.919
Wait, are you sure?

27:58.944 --> 28:00.321
No, that can't be her.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.382
She doesn't even
 have a dress.

28:02.914 --> 28:05.992
So, tell me about your family.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.521
I live with my step-mother
 and my step-sisters.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.292
Look, she smiled at us.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.392
Are they beautiful like you?

28:13.992 --> 28:15.502
Of course.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.768
That is Ella.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.903
How did all of this happen?

28:24.936 --> 28:25.937
Catch them!

28:27.906 --> 28:29.351
Those four mice!

28:34.179 --> 28:35.886
We have to find Ella.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.052
Giddy up!

28:38.116 --> 28:40.460
Hey, do you still
think I'm a horse?

28:40.485 --> 28:42.128
Just keep running!

28:42.154 --> 28:43.431
Are you sure?

28:43.455 --> 28:46.299
What are you saying?
The door is closed.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.034
You remember that--

28:48.360 --> 28:49.498
Trust me!

28:49.895 --> 28:52.034
I'm a horse! I'm a horse!
I'm a horse!

28:52.864 --> 28:55.276
I'm a horse!

29:05.243 --> 29:06.347
Ella!

29:13.185 --> 29:14.762
What is going on?

29:14.786 --> 29:16.424
I'll explain it later.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.795
After them!
Faster!

29:24.930 --> 29:27.103
Stop them!
Close the gate!

29:28.533 --> 29:30.443
The gate is closing!

29:30.469 --> 29:32.471
What do we gonna do?

29:34.172 --> 29:35.412
Well, let's go that way.

29:36.675 --> 29:38.586
Are you sure about that?!

29:40.078 --> 29:42.422
Halt! Don't go in there!

29:44.049 --> 29:46.791
They're heading towards the maze!
We'll catch them there!

29:46.885 --> 29:47.989
Turn left.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.163
That way.

30:08.073 --> 30:09.211
Who were they?

30:09.941 --> 30:12.581
The ones I've been searching for.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.454
The girl? Ella?

30:14.479 --> 30:15.924
Yes.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.094
And the mouse.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.862
But--But why don't you just
use your magic to stop them?

30:21.887 --> 30:24.165
If I use my dark magic,

30:24.189 --> 30:27.800
everybody will know
what I am, won't they?

30:31.229 --> 30:32.537
Follow them!

30:45.877 --> 30:47.151
What's happening?

30:47.245 --> 30:50.226
There was a witch inside
 the palace, chasing us!

30:50.482 --> 30:52.325
How can that possibly be?

30:52.610 --> 30:55.248
And that prince you
dance with, he is a fake.

30:55.253 --> 30:57.597
Then, where is
 the real prince?

30:59.157 --> 31:02.303
The real prince is a mouse.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.438
What?

31:03.462 --> 31:05.135
- Wha--?
- A mouse?

31:05.964 --> 31:09.207
I will host you in my palace.

31:10.936 --> 31:14.315
Can't you see I'm different than you?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.484
Oh, no.
Not you two.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.121
So..

31:22.147 --> 31:23.455
is it him?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.155
I remember something.

31:28.987 --> 31:29.996
But...

31:30.021 --> 31:31.564
I don't want to talk about it.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.866
Come on.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.370
What happened to you?

31:36.962 --> 31:38.270
When I was five,

31:39.364 --> 31:41.571
my father hired
 a tutor for me.

31:42.367 --> 31:43.869
She was lovely.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.412
And everyone liked her.

31:45.871 --> 31:47.441
She even taught me how to paint.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.848
One year later,

31:57.949 --> 31:59.360
I lost my parents.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.862
After that,

32:04.422 --> 32:06.129
my tutor changed.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.568
She wanted to take
over the kingdom.

32:13.899 --> 32:14.969
And then...

32:15.901 --> 32:19.041
I found out she was
 an evil enchanter.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.124
She used her magic

32:31.149 --> 32:33.186
to turn me into a mouse.

32:36.321 --> 32:39.131
And then, she erased
 all my memories.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.534
That's horrible.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.136
How could she do that?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.270
What a despicable nasty witch!

32:44.296 --> 32:45.940
Oh, god.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.309
I can't believe I've been
 living with a prince.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.037
How sad.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.278
Who is she?

32:54.406 --> 32:57.353
Her voice sounded
 a bit familier.

32:58.176 --> 32:59.886
You know magic, don't you?

32:59.911 --> 33:02.221
Why can't you
just undo the spell?

33:02.814 --> 33:06.059
Transforming a human
 requires powerful magic.

33:06.084 --> 33:07.692
Dark magic.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.498
What in the world?!

33:09.854 --> 33:11.364
I'm not at that level yet.

33:11.389 --> 33:15.030
That must be why I couldn't
change him into a horse.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.540
Then, what do we do now?

33:21.099 --> 33:24.273
I remember reading
 something about this.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.284
There is a ring

33:31.309 --> 33:33.419
that can break this black spell.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.049
In the Heartland!

33:35.113 --> 33:37.115
Well, then let's go there.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.018
But it's only a legend.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.827
We have to try.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.531
You'll have to
go on your own.

33:44.556 --> 33:45.967
I'm not going.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.567
This is his only chance to
turn back into a human.

33:51.496 --> 33:53.533
It's too dangerous.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.010
I can ask someone else.

33:57.936 --> 34:00.246
Why don't you listen to me?

34:00.839 --> 34:02.841
She's just afraid.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.380
- Afraid?
- Hah..

34:04.542 --> 34:05.952
Who said I was?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.979
If you not, prove it.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.783
I'll show you!

34:09.947 --> 34:11.859
Fine! Let's go,

34:11.882 --> 34:12.884
right Now!

34:13.851 --> 34:16.092
I knew you wouldn't leave us!

34:18.356 --> 34:21.063
I must have lost my mind.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.101
Okay, we're going.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.831
I don't want to go.

34:35.540 --> 34:38.077
So .... what's your name?

34:40.110 --> 34:42.284
I don't think mice
even have names.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.491
Come on!

34:44.516 --> 34:46.257
Everyone has a name.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.397
Alex.
My name was Alex.

34:51.222 --> 34:53.599
I knew something was
different about you.

34:53.650 --> 34:54.702
You're polite.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.202
You use a fork and knife.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.874
Oh, and you can dance ,too.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.476
But I'm still a mouse.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.906
We'll make you human again.

35:08.306 --> 35:10.149
I don't think that's possible.

35:11.209 --> 35:13.519
You'll never know
if you don't try.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.355
I'm no match against her.

35:20.251 --> 35:21.994
Alex, you're not alone.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.328
We'll help you.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.196
I don't want you guys
 to be in danger.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.573
I understand.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.808
I lost my parents,too.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.444
But together, we can
defeat the witch.

35:47.245 --> 35:49.919
You'd better leave before
they come and find me.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.027
We won't leave you.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.827
I don't need you!

35:56.154 --> 35:57.565
Please, just leave!

35:57.922 --> 35:59.560
I like being a mouse.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.967
Do you really want to live
 in the shadows forever?

36:09.334 --> 36:12.440
Or do you want to dance
 with me? As a human.

36:23.448 --> 36:25.459
Master, ther're heading
to the heartland.

36:25.483 --> 36:29.226
Oh, they must believe in
 that ridiculous legend.

36:29.954 --> 36:33.094
It's just another stupid
 old wives tale.

36:33.992 --> 36:36.302
But , what if they
find the ring?

36:37.529 --> 36:40.007
We can't let that happen.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.305
Take this.

36:42.066 --> 36:43.170
Follow them.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.409
Yes, master.

36:50.308 --> 36:51.285
Crystal?

36:51.309 --> 36:53.953
Are there any animals out here,

36:53.978 --> 36:56.652
specifically the ones
 that eat mice?

36:58.349 --> 37:00.026
Yeah, like cats?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.997
- I don't like cats.
- Ha-ha.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.522
Well..

37:04.122 --> 37:06.932
- ..there are fire dragons,
- Hah?

37:08.159 --> 37:10.436
iron lions ...

37:10.461 --> 37:12.964
- and ferrous monsters!
- Hah!

37:13.364 --> 37:14.434
But no!

37:16.534 --> 37:17.604
No cats.

37:19.304 --> 37:21.648
Perfect.
 No cats.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.446
I wonder what you'll look like
when you're a human?

37:28.446 --> 37:29.488
If I'm ugly,

37:29.514 --> 37:31.187
would you still be my friend?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.961
Maybe.
 Ha-ha.

37:35.553 --> 37:37.089
Then I don't want to go.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.368
I'm kidding!

37:42.393 --> 37:43.463
Come on!

37:45.063 --> 37:46.064
You!

37:52.971 --> 37:55.212
Wow! A berry.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.586
Don't touch my fruit.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.617
Who said that?

38:04.215 --> 38:08.288
Something weird always happens
when you're  picked fruit.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.426
Where are you?

38:14.892 --> 38:17.133
What are you doing here?

38:18.262 --> 38:19.434
Oh, we're..

38:19.664 --> 38:21.234
Just playing. ha-ha.

38:23.534 --> 38:25.036
Playing?

38:25.103 --> 38:26.514
All right.

38:26.904 --> 38:29.009
There're rules here.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.421
I can't believe there're
rules in the forest.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.659
"Rule 1:

38:37.248 --> 38:40.422
"don't touch any plants,

38:40.618 --> 38:45.533
 including flowers,
trees or herbs. "

38:46.958 --> 38:48.528
Really? Oh!

38:49.961 --> 38:51.605
"Rule 2:

38:51.629 --> 38:55.406
- No climbing on trees and rocks."
- Oh!

38:57.301 --> 38:59.247
"Rule 3:

38:59.570 --> 39:02.050
No littering".

39:04.242 --> 39:06.347
Does that count as littering?

39:09.080 --> 39:12.222
Not littering, per se,

39:12.617 --> 39:14.095
but..

39:14.218 --> 39:16.962
.. it does violate
rule number 20:

39:16.988 --> 39:20.094
" Don't pollute the environment."

39:22.293 --> 39:24.102
Where were we?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.467
Let's start all over again.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.309
"Rule 1:

39:28.900 --> 39:31.478
don't touch any plant. "

39:31.502 --> 39:34.574
"Including flowers,
 trees or herbs."

39:35.206 --> 39:36.682
We got it, thanks!

39:36.708 --> 39:38.178
Thank you!

39:38.910 --> 39:40.981
Where are you going?

39:45.249 --> 39:47.559
Who does that
turtle think he is!

39:47.618 --> 39:50.129
Yeah.. the boss of this place.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.997
Maybe he is.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.710
We have to get out of here!

40:13.444 --> 40:14.453
What is this?

40:14.479 --> 40:15.589
Whatever it is..

40:15.613 --> 40:17.388
just keep going!

40:18.416 --> 40:19.451
No way!

40:22.320 --> 40:24.425
Why is this happening to me?

40:31.296 --> 40:32.741
It's got me! Ah!

40:33.364 --> 40:34.942
Alex!

40:38.236 --> 40:40.273
Let him go! Ah!

40:42.440 --> 40:44.044
That will teach you!

40:53.351 --> 40:54.980
Keep running!

41:01.926 --> 41:03.035
We need to jump.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.972
Are you kidding me?

41:07.231 --> 41:09.040
I surrender!

41:17.008 --> 41:18.452
- Did you hear that?
 - What?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.887
Water!

41:25.483 --> 41:28.327
Help!
I can't swim!

41:52.276 --> 41:54.051
Is everyone okay?

41:54.479 --> 41:55.922
No, not really.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.358
- Was that a dragon?
 - No.

41:58.382 --> 42:00.092
It must be her!

42:00.118 --> 42:01.461
This is too dangeorus.

42:01.486 --> 42:02.988
We should go back.

42:03.387 --> 42:05.298
Great idea!
Let's go.

42:05.590 --> 42:07.297
He is right.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.338
We've come this far,
we can't give up now.

42:11.729 --> 42:15.074
We have no idea
where the ring is.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.537
I don't know if we could
survive the next danger.

42:22.507 --> 42:25.579
You really need to see this!

43:15.026 --> 43:16.903
Amazing!

43:32.443 --> 43:33.478
You see?

43:33.710 --> 43:35.181
The ring.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.226
It's not just a legend.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.962
What genius put
 the ring up there?

43:42.987 --> 43:45.058
Can anybody fly?

44:01.172 --> 44:02.845
Be careful,Ella.

44:03.341 --> 44:04.843
I will.

44:07.311 --> 44:09.382
She's really flying.

45:05.836 --> 45:07.406
What is going on?

45:10.074 --> 45:12.111
Oh, I can't get it!

45:12.210 --> 45:14.212
Well, what does it feel like?

45:14.578 --> 45:15.921
Nothing.

45:15.946 --> 45:18.051
But we can see it.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.026
Come on!

45:25.389 --> 45:27.335
What's wrong with it?

45:27.992 --> 45:30.029
This is giving me
a headache! Oh!

45:32.997 --> 45:34.107
Crystal!

45:34.131 --> 45:36.111
Why can't I get the ring?

45:38.369 --> 45:40.007
I don't know!

45:42.940 --> 45:44.950
I only know what's in the book.

45:44.975 --> 45:47.453
I guess the legend was wrong.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.288
After all that?

45:49.313 --> 45:51.987
Are you telling us
 it's not real?

45:57.154 --> 45:58.394
Sorry.

45:59.023 --> 46:00.798
You all tried your best.

46:00.958 --> 46:03.234
Maybe, this is my fate.

46:03.561 --> 46:05.939
Alex, don't lose hope.

46:05.996 --> 46:07.202
It's all right.

46:07.398 --> 46:10.971
I'll search forever, untill you
 become a human again.

46:12.103 --> 46:15.516
That was really moving.

46:16.073 --> 46:17.149
I knew it!

46:17.174 --> 46:18.417
You set us up!

46:18.442 --> 46:20.183
What do you want from us?

46:20.378 --> 46:22.051
I've been here...

46:22.346 --> 46:24.123
...for hundreds of years.

46:24.148 --> 46:27.826
And I've seen so many people
 that come for the ring..

46:27.852 --> 46:30.530
filled with their own desires.

46:30.554 --> 46:32.932
They all leave with nothing.

46:33.057 --> 46:35.230
They come for themselves.

46:36.026 --> 46:40.406
But you are the only one
 who is here for others.

46:40.931 --> 46:42.842
Do you know
where the ring is?

46:43.267 --> 46:45.444
It's right here.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.312
But I can't get it.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.348
If it was easy,

46:49.373 --> 46:51.444
then anyone could get it.

46:53.944 --> 46:55.988
I'm so foolish!

46:56.013 --> 46:58.892
He is the guardian of the ring!

46:58.983 --> 47:00.794
What's a guardian?

47:00.818 --> 47:03.799
That means he really is
the boss of this place.

47:46.363 --> 47:49.208
My mission is now complete.

47:49.233 --> 47:50.507
Good luck.

48:31.208 --> 48:32.386
Alex...

48:32.476 --> 48:33.477
..here.

48:49.827 --> 48:50.862
Alex!

48:55.099 --> 48:57.110
- Let's chase them!
- Crystal!

48:57.134 --> 48:58.545
Go to the entrance!

49:01.138 --> 49:03.448
You can't escape from here!

49:03.774 --> 49:06.015
Keep dreaming, mouse boy!

49:08.345 --> 49:10.055
Oh, no!
What do we do?

49:10.080 --> 49:11.356
Let's get to the high ground!

49:11.382 --> 49:12.792
Go away!

49:12.816 --> 49:13.851
Never!

49:16.053 --> 49:17.828
Let go of me!

49:18.088 --> 49:19.260
Give me the ring!

50:30.880 --> 50:32.198
Not good.

50:40.304 --> 50:41.874
You did it!

50:42.539 --> 50:45.076
- I can't believe my eyes!
- Wow!

50:45.909 --> 50:47.479
Hello, my friends.

50:47.578 --> 50:50.247
Look at your clothes.
You really are a prince.

50:50.271 --> 50:52.881
M-hm.
You're really handsome.

50:53.384 --> 50:56.422
Thank you for taking care
 of me for so long.

50:56.520 --> 50:59.865
From now on it's my turn
to take care of you.

51:02.326 --> 51:03.498
Perfect!

51:03.827 --> 51:05.103
Thank you, Crystal.

51:05.129 --> 51:07.166
We wouldn't be here,
without you.

51:07.264 --> 51:08.540
Don't thank me.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.067
Thank her.

51:14.371 --> 51:15.372
Ella.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.109

Don't you want to go
 back to the palace

53:48.258 --> 53:50.431
so you can get your life back?

53:51.028 --> 53:52.939
There's nothing for me there.

53:54.264 --> 53:56.938
I don't even know
who I was back then.

53:59.036 --> 54:01.141
You are the real prince.

54:01.205 --> 54:02.377
I know that.

54:03.106 --> 54:04.584
But...

54:06.243 --> 54:09.254
You're worried she will turn
 you into a mouse again.

54:09.279 --> 54:10.288
Yes.

54:10.314 --> 54:11.793
I'm terrified.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.860
I have everything I need now.

54:17.120 --> 54:19.066
I want to start my new life.

54:21.124 --> 54:22.133
So...

54:22.159 --> 54:23.297
What's your plan?

54:24.895 --> 54:27.569
I want to go somewhere where
they will never find us.

54:28.065 --> 54:29.339
Will you come with me?

54:34.004 --> 54:36.883
And I will work hard
to give you a great life.

54:37.908 --> 54:39.114
But...

54:39.276 --> 54:40.949
You don't know anything.

54:45.249 --> 54:46.259
It's fine.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.292
Don't worry.

54:47.317 --> 54:48.853
I can teach you.

54:49.152 --> 54:50.195
Does that mean..

54:50.220 --> 54:51.221
yes?

54:51.355 --> 54:52.561
No.

54:55.158 --> 54:57.863
Yes.
I'll go with you.

54:58.528 --> 54:59.871
That's great!

55:05.802 --> 55:07.281
But I have to go home

55:07.838 --> 55:09.943
and get something
 before we leave.

55:10.240 --> 55:12.447
Of course, your music box.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.421
Yes.

55:16.413 --> 55:19.121
That is the only thing
 my father left me.

55:19.883 --> 55:21.521
I'll go and get it for you.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.161
No.

55:23.186 --> 55:24.563
They're looking for you.

55:25.422 --> 55:27.368
Don't worry.
 I'll come back.

55:29.192 --> 55:30.764
Be careful.

55:34.898 --> 55:36.036
Is that real?

55:36.967 --> 55:38.037
Yes.

55:38.368 --> 55:41.315
That mouse turned
back into a human.

55:42.105 --> 55:44.278
This is bad news.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.889
We have to do something.

55:51.081 --> 55:52.424
Of course.

55:52.582 --> 55:55.563
There's one thing
you have to do now.

55:57.921 --> 56:00.367
Wait my signal , you'll see.

56:02.225 --> 56:03.435
Step-mother.

56:03.460 --> 56:04.803
Ella!

56:04.828 --> 56:07.172
Thank goodness, you're home.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.809
I have good news for you.

56:09.833 --> 56:12.939
I've met someone and
 I'm going away with him.

56:13.236 --> 56:16.381
Oh! I'm so 
happy for you.

56:16.406 --> 56:18.545
And we'll miss you.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.044
Thanks, I'll miss you too.

56:21.945 --> 56:23.788
I'm going to start packing.

56:28.218 --> 56:30.824
All those years of collecting..

56:32.089 --> 56:34.296
- I have collected a bit, too.
- Hah?

56:34.891 --> 56:36.370
Oh, you're modest.

56:37.127 --> 56:37.755
- Oh!
- Ha?

56:37.779 --> 56:39.779
Get your hands off me!

56:41.598 --> 56:43.077
Let me go!

56:45.168 --> 56:46.178
Ella!

56:46.203 --> 56:48.149
We need to get Alex.
Hurry!

56:52.275 --> 56:55.085
I'm glad you're
starting a new life.

56:56.013 --> 56:56.989
Yeah.

56:57.014 --> 56:59.255
I've never been
 so happy before.

57:01.118 --> 57:02.825
So, what's your plan?

57:03.320 --> 57:05.926
I want to keep searching
 for my mentor.

57:06.189 --> 57:08.362
I'm sure you'll become
 a great magician.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.166
Just like the fairy god-mother.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.305
You have to write to me.

57:13.397 --> 57:15.377
And I can come visit you.

57:16.466 --> 57:17.475
Of course.

57:17.501 --> 57:18.946
You're our friend.

57:21.938 --> 57:22.916
Ella...

57:24.174 --> 57:25.950
Captured! Guards!

57:25.976 --> 57:29.014
Ella has been captured
by the royal guards!

57:29.546 --> 57:30.547
No!

57:32.082 --> 57:33.058
Wait!

57:33.083 --> 57:34.259
Where are you going?

57:34.284 --> 57:35.854
I'm going to save her.

57:37.187 --> 57:39.224
You know it's a trap.

57:40.891 --> 57:42.167
You are a fool!

57:42.192 --> 57:44.536
You'll never get out alive!

57:45.095 --> 57:46.438
I have to go!

57:51.501 --> 57:52.510
Fine!

57:52.536 --> 57:54.311
Be a hero!

57:56.573 --> 57:58.314
I am done!

57:58.442 --> 58:01.150
I am really done this time!

58:06.450 --> 58:08.191
What do we do now?

58:08.518 --> 58:09.861
You tell me.

58:10.787 --> 58:12.164
Let's follow him.

58:45.188 --> 58:49.227
Well, well, well.
Look who we have here.

58:49.993 --> 58:51.336
Where's Ella?

58:51.461 --> 58:54.374
Where she is,
 is not important.

58:54.931 --> 58:57.878
What's important is
 that you are here.

58:58.235 --> 58:59.845
You can keep everything here.

58:59.870 --> 59:01.406
Just let Ella go!

59:01.872 --> 59:03.916
They're all mine!

59:03.940 --> 59:05.419
Including Ella.

59:07.978 --> 59:10.322
Then prepare to
 lose everything.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.986
You think you can
 defeat me?

59:13.216 --> 59:15.253
Who do you think you are?

59:15.919 --> 59:17.830
I am the rightful prince!

59:17.854 --> 59:19.527
You are nothing
 but a fraud!

59:22.893 --> 59:24.170
Stop lying!

59:24.194 --> 59:25.969
No one believes you!

59:32.002 --> 59:33.212
What are you looking at?

59:33.236 --> 59:35.238
I'm trying to see
 if we can help.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.982
Do you think we can?

59:37.007 --> 59:38.418
- No, not really.
- Hah?

59:46.917 --> 59:47.895
You...

59:48.919 --> 59:50.921
You filthy mouse!

59:52.656 --> 59:53.726
Hit again.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.208
Ella, where are you?

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.245
Ella?

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:06.303
Ella?

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.515
Worry about yourself first!

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.377
Eat that!

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:35.203
- Why are we running?
 - We're going to find Ella.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.209
A dog!

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:40.447
Let's run!!

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.491
Let's see if you can dodge this!

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.028
Don't touch it!

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.271
Keep the crown.

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:12.547
Just tell me where Ella is!

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:15.182
You will never find her!

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:19.112
You're going down.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.256
Any last words for Ella?

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:23.956
I'll be sure to pass
 them along to her.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:42.200
So close.
I'm saved again.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:13.965
Wait!
That's not fair.

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.343
Where's Ella?

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.282
I--I'll tell you.

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:28.122
Ella...she..

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.348
She is...

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.856
She is going down.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.484
- Just like....
- Ah!

01:02:33.508 --> 01:02:35.508
-...you!
- Ah!!

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:49.266
I can't believe Alex got defeated.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.880
I win again.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.511
You should've
stayed a mouse.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.817
Ella is not even in the palace.

01:03:04.047 --> 01:03:05.424
You are lying!

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:08.156
You think you're a prince.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.934
You are nothing.

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:14.896
And when you die,

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:17.235
you will be remembered
 as a mouse,

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.830
not a prince.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.531
Alex?

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.732
Ella!

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:48.159
This is a trap.
Get out of here!

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:50.937
Don't be afraid.
We'll be all right.

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.051
Look out!

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:23.501
Sorry, I'm late.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:27.565
I didn't expect you to
 defeat Olaf so quickly.

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:29.908
You don't care
about your son?

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:33.311
He's not my son.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:36.977
I just brought some entitled
 brat to replace you.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.584
How could you be so cruel?

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:45.590
Let Ella go.
Take me instead!

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.993
Another romantic story.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:51.123
Too bad, you're not that hero.

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:53.096
You're insane!

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.534
This ends now!

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:57.469
Do you want to be
 a mouse again?

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.178
You twisted despicable witch!

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.782
Did you hear me,
you old woman?

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:11.842
Shut up!

01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:27.065
Alex, run!

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.899
You can't beat her!

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.940
I'm coming!

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.136
Go save the Ella.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:41.948
Crystal?

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.853
Take that!

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.326
Impressive.

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.496
Are you alright?

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:01.763
Enough!

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:10.142
Are you okay?

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.776
Thanks for coming for us.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.281
I was getting
bored without you.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.519
Crystal...

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.229
God-mother!

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.163
Fairy God-mother?

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:33.895
She is your teacher?

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.569
She's the Fairy God-mother?

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:38.194
What?

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.368
What a surprise 
to see you here.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.578
But...I--

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:46.911
I don't understand!

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.479
I'll explain later.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:50.347
Now come to me.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.418
Wait!

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.918
Why did you abandon me?

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:57.221
The kingdom was corrupt
and I went to save it.

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.556
To save the kingdom?!

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:01.061
By turning Alex
into a mouse?

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.763
That was just 
a small accident.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.832
I don't know
what he told you,

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.098
but you have to believe me.

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:12.870
I can't trust you anymore!

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:15.068
You taught me to be good,

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.144
but look what you've done!

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.143
So...

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.205
you want to defy me?

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:24.016
Just let them leave.

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.178
Absolutely not!

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:30.379
I can't believe 
you're so ruthless!

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.897
Oh my...

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:43.063
Is that anyway to talk
 to your teacher?!

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.351
What should we do?
What should we do?

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:08.060
We need a plan!

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:12.958
No time for a plan!
 Let's go!

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.068
Hey!

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.761
Attack!

01:08:16.785 --> 01:08:18.185
Hah?

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.216
I hate mice!
Ah!

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.555
We have to 
get out of here.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.923
Hurry!

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.560
No!

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:57.471
Get out, you filthy mice!

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:11.484
No!

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.095
Watch out!

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.109
Crystal!

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:42.821
Are you okay?

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.188
No!

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.034
Why?

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.408
Ella!

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.878
Oh, no!

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.440
Ella!

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:14.985
You can fly,

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:16.821
You can cast magic spells ...

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:18.985
you can bring Ella back , right?

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:21.553
There is nothing I can do.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.224
I'm so sorry.

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.512
Unless...

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.919
What? 
Unless what?

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.313
The ring.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.852
It can save Ella.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.886
Really?

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:52.792
But...

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:55.469
but you'd turn back
into a mouse,

01:10:55.738 --> 01:10:56.738
forever.

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.229
I don't want to be
a mouse again.

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.073
But if I'm a mouse,

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:51.482
at least we can
be together.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.246
Alex?

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:01.077
Alex?

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.114
Crystal?

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:04.788
Alex?

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:06.054
Where is Alex?

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:09.895
Where is he?

01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:24.039
How did this happen?

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.937
Oh, Alex.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.148
Alex?

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:39.917
What happened?

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:43.953
He gave you the ring,

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.893
to save her.

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:51.871
No.

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:54.370
It can't be!

01:14:00.403 --> 01:14:01.413
Well..

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.542
then it will be just like
 it was before,

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:04.807
right?

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:08.852
But this way..

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:10.323
we can stay together.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:27.374
- Are we in heaven?
- Whoa!

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:29.841
If this is heaven,
 it isn't very pretty!

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:31.276
Crystal! Ella!

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:39.417
Alex?

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:40.944
What happened?

01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:44.152
That the witch turned
 you back into a mouse?

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:48.326
Unfortunately,
 it is what it is.

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:51.024
I guess you guys will have to
share your food with me again.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.433
It hurts my heart to
 share food with you.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.365
But don't worry, Ella,

01:14:56.459 --> 01:14:58.837
I'll take good care of him.

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:01.203
Thank you.

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:02.973
Great!

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.441
We're back to
where we started.

01:15:04.467 --> 01:15:06.469
All that trouble for nothing!

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:08.780
But now,

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:12.479
I can tell people I'm best
friends with a real prince.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.521
Faster, you ugly beasts!

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.998
The prince will never
let us get away!

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:30.492
Who would've thought a mouse
would turn out to be a prince?

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.540
I can't believe it..

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:39.978
Things will never be
 the same, I just know it.

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:42.549
I have to keep fit.

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.085
I have to keep fit!

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:47.049
I have to keep--

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:51.515
Stop tempting me!

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.871
Maybe I'll exercise later.

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:08.202
After I finish this cake!

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.208
We need to fix here .

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.843
Road in here.

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:15.109
And extend here.

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.478
All these places need
to be taken care of.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.847
Are you sure, sir?

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.253
Of course.

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:25.290
As a proffesional sewege designer,

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:28.318
I've been there six times
 already this morning.

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.163
Guess what I've got?

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.299
I don't know.

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:45.176
My music box!

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.511
I thought I'd never
 never see this again.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:49.815
Thank you.

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.542
It's my pleasure.

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.585
But I can't help
you with anything.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:16:59.123
Don't worry.

01:16:59.148 --> 01:17:01.287
At least I had
a wonderful moment!

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.096
I found it!

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.365
- You found what?
- Found what?

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:11.768
There is another way

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:13.398
to break the spell.

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:16.240
The answer is in this book.

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:25.549
As you can see,

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:28.085
life is not always perfect.

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.418
But it is full of hope.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:32.090
A new adventure awaits us.

01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:37.060
And the story of cinderella
 will be told forevermore.

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:49.163
