00:16.412 --> 00:18.280
Male announcer:
Villainy swells!

00:18.314 --> 00:21.082
With an army of the galaxy's
most vicious criminals,

00:21.116 --> 00:23.417
Darth Maul and Savage Opress

00:23.451 --> 00:26.253
conspire with Pre Vizsla
and the Death Watch

00:26.287 --> 00:29.756
to topple Duchess Satine,
ruler of Mandalore.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.791
While the conspirators prepare to attack

00:31.825 --> 00:33.860
the Mandalorian capital of Sundari

00:33.894 --> 00:35.528
from a base on Zanbar,

00:35.562 --> 00:39.365
the fate of 2,000 other neutral
systems is under threat

00:39.399 --> 00:42.201
as Darth Maul moves closer
to establishing

00:42.236 --> 00:44.671
a vast criminal empire.

00:44.705 --> 00:46.673
Where are my targets?

00:46.708 --> 00:48.942
We've identified them
at these locations.

00:48.977 --> 00:50.911
However, as I've said before,

00:50.946 --> 00:53.781
if we try to take Mandalore by force,

00:53.816 --> 00:56.584
our people will turn against us.

00:56.618 --> 00:58.753
I will use

00:58.787 --> 01:00.989
my army of crime lords

01:01.023 --> 01:03.658
to attack different targets
across Sundari

01:03.692 --> 01:07.795
and sow chaos to undermine
the Duchess' rule.

01:07.830 --> 01:13.201
Our gangsters will make her look
too weak to maintain control.

01:13.236 --> 01:16.304
Then you and your Death Watch
will capture and arrest us,

01:16.338 --> 01:20.575
bringing order where Satine's
weak government could not.

01:20.610 --> 01:22.577
We'll be saviors.

01:22.612 --> 01:24.413
Exactly.

01:24.447 --> 01:26.014
A good plan.

01:26.049 --> 01:27.015
Indeed.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.717
I'll prepare the troops.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

01:37.393 --> 01:40.128
It's a risk to trust those monsters.

01:40.162 --> 01:42.363
How do we know they'll keep
their end of the bargain?

01:42.398 --> 01:44.132
We need those Sith and their thugs

01:44.166 --> 01:47.135
to cause some pain and show
the Mandalorian people

01:47.169 --> 01:49.303
how weak Satine really is.

01:49.338 --> 01:50.705
After this is done,

01:50.739 --> 01:53.374
no one will doubt why we're in power.

01:53.408 --> 01:55.176
Most will welcome us.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.377
Then what?

01:56.411 --> 01:59.046
Then we execute Maul and those thugs.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.416
Those criminals will scatter,
and Mandalore will be ours.

02:07.489 --> 02:10.890
I believe Vizsla will betray us.

02:10.925 --> 02:13.260
We have no other choice.

02:13.294 --> 02:14.761
We cannot rule openly

02:14.796 --> 02:17.464
without drawing the attention
of the Jedi.

02:17.498 --> 02:20.934
We need Vizsla as the face of our rule

02:20.968 --> 02:22.068
for now.

02:22.102 --> 02:23.803
The promise of wealth

02:23.837 --> 02:26.305
will find us a new face on Mandalore.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.642
You have learned well, my apprentice.

02:29.676 --> 02:33.178
Greed never fails to motivate.

02:36.049 --> 02:39.051
[engines whirring]

02:54.000 --> 02:57.001
[machine hums]

02:58.971 --> 03:00.271
What's the matter?

03:00.306 --> 03:02.440
I am scanning life forms.

03:02.475 --> 03:05.610
I believe this spice shipment
is infested.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.479
Step back.

03:07.513 --> 03:09.347
[doors clatters open]
Ah!

03:09.382 --> 03:10.382
Gangsters!

03:10.416 --> 03:12.584
We're under attack.

03:12.618 --> 03:13.618
[grunts]

03:16.355 --> 03:17.322
Surrender.

03:17.356 --> 03:19.858
My Master is taking over these docks.

03:19.892 --> 03:23.395
You are now under the control
of the Pyke Syndicate.

03:26.633 --> 03:29.435
Duchess, the shipping docks
are under attack.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.404
By whom?
The Death Watch?

03:31.438 --> 03:34.440
No, it appears to be a crime syndicate.

03:34.474 --> 03:37.009
Our guards are helpless
against their numbers,

03:37.044 --> 03:40.613
and the people are demanding
we do something to stop them.

03:43.584 --> 03:45.218
Welcome to Mandalore.

03:45.252 --> 03:46.719
[blaster fires]

03:46.754 --> 03:48.388
[gasps]

03:48.422 --> 03:49.723
Stand down.

03:49.757 --> 03:52.892
You are now all slaves
of the Black Sun Clan.

03:52.926 --> 03:54.060
[people screaming]

03:54.094 --> 03:55.728
[blasters firing]

03:55.762 --> 03:57.029
Fall back!

04:01.935 --> 04:02.969
It's the gangsters.

04:03.003 --> 04:04.204
Lock the vaults.

04:04.238 --> 04:05.772
Open the bank.

04:05.806 --> 04:08.041
We're here for a withdrawal.

04:08.075 --> 04:09.275
Guards, now.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.810
[doors whir open]

04:14.148 --> 04:16.183
The Black Sun is attacking the vaults.

04:16.216 --> 04:17.885
Send reinforcements.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.321
[laughs evilly]

04:23.793 --> 04:25.427
[lightsaber hums]

04:25.461 --> 04:27.362
[growls]

04:27.397 --> 04:28.664
Take him.

04:28.698 --> 04:30.065
[blasters firing]

04:30.099 --> 04:32.067
[grunts]

04:33.670 --> 04:36.672
[officers groaning]

04:40.044 --> 04:42.012
[crowd grumbling]

04:42.046 --> 04:44.747
I need you all to remain calm.

04:44.782 --> 04:47.450
These attackers are just thugs

04:47.485 --> 04:50.019
brought on by the lowest element.

04:50.054 --> 04:51.187
[crowd grumbles]

04:51.221 --> 04:54.223
The Duchess Satine has led us to ruin.

04:56.492 --> 04:58.360
Death Watch.

04:58.394 --> 05:00.028
Guards, stay back.

05:00.062 --> 05:04.198
Vizsla, you must be the one
responsible for these attacks.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.200
No, I'm not responsible.

05:06.235 --> 05:08.736
But I can offer a solution.

05:11.706 --> 05:13.707
People of Mandalore...

05:15.610 --> 05:18.846
I am Pre Vizsla of clan Vizsla.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.514
Death Watch is here to save you

05:20.549 --> 05:22.350
from these intergalactic gangsters

05:22.384 --> 05:24.352
that threaten our great city.

05:24.386 --> 05:26.087
This is a war,

05:26.121 --> 05:27.922
and we will win.

05:27.956 --> 05:30.959
[crowd cheers]

05:33.729 --> 05:38.199
Join me and let us defend
Mandalore against the criminals.

05:38.234 --> 05:41.202
We need action, not pacifism.

05:41.237 --> 05:43.371
Do not listen to him!

05:43.405 --> 05:47.409
His war will cause the end
of Mandalore as we know it.

05:47.443 --> 05:49.411
We are under attack.

05:49.445 --> 05:52.013
There is no time for discussion.

05:52.048 --> 05:55.049
[crowd cheers]

05:57.820 --> 06:00.488
The name Mandalore should send fear

06:00.522 --> 06:04.159
into the hearts of these gangsters.

06:04.193 --> 06:05.660
[crowd shouting] It's war!

06:05.695 --> 06:06.995
It's war!

06:07.029 --> 06:09.498
Vizsla! Vizsla!

06:09.532 --> 06:10.866
War!

06:10.900 --> 06:13.902
[crowd continues shouting]

06:28.969 --> 06:31.436
The people are beginning to follow you.

06:31.471 --> 06:35.073
It is time for Death Watch
to take action.

06:35.108 --> 06:37.843
Make sure you put on a good show.

06:37.877 --> 06:40.646
As you wish, Lord Maul.

06:52.692 --> 06:55.827
[doors clatter shut]

06:55.861 --> 06:57.329
What should we do?

06:57.363 --> 06:58.997
There's nothing we can do.

06:59.031 --> 07:01.365
The Duchess' forces are being overrun

07:01.400 --> 07:03.334
across the entire planet.

07:03.369 --> 07:05.003
[blasters firing]
Listen.

07:05.037 --> 07:08.673
It sounds like there is fighting
going on out there.

07:08.707 --> 07:09.707
Ah!

07:11.744 --> 07:13.111
What's going on?

07:13.146 --> 07:14.146
We're Death Watch,

07:14.180 --> 07:16.147
and we're here to rescue you.

07:16.182 --> 07:18.016
You have my thanks, soldier.

07:18.050 --> 07:20.819
No, thank Pre Vizsla.

07:22.921 --> 07:25.923
[blasters firing]

07:39.004 --> 07:42.006
[ropes swishing]

07:56.886 --> 07:58.720
You're safe now.

08:00.322 --> 08:01.690
[whispers] It's the Death Watch.

08:01.724 --> 08:03.058
The Death Watch are our saviors.

08:03.092 --> 08:04.259
- They saved us.
- They freed us.

08:04.293 --> 08:05.293
Our saviors.

08:05.328 --> 08:06.828
The Death Watch saved us.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.267
Stop them!
They've robbed the main vault.

08:12.301 --> 08:13.802
[blasters fire, officers groan]

08:17.473 --> 08:18.439
[remote beeps]

08:18.474 --> 08:20.809
[loud explosion]

08:22.045 --> 08:24.313
Keep up, you weaklings.

08:24.347 --> 08:25.381
Ugh.

08:25.415 --> 08:26.649
[screams]

08:26.684 --> 08:27.684
[gasps]

08:29.854 --> 08:31.654
[gasping]

08:31.689 --> 08:33.690
[sobs]

08:37.128 --> 08:40.130
[lightsabers humming]

08:44.503 --> 08:46.237
This monster will not trouble

08:46.271 --> 08:48.840
the people of Mandalore any longer.

08:48.874 --> 08:50.942
Take him away, Captain.

08:53.979 --> 08:55.045
[crowd chanting] Vizsla!

08:55.080 --> 08:56.213
Vizsla!

08:56.248 --> 08:58.482
Vizsla! Vizsla!

09:01.652 --> 09:05.288
Duchess, Pre Vizsla and his
men have entered the palace.

09:05.322 --> 09:06.456
Should we stop them?

09:06.490 --> 09:07.957
How can we?

09:07.991 --> 09:10.192
The people are on their side now.

09:10.227 --> 09:13.362
[crowd chanting distantly]
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

09:13.396 --> 09:16.532
[dramatic instrumental music]

09:16.566 --> 09:17.600
No!

09:17.634 --> 09:20.035
There will be no bloodshed.

09:20.070 --> 09:21.370
But, Duchess--

09:21.405 --> 09:25.241
- I will not be provoked
to violence by these terrorists.

09:25.275 --> 09:26.743
Listen, Duchess.

09:26.777 --> 09:28.411
Do you hear the people?

09:28.446 --> 09:30.914
They cry out for change.

09:30.949 --> 09:34.418
Your weak-minded rule
of Mandalore is at an end.

09:34.453 --> 09:37.421
The resurrection of our warrior past

09:37.456 --> 09:40.090
is about to begin.

09:47.298 --> 09:50.166
Duchess Satine
and the New Mandalorian leaders

09:50.201 --> 09:52.168
have fled in cowardice

09:52.203 --> 09:55.738
while the Death Watch brought
these criminals to justice.

09:55.773 --> 09:58.574
Your new Prime Minister, Pre Vizsla,

09:58.609 --> 10:00.409
leader of Death Watch,

10:00.444 --> 10:02.578
exiled governor of Concordia,

10:02.612 --> 10:04.813
true son of Mandalore,

10:04.848 --> 10:06.248
presents you with the lords

10:06.282 --> 10:09.250
of the most feared crime
families in the galaxy.

10:09.285 --> 10:10.251
[crowd chants] Vizsla!

10:10.285 --> 10:12.386
Vizsla! Vizsla!

10:12.421 --> 10:16.223
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

10:16.258 --> 10:17.758
Vizsla!

10:22.898 --> 10:25.367
You cannot hold me here.

10:25.401 --> 10:27.703
I am the Duchess of Mandalore.

10:27.738 --> 10:30.873
Your actions will bring
our civilization to ruin.

10:30.908 --> 10:32.676
Is that you, Satine?

10:32.710 --> 10:33.944
Almec?

10:33.978 --> 10:35.579
Here for a visit,

10:35.613 --> 10:38.348
or has peace betrayed you too, Duchess?

10:38.383 --> 10:41.618
Peace exists only in the minds
of the faithful.

10:41.653 --> 10:45.355
And faith has been
the greatest disappointment.

10:45.389 --> 10:47.524
Only when it is broken.

10:47.558 --> 10:50.360
What you did for the people
as Prime Minister

10:50.395 --> 10:52.329
betrayed their trust.

10:52.363 --> 10:53.831
And you betrayed mine.

10:53.865 --> 10:56.501
Destitution leaves little room
for faith.

10:56.535 --> 11:00.038
My actions allowed the people
hope in your leadership.

11:00.072 --> 11:03.775
The supplies I bought on the
black market kept you in power.

11:03.809 --> 11:06.477
Another error of judgment.

11:06.512 --> 11:10.180
The people made willing
sacrifices for their freedom.

11:10.215 --> 11:12.349
Corruption is not the answer.

11:12.383 --> 11:14.284
[laughs]

11:14.318 --> 11:16.686
Then enjoy your freedom, Duchess.

11:16.720 --> 11:20.189
You'll have plenty of time
to tell me all about it.

11:28.799 --> 11:31.568
The transition of power
will be seamless.

11:31.602 --> 11:33.303
We now have the support of the people

11:33.337 --> 11:35.472
and Satine to bait Kenobi.

11:35.506 --> 11:38.475
With his demise,
our deal will be complete.

11:38.509 --> 11:40.978
Your oversight requires correction.

11:41.012 --> 11:44.148
We now have a base, an army,

11:44.182 --> 11:48.052
and the means to expand
to other neutral systems.

11:48.087 --> 11:50.121
It wasn't an oversight.

11:50.156 --> 11:51.690
It was intentional.

11:51.724 --> 11:54.526
I don't have an interest
in the other systems.

11:54.561 --> 11:56.896
Your vision no longer matters.

12:00.033 --> 12:01.033
[cuffs click]

12:03.636 --> 12:04.770
Oh, don't fret.

12:04.804 --> 12:06.505
I'll still honor our deal.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.374
Kenobi will be dealt with.

12:08.408 --> 12:11.944
But now you'll do as I say.

12:14.814 --> 12:17.116
The violence is over!

12:17.150 --> 12:20.118
The last of the parasites
infecting Mandalore

12:20.153 --> 12:21.786
has been caught.

12:21.821 --> 12:23.955
The Duchess has abandoned her duty

12:23.989 --> 12:25.790
to protect Mandalore.

12:25.824 --> 12:28.659
Her political dream
only encourages aggression

12:28.693 --> 12:29.827
against our planet.

12:29.861 --> 12:31.162
[grunts]

12:31.196 --> 12:32.930
We have learned from this beast

12:32.964 --> 12:36.267
the consequences of pacifist principles.

12:36.301 --> 12:40.804
It's now time to restore
the traditions of Mandalore.

12:40.838 --> 12:43.807
No one will ever threaten us again!

12:43.841 --> 12:46.309
[crowd chanting]
Vizsla! Vizsla!

12:46.344 --> 12:49.613
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

12:59.848 --> 13:03.150
Vizsla has captured
the support of his people,

13:03.185 --> 13:04.652
just as we planned.

13:04.686 --> 13:08.256
However, he is not
their anointed leader yet.

13:08.290 --> 13:10.091
There is still time for us

13:10.125 --> 13:13.995
to put in place a leader
under our control.

13:14.029 --> 13:16.497
Then let us escape,
and we shall find one.

13:16.531 --> 13:18.165
Patience.

13:18.199 --> 13:20.100
We must move cautiously.

13:20.134 --> 13:21.735
By placing us in prison,

13:21.769 --> 13:24.571
Vizsla has unwittingly put us in reach

13:24.605 --> 13:27.873
of several candidates for his successor.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.676
Who do you mean, brother?

13:30.710 --> 13:34.346
Vizsla has imprisoned the Duchess here.

13:34.380 --> 13:38.183
Other political advisors of hers
will be within these walls

13:38.217 --> 13:41.186
who will suit our purposes well.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.589
Hey, quiet, you two.

13:43.623 --> 13:47.861
Apprentice,
I wish a tour of this facility.

13:50.465 --> 13:51.431
[glass shatters]

13:51.466 --> 13:52.432
Ah!

13:52.466 --> 13:53.467
zap!

14:02.644 --> 14:03.811
crash!

14:13.488 --> 14:16.690
You are the now the former
Duchess Satine,

14:16.724 --> 14:18.758
are you not?

14:18.793 --> 14:21.594
What do you want, you monster?

14:21.629 --> 14:22.796
Mm, nothing yet,

14:22.830 --> 14:25.131
but I will have a use for you in time.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.067
Where are the other leaders
of your people?

14:28.102 --> 14:30.069
You should know already.

14:30.104 --> 14:32.238
They've either sided with Vizsla

14:32.273 --> 14:33.907
or have been killed.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.810
There's no one left now but Almec and I,

14:36.844 --> 14:39.612
but he's as corrupt and vile as you.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.880
Really?

14:40.914 --> 14:41.947
Hmm.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.750
Thank you for being so cooperative.

14:53.325 --> 14:54.792
Almec?

14:54.827 --> 14:56.527
Yes?

14:56.562 --> 14:59.197
I can deliver you from this prison.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.867
What was your position
in this government?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.503
I am the former Prime Minister.

15:04.537 --> 15:08.107
Satine imprisoned me on charges
of corruption and conspiracy

15:08.141 --> 15:10.944
for using the black market.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.545
He's a murderer.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.715
He caused the death of children.

15:14.749 --> 15:15.783
Quiet.

15:15.817 --> 15:16.817
[blaster fires]

15:18.186 --> 15:21.188
[gasping and choking]

15:23.625 --> 15:25.726
What do you want from me?

15:25.760 --> 15:29.629
Mandalore is in need
of a Prime Minister.

15:29.664 --> 15:32.365
I thought you were in league
with Pre Vizsla.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.366
[gasping]

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
crack!

15:36.870 --> 15:38.871
We were.

15:38.906 --> 15:40.540
Clearly you are powerful,

15:40.574 --> 15:44.310
but how can two of you overthrow
Vizsla and his supporters?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.646
Vizsla is a soldier,

15:46.680 --> 15:48.081
and like every soldier,

15:48.115 --> 15:50.583
he is bound by honor.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.518
I will challenge him to single combat

15:52.553 --> 15:53.686
in front of his men.

15:53.721 --> 15:56.489
He will not deny me.

15:56.524 --> 15:57.490
Hmm.

15:57.525 --> 15:58.691
If you defeat him,

15:58.726 --> 16:01.528
according to the ancient laws
of Mandalore,

16:01.562 --> 16:04.898
his soldiers will be honor-bound
to follow you.

16:04.932 --> 16:06.767
Precisely.

16:10.104 --> 16:11.738
Sir, they're attacking.

16:11.772 --> 16:14.774
[choking]

16:25.218 --> 16:27.186
I challenge you,

16:27.220 --> 16:29.355
one warrior to another.

16:29.389 --> 16:33.559
And only the strongest
shall rule Mandalore.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.898
So be it.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.934
Give him his weapon.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.641
[growls]

16:50.644 --> 16:52.312
For Mandalore!

16:53.781 --> 16:56.783
[lightsabers humming]

17:01.088 --> 17:02.555
[grunts]

17:04.391 --> 17:07.393
[blaster fires]

17:17.070 --> 17:18.405
Ah!

17:23.145 --> 17:24.512
[loud explosion]

17:24.546 --> 17:27.114
[explosion]

17:27.148 --> 17:28.816
[growls]

17:31.053 --> 17:32.453
[loud explosion]

17:38.628 --> 17:40.929
[grunting]

17:48.037 --> 17:50.038
[laughs]

17:50.072 --> 17:51.273
[growls]

18:01.083 --> 18:04.085
[lightsabers humming]

18:19.634 --> 18:21.635
[yells]

18:28.676 --> 18:30.344
[rope swishes]

18:33.247 --> 18:35.482
[yells]

18:36.584 --> 18:39.786
[punching and smacking]

18:39.821 --> 18:41.221
crack!
[gasps]

18:43.925 --> 18:46.928
[groaning]

18:48.297 --> 18:49.364
[growls]

18:53.603 --> 18:55.504
[groans]

18:57.273 --> 18:58.273
Ah!

18:59.275 --> 19:01.109
Oh.

19:09.986 --> 19:12.053
Like you said,

19:12.088 --> 19:14.455
only the strongest

19:14.490 --> 19:17.258
shall rule.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.360
[yells]

19:22.130 --> 19:24.764
I claim this sword

19:24.799 --> 19:27.767
and my rightful place as leader

19:27.802 --> 19:29.970
of Death Watch.

19:33.407 --> 19:34.541
Never.

19:34.575 --> 19:36.909
No outsider will ever rule Mandalore.

19:36.944 --> 19:38.177
Hmm.

19:38.212 --> 19:40.046
If you will not join me,

19:40.080 --> 19:42.649
you will all die.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.319
You're all traitors.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.654
Unfortunately for you,

19:48.689 --> 19:51.156
history will not see it that way.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.758
Execute them!

19:53.960 --> 19:57.029
[blasters firing]

19:57.063 --> 20:00.065
[loud explosions]

20:21.522 --> 20:22.488
[crowd muttering]

20:22.523 --> 20:25.825
Silence, please, silence.

20:25.860 --> 20:28.128
Hear me now.

20:28.162 --> 20:29.796
Duchess Satine,

20:29.831 --> 20:32.967
the so-called pacifist,

20:33.001 --> 20:36.637
who could not protect you
when your lives were at stake,

20:36.671 --> 20:39.140
has murdered Pre Vizsla,

20:39.174 --> 20:41.442
the true hero of Mandalore.

20:41.476 --> 20:44.444
Satine is now under arrest,

20:44.478 --> 20:46.980
and it was Pre Vizsla's last command

20:47.014 --> 20:50.983
that I be reinstated as Prime Minister.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.285
I know my past is checkered,

20:53.319 --> 20:54.954
but I promise you,

20:54.988 --> 20:57.556
I take full responsibility
for my people.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.760
And my heart now bleeds for your pain.

21:01.795 --> 21:04.597
However, from this point on,

21:04.631 --> 21:07.266
Mandalore will be strong,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.603
and we will be known as the warriors

21:10.638 --> 21:13.206
we were always meant to be.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.242
[crowd cheering and chanting]

21:26.754 --> 21:29.857
You have done well, Prime Minister.

21:29.891 --> 21:33.727
I shall waste no time
in building my administration.

21:33.761 --> 21:35.728
Choose wisely.

21:35.763 --> 21:39.599
I will hold you personally
responsible for their failures.

21:41.068 --> 21:43.036
Yes, Master.

21:43.070 --> 21:46.373
Is there anything more you require?

21:46.407 --> 21:48.375
Go.

21:48.409 --> 21:51.244
Rule my people.

21:53.653 --> 22:04.146
