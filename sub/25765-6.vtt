WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:01.928
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

00:01.930 --> 00:03.864
I actually have the number of a shrink.

00:03.866 --> 00:04.865
I'm already seeing someone.

00:04.867 --> 00:07.534
I decide what he deserves.

00:07.536 --> 00:09.369
I will get my law license back.

00:09.371 --> 00:11.605
My partner and I will get a new office.

00:11.607 --> 00:13.607
I have tons of Mesa Verde to catch up on.

00:13.609 --> 00:15.633
You have work. I have work.

00:15.635 --> 00:16.725
It's all good.

00:16.727 --> 00:17.907
I don't know what to tell you, Paige.

00:17.909 --> 00:19.138
I'm sorry.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.581
It'll never happen again.

00:20.583 --> 00:21.599
It's impossible?

00:21.624 --> 00:23.491
Difficult. Not quite impossible.

00:25.195 --> 00:26.160
Give me your money.

00:26.863 --> 00:27.962
Back in the day,

00:27.964 --> 00:29.630
they would have known not to roll me.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.342 --> 00:40.742
Here you go.

00:45.382 --> 00:48.216
Are you sure about these?
The pool's up to $200.

00:48.218 --> 00:50.017
I've made my choices.

00:50.019 --> 00:51.552
Well... Confidence.

00:51.554 --> 00:53.745
An admirable trait.

00:54.758 --> 00:55.857
Clara.

00:55.859 --> 00:57.158
Hey, Jimmy.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.693
- What do you got for me?
- I'm stuck

00:58.695 --> 01:00.228
on Documentary Short Subject.

01:00.230 --> 01:03.331
Mm. Yeah. Just go with your gut.

01:08.738 --> 01:10.838
"Howards End" all the way down, huh?

01:10.840 --> 01:13.007
I just love Emma Thompson.

01:13.009 --> 01:14.008
Who doesn't?

01:14.010 --> 01:15.610
She's so pragmatic.

01:15.612 --> 01:17.478
Yeah, well, fingers crossed.

01:21.518 --> 01:22.950
Hey, hey. Hey.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.118
How'd we do?

01:24.120 --> 01:26.854
This is everything from two.

01:26.856 --> 01:28.890
And I even got Chloe to throw in.

01:28.892 --> 01:31.959
Many have tried to argue with Kim Wexler.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.394
All have failed.

01:33.396 --> 01:35.897
I'm headed up to four. You got anything?

01:35.899 --> 01:36.964
Yep.

01:38.535 --> 01:39.867
And I'll do three.

01:39.869 --> 01:41.251
Already done.

01:41.905 --> 01:44.405
You know, you're making
the rest of us look bad.

01:45.642 --> 01:47.975
If you wouldn't stop
at every cubicle to chat...

01:47.977 --> 01:49.610
It's called being friendly.

01:49.612 --> 01:50.878
It's great for morale.

01:50.880 --> 01:53.147
It is great for wasting time.

01:53.149 --> 01:54.782
- That, too.
- Okay.

01:54.784 --> 01:56.284
It's... So, discovery for Cordero

01:56.286 --> 01:57.585
is coming this afternoon,

01:57.587 --> 01:59.387
so you might want to kick it up a bit.

02:02.892 --> 02:04.258
Wow.

02:04.260 --> 02:05.493
- Congratulations.
- He really did it.

02:05.495 --> 02:07.094
What? Isaacson.

02:07.884 --> 02:09.997
- The case.
- I don't...

02:09.999 --> 02:12.233
Isaacson vs. Vakarian Holdings, Inc.

02:12.235 --> 02:15.269
We've been assembling binders for months.

02:15.271 --> 02:17.738
I've been kind of slammed
with the Oscar pool,

02:17.740 --> 02:19.407
in case you weren't paying attention.

02:19.409 --> 02:21.142
Right. Sorry. I'll try harder.

02:21.144 --> 02:25.413
So, this guy, Isaacson...
he dies of a heart attack.

02:25.415 --> 02:27.481
- Mm-hmm.
- And his family they're our clients...

02:27.483 --> 02:28.816
sort through his financials, you know,

02:28.818 --> 02:30.151
looking to track down his assets.

02:30.153 --> 02:33.521
Lo and behold, they find some old shares

02:33.523 --> 02:37.592
in this company he invested in
like 20 years back.

02:37.594 --> 02:40.828
Family tracks down the CFO,
looking to cash out,

02:40.830 --> 02:42.763
but he tells them, "Hmm,

02:42.765 --> 02:44.765
that corporation's been dissolved."

02:44.767 --> 02:46.868
Isaacson's shares are worthless.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.002
- Whoa.
- Right?

02:48.004 --> 02:49.504
But Chuck does some digging,

02:49.506 --> 02:51.672
and it turns out
they formed a new corporation

02:51.674 --> 02:53.274
that's virtually identical

02:53.276 --> 02:55.042
to the old corp Isaacson invested in.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.612
It's the same officers,
same structure, everything.

02:57.614 --> 02:59.180
- Ah.
- Right?

02:59.182 --> 03:03.150
So, Chuck finds exemption 4
in Leannais vs. Cincinnati,

03:03.152 --> 03:04.518
- which is compl...
- Okay. Okay. Yeah, listen.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.987
I appreciate the effort,

03:05.989 --> 03:08.189
but can you just big-picture it for me?

03:08.191 --> 03:09.657
I am.

03:09.659 --> 03:10.958
Chuck won a case

03:10.960 --> 03:12.827
that Howard thought was unwinnable

03:12.829 --> 03:16.297
using only the power of obscure case law.

03:16.299 --> 03:19.367
That's... good.

03:19.369 --> 03:20.726
Yeah, very.

03:21.852 --> 03:24.205
Congratulations, Mr. McGill.

03:24.207 --> 03:25.740
- Jimmy.
- Chuck.

03:25.742 --> 03:27.041
- Big day, huh?
- Yeah.

03:27.043 --> 03:28.309
Thanks, uh...

03:28.311 --> 03:29.744
- Kim. Wexler.
- Of course.

03:29.746 --> 03:31.178
- You're one of our law students?
- Yes.

03:31.180 --> 03:32.513
- I'm in my third year at UNM...
- Ah.

03:32.515 --> 03:33.881
...thanks to HHM.

03:33.883 --> 03:36.317
- How's it going?
- Very well. Thank you.

03:37.587 --> 03:39.086
And congratulations again on Isaacson.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.354
Well...

03:40.356 --> 03:41.589
I'm sure that you considered it.

03:41.591 --> 03:43.057
I just wanted to ask.

03:43.059 --> 03:44.859
Vakarian Holdings, Inc.,
would have been liable

03:44.861 --> 03:46.560
under the "continuing
enterprise" exception,

03:46.562 --> 03:47.762
- as well, right?
- That's right.

03:47.764 --> 03:49.730
Yeah, we looked into that.

03:49.732 --> 03:51.365
What was the case law on that?

03:51.367 --> 03:54.235
- Uh, Garcia vs. Coe Manufacturing.
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.237 --> 03:56.270
Sounds like it was Isaacson v. Chuck

03:56.272 --> 03:58.506
handing him his butt on a platter, huh?

03:58.508 --> 04:01.509
Well, yeah, but Isaacson is our client.

04:01.511 --> 04:02.743
Oh, really? Okay.

04:02.745 --> 04:05.046
Well, the... the other guys' butts, then.

04:05.048 --> 04:07.615
Yeah, served on platters.
That's right. Thanks, Jimmy.

04:09.052 --> 04:10.718
Hail the conquering hero.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.587
Thanks, Howard.

04:12.589 --> 04:14.255
I hate to interrupt,

04:14.257 --> 04:16.390
but there's a "Mr. Bushmills"
waiting in my office.

04:16.392 --> 04:17.625
Mmm.

04:17.627 --> 04:19.226
Kim. Jimmy.

04:21.898 --> 04:24.432
Congratulations.

04:26.269 --> 04:27.751
That'll be you soon.

04:28.571 --> 04:30.338
Yep.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.075
Kay. See ya later, Jimmy.

04:34.077 --> 04:36.043
See ya.

04:45.475 --> 04:47.488
Ben, what you got for me?

04:47.490 --> 04:48.823
There's your winner.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.094
You think Pacino's gonna "hoo-ah" his way

04:53.096 --> 04:55.237
to Oscar glory, huh?

04:59.068 --> 05:00.601
Last call for ballots.

05:48.885 --> 05:56.921
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:04.213 --> 06:06.967
With respect to the zoning committee,

06:06.992 --> 06:08.992
we maintain that the Mesa Verde statue

06:08.994 --> 06:12.062
should be exempt
from sign code restrictions

06:12.064 --> 06:15.999
on size and location

06:16.001 --> 06:19.969
because it is a work of art.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.415
Specifically, its function extends

06:32.417 --> 06:35.952
beyond furthering the company's
economic interests,

06:35.954 --> 06:37.954
which distinguishes it
from commercial speech

06:37.956 --> 06:40.890
under legal precedent.

06:40.892 --> 06:43.460
Um, Viola, can you look up

06:43.462 --> 06:45.680
the relevant case law here for me?

07:00.912 --> 07:05.867
I'm, uh... I think it is maybe...

07:07.652 --> 07:10.320
uh, U.S. v. United Foods.

07:11.957 --> 07:13.208
Yeah.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.482
Good morning.

08:14.553 --> 08:17.020
Jimmy. Morning!

08:17.022 --> 08:18.454
Oh. Good morning.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.657
I'm just... just making the O.J.

08:20.659 --> 08:22.058
I see that.

08:30.035 --> 08:32.287
I didn't hear you come to bed.

08:33.071 --> 08:35.837
I was up late
justifying a giant horse statue

08:35.840 --> 08:37.472
to the Park City zoning commission.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.208
How big we talking?

08:39.211 --> 08:41.910
"I'm definitely overcompensating
for some other shortcoming" big.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.801
Your hours pretty much set now?

08:46.803 --> 08:47.919
Yeah.

08:47.921 --> 08:50.486
Weekdays 9:00 to 4:00, the busy time.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.681
Oh, yeah?

08:52.641 --> 08:53.890
It's dead, Kim.

08:53.892 --> 08:55.558
It's deader than disco.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.978
Mm. Sorry.

08:58.096 --> 08:59.395
Does that mean you were able to schedule

08:59.397 --> 09:01.191
an appointment with the therapist?

09:05.937 --> 09:08.671
I decided not to go.

09:11.409 --> 09:13.109
Oh.

09:14.713 --> 09:18.147
Um... okay.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.621
I thought you already decided to go.

09:24.623 --> 09:27.523
I know, and I did.

09:27.525 --> 09:33.696
But then I... time went by,
and I kind of calmed down

09:33.698 --> 09:37.227
and realized it's just...
it's just not for me.

09:38.236 --> 09:39.437
Why not?

09:40.639 --> 09:42.038
It's just not.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.442
I don't think that navel-gazing

09:46.444 --> 09:48.211
is gonna get me where I need to be.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.479
Yeah, but how do you know...

09:49.481 --> 09:51.080
Unless I try?

09:51.082 --> 09:53.116
It just doesn't feel right.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.418
I need to be moving forward, you know?

09:55.420 --> 09:58.388
And now I got this job,
and I'm kind of on a path.

09:58.390 --> 10:02.992
And, uh Just wanna give this a try.

10:02.994 --> 10:04.421
Is that okay?

10:05.463 --> 10:07.090
Sure.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.802
Yeah. Of course, Jimmy.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.222
Yeah. Listen, I know you wanted me to go.

10:15.006 --> 10:16.975
You have to do what's best for you.

10:21.813 --> 10:24.647
Oof. Uh, I should go open up.

10:24.649 --> 10:29.279
Um... sushi tonight?

10:29.654 --> 10:31.781
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

10:54.212 --> 10:55.722
Kim.

10:56.715 --> 10:57.880
Hello, Rich.

10:57.882 --> 10:59.315
- So good to see you.
- You too.

10:59.317 --> 11:00.983
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

11:00.985 --> 11:02.385
Oh, are you kidding?

11:02.387 --> 11:03.498
I've been wanting to thank you in person

11:03.500 --> 11:05.154
ever since you sent
Billy Gatwood our way.

11:05.156 --> 11:06.556
So, shall we?

11:06.983 --> 11:08.825
So, how long you got with that thing?

11:08.827 --> 11:10.159
- Three more weeks.
- Mm.

11:10.161 --> 11:12.628
Can I sign it? Do people still do that?

11:13.998 --> 11:15.498
Please have a seat. Have a seat.

11:16.901 --> 11:18.534
I won't lie.

11:18.536 --> 11:21.204
Losing Billy Gatwood definitely hurt.

11:21.206 --> 11:22.371
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

11:22.373 --> 11:23.917
I think he misses you.

11:24.376 --> 11:26.376
As long as he's taken care of, I'm happy.

11:26.378 --> 11:27.910
Well, you made it easy for us.

11:27.912 --> 11:30.046
We just continued what you started.

11:31.249 --> 11:33.850
So, um, how is James holding up?

11:33.852 --> 11:36.554
I didn't get to speak with him
at the funeral.

11:37.589 --> 11:39.389
We're taking it one day at a time.

11:39.391 --> 11:40.823
Mm.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.426
Well, grief moves at its own pace.

11:43.428 --> 11:46.262
And it's different for everybody, so...

11:46.264 --> 11:48.064
Give him my best.

11:48.066 --> 11:49.399
Thank you.

11:49.401 --> 11:51.300
So, what can I do for you?

11:52.737 --> 11:55.104
- I have a question for you.
- Mm-hmm.

11:55.106 --> 11:57.740
How's your banking division?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.109
Well, we have some banking work,

12:00.111 --> 12:02.278
but I wouldn't say we have a division.

12:03.615 --> 12:05.124
Would you like one?

12:19.264 --> 12:23.533
Well, it's a good long way
from the rest of your operation.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.728
It must remain completely separate.

12:26.938 --> 12:28.857
Two bedrooms each.

12:29.741 --> 12:31.607
Werner'll probably take his own,

12:31.609 --> 12:34.143
and the rest of the guys can double up.

12:34.145 --> 12:36.145
Wired and plumbed?

12:36.147 --> 12:37.365
Yes.

12:37.949 --> 12:39.951
Oh, this is a good start.

12:41.152 --> 12:43.119
What do you have in mind?

12:43.121 --> 12:46.289
Hmm.

12:47.992 --> 12:52.128
Couple treadmills over there,
barbells, weight bench.

12:52.130 --> 12:54.497
You build out a stocked bar, beer on tap.

12:54.499 --> 12:56.593
I mean, they're German, so...

12:57.235 --> 13:00.770
Entertainment system here, DVD player.

13:00.772 --> 13:03.239
Projector and screen set-up
might be nice,

13:03.241 --> 13:06.275
a few La-Z-Boys or couches, pool table.

13:06.277 --> 13:08.077
I don't know. Foosball?

13:08.079 --> 13:09.912
Hell, we could even put up a hoop.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.848
Germans play basketball, yeah?

13:11.850 --> 13:13.401
I believe so.

13:14.408 --> 13:17.486
You know, Werner said that
this was gonna take 6 months,

13:17.488 --> 13:21.424
which means 8 at least,
probably 10, in total isolation.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.260
These guys are gonna be doing
10 hours heavy labor

13:24.262 --> 13:26.262
every day... well, night.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.097
Then coming home to this.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.665
We can't just keep 'em alive.

13:29.667 --> 13:32.535
We got to keep 'em
from climbing the walls.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.475
Make a list.

13:40.712 --> 13:44.140
Security.

13:45.316 --> 13:48.317
I'd like a full camera perimeter inside,

13:48.319 --> 13:49.852
and we'll keep it low-profile.

13:49.854 --> 13:51.073
They'll know we'll be watching.

13:51.075 --> 13:53.623
We just don't need
to stick it in their faces.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.725
Outside, too, obviously,

13:55.727 --> 13:59.428
in case someone tries
to find a way in or out.

14:03.568 --> 14:05.801
I'll put a sally port on that door.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.038
We'll control it from the outside.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.251
And we're gonna need a trailer
to monitor the cameras.

14:13.011 --> 14:14.671
Close by.

14:15.079 --> 14:19.008
2 guys, 24-hour monitoring,
working shifts.

14:19.550 --> 14:22.852
Let's say 5 guys, minimum.

14:22.854 --> 14:25.755
Probably help to have a couple
German speakers, as well.

14:25.757 --> 14:27.690
I can provide you men.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.055
Well, I'm gonna need to vet 'em.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.383
- No offense.
- Of course.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.501
- What is it?
- Infection. Bad one.

14:41.906 --> 14:43.673
I must leave.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.442
Tell Tyrus what you need.
It will be done.

14:51.783 --> 14:54.216
You got a pen?

14:54.218 --> 14:56.252
- I'll remember.
- Yeah?

14:57.555 --> 14:58.921
Treadmills.

14:58.923 --> 15:00.623
You want to check wholesale providers.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.960
These guys are gonna tear
right through consumer-grade.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.630
I'd love to see what something,

15:07.631 --> 15:11.702
say, like a 24-footer, would run me.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.000
Salesperson on phone: Uh, sorry.

15:13.002 --> 15:14.235
We just don't make them that big.

15:14.237 --> 15:15.703
Who does?

15:15.705 --> 15:18.172
- I can't think of anyone around here.
- Yeah.

15:18.174 --> 15:21.409
Well, who makes those huge signs
that the casinos have?

15:21.411 --> 15:23.110
Um...

15:23.112 --> 15:25.780
You know what? Never mind.
Thank you very much.

15:29.519 --> 15:30.952
Jimmy McGill.

15:30.954 --> 15:32.887
Uh, yes. I'm looking for Jimmy McGill.

15:32.889 --> 15:35.189
Yeah. You found him.

15:35.191 --> 15:36.753
The lawyer?

15:37.260 --> 15:39.727
Yeah. Wh... What can I do for you?

15:39.729 --> 15:41.062
My name is Brett Dunst.

15:41.064 --> 15:42.964
I think you did my aunt's will?

15:42.966 --> 15:44.865
At least, that's what it says here.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.567
She, um... She died.

15:46.569 --> 15:49.303
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thanks.

15:49.305 --> 15:51.572
I'm the executor,
and I distributed all her stuff,

15:51.574 --> 15:53.774
but there's some kind
of finer details in this thing

15:53.776 --> 15:55.242
that are real tricky.

15:55.244 --> 15:56.444
I thought maybe you could
help me with those.

15:56.446 --> 15:59.113
Who was your aunt?

15:59.115 --> 16:01.027
Geraldine Strauss.

16:01.818 --> 16:03.985
Oh, Mrs. Strauss passed away?

16:03.987 --> 16:05.619
H-How?

16:05.621 --> 16:08.723
She, um... She went in her sleep
a couple weeks ago.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.491
Heart failure.

16:10.493 --> 16:12.259
Oh.

16:13.963 --> 16:17.231
- Hello?
- Um...

16:17.233 --> 16:21.469
Did Clarence get the Alpine Shepherd Boy?

16:21.471 --> 16:22.965
I'm sorry?

16:23.506 --> 16:25.940
Uh, the Hummel.

16:25.942 --> 16:29.138
Oh, the little figure.
Yeah, yeah, he got it.

16:29.579 --> 16:32.847
So, uh, he finished college then?

16:32.849 --> 16:35.316
Yep. Just this last semester.

16:35.318 --> 16:38.252
Well, good. That's... That's good.

16:38.254 --> 16:39.487
How did you kno...

16:39.489 --> 16:42.110
Oh, because you did the will. Right.

16:43.359 --> 16:45.960
Is there a memorial?

16:45.962 --> 16:48.282
Uh, sorry. It was last week.

16:49.198 --> 16:51.165
Anyway, it's my busiest time at work,

16:51.167 --> 16:52.767
and Angie's doing the best she can,

16:52.769 --> 16:55.136
but I have to get back to Salt Lake.

16:55.138 --> 16:56.604
Are you on an hourly rate,

16:56.606 --> 16:59.640
or would this be, like,
a flat-fee kind of thing?

17:03.312 --> 17:05.174
Mr. McGill?

17:06.049 --> 17:08.182
I'm sorry. I, uh...

17:09.178 --> 17:13.186
I'm not practicing any longer.

17:13.189 --> 17:14.622
Aw, darn it.

17:16.058 --> 17:17.625
I can refer you, though.

17:17.627 --> 17:22.363
Um... Hamlin Hamlin McGill

17:22.365 --> 17:25.398
has an excellent estate law department,

17:25.401 --> 17:26.834
and they'll help you sort things out.

17:26.836 --> 17:29.570
Just ask for Francis Scheff,

17:29.572 --> 17:31.672
and he'll point you
in the right direction.

17:31.674 --> 17:34.408
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

17:34.410 --> 17:37.044
McGill. Wait. Isn't that you?

17:37.046 --> 17:40.648
Uh, it's just a coincidence.

17:40.650 --> 17:43.184
All right. Well, thank you, Mr. McGill.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.352
You bet.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.023
God damn it.

18:04.540 --> 18:08.109
My husband and I
scrimped and saved for so many years.

18:08.111 --> 18:10.111
We did our best to build a nest egg

18:10.113 --> 18:13.347
so that we wouldn't
be a burden to our family.

18:13.349 --> 18:17.218
After Ronald passed, I moved
to an assisted-living facility,

18:17.220 --> 18:18.953
a nice place.

18:18.955 --> 18:21.255
They told me they'd take care
of everything,

18:21.257 --> 18:25.126
but then one day, they said
all my money was gone.

18:25.128 --> 18:27.561
How could that be?

18:27.563 --> 18:29.897
Where did it all go?

18:29.899 --> 18:31.365
If you or a loved one is a resident

18:31.367 --> 18:33.634
of a Sandpiper Crossing facility...

18:33.636 --> 18:34.928
...or other associated

18:34.953 --> 18:36.137
retirement community,

18:36.139 --> 18:39.106
you may be eligible to receive
compensation for...

18:42.211 --> 18:43.377
Hey there.

18:43.379 --> 18:44.745
Hey.

18:44.747 --> 18:46.380
Guess where I am.

18:46.382 --> 18:47.948
Somewhere good?

18:47.950 --> 18:50.417
Somewhere very good.

18:50.419 --> 18:52.419
You could be here, too.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.109
Hey there.

19:15.111 --> 19:17.511
Hey... Giselle.

19:18.614 --> 19:19.980
I was thinking

19:19.982 --> 19:21.615
we could just be Kim and Jimmy today.

19:21.617 --> 19:24.084
Ah. Okay.

19:24.086 --> 19:25.586
Those two aren't all bad.

19:26.023 --> 19:27.588
Rumors and hearsay.

19:27.590 --> 19:28.923
How's work?

19:30.126 --> 19:31.959
It is a job.

19:31.961 --> 19:34.695
And how about you? Work's good?

19:34.697 --> 19:37.498
Yeah. Actually, I have news.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.966
Good news.

19:38.968 --> 19:40.701
It's great news, really.

19:40.703 --> 19:44.371
It could change things for Wexler/McGill.

19:44.373 --> 19:47.975
But I met with Rich Schweikart today.

19:47.977 --> 19:50.002
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:50.004 --> 19:51.512
Well, you know, they took on Gatwood,

19:51.514 --> 19:53.347
so I've been meaning to follow up.

19:53.349 --> 19:56.283
And ahh anyway, we were talking,

19:56.285 --> 19:58.719
and he offered me a job.

19:58.721 --> 20:00.387
Again?

20:00.389 --> 20:03.190
What? He can't take no for an answer?

20:03.192 --> 20:06.327
They want me to run
their banking division.

20:06.329 --> 20:08.232
Build it, really.

20:08.664 --> 20:11.065
You're not seriously considering it?

20:11.527 --> 20:14.030
I'd be coming in as a partner.

20:14.537 --> 20:16.237
But I thought things were going okay

20:16.239 --> 20:18.472
with Mesa Verde since, uh...

20:18.474 --> 20:20.202
They are. They were.

20:20.810 --> 20:24.545
My workload has gotten
a lot more complicated lately.

20:24.547 --> 20:27.381
I've been taking on some pro bono work,

20:27.383 --> 20:29.250
overflow from
the public defender's office.

20:29.252 --> 20:33.320
P.D. overflow? When did you... Why?

20:36.993 --> 20:38.492
I like it.

20:39.829 --> 20:41.265
I'm good at it.

20:41.764 --> 20:46.400
And I'm helping people, Jimmy.

20:46.402 --> 20:48.035
And I know that sounds cheesy.

20:48.037 --> 20:50.904
It's, you know, it's whatever,
but it's the truth.

20:50.906 --> 20:54.842
No. It, uh, makes a lot of sense.

20:58.447 --> 21:02.216
I have been thinking about
criminal law myself lately

21:02.218 --> 21:06.020
you know, for when I get my license back.

21:06.457 --> 21:08.055
Really?

21:08.057 --> 21:09.356
Yeah.

21:09.358 --> 21:10.624
You know, like you said,

21:10.626 --> 21:12.452
you know, you're helping people.

21:14.897 --> 21:16.697
I'm thinking an office

21:16.699 --> 21:18.599
in one of these refurbished bungalows,

21:18.601 --> 21:20.300
you know, downtown by the courts,

21:20.302 --> 21:23.237
you know, stick around where all
the people who need help are.

21:23.239 --> 21:25.539
Boy.

21:25.541 --> 21:30.524
It has a nice ring to it now...
"Wexler/McGill... criminal law."

21:32.481 --> 21:34.376
That all sounds great.

21:36.585 --> 21:37.947
The thing is,

21:38.654 --> 21:41.622
if I go to Schweikart and Cokely,

21:41.624 --> 21:44.892
I have all those associates
to help cover Mesa Verde.

21:45.788 --> 21:47.795
It'll keep paying the bills

21:47.797 --> 21:50.898
and free me up to do
the work I really care about.

21:54.937 --> 21:58.272
So, you kind of get to have
your cake and eat it, too.

21:59.260 --> 22:01.220
Kind of, yeah.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.616
I'll be right back.

22:09.618 --> 22:11.018
- No. Jimmy.
- What?

22:11.020 --> 22:13.732
I... No, I just... I got to hit the head.

22:48.991 --> 22:50.769
I say do it.

22:51.327 --> 22:54.962
It's a great opportunity,
and you should jump on it.

22:56.699 --> 22:57.831
You mean that?

22:57.833 --> 22:59.333
Yeah.

22:59.335 --> 23:01.530
Kim, you got to do what's best for you.

23:02.304 --> 23:03.532
You sure?

23:04.840 --> 23:06.673
Yes.

23:06.675 --> 23:09.079
I can't ask you to wait around for me.

23:10.079 --> 23:11.578
And who knows?

23:11.580 --> 23:14.648
10 months, a lot can happen.

23:14.650 --> 23:15.883
Yeah.

23:15.885 --> 23:17.684
Yeah. Who knows?

23:17.686 --> 23:20.988
Yeah. So, um, to Schweikart and Cokely...

23:20.990 --> 23:22.523
and Wexler.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.269
Hi.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.371
Hi.

24:11.642 --> 24:12.908
I only have a few minutes.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.643
I have to pick Kaylee up.

24:15.813 --> 24:17.445
Okay.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.117
What did you want to tell me, Mike?

24:24.821 --> 24:27.122
I stand by what I said.

24:27.124 --> 24:29.024
The guy's a charlatan.

24:29.026 --> 24:30.959
But there's a time and there's a place,

24:30.961 --> 24:32.288
and that wasn't it.

24:36.633 --> 24:38.627
You left me quite the mess.

24:39.970 --> 24:41.547
Yeah. I can see that.

24:48.979 --> 24:52.547
It'll be okay eventually.

24:54.718 --> 24:57.552
Anita's not happy.
You might want to call her.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.566
Probably better if I don't.

25:02.693 --> 25:06.530
You know that I would never forget Matty.

25:08.699 --> 25:10.409
I know.

25:12.069 --> 25:13.802
No one expects you to wear a hair shirt

25:13.804 --> 25:15.637
for the rest of your life.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.706
Same goes for you.

25:17.708 --> 25:19.641
You and Kaylee okay?

25:20.844 --> 25:22.744
We're good.

25:23.339 --> 25:26.281
Then I'm good.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.686
I... was thinking

25:31.688 --> 25:34.623
maybe I could pick Kaylee up
from school tomorrow.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.439
Yeah, that'd be a big help, Pop.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.601
See you then.

25:46.603 --> 25:48.670
Okay.

26:04.288 --> 26:06.254
No, no. I'd tell you.

26:06.256 --> 26:08.556
Nobody's heard anything.

26:08.558 --> 26:10.592
You can go in, Jimmy. He's expecting you.

26:10.594 --> 26:12.961
- Thanks, Julie.
- Mm.

26:16.066 --> 26:17.866
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.401
Howard.

26:19.403 --> 26:20.635
This was going in the mail today.

26:20.637 --> 26:22.270
You would have gotten it by Friday.

26:22.272 --> 26:26.207
Yeah. I got a pressing need
only $5,000 will cure.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.778
Well, there you go then.

26:29.313 --> 26:30.739
Everything correct?

26:31.315 --> 26:32.881
Looks good. Thanks.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.416
Of course.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.751
Hey, I, uh, see a lot
of empty cubicles out there.

26:36.753 --> 26:38.163
What's going on?

26:39.256 --> 26:41.166
We're doing some reorganizing.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.878
Just making the office a little
more fêng shui, I take it?

26:46.096 --> 26:47.756
We've had some setbacks.

26:48.832 --> 26:50.832
Paying out to Chuck's estate?

26:52.569 --> 26:54.035
That is part of it.

26:56.326 --> 26:57.808
And to be frank,

26:58.385 --> 27:02.353
the firm's reputation is...
not what it was.

27:02.896 --> 27:05.329
So, what's the plan?

27:05.331 --> 27:08.819
The consultants call it "rightsizing."

27:09.619 --> 27:15.190
No. I mean what's the plan
to get HHM back on its feet?

27:30.774 --> 27:32.273
Are you kidding me? I...

27:32.275 --> 27:34.042
I just referred a client to you guys.

27:34.044 --> 27:35.944
You're welcome, by the way.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.946
And you're telling me
this place is falling apart?

27:37.948 --> 27:39.781
Get your shit together, Howard.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.950
- Excuse me?
- Oh, please.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.431
You suffer one little setback,

27:43.433 --> 27:46.388
and you're gonna let
your entire legacy go?

27:46.390 --> 27:48.323
- One little setback?
- Fine.

27:48.325 --> 27:50.959
Your pain is very special. Woe is you.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.128
Just stop wallowing, okay?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.896
This place is all you've got!

27:54.898 --> 27:56.865
That and your hair, which, let's face it,

27:56.867 --> 27:58.867
clock's ticking there, too, so...

27:58.869 --> 28:00.301
You want to save your business?

28:00.303 --> 28:01.703
You want to save your dignity?

28:01.705 --> 28:03.004
You're gonna have to fight.

28:03.006 --> 28:04.416
Hey.

28:05.342 --> 28:07.586
You're a shitty lawyer, Howard.

28:08.245 --> 28:09.978
But you're a great salesman.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.547
So get out there and sell.

28:13.217 --> 28:14.716
Fuck you, Jimmy.

28:14.718 --> 28:17.262
There you go. Use that.

28:21.925 --> 28:23.725
That's $4,000, please.

28:23.727 --> 28:25.493
- Here's a tip.
- Thank you very much.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.595
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- You, as well.

29:33.763 --> 29:36.383
Sorry.

29:37.634 --> 29:39.100
All set over here.

29:39.102 --> 29:40.804
You got a spot yet?

29:41.972 --> 29:44.850
Piñatas? Are you kidding?

29:46.176 --> 29:49.344
No, no, that could... could work, yeah.

29:49.346 --> 29:51.746
Regardless, we have full run
of the place?

29:51.748 --> 29:53.650
There's no prying eyes?

29:54.784 --> 29:55.950
All right.

29:55.952 --> 29:57.529
Well, that's it, then.

29:58.154 --> 30:01.756
Ah, she's fine.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.926
Yeah, I change half the water
in the tank every week.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.694
She's good.

30:06.696 --> 30:08.496
No. I know. Don't over-feed.

30:08.498 --> 30:11.165
I... All right, goodbye.

30:13.370 --> 30:14.469
What are you doing?

30:14.471 --> 30:17.505
Oh! Mrs. Nguyen.

30:17.507 --> 30:20.842
Just, you know, step right on in
anytime, you know?

30:20.844 --> 30:22.977
What's all this?

30:24.214 --> 30:25.980
It's a side business.

30:25.982 --> 30:28.182
I thought you were a lawyer.

30:28.184 --> 30:30.118
I've had a temporary setback.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.353
Lost your job again?

30:32.355 --> 30:34.822
Did you need something, Mrs. Nguyen?

30:34.824 --> 30:36.791
I don't want people coming in and out

30:36.793 --> 30:38.226
to buy your stupid phones.

30:38.228 --> 30:39.627
I'm not gonna sell them
out of the office,

30:39.629 --> 30:40.728
so don't worry about it.

30:40.730 --> 30:42.497
You can't keep them here.

30:42.499 --> 30:43.831
Uh, I pay rent for this place,

30:43.833 --> 30:45.466
so I can do whatever I want with it.

30:45.468 --> 30:46.968
They're a fire hazard.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.831
Well, they're not gonna
be here very long, okay?

30:52.575 --> 30:55.243
Hmm.

31:00.216 --> 31:02.750
That's... That's on me.

31:02.752 --> 31:06.120
No, it's, uh, prepaid, 350 minutes.

31:10.260 --> 31:13.188
Get-rich-quick schemes never work.

31:14.063 --> 31:15.396
Just watch me!

31:40.390 --> 31:43.135
The doctor tells me
your fever has gotten worse.

31:46.629 --> 31:48.932
They say this infection may kill you.

31:56.439 --> 31:58.275
Even if it doesn't...

31:59.409 --> 32:02.310
my doctor tells me again and again

32:02.312 --> 32:03.989
that you may never wake.

32:06.649 --> 32:10.818
And yet I wait.

32:26.136 --> 32:28.472
I grew up quite poor.

32:29.973 --> 32:31.516
We lived in the hills,

32:33.018 --> 32:36.688
in a place my brothers built
from things they found...

32:38.248 --> 32:41.067
metal sheeting, plywood.

32:43.119 --> 32:46.854
When it rained, it smelled like hay.

32:49.325 --> 32:51.036
We were always hungry.

32:52.621 --> 32:58.710
But there was a lucuma tree,
scrawny, barely alive.

32:59.269 --> 33:02.798
My family had given up on it
years before.

33:03.373 --> 33:05.133
Never bore fruit.

33:07.277 --> 33:13.183
When I was 7, I became fixated on it.

33:14.017 --> 33:17.646
I watered it, tended to it.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.066
It took a long time,

33:22.659 --> 33:26.627
but the buds grew into green fruit.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.829
I was so proud.

33:28.831 --> 33:30.498
I didn't tell anyone.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.534
I plucked one and hid behind our shack.

33:33.536 --> 33:35.636
I ate the whole thing.

33:35.638 --> 33:39.459
I'd never tasted something so sweet.

33:40.577 --> 33:44.445
It was like caramel.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.417
At first, we ate the fruit ourselves,

33:49.419 --> 33:52.180
and then I began taking it
to the village to sell.

33:55.425 --> 33:59.560
One day, much of the fruit
was gone from my tree.

34:02.332 --> 34:06.319
Piece were scattered
on the ground, half-eaten.

34:08.438 --> 34:12.940
I thought it was probably a coati.

34:14.577 --> 34:15.954
Have you ever seen one?

34:17.956 --> 34:22.149
About the size of a large housecat.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.920
Opportunists.

34:27.456 --> 34:33.060
I built a snare using branches and wire.

34:33.062 --> 34:35.849
It didn't take long
for the animal to set it off.

34:36.466 --> 34:39.300
But the coati thrashed so hard,

34:39.302 --> 34:41.353
it broke out of the snare...

34:42.639 --> 34:46.025
broke its leg, as well.

34:46.775 --> 34:51.212
I tried to grab it, but it slipped away.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.033
It ran under the house.

34:54.484 --> 34:58.330
I knew it would show itself
sooner or later.

35:00.490 --> 35:06.994
So I waited... for hours, into the night.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.718
When my brothers called for me...

35:15.004 --> 35:16.904
I did not answer.

35:16.906 --> 35:19.173
I didn't make a sound.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.104
I was so still.

35:26.649 --> 35:30.362
Finally, it came out.

35:31.120 --> 35:35.533
It knew I was there, but it was hungry.

35:37.493 --> 35:40.747
This time, I was ready.

35:41.998 --> 35:43.833
I caught it.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.671
It fought me.

35:49.572 --> 35:52.807
But I was stronger.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.266
The merciful thing
would have been to kill it.

36:10.493 --> 36:11.956
I kept it.

36:14.356 --> 36:16.430
It lived for quite some time.

36:21.204 --> 36:26.640
I believe you will wake, Hector.

36:56.899 --> 36:58.100
Wow.

36:58.102 --> 36:59.768
_

36:59.770 --> 37:01.069
Crazy.

37:01.071 --> 37:04.539
_

37:04.541 --> 37:06.975
_

37:08.912 --> 37:10.445
_

37:10.447 --> 37:13.248
Hallo!

37:18.122 --> 37:20.656
_

37:20.658 --> 37:22.791
_

37:50.821 --> 37:54.856
All right, gentlemen, we have
a few things to go over here.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.892
That means you, too.

38:06.770 --> 38:08.170
Kai.

38:10.647 --> 38:13.108
Over here, Kai.

38:13.110 --> 38:14.863
_

38:14.864 --> 38:17.821
_

38:31.361 --> 38:34.496
We've got four bedrooms
between the two houses.

38:34.498 --> 38:37.399
I leave it to you to figure out
the roommate situation.

38:37.401 --> 38:39.301
I assume you're all friends,

38:39.303 --> 38:41.903
and I don't really want to hear
about it if you aren't.

38:41.905 --> 38:44.673
Working kitchen so you can cook
whatever you want.

38:44.675 --> 38:48.176
The refrigerators, the cabinets
are stocked with the essentials.

38:48.178 --> 38:50.479
There's a shopping list.

38:50.481 --> 38:52.414
You write down whatever you need,

38:52.416 --> 38:54.383
and we'll get it.

38:54.385 --> 38:56.518
There is a phone in each house.

38:56.520 --> 39:00.155
It goes directly to me or one of my guys.

39:00.157 --> 39:03.058
Anything you need, call.

39:03.060 --> 39:05.594
So, when do the girls get here?

39:13.237 --> 39:15.704
Anything within reason.

39:22.079 --> 39:24.546
Any more questions?

39:28.852 --> 39:30.385
All right.

39:30.387 --> 39:33.355
You've got some time to relax
and settle in.

39:33.357 --> 39:35.773
Work starts tomorrow night.

39:38.562 --> 39:40.762
Michael.

39:40.764 --> 39:42.297
They are all good boys.

39:42.299 --> 39:44.833
Once the work begins, they focus.

39:44.835 --> 39:47.335
I see to it.

39:47.744 --> 39:50.486
What you've done here is very impressive.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.407
Thank you for that, Michael.

39:52.409 --> 39:53.972
Right.

39:55.106 --> 39:56.538
If you need anything

39:56.540 --> 39:57.973
to make this go better, you let me know.

39:57.975 --> 40:00.476
I will, certainly.

40:43.754 --> 40:45.187
Hey, Mike.

40:45.189 --> 40:46.594
Hey.

41:04.375 --> 41:07.076
You keep an eye on this one.

41:33.847 --> 41:35.143
Hey.

41:35.673 --> 41:37.039
I come in peace.

41:37.041 --> 41:39.908
I'm just... just here to make a deal.

41:40.606 --> 41:42.567
What kind of deal?

41:43.014 --> 41:46.415
Look, fellas, we... we got off
on the wrong foot, okay?

41:46.417 --> 41:48.584
I'm sure you saw me out here
selling my wares,

41:48.586 --> 41:51.520
and you thought I was just some rube,

41:51.522 --> 41:53.255
out looking to score a quick buck

41:53.257 --> 41:54.890
and just begging to be rolled.

41:54.892 --> 41:58.327
But, guys, I'm thinking long term.

41:58.329 --> 42:00.729
I see a real need in this community

42:00.731 --> 42:03.699
for safe, affordable, untraceable phones,

42:03.701 --> 42:05.434
and I'm ready to fill it.

42:05.436 --> 42:08.203
Wah-wah-wah.

42:08.205 --> 42:09.438
All right.

42:09.440 --> 42:11.273
All right, straight talk.

42:11.275 --> 42:12.875
I need to be able to sell my phones

42:12.877 --> 42:16.278
without worrying
about getting ripped off.

42:16.684 --> 42:18.580
I'm proposing

42:18.582 --> 42:21.583
if you let me sell my phones
without hassle, I cut you in,

42:21.585 --> 42:26.055
say, 100 bucks every night that I'm out.

42:26.057 --> 42:29.224
And that's money
for literally doing nothing.

42:33.931 --> 42:36.532
Why wouldn't we just take all of it?

42:36.534 --> 42:39.234
'Cause I'm talking

42:39.236 --> 42:42.571
consistent, reliable profits, you know?

42:42.573 --> 42:46.308
Sure, you can rip me off again,
take all that I've got,

42:46.310 --> 42:47.876
but then I stop selling,

42:47.878 --> 42:50.646
and you lose a valuable revenue stream.

42:56.654 --> 42:58.620
Give me all you got now.

42:58.622 --> 43:00.389
I'm trying to make money
for all of us here.

43:00.391 --> 43:01.757
Just work with me.

43:01.759 --> 43:03.325
Give.

43:03.327 --> 43:04.993
If you could just expand
your thinking a little bit.

43:04.995 --> 43:07.663
You talk too much.

43:07.665 --> 43:11.600
All right, all right,
we got a man of action.

43:42.099 --> 43:44.133
You should have taken the deal.

43:44.135 --> 43:47.269
You're, like, the stupidest
person I've ever met.

44:40.191 --> 44:42.224
Didn't know I had friends, did ya?

44:44.595 --> 44:46.828
So, what's it gonna be... fast or slow?

44:46.830 --> 44:48.530
It's gonna hurt like a bitch either way.

44:50.768 --> 44:54.269
What was that? Was it... slow?

44:55.058 --> 44:56.371
Let me...

44:56.373 --> 44:58.907
Aah!

44:58.909 --> 45:00.842
We're sorry, man, all right? We're sorry!

45:02.613 --> 45:04.924
Yeah, you are, very much so.

45:04.926 --> 45:06.448
Look, we'll leave you alone, okay?

45:06.450 --> 45:08.050
We... We won't mess with you anymore.

45:08.052 --> 45:09.618
Easy to say now, but what about tomorrow?

45:09.620 --> 45:10.852
I-I-I... I'll swear, man.

45:10.854 --> 45:12.454
I'll swear on anything you want me to.

45:14.858 --> 45:16.091
Cross your heart and hope to die?

45:16.093 --> 45:18.227
Yes. Yes, man.

45:20.231 --> 45:21.296
You mean it?

45:21.298 --> 45:22.397
Yes.

45:22.399 --> 45:23.899
Yes!

45:23.901 --> 45:26.902
Look, after this, you'll never
have to see us again.

45:26.904 --> 45:28.737
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And you will spread the word

45:28.739 --> 45:30.105
that I'm off limits?

45:30.107 --> 45:31.607
Yes. Yes.

45:31.609 --> 45:33.542
Yes. We'll tell everyone.

45:33.544 --> 45:35.925
We'll say, "D-D-Don't mess
with the cellphone guy."

45:36.880 --> 45:40.782
All right, we're done.

45:40.784 --> 45:42.117
We're done!

45:45.055 --> 45:46.622
I think they get it.

45:47.458 --> 45:49.491
Seriously, guys.

45:49.493 --> 45:52.294
We're... We're done.
Okay. We're good, all right?

45:52.296 --> 45:54.329
That's enough.

45:54.331 --> 45:58.500
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but he got the message.

45:58.502 --> 46:00.836
That's right! L-Listen to what he says.

46:00.838 --> 46:02.671
Listen to what he says.
I got the message.

46:02.673 --> 46:04.273
Uh, you know what?

46:04.275 --> 46:05.941
If it's that important to you, go ahead.

46:05.943 --> 46:08.243
No, no, no, no, no!
No! No, no, no, please!

46:09.480 --> 46:11.580
No. No, please. Please.

46:11.582 --> 46:13.248
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

46:13.250 --> 46:15.651
No, no, no, please! Please don't!

46:35.973 --> 46:40.942
You get one warning, and that was it.
