<i>Honey, all those things are true.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:28.486
<i>They're just, you know...
What?</i>

00:28.486 --> 00:30.947
<i>True lies.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.463
Okay, team, target
is approaching your position.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.007
<i>Maria, Luther, you're spotting the target.</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:51.468
<i>Helen, you're on translation duty.</i>

00:51.468 --> 00:54.637
<i>Harry, when he's in place, take him down.</i>

00:54.637 --> 00:55.722
Would you smile?

00:55.722 --> 00:56.973
We're in the nation's capital.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.684
Capital? Wow, you're a trivia machine.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.228
I didn't say "sarcasm," I said "smile."

01:02.228 --> 01:04.272
Eyes on the target.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.864
Either that dude
had too much coffee this morning

01:12.864 --> 01:13.948
or he's looking a bit jumpy.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.742
Well, he's selling top secret intel.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.285
You got to expect some jump.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.912
Ten bucks he's a runner.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.413
I will take that action.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.958
<i>Hey, Helen?</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:26.795
Our boy say anything
about where he's handing off the file?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.800
He said the drop's
gonna be in ten minutes.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.802
6th and H. Harry?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.720
Eyes on. Ready for intercept.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.056
<i>Harry,</i>

01:38.056 --> 01:39.390
Dana's called you twice now.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.600
Yeah, a little busy here, Gib,

01:40.600 --> 01:41.768
tell her I'll call her back.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.353
Copy.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.109
Uh, now she's texting.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.112
Harry, we got a 911
with three exclamation points.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.739
Three exclamation points, Harry?

01:54.739 --> 01:56.866
All right, put her through.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.660
Yeah, Dana, it's Dad.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.745
Dad, finally.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.915
Listen, I need a ring light, like, ASAP.

02:03.915 --> 02:04.916
- A what?
- A ring light.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.376
It's-it's for TikTok, to post.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.003
Dana, 911 is for emergencies.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.089
This is an emergency.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.091
Look, if I don't post right now,

02:13.091 --> 02:14.384
Brie is gonna upload first,

02:14.384 --> 02:16.136
and then nobody is gonna hear my song.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.763
Guys, the target is getting really antsy.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.307
He literally thinks
everyone in the park is following him.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.143
He's a runner.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.187
Three, two...
Don't do it,
don't do it, don't do it.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.730
And there he goes.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.275
Target's bolting. Harry?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.402
Dana, I'll call you back. Got to run.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.486
Dad!

02:40.952 --> 02:43.496
- Like candy from a spy baby.
- All right.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.873
Enough.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.667
Uh, Harry?

02:47.667 --> 02:50.295
<i>You're getting another text.</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:06.895
I mean, you can't

03:06.895 --> 03:09.814
call and say, "emergency," Dana.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.566
So, I interrupted
a computer sales meeting?

03:11.566 --> 03:14.694
You-you... Yeah. Exactly, you interrupted

03:14.694 --> 03:16.196
a sales meeting,
and meetings are important.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.072
They pay for this house, your food,

03:18.072 --> 03:20.909
- your phone.
- Okay, I told you that I needed to post.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.368
How am I supposed to be a singer

03:22.368 --> 03:23.953
if I can't even post a decent TikTok?

03:23.953 --> 03:25.538
Singer?

03:25.538 --> 03:27.582
I thought you wanted
to be a marine biologist.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.376
Oh, my God, Dad.
That was when I was a kid.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.213
- It was last year.
- I'm just trying to follow my dreams,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.048
which is what you've told me to do,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.466
and you're, like, you're crushing them.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.884
You're, like, bad crushing them.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.386
You know what you are, Dad?

03:40.386 --> 03:42.722
You are a...

03:42.722 --> 03:45.099
dream crusher.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.271
Wait, wait, wait, are you posting about me

03:50.271 --> 03:51.564
right now?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.858
You know what? This is gone.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.777
- What are you doing?
- Taking your phone away.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.029
- You can't just take my phone.
- Oh, really?

03:58.029 --> 03:59.030
'Cause I think I just did.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.325
Dana.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.997
Don't...

04:07.997 --> 04:10.124
- say it.
- I...

04:10.124 --> 04:11.876
just think you might be pushing her away.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.836
I'm not pushing her away, Helen.

04:13.836 --> 04:15.880
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.548
She never used to talk to me like that.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.008
I know.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.552
I'm not saying it's your fault, Harry.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.180
I just think, you know,
maybe she needs a little

04:24.180 --> 04:25.890
more carrot and less stick.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.434
All she has is carrots. In her room,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.103
just bags full of carrots.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.813
We're too soft on her, Helen.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.064
It's time to lay down the law.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.774
Lay down the law?

04:34.774 --> 04:36.276
Are we old-timey sheriffs now?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.403
Come on, she just needs an incentive.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.281
What if we give her, like, a point system?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.741
A point system, seriously?

04:43.741 --> 04:47.745
It's about clear expectations
and positive reinforcement.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.539
I'll talk to her.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.210
- But...
- That is laundry,

04:54.210 --> 04:56.546
and you can do that right there.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.673
Dana, where do you think you're going?

04:58.673 --> 05:01.384
Katie's. I can't even deal here.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
- Okay, I know you're upset,
but we have to...
- Upset?

05:03.511 --> 05:06.264
Dad just took my phone.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.557
That is like removing a limb.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.267
That is like a form of violence.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.728
Okay, I don't think that will fly

05:11.728 --> 05:13.980
with child protective services, sweetheart.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.399
What if we make a point system?

05:16.399 --> 05:19.694
You know, you can earn points
when you do good things,

05:19.694 --> 05:21.946
like the dishes or things
around the house for rewards,

05:21.946 --> 05:24.240
like your phone.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.409
You cannot be serious.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.748
- Dana.
- You guys literally don't even know me.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.296
How many points does she get for that?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.006
Okay, that...

05:40.006 --> 05:43.051
We're ironing out the details, Harry.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.719
Ah.

05:45.803 --> 05:46.929
<i>Guys,</i>

05:46.929 --> 05:48.598
we've got a serious incident.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.600
- I need a ring light.
- Wow.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.226
- You guys are hilarious, you know that?
- Okay,

05:52.226 --> 05:53.644
parenting is harder than it looks.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.688
Which is why I don't even have a hamster.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.274
Sorry to interrupt the fun,

05:58.274 --> 06:01.069
but the analyst guys got a look
at those files we received

06:01.069 --> 06:03.696
from the runner in the park yesterday.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.448
Eyes up here.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.869
<i>Briefing.
An unknown hacker has compromised</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:12.497
<i>key Israeli and Syrian defense systems,</i>

06:12.497 --> 06:15.124
<i>gaining control
of approximately 40 missiles.</i>

06:15.124 --> 06:17.794
<i>Your mission: find the hacker</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:20.088
<i>and unlock the systems.
Due to the risk of war,</i>

06:20.088 --> 06:23.424
<i>armed conflict
is to be avoided at all costs.</i>

06:25.093 --> 06:27.095
Wait a minute, who's behind it?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.679
The Israelis or the Syrians?

06:28.679 --> 06:30.556
Both sides say it's not them.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.518
Israel's accusing Syria.
Syria's accusing Israel.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.144
What about demands?

06:35.144 --> 06:36.521
None, yet,

06:36.521 --> 06:38.940
but no one destabilizes
the Middle East for kicks.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.943
Like the computer guy says,
we got to defuse this situation

06:41.943 --> 06:43.820
before missiles start flying.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.613
Helen, you're on the team now.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.198
You-you don't
have to raise your hand. What?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.201
Uh, how do we track down
an anonymous hacker?

06:51.661 --> 06:54.664
That's the thing about orders--
the "how" part is on us.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.254
- Who loves research?
- No.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.590
Dossiers on every hacker
in our archives are loaded up.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.802
Have fun. I will.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.899
<i>♪ I'm feeling good, good, good ♪</i>

07:21.899 --> 07:23.568
<i>♪ Like I should... ♪</i>

07:27.113 --> 07:30.658
Ugh, it's like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.410
How do you say "needle" in Russian,

07:32.410 --> 07:34.120
North Korean and Chinese?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.544
I got ten more possible suspects

07:41.544 --> 07:43.796
from Syria and Israel.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.006
Ha!

07:46.424 --> 07:47.508
Well, it ain't them,

07:47.508 --> 07:50.386
'cause the Gibinator strikes again.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.972
Gibinator? Wow, that's...

07:52.972 --> 07:54.140
really creative.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.933
Right? Yeah, it's my online handle.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.477
So, look, I reached out

07:57.477 --> 07:59.145
to a code-breaking pal on the dark web.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.772
Turns out there's
a new hacker on the scene

08:01.772 --> 08:03.608
who's been low-key bragging about hacking

08:03.608 --> 08:04.942
into military missile defense systems.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.486
Code name: Hav0k.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.778
What country does he work for?

08:07.778 --> 08:09.989
No one knows that yet,

08:09.989 --> 08:13.242
but I did identify his attack signature

08:13.242 --> 08:14.827
and I'm tracing that through

08:14.827 --> 08:16.412
multiple VPNs right now.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.497
You don't have to raise your hand.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.457
So, we just go

08:19.457 --> 08:20.833
to wherever the hacker is located?

08:20.833 --> 08:23.252
Exactly, and if it is Israel

08:23.252 --> 08:26.422
or Syria, we're gonna
need some clothes that breathe.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.007
So hot.
Ooh, what about something

08:28.007 --> 08:31.093
on the beach?
Or an island? Please say Maritius.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.178
Or Rome.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.514
You guys remember that pizza? Oh...

08:34.514 --> 08:35.723
It's none of those.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.310
It's Florida.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.521
Ah!

08:41.521 --> 08:43.481
I've never been to Florida.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.738
<i>To hack foreign missile defense systems,</i>

08:50.738 --> 08:53.241
<i>Hav0k needed processing power,
and lots of it,</i>

08:53.241 --> 08:55.076
<i>which is why he hacked NASA's data lines</i>

08:55.076 --> 08:56.619
<i>at Cape Canaveral.</i>

08:56.619 --> 08:57.995
<i>I knew he'd want to stay</i>

08:57.995 --> 09:00.665
<i>off-radar for this kind of black hat op,</i>

09:00.665 --> 09:02.792
<i>so once I narrowed down
all the possible VPN gateways,</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:05.461
<i>I singled out a cloned IP address here,</i>

09:05.461 --> 09:07.672
<i>south of Jacksonville.</i>

09:07.672 --> 09:10.007
<i>He's based in that
dumpy trailer over there,</i>

09:10.007 --> 09:13.219
<i>but don't be fooled.
Hav0k is good-- real good.</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:15.596
<i>And this kind of good
usually means dangerous,</i>

09:15.596 --> 09:17.932
<i>so heads up. Be ready for anything.</i>

09:22.770 --> 09:24.438
Windows are covered. We have no idea

09:24.438 --> 09:26.023
what's waiting for us on the inside.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.401
If this Hav0k guy
finds out that we're coming...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.778
He might wipe all the info
we need from his system, yeah.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.615
Okay, I was thinking
more about him killing everyone,

09:34.615 --> 09:36.033
but...

09:36.033 --> 09:37.743
Well, yeah, that, too.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.204
We need to surprise him. Ooh.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.164
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

09:42.164 --> 09:44.250
I think I'm thinking what you're thinking.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.253
Okay... the Can Opener.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.798
Do I even want to know?

10:26.042 --> 10:27.043
Go, go, go!

10:27.043 --> 10:28.294
Move in. Watch your flank.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.545
Don't move!

10:29.545 --> 10:31.297
- Hands up!
- Clear.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.635
Dude, what the hell?!

10:35.635 --> 10:38.679
I think our incredibly dangerous terrorist

10:38.679 --> 10:40.097
is a kid.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.395
- Who are you?
- What's going on?

10:46.395 --> 10:48.856
Who hired you to hack those systems?

10:48.856 --> 10:49.982
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.817
- We know you're Hav0k.
- Hav-what?

10:51.817 --> 10:52.902
Hav0k.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.320
I've never even heard of the dude.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.530
Oh, yeah? Whose skateboard is that?

10:57.615 --> 10:59.450
It's just, you know, like, a cool name.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.495
Who even are you?
You're not the cops, you're not FBI

11:02.495 --> 11:03.829
with the lame team jackets.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.790
We're representatives
of the United States government.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.334
Well, Biff, I've got friends online

11:08.334 --> 11:10.419
who told me how to deal
with government guys like you.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.046
I got rights.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.714
Did your online buddies
tell you how to get

11:13.714 --> 11:15.341
a lawyer to stay out of GitMo, Hav0k?

11:15.341 --> 11:17.134
Okay, let's say I was this-this

11:17.134 --> 11:19.845
awesome-sounding Hav0k character,
how would you begin

11:19.845 --> 11:21.555
- to prove that?
- We traced your code.

11:21.555 --> 11:23.099
You couldn't trace my code if I wrote it

11:23.099 --> 11:25.768
on that square forehead of yours.
So, go ask the brains

11:25.768 --> 11:28.229
of your operation.
You've got nothing on me.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.814
Are you serious?

11:29.814 --> 11:33.359
Do you want me to throw you in prison
for, like, 70 felonies?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.985
Are you serious?

11:34.985 --> 11:36.904
You want me to call the real cops on you

11:36.904 --> 11:38.948
for blowing up my trailer?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.366
You can't just take my phone.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.617
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.327
What are you gonna do?!

11:43.327 --> 11:45.913
Harry. Harry, a word?

11:51.001 --> 11:52.586
I can't believe this kid.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.296
- Remember when I talked about, you know,
- I don't...

11:54.296 --> 11:56.132
- pushing the kids too hard?
- Oh, the-the kids.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.008
Th-This k... He called me Biff.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.635
I know. He said a lot of mean things.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.137
He has no idea.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.680
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Yeah.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.306
I give up. You go talk to him.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.351
Maybe he'll give up
the controls of the missiles

12:07.351 --> 12:08.853
if you give him enough points.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.438
Okay.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.282
Hi. You can go ahead and get up.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.117
So, you're the good cop?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.994
Uh...

12:26.787 --> 12:29.999
Max... Graves? Is that your name?

12:29.999 --> 12:31.959
I don't have to answer your questions.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.675
Something wrong?

12:39.675 --> 12:41.051
It's just, I was in
the middle of something

12:41.051 --> 12:43.304
when you guys busted in. I...

12:43.304 --> 12:45.097
I just... I-I need to...

12:45.097 --> 12:46.474
Oh, no, I don't think that's allowed.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.892
Can you hold this?

12:53.647 --> 12:54.857
Okay, uh,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.318
can you just give me just one second?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.111
If you guys could just step out
for one second. So-so great.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.113
Thank you so much.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.701
I just need to tell them that I'm okay.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.620
Maybe if you help us.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.789
Those guys are like my family.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
You can't just...

13:11.791 --> 13:13.709
You can't just cut me off from my family.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.130
Mm. I'm not sure "PwnyBoee"

13:18.130 --> 13:21.842
is exactly family, but...

13:21.842 --> 13:23.344
I tell you what,

13:23.344 --> 13:24.845
you want to talk to him?

13:24.845 --> 13:26.013
Give us the missile codes.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.348
That's extortion.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.599
No, it's clear expectations

13:28.599 --> 13:29.725
and positive reinforcement.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.393
You are in a lot of trouble, Max.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.187
You do not want to live like this.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.271
Let us help you.

13:34.271 --> 13:36.315
I don't need your help. I'm fine.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.984
I wouldn't call this...

13:38.984 --> 13:42.238
- fine.
- Wow, I thought Biff was the dense one.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.490
Look, this is a satellite office.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.617
I've got a Cocoa Beach condo

13:46.617 --> 13:49.286
and three million in NFTs.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.331
Do you have three million
in digital assets?

13:52.331 --> 13:54.041
No, you don't. How do I know?

13:54.041 --> 13:55.417
How?

13:55.417 --> 13:57.086
Your basic-ass shoes.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.088
What? My shoes?

14:00.589 --> 14:03.759
Harry, maybe we should
rethink our approach here.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.386
He is working them.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.762
You think you could do better?

14:06.762 --> 14:08.556
Yeah, kids love me.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.224
Like Dana and Jake?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.142
They think you're a total dork.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.562
Me, on the other hand, they love me.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.938
Who, Jake?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.107
He's a 14-year-old boy,
of course he loves you.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.859
You're hot.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.366
A.I.-generated cipher algorithm.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.826
Kid's good.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.250
Uh, guys, we got a team of commandos
moving in on foot.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.168
<i>- About a quarter klick out.</i>
- Who are they?

14:38.168 --> 14:40.546
Could be Syrians or the Israelis.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.548
- Which one?
- I don't know.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.634
All I see is guys
in green uniforms and guns.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.428
Oh, they got lots of guns.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.679
What are we supposed to do?

14:48.679 --> 14:50.556
We need to pack up all his stuff and move.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.641
If the wrong people get access
to his computer system...

14:52.641 --> 14:53.934
That thing's the size of a refrigerator.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.102
Yeah, we don't have time for that.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.186
How much detcord do we have left?

14:56.186 --> 14:57.938
I'm on it.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.399
Wait, wait, wait, detcord?
Why do you need detcord?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.860
Who hired you? Is it those guys out there?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.194
I told you I work for myself.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.487
Why did you hack the missiles?

15:05.487 --> 15:06.822
That's none of your business.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.115
60 seconds out.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.658
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.368
What-what are you guys doing?
That's my system.

15:11.368 --> 15:12.912
Yeah, well, it's about to be theirs
if we don't do it.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.830
- We have no choice.
- No, no, no, no.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.415
Hey, Helen, can you get him out of here,

15:16.415 --> 15:18.709
- please?
- You guys don't understand
what you're doing.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.419
There are files on that system

15:20.419 --> 15:22.546
- that can't just go away.
- 30 seconds out.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.132
- Clear out.
- Well, you can't just blow up our problem

15:25.132 --> 15:27.468
<i>- like that!</i>
- 15 seconds out.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.970
Please trust me on this.
You don't want to do this.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.055
Light it up, Maria.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.855
No, no, no. That is so messed-up!

15:41.941 --> 15:44.568
Get him in the truck!

15:46.487 --> 15:47.446
Get in the car.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.241
Duck down, duck down.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.597
All right, I checked the sat feeds.
We lost them.

16:13.597 --> 16:16.016
You seeing this? This is ridiculous.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.394
I'm pretty sure it's against
the Geneva Convention

16:18.394 --> 16:20.312
to make someone pee
with their hands tied together.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.815
Keep complaining
and you can try it with your hands

16:22.815 --> 16:25.192
tied behind your back.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.860
Guys, we need to keep moving. I don't know

16:26.860 --> 16:28.362
what kind of resources
these dudes have, but

16:28.362 --> 16:30.614
they're pros. All right?
They're armed and they're coordinated.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.533
They almost slipped
right through our perimeter.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.994
Oh, so you're the computer guy?

16:34.994 --> 16:38.580
Computer man. Okay.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.625
Max, work with us and we get to go home.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.835
Unlock the missiles.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.628
I told you, but you don't seem to listen.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.839
I can't unlock the missiles
without my system,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.049
which you guys blew up!
Do you have any idea how much

16:49.049 --> 16:51.927
Bitcoin I had to get to buy that thing?

16:51.927 --> 16:54.596
You know, I've made
a lot of tough calls on this job,

16:54.596 --> 16:57.683
but this kid is testing me
and I may have to kill him.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.935
Can we put him
in front of a computer, please?

16:59.935 --> 17:01.020
It's not that easy.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.230
Even if he cooperates, it's not like

17:03.230 --> 17:04.565
we can just pop into an Internet café.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.608
Now, with the proper modifications,

17:06.608 --> 17:08.902
the Omega mainframe should work.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.362
Well, great.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.531
We could make that drive back
in ten hours.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.324
Let's hit the road.
Whoa, whoa. Are you kidding?

17:14.324 --> 17:17.369
We have no escort,
we're outnumbered, we're outgunned.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.371
I'm out of things to list.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.748
It's bad. It's just bad.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.915
Luther's right.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.459
We need tactical support, we need help,

17:23.459 --> 17:24.543
we need an exfil team.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.211
Trilby's working on it,

17:26.211 --> 17:27.880
but it's gonna take time.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.424
DoD doesn't want a firefight
with an unknown foreign power.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.010
What's unknown? It's Israel or Syria.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.470
Yeah, and if there's gonna be a fight,

17:34.470 --> 17:35.679
they got to know which one it is.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.557
And as soon as they do,
we're on the next chopper

17:38.557 --> 17:41.351
out of here. Until then, we lay low.

17:41.351 --> 17:44.605
Lay low, like...

17:44.605 --> 17:46.106
a hotel?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.983
A nice hotel?

17:47.983 --> 17:50.277
Like the Four Seasons?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.906
Luther and Maria
are setting up a full security perimeter

17:53.906 --> 17:55.866
with infrared and motion detection.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.534
I'll monitor from the van.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.286
These guys are not gonna
sneak up on us again.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.914
- You two are on Max duty.
- What?

18:01.914 --> 18:03.916
I'd rather face the commandos alone.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.793
Can you talk to him?
Me?

18:05.793 --> 18:08.962
Ooh, uh-uh.
Nah, I'm the last one you want doing that.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.882
Do the whole "kid" thing.
Make him comfortable,

18:11.882 --> 18:14.009
make him like you. Most importantly,

18:14.009 --> 18:16.470
make him give us those missiles back.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.473
Okay. Um...

18:19.473 --> 18:22.226
Oh, God.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.852
I will talk to him.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.604
I really feel like

18:25.604 --> 18:27.356
I was getting through to him last time.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.776
- You'll see.
- Okay.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.029
We can just shoot him.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.657
That kid is a handful, huh?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.492
Boys are the worst.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.662
That's why if I ever have a kid,
I will definitely have a girl.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.830
She have a name?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.832
A name?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.583
Uh, like...

18:46.583 --> 18:48.335
I always thought Sue was a good name.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.797
Sue? What is she, 70?

18:51.797 --> 18:54.049
Sue happens to be the name
of my favorite teacher.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.469
She said I had potential.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.514
But, okay, if not Sue,
what's a name you like?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.891
- Bridget.
- Bridget, okay.

19:02.891 --> 19:06.061
I imagine she'd be opinionated, like you.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.105
Opinionated?

19:08.105 --> 19:10.149
I just mean feisty.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.900
Just stop before you put your foot

19:11.900 --> 19:13.902
any farther down your throat.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.989
- I'm gonna go grab the cords.
- Okay.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.699
<i>So, kids,</i>

19:18.699 --> 19:22.244
listen. I wanted to surprise
your mom with a day trip

19:22.244 --> 19:25.706
and a romantic date night,
but we got a flat tire.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.041
The tow truck driver said it was a nail.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.502
Anyway, so we're gonna
spend the night here,

19:30.502 --> 19:32.921
we're gonna wake up,
have breakfast, fix that tire,

19:32.921 --> 19:34.339
but we'll back by lunch.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.008
How are you guys doing?

19:39.761 --> 19:42.347
I have these guys,

19:42.347 --> 19:44.099
if you're hungry.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.767
What is that, a bribe?

19:45.767 --> 19:48.937
No, I just thought you might like it.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.190
Max, I can

19:51.190 --> 19:53.942
kind of tell you haven't
been taken care of in a while.

19:53.942 --> 19:57.070
I told you.
My crew-- we take care of each other.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.031
Your "computer family."

19:59.031 --> 20:01.825
I guess I'm kind of wondering more about

20:01.825 --> 20:05.495
your real family, you know?

20:05.495 --> 20:07.539
Do they know that
you're out there all alone?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.417
Um...

20:12.711 --> 20:15.047
They're, uh, not around.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.925
Mm-hmm.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.762
Is that something you got from them?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.180
Yeah.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.057
Um, this belonged to my mom.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.023
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.150
It's okay.

20:35.150 --> 20:38.570
Thank you for telling me.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.907
Wait, what?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.659
Oh, my God, your face.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.911
What? Why would you lie
about something like that?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.121
I don't know. Go ask your husband.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.623
I can hear him lying to your kids
outside right now.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.166
That's different.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.292
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.460
I'm pretty sure it's exactly the same.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.338
Face it, you're terrible parents.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.756
And in case you weren't listening

20:57.756 --> 21:00.092
the first time,
you have trash taste in footwear.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.386
How about this? How about

21:02.386 --> 21:04.846
you don't get any more television

21:04.846 --> 21:07.349
until you learn a couple of manners?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.645
I guess you won't be watching

21:11.645 --> 21:13.063
any television on that.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.777
Uh, honey, a word?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.321
What happened to more carrot, less stick?

21:21.321 --> 21:23.824
No, you were right. No more carrots,

21:23.824 --> 21:25.158
no vegetables.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.077
More stick, more stick.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.954
- Helen, wait.
- What?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.540
I was wrong about the points thing.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.167
Maybe for every missile that Max unlocks,

21:34.167 --> 21:35.752
we give him 30 minutes of screen time.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.505
We do not

21:38.505 --> 21:42.217
negotiate with terrorists.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.264
Hey, Gib, we just had a major power surge.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.682
All the electricity is out in the motel.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.517
This could be the beginning of an attack.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.144
<i>If it is, I don't know
where it's coming from.</i>

21:52.144 --> 21:54.104
<i>Whatever just happened
came from inside the motel.</i>

21:54.104 --> 21:55.981
Inside? How?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.859
<i>I don't know. I'm just saying,
I got zilch on the satellite.</i>

21:58.859 --> 22:00.444
<i>Get to Max ASAP.</i>

22:01.445 --> 22:02.279
Max?

22:04.072 --> 22:05.907
<i>Harry, we got a real problem here.</i>

22:05.907 --> 22:08.201
<i>That surge just knocked out
the motion detectors</i>

22:08.201 --> 22:09.786
<i>Maria and Luther put up.</i>

22:11.788 --> 22:13.123
We're working on it, Gib.

22:13.123 --> 22:16.251
We seem to have run into a little...

22:16.251 --> 22:17.878
problem.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.422
<i>Guys, please tell me you got him.</i>

22:22.549 --> 22:25.218
No. He's gone.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.149
We've been searching
for this kid for ages.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.859
How can there be no sign of him?

22:40.859 --> 22:42.611
And, Gib, how did he get past our sensors?

22:42.611 --> 22:44.404
Kid's smart.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.406
He took out power to the entire building,

22:46.406 --> 22:48.283
which knocked out every sensor we had.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.411
But where would he even go?

22:51.411 --> 22:53.205
<i>Probably went to find his friends.</i>

22:53.205 --> 22:55.290
He has this online surrogate family.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.584
He probably went to go find them.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.127
Well, I haven't detected
any Hav0k activity

22:59.127 --> 23:01.004
on any of the hacker boards.

23:01.004 --> 23:03.090
However...

23:04.591 --> 23:06.760
You know, one good thing
about being in the middle of nowhere--

23:06.760 --> 23:10.389
makes it pretty easy
to find suspicious-looking SUVs.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.974
Guys, I think we've located our commandos.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.726
Yeah, well, you guys go check that out.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.686
We'll look around
the next town for the kid.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.188
Copy that.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.399
Meet at the designated rendezvous at 0500.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.824
Do you think Max was right?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.826
About what?

23:30.826 --> 23:32.911
He said we were terrible parents.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.622
Honey, you cannot listen to that kid.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.707
He's a punk.

23:37.707 --> 23:40.168
- I know.
- He's in no position to judge.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.087
You know, but, I mean, do you feel

23:42.087 --> 23:43.964
like we're good parents?

23:43.964 --> 23:46.508
I feel like they grow up too fast.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.553
I mean, it's like...

23:49.553 --> 23:51.763
I don't even know what to say anymore.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.099
It's like everything we do is wrong.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.018
Well, we push too hard...
or-or it's not enough.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.646
Or we're too strict or we're too kind.

23:59.646 --> 24:02.023
Exactly. No, I...
That's-that's what I mean.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.317
Every single thing has huge consequences.

24:04.317 --> 24:06.820
You know? The stakes are so high

24:06.820 --> 24:09.448
with every decision,

24:09.448 --> 24:11.658
the future hangs in the balance.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.493
Literally.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.081
It's... (chuckles) it's like
working for Omega Sector.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.000
Yeah.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.461
But at least there's a training manual.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.588
How can there be
a training manual for being a spy

24:24.588 --> 24:26.298
but not for being a parent?

24:26.298 --> 24:29.050
Well, technically, there's about 10,000

24:29.050 --> 24:31.470
training manuals for parenting.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.555
Well, I guess we have some reading to do.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.645
<i>How can one kid and a computer</i>

24:40.645 --> 24:42.647
cause all this trouble?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.774
I don't know.

24:44.774 --> 24:47.444
This is exactly why we shouldn't

24:47.444 --> 24:49.654
let Bridget go online
until she's at least 15.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.656
We?

24:51.656 --> 24:54.034
Yeah, I'm gonna be her cool uncle.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.410
You know, I feel like I should have

24:55.410 --> 24:56.953
some say in her in upbringing.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.788
I guess you could

24:58.788 --> 25:00.749
take her... bowling.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.958
Yeah, that's a great start.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.044
Okay, but you are definitely
just the uncle.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.587
We're not co-parenting.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.380
Okay, I'll just be the guy

25:07.380 --> 25:08.840
that gets her cool presents

25:08.840 --> 25:10.842
and drives a cool car.

25:10.842 --> 25:11.927
I'm sorry, y'all.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.053
Who's Bridget?

25:13.053 --> 25:14.513
Uh, Maria's daughter.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.473
Imaginary daughter.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.184
Have you two ever considered therapy?

25:19.184 --> 25:21.019
I know a guy.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.772
Come on, Gib, you've never
even considered having kids?

25:23.772 --> 25:24.814
Nope.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.360
All right, here we go.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.905
Harry, we're approaching
the warehouse now.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.490
Any luck on your end?

25:36.785 --> 25:39.412
Negative. Every local business is closed

25:39.412 --> 25:41.081
and we just left the bus station.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.582
He wasn't there.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.167
All right, well, keep looking.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.961
What about that?

25:45.961 --> 25:47.754
Do you see that-- that light?

25:50.006 --> 25:52.050
I don't know, may be
something from a computer.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.804
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

25:55.804 --> 25:57.764
<i>remember, this is just a recon mission.</i>

25:57.764 --> 25:59.724
<i>The SUVs at the warehouse match the ones</i>

25:59.724 --> 26:01.643
<i>the commandos were driving.</i>

26:01.643 --> 26:03.645
Eyes on target.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.021
We're moving in.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.111
Pay dirt, Gib, it's them.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.654
Can you get close enough to hear 'em?

26:12.654 --> 26:13.697
I think so.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.960
So what's our plan?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.045
For now, we wait.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.047
These guys are speaking English,
no accent.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.882
I don't think they're Israelis.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.218
No one makes a move
until we hear from The Pyramid.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.761
You hear that, Gib?

26:36.761 --> 26:38.888
- What?
- Something about The Pyramid?

26:38.888 --> 26:41.099
Never heard of 'em.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.642
We got him.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.477
Hav0k logged into a messaging app.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.062
We got his location.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.689
- How far?
- Close.

26:47.689 --> 26:48.982
We've already got a team
less than a block away.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.233
- Load up.
- Ready.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.113
- Hey, did you hear something?
- What was that?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.740
Guys, what's happening?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.700
I got nothing.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.076
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.746
Go, go. Come on, on me!

27:02.746 --> 27:04.497
<i>Guys, where are they running off to?</i>

27:06.291 --> 27:08.251
They think they found Max.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.759
Oh, so this was the plan, huh?

27:15.759 --> 27:18.303
Break into an auto shop
and get on the computer?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.722
You caused a lot of trouble, kid,
you know that?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.265
Okay, well, maybe if you guys had let me

27:22.265 --> 27:23.850
talk to my friends, I could have...

27:23.850 --> 27:25.769
Oh, your friends were that important?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.604
They thought I got kidnapped or killed.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.356
They actually want to help me.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.358
We also want to help you, so come with us,

27:31.358 --> 27:32.651
unlock the missiles. You can get back

27:32.651 --> 27:34.319
to all the computer fun stuff.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.613
<i>Harry, you got an SUV full of commandos</i>

27:36.613 --> 27:38.573
heading your way, okay? Approaching soon.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.618
- Our location's compromised.
- What? How's that even possible?

27:41.618 --> 27:43.078
He was on the Internet
talking to his buddies.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.412
They probably traced him.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.122
That's impossible. I used encryption.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.416
Well, they broke it.
That's why they're here.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.714
Gib, I got a lot of guys.

27:54.714 --> 27:56.007
We need backup now.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.384
Harry, we're at least ten minutes out.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.178
I don't have ten minutes.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.846
They're surrounding us.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.306
Those are the guys that are after me.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.933
Yes, those are the people we were trying

28:04.933 --> 28:06.976
to protect you from. Harry, what do we do?

28:06.976 --> 28:08.478
All right, you keep
the guys out front busy.

28:09.938 --> 28:10.980
I'm gonna go deal with the others.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.357
Just point and shoot. Try to miss.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.817
We don't want to start a war.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.527
Miss, yes, that.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.569
That I can do.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.184
Get down!

29:08.955 --> 29:10.832
Harry, I think I'm running out.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.584
I'll be right there, Helen.

29:23.636 --> 29:26.222
- Get your foot off me!
- Be quiet, stay down.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.315
- Clear.
- No, we're not clear.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.787
Now we're clear.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.455
Okay, that?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.290
That was awesome!
<i>Guys,</i>

29:52.290 --> 29:54.167
we got two SUVs
full of commandos approaching.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.794
You need to get out of there.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.962
- You ready to go now?
- Absolutely.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.048
All right, come on, come on.

30:10.433 --> 30:13.728
How much longer
until the rendezvous point, Harry?

30:13.728 --> 30:16.606
It was a half klick
last time you asked, Helen.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.024
Now it's less than that.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.734
Yeah, you know,
sometimes I think you guys are just

30:19.734 --> 30:21.236
making up terms to make me feel bad.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.779
How far in normal people terms

30:22.779 --> 30:24.197
until we get there?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.491
It's right there.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.456
That's how far.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.961
Guess we just missed you at the auto shop.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.547
We picked up the car after everybody left.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.131
Saw the fireworks.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.551
And the bullet holes.
You're a popular guy.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.470
If they caught me,
what do you think they would have done?

30:47.470 --> 30:49.472
They would have forced you

30:49.472 --> 30:51.182
to give up control
of those missile systems.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.643
It-it wasn't supposed to happen like this.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.978
It wasn't supposed to go this far.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.771
We can get you out of this, Max,

30:56.771 --> 30:58.982
once we get back to the headquarters.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.525
And why should I trust you?

31:01.609 --> 31:02.986
Who else are you gonna trust?

31:02.986 --> 31:04.362
Your little hacker buddies?

31:04.362 --> 31:06.364
Okay, uh, who am I supposed to trust?

31:06.364 --> 31:08.575
The government? My parents died

31:08.575 --> 31:11.619
in a freaking car crash,
and all they did was throw me

31:11.619 --> 31:14.247
- in foster care.
- They're... they are actually...

31:14.247 --> 31:16.332
Dead? Yeah.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.295
So don't... don't
tell me I shouldn't trust

31:20.295 --> 31:22.463
the only people that give a crap about me.

31:22.463 --> 31:24.299
Wouldn't your friends

31:24.299 --> 31:25.967
want to keep you safe, Max?

31:25.967 --> 31:27.594
My friends would want me to be smart.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.432
I have some bad news about that.

31:32.432 --> 31:36.311
Luther and Maria heard
the commandos in green talking.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.480
Turns out they're
not with Israel or Syria.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.442
They were hired by The Pyramid.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.444
- What's The Pyramid, Gib?
- Ask Max.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.987
He'll tell you all about it.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.406
No, you're lying.

31:48.406 --> 31:51.784
Pyramid is the name
of Max's online hacker group.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.663
His friends hired
those commandos to get him.

31:56.664 --> 32:00.168
No. No, see, you're
making this up to get in my head.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.961
Kid, I cloned their phones.

32:01.961 --> 32:04.047
I can show you the emails.
You want to see 'em?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.008
Your buddies want
to control those missiles and sell

32:07.008 --> 32:09.093
the access to the highest bidder.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.347
They hired mercenaries,

32:12.347 --> 32:14.599
told 'em where you are. Do you understand?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.601
They sold me out.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.354
Yeah.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.272
So if it's not Israel or Syria,

32:21.272 --> 32:22.815
Omega can get us out.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.111
Are those helicopters?

32:27.111 --> 32:29.572
But why so soon?

32:31.032 --> 32:33.076
Those aren't helicopters.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.619
Drones.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.120
Gib, Helen,

32:36.120 --> 32:37.497
get Max out of here. We'll hold 'em off.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.665
Go, go, go, go, go.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.166
Get out of here, go.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.224
Seriously? Exploding drones?!

32:58.309 --> 33:00.019
<i>I opened up a channel</i>

33:00.019 --> 33:02.397
for the boys in green and just heard back.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.982
They said that was a warning shot.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.525
<i>And if we don't hand over the kid,</i>

33:05.525 --> 33:07.610
they're gonna run us off the road
and come take him.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.362
Gib, can you hack the drones?

33:09.362 --> 33:12.073
I'm trying. They're using
an encrypted signal, all right?

33:20.123 --> 33:21.833
I think they're done
with the warning shots.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.128
Shoot 'em out of the sky.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.719
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey. Snap out of it.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.887
Kid, you made a mess, you understand?

33:34.887 --> 33:37.807
And when you make a mess,
you got to clean up the mess.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.268
It-it wasn't supposed to happen like this.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.520
I-I was just trying
to stop them from fighting.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.606
Yeah, well, sometimes
things don't go according to plan.

33:52.655 --> 33:53.781
<i>There's a drone on my tail.</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:55.908
<i>Get rid of it.</i>

34:03.541 --> 34:05.835
This wasn't in my training.

34:05.835 --> 34:07.503
Right now, you got two options.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.297
You can do the right thing
and help us out.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.007
Or you can let people die.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.884
You know anything about
drone control frequencies?

34:15.595 --> 34:16.679
Okay, okay,

34:16.679 --> 34:18.514
I'm gonna try to override
their control frequency.

34:18.514 --> 34:20.058
There's no way you can hack that in time.

34:21.559 --> 34:22.852
But this can.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.355
It's my A.I.-generated decryption key.

34:26.355 --> 34:28.483
- You got a port?
- Yeah, yeah, right there.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.902
Right there, plug in, go ahead.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.571
We've got more company.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.131
All right,
I set the drone controls up custom.

34:52.131 --> 34:54.133
You play <i>Combat Commander Five?</i>

34:54.133 --> 34:55.968
Dude, check the online rankings.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.678
Hav0k is top 500.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.930
Oh, that's cute.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.723
Holler at me when you get top three.

35:01.849 --> 35:04.143
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're the Gibinator?!

35:11.818 --> 35:13.736
Gib, if you're gonna
do something, do it now.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.238
I'm working, Harry.

35:24.997 --> 35:25.915
<i>Figure something out.</i>

35:25.915 --> 35:27.291
We're running out of field.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.922
Okay, now I got control of those drones.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.632
Let's fly.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.469
<i>Okay, kid, we only get one shot at this.</i>

35:53.776 --> 35:55.695
We're good. We're good.

36:09.625 --> 36:12.587
Hav0k and the Gibinator

36:12.587 --> 36:14.380
swooping in to save the day!

36:16.465 --> 36:19.135
Harry, next time, you're driving.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.898
Well, now that he's released
the missile systems,

36:31.898 --> 36:34.483
Israel and Syria have calmed down,
so looks like

36:34.483 --> 36:35.860
we're out of the woods on that one.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.362
That's great. But, uh, why is he here?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.909
I gave him a job.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.493
You what?

36:44.493 --> 36:46.662
He knows more about weapons encryption

36:46.662 --> 36:48.080
than anybody we've got.

36:48.080 --> 36:52.043
Oh, he wants to apologize
to you two for the whole

36:52.043 --> 36:53.669
"terrible parents" thing. Helen, he has

36:53.669 --> 36:55.171
a shoe website he wants to show you.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.048
Come on.

37:04.972 --> 37:06.515
Kids.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.227
- Complicated.
- Yes.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.313
I'm thinking I might need
a co-parent for Bridget.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.690
Hmm, I was thinking the exact same thing.

37:14.690 --> 37:16.943
- Really?
- Yeah, my imaginary kid, Sam--

37:16.943 --> 37:18.736
he's too much to handle alone.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.988
He's gonna need a pretty awesome mom.

37:22.365 --> 37:25.451
You know, someone who's smart.

37:25.451 --> 37:27.954
Someone pretty.

37:27.954 --> 37:30.581
Who can basically do

37:30.581 --> 37:32.792
everything.

37:36.587 --> 37:39.090
And when I find her, I'll let you know.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.051
And you'll be the coolest aunt.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.178
Oh.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.806
Uh...

37:46.806 --> 37:48.891
yeah, great.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.940
Gib really connected with Max, huh?

37:55.940 --> 37:58.734
I know, that whole responsibility thing?

37:58.734 --> 38:01.028
- Yeah.
- That was impressive.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.697
Well, it's what we would have done.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.448
Oh, totally, totally.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.950
He was just in the right place
at the right time.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.952
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.621
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.998
Hey, Dana.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.582
Can we talk to you for a second?

38:14.750 --> 38:16.460
If it's about
the ring light thing again...

38:16.460 --> 38:20.006
Well, it is and it isn't,
but can you just hear us out?

38:21.424 --> 38:23.092
Thank you.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.179
So I just wanted to say that...

38:27.179 --> 38:30.433
I may have been a little
hard on you the other day.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.519
And your father and I
aren't dream crushers.

38:33.519 --> 38:34.770
No.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.856
We want you to be a singer

38:36.856 --> 38:38.899
if that's what you want.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.528
Really?

38:42.528 --> 38:45.448
This is amazing.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.450
Okay, I was thinking
there's some stuff that I need.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.201
I'll probably need a new phone, right?

38:49.201 --> 38:51.037
One with a better camera for TikTok.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.205
Microphone would
be good for, like, clarity.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.583
We can do my room into kind of,

38:55.583 --> 38:57.835
- like, a recording booth...
- Right. About all that.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.755
I can't make your dreams come true, kiddo.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.590
That's your job.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.551
Okay.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.928
And we want to support you in taking

39:07.928 --> 39:10.931
responsibility for your dreams.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.601
So you can start paying

39:13.601 --> 39:16.437
- for your own lessons and your equipment.
- Mm-hmm.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.732
What are you guys saying?

39:19.732 --> 39:21.776
We're saying we love you.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.903
We're saying we believe in you.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.863
And we're saying that
Baskin-Robbins is hiring.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.323
Ah.
