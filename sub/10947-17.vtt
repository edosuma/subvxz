00:57.230 --> 00:59.560

take a closer look. It might not be
a giant parrot, but a flying man,

of airwalkers who laugh at gravity

01:11.570 --> 01:14.950

01:19.080 --> 01:21.790
Was it realistic?
Is that how it was back then?

01:21.870 --> 01:23.840
I laugh at gravity all the time.

Ha ha! Gravity.

It means a lot
to hear airbender stories.

I'm saying you're an optimist.
Same thing, basically.

Hey, guys, look at this!

02:33.030 --> 02:34.910

No, they're not.

What do you mean, they're not?

02:40.830 --> 02:42.960
Gliding maybe, but not flying.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.170
You can tell by the way they move

02:44.250 --> 02:47.250
they're not airbending.

Yeah, I know.
But I can do more than fancy gliding.

Wow! I don't think I can do that.

That's amazing!
I've heard stories about you.

04:54.630 --> 04:55.630
Thanks.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.050
Wow! This glider chair is incredible.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.330
Everything is powered by hot air.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.000
It even pumps hot air currents outside

05:33.080 --> 05:34.630
to give us a lift when we're gliding.

Yeah. It's great, isn't it?

Well, people around here

This is a sacred temple.
You can't treat it this way.

I've seen it when the monks were here.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.640

Who said you could be here?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.360

07:19.570 --> 07:22.650
A long time ago,
but not a hundred years,

07:22.740 --> 07:24.990
my people became refugees

07:25.070 --> 07:26.950
after a terrible flood.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.450
My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt

07:30.530 --> 07:31.740
and lost his mother.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.330
( SNIFFLES )

07:33.410 --> 07:35.460
I needed somewhere to rebuild,

07:35.620 --> 07:37.420
and I stumbled across this place.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.710
Couldn't believe it.

07:38.790 --> 07:42.840
Everywhere pictures of flying people,
but empty.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.130
Nobody home.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.550
Then I came across
these fan-like contraptions.

07:47.640 --> 07:48.800
Our gliders.

07:48.890 --> 07:51.470
Yes, little light flying machines.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.970
They gave me an idea...

07:53.060 --> 07:56.310
Build a new life for my son
in the air.

07:56.390 --> 07:59.310
Then everyone would be
on equal ground,

07:59.400 --> 08:01.190
so to speak.

08:01.570 --> 08:04.940
We're just in the process of
improving upon what's already here.

08:05.030 --> 08:09.200
And after all,
isn't that what nature does?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.080
Nature knows where to stop.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.660
I suppose that's true.

08:12.740 --> 08:18.120
Unfortunately, progress has a way
of getting away from us.

08:18.210 --> 08:19.420
Look at the time!

08:21.920 --> 08:24.670
Come. The pulley system
must be oiled before dark.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.170
Wait. How can you tell the time
from that thing?

08:27.260 --> 08:29.010
The notches all look the same.

08:29.090 --> 08:31.390
The candle will tell us. Watch.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.600
You put spark powder in the candle!

08:35.680 --> 08:39.440
Four flashes. So it's exactly
four hours past midday,

08:39.520 --> 08:41.650
or as I call it, four o'candle.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.770
Ha ha!

If you liked that,

wait till you see
my finger-safe knife sharpener.

08:47.190 --> 08:50.030
It only took me three tries
to get it right.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.700
Aah!

08:52.910 --> 08:54.040
Follow me.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.330
Hey, Aang,
I want to show you something.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.660
AANG: I just can't get over it.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.750
There's not a single thing
that's the same.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.330
I don't know about that.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.590
The temple might be different,

09:03.670 --> 09:06.840
but the creatures that live here are
probably direct descendants

09:06.920 --> 09:09.010
of the ones that lived here
a long time ago.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.640
You're right. They're kind of keepers
of the temple's origins.

09:14.010 --> 09:16.100
Besides, there is
one part of the temple

09:16.180 --> 09:17.390
that hasn't changed at all.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.350
KATARA: Hey...

09:19.520 --> 09:21.560
It's just like the one
in the other air temple.

09:21.650 --> 09:23.480
Only an airbender can open it.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.690
So inside, it's completely untouched.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.110
Just the way the monks left it.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.990
I've always wondered
what it was like in there.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.450
Aang?

09:31.530 --> 09:34.030
I'm sorry.
This is the last part of the temple

09:34.120 --> 09:35.660
that's the same as it was.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.370
I want it to stay that way.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.080
I completely understand.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.830
I just wanted you to know it was here.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.210
Thanks.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.430
These lanterns are terrible.
I can't see.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.350
Why would you
want to use fireflies for light?

09:55.430 --> 09:58.350
Hey! Close that up. They'll get loose.

09:58.430 --> 10:01.850
Fireflies are
a nonflammable light source.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.110
Cover your nose and hold your breath.

10:11.780 --> 10:14.660
Ok. So you brought me
all the way down here

10:14.740 --> 10:15.950
to see an empty room.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.280
Wrong.

10:17.370 --> 10:20.410
It's filled to the brim
with natural gas.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.460
I came across it my first time here.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.460
Unfortunately, I was
carrying a torch at the time.

10:25.540 --> 10:29.380
Nearly blew myself and the whole place
even more sky-high.

10:29.460 --> 10:32.050
I thought my eyebrows
would never grow back.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.720
Anyway, there's a vital problem
that needs solving.

10:35.930 --> 10:39.010
From time to time, we have gas leaks.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.600
And they're nearly impossible to find.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.230
So this place is an explosion
waiting to happen.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.230
Yes. Until I figure out how to locate

10:47.310 --> 10:51.320
something I can't see,
hear, smell, or touch.

10:51.570 --> 10:53.070
TEO: The wind will carry you.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.660
It supports something inside you,

10:54.740 --> 10:56.320
something even lighter than air.

10:56.660 --> 10:59.200
And that something
takes over when you fly.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.870
I've changed my mind.

11:01.950 --> 11:04.080
I think I was born
without that something.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.130
Ha! Impossible. Everybody has it.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.340
AANG: Spirit.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.710
What?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.550
That's the something
you're talking about.

11:11.630 --> 11:12.920
Yeah. I suppose it is.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.050
Are you ready?

11:16.180 --> 11:18.850
No! Aah!

11:20.430 --> 11:21.770
( LAUGHING )

11:27.060 --> 11:29.150
I can't believe I'm flying!

11:29.230 --> 11:30.860
Just make sure
you keep your mouth closed

11:30.940 --> 11:32.190
so you don't swallow a bug.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.740
Teo was right about the air.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.490
All I had to do was trust it,

11:38.570 --> 11:40.240
let it carry me.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.200
Even though Teo's not an airbender,

11:42.290 --> 11:44.330
he really does have the spirit of one.

11:47.210 --> 11:48.330
I've been thinking.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.670
If you want to see
what's in that room,

11:50.880 --> 11:52.920
I'd be happy to open the door for you.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.090
- Great.
- KATARA: Wait!

11:55.170 --> 11:56.590
How do I land this thing?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.390
What if I land over in the...

11:58.470 --> 11:59.850
( GAGS )

11:59.930 --> 12:02.640
Blech! Bug. bug.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.350
That was a bug.

12:07.390 --> 12:08.650
( CRASH )

12:08.810 --> 12:10.770
I said, don't touch anything.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.860
Oh!

12:12.650 --> 12:13.780
Oh, don't worry.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.280
That experiment is old,

12:15.360 --> 12:18.780
and that egg was just
part of last week's lunch.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.070
( SNIFFS ) Ugh!

12:20.160 --> 12:21.990
Week-old egg smell.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.120
Quick, find that egg.

12:25.450 --> 12:28.210
I can't believe I'm finally
going to see what's inside.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.760
How could something that's so small,
you can't even see it,

12:43.850 --> 12:45.430
make such a big stink?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.270
That's the solution to our problem.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.230
Yeah. If we put a whole mess
of rotten eggs

12:51.440 --> 12:53.150
in the cellar
where the gas seeps up...

12:53.230 --> 12:56.530
The gas will mix
with the smell of rotten eggs.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.900
Then if there's a leak...

12:57.990 --> 12:59.820
You smell rotten eggs.

12:59.910 --> 13:01.620
Then you just follow your nose

13:01.700 --> 13:04.080
to the place where the smell
is coming from...

13:04.160 --> 13:06.410
And plug up the hole
where the gas is escaping.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.660
- You're a genius!
- You're a genius!

13:07.750 --> 13:09.580
( BELL RINGING )

13:09.670 --> 13:11.580
Something is wrong. I've got to go.

13:25.510 --> 13:26.930
This is a nightmare.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.930
You don't understand.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.810
You're making weapons
for the Fire Nation.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.990
You make weapons for the Fire Nation?

13:44.830 --> 13:46.870
Explain all this... Now!

13:47.080 --> 13:49.790
It was about a year
after we moved here.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.380
Fire Nation soldiers
found our settlement.

13:53.460 --> 13:56.250
You were too young
to remember this tale.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.090
They were going to destroy everything,

13:58.170 --> 13:59.670
burn it to the ground.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.050
I pleaded with them.
I begged them to spare us.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.010
They asked what I had to offer.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.890
I offered my services.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.520
You must understand.
I did this for you.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.610
( DOOR OPENS )

14:21.780 --> 14:23.030
When are they coming?

14:23.820 --> 14:26.910
Soon, very soon.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.370
You can't give them more weapons.

14:29.450 --> 14:31.080
If I don't give them what they want,

14:31.160 --> 14:32.870
they will destroy this place.

14:35.380 --> 14:36.750
How can I be proud of you

14:36.840 --> 14:39.550
when your inventions
are being used for murder?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.970
I need some time to think.

14:42.170 --> 14:43.470
( BELL RINGING )

14:43.680 --> 14:45.010
You need to leave. Go.

14:45.090 --> 14:46.600
We're not leaving.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.680
Then hide quickly.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.440
You know better
than to keep me waiting.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.190
Give me what you owe us
so I can be on my way.

14:58.650 --> 15:01.490
Well? Is there a problem?

15:02.280 --> 15:04.110
No. Right this way.

15:06.950 --> 15:08.490
The deal is off.

15:08.580 --> 15:09.740
The Avatar.

15:09.830 --> 15:11.700
Aang, don't get involved.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.710
If I don't get what I came for,

15:13.910 --> 15:16.710
the Fire Nation
will burn this place to rubble.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.210
Get out of here.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.840
Uh!

15:20.050 --> 15:21.710
You're leaving empty-handed.

15:21.800 --> 15:25.380
Then the destruction of this temple
will be on your head.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.480
This is bad, very bad.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.020
Aang, what are we gonna do?

15:39.110 --> 15:41.360
How can we possibly
keep them all away?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.610
I'll tell you how.

15:42.690 --> 15:44.150
We have something they don't...

15:44.240 --> 15:45.530
Air power.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.240
We control the sky.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.490
That's something
the Fire Nation can't do.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.030
We can win.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.290
DAD: I want to help.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.000
Good. We'll need it.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.460
We finally got
the war balloon working,

15:59.540 --> 16:00.920
thanks to Sokka.

16:01.130 --> 16:02.500
This boy is a genius.

16:02.710 --> 16:04.300
Thank you. You're a genius.

16:04.510 --> 16:05.720
Thank you.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.430
See, the problem
with the old war balloon was,

16:08.510 --> 16:09.850
you could get it airborne,

16:09.930 --> 16:12.260
but once you did, it just kept going.

16:12.350 --> 16:13.720
You could put a hole in the top,

16:13.810 --> 16:15.730
but then all the hot air would escape.

16:15.810 --> 16:19.810
So the question became,
how do you keep a lid on hot air?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.520
Ugh. If only we knew.

16:21.650 --> 16:23.320
( LAUGHTER )

16:23.610 --> 16:25.650
A lid is actually the answer.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.820
If you control the hot air,
you control the war balloon.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.910
Hmm, that's actually pretty smart.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.950
Ok. We got four kinds of bombs...

16:34.160 --> 16:36.410
Smoke, slime, fire, and...

16:36.500 --> 16:37.660
Stink.

16:37.750 --> 16:40.250
Never underestimate
the power of stink.

16:47.050 --> 16:48.340
They're coming!

16:48.550 --> 16:49.720
Are we ready?

16:49.800 --> 16:52.220
Yes, but where's Sokka
with the war balloon?

16:52.300 --> 16:54.310
We'll have to start without it.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.190
( CHEERING )

17:25.840 --> 17:27.010
- Uhh!
- Uh!

17:27.090 --> 17:28.090
Ooh!

17:36.600 --> 17:38.020
Take them out of the sky now!

17:40.560 --> 17:41.940
( ALL COUGHING )

18:01.580 --> 18:02.620
We've got them on the run.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.290
We need more slime.

18:11.470 --> 18:12.550
Aah!

18:36.830 --> 18:38.160
Huh!

18:38.790 --> 18:40.370
Uhh... Uh!

18:43.830 --> 18:45.080
Whoa!

19:22.080 --> 19:23.710
Uh! Huh!

19:23.910 --> 19:25.830
Uh! Huh! Yaah!

19:38.930 --> 19:40.510
Those things are unstoppable.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.430
I think I know how they work.

19:42.520 --> 19:45.560
I remember my dad tinkering with
a counterbalancing system,

19:45.640 --> 19:47.060
something to do with water.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.560
Works great, huh?

19:48.730 --> 19:51.190
Water? Can you get me close to one?

19:51.270 --> 19:52.280
No problem.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.550
Huh!

20:19.640 --> 20:20.890
Huh!

20:24.060 --> 20:25.640
( ROAR )

20:33.150 --> 20:34.820
We're out of bombs.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.110
Come on, Sokka.
Where's that war balloon?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.790
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.170
The insignia.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.250
They think we're on their side.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.380
Then I guess
they won't see this coming.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.470
Bombs away.

20:58.470 --> 21:00.510
Uh! Hey! Aah!

21:05.140 --> 21:06.930
Oh, no. That was the last one.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.810
Wait a second. ( SNIFFS )

21:09.900 --> 21:11.060
You smell that?

21:11.150 --> 21:13.020
Rotten eggs. There.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.860
That's where the gas is escaping.

21:20.820 --> 21:24.160
What are you doing?
That's our fuel source.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.080
It's the only bomb we've got.

21:47.310 --> 21:49.060
AANG: Look. They're retreating.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.640
Yeah!

21:50.730 --> 21:51.810
SOKKA: We're going down!

21:52.150 --> 21:54.110
No! Sokka, hold on!

21:55.400 --> 21:56.650
Get ready.

22:02.450 --> 22:04.030
Oh!

22:11.330 --> 22:12.330
AANG: You know what?

22:12.500 --> 22:14.670
I'm really glad
you guys all live here now.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.960
I realized it's like the hermit crab.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.880
Maybe you weren't born here,

22:20.090 --> 22:22.840
but you found this empty shell
and made it your home,

22:22.970 --> 22:24.890
and now you protect each other.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.010
That means a lot coming from you.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.850
Aang, you were right about air power.

22:29.930 --> 22:31.390
As long as we've got the skies,

22:31.480 --> 22:33.350
we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.110
( CHEERING )

22:48.540 --> 22:52.910
This defeat is the gateway
to many victories.

23:04.590 --> 23:06.600
( MEN CHANTING RHYTHMICALLY )
