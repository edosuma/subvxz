I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

10:27.700 --> 10:29.000
RESTAURANT WORKERS FOR 20 YEARS

10:29.066 --> 10:31.200
AS YOU KNOW, THAT'S A HUGE

10:31.266 --> 10:32.200
PORTION OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE

10:32.266 --> 10:34.966
WALKED AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.900
THESE FOLKS HAD THE LOWEST WAGES

10:36.966 --> 10:39.300
OF ANY INDUSTRY PRIOR TO THE

10:39.366 --> 10:39.900
PANDEMIC.

10:39.966 --> 10:41.566
SUBMINIMUM WAGE IN THE

10:41.633 --> 10:44.100
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY FOR TIPPED

10:44.166 --> 10:44.633
WORKERS, IT'S STILL $2.13.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.233
>> Bill: THEY FIGURE THEY WILL

10:46.300 --> 10:48.533
MAKE IT UP WITH TIPS.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.033
IT'S ALL TIPS.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.966
>> THEY GET PRETTY MUCH NO WAGE,

10:52.033 --> 10:54.333
A DIRECT LEGACY OF SLAVERY.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.200
MOSTLY WOMEN WORKING IN CASUAL

10:55.266 --> 10:56.366
RESTAURANTS NOT MAKING ENDS

10:56.433 --> 10:59.600
MEET, STRUGGLING WITH HIGH RATES

10:59.666 --> 11:00.833
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND IT ALL

11:00.900 --> 11:02.766
GOT SO MUCH WORSE WITH THE

11:02.833 --> 11:04.433
PANDEMIC, TIPS WENT WAY DOWN,

11:04.500 --> 11:05.966
HOSTILITY AND HARASSMENT WENT

11:06.033 --> 11:08.866
WAY UP AND JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

11:08.933 --> 11:10.600
MILLIONS OF WOMEN WERE LIKE TAKE

11:10.666 --> 11:11.700
THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT BECAUSE

11:11.766 --> 11:14.400
THE PAY IS TOO LOW, THE HEALTH

11:14.466 --> 11:15.633
RISKS AND THE HOSTILITY IS TOO

11:15.700 --> 11:17.600
HIGH AND I'M DONE, I'VE REACHED

11:17.666 --> 11:20.200
MY BREAKING POINT AND I'M DONE,

11:20.266 --> 11:20.900
A LOT OF THESE WORKERS DIDN'T

11:20.966 --> 11:22.600
GET UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO

11:22.666 --> 11:22.900
BEGIN WITH.

11:22.966 --> 11:26.500
WE HEARD FROM MILLIONS OF

11:26.566 --> 11:28.200
WORKERS THEY WERE TOLD BY STATES

11:28.266 --> 11:29.133
YOUR SUBMINIMUM WAGE OF TURTLE

11:29.200 --> 11:29.866
DOLLARS IS ACTUALLY TOO LOW TO

11:29.933 --> 11:31.633
QUALIFY FOR BENEFITS, PEOPLE ARE

11:31.700 --> 11:33.766
WALKING AWAY FROM THESE JOBS NOT

11:33.833 --> 11:34.366
NECESSARILY HAVING ANYTHING TO

11:34.433 --> 11:36.033
FALL BACK ON BUT THEY ARE SAYING

11:36.100 --> 11:38.100
IT ACTUALLY COSTS ME MORE TO GET

11:38.166 --> 11:39.533
TO WORK IN CHILD CARE AND

11:39.600 --> 11:40.833
TRANSPORTATION AND I GET WHEN I

11:40.900 --> 11:43.500
GET THERE, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

11:43.566 --> 11:44.700
>> Bill: THE IDEA OF PAYING

11:44.766 --> 11:45.533
SOMEONE ALMOST COMPLETELY AND

11:45.600 --> 11:47.666
TIPS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO

11:47.733 --> 11:51.166
SORT OF -- EVERY MOMENT OF THEIR

11:51.233 --> 11:51.866
WORKDAY, THEY HAVE TO WORRY

11:51.933 --> 11:53.300
ABOUT BEING EVALUATED.

11:53.366 --> 11:55.800
THE REST OF US DON'T HAVE TO DO

11:55.866 --> 11:56.966
THAT.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.700
>> THAT'S RIGHT, YOU AND ME

11:58.766 --> 12:00.833
IMAGINE IF WE GOT PAID BASED ON

12:00.900 --> 12:02.866
HOW MUCH PEOPLE LIKED US.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.500
YOUR AUDIENCE COME ON A

12:04.566 --> 12:05.633
PROFESSOR, MY STUDENTS.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.100
IMAGINE IF OUR ENTIRE PAY WAS

12:07.166 --> 12:08.333
HOW WELL I GRADED PEOPLE, THAT'S

12:08.400 --> 12:09.766
WHAT THESE WOMEN ARE GOING

12:09.833 --> 12:11.433
THROUGH, IT'S WHAT RESTAURANT

12:11.500 --> 12:12.700
WORKERS ARE GOING THROUGH,

12:12.766 --> 12:13.733
CONSTANTLY BEING EVALUATED.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.833
DURING THE PANDEMIC A LOT OF

12:17.900 --> 12:18.633
WOMEN WERE TOLD TO TAKE OFF YOUR

12:18.700 --> 12:21.333
MASK SO I COULD SEE HOW CUTE YOU

12:21.400 --> 12:24.133
ARE, TAKE OFF YOUR MASK BEFORE I

12:24.200 --> 12:25.833
DECIDE HOW MUCH I WANT TO TIP,

12:25.900 --> 12:27.200
THAT MADE IT LIFE-THREATENING

12:27.266 --> 12:29.966
AND WOMEN WERE LIKE I'M DONE.

12:30.033 --> 12:33.633
[APPLAUSE]

12:33.700 --> 12:35.766
>> Bill: WHAT IS THE LONG-TERM

12:35.833 --> 12:37.500
PROGNOSIS FOR RESTAURANTS, WE'VE

12:37.566 --> 12:38.200
SEEN SO MANY CHANGES A LOT OF

12:38.266 --> 12:39.200
THEM DID CLOSE.

12:39.266 --> 12:41.400
I READ SOMETHING LIKE 14% WHICH

12:41.466 --> 12:42.933
I THOUGHT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

12:43.000 --> 12:43.166
HIGHER.

12:43.233 --> 12:44.600
UNVISITED BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT

12:44.666 --> 12:47.866
WHICH WAS GREAT.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.066
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A SHIT SHOW IN

12:49.133 --> 12:50.733
A RESTAURANT DURING THE

12:50.800 --> 12:51.366
PANDEMIC, IT'S A STUPID PREMISE

12:51.433 --> 12:53.533
TO HAVE IT OPEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE

12:53.600 --> 12:57.500
TO EXPOSE YOUR PIE HOLE TO EAT.

12:57.566 --> 12:59.333
THIS NONSENSE OF YOU PUT THE

12:59.400 --> 13:02.900
MASK ON WHEN YOU WALK TO THE

13:02.966 --> 13:03.966
BATHROOM, >> A LOT OF RESTAURANT

13:04.033 --> 13:05.766
WORKERS DIED DURING THE PANDEMIC

13:05.833 --> 13:07.666
BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPOSED.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.300
THEY WERE TRYING TO ENFORCE

13:09.366 --> 13:10.566
THESE RULES, IMAGINE TRYING TO

13:10.633 --> 13:11.700
TELL PEOPLE, THEY WERE THE ONES

13:11.766 --> 13:13.900
PUT IN CHARGE -- WHERE YOUR

13:13.966 --> 13:15.600
MASK, SIT 6 FEET APART, LET ME

13:15.666 --> 13:16.900
SEE YOUR VACCINATION CARD ON THE

13:16.966 --> 13:18.233
SAME PEOPLE FROM WHO THEY HAD TO

13:18.300 --> 13:20.466
GET TIPS TO MAKE UP THEIR WAGE,

13:20.533 --> 13:21.800
THAT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE

13:21.866 --> 13:22.100
SITUATION.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.633
THAT WAS THE POINT AT WHICH

13:23.700 --> 13:24.266
PEOPLE WERE DONE.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.433
THE GOOD NEWS, THE SILVER LINING

13:26.500 --> 13:28.166
IS WE HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF

13:28.233 --> 13:29.966
RESTAURANTS RESPOND TO THIS BY

13:30.033 --> 13:31.333
RAISING THEIR WAGES.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.466
WE HAVE SEEN RESTAURANTS WHO ARE

13:33.533 --> 13:36.966
PAYING TWO AND $3 NOW PAYING 15,

13:37.033 --> 13:39.066
25, WE'VE BEEN TRACKING

13:39.133 --> 13:39.700
RESTAURANTS PAYING 50 BUCKS AN

13:39.766 --> 13:41.633
HOUR BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET

13:41.700 --> 13:41.833
STAFF.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.333
[APPLAUSE]

13:44.400 --> 13:45.533
>> Bill: EVERYONE IS

13:45.600 --> 13:47.466
APPLAUDING BUT THE PROBLEM IS

13:47.533 --> 13:48.866
IT'S EASY TO APPLAUD, WHAT THEY

13:48.933 --> 13:50.900
DON'T WANT IS WHEN THEY GO TO

13:50.966 --> 13:51.666
THE RESTAURANT FOR THE EGGS

13:51.733 --> 13:58.566
BENEDICT TO GO FROM $8 TO 14.

13:58.633 --> 13:59.533
>> IT WON'T.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.333
>> Bill: IT WILL AND IT

14:00.400 --> 14:00.566
SHOULD.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.533
WHEN I WAS A KID WE NEVER ATE

14:02.600 --> 14:04.900
OUT, NEVER, IT WAS NOT A THING,

14:04.966 --> 14:06.300
PEOPLE DIDN'T, IT WAS FOR RICH

14:06.366 --> 14:06.766
PEOPLE.

14:06.833 --> 14:09.166
NOW EVERYONE EATS OUT ALL THE

14:09.233 --> 14:10.000
TIME.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.333
IF YOU'RE DOING WELL ENOUGH TO

14:11.400 --> 14:14.466
EAT OUT, THEN YOU SHOULD PAY.

14:14.533 --> 14:17.000
>> THERE WILL BE MODERATE PRICE

14:17.066 --> 14:18.400
INCREASES BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL

14:18.466 --> 14:20.400
YOU HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE WAGE

14:20.466 --> 14:22.566
IS $15 AN HOUR EVEN FOR SERVERS,

14:22.633 --> 14:24.366
PRICES AND I'VE COMPARED THEM AT

14:24.433 --> 14:26.100
APPLEBEE'S AND IHOP AND DENNY'S

14:26.166 --> 14:27.800
ARE EXACTLY THE SAME HERE AS

14:27.866 --> 14:30.566
THEY ARE IN NEW MEXICO WHERE

14:30.633 --> 14:31.733
IT'S $2.13 WHICH IS WHAT THEY

14:31.800 --> 14:32.900
PAY THEIR SERVERS, THESE

14:32.966 --> 14:35.333
COMPANIES ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF

14:35.400 --> 14:36.966
DOLLARS IN PROFIT PAYING PEOPLE

14:37.033 --> 14:38.933
NOTHING.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.066
AND CHARGING THE SAME.

14:42.133 --> 14:43.066
>> Bill: IT'S CORPORATE

14:43.133 --> 14:44.266
WELFARE BECAUSE WHEN COMPANIES

14:44.333 --> 14:46.000
DON'T PAY THE WORKER ENOUGH, WHO

14:46.066 --> 14:47.066
HAS TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE?

14:47.133 --> 14:52.866
>> WE DO, $16 BILLION A YEAR AND

14:52.933 --> 14:54.333
TAXPAYERS SPENDING TO SUBSIDIZE

14:54.400 --> 14:54.900
WORKERS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

14:54.966 --> 14:56.333
AFFORD TO LIVE.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.066
THE POINT IS IF WAGES ARE GOING

14:57.133 --> 14:58.500
UP, WORKERS ARE SAYING WE WON'T

14:58.566 --> 14:59.700
WORK FOR THIS ANYMORE,

14:59.766 --> 15:02.133
RESTAURANTS CAN'T FIND ENOUGH

15:02.200 --> 15:03.166
PEOPLE, WE NEED ELECTED

15:03.233 --> 15:05.133
OFFICIALS TO ACTUALLY RAISE THE

15:05.200 --> 15:07.466
MINIMUM WAGE.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.933
IF WORKERS ARE SAYING WE WANT TO

15:09.000 --> 15:10.833
PUT UP WITH IT ANYMORE AND

15:10.900 --> 15:12.300
EMPLOYEES ARE SAYING I'M RAISING

15:12.366 --> 15:14.133
MY WAGE BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE,

15:14.200 --> 15:14.866
WHAT IS WRONG WITH CONGRESS THAT

15:14.933 --> 15:16.700
THEY CAN'T SEE THE DIRECTION THE

15:16.766 --> 15:18.500
COUNTRY IS MOVING IN?

15:18.566 --> 15:19.466
>> Bill: CONGRESS IS HALF

15:19.533 --> 15:20.100
REPUBLICAN, THEY'RE NEVER GOING

15:20.166 --> 15:23.733
TO VOTE FOR THAT, IT'S NOT THEIR

15:23.800 --> 15:24.666
PHILOSOPHY.

15:24.733 --> 15:26.200
BUT IF THE DEMOCRATS WITHOUT

15:26.266 --> 15:26.766
BEING DISTRACTED BY OTHER

15:26.833 --> 15:29.166
BULLSHIT ISSUES AND CONCENTRATE

15:29.233 --> 15:31.166
ON THE MINIMUM WAGE PICK I COULD

15:31.233 --> 15:32.700
GIVE THEM THE THREE ISSUES THEY

15:32.766 --> 15:35.300
CAN WIN ON EVERY ELECTION.

15:35.366 --> 15:36.866
>> ITS UNIVERSALLY POPULAR.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.933
>> Bill: MINIMUM WAGE.

15:39.000 --> 15:39.966
>> SOME REPUBLICAN SUPPORT

15:40.033 --> 15:41.733
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.866
WE WERE AT A RALLY IN ALBANY ON

15:42.933 --> 15:45.733
THE SAME DAY THAT THE MAGA FOLKS

15:45.800 --> 15:49.000
WERE OUT THERE FIGHTING THE

15:49.066 --> 15:50.900
ELECTORS AND THEY CAME OVER TO

15:50.966 --> 15:52.800
OUR RALLY FIGHTING FOR $15, WE

15:52.866 --> 15:54.700
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO

15:54.766 --> 15:55.933
ATTACK US, THEY JOINED OUR

15:56.000 --> 15:57.900
RALLY, THEY SAY WE BELIEVE IN

15:57.966 --> 15:59.933
THAT, WE BELIEVE AND $15,

16:00.000 --> 16:00.666
EVERYBODY AGREES.

16:00.733 --> 16:03.433
IF YOU WORK, YOU SHOULD GET

16:03.500 --> 16:04.233
RENUMERATION FOR YOUR WORK.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.300
>> Bill: I DON'T EVEN KNOW IT

16:05.366 --> 16:08.333
HOW YOU LIVE ON $15, IT'S

16:08.400 --> 16:08.866
RIDICULOUS.

16:08.933 --> 16:11.300
>> CONGRESS CAN DO THIS, D.C.

16:11.366 --> 16:12.966
CAN DO THIS, EVERY STATE CAN PAY

16:13.033 --> 16:15.333
PEOPLE A FULL MINIMUM WAGE WITH

16:15.400 --> 16:15.833
TIPS ON TOP.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.000
>> Bill: WHAT YOU MAKE ABOUT

16:18.066 --> 16:18.566
THESE GIANT SHORTAGES WE ARE

16:18.633 --> 16:21.533
HAVING NOW?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.700
I READ THAT A LOT OF IT IS

16:23.766 --> 16:25.133
BECAUSE WE HAVE 80,000 TRUCKER

16:25.200 --> 16:27.766
JOBS THAT ARE NOT FULFILLED THE.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.700
HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED INTO THAT

16:30.766 --> 16:30.966
INDUSTRY?

16:31.033 --> 16:32.933
>> I'M LOOKING AT THE WHOLE FOOD

16:33.000 --> 16:34.666
SYSTEM AND THERE ARE SHORTAGES

16:34.733 --> 16:36.066
FROM FARMWORKERS TO FOOD

16:36.133 --> 16:37.666
TRANSPORTATION TO RETAIL TO

16:37.733 --> 16:38.933
RESTAURANTS, PEOPLE ARE DONE

16:39.000 --> 16:41.300
WITH LOW-WAGE WORK ACROSS THE

16:41.366 --> 16:41.600
ECONOMY.

16:41.666 --> 16:45.166
WE ARE CALLING AT THE END OF

16:45.233 --> 16:45.500
LOW-WAGE WORK.

16:45.566 --> 16:45.766
[APPLAUSE]

16:45.833 --> 16:47.233
>> Bill: I'M SURPRISED AT THE

16:47.300 --> 16:48.200
TRUCKER JOB BECAUSE I THOUGHT

16:48.266 --> 16:49.400
THEY ACTUALLY MADE PRETTY GOOD

16:49.466 --> 16:54.466
MONEY AND YOU GET TO TAKE SPEED.

16:54.533 --> 16:54.733
[LAUGHTER]

16:54.800 --> 16:56.900
>> IT'S STILL A PRETTY TOUGH

16:56.966 --> 16:57.266
JOB.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.366
>> Bill: PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE

16:58.433 --> 17:00.433
IT, GOOD BUDDY?

17:00.500 --> 17:03.533
LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE UP THERE.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.433
[LAUGHTER]

17:05.500 --> 17:07.433
>> YOU WANT TO GET PAID FOR

17:07.500 --> 17:08.833
WORKING A TOUGH JOB.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.266
I THINK YES, PEOPLE GET PAID A

17:10.333 --> 17:11.333
LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN

17:11.400 --> 17:12.666
RESTAURANT WORKERS BUT NOT

17:12.733 --> 17:14.533
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH STAYING.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.300
>> Bill: YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IT

17:16.366 --> 17:17.500
DOES SEEM LIKE THE YOUNGER

17:17.566 --> 17:18.600
GENERATION HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA

17:18.666 --> 17:18.900
ABOUT WORK.

17:18.966 --> 17:22.166
THEY ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH IT, AS

17:22.233 --> 17:23.933
A CONCEPT IN GENERAL.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.400
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

17:24.466 --> 17:32.033
MILLENNIALS AND THE G GEN Z --

17:32.100 --> 17:33.333
THEY HAVE AN ATTITUDE THEY KIND

17:33.400 --> 17:34.000
OF RESENT THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE

17:34.066 --> 17:35.733
A JOB AT ALL.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.300
THERE IS A LOT OF THAT, SORT OF

17:39.366 --> 17:40.800
LIKE THIS WHOLE STARTING AT THE

17:40.866 --> 17:43.433
BOTTOM THING, I THINK THEY

17:43.500 --> 17:44.000
FIND --

17:44.066 --> 17:46.433
>> I DON'T KNOW WHICH HOTELS ARE

17:46.500 --> 17:47.000
GOING TO.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.966
>> Bill: GOOD ONES!

17:49.033 --> 17:50.700
>> THE RESTAURANT WORKERS I

17:50.766 --> 17:51.100
KNOW --

17:51.166 --> 17:52.900
>> Bill: RESTAURANTS ARE

17:52.966 --> 17:53.166
DIFFERENT.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.700
>> HOTEL WORKERS, TWO, THREE

17:55.766 --> 17:59.066
JOBS, I KNOW MILLENNIALS WORKING

17:59.133 --> 18:00.866
2-3 JOBS, SUPPORTING FAMILIES,

18:00.933 --> 18:03.133
SUPPORTING KIDS, STRUGGLING TO

18:03.200 --> 18:06.266
MAKE ENDS MEET AND I THINK THEY

18:06.333 --> 18:06.900
ARE SAYING AND I THINK WE SHOULD

18:06.966 --> 18:11.233
ALL BE SAYING EVERYBODY DESERVES

18:11.300 --> 18:12.000
TO WORK ONE JOB AND GET ENOUGH

18:12.066 --> 18:14.633
OF THE WAGE TO FEED THEIR

18:14.700 --> 18:16.066
FAMILY, ONE JOB.

[APPLAUSE]

18:16.400 --> 18:19.266
AND ENJOY LIFE AND BE HAPPY.

18:19.333 --> 18:19.800
>> Bill: A LOT OF PEOPLE,

18:19.866 --> 18:25.466
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE ECONOMY IS

18:25.533 --> 18:26.100
GIG WORKERS.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.166
THOSE ARE JOBS THAT DON'T HAVE

18:27.233 --> 18:28.966
THE SUPPORT OF REGULAR JOB HAS

18:29.033 --> 18:30.466
COME YOU DON'T GET HEALTH

18:30.533 --> 18:32.666
BENEFITS, THERE'S NO UNIONS.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.700
>> THEY ARE INDEPENDENT

18:34.766 --> 18:36.900
CONTRACTORS, THEY REALLY ARE

18:36.966 --> 18:38.900
EMPLOYEES BUT THESE HUGE

18:38.966 --> 18:39.400
COMPANIES.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.766
HUBER, LIFT, DOOR , INSTA CARTS

18:41.833 --> 18:42.500
ARE GETTING AWAY WITH CLAIMING

18:42.566 --> 18:43.866
THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYEES WHEN IN

18:43.933 --> 18:45.200
FACT THEY ARE, NOT PAYING

18:45.266 --> 18:46.833
MINIMUM WAGE, MAKING THEM PAY

18:46.900 --> 18:48.033
FOR THEIR OWN COSTS, THEY HAVE

18:48.100 --> 18:49.333
TO COVER THEIR OWN CAR, COVER

18:49.400 --> 18:51.866
THEIR OWN GAS, COVER THE WAY TO

18:51.933 --> 18:52.800
GET THERE AND NO BENEFITS AND

18:52.866 --> 18:55.666
NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON.

18:55.733 --> 18:57.400
GOUGING US, YOU'VE ALL SEEN

18:57.466 --> 18:59.300
PRICES GOING UP DURING THE

18:59.366 --> 19:00.900
PANDEMIC, THEY HAVE BENEFITED SO

19:00.966 --> 19:04.733
MUCH DURING THE PANDEMIC.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.300
IT'S TIME TO REGULATE THESE

19:05.366 --> 19:06.200
COMPANIES AND MAKE THEM PAY A

19:06.266 --> 19:08.833
LIVABLE WAGE.

LET ME CONTINUE THAT DISCUSSION

19:51.700 --> 19:53.366
A LITTLE BIT WITH YOU GUYS

19:53.433 --> 19:54.933
BECAUSE CERTAINLY THIS IS YOUR

19:55.000 --> 19:55.433
WHEELHOUSE.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.633
I HEARD TODAY IF YOU WANT TO GET

19:57.700 --> 19:58.300
YOUR PRESENTS FOR CHRISTMAS, YOU

19:58.366 --> 20:02.533
NEED TO SHOP NOW.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.900
IT'S NOT EVEN THE HOLLOWING PART

20:07.966 --> 20:10.766
OF THE TRIPLE HOLIDAY I THINK WE

20:10.833 --> 20:11.866
SHOULD START.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.866
STUFF IS SITTING ON DOC'S.

20:13.933 --> 20:15.700
I READ THIS, WAGES ARE BAD,

20:15.766 --> 20:16.333
PEOPLE ARE FED UP.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.466
THIS IS FROM THE NATIONAL BUREAU

20:18.533 --> 20:20.433
OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, BETWEEN 50

20:20.500 --> 20:22.300
AND 70% OF CHANGES IN U.S. WAGE

20:22.366 --> 20:25.966
STRUCTURE IN THE LAST FOUR

20:26.033 --> 20:27.533
DECADES ACCOUNTED BY THE

20:27.600 --> 20:29.000
RELATIVE WAGE DECLINES OF GROUPS

20:29.066 --> 20:31.566
AND INDUSTRIES EXPERIENCING

20:31.633 --> 20:31.966
RAPID AUTOMATION.

20:32.033 --> 20:33.866
AND OTHER WORDS, IF YOU ARE

20:33.933 --> 20:35.333
DOING SOMETHING THAT A ROBOT CAN

20:35.400 --> 20:36.666
TAKE YOUR PLACE, THAT IS WHAT

20:36.733 --> 20:40.833
THEY ARE SAYING IS THE ECONOMIC

20:40.900 --> 20:41.266
PROBLEM.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.600
OUTSIDE OF YOU TALKING ABOUT IT,

20:44.666 --> 20:45.833
THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU HEAR.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.500
IT'S MORE SOCIAL JUSTICE STUFF.

20:47.566 --> 20:49.633
BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE REAL

20:49.700 --> 20:51.333
REASON.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.566
>> AMERICANS CAN SENSE OUR

20:52.633 --> 20:53.733
ECONOMY IS TRANSFORMING BEFORE

20:53.800 --> 20:55.400
OUR EYES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

20:55.466 --> 20:57.433
AND THAT GOT ACCELERATED BY THE

20:57.500 --> 20:58.066
PANDEMIC.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.100
THE REALITY IS IT'S HITTING

20:59.166 --> 21:02.966
EVERY INDUSTRY AND WE ARE SEEING

21:03.033 --> 21:05.433
SUPPLY CHAINS DISRUPTIONS RIGHT

21:05.500 --> 21:05.600
NOW.

21:05.666 --> 21:06.800
WE'VE BEEN PRETENDING IF THE

21:06.866 --> 21:09.333
70s OR 80s AS THE ECONOMY

21:09.400 --> 21:12.066
HAS EVOLVED, IT'S LEFT WAY TOO

21:12.133 --> 21:13.600
MANY WORKERS BEHIND.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.266
I AGREED THERE NEEDS TO BE A

21:15.333 --> 21:16.066
REEVALUATION IN RECOGNITION OF

21:16.133 --> 21:17.133
WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET

21:17.200 --> 21:24.700
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK.

21:24.766 --> 21:25.433
[APPLAUSE]

21:25.500 --> 21:26.933
>> Bill: AT SOME POINT, YOU

21:27.000 --> 21:28.566
GOT TO EAT.

21:28.633 --> 21:29.466
THAT WILL GET PEOPLE BACK TO

21:29.533 --> 21:32.400
WORK, DON'T YOU THINK?

21:32.466 --> 21:33.066
I DON'T THINK WE CAN CONTINUE ON

21:33.133 --> 21:36.033
THE PATH WE ARE ON WITH THE

21:36.100 --> 21:38.500
STOCK MARKET KEEPS GOING UP, DO

21:38.566 --> 21:39.200
YOU?

21:39.266 --> 21:42.066
YOU SEE GOOD THINGS IN OUR

21:42.133 --> 21:43.033
ECONOMIC FUTURE WITH WHAT'S

21:43.100 --> 21:45.833
GOING ON WITH OUR POLITICS AND

21:45.900 --> 21:48.700
WITH OUR DEFICIT?

21:48.766 --> 21:54.400
I READ TODAY, SOMETHING LIKE

21:54.466 --> 21:55.266
2.7 TRILLION, WE NEVER HAD ONE

21:55.333 --> 21:58.966
THIS HIGH EXCEPT LAST YEAR.

21:59.033 --> 22:00.866
I DON'T SEE GOOD THINGS

22:00.933 --> 22:03.100
ECONOMICALLY ON THE HORIZON.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.833
>> A LOT OF IT IS THAT WHEN YOU

22:04.900 --> 22:09.466
TALK ABOUT THE CAPITAL E

22:09.533 --> 22:10.566
ECONOMY, WE'VE BEEN BRAINWASHED

22:10.633 --> 22:12.066
INTO THINKING THE INPUTS ARE

22:12.133 --> 22:12.700
FUELS.

22:12.766 --> 22:13.366
IF THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL WE

22:13.433 --> 22:15.933
SHOULD BE GLAD EVEN IF THE

22:16.000 --> 22:17.166
QUALITY OF LIFE HAS DEGRADED TO.

22:17.233 --> 22:19.700
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEASURES WE

22:19.766 --> 22:21.033
ALL CARE ABOUT LIKE INFANT

22:21.100 --> 22:22.600
MORTALITY RATE, MENTAL HEALTH,

22:22.666 --> 22:25.033
LIFE EXPECTANCY, THE BASICS --

22:25.100 --> 22:27.033
ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, WE ARE

22:27.100 --> 22:28.333
20TH IN THE WORLD AND DECLINING.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.100
WE HAVE TO GET FOCUSED ON WITH

22:30.166 --> 22:32.033
THE ECONOMY NEEDS FOR US, OUR

22:32.100 --> 22:33.200
FAMILIES, COMMUNITIES, NOT

22:33.266 --> 22:34.666
WORSHIP THE STOCK MARKET OR GDP

22:34.733 --> 22:36.833
GROWTH BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE

22:36.900 --> 22:37.833
GOING TO GO TO THE MOON THANKS

22:37.900 --> 22:38.633
TO TECHNOLOGY.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.233
BEFORE GOING TO LOOK UP AND SAY

22:40.300 --> 22:41.533
THINGS ARE GOING WELL, HAPPILY

22:41.600 --> 22:44.233
PEOPLE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

22:44.300 --> 22:45.300
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T MADE

22:45.366 --> 22:46.966
PROGRESS IN THIS DIRECTION ARE

22:47.033 --> 22:48.900
THE FOLKS IN D.C. BECAUSE THEY

22:49.000 --> 22:50.366
ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS FROM

22:50.433 --> 22:52.900
TEN, 20, 30 YEARS AGO.

22:52.966 --> 22:53.700
[APPLAUSE]

22:53.766 --> 22:55.066
>> Bill: THEY ARE HAVING

22:55.133 --> 22:55.866
CONVERSATIONS APROPOS TO WHAT

22:55.933 --> 22:57.533
YOUR BOOK IS ABOUT, IF YOU LIKE

22:57.600 --> 22:59.266
PEOPLE ARE GETTING YELLED AT IN

22:59.333 --> 23:01.300
A CONFERENCE ROOM BY ROBIN

23:01.366 --> 23:03.700
D'ANGELO, WHEN THIS REPORT

23:03.766 --> 23:07.200
DOESN'T MENTION THAT ISSUE.

23:07.266 --> 23:07.633
IT JUST SAYS ROBOTS.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.200
>> THIS IS THE TRAGEDY.

23:10.266 --> 23:11.266
IF YOU READ THE CIVIL RIGHTS

23:11.333 --> 23:12.700
LITERATURE FROM 50 YEARS AGO,

23:12.766 --> 23:14.066
AUTOMATION IS ALREADY SOMETHING

23:14.133 --> 23:16.366
THAT PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT,

23:16.433 --> 23:19.633
THE IDEA WAS WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF

23:19.700 --> 23:21.033
LEGALIZED SEGREGATION AND WE'VE

23:21.100 --> 23:21.800
GOT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.433
NOW WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE

23:23.500 --> 23:24.533
FACT THAT IT'S GETTING HARDER TO

23:24.600 --> 23:26.500
HAVE A JOB IT'S ALL ABOUT

23:26.566 --> 23:27.733
MACHINES, THAT YOU CAN'T ONLY

23:27.800 --> 23:29.666
HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION.

23:29.733 --> 23:31.433
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT CIVIL

23:31.500 --> 23:34.800
RIGHTS LEADERS WAY BACK WHEN, IN

23:34.866 --> 23:36.866
CAT EYE GLASSES AND DRINKING

23:36.933 --> 23:38.166
MARTINIS AND TALKING ABOUT

23:38.233 --> 23:38.666
AUTOMATION.

23:38.733 --> 23:40.866
AND YET TODAY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

23:40.933 --> 23:43.133
WHAT BLACK PEOPLE NEED, WHEN

23:43.200 --> 23:44.433
FRANKLY BECAUSE BLACK AMERICANS

23:44.500 --> 23:45.866
ARE PEOPLE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY

23:45.933 --> 23:46.733
ELSE, THE ISSUE IS THAT YOU

23:46.800 --> 23:49.100
CAN'T GET ALONG WITH JUST A

23:49.166 --> 23:50.266
HIGH SCHOOL JOB THESE DAYS.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.866
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BECAUSE WE

23:52.933 --> 23:54.866
NEED TO FOCUS ON VOCATIONAL

23:54.933 --> 23:56.000
EDUCATION, WE NEED TO STRESS

23:56.066 --> 24:00.900
THAT IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T.

24:00.966 --> 24:01.833
[APPLAUSE]

24:01.900 --> 24:02.800
SINCE AFTER WORLD WAR II WHEN

24:02.866 --> 24:03.400
THEY ARE SETTLED IN THIS IDEA

24:03.466 --> 24:06.433
THAT THE DEFAULT WAY TO BE A

24:06.500 --> 24:08.100
LEGITIMATE AMERICANNESS AFTER

24:08.166 --> 24:08.900
HIGH SCHOOL YOU HAVE TO SPEND

24:08.966 --> 24:11.466
FOUR YEARS LIVING IN A DORMANT

24:11.533 --> 24:17.666
DORMANTPRETENDING TO LIKE SHAKE.

24:17.733 --> 24:18.900
>> LIKE A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.

24:18.966 --> 24:20.833
>> I DO PRETEND TO LIKE

24:20.900 --> 24:21.466
SHAKESPEARE!

24:21.533 --> 24:23.266
THESE DAYS WE ARE TOLD THE BLACK

24:23.333 --> 24:24.366
THING TO THINK ABOUT IS TO

24:24.433 --> 24:25.400
DEFUND THE POLICE, EVEN THOUGH

24:25.466 --> 24:26.500
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE

24:26.566 --> 24:28.466
NEIGHBORHOODS DON'T WANT THAT TO

24:28.533 --> 24:28.700
HAPPEN.

24:28.766 --> 24:30.600
THAT'S ALL VERY INTERESTING OR

24:30.666 --> 24:31.433
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT

24:31.500 --> 24:37.633
HOW THERE'S A ROCK IN MICHIGAN,

24:37.700 --> 24:38.233
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN

24:38.300 --> 24:39.966
AND SOMEBODY CALLED IT A DIRTY

24:40.033 --> 24:41.300
NAME 100 YEARS AGO AND NOW SOME

24:41.366 --> 24:43.600
STUDENTS SAY WHEN I WALK BY IT,

24:43.666 --> 24:44.366
I'M HURT.

24:44.433 --> 24:45.833
THAT'S CIVIL RIGHTS?

24:45.900 --> 24:47.200
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT AUTOMATION

24:47.266 --> 24:48.266
AND PREPARING PEOPLE FOR

24:48.333 --> 24:49.600
VOCATIONAL JOBS THAT REQUIRE A

24:49.666 --> 24:51.066
LITTLE BIT MORE TRAINING PAST

24:51.133 --> 24:53.466
HIGH SCHOOL BUT I GUESS THAT IS

24:53.533 --> 24:54.133
NOT ANTIRACISM.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.800
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS

24:56.866 --> 24:57.466
INFORMS OUR NATIONAL POLITICS.

24:57.533 --> 24:59.666
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN IOWA

24:59.733 --> 25:03.133
AND OHIO, TWO STATES THAT WENT

25:03.200 --> 25:06.166
FOR OBAMA, WENT TO SWING STATES,

25:06.233 --> 25:07.733
NOW TRUMP PLUS EIGHT AND THEY

25:07.800 --> 25:10.200
HAVE BEEN GROUND ZERO FOR THESE

25:10.266 --> 25:11.300
ECONOMIC CHANGES.

25:11.366 --> 25:12.366
WE BLASTED A LOT OF

25:12.433 --> 25:14.300
MANUFACTURING JOBS, INDUSTRIAL

25:14.366 --> 25:15.066
JOBS, AGRICULTURAL JOBS COME IF

25:15.133 --> 25:15.966
DEMOCRATS DON'T GET IN THERE AND

25:16.033 --> 25:17.833
SAY WE GET IT, THIS IS THE

25:17.900 --> 25:19.333
PROBLEM, THAT'S WHY THESE STATES

25:19.400 --> 25:20.400
HAVE SWUNG THE RENT TO BECAUSE

25:20.466 --> 25:21.466
DEMOCRATS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE

25:21.533 --> 25:23.200
MESSAGE THAT DOES NOT FLY IN

25:23.266 --> 25:24.400
THOSE AREAS THAT TEND TO BE

25:24.466 --> 25:27.766
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE.

25:27.833 --> 25:28.500
>> Bill: YEAH, DID YOU SEE

25:28.566 --> 25:40.866
THAT NEWS ABOUT JOHN SHOR?

25:40.933 --> 25:42.566
DAVID SHORE, HE GOT CANCELED FOR

25:42.633 --> 25:44.833
A WHILE.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.333
>> HE WAS USING FACTS AND

25:47.400 --> 25:47.566
FIGURES.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.233
>> Bill: JUST FACTS AND

25:49.300 --> 25:50.900
FIGURES, IT IS AFTER THE

25:50.966 --> 25:51.566
GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS, THIS IS THE

25:51.633 --> 25:56.433
EFFECT OF RIOTS ON DEMOCRATIC

25:56.500 --> 25:58.633
VOTERS, NOW HE'S BACK IS BEEN

25:58.700 --> 26:04.833
DEBILITATED, EZRA KLEIN WROTE AN

26:04.900 --> 26:06.100
ARTICLE ABOUT HIM.

26:06.166 --> 26:07.600
JUST LIKE THE SOVIET UNION.

26:07.666 --> 26:08.200
HE WAS SAYING DEMOCRATS DON'T

26:08.266 --> 26:13.000
OFTEN USE LANGUAGE THAT VOTERS

26:13.066 --> 26:14.500
DON'T UNDERSTAND IS A

26:14.566 --> 26:15.100
LINGUISTICS PROFESSOR I'M SURE

26:15.166 --> 26:16.266
YOU UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN MOST

26:16.333 --> 26:16.466
OF US.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.666
AS A COMEDIAN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE

26:19.733 --> 26:20.633
CLARITY, YOU DON'T HAVE

26:20.700 --> 26:21.133
ANYTHING.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.566
IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

26:23.633 --> 26:26.966
TALKING ABOUT.

26:27.033 --> 26:28.600
[APPLAUSE]

26:28.666 --> 26:30.166
>> IF THE WAY YOU TALK ABOUT IT

26:30.233 --> 26:31.500
DOESN'T TASTE GOOD TO THEM THAN

26:31.566 --> 26:32.900
YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NEW

26:32.966 --> 26:35.800
WAY OF PUTTING IT AND YOU CAN'T

26:35.866 --> 26:38.000
JUST THINK THE WAY OF PUTTING IT

26:38.066 --> 26:40.600
THAT IS HARD LEFT AND HAS A

26:40.666 --> 26:41.200
CERTAIN NOBLE AIR ABOUT IT IS

26:41.266 --> 26:43.066
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IF WERE

26:43.133 --> 26:45.000
TALKING ABOUT A RELIGION RATHER

26:45.066 --> 26:47.066
THAN WINNING ELECTIONS.

26:47.133 --> 26:48.266
>> Bill: THAT IS THE THEME OF

26:48.333 --> 26:51.466
YOUR BOOK, YES.

26:51.533 --> 26:53.100
>> ONE OF EZRA KLEIN'S FINDINGS

26:53.166 --> 26:56.066
IN HIS BOOK, ALL OF OUR POLITICS

26:56.133 --> 26:57.433
IS TRIBAL AT THIS POINT AND IF

26:57.500 --> 26:58.933
YOU SIT DOWN WITH AN AMERICAN

26:59.000 --> 26:59.533
THEY WILL ACTUALLY AGREE WITH

26:59.600 --> 27:02.366
YOU ON POLICY MUCH MORE THAN YOU

27:02.433 --> 27:05.833
WOULD IMAGINE IF YOU THOUGHT WE

27:05.900 --> 27:08.200
WERE IN THESE IDEOLOGICAL CAMPS.

27:08.266 --> 27:09.200
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SELF

27:09.266 --> 27:10.300
IDENTIFIED POLITICS AND WE THINK

27:10.366 --> 27:12.033
ABOUT ABOUT POLICY IS QUITE LOW

27:12.100 --> 27:14.166
TWO A LOT OF IT IS THAT LANGUAGE

27:14.233 --> 27:15.133
HAS BEEN CODED IN PARTICULAR

27:15.200 --> 27:17.300
WAYS IF YOU GO TO A CONSERVATIVE

27:17.366 --> 27:19.100
AND SAY DRUG COMPANIES, THE

27:19.166 --> 27:20.900
PRICES TOO HIGH THEY WILL SAY

27:20.966 --> 27:21.466
YES.

27:21.533 --> 27:23.233
IF YOU SAY SOCIALIZED MEDICINE,

27:23.300 --> 27:26.033
THEY WILL SAY NO, IT'S A COLD

27:26.100 --> 27:27.066
SWITCH.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.233
WE HAVE TO USE A NEUTRAL

27:28.300 --> 27:30.633
LANGUAGE TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE ON

27:30.700 --> 27:31.300
BOARD INSTEAD OF STICKING TO A

27:31.366 --> 27:32.833
MESSAGE INSTEAD OF SAYING IT'S

27:32.900 --> 27:33.433
YOUR FAULT FOR NOT GETTING WHAT

27:33.500 --> 27:34.200
I'M SAYING.

27:34.266 --> 27:39.833
[APPLAUSE]

27:39.900 --> 27:41.700
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I

27:41.766 --> 27:44.366
WOULD ALSO ADD TO AN EXTENT IT'S

27:44.433 --> 27:45.366
NOT GOING TO BE ONLY ABOUT

27:45.433 --> 27:46.200
CHANGING THE LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH

27:46.266 --> 27:48.866
THAT CAN HELP A LITTLE BIT.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.500
IT'S ALSO ABOUT CHANGING WHAT

27:50.566 --> 27:52.300
TOPICS WE FOCUS ON.

27:52.366 --> 27:52.900
THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS PEOPLE

27:52.966 --> 27:54.500
CARE ABOUT MORE THAN THEY MIGHT

27:54.566 --> 27:55.666
CARE ABOUT OTHER THINGS.

27:55.733 --> 27:57.200
TO THE EXTENT THAT WILL GET

27:57.266 --> 27:58.466
THEIR VOTE, MAYBE YOU CAN COME

27:58.533 --> 28:00.900
INTO POWER AND CHANGE THINGS

28:00.966 --> 28:02.233
ABOUT PEOPLE CARE LESS ABOUT ON

28:02.300 --> 28:02.500
THE SIDE.

28:02.566 --> 28:05.833
THAT MIGHT BE A MORE EFFECTIVE

28:05.900 --> 28:07.200
STRATEGY FOR A STRONGER MORE

28:07.266 --> 28:07.600
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

28:07.666 --> 28:08.233
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE I'M

28:08.300 --> 28:12.300
TALKING IN CODE -- A LOT OF DATA

28:12.366 --> 28:13.700
IS SUGGESTING THAT THE SOCIAL

28:13.766 --> 28:15.933
JUSTICE AND COLDNESS OF THE

28:16.000 --> 28:17.666
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO GET THE

28:17.733 --> 28:19.833
DEMOCRATS INTO REAL POWER AND

28:19.900 --> 28:20.800
THAT MEANS SOFT PEDALING TALKING

28:20.866 --> 28:21.466
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING DESPITE

28:21.533 --> 28:24.900
HOW GOOD IT MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE

28:24.966 --> 28:25.933
FEEL TO TALK ABOUT IT.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.033
YOU ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE

28:29.100 --> 28:30.500
ANGELS IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

28:30.566 --> 28:31.700
RACISM EXISTS.

28:31.766 --> 28:33.133
BUT THAT MIGHT NOT WIN YOU

28:33.200 --> 28:34.466
ELECTIONS AND THE SECOND THING

28:34.533 --> 28:36.933
IS WHAT MATTERS MORE IN OUR

28:37.000 --> 28:37.600
CURRENT SITUATION.

28:37.666 --> 28:42.233
[APPLAUSE]

28:42.300 --> 28:42.833
>> I COULD NOT AGREE MORE THAT

28:42.900 --> 28:45.300
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT

28:45.366 --> 28:46.433
MATTER TO VOTERS, I WAS THE GUY

28:46.500 --> 28:48.233
WHO IS TRYING TO GIVE PEOPLE A

28:48.300 --> 28:49.600
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.

28:49.666 --> 28:51.733
YOU KNOW IT WOULD MAKE A

28:51.800 --> 28:52.200
DIFFERENCE?

28:52.266 --> 28:54.233
>> Bill: WHICH THEY KIND OF

28:54.300 --> 28:54.800
DID IN THE PANDEMIC.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.633
>> I DID NOTICE THAT, I NOTICED

28:56.700 --> 28:59.700
A LOT OF CASH ONE OF THE DOOR.

28:59.766 --> 29:01.300
>> Bill: YOU RAN FOR MAYOR OF

29:01.366 --> 29:03.100
NEW YORK, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS

29:03.166 --> 29:04.600
BROUHAHA BETWEEN THE OUTGOING

29:04.666 --> 29:05.700
MAYOR IN THE INCOMING MAYOR --

29:05.766 --> 29:06.600
THE OUTGOING MAYOR BILL

29:06.666 --> 29:08.866
DE BLASIO WANTED TO CANCEL THE

29:08.933 --> 29:10.600
GIFTED PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS.

29:10.666 --> 29:13.200
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,

29:13.266 --> 29:15.033
THEY HAD THE BLUEBIRDS AND THE

29:15.100 --> 29:17.166
REDBIRDS IN READING GROUPS, THE

29:17.233 --> 29:19.566
BLUEBIRDS WITH THE SMART ONES, I

29:19.633 --> 29:20.066
WAS NOT IN THAT GROUP.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.400
I'M STILL BITTER ABOUT IT.

29:23.466 --> 29:26.266
IT DIDN'T HOLD ME BACK IN LIFE.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.233
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS

29:27.300 --> 29:28.600
ACCELERATED GROUP.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.733
HERE ARE THE STATS.

29:30.800 --> 29:35.366
IN NEW YORK, 70% OF THE ROUGHLY

29:35.433 --> 29:36.333
1 MILLION PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL

29:36.400 --> 29:37.866
STUDENT SAID YOU GUYS BOTH LIVE

29:37.933 --> 29:39.300
IN NEW YORK ARE BLACK AND

29:39.366 --> 29:40.166
LATINO.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.600
70%.

29:42.666 --> 29:44.300
BUT ABOUT 75% OF THE 16,000

29:44.366 --> 29:46.333
STUDENTS THAT GET IN THE GIFTED

29:46.400 --> 29:50.366
CLASSES ARE WHITE OR ASIAN.

29:50.433 --> 29:56.166
WE ALL A DOG IN THIS FIGHT.

29:56.233 --> 29:57.866
NOW THE INCOMING MAYOR,

29:57.933 --> 29:59.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ERIC ADAMS, WHO

29:59.066 --> 30:00.766
I LOVE, HE IS GOING TO -- SHE'S

30:00.833 --> 30:03.266
NOT GOING TO GET RID OF IT

30:03.333 --> 30:04.900
BECAUSE HIS POINT IS LET'S LIFT

30:04.966 --> 30:06.366
UP THE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T THERE

30:06.433 --> 30:08.966
INSTEAD OF GETTING RID OF THE

30:09.033 --> 30:11.066
WHOLE PROGRAM, THAT GOT TO BE A

30:11.133 --> 30:11.866
WHOLE TREND.

30:11.933 --> 30:13.000
IF A MINORITY GROUP ISN'T DOING

30:13.066 --> 30:14.433
AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE, THAT'S

30:14.500 --> 30:18.500
WHAT THEY TRY TO DO THE

30:18.566 --> 30:20.133
S.A.T.s, YOU HAVE WRITTEN

30:20.200 --> 30:21.166
ABOUT A RACIST MATH.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.900
>> MATH IS RACIST, THAT'S RIGHT.

30:23.966 --> 30:26.366
>> I TAKE THAT PERSONALLY,

30:26.433 --> 30:27.633
THAT'S MY CAMPAIGN SLOGAN.

30:27.700 --> 30:31.133
>> Bill: WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS

30:31.200 --> 30:32.833
COME OUT WITH THE GIFTED

30:32.900 --> 30:33.366
PROGRAM.

30:33.433 --> 30:35.166
THIS IS WHERE I AM, IF YOU SEE

30:35.233 --> 30:37.233
BLACK AND LATINO KIDS ARE HAVING

30:37.300 --> 30:38.866
TROUBLE WITH, SAY, STANDARDIZED

30:38.933 --> 30:40.866
TESTS OR THE TEST THEY GIVE

30:40.933 --> 30:43.700
GIFTED KIDS, THE QUESTION THAT

30:43.766 --> 30:44.533
SOMEBODY WOULD'VE ASKED WITH THE

30:44.600 --> 30:45.900
CAT EYE GLASSES SIPPING ME

30:45.966 --> 30:46.500
HARVEY WALL BANGER WOULD HAVE

30:46.566 --> 30:49.100
BEEN HOW DO WE GET THE KIDS

30:49.166 --> 30:51.200
BETTER AT THOSE TESTS?

30:51.266 --> 30:53.200
SOMEHOW TODAY THE IDEA IS LET'S

30:53.266 --> 30:54.333
ILLUMINATE THE TEST BECAUSE THE

30:54.400 --> 30:58.166
TEST IS RACIST.

30:58.233 --> 30:59.600
IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.

30:59.666 --> 31:01.400
IF YOU DECIDE THAT IT'S RACIST

31:01.466 --> 31:03.700
TO SUBMIT A BLACK KID TO A TEST

31:03.766 --> 31:06.633
OF COGNITIVE ABILITY, THEN YOU

31:06.700 --> 31:09.333
ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF COURT TO

31:09.400 --> 31:10.600
YELL AND SCREAM WHEN SOMETHING

31:10.666 --> 31:11.866
LIKE CHARLES MURRAY SAYS BLACK

31:11.933 --> 31:13.000
PEOPLE ARE LESS INTELLIGENT THAN

31:13.066 --> 31:13.300
OTHERS.

31:13.366 --> 31:16.066
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

31:16.133 --> 31:17.633
THE IDEA IS TO SEE HOW YOU CAN

31:17.700 --> 31:19.000
GET BLACK KIDS BETTER AT THE

31:19.066 --> 31:19.200
TESTS.

31:19.266 --> 31:21.633
[APPLAUSE]

31:21.700 --> 31:24.066
>> Bill: LIFT UP, NOT THROW

31:24.133 --> 31:24.666
OUT.

31:24.733 --> 31:26.000
ARE YOU DOWN WITH THAT?

31:26.066 --> 31:29.800
>> I AGREE WITH ERIC ADAMS THAT

31:29.866 --> 31:30.466
RETAINING THE GIFTED AND

31:30.533 --> 31:32.100
TALENTED PROGRAMS IS THE RIGHT

31:32.166 --> 31:32.833
APPROACH AND TRYING TO EXPAND

31:32.900 --> 31:35.566
THE OPPORTUNITY TWO RIGHT NOW IT

31:35.633 --> 31:37.800
IS A LITTLE BIT NARROW THE WAY

31:37.866 --> 31:39.733
ONE GETS INTO THESE GIFTED AND

31:39.800 --> 31:40.600
TALENTED PROGRAMS.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.133
I HAVE A SON IN PUBLIC SCHOOL

31:42.200 --> 31:45.233
AND THE TESTS ARE ADMINISTERED

31:45.300 --> 31:47.866
AT AGE 4.

31:47.933 --> 31:49.233
THAT'S NOT IDEAL AND YOU SHOULD

31:49.300 --> 31:51.633
HAVE DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS, HE

31:51.700 --> 31:52.700
SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN

31:52.766 --> 31:53.866
CONCENTRATED IN VARIOUS

31:53.933 --> 31:55.433
NEIGHBORHOODS TO ENSURE THE

31:55.500 --> 31:56.233
MAKEUP OF PEOPLE IN THESE

31:56.300 --> 31:57.800
PROGRAMS ACTUALLY IS CLOSER TO

31:57.866 --> 31:59.333
THE COMPOSITION OF THE CITY.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.900
>> Bill: WASN'T THERE A

32:00.966 --> 32:02.800
LAWSUIT AT HARVARD BECAUSE IF

32:02.866 --> 32:04.233
HARVARD HAD LEFT IN STUDENTS

32:04.300 --> 32:05.233
STRICTLY BY THE TEST SCORES, IT

32:05.300 --> 32:10.266
WOULD BE ABOUT 50% ASIAN.

32:10.333 --> 32:13.000
THE ASIANS DO VERY WELL.

32:13.066 --> 32:14.700
AND THEY CAN'T DO IT THAT WAY.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.533
THEY HAVE BEEN SUED, THAT WAS

32:18.600 --> 32:20.900
REAL RACISM, IN A WAY.

32:20.966 --> 32:23.166
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY

32:23.233 --> 32:23.800
ASIANS.

32:23.866 --> 32:24.966
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT HARVARD

32:25.033 --> 32:27.200
WAS SAYING, WE HAVE TO FIND A

32:27.266 --> 32:28.766
WAY NOT TO HAVE SO MANY ASIANS

32:28.833 --> 32:29.966
WHO ACTUALLY DO BETTER ON THE

32:30.033 --> 32:30.533
TESTS.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.966
>> IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE WHAT THEY

32:32.033 --> 32:33.000
SAID ABOUT JEWISH PEOPLE IN THE

32:33.066 --> 32:35.166
PAST AND IF YOU CONFRONT PEOPLE

32:35.233 --> 32:36.833
LIKE THAT, THERE'S THIS THING

32:36.900 --> 32:38.266
PEOPLE DO.

32:38.333 --> 32:38.966
THEY LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER

32:39.033 --> 32:40.500
WITH THIS DREAMY LOOK IN THEIR

32:40.566 --> 32:42.833
EYES AND THEY SAY IT'S

32:42.900 --> 32:43.133
COMPLICATED.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.166
THEN THEY START TALKING ABOUT

32:45.233 --> 32:46.366
SUCCESSION, THEY DON'T WANT YOU

32:46.433 --> 32:49.400
TO THINK ABOUT THE ISSUE.

32:49.466 --> 32:50.500
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE EXACT

32:50.566 --> 32:50.800
SAME THING.

32:50.866 --> 32:51.533
WE MUST CONFRONT THESE PEOPLE

32:51.600 --> 32:52.900
ABOUT THAT.

32:52.966 --> 32:56.766
[APPLAUSE]

32:56.833 --> 32:58.166
>> Bill: I SO ENJOY YOUR BOOK

32:58.233 --> 33:02.366
THAT HAS WOKEN THE TITLE, I'M

33:02.433 --> 33:05.733
READING THIS ARTICLE ABOUT WOKE

33:05.800 --> 33:06.600
HORROR.

33:06.666 --> 33:07.833
IT'S HALLOWEEN TIME, MY FAVORITE

33:07.900 --> 33:09.100
TIME OF THE YEAR, I LOVE

33:09.166 --> 33:12.700
HALLOWEEN TIME AND APPARENTLY

33:12.766 --> 33:14.900
"HALLOWEEN KILLS.

33:14.966 --> 33:19.366
"THANK GOD OUR BELOVED INDUSTRY

33:19.433 --> 33:20.666
IS DOING WELL, THIS IS KILLING

33:20.733 --> 33:21.566
AT THE BOX OFFICE.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.233
APPARENTLY IT HAS THINGS IN IT

33:23.300 --> 33:25.600
THAT ARE KIND OF WOKE AND SINCE

33:25.666 --> 33:27.800
THE MOVIE GET OUT WAS A BIG HIT,

33:27.866 --> 33:30.100
IT SET THE BAR THAT YOU CAN'T

33:30.166 --> 33:32.900
JUST HORRIFY, AND HAS TO BE WOKE

33:32.966 --> 33:34.600
AND HORRIFYING.

33:34.666 --> 33:36.200
WE GOT A HOLD OF SOME OF THE NEW

33:36.266 --> 33:37.200
TITLES COMING OUT, WOULD YOU

33:37.266 --> 33:40.833
LIKE TO SEE THEM?

33:40.900 --> 33:42.633
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

33:42.700 --> 33:43.866
MAN.

33:43.933 --> 33:49.333
SOME OF THESE HORROR MOVIES.

BRIDE OF CHUCKY IS PAID LESS

34:01.200 --> 34:07.300

[LAUGHTER]

34:07.633 --> 34:08.433
[APPLAUSE]

34:08.500 --> 34:16.766
THE HILLS HAVE PRIVILEGE.

DRACULA HAS RISEN THROUGH THE

[LAUGHTER]

35:00.900 --> 35:01.600
[APPLAUSE]

35:01.666 --> 35:03.266
WHAT A GREAT SEGUE NOW THAT WE

35:03.333 --> 35:04.133
HAVE ESTABLISHED THE WOKE TOPIC

35:04.200 --> 35:05.733
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING

35:05.800 --> 35:07.466
ON THIS WEEK WHEN EVERYBODY IS

35:07.533 --> 35:10.100
TALKING ABOUT, DAVE CHAPELLE'S

35:10.166 --> 35:13.200
SPECIAL, THE REACTION, NETFLIX,

35:13.266 --> 35:14.900
AND THE TRANS COMMUNITY.

35:14.966 --> 35:15.733
IF WE ESTABLISH RIGHT HERE AT

35:15.800 --> 35:18.633
THE BEGINNING THAT ALL THREE OF

35:18.700 --> 35:20.100
US OF ALL LAWS THAT PROTECT

35:20.166 --> 35:23.966
TRANS PEOPLE, THAT WE BELIEVE IN

35:24.033 --> 35:25.233
ALL THE DIGNITY AND EQUALITY AND

35:25.300 --> 35:26.600
RESPECT THAT CAN BE AFFORDED TO

35:26.666 --> 35:28.833
TRANS PEOPLE, CAN WE HAVE AN

35:28.900 --> 35:29.900
HONEST, FREE DISCUSSION ABOUT

35:29.966 --> 35:30.133
THIS?

35:30.200 --> 35:32.433
>> MANY PEOPLE DON'T THINK SO.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.066
>> Bill: THAT'S WHAT BOTHERS

35:33.133 --> 35:35.866
ME TO BEGIN WITH.

35:35.933 --> 35:39.300
THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE ONE TRUE

35:39.366 --> 35:41.433
OPINION, VERY APROPOS OF YOUR

35:41.500 --> 35:43.066
THEME, THERE IS THE ONE TRUE

35:43.133 --> 35:44.500
OPINION AND THERE ISN'T.

35:44.566 --> 35:47.500
THERE ISN'T ONE TRUE OPINION.

35:47.566 --> 35:48.766
I'M A FREE-SPEECH GUIDE.

35:48.833 --> 35:51.400
I'M TEAM DAVE BUT THAT DOESN'T

35:51.466 --> 35:53.500
MEAN I'M ANTI-TRANS.

35:53.566 --> 35:53.766
[APPLAUSE]

35:53.833 --> 35:55.233
WE CAN HAVE TWO THOUGHTS IN OUR

35:55.300 --> 35:56.000
HEAD AT THE SAME TIME, AM I

35:56.066 --> 35:59.266
RIGHT ABOUT THAT?

35:59.333 --> 36:02.233
>> BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.266
THERE'S A CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON

36:04.333 --> 36:07.166
WHO -- AND THE BOOK THAT I WROTE

36:07.233 --> 36:08.633
I HAVE TO MENTION EXPLICITLY

36:08.700 --> 36:14.066
ONCE, IT'S CALLED "WOKE RACISM

36:14.133 --> 36:14.333
RACISM" --

36:14.400 --> 36:15.166
>> Bill: DIDN'T I MENTION IT?

36:15.233 --> 36:18.433
>> I HAVE TO SAY IT TOO MY

36:18.500 --> 36:20.333
PUBLISHER -- WHAT A CERTAIN KIND

36:20.400 --> 36:22.533
OF PERSON THINKS IS WHAT WE HAVE

36:22.600 --> 36:24.200
TO HOLD FRONT AND CENTER IS

36:24.266 --> 36:25.933
BATTLING AN STRIKING BATTLE

36:26.000 --> 36:26.833
POSES AGAINST POWER

36:26.900 --> 36:27.366
DIFFERENTIALS AND THAT MUST

36:27.433 --> 36:30.966
CENTER EVERYTHING WE DO

36:31.033 --> 36:32.066
INTELLECTUALLY, ARTISTICALLY,

36:32.133 --> 36:32.833
MORALLY, THERE MIGHT BE SOME

36:32.900 --> 36:34.600
OTHER THINGS, YOU CAN BARBECUE

36:34.666 --> 36:35.166
NOW AND THEN.

36:35.233 --> 36:36.733
BUT THAT IS THE CENTER.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.600
IF YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT, YOU'RE

36:38.666 --> 36:40.300
NOT JUST SOMEBODY WHO'S

36:40.366 --> 36:42.200
ANNOYING, YOU ARE A MORAL AND

36:42.266 --> 36:43.866
YOU MUST BE DEFINED AS CREATED

36:43.933 --> 36:44.700
AND CHASED OUT OF THE PUBLIC

36:44.766 --> 36:45.000
SQUARE.

36:45.066 --> 36:46.633
THEY DON'T PUT IT IN THOSE WORDS

36:46.700 --> 36:48.500
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHAT

36:48.566 --> 36:50.066
THEY MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE UP

36:50.133 --> 36:50.433
AGAINST.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.400
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A SOME PEOPLE

36:51.466 --> 36:52.866
WHO THINK THERE IS ONE TRUTH,

36:52.933 --> 36:54.800
THEY THINK THEY HAVE FOUND THE

36:54.866 --> 36:59.500
FINAL SOLUTION, THEY THINK THEY

36:59.566 --> 37:03.233
ARE KANT.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.833
THEY AREN'T.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.200
>> Bill: KANT, THE

37:06.266 --> 37:06.500
PHILOSOPHER.

37:06.566 --> 37:07.866
[APPLAUSE]

37:07.933 --> 37:09.766
YOU WANT TO CONFUSE PEOPLE OUT

37:09.833 --> 37:12.833
THERE, EMMANUEL KANT.

37:12.900 --> 37:18.400
THE PHILOSOPHER.

37:18.466 --> 37:21.433
[LAUGHTER]

37:21.500 --> 37:24.066
>> I'M GOING TO LOSE MY JOB.

37:24.133 --> 37:25.633
>> Bill: NO YOU'RE NOT, I'M

37:25.700 --> 37:27.633
GOING TO LOSE MIND -- WE'RE ALL

37:27.700 --> 37:28.366
GOING TO LOSE HOURS.

37:28.433 --> 37:33.400
AS A PROFESSOR OF LANGUAGE,

37:33.466 --> 37:34.666
HERE'S WHAT I THOUGHT I WOULD

37:34.733 --> 37:35.600
GET YOU ON EVEN THOUGH IT'S

37:35.666 --> 37:38.966
GOING TO THE SUBJECT OF MY

37:39.033 --> 37:40.866
EDITORIAL NEXT WEEK BECAUSE IT'S

37:40.933 --> 37:42.366
A MUCH BIGGER SUBJECT THAN JUST

37:42.433 --> 37:43.066
THIS BUT THIS GETS AT IT.

37:43.133 --> 37:45.266
WORDS HAVE MEANING.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.866
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.500
WHEN I HEAR TRANSPHOBIC --

37:50.566 --> 37:54.966
PHOBIC HAS A MEANING, FEAR.

37:55.033 --> 37:56.633
I'M NOT TRANSPHOBIC IF I MERELY

37:56.700 --> 38:00.633
DISAGREE WITH YOU, IT'S NOT HAT

38:00.700 --> 38:00.833
HATE.

38:00.900 --> 38:01.366
ONE OF THE REACTIONS FROM

38:01.433 --> 38:02.233
SOMEONE WHO WORKED AT NETFLIX

38:02.300 --> 38:05.133
SAID THIS NOT AN ARGUMENT WITH

38:05.200 --> 38:06.633
TWO SIDES, RIGHT AWAY YOU LOST

38:06.700 --> 38:07.166
ME.

38:07.233 --> 38:08.333
IT IS AN ARGUMENT WITH TRANS

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE ALIVE AND

38:10.466 --> 38:12.066
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT US TO BE.

38:12.133 --> 38:14.866
THAT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.

38:14.933 --> 38:15.700
DAVE CHAPPELLE DOES NOT WANT YOU

38:15.766 --> 38:20.833
TO NOT BE ALIVE.

38:20.900 --> 38:25.200
[APPLAUSE]

38:25.266 --> 38:25.766
AND YOU'RE NOT AUTOMATICALLY

38:25.833 --> 38:28.900
RIGHT IF YOU'RE TRANS.

38:28.966 --> 38:31.933
YOU'RE COMPLETELY EQUAL, YOU'RE

38:32.000 --> 38:32.900
JUST NOT AUTOMATICALLY RIGHT AND

38:32.966 --> 38:35.933
IT DOESN'T BEHOOVE EVERYBODY TO

38:36.000 --> 38:38.366
GET THEIR MIND AROUND VERY NEW

38:38.433 --> 38:39.366
CHANGES.

38:39.433 --> 38:40.866
WE WERE A BOY AND GIRL FOR A

38:40.933 --> 38:43.800
VERY LONG TIME.

38:43.866 --> 38:46.266
IT'S ONLY BEEN TEN YEARS, HOW

38:46.333 --> 38:48.233
LONG HAVE WE HAD GAY MARRIAGE?

38:48.300 --> 38:48.966
TALK ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC VOTER,

38:49.033 --> 38:51.266
I'M SURE THERE'S A GUY IN OHIO

38:51.333 --> 38:54.000
GOING "I JUST GOT ON BOARD WITH

38:54.066 --> 38:54.866
GAY MARRIAGE, COULD YOU GIVE ME

38:54.933 --> 38:57.400
A MINUTE?"

38:57.466 --> 39:00.100
THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE NOT ANY

39:00.166 --> 39:01.833
GENDER WHEN WE ARE BORN IS VERY

39:01.900 --> 39:03.566
NEW AND VERY RADICAL, YOU'RE

39:03.633 --> 39:06.733
BORN AND IT'S JUMP BALL.

39:06.800 --> 39:10.166
YOU HAVE A PENIS, IT COULD MEAN

39:10.233 --> 39:12.633
YOU'RE A BOY.

39:12.700 --> 39:13.533
I'M NOT SURE I'M DOWN WITH ALL

39:13.600 --> 39:16.166
OF IT AND I'M NOT SURE I HAVE TO

39:16.233 --> 39:16.700
BE.

39:16.766 --> 39:18.800
>> DAVE WASN'T BATTLING POWER

39:18.866 --> 39:20.533
DIFFERENTIALS, HE WASN'T

39:20.600 --> 39:21.133
IMMEDIATELY ONBOARD AND THAT

39:21.200 --> 39:23.733
PERSON FROM OHIO NEEDS TO DO

39:23.800 --> 39:24.400
SOME LEARNING AND SOME

39:24.466 --> 39:25.566
ADJUSTING, BUT THAT MEANS YOU

39:25.633 --> 39:27.300
ARE A HERETIC AND YOU HAVE TO BE

39:27.366 --> 39:28.833
PUSHED OUT A WINDOW BECAUSE YOU

39:28.900 --> 39:31.233
ARE NOT BATTLING THE POWER

39:31.300 --> 39:31.700
DIFFERENTIALS.

39:31.766 --> 39:33.366
WHAT YOU SEE -- THERE'S ONE

39:33.433 --> 39:34.033
THING THIS IS.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.600
THESE PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO DO THIS

39:35.666 --> 39:37.700
ABOUT RACE, WHO DO THIS ABOUT

39:37.766 --> 39:39.300
TRANS, WHO DID THIS ABOUT

39:39.366 --> 39:40.100
ANYTHING THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES

39:40.166 --> 39:41.266
AHEAD OF THE CURVE.

39:41.333 --> 39:42.300
THEY THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES AS

39:42.366 --> 39:44.933
INDICATING SOME SORT OF HIGHER

39:45.000 --> 39:45.166
WISDOM.

39:45.233 --> 39:46.366
REALLY, IT'S A VERY SIMPLE WAY

39:46.433 --> 39:48.900
OF DOING THINGS, NO MATTER WHAT

39:48.966 --> 39:50.266
THEY ARE ARGUING ON THE BASIS OF

39:50.333 --> 39:52.433
THEY ARE TELLING US THE WAY WE

39:52.500 --> 39:53.333
THOUGHT ABOUT IT WHEN YOU ARE

39:53.400 --> 39:53.966
FIVE YEARS OLD IS THE PROPER WAY

39:54.033 --> 39:56.966
TO THINK OF IT.

39:57.033 --> 39:57.400
THAT DOESN'T WORK!

39:57.466 --> 40:00.833
NEVER WILL.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.100
[APPLAUSE]

40:02.166 --> 40:04.533
>> YOU HAVE BEEN A COMEDIAN,

40:04.600 --> 40:06.700
BEING A COMEDIAN SEEMS A GET

40:06.766 --> 40:07.000
TOUGH JOB.

40:07.066 --> 40:09.166
I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT

40:09.233 --> 40:10.866
COMEDIAN'S PRIMARY ROLE IS TO

40:10.933 --> 40:12.433
ENTERTAIN AND SOMETIMES TO MAKE

40:12.500 --> 40:12.933
US THINK.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.166
BUT NO ONE THINKS IT'S A

40:14.233 --> 40:15.900
COMEDIAN'S ROLE TO TELL US HOW

40:15.966 --> 40:18.266
TO THINK OR WHAT TO THINK AND

40:18.333 --> 40:20.666
ATTRIBUTING THAT ROLE TO DAVE OR

40:20.733 --> 40:22.533
ANY OTHER COMEDIAN DOESN'T SERVE

40:22.600 --> 40:25.033
ART, THE ARTIST, OR SOCIETY AT

40:25.100 --> 40:25.200
ALL.

40:25.266 --> 40:33.200
[APPLAUSE]

40:33.266 --> 40:34.600
>> Bill: I WAS GOING TO READ

40:34.666 --> 40:35.200
SOME OF THESE REVIEWS, I WAS

40:35.266 --> 40:38.033
GOING TO READ THIS ONE FROM NPR.

40:38.100 --> 40:42.833
THE REVIEWS FROM THE CRITICS AT

40:42.900 --> 40:44.133
VARIANCE WITH THE AUDIENCE.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.000
ROTTEN TOMATOES, THAT IS AN

40:46.066 --> 40:48.033
AMALGAM OF REVIEWS, IN THIS CASE

40:48.100 --> 40:48.700
SEVEN.

40:48.766 --> 40:50.300
'S SPECIAL GOT A 43%.

40:50.366 --> 40:52.533
AUDIENCE?

40:52.600 --> 40:52.933
95.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.066
IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE

40:55.133 --> 40:58.566
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN REAL

40:58.633 --> 40:58.900
PEOPLE --

40:58.966 --> 41:01.000
>> WE ARE SEEING THIS AGAIN AND

41:01.066 --> 41:02.933
AGAIN.

41:03.000 --> 41:03.966
DEFUND THE POLICE, SO

41:04.033 --> 41:05.266
SOPHISTICATED PERSON AND A

41:05.333 --> 41:07.100
PERSON LIVING IN A DANGEROUS

41:07.166 --> 41:08.833
NEIGHBORHOOD DOESN'T WANT IT AND

41:08.900 --> 41:11.200
THERE ARE MORE OF THEM AND THERE

41:11.266 --> 41:11.933
ARE PEOPLE WEARING T-SHIRTS

41:12.000 --> 41:14.833
SAYING THIEF ON THE POLICE, OR

41:14.900 --> 41:17.300
LATINX, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

41:17.366 --> 41:18.366
MAKING ANY INROADS INTO THE

41:18.433 --> 41:20.800
COMMUNITIES WHERE MOST LATINX

41:20.866 --> 41:21.300
PEOPLE LIVE.

41:21.366 --> 41:24.366
YOU HAVE THIS EDUCATED DIALECT

41:24.433 --> 41:24.833
WAY OF THINKING.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.966
THAT'S THE CASE HERE WHERE ALL

41:27.033 --> 41:29.133
OF THESE PEOPLE I THINK TO GET

41:29.200 --> 41:31.533
BACK TO THE SIMPLICITY IDEA,

41:31.600 --> 41:32.166
THEY SEE THAT DAVE CHAPPELLE IS

41:32.233 --> 41:36.533
A COMEDIAN, LAYERS OF WIT AND

41:36.600 --> 41:37.533
IRONY AND ATTITUDE GOING ON AND

41:37.600 --> 41:39.666
INSTEAD WE ARE TOLD TO JUST READ

41:39.733 --> 41:40.933
IT AS IF IT WAS THE THREE BEARS

41:41.000 --> 41:45.433
AND WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT IS

41:45.500 --> 41:47.400
SOPHISTICATED WHEN REALLY THAT

41:47.466 --> 41:49.433
MEANS THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO

41:49.500 --> 41:51.366
ANNOYED THAT ANYBODY SAYS SOME

41:51.433 --> 41:53.033
WORDS OR EXPRESSES SOME IDEAS

41:53.100 --> 41:55.666
ARE SAYING THAT MOST OF AMERICA

41:55.733 --> 41:56.833
AREN'T SOPHISTICATED.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.833
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED, THEY

41:58.900 --> 41:59.400
ARE ARGUING ON THE BASIS OF

41:59.466 --> 42:01.700
DISEMPOWERED PEOPLE.

42:01.766 --> 42:03.266
>> Bill: THERE'S A CONNECTION

42:03.333 --> 42:03.833
BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH

42:03.900 --> 42:06.700
WHAT HE HAS SAID WHICH I DON'T

42:06.766 --> 42:08.066
THINK IS TRANSPHOBIC, A LOT OF

42:08.133 --> 42:10.800
THE SPECIAL IS HOW HE HAS

42:10.866 --> 42:12.833
FRIENDSHIP WITH A TRANS PERSON

42:12.900 --> 42:14.000
WHO IS HIS OPENING ACT BUT IT'S

42:14.066 --> 42:16.400
GOING TO LEAD TO VIOLENCE.

42:16.466 --> 42:19.533
BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN UPTICK IN

42:19.600 --> 42:20.166
VIOLENCE AS THERE WAS WITH

42:20.233 --> 42:20.900
ASIAN-AMERICANS IN THE LAST

42:20.966 --> 42:23.633
COUPLE OF YEARS.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.066
OF COURSE, WE CONDEMN THIS.

42:25.133 --> 42:27.066
WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

42:27.133 --> 42:27.766
TO STOP IT.

42:27.833 --> 42:29.300
BUT I DON'T THINK IT DAVE

42:29.366 --> 42:31.333
CHAPELLE'S SPECIAL HAS ANYTHING

42:31.400 --> 42:32.933
TO DO WITH IT.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.600
LET ME READ -- NPR SAID IT

42:35.666 --> 42:38.066
SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS USING WHITE

42:38.133 --> 42:38.800
PRIVILEGE TO EXCUSE HIS

42:38.866 --> 42:40.833
HOMOPHOBIA AND TRANSFER WILL BE

42:40.900 --> 42:41.400
AT.

42:41.466 --> 42:43.200
WEIGHTS, NOW DAVE CHAPPELLE CAN

42:43.266 --> 42:44.833
HAVE WHITE PRIVILEGE?

42:44.900 --> 42:49.000
I'M REALLY CONFUSED NOW.

42:49.066 --> 42:53.866
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT TO ME?

42:53.933 --> 42:56.233
WHERE DOES THIS INSANITY COME

42:56.300 --> 42:56.600
FROM?

42:56.666 --> 42:58.433
I'VE DONE THREE EDITORIALS ON

42:58.500 --> 43:01.466
WHITE LOATHING, IT'S LIKE A KINK

43:01.533 --> 43:02.500
TWO WHITE PEOPLE NEEDING TO HATE

43:02.566 --> 43:03.300
THEMSELVES.

43:03.366 --> 43:05.200
IT'S LIKE THE GUY WHO LIKES TO

43:05.266 --> 43:06.966
BE WEPT AND TOLD HE'S A WORM BY

43:07.033 --> 43:12.200
SOME WOMAN WITH HER HIGH HEEL IN

43:12.266 --> 43:15.100
HIS NECK, ISN'T IT?

43:15.166 --> 43:16.933
>> IT'S DAVE CHAPPELLE AS AN

43:17.000 --> 43:18.966
OREO COOKIE TWO >> IS THAT WHAT

43:19.033 --> 43:19.866
THEY ARE SAYING?

43:19.933 --> 43:21.466
>> IF HE IS ASSUMING WHITE

43:21.533 --> 43:22.900
PRIVILEGE.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.200
>> WHERE THIS GOES IS THERE IS A

43:26.266 --> 43:27.033
RELIGION AND SOME PEOPLE TELL ME

43:27.100 --> 43:28.833
I SHOULDN'T CALL IT THAT BUT YOU

43:28.900 --> 43:29.133
KNOW WHAT'S?

43:29.200 --> 43:32.100
IT'S A RELIGION.

43:32.166 --> 43:34.466
THE RELIGION IS ONE IN WHICH YOU

43:34.533 --> 43:35.533
ARE SUPPOSED TO SHOW YOU KNOW

43:35.600 --> 43:39.333
WHAT RACISM IS AND IN THIS

43:39.400 --> 43:40.166
RELIGION, THERE'S ORIGINAL SIN,

43:40.233 --> 43:41.433
THERE'S WHITE PRIVILEGE AND YOU

43:41.500 --> 43:42.900
CAN NEVER GET PAST THAT EVEN IF

43:42.966 --> 43:44.966
YOU ARE LIVING IN A BUCKET AND

43:45.033 --> 43:46.933
MISERABLE AND HAVE ONE LEG, YOU

43:47.000 --> 43:49.166
STILL ARE PRIVILEGED IF YOU ARE

43:49.233 --> 43:50.066
A WHITE PERSON.

43:50.133 --> 43:52.666
AND YOUR JOB IS JUST TO SIT IN

43:52.733 --> 43:54.566
THE BATHTUB AND EXAMINE YOURSELF

43:54.633 --> 43:55.600
OR YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE UNTIL

43:55.666 --> 43:57.400
ONE DAY YOU DROP DEAD.

43:57.466 --> 44:02.666
IT'S ORIGINAL SIN.

44:02.733 --> 44:03.600
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

44:03.666 --> 44:04.400
[APPLAUSE]

44:04.466 --> 44:05.600
ALL OF THAT HELPS ME.

44:05.666 --> 44:08.433
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS, IT'S A

44:08.500 --> 44:09.200
RELIGIOUS MATTER THAT MEANS

44:09.266 --> 44:09.966
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE

44:10.033 --> 44:13.233
SENSE AND SO DAVE CHAPPELLE HAS

44:13.300 --> 44:15.166
WHITE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE HE SAYS

44:15.233 --> 44:16.400
SOME THINGS THAT MAKES SOME

44:16.466 --> 44:16.833
PEOPLE --

44:16.900 --> 44:17.666
>> Bill: IT'S AMAZING WHAT WAS

44:17.733 --> 44:20.266
LOST AND THIS IS AMID REPORTS

44:20.333 --> 44:21.733
LAST FEW DAYS ABOUT THIS WALKOUT

44:21.800 --> 44:24.600
AT NETFLIX OF THE TRANS WORKERS

44:24.666 --> 44:25.800
THERE, NOBODY MENTIONED WOW.

44:25.866 --> 44:28.900
APPARENTLY NETFLIX HAS A LOT OF

44:28.966 --> 44:30.666
TRANS PEOPLE WORKING THERE.

44:30.733 --> 44:32.666
ENOUGH FOR A GIANT WALKOUT,

44:32.733 --> 44:34.833
ISN'T THAT A STORY IN ITSELF?

44:34.900 --> 44:36.633
DOES NOT SAY THIS COMPANY IS

44:36.700 --> 44:38.833
PRETTY ENLIGHTENED TO BEGIN

44:38.900 --> 44:39.366
WITH?

44:39.433 --> 44:40.066
SOMETIMES YOU CAN ASK FOR TOO

44:40.133 --> 44:44.033
MUCH EVEN IF YOU ARE A MINORITY.

44:44.100 --> 44:46.633
CRAZY TALK, I KNOW.

44:46.700 --> 44:47.266
>> JUST WINDOW DRESSING, REALLY

44:47.333 --> 44:50.666
A THING.

44:50.733 --> 44:51.300
>> Bill: THIRD PARTY BEFORE WE

44:51.366 --> 44:52.800
RUN OUT OF TIME.

44:52.866 --> 44:55.166
WHY DO YOU WANT TO START A THIRD

44:55.233 --> 44:56.833
PARTY?

44:56.900 --> 44:59.600
THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED,

44:59.666 --> 45:02.500
SPEEFORTY AND BIDEN NOW ARE AT

45:02.566 --> 45:03.366
4040 IN THE POLLS, DO YOU REALLY

45:03.433 --> 45:05.800
WANT TO BE RALPH NADER WHO

45:05.866 --> 45:07.033
THROWS THE ELECTION TO

45:07.100 --> 45:07.633
DONALD TRUMP?

45:07.700 --> 45:08.466
>> I'M FOCUSED ON WHAT'S ALREADY

45:08.533 --> 45:11.400
WORKING IN SOME PARTS OF THE

45:11.466 --> 45:13.600
COUNTRY.

45:13.666 --> 45:14.833
WHAT DO I MEAN?

45:14.900 --> 45:15.400
LISA MURKOWSKI IS THE ONLY

45:15.466 --> 45:16.866
REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO VOTED TO

45:16.933 --> 45:18.400
IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO UP

45:18.466 --> 45:21.166
FOR REELECTION IN 2022.

45:21.233 --> 45:22.600
HER APPROVAL RATING AMONG

45:22.666 --> 45:23.866
ALASKAN REPUBLICANS NOW STANDS

45:23.933 --> 45:24.833
AT 6%.

45:24.900 --> 45:25.900
THAT'S WHY SO FEW REPUBLICANS

45:25.966 --> 45:27.366
ARE WILLING TO STAND UP AND

45:27.433 --> 45:31.000
DISAGREE WITH TRUMP.

45:31.066 --> 45:33.666
ALASKA LAST YEAR CHANGED ITS

45:33.733 --> 45:34.933
PROCESS FROM PARTY PRIMARIES

45:35.000 --> 45:36.566
WHERE SENATOR MURKOWSKI WOULD BE

45:36.633 --> 45:38.166
SUBJECT TO THE 10-20% MOST

45:38.233 --> 45:40.733
PARTISAN VOTERS IN ALASKA TO

45:40.800 --> 45:42.166
OPEN PRIMARIES AND RANKED CHOICE

45:42.233 --> 45:43.600
VOTING WHICH ALLOWS THE SENATOR

45:43.666 --> 45:45.533
TO APPEAL TO 50.1% OF THE

45:45.600 --> 45:48.366
GENERAL POPULATION.

45:48.433 --> 45:48.900
>> Bill: SHORT OF THAT YOU

45:48.966 --> 45:52.533
WON'T HAVE A THIRD PARTY?

45:52.600 --> 45:54.933
>> IF THE PLAN IS TO LINE UP OUR

45:55.000 --> 45:56.533
LEGISLATIVE SENATORS WITH US AS

45:56.600 --> 45:59.466
OPPOSED TO THAT TEND TO MAKE 20%

45:59.533 --> 46:01.900
OF EXTREME PARTISANS, BOTH

46:01.966 --> 46:02.633
POLARIZATION AND FOR COMPROMISE

46:02.700 --> 46:04.100
TO BE COMPLETELY ANATHEMA AND

46:04.166 --> 46:05.300
CONGRESS YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS

46:05.366 --> 46:06.733
HAPPEN ON A STATE-BY-STATE LEVEL

46:06.800 --> 46:08.666
IN RED, PURPLE, AND BLUE STATES

46:08.733 --> 46:10.633
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT AS A

46:10.700 --> 46:12.066
MEMBER OF THE CURRENT PARTY.

46:12.133 --> 46:15.600
>> Bill: HAVE A PICTURE IN

46:15.666 --> 46:16.966
2004 OF MICHAEL MOORE AND

46:17.033 --> 46:18.533
MYSELF, WE WERE BEGGING RALPH

46:18.600 --> 46:20.500
NADER NOT TO RUN AND THROW THE

46:20.566 --> 46:21.766
ELECTION TO GEORGE W. BUSH, I

46:21.833 --> 46:23.933
JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET

46:24.000 --> 46:24.566
ON MY KNEES LIKE I DID FOR

46:24.633 --> 46:26.400
MICHAEL MOORE.

46:26.466 --> 46:28.600
>> I'M FOCUSED ON 2022 BECAUSE

46:28.666 --> 46:29.733
THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS,

46:29.800 --> 46:31.366
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO DO AS

46:31.433 --> 46:32.166
MUCH WORK AS POSSIBLE.

46:32.233 --> 46:34.366
WE ARE AT A POINT IN AMERICAN

46:34.433 --> 46:37.366
LIFE OR 62% OF AMERICANS DO WANT

46:37.433 --> 46:39.300
AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DUOPOLY.

46:39.366 --> 46:40.700
>> Bill: THEY SAY THAT --

46:40.766 --> 46:42.400
>> YOUR ARGUMENT YOU MADE A

46:42.466 --> 46:44.033
COUPLE WEEKS AGO IT SHOWS JUST

46:44.100 --> 46:46.933
HOW SUBJECT TO AUTHORITARIANISM

46:47.000 --> 46:49.500
OUR PURPLE PARTY SYSTEM IS, IF

46:49.566 --> 46:52.800
ONE PARTY SUCCUMBS TO BAD

46:52.866 --> 46:54.200
LEADERSHIP, THERE IS NO

46:54.266 --> 46:54.833
SAFEGUARD.

46:54.900 --> 46:55.566
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WOULD BE

46:55.633 --> 46:56.233
SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED THAT WE

46:56.300 --> 46:57.633
ARE DEALING WITH THIS, IF YOU

46:57.700 --> 46:58.966
LOOK AROUND THE WORLD, THE U.K.,

46:59.033 --> 47:02.966
FIVE PARTIES, GERMANY, SEVEN

47:03.033 --> 47:04.466
PARTIES TWO >> Bill: THAT'S

47:04.533 --> 47:05.133
NOT OUR CONSTITUTION.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.100
>> IF ONE PARTY LOST ITS MIND

47:07.166 --> 47:08.433
AND WOULDN'T BE AN EXIT

47:08.500 --> 47:08.833
ESSENTIAL THREATS.

47:08.900 --> 47:11.200
>> Bill: WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

47:11.266 --> 47:11.433
SYSTEM.

47:11.500 --> 47:16.900
>> THAT IS THE MISSION.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.466
>> Bill: THANK YOU GUYS,

47:18.533 --> 47:20.833
YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT PANEL, IT'S

47:20.900 --> 47:26.466
TIME FOR NEW RULES!

47:26.533 --> 47:26.933
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

47:27.000 --> 47:27.800
NEW RULE: IF THE NEW DELTA

47:27.866 --> 47:28.700
VARIANT, DELTA PLUS, MEANS WE

47:28.766 --> 47:30.333
ALL HAVE TO GO BACK INTO

47:30.400 --> 47:31.500
LOCKDOWN AGAIN FED-EX HAS TO

47:31.566 --> 47:32.600
MERGE WITH EX-LAX.

47:32.666 --> 47:35.233
AND BECOME FED-EX-LAX.

47:35.300 --> 47:36.266
FOR WHEN YOU'RE SO LONELY,

47:36.333 --> 47:37.366
GETTING A PACKAGE MAKES YOU SHIT

47:37.433 --> 47:44.233
YOURSELF.

47:44.300 --> 47:44.833
[LAUGHTER]

47:44.900 --> 47:45.466

47:55.866 --> 47:57.133

47:57.200 --> 47:57.866
GOODNESS THAT SAYS, "MY STUDENT

47:57.933 --> 48:05.733
LOANS CAME IN."

48:05.800 --> 48:06.000
[LAUGHTER]

48:06.066 --> 48:06.600
LOOK FOR IT, IN THE BOX THAT'S

48:06.666 --> 48:11.933
JUST LIKE TAMPONS.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.433
[LAUGHTER]

48:13.500 --> 48:14.900
NEW RULE: NOW THAT KANYE WEST

48:14.966 --> 48:15.933
HAS TAKEN TO WEARING THIS MASK

48:16.000 --> 48:17.400
AT THE AIRPORT, SOMEONE HAS TO

48:17.466 --> 48:18.000
TAKE HIM ASIDE AND EXPLAIN THE

48:18.066 --> 48:19.933
PURPOSE OF A DISGUISE IS TO MAKE

48:20.000 --> 48:28.266
FEWER PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU.

48:28.333 --> 48:28.966
[LAUGHTER]

48:29.033 --> 48:29.233
[APPLAUSE]

48:29.300 --> 48:31.300
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE JOE NOBODY.

48:31.366 --> 48:32.266
YOU LOOK LIKE TRUMP BEFORE HE

48:32.333 --> 48:38.766
GOES INTO HAIR AND MAKE-UP.

48:38.833 --> 48:42.066
[LAUGHTER]

48:42.133 --> 48:43.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:43.800 --> 48:44.333
NEW RULE: STOP ASKING ME IF I

48:44.400 --> 48:44.900
WANT TO DONATE TO A CHARITY

48:44.966 --> 48:45.533
EVERY TIME I CHECK OUT AT YOUR

48:45.600 --> 48:46.133
STORE.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.533
I JUST WANT TO GET IN AND GET

48:48.600 --> 48:49.633
OUT OF THE PETSMART WITHOUT YOU

48:49.700 --> 48:50.700
GLARING AT ME FOR PRESSING "NOT

48:57.900 --> 48:58.766
SAVE THE PUPPIES, I'LL DONATE TO

48:58.833 --> 48:59.833

SELLS SHOCK COLLARS IN AISLE 12.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.900
NEW RULE: NOW THAT CHIPOTLE IS

49:11.966 --> 49:13.366
MAKING COSMETICS, INCLUDING A

49:13.433 --> 49:14.833
12-COLOR EYESHADOW PALETTE

49:14.900 --> 49:15.700
INSPIRED BY RICE, GUACAMOLE, AND

49:15.766 --> 49:16.900
SALSA -- THEY HAVE TO LEAN INTO

49:16.966 --> 49:17.700
THEIR REPUTATION WITH THE

49:17.766 --> 49:19.500
SLOGAN: "CHIPOTLE COSMETICS --

[LAUGHTER]

49:26.366 --> 49:30.566
[APPLAUSE]

49:30.633 --> 49:31.866
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

49:31.933 --> 49:33.266
AMERICANS MUST ANSWER THE

49:33.333 --> 49:34.300
QUESTION POSED ON TWITTER LAST

49:34.366 --> 49:36.100
WEEK BY REPRESENTATIVE MARJORIE

49:36.166 --> 49:37.900
TAYLOR GREENE: "SHOULD AMERICA

49:37.966 --> 49:40.066
HAVE A NATIONAL DIVORCE?"

49:40.133 --> 49:41.133
NOW, I DON'T THINK MARJORIE

49:41.200 --> 49:43.066
TAYLOR GREENE SHOULD REALLY BE A

49:43.133 --> 49:44.600
REPRESENTATIVE AT ALL -- SHE'S

49:44.666 --> 49:45.500
THE HOUSE YOU TELL YOUR KIDS TO

49:45.566 --> 49:55.433
AVOID ON HALLOWEEN.

49:55.500 --> 49:56.333
[LAUGHTER]

49:56.400 --> 49:56.600
[APPLAUSE]

49:56.666 --> 49:57.233
BUT HER QUESTION DOES REPRESENT

49:57.300 --> 49:57.766
THE THINKING OF A LOT OF

49:57.833 --> 49:58.633
AMERICANS.

49:58.700 --> 50:00.033
ON BOTH SIDES.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.133
BEN SHAPIRO FLOATED THE IDEA

50:01.200 --> 50:02.433
THAT OUR "BEST HOPE" NOW IS A

50:02.500 --> 50:04.500
"FRIENDLY SEPARATION" OF STATES.

50:04.566 --> 50:06.533
66% OF REPUBLICANS IN THE SOUTH

50:06.600 --> 50:09.266
SAY THEY'D SUPPORT SECESSION TO

50:09.333 --> 50:11.700
JOIN A NEW CONFEDERACY.

50:11.766 --> 50:14.066
41% OF BIDEN VOTERS WANT TO

50:14.133 --> 50:16.833
SECEDE.

50:16.900 --> 50:18.633
I MENTIONED THAT IN THIS SPACE

50:18.700 --> 50:20.333
ON OUR LAST SHOW IN MY EDITORIAL

50:20.400 --> 50:21.300
ABOUT HOW TRUMP IS, RIGHT NOW,

50:21.366 --> 50:22.933
BEHIND THE SCENES, SPENDING

50:23.000 --> 50:24.800
EVERY WAKING MOMENT MAKING THE

50:24.866 --> 50:26.166
CHANGES NEEDED TO REALLY STEAL

50:26.233 --> 50:29.233
THE ELECTION NEXT TIME.

50:29.300 --> 50:30.733
BECAUSE IT'S EITHER THAT OR

50:30.800 --> 50:33.166
TRYING TO WIN VOTERS WITH IDEAS.

50:33.233 --> 50:40.800
HAHAHAHAHA!

50:40.866 --> 50:41.133
[LAUGHTER]

50:41.200 --> 50:42.066
[APPLAUSE]

50:42.133 --> 50:43.633
A LOT OF PEOPLE HIT ME UP AFTER

50:43.700 --> 50:45.366
THAT EDITORIAL AND SAID I SCARED

50:45.433 --> 50:46.533
THE SHIT OUT OF THEM.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.433
GOOD.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.266
BECAUSE NOW THE QUESTION THEY'RE

50:50.333 --> 50:52.066
ASKING IS "WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT

50:52.133 --> 50:53.866
THIS SLOW MOVING COUP?"

50:53.933 --> 50:56.000
GREAT QUESTION.

50:56.066 --> 50:58.933
AND HERE'S THE ANSWER MANY WON'T

50:59.000 --> 51:00.700
LIKE: IF WE WANT TO HALT THIS

51:00.766 --> 51:01.333
DESCENT INTO CIVIL WAR, WE HAVE

51:01.400 --> 51:06.566
TO STOP HATING EACH OTHER.

51:06.633 --> 51:10.033
[APPLAUSE]

51:10.100 --> 51:12.266
AND THE REASON I SAY MANY WON'T

51:12.333 --> 51:13.900
LIKE THAT ANSWER IS BECAUSE THE

51:13.966 --> 51:15.533
ACT OF HATING PEOPLE YOU DON'T

51:15.600 --> 51:18.333
EXACTLY AGREE WITH HAS BECOME SO

51:18.400 --> 51:20.033
INGRAINED, SO ROUTINE, FOR SO

51:20.100 --> 51:21.000
MANY PEOPLE, I THINK IF THEY

51:21.066 --> 51:23.066
STOPPED, THEY'D MISS IT.

51:23.133 --> 51:25.000
IT'S BECOME SO NORMALIZED NOW,

51:25.066 --> 51:26.133
WE DON'T EVEN NOTICE HOW OFTEN

51:26.200 --> 51:27.266
SOMEONE ONLINE IS WISHING

51:27.333 --> 51:29.333
SOMEONE DEAD.

51:29.400 --> 51:31.333
ANYONE WE DISAGREE WITH -- ABOUT

51:31.400 --> 51:33.200
ANYTHING -- IS EVIL INCARNATE

51:33.266 --> 51:34.266
AND EVERY ARGUMENT GOES FROM

51:34.333 --> 51:36.800
ZERO TO HOMICIDE.

51:36.866 --> 51:38.833
IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE ABOUT

51:38.900 --> 51:39.933
SOMETHING CONSEQUENTIAL: YOU

51:40.000 --> 51:40.833
INSULTED GOSSIP GIRL?

51:40.900 --> 51:46.733
PREPARE TO DIE.

51:46.800 --> 51:47.000
[LAUGHTER]

51:47.066 --> 51:48.166
THERE'S A MOMENT IN MY STAND-UP

51:48.233 --> 51:49.333
ACT THESE DAYS WHERE I ASK THE

51:49.400 --> 51:51.766
AUDIENCE -- RHETORICALLY -- WHAT

51:51.833 --> 51:52.900
SHOULD HAPPEN TO ALL OF THE

51:52.966 --> 51:54.766
PEOPLE WHO ENABLED TRUMP WHEN HE

51:54.833 --> 51:56.466
WAS IN OFFICE -- AND ABOUT HALF

51:56.533 --> 51:57.200
THE TIME SOMEONE SHOUTS OUT

51:57.266 --> 51:58.900
"KILL THEM."

51:58.966 --> 52:02.200
OR "HANG THEM."

52:02.266 --> 52:04.233
BESIDES THE FACT THAT WISHING

52:04.300 --> 52:06.066
PEOPLE DEAD IS A TERRIBLE PLACE

52:06.133 --> 52:08.900
FOR YOUR MIND TO BE, IF YOU'RE

52:08.966 --> 52:10.000
WISHING THEM DEAD, YOU CAN BE

52:10.066 --> 52:11.566
SURE THEY'RE WISHING YOU DEAD.

52:11.633 --> 52:13.433
YOU WANT A REAL WAR, LIBERALS?

52:13.500 --> 52:14.666
REALLY?

52:14.733 --> 52:15.500
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA WIN THE

52:15.566 --> 52:17.200
"I WANT YOU DEAD" WAR?

52:17.266 --> 52:19.866
YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE GONNA LOSE.

52:19.933 --> 52:21.000
THEY HAVE WAY MORE GUNS AND THEY

52:21.066 --> 52:23.133
KNOW HOW TO USE THEM.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.000
AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, NO ONE

52:25.066 --> 52:25.600
CAN DO HATE LIKE A RIGHT-WING

52:25.666 --> 52:34.433
CONSERVATIVE.

52:34.500 --> 52:35.333
[LAUGHTER]

52:35.400 --> 52:35.600
[APPLAUSE]

52:35.666 --> 52:36.433
THIS PAST SATURDAY I WAS IN THE

52:36.500 --> 52:37.233
GREAT CITY OF PITTSBURGH, PA,

52:37.300 --> 52:38.566
AND THE MAN WHO DROVE ME IN FROM

52:38.633 --> 52:40.033
THE AIRPORT WAS FROM BOSNIA.

52:40.100 --> 52:41.600
HE WAS THERE IN SARAJEVO IN 1984

52:41.666 --> 52:43.833
WHEN THEY HAD THE OLYMPICS, AND

52:43.900 --> 52:45.066
HE LEFT SOME TIME AFTER THAT

52:45.133 --> 52:45.766
CITY BECAME A WAR-TORN

52:45.833 --> 52:49.133
HELLSCAPE.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.700
AND HE SAID TO ME: "WHAT I AM

52:50.766 --> 52:51.933
SEEING HAPPENING HERE NOW IS

52:52.000 --> 52:53.100
EXACTLY WHAT I SAW IN BOSNIA

52:53.166 --> 52:55.433
THEN.

52:55.500 --> 52:56.966
NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS WHO DESPISE

52:57.033 --> 52:58.533
EACH OTHER."

52:58.600 --> 52:59.800
HE WAS TELLING ME THAT HATE ON

52:59.866 --> 53:01.866
THIS LEVEL CAN ONLY BE SUSTAINED

53:01.933 --> 53:03.500
FOR SO LONG BEFORE BECOMING

53:03.566 --> 53:06.300
ACTUAL WAR.

53:06.366 --> 53:09.233
LAST YEAR A WAREHOUSE BLEW UP IN

53:09.300 --> 53:10.733
BEIRUT, LEBANON.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.533
EVERYONE AGREED IT WAS AN

53:12.600 --> 53:13.800
ACCIDENT -- BUT LAST WEEK, THERE

53:13.866 --> 53:15.600
WAS A MARCH CALLING FOR THE

53:15.666 --> 53:18.233
REMOVAL OF THE JUDGE

53:18.300 --> 53:19.633
INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT, AND

53:19.700 --> 53:21.166
IT TURNED INTO A STREET FIGHT

53:21.233 --> 53:24.866
WITH AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND

53:24.933 --> 53:26.366
ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES.

53:26.433 --> 53:27.000
OVER THAT MOST EMOTIONAL OF ALL

53:27.066 --> 53:29.300
ISSUES, WAREHOUSE SAFETY.

53:29.366 --> 53:31.233
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE DESPISE EACH

53:31.300 --> 53:31.966
OTHER, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

53:32.033 --> 53:33.700
THE "ISSUES" ARE.

53:33.766 --> 53:35.733
WHEN SOMEONE HATES YOU, THEY

53:35.800 --> 53:37.733
DON'T HEAR THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT

53:37.800 --> 53:38.833
YOU'RE SAYING, LET ALONE WANT TO

53:38.900 --> 53:41.166
WORK WITH YOU ON AN "ISSUE."

53:41.233 --> 53:43.566
TODAY'S REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE

53:43.633 --> 53:47.600
ISSUES -- OH, THEY HAVE ISSUES.

53:47.666 --> 53:47.866
[LAUGHTER]

53:47.933 --> 53:49.066

53:49.133 --> 53:49.366
TO HAVE.

53:49.433 --> 53:51.833
BALANCED BUDGET?

53:51.900 --> 53:53.200
THEY CARE ABOUT THAT ABOUT AS

53:53.266 --> 53:54.466
MUCH AS THEY CARE ABOUT THE NEW

53:54.533 --> 54:01.466
SEASON OF RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE.

54:04.066 --> 54:05.233
OBAMACARE WASN'T A HORRIBLE OR

54:05.300 --> 54:06.533
RADICAL POLICY -- IT WAS

54:06.600 --> 54:08.533
DESPERATELY NEEDED BY MANY OF

54:08.600 --> 54:11.700
THE PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT IT.

54:11.766 --> 54:13.533
BUT IT CAME FROM THE PEOPLE THEY

54:13.600 --> 54:16.466
HATED.

54:16.533 --> 54:17.600
DEMOCRATS KEEP THINKING THEY CAN

54:17.666 --> 54:19.733
WIN OVER VOTERS WHO HATE THEM

54:19.800 --> 54:22.033
WITH BETTER POLICIES.

54:22.100 --> 54:24.000
YOU'RE DREAMING.

54:24.066 --> 54:25.000
THEY'RE ALWAYS ASKING "WHY DO

54:25.066 --> 54:25.900
REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST THEIR

54:25.966 --> 54:26.700
ECONOMIC INTERESTS?"

54:26.766 --> 54:31.533
BECAUSE THEY HATE YOU.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.433
COMEDIANS KNOW THIS SYNDROME

54:32.500 --> 54:34.366
VERY WELL.

54:34.433 --> 54:38.066
YOU CAN HAVE AN ACT THAT KILLS

54:38.133 --> 54:41.600
-- IN A GOOD WAY -- BUT IF YOU

54:41.666 --> 54:46.133
INSULT THE AUDIENCE.

54:46.200 --> 54:49.133
IF YOU MAKE THEM HATE YOU, DEAD

54:50.433 --> 54:51.433
THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU THAT

54:51.900 --> 54:53.333
AND IF THEY DON'T LAUGH IT'S NOT

55:02.600 --> 55:05.300
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

55:05.366 --> 55:07.400
CAN WE START WITH THAT?

55:07.466 --> 55:08.600
IS THAT REALLY SO HARD?

55:08.666 --> 55:09.200
I KNOW, IT WOULD BE EASIER IF

55:09.266 --> 55:10.533
EVERYONE BAD WOULD JUST DIE, BUT

55:10.600 --> 55:11.766
THAT'S NOT A PLAN AND THEY'RE

55:11.833 --> 55:13.200
NOT GOING TO.
