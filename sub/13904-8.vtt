00:02.700 --> 00:04.100
Hi, Richard.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Bambi.

00:06.460 --> 00:09.000
- Yes?
- Would you like to see me again?

00:09.001 --> 00:10.419
I'd love to.

00:10.420 --> 00:12.705
This is Dunkie... Duncan.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.740
This is Duncan. He's my boyfriend.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.620
'Clients, like most people,
can get stuck in a routine.

01:03.780 --> 01:06.980
David, old favourite
and plastic surgeon... '

01:07.015 --> 01:09.025
Good with his hands.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.820
# Good morning, good morning, to you. '

01:10.855 --> 01:12.500
Ahhhh...

01:13.540 --> 01:16.260
Don't you ever fancy
something different?

01:17.660 --> 01:20.140
- Why don't you like this?
- No, no, no, it's fine.

01:20.175 --> 01:22.145
It's just... You look a bit bored.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.420
- What?
- It's the same thing every booking.

01:25.455 --> 01:27.785
- Well, I like it.
- Yeah, but...

01:27.820 --> 01:30.200
- Why do you always settle for erm...
- A hand shandy?

01:30.201 --> 01:31.025
Exactly.

01:31.060 --> 01:33.500
When you can try some champagne?

01:35.420 --> 01:38.465
Come on, there must be
something else you'd like.

01:38.500 --> 01:43.460
Some secret desire, some
itch you'd like me to scratch.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.465
What is it? Come on. Tell me.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.985
I don't judge, I'm
impossible to embarrass

01:51.020 --> 01:54.500
and this is the one place you
can be completely honest. Come on.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.380
(Whisper it.)

02:03.180 --> 02:04.300
- Oh!
- Is that OK? (LAUGHS)

02:04.301 --> 02:05.301
Yeah.

02:06.220 --> 02:07.860
You know me, anything goes.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.060
# It's not the way you smile that... #

02:13.095 --> 02:14.860
Have you ever done it before?

02:15.740 --> 02:18.500
Medical school. Christmas Review.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.340
- I sang South Pacific in suspenders.
- Nice (!)

02:23.375 --> 02:25.305
Not for the audience.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.540
I still remember the feel of them.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.865
It was tight, smooth...

02:30.900 --> 02:32.900
Have you ever worn
women's underwear since?

02:32.935 --> 02:35.060
I did ask a girlfriend once.

02:36.260 --> 02:39.180
- Well, I didn't exactly ask.
- It didn't go down well?

02:39.215 --> 02:41.537
She jumped to certain assumptions.

02:41.572 --> 02:43.825
She made out I was some kind of-

02:43.860 --> 02:47.700
Cross-dressing deviant
latent homosexual.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.105
Exactly. And I'm not.

02:50.140 --> 02:52.500
At least not on a week day.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.660
- Don't laugh.
- I won't.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.225
Oh! Wow. How does it feel?

03:02.260 --> 03:04.900
- Unbelievable.
- It should do.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.320
- Pure silk.
- Oh, God...

03:08.355 --> 03:10.427
- Sheer tulle.
- Christ...

03:10.462 --> 03:12.281
- Chantilly lace.
- Oh.

03:12.316 --> 03:14.065
- Satin bows.
- Mmmmm...

03:30.500 --> 03:35.100
Everyone's got something. It's just
a case of finding out what it is.

03:35.135 --> 03:38.100
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
Eventually, the truth will out.

03:48.020 --> 03:51.020
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

03:55.180 --> 03:57.940
Now, I didn't tell you because
I didn't want you to panic,

03:57.975 --> 03:59.580
but this is actually our wedding day.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.600
- Hannah...
- No, no. Don't worry, it's all sorted.

04:02.601 --> 04:03.301
The vicar's a sweetie,

04:03.302 --> 04:06.200
your mum's hat is a triumph and
I've written your vows, top pocket.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.300
'Weddings bring out
the best in people...

04:18.779 --> 04:21.140
...even if you don't
follow all the traditions.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.860
Who said you had to be a
be a virgin to wear white?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.980
You don't have to be a
prince to marry a princess.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.900
And not all fairy
godmothers carry a wand. '

04:35.935 --> 04:36.780
Hello.

04:37.780 --> 04:38.900
Bambi!

04:40.100 --> 04:40.905
You OK?

04:40.940 --> 04:44.260
Yeah, I'm just not sure
where I'm supposed to be.

04:44.295 --> 04:45.200
- Do you want me to find out?
- Yes.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.201
OK.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.745
(What the hell are you doing
here? I can't believe you came!)

04:50.780 --> 04:53.780
- I didn't have much choice.
- Couldn't you have made up some excuse?

04:53.815 --> 04:55.580
I did try. Believe me.

04:56.340 --> 04:58.060
- Hannah.
- Oh, hi.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.800
Did you get my missed
calls? Or is your phone...?

05:00.801 --> 05:01.801
No, no, I got them.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.580
All 27 of them.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.460
I was just checking to
see which room we're in.

05:13.260 --> 05:15.460
It's the Westminster
Room. Just up there.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.660
- Nice list!
- It's just in case I forget anything.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.580
- Mm. Best man. It's an important job.
- Yep.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.305
Well, I best get back to Byron.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.060
Yeah, yeah, me too.
Bambi's nervous as a kitten.

05:30.820 --> 05:33.260
- Are kittens nervous?
- Maybe.

05:33.295 --> 05:35.700
You know... if there's a dog around.

05:40.420 --> 05:42.305
Good afternoon.

05:42.340 --> 05:46.540
Duncan, this is Stephanie.
Stephanie, this is Duncan.

05:46.575 --> 05:47.700
Stephanie is... erm...

05:47.701 --> 05:50.500
Mother of the bride.
Pleased to meet you.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.300
Belle, a word?

05:55.260 --> 05:58.660
How does two weeks in the Maldives
sound? The most fascinating client.

05:58.695 --> 06:02.060
Jesus, Stephanie. This is a wedding
and in case you haven't noticed

06:02.095 --> 06:03.900
I have a boyfriend. I
can't just disappear off.

06:03.901 --> 06:05.500
Oh, what a shame.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.980
- Did I mention he has his own island?
- I'm really sorry, I can't.

06:09.015 --> 06:12.620
But thanks for thinking of
me. It's very kind of you.

06:12.655 --> 06:15.140
Well, you know me: 60%
heart. 40% commission.

06:20.340 --> 06:22.180
- Rings?
- In here.

06:23.340 --> 06:24.980
You all right?

06:27.460 --> 06:29.580
Who needs family when
you've got friends, right?

06:31.620 --> 06:35.580
Oh, actually I wanted
to erm... give you this.

06:35.615 --> 06:38.105
Gear! Byron, really not the time.

06:38.140 --> 06:41.100
No, I want you to look
after it, until after.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.225
Right. Of course.

06:43.260 --> 06:46.100
I don't want it to be blurred, you know?

06:46.135 --> 06:48.420
I wanna remember everything today.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.660
Sharp around the edges.

06:58.380 --> 07:02.860
Listen, I know you haven't
always been 100% about Byron...

07:02.895 --> 07:05.620
but I want us all to be friends...

07:05.655 --> 07:08.340
You, me, Byron... Ben.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.860
All that matters is you and Byron.

07:11.895 --> 07:13.660
And that you're sure about this.

07:13.695 --> 07:15.377
I am.

07:15.412 --> 07:17.025
Good.

07:17.060 --> 07:20.340
I'm not even gonna try and explain
why, cos I'll just talk too much

07:20.375 --> 07:22.385
- and annoy you like I usually do.
- Oh, Bambi...

07:22.420 --> 07:25.940
I know I try too hard. I'm
always saying the wrong thing

07:25.975 --> 07:27.865
and then I see that
look in people's eyes

07:27.900 --> 07:29.940
- like I'm some kind of annoying fly.
- Oh, don't...

07:30.980 --> 07:34.300
But with Byron, I never
have to stop myself,

07:34.335 --> 07:37.620
or try and be something
I'm not. I'm just me.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.380
And that's why I'm sure.

07:43.740 --> 07:45.825
Do you know what?

07:45.860 --> 07:47.580
- You're an inspiration.
- What?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.620
You just do it, you make the leap.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.980
Maybe that's what I
should do with Duncan.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.780
- Belle...
- Why not?

07:59.820 --> 08:01.665
I can't keep doing this.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.540
I can't keep running
away from how I feel.

08:04.740 --> 08:06.380
I love him.

08:08.420 --> 08:10.060
Oh... fuck.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.140
What?

08:15.140 --> 08:17.545
I know him.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.860
He is a punter. Duncan is a client.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.300
What?

08:25.100 --> 08:27.705
I had him the other day.

08:27.740 --> 08:32.980
He called himself Richard. He booked
me. He said he would book me again.

08:36.179 --> 08:37.780
I am so sorry.

08:41.059 --> 08:42.945
But you should know, shouldn't you?

08:42.980 --> 08:45.780
You should know the truth about him
before you go falling in love with him.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.340
Oh, Belle.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.140
Registrar's ready. We're on.

09:07.020 --> 09:10.100
The wedding ring is an unbroken circle.

09:10.135 --> 09:12.897
It has no beginning and no end.

09:12.932 --> 09:15.660
It symbolises your un-ending...

09:17.780 --> 09:19.945
We have now come to
the exchange of rings,

09:19.980 --> 09:24.305
which is the traditional way
of sealing the contract...

09:24.340 --> 09:28.900
I, Byron Seebohm, give you this
ring, as a symbol of my love.

09:34.300 --> 09:39.220
I, Gloria White, give you this
ring, as a symbol of my love...

09:44.060 --> 09:46.345
'You are everything.

09:46.380 --> 09:50.860
My best friend. My Bam-Bam. Forever. '

09:52.500 --> 09:55.740
'The day we met was the
first time I felt... '

09:58.260 --> 10:00.585
I don't need this.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.700
You know how I feel. And you know why?

10:03.580 --> 10:05.740
Cos you are the only one who ever asks.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.585
I love you.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.740
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:50.375 --> 10:52.220
All good? I have to
get back to the office.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.085
- Hannah?
- No!

10:55.120 --> 10:57.880
If you want me, you can pay for
me, like you paid for the others.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.360
Is it true? Just tell me.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.560
- Is what true?
- Have you slept with Bambi?

11:13.240 --> 11:15.880
- Hannah, please-
- So you did? You slept with her?

11:15.915 --> 11:17.520
You paid for Bambi!

11:19.240 --> 11:21.965
- How many times?
- Hannah...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Was it just a one off?
Or have you seen her before?

11:27.040 --> 11:29.720
I have never been with her before.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.600
But you've been with other escorts?

11:37.680 --> 11:38.600
Yep.

11:41.520 --> 11:45.285
Was it because of me? The
book? Did I push you towards it?

11:45.320 --> 11:50.000
It wasn't the book. Look, we never
said what we had was exclusive.

11:50.035 --> 11:52.440
You sleep with other men,
I sleep with other women...

11:52.475 --> 11:54.517
It's my job! It's what I do!

11:54.552 --> 11:56.560
- It's different.
- Is it?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.845
How many times? How many times

11:59.880 --> 12:02.160
have you been unfaithful
since we've been together?

12:04.240 --> 12:07.125
- Ten? More than ten?
- Hannah...

12:07.160 --> 12:09.720
More than 20? Who with?
Just escorts or other girls?

12:09.755 --> 12:11.697
Other writers? Do you
fuck all your authors?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.640
We all know how you
like it over the desk.

12:15.280 --> 12:16.920
Right, downstairs.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.440
Hannah, this doesn't
have to get unpleasant.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.640
So, why didn't you tell me if
you thought it was all so fine?

12:26.675 --> 12:29.605
(SIGHS) Cos I knew it would hurt you.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.685
You knew it would hurt
me. You must have known

12:31.720 --> 12:34.360
you were doing something wrong?
You don't even make sense!

12:37.120 --> 12:41.640
If you look back over our
relationship, I never lied to you...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.165
How can you say that?

12:44.200 --> 12:48.245
OK, well you tell me. When
did I ever misrepresent myself?

12:48.280 --> 12:50.960
I told you I was a fuck up. I
told you I was no good at this...

12:50.995 --> 12:53.485
That's your answer, your
'Get Out Of Jail Free' card?

12:53.520 --> 12:56.760
'I told you I was a fuck up,
therefore I can behave how I want?

12:56.795 --> 12:58.457
Fuck who I want? Lie when I want?'

12:58.492 --> 13:00.120
- Hannah-
- No, don't touch me!

13:02.520 --> 13:05.800
What did you want, Hannah? What
did you want me to give you?

13:05.835 --> 13:09.437
I wanted honesty! I wanted
a man who didn't lie.

13:09.472 --> 13:13.005
- I didn't. I never lied to you.
- Yes, you did.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.540
And y'know the biggest lie?
You told me you loved me.

13:14.541 --> 13:17.520
I did. I do. I do love you.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.925
When I said it, I meant it.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.240
And when you were fucking
Bambi, did you mean it then?

13:26.880 --> 13:29.440
Wh... What was I to you?

13:30.040 --> 13:33.045
A story? A cash cow?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.085
Look into my eyes, tell me you love me,

13:35.120 --> 13:37.880
- squeeze me till the words come out!
- No, Hannah...

13:41.000 --> 13:43.205
I'm a whore...

13:43.240 --> 13:46.525
who has sex for money, who
gets judged and looked down on.

13:46.560 --> 13:51.040
But you know what? When I look at
you, I can hold my head up high.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.880
I wanted to punch him. You
know like a proper punch.

14:05.915 --> 14:08.400
On the nose. Crunch. Blood everywhere.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.720
You'd have probably missed.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.440
Or swung like a girl, arms flailing.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.085
My job is to read men...

14:24.120 --> 14:27.600
...know what they want... what they are.

14:27.635 --> 14:29.445
I missed it.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.120
I really didn't see that coming.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.800
I should've listened to you.

14:40.835 --> 14:42.405
Hannah.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.760
Yeah, but you knew.

14:45.560 --> 14:49.160
Not that. I didn't know that.

14:53.440 --> 14:57.140
I didn't know anything, except I
hated his stupid fucking llama face

14:57.141 --> 14:58.440
and the way he spoke to me.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.000
I'm sorry.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.400
You know what I hated the most?

15:11.520 --> 15:13.360
The way I felt when I saw you together.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.160
MAN: Congratulations.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.180
Gloria's husband. Started
his honeymoon a bit early.

15:32.215 --> 15:35.920
Ben, would you stop calling
me that. I'm sorry, Gloria.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.840
- He did really well today.
- Really well.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.080
You all right, Han?

15:49.160 --> 15:51.885
You know what I think
would make you feel better?

15:51.920 --> 15:55.280
We should break into his
office, steal back your book.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.140
It's not written on some giant
scroll, Bambi. I email it.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.920
- Well, then we'll take his computer.
- That's a good idea.

16:01.955 --> 16:03.520
Is it?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.920
- She's got a point.
- About what?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.400
You still want to do this book?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.400
It wasn't ever really
about the writing, was it?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.360
Not this time. I just did it

16:19.395 --> 16:21.297
cos he wanted me to,

16:21.332 --> 16:23.200
and then I got involved.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.620
So write about him.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.720
Your last chapter.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.280
Duncan and his little habit.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.920
Do you want Duncan to be the man
who profits from your life story?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.645
Right.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.000
- You all done?
- Yeah.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.620
Feel better?

17:46.655 --> 17:48.760
Maybe. A bit.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.400
So now...

17:56.160 --> 17:58.120
We send all.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.040
He's never gonna publish it now.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.400
You sure?

18:10.435 --> 18:12.280
Sure.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.880
'What do men want from escorts?

18:20.800 --> 18:24.720
Let's start with one man.
Duncan Atwood, my editor,

18:26.520 --> 18:28.760
a serial user of prostitutes.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.520
A man who tells stories for a
living but doesn't know when to stop.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.080
Some men use escorts because they
don't have time for a relationship,

18:43.720 --> 18:45.885
or they want something special,

18:45.920 --> 18:48.840
something their wives or
girlfriends can't offer them.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.800
And some men, like Duncan, use
prostitutes because they can.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.520
Because it's easier, a simple exchange,

19:00.555 --> 19:02.400
without truth or consequence.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.040
And for Duncan, a man so
fundamentally dishonest,

19:08.075 --> 19:09.885
he doesn't even know when he is lying,

19:09.920 --> 19:12.600
it's the closest to a real
relationship he will ever get. '

19:18.880 --> 19:22.400
Come on, Gloria and her husband
are taking us out for breakfast.

19:22.435 --> 19:24.525
Belle, make him stop calling me that!

19:24.560 --> 19:27.760
I have no control over
Ben, never have, never will.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.520
In my job, secrets are unavoidable.

19:34.080 --> 19:37.080
It's who you tell them to that
really counts and from now on...

19:38.520 --> 19:41.680
...I keep my secrets
with those I love best.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.240
(PHONE RINGS) Hello?

19:49.275 --> 19:51.525
Belle? It's Stephanie.

19:51.560 --> 19:56.240
STEPHANIE: Listen, the offer still
stands. The plane leaves at four.

19:56.275 --> 19:58.680
This time tomorrow
you could be waking up

19:58.715 --> 20:01.085
with the sand beneath your toes

20:01.120 --> 20:03.320
and a man between
your legs. Your choice?

20:04.160 --> 20:07.080
- OK, bye.
- Come on, then.

20:07.115 --> 20:08.960
I'm starving.

20:43.355 --> 20:46.040
I love my job.

20:46.075 --> 20:47.325
Hey.

20:55.115 --> 20:58.600
(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)

21:00.320 --> 21:02.240
Ben? What is it? I'm
about to get on the plane.

21:02.241 --> 21:03.241
Look in your bag.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.920
What? Just look in your bag.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.840
- What's going on?
- Read it.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.920
'Duncan was a prick. '

21:15.080 --> 21:17.520
'All your other boyfriends were pricks. '

21:19.280 --> 21:21.640
'I'm not a prick. '
Ben, what is this?

21:24.040 --> 21:25.340
Turn it over.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.640
YOU + ME?

21:30.340 --> 21:31.040
Oh.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.440
Ben, I- I can't talk, I
forget I got to work.

21:38.441 --> 21:43.540
I know, go, have
adventures, see the world...

21:44.440 --> 21:46.140
Just come back to me.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.840
Wow!

21:55.740 --> 21:57.540
Really?

21:58.440 --> 21:59.440
Ben?

22:05.040 --> 22:06.940
Maybe...
