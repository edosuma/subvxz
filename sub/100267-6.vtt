WEBVTT

00:13.314 --> 00:15.149
You were eavesdropping
on some nutsacks

00:15.182 --> 00:17.585
at the bar the other day...

00:17.619 --> 00:19.120
Okay, I've got mine.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.122
Might surprise you
but I'm going with basketball.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.125
BOTH: Oh, Bonnie McMurray.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.094
Wilt Chamberlain claimed
to have slept with 20,000 women.

00:27.128 --> 00:27.995
Not a bad tally.

00:28.029 --> 00:30.632
Not a bad tally
for one tally‐whacker.

00:30.665 --> 00:32.066
That's a lot of driving
to the hole.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.334
That's a lot of rim work.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.136
Did you know
he also set the record

00:35.169 --> 00:37.204
for 100 points in a game
wearing Chuck Taylors?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.273
Hope he had the courtesy
to take 'em off

00:39.306 --> 00:40.307
for his other record.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.409
Given their height and the size
of their feet,

00:42.443 --> 00:44.245
it's safe to assume
that basketball players

00:44.278 --> 00:45.312
also have the biggest...

00:45.346 --> 00:46.380
BOTH: Dicks?

00:46.413 --> 00:48.282
‐Balls.
‐Hey‐ooo.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.185
So in conclusion, I submit,
the sport with athletes

00:51.218 --> 00:53.420
that wheel the most broadskis
is basketball.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.356
‐Jonesy?
‐Football.

00:55.389 --> 01:00.461
Like, American football
or European football aka soccer.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.429
‐Should call it football.
‐Fuck off.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.365
Biggest teams,
so mathematically,

01:04.398 --> 01:05.533
you gotta figure
the highest gross.

01:05.567 --> 01:06.801
Not saying they pull
the most tens.

01:06.834 --> 01:07.869
Yup.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.270
Gross is the operative word
here.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.805
Probably a lotta
fours and fives.

01:10.838 --> 01:11.873
May the fours be with you.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.240
Cuz some of those linemen are...

01:13.274 --> 01:15.543
‐Offensive?
‐Hey‐ooo.

01:15.577 --> 01:17.378
‐BONNIE: Reilly.
‐Baseball.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.114
Not to be confused
with soccer‐baseball.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.348
Yeah, that was
the dagger, buddy.

01:21.382 --> 01:22.316
Why baseball?

01:22.349 --> 01:24.418
Baseball players have
the longest season,

01:24.451 --> 01:26.253
which means
they're on the road the longest

01:26.287 --> 01:29.490
with gives them ample opportunity
to wheel the most broadskis.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.826
Plus they use the least energy
of any sport.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.395
Which gives them the most energy
to wheel broadskis.

01:35.697 --> 01:36.731
I'm changing my answer.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.265
‐Can I change my answer?
‐No.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.734
That's totally cool. I get it.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.802
You can change your answer.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.337
Shouldn't hockey players
be the low hanging fruit?

01:43.370 --> 01:44.839
I didn't want
to say hockey players,

01:44.872 --> 01:47.575
because they are
the low‐hanging fruit...

01:47.609 --> 01:48.643
Fuckin' mind reader.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.345
Yeah, samezies, bro. I didn't want
Bonnie to be like...

01:51.378 --> 01:53.715
(SCOFFING)
Is this guy even fucking trying?

01:53.748 --> 01:56.483
‐Why hockey players?
‐Hockey players at any level

01:56.518 --> 01:58.352
share hotel rooms on the road.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.187
So, like it's curfew, right?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.389
You wheeling back
before curfew just in time

02:02.423 --> 02:04.726
to catch your defense partner
wheeling a road rocket.

02:04.759 --> 02:06.227
What then?

02:06.260 --> 02:07.361
Become his D‐partner.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.563
‐Stick to stick.
‐Tape to tape.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.697
Can't leave.
It's curfew.

02:09.731 --> 02:12.600
‐It's rude to stare.
‐True. You couldn't like

02:12.634 --> 02:13.901
not acknowledge it.

02:13.935 --> 02:15.469
If you can't beat 'em,
join 'em.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.471
If you can't beat it... Join in.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.840
I'd rather jerk off.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.775
So an opportunity
for a hockey player to wheel

02:20.808 --> 02:22.376
very often turns
into an opportunity

02:22.409 --> 02:23.745
for his teammate
to wheel.

02:23.778 --> 02:25.246
With this in mind,

02:25.279 --> 02:27.749
hockey players wheel
the most broadskis.

02:27.782 --> 02:29.551
Did you know
that 100,000 condoms

02:29.584 --> 02:30.618
were handed out to athletes

02:30.652 --> 02:32.419
at the 2010 Olympics
in Vancouver?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.560
‐I did.
‐No, you didn't.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.873
‐Yeah, I did.
‐No, you didn't.

02:34.873 --> 02:36.390
‐Yes, I did.
‐No, you didn't.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.526
450,000 at the summer Olympics
in Rio.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.594
The fuck outta here.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.896
Yeah, hockey players
definitely hold the record

02:41.929 --> 02:43.965
in London bridging broadskis.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.299
Just gotta respect
the Load Code.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.367
What's the Load Code?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.935
Oh, bother.

02:47.969 --> 02:49.671
The Load Code of the road.

02:49.704 --> 02:51.305
Don't get any of your brogurt
on your buddy.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.508
‐Mind your boner batter.
‐Don't spray any Spunky Brewster.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.342
‐There's fines for that.
‐Fines?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.211
Same way there's fines
for stepping on the logo

02:57.244 --> 02:58.445
on the carpet
in your dressing room.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.447
Yeah, or letting your jersey
touch the floor.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.249
Those are
pretty common things though.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.318
You're saying accidentally

03:04.351 --> 03:06.287
brogurting on your buddy
is common enough

03:06.320 --> 03:07.755
for there to be a fines
in place for it?

03:07.789 --> 03:08.823
Load Code.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.857
Load Code of the road.

03:12.594 --> 03:13.861
That's kinda hot.

03:16.798 --> 03:19.801
Oh, Bonnie McMurray.

‐Noah.

03:53.768 --> 03:54.836
Mr. Dyck.

‐Daryl.
‐Hello, Noah.

03:56.771 --> 03:57.672
Daniel.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.341
Haven't seen ye
in the age of a dog once.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.476
My sympathies that the love tree

04:02.510 --> 04:05.446
ye and Lovina tried to plant
together didn't take root.

04:05.479 --> 04:08.015
She's a special gal.
I knows it now more than ever.

04:08.049 --> 04:09.283
How is she doings?

04:09.316 --> 04:10.718
I suppose you heard by now,

04:10.752 --> 04:12.486
she was attacked
at a petting zoo.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.021
No, I had not heard that.

04:14.055 --> 04:15.790
A giant big cock about ye.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.958
From behind even.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.761
Which seems she was
on the receiving end

04:19.794 --> 04:21.563
of a good‐sized prick.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.265
Doctor said he'd never seen
a gash quite that size.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.901
The size of a fist.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.436
And indeed that's all she had
to suppress the bleeding.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.438
Can you imagine?

04:31.472 --> 04:33.274
A fist inside your gash.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.711
Tough week then, eh?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.846
Oh unfortunately,
it doesn't end there.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.916
A couple of days prior,
my two young boys caught

04:41.949 --> 04:43.685
the prickliest
of the itchies

04:43.718 --> 04:46.888
after playing with a pile
of pink insulation in the barn.

04:46.921 --> 04:50.792
Would you believe on the same day,
my daughter fell into the manure pile.

04:50.825 --> 04:53.494
I had two in the pink
and one in the stink.

04:55.597 --> 04:56.564
What brings you by, Noah?

04:56.598 --> 04:59.400
Wayne, your community
has always used us right

04:59.433 --> 05:02.604
and hopefully you feel as though
our community has used you right
as well.

05:02.637 --> 05:03.605
Yup.

05:03.638 --> 05:05.406
I need your help
at the Dyck farm once.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.009
Put it this way.
It's work only men can do.

05:08.042 --> 05:12.079
My two young boys
aren't quite up to the task yet.

05:12.113 --> 05:14.649
Well, we got six strong hands.
We can help.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.851
(SIGHING) I am blessed this day.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.887
For the Lord hath giveth on to me
three able men

05:19.921 --> 05:22.089
willing to help me
with a hand job.

05:22.123 --> 05:23.925
(GROANS)

05:23.958 --> 05:25.827
What type of job is this exactly?

05:25.860 --> 05:27.595
Men banging.

05:27.629 --> 05:28.796
Men pounding.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.065
Best I show you once.

05:34.536 --> 05:35.770
I feel like we got
our own work to do.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.840
‐We'll be there, Noah.
‐NOAH: Thanks unto ye, Wayne.

05:38.873 --> 05:40.407
Oh, bring your tools!

05:42.910 --> 05:44.011
By the way,

05:44.045 --> 05:47.515
my children have recently taken
to digging for buried treasures

05:47.549 --> 05:48.783
in the corn fields.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.819
Their imaginations
hath no bounds at this age.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.454
And I've instructed them to halt.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.122
Please, neighbors,
let me know

05:55.156 --> 05:57.692
should you see my children
corn holing in the field.

06:11.005 --> 06:12.774
Who is that snack?

06:12.807 --> 06:14.008
GAIL: That's Katy's.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.943
‐All yours.
‐Atta babe.

06:17.512 --> 06:18.513
Coach.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.715
What's that?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.483
Yeah, my therapist said I should

06:22.517 --> 06:23.851
get out of the house more,
you know,

06:23.885 --> 06:25.520
be around other people

06:25.553 --> 06:28.756
instead of just staying
in my home, by myself

06:28.790 --> 06:30.525
thinking about
my dead wife Barb.

06:32.727 --> 06:35.062
My therapist thinks I'm obsessive.

06:39.801 --> 06:42.436
Sure wish this stool had
some lumbarb support.

06:46.007 --> 06:48.142
‐Sup.
‐Sup.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.211
‐I asked you first.
‐I recall.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.646
I don't know who you are.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.080
I happen to have
that information.

06:53.114 --> 06:55.149
‐Got a smoke?
‐I do.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.151
Hmmm, smoking's gross.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.987
This chit-chat is really
kind of all over the place.

07:00.522 --> 07:02.056

07:02.089 --> 07:03.558
Katy.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.592
KATY: Gailer.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.562
‐Sup.
‐Sup.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.932
Wanna get hammered?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.837
So, what do you think? We head
over there a half hour, 45 minutes?

07:15.870 --> 07:18.239
You know, we got
our own chorin' to do, so.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.908
Well, you better settle down over there,
or I'm gonna come talk to ya.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.744
You were half rudes to Noah earlier.

07:22.777 --> 07:24.779
‐I wasn't half rude.
‐Were too half rude.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.081
If you were a 2010 Rhianna
smash hit, you'd be Rude Boys.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.249
I wasn't half rude.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.518
If you were one of Santa's
reindeers, you'd be Rudolph.

07:30.552 --> 07:31.686
I wasn't half rude!

07:31.719 --> 07:34.922
If you were an adorable child
from an '80s sitcom,
you'd be Rudy Huxtables.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.758
I was an eighth rude.
Not half.

07:36.791 --> 07:39.226
‐Hey, who wrote techno hit Sandstorm?
‐Darude?

07:39.260 --> 07:41.095
‐He was expose'ta answer that.
‐Oh, sorry.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.497
I'll give you a quarter rude,
but then, I'm maxxed out.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.067
If you were a former New York
city mayor, you would be...

07:46.100 --> 07:47.268
Rudy Giuliani?

07:47.301 --> 07:48.936
No. Bill de Blasio.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.938
Who was notorious for being quite rude.

07:50.972 --> 07:53.074
Fine. I was A&W Rude‐beer.

07:53.107 --> 07:55.176
But I've heard some talk
about Nappers,

07:55.209 --> 07:57.244
and it might have something
to do with what Noah wants

07:57.278 --> 07:58.513
is all I'm saying.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.446
What were you told?

07:59.480 --> 08:01.549
‐You won't like it.
‐Fuck's sake, Dary,

08:01.583 --> 08:03.217
you baited the hook and we bit.
Reel us in.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.186
What was you told?

08:05.219 --> 08:07.154
I heard schmellies
are trying to mix up

08:07.188 --> 08:08.656
‐the blood lines a wee bit.
‐Why?

08:08.690 --> 08:11.258
Probably on account of generation
after generation of inbreedings.

08:11.292 --> 08:14.028
So, the fathers
go out to other dudes

08:14.061 --> 08:16.698
who are outside the family and get them
to come over to their place and...

08:18.132 --> 08:19.266
fuck their daughters.

08:23.037 --> 08:24.772
How'd you stay out of special ed

08:24.806 --> 08:26.273
running with an old wives' tale
like that?

08:26.307 --> 08:27.675
‐It's not an old wives' tale.
‐WAYNE: Yes, it is.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.276
That is straight up life skills.

08:29.310 --> 08:30.778
‐Yes, it is.
‐It happened to Dickskin.

08:30.812 --> 08:31.848
‐No, it never.
‐Yes, it did.

08:31.848 --> 08:32.880
‐No, it never.
‐Yes, it did.

08:32.914 --> 08:34.949
Okay, Dary. Dary, okay.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.283
I'm gonna call Jim Dickins right now.

08:36.317 --> 08:38.219
If I find out
you're spinning a fucking yarn,

08:38.252 --> 08:40.054
you'll find me
in a real bad mood.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.088
(LINE RINGING)

08:42.624 --> 08:43.891
Jimmy Dickins. How're ya now?

08:43.925 --> 08:44.959
Good'n you?

08:44.992 --> 08:47.895
Not s'bad. Listen, I got some
kind of weird to asks,

08:47.929 --> 08:50.264
so what I'm gonna do is just come
right out and ask to you now.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.099
Your terms are acceptable.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.770
(SOFTLY) Goodness,
I don't even think I can.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.906
Jim, did some Napper come up to you and
ask you to fucks his daughter?

09:01.042 --> 09:03.745
A Dickins never airs
his dirty laundry.

09:04.679 --> 09:05.747
Sorry, good buddy.

09:05.780 --> 09:06.981
That's okay, good buddy.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.817
But no such thing
happened to me.

09:09.851 --> 09:11.586
‐Sorry, good buddy.
‐That's okay, good buddy.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.820
Though there has been talk

09:12.854 --> 09:15.089
of such things
in auctioneer circles.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.858
What weres you told?

09:16.891 --> 09:18.993
I'm told livestock aren't
the only thing

09:19.026 --> 09:21.896
schmellies go scoutin'
for in farmer's markets.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.932
‐And then?
‐There's an auctioneer

09:24.966 --> 09:27.101
out Brussels way
about my size...

09:27.134 --> 09:28.703
‐Is he really?
‐Said he was told

09:28.736 --> 09:30.371
by an auctioneer
out Hanover way,

09:30.404 --> 09:31.973
also about my size.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.175
‐Fuckin' Dutchmen.
‐That his cousint,

09:34.208 --> 09:36.043
a significantly
shorter auctioneer...

09:36.077 --> 09:37.111
Swissman, likeleh.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.660
Was offered $500 by a schmelly
at a farmer's market

09:40.660 --> 09:42.650
to lay with his daughter.

09:42.684 --> 09:44.085
In the biblical sense.

09:44.118 --> 09:45.820
Five hundred dollars'
nothing to sneer at.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.789
I'm surprised he get $500
from a Napper.

09:47.822 --> 09:50.257
I was kinda thinking
two bills, maybe 250 tops.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.894
I'm told a hole is cut
into a sheet.

09:52.927 --> 09:54.996
The schmelly daughter
on one side,

09:55.029 --> 09:56.698
the stud on the other.

09:56.731 --> 09:59.100
The stud then threads his penis
through the hole

09:59.133 --> 10:01.202
and penetrates
the awaiting schmelly.

10:01.235 --> 10:02.904
Fuckin' how 'bout it.

10:02.937 --> 10:04.405
Why the sheet?

10:04.438 --> 10:08.109
I'm told schmellies remove
all physical and visual contact,

10:08.142 --> 10:11.112
aside from penile‐vagile,
of course,

10:11.145 --> 10:13.915
to keep the sex limited
to pro‐creation purposes,

10:13.948 --> 10:17.318
and deter it from becoming
"a little more English," as they call it.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.686
Makes sense, I suppose.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.387
Hence the expression,

10:20.421 --> 10:22.423
"put a little English on 'er."

10:22.456 --> 10:24.158
Well, that's some fun trivia.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.061
Hey Jim, did your auctioneer buddy's
auctioneer buddy's

10:27.094 --> 10:29.230
‐auctioneer cousint, uh...
‐Did he get in there?

10:29.263 --> 10:30.497
Well, Dary,

10:30.532 --> 10:36.170
you're no auctioneer if you hear
500 dollars and don't see 525.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.841
And once you've seen 525,
well, you damn well better see 530,

10:39.874 --> 10:43.444
and if you've already seen 530,
you know you're gonna see 535.

10:43.477 --> 10:52.219
(RAMBLING AUCTION CHANTS)

10:52.219 --> 10:54.055
‐Thanks, Jim.
‐Sold.

10:58.993 --> 10:59.994
Jeez, Ellen.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.096
Little dab'll do ya.

11:07.735 --> 11:08.903
Well, let's say it's true.

11:15.209 --> 11:17.244
Dickins' auctioneer buddy's
auctioneer buddy's

11:17.278 --> 11:19.246
auctioneer cousint
was approached by a Napper

11:19.280 --> 11:21.382
at a farmer's market
offering him $500 to procreate

11:21.415 --> 11:22.850
with his daughter.

11:22.884 --> 11:24.385
Five hundred dollars' better
than a kick in the pants.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.353
You're lucky you get 500 dollars
from a Napper.

11:26.387 --> 11:29.056
Yeah, see, I was thinking
two bills, 250 tops.
But, Dary...

11:34.295 --> 11:35.296
What

11:36.263 --> 11:37.832
makes you think

11:39.466 --> 11:41.468
‐all Nappers do this?
‐Objections!

11:41.703 --> 11:42.804
Dan.

11:42.837 --> 11:45.172
Dary is just trying to establish
a history and pattern

11:45.206 --> 11:46.908
of the behavior.

11:46.941 --> 11:49.043
He's not trying to suggest
that all Nappers do it.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.213
He's merely suggesting
that maybe this Nappers does.

11:52.246 --> 11:54.315
‐And is.
‐Withdrawn or rephrased.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.052
Dary...

11:59.554 --> 12:00.755
What...

12:02.824 --> 12:04.158
What compels you

12:05.527 --> 12:06.728
to think...

12:08.043 --> 12:10.565
that that is what...

12:10.565 --> 12:12.266
Noah Dicks was talking about today?

12:13.535 --> 12:16.938
Well, he said the job was men banging
and pounding.

12:16.971 --> 12:19.206
Let the record show
Noah Dicks said many things today

12:19.240 --> 12:20.274
that could be misleading.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.510
I'll allows it.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.979
Then he said it was a job
that only men can do

12:25.012 --> 12:26.280
and then, he winked at me.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.049
‐Yeah, but to be fair...
‐To be fair!

12:28.082 --> 12:29.917
‐To be fair.
‐To be fair!

12:29.951 --> 12:33.054
A wink can mean many things.

12:33.087 --> 12:34.922
Yeah, but the Dickins said they do it
through a hole in a sheet!

12:34.956 --> 12:36.023
Inadmissibles!

12:36.457 --> 12:37.559
Hearsay.

12:37.592 --> 12:40.161
Well, he just said he heard it,
so, yeah.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.529
Dan, whose side are you on?

12:41.563 --> 12:42.864
In closing...

12:45.099 --> 12:46.100
Dary,

12:48.069 --> 12:50.104
would you or would you not

12:51.939 --> 12:53.040
agree with the statement,

12:54.542 --> 12:55.877
"fuck, they can run."

12:58.045 --> 13:00.281
‐I guess so.
‐Dary, it's a yes or no question.

13:00.314 --> 13:01.849
‐Yes.
‐Fuck, can they run.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.820
Every single one of 'em can run.

13:10.191 --> 13:11.192
Nothing further.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.164
I'll be briefs.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.345
Now, Daryl,

13:32.580 --> 13:34.916
we all know you're a good guy.

13:34.949 --> 13:36.984
Objection! Where's he
going with this?

13:37.018 --> 13:38.252
I'm just saying he's a good guy.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.121
Hmph.

13:40.121 --> 13:41.255
He's a pretty good guy.

13:45.126 --> 13:46.327
You're a good guy.

13:47.962 --> 13:51.265
In your opinions,
what's the percent chance

13:51.298 --> 13:54.301
that Noah would wants one, somes or all us

13:54.335 --> 13:56.037
to procreate with his daughters?

13:56.037 --> 13:57.138
Oh.

13:57.138 --> 13:58.372
I'll say she's 50‐50.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.474
Now,

14:00.508 --> 14:03.077
what if it was with his sisters?

14:03.110 --> 14:05.046
‐Lovina Dyck?
‐Objection. Irrelevant.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.981
May I approach?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.015
I'll allow it.

14:16.157 --> 14:17.625
I just always kinda thought
that Dary was maybe

14:17.659 --> 14:19.126
more Lovina's type than me

14:19.160 --> 14:20.962
and uh, given the circumstances,

14:20.995 --> 14:23.264
I figured I'll takes
the opportunity to ask him

14:23.297 --> 14:25.166
rather than stews on it
any longer.

14:28.169 --> 14:29.470
We're going to the Dyck farm.

14:36.177 --> 14:37.545
You wanna look at a menu, chief?

14:37.579 --> 14:40.481
No, I'm trying to cut back
on my barbohydrates.

14:40.515 --> 14:42.950
I'm on this new rhubarb diet.

14:42.984 --> 14:44.018
Is there a barbage back there?

14:46.353 --> 14:49.023
‐Pretty kitty.
‐Another round, please and thank you.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.325
Couple Puppers,
couple Gus'n Bru?

14:51.358 --> 14:52.960
Still got it you old goat.

14:53.494 --> 14:55.462
Great tits, eh?

14:55.496 --> 14:56.998
‐Yours?
‐I know they're great.

14:57.031 --> 14:58.265
No confirmation required.

14:58.600 --> 14:59.634
Then...

14:59.667 --> 15:01.202
I'm like fuckin' Gretzky
in here.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.337
‐I know where everybody is.
‐Gotcha.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.272
And you're talking
to a fellow window shopper.

15:05.306 --> 15:07.141
It's not a crime.
I do it all the time.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.010
‐Bit of look, don't touch?
‐Cheap thrills.

15:09.043 --> 15:10.678
‐Never hurt nobody.
‐Bing bang boom.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.516
You are very cool.
Very cool, very nice.

15:14.549 --> 15:15.550
Yeah?

15:16.584 --> 15:17.985
What are you gonna do about it?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.197
Gentlemen, thank you
for joining us

15:30.231 --> 15:32.066
for an afternoon hand job.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.635
Lovinas.

15:35.136 --> 15:37.371
‐Do we smoke out here?
‐Anita, how're ya now?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.440
It's been quite a week,
as I'm sure you've heard.

15:39.473 --> 15:41.308
May I show you
my sister‐in‐law's gash?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.043
Oh.

15:42.043 --> 15:43.377
We heard.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.246
I'd givens you a calls, but uh,

15:46.213 --> 15:49.050
well, yous don't have phones, so.

15:49.083 --> 15:50.985
ANITA: It's not our only ailment
this week, unfortunately.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.387
Just yesterday I cut my finger
chopping wood.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.723
I continued to work of course,
while occasionally licking it occasionally

15:55.757 --> 15:58.993
to keep the blood from getting on my dress
but, the long and short,

15:59.026 --> 16:01.462
I spent the whole afternoon
licking my own axe wound.

16:02.730 --> 16:04.398
Did the children not offer aid?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.634
Oh, I had sent them into the house
to get out of the sun

16:06.668 --> 16:09.203
and I'm glad for it.
Children do worry.

16:09.236 --> 16:12.473
You're right. The last thing I want
is for the children to look out
in the yard

16:12.507 --> 16:14.308
and see their mother
licking her own axe wound.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.710
Hmph.

16:15.710 --> 16:17.645
Lovina's made lemonade.

16:17.679 --> 16:19.413
And I implore you to hydrate once.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.549
After all, you'll be
hammering box all afternoon.

16:23.551 --> 16:24.752
Hammering box?

16:24.786 --> 16:28.055
My feed boxes were destroyed
in the windstorm Wednesday last.

16:28.089 --> 16:29.624
With another one on the way,

16:29.657 --> 16:32.226
time is of the essence
and we must rebuild at once.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.661
My boxes?

16:33.695 --> 16:35.096
One of those boxes

16:35.129 --> 16:37.164
was constructed by me,
Noah Dyck.

16:37.198 --> 16:38.700
Forgive me mine wife.

16:38.733 --> 16:40.067
And I want to know

16:40.101 --> 16:42.336
which one of you
is going to pound my box?

16:43.771 --> 16:44.772
Thank you.

16:48.743 --> 16:50.077
Thank you.

16:50.111 --> 16:52.379
I screwed that box
for hours yesterday.

16:52.413 --> 16:56.083
My Dyck doesn't have the stamina
he once did once,

16:56.117 --> 16:57.719
so we are grateful
for your help once.

16:57.752 --> 16:59.253
Incidentally Anita Dyck,

16:59.286 --> 17:01.155
did the boys finish
with the three loads of hay?

17:01.623 --> 17:02.724
They finished one.

17:02.757 --> 17:04.425
I did the other two.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.492
For shame.

17:05.527 --> 17:08.596
Imagine, my sons left two loads
on their mother.

17:08.630 --> 17:10.197
Oh, it doesn't end there.

17:10.231 --> 17:12.399
Jedidiah took quite a tantrum
this morning

17:12.433 --> 17:14.235
when I tasked him
with garden works.

17:14.268 --> 17:16.203
I told him to gather up
the garden tools

17:16.237 --> 17:17.204
and go into the shed,

17:17.238 --> 17:20.174
where, unfortunately,
the tantrum continued.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.276
He spent a half hour in there
smashing hoes.

17:23.578 --> 17:26.280
Gentlemen, please enjoy
the afternoon's hand job.

17:28.783 --> 17:32.186
You should know, there's a prize
on this day for the man

17:32.219 --> 17:34.455
who uses his tool the best!

17:34.488 --> 17:35.590
What kind of a prize?

17:35.890 --> 17:37.124
Hint.

17:37.158 --> 17:39.093

17:39.126 --> 17:41.095
and close to heaven
in earthly form?

17:43.364 --> 17:44.365
Objection.

17:45.700 --> 17:49.771
Ah, Daryl. Be a lamb
and helps push these closer to us?

17:50.104 --> 17:51.706
Can do.

17:51.739 --> 17:54.776
I always use a small pillow
to protect my knees.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.110
Would you like one?

17:56.911 --> 17:59.146
Uh, no. I think
I'm all right, okay.

17:59.180 --> 18:00.147
Really?

18:00.181 --> 18:01.816
You wouldn't like a little cushion
for the pushin'?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.319
Hey, be careful
with your hammers, yous two.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.288
Nobody came here
for a finger bang.

18:07.321 --> 18:08.322
(DONKEY BRAYING)

18:09.691 --> 18:12.293
Ah, did you hear that?
It's Donald the Donkey.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.395
Biggest ass you've ever seen.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.438
This donkey
is so tall and fabulous,

18:16.438 --> 18:19.834
just this summer, that my boys
finally managed to mount him.

18:19.867 --> 18:22.403
Took him nine years
to go up the ass.

18:23.838 --> 18:26.240
Did you know that donkey
is considered to be a delicacy

18:26.273 --> 18:27.709
in some parts of the world?

18:27.742 --> 18:31.424
I was in Central America
at a church supper,
and was offered it.

18:31.424 --> 18:35.883
While I hesitated at first,
would you believe I love eating ass?

18:35.917 --> 18:38.553
I would eat ass all day,
every day if I could.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.558
Hey, Noah, you workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

18:43.591 --> 18:46.360
It has been said that I have
fitter skills for yammering

18:46.393 --> 18:47.394
than hammering.

18:48.429 --> 18:49.731
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

18:49.764 --> 18:51.799
But see as we're yammering...

18:51.833 --> 18:54.769

health issues in your family?
