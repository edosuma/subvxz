WEBVTT

00:25.692 --> 00:26.943
Mmm.

00:29.279 --> 00:33.283
-Good morning.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.703
Oh, God, I've got bad morning breath.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.956
I don't care. I like your morning breath.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.918
-I like yours, too.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.837
-Mnh-mnh.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.672
-No.

00:49.007 --> 00:49.966
I missed you.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.511
-While we were asleep.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.513
I missed you in sleep.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.433
Oh, my God. You're such a little mush.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.227
You're the mush.
You just don't want to admit it.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.195
I gotta wake up.

01:10.278 --> 01:12.072
Waking up sucks!

01:12.989 --> 01:16.326
Hey, so, what's the plan for tonight?

01:16.409 --> 01:20.497
'Cause I was just thinking about going
from work to the bowling alley.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.165
Does that work for you?

01:22.248 --> 01:25.543
Yeah, I figure we could
just meet Syd and Jeff there.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.255
Hey, Mickey. Quick question.
Is one of my balls hanging out?

01:33.635 --> 01:36.805
-No.
-Thank you. I appreciate your honesty.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.516
-I think that's what makes this work.
-Yep.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.644
-You!

01:43.561 --> 01:46.189
I have to get ready!

01:47.899 --> 01:51.611
Are you hungry? Do you want me
to make you some breakfast?

01:51.694 --> 01:54.656
Would you make me
a blanket burrito?

01:54.739 --> 01:58.535
Oh, do you want
a little breakfast blanket burrito?

01:58.618 --> 02:01.287
One order coming right up.

02:07.544 --> 02:12.590
Oh, somebody's hungry for a little
breakfast burrito, sizzle, sizzle.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.883
-Mm-hmm.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.260
Sour cream?

02:15.343 --> 02:16.678
Little egg?

02:19.597 --> 02:20.431
Mmm.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.686
Micks, you're wearing my shirt.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.481
Yes! I saw it in the dryer,
and I thought it looked so cute.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.607
Is that okay?

02:29.691 --> 02:32.235
It's great because I've actually
been looking all over for it,

02:32.318 --> 02:34.529
and now I know exactly where it is.

02:34.612 --> 02:35.864
Yep. There it is.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.323
-Yeah.

02:37.407 --> 02:41.661
Whoa! Did any of you guys hear those cats
fighting outside last night, man?

02:41.744 --> 02:43.121
What? No.

02:43.204 --> 02:47.292
They woke me up. They were so loud.
These cats were hashing it out.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.088
Cats can get pretty noisy.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.215
You're telling me.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.429
That's my fruit.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.389
It's really good. Thanks.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.101
Cats are weird, man.
Did I tell you about my cat Zip?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.897
This one time, I thought
she was fighting this other cat.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.900
I went to tear 'em apart,
but it turns out Zip was having sex.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.527
Yes, you've shared that gem before.

03:14.611 --> 03:18.448
When I pulled my hand away,
it was covered in all this weird goo.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.534
Great. I can start my day
now that I've heard about cat jizz.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.288
-Well...

03:25.371 --> 03:26.664
All right.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.168
-Squeeze play.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.922
Man. Who shoved a pole up her ass today?

03:34.005 --> 03:34.881
-Don't say that.
-That's not fair.

03:34.964 --> 03:35.798
Okay, sorry.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.091
-Have a good day.
-Bye.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.468
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.802
See you, dude.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.179
-I'm kidding!

04:21.386 --> 04:22.637
Where are we?

04:22.720 --> 04:24.305
The basement
of the old department store.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.141
Hey, guys. This way. In here.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.397
Are you sure we're safe here?

04:32.897 --> 04:36.317
I promised I'd keep you safe, right?
So, yeah, we're safe.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.957
You're all witnesses. The...

04:51.040 --> 04:55.336
I'm sorry. I can't.
All this blood all over your face, dude.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.130
Arya, you're doing great.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.215
Annie, we have to get this
while the blood looks fresh.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.174
Sorry.
-Jesus!

05:00.258 --> 05:02.051
Stay in the scene
so we don't have to do it again.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.428
Fuck! What was my line?

05:03.511 --> 05:05.972
"You're all witnesses.
That means we're all in this together."

05:06.055 --> 05:08.099
We're all in this together.

05:08.182 --> 05:09.309
"We're all witnesses!"

05:11.227 --> 05:13.938
We're all witnesses. That--

05:14.022 --> 05:17.233
I'm sorry, I can't!
It's coming out of your nose.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.443
It's funny. It's good.

05:18.526 --> 05:22.155
-Say your fucking line!
Chill out.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.531
Jesus! Cut!

05:23.614 --> 05:26.993
Cut! We are resetting!
All teams in here please.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.870
Arya, you cannot call cut!

05:28.953 --> 05:32.582
Whatever, I just did it!
This is a continuity nightmare!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.667
Let's go, everybody!
Move in here.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.298
Look at my aunt. It's our first day back
at work. She's already stressed.

05:40.381 --> 05:44.135
-She'll catch shingles again.
-She must be stressed with this retool.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.678
Hey!

05:45.762 --> 05:48.765
Don't say the word "retool," okay?
It's a reimagining.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.766
Very important to Susan.

05:49.849 --> 05:53.186
No, it's called
"doing everything not to get canceled."

05:53.269 --> 05:55.188
They're putting the show
in present day,

05:55.271 --> 05:56.898
adding teenagers and monsters.

05:56.981 --> 06:01.736
Are you serious? I love the changes.
Arya, playing her own granddaughter,

06:01.819 --> 06:04.655
fighting monsters in the present day.
That rules.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.992
When they said mummy,
I got, like, super excited.

06:08.076 --> 06:12.914
Can I borrow your pom-poms when you're
done waving 'em around like a cheerleader?

06:12.997 --> 06:16.000
Susan Cheryl's not around
to hear you kiss her ass.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.543
Oh, my God. Whatever.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.631
I guess I could be negative
like you guys, but I don't know,

06:21.714 --> 06:24.842
my thing is if you put posi-hivity out
into the world,

06:24.926 --> 06:26.135
then you get positivity back.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.304
-"Posi-hivity"!

06:28.387 --> 06:31.432
I misspoke. You know what I meant.
I said "positivity."

06:31.516 --> 06:33.351
You distinctly said "posi-hivity."

06:33.434 --> 06:35.728
-I heard it.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.146
You knew what I meant.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.525
If you imagine you want
a good parking spot, you'll get one.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.944
You don't have to explain positivity
to me, dude.

06:43.027 --> 06:46.781
I spent $100 on mindfulness apps.
I know what I'm doing.

06:46.864 --> 06:48.866
Fuck the haters, man.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.993
No, it's fine.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.832
This is my last teaching job.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.667
Look around.
See the show we're making?

06:57.750 --> 07:00.378
-This is everybody's last job.
-I'm serious.

07:00.461 --> 07:04.257
Six more months of kids neglecting me
while I teach the US Constitution,

07:04.340 --> 07:06.175
-and I'm out.
-Sound like a solid plan.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.719
-Oh! I'll be right back.
-Cool.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.223
-Evan.
-I don't have time right now.

07:12.306 --> 07:16.018
I know. I wanted to get you something.
A little welcome-back present.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.897
-Wow!
-They're noise-canceling headphones.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.192
Next time you're sick of hearing me,
you can pop those on.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.113
Thanks. This gift is really intense.

07:27.196 --> 07:32.368
Oh. Well, you're welcome. I just...
I wanted to start off on the right foot.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.662
-Cool.
-Cool.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.038
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.124
-All right.
-All right.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.924
Okay, we're gonna have a good six months.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.634
Okay.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.931
Fuck me.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.518
Would you wanna do as a topic,

07:57.602 --> 08:00.438
when that girl talked about
getting horny while on her period?

08:00.521 --> 08:04.317
-I loved that. It's true. I do.
-Me, too. Nobody talks about it.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.028
Sounds like some real feminism
at work here, huh?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.364
Whoo! Getting that
millennial perspective, right?

08:10.448 --> 08:12.408
Uh... Or when that woman talked about

08:12.492 --> 08:14.327
how her husband can't get hard
on their honeymoon.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.455
-We could turn that into something.
-That could be a whole episode on--

08:17.538 --> 08:21.792
I'm doing a thing on impotence today.
You might wanna steer clear of that.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.379
Well, actually, we talked about it
on our show first, so...

08:25.463 --> 08:28.925
So, what? You don't own impotence.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.135
-No, but I heard that you do.

08:33.262 --> 08:34.222
Fuck.

08:34.305 --> 08:38.184
Relax! There's gonna be some crossover
with our shows. It's fine.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.685
Apparently, there's a lot!

08:39.769 --> 08:44.398
Last week, I did a whole thing
on withholding orgasms.

08:44.482 --> 08:48.778
I tune into your show the next day,
big surprise.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.781
"Today's topic: Withholding orgasms."

08:51.864 --> 08:55.243
Or whatever you called it.
"When Your Bae Won't Cum."

08:55.326 --> 08:58.037
So you think that we're stealing from you?

08:58.120 --> 09:03.251
I'll just say this. If imitation
is the highest form of flattery,

09:03.834 --> 09:06.254
well, then I'm very flattered. Okay?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.384
All righty. You have to keep this
between you and me for now.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.261
Oh, juicy.

09:13.844 --> 09:18.099
Starting next week, Dr. Greg's show
is going from two hours to one.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.477
-Be nice. Okay.
-Sorry.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.021
-It's just cut in half. Wow. Okay.
-Yeah.

09:24.689 --> 09:28.317
And that hour is going to another show.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.656
Your show! Yours! Stella's!

09:34.824 --> 09:39.370
Really?
-It's great. It's the best news ever.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.496
Wow!

09:41.330 --> 09:42.540
Does Greg know yet?

09:42.623 --> 09:46.836
No. I like to give the good news first.
Warms me up for the bad news.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.591
Do I mind telling Greg
I'm taking an hour from him?

09:52.508 --> 09:53.884
No, not at all.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.055
Hey, I'm Jayke. I'm from Texas.
I'm excited to be part of the show.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.268
I love clothes.
I also love music. I write it.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.646
All right. Cool.
That's great. Jayke.

10:06.188 --> 10:10.276
Now you just toss that ball.
Just toss it to somebody.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.570
Marina. I'm from Vancouver.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.907
I don't know.
Brooklyn's teaching me how to drive.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.410
-It's not going amazing.
-Yeah. You suck.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.454
I wouldn't talk. You ran over a cat.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.497
Oh...

10:23.581 --> 10:25.958
Uh-oh.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.754
-I'm Arya.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.215
And as someone who has been
in Gus' classes before,

10:33.299 --> 10:36.093
I can tell you that
we do not do anything here.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.471
We just waste time
until we're needed on set.

10:39.180 --> 10:44.018
And since this is not a real school,
it does not matter if you try or not.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.312
Not funny. Yeah.
-Damn.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.648
Good to know.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.692
Wait. Who has read the script
for the next episode?

10:51.776 --> 10:54.403
Yeah, I read it.
There's, like, flying and stuff, right?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.404
Bunch of wires.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.906
We all get to fly?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.533
Yeah, everyone gets to fly except Arya.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.495
Doesn't matter. I've done wires before.
It's a pain in the ass.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.373
I had to do it
three days in a row on <i>Liberty Down.</i>

11:05.456 --> 11:09.377
Very subtle name-drop
on the big movie you were in.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.586
Hey.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.756
"I'm Arya.
I had to do this movie<i> Liberty Down.</i>

11:13.839 --> 11:15.633
-God, it sucked."
-Okay, guys, all right.

11:15.716 --> 11:19.387
"I had to work with Brad. Bradley Cooper.
But he's really nice.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.931
He's, like, so cool.
We text all the time."

11:22.014 --> 11:26.268
Enough goofing around. I'm a goofball too,
but let's not be disrespectful.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.314
If all of our characters get to fly,
why doesn't Arya's?

11:30.398 --> 11:34.193
Susan said it's because
my character's still too young.

11:34.985 --> 11:38.114
She hasn't developed
all her "witch" powers.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.157
-That makes sense.
-Oh, my God...

11:40.241 --> 11:43.619
Okay. All right.
Let's leave Arya alone for a second

11:43.702 --> 11:46.205
and just jump into some math.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.587
Hey. Uh...

11:54.672 --> 11:58.509
-Truman said you wanted to see me.
-You're gonna wanna shut the door.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.888
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.768
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.023
What's going on?

12:14.442 --> 12:18.904
-They're cutting an hour from your show.
Who said?

12:20.281 --> 12:23.701
The bosses from Subzero in New York.

12:24.285 --> 12:27.371
There's no warning
Who's getting it?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.958
Okay. Here's where it gets awkward.
Me and Stella.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.128
Fuck off now!
Okay!

12:35.296 --> 12:36.839
Oh, my God.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.552
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.265
Oh.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.062
I knew this was gonna happen.
I saw all the signs.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.648
-It all started with the posters.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.694
My poster was the first thing you saw
when you came into the office.

12:58.777 --> 13:03.240
Then it was replaced by Stella's poster,
and now, it's next to the bathroom.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.659
Ten feet away from a fucking toilet!

13:05.743 --> 13:07.620
I think you're being paranoid.

13:08.204 --> 13:12.708
Congratulations, Mickey.
You have taken an hour away from me.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.294
-I didn't take your hour away.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.588
No, your ratings
have been dropping for months.

13:17.671 --> 13:21.425
-I'm sorry! It's not my fault.
-See you later.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.094
You never listen to me!
I tried to tell you.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.597
You gotta switch it up.
No more canned calls.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.517
Then you'd go, "No, you get
on the phone and--"

13:29.600 --> 13:31.268
You win! You win!

13:31.352 --> 13:34.855
Have fun winning the rest
of your very short life

13:34.939 --> 13:38.692
after you relapse!

13:43.989 --> 13:45.866
That was amazing.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.952
On behalf of the office,
I wanna thank you.

13:48.536 --> 13:52.414
-I think he lost the rest of his hair.
-He did not take that well.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.293
Your energy's weird. I'm gonna go.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.003
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:00.923 --> 14:06.136
Uh-huh. Yeah. I agree. I agree 100%.

14:07.304 --> 14:10.599
I don't like that idea,
but I agree with the first thing you said.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.351
I mean, we can try it.

14:19.900 --> 14:24.071
Yeah. Okay. All right. Will do.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.322
Bye.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.786
What were we talking about?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.163
Oh! Right, right. Um...

14:33.247 --> 14:36.792
I need you to start coming in earlier
to teach. Like, six a.m.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.462
We have so many kids and have
to start front-loading our days.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.549
Yeah. No, I wanna make you happy.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.510
So, whatever I can do
to be of value to you...

14:46.594 --> 14:50.264
Your value is that you're a pushover
who doesn't get in my way.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.099
Don't fuck up your best quality.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.560
Okay.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.395
Can I borrow her for a second?

14:58.647 --> 14:59.857
All right.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.282
-Do you want this open--
-Closed.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.746
-Jesus.
-Jesus Christ.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.080
What the fuck?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.708
-He got me a gift. Headphones.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.585
Like it's our anniversary.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.629
God, he triggers me.
Yeah.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.047
Something about his face.

15:23.130 --> 15:27.384
For me, it's his voice.
He's just such a cloying, needy little...

15:32.973 --> 15:34.183
Hey.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.728
Tough first day, huh?

15:37.811 --> 15:40.689
You've had a bad day?
I'm stuck in this shithole.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.734
God, they won't let me do a voice
on <i>Trolls 2.</i>

15:44.652 --> 15:47.488
You know, Arya, just some friendly advice.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.574
You should be more grateful
for everything you got.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.202
I'm the asshole
for not appreciating my money?

15:53.285 --> 15:57.790
Jesus, have you seen the other kids?
I'm a parent's dream compared to them.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
In a month, they're all gonna be living
at Charlie Sheen's house.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.171
-Pretty sweet setup. I'd take it.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.547
Whoa!

16:05.631 --> 16:08.509
Hey, honey. Sorry, I'm late.
They kept me at the gate.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.679
Oh... Cool new car.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.389
The studio gave it to her.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.558
They want her
to do the <i>Liberty Down </i>sequel.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.937
The movie hasn't come out yet,
and it's testing off the charts.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.981
But you're not old enough to drive.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.066
It's not like they'd give me a bike.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.028
Okay. Well, you have fun
in this dope new ride.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.864
Can't wait to see you behind the wheel
when you turn 16.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.574
I won't drive a two-year-old car.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.702
We'll donate it to Planned Parenthood.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.453
Buckle up, babe.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.497
Let's go.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.000
-Bye, Gus.
-Bye.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.994
Can't believe how fast I got here.
I thought it'd be forever,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.413
but today everything was a green light.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.248
It was like bing, bing, bing.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.880
Honey, Jeff,
I'm not trying to embarrass you...

18:10.923 --> 18:11.965
But you're gonna.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.717
Why the shorts?

18:15.135 --> 18:16.637
We're playing sports.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.433
Let's just... Anytime we leave the house,
big boy pants. Just as a rule. Okay?

18:33.487 --> 18:38.158
Do you remember when people used to wear
bowling shoes out

18:38.242 --> 18:41.495
Totally. I was always too scared
to steal bowling shoes.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.622
-My thing was I used to steal meat.

18:43.705 --> 18:47.793
When I first met him,
I had a sausage stuffed in my leggings.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.086
-Hey!
-Hey!

18:49.169 --> 18:51.088
-Hi!
-Hi, Gus-Gus.

18:51.171 --> 18:54.049
-Hello. Hello. Hi.
-Hey, buddy.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.676
-Hello.
-Hey!

18:55.759 --> 18:58.428
Get that outta there. Come here.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.389
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.890
Sorry I'm late.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.894
There was work and traffic...
I hope you weren't waiting for me.

19:05.978 --> 19:06.812
It's cool.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.397
-We weren't waiting.
Good.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.566
Let's bowl!
-Let's do it.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.151
-Get your shoes.
-My shoes!

19:12.234 --> 19:14.570
All right. You go, girl.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.827

20:01.867 --> 20:06.163
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Yeah! Whoo!

20:06.747 --> 20:10.292
Syd! Thanks for asking us to hang.
This is so much fun.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.254
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?
Thank you. You make us feel cool.

20:14.338 --> 20:17.799
It's mutually beneficial.
You make us feel like a grown-up couple.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.470
Oh, I know. Us on a couples' night
with a married couple?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.096
I think we're doing good.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.681
How long has it been now?

20:24.765 --> 20:27.517
What has it been? Like, five, six months.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.270
I don't know.
I've been sober for three, so...

20:30.354 --> 20:32.856
We've known each other five or six months.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.109
We've been boyfriend-girlfriend
for a couple months.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.861
So you're in the best part.

20:38.695 --> 20:43.659
Everybody knows that the best part
of any relationship is six months in,

20:43.742 --> 20:48.205
because then you're not freaked out
because you know you like each other.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.958
everything's still new,
and the sex is really hot.

20:51.041 --> 20:55.045
I would say that we're in the part
right before the best part.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.215
-Which is maybe the best part.
-Mmm.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.342
I wanna punch you guys so hard
in the face.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.512
-Eight pins, guys.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.471
Eight pins.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.014
-My turn.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.391
Hey, I need to go.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.019
Oh! Mickey, I forgot to tell you.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.522
I listened to Stella's show,
and it was awesome!

21:13.605 --> 21:14.815
Thank you, sweetie.

21:14.898 --> 21:18.902
Yeah, did you guys know?
Mickey's killing it at work. Big time.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.445
Good for you!

21:20.529 --> 21:24.032
Thanks. Yeah, it's funny
how things are weirdly working out.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.909
I thought it was cool to fail.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.871
People who tried at work were losers,
but I am now. I don't care.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.125
This is the most success I've had,
and I love my job.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.336
-Congratulations on being a big loser.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.674
All right!

21:40.757 --> 21:42.175
-Okay.
-Hey!

21:44.428 --> 21:45.554
Gus, how's work?

21:46.888 --> 21:51.226
-Great! Work's... Yeah, it's really great.
-Cool.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.147
Oh, my God! I got a strike!

21:55.230 --> 21:57.357
-Fuck, yeah! Whoo!

22:02.362 --> 22:05.741
So, Mickey says that you've been
writing some screenplays?

22:05.824 --> 22:09.244
Yeah, I'm tryin'. It's a little tough
to break in, but I try.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.662
What's one of your faves?

22:10.746 --> 22:14.499
I guess the one I just wrote, yeah.
The idea was...

22:14.583 --> 22:17.336
Well, I really like erotic thrillers,

22:17.419 --> 22:19.588
but one thing
that's a bummer about those

22:19.671 --> 22:24.134
is that they're usually racist
or sexist or just problematic.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.594
So what I'd like to do

22:25.677 --> 22:29.264
is try to bring the erotic thriller
into a new era.

22:29.347 --> 22:30.640
-It's cool, Gus.
-Yeah.

22:37.689 --> 22:41.026
<i>Cruikshank. This is Evan.</i>
<i>I need you to call me back pronto.</i>

22:41.109 --> 22:43.904
<i>As in not two hours from now.</i>
<i>Got it? Thank you.</i>

22:46.448 --> 22:47.449
It's your turn, Gus.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.120
-It's your turn.
-Oh. Yeah. Great.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.789
Get 'em, Gus!

22:56.750 --> 22:58.627
Knock those pins! Yeah!

23:02.380 --> 23:03.298
Whoa!

23:03.381 --> 23:05.550
-Yes! Yes!
Whoa!

23:05.634 --> 23:07.552
Fuck, yes!

23:07.636 --> 23:10.138
All right.
-We should do this again sometime.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.181
-Definitely.
-That was fun.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.265
Okay. All right.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.392
Okay.
See you at the house?

23:14.476 --> 23:16.061
-I'll be right behind you.
-Bye!

23:16.144 --> 23:17.104
I'll call you.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.367
<i>Um, wow.</i>
<i>Thanks for calling me back late, dude.</i>

23:30.450 --> 23:31.535
Yeah, sure.

23:32.160 --> 23:36.498

23:39.334 --> 23:40.961

23:41.044 --> 23:42.504
Nope. Totally cool.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.631
<i>-Thank you.</i>

26:40.890 --> 26:42.434
Fuck.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.357
Hey.

26:49.441 --> 26:54.696
What took so long?
-I just stopped off at the store.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.991
Little traffic, so...

26:58.700 --> 26:59.743
But...

27:01.953 --> 27:03.455
Got you some ice cream.

27:04.539 --> 27:08.376
-Got a little ice cream for my Micks.
-Aw.

27:08.460 --> 27:12.005
-You're the best.
-No, I'm not.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.180
Mmm...

27:20.263 --> 27:21.640
I went to the grocery store,

27:21.723 --> 27:23.808
and they didn't have
the mint chocolate ice cream,

27:23.892 --> 27:26.269
so I went to another grocery store.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.605
And on the way, there was traffic

27:28.688 --> 27:32.233
at one of those sobriety
checkpoint things...

27:32.317 --> 27:33.401
I'm familiar.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.322
Yeah, then there was construction,
and I was trying to get here,

27:37.405 --> 27:41.284
and they rerouted me
because my regular route I couldn't do,
