01:22.972 --> 01:29.213
"While he was still speaking,
Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived.

01:29.980 --> 01:32.950
With him was a large crowd
with swords

01:32.983 --> 01:36.820
and clubs from the chief priests
and the elders of the people.

01:38.022 --> 01:41.692
Now the betrayer
had given them a sign saying,

01:41.724 --> 01:45.696
'The one I kiss is the man,
arrest him.'

01:47.298 --> 01:51.835
At once he came up to Jesus
and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,

01:51.868 --> 01:53.471
and kissed him.'

01:54.537 --> 01:59.977
Jesus said to him, 'Friend,
do what you are here to do.'

02:01.644 --> 02:05.682
Then they came and laid hands
on Jesus and arrested him.

02:05.715 --> 02:09.887
Suddenly, one of those with
Jesus put his hands on his sword,

02:09.919 --> 02:13.957
drew it and struck the slave of the
high priest cutting off his ear.

02:15.025 --> 02:19.830
Then Jesus said to him,
'Put your sword back into its place,

02:19.862 --> 02:23.568
for all who live by the sword
shall die by the sword.

02:24.501 --> 02:27.405
Do you think that
I cannot call on my Father,

02:27.437 --> 02:31.608
and he will at once send me more
than twelve legions of angels?

02:32.575 --> 02:36.013
But how then would
the Scriptures be fulfilled

02:36.045 --> 02:40.450
which say it must happen
in this way?'"

02:51.427 --> 02:56.533
Throughout your life, people
will come to persecute you.

02:58.102 --> 03:01.038
They will tell you
that you're doing evil,

03:01.070 --> 03:03.507
that your actions
are causing harm

03:03.539 --> 03:07.679
and that everything
you believe is falsehood.

03:10.681 --> 03:12.517
All this happened to Jesus.

03:14.050 --> 03:19.756
And when they came to persecute Jesus,
he knew it was his Father's will.

03:21.758 --> 03:26.663
He knew that it was going
to be okay in the end,

03:28.465 --> 03:32.069
and that this trial
was temporary.

03:33.903 --> 03:37.574
And he knew that to fight
against his attackers

03:37.608 --> 03:40.378
would be to go against
God's plan.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.849
If you fight hate with hate,

03:47.850 --> 03:49.787
who really wins in the end?

03:51.854 --> 03:55.792
If you don't love your enemies,

03:55.825 --> 03:58.829
can you really call yourself
a Christian?

04:01.965 --> 04:05.936
If you don't put away your sword

04:05.968 --> 04:08.739
when they come to crucify you,

04:09.772 --> 04:14.144
how can you still stand
among the angels?

05:24.514 --> 05:25.582
Hmm.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.919
Think you can add to it?

05:28.951 --> 05:32.223
It's already 600 words
on a high school baseball team.

05:33.189 --> 05:34.925
The boy hit a grand slam.

05:34.958 --> 05:38.762
And they still lost.
Besides, he gives shit quotes.

05:38.795 --> 05:41.466
Yeah, he's not
particularly loquacious.

05:42.865 --> 05:45.002
You really want me to add to it?

05:45.035 --> 05:48.806
- Na, I'll make it work.
- It already works.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.942
- Hey, Dani.
- Yeah.

05:52.975 --> 05:56.213
That story about the
new home church, can I have it?

05:57.915 --> 05:59.950
I was gonna give that to Collin.

05:59.983 --> 06:02.586
Why the fuck would you give it to Collin?
He can't write for shit.

06:02.619 --> 06:04.989
Well, I thought it
would be a good learning tool.

06:05.021 --> 06:06.956
Baseball is a good
learning tool.

06:06.990 --> 06:09.192
Why, you don't want to write
about baseball anymore?

06:09.225 --> 06:11.728
I want an actual story,

06:11.762 --> 06:16.766
and this feels like the first one
this town has had in a long time.

06:22.038 --> 06:23.940
All right,
if you feel that strongly...

06:23.973 --> 06:26.944
- Perfect, thank you.
- Okay. See ya.

07:25.802 --> 07:28.906
- Aren't you coming in?
- Probably shouldn't.

07:28.939 --> 07:32.176
- Sorry.
- I get it. You're a gentleman.

07:32.209 --> 07:33.310
Hmm.

07:40.117 --> 07:44.155
- Good night, Jessica.
- Good night, Thomas.

08:30.100 --> 08:34.904
Emeth. It's Greek for truth.

08:34.937 --> 08:37.408
- Michael Hallback?
- I am.

08:37.441 --> 08:39.410
And you must be Jessica Cutler.

08:41.211 --> 08:43.147
Please, come in.

08:48.051 --> 08:50.721
Ah, there's the little bugger.

08:50.754 --> 08:55.793
I'm so sorry, uh, new house, can't seem to
find anything, we're not done unpacking yet.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.762
I've seen all this. Riveting.

08:58.794 --> 09:00.330
Whenever you are ready.

09:07.437 --> 09:08.873
I'm ready.

09:10.139 --> 09:12.208
So,

09:12.241 --> 09:16.980
10 to 12 million people regularly
attend home churches in America.

09:17.013 --> 09:18.382
What do you think accounts
for that?

09:20.283 --> 09:22.485
Well, I think that there's a lot
of people that attend church

09:22.519 --> 09:27.258
because they can remain unnoticed,
they blend in with the big crowds.

09:28.390 --> 09:32.495
But that's not how God intends
His relationship with us to be.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.965
You see, going to church
is a very social activity

09:34.998 --> 09:38.836
and your bond with your fellow
believers is incredibly important.

09:38.869 --> 09:43.307
And here at Emeth,
it's our goal to foster

09:43.340 --> 09:47.076
that relationship between
God and His followers,

09:47.110 --> 09:49.846
and to help them grow
in their walk with Christ.

09:49.879 --> 09:51.915
You see there's strength
in numbers.

09:53.350 --> 09:58.822
Speaking of numbers, this very small
town already has a Catholic church,

09:58.855 --> 10:01.024
a Methodist church,
a Baptist church

10:01.057 --> 10:04.293
and even a non-denominational church
that meets at the Petersons house

10:04.326 --> 10:08.798
and gets out just in time for everyone
to make it to the farmers' market.

10:08.831 --> 10:13.770
Everyone here is pretty set in their ways and
anything new doesn't tend to last very long.

10:14.837 --> 10:16.973
What makes Emeth so special?

10:19.241 --> 10:23.980
Father used to tell us a story
about an old western town.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.917
It's hot there,
it's hotter even than here,

10:27.951 --> 10:31.522
and everybody was always looking for
different ways to quench their thirst.

10:31.554 --> 10:34.157
They tried tonics and powders
and what have you not,

10:34.191 --> 10:38.461
but nothing ever left them
completely satisfied.

10:38.495 --> 10:40.397
And then one day
a man came along

10:40.429 --> 10:45.235
and he built them a well.
Water, real thing.

10:46.336 --> 10:50.307
See, Miss Cutler, when... when when you give
people what they've always been wanting,

10:51.575 --> 10:54.078
they'll never need
anything else.

10:56.245 --> 11:00.350
So you've come to our little
western town to bring us Emeth?

11:00.383 --> 11:03.320
- Heh. I mean, if you want to put it that way.
- I don't.

11:03.352 --> 11:06.790
- So your religious organization...
- It's a church.

11:08.424 --> 11:13.996
It's been in the news many times for
its controversial views and practices.

11:14.029 --> 11:15.399
Should we go over
a few of those...

11:15.432 --> 11:17.835
Look, I know
where you're going with that

11:17.868 --> 11:20.871
and those are very extreme cases and
Emeth has dealt with them accordingly.

11:20.903 --> 11:23.206
- Heh. But you haven't...
- Next question.

11:26.876 --> 11:30.246
How does it feel having a woman
asking questions in your church?

11:30.279 --> 11:32.515
Excuse me?

11:32.548 --> 11:34.550
Well, because I know women are supposed
to remain silent during services,

11:34.583 --> 11:37.186
that's in the Bible, right?

11:37.220 --> 11:39.956
Yes, those are God's words.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.292
"God's words."

11:42.325 --> 11:47.064
Is that how you justify the stoning of a
divorced woman in one of your Ohio outlets?

11:47.096 --> 11:49.131
I don't have to justify
anything to you.

11:49.164 --> 11:50.867
Let's see...

11:50.900 --> 11:53.569
Oh, let's not forget Emeth's
notorious reputation

11:53.602 --> 11:56.272
for mercilessly harassing
gay people.

11:56.306 --> 12:01.211
What passage did you pull from exactly when
you decided to burn that gay couple's house?

12:01.244 --> 12:05.548
Those sinners
got what they deserved.

12:05.581 --> 12:10.553
Adulterers and sodomites
have no place in God's house.

12:12.589 --> 12:14.558
God hates
all forms of wickedness,

12:14.591 --> 12:18.596
especially those who think
they're above His chosen leaders.

12:20.663 --> 12:21.966
Okay.

13:07.677 --> 13:13.050
Fine, leave. You'll be back.
You always come back.

13:29.331 --> 13:31.668
Did you only bring one of these?

13:31.701 --> 13:35.038
- What more do you want from me, heh?
- Fuck.

13:35.071 --> 13:37.574
I'm gonna need like four more
if I'm gonna get through this.

13:37.606 --> 13:40.009
Okay, well, you asked for it.

13:40.043 --> 13:42.144
Well,
I didn't think she'd make me go back.

13:42.177 --> 13:44.347
You really thought Dani was just
gonna let you write an article

13:44.380 --> 13:46.482
shitting all over
the new church?

13:47.417 --> 13:48.285
You wanna come with me?

13:50.220 --> 13:53.123
No, I have to go to work and
besides, it won't be that bad.

13:53.155 --> 13:55.591
I mean,
how bad could it be?

13:55.625 --> 13:59.062
And, hey,
maybe Thomas will be there.

13:59.095 --> 14:02.165
- Uh, yeah, I highly doubt that.
- Oh, why not?

14:02.197 --> 14:03.699
Have you not talked to him?

14:03.732 --> 14:05.668
Well, no,
we didn't exchange numbers.

14:05.701 --> 14:08.705
Besides,
he's probably long gone.

14:08.738 --> 14:11.108
Well, whatever.

14:11.140 --> 14:14.211
I can hook you up with one of Sunset
Acres' most eligible bachelors.

14:14.244 --> 14:18.048
I can think of at least two
who've only groped me like once.

14:18.081 --> 14:20.616
Okay, I get it.
My job's not that bad.

14:20.649 --> 14:25.355
Yeah, heh. Well, if you change your mind, you
can always come work for me as a nurse's aide.

14:25.388 --> 14:28.091
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

14:28.124 --> 14:30.226
Changing bedpans
and opening Jell-Os all day

14:30.259 --> 14:32.428
doesn't sound like
fulfilling career alternative.

14:32.461 --> 14:36.600
- You need more of this.
- Yes, give it to me.

14:36.633 --> 14:38.602
Oh, it's all I wanted.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.656
Would you like some water?

14:59.688 --> 15:02.058
What,
is the Kool-Aid not ready yet?

15:03.592 --> 15:05.762
Yeah, sorry. Thank you.

15:17.273 --> 15:20.543
Uh, do you have a bathroom?

15:40.163 --> 15:41.632
Hey.

15:45.434 --> 15:46.502
Thomas.

15:46.535 --> 15:48.604
Sorry, you walked in on that.

15:50.206 --> 15:51.642
So what's up?

15:54.510 --> 15:56.379
So is this why you couldn't
come in the other night?

15:56.412 --> 15:58.415
No, no,
Georgine is not a thing.

15:58.447 --> 16:00.250
No, no, I mean this.

16:00.283 --> 16:02.119
When was I
supposed to bring that up,

16:02.152 --> 16:04.821
before or after you shat
on religion?

16:04.854 --> 16:06.889
Okay, well, you also said you
weren't gonna be in town long.

16:06.923 --> 16:08.424
Yeah, that part's true.

16:08.457 --> 16:10.826
I'm moving to the next town as soon
as we're established here, all right.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.495
My brother's gonna
take over the church here.

16:12.528 --> 16:13.830
I'm just here to help get
the ball rolling.

16:13.863 --> 16:15.799
Right. Okay.

16:15.831 --> 16:18.134
You're not gonna tell anyone,
right?

16:19.568 --> 16:21.403
No, I'm not gonna tell on you.

16:21.437 --> 16:23.539
From what I could see,
it was all consensual,

16:23.572 --> 16:26.175
which is kind of a rarity
for you guys, so...

16:26.208 --> 16:30.713
Yeah, and it's been at the center
of some pretty fucked up shit.

16:30.746 --> 16:33.582
Okay.
So, why are you a part of it?

16:33.615 --> 16:35.718
Pays really well.

16:35.751 --> 16:37.419
Come on,
I know you're not that shallow.

16:37.452 --> 16:39.688
It's the only thing I've...
I've known, all right,

16:39.721 --> 16:42.424
plus it gives me a platform
that I wouldn't have otherwise.

16:42.457 --> 16:47.697
So I try to use that platform to do
as much good in the world as I can.

16:49.532 --> 16:52.402
From everything I know about Emeth,
I don't see how that's possible.

16:53.970 --> 16:56.139
You have to keep an open mind.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.809
You know,
some people fuck in beds.

17:00.842 --> 17:02.544
You know I'd heard that.

17:02.577 --> 17:05.882
Problem is the bathroom is the only room in
the house that doesn't have a camera in it.

17:05.914 --> 17:07.716
- What?
- Yeah.

17:07.750 --> 17:11.253
Father put cameras in all
the rooms except the bathrooms.

17:11.287 --> 17:13.355
He says it's to keep an eye
on his congregation,

17:13.388 --> 17:16.692
but really I think it's just
to keep the leadership in line

17:16.726 --> 17:20.664
from all those non-consensual
acts you mentioned,

17:20.696 --> 17:23.532
which is sad really, you know.

17:23.566 --> 17:25.769
People do whatever
they want when God's watching,

17:25.801 --> 17:28.871
but as soon as they figure out
others are watching,

17:28.904 --> 17:31.208
they change their behavior
entirely.

17:32.541 --> 17:34.810
This is all off the record,
by the way.

17:34.844 --> 17:38.847
Hmm. Shame. Would have made
a fascinating angle.

17:48.324 --> 17:50.826
Welcome.
Welcome to all of you.

17:52.528 --> 17:56.599
I would now like to introduce our
founder and our shepherd of Emeth.

17:56.633 --> 17:58.835
And he can't be here for long

17:58.867 --> 18:01.770
because he has many other places to go
to help spread the ministry of Emeth.

18:01.804 --> 18:05.509
But we have him here today,
which is the greatest blessing of all.

18:06.608 --> 18:07.711
Father...

18:17.920 --> 18:19.489
Welcome.

18:20.722 --> 18:22.358
Welcome all of you.

18:23.692 --> 18:27.698
God has brought
all of you here...

18:30.432 --> 18:35.739
and God wants
all of you to be here.

18:35.771 --> 18:40.843
And I can't wait to see
what he has in store for you,

18:41.943 --> 18:43.413
here at Emeth.

18:46.883 --> 18:48.619
It won't be easy.

18:50.787 --> 18:54.290
God never promised
that life would be easy,

18:55.325 --> 18:58.628
but it is ultimately

18:58.661 --> 19:01.664
the only way to happiness,

19:02.964 --> 19:05.534
to gaining His favor

19:06.903 --> 19:09.506
and eternal life with Him.

19:18.815 --> 19:22.885
None of you
deserve to be here

19:25.587 --> 19:26.690
for you...

19:26.722 --> 19:31.028
We, are all sinners.

19:32.894 --> 19:36.833
But there is hope,

19:38.534 --> 19:41.104
hope eternal

19:41.136 --> 19:45.442
for even the wickedest
of sinners.

19:45.474 --> 19:49.511
Together through fellowship

19:49.545 --> 19:51.315
and accountability,

19:52.481 --> 19:54.550
we can ensure

19:54.584 --> 19:59.355
that we reach paradise together

19:59.388 --> 20:03.326
and inspire others to join us.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.696
Hmm.

20:11.733 --> 20:12.901
We're lucky.

20:14.737 --> 20:20.710
We have a book
that tells us exactly

20:20.742 --> 20:25.014
what we need to do
in order to please Him.

20:26.048 --> 20:28.050
Simple rules,

20:28.084 --> 20:31.955
but rules that the world calls

20:31.988 --> 20:34.691
ludicrous fairytales.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.364
Politically incorrect,

20:42.898 --> 20:45.033
outdated.

20:48.570 --> 20:50.039
I assure you,

20:51.106 --> 20:56.413
there is nothing
outdated about God.

20:57.180 --> 21:01.518
He is alive and well.

21:01.550 --> 21:05.154
And He is in this place.

21:06.689 --> 21:10.727
He is in this town.

21:13.729 --> 21:18.869
Like any father,
He demands obedience.

21:21.037 --> 21:25.909
He demands that marriage
be kept sacred,

21:27.609 --> 21:31.981
that we put nothing else
before Him,

21:33.015 --> 21:38.755
that our bodies
be kept His temple.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.759
Now in this town,

21:46.561 --> 21:48.998
there is divorce,

21:50.199 --> 21:56.006
there are people
who don't put God first.

21:57.573 --> 22:01.811
There is extramarital sex,

22:01.844 --> 22:03.779
homosexuality,

22:03.813 --> 22:07.517
and children born
out of wedlock.

22:09.719 --> 22:13.623
All of these things
are an abomination to God

22:13.655 --> 22:16.658
and those that do these things,
He abhors them

22:16.692 --> 22:21.163
and He has stricken their name
from the book of life.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.472
But...

22:31.907 --> 22:37.779
there is a way
to get our name

22:37.813 --> 22:40.951
back in that book.

22:45.555 --> 22:49.926
And that is what
we're here to do.

23:05.141 --> 23:10.013
<i>♪ Rejoice the lord is king ♪</i>

23:10.046 --> 23:11.914
Fuck you.

23:11.948 --> 23:14.083
You talked about doing good
with that.

23:14.115 --> 23:16.118
What good could possibly
come from that?

23:16.152 --> 23:18.187
- It's disgusting.
- I know.

23:18.220 --> 23:21.557
I know. All right.
But that's not me.

23:21.590 --> 23:23.892
Bullshit.

23:23.925 --> 23:27.262
You're part of it, you're part of the
whole fucking thing, guilty by association.

23:27.296 --> 23:28.632
Look you...

23:30.333 --> 23:34.202
You learn to justify stupid opinions like
that or at least you learn to ignore them.

23:34.236 --> 23:37.640
It's hard to leave something
I've known my entire life.

23:40.241 --> 23:42.645
I don't blame you for hating
the things Father said in there.

23:47.148 --> 23:48.817
Can I see you again?

23:58.894 --> 24:00.329
How about now?

24:21.750 --> 24:25.954
So you're afraid to go back
and face the wrath of Father?

24:25.988 --> 24:29.793
No. Just enjoying being here
with you.

24:32.260 --> 24:36.332
The strange thing is though I'll still
apologize profusely when I get back.

24:38.299 --> 24:41.370
Do you really feel like
you're doing something wrong?

24:41.403 --> 24:43.073
Logically no.

24:44.039 --> 24:46.076
But like guilt just comes
with the territory.

24:48.044 --> 24:51.781
Every little thing I do, it's
this feeling that I can't shake,

24:52.815 --> 24:55.151
which sucks
'cause sex is awesome.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.855
Yeah, how do you reconcile that?

25:02.825 --> 25:03.860
I can't.

25:09.097 --> 25:12.167
But if there is a God,

25:12.201 --> 25:15.371
He's a lot more loving and
open-minded than Emeth preaches.

25:15.403 --> 25:20.041
I mean, there's got to be more than
one way to live your life, right?

25:24.113 --> 25:29.251
I mean,
why should someone perish

25:29.285 --> 25:32.689
just because they lived a life
different from everyone else.

25:34.089 --> 25:37.759
I wish I could be more like you.
More definitive.

25:37.792 --> 25:41.030
That I could just write it all
off without a second thought.

25:42.097 --> 25:46.403
You know, I used to buy into the
whole thing too when I was young.

25:48.436 --> 25:52.040
But when I was in third grade,
this boy in my church,

25:52.074 --> 25:54.009
he was just a few years older
than me,

25:54.943 --> 25:57.946
said that the priest
had touched him, yeah.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.182
And then a bunch of other kids,
boys and girls,

26:00.215 --> 26:03.318
came out and said that he had
done the same thing to them.

26:04.420 --> 26:07.023
You know what the church did?

26:07.056 --> 26:12.194
They moved him to another
church, heh, like an hour away.

26:15.897 --> 26:19.301
One of the boys killed himself
a few years later

26:19.335 --> 26:23.440
and still nothing happened
to that priest.

26:27.143 --> 26:29.778
And this isn't
a unique situation.

26:29.811 --> 26:33.082
That wasn't one bad guy
doing a bad thing.

26:34.182 --> 26:35.785
And the church was complicit.

26:35.817 --> 26:41.223
And so, as part of the church,
I was complicit.

26:41.257 --> 26:44.494
When I told my parents that,
they kicked me out.

26:47.563 --> 26:50.166
I've been making my own way
ever since.

26:51.267 --> 26:53.303
That's why I like
coming out here.

26:54.470 --> 26:55.872
Why is that?

26:55.904 --> 26:58.840
'Cause life is chaos,

26:58.874 --> 27:02.478
but you can choose to
just walk out into that water,

27:02.510 --> 27:06.816
close your eyes
and see what happens.

27:10.686 --> 27:14.556
There's something freeing
about giving it into the chaos

27:14.589 --> 27:17.526
and coming out on top...

27:19.461 --> 27:20.864
if you're lucky.

27:24.333 --> 27:25.902
And if you're not?

27:27.001 --> 27:27.936
Then you're not.

27:31.941 --> 27:32.842
-Yeah.

27:34.276 --> 27:36.144
- It made so much sense though.
- Oh, yeah?

27:36.178 --> 27:37.914
- Yeah.
- Maybe to you.

27:39.882 --> 27:41.284
- I didn't mean it like that, heh.
- Oh, okay.

27:41.317 --> 27:43.152
Okay, maybe a little.

27:43.184 --> 27:45.053
Are you sure
I can't give you a ride home?

27:45.086 --> 27:47.824
No, I'm fine.
I prefer walking.

27:47.856 --> 27:50.192
Gives me time to clear my head
and practice my apology.

27:50.226 --> 27:54.096
- Are you gonna go home?
- I have to, eventually.

27:54.128 --> 27:55.964
Hmm, tsk.

27:55.998 --> 27:59.335
Well, do you want to come
in this time?

28:05.374 --> 28:07.076
No cameras in here.

28:15.584 --> 28:18.554
Can I maybe get
you a drink or something?

29:04.333 --> 29:06.502
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:06.535 --> 29:09.939
- You want some breakfast?
- Sure.

29:13.174 --> 29:15.211
So I'm gonna warn you,

29:15.243 --> 29:18.013
there might not be anything
edible in my fridge, like at all.

29:18.047 --> 29:19.915
- Nothing...
- Morning.

29:22.651 --> 29:27.089
Don't you two make
a nice couple? Mighty nice.

29:27.122 --> 29:28.658
What the fuck
are you doing here?

29:28.691 --> 29:31.192
Get out.

29:31.226 --> 29:35.565
Excuse me.
You never changed your locks.

29:36.965 --> 29:38.667
You never even asked
for my keys,

29:38.701 --> 29:42.939
so you must have wanted me to
come back through those doors.

29:42.971 --> 29:45.574
Get the fuck out!

29:45.606 --> 29:46.942
Shh.

29:49.545 --> 29:52.382
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to your new friend?

29:54.415 --> 29:56.484
I knew you'd move on

29:56.518 --> 30:01.290
but I had hoped you would be with
someone who wasn't so beautiful.

30:05.059 --> 30:06.194
It's time for you to go.

30:07.628 --> 30:08.696
That's funny

30:10.231 --> 30:15.070
'cause, uh, I was thinking
the same thing about you.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.439
Boys.

30:16.471 --> 30:18.139
Seth, do not do this please,
I beg you.

30:18.173 --> 30:19.541
- Hey, hey.
- What the... Hey! Hey!

30:19.575 --> 30:22.111
- Thomas! Thomas!
- You son of a bitch!

30:22.144 --> 30:24.547
Fuck you! Fuck you!

30:27.750 --> 30:29.751
Stop it.

30:36.557 --> 30:38.626
You know,
I never could figure out

30:38.660 --> 30:42.365
what I had to do to make you see
that we were perfect for each other.

30:42.397 --> 30:44.699
Why can't you just see that?

30:49.605 --> 30:52.607
Hey, boss,
what do you want us to do with him?

30:57.112 --> 30:59.215
Take him back where he belongs.

31:09.090 --> 31:10.726
Jessica.

31:13.528 --> 31:14.663
Jessica.

31:30.412 --> 31:35.151
So,
you want to tell us where you've been?

31:37.553 --> 31:39.288
Look, we already know.
Just own up to it.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.256
Hold your tongue.

31:44.425 --> 31:47.329
You spent the night
with another.

31:48.363 --> 31:50.298
You're weak in the eyes of God

31:50.332 --> 31:52.701
and you have soiled your
relationship with your betrothed.

31:52.733 --> 31:55.103
She's not my betrothed.

31:56.238 --> 31:58.041
Never agreed to that.

32:06.815 --> 32:08.683
It's about time somebody around here
started thinking for themselves.

32:08.717 --> 32:11.320
Sit down.

32:12.554 --> 32:16.525
You think you can break God's
rules and just get away with it?

32:16.557 --> 32:18.827
Haven't I taught you
better than that by now?

32:20.761 --> 32:24.332
Yeah, sure.

32:26.201 --> 32:28.671
All right.
Let's talk about God's rules.

32:32.441 --> 32:35.845
That book says we can't
have bacon or shrimp.

32:35.877 --> 32:39.781
You can't trim your beard.
No mixing meat or dairy.

32:39.815 --> 32:43.352
So I guess we're all going to hell for
eating fucking cheeseburgers, right?

32:43.384 --> 32:44.752
No sex.

32:44.787 --> 32:47.390
But you turn a blind eye if it's
the woman you want me to marry.

32:49.290 --> 32:53.162
How exactly do you choose which
of God's rules we follow, Father?

32:55.263 --> 32:58.366
- If only your mother were...
- No.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.634
No, you don't get to do that.

32:59.667 --> 33:02.504
My mother?
I never knew my mother.

33:02.538 --> 33:04.673
You've never had a wife.

33:04.705 --> 33:06.841
Are the three of us
even related?

33:06.875 --> 33:09.678
Oh, right, I forgot, we're not
allowed to ask about that.

33:09.711 --> 33:12.381
We're not allowed to ask any fucking
questions about anything at all.

33:14.316 --> 33:17.819
So, no, you don't get
to guilt-trip me for shit.

33:17.853 --> 33:21.757
You don't have to stand there like I'm a
sinner when you're nothing but a hypocrite.

33:24.326 --> 33:25.528
Repent.

33:29.730 --> 33:30.866
Or what?

33:34.903 --> 33:36.739
That's what I thought.

33:38.272 --> 33:39.641
I'll show myself out.

33:53.488 --> 33:55.191
Here's your water.

33:55.223 --> 33:59.227
I have to go to work but
mom's here if you need anything.

33:59.260 --> 34:02.330
Oh, and your phone was ringing,
I think you missed a call.

34:10.371 --> 34:11.873
Are you okay?

34:37.965 --> 34:39.568
Exactly where I wanna be.

34:40.969 --> 34:42.605
I love you.

34:43.704 --> 34:45.340
And I love you.

35:20.775 --> 35:22.244
Mama!

35:23.378 --> 35:24.547
You awake?

35:27.581 --> 35:29.018
Mama!

35:53.675 --> 35:54.977
It's okay.

35:55.010 --> 35:57.713
- She's gone.
- I know. I know.

35:59.014 --> 36:00.548
Okay.

36:00.581 --> 36:02.518
- She's gone.
- I know.

36:16.664 --> 36:18.833
This isn't the same room
anymore.

36:21.670 --> 36:24.505
I've known this room
my entire life.

36:26.375 --> 36:30.679
I've slept in here,
played games in here.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.350
I even brought some boys in here

36:34.382 --> 36:36.785
because the bed
was so much nicer than mine.

36:39.887 --> 36:42.724
Now everything is gone.

36:46.027 --> 36:47.630
It's just empty.

36:53.969 --> 36:56.371
Whom I gonna take care of now?

36:57.806 --> 37:00.742
Who's gonna take care of me?
I'm not like you.

37:00.775 --> 37:05.580
I'm not self-motivated.
I'm not good at being alone.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.983
You're stronger than you think.

37:08.016 --> 37:10.952
What am I supposed to do now,
just throw myself into my work?

37:10.985 --> 37:12.987
Where's my bright outlook
in that?

37:21.429 --> 37:22.565
You'll figure it out.

37:23.864 --> 37:26.401
I wish you could just tell me
what to do.

37:26.434 --> 37:27.735
The girl with all the answers.

37:29.137 --> 37:32.408
I know.
I wish I could too.

37:39.146 --> 37:41.083
I'm happy it was peaceful.

37:42.516 --> 37:44.986
I'm happy she was asleep
when it happened.

37:51.159 --> 37:53.996
I know it's not gonna
go back to being the same,

37:56.164 --> 37:58.134
but is it ever gonna be
anything?

38:02.170 --> 38:04.072
You'll figure it out.

38:04.105 --> 38:08.177
One day you'll wake up
and it won't hurt as bad,

38:08.210 --> 38:11.679
and it won't be so lonely.

38:11.713 --> 38:13.516
You'll go in that new direction.

38:53.121 --> 38:54.757
Tell me the plan again.

38:59.860 --> 39:02.230
We'll have a little baby girl

39:03.597 --> 39:08.770
and she will be the most beautiful
thing that you or I have ever seen.

39:10.137 --> 39:13.842
I'll go back as assistant editor
of the paper.

39:13.875 --> 39:17.213
You can stay home with our daughter
while writing your stories.

39:19.146 --> 39:22.518
By the time
our little girl turns six,

39:22.550 --> 39:28.023
we will be in a city too big for
small-minded people to hurt us.

39:31.592 --> 39:35.563
She'll grow up
and be who she wants to be,

39:36.264 --> 39:38.934
believe what she wants
to believe,

39:39.934 --> 39:42.505
and love who she wants to love.

39:43.838 --> 39:49.010
No one will ever tell her that she
is less than or not good enough.

39:52.280 --> 39:56.919
She'll have a life far better
than you or I could ever imagine.

39:58.719 --> 40:02.023
And then you and I will grow old
and wrinkly together,

40:04.159 --> 40:08.163
bound together by a closeness
that no poet could put into words

40:08.195 --> 40:10.632
and no scientist
could ever explain.

40:15.670 --> 40:18.139
- I love you.
- I love you.

Hi, Thomas.
Hi, Jessica.

41:10.724 --> 41:12.661
- Hello.
- Hi.

41:12.693 --> 41:15.396
Jessica, you look incredible.

41:15.429 --> 41:18.766
I've never seen a more beautiful
pregnant person before.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.002
Thank you.

41:22.170 --> 41:24.840
I know it's early but,

41:24.873 --> 41:28.744
ah,
we got you a Christmas present.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.778
It's baby blankets.

41:30.811 --> 41:34.415
Uh, Michael actually picked them out.
I just wrapped them.

41:34.449 --> 41:36.952
Thank You, Georgine,
that's very kind of you.

41:36.985 --> 41:39.355
Ah. I hope the child
enjoys them.

41:40.255 --> 41:46.228
And I wanted to let you both know that
Michael and I will be getting married

41:46.260 --> 41:48.029
the weekend
after Christmas.

41:49.731 --> 41:53.335
Anyway, I would love
if you both could make it out.

41:53.367 --> 41:56.237
It will be at Emeth
starting at 4:30.

41:56.271 --> 42:00.307
And I know Michael would be
really happy to see you there too.

42:00.340 --> 42:02.943
Yeah, we'll...
we'll check our calendar.

42:02.976 --> 42:08.215
Great.
Well, happy holidays, heh!

42:08.248 --> 42:10.384
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.

42:20.027 --> 42:23.764
- At some point I'm probably gonna have to pee.
- Mm-hm.

42:23.797 --> 42:25.967
Do you think it's safe to go
in there at this time?

42:27.135 --> 42:31.006
Why, did you want the Emeth VIP
bathroom experience?

42:31.039 --> 42:32.908
Yes. Yes, I do.

42:32.940 --> 42:34.175
We'll find a way to make
that happen.

42:34.208 --> 42:38.413
Is that a promise? Good.

42:38.445 --> 42:39.980
- Hold me to it.
- I will.

42:40.014 --> 42:41.216
- Okay.
- Heh.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.056
Hi there.

42:50.190 --> 42:53.427
- Hi there.
- She's really pregnant.

42:53.460 --> 42:55.796
- Yes, she is.
- I am.

42:55.829 --> 42:58.266
- When's she due?
- Next month.

42:58.298 --> 43:00.134
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

43:00.168 --> 43:02.370
That's because
we're not married.

43:02.402 --> 43:06.741
Oh, poor child.

43:10.311 --> 43:11.814
Enjoy the wedding.

43:17.085 --> 43:21.757
I love you, Michael, and
I know that you love me too.

43:21.789 --> 43:26.260
Because of this,
I desire to be your wife, heh.

43:26.293 --> 43:31.866
For 20 years I have prayed that
God would lead me to His choice

43:31.900 --> 43:38.039
and I am confident His will
is being fulfilled tonight.

43:38.072 --> 43:42.844
Through the pressures of the present
and the uncertainties of the future,

43:42.876 --> 43:45.480
I promise to be faithful to you.

43:45.512 --> 43:50.985
I will love, serve, and obey you
as long as we both are alive.

43:51.018 --> 43:55.089
Christ told us, "The wife should
submit herself to her own husband

43:55.123 --> 43:58.960
as to the Lord for as Christ
is head of the church,

43:58.992 --> 44:01.028
so is the husband
head of his wife."

44:02.297 --> 44:05.900
Michael,
I submit myself to you.

44:14.909 --> 44:19.981
Georgine, I love you,
and I know that God has ordained our love.

44:20.949 --> 44:25.052
Because of that,
I desire to be your husband.

44:25.085 --> 44:29.456
Together we will be vessels
for His service

44:29.489 --> 44:32.126
in accordance with His plan

44:32.159 --> 44:36.864
so that in all areas of our life,
Christ will have preeminence.

44:38.365 --> 44:40.434
Through the pressures
of the present

44:40.467 --> 44:45.105
and the uncertainty of the future,
I promise to be faithful to you.

44:45.139 --> 44:48.943
I promise to love you,
to guide you

44:48.976 --> 44:54.516
and to protect you as Christ did for
His church as long as we're both alive.

44:55.916 --> 45:00.521
According to Ephesians 5 and
the power enabled through him,

45:01.521 --> 45:06.929
I promise to love you as Christ loved
the church so much that He died for her.

45:08.061 --> 45:13.335
And I will treat you as part of me
because in His sight we will be one.

45:24.512 --> 45:29.117
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

45:34.088 --> 45:39.294
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Hallback.

45:58.445 --> 46:00.181
Hello, ladies.

46:01.282 --> 46:05.287
Wow, look at you.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.189
Isn't this just beautiful?

46:08.655 --> 46:11.492
A divine miracle.

46:11.525 --> 46:14.629
Oh, isn't this just beautiful?

46:15.596 --> 46:18.266
That's enough.
Jess, you all right?

46:18.298 --> 46:24.038
- Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.
- Try not to make a scene now, boy.

46:24.072 --> 46:26.974
Not on such
a beautiful occasion.

46:27.007 --> 46:29.009
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

46:29.043 --> 46:31.613
He's a very dedicated
and passionate follower.

46:31.646 --> 46:33.315
Emeth is lucky to have him.

46:34.449 --> 46:35.983
He's an abusive creep.

46:36.016 --> 46:38.619
- He who repents...
- Yeah, save it.

46:38.652 --> 46:40.454
Jess, why don't we go back
to the reception?

46:40.487 --> 46:44.960
Oh, the reception
is for members only,

46:44.992 --> 46:49.096
not for the unwholesome,
not for sinners

46:49.130 --> 46:53.101
who shamelessly lure their
adultery in front of others.

46:55.202 --> 46:59.340
You've made your choice.
There's no reason to come back.

47:09.583 --> 47:11.685
I never wanted a wedding.

47:11.719 --> 47:14.688
When I was growing up, all the girls
would talk about their special day

47:14.722 --> 47:17.592
and I just couldn't picture it
for myself.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.994
I dreaded it.

47:20.027 --> 47:23.163
I had nightmares about standing next
to someone I had no connection with.

47:23.197 --> 47:27.235
- And now?
- Now I'm in love.

47:27.268 --> 47:30.472
I don't need rings
or sexist vows.

47:30.505 --> 47:34.142
I'm here.
I'm never going anywhere.

47:35.742 --> 47:39.413
- I love you.
- I love you too.

47:39.447 --> 47:41.516
- Let's get the hell out of here, heh.
- Yes, ma'am.

48:38.306 --> 48:40.675
All right, Jessica,
get your ass out of here.

48:40.708 --> 48:43.144
You said you were leaving
at 3:00 today, it's 3:30.

48:43.844 --> 48:46.180
Shit, okay.

48:46.213 --> 48:49.717
Um, I'm almost done marking Lisa's
story and then I am out of here.

48:49.750 --> 48:50.818
Good.

48:56.324 --> 48:58.760
Dani, oh, my God,
what happened?

48:58.793 --> 49:02.329
Oh, this? What, you don't like
my new beauty marks?

49:02.362 --> 49:05.232
Dani, what happened?

49:05.266 --> 49:08.369
A few of your church friends
paid me a visit last night.

49:08.402 --> 49:10.405
They threw rocks and bricks
through my window.

49:10.438 --> 49:12.307
Oh. God, why?

49:13.875 --> 49:17.277
Do you remember that story that Collin
wrote highlighting the women's clinic

49:17.311 --> 49:19.114
and the services they provide?

49:19.146 --> 49:20.347
Mm-hm.

49:21.981 --> 49:26.621
I added a little bit in there about how
Emeth is protesting them as baby killers,

49:26.653 --> 49:31.492
which is interesting because abortion
isn't even a service they provide.

49:32.693 --> 49:34.562
They didn't like that.

49:34.594 --> 49:37.331
You should report it
to the police.

49:37.364 --> 49:39.366
I did.

49:39.400 --> 49:44.506
They couldn't prove who it was
but it's pretty obvious to me.

49:45.907 --> 49:48.576
They put signs in our yard
the other day.

49:53.914 --> 49:57.684
Apparently, the snide remarks and looks at
the grocery store aren't enough anymore.

49:57.717 --> 50:00.187
And now they are dragging
Arcadia into it.

50:00.221 --> 50:01.556
Oh.

50:01.588 --> 50:03.657
What am I supposed to do,
just ignore it?

50:04.625 --> 50:07.829
How do you fight back
against something like that?

50:07.862 --> 50:13.233
You'll be okay.
You're almost away from them for good.

50:13.266 --> 50:15.369
But you're not.

50:15.402 --> 50:18.205
Yeah, I'd like to really
see them try and fuck with me.

50:20.574 --> 50:22.943
So you got a good
evening planned?

50:22.976 --> 50:25.646
Yeah, Katie's coming over.

50:25.679 --> 50:28.615
I haven't seen her in forever and we're gonna
start planning Arcadia's birthday party.

50:28.648 --> 50:30.217
Oh, sounds fun.

50:30.251 --> 50:31.553
You and Collin
are gonna be there, right?

50:31.585 --> 50:34.321
Wouldn't miss it.
He might, though.

50:34.355 --> 50:36.391
I just... I never know
what's going on with that boy.

50:40.628 --> 50:42.730
- I'll give this to Lisa.
- Thank you.

50:42.762 --> 50:44.465
You're welcome.

50:55.775 --> 50:57.911
How am I gonna run this place
without you?

50:57.945 --> 51:02.884
Hey,
you're gonna kick ass as usual.

51:03.951 --> 51:06.387
- Yeah.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

51:52.365 --> 51:54.969
Hey, it's time for bed, pumpkin.

51:55.001 --> 51:56.570
Can you tell Aunt Katie
good night?

51:56.603 --> 52:00.741
- Good night, Aunt Katie.
- Good night, sweetheart.

52:00.775 --> 52:04.012
Wrap those arms.
Okay, got it.

52:04.045 --> 52:05.713
Okay, let's go.

52:11.018 --> 52:13.420
Oh, no. Uh, what time is it?

52:13.454 --> 52:15.890
Um, I'm so sorry I have to go.

52:15.922 --> 52:19.860
- Uh...
- Okay, bye.

52:29.570 --> 52:30.872
Katie.

52:33.773 --> 52:36.943
Katie. Hey, Katie.

53:07.474 --> 53:10.545
It's his last jab.
Don't get angry. That's what he wants.

53:10.577 --> 53:12.045
They all want you to be upset.

53:12.079 --> 53:16.084
And why shouldn't I be?
It's my fault.

53:17.585 --> 53:19.820
I knew something was off
with Katie.

53:19.853 --> 53:23.523
Ever since her mom died, she's been
drifting further and further away

53:23.556 --> 53:26.794
and I was too busy with you
and Arcadia to be a good friend.

53:28.829 --> 53:31.432
- Fuck.
- It's not your fault.

53:31.465 --> 53:34.902
Her choices aren't your problem.
She's a grown woman.

53:34.934 --> 53:38.539
What matters is that her stupid
decisions don't come back and hurt us.

53:41.608 --> 53:44.378
Yeah, okay.

53:44.411 --> 53:46.513
Mommy?

53:46.547 --> 53:48.516
- You want to take care of that?
- She's calling you, man.

53:50.583 --> 53:52.085
I'll take the next one,
I promise.

53:52.119 --> 53:53.555
Okay.

53:56.856 --> 53:58.893
What is it, baby?

53:58.925 --> 54:04.097
- Do you have a mommy and daddy?
- Yes, but they live far away.

54:04.130 --> 54:07.402
Does daddy have a mommy
and daddy?

54:07.434 --> 54:10.572
- He has a daddy.
- Where is he?

54:14.641 --> 54:17.110
No, absolutely fucking not.

54:17.143 --> 54:19.847
- Just think about it, okay?
- No.

54:20.780 --> 54:25.585
We can't project our issues with your family
on to her, she doesn't know any better.

54:25.619 --> 54:28.823
I mean, we knew this would happen
at some point, we talked about it.

54:28.856 --> 54:32.794
She can meet your family here and then
my family at some point down the road.

54:32.827 --> 54:36.431
Okay, and what if she comes back
and she wants to do Jesus shit?

54:41.068 --> 54:45.473
Then we let her do Jesus shit.
We talked about that too.

54:49.643 --> 54:52.813
Of course, this would happen
as soon as we're about to leave.

54:57.184 --> 54:59.554
Maybe it's for the best.

54:59.586 --> 55:01.855
I can watch her
while we wrap her presents.

55:01.889 --> 55:07.461
When we finish setting up for the party,
they meet her now and then we're gone.

55:16.070 --> 55:18.873
- We're gonna be back, you go to bed, okay?
- Okay.

55:18.905 --> 55:21.174
- We'll be back.
- Well, look who it is.

55:21.208 --> 55:24.177
No, not them. This is a major
breach of our trust, Michael...

55:24.210 --> 55:26.546
We are leaving, Thomas.
We're leaving.

55:26.579 --> 55:28.548
It's a beautiful little girl
you got there.

55:28.581 --> 55:30.717
We show up 30 minutes late
so you wouldn't pull this shit.

55:30.751 --> 55:33.221
We're sorry. We are very,
very sorry and we are leaving.

55:33.253 --> 55:34.822
Uh-huh,
it doesn't fucking look like it.

55:36.222 --> 55:37.858
Watch your mouth, boy.

55:37.891 --> 55:40.260
- What the hell? I thought we had an agreement.
- Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:40.293 --> 55:42.596
We just lost track of time.

55:44.231 --> 55:49.070
Is that Arcadia? Oh, hello there.
I'm your Aunty Georgine.

55:49.103 --> 55:51.072
Hello.

55:51.105 --> 55:56.510
And look, this is your uncle Michael.
Let's wave at him. Hi.

55:56.543 --> 56:00.780
So do you like teddy bears?
What about puzzles?

56:00.813 --> 56:03.817
Great. Well, we're gonna go right
inside, your grandfather's in there.

56:03.851 --> 56:06.521
He's so excited to meet you.

56:07.588 --> 56:10.191
We'll be back by nine.
She usually passes out around eight.

56:10.224 --> 56:12.494
Okay.
I'll let Georgine know.

56:49.697 --> 56:53.735
- She's quite good with children.
- Yes, she is.

56:55.001 --> 56:56.670
She'll make a good mother.

57:01.675 --> 57:04.879
I do wish
they'd hurry up and conceive.

57:06.313 --> 57:09.217
I'm afraid they're not trying
as often as they should.

57:15.889 --> 57:18.826
All right,
who's ready for dinner?

57:20.728 --> 57:23.364
Guess what we're having for
dessert, Arcadia? Birthday cake.

57:23.396 --> 57:26.199
- Ah! Oh, yeah!
- Yay, heh!

57:26.233 --> 57:30.071
Yes. It's chocolate..

57:36.777 --> 57:39.380
I'll slip out while she's distracted.
We'll be back at nine.

57:39.413 --> 57:41.583
Uh, thank you again.

57:55.795 --> 57:59.332
You know, you'll never learn
unless you practice.

57:59.365 --> 58:02.936
You gotta let me master cutting the
paper before I can move on to wrapping.

58:04.405 --> 58:06.074
Cut some paper then.

58:09.976 --> 58:12.679
I think, it went pretty well
given how it all started.

58:12.713 --> 58:14.048
Yeah, me too.

58:14.981 --> 58:17.217
I think,
Father watches them fuck.

58:17.251 --> 58:19.120
Oh, yeah, for sure.

58:20.086 --> 58:23.391
- Has he always done that?
- I try not to think about it.

58:24.692 --> 58:27.228
- It's fucking gross.
- Yeah.

58:37.771 --> 58:40.908
Did you see the bruises
on Katie's neck?

58:40.940 --> 58:42.676
No, I didn't notice.

58:44.010 --> 58:47.213
He's just as much
a piece of shit as always.

58:47.246 --> 58:49.750
She knew that. I just...
I don't understand.

58:49.782 --> 58:52.920
Jess, there's nothing
you can do for her right now.

58:53.853 --> 58:57.323
You know better than anyone else that
she has to figure things out for herself

58:57.356 --> 58:59.293
and make her own decisions.

59:07.266 --> 59:08.368
All done.

59:09.436 --> 59:12.340
- And you didn't even need me.
- Heh, that's true.

59:39.398 --> 59:42.902
Okay, just, uh, promise me
that we're gonna hire a babysitter soon.

59:42.936 --> 59:46.039
- That is a promise.
- And actually have a date night 'cause...

59:46.072 --> 59:47.775
Amen to that.

59:49.476 --> 59:52.079
- What the hell?
- What's going on?

59:52.112 --> 59:54.815
- I have no idea.
- Oh, my God.

59:54.847 --> 59:56.016
Something is wrong.

59:56.048 --> 59:58.384
Arcadia!

59:58.418 --> 1:00:01.756
Oh, Thomas. Jessica.

1:00:01.789 --> 1:00:04.024
- Georgine, what's going on?
- We can't find her. We can't find her.

1:00:04.056 --> 1:00:06.526
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

1:00:06.559 --> 1:00:08.862
- We can't find Arcadia.
- Let me find.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.364
- You can't.
- Let me find.

1:00:10.396 --> 1:00:11.798
- It's forbidden.
- Watch me.

1:00:11.831 --> 1:00:12.365
- Arcadia.
- Arcadia.

1:00:12.398 --> 1:00:14.400
No! No!

1:02:57.063 --> 1:02:58.965
She's asleep.

1:02:58.998 --> 1:03:00.634
- Is she...
- She's great, Katie.

1:03:01.635 --> 1:03:03.370
Don't talk to me like that.

1:03:03.402 --> 1:03:05.505
- I'm only trying to be...
- What, a friend?

1:03:05.539 --> 1:03:07.574
Is that what you think you are?

1:03:07.606 --> 1:03:10.710
- Well...
- Don't pretend like you're not here on their orders,

1:03:10.744 --> 1:03:13.447
just to see if we've figured out
what really happened.

1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:18.418
- Thomas, it was an accident.
- You weren't there.

1:03:18.452 --> 1:03:22.389
- You just believe in what they told you.
- You used to believe them too.

1:03:22.422 --> 1:03:27.327
You used to believe everything.
Then you left.

1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:29.663
Are you really surprised
by what's happened to you?

1:03:29.695 --> 1:03:32.165
The prodigal son
has wandered off the path.

1:03:36.769 --> 1:03:38.672
Looks like that hurts.

1:03:38.704 --> 1:03:40.641
Good to know Seth is doing well though..

1:03:46.278 --> 1:03:48.282
Her name was Arcadia.

1:03:51.518 --> 1:03:55.188
Katie,
do you know that name means?

1:03:58.358 --> 1:04:04.365
Unspoiled paradise.
And she was.

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:09.971
She really, really was.

1:04:15.742 --> 1:04:17.577
And now she's gone.

1:04:20.079 --> 1:04:21.348
Why is that?

1:04:31.090 --> 1:04:32.259
Why?

1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:36.496
Tell me, Katie?

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:43.070
She was all we lived for.

1:04:46.773 --> 1:04:48.642
Now she's gone.

1:04:50.110 --> 1:04:52.313
She's fucking gone.

1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:58.652
And the only thing keeping me
from just fucking ending it...

1:05:00.619 --> 1:05:04.157
is that I need to know
what happened.

1:05:05.157 --> 1:05:08.429
I need to know why my baby girl
was taken from me.

1:05:11.164 --> 1:05:14.168
Why you people killed my girl?

1:05:32.284 --> 1:05:36.489
Katie, if you're in there,
if Jess' best friend is still in there...

1:05:38.190 --> 1:05:39.793
you owe us answers.

1:05:46.398 --> 1:05:48.368
I know you've had
a hard time lately.

1:05:49.869 --> 1:05:53.507
And you need to find a way
to survive in this town,

1:05:53.539 --> 1:05:57.478
a way to feel loved
and to be a part of something,

1:05:57.510 --> 1:06:00.280
and I'm glad you found it,
I really am.

1:06:04.751 --> 1:06:09.323
But our little girl's dead.
She's not coming back.

1:06:10.389 --> 1:06:15.828
You get to keep living your
life, that's what we're gonna do.

1:06:15.862 --> 1:06:20.800
But it's gonna be really hard if we
don't know how or why it happened.

1:06:23.202 --> 1:06:24.605
Katie, please.

1:06:32.646 --> 1:06:35.682
"Do not withhold punishment
from a child.

1:06:35.715 --> 1:06:38.919
If you strike him with a rod,
he will not die.

1:06:38.952 --> 1:06:42.323
If you strike him with a rod,
you will save his soul."

1:07:11.952 --> 1:07:13.654
Did you want to come?

1:07:15.889 --> 1:07:19.626
What is that you want, Jessica?
Is it... is it answers?

1:07:20.793 --> 1:07:22.895
I...

1:07:22.929 --> 1:07:26.867
Oh, there, there.
That's what we're here for.

1:07:26.900 --> 1:07:30.637
We give people what they need even
when they don't know they need it.

1:07:31.605 --> 1:07:33.907
Emeth has been so good to me.

1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:41.514
Emeth has given me comfort
and purpose, meaning

1:07:41.547 --> 1:07:46.452
and it will continue to do that
as long as it still stands

1:07:46.485 --> 1:07:49.656
long after you and I
have left this mortal world.

1:07:56.862 --> 1:08:00.366
I swore an oath
to my husband,

1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:05.806
an oath that binds me to stand
behind him no matter what,

1:08:05.838 --> 1:08:10.311
even when that means
standing behind his lies.

1:08:14.447 --> 1:08:17.551
Such as when he goes to bed
with another man all the while

1:08:17.583 --> 1:08:21.554
preaching against
the sins of homosexuality.

1:08:26.559 --> 1:08:31.965
Seth goaded my husband,
his lover,

1:08:31.997 --> 1:08:34.600
into hitting Arcadia
as punishment,

1:08:34.634 --> 1:08:37.804
something that had
never happened to her before.

1:08:37.837 --> 1:08:42.943
She ran terrified from the house
and Seth...

1:08:47.479 --> 1:08:49.782
What happened was horrible.

1:08:51.016 --> 1:08:55.255
I can't even begin to imagine
the kind of pain that you're in.

1:09:00.627 --> 1:09:04.564
But again, he's my husband

1:09:04.596 --> 1:09:08.835
and I must submit to the life that
he and God have chosen for us.

1:09:12.404 --> 1:09:15.675
But although
I stand by his side,

1:09:16.676 --> 1:09:22.382
I must understand if God
or one of His servants on Earth

1:09:22.414 --> 1:09:26.452
chooses to punish my husband
for his wickedness.

1:09:38.931 --> 1:09:41.434
I've left a spare key
in the flowerpot.

1:09:42.368 --> 1:09:45.572
I'll be gone this weekend
visiting one of our new outlets.

1:09:47.474 --> 1:09:49.476
May God bless you
and be with you.

1:10:07.394 --> 1:10:08.494
Jess.

1:10:23.409 --> 1:10:25.612
Jess, listen to me, okay?

1:10:34.119 --> 1:10:36.090
I don't want to lose you.

1:10:43.863 --> 1:10:45.733
But if you want to go,

1:10:49.202 --> 1:10:51.070
I'll help you go.

1:10:54.140 --> 1:10:55.876
Just tell me...

1:10:58.478 --> 1:11:00.514
Just tell me how to help.

1:11:06.152 --> 1:11:09.523
- I want...
- Yeah.

1:11:11.757 --> 1:11:14.461
I want you to help me
make it right.

1:11:20.166 --> 1:11:22.636
Jess,
it won't bring our girl back.

1:11:25.939 --> 1:11:29.176
I know that, Thomas. I do.

1:11:33.011 --> 1:11:36.949
But I can't sit back and
watch them ruin any more lives.

1:11:39.185 --> 1:11:43.722
They come here,
they brainwash people,

1:11:43.756 --> 1:11:45.559
they hurt people.

1:11:46.893 --> 1:11:49.663
They're hypocrites
and murderers.

1:11:50.930 --> 1:11:52.032
Yeah.

1:11:54.199 --> 1:11:56.135
We are better than that.

1:11:58.104 --> 1:12:02.909
Are we? Are we?

1:12:05.677 --> 1:12:10.916
You were raised to believe that
there is some higher power

1:12:10.949 --> 1:12:13.987
that punishes people
who do evil.

1:12:15.822 --> 1:12:18.057
But where is this justice now?

1:12:20.592 --> 1:12:22.628
They need to be
held accountable.

1:12:29.769 --> 1:12:31.605
Remember what we always said,

1:12:32.738 --> 1:12:38.778
we'd be in this together
forever, no matter what.

1:12:40.947 --> 1:12:44.952
As long as we had happiness
together, we were good.

1:12:48.854 --> 1:12:51.257
And they took that away from us,

1:12:52.992 --> 1:12:57.064
time and time again.

1:13:01.868 --> 1:13:06.673
Please,
I can't do this without you.

1:13:16.783 --> 1:13:18.952
Up, now.

1:13:21.354 --> 1:13:22.623
Now!

1:13:52.318 --> 1:13:54.721
Say hi to Father, everyone.

1:14:02.996 --> 1:14:04.764
Daryll, what are you doing here,
man?

1:14:04.796 --> 1:14:07.701
It's nothing personal boss,
she just pays better.

1:14:22.148 --> 1:14:26.653
Boy, you ever held a gun before?

1:14:26.685 --> 1:14:28.121
There's no fucking way
he's held a gun before...

1:14:28.154 --> 1:14:30.724
Seth, please,
this is the Lord's house.

1:14:31.923 --> 1:14:35.127
Oh, is that your main concern
right now, my language?

1:14:38.163 --> 1:14:40.966
All right, I'll try.

1:14:43.368 --> 1:14:45.938
Well, don't you two make
a cute couple.

1:14:47.372 --> 1:14:50.743
Don't give me that look,
we know all about you two.

1:14:53.279 --> 1:14:56.650
What can I say, Jess,
I'm a good fuck.

1:14:59.118 --> 1:15:02.322
What about him?
Is he a good fuck?

1:15:03.389 --> 1:15:07.226
Doesn't look like it.
Guy seems like a limp dick pussy.

1:15:08.694 --> 1:15:11.831
No wonder your hands are shaking
on that fucking gun.

1:15:11.863 --> 1:15:16.035
You never had to do anything really your
entire fucking life. Oh, what are you gonna...

1:15:46.099 --> 1:15:49.936
Right, right.

1:15:49.969 --> 1:15:51.404
So

1:15:52.904 --> 1:15:56.876
I know you're a stickler
for the rules.

1:16:00.947 --> 1:16:03.216
Lot of verses in this book.

1:16:04.449 --> 1:16:09.422
Lot of verses
about homosexuality.

1:16:11.090 --> 1:16:13.760
It's a punishable sin, isn't it?

1:16:14.993 --> 1:16:19.264
Personally,
I think that's pretty extreme.

1:16:19.297 --> 1:16:22.801
It's so homophobic and hateful.

1:16:24.936 --> 1:16:28.175
There are so many worse things than
loving people, don't you think?

1:16:29.475 --> 1:16:32.412
Seth, nothing? Hmm.

1:16:35.448 --> 1:16:38.752
But they aren't my rules.

1:16:44.023 --> 1:16:45.492
They're yours.

1:16:46.859 --> 1:16:49.963
And I know how important it is
to Emeth

1:16:49.996 --> 1:16:53.400
that you be punished
when you break...

1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:58.438
What was it, Michael,
God's rules?

1:17:02.375 --> 1:17:06.912
Here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna untie you.

1:17:06.945 --> 1:17:10.949
Then you're gonna take these and you're
gonna stone this sodomite to death.

1:17:10.983 --> 1:17:12.786
God be praised.

1:17:17.189 --> 1:17:19.259
If you do this...

1:17:19.292 --> 1:17:24.898
hey, I promise,
I won't kill you.

1:17:25.832 --> 1:17:27.167
But if you refuse...

1:17:32.305 --> 1:17:33.840
Get the picture?

1:17:51.957 --> 1:17:54.059
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

1:18:00.298 --> 1:18:02.135
Again.

1:18:02.167 --> 1:18:05.871
Don't be afraid to get in there
and bash his fucking brains in.

1:18:17.483 --> 1:18:18.985
Shit.

1:18:35.467 --> 1:18:38.470
That's very good.
Very good.

1:18:39.604 --> 1:18:43.575
So Matthew 5:29.

1:18:43.609 --> 1:18:47.314
Do you know it?
Tell me.

1:18:50.048 --> 1:18:51.851
If your...

1:18:53.319 --> 1:18:57.157
If your right eye causes you to
sin, cut it out and throw it away.

1:19:01.293 --> 1:19:05.599
Very good.
You know what to do.

1:20:54.039 --> 1:20:57.143
No. No!

1:20:58.144 --> 1:21:01.047
"Touch not my anointed

1:21:02.581 --> 1:21:05.385
and do my prophets no harm."

1:21:07.219 --> 1:21:09.989
The psalms, really?

1:21:11.457 --> 1:21:13.026
Now I...

1:21:13.059 --> 1:21:16.162
I fully support
what you did to those boys.

1:21:17.363 --> 1:21:19.733
It was wonderfully rooted
in scripture.

1:21:22.068 --> 1:21:23.470
And if you...

1:21:24.436 --> 1:21:29.208
if you need any help
moving on from what happened,

1:21:31.243 --> 1:21:33.747
you have the full support
of Emeth behind you.

1:21:41.686 --> 1:21:43.655
Remember what
you used to say, Father,

1:21:45.591 --> 1:21:50.130
about how the boss is responsible
for the actions of his employees

1:21:51.396 --> 1:21:53.233
and must be held accountable?

1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:57.136
That's you, Father.

1:21:58.404 --> 1:22:01.508
Guilty by association.

1:22:16.387 --> 1:22:18.690
"If anyone should cause

1:22:20.326 --> 1:22:24.130
of these little ones harm...

1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:31.570
it would be better
that he have a millstone

1:22:31.604 --> 1:22:34.240
hung around his neck

1:22:34.273 --> 1:22:38.511
and that he be drowned
in the middle of the sea."

1:22:41.479 --> 1:22:43.582
Matthew 18:6.

1:22:54.592 --> 1:22:57.497
This won't destroy Emeth.

1:22:57.529 --> 1:23:00.766
There are thousands,
millions of us.

1:23:02.868 --> 1:23:05.305
We have no issue with them.

1:23:06.872 --> 1:23:09.509
We are concerned with those

1:23:09.542 --> 1:23:13.179
who've done harm to us

1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:17.717
and those that we love,

1:23:18.884 --> 1:23:24.256
the hypocrites who preach hate
and intolerance,

1:23:24.289 --> 1:23:26.626
mass as a path to fulfillment.

1:23:29.561 --> 1:23:35.400
You will never poison
another mind

1:23:35.434 --> 1:23:37.137
or life.
