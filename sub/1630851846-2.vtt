WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:05.179
So I bit him.

00:05.222 --> 00:08.269
I didn't know what else to do,
so I just bit him.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.967
And I feel like
that was the right move

00:11.011 --> 00:13.970
because he never charged me
for the guitar lesson.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.538
Okay! On to other business.

00:16.581 --> 00:19.149
We have an exciting
new villain...

00:19.193 --> 00:21.630
Anastasia Kirilenko.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.154
Kirilenko? That sounds Russian.

00:24.198 --> 00:27.288
That's right! The Russians
are doing shit again!

00:29.594 --> 00:32.206
The Russians?!
They dance like this.

00:32.249 --> 00:35.600
Hey! Ho! Hey! Ho!
Ha! Hey! Yeah, yeah!

00:35.644 --> 00:37.211
Yeah, yeah! Yeah!

00:37.254 --> 00:39.735
Ha ha! That's right, Styles!
They do!

00:39.778 --> 00:42.564
Jackson has painted a fresco
on the ceiling

00:42.607 --> 00:44.348
detailing the mission.

00:44.392 --> 00:48.178
Now, this is for you
visual learners and also for me,

00:48.222 --> 00:50.920
because I got bananas high
before this meeting.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.487
Jackson!

00:52.530 --> 00:55.359
We intercepted an order
from Kirilenko's IP address

00:55.403 --> 00:56.969
to the American Girl
doll store...

00:57.013 --> 00:58.188
Ohh!

00:58.232 --> 00:59.407
...where Kirilenko's daughter

00:59.450 --> 01:01.583
ordered a special,
one-of-a-kind doll.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.063
Hmm!

01:03.106 --> 01:05.282
The plan is
to put a bug in the doll...

01:05.326 --> 01:06.414
Dude.
...and ship it to

01:06.457 --> 01:08.807
-the Kirilenko compound.
Whoa.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.506
We'll finally be able
to listen in on the Russian mob.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.247
Yeah.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.511
We've coordinated
with American Girl,

01:16.554 --> 01:18.556
as we do on most missions,

01:18.600 --> 01:21.516
and they're giving us access to
the doll before it's delivered.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.692
We just need an agent
to go to the mall.

01:23.735 --> 01:24.867
- I got it!
- Oh! Me!

01:24.910 --> 01:26.279
I'll do anything
to get out of work.

01:26.303 --> 01:28.871
That's what I like to hear!

01:28.914 --> 01:32.440
Pick up the doll.
Bring it to work Monday morning.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.529
I will be busy all weekend,

01:34.572 --> 01:37.488
posing for my deputy director
portrait.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.361

Steve, why are you hanging

02:23.230 --> 02:25.971
Uhh, this is my high school,
Dad.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.713
You <i>just</i> met Mr. Brink
at my parent-teacher conference.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.237
I thought that was your foreman.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.195
No wonder he wouldn't show me
his jackhammer.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.849
Well, punch out
and let's go to the mall.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.461
Were you just listening
to the boy band I was in?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.047
Yeah, they've been playing it
a lot recently

02:39.071 --> 02:40.353
since some psychopath's
been murdering

02:40.377 --> 02:42.162
all the band members one by one.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.946
I <i>have</i> been getting
a lot more calls

02:43.989 --> 02:45.948
that are just heaving breathing
lately.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.776
I thought it was Barry.

02:49.430 --> 02:52.041
I'm sorry we have to go
to this lame doll store.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.174
These dolls are amazing.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.045
Did you know
each American Girl doll

02:56.088 --> 02:58.003
has a rich historical backstory?

02:58.047 --> 02:59.242
I don't like
where this is going.

02:59.266 --> 03:02.094
This is Koko. She's from Hawaii.

03:02.138 --> 03:05.054
"Her aloha spirit
kept her family together

03:05.097 --> 03:08.188
on that fateful December morning
in 1941,

03:08.231 --> 03:10.494
when the bombs fell
from the <i>lani."</i>

03:10.538 --> 03:12.192
That's Hawaiian for "sky."

03:12.235 --> 03:16.457
No shit. Steve, you're a boy.
And boys don't play with dolls.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.893
How about Helena?

03:17.936 --> 03:21.331
Her family died of dysentery
during the Civil War.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.681
Dad! Hasn't Helena
been through enough?!

03:23.725 --> 03:26.728
Look at my foot.
It has been put down.

03:28.904 --> 03:32.647
Hi! I'm Bob, and this is
my best friend, Maisie!

03:35.171 --> 03:39.131
Ooh! The one-of-a-kind
Piper special edition!

03:39.175 --> 03:41.525
"You're one lucky boy!"

03:41.569 --> 03:42.787
It's not for him!

03:42.831 --> 03:46.574
Ohh.
A fellow adult doll enthusiast.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.054
We should
get together and play sometime.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.321
<i>From the creators
of "Young Sheldon" comes...</i>

03:54.364 --> 03:56.018
<i>"Even Younger Sheldon."</i>

03:56.061 --> 03:57.585
Yuck. It's just a fetus.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.239
<i>I get out of here throughwhere?</i>

03:59.282 --> 04:01.284
<i>Uh, no, thank you.</i>

04:03.721 --> 04:06.420
I just had the tightest dinner
with Jurgen.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.597
We destroyed
the Chimdale Ruth's Chris.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.599
What gives, Klaus?
You never have any money.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.253
It was Jurgen's treat.

04:13.296 --> 04:16.778
I did his taxes and got him
a three-figure refund.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.128
I didn't know you did taxes.
Can you help me with mine?

04:19.171 --> 04:22.305
Sure. You thinking standard
or itemized deduction?

04:22.349 --> 04:26.004
Those are the <i>exact</i> types of
questions I'm trying to avoid.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.964
And that's how I know Jackson
is having a jazz party tonight.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.662
Can you believe he didn't
skee-bop-ba-doo-bop-invite me?

04:31.706 --> 04:36.450
Uh-huh. So Dr. Weitzman switched
yours and Jeff's consciousness?!

04:36.493 --> 04:38.234
Yeah, Mom.
This is me... Hayley.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.235
The crazy thing is...

04:39.279 --> 04:41.063
And this is for couples therapy?

04:41.106 --> 04:42.456
Can we get back to my...

04:42.499 --> 04:44.806
Babe, I think I got your period.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.808
I understand you now.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.811
I just had to walk a mile
in your tampon.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.770
No one cares about my problems.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.207
Oh! I forgot you were up there.

04:55.251 --> 04:58.341
Just like Jackson forgot
to invite me to his jazz party.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.038
Or maybe it was on purpose.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.127
This is ridiculous!
I'm talking to a doll!

05:08.220 --> 05:10.092
A little dark in there.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.790
Now I see on Instagram

05:12.834 --> 05:15.271
Hooper is having
a bluegrass thing right now!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.665
He <i>wanted</i> me to see it!
He tagged me!

05:17.708 --> 05:19.580
I'm acting like a crazy person.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.321
You can't hear me
through that box.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.541
Hi.

05:26.891 --> 05:30.286
Good morning USA, Piper.
Whatcha got there?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.462
Oh, right, you're an orphan
from the Depression era

05:32.506 --> 05:34.725
and you write poetry
for scraps of food.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.640
These are really good.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.294
Did you squiggle them yourself?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.123
You know, I wrote a poem once,
about ham.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.646
But it didn't go very well.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.344
My friend fake-humped me

05:44.387 --> 05:47.390
and then took the ham-carving
position I wanted.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.088
Has that ever happened to you
with your poetry, Piper?

05:51.481 --> 05:53.048
Where's your dad?

05:53.091 --> 05:55.833
And then I saw another guy
last week that was like 6'4"!

05:55.877 --> 05:57.139
I don't know if I'm just lucky

05:57.182 --> 05:58.880
or if it's something
about the store,

05:58.923 --> 06:01.796
but I always see
really tall guys at Home Depot.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.802
Smith? Where's the doll?!

06:07.845 --> 06:09.586
O-Oh, my God.
I totally forgot I had it.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.979
Senior moment.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.609
I-I think the problem is
that I don't care

06:12.633 --> 06:14.199
about that amazing doll at all.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.418
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.333
Sorry about the, uh...
pbht! brain fart!

06:17.377 --> 06:20.336
Good fart noise, Smith!

06:22.469 --> 06:24.601
So, I told our joke at... oh...

06:24.645 --> 06:27.517
at work today,
and everybody laughed!

06:30.215 --> 06:31.279
So, you see,
these tax write-offs

06:31.303 --> 06:32.827
that you've grouped together,

06:32.870 --> 06:36.570
I spread them over two
categories and saved you $15.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.833
$15?! Wow!

06:38.876 --> 06:41.966
I'm gonna have so much change
to take to Nipples and Nickels,

06:42.010 --> 06:43.814
the only strip club
that lets you tip in nickels.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.622
By the way,
can I get that in nickels?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.537
They don't make change
at Nipples and Nickels.

06:47.581 --> 06:50.192
Furthermore, I'm
recommending you to everyone.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.760
I-I don't know if I have time
for any more clients!

06:52.803 --> 06:54.457
Raider Dave!

06:54.501 --> 06:57.155
Tax question...
If I beat a man with a tire iron

06:57.199 --> 06:59.723
in the stadium parking lot,
is that deductible?

06:59.767 --> 07:01.464
I'll have to look into it.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.292
If it makes a difference,
he started it.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.034
His wife and small children
were wearing Broncos jerseys...

07:06.077 --> 07:07.427
in Denver, no less.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.429
That's Raider country!

07:12.910 --> 07:16.261
Hey, Steve! Agent Styles!

07:16.305 --> 07:18.133
I know your dad's
been out sick for a week,

07:18.176 --> 07:20.483
and clearly you've caught it,
whatever it is,

07:20.527 --> 07:21.895
but I need to get something
from him.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.139
Rogu.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.620
Whoa! You sound like shit!

07:29.318 --> 07:31.668
I so treasure these talks
with you, Piper.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.323
The world's greatest treasure
is found

07:34.366 --> 07:36.194
in the words of friendship.

07:36.238 --> 07:39.763
Wow, Piper! Only you can make
Smash Mouth lyrics...

07:39.807 --> 07:42.287
which I assume those were...
sound so beautiful.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.506
Stan?

07:43.550 --> 07:46.204
Styles!
What are you doing in Paris?!

07:49.120 --> 07:50.560
Okay.
Uh, what were we talking about?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.646
Sports cars, right?
My favorite is Lamborghini.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.691
It's <i>so</i> fast.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.650
What the hell is going on
with you, Stan?

07:56.693 --> 07:58.129
Okay. Let me explain.

07:58.173 --> 08:01.437
Like most flashbacks,
this one starts in the past.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.352
<i>After my dad left,</i>

08:03.395 --> 08:05.789
<i>my mother had to raise me
all on her own.</i>

08:05.833 --> 08:07.182
<i>Without a dad to guide me,</i>

08:07.225 --> 08:09.489
<i>she was afraid
I'd turn out too girly.</i>

08:09.532 --> 08:11.142
<i>So she had very strict rules</i>

08:11.186 --> 08:12.622
<i>about what boys could play with.</i>

08:12.666 --> 08:14.711
Aah!

08:16.583 --> 08:18.149
Aah!

08:22.850 --> 08:25.940
I thought I told you
to throw out that stupid doll!

08:25.983 --> 08:27.724
But she's my best friend!

08:27.768 --> 08:31.380
Look at my foot.
It has been put down.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.729
Aah!

08:34.339 --> 08:36.341
So I guess that's why I went...

08:36.385 --> 08:38.387
a little overboard
with all this.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.520
I've been keeping this inside
for way too long.

08:40.563 --> 08:43.000
But now I've had a breakthrough.
I'm all better!

08:43.044 --> 08:44.219
Just like that?

08:44.262 --> 08:46.526
I guess I'm just
super-healthy mentally.

08:46.569 --> 08:50.051
Here.
This doll needs to go to Russia.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.661
You have a lovely home.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.882
I guess I should tidy up.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.581
Oh. Huh. Piper left her jacket.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.845
♪ <i>It's overdue</i> ♪

09:01.889 --> 09:03.368
<i>That was B12,</i>

09:03.412 --> 09:05.806
<i>now with only seven
surviving members!</i>

09:05.849 --> 09:06.894
Piper needs her jacket!

09:06.937 --> 09:08.591
Aah!

09:11.681 --> 09:14.597
You can't be trusted with Piper!
You're a terrible driver!

09:16.904 --> 09:19.167
When I saw
you'd left your jacket,

09:19.210 --> 09:21.604
I realized you were
sending me a message.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.389
You didn't want to go any more
than I wanted you to leave.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.870
It's all true, Stan!

09:26.914 --> 09:30.395
Piper, you're the best
doll friend I've ever had.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.833
I can't let you go
now that I've found you.

09:32.876 --> 09:36.010
Stan, the CIA <i>really</i> wants me
to go to Russia.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.229
They're probably
gonna come after me.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.884
If I know the CIA,
they'll be after me, as well.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.364
They'll think
this is all <i>my</i> idea.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.061
They don't know anything
about friendship.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.193
We need to run.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.108
Yeah. We'll lie low
for a few years,

09:47.151 --> 09:49.066
then I'll come back
for Francine and Rogu.

09:54.071 --> 09:57.031
Did you have any unusual
expenses this year?

09:57.074 --> 09:58.946
Got a full penis tattoo
of Dale Earnhardt.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.251
Totally butchered it.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.036
Looks like Milhouse
from <i>The Simpsons.</i>

10:02.079 --> 10:04.691
I accidentally ejaculated
on a Nagel painting

10:04.734 --> 10:06.407
and was forced to purchase it
from the museum.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.303
Neigh!

10:08.346 --> 10:12.394
Did you receive unreported
tip income of $20 or more?

10:12.437 --> 10:14.091
I have no need for a job.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.920
I exchange smoothies
for used clothes.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.053
I received a trampoline
as a business gift

10:19.096 --> 10:21.664
from a prostitute
I am deeply in love with.

10:21.708 --> 10:25.581
Did you make any... contributions
to a retirement plan?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.670
- No.
- No.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.411
No.

10:29.454 --> 10:32.806
And roughly what was your income
this year?

10:32.849 --> 10:35.591
Mama gives me a nickel
if I don't touch myself!

10:35.635 --> 10:37.874
Where were you the night of the
Sadie Hawkins dance haunting?

10:37.898 --> 10:39.116
Aah!

10:39.160 --> 10:41.292
Ricky Spanish.

10:41.336 --> 10:44.034
Sorry. I couldn't hear you
over the stabbing.

10:44.078 --> 10:46.689
How much did you say you donated
to the Audubon Society?

10:46.733 --> 10:51.955
$17,428.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.527
I'm gonna buy you
some sugar cereal,

10:58.570 --> 11:00.355
but it's only because
we're on vacation.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.922
<i>Now we have some breaking news.</i>

11:01.965 --> 11:04.011
<i>This just in from
Langley Falls, Virginia.</i>

11:04.054 --> 11:05.926
<i>Here's a picture
of the suspects,</i>

11:05.969 --> 11:08.189
<i>who are still at large.</i>

11:08.232 --> 11:09.669
Sorry. That just went off.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.366
By the way,
that was not me on the TV,

11:11.409 --> 11:13.542
this is a normal doll,
and I'm a normal man.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.893
Now, where do you keep your hair
dye, like, for normal disguises?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.331
Well, Stan,
you've done it again.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.812
Your most fiendishly clever
disguise yet.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.945
Even my own family
would never suspect

11:24.988 --> 11:26.773
that I'm not Barry Manilow.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.475
It's all worth it.

11:33.518 --> 11:36.391
Such a little angel.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.572
Did your... friend
not like her eggs?

11:43.615 --> 11:45.655
What are you talking about?
She ate the whole thing.

11:50.057 --> 11:54.148
Let's pay cash. Don't want
the CIA tracking my card.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.802
You're right. No huge tips.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.978
Don't want to end up a segment
on the local news.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.110
Let me just do
a quick Yelp review.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.590
I found Stan!

12:03.592 --> 12:05.463
And he's driving west on 68!

12:09.206 --> 12:10.468
What the...

12:15.517 --> 12:17.998
I have access to your memories!

12:20.914 --> 12:22.785
No!
She doesn't like it in there!

12:22.829 --> 12:25.005
She's going to Russia, Smith.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.529
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

12:27.572 --> 12:29.096
Putting the hose down.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.103
Doll is lost!

12:40.020 --> 12:41.804
What's wrong, Stan?

12:41.848 --> 12:44.938
Oh, Towel Swan, I don't know.
Am I becoming unhinged?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.635
What?! No!

12:46.678 --> 12:49.725
You're as hinged as a door, bro.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.596
You need to go find Piper.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.685
But she's halfway to Russia
already!

12:53.729 --> 12:57.951
This isn't the Stan I know.
This looks like a crybaby.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.954
I'm not a crybaby!
But I'm just one man.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.305
I can't go halfway to Russia
all by myself. I need a team.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.263
Don't worry.
We'll help you, Stan.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.921
♪ <i>We'll help Stan,
he's our friend... ♪</i>

13:11.965 --> 13:13.575
Shut up! Piper's missing!

13:13.618 --> 13:15.838
Sorry. You guys are great.
Don't get me wrong.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.319
But I need you to hang back here
at headquarters

13:18.362 --> 13:20.190
while I put a team together
to get her.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.497
Wait. Say that again.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.761
Get a team together...
to get her.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.329
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

13:30.374 --> 13:31.854
I need you for a job,

13:31.898 --> 13:34.465
and word is you've got
the résumé I'm looking for...

13:34.509 --> 13:38.513
Special Forces, black ops,
67 confirmed kills.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.820
I left that life behind.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.692
Then I guess I'll have to
save Piper by myself.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.520
Piper's in trouble?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.783
Well, why the hell
didn't you say so?

13:54.268 --> 13:56.487
What took you so long?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.978
I'm in, baby.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.637
We'll bring the sweet tea.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.557
That'll be $6,000.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.565
Hi. I need eight tickets
to Moscow. First class.

14:32.088 --> 14:35.309
Ooh. We only have seven
first-class seats available.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.196
There.
Now that I've framed my poster,

14:53.240 --> 14:56.417
this finally feels like
a grown-up's alcove.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.027
I should have a dinner party.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.160
Klaus Heisler,
you're in big trouble!

15:00.203 --> 15:01.726
What?! What's this about?

15:01.770 --> 15:04.555
Maynard Butterbean, IRS auditor.

15:04.599 --> 15:08.690
You've been convicted of filing
147 fraudulent tax returns.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.953
Convicted?
D-Don't I get a trial?

15:10.997 --> 15:14.391
A trial? This isn't TV, bro.
You're going to jail!

15:14.435 --> 15:17.786
I-I'll admit, I took a few
liberties, but everyone does it.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.136
This isn't cocaine, sir.
Not everyone does this.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.877
We're seizing all your assets.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.966
Assets? I don't have any...

15:24.010 --> 15:25.489
No!

15:27.013 --> 15:29.754
I spent $700 at Aaron Brothers
getting that framed!

15:29.798 --> 15:31.539
Hit him with the Tasers, boys.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.672
Roger, you jerk.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.414
Are you busy Saturday?

15:37.458 --> 15:39.373
I'm having
a little dinner party.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.550
I'll be there.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.516
There's no <i>dying</i> in baseball.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.215
Emma, you're in
a league of your own.

16:04.441 --> 16:05.877
How are we gonna get past them?

16:05.921 --> 16:09.055
Me and Debbie can handle
those cold-blooded Russians.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.534
Hey, boys!

16:17.106 --> 16:18.934
You're a miracle on ice.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.726
Shh!

16:28.770 --> 16:31.207
Bad timing on that squeaky fart.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.470
You're a dead man, Amerikanskiy.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.777
Uh, I think my friend Madison

16:35.820 --> 16:38.040
might have something to say
about that.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.390
Aw, yeah!

16:40.434 --> 16:43.176
I'm comin' to get ya!

16:47.223 --> 16:50.835
Your American car is no match
for our Russian wall.

16:54.274 --> 16:57.103
Wow. I thought Russians
were supposed to be tough.

17:01.281 --> 17:04.936
Damn it. I brought seven dolls
but only two bullets.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.460
You're all out of bullets...

17:06.503 --> 17:08.114
all out of dolls...

17:08.157 --> 17:10.420
and all out of luck.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.856
That's where you're wrong.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.468
I don't need luck,
because I have Mai.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.947
Get him, Mai!

17:15.991 --> 17:17.471
Hahhh!

17:22.389 --> 17:24.478
Russians be trippin'.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.307
Piper! Where are you?

17:33.139 --> 17:36.359
Zoya Kirilenko.
Anastasia's daughter.

17:36.403 --> 17:40.276
Oh, Piper,
I have had such a tough day.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.497
What's that? Oh, thank you!

17:43.540 --> 17:45.499
You always know
just what to say.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.893
Here you are.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.243
I thought I told you

17:50.286 --> 17:52.158
- to throw out that stupid doll!
- But, Mother!

17:52.201 --> 17:55.074
You will run this organization
when I'm gone,

17:55.117 --> 17:58.599
but you'll never be a leader
of men if you play with dolls.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.079
I can do both!

18:00.122 --> 18:03.647
Look at my foot.
It has been put down.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.478
Where were you when I farted?

18:11.438 --> 18:13.092
You came back for me!

18:13.135 --> 18:15.311
Of course I did.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.836
I can tell by the look
on your face something's wrong.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.664
According to
the American Girl Feelings Book,

18:20.708 --> 18:22.231
you're concerned
about something,

18:22.275 --> 18:25.800
like speaking up in class
or saying hi to the new girl.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.193
What is it, Stan?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.934
Piper, you've filled a hole
in my life

18:29.978 --> 18:33.199
that my wife, children, SUV,
and alien never could.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.939
Aww. That's so sweet.

18:34.983 --> 18:37.725
But I can tell there's something
you're not saying.

18:37.768 --> 18:41.468
I've realized there's someone
who needs you more than I do.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.907
Piper! You're back!

18:45.950 --> 18:47.604
Treat her well.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.737
Thank you. I will.

18:49.780 --> 18:53.132
She's got a milk allergy,
so she only drinks Diet Sprite.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.830
And she can't sleep without
her Blake Griffin plushy.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.398
Yeah, I know. It's on her box.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.315
Bye, Piper.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.099
Goodbye, Stan.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.191
Oh. I'm not crazy anymore.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.802
She's all yours.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.978
But what about my mother?
She said...

19:14.022 --> 19:16.981
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about your mother anymore.

19:19.419 --> 19:23.292
Imagine... a mother who wouldn't
let her child play with dolls.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.321
Good thing there's not more
than one way to mess up a kid.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.876
- You did it, Smith!
- I know.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.399
Piper has a great new home

19:43.443 --> 19:45.923
with a girl that loves her
just as much as I did.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.752
No, I mean getting the bug
back in the house

19:48.796 --> 19:50.972
and taking out Kirilenko.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.975
Now when the daughter
takes over the organization,

19:54.018 --> 19:56.195
we'll know their every move.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.544
We're getting something!

19:59.154 --> 20:02.331
<i>Can I tell you a secret, Piper?</i>

20:02.375 --> 20:03.767
<i>I believe in mermaids.</i>

20:03.811 --> 20:06.770
This is great intel, Smith!

20:17.607 --> 20:19.174
Steve?

20:20.523 --> 20:21.916
Oh!

20:32.274 --> 20:35.321
Steve, I got you the American
Girl doll you've always wanted!

20:35.364 --> 20:37.323
Oh, Dad, it's okay.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.194
I'm... I'm not really
into that anymore.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.414
Son, I've realized I was wrong

20:41.457 --> 20:43.720
when I told you
boys couldn't play with dolls.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.983
So... play away.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.724
And put on this lipstick.

20:47.768 --> 20:50.031
Oh... kay.

20:50.074 --> 20:52.163
Mm.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.601
You're a good dad, Stan.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.300
Bye! Have a great time!
