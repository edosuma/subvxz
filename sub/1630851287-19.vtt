00:36.111 --> 00:38.262
-all the dishes and cleaning.
-No, no, Dad.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.113
You guys are Honeybee
and my guests tonight.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.690
You just relax
and enjoy digesting.

00:42.785 --> 00:43.876
-Well, thank you.
-Honeybee,

00:44.027 --> 00:45.860
that lasagna was
"Under the Tuscan Yum."

00:46.029 --> 00:47.028
Glad you liked it.

00:47.197 --> 00:49.048
I'm trying to branch out
from layered dips,

00:49.275 --> 00:51.108
so other layered foods seemed
like a good place to start.

00:51.126 --> 00:53.701
Well, I couldn't stop dipping
my fork into it,

00:53.721 --> 00:54.961
my Glamorous Garfield.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.388
Having us over for dinner,

00:56.615 --> 00:58.390
chaperoning our field trip
tomorrow--

00:58.542 --> 01:01.209
Wolf, you're really turning into
an Adult Arnold on us.

01:01.287 --> 01:03.044
You know it.
I can't wait to be your guide

01:03.064 --> 01:05.898
on the abandoned Death Cliff
Prison field trip-a-roo.

01:06.049 --> 01:08.049
Still one of
my all-time favorite FTs

01:08.069 --> 01:09.234
from when I was in high school.

01:09.386 --> 01:10.961
I've been browsing
their gift shop online

01:10.979 --> 01:11.978
since I heard about
the field trip,

01:12.131 --> 01:13.238
and I'm torn about what I want:

01:13.407 --> 01:15.056
a bar of soap
with a tiny prisoner inside

01:15.076 --> 01:16.316
that you free when you wash

01:16.468 --> 01:17.743
or a throw pillow that says,

01:17.894 --> 01:19.227
"Wherever you go,
you're in jail."

01:19.396 --> 01:21.080
And Crispin and I get
to walk around all day together.

01:21.307 --> 01:23.640
We do a lot of standing
and sitting together,

01:23.733 --> 01:24.658
but walking?

01:24.810 --> 01:26.977
Uh, this is kind of huge for us.

01:26.995 --> 01:28.570
I'm sad my grade
doesn't get to go,

01:28.589 --> 01:31.239
but Dad and I are gonna head out
into the woods tomorrow morning

01:31.258 --> 01:33.074
and work on earning
my bird-watching patch

01:33.168 --> 01:35.502
-for Lil' Preppers.
-Ah! Is that the time?

01:35.596 --> 01:36.987
Ham, we got to go!

01:37.080 --> 01:38.597
<i> Dakota: A Cowboy at College</i>
is on TV tonight,

01:38.766 --> 01:41.174
and we got to watch live
so we don't see any spoilers.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.993
I wonder if he's gonna
switch his boots

01:43.011 --> 01:43.936
for some real city shoes

01:44.087 --> 01:45.253
for his date with Taffiny
tonight.

01:45.347 --> 01:47.681
Oh, wait for me!
I'm ready for a heaping helping

01:47.775 --> 01:49.666
of that bucking biology major.

01:49.685 --> 01:51.443
Oh, babe, sorry,
you'll have to catch it later.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.186
Remember, we got to finish
filling out that paperwork

01:53.280 --> 01:55.689
to open our joint checking
account at the bank tomorrow.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.174
Crapple sauce. I forgot.

01:57.192 --> 01:59.934
Uh-oh.
Adult Arnold rides again.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.845
Come on,
I'm not that old, guys.

02:01.847 --> 02:03.622
I'm still just one of the sibs.

02:03.773 --> 02:04.939
(chuckles)
Look out.

02:05.033 --> 02:06.441
Old Man Tobin's cranky.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.942
Is that the sound
of an adult diaper

02:07.962 --> 02:09.444
filling up with rage diarrhea?

02:09.538 --> 02:11.779
(laughs) Oh, Wolf,
we're just teasing.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.132
(laughs):
Oh, yeah, sure.

02:13.359 --> 02:15.359
I can take a joke because
I'm not an old fuddy-duddy.

02:15.361 --> 02:17.043
-(overlapping farewells)
-Good night, you two.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.245
-(door closes)
-(whispers): Adult Arnold?

02:19.398 --> 02:20.806
A-Are those wrinkles?

02:21.033 --> 02:22.699
-Aah!
-First, you don't watch

02:22.868 --> 02:24.868
<i> Dakota: A Cowboy at College.</i>

02:24.961 --> 02:26.052
Then your teeth fall out,

02:26.205 --> 02:28.463
then you start farting
uncontrollably,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.874
and then you do the jitterbug
at your nephew's wedding

02:30.967 --> 02:32.317
and nobody wants to see that.

02:32.544 --> 02:33.968
And then your hearing
starts to go,

02:34.046 --> 02:35.912
and then your arms fall off,

02:35.914 --> 02:39.049
then you die... die... die.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.342
(screams)

02:41.495 --> 02:44.830
All righty, kids. Who's ready
to do some hard time?

02:44.981 --> 02:46.314
Oh, that didn't sound good.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.667
Soft time. Ugh,
that doesn't sound good either.

02:48.818 --> 02:50.076
I know last night I had to do

02:50.229 --> 02:52.245
boring adult bank
paperwork stuff,

02:52.339 --> 02:55.323
but today I'm
responsibility-free. (whoops)

02:55.401 --> 02:57.083
But aren't you our chaperone?

02:57.178 --> 02:59.011
More like a "fun-perone,"
young lady.

02:59.238 --> 03:01.513
-Oh, no.
-You know, when I went
on this field trip

03:01.665 --> 03:03.015
not that many years ago,

03:03.166 --> 03:05.242
my friend Cheesecake and I
snuck off on our own...

03:05.335 --> 03:07.019
Students, stop talking.

03:07.246 --> 03:09.021
Does everyone have
their worksheets?

03:09.172 --> 03:10.747
You'll need to visit
these five locations

03:10.766 --> 03:13.007
within the prison and write
a description of them.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.768
Wolf, did you look over
the worksheet?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.086
Oh, absolutely.

03:16.104 --> 03:18.346
Practically got it memorized,
Teachio.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.681
Please never call me that again.

03:19.775 --> 03:21.200
Now, if you'd follow me
up front,

03:21.427 --> 03:23.518
there is seating for you there,
with the other adults.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.779
Three to a seat
violates safety protocol.

03:25.931 --> 03:26.930
Sorry about that.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.281
(singsongy):
Here I come.

03:28.434 --> 03:29.875
Don't worry, guys.
I'm not gonna be hard on you

03:30.044 --> 03:31.935
about that worksheet
because we can all agree

03:32.104 --> 03:33.937
that homework stinks.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.272
Pee-yew, am I right?

03:35.365 --> 03:38.199
Do we have the option
to take a different bus?

03:38.219 --> 03:40.777
-What's that one?
-Dark-eyed junco.

03:40.870 --> 03:43.555
Slate plumage with a touch
of white around the tail.

03:43.707 --> 03:44.890
Pale-pink bill.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.391
A flock is sometimes called
a blizzard.

03:46.543 --> 03:48.802
But instead of covering
the ground with snow,

03:48.878 --> 03:51.713
they blanket the ground
with the warm thrum of life.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.307
Aah! Oh, sorry. Hello.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.717
No, I'm sorry.

03:55.794 --> 03:57.402
You should never surprise
a fellow bird-watcher.

03:57.554 --> 03:59.629
I have some of the quietest
footsteps in the world.

03:59.631 --> 04:01.147
I entered
an international competition

04:01.242 --> 04:02.741
and came in fifth place.

04:02.968 --> 04:04.058
Hello.
My name is Greta Meatweep.

04:04.227 --> 04:06.970
Well, Greta,
it is great-a to meet you.

04:07.063 --> 04:09.656
I'm Beef Tobin.
This is my Moon son.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.066
(laughs)
I mean my Moon son.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.235
I mean my son--
get it together, Beef.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.645
This is my son Moon.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.482
I couldn't help overhearing
you describing those birds.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.000
It sounded like poetry to me.

04:20.152 --> 04:22.761
I happen to be a proud member of
the Lone Moose Poetry Gaggle.

04:22.912 --> 04:24.838
I also coordinate the snacks.
Are you a poet?

04:24.932 --> 04:28.992
I, um... Am I a poet?

04:29.011 --> 04:30.994
Elizabeth Barrett Browning!

04:31.087 --> 04:33.179
Flying atop a bird
with a poetess?

04:33.274 --> 04:35.440
This is what I daydreamed of
as a teen.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.109
Please tell me you are
a poet, too, Beef,

04:37.260 --> 04:40.520
and then arrange me
like your beautiful words.

04:40.614 --> 04:44.307
♪<i> Greta Meatweep.</i> ♪

04:45.027 --> 04:47.360
Yes, yes, of course I'm a poet.

04:47.513 --> 04:48.620
Uh, Dad?

04:48.847 --> 04:50.680
Remember, Moon? How I am one?

04:50.682 --> 04:52.273
Right, yes.

04:52.367 --> 04:53.683
He sure is a poet.

04:53.702 --> 04:56.628
Oh, boy, can this guy rhyme
with the best of them.

04:56.855 --> 04:58.463
I admire that so much.

04:58.690 --> 05:00.114
I write non-rhyming poetry

05:00.134 --> 05:01.449
because I can never
think of rhymes.

05:01.543 --> 05:03.302
Uh, uh, for instance,
this morning

05:03.453 --> 05:05.119
I was trying to think
of a rhyme for "table."

05:05.197 --> 05:07.955
-Stable.
-Wow, what a gift.

05:08.050 --> 05:09.533
I can smell the horses already.

05:09.551 --> 05:10.976
I know this is short notice,
but would you be interested

05:11.203 --> 05:13.537
in attending a poetry gathering
this afternoon?

05:13.630 --> 05:15.630
Perhaps you could recite
one of your poems.

05:15.724 --> 05:16.815
Oh, and you can bring your son

05:16.966 --> 05:18.542
and any other poetry lovers
out there.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.985
Am I talking too fast?
I hope not.

05:20.136 --> 05:21.320
I had a caffeinated mint
yesterday,

05:21.471 --> 05:22.988
and it's still working its way
through my system.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.048
So, can I count you in or not?

05:25.067 --> 05:26.383
Hmm. Yes?

05:26.401 --> 05:27.734
And read one of your poems?

05:27.886 --> 05:29.069
Certainly.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.887
What a wonderful thing
I have agreed to do.

05:30.906 --> 05:33.648
I'm very happy
with myself about it.

05:33.742 --> 05:34.982
It's going to be at the VFW.

05:35.077 --> 05:36.560
-See you there.
-You bet.

05:36.578 --> 05:39.245
Son, did I just tell
that enchanting lady of letters

05:39.398 --> 05:42.841
that I am a poet and agree
to read one of my poems

05:42.992 --> 05:45.569
-at an event this afternoon?
-Correct.

05:45.662 --> 05:47.087
Wonderful.

05:47.163 --> 05:49.756
Welcome to the Death Cliff
Prison and Museum.

05:49.908 --> 05:53.093
There is to be no spitting,
slapping or chewing gum.

05:53.169 --> 05:54.411
I believe you can
laugh at something

05:54.504 --> 05:55.854
without screaming
performatively.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.005
Just no loudness in general.
Got it? Good.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.007
Okay, we'll be splitting up
into three groups.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.861
One group with me,
one with Chelery's fathers,

06:03.088 --> 06:04.254
and one with
the Tobins' older brother Wolf.

06:04.347 --> 06:07.014
Stay with your group.
Do not stray.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.608
Mind your chaperones
as if they were me

06:08.702 --> 06:11.595
but with far less knowledge
of obscure film noir.

06:11.613 --> 06:12.929
Okay, let's go inside.

06:12.948 --> 06:14.264
All right, Wolf's group,
huddle up.

06:14.357 --> 06:16.766
-You guys have your passes?
-What passes?

06:16.785 --> 06:19.211
Yeah, the permission slip said
we just needed a water,

06:19.362 --> 06:20.528
lunch and a good attitude.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.772
My attitude sucks,
but I brought a sandwich.

06:22.866 --> 06:26.610
Guys, I'm talking about
your back-cage passes. (laughs)

06:26.628 --> 06:29.036
We're about to go on a special
little "off the books" tour

06:29.172 --> 06:31.723
called "Wolf's
Private Prison Peep Show."

06:31.875 --> 06:33.225
Eh... wait,
that did not sound right.

06:33.334 --> 06:36.711
So, let's call it "Wolf's
All-Inclusive Prison Peep Show."

06:36.730 --> 06:38.121
Man, still not right.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.398
Wolf, what are you
talking about?

06:39.625 --> 06:42.142
I'm talking about
an all-access tour

06:42.294 --> 06:44.310
of the very secret locations
within this prison

06:44.405 --> 06:46.888
that Cheesecake and I discovered
when we were in high school.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.465
Oh, I love going
behind the scenes.

06:48.558 --> 06:50.967
One time I saw the employee
break room at the art museum.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.894
Whew, if those mugs could talk.

06:52.988 --> 06:55.080
Okay, that's the door we need
to sneak through right there.

06:55.231 --> 06:56.915
Beyond that is
a whole wing of the prison

06:57.066 --> 06:58.733
that's not open to the public

06:58.827 --> 07:01.645
that ends in a very fun
surprise destination.

07:01.663 --> 07:03.070
Cheesecake was looking
for a bathroom,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.981
but I'm telling you,
what we found was

07:05.000 --> 07:06.258
so much better than a bathroom.

07:06.409 --> 07:08.818
Better than a bathroom?
This I got to see.

07:08.820 --> 07:12.172
Okay, quietly, on your tiptoes.
Go. Go, go, go, go.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.100
We don't have to do the whole
tour on tiptoes, do we?

07:15.251 --> 07:17.727
My calves are still tender
from jazz dance club.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.774
Welcome to
the "Shawshank Tour-demption,"

07:22.776 --> 07:26.260
where it's time to get busy
touring or get busy dying.

07:26.262 --> 07:29.430
Mr. Wolf, I'm having
such an amazing time.

07:29.508 --> 07:31.450
Please, Mr. Wolf is my father.

07:31.601 --> 07:33.359
-Just call me Wolf.
-I can't believe

07:33.512 --> 07:36.288
they don't put this cold, dark
corridor on the regular tour.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.439
Well, this area is
technically closed off

07:38.533 --> 07:40.125
because they say
it's a little dangerous,

07:40.276 --> 07:41.609
but Cheesecake and
I did just fine.

07:41.703 --> 07:43.186
If we find the prison morgue,

07:43.188 --> 07:45.279
I need someone to take
my picture in the body drawer

07:45.299 --> 07:47.299
and text it to my brother,
so that he'll feel guilty

07:47.450 --> 07:49.192
about taking the last
Toaster Strudel this morning.

07:49.211 --> 07:51.911
Beedly-beedly-boop.
Listen up to your tour guide.

07:52.063 --> 07:53.805
Coming up on our left is
the prison wood shop

07:54.032 --> 07:57.033
where you can still see half of
an adorable napkin holder

07:57.126 --> 07:58.477
built by Sammy the Smotherer.

07:58.628 --> 08:01.037
So far I haven't learned
a single useful thing

08:01.130 --> 08:03.130
on this field trip,
and I love it.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.725
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Oh, hey, Beef. I was just</i>
<i> finishing a frozen waffle.</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:07.711
You want one? Oh, no.

08:07.729 --> 08:09.212
What's going on with your face?

08:09.231 --> 08:11.564
Moon and I met a lady
in the forest.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.550
This sounds like
the start of a fairy tale.

08:13.568 --> 08:15.309
Is Moon a frog now?
Is he in your pocket?

08:15.387 --> 08:18.646
Moon is at school, but I told
this woman that I was a poet.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.056
And I promised to attend

08:20.075 --> 08:21.833
a poetry gathering
this afternoon

08:21.985 --> 08:23.668
and read a poem I wrote.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.671
-You really write poetry?
-Well, I've dabbled.

08:26.823 --> 08:28.006
I mean, we're in Alaska.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.416
How can one not be inspired
by the landscape?

08:30.569 --> 08:32.511
Sometimes I write down
a fragment.

08:32.738 --> 08:35.071
And I've always thought
female poets are--

08:35.164 --> 08:37.832
sorry to be graphic--
very attractive.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.577
Emily Dickinson is
my ideal woman.

08:40.595 --> 08:41.928
She loved to be alone

08:42.080 --> 08:43.688
and would have had
no interest in me.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.248
Hubba-hubba.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.359
But then I would never
actually call myself a poet.

08:47.435 --> 08:49.102
It just came out.
I got flustered,

08:49.254 --> 08:50.529
and, well,
now I've really done it.

08:50.756 --> 08:53.180
Okay, don't panic, Beef.
It could be a nice time.

08:53.275 --> 08:55.275
No, Honeybee,
you don't understand.

08:55.351 --> 08:56.868
I'm bad at public speaking.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.519
I've never written a whole poem.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.263
My getting up there
and reading one this evening

09:00.282 --> 09:02.599
will be like a snake trying
to catch a baseball.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.876
Hmm, well, I'm not gonna be any
help to you in writing a poem,

09:05.103 --> 09:07.361
but what I can help you with
is a look.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.215
I was friends with a poet,
Armando, in Fresno,

09:10.442 --> 09:12.275
so I know a thing or two
about how they look and act.

09:12.294 --> 09:15.128
Maybe a scarf could be
an interesting touch.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.964
There are some pretty nice ones
in the scarf hamper

09:18.116 --> 09:19.799
from Wolf's
close-up magic phase.

09:19.951 --> 09:21.618
That's the spirit, Beef.
I have a feeling

09:21.620 --> 09:23.544
once you look in the mirror
and see a poet,

09:23.564 --> 09:25.397
those words will just
come tumbling out.

09:25.548 --> 09:26.639
Thanks, Honeybee.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.792
Maybe I will have a waffle
after all.

09:28.885 --> 09:31.127
Good, I'd feel waffle
if you didn't.

09:31.146 --> 09:32.812
My God, what is this family
doing to me?

09:32.964 --> 09:35.907
All right, hope you all enjoyed
seeing the common area.

09:36.134 --> 09:38.301
Some of the prison's
most notorious killers

09:38.361 --> 09:39.578
did square dancing in there.

09:39.805 --> 09:41.304
We're almost to our destination.

09:41.323 --> 09:43.397
It's just up a... huh.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.417
Wondering if we took
a wrong turn.

09:45.644 --> 09:46.993
Uh, Wolf? Are we lost?

09:47.145 --> 09:48.978
I get lost all the time
delivering pizzas,

09:48.997 --> 09:50.480
so I keep two calzones
in the car,

09:50.498 --> 09:52.315
in case I need to stick
my feet in them for warmth.

09:52.408 --> 09:54.167
Did you bring any hot food
for our feet?

09:54.261 --> 09:57.095
Guys, I'm not gonna
officially label us lost.

09:57.246 --> 10:00.581
More like "momentarily
on unrecognizable terrain."

10:00.675 --> 10:02.934
Wolf, I also agree
that labels put us in a box

10:03.086 --> 10:04.510
with the inability to grow,

10:04.587 --> 10:06.179
but we might want
to find our way back

10:06.331 --> 10:08.181
to the rest of the tour
before all the prison ghosts

10:08.333 --> 10:09.182
come out for the evening.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.133
Yeah, m-maybe you're right.

10:11.186 --> 10:13.778
Hmm... Let me just
take a look around.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.505
Maybe down this way.

10:15.598 --> 10:18.024
-(gasps)
-There's only one track
to get back on,

10:18.118 --> 10:20.118
and it leads straight
from this prison

10:20.269 --> 10:22.269
to the bank where you take on
a second mortgage.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.531
Your underwear always feels wet,
front and back.

10:25.684 --> 10:26.850
Then your arms fall off.

10:26.943 --> 10:28.701
You start yelling at the sink,

10:28.854 --> 10:31.129
and then you die... die... die.

10:31.356 --> 10:33.632
(gasps) You know what?
On second thought,

10:33.859 --> 10:34.874
let's just go a little further

10:34.951 --> 10:36.301
and see if I can get
my bearings.

10:36.528 --> 10:37.785
If you're scared, Judy,
you can hold my hand.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.212
No, thanks, Gill.

10:39.364 --> 10:41.865
But you can hold your own hand
and pretend it's mine.

10:41.883 --> 10:43.883
Really? Thank you.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.644
Our hands fit
perfectly together.

10:45.871 --> 10:48.480
Good news, everyone,
this is starting to look...

10:48.707 --> 10:50.874
-(all scream)
-Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

10:50.892 --> 10:54.878
You guys know I love to swivel
in a chair in complete darkness.

10:54.971 --> 10:56.971
It's one of
my main personality traits.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.824
I told you this tour would be
filled with chills and thrills.

10:59.976 --> 11:01.551
(chuckles):
But everything's fine.

11:01.644 --> 11:03.903
-Okay, let's keep... (screams)
-(others gasp)

11:03.997 --> 11:07.073
Mountain Dew Code Crap!
Not my beautiful brother!

11:07.225 --> 11:09.742
Ham! Say something!
Are you alive?!

11:09.895 --> 11:11.744
-Ha, I'm okay, guys.
-Oh, thank God.

11:11.897 --> 11:13.320
For a minute
I thought you were gone,

11:13.340 --> 11:14.731
and we have so many plans
together, like how we were gonna

11:14.733 --> 11:15.915
wear each other's jeans
and not tell anyone.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.842
You sure you're all right, bud?

11:17.994 --> 11:19.177
Oh, yeah. Yup, yup.

11:19.328 --> 11:21.346
I-I just got surprised
when there was a floor

11:21.497 --> 11:22.847
and then suddenly
there wasn't a floor.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.574
Wolf, this has been super fun,

11:24.576 --> 11:26.184
but we might want
to turn around now?

11:26.335 --> 11:27.593
Yup, just the regular old tour

11:27.746 --> 11:29.579
of regular old Death Cliff
Prison might be nice.

11:29.672 --> 11:31.356
<i> -OLD WOLF: Yoo-hoo!</i>
-Hmm?
-You know, just walking

11:31.507 --> 11:34.100
-and looking and checking stuff
off our worksheets.
-Oh.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.177
Um, uh, yeah. I-I know
what you're saying, Judy,

11:36.196 --> 11:37.696
but now that we're
at the barbershop,

11:37.847 --> 11:39.013
I've got my bearings back.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.532
I remember Cheesecake sat
in that chair

11:40.683 --> 11:42.183
and asked for The Rachel.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.277
The place I'm taking you to is
right around the next corner.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.538
Let me just show you guys
this one amazing thing,

11:46.707 --> 11:47.706
and then we'll go back.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.190
Okay. I guess.

11:49.284 --> 11:50.375
All right! Here we go.

11:50.526 --> 11:52.285
Everybody follow me.
Aah! O-Okay.

11:52.454 --> 11:54.028
E-Everyone watch the hole there.

11:54.122 --> 11:56.773
Now here we go. (laughs, sighs)

11:56.791 --> 11:58.775
Okay, okay.
This looks familiar.

11:58.793 --> 12:01.110
I think this is it.
(laughs) Guys!

12:01.129 --> 12:04.781
-Come here, come here!
-I found it!
-Wow.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.224
Welcome to
the most gorgeous cell

12:06.375 --> 12:07.875
in all of Alaska's
prison system,

12:07.894 --> 12:09.919
the solitary confinement cell

12:10.046 --> 12:12.379
they called
the "underwater coffin."

12:12.399 --> 12:13.806
JUDY:
Look at that view!

12:13.942 --> 12:15.567
This is more like solitary
just-fine-ment.

12:15.718 --> 12:16.960
(chuckles) Okay.

12:17.053 --> 12:18.570
(scoffs) This is
so much better than my room

12:18.721 --> 12:19.887
that it makes me sick.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.297
I feel like I'm
on<i> Big Little Lies.</i>

12:21.316 --> 12:23.074
Told you it'd be worth it.

12:26.154 --> 12:27.728
All right, everybody get out
your lunches.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.581
We'll have a little bite to eat
and then circle back

12:29.583 --> 12:31.975
with the squares
and fill out those worksheets.

12:31.977 --> 12:35.569
Let those chaper-oldies up there
bore their groups to turds.

12:35.663 --> 12:37.088
"Up there, it's their time.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.315
Down here, it's our time."
<i> Goonies.</i>

12:39.334 --> 12:41.408
What on earth
are you talking about?

12:41.503 --> 12:43.669
Oh, hey, Moon.
Glad you could get a ride home.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.097
Your dad's just about to make
his big entrance as a poet.

12:46.249 --> 12:47.766
Come on in, Beef!

12:47.917 --> 12:50.435
MOON:
Oh, yeah. That's a poet.

12:50.586 --> 12:51.677
Yup, it's almost there.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.438
Could I give you
a few adjustments?

12:53.589 --> 12:55.014
-Please.
-Okay. Come in again,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.609
but this time stop in the middle
and chuckle knowingly.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.335
Yeah. Then look off
into the distance

12:59.428 --> 13:01.780
as you contemplate
the sound of a leaf falling.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.430
And you should have
a slight cough

13:03.599 --> 13:06.100
-from writing outside
in the elements by the river.
-Got it.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.435
Oh, how about a limp
from a duel you were in

13:08.530 --> 13:10.121
with your lover Calista's
husband?

13:10.348 --> 13:11.956
And would it kill you
to be exhausted

13:12.183 --> 13:13.699
by the beauty
that's all around you?

13:13.794 --> 13:17.537
Okay. Chuckle. Cough.
Limp. Exhaustion. Got it.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.464
(chuckles)

13:19.615 --> 13:20.873
(coughs)

13:20.967 --> 13:23.693
Oh, look at that beauty.

13:23.711 --> 13:25.119
Boy, I'm tired.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.363
That is good.
Oh, one last thing.

13:27.382 --> 13:28.714
Let's mess up your beard.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.216
Poets are always
a little shabby.

13:30.368 --> 13:31.476
My friend Armando was
constantly mistaken

13:31.627 --> 13:33.369
for a scarecrow
when we were picnicking.

13:33.371 --> 13:34.887
All right, that ought to do it.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.056
Should we get in the car
and set this poetry in motion?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.208
Seriously, what is this family
doing to me?

13:39.227 --> 13:42.211
One more thing--
I have to write an actual poem.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.714
Oh, yeah...
I forgot about that part.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.232
You got 20 minutes.
Go, go, go.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.494
All right. Now I just have
to come up with a poem.

13:49.645 --> 13:53.389
Let's see. Maybe one of these
fragments could inspire me.

13:53.482 --> 13:56.225
Hmm. Well, this one is covered
in barbecue sauce.

13:56.394 --> 13:57.669
Gonna throw that out.

13:57.896 --> 14:00.988
And, uh, this one just says,
"Good morning, rake."

14:01.007 --> 14:03.508
Oh, man,
this is gonna be terrible.

14:03.659 --> 14:07.420
And now, a man who promised me
in the woods that he was a poet.

14:07.496 --> 14:09.330
A man who I might be
able to love,

14:09.349 --> 14:12.592
but absolutely everything
is riding on this moment.

14:12.744 --> 14:14.168
If this poem isn't good,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.670
then my nascent feelings for him
will dry up

14:16.764 --> 14:18.247
and blow away like ash.

14:18.249 --> 14:21.267
Fingers crossed.
Here he is, Beef Tobin.

14:21.361 --> 14:25.029
Poem. Poem. Barf. Barf. Poem.

14:25.181 --> 14:26.513
That's not a poem.

14:26.608 --> 14:29.350
(echoing):
Liar!

14:29.369 --> 14:30.201
(shudders)

14:30.353 --> 14:32.353
What rhymes with "God help me"?

14:32.447 --> 14:34.764
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm sure going to miss

14:34.857 --> 14:37.283
this solitary confinement cell
in an abandoned prison.

14:37.435 --> 14:40.603
Hey, um, why did they call it
the underwater coffin anyway?

14:40.696 --> 14:41.954
Oh, it's not always so nice.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.456
Uh, we were here
at a good time of day.

14:43.608 --> 14:45.532
They would literally
send people in here to die.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.293
See the holes they drilled
in the wall there?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.869
It floods during high tide.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.296
But what a way to go, huh?

14:50.448 --> 14:53.282
So, we're in a cell
that floods with icy cold water?

14:53.301 --> 14:54.467
Yeah, but we're fine now.

14:54.619 --> 14:56.302
The tide's just starting
to come in.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.229
Okay, everybody. Pack
your snacks. We're headed back.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.957
Huh. How did this get closed?

15:01.050 --> 15:02.141
GILL:
Oh, I closed that.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.626
My mom's been getting
on me about

15:03.645 --> 15:05.069
my door-closing bathroom
etiquette lately.

15:05.221 --> 15:07.721
She's gonna be so proud
when I tell her.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.889
Uh... guys.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.408
WOLF:
Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

15:10.635 --> 15:14.153
Wolf, should you maybe use your
cell phone to call Mr. Golovkin?

15:14.247 --> 15:15.729
Oh, right, yep. (stammers)

15:15.823 --> 15:18.249
Okay, there's no signal.
Uh, a-anybody else getting one?

15:18.401 --> 15:21.644
-OTHERS: No.
-Okay, nobody panic.
I'm gonna get us out of here.

15:21.663 --> 15:24.363
Oh, great. How?!

15:24.424 --> 15:25.982
Okay, let's see, locked cell

15:26.000 --> 15:27.741
in an abandoned wing
of the prison,

15:27.761 --> 15:29.152
far from anyone else,

15:29.245 --> 15:30.762
slowly filling up
with cold ocean water.

15:30.913 --> 15:32.746
Just, uh...
give me one more minute.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.266
(sighs) Well, if I'm going
to die in an abandoned prison,

15:35.493 --> 15:36.826
I'm glad it's with you, Ham.

15:36.844 --> 15:38.752
This guy with the romance.

15:38.846 --> 15:41.164
How lucky am I?

15:41.182 --> 15:42.165
(Beef coughing)

15:42.167 --> 15:44.943
-Beef? Are you okay?
-Ah, yes.

15:45.170 --> 15:47.520
My cough comes
from writing in the river,

15:47.672 --> 15:50.597
and the limp from dueling
with your lover.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.677
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I just heard a leaf fall.

15:54.696 --> 15:56.012
Oh, wonderful.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.956
I can't hear leaves.
I have leaf deafness.

15:58.183 --> 15:59.958
What I would give
to hear a leaf again.

16:00.109 --> 16:02.034
There are certain sounds
I can't hear

16:02.187 --> 16:03.352
because I was struck
by lightning.

16:03.446 --> 16:05.855
Leaf sounds, dubstep,
certain truck engines,

16:05.873 --> 16:07.131
and ironically, thunder.

16:07.283 --> 16:09.133
Well, I better go put the snacks
on the table.

16:09.285 --> 16:11.861
I love making the Cheez-Its
into a little fan shape.

16:11.879 --> 16:13.471
Can't wait to hear
that poem, Beef.

16:13.622 --> 16:14.764
Oh, God.

16:18.127 --> 16:18.959
Ham, boost me up!

16:19.053 --> 16:21.220
(grunts) Anyone with a belt?

16:21.372 --> 16:23.389
-I need it now, please.
-What's it worth to you?

16:23.541 --> 16:26.375
John, I like and respect you
just the way you are,

16:26.469 --> 16:28.711
but we don't have time
for drama right now.

16:28.730 --> 16:29.970
Fine, but you have to admit,

16:29.990 --> 16:32.215
what we just did was
a little dramatic.

16:32.308 --> 16:33.899
Okay, yes! The belt.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.052
Wolf, are you gonna use these
to climb out?

16:36.145 --> 16:38.020
-Uh-huh.
-No, it's too dangerous!

16:38.022 --> 16:40.072
Judy, I got us into this
acting like a kid.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.742
I need to get us out of it
acting like an adult.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.168
I was being a ding-dang fool

16:44.395 --> 16:46.153
because a guy
in a fire extinguisher cabinet

16:46.205 --> 16:48.339
had me worrying
about second mortgages.

16:48.491 --> 16:49.732
-What?
-Never mind.

16:49.901 --> 16:52.159
If I can lower myself
to the rock below the window

16:52.178 --> 16:54.679
with these belts,
I should be able to scale

16:54.830 --> 16:56.072
the rest of the cliff.

16:56.165 --> 16:58.099
Just like a little billy goat
right to the top.

17:00.002 --> 17:01.744
Uh-uh. You get out of here.

17:01.837 --> 17:03.596
But your arms,
they'll fall off

17:03.748 --> 17:05.005
if you act like an adult.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.100
Shut up, Old Wolf!
You have no power over me!

17:08.253 --> 17:09.752
I'm really worried
about your brother.

17:09.771 --> 17:12.030
I don't think he should get
that second mortgage.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.927
-Don't leave! We need help!
-We're not leaving.

17:17.945 --> 17:19.111
We're having our lunch break.

17:19.264 --> 17:21.238
Wait, where's your group?
Why are you wet?

17:21.391 --> 17:22.689
I screwed up big-time.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.283
I just wanted them to think
I was still young enough

17:24.377 --> 17:26.210
to hang out with them
and do something crazy,

17:26.362 --> 17:27.937
but then I did
something actually crazy

17:27.955 --> 17:29.047
and very, very stupid.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.440
-Where are they?
-Okay, this is gonna sound bad,

17:31.534 --> 17:34.460
but they're in a cell
called the underwater coffin.

17:34.537 --> 17:37.446
-It's actually really beautiful.
-Stop talking. Let's move.

17:37.465 --> 17:40.224
And if you should see
a baby stork

17:40.376 --> 17:42.376
Flying through
the midnight sky

17:42.395 --> 17:44.228
Is he delivering himself?

17:44.380 --> 17:46.380
Do I hear his forlorn cry?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.048
Who delivers the baby storks?

17:48.142 --> 17:51.069
With their parents
busy delivering us

17:51.220 --> 17:53.404
Young birds, forsaken

17:53.631 --> 17:55.481
Who can they trust?

17:55.633 --> 17:57.633
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Santiago.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.577
Another poem about storks,

17:59.728 --> 18:01.987
and just as enjoyable
as all the others.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.489
Now, I'm very pleased
to introduce

18:03.641 --> 18:05.658
a poet I found in the woods
this morning.

18:05.810 --> 18:06.992
His name is Beef Tobin,

18:07.087 --> 18:08.477
and he's going to read
an original poem.

18:08.496 --> 18:11.255
Hello, everyone.
This is my poem.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.333
It is called
"Good Morning, Rake."

18:14.469 --> 18:15.501
(clears throat)

18:15.653 --> 18:18.504
There I was,
walking by the lake...

18:18.598 --> 18:21.173
Um, I'm sorry, let me...
let me start again.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.417
Or rather, start over.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.845
I, uh... Oh, boy.

18:25.997 --> 18:28.998
Greta, this morning,
um, with the birds,

18:29.016 --> 18:31.776
I was stirred
by your smiling face,

18:31.927 --> 18:34.353
and my vision blurred.

18:34.505 --> 18:38.174
And-and, yes, I mistakenly
blurted out a half-truth,

18:38.343 --> 18:41.510
making me a fool,
and here is the proof.

18:41.529 --> 18:44.455
I am not a poet--
I'm sorry, it's true--

18:44.607 --> 18:47.533
but my lie bloomed
from my feelings,

18:47.685 --> 18:49.685
my feelings for you.

18:49.687 --> 18:51.354
(applause)

18:51.356 --> 18:54.615
Dad, I think you should have
coughed a little more,

18:54.634 --> 18:56.283
but overall it was pretty good.

18:56.377 --> 18:58.210
I'm sorry again, Teachio.

18:58.363 --> 18:59.695
Wolf, we talked about "Teachio."

18:59.788 --> 19:01.213
And apology accepted,

19:01.366 --> 19:03.290
but I'm going to save you
a lot of heartache

19:03.384 --> 19:04.809
and give you a piece of advice.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.127
Being the fun adult never works.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.054
It's impossible to ride
that line successfully

19:09.207 --> 19:11.207
without ending up
looking like a fool

19:11.300 --> 19:13.225
and maybe getting arrested
for a stunt at a skate park.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.710
Just ask my stepbrother Glarn.

19:14.803 --> 19:16.821
I could have followed
in his footsteps very easily

19:17.048 --> 19:18.305
when I first started teaching

19:18.399 --> 19:21.159
if I'd given in to my ridiculous
desire to be liked.

19:21.386 --> 19:23.810
Kids crave boundaries
from adults, not friendship.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.330
They can still like you
even if you're not their friend.

19:26.482 --> 19:29.149
You're right. I'm sorry
I dropped the chaperone ball.

19:29.243 --> 19:30.743
I guess I can't have
my childhood cake

19:30.837 --> 19:32.003
and eat it, too.

19:32.154 --> 19:33.412
They still have adult cake,
Wolf.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.988
And the great thing
about adult cake is

19:35.008 --> 19:36.823
it can be anything you want.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.009
It can even be a model train set

19:38.236 --> 19:39.919
you've put thousands
of hours and dollars into

19:40.013 --> 19:42.162
but still feel
weirdly ashamed of.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.997
You're a grown-up,
you shouldn't have it,

19:44.017 --> 19:45.908
but you love to see
those choo choos go round.

19:45.927 --> 19:47.076
Thanks, Mr. Golovkin.

19:47.245 --> 19:49.261
You can call me Theodore.
We're both adults.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.355
Do all adults call
each other Theodore?

19:51.507 --> 19:52.673
I-Is that a thing?

19:52.692 --> 19:55.342
-N-No, Wolf. That's my name.
-Oh, copy that.

19:55.436 --> 19:58.921
Greta, sorry I lied to you
about being a poet.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.589
Well, I hate to say this

20:00.591 --> 20:02.425
because I hate
when other people say it,

20:02.443 --> 20:04.869
but I think you are a poet,
and you may just not know it.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.705
Well, perhaps we could
have coffee sometime

20:07.932 --> 20:09.356
and just chat about poetry.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.101
I think reading off a menu
is more the level

20:12.119 --> 20:13.878
of public speaking I'm used to.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.529
Coffee with you would be great.

20:15.623 --> 20:17.030
We could even call it a...

20:17.050 --> 20:18.549
-Mmm, date?
-Yes.

20:18.776 --> 20:19.717
That's exactly the word.

20:19.868 --> 20:21.277
How do you do that?

20:21.429 --> 20:24.964
I'm sorry I almost got you and
all your friends killed today.

20:25.116 --> 20:27.283
My bad. I didn't want to be
an Adult Arnold,

20:27.301 --> 20:30.377
and I almost accidentally became
a Murdering Michael.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.972
I guess being responsible
doesn't have to be a bad thing.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.048
But I promise,
I'm still gonna watch

20:35.142 --> 20:37.401
<i> Dakota: A Cowboy at College</i>
with you,

20:37.628 --> 20:39.478
and I'll never let
my arms fall off.

20:39.630 --> 20:40.980
Well, I'm glad to hear that,
Wolf,

20:41.074 --> 20:43.557
because you'll need them
for hugging.

20:43.651 --> 20:44.891
(chuckles):
Get in here!

20:44.986 --> 20:46.727
GOLOVKIN:
Safety protocol!

20:46.804 --> 20:47.970
From one adult to another,

20:48.063 --> 20:49.413
