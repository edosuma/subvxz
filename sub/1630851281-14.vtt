WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:07.050
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i> Excuse me?

00:07.094 --> 00:08.443
Your mother did what?

00:08.486 --> 00:10.836
She pre-paid for me
to have my eggs frozen

00:10.880 --> 00:12.229
at a fertility clinic.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.665
Uh, I-I'm gonna make
an appointment

00:13.709 --> 00:14.753
for a consultation.

00:14.797 --> 00:15.972
Call my skip tracer.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.061
Randy: <i>
Skip Tracer Randy!</i>

00:18.105 --> 00:19.889
<i>That's me.</i> Hey, Randy.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.456
<i>Skip Tracer Randy here.</i>

00:21.499 --> 00:24.937
My skip tracer looked into
Penelope, Donovan's fiancée.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.200
She used to be an escort.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.115
Use Penelope's history
to get him to back off.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.117
I had no idea
you would stoop this low.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.857
I did what I thought
was best.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.295
Penelope and I broke up,
and Lila is devastated.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.297
My license just got suspended
for six months.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.863
So what are you
gonna do?

00:37.907 --> 00:39.648
Well, right now, I'm debating
which bar to get drunk at.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.608
<i>♪ Itsy bitsy spider went up</i> <i>
the waterspout ♪</i>

00:43.652 --> 00:45.871
I figured we could put
some knickknacks up here.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.395
Maybe have
a digital picture frame

00:47.438 --> 00:48.787
for a slide show
of Jack.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.789
Between fixing
the garage door

00:50.833 --> 00:52.443
and all the new
kitchen cabinets,

00:52.487 --> 00:54.271
you've really turned
into a Mr. Fix-it.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.752
I had no idea
how handy I was.

00:56.795 --> 00:57.970
Right.
Yeah.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.276
Oh, even though I worked up
a sweat,

00:59.320 --> 01:01.017
I'm still gonna go
to the gym.
That's my man.

01:03.237 --> 01:06.327
Love you.
Love you, too.

01:06.370 --> 01:10.679
<i>♪ Down came the rain and washed</i> <i>
the spider out ♪</i>

01:21.994 --> 01:23.909
So, Wesley decided to do
some do-it-yourself

01:23.953 --> 01:25.346
around the house again?

01:25.389 --> 01:26.477
He'll be at the gym
for an hour.

01:26.521 --> 01:27.217
Can you come now?

01:27.261 --> 01:28.914
I'm on my way.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.135
Tell Angela I said hi.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.484
Thank you.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.487

Ugh.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.412
You okay?

01:49.370 --> 01:50.675
Yeah.

01:50.719 --> 01:54.070
I just hate
these kinds of forms.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.204
"Mid-Wilshire Fertility Clinic
Patient Intake Form"?

01:57.247 --> 01:58.335
Sounds riveting.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.642
You have no idea.

02:00.685 --> 02:01.817
They basically
want to know

02:01.860 --> 02:03.645
whether anyone in my family,
going back to

02:03.688 --> 02:06.169
my great-great-great-great-
grandparents,

02:06.213 --> 02:09.477
ever had halitosis
or webbed feet.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.609
It's a little intense.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.872
It helps them screen
for genetic disorders.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.874
Ensures that they harvest
your very best eggs.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.572
Mm-hmm. I guess.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.704
But since I don't know
my biological father, you know,

02:19.748 --> 02:21.228
it makes it kind of challenging.

02:21.271 --> 02:24.970
Wait.
Your dad's not your bio dad?

02:25.014 --> 02:27.234
- Mnh-mnh.
- You never told me that.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.800
It's not really
a big deal.

02:28.844 --> 02:32.717
My dad, the man who raised me,
is my dad.

02:32.761 --> 02:36.417
Yeah, but weren't you ever
curious?

02:36.460 --> 02:38.723
Honestly, not really.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.030
I did ask my mom once,
when I was in college,

02:41.073 --> 02:43.902
because I felt like I was
supposed to want to know.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.775
She told me that he was not
ready to be a father,

02:46.818 --> 02:50.039
and, you know,
left it at that.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.084
Maybe it's time to ask again,

02:52.128 --> 02:54.826
if only to find out whether
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria

02:54.870 --> 02:57.220
or methemoglobinemia
runs in the family.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.528
I'm taking repro-bio.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.138
But those two
are totally rare.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.880
You're much more likely
to pass on a predisposition

03:04.923 --> 03:06.273
for heart disease
or cancer.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.885
Mm-hmm.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.148
I'm always happy
to lend Angela a hand,

03:12.192 --> 03:13.671
but this is the fifth time
I've been over there this month.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.630
Oh, sounds like Wesley needs
a new hobby.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.588
Wesley needs to get
his law license back.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.547
This guy
is frantically waving.

03:19.590 --> 03:20.548
Do you know him?

03:20.591 --> 03:22.376
Uh, yes,
and you do, too.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.029
That is Randy.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.248
Skip Tracer Randy?

03:25.292 --> 03:26.945
Hi,
it's Skip Tracer Randy.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.600
Oh, wow.
Nyla Harper, you look radiant.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.602
John Nolan, so nice
to finally meet

03:31.646 --> 03:33.430
that handsome face
that hangs on my wall.

03:33.474 --> 03:34.997
Thank you. What?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.607
Oh, yes, I background-check
all of my friends.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.175
John Nolan, 46,
born Foxburg, Pennsylvania,

03:39.219 --> 03:40.307
to Evelyn and Charles.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.091
Abandoned by his papa,
age 10.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.746
Ex-wife Sarah, son Henry,
half-brother Peter --

03:44.789 --> 03:46.269
oh, quite a character,
that one.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.140
The background I ran on him
was so long,

03:48.184 --> 03:50.142
my printer ran entirely
out of ink.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.797
That's -- Wow,
that is super thorough

03:52.841 --> 03:54.103
and a little bit creepy.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.627
Yeah. So, um,
what are you doing here, Randy?

03:56.671 --> 03:59.326
Oh, ja.
So, uh, big news.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.805
I'm a bounty hunter now.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.851
Yes, and I need
your help.

04:02.894 --> 04:05.375
Do you know the sexy-time lady,
Ivy Flynn?

04:05.419 --> 04:06.637
The Hollywood Madam?

04:06.681 --> 04:08.509
Yes.
She's jumped over her bail,

04:08.552 --> 04:09.858
and I must now find her.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.947
Could I <i>bitte, bitte</i>

04:11.990 --> 04:14.993
just get a <i>kleiner blick</i>
at her arrest report?

04:16.778 --> 04:18.258
Alright, go get him
a redacted copy.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.217
Oh. You're the bees
of the knees!

04:21.261 --> 04:22.392
Your bees --
Your knees --

04:22.436 --> 04:24.133
Your bees contain knees.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.527
Listen, do you really know
what you are doing?

04:26.570 --> 04:28.529
Bounty hunting
is dangerous.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.706
I know, and I've been preparing
like an animal.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.795
I've recently learned how to
fire a bow and arrow

04:33.838 --> 04:35.144
using just my feet.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.277
Okay, I am not sure how
that is gonna help you

04:37.320 --> 04:39.104
out on the street,
but, um,

04:39.148 --> 04:41.063
please just promise
you'll call me

04:41.106 --> 04:42.499
if you get into
any trouble.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.458
Oh, yes, of course.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.024
Here you go.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.330
My first bounty.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.376
Oh, this is so exciting!

04:49.419 --> 04:52.944
Oh, man!
Bye-bye, my dearest friends.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.250
Yeah.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.079
- - Weird guy.
- Mm-hmm.
- You have no idea.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.473
I don't know what to do.
This handyman phase

04:59.516 --> 05:01.039
is driving me nuts.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.911
So, it just sounds like

05:02.954 --> 05:05.522
he's looking for ways
to feel useful

05:05.566 --> 05:06.915
during the suspension.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.396
What he's doing
is the opposite of useful.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.614
Do you know what?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.094
I got a call yesterday
from a producer

05:12.137 --> 05:13.487
at "Hot Suspect."

05:13.530 --> 05:15.489
He was asking me
if I can recommend someone

05:15.532 --> 05:17.795
who can join the show
as a legal consultant

05:17.839 --> 05:19.406
for a new character.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.321
I can call him and see if
he's still looking for someone.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.409
Oh, my God, yes.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.106
Okay. Okay.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.847
So, I'll call him after
the sergeants' meeting.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.027
Or I can call him now?

05:34.203 --> 05:38.425
It says here the bounty
for Ivy Flynn is $250K.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.644
For a madam?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.951
There are violent offenders
with much lower bails.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.823
Yeah. And nonviolent offenders
rotting in jail

05:45.867 --> 05:48.478
because they can't afford
the 100 bucks it would cost

05:48.522 --> 05:50.175
to bail out
before their trials.

05:50.219 --> 05:53.135
I mean, we imprison them
for being poor.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.354
Yeah.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.007
Well, clearly,
the high bail set for Ivy

05:56.051 --> 05:57.792
is meant to squeeze her
so she flips on her clients.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.577
But with a bounty
that high,

06:00.621 --> 06:03.101
that means there will be
serious people looking for her

06:03.145 --> 06:04.233
on both sides of the law.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.540
There's no way Randy
is ready for that.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.758
Who you calling?

06:07.802 --> 06:09.238
A friend in Vice.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.935
I got to figure out what
the deal is with this case

06:10.979 --> 06:13.373
before Randy
gets himself killed.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.994
Hey, do you think
it's weird

06:26.037 --> 06:27.996
I didn't try to find
my biological dad?

06:28.039 --> 06:30.085
No. You don't owe the guy anything.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.347
The only thing he ever
contributed to your life

06:31.391 --> 06:33.262
was measured
in milliliters.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.046
That is gross.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.700
Seriously, I don't know
why I bother talking to you

06:36.744 --> 06:37.832
about personal stuff.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.311
Mission accomplished.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.791
Hey, what happened?

06:40.835 --> 06:43.881
Someone used a Molotov cocktail
to torch this guy's car.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.230
Lucy:
Any idea who did it?

06:45.274 --> 06:47.755
No. But after talking to him
for 30 seconds,

06:47.798 --> 06:49.147
I'm pretty sure
your suspect pool

06:49.191 --> 06:51.323
is anyone with
two X chromosomes.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.979
Hey, sir,
I'm Sgt. Bradford.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.503
Do you know who torched
your car?

06:56.546 --> 06:58.635
Yeah, some psycho chick
in a red track suit.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.115
I saw her
from my apartment window.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.465
She was gone by the time
I got down here.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.902
Do you know why a woman would
want to destroy your car?

07:04.946 --> 07:06.861
No.
The ladies love me.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.384
Although a few
of my last lovers

07:08.428 --> 07:10.995
might have left
a little ungrateful.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.997
Okay, uh, why don't you
give us a list?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.521
How about giving me
your number?

07:18.960 --> 07:21.005
Why you want to know
about Ivy Flynn?

07:21.049 --> 07:24.966
Uh, a bounty hunter I know
asked about her.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.924
She's a cut above
the usual idiots we chase.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.318
Hell, she has a master's
in education.

07:29.361 --> 07:31.363
Took two years to build a case
against her.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.017
She's not gonna be
easy to find.

07:33.061 --> 07:36.325
How did she go from studying to
be a teacher to a madam?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.240
She started doing sex work
to pay for grad school.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.677
Found a niche with high-end
clients who wanted smart,

07:40.721 --> 07:43.332
sophisticated girls to show off
at parties, premieres,

07:43.375 --> 07:45.160
that kind of thing.

07:45.203 --> 07:47.118
Off of that,
she started her own business.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.599
Before her arrest,
she ran the top game in town --

07:49.643 --> 07:52.123
movie stars, politicians, judges.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.648
If her clients really are
that powerful,

07:54.691 --> 07:56.084
she's probably scared
of what they'll do to her

07:56.127 --> 07:57.215
if she talks.

07:57.259 --> 07:58.565
There's something else
you should know.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.089
When she transitioned
from sex worker to madam,

08:01.132 --> 08:03.570
she needed seed money
to start her business.

08:03.613 --> 08:07.835
Rumor is, some of that financing
came from organized crime.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.619
Hmm.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.797
It's Randy.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.233
Hey, can I call you back
in a few?

08:15.277 --> 08:16.887
Randy: Ivy Flynn. <i>
I found her.</i>

08:16.931 --> 08:19.934
<i>1717 Piedmont.</i> <i>
But I'm in trouble.</i>

08:33.556 --> 08:34.949
Nolan:
Police!

08:38.039 --> 08:41.521
Oh, help.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.438
Control, 7-Adam-15.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.353
Send an RA unit
to my location.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.791
Male, 50s,
gunshot to the shoulder.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.096
Conscious
and breathing.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.576
Is the person who shot you
still in this house?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.709
No.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.580
Alright, tell me
what happened.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.540
This woman, uh,
I don't know her.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.542
She broke in and demanded money
from me,

09:02.585 --> 09:05.022
and when I said no,
she shot me! Ugh!

09:05.066 --> 09:07.111
Randy:
He's lying!

09:07.155 --> 09:08.199
Randy?

09:08.243 --> 09:10.027
Yeah, in here.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.247
Randy, w-what are you doing
in there?

09:12.290 --> 09:14.031
It's locked.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.077
I got scared a little bit,
and then I hid a little bit.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.600
In a coffin?

09:17.644 --> 09:19.341
Don't be silly.
It's not a coffin.

09:19.384 --> 09:21.430
It's the man's sex box.

09:21.473 --> 09:24.302
Uh, that's not true.

09:24.346 --> 09:27.044
Oh, yes, it is. Do not let
this nation of puritans

09:27.088 --> 09:28.872
kink-shame you, man.
Be proud!

09:28.916 --> 09:30.657
Randy, what --
what happened?

09:30.700 --> 09:34.051
Okay, so, I tracked Ivy here,
but she wasn't alone.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.314
They were arguing, so I hid
in here to listen,

09:36.358 --> 09:37.881
but I got stuck.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.840
Did you hear what they were
arguing about?

09:39.883 --> 09:43.017
Oh, ja. It was all about
those Benjamins.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.715
The man was supposed to give her
cash monies for silence,

09:45.759 --> 09:47.848
but he pulled a gun
and tried to shoot her.

09:47.891 --> 09:48.892
I did not.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.590
Oh, yes, you did.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.070
I have it all
recorded on my phone.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.507
Hey
I'm starting to feel

09:55.551 --> 09:56.900
a little tingly inside.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.815
That sounds like
oxygen deprivation.

09:58.859 --> 09:59.816
Where's the key?

09:59.860 --> 10:00.861
I don't have it.

10:00.904 --> 10:01.949
What?

10:01.992 --> 10:03.385
My dominatrix does.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.300
It's a control thing.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.824
Randy: Johnny,
are you still nearby?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.609
Yeah, Randy, I'm here.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.481
I forget, am I supposed to
step into the light

10:12.524 --> 10:13.961
or stay away?

10:14.004 --> 10:15.832
Okay, we need to
get him out of there.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.705
Control, I got a --
a weird one.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.711
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.103
I didn't really
have a choice.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.105
I was kinda sorta threatened
into this by my wife.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.804
How romantic. Anyway, Sabrina --
that's my new actress --

10:30.847 --> 10:32.762
she really wants to bring
this character to life.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.896
She wants to know how lawyers
eat, sleep, breathe.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.246
If I'm being honest, she's
actually a little exhausting.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.856
Hey, there she is!

10:39.900 --> 10:41.379
Sabrina,
this is Wesley Evers,

10:41.423 --> 10:42.598
the defense attorney
I told you about.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.904
He comes
highly recommended.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.688
Nice to meet you, Sabrina.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.211
Where do you stand
on Dameron vs. Mitchell?

10:48.473 --> 10:51.694
I'm sorry?2009, Judge Fordham,
Ninth Circuit?

10:51.738 --> 10:54.958
Uh, I'm not familiar
with that case.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.395
Not familiar?
And you're a defense attorney?

10:57.439 --> 10:59.093
Yeah.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.790
This is your expert, Alan?
Come on.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.096
No, no, wait, there --
there actually

11:02.139 --> 11:03.750
is no Judge Fordham
in the Ninth Circuit.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.188
Well, there is
in the script.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.624
Did you make him up?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.844
Yes,
for our television show.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.020
Oh, sorry, my bad.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.195
That means
I have a lot of questions

11:14.238 --> 11:15.892
about that courtroom scene
in Act Four.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.851
And Wesley is here
to answer them for you.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.287
You two have fun.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.724
Wesley, I cannot thank you enough.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.944
Mm-hmm.

11:23.987 --> 11:27.338
So
where do you want to start?

11:27.382 --> 11:30.515
Everywhere.

11:30.559 --> 11:31.386
Show me your world.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.822
Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:32.866 --> 11:33.997
Your whole world. Yeah.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.607
Truman:
That box cost me 20 grand.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.305
It was custom-made for me.

11:37.348 --> 11:38.349
You better not ruin it.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.792
Oh. <i>Danke schoen.</i>

11:45.835 --> 11:48.011
Oh. Whew!

11:48.055 --> 11:49.883
I have to say, aside from
the complete lack of oxygen,

11:49.926 --> 11:52.363
this is
surprisingly comfortable.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.713
Alright.
Look into the light.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.062
Okay.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.064
And...

11:57.107 --> 11:58.195
He's fine.

11:58.239 --> 12:00.545
No, girl,
you're the one who's fine.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.547
- Excuse me?
- It's an inside joke.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.462
Oh. Uh, why do you have
an inside joke

12:04.506 --> 12:05.812
with Skip Tracer Randy?

12:05.855 --> 12:08.031
Uh, Skip Tracer Bounty Hunter
- Randy.
- Right.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.730
After we had him look into
Jason, we kept in touch.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.253
Yeah, we're, like,
total besties now.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.170
Besties.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.258
Alright, I have to
get back to work.

12:17.301 --> 12:18.259
Okay.
Stay safe.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.260
You, too.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.130
Bye.
Bye.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.610
Ugh.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.394
You know, if you would have
just called us

12:23.438 --> 12:24.744
when you got here,
we could have helped you

12:24.787 --> 12:26.223
bring Ivy in safely.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.486
Ja, ja, I know, but I wanted to
prove to you guys

12:28.530 --> 12:30.271
I'm a real bounty hunter.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.795
Also, I know they say,
"More money, more problems,"

12:32.839 --> 12:34.014
but
I didn't want to share

12:34.057 --> 12:35.406
the money with you.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.887
Uh, you do know that if
we helped you bring in Ivy,

12:37.931 --> 12:38.888
you could keep
all the money?

12:38.932 --> 12:40.368
Police don't keep bounties.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.804
No way.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.111
Uh, hey, guys,
we should totally do something

12:44.154 --> 12:45.547
called "being partners."

12:45.590 --> 12:47.201
Forget it, no.
This is a police matter.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.464
Ivy has already shown that
she is ready to use

12:49.507 --> 12:51.596
deadly force,
so you need to stand down

12:51.640 --> 12:52.946
and let us handle this.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.556
I understand, Nyla,
you're trying to protect me.

12:54.599 --> 12:57.428
You're like a Valkyrie
sparing me from Valhalla.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.562
Oh, well, I guess
I'll just have to read

13:00.605 --> 13:01.824
her secret messages
on my own... Whoa.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.130
...to find out where
she will go.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.348
Wait, wait, wait.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.176
What --
What secret messages?

13:06.220 --> 13:08.352
No one has been able to crack
her communications --

13:08.396 --> 13:11.007
not the FBI, not the LAPD,
no one.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.793
Ja, that's correct.
None of them employ Randy.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.883
But I will only share these
with a partner.

13:18.580 --> 13:21.452
Fine, Randy.
We can work together.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.324
- Yes.
- Temporarily.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.065
Now, how did you hack
her e-mails?

13:25.108 --> 13:26.718
Oh, that's the genius
of her madness.

13:26.762 --> 13:27.981
She doesn't use
e-mail or text.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.722
She uses
"Popcorn Pillager."

13:30.766 --> 13:31.941
Oh, fun.
It's a --

13:31.985 --> 13:33.725
Yeah, it's a --
it's a video game.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.815
Once you hit Level 30, you can
message other players.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.295
<i>Exakt.</i> This way,
she ensures her clients

13:38.339 --> 13:40.515
complete confidentiality.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.778
Okay, so, what was
her last message?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.258
Oh.
Does it say
where she was going?

13:44.301 --> 13:45.389
Uh, let's check.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.043
Yeah, okay.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.177
Boot loot-de-doot,
bippity-bop, and...

13:50.220 --> 13:53.789
So, she is meeting with
a forger to buy a passport.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.842
Thank God you're here.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.540
We just suffered
a biological attack.

14:05.583 --> 14:10.588
A-A fur bomb. Uh, a horrible,
disgusting act of violence.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.155
Okay, what happened?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.156
Rats.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.897
Okay, ma'am,
you can't call 911

14:14.941 --> 14:16.029
when a rodent gets into
your restaurant.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.857
No, they didn't
just wander in.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.642
They were released
by a crazy woman.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.687
She came in with
an animal carrier, and --

14:22.731 --> 14:23.775
and before I knew what was happening,

14:23.819 --> 14:25.865
she set free a dozen rats

14:25.908 --> 14:27.997
in the middle
of my breakfast rush.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.912
I mean, it was chaos.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.916
I want her arrested for
biological terrorism.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.962
OK,
can you describe her?

14:36.005 --> 14:40.314
Um, she had a ball cap on,
a-a red track suit.

14:40.357 --> 14:41.619
That's like
our arson suspect.

14:41.663 --> 14:42.664
Her name
is Jordan Conner.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.274
She used to work here.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.407
And I fired her because
she was late all the time.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.061
Okay, do you have an --

14:48.104 --> 14:49.801
Oh.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.369
Sorry.
Do you have her address?

14:54.284 --> 14:56.939
This is a step up from
the usual MacArthur Park

14:56.983 --> 14:58.462
fake I.D. crew.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.377
Well, it's not like Ivy's
throwing a kegger.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.989
I mean, she's trying to
get past the TSA.

15:03.032 --> 15:06.557
Passports are almost impossible
to fake.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.911
I'm bored.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.477
Yeah, well,
hunting fugitives

15:13.521 --> 15:14.826
is all about
the waiting game.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.306
If you can't hack
a little boredom,

15:16.350 --> 15:17.873
then maybe you should go back
to skip tracing.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.661
That's her.

15:31.539 --> 15:34.672
Hey! Police! Stop!

15:34.716 --> 15:36.109
Hands up!
Show me your hands!

15:42.811 --> 15:46.075
I'm working! Alicia Kaufman,
Kaufman Bail Bonds.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.121
Alicia? Get out.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.297
What a crazy <i>zufall</i>
seeing you here!

15:50.340 --> 15:51.472
You two know each other?

15:51.515 --> 15:53.778
Oh, ja.
She's the one who got away.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.867
A former lover,
not an escaped prisoner.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.695
Although don't think we didn't
role-play that.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.176
And now we
are rival bounty hunters.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.228
Her story checks out.
She was just after the bounty.

16:08.271 --> 16:11.274
250,000 bucks gone,
thanks to you.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.668
A fugitive still on the loose,
thanks to you.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.670
How did you know where Ivy was
gonna be, anyway?

16:15.713 --> 16:16.976
I hacked his phone.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.499
I've been listening to
everything you said.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.762
OMG, you hacked me?

16:20.805 --> 16:22.590
Your password is skiptracerrandy1.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.026
Yes.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.462
You might want to think about
changing that.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.203
You're a licensed bondswoman.

16:27.247 --> 16:30.032
You know that you can't
interfere in police business.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.600
She is super sorry
and will never do it again.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.036
No, I'm not,
and yes, I will.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.038
You're such a kidder.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.779
Hey, we should team up,
you know, become partners,

16:37.822 --> 16:39.694
now that I'm a bounty hunter, too.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.783
Oh, I thought you were
teamed up with us.

16:41.826 --> 16:43.872
Is that why you're out here,
ruining my bounty?

16:43.915 --> 16:46.048
You want to
get back together?

16:46.092 --> 16:47.919
If I win this cash money,
I will take you

16:47.963 --> 16:49.312
on the most romantic vacation ever,

16:49.356 --> 16:51.184
to the most romantic city
ever --

16:51.227 --> 16:52.794
Munich.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.057
Or how about I win the money,
and I use it to pay someone

16:55.101 --> 16:58.060
to sear all memory of
our relationship from my brain

16:58.104 --> 16:59.888
with a hot poker?

16:59.931 --> 17:03.413
Oh, God, I have missed the way
you tease me.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.632
I got a bounty to collect.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.025
Am I free to go?

17:06.068 --> 17:08.070
Yeah, but stay out
of our way.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.074
We need to know where Ivy
is going next,

17:12.118 --> 17:14.120
and she's got to know
that we hacked into

17:14.163 --> 17:16.687
her "Popcorn Party"
or whatever,

17:16.731 --> 17:18.254
so she's not gonna
use that.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.475
Well, until recently, she
employed dozens of escorts.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.085
Maybe one of them
has a lead.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.087
They are very loyal
and hard to find.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.437
Ivy protected her girls
as much as her clients.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.439
But I do know of one girl
who fell out with Ivy

17:29.483 --> 17:30.919
many years ago.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.226
But she also hates Harper
very much,

17:33.269 --> 17:36.881
with all the passion
of her soul, in a bad way.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.405
What are you talking
about?

17:38.448 --> 17:41.321
Penelope, uh, the lover
of your former husband.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.062
The woman whose heart
you crushed under your feet

17:43.105 --> 17:45.020
like a tiny cockroachy.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.891
She's never gonna want
to talk to me.

17:46.935 --> 17:50.156
And yet we need to
talk to her.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.334
So, normally, an attorney
would have to be escorted

17:54.377 --> 17:55.770
by an officer
through the station,

17:55.813 --> 17:58.686
but I have some pull here.
Hey, uh, Sgt. Grey.

17:58.729 --> 18:01.993
This is Sabrina Fowler,
the very talented new actress

18:02.037 --> 18:04.213
on "Hot Suspect."

18:04.257 --> 18:06.781
Wade Grey.
My wife loves your show.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.436
Oh.
It's a pleasure.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.614
You know, my character,
Margo Caine,

18:13.657 --> 18:16.138
is having an affair
with a police sergeant.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.532
And his wife
likes to watch.

18:18.575 --> 18:22.188
Would your wife
like to watch?

18:22.231 --> 18:24.320
Um, n-no.

18:25.930 --> 18:29.499
Um, Detective Lopez,
come, come, come, come.

18:29.543 --> 18:34.765
Please show your husband
and his friend around.

18:34.809 --> 18:37.028
- Please.
- Hi. You must be Sabrina.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.161
Call me Margo.
I'm a method actor.

18:39.205 --> 18:42.947
It's a very important part
of my process.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.645
I don't just play a role.

18:44.688 --> 18:45.733
I inhabit it.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.779
Oh, okay... Margo.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.259
Thank you.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.174
Can I talk to you
- for a sec?
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.175
Mm-hmm.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.832
What was that?

18:57.875 --> 19:00.530
I don't know.
It's been a very strange day.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.184
She keeps going in and out
of character.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.577
I'm never quite sure
who I'm talking to.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.187
On the ride over here,

19:05.231 --> 19:07.668
she says that Margo uses
her sexuality as a weapon.

19:07.711 --> 19:08.843
I mean,
who talks like that?

19:08.886 --> 19:10.236
Someone trying
to steal my man.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.628
Unh-unh.

19:11.672 --> 19:14.240
No, Margo only has eyes
for Grey.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.545
Trust me.

19:15.589 --> 19:19.027
Hey.
Where's Looney Tunes?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.204
Uh...

19:23.945 --> 19:26.165
This is why a guest
needs an escort.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.601
How are you gonna lose
an actress?

19:27.644 --> 19:29.037
Look, in my defense,
Angela didn't notice, either,

19:29.080 --> 19:30.865
and she's a detective.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.519
Wait. Shut up.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.434
Sabrina: ...intruding upon the
sanctity of his private thoughts

19:34.477 --> 19:36.523
is ergo unconstitutional...

19:36.566 --> 19:38.525
Oh, please, no.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.483
Okay, fine, I'll drop
the charges.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.093
No, you will not.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.486
She's not a lawyer.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.488
Really? Well,
she's the toughest mouthpiece

19:45.532 --> 19:46.489
I've ever met.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.969
Thank you.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.840
Four years at USC's
School of Dramatic Arts.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.233
That's great.
It's, uh, time to go.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.974
Oh, I'll tell you. Oh.

19:53.017 --> 19:53.975
Does that mean
I get to go, too?

19:54.018 --> 19:55.194
No.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.630
Lopez, take him back
to the holding cell

19:56.673 --> 19:58.197
until a real lawyer
shows up.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.895
Smitty, my office, now.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.116
Lucy:
This is Jordan's building.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.686
Tim:
Sir, are you okay?

20:09.730 --> 20:10.687
Does it look like
I'm okay?

20:10.731 --> 20:11.688
What happened?

20:11.732 --> 20:12.689
Who's asking?

20:12.733 --> 20:14.082
We're police officers.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.475
One of my tenants showed up
at my door

20:15.518 --> 20:16.606
and pepper-sprayed me.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.607
Okay, which tenant?

20:17.651 --> 20:18.869
Girl in Apartment B.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.349
Uh, Jordan Conner.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.872
And why do you think
she did that?

20:21.916 --> 20:24.310
How should I know?
It's always drama with her.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.920
She's three months behind
on her rent.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.096
Always complaining
about special circumstances.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.532
She's a pain
in my ass.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.317
Did you see where she went
after she attacked you?

20:31.360 --> 20:32.666
Obviously not.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.932
Uh, sir, if she,
uh, comes back,

20:37.975 --> 20:39.107
feel free
to give us a call.

20:39.150 --> 20:39.977
Yeah, if she knows
what's good for her,

20:40.021 --> 20:41.327
she won't be back.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.806
Do you need us to call anyone
for you?

20:42.850 --> 20:44.112
No, I'm good.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.289
She's escalating.
First, property damage,

20:47.333 --> 20:48.421
now assault.
We got to find her

20:48.464 --> 20:49.596
before she really hurts someone.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.727
I'll get a warrant
to track her phone.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.296
I just wanted to ask you
a few more questions

20:54.340 --> 20:56.690
about Ivy Flynn.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.346
Oh, no, no, you've got to be
kidding me.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.348
You actually think I'm gonna
tell her anything?

21:02.391 --> 21:03.914
Penelope, I-I...

21:03.958 --> 21:05.916
Randy: <i>Ja, Bailey,</i> <i>
I'm telling you, girl --</i>

21:05.960 --> 21:08.223
<i>Alicia and I really had</i> <i>
a breakthrough.</i>

21:08.267 --> 21:10.225
<i>You should have seen her face</i> <i>
when I mentioned Munich.</i>

21:10.269 --> 21:12.009
R-Randy, uh,
the mic is on.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.228
<i>Oh, hold on, Bailey.</i>

21:13.272 --> 21:14.534
<i>I need to turn</i> <i>
the microphone off.</i>

21:14.577 --> 21:16.318
<i>Okay, now, where were we?</i>

21:16.362 --> 21:17.972
Randy, still on.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.365
The one with the red li--
You know what?

21:19.408 --> 21:20.366
I'm just gonna --
I'm gonna go get him.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.324
Mm-hmm, yeah.
I'm gonna --

21:22.368 --> 21:24.108
Hey, how about
we go for a walk?

21:24.152 --> 21:25.371
<i>Oh, that sounds fun.</i>

21:34.336 --> 21:39.298
Uh, listen, um,
I owe you an apology.

21:39.341 --> 21:42.083
Oh, 'cause you used
my history as a sex worker

21:42.126 --> 21:46.000
to ruin my relationship?
Yeah, you do.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.785
Okay, um, you may not
believe this,

21:48.829 --> 21:51.701
but it was never my intention
to involve you.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.616
It was about my daughter.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.358
I just -- I couldn't let him
take her.

21:56.402 --> 21:59.535
And, honestly, I-I think
sex work should be legal.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.408
Wow.
How progressive of you.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.801
I know I outed you,
but it was Donovan

22:04.845 --> 22:06.063
who couldn't get past it.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.633
I mean, isn't it better
that you know that

22:10.677 --> 22:11.895
before you married him?

22:14.202 --> 22:16.204
I really loved him.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.206
He is very lovable.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.166
And he's the most uptight man
I have ever dated.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.864
So uptight.

22:25.169 --> 22:28.259
But it should have been
my choice to tell him.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.740
I know.

22:30.784 --> 22:34.614
And I truly am sorry
for using your past

22:34.657 --> 22:37.268
in my fight with Donovan.

22:37.312 --> 22:40.620
It was -- It was unfair.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.275
Thanks.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.932
So you want intel
on Ivy?

22:48.976 --> 22:51.370
Anything you know
might help.

22:51.413 --> 22:55.722
Okay, well, if she's hiding out,
she's doing it in style.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.680
I'd check Hotel Mathilde.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.161
She used to keep
a permanent suite on hold there

23:00.204 --> 23:01.249
for her top clients.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.600
Thank you.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.314
You've had quite the day, Jordan.

23:23.358 --> 23:26.317
We spoke to your ex,
your old boss, your landlord.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.667
Greatest hits.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.800
Or maybe "hit list"
is more appropriate.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.411
It's a pretty epic
revenge tour.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.586
You want to
talk about it?

23:33.629 --> 23:35.370
Not much to say.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.372
People suck.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.983
Yeah. Amen to that.

23:40.027 --> 23:43.247
Still, you must have
had a reason.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.293
You know what BRCA1 is?

23:45.336 --> 23:46.947
The breast cancer gene.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.688
My mom had it.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.472
She died when I was 7.

23:50.516 --> 23:54.868
So, last year,
when I found a lump,

23:54.911 --> 23:57.436
I wasn't surprised.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.829
And I was resigned.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.875
I knew I was gonna die.

24:01.918 --> 24:05.444
I was sure of it.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.446
Until last week,

24:07.489 --> 24:11.275
when my doctor told me
I was in remission.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.451
Congratulations.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.496
Yeah.

24:14.540 --> 24:17.499
So, then I was like,
"Screw resignation."

24:17.543 --> 24:19.893
I'm still here.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.503
And as long as I am,
I'm done apologizing

24:21.547 --> 24:23.157
for my existence.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.159
Okay, so that's why
you lit your ex's car on fire?

24:25.202 --> 24:28.641
When I told him I was sick,

24:28.684 --> 24:31.295
his first response was,
"I don't do bald chicks."

24:32.862 --> 24:36.387
And then my boss fired me
for being late from chemo.

24:38.346 --> 24:42.872
When I was too sick to work,
my landlord raised my rent.

24:42.916 --> 24:46.876
I'm sorry
that happened to you.

24:46.920 --> 24:51.446
I thought that if I was
a good person who worked hard

24:51.490 --> 24:53.840
and was nice to people,

24:53.883 --> 24:56.973
good things would come back
to me.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.932
And all I got
was this pile of crap.

25:00.977 --> 25:05.112
So, today, I decided
we make our own karma.

25:07.114 --> 25:10.987
If that means you need to
arrest me...

25:11.031 --> 25:12.380
I still say
it's worth it.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.442
Hmm.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.227
You know, most people have
a near-death experience

25:33.270 --> 25:36.143
and want to change their life
for the better.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.362
Got to respect her
for going the other way.

25:38.406 --> 25:39.929
I guess.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.149
All I can think about
is her spending her whole life

25:42.192 --> 25:44.891
waiting to get sick
like her mom.

25:44.934 --> 25:48.764
Is it better to know
or not?

25:48.808 --> 25:51.245
You talking about
bio dad now?

25:51.288 --> 25:53.464
Yeah. I mean,
everything she said back there,

25:53.508 --> 25:55.554
it's in my head.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.688
Well, call your mom.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.560
Have the hard conversation.

26:01.603 --> 26:02.822
Find out the truth.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.869
If I want to find out the truth,
I'm not gonna call my mom.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.175
I'm gonna call Aunt Amy.

26:11.439 --> 26:12.875
Thank you so much
for meeting me here.

26:12.919 --> 26:15.486
Are you kidding?
I'm glad you called.

26:15.530 --> 26:16.966
Okay, so...

26:17.010 --> 26:19.142
I have to ask you
some questions,

26:19.186 --> 26:21.797
but I don't want you to talk
to my parents about it.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.582
Okay.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.497
So, you know how my mom paid
to have my eggs frozen?

26:26.541 --> 26:28.935
I told her not to do that,
by the way.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.850
But God forbid
she listen to her sister.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.286
Yeah.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.505
I was really pissed about it
for a few days,

26:34.549 --> 26:37.639
but, you know, ultimately,
I decided to explore it,

26:37.683 --> 26:40.816
which led to a bunch of
medical forms

26:40.860 --> 26:43.776
that are filled with questions
I -- I can't answer.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.473
About your birth father.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.909
Yeah.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.433
Your mom would kill me.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.653
Uh, please?

26:51.697 --> 26:52.828
I promise
I won't tell her.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.352
I just need to know
what's in my DNA.

26:55.396 --> 26:58.181
It's not as simple
as giving you a name.

26:58.225 --> 27:00.183
The year your mother
became a therapist,

27:00.227 --> 27:01.707
she...

27:01.750 --> 27:03.926
slept with a patient.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.886
He was your father.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.801
What?

27:08.844 --> 27:10.933
She swore me to secrecy.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.762
It would ruin her career
if it ever got out.

27:15.285 --> 27:17.113
I think the shame
still eats her up.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.992
I just want you
to look around.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.428
And there are so many
neighborhoods like this

27:27.471 --> 27:29.299
that are underresourced, overpoliced,

27:29.343 --> 27:30.997
where people are going to prison
because they'd rather

27:31.040 --> 27:33.347
take a plea deal
than risk going to trial

27:33.390 --> 27:34.740
in our broken
justice system.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.612
Wait.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.614
Say those exact words again.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.442
What you said was so real.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.662
I'll have Alan do a rewrite
to incorporate it.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.577
Okay, it -- it's my job.

27:46.621 --> 27:49.450
No, it's my mission
as a defense attorney

27:49.493 --> 27:51.974
to try to get the best defense
possible for my clients,

27:52.018 --> 27:53.541
no matter who they are,
where they're from,

27:53.584 --> 27:55.891
what they may have done,
whether it's, uh,

27:55.935 --> 27:57.937
an innocent man at the wrong
place at the wrong time,

27:57.980 --> 28:01.636
or a drug dealer
pushed into the life

28:01.680 --> 28:04.247
for lack
of other opportunities.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.685
That's a drug dealer?

28:06.728 --> 28:07.773
Like, a real drug dealer?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.426
Yeah.
Maybe not so loud.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.913
You son of a bitch!

28:17.957 --> 28:19.698
I know it was you!

28:19.741 --> 28:21.351
Whoa. It might have been,

28:21.395 --> 28:23.353
but you're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.964
Don't play coy with me.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.531
Does the name Hamster Reed
ring a bell?

28:27.575 --> 28:30.578
Hamster?
Is she for real?

28:30.621 --> 28:31.535
No, no,
sorry about that.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.755
Because you killed him.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.626
You and that poison
you sling.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.065
You need to walk away.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.153
Why?

28:40.196 --> 28:41.937
Is the truth too hard
to stomach?

28:41.981 --> 28:44.331
Hamster may have been a junkie,
but he was my friend.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.724
Sabrina, stop.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.464
You better get this crazy-eyed
Barbie out of my face.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.336
Yeah. No, absolutely.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.859
No problem.
This is just a big

28:50.903 --> 28:52.426
misunderstanding.
She's an actor.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.819
This is her insane way of
getting into character, so...

28:55.777 --> 28:56.865
Oh!

28:56.909 --> 28:59.389
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

28:59.433 --> 29:01.696
"Murder Dance Party,"
right, huh?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.263
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.
You -- You --

29:03.306 --> 29:06.788
You were the sexy cheerleader
who got stabbed in the spleen

29:06.832 --> 29:09.573
in the tango scene?
Am I right?

29:09.617 --> 29:10.749
- Yes!
- Uh-huh.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.752
Oh, you --
No, no, no, you were amazing!

29:13.795 --> 29:16.319
You know, I kinda teared up
when you died.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.105
You are so kind.

29:19.148 --> 29:20.149
And, yeah, I was, like,
the best thing

29:20.193 --> 29:21.542
that happened
in that movie.

29:21.585 --> 29:23.587
Oh! Yo, is it cool if I get
a picture with you?

29:23.631 --> 29:25.764
Yeah!
Oh.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.591
This is my good side, so... Okay, okay, yeah.

29:27.635 --> 29:28.897
Me?
Yeah.

29:28.941 --> 29:29.811
- Oh, uh, right.
- Fellas, everybody, everybody.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.205
How is this my life?

29:32.248 --> 29:34.033
Okay, everybody,
say "cheese."

29:34.076 --> 29:36.252
Cheese.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.820
One more, just for safety.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.087
You okay?

29:48.874 --> 29:51.833
My whole life,
nothing I have ever done

29:51.877 --> 29:53.182
has been good enough
for my mom -- not --

29:53.226 --> 29:56.925
not my grades,
my boyfriends...

29:56.969 --> 29:59.188
my career.

29:59.232 --> 30:05.281
And this whole time,
she has been a total hypocrite.

30:05.325 --> 30:08.067
Look, uh, maybe, you know,
she's trying to prevent you

30:08.110 --> 30:10.156
from making the same mistakes
she did.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.288
Or she resents me
for reminding her

30:12.332 --> 30:15.596
of the one time in her life
that she messed up.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.250
Lucy, it's --

30:17.293 --> 30:19.643
Oh, uh...

30:19.687 --> 30:21.036
Patrick Walsh.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.259
That's my father's name.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.350
Well, I mean,

30:30.393 --> 30:33.266
at least it's not something
weird, like Dilbert.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.444
You mean
like the cartoon character?

30:37.487 --> 30:39.489
Someone named their kid Hashtag.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.753
You never know.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.581
So, what are you
gonna do?

30:46.453 --> 30:48.585
Find out the truth.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.849
So, does this sudden interest
in bounty hunting,

30:50.892 --> 30:53.286
does it have anything to do
with Alicia?

30:53.329 --> 30:55.462
Ja, of course, dummy.
Try to keep up.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.116
I'm attempting to win
her love.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.509
Okay, I'm just gonna go ahead
and say it.

30:59.553 --> 31:00.771
Why?

31:00.815 --> 31:02.469
She's the perfection
of women,

31:02.512 --> 31:05.037
a celestial beauty
come to walk upon the earth.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.560
Yeah, who hates you.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.084
Ja, a love language as old
as time itself. You agree?

31:09.128 --> 31:10.694
Okay, no, you don't
get to do that.

31:10.738 --> 31:13.262
It is not cute to pursue a woman
who is not interested.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.394
Understand?

31:14.437 --> 31:15.917
Yes, I do.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.745
Thank you for giving me
this insight.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.225
You're welcome.

31:19.268 --> 31:20.748
Ivy's room
is the next one.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.837
Oh, I'll climb
on the next-door balcony

31:22.881 --> 31:24.447
in case she runs
like a rabbit.

31:24.491 --> 31:25.927
No, you will not.

31:25.971 --> 31:26.972
Great idea.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.365
Ivy: Who is it?

31:29.409 --> 31:31.019
Uh, it's Kate
from the front desk.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.412
You have a package.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.457
Oh. Thank you
for bringing it up.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.198
Police.
You're under arrest.

31:36.242 --> 31:37.678
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.593
Oh, wow.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.421
This hotel suite
is heaven.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.729
Come.
Sit down.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.212
So, Miss Sex Lady,

31:50.256 --> 31:51.692
explain one thing to me.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.172
Why did you run?

31:53.215 --> 31:54.738
Why not just take
a sweet deal?

31:54.782 --> 31:56.436
Any deal would involve
prison time.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.699
The second I step foot inside,
I'm dead.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.222
Seems like plenty
of people on the outside

32:00.266 --> 32:01.441
want you dead, too.

32:01.484 --> 32:02.833
Well, at least, out here,
I have a chance.

32:02.877 --> 32:05.445
So, who has the pull to get
you executed in prison?

32:05.488 --> 32:06.794
Nice try.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.536
Hey, you need protection.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.799
Making yourself useful
is the only play you have left,

32:11.842 --> 32:13.366
and you know that.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.412
The Dead Bastards.

32:16.456 --> 32:19.850
Um, sorry, who are these
bastards, and how did they die?

32:19.894 --> 32:22.853
Randy, the Dead Bastards
are a motorcycle gang.

32:22.897 --> 32:25.247
I can take down
half their leadership.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.467
Doesn't matter what I promise,
they'll never let me live.

32:28.859 --> 32:31.558
- Man: Room service.
- Oh, I am starving.

32:31.601 --> 32:32.863
What did you order?

32:32.907 --> 32:34.300
I didn't order anything.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.605
Randy, no!

32:39.870 --> 32:42.003
Nolan: Randy, no!

32:55.582 --> 32:59.194
7-Adam-15.
We need backup and RA, Code 3.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.675
Hotel Mathilde.
Shots fired.

33:01.718 --> 33:03.329
Harper, I need your cuffs.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.248
<i>Ich bin tot?</i> Yes, you're alive.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.379
And very lucky.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.424
And very rich.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.644
- Where's my bounty?
- Go get her.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.733
- I will stay with our gunman.
- Control, 7-Adam-15.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.866
In foot pursuit.
Female suspect, black pants,

33:18.909 --> 33:21.042
multicolored top.
Southbound on third floor.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.827
Oh!

33:24.872 --> 33:26.091
Hey, stop! Wait!

33:26.134 --> 33:27.309
Bye-bye.

33:32.271 --> 33:35.622
Oh, Dead Bastards.
Oh, so colorful.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.754
Tell me, is your club
a fun organization?

33:37.798 --> 33:39.495
Oh, do you have
a clubhouse?

33:39.539 --> 33:41.802
It's not a club.
It's a motorcycle gang.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.456
I have
an electric bicycle.

33:43.499 --> 33:45.588
It's fabulous.

33:45.632 --> 33:48.765
7-Adam-15, A to B.
I have identified our shooter

33:48.809 --> 33:51.029
as a member of
the Dead Bastards.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.118
Copy that.
I do not have eyes on suspect.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.207
She got into the elevator
with Alicia Kaufman.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.905
They're headed down to
the parking garage.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.385
Alicia? <i>Meine liebe.</i>
She's here?

33:59.428 --> 34:01.387
Oh, always so tenacious.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.258
Nolan, there could be
other attackers.

34:03.302 --> 34:04.520
Uh, be on the lookout.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.956
I'll --
I'll call for backup.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.655
Backup is on the way!
Yeah!

34:08.698 --> 34:11.179
Randy, don't...

34:31.025 --> 34:32.113
Ivy: Let me go!

34:32.157 --> 34:33.245
Alicia: Get your legs
inside that car,

34:33.288 --> 34:36.117
or I'll stick my foot
upside your ass!

34:36.161 --> 34:37.988
Alicia!

34:38.032 --> 34:39.425
You both need to come with me
right now.

34:39.468 --> 34:40.948
It isn't safe.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.732
7-Adam-15, I got them in
the parking garage, Level D.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.040
This is my pinch,
my bounty.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.868
Hey, and tell that little
wienerschnitzel Randy

34:47.911 --> 34:49.522
that he never stood
a chance.

34:49.565 --> 34:50.914
Alicia,
you don't understand.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.612
You got Ivy fair and square.
You can keep the bounty.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.135
I don't care.
But someone just tried

34:54.179 --> 34:55.745
to kill her,
and he's got friends.

34:55.789 --> 34:57.225
I can handle it.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.661
This isn't my first
pain-in-the-ass bail jumper.

36:55.038 --> 36:58.172
Okay, good news.
Found another Patrick Walsh.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.262
This guy is very active on
the over-50 dating sites.

37:01.306 --> 37:05.048
Okay, I got to say,
I feel a little awkward

37:05.092 --> 37:08.095
about us stalking my potential
biological father

37:08.138 --> 37:09.183
on social media.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.445
We're just narrowing down
the field.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.012
It's a common name.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.275
By my count, there are six men
that fit the parameters.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.625
My personal favorite is the guy
with the woodworking blog,

37:16.669 --> 37:19.280
because he's artsy and he can
make us a cool table.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.369
I'm glad you're having so much
fun with this.

37:22.588 --> 37:23.980
Oh.

Hello?

37:29.203 --> 37:31.684
Okay.

37:31.727 --> 37:35.905
Yeah. No,
that's all I needed.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.736
Everything okay?

37:40.780 --> 37:44.218
Um, I asked one
of the clerks at work

37:44.262 --> 37:47.352
to run his name with the number
my aunt had.

37:47.395 --> 37:49.267
I'm guessing he's not
the woodworker.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.007
He --

37:51.051 --> 37:54.228
He's dead.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.275
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:57.318 --> 38:00.930
Yeah, I --
I didn't even know him.

38:00.974 --> 38:03.411
I know, but he's still
the reason you're alive.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.764
You know,
if I'm being really honest,

38:08.808 --> 38:11.463
the fertility questionnaire
was a pressing reason

38:11.506 --> 38:13.856
to find him, but...

38:13.900 --> 38:16.424
I always had this, um...

38:16.468 --> 38:20.733
idea of him that lingered
in my mind.

38:20.776 --> 38:23.649

that we'd eventually meet.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.130

38:29.307 --> 38:30.612
Was it genetic?

38:30.656 --> 38:34.747
Um, he was killed in a car crash
five years ago.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.879
That's sad.

38:36.923 --> 38:39.839
He had no family,
no wife, no kids.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.536
♪ I'll never let go
of you and me ♪

38:41.580 --> 38:43.277
He was alone.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.366
♪ Because all that I am

38:45.410 --> 38:47.760
Maybe I should have tried
to find him sooner.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.371
Maybe, but he's the one
who made the decision

38:50.415 --> 38:52.330
that he wasn't ready
to be a parent.

38:52.373 --> 38:55.420
Whatever he did
with his life after,

38:55.463 --> 38:57.117
it's not on you.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.249
Mm-hmm, yeah.

38:59.293 --> 39:02.601
♪ I'll be there to carry you
through ♪

39:02.644 --> 39:04.907
Now you can finish
the questionnaire.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.953
Mm-hmm.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.172
Are you disappointed
that we're not gonna get

39:09.216 --> 39:10.609
an artisan table?

39:10.652 --> 39:11.958
Um, a little,

39:12.001 --> 39:13.786
but I think I might still follow
his blog, so...

39:13.829 --> 39:15.570
Mm-hmm.

39:15.614 --> 39:17.877
Congratulations.
Your first bounty.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.400
Your check is in the mail.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.967
Oh, thank you,
Nyla Harper.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.534
Thank you, John Nolan.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.579
I could have done it without
you, but this was more fun.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.799
I guess we'll see you next time
someone tries to skip bail.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.017
Uh, I don't know.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.758
This was all very stressful.

39:29.802 --> 39:31.891
I did not care for
the bullets.

39:31.934 --> 39:35.111
Maybe I should just
return to Skip Tracer Randy.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.810
Yeah, that --
that might be best.

39:37.853 --> 39:40.856
But on the other hands,
once you've achieved God status,

39:40.900 --> 39:43.772
it's very difficult
to go back.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.687
Well, I'm off.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.123
But I'll see you
in the hospital.

39:47.167 --> 39:49.125
No, no.
No need for that.

39:49.169 --> 39:51.606
Oh, such a kidder.
Bye-bye, new bestie.

39:51.650 --> 39:52.781
Bye, Skip Tracer Randy.

39:52.825 --> 39:53.782
Bye-bye.

39:53.826 --> 39:54.957
Yeah.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.437
- He's good. In small doses.
- Mm-hmm.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.743
Bye.

39:57.786 --> 39:58.874
To the right,
straight through.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.963
Bye.

40:01.007 --> 40:03.488
Okay.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.011
She's insane.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.186
Yes.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.970
She could have gotten you killed.

40:08.014 --> 40:10.669
I know.
That's why I quit.

40:12.105 --> 40:14.716
I also know
that is not my handiwork.

40:14.760 --> 40:18.154
You had Nolan come in and fix it
when I left, didn't you?

40:18.198 --> 40:20.983
And the mirror in the bathroom
and the fence.

40:21.027 --> 40:24.465
Ah, you could've just asked me
to stop.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.119
I know, but you were
so excited,

40:26.162 --> 40:28.730
and I know how tough
it's been since the suspension.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.602
Hmm. I just didn't think
it would be this hard

40:30.645 --> 40:31.733
not being able to work.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.256
Just want a purpose again.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.433
You will.
Only three more months to go.

40:35.476 --> 40:36.825
♪ Is made up of you

40:36.869 --> 40:38.392
Yeah, I know.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.263
You know, walking around
Curtis' neighborhood today

40:40.307 --> 40:43.441
reminded me how much
still needs to be done.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.878
But in the meantime,
promise to find another way

40:45.921 --> 40:47.488
to fill the void
that doesn't involve

40:47.532 --> 40:49.359
putting holes
in the wall.

40:49.403 --> 40:50.796
Acting seems fun.

40:50.839 --> 40:51.797
Don't you dare.

40:55.365 --> 40:56.323
Salud.

40:56.366 --> 40:57.367
Cheers.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.761
Hey, honey.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.242
Hey, babe.
We're in here.

41:02.285 --> 41:03.243
We?

41:03.286 --> 41:04.418
Randy: Oh, yes!

41:04.462 --> 41:06.028
<i>Mein bruder,</i> <i>
mein bester freund!</i>

41:06.072 --> 41:07.073
Welcome home!

41:07.116 --> 41:08.248
You're in my house.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.510
Yes.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.164
Why are you --
Why are you -- Oy!

41:11.207 --> 41:12.557
Why?

41:12.600 --> 41:14.036
Oh, I love
your sense of humor.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.560
Come sit, join us.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.258
Randy texted me
after he left,

41:18.301 --> 41:20.434
wanting to celebrate
their big bounty.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.568
Their? I'm sorry,
why are you with Randy?

41:23.611 --> 41:25.352
Clearly, you hate him.

41:25.395 --> 41:27.397
No, I love him.

41:27.441 --> 41:29.487
- That was all a game.
- Mmm.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.141
Apparently, Randy and Alicia
are into role play.

41:32.185 --> 41:34.187
As rival bounty hunters?

41:34.230 --> 41:36.058
But you nearly died.

41:36.102 --> 41:38.539
The friction is what
makes the spark, John.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.976
You clearly know
nothing of love.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.891
This must be
very hard for you.

41:42.935 --> 41:45.067
We muddle through somehow.

41:49.289 --> 41:52.205
What's muddling?
It sounds very kinky.

41:52.248 --> 41:53.554
Mmm.
I'll show you tonight.

41:53.598 --> 41:55.817
Okay, great.

41:55.861 --> 41:56.992
So glad you're here.
