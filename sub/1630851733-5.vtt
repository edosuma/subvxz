WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:02.836
- [RuPaul] Previously
on Canada's Drag Race.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.905
- [Brooke Lynn] We'll be
playing the Snatch Game.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.273
(all cheer)

00:06.273 --> 00:07.207
- [Kimora] Hey, white RuPaul.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.275
How you doing?

00:08.275 --> 00:09.409
(laughs)

00:09.409 --> 00:11.745
- Performance art is everywhere.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.547
Performance art is--

00:13.547 --> 00:15.382
Comedy is subjective?

00:15.382 --> 00:19.419
- Brad, I would do anything for
the gays.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.754
- Synthia Kiss,

00:20.754 --> 00:23.156
you are the winner of this
week's maxi challenge.

00:23.156 --> 00:26.393
- Eve 6000, shantay you stay.

00:26.393 --> 00:27.394
Suki,

00:27.394 --> 00:28.395
sashay away.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.573
- [Pythia] Suki has gone home,

00:39.573 --> 00:41.008
one of my Montreal sisters.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.042
I am very devastated.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.543
I'm trying to keep it together,

00:43.543 --> 00:45.946
but I have to remember
that this is a competition

00:45.946 --> 00:49.783
and she wouldn't want me to
sulk over her elimination.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.084
- [Eve] "My dolls.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.586
No matter where you come from,

00:52.586 --> 00:53.987
be proud.

00:53.987 --> 00:54.955
Be loud.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.257
Take life by its throat.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.258
Mwah, Suki."

00:59.760 --> 01:01.828
- Love you so much, Suki.

01:04.264 --> 01:05.465
- What a light.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.566
- [Eve] What a human.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.036
It feels like the group
has really lost someone

01:09.036 --> 01:10.404
that pulled us all together

01:10.404 --> 01:12.572
and made us all feel really
good.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.707
I love her so much,

01:13.707 --> 01:17.377
but now I have to wipe this
bitch off.

01:17.377 --> 01:20.080
- Love you so much.
- Love you, Suki.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.683
See on the flipside, baby girl.

01:24.217 --> 01:27.754
- Birds coming through.
- Cluck cluck, bitch.

01:27.754 --> 01:30.791
- Huge congratulations to
Synthia.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.260
(all cheer)

01:33.260 --> 01:34.461
- [Synthia] Thank you, thank
you, guys.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.897
Thank you so much. Oh my God.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.532
I felt like I was in my element,

01:38.532 --> 01:39.599
and no matter what happens

01:39.599 --> 01:41.234
for the rest of the competition,

01:41.234 --> 01:42.436
Snatch Game's mine.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.805
(all cheer)

01:44.805 --> 01:45.772
I'm feeling great.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.541
I just won the Snatch Game.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.942
I'm feeling the pressure,

01:48.942 --> 01:51.378
but that's how you make a
diamond, y'all.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.413
- Bitch, I can't believe I was
in the top.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.248
- Yes, girl.

01:55.248 --> 01:59.086
- [Kimora] Bitch, I ain't safe
no more.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.821
I was hoping for a win,

02:00.821 --> 02:04.558
but I know the talent
that Synthia portrayed,

02:05.492 --> 02:07.160
and it's undeniable.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.029
My runway was better though.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.432
- I was sure I was
going to be lip-syncing,

02:12.432 --> 02:15.002
and when they said Eve's name,

02:15.002 --> 02:16.336
I was just like,

02:17.437 --> 02:19.006
everything dropped.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.341
- Yeah, me too.
(laughs)

02:21.341 --> 02:23.243
Having to lip-sync was really
hard,

02:23.243 --> 02:25.145
but I still gave it my all
regardless,

02:25.145 --> 02:26.980
because there's no way I
was going to get up there

02:26.980 --> 02:28.749
and lip-sync and not do--
- Oh my God, no.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.283
- Not give this competition
what it deserves,

02:30.283 --> 02:32.119
because it's an honor to be
here.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.955
So I feel really validated
that I was able to prove

02:34.955 --> 02:36.390
that I can do that.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.424
- [Kimora] All right, bitches.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.059
Bawk bawk, time to get out!

02:39.059 --> 02:43.730
(dramatic music)
(all cheer)

02:43.730 --> 02:45.465
- [Adriana] I'm still in this
competition,

02:45.465 --> 02:49.302
and this has given me a slap on
the face.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.771
I am

02:50.771 --> 02:52.739
going to give everything,

02:52.739 --> 02:54.641
commit as never before.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.378
Get ready for this Colombian
heat

02:58.378 --> 03:01.014
because it's going to fire up
your TV.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.350
(gibberish)

03:05.952 --> 03:07.387
- [RuPaul] The winner
of Canada's Drag Race

03:07.387 --> 03:09.556
receives a sickening
supply of beauty products

03:09.556 --> 03:11.224

03:11.224 --> 03:13.627

guest judge,

03:23.270 --> 03:24.104
Bif Naked.

03:24.104 --> 03:24.938
♪ May the best drag queen ♪

03:24.938 --> 03:28.175
♪ Best drag queen win ♪

03:33.580 --> 03:35.182
- [Kimora] Baby, it's a
new day in the workroom

03:35.182 --> 03:36.283
and I'm feeling good

03:36.283 --> 03:37.217
because what?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.685
I'm here.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.854
- Oh my God. The group is so
small.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.689
- Top eight, so great.

03:43.523 --> 03:46.927
So Eve, do you feel as
if you should have been

03:46.927 --> 03:48.228
in the bottom last week?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.729
- No, I don't feel that I should
have been

03:49.729 --> 03:50.831
in the bottom last week.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.766
Really still feel like
my performance was safe,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.668
but then I felt validated by the
judges

03:54.668 --> 03:56.336
and it's almost like you're
getting a win,

03:56.336 --> 03:57.170
you know, when you--
- Yeah.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.072
- [Eve] Win a lip-sync.
- Oh yeah.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.241
- It's like a win without the
$5.000.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.210
- [Eve] Yeah.
(all laugh)

04:03.210 --> 04:05.645
(siren)
(all scream)

04:05.645 --> 04:07.848
- [RuPaul] O Canada.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.351
She done already done had
herses.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.352
My queens.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.854
(all cheer)

04:13.854 --> 04:16.790
Canada's next drag
superstar needs to show up

04:16.790 --> 04:18.558
and hoe down.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.961
So whether you're a frilly
hillbilly,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.130
or a honky-tonk woman,

04:23.130 --> 04:27.767
you got to show the world
that you love your country.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.369
Y'all come back now, you hear?

04:29.369 --> 04:31.471
(laughs)

04:33.540 --> 04:35.675
- Hey flops, daddy's home.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.744
(all cheer)

04:37.744 --> 04:38.578
- Meow.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.148
- Gather around, my loves.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.984
I think it's time we had the
talk.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.053
In this week's mini challenge,

04:47.053 --> 04:50.257
I want you to partner up
and get into your finest

04:50.257 --> 04:52.559
sex educator quick drag.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.262
(all laugh)

04:55.262 --> 04:57.531
- [Traci] And give a lesson on
safe,

04:57.531 --> 04:59.332
and oh so pleasurable,

04:59.332 --> 05:00.867
sex.

05:00.867 --> 05:03.003
- Up my alley, let's do this.

05:03.003 --> 05:03.837
- I'm ready.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.940
- Since everyone loves
a hands-on tutorial,

05:06.940 --> 05:10.377
our friends at Trojan have
provided an assortment

05:10.377 --> 05:13.213
of the best sexy time condoms,

05:13.213 --> 05:14.848
plus lubricants

05:14.848 --> 05:16.716
and vibrations

05:16.716 --> 05:20.020
for any sex-tracurricular
activities.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.255
(comedic sex noises)

05:22.255 --> 05:23.790
- I love me some sex,

05:23.790 --> 05:25.525
and some education.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.527
- Have a big gay ol' time with
it,

05:27.527 --> 05:29.629
but make sure we learn
something.

05:29.629 --> 05:30.964
Everyone understand?

05:30.964 --> 05:32.332
- Yes.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.667
- Okay, partner up.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.137
Trojan sex-ed class will
begin in 20 minutes.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.639
Go.
(all scream)

05:39.639 --> 05:42.275
- Make room.
- God, I'm so hairy.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.277
- What a challenge this will be.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.746
- [Synthia] What a challenge?

05:46.746 --> 05:48.448
- Synthia's so funny today.

05:48.448 --> 05:49.349
- I'm always funny.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.051
You're just realizing it.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.452
You just wanted this
narrative in your head

05:52.452 --> 05:54.387
that like I can't be pretty and
funny.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.989
(Eve laughs)

05:55.989 --> 05:57.357
- Well, I didn't say pretty.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.459
(laughs)

06:03.063 --> 06:04.130
- Hey.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.332
- Hi.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.234
Come on in. Wow.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.703
You ready to teach us some sex
education?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.238
- Of course.
- [Traci] Yeah?

06:11.238 --> 06:13.206
So we want you to play to the
camera.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.075
Don't forget to pretend like,

06:15.075 --> 06:17.310
I don't know anything about sex.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.545
Action.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.914
- Welcome to sexual education.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.082
- 101.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.183
- You're ready to start, girl?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.017
- Come on, let's get it.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.652
- Let's show them some of those
tricks.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.554
Okay, well what we got over
here?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.722
One of my favorites.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.757
- No, no.
- Oh you want the Magnum?

06:30.757 --> 06:34.327
- Baby, Trojan Magnums
always do you right.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.528
(chuckles)

06:35.528 --> 06:37.163
- [Traci] What's the key to safe
sex?

06:37.163 --> 06:38.498
- Condoms.
- Condoms.

06:38.498 --> 06:39.466
- Always wear them.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.400
Put them on.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.568
Because babies ain't fun.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.769
Let me tell you.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.704
- [Traci] Pretend we
know nothing about sex.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.840
I've never seen a condom
before in my life.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.674
- (in Canadian accent)
Well, this is what I love

06:47.674 --> 06:49.242
about supply teaching.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.344
You never know what's
going to be on the docket,

06:51.344 --> 06:52.279
so hey,

06:52.279 --> 06:54.014
let's get sexy.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.782
- Can you tell us about safe
sex?

06:55.782 --> 06:56.916
- (in gravelly voice) So
what do we like to say

06:56.916 --> 06:58.485
before we get the safe sex?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.053
We got to get the consent.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.590
- Consent is actually the
most sexy part of sex.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.693
- We're going to talk
about the vagina today.

07:06.693 --> 07:07.627
- [Traci] Ooh.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.262
- [Pythia] Are you sure that's
the vagina?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.997
I wouldn't know, I don't have
one.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.332
- Oh, holy water.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.900
- Show us how to use a condom.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.168
- When I was in school,

07:15.168 --> 07:17.370
they used to tell us
to put it on a banana,

07:17.370 --> 07:19.272
but let me tell you in my
experience,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.608
it's been more like the
eggplant, okay?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.643
- Leave a little bit loose at
the tip.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.511
- Just the tip.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.846
- For the semen at the end of
the show.

07:26.846 --> 07:27.681
(imitates flatulence)

07:27.681 --> 07:28.715
(laughs)

07:28.715 --> 07:31.584
- Very important to have
your own lubricant, baby?

07:31.584 --> 07:33.053
- Especially for us old ladies,

07:33.053 --> 07:36.489
sometimes you can get dry
and dusty and that's okay.

07:36.489 --> 07:37.390
(coughs)

07:37.390 --> 07:39.359
- Let's just say that train's
not going

07:39.359 --> 07:41.294
into the tunnel dry now, guys.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.363
- You need to know your
differences in lube.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.031
Know between your water-based
and--

07:45.031 --> 07:47.534
- Sensitive touch.
- And your silicone-based.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.502
Vaginally, little bit of H2O,

07:49.502 --> 07:51.738
anally, a little bit of
silicone.

07:51.738 --> 07:52.872
- Which one's your favorite?

07:52.872 --> 07:54.274
- Bitch, it's silicone.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.208
(laughs)

07:55.208 --> 07:56.643
All right, we're going to pour
that on.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.445
- Make it all wet.
- Make it rain.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.081
- We've got to make it really
lubed up.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.649
This is really the perfect trick

08:02.649 --> 08:06.319
if you have many people
in your environment.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.455
- What's an orgasm?

08:08.455 --> 08:10.890
- What an orgasm is is the big
finish.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.559
Your body's quaking.
- (moans)

08:12.559 --> 08:14.027
- You're forgetting what day it
is.

08:14.027 --> 08:14.894
- Okay, okay,

08:14.894 --> 08:16.763
something's coming.
- Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.531
- Show them what the orgasm is,
come on.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.166
- Oh. Oh. Oh.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.168
- (grunts)
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.570
- Put a mouth over it like this.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.371
(gasps)

08:24.371 --> 08:25.205
- Where's the tip?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.573
Where's the tip? Find the tip.

08:26.573 --> 08:28.141
Oh- oh my gosh,

08:28.141 --> 08:30.910
that condom feels so good.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.078
The condom is on.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.213
Let's show them how to use it.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.481
- All right, babe.
- Come on.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.982
This is how we use the condom.

08:35.982 --> 08:36.816
Take this,

08:36.816 --> 08:37.751
and you go in.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.585
- Big finish.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.419
- That's it.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.353
Make those noises.
- (screams)

08:40.353 --> 08:42.255
- And that's a wrap.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.190
I think I need a cold shower
after that.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.925
- Henny, don't we all?

08:45.925 --> 08:47.627
- You all did such a great job,

08:47.627 --> 08:50.029
but two of you really climaxed.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.297
- Ooh.

08:51.297 --> 08:55.668
- The winners of this
week's mini challenge are

08:55.668 --> 08:58.004
Synthia Kiss and Gia Metric.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.274
- [Synthia] Bring it in for a
hug, honey.

09:01.274 --> 09:05.011
♪ My first win as a banana ♪

09:05.011 --> 09:06.079
(laughs)

09:06.079 --> 09:09.582
- [Traci] You've each won $1.000
in cash,

09:09.582 --> 09:13.586
and $500 worth of pleasure
products from Trojan.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.023
- [Gia] Thanks, Trojan.

09:17.023 --> 09:21.027
- Have you ever had your heart
broke by a Roughneck Romeo?

09:21.027 --> 09:24.097
Maybe he left you for his
cousin?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.599
Well, if you're not ready to
make nice,

09:26.599 --> 09:29.636
it's time he pays the price.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.304
For this week's maxi challenge,

09:31.304 --> 09:34.707
you'll transform into
country pop girl groups.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.210
(all cheer)

09:37.210 --> 09:41.347
And put your own spin on our
breakup bop we're calling,

09:41.347 --> 09:42.449
"Bye Flop."

09:42.449 --> 09:43.283
(all cheer)

09:43.283 --> 09:44.317
- [Kimora] Come on.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.718
- [Traci] Working in two teams,

09:45.718 --> 09:48.288
you'll write and record original
lyrics

09:48.288 --> 09:52.358
about coming out the good
side of a bad breakup.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.495
And you'll be mentored
in the recording studio

09:55.495 --> 09:57.764
by the incomparable

09:57.764 --> 09:59.265
Bif Naked.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.167
(all cheer)

10:01.167 --> 10:03.536
- Oh my God.
- Oh no.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.637
- Whoa.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.206
Bif Naked!

10:06.206 --> 10:08.241
Oh my God, so iconic,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.243
a Canadian music legend.

10:11.878 --> 10:12.846
- That's crazy.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.380
- Synthia and Gia,

10:14.380 --> 10:16.883
as the winner of today's mini
challenge,

10:16.883 --> 10:19.052
you will be team captains.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.690
Synthia, you pick first.

10:24.858 --> 10:28.294
- [Synthia] I'm going to
go with Ms. Kendall Gender.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.229
- [Kendall] Sister.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.063
- [Synthia] Howdy, y'all.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.464
- [Kendall] Howdy, girl.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.535
Any chance to dance with
Synthia is a good day for me.

10:35.535 --> 10:38.137
- I am going to go with Pythia.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.209
- Well I love some more'a,
Kimora.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.211
(moans)

10:46.446 --> 10:48.147
(kisses)

10:48.147 --> 10:49.549
- Ice, ice, baby.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.522
- [Adriana] There's just Eve and
me.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.490
Better not be the last one.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.659
- [Synthia] I'm gone with some
Eve 6000.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.994
Come here, baby.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.700
(all laugh)

11:08.635 --> 11:10.537
- [Adriana] I'm the last one
chosen.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.171
I'm good and I'm going to show
them,

11:12.171 --> 11:14.240
they're going to regret choosing
me last.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.175
- [Traci] Y'all ready to
separate the dosey doe's

11:16.175 --> 11:17.477
from the dosey don't's?

11:17.477 --> 11:18.711
- Yeehaw.

11:18.711 --> 11:21.281
- Racers, start your engines,

11:21.281 --> 11:24.384
and made the best drag queen
win.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.287
- (unintelligible)

11:29.689 --> 11:33.826
- [Synthia] The song
is a fun take on flops

11:33.826 --> 11:35.695
in music history,

11:35.695 --> 11:39.666
pop artists who have potentially
had work not be understood.

11:39.666 --> 11:44.237
The song is also a revenge
song and it's country, y'all.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.739
- [Kimora] I don't fuck with
Taylor Swift.

11:46.739 --> 11:47.774
I don't sing.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.842
This voice is not recordable.

11:49.842 --> 11:50.910
- Okay, I have an idea.

11:50.910 --> 11:51.911
- Okay. What is it, what is it?

11:51.911 --> 11:52.879
- It's a little hokey.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.547
- Okay.
- Dosey Hoes.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.517
- Dosey Hoes, I like that.
- That is good.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.453
- So how are we feeling
about the other girl group?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.454
- I hate them all.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.823
I think they're all terrible,

12:03.823 --> 12:06.526
and I can't wait to see
them crash and burn.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.027
(group laughs)

12:08.027 --> 12:09.128
- Now how do you really feel?

12:09.128 --> 12:11.698
- (laughs)

12:11.698 --> 12:13.366
- I think we have a great group.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.501
- Yes.
- I think you did great.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.004
- It's like choosing you last.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.473
- This is a little bit of an odd
pairing.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.142
If Pythia and Adriana can bring
it

12:23.142 --> 12:24.844
like I know me and Gia can,

12:24.844 --> 12:26.546
I think we'll be fine.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.715
- What are we going to be?

12:29.549 --> 12:31.484
- Do you have any suggestions,
leader?

12:31.484 --> 12:33.086
- Keep it country.
- Yeah.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.021
- But then also we can't forget
that,

12:35.021 --> 12:36.856
like, we're a pop group.

12:36.856 --> 12:37.924
- Something with spurs?

12:37.924 --> 12:38.825
- Spurs?
- Yeah--

12:38.825 --> 12:41.628
- Those little things
in the back of the...

12:41.628 --> 12:43.730
- Learned a new word today.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.564
Spurs.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.334
- [Pythia] The other group
has really big personalities.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.168
All of them.

12:49.168 --> 12:52.238
And I wonder if they're going to
clash,

12:52.238 --> 12:54.707
or if they're actually are just
going to make it really loud

12:54.707 --> 12:55.908
and overpower us.

12:55.908 --> 12:59.245
- Let's just write it down.
- Right.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.181
- Howdy, my banjo besties.

13:02.181 --> 13:03.683
- Hi, Traci.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.085
- Well, don't y'all look
as pretty as a peach?

13:06.085 --> 13:07.687
- Hi.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.522
- What is the name of your girl
group?

13:09.522 --> 13:12.892
- We're called the--
- Dosey Hoes.

13:12.892 --> 13:13.760
- I love it,

13:13.760 --> 13:15.028
Dosey--
- Hoes.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.831
- Synthia, are you happy
with your group so far?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.767
- I'm so thrilled. This is
amazing.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.236
I'm very comfortable
in roles of leadership.

13:23.236 --> 13:28.141
I'm just cognizant of the fact
that if anything goes wrong,

13:29.108 --> 13:31.010
they're going to look towards
me.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.612
- It's about a breakup, right?
- Yes.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.414
- [Traci] So anybody wants to
share?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.215
- (unintelligible) assholes.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.116
(group laughs)

13:37.116 --> 13:38.518
- And what does that rhyme with?

13:38.518 --> 13:39.752
(group laughs)

13:39.752 --> 13:40.887
- I'm still trying to figure it
out.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.488
- Yeah, exactly. We're
workshopping.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.523
- I write songs all the time.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.424
I write lyrics all the time,

13:44.424 --> 13:45.491
so

13:45.491 --> 13:46.459
this is

13:46.459 --> 13:47.293
one of the

13:47.293 --> 13:48.294
options I had.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.263
♪ It's Eve and let me
get the numbers right ♪

13:50.263 --> 13:52.331
♪ One, two, three guys
tried to ruin my life ♪

13:52.331 --> 13:54.734
So the last time I sang it was
live,

13:54.734 --> 13:57.470
and it didn't go out
the way that I planned,

13:57.470 --> 13:59.706
so this time I'm sticking with
rap,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.141
which is something that I'm
a lot more confident with.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.309
- Now Kendall and Synthia,

14:03.309 --> 14:06.145
you actually have some girls
group history together.

14:06.145 --> 14:06.946
- We do.
- We do.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.981
- [Traci] So what is it like
reunited?

14:08.981 --> 14:11.084
- My favorite memories that
I have in my drag career

14:11.084 --> 14:13.386
actually come from being
in a group dynamic.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.220
- I always say,

14:14.220 --> 14:16.656
making sure everyone has a
voice,

14:16.656 --> 14:17.490
and you go from there,

14:17.490 --> 14:20.059
like you can really celebrate
everyone's strength.

14:20.059 --> 14:22.628
- But there's also some choreo.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.866
- [Eve] The fact that
there's not someone giving us

14:26.866 --> 14:27.900
something really challenging,

14:27.900 --> 14:30.136
and we get to decide it
ourselves is good.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.772
I'm looking forward to
challenging myself and I want,

14:32.772 --> 14:35.508
I still want the thing overall
to be really impactful.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.176
- A good point goes a long way,
honey.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.411
- [Eve] Yes.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.646
These judges are gonna eat it
up.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.615
Your country breakfast is ready.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.751
- [Group 2] Hi.
- Hello, hello.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.985
Who do we have here?

14:45.985 --> 14:48.054
- We are the Giddy Girls.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.989
(group cheers)
- [Traci] Cute.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.124
Are you happy with your group?

14:51.124 --> 14:52.291
- I am so happy.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.361
It's liberating to not have
any of the Brat Pack girls

14:55.361 --> 14:56.195
with me.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.532
This is an opportunity for
me to stand out on my own

14:59.532 --> 15:02.735
and to create a girl
group from the ground up.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.403
Bring it on, ladies.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.141
- So what's your inspiration
so far with the lyrics?

15:08.141 --> 15:11.377
- Um, I was a crazy
bitch when I was younger.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.745
- Same.
(laughs)

15:12.745 --> 15:16.716
- I'm trying to take that
and turn it positive.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.151
- Mine is just basically sort of
like,

15:18.151 --> 15:19.986
this was such a hard
time for her in her life,

15:19.986 --> 15:21.387
and now she's just moving on,

15:21.387 --> 15:24.357
and she's just ready to like
own up her bad bitch energy.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.626
I'm going with a rap verse.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.960
I don't know if I can rap,

15:27.960 --> 15:29.128
but let's see.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.131
- Are we worried at all about
the choreo?

15:32.131 --> 15:32.965
- No, no.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.937
(group laughs)
- Triggered.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.439
- The last dance challenge,

15:40.439 --> 15:42.074
I didn't do really well.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.943
We're not going to talk about
it.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.745
I'm really hoping to redeem
myself.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.014
- We're going to have a fucking
good time.

15:48.014 --> 15:51.150
We're going to dance our
little giddy booties off,

15:51.150 --> 15:53.820
and we're going to let those men
know

15:53.820 --> 15:55.188
that they mean nothing.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.022
- Mhm.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.524
All right, well giddy up girls.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.625
- Thanks, love.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.060
- Queens, listen up.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.397
Make sure your performance isn't
one note.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.631
Good luck.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.400
And don't flop it up.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.603
(all laugh)

16:10.603 --> 16:11.771
- Wait, this is kind of a look.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.772
- [Kimora] It is kind of.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.407
- [Pythia] She's like
butch lesbian, dive bar,

16:14.407 --> 16:15.341
like, "Yo."

16:19.745 --> 16:21.814
(group cheers)

16:21.814 --> 16:24.450
- [Synthia] Hi. Hello, hello.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.518
- [Kimora] Oh, here we go.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.253
- [Eve] Now it's time to record
our verses

16:27.253 --> 16:30.256
with Bif Naked. Oh my God.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.226
- Darlings, are you ready
to sing your hearts out?

16:33.226 --> 16:34.827
- [Synthia] Yes we are.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.929
- We're all born naked
and the rest is Bif.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.497
- [Bif] You want to show me what
you got?

16:38.497 --> 16:39.332
♪ A farmer named Joe ♪

16:39.332 --> 16:40.233

24:01.707 --> 24:04.543
so I felt very confident in
her sort of taking the reins

24:04.543 --> 24:06.779
and leading us all into a good
direction.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.514
- So choose your favorite dance
move,

24:08.514 --> 24:13.252
and we'll incorporate all of
our dance moves into the show.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.454
It's a huge responsibility to be

24:15.454 --> 24:17.623
in the position of team captain.

24:17.623 --> 24:22.628
I feel like I'm holding a lot
of stress on my shoulders.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.130
♪ Bye flop, bye flop ♪

24:25.130 --> 24:26.699
So we can go out two.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.401
Who wants to choose the next
move?

24:29.401 --> 24:32.104
We need to make some decisions,

24:32.104 --> 24:33.839
lock in those dance moves,

24:33.839 --> 24:37.309
but no one wants to make the
wrong choice.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.212
- All of our stories are bad
bitch energy,

24:40.212 --> 24:41.680
so it's like,

24:41.680 --> 24:42.648
we're brushing them off.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.482
- So we go,

24:43.482 --> 24:44.316
Boom,

24:44.316 --> 24:45.150
boom,

24:45.150 --> 24:46.051
boom, boom,

24:46.051 --> 24:46.885
boom.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.854
- [Pythia] I am scared that
we are going to be engulfed

24:48.854 --> 24:51.390
by all these big personalities
of the other group,

24:51.390 --> 24:53.325
so we have to bring it.

24:55.094 --> 24:59.098
- [Kimora] Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.266
- [Kendall] It is elimination
day.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.835
I'm vibing with the girls

25:02.835 --> 25:04.636
and I'm excited to get on the
stage.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.739
Ooh, let's have a kiki.

25:06.739 --> 25:09.308
- How's everybody feeling
about their groups?

25:09.308 --> 25:10.409
- So amazing.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.144
- Right, like--

25:12.144 --> 25:13.545
- Yeah, it feels correct.

25:13.545 --> 25:17.282
- I think I'm feeling
like topping this week.

25:19.618 --> 25:22.020
- I was going to say your
blouse is giving me bottom.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.256
(all laugh)

25:24.256 --> 25:25.524
- Fuck you.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.025
- Okay, bye flops.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.394
Let's get in drag.

25:28.394 --> 25:31.463
(all cheer)

25:31.463 --> 25:33.432
- [Adriana] I love our songs.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.033
Oh my God. It's like pop
country.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.502
- I know.

25:36.502 --> 25:37.970
- Do you like country songs?

25:37.970 --> 25:38.804
- I do.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.773
A lot of people don't
realize that country music

25:40.773 --> 25:43.675
has a lot of roots in the black
culture.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.611
- Oh really?
- Same thing with rock music,

25:45.611 --> 25:50.249
all of that stems from a
lot of black greatness.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.350
- It's so nice to know that.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.518
I didn't know, thank you.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.786
- Yeah, that's just it.

25:53.786 --> 25:54.953
And that's why I love to say

25:54.953 --> 25:57.823
that Black History Month
shouldn't just happen in
February.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.859
Bitch, we all can learn--
- 365 days a year.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.694
- [Kimora] Baby, amen.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.432
- [Synthia] So, Icesis.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.300
- Yes, my love, what's up?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.936
- Do you have much of a
drag family back home?

26:10.936 --> 26:14.840
- I do. My drag family
is a little interesting.

26:15.908 --> 26:16.909
- Ooh, I like that.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.278
- My younger brother is my drag
daughter.

26:19.278 --> 26:20.979
(all gasp)

26:20.979 --> 26:21.814
- [Icesis] Yeah.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.715
I used to, like, sneak him into
the clubs

26:23.715 --> 26:25.384
to carry my bags and stuff,

26:25.384 --> 26:26.685
and he was always like in awe,

26:26.685 --> 26:27.953
so once he became legal,

26:27.953 --> 26:29.588
I put him in drag and he was
like,

26:29.588 --> 26:30.589
I want you to be my drag mom,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.090
And I was like,
(retches)

26:32.090 --> 26:33.325
He has

26:33.325 --> 26:34.393
literally

26:34.393 --> 26:35.394
been with me

26:35.394 --> 26:38.430
through this whole entire drag
journey.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.065
He's just, like, learned so
much,

26:40.065 --> 26:43.068
and I'm just so proud of him.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.505
The first four years of him
doing drag,

26:46.505 --> 26:47.840
I was doing his makeup,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.041
I was doing everything.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.176
- So cute. What's their drag
name?

26:51.176 --> 26:52.978
- Her name's Savannah.
- [Synthia] Savannah.

26:52.978 --> 26:54.313
- [Icesis] Savannah Couture.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.515
- [Synthia] I love that.
- [Icesis] Isn't it cute?

26:56.515 --> 26:57.516
We've toured together.

26:57.516 --> 27:00.352
We do, like, little choreography
together.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.720
We have like little numbers.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.788
Very, very cute.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.490
- My dad is actually gay.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.557
- What?
- Yeah.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.391
(all gasp)

27:06.391 --> 27:07.226
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:07.226 --> 27:11.096
So he kind of later in
life realized his identity.

27:11.096 --> 27:13.398
When people hear that my dad is
gay,

27:13.398 --> 27:16.535
the jump assumption is that
it must've been very easy,

27:16.535 --> 27:20.138
you know, how lucky to
have a father understand

27:20.138 --> 27:21.974
their queer son.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.141
That has taken time,

27:23.141 --> 27:27.613
and I would be lying if I
were to say it's all flawless.

27:27.613 --> 27:28.447
It was kind of weird.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.483
We were like coming out of
the closet at the same time.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.317
- As your dad?

27:32.317 --> 27:34.286
- [Synthia] Yeah, it was very
interesting.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.389
I didn't understand what he was
doing.

27:37.389 --> 27:41.226
I didn't know he was trying
to conceal that about himself,

27:41.226 --> 27:42.728
because there were never
dialogues.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.764
I always push him to be
more confident in himself.

27:45.764 --> 27:50.035
I definitely know he is
more a victim of his times.

27:50.035 --> 27:52.237
Like Catholic guilt runs deep.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.438
- Later start.

27:53.438 --> 27:54.573
- Oh, totally.

27:54.573 --> 27:58.677
It was this moment of
don't shine too bright.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.512
It's going to kind of out me.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.446
I fought through,

28:01.446 --> 28:02.381
I-I thought,

28:02.381 --> 28:04.283
Okay, here's a trail for me to
blaze.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.385
Like if you're too

28:06.385 --> 28:07.653
ashamed

28:07.653 --> 28:09.421
to be openly gay,

28:09.421 --> 28:10.923
that's your journey.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.558
But I will be doing me.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.892
I will be openly gay.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.994
- You probably inspire him a lot
too.

28:15.994 --> 28:17.296
- It feels weird saying that.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.897
It's a huge part of why I'm
here,

28:18.897 --> 28:21.500
just to show what an authentic,

28:22.401 --> 28:24.002
open life looks like.

28:24.002 --> 28:25.037
I don't know how he hid,

28:25.037 --> 28:26.471
he's a flaming 'mo.

28:26.471 --> 28:28.640
(all laugh)
He's very over the top.

28:28.640 --> 28:31.877
No, I'm so excited to share
this experience with him.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.879
- Oh, I can't wait for him to
see!

28:33.879 --> 28:37.482
- He adores Drag Race
so this'll be a trip.

28:38.617 --> 28:40.552
- [Gia] Hey Giddy Girls,
altogether now.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.987
Give me a yeehaw!

28:41.987 --> 28:43.889
- [Giddy Girls] Yeehaw!

28:45.190 --> 28:46.858
- [Synthia] All right, now Dosey
Hoes,

28:46.858 --> 28:48.226
We can do a little bit better
than that.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.728
Can I get a yeehaw?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.930
- [Dosey Hoes] Yeehaw!

28:51.930 --> 28:54.266
(Kimora vocalizes)

28:54.266 --> 28:56.568
- [Gia] We're not going to
let them do that, Giddy Girls.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.869
Come on, come on.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.304
On the count of three, yeehaw.

28:59.304 --> 29:00.772
One, two, three, yeehaw!

29:00.772 --> 29:03.208

29:40.912 --> 29:44.216
He's a little bit country,
it's Brad Goreski.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.150

29:45.150 --> 29:46.151
- Hi, Brad.

29:46.151 --> 29:46.985
- You know,

29:46.985 --> 29:49.821
I'd actually say I'm a little
bit more cunty than country.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.757

sentiment.

- The family resemblance is
uncanny.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.633
- I think it's the breasts.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.568

- I felt the pressure

41:41.566 --> 41:45.303
throughout the whole experience
knowing I was captain.

41:45.303 --> 41:46.137
In the end of the day,

41:46.137 --> 41:48.706
I feel like we all had our
voices heard.

41:48.706 --> 41:51.509
So in some ways I am
going to stick to my guns,

41:51.509 --> 41:52.610
and say no.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.646
- It looked like everyone
had a say in everything.

41:55.646 --> 41:57.315
Collectively it was a bit of a
mess.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.516
You did very well.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.851
- Thank you.
- Like, your verse was great.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.819
I loved the fact that
you changed the level

42:01.819 --> 42:03.554
and it was kind of the
breakdown before the big,

42:03.554 --> 42:05.123
final chorus and it really
worked.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.758
But there was not a
cohesiveness,

42:06.758 --> 42:07.792
there was no unity.

42:07.792 --> 42:09.660
- [Traci] Not everybody
knew the choreography,

42:09.660 --> 42:11.963
so it was kind of disjointed.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.831
- [Brooke Lynn] On the runway,

42:13.831 --> 42:15.566
it's just not enough for me.

42:15.566 --> 42:18.002
I would have loved it if there
was more volume in that hair.

42:18.002 --> 42:18.836
- [Synthia] Okay.

42:18.836 --> 42:21.038
- And also, can you take your
glasses off?

42:21.038 --> 42:23.307
I would've loved to see your,
like, face on the runway.

42:23.307 --> 42:24.142
I love the effect,

42:24.142 --> 42:25.476
but at some point I want
the glasses to come off

42:25.476 --> 42:26.711
so I can see you.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.746
- [Bif] I love velvet.

42:28.746 --> 42:33.584
I want to rub you because
the velvet is so rubbable.

42:33.584 --> 42:35.119
- See, it's not all bad,

42:35.119 --> 42:36.621
but some of it is.

42:37.955 --> 42:39.891
Kendall Gender.
- Hello.

42:39.891 --> 42:43.261
- The category was
Monochromatica:

42:43.261 --> 42:45.062
Futuristic Pop Princess.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.698
I feel like this is current pop
princess.

42:47.698 --> 42:48.566
It's a little,

42:48.566 --> 42:51.202
comparatively speaking, basic.

42:51.202 --> 42:52.036
- Okay.

42:52.036 --> 42:55.306
- The shape that you
created in the performance,

42:55.306 --> 42:56.140
I was like,

42:56.140 --> 42:57.742
where does that come from?

42:57.742 --> 42:58.976
- I love that.
- [Brad] It was amazing.

42:58.976 --> 43:01.446
And I'm wondering if there was a
way that

43:01.446 --> 43:03.548
that could have happened in this
as well?

43:03.548 --> 43:05.783
The skirty thing kind of
covers up the part of you--

43:05.783 --> 43:07.151
- [Kendall] Totally.
- That creates the most.

43:07.151 --> 43:08.586
- You mean your favorite part?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.321
- [Brad] Girl, I live.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.924
- [Traci] Your performance
tonight with Synthia again.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.159
I feel like you two are
really strong together

43:15.159 --> 43:17.128
and you communicate well.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.231
I feel like not everybody
might've been included

43:20.231 --> 43:22.200
in that synergy.

43:22.200 --> 43:25.403
- Your verse was probably my
least favorite of the four.

43:25.403 --> 43:27.371
- Okay.
- But to watch you perform,

43:27.371 --> 43:28.372
it's always fun.

43:28.372 --> 43:29.607
Just light up a stage.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.808
Just do it naturally.

43:30.808 --> 43:32.176
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

43:32.176 --> 43:33.511
- Eve 6000.
- Hi.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.948
- The aesthetic is just--
(kisses)

43:36.948 --> 43:41.018
- [Brad] You have taken
the stoned body suit,

43:41.018 --> 43:43.454
and for me it looks just really
cool.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.922
I love the one shoulder.

43:44.922 --> 43:46.958
I love the different materials.

43:46.958 --> 43:50.661
The place where I start
getting a little stressed out

43:50.661 --> 43:52.530
is when the performance comes
up.

43:52.530 --> 43:55.433
I know you have this thing
inside you

43:55.433 --> 43:57.635
that once you pop it open,

43:57.635 --> 44:00.805
it's just going to be like
powerhouse.

44:00.805 --> 44:03.140
- When we spoke about your
verse in the Werk Room,

44:03.140 --> 44:06.310
I was really excited to
see you perform it tonight.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.312
But the choreo.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.146
- (sighs)

44:09.146 --> 44:10.815
- I felt like you were
struggling.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.283
- I'm not a dancer.

44:12.283 --> 44:13.184
I've, like,

44:13.184 --> 44:16.320
never really danced in my life,
so--

44:16.320 --> 44:17.822
- But you're theatrical,

44:17.822 --> 44:19.590
and we've seen that from you.

44:19.590 --> 44:20.424
- Yeah.

44:20.424 --> 44:21.359
- Your performance,

44:21.359 --> 44:23.427
it was a little more subtle.

44:23.427 --> 44:24.495
Because it's this stage,

44:24.495 --> 44:26.130
it has to be theater.

44:26.130 --> 44:27.198
- Yeah.

44:27.198 --> 44:28.633
- I could hear the lack of
energy,

44:28.633 --> 44:32.003
and then I saw the lack of
energy when you were performing.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.070
I'm a little frustrated too,

44:33.070 --> 44:33.905
to be honest with you--
- Yeah.

44:33.905 --> 44:35.306
because you are so talented.

44:35.306 --> 44:37.942
And I feel like we have
given you the most attention

44:37.942 --> 44:39.510
out of anybody in this
competition.

44:39.510 --> 44:42.046
- That's kind of what has
been really difficult for me

44:42.046 --> 44:45.516
because I kind of feel
like I'm always up here

44:45.516 --> 44:46.551
and it's really hard

44:46.551 --> 44:49.754
to always hear all of
the negative critiques,

44:49.754 --> 44:52.490
- But Eve, truly we all
want to see you succeed.

44:52.490 --> 44:54.258
You're on Canada's Drag Race for
a reason.

44:54.258 --> 44:55.092
- Yeah.

44:55.092 --> 44:57.028
- You have to believe now.
- Yeah.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.296
- [Traci] Hi, Kimora.

44:58.296 --> 45:00.464
You have such a passion
and a pride in your drag

45:00.464 --> 45:02.033
and it really shows.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.901
Your performance is
part of the Dosey Hoes.

45:03.901 --> 45:07.972
The look was very round-the-way
girl goes to a honky-tonk.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.206
- That's exactly it.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.775
- Thank you, I got it!
(Kimora laughing)

45:10.775 --> 45:13.611
- I want to look like
I should not be here,

45:13.611 --> 45:15.212
but I'm here to have a little
fun.

45:15.212 --> 45:18.115
- Absolutely.
- (laughs)

45:18.115 --> 45:19.717
- Your light,

45:19.717 --> 45:20.885
fluffy,

45:20.885 --> 45:21.819
cloudy

45:21.819 --> 45:22.787
confection

45:22.787 --> 45:24.255
just gave me the lift

45:24.255 --> 45:25.790
I needed today.

45:25.790 --> 45:27.425
- The one thing about your
performance,

45:27.425 --> 45:29.727
I would like to have
seen you be center stage

45:29.727 --> 45:30.661
a little bit more.

45:30.661 --> 45:32.063
- I loved your verse.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.130
I thought you sounded great.

45:33.130 --> 45:35.266
The look from the front, it's
gorgeous.

45:35.266 --> 45:38.369
I really wish there had been
an appliqué put on the back,

45:38.369 --> 45:40.972
because when you turn
around that panty line

45:40.972 --> 45:43.808
is really, really visible.

45:43.808 --> 45:46.143
Those little details are really
important.

45:46.143 --> 45:47.745
- I never saw myself from the
back.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.113
- Oh, well wait until you do.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.315
(all laugh)

45:51.315 --> 45:52.617
Thank you, Kimora.

45:52.617 --> 45:53.684
Thank you, queens.

45:53.684 --> 45:55.519
I think we've heard enough.

45:55.519 --> 45:57.555
While you untuck backstage,

45:57.555 --> 45:59.957
the judges will square dance.

46:03.027 --> 46:05.262
- Oh my God, we totally just
won.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.831
- [Adriana] Yes, Giddy Girls
just won.

46:06.831 --> 46:07.665
Yeehaw!

46:08.666 --> 46:10.334
Oh my God.

46:10.334 --> 46:12.870
Winner winner, chicken dinner?

46:12.870 --> 46:14.739
Yeah, chicken dinner.

46:14.739 --> 46:16.774
- I'm so fucking proud of us.

46:16.774 --> 46:19.443
We went from fucking zero to a
hundred.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.746
- This is the second dance
challenge.

46:21.746 --> 46:24.081
I think I redeemed myself.

46:24.081 --> 46:25.716
I think I killed it.

46:25.716 --> 46:27.451
I'm very, very proud of myself.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.720
Like proud enough that I
thought I should have won.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.789
But like, I mean, I get it.

46:31.789 --> 46:32.590
It's fine.

46:33.991 --> 46:35.326
- Bitches.
- Hi.

46:37.161 --> 46:38.729
- Howdy-hoo.

46:38.729 --> 46:39.563
- [Eve] Would you believe it?

46:39.563 --> 46:41.032
I won the challenge.

46:41.032 --> 46:42.133
- Oh my God.

46:42.133 --> 46:44.368
- Don't you steal this moment
from me, you little bitch.

46:44.368 --> 46:45.202
(all laugh)

46:45.202 --> 46:48.139
- So ladies, what happened
on that main stage?

46:48.139 --> 46:49.573
We're dying to know.

46:49.573 --> 46:52.243
- They commented from the front,

46:52.243 --> 46:53.511
it's fabulous.

46:53.511 --> 46:55.379
But baby from the back.

46:55.379 --> 46:57.815
There's a little bit of an
issue with my panty line,

46:57.815 --> 46:58.649
and for me, that,

46:58.649 --> 46:59.784
that hits home because it was
like,

46:59.784 --> 47:01.519
I know better than that.

47:01.519 --> 47:04.255
- Most of the judges
said my performance was,

47:04.255 --> 47:05.723
was relatively good.

47:05.723 --> 47:07.124
- [Eve] No, they said your
performance was great.

47:07.124 --> 47:07.958
- [Kendall] They said it was,

47:07.958 --> 47:09.760
they didn't love the verse
itself.

47:09.760 --> 47:10.594
- Oh.

47:10.594 --> 47:12.530
- [Kendall] But they liked
the way I delivered it.

47:12.530 --> 47:15.099
So it's kind of like, it's a
50-50.

47:15.099 --> 47:17.668
We really don't know who's
going to be lip-syncing tonight.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.137
It could be all of us for all we
know.

47:20.137 --> 47:22.940
- [Eve] Brooke Lynn had kind
of the same critique for me

47:22.940 --> 47:24.308
that she's had multiple times,

47:24.308 --> 47:26.043
where she basically just said
that

47:26.043 --> 47:28.379
she, like, didn't see my
performance--

47:28.379 --> 47:30.247
- She said you're dead behind
the eyes.

47:30.247 --> 47:31.482
- Well, she didn't say exactly
that,

47:31.482 --> 47:32.316
but she said,

47:32.316 --> 47:33.484
she said something like that.

47:33.484 --> 47:34.685
- When they say,

47:34.685 --> 47:37.588
we know you have that untapped
potential

47:37.588 --> 47:38.989
at all times.

47:38.989 --> 47:39.824
What resonates there--

47:39.824 --> 47:42.059
- [Eve] I know that I'm
talented and I can perform.

47:42.059 --> 47:43.494
Being in the bottom so many
times

47:43.494 --> 47:45.529
and hearing negative, negative,
negative,

47:45.529 --> 47:46.430
negative, negative.

47:46.430 --> 47:47.531
Now believe in yourself.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.033
It's like--

47:49.033 --> 47:51.001
- We can bring the best fashion,

47:51.001 --> 47:52.603
be the most polished.

47:52.603 --> 47:54.438
But it's the personalities--
- [Eve] Yeah.

47:54.438 --> 47:55.272
- People are--

47:55.272 --> 47:56.540
- [Eve] Saying that doesn't
really help

47:56.540 --> 47:57.374
because it's like,

47:57.374 --> 47:59.210
Hey, you're reminding me--
- [Synthia] I know, girl.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.578
But dwelling on it.

48:00.578 --> 48:02.113
- Well, I'm not, I'm not
dwelling on it.

48:02.113 --> 48:03.514
- Well, a little bit.

48:03.514 --> 48:04.648
- No, no, I'm not dwelling on
it.

48:04.648 --> 48:05.483
I'm being asked about it.

48:05.483 --> 48:06.550
I'm talking about it.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.886
Don't therapize me right now.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.021
I'm not interested in
a group therapy session

48:11.021 --> 48:12.490
every fucking week.

48:12.490 --> 48:15.426
And I'm allowed to feel how I
feel.

48:17.661 --> 48:19.330
- I'm so worried they're going
to,

48:19.330 --> 48:20.164
they're going to put me in the
bottom

48:20.164 --> 48:21.699
because of the captain role.

48:21.699 --> 48:23.234
- [Gia] It's like all eyes on
you.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.069
What could you have done
differently?

48:25.069 --> 48:27.004
- Knowing we didn't excel,

48:27.004 --> 48:28.873
it's the target on my back.

48:28.873 --> 48:31.308
It's all questions going to
Synth.

48:31.308 --> 48:34.211
- Someone had to be on the
bottom and we were very good,

48:34.211 --> 48:35.045
so...

48:35.045 --> 48:37.481
(all laugh)

48:37.481 --> 48:38.749
- Yes, Adriana.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.585
- Oh, Adriana's coming
out with the shade today!

48:41.585 --> 48:44.755
- All right. So just
between us reverse cowgirls,

48:44.755 --> 48:47.124
(all chuckle)
What do we think?

48:47.124 --> 48:50.227
Let's start with our captain,
Synthia.

48:50.227 --> 48:52.763
You could tell there were too
many cooks in the kitchen.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.765
That has to fall on her as the
captain.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.100
I enjoyed her verse,

48:56.100 --> 48:58.435
but that runway look?

48:58.435 --> 49:00.171
(Traci groans)
(horse lips)

49:00.171 --> 49:01.839
- [Brad] It was velvet,

49:01.839 --> 49:03.207
it was kind of pink,

49:03.207 --> 49:05.676
it was kind of futuristic,

49:05.676 --> 49:07.611
but it really missed the mark
for me.

49:07.611 --> 49:09.580
- But I like her singing voice a
lot.

49:09.580 --> 49:10.447
- [Brooke Lynn] Mmm-hmm.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.850
Her solo in the performance was
very good.

49:12.850 --> 49:13.918
And I loved that she sang,

49:13.918 --> 49:15.419
but just all the other things

49:15.419 --> 49:17.454
and the responsibility she had
this week,

49:17.454 --> 49:19.423
Synthia kissed the mark.

49:19.423 --> 49:20.357
- Mhm.

49:20.357 --> 49:23.527
- All right, up next, we have
Eve 6000.

49:23.527 --> 49:26.230
- I was kind of upset when

49:26.230 --> 49:31.235
Eve said that she's taking
all of this criticism to heart

49:31.535 --> 49:33.671
and getting inside of her head.

49:33.671 --> 49:35.906
Her attitude is reflecting that.

49:35.906 --> 49:37.208
- [Brooke Lynn] We are giving
critiques

49:37.208 --> 49:40.144
to all these other girls
and they are ingesting them

49:40.144 --> 49:42.379
and coming back better.

49:42.379 --> 49:43.714
And she's not.

49:43.714 --> 49:48.152
- We all really love Eve
6000 and we love her drag,

49:48.152 --> 49:50.487
but we want it to be unlocked.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.757
- You should take that criticism
and be motivated by it.

49:53.757 --> 49:56.360
As someone who is a performer,

49:56.360 --> 49:59.396
you have to be twice as good
sometimes

49:59.396 --> 50:01.065
to be considered half as good.

50:01.065 --> 50:01.899
- Mhm.

50:01.899 --> 50:03.801
- And you have to keep doing it
anyway.

50:03.801 --> 50:05.803
- We need to talk about Kendall
Gender.

50:05.803 --> 50:08.472
- Kendall's verse wasn't my
favorite,

50:08.472 --> 50:11.308
but she performed the hell out
of it.

50:11.308 --> 50:12.676
- She has a command,

50:12.676 --> 50:14.511
not only of the runway,

50:14.511 --> 50:15.646
but of her audience.

50:15.646 --> 50:17.014
- [Brooke Lynn] We see her and
we smile,

50:17.014 --> 50:18.716
because she does light up a
stage.

50:18.716 --> 50:19.950
She lights up a room.

50:19.950 --> 50:20.784
- She

50:20.784 --> 50:21.619
looked so

50:22.486 --> 50:23.320
beautiful

50:23.320 --> 50:24.154
in the performance,

50:24.154 --> 50:24.989
and I was like,

50:24.989 --> 50:26.423
Wow, that silhouette.

50:26.423 --> 50:28.626
And then in the runway,

50:28.626 --> 50:30.661
that look covered it up.

50:30.661 --> 50:31.829
I've seen this vibe.

50:31.829 --> 50:33.097
I've seen the feathers.

50:33.097 --> 50:34.765
I've seen the body suit.

50:34.765 --> 50:37.501
I want to see a more elevated
look.

50:37.501 --> 50:40.237
- It was a bar dance
costume a little bit to me.

50:40.237 --> 50:41.906
It wasn't on the same level.

50:41.906 --> 50:42.973
Kimora Amour.

50:43.807 --> 50:48.178
- When Kimora Amour
glides down that runway,

50:48.178 --> 50:50.948
it just makes my soul sing.

50:50.948 --> 50:52.983
Her performance, however,

50:52.983 --> 50:56.053
felt like she's such an
amazing, talented personality,

50:56.053 --> 50:58.856
and she put herself almost in
the shadows.

50:58.856 --> 50:59.690
- At times I was like,

50:59.690 --> 51:01.525
Where's, where's, where did
Kimora go?

51:01.525 --> 51:02.359
- [Brooke Lynn] The problem was

51:02.359 --> 51:04.328
it just was not cohesive
with the rest of the group.

51:04.328 --> 51:05.496
Part of that blame, again,

51:05.496 --> 51:08.365
falls to Synthia as the team
captain.

51:08.365 --> 51:11.035
I really want Kimora to
step into the spotlight,

51:11.035 --> 51:15.205
and show us that she is
Canada's next drag superstar.

51:15.205 --> 51:16.273
All right.
(sighs)

51:16.273 --> 51:18.842
Have we made our decision?

51:18.842 --> 51:21.345
Bring back our floppy toppies.

51:22.413 --> 51:24.815
Welcome back, queens.

51:24.815 --> 51:27.151
We have made some decisions.

51:28.585 --> 51:29.687
Kimora Amour,

51:32.523 --> 51:33.624
you are safe.

51:35.559 --> 51:38.629
Please move to the back of the
stage.

51:42.132 --> 51:42.967
Eve 6000,

51:44.168 --> 51:47.338
on the runway, you took us to
the moon,

51:47.338 --> 51:49.873
but your performance in
the girl group challenge

51:49.873 --> 51:51.875
needed some serious TLC.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.114
I'm sorry, my dear,

51:57.114 --> 51:59.717
but you are up for elimination.

52:02.186 --> 52:03.253
Synthia Kiss,

52:04.288 --> 52:07.958
your performance in the
maxi challenge was supreme,

52:07.958 --> 52:09.259
but on the runway,

52:09.259 --> 52:12.229
your monochromatic look was

52:12.229 --> 52:13.497
mono-traumatic.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.599
Kendall Gender,

52:16.633 --> 52:17.801
in the challenge,

52:17.801 --> 52:20.070
you were a joy to watch,

52:20.070 --> 52:23.240
but your runway look is not top
notch.

52:27.111 --> 52:28.379
Kendall Gender,

52:29.413 --> 52:30.481
you are safe.

52:32.249 --> 52:35.419
You may head to the back of the
stage.

52:40.457 --> 52:41.925
Synthia Kiss,

52:41.925 --> 52:42.793
I'm so sorry,

52:42.793 --> 52:46.063
but this means you are for
elimination.

52:47.064 --> 52:49.333
Two queens stand before us.

52:51.535 --> 52:52.803
Prior to tonight,

52:52.803 --> 52:55.205
you were asked to prepare
a lip-sync performance

52:55.205 --> 52:58.275
of Bif Naked's "I Love Myself
Today."

52:59.476 --> 53:03.747
Queens, this is your last
chance to impress the judges

53:03.747 --> 53:06.683
and save yourself from
elimination.

53:08.318 --> 53:10.120
The time has come--
(thunder rumbles)

53:10.120 --> 53:12.156
for you to lip sync

53:12.156 --> 53:13.090
for

53:13.090 --> 53:14.158
your

53:14.158 --> 53:14.958
life.

53:17.361 --> 53:19.029
- [Eve] I am channeling Ms. Bif
Naked.

53:19.029 --> 53:20.564
She is right in front of me

53:20.564 --> 53:22.766
and I'm going to deliver that
song

53:22.766 --> 53:25.102
like I'm in her fucking music
video.

53:25.102 --> 53:26.904
- [Synthia] I definitely did
not think I was going to be

53:26.904 --> 53:28.105
in the bottom this week.

53:28.105 --> 53:30.908
Heavy is the head that
wears the captain crown,

53:30.908 --> 53:32.543
but baby,

53:32.543 --> 53:34.244
I'm a lip sync assassin.

53:34.244 --> 53:35.846
- Good luck,

53:35.846 --> 53:37.047
and don't

53:37.047 --> 53:38.382
fuck

53:38.382 --> 53:39.817
it

53:39.817 --> 53:41.018

(all cheer)

55:47.010 --> 55:48.245
- Love you too.

55:56.520 --> 56:00.691
- [Brooke Lynn] Queens,
we have made our decision.

56:05.329 --> 56:06.396
Synthia Kiss,

56:08.532 --> 56:09.967
shantay you stay.

56:12.135 --> 56:12.970
- Thank you guys.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.204
Thank you so much.

56:14.204 --> 56:17.541
- [Brooke Lynn] You may join the
others.

56:23.647 --> 56:24.448
Eve 6000,

56:25.749 --> 56:28.685
your time here may have come to
an end,

56:28.685 --> 56:33.423
but this is just the eve
of a brand new era for you.

56:33.423 --> 56:35.158
You are a star,

56:35.158 --> 56:36.560
we all know it,

56:36.560 --> 56:38.895
and it's time for you to know
it.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.898
But right now is not your time.

56:41.898 --> 56:44.434
So please sashay away.

56:44.434 --> 56:45.836
- Thank you so much.

56:45.836 --> 56:47.204
- Thank you.

56:47.204 --> 56:48.538
- Love you, Eve.

56:49.973 --> 56:50.941
- Oh my gosh.

56:50.941 --> 56:52.209
Well,

56:52.209 --> 56:54.211
let's call this era

56:54.211 --> 56:56.313
my purposeful flop.

56:56.313 --> 56:59.182
(all laugh)

56:59.182 --> 57:00.984
Now it's time for me to
take my flat wigs elsewhere,

57:00.984 --> 57:01.818
all right?

57:01.818 --> 57:05.088
(all laugh)
Thank you.

57:07.357 --> 57:11.561
I came here to represent for
all the non-binary people

57:11.561 --> 57:13.430
and also for all the big girls,

57:13.430 --> 57:15.565
because I think it's
really important to show

57:15.565 --> 57:18.669
that big girls can be polished,

57:18.669 --> 57:19.936
stunning,

57:19.936 --> 57:20.871
and you know,

57:20.871 --> 57:22.606
have it altogether.

57:22.606 --> 57:23.840
Polished presentation,

57:23.840 --> 57:25.942
messy personality.

57:25.942 --> 57:26.777
That's me.

57:27.611 --> 57:28.445
Okay.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.613
As soon as I get out of here

57:29.613 --> 57:31.214
and get my hands back on my
phone,

57:31.214 --> 57:33.950
I'm going to block Brooke
Lynn Hytes immediately

57:33.950 --> 57:35.218
on all social media.

57:35.218 --> 57:37.287
(laughs)

57:38.422 --> 57:40.657
- [Brooke Lynn]
Condragualations, queens.

57:40.657 --> 57:43.060
You live to slay another day,

57:43.960 --> 57:45.562

57:45.562 --> 57:46.897
stay true north,

57:47.931 --> 57:48.799
strong,

57:48.799 --> 57:49.833
and what?

57:49.833 --> 57:51.501
- [Everyone] Fierce!

on Canada's Drag Race.

58:15.125 --> 58:16.626
- We're throwing

58:16.626 --> 58:17.461
a ball.

58:17.461 --> 58:19.796
(all cheer)

58:19.796 --> 58:21.832
- [Icesis] Looking around the
room,

58:21.832 --> 58:24.267
Kimora might be in trouble.

58:24.267 --> 58:25.402
How's things going?

58:25.402 --> 58:26.503
- Horrible.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.439
There's not enough material
in here to cover my ass.

58:29.439 --> 58:30.907
- [Kendall] I really want to
take the note

58:30.907 --> 58:33.543
from the judges and push myself.

58:33.543 --> 58:35.078
This is ambitious.

58:35.078 --> 58:37.247
- I actually quite
enjoyed that first look.

58:37.247 --> 58:38.749
- Me too.
- I loved it.

58:38.749 --> 58:40.350
- I'm so mad.
- [Amanda] Me too.

58:40.350 --> 58:41.518
- You're so mad?
- Mhm.

58:41.518 --> 58:42.352
- I'm mad.

58:42.352 --> 58:43.186
- Well, you're wrong.

58:43.186 --> 58:45.355
- Well, so is your hair, so
there we go.

58:45.355 --> 58:46.623
- Fight, fight.
