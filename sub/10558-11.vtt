01:02.208 --> 01:03.808
This is a miserable business.

01:03.988 --> 01:07.588
Believe me, the prosecutor's office
takes no pleasure in it,

01:07.588 --> 01:11.168
but Cecil Fox did kill a judge,
a dear colleague.

01:11.168 --> 01:14.588
I meant no disrespect.
Judge Mead was a fine man.

01:14.588 --> 01:16.988
I hope you're not
a faint-hearted sort.

01:16.988 --> 01:19.928
Fox crawled out of hell
to be born.

01:19.928 --> 01:23.028
Mr Dillard and me,
we're just shipping him back.

01:23.028 --> 01:26.588
Even so, Detective MacDonald,
bearing witness to execution

01:26.588 --> 01:29.028
is a duty
I will never grow accustomed to.

01:29.028 --> 01:31.328
I'll take good care.

01:40.012 --> 01:44.492
Thank God I caught this bugger.
Some men just deserve to die.

01:44.492 --> 01:47.732
Those who argue the ethics
of capital punishment

01:47.732 --> 01:50.032
forget we are delivering

01:50.032 --> 01:52.572
society's unwavering
response to evil.

01:52.572 --> 01:55.092
The Lord's Prayer.

01:55.092 --> 01:56.912
Our father...

02:01.352 --> 02:03.552
CREAKING ROPE

02:22.409 --> 02:23.529
Delivery.

02:23.529 --> 02:28.369
Mr Catchpole.
And this must be Mr Cecil Fox.

02:28.369 --> 02:32.489
Yes, ma'am.
Well, help me get him on the table
so I can dispense with formalities.

02:32.489 --> 02:33.669
Ready?

02:41.049 --> 02:43.129
Is there something else,
Mr Catchpole?

02:43.129 --> 02:46.429
Mr Pleasant says I'm
the best apprentice he's ever had.

02:46.429 --> 02:50.389
Oh! Well, good for you.

02:50.389 --> 02:54.069
I'll be the best hangman
that ever was, too.

02:56.329 --> 02:57.309
I don't doubt it.

02:59.869 --> 03:03.709
Well, you best be off. Yes, ma'am.

03:05.189 --> 03:08.029
Good to see you, Dr Ogden.

03:42.109 --> 03:45.289
One more sound and you're dead.

03:57.629 --> 04:00.449
You've had quite a shock, Julia.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.409
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine, William.

04:06.729 --> 04:09.049
Sir, this metal tube?

04:09.049 --> 04:13.449
Yes, George, it would appear that Mr
Fox has given himself a tracheotomy.

04:13.449 --> 04:16.249
You mean he jammed this thing
into his own throat?

04:16.249 --> 04:19.668
Windpipe, to be precise. Eurgh...
He'd have been able to breathe

04:19.668 --> 04:22.649
shallowly as he hung from the rope.
Hardly noticeable.

04:22.649 --> 04:26.269
But Dr, when a man
is hanged, the neck is snapped

04:26.269 --> 04:29.289
from the spine, is it not?
The C2 vertebra.

04:29.289 --> 04:30.869
How could Fox have survived,

04:30.869 --> 04:34.609
even if he did have a...trae,
Trae... A tracheaenemy...?

04:34.609 --> 04:37.829
Yes, George, clearly Mr Fox's
neck wasn't broken.

04:37.829 --> 04:41.229
I suspect this was no accident.
We'll have to speak
with the hangman.

04:41.229 --> 04:43.069
Theodore Pleasant, yes, sir.

04:43.069 --> 04:45.749
Are you aware that he
and the Inspector are old friends?

04:46.929 --> 04:49.529
No, George, I wasn't aware of that.
Thank you.

04:54.569 --> 04:55.989
'Are you being serious?'

04:55.989 --> 04:59.209
Theo Pleasant botching
a hanging to let a killer go free?

04:59.209 --> 05:02.329
I would have interviewed him
straightaway but given
your relationship,

05:02.329 --> 05:04.669
I thought you might want
to accompany me.

05:04.669 --> 05:07.249
You're damn right.
20 years in the job

05:07.249 --> 05:09.929
and he's not mucked up
a single execution.

05:09.929 --> 05:12.249
Murdoch, we have visitors.

05:13.749 --> 05:16.869
Now, listen, Detective MacDonald's
an obvious dunce,

05:16.869 --> 05:19.129
but the Crown Prosecutor's
the top dog.

05:20.849 --> 05:23.669
He could make life difficult
if we bugger this up, right?

05:25.049 --> 05:28.669
Fox drove a blade into the judge
who sentenced him to hard labour.

05:28.669 --> 05:31.869
He'd happily kill a few civilians
if it meant his freedom.

05:31.869 --> 05:35.969
We've got the train stations,
the waterfront and hospitals covered.
Fox won't get far.

05:37.309 --> 05:44.929
All right, then. For a half-wit
like Fox to survive the hanging,
he must have had help.

05:44.929 --> 05:46.749
I'd be talking to that hangman.

05:46.749 --> 05:50.449
Well, yes, Detective MacDonald,
excellent suggestion.

05:50.449 --> 05:54.469
Detective, you know Fox, any idea
at all which rock he's crawled under?

05:54.469 --> 05:57.649
Oh, uh... Well, there was the hussy.

05:57.649 --> 06:03.709
The prostitute? I doubt he'd go
back to her after the way
she bungled his alibi on the stand.

06:03.709 --> 06:06.529
She claimed Fox was with her
when Mead was murdered

06:06.529 --> 06:07.989
but she had her times mixed up.

06:07.989 --> 06:12.529
And since Fox defended himself, he
didn't have the brains to fix that.

06:12.529 --> 06:17.649
Gentlemen, this woman's name?
Myrtle Smith.

06:20.629 --> 06:22.449
Myrtle Smith?

06:35.869 --> 06:36.949
Myrtle Smith?

06:37.509 --> 06:39.889
I didn't do nothing.

06:41.289 --> 06:42.749
I said, "I didn't!"

06:42.749 --> 06:46.009
Hey, watch the hands there,
Huckleberry.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.608
Miss Smith,
what were you doing in the trunk?

06:51.608 --> 06:55.628
I was hiding, of course,
in case Cecil come back again.

06:55.628 --> 06:58.828
Mr Fox was here? 
How long ago?

06:58.828 --> 07:04.388
A little bit ago. He came
barging in with that hole in his
neck, scared me half to death.

07:04.388 --> 07:06.928
I says, "Cecil,
why aren't you dead?"

07:06.928 --> 07:09.248
Well, he didn't like that.

07:09.248 --> 07:12.808
Sir, looks like Fox
was leaking quite a bit.

07:12.808 --> 07:17.028
Tried to clean himself up here.
Miss Smith, did you help
Mr Fox escape the noose?

07:17.028 --> 07:24.828
Me? Ha, I can work miracles
between the sheets, honey,
but that's asking a bit much.

07:24.828 --> 07:28.408
Did Mr Fox give any indication
as to where he might be going?

07:28.408 --> 07:31.728
The man's got a bunny's brain,
he's just running.

07:34.428 --> 07:37.828
(George, we'll post a constable
outside in case Mr Fox returns.)

07:37.828 --> 07:38.808
(Sir.)

07:46.468 --> 07:48.988
Thank you, Miss Smith. Good day.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.128
Theo! Theo?!

08:04.668 --> 08:07.488
Is it raining?
No, your front door was open.

08:07.488 --> 08:11.688
Oh! With you in a minute, Tommy boy.
How about a wee nip of gin?

08:11.688 --> 08:13.508
I'm sure there's ample supply.

08:13.508 --> 08:16.028
Mr Pleasant, I'm Detective Murdoch.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.808
I'd like you to have a seat please.

08:17.808 --> 08:19.348
HE SIGHS

08:23.488 --> 08:26.308
Mr Pleasant... I'll save
you the trouble, detective.

08:26.308 --> 08:28.328
No, I don't know what went wrong.

08:28.328 --> 08:31.048
Cecil Fox should be dead.

08:31.048 --> 08:32.948
Vexes me that he's not.

08:32.948 --> 08:34.748
Murdoch, allow me.

08:39.648 --> 08:42.727
You're the expert, Theo, speculate.

08:42.727 --> 08:45.648
Well, some men
are just hard to kill.

08:45.648 --> 08:51.288
But even if the man's neck was
the size of a bull's, I always
leave them hanging 10 minutes.

08:51.288 --> 08:53.468
He should have suffocated to death.

08:53.468 --> 08:58.008
Except that we think Fox shoved
a metal tube into his gullet
to enable him to breathe.

08:58.008 --> 09:00.328
Yes, isn't that interesting?

09:00.328 --> 09:04.428
My gut's in knots for days
before I have to hang them.

09:04.428 --> 09:08.608
But I treat everyone with dignity,
never a judgment.

09:08.608 --> 09:11.408
And after, they're just dead.

09:11.408 --> 09:14.448
But me? Well...

09:24.986 --> 09:27.426
Your friend is obviously
in some turmoil, sir.

09:28.566 --> 09:30.666
Theo was a good pal,
a good family man.

09:31.524 --> 09:35.404
He only took the job
because nobody else would
and it needed doing properly.

09:35.404 --> 09:40.284
A little while back, something
happened. A pint a day turned into...
Well, you saw for yourself.

09:40.284 --> 09:44.844
His wife had enough, left with
the daughters, went back to Halifax.

09:44.844 --> 09:51.424
Sir, I admire your loyalty to him
and I sympathise with his
situation, but...

09:51.424 --> 09:54.444
Murdoch, his reputation
is all he's got left.

09:54.444 --> 09:57.604
I just can't see him
involved in Fox's escape.

09:57.604 --> 09:59.804
What about this assistant, Catchpole?

10:06.484 --> 10:13.244
And that's what happens
if the drop is too long -
the noggin goes a-sailing.

10:15.304 --> 10:20.864
William, if Catchpole is a suspect,
why are you allowing him to give
this demonstration?

10:20.864 --> 10:23.444
Your expertise could be handy
if he puts a foot wrong.

10:23.444 --> 10:27.264
Well, all right,
but just being here is draining.

10:29.284 --> 10:31.844
Capital punishment
IS the will of the majority.

10:31.844 --> 10:36.044
Surely, William, you can't
support a law so prone to error?

10:36.044 --> 10:40.724
I have my qualms, Julia,
but I also have my duty to the law.

10:40.724 --> 10:45.944
Now, on the other hand,
too short a rope
and the client's neck don't pop.

10:45.944 --> 10:50.084
Then you just sit back and wait.
The more he fights,
the slower he goes.

10:50.084 --> 10:53.124
Kicking like mad, some of them.

10:53.124 --> 10:56.744
Mr Catchpole, I've perused
Marwood's table of drops.

10:56.744 --> 10:58.444
It's rigorously specific.

10:58.444 --> 11:02.164
Yes, sir, it lays it all out.
How far the prisoner has to drop,

11:02.164 --> 11:07.484
according to his/her weight
and physique, so the neck snaps
nice and neat.

11:07.484 --> 11:11.084
Did Mr Pleasant use Marwood's
calculations?

11:11.084 --> 11:17.604
Everything by the book, sir.
He weighed Fox the day before,
came in at 190lbs on the nose.

11:18.044 --> 11:22.144
Table of drops says
eight feet two inches for 190lbs,

11:22.144 --> 11:27.104
but Fox had a strong neck
so Mr Pleasant added eight inches

11:27.104 --> 11:28.204
to the drop length.

11:30.044 --> 11:31.744
8ft 10.

11:31.744 --> 11:34.084
Making it 8ft 10 inches.
8ft 10 inches.

11:35.704 --> 11:40.124
As always, Mr Pleasant hung sandbags
the same weight
as the prisoner for 12 hours.

11:43.624 --> 11:46.524
It takes the stretch
out of the rope.

11:46.524 --> 11:49.544
You don't want any recoil. No, sir,

11:49.544 --> 11:52.724
causes the client some grief.

11:52.724 --> 11:53.964
Client?

11:53.964 --> 11:58.944
Yes, ma'am, it shows
we respect the poor buggers.

11:58.944 --> 12:04.984
And lastly, he marked the 8ft 10
distance on the rope
with copper wires.

12:08.884 --> 12:13.184
Then, all is ready.

12:13.184 --> 12:16.824
Is this the rope Mr Pleasant
used to hang Mr Fox?

12:16.824 --> 12:20.524
Oh, no, sir. That would
be in execution box A.

12:20.524 --> 12:24.564
But only Mr Pleasant has the key.
Execution box A.

12:26.144 --> 12:28.184
Would be worth
some money now, I'd say.

12:38.844 --> 12:40.204
Dr...

12:49.684 --> 12:56.724
Copper wires marking the drop length
are exactly 8ft 10 inches.

12:56.724 --> 13:01.044
That's right. Mr Pleasant
says 8ft 10 drop, 8ft 10 it is.

13:01.044 --> 13:03.264
That means the drop length
was correct.

13:03.264 --> 13:04.984
Fox's neck should have snapped.

13:08.364 --> 13:09.444
Look at this, Dr.

13:13.664 --> 13:16.024
There's a fragment
of copper in the rope.

13:17.624 --> 13:21.024
Where one of the copper wires was
originally set to mark the length.

13:21.024 --> 13:24.844
Meaning the drop would have been...

13:28.264 --> 13:31.284
6ft. No broken neck.

13:31.284 --> 13:34.324
And the tracheotomy allows
him to survive the strangulation.

13:34.324 --> 13:38.564
That can't be right.
Only Mr Pleasant handles the rope.

13:38.564 --> 13:41.604
So that would mean Mr Pleasant...

13:41.604 --> 13:43.484
Let a killer go free.

13:43.484 --> 13:47.444
Why would I destroy my reputation
on a low-life like Cecil Fox?

13:47.444 --> 13:50.364
I don't know why you did it,
I only know you did.

13:50.364 --> 13:53.364
We found copper wire
at the 6ft mark on the rope.

13:55.284 --> 14:00.684
I'd have hoped you'd have let that
pass, Thomas, showed me the respect
that our friendship has earned.

14:00.684 --> 14:05.824
Yes, I spared his life.
And for one simple reason -

14:05.824 --> 14:08.084
Cecil Fox did not kill Judge Mead.

14:18.764 --> 14:25.984
Cecil Fox, lawfully
convicted of murder, is innocent
based on...your intuition?

14:25.984 --> 14:28.064
It's more than that.

14:28.064 --> 14:34.924
I could see it when
I was sizing him up for the drop.
It's in the eyes.

14:34.924 --> 14:38.104
You think I did it, but I didn't.

14:41.724 --> 14:44.984
Have you ever looked into
the eyes of the condemned,

14:44.984 --> 14:47.904
Detective, as I have,
in their final moments?

14:47.904 --> 14:52.364
No... Then wish you never do.

14:52.364 --> 14:57.224
I've put 155 men to death,
do you think I don't
know what the guilty look like?

14:57.224 --> 14:58.924
And the innocent?

14:58.924 --> 15:03.104
But how can you possibly expect
us to believe...?
Because it happened before.

15:03.104 --> 15:04.704
Before?

15:04.704 --> 15:09.064
A few months before.
A young man named Michael Workentin.

15:09.064 --> 15:10.764
Workentin.

15:11.884 --> 15:17.084
The young man who was hanged
for strangling his girlfriend.
That's the one, yes.

15:17.084 --> 15:22.184
That was the day, Thomas, that's
what I could never tell the missus.

15:22.184 --> 15:26.464
I didn't kill her. Please!

15:26.464 --> 15:29.364
You've got to believe me, sir,
I would never...

15:32.044 --> 15:37.004
I believed him, but I buried
it deep. I'm good at that.

15:37.004 --> 15:40.664
But, Theo, it was just a feeling.

15:40.664 --> 15:45.444
That's what I put it down to,
until a month later,
Freddy Duckworth was to be hanged.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.964
Duckworth was a foul scrag
to the bone.

15:47.964 --> 15:50.804
He cut an old woman to pieces.

15:54.984 --> 15:57.064
How does it feel to hang
an innocent man?

15:57.064 --> 16:00.484
That won't work with me, Freddy,
you're as guilty as Judas.

16:00.484 --> 16:04.444
I don't mean me, I mean
that Workentin boy you hanged.

16:06.164 --> 16:11.224
It was me who strangled his girl.
How's that feel, hangman?

16:13.824 --> 16:16.844
Now, at night,

16:16.844 --> 16:20.644
I see Michael Workentin standing on
the trap, begging for mercy,

16:20.644 --> 16:23.884
until I'm almost mad
with an unholy fear.

16:25.764 --> 16:28.864
It was the same feeling
with Cecil Fox.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.844
It was the same feeling I had
when I sent the Workentin lad off.

16:31.844 --> 16:35.764
I swore I would never
go through that again.

16:37.624 --> 16:39.084
So you plotted with Fox?

16:40.544 --> 16:44.824
I showed him how to use the tube
for his breathing.
I took care of the rope.

16:44.824 --> 16:47.124
After that, he was on his own.

16:49.564 --> 16:51.764
I've told you my secret now, Thomas.

16:53.084 --> 16:55.284
That earns us a drink, no?

17:06.964 --> 17:09.824
No wonder the man's all cracked up.

17:09.824 --> 17:12.384
He seems to genuinely
believe what he's saying.

17:12.384 --> 17:17.164
But the charges against him will
have to stand in the absence
of evidence exonerating Fox.

17:17.164 --> 17:19.763
In the absence of evidence.

17:21.723 --> 17:24.344
Sir, you aren't actually
considering?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.324
I can hear Dillard's voice now.

17:26.324 --> 17:32.044
You want to re-open the Mead case
because the sozzled hangman
is a mind reader?! Sir!

17:32.044 --> 17:33.724
And you agreed, Murdoch?

17:33.724 --> 17:36.204
I remain open to the possibility.

17:36.204 --> 17:41.544
Gentleman, I prosecuted Cecil Fox,
I had no doubt of his guilt. The
trial judge and jury had no doubt.

17:41.544 --> 17:45.384
True, but...
Let's start with Fox's alibi

17:45.384 --> 17:48.124
that he was with Myrtle Smith,
her testimony was so confused

17:48.124 --> 17:51.144
it sealed Fox's fate
rather than exonerate him.

17:51.144 --> 17:52.844
Motive -

17:52.844 --> 17:57.964
the six years that Fox spent at hard
labour, thanks to Judge Enoch Mead.

17:57.964 --> 17:59.644
Admittedly, we've got little...

17:59.644 --> 18:01.864
Opportunity -

18:01.864 --> 18:05.784
Cecil Fox was seen at the courthouse
on the day Judge Mead was killed.

18:05.784 --> 18:08.404
And several people
heard a loud argument.

18:08.404 --> 18:09.984
Between Fox and the judge?

18:09.984 --> 18:14.124
Yeah. The jury didn't need much help
to draw their own conclusions there.

18:14.124 --> 18:16.444
Conclusions you made for them.

18:16.444 --> 18:18.204
That's my job.

18:18.204 --> 18:22.584
Inspector Brackenreid...

18:22.584 --> 18:30.604
I suggest you put your friendship
with the hangman aside and start
behaving professionally.

18:30.604 --> 18:32.964
Enoch Mead was
murdered by Cecil Fox.

18:32.964 --> 18:36.864
I vowed to put my friend's killer
to the noose, and that's what I did.

18:36.864 --> 18:40.844
The case is closed.
Of course. You're right.

18:40.844 --> 18:42.924
Good.

18:42.924 --> 18:46.644
Well, I'll begin preparing
the charges against Mr Pleasant.

18:46.644 --> 18:51.364
And, please, find Cecil Fox.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.604
Gentlemen.

18:58.624 --> 19:01.324
Still want me
to re-open the Mead case?

19:01.324 --> 19:02.804
What do you think?

19:15.138 --> 19:16.658
Higgins, you in there?

19:20.418 --> 19:23.418
Come on in, George.

19:23.418 --> 19:25.098
Hot tea and doughnuts.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.718
Bless you, my good man.

19:28.338 --> 19:30.258
Any sign of Fox?

19:30.258 --> 19:33.378
Long and boring watch, I'm afraid.

19:33.378 --> 19:35.298
Got me thinking about
being executed.

19:35.298 --> 19:37.478
Oh, you must be bored!

19:37.478 --> 19:42.058
No, what would it be like
to know that your life is going to
end at a certain point, you know?

19:43.618 --> 19:45.998
I think I'd like to
go suddenly without knowing.

19:45.998 --> 19:49.618
Like my Aunt Begonia,
she died laughing. Quite literally.

19:49.618 --> 19:52.898
My Uncle Calvert fell off a
milking stool and she died laughing.

19:52.898 --> 19:54.978
I guess she went happy, then.

19:54.978 --> 19:57.318
I suppose so.

19:57.318 --> 20:00.958
I think I'd go happy if I died
choking on one of these doughnuts.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.078
They're so good.

20:03.078 --> 20:06.698
Did you know a cow
invented the doughnut? Go on.

20:06.698 --> 20:10.238
Some old Bessie
knocked over a vat of boiling oil,

20:10.238 --> 20:13.738
there was a glob of pastry there,
and the doughnut was born.

20:13.738 --> 20:14.818
Really?

20:14.818 --> 20:16.938
Yes, Higgins, really.

20:16.938 --> 20:19.258
Where did you hear this?
You are such a sceptic.

20:19.258 --> 20:22.098
It's common knowledge
that a cow invented the doughnut!

20:24.478 --> 20:26.538
I'll see you later.

20:31.538 --> 20:34.278
Actually, it may have been a goat.

20:34.278 --> 20:35.838
I'm quite sure it was a goat.

20:35.838 --> 20:37.138
Ah.

20:38.218 --> 20:41.898
Mead took his usual route home
from the courthouse that night.

20:41.898 --> 20:46.978
Cut through a laneway off
King Street, and that's where
Fox caught up and did him in.

20:46.978 --> 20:51.538
You found no witnesses?
Can't find witnesses
if there aren't any witnesses.

20:51.538 --> 20:53.138
I'll make a note of that.

20:54.718 --> 20:56.538
Are you trying to get me going?

20:56.538 --> 21:00.178
I'm doing my best to co-operate here.
I brought you my files, didn't I?

21:00.178 --> 21:01.518
And I appreciate it.

21:01.518 --> 21:04.618
Well, I don't. It feels like
people are doubting my work.

21:04.618 --> 21:06.878
I don't care for that.

21:06.878 --> 21:13.978
It says here that Fox claims Judge
Mead sent him a note to meet him
the day that Judge Mead died.

21:13.978 --> 21:15.978
The famous note, yeah.

21:15.978 --> 21:19.898
Fox tried to say Mead asked him down
there, but the note didn't say why.

21:19.898 --> 21:24.578
Fox didn't go down there
to threaten Mead for six years'
hard labour. Oh, no.

21:24.578 --> 21:28.078
Where is this note?
There is no note.

21:28.078 --> 21:31.398
Look, Fox went down
to the courthouse on his own

21:31.398 --> 21:34.798
because he had a bee in his bonnet
about Mead, can't you see that?

21:34.798 --> 21:38.798
So, Fox admitted
to meeting with the judge
the day the judge was murdered?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.798
No! He said when he got
there the judge had left!

21:41.798 --> 21:44.178
Wouldn't you know!

21:44.178 --> 21:47.798
And the postmortem?
Single stab wound to the heart.

21:47.798 --> 21:52.378
Old Doc Philpot did the exam.
Francis Philpot? Isn't he retired?

21:52.378 --> 21:54.078
He still likes to dabble in it.

21:54.078 --> 21:57.178
It must be nice to be able to dabble.

21:57.178 --> 22:02.778
Indeed. Perhaps we should have
the judge's body exhumed
and re-examined by Dr Ogden.

22:02.778 --> 22:04.978
Suit yourself, Murdoch.

22:06.898 --> 22:08.938
Fox was your only suspect.

22:08.938 --> 22:11.718
The only one that mattered,
since we knew we had our man.

22:11.718 --> 22:13.938
Yes, but...
There was another fellow

22:13.938 --> 22:17.678
who wrote the judge some mouthy
letters after his son was hanged.

22:17.678 --> 22:20.978
This other fellow -
what was his name?

22:20.978 --> 22:22.558
Oh, um, Workentin.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.778
Joe Workentin.

22:24.778 --> 22:31.198
Mr Workentin, is it true you sent
Judge Mead threatening letters
after your son was executed?

22:32.978 --> 22:35.258
Yeah.

22:35.258 --> 22:39.118
Is it because Judge Mead
sentenced your son to hang?

22:39.118 --> 22:46.078
No. Because Mead seemed bound
and determined to do it,
evidence be damned. What do you mean?

22:47.658 --> 22:51.918
Michael was never anywhere near
his girl's house that night.

22:51.918 --> 22:57.978
But on the last day of the trial,
all of a sudden, there's this
new witness, out of nowhere.

22:57.978 --> 23:01.838
She said she saw Michael
fight with his girl.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.858
Put his hands around her throat.

23:04.858 --> 23:09.438
I see. A last-minute eyewitness
with damning evidence is suspicious.

23:09.438 --> 23:12.878
That's what Michael's lawyer argued.

23:12.878 --> 23:16.658
But Judge Mead let
her testimony stand.

23:16.658 --> 23:20.218
That lady was lying
through her teeth.

23:20.218 --> 23:22.818
Do you recall her name?

23:22.818 --> 23:26.238
Yeah. Agatha Meldrum.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.718
And, Mr Workentin, where were you
the night Judge Mead was murdered?
Me?

23:33.838 --> 23:37.658
I was on duty
at Fire Hall Number Three.

23:48.698 --> 23:51.438
KNOCKING

23:51.438 --> 23:55.538
Higgins! For the love of God,
you scared me half to death.

24:03.258 --> 24:04.698
GENTLE MUSIC PLAYS

24:14.478 --> 24:18.258
Well, Judge Mead,
a month in the ground hasn't done
your health a weight of good.

24:20.338 --> 24:22.658
You're not going to jump up
and grab me, are you?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.938
Oh, bloody hell.

24:35.938 --> 24:37.418
Murdoch!

24:44.858 --> 24:49.458
I got a call from Detective
MacDonald. Apparently you're looking
into another one of my cases.

24:49.458 --> 24:51.418
Sir? The Workentin case.

24:51.418 --> 24:56.398
Oh! Actually, we were simply
confirming Joe Workentin's
alibi in Judge Mead's murder.

24:56.398 --> 24:59.338
Now that you mention that case,
Mr Dillard, we had a chat

24:59.338 --> 25:02.878
with Joe Workentin, and he insists
that his son was railroaded.

25:02.878 --> 25:04.578
Rubbish.

25:04.578 --> 25:08.658
Your case against Michael Workentin
was going badly, until,
in the 11th hour,

25:08.658 --> 25:12.498
you found an eyewitness who swore
she saw Michael kill his girlfriend.

25:12.498 --> 25:15.718
Lucky break? Due diligence.

25:15.718 --> 25:20.878
Agatha Meldrum was a reluctant
witness, it took some persuasion
to get her to come forward at all.

25:20.878 --> 25:25.258
What are you playing at? Grounds
for appeal in the Fox verdict?
We are just being thorough.

25:25.258 --> 25:30.738
By suggesting that I sent,
not one, but two innocent men
to the gallows? My God.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.118
I stand by my record, gentleman,

25:33.118 --> 25:35.938
I'm prepared
to defend my reputation,

25:35.938 --> 25:37.978
even at the expense of yours.

25:42.358 --> 25:44.418
That was interesting. Indeed.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.258
What in the world?

25:57.778 --> 26:00.098
Crabtree!
Where's your bloody trousers?!

26:00.098 --> 26:01.858
Cecil Fox stole my uniform, sir.

26:01.858 --> 26:04.058
I'm afraid he caught me off guard.

26:04.058 --> 26:05.978
Higgins found me unconscious.

26:05.978 --> 26:09.018
Did he give you any indication as
to where he might be headed?

26:09.018 --> 26:10.118
No, sir.

26:10.118 --> 26:15.218
Well, Inspector,
you still think Fox is innocent?

26:15.218 --> 26:17.358
Put the word out
to the other station houses.

26:17.358 --> 26:21.118
Sir. You lot, stop
gawping and move your arses.

26:21.118 --> 26:24.178
George, are you all right? No, sir.

26:24.178 --> 26:26.418
When he took my trousers,
he took my dignity.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.238
And my knees have taken a chill...

26:28.238 --> 26:32.678
George, please go and
fetch another uniform.
Fox may still be in the vicinity.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.138
Sir.

26:35.878 --> 26:40.378
Sir, why would
Fox need a police uniform? Sir?

26:41.778 --> 26:43.938
Dillard was right, Murdoch.

26:43.938 --> 26:47.978
Fox is as guilty as hell
and Theo's just...pathetic.

27:02.278 --> 27:03.998
Mr Fox!

27:10.421 --> 27:12.701
Is that the last of the doors? 
Yes.

27:12.701 --> 27:14.761
You try to scream and I'll kill you.

27:14.761 --> 27:17.461
You're choking me!
Don't talk to me about choking.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.441
I won't try to escape.

27:19.441 --> 27:22.201
You need my help. I can't help
you if you don't let me go.

27:22.201 --> 27:24.581
You think I believe a word you say?

27:24.581 --> 27:27.381
Is that who I think it is?

27:27.381 --> 27:29.921
Judge Mead, yes,
I believe you've met.

27:29.921 --> 27:32.001
I didn't kill him.

27:32.001 --> 27:34.521
I just meant
when he sentenced you to hard labour.

27:36.827 --> 27:37.867
Why's he here?

27:37.867 --> 27:42.807
Apparently, the police
have doubts concerning your guilt.

27:42.807 --> 27:47.227
Don't try to trick me,
Doc, just fix me up.

27:55.127 --> 27:56.587
George.

27:58.887 --> 28:00.907
Sir.

28:04.107 --> 28:05.787
Where did you get your uniform?

28:05.787 --> 28:09.627
I borrowed it from Tiny Malone. Why?

28:13.227 --> 28:20.207
If Fox is simply running,
as Myrtle Smith said,
then why is he still in Toronto?

28:20.207 --> 28:23.567
Well, sir, I was thinking, he needed
to have that wound tended to.

28:23.567 --> 28:25.907
But then we're covering
all the hospitals.

28:25.907 --> 28:30.507
I also wondered, in order to fund
his escape from the city, Cecil Fox

28:30.507 --> 28:37.167
stole my uniform as a disguise,
in order to launch a series of daring
daylight bank robberies.

28:38.787 --> 28:43.987
That's an interesting notion,
George, but wouldn't a police
uniform attract more attention?

28:46.427 --> 28:50.147
Well,
maybe he just wants to stroll on in
here and have lunch with the boys.

28:52.567 --> 28:54.607
You could be right, George.

28:54.607 --> 28:59.547
In that uniform, Cecil Fox could
blend in near a police station.

28:59.547 --> 29:04.067
This station happens to be across
the street from a certain
doctor Fox knows.

29:09.367 --> 29:11.747
This thing hurts something awful.

29:13.187 --> 29:15.867
There is a serious infection.
You need...
PHONE RINGS

29:15.867 --> 29:17.827
Don't answer it.

29:17.827 --> 29:21.067
But... All right.

29:25.987 --> 29:27.807
You need to get to the hospital.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.567
Coppers are watching the hospitals.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.487
Well, as you wish.

29:31.487 --> 29:33.007
Remove your jacket and shirt.

29:35.947 --> 29:39.927
Are you all right? Tore up my
right shoulder doing hard labour.

29:39.927 --> 29:42.107
Been like this for a long time.

29:42.107 --> 29:45.927
Really? Relax.

29:51.067 --> 29:52.107
BONES CRACK

29:52.107 --> 29:54.647
What the hell?!
You do that again and I'll...

29:54.647 --> 29:56.927
Kill me, yes, I know.
BANGING ON DOOR

29:56.927 --> 29:58.587
Julia! Are you all right?

29:58.587 --> 30:00.767
Open the door!

30:03.787 --> 30:06.467
Come any closer and I'll stick her.

30:06.467 --> 30:09.867
Mr Fox, let her go.
We mean you no harm.

30:09.867 --> 30:13.107
Right. You'll just bring me back
to the gallows. No harm there.

30:13.107 --> 30:19.587
Mr Fox, I must insist.
No, everyone be quiet. I've
examined the judge's knife wound.

30:19.587 --> 30:23.387
The angle of the entry conclusively
indicates that he was stabbed

30:23.387 --> 30:26.967
with an over-the-shoulder
descending motion
and that the killer was right-handed.

30:26.967 --> 30:30.707
But I'm right-handed. For goodness
sake, whose side are you on?!

30:30.707 --> 30:32.107
Raise your right arm.

30:32.107 --> 30:35.727
I can't. That's the point.

30:35.727 --> 30:40.827
His right shoulder is quite
immobile, and judging by my
examination, has been for months.

30:40.827 --> 30:46.307
Meaning that Mr Fox was sentenced
to death and hanged for a crime
he could not have committed.

30:52.547 --> 30:59.407
Well, obviously, a grave miscarriage
of justice has been averted.

30:59.407 --> 31:01.847
Thanks to you both.

31:01.847 --> 31:06.047
Had I had the benefit
of Dr Ogden's expertise...

31:06.047 --> 31:09.427
The blame rests with Dr Philpot's
shoddy postmortem, does it?

31:09.427 --> 31:14.267
And with Myrtle Smith's misguided
attempts to provide Fox with an
alibi, they seemed a certain lie.

31:14.267 --> 31:20.467
Throw in Fox's history of violent
crime and...what was I to think?

31:20.467 --> 31:22.007
So what of Theodore Pleasant?

31:22.007 --> 31:26.507
I regret that he will be relieved
of his duties, for obvious reasons.

31:26.507 --> 31:28.767
But release him,
I'll drop the charges.

31:28.767 --> 31:32.207
The obvious question now is,
who did kill Judge Mead?

31:32.207 --> 31:34.867
Yes, that's your priority.

31:36.927 --> 31:41.827
I'm afraid this case was bungled
from the beginning.

31:41.827 --> 31:45.027
We were so sure about Fox.

31:45.027 --> 31:49.307
Perhaps if we'd taken more time,
properly collected evidence...

31:49.307 --> 31:53.167
I trust you will revisit all that,
Detective? Why, yes, of course.

31:53.167 --> 32:00.047
Well, good. Fox is being treated
at St Mike's, is he not? Yes, sir.

32:00.047 --> 32:01.967
I owe him an apology.

32:01.967 --> 32:08.707
And...tell Mr Pleasant I'll pay
him a visit when he gets home.

32:08.707 --> 32:10.607
Gentlemen.

32:14.707 --> 32:17.827
I'll have the men do
a thorough evidence sweep
of the judge's office.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.967
What the hell is that, Murdoch?

32:25.967 --> 32:29.007
Sir, are you familiar with
Symbolic Logic by John Venn?

32:29.007 --> 32:32.347
What do you think? Right.

32:32.347 --> 32:36.727
The idea is that connections between
two or more groups of things

32:36.727 --> 32:39.427
can be represented by
the overlapping portion

32:39.427 --> 32:41.027
of the diagram in the centre.

32:41.027 --> 32:43.927
Never mind all this symbolics
logic, what are you doing?

32:43.927 --> 32:47.987
I'm looking for a connection between
the Workentin and Fox cases.

32:47.987 --> 32:51.587
If there is another suspect
in Judge Mead's murder,

32:51.587 --> 32:54.327
perhaps he or she
is hiding in that area.

32:54.327 --> 32:57.667
Right, well. Here's the evidence
that Detective MacDonald

32:57.667 --> 33:00.387
originally collected
from Judge Mead's office.

33:00.387 --> 33:02.827
Perhaps that will help.

33:06.627 --> 33:12.547
No notation of fingermarks,
no hair or fibre samples. No notes.

33:12.547 --> 33:15.027
Single malt Craigleith - pricey.

33:16.527 --> 33:17.987
Judge's appointment book.

33:19.787 --> 33:22.807
Oh! What? His last days.

33:22.807 --> 33:27.667
The judge had an appointment
at 8am at The Lion,
two days before he died.

33:27.667 --> 33:31.507
The Lion is a bucket of blood
on Church Street.
What would a judge be doing there?

33:31.507 --> 33:35.747
Detective, we went through
Judge Mead's office again,
as per your request.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.147
In case MacDonald missed anything.

33:38.147 --> 33:45.787
Which it seems he had done. We found
hair and fibre samples, finger
marks on the Judge's guest chair,

33:45.787 --> 33:51.567
various detritus, but most peculiar,
sir, we found this piece of glass.

33:53.147 --> 33:56.067
We found it wedged
in the wall by the bookshelf.

33:58.007 --> 34:00.187
The lettering is familiar.

34:06.127 --> 34:10.607
George, I need you to get to
Mr Pleasant's home before he does.

34:10.607 --> 34:13.007
Sir, we may have a problem.

34:13.560 --> 34:17.120
This is the shard of glass recovered
from Judge Mead's chambers.

34:17.120 --> 34:21.699
This is a bottle
of Blue Cat gin George retrieved
from Mr Pleasant's home.

34:21.699 --> 34:23.440
Where are you going with this?

34:23.440 --> 34:29.280
Sir, you saw yourself, Judge Mead
preferred fine single malt whisky,
not cheap gin.

34:30.840 --> 34:34.300
This is a fingermark recovered
from that shard of glass

34:34.300 --> 34:36.639
from Judge Mead's chambers.

34:36.639 --> 34:42.460
The second fingermark was retrieved
from the Blue Cat gin bottle
from Mr Pleasant's home.

34:42.460 --> 34:46.719
It belongs to Theodore Pleasant.
Bloody hell.

34:46.719 --> 34:50.460
It was Theo that was in chambers
arguing with Mead the day he died.

34:50.460 --> 34:53.840
A fact Mr Pleasant
chose not to divulge.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.580
He said he looked in Fox's eyes
and knew he was innocent.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.440
Something I never
fully accepted, sir.

34:59.440 --> 35:04.340
I believe that Mr Pleasant did
know that Mr Fox was innocent,

35:04.340 --> 35:07.040
but because Mr Pleasant
murdered Judge Mead.

35:11.880 --> 35:12.920
KNOCKING

35:12.920 --> 35:16.120
Mr Pleasant. Come on in.

35:19.260 --> 35:21.220
You're just in time.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.080
Put it down, Theo.
We have some questions.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.720
Questions? Yes.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.960
Why did you not let on you had
an argument with Judge Mead?

35:35.600 --> 35:39.080
If I'd said I went down
there in a drunken rage,
what would you have thought?

35:39.080 --> 35:41.880
The same thing you're thinking now!

35:41.880 --> 35:44.320
Mr Pleasant,
did you kill Judge Mead? I did not.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.540
I believe you did. You went
down there and confronted him...

35:47.540 --> 35:52.380
To tell him that Freddie Duckworth
confessed to the murder that
the Workentin lad had hanged for.

35:52.380 --> 35:57.360
That he'd sentenced an innocent man
to die and obliged me to kill him.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.080
I needed him to hear that.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.900
But he didn't seem to care.

36:00.900 --> 36:04.400
We got into it.
I suppose I threw my bottle at him.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.040
Bloody hell, Theo,
don't shrug it off.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.740
You had a violent row with
a man the day he died. The day?

36:10.740 --> 36:13.800
No, it was a week before.
Not the day.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.880
I didn't kill him, Thomas.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.720
Murdoch...

36:26.120 --> 36:30.940
If he had it out with Mead
a week before the murder,
then something's not right.

36:30.940 --> 36:34.420
He has lied to us before.
I'm just saying, "think", Murdoch.

36:34.420 --> 36:38.520
If that wasn't Theo in Mead's
office the day of the murder,
who could it have been?

36:38.520 --> 36:40.680
Who's left?

36:40.680 --> 36:44.520
Perhaps whomever the judge
met with at The Lion two
days prior to his death.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.460
That has to be it.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.360
I'm telling you,
Theodore Pleasant is no murderer.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.080
'Well?'

36:56.080 --> 36:58.360
It would seem The Lion isn't open
until noon,

36:58.360 --> 37:04.100
but the innkeeper does recall
the judge being there at night,
around 8pm, and with a woman.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.860
The judge's tart? Apparently not.

37:05.860 --> 37:08.740
The innkeeper seemed to think
they didn't know each other,

37:08.740 --> 37:11.240
but that they had strong words
before she left.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.840
Who was she? He didn't know.

37:13.840 --> 37:21.240
So, why would Judge Mead
write 8am, if The Lion
wasn't open at that time?

37:23.480 --> 37:26.940
Oh. I should have seen this.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.320
Sir, the comma after the hour.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.240
"AM" isn't a reference to the time.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.000
It's someone's... Initials.

37:35.580 --> 37:39.680
Agatha Meldrum. The last-minute
eyewitness in the Workentin case.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.260
Judge Mead met with Agatha
a few days after Pleasant
confronted him.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.800
Perhaps he believed the
Workentin boy was innocent.

37:45.800 --> 37:50.920
So he questioned her about her
testimony that she saw Michael
Workentin strangle his girlfriend.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.460
He must not have liked what
he heard, otherwise
they wouldn't have fought.

37:54.460 --> 37:58.080
Perhaps the judge had second
thoughts about her testimony.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.440
The transcripts
would be illuminating.

38:02.059 --> 38:04.199
We're bringing in
Miss Meldrum for a chat.

38:06.979 --> 38:12.779
Detective, Agatha Meldrum
moved out of her flat the day
after she met with Judge Mead.

38:12.779 --> 38:15.899
She's left no forwarding address.
Hmm.

38:15.899 --> 38:17.719
What's that, sir?

38:17.719 --> 38:21.759
A transcript of Agatha Meldrum's
testimony in the Workentin trial.

38:21.759 --> 38:24.299
George,
what did Myrtle Smith call you?

38:24.299 --> 38:26.779
Oh, yes, most unique it was.

38:26.779 --> 38:30.919
Quite a low term, slang for
somebody of little consequence.

38:30.919 --> 38:33.519
Demeaning, really.
It was "Huckleberry".

38:36.359 --> 38:37.679
Have a look.

38:37.679 --> 38:41.579
Hey, watch
the hands there, Huckleberry!

38:41.579 --> 38:43.659
Come on now, Huckleberry.

38:43.659 --> 38:46.899
That's the Huckleberry I saw
strangling that poor girl.

38:46.899 --> 38:53.039
Michael Workentin. Alas, Agatha
and Myrtle are the same person.

38:53.039 --> 38:56.859
As I understand it,
Agatha Meldrum has left town.

38:56.859 --> 39:00.199
And Myrtle Smith is not Agatha.

39:01.979 --> 39:04.019
Now, I have appointments.

39:07.259 --> 39:11.579
Myrtle Smith is a woman of
dubious character, to be sure.

39:11.579 --> 39:17.699
The last nine times she was
arrested for various crimes,
your office dropped all charges.

39:17.699 --> 39:20.379
For lack of evidence. Nine times?!

39:20.379 --> 39:23.299
She's beholden to you, isn't she?

39:23.299 --> 39:24.839
To do your bidding.

39:24.839 --> 39:26.959
One time she's Myrtle Smith.

39:26.959 --> 39:30.819
The next she's Agatha Meldrum, or
whoever you need her to be in court.

39:30.819 --> 39:33.539
A witness in your employ.
Whatever gets a conviction.

39:37.488 --> 39:42.248
You knowingly sent two innocent
men to die on the gallows.
I did no such thing.

39:42.248 --> 39:45.828
Your case against Michael Workentin
was falling apart.

39:45.828 --> 39:50.668
So you brought in Myrtle Smith,
who claimed to be eyewitness
Agatha Meldrum.

39:50.668 --> 39:54.568
Her testimony doomed
Michael Workentin to hang for
a murder he did not commit.

39:54.568 --> 39:56.928
So far, so good.

39:56.928 --> 40:02.648
Until another condemned man, Freddie
Duckworth, confessed to the murder
that Michael Workentin hanged for.

40:02.648 --> 40:04.228
Pleasant tells Mead.

40:04.228 --> 40:06.388
Mead confronts Agatha Meldrum.

40:06.388 --> 40:09.148
And then she tells you
the judge is onto your scheme.

40:09.148 --> 40:11.128
Not so.
So now there's only one option.

40:11.128 --> 40:13.688
Judge Mead has to die
before he exposes you.

40:13.688 --> 40:17.448
And now you're accusing me of
murder as well? That's delusional.

40:17.448 --> 40:20.088
Sit down!

40:20.088 --> 40:23.968
Your first step
was to frame Cecil Fox.

40:23.968 --> 40:30.968
So you had Myrtle Smith meet him,
seduce him and provide him with
an unreliable alibi to sink him.

40:30.968 --> 40:35.008
You also needed Fox to be seen
on the same day that
you planned to kill Mead.

40:35.008 --> 40:40.988
So you forged a note from Judge Mead
to lure Fox down to the courthouse
to be seen by witnesses.

40:40.988 --> 40:43.908
You were sure to have a row
with the judge,

40:43.908 --> 40:46.408
so a loud argument was overheard.

40:46.408 --> 40:50.448
You tell Myrtle Smith to
destroy the note so that
Fox sounds crazy at trial.

40:50.448 --> 40:56.348
And that was supposed to be that,
until Dr Ogden's findings
confirmed Fox was innocent.

40:56.348 --> 40:58.588
You panicked.

40:58.588 --> 41:04.208
So you planted evidence against
Pleasant in Judge Mead's chambers.

41:04.208 --> 41:07.988
You were going to let
Pleasant hang for your crime.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.968
Are you done with this fantasy?

41:12.968 --> 41:18.368
And do you realise how thoroughly
I'm going to ruin you both for this?

41:31.528 --> 41:34.368
What's this?
My man found it in your garbage.

41:34.368 --> 41:37.948
It has your fingermarks on it.
So we glued it back together.

41:37.948 --> 41:40.988
It's all there,
except for one piece.

41:40.988 --> 41:42.708
That also bears your fingermark.

41:42.708 --> 41:45.748
The piece you planted
in Judge Mead's chambers.

41:51.688 --> 41:54.788
The justice system
must protect society.

41:56.408 --> 42:01.788
But time and again it fails to keep
dangerous criminals off the street.
I've had enough.

42:01.788 --> 42:04.908
This nonsense was going to stop
with the Workentin boy.

42:04.908 --> 42:08.868
But...Judge Mead was weak.

42:11.528 --> 42:13.568
I did what I did

42:13.568 --> 42:16.448
in sacrifice for the greater good.

42:18.488 --> 42:20.128
You see that, don't you?

42:36.928 --> 42:42.628
I'll take good care.
I promise that death
will be swift and without pain.

43:14.146 --> 43:15.126
Come on in.

43:19.766 --> 43:23.726
Theo. What's become of you?
A new leaf?

43:23.726 --> 43:25.826
Ah! Hello, Thomas.

43:25.826 --> 43:27.506
Well, what do you think?

43:27.506 --> 43:31.826
And me - three weeks, not a drop.
Really? And you're feeling better?

43:31.826 --> 43:33.646
No, much worse, actually!

43:33.646 --> 43:35.306
But it's a start.

43:37.186 --> 43:38.746
Dillard was hanged today.

43:43.952 --> 43:47.832
Hanging is a miserable
business, Thomas.

43:47.832 --> 43:49.552
The condemned die only once,

43:49.552 --> 43:51.952
the executioner dies every time.

43:51.952 --> 43:53.672
Poor Catchpole.

43:53.672 --> 43:57.332
Well, you don't have to worry about
that any more. It never leaves you.

43:57.332 --> 43:59.052
But I did the job, didn't I?

43:59.052 --> 44:01.432
Not one of them suffered.
You can be proud of that.

44:01.432 --> 44:03.792
Well...

44:09.015 --> 44:11.315
Julia.

44:11.315 --> 44:15.255
I just performed the postmortem
on Crown Prosecutor Dillard.

44:15.255 --> 44:17.375
All is well?

44:17.375 --> 44:20.735
No, William.
Gideon Catchpole botched the hanging.

44:20.735 --> 44:23.335
The drop was too long. Oh.

44:25.935 --> 44:28.375
Do you ever question
your calling, William?

44:29.955 --> 44:31.535
What we have to do every day?

44:34.275 --> 44:38.295
Well, I admit, sometimes
there is a price to be paid.

44:38.295 --> 44:42.435
But we must accept it. Really?

44:42.435 --> 44:43.895
Must we?
