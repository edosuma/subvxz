Did we leave you at the restaurant?

That's right, Ramona.

This bear is still living
in a bubble of denial

and we only talk about happy things,

02:40.618 --> 02:44.122

so it looks like we're leaving.

Luckily, I set an alarm
on my phone for midnight

on our wedding day.

No, no, no, no, this can't be happening
on our wedding day!

04:32.897 --> 04:33.731
Let us in!

04:33.815 --> 04:36.484
Ladies, I need you to step away.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.238
This venue is government property 
on account of money laundering,

04:40.363 --> 04:43.116
tax evasion, and terrible chicken Kiev.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.662
Can't you seize this tomorrow?

04:47.745 --> 04:49.664
We're getting married today.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.291

04:59.966 --> 05:03.886

-Thank you, my brother.
-Yep.

I can't believe two of my daughters
are getting married today.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.363
We are so old.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.783
Hey, speak for yourself. I'm still wearing
the same jeans I wore in middle school.

That Mr. Jordache made a quality product.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.041
I am so proud of the way
those girls came together for each other,

05:33.124 --> 05:36.461
just like we did. 
Now, they're moving on, just like we did.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.797
The most important thing is
we did a good job raising those girls.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.842
Yep, we raised confident,
resourceful women.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.844
Who still live in this house rent-free.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.596
You lived in this house rent-free.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.848
That's because I'm a confident,
resourceful woman.

I gotta get my haircut from Alejandro.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.950
Or DEFCON one.
Whatever DEFCON is worse.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.454
Deej, what's wrong?
Why are we at DEFCON one or four?

06:12.038 --> 06:15.458
The government seized the venue.
There's nowhere to have the wedding.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.293
Oh, that's definitely DEFCON one.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.087
I've read a ton of books
about the Cold War.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.588
[Jimmy] Oh, no!

06:22.215 --> 06:23.674
Jimmy,? What are you doing?

06:23.758 --> 06:25.760
I'm making sure I don't look at you again.

06:25.843 --> 06:29.430
I obviously triggered a curse
by seeing you after midnight.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.890
Is everything okay?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.683
Jimmy didn't trigger a curse, did he?

06:34.018 --> 06:36.229
No, there's no curse.

06:36.312 --> 06:39.649
It's just that, you know,
moments after Jimmy saw me after midnight,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.318
a hundred-year-old wedding venue
got seized by the government

06:42.402 --> 06:43.611
in a very curse-like fashion.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.989
I have an idea.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.451
I know you all think I'm corny
and overly sentimental--

06:50.535 --> 06:51.494
[all] Yes.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.581
But all along, I have secretly wondered

06:55.790 --> 06:58.709
why we weren't having the ceremony
in our own backyard.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.922
I mean, maybe this isn't a curse. 
Maybe it's a sign.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.133
What, that you were right all along?

07:05.800 --> 07:06.634
Well, yes.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.929
We've had our greatest memories here.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.806
And now,

07:11.889 --> 07:14.517
we are gonna have
the greatest one of all,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.894
because we are gonna get married 
right here.

07:17.687 --> 07:21.065
Okay, maybe not right here,
but right there in the backyard.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.402
Yes! That is going to be so much cheaper.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.280
I mean, so much more meaningful.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.491
Okay, people, all hands on deck.

and flowers.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.957

Oh. That's so much better than us.

Don't worry, I'm gonna find us
another officiant.

have the perfect wedding.

why can't we just officiate the wedding?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.398
Because we have to walk the ladies
down the aisle.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.109
And remember what happened
the last time you officiated a wedding?

08:47.193 --> 08:50.821
Well, yeah, the bride ran away
and they ended up not getting married.

08:50.905 --> 08:51.739
Oh.

the perfect person to lead this ceremony.

to officiate the wedding?

the best day of our lives

27:05.165 --> 27:07.250
with the most important people
in the world.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.837
We should probably find our husbands.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.174
-Oh, yeah.
-Those guys, yeah.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.343
[Stephanie] Hmm.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.733
Wow, it's empty in here.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.654
I guess this is really happening.

27:37.781 --> 27:38.657
Yeah.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.035
It's so weird.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.001
I know this is probably an odd time
to bring this up,

27:51.544 --> 27:53.004
but you owe me seven dollars.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.510
Sorry, I'm uncomfortable with emotion.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.597
I'm gonna miss you guys.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.808
We're gonna miss you, too.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.185
We love you, Ramona.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.314
I love you guys, too.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.155
You know, when I first moved in here,

28:19.781 --> 28:21.700
I thought these group hugs
were nauseating.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.997
But now, they're the thing
I'm gonna miss the most.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.794
Well, I'll help you with your stuff.

28:40.593 --> 28:41.428
And...

28:42.178 --> 28:44.139
you can just Venmo me
the seven dollars.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.272
Ramona, you ready?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.942
To leave? No.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.362
But I have everything out of my room.

29:00.196 --> 29:02.407
Yep, we're all packed, too.

29:04.409 --> 29:07.746
Well, I've been trying to avoid
this moment for a long time, but...

29:08.997 --> 29:11.499
I guess there's no hiding from it
any longer.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.796
When you guys came here five years ago,

29:18.298 --> 29:20.091
I was at my lowest point.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.720
I honestly wasn't sure how to keep going.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.349
But you taught me how to live again...

29:29.851 --> 29:31.227
and how to love again.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.317
And now, thanks to all of you, I...

29:38.443 --> 29:41.780
I finally have the strength
to set you free...

29:43.323 --> 29:46.201
and let you live your own lives
with your own families.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.623
But I just have to say that...

29:53.500 --> 29:56.085
you people are my everything.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.004
[sniffles]

29:58.338 --> 30:02.300
And it would take me a thousand lives
to repay you for the love and the kindness

30:02.425 --> 30:04.552
that you showed me and my boys
in this one.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.358
Okay, now everybody go
before I get emotional.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.073
[DJ] I love you.

Hey, guys, why don't we give your mom
a minute with Kimmy and Steph?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.969
[Stephanie] See you soon, buddy.
Thanks, Steve.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.103
I love you ladies.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.438
We know.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.066
We love you, too.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.198

32:17.602 --> 32:21.105
Okay,
so I know we don't have to live here,

32:24.233 --> 32:25.777
but what if we want to?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.989
We can't imagine raising our families
any other way.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.117
Wait, you mean you want to stay?

32:33.952 --> 32:34.953
Of course we do.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.121
It's lonely out there.

32:40.041 --> 32:40.875
Yeah.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.212
Besides, there's nowhere else
I'd rather be.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.757
Especially with a new baby on the way.

[DJ laughs]

33:02.855 --> 33:04.607
I'm so happy for you, Steph.

33:05.441 --> 33:06.734
It's a miracle.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.655
So...

33:11.656 --> 33:12.615
what do you think?

33:14.742 --> 33:15.660
Can we stay?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.121
Of course.
