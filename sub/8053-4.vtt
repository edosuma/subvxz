that some teenagers are digging
bags of dog poop out of the trash

dog poop fights.

Okay, all right.
Cool it! Okay.

BOY 1: Get her shoes!
(SCREAMING) No!

00:48.114 --> 00:49.945
That's disgusting!
What are you doing?

00:50.016 --> 00:53.417
Help! Help! Help! Tom!

think this was fun?

Oh, really? Really?

01:03.863 --> 01:05.455
Oh, hey! Hey!
You like it?

Whoo, missed it!

01:16.376 --> 01:17.468
Yeah!

this is a little fun. This is fun.

Check it out.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.208
Whoa, mama!

01:52.278 --> 01:53.768
(EXHALES) I love
Great Lakes wine.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.647
You can have the wine. I want to take
that cheese and do terrible things to it.

(LESLIE TUTTING)

01:59.219 --> 02:00.413
No, no,
no, no, no!

02:01.087 --> 02:02.418
You know as
well as I do

02:02.489 --> 02:05.617
that we are not allowed
to accept gifts over $25,

02:05.692 --> 02:07.057
for corruption reasons.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.321
We live in
a fish bowl

02:08.394 --> 02:10.225
and the public is
always watching.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.490
That's why I go
two towns over

02:11.564 --> 02:13.429
if I want to rent
a movie with nudity in it.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.489
Mmm.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.091
Yeah, I probably
shouldn't have said that.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.867
But you cannot enjoy this basket,
I'm so sorry.

02:18.938 --> 02:21.429
And so to avoid temptation,
I am gonna lock it up.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.332
When you're
in government,

02:23.409 --> 02:25.377
there's a million ways
to exploit your power.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.404
<i>Have I ever given in</i>
<i>to that temptation?</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:29.914

"that just stands for justice

02:48.234 --> 02:50.600
So, Ann.
I asked April to create one of those

02:50.670 --> 02:53.605
social network Internet profiles
for the Sullivan Street pit.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.436
So, are you guys
ready for the debut?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.635
Yes, can we cut that red
ribbon around your monitor now?

02:57.710 --> 03:00.110
Absolutely.
I love a good ribbon cutting.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.371
(LESLIE EXCLAIMS)

03:02.482 --> 03:03.847
Oh. April,
that's good.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.145
Yeah.
LESLIE: Kids.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.016
Hey, look,
the pit already has six friends.

03:08.888 --> 03:10.321
Oh, yeah. Mark.
Mark's a friend.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.290
Well, you guys gotta
see Mark's profile.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.349
Look at the photos of
these ladies on his page.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.486
Wow.
Ew! Sick.

03:16.563 --> 03:17.928
LESLIE: Maybe those
are his relatives.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.659
Yeah, maybe fake boobs
run in his family.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.497
Look at this lady.
She's got a thong on her face.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.765
Oh, my God, his favorite
movie is <i>Dances With Wolves.</i>

03:25.838 --> 03:27.203
Okay, we're good.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.865
We'll keep checking in on this.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.034
Where is Mark,
anyway?

03:30.109 --> 03:33.374
Attending yet another meeting
of the old boys <i>'</i> club.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.312
<i>LESLIE: Politics is full of boys' clubs,</i>
<i>formal and informal.</i>

03:37.383 --> 03:41.444
Behind me are all the members of the
city council over the past 30 years.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.547
And every day, as a woman,
I have to walk past this wall of men.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.388
It can be very upsetting.
Especially because of that guy.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.420
No matter what
direction I move,

03:49.495 --> 03:51.827
he's always staring
at my chest.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.054
Hmm.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.057
See?

03:55.468 --> 03:57.402
What are they
doing out there?

03:57.470 --> 03:59.438
Wheeling and dealing.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.302
Divvying up the empire.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.372
Oh, my wife got
me this shirt.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.434
She swears it makes me look thinner.

04:05.511 --> 04:06.500
It kind of does.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.513
You know what we should do?
Let's go out there.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.344
Let's bust up
that old boys <i>'</i> club.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.078
We're doing great work in the
government. We deserve to be included.

04:13.152 --> 04:14.779
Sure, yeah.
I could use a beer.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.344
Yes, Ann! That's good,
think like a man.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.753
April, we're leaving,
you're in charge.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.620
And it's because
you're a woman!

04:20.459 --> 04:23.054

red tape and uphill battles?

04:23.129 --> 04:24.255

04:24.330 --> 04:25.388

04:25.465 --> 04:26.489
I'll tell you
what's up.

04:26.566 --> 04:30.366
A couple of ladies are coming to
bust up your little boys <i>'</i> club.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.269
Awesome. Glad to have you.
Let me get you a beer.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.870

04:43.716 --> 04:45.809

What's the topic <i>du jour?</i>

Oh!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.110
(EXCLAIMS)

04:49.455 --> 04:50.615
Did you hear that?

04:51.324 --> 04:54.521
That was the sound of a glass
ceiling being shattered.

04:55.194 --> 04:58.630
<i>LESLIE: The boys' club is more about</i>
<i>socializing than work, you know?</i>

04:58.698 --> 05:00.222
<i>I mean, you gotta loosen up.</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:03.861
I kind of feel like I'm
already in the boys <i>'</i> club.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.404
I mean,
look at those bitches clean up after me.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.236
ANN: So, is this, like,
your regular Tuesday night scene?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.072
Well, it's just a way to unwind,
you know. Mmm-hmm.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.840
Really different from your
Friday night crowd, right?

05:13.913 --> 05:14.902
What crowd?
ANN: You know,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.006
the girls with the
tribal back tattoos

05:17.083 --> 05:18.482
who drink Red Bull
for a living.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.951
Oh! Oh, I like this.
This is banter. That crowd.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.317
LESLIE: Banter's fun.
Where'd that come from?

05:22.388 --> 05:23.650
We were just
on the computer,

05:23.723 --> 05:25.156
looking at
your profile.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.385
You know, you have a friend
who has a tattoo that says,

05:27.460 --> 05:28.757
"Daddy's Girl."

05:28.828 --> 05:30.489
And both words
are misspelled.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.827
Ooh! Mixing it up with the boys!
So...

05:32.899 --> 05:34.457
What are you gonna say?
What's your comeback?

05:34.534 --> 05:36.001
Those aren't really
my friends anymore.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.696
I don't hang out
with them.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.365
Oh, boo. Brendanawicz, that's some
weak sauce. You need to hit harder!

05:42.375 --> 05:44.775
Natalie, it's your sister.

05:45.812 --> 05:49.043
Pick me up or I'm gonna
draw all over your jeans.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.947
Well, it's official, people.
We're out of beer.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.953
That's the cue.
See you later, Leslie.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.254
It was nice hanging out,
you know, after work hours.

06:00.326 --> 06:02.157
Wait!
I think I'm gonna take off, too.

06:02.228 --> 06:03.820
Yeah, I should go, Leslie.
Wait, you guys!

06:03.896 --> 06:05.056
Let's keep this
good feeling going.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.325
It's just getting started!

06:06.399 --> 06:09.493
Uh, yeah, 'cause parties usually get
started when you run out of booze.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.561
Okay, wait.
Just hold on a second.

06:27.954 --> 06:28.943
I got wine!

06:29.021 --> 06:30.420
ALL: Hey!

06:30.490 --> 06:31.479

(EXCLAIMS)

06:37.497 --> 06:39.158
Good morning.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.895
Last night, in a foolish attempt
to infiltrate a boys <i>'</i> club,

06:42.969 --> 06:46.962
<i>I violated the government employee</i>
<i>ethics code of the state of Indiana.</i>

06:47.039 --> 06:50.998
<i>I have always tried to live my life in</i>

06:51.077 --> 06:55.241
<i>I realize I have let down every</i>

06:55.314 --> 06:57.805
<i>and I would like to apologize to them,</i>
<i>right now,</i>

<i>individually, and in</i>
<i>alphabetical order.</i>

07:00.953 --> 07:06.653
Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota.
I am sorry.

07:08.261 --> 07:13.198
Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin.
I'm so sorry, Tammy.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.423
Melissa Bean.

07:25.978 --> 07:30.745
Okay. Double shift, remember?
So I won't see you till tomorrow.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.444
Are you gonna be okay?
Oh, yeah.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.351
I got dinner.

07:35.421 --> 07:38.948
Oh, God. Honey, can you
just clean up a little bit?

07:40.860 --> 07:43.226
I'll try.
Don't expect much.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.856
Okay. I'll do it
when I get home.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.490
You will?
Yes. Yes.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.034
<i>AND Y: Ann is amazing.</i>

07:49.101 --> 07:53.060
<i>She takes care of me, she takes</i>
<i>care of sick people, sick babies.</i>

07:53.139 --> 07:57.235
She is an angel.
And I seriously love her.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.236
Hard.

07:59.946 --> 08:03.677
She's going to be gone for the
next 24 hours so I made this list

08:03.749 --> 08:08.880
<i>and basically this place is gonna be</i>
<i>like a sparkling palace when she returns.</i>

08:09.188 --> 08:10.177
I took a bunch
of painkillers.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.656
They're about to kick in
so I'm ready to go.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.495
There it is.
Let's clear the air.

08:17.563 --> 08:21.522
Last night, I opened up this
gift basket, for my own pleasure.

08:21.601 --> 08:25.935
Really. Leslie Knope. Usually such
a prudish stickler for the rules.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.563
I'm not happy
about it either, Tom.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.335
It's like I don't
even know you anymore.

08:29.408 --> 08:32.376
Last year you wrote me up for making
personal phone calls to my mom.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.106
Yes, I did.
And I would do it again.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.613
Two wrongs do
not make a right.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.615
Yes, but she was
in the hospital.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.611
I did not know
that at the time.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.042
So, can I have
the basket?

08:42.121 --> 08:43.679
No, I'm sorry.
It's evidence.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.780
It's a nice basket.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.882
What would you
put in there?

08:46.959 --> 08:47.948
I don't know.
Potpourri?

08:48.027 --> 08:49.016
That's a lot
of potpourri.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.756
Hey, I am not
the one on trial here.

08:50.830 --> 08:54.197
I appreciate and thank you in
advance for your unwavering support.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.359
I think you
should go to jail.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.163
Think about
what you've done.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.898
Go to jail?
What's going on?

08:59.972 --> 09:03.703
Ron, I have a very important
and very long story to tell you.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.710
Put it in an e-mail?
Nope.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.172
It happened right out there,
right outside this window.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.452
Why can't I look away?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.784
Let's not blow this
out of proportion.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.154
I will blow this
in proportion!

09:19.892 --> 09:21.359
The minimum
punishment for this

09:21.427 --> 09:24.021
is an official reprimand
from the city manager.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.120
It's not that
big a deal.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.165
Maybe in your world
it isn't a big deal.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.964
You're a white Protestant man
with a full, rich mustache.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.231
But I am a woman

09:32.305 --> 09:34.739
and I need to hold myself
up to a higher standard.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.002
(CHUCKLES) This is ridiculous.
You're punishing yourself

09:37.076 --> 09:39.044
more than anybody else
is gonna punish you.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.238
No.
What do you suggest we do?

09:41.314 --> 09:42.906
You think we should cover this up?

09:42.982 --> 09:45.883
No, I'm not saying that.
No one said cover-up.

09:45.952 --> 09:49.115
Good, because the cover-up
is worse than the crime.

09:49.188 --> 09:51.452
When you spill something
and you try to wipe it up

09:51.524 --> 09:52.957
with something
that's dirty,

09:53.025 --> 09:55.050
then you get
double dirty.

09:55.127 --> 09:56.253
Please don't
make this worse.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.557
Oh, my God.

09:57.630 --> 09:58.927
Good afternoon.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.958
Since we last spoke,
I have taken extraordinary steps

10:03.035 --> 10:05.731
to make further amends for
the mistakes that I have made.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.739
<i>LESLIE: I have written</i>

I've also attached a link
to the pit's web page,

10:16.816 --> 10:19.410
just to remind people of
all the good work that I do.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.513
I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me,
and he refused.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.523
And that is why I had
to whistle-blow myself.

10:29.028 --> 10:33.727
<i>AND Y: I wish I could say some of this</i>
<i>mess was Ann's, but it's all mine.</i>

10:33.799 --> 10:35.266
<i>I'm kind of a nester.</i>

10:37.370 --> 10:40.066
Huh?
Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.104
Hey.

10:50.950 --> 10:51.974
Hey.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.746

the pit's web page.

11:00.893 --> 11:03.088
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>drinking wine is winning...</i>

11:03.162 --> 11:04.754
Oh, my God.
What am I looking at?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.162
A video of me drinking some
of that wine you stole.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.224
What? Why did
you do this?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.633
Because I was waiting for
my sister and I was bored,

11:12.705 --> 11:14.297
and my hair
looked really good.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.534
And you put it in
the pit's web page?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.474
Yeah.
Okay, take this off.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.307
Okay. I just sent an e-mail
to everyone in the government,

11:20.379 --> 11:21.505
and I put a link
to this page!

11:21.580 --> 11:22.672

11:27.586 --> 11:28.575
JERRY: You got it.

11:33.926 --> 11:34.915
Leslie?

11:35.428 --> 11:36.952
She's 19 years old.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.591
I thought I told you
not to make this worse.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.859
And I heard you
loud and clear.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.798
But then you
made it worse.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.304
The disciplinary committee
is having a hearing tomorrow,

11:46.372 --> 11:48.169
and you're gonna
have to testify.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.835
Oh, no.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.900
April might get dismissed.
You could get fired.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.138
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.271
Oh, no.

Oh, God.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.677
(EXCLAIMS) This bench
is so uncomfortable.

11:58.751 --> 12:02.380
Ow. Help.
Please, Ron. Ron.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.252
Ron, tell me
it's gonna be okay.

12:04.323 --> 12:06.154
Tell me it's gonna be okay.

Hang in.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.021
Ron!
Okay. You're okay.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.556
(CRYING) Good evening.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.592
I've spoken to you a couple of
times about something that happened,

12:18.671 --> 12:20.104
but I don't want to...

12:21.006 --> 12:23.406
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

12:25.277 --> 12:28.144
So, the disciplinary
committee awaits.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.272

Feeling strong?

12:29.348 --> 12:30.508
Not really. No.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.073
Do you want me to run some
test questions with you?

12:32.151 --> 12:35.177
Maybe give you an idea of what the
disciplinary committee will be like?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.812
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah, thanks, Tom.

12:36.889 --> 12:38.083
Okay.

12:38.891 --> 12:43.328
So, Miss Knope,
you're accused of stealing wine.

12:44.196 --> 12:46.790
How many drinks do you have per week,
on average?

12:46.866 --> 12:47.958
Zero.

12:48.734 --> 12:49.723
Zero to six.

12:49.802 --> 12:52.965
I'm gonna write down 10.
Yeah.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.369
Do you ever cheat
on your taxes?

12:54.440 --> 12:55.964
No, no, no. Never.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.668
Good. You're doing great.

12:57.743 --> 13:00.303
How many sexual partners have
you had in the last year?

13:00.379 --> 13:01.403
Are they gonna ask that?

13:01.480 --> 13:02.845
This is a deposition-style hearing,
Miss Knope.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.439
Nothing is off-limits.
You have to answer.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.816
Now, how many sexual partners
have you had in the last year?

13:08.687 --> 13:10.518
Zero to six.
Zero.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.080
Have you ever thought
about Ron sexually? What?

13:13.159 --> 13:14.183
Including dreams.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.252
Have you ever had a sexual dream
about our boss, Ron Swanson?

13:17.329 --> 13:19.729
No! Absolutely not.
No. Yes.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.630
No.
Now, in this recurring dream

13:21.700 --> 13:23.861
that you have about Ron,
is he like a regular Ron,

13:23.936 --> 13:26.928
or is he half-Ron, half-animal,
like a centaur?

13:27.006 --> 13:27.995
What? No...

13:28.073 --> 13:29.631
Is he wearing
a football uniform?

13:29.742 --> 13:33.178
Are you making love to him on a
couch shaped like his mustache?

13:33.245 --> 13:34.439
Is he covered
in Powerade?

13:34.513 --> 13:35.810
No, okay.
Time-out. Time-out.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.644
This committee doesn't
take time-outs, Miss Knope.

13:37.716 --> 13:38.774
Now answer
the question!

13:38.851 --> 13:39.840
I need something to drink.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.284
How about some
stolen wine?

13:41.353 --> 13:42.581
No. I meant water.

13:43.455 --> 13:45.923
Thank you for your time,
Miss Knope. You're fired.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.588
So, that's kind of your
worst-case scenario, you know?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.095
If you can handle that,
I think you'll be fine.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.055
Great.

like to drink beer

14:44.984 --> 14:47.043
in the courtyard
on Tuesday nights.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.282
No one is supposed to drink
alcohol on government property.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.449
That's not my department.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.151
Go ahead, Leslie.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.791

unwise decision.

But you did open the gift basket.
And the intern did drink the wine.

Please don't blame
her for my mistake.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.265
The biggest crime
we could commit here

would be to destroy a teenage

Can you go over the time
line for us once more?

Yes, of course.

Ron, it's okay.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.464
No, it's not.
This is not communist China.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.002
You cannot make
her whip herself.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.300
You cannot make her
wear a hair shirt.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.098
We weren't planning on doing
either of those things.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.698
This is America.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.819
We're done, let's go.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.728
So, after all that,
it's really not that bad.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.897
You're gonna get

Don't worry about it.

18:02.848 --> 18:08.013
No, I didn't do it for Leslie.
I did it because I hate bureaucracy.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.887
My idea of a perfect
government is one guy,

18:11.957 --> 18:14.050
who sits in
a small room at a desk,

18:14.126 --> 18:17.687
and the only thing he's allowed
to decide is who to nuke.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.926
The man is chosen based
on some kind of IQ test,

18:20.999 --> 18:24.526

like a decathlon.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.168

opened that stupid basket.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.118
Yeah. Why did you
open that basket?

18:47.192 --> 18:48.784
It doesn't really
seem like you.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.988
I think it's 'cause I wanted
to shatter the glass ceiling.

kind of infiltrate the boys <i>'</i> club.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.175
Andy.
This is so sweet.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.269
It's nothing.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.608
What happened to you?

19:42.681 --> 19:46.481
Oh, I was chasing our
neighbor who's a total jagweed

19:46.552 --> 19:48.952
and I fell in
some prickly bushes.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.884
Doesn't matter.
What do you think of the house, huh?

19:52.424 --> 19:53.914
Were you totally surprised?
Yeah.

19:53.992 --> 19:56.119
Do you love it?
Yeah.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.186
Here, baby. Sit down. I'm gonna
put something on those scratches.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.252
(GRUNTING)

20:00.732 --> 20:03.792
Somebody is getting
gently laid tonight.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.429
Andy! God!

20:14.880 --> 20:16.507
You look like you
need one of these.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.406
(SIGHS)

20:18.483 --> 20:20.883
Come on.
You're over 21.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.751
You're not supposed to be
drinking on government property.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.813
Loosen up. You're gonna
drive yourself crazy

20:25.891 --> 20:28.416
trying to follow every
single rule in government.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.927
Mark, I have
a letter in my file.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.362
I got seven letters
in my file.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.900
Pretty much every guy in city
planning has a bunch of letters.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.404
So, welcome to the team.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.712
Look out, boys.
I'm in your club now.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.145
I'm in your club.
I'm in your club.

20:50.215 --> 20:51.512
I'm in your club.
I'm in your club.

20:51.583 --> 20:55.246
I'm in your club. I'm in your club.
I'm in your... Mmm. Creepy.
