WEBVTT

00:29.208 --> 00:31.791
Yeah?
<i>It's me.</i>

00:31.833 --> 00:33.916
<i>Remember what we talked about?</i>

00:33.958 --> 00:35.750
<i>Take care of the problem.</i>

00:35.791 --> 00:38.750
<i>This is a lot of money
we're talking about here.</i>

00:38.791 --> 00:40.833
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Yeah, I got this.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.208
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

00:54.958 --> 00:57.291
Watch my back
and don't fuck this up.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.666
Come on, come on, come on.

02:57.208 --> 02:59.458
<i>In local news,
police are still looking</i>

02:59.500 --> 03:02.458
<i>for two masked men after
reports of an armed robbery</i>

03:02.500 --> 03:05.500
<i>at McCarthy's
Payday Loans in Shamrock.</i>

03:05.541 --> 03:08.458
<i>Gunshots were heard on the
street at approximately 11pm.</i>

03:08.500 --> 03:11.458
<i>Witnesses reported
a dark BMW plate...</i>

03:20.208 --> 03:23.000
- Hello.
<i>He fucked us.</i>

03:23.041 --> 03:25.666
- What?
<i>- Detour, Creston Ave.</i>

03:26.916 --> 03:29.416
<i>The bus stop outside
the hardware store.</i>

03:29.458 --> 03:31.458
<i>- He's waiting for you there.</i>
- Who's waiting for...

03:31.500 --> 03:33.375
what? What's going on?

03:33.416 --> 03:34.833
<i>The kid, he fucked us.</i>

03:34.875 --> 03:36.791
<i>He can't be trusted.</i>

03:36.833 --> 03:38.625
<i>Drive him over here
and we'll do the rest.</i>

03:38.666 --> 03:41.250
<i>- You can have his cut.</i>
- I don't want his cut.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.583
That was not our deal.
I'm not your errand boy.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.166
<i>Just get him here, make sure
you're not being followed.</i>

03:47.166 --> 03:49.166
Just get... get someone else.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.958
<i>Don't let him know
anything's up.</i>

03:51.000 --> 03:52.833
Wait. What did he do?

03:55.041 --> 03:56.375
Hello?

04:53.625 --> 04:55.250
What the hell is this?

04:55.291 --> 04:57.208
I'm sorry we're late.
I lost track of time.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.208
We were getting ice-cream.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.833
I gotta drop her
off at her mom's.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.000
It's only a couple
blocks from here.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.833
Do I look like a taxi to you?

05:02.875 --> 05:06.208
Please, I have to.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.708
Man, I just got the call.
How would I have known?

05:08.750 --> 05:10.333
You mind if I put her
in the back?

05:10.375 --> 05:12.000
Leave it! Don't.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.666
This is bullshit.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.583
Sorry.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.208
I can't help it, man.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.791
Do they always just call
in the middle of nowhere,

05:25.833 --> 05:27.375
like just, "Let's go"?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.208
Do not slam the doors.

05:35.666 --> 05:37.583
Where?

05:37.625 --> 05:40.083
- Oakmere.
- Oakmere?

05:40.125 --> 05:42.291
You know we're on
a schedule, right?

05:42.333 --> 05:44.708
That is a six-minute detour.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.833
This is not daddy-daughter day.

05:56.666 --> 05:59.291
Hey.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.000
Oink!

06:01.041 --> 06:03.125
Yeah.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.541
So how does this work?

06:05.583 --> 06:07.666
Do we just go,
collect our cut and that's it

06:07.708 --> 06:09.250
or are we getting another job?

06:09.291 --> 06:10.750
What are you thinking?

06:12.791 --> 06:14.166
Don't worry about her,
by the way.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.583
She... she's three years old.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.791
She's not gonna be
talking to anybody.

06:16.833 --> 06:19.458
Yeah, well, in this car,

06:19.500 --> 06:22.125
we don't talk about our business
in front of anyone.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.541
Definitely.

06:37.791 --> 06:39.625
Hey, we'll get some
ice-cream tomorrow, alright?

06:39.666 --> 06:41.000
Yeah.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.958
Daddy's gotta go
pick up some money.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.791
You're closing
early tonight.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.083
Stop what you're doing

07:00.125 --> 07:01.666
or I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.833
You don't wanna do this.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.000
Oh, but I'm sure
I fucking want to.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.541
- Stay right there!
- Dad?

07:09.583 --> 07:12.083
Shut the fuck up!
Hit the lights.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.708
You got it.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.625
What you fucking
waiting for? Get up!

07:19.291 --> 07:20.958
Come on, come on, come on.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.625
Do you know who I am?

07:23.666 --> 07:26.708
I know exactly who you are.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.208
Then you know you're making
a big fucking mistake.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.833
Yeah? Is that
supposed to scare me?

07:35.708 --> 07:38.458
I've been in this line
of work over 40 years.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.958
You think you're
the first asshole

07:40.000 --> 07:42.083
to wave a gun in my face?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.916
- Get the fuck up!
- Let me tell you...

07:46.166 --> 07:50.208
...no-one has ever tried
stealing from me

07:50.250 --> 07:54.291
and lived long enough
to spend a fucking dime.

07:54.333 --> 07:58.208
Yeah, is that right?
Get down. Get the fuck down!

07:58.250 --> 07:59.750
I'll be the first one
to do it right.

08:02.708 --> 08:06.291
You had your chance to
just walk right out of here.

08:06.333 --> 08:08.000
Put the fucking gun down!

08:08.041 --> 08:09.916
No-one needs to get hurt!

08:13.583 --> 08:14.958
Where's Mommy?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.625
I'm gonna drop you off
with your Mommy.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.166
What are you doing here?

08:18.208 --> 08:20.000
Listen, I have to go
pick up the money, alright?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.666
You fucking kidding me?
- I know.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.583
- They just called me.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

08:23.625 --> 08:26.208
I have work in half an hour.
You said you would take her.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.875
- What am I supposed to do?

08:27.916 --> 08:29.125
Hey!

08:30.541 --> 08:32.833
- Jesus!
It's a lot of money.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.291
Yeah, dirty money.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.208
And if I don't go to work,
I'll get fucking fired.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.500
You know I need those tips.

08:43.125 --> 08:45.041
Come on, come on.

08:48.708 --> 08:51.208
Shit.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.041
I'm doing this for you,
I'm doing it for her.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.416
I don't wanna hear it.
You know what?

08:54.458 --> 08:55.625
You wanna do something for us,

08:55.666 --> 08:57.208
just do what you say
you're gonna do.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.916
I'll make it up to you, alright?

08:58.958 --> 09:00.333
Fuck off.

09:14.666 --> 09:16.041
Sorry about that.

09:18.916 --> 09:21.083
This whole
situation's temporary.

09:22.791 --> 09:24.125
She deserves better.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.750
What about you? You got kids?

09:28.750 --> 09:30.000
I saw you're married.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.750
Been doing this
for a while, haven't you?

09:37.458 --> 09:38.791
I could tell.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.833
Probably got a nice place, huh?

09:43.541 --> 09:45.458
I wanna get something
big for her.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.000
Something like
on a corner street,

09:47.041 --> 09:48.625
one of those big mansions.

09:48.666 --> 09:50.833
If it's not about the job,
I don't need to know, alright?

09:54.666 --> 09:56.291
So where's the meet?

09:59.791 --> 10:01.166
It's about the job.

10:02.791 --> 10:05.500
- It's Wyevale.
- Wyevale?

10:05.541 --> 10:07.750
Jesus Christ, that's far.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.750
I don't know.
You wanna get paid or what?

10:09.791 --> 10:11.250
We're going to Wyevale.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.708
Yeah.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.208
Jesus.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.458
I'm guessing your friend's
gonna be there tonight.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.000
I don't know if you
believe in karma

10:43.041 --> 10:45.333
and I'm no fucking Buddha,
but that shit,

10:45.375 --> 10:47.791
there's no way that's not
gonna catch up to him.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.291
He's a fucking animal, man.

10:50.541 --> 10:52.208
We had everything under control.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.250
You know, nobody had to get
hurt, especially like that.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.208
I don't know what his
fucking problem was.

10:59.833 --> 11:03.041
Whoa! Hey, what's going on?

11:08.208 --> 11:09.541
What? What? What?

11:09.583 --> 11:11.208
Hey, eyes forward.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.416
What the hell
is going on, dude?

11:22.125 --> 11:24.083
It's nothing.
I thought it was something.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.083
Are you carrying?

11:32.041 --> 11:33.291
No.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.958
Should I be?

11:56.291 --> 11:58.166
That's real leather, isn't it?

11:59.166 --> 12:00.875
Yeah.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.625
Cool. It's very nice, man.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.208
What year is this?

12:06.208 --> 12:07.166
'70.

12:08.416 --> 12:10.833
Wow. Fuck, that's old.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.041
Ancient.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.000
I was born in '70.

12:18.291 --> 12:21.250
Wow. You're... you're
pretty young, actually.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.791
1970. That's not long ago.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.458
It's pretty sweet. Must have
cost you something, huh?

12:26.500 --> 12:28.000
Nope. It was a gift.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.375
A gift?

12:31.625 --> 12:35.208
Holy shit. That's a nice gift.

12:36.416 --> 12:37.958
Wow!

12:39.333 --> 12:41.000
Good Lord, man,
the only gift I ever got

12:41.041 --> 12:42.541
was my first baseball mitt

12:42.583 --> 12:44.208
and that was my brother's
hand-me-down at that.

12:45.458 --> 12:48.916
Clearly, I'm hanging
with the wrong people.

12:50.583 --> 12:54.625
Get out of fucking town.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.666
A cigarette lighter?

12:56.708 --> 12:59.375
Nice, very nice.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.166
Tell me that works.
Tell me that works.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.833
You know, that's what
a lot of people

13:15.875 --> 13:17.041
don't get about superheroes.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.625
It's, like,
we can relate to them

13:18.666 --> 13:19.916
a whole lot more
than people think.

13:19.958 --> 13:21.625
Like, I relate a lot.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.375
My kid, though,
she loves Batgirl.

13:24.416 --> 13:27.416
We watch Batman and stuff all
the time. Like, it's so fun.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.958
And, yeah, like, we love
to go to the theme parks.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.250
- Do you go to the theme parks?
- No.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.708
Yeah, I didn't think so.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.333
But if you went,
you would love it, like...

13:37.625 --> 13:39.125
...there's just something
about a theme park.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.958
You get to just roam around

13:41.000 --> 13:43.416
and, you know,
be a little kid again.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.041
And now that my kid's
three years old,

13:46.083 --> 13:50.000
it's, like, so fun for us
to do it together and just...

13:50.041 --> 13:52.208
We don't bring my wife
'cause she's a bitch.

13:52.250 --> 13:55.583
You know, she and I love
to dress up for Halloween.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.833
You know, she's Batgirl
and I'm Batman.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.625
We're all into that, you know?

14:00.666 --> 14:02.333
And that's what I love
about Batman, you know?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.875
Face your fears, you know?

14:03.916 --> 14:06.166
And, yeah, it's a good time.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.291
Every time you're dressing up
with your kid,

14:08.333 --> 14:09.791
you know, it's always, like...

14:09.833 --> 14:13.250
Yeah, we're not...
we're not strict on each other.

14:14.500 --> 14:15.916
This is taking too long!

14:15.958 --> 14:18.000
You don't have
the balls, you pussy.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.208
Point the gun at his boy!

14:20.250 --> 14:22.833
- It's two to one!
- Put the fucking gun down now!

14:22.875 --> 14:24.208
You wanna know
how this plays out?

14:24.250 --> 14:27.000
You shoot me, he shoots him,
your son is dead.

14:27.041 --> 14:29.208
You want that?
Last fucking chance!

14:29.250 --> 14:31.041
Dad, just please fucking
listen to him! Please!

14:31.083 --> 14:33.208
Right fucking now.
You want your kid to die?

14:33.250 --> 14:35.375
- He looks a little shaky to me.
I don't know.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.666
I think he looks a little
fucking trigger happy.

14:37.708 --> 14:39.458
You wanna find the fuck out?

14:39.500 --> 14:42.416
Put the goddamn gun down
or your son gets it.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.500
All the way fucking down.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.916
- Attaboy.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.833
Not so tough now, huh?

14:54.875 --> 14:57.541
Let's go. To the back.

15:02.416 --> 15:05.166
Just give us
the cash and we're gone.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.791
Is that it?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.250
Let's go. Open it up.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.541
- Fucking open it up.
- Just do what he says!

15:14.583 --> 15:16.000
That's right.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.875
Oh, fuck!

15:18.916 --> 15:21.250
- You wanna play these games?

15:21.291 --> 15:23.625
- I'm playing these games!
- Stop!

15:23.666 --> 15:25.666
- Stop, you fucking ass!
- Let's not play these games.

15:25.708 --> 15:26.583
Open the fucking safe!

15:26.625 --> 15:28.208
- Stop!
- Let's go!

15:30.916 --> 15:32.458
I'm tired
of your bullshit.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.458
Easy.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.500
Any fucking day now.

15:40.541 --> 15:43.000
Keep your
fucking head down!

15:43.041 --> 15:44.166
Come on. Let's go!

15:48.750 --> 15:50.166
You know you're not
just stealing from me.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.416
You know that, right?

15:51.458 --> 15:54.125
Hurry the fuck up!
Throw it on the ground.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.041
Let's go. Go.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.166
Let's go. Out.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.666
Who is that?

16:19.750 --> 16:21.291
Seriously, man,
what's going on?

16:21.333 --> 16:24.541
- Where are you taking me?
- I already told you, Wyevale.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.375
It's just my wife.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.583
Better pick it up.
She's gonna be pissed.

16:44.625 --> 16:48.875
She doesn't like you
working, huh? Is that it?

16:50.583 --> 16:54.833
Yeah, huh, what else
are you gonna do, right?

16:54.875 --> 16:57.625
There's no other fucking job
in this shit-hole town.

16:57.666 --> 16:58.958
Trust me.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.291
You know,
I was gonna be a fireman.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.166
I was gonna rescue people
out of burning buildings

17:07.208 --> 17:08.958
and cats from trees,
all that shit,

17:09.000 --> 17:10.791
then I find out
how much they make,

17:10.833 --> 17:13.208
I'm like, "Fuck that shit!

17:13.250 --> 17:17.166
"If I'm gonna risk my life,
I wanna make some real cash."

17:20.125 --> 17:23.583
What about you? You... you
a rally driver or something?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.125
That shit didn't work out?

17:26.125 --> 17:27.458
- Hmm?

17:27.500 --> 17:28.916
Close, aren't I?

17:31.916 --> 17:34.125
You know, we don't
have to do this.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.666
Don't have to do what?

17:37.291 --> 17:39.541
Fill every fucking silence.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.166
Sorry.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.833
Yeah, or we could
listen to that.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.208
What is that?

18:23.208 --> 18:25.750
- What is what?
- Is that a burner?

18:25.791 --> 18:27.708
What's the deal?
What's the problem, man?

18:27.750 --> 18:30.375
What's the matter with you, huh?
Anybody could be tracking that.

18:30.416 --> 18:32.416
Throw it out
the window right now.

18:32.458 --> 18:34.750
No, I'm not throwing it
out the fucking window!

18:34.791 --> 18:36.250
- I just bought this.
- Are you kidding me?

18:36.291 --> 18:37.833
- Out the window now!

18:37.875 --> 18:39.958
- No, I'll power it...

18:44.625 --> 18:45.791
You fucking happy?

18:45.833 --> 18:48.500
Yes, I'm happy now.

18:48.541 --> 18:51.208
- Goddamn it, man!
- Anybody could be tracking that.

18:51.250 --> 18:54.208
Nobody's tracking my phone,
you paranoid fuck.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.833
If you fuck me on this,
I swear to God...

19:30.708 --> 19:32.375
I gotta call my wife.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.083
What the fuck, man?

19:35.125 --> 19:37.416
What was all that bullshit
about no calling?

19:37.458 --> 19:39.625
What the hell?

19:39.666 --> 19:41.708
Trust is earned, alright?

19:41.750 --> 19:44.041
Get back to me when you've done
more than one fucking job

19:44.083 --> 19:45.458
and we'll talk.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.875
I was thirsty anyway.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.000
<i>We said no more detours.</i>
- Who is this?

20:02.041 --> 20:03.833
<i>Stop flapping your gums
and get over here.</i>

20:03.875 --> 20:05.833
- Put Veronica on.
<i>- No names.</i>

20:05.875 --> 20:07.375
<i>And don't keep her waiting.</i>

20:07.416 --> 20:08.833
No, we're not going anywhere

20:08.875 --> 20:11.416
till you tell me
what's going on, alright?

20:11.458 --> 20:13.583
Who's he been talking to?

20:13.625 --> 20:15.208
He had his cellphone with him.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.750
You know, anybody
could be tracking him.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.458
Tell me what you know,
you no-name fuck.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.500
<i>- 25,000.</i>
- What?

20:22.541 --> 20:25.875
<i>- The count was missing 25 grand.</i>
- How do you know that?

20:25.916 --> 20:27.791
<i>Shaun McCarthy,
fucking Frank's kid.</i>

20:27.833 --> 20:29.250
<i>He tipped us off
that his old man</i>

20:29.291 --> 20:31.625
<i>had exactly 900
packed up in his safe.</i>

20:31.666 --> 20:33.375
<i>It's 25 light.</i>

20:33.416 --> 20:35.541
That's it? You're gonna
kill him over 25 grand?

20:35.583 --> 20:37.166
Are you insane?

20:37.208 --> 20:39.958
How do we know for sure
it was even in there?

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
<i>We're 25 short and someone
is gonna fucking pay.</i>

20:43.041 --> 20:44.625
Who the fuck are you?

20:44.666 --> 20:46.333
<i>Don't turn up without him.</i>

20:48.291 --> 20:49.708
Shit.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.333
Pack of smokes.
Sorry.

21:20.375 --> 21:22.416
The delivery
didn't come in today.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.333
What, so you're out?

21:24.375 --> 21:26.208
Yeah, that's what I just said.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.875
The fuck you mean, you're out?

21:27.916 --> 21:29.791
What, you ain't got
one pack of smokes in there?

21:29.833 --> 21:31.000
- You're lying.
- No.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.583
<i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, it's me.

21:48.625 --> 21:51.708
<i>- Where are you calling from?</i>
- A pay phone.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.166
<i>Where's your cell?</i>

21:55.958 --> 21:57.375
<i>You're working again,
aren't you?</i>

21:57.416 --> 21:59.416
<i>Jesus, how much
did you lose this time?</i>

21:59.458 --> 22:01.375
Not now, alright, Hayley?
Just...

22:01.416 --> 22:03.791
- How's he doing?

22:05.666 --> 22:08.666
<i>- He's fine.</i>
- Yeah? Can you put him on?

22:08.708 --> 22:11.166
<i>Christopher, it's your dad.</i>

22:12.708 --> 22:15.208
<i>Dad?</i>
- Hey.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.416
How's it going?
How's Pittsburgh treating you?

22:17.458 --> 22:19.041
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Yeah?

22:19.083 --> 22:20.958
You having any fun?
What have you been up to?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.458
<i>- Um, Pete took me fishing.</i>
- Yeah?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.250
Oh, that's great.
You catch anything?

22:25.291 --> 22:26.625
<i>25-pound flathead.</i>

22:26.666 --> 22:29.250
Whoa! You got a picture?

22:29.291 --> 22:31.291
You gotta give me a picture
or it didn't happen.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.666
<i>Yeah, it's on
Pete's phone, I think.</i>

22:33.708 --> 22:36.875
- Oh, cool.
<i>- I'll send it to you.</i>

22:36.916 --> 22:38.750
It's good to hear your voice.

22:41.166 --> 22:43.750
Hey, I'm gonna come and pick
you up next week, alright?

22:43.791 --> 22:45.375
<i>I hope so.</i>

22:46.791 --> 22:48.833
Hey, I can't talk long.

22:48.875 --> 22:51.250
Will you put
your auntie back on?

22:51.291 --> 22:52.958
Enjoy the rest of
your break, alright?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.500
<i>OK, Dad.</i>

22:54.541 --> 22:57.250
Hey, I love you.

23:00.833 --> 23:02.750
<i>I'm surprised
you remembered the number.</i>

23:02.791 --> 23:04.625
Yeah, it's the same
since we were kids.

23:04.666 --> 23:07.958
<i>He's happy here. You have
a family and a life here.</i>

23:08.000 --> 23:10.083
Listen, hey,
I can't do this right now.

23:10.125 --> 23:11.666
<i>- It's always the same.</i>
- Alright, Hayley?

23:11.708 --> 23:14.208
<i>- It's been a year.</i>
- You don't think I know that?

23:14.250 --> 23:16.083
<i>He needs a fresh start
so he can move on.</i>

23:16.125 --> 23:17.916
I...I gotta go. I gotta go.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.625
<i>Just please think about...</i>

23:26.583 --> 23:29.583
- No.
- Oh, yeah, but with this shit...

23:29.625 --> 23:32.750
Oh, my God.
Just fuck off. Get out.

23:32.791 --> 23:34.333
Tasty shit.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.958
Hey, you guys done?
I got somewhere to be.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.291
Hey.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.500
Wait your turn.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.500
You're doing
a good job, alright?

23:49.541 --> 23:50.875
- Don't worry about these guys.
- Thank you.

23:50.916 --> 23:53.125
- Have a good night.
- You too.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.208
Hey! Hey!

24:07.458 --> 24:09.583
Don't worry about them.
They're assholes.

25:40.708 --> 25:44.250
- Oh, what the fuck, man?

25:44.291 --> 25:46.583
Oh, you're calling McCarthy.

25:50.583 --> 25:52.666
You won't
be hard to find.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.083
And when we do find you,
just know this.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.166
- You're a fucking dead man.
Come on.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.541
Let's go. Come on, come on.

26:04.583 --> 26:08.791
Yeah, you get used to looking
over your shoulder, asshole.

26:08.833 --> 26:10.750
Time's up! Let's fucking go!

26:10.791 --> 26:12.291
The fuck you say to me?

26:13.666 --> 26:15.375
You heard me.

26:15.416 --> 26:19.166
'Cause when we find out
who you are, I swear to God...

26:19.208 --> 26:20.208
Ugh!

26:20.250 --> 26:21.625
Dude, what the hell, man?

26:21.666 --> 26:23.666
No, I didn't hear!

26:23.708 --> 26:26.000
- Ugh!
- Say it again!

26:29.083 --> 26:31.791
Hey, man! Stop, stop!

26:31.833 --> 26:33.458
Let's go. We got we needed.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.916
Back off!

26:34.958 --> 26:36.500
- Hey, now!

26:36.541 --> 26:38.250
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

26:38.291 --> 26:40.666
- Hey, hey! Back up, back up!
- What the fuck...

26:40.708 --> 26:42.125
The fuck is wrong
with you, huh?!

26:42.166 --> 26:44.375
This is not what
we fucking talked about!

26:44.416 --> 26:47.541
- Fuck you!
- Get the fuck out of here!

26:47.583 --> 26:49.916
- Fuck you!
- Let's fucking go.

26:49.958 --> 26:51.291
Let's fucking go!
- We got what we needed.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.541
Let's go.

26:53.833 --> 26:55.458
Fuck!

26:57.458 --> 26:59.333
Goddamn it, man.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.333
I mean, what the fuck
was that, man?

27:01.375 --> 27:03.208
Bro, fucking relax.
Let's go.

27:08.041 --> 27:11.416
- Fuck! Go, go, go!

27:11.458 --> 27:14.250
- We'll fucking find you!

27:14.291 --> 27:15.708
Assholes!

27:44.833 --> 27:48.208
Shit. Same guys
from the gas station.

27:50.250 --> 27:53.041
Looks like a different vehicle.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.125
Just stay down. Cover your ears.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.083
- Whoa. Hey.

28:37.125 --> 28:39.333
Are we good?
Are we being followed or what?

28:39.375 --> 28:41.458
I thought so,
but I think we're clear.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.333
I mean, well, you could
put your gun back.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.333
Hey, just so you know...

29:00.958 --> 29:02.833
...he's no friend of mine.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.375
Who are you talking about?

29:06.416 --> 29:08.791
That piece of shit
you were working with,

29:08.833 --> 29:10.416
you called him my friend.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.375
You worked with him before?

29:13.416 --> 29:15.375
Yeah.

29:15.416 --> 29:17.041
Never again.

29:18.958 --> 29:22.250
I've never seen somebody get
fucked up like that before, man.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.208
Not like that, not up close.

29:27.750 --> 29:31.916
I mean, I keep playing that shit
over and over in my head,

29:31.958 --> 29:34.833
just boots
just hitting his skull.

29:37.041 --> 29:38.083
I mean, I should've stepped in.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.500
I should've stopped him
or something.

29:39.541 --> 29:40.750
You couldn't have stopped him.

29:40.791 --> 29:42.875
He's a fucking animal,
just like you said.

29:42.916 --> 29:45.791
That shit is on him.
He lost his cool.

29:45.833 --> 29:49.166
You did your part.
Just let it go.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.666
I'm not saying
McCarthy deserved it,

29:53.708 --> 29:55.791
but he laundered
a shit-ton of money

29:55.833 --> 30:00.208
for a ton of shitty people,
so... fuck him too.

30:02.041 --> 30:03.250
Yeah.

30:04.666 --> 30:06.500
Fuck him.

30:08.750 --> 30:12.000
Hey, listen, what happened
back at that gas station...

30:12.041 --> 30:14.875
...I don't... I don't make
a habit of doing that shit.

30:14.916 --> 30:17.958
I...I just drive.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.375
They just caught me
on a bad day.

30:20.416 --> 30:22.500
Huh, I should say.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.791
What'd you do? What the fuck
happened back there?!

30:37.583 --> 30:40.041
Fuck!

30:40.083 --> 30:42.875
Fucking kid freaked out
is what happened, man!

30:42.916 --> 30:45.291
That piece of shit
got what he fucking deserved.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.416
Shut the fuck up!

30:48.500 --> 30:50.958
Yeah, well, I think you
fucking killed him, man!

30:51.000 --> 30:53.291
- Jesus!
- Fuck you! Shut the fuck up!

30:53.333 --> 30:56.541
That asshole owes my brother
a lot of fucking money!

30:59.875 --> 31:02.000
Well, you did too and
you fucking got shot, you idiot!

31:02.041 --> 31:04.333
We fucking got
the job done, didn't we?

31:04.375 --> 31:05.625
Shut the fuck up!

31:41.208 --> 31:43.916
- Shit.

31:45.916 --> 31:47.666
What do they want, man?

31:47.708 --> 31:50.125
Jesus, we weren't speeding.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.291
This thing's not stolen, is it?

32:04.333 --> 32:06.458
No, it isn't stolen.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.083
Don't say anything stupid.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.541
I don't want them
to search the car.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.583
- Evening, fellas. Licence.
- Officer.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.208
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.375
I'm looking for a car
just like this.

32:28.416 --> 32:31.083
Yeah, they're getting rarer
to come by these days.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.208
Yeah, they are.
Not many in this area.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.166
- No.
- You from out of town?

32:35.208 --> 32:37.416
Uh, yeah,
just outside of Ashland.

32:37.458 --> 32:40.125
In fact, I picked this up at
a classic dealer up that way.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.583
I didn't say
I was looking to buy.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.583
I said I'm looking
for a car like this,

32:43.625 --> 32:45.458
a black 1970 Chevelle,

32:45.500 --> 32:48.541
last seen at a gas station
a few miles back.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.625
Oh, we haven't been to any
gas stations this evening.

32:50.666 --> 32:51.875
- Mn-mn.
- Is that right?

32:51.916 --> 32:53.041
- No, sir.
- The clerk called it in.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.291
Said there was an altercation.

32:54.333 --> 32:56.666
Well, I hope everybody's OK.

33:02.750 --> 33:05.541
We like to keep the peace
around these parts.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.000
Yes, sir.

33:14.416 --> 33:16.458
That blood on your jacket?

33:16.500 --> 33:19.166
Uh... Oh, yeah.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.666
He just gets nose bleeds
every now and then.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.083
Hey, am I talking to you?

33:24.333 --> 33:27.083
Wait, wait.
Ain't you Keith's kid?

33:27.125 --> 33:29.083
Shit, that is you.
It's Jacob, right?

33:29.125 --> 33:31.625
Jake, yeah. What's up, Carl?

33:31.666 --> 33:33.291
Last time I saw you,

33:33.333 --> 33:36.375
you must have been 11 or 12
at the Crescent.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.166
Your old man loved that bar.

33:38.208 --> 33:39.916
- Always brought you in.
-  Yeah.

33:39.958 --> 33:41.875
You know it's a parking lot now,
would you believe?

33:50.750 --> 33:52.875
Goddamn rubbernecks.

33:52.916 --> 33:56.000
How your old man doing?
Haven't seen him in years.

33:56.041 --> 33:57.958
Oh, man, he's doing great.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.791
Yeah, still bowling
every Friday night.

33:59.833 --> 34:02.041
I bet. I tell you what.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.916
Get him to give me a call.
It's been too long.

34:05.916 --> 34:08.125
Yeah, he'd like that.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.291
Shit.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.375
Alright, fellas, I'm gonna
let you be on your way.

34:24.625 --> 34:27.000
Tell Keith I look
forward to catching up.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.625
Thank you. Have a good night.

34:29.666 --> 34:31.375
Get that nose bleed looked at.

34:31.416 --> 34:32.833
Yes, sir.

34:42.208 --> 34:44.583
Your old man's a cop, huh?

34:44.625 --> 34:46.416
No, far from it.

34:46.458 --> 34:49.083
He's just an old drinking buddy.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.875
Fucking small town.

35:12.875 --> 35:16.166
Dad used to take me
and my brother here.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.708
Used to have this roller-coaster
called the Crusher.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.583
So fun, man.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.375
We'd wait hours
just to get 30 seconds on it.

35:23.416 --> 35:25.000
So worth it.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.291
He'd leave us there all day.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.916
There was a dog track
about a mile from here.

35:32.166 --> 35:34.708
Never knew what mood
he was gonna be in

35:34.750 --> 35:36.083
when he picked us up.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.333
Is he still around?

35:39.375 --> 35:42.458
Fuck if I know. It's been
years since I've seen him.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.916
Hm.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.500
Probably drank himself to death.

35:46.958 --> 35:48.375
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

35:51.333 --> 35:55.000
The way I figured it
is I can end up just like him,

35:55.041 --> 35:58.208
you know, the way
everyone expects,

35:58.250 --> 36:00.458
or I could say,
"Fuck that shit,"

36:00.500 --> 36:03.500
do my own thing, do it better,

36:03.541 --> 36:05.000
simple as that.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.291
No, I know.
Look who's talking, right?

36:09.333 --> 36:11.791
But all this, everything
I'm up to right now is...

36:13.041 --> 36:15.166
...so Hayley has
a better shot, you know?

36:17.166 --> 36:19.416
'Cause she ain't never gonna
forget what I look like.

36:21.458 --> 36:23.125
That's for fucking sure.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.166
That your wife?

36:35.208 --> 36:36.708
- Yeah.

36:38.041 --> 36:40.000
She's not happy
when I'm running late.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.250
Fuck, I know that feeling.

36:45.791 --> 36:48.458
You know it's not fair, right?

36:48.500 --> 36:53.250
You know my name now
and I don't know yours.

36:53.291 --> 36:56.208
Would it kill you just
to call yourself John

36:56.250 --> 37:00.166
or Ryan or anything?

37:00.208 --> 37:04.541
Yeah, it's John Ryan.
Good guess, actually.

37:13.250 --> 37:14.958
Didn't these guys
pass us before?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.208
Yeah, I think so.

37:51.666 --> 37:53.083
Fuck.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.500
Shit. He's coming up on us.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.000
Holy shit, he's got a gun!

37:58.041 --> 37:59.625
Pull over!
Fuck!

38:02.000 --> 38:04.125
Get up.

38:18.041 --> 38:19.666
Why are they trying to kill us?

38:38.916 --> 38:40.791
- Shit! I'm empty.

38:40.833 --> 38:42.833
Check... check the glove box.

38:42.875 --> 38:44.791
I got you, I got you.

38:44.833 --> 38:47.791
No, no, no! Shit!
It's empty too, man.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.833
There's nothing else. Shit!

38:52.916 --> 38:54.416
We're good in here, right?

38:58.708 --> 39:00.166
Where are those guys?

39:08.333 --> 39:10.333
Come on.

39:10.375 --> 39:12.166
Let's go.

39:15.708 --> 39:17.166
There's no route this way!

39:21.750 --> 39:24.125
Shit!

39:24.166 --> 39:26.041
What? What? What?
Keep it going, man!

39:26.083 --> 39:28.416
Shit.

39:28.458 --> 39:30.041
Fuck.

39:33.250 --> 39:35.458
This can't be the plan,
man, right?

39:35.500 --> 39:37.291
I mean, can't we, like,
run them over or something?

39:38.666 --> 39:40.791
- Put your hands out the window.
What?

39:40.833 --> 39:43.291
Just put your hands
out the fucking window!

39:46.083 --> 39:48.000
Put your hands
where I can see them.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.958
And move slowly towards me.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.666
I can't die, man.
I can't fucking die.

39:55.708 --> 39:57.500
I c...

39:57.541 --> 39:59.625
Just be cool and get out.

40:07.958 --> 40:10.125
Come on, slowly.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.041
Good.

40:15.083 --> 40:18.958
You, roll down your sleeves.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.833
What?

40:20.875 --> 40:23.875
I said pull down
your fucking sleeves!

40:30.250 --> 40:31.666
We got you.

40:34.958 --> 40:37.125
We fucking got you.

40:41.583 --> 40:42.708
Shit.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.166
We got him!

41:01.625 --> 41:02.833
You're not so fucking tough

41:02.875 --> 41:04.000
without your fucking
shotgun, are you?

41:04.041 --> 41:06.875
Fuck, here we go.

41:06.916 --> 41:08.625
Yeah.

41:10.583 --> 41:11.916
Is that him?

41:17.750 --> 41:19.458
Say something.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.375
What do you want me to say?

41:25.625 --> 41:27.125
Tell me you're gonna...

41:28.125 --> 41:30.250
...blow my fucking head off.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.416
Say it.

41:33.666 --> 41:36.458
I'm gonna blow your
fucking head off.

41:39.541 --> 41:41.916
It's not him, man. It's not him.

41:42.916 --> 41:44.416
He's just the driver, man.

41:44.458 --> 41:48.458
I was there, I can tell you
that's not him.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.625
I don't know the guy's name,
who you're looking for,

41:50.666 --> 41:53.875
but I can tell you
we had no idea

41:53.916 --> 41:56.250
he was gonna pull that
fucking shit out, OK?

41:59.958 --> 42:03.333
What about you?
You know his name?

42:03.375 --> 42:05.125
No.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.125
What about my money?

42:09.166 --> 42:11.208
You know what happened
to my money?

42:11.250 --> 42:14.125
No, they don't tell me
that shit. I'm the driver.

42:14.166 --> 42:15.500
Hmm.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.208
You don't have
a lot to say, do you?

42:26.333 --> 42:28.666
What if I gouge
your fucking eyes out?

42:28.708 --> 42:30.041
Will you talk then?

42:33.750 --> 42:35.833
Oh, look at that.
Maybe you got a wife.

42:35.875 --> 42:37.958
Maybe I should pay
her a call, huh?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.583
You fucking...

42:39.625 --> 42:42.875
You, get down on your
fucking hands and knees.

42:42.916 --> 42:44.166
Get down on
your fucking knees.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.541
The fuck you looking here for?

42:45.583 --> 42:47.000
Get on your fucking knees!

42:47.041 --> 42:49.166
Can... can we please
talk about this?

42:49.208 --> 42:51.125
Hmm, OK.

42:52.125 --> 42:54.625
I had a little...

42:54.666 --> 42:58.041
...I had a little
head injury recently

42:58.083 --> 43:01.375
so I wanna be quite sure
I got this clear.

43:02.625 --> 43:04.083
You don't have my money,

43:04.125 --> 43:06.083
don't know the name of the guy

43:06.125 --> 43:08.625
that turned my head
into a fucking piñata.

43:08.666 --> 43:11.708
We can figure that out.
We can find the guy.

43:11.750 --> 43:14.750
We can find his name,
give you the money, all that.

43:14.791 --> 43:17.875
- But if you kill us...
- If I kill you?

43:17.916 --> 43:19.458
If I kill you?

43:20.958 --> 43:23.083
I thought I made it clear

43:23.125 --> 43:27.750
that nobody steals from me
and gets to live.

43:27.791 --> 43:29.916
Nobody? What about him?

43:29.958 --> 43:32.416
The fuck you talking about?

43:32.458 --> 43:35.958
Is he the exception,
this piece of shit, huh?

43:36.000 --> 43:38.083
Why don't you ask your boy

43:38.125 --> 43:39.750
how they knew what
was in the safe, Frank.

43:39.791 --> 43:41.583
- Shut the fuck up!
- Huh? Go ahead, Frank.

43:41.625 --> 43:43.416
Ask him about his deal.

43:43.458 --> 43:45.250
- Dad, he's a fucking liar.
- Why don't you tell him, Shaun?

43:45.291 --> 43:47.333
How much of the cut
had your name on it?

43:47.375 --> 43:48.708
- Don't listen to this shit!
- I'm guessing half.

43:48.750 --> 43:50.083
- Think it was half?
- Shut the fuck up!

43:50.125 --> 43:52.041
- I'm thinking half.
- Shut the fuck up.

43:53.041 --> 43:56.166
You fucked me over?

43:56.208 --> 43:59.041
No. No, no, no.
It's not like that.

43:59.083 --> 44:01.083
- It's not.
- Don't you lie to me.

44:01.125 --> 44:03.541
- I'm not.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

44:04.791 --> 44:06.500
You fucking weasel.

44:06.541 --> 44:08.208
My own son.

44:09.541 --> 44:11.333
You piece of shit.

44:18.500 --> 44:21.750
You should have...
you should have killed me.

44:21.791 --> 44:24.666
You should have
fucking killed me!

44:24.708 --> 44:27.208
I didn't want to fucking
kill you, alright?

44:27.250 --> 44:29.625
That was the fucking deal!
You fucked it up!

44:29.666 --> 44:31.083
Why'd you say
you wanted him dead?

44:31.125 --> 44:32.208
- I didn't fucking say that.
- Bullshit!

44:32.250 --> 44:33.666
You said you wanted him dead.

44:33.708 --> 44:35.500
You shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up!

44:35.541 --> 44:37.833
-"Kill him and take it all."
- Stop fucking lying!

44:37.875 --> 44:41.083
Hey, I heard,
"Kill him, take it all.".

44:41.125 --> 44:42.708
That's what I heard, Frank.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.500
- He said...
- Fuck!

44:45.750 --> 44:47.500
- Alright.
Hey!

44:47.541 --> 44:49.166
Fuck!

44:50.541 --> 44:53.500
Now, we kill these fucks

44:53.541 --> 44:56.875
and then we talk.

45:02.958 --> 45:04.583
Dad, hold him!

45:10.125 --> 45:11.416
Ugh!

45:41.416 --> 45:42.750
Ugh!

46:22.000 --> 46:23.625
You did good.

47:29.333 --> 47:30.541
Oh...

48:25.125 --> 48:27.583
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

48:27.625 --> 48:29.375
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on?

48:30.625 --> 48:31.791
- Hey, hey.

48:31.833 --> 48:33.583
What's going on? You alright?

48:33.625 --> 48:36.625
I can't...

48:36.666 --> 48:39.083
- Huh? What?
- I can't... I can't breathe.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.875
Just sit back,
sit back, sit back.

48:40.916 --> 48:42.291
- I need my inhaler.
- Hey, hey, hey.

48:42.333 --> 48:43.833
Listen to me, listen to me.

48:43.875 --> 48:45.041
- I need my inhaler.
- Just breathe, breathe.

48:45.083 --> 48:47.250
- I can't...
- Just take a breath.

48:47.291 --> 48:49.416
- Take a breath, take a breath.

48:49.458 --> 48:51.958
- Hey, hey, just... just relax.
- I need my inhaler.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.500
I can't...

48:53.541 --> 48:55.625
Where the fuck is it?

48:55.666 --> 48:57.333
I need it.

48:57.375 --> 48:59.291
Hey, calm down, calm down.

48:59.333 --> 49:01.958
Just breathe, breathe,
alright? Just relax.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.750
Alright, just... Hey, hey.

49:03.791 --> 49:05.166
Think about
your daughter, alright?

49:05.208 --> 49:06.708
It's Hayley, yeah?

49:09.500 --> 49:11.666
I remember you saying that
because that's my sister's name.

49:11.708 --> 49:13.458
Hayley, it's a pretty name.

49:13.500 --> 49:16.416
- Just relax, OK?

49:16.458 --> 49:18.041
Just breathe.

49:22.625 --> 49:24.041
Just breathe.

49:28.875 --> 49:31.708
- Calm down.

49:35.458 --> 49:37.083
You OK?

49:42.083 --> 49:44.708
Man... I can't have you
dying in here.

49:44.750 --> 49:47.333
This is my father's car.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.166
This was his pride and joy.

49:50.541 --> 49:52.250
You OK?

49:59.916 --> 50:01.083
Can you tell me about him?

50:02.333 --> 50:03.958
Yeah, he was nice.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.875
Kinda too nice, you know?

50:08.041 --> 50:09.916
That was his weakness.

50:09.958 --> 50:11.916
He always saw
the best in everyone.

50:13.958 --> 50:15.750
That doesn't
sound like a weakness.

50:17.458 --> 50:20.333
Well, people are assholes.
You know, they take advantage.

50:21.583 --> 50:24.541
He'd go out of his
way to help everyone,

50:24.583 --> 50:26.416
spread himself too thin.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.750
It nearly cost him his marriage.

50:33.916 --> 50:36.541
I remember when I went
away for a few years,

50:36.583 --> 50:38.875
I asked him not to,
but he would...

50:38.916 --> 50:42.791
...he would drive five hours
round trip every weekend

50:42.833 --> 50:46.416
for a 20-minute visitation,
every weekend.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.458
And he had every reason to
look at me like a piece of shit,

50:53.500 --> 50:55.041
but he never did.

50:56.958 --> 50:58.958
He just kept me going.

51:00.916 --> 51:02.791
Yeah, well...

51:02.833 --> 51:05.000
The rest of my family
wasn't so kind.

51:06.458 --> 51:08.916
Anyway, this is all
I got left of him.

51:11.750 --> 51:14.375
So don't slam the doors.

51:20.041 --> 51:21.500
You alright?

51:23.250 --> 51:24.458
Yeah.

51:26.208 --> 51:27.583
I'm alright.

51:28.958 --> 51:30.958
They were gonna kill us.
You know that, right?

51:32.208 --> 51:33.750
There's nothing
we could have said.

51:37.083 --> 51:39.041
You did the right thing.

51:39.083 --> 51:42.000
If you didn't do what you did,

51:42.041 --> 51:44.916
we'd both be laying down
out there face down right now

51:44.958 --> 51:47.000
instead of them.

51:48.416 --> 51:49.833
OK?

51:54.458 --> 51:55.791
I gotta make a phone call,

51:55.833 --> 51:57.541
let them know
we're gonna be late.

51:57.583 --> 51:59.833
- Just relax, keep breathing.

52:16.333 --> 52:18.291
<i>Alright, smart-ass,
where the fuck are you?</i>

52:18.333 --> 52:21.250
You put her on. No more
fucking around. Put her on!

52:21.291 --> 52:23.708
<i>Oh, this better be good.</i>

52:23.750 --> 52:25.875
<i>- Yeah, he's on.</i>
<i>You're late.</i>

52:25.916 --> 52:28.000
Did you know Frank
was still alive?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.416
<i>- What?</i>
- Well, he was.

52:32.791 --> 52:34.166
I don't know how
they tracked us down,

52:34.208 --> 52:37.000
but this shit didn't end well.

52:37.041 --> 52:39.833
<i>This mess keeps getting worse.</i>

52:39.875 --> 52:41.666
None of this shit
would have happened

52:41.708 --> 52:45.250
if Leon hadn't acted
like a goddamn maniac.

52:45.291 --> 52:48.333
And now Shaun is dead,
he doesn't need his cut.

52:48.375 --> 52:52.125
So who gives a shit
about a missing 25 grand?

52:52.166 --> 52:54.208
Why can't we just call this?

52:54.250 --> 52:55.916
<i>Are you telling me
how to run things?</i>

52:55.958 --> 52:57.875
<i>Is that what you do now?</i>

52:57.916 --> 53:01.291
<i>Do me a favour. Don't forget
who you're talking to.</i>

53:01.333 --> 53:03.166
Listen, I understand.
It's just that...

53:04.416 --> 53:07.458
This kid,
he handled himself well.

53:08.708 --> 53:10.750
He had my back. He was great.

53:12.125 --> 53:13.750
Can't we just call this?

53:15.000 --> 53:18.375
<i>Bring him to me.
I just wanna talk to him.</i>

53:18.416 --> 53:20.083
<i>Turn up without him</i>

53:20.125 --> 53:22.458
<i>and you're gonna wish
that Frank had killed you.</i>

54:05.875 --> 54:07.458
I found your thing.

54:09.083 --> 54:10.375
Thanks.

54:10.416 --> 54:12.166
Where'd you get that?

54:13.416 --> 54:16.625
- You going through my shit?
- No, it fell out.

54:21.375 --> 54:22.625
This your son?

54:23.583 --> 54:25.208
Yeah.

54:26.708 --> 54:30.708
What's he, like... seven, eight?

54:33.541 --> 54:35.541
No, he's about 15 now.

54:37.125 --> 54:39.208
- 15?
- Mm-hm.

54:43.458 --> 54:44.750
Hey.

54:46.750 --> 54:49.375
Hmm.

54:49.416 --> 54:50.875
Wow.

54:53.041 --> 54:55.916
Hey, uh, I just...

54:58.333 --> 54:59.625
...wanna say thanks for...

55:03.958 --> 55:05.541
...helping me breathe there.

55:07.541 --> 55:09.875
- Yep.
- Thanks.

55:51.250 --> 55:52.750
Yeah, we just landed.
They're headed your way.

55:52.791 --> 55:55.208
He's gonna need stitching up.

55:55.250 --> 55:57.125
I'll deal with the car.

56:01.625 --> 56:03.458
Jesus fucking Christ!

56:04.708 --> 56:07.166
What are we gonna do
about that shit, huh?!

56:07.208 --> 56:09.208
Keep your voice down.
Help him out.

56:15.041 --> 56:16.666
Don't you
fucking touch me.

56:16.708 --> 56:18.125
Let's go.

56:20.333 --> 56:22.416
You got two minutes
to get to the pickup.

56:22.458 --> 56:24.041
I got it, I got it.

57:07.666 --> 57:09.500
Do you still take
your kid fishing?

57:10.750 --> 57:12.875
Yeah, from time to time.

57:15.416 --> 57:19.500
Yeah, I mean, I used
to go up... Mill Creek.

57:19.541 --> 57:21.041
There's some good
carp over there.

57:23.625 --> 57:26.750
My dad was the only one
that caught the fish, though.

57:27.875 --> 57:29.375
I'd hold the camera.

57:32.875 --> 57:34.833
We'd go out, like,
every Sunday morning.

57:36.125 --> 57:38.625
He'd show up at the door

57:38.666 --> 57:40.708
in this shitty car...

57:42.541 --> 57:44.416
...honking a mile away.

57:49.291 --> 57:50.833
He was always late.

57:52.708 --> 57:54.083
Huh.

57:55.708 --> 57:57.541
One day I was
sitting in the driveway

57:57.583 --> 57:58.958
a little longer than usual.

58:00.791 --> 58:02.708
An hour goes by.

58:04.458 --> 58:06.000
Another hour.

58:08.333 --> 58:10.833
And I just knew
he wasn't gonna show up.

58:14.833 --> 58:16.416
And he didn't...

58:18.625 --> 58:20.375
...12 years ago.

58:26.958 --> 58:28.666
Who fucking just disappears

58:28.708 --> 58:31.708
on their kid like that,
you know?

58:35.083 --> 58:37.708
I'm gonna take Hayley,

58:37.750 --> 58:39.583
go make some new memories,

58:39.625 --> 58:41.541
pave right over the old ones.

58:44.041 --> 58:46.125
<i>Ad Meliora.</i>

58:48.625 --> 58:51.833
Latin or some shit.
It means 'new beginnings'.

58:51.875 --> 58:54.625
My mom had it tatted on her arm.

58:58.250 --> 59:00.041
She probably didn't
even know what it meant.

59:03.708 --> 59:06.500
I liked it.
It gave me hope, you know?

59:06.541 --> 59:08.250
Made me think of a new future.

59:10.291 --> 59:13.041
Yeah, I think it's,
<i>"Semper ad meliora."</i>

59:14.125 --> 59:15.791
"Towards better things."

59:16.791 --> 59:18.166
It's nice.

59:21.750 --> 59:23.750
"Towards better things."

59:28.000 --> 59:30.708
What else is your kid into?

59:30.750 --> 59:32.750
He's a teenager.

59:32.791 --> 59:34.333
He likes to drive fast.

59:35.583 --> 59:37.416
I take him out
in this sometimes.

59:39.166 --> 59:40.708
This will be his one day.

59:41.708 --> 59:45.000
Ah, lucky him.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.625
It's a nice car to learn in.

59:49.666 --> 59:51.625
Be careful, though.

59:51.666 --> 59:55.541
He's gonna be stealing your keys
and taking those girls out soon.

59:57.500 --> 59:59.208
Is he already doing that?

01:00:04.916 --> 01:00:06.708
Oh, man, I am not
looking forward

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:08.166
to Hayley being that age.

01:00:10.166 --> 01:00:13.250
Stuff I was doing at 15? Mn-mn.

01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:17.833
I'm gonna be scaring off
every asshole

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.333
that comes knocking, man.

01:00:22.541 --> 01:00:25.583
Patting my hand with
a baseball bat, redneck style.

01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:30.083
Ain't nobody's
good enough for her.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:37.958
Not in this town anyway.

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:56.250
I just hope she never
finds out I killed somebody.

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:58.041
At least that's for sure.

01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:07.791
So much for Batman.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.708
Where would you go?

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:38.166
What?

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:41.041
Where would you go?

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:42.583
You said you wanted
to get out of here.

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:46.875
Start a better life
with you and your daughter.

01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:50.041
Where would you go?

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:57.041
I don't think
I'm supposed to tell you that.

01:01:57.083 --> 01:01:59.166
See, I'm catching on.

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:01.958
Just forget
all that shit, alright?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.958
Have you got someplace
where you got family?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.666
Someplace you can go?

01:02:06.916 --> 01:02:10.000
Anywhere you... you could go
if you had to?

01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:15.291
Man, you've gotta be thinking
about your next move, alright?

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:17.708
What are you talking about?

01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:20.833
Hey, we've gotta go, man.

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:22.208
- You've got a green.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.541
You OK?

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:44.125
Yo!

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.458
You lost?

01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:51.958
Oh, this joker.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
After you.

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:59.000
Glad to see he made
a quick recovery.

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.625
Fucking ass.

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:34.583
Fuck it.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.916
Nice place.

01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:52.625
Phew!

01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:57.166
Alright?

01:05:02.416 --> 01:05:03.750
She's waiting.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.333
Better make a run for it.

01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:10.875
Hey, hey...

01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:25.041
She ain't happy.

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:29.125
Alright, hold up, gentlemen.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:37.875
- Come on.

01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:40.083
- Easy, asshole.
- Whoa. Sorry.

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.958
Got a boo-boo there, princess?

01:05:43.125 --> 01:05:44.708
OK.

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.875
You, come on. Spread them, kid.

01:05:51.375 --> 01:05:52.791
Alright.

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:55.000
What the fuck is this?

01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:57.708
- It's my inhaler.
- He needs it.

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.083
Right.

01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.083
Come on.

01:06:13.666 --> 01:06:15.166
Alright.

01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:17.791
The fuck happened to you?

01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:22.125
Come on. You're late.

01:06:22.166 --> 01:06:24.541
You know that pisses
her off, right?

01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:30.250
Jimmy, nice work
on the Highland job.

01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:32.000
Cheers, boss.
- Don't fuck up the next one.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.958
Oi, back to work, motherfucker!

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.416
Yeah, yeah, I'm doing it.

01:06:36.458 --> 01:06:39.041
Fuck me. Amateurs.

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.875
And what part of that
is my fucking problem?

01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:45.625
If you did your job
in the first place,

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.000
he wouldn't be sitting
in a jail cell

01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:48.625
right now ready to talk.

01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:50.291
Just finish what you started.

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:52.916
Morons.

01:06:54.666 --> 01:06:56.666
You made it!

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.375
Hell of a night.

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:04.583
We've not met.

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.583
You know who I am?

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:10.083
Yeah. I mean, yes, ma'am.

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:13.166
Good. Tanner had a lot
to say about you.

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:16.958
I only work with people
who come recommended.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.375
Must be nice to finally
make some real money.

01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:23.666
Yeah, very thankful
for the, uh, opportunities.

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:25.666
Yeah, well,
you held yourself well.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:29.458
You keep doing what you're
doing and you'll go places.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.000
Thanks.

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:35.583
You had an eventful
journey, I hear.

01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:37.916
Oh, it was eventful.

01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.333
Any idea how they found us?

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:44.333
No, this town has some
big mouths. You know that.

01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:47.750
So you killed Shaun?

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:53.041
- Yeah, he did good.
- Yeah.

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:56.791
Yeah, well,
better off without him.

01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:58.833
He sold out his own father
for what? 200?

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:01.583
Daddy issues, I'm sure.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:04.208
Probably just wanted to see him
taken down a peg.

01:08:09.916 --> 01:08:11.750
You know...

01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:16.875
...that conscience of yours
is gonna get you nowhere.

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:23.916
You like spiders?

01:08:23.958 --> 01:08:26.333
No, actually.

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:30.333
It's a stupid
face-your-fears kind of thing.

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.291
My daughter actually
makes me wear long sleeves.

01:08:32.333 --> 01:08:33.750
- I'll probably change it.
- Yeah.

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:36.250
What would you get?

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.291
I don't know.
I was thinking maybe an eagle.

01:08:41.333 --> 01:08:43.958
Oh, bird of prey!

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.291
Yeah, not afraid of birds, then?

01:08:46.333 --> 01:08:49.291
- Not birds.
- Nah, beautiful creatures.

01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:51.250
So many different species,

01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:54.666
each with their own
unique characteristics.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.291
A bird in nature,

01:08:57.333 --> 01:09:00.791
now, that is the ultimate
symbol of freedom.

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:04.708
Well, let me ask you something.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.125
One suddenly
flies into your home

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:09.333
and starts squawking at you
from the kitchen counter.

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:10.750
What do you do?

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:16.083
You lose your fucking mind.
That's what!

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.583
You leave the room,
you lock the door,

01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:20.375
you panic, they panic.

01:09:20.416 --> 01:09:23.000
They become unpredictable

01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:26.083
because it's not their habitat.

01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:29.583
It's not where they belong.

01:09:31.583 --> 01:09:33.250
So let me ask you...

01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:37.125
...is this where you belong

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:39.916
or are you unpredictable?

01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:51.500
No, I...I belong.

01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:54.458
I mean, I think this is...

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.083
I'm just fucking with you.
I do with all the new recruits.

01:09:58.125 --> 01:10:01.208
Alright, let's get down to it.
75 each.

01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:07.250
And 50 for the recruit.

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.291
Thanks.

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:20.958
Hey, new guy.

01:10:23.791 --> 01:10:25.500
Aren't you gonna count it?

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:30.791
- I'm good. I trust you guys.
Oh, come on.

01:10:30.833 --> 01:10:33.041
It's our first time
working together.

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:35.791
Let me give you
a word of advice.

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:38.000
Never be too polite
to count your take.

01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:43.333
- I mean, it's... it's no problem.
- There should be 50 in there.

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:47.458
Go ahead. Count. You earned it.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:51.416
If that's OK with you?

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.375
No, I insist.

01:11:10.375 --> 01:11:11.875
There's only 25 in here.

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:15.166
25? Not 50?

01:11:16.958 --> 01:11:20.416
Yeah, I mean,
I counted it twice.

01:11:20.458 --> 01:11:23.791
Oh, that's right. I gave you
an advance on that 25.

01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:27.208
You know, that money,

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:29.458
probably been spending
all around town.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.875
It could be traceable.

01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.666
You see, we have a process here

01:11:32.708 --> 01:11:35.250
and you fucked up that process.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:38.625
What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

01:11:38.666 --> 01:11:42.125
What you looking at him for?
He's not gonna help you.

01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:46.666
I didn't steal
any fucking money.

01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:48.583
I'm not that stupid, OK?

01:11:48.625 --> 01:11:51.000
I would never do that
to you guys, alright?

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.916
I wouldn't, OK?
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:56.541
I mean, fuck, I would
never fucking steal...

01:11:56.583 --> 01:11:58.583
- Hey, get off him!

01:11:58.625 --> 01:11:59.708
Get off him!

01:12:01.708 --> 01:12:03.166
Get the fuck off him.

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:05.041
You don't know what
was in Frank's safe!

01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:08.125
You weren't there.
You don't know.

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.458
Get him up.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.541
You gonna trust Shaun
over the kid?

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:18.083
Let him up!
He said he didn't do it!

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:25.333
.

01:12:28.666 --> 01:12:30.208
He can't breathe.

01:12:31.791 --> 01:12:33.250
He can't breathe.
Give him his pipe.

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:34.958
This?

01:12:38.541 --> 01:12:40.208
He can't breathe!

01:12:42.583 --> 01:12:44.458
Let him up!

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.125
Please...

01:12:48.291 --> 01:12:49.541
Get off him!

01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:51.833
I can't die, man.

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:53.750
Let him up! Oh!

01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:56.500
Take the money from my cut!

01:12:56.541 --> 01:12:58.625
- Fuck, get off of him!

01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:00.041
Get off him!

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.625
Enough!

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:05.458
Just listen to him.
Just let him talk.

01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:11.083
Leon.

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:13.125
Leon, stay the fuck out of it.

01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:15.166
He fucked
you over too.

01:13:16.583 --> 01:13:17.958
You do the honours.

01:13:19.208 --> 01:13:22.541
Leon, stay the fuck
out of it. Leon!

01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:27.125
Oh! Oh, fuck!

01:13:27.166 --> 01:13:29.166
What the fuck, man?!

01:13:29.208 --> 01:13:31.458
"No-one gets hurt," I said.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.291
I'm putting out fires here
and you're starting new ones.

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.666
Frank was holding money
for a lot of people.

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:38.083
If anyone finds out about

01:13:38.125 --> 01:13:39.583
my part in this thing,
you started a war...

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:41.083
I'm sorry.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.375
...a war you won't
be around to see.

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:45.125
No, please!

01:13:55.875 --> 01:13:58.125
Help, please!

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.416
You know, you're alright.

01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:13.625
You're a thieving piece of shit,
but I kinda like you.

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:16.000
He said
he didn't take it.

01:14:16.041 --> 01:14:18.583
You could've made
some serious money,

01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:20.375
but you got greedy.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.083
You see, my business
is built on trust.

01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:27.916
And if I can't trust you...

01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:31.166
Oh, fuck.

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:34.166
I can't leave her.
I can't leave her!

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:36.041
...then you're fuckin'
dead to me.

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:40.166
Fuck! Oh!

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:04.750
Now, you wanna die tonight
or you wanna get paid?

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:07.125
You vindictive bitch.

01:15:10.666 --> 01:15:12.875
Alright, back off him.

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:22.083
Keep that phone on you.
I'll be in touch.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:31.000
Take it.

01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:47.458
Alright, I want
those bodies moved.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.791
I want the bikes ditched.

01:17:12.541 --> 01:17:13.958
Hey!

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:19.000
Going somewhere?

01:17:31.833 --> 01:17:33.625
- Fuck.

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.083
Fuck! Fuck!

01:18:18.625 --> 01:18:19.791
Huh!

01:18:42.666 --> 01:18:44.750
You wanna fucking dance?

01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:06.458
Fuck!

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:11.083
Arggh!

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.125
Fuck you!

01:19:23.166 --> 01:19:24.708
- Ugh!

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.833
Oh, fuck!

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.833
<i>It feels
like you've been avoiding me...</i>

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:42.458
<i>...been avoiding me...</i>

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.916
<i>Hey, Eric.</i>

01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:46.916
<i>My buddy here's a driver too.</i>

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:50.708
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:52.208
<i>Tell Eric where we're heading.</i>

01:20:53.208 --> 01:20:55.000
<i>I don't have it, Janko.</i>

01:20:55.041 --> 01:20:57.000
<i>I need more time.</i>

01:20:57.041 --> 01:20:59.208
<i>There's a job I can take
in a couple of weeks.</i>

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.166
<i>I just need time
to clean the money.</i>

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:04.458
<i>You got two minutes
to get to the pickup.</i>

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.666
<i>I got it, I got it.</i>

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:11.625
<i>For old times' sake,
next time we meet,</i>

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.500
<i>you better have my cash.</i>

01:21:22.541 --> 01:21:24.333
You just gonna let him go?

01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:27.458
No, I just wanted him
to hurt a little bit longer.

01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.041
<i>Remember... remember...</i>

01:21:31.083 --> 01:21:33.125
<i>...you always have more to lose.</i>

01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:36.708
<i>Say hi to your boy for me.</i>

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.291
Oh, fuck!

01:21:55.333 --> 01:21:58.041
Fuck.

01:22:16.916 --> 01:22:20.791
Oh, fuck!

01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:51.333
OK.

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:03.000
Yeah, it's done.

01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:05.625
<i>What about the money?</i>

01:24:05.666 --> 01:24:07.291
Oh, shit. Yeah, hang on.

01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:10.541
Get the fuck out.

01:24:13.583 --> 01:24:15.333
Yeah, it's all there.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.458
<i>Hello?</i>

01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:42.625
<i>Still with me?</i>

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.291
<i>You're still breathing.
Good for you.</i>

01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:53.041
You know, you should
have come to me

01:24:53.083 --> 01:24:54.708
about your debt with Janko.

01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:57.791
I would have given you
the money, no questions asked.

01:24:57.833 --> 01:25:00.375
<i>But did you really think
you could steal from me?</i>

01:25:00.416 --> 01:25:02.958
If you knew it was me,
why would you kill him?

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.708
Huh? Why did you kill the kid?!

01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:07.750
I killed him?

01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:09.916
You knew what was
waiting for him.

01:25:09.958 --> 01:25:12.375
You had plenty of chances
to come forward.

01:25:12.416 --> 01:25:16.291
<i>I read people.
That's how I got to where I am.</i>

01:25:16.333 --> 01:25:18.625
<i>The kid was soft.
You saw it yourself.</i>

01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:20.583
Oh, he was fine
running drugs for Tanner

01:25:20.625 --> 01:25:22.250
and all that
small-time bullshit,

01:25:22.291 --> 01:25:24.666
but he would have caved,

01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:26.250
gone running to the cops

01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:27.875
or gotten someone killed

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:30.083
for not doing what it takes
to get shit done.

01:25:31.333 --> 01:25:34.833
<i>But you, you are the one person</i>

01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:37.083
<i>I've never been able to read.</i>

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:42.208
Your wife, she gets mowed down,

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.083
left for dead by some
low-life crack whore

01:25:44.125 --> 01:25:46.333
and you don't do shit about it.

01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.916
Don't talk about my wife.

01:25:51.958 --> 01:25:55.041
I tracked her down for you.

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:57.750
I gifted her to you
on a fucking plate.

01:25:58.833 --> 01:26:00.833
So much rage behind the eyes.

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:04.000
<i>But you couldn't unleash it.</i>

01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:06.708
Instead, you begged me
to let her go!

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:09.625
Yeah.

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:13.250
I never understood you.

01:26:13.291 --> 01:26:17.291
<i>But now I see
exactly who you are.</i>

01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:20.333
<i>You are fucking cold.</i>

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:23.458
And now you got
that kid's blood on your hands.

01:26:26.416 --> 01:26:28.375
Now, it's been a long night,

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:33.375
so I'll spare you the big speech
about hunting you down.

01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:36.166
<i>You know how this ends.</i>

01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:38.166
Yeah, I know how it works.

01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:40.416
I know your every movement.

01:26:40.458 --> 01:26:43.041
I know everybody
you've fucked over.

01:26:43.083 --> 01:26:45.208
This whole town's
gonna know soon.

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:48.708
You're living on
borrowed time, lady,

01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:50.666
so you better find me.

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:53.666
You won't make it
through the night.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.416
You got nowhere to go.

01:26:56.458 --> 01:26:58.458
You better kill me quick.

01:27:30.416 --> 01:27:31.875
Fuck!

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.041
Fuck!

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.541
<i>This is Officer Morales.</i>

01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:21.500
<i>- Hello?</i>
- The kid is dead.

01:28:22.541 --> 01:28:24.208
<i>What?</i>

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:27.250
The old auto shop in Wyevale.

01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:30.666
<i>OK, slow down. Who's dead?
What's going on?</i>

01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:36.375
The kid, Jake. He's dead.

01:28:36.416 --> 01:28:38.458
<i>We're gonna dispatch
a unit to that location.</i>

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.166
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:30:24.583 --> 01:30:27.833
