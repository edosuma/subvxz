Wake up.

PARAMOUNT PICTURES

01:21.749 --> 01:24.319
Come along, faithful viewers,

01:24.352 --> 01:28.392
on our journey
through the drainforest

01:28.422 --> 01:32.532
as we search
for that very unusable creature,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.860
the three-toed sloth.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.728
Ah, there he is!

01:38.766 --> 01:40.326
Teething with life.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.638
Let's get a closer look,
shall we?

01:42.670 --> 01:44.570
Oh, no, you don't!

01:44.605 --> 01:45.765
Cut! Cut!

01:45.806 --> 01:47.306
Don't worry, Chuckie.

01:47.341 --> 01:51.711
I'm Nigel Strawberry,
wild aminal expert.

01:52.913 --> 01:56.223
And 'cause
I'm an eggsbert, I say,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.620
everybody into the truck!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.188
Go, go, go.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.233
Jump Tommy, jump!

02:05.259 --> 02:06.589
Say something, Nigel.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.526
I can hear the tiger's
running feets,

02:09.562 --> 02:11.873
see his sharp teeths,

02:11.899 --> 02:15.639
and oh, oh...
I feel a cool breeze.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.915
Croca-gator!

02:38.826 --> 02:40.926
Not to worry, guys!

02:49.303 --> 02:52.313
Oh, no! It's coming back!

02:52.340 --> 02:53.840
But that was my onliest
cute toy!

02:53.874 --> 02:56.784
Then feed him Phil.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.710
I heard that.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.275
That way! Through the swamp!

03:03.717 --> 03:06.417
Nigel, why are we sinking?

03:06.454 --> 03:08.964
Quitsand! I should
have knowed!

03:08.989 --> 03:10.889
Guys, hang on to me!

03:19.667 --> 03:22.297
What are you diaperbags
screaming about?

03:22.336 --> 03:23.536
We're about
to get eated

03:23.571 --> 03:25.971
by that ferocious
Siferean tiger.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.606
Were you pretending
to be Nigel Strawberry

03:29.643 --> 03:30.813
again, Tommy?

03:30.844 --> 03:31.814
Yeah. He's my hero,

03:31.845 --> 03:35.445
and when I grow up,
I want to be just like him.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.353
Pickles,
you're no Nigel Strawberry.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.885
You're not even a Nigel...

03:40.921 --> 03:41.961
...Raspberry!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.989
You're never gonna have
real adventures.

03:44.024 --> 03:48.564
You're just a backyard baby
with a diaper full of dreams.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.301
Wow. She's mean.

03:52.333 --> 03:56.003
Now, who wants to go look
for cookies under stuff?

03:56.036 --> 03:56.866
I do!

03:56.904 --> 03:58.944
Okay, come on.
Follow me.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.747
The panthera onca,

04:08.782 --> 04:12.392
commonly known as the jaguar,
seems determined

04:12.420 --> 04:14.890
to feast on my nether regions.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.291
But not to worry.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.533
Well, faithful viewers,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.631
our journey was
a smashing success.

04:25.299 --> 04:28.369
Until next time,
this is Sir Nigel Thornberry

04:28.402 --> 04:32.812
of Sir Nigel Thornberry's
Animal World.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.840
Back! Back! Back!

04:34.875 --> 04:36.935
Why, hello, Scout.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.977
Boy, rest your eyes
for a second,

04:39.012 --> 04:41.082
at old Thornberry's
gator bait.

04:41.114 --> 04:41.984
Hey.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.320
Boy, that Sir Nigel gets
in some real scrapes

04:45.353 --> 04:48.393
out there in the wild,
but he always manages

04:48.422 --> 04:51.832
to wiggle out of trouble
somehow.

04:53.927 --> 04:54.927
Oh, and, Jonathan, don't think

04:54.962 --> 04:57.932
that just because I'm on
a Luxury Lipschitz Cruise

04:57.965 --> 04:59.025
in the South China Seas,

04:59.066 --> 05:01.066
I won't be
checking messages,

05:01.101 --> 05:02.671
E-mail, and carrier
pigeons on the hour.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.813
Honey, I thought we were
going to leave work behind

05:05.839 --> 05:06.909
for seven
fun-filled days.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.540
Silly, it's
not all work.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.906
I've signed up for
every spa treatment

05:10.944 --> 05:12.754
culminating in
the Salem Retreat,

05:12.780 --> 05:14.820
where you're pressed
between layers of hot rocks

05:14.848 --> 05:17.048
and ripe cranberries.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.454
Sounds bewitching.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.416
But aren't we all
going to be busy

05:20.454 --> 05:21.564
with our children?

05:21.589 --> 05:23.559
Deed, that's
what the Kidsatorium is for.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.431
Each morning
we drop off the pups

05:25.459 --> 05:28.129
and head for
the All-Day Breakfast Buffet.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.831
I hear they make a mean
egg yolk omelet...

05:30.864 --> 05:32.004
Ooh!

05:32.032 --> 05:35.102
...dipped with five kinds
of sausage.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.974
Whoa!

05:39.940 --> 05:40.970
We signed up
the kids

05:41.008 --> 05:43.378
for "Pirate Play
and Pillage" class.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.981
It teaches tolerance
for the peg-legged.

05:45.012 --> 05:48.552
Well, I'm going to use
the whole seven kid-free days

05:48.582 --> 05:49.982
to reshape my physique.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.717
Could happen.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.922
The Earth was created in six.

05:58.058 --> 05:58.928
Everyone all set?

05:58.959 --> 06:01.399
I think we all should thank my husband Stu

06:01.429 --> 06:04.099
for arranging this
wonderful getaway.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.131
No. You can thank me

06:05.165 --> 06:06.795
by having the time
of your lives.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.004
* Holiday

06:08.035 --> 06:09.565
Welcome!

06:09.603 --> 06:12.143
Bienvenue! Willkommen!

06:12.172 --> 06:13.042
Welcome aboard

06:13.073 --> 06:16.483
the world renowned
Dr. Lipschitz's Cruise!

06:16.510 --> 06:18.980
* Celebrate

06:19.012 --> 06:22.482
* Holiday...
- Stu must have taken Spike

06:22.516 --> 06:23.916
for one last
potty run.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.721
I-I'm sure he'll
be right back.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.324
He better.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.164
He's got all
our tickets.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.759
That sure is a nice cambera,
Susie.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.833
Thanks, Tommy.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.701
My mommy got it for me

06:34.728 --> 06:36.798
so she can see everything
she's missing.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.470
How come
she and your daddy can't come

06:39.500 --> 06:40.330
on the cruise with us?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.497
Well, my mommy's getting
a special award

06:42.536 --> 06:44.766
'cause she 'scovered
a new disease,

06:44.805 --> 06:46.165
and my daddy's cutting
the ribbon

06:46.206 --> 06:47.806
at the Dummi Bear Theme Park
opening.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.841
But I wanted to come
with you guys.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.607
And we're

06:50.644 --> 06:54.924
so glad you did,
Susie Carmichael.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.048
Hold the spotlight
on Lounge Singer Cynthia.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.960
* Dresses and shoes
are the only things *

07:02.990 --> 07:07.190
* That I'll share...

07:07.227 --> 07:08.157
That's my rules.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.595
Oh! I wonder
if it's too late

07:10.631 --> 07:11.671
to call my mommy.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.936
Hey, The ship's sailing
without us!

07:17.971 --> 07:18.611
Wait!

07:20.207 --> 07:22.037
Isn't that our ship?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.217
Whoa!

07:31.885 --> 07:33.745
Ahoy, mates!

07:33.787 --> 07:35.217
Captain Stu

07:35.255 --> 07:37.555
at your service!

07:37.591 --> 07:38.691
Climb aboard
for seven

07:38.726 --> 07:41.956
fun-filled days
on the S.S. Nancy.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.055
No fancy packaged tour.

07:44.097 --> 07:44.967
Just the thrill

07:44.998 --> 07:47.668
of the open sea,
the smell of the salt air,

07:47.701 --> 07:50.001
and the joy
of close friends

07:50.037 --> 07:51.237
and family.

07:51.271 --> 07:54.711
Drew, hold the shoes.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.720
I'm Queen of the World!

08:19.199 --> 08:22.669
Oh, isn't this a great vacation,
guys?

08:22.703 --> 08:23.673
As long as

08:23.704 --> 08:26.114
the "Queen" doesn't sing...

08:26.139 --> 08:27.039
I'm happy.

08:27.074 --> 08:30.644
And the bestest part is,
we're all togethers.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.246
Ah! This is
just like my bathie.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.624
Only there's no
rubber ducky, and...

08:40.654 --> 08:41.894
I'm not nakie.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.462
There's a ducky.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.956
Well, okay.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.334
Time to get nakie.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.761
Oh.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.327
Nakie!

09:01.975 --> 09:02.805
I can't believe

09:02.843 --> 09:05.353
you did this without
consulting us, Stu.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.648
Look at poor Kira.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.920
This was supposed
to be our honeymoon.

09:10.951 --> 09:11.891
Sorry, Chas.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.989
And here I was hoping
you'd be my first mate.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.192
Me? Really?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.694
Snap out of it, Gilligan.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.526
At the next port,

09:19.559 --> 09:20.959
we're getting off
this rinky-dink tub,

09:20.994 --> 09:24.204
and getting
on the Lipschitz Cruise.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.644
Don't you see?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.670
On a cruise right now,
we wouldn't be together.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.705
We'd be split up
between the pools, the spas,

09:34.742 --> 09:35.982
and the mile-long buffets.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.084
We're missing
Canadian Bacon Tuesday!

09:39.112 --> 09:41.622
Oh, can't this bait
trap go any faster?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.993
Hello? Hello?

09:46.019 --> 09:50.359
Welcome passengers
to what I like to call

09:50.390 --> 09:51.890
"The Voyage of Your Lifetime!"

09:51.925 --> 09:53.325
Everybody, I'm getting a signal.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.700
It's from the Lipschitz Cruise.

09:54.728 --> 09:55.958
Oh, quick, let
me talk to them.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.896
Mom, are you there?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.671
We're having a little trouble
with the wild child.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.801
Sounds like
a disgruntled passenger.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.966
Oh! Hello, Lipschitz.
Charlotte Pickles here.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.835
Could you send a rescue boat
right away?

10:06.874 --> 10:10.844
We're the squalid little boat
in the middle of the ocean.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.978
My muscles are atrophying
as we speak.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.323
Well, we paid
for spa treatments,

10:15.348 --> 10:16.078
and I'm not missing one!

10:16.116 --> 10:16.976
Hey, we're getting a signal
here.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.087
Oh, Dr. Lipschitz,
can you help us?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.918
My wife really needs
to see the ship's doctor.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.994
Huh? Hang on a sec, Mom.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.432
I'm picking up some
lame-o soap opera.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.858
What is it this time, Debbie?

10:27.895 --> 10:28.425
Okay.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.261
I made everyone dinner,

10:29.296 --> 10:32.296
so I shouldn't have
to clean up, too,

10:32.332 --> 10:35.072
Mom, all she did was hand us
a jar of peanut butter.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.912
Uh, can we talk about this
when your father and I get home?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.169
Yeah. Any E.T.A. on that?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.977
'Cause you've been gone
since, like, yesterday.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.410
We're still looking
for the leopard at...

10:45.445 --> 10:46.245
Oh, Nigel!

10:46.279 --> 10:47.749
Over there!
What's that?

10:47.781 --> 10:50.451
That's... I see spots!

10:50.483 --> 10:53.423
Watch out for that
limb, dearest.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.423
Here, neofelis nebulosa,

10:56.456 --> 10:57.986
come to Papa.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.125
Hello? I was talking here!

11:01.161 --> 11:02.031
Oh, I'm sorry, Debbie.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.772
Now you're on your own
for dinner tonight.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.768
You know, normal
families

11:06.800 --> 11:08.300
eat dinner together
once in a while.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.765
Marianne, perhaps
I can lure out the leopard

11:11.805 --> 11:14.775
by imitating its mating call.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.913
Okay, so we're not normal.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.748
But as a teen,
I reserve the right

11:22.783 --> 11:25.253
to alternately reject
and embrace my parental units.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.385
Consider us embraced.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.220
Now, keep an eye on Donnie.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.216
It's going to rain,

11:30.257 --> 11:31.787
and you know how he likes mud.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.897
She totally hung up on me.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.829
And I was having
a sensitive moment.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.195
Debbie, you are
so self-centered.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.403
I am not!

11:42.302 --> 11:46.012
Okay, what's the monkey saying
about me?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.910
Mmm.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.501
Oh, that's great.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.832
Oh, it's fine!

12:13.867 --> 12:14.967
Come on, pups,

12:15.002 --> 12:18.242
get underneath.
Come on.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.976
Come on, move it, move it,
move it! Down below!

12:34.154 --> 12:36.294
Oh!

12:44.564 --> 12:45.504
Captain Stu,

12:45.532 --> 12:46.902
I can't hold
the wheel.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.144
Will you stop calling
him captain?

12:49.169 --> 12:52.139
He has no idea
what he's doing!

12:52.172 --> 12:52.972
I do so!

12:53.006 --> 12:55.306
Does anybody know
where the brakes are

12:55.342 --> 12:56.242
on this thing?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.446
Jonathan, why aren't you
answering the phone?

12:58.478 --> 13:01.408
I need you to divert
a tropical storm.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.016
It's a 40-foot wall
of water.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.556
We're going to need
a bigger boat.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.161
Everyone get below!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.340
Phone overboard!

13:29.376 --> 13:29.976
Phone overboard!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.110
Charlotte, forget the phone!

13:32.145 --> 13:34.275
Jonathan!

14:08.581 --> 14:11.451
Well, this is how we came in...

14:11.484 --> 14:12.424
No!

14:16.689 --> 14:18.459
Oh, babies!

14:18.491 --> 14:19.561
Oh, Kimi.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.632
Chuckie, hold on to me.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.430
Why didn't
anybody stop me?

14:23.463 --> 14:26.273
Out of my way!

14:29.436 --> 14:31.296
Where you going?

14:31.338 --> 14:32.068
No, Charlotte!

14:32.105 --> 14:36.135
Charlotte, don't.
I-It's a rental.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.024
Come on!

14:47.054 --> 14:50.024
Right behind you,
boys!

14:52.559 --> 14:56.499
If you like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.499
If you need help, hang up...

15:03.536 --> 15:06.636
You're safe!

15:06.673 --> 15:08.243
I got it!

15:08.275 --> 15:10.435
Dil's binky!

15:10.477 --> 15:13.177
Oh, Betty,
thank you.

15:15.315 --> 15:19.015
I thought this might
come in handy, too.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.464
Abandon ship!

15:32.499 --> 15:36.569
I can't help feeling
partially responsible.

15:47.747 --> 15:53.317
* There's got to be
a morning after *

15:53.353 --> 15:58.493
* If we can hold on
through the night... *

15:58.525 --> 15:59.455
I know we can.

15:59.492 --> 16:05.202
* We have a chance
to find the sunshine... *

16:05.232 --> 16:10.742
* Let's keep on looking
for the light *

16:12.505 --> 16:14.335
Spike!

16:14.374 --> 16:15.044
Here, boy!

16:15.075 --> 16:16.075
Spike!

16:16.109 --> 16:18.049
Come over
here, Spike.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.550
Cynthia

16:21.581 --> 16:23.351
overboard!

16:23.383 --> 16:26.153
Cynthia! No!

16:28.421 --> 16:30.361
No, no, no, no.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.060
No, no, no, no.
There, there, Princess.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.493
We've all lost
something today.

16:34.527 --> 16:38.767
Why, I lost my cell phone
with 100 free minutes,

16:38.798 --> 16:41.098
and Daddy lost
his favorite sun visor,

16:41.134 --> 16:45.274
and Uncle Stu lost
all our respect.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.398
Cynthia!

17:24.844 --> 17:26.854
You guys, wake up!

17:26.878 --> 17:31.179
We're at the
bacation place.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.790
Ah, that was
a good nappie.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.622
It was just
like when Mommy

17:37.657 --> 17:40.487
used to rock us
to beddie-bye.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.727
Well, I likes a bed

17:41.761 --> 17:44.601
that doesn't move.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.141
Land ho!

17:50.170 --> 17:50.940
Land ho!

17:50.970 --> 17:55.380
I'll never set foot
on water again!

17:57.477 --> 17:58.247
Where are we?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.208
Oh, isn't it obvious?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.176
The palm trees,
the white sand,

18:01.214 --> 18:02.014
the crystal blue water...

18:02.048 --> 18:05.118
Why, we've landed
on an island resort.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.152
Place looks
pretty deserted.

18:07.187 --> 18:07.787
Oh, Betty.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.320
The best ones
always are.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.786
Just look for a cabana boy
carrying towels.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.855
I could use a double espresso,
chop-chop.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.634
Chop-chop...
Don't worry,

18:17.664 --> 18:18.674
I've got a map.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.728
We'll figure this out.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.197
We left here. We capsized here.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.636
I know exactly where we are.

18:24.671 --> 18:29.481
See? We're on this
tiny little island called...

18:29.509 --> 18:31.279
"Uninhabited."

18:31.311 --> 18:34.181
You mean we're
the only people here?

18:34.214 --> 18:38.224
Well, we'll just have to get back in
the boat and row to another island.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.221
One with coffee.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.422
Drew, the lifeboat's gone!

18:41.454 --> 18:42.764
Gone?!
- Where'd it go?

18:42.789 --> 18:43.719
Look, it's way out there.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.726
Wait, ho, ho, oh, great.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.889
We're marooned?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.297
With no food?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.729
How soon before we all
turn cannibal?

18:51.764 --> 18:52.934
I have to get
out of here!

18:54.934 --> 18:59.444
So, "Swiss Family DeVille"
he's not.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.505
Good morning, poodles!

19:07.547 --> 19:10.777
We were up all night

19:10.817 --> 19:12.217
looking for
that leopard.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.792
Debbie,
they're here!

19:13.820 --> 19:14.750
Ta da!

19:14.787 --> 19:18.827
Homemade coconut muffins
and fresh herbal tea.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.358
Debbie, this
is so sweet.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.933
Oh, and these
look heavenly.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.973
Afraid we must
eat and run.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.669
Mmm.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.900
Ooh, really
delicious, honey.

19:29.936 --> 19:30.936
But you guys
just got here!

19:30.970 --> 19:33.270
I know, but
the Foundation

19:33.306 --> 19:35.206
is expecting that
footage today,

19:35.242 --> 19:36.382
and we still
haven't got it.

19:36.409 --> 19:40.749
Nigel, I think
we should split up.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.750
Dearest!

19:41.781 --> 19:44.681
I thought we
were so happy.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.545
Oh...

19:47.587 --> 19:48.917
You mean to look

19:48.955 --> 19:51.385
for the leopard,
don't you?

19:51.424 --> 19:53.394
I can't believe this!

19:53.426 --> 19:55.256
You're always working.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.695
When's the last time
we took a vacation?

19:56.729 --> 20:00.229
But, Debbie, we travel
all over the world.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.267
I want a family vacation.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.672
You know, where we fight over
the bar of hotel soap.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.835
And Debbie hogs
all the good towels?

20:07.874 --> 20:09.344
And we order
room service.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.906
And we do dorky family
activities?

20:10.943 --> 20:15.253
Yes! Dorky sounds
really good right now.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.722
Well, girls,
I'm sorry.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.949
I didn't realize
you felt this strongly.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.985
I promise, as soon
as we find the leopard,

20:22.021 --> 20:24.891
we'll do dorky
family activities.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.634
It's settled then.

20:30.397 --> 20:33.597
You're leaving, too?
Mm-hmm.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.543
I was just going to hang out
on the beach today anyway.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.468
Debbie, are you forgetting that I talk to animals?

20:38.505 --> 20:39.705
Sadly, no. Your point?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.309
I'm going to find out where
that leopard is so we can leave,

20:42.342 --> 20:45.712
and maybe we'll
really take a vacation.

20:46.913 --> 20:47.953
Come on, Darwin.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.724
Darwin's staying here.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.423
See ya.

20:56.889 --> 20:57.889
Donnie!

20:57.924 --> 21:00.794
I did not slave
over a hot oven

21:00.827 --> 21:03.027
to feed the birds!

21:06.065 --> 21:08.795
When I write about my life--

21:08.835 --> 21:09.765
and I will--

21:09.802 --> 21:14.542
I will not be kind.

21:19.078 --> 21:19.978
Okeydoke, kids.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.452
You play here,
while the mommies and daddies

21:23.483 --> 21:28.363
try to ward off
the specter of doom.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.162
Babies, listen up.

21:37.196 --> 21:40.096
We're stucked
on a topical island

21:40.132 --> 21:42.542
that don't gots
no people on it.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.799
But we're here,
Angelica.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.707
I mean people who matter.

21:46.739 --> 21:47.909
And we gots no food.

21:47.940 --> 21:48.810
And no cookies!

21:48.841 --> 21:50.941
You don't know what
you're talking about,

21:50.977 --> 21:52.077
Angelica.

21:52.111 --> 21:52.981
Oh, yeah?

21:53.012 --> 21:55.552
I saw a movie 'bout it once.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.422
These little kids
were all alone

21:57.450 --> 21:59.350
on an island til.
They growed up

21:59.386 --> 22:01.446
and turned wild.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.418
The boy grew a beard
down to his feet,

22:03.456 --> 22:06.726
and they had to wear rags
for clothes.

22:07.427 --> 22:11.057
That's not the worstest part.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.027
* This isn't like

22:12.064 --> 22:12.874
* Our park back home

22:12.899 --> 22:15.599
* With slides and pools
and swings *

22:15.635 --> 22:16.735
* It's a creepy little island

22:16.769 --> 22:18.769
* With great big scary things

22:18.805 --> 22:21.565
* Where mutant lobsters
crawl around *

22:21.608 --> 22:23.138
* Chomping on little kids

22:23.175 --> 22:25.405
* And water wings
can't save you *

22:25.445 --> 22:27.845
* From the slimy,
squishy squids *

22:27.880 --> 22:28.750
* That's why you need

22:28.781 --> 22:31.151
* A princess--
someone beautiful, hmm? *

22:31.183 --> 22:34.593
* Like me-- to save you
from the scary claws *

22:34.621 --> 22:36.521
* That grab you from the tree

22:36.556 --> 22:38.456
* So if you don't wanna
end up *

22:38.491 --> 22:40.161
* Being mutant lobster food

22:40.192 --> 22:42.862
* Then keep
your Island Princess *

22:42.895 --> 22:44.755
* In a really happy mood

22:44.797 --> 22:47.727
* That means
no blowing bubbles *

22:47.767 --> 22:50.137
* That means no making smells

22:50.169 --> 22:51.739
* That means no bugging me

22:51.771 --> 22:54.111
* To wear my royal shells, ha!

22:54.140 --> 22:56.510
* Just do the things
I tell you *

22:56.543 --> 22:58.753
* Like bow when I walk by

22:58.778 --> 23:00.648
* Listen when I speak to you

23:00.680 --> 23:02.580
* But don't look me in the eye

23:02.615 --> 23:05.075
* You're not
some Island Princess *

23:05.117 --> 23:07.447
* There's not a squishy squid

23:07.487 --> 23:09.417
* There are no mutant lobsters

23:09.456 --> 23:11.156
* That would ever eat a kid

23:11.190 --> 23:13.460
* Don't listen to her stories

23:13.493 --> 23:15.093
* She always misbehaves

23:15.127 --> 23:17.497
* She's trying to scare
you babies *

23:17.530 --> 23:18.970
* Into being Island Slaves

23:18.998 --> 23:24.168
* Why do you always have to be
so good and nice and cheeky? *

23:24.203 --> 23:25.143
* Just face the facts

23:25.171 --> 23:27.941
* That I'm this
Island Princess Angeli-tiki *

23:27.974 --> 23:32.584
* So if you don't wanna end up
being mutant lobster food *

23:32.612 --> 23:34.912
* Then keep
your Island Princess *

23:34.947 --> 23:36.677
* In a really happy mood

23:36.716 --> 23:39.086
* Keep your Island Princess

23:39.118 --> 23:44.658
* In a really happy mood.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.831
Yeah!

23:47.794 --> 23:48.604
It's obvious.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.058
The first thing to do

23:50.096 --> 23:51.526
is make a signal fire.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.804
You know what else
is obvious?

23:53.833 --> 23:54.573
You're an idiot.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.541
We have to find
something to eat.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.869
All I saved was a couple jars

23:58.905 --> 23:59.705
of baby food.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.539
I never knew
strained peas and apricots

24:02.575 --> 24:03.575
went so well together.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.480
Oh, you ate
the baby food?!

24:05.512 --> 24:06.582
Babies don't need food.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.583
I have to keep my strength up

24:07.614 --> 24:11.084
for when you try to throw
me into the soup pot!

24:11.117 --> 24:11.777
He's delusional.

24:11.818 --> 24:14.148
This is all your fault!

24:14.186 --> 24:16.916
Whose idea was the
Stu Cruise to Doom?

24:16.956 --> 24:17.686
Oh, I would expect that

24:17.724 --> 24:20.264
from the Finsters
or the DeVilles,

24:20.292 --> 24:20.892
but Charlotte!

24:20.927 --> 24:22.187
I knew
this day was coming

24:22.228 --> 24:22.898
since you were in diapers!

24:22.929 --> 24:24.659
I should have never left Paris!

24:38.845 --> 24:41.905
This is the
Circle of Chaos.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.718
If we're going to survive
on this island,

24:44.751 --> 24:49.691
we can't ever step foot
in the Circle of Chaos.

24:49.722 --> 24:54.492
Wow. I feel
calmer already.

24:55.595 --> 24:58.125
We don't know when
we'll get off this island.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.674
Until we do,
we're gonna need order.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.870
First thing we need is a leader.

25:02.902 --> 25:05.302
Any volunteers?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.107
Stu, put down your hand.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.081
I nominate Betty.

25:11.110 --> 25:11.880
I accept.

25:11.911 --> 25:16.781
All in favor of me,
raise your hand.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.276
You're all going
to blindly follow Betty

25:18.317 --> 25:20.917
just because
she drew a circle in the sand?

25:20.953 --> 25:22.093
Yes!

25:22.121 --> 25:23.191
Thank you.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.292
As my first duty

25:24.323 --> 25:25.293
as your rightfully

25:25.324 --> 25:28.604
elected leader,
I'm assigning Stu to baby watch.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.658
The rest of
yez, follow me.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.928
Geez, all I wanted to do
was have a little adventure.

25:34.967 --> 25:39.637
Now everyone and their brother
is blaming me for this mess.

25:41.073 --> 25:45.753
Angelica, are the growed-
ups mad at my daddy?

25:45.778 --> 25:47.948
That's a blunderstatement.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.150
He's in big trouble.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.921
It's 'cause of him we're going
to have to live here forever.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.152
Maybe we can help.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.694
You babies are
gonna help?

25:57.724 --> 26:00.334
You can't keep
your fingers

26:00.359 --> 26:03.229
out of your nose.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.632
We gots to try, Angelica.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.596
Guys, up that hill.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.896
I think it's the drainforest,

26:10.937 --> 26:14.807
just like we sawed
on Nigel Strawberry's TV show!

26:14.841 --> 26:17.611
Does that mean
Nigel Strawberry's here?

26:17.644 --> 26:21.084
What makes you think
that big-nosed nature guy's

26:21.113 --> 26:22.013
on thi dinky island?

26:22.048 --> 26:24.848
Because that's the lastest place
we saw him.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.624
He was getting eated
by a crockagator.

26:27.654 --> 26:28.354
'Member?

26:28.387 --> 26:30.717
Nice knowing you, Chuckie.

26:30.757 --> 26:35.327
I bet if we go in there,
we'll find Nigel Strawberry.

26:35.361 --> 26:36.931
He can help us get home!

26:36.963 --> 26:40.833
And no one would be mad
at your daddy no more!

26:40.867 --> 26:44.967
And I wouldn't have to share
the waffle I gots in my diapie.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.074
Philip.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.705
Uh, if I had a waffle
in my diapie.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.252
See you, Angelica.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.224
Hey, get back here.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.262
You babies better
listen to me,

27:03.289 --> 27:04.019
or else!

27:04.056 --> 27:06.426
Or else...

27:06.458 --> 27:07.388
I'm going to build a signal fire

27:07.426 --> 27:10.956
that will have us
off this island in no time.

27:10.997 --> 27:11.827
Uh, let's see.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.204
Gum, my special
"writes-upside-down" pen

27:14.233 --> 27:15.173
and disposable razor.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.971
Great. I can chew, shave,
and write about it.

27:19.005 --> 27:19.605
On my head.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.808
I can't believe it, Cynthia.

27:21.841 --> 27:25.341
Those babies always
do whatever I say!

27:25.377 --> 27:27.747
What's all this junk?

27:27.780 --> 27:28.850
It's not junk, Angelica.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.921
These everyday items can be used

27:30.950 --> 27:33.220
to make a lot of things.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.822
That's it!

27:34.854 --> 27:36.894
I'll build a radio
and send a distress signal!

27:36.923 --> 27:39.163
Angelica, keep an eye on
the babies for me, okay?

27:39.191 --> 27:43.401
I'm supposed to baby-sit
those half-pipes?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.429
That's dog's work!

27:46.833 --> 27:48.133
Spike! Wake up!

27:48.167 --> 27:48.837
Watch the babies.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.468
I got
important things to do,

27:50.502 --> 27:54.112
like find someone
to be my royal subjects.

27:54.140 --> 27:54.970
Now, go!

27:55.007 --> 27:57.037
* Bow-wow-wow,
yippee-yo-yippee-yay *

27:57.076 --> 27:59.846
* Bow-wow,
yippee-yo, yippee-yay *

27:59.879 --> 28:01.809
* I'm that dog...

28:02.749 --> 28:08.719
* Ain't your average
Huckleberry Hound *

28:08.755 --> 28:12.785
* Why must I feel like that?

28:12.825 --> 28:17.855
* I have my pride,
chase the cat... *

28:17.897 --> 28:21.797
Cynthia, this vacation stinks!

28:21.834 --> 28:22.674
I've been walking forever,

28:22.701 --> 28:26.011
and no one's come along
to carry me yet!

28:26.038 --> 28:29.138
Hey, that bird's got a cupcake!

28:29.175 --> 28:31.835
Drop it, beak-head!

28:43.555 --> 28:46.955
There's got to be someone
around here I can boss.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.399
Ew! Ah...!

28:54.433 --> 28:55.173
Listen up, monkey.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.801
All that chimp chatter
really bugs.

28:57.837 --> 29:01.967
Just hand over those munchies
and keep painting.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.509
Wow! She's got that monkey

29:05.544 --> 29:07.984
waiting on her hoof and mouth.

29:08.014 --> 29:11.854
Cynthia, I could learn
a lot from that girl.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.894
Excuse me, Miss Bossy Lady?

29:16.255 --> 29:18.055
Pipe down, monkey.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.260
Hey, lady!

29:19.291 --> 29:21.191
Who's calling me a lady?

29:21.227 --> 29:22.057
I'm a teen!

29:22.094 --> 29:22.934
Where did you
come from?

29:22.962 --> 29:25.462
This is supposed to be
a deserted island.

29:25.497 --> 29:28.797
I'm Angeli-tiki,
the island princess.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.965
And I'm thirsty.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.938
And I lost my touch
for being bossy,

29:34.974 --> 29:36.514
so you got to teach me.

29:36.542 --> 29:39.152
No ice cubes
next time.

29:49.055 --> 29:51.255
There's the drainforest, guys!

29:51.290 --> 29:53.960
Bet we'll find Nigel Strawberry
down there.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.403
Now you're
talking, Tommy!

29:56.428 --> 29:59.228
Wait up! Wait for me!

30:03.469 --> 30:08.439
* This place is different
than our own backyard *

30:08.474 --> 30:11.914
* I hope
we haven't gone too far *

30:11.944 --> 30:16.284
* We're somewheres new
and we haven't a clue *

30:16.315 --> 30:20.915
* I just saw that butterfly
turn blue *

30:20.953 --> 30:24.263
* This is a strange
and mysterious place *

30:24.290 --> 30:28.900
* With lots of yummy buggies
for us to chase *

30:28.928 --> 30:33.598
* We're walking
and we don't know where *

30:33.632 --> 30:38.002
* Ooh-wee,
it's a jungle out here *

30:38.037 --> 30:41.037
* This place is really neat

30:41.073 --> 30:45.343
* Lots of wormies
for us to eat *

30:45.377 --> 30:49.877
* Lots of furry things
everywhere you stare *

30:49.916 --> 30:53.546
* Feels like I got some
in my underwear *

30:53.585 --> 30:58.215
* Monkeys swinging all around

30:58.257 --> 31:01.527
* I wonder if we're ever going
to get found *

31:01.560 --> 31:06.470
* We're having lots of fun,
hey, look over there... *

31:06.498 --> 31:10.568
Whoopie! Oh, boy! Yay!

31:10.602 --> 31:15.112
* Great big snake
hanging from a tree *

31:15.141 --> 31:18.441
* I hopes that it
don't eat up me *

31:18.477 --> 31:22.407
* Fat green lizard
looking me in the eye *

31:22.448 --> 31:27.088
* I sure am glad
that I'm not that fly *

31:27.119 --> 31:31.259
* Prettiful birdies
singing a song, tweet tweet *

31:31.290 --> 31:35.160
* I hope we don't stay here
for long *

31:35.194 --> 31:39.234
* We gots a job to do,
and we're headed up there *

31:39.265 --> 31:43.165
* Look sharp,
it's a jungle out here *

31:43.202 --> 31:48.012
* We gots a job to do,
and we're headed up there *

31:48.040 --> 31:52.680
* Ooh-wee,
it's a jungle out here. *

31:56.048 --> 31:58.448
Wow! It's got

31:58.484 --> 31:59.554
a gazillion feets.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.585
Well, down the hatch.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.190
Philip, no!

32:04.223 --> 32:05.223
Oh, sorry.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.027
Want a bite?

32:06.058 --> 32:09.498
No! I don't think
we should eat bugs

32:09.528 --> 32:10.558
no more.

32:10.596 --> 32:11.696
That's crazy talk, Lil.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.570
We've been raised on bugs.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.399
I know it, Philip,

32:14.433 --> 32:17.273
but that's afore I sawed
that poor fly

32:17.303 --> 32:21.013
get eated
by that big mean ol' flower.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.440
Now, you let him go!

32:29.348 --> 32:34.218
If I knowed the last bug I eated
would be the last bug I eated,

32:34.253 --> 32:39.063
I would've
eated it slower.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.331
Look! Growed-up feetprints!

32:40.359 --> 32:43.229
I bet
they're Nigel Strawberry's!

32:43.262 --> 32:45.662
Let's go!

32:45.697 --> 32:50.297
You know, it's lots easier going
potty in the drainforest

32:50.336 --> 32:51.166
than at home.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.303
And you don't have to worry

32:52.338 --> 32:56.778
'bout getting any on the floor
or the walls or anything.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.548
Guys? Uh...

32:59.578 --> 33:01.608
Wait up!

33:01.647 --> 33:03.277
Uh, uh, guys?

33:03.315 --> 33:07.145
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a clouded leopard.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.286
Have you seen any around?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.790
Sure. There's
one at the...

33:10.822 --> 33:14.232
Eliza!

33:17.129 --> 33:18.659
You'll never believe
what I just saw!

33:18.697 --> 33:23.537
There's a little girl at camp,
and she's a miniature Debbie!

33:23.569 --> 33:24.599
In every way.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.366
She's bossy, she's loud...

33:27.406 --> 33:29.676
she's hideous!

33:29.708 --> 33:31.408
Darwin, look!

33:31.443 --> 33:33.253
A dog?

33:33.279 --> 33:34.279
What's he doing here?

33:34.313 --> 33:37.253
Oh, spreading his fleas
on an unsuspecting world.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.487
Come on.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.163
Hey, hey, hey.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.762
Could you give a dog
a little warning?

33:48.794 --> 33:52.134
I'm trying
to do my business here.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.804
You know, it's funny.

33:54.833 --> 33:55.733
For a minute there

33:55.767 --> 33:58.467
I thought I actually heard you
talking to me.

33:58.504 --> 33:59.774
You talking to me?

33:59.805 --> 34:01.365
Are you talking to me?

34:01.407 --> 34:03.077
Yeah, I can talk
to animals.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.109
It's a long story.

34:04.143 --> 34:04.813
Should we come back?

34:04.843 --> 34:07.583
Ah, no problem; I'm done.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.453
I was just marking.

34:09.481 --> 34:10.821
Spike was here!

34:10.849 --> 34:16.259
Uh, sorry. I know...
Where are my manners?

34:16.288 --> 34:21.358
Down Spike! Down!
Get Off That Couch!

34:21.393 --> 34:22.463
I'm Eliza,

34:22.494 --> 34:23.364
and this is Darwin.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.838
Spike was here, too.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.210
Wow! I've been sneezing all day.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.810
My sniffer's on the blink.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.610
I can't even smell my own butt.

34:37.643 --> 34:38.743
And let me tell you,

34:38.777 --> 34:40.306
I've tried.

34:40.346 --> 34:41.005
Charmed.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.446
Spike,
what are you doing here?

34:43.482 --> 34:46.192
Well... I'm...

34:46.217 --> 34:49.217
To be honest with you,
I'm looking for my babies.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.155
You lost your babies?

34:50.188 --> 34:52.659
Probably too busy
drinking from the toilet.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.431
I was not! I
was sleeping.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.199
That was my
second guess.

34:56.228 --> 34:59.198
Hey, hey, smart boy,
you don't get it, okay?

34:59.231 --> 35:00.201
This is how it works.

35:00.232 --> 35:03.572
Usually they wander off,
I find them, no problem.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.502
But I can't smell.

35:04.536 --> 35:08.736
I might as well
not even call myself a dog.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.414
Don't worry,

35:10.442 --> 35:11.012
Spike.

35:11.042 --> 35:11.842
We'll help you find them.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.907
And I won't tell anyone
you lost them.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.845
Really? You really
will help me find them?

35:16.882 --> 35:20.492
Thank you!
That is so nice.

35:22.388 --> 35:25.888
Wow, you taste
pretty good.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.534
Animals.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.430
Tommy? Phil? Lil?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.774
Spike?

35:46.612 --> 35:47.652
Aw...

35:47.679 --> 35:53.949
I knew we shoulda stayed
at the beach.

35:53.985 --> 35:58.185
* This is the way
we wash our clothes *

35:58.224 --> 35:59.864
* Wash our clothes,
wash our clothes *

35:59.891 --> 36:02.791
* This is the way
we wash our clothes *

36:02.828 --> 36:04.558
* So early in the morning.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.935
Phil?

36:11.970 --> 36:12.940
Lillian!

36:12.971 --> 36:14.541
This is not funny!

36:37.028 --> 36:39.968
Oh, you're just my 'flection!

36:39.998 --> 36:41.698
How ya doin', Chuckie?

36:44.002 --> 36:46.002
Uh, my 'flection
never talked back!

36:46.037 --> 36:48.337
I been ascared
of lots of stuff 'afore,

36:48.374 --> 36:52.544
but I never been ascared
of me!

36:53.412 --> 36:54.852
Hey! Where'd it go?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.380
Um, Chuckie?

36:59.985 --> 37:02.345
That's not very nice.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.918
I'm not gonna make funny faces
with you no mores!

37:14.866 --> 37:16.936
Hey! Who's throwing stuff?

37:21.473 --> 37:24.543
My shorts feel kinda big...

37:24.576 --> 37:26.906
Aah! Who took my shoeses?

37:51.770 --> 37:56.580
My big-boy pants
aren't 'posed to do this!

37:58.544 --> 37:59.384
Oh!

37:59.411 --> 38:03.821
I don't even look
like Chuckie no mores.

38:27.138 --> 38:27.768
Phillip!

38:27.806 --> 38:29.936
No! We don't
do that no more!

38:29.975 --> 38:31.905
Aw, just one
little wormie, Lil!

38:31.943 --> 38:35.713
Don't you 'member
how good they used to taste?

38:35.747 --> 38:38.747
How they tickled
on the way down?

38:38.784 --> 38:39.554
No, I don't!

38:39.585 --> 38:42.945
I told you I'm
a vegebelatarian now.

38:43.922 --> 38:47.732
We don't eat bugs.
We pet 'em.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.959
I don't knows you
anymore, Lil.

38:50.996 --> 38:51.656
Do you...

38:51.697 --> 38:54.097
do you still like
to eat mud?

38:54.132 --> 38:55.902
Not if it has a face.

38:55.934 --> 38:56.774
But you're my twin!

38:56.802 --> 38:59.472
Who's gonna 'splain
Mommy's jokes to me

38:59.505 --> 39:02.105
or-or help me plant
my booger farm?

39:02.140 --> 39:06.610
And who's gonna tell me
when my feet smell?

39:13.452 --> 39:14.452
Okay, Dil.

39:14.486 --> 39:15.686
Do your stuff.

39:17.022 --> 39:20.732
Eeew! Tinky!

39:26.432 --> 39:29.902
Guys, I haven't seen Chuckie
for a long time.

39:29.935 --> 39:30.895
We better go back.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.166
You know how scared
Chuckie is of being losted.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.465
Chubby!

39:51.523 --> 39:53.593
Is everything okay, Chuckie?

39:57.663 --> 40:04.143
When did Chuckie
start talking backwards?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.173
Not a hair,

40:09.207 --> 40:11.137
not a paw print,

40:11.176 --> 40:12.836
not even a dropping!

40:12.878 --> 40:15.148
Must keep my chin up.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.080
I'll find that cat

40:16.114 --> 40:19.154
or my name's not
Nigel Archibald Thornberry.

40:19.184 --> 40:22.654
I'll find that big-nosed
nature guy,

40:22.688 --> 40:26.928
or my name's not Tommy
Awfully Bald Pickles!

40:29.961 --> 40:30.861
Donnie?

40:30.896 --> 40:32.896
Is that you?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.242
Look, it's Nigel Strawberry!

40:39.270 --> 40:41.070
We founded him!

40:41.106 --> 40:44.706
Great good all,
a gaggle of babies!

40:44.743 --> 40:46.043
Children!

40:46.077 --> 40:47.247
Stay right there!

40:47.278 --> 40:48.808
I'm coming down!

40:55.687 --> 40:59.487
Not the way I intended.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.234
Heavens, what a fall.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.236
I must get to those babies.

41:17.809 --> 41:21.179
Are you okay,
Mr. Strawberry?

41:21.212 --> 41:25.252
She called me "mister!"

41:25.283 --> 41:26.223
Silly Billy.

41:26.251 --> 41:29.561
I'm only this many years old!

41:29.588 --> 41:30.988
Do any of you remember

41:31.022 --> 41:32.992
where I left my tricycle?

41:35.193 --> 41:37.133
That's one old
three-year old.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.262
Uh, no, Mr. Strawberry.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.267
We're shipwrecked
on this island.

41:41.299 --> 41:44.699
We was hoping you could
help Tommy's daddy.

41:44.736 --> 41:49.036
Watch what I can do.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.114
Spinning?

41:51.142 --> 41:55.682
I think Nigel Strawberry's
acting kinda funny.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.154
Maybe he's
got diapie rash.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.253
Oh, yeah!

41:59.284 --> 42:01.724
Wee! Wee!

42:06.592 --> 42:08.032
Did you catch
a whiff of anything yet?

42:08.059 --> 42:11.659
It's, look, it-it-it,
it's kind of a damp smell

42:11.697 --> 42:15.567
that's a cross between
sour milk and poop.

42:15.601 --> 42:17.771
Well,
actually I kind of like it.

42:17.803 --> 42:21.313
But everything smells
pretty much the same to me.

42:21.339 --> 42:22.709
Ha! Humans.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.141
How do you live?

42:24.175 --> 42:28.075
And who put
the "poo" in pooch?

42:35.954 --> 42:38.764
Okay, there you go.
Look at yourself now.

42:38.790 --> 42:40.630
All right, you got
a little dog pee on you.

42:40.659 --> 42:41.889
Oh, my gosh! You're the..

42:41.927 --> 42:44.157
I am Siri,
the clouded leopard.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.595
I'm Spike,
the purebred mutt!

42:46.632 --> 42:48.032
See these claws?

42:48.066 --> 42:48.926
Sniff my butt!

42:48.967 --> 42:50.037
Spike,

42:50.068 --> 42:51.298
why'd you say that?

42:51.336 --> 42:52.196
I was being social.

42:52.237 --> 42:55.037
Of course,
a simple handshake wouldn't do.

42:55.073 --> 43:00.313
Hey, twitchy, I do not
shake with cats, okay?

43:00.345 --> 43:04.145
Now... a small
chimp for breakfast,

43:04.182 --> 43:05.182
a mutt for lunch,

43:05.216 --> 43:07.686
and a sensible girl
for dinner.

43:07.719 --> 43:10.389
Hey, chimpboy,
will you stop worrying?

43:10.421 --> 43:12.761
I know all about cats

43:12.791 --> 43:13.891
with a capital K.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.695
Sit on a windowsill,
hack up a fur ball.

43:16.728 --> 43:19.898
Ooh,
that's very ferocious.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.701
Spike, this isn't
your regular house cat.

43:22.734 --> 43:23.974
They all twitch
their whiskers

43:24.002 --> 43:27.942
one whisker at a time,
just like you and me.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.882
* Don't go and be fooled

43:35.914 --> 43:38.324
* By those fancy pants

43:38.349 --> 43:42.389
* It's just
her feline arrogance *

43:42.420 --> 43:46.990
* Flaunting their collars
with tinkly bells *

43:47.025 --> 43:51.295
* She thinks her litter box
don't smell *

43:51.329 --> 43:53.229
Whoa, hey,
who cut the cheese?

43:53.264 --> 43:54.034
Was that you, baby?

43:54.065 --> 43:55.265
You may want
to reexamine your diet.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.670
* Can the old
canine philosophies *

43:59.738 --> 44:04.208
* Why don't you just go
and tend to your fleas *

44:04.242 --> 44:05.242
* Don't push me, mutt

44:05.276 --> 44:08.206
* I'm just not in the mood

44:08.246 --> 44:12.016
* You're one swipe away
from becoming cat food *

44:12.050 --> 44:17.020
* Don't go and be fooled
by this crazy cat *

44:17.055 --> 44:21.055
* Don't go and listen
to his crazy facts *

44:21.092 --> 44:25.462
* Not gonna tell you twice,
you better watch your back *

44:25.496 --> 44:27.726
* Don't go and be fooled

44:27.766 --> 44:32.866
* The big bad cat's
a fur-ball-hacking *

44:32.904 --> 44:35.444
* Rodent-snacking act

44:35.473 --> 44:38.443
That's right, an act.

44:38.476 --> 44:40.146
You're just a pussycat.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.048
You think you're tough?

44:41.079 --> 44:44.019
* I dare you, Spike,
to call my bluff *

44:44.049 --> 44:44.979
You're a very scawy puddytat.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.986
* You're one swipe away
from becoming toast *

44:48.019 --> 44:51.759
Eliza, get my doggy bag.
I'm about to catch a snack.

44:51.790 --> 44:54.430
We can settle this right now,
right here--

44:54.459 --> 44:56.959
mano a mano, dogo a cato.

44:56.995 --> 44:58.925
Ow!
That has gotta hurt--

44:58.964 --> 45:00.104
falling off a cliff
into a sticker bush.

45:00.131 --> 45:04.341
* Not gonna tell you twice,
you better watch your back *

45:04.369 --> 45:06.069
Oh! Here I am. Come get me.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.942
You think I'm afraid
of your claws?

45:08.974 --> 45:10.184
Coochie-coochie-coo.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.778
Bombs away, ladies.

45:12.811 --> 45:14.381
Come on, me and you.
Come on, let's go right now.

45:14.412 --> 45:17.022
I'll rip
that fur coat off ya

45:17.048 --> 45:17.818
and wear it,

45:17.849 --> 45:18.819
and all my dog friends
will be going,

45:18.850 --> 45:22.220
"Spike, where did you get
that skanky cat coat?"

45:27.092 --> 45:29.132
You hear what
I'm saying, red?

45:30.395 --> 45:31.425
I thought cats

45:31.462 --> 45:32.902
didn't like water.

45:32.931 --> 45:33.771
But frankly, Eliza,

45:33.799 --> 45:36.199
she did need a bath...
Come on, come on.

45:36.234 --> 45:37.344
Oh! Whoa!

45:37.368 --> 45:39.468
Aw, what happened?

45:39.504 --> 45:41.374
I'm outta here,
I gotta go find my babies.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.836
Helpless offspring?

45:42.874 --> 45:43.844
Yeah! Yeah!
That's it. That's it.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.205
Have you seen 'em?
Little ones, walk on two feet?

45:46.244 --> 45:49.824
Last time I saw 'em,
they were on the beach.

45:50.415 --> 45:51.245
Walking...

45:51.282 --> 45:53.052
stumbling, actually.

45:53.084 --> 45:53.754
Two feet?

45:53.785 --> 45:56.855
Yeah, they're
my human babies.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.491
I thought we were
looking for puppies!

46:01.526 --> 46:04.196
No, no. My pups
are home with the wife.

46:04.229 --> 46:05.399
She can't travel.

46:05.430 --> 46:06.330
Delicate stomach.

46:06.364 --> 46:07.874
Me, I could eat anything--

46:07.899 --> 46:09.899
shoes, furniture, pencils

46:09.935 --> 46:10.735
with the little erasers.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.098
I ate one of Chuckie's
diapers one time

46:12.137 --> 46:13.437
Spike...
and let me tell you...

46:13.471 --> 46:15.071
Spike!
That is spicy.

46:15.106 --> 46:19.136
Spike! We have to find those
babies before Siri does!

46:19.177 --> 46:20.107
Come on!

46:21.146 --> 46:24.346
When will I think
before I bark?

46:27.418 --> 46:30.388
Spike, is that you?

46:30.421 --> 46:33.161
Tommy? Kimi?

46:33.491 --> 46:36.161
Anybody?!

46:37.896 --> 46:39.926
Oh, no, not monkeys!

46:44.269 --> 46:48.269
Hey, they're chasing
that little one!

46:48.306 --> 46:51.836
That's not very nice.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.956
Now, you big monkeys
go 'way.

47:04.990 --> 47:09.060
You was little monkeys
yourselfs once...

47:09.094 --> 47:15.434
So just go away and leave
this little monkey 'lone.

47:16.201 --> 47:18.901
Shoo! Shoo!

47:26.577 --> 47:29.347
Thanks.

47:29.380 --> 47:34.950
Wow! I saveded someone
'stead of someone saving me.

47:34.986 --> 47:39.986
I must be a wild boy now.

47:47.632 --> 47:51.202
Babies!

47:52.203 --> 47:53.503
Tommy!

47:53.538 --> 47:55.968
Susie!

47:56.007 --> 47:58.207
Oh, my dogness!

47:58.243 --> 48:01.553
What if I never feel
their sticky jammy fingers

48:01.579 --> 48:02.709
poking in my ears again?

48:02.747 --> 48:07.217
What if I never find a floating
diaper in my doggie bowl?

48:07.252 --> 48:07.752
What if...

48:07.785 --> 48:09.485
Spike! Snap out of it!

48:09.520 --> 48:11.490
Right, right, right, right.

48:11.522 --> 48:12.992
Not helping. Not helping.

48:13.024 --> 48:15.134
Focus, focus, Spike.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.930
What does "focus" mean?

48:16.962 --> 48:18.662
Right, right.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.426
But who's going
to sneak me donuts?

48:21.466 --> 48:23.526
Come on, we're almost there.

48:38.149 --> 48:39.379
These are much better

48:39.417 --> 48:42.017
than the cookies we gots
back at the grass hut,

48:42.053 --> 48:45.163
and I don't have to share
with no dumb babies.

48:45.190 --> 48:48.490
I mean, um,
dumb baby savages.

48:48.526 --> 48:50.356
Tell me about it.

48:50.395 --> 48:52.395
I have to share
with a pigtailed weirdo,

48:52.430 --> 48:57.070
a jungle freak,
and a monkey in a tank top.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.742
Uh, refill.

49:03.774 --> 49:06.114
Why do I have to get it?

49:06.144 --> 49:07.614
You said you
wanted to learn

49:07.645 --> 49:09.005
how to be
bossy, right?

49:09.047 --> 49:10.647
This is how
you learn.

49:10.681 --> 49:14.421
Extra ice, two straws.

49:16.187 --> 49:19.557
I would trade the monkey
for her any day.

49:19.590 --> 49:22.190
Debbie, come in. Over.

49:22.227 --> 49:23.627
Hey, Mom, how's it going?

49:23.661 --> 49:25.131
It's not going at all.

49:25.163 --> 49:26.633
Have you heard from your father?

49:26.664 --> 49:28.604
No, but get this, Mom.

49:28.633 --> 49:33.043
Tell me later, honey.
Be back soon.

49:33.071 --> 49:36.241
Angeli-tiki is nobody's lackey.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.251
Hey, lady!

49:43.281 --> 49:45.351
What's that
bubble thing?

49:45.383 --> 49:46.423
A bathysphere.

49:46.451 --> 49:47.091
It goes underwater.

49:47.118 --> 49:49.088
You know,
like a submarine.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.660
Getting thirsty here!

49:50.688 --> 49:54.058
That girl's
even bossier than me.

50:04.069 --> 50:04.869
Those dumb babies

50:04.902 --> 50:07.072
are practically
on top of a mountain,

50:07.105 --> 50:08.505
and I'm gonna be blamed!

50:08.539 --> 50:11.309
I gotta go home
and pretend I'm innocent.

50:11.342 --> 50:14.382
Um, Debbie?

50:14.412 --> 50:19.822
I was supposed to be home for,
uh, the Island Sacrifice.

50:19.850 --> 50:22.720
Okay, my mom will drive you
when she gets here.

50:22.753 --> 50:24.193
But I have to go now.

50:24.222 --> 50:25.162
I'm the princess.

50:25.190 --> 50:27.560
Who do you think's
going to throw in the goat?

50:27.592 --> 50:30.132
Oh, it's a native thing.

50:30.161 --> 50:31.231
Oh, Mom will understand.

50:31.262 --> 50:35.302
But I am not waiting around
to watch the goat bite it.

50:38.169 --> 50:39.569
Is that a CD player?

50:39.604 --> 50:41.144
Yeah, only the best.

50:41.172 --> 50:45.182
You know an awful lot
for an "island girl."

50:45.210 --> 50:49.150
Um, well, see, a TV
washed up on the beach once

50:49.180 --> 50:54.290
and the island king
made the whole tribe watch it.

50:57.122 --> 50:58.162
I love this song!

50:58.189 --> 50:58.819
Hey, me, too.

51:06.797 --> 51:09.497
Woo!

51:09.534 --> 51:15.214
* Darling you've got
to let me know *

51:15.240 --> 51:17.710
* Should I stay or should I go

51:19.210 --> 51:22.580
* If you say
that you are mine *

51:22.613 --> 51:26.553
* I'll be here
till the end of time *

51:27.885 --> 51:31.855
* So you've got to let me know

51:31.889 --> 51:35.189
* Should I stay
or should I go? *

51:35.226 --> 51:36.686
Yow!

51:36.727 --> 51:38.327
* It's always tease...

51:38.363 --> 51:39.033
Whoa!

51:42.933 --> 51:44.273
Whoa!

51:48.439 --> 51:50.739
Debbie, there's a bunch of
a babies lost around here,

51:50.775 --> 51:52.275
and the leopard's
after them!

51:52.310 --> 51:54.810
I didn't know there was
a leopard out there.

51:54.845 --> 51:55.775
I'm gonna be

51:55.813 --> 51:56.653
in big trouble.

51:56.681 --> 51:59.181
Get back here and
put your seat belt on.

52:01.319 --> 52:03.719
C'mon, Cynthia.
We're taking a ride!

52:05.223 --> 52:06.263
Angeli-tiki!

52:08.559 --> 52:10.499
Oh, man.

52:21.339 --> 52:22.769
* Twinkle, twinkle,

52:22.807 --> 52:26.207
* Little star... *

52:43.961 --> 52:45.661
Debbie,
what happened?

52:45.696 --> 52:50.566
I was taking care of this
island princess and...

52:50.601 --> 52:53.401
What's she doing
in the bathysphere?

52:53.438 --> 52:54.098
I didn't say

52:54.138 --> 52:56.638
I was taking care
of her well.

52:56.674 --> 53:00.584
Where are the lights
on this thing?

53:13.591 --> 53:15.331
I'm a kangaroo.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.530
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.

53:17.562 --> 53:18.762
I'm a froggie,

53:18.796 --> 53:20.666
and I'm frogging.

53:20.698 --> 53:24.698
All this hopping
is making my diapie creep.

53:24.735 --> 53:25.895
Ooh...

53:25.936 --> 53:28.866
Now I'm
a giant kitty cat,

53:28.906 --> 53:30.836
with lots

53:30.875 --> 53:33.335
of pointy toothies!

53:34.945 --> 53:38.515
Nigel Strawberry plays with
wild aminals all the time.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.249
He'll get us
out of this scrape.

53:41.286 --> 53:42.446
Does kitty want a mousie?

53:42.487 --> 53:46.357
Does kitty want to dress up
in dolly clothes and take a ride

53:46.391 --> 53:47.061
in Nanny's pram?

53:49.894 --> 53:52.334
Kitty gave me a boo-boo.

53:55.600 --> 53:58.370
Nice kitty.

54:03.974 --> 54:05.614
Chuckie, be careful!

54:05.643 --> 54:07.613
He's so brave.

54:07.645 --> 54:08.305
Or dumb.

54:27.398 --> 54:30.368
Hey, I been looking
all over for you.

54:30.401 --> 54:33.001
I don't like being half nakie.

54:33.037 --> 54:36.307
I want my clothses back.

54:37.975 --> 54:40.345
Hey, I got sticks in my hair!

54:40.378 --> 54:41.708
I gots no shoeses!

54:41.746 --> 54:44.616
Oh, ouch, my feet!

54:46.784 --> 54:47.754
That's better.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.985
Now I can see.

55:03.368 --> 55:07.908
* I'm rockin' a BMX bike

55:07.938 --> 55:10.538
* I'm rockin' a musclehead car

55:10.575 --> 55:14.005
* I freestyle where ever
I go, whoa *

55:14.044 --> 55:17.084
* I don't cry whenever I fall

55:20.851 --> 55:22.621
Whoa!

55:30.127 --> 55:35.397
* And I can run
as fast as anyone I know *

55:35.433 --> 55:37.473
* My heart is strong

55:37.502 --> 55:43.472
* I'll be the one
who takes control. *

55:57.888 --> 56:02.058
Look, Mumsy, I'm a whale.

56:02.092 --> 56:06.062
You sure he can
really help us, Tommy?

56:06.096 --> 56:07.126
Of course, Susie.

56:07.164 --> 56:09.504
He's Nigel Strawberry.

56:09.534 --> 56:14.574
He's, um, the bestest
nature 'splorerer ever.

56:14.605 --> 56:17.905
Or... I thought he was.

56:17.942 --> 56:21.082
Guess we're stucked here
till somebody finds us.

56:21.111 --> 56:23.151
Who's going to find us in here?

56:23.180 --> 56:25.050
I know what'll cheer

56:25.082 --> 56:26.952
everybody up.

56:26.984 --> 56:28.794
A nice waffle.

56:28.819 --> 56:30.819
It's kind of crusty.

56:30.855 --> 56:34.655
You sure you don't gots
any mable syrup in there?

56:34.692 --> 56:37.502
Nope.
But I got some ketchup.

56:37.528 --> 56:40.428
Watch this one.

56:41.198 --> 56:41.998
What 'dat?

56:42.032 --> 56:43.172
What 'dat?!

56:44.268 --> 56:48.168
Maybe TV people are only
good at doing stuffs on TV.

56:48.205 --> 56:52.535
Well, I guess we'll be living
on this island from now on.

56:52.577 --> 56:53.537
That means...

56:53.578 --> 56:58.518
I might not see my family
again for a long time.

57:00.651 --> 57:03.021
Uh, you gonna eat
that waffle?

57:03.053 --> 57:06.023
Shh, Phillip. Susie's sad.

57:06.056 --> 57:07.186
I'm sad, too.

57:07.224 --> 57:09.934
I want my mommy and daddy.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.500
Me, too.

57:13.831 --> 57:14.601
I'm sorry, guys.

57:14.632 --> 57:17.102
I never shoulda
broughted you here.

57:17.134 --> 57:18.244
Angelica was right.

57:18.268 --> 57:25.638
I am just a backyard baby
with a diapie full of dreams.

57:27.111 --> 57:28.251
No, you're not.

57:28.278 --> 57:33.578
Tommy, you took us through
the drainforest all by yourself!

57:33.618 --> 57:36.688
And led us up
the side of the mountain.

57:36.721 --> 57:39.491
And you founded
Nigel Strawberry.

57:39.524 --> 57:42.664
And you saved me from
the giant kitty cat.

57:42.693 --> 57:44.093
Oh, you got lots more

57:44.128 --> 57:47.798
than dreams
in your diapie, Tommy.

57:49.600 --> 57:50.500
Thanks, guys.

57:50.535 --> 57:53.835
That's the nicest stuff
anyone's ever said.

57:53.871 --> 57:56.611
So, hey, even though
we're stucked in a cave

57:56.641 --> 58:01.981
and there isn't any boat
and we can't swim,

58:02.012 --> 58:05.852
I still promise
to get you out of here!

58:06.917 --> 58:10.787
It's like my hero Nigel
Strawberry always says...

58:10.821 --> 58:13.191
The Martians
have landed!

58:13.223 --> 58:13.963
Um, no.

58:13.991 --> 58:15.831
I was thinking
'bout when he says,

58:15.860 --> 58:18.160
"Don't give up hope,

58:18.195 --> 58:19.155
fateful viewers!"

58:22.166 --> 58:24.126
Ahoy, babies!

58:24.168 --> 58:27.938
Now who's your princess?

58:27.972 --> 58:29.142
Yay! Let's go!

58:29.173 --> 58:32.883
We're saved!

58:32.910 --> 58:35.680
Drew, there's no longer
a ringing in my ears

58:35.713 --> 58:39.023
from constant
cell-phone usage.

58:39.049 --> 58:40.549
Oh, isn't this paradise?

58:40.585 --> 58:42.045
Sure is, honey!

58:42.086 --> 58:43.086
Whoa! Honey!

58:43.120 --> 58:45.620
Didi, you think
this is done?

58:45.656 --> 58:49.256
I've never cooked a fish
with its head still on.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.633
Well, let me see.

58:50.661 --> 58:51.961
Does it flake
when...

58:53.798 --> 58:55.828
My fish!

58:56.834 --> 58:58.744
Who's that
little cannibal boy?

58:58.769 --> 59:00.039
Those look an awful lot

59:00.070 --> 59:01.840
like Chuckie's
sneakers.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.582
You ate the fish and Chuckie!

59:04.609 --> 59:05.579
Come on, guys!

59:05.610 --> 59:06.940
After him!

59:11.048 --> 59:11.948
Whoa!

59:11.982 --> 59:12.922
Hey, whoa-oh...

59:12.950 --> 59:14.280
He's getting away!

59:22.660 --> 59:25.660
Well, it's not a
clouded leopard,

59:25.696 --> 59:27.666
but at least I'll have film
of something.

59:28.733 --> 59:30.073
Donnie!

59:33.838 --> 59:36.668
This is supposed to be
a deserted island.

59:36.707 --> 59:38.977
Oh, thank heavens!

59:39.009 --> 59:41.679
We're part of an elaborate
television stunt

59:41.712 --> 59:43.282
designed to humiliate us.

59:43.313 --> 59:44.823
Who are you?

59:47.417 --> 59:48.717
Hold it.

59:48.753 --> 59:52.063
My name is Marianne Thornberry.

59:52.089 --> 59:54.189
From the nature show?

59:54.224 --> 59:55.134
We're shipwrecked.

59:55.159 --> 59:55.829
Can you help us, Marianne?

59:55.860 --> 59:58.400
Of course. Our
camp is nearby.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.928
Oh, Mom. What's up?

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:02.665
I need you to
bring the Comvee

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.830
over to the east beach.

01:00:03.868 --> 01:00:05.798
Uh, that may be a problem.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.096
Don't worry about
cleaning up.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:10.267
Oh, thanks,
but that's not the problem.

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:11.377
Just get here. Now.

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:12.808
My daughter will bring
our trailer

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:15.183
and my husband
will be along soon and...

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:17.382
Behold fellow islanders!

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:21.954
I, Stu Pickles,
have built us a radio!

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:23.916
Stu, who's watching the kids?

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.364
Oh, Angelica said she'd take
care of them.

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:32.861
Chuckie!

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:34.397
Oh, this is very strange.

01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:36.971
I feel like this
has happened before.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:42.271
Look at them...

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:43.266
chasing their own tails.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:46.277
If only I could tell them
that it doesn't work.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.080
I know, I've done it.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:49.751
I've chased my tail
a million times.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.180
It does not work.

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:54.245
It's getting a signal!

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:55.824
I'm very impressed.

01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:57.253
Oh, Stu's an inventor.

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.457
Runs an ad in the shop-and-buy.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.430
Girls, have you seen
some children?

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.260
Just a bossy 3-year-old

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:06.164
who has delusions
of being a princess.

01:01:06.196 --> 01:01:08.366
Angelica!
- I'm the boss

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:09.268
of this bathie thing.
That's her!

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:12.269
We haven't moved a bit,
Angelica.

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:14.972
She must have turned on
the radio in the bathysphere.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.135
A 3-year-old's driving
the bathysphere?!

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:18.905
What the heck?

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:23.912
Hey, it's no problem.

01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:26.748
We can track them by
radar from the Comvee.

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.094
Uh... yeah. Except...

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:32.119
I sunk the Comvee.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.986
You what?!

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.834
I'm beginning to think you
tooked this scrubmarine

01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:40.904
without permission,
Angelica.

01:01:40.931 --> 01:01:45.271
Oh, you think you're such
a know-it-all, Carmichael.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:46.372
Now, here's the right button.

01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:50.782
You need this to drive.

01:01:50.808 --> 01:01:52.378
Now, here's
the other right button.

01:01:53.978 --> 01:01:56.478
* I'll send
an S.O.S. to the world *

01:01:56.513 --> 01:02:00.793
* I'll send an S.O.S.
to the world *

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.818
* I hope that someone
gets my *

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:06.464
* I hope
that someone gets my *

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.960
* I hope that someone
gets my *

01:02:08.993 --> 01:02:15.003
* Message in a bottle, yeah

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:18.236
* Message in a bottle...

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.038
Oh, I can't get a signal.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.110
We've got to try to reach them
on your coconut.

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:24.779
Uh-uh, Carmichael.

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:25.839
Hello. Calling Angelica.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:28.006
She really did give me
cream soda.

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:28.975
Angelica, Susie.
Can you hear me?

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:30.923
You didn't have permission,
Angelica!

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:31.978
Angelica!

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:34.946
Stop fighting this instant
and listen to your father!

01:02:34.985 --> 01:02:35.915
...accessory!

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:38.123
Sorry, Mommy.

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:39.985
Our mommies and daddies!

01:02:40.024 --> 01:02:41.534
Daddy, tell Susie
to stop bothering me

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:43.528
while I'm trying to drive
a scrubmarine!

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.430
Give me that, Angelica.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.910
Hiya!

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:02.575
What's this?

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.052
A new toy?

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:08.190
Kippers!

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:10.548
I'm the happiest lad
in all of England!

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:13.417
Listen, Angeli-tiki,

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.357
it's me, Debbie.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.231
Let me talk to my Dad.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.360
Stop eating those smelly
fish and talk to the teen.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:22.425
This little fishie
goes to market.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.096
This little fishie stays home.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.444
Great. Dad finally lost it.

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.540
Something's wrong with Nigel.

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.841
Girls, this is Mrs.Thornberry.

01:03:29.874 --> 01:03:31.914
Do you see a red handle?

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.512
I see it!

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:34.343
I need you to push that up.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.508
That will bring you
up to the surface.

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:39.216
Drooly,
don't touch that!

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:56.929
Oh, no,
Nigel Strawberry!

01:03:56.967 --> 01:04:00.937
This calls
for my 'mergency bottle.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.978
Hello there.

01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:16.248
Well, what have we here?

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:20.086
Who are all you positively
adorable children?

01:04:20.124 --> 01:04:21.234
Huh?

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:22.158
We're shipwrecked.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.932
We went all over the island
looking for you.

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.132
I saved them,
but then Carmichael

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:28.503
tried to drive this
tub-boat and now...

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:30.172
We just want to go home.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.240
Well, of course
you do, young lady.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.640
And so we shall.

01:04:35.672 --> 01:04:38.212
Hmm. Bit of a pickle.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:39.012
No fuel left.

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:40.983
The radar appears
to be knocked out,

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:42.211
which means I have
no idea where we are

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:46.276
and we're almost
out of oxygen.

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:46.916
I'm bored.

01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:49.151
Yes, and there's that, too.

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:50.516
Angeli-tiki, come in!

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.124
What's going on down there?!

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:52.916
Deborah?

01:04:52.957 --> 01:04:54.387
Is that you?

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:57.164
Dad! You're back to normal!

01:04:57.194 --> 01:04:58.064
Well, Dad-normal anyway.

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:00.525
Oh, Nigel,
thank goodness you're all right.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:01.434
Can you bring her
to the surface?

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:05.135
Impossible at the moment,
dearest.

01:05:05.169 --> 01:05:06.069
You'll have to engage

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.573
the automatic-retrieval system
in the Comvee.

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:10.665
And I don't want
to alarm anyone,

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:11.977
but we're a tad low
on oxygen down here.

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:15.209
Copy that.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.975
We'll get you as soon as we can.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:17.754
Over and out.

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:21.391
Okay, we have to raise
the Comvee.

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:40.565
No go.

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:41.414
The pump's destroyed

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:44.668
and there's a huge
rip in the pontoon.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.235
What, it's ripped?

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:47.977
Hang on.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:51.952
The professor's getting
an idea.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:06:03.131
How about a little song
to lift our spirits?

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:07.328
* Old MacDonald had a farm

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:09.104
* E-I-E-I-O

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:14.143
* And on his farm
he had a ring-tailed lemur *

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:16.341
* E-I-E-I-O

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:17.773
* With a guttural roar here

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.307
* And a throaty rumble
there... *

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:21.454
Okay, here's the plan.

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:25.248
We'll transfer force from
the bi-pedal energy generator.

01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:27.452
To the dual reduction chamber.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.094
The resulting compressed
atmospheric matrix

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.190
will transverse the tubular
transport mechanisms,

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:34.362
which you gentlemen will connect
to the deflated pontoon.

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:37.161
This will increase
the displacement coefficient

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:38.464
of the Comvee and it will rise

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:41.725
aided by a fulcrum driven
counter balance

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:44.025
weighted with coconuts.

01:06:44.068 --> 01:06:44.828
Let's do it!

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:51.637
How are we going to inflate
a pontoon with a hole in it?

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:52.775
Oh, no.

01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:54.379
What do we do now?

01:06:54.411 --> 01:06:55.011
What's going on?

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:56.275
We can't raise
the Comvee.

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:58.483
We need something
to patch it.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.215
Eliza!

01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:01.519
There's a rafty thingy
out there.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:02.621
Can we use that?

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:03.252
It's perfect!

01:07:03.287 --> 01:07:04.047
She found your boat, Spike.

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:06.788
They can use it to
patch the Comvee.

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:07.793
I'll get it!

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:08.664
Spike, no!

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:09.462
The waves are too big!

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:12.703
Hey, this is Spike
you're talking to.

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:18.099
I've paddled my way to more
tennis balls than I can count!

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.843
If I could count.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.542
But I'm afraid
you won't make it!

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:28.745
And if I don't,
well, no one's going to say

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:33.078
that ol' Down Spike
didn't try his best.

01:07:35.319 --> 01:07:39.459
You only go around once
in this crazy, mixed-up life.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:43.862
Well, not cats.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:44.833
They get nine lives

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:47.761
while dogs have to cram
seven years into one.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:50.297
Now that bites!

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.707
That a boy, Spike.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.754
Good boy, Spike.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.229
Look! It's Spike!

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.769
Ooh, nice save, dog.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.439
Good boy, Spike.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:31.484
But what are we going
to use for glue?

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:33.881
I'll take care of it.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.183
That gum won't stay
sticky for long.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:42.386
Places!
Let's go.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.546
Debbie?

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:45.758
Don't worry, Mom.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.118
I'm on it.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.384
Got it!

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.140
Pedal!

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:27.258
It's working!

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:44.377
* And on his farm

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:48.823
* He had a oceanospirillum
multiglouliferum *

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:52.721
* E-I-E-I-O.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:10:00.632
Can we go home now,
Mr. Strawberry?

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.853
We've got 'em!

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.594
Now let's reel 'em in.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:27.463
Nigel,

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:29.331
is everybody okay down there?

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:30.559
Excellent, dearest.

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:32.504
Well, one little girl is
rather pouty

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:38.369
and somebody needs a diaper
change-- I won't say whom.

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:43.008
Smashing!

01:10:43.039 --> 01:10:45.379
Why, it's the architeuthis,

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:49.379
commonly known
as the giant squid.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.949
Isn't she magnificent?

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.885
If only I had a camera...

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.492
Here,
Mr. Strawberry...

01:11:01.525 --> 01:11:02.855
60 feet long

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:06.602
and two tons of boneless flesh.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.040
Oh,
your picture

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:13.538
didn't come out.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.440
Well, that's probably
as it should be.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.643
You see, children,
the giant squid

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:21.605
has never been seen alive
before.

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:26.915
I suppose this marvel of nature
will be our little secret.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.650
What do you say?

01:11:31.955 --> 01:11:34.315
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:52.436
Here I am!

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:59.419
Mommy!
Daddy!

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.693
Dil!

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:02.718
Susie!

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.622
Where's Tommy?

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:07.824
And who does this little chap
belong to?

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:12.534
He's ours.

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:25.439
Come here, champ.

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:26.575
Honey,

01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:28.580
I'd like you
to meet Stu Pickles.

01:12:28.612 --> 01:12:32.582
He made the coconut radio
that saved your lives.

01:12:32.616 --> 01:12:35.986
Terribly grateful,
Mr. Pickles.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.149
I have a feeling
I wouldn't be here

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.917
without this
little chap, either.

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:47.263
Pickles!

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.565
You might grow up

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.140
to be just like
Nigel Strawberry after all.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:55.170
Thanks, Angelica.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:13:00.014
But I think I'll grow up
to be just like my daddy.

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:02.053
Well, bro, I got
to hand it to you...

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:03.148
I'm so proud of you, Stu.

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:06.819
Oh, Nigel,
I was so worried.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.490
I confess, I was, too.

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:10.988
I hated the thought
of our last family meal

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:15.790
being shortchanged because
we had to go find a leopard.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.660
Your father's right.

01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:21.565
We lost sight
of what's important--

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:24.128
spending time together.

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:28.811
Okay, everyone.

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:30.468
Let's pack up.

01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:31.777
We're going on vacation!

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.040
How about...

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:37.178
The Lipschitz Cruise!

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:39.623
We're leaving to go on vacation.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.049
Oh, yeah, right on.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.419
Ya-hoo!

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:55.969
* Here comes Spike
the dog again *

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:58.029
* With babies and a chill

01:13:58.067 --> 01:13:59.637
* Got a talking girl

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:04.639
* We're going on
another road trip *

01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:08.714
Well, Eliza,
as dog is my witness,

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:11.545
I'll never lose my babies again!

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:14.951
* I've been howling since
I bought my ticket *

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:16.854
* Somethin' called love

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:18.956
* Yeah, somethin' called love

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:24.558
* I'm through chasing
all the kitty cats *

01:14:24.594 --> 01:14:28.974
* Well, I'm just a modern dog

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:34.138
* You've seen me
chasing my tail before *

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:36.240
* Gotta lust for life

01:14:36.272 --> 01:14:38.242
* A lust for life *

01:14:38.274 --> 01:14:41.284
* I gotta lust for life

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.650
* Ooh *

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:46.119
* I gotta lust for life

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:47.779
* Ooh *

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:51.047
* I gotta lust for life

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.057
* Ooh

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:55.789
* Whoa, lust for life

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:56.855
* Ooh *

01:14:56.893 --> 01:15:00.233
* Yeah, I got lust for life

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:02.173
* Ooh *

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:05.128
* I gotta lust for life

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:06.998
* Ooh *

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.936
* I gotta lust for life

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.613
* Ooh *

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:14.181
* I gotta lust for life.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:25.893
* Hey-hoo

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.122
* Hey-hoo

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:28.016
What's that?

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:30.027
* Hey-hoo

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:36.099
* I woke up in the mist
on a desert isle *

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:44.636
* I dreamt that I was kissed
by a crocodile *

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:50.754
* Oh, yeah, yeah,
must be lizard love *

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:57.920
* I think this must be love
'cause I just got shined *

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:05.804
* Like Tarzan kissing Jane
for the very first time *

01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:10.999
* Oh, whoa, whoa,
must be lizard love *

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:19.809
* Oh, whoa, whoa,
I call it lizard love *

01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:21.143
* It's a jungle love lover

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:26.677
* It's the kind that likes
to kiss and tell *

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:29.946
* It's a little bit of heaven,
24/7

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:35.156
* Riding life
on the back of a gazelle *

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:54.714
* A let-down voodoo bee
will make you do the do *

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:57.854
* And you can blame it
on the heat *

01:16:57.881 --> 01:17:01.151
* I put a spell on you

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:07.661
* Oh, whoa, whoa,
must be lizard love *

01:17:09.425 --> 01:17:14.825
* Oh, whoa, whoa,
I call it lizard love *

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.095
* At first I thought
I was dreaming *

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.805
* Then I'd wake up
and she'd disappear *

01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:26.739
* But by the time
we got to Jurassic Park *

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:29.006
* She was laughing
and screaming *

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:34.945
* Swinging from a chandelier.

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:00.941
* Here we go, another day

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:03.407
* Looking for another way

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:07.376
* Tired of taking
the back seat *

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.446
* Mm-hmm

01:18:08.484 --> 01:18:11.194
* Carry on from place to place

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:14.090
* Hold our heads up,
smile with grace *

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:19.063
* No time for tears
and no escape *

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:23.965
* Hold on, can you save me?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.870
* Take off your shoes
and sit for a while *

01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:36.505
* I'd like to know if you hear
what I'm saying now *

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:38.205
* Oh

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:42.447
* Stop changing faces

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:44.185
* Oh, it's time to go home

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:50.230
* I'm so tired of this game
we play *

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:53.359
* Changing places

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:54.856
* Take a look in these eyes

01:18:54.898 --> 01:19:01.868
* There's so much more
that we need to say *

01:19:01.905 --> 01:19:04.535
* Tired of fighting
to be heard *

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.443
* I've been waiting,
when's my turn? *

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:11.046
* I hold my heart out
up to you *

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.820
* Uh-huh

01:19:12.849 --> 01:19:15.249
* So many things
we all have learned *

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:18.394
* I count the blessings
with every turn *

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:22.791
* Can't forget my faith in you

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:28.872
* How nice to be ordinary

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:32.398
* Time out,
can't pretend any more *

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:40.875
* I'd like to know if you hear
what I'm saying now *

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:49.820
* I'd like to be myself
for a while, just me *

01:19:49.853 --> 01:19:54.163
* Stop changing faces

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:56.230
* Oh, it's time to go home

01:19:56.259 --> 01:20:02.029
* I'm so tired of this game
we play *

01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:04.925
* Changing places

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:06.938
* Take a look
in these eyes *

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:12.880
* There's so much more
that we need to say *

01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:15.479
* Changing faces

01:20:15.511 --> 01:20:17.581
* Oh, it's time to go home

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:23.393
* I'm so tired of this game
we play *

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:26.089
* Changing places

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:28.592
* Take a look in these eyes

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:29.494
* There's so much more...
