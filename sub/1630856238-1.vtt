NARRATOR:
Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.292 --> 00:04.958
This is the year. Let's do it.

00:05.125 --> 00:06.458
NARRATOR:
...a special two-hour premiere.

00:06.625 --> 00:10.042
That story can be finished,
and I'm committed

00:10.167 --> 00:12.375
-to doing that.
-Amen. Let's go.

00:12.542 --> 00:15.417
MARTY:
I want to throw every resource
we can at it this year.

00:15.625 --> 00:17.792
STEVE:
So, this location's
where the treasure could be.

00:17.958 --> 00:19.667
MARTY:
We're clearly into a collapsed

00:19.875 --> 00:21.250
chamber of some sort.

00:21.458 --> 00:25.292
The scientists say metals
are coming out of here.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.375
That's a big enough box
for an offset chamber.

00:28.542 --> 00:29.917
-LAIRD: Marty.
-What do you think it is?

00:30.083 --> 00:31.458
LAIRD:
Could be a trapdoor.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.125
-Wow.
-Yeah!

00:33.292 --> 00:34.625
-(laughter)
-It's a coin!

00:36.583 --> 00:37.958
That is fantastic.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.250
JACK:
Good luck, Tony.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.167
He's getting right down into it.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.333
He's got his head
into something now.

00:43.458 --> 00:44.542
ALEX:
Yeah.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.958
Oh. No, that's not modern.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.083
This is probably BC.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.333
MARTY:
Holy smokes.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.750
(laughter)

00:56.917 --> 01:00.042
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

01:00.208 --> 01:02.500
where people
have been looking for

01:02.708 --> 01:06.500
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.375
So far, they have found
a stone slab

01:09.542 --> 01:12.167
with strange symbols
carved into it...

01:13.208 --> 01:16.167
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

01:16.333 --> 01:20.625
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

01:20.792 --> 01:22.125
to the Knights Templar.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.667
To date, six men have died

01:24.833 --> 01:27.458
trying to solve the mystery.

01:27.625 --> 01:32.500
And according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:32.708 --> 01:35.583
before the treasure
can be found.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.125
♪ ♪

01:48.417 --> 01:52.042
MARTY:
Well, how does everybody feel
about being back?

01:52.250 --> 01:53.458
How can you not be excited?

01:53.625 --> 01:55.583
JACK:
Yeah. I've had the feeling

01:55.750 --> 01:57.833
that we're about to find
the treasure this year.

01:58.042 --> 02:00.333
Jack, let's have
a little optimism here.

02:00.542 --> 02:02.875
(laughter)

02:03.083 --> 02:07.375
NARRATOR:
The most highly-anticipated
and potentially historic chapter

02:07.542 --> 02:11.000
of the 228-year-old
Oak Island mystery

02:11.167 --> 02:13.000
is about to begin.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.000
MARTY:
I want to throw every resource

02:15.167 --> 02:16.875
we can at it this year,
because

02:17.042 --> 02:18.833
I think we're closer
than we have ever been.

02:18.958 --> 02:20.167
We'll do whatever it takes
this year.

02:20.375 --> 02:23.000
-There you go.
-Yeah.

02:23.083 --> 02:26.208
NARRATOR:
Dating back to 1795,

02:26.417 --> 02:28.917
generations
of determined searchers

02:29.042 --> 02:30.667
have found startling clues

02:30.792 --> 02:34.000
that suggest a vast treasure
could be buried

02:34.208 --> 02:36.625
in a more than 100-foot-deep

02:36.792 --> 02:40.458
booby-trapped shaft
known as the Money Pit.

02:40.583 --> 02:43.333
And after spending
more than a decade

02:43.417 --> 02:45.333
on their own quest for answers,

02:45.500 --> 02:48.042
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
have returned,

02:48.208 --> 02:50.208
along with their team,

02:50.375 --> 02:52.042
to fulfill the dream

02:52.208 --> 02:54.750
they've shared
since they were just boys.

02:54.917 --> 02:58.167
MARTY: All right, there
she be, guys, in all her glory.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.792
Oak Island.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.583
As I drive up to the island,

03:01.750 --> 03:04.083
my expectation is that this year
we will figure it out.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.167
The main reason is that
the data supports that.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.500
And a lot of data
points to gold and silver

03:10.667 --> 03:12.833
in the water
in the Money Pit area.

03:13.042 --> 03:16.167
So, I do feel in my heart
that this has to be the year.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.000
Big brother, let's get 'er done.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.667
Let's do it.

03:20.792 --> 03:23.292
There's a wonderful mystery
here ensconced

03:23.458 --> 03:25.750
within an island
in the North Atlantic

03:25.917 --> 03:28.125
that has endured centuries long.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.833
Okay, guys.
Let's go see the team.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.792
RICK:
And my expectation is...

03:35.208 --> 03:36.708
...that we'll be able
to solve it.

03:36.875 --> 03:38.208
That's my hope.

03:38.375 --> 03:39.333
DOUG:
Hey, guys.

03:39.542 --> 03:40.833
Gentlemen.

03:41.042 --> 03:42.042
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.333
MARTY:
We're back. (chuckles)

03:43.500 --> 03:44.750
RICK:
We are all together,

03:44.917 --> 03:46.750
all of us, the whole team.

03:46.917 --> 03:50.000
The fellowship is striving
to-to make that happen.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.667
Well, welcome, everybody.

03:52.792 --> 03:55.708
I see we have the rest of the
team up on the screen there.

03:55.875 --> 03:58.833
Which has grown to be
quite a group. Some new faces.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.458
And so, the purpose
of this meeting is to get us

04:01.583 --> 04:04.250
all together again and get us
all on the same page.

04:04.417 --> 04:07.667
-So, let's get to it.
-GARY: Before we get too far

04:07.875 --> 04:10.958
into talking about this year,
what about last year?

04:11.125 --> 04:12.542
(laughter)

04:12.708 --> 04:15.000
Well, that is a perfect segue,
because last year,

04:15.208 --> 04:18.958
at the end, what happened, Gary?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.417
Down at the bottom
of that Garden Shaft

04:21.583 --> 04:24.417
and getting
those nonferrous hits,

04:24.625 --> 04:26.625
and then having
to leave the shaft...

04:26.792 --> 04:28.167
(laughter)

04:28.333 --> 04:30.375
...I mean, oh, my God.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.333
NARRATOR:
Although the 82-foot-deep
structure

04:33.500 --> 04:35.625
known as the Garden Shaft

04:35.708 --> 04:38.500
is not believed to be
the original Money Pit--

04:38.667 --> 04:41.167
which was lost
in the 19th century

04:41.375 --> 04:44.375
due to constant digging
by previous searchers--

04:44.542 --> 04:48.000
last year, after wood samples
from the structure

04:48.208 --> 04:51.708
were scientifically dated
to 1735

04:51.875 --> 04:55.375
and water samples produced
high-trace evidence of gold,

04:55.542 --> 04:57.583
the Oak Island team commissioned

04:57.750 --> 05:01.333
a mining company named
Dumas Contracting Limited

05:01.458 --> 05:05.167
to remodel the shaft
for further exploration.

05:05.375 --> 05:06.917
-(device beeping)
-GARY (laughs): Oh!

05:07.083 --> 05:08.500
That's the best-sounding target.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.333
-That's nonferrous.
-RICK: Really?

05:10.542 --> 05:13.833
-Yeah.
-NARRATOR: Just before
they were forced to halt

05:13.958 --> 05:16.750
their search operations
due to the onset of winter...

05:16.875 --> 05:19.542
-MARTY: That's a screaming
large hit, isn't it?
-GARY: Yeah.

05:19.708 --> 05:22.958
NARRATOR:
...Rick, Marty, and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

05:23.167 --> 05:26.500
identified nonferrous--
or precious metal-- targets

05:26.625 --> 05:29.542
just below the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

05:29.708 --> 05:33.500
Now, once new permits
can be secured,

05:33.667 --> 05:37.375
Dumas will return to deepen
the shaft by 20 feet,

05:37.542 --> 05:40.208
with the potential
to construct lateral tunnels

05:40.375 --> 05:42.917
depending on what
is encountered below.

05:43.917 --> 05:47.500
GARY: Well, I'm hoping
we get down there again,

05:47.708 --> 05:49.375
because we know those hits
are there.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.542
Yeah, plans have been laid
for that.

05:50.708 --> 05:52.833
-Right.
-So, I'd like to hear,

05:52.958 --> 05:54.750
uh, Ian, from you.

05:54.917 --> 05:56.500
I've been a big believer
in this methodology--

05:56.708 --> 05:58.917
the gold in the water,
the silver in the water--

05:59.042 --> 06:01.125
for a long time, and those seem
to be concentrated there, too.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.917
-So, why don't you kind of
give us a recap on that?
-IAN: Yeah.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.417
You know, I'll pull Fred in--

06:05.583 --> 06:08.292
he's the real expert here--
but, uh,

06:08.458 --> 06:10.667
last year,
we were able to concentrate

06:10.833 --> 06:14.583
and be very confident
in the Baby Blob area.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.375
That's right.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.167
MATT:
All right,
that's the last sample.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.458
NARRATOR:
Over the past two years,

06:20.583 --> 06:24.292
geoscientist Dr. Ian Spooner
and his colleagues,

06:24.458 --> 06:27.458
including hydrogeologist
Dr. Fred Michel,

06:27.625 --> 06:31.667
have been analyzing water
samples from numerous boreholes

06:31.792 --> 06:35.167
that Rick, Marty, Craig
and the team have drilled

06:35.333 --> 06:38.708
over the past decade
in the Money Pit area.

06:38.875 --> 06:43.667
Incredibly, these tests have
identified evidence of gold,

06:43.792 --> 06:48.667
silver and other metals between
depths of 80 and 120 feet,

06:48.792 --> 06:51.208
with the highest concentrations
in a zone

06:51.375 --> 06:53.083
they have dubbed
the "Baby Blob."

06:53.208 --> 06:56.708
which sets just several feet
west of the Garden Shaft.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.292
It is also within this zone
that the team has encountered

07:00.417 --> 07:03.167
a believed tunnel
at a depth of 95 feet

07:03.292 --> 07:08.375
that appears to run almost
directly below the Garden Shaft.

07:09.417 --> 07:12.208
IAN: I think what's got us
particularly excited

07:12.375 --> 07:13.708
is that we've got
the area of interest

07:13.875 --> 07:15.500
narrowed down
to about a 20-foot radius

07:15.667 --> 07:17.750
around the Garden Shaft.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.708
-Well, that's a good start.
-Yeah.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.917
FRED:
Well, as some of the drilling
takes place this year,

07:24.083 --> 07:26.917
and looking at the data
from last year,

07:27.083 --> 07:29.583
I think we might be able
to narrow it down a bit more.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.625
-IAN: Right.
-MARTY: Well, that I consider

07:31.792 --> 07:33.417
-very good news.
-ALEX: Yeah.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.875
MARTY:
Okay, so,

07:35.083 --> 07:36.792
we're gonna chase these metals
until they--

07:36.958 --> 07:39.125
-we figure out what they mean.
We got that.
-Mm-hmm.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.917
We haven't given up yet on
the sonic drilling, too, right?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.292
Yes.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.583
-Right.
-So, if we can continue

07:45.750 --> 07:47.875
to narrow down this radius
that we've been supplied with

07:48.042 --> 07:49.333
from Ian and Fred,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.875
we can really narrow in
on the Money Pit.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.917
NARRATOR:
While the team awaits

07:55.042 --> 07:58.333
the return of Dumas
to deepen the Garden Shaft,

07:58.542 --> 08:00.292
they will continue
with their strategic

08:00.500 --> 08:04.000
core-drilling program
throughout the surrounding area.

08:04.167 --> 08:08.042
If any new boreholes produce
physical evidence of valuables,

08:08.250 --> 08:12.167
Rick, Marty and the team
will have exact locations

08:12.375 --> 08:14.250
for where tunnels
can be extended

08:14.417 --> 08:16.417
from the bottom
of the Garden Shaft

08:16.583 --> 08:19.667
to hopefully solve
the Oak Island mystery.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.417
STEVE:
Right now,
we've got the drill out there

08:22.583 --> 08:24.208
waiting for us to pin
our first location.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.125
And that's gonna give us
great information

08:26.292 --> 08:27.542
to where we need to tunnel to.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.667
Okay. Well, let's move on

08:29.875 --> 08:31.375
to something that was exciting
last year.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.917
So, Laird, why don't you
bring us up to speed

08:34.042 --> 08:35.958
on what you've planned
this year, archaeologically.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.500
And-and your team.

08:37.708 --> 08:40.000
Well, we have lots
of new members.

08:40.208 --> 08:41.833
We have Emma, of course.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.500
Uh, in the middle,
we have Jamie Kouba

08:44.667 --> 08:48.375
and to the left
is Moya MacDonald.

08:48.542 --> 08:51.583
Up above, we have Helen,
who's come back.

08:51.750 --> 08:55.292
And then Danny Hennigar,
who's a Oak Island historian.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.708
You got enough trowels?

08:56.875 --> 08:58.958
-We bought more trowels.
-More trowels?

08:59.167 --> 09:00.708
(laughter)

09:00.875 --> 09:02.500
NARRATOR:
Although the search

09:02.708 --> 09:04.375
for the legendary treasure vault

09:04.542 --> 09:07.042
remains focused
in the Money Pit area,

09:07.208 --> 09:11.500
last year, archaeologist
Laird Niven and his colleagues

09:11.708 --> 09:14.667
helped the team make
several stunning revelations

09:14.792 --> 09:17.083
in other areas of the island.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.917
These include Lot 26,

09:21.042 --> 09:24.000
where the team
investigated a stone wall

09:24.208 --> 09:26.583
that may be more than
five centuries old

09:26.708 --> 09:30.750
and of Portuguese design,
along with a stone well

09:30.875 --> 09:33.667
that could be
more than 800 years old,

09:33.792 --> 09:37.333
and which also contains
trace evidence of silver.

09:37.542 --> 09:40.500
However,
of all the recent discoveries

09:40.583 --> 09:42.708
made by the team on Oak Island,

09:42.875 --> 09:46.167
the most compelling
were unearthed on Lot 5,

09:46.375 --> 09:48.917
which was purchased in 2022

09:49.083 --> 09:51.708
from the estate of
the late Robert Young.

09:51.917 --> 09:54.750
It was on these four acres
that the team

09:54.917 --> 09:58.583
found half of a nearly
2,000-year-old Roman coin,

09:58.750 --> 10:01.750
a 14th-century lead barter token

10:01.875 --> 10:05.000
and a stone foundation
that could date back

10:05.167 --> 10:08.625
to the same era
as the Garden Shaft.

10:08.750 --> 10:12.167
-That's 13 feet.
-It's a bizarre measurement.

10:12.375 --> 10:17.000
NARRATOR:
But the most curious structure
that was investigated on Lot 5

10:17.125 --> 10:21.708
was a circular stone depression
featuring a 13-foot diameter.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.292
A measurement
that is an exact match

10:25.375 --> 10:27.875
to the reported description
of the Money Pit,

10:28.042 --> 10:31.375
when it was discovered in 1795.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.208
Where are you starting?

10:35.333 --> 10:36.667
The circular feature on Lot 5.

10:36.875 --> 10:39.542
-We're gonna expand that search.
-Mm-hmm.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.000
And actually,
Danny's just recently brought

10:41.167 --> 10:43.583
some photographs
that shed some light

10:43.708 --> 10:45.875
-on the circular feature.
-Okay.

10:46.042 --> 10:47.667
So, I have some pictures
from Laird and Danny.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.875
-I'll share them.
-DANNY H.: In the photographs

10:50.042 --> 10:52.417
that we, uh, received
from the Robert Young family,

10:52.583 --> 10:56.458
it has an enormous amount
of rocks around the structure.

10:56.625 --> 11:00.458
LAIRD:
I don't think those rocks
came out of the feature.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.208
SCOTT:
This looks like the progression
of how it's being built.

11:03.375 --> 11:04.833
LAIRD:
Right.

11:05.042 --> 11:08.333
Robert Young created
the stone circles

11:08.458 --> 11:10.333
around the depression.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.375
RICK:
Wow. Look at that.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.333
-Robert Young did all that?
-Yeah.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.333
LAIRD:
Yes, but he didn't dig
the depression.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.667
MARTY:
It's like he thought this thing
was really important,

11:19.833 --> 11:22.000
so he built this beautiful
apron around it.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.083
-LAIRD: Exactly.
-MARTY: And you find stuff--

11:24.250 --> 11:26.167
lots of stuff--
from the earliest,

11:26.333 --> 11:30.333
1700-dated things we found
on the island, correct?

11:30.542 --> 11:31.833
Yeah.

11:32.042 --> 11:34.458
MARTY:
It's very clear, Robert Young

11:34.625 --> 11:36.500
didn't build
that entire feature on Lot 5.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.000
It was already there.

11:38.167 --> 11:41.500
There's way too many
17th-century artifacts in there.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.667
We're going
to carefully deconstruct

11:43.875 --> 11:45.833
the piece he didn't build.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.625
The hope is the feature
had something to do

11:48.792 --> 11:51.667
with the deposit of treasure.

11:51.833 --> 11:54.000
Okay, the next topic is,

11:54.208 --> 11:57.167
of course,
my often nemesis: the swamp.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.500
-(laughter)
-But just about every time
we dig,

11:59.667 --> 12:01.833
something comes up.

12:02.042 --> 12:04.375
And some of it is
inexplicably old.

12:04.542 --> 12:05.833
-Really old.
-Yep.

12:06.042 --> 12:07.333
NARRATOR:
In recent years,

12:07.500 --> 12:08.958
the team has found evidence

12:09.083 --> 12:10.833
that the mysterious
triangle-shaped swamp

12:10.958 --> 12:12.667
in the middle of Oak Island

12:12.875 --> 12:16.167
is either partially
or completely man-made.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.958
And within it, they have
unearthed numerous pieces

12:19.125 --> 12:21.833
of ancient sailing vessels
dating anywhere

12:22.000 --> 12:24.875
from the seventh
to the 18th centuries.

12:25.042 --> 12:28.000
They have also uncovered
a stone road,

12:28.208 --> 12:31.333
an adjoining cobblestone pathway

12:31.417 --> 12:34.417
and a stone ramp
that all may be related

12:34.542 --> 12:37.708
to the stone wall on Lot 26.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.750
And finally,
a massive paved feature

12:40.917 --> 12:42.833
that is believed
to have been created

12:42.958 --> 12:45.917
as early as 1200 AD.

12:46.083 --> 12:49.500
So, we have, currently,
four areas of interest

12:49.708 --> 12:50.917
-that we've permitted.
-(mouse clicks)

12:51.083 --> 12:53.208
They're in bright yellow
on your screen.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.042
RICK:
So, we have
the southeast corner,

12:56.208 --> 12:59.708
the area off of Fred's peninsula
to the south,

12:59.875 --> 13:02.000
and then
we have the paved area.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.458
But I am positively fascinated

13:04.625 --> 13:06.500
with the north side
of the swamp.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.875
GARY:
Yep. That side of the island,

13:09.083 --> 13:10.583
maybe we should send
Tony Sampson

13:10.708 --> 13:12.625
and have a look around.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.333
RICK:
Every time Tony dove

13:14.500 --> 13:15.625
in the waters around Oak Island,

13:15.750 --> 13:17.333
y-you know,
he's found something.

13:17.500 --> 13:21.333
So, I, absolutely, am convinced
that a dive should happen.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.833
Yes.

13:23.042 --> 13:24.833
-I think we should do that.
-JACK: Great.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.833
It looks like
we have a very busy year.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.833
CRAIG:
Well, every area

13:29.042 --> 13:31.000
we've talked about,
I'm excited to get into.

13:31.125 --> 13:34.958
I just think there's so much
to learn yet on this island,

13:35.125 --> 13:37.583
and hopefully, this is the year.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.833
-Yep. Beautiful.
-RICK: As I look
around this table

13:40.000 --> 13:42.833
and I see the fervor
in people's eyes,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.667
that story can be finished,

13:45.750 --> 13:47.042
and I'm committed to doing that.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.000
And I know
that all of you are as well.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.792
Absolutely.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.500
Amen. Let's go.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.375
Okay, let's get going.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.167
The mystery will get solved.

13:56.375 --> 14:01.958
MARTY:
So, let's get to it,
big brother.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.792
TERRY:
All right, here we go.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.250
-Hey, guys.
-STEVE: Hey, Alex.
How you doing?

14:05.417 --> 14:06.792
-Alex. How you doing?
-Good.
-Hey, Alex.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.833
So, first hole of the year.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.625
-STEVE: Yep.
-Absolutely.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.500
NARRATOR: Following their
meeting in the war room,

14:13.708 --> 14:16.708
Alex Lagina joins other members
of the Oak Island team

14:16.875 --> 14:19.417
in the Money Pit area

14:19.542 --> 14:22.875
as they begin drilling a new
six-inch-diameter borehole

14:23.042 --> 14:28.375
on their strategic grid
known as B5N13.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.875
-So, we have the Garden Shaft,
which is right there.
-Yep.

14:31.042 --> 14:32.583
STEVE:
So, this location's
really interesting

14:32.750 --> 14:35.875
because Dr. Spooner and
Dr. Michel put a 20-foot radius

14:36.042 --> 14:38.333
around the Garden Shaft
where the treasure could be.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.292
-And we're right
into that location.
-Yeah.

14:40.375 --> 14:43.417
NARRATOR:
Located between
the so-called Baby Blob

14:43.542 --> 14:46.750
and the Garden Shaft,
it is the team's hope

14:46.958 --> 14:50.667
that Borehole B5N13
will make direct contact

14:50.875 --> 14:55.167
with the mysterious source
of gold, silver and other metals

14:55.333 --> 14:57.958
that have been detected
in the area between a depth

14:58.125 --> 15:01.292
of 80 and 120 feet.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.667
So, this is gonna help us
gather more information

15:03.833 --> 15:06.167
because the end goal
of this is, really,

15:06.375 --> 15:08.792
dig the Garden Shaft deeper
and tunnel out.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.625
So, we need a location
to tunnel out to,

15:10.792 --> 15:12.125
and potentially,
this could be the area.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.792
Yes.

15:13.958 --> 15:15.333
RICK:
The sonic drill program

15:15.500 --> 15:17.125
is gonna be important
and informative.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.667
The one evocative thought
from all of us is,

15:19.792 --> 15:21.458
"This is the hole.

15:21.625 --> 15:25.125
This is where we're gonna nail
this thing and this'll be done."

15:25.208 --> 15:27.083
So, I'm very hopeful.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.000
-It's looking good.
-Yeah.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.333
Keep your fingers crossed.
We'll see what it brings up.

15:31.542 --> 15:34.167
-TERRY: Absolutely.
-NARRATOR: As the core
drilling operation

15:34.292 --> 15:36.750
continues at the Money Pit,

15:36.917 --> 15:42.083
on Lot 5, located on
the western side of the island,

15:42.208 --> 15:46.417
Jack Begley joins
archaeologists Laird Niven,

15:46.583 --> 15:51.042
Jamie Kouba and their assistant
Fiona Steele to continue

15:51.208 --> 15:55.208
investigating the mysterious
circular stone depression...

15:55.375 --> 15:56.792
JACK:
So, where are we starting?

15:56.917 --> 15:58.333
-Over... Okay.
-Right here.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.333
NARRATOR:
...a feature that is now known

16:00.417 --> 16:02.542
to have been altered
by the late Robert Young,

16:02.708 --> 16:05.708
but which is believed
to possibly date back

16:05.875 --> 16:08.333
to at least
the mid-18th century.

16:08.542 --> 16:11.583
The main goal is
to expose the bottom,

16:11.792 --> 16:16.125
but also to look for the south
wall that we hope is there.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.125
If this was a dwelling,
it should have

16:18.292 --> 16:20.000
a foundational wall.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.125
-Well, let's get started.
-All right.

16:22.292 --> 16:23.958
So, did you have
any particular area

16:24.083 --> 16:25.667
where you'd like to get started?

16:25.833 --> 16:27.000
I was kind of thinking here...

16:27.208 --> 16:28.500
-Yeah.
-...at this sort of point.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.083
-Take that lump down.
-Okay.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.042
Your goal is to expose
the top of the rocks.

16:33.208 --> 16:35.417
-FIONA: Perfect. Okay.
-All right. Let's do it.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.375
NARRATOR:
As Jamie and Fiona
carefully remove sediment

16:38.542 --> 16:41.458
from the rock layer that
Mr. Young added to the feature

16:41.583 --> 16:43.542
some 20 years ago,

16:43.708 --> 16:46.375
Laird and Jack begin
sifting those materials

16:46.542 --> 16:49.083
for any artifacts
that may help identify

16:49.208 --> 16:51.542
who originally created it.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.167
FIONA:
Jamie, look at this.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.875
-Look.
-JAMIE: What'd you find?

16:56.042 --> 16:57.958
FIONA:
I'm finding
some red earthenware here.

16:58.042 --> 16:59.667
That's exciting.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.208
Hey, Laird.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.917
You might want to come have
a look at this.

17:04.042 --> 17:06.833
-All righty.
-That's incredible.

17:06.958 --> 17:08.542
I think we found some redware.

17:11.208 --> 17:14.000
LAIRD:
Wow. That's cool.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.042
NARRATOR:
Redware, which is a type

17:17.208 --> 17:20.333
of earthenware pottery
made from fired clay,

17:20.500 --> 17:23.125
was a widely used material
for the storage and transport

17:23.292 --> 17:26.042
of goods in both Europe
and North America

17:26.208 --> 17:29.792
between the 17th
and 18th centuries.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.042
It's just that the glaze is...

17:34.000 --> 17:35.167
...unusual.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.167
It's kind of purple and black.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.833
We see a lot
of coarse earthenwares,

17:38.958 --> 17:40.167
a lot of redwares.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.917
-Yeah.
-So when we can't recognize it,

17:44.042 --> 17:45.708
we immediately wonder
if it's earlier.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.333
-Okay.
-Right?

17:47.542 --> 17:49.000
JACK:
How early do you think
it could be?

17:49.208 --> 17:50.583
LAIRD:
Oh...

17:50.708 --> 17:53.500
in general,
it can get into the 1600s.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.708
Wow. Great find.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.417
Yeah.

17:57.583 --> 17:59.417
JACK:
If there were people
settling here,

17:59.583 --> 18:04.000
and-and it happened before
the discovery of the Money Pit,

18:04.208 --> 18:06.375
uh, did they have knowledge
of the Money Pit,

18:06.500 --> 18:10.708
and is there a reason why
they-they dug around this area?

18:10.917 --> 18:13.583
-Right.
-I'm wondering if the answers
are deeper.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.250
LAIRD:
Oh, absolutely.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.208
The further down we go,
the older the artifacts.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.125
Yep.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.583
All right.
I still have to screen.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.167
I kind of like getting dirty.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.000
-(laughs) You got
Jamie's bucket?
-Sure.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.708
-Okay.
-Why, thank you, sir.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.000
LAIRD:
I'm actually excited
about the round feature.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.708
This is an indication

18:31.875 --> 18:33.583
that there were people
living on the island

18:33.708 --> 18:35.958
before the 1760s,
before the island

18:36.125 --> 18:38.625
was divided up into lots.

18:38.750 --> 18:42.625
So, this is a new and exciting
and unknown occupation.

18:42.708 --> 18:44.375
Okay, guys.

18:44.542 --> 18:45.958
Here's our hardworking
archaeologists,

18:46.167 --> 18:47.917
and this is our playground
right here.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.833
-RICK: Good morning.
-JAMIE: Morning.

18:50.042 --> 18:52.708
Ladies, gentlemen, what's new?

18:52.917 --> 18:55.042
LAIRD: We found a nice piece
of, uh, coarse earthenware.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.833
One that I can't...
I don't recognize.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.333
Really? Okay.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.583
What is strange about
this piece of pottery?

19:02.792 --> 19:05.375
Um, purple glaze on the rim

19:05.583 --> 19:06.958
and the dark glaze
on the interior,

19:07.042 --> 19:09.208
I just don't recognize.

19:09.375 --> 19:11.875
Laird, if there's a piece
of pottery you don't recognize,

19:12.042 --> 19:13.542
-it's likely to be older, right?
-Exactly.

19:13.708 --> 19:15.125
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:15.292 --> 19:16.750
RICK:
What's the earliest
that could be?

19:16.875 --> 19:18.708
LAIRD:
1600s.

19:18.875 --> 19:22.667
What brings it back to 1600?
That's quite early.

19:22.833 --> 19:24.583
This is utilitarian pottery,

19:24.708 --> 19:27.375
so it doesn't change over--
much over time.

19:28.917 --> 19:31.500
When Laird,
who is a pottery expert,

19:31.708 --> 19:35.500
uh, says, "Guys,
this is an inexplicable find,

19:35.708 --> 19:38.625
I've never seen
such earthenware before,"

19:38.833 --> 19:42.208
I mean, how can you say
anything but "Wow"?

19:42.375 --> 19:44.958
If Laird is mystified,
we certainly are.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.667
Can Gary do a little perimeter?

19:48.833 --> 19:50.458
He can if he wants.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.250
-Oh, you know I want.
-(laughter)

19:53.417 --> 19:54.625
-RICK: Go for it, Gary.
-MARTY: Get in there, Gary.

19:54.792 --> 19:55.667
GARY:
All right.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.667
LAIRD:
I remember last year, you said
it was really noisy in there.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.167
GARY:
Yeah, it is.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.792
(device beeping)

20:03.958 --> 20:05.167
JACK:
That means there's
a lot more to find.

20:05.333 --> 20:07.042
LAIRD:
There you go.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.333
GARY:
Yeah, there's a lot of iron.

20:13.708 --> 20:16.125
-JACK: Is that something?
-Yeah, it's iron.

20:16.292 --> 20:18.458
It's a large piece of iron.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.167
MARTY:
All right, well,
let's keep going.

20:20.375 --> 20:22.000
Let's get out here
and see what we got.

20:22.167 --> 20:24.333
Yep. Let's keep rolling.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
RICK:
Okay, Gary, it's all up to you.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.083
-Right, uh, let's...
-Uh, are you gonna,
do you want to start

20:28.208 --> 20:29.875
-some kind of pattern?
-Yeah.

20:30.042 --> 20:32.250
Uh, let's grid this out.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.625
Lot 5 is a complete mystery.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.167
We're going to have Gary

20:37.333 --> 20:39.250
metal-detect around
the circular feature

20:39.458 --> 20:42.583
to see what other artifacts
might be found.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.500
-I'm happy to screen for a bit
if you want to get down...
-All right.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.167
-...and do some trowel work.
-Yep.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.250
JACK:
I'll find everything.

20:48.417 --> 20:50.333
The Lot 5 feature
is extraordinary

20:50.500 --> 20:53.167
because there's no record
of any habitation there.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.167
Every other feature
we've found on the island,

20:55.375 --> 20:57.250
we kind of know about.

20:57.417 --> 21:01.042
Lot 5, there's no record
of anybody ever living there.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.250
FIONA:
Look at this, Laird.

21:03.375 --> 21:04.917
It's much thicker
than what we found before.

21:05.042 --> 21:06.333
LAIRD:
Oh, yeah.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.500
And yet, we're still not
to the bottom of it.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.042
It's a coarse earthenware.

21:11.208 --> 21:12.917
So it could be older.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.042
-FIONA: Neat.
-Yep.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.167
That'll clean up nicely.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.833
I couldn't stay away.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.833
-You got a bucket
ready to go there?
-FIONA: Actually, we do.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.292
MARTY:
Okay. Hand me
the bucket, let's go.

21:24.458 --> 21:25.667
I'm gonna try one.

21:28.292 --> 21:29.792
Okay. Now hold that.

21:29.917 --> 21:30.958
-Yep...
-I'll do this.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.667
We'll see if I can
find something, just for grins.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.292
(chuckles)

21:38.208 --> 21:40.042
-All right.
-JAMIE: Much easier.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.708
MARTY:
Yes. Much easier.

21:43.833 --> 21:45.500
-Marty?
-Yes, sir.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.333
Remember the metal hit
Gary got here?

21:47.542 --> 21:49.333
-I sure do, yeah.
-I think I have it.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.917
-Really? What is it?
-It's big.

21:52.042 --> 21:54.833
Is it? Good, I'll come
down there and have a look.

21:55.042 --> 21:56.542
-Okay.
-Show me, Laird.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.917
JAMIE:
Wow.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.000
MARTY:
Well, that's a good
CAT scan thing.

22:01.167 --> 22:02.583
LAIRD:
Yep. (chuckles)

22:02.708 --> 22:04.833
-What do you think it is?
-I don't know.

22:05.042 --> 22:06.917
Let me see it, Laird.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.333
-I think Emma's gonna
be excited with it.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.750
-It's pretty solid.
-JAMIE: Yeah.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.875
MARTY:
It looks like a latch, Laird.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.208
MARTY:
This goes like that.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.500
-I think it is a latch
of some sort.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

22:22.708 --> 22:24.875
Could be a cellar door.
Could be a trapdoor.

22:25.042 --> 22:27.458
-Wow.
-MARTY: Yeah.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.208
NARRATOR:
An iron latch?

22:29.375 --> 22:32.917
Possibly from a cellar
or trapdoor?

22:33.042 --> 22:35.083
Could it be related
to the pottery

22:35.250 --> 22:37.292
that Laird believes
might date back

22:37.500 --> 22:39.875
to as early as the 1600s?

22:40.042 --> 22:42.917
And might it also be evidence
that this feature

22:43.083 --> 22:45.667
was created
in order to hide something?

22:45.833 --> 22:51.167
If so, what might the team
find deeper below?

22:51.375 --> 22:53.667
MARTY:
That is rather unique, Laird.

22:53.833 --> 22:56.500
-LAIRD: Yeah.
-I would like to take that
straight to the lab.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.333
-Okay. All right.
-Thank you, sir.

22:58.500 --> 22:59.708
Find some more stuff.

22:59.917 --> 23:01.792
-LAIRD: See you later.
-See you.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
NARRATOR:
While the investigation
continues on Lot 5...

23:06.250 --> 23:07.333
CHARLES:
We got a core, gentlemen.

23:07.542 --> 23:08.750
MIKE M.:
This here is 88.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.792
-TERRY: What've we got? 88?
-Yep.

23:10.917 --> 23:13.208
NARRATOR:
...back in the Money Pit area,

23:13.375 --> 23:15.458
members of the team
continue monitoring

23:15.667 --> 23:18.833
the core drilling operation,
which has just reached

23:18.958 --> 23:23.667
the believed treasure zone
between 80 and 120 feet deep.

23:27.042 --> 23:30.083
-It's dense, eh, Charles?
-CHARLES: It is very dense.

23:30.292 --> 23:32.000
CHARLES:
Yeah.

23:32.167 --> 23:33.583
TERRY:
Look at that.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.625
That's pretty soft material
right there.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.167
-That's interesting.
-Yep.

23:39.333 --> 23:41.958
CHARLES:
You know, we hit a soft zone
in this borehole...

23:43.458 --> 23:44.792
ALEX:
Onto the next core.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.667
CHARLES:
But oftentimes, a soft area

23:46.875 --> 23:49.375
or a slushy area indicates
that you're close

23:49.542 --> 23:52.333
to a structure,
or a void, if you will.

23:52.542 --> 23:54.583
So, we're very excited
about this area.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.083
-What you got, Mike?
-MIKE M.: 109.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.833
TERRY:
109. Thank you.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.417
STEVE:
Terry, what do you think?

24:02.583 --> 24:04.583
Looks like we've hit
the soft zone.

24:04.750 --> 24:06.792
This is saturated and loose.

24:06.958 --> 24:10.667
So, maybe what lies beneath is
what caused this soft material.

24:10.792 --> 24:12.292
STEVE:
So, here's a piece
of information:

24:12.417 --> 24:14.667
only feet away is the Baby Blob.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.500
-The Baby Blob's
just north of this hole.
-ALEX: Yep.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.542
STEVE:
The highest source of the metals

24:18.708 --> 24:20.667
is just feet from this
in one of our testing holes.

24:20.875 --> 24:23.833
So, we're only about
two and a half to five feet away

24:24.042 --> 24:25.500
from the source
of where we're getting

24:25.708 --> 24:27.958
the highest precious metals:
gold, silver.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.833
TERRY:
Suffice it to say,
we're in an interesting area.

24:31.042 --> 24:32.958
ALEX:
Yes. We could be
looking at a change

24:33.125 --> 24:36.292
in density
propagating out from a void

24:36.417 --> 24:39.333
that's collapsed in and allowed
all the soil and earth around it

24:39.542 --> 24:41.167
to become less dense.

24:41.375 --> 24:42.625
TERRY:
Exactly.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.833
Charles, are we still
feeling like...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
like we might be close
to the original Money Pit here?

24:47.125 --> 24:49.542
Because there's the story
of the collapse...

24:49.708 --> 24:52.042
-Yeah.
-...which would create
an area like this.

24:52.208 --> 24:53.917
I-It's certainly possible, Alex.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.250
I mean, we don't know where
the original Money Pit was.

24:56.375 --> 24:57.667
-It's been lost.
-Yeah.

24:57.875 --> 24:59.458
For over 150 years,
it's been lost.

24:59.542 --> 25:02.000
-Yeah.
-So, i-it's very possible

25:02.167 --> 25:04.583
that that could be the tunnel
going from Shaft Six

25:04.708 --> 25:06.708
-to the Money Pit.
-Yeah.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.833
NARRATOR:
In 1861,

25:11.042 --> 25:14.250
while drilling straight down
into the original Money Pit,

25:14.417 --> 25:16.917
members of
the Oak Island Association

25:17.083 --> 25:19.167
encountered what
they believed to be

25:19.333 --> 25:24.667
two stacked treasure chests
at a depth of some 100 feet.

25:24.833 --> 25:27.833
Because of a believed
booby-trapped flood tunnel,

25:27.917 --> 25:31.625
they sunk an adjacent shaft,
known as Shaft Six,

25:31.792 --> 25:36.500
18 feet to the west
down to a depth of 118 feet

25:36.708 --> 25:39.542
and began tunneling laterally
toward the Money Pit,

25:39.667 --> 25:42.542
hoping to recover
the treasure from below.

25:42.708 --> 25:46.500
Unfortunately, just before
reaching their target,

25:46.708 --> 25:50.042
the tunnel filled with seawater,

25:50.208 --> 25:53.875
which soon caused a catastrophic
collapse in both shafts,

25:54.042 --> 25:57.125
leaving the underground tunnel
full of broken timbers,

25:57.292 --> 26:00.833
debris and possible
scattered treasure.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.292
ALEX:
Well, this could be
the aftermath

26:04.500 --> 26:06.792
-of a collapse like that.
-CHARLES: Yeah. Absolutely.

26:06.958 --> 26:08.458
Absolutely.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.417
NARRATOR:
Could the Oak Island team

26:10.583 --> 26:12.583
be close to locating the tunnel

26:12.708 --> 26:15.833
between Shaft Six
and the original Money Pit?

26:16.000 --> 26:17.833
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, Craig.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.833
NARRATOR: ...and perhaps
the source of precious metals

26:20.000 --> 26:21.667
that they have detected
in the area?

26:21.875 --> 26:24.208
-What you got, Mike?
-MIKE M.: Uh, 119.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.458
-119.
-Thank you.

26:26.542 --> 26:28.667
ALEX:
So, this is an exciting moment.

26:28.833 --> 26:31.458
What we're seeing today
could be the remains

26:31.625 --> 26:33.167
of the Shaft Six collapse,
which would mean

26:33.333 --> 26:35.583
that we've found
the original Money Pit.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.167
But it could also
be the remains of

26:37.250 --> 26:39.625
a more recent
collapsed searcher shaft.

26:39.833 --> 26:41.708
So, that's what we're trying
to answer with this borehole.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.542
CHARLES:
That's pretty dry.

26:44.708 --> 26:47.667
TERRY:
Yeah. This is relatively
firm material,

26:47.833 --> 26:51.542
and it looks like, uh...

26:51.708 --> 26:54.375
a mix of limestone
and sediments.

26:54.542 --> 26:56.208
Fairly regular stuff.

26:56.375 --> 26:59.917
We've moved out of the slush
zone probably about 114.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.625
-We're into classic sediments.
-CRAIG: Okay.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.458
STEVE:
We need a firm target
to tunnel to.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.833
Is this it?
At this point, probably not.

27:08.042 --> 27:10.458
But it's a great borehole
to help define the area.

27:10.625 --> 27:11.917
-Yeah.
-Yes.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.500
RICK:
The sonic drill program

27:13.667 --> 27:15.208
is a huge asset.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.083
The data that we are collecting
will provide information

27:18.208 --> 27:20.583
in terms of
what directions to tunnel

27:20.792 --> 27:22.458
at the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.292
But we have to be patient.

27:24.458 --> 27:27.042
I believe there's a very good
chance that whatever was

27:27.208 --> 27:30.667
put in place at the depths
in the Money Pit

27:30.833 --> 27:32.625
is still there,
and we're going to find it

27:32.750 --> 27:34.458
and we're going to dig it up.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.167
CRAIG:
Okay, guys.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.208
-We need to pick a new--
next location, so...
-STEVE: Yeah.

27:38.375 --> 27:40.833
CRAIG:
We'll get with Scott
and move the rig.

27:41.042 --> 27:42.333
-Okay.
-TERRY: See you later, Craig.

27:42.542 --> 27:43.667
CRAIG:
See you later.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.542
NARRATOR:
As a new morning
begins on Oak Island...

27:51.708 --> 27:54.250
-LAIRD: Hey, Marty.
-MARTY: Oh, yes,

27:54.417 --> 27:56.542
-there's our artifact.
-NARRATOR: ...Rick
and Marty Lagina,

27:56.708 --> 27:58.208
along with Craig Tester,

27:58.333 --> 28:00.167
arrive at
the Interpretive Centre.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.833
So, it's substantial.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.833
NARRATOR: They are meeting
with Laird Niven

28:04.042 --> 28:05.375
and archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan

28:05.542 --> 28:07.917
for an update on the iron latch

28:08.042 --> 28:11.125
that was found one day ago
on Lot 5.

28:11.292 --> 28:12.667
RICK: W-When you say
it's heavily encrusted,

28:12.875 --> 28:14.708
-it's heavily encrusted.
-(laughs): Yeah.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.208
So, I've just finished
a CT scan.

28:16.375 --> 28:17.625
So we'll go over that right now?

28:17.750 --> 28:20.208
NARRATOR:
Earlier this morning,

28:20.375 --> 28:22.000
Emma examined the artifact

28:22.167 --> 28:25.667
using the SkyScan 1273
CT scanner,

28:25.833 --> 28:30.167
a device which emits
nondestructive X-ray radiation

28:30.333 --> 28:32.792
that can penetrate
encrusted sediment

28:32.958 --> 28:36.333
that builds up on the surface
of objects over time.

28:36.542 --> 28:39.583
The process generates
clear images of artifacts

28:39.750 --> 28:41.833
and their finer details.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.917
LAIRD:
So, that's
the reconstructed image.

28:45.083 --> 28:48.083
MARTY:
It looks like a door knocker.
It's pointy.

28:48.208 --> 28:51.417
So, I'd say it was made
to be driven into something.

28:51.625 --> 28:54.833
Definitely been used. You can
see the top's been hammered.

28:55.042 --> 28:56.750
MARTY:
Were you able to do
a data search, Laird,

28:56.875 --> 28:58.542
to see what it is?

28:58.708 --> 29:00.167
Any light on that?

29:00.375 --> 29:02.708
The only thing I found
is that it was, um,

29:02.875 --> 29:05.125
it was a river-raft spike.

29:05.292 --> 29:07.958
But functionally,
you could use that for anything.

29:08.125 --> 29:10.167
Have you been able
to do any analysis?

29:10.375 --> 29:12.625
I've done an XRF map scan.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.875
So, it's really high in iron.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.125
-MARTY: Is there any manganese?
-No.

29:17.292 --> 29:20.333
-So, it's pre-1840, right?
That's kind of our benchmark?
-Mm-hmm.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.333
EMMA:
But what's really
interesting is that...

29:22.500 --> 29:23.667
now that we have a database

29:23.875 --> 29:25.167
and we've scanned
all these artifacts,

29:25.333 --> 29:28.333
I can go and compare it

29:28.542 --> 29:30.667
to the ones that we have.

29:30.833 --> 29:32.500
Does it match any
of our other stuff?

29:32.708 --> 29:33.875
No.

29:35.417 --> 29:37.292
MARTY:
So, Laird,

29:37.500 --> 29:38.625
-what do you make of this?
-LAIRD: I think it's odd.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.708
No, I-I mean...
(stammers)

29:40.875 --> 29:44.083
But what was a lot more
interesting, early in the year,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.875
I was contacted by a-a man
named Frank White

29:47.042 --> 29:49.000
who, um, follows
the Oak Island story.

29:49.208 --> 29:51.833
And he had some artifacts--

29:52.000 --> 29:53.250
some, uh,
archaeological artifacts--

29:53.417 --> 29:57.375
from the William Phips
birthplace in Maine.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.292
And he asked if we would do
analysis on the artifacts,

30:00.458 --> 30:02.208
so he sent them over.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.375
RICK:
Well, we all know
the William Phips story.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.000
It's the Concepción theory.

30:06.167 --> 30:08.750
And Phips is known to have
traveled in these waters.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.833
So, the idea
is that his treasure

30:12.000 --> 30:14.250
-was brought here to Oak Island.
-Right.

30:14.375 --> 30:18.750
Scott Clarke did a fantastic job
of laying out the parameters.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.042
Many people
are actually familiar

30:21.208 --> 30:24.875
with William Phips's discovery
of the Concepción back in 1687.

30:25.042 --> 30:27.500
We know that Phips found silver
on the Concepción,

30:27.667 --> 30:29.500
and I believe
some of the treasure

30:29.625 --> 30:32.083
from the Concepción
was secreted to Oak Island.

30:32.250 --> 30:34.208
NARRATOR:
Two years ago,

30:34.375 --> 30:37.417
32nd-degree Freemason
Scott Clarke presented research

30:37.583 --> 30:41.333
linking the 17th-century
English nobleman

30:41.458 --> 30:44.500
Sir William Phips
to the Oak Island mystery.

30:44.667 --> 30:49.208
In 1687, Phips located
the wreck of the Concepción,

30:49.375 --> 30:52.833
a Spanish galleon that sank
near the Dominican Republic

30:53.042 --> 30:56.167
in 1641
while attempting to transport

30:56.333 --> 31:00.375
more than 200 tons
of gold, silver and jewels

31:00.583 --> 31:02.000
back to Europe.

31:02.167 --> 31:05.375
After recovering
nearly 100 tons of silver

31:05.542 --> 31:07.042
during his initial salvage
of the wreck,

31:07.208 --> 31:10.333
Phips returned to the site
one year later

31:10.542 --> 31:13.167
with an assistant
named Andrew Belcher

31:13.375 --> 31:15.500
who was also
a high-ranking Freemason.

31:15.667 --> 31:20.000
However, after completing
this operation,

31:20.208 --> 31:23.042
they delivered
a much smaller bounty.

31:23.208 --> 31:25.500
During the second expedition
of the treasure,

31:25.667 --> 31:27.667
Phips brought back to England
what was only valued

31:27.875 --> 31:29.458
at 10,000 pounds.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.250
He literally found one twentieth
of what he found the first time.

31:32.417 --> 31:34.333
NARRATOR:
According
to Scott Clarke's theory,

31:34.542 --> 31:37.250
Sir William Phips
and Andrew Belcher,

31:37.417 --> 31:40.125
who is known to have owned land
near Oak Island,

31:40.292 --> 31:43.500
buried a vast amount
of their recovered treasure

31:43.667 --> 31:45.167
in the Money Pit.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.000
LAIRD:
So, Frank sent the artifacts

31:47.208 --> 31:50.000
from the William Phips site,
and we did the analysis.

31:50.167 --> 31:52.167
So, we're making
a comparison to that?

31:52.375 --> 31:53.625
-Yeah.
-EMMA: It's matching to that.

31:53.750 --> 31:54.875
So, it's matching really similar

31:55.042 --> 31:56.750
to the-the William Phips
artifact.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.000
-And-and nothing else?
-MARTY: But not ours?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.917
-EMMA: Nothing else.
-Is it definitive?

32:01.083 --> 32:04.333
That latch was 100% matching
to the William Phips site.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.167
That's astounding, Emma.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.917
NARRATOR:
A latch found

32:11.042 --> 32:13.208
in the circular depression
on Lot 5?

32:13.375 --> 32:16.083
An identical metallurgical match
to artifacts

32:16.208 --> 32:18.917
directly related
to Sir William Phips?

32:19.083 --> 32:21.958
Could that explain
not only the potentially

32:22.083 --> 32:24.750
17th-century pottery
recovered from the feature

32:24.917 --> 32:27.333
but also
the high-trace evidence

32:27.500 --> 32:29.583
of precious metals
in the Money Pit?

32:29.750 --> 32:30.958
Amazing.

32:31.125 --> 32:33.333
So... I mean, even the fact

32:33.500 --> 32:35.750
that it doesn't match
anything else...

32:35.875 --> 32:37.208
-EMMA: Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

32:37.375 --> 32:40.583
You don't get too many
100% sensitivity matches.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.333
I'm excited about it.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.292
-RICK: Yeah, it's cool.
It's very cool.
-Yeah.

32:44.458 --> 32:45.667
MARTY:
All right, well, we need him
to go back out there

32:45.875 --> 32:47.083
-and keep digging.
-(laughter)

32:47.208 --> 32:48.417
-LAIRD: That's right. Yep.
-Right?

32:48.583 --> 32:50.750
There could be all kinds
of more things in there.

32:50.958 --> 32:52.958
-This is really interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.875
-So, thank you.
-No problem.

32:55.042 --> 32:56.167
All righty. Thank you, Emma.
Thanks, Laird.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.333
MARTY:
Thank you, Emma. Thanks, Laird.

33:00.042 --> 33:01.667
NARRATOR:
Later that morning,

33:01.792 --> 33:05.250
while the archaeological team
continues investigating

33:05.458 --> 33:08.500
the circular stone depression
on Lot 5...

33:08.667 --> 33:10.208
-Head in here.
-Okey doke.

33:10.417 --> 33:11.875
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

33:12.042 --> 33:14.042
search the nearby area

33:14.208 --> 33:17.625
for additional clues
and evidence of valuables.

33:17.792 --> 33:20.458
We have flags here,
the potential of these finds

33:20.625 --> 33:25.500
helping us try to understand
that feature,

33:25.625 --> 33:26.958
it's-it's fairly elevated.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.542
NARRATOR:
Earlier today,

33:28.708 --> 33:31.333
in accordance
with provincial guidelines,

33:31.458 --> 33:34.625
Gary identified a number
of metallic targets,

33:34.833 --> 33:36.917
which Laird Niven
has now given him and Rick

33:37.042 --> 33:39.208
permission to retrieve.

33:39.375 --> 33:41.833
RICK:
Okay. Let's get after it.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.125
(device beeping)

33:46.917 --> 33:48.417
Little blippy signal.

33:49.542 --> 33:51.542
Let's see
if it's in the surface.

33:54.167 --> 33:56.042
(device beeping)

33:56.250 --> 33:57.792
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, yep.

33:57.958 --> 34:00.125
That is more than likely
surface junk.

34:00.292 --> 34:02.167
Okay, where's the next flag?

34:02.333 --> 34:03.792
Uh, right at
the side of us, mate.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.833
Oh.

34:07.042 --> 34:08.292
Okay.

34:10.208 --> 34:12.625
(device beeping)

34:12.792 --> 34:15.042
There we go. That's better.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.583
Good-sounding target, mate.
Just there.

34:20.542 --> 34:21.583
RICK:
Wow.

34:23.042 --> 34:24.708
-(chuckles)
-It's tough digging, isn't it?

34:27.708 --> 34:29.083
I'm just gonna take the top off,

34:29.250 --> 34:30.667
and you can kind of
pinpoint it, all right?

34:30.875 --> 34:31.708
Yep.

34:32.875 --> 34:33.833
Can't be that deep.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.583
(device beeping)

34:37.083 --> 34:39.208
(high-pitched beep)

34:42.875 --> 34:44.917
-It's in my hand.
-(rapid beeping)

34:45.083 --> 34:47.458
Let's see what we've got.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.000
(chuckles)
Look at that.

34:55.208 --> 34:56.333
RICK:
Wow.

35:00.458 --> 35:02.167
(laughs): I think we've got
a coin! Look at that.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.708
That looks like a really,
really old coin, mate.

35:04.875 --> 35:08.792
NARRATOR:
On Lot 5, located on
the western side of Oak Island,

35:08.875 --> 35:12.000
Gary Drayton and Rick Lagina
have just unearthed

35:12.167 --> 35:16.125
another potentially important
and valuable clue.

35:16.292 --> 35:18.542
-That's a coin, mate.
-(chuckles)

35:18.708 --> 35:22.417
And that could potentially
be really, really old.

35:22.583 --> 35:24.333
-Look at that.
-RICK: That's a beauty.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.000
You know what that looks like?

35:26.208 --> 35:28.000
Remember over here?

35:28.208 --> 35:30.500
-Yep. That...
-That's what that looks like.

35:30.583 --> 35:33.667
NARRATOR:
It was less than 30 yards
from this location

35:33.833 --> 35:35.083
where one year ago...

35:35.250 --> 35:38.333
GARY:
(exclaims) Look at that!

35:38.500 --> 35:41.500
-It's a coin, mate. That is old.
-(laughs)

35:41.708 --> 35:43.750
NARRATOR:
Just days after the team
purchased the lot

35:43.917 --> 35:47.625
from the estate of Robert Young,
Rick and Gary discovered

35:47.792 --> 35:50.833
the nearly 2,000-year-old
half Roman coin.

35:50.958 --> 35:54.667
Is it possible that they have
just found another coin

35:54.875 --> 35:56.625
of the same origin?

35:56.792 --> 36:00.708
If so, how did they end up
on Oak Island?

36:00.833 --> 36:03.167
And what could it mean
for Lot 5's significance

36:03.375 --> 36:07.708
as it relates to the
228-year-old treasure mystery?

36:07.875 --> 36:09.583
Doesn't that give you
that hand-hammered look?

36:09.750 --> 36:13.500
Yeah, it's got
that same vibe about it.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.375
That looks like an head,
doesn't it, Rick?

36:15.542 --> 36:17.792
RICK:
You can see it, right there.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.708
I see that hand-hammered look,

36:21.917 --> 36:23.375
like the half Roman coin.

36:23.542 --> 36:25.333
We have to bring it
back to the lab,

36:25.500 --> 36:28.583
we have to have Emma
do the XRF and the CT scan,

36:28.750 --> 36:30.292
hopefully, there's something
on the coin.

36:30.417 --> 36:32.000
But it was a heck of a find.

36:32.167 --> 36:34.167
That's a top pocketer there.

36:34.375 --> 36:36.250
Imagine the look on their faces

36:36.417 --> 36:38.792
-when we take that
into the-the lab.
-(laughs)

36:38.958 --> 36:40.708
Part of me would like
to go back to the lab,

36:40.875 --> 36:41.958
but I don't think we should.

36:42.125 --> 36:43.333
-We should just keep going.
-Yeah.

36:43.542 --> 36:44.708
Keep going, mate.
We've got other flags.

36:44.875 --> 36:47.750
Fantastic.
That's going in the bag, mate.

36:47.917 --> 36:50.833
RICK:
Lot 5 has presented all kinds
of unique opportunities

36:51.000 --> 36:52.667
for metal detecting.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.167
-Next target's over there.
-Okey doke.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.708
RICK:
There have been
a number of finds.

36:56.875 --> 37:00.750
And so, the future of Lot 5
looks exceedingly bright.

37:00.958 --> 37:02.875
Hopefully there's more.

37:03.042 --> 37:04.750
GARY:
Next flag, coming up.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.875
(device beeping)

37:09.042 --> 37:10.333
Okay.

37:12.042 --> 37:13.875
Another sharp signal.

37:20.458 --> 37:22.083
RICK:
Let's see where it is.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.125
Let's see what we've got.

37:25.333 --> 37:27.750
-(high-pitched beeping)
-RICK: It'd be amazing
if it were another one.

37:29.583 --> 37:31.583
-It's in your hand.
-It's in my hand.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.500
(rapid beeping)

37:34.875 --> 37:36.833
Let's see what we got, Rick.

37:37.042 --> 37:38.500
Big reveal.

37:40.833 --> 37:42.875
-Ooh-hoo!
We got another coin, mate!
-(laughs)

37:43.042 --> 37:44.667
Hey!

37:44.833 --> 37:46.875
That is fantastic.

37:47.042 --> 37:49.667
-Look at that. (whoops)
-I thought I saw something.

37:49.833 --> 37:52.208
-GARY: That's a coin.
-And another hand-hammered one.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.500
GARY:
Yeah.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.333
You know what?
I think at this point,

37:56.542 --> 37:59.083
we need to call my brother
and we need to call Craig

37:59.250 --> 38:00.417
and see if they want
to come down.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.333
I can't imagine they'll say no.

38:02.542 --> 38:04.417
-Yeah.
-All right, I'm gonna
call them right now,

38:04.542 --> 38:06.792
-see if they want to come down.
-(line ringing)

38:08.208 --> 38:10.125
-MARTY (over phone): Hello?
-Hey.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.167
-It's Rick.
-We're on lot... we're on Lot 5.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.250
-Yeah?
-And I think you and Craig
want to come down here,

38:15.417 --> 38:18.208
and I am not gonna tell you
the reason why.

38:18.375 --> 38:19.667
Okay. I'm on my way.

38:19.875 --> 38:21.208
-On my way.
-All right. See you both.

38:21.375 --> 38:22.708
All right, take care.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.208
Big Brother Rick
calls me out of the blue

38:25.375 --> 38:27.458
and tells me I better
come see something, I'm excited.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.208
He won't do that
for just anything,

38:29.375 --> 38:31.083
so this is gonna be
something good.

38:31.208 --> 38:33.167
All right, all right.

38:33.292 --> 38:35.333
You teased us enough.
What do you got?

38:35.542 --> 38:36.542
We're not gonna say anything.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.208
-GARY: No.
-But what I want is

38:38.375 --> 38:39.833
your first impressions.

38:40.042 --> 38:41.708
GARY:
Here we go.
Hold your hand out, Marty.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.792
There's your little reward
from Lot 5.

38:45.958 --> 38:48.500
RICK:
What's your first impression?

38:48.625 --> 38:51.500
MARTY:
I don't know.
It's a very old coin.

38:51.667 --> 38:53.833
Doesn't remind you of anything?

38:54.000 --> 38:56.625
Maybe the Roman one, I guess.
I don't know.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.333
Wait.
There's insignia on this.

38:59.542 --> 39:01.458
There's some sort of cross
or something on that.

39:03.917 --> 39:06.083
RICK:
There's three loops of chain.

39:06.250 --> 39:08.292
-See that?
-MARTY: Oh, yes. I do.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.250
This coin is gonna
tell us something.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.583
What do you got
in your other hand?

39:11.792 --> 39:14.208
Uh, this is
a little prezzy for Craig.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.292
RICK:
See-see the hand-hammered look?

39:16.458 --> 39:18.000
CRAIG:
Yeah.

39:18.167 --> 39:20.208
What-what's this...
what's this all about, Gary?

39:20.375 --> 39:22.667
I have no idea, mate.
I'm gobsmacked.

39:22.792 --> 39:24.292
MARTY:
Were they found together?

39:24.500 --> 39:25.917
GARY:
Not too far away.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.292
I don't know what the hell
to make of this,

39:27.458 --> 39:28.958
but I sure am intrigued with it.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.667
What it's saying is
there is a real mystery here

39:31.833 --> 39:34.167
and there is a real story here,

39:34.375 --> 39:36.208
-and we will uncover it.
-CRAIG: It... Yeah.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.708
-Pretty cool, guys.
-GARY: Yep.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.708
We have a couple more.
Why don't you dig one?

39:39.875 --> 39:41.417
-You pick one and you pick one.
-Craig, you dig one.

39:41.542 --> 39:43.250
-Yeah.
-No, mine will be a,
mine will be

39:43.417 --> 39:45.250
-a .22 shell.
-Oh, pick one. Come on.

39:45.375 --> 39:47.500
-GARY: Let's go
dig another one up.
-MARTY: That one.

39:49.458 --> 39:50.625
MARTY:
My turn to dig.

39:50.833 --> 39:53.417
My track record is poor, but...

39:53.583 --> 39:55.875
from the human heart,
hope springs eternal.

39:56.042 --> 39:58.000
Maybe this is mine.

39:58.167 --> 39:59.750
-(device beeping)
-Yeah.

40:02.708 --> 40:04.375
That sounds terrible.

40:06.292 --> 40:07.667
Yeah, it's nothing.

40:07.833 --> 40:09.792
I didn't even get anything.

40:09.958 --> 40:12.333
Let's move on.
That ain't nothing.

40:12.542 --> 40:14.167
Here you go, Craig.
(laughs)

40:14.333 --> 40:17.000
-You got me beat.
-Let's give it back
to the expert.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.667
Show us how it's done.

40:20.542 --> 40:23.250
MARTY:
Then it's Rick's turn again.

40:23.375 --> 40:25.500
Honestly, Rick seems
to find the good stuff.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.292
Jack. Jack and Rick
seem to find the good stuff.

40:28.417 --> 40:30.417
(device beeping)

40:30.583 --> 40:32.542
-There we are.
-Is that it?

40:34.500 --> 40:36.667
-Yes! A coin.
-(laughter)

40:36.875 --> 40:38.458
(whoops)

40:38.667 --> 40:39.833
MARTY:
So, what's the score
at this point?

40:39.958 --> 40:41.417
Not that we should be
keeping score,

40:41.542 --> 40:43.708
but I believe it's, uh,
Big Brother Rick: 3,

40:43.875 --> 40:45.625
Craig and Marty combined: 0.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.167
-GARY: Look at that.
-(laughter)

40:47.375 --> 40:48.833
-CRAIG: You know how to do it.
-Come on.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.167
What the hell?

40:51.375 --> 40:53.167
GARY:
Fantastic.

40:53.333 --> 40:54.667
MARTY:
I think this is a record.

40:54.833 --> 40:56.667
Three coins in one morning,

40:56.792 --> 40:59.625
and all of them peculiar
and perhaps ancient.

40:59.792 --> 41:02.000
These are potentially
major-league finds.

41:02.167 --> 41:04.708
GARY:
Yeah, no,
it's got that same patina.

41:04.875 --> 41:06.542
RICK:
Yeah, that's the same thing.

41:06.708 --> 41:08.542
GARY:
That's got to be
a really old coin, mate.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.792
-RICK: It-it-- it's like
the other ones.
-Yeah.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.333
Pretty cool.

41:12.542 --> 41:14.292
-You're coming around to it.
-Well, I-I...

41:14.417 --> 41:16.250
I'm-I'm not ready to say
those are Roman.

41:16.375 --> 41:17.750
-Exactly.
-Yeah, but they're old coins,

41:17.917 --> 41:20.375
and they-- there's a story
going on here.

41:20.542 --> 41:22.375
I know we don't
understand this story yet.

41:22.583 --> 41:23.750
I know we don't understand

41:23.917 --> 41:26.375
the complexity
that the mystery is,

41:26.542 --> 41:29.833
but we know for certain
in our heart of hearts

41:30.000 --> 41:32.250
that there's something here
to this mystery.

41:32.458 --> 41:35.708
It has long endured. 228 years.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.500
-Let's go to the lab.
-Yep.

41:39.792 --> 41:42.625
GARY:
Lot 5 just keeps giving it.

41:51.167 --> 41:52.417
MARTY:
Laird.

41:52.583 --> 41:54.667
-Hey.
-We've got some stuff for you.

41:54.875 --> 41:56.625
NARRATOR: In the Oak Island
Interpretive Centre,

41:56.833 --> 41:58.750
Rick and Marty Lagina,

41:58.917 --> 42:00.833
their partner Craig Tester

42:01.042 --> 42:03.375
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

42:03.542 --> 42:05.458
meet with archaeologist
Laird Niven

42:05.625 --> 42:09.125
along with archaeometallurgist
Emma Culligan.

42:09.292 --> 42:10.500
-Lot 5.
-LAIRD: Yeah.

42:10.625 --> 42:12.708
Just up from
where the feature is.

42:12.875 --> 42:16.042
NARRATOR: They are eager
to have Laird and Emma analyze

42:16.208 --> 42:19.667
the discoveries that were made
earlier today on Lot 5:

42:19.833 --> 42:22.667
three potentially ancient coins.

42:23.625 --> 42:26.625
Uh, we'll let you
take a look at them

42:26.792 --> 42:29.500
and tell us what
you believe these are.

42:29.667 --> 42:31.542
Cool stuff, though.

42:39.042 --> 42:39.958
LAIRD:
Hmm.

42:42.958 --> 42:45.708
-It's an oldie, isn't it?
-GARY: It is, mate.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.125
Almost the same patina
as the Roman coin.

42:49.250 --> 42:50.833
-RICK: There you go.
-GARY: Yeah.
-LAIRD: Right.

42:50.958 --> 42:53.583
If you find one half-Roman coin,
which we did last year,

42:53.750 --> 42:55.000
okay,
that's one half-Roman coin.

42:55.208 --> 42:59.167
It's still amazing.
But three coins?

42:59.375 --> 43:02.333
They're clearly very old.
They're patinaed.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.708
I want to believe
that they're hugely significant.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.625
What do these things mean

43:07.792 --> 43:09.708
with regard to what happened
on Oak Island?

43:09.875 --> 43:12.500
-What, should she do an XRF?
-Yeah.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.875
-CRAIG: Get a scan going?
-LAIRD: I think so.

43:15.042 --> 43:17.875
Emma, we want to know
exactly what this is,

43:18.042 --> 43:20.083
when it was made,
and who dropped it, okay?

43:20.208 --> 43:21.417
No pressure.

43:21.583 --> 43:22.875
-And when.
-(chuckles)

43:23.042 --> 43:24.792
NARRATOR:
In order to help determine

43:24.958 --> 43:27.250
the possible origin
of the coins,

43:27.375 --> 43:28.833
Emma will scan them

43:29.042 --> 43:31.333
using an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer--

43:31.542 --> 43:35.792
a device that bombards objects
with non-destructive radiation

43:35.917 --> 43:38.208
to identify
the elements and minerals

43:38.375 --> 43:40.250
that make up their composition.

43:42.250 --> 43:44.500
EMMA: So, the XRF is done
for the first coin.

43:44.667 --> 43:47.875
It's 94% copper
with about five percent silver.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.750
-Copper and silver?
-EMMA: Yeah.

43:49.917 --> 43:52.750
Normally, Roman coins have
tin and lead,

43:52.917 --> 43:54.417
which I'm not seeing
in this one.

43:54.583 --> 43:57.458
So, not Roman,
but it's not modern, either,

43:57.625 --> 44:00.875
'cause it has
no modern coin alloys.

44:01.042 --> 44:03.625
-CRAIG: Okay. Want to look
at another one?
-Yeah.

44:04.625 --> 44:06.333
RICK:
Which one is this one,
the big one?

44:06.500 --> 44:08.333
MARTY:
The itty-bitty one.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.500
Ooh, that's a different metal.

44:10.667 --> 44:13.667
-MARTY: It is?
-LAIRD: It sure looks like it.

44:13.875 --> 44:15.250
It seems,
it's a different color.

44:15.417 --> 44:18.583
It's more brassy, bronzy.

44:18.750 --> 44:22.792
Here, check that out.
Now tell me what you see, mate.

44:23.792 --> 44:25.833
LAIRD:
I see the stuff in the center.

44:26.042 --> 44:28.875
MARTY:
It looks like a female.

44:29.042 --> 44:31.208
GARY:
Definitely looks
like a face, doesn't it?

44:31.375 --> 44:34.417
-Let's have her run that one.
-MARTY: Yeah.

44:34.583 --> 44:36.833
-Can we run this one
in the XRF, please?
-EMMA: Yes.

44:39.708 --> 44:41.458
RICK:
Finding these coins

44:41.542 --> 44:44.833
from roughly
a very localized area,

44:44.958 --> 44:46.500
that's certainly intriguing.

44:46.708 --> 44:48.167
Why here?

44:48.333 --> 44:50.833
We're really gonna have
to put our heads down

44:51.000 --> 44:52.125
and try to figure out
what it means.

44:52.292 --> 44:54.833
And maybe it will help us
as we move forward.

44:54.958 --> 44:58.917
So the second coin I scanned,

44:59.083 --> 45:03.292
we've got copper, silicon,
some lead, some tin.

45:03.417 --> 45:05.667
So I'd say yeah, pretty good
candidate for Roman coin.

45:05.875 --> 45:07.500
CRAIG:
She matched it

45:07.708 --> 45:10.042
to the Roman coins
in the database.

45:10.250 --> 45:12.833
So, what were
the coins doing here?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Who brought them here?

45:14.167 --> 45:15.250
Knights Templar, obviously,

45:15.375 --> 45:16.792
is one of the groups

45:17.000 --> 45:18.167
that jump into your mind.

45:18.333 --> 45:20.917
Well, that... that one's
looking promising.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.833
NARRATOR:
A second potentially
ancient Roman coin

45:24.042 --> 45:26.833
discovered on Lot 5?

45:27.042 --> 45:31.000
If so, were they brought
to Oak Island by the same people

45:31.208 --> 45:35.125
who may have hidden something
of great value in the Money Pit?

45:35.250 --> 45:36.667
In recent years,

45:36.833 --> 45:39.667
members of the team
have found clues

45:39.792 --> 45:41.292
possibly related
to the Oak Island mystery

45:41.458 --> 45:43.333
at locations across Europe--

45:43.500 --> 45:46.958
such as in Portugal,
England and Italy--

45:47.125 --> 45:49.542
that were once part
of the Roman Empire...

45:49.708 --> 45:51.250
What did you find, Pete?

45:51.417 --> 45:53.833
I think something
pretty interesting.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.167
It's the same as the H+O stone.

45:56.375 --> 46:00.125
NARRATOR:
...but later, between
the 12th and 16th centuries

46:00.292 --> 46:03.250
served as strongholds
for the Knights Templar--

46:03.375 --> 46:06.333
a Christian military order
that many believe

46:06.458 --> 46:08.167
hid a vast treasure

46:08.292 --> 46:11.833
along with priceless religious
artifacts on Oak Island,

46:12.000 --> 46:16.167
including the Holy Grail
and the Ark of the Covenant.

46:16.333 --> 46:18.167
ALEX:
You get the H+O Stone.

46:18.333 --> 46:20.625
And this symbol,
we've learned today,

46:20.792 --> 46:24.083
means Templar-related relic.

46:24.250 --> 46:27.417
And what have we found that
the symbol at the end means?

46:27.583 --> 46:29.083
Some have interpreted it
to be gold.

46:29.250 --> 46:30.750
ALEX:
Yeah.

46:30.875 --> 46:33.208
NARRATOR:
Last year, while investigating

46:33.375 --> 46:35.000
a medieval church
in Viterbo, Italy,

46:35.208 --> 46:37.625
Marty's son, Alex, speculated

46:37.750 --> 46:39.417
that a mysterious symbol
they found,

46:39.542 --> 46:43.500
which was also discovered
on Oak Island in the 1920s

46:43.667 --> 46:46.875
carved into a boulder
known as the H+O Stone,

46:47.042 --> 46:50.333
may very well have
a Templar connection.

46:50.917 --> 46:52.375
ALEX:
To put it all together, I mean,

46:52.542 --> 46:55.333
there is a possibility
that the H+O Stone represents

46:55.500 --> 46:58.083
"Here, Templar gold."

46:58.208 --> 47:00.167
And then you can look
at the last one.

47:00.333 --> 47:02.625
That's the one
with a lot of markings on it.

47:02.792 --> 47:03.958
CRAIG:
Yeah.

47:04.083 --> 47:04.792
LAIRD:
To me, it almost looks like

47:04.917 --> 47:06.708
a woven pattern.

47:06.875 --> 47:09.000
GARY:
Almost looks like
some chain links.

47:09.167 --> 47:11.667
Yeah. Why don't you
throw that one in?

47:11.750 --> 47:13.833
Emma, here's the last one.

47:13.958 --> 47:16.375
So right now, we have
one indeterminant coin--

47:16.542 --> 47:17.917
which is weird--

47:18.083 --> 47:21.750
95% copper, five percent silver,
which is very strange.

47:21.917 --> 47:25.917
We have one coin
that could be Roman

47:26.042 --> 47:27.958
based on the metallurgy.

47:28.958 --> 47:30.375
And then we have
a yet to be determined,

47:30.542 --> 47:32.542
while it's put in the XRF.

47:32.708 --> 47:35.417
GARY:
From metal detecting experience,

47:35.583 --> 47:38.667
some of these features that
you're looking at on these coins

47:38.875 --> 47:40.750
are ancient features.

47:40.917 --> 47:43.500
This one is the last one.

47:43.667 --> 47:44.958
CRAIG:
And which one
are we looking at now?

47:45.125 --> 47:46.208
MARTY:
Waffle coin.

47:46.375 --> 47:49.583
From first look,
I've got brass...

47:49.750 --> 47:53.750
...with iron, heavy manganese,

47:53.917 --> 47:56.542
especially
with a brass coin... Oh.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.667
No, that's not modern.

47:58.875 --> 47:59.833
Why? What is it?

48:00.000 --> 48:03.667
So it is technically a brass,

48:03.792 --> 48:06.083
but the high calcium
and phosphorous,

48:06.250 --> 48:09.000
I was looking
at where have I seen

48:09.125 --> 48:11.250
such across-the-board
composition.

48:11.375 --> 48:13.667
And that is the French denier.
I've scanned a French denier

48:13.875 --> 48:15.875
-dated... 13th century?
-I think so.

48:16.042 --> 48:17.542
-Just like the cross.
-Wow.

48:19.375 --> 48:22.042
NARRATOR:
First minted during
the late 7th century

48:22.208 --> 48:25.958
to replace gold coins
that were in circulation,

48:26.042 --> 48:27.958
the French denier
was widely used

48:28.125 --> 48:31.375
from the Middle Ages
up to the 17th century.

48:31.542 --> 48:35.333
Is it possible that this coin
could be of French origin?

48:35.500 --> 48:36.708
And if so,

48:36.875 --> 48:40.167
could it be connected
to the French lead barter token

48:40.375 --> 48:44.083
also found on Lot 5
one year ago,

48:44.208 --> 48:47.667
a barter token that when
scientifically analyzed

48:47.792 --> 48:50.167
proved to be
a compositional match

48:50.333 --> 48:52.417
to the 14th-century lead cross

48:52.583 --> 48:57.167
that was found
at Smith's Cove back in 2017,

48:57.292 --> 49:01.458
and which is also believed to be
of possible Templar origin?

49:02.958 --> 49:04.542
All three oddballs.

49:04.750 --> 49:06.583
-Three unique coins.
-Yep.

49:06.750 --> 49:08.667
Yep. This makes it
better for me.

49:08.875 --> 49:10.083
I would rather have

49:10.208 --> 49:13.208
these coins come
from different areas.

49:13.417 --> 49:15.000
You know, it goes to trade.

49:15.167 --> 49:16.500
You're going around,

49:16.667 --> 49:18.708
you've got different coins
in your pocket

49:18.875 --> 49:19.917
from different countries.

49:20.083 --> 49:22.042
-I think this is great.
-Yep.

49:22.250 --> 49:24.667
Emma, go ahead and do
your more comprehensive scans

49:24.792 --> 49:26.125
and then let us know.

49:26.250 --> 49:27.417
And we will get a hold
of Sandy Campbell.

49:27.542 --> 49:28.875
-Yep.
-MARTY: And get him out here.

49:29.083 --> 49:31.583
And we will go out
and find some more stuff.

49:31.708 --> 49:33.167
-EMMA: All right. Have fun.
-MARTY: Talk to you soon.

49:33.375 --> 49:33.958
-CRAIG: See you.
-GARY: See you later.

49:34.125 --> 49:36.000
We will. Cheers.

49:40.625 --> 49:42.750
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

49:42.917 --> 49:44.083
-(thunder rumbles)
-ALEX: Hey, guys.

49:44.250 --> 49:45.958
NARRATOR:
...Alex Lagina joins

49:46.125 --> 49:48.333
other members of the team
in the Money Pit area

49:48.542 --> 49:51.417
as the strategic core-drilling
operation continues.

49:51.625 --> 49:52.833
So, where are we?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.333
We're right in the middle
of the Baby Blob.

49:54.500 --> 49:57.125
So, this is our
best guess right now

49:57.292 --> 49:59.333
as to the source
of the metals in the water?

49:59.542 --> 50:00.417
TERRY:
Exactly.

50:01.542 --> 50:03.667
NARRATOR: The current borehole
that is being drilled

50:03.833 --> 50:07.333
is known as E5N-9.5.

50:07.542 --> 50:11.083
It is located several feet west
of the Garden Shaft

50:11.250 --> 50:13.458
in the so-called Baby Blob

50:13.625 --> 50:16.333
where high-trace evidence
of precious metals

50:16.458 --> 50:21.500
have been detected between
80 and 120 feet underground.

50:21.667 --> 50:23.458
Okay, guys, this is it.

50:25.042 --> 50:27.250
-How you doing Mike,
we go to 99?
-98.

50:27.375 --> 50:31.208
-We picked up a rock around 97.
-Okay, very good. Thank you.

50:31.375 --> 50:33.708
Let's slice and dice,
see what we got.

50:38.250 --> 50:40.875
That is Mother Nature,
unfortunately.

50:41.042 --> 50:42.458
There's a boulder in it.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.667
Sadly, gentlemen,
this doesn't look good.

50:46.875 --> 50:47.958
-Marty.
-Hey, Marty.

50:48.125 --> 50:50.375
Hello, gentlemen.
It's a wet one.

50:50.542 --> 50:51.417
It is a wet one.

50:51.583 --> 50:53.375
Anyway, nothing so far, Marty.

50:53.542 --> 50:56.000
This is not looking good,
we're at target depth

50:56.208 --> 50:57.500
and we don't think
we see anything.

50:57.708 --> 50:59.833
Show me, show me
where we are, please.

51:00.042 --> 51:01.208
Steve's got a map there for you.

51:01.375 --> 51:02.833
Okay. So we're right here.

51:03.042 --> 51:04.167
You can see we are about

51:04.292 --> 51:06.417
32 feet west
of the Garden Shaft,

51:06.583 --> 51:08.583
and we are about
seven or eight feet

51:08.750 --> 51:12.000
northwest of our tunnel
from where we hit last year.

51:12.167 --> 51:14.000
Somebody got a pencil?

51:14.167 --> 51:15.417
TERRY:
There's one right there.

51:16.542 --> 51:17.583
Okay.

51:17.750 --> 51:19.458
This is
the most interesting well.

51:19.625 --> 51:21.458
STEVE:
That's our eight-foot void
or tunnel.

51:21.625 --> 51:23.542
This one right here,
which is what number?

51:24.708 --> 51:26.500
That is DN-11.5.

51:27.750 --> 51:29.375
NARRATOR:
One year ago,

51:29.542 --> 51:32.792
while drilling borehole DN-11.5,

51:32.958 --> 51:36.000
some 12 feet southeast
from their current position

51:36.208 --> 51:40.042
at a depth
of approximately 90 feet

51:40.208 --> 51:43.167
the team encountered
an eight-foot-high void--

51:43.292 --> 51:44.792
or possible chamber--

51:44.958 --> 51:49.125
located just 20 feet west
of the Garden Shaft.

51:49.208 --> 51:50.792
-There's some wood, Terry.
-Whoa!

51:50.958 --> 51:52.667
-We've got wood
at the bottom here.
-Yeah.

51:52.833 --> 51:54.083
NARRATOR:
Incredibly, they also recovered

51:54.250 --> 51:55.750
a wood sample...

51:55.917 --> 51:57.792
TERRY:
Oh, my gosh.
We're into something.

51:57.917 --> 51:59.417
NARRATOR:
...that when analyzed
by Emma Culligan

51:59.542 --> 52:02.083
contained high-trace
evidence of gold.

52:02.208 --> 52:04.167
It shows gold.

52:04.375 --> 52:05.917
-Yeah. It's there.
-(chuckles)

52:06.875 --> 52:10.333
The scientists say
metals are coming out of here.

52:10.458 --> 52:12.833
The only thing
that could be producing metals

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
is out of some
man-made something.

52:15.208 --> 52:18.083
That's a big enough box
for an offset chamber.

52:19.125 --> 52:21.208
I just want to put another one
right down, right down into it.

52:21.375 --> 52:23.333
Marty, I'm with you,
if we go back

52:23.542 --> 52:26.167
to DN-11.5, we should put
another well right next to it.

52:26.292 --> 52:28.625
-Yep.
-And try to get back into this,

52:28.792 --> 52:30.083
whatever it is,
tunnel or chamber.

52:30.208 --> 52:31.458
Agreed.

52:31.667 --> 52:32.958
Let me talk
to everybody else and see.

52:33.125 --> 52:34.208
I'm gonna take off right now.

52:34.375 --> 52:35.833
Finish this one up,
we'll get you some info.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.500
-Thanks, guys.
-Okay.
-MARTY: See you, guys.

52:43.833 --> 52:46.333

52:47.917 --> 52:49.250
TERRY:
Gentlemen, here we go.

-STEVE: How're you doing?
-TERRY: Alex, how're you doing?

52:52.792 --> 52:53.833
Good.

52:54.042 --> 52:55.167
So, just getting started?

52:55.333 --> 52:56.708
Just queueing her up.

52:56.875 --> 52:59.042
NARRATOR:
In spite of an ominous storm

52:59.208 --> 53:01.000
that has enveloped Oak Island,

53:01.208 --> 53:04.167
another hopeful morning has
begun in the Money Pit area

53:04.333 --> 53:05.750
for Alex Lagina

53:05.958 --> 53:08.542
and other members of the team.

53:08.750 --> 53:11.000
-Where are we?
-DN-12. I've got a map.

53:11.208 --> 53:12.875
-ALEX: Cool.
-TERRY: The man's got a map.

53:13.042 --> 53:15.250
NARRATOR:
At the direction
of Alex's father Marty,

53:15.417 --> 53:17.833
the team has just broken ground

53:18.042 --> 53:20.458
on a borehole known as DN-12--

53:20.667 --> 53:24.833
a borehole located within
the so-called Baby Blob,

53:25.000 --> 53:26.750
or possible treasure zone,

53:26.875 --> 53:31.875
that sets less than three feet
east of borehole DN-11.5.

53:32.042 --> 53:36.208
It was there that a mysterious
eight-foot void was discovered

53:36.375 --> 53:39.542
one year ago
at a depth of some 90 feet

53:39.708 --> 53:43.583
containing high-trace
evidence of gold.

53:44.625 --> 53:46.208
STEVE:
Based on all the information
we've had so far,

53:46.375 --> 53:49.542
DN-12 is still our best target
to hope to get back

53:49.750 --> 53:50.833
into that eight-foot chamber.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.708
Right. And I'm with my dad.

53:52.875 --> 53:54.542
I mean, he-he really feels
that, you know,

53:54.750 --> 53:57.542
this is probably our best chance
to hit something meaningful

53:57.750 --> 54:01.542
and with that eight-foot span
that we hit in a previous hole,

54:01.708 --> 54:03.292
we could have found
an offset chamber.

54:03.500 --> 54:04.708
Absolutely.

54:06.458 --> 54:09.458
MARTY:
The site itself
is interesting because

54:09.625 --> 54:12.000
I am a believer
in an offset chamber

54:12.167 --> 54:14.708
as a likely repository

54:14.875 --> 54:17.458
for any treasure
that might be here.

54:17.583 --> 54:19.167
The good news
about this location is

54:19.375 --> 54:20.667
it's close to the Garden Shaft.

54:20.875 --> 54:23.167
So it's well within the range
of where we can

54:23.375 --> 54:24.833
tunnel to from the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

54:25.042 --> 54:26.500
-Exactly.
-So...

54:26.667 --> 54:28.000
I'm gonna run for a little bit.

54:28.167 --> 54:29.667
I'll check back in later
if I can.

54:29.792 --> 54:31.083
-No problem.
-Let me know
if anything happens.

54:31.250 --> 54:32.333
TERRY:
Yeah, we'll be in touch.

54:32.542 --> 54:34.083
-CHARLES: Will do.
-ALEX: Thanks.

54:34.250 --> 54:35.333
NARRATOR:
As the core-drilling operation

54:35.500 --> 54:37.583
continues
in the Money Pit area...

54:38.875 --> 54:41.500
MARTY: Guys, you know we're
waiting on our swamp permit.

54:41.708 --> 54:43.667
NARRATOR:
...Alex joins his father Marty

54:43.875 --> 54:45.500
and his uncle Rick

54:45.708 --> 54:47.458
along with other members
of the team

54:47.625 --> 54:49.250
in the research center.

54:49.458 --> 54:52.083
I talked to Tony.
He's available this year.

54:52.250 --> 54:54.208
I thought we'd talk
about dive targets.

54:54.417 --> 54:57.208
Yeah. Yeah,
the north end of the bog

54:57.375 --> 54:59.458
has drawn Tom's curiosity

54:59.542 --> 55:00.875
as it has every year.

55:01.083 --> 55:02.792
Well, we intend to,
as part of our permit,

55:03.000 --> 55:05.167
we intend to do
a dig there, but...

55:05.333 --> 55:07.667
if there is this artificial wall

55:07.875 --> 55:10.333
that Fred spoke of
quite earnestly,

55:10.458 --> 55:14.000
then there had to be
some evidence of

55:14.167 --> 55:16.792
some of that work offshore.

55:19.208 --> 55:21.167
GARY:
Big old log on there.

55:21.333 --> 55:23.375
And we got a plank here as well.

55:23.583 --> 55:24.958
NARRATOR:
One year ago,

55:25.125 --> 55:27.625
fellow Oak Island landowner
Tom Nolan,

55:27.792 --> 55:30.500
along with Rick
and members of the team,

55:30.667 --> 55:33.833
unearthed evidence
of a mysterious wooden structure

55:34.000 --> 55:36.875
just north of
the triangle-shaped swamp.

55:38.292 --> 55:39.542
GARY:
Wow. Look at this.

55:39.708 --> 55:42.667
That could be like
an old iron pin.

55:43.667 --> 55:45.083
RICK:
I'd say it is.

55:46.708 --> 55:48.500
NARRATOR:
They were investigating
a long-held theory

55:48.708 --> 55:50.833
of Tom's late father Fred Nolan

55:51.042 --> 55:53.333
that the swamp was
artificially created

55:53.542 --> 55:56.250
centuries ago
by the installation of dams

55:56.375 --> 55:59.583
on the northern and southern
boundaries of the island.

56:00.625 --> 56:03.500
Incredibly, Fred's theory
was also corroborated

56:03.708 --> 56:06.833
by a reported 14th century
map of Oak Island

56:06.958 --> 56:09.792
that was given
to the team in 2016

56:09.958 --> 56:12.750
by the late researcher
Zena Halpern--

56:12.875 --> 56:15.708
a map which Zena believed
had been created

56:15.875 --> 56:18.167
by members
of the Knights Templar

56:18.375 --> 56:20.458
and featured numerous landmarks

56:20.583 --> 56:23.208
including one in the northern
region of the island

56:23.375 --> 56:25.583
labeled as The Dam.

56:26.625 --> 56:29.292
As part of that exploration
on the north bog,

56:29.417 --> 56:31.000
we should have an understanding
of what's out in the water.

56:31.208 --> 56:32.667
ALEX:
Mm-hmm.

56:33.708 --> 56:35.667
NARRATOR:
While the team awaits
a permit to conduct

56:35.875 --> 56:39.250
a larger excavation
in search of the dam on land,

56:39.417 --> 56:42.917
they are hoping that the waters
just off the island might

56:43.083 --> 56:47.250
contain more clues to support
Fred Nolan's incredible theory.

56:48.458 --> 56:50.500
The thing that was
most curious about that,

56:50.667 --> 56:51.708
the northern end of the bog,

56:51.875 --> 56:54.542
is we did do a dig there
with Billy,

56:54.708 --> 56:56.167
and we found that spike.

56:56.292 --> 56:57.458
It was only about yay long.

56:57.625 --> 57:00.542
And Emma did her analysis of it

57:00.708 --> 57:02.833
and it's possibly very old.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.583
If Fred is right,

57:04.708 --> 57:07.167
there may be evidence
of this artificial wall

57:07.375 --> 57:08.500
or some other edifice out there

57:08.667 --> 57:09.833
that we are currently
unaware of.

57:09.958 --> 57:11.792
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.458
We should go out there
and do a dive,

57:14.625 --> 57:16.708
and maybe, we know that Tony's
very good, right?

57:16.917 --> 57:19.000
He takes a line
and he runs a grid.

57:19.167 --> 57:20.500
Why not do it?

57:20.708 --> 57:22.833
No, I think
you two guys should do it.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.042
You young guys go out there
and do it, and report back.

57:25.208 --> 57:26.958
And if there's something
really cool to see,

57:27.042 --> 57:29.083
-then maybe I'll suit up.
-ALEX: Okay.

57:30.708 --> 57:31.833
RICK:
Solving the mystery

57:32.042 --> 57:33.958
is all about
connecting the dots.

57:34.125 --> 57:35.417
Well, we certainly have

57:35.583 --> 57:37.833
some very interesting dots
at this point.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.958
We've found, at the very least,

57:41.125 --> 57:43.708
ancient-looking coins.

57:43.875 --> 57:47.792
Is there something in the water
offshore of the swamp

57:47.958 --> 57:51.833
that's related to the finds
in Zena's map?

57:52.000 --> 57:53.375
It's possible.

57:53.542 --> 57:55.250
-See what you can see.
-Okay.

57:55.417 --> 57:56.708
We'll get in touch with Tony.

57:56.917 --> 57:58.417
-Okey doke.
-I want a full report.

57:58.542 --> 58:00.083
-ALEX: Okay.
-RICK: Good luck.

58:02.375 --> 58:04.417
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon,

58:04.542 --> 58:07.042
while the drilling
operation continues

58:07.208 --> 58:08.208
in the Money Pit area...

58:08.375 --> 58:10.542
TERRY:
Hey, Mike.

58:10.708 --> 58:13.000
-Thank you.
-28. 28.

58:13.875 --> 58:15.167
GARY:
All right.

58:15.292 --> 58:17.417
Let's add
to that ancient coin collection.

58:17.583 --> 58:19.250
Next target's here.

58:20.875 --> 58:22.542
NARRATOR:
...on Lot 5,

58:22.708 --> 58:25.000
located on the western side
of the island...

58:26.042 --> 58:27.292
GARY:
It's there, mate.

58:27.458 --> 58:29.917
Come on, Craig. One time.

58:30.125 --> 58:32.542
NARRATOR:
...Rick, Marty and Craig

58:32.708 --> 58:34.833
join Gary Drayton
to search for more clues

58:35.000 --> 58:38.167
near the area where three
ancient coins were discovered

58:38.375 --> 58:40.333
just two days ago.

58:41.542 --> 58:42.917
GARY:
He's going
full dung beetle on it.

58:43.083 --> 58:44.417
-(laughs)
-MARTY: Geez, look at him.

58:44.583 --> 58:46.458
RICK:
Keep looking, Craig.

58:46.625 --> 58:48.167
-You might find it, yourself.
-Yeah.

58:52.625 --> 58:53.583
CRAIG:
There it is.

58:53.750 --> 58:54.542
GARY:
There it is, mate.

58:54.708 --> 58:56.667
-You got it?
-Yeah.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.875
GARY:
What have we just found?

59:00.292 --> 59:02.208
-MARTY: Iron?
-GARY: Yeah.

59:02.417 --> 59:03.750
It looks like a map of Ohio.

59:05.167 --> 59:07.167
CRAIG:
I haven't worked
with Gary very often

59:07.375 --> 59:08.917
but when I have,

59:09.042 --> 59:12.167
I've never had any luck finding
anything of importance.

59:13.125 --> 59:15.792
I'd have to go
with "modern" on that.

59:16.750 --> 59:18.000
CRAIG:
My record stands,

59:18.208 --> 59:21.208
zero good finds,
a whole bunch of junk.

59:21.375 --> 59:23.000
MARTY:
Good find, Craig.

59:23.167 --> 59:25.792
-Yeah.
-GARY: I'm gonna
keep that in the pouch.

59:25.958 --> 59:28.583
And the next flag is over there.

59:28.792 --> 59:30.000
MARTY:
Treasure bound.

59:30.208 --> 59:31.208
Yep.

59:32.667 --> 59:33.917
All right.

59:36.708 --> 59:38.208
In the valley.

59:40.208 --> 59:42.333
(detector beeping)

59:42.500 --> 59:43.792
It's good.

59:44.708 --> 59:46.208
Right there, mate.

59:47.875 --> 59:49.958
That's a good sounding target.

59:53.667 --> 59:56.500
I'm gonna have to pry him
out of there.

59:56.708 --> 59:58.458
All right, Gary. Try that.

59:58.583 --> 01:00:00.708
Let's see what we've got.

01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:05.708
It's underneath this pile.

01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:14.500
We've got another one!

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.250
Look at that.

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:22.125
-(beeping)
-GARY: We've got another one!

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.333
That's a coin. Look!

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:24.833
It is a coin. All right!

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:27.625
-Another coin.
-GARY: Look at that.

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:29.167
NARRATOR:
On Lot 5,

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.583
located west of the swamp
on Oak Island...

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.833
GARY:
Wow. Look at that.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.833
NARRATOR:
...Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:37.833
along with Craig Tester

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:40.042
and Gary Drayton, have just made

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:43.458
another potentially
important discovery.

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:45.333
Is it the same
as the other ones?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.625
MARTY:
I don't see anything on it,
but it's about the same size.

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:49.875
GARY:
Anything on the other side?

01:00:52.667 --> 01:00:53.750
Thank you.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.458
I don't see anything, Gary.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:56.833
Oh, wait.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.000
Is that a number?

01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:00.708
There's some kind
of number or something.

01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:03.042
If you can see stuff
with a naked eye on it,

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.250
-then there should be
some details.
-I think, I think I can.

01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.375
Let's have a look.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.458
Yeah. Look at that.

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.667
Some kind of
like squiggly design.

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:13.583
That is just like
those other ones.

01:01:13.708 --> 01:01:16.500
-MARTY: Yeah.
-These are old.

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:18.333
That's brilliant, mate.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.375
MARTY:
I'm flabbergasted.

01:01:20.542 --> 01:01:22.000
We have a half a Roman coin

01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:25.250
verified by experts.

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:27.333
We have four new coins.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:32.083
That's five coins found on this
Lot 5 that are all inexplicable.

01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:34.125
So, we're gonna get
Sandy Campbell.

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:37.333
He's been out here before.
He's a numismatic expert

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:41.042
and he is gonna tell us
all about these coins.

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:43.125
You can see
by the patina, I mean,

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.083
that's been
in circulation a while.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.958
And, basically,
it's just change.

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:49.125
It's in awfully good shape.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.667
GARY:
Yeah.

01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:51.917
-What a day on Lot 5.
-MARTY: Oh, yeah.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.250
-Bag it and tag it.
-GARY: Yep.

01:01:53.417 --> 01:01:54.542
-Call it a day.
-GARY: Put it in the bag.

01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:58.125
Wow.

01:01:59.792 --> 01:02:02.417
-Smell that ancientness.
-(laughs)

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:03.833
GARY:
That's unbelievable.

01:02:04.042 --> 01:02:05.833
RICK:
It's been a really good day.

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:09.208
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:11.875
Okay, guys.
Here we are.

01:02:12.042 --> 01:02:14.417
-I'm quite excited
to get down there.
-Right.

01:02:14.542 --> 01:02:18.208
NARRATOR: ...in the waters
just north of Oak Island

01:02:18.375 --> 01:02:19.792
Alex Lagina

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.208
and Jack Begley
join diver Tony Sampson

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:25.250
and underwater
imaging expert Ken Deboer

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:27.875
to search for clues
that might be related

01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:29.792
to a possible buried dam

01:02:29.917 --> 01:02:32.542
near the northern region
of the swamp.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:35.542
So we're seven to eight feet
in the shallows, here.

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:36.625
ALEX:
Okay.

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.500
And we dropped down to about

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:39.667
-25 out here.
-ALEX: Right.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.417
So that's shallow enough

01:02:41.542 --> 01:02:44.000
that if we're looking
well in the past,

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:45.375
the water level
would've been lower.

01:02:45.542 --> 01:02:47.167
So it's, it's plausible that,

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:49.333
you know, something here
may have been on dry land

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.792
-at one point.
-Yeah.

01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:51.917
'Cause Fred Nolan thought
he had seen evidence

01:02:52.042 --> 01:02:53.750
of a structure
on his beach here.

01:02:53.958 --> 01:02:56.167
The one that correlates
with Zena Halpern's map.

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:57.333
Yeah. Exactly.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.250
And you guys were
looking for the dam.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:00.250
ALEX:
Exactly.

01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:02.208
So it is possible
that any evidence

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.833
of that structure might be
out here in the water.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.042
Yeah. Awesome. Okay.

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:08.750
I can't wait to
get on the bottom

01:03:08.917 --> 01:03:10.875
and get my eyes on it.
Your eyes will be on it

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.333
-with the ROV up here.
-JACK: Great.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.792
So we need to get
the ROV in the water,

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.000
and I'm gonna get suited up
and go get wet.

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:19.250
-Let's get started.
-Beautiful.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:23.458
All right. Here we go.

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:26.208
NARRATOR:
In order to further aid Tony
while he investigates

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:28.167
the possible man-made
feature underwater...

01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:31.917
KEN:
In she goes. Perfect.

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:33.500
NARRATOR:
...Ken will utilize

01:03:33.667 --> 01:03:37.167
a tethered, remote-operated
vehicle or ROV.

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:41.125
Equipped with thrusters
and a high definition camera,

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:45.083
the ROV will act as a second
set of eyes for the team

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:47.167
to help direct Tony

01:03:47.292 --> 01:03:49.917
toward any additional
targets of interest.

01:03:51.792 --> 01:03:53.958
-ALEX: So, Ken,
we'll run a grid?
-We're going to run a grid.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:55.833
-Okay.
-Just go back and forth.

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:57.917
-We'll follow the diver as well.
-Mm-hmm.

01:03:58.042 --> 01:04:00.042
And we'll be
in communication with Tony

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.708
-the entire time.
-ALEX: Perfect.

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:03.667
Good luck, Tony.

01:04:10.667 --> 01:04:13.500
-All right. Tony's in the water.
-Tony's in the water.

01:04:13.667 --> 01:04:15.417
There you go.

01:04:15.583 --> 01:04:17.833
KEN:
All right.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.333
Ready to rock and roll.

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.000
Surface to diver,

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:32.625
let us know if you see
any signs of a structure

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:33.667
or anything else.

01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:34.958
Over.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.208
-KEN: He's got his head
into something now.
-ALEX: Yeah.

01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:50.625
He's fanning.

01:04:50.792 --> 01:04:53.292
Yeah. Fanning is what we can do.

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:55.583
Digging is what we cannot do.

01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:59.000
NARRATOR:
Although Tony is allowed
to scan the seafloor

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:01.167
with a handheld
metal detector,

01:05:01.375 --> 01:05:04.542
provincial regulations
prohibit him from removing

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.583
or disturbing artifacts.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.125
Can you tell if there's
any more buried there?

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:15.458
Over.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.792
NARRATOR:
However, if potential clues
or valuables

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.333
are identified,

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.042
the team can apply
for a special permit

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.208
to retrieve and further
investigate them.

01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:31.375
JACK:
Tony's getting a visual
on possibly hard-carved wood

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:34.792
which is actually a really
exciting find because...

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.292
we have evidence from Zena's map

01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:41.250
that there's a dam somewhere
along the edge of the water

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:44.167
and that could indicate
that people were around

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:47.792
that north edge of the swamp
doing something.

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.583
Copy. How big?

01:05:58.042 --> 01:05:59.708
ALEX:
Copy.

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:01.500
So that sounds like,
I don't know,

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:02.708
a little piece of plank.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:06.500
I don't know what to make of it.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:07.708
KEN:
Yeah.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.375
Copy.
Keep us posted. Over.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:19.125
-KEN: We're going shallower.
-ALEX: Yeah.

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:22.000
Tony's heading
towards a boulder there.

01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:23.833
You can see him.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:31.833
He's going right straight
for whatever that is.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.208
What's that?

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:37.333
He's getting right down into it.

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:38.625
ALEX:
Mm-hmm.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:51.542
We found a fair amount
of pottery recently

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.042
just from Lot 5.

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.875
-Maybe it's comparable.
-Right.

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:56.333
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:58.375
that the artifacts
Tony has found

01:06:58.542 --> 01:07:00.958
are related to some
of the discoveries made

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:05.042
in the last year within
the two stone features on Lot 5?

01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:07.708
Artifacts that may date back

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:11.000
to as early as the 17th century?

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.542
ALEX:
After we get this pottery,

01:07:12.708 --> 01:07:14.708
I'm thinking there's
two possibilities here--

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:17.625
One is that the rocks
have trapped this stuff here.

01:07:17.792 --> 01:07:20.708
And the other is
that it's sort of a deposit.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:23.250
There's got to be
a source for these things.

01:07:23.417 --> 01:07:25.333
Hey, Tony, we'd love to see

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.875
if there's any other artifacts
surrounding this boulder.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:29.333
Over.

01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:33.042
Those are some big boulders.

01:07:33.208 --> 01:07:34.417
KEN:
Yeah.

01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:37.417
(detector whirring)

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:43.958
JACK:
All right.

01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:45.250
-There you go.
-KEN: Wow.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.417
-JACK: All right.
-KEN: Wow.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:55.542
That's incredible, Tony.
That's awesome.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:58.042
NARRATOR:
After finding pottery

01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:00.292
and other artifacts
in the waters just north

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.667
of the Oak Island swamp...

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.042
Keep us posted. Over.

01:08:04.208 --> 01:08:05.750
NARRATOR:
...diver Tony Sampson

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:09.708
has identified
a potentially valuable clue.

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:26.542
NARRATOR:
A possible coin?

01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:29.292
Until the team
can present their evidence

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.542
to the provincial government
and hopefully obtain

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.250
a special permit
to remove and examine it,

01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:38.667
unfortunately, this potentially
valuable discovery

01:08:38.833 --> 01:08:41.583
will have to remain
on the ocean floor.

01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:47.333
Copy that, Tony.
We'll see you on the boat soon.

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:48.458
Over.

01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:49.583
All right.

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:51.000
I'd say that was
a successful dive.

01:08:51.208 --> 01:08:52.333
Very.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.667
TONY:
What makes these
artifacts interesting

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:57.000
is they're similar
to the artifacts

01:08:57.208 --> 01:08:58.208
that they're finding on land.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:00.292
So either they came in on a ship

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:02.083
or maybe it's part
of a shipwreck

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.750
that was blowing up onshore.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.333
Wow. That was cool.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.875
Or maybe, it was
from people that were

01:09:10.042 --> 01:09:11.417
on the island itself.

01:09:11.583 --> 01:09:14.042
All right, Tony.
That was pretty exciting.

01:09:14.208 --> 01:09:16.500
That was
a fantastic dive, buddy.

01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:18.000
What about
that metal detector hit?

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:19.958
-What was it?
-So that was a disc.

01:09:20.083 --> 01:09:22.167
Like a coin with a hole in it.

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.417
-No kidding.
-Yeah.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:24.333
Initially,

01:09:24.542 --> 01:09:26.333
I thought it was one of those

01:09:26.542 --> 01:09:28.083
Chinese-style coins.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.583
-Really?
-I'm not sure.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.583
-Or something like that?
-Something like that.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:34.958
Just right up on that hill
is where Gary and I found

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:36.667
an actual Chinese coin,

01:09:36.792 --> 01:09:39.917
and that dated back
to possibly BC.

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:43.792
-Ooh!
-Oh! No way.

01:09:43.958 --> 01:09:46.208
That's an old coin.

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:48.375
GARY: And it's got
that square hole in it, mate.

01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:50.750
NARRATOR:
In 2020,

01:09:50.958 --> 01:09:53.167
while searching between
the swamp and the Money Pit

01:09:53.375 --> 01:09:54.833
on Lot 15,

01:09:55.042 --> 01:09:57.250
Jack and Gary unearthed a coin

01:09:57.417 --> 01:09:59.750
that, according
to numismatist Sandy Campbell,

01:09:59.917 --> 01:10:04.833
is of Chinese origin
and more than 1,000 years old.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:08.292
Is it possible
that Tony Sampson has just found

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.125
the same type of coin
in the waters

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:12.958
just north
of the Oak Island swamp?

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.667
If so,

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:18.458
could it and other items
he has discovered today,

01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:21.417
actually be related
to an ancient dam feature

01:10:21.583 --> 01:10:23.458
that is believed
to have been constructed

01:10:23.583 --> 01:10:25.417
in order to help
create the swamp

01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:28.333
more than 700 years ago?

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.000
Well, I was excited before
about the pottery

01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:33.125
but, I mean, pipe stems
and maybe even

01:10:33.292 --> 01:10:35.000
-a coin or something.
-TONY: Yeah.

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:36.375
-Now I'm really excited.
-TONY: Yep.

01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:38.167
ALEX:
One thing I know it is for sure

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:40.792
is a concentration
of artifacts underwater.

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:42.458
It might be enough to get

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:44.167
some kind of a permit to do
further investigation here.

01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:45.458
-Right.
-ALEX: That's what I'm thinking.

01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:47.417
RICK:
They're great finds.

01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:49.833
I think the next step
would have to be

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.292
to get a proper permit

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.542
for actually retrieving
some of these items.

01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:57.500
We may be able to understand
why they're there

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:00.250
and if they are
connected to Fred's wall

01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:02.542
in the north end of the bog.

01:11:03.542 --> 01:11:05.833
This area needs
a lot more investigation.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.042
Yeah. Nice job, Tony.

01:11:07.208 --> 01:11:07.875
-Well done.
-TONY: Thanks, my friend.

01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:09.375
JACK:
Yeah.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.750
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:16.000
TERRY: This is it.
This is the run.

01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:18.042
88 to 98's gonna do it.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.500
ALEX:
This could be the one.

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:21.167
NARRATOR:
...in the Money Pit area,

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:23.333
Alex Lagina has joined
Craig Tester

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:26.458
and other members of the team

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:29.417
as the drilling operation
in borehole DN-12

01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:31.833
is approaching the depth
where they hope

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:34.292
to once again encounter
an eight-foot void

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.583
and, hopefully,
the legendary treasure.

01:11:37.708 --> 01:11:39.375
-How deep are we?
-88.

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:40.792
STEVE:
They're on something.

01:11:45.125 --> 01:11:46.750
There it is.

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:49.917
That's the bottom of the run.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.083
-What you got, Mike?
-MIKE: 101.

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:55.333
101, that's what I thought.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:56.917
Three feet under.
There you go.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.708
That looks fairly soft
there, Terry.

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:06.000
-TERRY: It's softish. Yeah.
-MARTY: The base of it though.

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:09.083
-Right? That's the bottom?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:10.042
CHARLES:
Here's the top.

01:12:10.208 --> 01:12:11.500
Thank you.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.417
All right. Bring her in.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:18.792
MARTY:
Is there wood there?

01:12:18.958 --> 01:12:20.667
CHARLES:
Feels like something there.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.583
CHARLES:
That's wood.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.042
-SCOTT: Bingo.
-ALEX: There's wood.

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:30.125
-STEVE: Oh, good.
-TERRY: Wood up here, too.

01:12:30.292 --> 01:12:31.917
CHARLES:
Yeah.

01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:33.417
TERRY:
It's a fairly
significant beam, yeah.

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:36.000
It's very close
to 97 and a half,

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:37.417
right about there.

01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:39.250
That's where we want to be
for this hole.

01:12:39.417 --> 01:12:40.833
TERRY:
Yep.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.292
I have a question,
is this our tunnel

01:12:43.417 --> 01:12:44.750
or is this, is this the chamber?

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:46.625
I don't know because
we can't see the top.

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:49.875
But I'd say there's
enough loose material,

01:12:50.042 --> 01:12:51.542
so it's a chamber.

01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:53.375
-Chamber?
-MARTY: I'd say.

01:12:53.542 --> 01:12:54.875
TERRY:
Yep.

01:12:56.458 --> 01:13:00.583
MARTY:
Lo and behold, we do hit wood
in DN-12 at about 97 feet,

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.208
which is very close to exactly
where we hit wood before

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:06.083
in the Baby Blob
that we interpreted to be

01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:07.750
a chamber or vault.

01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:11.333
We're clearly into a collapsed
chamber of some sort.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.125
So we hit what we wanted to hit.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.250
We'll want a bunch
of samples of this.

01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:17.417
We test the metals.

01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:20.625
If it tests high enough,
this is it.

01:13:20.792 --> 01:13:21.958
Yeah.

01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:23.500
Yay!

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:25.792
This is a success
from a technical standpoint.

01:13:25.958 --> 01:13:26.958
It worked.

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:27.958
TERRY:
No question.

01:13:28.125 --> 01:13:29.667
So let's see what it says.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:32.667
ALEX:
It's gonna tell us a lot,
one way or the other.

01:13:32.833 --> 01:13:35.667
NARRATOR:
Following the potentially
historic discovery

01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:37.875
in the Money Pit area...

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:40.208
MARTY:
Hey, Gary. Laird.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.000
-Marty.
-Hey, guys.

01:13:42.208 --> 01:13:43.667
-Hey, guys.
-We have Sandy Campbell
with us today.

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.833
Hey, Sandy.
How's it going?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.625
-Good.
-Lots of work for you.

01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:49.500
Yeah. That's what I hear.

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.500
NARRATOR:
Rick, Marty and Craig Tester

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:53.667
accompany numismatist

01:13:53.875 --> 01:13:55.792
Sandy Campbell to meet
with Gary Drayton

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.208
and Laird Niven
in the Interpretive Centre.

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:01.208
With Sandy's
40 years of experience

01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:04.375
analyzing rare
and ancient coins,

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:06.583
it is the team's hope
that he can determine

01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:09.333
the origin of
the four mysterious coins

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:12.417
discovered
earlier this week on Lot 5.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:15.833
We had a heck of a week
on Oak Island.

01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:17.792
-(Marty chuckles)
-Let's have a look.

01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:21.667
It's interesting.

01:14:31.542 --> 01:14:34.750
(mutters quietly)

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:40.250
This design goes back
to the 1500s, 16th century.

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:44.333
RICK:
Which cultures
are you referencing?

01:14:44.458 --> 01:14:46.333
SANDY:
British. This is Tudor period.

01:14:46.458 --> 01:14:48.500
It's very obvious

01:14:48.667 --> 01:14:50.417
that that's
a portcullis on there.

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:54.333
And it's used even today
on modern British coins.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:57.625
NARRATOR:
Between the 5th
and 15th centuries,

01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:59.625
heavy iron gates

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:02.667
known as portcullises
were used to protect castles

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.417
and fortifications

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:07.000
across Europe
from invading armies.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.917
Beginning
in the late 15th century,

01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:13.083
the portcullis was
incorporated into the design

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:17.083
of English coinage to symbolize
strength and resilience.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:21.500
Is it possible that this coin
is related to the other

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:24.583
English artifacts
recently found on Lot 5,

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:27.583
such as those
potentially connected

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.375
to Sir William Phips
who is believed by some

01:15:30.583 --> 01:15:33.958
to have buried a large cache
of silver in the Money Pit?

01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:39.667
SANDY:
That's a, you know,
Tudor monarch period item.

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:42.833
I'm gonna have to try
and do a little more research.

01:15:42.958 --> 01:15:44.500
Well, that wasn't
the only coin, mate.

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:46.792
We have been
roaming around on Lot 5

01:15:46.958 --> 01:15:49.000
and we've got another

01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:51.667
little bobby-dazzler
of a coin to show you, mate.

01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:53.417
You are leading
the witness, Counselor.

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:55.625
Oh. (laughs)

01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:07.083
That's pretty obvious.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.375
MARTY:
Okay.

01:16:08.542 --> 01:16:10.250
SANDY:
Well, this here you can see

01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:12.917
the pretty common design,

01:16:16.792 --> 01:16:18.083
SANDY:
That's pretty obvious.

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.083
NARRATOR:
In the Interpretive Centre...

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:22.333
SANDY:
Well, this here you can see

01:16:22.542 --> 01:16:25.208
the pretty common design,

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:27.042
a Roman coin.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.875
-(Marty laughs)
-Roman, baby!

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:30.667
-MARTY: Is it?
-I knew it.

01:16:30.833 --> 01:16:32.167
NARRATOR:
...numismatist Sandy Campbell

01:16:32.375 --> 01:16:35.125
has just confirmed
that the Oak Island team

01:16:35.292 --> 01:16:38.833
has found another
Roman coin on Lot 5.

01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:40.583
What is it?
You said it was obvious. What?

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.083
What does that mean?

01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:46.208
It's-it's a Roman coin
from probably...

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:49.167
...between 100 and 300 AD,

01:16:49.292 --> 01:16:51.458
-if I'm allowed to use AD.
-RICK: Wow.

01:16:51.625 --> 01:16:53.083
My new best friend.

01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:57.125
NARRATOR:
Over the past year

01:16:57.292 --> 01:17:00.167
this is the second coin
found on Lot 5

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:04.125
that has been verified to be
more than 1,000 years old

01:17:04.292 --> 01:17:06.208
and of Roman origin.

01:17:06.417 --> 01:17:10.292
The questions now are when
were they brought to Oak Island?

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.792
And who brought them here?

01:17:12.958 --> 01:17:14.792
MARTY:
Had somebody told me

01:17:14.958 --> 01:17:16.833
that we would find this here,
I would have said no.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.833
"No, we're not gonna find
Roman coins here."

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.542
No. No, but here we are
with number two.

01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:23.167
MARTY:
Right.

01:17:23.333 --> 01:17:26.458
But you are quite definitive
about 100 to 300 AD?

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:27.625
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:27.792 --> 01:17:29.708
Well, this is all great, mate.

01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:32.542
But we got some more
candy for Sandy, mate.

01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:34.292
We got more coins.

01:17:34.458 --> 01:17:37.083
Sandy, I have the honor of being
the one who dug this coin up.

01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:40.833
Of course, Gary found it
and that is unique because

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.750
I never find anything.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:47.333
SANDY:
Well, it's... it's interesting.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.708
I'm seeing things
that appear to be design.

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:54.292
But nothing that's giving me

01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:56.417
feedback where I can identify.

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:57.958
What could that be?

01:17:58.125 --> 01:18:00.667
-It could be Indian.
-MARTY: Indian like India?

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.167
India. Yeah.
You know, like

01:18:02.333 --> 01:18:05.000
6th, 7th, 8th century
type thing.

01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:07.833
-Sheesh.
-That's a box
we haven't ticked off yet.

01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:10.167
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:13.708
MARTY:
We've found English coins.
We've found Spanish coins.

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:17.917
Now, we've found an Indian coin.
We've found a Chinese coin.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:23.333
Who gathers all these
weird non-associated coins?

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.000
I'm just trying to make sense

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:29.042
out of something that doesn't
appear to make sense.

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:32.833
We've got another
little coin to show you.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.167
-I hope that one's
just as interesting.
-Yep.

01:18:35.375 --> 01:18:36.458
Very tiny.

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:42.750
Like, the detail for this type
of coin is quite pronounced.

01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:44.000
-It is?
-SANDY: Yeah.

01:18:44.167 --> 01:18:46.958
This is a clearly Roman design.

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:49.250
So, it is a Roman coin?

01:18:49.417 --> 01:18:50.833
Absolutely, yeah.

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:54.000
-Two for two.
-Brilliant.

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:55.625
Remember when we were
out there, high-fiving?

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.875
-Yeah. Yeah.
-RICK: Now we know why.

01:18:58.042 --> 01:18:59.208
What do you see on there?

01:18:59.375 --> 01:19:02.250
I-I think this is
a male portrait.

01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:06.917
You got more of a pointed chin,
bigger nose.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:09.167
And then on the, on the reverse,

01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:12.542
you got two, two conjoined
people here, I think.

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:15.167
You know, this is probably,

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:16.667
you know, BC.

01:19:16.792 --> 01:19:18.833
Holy smokes.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.667
Is this 100%, Sandy?

01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:22.500
It's 100%.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:25.250
Absolutely incredible.

01:19:25.417 --> 01:19:28.292
So this could be the oldest coin
ever found on Oak Island.

01:19:28.458 --> 01:19:32.167
To unearth this
is pretty remarkable.

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:36.250
You know, the design
is very pronounced on a coin

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:39.000
that's more than 2,000
years old.

01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:40.417
MARTY:
The puzzlement grows.

01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:43.167
Three Roman coins
found on Oak Island.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:46.167
It's possible that
if there's an ancient treasure,

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:49.333
it would have
ancient things in it,

01:19:49.542 --> 01:19:52.458
including perhaps
a component of Roman coins.

01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:53.917
You have to keep an open mind

01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:56.542
because "facts,"
as Winston Churchill said,

01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:57.708
"are stubborn things."

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:59.042
Here's a fact--

01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:00.542
we found those coins
on Oak Island.

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:02.000
That's a fact.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.833
I've always believed
there was a plan

01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:08.542
properly executed over,

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:09.917
perhaps generationally,

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:11.667
perhaps over decades
or centuries.

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:14.000
It was that important.

01:20:14.167 --> 01:20:18.708
Look, I'm a big proponent
of Zena's research, right?

01:20:18.875 --> 01:20:20.208
That there was

01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:22.083
transatlantic voyages
to the New World

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:24.458
long before it's accepted.

01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.500
NARRATOR:
In 2016,

01:20:26.708 --> 01:20:28.250
when Zena Halpern gave the team

01:20:28.417 --> 01:20:31.125
a reported 14th century map
of Oak Island

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:33.042
that she believed
to have been created

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.208
by members
of the Knights Templar,

01:20:35.417 --> 01:20:38.500
she also shared
a second believed Templar map

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:42.500
of Nova Scotia dating back
to the 12th century.

01:20:42.708 --> 01:20:45.375
Since then, Rick, Marty

01:20:45.542 --> 01:20:47.000
and members of the team

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.542
have visited numerous
sites around Europe

01:20:49.708 --> 01:20:53.167
that served as strongholds
for the Knights Templar

01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:55.583
between the 12th
and 16th centuries...

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.250
Whoa.

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.375
NARRATOR:
...including in England...

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:04.917
Up there, on one of the bricks
is literally carved "1347."

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.375
NARRATOR:
...Portugal...

01:21:06.542 --> 01:21:09.208
It looks a lot more similar
to what we have.

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:10.792
-That's for sure.
-ALEX: Yeah.

01:21:10.917 --> 01:21:12.250
NARRATOR:
...and Italy

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:14.833
that were also once part
of the Roman Empire.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.042
We have seen this symbol before.

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:19.167
-RICK: H+O Stone.
-PETER: Yeah.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:21.125
-ALEX: Right there.
-RICK: It's perfect.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:22.875
NARRATOR:
And in each of these locations

01:21:23.042 --> 01:21:24.333
they have seen carvings

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.667
and structures similar to those

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:29.000
that have been found
on Oak Island.

01:21:29.208 --> 01:21:31.542
Could Rick Lagina be correct

01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:35.333
that the ancient Roman coins
unearthed on Lot 5

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:39.292
and the mysterious structures
found all around the island

01:21:39.417 --> 01:21:42.292
offer evidence
that Zena Halpern discovered

01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:45.667
the true origin of
the Oak Island mystery?

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:47.042
GARY:
What this tells me is

01:21:47.167 --> 01:21:49.167
there's a heck of a lot

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:51.000
of stories going on,
on this island,

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:54.917
from a long time ago.

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:57.958
I concur.
We've got to prove it.

01:21:58.125 --> 01:21:59.917
Let's be metal detectives.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.833
-GARY: Get back to Lot 5.
-Yeah. Metal detectives.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.625
Let's get going.

01:22:05.333 --> 01:22:08.625
NARRATOR:
A new year of searching
has just begun

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:11.792
for Rick, Marty and their team.

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:16.500
And already, they have made
discoveries on Oak Island

01:22:16.667 --> 01:22:20.333
and in the surrounding
waters that suggest

01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:24.333
this 228-year-old mystery
is more complex

01:22:24.458 --> 01:22:28.583
and profound than anyone
could have ever imagined.

01:22:29.875 --> 01:22:32.792
As the research, expert analysis

01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:36.417
and digging continues,
will they be able to shatter

01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:40.833
the protective barrier
of a deadly curse

01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:45.500
and finally recover a treasure

01:22:45.625 --> 01:22:50.042
that could rewrite
North American history?

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:53.042
This season on
The Curse of Oak Island...

01:22:53.208 --> 01:22:55.000
MARTY:
This is the year.

01:22:55.208 --> 01:22:56.958
There could be some actual
treasure just below us.

01:22:57.167 --> 01:22:58.375
RICK:
You have to follow the clues

01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.667
-where they lead.
-MARTY: Let's go!

01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:00.667
Let's go deep.

01:23:00.833 --> 01:23:02.125
We're very close

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:03.625
-to what we're trying to find.
-Right.

01:23:03.792 --> 01:23:06.167
We need to get to the bottom
of the Garden Shaft.

01:23:06.375 --> 01:23:08.083
ROGER: We pushed a hole and
there's a long void in there.

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:10.792
MARTY: It could be the offset
chamber that we seek.

01:23:10.958 --> 01:23:13.000
-TERRY: There it is, guys.
-Seven or eight-foot tunnel.

01:23:13.167 --> 01:23:14.583
This one is a mystery tunnel.

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:16.958
RICK: We found a structure
in the swamp.

01:23:17.042 --> 01:23:18.292
GARY:
Look at that!

01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:19.542
HELEN:
It's the first time in 40 years

01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:20.917
of fieldwork I've
seen something like this

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:22.667
buried.

01:23:22.833 --> 01:23:24.500
MARTY:
The results of the muon
technology are in.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:25.417
What we're seeing is

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:27.458
high-density anomaly 230 feet

01:23:27.625 --> 01:23:29.125
below the surface
of the Money Pit.

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.000
We think it's Aladdin's Cave.

01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:32.958
MATT L.:
There is wood in that void.

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:35.500
MARTY: It could be
a man-made structure.

01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:37.250
That makes the cave even
that much more important.

01:23:37.375 --> 01:23:38.292
MARTY: We are not
leaving this island

01:23:38.458 --> 01:23:39.417
without having a go

01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:40.875
at this Aladdin's Cave.

01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:42.250
I want to know what
this thing is.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.667
GARY: This year,
we could get down there

01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:46.042
and actually hold shiny
gold things in our hand.
