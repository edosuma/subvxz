00:28.795 --> 00:30.820
Let's take five, guys.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.163
Will, was that really necessary?

00:34.401 --> 00:37.427
I'm sorry, Carlton.
You thought I was laughing at you?

00:37.504 --> 00:38.766
That's what it sounded like.

00:38.838 --> 00:42.604
No. See, when I laugh at you,
it's more like this...

00:48.448 --> 00:50.507
Just for future reference.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.181
Man, y'all butchered that song.

00:53.253 --> 00:56.154
Hey, C, I'm telling you,
if the Commodores heard you singing...

00:56.222 --> 01:00.090
they'd tie you down to the tracks
and run you over with the soul train.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.626
I can understand why you're threatened.

01:05.698 --> 01:09.259
After all, you two possess
absolutely no musical ability.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.130
Face it, you're so jealous, you're green.

01:12.372 --> 01:15.967
All right, but just out of curiosity, Carlton,
what color are you?

01:18.578 --> 01:20.068
Here we go again.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.748
Just because I grew up
in the best neighborhoods...

01:22.816 --> 01:25.376
and pronounce the "i-n-g"s
at the end of my words...

01:25.452 --> 01:27.511
doesn't make me any less black than you.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.953
No. It's that tie that does it.

01:33.326 --> 01:36.921
Face it, C, I'm telling you.
If you went down to Jazz's neighborhood...

01:36.996 --> 01:39.931
Iooking the way you look
and talking the way you talk...

01:40.200 --> 01:43.101
you wouldn't come home
walking the way you walk.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.736
- And what neighborhood is that?
- Compton.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.306
And if you can make it there,
you'll make it anywhere.

01:50.009 --> 01:53.911
I'd do just fine and dandy in Compton,
thank you very much.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.872
You know, C, talk is cheap.
What do you say to a bet?

01:58.184 --> 01:59.242
Name it.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.753
I'll bet you
you wouldn't last a day in Compton.

02:01.821 --> 02:05.655
All right. And if I do, you have to stop
making those cheap shots at me.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.223
I don't know.
That's my whole reason for living.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.764
- Better make it two days.
- Two days? Piece of cake.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.960
And I guarantee, when I get to Compton,
I'll fit right in.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.568
Damn! Why didn't we bet money?

03:33.246 --> 03:34.304
Hello, everybody.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.940
It looks like the working girl is poised
for a promotion.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.005
What's up?

03:38.084 --> 03:42.418
I sold my first picture at the art gallery.
I think I'm going to get a raise.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.149
Excellent, Miss Hilary.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.692
You must let me know
what that feels like.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.766
If you wanna go to Compton,
you gotta go through with this.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.664
But I've never lied to my parents.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.761
It even gave me the willies
when Beaver used to do it.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.137
Fine. The bet's off, then.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.268
Man, it's about to be
Diss-fest '91 around here.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.177
And I feel one coming on now.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.546
All right, I'll do it.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.348
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Hi, guys.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.516
Hi, Mom.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.318
Dad, did you sign our permission slips yet?

04:23.463 --> 04:25.727
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.892
Two weeks ago, when Will and I gave you
a permission slip...

04:28.968 --> 04:30.697
for our field trip this weekend.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.261
You said you'd think about it
and sign it later.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.966
It doesn't ring a bell.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.309
Dad, you're always saying
how important these opportunities are.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.111
And when they come up,
you completely ignore them.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.577
It's like you don't even care.

04:51.891 --> 04:53.552
I remember.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.561
Where are you going, baby?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.121
Mr. Fellows is taking the class
to San Francisco...

05:00.199 --> 05:03.327
to visit Mark Twain's house,
and all the literary sites.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.871
I don't know. I thought it was important.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.237
Philip, how could you forget
something like that?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.437
I didn't forget, Vivian.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.370
Now, where did I put
those permission slips?

05:15.548 --> 05:17.277
Dad, don't bother looking.

05:17.850 --> 05:21.445
I found it in the trash can,
underneath a banana.

05:26.626 --> 05:30.062
Honestly, forgetting your son
and nephew like that...

05:31.698 --> 05:33.222
Here you are, guys.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.535
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thanks a lot, Uncle Phil.

05:37.236 --> 05:41.172
I mean, really, Philip, I think
you ought to review your priorities.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.935
I'm going straight to hell.

05:47.747 --> 05:51.148
Well, here we are, C. Jazz's crib.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.751
Crib: House, dwelling, domicile.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.315
How did you know that?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.622
Hip-hop flash cards?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.858
I made them myself.
I've been cramming all night.

06:07.934 --> 06:11.597
I just hope I can get it out of my head
before I take the SATs.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.371
- Yo, J.
- Prince.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.275
Hi, roomie.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.913
That's called leaving me hanging...

06:24.183 --> 06:27.675
because my hand
is literally left hanging in the air.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.448
My brothers.

06:33.459 --> 06:36.622
I want you to meet
Boomps, Vidal and Tiny.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.685
My cousin Carlton.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.428
What was that all about?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.795
Where do I put my things?

06:46.038 --> 06:48.199
Let me have my butler get them.

06:48.508 --> 06:49.634
Sorry.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.037
I crack myself up.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.978
You can put them on the floor,
but watch out for my carpet...

06:55.047 --> 06:57.481
'cause it's imported from Persia.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.377
I could do this all day.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.189
Just take them to the bedroom.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.065
Now that Carlton's unpacked,
I could go for grub.

07:19.138 --> 07:21.333
What do I do till you guys get back?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.840
Well, let's see.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.033
Chill.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.376
What's up?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.284
Don't mind me. I'm just here on a bet.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.583
Just give me some time
to acclimate myself.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.750
Applegate? That sounds
like a school word.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.557
I don't like school words.
I can't applegate myself to them.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.865
- That's very funny.
- It ain't supposed to be.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.924
- Sorry.
- I don't like you.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.469
That's kind of a snap decision, isn't it?

07:51.838 --> 07:54.329
You've hardly had time to form an opinion.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.473
That's real mature.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.537
Everybody, put your hands in the air!

08:22.735 --> 08:24.430
What was that all about?

08:25.238 --> 08:26.865
Yo, fellas.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.766
Brother, want to buy a Gucci bag?

08:29.842 --> 08:32.003
My sister already has about eight of them.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.272
- $20.
- I'm really not...

08:33.346 --> 08:34.472
- $2.
- I don't really need...

08:34.547 --> 08:36.947
- 50 cents.
- What are you talking about?

08:37.015 --> 08:38.005
20 cents.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.683
20 cents. That's not a real Gucci bag, is it?

08:40.753 --> 08:42.880
Maybe it is. Maybe it ain't.

08:43.322 --> 08:45.722
All right, look, homey.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.590
You're never going to sell bags that way.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.461
Maybe if you went out
and bought a well-tailored suit...

08:53.533 --> 08:56.525
and lost the earring,
then you'd look like a real salesman.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.365
And that grammar...

09:00.840 --> 09:01.829
What?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.674
Are you trying to suggest
that I don't know how to run my business?

09:09.982 --> 09:12.610
I don't know, Jazz.
I just feel bad for Carlton, man.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.710
What does he know
about living in the 'hood?

09:14.787 --> 09:19.588
I spent half the ride trying
to convince him not to say, "Dyn-o-mite."

09:21.594 --> 09:25.621
I just feel like I'm tossing him to the lions.
You know what I mean?

09:26.499 --> 09:29.559
The Detroit Lions still got
those cheerleaders?

09:30.102 --> 09:32.093
Open the door, man.

09:32.838 --> 09:37.468
<i>Yes, that's right. You can buy property
for no money down.</i>

09:38.945 --> 09:40.572
Yo, what's up?

09:47.453 --> 09:50.081
Carlton, what the hell are you wearing?

09:50.456 --> 09:51.445
Yo, this?

09:52.358 --> 09:54.383
Carlton, you look like a pirate.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.819
Yo, stop fronting.
You know this gear is chill.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.364
Why are you talking like that?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.423
Yo, how you playing me, Prince?

10:02.401 --> 10:04.232
- What?
- Yo, you dissing me.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.895
Come on, man, stop it.

10:08.474 --> 10:11.966
Hey, Prince, lay off of him, man.
We like C-note.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.100
C-note?

10:14.947 --> 10:17.745
Yeah. He was a little stiff,
but he's coming around.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.217
Yeah. He's helping us with our business.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.281
Hey, C-note, how do I figure
my net worth?

10:26.058 --> 10:28.026
Yo, how many times do I gotta tell you?

10:28.094 --> 10:30.824
Write your questions down.
I'll hook you up later.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.421
I'm sorry. That was rude of me, man.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.460
Yo, we cool.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.674
They love me.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.775
Jazz, tell me that this isn't happening.

10:48.214 --> 10:51.547
I don't know, Prince.
I'm starting to like him, too.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.884
Yo, C, I want to thank you for that tip.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.322
I'm going to get me
some of them douche marks.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.792
That's deutsche marks.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.192
Yo, check it out, C. I'm leaving, right?

11:07.266 --> 11:10.827
I'll get back with you later so you can help
me open that Schwab account.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.131
Peace.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.339
C-note, are you still coming
to MacArthur Park tomorrow night?

11:17.410 --> 11:19.173
Yo, I'm with it.

11:23.115 --> 11:25.447
You're going to MacArthur Park at night?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.986
Yeah. My squad's going to sell
some Gucci bags.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.578
It's a sales bonanza.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.653
Sorry. There's no hip-hop word
for sales bonanza.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.085
C, I don't go to MacArthur Park.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.062
What's up, Will?

11:39.265 --> 11:42.063
Not man enough to swing
with the brothers?

11:46.172 --> 11:48.504
Get over here, man.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.837
You have no idea
what MacArthur Park is like.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.208
It's dangerous, man.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.373
If there's any danger,
I'll call the park rangers.

11:59.585 --> 12:02.486
It's not that kind of park, Boo Boo.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.287
Listen, people get killed there.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.955
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

12:12.031 --> 12:14.192
I know exactly
what I'm getting myself into.

12:14.266 --> 12:16.632
I'm tired of you
always talking down to me.

12:16.702 --> 12:20.001
I'll win our bet. And you'll never be able
to make fun of me again.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.973
You know what? The bet is off.
Come on, let's go home.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.806
Hey, leave C-note alone, man.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.941
He ain't leaving till he does my taxes.

12:32.952 --> 12:36.285
Yo. I'm gonna sleep on the floor.

12:50.569 --> 12:53.197
When are Carlton and Will coming home?

12:53.305 --> 12:55.068
They should be here any minute.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.235
These two days have just flown right by.

12:59.145 --> 13:02.774
Geoffrey, did you really enjoy
having Will out of the house that much?

13:02.848 --> 13:05.442
The closest I'll ever get to a bonus.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.580
Yo, my squad, what's up?

13:11.724 --> 13:13.885
- Carlton?
- What happened to you?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.483
Weren't you on your school trip?

13:15.561 --> 13:18.997
I'm quitting school. That's for suckers.
I'm starting my own business.

13:19.064 --> 13:23.228
- I can get $20 for this china dog.
- No, you won't.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.427
$2.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.160
Who's responsible for this?

13:26.238 --> 13:27.705
Listen, I can explain.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.543
Daddy. Stop it!

13:37.116 --> 13:40.108
This is the police!
Carlton, come out with your hands up.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.586
You'll never take me alive.

13:58.637 --> 14:01.265
- Is Hilary ready yet?
- Would you like me to go get her?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.638
Could you?
I don't know what takes her so long...

14:03.709 --> 14:05.574
we're never this late for church.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.305
Has anybody seen Geoffrey this morning?

14:07.379 --> 14:09.677
- No. Why?
- Just wondering where he is.

14:09.748 --> 14:14.242
Philip, his weekends are his own.
It's none of our business where he goes.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.830
Madam. I assumed
you'd be in church by now.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.565
Maybe you'd care to join us.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.674
On reflection, perhaps I should.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.151
I'm ready to go,
but we can't drive too fast...

14:47.219 --> 14:49.779
because things haven't set yet.

14:49.855 --> 14:52.585
If we hurry,
we'll get there before the service starts...

14:52.658 --> 14:55.627
- but we'll have to sit toward the back.
- The back row?

14:55.694 --> 14:58.993
The light is completely different there.
I have to change.

15:00.666 --> 15:03.601
Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv, I'm glad I caught you.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.536
- Why aren't you in San Francisco?
- Where's Carlton?

15:06.705 --> 15:09.037
Before I tell you that, Uncle Phil,
I just want to...

15:09.108 --> 15:10.700
Where's Carlton?

15:12.544 --> 15:13.533
In Compton.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.677
What is he doing in Compton?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.377
A very bad imitation of me.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.711
What?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.252
Look, he just started tripping, Aunt Viv.

15:23.322 --> 15:26.223
See, we had this bet
that he couldn't hang out in the 'hood.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.953
He's just taking it too far.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.928
He's going to MacArthur Park tonight
to sell Korean Gucci bags.

15:30.996 --> 15:34.227
- MacArthur Park?
- Where is he right now?

15:34.366 --> 15:35.663
He's down at Jazz's crib.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.703
I am going down there
and I am bringing my baby back.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.400
Vivian. Calm down.

15:42.641 --> 15:45.769
Now, nobody's going anywhere.
Except Will.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.104
Will? That's me. Where am I going?

15:49.348 --> 15:52.806
You're going down to Jazz's
and you're bringing Carlton back here...

15:52.885 --> 15:54.785
by the time we're back from church.

15:54.853 --> 15:58.619
- See, I can't exactly do that, Uncle Phil.
- Why not?

15:58.691 --> 16:01.159
It's just the way things work
down in the 'hood.

16:01.226 --> 16:04.354
If a brother comes between
a brother and his brothers...

16:04.430 --> 16:07.297
then that brother's considered a mother.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.026
I'll tell you who's a mother: Me.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.468
And I am going there
and I am bringing my baby back.

16:12.538 --> 16:16.167
Vivian. Put your earrings back on.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.835
I don't care how this makes you look
to your friends.

16:20.913 --> 16:24.815
I'm tired of bailing you out.
Why should I always be the heavy?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.386
No. I'm in enough trouble as it is.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.626
Grab a seat, man. Dude's about to explain
variable rate mortgages.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.031
- Later. You gotta come home.
- I'm not leaving.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.730
I called Aunt Viv to tell her
how we was doing in San Francisco...

16:46.105 --> 16:48.130
she gave me some bad news, man.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.732
Geoffrey fell down the back steps,
split his wig.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.572
We gotta go to the hospital.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.872
Knock it off, Will.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.177
I'm not lying, man.
The whole family's down at the hospital.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.910
Do what you want. I'm going down there.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.975
- You're serious?
- Yes.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.020
C-note, you better go, man.

17:03.422 --> 17:04.820
Yeah. Later.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.616
My condolences.

17:08.426 --> 17:10.122
Great. Let's go.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.719
- Carlton.
- Mom.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.420
Aunt Viv, what are you doing here?

17:13.499 --> 17:16.262
What does it look like I'm doing here?
I came to get my boy.

17:16.335 --> 17:19.270
Mom, I can explain.
We were on our way to San Francisco...

17:19.338 --> 17:21.670
when I realized I had
a Sociology report to do...

17:21.740 --> 17:24.071
Don't even try, Carlton.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.838
Will told me everything.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.704
It was a bet.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.614
A bet? I don't care.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.384
You are not going
to MacArthur Park tonight.

17:35.454 --> 17:39.515
In fact, none of you are going
to MacArthur Park tonight.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.016
Wait a minute.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.653
- Boy, do not test me.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.867
Carlton, Will, get your things.
I will be waiting downstairs in the car.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.602
And another thing, this place is a disgrace.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.835
You have a trashcan, honey. Use it.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.773
You went home and told Mom and Dad?

18:03.849 --> 18:05.248
You dimed him out.

18:05.784 --> 18:09.345
I did the right thing.
Carlton was acting irresponsibly.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.413
<i>Carlton was acting in what? In Cosby?</i>

18:12.558 --> 18:14.287
Prince used a school word.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.025
You 5-0'd your own cousin.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.854
- Man, you're getting soft.
- Sellout.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.400
Man, you're about to catch an eye jammy.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.598
You're getting a little pale on us,
ain't you?

18:25.671 --> 18:29.163
- My brother, you wanna take this outside?
- Yo, Prince, chill out.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.641
I can't let him say
that stuff about me, man.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.338
Maybe now you know what it feels like.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.750
What's it like to be in this much trouble?

18:42.521 --> 18:44.989
Why don't you ask Will.
He's been there before.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.095
Well, they're going to do
all the talking anyway...

18:51.163 --> 18:53.688
so you just pretty much nod
and say, "I'm sorry."

18:53.765 --> 18:55.665
And cry if you can.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.697
Have Mom and Dad talked to you yet?

18:59.972 --> 19:03.669
No, but I think I heard Uncle Phil upstairs
testing his belts out.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.577
Look, guys, I know you're worried...

19:06.645 --> 19:08.943
but earlier I was upstairs
with Mom and Dad...

19:09.014 --> 19:11.574
and even though
they were initially upset...

19:11.750 --> 19:14.241
now I really think
they'll overlook the whole thing.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.343
Really?

19:15.420 --> 19:18.446
What, are you kidding?
They're going to kill you guys.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.328
All right, guys. Stand up.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.745
Okay, this is new.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.990
The only way we're going to make it
is if we stick together.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.353
Explain.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.227
It's all Carlton's fault.

20:00.799 --> 20:01.891
Will started it.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.403
- You got there and started tripping.
- You were the one who made the bet.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.064
- It was your idea in the first place.
- You're the one...

20:08.140 --> 20:09.368
Hold it.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.339
I am ashamed of you two.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.046
Not only did you lie to us...

20:15.113 --> 20:17.741
but you put yourselves in danger
for a stupid bet.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.078
But, Mom, we were never
in any real danger.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.279
Well, you are now.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.593
Uncle Phil, at this juncture,
I just want to ask...

20:28.727 --> 20:32.720
is one of us in any more trouble
than the other?

20:33.131 --> 20:36.032
Will, you were the one
who started this whole thing.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.359
- I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.
- "I'm sorry"?

20:38.637 --> 20:40.798
How many times
are we going to hear that?

20:40.939 --> 20:43.806
When will you start
taking responsibility for your actions?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.036
When are you going to grow up, boy?

20:47.546 --> 20:49.070
I'm sorry, Aunt Viv.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.313
Will, sit down.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.510
None of this would have happened...

20:55.587 --> 20:58.078
if you hadn't insisted
on making fun of your cousin.

20:58.156 --> 21:00.181
For a person
who's always going around saying...

21:00.259 --> 21:02.454
"I wish people would let me act
the way I want"...

21:02.527 --> 21:04.017
you're awfully hard on Carlton.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.496
- That was my point.
- That's no excuse.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.728
Just because Will teases you,
you have to do something this foolish?

21:09.801 --> 21:11.769
I know it seemed foolish...

21:11.837 --> 21:14.897
but I had to show him I had
the courage to survive down there.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.702
That's not courage.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.709
Courage is being the way you are,
no matter what anybody says about you.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.178
Will teases me...

21:22.247 --> 21:25.512
but you don't see me going,
"Yo, yo, yo, homey, yo."

21:29.588 --> 21:32.716
There's no "yo" at the end of it.
I'm pretty sure of it.

21:34.259 --> 21:37.660
I'm glad you two had such a fun time
down in the 'hood.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.960
Because we're going to have a fun time
dreaming up your punishment.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.531
Peace out.

21:48.206 --> 21:51.141
I'm gonna go test the lock on my door.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.404
Good night, Carlton.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.207
What do you mean, "Good night"?

21:55.280 --> 21:57.043
This is my time to gloat.

21:57.582 --> 22:00.050
- Gloat?
- I won the bet.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.552
I humiliated you in front of your peers.

22:02.621 --> 22:05.454
Plus, you said I couldn't handle Compton,
and I did.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.321
I'd say it's time to gloat.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.650
Good night, Carlton.

22:10.195 --> 22:13.790
You're just embarrassed
because I beat you at your own game.

22:13.865 --> 22:16.095
I never judge you
for being the way you are...

22:16.168 --> 22:18.102
but you always act
like I don't measure up...

22:18.170 --> 22:20.502
to some rule of blackness
that you carry around.

22:20.572 --> 22:23.473
Hold it. Wait a minute.
You don't judge me?

22:23.542 --> 22:26.067
You do everything
but carry a big old gavel around.

22:26.144 --> 22:29.545
You treat me like some kind of idiot
just 'cause I talk different.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.013
Differently.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.846
Good night, Carlton.

22:36.455 --> 22:38.320
Just so I don't need to tell you later...

22:38.390 --> 22:39.652
I did win the bet.

22:39.725 --> 22:41.716
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.523
Our bet was you couldn't spend
the weekend in Compton...

22:44.596 --> 22:45.620
and you didn't.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.324
That's because you came and got me.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.027
If I hadn't,
you'd have gotten yourself killed.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.961
And why was that important to you?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.563
It wasn't.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.742
Yes, it was.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.675
Admit it, Will. You care about me.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.008
I do not.

23:03.181 --> 23:06.150
Yes, you do. You like me.
You like having me around.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.651
Carlton, take it back, man.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.211
Face it. You've just got to face it.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.756
You love me.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.062
My brother, you wanna take this outside?
