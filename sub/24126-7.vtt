WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.458 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.291
and again

00:31.291 --> 00:34.750
and there's nobody home

00:34.750 --> 00:38.208
to count on a friend

00:38.208 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.750 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.625
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:13.458 --> 01:14.875
Tigger: Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:14.875 --> 01:16.583
It was nice
of Christopher Robin

01:16.583 --> 01:19.125
to let us use his fun stuff
while he's gone.

01:20.875 --> 01:24.125
Yes, and it's too bad
we're not having any fun.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.458
Oh, d-d-dear.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.458
Say, little Piglet,
did you find something to do?

01:31.458 --> 01:34.083
Oh, oh, dear. I was just--

01:34.083 --> 01:35.375
No, no. Don't tell me.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.250
Hmm. I got it.

01:37.250 --> 01:39.458
You was hide-and-seeking,
and I seeked you.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.708
I won, and I didn't even
know I was playing. Hoo hoo!

01:42.708 --> 01:44.583
Oh, I wasn't really
hiding, Tigger.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.708
You see, the thunder--

01:46.708 --> 01:48.291
I'll say you wasn't hiding.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.291
Here, let me show you how.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.750
The only thing tiggers
do better than seeking

01:52.750 --> 01:53.958
is hiding.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.958
There. Hoo! Now I'll
never find you, Piglet.

02:02.333 --> 02:06.125
Why, I believe Piglet's
right here, Tigger.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.833
Well, that was exciting.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.500
What will we do now?

02:10.500 --> 02:13.083
There's all sorts of fun
hiding around this house.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.750
All we got to do is seek it.

02:14.750 --> 02:19.083
And where, pray tell, are we
supposed to start seeking?

02:19.083 --> 02:21.958
Say, Pooh boy, you seeked
Piglet pretty good.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.250
So where do we go
to seek out some fun?

02:24.250 --> 02:26.458
Mm. Well, it seems to me

02:26.458 --> 02:28.958
that we certainly
can't seek out

02:28.958 --> 02:32.750
because out is so very wet
as to be out of the question.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.708
So what's up, Pooh boy?

02:34.708 --> 02:36.416
Up.

02:36.416 --> 02:38.416
Oh, dear.

02:38.416 --> 02:40.875
Isn't up closer
to the thunder?

02:40.875 --> 02:45.000
If you ask me,
not that anybody is,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.875
Pooh means we might find
something fun to do

02:47.875 --> 02:49.000
up in the attic.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.083
The attic? Yipes!

02:52.083 --> 02:55.458
Isn't that the dark, scary
place where things go...

02:55.458 --> 02:57.458
that are never seen again?

02:57.458 --> 02:59.166
Don't be silly, Piglet.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.958
Attics are where things are
stored for a rainy day.

03:01.958 --> 03:04.000
- Yelp!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.750
And that's today.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.208
There's nothing to be
frightened of, Piglet.

03:08.208 --> 03:11.375
Attics are full of awfully
interesting things.

03:11.375 --> 03:15.125
I think it's the "awfully"
part that worries him, Rabbit.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.166
- Oof!
- Oof!
- Oof!

03:18.166 --> 03:19.166
Hawmp!

03:22.500 --> 03:27.166
To make a long story
short, uh-oh.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.708
Tigger: Hoo! We're going to
have fun just getting there.

03:31.708 --> 03:33.208
We are?

03:33.208 --> 03:38.000
Sure. We might even run
into some spookables.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.583
Oh, d-d-dear.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.000
Spookables!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.458
Don't be ridiculous, Tigger.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.833
There's absolutely
nothing to fear,

03:44.833 --> 03:47.625
especially with Pooh
leading the way.

03:47.625 --> 03:48.708
Tigger, Eeyore:
Pooh?

03:48.708 --> 03:50.000
Yes.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Yes, indeed.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.708
Pooh is, as Tigger
pointed out,

03:54.708 --> 03:57.250
the best of us at seeking.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.500
It's only fair he should have
the honor of going first.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.083
Oh, are you really going
to go first, Pooh?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.166
Yes, Piglet.

04:05.166 --> 04:07.166
It seems that I am.

04:07.166 --> 04:10.083
Very slowly.

04:10.083 --> 04:14.083
I'm glad no one thought
about donkeys going first.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.083
You go right ahead,
uh, Pooh.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.125
Uh, uh,
my, that was close.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.250
Oh, it's awfully dark in here.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.500
Don't worry,
little Piglet. Hoo hoo!

04:33.500 --> 04:35.291
Nothing can get us in here.

04:35.291 --> 04:38.583
Unless it got in here first.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.083
Ooh! My goodness gracious!

04:44.125 --> 04:46.291
It appears
this step is safe--

04:46.291 --> 04:48.166
-- but noisy.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.583
Shall I go on, Rabbit?

04:50.583 --> 04:51.708
Tigger?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.000
Faster!

04:58.291 --> 05:00.166
That was close.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.375
Now we should have
nothing to worry about.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.291
- If we're so safe,

05:05.291 --> 05:08.000
why is my heart
still k-knocking?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.958
That's not your heart
knocking. It's--

05:09.958 --> 05:11.166
-

05:11.166 --> 05:12.875
It's-- Oh. Oh, my.

05:12.875 --> 05:17.708
Somebody, or something,
at the door.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.583
That's a relief. Hoo hoo!

05:19.583 --> 05:21.708
For a second there,
I thought we were in trouble.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.625
Tigger, no!

05:23.625 --> 05:26.333
Piglet: Oh, d-d-dear.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.333
Hello, everyone.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.458
Have I missed anything fun?

05:32.875 --> 05:34.875
Oh, Pooh bear.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.250
Now that we're all here,

05:37.250 --> 05:40.708
what are we going to do
about it?

05:40.708 --> 05:44.458
We're going to have some fun
if it's the last thing we do.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.166
So let's get busy
and find some fun.

05:47.166 --> 05:50.291
If, uh, no one minds,
I'll just wait here.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.958
Fun can be too much
for very small animals,

05:52.958 --> 05:54.625
of which I'm one.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.291
Tigger: hoo hoo hoo!

05:56.291 --> 05:58.166
Dummy coming through!

05:58.166 --> 05:59.166
Yipe!

05:59.166 --> 06:00.333
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

06:00.333 --> 06:03.000
Oh, dear, I'm trapped.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Say, this thing is
kind of hard to steer.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Help!

06:14.875 --> 06:16.375
Are you all right?

06:16.375 --> 06:19.416
I'm fine.
But I can't find Piglet.

06:19.416 --> 06:22.500
You found him, Tigger.
You just didn't know it.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.166
What do you know? Hoo hoo!

06:24.166 --> 06:25.875
I was using my head
the whole time,

06:25.875 --> 06:27.458
and I didn't feel a thing.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.625
And Piglet's found a friend.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.500
Say, there's a whole gang
of the little guys.

06:32.500 --> 06:36.625
I think Piglet's found
more than friends.

06:36.625 --> 06:41.625
He's discovered the way
to spend our rainy afternoon.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.875
Congratulations, Piglet.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.875
I was sure
you had it in you.

06:45.875 --> 06:49.625
Or perhaps I should say
you had it on you.

06:50.875 --> 06:54.000
Chess is a wonderful game
for a rainy day,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.458
but some of the pieces
are missing.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.291
Yeah? Which ones?

06:58.291 --> 06:59.958
Uh, which ones?

06:59.958 --> 07:02.625
Well, the, uh, magician
is not here.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.166
And, uh, there's no bishop.

07:04.166 --> 07:08.291
Say, the bish-up sounds like
my kind of guy. Hoo hoo!

07:08.291 --> 07:11.458
And the knight is missing,
a very important piece.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.708
Is there any way
of unmissing them?

07:14.708 --> 07:17.208
Well, I suppose
we could look for them.

07:17.208 --> 07:21.875
Oh, you mean search
the whole dark, spooky attic?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.583
That's the idea, Piglet.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.250
We'll make an adventure
out of it.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.458
, good.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.708
We'll split up
and meet back here.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.875
Tigger,
you look over there.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.500
Pooh, you go that way.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.000
Eeyore,
you look over there.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.583
And, Piglet--

07:36.583 --> 07:37.750
Yes?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.458
You go
look in that old trunk

07:39.458 --> 07:40.875
for the missing knight.

07:42.208 --> 07:43.583
Oh, dear.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.500
All right,
let's get cracking.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.458
The sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

07:49.458 --> 07:51.875
Unless we don't start at all.

07:55.083 --> 07:58.000
Didn't anyone find anything?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.125
I found this.

08:00.125 --> 08:04.000
Eeyore, there aren't any
dragons in the game of chess.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.291
I suppose it all depends

08:06.291 --> 08:08.333
on the way
you want to play it.

08:08.333 --> 08:11.625
Well, we can only hope
Piglet found something.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.833
I don't think he did.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.583
Why don't you think that,
Eeyore?

08:16.583 --> 08:20.083
Because
I just found Piglet.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.958
Hello, Piglet.

08:21.958 --> 08:26.458
Hello, Pooh. Uh, no missing
knights under here.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.625
Then there's no way
we can play chess.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.333
Unless...

08:31.333 --> 08:33.375
There is no unless, Pooh.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.583
How can we play
with missing pieces?

08:35.583 --> 08:38.291
By playing the missing pieces.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.500
Are my ears on too tight,

08:40.500 --> 08:43.000
or is fluff boy making sense?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.833
And Piglet will play
the missing knight.

08:45.833 --> 08:48.000
Me? But why?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.375
Because you are
what you can't find.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.458
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

08:51.458 --> 08:53.000
Come on, Piglet.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.500
Let's see what we can find
for very small k-nights.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.250
Now that's what I call
a k-night to remember.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.875
And all dressed up
for a midnight smackerel.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.750
Now let's hurry and get ready

09:05.750 --> 09:07.625
so we can get on
with the game.

09:07.625 --> 09:11.000
If you don't mind,
we'll just sit here

09:11.000 --> 09:13.625
and tell each other
what time it isn't.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.000
I can't be a knight.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.416
Knights are large
and strong and b-b-brave.

09:19.416 --> 09:23.458
I'm just a very small piglet
who hides under tables.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.708
I must find the knight.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.250
Oh, dear!

09:29.250 --> 09:31.000
Well, are we all ready?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.583
As soon as we find our knight.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.083
Piglet! Where are you?

09:36.083 --> 09:37.333
Whoops!

09:37.333 --> 09:40.500
Oh, dear. There's no one here.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.458
Now I'll have to
play the knight.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.708
Tigger: Yoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
K-night!

09:44.708 --> 09:47.166
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

09:47.166 --> 09:49.458
Here I am, Tigger.
Wait for me.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.166
Piglet: Uh-oh.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.708
Where am I?

09:57.708 --> 10:00.208
There you are, you sneaky
little k-night.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.000
Hoo hoo! I knew I'd find you.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.708
Tigger, what happened?

10:03.708 --> 10:05.875
Tiggers? Where are they?

10:05.875 --> 10:07.583
Better still, what are they?

10:07.583 --> 10:10.875
Why, they're--
I mean, it's you.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.583
It is?

10:12.583 --> 10:15.208
Oh, yes. You're the one
and only Tigger.

10:15.208 --> 10:18.291
I like the sound of that,
but I'm not Tigger.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.083
I'm the Bishop of Bounce.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.708
- See?
- Yipes!

10:23.708 --> 10:26.166
But you can call me Tigger
if you want to.

10:26.166 --> 10:29.166
It is a pretty spiffy name,
after all. Hoo hoo hoo!

10:29.166 --> 10:33.166
And you, little k-night,
are just what I'm looking for.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.125
- I am.
- In fact,

10:35.125 --> 10:37.333
the whole kingdom's
been looking for you.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.875
I'm probably not going to
like the answer to this,

10:39.875 --> 10:41.708
but I simply must ask.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.083
Why me?

10:43.083 --> 10:45.750
How are we supposed
to fight the dragon

10:45.750 --> 10:48.000
without a k-night
in shining armor?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.083
Dragon? Oh, dear.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.833
You want me
to fight a what?

10:56.833 --> 10:58.416
Hawmp!

10:58.416 --> 11:00.875
Hee-Hawmp!

11:00.875 --> 11:03.583
A one of them:
a dreadful dragon.

11:03.583 --> 11:07.375
I really don't think I could
fight a dreadful dragon.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.458
You're a k-night,
aren't you?

11:10.458 --> 11:13.625
Oh, no. Not at all.

11:13.625 --> 11:16.333
That's shiny armor you're
wearing, isn't it?

11:16.333 --> 11:17.708
Well, yes, but--

11:17.708 --> 11:19.625
And k-nights in shiny armor

11:19.625 --> 11:22.458
fight dreadful dragons,
hmm?

11:22.458 --> 11:23.750
Well, yes, but--

11:23.750 --> 11:25.458
Then come on.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.166
I've been looking for
a k-night like you all day.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.166
Hoo hoo!

11:31.291 --> 11:34.166
You dare bounce
a great wizard?

11:34.166 --> 11:37.708
Do you want me
to turn you into a snail?

11:37.708 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, yeah. Hoo hoo.
But later.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I got to get this k-night
to His Royal Kingness.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.583
Must be spring.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.125
The knights
are getting shorter.

11:46.125 --> 11:49.250
Before the,
ahem, interruption,

11:49.250 --> 11:53.000
I was about to
conjure one up myself.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.583
So if you'll excuse me.

11:55.583 --> 11:59.416
O great Whoozis
and mighty Whatnot,

11:59.416 --> 12:02.458
hear my magic words.

12:02.458 --> 12:06.583
Eye of potato,
ear of corn.

12:06.583 --> 12:10.375
Say, not half bad.
Not even a quarter bad.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.208
Carrot cake
and vegetable stew.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.708
Bring us a knight...

12:15.708 --> 12:17.500
who fights dragons, too.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.416
--

12:21.416 --> 12:23.708
where's the knight?
Where is he?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.458
Oh, no! Oh, my!

12:25.458 --> 12:27.458
I'm a frog! A frog!

12:27.458 --> 12:29.458
What went wrong?

12:29.458 --> 12:32.708
See you around the lily
pond, o great wizard.

12:32.708 --> 12:36.416
Come on, k-night.
I got to get you
to His Royal Poohness,

12:36.416 --> 12:38.125
the king of all Chessland.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.416
King who?

12:39.416 --> 12:41.375
King Pooh. That's who.

12:41.375 --> 12:42.458
Hoo hoo hoo!

12:48.583 --> 12:51.500
Greetings,
Your Royal Royaltiness.

12:53.708 --> 12:56.708
Oh, uh, is lunch served?

12:56.708 --> 12:58.708
No, Your Most Lowly Highness.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.250
I bring you good news.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.583
I bring you one
dragon slayer to go.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.583
How very nice.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.291
You've come
to fight the dragon

13:07.291 --> 13:09.416
who's been such
a bother to us all?

13:09.416 --> 13:13.125
Well, uh, no, actually, I was
just passing through, and--

13:13.125 --> 13:16.083
Hawmp! Hawmp!

13:19.375 --> 13:21.708
Oh, my.
Will you look at the time?

13:21.708 --> 13:23.583
I really must be going.

13:23.583 --> 13:27.416
If I'm not back soon, start
the dragon fight without me.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.458
Oof!

13:28.458 --> 13:31.416
Eh, can't go
slaying dragons

13:31.416 --> 13:34.583
dressed like that.
Nope. No, sir.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.458
Just won't do.

13:36.458 --> 13:40.583
Yep. I can see
possibilities here.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.625
Oh, I don't know about this.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.333
That's one top-of-the-line
dragon fighting outfit.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.583
Notice the quality fabric,

13:51.583 --> 13:53.875
the low-cut hemline.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.166
All the rage this year.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.583
It's you, K-night Piglet.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.000
It's you.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.958
Just look at how
that shiny silveriness

14:02.958 --> 14:04.458
sets off your eyes.

14:04.458 --> 14:05.625
Rabbit:
No. No, no, no.

14:07.708 --> 14:10.458
You dare swat a wizard?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.458
Hmm. The nerve.

14:12.458 --> 14:16.458
Hmm. This suit of armor
is missing something.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.833
Perhaps
someone else to wear it?

14:18.833 --> 14:21.000
Ah! Jumpin' crawdaddies.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.625
I know. What you need
is a shield.

14:24.625 --> 14:26.708
A shield is
all well and good,

14:26.708 --> 14:29.875
but to fight a dragon,
he needs a magic shield.

14:29.875 --> 14:31.583
If you'll excuse me,

14:31.583 --> 14:33.583
I really do
have to be somewhere.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.458
Somewhere where?

14:35.458 --> 14:37.208
Somewhere else?

14:37.208 --> 14:40.458
Okay, a magic shield.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.250
But no chartreuse.

14:42.250 --> 14:46.166
I simply will not
touch chartreuse.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.500
By dingie, a shield
as good as this

14:50.500 --> 14:53.458
doesn't need any magic
mumbo-jumbo.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.625
Hmm. Without my magic,

14:55.625 --> 14:57.875
it's just a silly pile
of metal.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.208
I'm the shield expert
around here.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.208
And I'm the whiz
at wizardry.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.875
Oh, keep telling yourself,
Piglet, it's just a dream.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.333
It's just a dream.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.833
Don't look now,

15:09.833 --> 15:11.875
but we're short
one short k-night.

15:11.875 --> 15:14.583
Here, boy.
Here, k-nighty k-night.

15:14.583 --> 15:17.708
Why, I do believe
I see a knight now,

15:17.708 --> 15:19.708
and he's crawling
toward the door.

15:19.708 --> 15:23.083
It's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.625
Look at how bad
he wants to fight.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.000
that dreadful dragon.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.416
Uh, heh heh,
if you'll excuse me,

15:30.416 --> 15:32.000
I think my horse
is double-parked.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.250
Ah-ah-ah. Doesn't
seem too likely,

15:35.250 --> 15:38.375
seeing as how horses
haven't been invented yet.

15:38.375 --> 15:41.750
Hawmp!

15:41.750 --> 15:45.458
Uh, perhaps you might
save my kingdom now,

15:45.458 --> 15:47.958
while there is still
a kingdom to save,

15:47.958 --> 15:50.875
Uh, first I must
cast the magic spell

15:50.875 --> 15:52.958
to make his shield
unbreakable.

15:52.958 --> 15:55.333
Alakazam and hullabaloo,

15:55.333 --> 16:00.125
make this shield strong
as ten shields times two.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.875
Uh, some days it doesn't pay
to get out of the nest.

16:05.875 --> 16:09.375
Hawmp!

16:09.375 --> 16:12.833
Hurry, Your K-nightliness!
We're running out of time,

16:12.833 --> 16:14.250
not to mention castle.

16:14.250 --> 16:17.083
No, no, no. I have
one last spell,

16:17.083 --> 16:19.708
the most powerful
spell of all.

16:19.708 --> 16:21.125
It will turn you

16:21.125 --> 16:23.750
into the largest,
most heroic knight ever.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.958
Oh--

16:24.958 --> 16:27.125
- However--
- ...dear.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.625
...this spell
will only work once.

16:29.625 --> 16:33.708
So do not use it until
you absolutely must.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.875
You simple
repeat these words.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.583
Magnificent magic
most mysterious,

16:38.583 --> 16:41.458
make meek me make a monster
into mozzarella marmalade.

16:43.958 --> 16:47.000
What is going on
with these spells?

16:48.333 --> 16:50.000
Oh, don't feel badly.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.083
I can't spell
very well, either.

16:52.083 --> 16:55.125
Hawmp!

16:55.125 --> 16:57.458
Magnificent m-m-magic

16:57.458 --> 17:00.125
m-m-most mysterious.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.125
Oh, m-m-my.

17:03.708 --> 17:06.833
I'm just going to have to put
my very small foot down

17:06.833 --> 17:08.500
and say "I'm not
a real knight,

17:08.500 --> 17:10.333
"and so I cannot
fight your dragon.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.625
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is."

17:16.875 --> 17:19.708
Everyone, there's
something I must say.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.166
Yes, and so you shall

17:22.166 --> 17:24.708
as soon as we have said
what we must say.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.000
You're our only hope.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.625
You got to save us.

17:28.625 --> 17:32.500
If you don't make marmalade
out of that monster,

17:32.500 --> 17:34.708
we'll be in a real jam.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.375
And when you come back,

17:36.375 --> 17:40.583
I will be happy to name you
the Knight to Remember.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.083
Now what did you have to say?

17:43.083 --> 17:46.166
Uh, which way to the dragon?

17:46.166 --> 17:49.250
- All: That way.
- Very well. I'll do it.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.000
It will be an honor
to fight the dragon
and save the kingdom.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.750
Hawmp!

18:09.708 --> 18:11.958
Marvelous m-m-music,

18:11.958 --> 18:15.458
make me meek as marmalade.

18:15.458 --> 18:18.583
Oh, dear.

18:18.583 --> 18:21.125
I hope the dragon doesn't mind
my dropping in like this.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.875
Oh, he must be
away on a visit.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.416
I'll come back later.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.958
Hawmp!

18:33.958 --> 18:35.375
Oh, d-d-dear.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.750
Macaroni marmalade, uh,

18:37.750 --> 18:40.125
mockingbird milkshake.

18:40.125 --> 18:43.000
This isn't so very terrible.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.375
Could use a few curtains
and maybe some flowers and--

18:46.375 --> 18:49.875
Hawmp! Hawmp!

18:49.875 --> 18:52.250
I must remember
I'm a b-b-brave

18:52.250 --> 18:53.875
and f-f-fearless knight.

19:00.458 --> 19:04.083
It's up to m-m-me
to save the kingdom.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.125
Yipe!

19:13.458 --> 19:15.333
Help!

19:15.333 --> 19:18.333
You have nothing at all
to f-f-fear, Piglet,

19:18.333 --> 19:23.125
not with your m-m-magic shield
which cannot be b-b-broken.

19:23.125 --> 19:27.166
Hawmp!

19:32.583 --> 19:34.708
I suppose I really
should expect this

19:34.708 --> 19:37.708
from a wizard who turns
himself into frogs.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.333
Magnificent m-m-mustard,

19:41.333 --> 19:44.458
uh, mismatched m-m-mushrooms.

19:44.458 --> 19:47.958
M-M-Moonstruck marigolds,

19:47.958 --> 19:50.500
Magnificent magic
most mysterious,

19:50.500 --> 19:54.000
make meek me make a monster
into mozzarella marmalade.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.500
Oh, no. It didn't work.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.125
I'm still me.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.375
Eeyore: Worked for
one of us anyway.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.750
Who are you?

20:05.750 --> 20:08.625
Formerly Eeyore the Dragon.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.708
Now just plain old Eeyore.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.875
You're the dragon?

20:13.875 --> 20:18.583
Was. Got myself turned
into one last week.

20:18.583 --> 20:21.583
That's the trouble
with this place.

20:21.583 --> 20:25.458
Never know what you're
going to get turned into.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.166
Eternally grateful.

20:28.166 --> 20:31.500
Don't suppose I'll ever
be able to repay you.

20:31.500 --> 20:35.708
I believe I may know a way.

20:38.416 --> 20:39.708
Brave Piglet,

20:39.708 --> 20:41.875
who rescued us
from the dragon

20:41.875 --> 20:45.583
and saved the kingdom,
and all before lunch,

20:45.583 --> 20:50.708
I name you, before I forget,
the Knight to Remember.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.958
, it's all
in a knight's work.

20:54.958 --> 20:57.000
And now, Knight Piglet,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.458
is there anything
we can do for you?

20:59.458 --> 21:01.333
Well...

21:02.500 --> 21:03.708
To grant the wish

21:03.708 --> 21:05.708
of Knight to Remember Piglet,

21:05.708 --> 21:07.958
the Knight to Remember
is now--

21:07.958 --> 21:09.750
-- Eeyore.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.000
Words fail me.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.416
If you'll excuse me,

21:13.416 --> 21:15.291
I really must get
back to my trunk.

21:15.291 --> 21:16.708
- Goodbye.
- Good night, k-night.

21:16.708 --> 21:18.458
Don't forget
to write, knight.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.583
Tigger: Here, Piglet, Piglet.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.250
Here, Piglet, Piglet.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.958
Rabbit: Piglet,
where are you?

21:30.708 --> 21:33.000
Why are you hiding
yourself in there?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.708
Oh, but I wasn't hiding.
I was--

21:35.708 --> 21:37.333
It's only
a bit of a rainstorm.

21:37.333 --> 21:40.583
Nothing
to be too scared of.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.833
Oh, I'm not. I was just--

21:42.833 --> 21:44.375
Was it perhaps, Piglet,

21:44.375 --> 21:46.708
that you were too timid
to be our knight?

21:46.708 --> 21:50.583
Well, yes, Pooh.
I was.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.333
But I'm not anymore.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.291
Then come along,
everyone.

21:54.291 --> 21:56.583
Let's finish
this chess game.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.875
Hawmp!

21:58.875 --> 22:02.958
Hee-hawmp! Hee-hawmp!
