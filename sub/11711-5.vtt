20:53.719 --> 20:56.588
I'm sorry, Russell.
It's over.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.456
What?

20:57.456 --> 20:59.958
What, you're
breaking up with me?

21:01.026 --> 21:03.529
But I have shelter.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.731
That's the thing.
You're just too trapped

21:05.731 --> 21:07.733
by your material possessions.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.869
Oh, forgive me
for having an iPod.

21:12.638 --> 21:16.508
Well, we did have
some good times, didn't we?

21:16.508 --> 21:18.344
Kind of.

21:18.344 --> 21:22.180
Wow. Okay, great.
Um, I'll see you around.

21:22.180 --> 21:26.552
Oh, and here's
some leftover chicken àà la king.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.420
Fabulous bag.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.821
You like it?

21:29.821 --> 21:34.293
Love it.
Ha-ha! It's yours.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.827
You'll be back.

21:36.227 --> 21:39.064
