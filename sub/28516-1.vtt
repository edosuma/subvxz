Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:27.665 --> 00:28.498
Welcome.

00:29.955 --> 00:31.188
I'm Martin Jarvis.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.963
Ghost and horror stories have
always been part of our world,

00:36.965 --> 00:40.513
and we invite you to share
in a few of these tales.

00:40.515 --> 00:42.668
Some you'll know, some you won't.

00:43.955 --> 00:46.273
I hope you enjoy the series.

00:46.275 --> 00:49.598
This is the first of our chilling tales,

00:50.455 --> 00:53.833
and a strangely frightening story it is,

00:53.835 --> 00:57.418
with even a moral lesson at its heart.

00:59.275 --> 01:01.829
You'll hear more quite soon.

01:02.875 --> 01:06.233
The story was written by W. W. Jacobs,

01:06.235 --> 01:09.738
a prolific teller of short
tales to chill your blood.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.663
The time is about 1890,

01:12.665 --> 01:15.843
the location the industrial
North of England.

01:15.845 --> 01:19.853
Factories abound, and
most people have work.

01:19.855 --> 01:24.353
The British are masters
of India, the British Raj,

01:24.355 --> 01:26.043
and many people make their lives

01:26.045 --> 01:29.313
and their fortunes out there.

01:29.315 --> 01:31.973
The British Army still
has a strong presence

01:31.975 --> 01:33.458
on the Indian continent.

01:34.725 --> 01:39.153
Our heroes, if we can call
them that, are the Whites.

01:39.155 --> 01:41.393
A simple family, not wealthy,

01:41.395 --> 01:44.643
but they're content
with their lot in life.

01:44.645 --> 01:46.945
Not too different from
many families of today.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.713
The Whites live in a modest house,

01:49.715 --> 01:52.458
a house which we would now call Victorian.

01:53.455 --> 01:55.783
Mr. and Mrs. White had their only son,

01:55.785 --> 01:57.583
Herbert, late in life.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.453
In fact, he was almost
certainly a surprise.

02:00.455 --> 02:04.553
Herbert is 24, he works in
a nearby industrial factory.

02:04.555 --> 02:07.803
Mr. White is in his 60s, semi-retired,

02:07.805 --> 02:09.907
but he does odd jobs for local people.

02:10.745 --> 02:15.745
Mrs. White is a typically
hard-working housewife of the day.

02:15.975 --> 02:19.923
They've saved for their old
age, so though, as I said,

02:19.925 --> 02:23.518
certainly not well off,
they have enough to get by.

02:25.305 --> 02:28.588
This is their story.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.223
Hark at that wind.

03:13.237 --> 03:14.570
I'm listening.

03:19.745 --> 03:20.578
Check.

03:23.250 --> 03:26.167
I shouldn't think he'll come now.

03:29.731 --> 03:33.598
Mate.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.878
That's the trouble
with living so far out,

03:35.880 --> 03:39.293
no one wants to come to
such an isolated place.

03:39.295 --> 03:43.133
Nevermind, dear,
you'll win the next game.

03:43.135 --> 03:46.583
Dad, I know I keep saying this,

03:46.585 --> 03:48.285
but why don't we get gas lighting?

03:49.445 --> 03:52.363
It's not like you can't afford it.

03:52.365 --> 03:56.433
Besides, your chess is about
as good as Mother's knitting.

03:56.435 --> 03:57.773
Cheeky monkey.

03:57.775 --> 03:59.208
Yes you are, and all.

04:00.296 --> 04:03.854
And you know I don't want any
of them newfangled things.

04:03.856 --> 04:08.290
Just my oil and candles, that's just fine.

04:08.292 --> 04:10.683
And my eyesight's very
good, thank you very much,

04:10.685 --> 04:13.417
so set the pieces up again.

04:16.615 --> 04:20.027
Blow me if that isn't him after all.

04:32.755 --> 04:34.448
Hey Mother, Herbert.

04:36.525 --> 04:39.689
This is my old friend
Sergeant Major Morris.

04:39.691 --> 04:41.063
- Pleased to meet you.
- Oh.

04:41.065 --> 04:44.023
20 years he's
been gone away in India.

04:44.025 --> 04:45.716
He was just a lad when he went away.

04:46.969 --> 04:49.923
Well it doesn't seem to
have done him much harm.

04:49.925 --> 04:51.913
You'll take a drop of
whiskey, Sergeant Major,

04:51.915 --> 04:54.073
to ward off the chill of this awful night.

04:54.075 --> 04:55.862
Yes, of course he will.

05:01.155 --> 05:03.728
Tell us about this great country of India.

05:05.243 --> 05:06.743
Thank you, ma'am.

05:06.745 --> 05:08.583
This is very welcome.

05:08.585 --> 05:12.103
Yes, it's an amazing place, India.

05:12.105 --> 05:14.353
Full of strange sights.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.838
Fakirs, elephants,

05:17.785 --> 05:20.148
largest animals you've ever seen.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.868
And magic.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.438
Oh yes, and the magic.

05:35.305 --> 05:36.455
Take this little thing.

05:38.065 --> 05:39.538
A sort of talisman.

05:41.405 --> 05:42.238
A monkey's paw.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.133
A monkey's paw with a spell upon it.

05:48.135 --> 05:49.035
How do you mean?

05:49.935 --> 05:52.043
This little monkey's paw,

05:52.045 --> 05:54.168
well, it's had a spell put on it.

05:55.575 --> 05:57.738
It's had a spell put
on it by an old fakir,

05:58.825 --> 06:03.263
who wanted to show that
fate ruled people's lives,

06:03.265 --> 06:08.058
and those who interfered with
it had nothing but misery.

06:10.365 --> 06:14.143
He put a spell on it so
that three different people

06:14.145 --> 06:15.838
could have three wishes from it.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.533
What do you mean?

06:18.535 --> 06:20.158
Have you had three wishes?

06:22.145 --> 06:23.775
I have had.

06:23.777 --> 06:26.643
What were they?

06:26.645 --> 06:28.095
I think I'd rather not say.

06:29.755 --> 06:31.608
But I kept them simple.

06:33.275 --> 06:34.403
The first man who had it,

06:34.405 --> 06:38.638
well, for his third wish,
he wished for death.

06:39.845 --> 06:41.395
And that's how I came about it.

06:48.425 --> 06:50.563
You've had your three wishes.

06:50.565 --> 06:51.898
What do you keep it for?

06:55.225 --> 06:57.113
I suppose I had an idea
that I might sell it,

06:57.115 --> 06:59.238
but I don't think so now.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.758
It's brought nothing but misery.

07:06.075 --> 07:07.475
Don't burn it!

07:11.745 --> 07:13.083
Better to let it burn.

07:13.085 --> 07:14.435
What did you do that for?

07:16.447 --> 07:18.765
If you don't want it, I'll keep it.

07:23.435 --> 07:26.438
If you must keep it, then
don't blame me for what happens.

07:27.345 --> 07:29.813
My advice is to pitch
it into the fire again,

07:29.815 --> 07:30.718
where it belongs.

07:35.035 --> 07:36.185
What do I do with it?

07:37.385 --> 07:40.508
Hold it in your
right hand and wish out loud.

07:43.315 --> 07:46.365
But I must warn you of the consequences.

07:47.825 --> 07:50.525
Well you might wish for
four pair of hands for me.

07:50.527 --> 07:55.527
I could do with the help.

07:56.284 --> 07:57.885
But I must warn you.

07:57.887 --> 08:01.813
If you're going to wish, wish sensibly.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.338
Of course I will.

08:06.965 --> 08:09.191
Now come
on and have your supper,

08:09.193 --> 08:10.843
there's plenty to eat.

08:10.845 --> 08:11.678
Come on.

08:17.265 --> 08:20.823
And they settle back to
enjoy a friendly supper,

08:20.825 --> 08:24.633
and to listen to more
fantastic tales of India.

08:24.635 --> 08:25.893
Until eventually, it's time

08:25.895 --> 08:28.628
for Sergeant Major Morris to leave.

08:37.674 --> 08:41.423
Well my dear friend,
remember what I said,

08:41.424 --> 08:43.732
and be careful with that
damned monkey's paw.

08:43.735 --> 08:45.968
Oh, don't you worry, I will.

08:47.855 --> 08:50.258
Thank you, Mrs. White,
for a marvelous spread.

08:51.655 --> 08:53.443
And you, young Herbert.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.888
Take good care of yourself.

08:55.955 --> 08:57.052
Thank you.

08:57.054 --> 08:59.463
Good night, Sergeant Major.

08:59.465 --> 09:00.660
- Good night.
- Lovely to see you.

09:00.662 --> 09:03.003
- Good night, Sergeant Morris.
- Good night.

09:03.005 --> 09:04.483
He's an interesting man.

09:04.485 --> 09:07.201
Now let's take this lot off on the side.

09:07.203 --> 09:09.983
It's alright, Mother,
I'll do it in the morning.

09:09.985 --> 09:11.338
Oh thank you, love.

09:12.365 --> 09:13.948
I'm fair wore out.

09:16.385 --> 09:17.553
Yes.

09:17.555 --> 09:20.863
I offered him something for
it, but he wouldn't take it.

09:20.865 --> 09:23.143
Pressed me to throw it away again.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.723
As if you'd do that.

09:24.725 --> 09:26.650
Why, we're gonna be rich.

09:26.652 --> 09:28.788
And then Mother won't
nag you anymore, Dad.

09:28.790 --> 09:29.623
Oh, you.

09:33.666 --> 09:34.499
Go on.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.476
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

09:41.155 --> 09:43.158
I don't know what to wish for.

09:44.295 --> 09:46.148
Seems to me I have all I want.

09:47.565 --> 09:49.113
You'd be quite happy if the
house were paid for, though,

09:49.115 --> 09:50.015
wouldn't you, Dad?

09:51.805 --> 09:54.623
Yes, Son, you're quite right there.

09:54.625 --> 09:56.198
That would be a burden lifted.

10:03.145 --> 10:07.849
I wish for 200 pounds.

10:12.264 --> 10:14.131
It moved.

10:14.133 --> 10:14.964
It moved!

10:16.605 --> 10:18.655
It twisted in my hand, just like a snake!

10:25.025 --> 10:28.198
I don't see any money,
and I doubt I ever shall.

10:31.285 --> 10:33.183
It must have been your imagination

10:33.185 --> 10:35.633
that it twisted, my dear.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.228
It must have been your fancy.

10:39.088 --> 10:41.118
Gave me quite a fright, I can tell you.

10:43.584 --> 10:45.568
Only one piece, no harm done.

10:52.572 --> 10:56.253
Well, it's time for
you and I to go to bed.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.758
That's quite enough
excitement for one night.

11:01.584 --> 11:03.234
Well that was a disappointment.

11:05.535 --> 11:08.085
I expect you'll find the
cash tied up in a big bag.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.563
In the middle of your bed,

11:10.565 --> 11:12.818
with a horrible monkey
squatted on top of it.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.027
Night, Mum.

11:20.029 --> 11:21.196
Night, love.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.893
Night, Dad.

11:29.465 --> 11:30.828
Are you coming, dear?

11:32.069 --> 11:32.902
Yes.

11:34.305 --> 11:35.138
Yes.

11:37.835 --> 11:39.228
Truly amazing, that was.

11:41.629 --> 11:42.462
Amazing.

13:12.832 --> 13:14.743
Wonder where our Herbert is.

13:14.745 --> 13:17.228
He'll not have much time
to eat his sandwich.

13:22.605 --> 13:23.438
Who's that?

13:29.835 --> 13:30.779
I need to talk to you

13:30.781 --> 13:32.976
and your wife, Mr. White.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.233
Sure.

13:34.235 --> 13:37.083
Well Mother, it's Mr. Jackson,

13:37.085 --> 13:39.028
the foreman from Herbert's factory.

13:40.405 --> 13:42.003
Please take a seat, Mr. Jackson.

13:42.005 --> 13:44.505
I prefer to stand, Mr.
White, if you don't mind.

13:46.261 --> 13:49.593
Oh my god, it's Herbert, isn't it?

13:49.595 --> 13:50.628
Is he alright?

13:51.715 --> 13:53.063
Tell me he's alright.

13:53.065 --> 13:55.333
I'm afraid there's been an accident.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.013
Herbert seemed rather
distracted this morning.

13:58.015 --> 13:59.938
He knows he has to be very vigilant.

14:00.875 --> 14:04.668
But as I say, he wasn't
his normal self, and well,

14:06.335 --> 14:08.038
he got caught in the machinery.

14:09.135 --> 14:10.953
Is he badly hurt?

14:10.955 --> 14:12.473
I'm so sorry, we turned the machine off

14:12.475 --> 14:15.902
as quick as we could, but
it wasn't quick enough.

14:17.296 --> 14:19.213
He's not dead, is he?

14:20.119 --> 14:24.463
Tell me he's not dead.

14:24.465 --> 14:27.568
I am so sorry, and so is the firm.

14:28.415 --> 14:30.283
It was a terrible accident,

14:30.285 --> 14:32.285
but not really the fault of the company.

14:33.275 --> 14:35.075
They will compensate you, of course.

14:37.385 --> 14:38.218
How much?

14:43.255 --> 14:47.216
Well, they thought 200 pound
would be more than generous

14:47.218 --> 14:52.218
in the circumstances.

14:56.965 --> 14:59.875
The sad couple bury
their only beloved son

15:01.095 --> 15:03.273
and return to their lives,

15:03.275 --> 15:06.268
humbled and disconsolate.

15:34.675 --> 15:39.643
About a week passes, and
the lives of our heroes,

15:39.645 --> 15:44.403
I really shouldn't call them
that, are paralyzed with grief.

15:44.405 --> 15:47.378
They're quite unable to
resume any kind of normality.

15:56.474 --> 15:58.057
The monkey's paw!

15:58.945 --> 16:01.442
The monkey's paw, where is it?

16:01.444 --> 16:05.270
The monkey's paw, where is it?

16:05.272 --> 16:07.101
What is it, love?

16:07.103 --> 16:08.333
What's the matter?

16:08.335 --> 16:10.593
The monkey's paw!

16:10.595 --> 16:12.741
Why didn't I think of it before?

16:12.743 --> 16:13.896
What do you mean?

16:13.898 --> 16:16.433
We've only had one wish.

16:16.435 --> 16:20.193
We've got two more, we can
wish our boy alive again!

16:20.195 --> 16:22.483
Wasn't one wish enough?

16:22.485 --> 16:24.373
Have you gone mad, woman?

16:24.375 --> 16:27.013
It was just a terrible coincidence.

16:27.015 --> 16:28.913
There is no magic!

16:28.915 --> 16:30.823
We can make another wish!

16:30.825 --> 16:33.103
We can make him alive again.

16:33.105 --> 16:34.603
Get the paw!

16:34.605 --> 16:36.918
Oh come on.

16:43.838 --> 16:45.473
A wish.

16:45.475 --> 16:46.753
Wish!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.403
Wish!

16:48.405 --> 16:50.019
Wish!

16:50.021 --> 16:52.408
Go on, wish!

16:55.515 --> 16:58.038
I wish for our son to be alive again.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.528
It's Herbert!

17:57.530 --> 17:59.383
I know it is, it's our son!

17:59.385 --> 18:02.453
It's nothing, you're imagining things.

18:02.455 --> 18:03.333
You're too upset.

18:03.335 --> 18:05.663
It's my son, I know it is.

18:05.665 --> 18:06.943
Let me go, you wretched man,

18:06.945 --> 18:09.023
you will not hold me back from him!

18:09.025 --> 18:12.008
Ella, think what you're
doing, don't let it in!

18:12.885 --> 18:15.333
Jackson said he was
mutilated by the machine,

18:15.335 --> 18:17.183
- think what he might look like!
- No!

18:17.185 --> 18:19.383
For god's sake, don't let it in!

18:19.385 --> 18:21.903
They wouldn't even let
us see him in his coffin!

18:21.905 --> 18:25.939
The lid was down when we got
there, it won't be our Herbert!

18:25.941 --> 18:27.836
It won't be our son!

18:27.838 --> 18:30.397
You're afraid of your own son!

18:30.399 --> 18:33.128
Let me go!

18:33.130 --> 18:35.049
I'm coming, Herbert!

18:35.051 --> 18:37.301
I'm coming, my darling son!

18:42.973 --> 18:46.410
Oh for god's sake, help me, it's your son!

18:50.303 --> 18:52.449
Herbert, Herbert!

18:52.451 --> 18:53.678
Herbert!

18:53.680 --> 18:54.513
Herbert!

18:56.499 --> 18:57.985
Herbert!

18:57.987 --> 18:59.070
Mummy's here!

19:08.036 --> 19:10.407
Come here, Mother's here, love!

19:10.409 --> 19:11.242
Herbert.

19:13.878 --> 19:14.711
Herbert?

19:40.278 --> 19:43.945
I'm sorry, love, I had to do it.

19:45.204 --> 19:47.537
It was the only thing to do.

19:57.595 --> 20:01.423
So as you can imagine,
the Whites never recover

20:01.425 --> 20:03.825
from the tragedy of losing their only son

20:05.575 --> 20:08.058
in such evil circumstances.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.808
All victims of their own wishes.

20:15.755 --> 20:18.358
We often wish for what we do not have.

20:19.565 --> 20:22.538
For some magic perhaps to
improve our lot in life.

20:23.655 --> 20:24.908
But here, sadly,

20:25.745 --> 20:30.373
the old adage beware of what you wish for

20:30.375 --> 20:33.978
proved horribly true
for this little family.

20:36.545 --> 20:41.295
However, my friends, I look
forward to seeing you again

20:42.175 --> 20:44.408
for our next chilling tale.

20:46.165 --> 20:47.263
Bye for now.

21:53.885 --> 21:57.483
Our next chilling
tale, The Tell-Tale Heart,

21:57.485 --> 21:59.873
was published in 1843,

21:59.875 --> 22:04.382
and written by that great
American writer, Edgar Allen Poe.

22:05.605 --> 22:07.833
The story tells of a young man

22:07.835 --> 22:11.263
driven to the point of insanity

22:11.265 --> 22:15.842
by his neighbor's
vulture-like staring eye.

22:17.405 --> 22:21.173
We might say our hero
is suffering from OCD,

22:21.175 --> 22:23.483
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,

22:23.485 --> 22:26.593
which finally drives him over the edge,

22:26.595 --> 22:29.908
into total madness and murder.

22:30.905 --> 22:34.240
Here is his tragic story.

22:38.822 --> 22:40.560
True, nervous,

22:40.562 --> 22:43.772
very dreadfully nervous
I have been and am.

22:45.393 --> 22:47.530
But why will you say that I am mad?

22:47.532 --> 22:50.823
Mad men know nothing.

22:50.825 --> 22:53.258
However, my senses were sharpened.

22:54.145 --> 22:56.447
Above all, the sense of hearing acute.

22:58.315 --> 22:59.515
You should have seen me.

23:01.445 --> 23:04.348
I did nothing to make you think me mad.

23:10.895 --> 23:13.438
I heard all things in Heaven and in Earth.

23:14.398 --> 23:16.583
I heard many things in Hell.

23:19.975 --> 23:24.975
It is impossible to say how the
idea first entered my brain.

23:26.305 --> 23:29.323
But once conceived,

23:29.325 --> 23:32.668
it haunted me day and night.

23:35.545 --> 23:38.088
Object, there was none.

23:39.445 --> 23:41.165
Passion, there was none.

23:44.345 --> 23:48.263
I lived here, the old man's
room was up the staircase,

23:48.265 --> 23:50.198
mine was close by.

23:51.141 --> 23:55.533
I loved the old man, he
had never wronged me,

23:55.535 --> 23:58.593
he had never given me insult.

23:58.595 --> 24:01.578
For his gold, I had no desire.

24:03.635 --> 24:06.573
I think it was his eye.

24:06.575 --> 24:09.408
Yes, I think it was this.

24:10.685 --> 24:12.678
He had the eye of a vulture,

24:13.615 --> 24:16.188
a pale blue eye with a film over it.

24:17.419 --> 24:21.438
Whenever it fell upon
me, my blood ran cold.

24:24.785 --> 24:29.785
And so by degrees, very
gradually, I made up my mind

24:29.855 --> 24:31.773
to take the life of the old man

24:31.775 --> 24:35.768
and thus rid myself of that eye forever.

24:38.525 --> 24:41.648
Now this is point you'll fancy me mad.

24:42.585 --> 24:44.553
Mad men know nothing.

24:44.555 --> 24:46.873
You should have seen me.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.883
You should have seen
how wisely I proceeded,

24:49.885 --> 24:52.978
and with what caution,
with what foresight,

24:54.045 --> 24:57.193
with what dissimulation I went to work.

24:57.195 --> 25:00.163
I was never kinder to the old man

25:00.165 --> 25:02.515
than during the whole
week before I killed him.

25:33.439 --> 25:37.658
Closed, always closed.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.663
How are you, sir,

25:49.665 --> 25:52.015
and how did you pass the
night, my good friend?

25:53.035 --> 25:57.728
Fine, fine, I thank you.

25:58.846 --> 25:59.899
Good.

26:02.283 --> 26:04.403
Good, good.

26:04.405 --> 26:08.328
No untoward noises to disturb you, then?

26:09.581 --> 26:10.414
No.

26:11.547 --> 26:14.265
No, no.

26:14.267 --> 26:16.017
I thank you.

26:16.933 --> 26:17.766
Uh-huh.

26:26.384 --> 26:29.134
Night eight.

27:32.523 --> 27:33.690
Who's there?

27:37.082 --> 27:40.028
Oh, I know that groan.

27:40.965 --> 27:43.333
It is one of mortal terror,

27:43.335 --> 27:46.410
and it rises from the bottom of the soul.

27:46.412 --> 27:50.108
And now he is telling
himself not to be afraid,

27:51.025 --> 27:54.258
telling himself it is only
the wind in the chimney.

27:55.505 --> 27:59.668
But my friend, it is
death, death approaching.

28:02.613 --> 28:04.196
What do you want?

29:55.126 --> 29:57.103
Sir, one of your neighbors

29:57.105 --> 29:59.883
reported hearing a dreadful
shriek coming from this house,

29:59.885 --> 30:02.020
and we're here to investigate.

30:02.022 --> 30:04.098
A cry, you say?

30:05.865 --> 30:07.588
I'm afraid that was me, Officer.

30:08.945 --> 30:13.203
At times, I have terrible dreams
and I cry out in my sleep.

30:13.205 --> 30:15.673
We heard that there was an
old man lodging here as well.

30:15.675 --> 30:17.703
Oh yes, and my dear friend he is,

30:17.705 --> 30:19.768
but he's away in the
country at the moment.

30:20.875 --> 30:25.038
Why don't you come in, then
you can see for yourself?

30:29.609 --> 30:30.526
Come, come.

31:28.068 --> 31:29.568
The old man's room is up here.

31:35.295 --> 31:39.458
Come in, come in, I want to
show you my friend's room.

31:40.395 --> 31:42.788
Have a seat, sit for a
spell before you leave.

31:44.385 --> 31:46.963
My friend keeps some gold under the bed.

31:53.425 --> 31:54.578
Now you are alone.

31:58.856 --> 32:00.523
Have you lived in the city long?

32:00.525 --> 32:03.833
Yes, well, about three years now.

32:03.835 --> 32:06.903
The city is such an interesting place.

32:06.905 --> 32:09.393
I grew up in the country
and clerk here now.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.943
I moved there
from the country, too.

32:10.945 --> 32:12.755
Oh, well then you know!

32:13.614 --> 32:16.093
It certainly
takes some getting used to,

32:16.095 --> 32:18.053
doesn't it, the city?

32:18.055 --> 32:21.333
It's almost like a living, breathing thing

32:21.335 --> 32:24.173
with the constant beating.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.865
Yes, you do hear it, don't you?

32:34.125 --> 32:36.198
Well, I don't envy you your jobs.

32:38.285 --> 32:42.113
Constantly investigating.

32:42.115 --> 32:45.240
That neighbor, he's always
hearing things, too.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.745
We'll leave you alone now.

32:58.545 --> 33:00.808
Oh, well if you must go.

33:01.715 --> 33:04.488
Thank you for coming,
allow me to show you out.

33:09.797 --> 33:13.193
Oh, you do hear it, don't you?

33:13.195 --> 33:14.228
You must!

33:17.565 --> 33:22.103
Liars, villains, well dissemble
no more, I admit the deed!

33:22.105 --> 33:23.283
I admit it!

33:23.285 --> 33:24.856
It is here, under the planks!

33:24.858 --> 33:28.128
Here is the beating of his hideous heart!

35:35.425 --> 35:38.903
And now for
a little female insanity

35:38.905 --> 35:41.023
and early feminism.

35:41.025 --> 35:43.203
The Yellow Wallpaper was written

35:43.205 --> 35:45.663
by Charlotte Perkins Gilman,

35:45.665 --> 35:48.233
an early pioneer of women's rights

35:48.235 --> 35:53.003
and freedom from the male-dominated world.

35:53.005 --> 35:56.463
Our heroine is keeping a
diary of her confinement

35:56.465 --> 36:00.498
by her doctor husband,
a cold and remote man,

36:01.455 --> 36:06.455
in a room dominated by some
hideous yellow wallpaper,

36:06.635 --> 36:09.143
in the hope that it would cure her

36:09.145 --> 36:12.393
of her apparent emotional issues.

36:12.395 --> 36:17.203
Instead, the woman becomes
completely hypnotized

36:17.205 --> 36:21.955
by the wallpaper and
drifts into total madness.

36:44.975 --> 36:49.083
A colonial
mansion, a haunted house.

36:49.085 --> 36:51.078
Else why would it be let so cheaply?

36:52.515 --> 36:53.993
John laughs at me, of course,

36:53.995 --> 36:56.348
but one expects that in a marriage.

36:57.545 --> 37:00.693
John is a physician, and perhaps,

37:00.695 --> 37:03.268
perhaps that is why I
do not get well faster.

37:04.445 --> 37:08.438
If I had less opposition, and
more society and stimulus.

37:10.685 --> 37:12.658
This house has been empty for years.

37:15.593 --> 37:19.088
There's something strange
about the house, I can feel it.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.503
I don't
like our room one bit.

37:22.505 --> 37:25.603
I wanted one downstairs
that opened onto the piazza,

37:25.605 --> 37:27.278
but John would not hear of it.

37:28.465 --> 37:30.393
He's very careful and loving,

37:30.395 --> 37:33.198
and hardly lets me stir
without special direction.

37:34.095 --> 37:37.838
I was to have perfect rest
and all the air I could get.

37:38.975 --> 37:41.478
So we took the nursery
at the top of the house.

37:42.665 --> 37:46.368
But I never saw worse paper in my life.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.243
We've been here two weeks now

37:56.245 --> 37:59.448
and I haven't felt like writing
before since that first day.

38:00.625 --> 38:03.323
John is away all day and even some nights

38:03.325 --> 38:05.178
when his cases are serious.

38:06.975 --> 38:09.778
I'm glad that my case is not serious,

38:10.825 --> 38:13.808
but these nervous troubles
are dreadfully depressing.

38:15.505 --> 38:17.858
John does not know how I really suffer.

38:19.515 --> 38:22.313
Of course, it's only nervousness.

38:22.315 --> 38:25.013
I suppose John never
was nervous in his life.

38:25.015 --> 38:27.383
Help me out of here.

38:27.385 --> 38:28.683
He laughs at me so

38:28.685 --> 38:30.142
about this wallpaper.

38:33.177 --> 38:36.510
Yes, yes, help.

38:38.459 --> 38:39.818
Yes, help.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.528
Let me out of here.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.913
I used to lie awake as a
child and get more terror

39:06.915 --> 39:11.615
and pleasure out of
blank walls and furniture

39:13.525 --> 39:15.725
than most children could
get in a toy store.

39:17.130 --> 39:18.525
Let me out of here.

39:25.705 --> 39:27.582
- Let me out.
- I can see a

39:28.915 --> 39:31.073
provoking form, and a sort of figure

39:31.075 --> 39:33.453
that seems to skulk about

39:33.455 --> 39:37.088
behind that silly and
provoking front design.

39:39.463 --> 39:41.713
Let me out.

39:42.865 --> 39:44.478
Fourth of July is over.

39:47.465 --> 39:51.243
John says if I do not pick up faster,

39:51.245 --> 39:54.348
he will send me to Dr.
Weir Mitchell in the fall.

39:55.395 --> 39:56.940
Help.

39:56.942 --> 39:58.342
I do not want to go there.

40:02.325 --> 40:05.644
I'm really getting
quite fond of this room.

40:05.646 --> 40:08.223
Let me out of here.

40:08.225 --> 40:10.078
In spite of the wallpaper.

40:13.655 --> 40:15.378
Maybe because of the wallpaper.

40:18.844 --> 40:19.803
Help.

40:19.805 --> 40:22.068
It dwells on my mind so.

40:23.625 --> 40:26.713
I lie here on this immovable bed

40:26.715 --> 40:29.578
and follow that pattern about by the hour.

40:40.505 --> 40:42.513
I don't
know why I should write this,

40:42.515 --> 40:45.823
but I must say what I feel
and think in some way.

40:45.825 --> 40:47.638
It's such a great relief.

40:49.065 --> 40:52.168
It's getting to be a great
effort for me to think straight.

40:53.425 --> 40:55.963
And dear John gathered me up in his arms

40:55.965 --> 40:58.043
and laid me on the bed.

40:58.045 --> 41:00.523
He said I was his darling, all he had,

41:00.525 --> 41:03.983
and that I must take care
of myself for his sake,

41:03.985 --> 41:05.028
and keep well.

41:05.875 --> 41:09.513
He says no one but myself
can help me out of it,

41:09.515 --> 41:11.663
that I must use my will and self control,

41:11.665 --> 41:14.113
and not let silly
fancies run away with me.

41:14.115 --> 41:14.948
Help!

41:18.945 --> 41:21.923
Of course I don't tell him
about the wallpaper anymore.

41:21.925 --> 41:24.168
Oh no, I am too wise.

41:25.505 --> 41:27.958
But I keep watch of it all the same.

41:29.725 --> 41:31.908
And behind those front bars,

41:33.115 --> 41:37.188
that same shape gets clearer every day.

41:39.737 --> 41:42.148
And it's always the same shape.

41:43.135 --> 41:46.557
Help me out of here.

41:46.559 --> 41:50.708
I wish, I wish John would
take me away from here.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.298
There is one marked
peculiarity about this paper.

41:58.665 --> 42:02.873
It changes so quickly that I
never can quite believe it.

42:02.875 --> 42:04.283
Help me to escape.

42:04.285 --> 42:08.701
Worst of all by
moonlight, there are bars.

42:08.703 --> 42:11.613
Let me out of here.

42:11.615 --> 42:12.532
Let me out.

42:13.962 --> 42:14.879
Let me out.

42:21.375 --> 42:25.278
I lie down a great deal,
but I hardly ever sleep.

42:26.185 --> 42:27.998
And that cultivates deceit.

42:29.465 --> 42:31.388
For you see, I do not tell John.

42:33.004 --> 42:36.773
Fact is, I'm getting a
little afraid of John,

42:36.775 --> 42:39.513
he seems so queer sometimes.

42:39.515 --> 42:40.723
I've watched John,

42:40.725 --> 42:44.678
and several times I've caught
him looking at the paper.

42:50.015 --> 42:53.208
I'm feeling so much better now.

42:56.645 --> 43:01.362
I do eat better, and I
am much more quiet now.

43:03.215 --> 43:08.063
John is so pleased to see me improve.

43:08.065 --> 43:10.350
In fact, he laughed a
little the other day,

43:10.352 --> 43:12.473
and said I seemed to be flourishing,

43:12.475 --> 43:15.048
in spite of the wallpaper.

43:19.046 --> 43:22.263
I don't wanna leave now.

43:22.265 --> 43:25.372
There is just a week more, and
I think that will be enough.

43:27.365 --> 43:30.453
I am feeling so much better.

43:30.455 --> 43:31.958
I don't sleep at all.

43:33.381 --> 43:36.618
But it's so interesting
to watch developments.

43:41.038 --> 43:43.278
Let me out of here.

43:49.395 --> 43:52.173
There is
something else about this paper.

43:52.175 --> 43:57.175
The smell, it creeps all over the house.

43:57.205 --> 44:00.033
In this damp weather, it is awful.

44:00.035 --> 44:02.688
I wake up in the night and
find it hanging over me.

44:06.818 --> 44:08.568
Help.

44:10.007 --> 44:11.590
Let me out of here.

44:23.109 --> 44:25.213
- Help me to get out.
- The front pattern moves!

44:25.215 --> 44:29.198
And no wonder, the woman behind shakes it!

44:36.492 --> 44:38.242
Help.

44:39.455 --> 44:40.372
Let me out.

44:52.415 --> 44:56.453
John is so queer now and I
don't want to irritate him.

44:56.455 --> 44:59.393
Besides, I don't want anyone
getting that woman out

44:59.395 --> 45:00.958
of the paper but myself.

45:08.665 --> 45:11.503
If only the top pattern
could be gotten off

45:11.505 --> 45:13.824
from the under one.

45:13.826 --> 45:15.826
Yes, go.

45:16.899 --> 45:20.542
Yes, yes, yes.

45:20.544 --> 45:23.127
Yes, that's it.

45:25.675 --> 45:26.508
Yes.

45:27.717 --> 45:29.134
Help.

45:30.266 --> 45:31.099
Help.

45:32.816 --> 45:33.649
Yes.

45:40.816 --> 45:43.566
Yes, yes.

45:43.568 --> 45:45.651
Yes, yes.

45:46.644 --> 45:48.561
Yes, yes.

46:16.245 --> 46:19.373
I suppose I shall have to
get back behind the paper soon,

46:19.375 --> 46:23.333
but it's so pleasant to be walking

46:23.335 --> 46:26.596
in this great room as I please.

46:30.816 --> 46:33.316
Why, there's John at the door.

46:34.705 --> 46:36.918
How he does call and pound so.

46:40.185 --> 46:42.388
I say in my gentlest voice,

46:43.505 --> 46:46.883
the key is by the front steps.

46:46.885 --> 46:48.288
I threw it out the window.

46:51.355 --> 46:53.978
That silences him for a few moments.

46:55.295 --> 46:58.298
And then he says in his gentlest voice,

46:59.812 --> 47:01.922
"Let me in, my darling."

47:06.011 --> 47:07.425
And then he gets the key.

47:09.745 --> 47:12.438
And of course, he comes in.

47:26.003 --> 47:29.423
And I keep on creeping just the same,

47:29.425 --> 47:32.953
but I look at him over
my shoulder, and I say,

47:32.955 --> 47:35.377
I've got out at last!

47:35.379 --> 47:36.953
And you can't put me back,

47:36.955 --> 47:39.268
because I'm pulling off all the paper!

47:44.808 --> 47:47.298
Now why should that man have fainted?

47:48.132 --> 47:50.613
And right in my path.

47:50.615 --> 47:54.075
Now I shall have to walk
over him every time.

50:11.372 --> 50:15.343
This next
story is a little different.

50:15.345 --> 50:19.863
Was the man mad or just
way ahead of his time?

50:19.865 --> 50:21.713
The Damned Thing was written

50:21.715 --> 50:24.513
by the extraordinary Ambrose Bierce,

50:24.515 --> 50:27.053
veteran of the American Civil War.

50:27.055 --> 50:30.313
Journalist, visionary, who disappeared

50:30.315 --> 50:34.965
while researching the Revolutionary
War in Mexico in 1913.

50:36.455 --> 50:40.213
This is a story of an inquest
into the mysterious death

50:40.215 --> 50:45.215
of a man living a solitary life
in the early American West.

50:45.255 --> 50:49.403
As the jurors gather
round the savaged body,

50:49.405 --> 50:54.405
the question is who, or
what, killed this man?

51:39.291 --> 51:40.958
I don't like this.

52:27.085 --> 52:28.728
It's happening again.

52:29.785 --> 52:33.428
For another entire night,
Buck barked furiously.

52:35.415 --> 52:36.703
Buck!

52:36.705 --> 52:37.536
Buck!

52:37.538 --> 52:39.965
Once
again, I could find nothing.

52:41.125 --> 52:42.118
Has he gone mad?

52:44.445 --> 52:45.795
You smell something, boy?

53:05.595 --> 53:07.283
We have been expecting you.

53:07.285 --> 53:09.503
My apologies for keeping you, Coroner.

53:09.505 --> 53:11.603
I had to post my newspaper and account

53:11.605 --> 53:14.503
of what I suppose I'm
called here to relate.

53:14.505 --> 53:17.503
The account differs, I suspect,

53:17.505 --> 53:20.298
from that which you will
give here, under oath.

53:22.415 --> 53:24.103
That is as you please.

53:24.105 --> 53:26.503
I made a copy of the report I sent.

53:26.505 --> 53:28.933
It was not written as
news, for it is incredible.

53:28.935 --> 53:30.938
Incredible, you say?

53:32.375 --> 53:35.598
That's nothing to you, sir,
if I do also swear it is true.

53:38.025 --> 53:40.418
We will now begin the inquest.

53:42.635 --> 53:45.923
Do you swear to tell the
truth at this hearing,

53:45.925 --> 53:48.183
before these jurors?

53:48.185 --> 53:49.843
I do.

53:49.845 --> 53:52.673
You knew the deceased, Hugh Morgan?

53:52.675 --> 53:53.506
I did.

53:53.508 --> 53:55.153
How did this happen?

53:55.155 --> 53:57.660
Your presence, I mean.

53:58.955 --> 54:00.938
- I
- can stand it no longer.

54:04.735 --> 54:07.508
I have invited Harker to
pass a few weeks with me.

54:08.575 --> 54:09.818
He has a level head.

54:10.845 --> 54:13.878
I can judge by his manner
if he thinks me mad.

54:19.045 --> 54:21.478
I was visiting this
place to hunt and fish.

54:22.765 --> 54:25.253
Part of my purpose was
also to study Morgan

54:25.255 --> 54:28.953
and his odd, solitary way of life.

54:28.955 --> 54:30.243
I thought he might make a good model

54:30.245 --> 54:32.093
for a character in fiction.

54:32.095 --> 54:34.033
I sometimes write stories.

54:34.035 --> 54:35.843
I sometimes read them.

54:35.845 --> 54:37.333
Thank you.

54:37.335 --> 54:39.608
Stories in general, not yours.

54:44.415 --> 54:48.103
Relate the circumstances
of this man's death.

54:48.105 --> 54:51.509
You may use any notes or
memoranda as you please.

54:52.535 --> 54:56.043
It was just after dawn
when we departed the cabin.

54:56.045 --> 54:57.395
We were hunting for grouse.

55:05.759 --> 55:07.553
We've startled a deer!

55:07.555 --> 55:09.098
I wish I'd brought a rifle.

55:14.325 --> 55:15.903
Come now, you're not gonna fill up a deer

55:15.905 --> 55:17.068
with birdshot, are you?

55:18.680 --> 55:20.258
What is it, then, bear?

55:22.285 --> 55:23.378
What the devil is it?

55:24.640 --> 55:26.605
That damned thing.

55:54.145 --> 55:57.483
Before I could get to my
feet and reach for my gun,

55:57.485 --> 55:59.585
I heard Morgan crying out in mortal agony.

56:05.205 --> 56:09.188
I had a vague belief that
he was suffering from a fit,

56:10.145 --> 56:11.345
some kind of convulsion.

56:21.885 --> 56:24.178
May Heaven spare me
another sight like that.

56:25.858 --> 56:28.058
When I reached his side, he was down.

56:29.754 --> 56:30.921
Oh, my friend.

56:34.674 --> 56:35.591
He is dead.

56:40.325 --> 56:43.868
A fantastic story indeed.

56:45.095 --> 56:49.482
Are we to believe the
morning air caused this?

56:53.775 --> 56:55.618
An animal of some kind.

57:01.625 --> 57:04.418
But you did not see anything attack him.

57:05.955 --> 57:06.788
No.

57:13.235 --> 57:15.966
These were found on the deceased.

57:15.968 --> 57:18.888
Morgan did love his spirits.

57:21.175 --> 57:24.798
Gentlemen, we have no more evidence.

57:26.025 --> 57:28.503
Your duty has been explained to you.

57:28.505 --> 57:30.033
If you have nothing to ask,

57:30.035 --> 57:32.908
you may go outside and
consider your verdict.

57:38.175 --> 57:43.175
Do not leave town until
this inquiry is complete.

57:47.795 --> 57:50.793
The book you have there.

57:50.795 --> 57:52.578
That's Morgan's diary, is it not?

57:53.715 --> 57:55.313
You seemed greatly interested in it

57:55.315 --> 57:56.865
when I was giving my testimony.

57:57.785 --> 57:59.403
May I see it?

57:59.405 --> 58:00.871
The public might be greatly interested...

58:00.873 --> 58:03.499
The book will have no
matter in this inquest.

58:17.845 --> 58:19.873
For
another entire night,

58:19.875 --> 58:21.528
Buck barked furiously.

58:27.485 --> 58:28.935
It has been about here again.

58:34.445 --> 58:36.948
I find evidence of its presence every day.

58:39.685 --> 58:43.128
I watched again all night
last night, in the same cover.

58:44.765 --> 58:45.688
It is terrible.

58:46.658 --> 58:47.968
Unsupportable.

58:49.445 --> 58:53.078
If these amazing experiences
are real, I shall go mad.

58:54.465 --> 58:57.848
If they are fanciful, I have already.

59:04.132 --> 59:05.965
I shall not go away!

59:07.777 --> 59:09.248
You shall not drive me away!

59:11.705 --> 59:14.485
This is my house, my land!

59:16.505 --> 59:18.218
God hates a coward!

59:41.095 --> 59:45.903
We the jury do find the
remains come to their end

59:45.905 --> 59:49.173
at the hands of a mountain lion.

59:49.175 --> 59:53.328
Yet some of us think, all
the same, he had fits.

59:58.645 --> 01:00:00.919
I have
the solution of the mystery.

01:00:05.695 --> 01:00:06.868
It came to me tonight.

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:09.998
Suddenly, by revelation.

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:18.448
How simple.

01:00:21.729 --> 01:00:22.928
How terribly simple.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.190
There are sounds we humans cannot hear.

01:00:30.505 --> 01:00:34.413
A flock of birds in full song,
in several different trees,

01:00:34.415 --> 01:00:36.183
will suddenly, at the same instant,

01:00:36.185 --> 01:00:38.723
fly up into the air and away.

01:00:38.725 --> 01:00:39.558
Together.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:42.323
There must have been some sound,

01:00:42.325 --> 01:00:44.998
a warning that they could hear,

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.588
but unheard by me or
any other human being.

01:00:52.725 --> 01:00:55.053
And whales, it is well known to seamen

01:00:55.055 --> 01:00:58.093
that whales can be basking, playing,

01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:00.543
and then suddenly, the same instant,

01:01:00.545 --> 01:01:02.978
dive all out of sight in a moment,

01:01:04.275 --> 01:01:07.898
alerted by a sound too great
for the ear of a seaman.

01:01:11.715 --> 01:01:15.258
As it is with sounds, so
it must be with colors.

01:01:18.665 --> 01:01:19.498
I'm not mad.

01:01:21.435 --> 01:01:23.068
There are colors we cannot see.

01:01:24.505 --> 01:01:28.158
And God help me, that damned
thing is of such a color.

01:01:32.325 --> 01:01:34.948
Damned thing is of such a color.

01:01:42.075 --> 01:01:44.158
Simply the madness of solitude.

01:01:45.865 --> 01:01:47.822
That madness dies with Morgan.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:07.848
Hello?

01:02:22.035 --> 01:02:23.319
Anybody there?

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:47.676
