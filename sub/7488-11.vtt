00:14.720 --> 00:17.850
Little early for ice
cream, isn't it?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.610
What are you doing
here, officer?

00:19.650 --> 00:21.026
Somebody triggered
the silent alarm.

00:21.050 --> 00:24.720
Really? I didn't hear anything.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.050
- What's with your face?
- Well, some people say

00:27.090 --> 00:28.990
I have my mom's eyes
and my dad's nose,

00:29.020 --> 00:30.990
But I see more of
my great aunt Ruth.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.960
She is a <i>handsome</i> woman.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.030
I'm talking about the starfish.

00:36.060 --> 00:39.060
I have a starfish on my face.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.640
- Freeze, ice-cream stealers.
- What's going on?

00:44.670 --> 00:46.810
He's busting us for breaking
into the ice cream shop.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.810
Officer, this is a misunderstanding.
I work here.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.710
No, you don't. You served me a latte
yesterday at the coffee kiosk.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.010
Yeah, I get fired a lot.

00:56.040 --> 00:59.750
I can see why. That was the worst
latte I ever had in my life.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.920
Why are you in pajamas and
why is he covered in sand

01:03.950 --> 01:06.020
Officer, I know this looks bad,

01:06.060 --> 01:09.020
But I swear we're not robbing
the ice cream store.

01:09.060 --> 01:13.660
Score! I can't believe
we pulled this off.

01:15.730 --> 01:17.940
All right, kids, come on.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.840
Let's take a little
ride downtown.

01:19.870 --> 01:23.610
But we can't. I'm performing
at the miami beach bash today.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.840
The miami beach bash? Why
didn't you say something?

01:26.880 --> 01:28.810
-I'll let you off right n.
-Really?

01:28.850 --> 01:30.750
No. Let's go.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.690
<i>When the crowd wants more</i>

01:37.720 --> 01:38.920
<i>I bring on the thunder</i>

01:38.960 --> 01:40.720
<i>'cause you've got my back</i>

01:40.760 --> 01:41.960
<i>and I'm not going under</i>

01:41.990 --> 01:43.730
<i>you're my point, you're my guard</i>

01:43.760 --> 01:45.000
<i>you're the perfect chord</i>

01:45.030 --> 01:48.030
<i>and I see our names
together on every billboard</i>

01:48.070 --> 01:51.100
<i>we're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock</i>

01:51.140 --> 01:52.870
<i>we'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

01:52.910 --> 01:55.040
<i>and we'll keep rockin'</i>

01:55.070 --> 01:59.680
<i>oh, there's no way I
could make it without ya</i>

01:59.710 --> 02:02.710
<i>do it without ya,
be here without ya</i>

02:02.750 --> 02:05.750
<i>it's no fun when
you're doing it solo</i>

02:05.780 --> 02:08.750
<i>with you it's like,
"whoa," yeah, and I know</i>

02:08.789 --> 02:11.760
<i>I own this dream</i>

02:17.890 --> 02:21.029

Austin & Ally S01E11
Songwriting & Starfish

02:26.940 --> 02:29.740
I swear we weren't
committing a crime, officer.

02:29.770 --> 02:32.910
We were trying to finish a song for
Austin to perform at the beach bash.

02:32.940 --> 02:36.610
Yeah. Fm 109's having a
hot summer jam contest.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.680
If I win, I get my
song on the radio.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.790
Kid, you just got
sand all in my latte.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.760
That's still better

02:46.790 --> 02:48.190
Than the one she
made me yesterday.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.630
Anyway, the song's
the whole reason

02:53.660 --> 02:54.860
We were in the ice cream shop.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.700
So you expect me to believe
that you were in a ski mask,

02:57.730 --> 02:59.900
You're covered in sand,
you're in pajamas

02:59.940 --> 03:02.670
<i>And you have a
starfish on your face</i>

03:02.710 --> 03:04.870
All because of a song?

03:04.910 --> 03:08.650
I know it sounds crazy, but it's all
part of our songwriting process.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.680
It's a long story.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.650
A story. I love a story.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.020
Tell me everything.

03:16.050 --> 03:18.890
<i>I was trying to come with
something for the beach bash</i>

03:18.920 --> 03:20.790
<i>And I finally got an idea.</i>

03:20.830 --> 03:23.606
Nobody talk to me. I have a melody in
my head and I don't wanna lose it.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.936
Nobody talk to me either.
No reason.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.880
I just don't feel like
talking to either of you.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.900
Excuse me.

03:29.930 --> 03:31.700
Can I borrow the
piano for a second?

03:33.900 --> 03:36.040
No no no, I'm gonna
lose the melody!

03:36.070 --> 03:39.640
Here, let me help you.
Did it sound like this?

03:39.680 --> 03:42.780
Dez, stop, you're not helping.

03:42.810 --> 03:46.620
Did it sound like this?

03:49.750 --> 03:51.050
Neither of you are helping!

03:51.090 --> 03:53.620
Hey, when did you
guys get cowbells?

04:12.810 --> 04:14.780
That's it. That's the melody.

04:14.810 --> 04:16.779
Now let's put some
chords behind it.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.830
So what do you think?

04:29.860 --> 04:31.970
It's a good song, ally.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.770
It's just... you wrote
it in a minor key.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.000
It's so sad.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.810
Sad sad sad.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.010
It should be in a major key...
upbeat and happy.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.850
Fun fun fun fun-fun!

04:53.690 --> 04:55.790
-fun fun fun fun-fun!
-I like that.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.660
Now this could be
a hot summer jam.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.600
That is jamming.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.640
Jam on it.

05:09.670 --> 05:10.970
Jammy-jam-jam.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.640
Jam and cheese sandwich.

05:15.010 --> 05:18.080
-One too many? -All too many.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.020
Now we just need to think
up some sweet lyrics

05:23.050 --> 05:24.980
About how awesome the beach is.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.950
Let me give it a shot.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.830
Sand in my eyes, sun
burning my thighs

05:32.860 --> 05:34.730
waves crash on piles of trash

05:34.760 --> 05:37.030
we're at the beach, hurray.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.670
Ally, those lyrics
are a total bummer.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.070
I said "hurray."

05:44.100 --> 05:45.800
I'm sorry, austin.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.909
I've just always had bad
experiences at the beach.

05:47.910 --> 05:50.310
You know who else is gonna have
bad experiences at the beach

05:50.740 --> 05:53.940
Me. We're not gonna win that
hot summer jam contest,

05:53.980 --> 05:55.750
'cause we don't have a song.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.080
Your story's just not adding up.

06:07.110 --> 06:09.780
You said you were in the ice
cream shop to write a song,

06:09.820 --> 06:11.850
And now you're saying you
didn't have any lyrics.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.920
No, you kids aren't
going anywhere.

06:13.950 --> 06:15.750
Get comfortable.

06:15.790 --> 06:18.760
<i>Way</i> ahead of ya.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.060
Uh, excuse me, officer,

06:20.090 --> 06:22.090
But aren't we allowed
to call someone?

06:22.130 --> 06:25.700
You get one phone call.
Make it count.

06:25.730 --> 06:28.100
-Yes! -Oh, I will.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.700
Hi, mom.

06:34.740 --> 06:36.800
I just called to say I love you.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.670
Goodbye.

06:40.910 --> 06:42.940
You just wasted our
one phone call!

06:42.980 --> 06:45.220
Whoa, it is never a waste to
tell someone you love them!

06:46.820 --> 06:48.150
Okay.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.850
I'm gonna go see if your
jail cells are ready.

06:50.890 --> 06:53.150
- What? -Officer, wait,
let us finish the story.

06:53.190 --> 06:56.120
It gets better...
ally got in a fight.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.930
Ooh, a fight.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.076
Grab some napkins, 'cause
this story's getting juicy.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.730
Who'd you fight?

07:02.770 --> 07:03.970
A beach chair.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.740
Don't tell me the
beach chair won.

07:06.770 --> 07:09.000
What? Of course not.

07:09.040 --> 07:12.010
Look at these guns.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.790
<i>We knew ally only
wrote bad lyrics</i>

07:22.820 --> 07:24.790
<i>'cause she never had a
good time at the beach,</i>

07:24.820 --> 07:27.660
<i>So we thought we'd show her
how to have fun there .</i>

07:27.690 --> 07:30.030
This is so not fun!

07:30.060 --> 07:32.130
Trish!

07:32.160 --> 07:34.030
Right.

07:34.070 --> 07:37.040
I love pushing a heavy
cart through the sand

07:37.070 --> 07:39.100
In the hot sun for minimum wage.

07:39.140 --> 07:40.970
Hurray beach!

07:42.010 --> 07:44.140
I said "hurray."

07:44.180 --> 07:46.680
Guys, I appreciate
what you're doing,

07:46.710 --> 07:48.810
But maybe I'm just
not a beach person.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.880
I mean, you see the
sun, I see sunburn.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.020
You see ocean, I see
place where sharks live.

07:55.050 --> 07:57.090
You're focused on
the wrong things.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.090
There's so much cool stuff here.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.090
Look, people rocking
their shades,

08:02.130 --> 08:04.030
Kids smiling and tanning,

08:04.060 --> 08:07.670
Dez with a starfish on his face.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.740
You guys, the water is <i>amazing.</i>

08:11.770 --> 08:13.970
Dez, you've got a little
something on your-

08:14.010 --> 08:16.880
Oh. Thanks.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.010
No, you've got a
starfish on your face

08:20.680 --> 08:22.950
Oh, man, it's gonna hurt
when I pull it off.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.980
-Ooh, I'll do it! -I got it.

08:25.020 --> 08:27.120
I'll do it quick, on three.
One...

08:29.890 --> 08:31.120
Two, three.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.830
I'm gonna keep him. We've
been through a lot together.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.130
Uh, you know what, austin?

08:42.169 --> 08:45.800
You're right. There is some cool
stuff here we can use in the lyrics.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.770
Smiling and tanning,
rocking the shades,

08:48.810 --> 08:50.740
I'm gonna write that down.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.050
Ugh. Oh no.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.080
This gum melted and got
all over my songbook.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.890
Oh no, the song book closed
and got all over my gum.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.960
You see?

09:04.990 --> 09:06.830
Bad things happen at the beach.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.930
Relax, I can fix it.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.130
May I please touch your
book just this once?

09:13.670 --> 09:15.700
Wh... ooh, what are you doing?

09:15.740 --> 09:18.770
There. The gum will freeze and
then we can scrape it off.

09:18.810 --> 09:22.680
Just don't accidentally give it to
someone when you sell them ice cream.

09:22.710 --> 09:26.880
Oh, that's adorable. You think
I'm actually gonna work.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.720
Guess who's ready to tan.

09:32.750 --> 09:33.950
I'm with trish.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.690
Let's catch some rays while
we think of more lyrics.

09:36.730 --> 09:38.660
Yo, dez, toss me the sunblock.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.130
Okay, so we're chilling.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.900
I can do that.

09:44.930 --> 09:48.130
I'll just sit back
and relax and...

09:50.140 --> 09:52.810
Why does this chair hate me?

09:52.840 --> 09:55.070
Here, let me help you.

10:05.180 --> 10:07.690
What? Wh...

10:07.720 --> 10:10.060
Why is this sand so sticky?

10:10.090 --> 10:12.930
Yeah, this isn't sunblock.
It's glue.

10:14.060 --> 10:16.930
What?! Why'd you bring
glue to the beach?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.170
How else are you supposed
to stay up on a surfboard?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.840
Um, guys?

10:24.870 --> 10:27.780
A little help.

10:32.180 --> 10:35.150
All right. Well, that explains
how you got the lyrics

10:35.190 --> 10:38.090
And why he's covered in sand,
but why does this fool

10:38.120 --> 10:40.990
Still have a starfish on his face
if you ripped the other one off?

10:41.020 --> 10:44.160
Wait. Don't tell me you got
another one stuck to your face.

10:44.190 --> 10:46.060
No, I'm not an idiot.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.930
I got the same starfish
stuck to my face.

10:50.030 --> 10:51.870
But I still don't
understand how you guys

10:51.900 --> 10:54.800
- All ended in the ice cream shop.
- Well, we had the verses,

10:54.840 --> 10:56.116
But we couldn't figure
out a cool chorus.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.970
So we had to pull an all-nighter
to finish the song.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.110
Okay, wait. What about this?

11:02.140 --> 11:04.750
Summer at the beach

11:04.780 --> 11:06.910
rocking shades

11:06.950 --> 11:09.950
bed, pillow, tired, dreams.

11:12.050 --> 11:14.850
-ally! -Did we finish the song?

11:14.890 --> 11:18.120
No, but you slobbered
all over the keys.

11:20.030 --> 11:23.060
Why are we having such a hard time
coming up with lyrics for the chorus?

11:24.770 --> 11:27.030
Maybe I have some old
ideas in my songbook.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.810
Oh no, I left my book in
trish's ice cream cart.

11:37.850 --> 11:40.110
-I'm calling her.
-Are you kidding?

11:40.150 --> 11:42.180
It's 4:00 a.M. Trish is asleep.

11:42.220 --> 11:46.050
Austin, please. Trish
is my best friend.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.760
She'll understand.

11:48.790 --> 11:51.160
I don't understand!
It's 4:00 a.M.!

11:51.190 --> 11:53.830
Why would you do this to me?!

11:53.860 --> 11:56.730
I-I... I'm sorry, trish, but
my book is in your cart.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.770
We need your keys to get inside
so we can finish the song.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.740
Oh no, I forgot my keys.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.140
Trish! But... my book!

12:07.740 --> 12:10.080
-It's unlocked. -Oh yeah.

12:10.110 --> 12:13.010
I keep it unlocked because
I always forget my keys.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.720
"no hugging the ice cream"?

12:24.760 --> 12:27.090
Do they really need
a sign for that?

12:27.130 --> 12:29.860
You'd be surprised at
how often it happens.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.900
I love you, ice cream.

12:31.930 --> 12:33.830
Austin!

12:35.040 --> 12:36.870
Sorry.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.840
Let's just grab your book
and get out of here.

12:38.870 --> 12:40.070
Yeah.

12:43.910 --> 12:46.080
Uh, guys? I think the
door handle broke.

12:46.110 --> 12:47.210
-What?! -Oh no!

12:51.950 --> 12:54.920
- We're trapped in here!
- This is all my fault.

12:54.950 --> 12:57.760
No, it's not. You didn't
do it on purpose.

12:57.790 --> 13:00.190
No, when I was five I
made a birthday wish

13:00.230 --> 13:02.800
That I'd be locked in a
freezer full of ice cream.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.830
I should've wished for a pony.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.430
What are we gonna do?
It's freezing in here.

13:17.470 --> 13:19.430
And the beach bash
is in a few hours

13:19.470 --> 13:21.440
And we haven't even
finished our song.

13:21.470 --> 13:23.500
-I'll call dez. -Yeah.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.750
Hello?

13:33.780 --> 13:35.720
Oh man!

13:35.750 --> 13:38.780
Why did I put my starfish next
to my starfish phone again?

13:42.820 --> 13:44.560
Hello?

13:44.590 --> 13:46.530
Dez, we're in the
ice cream shop,

13:46.560 --> 13:48.660
-Locked in the freezer. -<i>Austin?</i>

13:48.690 --> 13:50.700
Austin, it's a bad connection.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.500
Did you say you're
at a me dream swap

13:52.530 --> 13:54.570
-And your clock is a sneezer?
-<i>What?</i>

13:54.600 --> 13:57.570
No, come to the ice cream shop!

13:57.610 --> 13:59.570
We need you to save us!

13:59.610 --> 14:02.580
I have to come to the ice
cream shop and shave gus?

14:03.580 --> 14:04.780
I'm on my way.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.750
Dez? Dez?

14:10.690 --> 14:12.650
Well, I think he's on his way,

14:12.690 --> 14:16.460
But he might be stopping to
shave some guy named gus.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.560
I hope dez gets here soon.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.699
I'm freezing.

14:21.700 --> 14:23.660
Oh, here, put on this ski mask.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.730
Wh... why do you have
a ski mask in here?

14:26.770 --> 14:30.540
So I don't freeze my face off when
I sneak in here to take naps.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.780
Man, I'm starting to get hungry, but
all that's in here is ice cream.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.910
Wait. All that's in
here is ice cream!

14:42.850 --> 14:45.590
Mmm, chocolate chip!

14:48.620 --> 14:50.820
Mm, cookie dough.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.500
Oh, fruity mint swirl!

14:57.570 --> 14:58.800
Fruity mint swirl?

14:58.830 --> 15:01.700
That was my favorite ice cream
when I was a little girl.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.610
Guys, we can't have ice
cream for breakfast...

15:08.640 --> 15:11.680
Without toppings!

15:13.880 --> 15:16.650
Fruity mint swirl reminds
me of this one time

15:16.680 --> 15:17.826
When I was on the
beach with my dad.

15:17.850 --> 15:20.790
We were walking on the boardwalk
eating this ice cream.

15:20.820 --> 15:24.620
Wait, are you having a good
memory about the beach?

15:24.660 --> 15:27.700
Mmm, I guess I am.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.800
I'm having a good memory too.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.770
Remember that time, right now,

15:31.800 --> 15:34.540
When I was ignoring your story
and eating this ice cream?

15:34.570 --> 15:35.800
Oh, good times, good times.

15:36.910 --> 15:40.440
Anyway, while we were
eating the ice cream,

15:40.480 --> 15:42.710
We heard this cool
song on the radio.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.650
The band was playing
in town that night,

15:44.680 --> 15:46.810
So my dad took me
down to see the show.

15:46.850 --> 15:50.680
We had the best time ever.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.750
Hey, maybe there's
something in that memory

15:52.790 --> 15:54.590
We could use for the chorus.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.690
Yeah, "heard it on the radio,

15:58.730 --> 16:01.560
Coming down to see the show."

16:01.600 --> 16:02.760
That's perfect.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.730
Heard it on the radio...

16:04.770 --> 16:06.700
coming down to see your show.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.800
We have a song for
the beach bash!

16:08.840 --> 16:11.710
We're still stuck
in the freezer.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.710
Hey, guys.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.710
Sorry I didn't get here quicker.

16:18.750 --> 16:22.620
It's taking twice as long as I
thought to shave gus the janitor.

16:24.420 --> 16:26.620
Smooth like half
a baby's bottom.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.500
And that's why we were
in the ice cream shop.

16:33.530 --> 16:35.600
Do you believe our
story now, officer?

16:35.630 --> 16:38.500
You know what? I do.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.670
-Yes! -So you'll let us go?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.470
-No. -What?!

16:42.510 --> 16:44.586
Well, you just admitted to
breaking into the ice cream shop

16:44.610 --> 16:46.840
And stealing fruity mint swirl.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.740
Forget about the beach bash.

16:48.780 --> 16:50.680
You kids aren't going anywhere.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.850
I can't believe we're
gonna miss the beach bash

16:55.890 --> 16:58.490
After all we went through
writing that song.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.720
That song will still
be the hot summer jam,

17:00.760 --> 17:04.690
Even if I have to sing it personally to
all the men, women and children in miami.

17:04.730 --> 17:07.560
I heard it on the radio,
coming down to see the show!

17:07.599 --> 17:09.569
Heard it on the radio...

17:09.599 --> 17:11.730
thank you.

17:11.770 --> 17:13.650
I thought I was gonna
have to pepper-spray him.

17:15.670 --> 17:18.640
You still can.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.540
No, I shouldn't.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.520
Austin, check it out.

17:36.860 --> 17:40.430
Sorry... sorry about that. I get...
I get carried away.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.430
- "breaking"... that's okay.
You're good.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.700
No no, I don't know if I'm good.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.470
Really? You think I'm good.

17:47.510 --> 17:49.586
'cause when I was in a kid, I
always wanted to be in a band,

17:49.610 --> 17:52.480
But my dad said I had a
bazillion-in-one chance

17:52.510 --> 17:53.726
In make it in the
music biz, so...

17:53.750 --> 17:55.580
So I quit.

17:55.610 --> 17:58.410
It's too bad I'm not
playing the beach bash

17:58.450 --> 17:59.756
Or I'd ask you to sit
in with my band.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.850
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

18:01.890 --> 18:04.890
You two could totally be
jamming on stage together

18:04.920 --> 18:06.590
In two hours, but...

18:06.620 --> 18:08.590
Ah... we're stuck in here.

18:10.530 --> 18:12.460
Really? 'cause I have
some drumsticks back...

18:13.500 --> 18:15.360
Wait a sec.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.776
I know what it is
you're trying to do.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.670
You think I'm gonna
let you outta here

18:18.700 --> 18:21.610
And go to the beach bash,
just so I can play drums

18:21.640 --> 18:23.770
And finally prove my dad wrong.
That's...

18:23.810 --> 18:27.650
In your face, dad! I'm drum!

18:33.890 --> 18:35.590
What's up, miami?!

18:38.890 --> 18:40.730
This is a new song my
partner ally and I wrote

18:40.760 --> 18:42.460
Called "heard it on the radio."

18:42.490 --> 18:45.530
I hope everybody likes it.
Hit it, officer.

18:48.630 --> 18:51.600
Yo, whassup?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.800
Summer in the sand, he's
the drummer in the band

18:53.840 --> 18:55.786
dropping the beat, she's the d.J.
At the boardwalk

18:55.810 --> 18:58.610
a smile and a tan, and
her sandals in her hand

18:58.640 --> 19:00.786
rocking her shades, you could
almost see their eyes lock

19:00.810 --> 19:02.850
what could be better than
a party in the weather

19:02.880 --> 19:05.580
with the both of us
together in the backdrop?

19:05.620 --> 19:07.690
Everything s right and the
day turned into night

19:07.720 --> 19:10.620
with the music and the lights,
that's when we stopped, stop stop

19:12.490 --> 19:15.390
heard it on the radio,
sing it out loud

19:17.400 --> 19:19.360
coming down to see your show

19:19.400 --> 19:21.700
oh oh oh, having fun now

19:21.730 --> 19:24.500
heard it on the radio, oh oh

19:24.540 --> 19:26.470
oh oh oh, having fun now

19:26.500 --> 19:28.670
coming down to see your show!

19:30.570 --> 19:34.710
Whoa! Okay. listen the
story about this party

19:34.750 --> 19:37.610
about the glory, about the
summer that would raise the bar

19:37.650 --> 19:39.820
anyone would tell you it
was chill, it was stellar

19:39.850 --> 19:42.620
the best time we had so far

19:42.650 --> 19:44.660
everyone together, always
going, never better

19:44.690 --> 19:46.790
and the good times
go on and on and on

19:46.830 --> 19:49.430
never will forget it, doesn't
matter where we're headed

19:49.460 --> 19:51.660
I'll remember when I
hear our song, what?

19:53.500 --> 19:56.700
Heard it on the radio,
sing it out loud

19:58.540 --> 20:00.470
oh oh, coming down
to see your show

20:00.510 --> 20:03.580
oh oh oh, having fun now

20:03.610 --> 20:05.710
heard it on the radio, oh oh

20:05.750 --> 20:07.680
oh oh oh, having fun now

20:07.710 --> 20:10.420
heard it on the radio, oh oh

20:10.450 --> 20:12.620
oh oh oh, having fun now

20:12.650 --> 20:14.490
coming down to see your show!

20:30.470 --> 20:32.700
Thanks for letting me
play with you, austin.

20:32.740 --> 20:35.840
That was awesome! Told you, dad!
Unh!

20:35.880 --> 20:39.580
So are we free to go, officer?

20:40.680 --> 20:42.750
Yeah.

20:42.780 --> 20:44.620
I spoke to the owner
of the ice cream shop

20:44.650 --> 20:46.796
And he said that since ally
left money for the ice cream,

20:46.820 --> 20:48.620
He's not pressing charges.

20:48.660 --> 20:51.820
You being a goody-goody
finally paid off.

20:51.860 --> 20:54.690
Honey is its own reward.

20:54.730 --> 20:56.760
She just doesn't stop.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.900
Hey, don't give ally
all the credit.

20:58.930 --> 21:01.630
We probably got off
because my boss loves me.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.900
Actually, he wanted me to
tell you that you're fired.

21:03.940 --> 21:06.700
What? But we didn't break in!

21:06.740 --> 21:08.710
It wasn't for that. It was for...
ooh...

21:08.740 --> 21:11.840
"leaving the shop unlocked,
napping in the freezer,

21:11.880 --> 21:13.710
Charging for free samples,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.510
Scooping ice cream
with your hands,

21:15.550 --> 21:16.886
Scooping ice cream with
someone else's hands."

21:16.910 --> 21:18.650
Okay, I get it. I'm fired.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.620
On a totally unrelated note,

21:21.650 --> 21:23.620
Are you guys hiring
down at the station?

21:23.650 --> 21:26.490
- How are you with paperwork?
- Mmm, see, I really don't do

21:26.520 --> 21:28.530
Anything with the
word "work" in it.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.660
- Can you start Monday?
- Mmm, I also don't work

21:30.700 --> 21:32.760
On days that end with "y."

21:32.800 --> 21:34.700
<i>oh oh oh, having fun now</i>

21:34.730 --> 21:37.440
<i>heard it on the radio, oh oh</i>

21:37.470 --> 21:40.770
<i>oh oh oh, having fun now,

21:40.810 --> 21:43.680
<i>That was austin moon with
"heard it on the dio,"</i>

21:43.710 --> 21:46.480
<i>The winner of fm 109 hot
summer jam contest.</i>

21:49.550 --> 21:51.450
<i>-oh, I can't believe it...</i>

21:51.480 --> 21:52.780
Our first song on the radio.

21:52.820 --> 21:55.490
I always dreamed of this day.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.860
This is awesome. I
think now I know

21:57.890 --> 22:00.660
What was missing all those times
I didn't have fun at the beach.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.790
We know, we know...
your good friends.

22:02.830 --> 22:05.860
No, my best friend

22:07.530 --> 22:09.570
I love you, fruity mint swirl

22:11.540 --> 22:14.470
I am so psyched you got
a song on the radio.

22:14.510 --> 22:15.510
Group hug!

22:19.700 --> 22:21.500
- Dez -Yeah

22:22.000 --> 22:23.880
You weren't just putting
on sunblock, were you?

22:24.000 --> 22:24.800
Yeah, why

22:25.000 --> 22:27.240
It wasn't sunblock, it was glue
