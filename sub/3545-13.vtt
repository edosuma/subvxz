00:00.166 --> 00:01.959
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.041 --> 00:05.792
- Were you with a woman?
- You said you'd hate him forever.

00:05.875 --> 00:08.959
Don't listen to a woman
who's had her heart broken.

00:09.041 --> 00:10.291
<i>Ending a relationship...</i>

00:10.375 --> 00:14.291
- I want to be with you.
- I don't think that would be wise.

00:14.375 --> 00:17.625
<i>- ...can be very hard.</i>
- I was sleeping with your son.

00:17.709 --> 00:20.750
- But it's over now.
<i>- Keeping secrets...</i>

00:20.875 --> 00:23.291
- It's not over.
<i>- ...is even harder.</i>

00:23.375 --> 00:28.959
- I don't understand what you're saying.
- I killed my baby sister.

00:37.333 --> 00:40.250
I want the toys picked up.

00:40.417 --> 00:43.000
Pick up your toys.
You want a spanking?

00:43.083 --> 00:47.959
<i>There is a look</i>
<i>the parents of well-behaved children</i>

00:48.083 --> 00:51.125
<i>give to the parents</i>
<i>of the not so well-behaved.</i>

00:51.208 --> 00:54.959
Don't look at me like that.
I will wipe that smirk off your face.

00:55.083 --> 00:58.250
<i>It's a look that says</i>
<i>"Control your kids".</i>

00:58.333 --> 01:00.834
We're just gonna clean the yard...

01:00.917 --> 01:04.750
<i>"After all,</i>
<i>they're your responsibility".</i>

01:07.959 --> 01:10.417
Hey, I'm not fooling.

01:10.500 --> 01:16.041
<i>It was easy for Susan</i>
<i>to feel smug with a daughter like Julie.</i>

01:16.750 --> 01:20.625
<i>- She brought home straight As.</i>
- Oh! You did it again!

01:21.458 --> 01:24.166
<i>She was helpful around the house.</i>

01:26.667 --> 01:32.417
<i>She was bright, affectionate</i>
<i>and considerate of others.</i>

01:32.959 --> 01:37.291
<i>To her mother's way of thinking,</i>
<i>Julie was the perfect child.</i>

01:37.375 --> 01:43.000
<i>Unfortunately, Susan was about to</i>
<i>discover that no such creature existed.</i>

01:47.166 --> 01:48.375
Mom!

01:48.458 --> 01:51.291
Were you just kissing my daughter?

01:52.458 --> 01:55.166
- A little.
- What are you thinking?

01:55.291 --> 01:57.583
- Mom, calm down.
- She's 14!

01:57.667 --> 02:00.667
I should...
I should probably be going.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.917
Ya think?

02:04.166 --> 02:05.750
Just...

02:05.834 --> 02:10.125
- See you Friday.
- What's happening on Friday?

02:10.208 --> 02:13.875
- He's taking me to the school dance.
- No, he's not.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.375
Mom, I know you saw us kissing,
but you've got to chill now.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.166
I have no intentions of chilling.

02:20.291 --> 02:22.750
Whatever.
I'm taking out the trash.

02:22.834 --> 02:26.250
- You will talk about this.
- Not while you're freaking out.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.417
You will not see him anymore.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.583
<i>There is also a look</i>

02:30.709 --> 02:35.291
<i>the parents of not-so-well behaved</i>
<i>children give to parents like Susan.</i>

02:35.375 --> 02:39.834
<i>It says, "Welcome to the club".</i>

03:21.500 --> 03:24.959
<i>Suburbia is a place</i>
<i>filled with responsible people</i>

03:25.041 --> 03:28.041
<i>trying to live responsible lives.</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:32.959
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>even the most responsible among us</i>

03:33.083 --> 03:35.166
<i>has mistakes in their past.</i>

03:38.875 --> 03:41.792
<i>Mistakes they'd like to forget.</i>

03:45.792 --> 03:50.792
<i>Mistakes that sometimes</i>
<i>come back to haunt them.</i>

03:50.917 --> 03:53.333
I'm gonna go get the mail.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.917
Helen.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't believe
you've met my husband. Bob.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.834
Hi. So nice to meet you...

04:08.208 --> 04:11.291
We came to talk to you
about our son.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.500
I haven't seen John in weeks.

04:13.625 --> 04:17.750
He's left messages, but I haven't
returned any. It's over. I swear.

04:17.834 --> 04:21.834
We're not here about that.
We need you to do something for us.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.000
OK...

04:23.083 --> 04:27.333
John announced he was turning down
his college scholarship.

04:27.458 --> 04:32.542
Instead he's decided to expand his
gardening business. Mow lawns full time.

04:33.375 --> 04:36.083
Why would he do that?

04:36.208 --> 04:40.041
We don't know. Do you think
we'd be talking to you if we did?

04:40.125 --> 04:43.542
Forgive my wife.
She's still upset over the, um...

04:43.625 --> 04:46.375
- Statutory rape thing.
- Helen!

04:46.458 --> 04:48.917
What do you want me to do?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.959
He's refusing to talk to us.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.500
If you could convince him
that he's making a mistake...

04:55.583 --> 04:57.667
John and I made a clean break.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.250
It's best we just keep our distance.

05:00.333 --> 05:06.291
Please. Last week he turned eighteen
and moved out of the house. We're stuck.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.417
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,

05:11.500 --> 05:17.083
I just can't handle this right now.
I have my own personal things going on.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.500
- I don't care.
- Helen...

05:19.625 --> 05:24.709
We haven't gone to the police about what
you did, but that can easily change.

05:28.417 --> 05:31.000
I'll see what I can do.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.041
Good.

05:37.917 --> 05:40.959
So nice to meet you.

05:46.917 --> 05:51.750
You can do this. Scooch down
a few inches and I'll grab ya.

05:51.834 --> 05:54.667
- No. You'll drop me.
- I'm not gonna drop you.

05:54.750 --> 05:58.709
I might strangle you
for climbing up here in the first place.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.250
Come here, ya monsters!

06:02.333 --> 06:05.959
Look who I found
wandering around the airport.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.458
Hey, Rodney!

06:07.542 --> 06:10.208
- Is Parker back up on the roof?
- Yep.

06:10.291 --> 06:13.458
See if he can find that Frisbee
while he's up there.

06:13.542 --> 06:15.166
I'll get right on that.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.458
- How's my favorite girl?
- So happy to see you.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.667
Shame Allison couldn't make it.

06:20.750 --> 06:24.083
Just another business trip
for the wandering salesman.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.875
She'd be bored to tears.
Hey, Parker!

06:27.000 --> 06:30.208
Aren't you gonna give me a hug?
It's Grandpa!

06:30.291 --> 06:33.083
He's scared to climb down.

06:33.208 --> 06:36.750
- Can I give it a shot?
- Yeah, sure. Knock yourself out.

06:36.834 --> 06:39.417
- Yeah.
- Be careful.

06:40.250 --> 06:43.834
Parker, I got a question for you.
It's an important question.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.750
A character-defining question.
Wanna hear it?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.709
Only a girl would be
afraid to come down the ladder.

06:51.792 --> 06:54.792
You're not a little girl, are you?

06:54.875 --> 06:58.083
I'm not looking
at a little girlie-girl, am I?

07:03.083 --> 07:05.875
- Are you OK?
- Come on.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.041
- You got him down. How'd he do that?
- Sexism.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.583
Let's address the division of assets.

07:14.667 --> 07:18.500
We're not prepared to discuss
the primary residence at this time.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.709
Are you prepared to discuss cars?

07:20.792 --> 07:23.458
I'd like to discuss
country club membership.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.250
Access to the facilities
is integral to Dr...

07:26.375 --> 07:29.333
What are we doing here?

07:29.458 --> 07:31.792
I'm sorry, Rex?

07:31.875 --> 07:34.000
I'm talking to my wife.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.500
With lawyers dividing our stuff.

07:36.625 --> 07:40.333
I don't want this.
I thought I did, but I don't.

07:40.417 --> 07:44.959
Maybe we should talk this over
before it's too late.

07:45.041 --> 07:50.875
What do you say, Bree?
Should we send the vultures home?

08:01.500 --> 08:05.834
I wanna keep the club membership.
Rex is terrible at tennis

08:05.959 --> 08:09.041
and he hates buffets.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.709
OK. On page two
of the proposed settlement,

08:11.834 --> 08:15.125
you'll find our prioritized list.

08:15.250 --> 08:16.291
Right.

08:16.750 --> 08:20.250
- They were kissing, huh?
- Right at my kitchen table.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.458
Must have shocked the hell out of 'em.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.333
- I'm glad you can laugh.
- They're being kids.

08:25.417 --> 08:29.125
You're the father of the boy.
I'm the mother of the girl.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.208
If things get out of hand...

08:33.375 --> 08:35.709
What is it you want from me?

08:35.834 --> 08:40.000
Well, I want to know that I am not
the only one who's worried about this.

08:40.083 --> 08:43.750
If the two of them are over here,
I want them supervised.

08:43.834 --> 08:46.875
And I want you
to stop looking at me like I'm crazy.

08:46.959 --> 08:52.291
I'm smiling because it's irrelevant.
I've sold the house.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.917
Really?

08:54.041 --> 08:56.125
We'll be out at the end of the month.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.125
You sold the house?

08:58.208 --> 09:00.792
- Zach...
- Why didn't you tell me?

09:00.875 --> 09:03.000
I wanted to wait till it was official.

09:03.125 --> 09:07.542
- You told me that you'd reconsidered.
- You need to take your medicine.

09:07.625 --> 09:10.792
You think pumping me full of drugs
is gonna keep me quiet?

09:10.917 --> 09:13.250
- Upstairs! Now!
- You don't care about me!

09:13.375 --> 09:15.041
You didn't care about Mom!

09:15.125 --> 09:18.667
You know what?
I wish she'd shot you instead.

09:27.750 --> 09:32.667
So you're moving.
We're all gonna miss you.

09:32.750 --> 09:37.667
Checklist means "is it in the car?"
not like, "do you remember it".

09:37.750 --> 09:42.709
<i>Before Parker Scavo's</i>
<i>Little League game had begun...</i>

09:42.792 --> 09:46.041
- Hurry!
- I'm not the one that forgot my mitt.

09:46.166 --> 09:49.709
<i>...a major player</i>
<i>was about to be tagged out.</i>

09:51.625 --> 09:52.959
Hi.

09:55.166 --> 09:58.333
I thought you guys were at...
at practice.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.750
Parker forgot his catcher's mitt.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.458
Lynette, this is Lois McDaniel.

10:07.542 --> 10:12.333
She's one of my major suppliers.
She's in paper products manufacturing.

10:15.458 --> 10:16.750
It's nice to meet you.

10:16.834 --> 10:19.208
Nice to meet you.
You have a lovely home.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.166
Thank you.

10:21.291 --> 10:24.542
Just working out
some of these new contracts.

10:24.667 --> 10:28.333
Hammering out some of
the little things, the minor details.

10:28.458 --> 10:30.834
Overhead, shipping costs...

10:30.959 --> 10:32.750
Mommy, look what I found.

10:36.083 --> 10:42.500
I'm sorry. These are mine. Thank you.
They must have fallen out of my purse.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.083
Well, we don't want to be late
for the game. Nice to meet you.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.709
- Hey.
- I'm not speaking to you.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.041
Didn't like the settlement talks?

11:10.125 --> 11:12.625
You demanded the good china
because I love it.

11:12.709 --> 11:16.000
You take our timeshare in Aspen
and I'm vindictive?

11:16.125 --> 11:19.959
- You'll hardly ever use that place.
- Hardly? How about never?

11:20.041 --> 11:24.875
Fine. I'm gonna use your good china
for takeout food. Pizza. Spare ribs.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.417
At our next settlement talks,
I plan on asking for your golf clubs.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.583
Isn't divorce fun?

11:36.250 --> 11:39.959
It's time for your heart medication.

11:40.041 --> 11:43.959
I meant what I said at that meeting.
I will fire my lawyer tomorrow.

11:44.041 --> 11:47.625
- Just give me the word.
- Sweetie, I think it's too late.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.709
- Why?
- Because you were unfaithful.

11:50.792 --> 11:53.834
But if you could
find a way to forgive me,

11:53.917 --> 11:57.000
if we could be happy,
wouldn't you want that?

11:57.083 --> 12:01.834
You know what I really,
truly want? Revenge.

12:01.917 --> 12:07.291
I mean, if somehow we could level
the playing field, then, um,

12:07.375 --> 12:09.625
maybe I could find
a way to come back.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.583
So what does that mean?
You want to have an affair?

12:16.291 --> 12:20.750
OK. So who are we talking about here?
Your dopey pharmacist?

12:20.875 --> 12:25.083
Would that hurt you, Rex?
If I slept with another man?

12:25.208 --> 12:29.208
It would devastate me.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.417
Here you go.

12:32.500 --> 12:38.458
- Bree, you can't possibly...
- Rex. Time to take your medicine.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.542
I got it!

13:12.417 --> 13:15.291
<i>She doesn't hate you. Mom just worries.</i>

13:15.375 --> 13:18.959
<i>- She thinks I'm crazy.</i>
<i>- No, she doesn't.</i>

13:19.041 --> 13:21.750
<i>Well, maybe a little.</i>

13:21.834 --> 13:26.792
<i>You didn't tell her what I told you,</i>
<i>about what happened to Dana?</i>

13:26.875 --> 13:31.083
<i>Zach, I can keep a secret.</i>
<i>I promise I will never tell her.</i>

13:33.333 --> 13:35.417
<i>What's that noise?</i>

14:03.500 --> 14:06.208
Hi.
What... what are you doing here?

14:06.333 --> 14:09.500
I was walking outside
and I saw you in the window.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.750
I never thought of you
as a diner person.

14:11.875 --> 14:15.542
I'm not. The coffee's just dreadful.

14:15.667 --> 14:19.208
Well, it's late
and I needed to get out of the house,

14:19.291 --> 14:22.041
and it was the only place still open.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.208
I didn't mean to interrupt.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.417
George?

14:33.750 --> 14:38.458
Would you like to join me
for a dreadful cup of coffee?

14:39.792 --> 14:43.917
It was my first week in college
and I went to a... a meeting

14:44.000 --> 14:46.792
of the Young Republicans
where Rex gave a speech.

14:46.917 --> 14:50.375
And I went up to him afterward
and introduced myself,

14:50.458 --> 14:53.667
told him I agreed with his stance
on the death penalty.

14:53.750 --> 14:57.291
He took me out to a diner and, uh...

14:57.500 --> 15:04.500
we stayed up 'til two talking about
big government, gun control,

15:04.583 --> 15:07.250
and illegal immigration.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.583
It was just...

15:12.166 --> 15:14.375
It was just such a magical night.

15:14.458 --> 15:18.041
And I knew by the time
he got me back to my dorm,

15:18.125 --> 15:23.041
that one day
I was gonna be Mrs. Rex Van de Kamp.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.291
Wow.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.917
And even now,
after the betrayal,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.792
I know that we're
supposed to be together.

15:32.917 --> 15:36.208
But I don't know how I can
be with someone I don't trust.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.291
So, what are you gonna do?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.875
That I don't know.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.083
What do you think I should do?

15:48.208 --> 15:52.500
- You're asking me?
- I should not have done that. I am...

15:52.625 --> 15:53.959
No, it's OK.

15:54.083 --> 15:58.542
No, it was insensitive. I know
how you feel about me, and I...

15:58.625 --> 16:01.000
Bree, I want to help.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.875
Thank you.

16:07.583 --> 16:10.834
So, does he love you?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.291
Yes.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.166
Is he a good person?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.542
Aside from the adultery, yes.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.750
Well, then it's easy.

16:23.083 --> 16:30.083
If I could get a good person to love me,
I would find a way to forgive them.

16:31.667 --> 16:36.125
You are such a special man,
George Williams.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.083
And you deserve
such a special woman.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.250
I think so.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.667
Where are you going?

17:33.750 --> 17:37.834
- I thought I'd eat this in my room.
- The house isn't that big, Rodney.

17:37.917 --> 17:41.208
You're gonna have to stop avoiding me.

17:41.291 --> 17:45.458
OK, OK.
Lois isn't a supplier.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.792
Really?

17:46.917 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, and I want to apologize.

17:49.083 --> 17:53.208
I thought you and the kids
were gonna be gone all afternoon.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.041
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

17:56.125 --> 18:01.000
Well, you can wipe
that disgusting smirk off your face.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.709
Lynette...

18:02.792 --> 18:05.583
How could you do this to Allison?

18:05.667 --> 18:09.208
I don’t know.
It happens a little bit at a time.

18:09.291 --> 18:12.125
Years go by, the kids burn you out,
I'm on the road,

18:12.208 --> 18:14.667
we just drifted apart.
It's complicated.

18:14.792 --> 18:18.417
It's not complicated.
It's completely irresponsible.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.333
I have stayed married
to a woman I don't love,

18:21.417 --> 18:25.417
because I made a vow to God.
Don't talk to me about responsibilities.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.667
So you're the victim?

18:27.792 --> 18:31.417
I can see that we're just going
to have to agree to disagree.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.542
We're not done.

18:32.667 --> 18:37.417
Yeah, we are. 'Cause my sex life
is my own business, not yours.

18:37.500 --> 18:41.667
And there's nothing
you can do about it, anyway.

18:55.792 --> 19:00.875
- Dad? What are you doing?
- I don't want to talk about it.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.500
- Does Lynette know you're out here?
- Oh, yeah. She knows.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.667
- Can you drive me to the airport?
- Wait here.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.959
- Lynette?
- Yeah?

19:10.041 --> 19:14.291
Why is my Dad sitting out on the curb?

19:14.375 --> 19:17.166
Because I kicked him out of the house.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.500
I see. You wanna tell me why?

19:19.583 --> 19:22.792
Hold on. I made you a drink.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.875
Oh, God, what did he do?

19:27.959 --> 19:34.417
Yesterday I came home and
I walked in on your dad with a woman.

19:34.542 --> 19:38.125
He's having an affair.
I am so, so sorry.

19:38.208 --> 19:42.333
- God...
- I know. I know. Are you OK?

19:42.417 --> 19:44.542
Yeah. I should go talk to him.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.542
- That's it?
- What?

19:47.667 --> 19:52.083
I just expected a bigger reaction.
I've got knots in my stomach.

19:52.208 --> 19:56.667
I never mentioned this because
I knew how you'd react. But, um...

19:56.750 --> 20:00.542
I'm not that surprised by this.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.208
My father's
been having affairs for years.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.458
- You knew about this?
- Yeah. Kinda. Yeah.

20:08.583 --> 20:12.750
It was mostly in the past.
I didn't know that he was still at it.

20:12.834 --> 20:16.500
I figured he was too old.
In some strange way, I'm impressed.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.166
Impressed? Impressed? I...

20:20.250 --> 20:23.125
Tom, don't tell me
you're all right with this.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.041
I'm not. He should never
have brought her here.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.500
He shouldn't have been with her at all!

20:28.583 --> 20:31.291
I know.
But, you know, that's who he is.

20:31.375 --> 20:34.709
It's been going on for years.
My mom's made peace with it.

20:34.792 --> 20:38.709
- I seriously doubt that.
- There's no point in this.

20:38.792 --> 20:42.000
I'm gonna bring my father back
and put him in his room.

20:42.083 --> 20:47.166
- And we can all cool off.
- He is not coming back in this house.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.834
- Yes, he is.
- No, he's not.

20:49.959 --> 20:56.959
He is my father, this is my house.
You can't tell me what to do.

20:58.959 --> 21:01.041
I say we kick the door down.

21:01.125 --> 21:06.959
Yeah, Dad, you do that.
Let me know how that works out for you.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.458
Hi...

21:14.333 --> 21:18.709
I don't know if I have the right
address. Does John Rowland live here?

21:20.375 --> 21:24.166
I'm really glad you came by.
I was gonna call you again tomorrow.

21:24.792 --> 21:27.667
Yeah. I'm sorry
I haven't returned any of your calls.

21:27.792 --> 21:32.542
It's OK. I'm just happy to see you.
I heard about Mr. Solis.

21:32.667 --> 21:37.792
- It sucks you had to take a job.
- Well, I'll survive.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.667
Come here.

21:54.333 --> 21:58.417
No. John, I didn't come here for that.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.041
What's wrong?

22:00.166 --> 22:03.875
You're going into gardening full time.
What happened to college?

22:03.959 --> 22:07.000
- I decided not to go.
- Why?

22:07.083 --> 22:10.125
Well, an opportunity
has presented itself,

22:10.250 --> 22:14.000
and for me to take advantage of it,
I need to start making money.

22:14.083 --> 22:19.250
John, what opportunity
is more important than college?

22:19.333 --> 22:23.125
For the longest time, the only thing
I had to offer you was my heart.

22:23.250 --> 22:26.250
Mr. Solis gave you security
and I couldn't compete.

22:26.375 --> 22:29.625
But now he can't offer you that.
I can.

22:29.875 --> 22:36.875
My business is taking off. I can
take care of you. We can be together.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.709
Mrs. Solis,

22:47.875 --> 22:49.917
will you marry me?

22:54.500 --> 22:57.000
Why would you
want to chaperone the dance?

22:57.083 --> 23:00.667
Mrs. Van De Kamp needed volunteers.
She begged me.

23:00.792 --> 23:03.583
You're so transparent.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.125
Anyway, you won't even know I'm there.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.333
Well, not too much.

23:09.208 --> 23:12.417
- You know you can tell me anything.
- Yeah, Mom.

23:12.542 --> 23:16.792
So if you had a problem, or some sort
of secret was weighing on you...?

23:16.917 --> 23:21.542
Of course. I tell you everything.

23:28.417 --> 23:31.875
I can't believe
you're just uprooting us like this.

23:31.959 --> 23:34.000
We need a fresh start.

23:34.125 --> 23:37.625
Here.
You wanna get it about like this.

23:39.458 --> 23:42.166
So many bad things
have happened around here

23:42.291 --> 23:46.250
and finally I have someone I can talk to
and you want to take that away.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.834
- You mean Julie?
- Yeah.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.458
What bad things
do you talk to her about?

23:51.542 --> 23:55.333
- Do you talk about your mother?
- Yeah. And other stuff.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.792
Like what?

23:57.875 --> 23:59.959
Zach. Like what?

24:01.417 --> 24:07.000
Dad, this is what I've been
trying to talk to you about.

24:08.542 --> 24:11.917
Ever since Mom died
I've started to remember things.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.083
Just flashes from when I was little.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.792
Nice and taut, like this.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.166
What kind of things?

24:22.834 --> 24:26.500
Lots of blood. Mom screaming.

24:29.041 --> 24:31.083
And Dana.

24:32.667 --> 24:34.709
I remember killing Dana.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.500
You told this to Julie?

24:40.166 --> 24:42.208
I trust her.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.417
Did she tell her mother?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.041
I don't know.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.583
Start from the beginning.

24:52.667 --> 24:55.667
Tell me everything that you told Julie.

25:11.125 --> 25:13.417
- Hey.
- Hey. What's that?

25:13.542 --> 25:19.542
I was going to give it to you, but I saw
the other girls weren't wearing flowers.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.750
I guess it's not that kind of dance.

25:22.875 --> 25:26.208
If you don't want to stand out,
I'd understand.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.375
I like standing out.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.667
What's Paul doing here?

25:54.750 --> 25:58.417
He's chaperoning.
He called and volunteered.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.166
- Really?
- What's wrong?

26:00.250 --> 26:03.333
He could have cared less
about Julie and Zach dating.

26:03.417 --> 26:05.500
And now he shows up at the dance?

26:05.625 --> 26:07.792
Maybe he's trying to be supportive.

26:07.917 --> 26:10.000
Maybe.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.667
Dr Van De Kamp.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.500
My cardiologist
phoned in a prescription.

26:22.625 --> 26:25.417
Oh, right.
I've got it here somewhere.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.917
So, have you seen Bree lately?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.792
I ran into her last night
on Maple Avenue.

26:32.917 --> 26:38.875
- We had a nice talk.
- That's all you did? Just talked?

26:38.959 --> 26:41.625
We're just friends. Nothing more.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.041
That's good to hear.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.166
If you ever do get a vibe from Bree

26:46.250 --> 26:49.375
that she's interested in more
than just friendship,

26:49.458 --> 26:51.792
I'd be careful if I were you.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.458
Excuse me?

26:53.583 --> 26:58.709
I just want you to know that she'd only
be using you to even the score with me.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.834
Don't fall for it.

27:00.917 --> 27:04.500
Bree would never do anything like that.
She's a lady.

27:04.625 --> 27:08.750
Exactly.
A very beautiful, classy lady.

27:08.834 --> 27:14.750
Remember, they tend to end up
with doctors. Not pharmacists.

27:18.500 --> 27:24.458
Bree is very beautiful. And very classy.
But she's not very perceptive.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.625
For instance,
she thinks you're a good person.

27:27.709 --> 27:31.834
And it's now very clear to me,
you aren't.

27:35.875 --> 27:38.667
I'd like my prescription now, George.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.542
I can't seem to find it.
I guess I'll have to have it delivered.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.542
Thank you.

27:54.625 --> 27:58.000
No, thank you.

28:44.542 --> 28:45.750
Paul.

28:45.834 --> 28:49.792
Did you notice
they're playing a classic?

28:49.917 --> 28:50.917
Yeah.

28:51.875 --> 28:54.792
Care to dance?

28:57.083 --> 28:59.166
I'd love to.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.834
I have a little confession to make.

29:13.125 --> 29:15.166
I've been so concerned
about Julie,

29:15.291 --> 29:18.792
that I sort of eavesdropped on her
the other day,

29:18.917 --> 29:22.458
while she was having
a phone conversation with Zach.

29:22.542 --> 29:23.792
Really?

29:24.583 --> 29:27.333
They were having
an interesting conversation.

29:27.458 --> 29:29.291
About?

29:29.375 --> 29:34.625
Zach was telling Julie
about what happened to Dana.

29:34.709 --> 29:38.417
- Was he now?
- Yes.

29:39.959 --> 29:42.959
- How much did you hear?
- Everything.

29:48.959 --> 29:52.000
You realize it was an accident.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.959
Of course. I assumed as much.

29:55.041 --> 29:57.709
He didn't mean to kill Dana.

29:59.834 --> 30:04.875
He was practically a baby himself.
He didn't understand what he was doing.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.500
No, of course he didn't.
So what happened exactly?

30:11.667 --> 30:14.917
Mary Alice and I never really knew.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.417
We heard the baby screaming.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.000
When we got up to the crib,
it was too late.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.208
Paul, I am so sorry.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.500
Thank you.

30:30.834 --> 30:35.500
So you and Mary Alice just kept this
to yourselves all these years?

30:35.583 --> 30:41.709
It was a very dark chapter in our lives.
We preferred not to relive it.

30:41.792 --> 30:46.959
It was also a private family matter.
I'd appreciate your discretion.

30:55.041 --> 30:56.083
Sure.

31:10.542 --> 31:14.375
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah, I did.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.542
It was great.

31:21.041 --> 31:25.500
Look, I want you to know that
I'm really sorry I talked to Julie.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.458
But she promised
not to say anything to her Mom.

31:28.542 --> 31:31.583
It's OK. I handled Susan.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.500
Good.

31:33.583 --> 31:37.500
But we need to talk about these things
that you think you remember.

31:37.583 --> 31:40.417
They're not true.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.166
How can they not be true?

31:43.250 --> 31:45.375
Memories lie, Zach.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.875
You didn't kill anyone.

31:54.875 --> 31:57.333
Dana is very much alive.

32:13.625 --> 32:16.583
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Where is it?

32:16.667 --> 32:20.166
- What?
- The ring. My grandmother's ring.

32:20.291 --> 32:23.500
John caught me off guard.
I'm going to give back the ring.

32:23.583 --> 32:26.208
Well, you'd better.
Because make no mistake,

32:26.291 --> 32:31.542
if you try to ruin my son's life,
I will ruin yours.

32:31.625 --> 32:36.125
Helen! OK, go to the car.
Come on, please. Just... please.

32:40.709 --> 32:45.417
Obviously, I'm not leaving my husband
and marrying John.

32:45.542 --> 32:47.583
I think that's wise.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.667
I'll talk to John tomorrow
and give back the ring.

32:50.750 --> 32:55.000
Good, good.
We appreciate everything you've done.

32:55.667 --> 33:00.583
Hey, Bob,
I get why she's so angry with me.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.667
But what I don't
get is why you're so nice.

33:03.750 --> 33:07.959
Well, John's a big boy. Whatever
happened between the two of you

33:08.041 --> 33:10.917
was his mistake as much as yours.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.458
I guess. I understand if, uh,
if you hate me just a little.

33:28.542 --> 33:35.291
When I was a kid, I always played
by the rules. I never cheated on a test.

33:35.375 --> 33:40.291
Never even missed a curfew.
But I can't help but think

33:42.667 --> 33:47.542
how wonderful it would have been to have
made at least one mistake like you.

33:49.750 --> 33:52.959
That's sweet.
You... you're very sweet.

33:53.041 --> 33:56.041
Well, I'm a little sweet.

33:58.125 --> 34:01.125
Mostly I'm just middle-aged.

34:20.000 --> 34:25.333
Are you OK? I know
this is a lot to digest all at once.

34:25.417 --> 34:29.333
I'm fine. I'm just happy
you finally told me the truth.

34:31.917 --> 34:36.542
One thing, though.
Why are you telling me all this now?

34:36.625 --> 34:40.625
I couldn't let you think
you killed someone.

34:40.709 --> 34:43.208
No one should carry that kind of burden.

34:43.291 --> 34:46.709
- You didn't want me running my mouth.
- It's not about that.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.166
Yes, it is.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.834
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep your secret.

34:57.625 --> 35:01.542
- Dad?
- Thank you.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.250
But we're not moving.

35:05.291 --> 35:07.875
That's out of the question.

35:09.458 --> 35:14.375
I'm not leaving Julie. And if you
want my support, that's the deal.

35:14.458 --> 35:17.125
- And if I refuse?
- You won't.

35:31.667 --> 35:36.750
So here's the thing; I feel
really awful about how I acted before.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.625
You threw me out of my own house.

35:39.709 --> 35:42.875
I overreacted. I know. I'm sorry.

35:44.542 --> 35:51.125
Look, I know you love my mom. But how
she decides to live her life is just...

35:51.208 --> 35:53.291
it's entirely up to her.

35:53.375 --> 35:58.125
You're right. You're right. I guess
I just got so upset because...

35:59.792 --> 36:02.917
Oh, whatever.
Let's not beat a dead horse.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.208
It's over. I'm sorry. Good night.

36:11.875 --> 36:14.375
OK. Get it off your chest.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.667
You knew he was having a affair
and it didn't bother you.

36:17.750 --> 36:22.542
And that worries me because
if you can condone something like that,

36:22.667 --> 36:27.083
then what's gonna happen when you've
been on the road for 40 years?

36:27.208 --> 36:30.667
Lynette, I'm not my father.

36:30.750 --> 36:34.000
I know. Of course.
You're not your father.

36:40.750 --> 36:45.083
And just so we're absolutely clear,
I am definitely not your mother.

36:45.166 --> 36:48.041
Because if you ever betray me,
I will leave you.

36:48.125 --> 36:52.500
I will take the kids,
and you will never see any of us again.

36:54.458 --> 36:58.834
Whew. Glad to get that off my chest.
Thank you. I love you.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.875
- Couldn't sleep, huh?
- No.

37:10.959 --> 37:16.041
Me either.
I'm sorry about the ruckus I caused.

37:16.125 --> 37:20.458
It's OK. I'm not...
I'm not upset about that.

37:20.583 --> 37:22.667
- No?
- No.

37:24.333 --> 37:26.208
What's wrong?

37:28.291 --> 37:30.917
There's something Lynette doesn't know.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.166
Something that I did.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.959
And I don't know what's gonna happen
if she ever finds out.

37:42.166 --> 37:47.875
<i>The next morning, Gabrielle returned the</i>
<i>engagement ring to her former lover.</i>

37:47.959 --> 37:50.375
<i>A gesture that was met with</i>

37:50.458 --> 37:52.208
<i>measured enthusiasm.</i>

37:52.291 --> 37:55.291
- Please, calm down.
- This doesn't make any sense.

37:55.417 --> 37:58.291
- I know you love me.
- Love isn't enough.

37:58.417 --> 38:02.834
Where would we live? Here? The only
decoration in the bathroom is a bong.

38:02.959 --> 38:06.750
- We could get our own place.
- You're barely making minimum wage.

38:06.834 --> 38:09.250
We'd be poor at first.
But we'd be happy.

38:09.333 --> 38:13.083
I've tried "poor but happy".
Guess what? I wasn't that happy.

38:13.166 --> 38:17.583
But Mr. Solis is going to jail.
You want to stick around for that?

38:17.667 --> 38:22.333
I don't know. You know, every once in a
while even I want to do the right thing.

38:23.959 --> 38:29.500
Mrs. Solis, I love you so much. I mean,
doesn't that mean anything to you?

38:33.583 --> 38:36.000
Honestly? No.

38:36.125 --> 38:39.417
John, you're a toy. A sweet dumb toy.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.583
So you might as well go to college,
because you and me,

38:42.667 --> 38:44.750
no future.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.834
Mrs. Mayer. Hey, is Julie home?

38:55.917 --> 38:58.041
She's in the shower.

38:58.125 --> 39:01.583
Well, I just came by to give her
some good news.

39:01.709 --> 39:04.083
What's that?

39:04.208 --> 39:07.667
It turns out my that
my dad and I aren't moving after all.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.542
- What?
- He reconsidered.

39:09.667 --> 39:13.041
So I guess we're gonna keep
living across the street.

39:13.125 --> 39:15.542
OK. Wow.

39:16.834 --> 39:18.875
Wow.

39:18.959 --> 39:22.709
You know, can you sit down?
I need to talk to you.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.166
Hey...

39:33.750 --> 39:37.500
Did you know that Julie is
the first girl I ever gave a flower to?

39:37.583 --> 39:39.709
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:40.500 --> 39:42.792
Yeah, I really like her, Mrs. Mayer.

39:47.083 --> 39:49.375
Julie is only 14 years old.

39:49.458 --> 39:53.250
And sometimes girls, when they're
that age, they just don't

39:53.333 --> 39:56.834
always make the right decisions.

39:56.917 --> 40:01.750
As her mother,
it is my responsibility to protect her.

40:01.917 --> 40:05.208
You want to protect her from me?

40:05.291 --> 40:11.709
No, I just... I think
that you should slow things down.

40:11.792 --> 40:15.291
I want you to not see her for a while.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.083
No.

40:19.166 --> 40:23.083
- No?
- You're not taking her away from me.

40:23.166 --> 40:27.917
I know being dramatic is the birthright
of every teenager, but come on.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.500
Why are you laughing?
Do you think this is funny?

40:33.333 --> 40:36.625
Thank you, you have just made this
really easy for me.

40:36.709 --> 40:40.250
You are forbidden from seeing
or talking to Julie ever again.

40:40.333 --> 40:45.417
If you come within ten feet of her,
I will have you arrested. Now get out.

41:12.166 --> 41:14.625
<i>Sooner or later the time comes</i>

41:14.709 --> 41:18.291
<i>when we all must become</i>
<i>responsible adults...</i>

41:20.750 --> 41:27.750
<i>...and learn to give up what we want,</i>
<i>so we can choose to do what is right.</i>

41:31.834 --> 41:36.834
<i>Of course, a lifetime</i>
<i>of responsibility isn't always easy.</i>

41:42.125 --> 41:45.709
<i>And as the years go on,</i>

41:45.792 --> 41:49.750
<i>it's a burden that can become</i>
<i>too heavy for some to bear.</i>

41:49.917 --> 41:56.917
<i>But still we try to do what is best.</i>
<i>What is good. Not only for ourselves.</i>

41:57.083 --> 41:59.125
<i>But for those we love.</i>

42:06.792 --> 42:09.291
- Hey.
- I'm glad you came.

42:09.375 --> 42:13.625
Zach, I can't stay long.
If my mom catches me, she'll freak.

42:13.709 --> 42:15.834
Come here.

42:20.500 --> 42:25.625
She said I can't see you anymore.
What are we gonna do?

42:25.709 --> 42:27.750
I'm not sure.

42:31.583 --> 42:37.792
<i>Yes, sooner or later,</i>
<i>we must all become responsible adults.</i>

42:37.875 --> 42:41.583
<i>No one knows this better than the young.</i>
