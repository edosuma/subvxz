00:07.173 --> 00:09.698
Jonathan, what are you doing up there?

00:09.876 --> 00:11.707
Clark should be doing that.

00:11.878 --> 00:15.541
Sweetheart, I'm fine.
Would you stop worrying?

00:19.652 --> 00:22.246
Jonathan, please be careful.

00:22.422 --> 00:25.516
Martha, my father and I built this roof.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.559
I could walk this roof with my eyes closed.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.929
You know what the doctor said
about taking it easy.

00:35.101 --> 00:38.935
You know, the last time I checked,
the doctor didn't have a farm to run.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.180
Jonathan?

00:51.684 --> 00:52.946
Jonathan!

00:55.822 --> 00:57.084
Clark!

01:10.170 --> 01:12.536
Dad, what are you doing, trying to fly?

01:12.705 --> 01:15.037
-Are you all right?
-Jonathan!

01:15.875 --> 01:19.606
It was just that noise.
Where the hell did that come from?

01:19.779 --> 01:21.246
I didn't hear anything.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.943
It was probably nothing.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.020
Dad, look, you don't have to--

01:29.189 --> 01:31.384
Damn it, Kal-El, I can get it myself.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.116
Kal-El?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.958
Why'd you call me that?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.621
I don't know.

01:38.798 --> 01:41.028
You heard a noise.
What did it sound like?

01:41.201 --> 01:44.193
-lt was just a loud, high-pitched--
-Hum? It was the key.

01:44.370 --> 01:47.965
Clark, I slipped and fell off the roof, okay?

01:48.441 --> 01:50.773
Are you sure this has nothing
to do with Jor-El?

01:50.944 --> 01:53.435
I thought we agreed
we were gonna drop that.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.260
What?

02:50.036 --> 02:51.765
He is?

02:52.939 --> 02:56.306
All right, have the chopper standing by.

03:12.425 --> 03:15.394
Why did you have to bring him
into this, Jor-El?

03:17.630 --> 03:22.033
Whatever promises my dad made,
I'll take them on.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.399
Come on!

03:26.206 --> 03:29.403
Come on, Jor-El, I'm the one you want!

03:51.130 --> 03:54.566
Who is that? Who's down here?

03:56.836 --> 03:59.930
Oh, Clark, it's you.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.937
Don't let me interrupt you.

04:05.745 --> 04:09.738
-I just came down here to be alone.
-Yeah, I can understand that.

04:09.916 --> 04:15.218
Sometimes, when I'm down here,
and I look at these walls...

04:15.388 --> 04:20.451
...I feel as if it might be possible
to solve the mysteries of the universe.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.894
What do you think?

04:25.064 --> 04:27.294
I think it's time for me to go.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.901
Clark.

04:31.204 --> 04:36.107
How's your father?
How's his recovery progressing?

04:38.344 --> 04:40.471
He's better.

04:41.080 --> 04:45.847
I can only imagine how difficult it must be
for you to see him so....

04:46.552 --> 04:47.814
So weak.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.657
Weak, strong, healthy, he's still my dad...

04:52.825 --> 04:54.383
...and I love him.

04:54.560 --> 04:55.959
Of course you do.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.930
A son's love for a father,
there's nothing to compare it to.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.596
After all, you only get one.

05:25.224 --> 05:26.623
Clark?

06:26.686 --> 06:29.951
I'm having a strange case of deja vu.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.991
Why the sudden resurgence
of interest in the caves?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.060
Lex...

06:36.662 --> 06:41.964
...Iisten, something truly extraordinary
has happened.

06:42.135 --> 06:46.231
Do you remember the octagonal hole,
or the indentation...

06:46.406 --> 06:49.307
...that was in one of the walls
of the cave?

06:49.475 --> 06:52.740
I'm sorry, Dad.
That's your obsession, not mine.

06:52.912 --> 06:58.612
All right, but you remember
the hole was sealed over?

07:00.319 --> 07:04.119
Yesterday, I found Clark Kent down there.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.985
-Clark.
-Yes.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.821
And the hole was open.
He'd opened it somehow.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.565
You know, Dad...

07:14.734 --> 07:18.693
...they say mental illness is hereditary.

07:19.405 --> 07:22.670
I'm willing to accept my break with reality.
Are you?

07:22.842 --> 07:26.005
Oh, Lex, men of vision
have so often been mocked.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.977
Galileo knew it was the Earth
that orbited the sun...

07:29.148 --> 07:31.639
...and he was sentenced to death
for that discovery.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.809
Where's the lnquisition
when you need it?

07:33.986 --> 07:37.820
Don't let your friendship
with Clark Kent blind you, son.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.016
Don't forget it was Clark
who discovered the caves.

07:41.194 --> 07:45.460
Then one of the symbols from the caves
mysteriously appeared on his barn.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.431
The hole sealed itself up the same day
that explosion happened on his farm.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.799
-Probably coincidence.
-Coincidence.

07:52.972 --> 07:56.772
That's an explanation
used by fools and liars.

07:57.710 --> 08:03.376
Lex, we could accomplish so much
if we work together.

08:03.549 --> 08:07.349
Don't pretend that this isn't
an obsession that you and I share.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.750
We both know that you have
an entire archive...

08:09.922 --> 08:12.686
...devoted to uncovering the mystery
of Clark Kent...

08:12.859 --> 08:17.228
...and if you won 't help me,
I'll find someone else who will.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.307
You said there' d be more time.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.847
Who are you talking to?

08:39.452 --> 08:43.479
I'm not talking to anybody, Clark.
I'm just thinking out loud, that's all.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.715
Were you talking to Jor-El?

08:45.892 --> 08:48.725
Listen, son, not everything
is about your real father, okay?

08:49.328 --> 08:52.092
-He's not my real father.
-Yes, he is, Clark.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.494
He is.

08:58.838 --> 09:02.706
He's gonna be around this place
long after I'm gone, anyway.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.176
Dad, what's going on with you?

09:05.344 --> 09:08.836
I don't expect you to understand
any of this stuff, Clark, but l....

09:09.815 --> 09:12.841
I almost died, and I look
around here and I think...

09:13.019 --> 09:15.749
...what in the hell did l
really accomplish anyway?

09:15.922 --> 09:18.117
You're lucky, Clark.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.522
You won't ever have to face
your mortality.

09:22.094 --> 09:24.028
But if you did...

09:26.065 --> 09:29.057
...you'd find yourself
reevaluating your choices too.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.802
Like taking me in?

09:36.642 --> 09:38.837
Clark, no, that's not....

09:39.845 --> 09:44.407
I would never regret that.
There's just so many chances I never took.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.643
I have to live with my mistakes.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.445
Don't let my mistakes be yours.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.821
You're tired.

09:57.396 --> 09:58.829
Let's go inside.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.270
The last thing we want to do
is call more attention to this.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.987
That looks a little heavy for Psych 1 01.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.691
I'm just trying to get a handle
on what my dad's going through.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.266
The surgery and everything.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.134
When I was in the hospital
the doctors told me...

10:40.306 --> 10:43.139
...that depression's pretty common
after a major surgery.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.710
He's just not the same dad I know.

10:47.880 --> 10:52.146
He keeps talking about all these
opportunities he missed in his life.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.744
Clark, it's gonna be okay.

10:55.921 --> 10:59.152
There isn't anything
that you can't recover from.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.189
What if you screw up something so badly
you can never get it back?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.662
I guess that depends
on how determined you are.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.002
So what's with the cave obsession?

11:18.177 --> 11:21.544
You listened to the conversation.
It's one of my father's eccentricities.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.205
Along with Clark Kent?

11:24.383 --> 11:27.250
Trust me, Clark has nothing
to do with my father.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.650
That's not what it sounded like to me.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.757
When the Metropolis police
had that noose around your neck...

11:32.925 --> 11:36.417
-...you offered us full disclosure--
-Look, don't try to hang this on me.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.632
Before I agreed to help, all you had
on my father was creative bookkeeping.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.827
I'm giving you illegal cellular research,
cloning, crimes against humanity.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.369
So leave Clark out of this.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.468
"You've got an entire archive
devoted to unlocking...

11:52.645 --> 11:55.842
...the mystery of Clark Kent."

11:56.682 --> 12:00.140
That sounds to me like more
than your average kid from Podunk.

12:02.354 --> 12:07.018
Maybe if I speak into the microphone,
you'll hear it clearer.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.559
Clark Kent is nobody.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.995
A nobody who's pals
with Dr. Virgil Swann?

12:40.459 --> 12:44.953
Corporate titans don't often show up
at my doorstep unannounced.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.231
I apologize for surprising you like this,
Dr. Swann...

12:51.403 --> 12:54.395
...but it's a matter of some urgency.

12:54.573 --> 12:58.566
I've been wondering how long it would
take you to finally walk through the door.

12:58.744 --> 13:02.236
Then you obviously know why I'm here.

13:02.414 --> 13:06.373
I think, perhaps, you've been reading
my e-mails to Clark Kent. Am I correct?

13:09.188 --> 13:12.919
My transgression doesn't seem
to upset you. I'm glad.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.855
I'm a scientist.

13:15.728 --> 13:19.289
I find curiosity to be
a most admirable trait.

13:20.866 --> 13:26.168
Dr. Swann, I am the conservator
of the Kawatche Caves.

13:26.338 --> 13:30.297
If you can tell me what is written
on the cave walls...

13:30.476 --> 13:34.879
...I would agree to hand over
that conservancy to your foundation.

13:35.181 --> 13:38.082
Well, thank you,
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.115
The language remains a mystery to me.

13:42.454 --> 13:47.892
Are you aware that at one time
there was an octagonal keyhole...

13:48.561 --> 13:50.552
...on the wall of the cave?

13:50.729 --> 13:53.220
It was sealed for months.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.458
Then it reopened suddenly.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.398
Just after our friend Clark
had been down there.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.967
Then you don't need me.
You need a locksmith.

14:02.808 --> 14:04.332
Right, but...

14:04.510 --> 14:08.207
...the key to that lock
was in my possession...

14:09.582 --> 14:12.210
...but it was stolen from my safe.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.712
Again, Clark had been present.

14:15.287 --> 14:18.313
So now you believe that he has it.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.020
He trusts you.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.390
Would you be willing to talk to him?

14:28.567 --> 14:31.058
It's such a small price to pay...

14:31.237 --> 14:34.866
...in exchange for the answers
you've been searching for.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.476
Yes, well, I know what I'm after...

14:39.578 --> 14:41.512
...but what do you expect to find?

14:47.119 --> 14:49.280
You're dying.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.048
How do you know that?

14:54.493 --> 14:58.054
As I said, curiosity is an admirable trait.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.602
Dr. Swann...

15:05.471 --> 15:09.874
...I know that what can save my life
is locked within the wall of that cave.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.914
I believe in the extraordinary...

15:16.548 --> 15:19.574
...in the possibilities it holds.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.113
But I prefer to follow my own path.

15:30.729 --> 15:32.458
All right.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.498
Thank you for your time, doctor.

15:41.307 --> 15:44.208
Even if you had the key...

15:45.344 --> 15:49.371
...you have no idea what would happen
if you put it into the lock.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.811
I'd be willing to take that risk.

15:57.923 --> 16:02.360
Then perhaps there is
an arrangement we might make.

16:22.247 --> 16:26.877
Clark. I'm afraid I've invaded
your sanctuary.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.715
-What do you think you'll find down here?
-You tell me.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.948
How'd you open it, Clark?

16:33.125 --> 16:36.788
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I don't want to play games.

16:36.962 --> 16:42.867
You expect me to believe your fascination
with these caves started with a term paper?

16:43.035 --> 16:45.026
No, do it again.

16:45.204 --> 16:49.197
I don't think you wanna start talking
about unusual obsessions, Mr. Luthor.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.641
Unless you want to explain why you
blackmailed my friends into spying on me.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.274
I believe that we're put on this Earth
for a reason, Clark.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.878
Our task in life is to find out
what that reason is.

17:03.455 --> 17:07.084
Sometimes, we can't do that alone.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.327
You're never gonna find
what you're looking for.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.134
I'm much closer than you think.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.718
What's going on here?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.220
Take the barn. The rest follow me.
Martha Kent?

17:38.791 --> 17:41.817
-What are you doing?
-FBl. We're searching this place.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.986
-You can't.
-We can, and we will.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.189
Excuse me, ma'am, we need you outside.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.736
Hi, Mom.
You must be out looking for Dad too.

18:26.905 --> 18:30.602
I think I have an idea where he is.
I'll see you soon.

18:34.179 --> 18:37.114
Thanks for the phone.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.613
Clark, what's going on?

18:42.754 --> 18:45.348
My dad kind of went AWOL.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.049
He was halfway through
unloading the feed run...

18:48.227 --> 18:51.492
...and just jumped in his truck
and took off.

18:53.899 --> 18:56.459
I'm sorry, Lana. It's....

18:56.768 --> 19:01.034
-He's never done anything like this before.
-Hey, you know what?

19:02.541 --> 19:04.065
It's gonna be okay.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.611
I didn't mean to unload on you like that.

19:07.112 --> 19:08.409
No, you....

19:08.580 --> 19:12.676
You never have to apologize
for opening up to me.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.165
Lana?

19:35.440 --> 19:38.705
I know this is a stressful time for you.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.937
No. That's not what this is about.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.148
Lana, I don't want to
look back like my dad...

19:46.418 --> 19:48.852
...and wonder what my life
could've been.

19:50.889 --> 19:52.186
Clark.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.619
We've tried this once before.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.226
You said there's nothing
you can't recover from.

19:59.398 --> 20:02.333
No, I wasn't talking about us.

20:04.603 --> 20:08.130
Look, right now,
think about your dad, okay?

20:08.307 --> 20:10.741
He's the one who needs you.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.371
Yeah.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.997
Dad, are you okay?

20:34.199 --> 20:36.895
Mom and I have been
worried sick about you.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.061
You can't just take off like that.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.531
How'd you know to find me out here?

20:44.576 --> 20:48.137
When I'm searching for answers,
I turn to my dad.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.148
I guess it runs in the family.

20:52.317 --> 20:55.912
Your grandfather was
the stubbornest man I ever knew.

20:57.856 --> 21:00.324
And believe me...

21:02.361 --> 21:05.296
...Clark, I wasn't nearly the son you are.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.630
My mother used to say that...

21:10.068 --> 21:14.801
...he and I were like watching
two sides of the same coin...

21:16.642 --> 21:18.269
...duking it out.

21:20.512 --> 21:22.605
I see the way you and Jor-El fight
and I wonder...

21:22.781 --> 21:25.443
...if maybe fathers and sons
were the same on Krypton.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.246
Except he's not my father. You are.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.756
Yeah.

21:34.159 --> 21:38.459
I am your father who turns his back on you
when you need him the most.

21:40.065 --> 21:43.466
I am your father
who forces you to run away.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.932
My father never would've done that.

21:51.576 --> 21:54.773
I wish I had his strength and his wisdom.

21:55.013 --> 21:56.844
Dad, you do.

21:58.216 --> 22:01.208
Clark, I don't know
how to protect you anymore.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.087
That's not your job.

22:07.292 --> 22:11.058
Your job is to teach me
how to protect myself...

22:11.630 --> 22:14.724
...but that doesn't mean I don't need you.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.526
Mom needs you too.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.207
Let's go home.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.793
I realize paying the Talon's bills...

22:49.968 --> 22:53.131
...isn't the high point of your month...

22:54.172 --> 22:56.732
...but I'm guessing
something else is going on.

22:57.642 --> 23:00.634
No. No, everything's fine.

23:02.614 --> 23:05.879
Lana, you know you could
talk to me about anything.

23:18.764 --> 23:23.827
I wanna believe that
someone can change, but....

23:30.175 --> 23:32.973
But I'm starting to lose faith.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.614
Are we talking about Clark?

23:51.263 --> 23:55.996
You know, he came by the Talon earlier...

23:57.569 --> 23:59.730
...and he kissed me.

24:01.006 --> 24:02.371
He kissed you?

24:06.478 --> 24:08.241
Isn't that what you wanted?

24:10.515 --> 24:12.642
God, I don't....

24:17.456 --> 24:19.253
I don't know.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.823
Look.

24:34.172 --> 24:38.871
I'm afraid I'm a little jaded
in the romance department.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.973
The only thing I know
about relationships is that...

24:44.950 --> 24:47.646
...someone usually winds up
getting hurt.

24:51.356 --> 24:54.587
And you don't think I can
trust Clark to not do that?

24:57.529 --> 25:00.157
I don't think it's about trust.

25:01.466 --> 25:04.264
It's like the German poet Rilke said:

25:04.970 --> 25:09.634
A person isn't who they are during
the last conversation you had with them.

25:11.810 --> 25:16.213
They're who they've been
throughout your whole relationship.

25:32.597 --> 25:35.259
-Mom!
-Oh, thank God you're back.

25:35.433 --> 25:38.493
-What happened?
-The FBl came and tore through everything.

25:38.904 --> 25:41.338
-What did they want?
-They had a search warrant.

25:41.506 --> 25:44.441
The only thing that's missing is the key.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.381
I have to get that back.
If they find out what it's for....

25:52.551 --> 25:55.076
-lt doesn't matter, Clark.
-How can you say that?

25:56.087 --> 25:58.555
Because they didn't get
what they came for.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.504
Lex!

26:18.677 --> 26:20.645
Clark, I'm busy. Can this wait?

26:20.812 --> 26:23.280
The FBl just raided our farm.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.856
Any idea why?

26:39.030 --> 26:42.830
They didn't say, but for some reason,
I think your dad's involved.

26:44.202 --> 26:48.366
Clark, I can't imagine my father's
on the FBl's most trusted list...

26:48.540 --> 26:51.031
...but I'm curious why you think
he'd be interested.

26:51.209 --> 26:54.007
I talked to him today.
He said some crazy things.

26:54.179 --> 26:57.478
He thinks I can give him answers
about the caves.

26:57.849 --> 26:59.817
Can you?

27:00.118 --> 27:04.851
My father's methods can be questionable,
but usually there's truth in his madness.

27:05.256 --> 27:10.023
He's so obsessed about those caves
that he's imagining things that don't exist.

27:11.730 --> 27:14.665
Clark, I'm glad you told me about this.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.959
It means a lot that you trust me
enough to let me help.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.799
Is there something you're not telling me?

27:24.109 --> 27:26.100
And what would that be, Clark?

27:29.547 --> 27:31.310
I'll check into it.

27:40.592 --> 27:43.152
What the hell were you doing
at the Kent farm?

27:43.328 --> 27:44.625
Be quiet.

27:44.796 --> 27:48.960
You're bound and determined
to blow our cover, aren't you? Get in here.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.206
If I want to look at Clark Kent,
you won't have much to say about it.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.708
-Those weren't your men?
-We don't storm farmhouses as a habit.

28:02.113 --> 28:04.445
What is it about this kid
you're trying to protect?

28:28.239 --> 28:30.434
Look, Luthor, this is my show.

28:30.608 --> 28:34.601
-Do I need to remind you you came to us?
-Like I had a choice.

28:34.846 --> 28:39.249
You know the deal.
The FBl isn't interested in some farm boy.

28:39.417 --> 28:41.783
We're interested in your father.

28:41.953 --> 28:45.047
Now, get out of here
so we can do our work.

28:52.931 --> 28:55.456
Your father's not working with the FBl!
It's you!

28:55.633 --> 28:58.500
-Clark, you have to trust me.
-I did.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.128
I guess it was a bad mistake.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.934
Clark, you've got it all wrong!

29:04.109 --> 29:06.976
Look, it's not about you!
We're going after my father!

29:08.012 --> 29:11.641
He tried to pin the murders at Metron Labs
on me, so I went to the feds...

29:11.816 --> 29:13.841
...and I cut a deal.

29:14.018 --> 29:16.646
Look, over and over...

29:16.821 --> 29:19.813
...I've given him the chance
to show me who he really is...

29:19.991 --> 29:23.586
...and I now realize he already has.
He deserves what's coming to him.

29:23.762 --> 29:28.131
-You don't care whose privacy gets invaded.
-lt wasn't the FBl who raided the farm.

29:28.299 --> 29:32.429
My father may have had men impersonate
the feds. The question is why.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.698
Maybe he's on to you!
Maybe he's warning you to back off.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.638
If that's the case,
I'm sorry he got you involved...

29:38.810 --> 29:42.302
-...but I think you already were.
-What's that supposed to mean?

29:42.480 --> 29:46.041
How well do you know
a Dr. Virgil Swann?

29:46.518 --> 29:48.816
What makes you think I know him at all?

29:48.987 --> 29:51.547
According to the FBl,
my father's been talking to him...

29:51.723 --> 29:54.021
...and he found Dr. Swann through you.

29:54.192 --> 29:55.989
You two have been e-mailing each other?

29:56.161 --> 29:58.459
He's been studying the cave paintings.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.689
I don't know how you
stumbled into this...

30:01.099 --> 30:05.661
...but somehow you've got two billionaires
keenly interested in you and those caves.

30:06.204 --> 30:09.503
They're your enemies, not me.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.349
You betrayed me!

30:19.517 --> 30:21.041
Hello, Kal-El.

30:21.886 --> 30:23.376
My name is Clark.

30:24.088 --> 30:27.387
You think I betrayed you
because I met with Lionel Luthor?

30:27.559 --> 30:30.494
You did more than meet with him.
You agreed to help him.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.153
I didn't betray you, Kal-El.

30:33.331 --> 30:37.461
I promised you your secret would never
leave this building, and it hasn't.

30:37.635 --> 30:41.036
My involvement with Lionel Luthor
is in your best interest.

30:41.272 --> 30:43.740
That man has done nothing
but cause my family pain.

30:44.742 --> 30:47.370
Was he the one who caused
the explosion on the farm?

30:47.545 --> 30:51.242
Did he make you run wild in Metropolis?

30:53.251 --> 30:56.311
I opened the door to your heritage...

30:56.487 --> 30:59.320
...because I thought that you were ready.

31:00.658 --> 31:03.320
Your actions over the past year
have proven me wrong.

31:04.028 --> 31:06.326
You don't understand.

31:07.298 --> 31:11.701
There was another message in the ship,
from my biological father.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.101
It said I was sent here to conquer.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.968
Do you know if that's true?

31:19.677 --> 31:22.168
I don't have all the answers.

31:23.448 --> 31:26.781
I'm still on the same journey
as you are, Kal-El.

31:26.951 --> 31:31.388
Please. Don't call me that.
I don't even know who that is.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.354
Fathers often want futures
that their sons reject.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.689
That struggle is as old
as the human race.

31:39.697 --> 31:43.064
Except I'm not human.

31:43.401 --> 31:47.895
Humanity is not only about biology.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.066
Look, you don't know Jor-El.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.902
Everything that he said
has come to pass.

31:55.079 --> 31:58.879
My father made a deal with him to save me,
and now it's killing him.

31:59.183 --> 32:02.584
But the more you pursue this course,
the greater the risk...

32:02.954 --> 32:06.720
...that you'll expose your secret
not only to the Luthors...

32:06.891 --> 32:08.449
...but to the world.

32:08.826 --> 32:12.057
I can't let my father die for my mistakes.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.425
Well, if that's your decision...

32:19.804 --> 32:22.466
...then there's something else
I have to show you.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.841
Activate screen.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.562
It says, "l am waiting."

32:49.467 --> 32:50.764
It must be from Jor-El.

32:50.935 --> 32:54.234
That message didn't come
from the stars.

32:54.405 --> 32:57.670
It originated right here on Earth.

32:58.543 --> 33:00.568
But I believe...

33:02.213 --> 33:05.376
...that it wasn't meant for you, Kal-El.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.674
Dad?

33:41.185 --> 33:42.447
Mom, where's Dad?

33:42.620 --> 33:45.180
He left again, Clark.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.051
Don't be too hard on him.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.284
He can't do what he used to
around here.

33:49.460 --> 33:53.328
Mom, I don't think it's that simple.
I just went to see Dr. Swann.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.259
He thinks Jor-El
is trying to contact someone.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.994
Mom, it's not me,
and the way Dad's been acting...

33:59.170 --> 34:01.229
...I think he's getting
messages through the key.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.135
What would Jor-El want with your dad?

34:03.307 --> 34:07.869
He said Jor-El was waiting for something.
Do you know where Dad went?

34:10.313 --> 34:12.612
-You searched every inch of that farm?
-Yes.

34:12.784 --> 34:16.150
-You're certain?
-Yes, sir, I assure you. It's not there.

34:16.721 --> 34:20.020
Everybody out of here. Get out.
Right now! Get out of here!

34:20.190 --> 34:22.556
Out of here. Now!

34:24.228 --> 34:27.061
-I said, everybody get out of here!
-Go on, get out.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.697
You have no right to be down here.

34:30.868 --> 34:33.735
Well, the State Park Service
might disagree with you.

34:33.905 --> 34:37.670
You want something that doesn't belong
to you. I'm not gonna let you take it.

34:37.875 --> 34:43.541
There exists in this world some things
too valuable to belong to any one person.

34:44.681 --> 34:47.446
I am sick and tired of talking to you.

34:47.618 --> 34:50.985
This is your last warning.
Stay away from my son.

34:51.155 --> 34:54.750
If you raised your son the way I raised mine,
he wouldn't need protection.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.417
You know, weakness isn't
something you're born with.

34:57.595 --> 35:00.962
You learn it,
and Clark learned his from you.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.666
Dad!

36:15.840 --> 36:17.535
Dad!

36:18.376 --> 36:20.571
What are you doing?
You're not thinking!

36:20.745 --> 36:23.270
It's the only way that I know you're safe.

36:26.984 --> 36:32.445
Unless you want to explain to the police
why you illegally raided my farm...

36:33.324 --> 36:36.487
...you had better let me walk out of here.

36:37.395 --> 36:38.987
Back off.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.059
Sir...

36:42.233 --> 36:44.030
...you better take a look at this.

36:59.817 --> 37:02.479
The key's in the wall.

37:04.255 --> 37:05.688
It must be.

37:08.926 --> 37:10.894
Where is it, Clark?

37:12.230 --> 37:14.027
I don't have it.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.510
Hi.

37:43.894 --> 37:46.124
I know you got a lot going on right now.

37:46.297 --> 37:49.664
I think we left things
in kind of a weird place.

37:50.868 --> 37:55.032
I know the way I've been acting
is kind of hard to understand...

37:55.206 --> 37:58.232
...but, Lana, my feelings for you
have never changed.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.907
I guess a part of me knows that.

38:02.079 --> 38:04.240
But, you know, it's like Lex says...

38:04.415 --> 38:07.578
...a person isn't who they say they are
in any one moment.

38:07.752 --> 38:10.346
-They're who they've always been--
-Lex?

38:10.521 --> 38:12.148
What does he have to do with this?

38:12.823 --> 38:17.283
I trust him. I trust his advice.
He only wants what's best for us.

38:17.595 --> 38:22.589
Lana, how many times have we been
standing here avoiding what we both want?

38:23.701 --> 38:26.397
That's because every time
you've let me get close...

38:26.570 --> 38:28.765
...it hurts that much more
when you leave.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.075
You can't keep changing the rules.

38:33.244 --> 38:35.109
I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you.

38:35.279 --> 38:39.113
-But I promise, I'm not leaving this time.
-Maybe I am.

38:41.752 --> 38:44.243
You know what your dad said
about looking back...

38:44.422 --> 38:46.652
...and feeling as though
he'd missed something?

38:47.024 --> 38:50.687
Clark, I have been so focused on you...

38:50.861 --> 38:53.728
...waiting to see if we could
ever get back together...

38:53.898 --> 38:56.765
...that maybe I'm missing out
on some opportunities.

38:58.035 --> 39:02.495
-Like seeing other people?
-No. No, I mean everything.

39:04.909 --> 39:08.640
And until I figure that out,
I can't keep doing this.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.448
It's not fair to either of us.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.217
Clark.

39:56.694 --> 39:59.288
Lana sure didn't stay very long.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.659
No.

40:04.602 --> 40:07.867
-You all right, son?
-Yeah.

40:09.840 --> 40:13.571
Dad, we're going to have to talk
about what happened down in the cave.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.541
I know.

40:16.113 --> 40:20.243
You always tell me to be so careful
around Lionel Luthor, and then you just....

40:20.418 --> 40:25.253
-Why'd you go down there with the key?
-I'm not sure. I was just drawn to it.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.118
It's the only way I can explain it.

40:27.892 --> 40:31.555
Dad, I know it's the deal you made
with Jor-El.

40:32.530 --> 40:36.967
I thought you sacrificed your health to bring
me home, but it's more than that, isn't it?

40:37.501 --> 40:43.337
Clark, look, I've done a lot of things the last
few days I'm not particularly proud of...

40:44.742 --> 40:47.233
...but it wasn't Jor-El who did them,
it was me.

40:52.416 --> 40:54.680
What's Jor-El waiting for?

40:57.721 --> 40:59.279
How do you know about that?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.652
Dr. Swann.

41:02.660 --> 41:06.619
-Dad, what did you promise him?
-That's none of your concern, Clark.

41:07.331 --> 41:11.358
Dad, if it wasn't for me, you never
would've gotten involved with Jor-El.

41:11.535 --> 41:13.901
Come on, why don't you let me help?

41:14.071 --> 41:16.904
I've always told you to take
responsibility for your decisions.

41:17.074 --> 41:18.974
Now let me take responsibility for mine.

41:19.143 --> 41:21.543
Because now we're both
in Lionel's sights...

41:21.712 --> 41:25.307
...and what are we gonna do
when he gets that key out of the wall?

41:26.784 --> 41:29.116
The key is not in the wall, Clark.

41:29.286 --> 41:32.551
-You took it.
-No.

41:33.791 --> 41:38.125
But it's still out there somewhere.

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
