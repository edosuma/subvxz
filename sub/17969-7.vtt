WEBVTT

00:11.044 --> 00:13.285
Incoming flight.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.717
<i>Incoming flight.</i>
Whoa.

00:16.049 --> 00:19.121
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Incoming flight.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.357
What we did was...
Under the circumstances

00:21.522 --> 00:22.899
The work is what's important.
What we did was...

00:23.056 --> 00:24.330
Fine. It's fine.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.163
Yeah.
What we did was biology.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.998
I'm okay, really.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.365
Okay.
<i>Incoming flight.</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:36.538
<i>Incoming flight. Incoming flight.</i>
I'm fine. I'm fine too.

00:37.471 --> 00:41.578
<i>Incoming flight. Incoming flight.</i>
What do you think? Good or bad?

00:41.808 --> 00:44.721
Considering we never got
the call out, probably bad.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.823
Definitely bad.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.096
Military?
No.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.335
My corporate patrons.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.166
Lower your weapons, sir.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.192
Dr. Farragut, isn't it?
It's so nice to finally meet you.

01:25.385 --> 01:26.420
I'm Constance Sutton,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.863
chief operating officer
of the Ilaria Corporation,

01:29.022 --> 01:33.437
parent company of Arctic Biosystems.
I'm here for one reason only.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.629
To help you.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.415
First thing I need
is a working line to the CDC.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.111
Am I to understand that
the communication satellite went down?

01:48.909 --> 01:51.321
Unfortunately,
I don't have a magic telephone.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.491
I'm under the same constraints
as everyone.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.059
What about your helicopters?
They're out of range.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.490
Be back in two days' time.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.426
I'm afraid you're stuck with me
and my boys until then.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.468
Two hours in a helicopter. Ouch.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.659
I'm sorry you had a rough journey.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.169
So, Alan, how goes the search
for a cure?

02:11.398 --> 02:12.638
Slowly.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.177
Hence, the fact
that I'm here wearing combat boots.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.575
But ifs time for us
to create a new paradigm

02:17.771 --> 02:19.580
between our corporation
and the CDC.

02:19.773 --> 02:23.653
What do you need from ilaria
to contain this terrible disease?

02:24.311 --> 02:29.624
An integral member of my team, Dr.
Walker, is trapped down on Level R.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.352
I need her back.
Impossible.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.587
Dr. Hatake, please.
Let's square the circle.

02:34.287 --> 02:38.133
Dr. Walker, why is she locked up?
She's infected.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.832
I'm so sorry.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.475
She's an expert in RNA structure.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.343
And that's important because?
RNA carries the message.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.949
We store the instructions
for the cure in the DNA

02:53.373 --> 02:55.046
and then the RNA passes it on.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.812
That makes her the most
important member of my team.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.627
Well, ilaria is about value-add.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.992
If Dr. Walker is what you need,
Dr. Walker is what you will get.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.056
Lt. Klein, let's prepare a plan
to retrieve Dr. Walker.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.696
Yes, ma'am.
Alan, one thing.

03:11.858 --> 03:15.829
One thing only, a cure. Please.

03:17.731 --> 03:21.144
Now, Dr. Hatake,
may we have a word?

03:22.302 --> 03:24.304
In private, if you don't mind.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.091
Constance.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.098
Hiroshi.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.737
Two things, Hiroshi!
Two simple things.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.281
That's all we needed.
I created your virus.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.543
Where is the cure?

04:03.276 --> 04:05.756
Virus and cure.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.758
One without the other is meaningless.
We don't wanna kill everybody

04:09.950 --> 04:13.625
just thin the herd a bit.
And rule them.

04:14.121 --> 04:17.034
It's time.
We've waited long enough.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.028
You know that.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.905
There have been a few setbacks.
You failed.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.737
Thank God, the CDC arrived
to do your job for you.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.781
For you.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.109
Hm.

04:32.806 --> 04:37.084
What is this other strain
I'm hearing about?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.883
Narvik-B,
the one that turns people into...

04:40.080 --> 04:44.551
An alternate attempt at the virus.
Why?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.998
The cure has been elusive
in the A strain.

04:49.389 --> 04:54.498
Perhaps the B strain...
Perhaps you are full of shit, Hiroshi.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.939
It's the Willis Hypothesis.
We said no then. Nothing has changed.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.647
Virus and cure. Simple.

05:05.272 --> 05:08.412
Do you really plan
to go down to Level R?

05:09.109 --> 05:11.783
To get this Walker? Yes.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.323
If Dr. Farragut needs her,
he gels her.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.858
The cure is in his hands now.
And then?

05:17.083 --> 05:20.621
And then we follow normal
null protocol, no witnesses.

05:21.755 --> 05:26.033
These people are my employees,
my responsibility.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.331
No one gets out alive, Hiroshi.
You knew that before we started.

05:31.264 --> 05:35.371
What about the CDC?
If they fail to return?

05:35.602 --> 05:38.446
We have people in place
to control such things.

05:41.641 --> 05:47.148
And if I find out
that you betrayed us...

05:50.350 --> 05:53.490
the only thing left of you,
or this facility

05:53.687 --> 05:57.658
will be a blackened scar on the ice.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.067
Now say it.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.632
Say it.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.409
No one gets out alive.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.333
Aw! Come on! Please?

06:29.522 --> 06:32.526
Begging? Thought you
military guys were tough.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.173
Just one hand even, so I can hold on.
No.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.105
How much farther?
Far.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.835
"Far" Are you mocking me?

06:42.002 --> 06:44.505
Would you prefer I sang
"One Hundred Bottles of Beer"?

06:44.671 --> 06:47.242
I'd rather you shut your mouth.
Well, then untie me

06:47.407 --> 06:50.581
and I promise you won't hear a word.
Or I could just speed up,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.452
you fall off, and then
I won't have to hear you yapping.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.422
I like my plan better.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.710
We need to talk.
About... About Sutton.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.252
What about her?

07:31.718 --> 07:33.629
I don't think
she's telling us everything.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.789
Not with what Hatake's
put us through.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.758
What do you mean?
What I mean

07:38.258 --> 07:41.398
is I don't think
our agenda is her agenda.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.168
Right.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.910
Where's the profit in sending Sutton
and her private army here?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.638
Especially when we're cleaning up
their mess for free.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.976
Big pharma.
Only interested in the bottom line.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.846
They don't wanna help people.
Who knows how far they'll go

07:55.008 --> 07:56.851
to protect their investment?

07:57.010 --> 08:01.152
We can't stop working on a cure.
No, too many lives at stake.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.591
But we do not work for Sutton.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.297
We keep the cure from her.

08:10.690 --> 08:11.998
We may need it.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.460
Unh!

09:23.063 --> 09:24.337
Unh!

09:34.908 --> 09:37.684
<i>Cafeteria is now open.</i>

09:37.844 --> 09:39.721
<i>Cafeteria is now open.</i>

09:39.879 --> 09:41.415
Daniel.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.591
Hatake's adopted son.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.190
Though on some level you do realize
that we pay your salary, yes?

09:49.556 --> 09:54.437
So you've already bought me.
Paid for excellent service, rather.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.932
Did you have a chance
to meet this Dr. Walker?

09:57.130 --> 10:00.577
Yeah.
I'm feeling some pushback, Daniel,

10:00.733 --> 10:04.408
and I'm extremely busy, so I need
a quick win on this one, okay?

10:04.604 --> 10:05.810
Okay.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.077
I need full intel on Walker before
I return her to Dr. Farragut,

10:09.275 --> 10:12.950
and, well, let's be honest, Hiroshi
is not gonna tell me anything.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.220
There's not much to tell.
Heh, heh.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.420
I like you, Daniel,

10:19.619 --> 10:23.396
and I don't want to start our
relationship with you lying to me.

10:23.590 --> 10:26.002
I wasn't aware
that we had a relationship.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.435
Hm.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.804
Loyalty, I understand.
Hell, I even admire it.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.948
So let's skip the negatives
and get straight to the positives.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.519
You are very good at your job.

10:43.676 --> 10:47.021
And Hatake is not gonna be
in charge of this place forever.

10:49.115 --> 10:53.086
Just think on it, Daniel. Please.

10:54.521 --> 10:58.628
Hiroshi has destroyed everyone
who's ever been close to him.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.668
Don't let him do the same to you.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.616
Handy.

11:18.811 --> 11:22.281
The U.S. military abandoned 67
of these early-warning stations

11:22.482 --> 11:26.055
across the Arctic.
Someone should put them to use.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.192
How about untying my hands?

11:32.625 --> 11:36.038
You need your hands to sleep?
You've got the gun.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.975
Yeah, you make a good point.

11:40.066 --> 11:44.208
I'm just saying,
let's be reasonable.

11:46.673 --> 11:47.708
Okay.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.018
Okay.

11:54.847 --> 11:58.351
I think it's reasonable to hogtie you.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.096
Make sure you don't get any ideas
about running off.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.756
Come on!

12:04.023 --> 12:06.560
I need to get back upstairs.
I need to get to Alan.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.864
My blood could have antibodies.
There's a guy in Australia.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.905
His blood plasma
saved 2 million babies.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.600
We only have to save 40 or 50 people.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.112
This would be so much easier
if you were real.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.917
I'm better than nothing.
Barely.

12:29.782 --> 12:32.194
Are you connected to my silver eyes?

12:32.585 --> 12:36.465
Is that why I'm seeing you?
Is that your hypothesis?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.631
You know I've always hated
the Socratic method.

12:40.026 --> 12:44.736
Fine. Maybe it's temporary
light sensitivity.

12:45.031 --> 12:48.205
Or non-episodic cluster headaches.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.408
Maybe you're just going blind.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.077
Better than dead, I guess.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.580
Or maybe...

13:04.284 --> 13:06.890
Maybe you're survivor zero.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.066
The first one cured.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.297
But if I'm cured,
why am I still hallucinating?

13:16.996 --> 13:19.806
I have an even better question.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.347
Why are you hallucinating me

13:23.569 --> 13:25.344
instead of Alan?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.699
Sutton is trying
to turn me against you.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.105
Of course she is.

13:56.803 --> 14:01.047
Just wanted to let you know.
Sutton can be a dangerous enemy.

14:04.877 --> 14:05.947
I understand.

14:06.979 --> 14:10.153
No. You don't.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.989
She destroys anything
that gets in her way.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.358
She said something similar
about you.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.700
What is it you want from me?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.304
Your trust.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.214
I'm trying to protect you.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.313
But there is one thing you can do.

14:36.409 --> 14:41.859
Under no circumstances can Sutton
be allowed to gain access to Dr. Walker.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.695
Why is Walker so important?

14:46.886 --> 14:47.990
Is it about the cure?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.665
I never cared about the cure.
But I thought that's why...

14:51.858 --> 14:54.168
Is it not enough
that I asked for your help?

14:57.930 --> 15:01.377
I think Sutton will kill Walker.

15:03.870 --> 15:07.511
I do not wish that outcome.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.311
You should get closer to the heater.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.888
Are you really gonna sleep?
That's what tired people do.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.999
Jeez, you can't even speak
Spanish correctly.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.568
That's because it's Portuguese.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.338
See? Horrible Spanish.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.264
Heh.

16:05.298 --> 16:10.270
Where's your home?
Espírito Santo. Just north of Rio.

16:13.072 --> 16:17.578
I really am sorry.
You know, about the missing kids.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.588
As a child, we were warned
to stay near the hunting camps.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.164
Otherwise,
the Qalupalik would take us.

16:29.355 --> 16:34.464
Qalu-who?
The Boogeyman. Child-stealer.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.465
But I grew up and discovered
my Boogeyman was real.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.339
Mine too.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.110
A lot of kids go missing
in Espírito Santo?

16:45.538 --> 16:47.040
Yeah.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.550
Ugh.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.520
Fine.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.895
I don't like you.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.073
But I'm sorry
about whatever you went through.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.029
Dr. Farragut.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.430
Ms. Sutton.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.239
Please, call me Constance.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.503
So how is the search
for the cure progressing?

17:47.700 --> 17:50.840
It isn't, without Dr. Walker.
I thought we had an understanding.

17:51.003 --> 17:54.007
You take care of the lab work,
I'll take care of everything else.

17:54.206 --> 17:57.881
I'm afraid you didn't square the circle
on that one, Constance.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.592
Plans are in motion.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.095
My security team will be going down
to retrieve Dr. Walker very soon.

18:08.287 --> 18:09.732
And I'll be going with them.

18:09.889 --> 18:13.359
I'm afraid that's a non-starter. We
can't allow anything to happen to you.

18:13.559 --> 18:17.200
Dr. Walker is a member of my team.
I need to guarantee her safety.

18:17.697 --> 18:21.611
I'm sensing you have some trust issues.
If I don't go, no one goes.

18:23.536 --> 18:27.416
Suit yourself. But you will have
an armed escort at all times.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.245
I wouldn't have it any other way.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.814
Hm.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.595
Perimeter alert.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.066
<i>Perimeter alert.</i>

18:48.427 --> 18:50.100
<i>Perimeter al...</i>

19:16.622 --> 19:18.033
Miksa.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.632
The hell are you doing here?
You mean alive?

19:24.196 --> 19:25.266
Miksa.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.846
You even feel like him.

19:29.969 --> 19:33.815
Who the hell are you?
He says you think your name is Daniel.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.216
Your name is Miksa.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.549
You were taken from us as a child.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.725
Listen,
I don't know who you think I am.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.518
I've been searching for you
my entire life.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.458
My brother.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.530
What is this?
What are you trying to pull?

19:48.721 --> 19:52.032
Don't look at me. She's got another
one exactly like you back home.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.669
Your brother, your twin.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.470
Tulok.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.151
Impressive. But I can use Photoshop too.
Take him to isolation.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.997
I'll deal with her.

20:21.187 --> 20:25.158
<i>Attention. Code 157, Level G.</i>

20:34.066 --> 20:37.513
...two, three, four.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.877
Four steps to the table.

20:41.073 --> 20:45.715
One, two, three steps to the cabinet.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.049
Ah!

20:47.580 --> 20:51.756
One step to the cart.
Gotta remember that.

20:59.425 --> 21:03.464
Dr. Hatake? Is that you?

21:05.030 --> 21:06.407
Peter?

22:27.646 --> 22:30.149
Nice to see
you've made yourself at home.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.124
Hiroshi, who is Julia Walker?

22:34.653 --> 22:36.690
Why haven't you mentioned her?
Why would I?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.836
Well, you briefed us
on that poor dead veterinarian, Doreen...

22:40.025 --> 22:42.198
Walker seemed unimportant.

22:42.962 --> 22:47.035
Dr. Farragut seems to think
she's the exact opposite of unimportant.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.805
She's his ex-wife.

22:50.002 --> 22:54.007
Ah. Nepotism. Is that his reasoning?
Perhaps.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.751
And what is yours?

23:03.682 --> 23:05.184
Recruiting.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.525
I have files on all CDC scientists.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.928
So she is important.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.361
I chose not to recruit her,
so, no, I don't believe so.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.837
A difference of opinion then.
Good.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.102
Human Resources problems
I can understand.

23:23.202 --> 23:27.514
I'll tell you what, Hiroshi, I will
personally arbitrate Dr. Walker's importance

23:27.706 --> 23:31.347
or lack thereof, when I go down
to Level R and pull her out.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.921
Where is she?

23:35.447 --> 23:39.190
She's in a lab we set up for triage.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.757
R-17.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.437
Hiroshi.

23:52.631 --> 23:55.441
Let's not forget which side you're on.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.884
Access granted.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.325
Ever use one of these?

24:18.424 --> 24:20.131
Recently.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.470
Dr. Farragut.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.146
You wanna come with us?
Take the gun.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.649
<i>Scheduled cleaning, Level B.</i>

24:35.908 --> 24:38.013
<i>Scheduled cleaning, Level B.</i>

24:39.812 --> 24:41.758
Do you really think
you can trust them?

24:41.947 --> 24:46.862
No, but you saw what happened
when we went down there alone.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.622
All these guns around.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.495
Might as well use them
to get what we want.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.605
Go get Julia, please,
so that we can all go home.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.032
Balleseros.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.678
Dr. Farragut.

25:05.170 --> 25:09.209
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Dr. Farragut. Please. Slop it.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.321
That man killed Dr. Boyle.

25:12.378 --> 25:16.190
The Army en...
You killed a member of the CDC

25:16.382 --> 25:19.226
who was trying to find a cure
for this virus?

25:19.451 --> 25:21.692
I promise you, I will make this man pay.

25:21.887 --> 25:25.460
You have neither the time nor the
wherewithal to handle this right now. I do.

25:25.624 --> 25:28.366
This is not your concern.
No, but if my men handle this,

25:28.527 --> 25:32.475
that puts you back in the lab faster,
and that is very much my concern.

25:53.318 --> 25:56.993
Give me a minute with the prisoner.
Get ready for insertion and retrieval.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.828
Ma'am.
Dismissed.

26:19.845 --> 26:22.553
Shit. What was that for?

26:23.849 --> 26:27.956
You murdered 25 percent of the
workflow we need for the cure.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.293
How about I kill 25 percent of you?

26:31.523 --> 26:34.561
Come on, Constance.
Ms. Sutton.

26:37.930 --> 26:41.639
What am I paying you for?
Virus. Cure.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.111
Wrong. That is what ilaria pays you for.
I, on the other hand,

26:45.304 --> 26:49.810
tasked you with finding me proof
that Hatake has gone off the rails.

26:49.975 --> 26:52.649
Last time you checked in,
you were on to something.

26:52.811 --> 26:55.917
Sorry to disappoint you.
I've been busy trying not to get killed.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.721
So you have nothing,
except excuses.

26:58.884 --> 27:03.890
And a perforated spleen.
You created the Hatake situation.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.969
Don't you blame me for your mess.

27:07.926 --> 27:10.406
That's why I like you, Serge.

27:11.263 --> 27:16.770
You're either very brave
or very, very foolish.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.448
Apparently both.

27:19.104 --> 27:20.242
Unh!

27:35.087 --> 27:37.294
A brave fool is still a fool.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.463
Unh.

27:57.009 --> 28:01.116
So are you gonna take these off,
or am I still in a time-out?

28:02.681 --> 28:04.683
I need Alan as an ally.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.456
Releasing you will be the
quickest way to screw that up.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.826
You're kidding, right?

28:09.988 --> 28:11.023
Do I ever kid?

28:12.991 --> 28:15.198
So I stay?
So you stay.

28:15.894 --> 28:20.240
Plus, I'm not sure you would survive an
encounter with that Daniel character.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.504
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.641
Oh, now, if I were you,

28:24.803 --> 28:29.980
I would think that my soft kisses

28:32.477 --> 28:34.184
are all the vote I needed.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.083
Lt. Klein.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.353
Throw him in isolation.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.774
Access granted.

28:58.704 --> 28:59.876
Dr. Walker.

29:00.939 --> 29:03.681
Where were you?
What happened here?

29:07.045 --> 29:10.515
Was it the other scientists?
No, a vector.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.592
Are you hurt?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.925
It was here, in front of me,
ready to attack,

29:16.088 --> 29:21.037
and then it just...
And then it just stopped.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.697
Dr. Walker, you look better.

29:26.064 --> 29:29.876
Alive. Healthy. Possibly going crazy.
All of the above.

29:30.736 --> 29:31.771
This is wonderful.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.543
Yeah, except for the crazy part.
Could do without that.

29:34.706 --> 29:38.051
I'll need to draw blood.
Run diagnostic tests.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.713
I've done all the tests.
There's no sign of the virus.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.415
The only thing... Ow!

29:42.581 --> 29:46.825
Unh! My eyes hurt. There's
something happening to my eyes.

29:46.985 --> 29:48.430
Everything's blurry-

29:57.229 --> 29:58.970
Sit here.

30:01.933 --> 30:04.277
Let me get you some bandages.

30:20.118 --> 30:21.529
Close your eyes.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.279
Are you okay?

30:55.620 --> 30:57.497
<i>Level E.</i>

31:00.392 --> 31:03.862
My sit-reps indicate
these vectors are fast and strong?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.805
Level <i>F.</i>
Like nothing you've ever seen.

31:06.965 --> 31:09.878
And the others?
Human.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.710
Suffering prolonged and fatal cellular
breakdown due to the Narvik-A strain.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.476
<i>Level</i> E.
Or not suffering at all.

31:16.007 --> 31:19.477
You said there were healthy people?
There were.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.885
Now I don't know.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.821
<i>Level R.</i>

31:28.653 --> 31:30.655
Red, take point.
Yes, sir.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.498
- Quarters.
- Clear.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.107
Clear.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.107
Lab R-17?
This way, I think.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.547
You heard the man. Let's go.
Roger that.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.919
Can you walk?

31:56.081 --> 31:59.255
Yes. Why?

31:59.451 --> 32:02.125
We need to leave this place.
Why?

32:02.287 --> 32:05.029
There is a woman
coming down here to kill you.

32:05.190 --> 32:06.601
What are you talking about?

32:07.426 --> 32:11.602
I'll explain everything,
but right now, we need to leave.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.934
Does Alan know about this?
He's coming down with her.

32:15.100 --> 32:19.105
Alan would never...
He doesn't know what she's capable of.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.807
I do.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.914
You have to come with me.
No. I wanna wait for Alan.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.283
If you do

32:28.914 --> 32:30.120
you'll die.

32:31.249 --> 32:34.093
You have to trust me.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.731
Julia...

32:41.760 --> 32:43.467
please.

32:53.138 --> 32:54.674
Okay.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.192
Access granted.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.199
Alan, wait a moment.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.940
Make entry.
Single shots, no bursts.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.979
Dr. Walkers precious cargo.
On my mark.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.054
Ready. Breach.

33:35.046 --> 33:36.821
Look out!

33:56.334 --> 33:57.813
Behind us.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.165
Full retreat! Let's go! Go!

34:18.223 --> 34:20.260
Fall back!

34:24.329 --> 34:26.172
- Radcliffe's down.
- Leave him.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.284
I have to find Julia.

34:41.545 --> 34:43.856
If she's not in there,
she's one of them now.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.289
I'm not leaving her here.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.598
How is getting yourself infected
or killed gonna help her?

34:48.753 --> 34:50.733
I don't know,
but I can't leave her behind.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.391
We have to get back upstairs.

34:52.556 --> 34:56.027
We come back down with more security.
Otherwise we're sitting ducks.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.785
I'm going to find Julia.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.891
You still don't understand
how this works.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.785
Get to the elevator.
I just saved your life.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.262
And I'm extremely appreciative,
but I have to protect my investment.

35:23.588 --> 35:26.398
By putting a bullet through it?

35:26.558 --> 35:28.595
Go ahead.
If ifs the difference between

35:28.760 --> 35:32.003
shooting you now or when
you're one of them, then fine.

35:32.163 --> 35:35.508
Although I will need to put a bullet
through young Sarah as well.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.339
Loose ends.

35:42.507 --> 35:45.852
Let's escort Dr. Farragut
back up to Level B, please, Lt. Klein?

35:46.011 --> 35:48.082
Yes, ma'am.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.261
Why here?
No cameras.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.832
Father took that.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.975
Father?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.938
He's dead. Mother too.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.812
And what did you call me?
Miksa.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.647
It was our grandfather's name.

36:29.454 --> 36:30.797
And why should I believe you?

36:31.890 --> 36:35.565
Any of this?
Why would I lie?

36:35.727 --> 36:39.573
Dr. Hatake has many enemies.
Hatake?

36:40.165 --> 36:41.644
He's responsible.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.974
He's the one that stole you,
along with the others.

36:45.303 --> 36:49.479
The others?
Thirty-one children over the years.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.880
Do you remember any of them?

36:56.314 --> 36:58.521
There were always children here.

37:00.685 --> 37:02.722
I thought it was normal.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.197
What happened to them?

37:09.094 --> 37:10.732
I don't know.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.938
Maybe you didn't wanna know.

37:29.781 --> 37:33.024
Where are we?
Upstairs.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.420
You are safe.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.199
Daniel?

37:45.630 --> 37:48.577
What's the meaning of this?
Don't.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.940
Just don't.

37:51.102 --> 37:55.244
And you are?
His sister.

37:55.974 --> 37:59.387
The one you left behind
when you stole him from his family.

38:03.648 --> 38:07.118
Dr. Walker, these men will
escort you back to the lab.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.460
Take these. You'll need them.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.129
Go. You'll be fine.
What about you?

38:17.295 --> 38:20.174
I'm not sure.

38:26.604 --> 38:27.947
Dr. Walker.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.143
Julia!

38:30.475 --> 38:34.582
- I'm...
- Get her out of here.

38:47.592 --> 38:50.971
The floor is secured for now.
We should be safe up here.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.102
<i>Level B.</i>

38:53.998 --> 38:55.033
<i>Elevator locked.</i>

38:55.200 --> 38:57.612
I sacrificed my own men for you.
Now it's your turn.

38:57.769 --> 39:00.147
Run along and find me that cure.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.444
Well, what about Dr. Walker?
Oh, Alan.

39:03.107 --> 39:05.280
She's one of those things now,
or dead.

39:06.544 --> 39:08.546
I don't know which is worse.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.572
Oh, my God.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.102
Jules.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.212
Jules.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.778
What are you doing here?
I thought you were...

40:18.116 --> 40:20.392
Look at you.
Your symptoms are gone.

40:21.085 --> 40:25.261
I'm cured. At least, I...
I mean, I think I am.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.869
How?
I don't know.

40:54.485 --> 40:56.226
Look at me.
