00:23.919 --> 00:27.389
It has to dry, then it needs
more lime and color.

00:28.123 --> 00:30.726
It will take time,
but we can do it.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.429
I want it ready for
the procession of the flagellants.

00:42.304 --> 00:44.406
It has to look like this.

00:49.511 --> 00:50.578
The Holy Virgin...

00:51.546 --> 00:53.348
must have this face.

00:54.516 --> 00:56.985
Of course, Don Salvatore.

01:30.917 --> 01:34.688
<i>I would go mad
without you</i>

01:34.955 --> 01:37.424
<i>Without your touch
what would I do?</i>

01:38.325 --> 01:42.128
<i>The fires of hell
I would go through</i>

01:42.295 --> 01:44.697
<i>Because you can die for love</i>

01:44.898 --> 01:46.499
<i>Never...</i>

01:47.500 --> 01:49.502
<i>My heart never</i>

01:50.203 --> 01:52.004
There's someone at the door, I'll go.

01:52.205 --> 01:55.374
- Stop, it's for me!
- Her boyfriend's here!

02:05.700 --> 02:07.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:09.555 --> 02:11.557
- Good afternoon, Don Salvatore.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.559
Oh, by the way,

02:13.759 --> 02:15.194
thanks a lot,

02:15.360 --> 02:18.764
I still have to figure it out,
but it's great.

02:18.964 --> 02:19.965
It's nothing.

02:20.165 --> 02:21.533
- My hands are covered in flour.
- No matter.

02:21.733 --> 02:22.933
It makes mojitos!

02:23.268 --> 02:24.870
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

02:25.070 --> 02:26.304
Salvatore doesn't drink,

02:26.505 --> 02:28.907
smoke or make love,
he likes penitence.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.142
That's why he chose you!

03:41.944 --> 03:43.345
Outta the way.

03:43.512 --> 03:45.314
Give me a hand.

04:11.473 --> 04:12.507
Good.

04:12.674 --> 04:13.975
Thank you, Don Salvatore.

04:17.011 --> 04:19.213
Don Salvatore, could I speak to you?

04:20.113 --> 04:22.517
It's my son's baptism soon.

04:22.717 --> 04:24.152
Congratulations!

04:24.318 --> 04:26.721
Would you honor me
and be his godfather?

04:28.522 --> 04:30.324
No problem!

04:30.725 --> 04:32.526
Thank you, Don Salvatore.

05:04.324 --> 05:05.725
This is it!

05:07.694 --> 05:09.362
The money from the secessionists.

05:16.002 --> 05:18.671
How much do we get from ten kilos?

05:18.904 --> 05:20.373
You make them 30

05:21.140 --> 05:24.143
for a street value
of 2.5 million, right?

05:26.345 --> 05:28.948
These idiots can't even make two.

05:29.782 --> 05:33.385
What can you do, Don Salvatore?
They're incompetent!

05:33.552 --> 05:35.954
They say they pay too much
for the stuff...

05:37.522 --> 05:40.125
They don't know how to work.

05:40.325 --> 05:42.928
We gave a lantern to blind people.

05:54.739 --> 05:56.341
Take it to them.

06:18.529 --> 06:20.731
- Who are you looking for?
- Your ma!

07:32.367 --> 07:34.569
Crack a smile, can't you?

07:59.793 --> 08:01.362
Don Salvatore!

08:03.397 --> 08:05.199
Thank you for coming.

08:05.399 --> 08:06.600
My wife.

08:07.634 --> 08:09.436
Don Salvatore, a pleasure.

08:10.137 --> 08:12.205
- The godmother.
- A pleasure.

08:12.773 --> 08:14.174
Don Salvatore...

08:15.775 --> 08:17.744
Please, go along inside.

08:20.246 --> 08:22.048
Excuse me, may I have a word?

08:22.248 --> 08:23.850
There's a problem?

08:24.050 --> 08:26.853
No, not for the baptism,
not at all.

08:27.554 --> 08:29.155
But, you see...

08:30.957 --> 08:33.960
They're dealing right here...

08:34.559 --> 08:36.562
There's a limit to everything.

08:37.363 --> 08:39.765
Drugs are pushed freely here,

08:39.966 --> 08:44.169
the junkies shoot up
in the soccer field.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.373
I find hundreds of needles every day.

08:49.842 --> 08:51.844
Father Alfonso, you're right.

08:53.746 --> 08:55.647
It's a disgrace.

08:55.848 --> 08:57.849
This is the Lord's house.

08:58.383 --> 09:01.153
Speak out and something will happen.

09:01.353 --> 09:03.155
A demonstration,

09:03.355 --> 09:04.956
a torchlight procession...

09:07.359 --> 09:09.361
I gotta tell you what to do?

09:09.561 --> 09:10.962
- No.
- No.

09:11.730 --> 09:12.797
Well, then...

09:28.750 --> 09:30.352
Guys, take it easy!

09:32.520 --> 09:34.322
Take it easy!

09:39.761 --> 09:41.562
Some wine!

09:42.296 --> 09:44.966
Roll a joint!

09:47.235 --> 09:49.503
Just two bottles? Get five or six!

09:56.677 --> 09:58.078
Cops!

10:05.853 --> 10:08.288
Gennarino, what's going on?

10:08.488 --> 10:09.957
The cops are here.

10:10.157 --> 10:11.558
Come and see!

10:18.098 --> 10:20.133
NO TO DRUGS

10:20.300 --> 10:21.701
Get out!

10:32.111 --> 10:33.713
Hurray for drugs!

10:33.913 --> 10:36.516
- Get out of here!
- Get lost!

10:40.086 --> 10:42.321
What's gotten
into this shitty priest?

10:42.488 --> 10:44.123
What do we do with that fuck?

10:46.892 --> 10:48.294
What do we do, Gypsy?

10:48.494 --> 10:51.297
Nothin', you gotta stay
calm and quiet.

11:02.774 --> 11:04.576
We can't do a thing.

11:07.746 --> 11:10.348
We can't make war against priests,

11:11.383 --> 11:13.852
we gotta close the Monterosa
dealing spot.

11:14.052 --> 11:16.654
- But that's mine!
- I know.

11:17.422 --> 11:19.224
What can we do?

11:19.924 --> 11:21.726
The Church is the Church.

11:21.926 --> 11:25.530
What the fuck do you mean
"what can we do"?

11:25.730 --> 11:28.733
There were just
four idiots with torches.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.901
Can we be scared by a gutless asshole

11:31.102 --> 11:32.703
who couldn't look us in the face
'til now?

11:32.903 --> 11:34.705
It's not just the priest.

11:40.544 --> 11:42.546
The Bishop's behind him

11:43.447 --> 11:45.449
and we can't fool with the Church.

11:47.551 --> 11:49.119
Don't worry,

11:49.820 --> 11:52.889
we'll find a solution
to open another dealing spot.

11:53.090 --> 11:56.493
For now, each of us
gives some money to Gypsy.

12:00.330 --> 12:02.132
We're a family, aren't we?

12:02.332 --> 12:04.334
Salvatore,
we can't survive like this.

12:04.567 --> 12:08.671
He's right,
I'm killin' myself to pay you.

12:10.506 --> 12:12.508
What am I supposed to do?

12:12.709 --> 12:15.111
If this is a democratic alliance,

12:15.344 --> 12:17.947
we should all buy the stuff together,
at the same price.

12:18.147 --> 12:20.750
Now we get it from you,
and you pay less,

12:20.916 --> 12:23.419
so you earn twice:
with us and your spots!

12:23.619 --> 12:26.222
Who's forcing you to buy from me?

12:27.256 --> 12:29.058
I'm not Savastano.

12:30.326 --> 12:32.528
Buy where you like.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.967
Let's just see
if you can find it for less!

12:39.167 --> 12:40.469
But that's not the point.

12:41.336 --> 12:42.938
You're free.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.141
Free will, free market...
we're all free.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.876
That's capitalism.

12:48.043 --> 12:49.844
Salvatore's right.

12:52.947 --> 12:55.116
We made an agreement,

12:55.350 --> 12:57.118
agreements have to be respected.

12:58.853 --> 13:00.955
And this priest thing too...

13:01.122 --> 13:03.725
We can't go against the Church!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.935
- Everything's okay?
- Okay.

13:16.137 --> 13:17.938
Take care.

13:30.717 --> 13:33.120
Ciro, whose side are you on?

13:35.922 --> 13:37.724
Our side.

13:39.326 --> 13:42.128
You don't get his game, do you?

13:42.329 --> 13:44.731
He wants to shove it
up our asses.

13:45.298 --> 13:48.301
He got rid of Savastano
and now we're the problem.

13:48.501 --> 13:50.503
We don't argue,

13:50.737 --> 13:53.139
not about the stuff or the priest,
no arguing.

13:53.606 --> 13:56.008
He hopes we'll do somethin' stupid.

13:58.177 --> 13:59.979
What can we do?

14:01.580 --> 14:03.182
We gotta wait.

14:03.783 --> 14:06.385
Wait for him to screw up.

14:22.934 --> 14:25.537
Don Salvatore, if I may,

14:25.737 --> 14:28.139
this dealing spot business
is no good, it brings trouble.

14:28.340 --> 14:31.343
Did you see their faces?
They're pissed off.

14:31.509 --> 14:33.144
Great,

14:33.378 --> 14:35.180
I'm fuckin' fed up.

14:35.346 --> 14:38.950
I'm sick of losing money
with those idiots.

14:39.551 --> 14:42.453
The first head to pop up

14:42.654 --> 14:43.721
gets it chopped off.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.091
And the first to roll

14:47.758 --> 14:50.561
is the head of that piece of shit
Ciro di Marzio.

14:51.195 --> 14:52.997
We know him well,

14:53.197 --> 14:54.999
he can't be trusted.

15:37.173 --> 15:41.577
<i>More than magic, without any logic</i>

15:42.278 --> 15:44.280
<i>We met tonight</i>

15:45.981 --> 15:50.552
<i>You're magnetic and lunatic</i>

15:51.787 --> 15:54.189
<i>You fire up my heart</i>

15:55.290 --> 15:58.560
<i>Let me feel a thrill</i>

15:58.760 --> 16:00.762
<i>Hurry up, undress</i>

16:00.963 --> 16:03.565
<i>I want you tonight</i>

16:04.499 --> 16:07.569
<i>Kiss me slow tonight</i>

16:07.802 --> 16:09.504
<i>Squeeze me nice and tight</i>

16:09.671 --> 16:12.507
<i>I already feel lost in you</i>

16:14.008 --> 16:17.278
<i>No thinking, c'mon, let's make love</i>

16:18.780 --> 16:23.184
<i>Feel my beating heart</i>

16:23.351 --> 16:24.852
<i>Don't make me wait</i>

16:25.052 --> 16:28.122
<i>Because time flies, flies</i>

16:28.322 --> 16:30.324
<i>And you</i>

16:30.524 --> 16:33.928
<i>Are crazy for this music</i>

16:34.962 --> 16:37.965
<i>That wants us to fall in love</i>

16:47.774 --> 16:49.776
It's your bithday in a few days,

16:49.977 --> 16:51.778
I have to give you a nice present.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.247
Right.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.550
What present?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.585
It's a surprise.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.756
I'm the one who gives you presents...

17:04.156 --> 17:06.859
Isn't there anything you'd like?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.376
Are you sure?

17:28.446 --> 17:29.848
Yes.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.098
Really sure?

17:59.978 --> 18:01.379
Nina...

18:02.213 --> 18:04.015
you'll drive me mad.

18:11.088 --> 18:12.657
What harm is it?

18:42.052 --> 18:43.486
Cover up,

18:44.087 --> 18:46.489
you'll catch cold
and lose your voice.

19:26.061 --> 19:28.463
- Now what?
- Now...

19:29.998 --> 19:31.766
They gotta see us together.

19:43.578 --> 19:45.379
See you tomorrow.

20:02.463 --> 20:04.865
When you don't come here,
what do you eat?

20:05.799 --> 20:08.368
I stay light for when I come to you.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.873
That's a pretty statue
you brought me.

20:13.073 --> 20:15.475
Like it? I'm glad.

20:16.276 --> 20:18.478
It comes from South America.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.997
- What's wrong, are you done?
- I have to go, Mom.

20:38.598 --> 20:40.600
You're almost skin and bones.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.301
It's late.

20:46.071 --> 20:49.008
Tell me when you'll bring me
a nice girl.

20:49.174 --> 20:51.577
I brought one, see how pretty she is!

20:51.777 --> 20:53.579
Don't tease me.

20:53.779 --> 20:55.180
Mom...

20:56.582 --> 20:59.184
You're the only woman in my life.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.786
That's not true,

21:00.986 --> 21:04.589
I know you're seeing
a girl from the "Blue houses".

21:06.258 --> 21:07.659
How do you know that?

21:09.461 --> 21:12.063
People like to talk.

21:12.497 --> 21:13.498
And so?

21:13.698 --> 21:16.701
You won't be celebrating
your birthday alone this year.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.371
When can I meet her?

21:22.674 --> 21:25.076
When I'm sure it's serious.

21:28.379 --> 21:30.581
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.766
Father Alfonso, you've given
a signal of strength and courage,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.969
you've shown
that change is possible,

21:52.169 --> 21:54.771
will there be more demonstrations?

21:56.339 --> 21:57.741
Well...

21:58.508 --> 22:00.310
We're thinking about it.

22:01.011 --> 22:03.013
So, you're not going to stop?

22:04.414 --> 22:08.418
If we listen to
our consciences and hearts,

22:10.086 --> 22:12.088
we can find courage

22:12.622 --> 22:15.024
and with a little courage

22:16.659 --> 22:20.663
even the hardest things
are possible.

22:22.665 --> 22:24.633
So, my answer is:

22:24.834 --> 22:27.036
no, we won't stop.

22:35.043 --> 22:37.045
Tonino, will you buy the gift?

22:38.313 --> 22:40.816
But don't exaggerate.

22:41.016 --> 22:44.286
Nothing vulgar, something classy.

22:44.486 --> 22:47.989
- Azmera will buy it for the girl.
- She gets a gift too?

22:48.156 --> 22:49.858
We've never even seen her!

22:50.058 --> 22:51.459
Of course!

22:51.660 --> 22:54.262
He's introducing her,
that's why we do it.

22:55.497 --> 22:58.900
Anyway, everyone's coming tonight,
Ciro too.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.003
He did right to invite them,
they're all pissed off.

23:02.203 --> 23:04.005
They gotta put up with it.

23:04.205 --> 23:06.007
If you rule, you make enemies,

23:06.207 --> 23:08.409
if all you have is friends,
you're a poor jerk.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.862
I gave it a shot, taste.

23:32.866 --> 23:34.668
One to two?

23:35.268 --> 23:36.336
One to three.

23:36.536 --> 23:38.939
One to three? You're an ace!

23:39.139 --> 23:40.740
I know, Totò.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.162
Sorry you had to wait,
but you're a little early.

24:06.999 --> 24:08.801
No problem.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.470
Silence, please!

24:46.537 --> 24:48.206
Forgive me,

24:48.406 --> 24:50.408
but I want to make a toast.

24:53.444 --> 24:55.246
All the best, Don Salvatore.

24:55.446 --> 24:56.447
All the best!

24:56.647 --> 24:59.250
- All the best, for a hundred years!
- Thank you.

24:59.483 --> 25:01.819
- All the best, Salvatore.
- All the best, Salvatore.

25:02.319 --> 25:03.320
Cheers.

25:08.458 --> 25:11.261
This is just a little something
from me and Prince.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.063
You shouldn't have!

25:16.099 --> 25:18.401
- You can do it!
- C'mon!

25:18.602 --> 25:20.003
Okay...

25:20.203 --> 25:22.672
This is for the pleasure
of meeting you.

25:22.872 --> 25:24.474
Thank you very much.

25:29.078 --> 25:30.480
Nice.

25:30.713 --> 25:32.782
Thank you, Prince.
Thank you, Mulatto.

25:32.982 --> 25:34.584
It's beautiful, thank you so much.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.185
Like it?

25:37.687 --> 25:39.488
I'm glad.

25:55.070 --> 25:58.073
<i>In tears I left so blue</i>

26:00.275 --> 26:03.478
<i>It was a crazy thing to do</i>

26:06.314 --> 26:08.917
<i>Staying far from you</i>

26:11.286 --> 26:13.855
<i>You're my whole life...</i>

26:14.055 --> 26:17.659
Where'd this guy come from?
This is nuts!

26:18.660 --> 26:22.063
<i>Gazing sight to sight</i>

26:24.065 --> 26:26.934
<i>My heart squeezed tight</i>

26:28.135 --> 26:29.770
Where'd this guy come from?

26:29.937 --> 26:31.839
<i>A voice crying out</i>

26:32.073 --> 26:34.875
<i>A voice that can't be heard</i>

26:35.076 --> 26:39.480
<i>To then burst with all my pain</i>

26:39.713 --> 26:43.384
Pain? The pain when you
take it in the ass, faggot?

26:46.086 --> 26:48.655
- What's he saying?
- The pain bursts!

26:48.856 --> 26:53.060
<i>The sky is dark
but sunlight makes the sea blue</i>

26:53.460 --> 26:56.062
<i>I want no one but you, just you</i>

26:56.296 --> 26:58.498
<i>If I'm no longer
the queen of this king...</i>

26:58.698 --> 27:02.869
You're the queen,
the queen of this dick!

27:03.069 --> 27:04.738
The queen of boners!

27:17.416 --> 27:19.819
How about boner to boner,
right here!

27:20.052 --> 27:22.621
- Too small?
- Knock it off, Totò.

27:22.822 --> 27:25.024
C'mon, we're having fun.

27:25.458 --> 27:29.061
Here, faggot!
This is big, like it?

27:29.261 --> 27:30.863
Boner to boner...

27:42.441 --> 27:44.042
Just look at that...

27:50.048 --> 27:52.317
Where are you going? He's offended!

28:21.145 --> 28:22.746
Stop, stop!

28:23.680 --> 28:25.282
Don Salvatore...

28:28.719 --> 28:30.587
The honor's yours.

29:13.862 --> 29:15.697
Nothing's happened.

29:17.699 --> 29:19.501
The party continues.

29:22.504 --> 29:24.506
Bring another knife.

29:24.906 --> 29:27.309
Guys, it's all okay.

29:28.910 --> 29:31.513
Don Salvatore, I apologize,

29:31.746 --> 29:35.417
I didn't know the singer
was your girlfriend's sister.

29:37.152 --> 29:40.221
I'm sorry...
What should I do, get on my knees?

29:42.890 --> 29:45.093
As of tomorrow,
your dealing spot goes to Prince.

29:45.293 --> 29:48.095
- But why, Don Salvatore?
- That's it.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.033
Now get out, I'm busy.

30:12.891 --> 30:14.692
He put a hole in his hand!

30:15.360 --> 30:17.328
He says he hit a nerve.

30:17.562 --> 30:19.597
He might not get his hand back!

30:20.264 --> 30:22.533
That piece of shit Mulatto...

30:22.733 --> 30:24.135
that'll teach him!

30:24.335 --> 30:27.738
Him and that jerk friend of his...
showing off!

30:27.938 --> 30:29.807
Instead they don't count a fuck.

30:31.709 --> 30:33.711
But this is the time.

30:35.446 --> 30:38.048
Because if Conte
pisses us off, it's one thing,

30:38.916 --> 30:41.084
but pissing off his own men
is something else.

30:41.285 --> 30:43.086
You know, Ciro,

30:43.320 --> 30:46.590
we talked to Conte, he won't listen.

30:47.758 --> 30:49.126
Yeah.

30:50.894 --> 30:52.596
We don't have to talk to him.

31:05.174 --> 31:07.176
So, what is it, Ciro?

31:07.410 --> 31:08.811
There's a problem.

31:09.545 --> 31:11.747
If you knew all of mine!

31:13.149 --> 31:15.151
They're all pissed off.

31:16.318 --> 31:18.587
They want the stuff at Conte's price.

31:18.788 --> 31:21.857
So, why talk to us? Go see him!

31:22.057 --> 31:24.360
I already have

31:24.526 --> 31:26.161
and you know that.

31:27.730 --> 31:29.832
There was no way.

31:30.833 --> 31:34.703
If Conte wouldn't listen,
why should we?

31:36.738 --> 31:39.741
Because the guy on top
must never forget:

31:41.610 --> 31:43.011
his power

31:44.145 --> 31:46.748
is in the hands of those under him.

31:47.348 --> 31:49.818
So, Conte's not okay with you?

31:52.554 --> 31:54.756
Because he's okay with you?

31:59.327 --> 32:01.329
Ciro, will you knock it off?

32:02.730 --> 32:04.332
What do you want from us?

32:05.032 --> 32:07.601
I went nuts to make this alliance,

32:08.936 --> 32:10.337
nuts.

32:11.939 --> 32:14.942
But it shouldn't be this way,
it should be different.

32:16.410 --> 32:18.412
This is no democracy.

32:19.346 --> 32:22.950
The guy on the top gets rich,
the others starve and keep quiet.

32:24.351 --> 32:25.719
Mulatto...

32:27.721 --> 32:30.724
how long before
he'll let you see a cent?

32:32.525 --> 32:33.927
And why?

32:35.128 --> 32:36.930
What did you do wrong?

32:38.731 --> 32:41.334
You made fun of a fucking faggot.

32:44.937 --> 32:46.939
You, Gabriele?

32:47.607 --> 32:50.610
No one can
cut cocaine better than you.

32:53.279 --> 32:56.682
But we work and he makes the money.

33:02.688 --> 33:04.490
And he says we're free.

33:06.358 --> 33:07.359
It's not true.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.763
I bought my freedom

33:11.964 --> 33:13.966
with blood.

33:15.233 --> 33:17.035
What do you want to do?

33:17.235 --> 33:19.771
Be slaves all your life?

33:20.005 --> 33:22.007
Or freemen...

33:24.409 --> 33:26.378
really free?

33:32.217 --> 33:33.585
Think about it.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.001
Hello?

36:09.202 --> 36:11.003
Ciro, I've thought about it.

36:12.405 --> 36:15.408
There's a procession tonight
in his mom's town.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.810
He always goes,
it's important to him.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.246
That's the right time.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.615
The right time?

36:22.781 --> 36:24.583
You know for what.

36:25.184 --> 36:28.987
He wants you there to tell you
he accepts your conditions,

36:30.522 --> 36:33.325
but he really wants
to take you out...

36:33.992 --> 36:36.595
So, we have to take him out first.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.398
- And Prince?
- He's here and thinks like me.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.573
Why should I trust you?

36:48.807 --> 36:51.609
Because we've decided
to be freemen.

36:55.813 --> 36:59.417
I'll come for you,
and explain it over coffee.

37:27.911 --> 37:30.147
You can have your dealing spot back.

38:08.417 --> 38:10.018
What are you doing here?

38:11.653 --> 38:13.255
Let me come up.

38:14.289 --> 38:15.924
Why?

38:16.858 --> 38:18.360
I have to talk to you.

38:24.099 --> 38:26.501
Not for now, Don Salvatore.

38:28.837 --> 38:30.605
My head's on fire.

38:34.409 --> 38:36.811
But after what happened
the other night,

38:37.412 --> 38:40.214
I haven't eaten for two days
and can't get out of bed.

38:42.717 --> 38:44.285
That's why...

38:44.518 --> 38:46.187
I have to apologize.

38:46.387 --> 38:48.189
Let me come up.

38:51.692 --> 38:53.193
And then what?

38:54.094 --> 38:55.896
We go on like this?

38:58.265 --> 38:59.666
Or will things change?

39:06.006 --> 39:08.608
We can't for now,
you have to understand.

39:19.586 --> 39:22.055
Then go your way
and never be seen again.

41:35.955 --> 41:37.356
Go along.

42:23.734 --> 42:25.936
<i>I hear</i>

42:26.937 --> 42:30.541
<i>The bitter wailing</i>

42:33.677 --> 42:39.082
<i>Of the sorrowful mother</i>

42:43.353 --> 42:47.958
<i>She wanders among the squads</i>

42:50.961 --> 42:55.932
<i>Looking for her beloved...</i>

45:46.764 --> 45:48.866
Did you ever think, Ciro...

45:50.901 --> 45:52.503
The snake

45:55.406 --> 45:57.408
is always with the Holy Virgin

46:05.415 --> 46:07.217
and never with Jesus.

46:10.220 --> 46:12.622
She's the only one
who knows what to do.

46:14.224 --> 46:15.992
With one foot,

46:16.226 --> 46:18.628
she holds it firm to the ground,

46:18.795 --> 46:20.597
without needing to crush it.

46:22.398 --> 46:24.801
I wanted to do that with you.

46:26.803 --> 46:29.205
But I'm not the Holy Virgin.

46:41.350 --> 46:43.352
But with snakes like you

46:43.585 --> 46:45.854
I gotta cut their heads off.

46:47.823 --> 46:50.425
There's a procession tonight
in his mom's town,

46:50.592 --> 46:51.693
that's the right time.

46:51.894 --> 46:53.962
- The right time?
- You know for what.

46:54.162 --> 46:57.365
He wants you there to tell you
he accepts your conditions,

46:57.566 --> 47:00.435
but he really wants
to take you out...

47:00.635 --> 47:03.038
- And Prince?
- He's here and thinks like me.

47:03.238 --> 47:05.640
I'll take this
to the top of the alliance,

47:05.840 --> 47:07.642
together with your head.
