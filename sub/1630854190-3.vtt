Previously on
So Help Me Todd...I am a private detective.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.744
You were.I lost my job.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.181
Two years ago.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.225
My mother, Margaret Wright,
works here,

00:08.269 --> 00:09.748
and I work for her.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.141
Yep, it's true.
I work for my mother.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.535
Susan.I haven't seen you since we...

00:13.578 --> 00:15.058
We? Since you...Well, it ended.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.234
I think Harry
has left me.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.019
How are you doing
with everything?

00:19.062 --> 00:22.935
I just want to move past it.

00:23.849 --> 00:26.504

00:26.548 --> 00:28.637

what's in your mind... ♪

00:31.901 --> 00:34.947
[doorbell rings]Oh, hey, look who's here.

00:34.991 --> 00:37.907
Oh. Hey.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.169
Feels like old times, huh?

00:39.213 --> 00:40.779
Elliot drops off the map
for a few years,

00:40.823 --> 00:43.086
and then boom,
Saturday party.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.958
It's like being back
in college again, right?

00:46.002 --> 00:48.135
Did you read the Evite?

00:48.178 --> 00:49.832
Wait, is this a birthday party?

00:49.875 --> 00:51.616
Why do you have a gift?
DidI read the Evite?

00:51.660 --> 00:53.270
What is that?A bottle warmer.

00:53.314 --> 00:56.273
A bottle warmer?
To warm what?

00:56.317 --> 00:57.970
Milk.[door opens]

00:58.014 --> 00:59.102
Hi!

00:59.146 --> 01:00.625
Oh, my God,

01:00.669 --> 01:02.758
you are so pregnant.What?!

01:02.801 --> 01:04.890
What the hell? Hi.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.544
Hey, man.Hey.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.285
KATE: Thank you so much
for coming. Please come in.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.113
SUSAN: I can't wait.I have so much to tell you.

01:10.157 --> 01:14.117
Bro, you guys back together,
you and Suze?

01:14.161 --> 01:16.598
No.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.211
Peter's so sorry
he couldn't make it.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.647
He had to work this weekend.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.868
Yeah. So he can
pay off this rock.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.044
Look at it.
It's gorgeous.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.828
I hope you insured it.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.265
Our policy guy is great
if you need one.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.875
Recommended by our home lender.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.137
Did you two refinance

01:34.181 --> 01:35.965
that renovation
of your bonus room

01:36.008 --> 01:37.662
after you waterproofed
the basement?

01:37.706 --> 01:39.838
No, we decided to just
expand the mudroom.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.927
Todd?Hmm?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.103
What have you been up to?

01:43.146 --> 01:46.758
Well, uh, let's see.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.325
Don't have a mudroom,
don't have a basement,

01:48.369 --> 01:50.022
not engaged, not expecting.

01:50.066 --> 01:54.679
But I am working as a private
investigator... again.

01:54.723 --> 01:57.160
We're both working
with Todd's mom.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.901
OTHERS:
Oh...

01:58.944 --> 02:01.251
Well, it's much cooler
than it sounds.

02:01.295 --> 02:02.948
She's a lawyer.
A lot of murder.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.907
You know, knives.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.912
Well, I think that's great.
You know,

02:09.955 --> 02:12.219
pulling yourself up
by your mom's boot straps

02:12.262 --> 02:15.178
and, you know, finally
digging into adulthood.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.266
Speaking of which,
how's everyone's

02:16.310 --> 02:18.181
stock portfolios doing?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.878
Oh, it's a nightmare.Oh, my God...

02:19.922 --> 02:22.620
[all talking at once]

02:25.362 --> 02:27.016
The place is looking great, Mom.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.887
Oh, well, the paint needs
some touch-ups,

02:28.931 --> 02:32.369
and not all of my art works,
but it's coming along.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.851
Thank you so much for
these beautiful flowers.

02:35.894 --> 02:36.765
Of course.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.158
I'm so glad you stopped using

02:38.201 --> 02:39.637
that florist in Northwest.

02:39.681 --> 02:43.380
Oh, I found something
for you before I forget.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.252
I found it in one
of the boxes.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.647
Are you going to this benefit?

02:49.691 --> 02:51.780
MARGARET:
No, I completely forgot.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.912
We bought those tickets
ages ago.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.872
Didn't you and Harry used to
go to this thing every year?

02:56.915 --> 02:58.395
We did.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.658
But now I'm not.

03:00.702 --> 03:03.226
You haven't told anybody
yet, about Harry.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.314
What would I tell them?

03:04.358 --> 03:05.924
That he's in Iceland,

03:05.968 --> 03:09.319
naked and fishing
under the stars...

03:09.363 --> 03:11.713
No. I don't want to
deal with that. Not yet.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.454
No one needs to know.But eventually

03:13.497 --> 03:15.369
you're gonna have
to tell people.Why don't you come with me?

03:15.412 --> 03:16.805
As a buffer,
so no one asks questions.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.242
No, Chuck and I have
a wedding to go to.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.418
I'm sure Lawrence is busy, but
you could probably take Todd.

03:21.462 --> 03:24.334
To the Symphony Benefit Gala?

03:24.378 --> 03:25.944
He doesn't even own a tux.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.381
Okay. Or you could
go by yourself.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.860
But you love this event.
You can't not go.

03:28.904 --> 03:32.255
I am not showing up
anywhere alone.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.735
Okay.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.954
[indistinct chatter]

03:39.001 --> 03:40.829
Brian?

03:40.872 --> 03:42.265
Dude.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.962
Oh, wow.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.137
Todd frickin' Wright.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.530
Good to see you, man.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.402
What is this, the grade
school section of the party?

03:48.445 --> 03:50.969
The way, way, way back area?

03:51.013 --> 03:52.797
Yeah, is everyone aware
that you lost

03:52.841 --> 03:54.451
fourth grade class president
to, uh, me?

03:54.495 --> 03:56.888
Oh, I believe you stepped down
as president

03:56.932 --> 03:58.716
'cause you couldn't stop
throwing up.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.979
Ah, the pressure, man,
the pressure.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.286
How you doing?I'm good, I'm good.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.288
Just looking for where all
the unmarried losers

04:05.332 --> 04:06.463
are supposed to hang here.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.030
Yeah, what is up
with this party?

04:08.073 --> 04:11.076
Everyone's pants are
so, uh, pressed.
Yeah.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.427
All people want to talk about
is their mortgages and kids.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.994
I'm like, um, "I live
with my uncle."

04:16.038 --> 04:18.475
Oh, I live in
my sister's garage.Oh, dude, don't even.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.957
I'm still driving that busted
2002 Ford Focus.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.265
I was driving my mom's
2001 Acura

04:25.308 --> 04:26.396
till it broke down.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.311
Okay, wow, yeah.
So you win.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.095
Or lose. Loser.Yeah. Mm-hmm.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.749
[both laugh]

04:31.793 --> 04:34.839
So, uh, how have you been?

04:34.883 --> 04:38.887
Uh, you know, the past
few years have been kinda rough.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.192
You and me both.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.933
I was just starting to
turn stuff around and,

04:41.977 --> 04:44.501
it's so stupid, I totally
screwed it all up.

04:44.545 --> 04:47.330
I-I went out for drinks
on my birthday...

04:47.374 --> 04:48.331
Oh, thanks for inviting me.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.506
You are so welcome.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.203
And, uh, I was pretty lit,

04:51.247 --> 04:53.423
so I was walking home
instead of driving,

04:53.467 --> 04:56.339
and I took a break
and passed out on a bench

04:56.383 --> 04:58.341
and got arrested
for trespassing.

04:58.385 --> 04:59.864
Yup.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.823
And now I may be
going to prison, so...

05:01.866 --> 05:03.520
What?!Yeah.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.217
For sleeping on a bench?Yeah.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.524
I was on the grounds of some
fancy private school,

05:07.568 --> 05:10.266
and I already got a few
dumb arrests, so...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.050
Whatever, you know.
It's okay.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.444
And my public defender,
who is, uh...

05:14.488 --> 05:16.011
Her name is "Misty."

05:16.054 --> 05:17.795
Uh-huh.She said, "Oh, you could do

05:17.839 --> 05:19.536
a year on the inside.
You'll be out in nine months."

05:19.580 --> 05:20.929
So, yeah, thanks. Cheers.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.845
Brian, you gotta fight this.

05:23.888 --> 05:27.022
You can't just give up.
You need a-a new plan.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.894
A second chance.
Look, I was just...

05:29.938 --> 05:32.941
Eh, I think I'm all out
of second chances, man.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.465
No. No.

05:35.509 --> 05:40.862
What you need is
a really good lawyer.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.561
These budget items came
to my attention

05:44.605 --> 05:48.304
through accounting...Mom? Mom? Hey.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.305
Mom? Oh.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.133
Hello.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.395
Would you like me to stop?

05:52.439 --> 05:55.050
No. Continue.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.835
"Line items expensed to

That's enough.

All of that stuff is
work-related,

Thank you very much, Lyle.
Good job.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.428
Thank you very much,
Mr. Mall Cop.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.604
Really appreciate
everything you're doing.

06:27.648 --> 06:28.605
[scoffs]
Okay, fine.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.998
Whatever. Mom, listen.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.001
Do you remember
Brian McAtee?

06:33.044 --> 06:34.524
Your friend from
grade school?Uh-huh.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.961
Of course I remember him.
He was a little hoodlum.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.963
No, he wasn't. And no one
says "hoodlum" anymore.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.138
People still say it.
I just said it.

06:40.182 --> 06:41.444
Okay, well,
that doesn't count.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.141
Okay, he was a juvenile
delinquent.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.143
He spent time in
juvenile detention.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.188
He was a juvenile...

06:46.231 --> 06:47.537
Look, that's all a thing
of the past.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.191
What he really needs
right now

06:49.234 --> 06:50.975
is an incredible lawyer
to get him out of

06:51.019 --> 06:52.150
some dumb trespassing charge.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.979
Absolutely not.Okay, you're open to it.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.894
I like that.
I mean, yes,

06:56.938 --> 06:58.330
Brian has made some mistakes,

06:58.374 --> 07:00.332
and he might have
a little bit of a rap sheet...

07:00.376 --> 07:01.551
A little bit
of a rap sheet?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.466
But all harmless misdemeanors.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.555
Public urination, jaywalking,

07:05.599 --> 07:07.339
cashing a few bad checks,
whatever.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.472
But he's finally getting
his life back on track.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.083
He's trying so hard, Mom.

07:12.127 --> 07:16.305
Todd, he stole $30
from my purse when he was ten.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.480
Oh, come on, we all stole $30

07:17.524 --> 07:19.613
from your purse
when we were ten.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.919
Look, Brian never knew
his mom,

07:21.963 --> 07:24.487
his dad was never around.Because he was in prison.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.054
And he was raised
by his uncle.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.665
Can't you just have a he...Todd! I am very busy,

07:28.709 --> 07:31.015
and I am not going to waste
my valuable time

07:31.059 --> 07:33.278
on a certified lifelong criminal
who's only going to end up

07:33.322 --> 07:35.933
right back in trouble
the minute I clear his name.

07:37.065 --> 07:40.198
Do you know what
recidivism is?

07:40.242 --> 07:42.462
No, I don't know what
recidivism is.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.028
God, you're so judgmental.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.508
I'm not judgmental,
I'm a realist.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.684
I tiger can't change
its stripes.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.512
I hate zoo metaphors.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.514
People don't change.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.516
Isn't one of the law
commandments

07:53.560 --> 07:55.039
to have an open mind,

07:55.083 --> 07:56.606
or give people
the benefit of the doubt,

07:56.650 --> 07:58.216
or not harm a human being?

07:58.260 --> 07:59.696
That is a law for robots.

07:59.740 --> 08:01.698
Well, it must be nice
to be perfect.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.221
To have no flaws.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.136
Oh, it's exhausting.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.358
You're very judgmental.

08:09.401 --> 08:12.143
Goodbye. Go away.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.107
[car lock chirps]

08:19.716 --> 08:21.152
[both gasp]

08:21.196 --> 08:24.155
Margaret!
It is so good to see you.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.506
Erica, Desiree.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.725
What a wonderful surprise.

08:28.769 --> 08:30.161
Where have you been?

08:30.205 --> 08:33.382
Oh, we haven't seen you
or Harry in so long.

08:33.425 --> 08:35.645
And you missed Eve Miller's
birthday brunch.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.256
Well, we've been so busy.

08:38.300 --> 08:41.738
We moved,
and it just feels like

08:41.782 --> 08:43.479
I haven't been able to see
anybody these days.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.656
Tom said Harry hasn't returned
any of his calls or emails.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.311
And Drake says he's missed
two golf games.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.574
Is everything all right?

08:51.618 --> 08:55.099
Oh, yes, it's fine.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.580
I can't imagine why he would
have been so inconsiderate.

08:57.624 --> 09:01.628
So you two will be at the
Symphony Benefit on Saturday?Of course.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.455
Do you know who else
will be there?

09:03.499 --> 09:04.674
Sondra Brayton.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.676
She just got out
of rehab, again.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.156
That poor woman,

09:08.199 --> 09:09.331
she just cannot
pull herself together.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.725
Oh, they always backslide.

09:11.768 --> 09:14.075
Shopaholics,
alcoholics, hoarders.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.468
Even divorced people.
They get divorced again.

09:16.512 --> 09:20.472
Well, Erica, that's...

09:20.516 --> 09:22.518
very judgmental.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.477
Once a mess,
always a mess.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.132
Oh, well, I have got to go.

09:28.176 --> 09:31.222
We will see you
Saturday night, right?

09:31.266 --> 09:33.137
Of course.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.315
TODD:
This is so amazing

09:37.359 --> 09:39.317
that you're doing this.
Thank you so much.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.492
What changed your mind?

09:40.536 --> 09:43.321
Oh, well, maybe I was
a little judgmental

09:43.365 --> 09:45.628
about Brian.

09:46.542 --> 09:50.111
Thank you so much for
helping me out, Mrs. Wright.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.634
I always thought
you were awesome.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.811
Oh, well, thank you.

09:54.855 --> 09:57.379
Uh, uh, Todd,
give me your tie.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.815
Yeah. Gladly. Sure.

09:58.859 --> 09:59.816
Okay, here, let me...I got it. It's fine.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.731
Ow. Don't touch me.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.254
I used to change
your diapers.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.342
Yeah. Not in public.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.738
Okay, there you go.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.306
Wow, that tie's
perfect for you.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.743
You know, she got it
at Berg-Dork Goodman.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.310
[video game blips]Here, you do it.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.790
Excuse me, sir,
is that your son?Yes.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.574
Well, he needs to
turn that off in here.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.793
He will. Sorry. Single dad.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.098
Way too much screen time.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.752
Danny, that's enough.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.536
You know how it is.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.539
You're Todd's mom.
I'm Brian's uncle, Johnny.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.845
And this is my son Danny.

10:29.759 --> 10:33.110
You have no idea how much we all
appreciate you doing this.

10:33.154 --> 10:34.372
It's my pleasure.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.157
I've been raising Brian
since he was 12.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.725
Took him in when I was
barely an adult myself.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.204
Seeing him here in court,

10:40.248 --> 10:43.381
your kid in trouble
with the law, it's rough.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.427
We'll get through it,
he'll be okay.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.124
You'll be okay, too.

10:47.168 --> 10:50.388
It's a constant struggle keeping
'em on the right path, isn't it?

10:50.432 --> 10:52.173
This is good.Yeah, feels good.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.218
Ah, Trevor.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.437
Margaret.
Afternoon.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.352
Looks like a busy day for you.Yeah.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.441
Trevor, we both know
you have bigger fish to fry,

10:59.484 --> 11:01.530
so let's not make a meal
out of my client's

11:01.573 --> 11:03.401
ridiculous misdemeanor charge.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.361
Aren't you and Amelia going
to Hawaii next week?

11:06.404 --> 11:07.710
So let's cut to the chase
so we don't

11:07.754 --> 11:09.190
interrupt that vacation.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.235
Brian McAtee will pay the fine

11:11.279 --> 11:13.890
and 500 hours
of community service,

11:13.934 --> 11:15.413
and I guarantee you,

11:15.457 --> 11:17.764
you will never
see his face in here again.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.246
Great. Thank you.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.814
Honestly,
it's a trespassing charge.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.816
It's not like he's gonna
run out and rob a bank.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.296
Ah.
[chuckles]

11:29.950 --> 11:31.429
It's done.We're done? Yes!

11:31.473 --> 11:32.604
Yes!

11:32.648 --> 11:34.737
Amazing.
Thank you.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
Oh, my gosh.

11:36.783 --> 11:40.438
See? Told you
she could fix this.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.486
REPORTER:
In breaking news tonight,
earlier this evening,

11:44.529 --> 11:47.315
a burglary at
Triple A Pawnbrokers,

11:47.358 --> 11:51.536
interrupting a 104-day
crime-free streak

11:51.580 --> 11:53.364
in North Portland.

11:53.408 --> 11:57.325
Local man Brian McAtee
has been identified

11:57.368 --> 11:59.762
as the suspect,
and is being arrested

11:59.806 --> 12:01.372
here at his uncle's home.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.331
I-I didn't do it!

12:03.374 --> 12:06.508
And my lawyer Margaret Wright
will prove my innocence.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.944
I didn't do it!

12:09.816 --> 12:12.209
♪

12:16.605 --> 12:18.259
MARGARET: All right,
Brian, tell me what happened.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.782
BRIAN: I was asleep,
and the cops busted in

12:19.826 --> 12:20.870
and arrested me.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.524
Uh-huh.It's insane.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.873
I didn't even know why
they were arresting me.

12:23.917 --> 12:27.442
I-I didn't rob anybody.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.662
Well, it says here that
$5,000 in cash,

12:30.706 --> 12:33.753
some jewelry and various
other items were stolen.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.756
Where were you last night?

12:36.799 --> 12:39.889
I was at home babysitting
my cousin Danny.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.849
All night.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.504
Three different security cameras
captured your car

12:46.548 --> 12:49.594
within blocks of Triple A
Pawnbrokers at around 11:00 p.m.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.771
No, that's impossible.
I never even left the house.

12:51.814 --> 12:55.296
I... [scoffs]
I drank a few beers

12:55.339 --> 12:57.515
while watching the Trailblazers
game, and then

12:57.559 --> 12:59.953
passed out on the couch
after the third quarter.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.955
Well, that is the same excuse
that you used

13:01.998 --> 13:03.260
for your trespassing charges.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.349
You got drunk and passed out.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.351
And you were supposed to be
babysitting at the time?

13:07.395 --> 13:09.745
Okay, so I got a few things
I gotta work on.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.227
You're lucky your uncle
posted bail.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.839
I hope you appreciate
all he's done for you.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.450
I know. I know.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.539
I have to prepare
for your arraignment.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.412
I will see you at the courthouse
later today.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.023
Be on time.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.596
I'm screwed.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.381
Stupid idiot.[sighs]

13:43.605 --> 13:46.651
He robbed a pawn shop, Todd.
A pawn shop.

13:46.695 --> 13:47.870
And he announced
to all of Portland

13:47.914 --> 13:48.915
that I am his lawyer.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.046
But you are his lawyer,

13:50.090 --> 13:51.569
and you can clear
his name, right?

13:51.613 --> 13:53.789
He's guilty. And I don't
have time for this case.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.617
No, he's innocent.
And this is important.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.315
He's a criminal, his car was
there, he has a record.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.404
He did it.No. It looks bad, I know.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.493
But in my gut I know
he didn't do it.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.147
I believe in him.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.409
He's right in the middle of
trying to turn his life around.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.846
Why would he screw
everything up

14:06.889 --> 14:07.934
by robbing some
stupid pawn shop?

14:07.977 --> 14:09.761
Gee, you tell me, Todd.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.807
Why would someone screw up
their entire life

14:11.851 --> 14:14.418
by doing something illegal?

14:14.462 --> 14:15.724
But I bounced back.

14:15.767 --> 14:16.899
Mm.With your help.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.509
Right? And look at me now,

14:18.553 --> 14:19.946
a productive member
of society putting on my pants

14:19.989 --> 14:21.599
and going to work every day.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.774
If putting on your pants
is the bar,

14:22.818 --> 14:23.906
then I have failed
as a mother.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.603
No, do not come in here!

14:25.647 --> 14:27.518
This door is closed to you.

14:27.562 --> 14:31.740
I need to go waste some more
of my billable hours

14:31.783 --> 14:33.437
doing the job of
a public defender.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.048
Well, thank you,
greedy lady lawyer,

14:35.091 --> 14:36.701
for deigning to help
my peasant friend

14:36.745 --> 14:38.660
with his expensive legal woes.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.618
I don't want to hear it.You know what,
I'm gonna go over

14:40.662 --> 14:42.098
to that pawn shop and
figure out who really did this.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.448
You are pouring your time
and mine down the toilet.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.407
Maybe Brian has a lookalike
or a car-a-like.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.931
Or maybe the pawn shop owner
robbed himself.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.454
Oh, my God, you're right.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.630
Maybe he did.
It could be insurance fraud.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.937
I know fraud.Yes, you do.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.505
That pawn shop is a crime scene
for the next 48 hours,

14:57.548 --> 15:00.595
and no one is going to
speak to you or let you in.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.860
Oh, won't they?
[chuckles]

15:06.514 --> 15:09.386
TODD:
Pawnbrokers. Here we go.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.779
Wait, I'm not--

15:10.822 --> 15:11.998
Are you sure your mom
okayed this? I'm not sure I...

15:12.041 --> 15:13.913
It's fine.
Just do what we said.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.479
Here, hold my arm.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.093
No, no, no.
Sorry, we're closed.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.572
We got robbed, and, uh,

15:21.616 --> 15:23.139
the police are still
doing their thing,

15:23.183 --> 15:24.967
and on top of everything,
my heat isn't working.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.056
It's freezing in here.My God, that's awful.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.666
But we really need to
get a price

15:28.710 --> 15:29.929
on this ring right away.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.889
We just got married...
in Venice.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.674
Venice, city of water
and love. How wonderful.

15:36.718 --> 15:40.548
But now we need the money...

15:40.591 --> 15:44.682
for the lifesaving surgery...

15:44.726 --> 15:46.423
on his brain.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.644
Oh, you poor, beautiful,
sweet kids.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.167
Mm-hmm.

15:51.211 --> 15:54.692
All right, all right.
Give me a second.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.913
Give me a second.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.611
So robbed, huh? Robbed.

16:00.655 --> 16:03.701
Did they break a window
to get in here or...

16:03.745 --> 16:06.008
Nah, no sign of forced entry.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.444
But the front door was
wide open,

16:07.488 --> 16:08.706
so they must
have picked the lock.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.317
Uh-huh.And they somehow

16:10.360 --> 16:12.928
turned the power off, which
knocks out the security cameras.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.669
That was money well spent.

16:14.712 --> 16:15.844
You don't have a generator?

16:15.887 --> 16:17.541
It's busted.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.935
Just like
my last marriage.[all chuckle]

16:19.979 --> 16:23.504
But you two give me hope.
Okay, let's see.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.030
Oh, hey, lovely cut.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.076
Clarity, color...

16:30.119 --> 16:31.555
But at least you didn't
get wiped out.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.209
I mean, your insurance
should pay for

16:33.253 --> 16:35.516
all the stolen property, right?What insurance?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.822
I got rid of it
when I got the cameras.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.042
Then they go out, can't win.

16:40.086 --> 16:44.873
I can offer you maybe $6,500
for the ring.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.744
Oh, wow. Okay. Not bad.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.225
How much money did we spend
again for the ring, sweetheart?

16:49.269 --> 16:51.097
$117,000.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.750
What?!Didn't you buy this?

16:52.794 --> 16:56.058
No. Oh, yes. No.
Family heirloom.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.147
My grandmother was a surgeon.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.932
She found it inside
somebody dead.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.586
Wait, I have to ask.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.936
Your only security was
the cameras?

17:04.980 --> 17:07.243
Does that seem prudent?
What with all of your inventory

17:07.287 --> 17:10.681
displayed like this in easily
accessible glass cases?

17:10.725 --> 17:12.901
I don't know prudent.
We had a security guard, too,

17:12.944 --> 17:14.076
but he was useless.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.643
I let him go a few
months ago.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.036
And has someone
followed up with him

17:17.079 --> 17:18.689
as a potential suspect?Yes.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.126
I gave them his name.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.215
As a matter of fact,
I thought that disgruntled jerk

17:22.258 --> 17:23.912
might have been
behind all of this

17:23.955 --> 17:25.957
until the police, you know,
nabbed the real guy.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.047
Uh-huh.
Wait, the security guard.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.178
I think I know him.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.093
Uh, Kinky Beaderman?Kinky what?

17:31.137 --> 17:32.094
Kinky Beaderman.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.095
No.
No?

17:33.139 --> 17:34.227
Grady Tibbels.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.272
Grady Tibbels, of course.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.013
Anyway, good luck
on your surgery.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.884
You two make
a beautiful couple.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.931
You're gonna be fine, huh?

17:42.974 --> 17:44.541
He understands me, right?

17:46.021 --> 17:49.111
Oh, uh, wait.
Um, so, the ring.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.635
What are we doing?
Do you want the money, or...

17:51.679 --> 17:53.637
Oh, thank you so much
for the estimate,

17:53.681 --> 17:56.118
but I think we're gonna
hold out for a better offer.Mm-hmm.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.294
Let's go.Okay.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.166
Your mom did not
approve of this.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.081
Yeah, but I approved of it,
and she can deal with it.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.299
And "Kinky Beaderman"?

18:03.343 --> 18:04.561
That'sthe name
you came up with?

18:04.605 --> 18:06.563
That name alwaysworks.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
Not guilty.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.263
Your Honor, given the
defendant's criminal record,

18:10.306 --> 18:11.916
the state asks that
you revoke bail

18:11.960 --> 18:13.092
and place him back
into custody

18:13.135 --> 18:14.658
until his preliminary hearing.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.705
Your Honor, this charge
is not a violent felony.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.750
Might I remind you
that Mr. McAtee

18:19.794 --> 18:21.926
was just here being arraigned
on a different charge?

18:21.970 --> 18:24.233
That has nothing to do
with today's arraignment.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.583
Exactly.
Today'sarraignment.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.150
Yesterday was
a misdemeanor charge,

18:28.194 --> 18:29.717
today a felony.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.675
What new charge can we
look forward to tomorrow?

18:31.719 --> 18:35.288
JUDGE:
All right, Mr. McAtee will
wear an ankle monitor,

18:35.331 --> 18:36.854
and cannot travel
outside of the county.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.900
What? For real?JUDGE: The court will set a date

18:38.943 --> 18:40.771
for his preliminary hearing.

18:45.211 --> 18:48.301
"It's not like he's gonna
run out and rob a bank."

18:53.915 --> 18:56.047
Go ahead.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.223
What happens now?

18:57.266 --> 19:01.357
Uh, I suggest we consider
a plea deal.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.229
But he just pled not guilty.

19:03.272 --> 19:06.710
He's facing ten years
in prison, a $250,000 fine.

19:06.754 --> 19:10.149
He has no sound alibi,
he has an extensive rap sheet.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.063
Yeah, I feared
this day would come.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.761
His dad is a lowlife.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.197
I wasn't around enough.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.157
I was working too hard
trying to keep these kids alive.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.332
This is all my fault.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.377
I understand how you feel,

19:21.421 --> 19:25.120
but you can't blame yourself.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.774
Parenting is hard,
and if you're

19:26.817 --> 19:29.385
doing it alone, it's impossible.You think he did it.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.214
I don't know.[sighs]

19:32.258 --> 19:34.216
But with a plea deal,

19:34.260 --> 19:36.218
we might be able to get
a reduced sentence.

19:36.262 --> 19:39.395
It's all my fault, damn it.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.789
How long before this one's
behind bars?

19:45.271 --> 19:47.795
Danny, come on.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.233
Let's go.

19:56.804 --> 20:01.243
Brand-new 80-inch
4K TV, huh?

20:01.287 --> 20:05.291
Where'd we get the money
for that, Mr. Grady Tibbels?

20:05.334 --> 20:07.945
[camera shutter clicking]

20:07.989 --> 20:10.209
What the hell are you
doing here?

20:15.301 --> 20:16.693
Tell me why you're
creeping around my house

20:16.737 --> 20:18.129
or I'm gonna blow
your frickin' brains out!

20:18.173 --> 20:20.088
Hey, hey, hey. There's no
need to threaten the guy

20:20.131 --> 20:22.699
who's here to save you money on
your heating and cooling bills.

20:22.743 --> 20:23.700
You know, I noticed that
your windows are--

20:23.744 --> 20:24.701
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:24.745 --> 20:25.963
Your name is Grady Tibbels,

20:26.007 --> 20:27.226
and at least ten people
know I'm here.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.749
And scrubbing my brain matter

20:28.792 --> 20:29.967
off all this brick would be
extremely difficult.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.708
How do you know my name?

20:31.752 --> 20:33.971
I'm a private investigator.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.364
Wow, I haven't been able
to say that legitimately

20:35.408 --> 20:38.149
for a long time.
Please don't kill me.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.282
Is this about my ex-girlfriend?
The paternity test?

20:40.326 --> 20:42.719
Or my ex-wife?
Her paternity test?

20:42.763 --> 20:44.199
Is this about maybe
the money I borrowed

20:44.243 --> 20:45.983
from that loan shark,
or the boat that I stole?

20:46.027 --> 20:47.855
No, to all of that.

20:47.898 --> 20:48.899
Wait, you stole a boat?

20:48.943 --> 20:50.161
Then why are you here?!

20:50.205 --> 20:51.859
Triple A Pawnbrokers
was robbed last night,

20:51.902 --> 20:52.860
and I was wondering if you...

20:52.903 --> 20:55.079
[laughs]
That dump?

20:55.123 --> 20:57.299
Too bad. I was parked
at a poker table

20:57.343 --> 20:59.127
at Spirit Mountain Casino
the whole night.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.302
Cameras everywhere.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.738
[sighs sharply]

21:01.782 --> 21:03.305
Did you try the cameras
at the pawn shop?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.873
The thief turned off
the power and killed them.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.048
Not all of 'em.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.006
What does that mean?

21:09.050 --> 21:10.312
I'm not a snitch.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.358
Okay, but I am,

21:12.401 --> 21:14.229
and I have a few friends
who are process servers

21:14.273 --> 21:15.448
who would love to know
where to find you

21:15.491 --> 21:17.406
and this little boat you stole.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.625
[sighs]

21:18.668 --> 21:20.888
The owner of the place
next to the pawn shop,

21:20.931 --> 21:22.193
he's a real weirdo.

21:22.237 --> 21:25.066
He's into feet.
Like, human feet.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.502
Okay.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.504
So he rigged up this hidden
camera next to the sidewalk.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.027
It's battery operated.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.159
Uh-huh.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.248
Maybe it caught something.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.342
Were you able to get
anything out of that camera?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.518
Oh, you did it.
Oh, is this...

21:43.867 --> 21:46.435
Oh. Oh!

21:46.479 --> 21:48.045
What the hell
are you working on?

21:48.089 --> 21:50.439
It's, uh, the...

21:50.483 --> 21:53.877
Does she-- Does that person
know about the camera?

21:53.921 --> 21:57.533
Yes. They've been back and forth
in front of that place 20 times

21:57.577 --> 22:00.231
in 20 different pairs
of freak shoes.
Huh.

22:00.275 --> 22:01.798
I don't have time for this.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.800
I'm working on the Collins
murder/suicide trial.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.541
Oh, you're so lucky.

22:05.585 --> 22:09.284
LYLE:
Where in Sam Hill
did you find this?

22:11.242 --> 22:15.116
On the sidewalk
near the pawn shop.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.378
It's a long story.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.293
Can't we just fast-forward
to nighttime?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.555
Just zip ahead?

22:19.599 --> 22:21.818
Be my guest.

22:27.302 --> 22:28.999
Thanks a lot for turning
my expense report in

22:29.043 --> 22:30.087
to my mom, by the way.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.480
I can't believe you did that.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.265
I can't believe you spent $370

22:34.309 --> 22:37.138
on a porcelain figurine
of Harriet the Spy.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.574
It's the 60th anniversary!

22:38.618 --> 22:40.837
She's got her little
spy notebook, and...

22:40.881 --> 22:42.404
I mean, it's very cool.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.407
Very delicate and broke
way too easily, but very cool.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.540
Wait, wait. Okay.

22:47.583 --> 22:50.456
Here we go.

22:54.068 --> 22:57.419
No... way.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.290
TODD: So we need to
go up to the house

22:59.334 --> 23:01.118
and see if Johnny
or Brian are home.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.163
MARGARET:
And they were his feet?

23:02.206 --> 23:03.512
Mm-hmm.You're sure of it?

23:03.556 --> 23:05.601
Johnny's feet
in his boots?Yes. Yes. Yes.

23:05.645 --> 23:08.604
I saw Johnny wearing these
exact boots with the same orange

23:08.648 --> 23:12.129
sticker or price tag or whatever
in the courtroom. It was him.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.175
A sticker on a boot
is not enough evidence for me

23:14.218 --> 23:16.917
to go charging into someone's
home and accuse them of a crime.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.006
Okay. Well, Johnny has access
to Brian's car.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.617
And late that night,
his boots walked right up

23:21.661 --> 23:23.314
into the pawn shop
and straight in the front door.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.621
So he has a key?
He unlocked it?

23:25.665 --> 23:27.449
The owner said the lock
was picked, so either that,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.451
or he dropped down the chimney
like Santa Claus.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.453
But these are Johnny's boots,
he did it,

23:31.497 --> 23:34.325
and Brian is innocent.[siren chirps]

23:41.594 --> 23:44.161
Oh, wonderful.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.902
Now what?

23:45.946 --> 23:48.557
Come on.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.906
[Danny laughs]

23:49.950 --> 23:52.474
Officers, what...
what is going on here?

23:52.518 --> 23:54.084
I am the attorney
representing

23:54.128 --> 23:56.478
this child's cousin,
Brian McAtee.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.002
Your client cut off
his ankle bracelet and fled.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.917
No, no, no, no,
that can't be right.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.398
He fled? [scoffs]

24:03.442 --> 24:05.182
Are-are you sure?

24:05.226 --> 24:06.314
[clears throat]

24:06.357 --> 24:08.490
[exhales]

24:08.534 --> 24:11.362
DANNY:Gotcha!

24:11.406 --> 24:15.149
[grunts] Dude!
In your face! Kill shot!

24:15.192 --> 24:16.672
Who is he talking to?

24:16.716 --> 24:18.500
The person he's playing
the video game with.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.546
DANNY:Get him!Through the headset?

24:20.589 --> 24:22.199
He's playing someone
online, Mom.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.505
DANNY:
Yes! [laughs]Oh.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.508
Danny?

24:26.552 --> 24:29.250
Do you remember us
from the courthouse?

24:31.208 --> 24:33.515
Do you know where Brian is?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.387
Hello, I'm Alice Garrison.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.955
Johnny asked me
to watch Danny tonight.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.481
[quietly]:
He wasn't comfortable
leaving him alone with Brian

24:42.524 --> 24:44.308
after, you know,
everything that's happened.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.702
POLICEWOMAN:
We've got patrols
looking out for Brian.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.313
He won't get far.POLICEMAN:
And in my experience,

24:49.357 --> 24:52.273
when they run, they're guilty.

24:53.753 --> 24:57.539
POLICEWOMAN:
Ma'am, can we ask you
a few more questions?

25:02.022 --> 25:03.414
Danny?

25:03.458 --> 25:07.244
Do you have any idea
where your father is?

25:07.288 --> 25:08.376
Want some?

25:08.419 --> 25:10.987
Oh, uh, no, no. No, thank you.

25:11.031 --> 25:14.251
This suit is very clean,
and those are very

25:14.295 --> 25:16.558
unhealthy and bad for you.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.082
Are you sure you don't know
where your dad is?

25:19.126 --> 25:21.128
He's here.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.564
Huh.

25:24.479 --> 25:28.135
Todd, I need you
to call this numb...

25:28.178 --> 25:29.223
Todd?

25:29.266 --> 25:31.007
Todd?

25:31.051 --> 25:32.487
Where are you going?

25:32.531 --> 25:34.533
I need to find Brian to convince
him to turn himself in.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.491
Maybe he's at the bus station
or the airport,

25:36.535 --> 25:37.666
or-- I don't know--

25:37.710 --> 25:39.276
sleeping on a bench somewhere.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.148
The police will find him.No, no, no.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.150
I'm gonna find him first.
He's probably just drunk,

25:43.193 --> 25:45.108
and stupidly hiding out
in some bar somewhere.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.545
A tiger's spots don't change,
right?

25:46.588 --> 25:48.285
Or whatever that saying is.Todd,

25:48.329 --> 25:49.765
as much as we might want to,

25:49.809 --> 25:52.463
we can't always save
our clients from themselves.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.291
So, I should just
give up on him?

25:54.335 --> 25:56.598
A lawyer doesn't give up
on their clients.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.687
They build the best defense
they can,

25:58.731 --> 26:01.168
even when they disappoint us.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.778
Now come on.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.475
We need to go talk
to Johnny about his boots.

26:04.519 --> 26:07.304
I mean, whatever, the boots.
Brian took off.

26:07.348 --> 26:08.654
He cut his ankle monitor
and ran.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.569
Does that sound
like an innocent person to you?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.701
Todd, you asked me
to take this case, and I did.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.398
And I am going
to see it through.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.139
Johnny and Danny deserve that.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.359
But Brian doesn't?

26:20.666 --> 26:22.624
I'm gonna find him.

26:22.668 --> 26:27.107
Or at least... I'm gonna look.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.192
Not with two mouths to feed.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.456
And-and this was
your only option?

27:12.500 --> 27:15.459
Don't judge. It's legal,
and the good Lord blessed me

27:15.503 --> 27:17.853
with a little bit of rhythm
and a cute ass.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.333
Oh.I'll do whatever I need to

27:19.376 --> 27:21.291
to take care of my family.

27:21.335 --> 27:25.208
I understand completely,
and I'm not judging.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.863
I mean, maybe
if I'd had the... body,

27:27.907 --> 27:31.432
I would have done the same thing
when my first husband died.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.260
You're a widow.

27:33.303 --> 27:35.479
How long?

27:35.523 --> 27:40.746
I wasa widow
for, um, 15 years.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.705
Eight. It's weird, isn't it?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.272
Raising kids by yourself

27:45.315 --> 27:49.145
when you thought you'd be
doing it together... forever?

27:49.189 --> 27:51.365
Yes. I-I never imagined

27:51.408 --> 27:53.410
I'd be having
that conversation here,

27:53.454 --> 27:56.892
but, um, yes, it is weird.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.459
[laughs]

27:58.502 --> 28:00.896
Um, aren't you cold?

28:00.940 --> 28:02.855
Hell no! I'm burning up!

28:02.898 --> 28:04.813
Dancing's a great workout.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.902
And you were here
the night of the robbery

28:06.946 --> 28:08.730
with your boots?

28:08.774 --> 28:12.168
Yup. And a number of my regular
clients could confirm that.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.432
But Brian has those same boots.

28:15.476 --> 28:19.610
I bought two pairs.
Sale at Walmart.

28:19.654 --> 28:22.265
I don't know
how to tell you this,

28:22.309 --> 28:25.660
but we were over at your house
earlier-- Todd and I--

28:25.704 --> 28:27.618
and-and the cops were there,

28:27.662 --> 28:29.664
and they were
looking for Brian.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.754
He's cut off his ankle bracelet
and fled.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.364
What?! Cops?!Yes.

28:34.408 --> 28:35.888
Where's Danny?Well, he's...

28:35.931 --> 28:37.280
Well, he's fine. Please.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.412
[high-pitched]:
No! Sit...

28:38.455 --> 28:39.718
back down, please.

28:39.761 --> 28:43.417
Um, Mrs. Garrison
is still watching him.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.201
I can't believe Brian

28:45.245 --> 28:46.899
would do something so stupid!

28:46.942 --> 28:50.641
Damn it. I love him
as if he's my own son,

28:50.685 --> 28:52.556
but he just keeps
breaking my heart.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.297
He needs to turn himself in,

28:54.341 --> 28:56.517
or he's going to end up
in prison, just like his father.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.780
His father isn't in prison.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.434
Not anymore.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.479
Ray got out about a year ago.

29:02.523 --> 29:04.960
He did? Does Brian know that?

29:05.004 --> 29:06.962
I didn't tell him.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.399
His dad is bad news.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.488
What was his father
in prison for?

29:11.532 --> 29:14.796
Burglary. Like father,
like son, huh?

29:14.840 --> 29:18.278
Ray worked as a heat
and air conditioning repairman,

29:18.321 --> 29:20.280
and he robbed a bunch
of his clients.

29:20.323 --> 29:23.674
Ah. And he lives in Portland?

29:23.718 --> 29:27.243
Lives in Salem.
Fat Bass Trailer Park.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.724
Court notified me
when he got out.

29:30.812 --> 29:34.555
There may still be
hope for Brian.

29:36.383 --> 29:38.341
Thank you very much.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.343
[shrieks] Okay.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.738
I'm... I'm so sorry.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.522
[knocking]

29:46.872 --> 29:49.700
Well, hello there.

29:49.744 --> 29:54.314
Ray McAtee? I'm here
about your son, Brian.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.489
Do you have a moment?

29:55.532 --> 29:57.491
Sure. Sure, come on in.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.406
Get you a beer.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.848
Well, um, I'm sorry
to disturb you,

30:06.892 --> 30:10.025
but, uh, I'm-I'm a friend
of your son, Brian's, and

30:10.069 --> 30:13.507
I was just wondering
if-if you've spoken to him

30:13.550 --> 30:15.639
since you were released
from prison?

30:15.683 --> 30:17.685
I'm sorry to say I haven't.

30:17.728 --> 30:18.904
Ah.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.383
Why, thank you.

30:20.427 --> 30:23.386
No, not since, uh,
he was growing his first

30:23.430 --> 30:26.955
chest hair and my jerk brother,

30:26.999 --> 30:29.436
Johnny, stole him from me.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.046
And-and how did he do that?

30:31.090 --> 30:34.615
He called social services,
said I was an unfit parent.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.704
Unfit, my ass.

30:36.747 --> 30:39.533
Now that you are a free man,

30:39.576 --> 30:41.840
how is it
that you support yourself?

30:41.883 --> 30:44.755
I do what I can to scrape by.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.410
Once I get my HVAC business
going again,

30:47.454 --> 30:49.456
I'll be stacking the cash.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.066
You had your own business?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.895
Yeah, before I got locked up,
I used to fix HVAC systems.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.898
I was damn good at it, too.

31:01.468 --> 31:04.775
Look, I'm just saying,
people are gossiping about Mom.

31:04.819 --> 31:06.603
Oh, no! Gossip!Shut up.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.041
And Chuck's mom just heard
some crazy thing

31:09.084 --> 31:11.391
about Harry being in a cult.

31:11.434 --> 31:12.914
And it wouldn't kill you
to take Mom

31:12.958 --> 31:15.699
to some symphony benefit

31:15.743 --> 31:17.788
nonsense gala thing
that she loves

31:17.832 --> 31:19.790
so she doesn't have
to go alone or miss it.

31:19.834 --> 31:23.533
Um, no. No thanks. I'd rather
eat glass, thank you very much.

31:23.577 --> 31:24.752
Really? You'd rather eat glass?

31:24.795 --> 31:26.058
That's a little overdramatic.Really?

31:26.101 --> 31:27.929
I think, if anything,
it's under-dramatic.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.670
Allison and I went to
the Philip Glass Symphony once.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.846
Lawrence and I wanted to go.
Did you enjoy it?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.587
Not really.I don't care about
supporting the symphony.

31:33.630 --> 31:34.805
But you're not going
to support the symphony.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.590
You're going to support Mom.

31:36.633 --> 31:37.939
I've had a really bad day,

31:37.983 --> 31:39.854
week, and two-year stretch,
so, no,

31:39.898 --> 31:42.465
I'm not going with Mom to face
off with her mortal frenemies

31:42.509 --> 31:43.858
in ball gowns while she lies

31:43.902 --> 31:45.816
about her whole life
being so wonderful.

31:45.860 --> 31:49.472
Wow. Sounds like you really did
have a bad day. What happened?

31:49.516 --> 31:50.691
Don't encourage him.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.736
Why, thank you
for asking, Chuck.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.391
I'm sure Allison remembers
Brian McAtee?

31:55.435 --> 31:57.045
Yeah, he used to come into
the mini mart where I worked

31:57.089 --> 31:59.700
in high school
and shoplift beer for his dad.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.093
And you let him do that?

32:01.136 --> 32:04.139
Yeah, I'm the bad guy
in this story, babe.

32:04.183 --> 32:05.662
What about him?

32:05.706 --> 32:06.968
Oh, he's just missing,
on the run,

32:07.012 --> 32:08.752
wanted by the police,
and most likely,

32:08.796 --> 32:10.493
guilty and going
to jail forever.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.887
And I've been looking for him
everywhere, and cannot find him.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.890
So it's been super, super fun.
It's like a really great,

32:15.934 --> 32:18.023
awful weight on my shoulders
that I'll never be free of.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.720
Hooray!
Can I have the meat, please?

32:19.763 --> 32:21.156
I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.985
[door opens]MARGARET:
Todd? Todd, where are you?

32:24.029 --> 32:27.554
Ugh. I have been looking
everywhere for you.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.599
He's been right here
at dinner where you

32:29.643 --> 32:30.731
were supposed to be an hour
ago. I have left messages on
your voice machine. I...

32:30.774 --> 32:31.906
Look, I don't want
to hear it, okay?

32:31.950 --> 32:32.951
You were right about Brian,
all right?

32:32.994 --> 32:34.300
He's a big old loser.I know, but Todd, I hav

32:34.343 --> 32:35.518
to tell you something.He'll never have a house,

32:35.562 --> 32:36.911
he'll never have a normal life.But Todd...

32:36.955 --> 32:38.173
He'll never have a mudroom,
or a job

32:38.217 --> 32:39.174
that pays him six figures,
he'll never

32:39.218 --> 32:40.915
have a tie that you approve of.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.003
He's guilty, okay?Stop talking for five seconds,

32:42.047 --> 32:42.917
so I can...
No, Todd! No.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.050
Brian is innocent.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.712
Okay, so what are we doing here,
and what the hell is this?

32:55.756 --> 32:59.673
It's an HVAC, or an H-WHACK,
or I don't know. I don't know.

32:59.716 --> 33:03.198
Uh, it's the heating
and the air conditioning.

33:03.242 --> 33:06.506
And-and Brian's father told me
that he used to repair these.

33:06.549 --> 33:10.901
So, I looked up his record, and
turns out that he burglarized

33:10.945 --> 33:12.555
a bunch of businesses
that he serviced.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.905
Okay. Did he work
on this, here?

33:14.949 --> 33:17.038
I have no idea,
but my gut tells me

33:17.082 --> 33:19.127
that he broke
into this building,

33:19.171 --> 33:23.175
and this air... thing
helped him somehow.

33:23.218 --> 33:26.830
Huh. The pawn shop guy did say
his heating wasn't working.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.919
[gasps]
Yes. Good. Okay.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.573
Great. Get on up there!

33:30.617 --> 33:31.835
Get on up there?

33:31.879 --> 33:33.054
You shimmy up the side.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.795
What? What am I,
The Human Snake?

33:34.838 --> 33:38.059
Todd, he might have broken in
through that vent right there.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.061
So, go!All right. Uh, okay, look.

33:40.105 --> 33:43.151
Look, I'm gonna... Hang on.Yes. Oh.

33:43.195 --> 33:46.067
Good. Yes. Ladder. Smart.[mumbles]

33:46.111 --> 33:48.591
Okay. [groans]What? Oh, Todd, that's...

33:48.635 --> 33:50.245
You just stand there and
do nothing. I'll do everything.

33:50.289 --> 33:51.725
No, no, I'll help.
Just up here. Yes, up here.

33:51.768 --> 33:53.335
Just please help. I...

33:53.379 --> 33:55.859
Oh, good. That way.That's a real team
effort. Thanks, Mom.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.774
Appreciate it.Now be careful
you don't get a splinter,

33:57.818 --> 33:58.862
sweetheart.I got it.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.908
Yeah. That's it. Perfect.[groans]

34:02.127 --> 34:03.606
Good. Higher. Higher.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.913
All right.Yes. And now faster, faster.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.219
Hurry up. Go, go, go, go.

34:07.262 --> 34:08.916
And, uh, be careful.
Don't break your neck.

34:08.959 --> 34:11.136
Well, which is it? Go faster,
or don't break my neck?

34:11.179 --> 34:13.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can you hold this, please?

34:13.138 --> 34:14.748
Steady me?Okay. Go ahead.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.055
Okay. [groans]

34:18.056 --> 34:19.796
Good.[groans]

34:19.840 --> 34:22.625
[sighs]
Nope.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.888
No way any adult human
could fit in here.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.239
It's-it's a small hole.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.979
Okay, well, now take
that cover thing off

34:29.023 --> 34:30.633
and reach
around inside.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.113
Okay.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.723
Good.

34:33.767 --> 34:34.985
Stick your head in.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.117
Stick my head in?

34:36.161 --> 34:38.119
Uh-huh.[sighs]

34:38.163 --> 34:39.773
Squeeze on in there!

34:39.816 --> 34:40.948
It's too small!

34:40.991 --> 34:42.297
I'm telling you,
there's nothing in here.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.299
Do I have
to do everything myself?

34:44.343 --> 34:46.127
The one little thing
that I asked you to do.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.781
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?!

34:47.824 --> 34:49.174
I asked you to get in there.
That's what I asked you to do,

34:49.217 --> 34:50.305
is get in there.Do not climb up.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.002
This is not meant
for two people.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.134
And look inside
and look for evidence.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.309
That's what
I'm asking you to do.

34:54.353 --> 34:56.137
At least take my hand, please.Okay.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.747
Hold me. Hold me. Okay.I got you. I got you. Look.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.097
Okay.See for yourself.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.186
See? Nothing in there. What?[gasps]

35:01.229 --> 35:02.796
What is on your hand?

35:02.839 --> 35:05.320
I don't know. Toxic vent dust,

35:05.364 --> 35:06.843
orange asbestos.
Taste it.

35:06.887 --> 35:07.931
What?Taste it.

35:07.975 --> 35:10.325
No. Ew! It's...

35:10.369 --> 35:12.588
cheesy.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.895
Danny.Danny?

35:14.938 --> 35:18.072
Like Santa down the chimney.

35:19.291 --> 35:22.990
MARGARET:
So, let's talk about that night

35:23.033 --> 35:25.210
that you went for a ride
with Uncle Ray.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.562
You mean in Brian's car?

35:31.999 --> 35:33.870
Yes, sweetheart.

35:33.914 --> 35:37.352
In Brian's car.
Where did you go?

35:38.353 --> 35:43.053
If I tell you, Uncle Ray won't
play games with me anymore,

35:43.097 --> 35:45.230
and I like playing with him.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.712
You play games
with your Uncle Ray online?

35:51.366 --> 35:53.194
It's okay.

35:53.238 --> 35:55.327
Answer the question, Danny.

35:55.979 --> 35:58.939
We went
to help Uncle Ray's friend.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.159
What kind of help did he need?

36:01.202 --> 36:03.204
He locked himself
out of his store.Mm-hmm.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.207
So me and Uncle Ray needed
to get in the shop

36:06.251 --> 36:09.123
through the secret door
and bring him stuff.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.995
What, uh...
what kind of stuff?

36:12.039 --> 36:15.129
Money and coins, jewelry.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.088
As much as we could carry
without dropping.

36:18.132 --> 36:22.180
And where was that secret door
that led you down into the shop?

36:22.223 --> 36:24.399
In the back.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.096
It's small,

36:26.140 --> 36:27.402
but I went through the hole

36:27.446 --> 36:29.796
just like Uncle Ray taught me.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.060
It was pretty fun, I guess.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.064
[sighs]

36:37.717 --> 36:41.024
Is this because
Uncle Ray stole Brian's shoes?

36:41.068 --> 36:42.896
I told him he had

36:42.939 --> 36:45.028
to put them back.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.378
I'm sorry.

36:46.421 --> 36:50.817
Hey, it's okay, son.
It's okay. Come here.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.124
You didn't do
anything wrong.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.737
We have to find Brian.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.827
Did you call his new number?

37:01.828 --> 37:03.699
No.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.790
Well, what else was I gonna do?

37:07.834 --> 37:11.446
Not run. I was afraid you were
drunk somewhere in a ditch.

37:11.490 --> 37:14.449
Just... I didn't see a way out.

37:14.493 --> 37:17.191
It's... it's like I couldn't
handle the stress, man.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.280
Yeah, you definitely need
some better coping skills.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.413
And you got
to stay out of trouble.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.806
My mom's not always gonna
be around to bail you out

37:23.850 --> 37:26.983
and give you my ties.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.072
I'm gonna get
my act together.

37:29.116 --> 37:30.726
For real this time.Yeah.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.946
Gonna stop drinking.
I don't know.

37:32.989 --> 37:34.469
AA, group therapy.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.820
Maybe some
Anthony Robbins-like badge

37:37.864 --> 37:40.127
of personal achievement
kind of deal. [laughs]

37:40.170 --> 37:42.347
Whatever works.

37:43.043 --> 37:46.307
Hey, do you think
I could keep the tie?

37:48.091 --> 37:49.745
Considering
the recent developments,

37:49.789 --> 37:52.226
there's no reason to pursue
this matter any further.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.228
This case, along
with the violation

37:54.272 --> 37:56.274
of the terms
of the ankle monitor,

37:56.317 --> 37:59.277
is dismissed.[Brian and Margaret exhale]

38:03.063 --> 38:05.326
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Wright.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.241
How am I ever gonna repay you?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.504
Well, you could start
with no more trespassing.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.505
Gotcha.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.072
Be grateful for your uncle.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.421
On it.

38:13.465 --> 38:17.251
And Brian, I am... so sorry

38:17.295 --> 38:19.297
I didn't believe in you.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.234
Oh.Oh, hey.

38:44.278 --> 38:45.540
Hey. Hi.Hi.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.847
Your mom just texted me.
Brian's off the hook?

38:47.890 --> 38:51.154
Yes! Redeemed in the eyes
of society. For now.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.374
He'll be okay. For now.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.289
I can't believe
his own father was trying

38:55.333 --> 38:56.986
to frame him for a crime.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.466
Yeah, well, this is why
parenting is tricky,

38:58.510 --> 39:00.903
and why people shouldn't
have any more babies.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.906
No more babies.No! No more babies.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.299
Not for a while, no.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.083
I mean, why would you
want to bring a baby

39:07.127 --> 39:08.389
into the world right now?

39:08.433 --> 39:10.391
You're not having
a baby, are you?

39:10.435 --> 39:13.133
It's actually illegal
for you to be asking me that.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.178
Oh.But no, not yet.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.180
We are having a baby
in November.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.313
Huh?Of 2025.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.271
In three years.

39:21.315 --> 39:25.058
Oh. So, you have a plan,
like, a family plan?

39:25.101 --> 39:27.103
Yup, we have a plan.

39:27.147 --> 39:29.018
We?Yeah.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.064
I mean, without a plan,
how are we gonna frame this baby

39:31.107 --> 39:33.066
for a pawn shop heist?

39:33.109 --> 39:35.024
Right, well, try
to pull that off

39:35.068 --> 39:37.592
while it's still small enough
to crawl through a heating duct.

39:37.636 --> 39:40.160
I think they stay small
for a while.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.336
[elevator bell dings]

39:42.380 --> 39:44.991
Uh, anyway, gotta go.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.428
Sure.But, uh, congrats

39:47.472 --> 39:49.256
to "redeemed in the eyes
of society" Brian.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.866
Yeah.

39:50.910 --> 39:54.000
You-- not so much.

39:54.043 --> 39:57.003
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks a lot.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.456
Wow. You look great, Mom.

40:15.500 --> 40:19.982
Thanks. And Chuck's tux
almost fits you perfectly.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.375
Hmm.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.205
Are these for me?
These flowers

40:25.248 --> 40:28.991
that my neighbor, Mrs. Jackson,
threw in the trash last night?

40:29.035 --> 40:31.646
Well, they're still alive,
and they're new to you.

40:31.690 --> 40:34.475
Oh, uh, anything else
on that other matter?

40:34.519 --> 40:37.957
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Check this out.

40:39.567 --> 40:42.004
[laughing]:
Oh.

40:43.397 --> 40:45.443
Right now?

40:45.486 --> 40:48.054
[line ringing]

40:49.055 --> 40:54.190
Margaret! Oh, hello. Where are
you? Are you coming tonight?

40:54.234 --> 40:56.018
Hi, girls. Yes, of course.

40:56.062 --> 40:58.020
My date was late,
but he's just arrived.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.413
BOTH:
Date?

40:59.457 --> 41:00.936
What about Harry?Who is it?

41:00.980 --> 41:05.288
Oh, it's just a handsome
young man that I know.

41:05.332 --> 41:08.422
Harry and I... have split.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.033
But you knew that, didn't you?

41:11.077 --> 41:14.341
I mean, the way
you've been gossiping about me,

41:14.384 --> 41:17.300
all around town,
which is so unkind,

41:17.344 --> 41:19.215
and frankly, it's ill-advised.

41:19.259 --> 41:22.610
I mean, Desiree, how would
you feel if somebody found out

41:22.654 --> 41:26.048
that your husband
had been let go from a job

41:26.092 --> 41:27.659
because of
inappropriate behavior?

41:27.702 --> 41:29.095
Or...

41:29.138 --> 41:32.402
that you have been
having long lunches

41:32.446 --> 41:35.580
every afternoon
at The Heathman,

41:35.623 --> 41:37.320
oh, with Erica's husband?

41:37.364 --> 41:39.148
[laughs]TODD: Oh.

41:39.192 --> 41:41.324
See you at the gala, ladies!

41:41.368 --> 41:42.587
That was cold.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.590
[exhales] Ice-cold. Come.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.374
Wow.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.376
Ah.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.726
This is for you.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.120
Mm-hmm.

41:55.469 --> 41:58.385
It's your old copy
of Harriet the Spy.

41:58.428 --> 42:00.996
Wow! I didn't know
we still had this!

42:01.040 --> 42:03.303
Thank you. Thank you.

42:03.346 --> 42:05.523
Was this in one of my old boxes?

42:05.566 --> 42:08.438
Where are my boxes, by the way?

42:08.482 --> 42:11.746
You still have my stuff, right?

42:13.618 --> 42:15.271
You didn't throw my stuff away?

42:15.315 --> 42:17.447
Mom? It was only three boxes!

42:17.491 --> 42:20.755
It was four boxes.
