01:00.027 --> 01:01.795
[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:01.795 --> 01:05.032
You need to create
a farm-to-runway look.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.868
Who do you think
should go home?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.136
Yvie should go home.

01:09.136 --> 01:11.972
She's hurt,
and we ain't got time for that.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.441
I'm really pissed
that Silky would say that,

01:14.441 --> 01:17.577
especially when she saw me
finish that last challenge

01:17.577 --> 01:19.546
on a sprained ankle.

01:19.546 --> 01:20.614
Who do you think should go home?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.916
Silky Ganache.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.486
Why you pressed, ho?

01:26.486 --> 01:28.288
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.924
Tonight on the runway,
I am seeing the root.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.292
A'Keria.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.394
The shoulder pads, I hated them.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.896
[RuPaul] Plastique Tiara.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.433
Designers want you to emote
through the clothing,

01:39.433 --> 01:40.567
and I really got that from you.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.969
[RuPaul] Con-drag-ulations.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.004
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.138
[applause]

01:45.138 --> 01:47.841
A'Keria C. Davenport,
shantay you stay.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.242
Thank you so much.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.678
Ra'Jah O'Hara, sashay away.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.256
Oh, my God.
I got war wounds a mile deep.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.458
Whew.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.728
Ra'Jah is eliminated,
and I feel so bad.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.896
But I got my own struggles
right now.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.167
I really don't trust Yvie
in this competition,

02:14.167 --> 02:17.571
because I feel that
she view me as a threat.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.573
Now, with that being said,

02:19.573 --> 02:22.909
I have to keep a stern eye
on Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.945
For example,
Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes

02:24.945 --> 02:27.681
say that I should have been
in the bottom for my runway.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.849
No Tee, I thought
you were going to be

02:28.849 --> 02:31.051
in the bottom this week
for this look.

02:31.051 --> 02:33.553
But she let her good Judy Nina

02:33.553 --> 02:35.489
go out looking
the hot donkey fool

02:35.489 --> 02:37.057
and praised that bitch.

02:37.057 --> 02:40.093
How you feeling, Yvie,
off of all of your critiques?

02:40.093 --> 02:43.263
[Yvie] I got mostly
positive critiques.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.798
I like wanted to bring
a journey to the judges

02:44.798 --> 02:47.000
and show them that like
I can elevate my drag,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.638
despite how like anyone
may or may not feel.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.974
There's definitely tension.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.643
It's so thick you couldn't even
cut through it with a knife.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.145
You're gonna need a chainsaw.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.747
Silky, what are you thinking?
You're really quiet.

03:00.747 --> 03:03.450
For me as a person,
like, it's stressful.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.985
Ultimately, I'm just
tired of the fake.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.586
I'm tired of the phony.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.422
Who do you feel is being fake?

03:08.422 --> 03:11.458
I'm not even going to bring
that up at this moment.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.193
If you're a judge, you need
to be on the judges' panel.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.263
And that's all I got to say.

03:16.263 --> 03:19.266
Yvie has called me talentless.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.701
Talentless?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.570
You think safe
is gonna get you somewhere?

03:23.570 --> 03:25.238
Sasha Velour
was safe every week.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.440
And won.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.241
That's 'cause Sasha Velour
was talented.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.977
Oh, shit.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.479
Bitch, I'm from Chicago.

03:32.479 --> 03:34.481
When you called me talentless,

03:34.481 --> 03:36.249
I wanted to square up
with your ass.

03:37.617 --> 03:41.354
Before I was trying to be
at least cordial.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.323
Like I was cool with Yvie.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.559
But now I know we just
need to just let it go.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.560
Don't worry, girl.
I won't be giving you

03:46.560 --> 03:48.061
any more unasked-for advice.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.996
I'll just let you be in
the bottom if you go that way.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.465
[Vanjie]
Yeah, I don't need it.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.866
I mean, after just looking
at the skirt, I don't need it.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.501
I was trying to help you.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.502
Don't worry so much
about what I'm doing--

03:55.502 --> 03:56.703
I was trying to help you, sis.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.705
Being real with someone
isn't called being fake.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.941
Being fake? Girl,
one minute you're being kind

04:00.941 --> 04:02.676
and being cool, and that's
what I was talking about.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.078
People have
multiple feelings, girl.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.746
Just because
I'm being kind to you

04:06.746 --> 04:08.215
doesn't mean I'm not allowed
to be real.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.716
It ain't no feelings.
Multiple personalities.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.285
So how about you shut
the fuck up with your skirt,

04:12.285 --> 04:13.420
and whatever you--

04:13.420 --> 04:15.622
Okay. What else
are you going to repeat?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.557
Whatever I feel like
repeating, bitch.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.093
So shut the fuck up
and mind your business.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.362
She feels like I'm fake

04:22.362 --> 04:24.531
because I was kind to her
one minute,

04:24.531 --> 04:26.867
and then honest with her
the next.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.803
I didn't come here to lie
and sneak around corners,

04:29.803 --> 04:31.905
and I don't care
how incendiary that is.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.073
That's all I gotta say.
I don't give a shit.

04:33.073 --> 04:36.776
Guys, guys, guys.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.678
I know y'all have drama,
whatever,

04:38.678 --> 04:40.814
but let's take a moment
to celebrate the fact

04:40.814 --> 04:42.082
that this is
motherfucking top eight.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.985
Top eight and we love you

04:44.985 --> 04:47.220
and...and bye.

04:47.220 --> 04:51.191
I'm kind of tired of feeling
like some villain to them,

04:51.191 --> 04:53.560
when really I'm just
like the one bitch

04:53.560 --> 04:54.861
who's telling it like it is.

04:54.861 --> 04:58.331
Miss Vanjie
just let that bitch have it.

04:58.331 --> 05:02.369
We ain't going home for no
ratchet ho that drag cost $3.00.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.905
And I need to take that bitch
out, one way or the other.

you must have something

06:16.243 --> 06:18.612
Oh, wait.
I said that.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.146
Oh, they're here now.

10:13.146 --> 10:17.951
[cheers and applause]

10:17.951 --> 10:20.186
Oh, look, it's the
hardest-working queen

10:20.186 --> 10:22.355
in show business,
Morgan McMichaels.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.691
Ah, body.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.626
Listen, I love Postmates.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.295
-Why do you do it?
-I do it for the tips.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.298
You know, I've always relied
upon the kindness of strangers.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.400
Yes, I've heard.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.035
[all laugh]

10:36.035 --> 10:38.004
Well, I gotta go back to work.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.106
-Bye.
-Bye.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.407
Oh, Morgan.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.409
Haven't you forgotten
something, darling?

10:46.312 --> 10:47.580
[pop]

10:47.580 --> 10:51.951
[all laugh]

10:51.951 --> 10:54.287
I was wondering
where I left this.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.388
[all laugh]

10:55.388 --> 10:58.791
Ladies,
it's that time of year,

10:58.791 --> 11:01.594
and I sure hope your
charisma, uniqueness,

11:01.594 --> 11:04.197
nerve, and talent floats,

11:04.197 --> 11:09.168
because this season we're
playing the Snatch Game at Sea.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.870
[cheers and applause]

11:10.870 --> 11:12.071
Oh, my God.

11:12.071 --> 11:15.141
Brought to you
by our friends at Vacaya,

11:15.141 --> 11:19.212
a fresh new approach
to LGBT+ travel.

11:19.212 --> 11:23.616
With amazing destinations,
stellar entertainment,

11:23.616 --> 11:25.652
and world-class hospitality.

11:25.652 --> 11:29.489
Now, landlubber rules
still apply.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.624
You need to impersonate
a celebrity,

11:31.624 --> 11:35.128
play the game,
and make us laugh.

11:35.128 --> 11:40.533
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.503
[cheers and applause]

11:43.503 --> 11:46.339
Bitch! I've made it
to the Snatch Game.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.674
If you don't do good, bitch,

11:47.674 --> 11:49.576
everybody's going to remember
your Snatch Game,

11:49.576 --> 11:51.311
ain't no ifs, ands, or buts.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.946
Whatever you do
is going to follow you

11:52.946 --> 11:54.914
like the shadow
followed Peter Pan,

11:54.914 --> 11:58.184
and haunt you
till death do you part.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.023
When I curl synthetic hair,
does it go on a low setting?

12:04.023 --> 12:06.225
[Plastique]
The lowest setting possible.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.927
Our challenge today
is Snatch Game,

12:07.927 --> 12:09.495
and I cannot wait.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.730
I'm so excited.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.965
This is your strength, though.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.199
-I'm so excited for you.
-I hope so.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.034
I hope it's my strength.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.803
I don't want to jinx myself.

12:16.803 --> 12:17.904
It's going to be fun.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.072
This is a celebrity
impersonation.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.206
The whole goal of this

12:20.206 --> 12:21.507
is to be in character,
have fun,

12:21.507 --> 12:23.176
and make Ru laugh.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.677
I'm gonna curl this hair.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.045
[Yvie] Who are you thinking
about doing, girl?

12:26.045 --> 12:29.983
I'm going to do something
for my Latinos out there, Charo.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.985
-Charo.
-Yes.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.786
-La-cuchi-cuchi.
-[laughs]

12:33.786 --> 12:35.321
-Who you doing?
-Tiffany Haddish.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.390
-Is she from Girls Trip?
-Yeah.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.692
The one that was ready
to cut her bra if she needed to.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.693
Yeah.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.730
♪ She read, aah ♪

12:43.730 --> 12:45.264
-Oh, my snatch.
-The tricks, bitch.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.004
Impersonations are not exactly
my strongest suit.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.739
I'm freaking out a little bit.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.107
Or a lot bit.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.976
-Hi, boo-boo.
-Hey.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.745
-How are you?
-What's up?

12:58.745 --> 13:02.682
I'm just--I don't really do
a lot of characters ever,

13:02.682 --> 13:07.754
and so it just feels
like a mental block.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.023
It's just like...

13:10.023 --> 13:11.424
Sucks.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.660
Brooke Lynn is looking at me
with those googly eyes,

13:13.660 --> 13:16.462
and she's shook, 'cause
she doesn't think of herself

13:16.462 --> 13:17.730
as a funny queen.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.865
Who you gonna do?

13:18.865 --> 13:20.066
I think I'm gonna do
Celine Dion.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.934
-Celine Dion.
-Yeah.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.269
Is that your final answer?

13:23.269 --> 13:27.140
[both laugh]

13:27.140 --> 13:28.775
Last time
I had to do a character,

13:28.775 --> 13:30.443
it was Rosie...

13:30.443 --> 13:31.644
-O'Donnell.
-O'Donnell.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.880
I was gonna say Rosie Parks.
Rosie O'Donnell.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.348
You know that was not
my jush, either.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.749
I don't really do characters.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.352
Just be--you know,
make them laugh.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.420
Just don't
freak yourself out before.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.721
Yeah.

13:41.721 --> 13:42.689
Make them laugh, bitch,

13:42.689 --> 13:43.890
even if you're not doing Celine

13:43.890 --> 13:46.325
and you're doing Snoop Dogg
or whoever.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.827
While I'm telling her, bitch,
I'm telling myself, too.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.862
[sighs]

13:49.862 --> 13:51.664
Bitch, count to 25.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.032
If not 30.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.368
My ass had to count
to 40 the other night.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.636
And that didn't even
leave me nowhere.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.504
Don't freak yourself out.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.939
Come back later.

14:02.308 --> 14:03.776
Hey, cysts.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.379
We've got company.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.881
[screams]

14:08.881 --> 14:10.616
Yes! Jinkx Monsoon is here.

14:10.616 --> 14:14.420
Oh, you all look
absolutely fantastic, honestly.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.855
[all laugh]

14:15.855 --> 14:18.191
Jinkx won Season 5
of Drag Race,

14:18.191 --> 14:19.692
and she's in the history books

14:19.692 --> 14:22.962
for being one of the most
amazing Snatch Game winners

14:22.962 --> 14:24.097
as Little Edie.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.198
The label is faded.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.766
I can never tell if it's paté

14:26.766 --> 14:28.267
or if it's giblets
for the cats.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.802
[laughs]

14:29.802 --> 14:32.805
[RuPaul] Now, Jinkx Monsoon
is here

14:32.805 --> 14:35.575
to help you get shipshape
for the Snatch Game.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.211
Who's our first victim?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.615
Dr. Silky Ganache,
meet Jinkx Monsoon.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.883
-Hi.
-Hello, Jinkx.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.184
-How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.619
I'm wonderful.
How are you?

14:46.619 --> 14:48.354
Oh, I'm wonderful now, honey.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.289
So now please tell me

14:50.289 --> 14:53.760
you're going to be doing
Oprah's second cousin Cornetia.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.762
-[laughs]
-Cornetia Winfrey.

14:55.762 --> 14:56.963
Is that what you're doing?

14:56.963 --> 14:57.964
Very similar.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.565
-Well, who is it?
-Ts Madison.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.868
-You're doing Ts Madison?
-Yes.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.903
What a great choice for you.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.371
Welcome to my chateau.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.974
Yeah.

15:07.974 --> 15:11.177
She quits porn, so now
like a social media mogul,

15:11.177 --> 15:13.112
and she's everywhere
doing everything.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.580
Are you worried at all about--

15:14.580 --> 15:16.616
-No.
-[laughs]

15:16.616 --> 15:18.951
I think she gonna love me, and
I'm gonna become best friends,

15:18.951 --> 15:20.586
and we gonna have a good time.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.122
Now, Jinkx knows a thing or two
about Snatch Game.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.123
Do you have any questions
for her?

15:24.123 --> 15:25.324
I got a question for you.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.325
Mm-hmm.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.332
Can I get your phone number?

15:33.332 --> 15:35.935
Aah!
[all laugh]

15:35.935 --> 15:37.870
Dr. Ganache, I just never know

15:37.870 --> 15:39.572
what's going to come out
of your mouth.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.741
And that's a good quality
for Snatch Game,

15:41.741 --> 15:42.875
because you've gotta
keep it fresh.

15:42.875 --> 15:43.943
You've gotta keep it funny.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.044
Absolutely.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.546
You've got
such a big personality.

15:46.546 --> 15:50.650
And you filter that through
Ts Madison and you're golden.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.985
You know I'm gonna give you
everything, plus a little more.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.187
[RuPaul] You better.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.488
Listen, can't wait
to see you out there.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.323
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, Dr. Ganache.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.294
Oh, my wig.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.229
Yvie Oddly.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.832
Now, I see sort of
a dreadlock wig here.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.700
Are you going to do
Whoopi Goldberg?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.435
I am gonna do Whoopi Goldberg.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.037
Is this a strong character
for you?

16:11.037 --> 16:13.973
I don't do impersonations
very well.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.442
What would you say
your biggest strength is?

16:16.442 --> 16:19.412
I won the first acting challenge
that we had.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.247
-Yes.
-That's a good sign.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.449
Last week you surprised us
with this glam look.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.418
You looked really pretty.

16:25.418 --> 16:29.155
I didn't realize that
I wasn't turning any of that...

16:29.155 --> 16:30.356
[laughs] For y'all.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.557
Oh, bitch, come on.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.726
You know you were serving
freakazoid before.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.429
[laughs]
This all sounds so familiar.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.131
[RuPaul] Yes, that's right.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.200
So if you've already won
the acting challenge,

16:41.200 --> 16:43.002
you already know
what you're doing here.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.338
So if you can get yourself

16:45.338 --> 16:47.173
to where you've transformed
into Whoopi,

16:47.173 --> 16:51.077
and then you use your own
natural wit and cleverness,

16:51.077 --> 16:52.411
like I think you can handle it.

16:52.411 --> 16:55.147
You're funny.
You're already funny.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.716
So just make me
fucking laugh, Yvie.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.817
Okay. Thank you.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.086
Thank you. Bye.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.756
-Hello.
-Brooke Lynn Hytes,

17:03.756 --> 17:05.291
meet Jinkx Monsoon.

17:05.291 --> 17:08.628
You know, Jinkx
is a Snatch Game assassin.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.097
Now, we're here
to guess who you're doing.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.698
So don't tell me
because I want to guess.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.900
I see a white jacket.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.101
Sammy Davis Jr.?

17:15.101 --> 17:16.903
[all laugh]

17:16.903 --> 17:18.004
Celine Dion?

17:18.004 --> 17:19.238
-Thank you.
-Is it?

17:19.238 --> 17:20.306
You are doing Celine.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.341
[Brooke Lynn] Celine, yeah.

17:22.341 --> 17:23.776
Do you have Celine's voice down?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.678
Because that's really
the most important part, right?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.179
Yeah, the accent,
the French Canadian accent.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.247
Uh-huh.

17:28.247 --> 17:29.582
Yeah, 'ello, 'ow are you?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.651
It's good to see you, Jinkx.
You look beautiful.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.723
Um, she's trying.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.625
-Do you feel good?
-I feel good.

17:40.860 --> 17:44.297
My heart will go on.
Love you.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.233
How about this. Celine,
what'd you have for lunch?

17:47.233 --> 17:49.068
Poutine.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.537
-Poutine.
-Poutine.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.572
It's a French-Canadian delicacy.
You will love it.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.075
It's French fries
with cheese curd and gravy.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.643
It's amazing!

17:57.643 --> 17:59.078
Hilarious.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.146
-Really?
-No.

18:00.146 --> 18:03.449
I--to be completely honest
with you,

18:03.449 --> 18:05.751
I'm just not feeling
super confident about any of it.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.553
I just feel like
I have a mental block.

18:07.553 --> 18:08.654
It's just...

18:08.654 --> 18:10.856
Sometimes also
an over-exaggeration

18:10.856 --> 18:15.294
can make up for maybe you're
not the best at doing her voice.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.929
-Yeah.
-I love doing Bette Davis,

18:16.929 --> 18:18.297
but it's not accurate.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.633
It's just me going, ahh...

18:20.633 --> 18:23.436
ahh...as much as I can.

18:23.436 --> 18:26.038
It works.
That works.

18:26.038 --> 18:29.075
I see the worry in your eyes.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.576
Can't wait to take a Xanax
after we finish.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.244
[RuPaul] All right, all right.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.579
-We'll see you out there.
-Thank you, Ru.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.114
Come on, Jinkx.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.449
I'm gonna die.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.387
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi, Ru. How are you?

18:41.387 --> 18:42.455
Meet Jinkxy.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.756
-Hi, Jinkx.
-Hi, Nina.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.792
So, now, Nina, you're
a comedy theater queen.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.094
I am.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.596
I would think that
if anybody in this workroom

18:50.596 --> 18:53.199
knows what Snatch Game is,
it would be you.

18:53.199 --> 18:56.469
I think so.
This is improv, riffing,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.404
and it's knowing your character
and trying to make you laugh.

18:58.404 --> 18:59.505
[RuPaul] Yeah, I love to laugh.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.639
Which is really
what I want to do.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.308
You know,
even if it's halfway funny,

19:02.308 --> 19:03.809
I'll fucking laugh. True.

19:03.809 --> 19:04.910
[all laugh]

19:04.910 --> 19:06.679
I have brought--

19:06.679 --> 19:08.014
I'm between
two different characters

19:08.014 --> 19:10.116
who I think I can embody.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.184
Is that Betty Rubble?

19:12.184 --> 19:13.753
Close. Jo Anne Worley.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.088
Oh, oh, Jo Anne ♪ Worley ♪

19:16.088 --> 19:17.256
-♪ Worley ♪ Yeah.
-Yes.

19:17.256 --> 19:19.792
And is that Eleanor Parker?

19:19.792 --> 19:21.661
Close. [deep voice]
Harvey Fierstein.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.496
-Yeah.
-Yes.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.831
I'm trying to decide
really between the two,

19:25.831 --> 19:28.701
and what's going to be
the best decision.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.103
A lot of the kids
watching this show these days,

19:31.103 --> 19:32.772
they're not going to know
either of these people.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.774
-Right.
-Now you have to do it so well

19:34.774 --> 19:37.443
that even though they don't know
who these people are,

19:37.443 --> 19:38.644
they're going to laugh at it

19:38.644 --> 19:39.945
just because
it's a good performance.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.380
When I did Little Edie,

19:41.380 --> 19:45.351
I had certain things that I knew
that I could always go to.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.154
I could always go to the cat tin
and talk about cat food

19:48.154 --> 19:50.990
and I could always say
her certain catchphrases.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.459
But I also had to be able
to go on the fly.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.194
So I had to be able
to just trust

19:55.194 --> 19:57.596
that if I stay in character,
I could say something

19:57.596 --> 19:59.065
that Little Edie probably
never would have said,

19:59.065 --> 20:01.967
like she goes into
the voting booth in seizures.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.603
Spelling? You know,
she never said that.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.872
But it's a funny thing
that I did in character.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.274
-And it's in her character.
-Yeah.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.875
I mean, she would say that.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.479
Listen, I can't wait to see one
of these characters out there.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.947
And make me laugh.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.382
-I'm gonna try.
-All right.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.583
So nice to meet you.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.884
Nice to meet you, too.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.252
I'm torn between
these two characters.

20:20.252 --> 20:21.654
I'm not sure
what I'm going to do.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.988
But if I'm going to make
a bold decision,

20:22.988 --> 20:24.323
this is where I need to do it.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.059
[sighs] Now what do I do?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.295
[RuPaul] Hello, Miss--

20:29.295 --> 20:31.130
Vanjie.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.865
Oh, Miss Vanjie.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.867
[laughs]

20:34.867 --> 20:36.635
So now I see a red wig here.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.170
Is it Lindsay Lohan?

20:38.170 --> 20:41.107
It's not Lindsay.
She was on Dr. Phil,

20:41.107 --> 20:43.309
the little "cash me outside"
viral girl.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.244
-Oh, yes.
-Danielle Bregoli, yes.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.180
Well, what are you going to do
besides cash me outside?

20:48.180 --> 20:49.482
It's just basically
acting like her.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.151
I was going to address RuPaul
as Dr. Phil.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.452
Stuff like that.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.621
That sounds like
a goddamn laugh riot.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.756
It's not funny talking about it.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.258
It's funny acting, I guess.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.960
You know what?
Everybody says that.

21:00.960 --> 21:06.565
Because on your audition reel,
you had L.A. Toya.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.734
Did you think about doing
Latoya Jackson?

21:08.734 --> 21:09.835
No, I'm not doing
Latoya Jackson.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.036
Why not?

21:11.036 --> 21:12.571
Because I know
she's friends of the show,

21:12.571 --> 21:14.473
so I didn't--and then I would
have felt like uncomfortable,

21:14.473 --> 21:15.808
probably stepping over
those bounds.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.876
Oh, please, bitch.
If you're doing it with love,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.677
there's no disrespect.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.380
I just--the most person
I would be able to for me

21:21.380 --> 21:25.751
I feel like turning it out
when I'm on set would be her.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.587
And her whole thing
is that she's a rebellious kid

21:28.587 --> 21:31.423
who is--bucks authority,
is that the thing?

21:31.423 --> 21:33.993
Remember, Detox playing Ke$ha,

21:33.993 --> 21:36.061
took a pee on stage.

21:36.061 --> 21:39.165
It was like, how are we supposed
to laugh at that, you know?

21:39.165 --> 21:41.267
And Detox learned
a big lesson from that,

21:41.267 --> 21:43.869
that like just going for
the lowest common dominator

21:43.869 --> 21:46.038
doesn't always cut it
if you've got someone else

21:46.038 --> 21:48.007
doing a sophisticated
performance

21:48.007 --> 21:48.974
up against you, you know.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.212
Now you done flipped the script,

21:53.212 --> 21:55.014
got me over here,
don't know what to do.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.082
I'm about to go back through
my luggages again

21:57.082 --> 21:58.784
and figure out
what I'm about to pull.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.553
No, it's up to you, honestly.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.421
It's just we're just questioning

22:02.421 --> 22:04.857
your ability to make
this character come to life.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.659
You've seen Snatch Game before.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.860
[buzz buzz buzz]

22:07.860 --> 22:10.563
You know what happens
on Snatch Game.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.764
Make it funny.

22:11.764 --> 22:12.965
Can you do a character
that's just that?

22:12.965 --> 22:15.000
That already was
the funniest thing you did.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.336
[RuPaul] Funniest thing
of the day.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.771
Well, you decide.
Can't wait to see you out there.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.805
[Vanjie] Okay.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.273
[RuPaul] Thank you, Vanessa.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.210
Bitch, I'm shook, scared,

22:24.210 --> 22:27.012
panicking,
stand-still mannequin.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.715
I don't know what the fuck
gonna happen now.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.953
-Hello, Plastique.
-Hi, Ru.

22:33.953 --> 22:34.987
Meet Jinkx Monsoon.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.021
-Hi, Jinkx.
-Hi.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.156
So good to meet you.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.524
There's
an unaccompanied minor here?

22:38.524 --> 22:39.692
[all laugh]

22:39.692 --> 22:43.262
[Asian accent]
Hello. Good to see you.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.497
Oh, my goodness,
are you in character now?

22:45.497 --> 22:46.732
Yes, yes, I am.

22:46.732 --> 22:48.100
[RuPaul] Who are you doing?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.336
I'm actually going to do
Lovely Mimi.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.971
She's on Love & Hip Hop.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.372
She's like this nail tech
from Atlanta,

22:53.372 --> 22:55.941
but she's like--
she pulls out an accent.

22:55.941 --> 22:57.776
She jumps in and out
of that Asian character.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.111
But how different is she

22:59.111 --> 23:02.081
from the nail lady
you performed in the Wakanda?

23:02.081 --> 23:04.583
She's a little different,
because like, you know--

23:04.583 --> 23:06.285
A little different or--

23:06.285 --> 23:07.586
A little different.

23:07.586 --> 23:09.989
So she jumps in and out
of different dialects.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.390
What's her other dialect?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.659
-Is she very 'hood, also?
-Yeah, she's very 'hood.

23:13.659 --> 23:16.895
Can I hear a little bit
of your 'hood voice?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.097
Where you wanna go
to lunch?

23:18.097 --> 23:19.898
Lady Bunny's Glory Holes.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.735
Well, it feels like you've got

23:22.735 --> 23:24.470
one half of this character down.

23:24.470 --> 23:25.904
[RuPaul] Yeah.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.640
But it kind of sounds like
you've done it before.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.341
Are you a one-trick pony?

23:29.341 --> 23:32.411
I've done it before,
but I stick to my guns.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.046
I know that
I can do this really well.

23:34.046 --> 23:35.347
I know that I can do the accent.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.116
This is actually my drag voice.

23:37.116 --> 23:40.286
[laughs] The accent
is actually my real voice.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.186
Yeah.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.928
Your challenge
is to not be exactly like

23:49.928 --> 23:52.464
Why it Gotta Be Black?
and also make me laugh.

23:52.464 --> 23:53.599
Yes.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.301
Plastique already
did this character

23:55.301 --> 23:56.635
in Why it Gotta Be Black,
Panther?

23:56.635 --> 23:59.538
Plastique did this character
in mini challenges.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.974
Plastique has did this character
walking around the workroom.

24:01.974 --> 24:05.444
I guess Plastique's gonna try
to do this character again.

24:05.444 --> 24:08.180
All right, ladies.
Look, y'all,

24:08.180 --> 24:09.481
I don't care how you do it.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.551
You just better make us laugh.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.086
Bon voyage,

24:14.086 --> 24:18.657
and don't fuck it up.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.026
[cheers and applause]

24:21.026 --> 24:22.127
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.562
Shall we, darling?

24:23.562 --> 24:26.098
-Thank you, Jinkx.
-Bye, y'all.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.902
[Michelle]
It's Snatch Game at Sea,

24:29.902 --> 24:31.603
brought to you by Vacaya,

24:31.603 --> 24:35.574
a fresh new approach
to LGBT+ vacations.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.543
How do you Vacaya?

24:37.543 --> 24:41.180
Welcome aboard.
We've been expecting you.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.717
Let's meet our Snatch Game
at Sea contestants.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.453
Our first guest
loves escape rooms.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.487
It's Clea DuVall.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.356
-Hi, Ru.
-You look fantastic.

24:50.356 --> 24:51.523
Thank you.
So do you.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.392
Good luck
getting out of here alive.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.194
I never want to.
[all laugh]

24:55.194 --> 24:58.530
Now, our next guest
is obsessed with cruise ships.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.966
Welcome Tony Hale.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.801
Hello. I love cruises.

25:02.801 --> 25:06.105
It's like a floating mall,
and the food feels free.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.574
Well, there's
no shopping on this ship,

25:08.574 --> 25:09.608
only mopping.

25:09.608 --> 25:10.743
Bummer.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.311
All hands on deck.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.446
Let's meet our stars.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.217
First up,
a social media maven

25:18.217 --> 25:21.286
who has stepped her pussy
all the way up.

25:21.286 --> 25:22.921
Ts Madison is here.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.490
-Is it on?
-Yes.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.758
Is it on?

25:25.758 --> 25:28.594
The question of the day
and every single day

25:28.594 --> 25:31.563
is this bitch recording?

25:31.563 --> 25:33.599
[laughs]

25:35.334 --> 25:37.803
Good morning, Baltimore.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.906
It's Broadway's
Harvey Fierstein. Hello.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.242
-I want to clear things up.
-Okay.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.445
-I'm not Harvey Weinstein.
-No, you're not.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.781
The only thing I've assaulted
is a cheese plate.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.984
Yes. [laughs]

25:51.984 --> 25:55.587
Now, all the way from
Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,

25:55.587 --> 25:59.024
it's Instagram superstar
Lovely Mimi.

25:59.024 --> 26:02.127
Hi, Lovely Mimi
in the house.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.963
Hi, Mimi.
Would you do my nails?

26:04.963 --> 26:06.932
Any day of the week, honey.
Come in.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.334
I do the cuticle.
I do the extension.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.969
-Everything for you.
-Oh, wow.

26:10.969 --> 26:11.904
[Silky] Let me tell you
something, RuPaul.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.105
Oh, what's that?

26:13.105 --> 26:15.040
I let Mimi do my nails
in Atlanta, bitch.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.843
I was the first bitch bitch
walking around Atlanta

26:17.843 --> 26:19.211
with athlete's feet on my hands.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.313
Don't you trust Mimi, honey.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.448
Don't do it.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.149
I will check you, ho.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.018
This one's got two voices.

26:26.018 --> 26:30.322
Next up,
she won an Emmy, a Grammy,

26:30.322 --> 26:32.724
an Oscar, and a Tony.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.193
It's Whoopi Goldberg,
everybody.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.527
Hey, Whoopi.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.362
You know, it's funny
that you should mention that

26:37.362 --> 26:39.031
because I actually brought them
all here with me.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.900
Oh, those are
all of your awards.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.535
Yes. Trying
to get rid of them on eBay

26:43.535 --> 26:47.739
since I haven't had a role in a
good five or six thousand years.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.875
Aren't you on The View?

26:49.875 --> 26:52.911
I am on The View, but after
interacting with these ladies,

26:52.911 --> 26:55.814
something tells me I'm gonna
quit show biz altogether.

26:55.814 --> 26:58.083
[RuPaul] All right, up next,

26:58.083 --> 26:59.685
it wouldn't be a cruise
without her.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.386
My good friend Charo is here.

27:01.386 --> 27:04.623
Hola, RuPaul.
It's so nice to be here.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.024
Can I get one cuchi-cuchi?

27:06.024 --> 27:08.861
Oh, claro que sí.
Oh, cuchi-cuchi-cuchi.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.463
[all laugh]

27:11.463 --> 27:14.733
Up next, we've got someone
that you know from Dr. Phil.

27:14.733 --> 27:18.203
Problem child Danielle Bregoli
is here.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.304
What's up, Dr. Phil?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.607
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
What's up, Ru?

27:21.607 --> 27:24.243
Are you gonna behave here
on the Snatch Game?

27:24.243 --> 27:25.744
-Fuck no.
-You're not gonna behave.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.746
No. This fucker
is ratchet as fuck

27:27.746 --> 27:30.082
and knocked my mom out
a few times.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.517
I had to beat her ass,

27:31.517 --> 27:32.951
and now I'm here
trying to get this check.

27:32.951 --> 27:34.520
[RuPaul] Yeah, good, good.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.922
Up next,
from the movie Girls Trip,

27:36.922 --> 27:39.858
the hilarious Tiffany Haddish
is here.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.127
I hope you went to the ladies
room before we started the show.

27:42.127 --> 27:45.164
Oh, there'll be no
golden showers as of right now.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.266
[laughs] Tell me this.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.068
Now, I know you became close
friends with Will and Jada.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.937
-How they doing, girl?
-Girl, listen.

27:51.937 --> 27:53.572
I had tried to take them
on a boat trip

27:53.572 --> 27:55.507
that I had bought on Rupon--

27:55.507 --> 27:56.742
'cause you can't say
the other thing.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.310
[all laugh]

27:58.310 --> 28:00.712
And girl, everybody wanted to
take pictures of Will and Jada,

28:00.712 --> 28:03.415
and I just felt
so non-celebrity-like.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.449
Oh, dear.

28:04.449 --> 28:05.584
-But, girl, guess what?
-What?

28:05.584 --> 28:07.252
I still got my Rupon.

28:07.252 --> 28:08.687
[laughs]

28:08.687 --> 28:10.989
She's calling it Rupon.

28:10.989 --> 28:13.125
[laughs]

28:13.125 --> 28:15.394
A'Keria as Tiffany Haddish
was spot-on.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.262
Yes, ma'am.
Y'all caught that mug.

28:17.262 --> 28:18.931
[RuPaul] Last but not least,

28:18.931 --> 28:23.435
oh, my goodness, one of my
favorite voices of all time.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.270
Celine Dion is here.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.806
I'm a little bit confused.
I'm not sure why I'm here.

28:27.806 --> 28:31.743
I thought this was a Titanic
20th anniversary reunion.

28:31.743 --> 28:32.945
Oh, no.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.079
I don't know
who any of these people are.

28:34.079 --> 28:35.147
I know.
There is a nautical theme--

28:35.147 --> 28:36.348
Is it Alzheimer's?

28:36.348 --> 28:38.050
You got Alzheimer's, baby?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.752
-No, baby, no.
-But you--

28:40.752 --> 28:42.054
I have a show in Vegas, though.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.555
[RuPaul] Let's see
how the show goes,

28:43.555 --> 28:46.725
because it might end up
like the Titanic, actually.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.194
All right,
let's play the game.

28:49.194 --> 28:51.463
First question is for Tony Hale.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.633
Bianca Del Rio is so mean.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.836
Recently when someone yelled
"man overboard,"

28:57.836 --> 29:00.172
she didn't throw
a life preserver,

29:00.172 --> 29:01.273
she threw blank.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.277
Another man.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.979
-She threw another man.
-Yeah.

29:06.979 --> 29:08.480
All right, let's go
to the celebrities

29:08.480 --> 29:09.815
and see if you got a match,
okay?

29:09.815 --> 29:11.583
Let's start with Ts Madison.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.419
Bianca Del Rio is so mean,
she threw what?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.054
I threw over a ruler, bitch,

29:16.054 --> 29:17.990
to make sure
you had nine inches.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.225
And if you didn't have
nine inches,

29:20.225 --> 29:22.694
I wasn't saving you, 'cause
you wasn't worth anything.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.197
Tony, you got nine inches
over there?

29:25.197 --> 29:26.865
Ooh, we're not gonna go there.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.000
[all laugh]

29:28.000 --> 29:31.003
Let's move on down
to Lovely Mimi.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.972
You know, Bianca Del Rio
is so mean,

29:33.972 --> 29:36.942
she throwed the Ts Madison
at the man.

29:36.942 --> 29:40.612
Girl, can you imagine,
she go overboard?

29:40.612 --> 29:44.316
She go to the bottom
and die forever.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.785
She just mad that her nails
are bad and I told everybody.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.521
Okay, that's not a match,
but a very good try.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.689
[audience] Aw...

29:50.689 --> 29:52.891
Let's move on down
to Danielle Bregoli.

29:52.891 --> 29:54.459
-What say you?
-Dr. Phil--

29:54.459 --> 29:57.763
I mean, Ru, stolen credit cards
from her mama,

29:57.763 --> 29:59.831
because that's
what the fuck I did.

29:59.831 --> 30:01.767
-And I'm here.
-Okay.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.402
All right.
Not a match, not a match.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.803
Why you looking at me
like that, though?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.338
No, it was close.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.106
-Cash me outside, then.
-All right, all right.

30:08.106 --> 30:09.307
Cash me outside, how 'bout that?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.009
-I don't want to.
-Well, you're not angry.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.411
-You're not angry.
-No, I'm not angry.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.212
-All right, hey.
-What's up?

30:14.212 --> 30:15.614
Hey, guys, it's gonna go down.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.948
[Shuga] Vanjie
is messing with Tony,

30:16.948 --> 30:20.552
and I can tell
that he is afraid, honey.

30:20.552 --> 30:21.620
I ain't scared of you.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.088
I whoop my mama.
I'll whoop you, too.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.256
[all laugh]

30:24.256 --> 30:26.425
Let's see
if the greatest voice on earth,

30:26.425 --> 30:28.827
Celine Dion,
has a match for you.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.495
I wrote the Heart of the Ocean.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.964
That's the necklace
from the movie.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.366
I am so angry.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.501
It took them 20--it took them
100 years to find it.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.236
-Yes.
-They got it out of the ocean,

30:38.236 --> 30:39.504
and she throw it back in.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.106
-She threw it back in.
-Yes.

30:41.106 --> 30:44.076
Unfortunately for Tony,
that is not a match.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.544
Celine Dion,
you have so many hits.

30:45.544 --> 30:49.081
Is there one song in particular
that you love the most?

30:49.081 --> 30:52.117
My favorite song to sing is
All Coming Back to Me Now.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.752
Why?

30:53.752 --> 30:55.987
Because the music
and the passion,

30:55.987 --> 30:58.724
it just draws me in,
and I feel so alive

30:58.724 --> 31:01.026
when I sing that song.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.861
Where's the Celine?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.696
It ain't even Celine Dion
anymore.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.798
It's Celine You're-done.

31:06.798 --> 31:09.668
All right, this next question
is for Clea DuVall.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.503
Lady Bunny is so thirsty,

31:11.503 --> 31:15.540
instead of portholes
in her cabin, she has blank.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.310
[RuPaul]
What does Lady Bunny have

31:18.310 --> 31:20.846
instead of portholes
in her cabin?

31:20.846 --> 31:23.348
-Manholes.
-That's a good answer.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.817
Let's go to our celebrities
and hear what they have to say.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.519
Harvey Fierstein, what say you?

31:27.519 --> 31:28.987
Well, I've known Bunny
for years.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.322
She's a New York queen.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.124
-I'm a New York queen.
-Yeah.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.225
Gloryholes.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.961
Judges,
is that same as a manhole?

31:35.961 --> 31:38.029
-You need a man.
-Unfortunately not.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.598
You do need a man for this.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.533
But that is a very good answer,
Harvey Fierstein.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.669
Let's go down
to Whoopi Goldberg.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.004
What do you have?

31:46.004 --> 31:49.207
I just wrote old movies
I had winning roles in.

31:49.207 --> 31:52.377
Because there's really nothing
like enjoying The Color Purple.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.379
In fact, my feet
are still dirty from it,

31:54.379 --> 31:57.249
to be 100% honest.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.984
[RuPaul] Okay, yeah.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.253
Let's move on down to Charo,
cuchi-cuchi Charo.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.554
Cuchi-cuchi.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.222
[RuPaul] Charo,
what does Lady Bunny have

32:04.222 --> 32:06.424
instead of portholes
in her cabin?

32:06.424 --> 32:07.726
I said Mazola.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.328
It is the oil for the corn.

32:10.328 --> 32:14.266
But you put it in your skin,
then you can slip around in it.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.067
You know, slip in your partner.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.702
And then cook a taco.

32:17.702 --> 32:19.404
And cook a taco.
That's a good answer.

32:19.404 --> 32:22.174
Not a match,
unfortunately, Charo.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.042
Tiffany Haddish,
we're looking for a manhole.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.377
What do you have?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.612
I said she has a little man
she can grapefruit.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.847
See, what you do, Ru--

32:28.847 --> 32:29.848
-Oh, oh, oh, oh.
-You cut the side,

32:29.848 --> 32:30.849
and you cut the side.

32:30.849 --> 32:31.850
What do you do with that?

32:31.850 --> 32:34.085
Oh. [laughs]

32:36.755 --> 32:40.492
All right,
so we're gonna do a bonus round.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.394
Clea and Tony
will play together.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.562
Here we go.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.231
Nicki Minaj loves
going to the beach.

32:46.231 --> 32:49.768
Her hair always stays dry,
but her blank don't.

32:53.171 --> 32:54.472
But her...

32:54.472 --> 32:56.308
Badonkadonk don't.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.043
-But her badonkadonk.
-Don't.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.411
Don't. Okay.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.912
We're looking for badonkadonk,
celebrities.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.581
Oh, Jo Anne Worley is here.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.450
♪ Ooh, aah ♪
Hello.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.219
The stars are here.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.087
All right, so we're looking
for badonkadonk.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.388
I want you to know

33:10.388 --> 33:12.490
my answer is coming
from a lot of experience

33:12.490 --> 33:13.758
with working with dicks.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.761
-Dick Martin.
-Dick Martin from Laugh In.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.163
[Nina] Dick Nixon.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.364
I've worked with so many dicks,

33:19.364 --> 33:21.166
I think Paul Lynde
really outdid me, though.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.968
♪ Oh ♪

33:22.968 --> 33:23.969
I want you to know.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.270
[RuPaul] Snatchword.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.371
Cantaloupe.

33:26.371 --> 33:27.572
Fruit.

33:27.572 --> 33:28.573
Honeydew.

33:28.573 --> 33:29.574
Melon.

33:29.574 --> 33:31.476
Aah! Melons, that's melons.

33:31.476 --> 33:32.878
It's not a badonkadonk.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.513
No, it's down here.
It's down here, yeah.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.481
Oh.

33:36.481 --> 33:37.582
Melons would be here.

33:37.582 --> 33:39.684
So unfortunately,
that is not a match.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.588
Now, Ts Madison, are you
familiar with the badonk--

33:43.588 --> 33:44.823
Oh, you've got a new hairdo.

33:44.823 --> 33:45.957
Girl, let me tell you
something.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.292
If you ain't rocking 22 inches,

33:47.292 --> 33:48.994
you practically bald, bitch.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.896
You practically bald.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.731
[laughs] 22 inches.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.634
[Silky] 22 inches. I got to
keep cashing in your check.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.102
[RuPaul] Yes, honey.
All right, now what say you?

33:57.102 --> 33:58.803
Anaconda, honey.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.406
Let me tell you, you ain't
rocking at least nine inches,

34:01.406 --> 34:02.974
you can't rock with me, bitch.

34:02.974 --> 34:05.343
-[laughs]
-Nine inches, honey.

34:05.343 --> 34:07.445
Silky as Ts Madison
is killing it, girl.

34:07.445 --> 34:10.815
She is the captain of this
cruise ship right now, girl.

34:10.815 --> 34:14.252
Let's move on down
to Whoopi Goldberg.

34:14.252 --> 34:17.489
Any time I go to the beach,
I make sure to medicate.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.457
And so much like Nicki,

34:19.457 --> 34:24.129
I know that her joints,
her joints are always wet.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.501
If you're not about it,
then you're against it,

34:29.501 --> 34:34.105
because the devil's lettuce
is actually God's gift.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.340
What the hell is going on?

34:35.340 --> 34:38.009
I was actually
looking at her like this.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.245
Whoopi,
then I looked at RuPaul.

34:40.245 --> 34:44.349
Baby, when I tell you,
eee...poof.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.018
[RuPaul] All right,
let's move on to Charo.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.220
We're looking for badonkadonk.

34:49.220 --> 34:51.923
Took me a minute to understand
what the badonkadonk is,

34:51.923 --> 34:54.259
because my English is good,
but not that good.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.860
No, your English is very good.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.596
Listen, people telling me
that my accent is fake,

34:58.596 --> 35:00.865
They tell me, oh, no,
Charo is from Cincinnati.

35:00.865 --> 35:01.866
[laughs]

35:01.866 --> 35:03.735
Do not miscon-screw me.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.236
I am from España.

35:05.236 --> 35:06.671
[RuPaul] What say you, Charo?

And it weighs like 50 pounds.

43:56.334 --> 43:57.802
I can barely walk in the bitch,

43:57.802 --> 44:01.539
but I will be taking
a slow strut on the runway.

44:01.539 --> 44:03.341
[RuPaul]
I love this dress so much.

44:03.341 --> 44:07.111
If I wore this dress,
it would be La Isla Boniva.

44:07.111 --> 44:09.380
[all laugh]

44:09.380 --> 44:11.516
[Ross] #Eggplant.

44:11.516 --> 44:13.351
[laughs]

44:13.351 --> 44:15.119
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

44:15.119 --> 44:17.788
[Michelle]
All right, Pam Queer.

44:17.788 --> 44:20.391
-Oh!
-Aah!

44:20.391 --> 44:22.293
[RuPaul] Oh, my God.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.594
Are you kidding me?

44:23.594 --> 44:25.363
-Yeah.
-What?

44:25.363 --> 44:28.299
-How you doing?
-Yes, bitch.

44:28.299 --> 44:31.068
[RuPaul] You better
motherfucking work, bitch.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.036
[Brooke Lynn]
I fucked up Snatch Game,

44:32.036 --> 44:33.371
and it was terrible.

44:33.371 --> 44:35.206
And I know I'm getting read
to filth for it.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.108
So I'm pulling out
all the stops.

44:37.108 --> 44:39.911
I need to fucking
light that runway on fire.

44:39.911 --> 44:42.980
-Whoa!
-Oh!

44:42.980 --> 44:44.782
[Brooke Lynn]
RuPaul is gagged.

44:44.782 --> 44:47.018
Everyone is gagged.
Yes, I did it.

44:47.018 --> 44:48.553
[Michelle] I guess blondes
really do have more fun.

44:48.553 --> 44:50.388
[RuPaul] Oh, yes.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.456
She went from Crooklyn
to Brooke Lynn.

44:52.456 --> 44:53.824
[all laugh]

44:53.824 --> 44:55.860
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

44:55.860 --> 44:56.994
[Ross] Pantsuit of many colors.

44:56.994 --> 44:59.130
-Yes.
-David Ho-wie.

44:59.130 --> 45:00.598
[all laugh]

45:00.598 --> 45:02.199
[Yvie]
My sequins might be shiny,

45:02.199 --> 45:04.435
but they're also nitty gritty.

45:04.435 --> 45:09.073
I'm serving the best Peg Bundy
androgynous sixties Barbie.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.642
[RuPaul] Oh, I see.
This outfit was 25% off.

45:11.642 --> 45:12.677
-Ah.
-Okay.

45:12.677 --> 45:13.911
[Ross] I love a look

45:13.911 --> 45:15.446
that really shows off
a girl's assets.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.815
[RuPaul] Yes. Cheeky devil.

45:17.815 --> 45:20.952
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

45:20.952 --> 45:23.487
[Michelle] Why don't you
come up and seaweed sometime?

45:23.487 --> 45:24.789
[all laugh]

45:24.789 --> 45:27.225
[Silky] I am channeling
my two favorite divas:

45:27.225 --> 45:30.895
Miss Aretha Franklin
and Diana Ross.

45:30.895 --> 45:33.798
If they had come together
to make one big baby,

45:33.798 --> 45:35.533
I am truly that.

45:35.533 --> 45:37.168
Yes, whore.

45:37.168 --> 45:38.569
[RuPaul] Oh, those mountains
are definitely high enough.

45:38.569 --> 45:39.704
[all laugh]

45:39.704 --> 45:41.872
[Michelle]
Turquoise for the boys.

45:41.872 --> 45:43.207
[all laugh]

45:43.207 --> 45:46.344
[RuPaul] Call her Miss Ross.

45:46.344 --> 45:47.812
Plastique Tiara.

45:47.812 --> 45:49.714
Oh, I love a water feature.

45:49.714 --> 45:50.982
[Clea laughs]

45:50.982 --> 45:52.316
[Plastique]
I'm super excited for this.

45:52.316 --> 45:55.086
Sparkling bubbles
all over my body.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.521
I look like an eel
freshly out of water.

45:57.521 --> 45:58.623
Feeling gorgeous.

45:58.623 --> 45:59.824
[Ross] Icy what she did there.

45:59.824 --> 46:01.392
[RuPaul] Mm-hmm.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.861
[Michelle] Now where could she
be hiding her trident?

46:03.861 --> 46:04.895
[all laugh]

46:04.895 --> 46:06.697
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

46:06.697 --> 46:08.566
I've made some decisions.

46:10.034 --> 46:12.637
When I call your name,
please step forward.

46:13.804 --> 46:15.473
A'Keria C. Davenport.

46:17.174 --> 46:18.342
Plastique Tiara.

46:20.077 --> 46:21.846
Ladies, you are safe.

46:24.415 --> 46:26.417
You may leave the stage.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.518
Thank you.

46:30.521 --> 46:35.626
Ladies, you represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

46:39.563 --> 46:43.000
[RuPaul] Ladies, now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

46:43.000 --> 46:47.338
starting
with Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.306
I like this look.
It's a little Storm from X-Men.

46:49.306 --> 46:52.843
Vanjie, leotard and a cape
is what it is.

46:52.843 --> 46:55.479
At this point,
I don't know what else to do.

46:55.479 --> 46:59.483
It's just like
the same thing again.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.919
Is there
a lack of creativity here?

47:01.919 --> 47:03.354
[Ross] Or is there a look?

47:03.354 --> 47:05.122
Is there a brandable thing
she's got going on?

47:05.122 --> 47:07.692
Yes, and she did that
six times already.

47:07.692 --> 47:09.460
Now let's talk about
the Snatch Game.

47:09.460 --> 47:12.730
Now, listen, I've watched
so much Danielle Bregoli

47:12.730 --> 47:13.831
it's not even funny.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.800
You didn't embody her at all.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.035
You started out with
some weird Muppet voice.

47:18.035 --> 47:19.170
What's up, Dr. Phil?

47:19.170 --> 47:20.938
And then it just was you.

47:20.938 --> 47:22.206
Cash me outside, how 'bout that?

47:22.206 --> 47:24.608
The Meryl Streep of drag
you are not.

47:24.608 --> 47:26.010
Who dat?

47:26.010 --> 47:29.046
-Oh, from Devil Wears Prada?
-Ding-dong.

47:29.046 --> 47:30.414
[Clea] I don't know who

47:30.414 --> 47:33.117
the cash me outside girl
is really,

47:33.117 --> 47:35.019
but you really made me laugh.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.387
Thank you.

47:36.387 --> 47:38.322
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

47:38.322 --> 47:39.357
Your makeup
looks lovely tonight.

47:39.357 --> 47:40.958
Thank you.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.093
It's blended out.

47:42.093 --> 47:42.993
Your eyebrows
are in a better place.

47:42.993 --> 47:43.928
They're thicker.

47:43.928 --> 47:45.162
You have that campy look,

47:45.162 --> 47:47.398
and it separates you
from the other girls.

47:47.398 --> 47:49.633
What I noticed watching
the Snatch Game

47:49.633 --> 47:52.269
is that you made Ru laugh a lot.

47:52.269 --> 47:54.371
And then when you switched
to Jo Anne Worley,

47:54.371 --> 47:58.876
you chose an obscure person
who Ru happens to love.

47:58.876 --> 48:01.112
So it was a wise choice.

48:01.112 --> 48:03.114
And you got some
of the ♪ whoos ♪ in there.

48:03.114 --> 48:04.215
[laughs]

48:04.215 --> 48:05.950
Yeah, I loved
your bit with the cards.

48:05.950 --> 48:07.685
It was a lot of fun
to watch you.

48:07.685 --> 48:11.689
When Ru threw a ball your way,
you hit back every time.

48:11.689 --> 48:13.023
That's how you win Snatch Game.

48:14.191 --> 48:15.960
Up next, Shuga Cain,

48:15.960 --> 48:20.164
in one of my favorite dresses
to ever walk down this runway.

48:20.164 --> 48:21.365
Thank you.

48:21.365 --> 48:23.834
That eggplant color
is just gorgeous on you.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.469
Aah!

48:25.469 --> 48:27.371
I mean, I'm allergic
to eggplant, but I don't care.

48:27.371 --> 48:29.006
I'll get an extra EpiPen,

48:29.006 --> 48:31.008
because I can't get enough
of this dress.

48:31.008 --> 48:33.911
Your Snatch Game was
really, really fun to watch.

48:33.911 --> 48:38.249
You did look exactly like her,
you sounded exactly like her.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.384
[Michelle]
I thought you did a great job.

48:40.384 --> 48:41.652
But you could have
taken it further.

48:41.652 --> 48:43.888
But I thought
every time you spoke...

48:43.888 --> 48:45.289
I said Mazola.

48:45.289 --> 48:47.758
[Ross] It was funny,
it was in Charo's voice,

48:47.758 --> 48:49.260
and you looked just like her.

48:49.260 --> 48:51.796
[RuPaul] Up next,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

48:51.796 --> 48:55.299
Wowa-wowa-wowa-wowa.

48:55.299 --> 48:59.837
That runway storyline,
we were gagging.

48:59.837 --> 49:03.841
You gave us Nomi Malone 2019.

49:03.841 --> 49:05.442
Yes!
[all laugh]

49:05.442 --> 49:06.710
[Tony] It's going
to probably go down

49:06.710 --> 49:08.612
in like RuPaul history
of like great reveals.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.014
Thank God for that,

49:10.014 --> 49:12.082
because we're gonna
talk about your Snatch Game.

49:12.082 --> 49:14.318
I got the backwards suit,

49:14.318 --> 49:16.153
and I think
that's where it ended.

49:16.153 --> 49:18.589
I just got like a confused
realtor maybe from Toronto.

49:18.589 --> 49:19.824
What happened?

49:19.824 --> 49:24.428
I panicked,
and, yeah, I fucked up.

49:24.428 --> 49:26.397
Canada called,
and they're pissed.

49:26.397 --> 49:29.099
[laughs]

49:29.099 --> 49:32.703
There is so much fun to be had
with Celine Dion.

49:32.703 --> 49:34.038
You know, she's so intense
about everything.

49:34.038 --> 49:35.105
You know, she--

49:35.105 --> 49:36.173
You just made her Italian.

49:36.173 --> 49:38.542
Shut up.
[all laugh]

49:38.542 --> 49:41.645
The accent wasn't there,
the jokes weren't there.

49:41.645 --> 49:45.783
It was a big letdown,
and I'm worried about you.

49:47.685 --> 49:50.020
All right, up next, Yvie Oddly.

49:50.020 --> 49:52.656
I think you look gorgeous.
Like this is such a cool outfit.

49:52.656 --> 49:55.025
And I wish that
I could pull anything,

49:55.025 --> 49:56.594
even one thing
that you're wearing off,

49:56.594 --> 49:57.895
but I'm too square.

49:57.895 --> 49:59.997
That jumpsuit is fantastic.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.466
So Ziggy Stardust.

50:02.466 --> 50:04.969
I love this hair on you,

50:04.969 --> 50:06.904
but that's giving me
like sixties girl group.

50:06.904 --> 50:10.507
But what I'm getting below
is like seventies glam rock.

50:10.507 --> 50:12.176
The head up and the head down

50:12.176 --> 50:13.878
are giving me
two different looks.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.346
Let's talk about Snatch Game.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.748
Whoopi's a good choice,
because we all know Whoopi,

50:17.748 --> 50:19.550
and there's a lot there.

50:19.550 --> 50:21.452
And you brought none of that.

50:21.452 --> 50:24.255
You could have even said,
"Ru, you in danger, girl."

50:24.255 --> 50:26.023
You could have had some clay

50:26.023 --> 50:27.491
and make believe
you were doing the pottery.

50:27.491 --> 50:30.761
Sister Act, Sister Act,
oh, my gosh.

50:30.761 --> 50:33.364
Even though
I had done my research,

50:33.364 --> 50:36.367
I got on that panel and I
just like forgot everything.

50:36.367 --> 50:39.370
I just think you overthought
a narrow part of her,

50:39.370 --> 50:41.906
and stuck too hard to that.

50:41.906 --> 50:43.874
That was a really big misfire.

50:43.874 --> 50:47.678
[RuPaul] All right.
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

50:47.678 --> 50:50.547
Tonight on the runway
you look beautiful.

50:50.547 --> 50:53.884
The moment you opened your mouth
yesterday, I was laughing.

50:53.884 --> 50:55.986
[Ross] You always
look like you're having fun,

50:55.986 --> 50:59.723
and that just makes us
have so much fun with you.

50:59.723 --> 51:03.394
Something that you have that
a lot of improv players have,

51:03.394 --> 51:04.795
where there's
a "yes and" quality,

51:04.795 --> 51:06.130
and it's super fun to watch.

51:06.130 --> 51:09.433
Technically a couple ha-ha-ha
in Snatch Game.

51:09.433 --> 51:10.434
You get it. The hair.

51:10.434 --> 51:12.836
That wig, girl. Whoo-fa.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.805
It was chewed up by dogs.

51:14.805 --> 51:18.709
It was dragged
down Main Street, USA.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.277
Girl.

51:20.277 --> 51:23.447
-The 22 inches refers to?
-Her hair.

51:23.447 --> 51:26.250
Okay. I was
a little nervous to ask.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.818
[all laugh]
But, uh...

51:27.818 --> 51:29.320
That would be very long.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.555
Well, I don't have a lot
of experience with those,

51:31.555 --> 51:32.790
so who knows?

51:32.790 --> 51:35.426
[all laugh]

51:35.426 --> 51:37.428
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

51:37.428 --> 51:39.930
While you untuck backstage,

51:39.930 --> 51:42.099
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.470
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

51:46.470 --> 51:49.006
I want to know
what you guys think.

51:49.006 --> 51:50.874
Vanjie Mateo.

51:50.874 --> 51:52.276
I like Vanjie.

51:52.276 --> 51:54.578
Every time she spoke,
I was thoroughly entertained.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.013
She made me laugh, too.

51:56.013 --> 51:58.682
Guys, Vanjie will make you laugh
just because she's Vanjie.

51:58.682 --> 52:02.086
But the Snatch Game,
she was Vanjie in a bad red wig.

52:02.086 --> 52:03.387
But I don't care.

52:03.387 --> 52:05.255
It's like you go
to a Julia Roberts movie,

52:05.255 --> 52:06.623
and you see Julia Roberts,

52:06.623 --> 52:08.726
and you're like, good,
'cause I love Julia Roberts.

52:08.726 --> 52:10.027
Vanjie's whole thing

52:10.027 --> 52:13.764
is that she's hilarious
and authentically Vanjie,

52:13.764 --> 52:15.466
and she's bringing that
every week.

52:15.466 --> 52:17.034
That was not what
the challenge is.

52:17.034 --> 52:18.736
I love the tension.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.504
One day we're just gonna
have passionate sex.

52:20.504 --> 52:22.506
Yes, you and me, Rossy.

52:22.506 --> 52:24.375
On a very special
RuPaul's Drag Race.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.543
[all laugh]

52:26.543 --> 52:28.345
Nina West.

52:28.345 --> 52:29.713
Nina just really exudes joy.

52:29.713 --> 52:31.181
She's got the opposite

52:31.181 --> 52:33.817
of like the person
who has a resting bitch face.

52:33.817 --> 52:35.486
Don't look at me,
because you don't have that.

52:35.486 --> 52:36.553
[all laugh]

52:36.553 --> 52:38.122
You're full of joy,
and I know that.

52:38.122 --> 52:39.556
[all laugh]

52:39.556 --> 52:43.660
Nina West in the Snatch Game
was one of my tops.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.063
She had a fully realized
character,

52:46.063 --> 52:47.898
and not only one, but two.

52:47.898 --> 52:52.169
Tonight was a very strong night
for Nina West.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.771
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

52:53.771 --> 52:54.972
Shuga Cain
with that gorgeous dress.

52:54.972 --> 52:57.508
That "merlot she better don't"
gown.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.376
-Mm-hmm.
-Absolutely gorgeous.

52:59.376 --> 53:03.414
In terms of Snatch Game,
how she sounded was spot-on.

53:03.414 --> 53:05.983
Shuga like loves Charo,
and you could feel that.

53:05.983 --> 53:08.552
[Michelle]
She, too, came prepared.

53:08.552 --> 53:10.287
But the difference between her
and Nina for me

53:10.287 --> 53:12.022
was she didn't take it
very far.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.491
You know, I would have loved
to seen her push it further.

53:14.491 --> 53:16.627
But Shuga has done very well,

53:16.627 --> 53:19.463
and she's emerging
in this competition.

53:19.463 --> 53:21.365
So it's a good, good night
for her.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.133
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

53:23.133 --> 53:25.302
We're gonna talk
about everything

53:25.302 --> 53:27.104
that's all
coming back to me now.

53:27.104 --> 53:28.939
[laughs]

53:28.939 --> 53:31.341
There was no Celine in that.

53:31.341 --> 53:33.210
It was all wrong.

53:33.210 --> 53:36.280
But then the runway happened.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.948
[RuPaul] Oh, goodness.

53:37.948 --> 53:39.349
Bitch!

53:39.349 --> 53:41.452
[RuPaul] That is one
for the history books.

53:41.452 --> 53:43.454
-Amen.
-It was so exciting.

53:43.454 --> 53:44.721
But here's the question.

53:44.721 --> 53:47.291
With her Snatch Game
being so terrible,

53:47.291 --> 53:49.326
is this enough to save her

53:49.326 --> 53:51.128
from having to lip sync for
her life and maybe going home?

53:51.128 --> 53:52.296
True.

53:52.296 --> 53:53.664
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

53:53.664 --> 53:55.132
Yvie's one of my favorites

53:55.132 --> 53:57.267
because she's
so specifically her.

53:57.267 --> 53:58.802
Every week, it's fun to see

53:58.802 --> 54:02.206
how she funnels the challenge
through her Yvie filter.

54:02.206 --> 54:05.175
And usually
it works out okay for her.

54:05.175 --> 54:07.811
This time,
she got in her own way.

54:07.811 --> 54:10.080
[Clea] There's
something about her

54:10.080 --> 54:11.949
that I find very interesting,
and she seems like

54:11.949 --> 54:13.684
she has a very specific
point of view.

54:13.684 --> 54:18.655
I don't know that that fully
came out in the Snatch Game.

54:18.655 --> 54:21.425
She missed almost
the entire essence of Whoopi.

54:21.425 --> 54:24.695
And after seeing
kind of the life and joy

54:24.695 --> 54:27.731
of kind of Nina and Silky,
it was like, whoo.

54:27.731 --> 54:30.734
Worst week yet for Yvie.

54:30.734 --> 54:34.238
[RuPaul] The Reverend
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

54:34.238 --> 54:36.440
You want to talk about
star quality, that kid's got it.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.876
-Mm-hmm.
-And Silky's star quality

54:38.876 --> 54:41.311
worked for her
in the Snatch Game as well.

54:41.311 --> 54:43.714
And it was so effortless.
She was really living in it.

54:43.714 --> 54:45.849
Every time Snatch Game
comes around,

54:45.849 --> 54:47.818
I look forward
to having that patter

54:47.818 --> 54:50.320
and sort of volleying
with someone,

54:50.320 --> 54:53.790
and I was able to do that
with our Silky Ganache.

54:53.790 --> 54:55.526
-Yes, honey.
-Silence.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.694
I've made my decision.

54:57.694 --> 55:01.365
Bring back my girls!

55:01.365 --> 55:02.466
[all laugh]

55:02.466 --> 55:04.434
Ru, I want to hear that again.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.270
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

55:06.270 --> 55:08.238
I've made some decisions.

55:11.074 --> 55:12.042
Nina West.

55:13.944 --> 55:15.179
You're safe.

55:15.179 --> 55:16.246
Thank you.

55:16.246 --> 55:18.148
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

55:19.349 --> 55:20.851
You're safe.

55:24.988 --> 55:28.125
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

55:28.125 --> 55:33.096
Tonight,
Ts stands for Top Snatch.

55:34.565 --> 55:37.167
Con-drag-ulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.369

55:39.369 --> 55:43.807
You've won a $5.000
gift certificate from Vacaya,

55:43.807 --> 55:49.446
which you could use for
a fabulous LGBT+ vacation.

55:49.446 --> 55:52.382
Book yours at myvacaya.com.

55:52.382 --> 55:53.584
Thank you.

55:53.584 --> 55:54.785
You may join the other girls.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.587
Thank you.
God bless you.

55:56.587 --> 56:00.657
I am stepping over
Miss Yvie Oddly with my $5.000.

56:00.657 --> 56:04.094
How you doing?

56:04.094 --> 56:06.897
Brooke Lynn Hytes,
on the runway,

56:06.897 --> 56:09.866
you are queen of the world.

56:09.866 --> 56:13.971
But your Celine Dion
was a Titanic disaster.

56:15.505 --> 56:17.774
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

56:20.611 --> 56:25.549
Yvie Oddly, after that
Whoopi Goldberg impersonation,

56:25.549 --> 56:27.251
you in danger, girl.

56:29.286 --> 56:35.125
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, your
bad baby was a problem, child.

56:37.094 --> 56:38.829
Vanjie...

56:40.897 --> 56:42.099
You're safe.

56:47.938 --> 56:49.373
[RuPaul] Yvie,
I'm sorry, my dear,

56:49.373 --> 56:51.174
but you are up for elimination.

56:52.643 --> 56:56.613
The bitch who called me
talentless is in the bottom.

56:56.613 --> 56:58.382
[laughs]

56:58.382 --> 57:00.384
The bottom
looks nice on you, bitch.

57:00.384 --> 57:04.221
Two queens stand before me.

57:04.221 --> 57:08.025
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:08.025 --> 57:12.729
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:14.564 --> 57:16.600
The time has come...
[thunder]

57:16.600 --> 57:18.869
for you to lip sync...

57:24.374 --> 57:25.542

57:25.542 --> 57:27.144
I'm not going
to just die off gently.

57:28.178 --> 57:30.314

57:30.314 --> 57:31.782
