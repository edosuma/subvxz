LAINEY:
Back in the '90s, sports
mascots were all the rage.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.674
Fans went nuts for
the sausage races in Milwaukee

00:06.707 --> 00:08.909
and the legendary
Phillie Phanatic.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.811
But the traditional mascot
of William Penn

00:10.844 --> 00:12.613
didn't quite capture
that same fire.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.082
Ow!

00:14.115 --> 00:15.283
(LAUGHTER)

00:15.316 --> 00:16.850
MELLOR:
All right, enough!

00:16.884 --> 00:19.187
There's nothing funny about
a pass that far off target.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.622
The Quaker's lame!
I quit!

00:21.655 --> 00:23.257
Quaker, wait!

00:23.291 --> 00:25.426
You can't quit, Quaker.
We have a game tonight.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.627
We need
your Quaker energy.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.797
My name is Jessica,
and I don't care!
I'm done!

00:29.830 --> 00:30.998
I get it, okay?

00:31.031 --> 00:33.934
A goofy-headed pacifist
with an odd toothy smile

00:33.967 --> 00:36.970
doesn't exactly inspire a team
to crush the enemy,

00:37.004 --> 00:39.640
but he's been our mascot
for over 100 years.

00:39.673 --> 00:41.442
(SIGHS)

00:41.475 --> 00:44.178
**

00:44.212 --> 00:45.379
What if
I could help you?

00:45.413 --> 00:48.316
What if the Quaker
finally had...

00:48.349 --> 00:49.517
Power?

00:49.550 --> 00:50.884
I think
I'd like it a lot.

00:50.918 --> 00:52.786
**

00:52.820 --> 00:54.054
What the hell is this?

00:54.088 --> 00:55.789
You gave the Quaker
a weapon?

00:55.823 --> 00:57.525
I gave the Quaker
confidence.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.859
Rick, this is not
the kind of image

00:58.892 --> 01:00.628
we want associated
with our school.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.563
You know, this is why
I think we need

01:02.596 --> 01:03.997
to come up
with a new mascot.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.866
No way!
Coach, it's the '90s.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.169
Schools, colleges,
even pro sport teams

01:08.202 --> 01:12.005
are changing their mascots
to become more kind
and inclusive.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.375
But that is the opposite
of what a mascot should be!

01:14.408 --> 01:18.346
It needs to invoke fear
and aggressive behavior!

01:18.379 --> 01:20.181
Then I will personally
oversee the creation

01:20.214 --> 01:22.250
of this new mascot
all by myself.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.585
Whoa, wait.
Sports is my department.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.086
Coaching sports
is your department.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.256
Everything else
in this school,
that's all me.

01:28.289 --> 01:32.393
How about we compromise
by giving the Quaker
a T-shirt cannon?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.862
I know a great cannon guy.
He spots me at the gym.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.431
No cannon,
no creepy Quaker.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.268
And also, return this
to the harvest display.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.402
Thanks, pal.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.705
Oh, damn!
That's real!

01:44.738 --> 01:47.708
* One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here

01:47.741 --> 01:50.678
* Live your life
and finally be free

01:50.711 --> 01:53.614
* Go where you wanna go,
do what you wanna do

01:53.647 --> 01:57.251
* Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" *

01:57.285 --> 01:59.553
LAINEY: It was April 10th,
1990-something,

01:59.587 --> 02:01.021
and the final bell
had just rung.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.123
The end of work, one of
the highlights of my day.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.792
Hey, where you headed?
Home.

02:04.825 --> 02:05.893
I have
standing appointments

02:05.926 --> 02:08.028
with my girlfriends
Ricki Lake and Sally Jessy.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.397
Oh, come on.
Stick around.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.464
This is prime time

02:10.498 --> 02:12.333
to make meaningful connection
with the students.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.567
You realize
those connections

02:13.601 --> 02:15.603
are only meaningful
for you, right?

02:15.636 --> 02:16.937
Hey, CB.
You got a sec?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.373
Uh, watch and learn.
Of course, Aaron,
What's up, dude?

02:19.407 --> 02:21.409
I heard the school
used to have a radio station.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.611
I was thinking it'd be cool
to start it back up again.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.078
Maybe you could be
the club advisor.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.547
Consider yourself advised.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.416
Yes!
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.318
Wow. A week ago,
I encouraged Aaron

02:30.351 --> 02:32.119
to get more involved,
and boom.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.255
The kid's a Slater-head.
That's why he wants
to do radio.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.123
Like A.C. Slater
from Saved by the Bell?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.592
What?
Are you not down
with the Bell? Sad.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.993
I'm talking about
Christian Slater.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.762
Aaron literally
had him on his shirt.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.564
The kid clearly watched
Pump Up the Volume

02:43.597 --> 02:44.932
and now wants
a piece of the cool.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.133
Why only a piece
when he can have

02:46.166 --> 02:47.201
the whole cool package
right here?

02:47.701 --> 02:48.702
Come with me.

02:50.271 --> 02:53.474
Let's see. Who do we have
out there tonight, huh?

02:53.507 --> 02:56.677
The, uh, usual band
of teenage malcontents?

02:56.710 --> 02:59.513
See? Christian Slater plays
a badass radio DJ

02:59.547 --> 03:01.482
who turns his whole school
upside down.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.784
Now you see why Aaron Rubin
wants to be this guy.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.086
I want to be this guy.
He's such a badass.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.322
Agree on all points.
This movie's awesome.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.423
I've seen it like 60 times,

03:09.457 --> 03:10.858
and I remember
at least five of them.

03:10.891 --> 03:11.959
We're gonna
give these kids

03:11.992 --> 03:13.794
the best student
radio station ever!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.128
Right on.
Let's do this.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.297
He means "we"
as in "me," dude.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.931
Pretty sure "he" meant "we"
as in "three."

03:17.965 --> 03:19.099
I meant "we"
as in "me and she."

03:19.132 --> 03:20.301
Oh, come on!

03:20.334 --> 03:22.202
That radio equipment
is here 'cause of me.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.472
Back when
I roamed these halls,
I had a radio show

03:24.505 --> 03:25.639
the whole school
was obsessed with.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.707
Tell him, Lainey.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.975
I have no memory of this.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.042
Rush Hour?

03:29.076 --> 03:31.044
30 minutes
of nonstop Rush songs!

03:31.078 --> 03:32.613
Why not 60 minutes?

03:32.646 --> 03:35.115
I mean, it would
make more sense
with Rush Hour.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.684
Wow.
Never thought of that.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.851
I think
we're good here, pal.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.553
If you need me,
you know where to find me.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.956
LAINEY:  So, just like that,
the school radio station
was brought back to life.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.525
Welcome to
our radio show.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.027
Today's topic...
Uh, fish sticks.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.161
Becky,
what did you think?

03:48.195 --> 03:49.897
They were all right.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.300
Yeah, uh,
they were all right.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.834
Oh, man.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.370
This is so
Pump Up the Volume,
you know?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.339
Yeah, it's just like
the moment after the credits,

03:58.372 --> 03:59.473
when the screen
was black.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.275
I know.
This isn't Slater at all.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.210
LAINEY: Guys, come on.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.179
This is an opportunity
to express how you
really feel.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.881
Don't hold back.
You're 15.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.650
Life sucks
'cause you're oily
and have braces.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.718
You should be angry.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.185
I am angry!

04:12.219 --> 04:14.755
Those fish sticks
were not all right.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.156
Yeah, I prefer
the nuggets.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.491
Okay. Good start.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.827
Anything non-nugget-
or fish-stick-related
that pisses you off?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.829
Well, I have three tests
on Friday,

04:21.862 --> 04:23.364
and that, like, sucks.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.732
Don't tell me.
Tell them.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.534
(SWITCH CLICKS)

04:26.567 --> 04:28.402
I have three tests
on Friday,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.103
and that, like, sucks.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.172
No, wait.
It's bull poop.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.240
This is bull crap!

04:33.273 --> 04:34.608
Yeah!
Poop.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.710
LAINEY: As I was getting
the kids fired up,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.712
Glascott was psyched
to show his choice

04:38.746 --> 04:40.013
for his new symbol
of the school.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.515
Okay,
this better be good.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.851
I left a cold protein shake
on my desk.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.919
GLASCOTT: This will be
well worth your time.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.289
I present to you
the new and improved mascot
of William Penn,

04:49.323 --> 04:51.892
powerful
and yet non-offensive.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.927
Lifting our school
to new heights,

04:53.961 --> 04:55.262
I give you...

04:55.295 --> 04:56.464
The Wind!

04:59.467 --> 05:00.768
You got to be
kidding me.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.804
Now blow
a gust of wind.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.809
JESSICA: Did I do it right?
Is it out?

05:08.842 --> 05:11.712
Oh, yeah. And at pep rallies,
she'll be on roller skates!

05:11.745 --> 05:13.581
You really want to die
on this hill, John?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.148
The principal
has made up his mind.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.249
End of discussion.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.652
Look, I got a way
we can fix all this.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.721
You make me
Athletics Principal,

05:20.754 --> 05:23.056
and I'll make sure
we hold on to our old mascot.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.458
Athletics Principal?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.959
(CHUCKLES)
That's your idea?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.928
Yeah. You know,
I'd be in charge

05:27.961 --> 05:29.663
of everything under
the athletics umbrella,

05:29.697 --> 05:31.565
like sports, and, uh,

05:31.599 --> 05:34.835
pep rallies, mascotting,
and jock strap-ery.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.637
And you'd be in charge
of everything else.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.172
You can't section off my job
into a bunch of principals.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.108
What's next?
Science Principal?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.510
Art Principal?

05:42.543 --> 05:44.412
Rick, I'm the one and only
principal around here,

05:44.445 --> 05:46.346

with the Wind.

We have a problem,
as, apparently,

05:52.686 --> 05:56.156
your deejays like
to do daily critiques
of my wardrobe.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.460
Today they said
my outfit looked
like a homeless cowgirl.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.462
Liz, you can't take it
personally.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.196
Yeah, I think
it's a cute...vest.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.933
I'll have you know that
this is a sleeveless poncho

06:05.966 --> 06:09.770
that was hand-stitched
by a Navajo businesswoman
just outside of Taos.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.072
I mean, look at
this intricate handcrafting...

06:14.642 --> 06:17.678
It has served its purpose
and will return to the earth
from whence it came.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.146
Liz, I'm sorry
about the kids,

06:19.179 --> 06:20.681
but they're just
expressing themselves.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.117
Well, I don't appreciate
being publicly critiqued
by my students.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.519
And the other teachers
agree.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.721
But they're learning to rebel
and speak their minds.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.523
Yeah, Liz, let's stop
being so insecure

06:29.557 --> 06:31.124
and encourage
their voices for once.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.861
That's right.
Instead of shutting them down,
let's hear more.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.730
AARON:  Sometimes,
it feels like the teachers
just aren't on our side.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.566
BECKY: Totally.
Except for Lainey and CB.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.668
They're still
looking out for us.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.703
AARON: Which is amazing,
'cause lately it seems
that they spend

06:42.736 --> 06:44.171
most of their time
looking at each other.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.874
BECKY: So true. It's like,
get a room already!

06:46.907 --> 06:49.376
Well, this has taken
an unexpected turn.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.512
BECKY: This next song
is dedicated to them.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.747
This is Boyz II Men,
I'll Make Love to...

Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.

That's funny
to me, too.
Yeah. Super funny.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.757
I'll let you two
have the room.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.425
Okay.
You don't
have to do that.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.528
CB: No. All right,
take care.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.062
We gotta
shut those punks down.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.370

the most idiotic mascot

07:17.404 --> 07:18.739
to represent
our school,

07:18.772 --> 07:20.941
and now I have the board
breathing down my neck,

07:20.974 --> 07:22.510
so you fix this!

07:22.543 --> 07:23.611
Just give it a chance.

Trust me,
I'm making the right call.

Mascots aren't
your call anymore.

off your plate,

to Mellor.

Oh, my God.
He got to you.

I-I came up with this
on my own.

You tell him
I'm the Athletics Principal?

07:40.393 --> 07:42.930
Damn it, Rick.
I told you to hide
by the vending machines.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.132
I can't believe you're gonna
listen to his insane idea.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.235
There is no such thing
as Athletics Principal.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.070
And how would
that work, anyhow?

07:50.103 --> 07:53.140
Not my job
to figure out the details.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.442
It's my job to make
the sweeping change

07:55.475 --> 07:58.311
and to let you two
take it from there.
Good luck.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.214
We're gonna crush this thing
together, huh?

08:01.248 --> 08:02.783
I don't wanna
crush this together.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.753
Well, geez, I'm just trying
to get off on the right foot
with my fellow principal.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.455
You just stick to athletics.
I do everything else.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.591
Ah, do your thing.
You won't even know I'm here.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.292
Ha!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.727
All right, everyone,
let's begin.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.295
Uh, just a few
announcements today...

08:15.328 --> 08:17.330
Yes!
Let's get started.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.900
It's meeting time,
which for us is game time.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.569
We can do this, team!

08:21.602 --> 08:23.303
Rick,
what are you doing?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.072
I'm co-leading
the meeting.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.340
Everyone, I have been
formally promoted

08:27.374 --> 08:30.110
to this school's
new Athletics Principal.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.780
Sure. Well, this is
a staff meeting,
and I'm running it.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.947
The non-athletics part.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.849
All right,
let's just push through.
All right.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.919
Item one, faculty parking lot.
Item one, faculty party logs.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.287
GLASCOTT: We'll be
repaving the faculty...

08:40.320 --> 08:41.488
We'll be repasting
the faculty...

08:41.521 --> 08:43.323
...parking lot this Tuesday...
...paper long this Tuesday...

08:43.356 --> 08:44.457
...so teachers
will be directed...

08:44.491 --> 08:45.659
...so teachers'll
be directing...

08:45.693 --> 08:46.960
...to park in the
visitors' lot.
...the visitor paper logs.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.195
Make sure that you get
your green passes...

08:48.228 --> 08:49.496
Maple sugar you pick up
your great packets.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.031
...or your car
will be ticketed.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.232
Otherwise,
you will be tickled.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.735
And yes, the overflow...
And yes,
of course, overlord...

08:54.768 --> 08:57.304
...will be sent to
the students' parking lot...
...partying will be in the...

08:57.337 --> 08:59.239
...right, in the Studebaker.
So try to get here early.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.843
You know, Rick, why don't
I do my announcements
and then you do yours?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.144
You got it,
Co-Prince.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
(GROANS)

09:06.246 --> 09:07.715
There's...

09:07.748 --> 09:09.950
Nothing written
on these.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.552
Mmm.
Meeting adjourned!

09:12.586 --> 09:15.122
**

09:15.155 --> 09:16.757
LAINEY:  Thanks
to the Radio Club,

09:16.790 --> 09:20.527
the whole school
was gossiping about CB and me.
It was time to rein them in.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.397
Gotta say,
been a great first week
for the radio station.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.333
Yes!
LAINEY: You guys are
telling it like it is

09:26.366 --> 09:27.400
and making a difference.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.636
We could not be
more proud.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.570
But others disagree.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.505
Yeah, teachers are pissed.
They want to shut you down.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.674
What?

09:33.707 --> 09:36.309
But, as the cool ones
who started
this whole thing,

09:36.343 --> 09:38.912
we've come up with a solution
that works for everyone.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.848
Lainey?

09:40.881 --> 09:43.350
"Pre-Approved Ways
To Rebel"?

09:43.383 --> 09:46.920
This list is so rad,
only the baddest
boys and girls

09:46.954 --> 09:49.757
dare touch
controversial stuff like this.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.324
Yeah, like
classroom temperature.

09:51.358 --> 09:52.826
Taco Tuesday.
Pencil sharpeners.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.261
Rain.
Rain?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.996
Rain.
Ew. I hate rain.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.164
So controversial.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.231
This is so lame.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.733
Yesterday
we were talking about

09:59.767 --> 10:01.835
things that really
meant something to us.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.604
Yeah, if we can't talk
about what we want,
what's the point?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.039
I'd rather
not do it at all.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.341
Ooh, you know what?
This is good.
I like your defiance.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.910
Me too.
Let's shut it down.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.378
Wait. Wait, what?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.946
You're telling them
if you can't run your station

10:12.980 --> 10:14.715
the way you want,
then you won't do it at all.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.216
That is badass.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.451
Your silence will be
louder than your words.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.552
That's not what I said.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.221
Shhah! Silence.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.892
CB and I had shut down
the radio station

10:24.925 --> 10:26.359
and the gossip about us
for good.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.528
Or so we had thought.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.463
Hey.
What's going on?

10:30.497 --> 10:31.799
The radio station,
it's back!

10:34.467 --> 10:36.970
(HIGH-PITCHED)
You're listening to
the Mad Mouth of William Penn,

10:37.004 --> 10:40.240
the voice of the voiceless
and the scourge
of our oppressors!

10:41.742 --> 10:43.043
The transmitter's gone.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.812
Yeah, that means
it's real pirate radio.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.447
(OVER SPEAKERS) Don't worry,
kiddies. No one will ever
shut me down.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.717
Not even the teacher
on the DL...

10:49.750 --> 10:50.918
Mr. and Mrs. Traitor!

10:50.951 --> 10:52.152
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

10:52.185 --> 10:53.653
Maybe he's talking
about someone else?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.122
CB and Lainey,
just to be clear.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.157
Nope.
We have to stop
being seen together.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.592
**

10:59.626 --> 11:00.928
You stay.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.330
LAINEY: Our plan to silence
the kids had backfired,

11:03.363 --> 11:06.099
while the power struggle
between John and Rick
was worse than ever.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.334
You know,
come to think of it,

11:07.367 --> 11:09.236
make it
an even 100 kickballs.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.537
What the hell?
Hello?

11:11.438 --> 11:12.740
They hung up.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.643
Okay, you need to stop
this whole
Athletics Principal nonsense.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.079
John, if this partnership
is gonna work...

11:19.112 --> 11:20.347
This is not
a partnership!

11:20.380 --> 11:22.182
I'm the principal
of this school.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.985
My God, does it bother you
that much that I'm in charge?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.754
No! Maybe.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.956
Only when you do dumb stuff,
which is a lot!

11:28.989 --> 11:31.658
There it is.
You want to be
in charge.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.960
That's what
this is all about.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.527
No!
Please.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.496
Everyone knows
you wanted this job,

11:36.529 --> 11:38.331
and you got angry
and disappointed

11:38.365 --> 11:39.933
and threw a fit
when you didn't get it.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.268
I did not!

11:41.301 --> 11:42.369
I was there.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.537
Ball said to me,
"You got the job,"

11:44.571 --> 11:47.040
and then you screamed,
"I'm angry and disappointed!"

11:47.074 --> 11:48.675
You want
to see me fail.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.843
But I won't.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.078
The Wind stays!

11:52.645 --> 11:53.781
So does the Quaker.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.183
You want to go to the mat
on this? 'Cause I will, pal.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.651
So will I.
We're wrestling
for real, right?

11:58.685 --> 11:59.719
No! Get out!

11:59.753 --> 12:00.988
I'm leaving.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.722
**

12:02.756 --> 12:03.857
You all know
why you're here.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.558
Someone in this room
is Mad Mouth.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.327
Anybody want to step up
and admit it?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.495
It's not anyone here.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.798
But whoever it is,
they speak for all of us.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.200
Yeah, I wouldn't turn them in
if I knew who it was.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.501
I have total respect
for that.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.803
Same. Word.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.137
But now the trial begins.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.040
Each of you will read
from one of Mad Mouth's
hate-filled screeds

12:20.073 --> 12:22.375
so we can figure out
who's been talking about us.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.643
Well... Not us.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.713
And yes, us, but...
The whole school in general.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.848
This isn't
gonna help you.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.349
Mad Mouth
disguises his voice.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.750
(SCOFFS)
I'm a trained musician.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.152
I have an ear
for these things.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.553
Mad Mouth
will be exposed.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.089
"The administration
is run by cowards and pigs

12:36.123 --> 12:37.590
"who only care
about money."

12:37.624 --> 12:39.893
"CB and Lainey
are so annoying.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.096
"Clearly,
they're hot for each other.
Just get busy already!"

12:43.130 --> 12:44.898
Um, CB,
which screed is this?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.099
(WHISPERING)
I don't know.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.935
I had
Ms. Jensen's typing class
transcribe it for me.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.369
"The bickering,
the teasing,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.171
"the long doe-eyed stares.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.739
"And that's just CB."

12:52.772 --> 12:54.107
I really should've
checked this first.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.275
"The bump-and-grind."

12:55.308 --> 12:56.376
"Get your freak on."

12:56.409 --> 12:57.444
"Knockin' boots."

12:57.477 --> 12:58.711
"Human pretzel,
double-dipped."

12:58.745 --> 13:01.014
Oh, come on! Doesn't this guy
talk about anything else?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.582
Whoever it is,
just admit it.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.352
It's not us.
Listen, he's on right now.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.888
MAD MOUTH:
As I speak, the lovebirds
are looking for me,

13:07.921 --> 13:09.389
trying to shut me down.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.624
Oh, and we will.
But they won't.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.126
You can't hide
from us forever.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.627
Because I can hide forever!

13:14.661 --> 13:15.896
Damn. He's annoying,
but good.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.130
Can we go now?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.365
Oh. Sure.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.200
Sorry to falsely
accuse you.
Yeah.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.434
Don't tell your parents
about this.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.536
Have a great day.
It was our fault.

13:23.570 --> 13:24.838
Tommy, tie your shoe.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.374
This is a nightmare.
We'll never figure out
who Mad Mouth is.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.943
Next up, some tunes from
the world's greatest band...

13:29.977 --> 13:31.078
Rush!

13:31.111 --> 13:32.779
Um, or any band.
Doesn't have to be Rush.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.081
But they are the greatest.
Damn it!

13:34.114 --> 13:35.615
Son of a bitch.
Such a dummy.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.317
**

13:37.350 --> 13:39.119
Don't you worry,
loyal listeners.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.287
Are you kidding me
right now?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.990
Oh, no! It's The Man.
Atkins signing off.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.424
I mean... Mad Mouth.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.658
What the hell
are you doing?

13:45.692 --> 13:47.727
I told you
radio was my jam.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.796
I just
liked feeling alive again.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.498
By telling everyone
we have a thing going on?

13:51.531 --> 13:53.233
But you do
have a thing going on.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.567
But we don't
have a thing going on!

13:54.601 --> 13:56.103
Then why are you two
bantering all the time

13:56.136 --> 13:57.570
and busting
each other's balls?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.472
'Cause that's
what friends do!
Yeah.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.075
I mean, look at him,
with his dumb hair
and his dumb ties,

14:02.109 --> 14:04.177
and, I mean,
who wears pants like that?
Okay, well...

14:04.211 --> 14:05.412
Sometimes, there are
so many pleats,

14:05.445 --> 14:06.746
I don't even understand
how there can be so many.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.782
Point is, we need
to tell Glascott about this.

14:09.816 --> 14:10.850
But I'll be fired.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.019
Well, frankly,
you should be,

14:12.052 --> 14:13.286
for turning on us
the way you did.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.922
At least I didn't
turn on the kids!

14:14.955 --> 14:17.157
What?
We didn't turn on them.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.291
All we did
was shut them down

14:18.325 --> 14:20.427
when we didn't like
what they were saying.
Oh.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.496
Look, part of my job
is I get to be
a fly on the wall,

14:23.530 --> 14:24.965
and I hear their problems.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.134
They don't think anybody cares
what they have to say,

14:27.167 --> 14:28.835
and all you did
was prove it was true.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.470
Well, your job
isn't to speak for them.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.806
You know, I work
just as hard as you do.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.543
And, frankly, I actually
respect these kids.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.180
**

14:41.481 --> 14:43.183
Serious Johnny Atkins
makes me sad.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.853
LAINEY: Glascott
was determined
to prove Mellor wrong

14:46.886 --> 14:48.488
and premiere his new mascot.

14:48.521 --> 14:51.224
Unfortunately,
not everyone was on board.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.525
Jessica?

14:52.559 --> 14:53.826
The pep rally's
about to start.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.162
Why aren't you in the Wind?

14:55.195 --> 14:56.896
Um, because
it's ridiculous.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.665
I'm having
a whole political battle

14:58.698 --> 15:00.400
with the so-called
Athletics Principal,

15:00.433 --> 15:03.336
and you would be
doing me a solid
if you put this on.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.338
Not on my watch,
Quaker Girl.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.840
Your Athletics Principal
is here to save you.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.709
Now put this on
and get out there

15:09.742 --> 15:12.045
and show them how a Quaker
slays the enemy.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.981
No. Put on my costume

15:14.014 --> 15:15.848
and show them
how the Wind can lift
our school

15:15.882 --> 15:17.750
to new heights
of sportsmanship and unity!

15:17.784 --> 15:19.352
Quakers never
stop fighting!

15:19.386 --> 15:20.988
The Wind
never stops blowing!

15:21.021 --> 15:22.389
I'm not doing either!

15:24.557 --> 15:27.094
Hope you're happy, John.
Now we have no mascot at all.

15:27.860 --> 15:28.861
Or do we?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.098
No.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.432
As Athletics Principal,

15:32.465 --> 15:34.501
I demand
you don't go out in that!

15:34.534 --> 15:36.103
And as the real,
actual principal,

15:36.136 --> 15:37.770
who will do anything
for his school,

15:37.804 --> 15:40.273
I dare you to stop me.

15:40.307 --> 15:44.277
GLASCOTT: (ON PA)
Blowing in from the east,
powerful and strong,

15:44.311 --> 15:46.846
I give you William Penn's
new and improved mascot.

15:46.879 --> 15:50.183
Let's hear it for...
The Wind!

15:50.217 --> 15:51.784
LAINEY: And with that,
Glascott presented

15:51.818 --> 15:55.422
his new symbol of William Penn
to the students.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.589
They were confused.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.591
GLASCOTT: How come
they're not clapping?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.228
That's okay, John.
You just gotta
kick it up a notch...

16:01.261 --> 16:03.130
Show 'em what The Wind
can really do.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.764
**

16:04.797 --> 16:06.299
(LAUGHTER)
LAINEY: It wasn't going well.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.635
And it only got worse.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.936
GLASCOTT: Quaker?

16:09.969 --> 16:10.970
Coach Rick!

16:11.804 --> 16:12.939
STUDENTS: Ohh!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.107
No weapons!

16:14.141 --> 16:15.775
LAINEY: Turns out
the two principals

16:15.808 --> 16:17.544
were not going down
without a fight.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.978
(CHEERING)

16:19.012 --> 16:20.380
Literally.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.483
**

16:23.516 --> 16:25.618
LAINEY: It had been
a day since
the battle of the mascots,

16:25.652 --> 16:28.821
but the war over who
was the true principal
was still raging.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.357
Okay, moving on.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.893
The sports banquet will be
bigger and more delicious
than ever this year...

16:33.926 --> 16:35.228
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Rick.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.330
Did you call
a faculty meeting
without me?

16:37.364 --> 16:40.433
Did I call upon my authority
as Athletics Principal?

16:40.467 --> 16:41.501
Indeed I did.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.171
Well, all announcements
go through me,

16:44.204 --> 16:45.605
the Principal Principal,

16:45.638 --> 16:47.407
which means
I get to say them.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.142
Okay, guys, guys,
it really doesn't matter
who...

16:49.176 --> 16:50.743
All right, well, listen.
We will be holding
practices...

16:50.777 --> 16:52.145
Okay, uh, we will be
holding practices...

16:52.179 --> 16:53.246
...for boys soccer
from 8:00 to 10:00...

16:53.280 --> 16:54.414
...at the boys soccer
from 8:00 to 10:00...

16:54.447 --> 16:55.515
...which means
that girls softball...

16:55.548 --> 16:56.949
...which would mean
that the girls soccer...

16:56.983 --> 16:58.685
...is now going to take place
on the northwest...
...is not going to be...

16:58.718 --> 16:59.986
...baseball field.
...taking place on that
northwest baseball field.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.054
Gentlemen, please!

17:02.522 --> 17:03.956
What the (BLEEP)
was that?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.325
See? Liz agrees!

17:05.358 --> 17:07.494
There's only room for
one principal at this school,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.696
so you guys need to make up
your minds right now.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.299
Show of hands!
Hey! Focus up, okay?

17:12.332 --> 17:14.301
You two,
figure this out

17:14.334 --> 17:15.668
and leave us
the heck out of it!

17:18.338 --> 17:19.372
(SIGHS)

17:19.406 --> 17:20.507
Well, this one
may be on me.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.875
Of course it is.
You want my job.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.777
Yeah, I do.

17:24.811 --> 17:25.845
I did.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.648
At least...
I wanted to be asked,

17:28.681 --> 17:30.683
to be taken seriously
for once.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.353
Rick, I take you seriously.
I always have.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.821
Well, then,
why'd you go rogue

17:34.854 --> 17:36.723
and make up your own mascot
without me?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.991
'Cause I wanted
to be taken seriously.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.393
The truth is,

17:40.427 --> 17:43.696
if there's anyone
not respected in their job,
it's me.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.234
Wow.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.169
Guess we both wanted
the same thing.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.804
Only difference is,
I'm such a disappointment,

17:51.838 --> 17:54.040
part of my job
was given to you.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.675
(MATCHBOX TWENTY'S PUSH
PLAYS)

17:55.708 --> 17:57.410
John, you're the only one
who would get up

17:57.444 --> 18:00.347
in front of all those people
dressed as the stupid wind.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.515
Now, if that doesn't
make you the heart
and soul of this school,

18:02.549 --> 18:03.916
then I don't know
what does.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.553
I think it's time
for you to be

18:06.586 --> 18:08.255
the one and only principal
again.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.056
Thanks, man.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.793
LAINEY: Coach and Glascott
had ended their mascot feud
once and for all,

18:13.826 --> 18:17.364
but as for CB and I, we still
had some work to finish.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.898
Hey, Johnny.
What are you doing?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.600
What does it look
like I'm doing?

18:20.633 --> 18:21.801
I'm done here.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.636
When you guys rat me out and
they hear that I'm Mad Mouth,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.505
there's no way
they'll keep me
at this school.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.241
Johnny, we didn't tell anybody
that you're Mad Mouth.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.742
You didn't tell Ball
about me?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.178
Oh, we told Ball
about you.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.546
We told him you should be
in charge of the radio club.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.382
What?
Sure.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.683
We told him
if he did that,

18:36.716 --> 18:38.418
the kids wouldn't need
a Mad Mouth...

18:38.451 --> 18:40.453
Because they'd have
somebody guiding them
who really gets it.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.122
(BOX THUDS)

18:43.156 --> 18:44.391
Oh, man.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.726
I can't believe you guys
would do this for me.

18:46.759 --> 18:50.029
But just so you know,
I'm not giving up
my regular job.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.199
(LAUGHS)

18:52.232 --> 18:54.267
* I wanna push you around

18:54.301 --> 18:58.205
* Well, I will, well, I will

18:58.238 --> 19:00.607
You ready to knock 'em dead
out there, Jessica?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.141
All right,
let's do this.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.943
I can't tell you
how impressed I am

19:03.976 --> 19:06.213
that you're still willing
to go out there
in that costume

19:06.246 --> 19:07.280
for this school.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.149
Well, what can I say?
Anything for William Penn.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.619
But this is probably
the last time.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.821
LAINEY: Our school years
are often filled

19:14.854 --> 19:17.657
with the most real, emotional
experiences of our lives,

19:17.690 --> 19:19.292
for both students
and teachers.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.294
And in tough times,

19:21.328 --> 19:23.463
where it can feel like we're
working against each other,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.298
we need to open ourselves up

19:25.332 --> 19:28.301
and understand what
we're really going through.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.169
I've known
that ponytailed man
a long time.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.738
I've never seen him
so happy.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.307
Yeah. Well,
we make a great team.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.408
Not really.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.509
We actually
caused a ton of damage

19:36.543 --> 19:38.578
and had to have the school
custodian set us straight.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.614
Well, at least we stopped
the flirting talk about us
from being a thing.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.450
I mean,
not a thing between us.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.784
Just, a thing.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.320
Believe me,
I want nothing to do
with any of that stuff, so...

19:47.354 --> 19:49.322
Right. Me neither.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.957
The thing is, I...

19:50.990 --> 19:53.125
I'm kind of
hung up on someone,

19:53.159 --> 19:55.462
and I didn't realize how hard
it would be working here.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.796
You know.

19:56.829 --> 19:57.997
Just...

19:58.030 --> 19:59.466
A lot of memories.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.001
Well, if you need someone
to talk to, I'm here.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.102
As a friend.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.704
Thanks, CB.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.273
Yeah.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.376
**

20:09.409 --> 20:13.446
LAINEY: My memories
were of a boyfriend
I had back in the '80s.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.382
It was hard
to forget our time.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.786
* I wanna push you around

20:19.819 --> 20:22.389
* Well, I will, well, I will

20:22.422 --> 20:25.057
* I wanna push you down

20:25.091 --> 20:28.194
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
* Well, I will, well, I will

20:28.227 --> 20:32.031
* I wanna push you around

20:35.668 --> 20:37.904
Hi, I'm Sean Marquette,
and I'm sitting here

20:37.937 --> 20:40.840
with the real
Johnny Atkins.

20:40.873 --> 20:44.744
I want to ask about
your lifelong commitment
to the ponytail.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.845
(LAUGHS)

20:45.878 --> 20:47.814
I started growing it
in high school.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.416
Mom wasn't
real happy about it.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.583
If I pulled it
real tight

20:50.617 --> 20:52.352
and I looked her
straight in the face,

20:52.385 --> 20:53.520
it looked like
I had short hair.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.422
"Morning, Mom.
Don't look at my profile."

20:55.455 --> 20:57.089
That's exactly right.
(LAUGHING)
That's great.

20:57.123 --> 20:59.559
I hear you went dressed as
Johnny Atkins for Halloween.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.861
Yeah, I decided to dress up
as you dressed up as me.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.195
MARQUETTE: Turns out,
really easy outfit.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.565
You just need a Rush shirt
and some glasses like this.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.100
What was it like growing up in
a small town, like Jenkintown?

21:08.134 --> 21:10.403
It was great
because you knew everybody,

21:10.437 --> 21:12.439
and it was horrible
because everybody knew you.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.573
(LAUGHS)

21:13.606 --> 21:15.041
Like having
a town full of parents.

21:15.074 --> 21:18.010
Did you really play
the saxophone in high school?

21:18.044 --> 21:19.846
I played saxophone through
high school, through college.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.213
Did you get chicks
with the saxophone?

21:21.247 --> 21:23.049
No.
(LAUGHS)
