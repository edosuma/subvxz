00:01.914 --> 00:05.005
MAN: Tonight, look upon the evl

00:05.135 --> 00:07.137
that you did.

00:07.181 --> 00:10.967
ANNOUNCER: A Christmas Carol premieres December 19 at 7:30 on FX.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.536
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.579 --> 00:17.147
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.325
DENNIS:
My God, for the love of God,
there's two more of 'em.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.153
FRANK:
I mean, it's giving me
indigestion.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.720
-CHARLIE: Yeah, man.
-MAC: I'm tired
of looking at it.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.504
CHARLIE:
And where are they
even coming from, dude?

00:26.548 --> 00:28.202
It's that new salonthat opened up down the street.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.507
I thought it was
gonna be good for business,

00:29.551 --> 00:31.248
-but this is hard to look at.
-DEE: I don't even understand

00:31.292 --> 00:33.642
-why you guys give a shit.
-Why do we give a shit?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.296
-Yeah.
-These women have
mutilated themselves, Dee.

00:35.339 --> 00:36.732
It's an abomination.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.125
Once you go down
that road, it's,

00:38.168 --> 00:40.214
you... there's no turning back.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.564
It's just, like,
the dumbest hat, too, like...

00:42.607 --> 00:44.740
A hat? Are you talking
about their hair?

00:44.783 --> 00:47.090
That's hair? Oh, my...
I thought that was, like,

00:47.134 --> 00:48.222
a little comedy hat
or something.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.572
That's their actual hair...
Why would anyone do that?

00:50.615 --> 00:53.096
MAC:
Wait a second. Poppins?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.706
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my God, it's Poppins!

00:54.750 --> 00:56.578
Poppins!
He came back!

00:56.621 --> 00:58.362
My dog came back!

00:58.406 --> 00:59.581
How the hell
is that dog still alive?

00:59.624 --> 01:00.799
Yeah, Mac, why don't you just

01:00.843 --> 01:02.323
put that poor thing
out of its misery?

01:02.366 --> 01:03.802
Put him down?
What, are you crazy?

01:03.846 --> 01:05.369
This is my dog, Dee.
I love him.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.979
DEE:
Well, he doesn't love you.

01:07.023 --> 01:08.155
Comes around every
three or four years,

01:08.198 --> 01:09.808
eats a bunch of batteries
or whatever,

01:09.852 --> 01:11.593
takes a giant dump on the floor,and then leaves again.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.248
Dee, Poppins comes
and goes as he pleases

01:14.291 --> 01:15.597
'cause that's his right
as a male.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.164
-FRANK: Mm.
-Right?

01:17.207 --> 01:19.209
-Women are never gonna get that.-They'll never get it.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.515
Yep. We are
hunter-gatherers, Dee.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.169
And if we decide to leave,
we're gonna leave.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.172
-Yeah, 'cause that's nature.
That's tradition.
-That's bullshit.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.303
Traditional roles
are ridiculous,

01:26.347 --> 01:27.826
and they're made up by men.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.524
If I want to have a baby
and then abandon that baby,

01:29.567 --> 01:31.308
I have the right to do that.

01:31.352 --> 01:34.398
-Oh...
-A woman abandoning her child?

01:34.442 --> 01:35.921
-DENNIS:
Yeah, that's awful, Dee.
-FRANK: That's cheap.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.358
And it's not natural.
You know what I mean?

01:37.401 --> 01:38.402
Like those haircuts.
I mean, they...

01:38.446 --> 01:40.404
that's traditionally
a man's look.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.058
Women can't just adopt it.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.320
You know? I mean,
look, it's one thing

01:43.364 --> 01:45.192
for, like, a 60-year-old
art critic to do it,

01:45.235 --> 01:47.281
but, I mean, these are young,
sexually viable women

01:47.324 --> 01:49.413
making themselves no longer
sexually attractive to me,

01:49.457 --> 01:52.024
and that upsets
the natural balance of things.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.374
-Mm.
-DEE: What? No.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.593
If women want to get short,
ugly, lesbian haircuts,

01:55.637 --> 01:58.292
then they deserve to do that
because it's their body

01:58.335 --> 01:59.945
and, therefore, their choice.

01:59.989 --> 02:01.251
Oh, you're gonna
make it about that?

02:01.295 --> 02:03.210
You know what?
Killing babies is wrong, Dee,

02:03.253 --> 02:04.428
and God forbids it.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.604
FRANK :
Oh, God.

02:06.648 --> 02:07.736
Here comes another one.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.955
- It's too much!

02:32.500 --> 02:34.458
MAC:
I'm telling you, man,

02:34.502 --> 02:35.807
something is wrong with Poppins.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.332
His belly's all big.I've never seen him so run-down.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.681
I mean, it's not like
he's never been sick before.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.204
You remember the time he drank
an entire pot of coffee?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.206
-That wasn't good.
-No, this is different, dude.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.077
-Yeah.
-This is...
Look, check this out.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.473
-Oh, yeah. That's not good.
-Nothing. Nothing.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.649
-I mean, it's just like...

02:51.693 --> 02:53.085
Where'd you get the air horn?

02:53.129 --> 02:54.913
Oh, I-I picked it up
at the hardware store

02:54.957 --> 02:56.306
-when you were grabbing coffee.-Yeah.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.220
Yeah. Why?

02:57.264 --> 02:59.788
I want to jump-start
Poppins's system.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.442
You know? But it's not working.Maybe if I do it longer?

03:01.485 --> 03:03.270
-I'll do it super long, huh?
-Uh, you know what?

03:03.313 --> 03:05.359
-What if I feed him
my coffee, right?
-Mm-hmm. Yep.

03:05.402 --> 03:07.796
You blast him with the air horn,a-and that might wake him up.

03:07.839 --> 03:09.798
Oh, and maybe I'll scream
into the other ear.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.016
Okay, yeah. Give it a whirl.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.366
Please don't.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.237
Oh, uh, am I not doing it right?

03:14.281 --> 03:15.369
Do you want to give it a go?

03:15.412 --> 03:17.632
Uh, no, I don't. And, yes,
you're doing it correctly,

03:17.675 --> 03:20.287
I just prefer you not
feed your dog coffee

03:20.330 --> 03:22.637
and blow an air horn repeatedlyinto its ear canal.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.639
Hey, look, if that doesn't makethis dog less sleepy,

03:24.682 --> 03:27.381
-nothing's gonna.
-Well, to be clear,

03:27.424 --> 03:30.514
uh, sleepiness is not
Poppins' problem.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.647
-Oh, no. Is it a tumor?

03:32.690 --> 03:34.518
If it's not, could you say it
in that really funny

03:34.562 --> 03:36.738
Arnold Schwarzenegger voice
that's, like, so funny?

03:36.781 --> 03:38.174
-: "It's not a tumor."
-You know what I mean?
And that always, like... Yeah.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.610
-"It's not a tumor."
-It's funny
when he says it, too.

03:39.654 --> 03:40.829
Unless it is a tumor,

03:40.872 --> 03:43.179
-and then it's not
gonna be funny.
-Is it?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.964
Well, uh, there's good news
and there's bad news. Right?

03:46.008 --> 03:49.751
Uh, the good news
is that Poppins is pregnant.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.535
Wait. Poppins is a girl?

03:51.579 --> 03:55.147
Oh, you didn't know
your dog was a female?

03:55.191 --> 03:57.846
Oh, nah, I-I could never get
underneath that hind leg

03:57.889 --> 04:00.109
-to check.
-You don't want to try
to get under Poppins.

04:00.152 --> 04:02.111
I mean, one time I tried
to give him a belly scratch

04:02.154 --> 04:04.896
-and he bit my thumbnail
clean off.
-He's a monster.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.463
-Uh, "she."
-Say what now?
-Huh?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.204
"She-She's a monster."

04:08.248 --> 04:10.946
I can't believe that Poppins
is gonna be a father.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.643
-A mother.
-What?

04:12.687 --> 04:15.124
-A mother?
-He is?

04:15.167 --> 04:19.954
Hmm... Okay. Uh, do you two
not understand gender?

04:19.998 --> 04:22.087
-No, I mean...
-Well,

04:22.130 --> 04:24.525
-we don't really do gender
at our bar anymore.
-Yeah.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.440
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, gender's so,
like, old school.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.224
-Like, I-I don't identify...
-Um, I'm so sorry

04:28.268 --> 04:30.444
to tell you, uh, the bad news,

04:30.487 --> 04:34.143
is that given
Poppins' advanced age,

04:34.186 --> 04:39.322
I'm afraid that she most likelywill not survive the delivery.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.585
-He won't?
-Again, she.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.544
And, uh, yeah.

04:43.587 --> 04:46.111
: I-I don't think
I've ever seen a dog this old.

04:46.155 --> 04:50.115
It's a miracle that shewas evenable to get pregnant,

04:50.159 --> 04:53.162
so when shegives birth,

04:53.205 --> 04:56.470
shewill most likely die.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.126
Well, you got to kill
those babies, then.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.954
- Uh...
-What? Dude, what the hell?

05:02.998 --> 05:04.565
I thought you were all pro-lifeand everything.

05:04.608 --> 05:08.003
I am, but this is different.
This affects me.

05:08.046 --> 05:11.354
Uh, I'm so sorry, but we don't
perform that procedure here.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.225
We can talk to a, like,
a doctor, not a nurse.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.010
That's a good idea.
Do you have any doctors here?

05:15.053 --> 05:16.228
-Let's go.
-I'm a...

05:16.272 --> 05:17.621
Let's go. We'll go find a man.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.449
Okay.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.625
DENNIS:
Got some information for you.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.192
-You're gonna want
this information.
-Great hair. Keep the hair

05:23.235 --> 05:24.541
-the way it is.
-Very important information,
honestly.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.717
-Keep your hair the way it is.
It's really great.
-Yeah.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.197
-Oh. Oh... Hi!
-Hi... G-Going the wrong way.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.720
-You going in here
to get the... Yeah.
-I was.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.635
Check this out:
um, uh, did you know

05:31.679 --> 05:33.637
that hair only grows
about six inches

05:33.681 --> 05:35.073
over the course
of an entire year?

05:35.117 --> 05:37.424
Did you realize that?
Isn't that mind-blowing?

05:37.467 --> 05:38.729
-Think about that
for a second. You know?
-Mm.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.731
Here. Grab that for me,
if you will.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.429
-Oh, my.
-Yeah, it's something else.
-You can't get your hair cut.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.431
-You don't want to do that.
-Um, now I'll tell you
something.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.737
With luxurious locks like yours,it could take, oh,

05:46.781 --> 05:49.436
-three, four years to grow backto its current length. Yeah.-Yeah, if it ever grows back.

05:49.479 --> 05:51.394
-Okay. Thanks.
-Well, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on a second.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.962
If that doesn't convince you,
there's more. Um...

05:54.005 --> 05:56.443
Listen, are you familiar withthe television series Felicity,

05:56.486 --> 05:58.532
-starring Keri Russell? Yeah.
-Yes. Mm-hmm.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.664
-Well, this is Keri Russell
right here.
-Beautiful.

06:00.708 --> 06:03.232
-Look at her.Beautiful. Gorgeous.-Beautiful girl. Yeah, gorgeous.

06:03.275 --> 06:04.451
-Yep.
-Millions of adoring fans,

06:04.494 --> 06:07.279
hit television show, you know,and then she went and did this.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.499
-Oh, God.
-Yeah.

06:09.543 --> 06:10.979
-Look at that. Oh, God.
-What a mess.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.633
-Shocking, isn't it?
-Still pretty.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.244
With this one tragic decision,
Keri Russell a-alienated

06:15.287 --> 06:17.464
all of her fans,
she got her show canceled,

06:17.507 --> 06:19.683
-and, man, she was
never heard of ever again.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.903
Yeah, but Keri Russell
works all the time.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.687
Yeah, now,
does she still play women?

06:23.731 --> 06:25.297
Look, leave me alone, creep.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.299
-Probably in a cape
or something.
-Well, no, no, hold on.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.692
You're about to make
a huge mistake, lady.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.607
-You don't want to do this. Man.-Hey.-She got in.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.088
-What is this?
What are you guys doing?
-One got away.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.656
-We let her go.-Well, Dee, we are educatingthe public is what we're doing.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.048
-We're trying
to help these women.
-Oh, my God.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.615
Will you please leave
these poor women alone?

06:38.659 --> 06:41.488
They're clearly bored and lonelyand-and-and needing

06:41.531 --> 06:44.099
to do something extreme in orderto make themselves feel special.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.014
Listen. Take this one
for example.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.450
You don't get
a monkey cut like that

06:47.494 --> 06:48.930
unless you're broken inside.

06:48.973 --> 06:51.454
I'm sorry.
Are you talking to me?

06:51.498 --> 06:52.673
No, sweetie,
I'm talking about you.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.109
I'm using you as an example.

06:54.152 --> 06:56.938
I support your choice to look
like whatever kind of primate

06:56.981 --> 06:59.897
or simian species you choose,
because it is your choice.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.595
Okay? You know what?

07:01.638 --> 07:03.335
Go full baboon, girl.
I support you.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.859
No. Dee, Dee,
you're not being rational.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.643
Can you at least acknowledge

07:06.687 --> 07:09.167
the fact that men should have
some say in what women do

07:09.211 --> 07:10.604
with their hair?
I mean, for Christ's sakes,

07:10.647 --> 07:12.083
we're the ones that have
to look at it all day!

07:12.127 --> 07:14.085
No, Dennis.
I won't acknowledge that.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.523
You have no say.
In fact, you know what?

07:16.566 --> 07:18.873
-I'm gonna get the haircut.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.353
Don't do it, Dee. You're gonna,you're gonna look hideous.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.747
I know I will. I don't havethe face or the body to support

07:23.791 --> 07:25.314
a haircut like that,
but I'm gonna do it anyway,

07:25.357 --> 07:26.533
because I can.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.535
Because I choose to, and there'snothing you can do about it.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.971
-You don't do it.
-Excuse me.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.755
You do not do it.
You go back to the bar.

07:31.799 --> 07:32.713
I command you!

07:33.714 --> 07:34.932
Dee.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.282
You're not being serious enough.

07:37.326 --> 07:38.936
-Oh...
-One monkey cut, please!

07:38.980 --> 07:40.155
FRANK:
Oh, God.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.766
You... you bitch.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.116
CHARLIE:
Yeah, so,

07:45.160 --> 07:48.163
what we'd like you to do is killthe dog puppies, if you could.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.556
: Hey.Don't-don't say "kill," though.

07:49.599 --> 07:51.775
Uh, sorry, murder them,
if possible?

07:51.819 --> 07:53.908
-Say, uh... Uh, no, say, uh...
-Uh, sorry, my friend has a...

07:53.951 --> 07:56.519
-"...terminate the embryos."
-To terminate...

07:56.563 --> 07:59.348
-Yeah, so if you could terminatethe puppies' embryos?-Yeah.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.915
-Yeah. You know what? Come on.
Let me just-let me...
-Uh-huh. Sorry.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.004
-Hang on one second.My friend wants to talk to you.-Yeah. I'll do it.

08:03.047 --> 08:06.094
Yes, hi. Yes, we-we need you
to perform this dog abortion,

08:06.137 --> 08:08.531
and if you don't,
my dog is gonna die.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.360
And he-he-he's not gonna be
able to survive the...

08:11.403 --> 08:13.928
Yes, I'm-I'm aware that
a boy dog can't have puppies.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.583
-What's with this? I...
-I... Yes. Look,

08:16.626 --> 08:18.454
it's a little bit confusing
because he used to be...

08:18.498 --> 08:19.890
Look, there was a transition
at some point, all right?

08:19.934 --> 08:22.371
-He had a sex change.-We see past gender at our bar.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.764
And I don't...
They hung up.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.592
-That's the tenth one.
-You know what?

08:25.635 --> 08:27.158
The problem is we-we can't get
any doctors on the phone.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.030
-I know.
-You know? You're always
talking to a secretary.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.032
-I know, it's just...
-Puts you on the phone with
some other female secretary,

08:31.075 --> 08:33.121
-and it's like...-And honestly, I tune them out,

08:33.164 --> 08:35.123
because I can't... they get
so high up in the register.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.385
-Yeah.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.126
She's gone too far!
She has no idea

08:39.169 --> 08:42.217
of the ramifications of what
her actions...

08:42.260 --> 08:43.827
CHARLIE:
Whoa. Frankie.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.961
-Take it easy, buddy. Your
valve's getting all worked up.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.832
-That's not good.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.268
Hey, your valve's acting up...
You know what?

08:50.312 --> 08:51.705
Here, here-- eat some cat food.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.750
-Come on, settle down.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.839
You-you got to get
that valve down, man.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.232
-You got to calm that down,
all right?
-Okay...

08:57.275 --> 08:58.973
-Neutralize it out
with the cat food.
-Let me have it.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.975
All right, walk me through
what's happening here.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.367
-It's Dee.
-Yeah?

09:02.411 --> 09:04.456
Yeah, she's gonna do it.
She's gonna cut her hair off.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.024
Dennis... put me in charge...

09:07.068 --> 09:11.376
of making sure she doesn't
go through with this madness.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.857
Ooh, Frankie, that valveis bad, man. That is backed up.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.730
-You-you drinking
enough beer, bud?
-No.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.253
Okay. Let-Let's get you
another beer

09:18.296 --> 09:19.689
-or something.
-Let me have a brew,

09:19.733 --> 09:20.864
and pop me another can
of this cat food.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.083
-It's working.
-Yeah.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.780
We got to settle
that valve down, buddy.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.827
Hey, Frank,

09:26.870 --> 09:28.568
you know anybody
that'll do a dog abortion?

09:30.265 --> 09:32.267
Yeah, I got a guy.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.013
Yeah. There you go.
Take a look.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.015
You seriously want
to buy me a car

09:41.058 --> 09:42.407
as long as I don't cut my hair?

09:42.451 --> 09:44.627
Yeah, and we should look
at the convertibles.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.759
I want the wind blowing through

09:45.802 --> 09:48.413
those long,
beautiful locks of yours.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.632
-This is ridiculous.
-No, it's not.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.894
This has nothing to do
with a haircut

09:50.938 --> 09:53.418
and everything to do
with you controlling my body.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.725
It's got everything to do
with a haircut, Deandra.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.727
Look at this.

09:57.771 --> 09:58.902
What is this?

09:58.946 --> 10:01.513
FRANK:
That's me when I was young.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.732
I was like Samson.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.908
I had hair
down to my butt crack.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.910
I looked like a Greek god.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.042
You look like a bridge troll.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.261
Well, the point is,
I cut it all off.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.786
I-I needed the money
and I read an ad...

10:12.829 --> 10:16.311
for a toupee company that said
they would give good money

10:16.354 --> 10:18.530
for real hair, so I bought in.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.925
But I shaved it all offto the nub. It never grew back.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.492
And-and, plus,
when I think about it,

10:23.535 --> 10:25.929
I get a...
pain in my stomach

10:25.973 --> 10:28.149
and I... gastronomical.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.933
-Oh, God.
-And I burp.

10:29.977 --> 10:33.067
That's not how hair works.
Or gastrointestinal tracts.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.765
I want to show you
something else.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.159
What?

10:38.202 --> 10:39.856
FRANK:
There it is.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.945
There what is, Frank?

10:41.989 --> 10:44.731
FRANK:
That's my old hair.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.515
He-He's given it a good home.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.299
He takes care of it.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.737
Probably better than I would'vetaken care of it myself.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.608
-Wha...?
-I come by time to time

10:52.652 --> 10:54.958
to check it out,
see how it's doing.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.525
DEE:
Oh, my God.

10:56.568 --> 10:57.744
FRANK:
Ah, here he comes.

10:57.787 --> 10:58.832
Don't-don't say anything,

10:58.875 --> 11:00.964
because I don't want
to make it feel bad.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.531
-Hey, how are you?
-Hey, here's my guy.

11:02.574 --> 11:03.880
-Hi. How you doing?
-How you doing, Frankie?

11:03.924 --> 11:05.534
-Good to see you.
-Very nice to see you.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.319
I love this guy. He's bought,
like, five cars off of me.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.886
-You know?-I hope you're using that money

11:09.930 --> 11:12.497
for high-end shampoos
and conditioners.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.196
: S... Always
with the shampoo jokes.

11:15.239 --> 11:18.329
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.984
Uh, so, anyway,you here to buy something today?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.377
-Yes. Yeah.
-No! No.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.813
I-I... you're not
buying me a car, Frank.

11:23.857 --> 11:24.945
You can't control me

11:24.988 --> 11:26.947
with your cars and your threatsof male pattern

11:26.990 --> 11:27.774
baldness.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.601
That-that was an unrelated burp.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.778
I had four beers on the way
here, I'll have you know.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.127
I'm getting the haircut.
I'm getting it.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.346
Don't do it, Deandra.
You'll regret it!

11:35.390 --> 11:36.826
I'm telling you!

11:36.870 --> 11:38.567
What was that all about?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.569
Just trying to save a life.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.745
Oh. The wind's kicking up.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.313
You better get inside. I don't
like to see her struggle.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.706
Okay.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.015
You sure this is the place?

11:52.059 --> 11:54.365
Yeah. This is where Frank
said to meet the guy, so...

11:54.409 --> 11:56.019
-What up?
-Oh, hey, Z.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.238
-Hey.
-How you doing, man?

11:57.281 --> 11:59.022
-What you boys up to?
-MAC: Uh, we're waiting

11:59.066 --> 12:01.024
on a doctor that Frank's
hooking us up with.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.591
Yeah, that's me, homie.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.462
-Oh.
-You're a doctor?

12:04.506 --> 12:05.855
Straight up.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.422
Come on. No, you're not.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.380
Bitch, you don't think
I'm a doctor?

12:09.424 --> 12:12.253
I was a medic in Desert Storm.

12:12.296 --> 12:15.952
I did Doctors Without Borders,
I saved mad lives.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.389
See, you racist.
That's what the problem is.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.043
I'm so sorry, Z.
I didn't have any idea.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.393
-That's impressive, yeah.
-Sorry. Sorry.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.179
: Bitch,
I'm just playing with you.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.484
I ain't no motherfucking doctor.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.051
-Oh!

12:28.095 --> 12:30.793
-Okay. All right.
-: Are you serious?

12:30.837 --> 12:32.621
I do still feel bad, though.

12:32.664 --> 12:33.840
-I feel terrible.-I feel bad, too, because I feel

12:33.883 --> 12:35.580
-like I was exposed.
-Lesson learned.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.061
-Lesson learned. That was good.-I was... My racism was exposed.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.236
But I do fuck with dogs,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.977
-so tell me what's up.
-Oh, okay. Good.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.675
-So, uh, Poppins is sick.
-Right.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.852
Yeah, and there's a bunch
of babies in there.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.419
Oh, snap. Okay. Right.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.900
Now, the vet said that if he
gives birth, he's gonna die.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.033
Oh, so you want me
to scoop them babies out

12:53.076 --> 12:54.208
so your dog can die.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.428
-Uh, n-no.
The, the opposite, actually.
-Okay.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.475
You want me to scoop
them puppies out and chuck 'em

13:00.518 --> 13:03.478
and then put your dog
out its misery.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.001
-Uh, no. No.
-No. Uh-uh.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.047
No, uh, we want you
to kill the babies

13:07.090 --> 13:08.918
and keep this dog alive.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.877
Okay, word. I can get with that.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.705
Yeah, is there a version,
like, where no dog dies?

13:13.749 --> 13:15.055
Yo, son, that's hard to tell.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.839
I made dogs make babies,

13:16.883 --> 13:19.320
but I ain't never taken
no babies out the dog.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.669
Oh, you're a breeder.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.019
-Right.-That's why Frank hooked us up.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.674
-Yeah, yeah. I breed dogs.
-Nice.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.502
-I groom dogs. I fight dogs.
-Nice.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.851
-Oh. Mm.
-I ain't never abort

13:28.895 --> 13:30.897
no dog, but we can get it done.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.986
Poke around
in one of them trash cans,

13:33.029 --> 13:35.162
try to find an Allen wrench.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.688
Yeah, I'm starting to think
this is a mistake, man.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.472
I don't think he's qualified
to do this.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.996
-But...
-Yeah, I-I don't know.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.432
MAC:
I don't know
what else we're gonna do, man.

13:44.475 --> 13:45.912
I mean, we got to save Poppins.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.044
CHARLIE:
Oh, shit. Wait. Who's this?

13:48.088 --> 13:49.567
Oh... Oh, my God.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.352
Wait a second. Charlie...

13:51.395 --> 13:52.570
I think
this is the real Poppins!

13:52.614 --> 13:54.094
CHARLIE:
That's Poppins, isn't it?

13:54.137 --> 13:55.443
I was wondering why
I didn't have

13:55.486 --> 13:57.010
to pop this dog's eye
back in its socket.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.881
That dog has a very solid eye.
It was very mysterious why...

13:58.925 --> 14:00.709
Oh, my God.
Yeah, look how dirty he is.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.711
Oh, look. Oh, look at this.
He came back.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.147
CHARLIE:
He's getting all nose-deep

14:04.191 --> 14:05.105
in, uh...
in her goodies there, so...

14:05.148 --> 14:06.715
Oh, my God. Wait a second.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.108
Charlie,

14:08.151 --> 14:10.719
maybe the puppies inside
of this dog are Poppins's!

14:10.762 --> 14:12.721
Oh, my God.
Poppins is the dad?

14:12.764 --> 14:13.940
Yes!

14:13.983 --> 14:15.158
-CHARLIE: Uh...
-That is so cute.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.290
-Yeah.
-MAC: He came back

14:16.333 --> 14:17.726
-to take care of his family.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.467
He likes to take...Oh, no, he did not. He did not.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.990
-MAC: There he goes.
-He wanted the blanket.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.905
Yeah, he's a survivor.
He's gonna

14:22.949 --> 14:24.167
take what he needs.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.995
CHARLIE:
He's gonna do
what he's gonna do. Wow.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.083
-Bye, buddy.
-Bye, Poppins!

14:27.127 --> 14:28.563
All right.
See you in a few years.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.999
-Mm-hmm.

14:30.043 --> 14:30.957
All right. What are we gonna do

14:31.000 --> 14:32.741
-with this piece of shit?
-Mm-hmm.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.842
Listen here, you monster.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.801
Okay, well, if you see her,can you call me? I'm just really

14:49.845 --> 14:52.326
freaking out.
It's not like her at all.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.371
Um...

14:54.415 --> 14:56.112
I'm so sorry.
Um, can I help you?

14:56.156 --> 14:58.767
Yeah.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.204
Yes. I'm sorry, the...

15:01.248 --> 15:03.337
Your tears were unexpected.
I, uh...

15:03.380 --> 15:05.208
Yeah.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.818
Sometimes I find it
very arousing, tears,

15:06.862 --> 15:08.037
but this time, I wasn't...

15:08.081 --> 15:09.169
I-I wasn't coming
in-in that zone.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.432
You know what I mean?
So, I, uh, was...

15:11.475 --> 15:13.782
I just wasn't ready for it.I was... I was gonna do a th...

15:13.825 --> 15:15.436
I could switch gears, though.
You want to do...?

15:15.479 --> 15:18.134
We could do a... This could be
an arousing thing. I...

15:18.178 --> 15:19.788
What is happening?

15:19.831 --> 15:22.138
Right. Sorry. Uh...

15:22.182 --> 15:24.967
Yeah, so, no. I... No, I came
here with a plan, and, um...

15:25.011 --> 15:27.839
Yes, I'm gonna stick
to that plan, so... Sorry.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.191
-I'd like a haircut, please.
-Oh.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.367
Yeah, sure. Um, if you can justleave your name and number.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.585
What do you mean "yes"?

15:34.629 --> 15:36.196
-I can...
-Sorry. What?

15:36.239 --> 15:38.894
I can make you an appointment ifyou leave your name and number.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.895
-Right on.
-And I can

15:39.939 --> 15:42.811
-give you...
-You cut men's hair?

15:42.854 --> 15:45.031
Yeah. We cut anyone's hair
who needs it.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.164
Good. As it should be.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.211
-Good.
-Yeah.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.388
So...

15:54.431 --> 15:55.650
Are you okay?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.089
You won't outsmart me.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.222
Sorry. I-I...

16:02.265 --> 16:04.267
I thought you were gonna say
that you only cut

16:04.311 --> 16:06.269
women's hair, and I was
gonna claim discrimination

16:06.313 --> 16:08.924
to get you shut...
it doesn't matter.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.058
I have to admit, you've-you'veput me a bit out of sorts. I...

16:12.101 --> 16:14.234
With the, with the,
the tears and the...

16:14.277 --> 16:17.150
arousal
and your face and words. I...

16:17.193 --> 16:18.629
Can we start over? Uh...

16:18.673 --> 16:19.891
Do you want an appointment?

16:19.935 --> 16:22.285
No! No.

16:22.329 --> 16:25.245
I-I... Because I don't want
a-a-a haircut from a butcher.

16:25.288 --> 16:26.420
All right?
I'm not gonna get butchered

16:26.463 --> 16:28.074
like you've butchered
these poor women's hairs.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.205
-Are you insane?
-No.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.859
Look, I can be reasonable, okay?

16:30.902 --> 16:32.426
I don't expect
to save everybody from this,

16:32.469 --> 16:34.819
but I can save one person,
all right?

16:34.863 --> 16:36.125
My sister Deandra Reynolds.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.083
She-she has an appointment here,

16:37.126 --> 16:38.693
and I want it stricken
from the record.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.303
-Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
- Look,

16:40.347 --> 16:41.261
you don't understand, okay?

16:41.304 --> 16:43.959
She's... she's my twin sister,
all right?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.874
Fr-From a genetic standpoint,
I mean, her hair is just

16:45.917 --> 16:47.702
as much mine as it is hers,
you know what I mean?

16:47.745 --> 16:50.226
I-I-I... I have every right
to stop her from killing it.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.228
Okay, I don't know
what's going on here,

16:52.272 --> 16:53.882
but I don't have time for this.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.231
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're very busy

16:55.275 --> 16:57.407
destroying young people's lives,aren't you?

16:57.451 --> 17:00.454
Yeah. Doesn't surprise me
it's reduced you to tears.

17:00.497 --> 17:04.327
I'm cryingbecause my dog is lost, asshole.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.676
What's your dog look like?

17:12.378 --> 17:14.468
Oh, shit.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.257
MAC:
Well, this all worked out

17:21.300 --> 17:23.303
-pretty well, didn't it?
-Yeah, yeah.
-Well, yeah.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.479
-I can't believe how quick
you gave up Poppins's puppies,

17:25.521 --> 17:27.175
though, you know? You didn't
even think about keeping 'em.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.786
Well, that's a lot
of responsibility,

17:28.830 --> 17:30.353
-Charlie, right?
-Yeah, that's true.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.703
And plus, there's no doggypaternity test to actually prove

17:32.747 --> 17:34.270
that they were Poppy's puppies
in the first place.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.271
That's true, too.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.925
MAC:
You know? But, hey,

17:36.968 --> 17:38.883
if Poppins wants to stop by
and say, "What's up?"

17:38.927 --> 17:40.146
and, like, be a dad for while...

17:40.189 --> 17:41.364
-DENNIS: Right.
-...he's gonna.

17:41.408 --> 17:42.800
-Exactly.
-Or he won't.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.106
Yeah, that's how I do.
That's how I do.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.108
But, guys, seriously,
we got to stay vigilant, okay?

17:46.152 --> 17:47.675
I mean, yes,
we were able to stop Dee

17:47.718 --> 17:49.155
from doing something horrible.

17:49.198 --> 17:52.245
But, you know, we can't restuntil every single woman is free

17:52.288 --> 17:54.943
from the choiceof ruining their lives forever.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.205
-Mm.
-So what are we gonna do?

17:56.249 --> 17:57.250
I was thinking we use shame.

17:57.293 --> 17:58.381
-It's a great motivator.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.731
CHARLIE:
Hello... oh, my God!

18:00.775 --> 18:02.168
-Oh!
-Oh!

18:02.211 --> 18:04.996
-Oh! Aah!
-Oh, my God!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.911
-Dee, what have you done?!
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.391
I told you
I was gonna get the cut!

18:08.435 --> 18:09.610
-Goddamn it!
-Oh.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.352
But then I went into the salon,and the woman refused to see me.

18:12.395 --> 18:13.483
She refused, she said,

18:13.527 --> 18:15.050
'cause she was-she was doing
some sort of trade

18:15.094 --> 18:16.834
in a dog-kidnapped situation.
I don't know.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.750
I ended up having to do it
all by myself! That's right!

18:19.794 --> 18:21.143
-Listen, l-listen.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.971
-It looks... terrible.
-DEE: I...

18:23.014 --> 18:24.407
-So bad.
-I mean, really, really bad.

18:24.451 --> 18:27.149
I know it looks terrible!
The scissors were dirty,

18:27.193 --> 18:28.368
and they weren't even sharp.

18:28.411 --> 18:29.804
But now it's done.
It's done now.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.327
There's no turning back.

18:31.371 --> 18:32.589
What have I done?
What have I done?

18:32.633 --> 18:35.418
I've-I've forced my sister
into a back-alley chop.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.551
Guys, I think we-we need
to realize something.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.030
We're never gonna be able
to stop women

18:39.074 --> 18:40.815
from doing whatever the hellthey want with their own bodies.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.425
-Thank you!
-Okay?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.166
And if we can't stop them
from making stupid

18:44.210 --> 18:46.212
and selfish choices, then
we need to give them a place

18:46.255 --> 18:47.387
to go to bestupid and selfish.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.866
-Thank you.
-Where it's safe.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.303
-Yes!
-Where they won't do bullshit
like this.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.435
-It's bullshit!
-This is a bullshit haircut!

18:52.479 --> 18:53.436
I know!

18:53.480 --> 18:56.309
Okay, guys,
here's something else, too.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.398
I don't care about any
of this, really, you know?

18:58.441 --> 19:00.443
If I'm being honest,I don't care that much, either.

19:00.487 --> 19:01.401
-Right?
-DEE: Oh...

19:01.444 --> 19:02.793
-Like, who gives a shit?
-Yeah.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.317
Yeah, I guess I don't really
care that much, either.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.405
-What?! No, you... No.
-I don't know,

19:05.448 --> 19:07.276
it just... it's annoying,
but I don't care.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.452
We don't really care.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.801
Why did you guys makesuch a big deal about it, then?

19:10.845 --> 19:13.239
Well, uh, you know,
that's, like, a guy thing.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.240
Well, 'cause we're-we're used
to being in charge,

19:14.283 --> 19:15.458
and we want to make sure that...

19:15.502 --> 19:17.286
You did! You cared!
You cared so much,

19:17.330 --> 19:20.071
and then I did it, and now
what am I supposed to do?

19:20.115 --> 19:22.683
-I care. I know what to do.
-You do?

19:22.726 --> 19:24.293
I got a guy.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.254
-Hey.
-FRANK: Oh.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.256
How that wig feel, Dee?

19:30.299 --> 19:31.692
-Really good.
-FRANK: Oh.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.128
It feels great. Thank you, Z.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.392
Now, Dee, just rememberthat one day you may get a call

19:36.436 --> 19:38.481
from the woman
who gave birth to that hair.

19:38.525 --> 19:43.094
And, uh, I would consider
some visitations.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.835
Nah, she ain't got
to worry about that.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.142
I groomed that shit
off a border collie.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.578
Well, then you're good.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.190
Hey. Might be some fleas
up in there, but she good.
