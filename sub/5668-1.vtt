MAN ON TABLET: Mate, mate,
 mate... Hang on, hang on,
 hang on. Okay.

05:16.462 --> 05:17.742
That's a fucking panther.

05:27.085 --> 05:28.686
That, that is
 going on YouTube.

05:30.925 --> 05:34.286
MATT: Well, it's definitely
 not four otters synchronized
 swimming this time.

05:35.758 --> 05:36.974
Very funny.

05:37.007 --> 05:40.206
I was kind of hoping
we could go on a normal
vacation this year,

05:40.238 --> 05:45.325
you know, sun, beach lounger,
 no waiting around for
 an amphibious sea monster

05:45.358 --> 05:47.502
-named Nessie
 to pop up for air.
 -(LAUGHING)

05:47.534 --> 05:49.518
It's gonna be
 different this time,

05:49.550 --> 05:52.045
southwest England
 is in the middle
 of a huge cat flap.

05:52.078 --> 05:53.614
(SCOFFS)

05:53.646 --> 05:56.238
There's been over 20
 livestock attacks around
 Xmoor in the last two months

05:56.270 --> 05:59.598
and nobody's managed
 to get a decent shot
 of the cat.

05:59.630 --> 06:03.342
And... I haven't showed
you the best bit.

06:04.429 --> 06:05.582
MATT: 25,000?

06:05.615 --> 06:08.495
GEORGIA: That's
 almost 40,000 US.

06:08.527 --> 06:11.149
Just think of the places
we could go and shoot
on that money.

06:11.182 --> 06:13.038
There's no way they'd be
 offering that kind of money

06:13.069 --> 06:15.182
if they really think
 something's out there.

06:15.215 --> 06:17.582
Well, the sheep aren't
 killing themselves.

06:17.614 --> 06:20.174
Remember what we agreed
 before about expectations?

06:21.967 --> 06:23.406
Not to have any?

06:23.438 --> 06:26.094
I just don't want to see you
 get disappointed again.

06:26.126 --> 06:28.878
Or eaten by a panther,
 don't know what'd be worse.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.990
(LAUGHING)

06:31.022 --> 06:32.783
Remind me why I'm with you.

06:32.814 --> 06:35.342
I carry the equipment.

06:37.646 --> 06:43.151
Whoa! Was your boss cool
 with you taking all this?

06:43.182 --> 06:46.734
Yeah. As long as we
 get it back before
 he notices it's gone.

06:48.558 --> 06:50.254
You didn't tell him?

06:50.286 --> 06:51.469
Well, he never asked.

06:53.711 --> 06:56.814
Seriously, Matt. I can't
 believe you did this for me.

06:58.254 --> 06:59.278
Thank you.

06:59.310 --> 07:00.782
It's okay.

07:00.814 --> 07:03.503
-But I'll drive.
-Oh, hey, wait a... Oh.

07:29.742 --> 07:32.878
MATT: I can't even deal with
 an eight pound domestic cat.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.374
How we gonna catch
 up with a 200 pound
 wild son of a bitch

07:35.406 --> 07:37.262
that belongs in the zoo?

07:37.294 --> 07:39.918
You worry about cameras,
 animal tracker finds the cats.

07:39.950 --> 07:43.438
Oh, yeah.
 The fantastic Mr. Fox.

07:43.470 --> 07:45.262
The idea there's a second dude
 crazy enough to go

07:45.294 --> 07:47.790
monster hunting with you
is a fucking trip.

07:49.198 --> 07:50.574
He's retarded, right?

07:51.182 --> 07:52.718
I gotta meet this guy.

07:54.254 --> 07:55.214
Whoa!

07:56.845 --> 07:57.902
GEORGIA: Okay.

08:07.727 --> 08:09.742
Is there another way
 we can go?

08:09.774 --> 08:11.662
No, this is the only road.

08:13.614 --> 08:15.054
They're definitely
 fucking with us.

08:16.175 --> 08:17.902
-Maybe they're sick.
 -In the head?

08:19.118 --> 08:20.910
-They might need help.
 -I don't think so.

08:20.942 --> 08:24.718
What are you... Oh, man!

08:24.750 --> 08:25.742
(SIGHING)

08:27.565 --> 08:29.006
Hello?

08:57.102 --> 08:59.118
I don't think
 that's their car.

09:00.814 --> 09:02.606
Hey, are you guys okay?

09:04.942 --> 09:05.902
MATT: What the fuck?

09:07.470 --> 09:09.646
-Oh, shit!
 -Oh, my God.

09:11.086 --> 09:12.685
-Oh, shit!
-(MEN LAUGHING)

09:12.718 --> 09:15.182
Fuck! Move, come on! Run!

09:17.742 --> 09:18.862
Go. Go, go, go!

09:18.894 --> 09:20.910
-GEORGIA: Seat belts on!
-Come on!

09:23.182 --> 09:24.462
MATT:
 Can you make it go any faster?

09:24.494 --> 09:26.189
Oh, you hired
 this piece of shit!

09:31.566 --> 09:33.805
(PANTING)

09:33.838 --> 09:36.622
After these assholes,
 a giant man-eating cat...

09:37.838 --> 09:39.469
Oh, shit!

09:45.325 --> 09:48.431
I guess there's more to
England than Supernanny
 and Prince Harry.

10:30.478 --> 10:33.229
MATT: I'm beginning to doubt
 this farmhouse will have HBO.

10:33.262 --> 10:34.702
GEORGIA: Mmm.

10:34.734 --> 10:35.790
MATT: Running water?

10:50.286 --> 10:51.342
Hello?

10:55.598 --> 10:56.590
Fox?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.446
(DOOR CREAKING)

11:02.478 --> 11:03.598
MATT: It's open.

11:08.366 --> 11:11.855
If he didn't answer,
 it means he's probably gone.

11:11.886 --> 11:13.070
Gone where?

11:13.102 --> 11:15.438
Milk a horse for breakfast?
 How the fuck would I know?

11:15.469 --> 11:16.429

11:22.446 --> 11:23.790
-(SQUAWKING)
-(GEORGIA YELPS)

11:26.318 --> 11:27.342
It's just a bird.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.382
Fox?

11:37.709 --> 11:38.958
Are you in here?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.638
It's me, Georgia.

11:45.133 --> 11:46.798
MATT: Nice.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.173
(INSECT BUZZING)

11:49.229 --> 11:51.246
Was this dude
 a fucking junkie?

11:53.838 --> 11:56.557
Ahh! Get out! Go!
 Get out of here!

11:56.590 --> 11:58.030
-Okay.
 -Come on.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.854
Great start, he's probably
 been murdered by crackheads.

12:06.317 --> 12:07.886
Or sacrificed like
 the Wicker Man.

12:10.766 --> 12:12.046
Get out of here.

12:16.877 --> 12:17.837
Or not.

12:20.366 --> 12:21.326
(FLIES BUZZING)

12:30.445 --> 12:32.302
Why would anyone want
 to set fire to sheep?

12:35.662 --> 12:37.262
GEORGIA: Let's ask him.

12:45.869 --> 12:46.894
Hey.

12:46.926 --> 12:48.238
Hey.

12:50.926 --> 12:52.237
All right already.

12:53.710 --> 12:54.670
(CHUCKLING)

12:56.941 --> 12:57.934
Who's this?

12:57.966 --> 13:00.109
Uh, Matt, this is Conrad Fox.

13:00.142 --> 13:01.198
Fox, this is Matt.

13:01.229 --> 13:03.182
I thought you were
 coming alone.

13:03.214 --> 13:06.541
(LAUGHING) I told you about
 my boyfriend. Matt. Remember?

13:08.461 --> 13:10.254
Right, yeah.

13:10.285 --> 13:13.134
Nice to meet you, man.
I heard a lot about you.

13:15.790 --> 13:16.782
Welcome to Xmoor.

13:18.894 --> 13:20.365
So what happened
to these sheep?

13:21.614 --> 13:23.694
They were left behind,
 became easy prey.

13:23.725 --> 13:24.942
You mean a cat killed them?

13:24.973 --> 13:26.605
Those that didn't starve.

13:26.638 --> 13:28.942
(COUGHING)

13:29.933 --> 13:31.405
You all right?

13:33.262 --> 13:36.205
So, the people who
 lived here before,
 did they see the cat?

13:36.238 --> 13:38.509
They were too concerned
with keeping the wolf
from the door.

13:40.462 --> 13:41.678
Well, they better not
 come back here

13:41.710 --> 13:43.854
'cause there's a crazy drug
 addict living in their house.

13:43.885 --> 13:46.382
-(CHUCKLES)
 -Have you seen her?

13:46.414 --> 13:47.662
I brought her.

13:56.749 --> 13:57.998
GEORGIA:
 Can you tell us your name?

14:01.357 --> 14:02.669
Just ask her about the beast.

14:06.286 --> 14:07.726
Can you describe
what happened?

14:10.861 --> 14:12.077
KARA: It were last month.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.206
I was lost.

14:16.238 --> 14:18.670
The mist had come down
 and I couldn't see
 where I was going.

14:21.198 --> 14:25.198
I heard a noise
behind me and...

14:25.230 --> 14:28.718
All of a sudden,
 the beast come out of nowhere
 and knocked me over.

14:29.806 --> 14:32.014
I didn't know what hit me.

14:32.046 --> 14:35.245
He held me down and
 tried to bite my throat out.

14:37.582 --> 14:38.766
How can you be sure
 it was a male?

14:41.230 --> 14:42.286
Males are more aggressive.

14:51.469 --> 14:52.462
Were you badly hurt?

14:53.646 --> 14:54.990
Did you think it was
 gonna kill you?

14:57.262 --> 14:58.253
Yeah.

14:59.694 --> 15:03.821
If I hadn't of got away,
I'd be lying dead on
that moor right now.

15:08.014 --> 15:09.613
We should have
 never come back here.

15:17.582 --> 15:19.021
How did you get away
 from the beast?

15:19.854 --> 15:22.349
I ran until my feet bled.

15:29.677 --> 15:32.653
Those scars on your arms,
 are they from the beast?

15:33.550 --> 15:34.990
I don't want to
do this no more.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.029
(SOBBING)

15:38.062 --> 15:39.758
She's still very traumatized.

15:41.710 --> 15:42.670
(DOOR CLOSING)

15:43.726 --> 15:45.550
-It's what we agreed.
 -That's it?

15:45.582 --> 15:47.182
It's all I've got and
 it's what we agreed, okay?

15:47.213 --> 15:49.102
Yeah, but you never
 said you were gonna
 film me, did you?

15:50.574 --> 15:51.949
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

15:57.166 --> 15:58.765
Is the mic on that camera
 picking anything up?

16:02.094 --> 16:03.310
No, too far away.

16:06.157 --> 16:08.462
Well, she's more
 than just camera shy.

16:08.494 --> 16:09.901
She's a fucking meth head.

16:12.109 --> 16:14.222
What were you saying
 about this dude again?

16:14.254 --> 16:17.037
-Do you want a repeat
 of the Sasquatch trip?
 -Mmm-mmm.

16:17.069 --> 16:19.309
Fox is an animal tracker,
 we don't have a hope in hell

16:19.342 --> 16:20.942
of finding any
 big cats without him.

16:20.974 --> 16:24.461
Okay and what is
 Doctor Dolittle
 using for guidance?

16:24.493 --> 16:28.333
Hmm, is that
directions scribbled out
by a crack whore?

16:28.366 --> 16:29.678
(LAUGHING) Why, yes it is.

16:31.246 --> 16:34.157
What exactly does this dude
 know about animals?

16:34.189 --> 16:36.814
He's got over 20 years'
 experience tracking big cats

16:36.845 --> 16:38.734
in Peru, Buton,
 and South Africa.

16:39.949 --> 16:41.710
Where do you think
 he dug up Skeletor?

16:41.741 --> 16:45.133
Come on, Matt, not everyone
 is as lucky as we are.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.541
I'm sure he could afford
a couple of items

16:46.573 --> 16:48.174
off the dollar menu
 for his girlfriend.

16:49.453 --> 16:50.989
She's not his girlfriend.

16:51.022 --> 16:52.237
-How do you...
 -(CELL PHONE RINGING)

16:55.598 --> 16:58.702
-Oh, shit, it's my boss.
-Don't answer it.

16:58.734 --> 17:00.398
No, no, no, no. I got to.
 It's like 3:00 a.m. there.

17:00.430 --> 17:02.093
He must be calling
 about the cameras.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.621

 How are you?

17:04.654 --> 17:06.094

 OVER THE PHONE)

17:06.126 --> 17:09.358
Not good. Okay, uh, what?

Did you hear that?

17:46.925 --> 17:48.334

 Hold her down.

 who burned out the car.

18:58.606 --> 19:01.965
And they were going through
 our stuff and when they
 saw me, they...

19:01.997 --> 19:04.302

 They grabbed me.

MATT: He was gonna kill
 that kid, wasn't he?

19:07.725 --> 19:09.037
Did you see
 the size of that gun?

19:11.565 --> 19:13.261
He was only trying
 to protect me.

19:18.317 --> 19:19.437
He isn't a threat.

19:21.678 --> 19:23.053
MATT: I hope you're right.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.725
We should get going.

Don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

20:12.877 --> 20:14.509

 offer to give her a ride?

20:14.542 --> 20:18.669
There isn't time.
 We've got a lot of ground
 to cover in the light.

20:18.701 --> 20:20.717
Well, what if those
 guys come back
 and she's here all alone?

20:20.749 --> 20:21.966
(LAUGHING) They wouldn't dare.

20:22.894 --> 20:24.269
Seriously, Fox,
 this isn't right.

-In need of
a couple of days detox.

Dude, that's cold.

20:32.653 --> 20:34.029
Well, believe me,
 she's better off there

20:34.061 --> 20:35.245
than back on the moor.

20:54.733 --> 20:57.133
MATT: How big is the moor?

20:57.165 --> 21:00.013

21:07.309 --> 21:09.934
The biggest hunt was
 Operation Beastie in '83.

21:11.501 --> 21:15.085
The army sent 40 soldiers
 out for a fortnight.
 They saw a cat,

21:15.118 --> 21:17.038
but couldn't get
 a clean shot on it.

21:17.069 --> 21:20.077
MATT: Oh, and if the military
 can't find him, what
 chance do we have?

21:21.613 --> 21:24.557
That's what they said when
 I hunted down the blue tiger.

21:24.589 --> 21:28.044
You know, Fox, I think it'd
 make a better documentary
 if we didn't kill the cat.

21:28.077 --> 21:31.789
Then you should have hired
 David Bellamy. I'm a hunter.

21:31.821 --> 21:33.901

 is David Bellamy?

21:39.757 --> 21:41.069
Should I start getting
 these set up?

21:42.637 --> 21:44.429
Not yet, wait until
 he gets the scent.

21:44.909 --> 21:45.965
This way.

21:50.733 --> 21:54.445

 the scent... Of bullshit.

 it'll be before we see
 evidence of the panther?

22:36.941 --> 22:40.557
Um, there's no such
 thing as a panther.

22:40.589 --> 22:44.110
-But you said that...
 -Escaped cats were
 melanistic leopards.

22:44.141 --> 22:47.917
The theory is that they
 interbred with other species
 of anomalous cats

22:47.950 --> 22:51.405
-over the years to create
 breeds like the pumapard.

 we've been walking all day

23:43.917 --> 23:45.646

 think that Captain Ahab

23:45.677 --> 23:47.148
couldn't find a kid
 in a ball of string.

23:49.068 --> 23:53.197
Shouldn't we be heading
back to civilization
before it gets too dark?

23:53.230 --> 23:56.493
Aw! Why do we need to find
 the cat when we already have

23:56.525 --> 23:58.349
the biggest pussy
 in England right here?

If we tell the police now,
 that beast will get away.

30:24.717 --> 30:28.492

 There are dead girls in there

30:35.020 --> 30:39.820
it's like Matthew said,
 when someone creates
 a dumping ground like that,

30:39.852 --> 30:42.957
they tend to make
 a habit of returning
 to it very regularly.

30:42.988 --> 30:47.692
Listen, Georgia, the police
 are bound by procedure.

30:49.037 --> 30:52.044
They're obliged to
 remove the bodies immediately.

30:52.077 --> 30:54.348
But if they were to leave
 them there and wait,

30:54.381 --> 30:57.100
there's a good chance the
 killer would walk into a trap.

 I think you're suggesting...

30:59.341 --> 31:02.541

 of a serial killer

to catch a serial killer

 whatever happens, we go
 and report what we found.

 you find this maniac?

31:29.261 --> 31:32.013

catching a serial killer

31:32.045 --> 31:34.157

 of the police

 fucking foolish to see it.

31:47.597 --> 31:49.389

 about finding the cat,

31:49.421 --> 31:52.653
it was all about
 setting him up as
 the hero of the ultimate hunt,

31:52.684 --> 31:54.892
the most dangerous game
 of all, isn't that right, Fox?

31:54.924 --> 31:56.620

 he wouldn't lie about...

My fiance Camille was murdered
 in South Africa two years ago.

 I knew had long since gone.

 I met a girl called Allison.

 I hadn't died, with Camille.

32:53.356 --> 32:57.869
Anyway, one day she
 wasn't there anymore,
 she wasn't anywhere.

32:57.900 --> 33:02.573

 several girls had disappeared,
 and no one seemed to care.

 never seen a cat!

 out here, had a look,

 but believe me,

 and I wouldn't risk
 crossing the moor at night.

35:40.077 --> 35:41.484
Can you make it back
 to van on that...

35:41.516 --> 35:44.109
It's a day away, two perhaps
 with a sprained ankle.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.292
What if we both help him?

35:45.324 --> 35:48.748
We need to get him proper
 bandages and dry clothes

35:48.780 --> 35:51.501
from his bag or he'll
 die of hypothermia.

35:57.740 --> 36:00.396
I followed you two for about
 a mile and you didn't notice.

36:00.429 --> 36:02.540
I might not have
 been the only one.

36:02.572 --> 36:05.613
(SHIVERING) So, we go back
 to the forest, and what then?

36:05.645 --> 36:06.797
We get you changed,
 then we wait.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.708
And what if the beast shows?

36:09.741 --> 36:12.908
You film me apprehending him
 and we take him to the law.

36:12.940 --> 36:15.116
This isn't The Cat of
 the Baskervilles!

36:15.148 --> 36:18.828
He's one overconfident,
unarmed loner,

36:18.860 --> 36:20.716
who won't be expecting
 an armed hunter

36:20.748 --> 36:22.413
or our eyes in the trees.

36:22.444 --> 36:24.909
Bullshit, we can't
 do this. Matt!

36:24.941 --> 36:27.084
The girl I met in the Red Line
 that night spoke until dawn

36:27.117 --> 36:29.324
about how she wanted
her films to be noticed.

36:29.356 --> 36:32.621
I've spent my entire life
 hunting innocent animals,

36:32.652 --> 36:36.844
you spent yours trying
 to film figments
 of people's imaginations.

36:36.876 --> 36:39.148
Now we've got a chance
 to do something real.

36:39.180 --> 36:42.540
Something that matters!
 And you want to run away!

36:42.573 --> 36:45.357
The only thing that matters to
 me right now is staying alive.

36:45.388 --> 36:46.668
You really think
 you can protect her?

36:48.333 --> 36:49.932
With my life.

36:49.965 --> 36:52.941
You can't be serious right
 now. We need the cops
 and we need them now!

36:52.972 --> 36:56.908
I can't protect you,
 I couldn't before at the house
 and I can't do shit now.

36:56.940 --> 36:59.084
Don't say that. We're
 gonna tighten this up,

36:59.116 --> 37:01.452
we're gonna grab you
 over our shoulders and
 we're gonna make it back.

37:01.485 --> 37:04.876
I don't think we can make it
 across the moor alone.

37:04.908 --> 37:07.820
Our best chance to
 stay alive today is with Fox.

37:09.580 --> 37:12.556
So promise me when this
 is over, you'll stay away from
 that motherfucker.
