30:01.509 --> 30:04.051

<i> gauntlet weapon developed</i>

<i> by the Marathas</i>
<i> of central India.</i>

30:08.599 --> 30:10.432

30:12.561 --> 30:14.394

<i> it was featured in</i>
<i>the cult classic film "Willow."</i>

30:17.191 --> 30:19.191
<i> Instead of featuring</i>
<i> a guard like most swords,</i>

30:19.235 --> 30:21.235
<i> it had a steel gauntlet</i>

30:21.278 --> 30:23.821
<i> that would cover the hand</i>
<i>and sometimes even the forearm.</i>

30:23.864 --> 30:25.656
<i> With their arm strapped</i>
<i> inside of the gauntlet,</i>

<i> the user would not have</i>
<i> the use of their wrist.</i>

30:28.035 --> 30:30.619

30:30.663 --> 30:32.746

30:32.790 --> 30:35.499
<i> While the pata was commonly</i>
<i> used by mounted warriors,</i>

30:35.543 --> 30:37.417
<i> its design allowed</i>
<i> even a soldier on foot</i>

30:37.461 --> 30:39.503
<i> to strike from</i>
<i> a wider variety of angles</i>

30:39.547 --> 30:42.714

<i> a conventional sword.</i>

30:42.758 --> 30:46.093

37:02.095 --> 37:05.388
On the motion,

37:05.432 --> 37:07.307
A little bit heavy
for the gauntlet there,

37:07.351 --> 37:09.434
but it is wicked sharp.

- Good job.

it's very heavy, hard to handle

37:51.061 --> 37:52.394
