00:35.785 --> 00:36.995
<i>He was a cop.</i>

Pildo.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.845
How's Captain?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.930
He's still in surgery.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.974
It's been over four hours.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.279
I brought him home last night.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.366
He seemed nervous,
so I offered to stay with him, but…

01:18.411 --> 01:21.915
I'm sure Choi Mujin was behind it,
but I don't know why.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.210
Why Captain?

01:28.004 --> 01:29.297
We'll catch the assailant soon.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.299
Captain shot him.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.594
We found blood and fingerprints
at the scene.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.518
Why do you look so pale?

01:45.146 --> 01:46.523
I didn't sleep well.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.444
Hey.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.446
It didn't record?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.658
Get all the surveillance videos nearby.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.660
Okay. I'll go too.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.961
The surgery went well.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.589
We'll move him to the ICU and monitor him.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.471
<i>Cha Giho survived.</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:20.223
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

02:24.811 --> 02:27.313
<i>Jiwoo was there at the scene.</i>

02:28.690 --> 02:30.316
<i>She may have found out the truth.</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:32.652
<i>We must kill her.</i>

03:51.189 --> 03:52.190
Captain.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.757
<i>What will you do if you find
the asshole who killed your sister?</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:20.301
What if you find him…

04:23.012 --> 04:24.222
but there's no evidence?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.809
<i>We'll get Choi Mujin first</i>

04:28.643 --> 04:30.144

04:39.487 --> 04:41.656
<i>You should stay put for the time being.</i>

04:41.739 --> 04:45.493
<i>The police are after you
for Gangjae's murder.</i>

05:04.470 --> 05:05.930

05:09.726 --> 05:10.560
Let her.

JEON PILDO

07:02.588 --> 07:03.798
Come here, kid!

08:16.245 --> 08:17.413
I told you

08:18.789 --> 08:19.916
it was foolish.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.004
You're a traitor's daughter,

08:25.087 --> 08:26.964
but you said you'd kill the culprit.

08:29.091 --> 08:29.926
<i>I served Donghoon</i>

08:30.426 --> 08:31.761
very closely.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.472
He didn't belong in a crime ring.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.897
How does it feel to have lived cluelessly
as our pawn?

08:53.157 --> 08:54.867
You killed my dad, didn't you?

08:56.202 --> 08:58.329
I wanted to kill him myself.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.501
You've never seen the real Choi Mujin.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.675
He always kills traitors personally.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.763
To watch them take their final breath.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.685
I wonder how your dad looked then.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.106
How will you look when you die?

09:27.483 --> 09:28.651
Let's find out.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.675
Do you assholes think you're human?

11:16.842 --> 11:17.843
What about…

11:19.345 --> 11:20.221
you?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.515
Are you still human?

11:34.276 --> 11:35.569
Did you get the videos?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.030
Yes. From all the streets nearby.

11:38.114 --> 11:38.948
Let's see.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.576
Narcotics, Detective Na Daesoo speaking.

11:43.077 --> 11:43.953
Yes.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.414
Yes, what I asked for before.

11:49.083 --> 11:49.917
Yes.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.087
Where is that?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.383
Okay.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.010
So, 7-35?

12:00.511 --> 12:01.554
Okay. Thank you.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.681
Please head out first.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.890
We'll be close behind.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.434
Thank you.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.811
-Let's go.
-Where?

12:09.645 --> 12:11.814
A retired doctor
who lives near the tunnel said

12:11.897 --> 12:14.191
he treated a man in his 50s
with a stab wound 3 days ago.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.861
-Where?
-Cheonwang Temple.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.837

Hey.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.068
COME IN ASAP
WE GOT CHOI MUJIN

13:24.637 --> 13:25.721
You did this, right?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.280
Captain Cha Giho, too.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.953
Why did you do it?

13:51.288 --> 13:52.665
Why did you turn yourself in?

13:57.586 --> 13:59.338
Were you scared after stabbing a cop?

14:01.423 --> 14:02.883
Did you feel like it was over?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.554
There are various people in the world.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.393
Everyone thinks they're special.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.442
But if you look carefully,

14:22.278 --> 14:23.696
it's one or the other.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.784
Predator…

14:31.078 --> 14:32.121
or prey.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.667
Either you eat or get eaten.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.630
Cha Giho was prey
pretending to be a predator.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.967
So he won't live long.

14:48.971 --> 14:49.847
And you?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.143
Which do you think you are?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.063
You killed people,

14:58.772 --> 14:59.773
sold drugs,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.069
and did all sorts of nasty things.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.948
And that's your excuse?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.662
You had to live this way
because you're a predator?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.250
The premise itself is wrong.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.797
Think it over slowly
while you're in a cell.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.540

15:59.833 --> 16:02.419
He's either cornered
or has something up his sleeve.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.881
That asshole's done for
once Captain wakes up.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.969

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053

-Oh Hyejin

26:52.819 --> 26:54.279

30:53.893 --> 30:54.978
This is my knife.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.900
Kill him as soon as you find him.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.673
<i>Taeju, come here.</i>

31:23.756 --> 31:25.383
<i>-Come here.
-Take one with us.</i>

31:38.229 --> 31:40.273
We'll go and get that bitch.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.945
Do you know where she is?

31:49.824 --> 31:50.825
Wait.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.537
She'll come on her own.

32:04.672 --> 32:06.341
Her life's goal…

32:08.801 --> 32:09.719
is me.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.602
My dad and I promised we'd build a house
on a beach and live there.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.648
If he hadn't killed Dad…

32:25.985 --> 32:27.528
would I have been able to live like that?

33:42.520 --> 33:48.276
PUREUNSOL MEMORIAL PARK

33:50.695 --> 33:53.364
PUREUNSOL MEMORIAL PARK
MAINTENANCE RECEIPT

33:53.448 --> 33:55.450
NEXT OF KIN: SONG JOONSU

33:56.034 --> 33:57.952
RECIPIENT: CHA GIHO

34:04.917 --> 34:05.793
Hey.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.546
Pildo. I just heard back.

34:09.464 --> 34:12.216
Her prints aren't in the system.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.134
That bitch…

34:14.719 --> 34:17.221
She didn't even register her fingerprints.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.225
That means
Dongcheon bred her meticulously.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.144
It's a mess in here.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.563
Pildo. You need to get over here.

34:25.646 --> 34:28.649
DO NOT ENTER
UNDER INVESTIGATION

35:03.184 --> 35:06.687
DECEASED, KIM JEONGA

35:17.073 --> 35:18.491
Sorry, Dad.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.329
I didn't know how you had been living.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.961
If I had, rather than hating
and resenting you,

35:32.130 --> 35:33.840
I would've hugged you more.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.928
It must've been so lonely and exhausting.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.058
I think I can understand you now.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.896
I miss you,

35:49.939 --> 35:50.940
Dad.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.578
Damn.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.205
Hey.

36:07.373 --> 36:09.125
What do you make of this?

36:09.208 --> 36:10.751
Something definitely happened.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.379
Her things are all gone.

36:14.630 --> 36:15.882
And there's no one here.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.094
Maybe Choi Mujin
already cleared the place out.

36:21.053 --> 36:22.221
Damn it.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.770
Tonight isn't…

36:34.192 --> 36:36.194
DECEASED, KIM JEONGA

36:37.403 --> 36:38.696
I'll be back, Dad.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.116
Watch.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.786
See how I end this.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.062
Freeze!

37:56.482 --> 37:57.316
Turn around.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.947
Don't test me anymore.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.201
You've toyed with me enough.

38:18.587 --> 38:19.588
Put your hands up.

38:33.227 --> 38:37.231
You are under arrest for obstruction
of justice and attempted murder.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.445
You have the right to an attorney.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.572
You may testify on your behalf.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.701
You may challenge
the properness of the arrest.

38:51.662 --> 38:56.292
A SAFE AND CLEAN CITY FULL OF HOPE

39:24.278 --> 39:25.613
-Damn it.
-Sir.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.531
Let go.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.159
To think I considered her a colleague.
Hey. Look up.

39:30.659 --> 39:31.827
Hey.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.662
Your life is over,

39:33.746 --> 39:35.373
you traitor asshole.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.083
Bitch.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.293
Let go.

39:39.919 --> 39:40.753
Let go of me!

39:51.639 --> 39:52.807
Can we get her out?

39:53.516 --> 39:56.769
She stole evidence from the police
and was caught on camera doing it.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.729
There's no way.

39:58.813 --> 39:59.772
We must get her out.

40:00.648 --> 40:01.816
In case she confesses?

40:03.150 --> 40:04.235
She won't confess.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.780
She's probably waiting for me
to do something.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.617
You said she killed Mr. Jung
and will come to kill you.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.745
Are you saying you'll make her come?

40:32.513 --> 40:33.722
Give us some privacy.

40:33.806 --> 40:34.723
Yes, sir.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.821
Captain was suspicious of you.

40:50.364 --> 40:51.699
Is that why you stabbed him?

40:52.825 --> 40:54.410
In case he'd expose your identity?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.542
Why did you thank me?

41:04.128 --> 41:05.546
For being fooled?

41:07.923 --> 41:08.841
Tell me.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.970
Make an excuse. Lie. Say something!

41:19.935 --> 41:21.145
I trusted you.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.109
I didn't stab the Captain.

41:36.410 --> 41:37.495
If I tell you,

41:41.123 --> 41:42.374
would you believe me?

41:57.264 --> 41:59.850
No, I can't. Not a single word.

42:24.708 --> 42:27.127
OH HYEJIN

42:42.393 --> 42:43.269
Name.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.023
What's your name?

42:56.615 --> 42:58.117
What's your real name?

44:08.354 --> 44:13.359
