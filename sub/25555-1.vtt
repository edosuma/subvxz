22:58.477 --> 23:00.612
{\an8}Like, like...
(imitates explosion)

23:00.679 --> 23:01.880
{\an1}Nilsa's stuff
is in your room.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.382
All right,
so who moved her (bleep)?

23:04.449 --> 23:05.717
Who touched her (bleep)?

23:05.784 --> 23:07.018
She didn't move... she
didn't move her stuff.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.086
{\an1}Yeah, who touched
your (bleep)?

23:08.153 --> 23:09.454
Find who touched your shoes.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.323
{\an1}Yeah, find who
touched your (bleep),

23:11.389 --> 23:13.091
{\an5}'cause I'm gonna beat
their ass!
Kortni.

23:13.158 --> 23:16.561
{\an5}(overlapping shouting)

23:13.158 --> 23:16.561
(laughter)

23:16.628 --> 23:18.697
{\an1}Well, that escalated
a little worse

23:18.764 --> 23:20.432
{\an1}than I thought,
to be honest.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.467
{\an5}(Gus)
I planned on telling her
the whole time,

23:22.534 --> 23:23.902
{\an8}but with the way she's acting
now, I'm kind of scared.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.504
{\an8}I'm gonna sit back
and not say nothing.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.707
Everybody come the (bleep)
downstairs!

23:28.774 --> 23:30.208
{\an1}I gotta take a (bleep).
Hold on.

23:30.275 --> 23:32.744
{\an5}(Codi)
Kortni's losing it.
I run into the bathroom.

23:32.811 --> 23:34.713
Where do you go
when a tornado comes?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.481
Where I'm from,
you get in the bathroom.

23:36.548 --> 23:37.783
{\an5}I'm taking a (bleep).

23:36.548 --> 23:37.783
(toilet flushes)

23:37.849 --> 23:39.551
Come the (bleep) down here

23:39.618 --> 23:42.788
before I drag your ass
down the goddamn stairs!

23:42.854 --> 23:45.090
{\an8}At this point, I'm about to hit
every (bleep) in this house

23:45.157 --> 23:47.726
{\an8}until someone tells me who
the (bleep) moved my (bleep).

23:47.793 --> 23:48.960
Better get your ass
downstairs

23:49.027 --> 23:51.096
before I (bleep)
drag your ass downstairs!

23:51.163 --> 23:52.297
{\an1}Hold on!
I'm wiping my ass!

23:52.364 --> 23:54.132
{\an5}I just gotta wipe
my ass real quick!

23:54.199 --> 23:56.568
I'm taking a (bleep)!

23:56.635 --> 23:57.803
Okay, hold on!

23:57.869 --> 23:59.271
Can I wipe
my (bleep) ass?

23:59.337 --> 24:01.072
Wipe your ass, bitch!

24:01.139 --> 24:02.707
Okay!
(bleep)!

24:02.774 --> 24:04.209
{\an5}(Gus)
Are we about to confess
to this (bleep)

24:04.276 --> 24:05.577
or are we about
to ride it out?

24:05.644 --> 24:06.945
We don't know what the
(bleep) happened, dude.

24:07.012 --> 24:07.779
{\an1}I'm gonna say, I didn't see...
What do you want to do?

24:07.846 --> 24:09.014
I didn't see (bleep).

24:09.080 --> 24:10.282
What the (bleep)
are you talking about?

24:10.348 --> 24:11.149
{\an1}I didn't see (bleep) either.
I don't know what...

24:11.216 --> 24:12.417
I don't know what happened.

24:12.484 --> 24:13.852
Take that (bleep)
to the grave, (bleep).

24:13.919 --> 24:17.155
{\an1}Are you (bleep) trying to start
(bleep) with me and Nilsa?

24:17.222 --> 24:18.390
I'm just taking a (bleep).

24:18.456 --> 24:19.591
{\an1}'Cause I'm (bleep)
getting ready

24:19.658 --> 24:21.326
to knock someone
the (bleep) out!

24:21.393 --> 24:22.727
I'm up here,
taking a (bleep).

24:22.794 --> 24:25.030
{\an5}Is that okay?

24:22.794 --> 24:25.030
Who took my stuff
out of the room?

24:25.096 --> 24:27.365
{\an8}If you look at our track record,
I am thinking

24:27.432 --> 24:28.466
{\an8}this isn't gonna end well.

24:28.533 --> 24:29.768
{\an1}You pulled me
to the side and said

24:29.835 --> 24:32.037
{\an1}she moved my (bleep)
out of my goddamn room.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.104
{\an1}Did you (bleep)
not do that?

24:33.171 --> 24:34.306
I didn't say she moved it.

24:34.372 --> 24:36.074
I said somebody
moved that (bleep).

24:36.141 --> 24:37.475
{\an5}No, you said she did.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.475
Kortni! Kortni!

24:37.542 --> 24:38.977
I said somebody moved it.

24:39.044 --> 24:41.012
Everyone
shut the (bleep) up!

24:41.079 --> 24:42.948
Where's your (bleep) at?

24:43.014 --> 24:45.884
Day one, (bleep), all right?
You feel me?

24:45.951 --> 24:48.186
Oh, you want angry Kortni?
You see an angry Kortni.

24:48.253 --> 24:49.921
You've seen Kortni angry,

24:49.988 --> 24:52.023
but you ain't seen me
angry at you, bitch!

24:52.090 --> 24:54.726
You want to move (bleep),
I'll (bleep) with your (bleep).

24:54.793 --> 24:56.394
(overlapping shouting)

24:56.461 --> 24:58.296
{\an1}Uh-uh, you're not gonna start
throwing my (bleep).

24:58.363 --> 25:00.699
Hell to the (bleep) no.

25:00.765 --> 25:02.634
{\an8}It was almost like slow-mo,
just seeing white pants.

25:02.701 --> 25:05.604
(slow-motion audio)

25:05.670 --> 25:06.671
Codi's face was like...

25:06.738 --> 25:08.707
(slow-motion audio)

25:08.773 --> 25:11.309
Boom! And he got lit up.
(laughs)

25:11.376 --> 25:14.379
If you ruin my goddamn white
pants, then it's (bleep) on!

25:14.446 --> 25:15.881
I know that, (bleep)!
If you ruin

25:15.947 --> 25:17.883
my white goddamn
pants, it's (bleep) on!

25:17.949 --> 25:19.351
Those are white pants.
I brought them

25:19.417 --> 25:21.152
so I could wear
them after Easter.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.221
Not about to make me break
a fashion rule.

25:23.288 --> 25:24.522
(overlapping shouting)

25:24.589 --> 25:27.025
Whoever put their hands
on my (bleep), better...

25:27.092 --> 25:28.493
{\an3}Hell, no!

25:28.560 --> 25:29.761
Whoever put my (bleep)...

25:29.828 --> 25:34.199
(overlapping shouting)

25:34.266 --> 25:35.433
Bitch!

25:35.500 --> 25:36.868
(Jeremiah)
Right now I'm thinking that

25:36.935 --> 25:38.403
Kortni's about to kill Codi.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.739
Codi likes to stir the pot
a lot, so he's getting

25:40.805 --> 25:43.808
some pretty good
Southern justice right now.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.143
{\an1}Kortni!

25:45.210 --> 25:48.113
Who took my (bleep)
out of the room?

25:48.179 --> 25:49.281
Not me.

25:49.347 --> 25:51.216
Is Codi the one
that switched it?

25:51.283 --> 25:52.717
Are you asking a question?

25:52.784 --> 25:54.219
{\an5}Yes, I am asking you guys.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.219
I don't know what happened.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.954
But didn't you say you
wanted her room, anyways?

25:56.021 --> 25:58.189
{\an5}I did want her room.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.189
So, did you move it?

25:58.256 --> 25:59.257
No, I did not.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.458
You know what?

26:00.525 --> 26:01.993
This (bleep) is crazy!

26:02.060 --> 26:04.663
This (bleep) weighs
more than I do.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.298
I would not
move all my (bleep)

26:06.364 --> 26:07.866
that I moved
into my bedroom

26:07.933 --> 26:09.367
into Kortni's bedroom.

26:09.434 --> 26:10.602
Who moved it?

26:10.669 --> 26:12.470
Uh... not me.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.139
Whoever laid their hands
on my (bleep)

26:14.205 --> 26:15.974
will get their (bleep)
thrown.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.509
Everybody, calm down.

26:17.575 --> 26:18.810
{\an5}(Kortni)
Someone's gonna admit
to this (bleep)

26:18.877 --> 26:20.211
or someone's gonna get
(bleep) hit.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.615
Uhh!
Ow!

26:23.682 --> 26:26.318
Check that wall out and see
what I'll do to a (bleep).

26:27.719 --> 26:29.587
{\an5}(Gus)
We've been here
four or five hours

26:29.654 --> 26:32.424
and Kortni's punching walls.
She's going crazy.

26:32.490 --> 26:34.659
No one touches
my goddamn (bleep).

26:34.726 --> 26:36.428
Whoo-hoo, it's gonna be
a long summer.

26:36.494 --> 26:37.762
♪♪

26:41.833 --> 26:43.635
Who took my (bleep)
out of the room?

26:43.702 --> 26:45.337
Uhh!
Ow!

26:45.403 --> 26:48.473
Check that wall out and see
what I'll do to a (bleep).

26:48.540 --> 26:50.775
Everybody just calm down.
It's (bleep).

26:50.842 --> 26:52.610
We can move it back.
Let's just move it back.

26:52.677 --> 26:55.280
Oh, my God! Bitch, I will
lay him the (bleep) out.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.616
Kortni, you not finna lay
nobody else. Chill out!

26:58.683 --> 27:00.919
It's not that... No,
it's not that serious!

27:00.986 --> 27:02.554
{\an3}Let it go!

27:02.620 --> 27:04.055
(Candace)
Kortni is going crazy.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.891
She's ready to fight Codi,
she's ready to fight Nilsa.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.928
I think she's ready to
fight everybody.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.197
{\an8}Kortni's not good
with first nights.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.199
My (bleep), bitch.

27:12.263 --> 27:14.199
{\an3}Listen.

27:14.265 --> 27:16.101
You're lucky I did not burn
your goddamn (bleep), bitch.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.569
{\an5}I understand.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.569
You want to touch my (bleep)

27:17.635 --> 27:19.204
{\an1}and Nilsa's (bleep)
and then

27:19.270 --> 27:20.472
{\an4}you want to
sit there and say...

27:19.270 --> 27:20.472
They're trying to be funny.

27:20.538 --> 27:22.941
You know they're
trying to be funny.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.477
{\an8}Girl, calm down.
Girl, bye.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.379
I don't give a (bleep)!
Don't touch my (bleep)!

27:27.445 --> 27:29.481
{\an5}Listen, what you have,
(bleep), Kortni, it's
there. You can't do that.

27:29.547 --> 27:31.082
{\an1}We're gonna
have a good night.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.517
Oh, I'll have a great
night if it means me

27:32.584 --> 27:33.852
knocking Codi
the (bleep)...

27:33.918 --> 27:35.887
{\an1}Listen, your first night
last year wasn't that great.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.222
{\an1}We gonna have
a good first night.

27:37.288 --> 27:38.990
(Candace)
It's the first night.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.292
{\an8}We have a long summer
ahead of us.

27:41.359 --> 27:44.095
{\an8}I want Kortni to be here
and experience this with me

27:44.162 --> 27:45.597
{\an8}and with
everybody in the house.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.699
{\an1}All right,
so we're mad about

27:47.766 --> 27:49.534
{\an1}someone moving
someone's (bleep).

27:49.601 --> 27:51.770
{\an5}That's what we're mad about?

27:49.601 --> 27:51.770
That's my point.

27:51.836 --> 27:52.937
Over petty (bleep).

27:53.004 --> 27:54.172
Like, the (bleep)
got moved back.

27:54.239 --> 27:55.940
What's the big (bleep) deal?

27:56.007 --> 27:57.575
'Cause you guys knew
what it was gonna do,

27:57.642 --> 27:58.910
that's the problem.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.378
Jeremiah, don't do
this (bleep), please.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.113
No, don't you (bleep)
get at me.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.681
Get the (bleep) out of here.

28:03.748 --> 28:05.550
{\an1}Please don't start
this (bleep).

28:05.617 --> 28:07.819
{\an5}(Kirk)
Once Jeremiah gets going
with his dad talks, you know,

28:07.886 --> 28:09.320
{\an8}it's like, all right,
get it out. I'm sitting here,

28:09.387 --> 28:12.991
{\an8}it's like, 30 more seconds.
Okay, you done? You good?

28:13.058 --> 28:14.459
{\an8}All right, bud.
(laughs)

28:14.526 --> 28:16.227
You don't think you
pushed it too far?

28:16.294 --> 28:18.463
{\an1}(bleep) Kortni's banging her
hand into a (bleep) wall.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.731
{\an1}That's her fault.
That's not our fault.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.232
She's about to
fight Nilsa outside

28:21.299 --> 28:23.068
{\an5}while both of you
are upstairs.

28:21.299 --> 28:23.068
That's her fault.

28:23.134 --> 28:26.237
Okay. So, nobody's to blame
other than Kortni, correct?

28:26.304 --> 28:28.907
{\an5}No.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.907
{\an1}Okay, are you just completely
against pranks in general?

28:28.973 --> 28:30.341
{\an1}Is that
where your stance is?

28:30.408 --> 28:32.977
You want to do a prank,
sure, go ahead, go for it,

28:33.044 --> 28:34.846
but don't touch
other people's (bleep).

28:34.913 --> 28:37.248
Oh, so serious.
I'm so serious.

28:37.315 --> 28:39.117
{\an1}I'm Jeremiah.
I like protein.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.185
{\an5}I'm so serious.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.185
The right way.

28:40.251 --> 28:41.953
{\an5}The right way.

28:40.251 --> 28:41.953
Yeah. Ruh-ruh-ruh.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.822
Especially if somebody's
willing to fight

28:43.888 --> 28:46.591
{\an1}after somebody moved my
(bleep), yeah, yeah, I would.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.593
Oh, (bleep), God.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.261
{\an1}(Codi)
(bleep) Jeremiah's bitch ass.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.896
(Gus)
It's a joke, bro. Live.

28:51.963 --> 28:54.032
{\an5}Everything doesn't
have to be so uptight
all the time.

28:54.099 --> 28:55.667
{\an1}I guess...
I guess we must live

28:55.733 --> 28:57.635
{\an1}in a no-fun-zone house
this summer.

28:57.702 --> 29:00.371
{\an1}Who's laughing? 'Cause I've
still got a (bleep) left hand

29:00.438 --> 29:02.373
that's ready to (bleep) rock.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.641
Are you still mad?

29:03.708 --> 29:05.176
Yeah, she's mad.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.911
{\an1}But they moved it back,
I thought.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.480
I don't give a (bleep).

29:08.546 --> 29:12.750
It's a bag, people.
It's not that serious.

29:12.817 --> 29:15.120
{\an1}It was a prank.
It all got moved back.

29:15.186 --> 29:16.821
What's the (bleep) big deal?

29:16.888 --> 29:18.123
All right, you know what?

29:18.189 --> 29:21.025
Next time, it's not
gonna be a goddamn wall.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.827
It's gonna be
someone's (bleep) face.

29:22.894 --> 29:24.262
So don't (bleep) with me.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.764

{\an8}at this point, to be honest.

38:44.689 --> 38:45.856
(Jeremiah)
It's the end of the night.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.258
Everybody is trashed.

38:47.324 --> 38:48.526
We're all just
slurring our words,

38:48.592 --> 38:49.660
finding our way to the taxi.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.295
{\an8}It's like we're just
wobbling there.

38:51.362 --> 38:55.566
Turn that down.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.334
I'm gonna take a nap.

38:57.401 --> 38:59.670
{\an1}Get up!

38:59.737 --> 39:01.806
Give me your (bleep) hands.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.277
{\an8}(Kirk)
Kortni's hamburger.
We're ready to leave.

39:06.343 --> 39:07.645
{\an8}She's over here,
falling everywhere.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.280
{\an8}I'm trying to pick
her long ass up. It's hard,

39:09.346 --> 39:13.317
{\an8}'cause I'm a short dude
and she's like 6'8" barefoot.

39:13.384 --> 39:14.585
{\an3}(groans)

39:16.420 --> 39:17.922
{\an8}Kortni, are you okay?

39:17.988 --> 39:19.156
{\an8}She's straight.

39:19.223 --> 39:22.126
{\an8}She's just drunk as (bleep).

39:40.077 --> 39:42.613
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
Kirk is teasing Kortni
in her drunk stupor,

39:42.680 --> 39:46.717
when I notice Kortni's
boyfriend, and he looks pissed.

39:46.784 --> 39:50.020
{\an1}Kortni, chill the (bleep) out!
What are you doing?

39:50.087 --> 39:52.356
You're looking stupid.
Chill out.

39:52.423 --> 39:53.891
I don't give a (bleep)
what you're talking about.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.626
You're my girl.
I got my face on you.

39:55.693 --> 39:56.894
You need to stop
acting a fool.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.162
All right, no, for a fact...

39:58.229 --> 40:00.364
Hey, bro, I don't
give a (bleep).

40:00.431 --> 40:01.866
Kortni, chill out.

40:01.932 --> 40:04.602
You want to be with me, you
ain't gonna act like that.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.074
Oh, my God!
What the (bleep)?

40:10.141 --> 40:11.976
(Kortni)
The end of the evening is hazy,

40:12.042 --> 40:13.778
{\an8}but I was so pissed.

40:13.844 --> 40:15.780
Man, (bleep) that (bleep).

40:15.846 --> 40:17.014
{\an5}What happened?

40:15.846 --> 40:17.014
Ask her boyfriend.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.215
We don't (bleep) know him.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.517
{\an1}No, then I'm getting
the (bleep) out.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.585
Chill, chill! Kortni!

40:21.652 --> 40:23.020
{\an5}No, Kortni!

40:21.652 --> 40:23.020
Where's she going?

40:23.087 --> 40:25.256
{\an1}Oh, she's going to
beat this (bleep) guy.

40:25.322 --> 40:28.559
{\an5}(Codi)
Logan's upset
because Kortni's drunk,

40:28.626 --> 40:30.361
{\an8}and I don't know why he's
upset because I'm sure

40:30.427 --> 40:32.429
{\an8}when they go out,
this happens all the time.

40:32.496 --> 40:34.231
{\an7}Kortni, stop!
What are you doing?

40:34.298 --> 40:36.700
{\an8}Kortni! Kortni,
what are you doing?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.102
{\an8}Oh, my gosh,
here we go again.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.970
{\an8}Kortni, what are you doing?

40:40.037 --> 40:41.539
{\an8}Better stop or I'll
(bleep) you up, bitch!

40:41.605 --> 40:43.040
{\an8}Kortni, stop!

40:43.107 --> 40:44.341
{\an8}Kortni, we're going home.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.341
{\an8}Kortni, what are you doing?

40:44.408 --> 40:46.443
{\an8}Stop it. Kortni,
who are you trying to find?

40:46.510 --> 40:48.646
{\an8}Who? Tell me, who?

40:46.510 --> 40:48.646
{\an7}I'm trying
to see my boyfriend.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.481
{\an8}Your boyfriend? You want
to fight your boyfriend?

40:50.548 --> 40:51.782
{\an8}Do you want to get arrested?

40:51.849 --> 40:53.150
{\an8}Do you want to do
that (bleep)?

40:51.849 --> 40:53.150
{\an7}Yeah!

40:53.217 --> 40:56.821
{\an8}No, you not!

40:53.217 --> 40:56.821
{\an8}Kortni, get in the car.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.088
{\an8}Get in the car.

40:56.887 --> 40:58.088
{\an8}No!

40:58.155 --> 41:00.357
{\an8}Stop, Kortni!

40:58.155 --> 41:00.357
{\an8}Kortni, don't (bleep) do that!

41:00.424 --> 41:02.259
{\an8}Don't do that!
Don't (bleep)...

41:02.326 --> 41:05.129
{\an8}I'm like, oh, my God.
I've missed y'all so much.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.531
{\an8}I've missed y'all so much.
I need this right now.

41:07.598 --> 41:09.233
{\an8}Don't do that, Kortni!

41:07.598 --> 41:09.233
{\an8}I'll fight you!

41:09.300 --> 41:10.835
{\an8}I'll fight you!
