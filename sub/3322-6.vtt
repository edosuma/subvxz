WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:03.083
<i>(IF I HAD A HEART PLAYING)</i>

00:52.320 --> 00:54.971
Tell me what it is you want.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.882
Are you unhappy?

00:58.480 --> 01:00.289
Do you think the gods
have cheated you?

01:08.800 --> 01:11.246
I want my old
position back.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.001
I was never meant
to be a servant,

01:15.080 --> 01:17.003
a slave, a friend.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.205
I am bitter
and I am angry.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.170
Everything I had,
everything I possessed,

01:25.240 --> 01:27.607
everything that
I was

01:27.680 --> 01:29.045
has been stripped
away from me.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.088
And my anger is
like a stone...

01:41.000 --> 01:45.085
A stone that I carry
inside me that...

01:45.160 --> 01:46.207
Weighs me down.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.765
I cannot lift it.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.405
In some ways,
you are still fortunate.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.004
Ragnar could
have had you killed

01:56.080 --> 01:57.605
at the same time
as your husband.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.725
I am supposed to be eternally
grateful to my husband's killer?

02:02.520 --> 02:04.966
I ask you once more
why you have come here

02:05.680 --> 02:08.047
if you do not think I can
offer you any comfort.

02:10.039 --> 02:11.610
I want to know,

02:15.040 --> 02:18.487
will the gods ever
smile on me again?

02:19.840 --> 02:23.322
The gods will always
smile on brave women,

02:23.920 --> 02:26.446
like the Valkyries,

02:26.560 --> 02:31.088
those furies who
men fear and desire.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.280
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

03:24.120 --> 03:27.169
You'll have to forgive
the poverty of the feast.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.801
It has been a hard winter.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.769
We had to burn
our own grain stores

03:32.840 --> 03:34.649
to rid ourselves
of Jarl Borg.

03:34.760 --> 03:36.489
So I heard.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.604
Tell us, Erlendur,

03:40.680 --> 03:43.604
what happened in
England after we left?

03:47.120 --> 03:48.849
We were betrayed
by King Ecbert.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.646
We made contact and

03:51.200 --> 03:54.761
your Christian friend Athelstan arranged
for further talks, or so he said.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.726
In retrospect, I wonder
who's side he was really on.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.004
In any case,
the trickster was at work.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.482
Ecbert never meant to
honor his promises to you.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.166
We were betrayed,
taken by surprise.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.288
There was
a great slaughter.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.931
Erlendur and I barely
escaped with our lives.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.684
What about Athelstan?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.490
Where is he now?

04:18.560 --> 04:20.403
If he is fortunate,
he died in battle.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.241
In any case,
let's not speak of him.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.686
He was a
worthless individual.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.200
Poor Athelstan.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.726
My sister and I grew to love
him when we were children.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.209
FLOKI: He fooled you,
young Bjorn.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.881
He never denounced his
Christian God.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.882
He was our enemy.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.970
We should rejoice
at his death.

04:49.240 --> 04:54.280
So... What do you
intend on doing now?

04:54.960 --> 04:57.804
What do you think, Ragnar?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.884
I intend on gaining
revenge on King Ecbert.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.409
We should plan a raid
as soon as possible.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.802
ROLLO: I would be very
happy to take part in it.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.244
King Ecbert should
certainly be punished.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.688
I agree.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.125
We should return
to Wessex.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.646
But first, Jarl Borg
must pay the price

05:19.720 --> 05:23.167
for what he did to my
family and to our people.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.481
(GASPS)

05:29.280 --> 05:30.327
Forgive me, master.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.410
No, it doesn't matter.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.526
HORIK: I understand,
completely,

05:35.600 --> 05:37.682
and if I were you,
I would feel the same way.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.606
But we must remember our
agreement and what it was for.

05:42.480 --> 05:48.601
We would sail west to raid and to colonize.
That was your dream, Ragnar,

05:49.760 --> 05:52.127
and I have come
to share it.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.281
But now we have neither
the men nor the ships

05:56.360 --> 05:58.442
to realize our dreams.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.360
What are you saying?

06:01.440 --> 06:04.011
I think we should
go back to Jarl Borg.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.924
He is licking his wounds. He is
no longer as strong as he was.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.085
And, yet, we need him.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.369
We cannot go west
without his ships.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.204
And so, once again,

06:16.280 --> 06:19.011
we should ask him
to join our alliance.

06:24.440 --> 06:28.365
Don't listen to him.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.886
But who should
go to Jarl Borg?

06:30.960 --> 06:34.009
I think it should
be you, Rollo.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.926
After all, you know
him better than anyone.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.966
What do you think?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.204
Farewell, my love.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.403
I will pray to Thor that
he grant you safe passage.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.720
MAN: Throw that.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.847
May you have success, Rollo,
for the sake of all of us.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.725
MAN: Man your stations.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.165
MAN 2: Stores aboard.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.123
MAN 3: All the men aboard!

07:16.200 --> 07:18.407
Rollo.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.130
MAN: Try the sail then.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.406
I, too, wish you well.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.447
Those words mean
a lot coming from you.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.681
They were hard to say.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.251
Now they are said.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.046
Cast away!

07:37.120 --> 07:38.451
MAN: Ready the oars!

08:06.600 --> 08:10.207
It has an unusual
taste, wine.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.090
But then, you're
an unusual woman, Siggy.

08:16.760 --> 08:17.966
You don't like wine?

08:18.920 --> 08:19.921
It's horrible.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.242
The finer things in life
are an acquired taste.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.488
I hope you do not mind I
brought my son with me?

08:27.080 --> 08:30.721
I want him to start to
understand the game.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.727
The game?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.450
The game you and I play.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.811
The game Ragnar
tries to play.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.763
Are you sure
it is a game?

08:45.760 --> 08:48.286
Why do you invite
me to your bed?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.606
Why do you tell me
things about Ragnar?

08:57.640 --> 09:01.611
Everything I do,
I do for Rollo.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.284
And not for yourself?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.088
If Rollo rises,
I rise also.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.845
And you need my help.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.041
(CHUCKLING)

09:14.800 --> 09:16.325
Well, what do you think,

09:17.440 --> 09:18.441
King Horik?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.922
And what would you do,
Sissy,

09:23.160 --> 09:25.527
for my continued
and active support?

09:28.720 --> 09:29.721
(LAUGHING)

09:29.920 --> 09:32.241
My son is ignorant
of the game

09:32.320 --> 09:36.530
and strangely ignorant
of other things as well.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.570
He's only been with a few
women, and they were nothing...

09:39.680 --> 09:41.682
Slaves, girls.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.167
I want him to
enjoy the attentions

09:48.240 --> 09:52.086
of an experienced,
free woman.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.361
(EXHALING)

10:29.120 --> 10:32.203
Erlendur, come.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.282
SIGVARD: <i>She sees a hall
more fair than the sun,</i>

11:26.360 --> 11:29.045
<i>thatched with gold, at Gimle.</i>

11:29.120 --> 11:32.522
<i>There shall the gods
in innocence dwell,</i>

11:33.160 --> 11:35.970
and live forever
a life of bliss.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.121
(BURPING)

11:38.520 --> 11:40.522
Why don't we have poets
here anymore?

11:42.600 --> 11:45.001
Poets to entertain us.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.963
Sing to us.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.202
Make us laugh.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.282
I remember when this great hall
was always full of laughter.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.969
Laughter and good
fellowship.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.125
WOMAN: You can see
it in her eyes.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.846
My wife has
returned to me.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.081
(CHUCKLING)

12:07.160 --> 12:08.889
That's good.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.491
(SCATTERED LAUGHTER)

12:10.680 --> 12:13.763
She went without
my permission.

12:13.840 --> 12:18.004
But, as you can all see, she has
come back, and I love her for it.

12:19.280 --> 12:24.161
After all, what man
wouldn't be pleased

12:25.280 --> 12:27.726
at the return
of such a wife?

12:31.320 --> 12:32.321
<i>Skal.</i>

12:32.680 --> 12:34.170
ALL: <i>Skal!</i>

12:36.880 --> 12:39.326
<i>Skal</i>, husband.

12:48.680 --> 12:53.527
Unfortunately, you left
my stepson behind.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.651
MAN: It's time to leave.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.724
Gerta, take my hand.
Come. Come.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.727
He wanted to stay
with his father.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.610
He's old enough to decide.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.609
Is it not enough
that I came back?

13:12.720 --> 13:16.725
No, it's not enough,
my dear wife,

13:16.800 --> 13:18.768
it's... It's not enough.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.724
Of course it's not enough.
It's an insult to me.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.371
What else could
I have done?

13:24.440 --> 13:26.408
His father is
Ragnar Lothbrok.

13:31.880 --> 13:36.010
Who is this
Ragnar Lothbrok?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.641
Nothing but a windbag,
an opportunist.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.961
A man so bloated
with self-importance

13:42.040 --> 13:45.169
he pretends to be
descended from Odin!

13:45.240 --> 13:46.287
(ALL LAUGHING)

13:47.920 --> 13:49.649
He doesn't need to
pretend anything.

13:57.080 --> 14:01.802
Now I know for sure why
you went to defend him.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.646
Not to repulse a foreign
invader, as you lied to me,

14:06.960 --> 14:09.804
but because you're still
in love with him.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.765
You're still in love
with Ragnar Lothbrok,

14:18.160 --> 14:21.164
aren't you, wife?

14:28.440 --> 14:31.250
You can sleep
alone tonight.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.130
I have made
other arrangements.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.007
(DOOR CREAKING)

(FOOTSTEPS)

15:00.640 --> 15:01.766
(ALL GRUNTING)

15:25.960 --> 15:28.531
Master, can I help you?

15:29.280 --> 15:32.602
I was going to ask
you the same question.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.011
Those buckets
look very heavy.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.330
I'm used to it.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.121
What is your name?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.526
Porunn.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.965
Sit a moment.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.330
I have to finish my work.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.004
It is all right.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.247
Where do you sleep?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.606
In that barn

16:15.200 --> 16:18.124
with the other
servants and animals.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.881
Do you...have a boyfriend?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.290
Of course!

16:33.040 --> 16:35.088
I must finish my work.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.086
ASLAUG: She is
remarkably good looking.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.044
If you say so.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.246
Why do you let Horik
decide everything?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.800
Can you really
forgive Jarl Borg?

17:14.440 --> 17:17.683
Do you know how much I
suffered because of him?

17:17.760 --> 17:19.842
How much your
son suffered?

17:22.119 --> 17:25.965
Yes, I know.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.287
But you do
nothing about it!

17:29.200 --> 17:30.884
By insulting and
humiliating me,

17:30.960 --> 17:34.442
he insulted and
humiliated you.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.326
My father never would
have allowed such a thing.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.641
He would have
been revenged.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.842
Your father cannot
do too much now,

17:46.960 --> 17:48.530
being dead.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.001
What is wrong?

18:18.520 --> 18:19.760
You are quite safe.

18:23.920 --> 18:24.921
Where is he?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.210
Sit down.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.281
What is that?

19:11.160 --> 19:14.607
The skull of my first wife.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.569
She continues to advise me.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.641
Is that fair to her?

19:25.600 --> 19:30.640
So... Your brother wants me
to come and fight for him?

19:32.080 --> 19:35.004
He wants to rebuild
the original alliance

19:35.080 --> 19:36.605
between himself,
King Horik, and you.

19:39.520 --> 19:45.209
He believes that,
in our small countries,

19:45.280 --> 19:47.760
cooperation is
the only way forward.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.207
So, he does not
want revenge upon me?

19:53.280 --> 19:55.760
After all,
I invaded his lands.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.850
Men like you and I will
always look for revenge.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.725
Ragnar looks beyond.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.762
Then he is a most
extraordinary man indeed.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.207
As forgiving
as a Christian!

20:12.960 --> 20:15.770
He is also
a practical man.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.650
He and King Horik
have lost a lot of men.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.404
They need you to
help them raid.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.322
BORG: What do
you say, my love?

20:39.160 --> 20:40.161
(SNIFFING)

20:44.680 --> 20:47.490
You think I should go?

20:52.640 --> 20:54.927
She thinks I should go.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.845
Torvi, bring some mead.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.481
Yes, Jarl Borg.

21:00.560 --> 21:04.690
You and I must drink to this

22:10.920 --> 22:14.641
I believe it is a...
A divine gift.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.322
Thank you, sire.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.920
I thought I might
have forgotten, but...

22:22.640 --> 22:24.927
I love these materials.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.086
Brushes, the paints,
the colors.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.570
I had not appreciated
how much I missed my work.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.723
The pagans have
nothing like it?

22:36.800 --> 22:41.328
No. They have no art.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.129
They can neither
read nor write,

22:43.200 --> 22:45.646
except for their
carved runes.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.767
Hmm.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.926
And their gods?

22:51.000 --> 22:55.881
Uh, Odin and Thor and Freyr.
(CHUCKLING)

22:55.960 --> 22:58.406

must have found them.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.331
In some ways, yes.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.681
In other ways...

23:06.160 --> 23:07.571
In other ways?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.651
Their gods are very old.

23:13.720 --> 23:16.405
And sometimes I could not help
noticing some similarities

23:16.480 --> 23:19.086
with our own God,
and his son.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.564
For example,
their god, Odin,

23:22.640 --> 23:25.405
whom they call the All-father,
the god of gods,

23:26.280 --> 23:28.442
wanted to discover
what it was like to die.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.085
So, according to their
stories and traditions,

23:32.160 --> 23:34.083
Odin hung himself
from a tree

23:35.360 --> 23:38.330
and a pagan servant stabbed
him in his side with a spear,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.809
just like the Romans
did to Christ.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.845
Come with me.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.401
Tell me honestly.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.441
What do you
think of these works?

24:01.840 --> 24:04.923
I find them indescribably
beautiful.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.843
But they are
clearly pagan.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.161
(LAUGHING)

24:11.960 --> 24:13.371
You are only a monk,
Athelstan,

24:13.440 --> 24:17.490
and yet, somehow,
I begin to trust you.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.364
I feel you...

24:20.720 --> 24:23.451
You are a kindred spirit.

24:27.400 --> 24:32.361
Who? Who painted
these images?

24:32.680 --> 24:35.923
What race of man
was ever so glorious

24:36.000 --> 24:38.287
that they filled
our world with such,

24:38.840 --> 24:42.242
as you say,
indescribable beauty?

24:44.280 --> 24:46.806
I have been told, sire,

24:46.920 --> 24:47.967
that you served
at the court

24:48.040 --> 24:50.202
of the emperor
Charlemagne,

24:50.280 --> 24:52.886
which I have
also visited.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.325
I cannot imagine,
therefore,

24:54.400 --> 24:58.200
that you do not
know what I know.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.851
That these images were
painted by the Romans.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.082
They conquered these
lands a long time ago.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.924
They conquered
the whole world.

25:06.760 --> 25:10.765
But they were pagans.
They worshipped false gods.

25:14.400 --> 25:18.962
Never speak of our conversation
to any other man here.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.850
Nobody else would
understand it.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.251
They would fear it.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.444

an interpretation

25:26.520 --> 25:29.569

once lived here.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.122
And that we have
nothing to do with them.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.042
The fact is, Athelstan,

25:39.840 --> 25:43.925
we have lost more knowledge
than we ever had!

25:45.760 --> 25:49.731
These Romans knew things
that we will never know.

25:49.800 --> 25:53.805
Their pagan gods allowed
them to rule the world.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.610

we can learn from that?

44:48.800 --> 44:49.961
LOTHBROK: lam sorry,

44:51.760 --> 44:56.766
that the ambiance of
Kattegat has awoken you.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.200
What is the cause of this?

44:59.920 --> 45:00.921
MAN: In here!

45:14.680 --> 45:17.809
HORIK: Is he dead?
FLOKI: No, no, no.

45:17.920 --> 45:21.288
He's not dead... Yet.

45:21.880 --> 45:22.881
(GRUNTING)

45:30.080 --> 45:31.491
Why have you done this?

45:31.880 --> 45:34.281
Did you really think that I
could ever forgive this man

45:35.400 --> 45:38.370
for threatening
to kill my family?

45:39.360 --> 45:40.600
So, what will you do now?

45:52.680 --> 45:54.682
Since you consort
with eagles,

45:55.600 --> 45:58.809
I will draw a blood eagle
on your back.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.761
No.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.807
And your ribcage

46:05.880 --> 46:07.689
will spring apart.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.691
No.

46:20.080 --> 46:21.445
Yes.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.690
Like wings.
