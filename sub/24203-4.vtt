You think Dennis
is a homosexual?

06:51.111 --> 06:53.080
He's very fond of roses.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.216
PENELOPE: He's a gardener.
Of course he's fond of roses.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.630
Of course not.

07:11.732 --> 07:15.235
We haven't been intimate
for some time.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.281
No more than usual.

07:28.315 --> 07:32.252
It's just sometimes
very hard, Paul.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.155
A woman of my standing to be...

07:35.188 --> 07:37.791
in permanent competition.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.760
PAUL:
With whom, my dear?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.762
PENELOPE:
You know perfectly well, Paul.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.565
It's not seemly, it's...

07:44.598 --> 07:47.968
it's humiliating.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.137
There is no competition.

07:53.140 --> 07:57.077
Spending the night
with a woman is easy.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.313
And I do like sexual variety.

08:00.347 --> 08:04.151
But with whom does one
spend the day?

08:04.184 --> 08:07.454
The long, long day.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.922
Now that...

08:08.956 --> 08:12.092

15:28.061 --> 15:29.196
No, but I'm telling you.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.697
What color are his eyes?

15:30.730 --> 15:33.433
How many fillings
does he have in his teeth?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.902
He has a scar on his leg, where?
If you have him,

15:35.935 --> 15:38.138
then you'll know something
that nobody else does.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.739

ROBINA:
To whom it may concern,

19:17.557 --> 19:19.926
Thank you for your letter
to John Paul Getty,

19:19.959 --> 19:21.828
and for explaining
your situation.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.931
With regards
to your request for money,

19:24.964 --> 19:28.768
Mr. Getty is a businessman,
not a charity.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.871
He therefore regrets
he is unable to help you now

19:31.904 --> 19:34.274

Penelope.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.005

20:39.038 --> 20:42.342
We do not entertain you
as we did?

20:42.375 --> 20:45.144
I have a life

it seems.

-He neglects to say.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.266
Golly, is that a ransom demand?

21:07.300 --> 21:09.336

time in the future" letters.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.362
Oh, come on.
For his own grandson?

21:35.395 --> 21:36.629
He wouldn't.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.234
Well, yeah, he would.

21:42.268 --> 21:46.806
Ugh. Is it just me
or are those eggs off?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.277
Wow.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.312
I guess he missed
the press conference.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.614

21:54.647 --> 21:56.349
$17 million.

21:56.383 --> 21:58.585

What?

21:58.618 --> 22:00.753

if you've been kidnapped.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.755
A considerable amount
if you haven't.

A river, some trees.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.264

24:36.876 --> 24:39.411

Oh, oh, oh!

Fuck!

25:06.005 --> 25:08.174
Hey, it was just for the fish.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.152
Not bad.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.156
The fish.

25:24.190 --> 25:27.359
-It's good.
-Mm.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.298
Hey, uh, how much
are you asking?

25:32.331 --> 25:35.067
For ransom.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.803
I don't know.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.170
You don't know?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.840
I'm just a translator.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.542
They don't involve me
in that stuff.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.684
Lira?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.352
Dollars.

25:53.385 --> 25:57.023
Shit. No. No.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.025
Your grandfather
is a billionaire, come on.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.093
Yeah, but he's the meanest
fucker in the world.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.529
He has a payphone in his house.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.369
A payphone.
It doesn't matter. The point is

26:10.402 --> 26:13.706
he's a billionaire and he won't
even pay for a phone call.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.875
(scoffs)
He won't give you that much.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.910
You have to know that.
I'm not lying.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.753
Eh, eh...

26:31.924 --> 26:34.360
Uh...

26:34.393 --> 26:36.763
I don't know what I'm worth.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.791
-Uh...
-(line beeping)

27:12.464 --> 27:14.466
(dogs barking in distance)

27:20.306 --> 27:22.742
Yes? Problem?

27:22.775 --> 27:25.778
I... I just came
to see how you are.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.614
-I'm fine.
-It's just that I saw.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.917
The other day.
The dogs.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.585
-It was unpleasant.
-Ah.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.621
Bloody animals.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.623
Yeah, I'm sore, if I'm honest.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.460
Got a nasty bite.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.830
Entertained the women
of the house, though.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.397
Yes.

27:45.431 --> 27:48.300
Well, they do like
their blood sports, don't they?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.476
Follow me.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.807
-What a place.
-My little hideout.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.409
It's where I come
for a bit of R and R.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.945
It's not against regs
or anything, but, um...

28:32.979 --> 28:34.446
Well, you know
how it is around here.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.616
Probably best
to keep schtum. Beer?

28:37.649 --> 28:40.319
Oh... well, I, um...

28:40.352 --> 28:43.655
I-I don't, actually...
very rarely.

28:43.689 --> 28:46.025
And I-I need
to make sure that I...

28:47.693 --> 28:49.528
Why not?

28:49.561 --> 28:51.563
(speaking Italian)

28:56.702 --> 28:58.771
(sniffs)

28:58.805 --> 29:00.773
-That's good?
-Yeah.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.041
(speaks Italian)

29:02.074 --> 29:03.375
-Si, man, it's good.
-(chuckles)

29:03.409 --> 29:06.078
-Thank you.
-(speaks Italian)

29:07.914 --> 29:10.082

29:16.055 --> 29:17.556
ANGELO: Tell us a story
about yourself.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.391
-A story.
-PAUL III: A story?

29:19.425 --> 29:21.060
About me?

29:21.093 --> 29:23.896
Perfetto. Perfetto.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.898
PAUL III:
All right.

29:25.932 --> 29:29.701
DENNIS: I hear on the grapevine
that you're a bit of a rose man.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.871
But...

29:31.904 --> 29:34.606
how well do you know
this little lot?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.712
What do you see?

29:43.115 --> 29:45.584
Clematis, narcissus,

29:45.617 --> 29:48.087
cyclamen, oleander.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.056
Well, I know them,
obviously, but...

29:50.089 --> 29:52.859
what do I see?

29:52.892 --> 29:54.726
Well, if a chap like you
can't see it,

29:54.760 --> 29:57.129
it's probably not there.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.268
What am I looking for?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.938
Ah, well, they might
have something in common.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.775
And then again, they might not.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.952
Bullimore is foxed.

30:19.986 --> 30:23.122
Bullimore don't like it.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.960
PAUL III:
There was Jojo the Dog.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.096
(translating Italian)

30:30.129 --> 30:31.797
Uh, Jojo.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.632
-Jojo.
-Jojo.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.302
Jojo was really scared
of heights.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.606
Really scared. Yeah?

30:40.639 --> 30:44.143
And, uh, Harry the Horse...

30:45.144 --> 30:47.113
...told him to jump.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.981
(imitates horse sputtering)

30:49.015 --> 30:52.718
Said to him, "Jump, Jojo. Jump."

30:54.186 --> 30:56.155
But Jojo was...

30:56.188 --> 30:59.791
was so scared, he...

30:59.825 --> 31:01.460
he didn't want to do it,
you know?

31:01.493 --> 31:04.430
H-He... he was scared
that if he jumped,

31:04.463 --> 31:06.032
he'd be all alone.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.005
Harry the Horse said to him,

31:13.039 --> 31:16.342
"Listen, Jojo...

31:16.375 --> 31:18.644
-"if you believe...
-(translating in Italian)

31:18.677 --> 31:21.013
...anything is possible."

31:21.047 --> 31:22.982
That's right, yeah.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.251
But Jojo the Dog,

31:25.284 --> 31:29.021
he walked to the edge
of the cliff,

31:29.055 --> 31:31.023
and he said...

31:34.560 --> 31:36.862
"Can I?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.830
Can I?"

31:38.864 --> 31:40.366
Can he?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.268
Can he jump?

31:42.301 --> 31:45.004
Yeah? Yeah?

31:45.037 --> 31:46.973
Yeah?

31:47.006 --> 31:48.207

Just a moment, Gail.

Robina, please.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.811
This is important.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.180
I'll let him know you called.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.583
You let him know,

as you're standing
right next to him,
