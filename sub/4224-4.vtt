18:24.040 --> 18:26.646
Then I'm in your hands, completely.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.210
You hold all the cards.

18:31.560 --> 18:35.451
But, I hope to God that
my dismissal doesn't come

18:35.520 --> 18:38.763
before your decision to
hand back those guns.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.482
And I say this for your sake because,

18:43.080 --> 18:46.562
if I were to be fired,
and it were your fault,

18:49.080 --> 18:51.321
I would do things that
would shame the devil.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.367
<i>(caucus)</i>

18:53.920 --> 18:56.366
My fury is a thing to behold.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.680
On my last day in power, for example,

19:01.680 --> 19:02.966
I would see to it

19:04.040 --> 19:07.886
that you and your scum brothers have
your heads stoved in with mallets

19:08.160 --> 19:09.321
and spades.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.010
And your sister, too.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.409
That baby inside her would
be of no consequence to me.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.602
The only one to be spared

19:21.640 --> 19:23.608
would be your little brother Finn.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.842
He would, however, be lifted,
as a juvenile,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.570
and dumped in that part
of the adult prison

19:32.680 --> 19:36.571
where men have the most
appetite for boys like him.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.647
Oh, that would be
a dark day indeed, Mr Shelby,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.163
if my dismissal comes
before your decision.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.521
You understand?

19:51.040 --> 19:52.530
And know this,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.684
the clock is ticking.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.361
(SNIFF5)

20:29.800 --> 20:31.325
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

20:43.000 --> 20:44.604
(GRUNTING)

20:45.520 --> 20:47.329
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

20:51.560 --> 20:55.042
(MORE SHOUTING)

20:57.480 --> 20:58.845
(YELLING IN PAIN)

21:03.880 --> 21:05.530
Look what we found.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.925
Seems Stanley Chapman really
does have snow on his boots.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.605
Come on. Here we go.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.130
Mr Chapman...

21:22.760 --> 21:24.250
You're fucked.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.321
(DOOR OPENS)

21:38.840 --> 21:42.367
He still refuses to say
where it came from.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.443
I'm sure with a little persuasion

21:47.240 --> 21:48.890
he'll tell us everything he knows.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.129
Including the whereabouts
of Freddie Thorne.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.651
- Sir?
- Your face is a picture.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.885
But I thought you'd done a deal.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.490
- Oh, is that what you thought?
- Well, you gave your word.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.969
My word.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.202
People still talk about such
things in this idiotic century.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.011
My word to who?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.730
To a Peaky Blinder?

22:19.440 --> 22:23.240
Now, go on and interrogate
Mr Chapman until he tells

22:23.320 --> 22:26.130
us where we can find
Freddie Thorne and his wife.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.767
The source of the money
is of secondary importance.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.843
You think my campaign against
Shelby has become personal?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.161
Correct.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.445
Spot on, as they say in London society.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.843
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.686
And do not make the mistake
of being too gentle.

22:51.480 --> 22:52.686
Right, sir.

23:24.760 --> 23:25.921
Today's her birthday.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.200
I know you never miss it.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.964
Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.161
- What do you want?
- Came to warn you.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.725
They've lifted Stanley Chapman.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.525
How do you know?
Police don't spill that information.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.643
I know because it was me and Tommy
who tipped him off.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.647
Tommy did a deal.
In return for safe passage

23:48.800 --> 23:50.802
for you and Ada,
he's given them Stanley and the money.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.000
Money? What money?

23:56.920 --> 23:59.048
- Who told you about the money?
- Who do you think?

24:01.360 --> 24:02.885
Yeah, it was Ada's idea.

24:03.560 --> 24:06.370
That's how desperate she is to get out
of that rat hole you're keeping her in.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.371
She didn't mind if you knew, just didn't
want to be here when you found out.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.964
Sometimes women have to take over.
Like in the war.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.849
Who the hell do you think you are?
You fucking Shelbys!

24:17.920 --> 24:19.570
Don't you swear over
your mother's grave.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.086
You play your tune, you expect
the whole world to dance to it.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.730
You don't have time for this, Freddie.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.725
You did a dealfor me.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.481
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.403
And you think this copper
will keep his word?

24:35.600 --> 24:38.570
If he does, you're safe.
If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.729
You'll still have to leave
town, same result.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.409
- So neat.
- So leave.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.489
Except there's one thing that
you've got wrong,

24:47.320 --> 24:50.449
Stanley won't be able to give up my
address because he doesn't know it.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.842
That's how it works.
None of us know each other's addresses.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.361
So you've wasted your fucking time.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.606
And they'll keep beating him and beating
him for information he doesn't have.

25:03.880 --> 25:07.362
So all you've done is sign the
death warrant of a good man.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.450
- So you won't leave?
- No, I won't fucking leave.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.767
And if you want me out of Birmingham,
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.330
You lay a hand on our Ada and I'll
put you in a wooden box myself.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.806
You raised a stubborn one there, Irene.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.324
You told me to carry on.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.004
I wanted to stop.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.648
He had some kind of seizure.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.002
(SIGHS) So you killed him.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.641
Did he give you an address?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.731
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.928
This is not bloody Belfast.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.602
Not yet, but if men like him
get their way, it soon will be.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.408
So find some stairs, throw him
down, and call the coroner.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.366
Use Grayson.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.010
If he has any awkward questions,

26:43.160 --> 26:45.970
ask about the welfare of his mistress
in Saltley.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.610
That'll shut him up.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.800
To think I used to live
in a shithole like this.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.845
Bloody animals.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.730
The Shelbys really are doing
an excellentjob for us.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.566
We haven't lost a single penny to

27:04.640 --> 27:06.881
rafflers or chalkers
in eight race meetings.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.686
The bookies are purring.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.968
So we throw the dog a bone.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.201
I think so.

27:19.600 --> 27:23.082
Mr Kimber, Mr Roberts,
come and have a look around.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.001
After you.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.488
(IN DISTINCT CHATTER)

27:41.240 --> 27:43.163
Well, I thought the Lees
turned you over?

27:43.240 --> 27:45.641
You shouldn't listen to gossip,
Mr Kimber. This way.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.046
Business is good.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.850
Especially since now you know

27:52.920 --> 27:55.127
which horse is going to win
before you set the odds.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.961
Information is very much appreciated.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.243
All right, well, where are they?

28:03.200 --> 28:05.771
John, Lovelock. Scudboat, in here.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.331
This is my team.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.526
They will take up their pitch at your
convenience, Mr Kimber.

28:16.840 --> 28:20.049
John is the book, Scudboat is the
bag man, and of course,

28:20.280 --> 28:21.930
we bring our own protection.

28:24.440 --> 28:29.128
Warwick, next Saturday,
at least 50 yards from the beer tent.

28:55.560 --> 28:59.042
Gentleman, and lady.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.484
I have in my hand

29:02.880 --> 29:07.044
a legal betting license,
issued by the Board of Control.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.969
The Shelby family has its first, legal

29:13.480 --> 29:14.720
racetrack pitch.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.803
(ALL CHEERING)

29:24.640 --> 29:25.721
Congratulations.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.161
There you go.

29:28.680 --> 29:29.841
Congratulations.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.165
30, 40, 50...

29:40.680 --> 29:42.728
These cigarettes
have a strange smell, Arthur.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.881
They smell like rotting water.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.207
And look,

29:47.280 --> 29:48.725
rats have got into some of them.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.447
They're stolen, are they not?

29:51.560 --> 29:52.641
Don't ask.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.085
They smell because you
keep them in the boat.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.607
What do you care? Now, can you
come check my adding up, please?

30:04.200 --> 30:06.487
You know, you should make a
new start of this place.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.041
Do it propeflY-

30:08.440 --> 30:10.169
These cigarettes are not fit to sell.

30:10.760 --> 30:11.921
Smells like Gallipoli.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.327
You should find a new
place to store them.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.681
It has to be far away from coppers.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.171
Oh, but not rats.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.487
All the wharves have rats, Grace.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.924
What's wrong with a dry warehouse?

30:24.200 --> 30:25.326
Tommy's orders.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.566
What orders?

30:28.960 --> 30:32.282
Always keep contraband near
petrol boat moorings.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.211
Don't boats get searched?

30:34.280 --> 30:35.884
We moor them at junctions.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.850
So there's more than one way out.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.050
No locks within a mile
so we can move that stuff,

30:42.520 --> 30:43.601
fast.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.929
Your brother doesn't obey the law,
but he has rules.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.050
Precise man, your brother.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.366
I5 m)! adding up right?

30:50.480 --> 30:51.606
It is now.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.321
CAMPBELL: One.

30:55.720 --> 30:56.801
Two.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.087
Three.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.085
<i>And four.</i>

31:00.520 --> 31:02.807
<i>And we'll search them one-by-one.</i>

31:09.240 --> 31:13.450
Please, Lord, let that which
I seek be found here.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.248
Not so much as a bullet, sir.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.203
Just more cigarettes and whisky.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.562
Arthur tells me you've
been asking questions.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.010
About how we run our business

31:50.080 --> 31:51.411
and how we get our booze

31:51.720 --> 31:52.721
and where we keep it.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.286
I'm just trying to help.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.805
Let's you and me go for a walk.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.486
Where to?

32:01.560 --> 32:02.721
Come on.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.326
Why here?

32:16.000 --> 32:18.002
You're a good Catholic girl, aren't you?

32:20.280 --> 32:21.281
Yes.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.240
Well, then you know it's here
people come to confess.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.164
(SIGHS) After you.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.165
Well, here it is, Grace.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.406
I'll confess.

32:45.640 --> 32:46.721
I need someone.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.766
Kimber has an adviser by
the name of Roberts.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.246
He talks well.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.130
Keeps the accounts.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.649
Runs the legal side of the business.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.086
And you need a Roberts?

33:01.680 --> 33:03.170
Arthur tells me you have ideas.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.564
I'm not an accountant, nor a lawyer.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.721
No.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.489
No, but you have something I need.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.961
Class.

33:14.080 --> 33:16.447
I need someone who looks
right at the big meetings.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.365
Epsom, Ascot.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.771
Is this a job interview?

33:19.840 --> 33:21.330
Arthur says you're good with numbers.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.404
(LAUGHS) Oh, well, that's relative.
He's quite poor.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.481
(SCOFFS)

33:25.800 --> 33:27.245
You keep the books in order.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.560
They were chaotic.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.891
But you're a liar.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.564
No Catholic girl would enter a church

33:38.640 --> 33:40.404
and forget to make
the sign of the cross.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.007
You're very perceptive.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.924
First, you lied to me about that
pub you used to work in.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.563
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.404
- Do you care?
- No.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.731
I like to fit in.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.326
You pull a pint

33:59.640 --> 34:01.085
like someone who's thinking about it.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.089
This is not an interview,
this is an interrogation.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.161
Sit down.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.926
Look, Grace.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.806
(SIGHS)

34:13.880 --> 34:15.609
You've washed up in a
place you don't belong,

34:16.440 --> 34:17.440
for whatever reason.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.360
My good fortune.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.719
And perhaps mine.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.929
You know that most of
what I do is illegal?

34:30.719 --> 34:31.846
I'm not blind.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.449
And yet you'd still be
willing to work for me?

34:37.400 --> 34:38.969
Are you offering me the job?

34:39.760 --> 34:40.761
(SCOFFS)

34:43.560 --> 34:44.561
Then I accept.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.925
There's something else you should know.

34:50.159 --> 34:53.083
A very important detail about
my reasons for employing you.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.406
You disappoint me.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.610
- Yeah.
- Good,

36:00.720 --> 36:02.085
because John's got four of them.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.491
It's all right, I'm not going
to try to talk you out of it.

36:23.640 --> 36:24.766
I just want to talk.

36:25.680 --> 36:26.681
Then you're against us?

36:27.680 --> 36:29.170
John is his own man.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.526
And you're your own woman.

Now, Lizzie,

36:37.920 --> 36:41.242
since I came back from France,
I've come to you on many occasions.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.605
Tommy, you didn't tell him?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.366
No, I didn't tell him.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.204
Just like you didn't tell him.

Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

Why didn't you tell him

36:55.120 --> 36:57.930
that you've been serving
his brother for the past two years?

36:59.640 --> 37:01.005
Because the past is the past.

I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.683
That was the answer I was hoping
you'd give. The past is the past.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.647

He wants me to be
his bookkeeper and secretary.

you're dealing with, here.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.127
I've tried stopping her but
she's been drinking.

She's been stuck in that little basement

Oh, Christ, Tommy, please.

own brother-in-law!

Yeah, beautiful, really smooth.

Your sister's in there giving birth,
