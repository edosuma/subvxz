00:01.047 --> 00:05.766
_

00:06.528 --> 00:07.628
It just made sense

00:08.177 --> 00:10.696
to move in
to my grandmother's house.

00:11.628 --> 00:12.979
She wanted to re-create
for our daughter

00:13.029 --> 00:14.988
the happy memories
she had in this house.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.537
I was stunned to see Amelia
sitting up in bed.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.073
Who is she talking to?

00:23.139 --> 00:24.811
I know I heard somebody,

00:24.861 --> 00:26.547
but there's nobody there.

00:28.932 --> 00:29.966
Something was wrong
in our house.

00:37.107 --> 00:40.828
I could feel awful,
searing hatred.

00:40.878 --> 00:42.812
Who's there?

00:44.114 --> 00:46.567
Something paranormal
was in our house,

00:46.617 --> 00:50.404
but I never would have thought
a member of my own family

00:50.454 --> 00:52.539
would be trying to harm me.

00:52.589 --> 00:54.241
Chris! Chris!
She's back!

_

01:06.929 --> 01:11.083
_

01:14.278 --> 01:16.170
I grew up in a small city

01:17.514 --> 01:20.591
about 20 minutes east of L.A.
called Whittier.

01:21.758 --> 01:25.045
I spent a lot of my time
with my grandmother.

01:25.095 --> 01:27.113
She lived
down the street from us.

01:27.163 --> 01:28.215
Hi, grandma.

01:28.265 --> 01:30.650
I'd come in,
and she'd say...

01:30.700 --> 01:32.752
How are you, sugar pie?

01:32.802 --> 01:34.221
What you up to?

01:34.271 --> 01:36.056
Not much.

01:36.106 --> 01:37.390
Ooh, what are we making today?

01:37.440 --> 01:38.774
Your favorite pie.

01:43.615 --> 01:45.734
I loved my grandmother dearly.

01:45.784 --> 01:49.971
She was wonderful to me,

01:50.021 --> 01:52.107
very caring and nurturing...

01:52.157 --> 01:54.443
- Hey.
- Very warm...

01:54.493 --> 01:58.246
And loving and inviting.

01:58.296 --> 01:59.247
What do you think?

02:01.733 --> 02:04.019
Sorry, grandma.
Got to go.

02:04.069 --> 02:06.188
Don't you want some pie?

02:06.238 --> 02:09.591
I met Chris in July of 2008.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.294
Chris loved life.

02:12.344 --> 02:16.865
He had no fear about him
and such strong confidence.

02:16.915 --> 02:18.382
Bye, grandma!

02:22.921 --> 02:24.039
The common cliche...

02:24.089 --> 02:26.041
It was just love at first sight.

02:26.091 --> 02:28.692
The minute I laid eyes on her,
I knew she was the one.

02:31.596 --> 02:35.799
Chris and I got very serious
very quickly.

02:40.438 --> 02:44.392
But my happiness was cut short.

02:47.946 --> 02:50.447
My grandma had a stroke.

02:53.018 --> 02:56.071
And our family decided
that she needed

02:56.121 --> 02:58.073
round-the-clock care
that we couldn't provide,

02:58.123 --> 03:02.426
so she had to go
to a hospice facility.

03:04.229 --> 03:06.515
Chris and I spent
as much time as we could

03:06.565 --> 03:10.000
visiting her and trying
to keep her spirits up.

03:11.570 --> 03:13.288
What can I do for you,
grandma?

03:13.338 --> 03:18.242
There was a day that she was
really down and depressed.

03:20.245 --> 03:22.831
And she asked
for her favorite blanket.

03:22.881 --> 03:25.066
The one grandpa got me...

03:25.116 --> 03:28.036
It's on my bed.

03:28.086 --> 03:30.872
I'll go, babe.
You stay with grandma.

03:30.922 --> 03:33.008
Before Chris left,
I told him...

03:33.058 --> 03:34.309
Just go in
through the back door.

03:34.359 --> 03:35.644
It's always open.

03:35.694 --> 03:39.881
Chris works security,
so he gave me a puzzled look.

03:39.931 --> 03:42.384
And I said,
"she comes from the generation

03:42.434 --> 03:44.686
"where you leave your doors
and your windows

03:44.736 --> 03:46.303
unlocked and open."

03:48.000 --> 03:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.780 --> 03:58.549
Sure enough, the door was open
like they said.

04:05.991 --> 04:08.510
It was a creepy, dark house.

04:10.762 --> 04:12.781
And there's all kind of antiques
and sort

04:12.831 --> 04:14.282
that she had collected
over the years.

04:25.243 --> 04:27.662
Damn it.

04:31.983 --> 04:35.370
All of a sudden, I got
this really strange feeling,

04:35.420 --> 04:37.354
almost like
somebody's following me.

04:44.763 --> 04:47.148
I don't see anything,
so I shrug it off and think,

04:47.198 --> 04:50.251
"it's just my imagination.
Snap out of it."

05:01.379 --> 05:03.698
I go into her bedroom...

05:06.885 --> 05:09.638
And see her blanket
sitting there.

05:13.558 --> 05:16.111
I still feel
this heaviness about me.

05:20.832 --> 05:22.217
I'm a big guy.

05:22.267 --> 05:24.853
I've been in the security field
for about nine, ten years,

05:24.903 --> 05:27.689
so there's not too many things
that are gonna creep me out,

05:27.739 --> 05:29.391
but this house
had me creeped out.

05:33.745 --> 05:35.130
When I got back to the hospital,

05:35.180 --> 05:38.199
I guess obviously I looked like
something was bothering me.

05:38.249 --> 05:39.634
What's the matter?
What happened?

05:39.684 --> 05:41.002
Nothing.
I don't know.

05:41.052 --> 05:43.138
It just seemed like
there was somebody in the house.

05:43.188 --> 05:44.506
But obviously,
there was nobody there.

05:44.556 --> 05:47.375
Mr. Security.

05:47.425 --> 05:51.212
I thought Chris was
just reading too much into it.

05:51.262 --> 05:53.197
You're my hero.

06:05.043 --> 06:07.495
My grandmother passed away.

06:07.545 --> 06:10.799
I was completely devastated.

06:10.849 --> 06:16.104
This was someone who I had spent
so much of my life with,

06:16.154 --> 06:18.840
someone who raised me,

06:18.890 --> 06:23.393
and my best friend,
and now she's gone.

06:34.806 --> 06:37.007
Chris and I got married.

06:41.412 --> 06:43.364
We had a baby girl,

06:43.414 --> 06:45.649
and we named her Amelia.

06:49.921 --> 06:51.506
It just made sense for us

06:51.556 --> 06:54.858
to move in
to my grandmother's old house.

06:57.595 --> 06:58.880
The price was right.

06:58.930 --> 07:01.149
The house was a perfect size.

07:01.199 --> 07:03.151
It had a backyard.

07:03.201 --> 07:05.820
It was everything
we were looking for

07:05.870 --> 07:08.223
and an added bonus to me to be

07:08.273 --> 07:10.992
in the warmth and the comfort
of my grandmother's home.

07:16.981 --> 07:20.317
I knew it would have made
my grandma so happy.

07:22.053 --> 07:27.509
It made me feel closer
to my grandmother,

07:27.559 --> 07:31.336
almost as if still a part of her
was with me.

07:47.219 --> 07:49.271
There was a lot
of unpacking to do,

07:49.321 --> 07:53.075
getting rid of old stuff
that was in the house.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.244
Wait.

07:55.294 --> 07:57.613
It's my guardian angel.

07:57.663 --> 07:58.881
We didn't get to all of it.

07:58.931 --> 08:00.883
We just kind of took
a couple of boxes of paperwork,

08:00.933 --> 08:02.284
shoved them in the den closet.

08:02.334 --> 08:03.935
It's nothing
that's that important.

08:08.007 --> 08:11.293
We hung pictures
in our hallway of family:

08:11.343 --> 08:15.280
His family, my family,
past generations.

08:18.183 --> 08:21.537
Mementos of, like, people
that had passed on or...

08:21.587 --> 08:24.306
That we can see every time
we walk through the hallway.

08:24.356 --> 08:25.975
- Well?
- It looks great.

08:26.025 --> 08:27.142
See what your man did for you?

08:31.363 --> 08:32.715
"Rocky, I'm afraid this joke

08:32.765 --> 08:34.817
may get Zeke
in a whole mess of trouble."

08:34.866 --> 08:36.333
Amelia had her own room.

08:36.892 --> 08:37.601
"Rocky laughed.

08:37.650 --> 08:42.342
I'll just put this rock on a sheet.
It was amazing to think that my daughter

08:42.393 --> 08:44.679
was the third generation
of my family

08:44.729 --> 08:46.280
to live in this house.

08:47.765 --> 08:49.083
"To find his first crowd
of customers."

08:49.133 --> 08:51.552
It gave me
such a warm feeling.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.588
"They're going to expect
a ghost.

08:53.638 --> 08:56.357
Zeke hasn't got anything
but a rock and an old board."

08:56.407 --> 08:58.708
"They'll just run him
over to jail."

09:00.311 --> 09:03.798
It brought back memories
of me when I was a little girl

09:03.848 --> 09:05.733
with my grandmother
in the house.

09:05.783 --> 09:07.135
"After all,
it was his mischief

09:07.185 --> 09:09.386
that started
all this foolishness."

09:18.463 --> 09:21.649
A few days later,
we had put Amelia to bed.

09:21.699 --> 09:25.019
And welcome
to Fact or Fiction.

09:25.069 --> 09:27.989
- I'm your host...
- I glanced over at the monitor.

09:28.039 --> 09:31.759
And I was stunned
to see Amelia sitting up in bed.

09:31.809 --> 09:33.928
Welcome to our champion,
bunny.

09:41.552 --> 09:46.030
She was having a conversation
with someone.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.299
It's my daddy.

09:48.349 --> 09:50.168
As you know,
bunny has won...

09:50.218 --> 09:53.838
$17,380 dollars so far.

09:53.888 --> 09:55.339
Chris.

09:55.389 --> 09:58.476
Look at this.

10:00.661 --> 10:01.846
Who is she talking to?

10:01.896 --> 10:03.848
She was looking
in a specific direction

10:03.898 --> 10:06.184
as if somebody was sitting there
next to the bed

10:06.234 --> 10:08.186
that she was talking to.

10:08.236 --> 10:10.688
Here's our child
sitting up in bed

10:10.738 --> 10:13.858
having a full conversation...

10:13.908 --> 10:15.693
With nothing.

10:15.743 --> 10:17.795
And then I hear
another voice...

10:20.014 --> 10:24.268
Almost like a really faint...
But you could hear it...

10:24.318 --> 10:25.369
Woman's voice.

10:34.262 --> 10:36.013
And I'm kind of like
weirded out,

10:36.063 --> 10:38.049
like, "what's... what the hell's
going on in here?"

10:38.099 --> 10:40.051
Like, "am I just...
Am I hearing things?"

10:40.101 --> 10:41.552
Who is that?

10:41.602 --> 10:43.387
I start to freak out
and, like, wonder,

10:43.437 --> 10:44.555
"who's... who's in her room?

10:44.605 --> 10:45.756
Did somebody break in?"

10:59.447 --> 11:01.133
I go over, and I start
checking the windows

11:01.183 --> 11:03.651
to make sure that they're locked
and make sure nobody's in there.

11:10.725 --> 11:12.778
Who you talking to,
sweetie?

11:12.828 --> 11:16.348
To my friend.

11:16.398 --> 11:19.918
Who's your friend?

11:19.968 --> 11:22.487
She shut down,
didn't want to talk about it.

11:22.537 --> 11:27.541
For her to want to keep a secret
was very unusual.

11:29.311 --> 11:30.845
Okay.

11:42.991 --> 11:44.376
I didn't know what to think.

11:44.426 --> 11:48.146
But I started to watch
the monitor like a hawk.

11:49.764 --> 11:50.715
Good night.

11:50.765 --> 11:52.199
Good night.

12:07.716 --> 12:10.302
One night,
Chris had gone to work.

12:10.352 --> 12:13.605
I went to take my contacts out,
get ready for bed.

12:24.566 --> 12:28.520
I heard a very small,
very light knock

12:28.570 --> 12:31.690
on the bathroom door.

12:31.740 --> 12:33.358
I thought,

12:33.408 --> 12:34.359
"meh."

12:34.409 --> 12:35.861
Tried to brush it off.

12:43.752 --> 12:48.206
It sounded like a fist
had pounded the door...

12:48.256 --> 12:50.308
Very forceful bang,

12:50.358 --> 12:51.292
very loud.

12:55.764 --> 12:59.451
I'm home alone
with my young child.

13:00.535 --> 13:01.869
I needed to check on her.

13:09.644 --> 13:12.313
I reached out,
kind of shaking.

13:26.394 --> 13:28.313
I felt blind.

13:28.363 --> 13:29.948
Everything was blurry.

13:32.734 --> 13:35.120
There was no one
outside the door.

13:48.116 --> 13:52.537
My daughter was looking very
happy and peaceful in her bed.

13:58.593 --> 14:02.080
I heard what sounded
like footsteps on the roof.

14:05.633 --> 14:07.986
The thing that really scared me

14:08.036 --> 14:12.557
was that somebody could be
trying to break into our house.

14:23.913 --> 14:28.746
_

14:30.717 --> 14:33.350
_

14:33.530 --> 14:35.999
What would anybody want
with us in our house?

14:37.052 --> 14:39.938
I called my husband immediately.

14:39.988 --> 14:43.141
I was talking
probably a mile a minute.

14:43.191 --> 14:46.011
- Come home right now.
- Okay.

14:46.061 --> 14:47.345
Look, I'll be home
as soon as I can.

14:47.395 --> 14:48.829
Just sit tight.

14:55.998 --> 14:57.983
When I get home,
I grab my flashlight.

14:58.033 --> 14:59.184
And it's so heavy,

14:59.234 --> 15:02.955
I can double it up as a weapon
if I need to.

15:03.005 --> 15:04.056
Stay here.

15:04.106 --> 15:05.873
I'm gonna go check outside.

15:13.173 --> 15:16.068
I walk down the run
behind our bedroom

15:16.118 --> 15:17.885
and don't see anything.

15:19.321 --> 15:22.908
It was dead quiet.

15:22.958 --> 15:24.543
But we're just east of L.A.,

15:24.593 --> 15:26.411
so there is always
that possibility

15:26.461 --> 15:30.249
that we could have a break-in
or anything of that nature.

15:32.801 --> 15:36.588
But there was nothing out there.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.423
So I kind of just said,
you know, "hey, honey,"

15:38.473 --> 15:41.260
and just reassured her.

15:41.310 --> 15:44.412
Maybe she's hearing new creaks
and cracks of an old house.

15:48.650 --> 15:49.584
Smooch!

15:52.321 --> 15:53.772
I wasn't sure what it was,

15:53.822 --> 15:57.342
but there was something
threatening about the house.

15:57.392 --> 16:00.212
This was not the safe place

16:00.262 --> 16:02.463
that I remembered
from my childhood.

16:10.606 --> 16:12.724
I decided we should maybe do
something as a family,

16:12.774 --> 16:15.209
so I thought, "okay,
let's have a barbecue out back."

16:20.282 --> 16:23.050
It was nice
to have family time again.

16:25.454 --> 16:27.573
Chris is working a lot,

16:27.623 --> 16:30.142
and it was wonderful
to have him home.

16:30.192 --> 16:34.079
And Amelia was having fun
playing with her toys.

16:34.129 --> 16:36.515
It seemed like
a perfect evening.

16:46.908 --> 16:47.859
Holy crap.

16:47.909 --> 16:49.428
What was that?
What?

16:49.478 --> 16:53.098
I saw this figure,
like a black, shadowy figure,

16:53.148 --> 16:56.101
like, pass by the kitchen,
and then it was gone.

16:56.151 --> 16:57.603
You didn't see that?

16:57.653 --> 17:01.206
His face got really serious.

17:01.256 --> 17:02.374
You guys stay there.

17:02.424 --> 17:06.011
I'm just gonna go inside
for a second.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.046
I went into my room and
grabbed my gun from the safe.

17:08.096 --> 17:09.664
I knew it was fully loaded.

17:12.768 --> 17:14.987
My heart's racing, 'cause,
you know, at any given moment,

17:15.037 --> 17:17.405
I can turn the corner
and kind of see somebody.

17:23.512 --> 17:25.396
Amelia, come here.

17:25.446 --> 17:26.547
Come on.

17:34.322 --> 17:36.724
I feel like somebody's
on my heels...

17:40.162 --> 17:41.629
Like a heavy weight on me.

17:49.137 --> 17:52.073
I had heard a creaking noise
coming from the kitchen.

17:55.811 --> 17:56.744
"What was that?"

18:14.096 --> 18:15.396
Who's there?

18:20.102 --> 18:22.888
I saw something,
at least a figure of somebody.

18:22.938 --> 18:25.390
I couldn't shake the feeling
there was somebody there.

18:27.109 --> 18:29.061
Is everything okay?

18:29.111 --> 18:31.363
Yeah, it's nothing.
I thought I saw something.

18:31.413 --> 18:33.398
But... it's nothing.

18:33.448 --> 18:35.233
I wasn't convinced.

18:35.283 --> 18:38.070
I know that
if he thinks he saw something

18:38.120 --> 18:41.339
and he went to investigate it,

18:41.389 --> 18:43.608
there's a reason behind it.

18:43.658 --> 18:46.178
He saw something,
and he just wasn't telling me.

18:48.930 --> 18:52.500
Later that evening,
Chris had gone to work.

19:04.246 --> 19:07.532
I was trying to just relax

19:07.582 --> 19:09.750
and finish up some housework.

19:24.599 --> 19:27.719
I hear tapping
on the window...

19:28.770 --> 19:31.005
As if fingernails were tapping.

19:39.347 --> 19:41.600
Nothing there,
absolutely nothing.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.747
I hear this scratching

19:55.797 --> 19:59.417
on the outside of the house.

20:05.607 --> 20:08.442
The hair on my arms stood up.

20:17.152 --> 20:21.222
It sounded like the living room
door slammed shut.

20:23.325 --> 20:26.961
I stood there really not wanting
to go see what it was.

20:41.276 --> 20:42.327
Another bang...

20:42.377 --> 20:43.628
The kitchen door...

20:43.678 --> 20:45.297
The den door...

20:45.347 --> 20:46.665
And then another...

20:46.715 --> 20:47.799
And another...

20:47.849 --> 20:49.100
And then another.

20:54.689 --> 20:56.141
They didn't actually close.

20:56.191 --> 20:58.276
They just made the noise.

21:03.632 --> 21:06.418
I felt so vulnerable.

21:10.705 --> 21:14.174
I had a terrible feeling
somebody was following me.

21:38.556 --> 21:41.374
_

21:41.535 --> 21:44.528
_

21:46.429 --> 21:49.898
I felt something
grip my shoulder.

21:54.237 --> 21:57.114
After what
I had just experienced,

21:59.009 --> 22:01.728
I knew something was happening.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.513
Something paranormal
was in our house.

22:06.383 --> 22:09.469
There's definitely something

22:09.519 --> 22:12.305
or someone
connected to this house.

22:24.534 --> 22:27.153
I was searching
for any kind of reason

22:27.203 --> 22:29.623
as to what was happening to us.

22:29.673 --> 22:31.658
I started to think,

22:31.708 --> 22:35.161
"could it be somehow connected
to my grandmother?"

22:35.211 --> 22:39.232
Available 3.6 liter v6
makes 295.

22:39.282 --> 22:41.668
In terms of fuel economy,
Chrysler's boasting up to...

22:41.718 --> 22:43.837
Is grandma still here?

22:43.887 --> 22:47.841
Maybe we had done something
to upset her.

22:47.891 --> 22:50.176
What do you mean "here"?

22:50.226 --> 22:52.912
This was her house
for so long.

22:54.397 --> 22:56.016
What the...

22:56.066 --> 22:57.117
Stay there.

23:04.941 --> 23:05.892
Amanda,

23:05.942 --> 23:07.443
you have to come see this.

23:13.249 --> 23:17.537
I couldn't believe
what I was looking at.

23:17.587 --> 23:20.140
This one picture
came off the wall

23:20.190 --> 23:25.011
and landed
in a very unnatural way.

23:25.061 --> 23:29.816
We were both completely
at a loss.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.484
The nail's still good.

23:31.534 --> 23:34.287
The picture would have
had to have been lifted off

23:34.337 --> 23:35.655
to come off the nail.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.090
I was utterly confused

23:37.140 --> 23:39.308
as to what was going on
and what was happening.

23:42.178 --> 23:43.329
I started to wonder,

23:43.379 --> 23:45.165
"maybe we should have moved
somewhere else.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.333
"Maybe we should have moved
somewhere to start fresh

23:47.383 --> 23:51.671
that neither one of us
had any memories from."

23:51.721 --> 23:53.273
Hey, Chris?

23:53.323 --> 23:54.990
Hey, Kevin.

23:59.496 --> 24:01.881
My boss asked me,
"hey, you know"...

24:01.931 --> 24:03.416
What's going on?

24:03.466 --> 24:04.684
I told him, you know,

24:04.734 --> 24:06.519
"I have some weird things
going on in the house,

24:06.569 --> 24:09.122
a lot of things
that I can't explain."

24:09.172 --> 24:10.423
Neither of us can.

24:10.473 --> 24:12.792
Like what?

24:12.842 --> 24:16.296
Like fingernails
scratching at the window,

24:16.346 --> 24:17.897
footsteps down the hall.

24:17.947 --> 24:18.998
And he said, you know,

24:19.048 --> 24:20.516
"well, maybe
I can help you with that."

24:22.352 --> 24:23.970
My wife, Lisa,

24:24.020 --> 24:25.972
she's a psychic.

24:26.022 --> 24:27.307
I was dumbfounded,

24:27.357 --> 24:29.809
'cause I didn't really
so much as buy into,

24:29.859 --> 24:33.862
you know, psychics and mediums
and things of that nature.

24:37.033 --> 24:41.421
Amanda, she's frightened.

24:41.471 --> 24:42.522
We were desperate
at this point.

24:42.572 --> 24:43.690
We didn't know what else to do,

24:43.740 --> 24:45.507
so we decided,
"let's give it a shot."

24:47.377 --> 24:48.310
Okay.

24:59.088 --> 25:01.441
I'm a psychic medium.

25:01.491 --> 25:04.110
I specialize in exorcisms
and cleansings.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.329
I've been gifted
since about four years of age.

25:08.498 --> 25:09.549
Hi, Amanda?

25:09.599 --> 25:10.784
I'm Lisa.

25:10.834 --> 25:13.319
I didn't know
what a psychic was

25:13.369 --> 25:16.122
except for the silly things
you see on TV,

25:16.172 --> 25:20.460
and I didn't really know
what to think,

25:20.510 --> 25:23.278
but I knew we needed something.

25:25.515 --> 25:27.844
They were
a very sweet young couple.

25:27.894 --> 25:31.047
I could tell immediately
they were very s

25:31.097 --> 25:32.081
they really needed help,

25:32.131 --> 25:33.749
and I really wanted
to help them.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.528
She moved through the house

25:45.578 --> 25:47.864
as if she was taking photographs
with her eyes

25:47.914 --> 25:49.848
and just kind of making
observations.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.911
As I walked around the home,

26:01.961 --> 26:05.982
a pulse in my hand
began to start.

26:06.032 --> 26:09.986
It got stronger and stronger,
and it was leading me around.

26:10.036 --> 26:13.656
I got this very strong sense
of history.

26:13.706 --> 26:16.492
Have you been living here
long?

26:16.542 --> 26:19.328
No, just a few months.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.497
Well, that's strange.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.882
I feel a very strong
family connection.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.339
This is my grandmother's house.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.108
It was really odd,

26:32.158 --> 26:34.292
because we hadn't given her
any information.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.331
I was heading
towards Amelia's room.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.855
My hand started having a pulse.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.025
It's like a Geiger counter.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.343
I was drawn to her little bed.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.734
And I pointed to a spot
on the ground.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.637
Does she talk to someone
there?

27:01.687 --> 27:03.639
I froze for a second.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.508
Yes.

27:05.558 --> 27:08.811
I remembered Amelia
sitting up in bed

27:08.861 --> 27:12.731
having a conversation
with someone we couldn't see.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.756
All of a sudden,
I could hear talking.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.161
I can hear her now.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.500
The presence
was in the room with us.

27:40.252 --> 27:41.830
_

27:41.887 --> 27:43.672
I could hear talking.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.909
I can hear her now.

27:51.563 --> 27:55.350
The presence
was in the room with us.

28:00.839 --> 28:03.358
She's very kind.

28:03.408 --> 28:04.793
"He said,
'I'll just put this'"...

28:04.843 --> 28:06.628
I like her presence.

28:06.678 --> 28:08.697
You could feel
this good presence,

28:08.747 --> 28:11.967
and it was a very gentle,
very kind, very nurturing voice.

28:14.853 --> 28:19.574
And then Lisa said
that the spirit in this room

28:19.624 --> 28:21.810
was a positive force.

28:21.860 --> 28:24.446
It was actually
protecting my daughter.

28:26.698 --> 28:28.750
"He thought and thought."

28:28.800 --> 28:33.352
When she turned
to leave the room,

28:33.402 --> 28:35.288
I heard Lisa say something.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.156
That started all this"...

28:37.206 --> 28:38.458
Sugar pie.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.308
Sugar pie.

28:41.878 --> 28:44.497
My heart stopped.

28:44.547 --> 28:46.114
What did you say?

28:50.720 --> 28:51.753
Sugar pie.

28:53.389 --> 28:56.776
I got very emotional.

28:56.826 --> 28:59.278
It's my grandma.

28:59.328 --> 29:02.915
That's what she called me.

29:02.965 --> 29:05.618
It was
a wonderful feeling inside

29:05.668 --> 29:11.773
to think that this woman
was now protecting my child.

29:13.009 --> 29:15.628
But it was very confusing.

29:15.678 --> 29:18.297
We had a guardian angel
presence,

29:18.347 --> 29:19.465
but on the other hand,

29:19.515 --> 29:22.984
these terrible things
had happened.

29:25.521 --> 29:27.155
The next room I went to
was the den.

29:29.025 --> 29:31.644
You could feel this dark,
horrible feeling.

29:31.694 --> 29:33.129
It was overwhelming.

29:38.457 --> 29:40.488
I was jolted and pushed back.

29:42.907 --> 29:46.093
I heard this very aggressive
voice yelling and screaming.

29:46.143 --> 29:48.029
Get out of here!

29:48.079 --> 29:49.864
Lisa.

29:49.914 --> 29:50.931
Stop.

29:50.981 --> 29:52.433
I could feel
that she was trapped.

29:52.483 --> 29:53.501
I could hear it.

29:53.551 --> 29:55.169
She's angry.

29:55.219 --> 29:57.104
Stop it!

29:57.154 --> 29:58.439
I could see her
dig her nails in

29:58.489 --> 30:00.941
and scratch and claw
at the side of a box.

30:02.460 --> 30:05.012
There's a box.
There's a box!

30:05.062 --> 30:06.914
She wanted out so desperately.

30:06.964 --> 30:08.816
She was literally in a hell.

30:08.866 --> 30:09.884
Lisa.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.585
Lisa!

30:11.635 --> 30:14.555
I looked at my hands,
and I swear they were bleeding.

30:17.007 --> 30:17.941
Scratching.

30:28.185 --> 30:30.805
She wanted me to feel the pain
that she was going through.

30:30.855 --> 30:33.307
What is going on?
Lisa.

30:33.357 --> 30:36.644
I could feel a presence

30:36.694 --> 30:39.814
literally physically there.

30:39.864 --> 30:43.150
Lisa turned around and said,

30:43.200 --> 30:45.502
"you have human remains here."

30:48.539 --> 30:50.324
Right behind my hand
on this wall,

30:50.374 --> 30:53.594
there's a box of human remains.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.429
In the closet.

30:55.479 --> 30:59.266
My jaw dropped.

30:59.316 --> 31:03.104
I couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

31:03.154 --> 31:04.605
I open up the closet door,

31:04.655 --> 31:07.290
and we have all sorts of boxes
stored in there.

31:10.995 --> 31:12.146
No.

31:12.196 --> 31:14.324
She tells me, "keep looking.
Keep going."

31:16.967 --> 31:17.934
No.

31:20.504 --> 31:21.789
It's that one,

31:21.839 --> 31:24.291
that one.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.608
It's in there.

31:28.345 --> 31:29.412
This is it.
It's in there.

31:37.188 --> 31:38.339
My God.

31:38.389 --> 31:39.807
As soon as Chris
took out the box,

31:39.857 --> 31:41.624
I realized what it was.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.280
Great-aunt Almarie.

31:46.330 --> 31:48.965
Almarie?
Who's that?

31:50.134 --> 31:53.903
Inside this box
was an urn of ashes.

31:59.643 --> 32:01.996
I looked over at my wife,
and she looked back at me,

32:02.046 --> 32:04.598
and, you know,
she understood.

32:04.648 --> 32:07.417
Like, she understood
what Lisa was talking about.

32:10.621 --> 32:14.023
Not everybody knew that
my grandma had a twin sister.

32:16.026 --> 32:18.379
She lived out in Las Vegas,

32:18.429 --> 32:23.284
so I only saw her
maybe once or twice a year.

32:23.334 --> 32:25.419
She had very long fingernails.

32:25.469 --> 32:27.188
Stop fidgeting.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.990
She was a very stern person,

32:30.040 --> 32:32.193
very difficult.

32:32.243 --> 32:35.162
Everything had to be her way
or no way.

32:35.212 --> 32:36.312
Take the picture.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.138
When my uncle passed away,

32:44.188 --> 32:47.141
my grandmother had to bring
her sister back home

32:47.191 --> 32:50.978
to take care of her there.

32:51.028 --> 32:52.479
The whole time she was there,

32:52.529 --> 32:55.249
she made my grandma miserable

32:55.299 --> 32:58.252
and would be very nasty.

32:58.302 --> 33:02.612
Homemade chicken soup.

33:02.662 --> 33:05.082
I don't want it. T so.

33:05.132 --> 33:08.118
I don't want it.

33:08.168 --> 33:10.754
It was very upsetting
seeing my grandmother

33:10.804 --> 33:13.690
being treated
in such a mean way.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.274
Get out of here!

33:18.645 --> 33:22.414
A few months after that,
my great-aunt passed away.

33:26.386 --> 33:28.972
I never would have thought
in a million years

33:29.022 --> 33:31.742
that a member of my own family

33:31.792 --> 33:35.094
would be trying to harm me.

33:44.838 --> 33:47.958
I tried to explain to them
the gravity of the situation.

33:48.008 --> 33:49.793
You need to get rid
of these ashes

33:49.843 --> 33:51.795
to protect this family.

33:51.845 --> 33:55.899
Her great-aunt blamed them
for her being in that box.

33:55.949 --> 33:59.069
She's just begging to be out,
and no one's listening,

33:59.119 --> 34:02.239
so her only recourse
is aggression.

34:02.289 --> 34:04.975
She'd do anything
to get out of that box,

34:05.025 --> 34:06.042
anything.

34:17.454 --> 34:18.701
What is going on?
Lisa.

34:19.656 --> 34:23.925
_

34:24.110 --> 34:26.898
I tried to explain to them
the gravity of the situation.

34:26.947 --> 34:28.900
You need to get rid
of these ashes

34:28.949 --> 34:30.382
to protect this family.

34:33.286 --> 34:36.889
Her great-aunt blamed them
for her being in that box.

34:41.629 --> 34:43.514
If these remains
were not removed,

34:43.563 --> 34:45.864
this family would never survive
living there.

34:55.576 --> 34:58.178
Me and Amanda had talked about
what to do with the ashes.

35:02.917 --> 35:04.068
I had figured that we'd just

35:04.118 --> 35:05.736
leave them
in the garage overnight,

35:05.786 --> 35:06.904
and then we would
just figure out

35:06.954 --> 35:08.154
what to do with them
in the morning.

35:14.095 --> 35:16.280
Ha-ha,
that's great, bunny.

35:16.330 --> 35:20.318
As you know,
bunny has won $17,380...

35:20.368 --> 35:23.220
Later that evening,
Chris had gone to work,

35:23.270 --> 35:25.823
and I was sitting on our bed
watching a little TV.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.158
Thank you.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.360
Bunny, are you ready
to meet that new challenger?

35:29.410 --> 35:30.761
Yeah, I really am.

35:30.811 --> 35:32.463
Okay, bunny.

35:35.149 --> 35:37.535
Let's bring in
that new mystery challenger.

35:38.619 --> 35:39.603
Well, hello.

35:39.653 --> 35:40.771
- Hi.
- And your name?

35:41.822 --> 35:43.341
- My name's Sable.
- Sable.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.575
Sable...

35:44.625 --> 35:49.246
I hear fingernails
tapping on our window.

35:49.296 --> 35:52.416
They were, "tap, tap, tap."

35:53.601 --> 35:54.785
Sable's from Harlem.

35:54.835 --> 35:57.054
Isn't that wonderful?

35:57.104 --> 35:58.522
I'm gonna get me some money.

35:59.774 --> 36:01.025
So you can get out of Harlem,

36:05.813 --> 36:09.233
And you can see
that she is very serious.

36:09.283 --> 36:11.802
All right, Sable,
you know how our game is played.

36:11.852 --> 36:13.437
Yes.
I watch it every day...

36:33.441 --> 36:35.393
And I looked out the window.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.543
Absolutely nothing.

36:47.922 --> 36:50.908
I was completely petrified.

36:54.061 --> 36:57.181
I knew that my great-aunt
was back.

36:58.332 --> 36:59.683
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

36:59.733 --> 37:01.252
And he's still saying
it's not him.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.420
Yeah, right.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.754
Yeah, I get him
back to the car...

37:03.804 --> 37:07.191
Come on. Come on.

37:09.743 --> 37:10.694
Hey, babe.

37:10.744 --> 37:12.596
Chris! Chris!
She's back!

37:12.646 --> 37:14.532
What?

37:14.582 --> 37:16.033
Chris, come home, please!

37:16.083 --> 37:17.201
Okay.

37:17.251 --> 37:18.636
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just...

37:20.421 --> 37:21.872
Amanda.

37:21.922 --> 37:23.140
Amanda.

37:23.190 --> 37:24.508
All of a sudden,
the phone drops call.

37:24.558 --> 37:28.279
Chris?

37:28.329 --> 37:29.680
And the phone went dead.

37:49.316 --> 37:51.836
I was terrified,

37:51.886 --> 37:53.571
completely terrified.

37:56.557 --> 38:01.161
I could feel the most evil,
terrible feeling.

38:05.966 --> 38:07.767
I hear this...

38:10.638 --> 38:11.989
The door had shut,

38:12.039 --> 38:14.007
almost as if somebody
closed it.

38:30.090 --> 38:31.876
No. Amelia!

38:31.926 --> 38:33.377
No!

38:35.596 --> 38:37.581
The door wouldn't open.

38:37.631 --> 38:39.049
Trying to pull on the door

38:39.099 --> 38:41.152
and hit the door
and kick the door.

38:52.213 --> 38:53.497
On the roof

38:53.547 --> 38:57.001
as if this spirit
was trying to cave in my roof.

39:01.055 --> 39:03.174
Mommy!
Mommy!

39:03.224 --> 39:04.508
No! Amelia!

39:06.127 --> 39:07.845
My daughter starts to cry,

39:07.895 --> 39:10.114
and I can't get out.

39:10.164 --> 39:11.148
I can't get to her.

39:11.198 --> 39:12.383
Mommy!

39:12.433 --> 39:13.400
No.

39:24.712 --> 39:26.264
Amelia!

39:26.314 --> 39:28.566
Mommy! Mommy!

39:28.616 --> 39:31.202
Amelia!

39:33.721 --> 39:35.706
Mommy!

39:35.756 --> 39:38.876
I hear
what sounds like footsteps.

39:41.562 --> 39:43.314
Mommy!

39:46.267 --> 39:49.754
Something was coming at me.

40:02.189 --> 40:08.155
_

40:08.214 --> 40:10.861
I hear what sounds
like footsteps.

40:11.987 --> 40:14.788
Something was coming at me.

40:24.532 --> 40:26.551
Quick, Amelia!

40:29.037 --> 40:31.089
I was petrified for Amelia.

40:36.344 --> 40:38.129
Mommy!
Mommy!

40:38.179 --> 40:40.498
Leave my daughter alone!

40:40.548 --> 40:42.334
Stop messing with my family!

40:42.384 --> 40:44.336
I'm just yelling
at the top of my lungs,

40:44.386 --> 40:46.471
"leave my family alone.

40:46.521 --> 40:47.872
If you want to pick
on somebody"...

40:47.922 --> 40:48.873
Pick on me!

40:48.923 --> 40:50.508
I'm right here!

40:50.558 --> 40:52.126
We had to do something.

40:53.428 --> 40:54.946
We had to get rid
of these ashes.

40:54.996 --> 40:57.339
They had to go...

40:57.506 --> 41:00.927
As far away from our house
as possible.

41:02.845 --> 41:06.232
I knew what I wanted to do
with my great-aunt's ashes.

41:06.282 --> 41:10.051
I had a good idea of where
I wanted to scatter her.

41:14.690 --> 41:18.978
She was always very happy
at the casino.

41:19.028 --> 41:21.429
It was definitely a place
that she loved to be.

41:26.035 --> 41:27.954
We just wanted this thing
out of our house

41:28.004 --> 41:30.070
and wanted to move on
with our lives.

41:47.890 --> 41:51.944
As her ashes
were flying in the wind,

41:51.994 --> 41:55.281
you could feel
the sense of relief.

41:55.331 --> 41:58.451
You could feel this sort of...

42:05.809 --> 42:06.760
Did you hear that?

42:06.810 --> 42:08.428
Yeah.

42:08.478 --> 42:09.578
I did.

42:15.318 --> 42:19.421
I knew that now she would be
at peace and be happy.

42:28.164 --> 42:29.783
When we arrived back home,

42:29.833 --> 42:34.621
there was such a sense of peace
and calm in our house.

42:34.671 --> 42:38.540
Our house was no longer
tormented by this negativity.

42:41.511 --> 42:45.065
My grandma had always looked out
for me when I was little,

42:45.115 --> 42:48.301
and now it's a great feeling

42:48.351 --> 42:49.569
knowing that my grandmother

42:49.619 --> 42:52.205
is also taking care
of my daughter

42:52.255 --> 42:55.408
and my great-aunt
was now at peace.
