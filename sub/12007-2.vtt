00:03.183 --> 00:04.248
Cortes' whore?

00:04.284 --> 00:07.085
What happens when your
landlords double our rent?

00:07.120 --> 00:09.103
I pulled out of East Riverside.

00:09.155 --> 00:10.521
- I'm Iris.
- Daphne.

00:10.523 --> 00:12.323
I'm in the interpreter program.

00:12.359 --> 00:13.441
Do you know a guy named Robbie?

00:13.493 --> 00:15.126
Yes, I know who you're talking about.

00:15.161 --> 00:16.361
Is there somewhere I
can leave this for him?

00:16.413 --> 00:17.528
Why don't I just give it to him?

00:17.530 --> 00:19.330
Didn't I make it clear that I'm with him?

00:19.366 --> 00:20.748
Stay away from him.

00:20.784 --> 00:23.334
You didn't know that the turkey
sandwich that you so stupidly handed over

00:23.370 --> 00:26.170
to an inmate had a bag of
heroin stuffed inside it?

00:26.206 --> 00:27.205
Oh my God.

00:27.207 --> 00:30.174
You just became an accessory
to a felony drug deal.

00:30.210 --> 00:33.344
Professor Marillo, I heard that
your "Chemistry 1" class was filled,

00:33.380 --> 00:36.097
and I was hoping to
persuade you to let me in.

00:36.132 --> 00:37.215
You have an interpreter?

00:37.217 --> 00:39.217
We go 90 miles an hour.

00:39.269 --> 00:41.386
Get someone who knows what
the hell they're talking about,

00:41.438 --> 00:43.104
or you will drown.

00:43.139 --> 00:45.390
Josh, this is my roommate Daphne.

00:45.392 --> 00:47.225
I have a proposition for you.

00:47.227 --> 00:49.527
We will text constantly.

00:49.528 --> 00:53.151

- Hey. Hey, good morning.
- No, it's not.

02:17.283 --> 02:19.450
- I have class in 10 minutes.
- What happened?

02:19.486 --> 02:23.454
I wanted to get a full eight
hours before my first chem class,

02:23.490 --> 02:25.456
and I took a sleeping pill.

02:25.492 --> 02:27.391
- Uh-oh.
- It completely knocked me out.

02:27.427 --> 02:29.460
I think I turned off my
alarm and went back to sleep.

02:29.496 --> 02:31.162
I'm sorry. Can I help?

02:31.197 --> 02:32.547
No. I'll see you later.

Are you going to the gym?

03:05.365 --> 03:07.498
Uh, I don't understand.

03:07.534 --> 03:10.451
I wouldn't come to
teach wearing sweatpants.

03:10.503 --> 03:13.204
I ask for the same respect from you.

03:14.374 --> 03:16.123
Of course.

03:16.176 --> 03:17.208
I'm so sorry.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.210
Might be a good time

03:19.212 --> 03:21.379
to go over my other rules.

03:22.432 --> 03:25.216
No phones.

03:25.218 --> 03:26.267
No food.

03:26.302 --> 03:27.435
No drink.

03:28.555 --> 03:29.554
No gum.

03:31.140 --> 03:34.358
Ugh, hate gum. Hate it.

03:35.478 --> 03:38.563
This is 90 minutes for chemistry,

03:38.565 --> 03:41.499
and this material takes a lot of focus.

03:41.534 --> 03:43.632
Coming late, texting,

03:43.670 --> 03:46.404
- _
- eating... all of that takes away concentration

03:46.406 --> 03:48.072
from the other students.

03:49.242 --> 03:51.409
Mr. Padden, you're back.

03:53.496 --> 03:56.130
I'm not in the class.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.217
Just interpreting.

03:59.252 --> 04:00.251
You know sign language?

04:01.304 --> 04:03.187
My parents are deaf.

04:04.307 --> 04:07.258
Well, whatever language you use,

04:07.293 --> 04:09.260
let's try to keep it civil, shall we?

04:12.398 --> 04:15.266
- Office hours are

- _
- Tuesday, Thursday, noon to 2:00,

04:17.237 --> 04:18.269
- _
- sciences building.

04:18.321 --> 04:20.103
- _
- Now, technically I'm there to answer

04:20.156 --> 04:22.106
any questions about the week's material,

04:22.108 --> 04:24.358
- _
- but if you want to come and talk to me about...

04:24.410 --> 04:27.078
- _
- French bulldogs,

04:27.113 --> 04:29.447
- _
- or Claude Debussy, or the science of love...

04:29.449 --> 04:32.790
- which just happens to have been my PhD thesis topic,
- _

04:32.791 --> 04:34.418
- _
- great topic...

04:34.454 --> 04:36.454
I'm very happy to talk about any of that.

04:36.506 --> 04:39.090
If the hours don't work for you,

04:39.125 --> 04:42.126
- _
- let me know. We will work something out.

04:43.179 --> 04:44.345
Any questions so far?

_

04:50.219 --> 04:53.137
(Theme music playing)

04:59.479 --> 05:01.445
So, do you want some breakfast?

05:01.481 --> 05:04.231
Oh, thanks, but I should
get Bay to her gig on time.

05:04.284 --> 05:06.200
- Oh.
- Thank you.

05:06.235 --> 05:08.319
- Hey.
- There's our little community servant.

05:08.321 --> 05:10.154
You ready to go?

05:10.156 --> 05:12.039
- You're driving me?
- Yeah.

05:12.075 --> 05:14.125
The corrections office is on my way to K&D.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.127
Oh, um...

05:16.162 --> 05:17.328
Dad could drive me. Right, dad?

05:17.380 --> 05:18.412
Regina: Why?

05:18.464 --> 05:22.333
The drop off is not at the
corrections office today.

05:22.335 --> 05:23.501
It's in East Riverside.

05:23.553 --> 05:25.336
I didn't think you'd want to go.

05:25.388 --> 05:27.054
(Sighs)

05:27.090 --> 05:28.506
It's been months. I'll be fine.

05:29.559 --> 05:31.142
Here you go, honey.

05:31.177 --> 05:33.427
Have a good day and don't
take anything from strangers.

05:33.479 --> 05:36.230
Actually, because of someone,

05:36.265 --> 05:38.115
we're not allowed to bring lunch anymore.

05:38.151 --> 05:39.350
They're feeding us.

05:39.352 --> 05:41.185
- Thanks anyway.
- Oh.

05:42.355 --> 05:43.487
Thank you.

05:43.523 --> 05:45.189
- See you later.
- Bye.

05:45.241 --> 05:47.358
Hey, you know what? We
should have lunch at the club.

05:47.410 --> 05:50.077
That movie producer is
coming over for coffee,

05:50.113 --> 05:51.412
and I have to get things ready, so...

05:51.447 --> 05:53.130
<i>Batter Up, the movie,</i>

05:53.166 --> 05:55.249
coming soon to a theater near you.

05:55.284 --> 05:57.501
Actually, he emailed me this morning,

05:57.537 --> 05:59.537
and he was wondering if
you were gonna be here.

05:59.572 --> 06:01.172
He wants to meet you.

06:01.207 --> 06:03.207
Really? Why?

06:03.209 --> 06:05.376
Why do people always
want to meet John Kennish?

06:05.378 --> 06:09.046
All right, I'll dust
off a war story or two.

06:10.149 --> 06:11.465
Like that'll be hard to do.

06:11.517 --> 06:16.470
History tells me that
one-third of you will fail.

06:16.522 --> 06:18.472
Of the remaining two-thirds,

06:18.524 --> 06:22.059
few of you will make above a "C."

06:22.061 --> 06:24.278
- _
- At least one of you is going to cry

06:24.313 --> 06:26.447
at some point during this class.

06:26.482 --> 06:28.315
- _
- Oh, and several of you

06:28.368 --> 06:31.152
- _
- will have a grandmother die the night before

06:31.204 --> 06:33.020
- _
- or the morning of the midterm.

06:33.021 --> 06:35.399
- _
- You have my condolences in advance,

06:35.408 --> 06:38.267
- _
- but no, you will not be

06:38.268 --> 06:41.268
- exempt from taking the exam.
- _

06:41.347 --> 06:43.464
- I don't believe in excuses,
- _

06:43.499 --> 06:46.300
- _
- or leniency, or wiggle room.

06:46.335 --> 06:47.501
- Chemistry...
- _

06:47.553 --> 06:49.420
- It is an exact...
- (Claps) _

06:49.472 --> 06:51.422
- Excuse me?
- ... Science governed by laws

06:51.474 --> 06:52.506
and rules.

06:52.558 --> 06:55.226
It's just really distracting.

06:55.261 --> 06:58.229
I like to think I run this
class with similar clarity...

06:58.264 --> 06:59.430
Regina: Are you sure this is it?

06:59.432 --> 07:02.066
Bay: In the alley around back.

07:06.522 --> 07:08.155
Regina: Bye.

07:12.278 --> 07:13.327
Ooh.

07:13.362 --> 07:15.029
Damn it.

07:15.081 --> 07:16.447
(Sighs)

07:16.449 --> 07:19.083
(Soft blues playing)

07:25.425 --> 07:26.507
Hello?

07:31.464 --> 07:35.216
Hi, I'm looking for the owner of
the motorcycle parked out front.

07:35.268 --> 07:37.051
(Sighs) Great.

07:38.187 --> 07:39.386
I'm sorry.

07:39.439 --> 07:40.438
Is it yours?

07:40.473 --> 07:42.389
I...

07:42.442 --> 07:44.141
Sort of tapped it.

07:46.562 --> 07:48.229
Looks like more than a tap.

07:48.281 --> 07:50.080
I... I have insurance.

07:50.116 --> 07:51.449
Still not what I need right now.

07:52.568 --> 07:54.318
You can write down your info here.

07:54.353 --> 07:55.453
Of course.

07:59.325 --> 08:01.242
Well, at least you didn't keep going.

08:01.294 --> 08:03.127
That would be a hit and run.

08:03.162 --> 08:04.161
Only if you got caught.

08:07.250 --> 08:09.200
This place yours? I've
never seen it before.

08:09.235 --> 08:11.001
It was a boot and shoe place.

08:13.239 --> 08:14.338
Right.

08:16.509 --> 08:19.176
- You live around here?
- I used to.

08:19.178 --> 08:21.095
I got this place on the
cheap about six weeks ago.

08:22.148 --> 08:23.647
- Lucky you.
- Yeah.

08:23.683 --> 08:26.150
I guess some big, new development was
supposed to go up across the street,

08:26.185 --> 08:29.086
but it tanked, taking the
property values down with it.

08:29.238 --> 08:30.488
I think I heard something about that.

08:32.191 --> 08:34.441
Is that machine working?
Can I get a cup of coffee?

08:34.494 --> 08:35.442
Sure.

08:38.197 --> 08:39.363
I like the name,

08:39.365 --> 08:40.447
"Cracked Mug."

08:40.500 --> 08:42.265
It feels right for this neighborhood.

08:43.336 --> 08:45.202
Cracked but still here.

08:45.204 --> 08:47.204
Yeah, just like me.

08:47.256 --> 08:48.205
Me too.

08:52.211 --> 08:55.212
So, have you owned other
coffeehouses before?

08:55.264 --> 08:57.381
No, not coffeehouses,

08:57.433 --> 08:58.549
but other businesses.

08:58.551 --> 09:01.318
And I have a lot of opinions about coffee.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.120
Like... ?

09:03.155 --> 09:07.224
Well, everyone's very particular about
the kind of mug they want their coffee in.

09:07.226 --> 09:09.443
Some people like it tall
and skinny to keep it hot.

09:09.478 --> 09:12.112
Other people like it short and big

09:12.148 --> 09:13.397
to wrap their hands around.

09:13.449 --> 09:15.032
Some people like handles.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.201
Other people like the little Chinese cups.

09:17.236 --> 09:19.286
I wanted a place where you could
request the kind of mug you want.

09:20.339 --> 09:22.106
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

09:23.509 --> 09:26.210
I was thinking of putting a chess
and checkers set over in one corner.

09:27.246 --> 09:28.379
Oh, dominoes too.

09:28.414 --> 09:30.347
The old folks around here
love to play dominoes.

09:30.383 --> 09:31.415
Thanks.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.334
I, um...

09:33.386 --> 09:36.387
don't know my license plate number
by heart. I'll be right back.

09:36.422 --> 09:37.504
- Okay.
- 'Kay.

09:42.478 --> 09:44.428
Man: Listen up, I got an announcement.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.098
Because of a recent incident...

09:50.436 --> 09:53.070
Today there's some new rules.

09:53.105 --> 09:55.072
No fraternizing with outsiders.

09:55.107 --> 09:56.523
If I see you talking
to anyone I don't know,

09:56.576 --> 09:58.409
you're getting a write-up.

09:58.444 --> 10:00.277
No going to the bathroom by yourself.

10:00.329 --> 10:02.413
You need to go? See me.

10:02.448 --> 10:04.415
Last thing.

10:04.450 --> 10:06.367
No phones. Not even at lunch.

10:08.454 --> 10:10.504
Turn 'em off, and put them in this bucket.

10:10.539 --> 10:11.505
Now.

10:16.295 --> 10:18.128
What was he talking about?

10:18.180 --> 10:19.380
What incident?

10:19.432 --> 10:21.181
I thought you knew. (Chuckles)

10:21.217 --> 10:23.467
That sandwich I gave
Robbie the last time...

10:24.520 --> 10:26.437
There were drugs in it.

10:26.472 --> 10:28.188
What?

10:28.224 --> 10:30.441
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.

10:30.476 --> 10:32.309
Oh my... that's why he's not here?

10:32.361 --> 10:35.312
- His sister dropped it off.
- He doesn't have a sister.

10:35.314 --> 10:36.563
Brunette, blue car?

10:36.616 --> 10:38.449
That's Annie, his ex.

10:38.484 --> 10:40.484
I knew he was still in
touch with that little whore.

10:40.486 --> 10:43.153
I'm so sorry, Tess. She told
me that she was his sister,

10:43.205 --> 10:45.372
- and that her name was Marcy.
- And you believed her?

10:45.408 --> 10:47.491
Do you know how bad you just
screwed things up for me?

10:47.493 --> 10:49.209
Phones in the bucket.

10:50.296 --> 10:51.412
Robbie got busted with contraband?

10:51.464 --> 10:52.579
That's the word.

10:52.632 --> 10:54.581
But he's still getting
out in a month, right?

10:54.634 --> 10:56.250
Not my area,

10:56.302 --> 10:58.469
- but I doubt it.
- We were gonna move in together.

10:58.504 --> 11:00.304
I put a deposit down on a place.

11:00.339 --> 11:02.222
I'd make a different plan if I were you.

11:02.258 --> 11:03.340
On the other hand,

11:03.392 --> 11:05.342
one more write up and
you'll be behind bars too.

11:05.344 --> 11:07.144
That's kind of like living together.

11:08.481 --> 11:09.513
Phones.

11:15.488 --> 11:17.404
Again, I am really sorry.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.074

11:27.378 --> 11:30.545
These are brownies and scones,

11:30.547 --> 11:34.299
and I also make pan dulce,
if your customers prefer that.

11:34.351 --> 11:35.684
Well, I'm not sure how
much food we're gonna carry,

11:35.719 --> 11:37.352
but I can get back to you.

11:38.389 --> 11:39.471
Well...

11:39.523 --> 11:40.605
Thank you so much.

11:45.396 --> 11:47.446
Juanita. Hi.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.448
What are you doing here?

11:49.483 --> 11:51.650
I'm just here for coffee.

11:51.702 --> 11:54.736
(Scoffs) I can't believe you have the nerve

11:54.788 --> 11:56.338
to show your face.

11:56.373 --> 11:58.740
I wasn't the one who pulled
the plug on the project.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.475
No, your boyfriend did,

12:00.511 --> 12:03.645
after he cheated everyone out of
a fair price for their businesses.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.448
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Do you think things were bad before?

12:06.483 --> 12:08.250
They are a lot worse now.

12:08.252 --> 12:10.385
I'm asking this man if
he will buy my brownies.

12:10.421 --> 12:12.304
I am so sorry.

12:12.339 --> 12:15.287
- When the project folded, I lost too.
- Oh, please.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.226
(Yelling) Look at you with your fancy purse

12:17.228 --> 12:18.477
and your fancy jacket!

12:18.529 --> 12:21.230
What did you lose?

12:21.232 --> 12:23.315
- Juanita, yelling at me...
- Go to hell!

12:23.567 --> 12:24.799
<i>Malinche.</i>

12:30.124 --> 12:31.456
Well, I just figured out who you are.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.127
Sorry about that.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.413
You all done writing down your info?

12:38.415 --> 12:39.414
Yeah.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.171
And you can take this...

12:46.223 --> 12:47.339
To go.

12:48.475 --> 12:50.425
Look, I don't know all the facts,

12:50.477 --> 12:52.427
but I'm trying to start a business here.

12:52.429 --> 12:54.396
And as a guy from the outside,

12:54.431 --> 12:55.430
I'm already suspect.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.151
I can't afford to start
out on the wrong foot.

13:01.105 --> 13:02.154
Got it.

13:04.441 --> 13:06.275
And then same thing...

13:06.310 --> 13:08.110
If you add an "o5,"

13:08.145 --> 13:11.079
you get "h2-c2-o5,"

13:11.115 --> 13:13.115
or peroxalic acid.

13:15.369 --> 13:17.336
Okay, you know what? Let's just stop there.

13:17.371 --> 13:21.206
Congratulations, you
survived your first class.

13:21.258 --> 13:25.210
Nobody fainted, nobody lost
their organic granola breakfast.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.461
- Come on, give yourselves a hand.
- (Applause)

13:26.513 --> 13:28.263
Very good.

13:28.299 --> 13:29.464
Get out of here.

13:29.466 --> 13:33.185
Oh, I advise forming study groups of four.

13:33.220 --> 13:36.138
That will keep you honest, okay?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.472
See you tomorrow.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.361
Hey, you guys look smart.
Can I be in your group?

13:42.396 --> 13:44.112
- Yes.
- Yeah, that'd be awesome

13:44.148 --> 13:47.065
- do you know anyone here?
- No.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.234
Do you want me to ask if...

13:49.286 --> 13:50.319
No, I got it.

13:54.408 --> 13:55.407
Hi.

13:55.459 --> 13:56.491
Hi.

13:56.543 --> 13:58.327
I'm Daphne.

13:58.329 --> 13:59.461
Vimla.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.414
- Is this your study group?
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.002
It looks like you need one more.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.136
Can I be your fourth?

14:08.172 --> 14:09.137
Sure.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.392
Um, if it's okay with you guys.

14:14.511 --> 14:16.178
- Of course.
- Yeah, why not.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.262
Thanks so much.

14:18.432 --> 14:20.265
Of course we'll have the ball players,

14:20.317 --> 14:22.284
and the groupies, and the sex-capades.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.435
Those are just the fireworks,

14:23.487 --> 14:28.190
but it all needs to be
grounded in something personal,

14:28.192 --> 14:29.491
emotional.

14:29.526 --> 14:32.444
Well, to me, it's a story of a
woman who loses her innocence.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.446
That is exactly what I was going to say.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.332
Good, I'm glad you agree.

14:37.368 --> 14:39.368
So just make sure you
don't lose sight of that

14:39.420 --> 14:41.086
when you're writing the screenplay.

14:41.121 --> 14:44.072
Um... wait.

14:44.108 --> 14:46.091
You want me to write the screenplay?

14:46.126 --> 14:49.211
I mean, you know I've never
written one before, right?

14:49.213 --> 14:50.462
So what?

14:50.514 --> 14:53.215
Don't you want someone with
more of a track record? I mean...

14:53.267 --> 14:55.300
Let me ask you something.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.551
When you were writing the book,

14:56.553 --> 14:59.388
did you see the story as...

14:59.390 --> 15:01.189
Pictures in your mind?

15:01.225 --> 15:03.191
Oh, yeah, of course I did.

15:03.227 --> 15:05.060
Well, then you've already written it.

15:05.062 --> 15:07.062
The rest is just a format.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.232
Any valet parker in
L.A. can teach you that.

15:10.267 --> 15:13.235
We'll hire one, a few bucks
a week, as your assistant,

15:13.237 --> 15:15.287
boom. Instant screenplay.

15:15.322 --> 15:17.289
(Chuckles) Boom.

15:18.542 --> 15:21.243
- Who pays for that?
- Oh. Production.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.377
Comes right out of the budget,

15:22.413 --> 15:25.247
which, for a film like
this, is about $6 million,

15:25.299 --> 15:28.083
and I've got four of it lined up already.

15:28.118 --> 15:29.418
- (Gasps)
- (Phone vibrates)

15:29.420 --> 15:32.387
Oh, I'm sorry. It's my editor.

15:32.423 --> 15:34.256
I told her I was meeting with you,

15:34.258 --> 15:37.309
and I just want to tell her that she
might be talking to a new screenwriter.

15:37.344 --> 15:39.261
(Laughs)

15:39.263 --> 15:41.096
Let her know you got a hit here!

15:41.098 --> 15:42.147
(Laughs)

15:43.400 --> 15:45.100
And I do believe that.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.102
I would not have flown all
the way out here from L.A.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.487
to meet with the two of you if I didn't.

15:48.522 --> 15:51.406
Thank you. It's... I had
nothing to do with it.

15:51.442 --> 15:53.108
It's all Kathryn.

15:53.110 --> 15:56.278
But you do believe that her book
would make a great movie, yes?

15:57.498 --> 15:59.114
- Absolutely.
- Great.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.282
Good, I'm glad you think so.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.085
Because this film...

16:04.204 --> 16:05.454
it can be your success, too.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.290
Really?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.295
Hey.

16:13.297 --> 16:15.297
- Leave me alone.
- Look.

16:15.299 --> 16:17.299
I said I was sorry.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.134
Does that help me?

16:19.136 --> 16:20.302
Let me make it up to you.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.553
How?

16:21.605 --> 16:24.222
Can you get in a time machine,
go back, and stay the hell away

16:24.274 --> 16:26.475
from Robbie like I told
you to in the first place?

16:26.477 --> 16:28.393
I wish that I had.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.363
I'm screwed here, too. My
boyfriend's in California,

16:31.398 --> 16:33.365
and he's probably calling me
right now, and I can't answer

16:33.400 --> 16:36.151
- because my phone's...
- You can't talk to your boyfriend?

16:36.203 --> 16:38.236
I am this close to losing
my kid to foster care...

16:38.288 --> 16:39.488
- I know you have it way worse.
- Gordon: Hey!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.406
... and you can't talk to your boyfriend?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.158
Hey, hey, hey!

16:43.160 --> 16:44.209
What is it with you two?

16:44.244 --> 16:46.411
I told you to cut out the bickering.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.413
I was just sitting here.
She started in on me.

16:48.465 --> 16:51.082
I did not start in on you.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.218
Eh, eh, eh. Come with me.

16:53.253 --> 16:55.253
I know how to make everyone happy.

17:04.348 --> 17:06.064
What's that smell?

17:06.098 --> 17:08.233
My guess is a dead rat.

17:11.104 --> 17:12.354
I don't think this is safe.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.021
That's what these are for.

17:15.025 --> 17:16.241
Now...

17:16.276 --> 17:17.358
When you find the jackpot,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.194
bag it, put it with
the rest of the garbage.

17:21.281 --> 17:23.281
I thought you said this was
gonna make everyone happy?

17:24.367 --> 17:27.202
Oops, I meant it was
going to make me happy.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.371
This is not fair. I was
minding my own business.

17:29.373 --> 17:31.206
Give me a reason, Tess.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.291
You think I give a rat's ass that
you have a kid waiting for you

17:33.343 --> 17:35.377
back at whatever pit you crawled out of?

17:35.379 --> 17:37.045
I don't.

17:37.047 --> 17:39.181
I wouldn't think twice about writing you up

17:39.216 --> 17:40.382
and getting you locked up like Robbie,

17:40.434 --> 17:42.517
just so I don't have
to look at you anymore.

17:42.553 --> 17:44.352
So give me a reason.

17:46.223 --> 17:47.389
Now what do you have to say?

17:57.401 --> 18:00.402
Hey, I left some mail for you
that somehow landed in our box.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.070
Thanks.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.121
You're home early.

18:03.156 --> 18:05.156
Yeah, I never made it in.

18:06.243 --> 18:07.292
Why's that?

18:09.046 --> 18:11.129
Uh, when I...

18:11.164 --> 18:13.999
dropped Bay off in East
Riverside I got ambushed

18:14.051 --> 18:16.051
by somebody pretty pissed off at me

18:16.086 --> 18:17.385
for what happened with the development.

18:17.421 --> 18:19.421
Regina, people get emotional.

18:19.423 --> 18:22.140
You gotta take their
griping with a grain of salt.

18:23.176 --> 18:24.259
I know. It just...

18:25.312 --> 18:27.429
It made me sad all over again.

18:27.431 --> 18:29.431
I wanted to do something
good for the neighborhood.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.316
I know you did.

18:31.351 --> 18:33.151
Anyway, I mean...

18:33.186 --> 18:35.320
after getting yelled at like that,

18:35.355 --> 18:37.272
I didn't want to go to K&D

18:37.324 --> 18:40.325
and stare at tasteful,
beige wallpaper samples.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.444
Sounds like an honest day's work to me,

18:42.446 --> 18:45.113
and I would imagine that
customer will not be calling you

18:45.115 --> 18:46.448
with death threats.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.251
Look, it's just my opinion, but
I think you should steer clear

18:49.286 --> 18:51.036
of that neighborhood for the time being.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.254
Yeah.

18:57.127 --> 18:58.260
(Gags)

18:59.263 --> 19:01.012
I think I found it.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.013
Is it a rat?

19:03.050 --> 19:04.199
How do I know? It's in there.

19:04.234 --> 19:07.218
I see something, but I
don't think we can reach it.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.054
You're gonna have to
crawl in there and get it.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.389
Me? Hah, no. You can do it.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.141
It's your fault we're
here in the first place.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.359
You were arguing too.

19:14.394 --> 19:16.111
You got Robbie in trouble.

19:16.146 --> 19:17.279
I gave him his lunch!

19:17.314 --> 19:19.030
- I'm not going in there.
- Listen to me.

19:19.066 --> 19:20.982
You owe me.

19:21.034 --> 19:23.151
You said you wanted to make it
up to me. Here's your chance.

19:23.153 --> 19:24.402
Do it.

19:32.496 --> 19:35.080
Hey. Don't forget these.

19:39.086 --> 19:40.251
(Groans)

19:44.352 --> 19:48.847
_

19:48.850 --> 19:52.199
_

19:57.480 --> 19:59.847
Tank: Hey, hey! Felonious B. Kennish.

19:59.849 --> 20:01.348
What are you doing here?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.684
Oh, your brother had some D.J. emergency.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.519
Now come on, I had to park a block away.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.691
What's that smell?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.443
- You don't want to know.
- Hmm.

20:12.495 --> 20:13.527
Bad day?

20:13.529 --> 20:15.529
The only kind I have right now.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.530
What happened?

20:17.583 --> 20:18.866
I tried to do something nice,

20:18.868 --> 20:22.419
and I ended up getting on the
wrong side of this Godzilla,

20:22.455 --> 20:23.704
who now has it out for me.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.673
Ooh, is she fire-breathing?

20:25.708 --> 20:28.425
I don't know, but she's
definitely out for blood.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.461
You just got to stand up to her.

20:30.513 --> 20:31.679
How?

20:31.714 --> 20:32.763
Take her on.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.882
If she's Godzilla, you gotta be Ghidorah.

20:34.884 --> 20:37.718
- Who?
- It's Godzilla's Nemesis.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.803
Look, when you show up for work tomorrow,

20:39.855 --> 20:41.555
go up to her,

20:41.557 --> 20:42.856
and just start whaling on her.

20:42.982 --> 20:44.948
- Tank!
- What? Prison rules.

20:46.018 --> 20:47.651
<i>Haven't you seen Escape From Alcatraz?</i>

20:47.703 --> 20:49.486
I'm not in prison,

20:49.538 --> 20:51.488
and I'm not gonna go
up and whale on anybody.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.740
Do you remember who I am?

20:52.792 --> 20:54.992
Yes, do you remember what I
taught you in field hockey?

20:54.994 --> 20:56.627
No.

20:56.662 --> 20:57.878
Okay. All right, look.

20:57.913 --> 20:59.830
You gotta face the ball with fury.

20:59.882 --> 21:00.881
(Growls)

21:02.635 --> 21:03.667
(Growls louder)

21:03.719 --> 21:05.719
- Come on, let's see it.
- What else you got?

21:05.755 --> 21:07.921
(Sighs) Um...

21:07.973 --> 21:09.723
How about a peace offering?

21:09.759 --> 21:11.508
Yeah, tried that, didn't work.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.594
Well, can you ask to
transfer to another work crew?

21:13.646 --> 21:14.845
That's not an option.

21:14.847 --> 21:16.313
(Sighs) Well...

21:16.349 --> 21:18.849
Look, you gotta find some way to
show her you're not gonna back down,

21:18.851 --> 21:20.651
or every day is gonna be like this.

21:22.855 --> 21:24.855
The metal loses electrons
to become a cation,

21:24.907 --> 21:26.857
and the nonmetal gains
electrons to become an anion.

21:26.859 --> 21:28.909
- Cat is the positive one, right?
- Wait, are you sure?

21:28.944 --> 21:30.911
Yeah, and the resulting
compound name ends in "ide,"

21:30.946 --> 21:32.579
like magnesium bromide.

21:32.615 --> 21:34.498
- Wait, what was that?
- Magnesium bromide.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.533
It's just an example of an ionic compound.

21:36.585 --> 21:37.835
I wanna what?

21:39.538 --> 21:41.588
(Muffled speaking)

21:48.547 --> 21:50.631
Time out. Guys, I can't interpret

21:50.683 --> 21:51.882
for all three of you at the same time.

21:51.884 --> 21:53.801
If we could just slow down a little bit.

21:53.853 --> 21:56.603
- Slow down? We need to go faster.
- Sorry.

21:56.639 --> 21:58.104
It's just, we're slogging through this,

21:58.105 --> 21:59.696
and we still have another chapter to cover.

22:00.559 --> 22:02.776
You know what? Why don't
we just call it for tonight,

22:02.812 --> 22:04.695
and we can review the rest on our own.

22:04.730 --> 22:06.480
No, no. We don't need to stop.

22:06.532 --> 22:07.948
I just need a moment to catch up.

22:07.983 --> 22:10.901
The more people that are talking
at once, the harder it is to follow.

22:12.571 --> 22:13.821
I'll get better at it.

22:13.873 --> 22:14.905
Josh will, too.

22:14.957 --> 22:17.458
Don't worry about it.
I'll see you in class.

22:25.918 --> 22:27.584
(Sighs)

22:27.586 --> 22:29.787
You know, honey, I thought that producer

22:29.805 --> 22:32.589
was just gonna wanna
talk about the sex scenes,

22:32.641 --> 22:33.757
but he surprised me.

22:33.759 --> 22:35.759
He wants to give the characters more depth.

22:35.811 --> 22:37.594
We are totally in sync.

22:38.931 --> 22:41.515
(Sighs) You didn't like him, did you?

22:42.651 --> 22:44.735
You know, I thought he was a little slick.

22:44.770 --> 22:46.603
I think you can do better.

22:46.605 --> 22:48.522
Better? How?

22:48.574 --> 22:50.941
He's the only serious interest
I've had in the movie rights.

22:50.993 --> 22:54.528
Well, you don't have to pick him just
'cause he's the only one who asked.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.696
I see.

22:55.748 --> 22:56.780
What?

22:56.782 --> 22:58.782
(Sighs) Forget it.

22:58.818 --> 22:59.833
Kathryn!

23:01.821 --> 23:04.455
You're used to getting all the attention.

23:04.507 --> 23:06.457
Ex-major league ball player,

23:06.509 --> 23:08.675
and all he wanted to do
was talk about my book.

23:08.711 --> 23:10.461
Admit it.

23:10.513 --> 23:12.763
Your ego is a little bruised.

23:12.798 --> 23:14.598
Right?

23:14.633 --> 23:15.799
(Chuckles) Come on.

23:17.937 --> 23:19.720
He was fishing for money.

23:21.857 --> 23:24.475
He needs to raise $6
million to make the movie.

23:27.613 --> 23:29.730
He said he had all the money lined up.

23:29.782 --> 23:31.949
Yeah, he was bluffing.

23:33.519 --> 23:35.652
When you took the call,
he hit me up for a million,

23:35.704 --> 23:38.889
and asked if I knew any other retired
ballplayers who might be interested.

23:38.924 --> 23:40.624
Does he...

23:41.794 --> 23:43.827
Even want to make the movie?

23:43.829 --> 23:45.963
If I finance it, yeah.

23:47.633 --> 23:48.665
(Sighs)

23:49.869 --> 23:50.901
I see.

23:51.921 --> 23:53.921
Hey, I'm sorry.

23:57.977 --> 23:59.810
I'm gonna get some air.

24:03.933 --> 24:05.616
(Sighs)

24:06.852 --> 24:09.770
That was a disaster. I can't
be unprepared like that again.

24:09.822 --> 24:12.523
Why are you acting like that was my fault?

24:12.525 --> 24:15.859
We need to come up with signs so you
don't have to fingerspell everything.

24:15.861 --> 24:17.744
There are a lot of words!

24:17.780 --> 24:20.664
We'll start with the common
elements of the periodic table.

24:22.952 --> 24:24.701
(Chattering)

24:27.873 --> 24:29.706
What's going on?

24:29.708 --> 24:31.592
Oh. (Scoffs)

24:31.627 --> 24:32.793
Didn't you get my text?

24:32.845 --> 24:34.545
I texted everyone.

24:35.931 --> 24:37.548
There was no text.

24:39.635 --> 24:40.767
I don't understand.

24:42.521 --> 24:44.721
They're meeting without you.

24:46.692 --> 24:48.642
Look, it's not personal.

24:48.694 --> 24:49.726
Hmm.

24:49.778 --> 24:51.895
'Cause dumping someone never is.

24:51.897 --> 24:53.830
We just have to go at a different pace.

24:53.866 --> 24:56.567
We think maybe you'd be better
off in a different group.

24:57.736 --> 24:59.736
I'm sorry that I was so...

24:59.738 --> 25:00.737
Why are you sorry?

25:01.807 --> 25:03.490
They should be sorry.

25:04.660 --> 25:07.578
What? They can't take
the extra three minutes

25:07.580 --> 25:09.663
it would take to let us catch up?

25:09.715 --> 25:13.584
- Josh, I got this.
- You guys are training to be doctors, right?

25:14.720 --> 25:16.837
To heal people who are sick?

25:16.889 --> 25:18.839
You guys are douchebags.

25:18.891 --> 25:20.424
- Stop.
- Did you know that?

25:20.476 --> 25:21.758
- Total douchebags.
- Stop!

25:33.772 --> 25:34.905
What the hell was that?

25:34.940 --> 25:36.740
I was expressing my opinion.

25:36.775 --> 25:38.692
You don't have an opinion.

25:38.744 --> 25:39.776
You're an interpreter.

25:39.828 --> 25:41.945
You don't have a voice.
You don't have a presence.

25:41.947 --> 25:43.614
You don't have opinions.

25:43.666 --> 25:46.450
I'm not gonna just stand there
and take that from those...

25:46.502 --> 25:48.919
Your job is to interpret what I can't hear,

25:48.954 --> 25:51.755
not to speak for me, not to think for me,

25:51.790 --> 25:53.590
not to defend me,

25:53.626 --> 25:54.925
and not to piss off my classmates.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.710
Well, I can't do that.

25:56.762 --> 25:58.879
I can't just stand there like a robot.

25:59.932 --> 26:01.715
Well, then you're fired.

26:01.767 --> 26:02.799
What?

26:05.704 --> 26:06.770
Fine.

26:13.194 --> 26:14.476
Renzo: Feeling better?

26:14.528 --> 26:17.279
(Sighs) A little. I just feel
silly for getting my hopes up.

26:17.315 --> 26:18.314
You never know.

26:18.366 --> 26:20.366
A movie version of your
book could still happen.

26:20.401 --> 26:24.320
No, that guy was the only
halfway-legitimate contender.

26:24.372 --> 26:26.455
Besides, it would have
made a bad movie, anyway.

26:26.490 --> 26:29.408
It would have been a great
movie if it were done right.

26:29.460 --> 26:31.493
But you know Hollywood,
they'd put Kate Hudson in it

26:31.545 --> 26:34.246
<i>and that smarmy Jim guy
from The Office and ruin it.</i>

26:34.298 --> 26:35.381
I like him.

26:35.416 --> 26:37.583
You should have Lydia take it to Broadway.

26:37.635 --> 26:39.168
They could make a musical out of it.

26:39.220 --> 26:40.419
- Oh, yeah, right.
- (Laughs)

26:40.471 --> 26:42.238
At least there'd be some dancing in it.

26:42.273 --> 26:44.473
Pa, pa-pa, pa-pa, pow!

26:44.508 --> 26:47.343
There could be like a whole
chorus line of shirtless ballboys.

26:47.395 --> 26:48.510
Yes, please!

26:48.562 --> 26:51.180
<i>♪ Oh, say, what do you see? ♪</i>

26:51.232 --> 26:53.515
<i>♪ Those balls don't look foul to me ♪</i>

26:53.567 --> 26:55.567
<i>♪ come on, boys, raise those mitts ♪</i>

26:55.603 --> 26:57.319
<i>♪ touch those bases, get some hits ♪</i>

26:57.355 --> 27:00.155
<i>♪ put your ball in my
glove, it's a home run ♪</i>

27:00.191 --> 27:03.108
<i>♪ this is love ♪</i>

27:03.160 --> 27:04.493
Yeah!

27:04.528 --> 27:06.495
See? It writes itself.

27:11.496 --> 27:14.192
_

27:14.193 --> 27:17.539
- _
- Is that all you're eating?

27:17.591 --> 27:19.375
I'm not really hungry.

27:19.377 --> 27:22.378
- _
- All right. (Sighs)

27:23.431 --> 27:25.214
How's Emmett?

27:25.266 --> 27:26.282
Fine.

27:27.418 --> 27:28.484
Bay?

27:28.485 --> 27:30.426
_

27:31.489 --> 27:32.554
- Bay!
- Hmm?

27:32.556 --> 27:34.390
Do you mind looking at me
when I'm talking to you?

27:35.393 --> 27:37.326
I'm sorry. Emmett's going into a screening,

27:37.361 --> 27:38.560
and he's not gonna be
able to use his phone.

27:40.164 --> 27:42.398
I'm not sure how healthy
all this constant texting is.

27:42.400 --> 27:46.168
Dad, I had to beg him
to go to L.A. without me,

27:46.203 --> 27:48.404
and he still could change
his mind at any minute.

27:48.456 --> 27:51.373
If he could make it through a couple weeks,

27:51.409 --> 27:54.493
make some friends, then he'll
be okay. But until then...

27:54.545 --> 27:56.462
I have to make him believe

27:56.497 --> 28:00.249
that it's not a big deal we're
so far away from each other.

28:01.385 --> 28:02.501
Okay.

28:02.553 --> 28:04.169
Please tell him we send our best.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.366
_

28:10.367 --> 28:17.134
_

28:18.981 --> 28:22.455
_

28:24.180 --> 28:28.548
_

28:31.415 --> 28:33.382
You fired him?

28:33.417 --> 28:35.417
So, who's gonna interpret for you?

28:35.453 --> 28:37.119
No one.

28:37.121 --> 28:38.287
There's no one else.

28:39.523 --> 28:42.257
I just have to do it myself.

28:45.629 --> 28:49.348
I need to get better at
lip-reading chemistry words.

28:49.383 --> 28:51.216
Can you help me practice?

28:51.268 --> 28:52.351
Sure.

28:52.386 --> 28:55.354
I highlighted a bunch of
words that I need to recognize.

28:55.389 --> 28:57.573
Just read them and jump around.

28:57.608 --> 28:58.524
Okay.

29:04.148 --> 29:05.364
Coefficient.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.484
- Coefficient.
- (Giggles)

29:10.287 --> 29:12.154
Polyatomic.

29:12.156 --> 29:14.239
Polyatomic.

29:14.291 --> 29:17.326
Pick a hard one and don't over enunciate,

29:17.378 --> 29:18.494
'cause she won't.

29:22.383 --> 29:23.332
Halogenated.

29:26.437 --> 29:27.436
Halogenated.

29:31.542 --> 29:32.574
(Sighs)

29:34.261 --> 29:35.411
How long do you need it?

29:41.185 --> 29:43.519
It's a type of unsaturated hydrocarbon.

29:45.189 --> 29:46.321
Try again.

29:50.361 --> 29:51.360
Enthalpies.

29:53.431 --> 29:55.164
It looks like you're saying,

29:55.199 --> 29:57.416
"end of peace," but I know that's wrong.

29:59.370 --> 30:00.419
(Groans)

30:03.374 --> 30:04.540
It just takes practice.

30:09.213 --> 30:10.262
Pick another word.

30:15.700 --> 30:16.865
What's the 911?

30:16.867 --> 30:18.701
All right, this might
seem a little crazy, but...

30:18.753 --> 30:19.868
The musical!

30:19.870 --> 30:21.870
Yes! I couldn't sleep all night.

30:21.872 --> 30:24.006
I kept seeing dance numbers in my head,

30:24.041 --> 30:25.841
and writing lyrics to songs.

30:25.876 --> 30:27.843
Didn't I tell you? I'm a genius.

30:27.878 --> 30:29.011
But that's the thing.

30:29.046 --> 30:31.930
You're right. This would
make a good musical,

30:31.966 --> 30:33.882
but I've never written one before.

30:33.884 --> 30:35.851
So? You'd never written a book before,

30:35.886 --> 30:37.720
and now you've written two.

30:37.755 --> 30:38.854
That's true.

30:38.889 --> 30:40.889
You know, we should do it.

30:40.891 --> 30:42.725
Whoa, "we"?

30:42.777 --> 30:44.893
Yes, you're the one that
got the ball rolling.

30:44.945 --> 30:47.029
No, no, no. That's all I'm good for...

30:47.064 --> 30:49.865
the big picture, not the details.

30:49.900 --> 30:52.901
Like, I could tell Ricardo that
his guest bath needed a new look,

30:52.953 --> 30:54.870
but I couldn't tell him which tile to buy.

30:54.905 --> 30:57.072
It's your idea. You run with it.

30:58.642 --> 30:59.875
Okay, but...

30:59.910 --> 31:01.710
Will you come to see it,
even if nobody else does?

31:01.746 --> 31:04.630
Are you kidding? I'll be
leading the standing ovation.

31:05.883 --> 31:07.883
But first, let's cast that
chorus line of shirtless ballboys.

31:31.942 --> 31:33.075
I thought I fired you.

31:34.862 --> 31:35.944
Didn't stick.

31:38.682 --> 31:39.948
Did Iris call you?

31:46.724 --> 31:48.874
That was nice of her, but...

31:48.926 --> 31:50.092
This isn't working out.

31:50.127 --> 31:51.710
Here's the thing.

31:53.798 --> 31:55.881
Hearing kid, deaf parents.

31:58.736 --> 32:01.937
I was their ears and
voice starting at age five.

32:04.692 --> 32:07.025
If the cleaners ruined my dad's shirt,

32:07.061 --> 32:10.612
or if my mom's soup was too salty...

32:10.648 --> 32:12.648
You had to fight their battles.

32:15.986 --> 32:17.820
It wasn't all bad.

32:18.989 --> 32:21.740
In fourth grade, the
interpreter didn't show up,

32:21.792 --> 32:25.911
so I had to interpret my own
parent-teacher conference.

32:25.963 --> 32:29.665
I bet your behavior was perfect.

32:30.718 --> 32:31.967
She said

32:32.002 --> 32:35.888
I was doing excellent in every arena.

32:35.923 --> 32:37.005
(Chuckles)

32:39.877 --> 32:41.059
All this to say...

32:42.947 --> 32:44.646
someone like you,

32:44.682 --> 32:46.815
an empowered deafie...

32:47.935 --> 32:49.017
it's a new thing for me.

32:50.070 --> 32:52.020
I just have to get used to it.

32:58.762 --> 32:59.945
I need you,

32:59.997 --> 33:02.781
but I can't have you talking for me.

33:02.833 --> 33:03.782
Ears only.

33:04.952 --> 33:06.001
Got it.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.590
So...

33:11.625 --> 33:14.710
I stopped by the
chemistry department and...

33:14.712 --> 33:16.712
got the notes for the next class.

33:27.725 --> 33:28.957
You get advanced notes?

33:31.896 --> 33:32.945
Yeah.

33:43.657 --> 33:45.624
Hey, let me use your phone.

33:45.659 --> 33:47.075
I'm waiting for a call.
What's wrong with yours?

33:47.111 --> 33:48.627
It's out of minutes.

33:48.662 --> 33:50.746
- It's important.
- So is the call that I'm waiting for.

33:50.798 --> 33:52.047
What, your boyfriend?

33:52.082 --> 33:55.634
I have to call Robbie's
lawyer about getting him out.

33:55.669 --> 33:58.587
You remember Robbie, the guy
who got busted because of you.

33:58.639 --> 34:00.756
You can borrow it as soon
as I'm done with my call.

34:00.758 --> 34:02.591
Lunch will be over by then.

34:02.593 --> 34:03.759
- You owe me.
- (Sighs)

34:03.811 --> 34:05.761
Hey! No, that is my phone.

34:05.763 --> 34:06.929
Give me the friggin' phone!

34:12.987 --> 34:14.652
There's your phone.

34:15.822 --> 34:17.656
You psycho!

34:18.775 --> 34:20.609
I do not owe you anything.

34:20.610 --> 34:22.860
That guy got busted
because he is a drug dealer.

34:22.913 --> 34:24.746
That is on him, not me.

34:24.782 --> 34:26.782
I told you messing with me was a mistake.

34:26.833 --> 34:28.033
Do whatever you want.

34:28.085 --> 34:29.952
I already can't go to L.A.
to be with my boyfriend

34:29.954 --> 34:31.036
for a whole year.

34:31.088 --> 34:33.789
I got nothing else to lose.

34:33.841 --> 34:35.623
Hey. Hey!

34:35.676 --> 34:36.925
What the hell is going on?

34:40.797 --> 34:41.847
What's the problem here, Tess?

34:44.851 --> 34:46.051
Did she do that?

34:55.145 --> 34:56.695
No, I dropped it.

35:00.818 --> 35:02.818
All right. 15 minutes
and we're back to work.

35:24.003 --> 35:25.303
Not my bike again.

35:26.339 --> 35:27.972
I want you to know

35:28.007 --> 35:30.341
I got involved with the development
project for all the right reasons.

35:31.344 --> 35:33.110
You don't owe me an explanation.

35:33.146 --> 35:35.947
You took Juanita's word about
what happened and threw me out.

35:37.150 --> 35:39.016
Threw you out is an overstatement.

35:40.353 --> 35:42.236
I grew up in this neighborhood.

35:42.272 --> 35:45.022
I saw a chance to do something
good for it, and I took it.

35:45.058 --> 35:47.992
But I got in over my head,

35:48.027 --> 35:49.160
and I made mistakes.

35:50.196 --> 35:51.412
I still think I could do something good.

35:52.465 --> 35:54.999
Let me help you with your coffeehouse.

35:55.034 --> 35:56.667
Help how?

35:56.703 --> 35:59.921
I'm an interior designer. I can give your
place the look you want to get it open.

36:00.957 --> 36:02.256
(Laughs)

36:02.292 --> 36:05.042
Uh, I don't think that would be
a smart move for me right now.

36:06.379 --> 36:08.045
_

36:09.098 --> 36:10.882
I can hire someone who speaks Spanish.

36:12.185 --> 36:13.384
But I grew up here.

36:13.386 --> 36:15.052
I know these people.

36:15.054 --> 36:16.220
Yeah, and they don't like you,

36:16.272 --> 36:17.355
and they don't trust you.

36:17.390 --> 36:19.974
They used to, and I can win them back.

36:20.026 --> 36:22.059
What does that have to do
with me and my coffeehouse?

36:22.111 --> 36:24.395
Well, this is how I get
them back on my side.

36:24.397 --> 36:26.998
And in exchange, I can bring money

36:28.034 --> 36:30.001
to help you get this place up and running.

36:30.036 --> 36:33.070
Things are always more
expensive than they say at first.

36:34.374 --> 36:36.958
Well, I did get an estimate on
bringing the plumbing up to code.

36:38.077 --> 36:39.343
You wanna draw people in?

36:39.379 --> 36:40.411
Make this a neighborhood hangout?

36:41.414 --> 36:43.381
We could make part of the space

36:43.416 --> 36:45.249
an art gallery for local artists,

36:45.251 --> 36:47.969
or once a week we can do an open mic night.

36:48.004 --> 36:50.338
There are some really talented
people in this neighborhood.

36:50.390 --> 36:52.924
We can sell Juanita's brownies,

36:52.976 --> 36:54.225
but also carry healthy snacks

36:54.260 --> 36:56.177
so that parents have options
when they bring their kids.

36:56.229 --> 36:57.979
We don't even know each other.

36:58.014 --> 36:59.313
I'm Regina.

36:59.349 --> 37:00.348
Regina Vasquez.

37:01.401 --> 37:03.100
<i>Also known as la malinche.</i>

37:03.136 --> 37:05.102
<i>What is malinche anyway?</i>

37:05.154 --> 37:06.938
A traitorous whore.

37:06.990 --> 37:08.189
Damn.

37:08.241 --> 37:09.907
Yeah.

37:11.244 --> 37:12.326
Eric.

37:12.362 --> 37:13.945
Eric Bishop.

37:18.284 --> 37:20.918
Whoo, Jimmy. (Clears throat)

37:20.954 --> 37:22.086
Looks like you hit the jackpot.

37:22.121 --> 37:26.290
All right, we got another
dead rat, and this one's ripe.

37:26.342 --> 37:28.042
Who's gonna do the honors?

37:31.264 --> 37:32.964
Who's a team player?

37:34.050 --> 37:35.216
Come on. It's not getting any fresher.

37:39.222 --> 37:41.305
She's not supposed to do that.

37:41.307 --> 37:43.140
What'd you say?

37:43.192 --> 37:44.942
We're not supposed to touch dead animals.

37:44.978 --> 37:46.394
You're supposed to call animal control.

37:46.446 --> 37:47.979
Says who?

37:47.981 --> 37:49.363
There's a lawsuit against
the county about it.

37:50.984 --> 37:52.149
I mean, if you don't care about that...

37:57.156 --> 37:59.290
All right. Somebody give
me some tongs. I'll do it.

38:03.913 --> 38:05.162
(Whispers) Thank you.

38:05.164 --> 38:06.330
It's no big deal.

38:10.136 --> 38:11.919
Kathryn: Okay.

38:11.971 --> 38:13.170
Gentle.

38:13.222 --> 38:15.890
Just around the corner.

38:17.010 --> 38:19.226
Right over here. This is perfect.

38:19.262 --> 38:21.062
There you go.

38:22.098 --> 38:24.265
Ah. Did I miss something?

38:24.317 --> 38:25.349
I bought a piano.

38:28.187 --> 38:31.188

39:08.277 --> 39:09.276

39:24.243 --> 39:25.376
About yesterday...

39:26.963 --> 39:28.913
maybe we could have handled it better.

39:31.217 --> 39:32.383
We'd like to have you back in the group.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.921
You mean me and my advanced notes.

39:38.091 --> 39:39.390
They'd be helpful.

39:39.425 --> 39:41.092
We'd be helping each other out.

40:06.035 --> 40:08.285
I need you to slow down and speak clearly,

40:08.287 --> 40:11.088
so that I can follow the discussion.

40:11.124 --> 40:13.290
Either I or Josh will let you
know when you're going too fast.

40:13.292 --> 40:15.126
Agreed.

40:15.128 --> 40:16.377
We're meeting at 7:00 tonight,

40:16.429 --> 40:17.962
the chem classroom.

40:20.233 --> 40:22.133
We'll be there.
