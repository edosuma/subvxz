I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ALMOST DID THAT.

40:25.625 --> 40:27.594
I KNOW.

40:27.627 --> 40:30.663
TERRENCE, WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH IS NORMAL.

40:30.697 --> 40:32.866
PRETENDING
THAT IT'S NOT HAPPENING,

40:32.899 --> 40:35.502
THAT WILL MAKE IT WORSE.

40:37.637 --> 40:41.708
WHEN I WAS 5...

40:41.741 --> 40:45.578
I ALMOST DROWNED
IN THE TOWN SWIMMING POOL.

40:45.612 --> 40:49.049
IT WAS AWFUL.

40:49.082 --> 40:51.618
IT SEEMED LIKE
I WAS DOWN THERE FOREVER.

40:51.651 --> 40:54.721
AND THEN THIS HAND,
MY MOTHER'S HAND,

40:54.754 --> 40:56.756
FINALLY APPEARED, AND...

40:56.790 --> 41:00.627
ALL I NEEDED TO DO
WAS REACH OUT AND GRAB IT.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.629
BUT WHEN YOU'RE DROWNING,

41:02.662 --> 41:05.632
IT'S LIKE YOU CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

41:07.067 --> 41:10.870
SO WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO REACH FOR THAT HAND...

41:13.740 --> 41:16.810
...IT'S RIGHT HERE.

41:20.780 --> 41:22.649
NICO.

41:22.682 --> 41:25.618
JULIETTE SURFACED.
CREDIT-CARD ACTIVITY, TODAY.

41:25.652 --> 41:26.753
WHAT? WHERE?

41:26.786 --> 41:28.188
CRAZIEST THING.
SHE'S HERE.

41:28.221 --> 41:30.090
IN NEW YORK?
HERE IN THE HOTEL.

41:30.123 --> 41:32.692
ROOM 1510.

41:45.138 --> 41:48.708
JULIETTE!

41:49.843 --> 41:52.612
[ BEEPING ]

41:52.645 --> 41:53.913
JULIETTE?

41:53.947 --> 41:56.649
JULIETTE?

42:05.191 --> 42:06.926
MARSHALL?

42:06.960 --> 42:08.628
NICO.

42:08.661 --> 42:10.764
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

42:10.797 --> 42:12.966
WHERE'S JULIETTE?

42:12.999 --> 42:15.669
VACATIONING AT MY VILLA
ON BORA BORA.

42:15.702 --> 42:18.004
IT'S GOOD TO GET OFF THE GRID
EVERY SO OFTEN, DON'T YOU THINK?

42:18.938 --> 42:20.940
YOU SET ME UP.

42:20.974 --> 42:23.743
YOU WANTED ME TO THINK
SHE WAS DEAD. IS THAT IT?

42:23.777 --> 42:25.612
EVEN FOR YOU,
THAT'S TWISTED!

42:25.645 --> 42:28.682
THAT FEELING YOU HAVE
RIGHT NOW?

42:28.715 --> 42:29.649
IT'S SAME FEELING I HAD

42:29.683 --> 42:32.752
WHEN I REALIZED
YOU WERE SCREWING MY WIFE.

42:34.754 --> 42:38.224
NOW WE'RE EVEN.

42:39.826 --> 42:41.828
ALMOST.
