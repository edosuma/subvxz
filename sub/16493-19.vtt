What if no one can hear us?

But I don't want
to be your rival.

psyching anything.

How are you guys doing?

We're making a comeback.

And, there's a Lumbermax

They're called
the Lumbermax now.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.125
Well now all the good
band names are taken.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.417
Who are the Lumberzacks?

Is there some backstory
that I'm not...

It was the year 2016. [echoes]

04:01.500 --> 04:03.417
Sorry, I had the reverb up all the way.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.291
The year 2016 and the
Lumberzacks were on tour.

04:07.375 --> 04:10.792
We had been to shopping malls
all over the quad-state area.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.125
We sing together.
We danced together.

shirts together.

04:14.917 --> 04:16.125
[Zack] But the
pressure was too much.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.000
We started partying constantly.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.125
It was nonstop.

04:20.208 --> 04:23.542
Then one day,
a girl came between us.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.083
-I was standing there.
-She can stand there.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.083

Just like that,
we drove her away.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.375
So how did it end?

When I left,
they didn't take it well.

their names to Max.

04:42.542 --> 04:44.166
So?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.166
When I was the lead singer,
they never changed their names to Zack.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.291
Did you want them to?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.083
No, but that's not the point!

04:49.166 --> 04:51.000
And now they're convinced
they're gonna win.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.000
We have got to step up our game.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.625

just relax and something.

04:55.709 --> 04:56.917
I don't know what the rest was.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.166

think I'm lost without them.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.208
Wow, this is like
one of those movies

05:06.291 --> 05:07.959
where there's one dance
team from the streets

05:08.041 --> 05:09.875
and one dance team is
classically trained,

05:09.959 --> 05:11.583

to do this competition,

05:11.667 --> 05:13.333

runs out of funding,

05:13.417 --> 05:14.500
so they have to raise the money,

05:14.583 --> 05:16.208
and then the classically
trained dancer

05:16.291 --> 05:17.875
leaves the other
team and joins them

05:17.959 --> 05:20.125

value of hard work.
