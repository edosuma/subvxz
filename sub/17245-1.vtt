NARRATOR: 'Twas three
nights before Christmas
at the magical North Pole,

00:38.539 --> 00:43.844
and all the new elves
had gathered round Santa
to be given their roles.

00:43.844 --> 00:47.748
"Toy-making elf!"
Santa decreed
to the first one in line,

00:47.748 --> 00:52.853
and to the next,
and the next,
and the next 209.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.656
But when Santa came
to the last elf
standing there,

00:55.656 --> 01:00.661
something very different
he was to declare!

01:00.661 --> 01:04.331
"Stable elf!"
he proclaimed,
expecting a cheer.

01:04.331 --> 01:08.136
"You'll be the one in charge
of all things reindeer.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.471
"You'll talk to them
and make them all fly.

01:10.471 --> 01:13.374
"The sole keeper
of the magic berries

01:13.374 --> 01:16.544
"that carry them
into the sky."

01:16.544 --> 01:18.612
But a cheer
he did not receive.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.415
Nor a smile,
nor a chuckle.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.852
Instead, poor Henry's
knees started to buckle.

01:24.852 --> 01:29.123
"I don't like reindeer,"
he protested,
"Or any animal, I mean,

01:29.123 --> 01:34.528
"they slobber and shed
and are so very unclean."

01:34.528 --> 01:37.465
But Santa's mind
was made up,
that much was clear.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.401
So that night,
Henry came up
with a plan,

01:40.401 --> 01:43.171
to change his career.

01:43.171 --> 01:47.708
He would make
a toy of his own
as a secret surprise.

01:47.708 --> 01:52.313
One that will force
the big man to see
him with new eyes!

01:52.313 --> 01:56.717
But Henry's toy-making skills
were a long way from strong

01:56.717 --> 01:59.720
and before he knew it,
things went wronger
than wrong!

02:01.455 --> 02:03.857
Now, reindeer
are well-trained.

02:03.857 --> 02:07.628
They can sit,
stay and heel.

02:07.628 --> 02:11.165
But that doesn't mean
they'll pass up a free meal.

02:11.165 --> 02:14.502
Henry tried to stop
them from floating away,

02:14.502 --> 02:19.173
but only succeeded in
falling into the sleigh.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.310
It was a disaster,
a catastrophe,
a tangled mess

02:22.310 --> 02:24.678
that might never
have been unwoven,

02:24.678 --> 02:28.849
that is, were it not
for a big, sloppy dog
named Beethoven.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.963
MASON: Hot chocolate,
get your hot chocolate!

02:42.963 --> 02:44.632
It's low in fat
and 100% organic.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.935
At least... Not really.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.739

CHRISTINE: Mason!

02:54.342 --> 02:55.209
Hey, Mom.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.513
Hot chocolate?
Goes to a good cause,

02:59.513 --> 03:01.815
teenagers whose mom's
won't buy them what
they want for Christmas.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.752
Yeah, I think
I'm going to stick
with my own cause,

03:04.752 --> 03:06.687
moms who think
there are more
productive uses

03:06.687 --> 03:09.423
of teenager's time
than video games.

03:09.423 --> 03:09.957
How's it going anyway?

03:11.992 --> 03:12.960
Like Grandpa,
after the divorce.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.765
A big opportunity
just came up at work,

03:17.765 --> 03:19.833
and I'm gonna need
your help with this.

Okay, okay.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.447
Don't worry,
I think that just
means he likes you.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.849
Yeah? Well, the feeling
is definitely not mutual!

03:38.319 --> 03:39.653
What's this drool machine
doing here anyway?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.622
You don't recognize him?
This is Beethoven.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.891
He stayed in town to
star in my commercial.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.460
I need you to watch
him while I get
everything else ready.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.662
Watch him?
But, Mom, I don't
even like dogs

03:48.662 --> 03:51.031
and it's Christmas break,
I got my own stuff to do.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.934
Can we talk about this later?
I really have a lot
I've got to get done.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.537
Yeah, whatever.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.338
Okay!

03:58.606 --> 04:01.409
Here is his bed.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.913
It's in his contract,
he has to have it handy
anytime he needs it.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.981
Mom, really,
I'm working here,

04:07.981 --> 04:08.849

Christmas gift.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.517

Beethoven?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.553

something to do with
reindeer, Santa's sleigh,

probably never allowed
in the North Pole again.

this opportunity.

to tell you,

10:22.656 --> 10:25.425
that I have another
possible promotional
opportunity for Beethoven.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.127
What are you
talking about?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.696
Well, I spoke with
the mayor this morning.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.332
He told me that the town
Christmas parade this year
is going to be televised.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.401
Anyway, he wants Beethoven
to be the Grand Marshal
of the parade.

opportunity, for the firm

expected home.

Don't you worry
about that.

pretty much guarantee
that promotion is yours.

Look. Hey, I need your
help all right? Okay?

anyone else here

know where "here" is!

really upset if I don't...

team of them.

Ha! See, your
dog believes me.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.763
He must've saw me
fall out of the sleigh,
didn't you, boy?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.198
Where did they
get him?

12:11.198 --> 12:13.166
What if I can prove
that I can understand

12:13.166 --> 12:15.936
what this drool
machine is saying?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.270
How are you gonna do that?

12:17.270 --> 12:18.238
By talking to him.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.974
All right.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.177
Let's see what
we have here. Okay.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.464
Talk about dog breath.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.170
All right,
so, Beethoven,

12:50.170 --> 12:53.406
tell me something
about Mason that
only you would know.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.181
Okay, I'll play along,
but you're crazier
than a calico on catnip

13:01.181 --> 13:03.550
if you really think you're
gonna be able to understand
what I'm saying!

13:03.550 --> 13:05.152
I can understand you
perfectly, Beethoven.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.419
You're kidding me, right?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.822
Wait, wait, wait.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.091
Am I on that Animal
Planet show where they
play pranks on stupid...

13:11.091 --> 13:14.294
No, no! You're not on
any show, Beethoven.
All right?

13:14.294 --> 13:17.464
Just tell me something
about Mason, will you?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.901
Okay, okay. I've only
been talking to people
for about 30 seconds,

13:20.901 --> 13:21.969
so sorry if I'm
a little distracted!

13:24.004 --> 13:25.338
By the way, you wouldn't
happen to have any

13:25.338 --> 13:26.539

on you, would you?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.608
Beethoven!

13:28.608 --> 13:31.444
Sorry, sorry.
Okay, something
about Mason.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.413
Hmm.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.382
I don't know too
much about him,
but here goes.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.350
(BARKING)

13:42.255 --> 13:44.191
That's a little exploitive.

13:44.191 --> 13:48.628
Okay. What did he say?

13:48.628 --> 13:53.133
(SCOFFS) Only that you
were selling his picture
without his permission

13:53.133 --> 13:55.502

Paid in bones, of course.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.142
So, you're telling me

14:03.510 --> 14:04.377
there really is
a Santa Claus?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.379
Uh, duh.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.216
Not just some dopes
who act out a fantasy
for little kids every year?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.051
That's right.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.286
And you're a bonafide
Christmas elf?

who just got out
of the nuthouse.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.858
Tell you what,
just call me Henry.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.630
This is surreal.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.168
His jacket
totally clashes
with his knickers.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.537
Totally!

14:30.537 --> 14:32.906
Come on, you got
to let me try it.
No!

14:32.906 --> 14:37.144
No, I am sorry, man.
That's one thing
Santa is very clear on.

14:37.144 --> 14:41.381
Christmas magic is
not to be used outside
any non-North Pole employee.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.183
Something to do with,
like, liability

14:43.183 --> 14:44.684
or insurance,
something like that.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.087
Look, forget that.
We have bigger problems,
all right?

14:47.087 --> 14:51.224
If I don't find Santa's
toy bag before 12:00
on Christmas Eve,

14:51.224 --> 14:54.928
then he won't have enough
time to deliver the presents
on Christmas morning!

14:54.928 --> 14:58.231
And then I'll get
stripped of my bells.

I can't believe it.
All the other stores
are sold out!

Is this right?
$99.99?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.268
Why, yes! I just
priced it myself.

supposed to be more

16:09.069 --> 16:11.038

are you wearing?

16:11.038 --> 16:13.540
It's an elf costume.
Like they wear
at the North Pole.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.575
I know it's
an elf costume,
half-wit.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.411
What I want to know
is why are you
wearing it?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.147
I thought it would
help with business.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.415
You know that
cell phone store
down the street?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.585
They've got a guy
out front dressed
as a cell phone.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.655
Only it's Christmas
and we don't sell
cell phones.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.722
So I figured...

16:29.722 --> 16:31.291
Ow! Ah!

Shut up. First of all,
you're an idiot.

Second of all,
you're an idiot.

Third of all, look around.
Business is doing just fine.

16:38.765 --> 16:44.204

be my best scam since

all over for you.

get another dog?

39:31.703 --> 39:33.872
What? Oh.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.107
No, I didn't. It's just
a stray that won't
stop following me.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.043
A stray? Well,
what's a stray?

39:38.043 --> 39:39.878
What? Don't you guys have
strays in the North Pole?

39:39.878 --> 39:42.648
They are these dogs...

39:42.648 --> 39:44.983
Actually, forget it.
Just tell me.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.952
Did you guys find
the toy bag or not?

39:46.952 --> 39:49.187
We tracked down
the guy who has the bag,

39:49.187 --> 39:51.690
but it seems
he doesn't really
want to give it up.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.159
Does that mean you
actually saw his face?

39:54.159 --> 39:57.195
'Cause then maybe we
can get a description.
This is a pretty small town.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.897
Maybe I can recognize him.

get a good look.

just ridiculous.

up a magic toy bag.

He barked at me.

What was that?
I got a good look at him.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.988

I want to hit you with.

Good. You just float
'em right on by me.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.867
Well, since Beethoven's
a big movie star,

41:08.867 --> 41:11.169
I was thinking put him
on a Hollywood-themed float.

with flavors of
Christmas naturally.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.974

my mind's eye.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.078

41:22.881 --> 41:25.150
Or I was thinking,
flash bulbs and
sprigs of holly.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.686
Oh, that's even better.

41:28.820 --> 41:29.688
That's a great idea.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.691

Great.

41:33.692 --> 41:34.259
Only one problem.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.765

Excuse me?

41:39.765 --> 41:41.667
That's right, Cooper.
I wanna do something
that we've never done before.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.969
I want a win-win-win.

get the third win?

You want chipmunks
to be watching?

41:54.880 --> 41:56.648
Well, no, that's
just an expression.

I really don't
think it is.

is press-release that float

never press-released
anything before.

You get it out to
all the major outlets

word it just properly

49:52.257 --> 49:53.658
STRAY: Watch it.

49:53.658 --> 49:55.560
My mom's model!
Henry, what did you do?

49:55.560 --> 49:57.128
We didn't do anything.

49:57.128 --> 49:57.528
Just get out of here.
I'll handle it.

50:10.375 --> 50:13.010
Mason! Mason,
is something on fire?

50:15.246 --> 50:16.381
Uh...

50:16.381 --> 50:17.248
Oops.

50:21.686 --> 50:23.554
Really, Mom,
I didn't mean
to do it.

50:23.554 --> 50:25.623
Really, then what
were you doing
in the garage

50:25.623 --> 50:28.626
when I specifically
told you not to
go in there?

50:28.626 --> 50:31.629
And don't bother telling me
that my Christmas present
was out there this time.

50:31.629 --> 50:34.332
Okay. Look,
I was out there,

50:34.332 --> 50:36.101
because that Christmas elf
that I brought home yesterday

50:36.101 --> 50:37.235
was here with Beethoven.

50:37.235 --> 50:38.569
Mason, this again?

50:38.569 --> 50:39.637
Mom, it's true.

50:39.637 --> 50:41.339
It's not true.

50:41.339 --> 50:43.774
Now I'm sorry
that I have to
work so much,

50:43.774 --> 50:46.511
but punishing me
for that isn't going to
make things any easier

50:46.511 --> 50:47.678
on either one of us.
Do you understand?

50:47.678 --> 50:50.315
I'm not punishing you.

50:50.315 --> 50:52.383
You know what, Mason?
I don't have time
for this conversation

50:52.383 --> 50:54.619
because thanks to you,
I have a press
release to write

50:54.619 --> 50:57.755
and an entire model
to rebuild before
tomorrow morning.

51:02.360 --> 51:05.296
I'm sorry to do
this to you this week,
but you're grounded.

51:05.296 --> 51:06.864
Means you're not going
to be leaving the house
until New Year's.

51:06.864 --> 51:09.567
What? I'm grounded?

51:09.567 --> 51:10.868
I don't know
what you thought
would happen,

51:10.868 --> 51:12.437
you could've burned
the whole house down.

51:14.839 --> 51:16.141
Well, Merry Christmas to me.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.119
(HENRY LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

51:28.119 --> 51:30.087
Hey, sorry. Um...

51:31.889 --> 51:33.524
Was that my fault?

51:33.524 --> 51:35.193
Was that your fault?

51:35.193 --> 51:37.795
Oh, boy.
Oh, here we go.

51:37.795 --> 51:40.631
Let's see.
Did you stupidly
and irresponsibly

51:40.631 --> 51:42.467
lose the toy bag?
Yes.

51:42.467 --> 51:45.270
Did you idiotically
land in that tree and
intrude on all our lives?

51:45.270 --> 51:47.138
Yes.
Did you moronically set fire

51:47.138 --> 51:49.207
to my mother's float model?
Yes.

51:49.207 --> 51:50.841
Yes, it was your fault.

51:51.809 --> 51:52.677
I just don't see it.

51:52.677 --> 51:53.578
Oh!

51:55.780 --> 51:57.315
What a dumb elf!

51:57.315 --> 51:59.150
You know what?

51:59.150 --> 52:00.218
Never mind.
Don't worry
about it.

52:01.919 --> 52:03.921
Just please tell
me that you got
a good sketch.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.391
Oh, actually, we just
finished it. Yeah.

52:07.192 --> 52:08.626
(HENRY LAUGHS)

52:08.626 --> 52:11.429
Yeah, little guy
over there, he's got
quite some memory.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.231
Don't you?
Yes, you do.

52:13.231 --> 52:15.800
All right.
So, check it out.

52:15.800 --> 52:16.534
Do you recognize him?

52:20.305 --> 52:22.340
Actually, no.

52:22.340 --> 52:25.743
What? This is great.

52:25.743 --> 52:28.579
I make one mistake,
one mistake,
and all this happens.

52:37.322 --> 52:38.923
"One little mistake."
What does that mean?

52:38.923 --> 52:41.659
Look, at this point,
I might as well just
tell you the truth.

52:44.362 --> 52:46.764
I'm not really
a toy-making elf.

52:48.866 --> 52:50.201
You're not?

52:51.736 --> 52:52.637
No.

52:54.339 --> 52:57.508
I'm a stable elf.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.710
And the whole reason
I'm here is because
I was trying not to be.

53:01.312 --> 53:02.513
Doesn't matter.

53:03.681 --> 53:06.884
After this disaster,

53:06.884 --> 53:09.620
I'll be lucky
if Santa lets me
be an elf at all.

53:09.620 --> 53:12.257
But wait,
I don't get it.

53:12.257 --> 53:13.424
Why don't you
wanna be a stable elf?

53:15.626 --> 53:18.496
All of my other elf buddies,
they're all making toys.

53:20.865 --> 53:21.966
And I'm just different.

53:24.735 --> 53:27.505
What's so bad about
being different?

53:27.505 --> 53:30.275
Anyone can buy
a toy from a store,

53:30.275 --> 53:31.576
but being the one elf
who can talk to animals,

53:33.411 --> 53:35.413
and help with Santa's
magic reindeer?

53:38.849 --> 53:40.651
That seems
pretty cool
to me.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.871
Hey, you can't sleep there.

54:03.841 --> 54:04.842
Okay, I got to admit.
You're kind of cute.

54:06.043 --> 54:08.479
And you look pretty comfy.

54:08.479 --> 54:11.316
Don't get used to it, okay?

54:11.316 --> 54:13.884
I meant what
I said yesterday.
You can't stay here.

54:16.487 --> 54:17.955
(WHINING)

54:35.973 --> 54:38.008
HENRY: That's right, Santa.

54:38.008 --> 54:41.512
You won't be able to
deliver any presents
because of me. Right?

54:43.748 --> 54:45.015
There's always
next year, right?

54:47.652 --> 54:50.355
Who am I kidding?
It's Coal City for me.

54:51.689 --> 54:54.492
Hey, don't beat
yourself up, H-man.

54:54.492 --> 54:57.362
You're still
the coolest elf
I've ever met.

54:57.362 --> 55:01.632
Of course,
you're the only
elf I've ever met,

55:01.632 --> 55:03.067
but you shouldn't
let that affect
the compliment.

55:03.067 --> 55:05.736
Well, thank you, Beethoven.

55:05.736 --> 55:09.340
Hey. If there were
more animals like you
at the North Pole,

55:09.340 --> 55:12.443
I would be happy
to be a stable elf.

55:12.443 --> 55:15.880
Oh, really? Come here.
Give me some sugar.

55:18.916 --> 55:20.951
You still got to stop
doing that though.

55:21.619 --> 55:22.487
(GROANS)

55:24.522 --> 55:27.625
You got to get used to it.
It's a real show of
affection in the dog world.

55:27.625 --> 55:29.093
We dogs love to lick.

55:30.695 --> 55:32.363
SMIRCH: Ho, ho, ho

55:32.363 --> 55:33.831
KENNY: Ho, ho, ho

55:33.831 --> 55:35.466
Ho, ho, ho

55:35.466 --> 55:36.401
(BARKING)

55:40.705 --> 55:41.939
Quiet! You'll wake up my mom.

55:43.408 --> 55:44.909
Visit me, Sylvester Smirch

55:46.043 --> 55:47.678
It's him.
It's him.

55:47.678 --> 55:49.079
No, no, no, no,
he's saying that

55:49.079 --> 55:51.782
that's the guy that
stole Santa's toy bag.

55:53.083 --> 55:54.719
Where all the hottest toys...

55:54.719 --> 55:56.954
Will be in stock.

55:56.954 --> 56:00.090
That's right.
It's almost as if we
have an endless supply.

56:01.058 --> 56:03.027
Oh! Oh!

56:03.027 --> 56:06.764
That's Santa's toy bag.
We found it. Yes.

56:06.764 --> 56:09.400
Good work, guys.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.435
Rub my belly.
Rub my belly.

56:11.902 --> 56:13.037
Hey, calm down, elf.

56:19.977 --> 56:22.580
Come on, big fella,
move those big bones.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.949
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Hold on to your whiskers.

56:29.687 --> 56:33.658
Okay. So my mom would kill
me if I left the house
while I was grounded.

56:33.658 --> 56:35.726
So, you guys
are gonna take
this one yourself.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.728
No problemo.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.196
You know, I'm thinking
these two fur balls

56:39.196 --> 56:40.197
can handle it
all by themselves.

56:40.197 --> 56:40.898
You got that right, elf.

56:42.066 --> 56:43.534
STRAY: On our way.

56:43.534 --> 56:44.735
Operation Red Bag,
here we come.

56:46.671 --> 56:48.005
SMIRCH ON PA:
Merry Christmas, shoppers.

56:48.005 --> 56:50.007
Sylvester Smirch here.

56:50.007 --> 56:53.778
Welcome to Most Wanted Toys.

56:53.778 --> 56:56.647
Don't forget to
stop by the Shop
Till You Drop Corner

56:56.647 --> 56:59.216
for the hottest
and most wanted toys.

56:59.216 --> 57:02.587
These prices,
ridiculous.
Ridiculous!

57:02.587 --> 57:05.222
But I've been to every
other store in town,
they're all sold out.

57:05.222 --> 57:07.191
This guy really
does seem to have
an endless supply.

57:09.860 --> 57:15.165
Everyone, wait. Okay?
You guys cannot
buy these toys.

57:15.165 --> 57:19.203
These toys are supposed
to be going to kids
all around the world.

57:19.203 --> 57:21.138
What are you talking about?

57:21.138 --> 57:23.541
What I'm talking about
is these toys are stolen.

57:23.541 --> 57:24.875
(ALL GASP)

57:24.875 --> 57:28.212
That's right.
These toys do not belong
to the owner of this store.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.481
Elf trouble.

57:30.481 --> 57:31.248
You're saying these
toys are stolen?

57:31.248 --> 57:32.683
They are stolen

57:32.683 --> 57:35.620
directly from
Santa himself.

57:35.620 --> 57:39.524
That's right, everyone.
The prices are so low,

57:39.524 --> 57:42.092
it's as if these
toys are stolen
from Santa himself.

57:43.728 --> 57:45.195
(LAUGHING) Just a little
viral marketing, folks!

57:45.195 --> 57:46.564
That concludes
our 12:00 show.

57:47.598 --> 57:49.166
Great show.

57:49.166 --> 57:51.969
There will be
additional performances
throughout the day.

57:51.969 --> 57:53.237
What are you
talking about,
Smirch?

57:53.237 --> 57:56.807
Uh, folks,
please ignore Binky,
the drunken elf here.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.577
He's had a little
too much eggnog
this morning.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.646
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

58:01.646 --> 58:03.748
Kenny, rip these
nice people off.

58:03.748 --> 58:05.983
I mean, ring these
nice people up.
I'll be right back.

58:05.983 --> 58:08.018
Get out.

58:08.018 --> 58:10.120
Hey, you listen
to me, all right?

58:10.120 --> 58:14.024
I'm not leaving here
without Santa's toy bag.

58:14.024 --> 58:17.261
If you're not gone in
the next three minutes,
I'm gonna call the police.

58:17.261 --> 58:19.897
And who do you think
they're going to believe?

58:19.897 --> 58:23.200
A taxpaying merchant
with a lease and a permit

58:23.200 --> 58:26.236
or little Mr. Fancy Pants
and his mangy-mutt parade?

58:26.236 --> 58:27.171
Hey!

58:32.777 --> 58:33.978
Chop-chop. Let's shop.

58:36.213 --> 58:37.181
(GROANS)

58:39.249 --> 58:42.887
All right. We have
to get back in there.

58:42.887 --> 58:44.088
I wonder if they sell
chewy toys in there.

58:46.757 --> 58:48.959
HENRY: Hey. You see
that small window
in the back?

58:48.959 --> 58:50.294
All right, here's the plan.

58:50.294 --> 58:53.097
I can create
a diversion
out here

58:53.097 --> 58:56.066
and you guys
can sneak around
and grab the bag.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.134
I think I can handle that.
HENRY: But...

58:58.569 --> 59:00.037
How am I gonna do that?

59:02.006 --> 59:03.140
Hey, elf.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.575
Not now, Beethoven.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.677
Can't you hear that music?

59:06.677 --> 59:08.679
Beethoven,
seriously,
all right?

59:08.679 --> 59:10.948
This is no time
for music, okay?

59:10.948 --> 59:12.082
We're trying to
think of a plan here.

59:12.082 --> 59:14.284
Music is the plan, silly.

59:14.284 --> 59:16.286
What do you mean,
"Music is the plan"?

59:16.286 --> 59:18.022
Come on, elf.
Get moving.

59:18.022 --> 59:19.590
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

59:21.859 --> 59:24.995
(SINGING JINGLE BELLS)

59:24.995 --> 59:26.296
BEETHOVEN: Now, go.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

59:26.296 --> 59:27.965
Whoa! Whoa!

59:27.965 --> 59:30.200
All right,
they call you Beethoven
for a reason, huh?

59:33.237 --> 59:34.338
BEETHOVEN: Come on.
Let's go, little guy.

59:34.338 --> 59:35.773
Right behind you.

59:35.773 --> 59:37.007
(CONTINUE SINGING)

59:40.911 --> 59:44.782
Hey, hey. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Hey, hey.

59:44.782 --> 59:48.719
Um, I'm new in town
and I would love to be
a part of your group.

59:48.719 --> 59:50.888
Dude, do you ever wear
your regular clothes?

59:52.389 --> 59:53.791
Who are you anyway?

59:53.791 --> 59:55.693
The name's Presley.

59:55.693 --> 59:57.094
Elfis Presley.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:03.033
Anyways, um, would you
guys be interested in
taking a new member?

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:05.670
Uh, not really.

01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:07.004
Oh, come on.
Please. Please. Please.

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:08.673
Easy, Presley,

01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:10.841
don't get your
bells in a bunch.

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:13.077
Just stay in tune.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:14.311
Don't frighten
anyone, capisce?

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.413
Yeah.

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.182
(SINGING CONTINUES)

01:00:21.819 --> 01:00:23.320
Here you go,
three more.

01:00:25.656 --> 01:00:28.759
Oh, boy. Christmas carolers.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.027
Don't even
think about it.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:35.165
Just one song.
I mean, everybody loves
Christmas music, right?

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:39.269
Wrong. Besides,

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.305
it's probably just
another trick by
that irritating elf.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.408
(SCOFFS)

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:49.980
Come on!
An entire crowd of
Christmas carolers?

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.218
I'll make you a deal,
we get to listen to
one Christmas carol

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:56.353
and you don't have
to buy me a Christmas
present this year.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.056
I wasn't going to
get you a Christmas
present anyway.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:03.894
Oh, please, boss,
with candy canes
on top. Come on.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.662
I just want to hear
the Christmas carolers!

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:10.067
Oh, all right.
If it'll shut you up.

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:10.868
It will.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.282
No, no, no, boss.

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:26.150
One song.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:28.685
For the memories.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.793
(SNIFFING) Good thing I'm
comfortable around garbage.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.732
I am in hell.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.012
I wonder if this is
considered barking
and entering.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.025
BEETHOVEN:
Come on. Let me in.

01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:14.131
What are you
waiting for?

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:16.533
I'm freezing
my jingle bells
off out here.

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.102
December is all
work and no play

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:23.007
...hours of an
average working day

01:02:23.007 --> 01:02:28.145
I'll try to make it
through Christmas day

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:28.913
(HENRY LAUGHS)

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:33.784
Wait a second.
Those aren't the lyrics.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:36.854
Oh, what?

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:38.088
You don't know that verse?
SMIRCH: Hey!

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.423
It's that insane elf.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:41.325
Where?

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.459
Well, then, where is...

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:44.528
Santa's bag!

01:02:46.396 --> 01:02:47.131
Get back here with that.

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:49.533
HENRY: Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me!

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:52.202
Hold this.

01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:55.105
Let go.
(GROWLING)

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:58.142
Give me that!

01:02:58.142 --> 01:03:00.477
Give it to me,
you bloated flea bag!

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:01.478
(SCREAMS)

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:02.779
Mommy!

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:06.951
Good boy, Beethoven.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:08.886
I'll take it from here.
(BEETHOVEN BARKING)

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.420
No!

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.290
I got it.
I actually
got it!

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:17.561
(GROANING)

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:21.131
SMIRCH: Officer.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.299
I'd like to report
a robbery

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.936
and a canine assault.

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:29.006
Listen, all right?
I am not the one who
stole the toy bag, okay?

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.941
It was him.
It was that guy
right there.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:34.344
Uh-huh. Tell it
to the judge,
Christmas elf.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:37.514
In the mean time,
you have the right
to remain silent.

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.416
CAROLERS:
Silent night
Holy night

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:41.585
All is calm
All is bright

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.553
Cram it, carolers.

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.355
How rude!

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:45.990
(CAROLERS VOICE DISGUST)

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.159
All right,
get in the cruiser.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.527
HENRY:
Wait, no! Stop it!

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:57.101
(PANTING)

01:03:57.101 --> 01:03:58.068
You take that stray
to the shelter.
(WHIMPERS)

01:03:58.068 --> 01:03:59.937
Tata.

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:02.873
Mr. Smirch, I'll meet you
back at the police station.
You stay there.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:04.942
No.
Thank you, Officer.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:09.313
No, you are a grumpy,
grouchy, evil person.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:14.518
They made me do it.

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:18.188
(SIREN WAILING)

01:04:51.956 --> 01:04:55.559
Uh, just needs more
Christmas stuff.

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.027
You know, like,
do you think
we can get

01:04:57.027 --> 01:04:58.462
some of those big
Christmas balls?

01:04:58.462 --> 01:05:00.230
Christmas balls?
Yeah.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.300
You know, those big,
colorful ornament balls?

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.503
Oh, and some sprigs
of holly, you know,
for Holly-wood?

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.638
Big Christmas balls
and sprigs of holly?

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.707
Sure, I'll rustle
some up right now.

(SIREN WAILING)

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.246
Wonder what's going on.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.647
I heard some nut

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:20.484
dressed like a Christmas
elf got arrested for
robbing a toy store.

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:21.251
REXFORD: Christine?

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:24.488
This is our float?

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:27.324
CHRISTINE:
Hi, Mr. Rexford. Yes.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:29.726
Um, listen, I know
it's a little different
from what we discussed,

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:31.661
but there were
some problems
with the model,

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.363
so we had to make
a few small changes.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:35.065
Problem with the model?
What sort of problem?

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.368
Uh, it's kind of
a long story.

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:39.603
Don't you worry,
float's gonna be great.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.272
Needs balls.
Excuse me?

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.408
You know, those big,
colorful ornament balls.

01:05:45.242 --> 01:05:47.077
You have some of those?

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:49.046
Of course,
Mr. Rexford.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:51.315
And how about
some little wrapped
presents, too?

01:05:51.315 --> 01:05:52.716
I mean, for heaven's
sakes, that's what
Christmas is about,

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:55.119
glitz and glamour
and presents.

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.254
Lots and lots
of presents.

Oh, man, I wish
I could understand you.

Hey, Mason.
Mom, I need to talk
to you about something.

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:32.789
What? What's wrong?
It's the elf. I...

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:35.025
I think he may
be in trouble.
Let me guess.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:36.360
Your little elf friend
knocked over a toy store

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.296
and now you want
me to post bail?

01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.531
No, Mom, listen.
There's really
something wrong.

We are not having
this conversation,
Mason,

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:46.336
because I need
to get Beethoven
ready for the parade.

(BARKING)
Oh!

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:53.210
See, Mom? Even Beethoven
is trying to tell
you something.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.644
Can't you just put
your stupid job aside

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:56.113
for one second and
just listen to me?

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:57.281
I do listen to you, Mason.

01:06:57.281 --> 01:06:59.483
No, you don't.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.385
Ever since Dad died
it's like you barely pay
attention to me at all.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.254
It's like you died, too.

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:06.623
And you know what?
If Dad was here,

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.025
he'd listen to me.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.128

to you for?
You can't talk.

I don't want a candy cane
right now, Beethoven.

Okay.

Okay. Okay,

it's time for you

to get your nose
out of your butt

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:41.850

the truth,

over it already.

all right?

You know, from that real
Christmas elf who's
living in your garage?

of tricks out there.

back to Santa in time,

we better get going.

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:48.752
I am so sorry
if I haven't been
there for you.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:53.823
After your dad died,
I was just so scared,
you know?

01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:55.892
Scared of what?

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.597
Not being able to
be a mom and a dad.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.735
I guess by trying to be both,
I stopped being either.

Well, I'm sorry, too.

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:14.311
Because I didn't
think about how
hard it was for you.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.814
I'll try to remember
that next time

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:19.749
you need me to help
you out with something.

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:23.987
But hey,

01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:24.921
it's always hardest around
the holidays, right?

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:29.793
Yeah, that's right.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.865
All right.

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.402
Let's get going.
What are we waiting for?

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:40.604
Beethoven told me that
your little elf friend
really is in jail.

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:42.739
Jail?

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:45.442
You're not gonna
get away with this,
whoever you are.

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:48.312
And when Santa finds
out who you are,

01:10:48.312 --> 01:10:52.048
oh, you are gonna be in
so much trouble, mister.

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:55.319
I am talking
"naughty list"
for life.

01:10:55.319 --> 01:10:57.287
I want to press charges.

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.889
I want to throw
the book at him,
or Kindle.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:01.958
Whatever's available.
Hey!

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.693
Will you just give
me the bag back?

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:05.295
Look, where is your
Christmas spirit?

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:06.896
So, are we done here?

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:09.399
Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Smirch.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:10.033
Merry Christmas.
What?

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:11.935
Oh. Uh...

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.903
Ditto.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.439
Can you at least
give it back when
it runs out?

01:11:18.342 --> 01:11:20.544
What did you say?

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:23.380
The bag, will you
consider giving
it back to me

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.914
after the toys run out?

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:26.383
Uh...

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:29.453
I'll just humor
him, you know.

01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:31.821
Perhaps he'll slip
up and say something
we can use against him.

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.596
What's this all
about, elfy?

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:42.699
When exactly will
the bag run out?

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:45.769
I don't know.
But at the rate you're
going, probably soon.

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:48.004
The elves only
made enough toys
for one year.

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:49.072
Only made enough?

all those toys.

What? You have?
Yes.

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:03.119
After all
it is Christmas.

01:12:03.119 --> 01:12:04.888
In fact, I think
I'd like to offer

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:07.691
this strangely dressed
young fellow a ride home.

Elf.
Sorry, he's already gone.

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.746
That guy who
owns the toy store

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.748
decided not to press
charges after all.

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:33.850
Even gave him
a ride home, too.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:34.183
Mom, he's got to
be up to something.

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:36.886
Let's go.

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:39.856
Beethoven says, "Yes."
I know.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:43.627
I don't get it, boss.
Why are we leaving again?

01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:45.695
Because now that
we have the elf,

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.498
we have all we'll ever
need to make money for
the rest of our lives.

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:49.833
No, no, no, no.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:52.869
I don't actually
know how to make toys.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:56.440
I explained this to you.
This is just a costume.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.741
I picked it up at
the Halloween store...

01:12:57.741 --> 01:13:00.410
I'm not talking about you.

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.146
I am talking
about this elf.

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.915
This real Christmas elf.
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:07.484
You're saying that's
a real Christmas elf?

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.554
No wonder his
costume is so good.

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:12.889
But wait.
We're kidnapping him?

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.157
Yes. Don't you see?

01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:17.461
He is even better
than the bag.

01:13:17.461 --> 01:13:18.962
That is going
to run out.

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:22.632
But he will be able to
make us all the inventory
we'll ever need forever.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.935
Kenny,

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:28.805
give a man a bowl
of rice and you
feed him for a day.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:31.908
But give him an elf
who can make rice

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:35.445
and then we steal
the elf, we eat forever.

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:39.616
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know how
to make toys, okay?

01:13:39.616 --> 01:13:42.085
The one time I tried,
it was a disaster.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:44.220
Right. A Christmas elf
who does not know
how to make toys.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.755
That's a good one.

01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:53.597

But, boss, if that's
a real Christmas elf,

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:07.210
then that must be
Santa's actual
magic toy bag.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.646
Boss, this isn't right.
We shouldn't be doing this.

haven't I always
steered you right?

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.342
then they can
make a dog fly.
(BEETHOVEN BARKS)

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:10.253
Well, so long, Mason.

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:13.756
I just want to
thank you so much

01:23:13.756 --> 01:23:14.590
for helping me find
Santa's toy bag.

01:23:16.192 --> 01:23:18.794
Couldn't have done
it without you, man.

01:23:18.794 --> 01:23:21.097
And I wanna thank you
for something else, too.

01:23:21.097 --> 01:23:21.630
What's that?

01:23:22.365 --> 01:23:23.332
(SIGHS)

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:29.438
For helping me see that
Santa was right about me.

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:33.142
You know,
I am a stable elf.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:37.280
And different or not,

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:41.384
I wouldn't wanna
be anything else.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:46.189
No problem, Henry.

01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:47.523
And I guess
I should thank you
for something, too.

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:50.359
Thanks for
making me realize

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:53.028
that believing
in Santa Claus

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:54.130
is definitely not
a little kid thing.

01:23:58.601 --> 01:23:59.802
I am gonna need some
time for the tooth fairy
and Easter Bunny, though.

01:24:02.738 --> 01:24:04.640
Yeah, all right.

01:24:09.345 --> 01:24:11.680
Merry Christmas.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.549
All right.
Merry Christmas.
(STRAY LAUGHS)

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:14.483
You ready, Beethoven?

01:24:16.119 --> 01:24:16.785
Onward.

01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:20.723
(LAUGHING)
STRAY: Goodbye, big fella.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.291
Goodbye!
Merry Christmas.

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:23.259
CHRISTINE:
Merry Christmas.

01:24:23.259 --> 01:24:24.860
(LAUGHING)

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:26.795
CHRISTINE:
Bye, Beethoven.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:27.630
BEETHOVEN: Hold on.

01:24:31.234 --> 01:24:32.601
Coming home,
here we go.

01:24:32.601 --> 01:24:33.602
MASON: See you
later, Beethoven.

01:24:33.602 --> 01:24:35.238
Merry Christmas, guys.

01:24:35.238 --> 01:24:36.305
BEETHOVEN: Merry Christmas.

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.310
So what are you
gonna name him?

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:45.148
I think I'm gonna
name him after someone

01:24:45.148 --> 01:24:47.416
who really helped us
out this Christmas.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:50.553
Hey, what do you think
of the name Henry
or Hank for short?

01:24:55.724 --> 01:24:56.492
BEETHOVEN: So long.

01:24:57.826 --> 01:25:00.463
HENRY: (LAUGHING)
Merry Christmas!

01:25:08.504 --> 01:25:11.540
NARRATOR: In the end,
Santa made all
his deliveries,

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.677
and the holiday
hit no further snag.

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:17.380
Though it's important
to point out

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.815
that the best gifts
received that year

01:25:19.815 --> 01:25:22.685
came not from his bag.

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:25.288
For little Hank,
it was a home,

01:25:25.288 --> 01:25:28.257
and a happy one at that.

01:25:28.257 --> 01:25:32.861
For Henry, it was
a calling he would
never give back.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:37.533
For Christine and Mason,
it was something
enduring and true,

01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:42.371
the gift of a healing
that was long overdue.

01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:44.240
And as for our old
friend Beethoven,

01:25:45.708 --> 01:25:50.846
it was the thanks of
one very grateful elf.

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:53.616
As well as
a special
ride home

01:25:53.616 --> 01:25:55.451
from the big man himself.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:08.624
Merry Christmas,
one and all.

01:27:08.624 --> 01:27:10.926
Humanity has been saved!

01:27:10.926 --> 01:27:13.829
A helpless child's
ski-board is now
back in his arms.

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:17.633
Oh, joy! Oh, rapture!
Merry Christmas!

01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:18.401
(EXCLAIMS)

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:25.007
I was wrong again!
People are crooks!

01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:27.843
They took my
new ski-board!

01:27:27.843 --> 01:27:29.845
Oh, the inhumanity
of it all!
