WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:03.116
- Previously on "The Catch"...
- Felicity... she's a liar.

00:03.119 --> 00:04.451
I'm not afraid of Felicity.

00:04.487 --> 00:05.487
Well, you should be.

00:05.521 --> 00:07.021
Felicity was our top assassin.

00:08.691 --> 00:09.923
You're coming with me.

00:09.959 --> 00:11.458
I want to put you on retainer.

00:11.494 --> 00:13.427
- He's trying to own you.
- We're done talking about this.

00:13.429 --> 00:15.295
- She deserves better.
- You mean better than me.

00:15.297 --> 00:17.597
- Val and I are going to accept his offer.
- Allie...

00:17.633 --> 00:20.266
Working for Ethan would
solve all of AVI's problems.

00:20.302 --> 00:22.235
You and I shouldn't work together.

00:22.271 --> 00:23.604
Because I'm still in love with you.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.238
We have to save Ethan Ward.

00:25.274 --> 00:27.207
Someone in your company
is defrauding investors

00:27.243 --> 00:28.308
and laundering a lot of money.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.510
The money you've been laundering...

00:29.512 --> 00:30.711
It has to come from somewhere.

00:30.713 --> 00:31.713
There's a trust.

00:31.747 --> 00:33.078
What's the name of the trust?

00:33.081 --> 00:34.914
It's a Carly Simon song...

00:34.950 --> 00:36.316
The Mockingbird Trust.

00:36.352 --> 00:37.851
Matthew Keegan.

00:37.887 --> 00:40.320
He runs 12 clubs and
restaurants in the city.

00:40.356 --> 00:42.188
I already made a deal with someone else.

00:42.224 --> 00:44.224
All I know is he goes
by some code name...

00:44.260 --> 00:45.358
"Mockingbird."

00:45.394 --> 00:49.196
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Ms. Bishop.

00:52.468 --> 00:54.868
What shall I call you? Surely not...

00:54.904 --> 00:57.204
No, Mockingbird will be just fine.

00:59.141 --> 01:02.509
You're a difficult man to
get in touch with, Mr. Bird.

01:02.545 --> 01:05.111
Yeah, when you make yourself
too available, then, you know,

01:05.147 --> 01:07.881
people tend to bother you
with every little detail.

01:07.917 --> 01:11.251
And this way, if a problem, you know,

01:11.287 --> 01:15.488
comes across my desk...
Say, news that my product

01:15.524 --> 01:17.857
has been hijacked from my territory...

01:17.893 --> 01:19.359
Keegan's clubs were my territory,

01:19.395 --> 01:20.861
so we were finalizing our negotiations.

01:20.863 --> 01:23.863
Well, you weren't
finalizing them fast enough.

01:23.899 --> 01:25.565
Listen to me, whatever your name is.

01:25.601 --> 01:27.681
You're new in town, so I'm
willing to cut you a deal.

01:27.703 --> 01:29.335
I will...

01:29.371 --> 01:30.870
I will return your product to you,

01:30.906 --> 01:33.540
and you will return Keegan's clubs to me

01:33.576 --> 01:35.909
after which you will stay out

01:35.945 --> 01:38.078
of my business arrangements, or else.

01:38.114 --> 01:40.413
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm so... I'm sorry.

01:40.449 --> 01:44.017
Just... I have to ask... or else what?

01:44.053 --> 01:46.252
Or else I have 150 men at my disposal

01:46.288 --> 01:48.755
who will make your business
extremely hard to conduct.

01:48.791 --> 01:51.758
I hope that you don't
mean Taggart's crew.

01:51.794 --> 01:52.725
Why not?

01:52.761 --> 01:55.862
Because Taggart's crew are mine now.

01:55.898 --> 01:59.399
I've also struck up
friendships with the Shives,

01:59.435 --> 02:01.401
the Gullahorns, and the Petersons.

02:01.437 --> 02:02.769
I'm new in town.

02:02.805 --> 02:05.738
That makes me recognize
the value of forging

02:05.774 --> 02:09.609
stable business partnerships
with my new neighbors.

02:09.645 --> 02:12.879
Which is why I'm offering you a job.

02:12.915 --> 02:13.947
A job?

02:13.983 --> 02:16.516
Well, a role, if you will.

02:16.552 --> 02:18.151
I am the head of the Kensington Firm.

02:18.187 --> 02:22.789
Ms. Bishop, there is no
Kensington Firm in Los Angeles.

02:22.825 --> 02:27.393
I've already absorbed
what little you had,

02:27.429 --> 02:30.763
and every single crime family in town

02:30.799 --> 02:35.468
has asked that I not let
you leave here alive tonight.

02:35.504 --> 02:38.371
Which means that they're afraid of you,

02:38.407 --> 02:40.473
and I could use someone
like that on my payroll.

02:40.509 --> 02:42.942
So...

02:42.978 --> 02:46.613
you give me back my drugs

02:46.649 --> 02:48.148
and we'll call it a deal.

02:48.184 --> 02:52.452
O-Or you keep the drugs and...

02:52.488 --> 02:54.588
we call it an act of war.

02:56.258 --> 02:59.159
Think about it. Take 24 hours.

02:59.195 --> 03:01.594
And I will call you and let you know

03:01.630 --> 03:03.096
where you can deliver them.

03:11.473 --> 03:13.073
What is it?

03:15.844 --> 03:17.610
My God.

03:17.646 --> 03:19.486
- How could you let this happen?
- How could I?

03:19.515 --> 03:21.814
I left my security people
with her at the hotel.

03:21.850 --> 03:23.583
- Where were yours?
- At the hotel.

03:23.619 --> 03:25.118
Sophie took a bullet
trying to save Tessa.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.853
She's in surgery now, so don't you even.

03:26.889 --> 03:28.321
- Where were you?
- Where were you?

03:28.357 --> 03:30.557
I'm not the one at war with
Felicity. That's you two.

03:30.593 --> 03:31.825
So now it's my fault, is it?

03:31.827 --> 03:33.226
- Of course it is.
- Yes. - It is!

03:33.262 --> 03:36.629
Fine, then I will go and
finish what I started.

03:36.665 --> 03:38.831
No, you won't. She has Tessa.

03:38.867 --> 03:41.501
Let's find out what Felicity
wants and give it to her.

03:41.537 --> 03:43.503
- She wants Rhys.
- She wants the Firm.

03:43.539 --> 03:45.772
Well, she'll have to settle for
you because there is no Firm.

03:45.774 --> 03:46.673
- What? - What?
- What do you mean?

03:46.675 --> 03:47.774
What are you talking about?

03:47.810 --> 03:50.710
- There's been a hostile takeover.
- By whom?

03:50.746 --> 03:53.528
By a man who insists on
calling himself "Mockingbird."

03:55.383 --> 03:56.748
As in Mockingbird Trust?

03:56.784 --> 04:00.318
And have you met with
this... "Mockingbird"?

04:00.354 --> 04:02.320
- Who is he?
- I have no idea.

04:02.356 --> 04:04.222
But he's a cocky
little son of a bitch...

04:04.258 --> 04:06.925
who's allied himself with
every major player in...

04:06.927 --> 04:09.427
That's her. It's Felicity.

04:12.933 --> 04:13.933
Yes.

04:13.968 --> 04:15.033
Hello, darling.

04:15.069 --> 04:16.166
If you've hurt her...

04:16.202 --> 04:18.435
I've no intention of hurting her,

04:18.471 --> 04:20.338
as long as you do as I say.

04:20.374 --> 04:22.440
Put her on speaker.

04:22.476 --> 04:24.876
- Are you listening?
- What do you want?

04:24.912 --> 04:26.478
Cash? Diamonds?

04:26.514 --> 04:28.646
I want you and Rhys
at the Beechwood Dam,

04:28.682 --> 04:30.014
tomorrow at noon.

04:30.050 --> 04:32.517
And bring Ben as well.

04:32.553 --> 04:35.487
It'll be a comfort for Tessa
to go home with her father.

04:37.992 --> 04:40.024
Well, we are not doing that.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.993
- Yes, we are.
- What?

04:42.029 --> 04:43.762
- Babe.
- Call her back and tell her...

04:43.798 --> 04:46.364
Stop. You two had your chance.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.525
This time, we're doing it my way.

04:54.023 --> 04:55.531
Any word on Sophie?

04:55.534 --> 04:56.932
She is out of surgery.

04:56.935 --> 04:58.277
The doctor said she did great.

04:58.279 --> 04:59.344
- Can I see her?
- No.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.245
No.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.480
Why not?

05:02.917 --> 05:04.616
She's asleep.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.418
And her parents are here.

05:06.454 --> 05:08.319
And they're not really happy with us.

05:08.355 --> 05:09.855
- Well, I should go talk to them.
- No, you shouldn't.

05:09.857 --> 05:13.491
They don't want to talk.
They want to sue us.

05:13.527 --> 05:15.994
Of course they do, and they should.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.629
- Allie...
- They will be fine.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.564
She will be fine, but...

05:19.600 --> 05:21.666
In the meantime, we have Sophie's laptop

05:21.702 --> 05:23.601
which has all the Weatherby Hotel's

05:23.637 --> 05:25.336
in-house camera footage and call logs

05:25.372 --> 05:27.272
from the night Rhys shot Felicity.

05:27.308 --> 05:28.919
It's all encrypted at the moment,

05:28.922 --> 05:31.122
but if Val can decrypt it,
we may be able to find out

05:31.125 --> 05:32.677
who saved Felicity's life that night.

05:32.713 --> 05:34.279
And who she's working with now.

05:34.315 --> 05:37.282
Which might even tell
us how to find her.

05:38.675 --> 05:40.619
I really don't like that there are only

05:40.621 --> 05:42.187
two access points to that dam.

05:42.223 --> 05:44.522
She'll probably try to box
us in when we get up there.

05:44.558 --> 05:47.392
- "Us"?
- Don't even start.

05:48.462 --> 05:49.728
You think she'll give her back?

05:51.599 --> 05:54.833
Felicity wants Rhys and
Margot. She doesn't want Tessa.

05:54.869 --> 05:57.135
What?

05:57.171 --> 05:59.137
Well, it's just, I don't
even know this girl.

05:59.173 --> 06:00.799
Yes, you do.

06:00.802 --> 06:03.141
A few weeks ago, I didn't
even know she existed.

06:03.143 --> 06:04.742
Now, I'm ready to die for her?

06:04.778 --> 06:06.645
You're not gonna die.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.211
I mean, what is that?

06:11.852 --> 06:13.251
We're gonna get her back.

06:15.356 --> 06:17.655
Felicity's gonna be
expecting us to try something.

06:17.691 --> 06:21.226
She will be expecting you, Rhys,
and Margot to try something.

06:21.262 --> 06:24.096
She won't necessarily be expecting me.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.149
It's high-risk.

06:32.152 --> 06:33.584
But we have a way to recover Tessa

06:33.587 --> 06:35.773
- without sacrificing either of you.
- How?

06:35.809 --> 06:38.910
Our plan starts here in
the south side of the dam.

06:38.946 --> 06:41.980
I'll drive the two of you to
the meet, as Felicity requested.

06:42.016 --> 06:43.548
But we won't be alone.

06:43.584 --> 06:45.704
While you're on the ground,
I'll be your eyes and ears

06:45.719 --> 06:48.019
parked in a surveillance
van a quarter mile east

06:48.055 --> 06:50.054
of the dam's walkway,
completely out of sight.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.756
I have a visual on you.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.525
Anyone on approach?

06:53.561 --> 06:54.926
Not yet.

06:54.962 --> 06:56.628
But they'll be here.

06:56.664 --> 06:57.862
And we'll be ready for them.

06:57.898 --> 06:59.497
Because we'll be armed to the teeth.

06:59.533 --> 07:00.999
No, no guns.

07:01.762 --> 07:03.268
- Benji.
- That's absurd.

07:03.304 --> 07:04.731
No guns on us.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.805
That doesn't mean we
won't have guns on them.

07:06.807 --> 07:08.373
We will have a sniper in position

07:08.409 --> 07:10.542
on this ridge overlooking the dam.

07:10.578 --> 07:12.044
Who's your sniper?

07:13.247 --> 07:14.846
They're here.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.881
Two S.U.V.s on approach from the north.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.650
Copy that. Ben?

07:18.686 --> 07:20.985
I see them. Here we go.

07:22.556 --> 07:23.556
Allie, I'm in.

07:27.261 --> 07:32.497
I count two hostiles and two drivers.

07:36.737 --> 07:37.902
What's our play?

07:37.938 --> 07:39.103
Ben makes the exchange.

07:39.139 --> 07:40.606
When he and Tessa are
at a safe distance,

07:40.608 --> 07:42.574
blow the hostiles' tires. Copy?

07:42.610 --> 07:43.508
Copy.

07:43.544 --> 07:45.643
Rhys said he shot Felicity

07:45.679 --> 07:48.346
and left his room around 9:30 p.m.

07:48.382 --> 07:50.281
- Mom.
- It's all right, darling.

07:50.317 --> 07:52.050
- We're here.
- Are you okay?

07:52.086 --> 07:54.185
Open your jackets, empty your pockets.

07:54.221 --> 07:55.653
We're not carrying.

07:55.689 --> 07:56.921
Convince me.

07:56.957 --> 07:58.890
Phone records show an outgoing call

07:58.926 --> 08:03.595
placed from that room at
9:36 p.m. to another suite.

08:03.631 --> 08:05.229
Who was in the other suite?

08:05.265 --> 08:06.765
Felix McCall.

08:07.801 --> 08:08.801
Do we know who that is?

08:08.836 --> 08:10.134
He's one of my lieutenants.

08:10.170 --> 08:12.170
But why would she have called Felix?

08:12.206 --> 08:13.406
They both work for Kensington.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.240
But the last we saw him,
he was working for...

08:15.242 --> 08:16.507
Given your management style,

08:16.543 --> 08:18.343
can you blame Felix
for wanting a new boss?

08:18.379 --> 08:20.578
And that's you, is it?

08:20.614 --> 08:22.780
No. No, no. That's not possible.

08:22.816 --> 08:25.250
Ben? Babe, it's a setup.

08:26.353 --> 08:28.353
Tessa's been working with
Felicity the whole time.

08:30.958 --> 08:32.690
You little bitch.

08:32.726 --> 08:34.359
What the hell is this?

08:34.395 --> 08:36.961
This is what Felicity and
I had planned all along.

08:36.996 --> 08:39.230
Tessa, put it away. Let's talk.

08:39.265 --> 08:41.131
We'll have plenty of time for that,

08:41.168 --> 08:42.533
'cause you're coming with us.

08:45.639 --> 08:47.506
Take those two.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:56.950 --> 08:58.650
Is Alice Vaughan listening?

08:58.686 --> 09:01.052
I have a message for you, Alice.

09:01.088 --> 09:03.421
If you or any of your people attempt

09:03.457 --> 09:05.256
to thwart our departure,

09:05.292 --> 09:07.492
I will kill him.

09:07.528 --> 09:09.794
Do you understand?

09:09.830 --> 09:11.129
Move.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.966
What do you want me to do, Allie?

09:15.002 --> 09:16.702
Do I take her out?

09:21.408 --> 09:22.574
Allie?

09:25.579 --> 09:26.912
Stand down.

09:31.072 --> 09:33.406
It's over.

09:37.319 --> 09:38.350
Alice.

09:38.353 --> 09:40.880
I'm sorry to barge in,
but we have a problem.

09:40.916 --> 09:42.781
- What's wrong?
- Ethan, what are you...

09:42.817 --> 09:45.050
We were waiting for Ben.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.252
You okay?

09:47.277 --> 09:49.922
What's the problem?

09:49.958 --> 09:51.324
The problem is, he's not coming.

09:52.127 --> 09:53.993
Ben has a 15-year-old daughter.

09:54.029 --> 09:55.794
Who just kidnapped him and Rhys.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.830
- And his baby mama is...
- Margot Bishop.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.865
The head of the Kensington Firm.

09:59.901 --> 10:02.134
- Kensington Firm?
- British crime family.

10:02.170 --> 10:03.802
Please tell me that my Cls

10:03.838 --> 10:06.906
haven't been working for
Margot Bishop this whole time.

10:06.942 --> 10:09.808
No, they haven't. Ben
just found out about Tessa.

10:09.811 --> 10:13.188
Do you not remember how it
feels to be lied to by this man?

10:13.224 --> 10:14.489
He didn't lie to you.

10:14.525 --> 10:16.491
He has come through for
you on every single case,

10:16.527 --> 10:18.660
and he helped find your husband.

10:18.696 --> 10:20.128
He told you about that?

10:20.164 --> 10:21.797
You want to yell at him?

10:21.833 --> 10:24.238
Help me save his life,
then you can yell at him.

10:24.241 --> 10:25.901
Where do you think she's taken them?

10:25.903 --> 10:27.669
We pinged their phones... Nothing.

10:27.705 --> 10:29.653
So, you have no leads
at all at this time.

10:29.656 --> 10:31.506
- No, I didn't say that.
- What do you got?

10:31.542 --> 10:33.875
We have "Mockingbird."

10:33.911 --> 10:35.677
As in the Mockingbird Trust.

10:35.713 --> 10:37.513
You know about that, too?

10:38.516 --> 10:40.382
He is in so much trouble.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.665
Who is he? "Mockingbird"?

10:43.668 --> 10:46.612
All I know is that he
said I work for him now,

10:46.648 --> 10:49.238
which I suppose means
you work for him now.

10:49.241 --> 10:50.563
Did you know about this?

10:50.566 --> 10:51.850
Of course not.

10:51.886 --> 10:53.252
I would've told you.

10:53.288 --> 10:57.723
Such loyalty. So rare in one so young.

10:57.759 --> 11:01.093
So, who is she... the girl
you hired to play Tessa?

11:01.129 --> 11:04.730
That's the best part.
She really is your daughter.

11:04.766 --> 11:06.966
Felicity's the one who
found me in Sheffield.

11:07.002 --> 11:10.336
She told who I was, who you all were.

11:10.372 --> 11:12.371
I had no idea.

11:12.407 --> 11:14.006
So, why use her?

11:14.042 --> 11:16.809
Why not just come back and kill me?

11:16.845 --> 11:19.745
Because she wanted Kensington.

11:19.781 --> 11:21.914
So, I thought about staging a coup,

11:21.950 --> 11:24.750
but it is a family business, after all.

11:24.786 --> 11:26.352
I'm not family.

11:26.388 --> 11:28.921
And who told you about Tessa?

11:28.957 --> 11:31.156
Your mother, of course.

11:31.192 --> 11:32.992
She was drunk.

11:33.028 --> 11:35.661
And imagine my delight at
hearing the family secret...

11:35.697 --> 11:40.499
A child, a rightful
heir, cruelly thrown away.

11:40.535 --> 11:43.435
So, you kill us, and
Tessa's your puppet.

11:43.471 --> 11:46.071
Do I strike you as anyone's puppet?

11:46.107 --> 11:48.741
You strike me as young and entitled

11:48.777 --> 11:50.509
and not long for this world.

11:50.545 --> 11:53.445
The minute you decide
to think for yourself,

11:53.481 --> 11:55.247
she'll kill you.

11:55.283 --> 11:57.671
Not if she kills Felicity first.

11:57.674 --> 11:59.285
That's if Felicity can be killed.

11:59.321 --> 12:01.787
Try a wooden stake through the heart.

12:01.823 --> 12:04.523
Once you both die,
having killed each other

12:04.559 --> 12:07.793
in what will look like a
gruesome brother/sister spat,

12:07.829 --> 12:11.163
she'll be queen and I'll be her counsel.

12:11.199 --> 12:12.798
The queen of what?

12:12.834 --> 12:16.201
Because now that
Mockingbird owns the Firm,

12:16.237 --> 12:17.736
she has nothing.

12:17.772 --> 12:19.638
You have nothing.

12:19.674 --> 12:22.241
Call him... Mockingbird.

12:22.277 --> 12:24.743
Set up another meet.

12:24.779 --> 12:27.746
I'm sure he and I can
come to an understanding.

12:27.782 --> 12:30.983
I would, but I have no
way of contacting him.

12:31.019 --> 12:34.053
He's supposed to call me to
see if I've agreed to his terms.

12:34.089 --> 12:36.955
Then you're of no use to me.

12:36.991 --> 12:38.581
Frankie.

12:38.584 --> 12:39.825
Easy, Frankie.

12:39.861 --> 12:41.660
Because if Margot
doesn't answer his call,

12:41.696 --> 12:43.302
there will be no
meeting with Mockingbird.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.670
You need her.

12:47.068 --> 12:49.702
Fine. We'll wait for his call.

13:01.516 --> 13:04.016
That's her, one of
my former sales associates...

13:04.052 --> 13:05.223
- Carol Cooney.
- She's the one who

13:05.225 --> 13:06.619
was laundering
Mockingbird's money?

13:06.621 --> 13:07.920
- Yeah.
- You think she'll help us?

13:07.922 --> 13:10.356
Well, I told Agent Diaz
if Carol helps us find Ben,

13:10.392 --> 13:11.690
I'll drop the charges.

13:11.726 --> 13:13.425
No, you don't have to do that.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.595
And she probably won't let you anyway.

13:17.499 --> 13:22.034
Listen, um...

13:22.070 --> 13:23.235
about what I said last night.

13:23.271 --> 13:24.681
- No, Ethan.
- No, I had no right.

13:24.684 --> 13:26.350
Stop. Please stop.

13:29.244 --> 13:30.977
I'm glad you said it.

13:38.953 --> 13:40.819
Look, I'm with Ben now.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.521
I know. I know that.

13:42.557 --> 13:43.823
But...

13:46.428 --> 13:48.761
But I was gonna spend the
rest of my life with you.

13:57.839 --> 13:59.872
I'm always gonna love you.

14:05.079 --> 14:07.846
I'm not sure if that
makes it better or worse.

14:11.252 --> 14:13.352
It's just the way it is.

14:15.557 --> 14:16.923
Yeah.

14:22.831 --> 14:25.564
I will check in with Agent Diaz

14:25.600 --> 14:28.401
and see where we are with Carol.

14:32.106 --> 14:33.739
Let's find Ben.

14:35.143 --> 14:36.608
All right?

14:36.644 --> 14:38.911
So, I'm not going to jail?

14:38.947 --> 14:42.314
- No, you are.
- But if you help us find Mockingbird...

14:42.350 --> 14:43.982
I might see about getting the judge

14:44.018 --> 14:45.517
to offer you a shorter sentence.

14:45.553 --> 14:46.852
And then when I get out,

14:46.888 --> 14:48.754
I could have my old job back?

14:48.790 --> 14:50.622
- Um...
- No.

14:50.658 --> 14:52.791
That's... no.

14:52.827 --> 14:55.894
Carol, you need to focus
on finding Mockingbird.

14:55.930 --> 14:58.464
Right. Well, like I told these guys,

14:58.500 --> 15:00.966
I have no idea who Mockingbird is.

15:01.002 --> 15:03.735
He'd just sneak into
my office on Fridays

15:03.771 --> 15:07.072
and leave an envelope full
of cash on my desk every week.

15:07.108 --> 15:08.474
What about the money that he gave you

15:08.476 --> 15:10.008
to invest in Ethan's company?

15:10.044 --> 15:11.543
Well, those were all EFTs.

15:11.579 --> 15:13.545
But every electronic fund transfer

15:13.581 --> 15:15.447
generates some kind of receipt, right?

15:15.483 --> 15:17.316
Yeah, they'd go directly into the trust.

15:17.352 --> 15:20.686
So, what if, this time,

15:20.722 --> 15:22.454
instead of sending a receipt,

15:22.490 --> 15:25.023
you send an SOS saying...

15:25.059 --> 15:27.192
Your identity has been compromised.

15:27.228 --> 15:28.927
Well, it kinda has.

15:28.963 --> 15:32.798
You'd request an emergency
meeting for you and your team.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.366
But I don't have my team anymore.

15:34.402 --> 15:36.602
- Do I have...
- No, Carol.

15:36.638 --> 15:38.971
No, we're going to be your team.

15:39.007 --> 15:41.807
Do you have any sales experience?

15:41.843 --> 15:45.278
No. We'll be undercover.

15:46.565 --> 15:47.763
What, am I...

15:47.815 --> 15:49.915
am I gonna be undercover?

15:49.951 --> 15:54.186
Well, you'll be you, but... sort of.

15:54.222 --> 15:56.154
Can I just ask something?

15:56.190 --> 15:59.558
What would I wear for
something like that?

15:59.594 --> 16:03.396
Is there, like, a
wardrobe budget for that?

16:22.784 --> 16:24.616
This place is gorgeous!

16:24.652 --> 16:26.518
- Carol, focus.
- Sorry.

16:26.554 --> 16:28.086
- Carol!
- Dear God.

16:28.122 --> 16:30.188
It is a pleasure to finally...

16:30.224 --> 16:31.724
Are you kidding me?

16:32.627 --> 16:35.360
- Val?
- Tommy, you're Mockingbird?

16:35.396 --> 16:37.229
You know this guy? Who is he?

16:37.265 --> 16:39.031
He's not Mockingbird.

16:39.067 --> 16:42.229
He's my idiot baby brother.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.132
There is no way that
you are Mockingbird.

16:49.135 --> 16:51.896
That's the problem... You
have never believed in me.

16:51.932 --> 16:54.098
- Tommy.
- I am Mockingbird.

16:54.134 --> 16:56.534
Then I'm afraid you're going
away for a very long time.

16:56.570 --> 16:58.670
I am not Mockingbird.

16:58.706 --> 16:59.971
Then who is?

17:00.007 --> 17:02.206
- A friend...
- Do I know this friend?

17:02.242 --> 17:05.209
Who would kill me if
I told you his name.

17:05.244 --> 17:07.388
His name? It's a him.

17:07.392 --> 17:09.247
Doesn't sound like a friend to me.

17:09.249 --> 17:10.748
Maybe I can protect you from him.

17:10.784 --> 17:12.016
You can't.

17:12.051 --> 17:13.984
Then you're gonna have to pretend

17:14.021 --> 17:16.088
to be Mockingbird for
a little bit longer.

17:17.183 --> 17:18.815
We need you to call Margot.

17:18.818 --> 17:20.590
Well, I can't call her now.

17:20.627 --> 17:22.660
I told Margot 24 hours.

17:22.695 --> 17:26.030
If I call now, it's gonna
make me seem anxious.

17:26.066 --> 17:27.799
If you don't call her, I'll arrest you.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.601
But then again, you know, I am the boss.

17:30.237 --> 17:31.703
Right? Yo...

17:33.674 --> 17:37.275
It's... It's probably good to
keep her on her toes, right?

17:43.650 --> 17:45.316
It's him.

17:45.352 --> 17:46.485
Answer it.

17:50.924 --> 17:53.391
- Hello?
- Ms. Bishop.

17:53.427 --> 17:56.828
Are you ready to return those
drugs that you stole from me?

17:56.864 --> 17:58.797
- What?!
- What?

18:00.667 --> 18:01.799
Just one second.

18:01.835 --> 18:04.669
An associate of mine
is assuming leadership

18:04.705 --> 18:07.372
of the Kensington Firm,
effective immediately.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.796
If you want your shipment back,

18:08.807 --> 18:10.331
you'll need to discuss it with her.

18:12.346 --> 18:16.614
Is this the famous Mockingbird?

18:16.650 --> 18:18.549
When can we meet?

18:18.585 --> 18:20.419
Well, that's it, then.

18:23.424 --> 18:25.089
Look.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.992
For what it's worth, we had this plan

18:28.028 --> 18:30.195
laid out before I ever met you.

18:31.465 --> 18:34.499
It wasn't... It wasn't personal.

18:36.637 --> 18:40.438
The only thing I knew about
you was that you abandoned me.

18:40.474 --> 18:43.375
Well, you know more now, don't you?

18:45.078 --> 18:49.414
So, whose child are you... Ours or hers?

18:55.689 --> 18:58.122
Here is the address.

18:58.158 --> 19:00.858
She is expecting me.

19:00.894 --> 19:02.460
400 South Corvis.

19:02.496 --> 19:04.329
I'll secure a three-block
radius around the building.

19:04.331 --> 19:06.164
What are you thinking...
Six-man tac team?

19:06.200 --> 19:07.532
Where do you think you're going?

19:07.568 --> 19:09.167
Am I not free to go?

19:09.203 --> 19:10.134
- No.
- Hell, no!

19:10.170 --> 19:11.369
You're not leaving.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.838
Danny, can you join us?

19:13.874 --> 19:15.973
Sure. What's going on?

19:16.009 --> 19:17.375
What's up, buddy?

19:18.178 --> 19:19.744
What the hell is he doing here?

19:19.780 --> 19:21.446
Nothing, and you're
gonna stay here with him

19:21.448 --> 19:22.413
to make sure of that.

19:22.449 --> 19:23.915
Wh... Where are you guys going?

19:23.951 --> 19:25.516
To take down Felicity.

19:25.552 --> 19:27.018
Not without me, you're not!

19:27.054 --> 19:29.020
- My girlfriend is...
- Danny.

19:29.056 --> 19:31.556
Do you remember Agent Diaz from the FBI?

19:31.592 --> 19:32.990
Hello.

19:33.026 --> 19:34.826
Watch him.

19:36.997 --> 19:38.396
So, who's your girlfriend?

19:38.432 --> 19:40.265
Are you not seeing Sophie anymore?

19:41.602 --> 19:43.901
Well, that's settled.

19:43.937 --> 19:49.106
Now, Rhys, I'll need you over there.

19:49.142 --> 19:50.508
Easy, Frankie.

19:50.544 --> 19:54.078
If it's all the same to you,
I'll walk while I still can.

19:54.114 --> 19:58.750
Margot darling, you'll need
to be directly across from him.

20:00.954 --> 20:03.154
And I'll need the guns.

20:03.190 --> 20:05.490
If we get this just right,

20:05.526 --> 20:07.191
it'll look as if you shot each other.

20:07.227 --> 20:11.462
Benjamin Jones will have lost
his life in the crossfire.

20:11.498 --> 20:13.731
And when our friend the
Mockingbird shows up,

20:13.767 --> 20:15.466
he'll be joining you.

20:15.502 --> 20:17.602
The only question is

20:17.638 --> 20:20.371
who to shoot first.

20:20.407 --> 20:23.040
Ooh, may I suggest yourself?

20:23.076 --> 20:25.209
You've helped me decide.

20:25.245 --> 20:27.279
Goodbye, Rhys.

20:34.688 --> 20:36.187
I can't let you hurt them.

20:38.091 --> 20:39.957
- Tessa.
- Stop talking.

20:39.993 --> 20:42.561
Drop your weapons, or I kill her.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.400
Do as she says.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.358
There are zip ties in that drawer.

20:54.174 --> 20:56.107
Darling, I know this is difficult.

20:56.143 --> 20:58.843
But they are terrible, selfish people.

20:58.879 --> 21:02.013
Yes. So am I.

21:02.049 --> 21:04.287
I tried to kill Mum, and she took me in.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.618
Dad could've turned me over
to the FBI, but he didn't.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.853
And I'm sorry Uncle Rhys shot you,

21:08.889 --> 21:11.589
but I'm not about to
lose my family over it.

21:11.625 --> 21:14.625
You're just like them...
A conniving little bitch.

21:14.661 --> 21:17.595
Well, I learned from the best.

21:17.631 --> 21:19.163
Am I meant to be insulted by that?

21:19.199 --> 21:20.932
She didn't mean you.

21:23.236 --> 21:24.535
She meant me.

21:24.571 --> 21:27.538
I found a Taser in the zip tie drawer.

21:28.909 --> 21:33.344
I am... sorry about all this.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.613
I didn't know when this started

21:35.649 --> 21:39.317
that you'd turn out to be you.

21:39.353 --> 21:41.352
Alice texted that the FBI's on its way.

21:41.388 --> 21:42.388
You need to leave now.

21:42.422 --> 21:43.654
I could not agree more.

21:43.690 --> 21:45.856
Not us. Justine thinks she's saving us.

21:45.892 --> 21:47.993
Unless you want to be
on the FBI's radar...

21:48.631 --> 21:50.995
We can go out the back.

21:51.031 --> 21:52.864
I'll show you.

21:53.934 --> 21:55.734
Margot, go.

21:57.537 --> 21:59.137
Let's go, then.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.572
What are you doing?

22:01.608 --> 22:03.040
I'm gonna finish what I started.

22:03.076 --> 22:04.476
No, you're not. She's not a threat.

22:04.478 --> 22:05.743
She will be when she wakes up,

22:05.779 --> 22:07.478
and this way she gets
to die in her sleep.

22:07.514 --> 22:10.514
Justine will have you
arrested. There are witnesses.

22:10.550 --> 22:11.816
Right.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.317
I'll have to shoot them, too.

22:13.353 --> 22:15.019
Rhys, stop. You can't do this.

22:15.055 --> 22:17.212
- You cannot kill them.
- I'll save you the trouble.

22:21.161 --> 22:22.193
Your daughter's next.

22:24.197 --> 22:25.749
Rhys!

22:25.752 --> 22:27.098
I'm fine. It's a flesh wound.

22:27.134 --> 22:28.532
Go, finish it.

22:33.607 --> 22:34.572
Hey!

22:34.608 --> 22:36.207
What took you so long?

22:36.243 --> 22:38.609
You know, it's L.A... Traffic.

22:39.780 --> 22:40.911
You okay?

22:40.947 --> 22:42.047
Tessa saved us.

22:43.316 --> 22:45.016
Rhys did get hit in
the shoulder, though.

22:45.052 --> 22:46.250
I'll call an ambulance.

22:46.286 --> 22:47.785
And Margot and Tessa?

22:47.821 --> 22:49.054
They took off.

22:52.592 --> 22:53.791
How'd you find us?

22:53.827 --> 22:55.860
Tommy Vaughan.

22:56.663 --> 22:59.397
So, can we go visit Sophie?
Are they letting her see people?

22:59.433 --> 23:01.432
No, you can't go visit her.

23:01.468 --> 23:02.467
What do you mean, I can't?

23:02.469 --> 23:03.635
No.

23:04.571 --> 23:06.037
Why are you here?

23:06.073 --> 23:08.139
You had $3 million.

23:08.175 --> 23:09.640
You were gonna start your life over.

23:09.676 --> 23:12.843
I may have made some
questionable business decisions.

23:12.879 --> 23:13.956
- Such as?
- Did you know that

23:13.958 --> 23:15.448
racehorses can have heart attacks?

23:15.482 --> 23:16.646
Because I had no idea,

23:16.649 --> 23:18.583
and it's not like anyone
bothered to tell me.

23:18.585 --> 23:21.086
Can I just ask you a question?

23:25.425 --> 23:26.958
Why do you do it?

23:27.994 --> 23:32.663
Why do you... keep coming back here,

23:32.699 --> 23:34.833
when you only end up hurting her?

23:36.636 --> 23:39.770
Because she's my sister.

23:39.806 --> 23:41.605
And she's all I have.

23:45.779 --> 23:49.080
Looks like Agent Diaz called me a car.

23:50.751 --> 23:51.751
Hello.

23:55.088 --> 23:57.455
Tell Sophie that I say hi, okay?

24:04.831 --> 24:07.898
How'd it go?

24:07.934 --> 24:09.834
Margot and Tessa got away somehow.

24:09.870 --> 24:11.368
But we got Felicity.

24:11.404 --> 24:12.870
Alice got Felicity.

24:12.906 --> 24:14.772
Then we got Rhys to the hospital.

24:14.808 --> 24:16.507
Dead, by any chance?

24:16.543 --> 24:18.663
Winged in the shoulder.
Ben's with him. He'll be fine.

24:18.678 --> 24:20.845
- Where's Tommy?
- He's gone.

24:20.881 --> 24:22.847
Your guys came and got
him about an hour ago.

24:22.883 --> 24:25.149
What guys? I didn't send anyone.

24:25.185 --> 24:27.151
- No.
- Danny!

24:27.187 --> 24:28.219
They had badges.

24:28.255 --> 24:29.553
He got away?

24:29.589 --> 24:32.156
I'm so sorry, Agent
Diaz. We will find him.

24:32.192 --> 24:35.459
I will find him, and Margot Bishop.

24:35.495 --> 24:38.496
You'll be staying out
of my way from here on.

24:43.695 --> 24:44.945
He left his jacket.

24:44.948 --> 24:47.051
This is a very nice jacket.

24:47.054 --> 24:49.578
Are we sure your brother
isn't Mockingbird?

24:49.614 --> 24:52.348
I'm beginning to think he's a savant.

24:53.685 --> 24:55.551
Speaking of super villains...

24:55.587 --> 24:58.354
Find out where she is.

24:58.390 --> 25:01.023
- You okay?
- We are all right.

25:01.059 --> 25:03.459
- We?
- I'm with Tessa.

25:03.495 --> 25:05.594
- Okay, where?
- Somewhere safe.

25:05.630 --> 25:06.929
Yeah, where is that exactly?

25:06.965 --> 25:09.131
Because Agent Diaz and the FBI...

25:09.167 --> 25:10.767
We're at Alice's house.

25:14.506 --> 25:15.604
You're what?

25:15.640 --> 25:16.605
It's fine.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.274
A bit beige, but...

25:18.310 --> 25:20.542
Okay, does Alice know you're there?

25:20.578 --> 25:21.677
No, of course not.

25:21.713 --> 25:22.778
Then you can't be there.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.046
Well, that's why I'm calling.

25:24.082 --> 25:25.214
I need a favor.

25:26.384 --> 25:27.650
My God. What do you need?

25:27.686 --> 25:29.718
I need a jet.

25:29.754 --> 25:31.287
A jet?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.088
Preferably a six-seated Gulfstream,

25:33.124 --> 25:34.790
- but a Learjet will do.
- Margot...

25:34.826 --> 25:36.158
The sooner you find me one,

25:36.194 --> 25:38.194
the sooner we are out of Alice's house.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.264
What'd she say?

25:42.400 --> 25:44.733
She said she's fine. They're fine.

25:44.769 --> 25:46.002
Where is she?

25:47.505 --> 25:48.971
She didn't say.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.573
What did he say?

25:56.373 --> 25:58.674
Look, I told you I was sorry.

25:59.951 --> 26:01.584
And I saved your life.

26:03.922 --> 26:05.688
Maybe you shouldn't have.

26:05.724 --> 26:07.656
What's that supposed to mean?

26:07.692 --> 26:10.326
It means, what was the point?

26:10.362 --> 26:14.964
I spent my whole life killing myself...

26:15.003 --> 26:17.633
And other people...

26:17.669 --> 26:22.171
Trying to create something.

26:22.207 --> 26:26.942
First with my family,
then with your father,

26:26.978 --> 26:28.644
now with you.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.083
And I failed.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.221
The Firm's gone.

26:39.791 --> 26:43.125
Your father is with Alice.

26:43.161 --> 26:45.528
And you are...

26:50.301 --> 26:53.302
I am Margot Bishop's daughter.

26:53.338 --> 26:57.340
And I didn't save your life
so you could just give up.

26:59.010 --> 27:01.910
So if you're planning to
take that jet to some remote

27:01.946 --> 27:04.980
retirement village for
criminal might-have-beens,

27:05.016 --> 27:06.149
you can forget it.

27:10.221 --> 27:13.522
You promised to teach me
how to run a crime syndicate.

27:13.558 --> 27:16.125
There's no syndicate left to run.

27:16.161 --> 27:21.531
Then I suppose we'll just have
to build a new one, won't we?

27:26.786 --> 27:28.285
How's Rhys?

27:28.306 --> 27:29.972
Bullet grazed his shoulder.

27:30.008 --> 27:32.574
He's actually more upset
that she ruined his jacket.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.309
Any word from Margot? No.

27:34.345 --> 27:37.579
Because Agent Diaz is
going after her, and Tessa.

27:40.285 --> 27:43.118
She'll probably either end up
in juvie or be tried as an adult

27:43.154 --> 27:44.887
and spend the rest of her life in jail.

27:44.923 --> 27:46.355
Justine will never trust me again.

27:46.391 --> 27:47.589
That bridge is burned.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.491
She will if we give her Mockingbird.

27:49.527 --> 27:51.560
Well, you have any leads?

27:51.596 --> 27:54.763
Our best lead was
Tommy, who has escaped.

27:54.799 --> 27:57.227
The only thing he left behind was this.

27:59.938 --> 28:03.605
This is bespoke,
custom-made by a tailor.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.474
Mr. Vaughan loved the suit so much,

28:05.510 --> 28:07.342
he'd like to order another.

28:07.378 --> 28:09.822
He said he left his credit-card
number on file with you.

28:09.825 --> 28:11.447
May I confirm the number?

28:14.953 --> 28:17.753
I looked into Mockingbird Inc.'s
last few credit-card bills,

28:17.789 --> 28:19.788
but there's nothing out of the ordinary,

28:19.824 --> 28:21.557
though he does eat a ton of sushi.

28:21.593 --> 28:22.991
My brother hates sushi.

28:23.027 --> 28:24.460
He spends a lot of time at Vinzu.

28:24.496 --> 28:26.428
Vinzu? I thought it closed down.

28:26.464 --> 28:30.232
He was there May 18th, May 21st.

28:30.268 --> 28:31.633
Can you read me the others?

28:31.669 --> 28:34.269
Vinzu is where Justine, Rhys, and I

28:34.305 --> 28:36.271
broke up a diamond-smuggling ring.

28:36.307 --> 28:38.407
The cigar lounge is in Santa Barbara,

28:38.443 --> 28:39.509
and that's where we took down

28:39.511 --> 28:41.270
the gun-running outfit called "Argosy."

28:41.273 --> 28:43.612
This coffee joint is on the ground floor

28:43.648 --> 28:45.848
of the Blackwell Protection building

28:45.884 --> 28:47.850
where Justine arrested the C.E.O.

28:47.886 --> 28:49.418
So Tommy was following you.

28:49.454 --> 28:50.853
We take out the criminals...

28:50.889 --> 28:52.988
Then Tommy and Mockingbird would step in

28:53.024 --> 28:54.523
and fill the power vacuum.

28:54.559 --> 28:55.924
There is only one other person

28:55.960 --> 28:58.660
who had access to this information.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.363
Thanks for springing me.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.667
You like what you see, Thomas?

29:05.703 --> 29:09.772
Because it's ours now, every bit of it.

29:13.201 --> 29:14.740
What happened to your arm?

29:14.743 --> 29:16.951
A gift from an ex-girlfriend.

29:16.984 --> 29:19.584
Felicity, right? Alice told me.

29:20.928 --> 29:22.377
What else does Alice know?

29:22.413 --> 29:24.580
She knows I'm not Mockingbird.

29:24.616 --> 29:27.049
And how does she know that?

29:27.085 --> 29:31.420
She thinks that I'm not
capable of crime-bossery.

29:31.456 --> 29:34.990
Wow. You'll show her.

29:35.026 --> 29:37.559
You have a smuggling
ring, an arms dealership,

29:37.595 --> 29:39.862
and a private army at your command.

29:39.898 --> 29:42.397
Well, I mean, it's
mostly at your command.

29:42.433 --> 29:45.234
Yeah, but I can't be
the face of the thing.

29:45.270 --> 29:47.636
Because you don't want to be
the one who goes down for it.

29:47.672 --> 29:49.771
No one is going down for it.

29:49.807 --> 29:53.075
Rhys, they know I'm not Mockingbird.

29:53.111 --> 29:55.411
Then prove them wrong.

29:57.215 --> 29:59.081
We made a deal.

29:59.117 --> 30:01.783
You lost your money. You needed a job.

30:01.819 --> 30:04.419
You promised me Alice
wouldn't be involved.

30:04.455 --> 30:07.289
That is not my doing.

30:07.325 --> 30:09.491
And let me tell you something.

30:09.527 --> 30:12.027
If you want to keep Alice safe,

30:12.063 --> 30:14.763
see this through to the end.

30:22.006 --> 30:24.072
I'm gonna lose my job.

30:24.108 --> 30:25.240
No, you won't.

30:25.276 --> 30:26.975
I'm gonna get thrown in jail.

30:27.011 --> 30:30.512
He betrayed me, too. Endangered my deal.

30:30.548 --> 30:32.815
We will get him.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.220
That's not gonna be enough for the feds.

30:38.256 --> 30:41.456
We need Margot, too. And Tessa.

30:41.492 --> 30:43.225
Otherwise, it's going to look like

30:43.261 --> 30:45.027
we've all been working for Kensington.

30:45.063 --> 30:48.530
I can't just turn my kid over
to the criminal court system.

30:48.566 --> 30:51.767
But you'll trust her to Margot Bishop?

30:51.803 --> 30:56.205
Look, if you want your kid
to have any kind of a chance,

30:56.241 --> 30:57.973
you will tell me where they are.

30:58.009 --> 30:59.809
I don't know where they are.

31:01.879 --> 31:03.379
I swear to you.

31:05.319 --> 31:06.682
Have you talked to Margot?

31:06.684 --> 31:08.016
No.

31:08.052 --> 31:09.151
No.

31:10.888 --> 31:12.655
What about you?

31:14.692 --> 31:16.825
Have you talked to Margot Bishop?

31:26.871 --> 31:28.770
What's going on?

31:28.806 --> 31:30.872
The FBI is looking for you.

31:30.908 --> 31:32.459
You're not safe.

31:32.462 --> 31:33.742
What should I do?

31:33.778 --> 31:36.078
Just stay put until I get there.

31:44.589 --> 31:46.154
I have three units on their way now.

31:46.190 --> 31:47.456
Ben, you're riding with me.

31:47.492 --> 31:49.558
- Danny and I will follow after.
- No, you're not.

31:49.594 --> 31:51.360
AVI is sitting this
one out, Ms. Vaughan.

31:51.396 --> 31:52.861
No, we will not! It's my house!

31:52.897 --> 31:54.930
- Allie...
- Jones, we're moving.

31:54.966 --> 31:56.198
I'm sorry.

31:56.234 --> 31:57.833
Do not let her ransack my house.

31:57.869 --> 31:59.101
I'll call you.

32:01.906 --> 32:03.171
Ben, Agent Diaz.

32:03.207 --> 32:05.641
- Mr. Ward.
- Ethan, what are you doing here?

32:05.677 --> 32:07.743
I'm not sure. Allie called.

32:07.779 --> 32:09.578
Ethan, you're here.

32:09.614 --> 32:10.746
You called him.

32:10.782 --> 32:12.714
Yes... work stuff.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.116
I thought you two weren't
working together anymore.

32:14.118 --> 32:15.751
Are you coming or not?

32:18.256 --> 32:19.354
Call me.

32:19.390 --> 32:20.722
I will.

32:20.758 --> 32:23.925
What's going on? You okay?

32:23.961 --> 32:26.261
I am, but I need your help.

32:33.871 --> 32:35.204
We need the key.

32:37.175 --> 32:40.309
These are choices they
made, crimes they committed.

32:48.186 --> 32:49.719
Key.

32:51.456 --> 32:52.988
On three.

32:53.024 --> 32:54.156
Ready?

32:55.860 --> 32:58.960
One...

32:58.996 --> 33:00.096
Two...

33:08.906 --> 33:10.605
Kitchen's clear.

33:10.641 --> 33:12.574
Clear. Clear!

33:12.610 --> 33:13.475
Clear.

33:13.511 --> 33:14.576
All rooms secure.

33:14.612 --> 33:16.779
There's no one here, ma'am.

33:21.285 --> 33:24.019
Where the hell is Benjamin Jones?

33:28.659 --> 33:30.893
Thank you for the warning.

33:31.896 --> 33:35.498
We need to leave. Now.

33:38.536 --> 33:40.469
Margot and Tessa are gone.

33:40.505 --> 33:44.406
And since you are, too,
I'm calling to inform you

33:44.442 --> 33:48.210
that you have violated
the terms of your deal.

33:48.246 --> 33:50.546
I can't help you now.

33:52.650 --> 33:54.617
You're going down.

33:59.086 --> 34:00.618
Ben broke his deal,

34:00.654 --> 34:03.321
which he never would have
done without your consent.

34:03.357 --> 34:06.290
So, if you tell me where he is,

34:06.326 --> 34:08.960
I will consider lessening
the charges against you...

34:08.996 --> 34:11.128
and your company.

34:11.164 --> 34:12.797
- Excuse me?
- Agent Diaz...

34:12.833 --> 34:14.498
Where is he?

34:14.534 --> 34:16.467
Because I'm arresting somebody tonight,

34:16.503 --> 34:18.370
and it may as well be you.

34:19.739 --> 34:22.206
What if I can give you Rhys?

34:22.242 --> 34:24.141
Then will you leave my sister alone?

34:24.177 --> 34:25.676
Tommy.

34:25.712 --> 34:29.447
Can you get me Rhys?

34:29.483 --> 34:30.982
Yeah, probably not.

34:31.018 --> 34:33.985
But I can get you his
entire operation...

34:34.021 --> 34:37.688
All the guns, all the
money, all the players.

34:37.724 --> 34:38.857
You could have it all.

34:41.661 --> 34:43.228
I'm done.

34:45.197 --> 34:47.331
I can't believe you came back.

34:47.367 --> 34:49.522
What? I always come back.

34:49.525 --> 34:52.303
Usually because you need money.

34:52.339 --> 34:54.438
But this time, you came back for me.

34:54.474 --> 34:57.942
Well, if I'm being
honest, I came back to see

34:57.978 --> 35:00.378
if you can get me out
of this thing with Rhys.

35:00.414 --> 35:03.648
I've got an APB out on
Rhys, and Margot and Tessa.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.950
And Ben.

35:08.722 --> 35:11.256
You know that he is only
doing this for Tessa.

35:12.526 --> 35:14.425
Ben spending the rest
of his life in jail

35:14.461 --> 35:16.361
isn't gonna help Tessa.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.001
I'm sorry, Ms. Vaughan.

35:29.943 --> 35:31.576
Let's go.

35:35.048 --> 35:36.280
I love you.

35:36.316 --> 35:38.583
I love you.

35:42.022 --> 35:43.688
Ben's gonna be okay.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.826
You always make everything okay.

36:15.522 --> 36:17.822
Wow. You actually did it.

36:17.858 --> 36:20.124
Don't sound so surprised.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.961
When have I ever said no to you?

36:23.997 --> 36:26.297
Never.

36:28.502 --> 36:31.869
You've never not come through for me.

36:31.905 --> 36:33.771
So, don't disappoint me now.

36:33.807 --> 36:35.973
Why, what happens now?

36:36.009 --> 36:38.276
I'm about to ask you to come with us.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.345
Where are you?

36:41.381 --> 36:43.514
Benji! Where are you?

36:43.550 --> 36:45.602
I'm putting Margot and my daughter

36:45.605 --> 36:48.306
on a plane out of the
country, where they'll be safe.

36:49.589 --> 36:51.088
And then I'm coming for you.

36:51.124 --> 36:54.825
Benji, let me explain.

36:54.861 --> 36:55.960
You lied to me.

36:55.996 --> 36:58.342
- You used me.
- I did it for us.

36:58.345 --> 37:01.298
Compromised my deal and my
entire future with Alice.

37:01.334 --> 37:04.288
So we'd have something after our deal...

37:04.291 --> 37:06.591
Our own empire, bigger than Kensington.

37:06.627 --> 37:09.327
It's all yours, Rhys,
because we are done.

37:09.363 --> 37:10.429
You hear me?

37:12.733 --> 37:14.766
I'm coming for you.

37:20.908 --> 37:22.340
Very impressive. Thank you, Danny.

37:22.376 --> 37:25.843
I can't take all the
credit. I had a little help.

37:30.417 --> 37:31.683
This is Ethan's plane?

37:31.719 --> 37:33.785
Who else do we know that
owns his own airport?

37:33.821 --> 37:36.254
This is his airport, too? I
can't compete with this guy.

37:36.290 --> 37:39.190
You don't have to. She
loves you, you idiot.

37:47.735 --> 37:50.568
Ethan's plane?

37:50.604 --> 37:52.670
Well, it's just a six-seater,

37:52.706 --> 37:55.540
but he wanted to help.

37:55.576 --> 37:57.175
He's really gonna hate it if I kiss you

37:57.211 --> 37:59.277
in front of him, isn't he?

38:03.851 --> 38:05.783
Okay.

38:05.819 --> 38:08.319
I'll say goodbye to Tessa.

38:08.355 --> 38:09.587
No, you won't.

38:09.623 --> 38:12.423
You're going with them.

38:12.459 --> 38:14.892
No.

38:14.928 --> 38:16.127
I have to stay here with you.

38:16.163 --> 38:17.729
No, you can't.

38:17.731 --> 38:21.666
The FBI will not stop until they
put you and Rhys away for good.

38:24.972 --> 38:27.371
We will figure this out.

38:27.407 --> 38:29.273
Yes.

38:29.309 --> 38:30.309
If you get on that plane,

38:30.344 --> 38:32.477
I promise we will figure this out.

38:35.983 --> 38:37.448
Come with us.

38:41.021 --> 38:42.587
I can't run.

38:42.623 --> 38:44.255
I can't just disappear.

38:49.163 --> 38:50.561
Not yet.

38:50.597 --> 38:54.699
But soon?

38:54.735 --> 38:56.201
Promise me.

39:00.841 --> 39:02.340
Go.

39:15.522 --> 39:17.054
We have to leave now.

39:17.090 --> 39:18.356
You're coming with us?

39:18.392 --> 39:19.690
Thank God!

39:19.726 --> 39:21.859
I was so not looking
forward to single parenting.

39:21.895 --> 39:23.327
Now I'll have two daddies.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.896
You coming with?

39:31.672 --> 39:32.904
I don't think so.

39:32.940 --> 39:35.606
- But I thought you...
- I can't just leave her.

39:35.642 --> 39:37.074
Take care of each other.

39:40.414 --> 39:41.813
I don't believe in monogamy.

39:41.849 --> 39:43.314
You've made that pretty clear.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.886
Try not to...

39:48.922 --> 39:53.124
fall in love with
anyone till I get back.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.493
Then you better hurry back.

39:57.631 --> 39:58.864
We got to move!
