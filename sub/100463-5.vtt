WEBVTT

05:23.400 --> 05:24.810
Not moving too fast for you, am I?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.207
You want to take Flix Gallardo down?

05:45.010 --> 05:46.216
Testify.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.670
Take immunity.

05:49.220 --> 05:51.040
You could do it from a courtroom.

05:51.390 --> 05:53.005
You may not value my life, but I do.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.090
How's it work?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.555
The money from Flix?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.890
You on a regular payroll?

06:01.400 --> 06:04.358
Or you just take a pinch
out of the envelopes he has you deliver?

06:05.530 --> 06:07.020
What was your name again?

06:58.200 --> 07:01.579
No ticket home for us three
if he starts talking.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.882
Your brothers' agreement
with the Sinaloans has ended.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.261
It leaves us with an opportunity.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.938
By using your family's infrastructure,
routes,

08:06.020 --> 08:07.681
we piggyback our loads through customs.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.979
And once the product clears the border?
Arrives in the States?

08:12.070 --> 08:13.355
Then what?

08:13.450 --> 08:14.815
We use your drivers.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.284
And how long till that gets back
to my brothers? Just like that.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.866
What do you have in mind, boss?

08:25.420 --> 08:28.207
We do this? We do it right.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.718
And we do it our way.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.716
Work in Tijuana's hard to find.

08:41.680 --> 08:44.057
No one knows that better
than the gnngos.

08:46.770 --> 08:50.774
A recruit/77g agency based in San Diego
has an ofﬁce in 77juana,

08:50.860 --> 08:53.067
which sponsors women for work Visas.

08:55.110 --> 08:58.159
The gringos place them in jobs
across the border.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.538
They earn Amer/can wages
for cleaning hotel rooms.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.246
Houses.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.536
Ofﬁces.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.331
These women cross the border on foot
eve/y morn/ng,

09:09.420 --> 09:11.411
looking for a chance
to better their lives.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.587
And the company takes advantage of that.

09:14.670 --> 09:15.921
They pick them up,

09:17.010 --> 09:20.559
shuttle them back at the end
of a long shift,

09:21.260 --> 09:24.309
and in return,
take a piece of their earnings.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.013
Company’s end is 84%.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.227
Because with 20 American dollars
in their pocket;

09:32.820 --> 09:34.481
who ’5 going to complain?

09:35.650 --> 09:38.483
It’s more than these women
W/// ever make In MeX/co.

09:40.160 --> 09:43.118
So your plan's to bribe your way
into this company?

09:47.330 --> 09:49.241
I bought it last week.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.491
I run the books for my brothers.

09:52.590 --> 09:55.627
Seemed like a nice addition
to our "holdings."

09:57.220 --> 10:00.132
Starting tomorrow,
our girls are taking home full wages.

10:00.220 --> 10:03.462
On top of the $500 more
to move our coke.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.879
Mules.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.516
You say these women cross daily
on foot.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.897
How much could they possibly carry?

10:10.980 --> 10:12.641
Figure, half-a-pound a girl.

10:15.070 --> 10:18.813
But 35,000 people cross
the San Ysidro bridge every day.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.526
We have employed 700 of them.

10:22.070 --> 10:24.288
That's 350 pounds...

10:24.870 --> 10:25.996
each day.

10:26.870 --> 10:28.497
Any other questions?

10:34.420 --> 10:35.455
Close it.

10:41.510 --> 10:42.590
Get in that one.

10:42.930 --> 10:46.809
Not leaving any shit behind this time?
Goat or something?

10:49.770 --> 10:52.147
If only you had some common sense.

10:52.230 --> 10:53.606
Just a little bit.

10:54.110 --> 10:57.068
You would've turned that pig
into
carn/tas.

10:57.650 --> 10:58.890
What a waste.

10:59.530 --> 11:02.442
Already had as much Sinaloan shit
as we could swallow.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.692
Bet your brother could teach you
how to swallow more hog.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.406
What the fuck did you say?

11:10.750 --> 11:12.490
Behave yourselves, ladies!

11:15.000 --> 11:19.118
Good luck stuffing all that coke
into a raft. Motherfuckers.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.582
Get some men to follow them,
make sure they leave the city.

12:12.770 --> 12:15.341
Need to hire more fucking guys.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.396
We're not making our quota.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.064
Amado! The boss wants you.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.777
Hello. Hello?

12:32.460 --> 12:35.361
Hey! Let me know if Acosta calls back.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.998
No, not Acosta. The boss-boss.

12:39.590 --> 12:40.750
From Guadalajara.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.437
But according to Amado, we have to build.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.057
I think about four...

12:58.900 --> 13:01.027
Look at this guy.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.481
Should write up a citation.

13:04.570 --> 13:06.652
Where's your hard hat, man?

13:06.740 --> 13:08.480
Fucks up my hair.

13:09.620 --> 13:10.518
What's up, Flix?

13:11.160 --> 13:14.402
Was giving him an update
on all our progress.

13:15.460 --> 13:17.246
Things are going well.

13:17.710 --> 13:20.372
We're doing all right.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.666
Acosta was here all day yesterday.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.330
Want me to get him on the phone?

13:24.420 --> 13:26.001
I didn't come to see him.

13:26.260 --> 13:27.500
I came here to talk to you.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.421
-All right, then.
-Good to meet you, sir.

13:29.510 --> 13:32.092
Anything you ever need in Jurez,
let me know.

13:32.180 --> 13:33.716
Thank you,
comandante.

13:38.520 --> 13:39.509
Great.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.680
I always liked construction sites.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.156
Seeing things being built.

13:49.950 --> 13:52.487
You checking up on me, or what?

13:55.540 --> 13:56.825
What do you think of him?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.626
-Aguilar?
-Yeah.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.918
He's smart, ambitious...

14:05.300 --> 14:07.837
a real piece of shit.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.752
But half of the cops here
owe him their jobs.

14:12.850 --> 14:15.091
-Yeah.
-And he knows everyone, right?

14:15.180 --> 14:16.135
Yeah.

14:16.810 --> 14:20.803
Good, he can keep an eye on this
while you're away.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.061
We're going on a trip.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.606
Where the fuck to?

14:25.690 --> 14:27.817
Panama. Let's go.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.842
So you gonna tell me?
What the fuck is in Panama?

15:36.930 --> 15:41.014
Yeah. A meeting with the Colombians.
I want you there.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.646
Why Panama?

15:43.350 --> 15:45.352
Neutral territory.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.812
I made a deal with Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.
The Gulf is joining the Federation.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.231
The old man's going to be there.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.561
I'll explain the Colombians' future
to them.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.867
From now on, they pay us in product.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.991
That puts us in their business.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.877
That's the idea.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.746
Over the next six months,

16:08.840 --> 16:13.049
they'll get pushed out of the retail
cocaine business in America.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.881
The Colombians are
no longer In charge, man.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.090
It's my turn.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.182
What the fuck are you talking about?

16:24.100 --> 16:26.898
IfI control the path to market,

16:26.980 --> 16:28.356
they won't have a choice.

16:29.690 --> 16:31.146
With Matta in prison,

16:32.360 --> 16:35.238
someone will have _to take control
of transportation, right?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.826
We will run our own fleet of planes.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.446
You'll be in charge
of the whole operation.

16:42.790 --> 16:47.204
You wanted to know why you're here.
There it is. Congratulations.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.667
We'll build runways in Chiapas, Veracruz.

16:54.510 --> 16:57.468
We refuel there,
then drop the shit off in Jurez.

16:58.510 --> 17:00.466
Which becomes our main distribution hub.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.010
I told you it was important.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.517
The fucking Colombians
will work for us now.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.862
The money coming in,

17:20.700 --> 17:21.906
it makes us untouchable.

17:24.370 --> 17:27.612
How long you been working on this?

17:31.090 --> 17:32.205
My whole life.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.588
We'll control this business,
from Bogot to New York.

17:41.010 --> 17:45.765
Escobar, Cali, the fucking PRI...

17:46.440 --> 17:48.180
they will all fall in line.

17:49.690 --> 17:51.681
This transforms us.

17:52.900 --> 17:53.889
You ready for that?

17:55.110 --> 17:56.737
You bet I'm ready.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.229
Look at you.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.238
I sometimes thought
you would back out on me.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.991
Why would I back out?

18:13.250 --> 18:15.002
Sir, we are about to land.

18:15.670 --> 18:16.716
Thanks, darling.

18:18.510 --> 18:20.717
Those guys will be at the hotel
in an hour.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.007
The old man and his nephew
are meeting us there.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.840
Good work.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.889
'Mon!

18:45.660 --> 18:46.615
What?

18:47.330 --> 18:48.365
You okay?

18:52.750 --> 18:54.240
You seen Ramn today?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.799
In one of his moods.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.719
Got a call.
They told me he was in the park again.

19:05.430 --> 19:08.513
Ramn's not the one I worry about.
He's fine.

19:10.190 --> 19:14.103
You should be happy we got those Sinaloans
out of the warehouse this morning.

19:14.190 --> 19:18.604
Should've seen their faces,
packing up their shit.

19:19.150 --> 19:22.278
Couldn't handle the tax, I guess.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.526
-Yeah, impressive.
-Yeah.

19:27.410 --> 19:29.571
Don't forget Mom has that
doctor's appointment at 4:00.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.457
Make sure someone's there to take her.

19:32.290 --> 19:33.951
You can't take her?

19:35.920 --> 19:36.909
You have a date or something?

19:38.670 --> 19:40.251
-Yeah, Benjamn.
-What?

19:40.340 --> 19:43.332
That cute guy from the caf
finally asked me out.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.216
-Mr. Flix.
-Yeah.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.097
The boss will be up shortly.

21:10.180 --> 21:12.421
Good. I'll let my associates know.
Thank you.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.808
Excuse me. Everybody out,
let's go. All of you.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.356
We have to go, man.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.817
-Let me work.
-We have to go now.

21:25.570 --> 21:26.730
Almost done.

21:27.610 --> 21:28.816
Don't take long.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.941
Hey, are you done?

21:38.500 --> 21:39.876
Almost, sir.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.544
Never know who's listening.
Better to be certain.

21:43.630 --> 21:44.449
Yeah.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.968
I'm sure it is. Need to be on your toes.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.301
It's a good spot to hide a camera.

21:58.690 --> 21:59.930
Let's see.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.488
All right, then. Think you're done here.

22:11.370 --> 22:14.749
I handle security.
This is my normal routine.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.246
Excuse me, sir.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.621
Good luck with your meeting.

22:28.590 --> 22:30.046
What's your name?

22:31.220 --> 22:32.426
Salcedo.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.380
We're done, right?

22:56.950 --> 22:58.030
Reception.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.952
Connect me to Nepomuceno Guerra's room,
please.

23:04.630 --> 23:07.542
There ’5 no one under that name
checked into the hotel, sir.

23:07.630 --> 23:09.336
Okay, wait.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.792
And Juan brego,
do you have that name?

23:12.890 --> 23:13.879
One moment.

23:15.850 --> 23:16.839
We missing someone?

23:22.310 --> 23:24.972
Looks like you were expecting company.

23:32.110 --> 23:36.069
No. No, just us. Drink?

23:39.120 --> 23:43.534
Guess somebody was mistaken.

23:51.590 --> 23:52.670
Well, then...

23:54.260 --> 23:57.172
You said you had something
important to discuss.

23:58.390 --> 24:02.099
I hope so. I had to rearrange
a lot of shit to be here.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.761
Let's get the fuck out of here.

24:14.530 --> 24:15.565
Right.

24:16.370 --> 24:17.735
Well, I almost forgot.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.441
I also have something to tell you.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.918
_ We've made a deal
With one of your countrymen.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.917
He's gonna be moving powder for us too.

24:30.010 --> 24:33.502
He's a real old-timer.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.888
Like fucking Al Capone or something.

24:38.390 --> 24:41.348
Family's big in heroin,
but that's changing.

24:41.430 --> 24:42.840
Thanks to me.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.436
He's called...

24:45.350 --> 24:47.261
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

24:47.810 --> 24:49.016
Ever heard of him?

24:53.990 --> 24:54.900
Yeah.

24:55.950 --> 24:57.611
Yeah, I've heard of him.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.916
Far as I'm concerned,

25:11.050 --> 25:12.415
there's room for everyone.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.000
Mexico is a big country.

25:16.840 --> 25:17.829
Yes.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.471
So, what do you guys want?

25:31.570 --> 25:34.141
We're going to need you to send us
more product.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.786
That's why we're here.

25:49.170 --> 25:52.708
Still having problems
keeping your people happy?

25:53.260 --> 25:56.718
Making payroll can be tough.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.960
How much?

26:00.680 --> 26:02.307
As much as you can put together.

26:09.060 --> 26:10.436
Well, let's see.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.640
If we really tried,

26:15.070 --> 26:17.356
in a few months we could...

26:18.070 --> 26:22.905
put together, say, 65,000 kilos.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.361
That's what, 70 tons? More or less.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.160
That's good.

26:33.210 --> 26:34.495
That's good.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.677
But you know the deal.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.797
Once that shit leaves Colombia,
you're responsible.

26:42.890 --> 26:44.551
For every gram.

26:45.970 --> 26:50.725
Talk to your partners if you'd like,
and let me know what they decide.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.016
No.

26:54.150 --> 26:55.526
No, no need.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.817
My partners and I trust each other.

27:00.950 --> 27:02.110
We're family.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.480
Same for you, no?

27:07.160 --> 27:08.320
No.

27:08.410 --> 27:09.900
I don't have partners.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.286
That's right.

27:14.170 --> 27:14.989
Right.

27:18.130 --> 27:21.122
Since the Honduran got grabbed by the DEA,

27:21.220 --> 27:24.383
you'll have to handle transportation too.
That a problem?

27:25.850 --> 27:27.306
No problem.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.639
You know...

27:34.060 --> 27:36.472
Matta Ballesteros wasn't my partner.

27:38.110 --> 27:41.352
If he was our partner,
I'd be asking questions

27:41.450 --> 27:45.819
about how he got busted
after all this time in the game.

27:49.950 --> 27:51.531
He wasn't family.

27:52.830 --> 27:54.627
So it's not my business.

27:57.130 --> 27:58.506
ButI liked him.

27:59.420 --> 28:00.660
He was cool.

28:02.760 --> 28:03.636
Yes.

28:08.890 --> 28:12.303
Well, my partners like making money.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.188
So this deal works out, they'll be happy.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.107
And if it doesn't, then...

28:19.530 --> 28:23.489
well, we'll see what happens next.

28:28.580 --> 28:30.116
By the way, I didn't catch your name.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.826
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

28:34.710 --> 28:36.837
Amado Carrillo Fuentes.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.581
I won't forget it.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.587
I like knowing who transports
my merchandise.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.968
It will be a pleasure to work with you
as well, Amado.

28:51.060 --> 28:52.971
Okay, gentlemen.

28:56.150 --> 28:57.185
See you later.

28:57.730 --> 28:59.140
Excuse us, gentlemen.

29:32.350 --> 29:34.727
What the fuck, Flix?

29:35.390 --> 29:38.188
How are we going to move
that much coke?

29:38.270 --> 29:40.431
What was I supposed to do?
There was no choice.

29:40.520 --> 29:45.731
If we fuck up 65,000 kilos,
that's a death sentence.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.907
Fucking Guerra, that motherfucker.

29:54.580 --> 29:57.037
I need planes to move that amount,
and we don't have any.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.451
Then get some, Amado.

29:58.540 --> 29:59.746
Get them.

30:19.230 --> 30:22.063
-He//o.
-You made a mistake today, old man.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.647
Miguel ngel, my boy.

30:24.730 --> 30:29.440
You caught me with my apron on again.
I'm making supper for the little ones.

30:29.530 --> 30:31.657
Look, as things turn out,

30:32.160 --> 30:34.537
I decided not to go through
with the arrangement.

30:34.910 --> 30:38.402
I know you're moving coke
for the Colombians now.

30:38.870 --> 30:39.825
Well...

30:40.460 --> 30:43.623
you were so convincing, I couldn't resist.

30:44.550 --> 30:46.165
We had a fucking deal!

30:46.260 --> 30:47.716
I wouldn't go so far as that.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.509
:Listen to me--.
-/Vo, you //sten to me, M/gue/ ngel,

30:52.010 --> 30:54.308
You have high-profile problems.

30:55.310 --> 30:57.767
And I'm a quiet man, by nature.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.551
Any problems I have had,

31:00.650 --> 31:03.858
I've dealt with them. You know that.

31:03.940 --> 31:09.606
And I commend you on that, I really do,
but I have to wonder...

31:10.990 --> 31:13.151
how long would I have lasted,

31:13.240 --> 31:16.949
once you got what you wanted
from the Colombians?

31:18.500 --> 31:20.957
Your partners seem to have histories

31:21.040 --> 31:23.782
which are short and tragic, Miguel ngel.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.666
In the end, let's just say...

31:26.880 --> 31:29.587
I prefer to tend my own garden.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.389
Stop talking about my fucking partners!

31:32.760 --> 31:34.887
You like Rome so much, right?

31:34.970 --> 31:38.724
I'm going to nail your fat ass
onto a cross, you piece of shit!

31:38.810 --> 31:41.768
I'm going to hang you like a pig
so that your filthy grandchildren

31:41.850 --> 31:43.727
can watch you bleed out
in your fucking ranch!

31:43.810 --> 31:45.562
Then I’ll burn it to the ground!

31:45.650 --> 31:48.141
Something tells me that won't happen.

31:49.190 --> 31:50.350
M/gue/ ngel. . .

31:50.820 --> 31:51.946
Life...

31:52.700 --> 31:55.942
is a long journey with a map
written by a fool.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.782
We never know as much as we think...

32:02.290 --> 32:03.279
do we?

34:59.550 --> 35:01.290
Tell me something goon; Cochi

35:02.680 --> 35:04.591
How'd the brothers take it?

35:05.430 --> 35:06.670
Any bullshit?

35:06.770 --> 35:08.169
All good.

35:08.850 --> 35:12.604
Fucking dogs have been on us
since we left Tijuana.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.067
What about the other thing?

35:20.490 --> 35:21.730
Pretty good.

35:21.820 --> 35:25.608
Blew a fuse on the ventilator,
but it'll be all right.

35:26.370 --> 35:27.359
All good?

35:28.790 --> 35:30.610
Fucking hot today.

35:30.710 --> 35:33.281
Tell me about it. Heat is a bitch.

35:33.380 --> 35:34.449
Listen to me.

35:34.540 --> 35:37.259
We don ’t need one of those workers
dy/ng on us, man.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.204
Of course not.

35:38.300 --> 35:41.087
The fuck? Why haven't you fixed it?

35:41.630 --> 35:43.848
-7'he fan?
-Yes, goddamn it!

35:44.350 --> 35:46.500
Just needs an industrial cord.

35:46.600 --> 35:50.593
Chapo says he found one,
but the prices in Tijuana, man...

35:51.230 --> 35:53.892
But I found a guy that'll give it to us

35:54.110 --> 35:56.396
for half what the stores in town
are selling it at.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.062
You hear that; Hector? Half-off

35:59.610 --> 36:02.659
Just fix the fucking fan, Cochi!

36:04.820 --> 36:05.946
Fine.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.861
Guess Lupita's not giving it
to him enough.

37:09.470 --> 37:10.505
We need air, boss.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.840
Breathe slower.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.556
Fucking hell.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.186
How's the cable coming?

37:25.990 --> 37:27.981
It's coming! It's coming!

37:31.200 --> 37:32.189
Hurry!

37:32.950 --> 37:34.531
We're suffocating here!

37:36.170 --> 37:38.161
Connect that fucking cable!

37:38.670 --> 37:39.659
Fuck.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.165
Two hundred kilos just like that.

39:50.550 --> 39:54.463
The gringos didn't even look their way.
Our people either.

39:54.550 --> 39:56.131
It was brilliant, Enedina.

39:58.890 --> 40:00.596
But we're going to have a problem.

40:03.480 --> 40:04.549
What?

40:07.730 --> 40:09.812
We're going to need more coke.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.526
A lot more.

40:17.410 --> 40:19.617
I'm going to introduce you to my contact
in Colombia.

40:24.750 --> 40:25.910
It's time, partner.

42:06.390 --> 42:10.099
This guy is fucking my girl.
Fucking bullshit.

42:11.900 --> 42:13.856
Well, she's so fine, I don't blame him.

42:13.940 --> 42:16.738
Shut up, man. Don't fuck with me too.

42:18.570 --> 42:23.860
I'm always being made a fool of,
and you still got to fuck with me.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.821
Here are your fucking cigarettes.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.740
Fuck this guy.

43:55.130 --> 43:57.451
This your move all along,
comandante?

44:54.850 --> 44:56.852
The old fucker's not stupid.

44:56.940 --> 44:58.646
He knows what I can do to him.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.351
Find out why he's not afraid.

45:02.320 --> 45:06.154
When I land in Guadalajara, tell me
what the fuck he's got in his back pocket.

45:08.030 --> 45:09.076
Got it.

45:21.210 --> 45:22.586
What the fuck did you say?

45:23.800 --> 45:24.926
They built a what?

45:34.730 --> 45:35.549
Ramn!

45:44.320 --> 45:45.947
Get some men.

46:14.270 --> 46:15.726
What the fuck's that?

46:35.450 --> 46:36.530
Don't move, asshole!

46:47.880 --> 46:49.461
How many men are down there?

46:51.430 --> 46:54.137
Boss. What the fuck was that?

46:57.390 --> 46:59.221
They've stopped working down there.

47:04.110 --> 47:05.316
Get them up here.

47:05.900 --> 47:07.640
Let's go, guys.

47:08.780 --> 47:10.771
Move it!

47:18.250 --> 47:20.992
Sinaloan motherfuckers need to learn.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.495
Turn that fucking thing on.

47:56.790 --> 47:59.702
This is bullshit. Dump it faster!

48:00.160 --> 48:02.537
You can't, boss. Doesn't work like that.

48:03.750 --> 48:04.910
Fuck this.

48:05.590 --> 48:07.046
Take that away.

48:07.130 --> 48:08.836
Okay, get the other shit.

48:12.510 --> 48:13.465
So...

48:14.260 --> 48:16.251
all your guys out?

48:19.810 --> 48:21.846
Guess we'll find out.

48:36.870 --> 48:38.155
Get out of here!

48:44.330 --> 48:46.412
Move it! Move!

49:01.060 --> 49:02.721
What do we do, boss?

50:18.680 --> 50:20.921
What is it? What's he got?

50:21.010 --> 50:22.170
It's not good.

50:29.600 --> 50:31.101
Who the fuck is this guy?

50:31.860 --> 50:34.067
Budget secretary.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.198
PhD from Harvard. Father was a senator.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.110
Why do I care?

50:41.200 --> 50:43.691
He's going to be the next president
of Mexico.

50:47.250 --> 50:49.912
Hasn't been announced,
but he's been tapped by the PRI.

50:50.960 --> 50:53.918
Zuno's arrest in the US
made too much noise.

50:54.250 --> 50:56.627
The party doesn't want a candidate
who's got a nephew

50:56.720 --> 50:58.085
sitting in an American prison.

50:59.050 --> 51:03.749
So our fat friend in Mexico City
isn't getting the nomination.

51:03.850 --> 51:04.965
You're sure?

51:05.060 --> 51:06.550
The new guy,

51:06.640 --> 51:07.925
as a kid,

51:08.940 --> 51:11.477
spent summers at the coast.

51:11.980 --> 51:13.220
In Matamoros.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.220
Where his father, the senator,

51:16.940 --> 51:19.352
was close friends with
a leading local busmessman,

51:20.070 --> 51:22.061
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

51:22.160 --> 51:25.652
So you want to know what Guerra has
in his back pocket?

51:26.500 --> 51:28.616
The next president of Mexico.

51:31.630 --> 51:34.497
Guerra's been playing you the whole time.

51:34.590 --> 51:35.796
Old-timers. ..

51:36.880 --> 51:38.336
they don't fuck around.

51:39.090 --> 51:40.296
Have to admire it.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.842
Fuck admiring it.

51:43.930 --> 51:46.637
I need everything you can get
on that bald asshole.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.267
-There's something else.
-What?

51:49.180 --> 51:50.761
Some shit went down in Tijuana.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.551
A tunnel turned up,
running under the border.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.483
Still trying to pin down more,
but it's bad.

51:58.570 --> 52:00.231
Motherfuckers.

52:06.870 --> 52:07.985
Hey, boss.

52:10.710 --> 52:11.859
How was the trip?

52:35.020 --> 52:36.009
Going home, sir?

52:38.230 --> 52:41.529
Go to the apartment at Parque Lineal.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.406
Very good.

53:22.070 --> 53:23.856
Clavel!

53:28.280 --> 53:31.989
Sir, are you okay? Remain calm.
We're getting everything under control.

53:32.080 --> 53:35.243
_ _ Please remain calm. _
Stay in5ide while we secure the perimeter.
