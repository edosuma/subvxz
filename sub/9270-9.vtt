WEBVTT

00:03.719 --> 00:05.460
Shot!

00:13.180 --> 00:14.650
Something to eat, your ladyship?

00:14.700 --> 00:18.330
No, thank you. I'm saving my
palate for the wine-tasting.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.130
And why doesn't that surprise me?

00:20.180 --> 00:23.380
Careful, Anthony! We're
not running the Derby!

00:24.020 --> 00:26.250
Is that the reclusive colonel?

00:26.300 --> 00:29.340
He looks like a hero from
an H. Rider Haggard novel.

00:30.340 --> 00:34.610
In that case, does that make Lady
Edna She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.770
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:36.820 --> 00:40.170
welcome to the launch of
our first official vintage.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.700
If you'd like to follow me to the
winery, we shall begin the tour.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.330
Oh, heads!

00:53.100 --> 00:54.700
Well stopped.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.220
Here it comes!

00:59.180 --> 01:00.610
Not joining us for the tour?

01:00.660 --> 01:03.850
The colonel don't want
the likes of me there.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.170
Enjoy.

01:08.740 --> 01:11.290
Let me introduce Gregoire Bisset,

01:11.340 --> 01:14.180
the rising star of
French viniculture.

01:15.820 --> 01:19.010
Gregoire has helped me transform
our little patch of England

01:19.060 --> 01:21.570
into a vineyard to rival
the finest in Europe,

01:21.620 --> 01:25.210
one of only three wine estates
in the whole country.

01:25.260 --> 01:27.570
And he speaks excellent English,

01:27.620 --> 01:31.380
so we don't have to rely
on my schoolboy French.

01:34.420 --> 01:35.450
Erm...

01:35.500 --> 01:37.370
So here's the press room,

01:37.420 --> 01:40.520
where we extract the juice
from the new harvest.

01:42.940 --> 01:44.620
Et, er...

01:45.820 --> 01:50.180
we grow Seyval blanc which creates
a beautiful white juice.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.740
I show you...

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.060 --> 02:11.130
I thought he said white.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.560
This is wrong...

02:59.540 --> 03:01.280
Was it your dog?

03:03.540 --> 03:05.280
It was my son's.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.100
Bacchus was a present
to Tom from the colonel.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.810
Find Tom and keep him away.
He shouldn't see this.

03:11.860 --> 03:13.490
Yes, Mrs Grayson.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.410
Shall I take you back
to the house, Lady Edna?

03:16.460 --> 03:18.660
I think that would be best.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.370
I think we could all
do with some fresh air.

03:21.420 --> 03:24.970
An excellent idea. We shall
continue with the tour.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.220
Tom!

03:29.700 --> 03:31.240
Where's Tom?

03:31.930 --> 03:32.930
Went inside.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.450
Stay away from him.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.100
You'll fill his head with mischief.

03:37.940 --> 03:40.940
He's a young lad. His head's
already full of mischief.

03:42.540 --> 03:46.060
Anyway, he's the only one round
here who don't think I'm scum.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.650
Want some?

03:49.700 --> 03:50.890
Pinched that?

03:50.940 --> 03:54.370
Colonel don't mind. There's plenty
more where that came from.

03:54.420 --> 03:55.850
You'll get in trouble.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.640
I don't think so.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.890
Why don't you come and join me? We
could erm... have a little party.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.140
~ No, thanks.
~ Why not? Huh?

04:05.260 --> 04:07.450
Prefer your men a bit
more continental?

04:07.500 --> 04:09.100
You're drunk.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.240
I just want a cuddle.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.850
Here, see?

04:14.900 --> 04:18.010
~ You're desperate to get your hands on me.
~ No! Let go of me!

04:18.060 --> 04:20.060
What's the matter, eh?

04:20.620 --> 04:21.760
No!

04:23.380 --> 04:24.610
Urgh!

04:24.660 --> 04:26.260
You vicious...

04:29.140 --> 04:31.970
Unfortunately, we must battle
the English weather.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.130
~ I've heard of hair of the dog, but...
~ Shh!

04:34.180 --> 04:35.530
The key is irrigation.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.570
With good irrigation, we can
transform water into wine.

04:38.620 --> 04:41.330
Who would do such a
thing to a poor dog?

04:41.380 --> 04:43.980
It was Henry Gibbs, I'm telling you.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.770
Er, could you excuse me for
a moment? Just carry on.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.300
One second.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.730
Over here we have a... a
small area of Pinot blanc.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.850
Bit of an experiment...

04:57.900 --> 04:58.970
What happened?

04:59.020 --> 05:00.770
Gibbs.

05:00.820 --> 05:01.850
What did he do?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.500
He tried to...

05:05.540 --> 05:07.610
I'm sorry. You're busy.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.130
Tea?

05:15.180 --> 05:17.780
Tea is for gossip. Brandy for shock.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.570
Oh, careful with that decanter.

05:21.620 --> 05:23.850
Wedding present from my late husband.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.970
Oh.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.820
Along with this...

05:27.820 --> 05:29.330
That is beautiful.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.720
Contains the key to his heart.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.610
I must confess to an ulterior
motive in getting you alone.

05:38.660 --> 05:42.490
Oh, forgive me, Father, my
defrocking days are long gone.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.260
More raisin than grape, nowadays.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.530
I wanted to have a chat.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.090
You have not been to Mass for months.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.170
Well, I... lose track of the days.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.210
I er...

05:55.260 --> 05:58.000
And my Anthony's too
busy to drive me.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.500
Hardly surprising, dealing
with a saboteur.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.690
Criminals everywhere.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.970
The country's going to the dogs.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.450
If you'll excuse the pun.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.490
Hmm.

06:09.540 --> 06:12.410
Well, your son is a colonel.
He'll look after you.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.000
SHE CHUCKLES

06:14.540 --> 06:17.170
Don't you let that
eye patch fool you.

06:17.220 --> 06:20.170
He got that walking behind
his father's horse as a boy.

06:20.220 --> 06:22.160
Anthony was in the...

06:23.780 --> 06:25.210
What's it? The...

06:25.260 --> 06:27.530
The diplomatic corps.

06:27.580 --> 06:30.730
The real army couldn't get
rid of him quick enough.

06:30.780 --> 06:31.770
Would you?

06:31.820 --> 06:33.490
After you...

06:33.540 --> 06:36.460
So kind. I can't wait to taste it.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.660
Let me know if you'd
like to place an order.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.850
Has Mother offended
you? Because erm...

06:49.900 --> 06:52.640
She was a little
agitated, that's all.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.970
She's not been quite herself of late.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.770
Exhaustion probably. She's
having trouble sleeping.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.170
Have you consulted a doctor?

07:02.220 --> 07:04.290
All "avaricious quacks", apparently.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.540
Mmm.

07:06.780 --> 07:11.050
I've tried talking to her but
erm... she doesn't make it easy.

07:11.100 --> 07:14.130
My punishment for spending
two decades abroad.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.730
I'm the prodigal son
trying to make amends.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.770
I have a book that might help.

07:18.820 --> 07:22.220
Priests must be familiar with the
idiosyncrasies of older people.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.890
Shall I drop it round tomorrow?

07:25.940 --> 07:27.740
I'd appreciate it.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.260
Erm... is there anything
else you'd like help with?

07:32.580 --> 07:33.610
The dog...

07:33.660 --> 07:35.650
Ah, I've heard you're
a bit of a sleuth.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.010
No. Erm...

07:37.060 --> 07:39.930
That is a problem I
can deal with myself.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.850
~ Until tomorrow, then.
~ Tomorrow.

07:56.540 --> 07:58.250
What on earth were
you trying to achieve?

07:58.300 --> 08:00.810
I told you. I want a
share of the vineyard.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.650
Half my harvest was in that vat.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.210
There won't be a vineyard
if you carry on like this!

08:05.260 --> 08:07.130
Then give me what I want.

08:07.180 --> 08:08.930
I spilt blood for this country.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.410
I deserve my piece
of it as much as you.

08:11.460 --> 08:14.250
And how would I explain
that to Lady Edna?

08:14.300 --> 08:17.130
That I've given part of our estate
away to a stranger, a labourer.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.850
Not my problem.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.610
Look, I'm trying to help you here.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.330
You're the one who said that
you can't afford to pay me off.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.850
But if you'd prefer to
give me the money...

08:26.900 --> 08:28.610
You've crossed a line.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.730
I want you gone. Today.

08:32.659 --> 08:34.600
You sure about that?

08:38.620 --> 08:41.169
I've tolerated you for long enough.

08:41.220 --> 08:44.920
Don't presume to know what sort
of man you're dealing with.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.100
Leave.

08:54.620 --> 08:57.020
I'll be back for what I'm owed!

09:02.700 --> 09:03.730
Thank you, Father.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.050
So, Father, you got any leads?

09:06.100 --> 09:07.450
Woof! Woof!

09:07.500 --> 09:10.370
That's not funny, Sid! Poor Tom.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.730
First of all, he lost
his father in the war

09:12.780 --> 09:15.090
and then somebody goes
and murderers his dog.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.540
Father...

09:17.460 --> 09:18.930
Don't you want it?

09:18.980 --> 09:21.980
I prefer my wine with
a little less... body.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.660
~ Hmm.
~ Good night.

09:29.620 --> 09:31.090
HONKS HORN

09:35.100 --> 09:36.770
WINDOW SHATTERS

09:48.180 --> 09:49.700
PISTOL SHOT

09:51.940 --> 09:53.410
PISTOL SHOT

09:54.980 --> 09:56.620
BIRDS CAW

10:44.100 --> 10:45.640
Henry Gibbs?

10:48.180 --> 10:51.610
Before you say anything, I'm
just here to see the colonel.

10:51.660 --> 10:54.700
Just don't get involved
and don't get in my way.

10:56.180 --> 10:57.920
Have you seen...?

10:58.180 --> 11:00.520
~ Yes.
~ Yes, of course you have.

11:02.980 --> 11:04.720
CLEARS HIS THROAT

11:06.940 --> 11:09.010
What do you think, sir?

11:09.740 --> 11:12.700
Two gunshots, only one entry wound.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.530
Bruising to his neck.

11:15.580 --> 11:17.250
So...

11:17.300 --> 11:19.370
Struggle for the weapon.

11:19.820 --> 11:22.490
Gun goes off, hitting the side table.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.970
Gibbs is overpowered by the killer,

11:26.020 --> 11:28.220
shoots him at close range.

11:28.780 --> 11:31.650
And the bullet passes
through the body...

11:33.660 --> 11:36.000
.. before hitting the mirror.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.860
Curious corbelling.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.770
Gibbs was well-built.

11:54.820 --> 11:58.090
So, I'd say our suspect
is probably male,

11:58.140 --> 11:59.530
fit,

11:59.580 --> 12:01.690
possibly with combat training.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.810
Anything else I can do?

12:05.060 --> 12:08.220
Could you offer my mother some words
of comfort when she wakes up?

12:09.180 --> 12:12.450
She was disturbed by the commotion,
found the whole thing very upsetting.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.700
I gave her something to help
her get back to sleep.

12:16.780 --> 12:19.860
Father, if you wouldn't
mind leaving us?

12:27.020 --> 12:29.620
I'd like to check some basic facts.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.490
We told your colleague.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.810
We heard two gunshots in the night.

12:33.860 --> 12:36.090
We all went to my study
and found the body.

12:36.140 --> 12:38.570
~ What more do you need to know?
~ Who arrived first?

12:38.620 --> 12:39.890
I did.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.720
Lord have mercy!

12:43.170 --> 12:44.170
He's dead.

12:44.220 --> 12:45.290
Shall I call the police?

12:45.340 --> 12:47.280
Erm, yes, of course.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.520
~ The police.
~ The labourers' wages are gone!

12:54.900 --> 12:56.330
Oh...!

12:56.380 --> 12:59.410
Your bedroom's nearest the study and
yet you were the last one to arrive.

12:59.460 --> 13:02.810
I checked on her ladyship
first. She was still asleep.

13:02.860 --> 13:04.330
Only, I must have disturbed her

13:04.380 --> 13:06.090
because next thing, she's downstairs

13:06.140 --> 13:07.530
and all screaming the place down.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.330
Lady Edna was
understandably distressed.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.010
Gibbs was killed by a handgun.
Is there one on the premises?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.330
No.

13:14.380 --> 13:16.970
I've ordered a search of the
house and grounds, just in case.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.330
Surely it was just
a burglary gone wrong?

13:19.380 --> 13:21.850
Are you suggesting that
Gibbs disturbed a burglar?

13:21.900 --> 13:23.330
I'm suggesting he WAS one.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.970
In that case, it's hardly
likely that he shot himself.

13:26.020 --> 13:28.330
~ Maybe he had an accomplice?
~ Exactly!

13:28.380 --> 13:30.930
The other fellow shot Gibbs and
then ran off with the money.

13:30.980 --> 13:33.570
Possible. The missing money
wasn't with Gibbs' belongings.

13:33.620 --> 13:37.620
But that doesn't mean the accomplice
isn't someone in this room.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.210
How well did you all know the victim?

13:40.260 --> 13:42.850
Miss Fletcher probably knew him
better than the rest of us.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.640
That ain't true!

13:45.380 --> 13:47.180
He was...after me.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.290
I told him I weren't interested.

13:49.340 --> 13:50.530
None of us knew him.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.610
He came here looking for work and
has been nothing but trouble since.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.330
In fact, I went to see him yesterday
and told him to move on.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.050
Did you indeed?

13:59.380 --> 14:00.490
Well, that'll be all.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.530
The sergeant will take
your fingerprints.

14:02.580 --> 14:06.180
Until we find our killer, no-one
is to leave the estate.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.250
Don't you remember anything?

14:11.300 --> 14:14.060
I think I... had a bad dream.

14:15.660 --> 14:18.500
We had a break-in, Mother, remember?

14:19.820 --> 14:21.170
I er...

14:21.220 --> 14:24.160
.. think I would like
to be left in peace.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.800
Perhaps a breath of fresh air?

14:27.980 --> 14:29.570
Very well.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.220
I'll be back to check on you later.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.440
So, did you meet Gregoire
on your travels?

14:38.220 --> 14:39.930
No, after I came back.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.050
I er...

14:41.100 --> 14:44.300
.. needed help here, so
I placed an advertisement.

14:44.940 --> 14:47.370
Gregoire turned up like
a gift from Dionysus

14:47.420 --> 14:50.420
with a reference from a
top vineyard in Bordeaux.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.490
Do you still have the reference?

14:53.540 --> 14:56.570
Only, the Kembleford Wine
Appreciation Society

14:56.620 --> 14:59.290
would be very keen to know
more about our Gallic friend.

14:59.340 --> 15:00.770
Done.

15:00.820 --> 15:02.610
I'll dig it out for you.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.400
He's a good chap,
take my word for it.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.650
Er, Mrs McCarthy...

15:09.060 --> 15:12.420
.. noticed a hint of romance
between Gregoire and Emily.

15:13.820 --> 15:15.050
Did she now?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.330
He's certainly keen.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.650
As for her, I wouldn't know.

15:21.860 --> 15:23.810
What about Gibbs?

15:23.860 --> 15:25.650
An itinerant labourer.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.650
Arrived a few weeks ago.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.170
First time I'd laid eyes on him.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.460
Inspector! I've found something!

15:37.260 --> 15:38.330
Ah...

15:38.380 --> 15:39.890
Well done, Sergeant.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.730
Good work.

15:41.780 --> 15:43.520
An Enfield No.2.

15:43.940 --> 15:47.040
Standard issue British
Army service revolver.

15:47.820 --> 15:50.620
Mark one double star.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.810
Not in production until 1942.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.570
I was in Africa by then.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.130
Anyway, I've always
preferred the Webley.

15:58.180 --> 16:01.210
Those later Enfields don't
have a safety on the hammer.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.610
Tend to go off if you have
to hit the deck in a hurry.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.170
You seem to know a lot about guns,

16:05.220 --> 16:07.570
considering you're a member
of the diplomatic corps.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.560
One picks things up.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.080
If you'll excuse me?

16:14.660 --> 16:16.010
Still here, Father?

16:16.060 --> 16:17.770
Er...

16:17.820 --> 16:20.690
~ Er, yes. God's work, never done.
~ Mm-hm...

16:25.260 --> 16:26.730
Thank you.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.740
Mrs Grayson, is it true you
have access to the safe?

16:35.820 --> 16:38.210
Colonel and I both have keys.

16:38.260 --> 16:40.650
I've done the accounts since
the old master's day.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.970
For the vineyard as well?

16:43.020 --> 16:45.530
Right now that's just a very
long list of expenses.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.890
The vineyard's not making any money?

16:47.940 --> 16:49.940
Well, it's early days.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.170
I'd like to see the books, if I may?

16:53.220 --> 16:56.650
I'll get them for you when
I've finished preparing lunch.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.730
The Met are on the telephone, sir.
They've got something for you.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.720
Very good, Sergeant.

17:02.140 --> 17:03.880
~ Oh...
~ Hands off!

17:16.900 --> 17:19.240
Must have been distressing...

17:19.579 --> 17:21.650
.. seeing his dead body.

17:22.220 --> 17:23.890
I know what you're
getting at, Father,

17:23.940 --> 17:26.410
but there weren't nothing between us.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.690
Now, please, I'm already behind.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.490
Ah, Miss Fletcher...

17:30.540 --> 17:33.650
~ Would you excuse us, please, Father?
~ Oh, stay.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.610
I know what you coppers are like.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.970
I imagine you do. I've just
had an interesting chat

17:38.020 --> 17:40.530
with a colleague down at
the Metropolitan Police.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.050
You've quite a colourful history.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.250
Trespass.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.290
Theft.

17:45.340 --> 17:46.770
Soliciting.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.890
You try living on the streets,
bombs falling all around,

17:49.940 --> 17:51.810
parents six feet under.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.800
I did what I had to.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.730
Common assault.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.330
Gibbs had a bite mark on his hand.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.320
Oh, he had it coming!

18:02.100 --> 18:04.650
Well...I never shot nobody.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.690
Yeah, I bit him, so what?

18:06.740 --> 18:09.740
I was defending myself.
He was... trying it on.

18:10.740 --> 18:11.770
Trying what on?

18:11.820 --> 18:13.560
Oh, Inspector...

18:14.060 --> 18:17.010
I think we both know
what she means by that.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.130
Did you report this?

18:19.180 --> 18:21.890
I told the colonel. Said
he'd ask Gibbs to leave.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.730
I don't know what took him so long.

18:23.780 --> 18:27.770
Well, Gibbs used to joke that
the colonel would never fire him

18:27.820 --> 18:30.250
because they were old
army buddies, but...

18:30.300 --> 18:31.490
They served together?

18:31.540 --> 18:34.380
I doubt it. Gibbs was a born liar.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.410
Look, the colonel is a good man,

18:38.460 --> 18:39.690
a hero.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.730
He saved my life the
first time I met him.

18:42.780 --> 18:46.090
One night, in Farringdon,
not long after the war,

18:46.140 --> 18:48.770
three lads dragged me down an alley.

18:48.820 --> 18:51.530
The colonel's walking past, hears
me scream and comes running,

18:51.580 --> 18:53.050
scares them off.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.130
He gave me this job to
get me off the streets.

18:55.180 --> 18:56.730
A hero, indeed.

18:56.780 --> 18:58.450
Three against one.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.810
How did he scare them off?

18:59.860 --> 19:02.060
Well, he had his gun, so...

19:09.380 --> 19:12.730
Colonel, I have a few more questions
regarding the murder of Henry Gibbs.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.780
If you'd like to accompany
me to the station...

19:19.860 --> 19:21.200
KNOCKING

19:24.020 --> 19:25.580
Anthony...

19:37.820 --> 19:39.450
I'm afraid your son's not here.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.100
Of course not.

19:41.940 --> 19:44.290
I'll never see my boy again.

19:44.340 --> 19:46.090
I'm sure that's not true.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.410
It is!

19:49.780 --> 19:51.490
Would you pray for him, Father?

19:51.540 --> 19:53.490
I will.

19:53.540 --> 19:57.420
And I will do everything I can
to help him, I promise you.

20:20.540 --> 20:23.450
Is there anything else
I can do to help?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.840
Oh, thank you, we'll be fine.

20:26.940 --> 20:30.330
Monsieur Bisset is driving me into
Kembleford shortly. Would you like a lift?

20:30.380 --> 20:32.170
I'm sure your bicycle
would fit in the back.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.290
That would be very kind.

20:36.380 --> 20:39.930
~ Is the colonel to be
expected back for dinner?
~ How should I know?

20:39.980 --> 20:42.610
~ Sorry, I...
~ What have I told you about
wearing your hair down?

20:42.660 --> 20:45.660
~ I lost my ribbon.
~ Well, then, cut a new one.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.890
Shall we see you outside, Father?

20:54.140 --> 20:55.740
Five minutes.

21:23.620 --> 21:24.690
47 seconds.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.100
SNIFFS

21:42.740 --> 21:45.140
Always had a thing about fires.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.770
My grandfather told me that, if you
stare at the flames for long enough,

21:50.820 --> 21:53.620
you might catch a glimpse
of the Devil.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.520
Did you?

21:59.220 --> 22:00.820
No. Not today.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.720
We're leaving, so...

22:07.380 --> 22:08.650
SNIFFS

22:10.060 --> 22:12.130
Gibbs' military records.

22:13.460 --> 22:17.490
He spent six months guarding
the same temporary base in Tunis

22:17.540 --> 22:19.410
in which you were stationed.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.970
Along with hundreds of
other men, no doubt.

22:22.020 --> 22:25.130
It's mere coincidence that he turned
up in Kembleford? Admit it.

22:25.180 --> 22:27.520
~ You knew Gibbs all along.
~ No.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.730
You asked him to leave. Did he agree?

22:33.020 --> 22:34.410
Reluctantly.

22:34.460 --> 22:37.250
Did you have to threaten
him with your gun?

22:37.300 --> 22:39.250
Like I said, that gun was...

22:39.300 --> 22:42.400
Easy enough to get into
the hands of an officer.

22:44.220 --> 22:46.290
The safe wasn't forced.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.930
Only you and Mrs Grayson have a key.

22:48.980 --> 22:51.570
But she has an alibi.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.690
Gregoire saw her leaving the room
after the gunshots were fired.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.530
How could I have dumped
the gun in the pond

22:56.580 --> 22:58.050
and still been first on the scene?

22:58.100 --> 23:01.050
You could have hidden it, then
taken it to the pond later.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.490
And my motive?

23:02.540 --> 23:03.930
Money.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.570
Get your old army buddy
to help stage a burglary,

23:06.620 --> 23:08.690
claim on the insurance.

23:13.140 --> 23:15.080
The estate accounts.

23:16.540 --> 23:18.290
You're broke.

23:18.340 --> 23:20.970
I'm guessing that Gibbs got
greedy in the last minute,

23:21.020 --> 23:22.490
demanded a larger cut.

23:22.540 --> 23:25.050
There was an argument
and you killed him.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.840
Weak speculation.

23:27.340 --> 23:30.130
I've sent the gun off to
forensics for fingerprints.

23:30.180 --> 23:32.720
Let's see what turns up, shall we?

23:35.300 --> 23:38.400
Could you telephone Lady
Felicia for me, please?

23:39.860 --> 23:42.210
Ask her to speak to her friend
at the Foreign Office

23:42.260 --> 23:44.410
and see what she can find
out about the colonel?

23:44.460 --> 23:47.580
So, do you think the colonel
murdered Henry Gibbs?

23:48.540 --> 23:50.490
My ideas are still fermenting.

23:50.540 --> 23:54.410
Either way, I made a promise to
Lady Edna to discover the truth

23:54.460 --> 23:56.660
and I intend to honour it.

23:56.980 --> 23:59.290
Oh, but where are you off to now?

23:59.340 --> 24:00.450
To the police station.

24:00.500 --> 24:04.000
I'm sure the colonel will need
some spiritual guidance.

24:05.260 --> 24:08.250
Oh, and I nearly forgot, while
you're on the telephone,

24:08.300 --> 24:10.970
please tell Sid I have a job for him.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.970
Thank you.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.330
Why are you here?

24:20.380 --> 24:23.130
Because I promised your mother
I'd do what I could.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.130
A waste of time.

24:25.180 --> 24:27.050
The inspector's determined
to see me hang.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.650
If you're telling the truth, you'll
need to have faith and be patient.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.570
~ Are you?
~ I swear to you, I didn't kill Gibbs.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.690
That's not what I asked.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.940
Do you believe it's
always wrong to lie?

24:42.380 --> 24:43.970
Even if it's for a greater good?

24:44.020 --> 24:45.650
Interesting question.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.690
St Augustine argues that
a lie is never justified

24:48.740 --> 24:53.330
and yet, in the Bible, Rahab lies to
save the lives of two Jewish spies

24:53.380 --> 24:55.130
and is herself spared from death.

24:55.180 --> 24:57.010
What do you think?

24:57.060 --> 24:59.170
I think that if you have
something to confess,

24:59.220 --> 25:02.420
you had better do it now
while you have the chance.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.300
It would be in strictest confidence.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.010
There's nothing to tell.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.690
You have no idea who killed Gibbs?

25:10.740 --> 25:11.970
~ None at all.
~ Because...

25:12.020 --> 25:13.620
You should go.

25:14.540 --> 25:17.780
Very well. But in my experience,
the truth will always out.

25:19.380 --> 25:21.330
I suppose it's a question
of intention.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.920
Are you lying to protect yourself?

25:24.660 --> 25:26.400
Or someone else?

25:39.260 --> 25:40.860
Psst! Father!

25:44.100 --> 25:45.410
What are you doing here?

25:45.460 --> 25:47.930
Well, you told me to follow them.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.250
I wanted you to follow
them in Kembleford,

25:55.300 --> 25:57.130
not loiter around their house.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.320
You've got to see this...

25:59.980 --> 26:02.370
So, when I was in town, Gregoire
or whatever his name is,

26:02.420 --> 26:04.010
goes to get a broken headlight fixed.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.650
I'm thinking, hang about, why's
he got a broken headlight?

26:06.700 --> 26:08.640
Look under the front.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.620
Father?

26:20.460 --> 26:21.490
Father...!

26:21.540 --> 26:23.410
What exactly are you doing?

26:23.460 --> 26:25.810
Well, I've always been
fascinated by cars.

26:25.860 --> 26:28.090
You know, transmissions,

26:28.140 --> 26:30.010
differentials, that sort of thing.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.400
Really?

26:32.100 --> 26:33.890
I got your message.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.890
I understand you found Gregoire's
letter of recommendation.

26:36.940 --> 26:39.930
~ The colonel mentioned
that you wanted to see it.
~ Thank you.

26:39.980 --> 26:42.490
~ Would you like a cup of tea?
~ No, no, no.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.940
I won't trouble you any longer.

26:47.860 --> 26:50.330
I would never have thought that.

26:51.060 --> 26:53.890
~ What?
~ She looks every inch
the respectable war widow.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.410
Sid, what?

26:56.020 --> 26:59.050
Right, the Frog's gone in the garage,
she's popped in the bank.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.810
Oh, and you are acquainted with
a certain young bank clerk.

27:02.860 --> 27:05.450
We may have exchanged
pleasantries in the past.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.040
There you go. Have a bash on that.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.330
Check out her name.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.930
What's that?

27:17.980 --> 27:20.580
Gregoire's letter of recommendation.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.040
Oh, so it's the Frenchman now?

27:23.580 --> 27:25.090
Mrs Grayson gave him an alibi.

27:25.140 --> 27:26.130
Oh...

27:26.180 --> 27:27.650
PHONE RINGS

27:35.420 --> 27:36.450
Father Brown.

27:36.500 --> 27:40.290
Sullivan here. I need you to come
to the police station, Father.

27:40.340 --> 27:42.330
The colonel has just
tried to hang himself.

27:42.380 --> 27:43.850
Right away.

27:44.740 --> 27:47.330
I have to return to
the police station.

27:47.380 --> 27:50.780
You're not going anywhere
until you've heard my news.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.740
I'd been in to see him
a few minutes before.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.500
May I ask why?

28:00.140 --> 28:02.530
We found two sets of
prints on the revolver.

28:02.580 --> 28:04.650
One of them belonged to him.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.290
I told him he was going
to be charged with murder.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.810
Who did the other set belong to?

28:10.180 --> 28:11.290
We don't know yet.

28:11.340 --> 28:12.810
Why have you sent for me?

28:12.860 --> 28:15.450
Yes, well, the colonel wants
to save us the bother

28:15.500 --> 28:17.900
of sending him to the scaffold.

28:18.460 --> 28:21.610
So, for once, our professional
interests coincide.

28:21.660 --> 28:24.370
It's your duty to stop him
committing a mortal sin

28:24.420 --> 28:26.890
and mine to see him stand trial.

28:29.980 --> 28:31.730
I'd like you to talk to him.

28:31.780 --> 28:33.250
Stop him from trying again.

28:33.300 --> 28:34.330
You think he will?

28:34.380 --> 28:35.610
We've taken his sheets

28:35.660 --> 28:38.650
but, as you know, there are many
ways for a man to kill himself.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.570
I'll do what I can.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.500
At least this should
put your mind at rest.

28:47.620 --> 28:48.730
How so?

28:48.780 --> 28:51.450
Always a sign of a guilty conscience.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.650
Forgive me, Father.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.700
I was in a dark place.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.130
Then let in God's light.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.050
Open up your heart.

29:10.780 --> 29:12.980
How did you lose your eye?

29:14.100 --> 29:15.850
A riding accident.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.970
I... I fell and my horse kicked out.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.490
Your horse?

29:20.180 --> 29:22.780
Lady Edna said it was your father's.

29:23.130 --> 29:24.130
I...

29:24.180 --> 29:26.650
You know what her memory's like.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.050
Take off your eye patch.

29:30.660 --> 29:31.860
What?

29:32.780 --> 29:35.410
You told your guests that you
only had schoolboy friendships,

29:35.460 --> 29:36.730
which is puzzling

29:36.780 --> 29:39.380
for a diplomat stationed in Tunisia.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.890
And you were telling the truth
about not knowing Gibbs

29:41.940 --> 29:44.940
until he arrived at the
estate, weren't you?

29:45.140 --> 29:47.930
Whereas Colonel Forbes-Leith would
have seen him a hundred times.

29:47.980 --> 29:49.520
Take it off.

29:49.980 --> 29:51.180
Why?

29:52.140 --> 29:53.930
Because, according
to the Foreign Office,

29:53.980 --> 29:57.180
the real Colonel Forbes-Leith
died in Tunis...

29:57.860 --> 29:59.330
.. in 1945.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.760
Who are you?

30:11.340 --> 30:12.970
Joseph Hawkins,

30:13.020 --> 30:14.690
Sergeant,

30:14.740 --> 30:17.660
25762751.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.520
Pleased to meet you.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.410
I met him in hospital.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.200
The real colonel.

30:28.580 --> 30:31.250
For a month, he kept talking
about this crazy plan

30:31.300 --> 30:34.090
to build a vineyard on
his estate back home.

30:34.140 --> 30:38.370
We didn't even realise how similar we looked
until one of the nurses got us mixed up.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.850
You stole his identity?

30:39.900 --> 30:41.650
Stole?

30:41.700 --> 30:43.440
It was his idea.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.960
He knew he was dying.

30:46.620 --> 30:49.930
He got me to practise his voice,
taught me about his family,

30:49.980 --> 30:51.580
his childhood.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.840
He gave you his life.

30:55.420 --> 30:56.620
Why?

30:59.260 --> 31:02.290
He wanted someone to
build his vineyard,

31:02.340 --> 31:04.140
carry on his name.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.090
He wanted his mother to have a son.

31:07.140 --> 31:08.730
I'm an orphan.

31:08.780 --> 31:10.720
No family to miss me.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
It was my chance to become
something better.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.680
Water into wine.

31:18.180 --> 31:21.010
When the fever finally took him,

31:21.060 --> 31:24.140
I got a friend to intercept
the telegram to the estate.

31:25.740 --> 31:28.980
All I needed was his eye patch
and a... spare uniform.

31:31.140 --> 31:34.370
But surely Lady Edna realised
that you weren't her son?

31:34.420 --> 31:36.210
He wrote me a letter to give her,

31:36.260 --> 31:39.460
just in case, explaining his reasons,
but... I never needed it.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.810
And she'd not seen him
for decades, remember?

31:42.860 --> 31:44.290
He was just a lad when he signed up.

31:44.340 --> 31:45.940
Hello, Mother.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.330
She's always been a few
grapes short of a bunch.

31:52.380 --> 31:53.850
It was such chaos after the war,

31:53.900 --> 31:56.410
it was easy enough to
fudge the paperwork.

31:56.460 --> 32:00.340
So no-one in Kembleford knew that
Colonel Forbes-Leith was dead?

32:02.100 --> 32:05.100
It was all going well
until Gibbs turned up.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.820
Knew the colonel, he said.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.850
He was going to spill the beans, so
I offered him a job to keep him sweet.

32:10.900 --> 32:12.840
But it wasn't enough.

32:14.940 --> 32:17.410
I've killed a lot of men, Father.

32:18.140 --> 32:20.540
I can tell you about every one.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.970
But I didn't kill Gibbs.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.680
I heard the gunshots and er...

32:26.940 --> 32:28.730
.. I found him in the study,

32:28.780 --> 32:30.380
already dead.

32:31.420 --> 32:32.890
With Emily.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.330
She was in a such a state.
I told her to hide the gun.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.650
I thought, without it, the
police would have no proof,

32:38.700 --> 32:40.290
not if we kept our mouths shut.

32:40.340 --> 32:41.650
She admitted killing him?

32:41.700 --> 32:44.490
No, she didn't have to. Her hands
were covered in his blood.

32:44.540 --> 32:46.890
And you will hang to protect her?

32:46.940 --> 32:49.530
Gibbs was only there because of me.

32:49.580 --> 32:51.090
She was attacked because of my lies.

32:51.140 --> 32:53.490
No wonder she took matters
into her own hands.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.290
But if she was defending herself...

32:55.340 --> 32:57.610
With her past, nobody'd believe her.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.890
I won't risk it.

32:58.940 --> 33:01.530
Tell the truth. You can
still save yourself.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.730
Are you talking about
my soul or my neck?

33:03.780 --> 33:05.380
Both, perhaps.

33:05.980 --> 33:07.290
Let me tell the inspector.

33:07.340 --> 33:08.570
No.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.090
No, this is what I deserve.

33:10.140 --> 33:12.480
Why are you determined to die?

33:14.700 --> 33:16.810
You said it yourself.

33:16.860 --> 33:18.930
The truth will come out.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.410
The only people who've
ever cared for me

33:21.460 --> 33:23.930
will discover what a fraud I am.

33:23.980 --> 33:26.980
How could I look Lady
Edna in the eye again?

33:27.620 --> 33:29.810
The shame is unbearable.

33:29.860 --> 33:32.860
The shame is because
you're wearing a mask.

33:34.740 --> 33:36.770
Take it off.

33:36.820 --> 33:39.020
Let them know who you are.

33:39.820 --> 33:42.160
But everything I am is a lie.

33:43.060 --> 33:45.450
YOU built the vineyard.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.700
YOU looked after them
all for all those years.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.930
Let them remember Joseph Hawkins.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.010
Can't promise they'll believe you.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.660
That depends.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.610
Where is the letter that Colonel
Forbes-Leith gave you

34:04.660 --> 34:06.600
to give to Lady Edna?

34:07.100 --> 34:10.010
It's in a hidden compartment
at the bottom of the safe.

34:10.060 --> 34:12.260
Same place I kept the gun.

34:16.340 --> 34:17.810
No letter.

34:27.380 --> 34:28.449
PISTOL SHOT

34:28.500 --> 34:29.969
DOOR OPENS

34:30.860 --> 34:33.010
~ Father?
~ Requiescat in pace.

34:33.060 --> 34:35.600
~ What are you doing in here?
~ Amen.

34:37.860 --> 34:40.130
Special prayer for the dead.

34:43.100 --> 34:46.739
I wonder if I might have a word
with everyone in the drawing room?

34:51.900 --> 34:53.170
He ain't no colonel?

34:53.219 --> 34:54.850
This is not possible.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.090
He's a charlatan?

34:56.139 --> 34:58.610
Oh, don't be too quick to judge.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.610
You've all sought to
transform yourselves.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.010
Didn't you,

35:03.060 --> 35:04.660
Miss Maitland?

35:05.420 --> 35:06.930
Miss?

35:06.980 --> 35:09.720
You said your old
man died in the war.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.040
My George did die in the war!

35:13.420 --> 35:16.220
But...we were never actually married.

35:17.540 --> 35:19.210
I met him just before
he left for France.

35:19.260 --> 35:21.450
One night together and then...

35:21.500 --> 35:24.410
Father, is there a reason
you wish to humiliate me?

35:24.460 --> 35:25.850
Yes.

35:25.900 --> 35:29.700
Because the truth, in its
entirety, could save that man.

35:30.740 --> 35:33.610
I don't see how. So
I took George's name.

35:33.900 --> 35:37.300
I didn't want everyone judging
Tom for my foolishness.

35:37.500 --> 35:41.570
But I have been entirely loyal
to Lady Edna and the colonel.

35:41.620 --> 35:42.930
Of course you have.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.810
They took you and your son
in when others wouldn't.

35:45.860 --> 35:47.050
And when you saw the chance

35:47.100 --> 35:49.130
of saving their estate
from financial ruin,

35:49.180 --> 35:51.180
you had no hesitation.

35:52.780 --> 35:55.180
The labourers' wages have gone!

35:55.700 --> 35:58.370
Knowing that the insurance
would pay the money back,

35:58.420 --> 36:00.020
"Mrs Grayson"

36:00.500 --> 36:03.370
deposited the money in
the estate's account...

36:03.420 --> 36:05.330
... under "income from wine sales".

36:05.380 --> 36:09.060
But, of course, we know that not
a single bottle was sold yesterday.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.650
I warned the colonel,
or whoever he is,

36:12.700 --> 36:16.210
a hundred times that we were on a
knife-edge, but he wouldn't listen.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.250
~ But this is beside the point.
I certainly didn't kill anyone.
~ No.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.900
But there is a killer in this room.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.840
Isn't there?

36:28.020 --> 36:29.690
Yes, all right.

36:30.380 --> 36:31.690
I confess.

36:31.740 --> 36:33.290
Monsieur Bisset!

36:33.340 --> 36:35.810
But, please, it was an accident.

36:37.340 --> 36:39.370
He just ran in front of the car.

36:39.420 --> 36:40.490
The car?

36:40.540 --> 36:42.450
He just lay there...

36:42.500 --> 36:43.690
What are you on about?

36:43.740 --> 36:44.770
Bacchus.

36:44.820 --> 36:46.300
Tom's dog.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.170
Oh, dear.

36:53.220 --> 36:56.730
I tell you what. Cos I like
you, I'll get rid of the body.

36:56.780 --> 36:59.450
Get that headlight fixed and the
colonel will be none the wiser.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.770
They'll think he ran away.

37:00.820 --> 37:02.090
What will you do with him?

37:02.140 --> 37:05.140
I know just the place.
Pop him on the back.

37:06.900 --> 37:10.490
Then you burned your shirt
in case anybody saw the blood.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.010
The colonel would have fired me.

37:13.220 --> 37:15.330
Please, I love my job.

37:15.380 --> 37:17.170
Nobody would pay me to make wine.

37:17.220 --> 37:18.570
Mmm.

37:18.620 --> 37:21.940
Gregoire's qualifications
were somewhat exaggerated.

37:22.980 --> 37:25.090
I don't think Sergeant
Hawkins speaks French

37:25.140 --> 37:27.850
because this letter appears
to commend your talents

37:27.900 --> 37:30.240
as a reliable delivery driver.

37:31.020 --> 37:33.850
It was a misunderstanding.
I just needed a job.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.370
And I showed the letter
to the colonel and...

37:36.420 --> 37:38.450
He seemed to think that I...

37:38.500 --> 37:40.850
Well... the next thing I knew,

37:40.900 --> 37:42.450
I was his vigneron.

37:42.500 --> 37:45.650
So you know nothing
about making wine?

37:45.700 --> 37:49.600
I found a book in a second-hand
shop. It's been most helpful.

37:53.540 --> 37:56.250
But yours is, perhaps,
the greatest lie of all.

37:56.300 --> 37:59.170
You were first to the
study, weren't you?

38:01.620 --> 38:04.220
I found Gibbs. He weren't breathing.

38:06.220 --> 38:08.450
I told the colonel that
I wanted Gibbs dealt with.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.970
I didn't think he'd kill him.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.850
Get rid of it,

38:11.900 --> 38:13.330
then wash your hands.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.010
Say nothing.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.460
Yes, sir.

38:17.060 --> 38:20.060
So, you agreed to hide the
revolver to help the colonel.

38:21.620 --> 38:23.250
He changed my life.

38:23.300 --> 38:27.460
The colonel, sergeant, I don't care
what he is, I'd still be on the
streets if it weren't for him.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.900
But he thinks you killed Gibbs.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.130
What?!

38:32.180 --> 38:35.380
How would you have known
how to get into the safe?

38:35.780 --> 38:38.450
Still less that the
revolver was in there?

38:38.500 --> 38:40.450
No. It wasn't you.

38:40.500 --> 38:42.170
Two shots.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.490
I think the first shot
was an accident.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.660
Somebody dropped the Enfield No.2

38:49.780 --> 38:51.520
and it misfired.

38:52.140 --> 38:54.210
Somebody frail.

38:54.260 --> 38:56.200
Somebody frightened.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.770
They then managed to pick
the revolver back up

38:58.820 --> 39:01.340
and shoot Gibbs dead.

39:03.860 --> 39:05.800
What's in the locket?

39:06.500 --> 39:08.970
The key to your husband's heart?

39:09.220 --> 39:10.810
Oh!

39:10.860 --> 39:12.530
My little joke.

39:13.980 --> 39:16.520
My husband had the safe installed.

39:17.500 --> 39:20.100
All he really cared about was money.

39:28.380 --> 39:30.520
What happened last night?

39:36.300 --> 39:38.810
I heard a noise. Somebody
breaking in.

39:38.860 --> 39:40.490
So...

39:40.540 --> 39:42.210
.. I went to get the gun.

39:42.260 --> 39:43.850
Anthony...

39:43.900 --> 39:46.170
Oh, Sergeant Hawkins, is it?

39:46.540 --> 39:50.490
.. told me that he kept one in the
safe, to reassure me, I suppose.

39:50.540 --> 39:51.810
But...

39:53.180 --> 39:55.570
.. the gun wasn't the
only thing I found.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.290
I recognised the handwriting
straight away.

39:58.340 --> 40:00.610
Anthony always did funny Hs.

40:01.220 --> 40:02.960
DOOR CREAKS OPEN

40:06.700 --> 40:09.410
~ Don't worry, I'm just
here for what I'm owed.
~ Get out!

40:09.460 --> 40:11.410
Get out or I'll call my son!

40:11.460 --> 40:13.570
Your son is dead, old woman.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.020
And you will be next unless
you keep your mouth shut!

40:29.780 --> 40:31.780
But, then, you know...

40:32.540 --> 40:35.170
.. I think I always knew

40:35.220 --> 40:37.650
Sergeant Hawkins wasn't

40:37.700 --> 40:39.170
my Anthony.

40:41.620 --> 40:45.820
Perhaps it was easier to go along
with it than to accept the truth?

40:47.980 --> 40:50.120
My son is dead, isn't he?

40:51.060 --> 40:52.260
Yes.

40:54.420 --> 40:57.050
But why didn't you tell
the truth straightaway?

40:57.100 --> 41:00.300
Nobody would have blamed
you. It was self-defence.

41:01.900 --> 41:04.940
I wanted that impostor
to take the blame.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.980
He lied to me!

41:08.780 --> 41:10.290
And he should hang for that?

41:10.340 --> 41:12.130
Shouldn't he?

41:12.180 --> 41:13.330
When you think about it,

41:13.380 --> 41:16.860
Sergeant Hawkins has dedicated his life
to fulfilling your son's dying wish.

41:18.020 --> 41:21.020
He built up his vineyard,
he looking after you.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.690
I do not agree with the deception,

41:23.740 --> 41:26.540
but neither do I think
him an evil man.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.200
Do you?

41:38.460 --> 41:39.810
Rise and shine.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.690
Am I going to court?

41:41.740 --> 41:43.680
Somebody's confessed.

41:43.930 --> 41:44.930
Emily?

41:44.980 --> 41:46.530
No. Lady Edna.

41:46.580 --> 41:47.890
You're not serious?

41:47.940 --> 41:50.450
The second set of prints
on the gun belonged to her.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.570
She's not being charged, either.

41:52.620 --> 41:55.560
Apparently it was
reasonable self-defence.

41:56.020 --> 41:57.450
I'll explain everything later.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.140
But, meanwhile, there are some people
who want to meet Joe Hawkins.

42:08.340 --> 42:09.770
Welcome home, sir.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.360
Thanks, Tom.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
Welcome home, Colonel.

42:18.500 --> 42:19.570
Call me Joe.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.090
And er...

42:21.140 --> 42:23.480
.. I was only ever a sergeant.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.290
Congratulations.

42:33.340 --> 42:35.880
I wondered how long it would take.

42:38.660 --> 42:40.330
Thank you, sir.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.610
Nothing to say for yourself?

42:54.660 --> 42:57.140
Forgive me, Lady Edna.

42:58.820 --> 43:02.130
My intention was never to
dishonour your son's name,

43:02.180 --> 43:04.650
only to honour his love for you.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.440
Sentimental claptrap!

43:07.940 --> 43:10.090
Listen, whoever you are,

43:10.140 --> 43:12.210
you've carried me up
and down these stairs,

43:12.260 --> 43:14.970
listened to me wittering on for hours

43:15.020 --> 43:17.820
and kept this old pile
of stones going.

43:18.940 --> 43:21.540
Whatever charade brought you here...

43:22.700 --> 43:24.640
.. this is your home.

43:27.220 --> 43:30.210
But let's have no more
of this sergeant nonsense.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.890
Colonel's much better.

43:31.940 --> 43:35.050
Whoever's going to buy wine
from Sergeant Hawkins?

43:35.100 --> 43:36.500
Huh?

43:37.305 --> 43:43.704
