THAT YOUR DAUGHTER RAN AWAY?

03:49.863 --> 03:52.633
- SHE MUST HAVE.
SHE LIVES WITH MY EX.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.268
I JUST GOT BACK

BUT, UH, NEW YORK IS ALL VICKI
EVER TALKED ABOUT.

- YEP.

04:06.814 --> 04:11.752
MY DAUGHTER VICKI

04:11.785 --> 04:13.721
THAT CALL--

04:13.754 --> 04:16.890

GROUNDED.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.072
YOU HAVE TO FIND MY DAUGHTER.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.744
- MY WIFE SENT YOU
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.413
WHY DON'T WE GET YOU
SOME WATER?

04:39.447 --> 04:41.549

MY EX TELLS ME VICKI

04:46.820 --> 04:48.656
MAYBE A BOYFRIEND, A--

04:48.689 --> 04:50.558
- WE SKYPE.
SHE NEVER MENTIONED ONE.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.825
- [crying]
WHERE'S VICTORIA?

04:51.859 --> 04:52.993

05:15.383 --> 05:16.584
IT WAS
A THROWAWAY.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.989
IF VICKI PICKS UP, WE'LL BE
ABLE TO TRACE HER LOCATION.

05:25.593 --> 05:26.994
[cell phone rings]
- I THINK JOAN NEVER GOT OVER

05:27.027 --> 05:30.398
WHAT HAPPENED TO ST. JOHN,
NOT BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION,

05:30.431 --> 05:32.833
BUT BECAUSE OF BETHANY.

07:12.600 --> 07:20.608
*

08:00.748 --> 08:01.782
- YOU HAD
TO ARREST HER?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.251
- LOOK, YOUR DAUGHTER'S
NOT ACTUALLY UNDER ARREST.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.719
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO GET HER OUT OF THERE.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.787
- VICKI'S
IN NINTH GRADE.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.523
SHE DIDN'T DO THIS
ON HER OWN.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.658
SHE'S A VICTIM,

08:10.691 --> 08:12.726
SO WE JUST WANT TO FIND THE MAN

TO SEE HER.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.565
- SHE SAID THAT SHE'S NOT READY
TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.132
- LET ME SEE HER.
SHE'LL TALK TO ME.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.770
- SHE'S MORE LIKELY
TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED

08:22.803 --> 08:23.937
WITHOUT HER FATHER
IN THE ROOM.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.039
- YOU TWO CAN BE THERE
FOR HER LATER.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.242
RIGHT NOW, LET US
TALK TO HER...ALONE.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.751

- WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING?
- ARRESTING YOUR ASS.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.831
- Y'ALL ARE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.733
SHE'LL NEVER SAY
A WORD AGAINST ME.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.967
I OWN THAT BITCH.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.772
- WELL, THAT'S NICE.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.108
TRE BOUGHT IT
FOR YOU?

09:01.141 --> 09:04.244
WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER
HE HAD YOU SLEEP

09:04.277 --> 09:05.846
WITH ONE
OF HIS FRIENDS?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.916
- TRE LOVES ME.
- VICKI.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.719
WHAT TRE DID TO YOU--
THAT'S NOT LOVE.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.855
YOUR PARENTS--
THEY LOVE YOU.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.757
- MY DAD CAME HOME
FROM A TOUR IN IRAQ

09:16.790 --> 09:18.792
AND SIGNED UP FOR ANOTHER ONE
JUST TO GET AWAY FROM US.

YOUR FATHER

09:20.260 --> 09:23.664
THE MORNING HE CAME IN.
HE WAS WORRIED SICK.

09:23.697 --> 09:27.768
- UH-HUH. MY MOM THINKS
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE OVER THERE.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.909
- BUT SHE'S NOT READY
TO GIVE TRE UP.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.378
SHE WANTS TO BELIEVE
HE'S IN LOVE WITH HER.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.648
- THESE ROMEO PIMPS
DO THEIR THING, MAN.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.650
THEY HAVE
THE GIRLS BRAINWASHED.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.252
- HOW DO WE
TURN HER BACK?

09:45.285 --> 09:49.256
- GUY LIKE THAT HAS GOTTA HAVE
SOMETHING ON THE SIDE.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.659
LET'S CHECK HIM OUT
ONLINE.

09:56.964 --> 10:02.335
- SO TRE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT HIS BABY MAMA?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.337
- [crying]
NO.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.306
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO HIS APARTMENT

10:06.339 --> 10:10.210
OR SEEN
WHERE HE LIVED?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.980
- WE ALWAYS STAY
AT HOTELS.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.784
- WELL, HE...
LIVES WITH THIS WOMAN...

10:16.817 --> 10:19.653
AND TWO OF HIS CHILDREN
IN BROOKLYN.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.725
- HE CALLED ME
HIS HONEY DOVE.

10:29.997 --> 10:33.734
- [whispering]
VICKI.

10:33.767 --> 10:38.005
TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.840
- THIS GIRL'S BEEN TURNED OUT
FOR TWO WEEKS,

10:39.873 --> 10:40.974
FORCED TO HAVE SEX
WITH DOZENS OF MEN.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.443
- RELAX, WE'RE NOT CHARGING HER.
AND WE'VE GOT THE PIMP.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.377
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH
TO PUT HIM AWAY

10:44.411 --> 10:46.680
ON SEX TRAFFICKING CHARGES
FOR 25 YEARS.

10:46.714 --> 10:49.783
- WHAT ABOUT THE JOHNS?

10:49.817 --> 10:51.251
WHAT ABOUT TRE'S FRIENDS?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.020
- SHE IS UNDERAGE,
SO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM'S

10:53.053 --> 10:54.855
A RAPIST UNDER THE LAW.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.790
- DON'T START THAT AGAIN.
- SO CHARGE THE JOHNS.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.792
IT'S NOT VICTIMLESS.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.127
- NO, BUT IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.796
- NOT IF WE DO A STING.

11:04.364 --> 11:05.866
- COUNSELOR, WE'VE GOT
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.101
YOU WANNA STOP
TEENAGE PROSTITUTION,

11:08.135 --> 11:10.303
PROSECUTE THE JOHNS.
SEND A MESSAGE.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.344
- AND THIS PIMP--HE'S JUST
GONNA GIVE UP ALL HIS CLIENTS?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.146
- THAT DUDE'S
JUST A TADPOLE.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.750
HE TURNED VICKI.
LET ME TURN HIM.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.086
JURIES LIKE THE EASY CASES.
THEY GET TO GO HOME EARLY.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.855
- Y'ALL ARE JUST
BLUFFING ME.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.823
NOBODY'S GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT THAT WHORE SAYS.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.859
- HMM.
THE JURY WILL.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.894
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.228
- TRYING TO GIVE YOUR CLIENT
A CHANCE.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.365
- HE HELPS US, WE HELP HIM.
- I DON'T SNITCH.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.902
- HOLD ON, TRE.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.072
- SEX TRAFFICKING,
KIDNAPPING, RAPE.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.340
YOU'RE LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL
OF A LIFE SENTENCE.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.311
YOU CUT FOR THAT,
PLAYER?

11:51.344 --> 11:53.781
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.785
NOW YOU ABOUT TO DO
SOME HEAVY TIME FOR SOME TRICKS.

11:57.818 --> 11:58.919
I NEED A NAME.

11:58.952 --> 12:03.857
LET'S START WITH SOMEONE
YOU DON'T LIKE.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.934
- LOOK, AMIGO,
I'LL PAY THE FINE.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.335
I GOT A SITTER HOME
WITH MY KIDS.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.870
LET ME GET OUT
OF HERE.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.471
- OH, YOU'RE
IN FOR A LONG NIGHT...

12:18.505 --> 12:19.807
AMIGO.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.474
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.777
- THANK YOU.
- THIS IS WORTH IT.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.913
ONE MORE AND WE'RE OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.050
SEVEN DOWN,
ONE TO GO.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.852
- HOW'S YOUR UNDERCOVER
HOLDING UP?

12:31.885 --> 12:33.353
SHE'S GOOD.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.955
I TOLD HER THIS
IS HOW I GOT MY SHIELD.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.257
- IS THAT TRUE?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.792
- SON OF A BITCH.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.528
- IS THAT JAKE STANTON?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.831
- JAKE STANTON?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.899
- OH, DON'T TELL ME
HE'S KNOCKING ON HER DOOR.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.036
[knock at door]

12:49.069 --> 12:51.438
- SORRY.
WHO'S JAKE STANTON?

12:51.471 --> 12:54.074
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:54.107 --> 12:58.912
BEST QUARTERBACK
SINCE JOHNNY UNITAS.

12:58.946 --> 13:02.515
20 YEARS AGO, THIS GUY
WAS KING OF NEW YORK.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.220
- YOU KNOW WHO I AM, DARLING?
- SHOULD I?

13:07.254 --> 13:09.890
- YEAH, I WAS PRETTY FAMOUS
BACK IN THE DAY.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.526
1990.
THAT WAS MY BIG YEAR.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.830
YOU REALLY NEED
ALL THOSE CLOTHES?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.334
WELL...
[sighs]

13:21.368 --> 13:23.904
MY KNEES, MY BACK,
I TELL YOU WHAT,

13:23.937 --> 13:25.138
THEY AIN'T WHAT
THEY USED TO BE.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.908
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, I WOULD'VE
GIVEN YOU ONE HELL OF A RUN,

13:27.941 --> 13:32.279
BUT, UH, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
DOING ALL THE WORK.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.849
ALL YOU'VE GOTTA DO IS JUST
TAKE ME ALL THE WAY HOME.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.150
- SURE, HANDSOME.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.585
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A BIG PARTY.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.490
- POLICE!
- THE HELL'S GOING ON?

13:43.523 --> 13:46.559
WELL...[chuckles]
I'M SORRY, DARLIN'.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.328
- UH, NO,
WE'RE NOT ARRESTING HER.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.429
WE'RE ARRESTING YOU.
- ME?

13:49.462 --> 13:50.263
- AGAINST THE WALL.
- FOR WHAT?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.900
- PATRONIZING A PROSTITUTE
FOR NOW.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.571
- BIG GUY,
YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.373
- COME ON.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.576
- SO I DRAW BACK
TO PASS AND BOOM!

14:03.610 --> 14:06.313
I GET HEAD-SLAPPED.
RATTLES MY HELMET.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.481
I'M ON THE GROUND,
BUT SOMEHOW,

14:08.515 --> 14:12.219
I DON'T KNOW HOW, I JUST--
I GET OFF A PERFECT SPIRAL.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.588
GREATEST PASS OF MY CAREER,
AND I NEVER SAW THE DAMN THING.

14:15.622 --> 14:21.161
THEN, TWO OF THE BIG UGLIES,
UH, UH...KRAVITZ AND DRAKE--

14:21.194 --> 14:23.596
- KRAGTHORP AND DRAKE,
YOUR LINEMEN.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.999
- YEAH, KRAGTHORP.
HIM TOO.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.901
- NICE JOB OUT THERE.

14:27.935 --> 14:31.204
THE STING COUPLED WITH TRE
AND VICTORIA'S TESTIMONY?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.073
- DON'T THANK US,
THANK TRE.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.574
THE LITTLE BITCH
SUNG LIKE CARUSO.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.543
- VICTORIA I.D.ed JAKE
AND THE SEVEN OTHER JOHNS.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.411
A D.A. CAN CHARGE THEM
WITH RAPE TWO.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.913
- WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.915
- NO WORRIES, BIG GUY.
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

14:41.949 --> 14:46.119
- JAKE, WHY DON'T YOU,
UH, COME WITH ME?

14:46.153 --> 14:48.688
- PUT HIM
IN INTERROGATION ALONE.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.590
HE'S HELD COURT ENOUGH.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.494
- OH, UH...

14:54.527 --> 14:57.664
I'M, UH,
SUPPOSED CALL MY WIFE.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.968
GOT ME
ON A SHORT LEASH.

15:01.001 --> 15:04.671
[sighs] I KNOW WHAT
SHE'S GONNA SAY.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.705
- WHAT'S THAT?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.942
- SAME THING
SHE ALWAYS SAYS--

15:08.976 --> 15:12.612
"GET A LAWYER."
[chuckles]

15:12.645 --> 15:15.448
- YEAH,
ALL RIGHT.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.516
YOU CAN CALL
YOUR WIFE.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.551
- THANK YOU,
MA'AM.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.192
- HE HAD NO WAY
OF KNOWING HER AGE.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.726
THIS IS ALL
ENTRAPMENT.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.362
- NO ONE FORCED OR COERCED
MR. STANTON INTO THE ACT.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.498
WE WILL ALSO SHOW
THIS IS NOT HIS FIRST OFFENSE.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.633
- YOUR HONOR, THE D.A.'S OFFICE
IS RUSHING TO JUDGMENT

15:33.666 --> 15:35.335
BECAUSE OF MY CLIENT'S
HIGH PROFILE.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.470
JAKE STANTON'S WIFE
HAS ALREADY AGREED

15:37.504 --> 15:39.739
TO PUT UP THEIR HOME
IN NEW JERSEY AS BOND.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.208
- I AGREE.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.710
MR. STANTON HAS SIGNIFICANT TIES
TO THE COMMUNITY

15:43.743 --> 15:45.645
AND DOES NOT POSE
ANY FLIGHT RISK.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.615
BAIL IS SET IN THE AMOUNT
OF $50,000.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.717
[gavel bangs]

15:51.751 --> 15:52.952
- THANKS.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.995
- THERE ARE 16 NEWS VANS
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.563
- GOOD. YOU WANTED
TO SEND A MESSAGE.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.432
WHEN JAKE STANTON
GOES DOWN FOR RAPE,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.300
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.635
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M GEORGIA STANTON,

16:08.668 --> 16:09.769
JAKE'S WIFE.
COULD I TALK TO YOU?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.604
- MRS. STANTON,
I'M SURE YOU'RE UPSET,

16:11.638 --> 16:13.573
BUT WE DID NOT SET OUT
TO TRAP YOUR HUSBAND.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.275
- BET YOU'RE GLAD
YOU CAUGHT HIM.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.545
GET TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH.
- HOLD ON.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.780
THIS WASN'T
A ONE-TIME MISTAKE.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.616
TWO WEEKS AGO,
YOUR HUSBAND PAID FOR SEX

16:23.650 --> 16:27.420
WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
AND SHE'S GOING TO TESTIFY.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.222
I'M SURE THAT
THAT'S TOUGH TO BELIEVE--

16:29.256 --> 16:31.591
- I'M NOT SAYING
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

16:31.624 --> 16:35.328
I'M JUST SAYING, IF HE DID,
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.400
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T FOLLOW.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.570
- JAKE HASN'T BEEN
THE SAME RECENTLY.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.205
MOST NIGHTS
AFTER 6:00,

16:45.238 --> 16:48.441
MY HUSBAND HAS NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.688
IN THE HUDDLE, I SAY,
"JAKE, YOU'RE BLEEDING."

17:01.721 --> 17:04.791
HE RUBS SOME DIRT IN HIS NOSE,
SAYS, "IS THAT BETTER?"

17:04.824 --> 17:07.194
NEXT PLAY, NO ONE'S OPEN,
HE TAKES OFF RUNNING,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.096
DRAGGING THREE GUYS
WITH HIM

17:09.129 --> 17:11.098
ACROSS THE LINE
FOR THE FIRST DOWN.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.599
- HE BROKE HIS NOSE
AND TWO RIBS IN THAT GAME.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.101
KEPT ON PLAYING.
- THAT WAS A MAGICIAN.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.469
I REMEMBER WATCHING HIM
ON TV COMING UP.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.438
HE'D SLIP PRESSURE,
SCRAMBLE.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.806
I'D FEEL SORRY
FOR THOSE CORNERBACKS

17:19.839 --> 17:21.341
ONCE HE GOT FREE
IN THE SECONDARY.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.643
- HOW MANY CONCUSSIONS
DID THIS GUY GET?

17:23.676 --> 17:25.778
- YEAH, I KNEW WHEN HE
STEPPED OFF THE ELEVATOR,

17:25.812 --> 17:28.181
HE'S--
HE'S NOT ALL THERE.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.749
- ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S
A LITTLE PUNCH-DRUNK.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.251
IT DOESN'T EXCUSE
WHAT HE DID.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.819
- KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I GOT HIT IN THE HEAD

17:32.852 --> 17:35.155
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP?
- I HESITATE TO ASK.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.523
- NO, BUT IT--
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.291
AND THE LEAGUE
IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.826
THEY'RE CHANGING
THE RULES ON HITS.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.562
THEY'RE BRINGING IN NEUROLOGISTS
TO CLEAR THE INJURED PLAYERS.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.832
- OKAY, SYMPTOMS OF C.T.E.,
OR "PUGILISTIC DEMENTIA,"

17:45.865 --> 17:50.337
INCLUDE CONFUSION,
MEMORY PROBLEMS.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.405
POOR JUDGMENT IS A HALLMARK
OF THE DISEASE.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.407
- HOW ABOUT CALLING
A PIMP BACK TWICE

17:54.441 --> 17:55.208
AND HAVING SEX
WITH A TEENAGER?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.676
IS THAT ON YOUR LIST
OF SYMPTOMS?

17:56.709 --> 18:00.213
- NEW YORK'S HERO
OUT ON BAIL TWO HOURS AGO

18:00.247 --> 18:03.116
JUST EXPOSED HIMSELF
TO A WOMAN IN A BATHROOM

18:03.150 --> 18:05.718
AT THE WEST BANK CAFE.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.322
- THESE DAMN BATHROOM SIGNS
THESE DAYS, TRYING TO BE CLEVER.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.724
I MEAN, YOU GOT THESE LITTLE
PICTURES ON THE DOORS--

18:11.758 --> 18:13.660
- JAKE, JAKE, JAKE, JAKE.
I'M CALLING OUR LAWYER.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.828
- HE FOLLOWED ME
INTO THE LADIES' ROOM

18:15.862 --> 18:18.131
AND TOOK IT OUT.
I SCREAMED.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.168
- AND WHAT DID HE DO?
- HE JUST STOOD THERE.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.902
LIKE HE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY I WAS SCREAMING.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.371
CREEP.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.406
- I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
A LADIES' ROOM, YOU KNOW?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.574
YOU WALK INTO THESE PLACES,
AND IT'S DARK--

18:27.607 --> 18:29.309
- JAKE, JAKE,
QUIET!

18:29.342 --> 18:32.145
- HEY, HEY, YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO YOUR WIFE.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.152
- HEY, GUYS.
HOW Y'ALL DOING?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.288
- RIGHT THIS WAY,
BIG GUY.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.860
- YOU KNOW,
VINNY THE CHIN

18:47.894 --> 18:50.630
WALKED LITTLE ITALY
IN HIS PAJAMAS,

18:50.663 --> 18:53.200
CONVINCED THE JURY
HE WAS CRAZY.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.467
MAYBE JAKE'S
GOT A PLAN.

18:54.501 --> 18:57.804
- LOOK, I SAW A FOOTBALL PLAYER
TRY TO USE AN INSANITY DEFENSE.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.207
THE DIFFERENCE HERE, FROM
EVERYTHING THAT THE WIFE SAID,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.475
IS JAKE'S RECENT BEHAVIOR IS
COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.578
- JUST HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT OVER HERE.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.354
- WE CAN'T TRAVEL
ANYMORE.

19:14.387 --> 19:18.625
LAST TIME, I FOUND HIM
IN OUR HOTEL HALLWAY NAKED.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.193
HE'D LOCKED
HIMSELF OUT.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.794
EVEN IF WE GO
TO HIS BROTHER'S HOUSE,

19:21.828 --> 19:22.962
HE GETS DISORIENTED.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.497
I PUT FURNITURE
IN FRONT OF THE DOOR.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.533
- WHAT DOES
THE DOCTOR SAY?

19:26.566 --> 19:27.967
- HIS INTERNIST
IS A GOOD OLD BOY.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.439
JAKE CALLS HIM "BIG GUY"
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW HIS NAME.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.706
SIGNS A FEW FOOTBALLS.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.975
- SO AS LONG
AS HE'S PLAYING A PART

19:36.008 --> 19:38.711
THAT HE'S FAMILIAR WITH,
HE'S OKAY.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.281
- UNLESS IT'S LATE
IN THE DAY.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.715
THEN ALL BETS
ARE OFF.

19:42.749 --> 19:46.919
- "SUNDOWNING."

19:46.953 --> 19:48.988
I TAKE IT
HE'S HAD AN M.R.I.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.224
- YEAH. INCONCLUSIVE.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.593
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.329
THERE'S NO TREATMENT.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.665
ALL THE DOCTOR SAID WAS
DON'T LET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.867
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LET HIM

20:00.900 --> 20:02.869
GO TO THE BATHROOM
BY HIMSELF.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.339
- DO YOU HAVE
HOME CARE?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.475
- WE'RE BROKE.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.278
HE HANDLED THE FINANCES
UNTIL THIS YEAR.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.314
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.484
- [sighs] WHAT ABOUT,
UH--WHAT ABOUT THE TEAM?

20:17.517 --> 20:19.486
OR THE LEAGUE?
DON'T THEY HAVE--

20:19.519 --> 20:22.255
- THE LEAGUE HAS A FUND
FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.256
- OKAY.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.558
- JAKE'S TOO PROUD.

20:28.361 --> 20:32.565
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
HAVE A LOT ON YOUR PLATE.

20:32.599 --> 20:37.337
WHO'S HELPING YOU?

20:37.370 --> 20:40.607
- MY HUSBAND'S
IN HOLDING.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.543
I CAN'T EVEN GET OUR LAWYER
TO COME DOWN AND HELP US.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.879
WE OWE HIM
SO MUCH MONEY.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.982
HE SAYS WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO USE A PUBLIC DEFENDER.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.998
[crying]

21:13.806 --> 21:16.309
- HE'S A, UH...

21:16.343 --> 21:20.780
HE'S A FRIEND.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.315
- POLISHED THAT OFF
IN A HURRY.

21:22.349 --> 21:26.453
- MM. I WAS HUNGRY.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.322
I, UH...

21:29.356 --> 21:32.959
UH, I'M SUPPOSED
TO CALL MY WIFE.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.628
- SHE'S HERE,
JAKE.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.897
- SHE'S GOT ME
ON A SHORT LEASH,

21:37.930 --> 21:41.000
AND I KNOW WHAT
SHE'S GONNA SAY.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.635
- "GET A LAWYER"?

21:42.669 --> 21:46.072
- [chuckles]
YES, MA'AM.

21:47.807 --> 21:51.010
[door slides shut]

21:51.043 --> 21:52.412
- TWICE
IN TWO DAYS.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.647
DOES STANTON
WANT TO BE PUT AWAY?

21:54.681 --> 21:56.749
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.718
- ME NEITHER.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.019
IF HE'S FAKING IT,
I MEAN,

22:00.052 --> 22:02.489
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTOR,
NOT AN ATHLETE.

22:02.522 --> 22:06.359
- GUESS JAKE STANTON
CAN STILL WORK IT.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.860
- DETECTIVES,
COUNSELOR,

22:07.894 --> 22:10.563
I'M GOING TO NEED A FEW MINUTES
WITH MY CLIENT.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.898
- STANTON?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.966
- YES, JAKE STANTON.
WHERE IS HE?

22:14.000 --> 22:16.636
- A-AM I MISSING
SOMETHING HERE?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.104
- WHAT'S THAT,
DETECTIVE?

22:18.137 --> 22:21.641
- NOT THE KIND OF GUY
I'D EXPECT YOU TO REPRESENT.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.009
- YOU MEAN
A WHITE GUY?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.577
- ARE YOU PLAYING
THE RACE CARD ALREADY?

22:24.611 --> 22:26.746
- [chuckles]
- REALLY?

22:26.779 --> 22:29.549
- THIS WAY.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.920
[knock at door]

22:33.953 --> 22:34.721
- OH, HEY.
COME ON IN.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.688
UH, MR. STANTON
AND I HAVE TALKED,

22:35.722 --> 22:38.090
AND I THINK
WE CAN STRAIGHTEN ALL THIS OUT.

22:38.124 --> 22:42.128
- LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS A LADIES' ROOM.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.932
- OKAY, BUT YOU DID SEE THAT
THERE WAS A WOMAN IN THERE.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.600
- YEAH, BUT I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION.

22:47.634 --> 22:50.069
I MEAN, THE LIGHTING WAS SO
DARK, I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.072
I TOLD YOU THAT
WHEN YOU ARRESTED ME.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.975
- ME?
- YEAH, YOU REMEMBER?

22:56.008 --> 23:00.447
- BUT YOU MEAN
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.715
- YEAH, YOU--
YOU GUYS LOOK A LOT ALIKE.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.183
YEAH.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.152
- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT
OF THINGS ARE CONFUSING, JAKE.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.654
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:07.687 --> 23:10.089
- WELL, MAYBE THINGS
THAT ONCE CAME EASILY TO YOU

23:10.122 --> 23:12.058
SEEM OVERWHELMING NOW.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.428
- NO, NO.
[sighs]

23:15.462 --> 23:17.597
NO, IT WAS
JUST A BAD NIGHT.

23:17.630 --> 23:21.200
[sighs] I NEVER WANTED
TO HURT ANYBODY.

23:21.233 --> 23:27.106
I--THAT'S NOT WHO
JAKE STANTON IS.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.880
- I'D ASK YOU TO RELEASE HIM
ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.682
BUT I'M NOT SURE
HE'D KNOW HOW TO GET HOME.

23:35.715 --> 23:36.883
- WELL,
HIS WIFE IS HERE.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.952
- YES, BUT I GATHER MR. ELLIS
IS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.187
- HE'S TIRED,
HE'S DISORIENTED.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.591
IF YOUR OFFICE REALLY FEELS,
UH, COMPELLED TO PROSECUTE THIS,

23:44.624 --> 23:46.493
I'LL MAKE SURE HE SHOWS UP
FOR ARRAIGNMENT.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.095
- HEY, SO THE COMPLAINANT
HAS CALMED DOWN.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.063
SHE'S WILLING
TO LET IT GO.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.865
- FINE,
BUT IF HE STUMBLES AGAIN,

23:52.899 --> 23:55.134
HIS BAIL WILL BE REVOKED.
- COUNSELOR,

23:55.167 --> 23:56.903
DOES THIS MEAN YOU'LL BE
REPRESENTING STANTON

23:56.936 --> 24:00.172
ON HIS RAPE CHARGE?
- WELL, I JUST MET HIM.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.240
BUT IF I DO
TAKE THE CASE,

24:01.273 --> 24:02.809
I SUGGEST YOU BRUSH UP
ON YOUR LATIN.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.878
- CAN'T WAIT.
- GOOD, THEN LET'S START NOW.

24:05.912 --> 24:10.817
ACTUS NON FACIT REUM
NISI MENS SIT REA.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.084
[door shuts]

24:12.118 --> 24:14.687
- "THE ACT DOES NOT MAKE
A PERSON GUILTY

24:14.721 --> 24:16.055
UNLESS THE MIND
IS ALSO GUILTY."

24:16.088 --> 24:18.124
- THANKS.
I KNEW THAT ONE.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.064
- [sighs] LOOK AT ELLIS,
PRETENDING TO CARE.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.733
AND THIS GUY--

24:26.766 --> 24:29.101
IT'S ALL P.R.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.070
HE'S A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.872
[scoffs]

24:36.208 --> 24:38.244
[inaudible]

24:47.086 --> 24:48.621
- HYPOTHETICALLY, IF YOU TOLD
A SUSPECT'S WIFE TO CALL ME--

24:48.655 --> 24:50.690
- HYPOTHETICALLY.
- I WOULD ASK,

24:50.723 --> 24:52.058
"WHY RISK LOSING
YOUR BADGE

24:52.091 --> 24:54.093
FOR A MAN YOU'D JUST ARRESTED
FOR A TERRIBLE CRIME?"

24:54.126 --> 24:56.295
- YOU'VE TALKED
TO HIM.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.965
AM I WRONG?

24:58.998 --> 25:02.034
- NO.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.836
I WATCHED MY FATHER
DIE OF PARKINSON'S.

25:03.870 --> 25:07.707
I KNOW DIMINISHED CAPACITY
WHEN I SEE IT.

25:07.740 --> 25:11.043
- THIS ONE IS ON ME.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.312
I PUSHED TO HAVE
THE GIRL'S JOHNS INDICTED,

25:13.345 --> 25:15.548
AND NOW I'M NOT SURE
THAT JAKE CAN BE HELD

25:15.582 --> 25:17.283
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HIS ACTIONS.

25:17.316 --> 25:19.786
- I'M PRETTY SURE
HE HAD NO IDEA OF HER AGE,

25:19.819 --> 25:23.255
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NO DEFENSE.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.892
- YOU'LL THINK
OF SOMETHING.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.933
- DOES THAT SOUND GOOD,
JAKE?

25:33.966 --> 25:36.135
- I'M THE QUARTERBACK.
HE'S THE COACH.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.870
YOU CALL THE PLAY,
I'LL RUN IT.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.706
- OKAY, GOOD.

25:39.739 --> 25:43.175
SO, UM,
BACK TO VICKI HARRIS.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.176
- WHO?

25:44.210 --> 25:49.248
- THE UNDERAGE PROSTITUTE.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.983
- SO THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT?

25:51.017 --> 25:51.851
- HONEY,
REMEMBER?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.220
AND MR. ELLIS
IS GOING TO DEFEND YOU.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.055
HE'S A VERY GOOD--
- NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.090
HOLD ON A SECOND, HONEY.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.192
HOW MUCH
IS THIS GONNA COST?

26:00.226 --> 26:02.929
- MR. ELLIS HAS AGREED
TO HELP US.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.063
- WELL...
[scoffs]

26:04.096 --> 26:06.232
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.134
I DON'T WANT
YOUR CHARITY.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.602
- NO, JAKE, JAKE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

26:09.636 --> 26:12.004
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.140
UH, MY SECRETARY
IS A BIG FAN...

26:14.173 --> 26:15.708
SINCE YOU WERE
ALL-AMERICAN AT PURDUE.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.877
IT WOULD MEAN
A LOT TO HER

26:17.910 --> 26:19.712
IF YOU SIGNED SOMETHING
FOR HER BOY.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.848
HOW ABOUT THAT?

26:26.385 --> 26:28.688
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.989
YOU LET ME THROW
IN A SIGNED FOOTBALL,

26:30.022 --> 26:32.124
AND YOU GOT A DEAL.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.160
- [laughs]

26:34.193 --> 26:35.361
- ALL RIGHT.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.096
- WAIT--
WAIT A MINUTE.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.631
ZARA'S READING?

26:38.665 --> 26:41.000
- WELL,
SHE'S SOUNDING OUT WORDS.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.669
- OH, OKAY.
[chuckles]

26:42.702 --> 26:43.903
- MY MOM'S
TEACHING HER.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.372
YOU KNOW, THEY--
THEY'RE GETTING ALONG GREAT.

26:46.405 --> 26:49.108
- THAT'S GREAT.

26:49.141 --> 26:53.079
SO, UM,
HOW'S JASON HOLDING UP?

26:57.116 --> 27:00.119
- UH, IT'S--
IT'S TOUGH.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.054
HE TOLD ME
LAST NIGHT,

27:02.088 --> 27:03.923
VICKI'S NOT
HIS LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

27:03.956 --> 27:08.227
I THINK HE STAYED AWAY
TOO LONG.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.033
HE'S, UH, HE'S TRYING
TO BE THERE FOR HER NOW.

27:14.066 --> 27:18.905
HE'S PLANNING ON COMING
TO THE TRIAL EVERY DAY.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.707
- WELL, HE'S A GOOD DAD.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.208
I'M GLAD
YOU COULD HELP HIM OUT.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.410
THAT MEANS
A LOT TO ME.

27:27.046 --> 27:30.116
- YOU KNOW,
I NEVER HEARD OF THIS GUY

27:30.149 --> 27:35.454
TILL HE SHOWED UP
IN THE SQUAD ROOM--

27:35.487 --> 27:38.124
- I HATE WHEN YOU DO THIS.
- WHAT'S THAT?

27:38.157 --> 27:40.727
- I THINK WE'RE HAVING
A CONVERSATION.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.329
TURNS OUT,
YOU'RE INTERROGATING ME.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.303
- HOW'S HE DOING?

27:51.337 --> 27:53.372
- LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S FINE.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.742
- HE REMEMBERS
HOW WE'RE GONNA PLAY IT?

27:55.775 --> 27:57.877
- YES.
- AND YOU UNDERSTAND

27:57.910 --> 28:00.747
AFTER WE MAKE THIS PLEA,
JAKE'S CONDITION WILL BE PUBLIC.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.949
- YES.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.351
KEEPING ALL OF THIS
A SECRET...

28:05.384 --> 28:06.418
IT HASN'T HELPED.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.091
- YOU HAVE A PRETRIAL MOTION,
MR. ELLIS?

28:12.124 --> 28:13.225
- UH, YES, YOUR HONOR.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.227
WE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE
THE STATUS OF MR. STANTON'S PLEA

28:15.261 --> 28:18.497
FROM "NOT GUILTY" TO "NOT GUILTY
BY REASON OF INSANITY."

28:18.530 --> 28:19.999
- YOUR HONOR,
AN INSANITY DEFENSE

28:20.032 --> 28:21.400
IS NOT APPROPRIATE
IN THIS CASE.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.402
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
MR. STANTON IS MENTALLY ILL.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.005
- THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HE'S
NEUROLOGICALLY ILL, YOUR HONOR.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.506
HE'S SUFFERING
FROM DIMINISHED CAPACITY.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.875
- THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN DIMINISHED CAPACITY

28:28.908 --> 28:29.942
AND CRAZY.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.011
- NOW, JUST--
JUST HOLD ON A MINUTE.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.781
- JAKE, IT'S OKAY.
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.515
- IS THERE A PROBLEM,
MR. ELLIS?

28:36.548 --> 28:37.884
- WELL, SHE JUST SAID
"NOT GUILTY"

28:37.917 --> 28:39.852
BECAUSE I WAS CRAZY.
I'M NOT CRAZY.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.020
- JAKE, I'M THE COACH HERE,
REMEMBER THAT.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.154
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ME,
ALL RIGHT?

28:42.188 --> 28:45.091
I'M NOT INSANE.
I WAS AN ALL-AMERICAN.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.325
- ALL RIGHT, JAKE.
- WHERE'S MY WIFE?

28:46.358 --> 28:47.960
- ENOUGH.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.495
- LET ME JUST TALK TO MY WIFE,
ALL RIGHT? GEORGIA?

28:49.528 --> 28:51.764
GEORGIA?
- ENOUGH.

28:51.798 --> 28:55.167
COUNSELORS,
IN MY CHAMBERS NOW.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.474
- I WAS
AN ALL-AMERICAN.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.077
- THIS IS GOING TO OPEN
A PANDORA'S BOX.

29:05.111 --> 29:08.114
EVERY DEFENDANT WILL PLEAD "NOT
GUILTY BY REASON OF CONCUSSION."

29:08.147 --> 29:10.082
- MR. ELLIS,
IS THAT YOUR GAME PLAN?

29:10.116 --> 29:12.318
- I'M DEFENDING MY CLIENT,
YOUR HONOR.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.585
WE'VE REACHED
A RUBICON.

29:13.619 --> 29:17.056
HUMAN BEHAVIOR CAN NO LONGER BE
SEPARATED FROM HUMAN BIOLOGY.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.458
THE D.A.'S OFFICE HASN'T CAUGHT
UP WITH MODERN BRAIN SCIENCE.

29:19.491 --> 29:22.394
- DON'T PREACH TO ME, MR. ELLIS.
PREACH TO YOUR CLIENT.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.063
IT'S HIS PLEA.

29:26.165 --> 29:29.836
- I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO HE WAS.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.004
- THAT'S GOOD, VICKI.
JUST LIKE THAT.

29:32.038 --> 29:35.107
JUST TELL THE TRUTH.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.176
STAY CALM.

29:37.209 --> 29:40.980
- OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.983
CAN WE GO NOW?
- YEAH.

29:44.016 --> 29:47.186
[sighs]

29:47.219 --> 29:49.021
- I HEARD
THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH LAWYER

29:49.055 --> 29:51.323
TRIED TO CLAIM
STANTON WAS INSANE.

29:51.357 --> 29:55.161
- YEAH, BUT EVEN JAKE
DIDN'T GO FOR THAT.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.929
YOU'RE GONNA DO
GREAT.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.198
I'LL BE SITTING
RIGHT THERE.

30:10.009 --> 30:13.980
- AND DO YOU SEE THAT MAN
IN THE COURTROOM TODAY?

30:14.013 --> 30:16.115
- MISS HARRIS,
YOU NEED TO ANSWER OUT LOUD.

30:16.148 --> 30:20.452
- [sighs]
YES. HE'S RIGHT THERE.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.621
- LET THE RECORD REFLECT
THE WITNESS HAS IDENTIFIED

30:22.654 --> 30:24.891
JAKE STANTON.

30:24.924 --> 30:25.992
VICKI,
HOW OLD WERE YOU

30:26.025 --> 30:29.128
WHEN MR. STANTON
HAD SEX WITH YOU?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.998
- 14.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.833
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.276
- MISS HARRIS,
FIRST OF ALL,

30:44.310 --> 30:48.014
WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR WHAT
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH.

30:48.047 --> 30:51.083
NOW, ABOUT MR. STANTON...

30:51.117 --> 30:53.119
DID HE EVER ASK YOU
HOW OLD YOU WERE?

30:53.152 --> 30:55.054
- OBJECTION.
- SUSTAINED.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.589
- DID YOU EVER TELL MR. STANTON
HOW OLD YOU WERE?

30:57.623 --> 31:00.192
- OBJECTION.
- SUSTAINED.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.895
- DID HE EVER
HURT YOU?

31:02.929 --> 31:07.166
OR FORCE YOU
IN ANY WAY?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.035
- [sighs] NO.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.203
- DID HE PAY YOU?

31:11.237 --> 31:13.439
- YES.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.910
- MIGHTN'T HE HAVE THOUGHT THIS
WAS A CONSENSUAL TRANSACTION?

31:17.944 --> 31:20.212
- OBJECTION.
- MR. ELLIS...

31:20.246 --> 31:23.215
FIND ANOTHER WAY.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.932
- IN CASES OF C.T.E.,
THERE IS OFTEN DAMAGE

31:39.966 --> 31:41.233
TO THE FRONTAL LOBE.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.534
THAT'S THE PART
OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE

31:42.568 --> 31:45.171
FOR IMPULSE CONTROL
AND DECISION-MAKING.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.706
- SO, DR. SOPHER, LET US ASSUME
THAT JAKE STANTON HAS C.T.E.,

31:47.739 --> 31:49.041
THIS DEMENTIA
YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.376
- OBJECTION.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.544
HE CANNOT ASK THE JURY
TO ASSUME WHAT IS NOT PROVEN.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.114
- SUSTAINED.
CAREFUL, COUNSELOR.

31:55.147 --> 31:59.085
- A PERSON
WITH THIS DISEASE--

31:59.118 --> 32:02.388
CAN THEY BE HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEIR ACTIONS?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.356
- IN ADVANCED STAGES
OF THE DISEASE,

32:04.390 --> 32:05.992
IN CASES I'VE SEEN,

32:06.025 --> 32:09.695
THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER THEIR OWN ACTIONS.

32:09.728 --> 32:13.265
- THANK YOU.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.600
YOUR WITNESS.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.172
- THIS C.T.E.--
IT SOUNDS SERIOUS.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.274
ARE YOU TESTIFYING THAT
JAKE STANTON SUFFERS FROM IT?

32:22.308 --> 32:25.744
- MR. STANTON'S SYMPTOMS ARE
CONSISTENT WITH THE DISEASE.

32:25.777 --> 32:29.481
- DOES HE HAVE DEMENTIA,
DOCTOR?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.117
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:31.150 --> 32:34.253
THE ONLY WAY TO DIAGNOSE C.T.E.
IS IN AN AUTOPSY,

32:34.286 --> 32:36.388
BY EXAMINING
THE BRAIN.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.424
- SO THERE'S NO WAY
TO DIAGNOSE C.T.E.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.159
WHILE THE PATIENT
IS STILL ALIVE?

32:40.192 --> 32:42.194
- THAT'S CORRECT.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.263
- THEREFORE ANY SUGGESTION
THAT JAKE STANTON

32:44.296 --> 32:46.532
SUFFERS FROM C.T.E.
IS PURE SPECULATION.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.168
- YES.

32:49.201 --> 32:52.038
- I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS 14,
AND I DIDN'T RAPE ANYBODY.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.739
- UNDER THE LAW,
YOU DID.

32:53.772 --> 32:54.806
- IS THERE A QUESTION,
YOUR HONOR?

32:54.840 --> 32:58.044
- ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU HAD SEX
WITH MISS HARRIS,

32:58.077 --> 33:00.179
AND YOU SOLICITED SEX
FROM OFFICER LEGRANGE?

33:00.212 --> 33:02.081
- YES, I DID.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.116
BUT OTHER GUYS
CHEAT ON THEIR WIVES.

33:04.150 --> 33:07.053
THEY WINE AND DINE THESE WOMEN
AND TAKE THEM TO FANCY HOTELS.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.287
YOU DON'T SEE ME
DOING THAT.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.222
- OH, OKAY.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.624
SO YOU DO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.060
- OBJECTION.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.494
- ISN'T IT TRUE
THAT YOU MADE THE ARRANGEMENTS

33:15.527 --> 33:18.130
BY YOURSELF,
YOU TOOK CABS TO THE HOTELS,

33:18.164 --> 33:20.099
YOU FOUND THEIR ROOMS,
AND YOU BROUGHT

33:20.132 --> 33:22.034
THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF CASH?
- [chuckles] EXACTLY.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.204
IT'S NOT LIKE--
IT'S NOT LIKE I PICKED HER UP

33:25.237 --> 33:26.405
OFF A PLAYGROUND AND SAID,
"HEY, KID,

33:26.438 --> 33:28.174
DO YOU WANT SOME CANDY?"

33:28.207 --> 33:29.808
I'M NOT A CHILD MOLESTER.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.044
I THOUGHT
THEY WERE WORKING GIRLS.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.546
- YOUR HONOR, I NEED A MOMENT
TO CONFER WITH MY CLIENT.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.682
- TEN MINUTES,
MR. ELLIS.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.350
- I TOLD YOU, I TOLD YOU.
I'M NOT CRAZY.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.086
- YEAH, I-I KNOW, JAKE,
BUT DO YOU REMEMBER

33:40.119 --> 33:42.288
WHEN WE TOLD YOU TO ANSWER
THE QUESTIONS, "YES" AND "NO"?

33:42.321 --> 33:43.789
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'RE THE COACH.

33:43.822 --> 33:45.357
BUT I'M DOING GREAT
OUT THERE.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.825
I'M MOVING THE BALL
DOWN THE FIELD.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.827
WE'RE IN THE RED ZONE NOW.
- HONEY, PLEASE.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.098
MR. ELLIS IS DOING EVERYTHING
TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY HOME.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.700
- YOU CAN'T PULL ME OUT NOW.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

33:54.733 --> 33:59.305
- IF HE GOES TO PRISON,
IT'LL KILL HIM.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.509
- I KNOW.

34:07.479 --> 34:09.281
LET'S GO GET 'EM, JAKE.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.250
OKAY, BIG GUY?

34:11.283 --> 34:13.085
LET'S GO GET 'EM.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.420
[slap]
- OKAY.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.622
- OKAY.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.490
- LET'S GO.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.460
- YOUR HONOR, THE PEOPLE REST.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.862
- ALL RIGHT.
LONG DAY, EVERYONE.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.532
WE'LL RECONVENE TOMORROW MORNING
AT 9:00 A.M.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.701
- REDIRECT, YOUR HONOR.
- EXCUSE ME?

34:29.735 --> 34:31.703
- I HAVE A FEW MORE
QUESTIONS FOR MY CLIENT.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.539
- YOUR HONOR, IT'S QUITE LATE.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.107
CAN THE REDIRECT WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING?

34:35.141 --> 34:37.409
- MY CLIENT WOULD LIKE
TO FINISH TONIGHT.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.480
- FINE, MR. ELLIS.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.649
I'LL ALLOW IT.

34:44.883 --> 34:49.255
- VICKI HARRIS?
IS THAT THE PROSTITUTE?

34:49.288 --> 34:51.123
- DO YOU REMEMBER
BEING IN HER ROOM?

34:51.157 --> 34:53.859
- WELL, IF SHE SAYS I WAS.

34:53.892 --> 34:56.595
- DID YOU ENGAGE
IN ANY SEXUAL ACTIVITY?

34:56.628 --> 35:00.199
- I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY
I'M HERE NOW.

35:00.232 --> 35:03.535
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
THREE THINGS, JAKE.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.537
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
MARRIED TO YOUR WIFE?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.439
- LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.

35:07.473 --> 35:10.542
25 YEARS.

35:10.576 --> 35:11.710
- WHO IS TERRY DRAKE?

35:11.743 --> 35:13.845
- OBJECTION.
RELEVANCE.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.614
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
MR. ELLIS?

35:15.647 --> 35:17.183
- A LITTLE LATITUDE,
YOUR HONOR.

35:17.216 --> 35:18.717
- GO ON.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.687
- TERRY DRAKE.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.256
- TERRY?

35:24.290 --> 35:26.192
TERRY'S MY CENTER.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.527
SAW HIS BACKSIDE
MORE OFTEN THAN MY WIFE'S.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.862
- SO YOU SAW THE BACK OF
HIS JERSEY QUITE A FEW TIMES.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.631
- EVERY SUNDAY
FOR 12 YEARS.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.301
- WHAT NUMBER
DID HE WEAR?

35:36.435 --> 35:39.905
- 50...

35:43.942 --> 35:45.444
52?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.480
- AND WHAT NUMBER DID YOU
WEAR AS QUARTERBACK?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.449
- 9.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.219
SOMEDAY NEW YORK IS GONNA
RETIRE THAT NUMBER,

35:53.252 --> 35:55.421
HANG IT IN THE STADIUM.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.923
YOU CAN MARK THAT DOWN,
MA'AM.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.858
- YOU WATCH FOOTBALL MUCH
THESE DAYS?

35:59.891 --> 36:01.860
- EVERY CHANCE I GET.
- DO YOU KNOW THE NAMES

36:01.893 --> 36:05.964
OF THE TWO QUARTERBACKS
FOR NEW YORK'S TEAMS?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.734
- I, UH...
I WATCH THE GAMES,

36:08.767 --> 36:10.436
BUT I DON'T REALLY
PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION.

36:10.469 --> 36:11.837
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN MARRIED?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.706
- 20 YEARS.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.609
- YOU JUST TOLD ME 25.

36:17.643 --> 36:20.412
- UH...
20, 25.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.214
A LONG TIME.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.816
- YOU EVER GET HURT
WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING FOOTBALL?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.885
- I WAS TAKEN OUTTA GAMES.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.621
CONCUSSIONS...

36:29.655 --> 36:30.856
BROKEN THIS OR THAT.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.424
THAT'S ALL PART OF
PLAYING THE POSITION.

36:32.458 --> 36:36.194
- WHAT WERE THE THREE THINGS
I JUST ASKED YOU ABOUT?

36:37.429 --> 36:39.298
- WHAT THINGS?
- I JUST ASKED YOU

36:39.331 --> 36:42.200
THREE QUESTIONS.
DO YOU REMEMBER THEM?

36:46.638 --> 36:48.974
- UM...

36:49.007 --> 36:51.677
YOU ASKED ME ABOUT MY WIFE.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.546
AND, UH...

36:54.580 --> 36:56.582
I DON'T--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE

36:56.615 --> 36:58.950
ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS.
- OBJECTION. RELEVANCE.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.386
- GET TO THE POINT,
COUNSELOR.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.522
- DID YOU HAVE SEX
WITH VICKI HARRIS?

37:03.555 --> 37:05.391
- WHO?
- THE GIRL YOU'RE ACCUSED

37:05.424 --> 37:06.692
OF RAPING.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.994
- I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T RAPE
ANYBODY!

37:09.027 --> 37:11.697
- DO YOU KNOW
WHO VICKI HARRIS IS?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.965
- I TOLD YOU,

37:13.999 --> 37:16.502
I NEVER PAID FOR SEX
WITH THAT WOMAN.

37:16.535 --> 37:20.439
- WHAT WOMAN?
- I NEVER HAD SEX WITH HER!

37:24.510 --> 37:26.945
- THAT'S NOT VICKI HARRIS, JAKE.
- I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.048
I TOLD YOU THAT.
- WHAT WAS TERRY DRAKE'S NUMBER?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.550
- CAN'T YOU MAKE HIM STOP?

37:31.583 --> 37:32.984
I'VE ANSWERED ENOUGH QUESTIONS.
- YOUR HONOR,

37:33.018 --> 37:35.421
I REQUEST A RECESS.
- I NEED TO TALK TO MY ATTORNEY.

37:35.454 --> 37:36.955
PLEASE LET ME TALK
TO MY LAWYER.

37:36.988 --> 37:40.459
- JAKE, I'M YOUR LAWYER.
- THEN WHY ARE YOU BADGERING ME?

37:40.492 --> 37:43.329
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE SAME TEAM?

37:43.362 --> 37:44.930
- DO YOU KNOW MY NAME, JAKE?

37:46.698 --> 37:49.435
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.669
I TOLD YOU!

37:50.702 --> 37:53.372
- HOW DID YOU GET DOWN HERE
TODAY, JAKE?

37:53.405 --> 37:56.074
- WHAT?
- WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IS IT?

37:56.107 --> 37:58.910
WHAT ARE THE CHARGES
THAT YOU FACE HERE TODAY?

38:13.892 --> 38:15.494
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
YOU ARE, JAKE?

38:15.527 --> 38:19.665
- PLEASE STOP.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.768
PLEASE.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.003
I'M...VERY TIRED

38:25.036 --> 38:27.673
AND I JUST...

38:27.706 --> 38:30.476
I JUST WANNA GO HOME.

38:38.784 --> 38:41.353
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.468
- WELL, THAT WAS UGLY.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.903
- ELLIS WAS JUST DOING
HIS JOB.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.906
STANTON IS NOT COMPETENT.
I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.007
- WARN ME?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.842
YOU WALKED ME RIGHT INTO IT.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.844
YOU WANTED A STING OPERATION.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.414
YOU WANTED TO PROSECUTE
ALL THE JOHNS FOR RAPE.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.582
- THE GUILTY ONES.
STANTON--

39:10.616 --> 39:12.718
- YOU DON'T GET TO
CHERRY PICK.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.687
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO,
PROSECUTE SOME OF THE JOHNS

39:15.721 --> 39:16.788
AND NOT STANTON?

39:16.822 --> 39:18.123
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
DOES THAT SEND?

39:18.156 --> 39:20.859
THAT THE D.A.'S OFFICE
GIVES SPORTS STARS A FREE PASS?

39:20.892 --> 39:23.395
YOU WANT JUSTICE FOR HER,
YOU WANT COMPASSION FOR HIM.

39:23.429 --> 39:24.963
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS, OLIVIA.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.097
THE WORLD DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.133
- ALEX--
- AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW

39:28.166 --> 39:31.637
HOW ELLIS SHOWED UP
IN YOUR SQUAD ROOM.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.878
- ON THE CHARGE OF RAPE
IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

39:39.911 --> 39:42.481
HOW DOES THE JURY
FIND THE DEFENDANT?

39:42.514 --> 39:44.683
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.685
- JAKE STANTON,
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.854
THESE PROCEEDINGS
ARE NOW CLOSED.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.690
THE STATE OF NEW YORK THANKS
THE JURY FOR ITS SERVICE.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.092
- THANKS.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.967
DID WE WIN IT, BABY?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.002
- YEAH, JAKE.
WE WON.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.038
- OH, GOOD.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.146
SO I DIDN'T DO IT?

40:18.584 --> 40:21.987
OH.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.657
I'M SORRY, GEORGIA.
UM...

40:27.859 --> 40:31.129
I'M SO SORRY.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.633
I'M SO SORRY, HONEY.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.903
I'M SO SORRY.

40:39.605 --> 40:43.675
- I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY TO VICKI'S FATHER.

40:43.709 --> 40:46.177
- NOBODY WINS HERE, NICK.

40:50.882 --> 40:53.519
- WELL, WE WERE DOWN
IN THE FOURTH QUARTER...

40:53.552 --> 40:56.755
BACKS AGAINST THE WALL.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.956
[lenses clicking]

40:57.989 --> 41:00.792
BUT...

41:00.826 --> 41:04.496
HAIL MARY AT THE VERY END
AND...

41:06.097 --> 41:09.568
JUST HAPPY TO BE HERE
CELEBRATING THE BIG WIN.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.771
- WHAT'S NEXT, JAKE?
- MR. STANTON, MR. STANTON,

41:12.804 --> 41:14.239
DO YOU HAVE DEMENTIA?
- ANY HEALTH ISSUES,

41:14.272 --> 41:15.741
MR. STANTON?
- HAVE YOU HAD

41:15.774 --> 41:18.009
AN OFFICIAL DIAGNOSES?
NOW THIS IS PUBLIC,
