00:07.854 --> 00:09.455
<i>The island of Okinawa,</i>

00:09.489 --> 00:12.357
<i>The final step of the allies'
planned invasion</i>

00:12.391 --> 00:14.259
<i>Of the Japanese mainland.</i>

00:14.293 --> 00:17.662
<i>In all of the
Pacific, there probably wasn't</i>

00:17.696 --> 00:21.831
A more terrible campaign
than Okinawa.

00:28.269 --> 00:32.104
<i>It was bloody hell.</i>

00:32.140 --> 00:34.174
They were making us pay dearly

00:34.208 --> 00:36.543
For our advances.

00:38.645 --> 00:41.546
<i>Okinawa had the highest
number of casualties</i>

00:41.581 --> 00:44.081
<i>In all the campaigns
of the Pacific.</i>

00:44.116 --> 00:47.517
<i>In addition to the American
and Japanese forces,</i>

00:47.552 --> 00:50.253
<i>Hundreds of thousands
of Okinawan civilians</i>

00:50.287 --> 00:54.124
<i>Were wounded or killed, caught
in the crossfire of battle.</i>

00:56.728 --> 00:58.761
<i>The devastation
was compounded</i>

00:58.796 --> 01:02.630
<i>By the torrential rains
that swept the island.</i>

01:02.665 --> 01:04.799
<i>The rains were so constant</i>

01:04.833 --> 01:09.169
And the mud so deep they couldn't
get the amtracs in there

01:09.203 --> 01:12.172
Without getting stuck
to get the bodies out.

01:12.206 --> 01:17.176
<i>So the bodies would just
constantly rot away.</i>

01:20.479 --> 01:23.481
<i>You wondered
just when in the hell</i>

01:23.515 --> 01:26.116
<i>Is this thing
gonna be over?</i>

01:26.150 --> 01:29.586
Here I am, been out here
for over two years

01:29.620 --> 01:31.920
And it's still going.

01:31.955 --> 01:34.690
<i>When in the world are we
gonna get out of this mess?</i>

01:34.724 --> 01:39.027
When are we gonna get back
where we can have on dry clothes

01:39.061 --> 01:41.196
For the whole day

01:41.230 --> 01:46.266
And live like human beings
again instead of like rats?

02:02.215 --> 02:04.415
Why don't they just surrender?

02:04.449 --> 02:05.783
'cause they're Japs.

02:05.817 --> 02:08.217
<i>We're gonna have to root
them out one by one.</i>

02:13.857 --> 02:16.758
<i>They're everywhere!</i>

02:16.792 --> 02:19.292
The Japs are everywhere.

02:22.061 --> 02:24.828
<i>The worst thing about
treating those combat boys</i>

02:24.862 --> 02:28.731
From the great war wasn't that
they had had their flesh torn.

02:28.765 --> 02:32.001
<i>It was that they had
had their souls torn out.</i>

02:34.504 --> 02:36.505
What you doing, sledgehammer?

02:36.539 --> 02:38.072
Thought I'd bag me
some Jap gold.

02:38.107 --> 02:40.273
- You don't want to do that.
- Why not?

02:41.275 --> 02:43.142
I saw you do it.

02:43.176 --> 02:46.344
Don't!
You shouldn't do it.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.083
I could settle for something
to eat right now.

06:14.118 --> 06:15.885
This looks like fucking poo.

06:15.919 --> 06:18.087
Always replacing the army.

06:18.121 --> 06:21.723
Smitty, Burke, let's go! Move!

06:23.559 --> 06:26.293
- Son of a bit.
- Let's go!

07:03.593 --> 07:05.263
Are those Jap prisoners?

07:05.297 --> 07:08.132
- No. - On account of we
don't take prisoners.

07:11.202 --> 07:13.570
Hey, take it easy.

07:13.604 --> 07:16.506
<i>That's outgoing.</i>

07:16.540 --> 07:19.709
- They're Okinawans.
- They look like Japs.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.910
Shut the fuck up, Kathy.

07:21.944 --> 07:23.845
Don't you hear good?

07:23.879 --> 07:26.247
- They're Okinawites.
- Fuck off.

07:28.183 --> 07:31.685
- What you say, boot?
- The name's Peck-- Tony Peck.

07:31.719 --> 07:36.155
Hey, Pecker, let me see that photo
of your wife Kathy again.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.925
- She's gorgeous.
- Thanks.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.927
I need something
to jerk-off to.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.597
She's perfect.
"Oh, Kathy.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.566
Oh, Kathy.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.769
"Harder. Harder!"

08:00.679 --> 08:04.781
- Shit. - The new ponchos
are full of chemicals.

08:06.650 --> 08:09.319
- Chemicals, huh?
- What chemicals?

08:09.353 --> 08:11.321
They done treat 'em with
all kinds of chemicals.

08:11.355 --> 08:14.824
That shit'll make you
sick-- real real sick.

08:14.859 --> 08:17.727
- I didn't hear that.
- Yeah, you think they're gonna tell you?

08:19.663 --> 08:21.798
Here, take mine.

08:21.832 --> 08:24.167
Okay, thanks.

08:30.607 --> 08:32.508
<i>Semper fi.</i>

08:38.648 --> 08:40.982
Well, look what we've got here.

08:41.015 --> 08:42.817
I thought you didn't
take prisoners.

08:42.851 --> 08:45.253
Those are army prisoners, boot.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.728
You fucking monkeys.

08:56.998 --> 08:59.400
Dirty little nips.

09:04.305 --> 09:06.773
<i>Out of the
way, Hirohito.</i>

09:09.909 --> 09:13.010
Move, you slant-eyed
bastard. Move!

09:13.044 --> 09:15.679
<i>- Shoot him!
- Sit down.</i>

09:15.713 --> 09:17.780
- Move!
- Sit down!

09:17.814 --> 09:21.250
Do it! Fucking do it!

09:21.285 --> 09:23.085
- Do it!
- Fucking shoot him!

09:27.257 --> 09:28.958
- Move!
- Sit the fuck down!

09:28.992 --> 09:33.228
- Sit the fuck down!
- You can't mistreat these men.

09:33.263 --> 09:35.464
They're protected
by the Geneva conventions.

09:35.498 --> 09:37.733
<i>Fuck the Geneva code!
Hey hey!</i>

09:37.767 --> 09:40.603
- What's the hold up?
- These men attacked my prisoners.

09:40.637 --> 09:42.438
I want his rank
and serial number!

09:42.472 --> 09:44.707
- Get your hands off of him.
- Oh, come on!

09:46.309 --> 09:48.376
I command these men.
I'll take care of them.

09:48.410 --> 09:50.643
Do you speak Japanese?

09:50.677 --> 09:52.310
I'm an intelligence officer.

09:52.345 --> 09:55.546
Right. Well, maybe you should
use your fucking intelligence

09:55.580 --> 09:57.013
And get these people
off the trail.

10:01.615 --> 10:04.882
You hit another Japanese prisoner,
I'll have you court-martialed.

10:14.821 --> 10:16.955
<i>Cover!
Head for cover!</i>

10:19.793 --> 10:22.027
Come on, let's go!

10:25.332 --> 10:27.033
Look out for the leg!

10:27.067 --> 10:28.634
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

10:28.669 --> 10:31.070
Get that radio set up!

10:31.105 --> 10:33.005
Right now!
In here!

10:33.040 --> 10:36.375
Let's go! Mortars over here!
Let's go go!

10:37.244 --> 10:39.345
Stay down!
Stay down!

10:39.379 --> 10:42.949
- Get that gun set up!
- You're the officer relieving us?

10:42.983 --> 10:44.417
I'm the C.O.
Of k company,

10:44.451 --> 10:46.519
- 3rd battalion, 5th marines!
- Stay down!

10:46.553 --> 10:49.454
We couldn't hold 'em!
The Japs are dug in deep!

10:49.489 --> 10:51.456
<i>We lost a lot
of good men out there!</i>

10:51.491 --> 10:54.925
- Where's the rest of your company?
- This is it!

10:54.960 --> 10:56.694
You're gonna need
more than that!

10:56.728 --> 10:58.863
<i>Like I
said, this is it!</i>

10:58.897 --> 11:00.398
All right, Mac,
get them up the hill!

11:00.432 --> 11:03.235
Go! Let's go!
Let's go! Go!

11:03.269 --> 11:06.138
<i>Move move!</i>

11:06.173 --> 11:08.841
Let's go, people!
Move it up there!

11:08.875 --> 11:11.777
<i>Move out! Move it!</i>

11:11.811 --> 11:15.379
- Move it along!
- Get up the hill! Move it!

11:17.215 --> 11:19.316
<i>Let's go!
Get up there!</i>

11:19.350 --> 11:22.586
<i>Everybody up!
Keep moving!</i>

11:23.954 --> 11:25.387
First and second squad!

11:25.422 --> 11:28.424
Second squad here!
Hamm! Hamm!

11:28.458 --> 11:31.292
<i>- Hamm, over here!
- Come on!</i>

11:31.327 --> 11:33.294
<i>Stay with me!
Get down!</i>

11:33.328 --> 11:35.596
Set up the mortar
base plate too!

11:35.630 --> 11:39.165
First squad--
first squad here!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.534
Stay the fuck down!

11:41.568 --> 11:44.069
- Hanging.
- Fire!

11:47.840 --> 11:51.108
<i>- Come on, move!
- Shit. Let's go.</i>

11:51.142 --> 11:53.376
Lock it in there.
Make sure this is straight.

11:53.411 --> 11:55.545
<i>- Hurry the fuck up!
- Come on, boys. Come on.</i>

11:55.579 --> 11:57.980
We're not on level
ground yet. Come on.

11:58.014 --> 12:00.082
- Hanging.
- Fire!

12:15.126 --> 12:17.827
You're gonna drown in that hole
without a trench for the runoff.

12:17.861 --> 12:19.762
Huh?

12:22.264 --> 12:25.766
Put a small hole at the bottom.
It helps with the drainage.

12:28.670 --> 12:31.704
Don't know why you bother.
They'll be dead in a few days.

12:31.739 --> 12:33.840
Don't want to know their names.

12:33.874 --> 12:38.109
My name is Hamm--
h-a, two Ms.

12:38.143 --> 12:40.611
Just use it
to get my attention.

12:40.645 --> 12:43.146
Hamm with two Ms.

12:44.448 --> 12:46.749
Now I've got
to forget something.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.018
I need some long thin ones.

12:50.052 --> 12:53.854
- Try this.
- I've got one.

12:56.091 --> 12:59.325
Hey, Kathy. Give me those ready rounds.
Break out some more.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.665
Holy hell.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.267
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

13:49.302 --> 13:52.203
<i>What the fuck
is that stench?!</i>

13:52.238 --> 13:54.573
<i>Shit.</i>

13:54.608 --> 13:57.210
Unbelievable.

13:57.245 --> 13:59.180
Start digging.

13:59.215 --> 14:03.685
<i>- Fucking horseshit.
- Oh, man.</i>

14:05.088 --> 14:07.090
What are you doing, private?

14:07.125 --> 14:10.261
Holes are supposed
to be five yards apart.

14:10.295 --> 14:12.730
Sir, there's a dead body
in there.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.131
The whole island's a graveyard.

14:15.165 --> 14:18.032
Get in your hole
and start digging.

14:21.770 --> 14:24.704
<i>Send him down
another 15 yards!</i>

14:33.344 --> 14:36.679
How come the Japs are buried
and our guys aren't?

14:41.716 --> 14:43.984
Fire mission 16!
Fire mission!

14:44.018 --> 14:47.152
<i>- Fire mission!
- Gun one, fire!</i>

14:48.620 --> 14:52.087
<i>Gun three, fire h.E.
For effect on the pre-plots!</i>

14:52.121 --> 14:53.787
Hanging!

14:54.821 --> 14:57.356
<i>Fire!</i>

14:58.524 --> 15:00.525
- Short round!
- Short round!

15:00.559 --> 15:02.493
Short round!
Short round!

15:02.527 --> 15:04.294
Shit.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.330
Let's go. Try again.

15:08.966 --> 15:10.700
Hanging.

15:13.003 --> 15:16.505
- Fuck!
- Misfire!

15:16.539 --> 15:18.140
Misfire!

15:18.174 --> 15:21.009
- It's hot.
- Clear it.

15:23.546 --> 15:25.447
Easy.

15:25.481 --> 15:28.316
Got it.

15:36.790 --> 15:39.291
<i>- Check the water!
- Try again?</i>

15:39.326 --> 15:41.660
No, our fucking rounds
are all wet.

15:45.063 --> 15:48.699
Keep firing, God damn it!
Pour it on!

15:48.733 --> 15:51.235
Our rounds are wet!

15:51.269 --> 15:54.137
Get more then!
There's ammo up the road!

15:54.171 --> 15:56.339
<i>- Go!
- Hanging!</i>

15:56.373 --> 15:59.275
<i>- Fire!
- Let's go.</i>

16:01.711 --> 16:03.646
Dice, Hamm, with me.

16:04.715 --> 16:07.350
You stay here!

16:10.954 --> 16:13.689
<i>Open up!
Up the rate of fire!</i>

16:13.723 --> 16:15.691
<i>Let's go!</i>

16:26.067 --> 16:27.833
Let's go.

16:32.004 --> 16:34.972
- What do you need?
- We need 60 mortars-- h.E.

16:41.413 --> 16:43.280
Friendlies coming in!

16:43.314 --> 16:46.048
<i>Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!</i>

17:09.670 --> 17:12.305
- Hey! That kid's still alive!
- Get down.

17:12.339 --> 17:15.509
- Get down.
- That kid's still alive!

17:30.755 --> 17:33.690
<i>- Covering fire!
- Let's go.</i>

17:42.464 --> 17:46.367
<i>He's dead.
Keep moving.</i>

17:55.011 --> 17:57.912
<i>Hanging!
Fire!</i>

17:57.946 --> 17:59.980
<i>- Hanging two!
- Fire!</i>

18:00.014 --> 18:04.217
<i>- Hanging three!
- Fire!</i>

18:45.282 --> 18:48.150
Why aren't we
giving them safe passage?

18:48.184 --> 18:49.950
What are you talking about?

18:49.984 --> 18:51.883
The civilians.

18:53.352 --> 18:56.817
We should be
giving them safe conduct.

18:56.852 --> 18:59.117
A lot of them are
helping the nips, Hamm.

19:00.285 --> 19:02.385
That family wasn't.

19:03.784 --> 19:06.786
Only thing that Matts
up here is killing Japs.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.055
<i>Get this gear, Gavanoff.</i>

19:17.092 --> 19:19.723
You know, the first time
you see someone get killed--

19:22.124 --> 19:24.457
It's something.

19:24.492 --> 19:26.724
You get used to it.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.292
I was 15.

19:31.727 --> 19:34.792
A buddy and I were hopping
subway cars in Brooklyn.

19:34.826 --> 19:36.991
We went through a tunnel that
was a little bit too small.

19:37.026 --> 19:39.324
I fractured my skull.
He, uh--

19:39.358 --> 19:41.090
His brains and bones got spread

19:41.125 --> 19:42.956
All over my face and chest.

19:44.957 --> 19:47.390
You never ever forget
something like that.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.324
Good thing your damn head
is so fucking hard.

19:51.359 --> 19:54.223
You've got nine lives,
bill Leyden.

19:57.991 --> 20:00.988
What's the matter, Kathy?

20:01.023 --> 20:03.920
One day of combat,
you're all wore out.

20:06.852 --> 20:09.452
More excitement's
on the way, princess.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.985
Japs are fighting
for their own turf now.

20:13.019 --> 20:16.051
Every damn foot we go South

20:16.085 --> 20:19.451
They'll get meaner and meaner.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.154
<i>You'd better
get mean too, boot.</i>

20:31.895 --> 20:33.661
Ooh.

20:33.695 --> 20:36.063
Ooh, la la la.

20:36.097 --> 20:38.598
Now that's a piece of ass.

20:38.633 --> 20:40.800
Careful. That's the man's
wife you're talking about.

20:41.702 --> 20:43.402
<i>Mmm.</i>

20:46.539 --> 20:48.473
Wow.

20:48.507 --> 20:50.374
- Yeah.
- I'd marry her.

20:50.408 --> 20:52.609
Marry?

20:52.644 --> 20:55.078
Who said anything
about marriage?

20:55.112 --> 20:56.707
Her back.

20:56.742 --> 20:58.638
"Kathy Jones"?

20:58.665 --> 21:03.650
Thought you said name was Peck.

21:05.662 --> 21:07.255
She's not--
she's not your wife.

21:07.289 --> 21:10.912
Oh, that's rich.

21:10.946 --> 21:14.338
What's the missus think
about Kitty cat?

21:14.373 --> 21:16.864
I met her after I was drafted.

21:16.899 --> 21:19.624
- What?
- Drafted?

21:20.823 --> 21:23.649
What kind of marine is drafted?

21:25.645 --> 21:27.874
Hamm, were you drafted too?

21:27.908 --> 21:29.472
No.

21:29.503 --> 21:31.664
I don't believe it.

21:31.699 --> 21:35.425
No way that broad is
banging some drafted marine.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.421
- No way.
- I don't care what you think.

21:50.228 --> 21:52.586
They're leaving.
Japs are retreating.

21:52.621 --> 21:55.479
They're leaving.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.941
K company, let's move!
Let's move!

21:57.976 --> 22:00.767
Burgin, 2nd battalion's
broken through on the left.

22:00.801 --> 22:02.462
We need to guard their flank.

22:02.496 --> 22:04.424
Third platoon in reserve!

22:04.458 --> 22:06.920
First and second,
form a skirmish line.

22:06.954 --> 22:08.781
<i>- Burgin...
- First platoon, hold tight!</i>

22:08.815 --> 22:10.809
...I need all the men
you can spare.

22:10.844 --> 22:13.138
<i>Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!</i>

22:13.172 --> 22:15.396
The Japs are falling back!
Let's go!

22:16.130 --> 22:18.691
- Second squad, let's go.
- Why us?

22:18.726 --> 22:20.587
Because your squad's
low on ammo.

22:20.621 --> 22:22.182
<i>Move it!
Get on that hill!</i>

22:22.216 --> 22:24.044
If it makes any damn difference
to you, I'm coming with you.

22:24.078 --> 22:25.609
So grab a rifle and move.

22:25.643 --> 22:28.568
<i>- Shit.
- Second squad, let's go.</i>

22:28.602 --> 22:30.430
<i>- On me!
- Fuck.</i>

22:30.464 --> 22:33.824
<i>- We're moving up.
- We're taking some ground!</i>

22:33.858 --> 22:37.482
Great. 'cause of you, we're
gonna get our asses shot up.

22:42.338 --> 22:45.299
<i>Extend the left!
Extend the left!</i>

22:45.333 --> 22:48.027
It's about time you
stateside boys got to see

22:48.061 --> 22:49.693
- What the war's all about.
- Not now, bill.

22:49.728 --> 22:52.356
<i>We need more
damn men up here.</i>

22:54.154 --> 22:56.317
<i>All right!
Let's go! Move out!</i>

22:56.351 --> 22:58.648
Oh lord.
Okay okay.

22:58.682 --> 23:00.004
<i>Okay okay.
Stay on line!</i>

23:05.038 --> 23:07.030
Spread out!
Break to the left!

23:08.965 --> 23:11.526
Get on line!

23:11.856 --> 23:13.851
Make sure to check everything!

23:13.885 --> 23:16.048
<i>Get help right there!</i>

23:16.082 --> 23:18.944
<i>Move slow in the center!</i>

23:18.979 --> 23:20.975
<i>Check everything!</i>

23:29.263 --> 23:31.659
Stay as low as you can.
Follow my lead.

23:31.693 --> 23:33.887
Keep your intervals.

23:49.268 --> 23:52.097
<i>First platoon,
get up on the rocks!</i>

23:52.132 --> 23:55.227
<i>Sniper!</i>

24:00.122 --> 24:02.553
<i>Put some
fire on that crew!</i>

24:02.587 --> 24:06.015
<i>- Move it!
- Let's go.</i>

24:06.049 --> 24:07.646
<i>Tell them
to try to hold it!</i>

24:07.680 --> 24:09.977
Wait for word!

24:18.300 --> 24:20.263
Happy to be back, bill?

24:20.297 --> 24:22.592
What the fuck are
we doing here?

24:53.887 --> 24:57.453
<i>- Civilians!
- Civilians!</i>

24:57.488 --> 24:59.361
<i>Let's go.
Move 'em through.</i>

24:59.395 --> 25:01.582
Come on, get out
of the way. Come on.

25:09.623 --> 25:11.356
Sledge, what do you see?

25:22.066 --> 25:25.101
- She's trying to give us the baby.
- What do we do?

25:33.742 --> 25:36.344
<i>- Booby-trapped!
- Oh, no.</i>

25:36.378 --> 25:39.079
<i>She's wired!</i>

25:51.287 --> 25:54.021
Take her!

26:07.136 --> 26:09.304
<i>We can't move!
Get at damn gun!</i>

26:24.587 --> 26:26.388
Stay down!

26:28.324 --> 26:30.826
<i>Incoming!
Cease fire!</i>

26:30.860 --> 26:33.495
<i>Cease fire,
God damn it!</i>

26:44.237 --> 26:47.838
- Corpsman!
- Get up here!

27:01.983 --> 27:03.783
<i>Oh lord.</i>

27:03.817 --> 27:05.818
<i>Incoming!</i>

27:05.852 --> 27:07.919
<i>- Take cover!
- Those are ours.</i>

27:09.488 --> 27:12.122
- Short round!
- Our own fuckers are shelling us.

27:12.156 --> 27:14.591
<i>Pull back!
Back to the other Ridge!</i>

27:14.625 --> 27:16.326
- Go go!
- Fall back!

27:16.360 --> 27:19.094
Fall back!
Fall back!

27:21.330 --> 27:23.664
- Son of a bitch!
- Fall back to the start point!

27:23.699 --> 27:26.366
They have us targeted!

27:31.605 --> 27:33.873
<i>Move! Move!</i>

27:33.907 --> 27:37.276
<i>- Move!
- Let's go! Go!</i>

27:37.310 --> 27:39.078
Come on!

27:44.118 --> 27:46.887
This is fucking bullshit!

27:46.921 --> 27:49.723
I ever find
the fucking f.O.

27:49.757 --> 27:51.724
That called that arty,
I'll shoot him!

27:51.758 --> 27:53.591
The sons of bitches
will just do it again.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.193
- Why did they Shell us?
- Because some asshole officer read a map wrong,

27:56.227 --> 27:58.094
And nobody gives
a shit about us.

27:58.129 --> 28:01.030
<i>There is no goddamn reason.
Got a body over here!</i>

28:01.064 --> 28:03.332
<i>Get out there
and police 'em up.</i>

28:49.671 --> 28:52.205
<i>Get me a count.</i>

28:52.239 --> 28:54.206
<i>Move those casualties back
to the collection point.</i>

28:54.240 --> 28:56.607
Ready, lift.

28:56.642 --> 28:58.609
Eugene.

29:18.462 --> 29:19.996
Eugene.

29:20.030 --> 29:23.132
<i>My dog died.</i>

29:32.107 --> 29:34.074
I'm sorry.

29:38.412 --> 29:40.613
He was a good dog.

29:45.119 --> 29:47.020
How old was he?

29:48.356 --> 29:50.590
Got him as a pup
about nine years ago,

29:50.625 --> 29:52.225
Maybe 10.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.866
They say dogs live, what,

30:03.036 --> 30:05.337
Seven years
to every one of ours?

30:22.354 --> 30:25.422
<i>Take those cleaning
rags to second squad.</i>

30:28.359 --> 30:30.660
My brother was
on the bunker hill.

30:30.694 --> 30:32.929
Wow.

30:32.963 --> 30:35.833
Ship got hit by two kamikazes.

30:35.867 --> 30:38.436
500 guys died, asshole.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.539
<i>How the fuck
can they do that?</i>

30:41.574 --> 30:44.375
Fly themselves into a ship?

30:44.410 --> 30:46.645
Emperor is God.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.981
Duty to God.

30:50.050 --> 30:52.052
They can't fucking surrender?

30:55.490 --> 30:57.457
I hope they don't.

30:59.326 --> 31:02.395
I hope we get to kill
every last one of them.

31:09.604 --> 31:12.305
- God damn it, give it back.
- Forget about her.

31:12.340 --> 31:14.673
You're fucking married, anyway.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.342
Fuck you!

31:17.878 --> 31:19.345
<i>- Stop it, bill.
- Hey, knock that shit off.</i>

31:19.379 --> 31:21.546
Bill. Bill.
God damn it, bill.

31:21.581 --> 31:23.348
Bill. Hey! Bill.

31:23.382 --> 31:26.583
What the fuck's the matter with you, bill?
The Japs ain't enough?

31:27.519 --> 31:29.719
What the fuck is this about?

31:29.753 --> 31:32.654
It's just a damn picture, Peck.
Get the fuck out of here.

31:33.689 --> 31:35.555
She sent him a letter.

31:35.590 --> 31:38.858
You know, a letter.

31:39.859 --> 31:41.893
<i>Who gives a shit?</i>

31:41.928 --> 31:44.796
<i>We don't need this crap, bill.
You think I need it?</i>

31:44.830 --> 31:46.731
We don't need it, bill.

32:00.345 --> 32:03.814
- Bill! Bill!
- Oh shit! Oh shit!

32:03.848 --> 32:05.449
- Sledge!
- Corpsman!

32:05.483 --> 32:08.485
<i>Bill!</i>

32:08.519 --> 32:11.121
<i>Corpsman,
we've got wounded!</i>

32:11.155 --> 32:15.659
- Snafu!
- Corpsman! Corpsman!

32:17.795 --> 32:20.997
- Bill! - Come on.
Come on. Come on.

32:22.099 --> 32:24.467
<i>Get him to b.A.S.!</i>

32:24.502 --> 32:27.870
Come on.

33:02.910 --> 33:06.545
Hey, why don't you get a newer
poncho off a dead body?

33:08.482 --> 33:10.616
This one suits me just fine.

33:24.031 --> 33:28.735
Man, I thought
it'd be different.

33:30.938 --> 33:33.706
Different from what?

33:33.741 --> 33:35.875
Books you read?

33:35.909 --> 33:37.510
Movies you saw?

33:37.544 --> 33:39.779
No, I just--

33:41.348 --> 33:43.449
I'm just saying.

33:46.286 --> 33:48.087
Grow up, Hamm.

33:50.523 --> 33:52.591
Fuck you, sledge.

33:54.727 --> 33:57.796
Why don't you pull yourself in
the hole the next time, okay?

33:59.665 --> 34:01.533
That's the talk.

34:01.567 --> 34:04.803
Yeah.
Fuck you too.

34:06.505 --> 34:09.341
The Hammbone did learn
something in boot camp.

34:13.346 --> 34:16.815
<i>Where you from,
Hamm with two ms?</i>

34:16.849 --> 34:19.150
So now you want to know
where they're from?

34:37.668 --> 34:40.402
Jesus, can't they
give it a rest?

34:45.237 --> 34:47.038
What's the date?

34:47.072 --> 34:50.306
June 5th maybe.
Might be the 6th.

34:50.341 --> 34:52.241
We're never getting
off this island.

34:52.275 --> 34:54.809
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

34:54.842 --> 34:56.443
You dig that any deeper,

34:56.476 --> 34:58.576
<i>They'll get you
for desertion.</i>

35:01.046 --> 35:02.846
We got here April 1st.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.781
Easter Sunday.

35:04.815 --> 35:07.884
Fucking April fools, no
matter how you look at it.

35:07.918 --> 35:10.119
That's 66 days.

35:12.723 --> 35:14.424
We're never getting
off this island.

35:15.359 --> 35:17.460
Oh, come on, Kathy.

35:17.495 --> 35:20.430
Summer's right
around the corner,

35:20.464 --> 35:22.897
Then Halloween

35:25.232 --> 35:27.666
<i>And then there's
Thanksgiving.</i>

35:27.701 --> 35:31.870
Look. I'm already working
on your Christmas present.

35:39.712 --> 35:41.813
Out of the sticks in '46.

35:41.847 --> 35:44.815
Out of the heaven in '47.

35:44.849 --> 35:46.683
The golden Gate in '48.

35:48.152 --> 35:50.086
Oh, shit.

35:53.790 --> 35:55.858
<i>Let's go!
Come on up here!</i>

35:55.892 --> 35:59.161
I need a stovepipe boy up top.

35:59.195 --> 36:01.595
<i>Sledge, that's you.</i>

36:01.629 --> 36:03.630
Bring some comm wire.

36:04.632 --> 36:06.499
Yes, sir.

36:12.939 --> 36:15.341
Hamm, get a spool.

36:21.248 --> 36:23.115
Fuck!

36:40.200 --> 36:42.634
<i>Sledge,
where the fuck are you?!</i>

36:42.669 --> 36:45.604
<i>- Get your ass up here!
- Yes, sir!</i>

36:50.709 --> 36:52.911
<i>O.P. Coming in!</i>

36:55.381 --> 36:57.481
Sledge?

37:00.985 --> 37:03.885
- Here you go.
- They're moving back into that Ridge.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.820
Kutner saw Japs move
into the hut

37:06.855 --> 37:08.755
To the left of the big tomb.

37:08.790 --> 37:10.756
I want a round on it.

37:10.791 --> 37:13.091
<i>Hamm, wire in.</i>

37:26.570 --> 37:29.105
X.O. Wants a round on the
farmhouse in sector 2.

37:29.139 --> 37:31.307
Azimuth 3-1-0,
range 300.

37:31.341 --> 37:32.775
One round, h.E.

37:32.810 --> 37:36.412
<i>3-1-0. 300. One round, h.
E., on the way.</i>

37:40.117 --> 37:42.885
Left 2-0.
Add 50 and try again.

37:42.919 --> 37:45.886
<i>Left 2-0, add 50.
One round, h.E.</i>

37:51.189 --> 37:54.757
Target. Mark it concentration
Baker for this sector.

38:18.577 --> 38:22.245
Wait. Wait till
they're close.

38:49.210 --> 38:52.781
<i>Cease fire!
Cease fire!</i>

39:12.734 --> 39:14.468
Jesus, sledge.
Leave him.

39:14.502 --> 39:16.402
What for?
He's a Jap, ain't he?

39:24.011 --> 39:27.546
<i>Cease fire!
Cease fire, God damn it!</i>

39:36.622 --> 39:38.957
I told you to cease fire.
What are you doing?

39:38.991 --> 39:42.426
- Killing Japs. - You just gave
away our goddamn position.

39:42.461 --> 39:45.696
I think they've got a pretty
good idea of where we are.

39:45.730 --> 39:48.265
I told you to cease fire and
you're supposed to be observing.

39:48.299 --> 39:50.333
I see you
with a goddamn sidearm.

39:50.367 --> 39:51.901
We were all sent here
to kill Japs, weren't we?

39:51.935 --> 39:55.271
So what the hell difference does
it make what weapon we use?!

39:56.574 --> 39:59.542
I'd use my goddamn hands
if I had to.

40:28.767 --> 40:30.601
Screw it.

40:31.803 --> 40:34.071
Need some
reinforcements up here.

40:34.106 --> 40:37.041
- Give it a rest.
- Fuck you, Eugene.

40:37.075 --> 40:39.143
Yeah, fuck you too, Shelton.

40:40.445 --> 40:42.679
Fuck, I'm so fucking tired.

40:42.714 --> 40:46.383
<i>I'm fucking tired
of this maggoty stench.</i>

40:46.417 --> 40:49.152
First they order us to push forward
when we ain't got enough bodies,

40:49.186 --> 40:51.488
<i>- Then they order us to sit
in our own shit. - Shut up.</i>

40:51.522 --> 40:54.524
- They fucking Shell us with
our own artillery. - Shut up.

40:54.558 --> 40:57.794
I'm so fucking tired of not
having enough fucking bodies!

40:57.829 --> 41:00.163
- Jesus Christ! Shut up!
- Fuck you!

41:00.198 --> 41:02.399
<i>- Shut up!
- Fuck you, sledge!</i>

41:02.434 --> 41:05.203
- Shut up, Shelton!
- Fuck you!

41:05.238 --> 41:07.673
Hey, Peck!

41:07.707 --> 41:09.308
Peck, sit down!

41:10.778 --> 41:14.014
<i>- PE!
- Come on, you fuckers!</i>

41:14.049 --> 41:15.750
<i>Peck!
Come on!</i>

41:15.784 --> 41:17.886
- Peck!
- You fuckers!

41:17.920 --> 41:19.688
Come on!

41:19.723 --> 41:21.857
- Peck!
- Come and fucking get me!

41:21.891 --> 41:23.659
Come on!

41:23.693 --> 41:25.961
- Come on, you motherfuckers!
- Peck!

41:25.995 --> 41:28.330
- Peck, come on.
- Come on and get me!

41:28.364 --> 41:30.532
- Come on.
- Come on!

41:30.567 --> 41:33.001
Come on!
Come on!

41:33.035 --> 41:34.702
- Come and fucking shoot me!
- Eugene!

41:34.737 --> 41:38.039
Somebody come for me!
Come on! Come on!

41:38.073 --> 41:39.507
Hey, Peck!

41:39.541 --> 41:41.776
Peck!

41:44.882 --> 41:47.353
Stay down!

42:06.741 --> 42:10.210
You stupid bastard.
You stupid--

42:10.244 --> 42:13.113
you stupid
stupid stupid bastard!

42:13.147 --> 42:14.681
You fucking idiot!

42:14.715 --> 42:17.819
You stupid stupid bastard!

42:24.326 --> 42:27.729
Peck.
You're okay, Peck.

42:29.465 --> 42:30.932
<i>You're okay.
Hey.</i>

42:30.966 --> 42:33.934
What the fuck happened?

42:33.969 --> 42:36.537
Hamm's dead...

42:38.440 --> 42:40.341
And Peck's gone.

42:41.810 --> 42:44.680
- You two, get him out of here.
- Aye, sir.

42:47.684 --> 42:50.252
Get some shut-eye, both of you.

43:28.692 --> 43:31.193
<i>Down the hill!</i>

43:31.228 --> 43:33.095
<i>Bring up the rear!</i>

43:36.332 --> 43:38.300
Let's go! Move it!

43:38.335 --> 43:40.836
Come on! Move it!
Find cover!

43:54.881 --> 43:56.982
<i>Let's go!
Get up there!</i>

43:57.016 --> 43:59.616
<i>Get behind that entrance!</i>

43:59.651 --> 44:02.618
<i>First squad,
get behind that trash!</i>

44:03.585 --> 44:05.953
<i>Clear that pillbox!</i>

44:15.960 --> 44:17.860
First platoon, left flank!

44:17.894 --> 44:20.496
<i>Let's go! Let's move it!
Let's go! Get a move on!</i>

44:20.530 --> 44:22.664
<i>Get up that hill!</i>

44:24.733 --> 44:27.167
<i>Machine guns,
high and right!</i>

44:29.637 --> 44:32.071
Get up the hill!
Let's go!

45:02.760 --> 45:06.162
<i>- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!</i>

46:11.606 --> 46:13.740
Might be a trap.

47:17.230 --> 47:19.799
Lots of people
fired mortars up here.

47:20.734 --> 47:22.835
That doesn't matter.

47:29.609 --> 47:32.077
What the hell is the
matter with you two?

51:35.219 --> 51:39.222
- Find anything?
- No.

51:40.692 --> 51:42.693
All right, let's get
these boots squared away.

51:42.727 --> 51:44.227
Where's Burgie?

52:21.231 --> 52:24.400
<i>Yeah-ha-ha!
I got him!</i>

52:24.435 --> 52:26.402
How's that?
A clean shot.

52:26.436 --> 52:28.437
- I got me a Jap.
- You see him go down?

52:28.472 --> 52:30.306
<i>- Heck of a shot.
- Yeah, I got him.</i>

52:30.340 --> 52:33.109
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

52:33.143 --> 52:35.645
Do you feel good? Huh?

52:35.679 --> 52:38.413
Killed your first Jap?
He's a damn kid!

52:38.448 --> 52:40.582
What's your problem?
He's a Jap.

52:40.616 --> 52:42.984
We're here
to kill Japs, ain't we?

52:49.159 --> 52:51.227
<i>Check him out.</i>

52:54.297 --> 52:56.799
Don't look like he's
got anything at all.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.654
Burgie.

54:03.397 --> 54:05.531
Where'd you get this, Hammer?

54:06.667 --> 54:09.002
Gunny Haney gave it to me.

54:10.838 --> 54:12.472
Pops.

54:12.506 --> 54:14.541
Took it with him
from Guadalcanal

54:14.575 --> 54:16.176
All the way to Peleliu.

54:20.714 --> 54:23.316
I heard Leyden made it
back to the States.

54:23.350 --> 54:26.120
Son of a bitch always
said he was first.

54:28.223 --> 54:31.892
All right, enough with the sunbathing.
Let's go, move out.

54:53.344 --> 54:56.612
<i>We dropped some new bomb
on the Jap mainland.</i>

54:56.646 --> 54:59.681
- Don't that beat all.
- No. Oh, no.

54:59.716 --> 55:02.517
This one's different--
vaporized an entire city

55:02.551 --> 55:05.620
<i>In the blink of an eye.</i>

55:05.654 --> 55:08.555
- How?
- I don't know.

55:08.590 --> 55:11.758
Anyway, killed a lot of Japs.

55:13.560 --> 55:17.964
Oh, word is battalion mess is
serving cokes and steaks tonight.

55:17.998 --> 55:20.232
Might even get a movie.

55:21.568 --> 55:23.235
<i>Let's go! Load up!</i>

55:23.269 --> 55:25.903
<i>Let's go! Get it in tight!</i>

55:25.938 --> 55:28.472
<i>Let's get aboard!
Let's move!</i>

55:46.255 --> 55:48.823
<i>We're heading home!</i>

55:48.857 --> 55:51.392
<i>Move out!</i>

55:52.305 --> 55:58.454
