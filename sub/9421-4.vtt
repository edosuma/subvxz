WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:04.280
As a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

00:04.400 --> 00:07.137
until his plane went down
in long island sound.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.932
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings--

00:10.052 --> 00:11.433
Tripp, the empire builder...

00:11.553 --> 00:13.851
You lied to me. You said you knew
about the affair.

00:14.009 --> 00:15.080
I didn't know.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.188
Letitia,
the sophisticated socialite...

00:17.309 --> 00:19.400
Your father was my great love.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.658
Brian, the man of God...

00:20.778 --> 00:22.290
I lied to my wife
and daughters.

00:22.410 --> 00:23.880
I told them
that you were an orphan.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.980
Patrick,
the principled politician,

00:26.100 --> 00:27.680
Karen,
the professional divorcée...

00:27.800 --> 00:29.760
Karen, do not call me
on the home phone number.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.245
I'll always love you, too.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.380
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.367
She was my best friend
in the whole world.

00:35.487 --> 00:37.126
- I want you.
- If Juliet found out...

00:37.246 --> 00:38.627
She won't find out.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.980
You think Simon elder,

00:40.100 --> 00:42.680
the billionaire philanthropist,
blew up your father's plane?

00:42.800 --> 00:44.585
Simon elder is not the man
you think he is,

00:44.712 --> 00:46.225
and your boss isn't either.

00:56.426 --> 00:57.694
Morning, daddy.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.480
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.603
I have to get you some new suits.

01:01.736 --> 01:04.144
The dry cleaner is starting to think
I have a thing for him.

01:04.286 --> 01:06.697
I'm sorry, I stayed here
at the office again.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.080
I been going through this pile
of donation requests.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.075
It's okay. We know you're busy.
It's all good.

01:11.195 --> 01:13.115
I just don't know how
I'm supposed to help people

01:13.198 --> 01:14.876
if I can't make time
to write the checks.

01:14.996 --> 01:16.760
The whole family
sleeps here now. Charming

01:16.889 --> 01:18.045
I work in a sweatshop.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.960
Pookie-kai, Daisy.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.879
Pookie-kai,
long time, no see.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.089
Pookie-kai?
What is pookie-kai?

01:24.209 --> 01:25.780
Secret girl stuff.

01:26.255 --> 01:27.880
Maybe we should go to my desk.

01:28.285 --> 01:29.361
Thanks, guys.

01:30.892 --> 01:32.389
- How are you?
- Nestly?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.615
I'm up to my ears hanging this
new show at the gallery,

01:34.695 --> 01:35.696
I'm reading three books,

01:35.777 --> 01:37.396
none of which I'm making
any headway in,

01:37.516 --> 01:39.115
and I kinda miss my husband.

01:39.242 --> 01:40.242
Yeah, me, too.

01:40.339 --> 01:41.349
He's a great guy.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.580
- That's funny.
- I'm sorry.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.906
Don't be sorry.
I know this is

01:44.000 --> 01:46.647
- a big opportunity for you...
- I am really sorry about-

01:46.820 --> 01:49.430
just for the money but to find out
what happened with your dad,

01:49.583 --> 01:51.780
you don't have to explain
I understand

01:51.900 --> 01:54.060
all the business you do
for the Darlings during the day

01:54.165 --> 01:56.204
and the noble work you do
with their money at night,

01:56.309 --> 01:58.380
I just feel like
there's no us anymore.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.792
It's all Darlings.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.541
Tell you what. We are gonna have
dinner tomorrow night.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.380
I'm not complaining. It's fine.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.305
- You're doing your job.
- Tomorrow night,

02:06.425 --> 02:08.114
just you and me, del posto.

02:08.234 --> 02:10.303
What do you say?
Kiki can stay with your mom.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.099
Say something.
Anything.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.280
You've just admitted to me

02:17.400 --> 02:20.085
that you've been an adulteress
for 40 years.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.080
Forgive me
if I'm short on words.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.871
- Where are you going?
- What?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.527
You haven't been in the same bed
with me for weeks.

02:29.668 --> 02:31.782
I've known that you've
suspected something,

02:31.902 --> 02:34.280
and I also knew
that you'd never say it.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.787
I mean, God forbid
that Tripp Darling

02:36.907 --> 02:39.046
should ever admit
to being...

02:40.600 --> 02:42.876
Affected by anything.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.603
Just tell me one thing.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.662
Our children,

02:47.626 --> 02:49.193
are they all mine?

02:49.592 --> 02:50.592
Yes.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.673
Absolutely.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.681
Oh, God.

02:55.801 --> 02:56.838
What?

02:57.200 --> 03:00.380
The thought that you can be
so sure...

03:00.500 --> 03:03.980
That such attention was paid
to such a prolonged,

03:04.121 --> 03:07.680
continuous insult
that you can say "absolutely,"

03:07.800 --> 03:10.614
as if it were a favor
you did me fondly.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.728
My God, Tish.
It's so sordid.

03:19.501 --> 03:21.665
- Wait, what's the place called?
- Bar known.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.080
Like the little dudes,
bar gnome?

03:24.200 --> 03:26.357
Not gnome, freak show.
Known.

03:26.487 --> 03:27.880
That's too bad.
I was psyched.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.215
I was gonna get, like,
a little red hat.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.110
Will you just come
with me anyway 'cause

03:32.251 --> 03:34.680
it's opening night,
and then there's this...

03:34.800 --> 03:36.902
What are you eating?

03:37.595 --> 03:38.638
Sausage.

03:39.225 --> 03:40.680
What?
What's the matter? Peta?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.580
No, I've just been
all queasy all morning

03:42.700 --> 03:44.271
and I'm, like,
a little bit spinny.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.856
Will you just tell me,
Jeremy,

03:45.976 --> 03:47.270
are you coming with me
or not?

03:47.390 --> 03:49.773
I gotta make sure Juliet's not
gonna be there. But as for me,

03:49.855 --> 03:52.613
tomorrow night?
Fo sho. I'm already there.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.680
I gotta go.
I'll see ya then, babe. Bye.

03:57.287 --> 03:58.327
What?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.579
- You were just talking to her.
- Who?

04:00.699 --> 04:03.280
- Your secret girlfriend.
- I have no girlfriend.

04:03.453 --> 04:06.880
Oh, yeah? Then who did you spend
600 grand on at bulgari,

04:07.005 --> 04:08.295
Justin Timberlake?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.134
All right, Jules,
I am telling the truth,

04:10.270 --> 04:12.800
I am... I'm pluto.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.180
I'm cold, distant
and alone.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.180
All right.
Well speaking of planets--

04:18.300 --> 04:20.077
pluto is not a planet
anymore.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.116
It will always be
a planet to me.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.280
What is this?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.359
An early birthday present.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.480
Hayden planetarium!

04:34.600 --> 04:36.780
- I got you the whole place.
- Get out.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.076
For rizzle. The entire cosmos
to yourself.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.448
Well, I don't have
a gift for you yet.

04:42.568 --> 04:44.164
It's kinda
three weeks early.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.480
Yes, you do.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.585
You see, there's this new club
opening tomorrow night.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.180
And they begged me,

04:50.300 --> 04:52.380
so I promised
to make an appearance,

04:52.500 --> 04:55.509
- and you can come with me.
- It's not bar known, is it?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.680
Oh, I know! It's like
the worst name ever, right?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.280
Yeah, it's
the absolute worst.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.640
You should just bail on it,

05:01.760 --> 05:03.243
you know?
Stay home, read a book.

05:04.613 --> 05:06.365
Are you on cold medicine?

05:06.639 --> 05:07.646
It's a new club.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.680
They asked me to be there.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.180
And for your information,
I read a book last night.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.967
Reading's a lifestyle, though.
It's an -

05:14.087 --> 05:16.780
Jeremy, I promised. I owe it
to them to be there.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.380
And now, thanks to me,
so do you.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.100
She is decided.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.394
I found something
very interesting, Tripp.

05:26.699 --> 05:28.980
Lookin' in
your dad's calendar?

05:29.100 --> 05:29.980
Yeah.

05:30.100 --> 05:33.180
In the wake of
the massive helpfulness

05:33.300 --> 05:34.423
from the police,

05:34.543 --> 05:36.633
I decided
to go over it again,

05:36.753 --> 05:38.680
check all the names,
all the dates,

05:38.800 --> 05:40.880
see if I could figure out,
you know, who gave dad

05:41.000 --> 05:43.480
all the information
on Simon elder and why.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.726
And my dad
had several meetings

05:45.846 --> 05:48.041
with someone he referred to
only by the letter "c."

05:48.448 --> 05:50.731
- "C"?
- I have no idea who it could be.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.780
Met him once a month,
sometimes twice.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.900
Hang on a second.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.080
There were a few times
I asked your dad

05:57.200 --> 05:59.757
to do some detective work
for me.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.380
Just after Kenneth
was assassinated

06:03.500 --> 06:05.300
was the first one.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.400
And there we others.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.380
When he wanted to...

06:09.500 --> 06:11.680
Maintain
a tasteful distance,

06:11.800 --> 06:15.100
he employed the services
of that man.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.280
"Harold Templeton"?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.234
Well, that's not
his real name.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.300
He was a spy in the 60s
for england...

06:24.500 --> 06:25.780
And China...

06:25.900 --> 06:27.080
And France.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.280
He even did some work
for Kennedy in Cuba.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.380
He managed to make himself
globally unpopular.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.772
You can't mention this
to anyone, not even Lisa.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.680
How do I find him?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.200
Well, there's
a little vineyard in--

06:43.400 --> 06:44.880
just outside of Milan.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.980
It's near our summer place in Italy

06:47.100 --> 06:48.375
where you
and your dad used to

06:48.495 --> 06:50.600
spend some time with us.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.980
They make
a great little wine.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.612
Chiavennasca.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.580
Anyway,
if I remember correctly,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.724
you go to that vineyard...

07:03.200 --> 07:04.988
You ask for that wine...

07:06.127 --> 07:07.766
- Slightly chilled.
- Wait a second.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.514
Are you asking me to go
to Italy to find this guy?

07:10.634 --> 07:11.480
Yeah.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.980
No, I mean, that's where
Dutch always started out

07:14.100 --> 07:15.980
when he was trying
to track him down.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.780
He keeps a very low profile.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.980
Anyway, you ask for the wine,
then see what happens.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.980
If you manage to locate
Mr. Templeton,

07:24.100 --> 07:26.480
he might be able
to explain to you

07:26.600 --> 07:28.328
the origins of the...

07:28.900 --> 07:30.335
Elder dossier.

07:30.455 --> 07:31.456
Who knows?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.997
He may even be able
to tell you who "c" is.

07:34.900 --> 07:35.970
Okay.

07:36.900 --> 07:38.208
I'll go to Italy.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.011
Nick.

07:40.136 --> 07:41.008
Yeah.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.513
Snag a bottle fome,
will you?

07:43.649 --> 07:44.658
Will do.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.180
Chiavennasca.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.765
Chiavennasca. Got it.

08:01.741 --> 08:02.946
Aren't those to die for?

08:03.066 --> 08:05.780
It's like they're made
out of George Clooney.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.784
- How much?
- $1,200.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.780
12...
$1,200?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.580
Do they come
with a kidney?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.504
No, they come
with each other.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.846
What kind of person
spends $1,200 on shoes?

08:19.700 --> 08:20.586
Lisa.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.925
What are you doing here?

08:27.045 --> 08:29.356
Picked up a suit for Nick.
We're going out tomorrow night,

08:29.476 --> 08:32.280
- so I just kinda thought-
- then you have to buy those shoes.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.395
- No, actually--
- oh, yes, actually.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.179
And do get them in raspberry.
I have them.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.179
- I wear them all the time.
- I can't buy shoes

08:39.299 --> 08:41.080
that cost as much
as car insurance.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.528
Lisa, honey, don't be
so financially resistant, okay?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.000
It's just money.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.780
You did a little
shopping today, huh?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.380
No, I did
a little browsing.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.580
Karen Darling
did the shopping.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.880
Right after I told you
our whole world was Darlings,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.480
- Darlings everywhere...
- Yeah.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.480
I ran into her.
We chatted.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.280
- 3 hours later, those shoes showed up.
- Well, that was thoughtful.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.764
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of thought
went into that purchase.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.456
What's the problem?
She sent you a gift.

09:11.545 --> 09:12.565
She does stuff like that.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.280
Why would Karen Darling
send me a gift?

09:14.400 --> 09:17.020
Hey, Lise, you're starting
to sound a little paranoid.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.480
Ok? Sometimes a shoe
is just a shoe.

09:20.068 --> 09:21.402
And sometimes
it's a bomb.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.180
So much for
our night out, huh?

09:24.300 --> 09:26.780
Instead of a great meal
at del posto

09:26.900 --> 09:28.380
and a night of wild sex...

09:28.500 --> 09:32.080
Which I was really
looking forward to...

09:32.200 --> 09:36.680
I get leftovers and a DVD
and you get a, what,

09:36.800 --> 09:38.980
a whirlwind trip
to some villa in Italy

09:39.100 --> 09:40.669
to pick up one bottle
of chiave--

09:40.828 --> 09:41.920
chiavennasca.

09:45.007 --> 09:46.285
Why don't you
come with me?

09:46.407 --> 09:47.852
- I can't. It's work.
- Why not?

09:47.986 --> 09:50.180
- This is work.
- So what if it's work? Come on.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.755
It's a private jet.
There's room.

09:52.074 --> 09:54.848
You know, your mom can watch
Kiki over the weekend.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.680
- Let's go to Italy.
- Yeah?

09:57.514 --> 10:01.285
Look, it's totally free,
and for two days, no Darlings.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.818
No Darlings.

10:23.127 --> 10:25.426
See? Reading. Happy now?

10:25.546 --> 10:26.623
Very nice.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.350
"Babes in toyland"?

10:33.470 --> 10:35.135
I felt bad I didn't have
a gift for you,

10:35.257 --> 10:37.266
- so I rented out the whole angelika.
- For tonight?

10:37.409 --> 10:39.940
- Yeah.
- Well, that is so sweet of you.

10:40.227 --> 10:42.080
- Oh, I know.
- But I can't go.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.680
You have to.
The thing is set.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.980
Well, we have to go
to the club tonight.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.574
I gave my word.
My word is my bond.

10:48.694 --> 10:51.380
Anyways, when I decided
I wanted to read for the remake,

10:51.500 --> 10:54.180
I decided that
I couldn't watch the original

10:54.300 --> 10:57.380
because Annette funicello
is so iconic.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.880
I didn't want to copy.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.980
But it was a really
picturesque thought.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.447
Thanks.

11:08.237 --> 11:10.180
Why aren't you dressed
for school today, Gustav?

11:10.300 --> 11:11.313
I don't want to go.

11:11.433 --> 11:12.980
Is that how they do things
in Sweden?

11:13.100 --> 11:15.780
School's like a tea party,
you go if you want?

11:15.900 --> 11:17.900
What happened to your face?

11:19.516 --> 11:21.180
- Bully hit me.
- Did you hit back?

11:21.300 --> 11:23.480
- Jesus says don't hit back.
- Says who?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.100
My mommy.

11:27.847 --> 11:28.889
Your mommy?

11:29.717 --> 11:31.721
You mean your mommy
who's dead?

11:35.600 --> 11:36.449
Yeah.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.459
Poor kid.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.524
She's in a better place now.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.980
Bully or no bully,
still has to go to school.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.580
Okay, but I'm gonna
get terrorized.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.480
Gustav, the world
is full of bullies

11:49.600 --> 11:50.980
and always will be.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.080
- You can't live in fear.
- What am I supposed to do?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.433
What do you think?
Fight back.

11:56.553 --> 11:58.466
Like David and goliath.
You find a weakness

11:58.588 --> 12:01.500
and you take advantage.
There's your Bible truth for today.

12:17.300 --> 12:21.080
Because I share your passion
for the truth, that's why.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.528
Well, what makes you so sure
the painting's a forgery?

12:23.648 --> 12:25.280
Peter, I don't want
to do this to you.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.980
You've been our doctor
for years.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.380
But Tish and I were passing
through David Frank's gallery

12:29.500 --> 12:32.380
on our way to meet Karen
about a week ago...

12:32.500 --> 12:34.719
I don't know,
maybe it was the light.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.980
And I saw a speck
of prussian blue

12:38.100 --> 12:39.180
in "das kind"--

12:39.300 --> 12:40.574
your painting.

12:41.158 --> 12:42.263
Prussian blue? I...

12:42.389 --> 12:43.780
Yeah, the pigment.

12:43.900 --> 12:47.467
It had not yet been invented
in engel's lifetime.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.756
So I became suspicious.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.880
There's a forger in Belgium

12:54.000 --> 12:56.680
who's becoming quietly famous
in some circles

12:56.800 --> 12:58.408
for this sort of thing.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.833
I'm sorry...

13:02.300 --> 13:04.380
But your painting is a fake.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.620
Stretfield's guaranteed
$6 million.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.341
That painting's our exit strategy.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.952
You've been Tish's o. B.-G. Y. N.
For over three decades.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.552
And this is a little secret.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.605
Trust me.

13:27.096 --> 13:29.604
This is going to go
with me to my grave.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.264
I am curious...

13:32.778 --> 13:33.780
About what?

13:33.900 --> 13:37.138
In all the years that you've
been delivering our children...

13:39.500 --> 13:40.880
Have you ever been aware

13:41.000 --> 13:43.468
that any of them
might not have been mine?

13:44.912 --> 13:46.877
You might look into that for me.

13:46.997 --> 13:48.571
Yeah, sure. I could...

13:49.264 --> 13:50.835
Get you an answer on that,

13:50.968 --> 13:54.042
- sometime next week if you like.
- Tomorrow would be best.

14:10.453 --> 14:12.380
If Natalie Kimpton's
gonna be here all night

14:12.500 --> 14:13.680
with Ryan casdale,

14:13.800 --> 14:17.080
this place is over
before it even began.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.380
What is that?

14:18.500 --> 14:22.162
The old vodka
in the water bottle routine?

14:22.282 --> 14:24.289
That is so 2004.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.960
Does she think
she's fooling anyone?

14:28.080 --> 14:31.118
I'm so tired of that
backstabbing little witch.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.480
What, are you text bombing
your girlfriend?

14:37.600 --> 14:38.980
No. I'm--

14:39.100 --> 14:41.080
I'm betting on polo online.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.980
Oh, my God!

14:43.100 --> 14:44.400
Astrid!

14:47.400 --> 14:49.180
When did you
get back from Andorra?

14:49.300 --> 14:52.480
About two hours ago.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.803
- What's with Boris and Natasha?
- Oh, it's some sort of

14:59.500 --> 15:01.800
you look super hot tonight.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.200
You do, too.

15:09.405 --> 15:12.680
I thought maybe we could...

15:12.800 --> 15:14.580
Pee does not
go well with this dress.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.580
I'll get you another one.

15:20.257 --> 15:22.280
Someone just came in.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.767
- So you want to have a three way?
- It could be my sister.

15:24.887 --> 15:26.780
You are about to have sex
in a public bathroom,

15:26.900 --> 15:30.022
and that is what you're worried
about, your sister?

15:30.142 --> 15:32.432
That is so incredibly lame!

15:35.647 --> 15:38.072
This has got to be
the best part about being rich,

15:38.192 --> 15:40.162
- don't you think?
- What's that, the private jet?

15:40.296 --> 15:42.780
Yeah, no lines,
no security.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.680
And no pesky rules
about cocktails before takeoff.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.100
What do you mean?
In 1st class,

15:47.233 --> 15:49.480
they practically pour
the drinks down your throat.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.180
- Not if you're flying the plane.
- Wait a minute, Clark.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.614
- You're flying the plane?
- Tripp sent me to flight school.

15:54.698 --> 15:56.000
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.080
I'm expecting a real easy trip
across the pond.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.375
You two can just
lean back and relax.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.880
- You guys!
- Hi, Karen.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Hi.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.880
Hey, Lisa,
my shopping buddy.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.619
What a surprise.

16:11.183 --> 16:13.428
- Could you get the luggage for us?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:13.702 --> 16:15.864
Yeah, daddy told us that
you guys were taking the jet,

16:15.984 --> 16:18.398
so we thought we would just hitchhike.
You don't mind. Do you?

16:18.482 --> 16:20.033
No, no, no, no. It's fine.

16:21.276 --> 16:22.353
It's...

16:22.964 --> 16:24.243
Perfect.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.745
This place is incredible.

16:45.888 --> 16:48.080
Please tell me that we don't
have to spend the whole day

16:48.200 --> 16:49.380
with Karen and Freddy.

16:49.553 --> 16:51.142
I'm guessing
that Freddy's out golfing

16:51.285 --> 16:54.017
and Karen's out cold.
We can just sneak out of here.

16:54.137 --> 16:55.727
Buon giorno, amici.

16:55.847 --> 16:58.021
Hey, Karen.
You're up early.

16:58.141 --> 17:00.580
I know. The espresso
in Italy is so good.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.901
I've had, like, four already.

17:03.021 --> 17:05.530
You guys look
freshly laid.

17:05.685 --> 17:06.694
Am I interrupting?

17:06.814 --> 17:08.480
- Not at all.
- No.

17:08.598 --> 17:10.780
- What do you want to do today?
- What do we want to do?

17:10.931 --> 17:14.079
Well, Karen I have some stuff
to do for your dad, a little business.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.079
We don't mind.
We're game for anything.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.780
Absolutely anything.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.079
Nick and I don't get
to spend much time alone,

17:21.200 --> 17:22.900
so we're...

17:24.300 --> 17:26.280
I get...

17:26.400 --> 17:27.540
I get it.

17:28.287 --> 17:29.600
"Love time."

17:30.300 --> 17:31.400
Yeah.

17:33.029 --> 17:34.280
I hope that's not a problem.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.480
No, not at all.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.051
You go your way,
we'll go ours.

17:37.171 --> 17:38.511
Italy's big, you know?

17:39.141 --> 17:42.280
Oh, my God!
These are so good.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.277
These are lto, molto yummy.
You want some?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.038
- Holy crap!
- What?

17:57.296 --> 17:58.880
I hope Ryan's taking penicillin.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.800
That girl is septic.

18:04.185 --> 18:05.580
Are there any pictures of me?

18:05.700 --> 18:07.200
I haven't looked.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.680
Listen, I think my wife
is on to us, all right?

18:09.800 --> 18:12.100
So we're just gonna
have to be a little more...

18:13.728 --> 18:14.626
Listen.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.767
What is it?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.810
Chora.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.800
Chora?

18:26.730 --> 18:27.914
That's your bully?

18:28.792 --> 18:29.807
She's a girl!

18:30.017 --> 18:31.508
Come on.
Get it together, man.

18:32.232 --> 18:34.534
I'll pick you up
after school.

18:41.006 --> 18:43.143
You better run, hot dog.
Mama's hungry!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.080
Right this way.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.280
Allora, today, we have
for to taste

18:50.400 --> 18:52.880
is the rosso di valtellina.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.381
Also we have the Pinot nero
and a very nice gragnano.

18:56.701 --> 18:58.361
- Signora.
- Grazie.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.780
Prego. Signore.

19:00.900 --> 19:01.956
Thank you.

19:03.837 --> 19:06.731
You dot happen to have
chiavennasca, do you?

19:07.150 --> 19:08.018
Si

19:08.300 --> 19:10.727
- slightly chilled?
- Slightly chilled?

19:11.432 --> 19:13.050
Vado lo domandare.

19:14.152 --> 19:17.452
Okay, who's stalking who?
It's such a puzzle.

19:17.572 --> 19:18.572
Hi.

19:19.366 --> 19:22.100
- Hi, Karen.
- Hello.

19:22.300 --> 19:23.780
- How are you? Freddy.
- Nick.

19:24.001 --> 19:27.379
So I guess Italy's not
as big as I thought,

19:27.499 --> 19:29.464
it's gettin' smaller
all the time.

19:30.099 --> 19:31.979
Lei vuole mangiare con noi?

19:32.279 --> 19:33.292
Do you mind if--

19:33.416 --> 19:34.949
'cause we drove
all the way here,

19:35.069 --> 19:38.980
and it'll be so awkward
if you're sitting next to us

19:39.100 --> 19:40.680
but not, you know, with us.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.480
We wouldn't want it
to be awkward.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.000
Oh, perfect. Okay.
I love this now.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.480
- How the hell did you get in here?
- I followed the flower delivery guy.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.980
Don't worry. Your wife
is out getting waxed.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.480
I'm sorry.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.680
I meant your sister.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.280
- What the hell is this?
- Publicity stunt.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.080
You kissed
Ryan "creepo" casdale.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.980
My agent told me to.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.083
Does your agent make decisions
for your lips?

20:10.233 --> 20:11.237
What about us?

20:11.395 --> 20:13.980
Jeremy, what do I want
with some actor

20:14.100 --> 20:17.451
who looks in the mirror
more often than I do?

20:19.972 --> 20:21.166
He's a boy.

20:22.116 --> 20:23.139
He's a baby.

20:23.712 --> 20:24.772
You're my man.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.315
You're my big man.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.275
You didn't sleep with him?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.380
I fell asleep a few times
while he was talking,

20:32.500 --> 20:34.452
- but that's about it.
- Promise?

20:35.200 --> 20:36.504
I promise.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.241
I do.

20:38.361 --> 20:39.386
Here.

20:49.663 --> 20:51.380
Wait, wait.
I have to tell you something.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.588
What?

20:53.075 --> 20:55.280
You want me to put on
explosions in the sky?

20:55.400 --> 20:58.000
Yeah. But I have to
tell you something.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.024
Don't you ever knock?

21:11.144 --> 21:12.484
That's your girlfriend?

21:12.604 --> 21:14.780
I was gonna tell you about it.
I swear.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.080
So those tickets
to "babes in toyland,"

21:17.200 --> 21:18.657
they weren't a gift at all?

21:18.777 --> 21:19.980
They were subterfuge?

21:20.100 --> 21:23.120
- They were subterfuge and a gift.
- And you!

21:23.240 --> 21:25.488
- What?
- Weren't my bangs enough?

21:25.615 --> 21:27.469
Oh, it was a completely
different approach-

21:27.589 --> 21:29.580
- get out of my house, you whore!
- Let it go.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.520
Can't we just all talk
about this like adults?

21:31.640 --> 21:33.280
Get her drippy butt
out of my house!

21:33.431 --> 21:35.173
- No!
- What?

21:36.727 --> 21:38.195
She's not leaving.

21:39.559 --> 21:40.577
This is...

21:40.991 --> 21:43.312
Utterly mortifying.

21:43.754 --> 21:44.766
This is...

21:44.886 --> 21:46.980
The worst thing
that's ever happened.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.580
Juliet, you are my sister,
and I love you.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.292
But I can't choose sides.

21:54.173 --> 21:55.306
Well, guess what.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.725
You just did.

22:01.447 --> 22:03.100
I gotta go throw up.

22:07.721 --> 22:09.580
You know, even when we were little,

22:09.700 --> 22:12.480
- I knew you were grounded.
- I got grounded a few times, maybe.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.835
I don't know if I was grounded.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.080
Yeah, when I met him
at William and Mary,

22:16.200 --> 22:17.434
he was kind of a flake.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.510
A naughty flake.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.220
Well, you know,

22:22.340 --> 22:24.639
I've just always seen him
as such an old soul.

22:24.759 --> 22:26.080
I don't know if you know him

22:26.200 --> 22:28.180
as well as you think you do,
Karen, really.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.080
I don't think
you do either, Lisa.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.180
I've known him for a long ti--
longer than you, and I--

22:33.300 --> 22:36.484
well, I remember Nick and I
walking on the beach

22:37.011 --> 22:39.237
and the way the sun
hit your hair. It just...

22:39.768 --> 22:41.031
Glistened.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.297
Signore George.

22:42.997 --> 22:43.825
Yeah.

22:43.945 --> 22:46.280
Would you follow me,
please, to the tasting room?

22:46.485 --> 22:48.080
Yeah, I guess

22:48.200 --> 22:50.957
you asked for
the chiavennasca.

22:51.077 --> 22:52.876
Yeah, I did.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.920
If you'll excuse me,

22:55.040 --> 22:58.300
I just have
some family business.

23:01.558 --> 23:03.261
All right.
You all keep bonding.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.679
Will do.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.314
Come il tuo italiano?

23:14.900 --> 23:17.080
Non buono.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.652
Mi dispiace.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.821
What a pity.
To speak English

23:21.941 --> 23:25.721
puts me in mind
of irretrievable times.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.000
Ah, well.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.875
This the chiavennasca?

23:33.995 --> 23:36.900
No, no. It's vin ordinaire.

23:43.069 --> 23:44.854
So you're Dutch's boy?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.043
Yeah.

23:48.400 --> 23:49.455
I guess so.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.310
For what do you seek?

23:53.253 --> 23:55.680
When my dad died, his briefcase
was full of information

23:55.800 --> 23:58.100
about Simon elder.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.894
Incriminating information.

24:01.213 --> 24:03.180
Elder, as in
the techno-philanthropist?

24:03.300 --> 24:04.400
Yeah.

24:07.114 --> 24:09.851
Any idea why he might have
had a file like that?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.780
Did I do something wrong?

24:13.900 --> 24:15.780
I'm sorry.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.680
If you are who you say you are,
I will find you.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.069
If not, well.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.880
Those are your bad dreams.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.177
Arrivederci.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.780
Me wearing
the superman underoos

24:28.900 --> 24:30.380
and he's wearing
wonder woman.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.183
I'm not kidding.

24:32.303 --> 24:33.560
There he is.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.300
Hi, baby. Just in time.

24:38.658 --> 24:40.219
- What's going on?
- We can go.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.680
No. We've moved on
to spirits.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.281
Nick,
we're drinking grappa.

24:48.611 --> 24:50.746
Maybe the two of you
have had enough?

24:51.800 --> 24:54.788
Loosen up, baby.
We are in India.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.281
We are?

24:56.500 --> 24:58.043
What did I just say?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.880
You said we were in India.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Nick.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.256
It's grappa.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.886
Remember?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.954
Remember what?
What about grappa?

25:11.754 --> 25:13.141
We had a couple of bottles

25:13.261 --> 25:15.268
the night
that Nick proposed to me.

25:19.904 --> 25:21.232
Nick proposed to you?

25:21.352 --> 25:23.880
- You didn't tell her?
- When would that have come up?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.445
When did he propose to you?

25:25.565 --> 25:27.880
When we were 19.
Why didn't you tell her?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.734
You're so secretive.

25:30.191 --> 25:31.368
Because we were 19.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.079
Exactly. We were 19.
It's ancient history.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.880
It was down by the lake,
just down--

25:36.000 --> 25:38.208
down the hill
from where we're all staying.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.900
And we...
I don't know, we'd been,

25:41.200 --> 25:43.480
like, sailing all day
or playing tennis.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.680
I just remember him saying
that he--

25:45.800 --> 25:47.580
he knew it wasn't
gonna be easy

25:47.700 --> 25:50.780
because I was so rich
and he wasn't.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.765
But he knew we were
supposed to be together.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.393
Hey, Karen, can we...

25:56.513 --> 25:59.020
Oh, let her finish.
Let her finish.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.356
And then we, you know,

26:01.476 --> 26:03.780
we drank a bunch of grappa.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.985
- And, um...
- Lisa.

26:06.105 --> 26:09.100
- You know, just spent time...
- Lisa, I should've told you.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.580
Thanks.

26:14.700 --> 26:15.912
I'm sorry.

26:19.700 --> 26:21.292
God,
you are a bitch sometimes.

26:21.412 --> 26:24.100
I know.
It's a problem.

26:32.885 --> 26:34.426
Lisa come on. I was 19.

26:34.546 --> 26:37.000
I was in Italy.
I was drunk on grappa.

26:37.521 --> 26:39.080
Everyone proposes
when they're 19.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.580
- It didn't mean anything.
- Well, it meant something to her.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.426
And it certainly
would've meant something

26:43.546 --> 26:44.769
if she'd said yes.

26:44.889 --> 26:47.017
Lisa, it was a thousand years ago.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.480
When we started dating,
we exchanged plenty of stories

26:49.600 --> 26:51.680
about our old boyfriends
and girlfriends, remember?

26:51.800 --> 26:53.873
- Yeah, so?
- There must have been some reason

26:54.000 --> 26:55.871
you decided to leave
this particular one out

26:55.992 --> 26:58.037
unless maybe you forgot.
Did you forget?

27:01.500 --> 27:02.580
I don't understand

27:02.700 --> 27:04.789
why you don't just go
to the headmaster

27:04.909 --> 27:07.380
and tell him this bullying
is taking place.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.373
Because the little orphan
is never gonna learn

27:09.495 --> 27:12.180
- how to stick up for himself.
- Like you learned?

27:12.300 --> 27:13.967
18 years of being beat up by girls,

27:14.118 --> 27:16.600
and what's his revenge?
The ministry.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.780
- That's awful.
- Every summer, your Uncle Brian

27:19.900 --> 27:21.980
would come back from vacation
with aunt Deirdre

27:22.100 --> 27:23.880
and cousin derinda
covered in bruises.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.101
It was tragic.

27:25.221 --> 27:27.680
What did they call you again?
The princess?

27:27.800 --> 27:29.516
What did they call you again,
fatty-paddy?

27:29.636 --> 27:31.380
I wouldn't mind
a change subject.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.680
I swear, sometimes I don't know
where you children come from.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.800
Why did you really enter
the church, Uncle Brian?

27:38.300 --> 27:41.680
I didn't see anywhere else
in the world I fit in.

27:41.800 --> 27:45.580
I didn't want to pursue business
or politics.

27:45.700 --> 27:48.780
I never...
Felt really well liked.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.880
So a life of leisure
didn't seem appealing.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.880
You need friends
for that kind of thing.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.580
So, you know, I guess
I really never felt

27:55.700 --> 27:58.100
a part of the human family.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.562
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.284
Ellen, thank you.

28:09.867 --> 28:11.314
Take it easy, sailor.

28:11.434 --> 28:13.218
You're gonna overheat
your blood.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.151
Sorry.

28:15.271 --> 28:18.651
I haven't seen a child
pepper food that vigorously

28:18.785 --> 28:20.532
since you were a boy, Brian.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.000
Bon appetit.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.480
You should probably
answer that.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.180
I'm sure
it's your girlfriend Karen

28:29.300 --> 28:31.876
calling to invite you
for a midnight swim...

28:31.996 --> 28:35.200
Or maybe another romantic
grappa party or something.

28:37.199 --> 28:38.080
Pronto?

28:38.200 --> 28:40.434
Mr. George.
Harold Templeton.

28:41.166 --> 28:43.096
May we convene?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.080
I apologize for my abrupt exit
the last time.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.280
But you can never be too sure
who's who in my line of work.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.180
Your father
would've understood.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.816
He was...
Also a complex man.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.681
What happened?

28:57.347 --> 28:58.778
Three months ago,
he asked me

28:58.898 --> 29:00.880
compile information
on Simon elder--

29:01.000 --> 29:02.080
anything vexing.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.780
What for?
To blackmail him?

29:03.900 --> 29:06.680
I never asked.
It was not my concern.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.449
But when your father
came to me a 2nd time

29:08.544 --> 29:10.623
and asked me to perform
similar due diligence

29:10.743 --> 29:12.959
on Tripp Darling,
well, I realized

29:13.079 --> 29:14.580
he was walking
for someone else,

29:14.700 --> 29:16.415
so I washed my hands
of it.

29:19.300 --> 29:23.080
So who was my father
working for? Do you know?

29:23.200 --> 29:25.380
Did he ever mention someone
that he referred to

29:25.500 --> 29:26.842
by the letter "c"?

29:28.401 --> 29:29.401
No.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.200
Not that I recall.

29:33.044 --> 29:36.707
And there's your chiavennasca
for Mr. Darling.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.778
- Hey.
- Hey

29:46.738 --> 29:48.457
I'm really sorry
about earlier.

29:48.577 --> 29:49.579
You know what?

29:49.700 --> 29:51.718
Save it for someone who cares.

29:54.858 --> 29:56.880
I don't want these shoes
anymore. You know why?

29:57.013 --> 29:59.380
- They don't fit?
- No, actually, they fit fine.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.980
I don't want these shoes
because these shoes--

30:02.100 --> 30:04.480
these $1,200 shoes--

30:04.600 --> 30:06.804
and for everything that is
selfish and foul

30:06.924 --> 30:08.880
and consumptive
and creepy about you.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.913
Nick and I have...
A daughter.

30:12.700 --> 30:14.180
And, you have this dream,

30:14.300 --> 30:15.677
and it's never
going to come true.

30:15.821 --> 30:17.931
So stay away from my husband
and...

30:18.053 --> 30:19.584
Stay out of my way.

30:27.689 --> 30:29.509
- Who was that, baby?
- Nobody.

30:30.735 --> 30:32.662
Make me a drink,
would you?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.600
Go away.

30:55.899 --> 30:57.079
We need to talk.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.052
I'm not speaking to you,
traitor.

31:04.700 --> 31:06.624
Juliet... I love her.

31:06.949 --> 31:07.972
Love?

31:11.400 --> 31:13.366
Okay, I really like her.

31:13.486 --> 31:14.562
Like?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.556
I'm moderately interest--

31:17.686 --> 31:19.205
why can't you be cool
about this?

31:19.325 --> 31:20.980
Because she doesn't care
about you.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.911
She's only using you to get at me.

31:23.444 --> 31:25.680
Now I get it. Yeah.
It's about you. Right?

31:25.800 --> 31:28.756
- Everything is just all about you.
- I'm just trying to protect you.

31:28.876 --> 31:30.824
You don't have to!
You're the one running around

31:30.920 --> 31:32.680
telling everyone
you want to be independent.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.342
You want your own career,
to move out.

31:34.462 --> 31:36.380
You can't even let
your twin brother date someone

31:36.500 --> 31:38.558
you had a stupid fight with
over bangs? Why?

31:38.678 --> 31:42.437
Because it makes you feel so lonely
and freaked out and threatened.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.182
I mean, bangs?

31:50.953 --> 31:52.934
I feel
so far from home.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.950
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

31:56.070 --> 31:59.704
I hate that we can't just get on
a plane right now and go.

32:01.458 --> 32:02.580
Well, we could,

32:02.700 --> 32:05.080
but we'd have to fly
with Karen and Freddy.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.500
Well, they have
their private jet.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.480
We are flying back like--
like normal people

32:10.600 --> 32:13.080
with... lines and security

32:13.200 --> 32:15.136
and peanuts and back pain

32:15.256 --> 32:17.617
and... life.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.000
God...

32:24.200 --> 32:27.500
It's...
Weird being married.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.568
It's so weird.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.500
Yeah...

32:34.700 --> 32:36.200
It is.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.080
Promise me something.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.200
What?

32:41.550 --> 32:43.870
Promise me that we are never
going to have to come

32:44.011 --> 32:47.200
all the way to Italy for a stupid
bottle of wine again, please.

33:00.829 --> 33:02.068
Lisa...

33:03.500 --> 33:05.798
We didn't come here
for a bottle of wine.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.380
I needed to meet with a guy
who did some work for my dad.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.780
When did you do that?

33:11.900 --> 33:14.200
When I went down
to the wine cellar.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.000
He's a spy.

33:17.601 --> 33:18.880
It's a long story.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.475
I look forward to hearing
about it halfway over the Atlantic.

33:26.394 --> 33:28.480
You know, I count on you
for so much, Lise.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.900
You know that?

33:31.331 --> 33:33.464
- A little.
- When I look at you,

33:33.584 --> 33:36.634
here's this perfect line
from me through you

33:36.754 --> 33:38.505
to the center of the earth.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.500
You keep me connected
to everything.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.392
You do the same for me.

33:45.484 --> 33:47.080
And Kiki does it
for both of us.

33:47.200 --> 33:50.083
It's a...
It's a beautiful thing.

33:50.224 --> 33:52.646
You know, I don't think my dad
felt that way about anyone.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.780
You don't think he felt
that way about you?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.297
I don't know.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.866
I really don't.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.377
Lei vuole fare l'amore?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.980
You picked up
a little Italian?

34:10.100 --> 34:11.380
Enough to get by.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.500
Yeah?

34:30.002 --> 34:31.878
Victoria,
would you excuse us?

34:31.998 --> 34:32.998
Yes, sir.

34:33.097 --> 34:35.985
Thank you so much...

34:36.914 --> 34:38.199
For all you do.

34:45.687 --> 34:47.900
Silver up to snuff?

34:52.800 --> 34:54.600
It's getting there.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.760
We need to talk.

35:04.608 --> 35:05.768
What's that?

35:08.390 --> 35:10.186
D. N. A. Results.

35:11.793 --> 35:12.897
You lied to me.

35:13.017 --> 35:14.857
What the hell
have you done?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.080
I found out
what I needed to now.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.480
I found out
the only way that I could

35:21.600 --> 35:24.659
give the fact that my wife
doesn't tell me the truth.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.801
So...

35:27.500 --> 35:28.537
So you know?

35:29.500 --> 35:31.318
I haven't read
the results.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.246
I won't.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.671
I want to hear it
from you.

35:39.300 --> 35:40.845
Which of our children

35:41.904 --> 35:43.132
isn't mine?

35:44.401 --> 35:47.139
Which one is Dutch's?

35:55.380 --> 35:56.536
I'll tell you.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.487
But you've got to promise me
nothing will change...

36:01.900 --> 36:03.572
As far as the children
are concerned.

36:03.692 --> 36:06.246
I don't have to
promise you anything.

36:07.113 --> 36:08.494
You took my life--

36:09.700 --> 36:12.580
you took my life
that I placed in your hands

36:12.700 --> 36:15.680
to help me carry it
safely to the grave,

36:15.833 --> 36:19.103
and you laid it on every bedside
table you could find

36:19.223 --> 36:20.880
while you pursued
whatever it was

36:21.000 --> 36:23.380
you were pursuing
all those years.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.980
I hope it was
the obliteration of yourself,

36:26.100 --> 36:28.617
because, my God,
that's what you've achieved.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.500
Just tell me the truth...

36:31.700 --> 36:33.583
Or leave right now.

36:33.783 --> 36:35.000
I mean it.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.942
You're the only woman
in the world for me, Tish.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.180
But can't live every day

36:43.300 --> 36:45.946
with my face being pushed
into this filth.

36:47.945 --> 36:50.600
If you want me
in that bed tonight...

36:53.800 --> 36:55.200
Tell me.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.215
All right.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.218
All right.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.142
I'll tell you.

37:24.600 --> 37:28.000
No, chora!
You're hurting me!

37:28.852 --> 37:29.855
What's the matter?

37:29.975 --> 37:31.362
You gotta be nicer to me,
or else

37:31.467 --> 37:34.880
- I'll tell Mei ling hwa the truth.
- What is this, blackmail?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.180
You told me to find
a weakness.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.292
You cunning little turd.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.217
What do you want?

37:47.800 --> 37:49.296
Get off of me!

37:50.511 --> 37:52.518
Help me. Please.

37:57.700 --> 37:58.736
Hi, chora.

38:00.286 --> 38:02.612
Those are nice hair clips.
What are those, bumblebees?

38:02.732 --> 38:03.753
Hornets.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.824
You know God, chora?
Well, he's sorta my boss.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.910
And you see that boy
over there?

38:10.600 --> 38:11.702
God told me

38:12.369 --> 38:14.456
you're not being
very nice to him.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.677
And God is so disappointed.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.795
So from now on, he wants
you two to be friends.

38:19.915 --> 38:23.480
Otherwise you're gonna burn
in hell for eternity,

38:23.600 --> 38:25.919
and eternity's
a very long time.

38:29.891 --> 38:30.934
Are we clear?

38:32.303 --> 38:33.414
Good girl.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.080
So I'm assuming you met
our friend--Mr. Templeton?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.680
Yes, I did.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.480
And what did he have
to say?

38:49.600 --> 38:51.280
Well, you were right.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.488
He put the elder file
together for dad.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.700
Yeah, I figured.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.847
To your good health.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.700
Cheers.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.180
So what do you think?

39:12.300 --> 39:13.390
Be honest.

39:14.900 --> 39:16.922
My father was working
for someone else.

39:25.300 --> 39:27.905
Could it be that "c"
that was in his calendar?

39:28.025 --> 39:29.553
I don't know. Maybe.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.534
But he was gathering
that information for someone.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.997
And Templeton stopped helping
when he found out about it.

39:36.117 --> 39:37.180
So that dossier,

39:37.300 --> 39:39.490
all that information
on Simon elder,

39:40.400 --> 39:44.171
that wasn't just Dutch
doing... diligent work

39:44.291 --> 39:45.323
on my behalf?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.700
No, it doesn't look like it.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.880
He was gathering information
about you as well.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.323
- About me?
- Yeah.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.580
- I'm sorry.
- Why? You didn't do it.

40:04.700 --> 40:07.400
- I know, but he--
- no, you're you.

40:07.648 --> 40:10.740
And you're good.
That's true.

40:13.700 --> 40:14.754
Well...

40:16.591 --> 40:18.276
Anything happen
while I was gone?

40:20.300 --> 40:21.816
Nothing unexpected.

40:23.300 --> 40:26.246
Things continue
to reveal themselves.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.050
Reality.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.127
I like looking
at the stars because...

40:46.200 --> 40:47.754
You know, they're so...

40:48.300 --> 40:50.529
Hot and fiery
and explosive,

40:51.100 --> 40:53.380
but it feels totally safe
and totally exciting

40:53.500 --> 40:55.080
all at the same time,
you know?

40:55.200 --> 40:58.200
I never thought a girl
could make me feel that way.

41:02.144 --> 41:03.251
But you do.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.300
Looking at you is like
looking at the stars.

41:12.481 --> 41:14.880
You make me feel like I'm--
I'm a part of everything,

41:15.000 --> 41:16.500
like I have a place.

41:18.845 --> 41:20.601
Are you being for real?

41:23.819 --> 41:25.357
Natalie, I'm "for realer"
with you

41:25.531 --> 41:27.274
than I've ever been
with anybody.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.444
Me, too.

41:33.500 --> 41:34.824
Maybe we're in love.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.121
I think we are.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.580
Jeremy.

41:51.700 --> 41:52.700
Yeah.

41:55.700 --> 41:56.982
I'm pregnant.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.000
That's wet.

42:20.778 --> 42:21.966
Nicholas George?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.400
Simon elder.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.600
Want to go for a ride?

42:30.547 --> 42:31.379
Sure.
