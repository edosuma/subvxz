00:41.867 --> 00:43.739
<i>You get engaged
and you can kiss them.</i>

00:43.739 --> 00:46.220
First you have to get engaged
in order to kiss someone.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.786
- Those are the rules.
- We know.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.266
If you kiss someone

00:49.266 --> 00:50.963
instead of getting engaged
first, what's easier?

00:51.964 --> 00:53.705
- Is it good?
It feels good.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.794
It feels like you're in love.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.492
Oh, my goodness.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.885
- They are hot.
- They're freaking engaged.

00:59.885 --> 01:00.886
What happened?

01:00.886 --> 01:03.019
You guys are so cute.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.150
It's, like, gross,
I want to throw up.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.371
- That's after the drinks.
Speaking of...

01:07.371 --> 01:10.331
To Abby and Matt
on their engagement.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.506
- Oh!
- Oh.

01:11.506 --> 01:15.249
May you be each other's
silent guardians

01:15.249 --> 01:17.816
and watchful protectors.

01:18.643 --> 01:21.559
You may not be the couple
that New York deserves,

01:23.387 --> 01:24.606
but you're the one it needs.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.043
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

01:27.043 --> 01:28.653
Did you just quote
<i>The Dark Knight?</i>

01:28.653 --> 01:30.046
Uh, did I? I was just riffing.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.179
Hmm. OK.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.398
Now we know who's not giving
a toast at the wedding.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.965
Or speaking
at the rehearsal dinner.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.575
Or doing talking of any kind.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.099
- Uh, rude.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.449
Matt, I'm still
your best man, right?

01:41.449 --> 01:43.581
Dude, you know
I have three brothers.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.453
They love you
because they have to.

01:45.453 --> 01:46.976
I love you
because I choose to.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.673
- I'm gonna get shots!
- Yeah.

01:48.673 --> 01:51.459
Thank you. What a good guy.
Not the best man.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.897
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
You guys are amazing.

01:54.897 --> 01:57.421
I can't believe you flew all
the way out from LA for this.

01:57.421 --> 02:00.294
We did and we just...
and we came here for this.

02:00.294 --> 02:01.686
That's it, nothing else,

02:01.686 --> 02:03.775
because that's what
best friends do and stuff.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.386
You got <i>Hamilton</i> tickets,
didn't you?

02:05.386 --> 02:07.605
Second row. Supposedly
Aaron Burr spits on you.

02:10.304 --> 02:13.959
So... does it feel
any different?

02:13.959 --> 02:17.702
It will when Matt's lease is up
and he moves in next month.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.878
- Finally.
- Finally.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.317
OK.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.883
Oh, shot, shots.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.711
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, thank you.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.365
Oh, cheers.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.152
- Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
- Hmm.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.892
Guess who's at the bar.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.592
Oh, shit. That's Kenzie Scott.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.728
Is it just me,
or is she moving in slow motion?

02:44.381 --> 02:46.122
She's definitely moving
in slow motion.

02:49.299 --> 02:51.780
She's in town
shooting a Tarantino movie.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.565
Wait, I thought she was doing
the new Christopher Nolan film.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.828
She's doing both
at the same time.

02:57.481 --> 02:58.917
Dude, take your shot.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.224
Yeah, right.
What would I even say to her?

03:01.224 --> 03:05.141
- I meant your tequila shot.
- Oh.

03:07.535 --> 03:11.103
Uh, but... you could
go talk to her.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.541
- She's definitely on my list.
- Hm-hmm.

03:13.541 --> 03:14.846
What list?

03:14.846 --> 03:17.284
You know,
my celebrity free-pass list.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.547
Since when do you
have a free-pass list?

03:19.547 --> 03:21.897
Oh, my God. You two
haven't spoken about this?

03:21.897 --> 03:24.465
Well, I don't, like,
actually have a list.

03:24.465 --> 03:27.119
But if I did,
Kenzie Scott would be on it.

03:27.119 --> 03:30.079
You don't need a list
to want to be with Kenzie Scott.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.559
True, dat.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.735
Like if Oscar Isaac
walked into this bar right now,

03:33.735 --> 03:35.606
we wouldn't be having
the same conversation?

03:35.606 --> 03:37.129
Well, Oscar Isaac is different.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.479
- He's Oscar Isaac.
- Uh-huh.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.698
Kenzie Scott is just
such an obvious choice.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.788
I didn't realize there were
bonus points for being original.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.616
I don't know,
I guess I just expected

03:45.616 --> 03:47.879
someone with
a little more personality.

03:47.879 --> 03:50.099
I think maybe our lists
mean different things.

03:51.883 --> 03:55.931
OK. So, who else
is on this list?

03:55.931 --> 04:00.805
I... don't really know.
Who else is on yours?

04:00.805 --> 04:03.025
I don't really know, either.

04:03.025 --> 04:07.203
All right, that's it.
You guys are making lists.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.818
OK, so the celebrities
should be enough of a reach

04:13.818 --> 04:15.124
to feel like a fantasy...

04:15.124 --> 04:17.168
With a hint of achievability.

04:17.168 --> 04:19.911
- Nick Viall.
- That guy from <i>The Bachelor?</i>

04:19.911 --> 04:21.130
- Yeah.
- Which season?

04:21.130 --> 04:23.219
- Like, all of them.
- No, no, no.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.438
There are no vetoes.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.961
For Jack Black there are vetoes.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.963
- No.
- Of course he wants Jack Black.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.617
- Mark it down.
- Wrong.

04:29.617 --> 04:30.705
Wrong?

04:30.705 --> 04:32.272
- Wrong wrong.
<i>- Kung Fu Panda.</i>

04:35.840 --> 04:41.150
- Emily... I'm sorry Emily who?
- Raja... Rajatowski.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.021
- That was so close.
- No, it wasn't.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.719
- Ratajkowski.
- Ratajkowski.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.677
You can barely
pronounce her name.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.288
So, what's that matter with her?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.420
- Literally nothing.
- Hm-hmm.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.117
- That's what's up.
- Yes.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.076
- Chloe.
- Hmm?

04:54.076 --> 04:55.599
You have been silent.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.037
- Who is on your list?
- Tessa Thompson,

04:59.037 --> 05:02.214
Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez,
Halle Berry, Sarah Paulson.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.826
- Mmm.
- That's a really good list.

05:04.826 --> 05:07.611
Ryan Reynolds, Adam Levine,
Steph Curry,

05:07.611 --> 05:09.744
Chris Hemsworth,
Harry Styles.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.354
Wait, I thought
you only get five.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.442
Five from each side.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.314
- Standard bi perk.
- Oh.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.838
Ladies and gentleman, that is
how you do a list of strangers

05:16.838 --> 05:19.580
you want to sleep with.
Chloe, ladies and gentleman.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.760
You're so far away.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.066
- ...to be a part of?
- Oh, she's in it.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.984
All right, so it is "Char-lize."

05:32.984 --> 05:35.465
It is not. It's "Shar-lize."

05:35.465 --> 05:37.337
All right, "Shar-lize Ther-on."

05:37.337 --> 05:39.991
"Shar-lize Ther-own."
It's a very famous woman.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.602
No, I don't think that's right.

05:41.602 --> 05:45.214
- I think it's "Sharlize."
- I don't know what to tell you.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.477
Like "throne." "Therone."

05:47.477 --> 05:50.132
- Yes, "Therone."
- Is she the queen?

05:50.132 --> 05:51.481
I don't know what that means.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.222
- Hey, you gonna be OK?
- Yes.

05:53.222 --> 05:56.486
Yep, we'll take her home.
Girls' night must carry on.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.140
It's gonna be so much fun

05:58.140 --> 06:01.361
carrying you both up the flights
of stairs when we get there.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.363
Three flights of stairs.

06:04.755 --> 06:08.237
I do, I really do.
I believe you.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.718
All right, guys. I'm gonna
walk back. Congratulations.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.023
Good night, bro, thanks.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.285
- Bye.
- Thanks very much.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.765
- Ouch.
Oh.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.942
- Bye, babe.
- Bye. Love ya.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.597
- Bye, ladies.
Bye.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.208
All right. You in? OK, bye.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.697
Oh, shit, sorry.

06:33.697 --> 06:36.396
Uh, no, it's OK, you take it.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.749
Where you headed?

08:36.602 --> 08:37.952
Ooh!

08:37.952 --> 08:40.607
OK, just a teensy bit higher.

08:40.607 --> 08:44.174
Just a...
No, no, no, just a little lower.

08:44.174 --> 08:47.657
Yes. Yes.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.486
- It's back in the same spot.
- It's perfect.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.750
I'm gonna go check
on those cake balls.

08:53.750 --> 08:57.885
Oh. No. Chelsea.
No, that's for later.

08:57.885 --> 09:01.105
- It <i>is</i> later.
- Look, I know Abby's late,

09:01.105 --> 09:03.891
but we're all just gonna
wait for her before we dig in.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.850
Mmm, sorry, no.
Five-second rule.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.373
That's not what that means.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.560
Really good.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.781
OK.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.400
And if we keep up our energy,

09:35.400 --> 09:38.229
our focus, our drive,

09:38.229 --> 09:43.017
then together, we will build
something truly special,

09:43.017 --> 09:45.628
here in our beloved New York.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.369
Thank you.

09:47.369 --> 09:48.979
- Thank you, everybody.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.722
Mayor Capozzi.
I had some thoughts

09:52.722 --> 09:54.463
on your global warming speech.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.943
That's not for three months, Abby.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.248
Trying to get a head start.

09:57.248 --> 10:00.338
- Isn't your bridal shower today?
- Yes.

10:00.338 --> 10:04.038
But that doesn't start for...
ten minutes ago. Shit.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.518
Not to worry,
I've got you covered.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.607
Thank you, sir.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.434
C Train should get you there
in no time.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.615
Good luck, Abby.

10:18.966 --> 10:23.231
- She's working, isn't she?
- Working? Uh, but... No, no.

10:23.231 --> 10:27.931
Uh, she is... she's actually
getting a blow-out.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.890
Chloe, we both know my daughter

10:29.890 --> 10:32.283
doesn't take time
to blow anything.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.372
- Uh, what?
- Hi.

10:34.372 --> 10:38.942
I don't mean to cause alarm,
but the gelato is melting.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.683
You mean the ice cream?

10:40.683 --> 10:45.514
Yes. It's like ice cream,
but it's, um, from Italy, so...

10:45.514 --> 10:47.908
Can't we just put it back
in the freezer?

10:47.908 --> 10:52.869
Yes, perfect. Or we could
use the back-up gelato.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.828
Hmm!

10:54.828 --> 10:57.004
There's back-up gelato? I...

10:57.004 --> 10:58.962
- Oh, my God.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.398
Abby, where the hell are you?

11:00.398 --> 11:01.617
We're on the back-up gelato,

11:01.617 --> 11:03.271
Chelsea keeps eating
all the cake...

11:03.271 --> 11:06.361
- Who's Chelsea?
- I thought you invited her.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.973
Oh, OK. Let's go.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.769
Hi, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming,

11:22.769 --> 11:26.468
and for celebrating
with the bride-to-be, Abby.

11:26.468 --> 11:30.298
We have a little surprise.
Before Matt gets here,

11:30.298 --> 11:34.084
he wanted to share some of
his favorite moments with Abby.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.826
And because he wants everyone
to see, he, uh,

11:36.826 --> 11:40.787
just posted
a little trip down memory lane.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.529
<i>Hi, everyone. Hi, babe.</i>

11:44.529 --> 11:47.010
<i>Uh, before Abby and I
walk down the aisle,</i>

11:47.010 --> 11:50.231
<i>I thought it would be fun
to retrace the steps</i>

11:50.231 --> 11:52.189
<i>that led us here to this moment.</i>

11:52.189 --> 11:55.453
<i>And it all started here,
in Washington Square Park...</i>

11:56.803 --> 11:57.978
<i>...where Abby and I
had our first kiss</i>

11:57.978 --> 11:59.501
<i>while she was still
in law school.</i>

12:00.545 --> 12:02.243
<i>And this is our bar.</i>

12:02.243 --> 12:06.029
<i>Our Thursday night spot
where everybody knows our name.</i>

12:06.029 --> 12:08.510
<i>Hey, dipshit, you gonna order?</i>

12:08.510 --> 12:10.251
<i>He's talking to somebody else.</i>

12:12.819 --> 12:14.211
<i>This is where I asked Abby</i>

12:14.211 --> 12:16.605
<i>to make me the happiest man
in the world.</i>

12:16.605 --> 12:19.739
<i>Figured if she said no,
I could just... jump off.</i>

12:22.524 --> 12:25.788
Oh, he, uh, he's going live.
This is unexpected.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.660
<i>You are seriously
the luckiest guy I know.</i>

12:28.660 --> 12:29.966
Yeah, she is pretty perfect.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.881
She's not pretty perfect,
she <i>is</i> perfect.

12:31.881 --> 12:35.232
<i>She is perfect. She is a ten.
You're like a three, at best.</i>

12:35.232 --> 12:36.843
<i>Maybe a four
with a good filter.</i>

12:36.843 --> 12:38.366
<i>All right. Thank you.</i>

12:38.366 --> 12:39.802
<i>She's a "swipe right,"
you're a "swipe left,"</i>

12:39.802 --> 12:41.804
<i>and then again
to make sure it takes,</i>

12:41.804 --> 12:43.937
<i>and then throw your phone
in the river</i>

12:43.937 --> 12:45.852
<i>and burn it to make sure
it doesn't work.</i>

12:45.852 --> 12:48.202
<i>OK. I'm sensing
a little jealousy here.</i>

12:48.202 --> 12:49.769
I don't know too many people

12:49.769 --> 12:51.814
that get to be with someone
so, I don't know, famous.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.511
<i>Still seems crazy
to me too.</i>

12:53.511 --> 12:56.166
<i>You definitely checked
the best name off your list.</i>

12:56.166 --> 12:57.777
<i>I mean, she's like a movie star</i>

12:57.777 --> 12:59.996
<i>and not just any movie star
but</i> the <i>movie star.</i>

12:59.996 --> 13:04.087
<i>- I'm the one who saw her first.</i>
- This is not working! Shit!

13:04.087 --> 13:07.656
Come on. Seriously, man.
I cannot believe that you...

13:07.656 --> 13:10.267
- Fucked Kenzie Scott!

13:25.500 --> 13:27.371
Uh...

13:33.116 --> 13:34.422
I can't believe you.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.902
We're supposed to get married
in three weeks.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.642
- Can we not do this here?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.166
Let me know
a more appropriate venue

13:39.166 --> 13:40.907
to discuss
you fucking Kenzie Scott.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.734
You were not supposed
to find out this way.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.301
Was Kenzie Scott
going to jump out

13:44.301 --> 13:45.825
of my wedding cake
and tell me?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.174
Matt, there you are. Hi.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.697
I know you were excited
about the cake balls.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.220
Did they bring them out on time?

13:50.220 --> 13:51.656
Why don't you ask Kenzie Scott?

13:51.656 --> 13:54.181
Sounds like she's been handling
the balls lately.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.619
Matt, were your balls
handled OK?

13:59.969 --> 14:01.841
OK.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.931
Abby, listen to me,
it was just a one-time thing.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.454
Was this that night at the bar?

14:06.454 --> 14:08.238
The fucking night
we got engaged.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.284
I thought it was OK
because she was on my list.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.633
Matt, we made those lists

14:11.633 --> 14:13.417
when we were drunk
celebrating with friends,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.767
and five minutes later
you're crossing off names?

14:15.767 --> 14:18.379
If it was reversed, you wouldn't
have done the same thing?

14:18.379 --> 14:22.731
No! No! Because I would never
do something like that to you.

14:22.731 --> 14:26.039
- Well, maybe you should.
- What?

14:26.039 --> 14:28.650
Maybe you should sleep
with a celebrity too.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.958
- And then we both did it.
- Both did it?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.221
This isn't like
getting matching tattoos.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.875
Wait, where are you going?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.789
- I can't do this right now.
- Will you please come inside?

14:37.789 --> 14:41.184
Is that a question
or a request from Kenzie Scott?

15:04.512 --> 15:07.210
Abby. You got a sec?

15:14.130 --> 15:17.612
- Come in, sit.
- Hello, sir.

15:17.612 --> 15:21.442
So, you've been working
on this speech for three days.

15:21.442 --> 15:24.140
Yes, sir.
I put some real sweat into that.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.491
Yes, I noticed the ink smudges.

15:28.449 --> 15:32.061
- And is this blood on page four?
- Oh, no, that's ketchup.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.149
Wait, page four?

15:33.149 --> 15:35.935
- Yeah, that's blood.
- Yeah.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.329
Abby, I don't know
the best way to say this,

15:39.329 --> 15:40.809
so I'm just going to say it.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.639
This is the worst thing I've
ever read in my entire life.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.772
- Oh, boy.
- The rhetoric is contentious.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.949
You typed half of it in caps.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.431
And you used the phrase,
"End of the world as we know it"

15:54.431 --> 15:57.913
four times. No, five.

15:57.913 --> 16:01.090
I was, uh, really trying
to hammer home

16:01.090 --> 16:03.136
the gravity of the speech.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.226
I'm delivering this
at a pre-school.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.358
I'll get started
on a new draft.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.838
Yeah, about that.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.015
I haven't told many people
this yet, but...

16:13.015 --> 16:15.757
I'm about to announce
my bid for president.

16:16.845 --> 16:20.980
- Sir, that's... that's amazing.
- Yes, it is. For me.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.113
Abby.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.420
You've written every word

16:26.420 --> 16:29.162
I've spoken in public
for the past two years.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.772
And I think I know you
well enough

16:30.772 --> 16:32.817
to know
when something's not right.

16:33.209 --> 16:36.038
And with campaign season
right around the corner,

16:36.604 --> 16:38.258
everything has to be.

16:39.476 --> 16:42.784
So, my campaign manager
is bringing in Avery Gordon.

16:42.784 --> 16:46.266
- Avery Gordon. That's amazing.
- Yes.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.051
Again, for me.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.142
Sir, are you firing me?

16:53.142 --> 16:55.231
Well, technically,
Cindy from HR will do that,

16:55.231 --> 16:58.104
but, yeah, I'm letting you go.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.629
Take care of your personal life, Abby.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.196
The writing will come back.

17:03.674 --> 17:07.852
Oh... So, so that's it then?

17:07.852 --> 17:09.810
Well, there's quite a bit
of paperwork

17:09.810 --> 17:11.595
you'll need
to fill out, but yeah.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.205
Right.

17:13.205 --> 17:15.946
Oh, and, Abby,
one more thing before you go.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.689
Shred this for me, will you?

17:18.689 --> 17:22.693
Run it twice through.
We can't risk it getting Argoed.

17:22.693 --> 17:24.130
That would be bad.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.522
Yes. For you.

17:31.615 --> 17:36.185
My life is over. I've wanted
this job for 20 years.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.710
You wanted to be a speech writer
since you were seven?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.321
Now it's gone.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.280
All because my fiancé slept
with Kenzie fucking Scott.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.936
Hey, you're gonna
get through this, OK?

17:47.936 --> 17:50.199
We just gotta figure out
what the next step is.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.288
I was thinking that too,

17:52.288 --> 17:54.638
so I started coming up
with a new list.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.815
- OK, good.
- Grease fire. Pool of acid.

17:57.815 --> 18:01.471
- Wood chipper...
-"Ways Matt should die?"

18:01.471 --> 18:02.559
How is this productive?

18:02.559 --> 18:04.083
There's some good ideas
on there.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.173
"Trial by combat
with The Mountain?"

18:07.173 --> 18:09.000
This is not productive.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.787
Remember when Sam
broke up with me?

18:12.787 --> 18:16.095
I was hung up on her for weeks.
But I got over it.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.271
You still masturbate
to her porn doppelgaänger.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.882
And it's been really helpful
with the grieving process.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.624
Leave the bottle. People
don't do that in real life.

18:27.323 --> 18:28.890
You know what?

18:28.890 --> 18:31.675
Maybe you just need to get away
for a little while.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.025
How about you come stay with me
in LA?

18:34.025 --> 18:36.941
I can't go to LA. I'm getting
married in three weeks.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.118
Are we still doing that?

18:40.641 --> 18:44.906
I don't know. We just
have so much history together.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.605
I guess I'm just not ready
to call off the wedding.

18:48.605 --> 18:52.043
Then don't,
and come stay with me.

18:52.522 --> 18:56.135
I mean, what better way to clear
your mind and figure things out?

18:56.657 --> 18:59.355
Besides, when was the last time
you even took a vacation?

18:59.355 --> 19:02.141
Chloe, I had a job.
I couldn't just tell my boss

19:02.141 --> 19:04.491
"Hey, I'm taking time off
to unwind and relax.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.710
Hope my job's there
when I get back."

19:06.710 --> 19:09.235
That is literally
what a vacation is.

19:09.496 --> 19:10.932
Oh.

19:11.324 --> 19:16.155
Abby, I think this
could be really good for you.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.200
You're doing this.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.031
- OK, fine.
- Yes!

19:23.031 --> 19:25.555
Wow. I didn't think
that was gonna work.

19:25.555 --> 19:26.730
- Great.
- Whoo!

19:50.406 --> 19:53.366
<i>Abby, it's Matt again.
I'm so sorry.</i>

19:53.366 --> 19:55.803
<i>Please, I just need
to hear your voice.</i>

20:00.460 --> 20:04.115
Al fresco. You can't really do
that year-round in New York.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.030
Perfect weather...

20:06.901 --> 20:11.035
A plant wall. I'm already
getting positive vibes here.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.910
Hey. Everything OK?

20:16.476 --> 20:18.217
Soup's cold.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.959
It's gazpacho.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.005
Well, then it's too hot.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.790
Come on, Abby.

20:26.790 --> 20:27.878
I promise this trip

20:28.314 --> 20:30.664
will help you clear your mind
if you just let it.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.711
In fact, this is
gonna be our spot.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.193
You and I are coming here
every day.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.769
You know what? This place sucks.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.858
- Maybe we should just...
- No, it's totally fine.

20:50.858 --> 20:53.730
It's not like the billboard
fucked my fiancé.

20:58.169 --> 21:02.304
You really... She doesn't
eat carbs. Sorry, guys, sorry.

21:02.304 --> 21:05.655
- Can we get some more bread?
- OK, let's go.

21:06.874 --> 21:08.745
We'll pay for that.

21:10.486 --> 21:14.490
Indoor dining.
This is where it's at.

21:14.490 --> 21:19.626
More intimate, no large signage,
the acoustics are predictable.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.326
- Are you sure you're OK?

21:24.326 --> 21:26.502
Wait, did you take another
one of those pills

21:26.502 --> 21:28.287
I gave you on the plane?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.420
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm way OK.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.422
- Uh...
- It's fine.

21:33.422 --> 21:37.078
Oh, OK, um, we are gonna go.
We're gonna go home.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.993
- Shh.
- Oh.

21:38.993 --> 21:42.083
OK, we are going now. Let's go.

21:43.998 --> 21:47.784
Psst. It's Nick Viall.

21:47.784 --> 21:51.701
Great. The guy from
<i>The Bachelor.</i> Can we please go?

21:51.701 --> 21:53.137
Maybe Matt's right.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.705
Maybe I should sleep
with a celebrity on my list.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.099
Why are you talking
to a complete stranger?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.276
What would you even say to him?

22:01.276 --> 22:03.147
I'm a speech writer.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.370
Sorry, was that
the entire answer?

22:08.370 --> 22:10.764
I happen to be a ninja
with words.

22:10.764 --> 22:14.594
Abby, you write speeches
about curbing carbon emissions.

22:14.594 --> 22:17.684
The only guy that gets turned on
by that is Al Gore,

22:17.684 --> 22:19.468
not the guy from <i>The Bachelor.</i>

22:19.468 --> 22:21.165
Hey, are you guys
ready to order?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.602
Excuse me, sir,

22:22.602 --> 22:25.126
do you see that fine gentleman
just over yonder?

22:25.126 --> 22:27.737
- She's British?
- You mean Nick Viall?

22:27.737 --> 22:31.045
- Do you think I have a shot?
- A shot at what?

22:31.045 --> 22:33.134
You know...

22:33.134 --> 22:37.138
- Oh. Oh, uh... Oh.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.748
- Sexual intercourse.
- Yeah.

22:38.748 --> 22:43.187
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Celebrities
are just like normal people.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.146
Cool.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.061
We're just gonna need a minute
to go over...

22:47.061 --> 22:48.715
- Oh.
- ...her life choices.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.847
- Yeah, take your time.
- Thanks.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.762
- Chloe, this is happening.
- Oh, God.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.764
I have three weeks
before my wedding,

22:54.764 --> 22:57.245
I'm gonna sleep
with a celebrity from my list.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.203
That is a super-weird thing
to say.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.553
- Here I go.
- Oh.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.729
- Ooh.
- OK.

23:04.600 --> 23:09.344
Please don't grab a flower.
Please don't grab a flower.

23:09.344 --> 23:12.478
- Excuse me.
- And she grabbed the flower.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.440
- Nick.
- Oh, boy.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.963
Will you accept this rose?

23:20.790 --> 23:22.444
That's a daisy.

23:22.444 --> 23:26.579
- You're so funny.
- Well, I know my flowers.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.233
Well, I just wanted
to come over here

23:29.233 --> 23:30.931
and let you know that...

23:31.453 --> 23:34.456
you are on my list.

23:34.978 --> 23:38.373
- Your what now?
- You know, my free-pass list.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.983
Like we could...

23:41.550 --> 23:45.162
Oh, your list.
Wow, this is really happening.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.556
Um, I don't mean to be rude.

23:48.296 --> 23:52.518
But thanks but no, thanks.
I'm kinda off the market.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.998
See, that's the great thing
about the list.

23:54.998 --> 23:58.045
- Hm-hmm.
- Nobody gets in trouble.

23:58.045 --> 24:00.047
I really don't want to know
what that means.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.875
It means I'm here
for the right reasons.

24:01.875 --> 24:02.963
OK.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.791
- And the wrong ones.
- OK, um...

24:05.705 --> 24:08.447
I think this might actually
be working.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.884
I told you. They're just
like everybody else.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.277
Wouldn't you have to be
on my list too?

24:13.539 --> 24:15.149
Are you saying I'm on your list?

24:15.149 --> 24:18.152
- I'm saying you're on a list.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.459
Except for her.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.070
That is Nick's girlfriend and
she is not like everybody else.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.898
- Hon.
- What's going on here?

24:24.898 --> 24:26.726
- Hey. This is, uh...
- Looks like fun.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.903
- Abby!
- Her? What do you mean?

24:29.903 --> 24:32.471
That's Leyna Stone. She once
stabbed a waiter with a fork

24:32.471 --> 24:34.690
because she didn't like the way
he poured her water.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.214
- Come on, that can't be true.
- Oh, yeah? It can't be true?

24:37.214 --> 24:41.436
- Look at this.
- Oh, shit!

24:41.436 --> 24:45.222
Abby was just trying
to sell me candy.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.442
Uh, no, I was trying
to screw you.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.226
Yeah, you were.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.054
- Ten dollars for M
- OK.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.316
I'll melt in your hand

24:52.316 --> 24:53.492
- and your mouth.
- OK.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.581
- Hmm.
- And I'm done covering for you.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.061
All right, are you seriously
trying to sleep with my man?

24:59.715 --> 25:02.022
Ah, well, they don't call me
"Downtown Abby" for nothing.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.677
- I thought it was "Downton".
- Let's go to the fantasy suite.

25:04.677 --> 25:07.027
All right. Can somebody
get me a fork please?

25:07.027 --> 25:09.029
- I'm going in.
- Yeah.

25:09.029 --> 25:12.423
Leyna. Nick. Hi.
Real big fan of your journey.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.426
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm just
gonna steal her away for a sec.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.559
- Thank you so much.
- Just a second.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.691
What are you doing?

25:18.691 --> 25:20.301
I was about to seal
the deal here.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.650
- You're embarrassing yourself.
- I'm embarrassing myself?

25:21.650 --> 25:23.173
You know what? That's it.
I've seen enough.

25:23.173 --> 25:26.525
I think I should
give you guys some... Oh!

25:26.525 --> 25:29.615
- I am so sorry.
Oh, my God.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.356
I wouldn't worry. It's just
water, it'll come right out.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.445
- It's not even on me.
- It's on me.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.751
It's on me, babe. Come on.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.927
Eye contact.
We talked about this in therapy.

25:37.927 --> 25:39.842
- I love you.
- OK.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.932
You look great.

25:42.932 --> 25:45.195
Real ninja
with those words there.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.809
Hey. I think you guys left this.

25:49.809 --> 25:52.899
- Um, that's not ours.
- It's not?

25:52.899 --> 25:55.728
Shit. I think I just stole
Leyna Stone's purse.

25:55.728 --> 25:58.034
I'm sure
Leyna has plenty of purses.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.862
Oh, yeah. Is she gonna be OK?

25:59.862 --> 26:01.647
Yeah, she's fine.
We owe you one.

26:01.647 --> 26:05.520
Well, for what it's worth,
I did think you had a shot.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.088
Thanks.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.960
- I should go back in there.
- No!

26:10.960 --> 26:12.179
God, no.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.661
- It's OK. That way.
- Thank you so much.

26:20.187 --> 26:21.841
OK.

26:27.934 --> 26:31.459
<i>Hi! Let's just go over
the changes you emailed me, OK?</i>

26:31.459 --> 26:34.375
<i>Um, so you want to incorporate
some darker hues.</i>

26:34.375 --> 26:35.942
<i>Shouldn't be a problem.</i>

26:35.942 --> 26:39.554
<i>You want straight vodka
for the champagne toast.</i>

26:39.554 --> 26:41.512
<i>I like your style, girl.</i>

26:41.512 --> 26:43.297
<i>And then you want
to walk down the aisle</i>

26:43.297 --> 26:46.648
<i>to Taylor Swift's "We Are Never
Getting Back Together".</i>

26:46.648 --> 26:48.955
- Ever.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

26:48.955 --> 26:51.522
"We Are Never Ever
Getting Back Together."

26:51.522 --> 26:55.701
<i>Oh, of course. Yeah, of course.
"Never Ever." Got it.</i>

26:55.701 --> 26:57.354
Hi. She's gonna call you
right back.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.792
You're doing a great job.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

26:59.792 --> 27:03.012
<i>- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.</i>
- I love the gardenias. OK, bye.

27:03.012 --> 27:07.190
Hey, no more drunk emailing
the wedding planner.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.411
- I can't help it, Chloe.
<i>...for you this morning.</i>

27:10.411 --> 27:14.894
<i>Kenzie Scott is in the studio.</i>

27:14.894 --> 27:18.767
<i>So, everyone's talking
about that cave scene.</i>

27:18.767 --> 27:20.160
<i>Hm-hmm, yep.</i>

27:20.160 --> 27:21.727
<i>- It's not for the squeamish.</i>
- Shit.

27:21.727 --> 27:24.164
- No.
<i>Which includes me.</i>

27:24.164 --> 27:26.166
<i>You know, I get light-headed
from a paper cut.</i>

27:26.166 --> 27:28.472
<i>Oh, let's just
move these away then.</i>

27:31.127 --> 27:36.219
<i>- So, I hear you're single now.
- Hm-hmm.</i>

27:36.219 --> 27:40.136
<i>And we all want to know,
what's Kenzie Scott's type?</i>

27:40.136 --> 27:44.880
<i>Oh, well, I wouldn't say
I have a type.</i>

27:44.880 --> 27:50.059
<i>I do usually go for,
you know, tall, athletic...</i>

27:50.059 --> 27:55.325
<i>Gotta have a sense of humor.
Am I right? Oh, and, um...</i>

27:57.197 --> 28:02.681
<i>I love it when a guy
is in a relationship.</i>

28:02.681 --> 28:06.380
<i>Especially if he's engaged.</i>

28:06.380 --> 28:11.864
<i>There is just nothing hotter
than sleeping with a guy</i>

28:11.864 --> 28:16.085
<i>whose fiancé
is totally clueless.</i>

28:16.085 --> 28:19.872
<i>Oh, and the best part
is when she finds out</i>

28:19.872 --> 28:23.266
<i>at her own bridal shower.</i>

28:27.575 --> 28:28.750
<i>Right, Abby?</i>

28:30.796 --> 28:33.146
<i>- Huh.</i>
Abby...

28:33.146 --> 28:35.496
Abby. Abby!

28:36.584 --> 28:38.368
Are we good on the self-torture?

28:38.368 --> 28:40.066
<i>Am I right?</i>

28:40.066 --> 28:42.895
Do you really think
I had a chance with Nick Viall?

28:43.765 --> 28:45.593
Uh, sure.

28:45.593 --> 28:49.597
In some alternate universe where
you don't OD on sleeping pills

28:49.597 --> 28:53.383
and Leyna Stone
doesn't try to kill you. Why?

28:53.383 --> 28:56.865
Well, everything's always been
about either my job or Matt.

28:56.865 --> 28:59.868
Maybe it's time I finally
do something for myself.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.610
What are you saying?

29:02.610 --> 29:04.743
I have four names
left on this list.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.570
If I'm going to sleep
with a celebrity,

29:06.570 --> 29:08.747
we better get started.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.880
This just got sexy.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.621
- Ooh!
Oh, yeah.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.931
OK, first things first.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.759
As hard as it is
to become a celebrity,

29:20.759 --> 29:22.543
it's even harder
to sleep with one.

29:22.543 --> 29:23.892
Right.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.548
The point is,
we need a damn good plan.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.812
I'm talking Navy Seals storming
the Bin Laden compound.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.728
This has to be surgical.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.252
Yes. If only we knew
someone in LA

29:36.252 --> 29:38.733
who gets paid
to work with A-list celebrities.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.779
We are not calling Sam.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.345
Your ex-girlfriend
is a talent agent.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.912
We're trying to sleep
with talent.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.132
We don't need help.

29:46.132 --> 29:49.135
Did Luke Skywalker need help
to blow up the Death Star?

29:49.135 --> 29:52.878
Yes. From Han Solo
and, like, 30 X-wing fighters.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.053
Not to mention the old guy

29:54.053 --> 29:55.619
who basically told him
when to shoot.

29:55.619 --> 29:59.754
OK, just... Just trust me, OK?

29:59.754 --> 30:02.583
Remind me.
Who else is on your list?

30:02.583 --> 30:03.845
Mac West.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.325
<i>Action star Mac West</i>

30:05.325 --> 30:07.544
<i>is blowing up the box office
yet again</i>

30:07.544 --> 30:10.809
<i>with his new flick
"I'm Dead When I Say I'm Dead".</i>

30:10.983 --> 30:13.594
Just know,
I'm out here getting it done.

30:15.030 --> 30:17.685
Was that thunder?
Y'all heard that?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.556
Cooper Grant.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.297
<i>Sexiest Man on Earth
Cooper Grant</i>

30:21.297 --> 30:23.560
<i>was spotted
on the red carpet last night</i>

30:23.560 --> 30:25.301
<i>sans his sidekick Ari Miller,</i>

30:25.301 --> 30:28.174
<i>sparking rumors of a rift
between these two best buddies.</i>

30:28.174 --> 30:30.524
Avon.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
<i>Emo rapper Avon
is on the top of the charts</i>

30:32.700 --> 30:34.571
<i>and taking out the trash</i>

30:34.571 --> 30:38.358
<i>with his sleeper hit
"Stare You Down To Doggtown".</i>

30:39.881 --> 30:42.449
And of course, Oscar Isaac.

30:43.754 --> 30:46.757
Abby, we need someone
more attainable.

30:46.757 --> 30:50.544
Uh, well,
there's always Jack Black.

30:50.544 --> 30:51.675
Still vetoed.

30:55.766 --> 30:59.683
We're gonna need more coffee.
This is gonna be a long night.

31:07.474 --> 31:08.867
Hm-hmm.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.560
I find it kinda weird you had
all this yarn in your apartment.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.751
What... What are you doing?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.580
It's six a.m.

32:11.451 --> 32:12.800
Check it out.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.282
That is Oscar Isaac
on his #weeklyspinclass.

32:16.282 --> 32:19.589
So, if you want to get "Inside
Llewyn Davis", we gotta move.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.029
OK.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.772
I don't see him.
What exactly is the plan?

32:28.772 --> 32:31.297
It's fine. We have
six other studios to try.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.602
If he doesn't show up,

32:32.602 --> 32:34.778
we'll just sneak out
before the class starts.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.825
Go ahead
and claim a bike, girls.

32:38.695 --> 32:42.221
- Actually, we were just leaving.
- Sure you were.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.747
Come on, ladies, hop on.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.144
Girls, I have never had
a quitter in my class

32:52.144 --> 32:53.841
and I'm not about
to start today.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.453
All right, everybody...

32:58.193 --> 33:00.761
it's time to grind.

33:00.761 --> 33:01.980
Sorry.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.465
How do you get your feet in?

33:18.866 --> 33:20.346
Let's push it.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.652
Only 40 minutes left.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.525
Forty minutes?
Are we time traveling?

33:25.525 --> 33:27.744
That's 40 opportunities

33:27.744 --> 33:31.052
to do better than
the loser you are right now.

33:31.052 --> 33:35.317
We're not moving. We're just
here. We're never leaving.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.840
Mommy!

33:36.840 --> 33:39.843
You're the hill.
You're the hill.

33:39.843 --> 33:42.020
And climb. And climb.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.413
- Time.
- Oh.

33:44.413 --> 33:47.590
Oh, God. OK.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.593
- Come on.
- What? Why are you stopping?

33:50.593 --> 33:52.987
Next class starts
in five minutes.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.771
Oh, legs weren't ready.

34:11.484 --> 34:13.616
Press in. Press in!

34:13.616 --> 34:15.053
You're not pressing in.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.231
Wake up!

34:19.231 --> 34:21.059
You're a bad, bad man.

34:23.364 --> 34:26.716
If you chose
easy, you chose the wrong door.

34:42.949 --> 34:45.344
Glad to see you girls
are back for round two.

34:45.344 --> 34:48.085
Uh-uh. What did I say
about quitters?

34:48.085 --> 34:49.826
Hey. My favorite customers.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.697
Hey.

34:51.697 --> 34:53.960
I didn't really peg you guys
as the spinning types.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.833
Are you kidding?
This is our fifth class today.

34:57.312 --> 34:58.574
We love health.

34:58.574 --> 35:01.055
Nice. I try and take this class
every week.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.536
- But it's hard to get a bike.
- Why's that?

35:03.536 --> 35:06.321
Oscar Isaac
joins this class sometimes.

35:06.321 --> 35:09.368
But he's not here this week
so... lucky you.

35:12.893 --> 35:16.157
Yeah. Lucky us.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.509
All right, everyone. Mount up.

35:22.729 --> 35:25.514
Lucky number five.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.081
- Oh, OK.
- OK.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.955
- Yay.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.573
Your feet
aren't even in the pedals.

35:40.573 --> 35:43.141
You're literally
not moving your legs.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.582
And time.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.673
Great job, Jake.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.765
I think you guy's bike
was broken.

35:58.765 --> 36:00.767
It says you only moved 40 feet.

36:03.552 --> 36:04.945
Oh, shoot.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.470
Hey, do you still owe me one?

36:08.470 --> 36:12.300
Oh, I can't, I'm sorry.
I have to go ice my vagina.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.608
- But maybe she can.
- Well...

36:15.608 --> 36:17.000
My friend
was supposed to help me

36:17.000 --> 36:18.219
with some photography work

36:18.219 --> 36:19.829
but he just canceled.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.311
What exactly
do you need me to do?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.232
You're up, New York.
Let's see what you got.

36:31.232 --> 36:34.409
All right, folks, can I have
everyone take a few steps back?

36:34.409 --> 36:37.934
We need to clear this one area.
Thank you.

36:45.159 --> 36:46.769
Excuse me, ma'am?

36:46.943 --> 36:49.903
Is this the part of the tour
where we can ask questions?

36:49.903 --> 36:51.252
Uh, what?

36:51.252 --> 36:53.950
Who was the first star
on the Walk of Fame?

36:54.516 --> 36:59.304
Great question. That would be
Marilyn Monroe in 1957.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.349
Part of Hollywood's celebration

37:01.349 --> 37:04.309
of strong female leads
in American cinema.

37:04.309 --> 37:07.355
Says here
it was director Stanley Kramer.

37:07.355 --> 37:10.097
- Where'd you get that thing?
- All right, I think I got it.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.665
All right, folks.
Uh, thank you for your patience.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.755
Feel free to walk around,
take in the sights.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.061
And you might want
to return that guidebook.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.940
So you let some air in,
cork the bottle,

37:26.940 --> 37:28.768
and then give it as a souvenir?

37:28.768 --> 37:30.726
Yeah, that's what
the pictures are for.

37:30.726 --> 37:34.034
- So, you're selling air?
- No, I'm selling a novelty.

37:34.034 --> 37:36.210
- Made of air.
- OK, listen.

37:36.210 --> 37:39.039
People are always rushing
from place to place.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.823
Sight Sealing
forces you to stop,

37:40.823 --> 37:42.999
literally take
in the air around you,

37:42.999 --> 37:44.523
and you can preserve the moments

37:44.523 --> 37:46.394
that you want
to hold on to forever.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.440
You've rehearsed that before,
haven't you?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.877
Like, a thousand times.
How'd it sound?

37:50.877 --> 37:52.400
Impressive.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.620
Good. I've been using it
at all of my pitch meetings.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.709
Wow. Any luck?

37:56.709 --> 37:58.101
They want to launch in New York,

37:58.101 --> 38:00.103
but it turns out
there's all this red tape

38:00.103 --> 38:01.583
for using images of landmarks.

38:01.583 --> 38:05.631
Yeah, they can be pretty strict
about that.

38:05.631 --> 38:10.288
OK, so I gotta ask, the thing
at the café the other day...

38:11.419 --> 38:13.595
My fiancé
slept with Kenzie Scott.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.728
Kenzie...
The actress Kenzie Scott?

38:15.728 --> 38:17.338
She was on his free-pass list.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.645
And apparently he took it
more seriously than I expected.

38:19.645 --> 38:22.778
And so now you want to get
with someone on your list?

38:22.778 --> 38:25.781
When you say it like that...

38:25.781 --> 38:27.740
I just think
when your heart's broken,

38:27.740 --> 38:29.698
you'll try anything
to make it whole.

38:29.698 --> 38:33.441
Oh, no, yeah, no, I get it.
My first love broke my heart.

38:33.441 --> 38:36.096
- Oh.
- I'll never forget it.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.054
- I was in third grade.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.665
I'm serious. Cheryl Conley.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.928
We were supposed to meet me
by the slide during recess.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.973
I searched the entire playground
for her.

38:43.973 --> 38:48.282
And I found her holding Jared
Kay's hands on the swing set.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.240
I haven't been
on a swing set since.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.590
That is tragic.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.723
So, uh, who else
is on your list?

38:54.723 --> 38:56.508
I'm not going through
my list with you.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.727
Why not? We could go back
to Hollywood Boulevard.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.381
- You could practice

39:00.381 --> 39:03.253
on a celebrity impersonator.
I could be your wingman.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.081
- Hey, Chloe.
- Hey. OK.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.648
So, I did some research

39:06.648 --> 39:08.650
and it turns out Cooper Grant
is huge into CrossFit...

39:08.650 --> 39:12.393
Chloe, Chloe, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, I just...

39:12.393 --> 39:16.354
- I don't think it's working.
- Yeah, you're right.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.922
Back to the drawing board.
I'll pick up some more yarn.

39:19.922 --> 39:22.316
Actually, I made
an executive decision

39:22.316 --> 39:24.753
and called in
some reinforcements.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.582
No, you didn't.

39:29.323 --> 39:32.195
No, no, no, no, no.

39:33.632 --> 39:36.330
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

39:36.330 --> 39:38.550
I'm just gonna send this email
really quick.

39:42.858 --> 39:45.383
Don't rush me, don't rush me.
Hold on.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.822
All right, just one second,
one second.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.693
Just gotta send this email.

39:51.693 --> 39:56.002
OK. What exactly
do you guys need my help with?

39:56.002 --> 40:00.746
Oh. First of all,
we don't <i>need</i> your help.

40:00.746 --> 40:04.532
We are perfectly capable,
strong, independent women

40:04.532 --> 40:06.708
and I'm doing just fine
on my own.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.884
Are we still talking
about my thing?

40:08.884 --> 40:10.712
Yeah, let's do you first.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.845
Right. OK, so you know
how we made

40:12.845 --> 40:14.499
those celebrity
free-pass lists?

40:14.499 --> 40:17.676
- Well, Matt slept with his.
- Like, under his pillow?

40:17.676 --> 40:21.680
No, no, he didn't sleep
with his list.

40:21.680 --> 40:25.814
- He slept with Kenzie Scott.
- You're kidding.

40:25.814 --> 40:29.209
So now I need to sleep
with a celebrity on my list.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.994
That's so shallow.
I love this for you.

40:31.994 --> 40:33.648
And I need your help.

40:35.607 --> 40:38.566
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no.

40:38.566 --> 40:41.743
Sam, you're a talent agent.

40:41.743 --> 40:44.180
So you know how one
might get in the same room

40:44.180 --> 40:46.661
as, say, Cooper Grant.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.533
Cooper Grant?
Yes. Half the population

40:48.533 --> 40:49.751
is trying to sleep with him.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.927
The other half
is trying to fuck him.

40:51.927 --> 40:54.669
There are more achievable names
on the list.

40:54.669 --> 40:56.410
- Who?
- Don't say Jack Black.

40:57.106 --> 40:58.804
Mac West.

40:58.804 --> 41:01.197
I love you guys, but good luck. Bye.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.461
Make sure Rachel validates you.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.465
I told you she couldn't do it.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.642
Excuse me?

41:10.642 --> 41:13.209
Oh, uh, nothing.
I was just telling Abby

41:13.209 --> 41:16.474
that there's no way you can
get to someone on that list

41:16.474 --> 41:18.693
because you're not
powerful enough to do it.

41:18.693 --> 41:20.129
Hold on.

41:21.348 --> 41:22.654
I can get to these people.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.743
I can get inside these people
if I wanted to.

41:24.743 --> 41:28.442
- That's not the problem.
- So, what's the problem?

41:28.442 --> 41:30.357
The problem, Chloe, is

41:30.357 --> 41:33.229
I don't want to be an accessory
to celebrity stalking.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.275
OK. We're wasting
our time here.

41:35.275 --> 41:36.755
Wait. Wait, just wait.

41:36.755 --> 41:39.497
Everybody just relax.
Just take a breath.

41:45.198 --> 41:48.593
I happen to know Mac West
is in town filming a commercial.

41:51.117 --> 41:53.119
But you can't just walk
onto the set.

41:53.119 --> 41:58.080
OK. Why don't you make her,
like, a writer or something?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.647
Sure, Chloe,
I'll make her a writer.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.431
And tomorrow,
I'll have her producing,

42:01.431 --> 42:03.869
directing and starring
in the next Bond film.

42:03.869 --> 42:05.610
- We'd like that.
- Cool.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.437
Oh, my God. You're so adorable.

42:07.437 --> 42:09.178
The AD there
happens to owe me a favor.

42:09.178 --> 42:10.832
I can probably get you
on set as a PA.

42:10.832 --> 42:14.532
- Great. What's a PA?
- You'll love it.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.924
This is our tenth shoot together.

42:15.924 --> 42:17.447
You know
what I like to see.

42:17.447 --> 42:19.406
- I won't let you down.
- New girl, where's my coffee?

42:19.406 --> 42:20.581
In your hand.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.235
Patty, what hand
do I drink coffee with?

42:22.235 --> 42:23.541
- The left.
- Efficiency.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.543
If we waste time doing this,
we fail.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.979
Patty's the key PA on set.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.371
Follow her lead.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.853
Hey, I remember
my first day too.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.768
I've pretty much
done it all since then.

42:33.768 --> 42:36.118
I've been grip, key grip,
dolly grip.

42:36.118 --> 42:38.512
- Shit, I've even been grip grip.
- Grip grip?

42:38.512 --> 42:40.253
- I move the other grips around.
- Right.

42:40.253 --> 42:42.168
Stick with me, you'll be OK.

42:42.168 --> 42:45.737
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

42:47.042 --> 42:49.349
OK, now real talk,
you little punk.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.743
You obviously knew someone
or blew someone

42:51.743 --> 42:53.745
in order to land a PA job
last minute,

42:53.745 --> 42:55.703
but I haven't been doing this
for 20 years

42:55.703 --> 42:59.838
to be shown up by some
wannabe Greta Gerwig hot shot.

42:59.838 --> 43:04.843
Now, you stay out of my way or I
will sink you like the Titanic.

43:04.843 --> 43:06.105
Capisce?

43:06.453 --> 43:08.673
Can we start over?
My name's Abby. And I...

43:08.673 --> 43:12.415
Abby? I don't like that name.
I'm gonna call you Short Stack.

43:13.678 --> 43:15.549
Uh, I'm... I'm average height.

43:15.549 --> 43:19.248
Uh, yeah, yeah. Soaking wet.

43:19.248 --> 43:21.076
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

43:21.076 --> 43:23.122
Oh, what foot was that?
Four foot?

43:25.254 --> 43:26.778
Get to work, Frodo.

43:26.778 --> 43:27.996
Oh.

43:29.868 --> 43:32.131
I could dunk on her.

43:48.234 --> 43:51.280
I wanna be able
to eat off of it, Short Stack.

43:52.455 --> 43:54.370
Why would you wanna
eat off a wheel?

43:54.370 --> 43:56.198
- What was that?
- What?

43:56.198 --> 43:58.723
<i>Patty, I'm gonna need you
to get Mac to the set in five.</i>

43:58.723 --> 44:00.420
Copy that last transmission.

44:00.420 --> 44:03.292
Just need to deploy the wardrobe
and I will pick up Bald Eagle.

44:03.292 --> 44:04.642
Back to one.

44:08.210 --> 44:09.908
Who are these people?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.141
- Hey. Uh...
- Oh.

44:26.141 --> 44:27.708
Do you need a ride?

44:27.708 --> 44:29.318
Oh, I thought Patty
was driving me.

44:29.318 --> 44:32.931
Well, Mr. West,
there's a new Patty in town.

44:32.931 --> 44:35.455
Hm. Your name's also Patty?

44:35.455 --> 44:36.761
Uh, no. Well, I see

44:36.761 --> 44:39.459
how that actually
could've been confusing.

44:39.459 --> 44:42.157
I'm... I'm Abby, the other PA.

44:42.157 --> 44:43.681
Oh. Can I still call you Patty?

44:43.898 --> 44:46.684
- I don't think that's really...
- Thanks, Patty. You're a doll.

44:47.206 --> 44:49.861
OK. Um...

44:49.861 --> 44:52.733
You know, I have to say,
I'm a huge fan.

44:52.733 --> 44:55.301
I mean, when you jump
off of Pennington Tower

44:55.301 --> 44:56.476
just as it explodes

44:56.476 --> 44:57.999
and you're dangling
from the string.

44:57.999 --> 44:59.566
You've got this
huge firehouse...

44:59.566 --> 45:02.264
I do all my own stunts, Patty.

45:02.264 --> 45:04.049
Come on, I'll take you to set.

45:04.049 --> 45:06.834
- OK.

45:06.834 --> 45:08.140
Real Patty briefed you

45:08.140 --> 45:09.750
- on driving this thing, right?
Um...

45:09.750 --> 45:11.709
Whoa! Let's keep this
under a cool five.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.536
Uh, there's really
only one speed.

45:13.536 --> 45:15.843
Whoa, whoa! Speed bump,
speed bump, speed bump.

45:19.629 --> 45:21.719
Let's note that
for the ride back.

45:24.983 --> 45:27.072
This coffee tastes different.

45:27.072 --> 45:28.334
That'd be my special blend.

45:28.334 --> 45:30.205
A dash of cinnamon
with some hazelnut.

45:30.205 --> 45:31.554
Did you say hazelnut?

45:31.554 --> 45:32.817
You got that right.

45:32.817 --> 45:34.949
It's my gammy's special recipe, actually.

45:34.949 --> 45:36.864
Dash of cinnamon
with a little hazelnut.

45:36.864 --> 45:38.648
But it's really more like
a cup of...

45:38.648 --> 45:40.868
- I'm allergic to hazelnut.
- What?

45:40.868 --> 45:42.217
- Uh...

45:42.217 --> 45:44.002
- I think my throat is closing.
- What do we do?

45:44.002 --> 45:46.047
- Do you have an EpiPen?
- No, but I have a Bic one.

45:46.047 --> 45:49.268
- A what?
- A Bic one.

45:49.268 --> 45:50.704
- Trach me.
- Trach you?

45:50.704 --> 45:52.314
I'm not traching you!

45:52.314 --> 45:54.795
- Come on, Patty! My throat...
-  Oh, my God. OK.

45:54.795 --> 45:57.929
Oh, my God, this is happening!
One, two...

45:57.929 --> 45:59.757
- What the fuck are you doing?
- ...three!

45:59.757 --> 46:01.802
- Real Patty.
- I've got your EpiPen.

46:01.802 --> 46:03.761
- Assuming the position.

46:04.892 --> 46:07.199
I'm doubling up!

46:07.199 --> 46:11.464
- What is happening?

46:21.430 --> 46:24.782
Oh, Chloe.
Well...

46:24.782 --> 46:26.958
At least
it didn't mention your name.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.700
Is there a reason
why we're meeting Jake

46:30.700 --> 46:31.876
on some random
street?

46:31.876 --> 46:34.313
He said the food
is to die for.

46:39.753 --> 46:41.407
Whoa. OK...

46:41.407 --> 46:43.452
- Hey, guys.
-  God.

46:43.452 --> 46:44.845
So, Celso is gonna whip us up

46:44.845 --> 46:47.065
some of the best empanadas
you've ever had.

46:47.065 --> 46:49.502
- You ready?
- Oh! So sorry, Celso.

46:49.502 --> 46:51.591
Yeah, we didn't mean to assume.

46:51.591 --> 46:54.507
That's not Celso. We should go.

46:56.291 --> 46:58.728
- Yeah.
- I kind of peed a little.

46:58.728 --> 47:00.469
Oh, yeah.

47:01.166 --> 47:02.210
Mm. Mm.

47:02.210 --> 47:03.646
- Mm!
- Mm!

47:03.646 --> 47:04.952
Holy shit.

47:04.952 --> 47:06.084
Oh, yay!

47:07.694 --> 47:08.869
Mm.

47:12.090 --> 47:14.222
It's almost as good
as the street meat in New York.

47:14.222 --> 47:15.484
Yes.

47:15.484 --> 47:17.922
Did you just compare
LA's best empanada

47:17.922 --> 47:20.533
to something called street meat?

47:20.533 --> 47:21.926
Have you ever tried it?

47:21.926 --> 47:24.189
No. No, I've actually
never been to New York.

47:24.189 --> 47:25.364
- What?
- Wait.

47:25.364 --> 47:27.148
You're starting
a souvenir company

47:27.148 --> 47:28.454
and you've never been

47:28.454 --> 47:29.934
to the world's biggest
tourist destination?

47:29.934 --> 47:33.154
My parents traveled a lot,
just not with us.

47:33.154 --> 47:36.027
I always thought Sight Sealing
would sort of be my way

47:36.027 --> 47:37.463
to see the rest of the world.

47:37.463 --> 47:38.638
I'll tell ya what.

47:38.638 --> 47:40.118
When you make it to New York,

47:40.118 --> 47:42.468
I will be
your official tour guide.

47:43.251 --> 47:44.687
Deal.

47:46.907 --> 47:49.649
Didn't you get us lost
trying to find Central Park?

47:49.649 --> 47:51.433
- That was one time.
<i>- The</i> Central Park?

47:51.433 --> 47:52.913
- The big one?
- Yeah.

47:52.913 --> 47:54.654
Yeah, it's, like, in the center.

47:54.654 --> 47:56.961
- Whose side are you on?
- And it's a park.

47:56.961 --> 48:00.094
- One time. One time.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.575
That was one time!

48:02.575 --> 48:04.316
OK, I believe you. Jesus.

48:04.316 --> 48:07.014
Don't you dare.

48:07.014 --> 48:08.233
I need another one.

48:10.844 --> 48:12.454
Look at you, all smiles.

48:12.454 --> 48:14.717
They were really good empanadas.

48:14.717 --> 48:17.807
Right. Must be the empanadas.

48:17.807 --> 48:21.637
Nothing to do with the cute guy
who's clearly into you.

48:21.637 --> 48:23.770
We're just hanging out.

48:23.770 --> 48:27.121
Abby, I haven't seen that look
since your ninth birthday

48:27.121 --> 48:29.297
when you got
that Barbie Dream House.

48:29.297 --> 48:30.646
God, I loved that house.

48:30.646 --> 48:33.258
Here we go. Who ordered
the tres leches cake?

48:33.258 --> 48:35.173
- Oh, no, that's not ours.
- Shit.

48:35.173 --> 48:36.522
- She's kidding.
- Oh.

48:36.522 --> 48:38.176
I guess Chloe's can
go in the trash.

48:38.176 --> 48:39.699
Don't you dare!

48:39.699 --> 48:43.485
- Oh, uh, it's Sam. Hey.

48:46.575 --> 48:48.447
- Sam?
- My ex-girlfriend.

48:48.447 --> 48:49.970
She's, like, obsessed with me.

48:49.970 --> 48:53.974
I got you into
the A-List Film Awards.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.063
The ALFAs? Are you serious?

48:56.063 --> 48:58.979
Tomorrow, you will be at
the same event as Cooper Grant.

48:58.979 --> 49:01.460
So, am I in
the audience or something?

49:01.460 --> 49:03.723
Uh, yeah. Kind of.

49:03.723 --> 49:05.420
What do you mean, kind of?

49:07.814 --> 49:09.990
Your role as seat fillers

49:09.990 --> 49:12.993
is to do exactly
as the job title says.

49:13.428 --> 49:14.777
Fill seats.

49:16.344 --> 49:20.261
Take a look out at the theater.
Look at the theater. OK?

49:20.914 --> 49:25.701
See all those empty seats?
Those are the enemies.

49:25.701 --> 49:28.443
But that makes you the...

49:29.836 --> 49:31.055
heroes.

49:32.143 --> 49:34.797
OK, well, before we run
some routes, I wanted to...

49:34.797 --> 49:37.409
Excuse me,
are you practicing sitting?

49:37.409 --> 49:39.498
Huh? No. Not me.

49:39.498 --> 49:42.370
- Do you not know how to sit?
- No, that was her.

49:42.370 --> 49:44.285
I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:44.285 --> 49:46.679
Let's go ahead and get ready
for tonight, all right?

49:46.679 --> 49:49.377
When I'm walking, you follow me,
all right? Come on!

49:59.126 --> 50:02.651
<i>Thanks, again. Thank you.</i>

50:04.392 --> 50:06.699
Wait. Shouldn't you
be at this thing?

50:06.699 --> 50:08.005
Yes.

50:08.831 --> 50:10.050
I should.

50:10.659 --> 50:11.878
Hmm.

50:12.922 --> 50:14.881
Why am I so nervous?

50:15.925 --> 50:18.232
Do you want me to tell you
everything will be fine

50:18.232 --> 50:21.148
or do you want a list of things
that could go wrong

50:21.148 --> 50:22.976
that are actually
making you nervous

50:22.976 --> 50:25.587
because, I mean, I can think
of, like, 73 things...

50:25.587 --> 50:27.502
- Please stop talking.
- OK.

50:27.502 --> 50:30.331
We've got an open
next to Keanu. Keanu, OK?

50:30.331 --> 50:34.770
We got, uh, some squirming next
to Cooper Grant over here, OK?

50:34.770 --> 50:37.643
I see a possible bathroom break
happening here.

50:37.643 --> 50:40.080
Um, OK. Let's get into position.

50:40.080 --> 50:42.430
Who's on deck? OK.

50:44.563 --> 50:48.436
Hi. Uh, excuse me. Do you mind
if I take the next one?

50:48.436 --> 50:50.177
Short Stack.

50:50.177 --> 50:53.615
Patty. You're a seat filler too?
You weren't at the rehearsal.

50:53.615 --> 50:55.313
Well, you can't rehearse perfection.

50:55.313 --> 50:56.662
What are you doing here?

50:56.662 --> 50:58.707
I didn't realize
they hire booster seat fillers.

50:58.707 --> 51:00.927
- Seriously, I'm average height.
- Yeah.

51:00.927 --> 51:03.277
What'd you get nominated for?
Best Short?

51:03.277 --> 51:04.974
Let me show how
you it's done, kid.

51:09.936 --> 51:11.981
Sorry, Patty.

51:15.246 --> 51:17.987
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

51:17.987 --> 51:20.555
- Oh, cute dress. Excuse me.
- Ow.

51:20.555 --> 51:23.602
- Hello. Oops. Yeah. OK.
- Wow.

51:23.602 --> 51:25.647
I'm gonna just...

51:25.647 --> 51:29.347
All right. Oh.
That's your shoulder. Ooh, OK.

51:29.347 --> 51:31.305
<i>And now we bid farewell</i>

51:31.305 --> 51:34.482
<i>to the bright stars
we lost this past year.</i>

51:40.532 --> 51:44.753
Uh, Stephen Mills.
I loved that guy.

51:44.753 --> 51:47.495
- Huh?
- Oh, Stephen Mills.

51:48.583 --> 51:49.932
Right.

51:51.891 --> 51:54.067
Is that your acceptance speech?

51:54.067 --> 51:57.853
Yes. But I doubt
I'll be reading it.

51:57.853 --> 52:01.509
You're right.
Denzel's got this locked up.

52:06.993 --> 52:10.475
I never really know
what to say in these things.

52:10.475 --> 52:12.477
Well, um, if you need help,

52:12.477 --> 52:15.219
I'm... I'm kind of
a speechwriter.

52:15.219 --> 52:16.785
- Oh, yeah?
- Hm-hmm.

52:16.785 --> 52:19.875
When you're not dominating
musical chairs tournaments?

52:19.875 --> 52:22.487
A seat filler joke. That's good.

52:22.487 --> 52:25.751
No, but really, I write speeches
for the Mayor of New York.

52:25.751 --> 52:27.100
- Really?
- Hmm.

52:27.100 --> 52:29.929
Wow. I love that guy's speeches.

52:29.929 --> 52:31.800
- Really?
Shh.

52:38.764 --> 52:41.288
Well, Speechwriter...

52:41.288 --> 52:44.117
maybe you can tell me
if this is any good.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.686
Keep in mind that,
in some alternate universe,

52:47.686 --> 52:49.644
I may actually have to give
that speech...

52:49.644 --> 52:51.646
I'd cut the last two lines.

52:51.646 --> 52:54.606
- What?
- And move them to the front.

52:54.606 --> 52:58.175
Uh, the first thing you say sets
the tone for the entire speech.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.567
It's your hook.

53:01.308 --> 53:04.006
Oh, and this. This is good.

53:04.006 --> 53:07.009
Uh, do you have a pen?

53:07.009 --> 53:10.709
<i>And the nominees for Best
Actor in a Leading Role are...</i>

53:10.709 --> 53:14.843
<i>- Cooper Grant, "The Hedges".</i>
Oh, my God. That's her!

53:14.843 --> 53:17.890
- How did she get next to him?
- That's it. It's done.

53:17.890 --> 53:20.588
OK, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

53:20.588 --> 53:22.590
I'm a glass-half-full kinda gal.

53:22.590 --> 53:24.113
Oh, really?

53:24.113 --> 53:25.767
You think
sitting next to someone

53:25.767 --> 53:27.465
is halfway
to sleeping with them?

53:27.465 --> 53:29.771
- What?
- Quarter full?

53:29.771 --> 53:31.599
What?

53:31.599 --> 53:34.733
<i>- Denzel Washington...</i>
- What? What?

53:34.733 --> 53:36.169
Get over there.

53:36.169 --> 53:37.866
- I'm just kidding.
<i>- And the ALFA goes to...</i>

53:37.866 --> 53:39.868
<i>Cooper Grant, "The Hedges".</i>

53:56.363 --> 53:59.801
- OK. She looks like his wife.
- We did it.

53:59.801 --> 54:01.368
- Wow.
- We did do it.

54:07.679 --> 54:08.767
Wow.

54:13.250 --> 54:16.383
When I heard my name just now,
I thought,

54:16.383 --> 54:18.777
"That's a weird way
to pronounce Denzel."

54:22.520 --> 54:24.391
So, this...

54:24.391 --> 54:25.610
<i>This one's for you.</i>

54:25.610 --> 54:27.829
- I wrote that.
<i>- Thank you very much.</i>

54:32.007 --> 54:34.314
- Hey, speechwriter.
- Hi.

54:36.664 --> 54:38.275
- We did it.
- Ah!

54:39.101 --> 54:41.278
Shall we celebrate?

54:41.278 --> 54:43.671
- Yes.
- Come on.

54:43.671 --> 54:46.718
<i>Hi, Abby, it's Matt.
I think I just saw you on TV.</i>

54:46.718 --> 54:49.895
<i>I'll do whatever it takes.
Please don't shut me out.</i>

54:51.418 --> 54:53.855
Well, this is my flat.

54:55.814 --> 54:58.860
Looks pretty three-dimensional
to me.

54:58.860 --> 55:01.820
Right. OK,
I'm gonna hang my jacket up.

55:01.820 --> 55:03.778
- Be back in a second.
- OK.

55:17.226 --> 55:19.620
- Bonjour, darling.
- Oh, my God.

55:19.620 --> 55:22.449
Sorry. Didn't...
Didn't mean to startle you.

55:24.277 --> 55:25.539
Or did I?

55:27.019 --> 55:28.890
Ari Miller?

55:28.890 --> 55:31.676
Oh. You've heard of me?

55:31.676 --> 55:34.722
Heard of you? Your movies
are hilarious. You've...

55:34.722 --> 55:38.204
You've been nominated
for Best Actor three times.

55:38.204 --> 55:42.121
Was I? That's right, I was.

55:45.820 --> 55:49.911
Oh. I see you've met
my very well-dressed housemate.

55:50.956 --> 55:52.566
It's Ari Miller.

55:52.566 --> 55:55.047
I knew you guys did those
<i>Undercover</i> movies together,

55:55.047 --> 55:56.831
but you live together too?

55:56.831 --> 56:00.531
- That's so cool.
- Yes. It's so cool. Very cool.

56:00.531 --> 56:03.708
It is so cool, isn't it?

56:03.708 --> 56:05.057
That we live together.

56:05.057 --> 56:06.275
Well...
- So cool.

56:06.275 --> 56:08.016
Yeah.
- Very cool.

56:08.016 --> 56:11.629
Um, are they just
giving those away these days?

56:11.629 --> 56:14.022
Oh, hi.

56:14.022 --> 56:16.416
I'm just kidding.
That's... That's awesome.

56:16.416 --> 56:17.939
That's so awesome.

56:17.939 --> 56:20.594
Plus you've almost caught up
to me in nominations.

56:20.594 --> 56:24.859
You know, not... not quite,
but who's counting?

56:24.859 --> 56:27.819
Um, anyhow,
we were just about to head out.

56:27.819 --> 56:30.691
Actually, do you wanna
hang out here for a bit?

56:30.691 --> 56:33.825
I'd love to see
the rest of the house.

56:33.825 --> 56:37.785
I'm actually making
some spaghetti bolognese

56:37.785 --> 56:39.221
if you're interested.

56:40.614 --> 56:43.051
I've had it. Say you're a vegan.
I'll show you around.

56:43.051 --> 56:45.445
OK. Um...

56:45.445 --> 56:48.013
- Vegan.
- What was your name again?

56:48.579 --> 56:49.797
Bye.

56:54.802 --> 56:57.936
- This is so crazy.
- What is?

56:57.936 --> 56:59.938
Well, it's just...

56:59.938 --> 57:01.809
You think that some people exist

57:01.809 --> 57:04.159
on different planes
of the universe,

57:04.159 --> 57:07.032
and then you get in
the same room as them

57:07.032 --> 57:13.734
and... turns out they're just as
down to earth and normal as you.

57:13.734 --> 57:18.435
- Oh, so I'm just... just normal?
- You know what I mean.

57:24.005 --> 57:26.747
Sorry. I just have to ask.

57:26.747 --> 57:29.141
Did you know
that I lived with Ari Miller?

57:29.141 --> 57:31.012
No. I had no idea.

57:34.712 --> 57:36.714
It's just...

57:36.714 --> 57:40.544
Most girls, they come back here
just to get close with Ari.

57:40.544 --> 57:42.981
- You're kidding, right?
- No. I completely get it.

57:42.981 --> 57:45.157
The guy's basically
like a Greek god.

57:45.157 --> 57:47.028
Which... Which god, exactly?

57:50.379 --> 57:53.121
Oh. Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

57:53.121 --> 57:55.210
I didn't realize
you guys were in here.

57:55.210 --> 57:58.213
Don't mind me.
I'm just gonna, um, use the tub.

58:00.999 --> 58:02.914
- Huh?
- Why?

58:02.914 --> 58:04.916
Do a little splishy-splashy.

58:04.916 --> 58:08.397
Can you not splishy and splash
in your own bathtub?

58:10.791 --> 58:13.272
I... I... I could.

58:13.272 --> 58:14.926
You have your own bathroom.

58:14.926 --> 58:18.495
I'd rather use this tub.
The water pressure...

58:19.452 --> 58:20.975
OK.

58:26.503 --> 58:27.895
He just, like, wanders in.

58:27.895 --> 58:29.767
It's, like, how do I
compete with that?

58:29.767 --> 58:33.422
- I sincerely have no idea.
- Oh, this was such a bad idea.

58:33.422 --> 58:35.076
I shouldn't
have brought you here.

58:35.076 --> 58:39.037
Hey. You are Cooper Grant.

58:39.037 --> 58:43.563
You were on the Sexiest Man on
Earth list eight years in a row.

58:43.563 --> 58:47.567
- Who likes him more than you?
- You mean besides Scorsese?

58:47.567 --> 58:49.264
That was such a small part.

58:49.264 --> 58:52.093
Well, bigger than your no-part,
now isn't it?

58:52.093 --> 58:53.268
- Oh!
- You know what?

58:53.268 --> 58:55.880
- OK.
What?

58:56.881 --> 58:58.404
That is it. I've had enough.

58:58.404 --> 59:00.798
I'm sorry your girlfriend's
been ogling me all night.

59:00.798 --> 59:02.539
I have not
been ogling anyone.

59:02.539 --> 59:03.714
Were you ogling him?

59:03.714 --> 59:05.933
I don't even know
what ogling means.

59:05.933 --> 59:08.283
What are you gonna do about it,
tough guy?

59:08.283 --> 59:10.068
- Oh, no.

59:11.722 --> 59:13.288
- That is it.
- Hey!

59:17.989 --> 59:19.556
Guys?

59:24.125 --> 59:27.041
I don't think
this is appropriate.

59:41.273 --> 59:44.624
So, tell me everything.

59:44.624 --> 59:46.583
I just...
I just wanna get some sleep.

59:46.583 --> 59:49.324
Wait, no, wait.
I want some details.

59:50.717 --> 59:53.720
No... You don't.

59:53.720 --> 59:55.896
Wait. Did something weird
happen?

59:57.332 --> 01:00:00.161
You could say things
got weird...

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:02.294
when Ari Miller showed up.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:06.994
No way. Ari Miller?
He definitely has BDE.

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:08.735
So, what happened?

01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:14.262
Cooper, he...

01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:16.395
He pulled an ALFA
out of his ass.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:19.746
Yeah, I totally agree. That ALFA
was Denzel's to lose.

01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:22.270
No, no.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:25.186
Cooper literally pulled an ALFA

01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:29.103
out... of Ari's ass.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.066
I always wondered what they did

01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:37.111
with those things
after they won.

01:00:37.111 --> 01:00:40.941
I'm going to bed, and we are
never speaking of this again.

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:44.205
Is this a bad time to talk about
the next guy on your list?

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:47.295
Probably a bad time.

01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:03.094
Mr. Mayor. Oh, sorry.
Do I still call you that?

01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:04.965
Well, I'm still the mayor, Abby.

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:07.446
Right. Of course.

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:09.317
You know, we've tried out

01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:11.624
three different speechwriters
since you quit.

01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.278
Actually, you fired me.

01:01:13.278 --> 01:01:15.541
Details. I like that.

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:18.544
Having you gone
has made me realize something.

01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:22.330
<i>- I've missed ya, kiddo.</i>
- I've missed you too, sir.

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:25.594
Here you go. Want your truck?

01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:28.554
I was just saying hi to my son.
Sorry. Did you say something?

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:30.382
Uh, no.

01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:33.254
Listen...

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:36.649
It just hasn't felt the same
with you not around.

01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:38.825
So, I need you
to do something for me.

01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:42.394
- Anything, sir.
<i>- Get that sweet ass over here.</i>

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:45.702
I guess I could catch a red-eye.

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:50.358
What was that? I was just saying
hello to the missus.

01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:52.056
Oh, nothing.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.278
<i>Abby, nobody knows my voice
like you do.</i>

01:01:58.279 --> 01:01:59.846
I want you back
to write the speech

01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:01.152
that launches my campaign.

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:06.026
Uh...

01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.985
So, what do you say?

01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:10.378
You ready to sit
at the big-boy table?

01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:17.516
<i>- Abby?</i>
- Oh, you're talking to me.

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:19.083
Yes. I'm in.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:20.388
Great.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:24.131
I'd like to see a draft next
week at the kickoff meeting.

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.394
See ya, buddy.

01:02:27.569 --> 01:02:28.353
Hey.

01:02:29.528 --> 01:02:31.573
I was starting to think
you weren't gonna show up.

01:02:31.573 --> 01:02:33.575
Sorry. Rough night.

01:02:33.575 --> 01:02:37.449
Hmm. Try being a server
at a <i>Real Housewives</i> reunion.

01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:38.624
You ready to go?

01:02:47.285 --> 01:02:50.592
I think you've seen
<i>The Goonies</i> too many times.

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:53.682
- You good?
- I'm a New Yorker.

01:02:53.682 --> 01:02:55.423
I walk 30 blocks
to work every day

01:02:55.423 --> 01:02:57.599
in three-inch heels. I'm good.

01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.863
Well, I hear you, but...

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.995
hiking in LA
is a bit different terrain,

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:03.344
so you gotta watch every step.

01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:04.824
I used to hike
up the Adirondacks

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:06.521
with my dad
every summer till I was 17.

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:09.307
- Really?
- No.

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:11.352
OK.

01:03:45.734 --> 01:03:48.041
I honestly have never even
thought about it.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:49.956
Every guy has a list.

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:53.046
I had a shot with J.Lo once.
She was on stage

01:03:53.046 --> 01:03:55.266
and I was in the nosebleeds.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:58.008
But there was definite
long-distance eye lock.

01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:01.663
You think
this whole thing's stupid?

01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:04.536
I think everybody has a fantasy

01:04:04.536 --> 01:04:07.278
about spending a night
with a celebrity.

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:08.714
But I think finding someone

01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:11.804
to spend the rest of your life
with, that's...

01:04:11.804 --> 01:04:13.588
that's the fantasy.

01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:18.550
Oh. I almost forgot.
I have something to show you.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.422
Sight Sealing's first prototype.

01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:22.902
I like it.
- Yes?

01:04:22.902 --> 01:04:24.338
Yeah.
- Yes.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.471
Well, I hope Vanderton Capital
likes it as well.

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:28.299
I have a pitch meeting
next week.

01:04:28.299 --> 01:04:30.649
After that, I don't really know.

01:04:30.649 --> 01:04:32.651
Well, I think it's great.

01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:34.392
And that's coming from someone

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:37.308
who's had very few moments
worth saving lately.

01:04:37.308 --> 01:04:39.223
I wouldn't give up.

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:43.749
- What?
- We just met and...

01:04:43.749 --> 01:04:46.665
you're already making me
believe in things

01:04:46.665 --> 01:04:49.015
that I was starting to doubt.

01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:50.364
Your company?

01:04:50.843 --> 01:04:52.540
Your company, actually.

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:55.195
Just being here with you.

01:04:55.282 --> 01:04:58.068
Forgot how nice it was
to have a moment worth sealing.

01:04:59.852 --> 01:05:01.680
You think this is one?

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.554
I honestly can't think
of anything better.

01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:56.691
Wow, you're really done, huh?

01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:58.432
It probably wasn't
the healthiest way

01:05:58.432 --> 01:05:59.781
to deal with things.

01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:01.435
Is this about Matt or Jake?

01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:03.133
I don't need
to chase celebrities

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:04.917
to prove something to myself.

01:06:05.526 --> 01:06:08.529
Abby Meyers, I am proud of you.

01:06:12.098 --> 01:06:15.188
All right. So, now what?

01:06:15.188 --> 01:06:18.931
Well, I'm supposed to see Jake
tomorrow night.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:23.588
That's great.
Amazing. Fantastic.

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:26.634
Wonderful. Love that for you.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:32.553
Are you OK? You just
turned into a thesaurus.

01:06:34.207 --> 01:06:37.341
Yeah, it's just, um...

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:41.127
Sam and I have been spending
a lot of time together

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:44.435
and now I'm worried that because
you're done with your list,

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:47.177
I might be done
with the one girl on mine.

01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.312
Sam's here.

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:55.881
OK.

01:06:56.621 --> 01:07:00.277
So, I know my leads
have gone cold

01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:02.888
- but they just got hot again.
- What's that now?

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:06.587
Just invites to the hottest
party in town tomorrow night.

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:08.459
A certain rapper
by the name of Avon

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.200
is rumored
to be in attendance.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.377
- Yeah, Sam, about that...
- Can't wait.

01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:15.422
Perfect.
I will go confirm all of us.

01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:16.728
Hm-hmm.

01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:21.298
I thought you were done
with the list.

01:07:21.298 --> 01:07:23.952
You've been my lifeline
for the last three weeks.

01:07:23.952 --> 01:07:27.304
The least I can do is be yours
for one night to win back Sam.

01:07:27.304 --> 01:07:30.089
But you have plans
with Jake tomorrow.

01:07:30.089 --> 01:07:32.613
I have all weekend
before I leave.

01:07:35.225 --> 01:07:36.400
We're confirmed.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.228
Whoo!

01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:40.360
Are you sure?

01:07:40.578 --> 01:07:42.841
Can't pass up a shot
at someone on your list, right?

01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:49.630
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:29.234
- Are you ready? You look good.
- I am. Thank you.

01:08:31.455 --> 01:08:33.892
You're really sexy
when I drink.

01:08:33.892 --> 01:08:35.023
Oh!

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.982
I think that sounds like
an insult,

01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:38.723
but I'm sort of OK with it.

01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:40.854
- I'll go get more then.
- Yep. Yep.

01:08:40.854 --> 01:08:43.858
You get many, many more
of those.

01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:46.774
Go, go, my little angel face.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.037
It's like the old Sam
and Chloe.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.866
I know, right?

01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:55.000
Thank you, by the way.

01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:58.350
I mean, this means
so much to me.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.354
- Cheers to you guys.
- Cheers.

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:05.618
Thank you.

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:21.331
Abs, Chlo.
- Yeah?

01:09:21.331 --> 01:09:24.508
Avon's right over there.
You gonna go talk to him?

01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:29.513
It's why we're here.

01:09:29.513 --> 01:09:31.167
- Yeah.
- Hm-hmm.

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:36.563
- Then go over there.
- Right. OK, yeah.

01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:42.439
Now. Got it. Yeah.

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.484
She's making me nervous.

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:47.444
- You did really great.
- Thank you.

01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:00.239
OK.

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:08.769
Hi. I'm sorry. Oh.

01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:10.684
Hey. I know this sounds
really weird,

01:10:10.684 --> 01:10:12.512
but I need you
to go along with it.

01:10:12.512 --> 01:10:13.948
Excuse me?

01:10:13.948 --> 01:10:15.863
I need you to go along
with what I'm about to do.

01:10:18.344 --> 01:10:19.998
Do you have a bomb
strapped to you?

01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:21.173
What? No.

01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:22.696
Cos you're kinda acting
like someone

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:24.263
who's got a bomb
strapped to them.

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:26.918
No. I don't have a bomb.
It's just... I'm trying to...

01:10:26.918 --> 01:10:29.486
Don't look at them.
I'm trying to help my friend

01:10:29.486 --> 01:10:31.052
get back together with her ex,

01:10:31.052 --> 01:10:33.054
so I need to pretend
to hit on you

01:10:33.054 --> 01:10:34.621
because you're on
my free-pass list.

01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:40.236
Why do I feel like
I'm gonna regret this?

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.498
Just be cool, OK?

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.456
Cool.

01:10:45.197 --> 01:10:47.068
She's totally doing this.
I wanna hear it.

01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:49.375
- No, you don't.
- Yes. We'll be chill.

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:52.987
Yeah.

01:10:52.987 --> 01:10:55.642
We <i>do</i> share
the same zodiac sign.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.340
What's with the voice?

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.559
You're talking so loudly
all of a sudden.

01:11:00.734 --> 01:11:02.519
You're doing
the bomb girl thing?

01:11:02.519 --> 01:11:05.173
- You're...
- I think you're da bomb too.

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:09.526
- Right, um...
- Yes.

01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:13.791
Has my heart known
love till this night?

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:15.227
That was so good.

01:11:15.227 --> 01:11:19.362
In touching her,
make blessed my rude hand.

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:24.018
Did my heart love till thee?
Forswear it, sight.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:28.284
- For I ne'er in truer beauty...
- Let's go over there.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.112
- ...than now.
- Did you just quote Shakespeare?

01:11:31.809 --> 01:11:34.812
- Yeah. No good?
- No. Really good. They're gone.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:36.727
Oh. OK.

01:11:37.945 --> 01:11:40.992
So, I gotta say,
I get hit on a lot,

01:11:40.992 --> 01:11:43.386
but never pretend hit on.

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:47.390
Oh. Well, thanks. I owe you one.

01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:52.220
So, I didn't get your name.

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:54.788
Abby.

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:55.876
Abby, Abby, Abby.

01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:58.009
It's just nice
to know the person

01:11:58.009 --> 01:12:00.446
who's got you
on their free-pass list.

01:12:00.446 --> 01:12:02.796
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:07.061
Um, you're on my list, but I
don't want to sleep with you.

01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:10.369
Wow. You managed to objectify

01:12:10.369 --> 01:12:12.023
and reject me
all in one sentence.

01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:14.982
- Shit.
- What?

01:12:14.982 --> 01:12:16.506
No, no, no. Don't. Don't look.

01:12:16.506 --> 01:12:18.464
My ex is coming over here
right now

01:12:18.464 --> 01:12:21.075
and she'd get really pissed
if she saw me here with someone.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.948
So, pretend you're with me now.

01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:26.298
- Like we just did?
- Not at all like we just did.

01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:27.778
- OK.
- Just follow my lead.

01:12:27.778 --> 01:12:30.650
- All right. OK.
- Come here.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:31.869
Hey, you.

01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:35.176
Avon, didn't know you were here.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:39.224
Usually you demand
they play your music all night.

01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:40.747
Oh. I don't demand it.

01:12:40.747 --> 01:12:42.314
- The public does.
- Hmm.

01:12:42.314 --> 01:12:44.969
Meet my girlfriend, Abby.

01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:46.405
Hi.

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:50.366
Kenzie Scott.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:54.065
- Nice to meet you.
- I didn't know you two dated.

01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:56.981
"Dated." It was barely a month.

01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:59.505
One I'm still trying to forget.

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:02.508
Don't worry, I pretty much
forgot it right when it started.

01:13:03.422 --> 01:13:04.945
I can't believe
he slept with you.

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:06.077
Excuse me?

01:13:06.077 --> 01:13:07.861
Thought we were following
my lead.

01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:09.254
We were engaged.

01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:13.127
Wait, you two are engaged?

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:16.522
I think what she means is that

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:19.351
we are engaged
in the first stages...

01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.527
We were supposed to get married
next week.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:22.659
Or not.

01:13:22.659 --> 01:13:24.095
What exactly
are we talking about?

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:25.966
We're talking about
you sleeping with my fiancé

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:27.751
because you were on
his stupid list.

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:30.667
Who's your fiancé?

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.408
The guy you slept with
in New York

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:35.019
when you were out there
doing those two huge movies.

01:13:38.065 --> 01:13:40.546
- Matt?
- Yeah.

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:43.462
He was engaged?

01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:48.249
I'm sorry.

01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:51.296
Look, if I had known, trust me,

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:54.081
I would've spared my Louboutins
the climb to his walk-up.

01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:58.259
Don't worry. Just a marriage
ruined for some fantasy night

01:13:58.259 --> 01:13:59.957
with a medium-talent actress

01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:01.915
who's only relevant
because of her...

01:14:02.786 --> 01:14:05.441
very, very pretty face.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:09.923
OK. You know,
I'm on a lot of people's lists.

01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:13.536
So, maybe instead of
pointing the finger at me,

01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:17.061
you should figure out
why your man acted on it.

01:14:26.723 --> 01:14:28.855
- Hurricane Kenzie.
- Hmm.

01:14:28.855 --> 01:14:31.945
Always leaving destruction
in her path.

01:14:33.425 --> 01:14:34.600
Cute new girlfriend.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.124
- Yeah, she's great, right?
- Hmm.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.136
You OK?

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.489
Did I drive Matt away?

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:58.624
No, no. Don't start with that,
OK? None of this is your fault.

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:04.500
I just feel like every decision
I make is the wrong one.

01:15:06.632 --> 01:15:11.071
Look, I get it. I've been there.

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:16.163
You feel totally lost
and then something happens,

01:15:16.163 --> 01:15:17.687
and suddenly you're not.

01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:20.559
Hey.

01:15:21.429 --> 01:15:24.694
Hey, I'm really sorry
about what happened back there.

01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:28.785
Not what I was expecting,
but sure.

01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:35.748
Is this why you canceled?

01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:40.100
- Jake. It's not like that.
- It kinda looks like that.

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:43.277
- Kinda felt like that.
- Avon. Not helping.

01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:45.671
So, this is the guy
you're marrying next week.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:47.368
You're still engaged?

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:52.852
You and Matt like to chase
after celebrities so much,

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:54.637
maybe you two belong together.

01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:58.902
Jake. Wait, I... I should go.

01:15:58.902 --> 01:16:01.818
- Um, great lips.
- All right.

01:16:01.818 --> 01:16:03.210
Jake.

01:16:04.864 --> 01:16:08.302
You have a fascinating
love life, Abby.

01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:12.393
Jake.

01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:36.330
Jake.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:39.638
Please call me. I really
want to talk and explain.

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:41.814
I leave in a few days, and...

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:43.642
Hey, Abby.

01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:48.604
Hi.

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:52.085
Could we go somewhere and talk?

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.174
Uh, yeah.

01:16:58.657 --> 01:17:00.746
Sorry for surprising you
like this.

01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:03.270
You weren't picking up
any of my calls.

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:07.797
Our wedding planner
called yesterday.

01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:10.626
She was checking on the set list
for the band.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.671
- About the wedding, I just...
- Wait.

01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:14.368
Just before you say anything.

01:17:15.456 --> 01:17:16.632
I just...

01:17:19.025 --> 01:17:21.506
I don't want this to be
the thing that ends us.

01:17:22.681 --> 01:17:24.944
If there is any small part
of you

01:17:24.944 --> 01:17:26.293
that still wants to marry me,

01:17:26.293 --> 01:17:28.644
please give me a chance
to make this right.

01:17:28.992 --> 01:17:30.646
Why would I do that, Matt?

01:17:32.386 --> 01:17:36.129
Because even if you don't think
I deserve a chance,

01:17:36.129 --> 01:17:38.436
<i>we</i> deserve one.

01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:42.222
Five years.

01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:44.877
We were together for five years.

01:17:44.877 --> 01:17:47.837
And what? You throw it
for a stupid one-night stand?

01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:51.492
Look, if...

01:17:51.928 --> 01:17:54.626
If you decide that you don't
want to speak to me again,

01:17:54.626 --> 01:17:55.975
I'll respect that.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.238
But then I want the last thing

01:17:58.238 --> 01:18:00.545
you hear from me
to be these vows.

01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.113
Because whether
we get married or not,

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.203
this is how I will always feel.

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:16.996
"Abby, when we first met,
it was love at first sight.

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:19.695
Then over the next few years,

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.610
I learned that the only thing
better than love at first sight

01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:24.743
was love at every sight.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:29.356
- You are a perfectionist."

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.924
"And somehow, I still managed

01:18:31.924 --> 01:18:34.448
to get you to say yes
to marrying me.

01:18:36.233 --> 01:18:38.104
So, I know now

01:18:38.104 --> 01:18:41.325
that I don't have to be perfect
for us to be.

01:18:42.326 --> 01:18:47.723
But I will spend the rest of
our days trying to be for you."

01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:54.033
Do you really mean all that?

01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:56.209
Every word.

01:18:56.819 --> 01:19:00.518
I just... I just don't know if I
can go through with the wedding.

01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:02.433
We will push it off.

01:19:03.216 --> 01:19:06.524
Abby, we have
the rest of our lives together.

01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:09.962
That's the part
that I wanna get right.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.138
OK?

01:19:13.661 --> 01:19:14.793
OK.

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.448
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19:18.666 --> 01:19:19.755
OK.

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:33.638
We will figure it all out
when you're back in New York.

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:40.340
- Sorry. I'm just not ready.
- It's OK.

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.867
Hold me.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.785
Goodnight.

01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:53.092
Came all the way out here,

01:19:53.092 --> 01:19:54.833
you still can't escape
a walk-up, huh?

01:19:59.229 --> 01:20:00.926
So, everything with Kenzie Scott

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:03.320
happened the night
we got engaged?

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:06.149
You really wanna talk about that
right now?

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:09.195
Well, I just realized you were
living in your own place then.

01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:10.544
The high-rise.

01:20:11.763 --> 01:20:13.634
Yeah. So?

01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:16.724
I just ran into Kenzie
at the party,

01:20:16.724 --> 01:20:18.639
and she mentioned
you having a walk-up.

01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:23.688
I...

01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:28.258
It wasn't just that night,
was it?

01:20:29.476 --> 01:20:31.870
It was also at our place
after you moved in.

01:20:35.265 --> 01:20:37.833
How many times
did you sleep with her, Matt?

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:41.227
Abby, I'm sorry.

01:20:41.227 --> 01:20:44.578
- I can't believe you.
- I promise. It's over. Abby.

01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:49.496
- Fuck. Fuck.

01:21:26.359 --> 01:21:29.145
Excuse me.
What do you think you're doing?

01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:32.104
- Uh...
- You can't just throw rocks.

01:21:32.104 --> 01:21:33.627
You could've hurt someone.

01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:36.239
I mean, they're pretty far away.

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:39.633
I'm sorry!

01:21:54.822 --> 01:21:56.128
Go.

01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:22.415
Anything from Jake?

01:22:25.505 --> 01:22:28.552
Maybe this is just
a really twisted road

01:22:28.552 --> 01:22:30.162
to you ending up
with Oscar Isaac.

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:36.386
Chloe, I never really
got a chance to thank you.

01:22:37.213 --> 01:22:40.607
Abby, you're my best friend.
You never have to.

01:22:41.565 --> 01:22:43.393
Plus, selfishly, I had no chance

01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:45.438
to get back with Sam
without you.

01:22:45.438 --> 01:22:48.398
I always knew
you two would end up together.

01:22:48.398 --> 01:22:49.703
No, you didn't.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:51.923
Literally was expecting
a restraining order.

01:22:51.923 --> 01:22:53.533
Yep. That tracks.

01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:55.448
What's for breakfast?

01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:57.711
Oh, the Chloe Breakfast Special.

01:22:57.711 --> 01:23:01.759
- Mmm. I love Cheerios.

01:23:01.759 --> 01:23:03.848
Anything you want to do
before your flight today?

01:23:04.544 --> 01:23:06.068
Not to be boring,

01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:07.808
but I think I'm just gonna
get to the airport early.

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:09.593
I have a meeting for the mayor
when I land

01:23:09.593 --> 01:23:12.552
and I haven't even thought of
the hook for his speech yet.

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:15.599
Oh, shoot. That reminds me.
Um, where...

01:23:15.599 --> 01:23:16.861
Oh!

01:23:18.167 --> 01:23:20.343
This came in the mail for you.

01:23:27.741 --> 01:23:29.308
Holy shit, he did it.

01:23:30.353 --> 01:23:32.050
Let's clip in, everyone.

01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:36.272
You again.

01:23:36.272 --> 01:23:39.405
Maybe the Mommy and Me class
is more your speed.

01:23:39.405 --> 01:23:43.366
- But I'm not a mom.
- I was thinking more the Me.

01:23:46.543 --> 01:23:48.023
Hey.

01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:52.505
- Look, I really don't...
- No, hey. I get it.

01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:55.073
But I just, I really don't like

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:56.683
how things went down
the other night.

01:23:56.683 --> 01:23:58.990
It's fine. And honestly,
what you said...

01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:01.340
- Was totally out of line.
- No.

01:24:02.515 --> 01:24:03.777
You were right.

01:24:03.777 --> 01:24:07.042
I was avoiding
the real reason Matt did it.

01:24:07.694 --> 01:24:10.915
Turns out, it's because
he's an asshole

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:13.831
who never really cared
about me, so...

01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:15.485
You girls recognize these?

01:24:15.485 --> 01:24:17.791
They're called seats.
Now take one.

01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:19.663
Isn't Jake
usually in this class?

01:24:19.663 --> 01:24:21.230
Hasn't missed one in two years.

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:22.883
Said he had
some kind of meeting.

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.798
The Sight Sealing pitch.

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:31.283
All right, everyone.
It's time to grind.

01:24:41.685 --> 01:24:43.513
Need a ride?

01:24:44.427 --> 01:24:45.950
- Really?
- Come on.

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.778
We'll be like
Thelma and Louise.

01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:49.562
Don't they drive off a cliff?

01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:51.912
I can get you there
in 15 minutes.

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:54.263
Great. OK.

01:24:58.005 --> 01:24:59.572
OK.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.793
So, where are we going?

01:25:04.447 --> 01:25:07.450
Vanderton Capital.
- Here we go.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.374
Sight Sealing
forces you to stop,

01:25:18.374 --> 01:25:20.158
literally take in
the air around you

01:25:20.158 --> 01:25:24.119
and preserve the moments that
you want to hold on to forever.

01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:26.991
So, it's just...

01:25:26.991 --> 01:25:28.601
- air in a bottle?
- Uh...

01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:32.779
Yes. Yes,
but the air is a novelty.

01:25:34.912 --> 01:25:38.698
But ultimately, it's ten bucks
for a bottle of air, right?

01:25:40.744 --> 01:25:42.224
I just want you to know

01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:44.226
that if I'd had any idea
he was in a relationship,

01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:46.315
- there is no...
- Look, Kenzie Scott...

01:25:46.315 --> 01:25:49.100
- Just Kenzie's fine.
- OK, Kenzie...

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.624
Mm, actually,
can you do Kenzie Scott?

01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:53.278
I <i>do</i> like it better.

01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:56.238
Are you sure
we're going the right way?

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:58.414
I feel like
we passed that gas station.

01:25:58.414 --> 01:26:00.416
Yeah,
but the last time we passed it,

01:26:00.416 --> 01:26:01.678
it was on the other side.

01:26:05.203 --> 01:26:07.858
It seems like it would be
more successful in New York.

01:26:07.858 --> 01:26:10.513
- Why not launch it there?
- Uh, yes.

01:26:10.513 --> 01:26:12.428
Uh, I thought about that.

01:26:12.428 --> 01:26:16.258
Um, it's... There's... a lot of,
like, bureaucratic red tape

01:26:16.258 --> 01:26:19.304
in New York with the landmarks.

01:26:19.304 --> 01:26:21.872
You know, it's the, um...

01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:23.787
I agree. Yeah, it would...
It would...

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:25.702
It would do well in New York.

01:26:25.702 --> 01:26:28.966
I did think of that. Um...

01:26:28.966 --> 01:26:30.620
Honestly, I'm past all of it.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:34.363
My mind's on other things now.
That's what this is about.

01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:36.365
All right. Then go get him.

01:26:38.105 --> 01:26:39.455
Wait. Why are we stopped?

01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:41.805
Oh, yeah, we've been here
for five minutes.

01:26:41.805 --> 01:26:42.936
Jesus!

01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:07.396
I agree.
I think it would be smarter

01:27:07.396 --> 01:27:09.702
to launch
in New York and California.

01:27:09.702 --> 01:27:11.182
Sorry to interrupt
but I have something

01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.357
that will make Sight Sealing

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:14.054
an even more
compelling investment.

01:27:14.054 --> 01:27:16.883
Mr. Barbiero, what is this?

01:27:16.883 --> 01:27:19.712
I'm sorry. I couldn't leave
without giving you this.

01:27:27.503 --> 01:27:30.245
Hey. Hey. Abby.

01:27:31.115 --> 01:27:32.377
You forgot this.

01:27:33.683 --> 01:27:35.772
You're Kenzie Scott. Oh, man.

01:27:35.772 --> 01:27:37.730
- I'm a huge fan.
- Oh.

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:39.428
You were great
in that cave movie.

01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:40.994
Thank you.

01:27:44.868 --> 01:27:47.218
- Abby, what are you doing here?
- I spent the last few weeks

01:27:47.218 --> 01:27:48.654
chasing some stupid list

01:27:48.654 --> 01:27:50.656
instead of seeing
what was right in front of me.

01:27:51.353 --> 01:27:54.094
Excuse me. What is this?

01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:58.577
This is written permission from
Mayor Capozzi for Sight Sealing

01:27:58.577 --> 01:28:00.753
to use any New York City landmark.

01:28:00.753 --> 01:28:02.407
- What?
- And that's just the beginning.

01:28:02.407 --> 01:28:04.844
Let me tell you something
about this man.

01:28:04.844 --> 01:28:07.282
He is not just a visionary.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:14.114
He is the most passionate, yet
grounded person I have ever met.

01:28:14.114 --> 01:28:18.205
And I have seen him
take a company

01:28:18.205 --> 01:28:22.297
that was utterly lost and broken

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:25.430
and give it purpose again.

01:28:27.867 --> 01:28:30.392
And sure, maybe that company
was a little misguided

01:28:30.392 --> 01:28:32.132
in trying to sleep
with famous companies

01:28:32.132 --> 01:28:34.352
to get back at the evil company
it used to be linked to, but...

01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:35.919
Are they still talking
about the bottles?

01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:37.747
- Who knows?
- You have a choice.

01:28:37.747 --> 01:28:39.183
Do you wanna invest in a startup

01:28:39.183 --> 01:28:41.316
that will take the souvenir
industry by storm?

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.970
This could be the very moment
that defines the future of...

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.843
What's this firm again?

01:28:46.843 --> 01:28:49.672
- Abby, they already said yes.
- Wait, what?

01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:52.457
We're launching with the
Hollywood Air bottle next month.

01:28:55.286 --> 01:28:56.592
What do you think about

01:28:56.592 --> 01:28:58.768
also launching the Empire State
Building bottle?

01:28:58.768 --> 01:29:01.031
We'd have to talk about
increasing the seed money.

01:29:01.031 --> 01:29:03.773
Get the fuck outta here.
Sorry. Yes.

01:29:03.773 --> 01:29:06.253
Yes. Amazing.

01:29:08.212 --> 01:29:10.345
What the hell are these things?

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.477
Um...

01:29:12.477 --> 01:29:15.132
I can't believe you got
the mayor to do all this.

01:29:15.132 --> 01:29:16.655
Kind of a big deal.

01:29:17.482 --> 01:29:19.702
Hey, did you...

01:29:19.702 --> 01:29:22.618
Did you... Did you really mean
everything you said in there?

01:29:22.618 --> 01:29:23.923
Of course.

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.709
You know I was the company, right?

01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:28.537
You were? Of course I knew.

01:29:36.588 --> 01:29:38.721
Did somebody say,
"Race to the airport?"

01:29:39.243 --> 01:29:41.985
No, no one said that.
I'm gonna call a car.

01:29:41.985 --> 01:29:43.856
Smart. I probably
shouldn't drive

01:29:43.856 --> 01:29:45.292
since I don't have a license.

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:51.995
- Abby.
- Yeah?

01:29:54.737 --> 01:29:57.566
The car pickup is on
the other side of the building.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.049
OK, OK, OK.

01:30:15.975 --> 01:30:18.630
- So many stairs!
- I know.

01:30:22.939 --> 01:30:24.462
Short Stack.

01:30:26.072 --> 01:30:27.770
You gotta be kidding me.

01:30:29.902 --> 01:30:31.861
OK. All right.

01:30:41.697 --> 01:30:43.525
Don't worry. I got it.

01:30:43.525 --> 01:30:45.483
- Wasn't worried.
- Yeah.

01:30:53.535 --> 01:30:55.537
You need a child seat
back there?

01:31:02.108 --> 01:31:04.110
<i>Hey. I hope
you made your flight.</i>

01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:06.591
<i>Sounds like I'll be coming
to New York soon.</i>

01:31:06.591 --> 01:31:09.594
<i>Can't wait to see
some of your favorite spots.</i>

01:31:09.594 --> 01:31:11.770
<i>Oh, and good luck
at the big meeting.</i>

01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:13.119
<i>If it doesn't go well,</i>

01:31:13.119 --> 01:31:14.643
<i>I can always barge in
and save the day,</i>

01:31:14.643 --> 01:31:17.950
<i>because, you know,
I guess I owe you one.</i>

01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:42.497
<i>Please turn off
all electronic devices.</i>

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.586
<i>Once airborne,
the captain will let you know</i>

01:31:44.586 --> 01:31:47.371
<i>when you can use
approved electronic devices.</i>

01:31:47.371 --> 01:31:49.460
<i>Please review
the in-flight magazine</i>

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.375
<i>for a list of approved devices.</i>

01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:00.471
They never hold the plane
for me.

01:32:01.037 --> 01:32:02.038
Sorry?

01:32:02.255 --> 01:32:03.866
They delayed
us to let someone on.

01:32:03.866 --> 01:32:05.650
I mean, it must be
someone important.

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:11.177
Excuse me.

01:32:12.091 --> 01:32:15.965
Hi. Is that Oscar Isaac
in first class?

01:32:16.313 --> 01:32:17.967
We're really not supposed
to say.

01:32:19.795 --> 01:32:22.885
Oscar Isaac?
Oh, my God, he's on my list.

01:32:22.885 --> 01:32:24.321
- What list?
- You know.

01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:26.366
My list of celebrities
I can sleep with.

01:32:26.366 --> 01:32:28.412
I didn't know you had a list.

01:32:28.412 --> 01:32:30.849
Of course I have a list.
Monogamy 101.
