PURRING

00:03.840 --> 00:06.000
BELL RINGS

00:09.120 --> 00:10.560
I have to go.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.520
You behave today.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.840
BELL RINGS

00:27.960 --> 00:30.000
I've been thinking,
whoever the thief is,

00:30.000 --> 00:31.960
they're going to keep stealing
from us,

00:31.960 --> 00:34.000
so we need to do something
about it. Like what?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.840
We should go to the village jeweller

00:35.840 --> 00:37.880
and ask who sold Gwen's brooch
to him.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.000
Good morning, girls. Good morning.
Good morning, Mr Parker.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.360
So glad you could join us, Ellen.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.120
Uh, sorry, Mr Parker.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.800
So, while I wait for the others,
are you all looking forward

00:50.800 --> 00:52.320
to the quiz tomorrow?

00:52.320 --> 00:55.720
Last year, Malory Towers got
thrashed by Thackerton Boys

00:55.720 --> 00:59.320
in a local derby, so I hope we're
not looking at a repeat performance.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.560
Not a chance. But be warned.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.920
Um, I did some teacher training
at Thackerton College,

01:05.920 --> 01:08.200
and they take this very seriously.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.400
They'll try to intimidate you,
undermine you in any way

01:12.400 --> 01:15.400
that they can.
That is why we need a captain

01:15.400 --> 01:19.160
that is quick-witted, hardworking
and a real all-rounder.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.640
I believe there's one girl that's
really demonstrated these qualities

01:23.640 --> 01:26.960
and more this term, which is
why I've decided

01:26.960 --> 01:29.360
that this year's captain will be...

01:29.360 --> 01:31.440
Darrell. Oh!

01:31.440 --> 01:32.800
Congrats!

01:32.800 --> 01:34.120
Oh, thank you!

01:34.120 --> 01:35.840
Your team-mates will be Alicia,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.800
Jean and Ellen.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.560
Me? Well, your name IS Ellen,
isn't it?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.440
GIGGLING

01:43.440 --> 01:45.800
The other questions
won't be that easy.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.000
But I have faith in you.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.160
Over the past few weeks,
you've really demonstrated the kind

01:50.160 --> 01:52.760
of academic excellence
I know you're capable of.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.520
But this isn't an essay.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.040
I'm no good
when I'm put on the spot.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.640
You're a super-smart scholarship
girl. You'll be great.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.040
Uh, Ellen, where are you going?

02:04.040 --> 02:06.480
I-I need to prepare.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.680
We haven't had class yet.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.760
GIGGLING

02:08.680 --> 02:10.760
Oh.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.320
Ron?

02:38.320 --> 02:41.160
Do you want something?
You know that brooch

02:41.160 --> 02:43.840
you took to the jeweller's?
Yeah.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.240
I wondered if you could get it back
for me.

02:46.240 --> 02:50.840
I've realised I can't bear to part
with it. So many happy memories.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.760
I thought you needed the money
to buy treats for your next trip.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.640
My pocket money's finally come
through, so I'll use that.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.160
Well, I can't go today. I've got
too much to do in the garden.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.480
Can't it wait?
I could go tomorrow.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.960
Very well.

03:03.960 --> 03:08.360
But remember not to tell anyone
anything about this.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.760
Not a word.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.760
I told you I wouldn't, didn't I?

03:21.800 --> 03:24.040
Ah, there you are.
I was just saying I think we should

03:24.040 --> 03:27.440
practise the quiz at lunchtime.
Uh, how do you practise a quiz?

03:27.440 --> 03:30.200
Er, revise topics likely to come up.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.360
Capital cities, highest mountains,
things like that, so we can split

03:33.360 --> 03:36.400
them up evenly between us.
Sounds like a good plan.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.320
You're all going to be brilliant.
I'm sorry you're not on the team.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.880
It's probably for the best.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.840
Unless there's a question
on Gregorian chants,

03:42.840 --> 03:44.240
I'd be pretty much useless.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.720
Gregory, who?

03:45.720 --> 03:49.200
Gregorian chant.
Oh, sacred song sung in Latin.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.880
It's usually credited to Pope
Gregory I, but...

03:51.880 --> 03:53.760
Thank you, Irene.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.600
Um, where's Ellen?

03:55.600 --> 03:58.360
I'm not sure. She vanishes a lot,
doesn't she?

03:58.360 --> 04:00.720
She just likes studying
without distractions.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.440
Nobody studies THAT much!

04:02.440 --> 04:05.560
Ellen does. Perhaps that's
what she wants us to think.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.160
Sometimes she has to feed the cat
too.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.160
Oh... What? I thought Matron
told Ron to take him away.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.920
Ellen persuaded him to keep it
hidden instead.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.600
She's been looking after it.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.640
She should have told us.
We could have helped.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.680
I think she needed somewhere private
she could have some time on her own.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.800
Just cos she's got some cat
hidden away

04:23.800 --> 04:26.280
doesn't mean she's not on the way
to the jeweller right now.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.840
Probably planning to bribe him
to keep quiet about Gwen's brooch.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.200
I hope you're not suggesting
Ellen is the thief.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.880
Things have only started
going missing after she arrived.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.520
Coincidence? Yes! She is a good,
honest person. Well, if it's not

04:37.520 --> 04:39.280
her, then it's somebody
else from our dorm,

04:39.280 --> 04:41.920
and I don't think anybody else is
capable of something like this.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.240
I'm not going to sit here

04:43.240 --> 04:46.000
listening to you pick on my friend.
Jean, please.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.000
You can't go around throwing
accusations like that.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.880
I want to find out who's been doing
this, and...

04:55.280 --> 04:57.880
..I just want us to go back
to the way we used to be.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.200
Picking on Ellen isn't helping
anyone.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.880
Then, let's work on this together,
Darrell, we can find out

05:02.880 --> 05:05.720
what's really been happening.
We can and we will. But right now

05:05.720 --> 05:08.280
we need to concentrate on the quiz,
support the school.

05:26.720 --> 05:31.120
Stop staring at her. You know,
she wasn't there when we went

05:31.120 --> 05:33.600
swimming, the day
Irene's hairclip went missing.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.800
Yes, she was. No, she came late.
BELL RINGS

05:35.800 --> 05:39.200
Very well, girls, you can go
to lunch, but I hope the quiz team

05:39.200 --> 05:41.080
is already prepping for tomorrow.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.600
They prepare some tough questions,
but I have every faith in you.

05:49.320 --> 05:51.760
I wonder where she was when
Georgina's mirror went missing.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.320
Why don't we check my diary?
I always write down what I did

05:54.320 --> 05:57.120
and who with. Then, if I can prove
that Ellen WAS with us,

05:57.120 --> 06:00.040
then we'll be able to get on
preparing for the quiz. Deal.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.440
Ellen.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.200
I wonder if I might be excused
from the quiz team.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.320
We've been through this!
Your class needs you.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.880
Well, I just think it would be
better if you ask someone else.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.320
I'm still weak in Latin,
French and history.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.200
Let me be candid with you.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.080
When I was training at Thackerton
College, the boys there were...

06:35.320 --> 06:39.440
..an arrogant little bunch
of...so-and-sos.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.920
Oh. They had no respect for me,
a trainee,

06:41.920 --> 06:45.200
they pushed the very limits
of acceptable behaviour.

06:45.200 --> 06:50.120
But my point is that I want
Malory Towers to thrash them.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.760
They'll be expecting to walk
all over you,

06:52.760 --> 06:56.640
but you're every bit as smart
as the best of them. Really? Yes!

06:56.640 --> 06:58.000
And you won't be alone.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.440
The other girls will look out
for you.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.600
I'm sure you're going to do
this school very proud.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.240
So was I right?

07:17.240 --> 07:20.080
Ellen didn't come
to the pool till later on.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.720
It was a lovely day, but she just

07:21.720 --> 07:23.880
sat on the side with her feet
in the water.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.320
What's going on?

07:27.520 --> 07:30.280
Have you noticed how Ellen
is always sneaking off alone?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.240
She likes her own company.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.240
Darrell's got proof that whenever
things go missing, Ellen is nowhere

07:35.240 --> 07:37.440
to be seen. But that doesn't
make her a thief.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.120
She's always up here revising,
or so she says.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.080
Do you believe this, Darrell? I
don't know. It's not like we follow

07:43.080 --> 07:45.680
her around all the time. I just want
us to get ready for the quiz.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.800
I think we should ask Ellen to
explain where she was

07:47.800 --> 07:50.080
the days things went missing.
Alicia, as Head of Form,

07:50.080 --> 07:52.640
I forbid you from talking about this
until I've had a chance

07:52.640 --> 07:53.920
to look into it.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.480
So, the rules. Once you ring
the bell, you have to answer

08:10.480 --> 08:13.240
the question. Do it before Mr
Parker's finished asking, and

08:13.240 --> 08:15.240
he won't complete it.
Give the wrong answer,

08:15.240 --> 08:16.680
and the other team wins a penalty.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.760
We wouldn't want them
stealing our points.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.200
You can confer, but only
before you ring the bell.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.320
What if we disagree on what the
right answer is? Then, as captain,

08:24.320 --> 08:26.320
I will make the final decision.
But we're a team -

08:26.320 --> 08:28.280
we have to trust each other.
Yeah, right!

08:28.280 --> 08:30.120
Just leave her alone, will you?

08:31.160 --> 08:32.600
What are you all talking about?

08:34.760 --> 08:36.400
You're stealing from us.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.920
You think I'm the thief?!
She's being silly, ignore her.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.400
Is this because I don't laugh
at all your pranks, Alicia?

08:42.400 --> 08:44.920
No, it's because we trusted you
when we shouldn't have.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.920
I wouldn't do something like that!
I swear, I never stole anything.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.320
I know you didn't.
That's not what WE think.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.560
Is it, Darrell? Alicia,
Sally told you to be quiet

08:52.560 --> 08:55.080
because it's not fair
to accuse anyone without proof.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.880
So, for now, Ellen is still part
of this team.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.360
I'm not feeling well.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.840
That was mean. I just wanted us
to hear what she had to say.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.840
KNOCK AT DOOR

09:18.280 --> 09:20.840
Come in.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.960
Ellen! How can I help?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.920
I can't be on the quiz team.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.560
Why ever not?

09:27.560 --> 09:30.040
Because the girls hate me.
They know I don't belong there.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.520
If I let them down tomorrow,
it will just prove them right.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.520
You've just as much right
to be there as any of them.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.000
You're one of the smartest,
hardest-working students we have.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.320
This quiz will be the perfect way
for you to win the respect

09:42.320 --> 09:43.920
of the other girls.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.920
Please give my place on the team
to someone else.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.720
Why don't you sleep on it?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.960
I'm sure once you've had a good
night's rest,

09:50.960 --> 09:53.840
you'll feel differently.
Come and see me in the morning.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.400
Ellen, what are you doing?!

11:46.400 --> 11:47.960
You ARE the thief!

11:47.960 --> 11:50.480
No! This is not what it looks like.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.160
I didn't want to believe Alicia,
but she was right.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.080
I'm not the thief. I promise,
I wouldn't steal your things.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.640
Then, what are you doing
going through Mr Parker's drawer

11:58.640 --> 11:59.920
in the middle of the night?!

12:00.920 --> 12:03.000
I—I was just... Just what?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.400
Just...
You have to tell Miss Grayling.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.160
I can't! If you don't,
then I will!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.000
Darrell...

12:21.920 --> 12:24.080
KNOCKS QUIETLY

12:24.080 --> 12:26.200
SHE SOBS

12:50.920 --> 12:53.000
Ellen?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.880
What are you doing out of bed?

12:58.280 --> 13:01.560
I need to see Miss Grayling.
It's the middle of the night.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.880
She's not there.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.080
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.920
Come on, let's get you to Matron.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.640
Please, Ellen, what's the matter?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.200
Ellen?

13:38.440 --> 13:40.400
What time is the quiz?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.920
I don't think Ellen's coming.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.800
Perhaps she's been arrested?

13:48.800 --> 13:50.640
Can we just focus, please?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.320
Where did she sleep last night?

13:52.320 --> 13:55.520
Ah, here you are.
I have a message from Miss Grayling.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.840
Unfortunately, Ellen is unable
to attend the quiz.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.320
Is she all right?

14:00.320 --> 14:03.320
I'm afraid I can't discuss
her personal situation with you.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.680
So I've decided that

14:05.680 --> 14:08.400
Irene will replace her
in the quiz team.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.160
Uh, that's not a very good idea.
What nonsense!

14:11.160 --> 14:14.520
You have a unique way of looking at
the world, which you can bring

14:14.520 --> 14:17.520
to the team. I'd rather bring not
being there to the team,

14:17.520 --> 14:19.480
for their sake.
She's got no time to practise.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.120
The boys will be here any minute.
Oh, details, details!

14:22.120 --> 14:23.440
Good luck, girls.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.760
What happened to Ellen?
She must be ill.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.480
I know what's going on.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.560
I caught her going through
Mr Parker's drawer

14:33.560 --> 14:36.480
in the middle of the night.
What? What did she take?

14:36.480 --> 14:39.160
His pen. I caught her red-handed,
and I insisted that she go

14:39.160 --> 14:40.720
to tell Miss Grayling about it.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.960
I just wanted to find out
who's stealing from us.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.280
It wasn't personal.
Sorry?! Ellen is the thief?!

14:46.280 --> 14:48.280
It can't be true.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.600
Sorry! Mustn't be late!

15:12.280 --> 15:14.760
Rickety old pile, isn't it?
It's really very shabby.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.360
No wonder they're putting it
out to pasture!

15:19.040 --> 15:21.680
Well, well, boys,
look who it is!

15:21.680 --> 15:23.160
Boys, come on.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.440
We are in so much trouble.
Good luck.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.040
Look, for the next couple of hours,

15:30.040 --> 15:32.600
we have to put what happened
with Ellen aside. Agreed?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.960
Agreed.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.440
I hope she's all right.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.440
Ha, it's old Nosy Parker!
Boys!

15:39.440 --> 15:41.000
How good to see you again.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.320
We would have thought you'd quit
this teacher lark,

15:43.320 --> 15:46.760
after all the fun and games
the Thackerton boys had with you!

15:46.760 --> 15:49.640
Teaching here is very rewarding,
as it happens.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.800
Right. Oh, right.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.920
If you could take your seats.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.840
Who's in charge here?
Me - Darrell Rivers.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.120
Sebastian Fairweather.
Good luck. May the best man win.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.200
Shame you're just a boy, then.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.920
CHUCKLING

16:05.920 --> 16:09.760
Huh, Malory Towers! We have this.
MR PARKER CLEARS HIS THROAT

16:09.760 --> 16:12.720
Thank you, all,
for coming to this local derby.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.720
The boys from Thackerton College
are the reigning champions...

16:15.720 --> 16:18.520
As always. ..but perhaps this year
they've met their match.

16:18.520 --> 16:23.520
We start with a general knowledge
round, so ready on those bells.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.880
You press it AFTER I've asked
the question, Irene.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.000
Sorry. Sorry.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.960
It's all right.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.080
Who painted the Mona Lisa?

16:37.080 --> 16:39.800
BOY: Leonardo da Vinci.
Correct.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.680
What element does Ca denote...?
Calcium.

16:41.680 --> 16:45.200
VOICES OVERLAP

16:41.680 --> 16:45.200
..was the battle...? Correct.

16:41.680 --> 16:45.200
How long is...? Correct.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.720
1066. Correct.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.200
Athelstan... The correct answer
is Mary Shelley.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.600
That's another penalty point.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.880
Arachnophobia is the fear of what?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.240
Spiders?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.080
Henry VIII's first wife...

16:57.080 --> 17:00.120
Catherine of Aragon. I'm afraid you
didn't ring the bell, Jean. Ugh!

17:00.120 --> 17:03.640
Victor. Is it Catherine of Aragon?

17:05.120 --> 17:06.600
Correct.

17:06.600 --> 17:07.800
For pity's sake.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.600
ALL: Yes!

17:09.600 --> 17:11.680
How many...?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.360
A very early ring there,
Darrell.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.200
I can't complete the question,
so...how many?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.080
Seven.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.840
The question was,
how many loaves in a baker's dozen?

17:26.840 --> 17:28.960
The answer was... 13.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.760
That's another penalty point.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.600
Great work, team.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.960
Maybe you could try answering
some questions

17:34.960 --> 17:37.000
instead of criticising
the rest of us.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.160
Name a secondary colour.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.920
What is a young swan called?

17:40.920 --> 17:42.480
Cygnet. Correct.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.920
Who wrote Jane Eyre?

17:47.200 --> 17:48.800
Charlotte Bronte.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.400
Correct!

17:50.400 --> 17:51.960
Um...

17:51.960 --> 17:54.480
Next question. Which Shakespeare

17:54.480 --> 17:56.280
play did Ariel appear in?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.680
I know this! Great! What is it?

17:59.680 --> 18:00.960
IRENE HUMS

18:00.960 --> 18:03.560
What are you doing?
What is she doing?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.880
WHISPERS: I know it, I know it...

18:05.880 --> 18:07.800
It's how she remembers things.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.320
She links them to a piece of music.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.400
ANy answers?

18:12.400 --> 18:13.440
Irene.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.760
Hamlet. No.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.400
Oh, possibly Romeo And Juliet.
I have to take your first answer.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.080
A Midsummer Night's Dream.
The horse has already bolted, Irene.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.200
That's another penalty point.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.480
The correct answer was The Tempest.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.040
It was on the tip of my tongue.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.640
So, our final question

18:39.640 --> 18:41.920
before the break. We have this.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.840
Which is the longest river

18:43.840 --> 18:45.560
in the world?

18:48.520 --> 18:50.440
WHISPERING

18:53.360 --> 18:55.240
Please.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.400
The Amazon. The Nile.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.080
The Amazon.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.240
The correct answer is the Nile.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.840
So, the scores at half-time are

19:05.840 --> 19:09.200
39 versus 19, to Thackerton College.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.960
They're never going to win.
They can't keep up with us.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.040
Did you get it?

19:20.040 --> 19:23.880
"Hello, Ron. It's good to see you.
How are you today?"

19:23.880 --> 19:26.160
I don't have time for niceties.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.880
I managed to get into the village
this morning.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.480
Here you go. And you promise
you won't tell the others,

19:32.480 --> 19:36.680
even if they ask or make up a story
to try and trick you?

19:36.680 --> 19:38.440
They'll think me so silly.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.840
I've got better things
to talk about.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.560
Be seeing you, then.

19:42.560 --> 19:47.080
Uh, yes. Have a good day doing...
whatever it is you do.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.720
We need a new strategy.
We could start

19:56.720 --> 19:58.920
by answering some questions
correctly.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.600
The first new rule is no criticising
each other - it's not helping.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.400
If Ellen was here, she would have
known those questions about trees.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.240
Well, she's not, so we'll just
have to focus on what we CAN do.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.520
Giving away penalty points
all over the place.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.280
If we're going to win,
we need to be much more disciplined.

20:12.280 --> 20:16.640
So I propose that we confer
on every question, but I'll press

20:16.640 --> 20:19.720
the bell and answer for everyone.
Agreed?

20:19.720 --> 20:22.000
They're coming over.
I heard this school is closing.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.960
I wouldn't believe the rumours.
Pater told me, and he's never wrong.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.320
Well, this time your father is.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.280
If the school is closing, maybe
you can spend your time doing

20:29.280 --> 20:31.320
something more suitable,

20:31.320 --> 20:33.080
like cooking or sewing?

20:33.080 --> 20:36.120
And you can carry on being smug
for no good reason that I can see.

20:36.120 --> 20:40.360
If you could take your seats,
please, teams.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.000
Boo!

20:40.360 --> 20:43.000
BOYS LAUGH

20:43.000 --> 20:46.280
We've GOT to beat them. For once,
I completely agree with you.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.880
So we move on to a round about
the natural world.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.800
Which is the only country
lemurs are found in?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.520
BELL

20:59.800 --> 21:01.520
Darrell.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.880
Madagascar. Correct.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.520
What is the name given
to the berries on a rosebush?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.160
WHISPERS: Rosehips.
Rosehips.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.640
Correct. Well done, Jean!

21:19.240 --> 21:20.720
Yes!

21:20.720 --> 21:23.200
How many ribs...? 24.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.360
VOICES OVERLAP

21:23.200 --> 21:25.360
Correct! What...? Correct.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.880
..chestnut tree? Conkers.
Correct.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.280
The Titanic. Correct.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.600
What is the capital of Canada?

21:32.600 --> 21:35.040
Ottawa. Ottawa.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.600
Correct.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.840
How many symphonies did Mozart...?
BELL

21:48.840 --> 21:50.840
41. Correct!

21:50.840 --> 21:54.000
Mozart did indeed write
41 symphonies.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.320
Final question.

21:56.320 --> 22:00.240
We end the music round with
a question on Gregorian chant.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.840
Gregorian chant? Who is usually
regarded

22:02.840 --> 22:05.480
as the founder of Gregorian chant?

22:05.480 --> 22:08.320
Irene, this is a question
in your specialist subject.

22:08.320 --> 22:09.720
Yes, I know.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.160
SHE HUMS

22:11.240 --> 22:13.160
Not this again.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.040
What is it? If there are no takers,
I will have to ask

22:16.040 --> 22:18.480
a different question.

22:18.480 --> 22:23.240
WHISPERS: Pope Gregory I.
Pope Gregory I. Pope Gregory I.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.920
Yes!

22:24.920 --> 22:26.840
Pope Gregory I.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.360
Is the right answer!

22:33.360 --> 22:35.200
I declare Malory Towers

22:35.200 --> 22:36.880
this year's winners.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.400
Well done!

22:43.680 --> 22:44.720
CHEERING

22:48.280 --> 22:50.520
Excellent work, girls. Well done.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.240
Well, that showed them!
It certainly did!

22:56.640 --> 22:58.080
Sebastian?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.800
Well played.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.880
You too.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.080
Well, a team full of girls.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.040
Who'd have thought?

23:10.480 --> 23:12.320
Who'd have thought?!

23:22.080 --> 23:23.600
You saved the day!

23:27.160 --> 23:28.480
It was great!

23:35.080 --> 23:37.680
Gwen, you got your brush back.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.240
It was so important to Mother, so
I asked Ron to buy it back for me.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.880
Did he ask who'd sold it? He did,
but the jeweller couldn't remember.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.880
Was it a Malory Towers girl? Alicia,

23:46.880 --> 23:49.680
as far as I'm aware, this is an end
to the matter.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.760
We found the thief,

23:50.760 --> 23:53.600
so I really don't want to hear
another word about it.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.520
If you're sure.
Um, everybody, come.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.160
I just want to say,
well done, Malory Towers!

23:59.160 --> 24:01.040
Hip, hip...
ALL: Hooray!

24:01.040 --> 24:03.120
Hip, hip...
ALL: Hooray!

24:03.120 --> 24:05.040
Jean, are you all right?

24:08.360 --> 24:10.480
I haven't seen Ellen since
yesterday.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.640
Do you think
they could have expelled her?

24:14.280 --> 24:17.240
Does that mean
we'll never see her again?

24:19.480 --> 24:21.600
Come on, let's get ready for class.
