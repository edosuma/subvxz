WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:08.779
- PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...
- DANNY DESAI HAS FLED.

00:08.779 --> 00:10.541
I THINK VIKRAM
MIGHT BE ALIVE.

00:10.541 --> 00:12.383
NOTHING VIKRAM
EVER DID SURPRISED ME.

00:12.383 --> 00:15.546
I'M CHARLIE McBRIDE.
I START MID-TERM TOMORROW
AT GREEN GROVE HIGH.

00:15.546 --> 00:18.219
- SO I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.
- YEAH. I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.691
- DO YOU REALLY
CARE ABOUT VIKRAM?
- HE'S MY HUSBAND.

00:20.691 --> 00:22.293
HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

00:22.293 --> 00:24.024
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.656
- I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.
- RICO.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.801
DANNY'S PRINTS ARE NOT
ON THAT MURDER WEAPON.

00:30.801 --> 00:32.563
AND ALL ROADS
LEAD TO MARILYN.

00:32.563 --> 00:34.665
MORE LIKE ALL ROADS
LEAD TO VIKRAM.

00:34.665 --> 00:36.737
Danny:
HE MADE ME TAKE
THE BLAME FOR MY AUNT

00:36.737 --> 00:38.669
AND THEN HE FRAMED
FOR REGINA.

00:38.669 --> 00:40.771
EVERYTHING I DID
IS FOR GOOD REASON.

00:40.771 --> 00:43.314
- YOU NEED TO PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME.
- ( beeps )

00:43.314 --> 00:45.246
NO, JO, DON'T--
GET OFF ME!

00:45.246 --> 00:47.278
GIVE ME THAT PHONE!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.050
GET OFF!

00:52.353 --> 00:53.754
( both grunt )

00:59.630 --> 01:02.633
- OH MY GOD.
DANNY, HE'S--
- NO.

01:04.095 --> 01:06.437
- HE IS. OH GOD. OH.
- HEY.

01:06.437 --> 01:08.139
HEY, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME.

01:08.139 --> 01:09.770
ARE YOU OKAY?
DID HE HURT YOU?

01:09.770 --> 01:12.673
- THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
- HE WAS GONNA--

01:12.673 --> 01:14.605
HE WAS GONNA
HURT YOU, OKAY?

01:14.605 --> 01:16.677
- THAT'S--
HE WAS GONNA HURT YOU.
- I KNOW.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.679
I KNOW. I'M OKAY.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.154
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS--
THIS ACTUALLY--

01:23.154 --> 01:25.186
DEAD. HE'S DEAD.

01:26.617 --> 01:28.719
- DANNY.
- I KILLED HIM.

01:28.719 --> 01:30.761
I KILLED HIM, RIGHT?

01:31.792 --> 01:33.394
I KILLED MY OWN FATHER.

01:36.267 --> 01:38.269
( theme music playing )

01:57.618 --> 01:59.250
Jo:
WE SHOULD GO GET HELP.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.153
NO ONE CAN HELP US.

02:03.854 --> 02:06.657
MY DAD CAN.
THE POLICE C--

02:06.657 --> 02:08.859
THE POLICE ARE ALREADY
HUNTING ME FOR ONE MURDER.

02:10.661 --> 02:12.363
THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE ME.

02:13.864 --> 02:15.736
I CAN EXPLAIN.

02:16.667 --> 02:19.770
I CAN SAY THAT
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

02:19.770 --> 02:22.673
YOUR DAD WAS
OUT OF HIS MIND

02:22.673 --> 02:24.515
AND THAT YOU WERE
TRYING TO SAVE ME.

02:24.515 --> 02:26.217
AND WHO'S GONNA
BELIEVE YOU?

02:28.619 --> 02:31.682
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
THE WHOLE TOWN KNOWS YOU HAVE--

02:33.284 --> 02:34.825
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

02:42.733 --> 02:44.735
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING I CAN DO.

02:46.937 --> 02:48.369
NO.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.740
I HAVE TO LEAVE
GREEN GROVE FOR GOOD.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.475
- DANNY, THERE HAS
TO BE ANOTHER OPTION.
- NO, THERE'S NOT.

02:54.475 --> 02:58.178
I JUST CAN'T HAVE THIS
RUIN YOUR LIFE, TOO.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.212
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
- OF COURSE I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, JO.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.687
THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.725
I CAN'T KEEP THIS
FROM MY PARENTS.
I'M SORRY.

03:18.469 --> 03:19.930
I HAVE TO TELL THEM.

03:22.233 --> 03:24.675
- I HAVE TO.
- I CAN'T GO TO JAIL.

03:26.437 --> 03:28.279
JO, I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

03:31.582 --> 03:33.514
OKAY, UMM...

03:35.746 --> 03:37.388
I CAN GIVE YOU
A HEAD START.

03:38.949 --> 03:40.851
I'LL GO HOME
AND I WILL PACK A BAG

03:40.851 --> 03:43.694
WITH FOOD, CLOTHES, MONEY
AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED.

03:43.694 --> 03:45.526
- YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
- YEAH, I DO.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.428
I HAVE TO,

03:47.428 --> 03:50.301
SO I'LL BE BACK FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING.

03:51.962 --> 03:53.734
YOU'LL STILL BE HERE, RIGHT?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.509
SAY YOU'LL STILL BE HERE.

04:00.411 --> 04:01.742
I'LL STILL BE HERE.

04:16.727 --> 04:18.759
( Lacey sighs )

04:18.759 --> 04:21.492
- MAYBE SHE WENT TO BED.
- IT'S NOT EVEN THAT LATE.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.963
I DON'T KNOW.
STRESS MAKES JO SLEEPY.

04:24.895 --> 04:26.937
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE KNOWS WHERE DANNY WENT?

04:26.937 --> 04:28.999
I JUST HOPE HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

04:28.999 --> 04:32.703
HE'LL BE FINE.
HE'S SUPER AGILE AND CRAFTY

04:32.703 --> 04:35.005
AND HE HAS THAT
LONG, THICK HAIR, SO...

04:36.847 --> 04:38.909
THAT'LL KEEP HIS EARS WARM.

04:38.909 --> 04:41.852
- AS LONG AS HIS EARS ARE WARM.
- COME ON. EVERYTHING IS GONNA
WORK OUT, ALL RIGHT?

04:41.852 --> 04:43.714
CHIEF MASTERSON IS
GONNA SOLVE THE CASE

04:43.714 --> 04:45.616
THEN DANNY'LL COME BACK
AND YOU TWO CAN, YOU KNOW,

04:45.616 --> 04:46.917
SPOON, CUDDLE AND STUFF.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.760
WHAT? NO,
THAT'S NOT EVEN WHY--

04:49.760 --> 04:52.393
I JUST WANNA HELP HIM.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.625
- YEAH.
- I HAVE TO TALK
TO GLORIA CRANE.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.367
SHE KNOWS SOMETHING ELSE.
I'M SURE OF IT.

04:56.367 --> 04:58.929
WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S STANDING
NEXT TO DANNY'S DAD
IN A FEW PICTURES?

04:58.929 --> 05:00.701
MAYBE HE'S JUST
REALLY INTO HORSES.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.704
OR MAYBE GLORIA KNEW
WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN
REGINA AND VIKRAM.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.836
OKAY, BUT IF
SHE KNEW ANYTHING,

05:05.836 --> 05:07.738
WHY WOULDN'T SHE HAVE
JUST TOLD THE COPS?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.512
THAT'S WHAT
I NEED TO FIND OUT.

05:21.752 --> 05:24.495
( door opens, closes )

05:26.597 --> 05:27.728
JO.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.430
HOLD ON A SECOND.

05:30.661 --> 05:31.902
MOM, HEY.

05:31.902 --> 05:34.405
I WAS JUST--
WHAT'S UP?

05:34.405 --> 05:36.807
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
- JUST OUT, WALKING AROUND.

05:36.807 --> 05:38.869
I GUESS I JUST
LOST TRACK OF TIME.
I'M SORRY.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.872
I WAS WORRIED, HONEY.
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE ON EDGE

05:41.872 --> 05:43.974
- WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENING.
- I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.517
I'M GONNA
GO TO BED, OKAY?

06:05.135 --> 06:07.398
( breathing heavily )

06:16.146 --> 06:18.148
( crying )

06:22.613 --> 06:25.556
- ( people chattering )
- SO WHAT DID MAYOR ROLLINS SAY?

06:25.556 --> 06:27.688
HE INSISTED ALBANY
SENT MARILYN TO HIM,

06:27.688 --> 06:28.819
CLAIMED HE NEVER
EVEN KNEW HER.

06:28.819 --> 06:30.621
- SEEMED A LITTLE CONVENIENT.
- A LITTLE?

06:30.621 --> 06:31.792
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE, LISTEN UP!

06:31.792 --> 06:34.394
FINDING MARILYN ROSSI
IS NOW OUR TOP PRIORITY.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.497
I WANT YOU TO TRACK HER PHONE,
TRACK HER COMPUTER.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.828
I WANT YOU TO ALERT
THE STATE TROOPERS,

06:37.828 --> 06:39.600
- LET THEM KNOW ALL THE--
- IS THIS ABOUT DANNY?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.802
- KAREN, I'M RIGHT IN--
- DID YOU FIND HIM?

06:44.404 --> 06:47.978
NOT YET, BUT WE'RE LOOKING
FOR MARILYN ROSSI NOW.

06:47.978 --> 06:50.781
SHE DISAPPEARED
FROM HER MOTEL ROOM
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO.

06:50.781 --> 06:53.013
SO THAT CONFIRMS THAT
SHE WAS SETTING DANNY UP.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.445
RIGHT?

06:55.686 --> 06:57.718
- I'M SORRY, YOU ARE...?
- JACK TAYLOR.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.890
JACK'S AN OLD FRIEND.
KYLE, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

06:59.890 --> 07:02.623
- WHY WOULD SHE RUN?
- YOUR OLD FRIEND IS RIGHT.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.825
SHE FALSIFIED THAT EVIDENCE.
WE HAVE PROOF SHE ALTERED IT,

07:04.825 --> 07:07.698
FORGED THE REPORT.
THAT PIPE WASN'T EVEN
A REAL MURDER WEAPON.

07:07.698 --> 07:09.930
- DANNY'S PRINTS
WERE NOWHERE ON IT.
- HE'S STILL OUT THERE ALONE,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.462
TERRIFIED,
THINKING YOU'RE AFTER HIM.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.734
I KNOW, BUT WE HAVE
TO FIND MARILYN FIRST.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.737
THE ONLY REASON
SHE'D FRAME DANNY IS
TO COVER FOR HERSELF...

07:16.737 --> 07:18.839
OR FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.743
AND THAT SOMEONE ELSE
YOU STILL THINK IS VIKRAM.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.779
THESE-- THESE ARE
SOME OF VIKRAM'S THINGS.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.784
- I USED TO WORK FOR HIM.
- JACK TOOK CARE OF VIK'S BOAT.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.656
HE FOUND HIS THINGS
THAT HE'D LEFT BEHIND--

07:35.656 --> 07:36.927
SOME FILES, SOME DISKS.
I DON'T KNOW.

07:36.927 --> 07:38.789
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD
HELP YOU TRACK HIM DOWN.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.591
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

07:40.591 --> 07:42.763
WELL, TELL ME
WHAT ELSE I CAN DO.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.165
NOTHING. GO HOME.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.467
I CAN'T JUST
SIT AROUND WAITING.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.501
YES, YOU CAN.
AND IF DANNY CONTACTS YOU,

07:50.501 --> 07:52.903
TELL HIM TO COME BACK,
TELL HIM I'LL PROTECT HIM.

07:52.903 --> 07:53.844
OKAY.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.657
( knocks on door )

08:06.657 --> 08:08.689
( loudly )
UH, JUST A SECOND, MOM.

08:14.665 --> 08:17.528
UM, OKAY.

08:17.528 --> 08:19.600
SORRY, IT'S-- IT'S ME.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.533
- OH.
- CAN I COME IN?

08:22.533 --> 08:24.134
UM, YEAH.

08:29.079 --> 08:32.082
- WHAT ARE YOU--
- I JUST WANTED TO
MAKE SURE YOU WERE OKAY

08:32.082 --> 08:36.687
AFTER ALL OF OUR
FUGITIVE-HARBORING
SHENANIGANS, SO...

08:38.789 --> 08:40.150
YOUR MOM SAID
YOU JUST GOT HOME,

08:40.150 --> 08:41.822
SO I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS BOTHERING YOU.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.954
BUT IF I AM, I CAN--
I CAN LEAVE.

08:43.954 --> 08:46.156
NO, RICO.
IT'S FINE.

08:46.156 --> 08:48.859
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S JUST BEEN
A LONG DAY, SO...

08:50.160 --> 08:51.732
SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.064
LACEY AND I HAVE BEEN
TRYING YOU ALL NIGHT.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.866
SORRY ABOUT THAT, IT DIED.

08:55.866 --> 08:59.269
I MEAN, THE BATTERY--
I NEED TO CHARGE IT.

08:59.269 --> 09:01.171
THAT'S COOL.

09:01.171 --> 09:02.843
LACEY IS WONDERING
IF YOU KNEW WHERE DANNY WENT.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.075
- SHE'S PRETTY WORRIED
ABOUT HIM.
- HE'S FINE.

09:05.075 --> 09:07.177
OH, SO YOU DO KNOW
WHERE HE IS?

09:07.177 --> 09:10.180
I MEAN,
I'M SURE HE'S FINE,
'CAUSE HE'S DANNY.

09:10.180 --> 09:13.153
RIGHT. OKAY.
THAT'S WHAT I--
WHAT I TOLD HER.

09:14.284 --> 09:15.626
I HOPE WE'RE RIGHT.

09:15.626 --> 09:16.927
I KEEP THINKING MAYBE
I MADE A MISTAKE,

09:16.927 --> 09:18.929
LIKE MAYBE--
I DON'T KNOW--

09:18.929 --> 09:21.061
I SHOULD'VE JUST CALLED
THE COPS WHEN HE FIRST
SHOWED UP AT MY PLACE.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.834
- NO, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
- YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT I DID.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.796
BUT NOW I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT AND IT'S LIKE,

09:25.796 --> 09:27.798
WE'RE ALL JUST KIDS,
EVEN DANNY.

09:27.798 --> 09:30.801
HE SEEMS A LOT
OLDER BECAUSE HE WAS
A PRISONER AND STUFF,

09:30.801 --> 09:33.744
BUT RUNNING AND HIDING
FROM THE POLICE IS NUTS.

09:33.744 --> 09:35.345
I DON'T KNOW HOW
HE'S SUPPOSED TO
HANDLE THAT BY HIMSELF.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.648
I CAN BARELY HANDLE
THE CHEMISTRY QUIZ
WE HAVE THIS WEEK,

09:37.648 --> 09:39.610
AND THAT'S ONLY LIKE
HALF AS SCARY.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.912
YEAH, I HAVEN'T STUDIED
FOR THAT THING AT ALL.

09:43.253 --> 09:44.885
YEAH.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.159
WELL, I SHOULD--
I SHOULD GO.

09:49.159 --> 09:51.191
OKAY. UMM...

09:52.623 --> 09:54.224
THANK YOU
FOR CHECKING ON ME.

10:18.288 --> 10:19.720
DANNY?

10:23.754 --> 10:25.195
DANNY, IT'S ME.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.299
DANNY, I...

10:30.300 --> 10:32.332
( door creaks )

10:34.004 --> 10:36.036
HEY.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.839
- I WAS WORRIED
THAT YOU'D ALREADY--
- I'M NOT GONNA RUN.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.913
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT
AND I CAN'T LEAVE.

10:44.114 --> 10:45.846
HOW COULD I NOT SEE
MY MOTHER AGAIN?

10:45.846 --> 10:47.818
OR LACEY? OR YOU?

10:47.818 --> 10:50.951
YEAH, I KINDA REALIZED
THE SAME THING.

10:50.951 --> 10:54.755
FLEEING IS NOT
THE BEST PLAN.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.857
PLUS I DON'T THINK
YOUR CLOTHES WOULD
FIT ME ALL TOO WELL.

10:59.830 --> 11:03.864
OKAY, SO IF YOU'RE
NOT RUNNING, THEN--

11:03.864 --> 11:07.798
I'M GOING BACK, RIGHT NOW,
AND I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
ALL OF IT.

11:09.199 --> 11:12.873
OKAY. I'LL BE WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.905
- WE'LL TELL
THE POLICE TOGETHER.
- WE'RE NOT TELLING THE POLICE.

11:16.707 --> 11:19.850
WE'RE TELLING THE ONE PERSON
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP US--

11:19.850 --> 11:20.781
YOUR DAD.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.284
WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCES.

11:35.465 --> 11:37.197
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

11:39.369 --> 11:42.032
EVERYONE'S TREATED ME
LIKE A KILLER FOR SO LONG.

11:42.032 --> 11:44.074
- NOW--
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, DANNY.

11:44.074 --> 11:45.235
I STILL DID IT.

11:46.236 --> 11:47.707
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

11:47.707 --> 11:52.182
HE WAS GONNA HURT YOU.
HE WANTED TO HURT BOTH OF US.

11:52.182 --> 11:54.044
AND I WANTED
TO HURT HIM, TOO.

11:57.287 --> 11:59.349
I WAS SO ANGRY.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.024
AND A PART OF ME--

12:04.024 --> 12:06.957
I THINK IN THAT MOMENT
A PART OF ME JUST
WANTED HIM TO DIE.

12:11.261 --> 12:12.833
WELL, I DON'T BLAME YOU.

12:14.404 --> 12:17.337
I GUESS WE'LL SEE
IF OTHER PEOPLE FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.940
THEY WILL.
THEY HAVE TO.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.313
THE THINGS
THAT HE DID TO YOU, DANNY.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.818
I WONDER IF ANYTHING
WAS REAL WITH HIM.

12:27.818 --> 12:29.379
YOU KNOW? LIKE...

12:31.451 --> 12:32.883
MAYBE HE NEVER LOVED ME.

12:32.883 --> 12:35.485
MAYBE HE WASN'T CAPABLE
OF LOVING ANYONE.

12:35.485 --> 12:39.429
SOCIOPATHS DON'T CARE
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE, REMEMBER?

12:45.335 --> 12:47.167
I GUESS
I'LL JUST NEVER KNOW.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.841
I'LL-- I'LL NEVER KNOW
WHY HE KILLED TARA.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.073
WELL, WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.805
THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS, OKAY?

12:54.805 --> 12:57.777
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
ON QUESTIONS

12:57.777 --> 12:59.910
THAT YOU MAY NEVER
BE ABLE TO ANSWER.

12:59.910 --> 13:02.352
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
HE'S NOT WORTH IT.

13:07.157 --> 13:09.119
( doorbell chimes )

13:18.098 --> 13:20.270
- HEY.
- HEY.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.874
JUST WANTED
TO SEE HOW YOU WERE.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.278
WELL, I'M FINE.

13:29.279 --> 13:31.411
GOOD. OKAY.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.886
- YOU SLEEP AT ALL LAST NIGHT?
- NOT REALLY.

13:35.886 --> 13:39.149
I-- I JUST KEEP WONDERING
IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN DO.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.820
THERE ISN'T.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.453
- LET THE POLICE DO THEIR JOB.
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

13:43.453 --> 13:47.497
I OVERLOOKED VIKRAM'S--
WELL, HIS FLAWS FOR YEARS

13:47.497 --> 13:51.001
- AND NOW--
- HEY HEY HEY, YOU DID
THE BEST YOU COULD.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.863
YOU'RE A GREAT MOM.

13:54.464 --> 13:57.908
AND YOU'RE A SMART,
AMAZING WOMAN.

14:01.171 --> 14:02.442
VIKRAM NEVER DESERVED YOU.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.977
YOU NEED TO BE WITH SOMEONE
WHO APPRECIATES YOU.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.223
JACK, DON'T. OKAY?

14:13.223 --> 14:15.455
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
I CAN'T DO THIS.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.627
HEY, YOU CAME TO ME
FOR A REASON.

14:17.627 --> 14:19.259
YEAH, I NEEDED YOUR HELP.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.192
I THINK YOU MISS ME.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.236
I MISS MY SON...

14:27.397 --> 14:30.240
- AND I JUST WANT HIM BACK.
- I KNOW.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.374
I'M SORRY. I, UH--

14:34.374 --> 14:36.076
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.108
- ( door opens )
- OKAY.

14:39.409 --> 14:41.151
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

14:52.062 --> 14:54.064
- ( police radio chatter )
- ( people chattering )

15:13.343 --> 15:15.615
( clicks )

15:17.017 --> 15:19.019
( keyboard clicking )

15:20.290 --> 15:22.522
HEY, JUST SPOKE
TO THE STATE TROOPERS,

15:22.522 --> 15:26.656
STILL NO SIGN
OF MISS ROSSI'S VEHICLE
ON ANY MAJOR ROAD,

15:26.656 --> 15:29.329
HIGHWAY, OUTER SPACE.

15:29.329 --> 15:33.133
- CHIEF, ARE YOU LISTENING?
- HEY, EDDIE, COME HERE.
CHECK THIS OUT.

15:37.607 --> 15:40.510
- Eddie: ARTICLES
OF INCORPORATION...
- Kyle: FOR MARNA, INC.

15:40.510 --> 15:42.572
- JUST READ THE BOTTOM.
- ( mouse clicks )

15:42.572 --> 15:45.115
Eddie:
SIGNED BY
VIKRAM DESAI AND...

15:45.115 --> 15:48.979
MAYOR JOHN ROLLINS.
( sighs )

15:48.979 --> 15:53.483
HE LIED. HE HAD TO HAVE
KNOWN THAT MARILYN WORKED
FOR VIKRAM WHEN HE HIRED HER.

15:57.327 --> 15:58.588
SO NICE OF YOU
TO STOP BY, LACEY.

15:58.588 --> 15:59.729
ARE YOU GONNA STAY
AND WATCH THE SHOW?

15:59.729 --> 16:01.391
I CAN GET YOU
A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

16:01.391 --> 16:03.593
ACTUALLY, I WAS KIND OF
THINKING OF STAYING
BACK HERE WITH YOU,

16:03.593 --> 16:06.466
- MAYBE HELPING OUT A BIT.
- WELL, WE CAN ALWAYS
USE SOME HELP.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.637
GO FIND ELAINE.
SHE'LL PUT YOU TO WORK.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.199
OKAY.

16:11.441 --> 16:14.374
LACEY PORTER,
ARE YOU STALKING ME?

16:14.374 --> 16:17.707
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
THAT THIS QUALIFIES
AS OFFICIAL STALKING.

16:17.707 --> 16:20.080
FINE, STALKING ADJACENT...

16:20.080 --> 16:22.712
UNLESS YOU'RE HERE TO TRY
AND GRILL THE BOSS LADY.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.554
NO GRILLING,
JUST LIGHT CHATTING.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.717
SURE, SURE, LIGHT CHATTING
ABOUT YOUR BUDDY DANNY

16:27.717 --> 16:30.220
BEING ACCUSED OF MURDERING
MRS. CRANE'S DAUGHTER.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.062
( horse neighs )

16:32.062 --> 16:34.024
I TOLD YOU DANNY
DIDN'T MURDER ANYONE.

16:34.024 --> 16:35.365
EXCEPT HIS AUNT, RIGHT?

16:36.526 --> 16:38.768
I DID A LITTLE
INTERNET BROWSING LAST NIGHT.

16:38.768 --> 16:42.472
GREEN GROVE
IS NOT AS IDYLLIC
AS IT LOOKS, HUH?

16:42.472 --> 16:44.404
WHATEVER. I SHOULD'VE
NEVER TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.136
YEAH, BUT SEE, THE THING IS
I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD

16:46.136 --> 16:48.238
AT GETTING PEOPLE
TO OPEN UP TO ME.

16:48.238 --> 16:51.381
I COULD HELP YOU
WITH THE BOSS LADY
IF YOU WANT, BUTTER HER UP.

16:51.381 --> 16:53.313
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

16:53.313 --> 16:55.585
I SAY THAT SADDLE
LOOKS PRETTY HEAVY.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.317
YOU SHOULD
KEEP ON MOVING.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.751
WHAT? WHAT,
THIS LITTLE THING?
IT'S LIGHT AS A FEATHER.

17:01.751 --> 17:04.224
SURE. SURE.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.325
( chuckles )

17:10.100 --> 17:11.661
Tess:
THIS IS MY THIRD MESSAGE.
I'M NOT SURE

17:11.661 --> 17:13.403
- WHY YOU REFUSE
TO PICK UP YOUR PHO--
- ( door opens )

17:13.403 --> 17:15.235
MOM.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.407
- ( beeps )
- OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:17.407 --> 17:20.340
I WOKE UP AND YOU WERE GONE.
YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.773
HEY, MRS. MASTERSON.

17:23.773 --> 17:25.445
DANNY.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.547
OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

17:27.547 --> 17:31.281
EVERYONE'S BEEN
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

17:31.281 --> 17:32.622
I'M GONNA CALL
YOUR MOTHER RIGHT NOW.

17:32.622 --> 17:34.324
- MOM, WAIT.
- WAIT.

17:34.324 --> 17:37.787
- WE NEED TO TALK TO DAD.
- IT'S-- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

17:37.787 --> 17:39.629
CAN YOU CALL HIM
AND ASK HIM TO COME HOME?

17:39.629 --> 17:44.234
HE'S OFF LOOKING
FOR THAT INVESTIGATOR,
MARILYN ROSSI.

17:44.234 --> 17:46.596
HE HAS PROOF THAT SHE FAKED
THAT EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU.

17:46.596 --> 17:48.538
HE KNOWS YOU DIDN'T
KILL REGINA, DANNY.

17:48.538 --> 17:50.700
THIS WHOLE ORDEAL
IS ALMOST OVER.

17:57.447 --> 17:59.078
Karen:
I WAS SO WORRIED.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.281
I KNOW, MOM,
BUT I'M OKAY.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.782
YOU MUST'VE BEEN
SO SCARED.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.415
WHERE WERE YOU?
WHERE WERE YOU HIDING?

18:05.415 --> 18:07.757
UHM, IT'S KIND OF
A LONG STORY, SO--

18:07.757 --> 18:09.389
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.720
YOU'RE BACK
AND YOU'RE SAFE.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.193
EVERYTHING WILL
BE OKAY NOW.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.394
I PROMISE.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.873
( sighs )
DID YOU TALK TO KYLE?

18:23.873 --> 18:26.636
- YEAH, HE WAS SO RELIEVED.
- NO THANKS.

18:27.677 --> 18:29.539
HE SAID DANNY SHOULD
KEEP A LOW PROFILE

18:29.539 --> 18:30.880
WHILE HE FIGURES
ALL THIS OUT.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.812
NOTHING ABOUT
THE CASE, MARILYN?

18:34.344 --> 18:36.716
- VIKRAM?
- UH, NO.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.718
BUT HE SOUNDED POSITIVE.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.192
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN YOUR MOM
ACT LIKE THIS BEFORE.

18:42.192 --> 18:43.823
WHAT, HAPPY?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.895
YEAH, I GUESS
THAT'S PRETTY RARE.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.301
WELL, AT LEAST
THEY'RE GETTING A CHANCE
TO ENJOY ALL OF THIS

18:51.301 --> 18:53.733
- BEFORE WE...
- BLOW IT ALL UP?

18:53.733 --> 18:57.737
- YEAH.
- JO, NONE OF THIS
CHANGES ANYTHING

18:57.737 --> 18:59.369
THAT HAPPENED OUT THERE.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.871
REMEMBER THAT.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.813
Karen:
READY TO GO?

19:03.813 --> 19:05.915
NOW? DON'T YOU--

19:05.915 --> 19:08.448
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT WE SHOULD WAIT
FOR CHIEF MASTERSON?

19:08.448 --> 19:10.320
HE SAID I SHOULD KEEP
A LOW PROFILE.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.452
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T TAKE YOU HOME.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.923
COME ON. I'LL MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

19:13.923 --> 19:15.785
YOU CAN SHOWER,
GET SOME REST.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.290
YOU'RE NOT A SUSPECT
ANYMORE, OKAY?

19:20.290 --> 19:22.792
STOP THINKING THAT WAY.
COME ON.

19:25.835 --> 19:27.697
UH, I'LL TALK TO YOU.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.280
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.412
GETTING HIM TO COME BACK
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.416
TELL THE COUNCILMAN
I UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION--

19:46.416 --> 19:48.358
HIS CONSTITUENTS.
I GET IT. BUT WE--

19:48.358 --> 19:49.819
YOU LIED TO ME, JOHN.

19:49.819 --> 19:53.793
( sighs )
EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

19:53.793 --> 19:56.666
( sighs )
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:56.666 --> 19:58.768
YOU AND VIKRAM WERE
BUSINESS PARTNERS?!

20:00.770 --> 20:02.932
- I-- HOLD ON.
- AND WHEN I ASKED YOU
ABOUT MARNA BEFORE,

20:02.932 --> 20:04.504
YOU PRETENDED YOU NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF IT.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.775
- I CAN EXPLAIN.
- YOU BETTER,

20:05.775 --> 20:07.507
BECAUSE MY NEXT STOP
IS THE D.A.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.909
- AND THEN IT GOES PUBLIC.
- JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

20:09.909 --> 20:12.842
NOW LOOK,
THIS THING WITH VIKRAM,

20:12.842 --> 20:14.644
- I KNOW HOW IT LOOKS.
- HOW IT LOOKS?!

20:14.644 --> 20:15.815
IT LOOKS ILLEGAL, JOHN!

20:17.647 --> 20:18.918
NOW WHY'D YOU PUT
MARILYN ON THE CASE?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.890
- DID VIKRAM
SEND HER TO YOU?
- NO, VIKRAM HAD--

20:20.890 --> 20:23.893
WELL, HE AND MARILYN ARE
INVOLVED IN REGINA'S MURDER,

20:23.893 --> 20:25.295
AND I'M STARTING TO THINK
YOU MIGHT BE, TOO.

20:25.295 --> 20:28.758
- WHAT? KYLE, WH--
- TELL ME THE TRUTH!

20:28.758 --> 20:30.260
WHY DID YOU HIRE MARILYN?

20:30.260 --> 20:33.263
THE CASE WAS GETTING
OUT OF HAND, OKAY?

20:33.263 --> 20:34.804
YOU WERE
LOSING FOCUS AND A--

20:36.306 --> 20:38.908
A SILENT PARTNER
AT MARNA SAID THAT
MARILYN COULD HELP,

20:38.908 --> 20:40.870
THAT SHE WAS
TOP NOTCH, THE BEST.

20:40.870 --> 20:44.814
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU,
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THIS
CONNECTION WITH VIKRAM.

20:44.814 --> 20:46.676
WHAT SILENT PARTNER?

20:48.878 --> 20:49.919
GLORIA CRANE.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.884
( horses neighing )

20:56.456 --> 20:57.787
HEY.

20:59.989 --> 21:02.432
YOU WERE ALWAYS SO WILLING
TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY,

21:02.432 --> 21:04.864
EVEN AS A KID.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.537
REGINA, WELL,
SHE NEVER ACTUALLY WANTED
TO TOUCH THE HORSES.

21:07.537 --> 21:10.440
JUST RIDE THEM
ONCE THEY WERE
GROOMED AND READY.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.501
I REMEMBER.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.345
I THINK ABOUT HER
ALL THE TIME.

21:15.345 --> 21:16.946
ME TOO,

21:16.946 --> 21:18.878
ESPECIALLY ON DAYS
LIKE TODAY.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.751
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH--
WITH DANNY ON THE RUN

21:21.751 --> 21:25.385
YES, WELL, HOPEFULLY
THEY'LL FIND HIM SOON

21:25.385 --> 21:26.716
AND WE CAN
ALL GET SOME CLOSURE.

21:26.716 --> 21:29.519
YEAH, I HOPE
THAT'S ENOUGH,
FINDING HIM.

21:29.519 --> 21:30.760
THERE'S STILL
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.323
WELL, IT'S REALLY
VERY SIMPLE, DEAR.

21:33.323 --> 21:35.925
DANNY DESAI IS
A PSYCHOPATHIC KILLER

21:35.925 --> 21:37.367
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:38.668 --> 21:40.299
MRS. CRANE, I KNOW
THAT IT'S EASIER TO BELIEVE

21:40.299 --> 21:41.771
THAT DANNY DID THIS,
BUT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T?

21:41.771 --> 21:43.733
WHAT IF THE WRONG PERSON
GOES TO JAIL

21:43.733 --> 21:44.934
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S MURDER?

21:46.075 --> 21:48.608
WHAT IF VIKRAM
IS INVOLVED?

21:48.608 --> 21:49.779
VIKRAM?

21:50.740 --> 21:52.742
VIKRAM DESAI IS DEAD.

21:52.742 --> 21:54.414
WE DON'T THINK HE IS.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.346
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ELSE,
YOU HAVE TO TELL.

21:56.346 --> 21:59.749
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE POLICE
AND TELL THEM RIGHT NOW.

21:59.749 --> 22:01.691
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU NEED, LACEY?

22:01.691 --> 22:03.723
THERE'S A MURDER WEAPON
WITH HIS FINGERPRINTS ON IT,

22:03.723 --> 22:05.054
HE HAS NO DISCERNABLE ALIBI,

22:05.054 --> 22:07.326
HE FLED WHEN THE POLICE
SHOWED UP AT HIS HOME

22:07.326 --> 22:09.659
- AND HE TOOK HER NECKLACE.
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

22:09.659 --> 22:10.930
THEN WHY WAS IT
IN HIS LOCKER?

22:14.604 --> 22:16.466
I-- I'M DONE HERE.

22:16.466 --> 22:17.937
I'M DONE TALKING
TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.910
YOU OKAY?

22:22.572 --> 22:24.844
- YEAH, THAT WAS KIND OF...
- INTENSE?

22:24.844 --> 22:26.976
YEAH, IT SOUNDED LIKE
SHE WAS GONNA EAT YOU ALIVE.

22:26.976 --> 22:30.349
- WHAT YOU SAY TO HER?
- CHIEF MASTERSON.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.922
- LACEY.
- DID YOU TELL GLORIA CRANE
THAT DANNY FOUND

22:32.922 --> 22:34.454
- THE NECKLACE IN HIS LOCKER?
- NO, WHY?

22:34.454 --> 22:37.457
BECAUSE SHE KNEW ABOUT IT.
SHE JUST TOLD ME.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.958
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS
THE ONE THAT PUT IT THERE?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.690
( sighs )

22:44.934 --> 22:46.566
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO SAY IT AGAIN.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.097
PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE
THEIR HORSES STRAIGHT BACK

22:48.097 --> 22:50.470
TO THE STALLS
AFTER THEY COMPETE, OKAY?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.402
THANK YOU.

22:53.843 --> 22:55.805
WE NEED TO TALK.

22:56.946 --> 22:58.448
NOW.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.793
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
IT'S TURKEY AND SWISS--
YOUR FAVORITE.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.666
THANKS. I--
I JUST GUESS...

23:16.666 --> 23:18.698
I'M NOT AS HUNGRY
AS I THOUGHT.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.430
HOW CAN YOU NOT BE HUNGRY?

23:20.430 --> 23:21.831
( chuckles )

23:21.831 --> 23:24.834
WHAT, WERE YOU OUT THERE
HUNTING WILD BOAR?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.911
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU MUST BE TRAUMATIZED

23:31.911 --> 23:34.684
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED,
BUT IT'S OVER NOW.

23:34.684 --> 23:36.886
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

23:36.886 --> 23:38.818
- IT CAN BE.
- NO.

23:39.849 --> 23:40.850
IT CAN'T.

23:44.694 --> 23:46.856
THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR FATHER, ISN'T IT?

23:49.098 --> 23:50.199
JO TOLD ME...

23:52.201 --> 23:54.433
THAT YOU OVERHEARD
ME AND KYLE TALKING,

23:54.433 --> 23:55.865
HOW HE MIGHT STILL BE ALIVE

23:55.865 --> 23:58.938
AND HIS POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT
IN ALL OF THIS.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.911
LISTEN TO ME.
WE DON'T NEED HIM.

24:01.911 --> 24:03.913
- WE HAVE EACH OTHER.
- JUST STOP.

24:03.913 --> 24:06.445
OKAY, PLEASE,
JUST STOP TALKING.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.649
YOU HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT I AM GOING THROUGH.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.927
SOMETHING HAPPENED OUT THERE,
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

24:17.927 --> 24:20.830
I-- I DID SOMETHING.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.832
I DID SOMETHING
THAT I CAN'T TAKE BACK.

24:22.832 --> 24:26.836
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU WERE TRAPPED IN
AN EXTREME SITUATION.

24:26.836 --> 24:29.869
AND WHATEVER YOU DID OUT THERE,
YOU NEED TO LEAVE IT OUT THERE.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.941
OKAY?
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

24:31.941 --> 24:34.504
HOW CAN--
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

24:34.504 --> 24:37.046
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
I LOST YOU FOR FIVE YEARS.

24:37.046 --> 24:38.678
I CAN'T LOSE YOU AGAIN.

24:38.678 --> 24:42.882
MOM, OUR WHOLE FAMILY
IS BUILT ON SECRETS,

24:42.882 --> 24:45.815
AND I WILL NOT ADD
ANOTHER ONE TO THAT PILE.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.570
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

25:00.570 --> 25:01.871
HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH?

25:01.871 --> 25:03.533
YOU'RE EITHER
PROTECTING SOMEONE ELSE

25:03.533 --> 25:05.635
- OR YOU'RE PROTECTING YOURSELF!
- MYSELF?

25:05.635 --> 25:07.106
- HOW COULD YOU IMPLY--
- GLORIA, YOU SET UP

25:07.106 --> 25:08.878
AN INNOCENT 16-YEAR-OLD BOY!

25:08.878 --> 25:10.640
HE'S NOT INNOCENT!

25:10.640 --> 25:13.913
VIKRAM SAW HIM!
HE SAW HIM KILL MY BABY!

25:13.913 --> 25:17.186
- ( sighs )
- REGINA CALLED ME
THAT NIGHT THAT SHE...

25:18.618 --> 25:21.591
IT WAS VERY LATE
AND SHE'D BEEN DRINKING.

25:21.591 --> 25:24.293
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
INVITING DANNY OVER.

25:24.293 --> 25:25.925
SHE WAS GONNA TELL HIM
EVERYTHING THAT SHE KNEW--

25:25.925 --> 25:28.728
ABOUT VIKRAM BEING ALIVE,
ABOUT...

25:30.059 --> 25:31.100
ABOUT WHAT?

25:34.103 --> 25:36.105
VIKRAM AND I WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.967
REGINA FOUND OUT.

25:37.967 --> 25:41.070
SHE FOLLOWED ME ONE NIGHT
WHEN I WENT TO MEET HIM.

25:41.070 --> 25:44.874
NO ONE ELSE COULD KNOW
THAT VIKRAM WAS ALIVE.

25:44.874 --> 25:46.616
IT WAS
TOO DANGEROUS FOR HIM.

25:46.616 --> 25:48.247
SO VIKRAM PAID HER
TO KEEP QUIET?

25:48.247 --> 25:50.720
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE BLACKMAIL
UNTIL THAT NIGHT

25:50.720 --> 25:53.623
WHEN SHE CALLED.
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE...

25:53.623 --> 25:55.655
DIDN'T WANT
HIS MONEY ANYMORE,

25:55.655 --> 25:58.087
THAT SHE COULDN'T KEEP
ALL OF THIS FROM DANNY.

25:58.087 --> 26:01.160
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
SHE TOLD THAT BOY?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.593
HE MUST'VE FLOWN
INTO A RAGE--

26:03.593 --> 26:05.695
- VIKRAM LIED TO YOU.
- NO.

26:05.695 --> 26:07.767
HE LOVED ME.

26:08.798 --> 26:10.569
AND I LOVED HIM.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.802
HE WAS PLANNING
TO LEAVE KAREN FOR ME.

26:12.802 --> 26:15.605
HE TRIED TO HELP ME.
HE SENT MARILYN.

26:15.605 --> 26:18.347
SHE GOT THAT NECKLACE,
GAVE IT TO ME.

26:18.347 --> 26:21.080
AND WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
TO PICK UP REGINA'S THINGS,

26:21.080 --> 26:23.613
I PUT IT THERE
IN DANNY'S LOCKER.

26:23.613 --> 26:25.615
MARILYN HAD THE COMBINATION--
I DON'T KNOW HOW--

26:25.615 --> 26:27.717
BUT SHE PROMISED ME

26:27.717 --> 26:29.358
THAT THE POLICE
WOULD CHECK THERE.

26:29.358 --> 26:31.160
SHE TOLD ME THAT
THEY WOULD FIND IT.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.223
MARILYN'S A CRIMINAL.
SHE PLANTED A FAKE
MURDER WEAPON

26:34.223 --> 26:36.595
AND THEN SHE DISAPPEARED,
JUST LIKE VIKRAM.

26:38.828 --> 26:41.631
- I NEED TO KNOW WHERE HE IS.
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:42.672 --> 26:43.933
HE MOVED AROUND A LOT.

26:43.933 --> 26:45.604
HE ALWAYS CALLED
FROM A BLOCKED NUMBER

26:45.604 --> 26:46.776
WHAT ABOUT MARILYN?

26:53.342 --> 26:55.344
YOU KNOW HOW
TO REACH HER, DON'T YA?

27:40.830 --> 27:43.432
GLORIA?
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

28:04.013 --> 28:07.356
- ( gun cocks )
- GLORIA COULDN'T MAKE IT.

28:08.958 --> 28:10.790
YOU'RE SMARTER
THAN THAT, MARILYN.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.723
( sighs )

28:15.164 --> 28:17.266
- ( clatters )
- STEP AWAY FROM THE WEAPON,

28:17.266 --> 28:19.328
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

28:19.328 --> 28:21.130
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.
UP AGAINST THE WALL.

28:22.471 --> 28:24.473
( handcuffs clicking )

28:27.206 --> 28:30.709
- ( police radio chatter )
- IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD
AN ATTORNEY,

28:30.709 --> 28:32.141
ONE WILL BE
PROVIDED FOR YOU.

28:32.141 --> 28:35.344
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS
THAT I'VE JUST READ TO YOU?

28:35.344 --> 28:37.947
WITH THESE RIGHTS IN MIND,
DO YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO ME?

28:37.947 --> 28:39.148
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:39.148 --> 28:40.820
YOU KILLED REGINA,
DIDN'T YOU?

28:42.191 --> 28:44.393
THAT WHY VIKRAM PAID YOU
THE 100,000? TO KILL HER?

28:44.393 --> 28:48.157
TO MAKE HIS OWN SON
TAKE THE FALL FOR IT?
ALL OF THE ABOVE?

28:49.929 --> 28:51.801
YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO DOWN FOR THIS ALONE?

28:51.801 --> 28:53.462
I HAVE GLORIA CRANE
WILLING TO TESTIFY

28:53.462 --> 28:55.334
THAT YOU TOOK THE NECKLACE
FROM THAT CRIME SCENE.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.207
I HAVE A FAKE MURDER WEAPON
AND PROOF THAT VIKRAM PAID YOU.

28:58.207 --> 29:00.209
I STRONGLY SUGGEST
YOU START TALKING.

29:00.209 --> 29:01.740
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SAY.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.512
YOU'LL NEVER FIND HIM.

29:03.512 --> 29:05.374
WHO? VIKRAM?

29:05.374 --> 29:08.147
SORRY, CHIEF,
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.379
HE'S LONG GONE BY NOW.

29:14.523 --> 29:15.384
Man:
LET'S GO.

29:21.430 --> 29:23.092
( doorbell chimes )

29:28.497 --> 29:30.399
- IS HE STILL HERE?
- LACEY, WHAT--

29:30.399 --> 29:32.441
WHERE IS HE?
IS HE OKAY?

29:32.441 --> 29:35.344
HE'S FINE. HE WAS HERE.
HE JUST WENT HOME ALREADY.

29:35.344 --> 29:37.807
- ( sighs )
- HE REALLY WANTS TO SEE YOU.

29:37.807 --> 29:39.778
HE'S JUST--
HE'S WITH HIS MOM, SO--

29:39.778 --> 29:41.380
OKAY.

29:43.512 --> 29:45.554
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME
WHEN HE CAME BACK?

29:45.554 --> 29:48.017
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY DAY.

29:48.017 --> 29:49.188
I SHOULD'VE. I JUST--

29:50.319 --> 29:51.460
HOW'D YOU EVEN KNOW
HE WAS HERE?

29:51.460 --> 29:54.163
- YOUR DAD TOLD ME.
- WHEN DID YOU--

29:54.163 --> 29:56.565
I WAS AT THE POLICE STATION,
GIVING A STATEMENT
ABOUT GLORIA CRANE.

29:56.565 --> 29:58.027
REGINA'S MOM?

29:58.027 --> 29:59.198
- Tess: JO, GET IN HERE.
- YEAH.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.432
Woman on TV:
In a shocking development,
police have apprehended

30:03.432 --> 30:08.307
investigator Marilyn Rossi
in the murder of Regina Crane.

30:08.307 --> 30:11.480
Rossi's arrest
comes only weeks

30:11.480 --> 30:15.184
after widespread belief
that local teen Danny Desai

30:15.184 --> 30:18.317
- was the leading
suspect in the case.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.520
- ( chatter on TV )
- Jo: I KNOW, IT'S--

30:21.520 --> 30:24.553
- IT'S AMAZING.
- HE FINALLY HAS
A CHANCE TO START OVER.

30:26.996 --> 30:29.428
- ( exhales sharply )
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:29.428 --> 30:30.529
- ( beeping )
- CALLING DANNY.

30:35.104 --> 30:37.366
- MISS ROSSI WILL
REMAIN HERE IN CUSTODY...
- ( cameras clicking )

30:37.366 --> 30:39.538
...UNTIL THE D.A. ARRIVES
AND TAKES HER OFFICIAL
STATEMENT.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.240
DID SHE SAY
WHY SHE KILLED HER?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.571
EVEN WITH MISS ROSSI'S
CONFESSION,

30:42.571 --> 30:44.373
THIS IS STILL
AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

30:44.373 --> 30:46.575
I CAN'T COMMENT
ON A SPECIFIC MOTIVE.

30:46.575 --> 30:48.377
THANK YOU.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE
FOR YOU NOW.

30:48.377 --> 30:50.549
- THANK YOU.
- ( reporters chattering )

30:52.982 --> 30:56.425
- DANNY! GET OVER HERE!
- MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
GO HOME.

30:56.425 --> 30:59.488
- Man: DANNY! DANNY DESAI.
- PLEASE GET IN THE CAR!

30:59.488 --> 31:01.430
- ( reporters chattering )
- Kyle: ALL RIGHT,
WAIT A SECOND.

31:01.430 --> 31:04.163
- GIVE HIM SOME ROOM.
GIVE HIM SOME ROOM.
- DANNY!

31:05.464 --> 31:06.996
Kyle:
OKAY, OKAY,
BACK OFF, BACK OFF.

31:06.996 --> 31:09.038
- GIVE HIM SOME ROOM.
- DANNY, HOW DOES IT FEEL

31:09.038 --> 31:11.440
- TO FINALLY BE VINDICATED?
- Man #2: DANNY, COULD WE
GET A STATEMENT?

31:11.440 --> 31:13.472
- Woman: AFTER ALL
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.
- Kyle: I JUST WANT TO SAY,

31:13.472 --> 31:16.906
ON BEHALF OF MYSELF
AND THE ENTIRE GREEN GROVE
POLICE DEPARTMENT...

31:18.107 --> 31:19.648
I'M SORRY, DANNY.

31:19.648 --> 31:21.480
I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.953
DANNY, THE WHOLE TOWN
WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU.

31:23.953 --> 31:25.114
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

31:33.292 --> 31:35.424
( scattered murmuring )

31:44.533 --> 31:47.106
UMM...
( gulps )

31:47.106 --> 31:49.939
- I FEEL GREAT.
IT FEELS REALLY GREAT.
- ( reporters chattering )

31:51.340 --> 31:52.982
EXCUSE ME.
MY SON HAS BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH.

31:52.982 --> 31:54.984
HE'S DONE TALKING NOW.

31:54.984 --> 31:57.246
Man:
MS. DESAI, HOW ARE YOU
FEELING ABOUT ALL THIS?

31:57.246 --> 32:00.689
I FEEL AMAZING.
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
THAT DANNY'S INNOCENT.

32:00.689 --> 32:03.652
AND TO HAVE THE WHOLE TOWN
THINK YOU'RE A SUSPECT--
IT'S TAKEN IT'S TOLL.

32:03.652 --> 32:05.354
SO WE'RE READY
FOR A FRESH START.

32:05.354 --> 32:06.925
IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS,

32:06.925 --> 32:08.457
- DID YOU EVER THINK
IT'D END LIKE THIS?
- ( laughs )

32:08.457 --> 32:11.200
Karen:
I KNEW THE TRUTH WOULD
COME OUT. MY SON IS INNOCENT.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.202
( reporters chattering )

32:20.609 --> 32:23.272
YOU AGAIN. WOW.

32:23.272 --> 32:25.074
I SAW YOU ON THE NEWS.

32:25.074 --> 32:27.446
I WANTED TO HEAD DOWN
AND CHECK OUT THE PARTY.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.219
SORRY, THE PARTY'S
PRETTY MUCH OVER.

32:30.219 --> 32:32.081
AH. OH WELL.

32:32.081 --> 32:34.453
HEY, I'M GLAD
THINGS WORKED OUT
FOR YOUR BUDDY DANNY.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.724
ME TOO.

32:36.725 --> 32:39.128
- SO WHY ARE YOU...
- ( sighs deeply )

32:39.128 --> 32:41.390
...WALKING BACK ALONE?
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT

32:41.390 --> 32:42.291
CELEBRATING WITH THE GUY?

32:43.492 --> 32:45.394
HE WENT HOME
WITH HIS MOM.

32:45.394 --> 32:47.536
JUST TIRED,
YOU KNOW?

32:48.998 --> 32:50.969
- I TOTALLY GET IT.
- YEAH YEAH.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.571
SURE, OF COURSE.

32:55.644 --> 32:59.678
SORRY IF I WAS
A LITTLE TENSE WITH YOU
TODAY AT THE STABLE.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.510
IT WAS JUST...
( sighs )

33:01.510 --> 33:04.253
- A TENSE SITUATION.
- YEAH.

33:04.253 --> 33:05.254
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

33:05.254 --> 33:07.286
- I WAS THERE.
- ( both laugh )

33:09.288 --> 33:11.560
I THOUGHT YOU HANDLED IT
PRETTY WELL, ACTUALLY.

33:12.621 --> 33:14.163
THANKS.

33:17.366 --> 33:19.428
WELL, I SHOULD GO.

33:20.599 --> 33:23.272
- SO I'LL SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.
- YEAH.

33:23.272 --> 33:25.304
- SEE YOU.
- BYE.

33:25.304 --> 33:28.307
( both chuckle )

33:30.209 --> 33:32.010
KYLE.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.383
( chuckles )
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

33:35.344 --> 33:36.785
I'M FINE, HONEY.

33:36.785 --> 33:38.247
I'M FINE.

33:38.247 --> 33:40.319
IT'S ALL OVER,
ISN'T IT?

33:41.220 --> 33:43.192
YOU SHOULD BE
SO PROUD OF YOURSELF.

33:43.192 --> 33:46.125
- I KNOW I AM.
- VIKRAM'S STILL OUT THERE.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.257
CUT YOURSELF A BREAK.

33:48.257 --> 33:49.728
YOU CAUGHT
REGINA'S KILLER TODAY.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.260
MARILYN DIDN'T ACT ALONE.

33:51.260 --> 33:53.762
- MAYBE SHE DID.
- HE PAID HER FOR IT.

33:53.762 --> 33:56.335
AND NOW, FOR SOME REASON,
SHE'S COVERING FOR HIM.

33:57.566 --> 33:59.738
HE SEEMS GOOD
AT GETTING PEOPLE
TO COVER FOR HIM.

33:59.738 --> 34:02.741
HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,
AND I'M GONNA FIND HIM.

34:12.281 --> 34:15.184
( squeaks, bangs )

34:31.570 --> 34:34.403
THERE'S STILL
ALL THESE REPORTERS
CAMPED OUT FRONT.

34:36.345 --> 34:39.077
I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
GETTING MY PICTURE TAKEN, SO--

34:45.784 --> 34:47.556
YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

34:49.118 --> 34:50.319
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

34:50.319 --> 34:52.321
IT'S BETTER FOR EVERYONE
IF WE JUST...

34:55.124 --> 34:56.325
NO ONE EVER HAS TO KNOW.

34:57.566 --> 35:00.169
- WE'LL KNOW.
- WE'LL FORGET.

35:00.169 --> 35:02.331
( scoffs ) HOW?

35:03.632 --> 35:05.334
- DANNY.
- WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

35:05.334 --> 35:08.507
- GO BACK TO OUR LIVES?
- WE HAVE TO.

35:08.507 --> 35:11.780
FORGET WHAT WE SAW?
WHAT I DID?

35:11.780 --> 35:14.343
HOW? HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

35:14.343 --> 35:15.384
DANNY, BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

35:16.785 --> 35:19.218
YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO BE THIS...

35:21.350 --> 35:23.292
TO BE THIS NORMAL PERSON...

35:24.423 --> 35:26.655
TO START OVER WITH EVERYONE,
WITH THE WHOLE TOWN.

35:28.257 --> 35:29.398
DO YOU KNOW
HOW RARE THAT IS?

35:29.398 --> 35:30.759
TO GET A SECOND CHANCE?

35:32.331 --> 35:34.263
YOU CAN'T GIVE THAT UP.
I WON'T LET YOU.

35:34.263 --> 35:36.705
MAYBE I DON'T DESERVE
A SECOND CHANCE, JO.

35:36.705 --> 35:38.867
YOU DESERVE IT
MORE THAN ANYONE.

35:39.838 --> 35:40.909
NOT MORE THAN YOU.

35:43.472 --> 35:45.174
I CAN'T FORGET.

35:46.715 --> 35:50.219
BUT... I'M NOT GONNA
SAY ANYTHING...

35:51.220 --> 35:52.621
FOR YOU.

35:52.621 --> 35:55.624
- AND FOR YOURSELF.
- NO. FOR YOU.

35:55.624 --> 35:59.388
AND FOR LACEY.
I JUST WANT BOTH
OF YOU TO BE HAPPY.

35:59.388 --> 36:01.390
AND WE CAN BE.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.194
ALL THREE OF US.

36:05.194 --> 36:06.535
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:20.549 --> 36:22.411
SO DO THE POLICE STILL THINK
DANNY'S DAD IS BEHIND IT ALL?

36:22.411 --> 36:25.654
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
THAT IT'S OVER NOW.

36:27.516 --> 36:29.218
RIGHT, YEAH, OF COURSE.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.361
SO HOW'S DANNY DOING?

36:32.361 --> 36:34.223
GOOD.
HE'S GOOD.

36:34.223 --> 36:36.425
I THINK HE'S JUST RELIEVED.
WE ALL ARE.

36:36.425 --> 36:38.867
YEAH, I BET.
YOU SEEMED PRETTY UPSET
WHEN I CAME OVER LAST NIGHT.

36:39.868 --> 36:42.771
YEAH. WELL,
IT WAS STRESSFUL, SO--

36:44.202 --> 36:45.374
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

36:45.374 --> 36:47.205
OH, THAT CHEMISTRY QUIZ.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.877
REMEMBER?

36:48.877 --> 36:50.909
RIGHT. I AM
SO SCREWED FOR THAT.

36:50.909 --> 36:52.541
I'LL CATCH YOU UP.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.484
OKAY. THANKS.

36:57.646 --> 36:59.448
RICO.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.991
WE NEVER ACTUALLY
DISCUSSED, LIKE...

37:02.991 --> 37:04.723
WHAT HAPPENED WITH US.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.326
OH YEAH, LOOK,
WE DON'T--

37:07.326 --> 37:09.758
WE DON'T NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THAT,
YOU KNOW. ( scoffs )

37:09.758 --> 37:12.461
- THAT WAS LIKE
A MILLENNIUM AGO.
- ( chuckles ) YEAH.

37:12.461 --> 37:14.503
I THINK IT WAS
ONLY TWO NIGHTS.

37:14.503 --> 37:16.405
- YEAH, IT WAS
ONLY TWO NIGHTS.
- I JUST...

37:17.806 --> 37:19.768
I WANNA MAKE SURE
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I...

37:21.970 --> 37:24.473
THESE NIGHTS THAT WE'VE
SPENT HERE IN OUR BOOTH?

37:25.574 --> 37:27.376
I'VE NEVER
APPRECIATED THEM MORE.

37:29.678 --> 37:31.880
- REALLY?
- DEFINITELY.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.252
THEY'RE SOME
OF THE BEST NIGHTS
OF MY LIFE.

37:44.993 --> 37:46.034
HEY.

37:47.296 --> 37:48.937
YOUR MOM SAID THAT
YOU WERE AT JOHNNY CAKES.

37:48.937 --> 37:50.569
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY
TO GO SEE HIM?

37:50.569 --> 37:52.671
DANNY? NO.

37:53.802 --> 37:55.874
I'M SURE HE NEEDS TIME
TO DECOMPRESS.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.380
THIS IS ALL SO WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

38:01.380 --> 38:02.751
WHAT'S WEIRD?

38:02.751 --> 38:05.684
IT'S ALL FINALLY OVER.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.916
EVERYTHING WITH REGINA
AND DANNY.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.621
I FEEL LIKE I CAN BREATHE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS.

38:14.363 --> 38:17.566
YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT HIM, DON'T YOU?

38:17.566 --> 38:20.769
- WE BOTH DO.
- YEAH BUT, I MEAN,
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE

38:20.769 --> 38:23.872
TO HELP HIM,
TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.

38:26.335 --> 38:27.476
YOU TWO SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.880
- JO, COME ON, WE DIDN'T--
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

38:31.880 --> 38:35.313
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH HIM,
YOU SHOULD.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.388
I NEVER ASKED YOU-- WHAT--

38:39.388 --> 38:41.450
WHAT DO YOU THINK DANNY
WAS GONNA TELL YOUR DAD?

38:43.051 --> 38:45.494
OH, AT THE--
AT THE POLICE STATION?

38:45.494 --> 38:46.995
YEAH, HE SEEMED
REALLY ANXIOUS
TO TALK TO HIM.

38:46.995 --> 38:49.358
DO YOU THINK IT WAS
ABOUT VIKRAM AND AUNT TARA?

38:50.759 --> 38:53.001
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

38:53.001 --> 38:54.863
I HOPE SO. I MEAN,
IT'S NOT LIKE HE NEEDS

38:54.863 --> 38:55.964
TO PROTECT
HIS DAD ANYMORE, RIGHT?

38:55.964 --> 38:57.666
SO HE MIGHT AS WELL
TELL THE TRUTH--

38:57.666 --> 38:58.807
HE WAS NEVER A KILLER.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.771
WELL, MAYBE IT'S EASIER
TO LEAVE ALL OF THAT
IN THE PAST, THOUGH.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.445
I MEAN, WOULD ANYONE
EVEN BELIEVE HIM

39:06.445 --> 39:07.746
AFTER FIVE YEARS?

39:07.746 --> 39:10.479
- THERE'S NO ONE THERE
TO BACK HIM UP.
- EXCEPT VIKRAM.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.752
I HOPE YOUR DAD FINDS HIM.

39:15.584 --> 39:16.855
ME TOO.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.588
( folk music playing )

39:19.588 --> 39:21.590
Man:
Ms. Desai, how do you
feel about all this?

39:21.590 --> 39:24.032
I feel amazing.

TO PROTECT YOU FROM HIM,

40:35.203 --> 40:36.965
WHO HE REALLY IS.

40:38.507 --> 40:40.639
I JUST WISH
I HAD DONE A BETTER JOB.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.612
BUT YOU'RE OKAY.

40:43.612 --> 40:45.844
YOU GREW
INTO THIS GREAT PERSON,

40:45.844 --> 40:48.176
THIS WONDERFUL MAN.

40:48.176 --> 40:50.849
A BETTER MAN
THAN YOUR FATHER.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.781
I'M NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

40:52.781 --> 40:56.054
WHAT? HOW CAN YOU
EVEN SAY THAT?

40:56.054 --> 40:59.187
- BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.
- DANNY, IF YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING,

40:59.187 --> 41:01.089
JUST TRY NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

41:01.089 --> 41:03.892
YOU CAN GO ON PRETENDING
THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT,

41:03.892 --> 41:06.965
AND I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT
THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

41:09.898 --> 41:11.770
I MIGHT AS WELL
BE BACK IN PRISON.

41:42.070 --> 41:45.634
Tess:
VIKRAM, IT'S ME AGAIN.
WHY AREN'T YOU PICKING UP?

41:45.634 --> 41:48.136
KYLE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.
HE'S DETERMINED TO FIND YOU.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.140
I'M SO CONFUSED.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.913
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

41:56.915 --> 42:00.789
BUT I KNOW ONE THING:
I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

42:00.789 --> 42:03.652
NO MORE LIES,
NO MORE SECRETS.

42:03.652 --> 42:05.894
YOU HAVE TO
TURN YOURSELF IN.

42:07.255 --> 42:08.857
IT'S TIME TO EXPLAIN.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.030
YOU NEED
TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.
