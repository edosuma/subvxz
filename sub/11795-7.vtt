00:06.906 --> 00:09.776

01:19.612 --> 01:22.082
   Everybody's excited
   about the class ski trip.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.517
   Unfortunately,
   we don't have any money.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.553
 Now if I don't come up
 with something quick,

01:26.586 --> 01:29.189
   I'm gonna have to sell
   my parents' house again.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.560
  Hey, I see you're
  ready for the trip.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.663
 -What are you talking about?
 -Well, you got your ski poles.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.998
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Those are your legs.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.936
   You're cute.
   That's real good.

01:42.969 --> 01:46.106
  Excuse me. Could you find
  our waiter for us, please?

01:46.106 --> 01:50.944
  No, this I cannot do,
  for he hath gone
  to a better place.

01:50.977 --> 01:53.880
-What do you mean?
-He's in the bathroom.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.250
  -Who are you?
  -My name is James.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.853
-James,
you should be an actor.
-I am an actor,

01:59.886 --> 02:03.590
 and to prove it,
 I will now act like a waiter.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.259
   Tip is not included.
   Check.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.795
Guys, we have got
a real problem.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.297
 How are we gonna
 pay for the ski trip?

02:11.331 --> 02:13.667
   Well, I make money
   the old-fashioned way...

02:13.700 --> 02:17.570
I pout until Daddy
gives it to me.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.140
  I could charge
  lonely girls $0.25

02:20.173 --> 02:23.209
   to watch me
   flex my muscles.

02:23.243 --> 02:27.080
 You know what they say,
 ''Big muscles, small brain.''

02:27.080 --> 02:29.149
   Zack: Yeah! Ooh!

02:29.182 --> 02:31.117
 Hey, I just thought of a great
 way to make money.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.888
 Zack, your ideas
 only help you. That's selfish,
 that's unfair...

02:34.921 --> 02:37.157
 -A carnival.
 -That is a really great idea.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.693
   I got a great idea
   how to make money
   for the ski trip.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.761
 I'll sell my body to science.

02:41.795 --> 02:45.265
You'd have to pay them
to tow it away.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.967
 Come on, let's go
 ask Belding about a carnival.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.904
All right,
let's make this quick.
I have a school to run.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.373
   Well, Mr. Belding, I think
   you're one of the best...

02:53.406 --> 02:57.610
   no, the best principal
   in the history
   of principalism.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.612
-Does everybody agree?
-All: Oh, yeah.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.848
  Zack, you're not a matador,

03:01.881 --> 03:04.784
   so take the bull outside.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.953
 What the blond
 sucker-upper is trying to say,

03:07.053 --> 03:10.323
   is that we'd like to have
   a carnival to make money
   for our ski trip.

03:10.357 --> 03:14.060
  -Good idea. Do it.
  -Really? All right.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.662
 Thanks, Mr. Belding.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.064
   Great, I've got places to go
   and lips to gloss.

03:19.099 --> 03:22.669
 Zack. Zack!
 Wait.

03:25.105 --> 03:29.075
   Do you know what
   the letters F,
   F, D and C mean?

03:29.109 --> 03:32.145
   ''Fine feathered
   dogs and cats.''

03:32.178 --> 03:34.881
   -No.
   -That's okay.
   I love this game.

03:34.914 --> 03:37.350
F, F, D and C
are your grades

03:37.384 --> 03:39.986
   in Science, History,
   English and Math.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.087
 Wow!

03:41.087 --> 03:43.256
 Hey, I didn't know I was doing
 that well in Math.

03:43.289 --> 03:45.792
-A ''C''?
-Zack, you're flunking.

03:45.825 --> 03:48.161
 I think it's time for me
 to finally meet your father.

03:48.194 --> 03:50.697
  My father?
  Wait a second, sir.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.699
My... my mother
always comes to school.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.734
She's got
her own parking space.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.704
  She's also got
  no idea what kind
  of student you really are.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.839
 Well, you gotta love her, sir.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.042
No father, no ski trip.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.910
 You tell your father to be
 in my office

04:03.943 --> 04:05.712
  at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.249
   I want my mommy.

04:09.282 --> 04:13.186
 You buy 100 computers from us,
 and I'll knock off 20%.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.755
 All right, all right,

04:15.789 --> 04:18.091
I'll even throw in season
tickets for the Lakers.

04:18.124 --> 04:20.360
   -Fine. Call me back.
   -Hi, Dad.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.861
 Your Mom said
 you wanted to see me.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.364
   -Is there a problem?
   -Problem?

04:24.397 --> 04:27.133
Well, yes.
Oh, but it's not mine.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.370
I have a friend
who has a big problem.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.072
   -You see...
   -( phone rings )

04:32.072 --> 04:36.076
  Excuse me, just a minute.
  Derek Morris.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.345
 Yes,
 yes, those seats are good.
 Listen, these...

04:38.378 --> 04:40.947
 these seats are so close
 that Magic Johnson's

04:40.980 --> 04:43.983
gonna have to
dribble around you
just to score.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.086
 All right, I'll see you later.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.787
 Now what
 were you saying, son?

04:50.156 --> 04:53.259
  My... my friend's grades
  are kind of below average.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.995
 Now, if you were his father...
 which you're not...

04:56.096 --> 04:57.831
 would you let him go
 on a ski trip anyway

04:57.864 --> 05:00.667
 if he promised to work really,
 really hard after he got back?

05:00.700 --> 05:03.036
  Absolutely not.
  School comes first.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.872
  Oh.

05:05.905 --> 05:09.042
  What's the matter?
  Is something wrong?

05:09.042 --> 05:11.077
  -Actually,
  Dad, the truth is that...
  -( phone rings )

05:11.111 --> 05:13.713
   Excuse me just a second.
   Derek Morris.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.916
 Yeah. Could you...
 could you hold for a minute?

05:16.950 --> 05:20.220
   You know, son,
   if I were your
   friend's father,

05:20.253 --> 05:23.089
  I think that
  I would ground him.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.492
   Actually,
   I'd ground him for life.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.160
 Are we finished here?

05:28.228 --> 05:30.864
 I know I am.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.266
 Good. I'm glad
 I could help you out.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.502
 Listen, I got
 a great deal for you.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.971
  Well, you... you...
  you just gotta hear this...

05:38.071 --> 05:40.073
  Grounded for life?

05:41.908 --> 05:43.943
  ( snoring )

05:45.812 --> 05:48.081
 ( knocking on door )

05:50.083 --> 05:52.552
Hello?

05:52.585 --> 05:56.956
-Hey, who's there?
-How've you been, Zack?

05:57.424 --> 06:00.393
Fine, there... Jessie?

06:00.427 --> 06:03.797
  Preppie, we've
  come to visit you.

06:03.830 --> 06:07.400
 Yeah, you've been grounded
 for 75 years.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.804
  Oh!

06:10.837 --> 06:13.206
   Hey, I'll call you back,
   I've got company.

06:13.239 --> 06:16.076
 You've missed a lot, Zack.
 We all have kids.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.478
   Our kids have kids,
   and their kids have kids.

06:18.511 --> 06:21.281
  And their kids have zits.
  Whoa!

06:22.515 --> 06:24.417
 Is that you, Screech?

06:25.518 --> 06:27.454
  I remember Screech.

06:27.487 --> 06:32.125
   Cute little fella.
   Whatever happened to him?

06:32.158 --> 06:35.562
  -Let's go to the concert.
  -Our favorite
  group's performing.

06:35.595 --> 06:38.965
Yeah, ''The Old Men
on the Block.''

06:39.065 --> 06:42.168
 Well, bye, Preppie.
 Come along, dear. Come along.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.372
Dear?
You and Slater?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.375
  You haven't been around
  for 75 years, Zack.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.911
After 60, I got frisky.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.892
Mr. Belding wants
to meet my dad.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.560
   What am I gonna tell him
   when he doesn't show up?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.463
  Tell him
  you have two moms.

07:10.497 --> 07:14.200
 No, I think I'll tell him
 I have an idiot for a friend.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.236
  ( French accent
  ) Would you like
  to hear tonight's specials?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.438
 To begin with,
 we have the French onion soup

07:18.471 --> 07:21.074
  ( Indian accent ) followed by
  an Indian curry...
  is very good,

07:21.107 --> 07:22.409
   very, very good, indeed!

07:22.442 --> 07:24.878
( German accent )
Und for dessert, we have
a German chocolate cake.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.447
  You will eat it,
  you will like it,
  there is no choice!

07:29.582 --> 07:31.151
   Wow! You're really good.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.154
 Thank you. I'm rehearsing
 for my acting class.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.589
 So what's it gonna be, fellas?

07:37.557 --> 07:39.492
Just a Coke.
I'm not really hungry.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.195
   -Is something wrong?
   -No.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.864
 No? You're failing, and when
 the principal meets your dad,

07:44.898 --> 07:47.300
you won't be able
to go on the ski trip.

07:47.334 --> 07:50.470
 It'll be sadder
 than the end of <i>E.T.</i>

07:50.503 --> 07:53.239
If you were my son,
I'd let you go skiing.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.442
  You would?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.079
 -( knocking )
 -Come in.

08:01.147 --> 08:05.919
 -Right on time, Zack.
 -Mr. Belding,
 this is my father.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.021
 Dad?

08:08.021 --> 08:11.424
   Hello, I'm Derek Morris.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.197
  Nice to meet you,
  Mr. Morris.

08:17.230 --> 08:21.334
 I'm on a very tight schedule,
 Mr. Belden... Buh... Burding.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.636
   So if we could just
   get on with this?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.105
 Sure.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.307
  Belding, Belding...
  ( mutters )

08:27.340 --> 08:30.677
  Mr. Morris,
  your son's grades are down.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.179
   ( gasps )

08:33.212 --> 08:36.448
I feel that two weeks
extra help after school
would be beneficial.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.085
   -Two weeks?
   -I don't agree with that.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.054
 -Good one, Dad.
 -Two months is more like it.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.188
Father!

08:43.222 --> 08:46.626
 I'm gonna get Zack
 the toughest
 tutor money can buy,

08:46.659 --> 08:50.130
   and I'm gonna make him study
   an extra six
   hours every night.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.966
   And no ski trip.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.268
 Mr. Morris, I think
 you're overreacting.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.204
And overacting.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.006
   After all,
   this is just high school.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.342
  It's not like he's ever gonna
  remember most of this stuff

09:02.375 --> 09:04.010
   when he gets outta here.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.546
 I mean, who cares about
 the isosceles triangle anyway?

09:07.147 --> 09:09.382
I care! I care.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.520
 Now I see know why Zack
 turned out like this.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.022
 Father, I failed you.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.024
   Zack, you're not so bad.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.026
-Yes, he is.
-No, he's not.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.028
-No, yes, he is!
-No, he's not!

09:22.028 --> 09:24.030
  No, really, he is!

09:24.030 --> 09:28.601
 -Zack is a decent kid. Good...
 -Both: Almost.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.338
  Why don't you ease up on him,
  Mr. Morris?

09:31.371 --> 09:34.441
You're a compassionate man,
Mr. B.

09:34.474 --> 09:38.078
 Zack was right about you.
 Why, he was going on and on...

09:38.111 --> 09:40.714
 Dad, you're embarrassing me.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.716
 Well... hmm.

09:43.783 --> 09:48.188
Maybe you're right,
Mr... Belding.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.191
 I'll let you go
 on that ski trip, after all.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.094
   -If it's all right with you?
   -Sure.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.230
   Dad, Mr. Belding,

09:57.263 --> 09:59.666
   I love you guys.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.679
  Screech,
  I didn't know you looked
  so good in a bathing suit.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.447
 See what you're missing, baby?

10:14.481 --> 10:16.583
  Move it or lose it.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.823
Very tempting.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.426
  Don't even think about it.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.262
   Of course, you're a girl,

10:29.295 --> 10:31.431
 so it's not like you could
 hit it anyway.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.807
   You know what
   I like about you Jessie?

10:40.840 --> 10:42.676
  You throw just like a girl.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.111
 Why don't you just
 hire a man to do it?

10:56.389 --> 10:59.359
 I hope pigs can swim.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.363
Hey, Screech, I did it.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.332
And James was so tough,
Belding will never call
  on my father again.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.601
  All right.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.603
  Zack, I have
  a surprise for you.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.506
   I wrote your father a letter
   and invited him
   to see me again.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.141
 What?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.143
  ( shouting )
  He wrote your
  father a letter...

11:18.411 --> 11:20.413
  I'm gonna ask him
  to chaperone the ski trip.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.350
   I think it would
   be good for both of you.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.152
   Boy, is he wrong.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.758
  Mr. Belding,
  this is my father.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.793
 Derek Morris.

11:37.230 --> 11:41.167
   Hello, I'm Dick Belding.

11:42.736 --> 11:46.573
-Is Zack in trouble?
-Trouble? Zack?

11:46.606 --> 11:49.342
 I don't believe I've ever
 heard those two words

11:49.376 --> 11:53.279
   used in the same
   sentence before.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.782
 Mr. Belding, you're too kind.

11:55.815 --> 11:57.851
  That's a nice tie.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.886
 Silk?

12:03.690 --> 12:05.425
 Now.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.797
  -Wait!
  -What now, Screech?

12:10.830 --> 12:12.832
  -I'm late for an appointment.
  -Mr. Belding, come quick.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.569
  -Someone
  poisoned the chess team.
  -It's a sick world.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.707
   Mr. Morris,
   I wanted to speak to you

12:20.740 --> 12:23.677
   about your son Zachariah.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.779
  ( whispering )
  Zachariah?

12:25.812 --> 12:28.648
There's no problem,
I hope?

12:28.682 --> 12:30.717
Problem? Zack?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.654
   Why, Zack is
   the most improved student

12:34.688 --> 12:36.423
  we have at Bayside.

12:36.456 --> 12:40.660
 Just look at these grades:
 A, A, A, A, A...

12:40.694 --> 12:42.962
  I worked hard for you, Dad.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.266
  You're just a computer chip
  off the old block,
  aren't you, Zack?

12:46.299 --> 12:48.668
I think you should
reward the boy,

12:48.702 --> 12:51.538
perhaps buy him a car.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.374
  A Ferrari.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.710
  Sorry, no Ferrari.

12:57.711 --> 13:00.046
  No harm in trying.

13:00.046 --> 13:03.350
Come on, Dad, Mr. Belding
has many
important things to do.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.719
Oh, I bet I do.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.487
   Wait a second, is this...

13:07.520 --> 13:09.889
  Is that an XR7000?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.726
  Why yes, I guess...
  yes, it is.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.562
  -I sell these things.
  -Aah.

13:15.595 --> 13:18.298
 What kind of lease do you have
 on this, Mr. Belding?

13:18.331 --> 13:22.836
  I don't know. I...

13:25.505 --> 13:27.674
 ( whispering )
 Stall, stall.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.714
  Oh my gosh.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.752
 Zack: <i>I repeat, stall, stall!</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:40.086
What'd you say?

13:40.086 --> 13:43.857
 I think there are more
 in the stall, stall.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.894
We're not happy nerds.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.964
What happened?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.099
   It was Valley, sir,
   they spiked our Ovaltine.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.403
-Stay here,
I'll get the nurse.
-Wait.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.737
 Oops.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.807
   A walkie-talkie?

14:00.840 --> 14:04.511
   That's the last time I order
   a sub with everything.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.546
 What's going on here?

14:06.579 --> 14:09.849
  You guys are faking,
  aren't you?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.586
-Well, ah...
-Wait. Wait a minute...

14:13.620 --> 14:16.923
  wait a minute.
  I have a meeting
  with Zack's father.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.093
 Something tells me I'd better
 get back to the office quick.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.395
 And I'll deal
 with you nerds later.

14:22.429 --> 14:26.499
   We're not nerds,
   we're chess jocks, okay?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.368
 Okay.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.839
   Little Egg to Big Egg,
   the Bald Eagle is
   flying your way.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.810
  <i>I repeat, the Bald Eagle</i>
  <i>is flying your way.</i>

14:36.843 --> 14:40.113
 Mr. Belding, I can get you
 a better lease on
 these computers.

14:40.146 --> 14:43.083
  -I'd like to do that for you.
  -Oh!

14:43.116 --> 14:45.352
I'll call you.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.155
-Zack,
I'll see you later at home.
-Bye, Dad.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.925
   Hurry, Belding's coming.
   Come on.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.767
-I got you now!
-Sir...

15:00.800 --> 15:03.937
 You thought you had me,
 didn't you,
 with the chess team,

15:04.037 --> 15:05.772
the nerds,
the poisoned Ovaltine?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.375
   But you didn't,
   'cause I knew
   something strange

15:08.408 --> 15:10.043
 was going on in here.

15:10.043 --> 15:14.814
Mr. Belding,
the only strange thing
in this office is you.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.085
  I need a vacation.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.122
  ( carnival music playing )

15:33.600 --> 15:36.403
  Do you have brains?
  Do you have talent?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.673
 Well, if so, then you are
 way ahead of Slater.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.875
  But he is strong...
  now don't push, don't push,

15:41.908 --> 15:44.978
he's got enough muscles
for everybody.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.516
  All right.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.086
   One, two, three,

15:53.086 --> 15:55.088
  go!

16:00.493 --> 16:01.895
 How was that?

16:01.928 --> 16:05.665
Stupid, dumb,
did I mention pinhead?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.436
What are you talking about?
I killed that guy.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.839
 Yeah, and dead guys don't
 pay a dollar to arm-wrestle.

16:12.872 --> 16:15.041
You gotta play along,
make them think
they're winning

16:15.041 --> 16:16.543
 before you slam them.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.044
  Okay. Okay!

16:19.045 --> 16:20.480
 Next!

16:23.750 --> 16:24.818
 Ahem.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.086
 Wait!

16:27.821 --> 16:29.889
 You're mine!

16:33.259 --> 16:36.529
 One, two, three, go!

16:37.931 --> 16:39.199
 ( cheering )

16:44.804 --> 16:46.539
  I did it! I did it!

16:46.573 --> 16:48.208
I beat Slater.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.076
 You're not so tough.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.649
How could you
do that to me?

16:59.252 --> 17:02.522
   I'll let you know
   when we're on the slopes.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.890
 Next!

17:10.730 --> 17:12.732
  Hi! This is for me,

17:12.766 --> 17:14.934
 and this is for you.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.759
   That one.

17:39.793 --> 17:42.962
  Wow, you're right!
  Hey, you're great at this.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.899
  If you would
  have bet a dollar,
  you could have won a prize.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.068
   -Oh, no!
   -Oh, yes!

17:49.302 --> 17:52.906
And just think what
you could win for $10.

17:52.939 --> 17:56.309
-Dare I, dude?
-Like, for sure, dude.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.279
  Here we go.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.823
The first one.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.791
Better luck next time.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.095
Gnarly!

18:15.128 --> 18:17.197
 Thanks, dude.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.732
  Attention, please!

18:18.765 --> 18:21.034
 Get your tickets now
 and be the first ones

18:21.067 --> 18:23.937
 to sink
 Mr. Belding in the dunk tank.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.606
 ( cheering )

18:26.639 --> 18:29.542
 Hey, this is great!
 Mr. Belding's in the dunk tank

18:29.576 --> 18:31.845
  and I'm going skiing.
  And my dad,

18:31.878 --> 18:33.913
 he never knew
 there was a problem.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.282
My dad?

18:36.316 --> 18:38.318
 -Dad, what are you doing here?
 -Oh, hi, Zack.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.753
   I was looking
   for Mr. Belding.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.621
  I wanted to close
  that computer deal.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.125
 -Where is he?
 -( cheering )

18:45.158 --> 18:47.861
  I think he's over here
  at the toad races, come on.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.596
   Hey, guys,
   you wanna throw?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.898
 Sorry, AC,
 I'm here on business.

18:51.931 --> 18:55.201
 Come on,
 It'll only take a second.
 Here, show us how it's done.

18:55.235 --> 18:59.606
 -No, come on, Dad...
 -Why not? It looks like fun.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.874
  All right.

19:00.907 --> 19:04.044
   Hey, give it your best shot,
   old timer.

19:04.077 --> 19:08.181
Let's see what kind of heat
the old man has
left in his arm.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.016
   Okay!
   Fire when ready.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.688
   All: Ohh!

19:14.721 --> 19:16.823
Hey, good arm.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.626
   Well, I pitched a little bit
   in college.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.096
  All: Oooh!

19:23.129 --> 19:24.831
   Was that a boys' college,

19:24.864 --> 19:27.734
  or a girls' college?
  ( laughs )

19:27.767 --> 19:29.836
 I'm sorry,
 I had to heckle you.

19:32.072 --> 19:34.107
  ( crowd cheering )

19:36.843 --> 19:39.713
Gee whiz, I'm sorry,
I just had to dunk you.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.948
   Who is this jerk?

19:42.048 --> 19:44.150
  Nice shot. Come on,
  let's go, let's go.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.921
 -What's your name, fireballer?
 -Well, I'm Der...

19:49.189 --> 19:51.725
Son? Why did you
do that, Zack?

19:51.758 --> 19:54.260
   Zack,
   I am calling your father.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.696
-Well, I'm right here.
-You're not his father.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.365
I am the principal,
and I know his father.

19:58.398 --> 20:02.869
 You're not the principal.
 I know the princi...

20:02.902 --> 20:05.905
  There appears to be
  a misunderstanding.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.675
   Seems to me they've got it
   figured out pretty well.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.382
   -( knocking )
   -Zack...

20:16.916 --> 20:18.418
 the ski trip is off.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.389
   Why couldn't you
   just be straight with me?

20:22.422 --> 20:25.025
  Why couldn't you tell me
  you were having
  trouble in school?

20:25.058 --> 20:28.294
 Dad, I tried to tell you,
 but you're not
 that easy to talk to.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.897
 You used to
 tell me everything.
 What happened to us?

20:30.930 --> 20:33.166
   -( phone rings )
   -Excuse me, son.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.769
   -That's what happened to us.
   -Yeah,

20:35.802 --> 20:39.439
 Charlie,
 could you call me back
 in a few minutes? Yeah, right.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.075
  See, that's the problem.
  You're always on
  that stupid phone.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.177
  This is business,
  this is important.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.046
   Is it more important
   than your family?

20:47.781 --> 20:49.883
 There's nothing more important
 to me than you
 and your mother.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.218
   -You know that, Zack.
   -( phone rings )

20:52.252 --> 20:55.155
 Just a minute.
 Yeah.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.092
   Charlie,
   listen, tell him that...

20:59.125 --> 21:02.929
   I'll meet him
   anywhere he wants.
   It doesn't matter to me.

21:02.962 --> 21:06.366
  I'll make time for him.
  Yeah, thanks a lot.

21:07.801 --> 21:10.370
-( phone rings )
-Derek Morris.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.807
-Dad.
-Zack?

21:13.840 --> 21:16.509
   Is this the only way
   I can get through to you?

21:16.543 --> 21:18.144
  No.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.286
 Son.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.324
  Son, when was the last time

21:31.358 --> 21:34.160
 we sat down
 and had a long talk?

21:36.463 --> 21:40.100
 I think when I skinned my knee
 stealing home
 in Little League.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.936
  Ahh!
  ( laughs )

21:42.969 --> 21:45.872
   That umpire was
   blind as a bat.
   You were safe by a mile.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.108
  That's right.
  I can't believe
  you remember that.

21:48.108 --> 21:51.411
  Oh, yeah, I remember that.
  What about that... that...

21:51.444 --> 21:53.146
 that big fishing trip
 we took, huh?

21:53.179 --> 21:56.883
  -Where you fell
  right in the lake.
  -I didn't fall in.

21:56.916 --> 22:00.920
 I jumped in after
 my retainer fell out.

22:00.954 --> 22:04.924
Somewhere there's a catfish
swimming around
with perfect teeth.

22:06.059 --> 22:08.194
( phone rings )

22:08.228 --> 22:12.899
  Son, I have to take this.
  It won't be a second,
  I promise you.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.901
Yeah, Charlie.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.303
 Oh, that's terrific.

22:17.337 --> 22:20.540
 Yeah, sure, if I meet him
 in San Francisco this weekend,

22:20.573 --> 22:22.208
   I'm assured of the deal.

22:22.242 --> 22:24.077
 That's great. You tell him...

22:27.580 --> 22:29.582
   Charlie, you tell him...

22:29.616 --> 22:31.418
 I can't make it this weekend.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.120
 I'm taking my son fishing.
 Yeah.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.292
 And you will remember

22:39.325 --> 22:41.461
  to bring your books,
  won't you?

22:41.494 --> 22:43.596
   Oh, Dad!

22:51.237 --> 22:53.606
 ( instrumental music plays )
