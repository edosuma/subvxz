[bow tightening]

13:12.750 --> 13:16.333
-Who told you that?
-Uh... Mac and Daddy.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.166
-So, who is she?
-You don't know her.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.166
-Is she pretty?
-No, she's hideous.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.709
Why else would I ask her out?

13:22.792 --> 13:24.625
[grunts]
Come on, just tell me who she is!

13:24.709 --> 13:27.291
Ow! Why, are you jealous?

13:28.792 --> 13:30.375
No, of course not.

13:30.458 --> 13:34.542
-Is it that new girl in Home Ec?
-Is it Macy on the archery squad?

13:37.917 --> 13:40.625
Wait a minute.
It's that pizza girl, isn't it?

13:40.709 --> 13:43.166
Are Mac and Daddy still in trouble
or can we please go now?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.291
No, no, no, have a seat.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.041
Let me fill you guys in
on a little female 4-1-1.

13:48.125 --> 13:52.375
One guy likes a girl, cool.
Two guys like a girl, even better.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.750
Three guys like a girl, jackpot.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.083
But when all three of those guys
happen to be brothers,

13:58.166 --> 14:00.917
well, she just bought herself
a ticket on the crazy train.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.583
What are we supposed to do?
We all three like her.

14:03.667 --> 14:06.375
Well, all three of you better un-like her.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.375
We talked about it.
We can handle it.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.917
Wait, you guys think you can handle
going after the same girl?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.041
Remember when the three of you fought over
the same teddy bear

14:14.125 --> 14:15.583
you had when you were kids?

14:15.667 --> 14:17.959
-Mr. Bumble's mine!
-I got it first.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.458
-I'm the oldest.
-Mr. Bumble likes me better!

14:20.542 --> 14:21.542
Ow!

14:21.625 --> 14:23.542
-Ooh.
-Hmm.

14:23.625 --> 14:26.417
Yeah, that was one of the few times
we really got mad at each other.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.333
Yeah, and it tore you apart for a month.

14:29.417 --> 14:32.834
And this isn't a teddy bear.
This is a pizza girl. A real girl.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.125
With real arms.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.417
Guys, she's right.
We can't go there again.

14:40.041 --> 14:43.208
Good. I'm glad you've come to your senses.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.667
Come on, Macy.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.166
I like pizza too, a lot.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.500
OK, we cannot all go out with Maria
at the same time.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.542
-We'll end up fighting.
-I wish she could just come over,

14:56.625 --> 14:59.500
then hang out, and then she could decide
who she likes best.

14:59.583 --> 15:01.667
You're such a dreamer, Kevin.

15:01.750 --> 15:06.917
How about if we ask her to come over,
hang out and decide whom she likes best?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.709
-Nick, you're a genius.
-I know.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.917

-Maria should be here any minute, OK?
-[sighs]

15:26.667 --> 15:28.667
-Best behavior, right, gentlemen?
-OK.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.041
But what if one of us starts to flirt?

15:31.458 --> 15:33.250
We should have a code phrase.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.291
Something like, "The phone's ringing."

15:35.375 --> 15:36.250
Oh, I'll get it.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.291
No, that's the code phrase.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.959
If one of us says,
"The phone's ringing,"

15:41.041 --> 15:42.417
that means you're hitting
too hard on Maria.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.166
[doorbell rings]

15:44.250 --> 15:46.625
I'll bet that's Maria.
I'll get it.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.333
No, I'll get it.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.583
Let's get it together.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.291
-Hi.
-Hi, Maria, so glad

15:58.375 --> 15:59.458
you could come hang with us.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.667
You know, it felt weird coming over here
without pizza, so I brought some pizza.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.041
-Awesome.
-You're so funny.

16:13.291 --> 16:16.208
Maria, if I could rearrange the alphabet,

16:16.792 --> 16:19.917
I'd put "U" and "I" together.

16:22.208 --> 16:24.291
The phone is ringing.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.166
-I don't hear a phone.
-Me either.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.875
I'll be right back.

16:28.250 --> 16:30.500
Maria, do you like motorcycles?

16:31.333 --> 16:34.250
Because you would look great
in my sidecar.

16:34.333 --> 16:35.917
That sounds really cool.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.667
-Phone is ringing!
-There's no phone ringing.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.542
I think you've done
too many rock concerts.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.166
Poor guy.

16:43.709 --> 16:45.625
I hope you're hungry, Maria.

16:45.709 --> 16:48.542
I cooked for you.
Hope you like Crunchy Cats.

Not cool, man. That "Maria" song
belonged to all three of us.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.375
We sang it when we were happy.
We sang it when...

17:43.250 --> 17:44.542
All right, that was
the only time we sang it.

17:44.625 --> 17:45.750
Yeah.

17:45.834 --> 17:47.750
Well, I wouldn't have had to sing to her
if you hadn't brought out the motorcycle

to take her in your sidecar.

Guys, look, all of this attention

18:01.458 --> 18:06.458

the <i>sacred Book of Jonas Law.</i>

If it helps, we can explain.

It's just that all three of us
really like you.

18:34.792 --> 18:36.208

was the way to go.

a little overly competitive.
