WEBVTT

00:01.458 --> 00:05.125
(J.D.) Oh, thank God!
We were looking all over for you.

00:05.208 --> 00:07.083
Rowdy bad!

00:07.166 --> 00:09.875
I don't know why
he always goes to your door.

00:09.959 --> 00:11.583
Do you have a stuffed cat?

00:11.667 --> 00:13.792
-Nothing?
-Nada.

00:13.875 --> 00:17.000
That's 14 times we've done it to him
and not one laugh.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.417
Mark it up.

00:19.041 --> 00:22.041
Let's get going to Elliot's.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.625
(J.D.)<i> Elliot's</i>
<i>dad cut her off financially.</i>

00:24.709 --> 00:27.125
<i>Luckily, she's got friends</i>
<i>to rally around her.</i>

00:27.208 --> 00:28.792
You got any food?

00:28.875 --> 00:31.542
-How are you holding up, hon?
-Ok.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.625
Yo...

00:33.709 --> 00:36.000
talk about
"a deluxe apartment in the sky."

00:36.083 --> 00:38.291
Elliot, it would really suck
to lose this place...

00:40.083 --> 00:42.125
Then again, Elliot,
this place is...

00:43.500 --> 00:45.000
is that a jacuzzi on your deck?

00:45.083 --> 00:46.333
(sighs)

00:46.375 --> 00:48.709
Lately, I just feel like
I'm drowning, you know?

00:48.792 --> 00:50.000
(loud crunch)

00:50.083 --> 00:53.083
This pear is delicious.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.000
(mouth full)
You need help packing?

00:55.083 --> 00:57.417
(J.D.) <i>As bad as things</i>
<i>were for Elliot...</i>

00:57.500 --> 00:59.792
(loud crunch) (mouth full)
Oh, yeah, that's good.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.125
(J.D.) <i>...they were going</i>
<i>pretty well for me.</i>

01:03.250 --> 01:07.291
Well, I guarantee ya that's a simple
case of cellulitis right there.

01:07.417 --> 01:08.917
Uh, actually, Dr. Cox?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.375
I was watching TV last night,

01:10.458 --> 01:13.125
and they had this special
on flesh-eating bacteria--

01:13.208 --> 01:15.625
Necrotizing fasciitis. Yes?

01:15.709 --> 01:18.083
Yeah, I think they called it
flesh-eating bacteria

01:18.166 --> 01:20.583
to sound more flashy,
you know, hook in all the idiots.

01:20.667 --> 01:21.959
Apparently it worked.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.917
Anyhoo, point being,

01:24.041 --> 01:28.417
uh, they said it was very easy to
confuse, cellulitis with Chompers.

01:29.875 --> 01:33.000
Uh, "chompers" was the animated
flesh-eating bacteria

01:33.083 --> 01:35.000
that narrated the special.

01:35.083 --> 01:38.291
Look, Britney, recently I made
the potentially fatal mistake

01:38.375 --> 01:40.417
of getting back together
with my ex-wife,

01:40.500 --> 01:44.542
who, angel that she is, is carrying
the spawn of another man's seed,

01:44.625 --> 01:46.291
so forgive me
if I sound a tad irritable

01:46.375 --> 01:48.333
when I tell you I don't care

01:48.417 --> 01:50.917
what piece of irrelevant drivel
you picked off TV

01:51.000 --> 01:54.125
while you were snuggled up
in your Holly hobby pjs.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.500
(J.D.) <i>Come on, trust yourself.</i>

01:56.583 --> 01:57.750
I think you're wrong.

01:58.375 --> 02:01.959
-Really?
-(crash)

02:02.041 --> 02:06.291
-Well, I think you're...
-Brilliant! Necrotizing fasciitis.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.333
That's a one-in-a-million
diagnosis, son.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.500
One-in-a-million!

02:09.583 --> 02:12.250
Nah! Nothing, sir.
Anyone could've made that call.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.375
And yet... they didn't.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.041
The student becomes
the teacher, eh, Perry?

02:18.125 --> 02:19.333
(laughing smugly)

02:19.417 --> 02:22.667
-Warms my heart.
-Thank you, sir.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.458
I don't care about you, son.
I'm trying to do something here!

02:27.583 --> 02:29.792
Rat! He broke my rhythm.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.750
Now, I'm guessing this is just about
the greatest moment of your life,

02:33.834 --> 02:35.083
huh, there, newbie?

02:36.792 --> 02:39.417
(J.D.) <i>Holy crap. David Copperfield!</i>

02:40.041 --> 02:42.041
Well, definitely top 2.

02:42.458 --> 02:46.750
What's that I see in your ear?
Peh-zow!

02:46.834 --> 02:49.041
Cool. A coin.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.667
Do you want it?

02:50.750 --> 02:52.667
Here. You take it.

02:53.959 --> 02:56.875
-(chortles)
-(guffaws) Oh-ho, magic!

02:56.959 --> 02:58.792
No, top 3! Top 3.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.208
(disgusted) Oh, God.

03:00.291 --> 03:03.625
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

03:03.709 --> 03:05.250
<i>♪ No, I know ♪</i>

03:05.333 --> 03:07.542
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:15.667 --> 03:19.000
(J.D.) <i>By showing up Dr. Cox, I told</i>
<i>the world I was no longer a child.</i>

03:20.250 --> 03:21.959
<i>I was the man!</i>

03:22.959 --> 03:24.542
Great diagnosis.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.959
You! (chuckles)

03:26.041 --> 03:28.125
There's Mr. Flesh-eating bacteria!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.500
-Grr!
-(both laugh)

03:30.583 --> 03:33.792
Doctor, could you sign these,
please?

03:33.875 --> 03:36.000
Ah, sure!

03:36.083 --> 03:40.208
"To my 2 biggest fans."

03:41.583 --> 03:44.208
Yeah. They're called breasts.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.959
I know. I'm a doctor.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.458
You know, Eunice, you never even
would've made that catch

03:49.542 --> 03:51.166
if you weren't such
an all-purpose nerd,

03:51.250 --> 03:53.458
sitting home alone
on a Saturday night,

03:53.542 --> 03:56.291
watching some medical special on TV.
(chuckles)

03:56.375 --> 03:59.083
First of all, in your face
because it was Friday night,

03:59.166 --> 04:01.875
and, secondly, I would've made
the catch, regardless.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.959
You see, if you use your head
and do some homework,

04:04.041 --> 04:06.041
medicine is just--
it's basically science.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.875
(sarcastic) Oh, puh-lease
explain medicine to me

04:08.959 --> 04:11.083
because, without you,
I don't know what to do!

04:11.166 --> 04:13.583
Admitting it is the first step,
Perry. Am I right, ace?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.083
You are correct, sir!
(laughs)

04:15.166 --> 04:17.208
(whistles)
That's enough on that one.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.125
I think we've
clearly exhausted it.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.000
-Hey, stud.
-Hello.

04:21.083 --> 04:24.458
I hear wonder boy spanked your ass
harder than I usually do.

04:24.542 --> 04:27.625
(chuckling) Such a lucky fetus!

04:27.709 --> 04:29.458
Not another damn word.

04:29.542 --> 04:31.709
Yeah. I'll say whatever I want.

04:31.792 --> 04:33.709
(J.D.) <i>Hell, yeah!</i>

04:34.959 --> 04:37.417
Yes, hello? Could we
please get my hormonal,

04:37.500 --> 04:40.041
extremely annoying
ex-wife's amnio underway?

04:40.125 --> 04:42.709
Wow, I can't wait to write that down
in the baby journal.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.166
Could you be a bigger ass right now?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.959
Could you have a bigger ass
right now?

04:47.041 --> 04:49.125
-(crash)
-(Dr. Cox) Ow!

04:49.208 --> 04:50.834
Why does he keep going back to her?

04:50.917 --> 04:52.834
I don't know. Why do people keep
marrying Larry king?

04:52.917 --> 04:56.041
-The man looks like a frog.
-Look, Dr. Cox and I go way back.

04:56.125 --> 04:59.333
I just hate to see him setting
himself up to get hurt like this.

04:59.417 --> 05:00.917
I'm gonna talk to him.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.917
Here we go.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.250
What? Where we go?

05:04.333 --> 05:06.542
Sometimes you have a habit
of telling other people

05:06.625 --> 05:10.583
how to live their lives, and maybe,
possibly, sometimes,

05:10.667 --> 05:14.458
people don't appreciate that.
A little.

05:14.542 --> 05:15.625
Puh-lease!

05:15.709 --> 05:18.333
When do I ever get involved
in people's personal business?

05:18.417 --> 05:20.250
Elliot, listen to me.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.250
You have to sit down
and make a budget.

05:23.375 --> 05:24.917
You know,
I called my mom today to see

05:25.000 --> 05:27.041
if she could convince my dad
to send some cash, right?

05:27.125 --> 05:28.667
She says I should try and think
of this whole thing

05:28.750 --> 05:31.500
as some kind of opportunity
and then she hung up on me.

05:31.583 --> 05:32.583
Just like that?

05:32.667 --> 05:35.291
Well, I may have told her
that she spends more money

05:35.375 --> 05:37.125
dying her roots
than I do on groceries.

05:37.208 --> 05:40.125
Still, this whole thing is just as
much her fault as it is my father's.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.083
Neither one of them
prepared me for this.

05:42.166 --> 05:47.667
Look, Elliot, my dad's an
office supplies salesman. A bad one.

05:47.750 --> 05:50.750
So things were a little
different for me growing up.

05:50.834 --> 05:51.959
(bell rings)

05:52.041 --> 05:54.709
See, this is a bicycle <i>bell.</i>

05:54.792 --> 05:56.083
Now, you hold onto this,

05:56.166 --> 05:59.959
because I'm gonna give you
a different part every year.

06:00.041 --> 06:03.375
Maybe after the party
we can take it out for a spin.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.917
Great.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.125
Still waiting on that kickstand.

06:07.208 --> 06:10.500
It's just hard for me because
I've always had everything.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.709
I got used to it.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.875
You guys never
had to deal with that.

06:16.792 --> 06:19.166
Yeah, we're lucky.

06:19.792 --> 06:22.583
(J.D.)<i> I think patients</i>
<i>are like snowflakes.</i>

06:22.667 --> 06:24.041
<i>No 2 are alike.</i>

06:24.125 --> 06:26.417
All right, we've got
2 new admissions,

06:26.500 --> 06:30.375
both male, both mid-40s, both with
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I bet that snowflake thing
is (expletive deleted) too.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.792
I say we let super doc here
take them.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.291
Oh, are you too busy
eating sour grapes?

06:37.375 --> 06:39.375
(chuckles) Whoa!

06:39.458 --> 06:41.709
Look who peeked
in his shorts and found a pair.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.917
What, are you feeling like
you finally took on the old man

06:44.000 --> 06:45.583
in a game of one-on-one
and kicked his ass?

06:45.667 --> 06:49.583
Well, here's the news flash
there, skeech, it was a fluke.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.500
Well, believe what you
wanna believe. I'll do it again.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.542
All right. Fair enough.
Here's your chance.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.667
2 identical patients.
I say we divide them up,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.208
just like in <i>The Parent Trap.</i>

06:58.291 --> 07:01.417
One stays with the sexy,
freewheeling bachelor dad,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.125
hello, the other goes
with the whiny,

07:03.208 --> 07:06.125
neurotic, sexually repressed mom.
Oh, just you all over.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.041
Oh, and I checked
tonight's TV listings.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.083
There is no special
on that disease,

07:10.166 --> 07:12.959
so you're gonna wanna stop
at the blockbuster.

07:13.041 --> 07:18.417
Please. I know all there is to know
about Thrombotic Thromboc--

07:18.500 --> 07:21.709
cyto--cytop-top-top-
top--toppie--toppie--

07:21.792 --> 07:24.417
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.542
Yeah, baby,
just walk right by him.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.542
Ok? Just walk right by him.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.750
I'm proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.208
Dr. Cox. Hi.

07:36.291 --> 07:38.709
-Damn it, I said walk right by!
-Um...

07:39.375 --> 07:41.166
-(Turk) Hey-hey.
-Listen, um...

07:42.583 --> 07:46.291
We just think that getting back
with Jordan might be a mistake.

07:47.709 --> 07:50.959
You guys just don't seem to...
(sighs)

07:51.041 --> 07:52.458
What am I trying to say, baby?

07:52.542 --> 07:54.458
I don't know.

07:54.542 --> 07:58.000
You just don't connect
the way a couple should.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.542
Do you know what I mean?

07:59.625 --> 08:02.792
Uh, pretty much the way you
feel about it there, Gandhi?

08:03.417 --> 08:05.500
(makes "I don't know" sound)

08:05.583 --> 08:07.417
Interesting.

08:08.917 --> 08:12.250
Mr. Bragin, it is so great
to see you back in the hospital!

08:12.333 --> 08:15.166
Woo-hoo! I got a tube in my penis.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.875
Come on, you're just a
little dehydrated from the chemo.

08:17.959 --> 08:20.583
Plus, there are no signs whatsoever
of your pancreatic cancer.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.917
You should be ecstatic! I mean.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.500
(chuckling) 9 months ago I told you
you had 8 months to live, remember?

08:25.583 --> 08:27.458
I vaguely recall that.

08:27.542 --> 08:29.166
Yeah, of course you do.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.417
That is totally my fault!

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
Who knew we could cure cancer?

08:33.583 --> 08:36.166
I prepared myself, you know?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.709
I was really ready.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.291
Yeah.

08:40.375 --> 08:43.000
Dr. Reid, have you ever had to face
your own mortality?

08:43.625 --> 08:46.125
Before senior prom I tried
to wax my own eyebrows

08:46.208 --> 08:49.375
and took them both clean off.
Phht! (laughs) Yeah!

08:50.917 --> 08:54.166
And by that I mean "no." Never.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.375
Must've been a tough time for
ya, though.

08:56.458 --> 09:00.250
(sighs) Sure.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.417
Thanks for starting the solumedrol
on my T.T.P. patient.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.166
And, Laverne, I'm sorry I'm
being such a pain about this guy.

09:06.250 --> 09:09.250
It's just that Dr. Cox and I have
this little competition going and...

09:09.333 --> 09:11.959
I know that probably
seems insensitive to you--

09:12.041 --> 09:14.417
Sweetheart, you don't have
to explain yourself to me,

09:14.500 --> 09:15.917
but you better get
your story straight

09:16.000 --> 09:18.709
when you come face to face
with Jesus.

09:19.333 --> 09:24.458
(J.D.) <i>Hmm, the chart for Dr. Cox's</i>
<i>T.T.P. patient.</i>

09:24.542 --> 09:28.041
<i>I could look and see, but I'm not</i>
<i>that insecure about my--</i>

09:28.125 --> 09:30.166
Oops...

09:30.250 --> 09:32.000
I will get it.

09:32.083 --> 09:36.875
Yes! He' doing the exact same thing.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.333
(J.D.) <i>When you work in a hospital</i>
<i>and things are going well,</i>

09:39.417 --> 09:43.792
<i>you should enjoy it while you can,</i>
<i>because around every corner,</i>

09:43.875 --> 09:45.834
<i>there's something waiting</i>

09:45.917 --> 09:49.583
Dr. Reid, I need to talk to you
about your patient Mr. Bragin.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.125
Isn't it great? He's cancer-free!

09:52.208 --> 09:53.834
Yay.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.709
He's suing you for malpractice.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.041
It's ok. Relax.

09:59.125 --> 10:03.083
I told him how I felt, he listened
and nobody got hurt. It's fine!

10:03.166 --> 10:05.959
Yeah, which one of you two's been
messing with my business?

10:08.959 --> 10:10.667
(J.D.) <i>Of course,</i>
<i>every once in a while</i>

10:10.750 --> 10:13.500
<i>you manage to get away scot-free.</i>

10:13.583 --> 10:15.417
Hey, Dr. Cox!

10:15.500 --> 10:18.542
You'll be happy to know
that I did everything for my patient

10:18.625 --> 10:20.125
that you did for yours.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.750
Oh, my God, I care so little
I almost passed out.

10:22.834 --> 10:26.166
Hey, ace, your T.T.P. patient coded.
I pronounced it.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.166
He died?!

10:27.250 --> 10:30.333
I certainly hope so, otherwise
that autopsy's gonna be a bitch.

10:30.917 --> 10:33.208
-Boy, that's tough.
-What?

10:33.291 --> 10:34.500
I'd stay and talk you through this,

10:34.583 --> 10:38.417
but I gotta go check on my patient,
you see, he's still alive.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.458
How the hell did
my patient die? I mean,

10:48.542 --> 10:50.834
you started Corticosteroids,
I started Corticosteroids.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.208
You did Plasmaphoresis,
I did Plasmaphoresis.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.917
You yelled at Mark the orderly,
I yelled at Mark the orderly.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.333
-Hey, Mark.
-(mocking) "Hey, Mark."

10:57.417 --> 10:58.375
See? He's pissed.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.709
Yeah, that's because
his name is frank.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.583
Well, as far as your patient's
concerned...

11:02.667 --> 11:05.500
Well, newbie, I'm afraid you forgot
one very important thing.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.917
(J.D.) <i>For whatever reason,</i>
<i>I was finally fed up.</i>

11:08.041 --> 11:10.000
You know what? I've been working
my ass off here

11:10.083 --> 11:11.000
for the last year and a half,

11:11.083 --> 11:14.333
and the last thing I need is another
one of your condescending,

11:14.417 --> 11:17.458
never-ending speeches where you
spoon-feed me some giant lesson

11:17.542 --> 11:18.709
and call me a girl's name.

11:18.792 --> 11:22.083
Well, then, have it your way there,
Carol, 'cause I'm out.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.250
Ha, good luck, everyone.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.542
Go ahead. Walk away,

11:27.625 --> 11:30.250
because I'm not gonna
obsess about this.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.875
Can you put a rush on this autopsy?
I gotta figure this out.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.583
(crunching)

11:37.667 --> 11:40.500
You got some crumbs in his hair.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.291
A lawsuit?!

11:44.375 --> 11:46.709
So you're suing me
because you're not dying?

11:46.792 --> 11:49.041
Dr. Reid,
I didn't wanna face my mortality.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.458
You forced me to.

11:50.542 --> 11:53.625
And now I can't earn any money
because my job seems trivial.

11:53.709 --> 11:56.333
I can't be in a relationship
because what's the point?

11:56.417 --> 11:57.375
Oh, and here's the topper.

11:57.458 --> 11:59.250
Remember my horrible,
judgmental father

11:59.333 --> 12:02.667
I hadn't spoken to in 15 years?
Well, good news, doc.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.208
We patched things up, and guess
who's coming over Saturday

12:05.291 --> 12:07.959
to watch the game and tell me
what a jerk I am?!

12:08.041 --> 12:09.959
Well, you asked me to estimate
how much time you had left!

12:10.041 --> 12:11.208
And you told me
I'd be dead by now!

12:11.291 --> 12:12.667
Well, you're not!
So sue me!

12:12.750 --> 12:15.125
I am! It was a figure of speech!

12:15.208 --> 12:16.959
And your dad was right about you!

12:17.041 --> 12:19.750
-Why don't you tell him yourself?
-Hey, ass-face.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.375
Hi ya, pops.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.083
Excuse me. Ma'am!

12:26.166 --> 12:27.709
Jordan!

12:27.792 --> 12:30.375
Carla has something
she'd like to tell you.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.083
Carla...

12:32.166 --> 12:34.000
I didn't mean to upset you,

12:34.083 --> 12:36.959
even though everything I said
was true and you know it.

12:37.041 --> 12:40.166
Baby, that is a Godawful apology.
That is just Godawful.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.083
It's 'cause she's not really sorry.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.458
Honey, I know your type.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.959
It is so easy to see
other people's problems

12:46.041 --> 12:47.417
from way up there
on your pedestal.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.083
But you better
be careful up there,

12:49.166 --> 12:51.291
'cause if you fall off
and have to walk around down here

12:51.375 --> 12:52.625
with the rest of us,

12:52.709 --> 12:54.792
I don't know, you might
catch a glimpse of yourself

12:54.875 --> 12:57.375
in a mirror
or the surface of a pond,

12:57.458 --> 13:00.959
your boyfriend's gigantic,
shiny head

13:01.041 --> 13:03.667
and trust me, you're
not gonna like what you see.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.333
-My head's not...
-Ow.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.709
-That...
-Ow.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.291
A little help here!

13:11.917 --> 13:15.250
Sorry, kid.
I didn't see anything unusual.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.166
Couldn't he have bled out
or had an M.I.?

13:17.250 --> 13:18.834
I don't know.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.083
I didn't look for any
of those basic things

13:21.166 --> 13:22.917
because I'm horrible at my job.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.083
-Dr. Walch.
<i>-Murder, she wrote.</i>

13:25.166 --> 13:27.125
Ok, fine, you caught me.
I'm checking on my patient.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.875
-How is that guy doing?
-Not great.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.041
(pager beeps)

13:33.125 --> 13:35.208
What in the hell is going
on in here?

13:35.291 --> 13:36.792
The amnio triggered
premature labor.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.333
Excuse me, she's only 24 weeks.
Jordan, cut it out right now!

13:39.417 --> 13:41.834
-Is he yelling at me?
-Yes, he is.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.917
I'm gonna give you
a shot of terbutaline.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.500
And you know what else?
He said I had a fat ass before.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.959
The nice kind?

13:50.583 --> 13:54.291
Look, I don't get
a lot of women in here.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.291
What's your honest opinion
of these drapes?

13:57.917 --> 14:00.250
They're fine, Ted,
but I'm getting sued.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.625
You're right.
You're right, you're right.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.166
-Now, by "fine"--
-Ted!

14:05.250 --> 14:06.875
Ok, um...

14:07.667 --> 14:09.750
Just t-time to calm down now.

14:09.834 --> 14:10.959
I'm fine.

14:11.041 --> 14:12.959
Actually, I was
talking to myself.

14:13.834 --> 14:18.792
Now, uh, you haven't discussed the
lawsuit with Mr. Bragin, have you?

14:18.875 --> 14:20.375
A lawsuit?!

14:21.000 --> 14:23.667
It, uh--it sort
of came up, yeah.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.959
Oh, God!

14:26.041 --> 14:27.959
Tell me you didn't
antagonize him...

14:28.041 --> 14:30.000
So sue me!

14:30.083 --> 14:32.083
(Ted) Or admit fault!

14:32.166 --> 14:34.125
That is totally my fault.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.166
Oh, come on!

14:36.250 --> 14:38.375
A good lawyer
couldn't win this case!

14:38.458 --> 14:41.959
Ah, new drapes.
They're awful.

14:42.041 --> 14:45.083
(whining) Dr. Kelso, why does
everything keep happening to me?

14:47.667 --> 14:49.750
(gently) Take a breath, Dr. Reid.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.667
In... (inhales)

14:51.750 --> 14:55.041
and out... (exhales)
That's it. That's it.

14:55.125 --> 15:00.834
Now, you went to 4 years of college
and 4 years of medical school,

15:00.917 --> 15:04.709
so I can safely presume
that you are at least 8.

15:05.333 --> 15:08.542
(disgusted) My God, little girl,
grow up and say

15:08.625 --> 15:11.500
"how do" to the world
of modern medicine!

15:11.583 --> 15:12.667
My God,

15:12.750 --> 15:15.333
I've been sued 4 times.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.333
Come on, Ted, let's go.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.875
Let's go!

15:21.875 --> 15:24.250
I think you should just go in there
and apologize to her.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.875
No! I didn't say anything
that wasn't true!

15:26.959 --> 15:28.917
I just wanna see if she's ok.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.709
She's fine.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.291
Laverne, would you please
have the nurse

15:50.375 --> 15:51.875
covering Jordan page me
the moment she wakes up?

15:51.959 --> 15:53.709
-Sure.
-Thank you.

15:53.792 --> 15:57.250
Hey, Dr. Cox! I'm sorry.
I was just so frustrated before.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.500
So, now I'm here.
Why don't you go ahead

15:59.583 --> 16:02.417
-and tell me what I forgot.
-Can I?

16:02.500 --> 16:04.417
-Really?
-Sure. Hit me.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.417
-How about go to hell, Shakira?
-What?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.834
What, now that you've decided
you're ready to listen?

16:09.917 --> 16:11.333
How's it work, huh?

16:11.417 --> 16:12.792
Are you gonna pull
a string on my back?

16:12.875 --> 16:15.000
Well, step right up
and give it a tug,

16:15.083 --> 16:18.083
but I'm warning ya, I bet it keeps
coming up "go to hell, Shakira."

16:18.166 --> 16:19.709
Why do you always
have to be like that?

16:19.792 --> 16:22.208
You know that I try harder
than anyone in this place,

16:22.291 --> 16:23.417
and you never
give me any credit.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.208
Now, you listen to me, newbie.

16:25.291 --> 16:27.959
I'm not doing this because I get
my jollies off of being your mentor,

16:28.041 --> 16:29.542
and I'm damn sure not doing it

16:29.625 --> 16:32.458
so that years from now I can say,
boy, I knew him when.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.291
I'm doing it because if I don't,
people would die.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.542
Thanks for your help.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.959
You know what, Mr. Bragin?
I figured something out.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.917
-That damn nurse broke my bed.
-That's just it.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.500
You blame everyone else for anything
that goes wrong in your life.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.500
Like this.
The nurse didn't break your bed.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.208
You just press this button.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.625
All right, it is broken.

16:57.709 --> 16:59.875
The point is, if you hate your job,
maybe you need to switch careers.

16:59.959 --> 17:01.166
If you can't get
into a relationship,

17:01.250 --> 17:03.166
maybe you have problems
with commitment. Huh?

17:03.250 --> 17:05.333
And I know that I'm right,
'cause I'm the exact same way!

17:05.417 --> 17:07.208
I blame my parents for not
preparing me for the real world,

17:07.291 --> 17:09.417
I blame this hospital
for taking up all of my time,

17:09.500 --> 17:11.458
I'm even blaming you
for jeopardizing my future!

17:12.083 --> 17:13.041
But you know what?

17:13.125 --> 17:16.834
It's time for me to grow up and
start holding myself accountable.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.542
And I'm doing it.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.834
Good for you.

17:20.917 --> 17:24.583
You're, um, still suing me,
aren't you?

17:24.667 --> 17:27.542
Yeah, but I feel like now
you'll be able to handle it.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.709
(click-click-click)

17:31.333 --> 17:32.750
(Turk) You know what?

17:32.834 --> 17:34.667
We're just gonna
have to get him fixed.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.166
Good news is,
he doesn't need to go to a vet,

17:37.250 --> 17:38.917
'cause we can just pop
these things right off.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.709
(chuckles)

17:41.959 --> 17:42.875
Yes!

17:42.959 --> 17:46.625
Baby, you have got to tell J.D.,
because he is not gonna believe it!

17:46.709 --> 17:48.458
Jordan was right about me.

17:48.542 --> 17:51.375
I'm insecure, and I judge people
to cover up for it.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.792
I mean, even right now,
all I can think about

17:53.875 --> 17:55.291
is to tell you that
you're a surgeon now,

17:55.375 --> 17:56.625
and if you wanna
be taken seriously,

17:56.709 --> 17:58.583
you have to start
acting like an adult.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.000
You had to say all of that?

18:00.083 --> 18:01.750
Well, you have a habit
of not listening to things

18:01.834 --> 18:03.083
unless people spell them out
for you.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.125
-Oh, my God. I can't stop.
-Baby,

18:06.208 --> 18:08.000
maybe it's something you need
to work on, that's all.

18:08.083 --> 18:10.542
Sweetie,
I promise you I will never ever

18:10.625 --> 18:12.333
tell you what to do ever again.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.667
Yeah, you will.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.583
But with me it's ok
because I love ya.

18:19.583 --> 18:20.917
Besides...

18:21.834 --> 18:23.083
I barely listen anyway.

18:23.709 --> 18:25.917
Come on, rowdy, let's go, boy!

18:26.000 --> 18:28.083
Let's head up to the fourth floor.

18:30.417 --> 18:34.000
Oh! Whoa, boy! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, boy! Slow down!

18:36.291 --> 18:37.291

19:35.375 --> 19:36.792
That thing that you forgot?

19:38.166 --> 19:41.959
Turns out, whatever you know
about medicine, ultimately,

19:42.041 --> 19:44.792
luck or fate
or God or who-knows-what

19:44.875 --> 19:46.709
is always gonna end up
playing a much bigger role

19:46.792 --> 19:49.291
in the whole thing
than you or I ever will.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.792
Hell, it was lucky you were watching
that show the other night.

19:51.875 --> 19:55.750
And it was unlucky that your
patient went the other way...

19:56.250 --> 19:58.208
Even though you did
absolutely everything right.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.542
And, for the record, you did.

20:02.917 --> 20:05.834
I was looking over your shoulder
every step of the way.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.125
Thanks.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.959
It wasn't a favor, newbie.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.208
It was my job.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.792
