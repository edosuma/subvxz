00:02.127 --> 00:04.421
- [blender whirring]
[blender stops]

00:04.504 --> 00:06.673
- Hey, how are you making
a smoothie?

00:06.756 --> 00:08.633
We're all out of fruit.
- Ah, I rummaged around

00:08.717 --> 00:10.844
and found a kiwi in
the back of the fridge.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.929
[laughing]

00:13.012 --> 00:16.683
Um! Something's
off about that kiwi.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.101
- Who took my
fuzzy tangerine?

00:18.184 --> 00:21.938
I was growing mold
for a science project.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.357
- That would be it.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.151
- Hey, kids, how was school?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.403
- Amazing. I sat at
the cool kids' table.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.488
- Did they catch you?

00:30.572 --> 00:32.031
- They invited me.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.658
- You weren't already cool?

00:33.742 --> 00:36.119
I always thought you were cool--
and I know cool.

00:36.202 --> 00:40.331
- No offense, Dad, but you're
like the global warming of cool.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.916
- None taken.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.918
- Until now, I was
at this table.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.503
I was kind of not anything--

00:45.587 --> 00:47.464
not nerds, not jocks,
not brains.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.841
- Hm, we used to call that
the "odds and ends" table.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.677
At our school,
that's where all the lo...

00:52.761 --> 00:55.638
...ooonatics sat.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.016
Didn't save it, did I?

00:58.099 --> 01:00.310
- Hey, Steph, I assume
you were at the cool table.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.353
- Oh, honey, I wasn't
"at" the cool table.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.522
I ruled the cool table.
- GABBY: [laughing]

01:05.607 --> 01:08.777
- Hey, I married a girl
who ruled the cool table.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.236
You know what
that makes me?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.864
- Lucky?

01:12.947 --> 01:14.741
- So, what turned you
cool all of a sudden?

01:14.824 --> 01:16.951
- I was throwing out
my sandwich, right?

01:17.035 --> 01:20.205
- Hold up. You threw
out the sandwich I made you?

01:20.288 --> 01:22.207
- Been there.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.083
- Did I say "sandwich"?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.169
I meant "napkin."
I always get those confused.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.505
Anyway, I didn't
wanna get up,

01:28.588 --> 01:31.424
so I did a Frisbee to the trash
can--totally missed.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.218
But before I could
pick up the...

01:33.301 --> 01:36.596
napkin, Mr. Swaine
stepped on it.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.515
- Okay, that's what
this story's about?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.850
You got cool because
some lunch room teacher

01:40.934 --> 01:43.353
stepped on my
lovingly-crafted sandwich?

01:43.436 --> 01:46.564
- No, I got cool because
he slipped on it just as,

01:46.648 --> 01:48.983
and I kid you not,
the lunch lady walked by

01:49.067 --> 01:51.152
with a big old thing
of split-pea soup.

01:51.236 --> 01:57.158
Then went down and everybody
cheered because...come on.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.160
- Well, are they
all right?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.746
- They're fine.
Stay with the hero, Dad.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.998
So then, Frankie, the coolest
kid at the cool table,

02:04.082 --> 02:05.917
goes like this...

02:06.000 --> 02:09.336
and just like that,
I'm cool!

02:09.419 --> 02:11.589
- That won't last.
They'll figure you out.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.174
- Maybe, but until
that happens,

02:13.258 --> 02:15.552
I'm gonna ride the cool train
to Popularville.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.346
Woo! Woo!
First up, Jealous Junction.

02:18.429 --> 02:22.934
Oh, hey, Gabby.
Woo! Woo!

02:23.017 --> 02:25.478
- Hey, wanna play a game?
- Sure.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.355
- [cellphone beeps]
- Oh, wait.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.649
I'm sorry, I can't play
with you right now.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.526
Noah's coming over.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.903
- Tell him to turn around.
We're playing Yummy Tummy Town.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.447
- Oh, he even texted
me a little ghost--

02:36.531 --> 02:39.534
because I'm his boo.
[laughing]

02:39.617 --> 02:40.994
- Hey, uh, where do you
think I would have sat

02:41.077 --> 02:42.704
in the lunch room
of your school?

02:42.787 --> 02:45.540
- Um, with the super cool kids
who loved science and math.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.250
- [laughing]
That's what I'm talking about.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.002
- You know those kids
weren't actually cool.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.254
- Yes, I do!

02:51.337 --> 02:58.136
- ♪

02:58.219 --> 02:59.512
♪ Yeah Hey ♪

02:59.596 --> 03:05.226

{\an8}- Woo! Woo!

03:14.861 --> 03:16.779
{\an8}- How's life at your
little 7th grade cool table?

03:16.863 --> 03:17.947
{\an8}- Legendary. You remember
I told you about Frankie?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.867
{\an8}- Uh-huh, the coolest
cool kid.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.452
{\an8}- He just got cooler.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.287
{\an8}He pulled this
amazing prank.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.623
{\an8}He locked Mr. Swaine
in the boys room.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.125
{\an8}The funniest part is
Swaine didn't have his cellphone

03:29.208 --> 03:32.629
{\an8}so he was stuck in the school
bathroom overnight.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.964
{\an8}- Frankie should not
have done that.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.633
{\an8}It was cruel and wrong.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.844
{\an8}- Why are you talking like
a public service announcement?

03:39.928 --> 03:44.807
{\an8}- To find out more, log on to
ParentsStandingBehindYou.org.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.352
{\an8}- So, did Frankie get expelled
or just suspended?

03:47.435 --> 03:48.645
- Neither. Nobody knows
he did it.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.147
- You know.
- I know I'm not telling.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.232
- James, what Frankie did
to Mr. Swaine was dangerous.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.234
You have to tell
the principal.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.278
{\an8}- Have you lost
your mind, woman?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.030
{\an8}Snitches end up in ditches.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.032
{\an8}- Charlie, are you
hearing this?

04:01.115 --> 04:02.659
{\an8}- Yeah, what I'm
hearing is

04:02.742 --> 04:04.786
{\an8}James didn't do it
and nobody got hurt.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.245
{\an8}- What?

04:06.329 --> 04:08.247
{\an8}- That's how we roll
at the hospital.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.917
{\an8}If something gets left
inside someone--zip!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.919
{\an8}- Charlie!
- I can't rat on Frankie.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.837
{\an8}I'll be banished
from the cool table.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.005
And since I dumped the guys
at the odds and ends table,

04:17.089 --> 04:18.507
I can't go back there.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.176
- Isn't it better to have
a clean conscience,

04:20.259 --> 04:21.928
than a place to set your tray?

04:22.011 --> 04:23.012
- If I snitch on Frankie,
I'll have a place all right--

04:23.096 --> 04:25.348
eating my lunch behind
the dumpster

04:25.431 --> 04:28.351
with that kid "Mucous Lucas."

04:28.434 --> 04:30.687
- James, sit down.
I'm gonna tell you a story.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.689
- [groaning]

04:32.772 --> 04:35.024
- A story about a girl
with regrets.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.527
- [groaning]

04:37.610 --> 04:38.903
- Back when I was
in middle school,

04:38.987 --> 04:40.780
I had a classmate
named Melissa.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.574
She had a bit of
an equine quality.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.077
- She had a horse face.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.663
- It's like she escaped from
the merry-go-round.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.206
- BOTH: [laughing]

04:50.289 --> 04:52.208
- CHARLIE: [clears throat]
- Anyway...

04:52.291 --> 04:53.209
when the yearbooks
came out,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.254
a friend of mine had
replaced her picture

04:56.337 --> 04:58.256
with one of
an actual horse.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.882
- Did you tell on her?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.884
- No. Covering seemed
cool at the time,

05:01.968 --> 05:03.386
but when I think about
poor Melissa,

05:03.469 --> 05:05.221
it really haunts me.

05:05.304 --> 05:08.725
I can't even watch
the Kentucky Derby.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.852
- So, what you're
saying is...

05:10.935 --> 05:14.939
you've been "saddled"
with this for years.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.233
- Not the time, Charlie.

05:17.316 --> 05:20.987
James, I can't let you live
with that kind of guilt.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.239
- Meh.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.908
- No, I mean, I am not
going to let you.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.910
If you don't tell
the school, I will.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.746
Then let's see how
cool you are

05:29.829 --> 05:32.206
when it gets out your mommy
does your ratting for you.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.916
- All right, fine.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.918
I'll slip an anonymous note
under the principal's door.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.087
- Well, you're doing
the right thing, son.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.591
When a crime goes
unpunished, nobody wins.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.926
Or "places" or "shows."

05:48.473 --> 05:50.266
- Hey, Gabby,
look what I found.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.017
Yummy Tummy Town
--our favorite.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.102
Wanna play?
- Noah's here.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.688
- It's more of
a two-person game.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.317
But I guess he can
shuffle the cards.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.445
So should I set
it all up?

06:02.528 --> 06:04.655
- Oh, wait, sorry, Aaron.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.117
I just remembered Noah and I
had to do that thing.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.619
- What thing?

06:09.702 --> 06:14.123
- That thing we have to do
upstairs--alone.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.501
- That upstairs alone thing--

06:16.584 --> 06:18.127
that thing got moved
to the kitchen.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.215
With me in the doorway
staring at it.

06:27.762 --> 06:31.140
- Hey, Dad, what would make
a girl stop liking a guy?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.976
- Is somebody having himself
some girl troubles?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.978
- You can say that.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.106
- Well, it's important
to be respectful.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.817
Girls don't stay
with guys that are

06:40.900 --> 06:42.944
a lot of fast talk
and cheap thrills.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.822
- Uh-huh, fast talk.
Cheap thrills.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.825
- Okay, that sounds weird coming
back from a nine-year-old.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.327
Let me try again.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.995
You've gotta be honest.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.666
You've gotta be more than
smoke and mirrors.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.876
- No smoke. No mirrors.
Thanks, Dad.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.379
I figured out what to do.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.339
- Glad I could help, son.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.675
Hey, guess pretty
soon it'll be time

07:05.758 --> 07:07.927
to have that big talk
about the birds and the bees.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.222
- Don't need it.
I'm pretty good with animals.

07:11.305 --> 07:15.059
[sighing] It's men
and women that confuse me.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.561
- [laughing]

07:16.644 --> 07:19.021
- There's my favorite
couple!

07:19.105 --> 07:20.815
- Huh? You just saw us.

07:20.898 --> 07:24.068
- Whoa, slow down,
Mr. Fast Talker.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.697
Some of us speak
at a normal pace.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.198
- Aaron, what's going on?

07:29.282 --> 07:32.410
- What's going on is
Noah's thrills are so cheap,

07:32.493 --> 07:35.413
they're practically
two-for-one.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.331
- What are you
talking about?

07:37.415 --> 07:38.374
- I'm trying to get her to see
through all your mirrors.

07:38.457 --> 07:43.462
I mean, smoky mirrors.
[coughing, sputtering]

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506
- Wanna get some time
alone out back?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.884
- Okay, I'll wait for
you outside.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.262
But you're gonna have
to ditch this guy.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.438
- [sighing]
Where's Frankie?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.440
- Didn't you hear?
He got suspended.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.482
- Some kid told
the principal that Frankie

08:03.566 --> 08:06.402
was the one who locked Swaine
in the bathroom.

08:06.485 --> 08:07.987
- Some kid? Meaning you
don't know who it was?

08:08.070 --> 08:12.074
Do you know who it was?
Because it could be anyone.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.453
- We don't know, but when we
ascertain who the perpetrator is

08:15.536 --> 08:18.414
there's going to be
quite a confrontation.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.249
- Dude, tone it down.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.252
We're the cool table,
not the brainiac table.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.921
- Yeah, when we let
you do our homework,

08:25.004 --> 08:26.422
you promised
you'd act cool.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.507
- Right, right, when we find
out who the rat is,

08:28.591 --> 08:31.719
we're gonna sew that chicken's
lips together.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.429
- Wait, is it a rat
or a chicken?

08:33.511 --> 08:35.097
- Are you making fun
of the snitch?

08:35.181 --> 08:37.433
- No, I'm just trying
to figure out

08:37.515 --> 08:39.352
what kind of lips
we'll be sewing.

08:39.434 --> 08:42.270
- We're offering $11
and six arcade tokens

08:42.355 --> 08:44.607
to whoever tells us
the snitch's name.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.027
- Whomever.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.363
What?

08:50.446 --> 08:53.115
- Does it bother anybody
that we're asking someone

08:53.199 --> 08:55.284
to snitch on a snitch?

08:55.368 --> 08:58.496
- He raises an interesting
ethical question.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.289
- What's your
problem, Petey?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.791
- Nothing.
I'm just saying.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.293
- What are you saying?
Are you the snitch?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.795
- No, I'm not the snitch.

09:05.878 --> 09:09.966
- That's exactly
what the snitch would say.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.636
- I think it's safe to
infer that Petey is the snitch.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.346
- I am not the snitch!

09:15.429 --> 09:18.641
- If it's not you,
then who is it?

09:18.724 --> 09:22.228
- STEPH: James?
- What? No! Did not!

09:22.311 --> 09:25.606
- Hey, James, isn't
that your stepmom?

09:25.690 --> 09:28.651
- Stop being nosy, snitch.
- Yeah.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.653
- Stephanie, what are
you doing here?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.321
- You forgot your lunch.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.322
- You didn't find
it strange

09:33.406 --> 09:36.492
that I forgot it
in the trash can?

09:36.575 --> 09:38.995
- That's why I made you a new
one that I bought at a deli.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.330
Trying to tell me
I can't make a sandwich.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.207
- Thank you and goodbye.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.668
- Is that the cool table?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.378
Which one's Frankie?

09:47.461 --> 09:49.338
- Frankie got suspended

09:49.422 --> 09:52.341
because someone made someone
tell someone something

09:52.425 --> 09:55.261
and now the cool kids
think that someone

09:55.344 --> 09:57.638
is this guy named Petey.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.682
- Oh, wow, it's gonna
be terrible for Petey.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.851
You cannot let them
keep thinking that.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.352
- Sure, I can.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.937
- James, let me tell
you a little story.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.524
- Oh, don't you have two other
stepkids you can torture?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.613
- Hey, thanks for
getting all that fruit.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.907
- Oh, sorry we're all
out of yogurt.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.200
- We are?
[laughing]

10:18.284 --> 10:19.702
Then what's in--
You know what?

10:19.785 --> 10:24.623
I don't want to know.
I'm already on my third one.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.625
- Hey, James.
How'd it go with Petey?

10:26.709 --> 10:27.918
- How do you think it went?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.004
Ugly. The full
silent treatment.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.631
Name calling. Threats.
Rude noises.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.258
- How is that
the silent treatment?

10:34.342 --> 10:36.761
- Because I remained
silent the whole time.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.429
- Who's Petey?

10:38.512 --> 10:41.223
- The guy who got blamed for the
snitching Steph made me do.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.309
- James, isn't there any way
to get Petey off the hook?

10:43.392 --> 10:44.352
- The only way to get
him off the hook

10:44.435 --> 10:47.813
is if I tell
them it was me.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.483
But then they'll take the hook
and beat me with it.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.818
Thank you, Stephanie.
This is all your fault.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.612
Now, if you want me,
I'll be upstairs.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.864
Hopefully, I can make it--

10:56.947 --> 10:59.992
carrying the weight of
the world on my shoulders.

11:00.076 --> 11:05.122
- I know he's upset, but why is
he taking it out on me?

11:05.206 --> 11:05.956
Say something, Charlie.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.918
- Zip!

11:09.001 --> 11:11.295
- You'd better get back
here and unzip.

11:11.379 --> 11:16.467
- Any chance that means what
I'm...hoping it mean?

11:16.550 --> 11:18.761
- None.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.553
- Here's the thing.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.806
You were a cool kid.
- Exactly.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.349
That's why I know
what he's going through.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.476
- No, you have no idea
what he's going through.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.477
You were always a cool kid.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.397
The rest of us went
through school

11:29.480 --> 11:30.523
thinking the bottom could
fall out at any minute.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.817
- Really? Why would
you think that?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.443
- Because of people
like you.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.028
You don't understand.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.279
Kids wanna be at
the cool table so badly,

11:37.363 --> 11:40.074
they'll do anything to get there
and even more to stay there.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.617
- Ach, that's silly.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.660
If you don't like what's
happening at the cool table,

11:42.743 --> 11:45.663
you just get up and leave--
- [heavy sigh]

11:45.746 --> 11:47.665
- --and then you start
a new cool table.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.209
I started four of 'em.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.336
- Ahhhhhh!

11:58.300 --> 12:00.136
- Who wants to put down
that schoolbook

12:00.219 --> 12:03.472
and pick up a game of
Yummy Tummy Town?

12:03.556 --> 12:06.267
- Okay, why not?
- Great!

12:06.350 --> 12:08.519
- You gonna set it up now?
- [doorbell rings]

12:08.602 --> 12:12.148
- Oh, hang on.
- Come on!

12:12.231 --> 12:14.859
- Noah?
- Hey.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.069
I got this text from you.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.196
- [reading] "Noah,
don't ever come over again.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.865
"I am breaking up with you

12:20.948 --> 12:25.327
"because I'm in love
with President Barack Obama.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.038
"He is my boyfriend now.

12:28.122 --> 12:31.542
Oh, well, sorry."
Crispy shrimp emoticon.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.210
Crispy shrimp emoticon?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.839
- You know, because your
relationship is fried?

12:36.922 --> 12:41.635
Uh, that's what I would mean,
if I had sent that.

12:41.719 --> 12:45.347
- Seriously, Aaron?
The President?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.766
- I went big.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.936
- Aaron? What is
going on with you?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.563
- Go easy, Gabby.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.648
I think Aaron's just being
protective of his sister.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.942
It's all good, little man.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.445
- Your boyfriend's trying
to punch me very slowly.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.616
You should break up with him.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.494
- Aaron, since you used to
be my favorite brother,

13:06.577 --> 13:08.329
I'll give you five minutes

13:08.412 --> 13:09.330
to collect as many toys
as you can hold,

13:09.413 --> 13:11.916
before the rest of them go
in the fireplace.

13:11.999 --> 13:12.917
- Gabby, it's not
that big a deal.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.961
- Us breaking up is
not a big deal to you?

13:16.045 --> 13:17.755
- But we're not,
so just calm down.

13:17.838 --> 13:21.217
- Calm down? Don't tell me
to calm down.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.053
- I'm just saying what Aaron
did is a little funny.

13:24.136 --> 13:28.057
- Oh, this is funny to you?
Oh, this is a big joke.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.434
Oh, I guess I'm just
boo-boo the fool.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.062
Knock-knock, who's there?
Noah. Noah who?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.981
That's what I'll be
saying at school tomorrow.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.109
I can't believe him!
- Who needs a boyfriend--

13:39.193 --> 13:42.154
when you've got
Yummy Tummy Town!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.865
- I'm too upset
to play now, Aaron.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.076
- I did not see
that coming.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.750
- Okay, if I sit here?
- Yeah.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.544
- Phillips, what are
you doing?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.921
- Yeah, we don't consort
with snitches.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.091
- Consort? Dude!

14:02.174 --> 14:04.718
- Yo, snitch, tell on
anybody lately?

14:04.802 --> 14:08.180
- [food thuds]
- Ha, ha, way to go, man.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.515
- Yeah.
- Nice.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.808
- How are you holding up?
- [sighing]

14:10.891 --> 14:13.394
I'm okay--my mom said
the real snitch

14:13.477 --> 14:14.645
will start feeling
guilty and confess.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.481
- My stepmom says
a lot of things

14:17.565 --> 14:18.524
she doesn't know
anything about, either.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.610
Want my pudding?
- Thanks.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.404
- It's the least I can do--

14:23.487 --> 14:25.739
not that I'm required
to do anything.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.616
- Snitches don't
eat pudding...

14:27.700 --> 14:30.286
they wear it!

14:30.369 --> 14:32.913
- Ho, ho, way to go, man.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.332
- All right, you guys
just stop it.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.251
You don't even know
if Petey was the snitch.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.711
And even if he was,
maybe he had a good reason.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.130
Maybe he has an annoying
family member

14:41.213 --> 14:43.591
who wouldn't shut up about
him doing the right thing.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.884
Shouldn't we all just stop
and think about that?

14:50.222 --> 14:53.350
- Ho, ho, ho, ho.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.687
- Butterscotch.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.235
Hey, you want a snack?
- Anything but pudding.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.403
- I hear you, but barely.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.780
I've still got butterscotch
in my ears.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.367
- Hey, thanks for
having my back today.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.244
- Men who wear pudding together,
stick together--

15:12.328 --> 15:15.414
literally.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.374
Dad, Steph, this
is my best bud, Petey.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.792
- Oh, Petey.
You guys are friends?

15:18.876 --> 15:20.878
- Yeah, we've been
through some stuff.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.465
- And, James, he was
really there for me.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.507
- Well, how do
you like that,

15:25.591 --> 15:28.594
Mr. Bottom-will-fall-out-
if-James-comes-clean?

15:28.677 --> 15:30.346
He's fine.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.058
Nobody cares that he was
the one that told on Frankie.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.727
- Uh-oh.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.604
- What?!

15:38.687 --> 15:42.191
You're the snitch and you
let me take the blame?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.943
- In my defense, what happened
to you was terrible.

15:45.027 --> 15:49.198
And I did not want
to experience that.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.200
- Well, get ready
for lots of it.

15:51.283 --> 15:55.079
- Petey, man, we're
brothers in pudding!

15:55.162 --> 15:57.706
- Later, snitch!
[chomping]

15:59.708 --> 16:03.754
- Hey, don't just
drop that apple!

16:03.837 --> 16:06.215
They don't grow on trees.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.676
Well, they do, but it's
still wasteful.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.890
- Hey, Gabby.

16:14.973 --> 16:18.811
I got nobody.
You got nobody.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.022
I'm thinking
Yummy Tummy Town!

16:22.106 --> 16:23.273
I'll let you go first.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.066
- I'm not in the mood.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.443
- Man, what is it
gonna take?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.986
- Why are you so obsessed
with this game?

16:28.070 --> 16:30.781
- Because you don't play
it with me any more.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.243
You don't do anything
with me any more.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.953
You're always with Noah.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.038
- Well, what about last week
when we went to the park?

16:38.122 --> 16:40.290
- You cancelled to hang
out with Noah.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.377
- Oh, that's right.
We went to the park.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.628
Okay, I was
wrong for that.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.423
How about I make
it up to you.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.341
Yummy Tummy Town
right now.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.844
- I'm the blue tummy!

16:51.927 --> 16:54.930
- Okay, so, how do we play?

16:55.013 --> 16:57.266
- We spin to go
down this path.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.602
And if you land on a star,
you get a "Yummy" card.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.688
You don't remember?
- Nope, not at all.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.189
I've never played
this game before.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.191
- We used to play this
all the time.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.569
- I've never seen this game
before in my life.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.945
- Come on, we used to play this
every Saturday night

17:11.029 --> 17:12.489
until I fell asleep.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.492
By the time I woke up,
you'd be gone because...

17:15.576 --> 17:20.414
[gasping] You were
Janice the babysitter!

17:20.497 --> 17:24.167
Oh, okay, my bad.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.211
- Really, Aaron?

17:26.295 --> 17:29.298
- Now I remember. You and I
used to play checkers.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.843
Wanna play checkers?
- Sure.

17:32.926 --> 17:38.223
- [doorbell rings]
- Are you kidding me?

17:38.307 --> 17:41.810
Are you double
kidding me?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.061
- Hey...

17:43.145 --> 17:44.354
I'm sorry about
yesterday.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.149
- Me, too. The whole thing
was ridiculous.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.359
- I know.
- I know?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.111
What do you know?

17:51.195 --> 17:53.197
That you were ridiculous
or I was ridiculous?

17:53.280 --> 17:55.115
- Whichever one works.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.950
- Apology accepted.
- Thank you.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.995
- [sighing] So, wanna
go see a movie?

18:00.078 --> 18:02.498
- Yeah. Oh.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.667
Hey, Aaron,
wanna come with?

18:05.751 --> 18:08.670
- Unh, I don't know.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.839
Sure, I'll come!

18:12.966 --> 18:15.803
- Hey, snitch!
[smacks James' head]

18:15.886 --> 18:19.389
- Nice one!
- Way to go, man.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.061
- Oh, no, you don't!

18:24.144 --> 18:28.232
This is a perfectly
good ham and jelly.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.025
- Are you serious?

18:30.108 --> 18:32.152
Please don't tell me you came
here to check on me.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.612
- What? No.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.740
I thought I'd drop by school
to brush up on my math.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.536
I had to divide 600 by 18
and I was like what?

18:40.619 --> 18:41.912
Stay in school, everybody.

18:41.995 --> 18:45.207
- Stephanie, what are
you doing here?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.542
- [heavy sigh]
Okay.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.378
I felt bad.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.296
I didn't want you to have
lunch by yourself.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.758
- Having lunch with my stepmom
will help me how?

18:54.842 --> 18:56.510
- You wanted to sit
at the cool table,

18:56.593 --> 18:59.137
so I'm bringing
the cool to you and...

18:59.221 --> 19:02.933
some string cheese.
- I do love string cheese.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.310
Uh-oh, cool girls,
ten o'clock.

19:05.394 --> 19:05.936
Don't look them
directly in the eye.

19:06.019 --> 19:10.440
I hear you turn to stone.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.317
- I'd die for
those earrings.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.444
But my mom's like,
oh, no.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.737
- Moms, right?

19:15.821 --> 19:18.240
- Please, stop. Please, stop.
Please, stop.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.492
- And love that top.
Can we sit with you?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.412
- Don't stop. Don't stop.
Don't stop.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.080
- I mean, if you want.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.290
Whatevs.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.795
- Hey, Steph, I got
it from here.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.882
String cheese, m'lady?

19:37.384 --> 19:40.053
- Charlie, you should have seen
me with the girls today.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.891
They all wanted to be me--
just like old times.

19:43.974 --> 19:44.766
- Hey, Steph, can you
make me a snack--

19:44.850 --> 19:48.520
that's not a sandwich.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.856
- Oh, sweetie, not now.
I'm talking to your Dad.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.984
- Okay. I get it.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.235
I know what to do!

19:57.571 --> 20:00.866
- Anyway, Charlie, they're the
coolest girls in the lunch room

20:00.949 --> 20:03.827
and I think I'm
their leader now.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.787
- You do realize that you're old
enough to be their--

20:05.871 --> 20:08.749
- Their what, Charlie?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.417
- Um, their really hip
and cool aunt?

20:10.500 --> 20:14.713
- Exactly. That's why I'm taking
them to the mall tomorrow.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.840
- Hm.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.342
- Oh, uh...

20:18.425 --> 20:21.303
Hm, apparently, you're
dumping me for...

20:21.386 --> 20:23.805
President Barack Obama?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.515
- Wow, I am having
a good day.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.311
Wait 'til the girls in the lunch
room hear about this!
