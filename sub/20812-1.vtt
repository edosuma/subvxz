00:14.547 --> 00:15.781
We said we would change.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.117
Ain't I been waiting, Rick?

00:18.119 --> 00:20.152
Don't make me do this.

00:20.154 --> 00:24.123
I need to know if there is
something here worth saving.

00:42.275 --> 00:43.642
It's nice to see that family

00:43.644 --> 00:45.110
is still important
to some people.

00:45.112 --> 00:46.812
You hear things about someone,

00:46.814 --> 00:48.714
but they never really add up

00:48.716 --> 00:53.318
until you get them right in
front of you, face to face.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.120
How much is this gonna cost me?

00:57.757 --> 01:00.392
Just $15,000, but before we
get to the money, you have to...

01:00.394 --> 01:02.194
I wanna hear it from him.

01:02.196 --> 01:06.365
Okay, well he... he is the key
to this whole thing, but...

01:06.367 --> 01:10.602
Good, good, because I wanna
hear him tell me.

01:10.604 --> 01:15.107
Um, so, have you ever been
to the farmer's market?

01:15.109 --> 01:16.575
No.

01:16.577 --> 01:20.579
Hey Charlie,
you ready for another?

01:20.581 --> 01:24.283
You know a man of lesser character
would've cut me off by now, man.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.252
You're my best customer.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.254
Just wait until your
lunch time crowd comes,

01:29.256 --> 01:31.423
you'll forget all
about old Charlie.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.193
You are the lunch time
crowd, buddy.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.862
Yeah, cheers to that.
Shots?

01:36.864 --> 01:40.532
The farmer's market,
is like this dope ass place

01:40.534 --> 01:42.167
where they sell a bunch
of organic shit.

01:42.169 --> 01:46.371
It's like this big fuckin',
uh,...

01:46.373 --> 01:48.740
Think non-corporate
free-trade capitalism.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.642
Honest business
without the middle man.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.650
- Thanks.
- Cheers buddy.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.666
So Nikki was like...

02:14.668 --> 02:18.704
We were thinking that maybe I
could open up a stand there, too.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.812
Hey barkeep.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.647
What'll it be, darlin'?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.149
I don't know, what's good?

02:30.151 --> 02:31.617
Order a bloody Mary.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.586
I always like it when girls
order bloody Marys.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.855
And why's that?

02:36.857 --> 02:39.625
Because I'd never order
one myself, I guess.

02:39.627 --> 02:43.795
They're sexy and something
mysterious about them.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.498
I'll have a bloody Mary.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.333
Aww, ain't that sweet?

02:48.335 --> 02:51.937
We've got a flat light beer,
a flat dark beer,

02:51.939 --> 02:53.805
something kind of in the middle,

02:53.807 --> 02:55.207
and we got something
sort of Belgian.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.808
Sort of?

02:56.810 --> 02:59.945
Yeah, well the light beer
comes out of the Belgian tap.

02:59.947 --> 03:03.348
I guess it's the flat
light shit then.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.184
A girl after my own heart.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.252
This is gonna blow your mind.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.321
What's the first thing
that inevitably happens

03:09.323 --> 03:13.525
when you shop
at the farmer's market?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.627
You eat all the delicious fruit!

03:15.629 --> 03:17.362
- Get this.
- Three words for you.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.899
Fruit. Cobbler. Stand.

03:28.208 --> 03:32.511
You want me to give you
$15,000 for fruit cobbler?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.481
- Yes.
- Yeah.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.884
Let's just slow down
a little bit,

03:38.886 --> 03:42.688
because I get a feeling you guys might
be going a little too fast for me.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.825
So, I buy fruit, let's say
an apple or an orange.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.227
Maybe even a pineapple.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.394
Don't like pineapple.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.430
Well, but you could,
if you wanted...

03:51.432 --> 03:53.498
Which we've established
I don't, right?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.401
So I buy fruit, let's say,
an apple or an orange

03:56.403 --> 03:57.769
and your business model
is you're going to take it

03:57.771 --> 03:59.871
and you're gonna cut it
into slices for me.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.373
If you wanna bring that
pineapple back into the mix...

04:01.375 --> 04:02.774
Again, I don't want
fucking pineapple,

04:02.776 --> 04:05.310
I want apples and oranges,
so tell me, Brian,

04:05.312 --> 04:07.913
how much is this going
to cost me, the consumer?

04:09.816 --> 04:12.351
- Two fruits would probably be...
- Again, wasn't talking to you.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.519
I was talking to Brian,
my brother.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.855
Brian, tell me, how much
is this going to cost me

04:16.857 --> 04:18.824
for you to take
my apples and oranges

04:18.826 --> 04:20.524
and cut them into slices for me?

04:22.362 --> 04:23.895
Uhh...

04:24.931 --> 04:26.932
Five dollars?

04:26.934 --> 04:29.334
And how much is the knife?

04:31.904 --> 04:33.338
I already own a knife.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.275
So what the fuck
is the $15,000 for?

04:41.681 --> 04:43.582
Well, looks like it's just
me and you, sugar.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.558
I think it's a fucking
awful idea.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.360
Well, this is the first
step towards

04:55.362 --> 04:57.663
localizing the return of
the goods and services economy.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.732
There are no goods
and the only services rendered

05:00.734 --> 05:03.635
is my idiot brother slicing up
apples and oranges for me.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.504
Oh he can do a lot more
than just slice.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.673
Oh, I bet he can.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.975
No, you weren't there
when my girlfriend told me

05:09.977 --> 05:14.413
she was leaving me
for a spoon salesman.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.049
If you don't know what
a spoon salesman is, well,

05:17.051 --> 05:21.453
a spoon salesman,
he sells fucking spoons.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.789
That's what
a spoon salesman does.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.857
I'm glad my shitty life's
amusing to you.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.493
No, it's not that.

05:28.495 --> 05:32.998
You're just refreshing to me,
that's all.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.335
Tell me something, Nikki,
why am I even talking to you?

05:36.337 --> 05:37.769
I don't even know who you are.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.605
Dude, don't be like that,
she didn't do anything.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.809
No, you didn't do anything.
You never do anything.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.544
Only this time,
you not doing anything

05:45.546 --> 05:48.747
got you hooked up
with some trailer tart

05:48.749 --> 05:50.349
who's trying to take
money out of you

05:50.351 --> 05:53.652
that you don't actually have.
Well done, bro.

05:53.654 --> 05:58.490
Honey, she told me our
relationship had gotten stale.

05:58.492 --> 06:02.894
She said that I was stale.

06:02.896 --> 06:07.065
That's not true. Dude, there's no way.
It's a lie.

06:09.969 --> 06:13.438
You know nothing about
community building

06:13.440 --> 06:17.943
and creating something
organic and beautiful.

06:17.945 --> 06:21.113
That's right, I don't, but the
cobbler commander over here,

06:21.115 --> 06:22.647
I'm sure,
is well-versed in it.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.383
This is why we never agree, man.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.851
- Exactly.
- Just no...

06:25.853 --> 06:28.720
Just wait, just wait,
okay, listen.

06:28.722 --> 06:32.491
Don't go. Okay?
He needs you.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.928
You know what I think?

06:36.930 --> 06:39.831
I think you need me.

06:39.833 --> 06:46.838
So you put him up to this and that
makes you a very, very bad person.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.075
You have a sickness.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.179
I can smell it on you.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.049
Just please.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.652
Get your fuckin' hand off me.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.421
But I hate when that happens.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.605
Where's the bartender?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.641
In the back maybe,
how should I know?

07:22.643 --> 07:23.875
Well, you got yourself
a full drink there,

07:23.877 --> 07:25.911
I thought you'd
be a safe bet to ask.

07:25.913 --> 07:29.080
Trust me, I ain't a safe bet.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.017
Hey! Why don't you make
yourself useful

07:32.019 --> 07:36.621
and go get the bartender?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.857
You got that or you need me
to write it down for you?

07:41.160 --> 07:44.663
Go get the fuckin' bartender.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.131
Wow.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.537
Yeah, you treat most girls
like that?

07:52.539 --> 07:55.640
I don't know, you most girls?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.042
Why don't you turn
that ass around,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.744
we'll find out right quick.

07:59.746 --> 08:05.116
Hey, no,
what's your problem, man?

08:05.118 --> 08:07.519
Wow.

08:07.521 --> 08:11.990
Wow, your boyfriend's
a little drunk, huh?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.592
Maybe you oughta take
him home, tuck him in,

08:13.594 --> 08:16.561
before something goes
and happens to him.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.530
He ain't my boyfriend.

08:18.532 --> 08:22.534
Well, maybe it's you
needs tucking in, then?

08:22.536 --> 08:24.202
I'm sure we'd both like that.

08:26.138 --> 08:29.941
Oh Jesus. Hey! Hey!

08:29.943 --> 08:31.543
What?

08:31.545 --> 08:32.844
There's some fucking
asshole out there

08:32.846 --> 08:34.746
lookin' for a bartender
and being a jerk.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.947
Well tell him to keep
his fucking pants on.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.649
He just grabbed my fucking ass

08:37.650 --> 08:38.650
and he's getting into it
with all the other customers,

08:38.652 --> 08:40.085
the few we actually have.

08:40.087 --> 08:45.223
Jesus Christ, okay.
I'll be out in just a sec.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.992
Were you...

08:48.227 --> 08:51.162
Were you just masturbating
in here?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.865
What? No! No I wasn't
masturbating.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.235
I mean, do whatever you want, sometimes
when I get bored, I'm not judging.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.538
- Okay, good talk.
- But not at work!

08:59.540 --> 09:02.173
Come on, hit me then.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.042
You know you want to.

09:04.044 --> 09:08.179
This isn't the 1970s, okay?

09:08.181 --> 09:10.015
All right.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.585
Cheers.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.901
There ya go.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.336
Officially been provoked.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.143
Oh, my gosh.

09:40.646 --> 09:44.249
Okay, well, we really should
do this again sometime.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.750
Sit your ass down.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.691
Your move.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.859
Hey, calm the fuck down, okay?

09:54.861 --> 09:57.629
Relax, buddy.

09:57.631 --> 09:58.663
Relax, man.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.298
Relax.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.103
Trust me, amigo, I'm relaxed.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.974
Get sweet pea over here to do me a solid.
Yeah, you.

10:08.976 --> 10:12.143
Come on over,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.845
Closer.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.647
Come on.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.382
I wanna feel your breath
on my face.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.920
I want you to lock
that door tight.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.755
Is there a back door
to the exit?

10:23.757 --> 10:24.889
Yeah.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.057
Is that all of them?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.626
Just the one.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.861
When you're done with the front,
do the back.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.731
You leave, she dies.

10:34.233 --> 10:38.103
Because I care about
these people,

10:38.105 --> 10:40.105
this town,

10:40.107 --> 10:41.773
these streets,

10:44.276 --> 10:46.211
this badge,

10:46.213 --> 10:48.279
this badge
means something, Pete.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.748
It's a privilege.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.821
They sleep sound
in their beds at night

10:56.823 --> 11:00.859
because they know that I'm out
there looking out for them,

11:00.861 --> 11:03.261
and because you're out
there with me.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.666
Because that's what we do.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.001
That is what we do.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.705
Meryl fucking Streep.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.174
- Oh.
- Uh huh.

11:16.176 --> 11:20.145
Really? Like, uh, like
"river wild" Meryl Streep?

11:20.147 --> 11:24.315
I was gonna say "deer hunter,"
but "river wild" works, too.

11:24.317 --> 11:28.019
Wow. Killed it.
Killed it. Yeah.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.988
You should lead
with that tonight.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.956
- You think so?
- Definitely.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.727
Don's gonna give you
thespian of the week tonight.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.028
I crushed it.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.901
- I'm that good of an actor.
- Yes.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.703
Toss them in.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.178
What about you?

11:53.180 --> 11:56.147
I actually don't have a phone.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.817
I mean, I got
a calling card, but...

12:02.188 --> 12:06.925
Hey Hajiv, that means you too.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.727
Waitin' on you.

12:08.729 --> 12:09.928
There ya go.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.931
Cocksucker.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.200
How about you, compadre?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.835
He doesn't speak English, man.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.738
Yeah? Does he speak gun?

12:19.740 --> 12:20.939
Just leave him the fuck alone.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.273
All right.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.047
You got a name, barkeep?

12:32.118 --> 12:34.853
You know, where are we anyway?

12:34.855 --> 12:37.522
My friend, we're on the clock.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.859
But nobody said we can't
make it go a little faster.

12:40.861 --> 12:43.648
We're just gonna check
out this bar for a bit.

12:43.673 --> 12:45.130
No, are you serious?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.898
And just grab a few
for the road.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.767
No, we can't be
drinking on the job.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.168
- Why not?
- What are you, crazy?

12:50.170 --> 12:53.004
No, we've been warned
way too many times.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.774
- You heard my uncle, -yeah, I
heard him, but who's gonna know?

12:55.776 --> 12:58.877
We're just gonna go
investigate a few beers

12:58.879 --> 13:00.845
and then we'll be right
back at it.

13:00.847 --> 13:03.314
I don't... I do not like it.
You know why?

13:03.316 --> 13:05.183
Because we have a good temporary
thing going on here you know look?

13:05.185 --> 13:08.253
Do you remember when
he called you the worst cop

13:08.255 --> 13:12.891
he's seen in his entire
professional life?

13:12.893 --> 13:15.460
He also called us
"team foreskin."

13:15.462 --> 13:18.396
- Because we rub him the wrong way.
- What?

13:18.398 --> 13:23.902
Look, we're not any good at
this, but that's okay.

13:23.904 --> 13:28.473
They gave us guns and badges
and the whole shebang, and why?

13:30.209 --> 13:31.910
Happenstance?

13:31.912 --> 13:34.913
No, because we look the part.

13:34.915 --> 13:39.384
So now we, talented actors,
are stuck keeping watch over

13:39.386 --> 13:43.922
what is not the most peaceful
square mile in all of California.

13:43.924 --> 13:49.227
- No. -I mean this place
looks like Chechnya.

13:49.229 --> 13:53.164
- Like that Chinese place.
- No, not the Chinese place.

13:53.166 --> 14:00.038
We can either go inside or we can
take another loop around the ghetto.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.873
Your choice.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.109
Safety.
Potential dying.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.614
Anybody does something stupid...

14:09.616 --> 14:12.183
And she's the one that suffers.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.386
Now you're gonna want
to remember this part,

14:15.388 --> 14:17.922
you may walk away
from here today,

14:17.924 --> 14:21.526
but run as far as you can and the
memories of what happened to her

14:21.528 --> 14:26.497
under your watch will forever
be two steps behind you.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.133
And I shit you not.

14:29.135 --> 14:33.004
That is is a fate worse
than death itself.

14:33.006 --> 14:37.275
Do we have ourselves
an understanding?

14:37.277 --> 14:39.277
I'm looking for some feedback
here on this one.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.612
Yes.

14:40.614 --> 14:44.449
Better. Now how about you,
Harry Potter?

14:44.451 --> 14:48.086
- Do you think you can handle that?
- Leave him alone.

14:48.088 --> 14:53.091
Oh. Oh yeah.
I'll leave him be.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.425
I'm serious.

14:57.196 --> 14:59.998
Leave her alone, all right?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.599
Just let her go.
I said all right.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.903
Look like you got
yourself a fan.

15:04.905 --> 15:08.072
Lucky day.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.009
"Jonny's sweet revenge."

15:11.011 --> 15:13.478
What the fuck is this?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.613
I literally just explained that.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.483
Is this one of your oriental
massage parlors?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.418
Seriously?

15:28.594 --> 15:33.431
This place is always open.
Yeah, so weird.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.600
Hey, let's bus out
and get a smoothie.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.269
- I don't want a smoothie.
- I do.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.274
You and your George Clooney
hair, get whatever you want.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.977
Why don't you go ahead and get yourself
back behind that register there

15:45.979 --> 15:47.011
and we're gonna get started.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.413
Take it easy, man.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.449
Take your time.
I've got all day.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.452
What are you smiling at,
fuck face?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.287
- Sorry man, nothing
- shut up.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.161
Where you get your haircut at?
Supercuts?

16:03.163 --> 16:05.296
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

16:07.266 --> 16:10.335
That's it. Now take it
and get the fuck out of here.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.636
Where's the rest of it?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.304
That is the rest of it.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.373
Where's the rest?

16:15.375 --> 16:17.642
Guys, I've got like 50 bucks in
my pocket, you're welcome to it.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.478
- Did I ask you to speak?
- Nope.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.580
No, do not answer.
That was a rhetorical question.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.415
I want to see the fucking rest
of it, there's gotta be more,

16:24.417 --> 16:25.516
I wanna see the fucking rest.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.752
Ask him if there's a safe.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.487
Yeah, what about a safe?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.322
You got like a safe in here
or something?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.358
Yeah. There's a safe
in the back office,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.693
but it's fucking empty,
you can take my word on that.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.029
The boss is fucking selling
the place next month.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.031
We're closing? When were you
gonna let me know?

16:40.033 --> 16:41.366
Shut up, tits McGraw.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.134
You can sing me a song later,
all right?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.535
I wasn't supposed to say
anything,

16:44.537 --> 16:46.371
but given the circumstances...

16:46.373 --> 16:48.339
Look, man, what the fuck
do you want from me?

16:48.341 --> 16:51.009
God damn it, Reni!

16:51.011 --> 16:52.610
How the hell
was I supposed to know

16:52.612 --> 16:55.279
there's short
of 40 bucks in the drawer?

16:55.281 --> 16:56.481
Because this is
your fucking idea.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.049
I didn't want to do any of this.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.584
Oh yeah, well it hardly
took any convincing.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.786
That's 'cause just like always,

17:01.788 --> 17:03.621
- I just go along with the stupid
shit that you do. -Like always?

17:03.623 --> 17:07.724
Oh, I didn't know my life was
a complete farce to you, Rick.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.560
Please regale everyone
in the bar.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.363
What other stupid things of mine
do you blindly go along with?

17:12.365 --> 17:16.800
Oh, hmm, I don't know,
how about moving to Los Angeles

17:16.803 --> 17:18.603
so you could open a designer
cupcake boutique?

17:18.605 --> 17:21.204
- How about that one?
- How was that stupid?

17:21.207 --> 17:23.441
You sold like five cupcakes
in the first three months

17:23.443 --> 17:25.376
and they were all to fucking me.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.377
How the hell was
I supposed to know

17:27.380 --> 17:29.781
that people don't eat
that shit out here?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.516
It's called market research.

17:31.518 --> 17:34.118
Market research? You should
ask these guys about that.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.654
They have the market cornered
in market research.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.556
Nobody asked you,
so shut the fuck up.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.626
Oh yeah, yeah, take all your
shortcomings out on other people.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.295
That's so fucking you.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.297
Shortcomings?
What are you talking about?

17:46.299 --> 17:49.734
Was I the only one who failed
at what I set out to do?

17:49.736 --> 17:53.204
Oh, no, no, I forgot. You are the
king of the fucking west coast.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.340
Reni, I work like three
fucking jobs

17:56.342 --> 17:59.710
and I go to night school, okay?
What else do you want from me?

17:59.712 --> 18:01.479
End the circus, please.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.215
I was going to pay for
that chicken sandwich

18:04.217 --> 18:07.452
and give a tip to her
because she was really good.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.620
- Thank you.
- Shut the fuck up.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.556
What the fuck is your problem?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.425
Sit your fucking ass down.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.796
Sit your ass down.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.300
Hey, hi, over here.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.168
I'm a bit confused.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.871
This beautiful girl right here,
she's my girlfriend.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.173
Calamity Jane is supposed
to be the victim I make off with

18:29.175 --> 18:32.343
along with the dozens of retirement
dollars that we just acquired.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.113
It's a basic fake hostage
robbery, you know,

18:35.115 --> 18:38.583
nobody gets hurt. What part
of this don't you understand?

18:38.585 --> 18:41.853
All of it, maybe?

18:41.855 --> 18:43.888
You hit me in the face
for no reason.

18:43.890 --> 18:49.360
Oh no, there was definitely
a reason, okay?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.561
Somebody has to get hit
in the face,

18:50.563 --> 18:53.464
and today,
that somebody was you.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.534
Now stop being
such a whiny little bitch.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.568
That's vintage, Rick.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.771
Everyone, round of applause.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.874
Nope, stop fucking clapping.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.810
Passive aggressiveness
at its finest,

19:05.812 --> 19:08.312
hiding behind a veil
of spite and sarcasm

19:08.314 --> 19:11.849
bringing others down around you to
avoid handling your own feelings.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.819
Doctor Judith was absolutely
right about your ass.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.622
Oh really? And when the fuck
did Dr. Judith say this, huh?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.390
Oh, oh, so you don't
even deny it.

19:19.392 --> 19:24.395
No. Why the fuck am I paying
this person top dollar

19:24.397 --> 19:26.197
to talk shit behind my back
when I'm not even fucking there.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.666
Because you are so out of touch
with your emotions

19:28.668 --> 19:30.835
it's fucking crazy.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.238
- Out of touch. -Sometimes I wonder
if you even have a fucking pulse.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.673
Disconnected, really?

19:35.675 --> 19:38.276
I just robbed a fucking bar
on a whim for you.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.610
Because I fucking love you.

19:39.612 --> 19:43.881
Is it love for me?
Or hate for yourself?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.349
Doctor Judith was so...

19:51.623 --> 19:53.591
What were you saying
about doctor Judith?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.793
Nah.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.828
Did that just sound
like a gunshot?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.498
I don't really know what
a gunshot sounds like.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.933
Probably somebody's
hoopty blasting

20:01.935 --> 20:03.868
through an intersection.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.937
You think maybe we should
go check it out?

20:05.939 --> 20:08.973
No, that's what red light
cameras are for.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.878
I'd like to let it be known
that I am

20:13.880 --> 20:17.481
deeply, deeply
in touch with my emotions.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.616
Can I get an amen?

20:18.618 --> 20:20.885
Who here likes fiction?
Anyone?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.354
Well, that's because to you, everyone
is out of touch with their emotions

20:23.356 --> 20:26.424
because if we weren't, doctor
fuckhead wouldn't have any clients.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.925
Don't you see what's
happening here?

20:27.927 --> 20:30.828
Nope, not everyone is
disconnected, just you.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.730
- Oh, is that a fact?
- 100%.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.633
Oh, please expand on that,
by all means

20:35.635 --> 20:38.502
because we have all fucking day.

20:38.504 --> 20:41.872
Can I please just finish
my fucking lunch?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.274
That is my favorite
chicken sandwich.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.809
No, you can't.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.010
Now sit down and shut up.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.411
Take Charley.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.947
N-n-no,
don't take Charley.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.550
Charley is deeply in touch
with his emotions.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.953
He was telling me all about
his girlfriend, his life,

20:55.955 --> 20:57.521
shit that matters to him.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.990
Ex-girlfriend, actually.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.791
All that?

21:00.793 --> 21:02.360
He said all that to you?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.428
In the ten minutes you were
in here, huh?

21:04.430 --> 21:07.465
Tell... tell him about the spoons Charley.
I want him to hear it.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.534
Yeah, tell me about
the spoons, Charley.

21:10.536 --> 21:13.804
Tell him.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.807
We were happy or I thought
we were happy.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.576
She apparently wasn't happy

21:18.578 --> 21:20.411
because, like,
out of nowhere she told me

21:20.413 --> 21:25.516
that she needed to leave me
for someone else and...

21:25.518 --> 21:28.753
That's heartbreaking.

21:28.755 --> 21:32.657
And meanwhile, I'm holding a gun
at people in a fucking dive bar

21:32.659 --> 21:34.025
on account of your boredom.

21:34.027 --> 21:37.461
I-I-i found out he sells spoons,
all right?

21:37.463 --> 21:39.797
Fucking spoon salesman?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.365
You mean like, door to door?

21:41.367 --> 21:44.468
I have, honestly, no freaking
idea all right?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.673
Hey, CHICO.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.642
You get much in the way of spoons
salesmen around these parts?

21:51.644 --> 21:53.377
I'm asking you
a fucking question.

21:53.379 --> 21:56.580
I already told you he don't
speak no English, man.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.384
He doesn't order anything,
he just sits.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.386
He's actually one
of our better customers.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.688
This is the kind of joint
you rob, bro.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.824
He's spooning my girlfriend,
okay?

22:06.826 --> 22:09.627
And you never went after her?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.329
Find this fucking guy
and did anything about it?

22:11.331 --> 22:13.731
What's there to do?

22:13.733 --> 22:16.901
Fucking kill him to death with a
spatula or something how's that?

22:16.903 --> 22:21.038
- Why? -Because she's
your fucking girlfriend.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.874
There wasn't anything
left anymore.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.476
Bullshit.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.111
I call coward.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.613
He is not a coward.

22:29.615 --> 22:32.083
Oh, sure he isn't, whatever.

22:32.085 --> 22:33.884
Oh yeah?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.788
That was definitely a gunshot.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.790
You know, I think you're right.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.993
Should we, just, you know, maybe
go investigate or something?

22:42.995 --> 22:44.495
Are we supposed to do that?

22:44.497 --> 22:46.997
I think so.

22:46.999 --> 22:51.001
Well, okay, we should probably
take the guns then.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.804
What do you mean? You're always
supposed to take the guns.

22:53.806 --> 22:57.475
Seriously? I've been keeping mine
in the glove box the whole time.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.645
What are you, an idiot?
Why would you ever do that?

23:01.647 --> 23:04.415
I don't know, I've got,
like, a thing about it.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.818
A thing? What thing?

23:07.820 --> 23:12.556
Like, if I'm taking a shit, I might
kick my pants and shoot my balls off.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.558
That thing.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.761
How do I look?

23:16.763 --> 23:18.963
Be honest.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.498
You look legit.

23:22.434 --> 23:23.734
Wait.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.076
How do I look?

23:33.678 --> 23:35.813
Like a young Charles Bronson.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.949
No, that doesn't work.
He's got like a mustache.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.951
So what if he's got a 'stache?

23:40.953 --> 23:46.724
He's got a mustache. If Meryl
Streep were a dude, she'd have one.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.760
True, but I was thinking more...

23:51.963 --> 23:53.931
Like John McClane.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.600
What do you think? Right?
Yeah, come on.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.936
I was thinking more
John McClane.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.572
What's so funny?

24:01.574 --> 24:07.511
You are as much Bruce Willis as I am
Eddie Murphy in "Beverly hills cop".

24:07.513 --> 24:10.214
Yeah, okay, okay.

24:10.216 --> 24:13.184
Eddie Murphy in "Norbit," maybe.

24:13.186 --> 24:16.454
- I'll fucking Norbit you.
- Whoa, okay Norby me.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.889
Oh yeah.
Your safety's on, buddy.

24:18.891 --> 24:21.158
- Norbit somebody...

24:21.160 --> 24:22.993
Fire that gun
one more time, huh?

24:22.995 --> 24:25.129
- I dare you.
- Or you'll what?

24:25.131 --> 24:26.997
What are you gonna do about it?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.966
A lot more than Freddy fucking
feelings over there,

24:28.968 --> 24:30.201
I tell you that much.

24:30.203 --> 24:32.236
Freddy...
What's your name again?

24:32.238 --> 24:33.871
Charley.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.807
Charley is more of a man
than you'll ever be.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.509
That's not true.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.244
- That guy right there?
- Mm-hmm.

24:40.246 --> 24:45.816
- Uh-huh? -Yep, because
real men have courage.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.718
This guy right here?
This guy's courage?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.587
Real men confront their problems

24:49.589 --> 24:52.723
and courage is a fundamental
thing of which you lack.

24:52.725 --> 24:53.958
This is courage?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.826
Nope.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.128
Does anybody else here think

24:58.130 --> 25:01.499
that this is what
courage looks like? Anybody?

25:01.501 --> 25:05.536
Please tell me that I'm not
out of my fucking mind here.

25:05.538 --> 25:06.971
Oh, sandwich guy.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.873
I totally agree.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.574
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

25:10.576 --> 25:14.612
Honestly, I could give
less of a shit.

25:14.614 --> 25:20.084
I will agree with anyone who gets me
back to that table and my fucking lunch.

25:20.086 --> 25:24.121
And then I don't have to listen
to you idiots anymore.

25:25.790 --> 25:28.926
Well, this is what's
happening now.

25:28.928 --> 25:31.028
Oh, as if anyone needed me
to point this out,

25:31.030 --> 25:34.865
Rick, here, suffers from some
insane anger management issues.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.234
Eat your fucking sandwich.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.637
Yeah, well living with a person
like you will do that.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.205
Another classic defense
mechanism,

25:41.207 --> 25:42.940
it's called displacement.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.643
Uh-huh.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.778
- Please don't hit me again, oh god.
- Shut up.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.684
This.

25:53.686 --> 25:57.688
This is placement,
not displacement,

25:57.690 --> 26:00.858
now you see doctor Judith
is wrong yet again.

26:02.928 --> 26:03.928
You're being passive aggressive.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.964
Nope, I am proving a point.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.132
Give me your hand, Charley.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.934
I don't know what you're doing.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.671
I'm gonna help show everyone
just how courageous you are.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.307
I'm not.

26:16.309 --> 26:20.978
Now, you're gonna stand
there, okay.

26:22.647 --> 26:25.215
You're gonna aim this gun,
put it right in his gut

26:25.217 --> 26:29.587
and you're gonna point it
at Mr. Hajiv, all right?

26:29.589 --> 26:32.690
Right about now, you're gonna
feel your balls drop.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.992
Get nice and tight and heavy,
all right?

26:34.994 --> 26:37.628
It's called fun and excitement.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.196
- I don't wanna.
- No.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.899
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.

26:41.901 --> 26:45.169
Well, welcome to the world
of dating.

26:45.171 --> 26:48.939
By golly, I think our boy's
gone and grown up.

26:48.941 --> 26:53.077
Now be quiet
and eat your fucking sandwich.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.385
- You asshole.
- Hey, I'm sorry.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.254
- What the fuck are you...
- Hey, come here.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.390
- I'm sorry, buddy. -Jesus,
what's wrong with you?

27:06.392 --> 27:08.792
- I didn't do...
- That is your fault.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.995
- I turn right. You turn left.
- We practiced so much!

27:10.997 --> 27:13.197
- I always...
- We practiced, man.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.666
Shh, we have a situation,
shut up.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.402
I swear to god!

27:18.404 --> 27:20.971
If you do that again,

27:20.973 --> 27:24.008
I'm going to shit in my pants.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.176
I'm sorry, it scared me a bit.

27:26.178 --> 27:30.080
- Please focus, for god's sake!
- Sorry. I'm trying!

27:30.082 --> 27:31.415
Why are you still talking?

27:31.417 --> 27:35.386
Sit down, eat your fucking
sandwich.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.187
- Okay.
- Eat your sandwich.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.856
Okay.

27:38.858 --> 27:42.059
All right, you're gonna open
the door

27:42.061 --> 27:43.193
and I'll just startle
them from behind.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.262
Oh, so more hostages?

27:45.264 --> 27:47.197
Oh yeah, yeah, we just keep
piling them up in here

27:47.199 --> 27:48.399
until we get lost
in the crowd, huh?

27:48.401 --> 27:51.268
You have a better fucking idea?

27:59.310 --> 28:00.678
Hey, howdy.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.348
- Hey sir.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.016
What the fuck is going on here?

28:06.018 --> 28:09.219
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.354
Pete, he has a gun.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.922
- It's okay.
- He's got a gun.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.758
- It's okay, I got him.
- No, no, behind you.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.226
Over here.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.062
Why the hell you
pointing it at me?

28:18.064 --> 28:19.997
Because he's standing
right behind you.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.401
- The bullet can't just go around you.
- Oh god.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.737
Do you not know physics?

28:26.739 --> 28:27.738
Put the gun on her.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.807
Oh, wow.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.842
What a fuckabout.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.845
Okay, folks, we have a bit
of a situation here,

28:34.847 --> 28:36.527
so why don't we all
just take a deep breath

28:38.884 --> 28:40.784
and chill or whatever

28:40.786 --> 28:43.287
and somebody explain
what's happening

28:43.289 --> 28:45.989
and we'll work through this.

28:45.991 --> 28:49.960
Listen, those two assholes
are robbing this bar.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.195
Fucking sellout.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.363
I don't even fucking
know you, pal.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.165
You're not my family.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.334
Like you'd know anything
about that.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.104
- Now is not the time, sweetheart.
- Yep, you know what? It is.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.940
Because I saw you, when he pulled his
gun you went straight for the door.

29:02.942 --> 29:06.176
She's right, man, you don't give a
shit about anyone except yourself.

29:06.178 --> 29:09.880
Hey guys, hey, over here.
Can you do that later?

29:09.882 --> 29:11.415
Yeah, thank you.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.883
Uh, there's a situation.

29:12.885 --> 29:16.019
Yeah, um, let's start with you.

29:16.021 --> 29:18.822
You with the very large
gun over there,

29:18.824 --> 29:23.260
why don't you put it down
and let's talk.

29:25.063 --> 29:27.297
Oh, I can't.
They're making me courageous.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.934
Okay, that makes no sense to me,

29:30.936 --> 29:32.970
but whatever!
We can work with it.

29:32.972 --> 29:38.175
That over there
is detective Jack Callahan

29:38.177 --> 29:39.843
and I'm Pete Taverez.

29:39.845 --> 29:43.313
We're here to diffuse
the situation

29:43.315 --> 29:47.117
and I don't know, not let shit get
more fucked up than it already is.

29:47.119 --> 29:53.524
So, um, let me hear you say
everything's going to be okay.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.425
Everything's gonna be okay.

29:55.427 --> 29:58.328
Not you, him.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.931
Okay, stay calm,
everything's gonna be okay.

30:00.933 --> 30:04.868
Everything's gonna be okay.

30:04.870 --> 30:09.573
Good, now, we're all gonna
talk about this

30:09.575 --> 30:12.209
like a bunch
of highly civilized...

30:18.184 --> 30:20.417
Why the fuck would you do that?

30:20.419 --> 30:22.853
I didn't mean to!

30:25.123 --> 30:27.958
I'm sorry. I just was
trying to pay attention...

30:30.429 --> 30:32.563
Under no circumstances were you
supposed to do that, Charley.

30:32.565 --> 30:37.267
Can we put him back together? Can we?
He's gonna be okay, right?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.969
No, he's not gonna
be fucking okay.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.405
You just blew his head off,
all right? He's dead.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.512
Please don't arrest me.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.848
Please don't arrest me.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.917
Why? Do, do, do,
please don't arrest me.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.630
This guy's like really,
really dead.

31:06.632 --> 31:10.300
Probably shorter
than he was this morning.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.269
True.

31:12.271 --> 31:16.340
Look, I don't know how far
you've looked ahead

31:16.342 --> 31:18.575
or if you've even thought ahead,

31:18.577 --> 31:20.911
but this guy's got some sort of middle
eastern Asian thing going on, right?

31:20.913 --> 31:23.380
So what, we were just hanging
around with some white boys

31:23.382 --> 31:27.484
who were executing an Arab
in a dive bar?

31:27.486 --> 31:29.319
This isn't fucking Alabama.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.589
Yeah, that certainly
adds a few wrinkles.

31:32.591 --> 31:36.026
A few? Many.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.395
Many wrinkles, Pete.

31:39.464 --> 31:41.131
Cover up?

31:44.068 --> 31:46.603
Definitely cover up.

31:46.605 --> 31:50.908
Okay, we're gonna have
to do a few things here,

31:50.910 --> 31:53.677
first...

31:53.679 --> 31:56.079
Honestly, enough of that
already.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.149
Come on, look at what we're
already dealing with.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.984
Stop.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.353
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

32:03.355 --> 32:09.226
We're gonna need everyone's
cooperation to fix this situation.

32:09.228 --> 32:13.530
If our boss...
If our bosses...

32:13.532 --> 32:18.068
If our bosses come in here and
see that we've let this happen,

32:18.070 --> 32:21.238
we're done, right, Pete?
We're fucking done.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.207
- See, detective Taverez and I...
- Mm-hmm.

32:24.209 --> 32:28.979
We have a really nice pension
plan and health benefits

32:30.214 --> 32:32.549
hopefully this will work
its own self out.

32:32.551 --> 32:37.120
Myself and detective Callahan,
we're going to head out in a bit

32:37.122 --> 32:39.189
and keep the perimeter clear,

32:39.191 --> 32:43.961
just in case of things
happening.

32:43.963 --> 32:46.096
Why the fuck should
we listen to you guys?

32:46.098 --> 32:49.466
I mean, we're hostages.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.168
Can there still be hostages?

32:51.170 --> 32:53.737
Can I look over how completely
fucked this situation is

32:53.739 --> 32:55.405
and ask why I don't get
a say in the matter?

32:55.407 --> 32:57.574
Listen, we're all fucking
accomplices here, okay?

32:57.576 --> 33:00.644
So get a fucking mop
and help clean this shit up.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.980
Thank you. Look at who's all
coming together as a team.

33:04.717 --> 33:08.051
It's my phone. Nobody fucking
shoot anybody in the face.

33:09.587 --> 33:12.322
Hey, Hillary had the baby.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.224
Everyone, he's an uncle.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.093
I'm an uncle!
I'm an uncle!

33:16.095 --> 33:17.494
Congrats, man.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.730
Thanks, buddy.
That's really sweet.

33:19.732 --> 33:21.498
Look at his little cheeks.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.633
Are you guys coming back?

33:23.635 --> 33:26.036
Does this mean I have
to get her a present?

33:29.474 --> 33:32.743
Are we not having the same day?

33:32.745 --> 33:36.079
Yeah, but we could be
the sandwich guy.

33:36.081 --> 33:38.382
Of course, you do realize
that if we don't die here today

33:38.384 --> 33:40.017
we're going to be
accessories to murder

33:40.019 --> 33:43.153
because clearly,
the cops are in on it.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.756
- And do you want to know why?
- Why?

33:45.758 --> 33:49.760
Because my fucktard brother thinks he's
the Richard Branson of fruit cobbler.

33:49.762 --> 33:52.729
Who the fuck is Richard Branson?

33:52.731 --> 33:56.133
Wow. How are we related?

33:56.135 --> 33:59.269
This day's actually
shaping up quite nicely.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.704
I just saved 15 grand.

34:28.498 --> 34:33.270
Hey. You okay?

34:33.272 --> 34:34.538
I'm amazing, clearly.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.284
Anything I can do to help?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.786
Certainly hope so. I mean
this is clearly your fault.

34:49.788 --> 34:54.658
No, it's not.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.159
Yeah, well...

35:01.232 --> 35:02.632
I'm sorry.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.234
You know, there's just
a few things in life

35:04.236 --> 35:06.103
that a simple "I'm sorry"
doesn't cut it for

35:06.105 --> 35:07.604
and I think that this might
be one of them.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.207
And why not?
I didn't shoot him.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.709
Let me think about that one.
"Um, excuse me, sir,

35:12.711 --> 35:17.581
where are your 'I'm sorry for blowing the
Paki-fucking-Stani's head off' greeting cards,

35:17.583 --> 35:20.517
because you know,
I browsed your entire aisle

35:20.519 --> 35:22.385
but I just can't seem
to find the one

35:22.387 --> 35:24.621
that portrays
this particular emotion."

35:24.623 --> 35:28.792
Hey, hey. What's the problem
over here?

35:28.794 --> 35:29.826
The problem?

35:29.828 --> 35:33.563
What's the problem?

35:33.565 --> 35:39.603
I am literally sitting
in a puddle of thoughts.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.344
What's wrong?

35:48.613 --> 35:50.247
We need a theme song.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.349
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same damn thing.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.217
We are like totally
on the same page.

35:54.219 --> 35:56.253
I was worried, you know,
this is great.

35:56.255 --> 35:59.789
Yeah, agreed. So something
with a driving rock beat.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.826
Like nirvana or zeppelin.

36:02.828 --> 36:06.263
Ew. I was thinking something
a little more contemporary,

36:06.265 --> 36:09.166
you know, like billboard top 40.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.268
- Top 40?
- Yeah.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.704
You can't go bust up a shoot out with
Adele crying about her boyfriend.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.573
- Hey!
- Whoa!

36:16.575 --> 36:21.811
Sorry, but hey don't you dare
ever talk about her like that.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.948
She is beautiful
and volumptuous.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.850
Very volumptuous and talented.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.452
Just saying that she's not who
I would want accompanying me

36:29.454 --> 36:31.721
when I'm going balls out
in a room full of criminals.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.791
- No, first of all, you said her.
- I didn't say...

36:34.793 --> 36:36.393
I didn't even say Adele.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.495
- And second first of all...
- Second of all.

36:38.497 --> 36:42.632
Second first of all, what is
your problem with pop music?

36:42.634 --> 36:43.900
First of all,
it's "second of all,"

36:43.902 --> 36:46.503
and second of all
I don't have one.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.637
Whatever!

36:50.374 --> 36:52.375
Give me my gun.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.477
Give it to me.
It's my gun, buddy.

36:54.479 --> 36:55.579
Well, whatever.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.782
You left yours in the bar.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.518
Whoa, hey, hey folks.
Hey, hey, hey.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.853
The area's actually been
shut down for a while.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.622
- Whoa.
- Aah!

37:05.624 --> 37:06.823
Whoa, whoa!

37:06.825 --> 37:08.625
- Give me your gun.
- No.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.493
We thought we heard
gunshots or something.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.562
How do you guys know
what gunshots sound like?

37:12.564 --> 37:15.865
And, uh, easy e over here been
playing laser tag with Mac ten?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.367
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

37:17.369 --> 37:18.568
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

37:18.570 --> 37:20.470
- Don't "whoa" me.
- Whoa.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.439
There's no need
to be aggressive.

37:22.441 --> 37:26.276
- Why don't you show me...
- Whoa!

37:26.278 --> 37:29.512
No need for that, okay?
He's just saying.

37:29.514 --> 37:33.750
Yeah, I'm just saying, this
place is closed down is all.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.553
And we're just trying
to keep a safe perimeter

37:36.555 --> 37:40.023
for the safety
of folks like you.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.592
Uh, renovations.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.993
You know, power drills,
wrenches, stuff like that.

37:45.018 --> 37:46.263
That's what you heard.

37:46.265 --> 37:47.397
Why, what are they building?

37:47.399 --> 37:50.634
Uhh, the bar.
The bar things.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.270
- I like bar things. -I didn't
even know this place existed.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.538
As far as I'm concerned,
it still doesn't.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.773
It's disgusting.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.876
L.A.'s best kept secret.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.778
Shh!

38:01.780 --> 38:03.480
Cool.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.915
- I'm gonna tweet that.
- Tweet the shit out of that.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.017
Can we take a selfie?

38:07.019 --> 38:08.451
Tweet the shit out of that.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.733
My life's ruined, you know that?

38:29.473 --> 38:31.007
That's a pretty broad statement.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.742
I was hiding away
from this world

38:32.744 --> 38:34.644
never to be found like a...

38:38.416 --> 38:39.916
Like a relic or...

38:43.454 --> 38:46.690
A nobody.

38:46.692 --> 38:52.495
But now thanks to you,
I'm a murderer.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.431
There's no hiding anymore.

38:56.534 --> 38:58.568
I'm exposed.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.970
Maybe you are,

39:00.972 --> 39:03.973
but you are not nobody.

39:03.975 --> 39:06.076
You never were.

39:06.078 --> 39:09.412
You're just not who you planned
on being at the start.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.622
You're a lunatic.
I get it.

39:19.624 --> 39:22.859
So, shit, maybe I am.

39:25.696 --> 39:29.466
I think there's a little
bit of lunatic,

39:29.468 --> 39:32.035
little bit of
sociopath in all of us.

39:34.004 --> 39:38.675
The difference is that I'm fixing
to accept it as part of me,

39:38.677 --> 39:42.011
and now it's your turn
to join the cause.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.847
Want to become a murderer?

39:45.983 --> 39:49.753
Why would anyone in their right
minds want to do that?

39:49.755 --> 39:52.922
Okay, I put most of
the nasty pieces in a bag.

39:52.924 --> 39:55.592
The floor...
The floor's pretty clean.

39:55.594 --> 40:00.430
I hate to be
a Debbie downer, guys,

40:00.432 --> 40:02.832
but it looks like
you missed a spot.

40:02.834 --> 40:07.036
Yeah, well we didn't figure
that part out.

40:07.038 --> 40:11.007
But in all fairness, you did
get most of the face bits up

40:11.009 --> 40:14.110
and the chicken sandwich
is gone, so...

40:14.112 --> 40:15.979
Great.

40:15.981 --> 40:18.948
Great. Yeah.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.885
Well, what are you gonna do with
the rest of the fucking body?

40:21.887 --> 40:23.520
Why are you asking me?

40:23.522 --> 40:25.488
Because you're the cockface
that brought a gun

40:25.490 --> 40:26.956
into my fucking bar.

40:26.958 --> 40:30.860
First of all, I am not
a cockface, you cockface.

40:30.862 --> 40:34.431
Okay, enough. Why don't we
take the headless body,

40:34.433 --> 40:36.199
put it in the plastic bag,

40:36.201 --> 40:37.921
and then we'll just throw
him in your trunk.

40:42.740 --> 40:45.108
That's precious.

40:45.110 --> 40:49.712
There's no fucking way
that thing is going in my trunk.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.681
Why don't we put him
in Grady's trunk?

40:54.051 --> 40:55.452
Who the fuck is Grady?

40:55.454 --> 40:56.820
Grady's the fucking owner.

40:56.822 --> 40:58.788
You didn't think this
was his place, did you?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.657
Well yeah,
as a matter of fact, I did.

41:00.659 --> 41:04.627
Please.
He just works here.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.663
Excuse me?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.665
I don't just fucking work here,

41:08.667 --> 41:10.500
I'm a staple of
this establishment.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.236
I've been here for 20 years,

41:13.238 --> 41:16.639
you, young lady, just work here.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.708
Why don't you go piss
on all the fucking tables

41:18.710 --> 41:20.176
and show us which ones
are yours.

41:20.178 --> 41:23.179
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

41:23.181 --> 41:25.682
Do you know how many hot tits
I see bounce through that door?

41:25.684 --> 41:28.184
I've outlasted every single one
of you, sweetheart,

41:28.186 --> 41:29.919
you came with
an expiration date.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.855
Like I give a shit.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.958
This is just supposed
to be a stopover for me,

41:34.960 --> 41:37.594
whereas this is your whole
fucking life and I'm sorry,

41:37.596 --> 41:39.796
but you came with
an expiration date

41:39.798 --> 41:42.832
and the milk's gone bad and, you
know what, Grady can go fuck himself

41:42.834 --> 41:44.734
and so can you, for that matter.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.704
Hold on a second, is this
Grady fella, is he here?

41:47.706 --> 41:49.873
No, his car's been out back
for the last five days.

41:53.277 --> 41:55.144
I am not touching that.

41:55.146 --> 41:58.214
That is your fucking
problem, my man.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.750
Grady keeps a spare
set of keys in the basement.

42:00.752 --> 42:03.820
I am gonna go find them.

42:04.755 --> 42:05.855
Good luck.

42:11.095 --> 42:13.563
And he took me to Jack in
the box for my 22nd birthday.

42:13.565 --> 42:16.299
- You love Jack in the box.
- Yeah, lots of people love it.

42:16.301 --> 42:19.102
Doesn't mean they take their girlfriends
there for their 22nd birthday.

42:19.104 --> 42:22.071
Then why didn't you tell me? I would've taken
you to, like, a taco truck or something.

42:22.073 --> 42:24.607
You don't take your girl
for fucking street meat.

42:24.609 --> 42:26.309
How are you wired so wrongly
you're not getting this?

42:26.311 --> 42:28.678
He's not listening to you.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.747
See, this is
his "tuning you out" face.

42:30.749 --> 42:33.983
How does that look any different
than how he normally fucking looks?

42:33.985 --> 42:36.653
I blame our mother.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.655
What?
You didn't like her, too?

42:38.657 --> 42:41.925
No, she was great.
She loved us to death.

42:41.927 --> 42:44.193
So what is the problem?

42:44.195 --> 42:45.595
That is the problem.

42:45.597 --> 42:48.264
She loved us
too unconditionally.

42:48.266 --> 42:50.600
It stunted his growth.

42:50.602 --> 42:53.670
For instance, one time, when I
was 16 for her 45th birthday

42:53.672 --> 42:56.306
I wanted to buy her a purse,
a nice purse, so I got a job

42:56.308 --> 43:00.743
- because I wanted to buy her a coach purse.
- I like coach.

43:00.745 --> 43:05.214
Yeah, well, Pablo Picasso, over here,
decides he's gonna finger paint a picture

43:05.216 --> 43:08.885
of our fat fuck
next door neighbor, Chuck.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.721
Well, what, is he super important
to you guys or something?

43:11.723 --> 43:15.858
No, he was a fat fucking idiot
who lived next door

43:15.860 --> 43:18.328
who ate paste
and he had this fucking dog

43:18.330 --> 43:23.733
that would take these heaping
piles of shit on our grass.

43:23.735 --> 43:27.236
What fucking kind of 16 year old kid
says "hi mom, thanks for being my mom"

43:27.238 --> 43:32.041
by finger painting a picture
of a fat fucking idiot?

43:32.043 --> 43:35.144
What, was there no macaroni
around to make her a necklace?

43:35.146 --> 43:37.647
She loved that painting.

43:37.649 --> 43:39.315
Didn't she?

43:39.317 --> 43:42.719
Yes, Brian.
She did love the painting,

43:42.721 --> 43:44.287
and that's the problem.

43:44.289 --> 43:46.222
She loved you
too unconditionally

43:46.224 --> 43:47.657
and you never became a man.

43:59.203 --> 44:03.640
Guys, we need some help out
there with the...

44:03.642 --> 44:05.875
Me, me, me.
I volunteer.

44:05.877 --> 44:08.978
- Really? -Yes, yes, just get
me away from these guys

44:08.980 --> 44:11.681
and don't shoot me
or fuck with me or anything

44:11.683 --> 44:14.117
and I'll do anything you want.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.019
All right.

44:16.021 --> 44:19.022
All right, let's go.

44:20.958 --> 44:24.961
Hey bud, I'd like
to volunteer, too.

44:24.963 --> 44:27.764
I got some money
I could give you.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.132
Really?

44:29.134 --> 44:30.433
Wanna hold that for me?

44:35.773 --> 44:38.675
What good is that money
gonna do?

44:38.677 --> 44:41.377
Seriously?

44:41.379 --> 44:43.279
All the kings horses,
all the kings men,

44:43.281 --> 44:45.281
couldn't reattach
sandwich man's face again.

44:53.257 --> 44:55.158
Here.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.093
- Take this.
- What are you doing?

44:57.095 --> 45:01.230
Take this.

45:01.232 --> 45:03.299
This is you now.

45:03.301 --> 45:05.334
It's Charley hart exposed.

45:07.838 --> 45:08.971
Okay.

45:18.015 --> 45:22.452
Okay, so lesson one, never
let yourself get distracted.

45:24.755 --> 45:27.890
It's the difference
between being the hunter

45:27.892 --> 45:29.292
and being the hunted.

45:33.864 --> 45:36.833
You're doing...
You're doing things to me.

45:36.835 --> 45:37.967
Oh, am I?

45:43.006 --> 45:45.908
Yeah, you're doing that.

45:45.910 --> 45:48.344
That's the problem
I find with all men.

45:48.346 --> 45:50.480
Oh, what's that?

45:50.482 --> 45:52.815
They're always thinking
with the wrong head.

45:52.817 --> 45:54.751
Are you nuts? This thing
could have went off.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.353
Oh, there's no bullets in it.

45:57.355 --> 46:00.056
I don't have a death wish,
trust me, sugar.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.431
You got this?

46:16.774 --> 46:19.542
Like this?

46:19.544 --> 46:21.277
Yeah, something like that.

46:23.013 --> 46:24.881
Well, how do I look?

46:26.483 --> 46:27.950
Here.

46:31.889 --> 46:33.022
Like you.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.363
- Hey, go to Facebook and
like my status. -Later.

46:40.365 --> 46:43.466
No, come on!
Do it now.

46:43.468 --> 46:44.867
Why do I have to do it now?

46:44.869 --> 46:46.836
Because nobody likes anything,

46:46.838 --> 46:49.105
until the first person
shows up and does it.

46:52.544 --> 46:53.910
Fine, god.

46:57.414 --> 47:00.149
"Staking out a potential
crime scene."

47:00.151 --> 47:04.987
Oh wait, wait, I just got
another notification.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.489
You tagged me in your status?

47:06.491 --> 47:08.357
- Did you like it?
- I don't wanna like it.

47:08.359 --> 47:11.460
Why are you being such a bitch?
Just like my fucking status.

47:11.462 --> 47:12.929
Because.

47:18.969 --> 47:21.504
I'm getting a little concerned
with all the people showing up.

47:27.578 --> 47:30.580
They're like hipster zombies.

47:32.449 --> 47:35.051
Don't acknowledge them
and they'll go away.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.355
Zombies just don't go away
if you ignore them, Petey.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.524
Sure they do.

47:41.526 --> 47:43.993
That's a t-Rex because
of their poor sight.

47:43.995 --> 47:47.129
Haven't you ever seen
"Jurassic park"? Come on.

47:47.131 --> 47:49.232
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'm sorry.

47:49.234 --> 47:51.200
- Shit, my analogy doesn't work then.
- Well no, it doesn't.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.201
What do you want to do?

47:52.203 --> 47:55.137
Do you have hipster t-rexs?

47:55.139 --> 47:56.138
I don't know.

47:56.140 --> 47:59.075
God, they're multiplying.

47:59.077 --> 48:01.577
We should do something.

48:01.579 --> 48:03.980
Well, what are we gonna do?

48:03.982 --> 48:07.216
Huh?

48:07.218 --> 48:09.085
What are you doing?

48:09.087 --> 48:10.620
I'm communicating.

48:10.622 --> 48:12.622
What?
Should I do it, too?

48:12.624 --> 48:15.024
I don't know.

48:15.026 --> 48:17.126
Oh, come on.
What now?

48:17.128 --> 48:19.428
More blood just came out
of his head hole thing, man.

48:19.430 --> 48:22.164
My god, fuck, I'll get some
paper towels. God damn it.

48:22.166 --> 48:24.166
- Aw, shit, man.
- We ain't got that far to go.

48:24.168 --> 48:25.902
Dude, I'm gonna
straight up vomit, yo.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.137
Like, dude, I'm like
a vegan sometimes

48:28.139 --> 48:31.140
and this man meat is fucking
gettin' in my head, dude.

48:31.142 --> 48:32.909
Shit.

48:36.013 --> 48:40.316
Hey man, can I ask
you a question?

48:40.318 --> 48:42.351
Will it make a difference
if I say no?

48:42.353 --> 48:44.620
Why do you do stuff
like this, man?

48:44.622 --> 48:48.124
I mean, I'm not an idiot, I get that,
like, people need to make money and stuff

48:48.126 --> 48:52.295
but it's, just, like, you don't
really seem like that type of guy.

48:52.297 --> 48:53.930
What type of guy is that?

48:53.932 --> 48:55.998
The type of guy that gets
in a fight with his girl

48:56.000 --> 48:59.468
just right in front of everyone
and just kind of sorta takes it?

48:59.470 --> 49:01.003
You don't even know
the half of it.

49:01.005 --> 49:02.471
No, dude, I know all of it, man.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.340
You know that girl, Nikki,
in there?

49:04.342 --> 49:08.044
She's always on my case about
like fucking making money

49:08.046 --> 49:10.212
or, like, getting a job,
or growing up.

49:10.214 --> 49:13.049
Oh, my god,
it never ends with Reni.

49:13.051 --> 49:14.951
Nothing I ever do is
ever good enough for her

49:14.953 --> 49:16.953
or even worse, it's a doorway
to another argument.

49:16.955 --> 49:20.656
Oh man, dude, you don't need
that sort of stress, man.

49:20.658 --> 49:23.092
You are like, a really nice guy.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.627
I am a really nice guy.

49:24.629 --> 49:28.431
Yeah, a real "take home to mom"
kind of guy.

49:28.433 --> 49:29.732
I work three jobs.

49:29.734 --> 49:31.367
Oh yeah?
Is this one of them?

49:31.369 --> 49:33.202
And I go to night school.

49:33.204 --> 49:34.537
Whoop-de-fucking-do.

49:34.539 --> 49:36.405
Dude, do not let her get you
down, all right?

49:36.407 --> 49:40.509
What you gotta do is you
just gotta relax, okay?

49:40.511 --> 49:43.079
You gotta freaking quit your job

49:43.081 --> 49:46.482
or whatever you're doing
and just watch a sunrise

49:46.484 --> 49:51.187
or, like, catch up
on some reruns, you know?

49:51.189 --> 49:54.323
I can't fucking quit.
That's crazy.

49:54.325 --> 49:57.259
What's crazy is you working
like a dog for some chick

49:57.261 --> 49:58.561
that doesn't even respect you

49:58.563 --> 50:01.030
and makes you fucking
rob dive bars.

50:01.032 --> 50:02.999
That's what's up.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.133
I don't do it for her.

50:09.406 --> 50:11.674
I guess I do it for me.

50:15.112 --> 50:16.345
That's dark, man.

50:16.347 --> 50:19.181
You're a straight up
masochist, bro.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.516
Hardly.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.586
- Come on.
- All right.

50:23.588 --> 50:25.554
One, two, three, lift.

50:25.556 --> 50:27.456
See, part of life is doing
something with it.

50:27.458 --> 50:30.359
No, dude, that's
that same propaganda shit.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.328
You sound like my brother,
you gotta get

50:32.330 --> 50:35.264
that corporate wired bullshit
out of your head, man.

50:35.266 --> 50:37.400
They programmed you
to say that, dude.

50:37.402 --> 50:39.535
You know if you're gonna talk
to me about sunrises

50:39.537 --> 50:42.371
and positive vibes you gotta know
how to balance the equation first.

50:42.373 --> 50:45.207
What do you mean by that?

50:45.209 --> 50:46.776
How can you just take
everything in

50:46.778 --> 50:49.078
without giving anything back?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.246
Makes you wanna
do something you love.

50:50.248 --> 50:52.548
Something you're
passionate about.

50:52.550 --> 50:56.085
You know, things that add up to the
universal flow that you're going on about.

50:56.087 --> 50:57.486
Things that would
inspire others to go

50:57.488 --> 50:59.455
and do great things
of their own.

50:59.457 --> 51:03.259
Otherwise, what's
the purpose of living?

51:04.728 --> 51:09.765
That's like Monet
really appreciating art.

51:09.767 --> 51:12.501
But never painting
anything himself,

51:12.503 --> 51:18.107
just sit on his fucking ass
in the champs-élysées all day.

51:18.109 --> 51:20.843
Now, I know it's
an extreme example,

51:20.845 --> 51:22.325
but what a waste
that would have been.

51:28.552 --> 51:33.189
- Everyone's life, it means something.
- Fuck.

51:33.191 --> 51:36.492
If you fucking drop it again,
you can fucking clean it.

51:36.494 --> 51:39.228
My bad, dude, it's just he's
blowing my mind over here.

51:39.230 --> 51:41.197
And his mind's all ready been
blown, so I don't even know.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.165
It's all right.

51:43.167 --> 51:45.101
Why don't you run off
and go grab vin, okay?

51:45.103 --> 51:46.836
- Yeah, I can do that.
- You clean this up.

51:46.838 --> 51:48.270
You're not gonna
fucking help me?

51:48.272 --> 51:49.805
Ain't my cup of tea, darlin'.

51:51.475 --> 51:53.676
Moskowitz.

51:57.180 --> 51:58.280
Hey, man.

52:10.393 --> 52:11.694
Nikki.

52:16.466 --> 52:17.900
Nikki.

52:17.902 --> 52:19.201
What?

52:23.707 --> 52:28.377
Listen, I, um...

52:28.379 --> 52:29.778
I want to apologize.

52:31.414 --> 52:32.414
For what?

52:32.416 --> 52:36.318
This isn't your fault.

52:36.320 --> 52:41.457
Um, earlier when I said
you were a bad person.

52:41.459 --> 52:45.494
I'm sorry, okay?

52:45.496 --> 52:49.798
You seem all right, I guess.

52:49.800 --> 52:53.736
Well, maybe i...
Maybe I misjudged you.

52:53.738 --> 52:57.506
You know he talks about
you all the time.

52:57.508 --> 53:02.411
Most of the time it comes off
like he's complaining,

53:02.413 --> 53:04.180
but it's love
if there ever was any.

53:06.583 --> 53:10.252
- He looks up to you.

53:10.254 --> 53:12.388
I find that hard to believe.

53:12.390 --> 53:17.826
Seeing you was probably the only reason
he ever agreed to this whole thing

53:17.828 --> 53:21.864
and yes, for the record,
it was my idea.

53:24.634 --> 53:26.569
He loves you

53:26.571 --> 53:29.772
because he doesn't
have to be you.

53:29.774 --> 53:34.710
Martin, Martin Sullivan,

53:34.712 --> 53:39.415
real estate developer,
MBA Stanford 2006,

53:39.417 --> 53:42.718
b.S. In economics,

salutatorian George r. Wallace
high school class of '97,

53:46.657 --> 53:49.325
football team, debate club.

53:49.327 --> 53:52.228
How the fuck do you know that?

53:52.230 --> 53:54.964
You could smell it on me, right?

53:54.966 --> 53:58.367
My sickness?

53:58.369 --> 54:00.936
Problem is...

54:02.572 --> 54:03.572
I want more.

54:07.444 --> 54:09.478
Just like you.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.748
Two roads, one parallel path.

54:18.455 --> 54:22.625
Because let's be real,
Brian's the man I'm with,

54:26.796 --> 54:28.497
but you're the one I want.

54:28.499 --> 54:29.999
What the fuck are you doing?

54:33.303 --> 54:34.703
You were right about him.

54:37.607 --> 54:39.308
He never learned
how to be a man.

54:47.984 --> 54:48.984
What are you doing, vin?

54:48.986 --> 54:51.754
Sorry, kids, show's over.

54:54.491 --> 54:56.659
I wouldn't do that,
if I was you.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.926
You know, I didn't mean anything
by what I said earlier.

54:57.928 --> 55:00.562
I put my fucking soul
into this place

55:00.564 --> 55:03.332
and what do I have
to show for it?

55:03.334 --> 55:06.769
A spot in the queue behind every fake-titted
hottie looking for work in this town.

55:06.771 --> 55:10.306
Excuse me, but my boobs
are real.

55:10.308 --> 55:12.574
Just let us go, vin.

55:12.576 --> 55:17.313
Your lady, she was on to something.
She's a smart one.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.048
Wrong place...

55:19.050 --> 55:20.716
Wrong time.

55:20.718 --> 55:22.651
What are you doing, Charley?

55:22.653 --> 55:25.421
I could ask you the same thing.

55:25.423 --> 55:28.824
Look, haven't you done enough
damage for one day?

55:28.826 --> 55:30.993
Put the fucking gun down.

55:30.995 --> 55:32.027
Not this time.

55:32.029 --> 55:33.896
Not last time either.

55:33.898 --> 55:35.931
Look how well that worked out.

55:35.933 --> 55:38.434
Don't you understand?

55:38.436 --> 55:40.502
Grady lied to me, man.
He fucked me.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.604
Oh, you're not the only
one with problems.

55:42.606 --> 55:44.973
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Oh right, yeah,

55:44.975 --> 55:46.608
because it was my idea
to close this place down.

55:46.610 --> 55:48.377
What else is my problem?

55:48.379 --> 55:51.747
Oh, my fucking god, it never
fucking ends with you!

55:51.749 --> 55:54.783
Jesus Christ, you two,
we're not doing this again.

55:54.785 --> 55:57.052
You know, I know a professional
who would really help you

55:57.054 --> 55:58.620
get in touch
with your core values.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.522
What the fuck?

56:00.524 --> 56:02.424
Are you working
for this woman now?

56:02.426 --> 56:04.560
I might as well,
she has a real job.

56:04.562 --> 56:06.428
Did you know, that in America,

56:06.430 --> 56:07.796
dreams aren't tendered currency?

56:07.798 --> 56:10.532
Yeah, and how you payin'
the new bitch over here?

56:10.534 --> 56:12.134
Designer cupcakes?

56:15.405 --> 56:18.974
Go ahead, shoot me in the back,
won't be the first time.

56:18.976 --> 56:20.609
Wow, look at you all noble.

56:20.611 --> 56:22.711
Look, Grady has
the fucking money.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.480
I don't know where it is,

56:24.482 --> 56:26.582
but I've been trying to get
it out of him for a week.

56:26.584 --> 56:27.950
Wait, so what are you hiding?

56:27.952 --> 56:31.487
All right, I got him tied up.

56:31.489 --> 56:34.757
- Who, Grady?
- -Yeah.

56:34.759 --> 56:37.993
I've done everything north
of killing the old bastard,

56:37.995 --> 56:39.561
been beating on him for a week.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.397
Could've sworn that you
were just masturbating.

56:41.399 --> 56:43.966
I wasn't fucking masturbating.
Who fucking does that at work?

56:45.970 --> 56:46.969
Slap my ass.

56:46.971 --> 56:48.504
I can't.

56:52.642 --> 56:53.942
So when do I start?

56:53.944 --> 56:55.611
Start what?

56:55.613 --> 56:58.046
- My job at your office.
- You don't even know what I do.

56:58.048 --> 57:01.083
Whatever, land development, property
management, whatever you do.

57:06.189 --> 57:07.856
Don't make me tell
Brian about this.

57:07.858 --> 57:09.425
You're one insidious bitch.

57:11.161 --> 57:13.962
You know me and you like it.

57:15.865 --> 57:17.433
I mean, it's all a moot point

57:17.435 --> 57:18.734
if we don't get anything
out of him.

57:18.736 --> 57:20.436
Am I right?

57:20.438 --> 57:23.539
What are you saying?

57:23.541 --> 57:24.740
Let's go meet this guy, then.

57:25.775 --> 57:26.775
- Aah!
- Ooh!

57:30.047 --> 57:32.014
Why'd the hell
you do that, Charley?

57:32.016 --> 57:34.783
She told me there wasn't any bullets in it!
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.118
I was trying to give
you confidence.

57:36.120 --> 57:38.153
How the hell am I supposed
to know that?

57:40.690 --> 57:42.191
You're gonna point that at me?

57:45.595 --> 57:47.696
What?

57:49.500 --> 57:53.135
I'm just... I'm just gonna
see who's at the door, okay?

57:53.137 --> 57:54.703
Don't you fucking leave.

58:01.177 --> 58:04.713
What the fuck is going on here?

58:04.715 --> 58:08.617
What? Wow, really?

58:08.619 --> 58:11.887
Every time we come in here.

58:11.889 --> 58:14.690
What's wrong with you people?

58:14.692 --> 58:15.757
Let's go meet the fucking guy.

58:15.759 --> 58:17.593
Come on.

58:19.896 --> 58:21.630
Now that was a gunshot.

58:21.632 --> 58:22.931
I dislike violence.

58:22.933 --> 58:25.667
I was a vegan for a while,
at Vassar.

58:25.669 --> 58:28.904
Yeah, man, I'm a vegan too.

58:28.906 --> 58:30.706
Yeah, we're all kind of vegan.

58:30.708 --> 58:32.574
Are they filming
something in there?

58:34.577 --> 58:37.813
Fuckin' right they're shooting
something in there.

58:37.815 --> 58:43.852
So, you guys aren't cops,
you're like actual actors.

58:45.288 --> 58:46.288
Yes.

58:46.290 --> 58:47.956
That's hot.

58:47.958 --> 58:49.925
Thanks.

58:49.927 --> 58:53.262
So Coachella this year wasn't
as good as it normally is,

58:53.264 --> 58:56.832
but burning man is really
chill this year.

58:56.834 --> 58:59.034
Have you ever been
to any concerts?

58:59.036 --> 59:01.136
Like, you probably saw,
like, Elvis

59:01.138 --> 59:03.205
or something or Mozart?
How old are you?

59:03.207 --> 59:05.574
Oh, you probably went
to Woodstock probably,

59:05.576 --> 59:08.544
because... or did they even have
music when you were young?

59:08.546 --> 59:10.145
- Oh.
- -Oh, hey guys.

59:10.147 --> 59:13.015
The fairy fucking
godmother returns.

59:13.017 --> 59:14.883
Well, what have we here?

59:14.885 --> 59:19.721
And they said the spice girls
would never get back together.

59:19.723 --> 59:25.594
Been stuck down here with...
Used tampon spice.

59:25.596 --> 59:29.831
We got fairy dragon spice,
hood rat spice.

59:31.634 --> 59:35.737
They found him, they said he
couldn't... they found Waldo.

59:36.673 --> 59:38.907
Waldo spice.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.309
Fucking band's back together.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.945
This is our big break.

59:42.947 --> 59:44.880
Are you serious?

59:44.882 --> 59:47.049
What do you see out there?

59:47.051 --> 59:49.685
Well, Pete, I see
a lot of witnesses.

59:49.687 --> 59:53.188
Really? I see
our first audience.

59:53.190 --> 59:54.990
I mean, look at them all.

59:54.992 --> 59:57.593
10 years from now,
they're gonna say,

59:57.595 --> 01:00:01.330
"shit man,
hey, I was there."

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.003
Uh, Pete, there for what?

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:11.773
We go inside, we clean up the
mess, we come out heroes

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:17.012
and all anyone remembers, through
these guys, is us doing our thing.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:22.184
We're gonna miss
don's improv class, Pete.

01:00:22.186 --> 01:00:25.687
Fuck don, think Scorsese.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:28.790
We're gonna be huge.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:29.791
Huge!

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:30.792
You really mean that?

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:31.893
Yes.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.329
- Like action stars?
- Yes.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.832
What's our first move?

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:40.802
- We gotta gear up.
- Why?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.038
Because you dropped your gun
the second you walked in there.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.640
Wait a second, I got scared.

01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:46.041
- I got really scared.
- I'm not blaming you.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:48.043
But try to stay
in character next time.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.981
Well, we can't go back
to the station.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.417
Where are we gonna
get you a gun, then?

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.189
My mom.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:02.791
My mom!

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:03.925
Are you fucking nuts?

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:05.761
No, my mom.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:09.665
Dude, she can take out, like,
a small developing country.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:14.036
You know, like, um, like Asia!

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.103
Or something, right?

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:17.172
- Right?
- Right. Small.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.708
You know what, ask me.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:22.978
Ask me what else I have there, man.
Just ask me.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:23.979
Come on, let me hear it.

01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:26.248
What else do you have there?

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:30.018
My gopro.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.953
My gopro is there!

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:33.155
Holy shit.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:34.723
Oh, my god.

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:36.124
We film the whole thing.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:39.227
Oh, my god.
The greatest demo reel ever.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.899
I love where your head's
at right now.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:47.402
Oh, my god!
Yeah!

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:51.006
Hold on a second. Yo, hey,
anyone wanna be a P.A.?

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:52.274
Me, me. Pick me.

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:53.375
- Anyone?
- What are you doing?

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:57.446
- You're crewing up now.
- Okay.

01:01:57.448 --> 01:02:01.283
Anyone? Hey yeah, uh,
you with the orange scarf.

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:03.418
Yeah, you, buddy, come on.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.821
- Orange is my favorite color,
so that's good. -That's good.

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:08.757
That's why I picked it.
I was thinking of you. Always.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:11.293
- Uh, oh, hey man.
- Uh, hey man.

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:14.296
Hey, we're gonna have to pull
our awesome car around

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:15.864
in a bit and make an entrance

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:18.867
I need you on crowd control.

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:20.869
- Control the crowd.
- Your people.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.940
What's in it for me?

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:29.945
$50.

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:34.449
I made $400 as a stand-in in a
Cialis commercial last month.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:40.055
I need five, and
the potential for a walk-on.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.927
- Speaking part?
- Don't push it.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:48.163
Don't push it.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:50.999
Fine.
What do I do?

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:55.170
Um, I need you to get the crowd
pumped up, like totally amped.

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:57.072
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:57.074 --> 01:03:00.509
And, take this.

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:02.544
One second.
You're sure you've got more?

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:03.879
You're sure your mom has more?

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:06.047
One second.
Of course.

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:08.984
- You promise?
- Yes, of course.

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:13.522
All right.
Keep them in line.

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:18.260
Welcome to the production
team, skittles.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:22.531
Can I call you "skittles"?

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.199
It's a Beretta nine mil.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.435
The name's Trevor.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:30.505
- Trevor.
- Okay, skittles.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:34.442
Vinny, how many years
has it been, huh?

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:38.280
How many years
have I overpaid your fat ass

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:41.449
to do the job
of a fucking autistic monkey?

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:47.022
I mean we only serve two drinks,
for Christ's sake, light or dark.

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:50.425
It ain't like you're working at the chateau
Marmont and you have to know French.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:52.060
You don't even have
to know English!

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:53.895
For Christ's sake!

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:57.933
You could decide your order
with a fucking flip of a coin.

01:03:57.935 --> 01:04:00.268
So what it's been?

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.571
10 years?

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:04.840
20?

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.208
And this is how you repay me.

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:09.544
You weren't so mouthy
before, Grady.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:12.147
You were begging me
to let you go like a bitch.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:15.417
Well, you'd certainly know
about that, wouldn't you?

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:17.052
Coming in here all bowlegged,

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:19.988
looking like David Crosby
after a colonoscopy.

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:31.032
Too bad you let tampon spice go,
we could use him.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.436
You don't have any idea

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:37.105
of what I'm
talking about, do you?

01:04:37.107 --> 01:04:41.977
It's over your head.
The vagina and its mysteries

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:47.649
are just an enigmatic nuance
to you, aren't they?

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:50.151
I'm gay.

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:51.586
I've been in a committed
relationship

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:53.588
for as long as I've been
working for this shitbag.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:58.193
Oh right, right, your big
black boyfriend, precious.

01:04:58.195 --> 01:05:00.328
His name is Douglas.

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:03.130
And if he heard the way you were
speaking about him he'd eat you alive.

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:07.636
Of course he'd eat me.
That's what he does!

01:05:07.638 --> 01:05:09.237
He's a cock gobbler!

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:10.472
He's actually an incredible man.

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:12.941
Yeah, you get my vote
for prom queen.

01:05:12.943 --> 01:05:15.310
Seriously, stop, stop.

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:17.679
He's just trying
to get you riled up, okay?

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:20.148
So let's just cut the shit
and get down to business.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:23.652
See, I like her.
Straight to the point.

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:27.622
Okay, you're sitting on a lot
of cash, and we need it.

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:32.494
Oh, for fuck's sake, like I've been
trying to tell mother Hubbard here,

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:36.431
there ain't no money.
This is it.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.433
I've been working here
for 20 years.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:39.668
I do your books, Grady.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.003
There ain't any fucking money!

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:45.407
So go ahead and keep
tickling me, you big Mary.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:49.978
It ain't gonna change nothing.
It ain't gonna do any good.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.114
I wish you had the nerve
you think you have.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.716
You were a good kid.

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.184
You're a sweet kid.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:59.421
You're a good man.

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:03.692
You don't have the nuts
to finish this.

01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:06.428
No, but he does.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:12.267
The most dangerous man
I have ever seen with a gun.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.336
He is a flat-out
cold-blooded killer.

01:06:14.338 --> 01:06:18.373
I've taken shits
that are scarier than him.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:19.674
And bloodier.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:23.044
I'm just tremblin'
in my fucking boots.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.379
Then you haven't seen him work.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:30.986
Oh, sh...
Christ, that really stings.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:33.521
I'm just trying to clean it,
so I can see.

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.323
And then what?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.559
I don't know.
I'm not the one with the gun.

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.094
I was kind of hoping
you'd know what to do?

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:40.762
I've actually never
been shot before.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:42.564
Rick is a man of peace.

01:06:42.566 --> 01:06:44.332
Oh yeah, you know this how?

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:48.403
We had this whole moment before
and, like, got to know him

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:50.638
and got really good vibes
off this guy.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.776
Oh, yeah? Criminals with good vibes.
Real nice.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:57.412
Just to be clear,
I am not a criminal.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:07:01.016
That's right,
you are the man of many jobs.

01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:04.386
I was studying
to be an architect.

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:07.288
And then I moved out here
because of Reni.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:10.325
So night school,
I'm almost finished.

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:12.761
That's cool as fuck, bro.

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:14.763
I love it, actually.

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:20.368
This really amazing mixture
of science and artistic freedom.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.137
One of the oldest professions
in the world, actually.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:25.173
Oh yeah, besides prostitution.

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.642
I was watching this documentary
on the history channel

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:32.247
and it was called "sluts
of Mesopotamia" or something.

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:35.483
And, like, it was awesome.
Like yeah, anyway,

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:37.352
sorry, sorry,
doesn't matter, keep going.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.187
That's all right.

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:42.357
You're trying to pledge this,
like, really old fraternity.

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:45.560
You know, the pyramids,
the Eiffel Tower,

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.563
Brooklyn bridge, Burj Khalifa.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.632
Oh yeah, love his albums.
He's sick.

01:07:50.634 --> 01:07:52.767
No, that's wiz Kalifa.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:56.237
Burj Khalifa is one of the tallest
buildings in the world, actually.

01:07:56.239 --> 01:08:00.075
Anyway, you're trying to make
the next great thing.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:07.582
I've wanted
that for a long time.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.784
Just got a little sidetracked.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:11.219
That's a lot more noble

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:14.355
than I was expecting out of you.

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:15.356
What the hell's
going on out there?

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:17.125
It's getting really loud.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.495
Hey, hey, you can't leave.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:25.433
I'm not leaving,
I'm just gonna check it out.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.402
Well, what do you see?

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:31.639
Bunch of hipsters, guy with
a pretty sick mustache,

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.111
some out-of-work actors,
um, hippies.

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:38.113
Bunch of hippies out there.

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:42.117
- Oh, wonderful.
- No man, they're cool guys.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.885
- You sure about that?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:46.220
Those are my type
of people out there.

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:48.823
- So.
- Get fucked, Waldo.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:51.626
I have got a gun.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.261
I've got a dick.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.697
But neither one of us have
much need for it, do we?

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.232
Tell me where the money is.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:09:00.602
Or... or I'll make you
tell me.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.511
The safety's on.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:18.520
I've got something for you guys
to play cops and robbers with.

01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:19.554
Wow.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:22.189
That's great, mom.

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:24.192
Listen, I'm sorry
it took so long,

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.227
but I had trouble
finding everything

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.862
because it's not in
your father's closet anymore.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:30.165
We're gonna expand the bathroom.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:33.768
Yeah, I bought me one of those huge
bathtubs with the massage jets

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.737
so I knocked out
his whole closet.

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.906
When did you decide
to do all of this, mom?

01:09:37.908 --> 01:09:39.941
Well, he's been dead nine years,
he's not gonna miss it.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.743
Where's all my stuff, then?

01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:43.778
I put it in the garage.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.848
Oh, but I had to get rid of all
your magic the gathering cards,

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.750
I mean, they were everywhere.

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:51.752
So I gave it to that cute little
chinkster down the street.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:53.955
I mean, he doesn't seem
to have any friends either.

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:55.924
Mom, come on.

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:59.294
Oh, and I was gonna bring
your grandfather's claymores

01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.497
but they were nestled, stuck,
behind your Barbie's dream castle.

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:04.899
Okay, can we not...

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:07.235
Your family is terrifying.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.436
This is awesome.

01:10:08.438 --> 01:10:11.239
Hey, Pete, shut up.

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:12.907
Did you bring the gopro?

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:16.578
Did you... you know the camera,
with the strappy things?

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.912
Oh, you mean the sex camera?

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:22.350
No, it's not sex,
we use it for biking.

01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:24.652
Snowboarding and stuff
like that, not sex.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.854
Oh, okay, that makes sense.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:31.392
But like I'm tellin' ya,
I know you wanna be famous

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:34.862
but you're never gonna
be famous making a sex tape.

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:38.266
You know, I know your little
peepee, it's got a crook in it.

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:39.901
- Oh, no!
- And I think...

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:42.437
It's grown a lot.
A lot.

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.005
It's bigger than yours.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:48.509
Uh, my cock has never been
bigger than it is right now.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:53.648
Oh, I got you guys government-issue
standard Kevlar...

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:57.352
Jackets.

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.454
- Slip that in.
- That's for you, Pete.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:01.556
That's enough.
That's enough, mom stop.

01:11:01.558 --> 01:11:04.592
- Listen, thank you.
- G.I. Joe helmet, honey.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.327
He loves g.I. Joe.

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:08.396
Such a soft little head.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:09.964
There we go.

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:14.836
- Oh, and I'm taping the smurfs.
- Thanks, mom.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:17.705
I really don't wanna hurt you.

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:19.340
You're a fuck up.

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:21.609
I am not a fuck up.

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.478
I'm a success waiting to happen.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.614
Oh yeah, and
I'm Estelle Getty's twat.

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:30.818
Congratulations, kid,
you met a celebrity today.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.720
You just made an assassin mad.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:38.393
I hope you realize
that was a huge mistake,

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:41.763
because now
this is gonna happen.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.298
What, are you gonna
butter my bread?

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.633
No, I'm gonna cut
your fucking ear off.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.702
Don't do this to yourself, kid.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.370
Wrong answer.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.778
- Yeah, you feel anything yet?
- No, I don't.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:59.380
How about now?

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:02.483
Ow, ow, oh, ow.
Oh, oh, oh.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.819
You're killing me.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.888
Could you move, maybe...

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.423
Want me to move my head?

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:09.590
- A little bit, I can't see.
- Which way?

01:12:09.592 --> 01:12:11.359
- That way.
- To my left?

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:14.796
- Your left.
- All right.

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:17.031
Oh, it's getting red now.
Uh huh.

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:18.700
Oh yeah, wow.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:21.669
And you're...
Feeling nothing.

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:26.341
All right, this worked a lot
better when there was some music

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:30.878
to listen to
and the guy was scared.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.915
You could go outside and get
Liberace's iPod, bring it back...

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:37.051
Oh, I will break you, okay?

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.953
With a butter knife?

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.126
Fine.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:47.462
I think your first move
is to kick a chair.

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.664
You get in there, you kick it, you
kick the fuck outta that chair.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:51.065
You kick it straight across
the fucking room.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:52.867
Okay, and I'm gonna look
in your eyes,

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:57.405
you look at my eyes and we'll
look back in your eyes...

01:12:57.407 --> 01:12:59.540
And I'm gonna get
you on the gopro.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.043
- It'll probably scare the shit out of him.
- Absolutely.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:05.146
- I don't know, we just, like, remove
the injured hostages. -Exactly.

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:07.548
- So, uh...
- Yeah, what's up?

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.551
- Hey, hey guy. -So they're all ready
for you guys to come in, right?

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.453
Hey, when do I get...

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:13.821
When do I get to be on camera?

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.125
Uh, never?

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:18.860
- Never.
- Dude, you're a P.A.

01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:20.661
You said
I'd get a walk-on.

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:24.399
Oh, did we sign something
saying that?

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:25.733
That's fucked up.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:27.135
- This guy's the actor.
- That's fucked up.

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:28.503
I've been riling everybody
out here for you.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:30.838
Look how excited they are.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:31.873
Make noise.

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:38.746
Fine. Fine, okay, look.
We make our entrance, right?

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:42.784
And you come in after us.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:46.053
All right. All right,
do I enter here?

01:13:46.055 --> 01:13:47.822
- Or should I get in the car? -Don't
you fucking dare touch the car.

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:50.425
- Stay away from the car.
- Dare touch the fucking car.

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:54.128
Get out of here, go stand
with your people, okay? Fuck.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.130
Can I keep the gun?
Is that all right?

01:13:56.132 --> 01:14:01.736
This fucking guy. Fine, keep the
gun, but also, take my camera.

01:14:01.738 --> 01:14:05.973
Okay, my phone, my camera phone,
2-in-1, okay? So don't damage this.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:08.876
I want pictures of the entrance.

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:10.812
Okay?

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.046
Oh, come, come.

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:14.449
Now go mind the goddamn crowd!

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:16.484
Fucking shit.

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:18.519
We're gonna make a big entrance.

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:20.087
They're gonna come
right in here.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.823
I do not want him in our shot.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.858
No way, we'll cut him
out in post.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.126
Good job, skittles!

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.595
Remember our training.

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.498
We've been taking acting
classes for three years,

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.066
for this moment.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.003
Let's do it.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:38.473
Wait.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.641
What's our song?

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.210
You could help, by the way.

01:14:42.212 --> 01:14:45.513
Yeah, I could,
but I am not going to.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:47.081
I don't think
I like your attitude.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.649
Well, I don't think
I like anything about you,

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:50.251
so I guess that makes us even.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:51.552
Is that right?

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:54.088
Guys, could you please not?

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.790
Could I not?

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.992
Are you seriously asking
me to suppress my feelings?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.094
- Yes.
- Dr. Judith would...

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:02.029
Oh, go fucking
piss on Dr. Judith.

01:15:02.031 --> 01:15:04.098
I'm going to fucking slap
your bitch ass.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.166
Ladies!

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.852
Do you know who I am, Grady?

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:28.623
Uh, Tony Bennett's
swollen prostate?

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:42.737
I'm the guy
who's here to kill you.

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:46.574
Third one today, go figure.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:48.109
So you do know
what I'm doing here.

01:15:48.111 --> 01:15:49.610
What is this?

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:52.213
The world's slowest
moving short bus?

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:55.616
I'm gonna make it
really easy for you, okay?

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:59.153
There. Ain't.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:02.056
No.
Fucking money!

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:05.826
Told you he wouldn't budge.

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:09.697
If you'd indulge me, I'd really
like a chance to change your mind.

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:10.998
Go for it.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Thanks.

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.071
You hear that?

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.108
You have a cell phone?

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:23.678
Hey.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.946
Who you calling?

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.282
Señor.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:31.919
Where you going?
Señor!

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:34.188
Fuck!

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.656
Oh, jeez!

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.658
What is wrong with you people?

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.061
Because I am not staging the
biggest action sequence of my life

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:42.330
with fucking Kesha playing
in the background.

01:16:42.332 --> 01:16:46.067
I said no Demi Levato,
I agreed to no Demi Levato,

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:47.101
but what's wrong with Kesha?

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.936
She's a fucking icon!

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.671
So was Britney Spears
for a minute,

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:51.839
but I don't want it
playing in my ear

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:53.374
while I'm tearing
the house down.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:55.309
Okay, they'll be like,
"oh, what was your inspiration

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:57.078
for, like, saving all those
fucking people?" And I'm like

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.313
"oh, I don't know, uh,
Britney's video for 'toxic'

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.649
like really gets my balls
tied in a knot."

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.718
Better yet we'll listen
to radiohead

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.654
and get into the fetal position.

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:07.989
I said something with
a bad ass rock anthem!

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:10.825
What?

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.226
They're getting impatient.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:13.961
Let's go.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.697
- Fuck.
- Jesus, man.

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:22.703
Rock, paper, scissors.

01:17:22.705 --> 01:17:24.972
One takes it.
All right?

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.974
- One takes it?
- One takes it.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.143
- One takes it? -One, two, three,
shoot, then one takes it.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.312
One, two, three, shoot.

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:34.015
Yeah! Whoo!
Rock conquers all!

01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:35.116
You said one takes it.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:37.018
- I said one.
- You said one.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.419
That's not a one.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:39.854
- You said one!
- I didn't mean it literally.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:41.288
When did you
you change the rules?

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.858
You have scissors,
I automatically win by default.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:48.963
Buddy, you know,
we had every intention

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.999
in approaching you like
professionals.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:55.302
But it's clear to us
that you're withholding details,

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:58.339
which in my world is not
exactly an alluring quality.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.841
You understand?

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.177
You see, in my world,

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:06.847
a world in which
I am well-versed,

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.449
this is my language.

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:12.720
So as far as you're concerned,
I'm fucking Rosetta stone.

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:18.759
Now,

01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:21.095
I can look at a liar in the face

01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:25.332
and tell what he's gonna say
from the second he speaks.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:28.102
And you, my friend,

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.971
you're a goddamn liar.

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:33.307
I can smell it on you.

01:18:33.309 --> 01:18:36.877
Funny story.
I once knew a liar.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.179
Couldn't keep
his story straight.

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.781
So, he lost his head.

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:49.290
So, what's it gonna be, old man?

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:51.092
You gonna hang out
with our buddy down here

01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:54.729
or are you gonna play ball?

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:58.199
All right.

01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:01.268
First of all, my name's
not Grady, it's Gary.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.837
Gary Moskowitz.

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.438
But you're a southie.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:05.973
No, you putz.

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:09.410
I'm a Jew from New York.
Bayside, New York.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:13.214
My mother died in '62,
my father picked up,

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:16.016
came out here
with the insurance money

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:19.754
and what she'd left him,
he opened this place.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.422
It's called
"Jonny's sweet revenge"

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:26.961
because it was like the last
"fuck you" to the old lady.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:29.396
When he died, I came out
here and took over.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:31.165
That makes sense.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.467
The pictures on the wall,
Moskowitzs in all.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:35.436
What about the bank accounts?

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:37.438
That's all that matters.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.308
I have gambling debts
to not-really-nice people.

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.078
Unfortunately, lady luck
has smiled on me

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.947
about as much as any other
lady in this town.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.817
So the only entity
that's ever fucked me

01:19:49.819 --> 01:19:52.486
on a regular basis
is the Dallas cowboys.

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:56.524
So now I've got the bookies up
my ass and you guys up my ass.

01:19:56.526 --> 01:19:59.393
They all want money
that I don't have.

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:04.098
That's why I'm selling
the place, Princess.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.466
I believe him.

01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.868
Oh, you can't be serious.

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:09.937
We need something out of this.

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:11.372
I need something out of this.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.810
That sounded like it
came from the bar.

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:17.478
- Rick.
- -Oh, no.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:20.047
- You wanna untie the old man?
- -Not really.

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:27.354
- Oh, my god, Rick!
- Dammit.

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:29.857
- Fuck you.
- I'd like to see you try.

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:32.193
They shot me, Jesus Christ.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:34.929
I don't know why.

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.864
Aw! Fuck.

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:42.603
I would like to propose a trade.

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:45.206
Whoa, you speak English, dude?

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:47.041
You see a guy
with Hispanic features

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:49.844
and assume he's Mexican?

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:51.345
You mean, you're not Mexican?

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:54.248
Well, no, I am Mexican.

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.250
I mean, my father...

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:59.954
My father is Mexican.
I'm from Alhambra.

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:01.455
Oh, I've been to Alhambra,

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:03.424
that exit 22 off the freeway.
They got that Jamba...

01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:05.993
Whoa, how'd you get in?

01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:08.963
Through the back door.

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:10.497
It's simple.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:14.101
You get your friend back
and I get what I came for.

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:15.269
And what's that?

01:21:17.973 --> 01:21:20.374
Hey, I don't give a shit.

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:23.077
But I'm not
a bargaining chip, okay?

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:27.147
I'm a human.
I'm a fucking veteran.

01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:30.317
- Fuck you.
- You know, maybe,

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:33.187
you shouldn't borrow
what you can't pay back

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:35.990
do you have the money
or not, Grady?

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.359
How much does he owe?

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:42.396
$47,258.52.

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:43.597
So what's it gonna be?

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:45.599
The old man
or the walking wounded?

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:53.574
- The old man.
- What?

01:21:53.576 --> 01:21:55.175
Time to go, baby.

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:56.477
Okay, okay.

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:04.018
Marsha, hold up.

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:11.692
You are all, without a doubt
in my mind,

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:16.597
the coldest, most selfish,
conniving...

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:19.166
- One love.
- Passive aggressive.

01:22:19.168 --> 01:22:22.202
Passive aggressive
bottom feeders

01:22:22.204 --> 01:22:24.672
I've ever come
across in all my years.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:28.709
Make it loud!

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:36.744
Sometimes, I have moments
of clarity,

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:38.512
these great epiphanies,

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.215
where I wonder if my true
talents aren't being wasted,

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:44.318
if I have anything to add
to the human condition.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.154
So, thank you

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:48.789
for today.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:52.192
Because whenever I begin to
question my station in life,

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:55.329
I'm gonna think about you,

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:58.232
and I'm gonna be grateful
that I'm not you.

01:23:58.234 --> 01:24:02.403
You see folks,
this is only a job,

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:04.471
and I'll always be me.

01:24:04.473 --> 01:24:06.673
And when you think about it,

01:24:06.675 --> 01:24:10.577
that's a pretty
wonderful way to be.

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:15.416
Yeah, that's just one guy's
opinion. Whatever dude.

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.651
- All righty then, vamanos.

01:24:17.653 --> 01:24:19.086
Did you hear that shit?

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:22.389
What the fuck?

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:58.292
Pete, Pete, Pete!
You know what you need to do!

01:24:58.294 --> 01:24:59.460
Shit.

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:01.228
I'm totally bleeding.

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:04.231
They killed Trevor!

01:25:04.233 --> 01:25:05.866
Pete, who the fuck is Trevor?

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:09.269
Skittles,
the production assistant!

01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:13.407
I got it on the gopro, though.
We're gonna be heroes.

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:14.842
Action stars.

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:15.536
Okay, everybody go!

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:22.276
I fucking love you!
I fucking love you!

01:26:22.278 --> 01:26:23.577
Don't fucking die!

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:29.483
You all right, Tessa?

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:31.752
Yep, dandy.

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:37.457
Hold the phone.
Hold on.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.194
What's happening, Pete?

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.433
Nobody shoot.

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:54.474
Don't you fucking move.

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:56.843
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.

01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:59.546
Tried that one already,

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.281
but nobody seems to listen.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:04.651
We can work something out.

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:05.986
Hey.

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.824
You killed my P.A.,
motherfucker.

01:27:10.826 --> 01:27:12.426
You can kiss my Mexican ass.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.835
You're on Instagram, bitch!

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.373
What a bunch of fucking idiots.

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:29.476
Wow, you guys are
straight-up murderers.

01:27:29.478 --> 01:27:32.613
You just shot that guy
in the head and he gave up.

01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:34.381
I felt threatened, okay?
Do you feel threatened?

01:27:34.383 --> 01:27:36.250
Because I felt threatened.

01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:37.492
I feel a little bit threatened.

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.390
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:46.760
We ain't through with you, yet.

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:53.500
Hey, everyone, let's just
put it down, okay?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.938
Not you, Callahan.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:01.308
Pick up the gun.
You guys put it down.

01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:03.677
Okay, now...

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:05.512
Why the hell are you pointing
the gun at me?

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:09.349
Everyone else was taken.

01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:10.984
You know what
they call this, Reni?

01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:12.419
What's that?

01:28:12.421 --> 01:28:13.854
Meaningful cooperative
experience

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:16.757
of the nurturing embrace
of common moral virtue.

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:20.060
You guys really should consider
getting new therapists.

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:22.429
We're not really ones to talk.

01:28:22.431 --> 01:28:23.697
What are you talking about?

01:28:23.699 --> 01:28:24.931
Nothing.

01:28:24.933 --> 01:28:26.700
No, you know what, if I get shot

01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:28.935
I am not going out
with this on my conscience.

01:28:28.937 --> 01:28:31.505
What are you talking about?

01:28:31.507 --> 01:28:32.906
I fucked your brother.

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:37.611
I fucked him in the office earlier.
I fucked him.

01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:38.979
That's heavy.

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:40.380
Brian, look, it was an accident.

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:41.481
We were tied up and then...

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:45.552
She just slipped onto your dick.

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:49.923
Time keeps passing on,
but romance stays the same.

01:28:49.925 --> 01:28:51.658
It really was an accident.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.360
He's telling the truth.

01:28:53.362 --> 01:28:56.330
It was my fault.

01:28:56.332 --> 01:28:58.598
So what now?

01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.599
What do we do now?

01:28:59.601 --> 01:29:03.036
There is no we.

01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:06.540
There's a you and a me.

01:29:06.542 --> 01:29:09.609
It's over.

01:29:09.611 --> 01:29:13.046
It was over
before we got here, huh?

01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:15.082
This is how I die,

01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:16.917
in a barroom massacre.

01:29:16.919 --> 01:29:17.918
This is it.

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.554
Let's do it.

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:24.491
What if I had like a crazy idea?

01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:26.493
I'm down to hear that.

01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:28.562
Okay, so you know all those
people outside,

01:29:28.564 --> 01:29:31.832
those are, like,
potential customers.

01:29:31.834 --> 01:29:33.500
We were filming them.

01:29:33.502 --> 01:29:38.572
I actually I told them this
street was closed down,

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:42.776
we're actually building a sound
stage inside. I'm sorry.

01:29:42.778 --> 01:29:44.611
No man, it's okay.
Those are my people.

01:29:44.613 --> 01:29:47.114
Like, that's the sort
of stuff they're into.

01:29:47.116 --> 01:29:50.484
Like old divey bars
with a history.

01:29:50.486 --> 01:29:54.855
I mean, it's just like the farmer's
market but with, like, alcohol.

01:29:54.857 --> 01:29:57.157
I don't know how to make
this any clearer.

01:29:57.159 --> 01:29:58.992
I'm not keeping the place.

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:00.994
You don't have to.

01:30:00.996 --> 01:30:03.063
You could sell it to me.
Sully could lend me the money.

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:06.400
And I could run this place.
I could do it.

01:30:06.402 --> 01:30:07.968
Yeah, I guess so, Brian.

01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:09.503
That's all
well and good, fellas.

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:11.471
What about the rest of us?

01:30:11.473 --> 01:30:13.173
Vin, you know this place
better than anyone.

01:30:13.175 --> 01:30:14.541
You could run it.

01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:16.610
But what about all
the dead bodies?

01:30:16.612 --> 01:30:18.678
Blame the Mexicans.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.480
What?

01:30:20.482 --> 01:30:22.816
Oh shut up, like you weren't
all thinking the same thing.

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.055
We...
We can't let that fly.

01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:31.825
- It leaves us as the morons who let it happen.
- It's not good.

01:30:31.827 --> 01:30:35.162
Guys, I vote we just burn this
fucking place to the ground.

01:30:35.164 --> 01:30:36.897
Leave the dead bodies inside.

01:30:36.899 --> 01:30:40.000
What the fuck good
is that gonna do?

01:30:40.002 --> 01:30:42.469
- The insurance money.
- -Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:30:42.471 --> 01:30:44.704
Moskowitz can keep the money

01:30:44.706 --> 01:30:47.441
and then we could
rebuild the bar.

01:30:47.443 --> 01:30:51.211
Oh shit, Rick, you could help
design the new place.

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:52.813
That'd be awesome.

01:30:52.815 --> 01:30:55.015
Yeah, Rick is like
a totally good architect.

01:30:55.017 --> 01:30:58.051
I'm finishing school, but yeah.

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:03.957
Yeah, and then the detectives can take Rick
and Tessa out of here and look like heroes.

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:07.861
And then the rest of us can just escape
out back into the Mexicans' Van.

01:31:07.863 --> 01:31:11.731
And Sully can help me make up a
nice business plan that works.

01:31:11.733 --> 01:31:13.467
He's like crazy good
at that sort of stuff,

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:14.468
you guys don't even know.

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:16.503
What about me?

01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:17.838
You get off clean.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.473
That's a pretty good deal.

01:31:19.475 --> 01:31:23.109
You know what, I want some
of that insurance money.

01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:25.212
Oh, please,
just chill out, okay?

01:31:25.214 --> 01:31:27.881
Tell me I got a piece of that pie
or I will shoot your ass down.

01:31:27.883 --> 01:31:29.816
Please, do not do this.

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:31.618
Please.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.853
Why the hell are
you defending them

01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:35.655
after what they just did to you?

01:31:35.657 --> 01:31:37.657
She's always wanted him,

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:39.593
or at least the idea of him.

01:31:39.595 --> 01:31:43.597
I'll find my own
good vibe on... whatever.

01:31:43.599 --> 01:31:47.100
I'll be fine, okay.
Just live and let die, man.

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:50.904
I thought you were with me.

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:55.775
There's something about a girl
who orders a bloody Mary.

01:31:57.812 --> 01:32:00.647
Something mysterious.

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:03.250
I need that.

01:32:03.252 --> 01:32:06.520
I am with you.

01:32:06.522 --> 01:32:08.121
We won't get
what we came here for.

01:32:08.123 --> 01:32:10.857
I think I already did.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.559
I don't want their money.

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.263
What do you say?

01:32:16.265 --> 01:32:17.931
Are you with me?

01:34:30.065 --> 01:34:31.931
So, where next?

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:36.903
Well...

01:34:36.905 --> 01:34:39.239
There's a spoon factory
I want to stop by.

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:44.210
Just take a second.

01:34:44.212 --> 01:34:46.046
It's Charley hart exposed

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:53.787
what are you, the expert now?

01:34:53.789 --> 01:34:55.889
No, just being me.
