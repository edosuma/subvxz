WEBVTT

00:12.900 --> 00:14.533
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.567 --> 00:16.233
(Miranda) PATIENT'S NAME?
(Cristina) ELLIS GREY.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.433
MEREDITH'S MOTHER.
IT'S NOT THAT BURKE

00:18.467 --> 00:21.567
BROKE UP WITH ME,
IT'S HOW HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.333
HAVE YOU EVEN BOTHERED TO
TELL BURKE ABOUT THE BABY?

00:24.367 --> 00:26.333
CRISTINA!
(Addison) IT WAS
AN EXTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY.

00:26.367 --> 00:29.833
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.
STOP TALKING TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.

00:29.867 --> 00:31.633
STOP TALKING TO ME
AT ALL.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.500
IF YOU CAME OUT HERE
TO TRY TO WIN ME BACK,

00:33.533 --> 00:36.100
YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT IT.
I JUST KNOW
I STILL LOVE YOU.

00:36.133 --> 00:39.300
HATING YOU
IS THE MOST EXHAUSTING.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.433
(Meredith) THE KEY TO SURVIVING
A SURGICAL INTERNSHIP

00:50.467 --> 00:52.100
IS DENIAL.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.033
WE DENY THAT WE'RE TIRED.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.600
WE DENY THAT WE'RE SCARED.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.833
WE DENY HOW BADLY
WE WANNA SUCCEED.

00:57.867 --> 01:00.733
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE DENY THAT WE'RE IN DENIAL.

01:00.767 --> 01:02.267
I DON'T KNOW.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.200
WHEN I LEFT,
CRISTINA SAID SHE WAS OKAY.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.133
NOBODY GOES THROUGH
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH

01:06.167 --> 01:08.367
AND IS TOTALLY OVER IT
BY NOW.
CRISTINA CAN.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.433
SHE'S FINE.
TOO FINE. SHE'S COLD.

01:10.467 --> 01:12.367
NO, SHE'S HARD-CORE.
SHE'S GOT ICE IN HER VEINS.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.800
SHE DOES WHAT SHE HAS TO
TO GET THROUGH.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.733
SHE LOST A BABY.
SHE LOST A FALLOPIAN TUBE.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.667
AND SHE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE DOESN'T EVEN CARE.

01:18.700 --> 01:21.333
SHE'S ALL, "HELLO,
I'M TOTALLY FINE" PERSON.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.667
I MEAN, SHE'S MY FRIEND, TOO,
BUT SHE'S ACTING LIKE

01:23.700 --> 01:25.633
SHE HAS NO EMOTIONS OR WARMTH,
LIKE SHE'S MISSING A SOUL.

01:25.667 --> 01:27.533
GOD, SHE IS GONNA MAKE
A GREAT SURGEON.

01:27.567 --> 01:29.500
GEORGE.
IT'S TRUE.

01:29.533 --> 01:31.567
YOU SHOW NO WEAKNESS,
YOU MAKE IT TO THE TOP.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.133
SOME PEOPLE JUST KEEP
THEIR FEELINGS TO THEMSELVES.

01:34.167 --> 01:36.267
WE ONLY SEE
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE

01:36.300 --> 01:39.100
AND BELIEVE
WHAT WE WANT TO BELIEVE.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.600
AND IT WORKS.

01:40.633 --> 01:42.833
WE LIE
TO OURSELVES SO MUCH THAT,

01:42.867 --> 01:44.833
AFTER AWHILE, THE LIES
START TO SEEM LIKE THE TRUTH.

01:44.867 --> 01:46.533
MEREDITH KISSED ME.

01:46.567 --> 01:47.733
ADDISON KISSED ME.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.767
MY WIFE AND MY GIRLFRIEND
KISSED ME

01:49.800 --> 01:52.267
ON THE SAME DAY.
JOE...

01:52.300 --> 01:53.600
DO I LOOK FRIENDLY
TO YOU?

01:53.633 --> 01:55.433
OH, YOU'RE A TINY
LITTLE KITTEN

01:55.467 --> 01:57.167
OF JOY AND LOVE.

01:58.733 --> 02:01.200
WHAT? HE SAVED MY LIFE.
HIS FIRST MISTAKE.

02:01.233 --> 02:03.233
McDREAMY, GO SIT
BY SOMEONE WHO CARES.

02:03.267 --> 02:05.400
WE DENY SO MUCH

02:05.433 --> 02:07.333
THAT WE CAN'T RECOGNIZE
THE TRUTH

02:07.367 --> 02:09.267
RIGHT IN FRONT
OF OUR FACES.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.633
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.567
ADDISON WILL GO BACK
TO NEW YORK,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.500
MEREDITH AND I
WILL START OVER.

02:14.533 --> 02:17.133
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE,
RIGHT?

02:17.167 --> 02:19.433
YOU SO DAMN STUPID.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.267
I WANT EVERYONE
FOCUSED TODAY.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.067
WITH CRISTINA OUT,
WE'RE SHORT AN INTERN,

02:27.100 --> 02:29.533
AND I HAVE A FEELIN'
IT'S GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.467
AND, KAREV, SEE THE CHIEF
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.700
WHAT FOR?

02:32.733 --> 02:34.333
DO I LOOK PSYCHIC
TO YOU?

02:34.367 --> 02:35.700
HE'S THE CHIEF.
HE ASKED, YOU GO.

02:35.733 --> 02:37.267
WHAT DID HE DO NOW?

02:37.300 --> 02:38.600
MAYBE HE GAVE
THE CHIEF SYPHILIS.

02:38.633 --> 02:41.267
SO WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE BELIZEAN JUNGLE,

02:41.300 --> 02:42.367
AND THIS JAGUARUNDI
JUMPS OUT

02:42.400 --> 02:44.700
AND BITES ONE OF THE GUIDES.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.233
THEY ALL LOOK AT ME.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.167
THEY'RE YELLING,
"YOU'RE A DOCTOR. HELP HIM."

02:48.200 --> 02:50.800
THIS IS ONE TIME A PhD
DOES NO GOOD.

02:50.833 --> 02:53.333
I'M SORRY. DID I MISS
THE BELL FOR SOCIAL HOUR?

02:53.367 --> 02:55.767
TALES OF MISSIONARY LIFE.
YOU'RE A MISSIONARY?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.233
NO, MY PARENTS.
WE TRAVELED A LOT.

02:57.267 --> 02:58.467
THEY STILL DO.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.200
OH, WOW.
THIS STUFF IS GREAT.

03:00.233 --> 03:02.167
UM, THIS IS
DR. BURKE'S PATIENT--

03:03.367 --> 03:04.367
KALPANA.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.233
NAMED BY VILLAGERS
IN NEPAL.

03:07.267 --> 03:09.167
UH, SHE PRESENTS WITH
MULTIPLE SYNCOPAL EPISODES

03:09.200 --> 03:10.633
AND VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.100
SO YOU'VE BEEN PASSING OUT?

03:12.133 --> 03:13.467
YEAH,
AND HAVING PALPITATIONS.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.300
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
OF RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE

03:16.333 --> 03:17.800
WITH MITRAL VALVE
STENOSIS.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.733
THEY HAD TO SHIP ME
FROM ZAMBIA TO THE STATES

03:19.767 --> 03:21.667
FOR 3 MONTHS OF TREATMENT
WHEN I WAS 8.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.467
RHEUMATIC FEVER
ALMOST KILLED ME.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.200
DR. STEVENS, WHAT ARE
THE PRIMARY CAUSES

03:26.233 --> 03:27.400
OF VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS?

03:27.433 --> 03:29.300
(Cristina) VALVULAR DISEASE,

03:29.333 --> 03:31.233
MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE,
STIMULANTS, DRUGS

03:31.267 --> 03:34.067
AND METABOLIC ABNORMALITIES.

03:35.167 --> 03:36.833
WHAT?

03:36.867 --> 03:38.633
OUT.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.200
I'M FINE.
OUT.

03:40.233 --> 03:43.500
YOU BETTER BE IN YOUR ROOM
BY THE TIME WE ROUND ON YOU.
AND WHEN WILL THAT BE?

03:43.533 --> 03:46.233
IN 15 SECONDS.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.800
14... 13...

03:47.833 --> 03:49.533
12... 11...

03:49.567 --> 03:51.133
NICE PANTIES, YANG.

03:51.167 --> 03:53.367
(laughter)

03:53.400 --> 03:57.067
IN YOUR DREAMS...
(whispers) EVIL SPAWN.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.433
(Meredith) CRISTINA YANG.

03:58.467 --> 04:00.600
POST-OP, DAY THREE, FROM
A UNILATERAL SALPINGECTOMY--

04:00.633 --> 04:02.533
AND READY TO GET
BACK TO WORK.

04:02.567 --> 04:03.633
IS SHE?

04:03.667 --> 04:04.600
I'M TAKING SOLIDS

04:04.633 --> 04:06.667
AND MY PAIN IS CONTROLLED
WITH ORAL MEDS.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.167
I'M READY.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.233
DIDN'T THE NURSE SAY
THIS MORNING YOU HAD A FEVER?

04:10.267 --> 04:11.400
MOTHER.

04:11.433 --> 04:13.533
CRISTINA,
DID YOU HAVE A FEVER?

04:15.733 --> 04:18.267
TEMP SPIKED TO 101
LAST NIGHT. BIG DEAL.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.767
SHE WORKED 2 SHIFTS LAST MONTH
WITH A 102-DEGREE FLU.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.133
YES, EXACTLY, GEORGE.
THANK YOU.

04:22.167 --> 04:23.833
AND WE APPRECIATE
YOUR DEDICATION,

04:23.867 --> 04:25.767
BUT YOU'RE STAYING IN BED
UNTIL IT NORMALIZES.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.700
I KEEP TELLING HER
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE

04:27.733 --> 04:29.600
THAN SURGERY AND CAREER.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.467
MOTHER,
GO UPHOLSTER SOMETHING.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.400
LOOK, I NEED YOU TO RELAX,
SHUT UP AND GET BETTER.

04:34.433 --> 04:38.067
YOU'RE A PATIENT THIS WEEK SO
YOU CAN BE A DOCTOR NEXT WEEK.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.633
UNDERSTAND?
COME HERE. MERE.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.233
YOU CANNOT LEAVE ME ALONE
WITH HER.

04:41.267 --> 04:42.733
I AM FLYING
OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST HERE.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.067
YOU HAVE TO SAVE ME.
YOU NEED TIME TO HEAL.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.067
I'M HEALED.
I'M HEALED!

04:51.667 --> 04:53.667
OH, GOD.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.200
OKAY, DR. O'MALLEY,
YOU'RE PRESENTING.

04:56.233 --> 04:58.400
OKAY, DR. GREY
IS POST-OP, DAY THREE,

04:58.433 --> 05:00.100
FROM A TUMOR RESECTION.
SH--

05:00.133 --> 05:01.433
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.200
HE'S GOT IT ALL WRONG.
IT'S NOT ASTHMA, IT'S GERD.

05:04.233 --> 05:05.767
HE NEEDS
A NISSEN FUNDOPLICATION.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.433
I DON'T WANT HER
IN THE ROOM.
MOM.

05:08.467 --> 05:11.067
SHE'S A CHILD,
AND I WON'T HAVE HER ON MY TEAM.

05:11.067 --> 05:13.633
WE'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE,
DR. GREY.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.667
(pager beeps)

05:20.267 --> 05:21.467
YOU SKIPPING ROUNDS?

05:21.500 --> 05:23.133
AVOIDING MOTHER.

05:23.167 --> 05:24.100
MEREDITH...

05:24.133 --> 05:25.267
YOU'VE GOT A WIFE.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.300
YES.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.833
YOUR LIFE IS COMPLICATED.
YES.

05:27.867 --> 05:28.733
I DON'T NEED COMPLICATED.

05:28.767 --> 05:31.700
I HAVE COMPLICATED
ALL ON MY OWN.
YES.

05:31.733 --> 05:33.600
STOP SAYING YES.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.567
TRY NOT TO MAKE
ANY SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.

05:36.633 --> 05:39.233
YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY.
ADDISON'S LEAVING.

05:39.267 --> 05:41.567
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE
PATIENTS IN THIS HOSPITAL.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.500
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR HER TO BE HERE.
NO REASON?

05:43.533 --> 05:45.267
NONE WHATSOEVER.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.200
WELL, ISN'T THIS COZY?

05:47.233 --> 05:48.400
CAN I JOIN IN,

05:48.433 --> 05:50.367
OR ARE YOU NOT
INTO THREESOMES?

05:51.667 --> 05:53.467
I HAVE TO GO.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.800
MEREDITH...

05:55.833 --> 05:57.500
YOU REALLY ARE SATAN.

05:57.533 --> 05:59.567
YOU REALIZE THAT, RIGHT?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.500
IF SATAN WERE TO TAKE
PHYSICAL FORM, HE'D BE YOU,

06:01.533 --> 06:03.433
EVERYWHERE, ALL THE TIME.
I AM SO NOT SATAN.

06:03.467 --> 06:05.367
HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ON YOUR BROOMSTICK

06:05.400 --> 06:08.200
AND GONE BACK TO NEW YORK
WHERE YOU BELONG?
STOP BEING PETTY.

06:08.233 --> 06:09.333
STOP BEING
AN ADULTEROUS BITCH.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.300
YOU KNOW YOU ARE GOING TO
FORGIVE ME EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

06:12.333 --> 06:15.133
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST--
I MEAN, THERE WAS A TIME

06:15.167 --> 06:17.067
WHERE YOU THOUGHT OF ME
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.833
THERE WAS A TIME
WHERE I THOUGHT

06:18.867 --> 06:20.600
YOU WERE
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

06:20.633 --> 06:22.067
THINGS CHANGE.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.300
DIVORCE PAPERS.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.233
YOUR LAWYER SAID
THEY'RE OKAY.

06:34.267 --> 06:35.600
I HAVEN'T SIGNED 'EM YET.

06:35.633 --> 06:37.533
THE BALL'S IN YOUR COURT.
IF YOU SIGN, I'LL SIGN.

06:37.567 --> 06:41.067
I'LL... SIGN AND BE ON
THE FIRST PLANE OUT OF HERE.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.567
I'LL SIGN THEM IMMEDIATELY.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.067
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.533
DEREK, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
THAT EVEN IF I AM SATAN

06:49.567 --> 06:51.200
AND AN ADULTEROUS BITCH

06:51.233 --> 06:54.200
THAT I STILL MIGHT BE
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?

07:13.100 --> 07:17.700
***

07:17.733 --> 07:21.467
(Woman) * NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THEY MIGHT END UP *

07:21.500 --> 07:23.800
* NOBODY KNOWS

07:32.600 --> 07:34.367
* OH, OH

07:34.400 --> 07:38.200
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

07:55.600 --> 07:57.100
IT'S MY CHART.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.400
YOU'RE THE PATIENT,
NOT THE DOCTOR.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.400
ACT LIKE ONE.

08:01.433 --> 08:03.700
IT'S BEEN TOUGH
FINDING YOU ALONE.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.300
YEAH. WELL...

08:05.333 --> 08:07.067
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

08:07.100 --> 08:09.633
WELL, YOU HAVE MY CHART.
YOU TELL ME.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

08:14.733 --> 08:17.200
I'M FINE.
PERFECTLY OKAY.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.700
I HAD A RIGHT TO KNOW.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.400
WELL, NOW YOU DO.
CRISTINA--

08:21.433 --> 08:23.333
LOOK, NOW YOU KNOW.
IT'S OVER.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.267
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU TO DEAL WITH,

08:25.300 --> 08:26.467
SO I DON'T KNOW.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.233
WHAT ELSE IS THERE
REALLY LEFT TO SAY?

08:29.267 --> 08:32.533
PLENTY. FOR STARTERS,
YOU COULD'VE COME TO ME--
OH, LOOK, IT'S MY MOTHER.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.067
DR. PRESTON BURKE. NICE TO
MEET YOU, MRS. YANG.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.600
ACTUALLY, IT'S RUBENSTEIN.

08:38.633 --> 08:41.300
DR. SAUL RUBENSTEIN
OF BEVERLY HILLS,

08:41.333 --> 08:43.200
THE ORAL SURGEON.

08:43.233 --> 08:45.133
I'M REMARRIED.

08:45.167 --> 08:47.400
BEEN REMARRIED SINCE
CRISTINA WAS, WHAT, ABOUT 3?

08:47.433 --> 08:49.367
MOM, THAT'S
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.667
HE HAS OTHER THINGS
TO DO.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.767
YOU'RE GOOD-LOOKING.
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.200
WHY DON'T YOU EVER BRING HOME
A MAN AS GOOD-LOOKING AS HIM?

08:57.233 --> 08:58.367
STOP.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.367
WHAT?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.300
STOP TALKING.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.367
CRISTINA!
FORGIVE HER.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I EVER DID

09:05.333 --> 09:07.267
TO RAISE
SUCH AN UNPLEASANT GIRL.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.367
OH, ME, UNPL--
I'M UNPLEASANT?

09:09.400 --> 09:11.167
EXCUSE ME.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.300
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THAT WAS?
WHO?

09:14.333 --> 09:16.267
THAT WAS MY--
THAT WAS MY BOSS.

09:16.300 --> 09:19.167
I WAS VERY NICE TO HIM.
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
CALL MY "UNPLEASANT"

09:19.200 --> 09:21.333
IN FRONT OF MY BOSS?
LIGHTEN UP, PLEASE.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.733
OKAY, I WAS THINKING
THAT MAYBE WE MIGHT WANNA--

09:23.767 --> 09:25.433
YOU MIGHT...

09:25.467 --> 09:27.367
OKAY, WE BOTH HAVE
TONIGHT OFF, SO--

09:27.400 --> 09:28.567
YOU ARE SO INTO ME.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.233
SHUT UP.

09:30.267 --> 09:32.167
IT'S SAD--THE WORSHIP,
THE ADORATION.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.100
AND I'M SO HANDSOME,
I INTOXICATE YOU.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.067
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.133
IZZIE, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO OUT WITH ME TONIGHT

09:38.167 --> 09:39.600
ON A DATE?

09:39.633 --> 09:42.467
YOU WEAR SOMETHING GORGEOUS,
I PAY FOR FOOD.
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.800
I'M NOT MAKING FUN
OF YOU.
OKAY, THEN.

09:44.833 --> 09:46.600
GOOD.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.267
GOOD.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.733
(Miranda) THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
I NEVER WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.567
THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO LAZY

09:52.600 --> 09:53.367
TO LEARN ANYTHING MORE.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.200
DR. MEREDITH GREY,
JEREMIAH TATE.

09:55.233 --> 09:57.067
THINKS HE KNOWS SO MUCH
BECAUSE HE WAS

09:57.100 --> 09:59.267
ONE OF MY FIRST PATIENTS
AS AN INTERN.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.633
I KNEW AS MUCH AS SHE DID.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.733
SHE WAS CLUELESS ABOUT
HOW TO TREAT CYSTIC FIBROSIS.

10:02.767 --> 10:05.100
A SIMPLE CHOLECYSTECTOMY
TURNED INTO A MONTH-LONG STAY.

10:05.133 --> 10:07.033
YOU BETTER NOT BE
ALLEGING MALPRACTICE.

10:07.067 --> 10:09.467
GUY RAISES ABOUT 100 GRAND
A YEAR FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS

10:09.500 --> 10:10.700
RUNNIN' TRIATHLONS

10:10.733 --> 10:12.367
THINKS HE'S A BIG SHOT.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.633
YOU RUN TRIATHLONS?

10:13.667 --> 10:15.600
WHY NOT?
PAIN, FOR ONE.

10:15.633 --> 10:17.567
IT SAYS HERE YOU'RE FINALLY
ADMITTIN' TO FEELIN' A LITTLE.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.433
A LITTLE.
HOW LITTLE?

10:19.467 --> 10:20.300
TRUTH.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.267
WELL, ENOUGH TO KEEP ME
AWAKE AT NIGHT.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.833
HAD SOME SEIZURES. UM...

10:26.867 --> 10:28.767
TOO WEAK TO WORK OUT.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
ANYONE BEEN THROUGH HERE
WITH YOUR C.T. RESULTS?

10:30.733 --> 10:35.233
NO. IT'S PROBABLY JUST
MY PANCREATITIS

10:35.267 --> 10:37.167
KICKING UP AGAIN.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.633
WE'LL BE BACK WITH YOUR RESULTS
AND A PLAN.

10:39.667 --> 10:43.333
WHERE DO YOUR PARENTS
THINK YOU ARE THIS TIME?

10:43.367 --> 10:45.300
NEW ORLEANS.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.033
WHAT ABOUT HIS PARENTS?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.800
NO, HE DOESN'T
LIKE TO BOTHER THEM

10:52.833 --> 10:55.433
UNTIL HE'S WELL
OR ABOUT TO GET DISCHARGED.

10:55.467 --> 10:57.367
HE UNDERSTANDS HIS REALITY.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.567
HE JUST CHOOSES TO IGNORE IT.
DENIAL WORKS FOR HIM, GREY.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.767
"ABDOMINAL PAIN.
ABDOMINAL PAIN.

11:03.800 --> 11:09.200
"PERIRECTAL ABSCESS.
GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE HEAD."

11:09.233 --> 11:11.133
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
G.S.W. TO THE HEAD?

11:11.167 --> 11:13.533
WHY WASN'T THE TRAUMA TEAM
CALLED?

11:13.567 --> 11:15.667
HELLO?
ARE YOU PEOPLE INSANE?

11:15.700 --> 11:18.533
THERE'S YOUR GUNSHOT VICTIM.

11:18.567 --> 11:19.800
HIM?

11:25.067 --> 11:28.467
I'M REDOING THE LIVING ROOM
IN BEIGE SILKS,

11:28.500 --> 11:30.633
I'M THINKING.

11:30.667 --> 11:35.067
AND MODERN. VERY MID-CENTURY.
AND THE DINING ROOM--

11:35.100 --> 11:37.133
MOTHER,
GIVE ME BACK MY TOES.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.800
OKAY. I'LL CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.667
WHO'S THE FATHER?

11:43.700 --> 11:44.767
MID-CENTURY, DID YOU SAY?

11:44.800 --> 11:46.433
SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH,
RIGHT?

11:46.467 --> 11:48.367
OR IS IT JUST
FOR SEX?

11:48.400 --> 11:52.067
YOU MADE SUCH A POINT
OF NOT FORMING ATTACHMENTS.

11:52.067 --> 11:55.300
20 MINUTES. ALL I WANT IS
20 MINUTES OF PEACE AND QUIET.

11:55.333 --> 11:59.800
THE DAUGHTER I RAISED WOULD
APPRECIATE HER MOTHER'S HELP.

11:59.833 --> 12:03.733
THE DAUGHTER YOU RAISED IS
BEGGING FOR YOU TO GO NOW.

12:03.767 --> 12:07.433
I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME HERE.
YOU KNOW, I'M VERY BUSY.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.600
I KNOW. YEAH, I KNOW,
REDECORATING YOUR HOUSE.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.800
WELL, CAN YOU GET ME
A MOCHA LATTE, PLEASE?

12:16.833 --> 12:19.067
A NONFAT ONE.

12:19.067 --> 12:20.333
NO, A FAT ONE.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.367
AH. WELL, YOU'RE WALKING.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.667
YOU'RE TALKING.
THERE'S NO EXIT WOUND.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.167
THIS MARK HERE
LOOKS MORE LIKE A BURN.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.067
I'M TELLING YOU,
I SHOT MYSELF--

12:36.100 --> 12:37.833
PULLED THE TRIGGER
WHILE I WAS CLEANING MY .22.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.767
I THOUGHT THE CLIP WAS OUT.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.767
IF YOU'RE THINKIN' SUICIDE,
DON'T.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.233
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
I MADE A MISTAKE...

12:45.267 --> 12:47.633
AND NOW I'M PAYIN' FOR IT.
(sighs)

12:47.667 --> 12:49.800
BUT I DID SHOOT MYSELF.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.267
WHERE'S YOUR I.V.?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.200
I'M TAKING SOLIDS.
I HEP-LOCKED IT.

12:59.233 --> 13:01.433
ON WHOSE ORDERS?
MINE.

13:01.467 --> 13:05.333
OKAY. "YANG."

13:05.367 --> 13:08.067
HOW ABOUT THIS ORDER?
"BED REST,

13:08.100 --> 13:09.833
"OUT OF BED TO CHAIR,
BATHROOM PRIVILEGES."

13:09.867 --> 13:12.067
NOTHIN' ABOUT STEALING CHARTS
AT THE NURSES' STATION.

13:12.067 --> 13:16.200
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HEY, HEY, HEY! GIVE ME THAT.

13:16.233 --> 13:19.800
AH. AH. THERE. SATISFIED?

13:19.833 --> 13:21.733
I'M OUT OF BED TO CHAIR.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.233
I'M TELLING
YOUR INTERN ON YOU.
MEREDITH?

13:24.267 --> 13:27.167
YEAH.
OOH, I'M SO SCARED.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.400
DR. GREY,
HOW ARE YOU DOIN'?

13:35.433 --> 13:36.700
YOU'RE HERE. GOOD.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.733
I NEED THE RESULTS
OF THE BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM

13:38.767 --> 13:42.133
OR THE E.G.D.,
AND YOU HAVE NEITHER. OKAY.

13:42.167 --> 13:44.367
NO WORRIES. I'LL BE HERE
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.367
SO TODAY,
YOU'RE HER INTERN, HMM?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.267
WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN BEIN' HER HUSBAND.

13:48.300 --> 13:50.200
WELL, THAT'S A MATTER
OF OPINION.

13:50.233 --> 13:52.133
GOOD MORNING, ELLIS.

13:52.167 --> 13:55.400
RICHARD, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I NEED THOSE LABS IMMEDIATELY.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.800
CHIEF, UM...

13:57.833 --> 13:59.733
SHE'S NOT
A SURGICAL PATIENT ANYMORE,

13:59.767 --> 14:01.633
AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET BACK
TO THE O.R.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.500
SO, UH, DO YOU THINK I COULD
HAND HER OFF TO SOMEONE ELSE?

14:04.533 --> 14:08.067
O'MALLEY, ALZHEIMER'S CAUSES
HER REALITY TO SHIFT,

14:08.067 --> 14:09.800
DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION,
HER MOOD.

14:09.833 --> 14:11.067
SHE NEEDS STABILITY RIGHT NOW.

14:11.100 --> 14:15.133
THAT'S WHY I'M DEPENDING ON YOU
TO KEEP A SPECIAL EYE ON HER.

14:15.167 --> 14:18.433
YES, I KNOW, SIR,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

14:18.467 --> 14:20.367
IT DOESN'T
SEEM FAIR TO ME.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.600
I NEED THOSE STUDIES
YESTERDAY.

14:22.633 --> 14:25.267
YOU HEARD THE DOCTOR.

14:25.300 --> 14:28.333
GET MOVIN'.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.267
I SAW THAT.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.800
I SAW YOU TAKE THAT PILL.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.667
OH, IT'S--IT'S MY PILL.
YOU KNOW, "THE PILL."

14:39.700 --> 14:41.600
IT'S, UH,
IT'S NOT IN YOUR CHART,

14:41.633 --> 14:44.300
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL US
ALL THE MEDS YOU'RE ON.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.667
YOU'RE NOT MY DOCTOR.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.600
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.
SHE'S RIGHT.

14:47.633 --> 14:50.400
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
I SAW HER TAKE
UNAUTHORIZED MEDICATION.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.600
I'M ON THE PILL,

14:51.633 --> 14:53.533
AND I HAD GRAPEFRUIT JUICE
THIS MORNING.

14:53.567 --> 14:55.167
SINCE THE JUICE
INHIBITS ENZYMES

14:55.200 --> 14:57.100
INVOLVED IN THE METABOLISM
OF O.C.P.s,

14:57.133 --> 14:59.067
I THOUGHT
I'D AVOID THE INTERACTION

14:59.067 --> 15:00.800
BY TAKING IT TWO HOURS
AFTER MY MEAL.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.067
SHE IS A DOCTOR
IN NEUROPHARMACOLOGY, CRISTINA.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.533
WELL, IZZIE, I DON'T SEE
ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES...
GUYS.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.667
OKAY, WELL NOW YOU WILL.
WOULD YOU JUST GO BACK TO BED...

15:06.700 --> 15:08.667
(Both talking over each other)

15:08.700 --> 15:10.700
WOULD YOU JUST GO BACK TO BED
AND STOP POACHING MY PATIENTS?

15:10.733 --> 15:12.400
IT'S NOT A--

15:12.433 --> 15:14.400
(beeping)

15:14.433 --> 15:16.500
SHE'S IN V-FIB.
CALL THE CODE.

15:18.300 --> 15:19.267
(Man) CODE BLUE,
FOURTH FLOOR.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.833
(gasps)

15:20.867 --> 15:23.133
CODE BLUE.
(gasps, coughs)

15:25.867 --> 15:27.767
NO CODE?
NOT ANYMORE.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.700
CAN YOU HELP US GET HER BACK
IN THE BED?

15:29.733 --> 15:31.633
I'LL HELP.
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.700
(Izzie) WOULD YOU JUST GO BACK
TO BED, PLEASE? SERIOUSLY, GO.

15:33.733 --> 15:36.567
OH, GOD, YOU KNOW, IZZIE,
IF SHE'S ON O.C.P.s,

15:36.600 --> 15:39.167
THEN WE MARK IT DOWN, OKAY?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
YEAH.

15:45.533 --> 15:47.400
JEREMIAH'S GOT A MASS
IN HIS MID-EPIGASTRIUM,

15:47.433 --> 15:49.833
A DIFFUSED ENLARGEMENT
OF THE PANCREAS.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.367
THAT, WITH
HIS HYPOGLYCEMIC SEIZURES...

15:52.400 --> 15:54.467
HE'S GOING TO NEED
AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY...

15:54.500 --> 15:56.667
BUT DESPITE HIS TRIATHLONS,

15:56.700 --> 15:59.300
HIS LUNGS STILL
MAKE ME HESITANT TO CUT.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.500
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

16:01.533 --> 16:03.433
I DON'T KNOW.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.600
DOCTORS.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.533
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.500
HOW OLD IS HE?
HE'S 26.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.433
SURVIVOR, HUH?
AND THEN SOME.

16:11.467 --> 16:13.400
MY PATIENT
FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.167
I'M NOT
GOING TO LOSE HIM NOW.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.100
YOU PLANNING A LAPAROTOMY?

16:17.133 --> 16:18.433
YEAH, BUT HIS LUNGS...
MM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:18.467 --> 16:20.367
I THINK
I COULD HELP YOU WITH THIS.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.833
I'VE SEEN ONE CASE LIKE THIS
BEFORE IN A 9-YEAR-OLD.

16:22.867 --> 16:25.100
WE ENDED UP HAVING
TO DO A TOTAL PANCREATECTOMY.

16:25.133 --> 16:27.700
I'D BE HONORED TO TAKE ANY HELP
YOU COULD GIVE ME.

16:27.733 --> 16:34.300
YOU'RE A NEONATAL SPECIALIST.
WHAT--I--THIS ISN'T YOUR AREA.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.100
I'M JUST SAYING. I--

16:36.133 --> 16:38.067
I DID TWO YEARS GENETICS
RESEARCH IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS.

16:38.067 --> 16:40.367
I'VE PRETTY MUCH SEEN IT ALL,
DR. GREY.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.667
OH.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.600
JUST BECAUSE SHE OFFERED
HER SERVICES,

16:45.633 --> 16:47.533
DOESN'T MEAN
SHE INTENDS TO STAY.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.467
WELL WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME...

16:49.500 --> 16:50.633
IT MEANS THAT
SHE'S A GOOD DOCTOR.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.400
OH HO HO. WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY
DEFENDING HER?

16:53.433 --> 16:56.067
I'M NOT. MEREDITH, SHE GAVE ME
DIVORCE PAPERS

16:56.100 --> 16:57.400
WHICH SHE FILED.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.433
OH. WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

17:00.467 --> 17:04.200
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SIGN,
AND I'M FREE.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.133
WE'RE FREE.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.167
IS THERE ANYTHING
TO THINK ABOUT?

17:08.200 --> 17:11.700
NO, OF COURSE NOT. I HAVE
TO READ THROUGH THEM, SIGN,

17:11.733 --> 17:13.667
AND THEN ADDISON'S ON THE NEXT
PLANE OUT OF HERE.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.400
YOU SAY HE GOT SHOT
IN THE HEAD?

17:17.433 --> 17:20.633
HE SAYS HE GOT SHOT IN THE HEAD.
I SAY HE'S A MENTAL DEFECT.

17:20.667 --> 17:22.567
UM, HI.
MA'AM, YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.733
YEAH, I KNOW. I'M LOOKING FOR
SAMUEL LINDEN. HE...

17:28.100 --> 17:31.100
OH, MY GOD. SAMUEL.
WELL, HOW--HOW--

17:31.133 --> 17:32.733
HOW--HOW BAD IS IT?
ARE YOU HIS WIFE?

17:32.767 --> 17:34.567
YES, FOR 21 YEARS.
JUST TELL ME HOW HE IS.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.667
FINE, FOR A MAN WHO SAYS
HE SHOT HIMSELF.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.567
HE SHOT HIMSELF.
HE WAS CLEANING HIS GUN.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.500
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

17:43.533 --> 17:45.567
WE'LL KNOW EVERYTHING
WHEN WE FINISH HIS C.T.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.367
THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA,
MA'AM. YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.400
NO, NO. MY HUSBAND
HAS A BULLET IN HIS HEAD.

17:49.433 --> 17:51.200
THEN WE'LL FIND IT.
IF YOU COULD JUST WAIT OUTSIDE,

17:51.233 --> 17:54.200
I'LL BE WITH YOU AS SOON
AS WE KNOW SOMETHING. I PROMISE.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.167
UNH.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.533
OF ALL THE FINE DOCTORS IN THIS
CITY, YOU ACCEPT A CONSULT

18:01.567 --> 18:04.233
FROM ADDISON SHEPHERD?
MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD, ISN'T IT?

18:04.267 --> 18:06.567
THE POINT IS THAT SHE SHOULD BE
ON HER WAY HOME.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.533
YOU'RE TRYIN' TO DRIVE ME
CRAZY, AREN'T YOU?

18:10.233 --> 18:11.800
(bell ringing)

18:11.833 --> 18:15.267
OH, HEY, NOW, DON'T DO THIS.
DO YOU THINK THIS HAS
SOMETHIN' TO DO WITH YOU?

18:15.300 --> 18:17.200
DO YOU THINK
I'M EVEN THINKING ABOUT YOU

18:17.233 --> 18:19.367
AND YOUR ROMANTIC PROBLEMS?

18:19.400 --> 18:22.367
I'M TRYIN' TO HELP A PATIENT
VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART,

18:22.400 --> 18:25.267
AND IF CONSULTIN' WITH YOUR
WIFE, YOUR EX, YOUR MISTRESS,

18:25.300 --> 18:27.600
WHATEVER IT IS THAT SHE BECOMES,
IF THAT'S THE THING

18:27.633 --> 18:30.233
I HAVE TO DO TO SAVE MY PATIENT,
THEN I'M DAMN WELL GONNA DO IT.

18:30.267 --> 18:32.167
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.433
I DESERVE THAT.
IT'S--COME ON, IT'S JUST...

18:34.467 --> 18:38.567
LOOK, YOU HAVE PUT YOURSELF
BETWEEN TWO VERY FINE WOMEN

18:38.600 --> 18:40.500
AND YOU LOOKIN'
FOR AN EASY WAY OUT.

18:40.533 --> 18:43.133
YOU WANT TO USE ME
AND THE HOSPITAL--

18:43.167 --> 18:45.333
SOMEBODY TO MAKE THE DECISION
FOR YOU,

18:45.367 --> 18:47.700
AND IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

18:47.733 --> 18:50.300
(beeping stops)
COULD I JUST--

18:50.333 --> 18:52.600
COULD I JUST SAY
A COUPLE THINGS?
JUST--DEH, DEH, DEH.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.467
YOU SCARED US
A LITTLE THERE.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.400
HOW'S HER WORKUP COMING?

19:03.433 --> 19:05.333
UH, ELECTROLYTES ARE WITHIN
NORMAL LIMITS,

19:05.367 --> 19:07.267
URINE TOX WAS NEGATIVE
AND E.K.G.'s FINE.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.200
TILT TEST IS SCHEDULED
FOR NOON.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.133
OH, AND SHE'S
ON CONTRACEPTIVES.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.067
SO?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.833
THAT OTHER DOCTOR
MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL OF IT.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.767
WELL,
SHE DIDN'T TELL US BEFORE.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.667
SO I DOCUMENTED IT
IN HER MED LIST.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.533
WHAT OTHER DOCTOR?
CRISTINA.

19:20.567 --> 19:23.400
SHE WAS WANDERING
THE HALLS.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.367
FINE. TAKE HER DOWN
FOR AN ECHO.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.133
AN ECHO? WHAT ABOUT
CARDIOVERSION OR ABLATION?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.700
WON'T I NEED A PACEMAKER

19:29.733 --> 19:32.200
OR A PERMANENT
INTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR?

19:32.233 --> 19:34.133
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE UNUSUAL
FOR RHEUMATIC HEART DISEASE

19:34.167 --> 19:37.067
TO CAUSE VENTRICULAR
DYSRHYTHMIAS,

19:37.067 --> 19:38.767
WE'VE STILL GOT TO
CHECK YOUR VALVES.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.367
I THOUGHT YOUR DOCTORATE
WAS IN NEUROPHARMACOLOGY,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.267
NOT MEDICINE.
IT IS.

19:52.367 --> 19:55.700
ADDISON GAVE DEREK
DIVORCE PAPERS, WHICH IS GOOD.

19:55.733 --> 19:57.700
I MEAN, SHE'S STILL HERE
BEING ADDISON,

19:57.733 --> 19:59.633
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I'M JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.833
THAT'S ODD.
IT'S ODD THAT
I'M NOT JEALOUS?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.767
NO, YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BE JEALOUS.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.700
IT'S YOUR TERRITORY, AND SHE'S
PEEING ALL OVER IT.

20:05.733 --> 20:07.500
WHAT'S ODD
IS BURKE'S PATIENT.

20:07.533 --> 20:09.433
SHE'S BEEN IN FOUR
OTHER HOSPITALS THIS YEAR.

20:09.467 --> 20:10.800
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

20:10.833 --> 20:13.067
YOU SEEM AWFULLY INTERESTED
IN BURKE'S PATIENT.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.400
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH BURKE.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.333
CRISTINA, YOU LOST
A FALLOPIAN TUBE, A BABY

20:16.367 --> 20:17.767
AND A BOYFRIEND
ALL IN ONE DAY.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.433
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO BE UPSET.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.367
AND YOU'RE LOSING McDREAMY
TO HIS PERFECT WIFE.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.733
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE JEALOUS.
I DID NOT LOSE McDREAMY.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.733
DIVORCE PAPERS, REMEMBER?
AND I'M NOT JEALOUS.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.667
AND I'M NOT UPSET.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.133
YOU REALLY SHOULD BE
IN YOUR ROOM.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.033
OKAY, IF THE SITUATION
WAS REVERSED,

20:31.067 --> 20:32.800
WOULD YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME

20:32.833 --> 20:36.367
WITH YOUR MOTHER IN A CONFINED
ROOM WITH ONE WINDOW?

20:36.400 --> 20:40.100
DO YOU THINK WE'RE LIKE THEM,
OUR MOTHERS?

20:44.200 --> 20:46.433
(Woman) DR. JAMES...

20:46.467 --> 20:49.433
UH, WHERE'S YOUR MOM?
EXACTLY.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.233
WHERE IS MY MOTHER?
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

20:52.267 --> 20:54.267
FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.067
OH, CRAP.

20:56.100 --> 21:00.633
OH, MAN, YOU ARE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.733
(Alex) NO. IT CAN'T BE.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.800
THE GUY WAS READIN'
A FREAKIN' MAGAZINE.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.067
IT'S DEFINITELY A BULLET,

21:07.100 --> 21:08.833
ONE THAT TRACKED
CLEAR THROUGH HIS HEAD.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.767
NOW ARE YOU PEOPLE
JUST GOING TO SIT HERE,

21:10.800 --> 21:13.267
OR ARE YOU GOING TO GET HIM
INTO SURGERY?

21:17.233 --> 21:19.633
HERE'S THE MISSILE TRACK.
AS YOU CAN SEE,

21:19.667 --> 21:21.567
IT DOESN'T EVEN CROSS
THE MIDLINE. HE'S LUCKY.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.433
THIS GUY MAY HAVE EVEN BEEN
SITTING THERE TALKING TO YOU.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.233
HE'LL NEED DEBRIDEMENT
OF THE ENTRANCE WOUND

21:26.267 --> 21:27.567
AND REPAIR THE DURA,

21:27.600 --> 21:29.533
BUT WE DON'T NEED
TO REMOVE THE BULLET.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.533
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT DIAGNOSIS,
DR. GREY.

21:31.567 --> 21:34.467
I'M DR. SHEPHERD.
I'M YOUR NEURO CONSULT.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.700
DR. GREY...

21:35.733 --> 21:38.133
THEY NEED YOU UPSTAIRS.

21:38.167 --> 21:41.767
YOU'LL BOOK THE O.R. AND STAT?
I'M ON IT.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.733
UNBELIEVABLE.

21:46.767 --> 21:48.733
O'MALLEY.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.567
CAN YOU NOT HANDLE THIS,
DOCTOR?

21:52.667 --> 21:57.167
I CAN'T HANDLE
A LOT OF THINGS.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.333
WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE
UNTIL WE GO IN THERE,

21:59.367 --> 22:02.200
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE OUT YOUR PANCREAS

22:02.233 --> 22:04.133
AND REROUTE YOUR INTESTINES.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.833
DID YOU TELL HER THAT MY LUNGS
DON'T DO WELL WITH ANESTHESIA?

22:06.867 --> 22:10.533
DON'T I ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK?
YOUR KIDNEY FUNCTION
IS DECREASING RAPIDLY,

22:10.567 --> 22:13.200
AND I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA GO
INTO MULTISYSTEM ORGAN FAILURE

22:13.233 --> 22:15.700
IF WE DON'T OPERATE.
IF I SAY NO?

22:15.733 --> 22:18.067
(Miranda) THERE'S NO GUARANTEES,
JEREMIAH. YOU KNOW THAT.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.067
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,
HARD SURGERY

22:20.067 --> 22:21.800
AND PUT A LOT OF STRESS
ON YOUR BODY.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.800
YEAH, BUT I'M ME.

22:23.833 --> 22:26.167
BUT YOU'RE YOU.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.633
SO IF WE DON'T OPERATE,
I DIE,

22:29.667 --> 22:33.733
AND IF WE DO OPERATE,
I MAY DIE.

22:33.767 --> 22:35.667
BASICALLY, YES.

22:35.700 --> 22:38.400
WELL, I LIKE THOSE ODDS.

22:38.433 --> 22:41.067
AND 26 YEARS WITH THIS DISEASE
IS AWESOME,

22:41.100 --> 22:42.467
AND THAT'S THE REALITY.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.300
SO IF I GET LUCKY...
GREAT,

22:45.333 --> 22:48.200
AND IF I DON'T...

22:54.400 --> 22:56.567
IT'S BEEN SWEET.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.700
IT'S GOING TO STAY SWEET.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.567
YOU UNDERSTAND, WE'LL NEED
TO DO A PSYCH EVALUATION?

23:03.600 --> 23:05.200
HOW MANY TIMES
DO WE HAVE TO TELL YOU?

23:05.233 --> 23:06.467
HE WASN'T TRYING
TO KILL HIMSELF.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.333
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO DO THEIR JOB, HON.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.267
WELL, NO. THEIR JOB
IS TO MAKE YOU BETTER.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.800
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN
THE GUN WENT OFF?

23:12.833 --> 23:14.167
I WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM,

23:14.200 --> 23:17.300
AND I HEARD THE SHOT
AND IT WAS AWFUL.

23:17.333 --> 23:19.633
MM-HMM. SQUEEZE THIS.
IT'S OVER NOW.

23:19.667 --> 23:21.567
(Alex) WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL 9-1-1?

23:21.600 --> 23:24.533
'CAUSE HE WAS ONLY UNCONSCIOUS
FOR A MOMENT, AND THEN--

23:24.567 --> 23:27.367
THEN HE WAS--HE WAS WALKING
AND TALKING AND...

23:27.400 --> 23:29.433
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE
A REPORT TO THE POLICE.
THE POLICE?

23:29.467 --> 23:31.800
WHAT--WHAT DO WE NEED TO TALK
TO THE POLICE ABOUT?

23:31.833 --> 23:34.500
WE HAVE TO REPORT ANY
GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO THE POLICE.

23:34.533 --> 23:36.067
IT'S THE LAW.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.200
IT'LL BE OKAY.

23:43.567 --> 23:45.567
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A.W.O.L.,
YOU KNOW.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.267
I'M WORKING,
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

23:48.300 --> 23:50.200
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE CRAZY WOMAN IN FOUR.

23:50.233 --> 23:52.833
YOU ARE THE CRAZY WOMAN
ON FOUR.
I MADE A BREAK FOR FREEDOM.

23:52.867 --> 23:55.200
WILL YOU HAND ME
THAT DICTIONARY?

23:55.233 --> 23:58.133
UNH. YOU HAVE A BETTER
PATIENT THAN ME,

23:58.167 --> 23:59.733
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A PATIENT.

23:59.767 --> 24:02.400
MEREDITH'S GOT A C.F. CASE,
ALEX HAS GOT

24:02.433 --> 24:04.067
THE GUNSHOT WOUND, IZZIE'S GOT
THE MYSTERY ARRHYTHMIAS.

24:04.100 --> 24:08.367
I'M NOT A NANNY.
I'M A SURGEON, A CUTTER.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.067
BUT, NO.
I'M GETTIN' FAKE LABS

24:11.067 --> 24:14.767
FOR FAKE PATIENTS SO SHE CAN
DO A FAKE SURGERY.

24:16.433 --> 24:18.333
SHE'S FAKING IT.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.833
IT'S REAL TO HER.
IT'S ALZHEIMER'S.

24:20.867 --> 24:23.500
THE MISSIONARY. KALPANA.

24:23.533 --> 24:26.667
OH. GOD. OH.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.267
THANK YOU.
OW.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.133
UNCALLED FOR.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.467
HEY, IZZIE, HOW HAVE
HER STUDIES BEEN?

24:34.500 --> 24:36.800
HEY, I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
FOR THAT EVERYWHERE.
NEGATIVE, RIGHT?

24:36.833 --> 24:39.467
OH, THE ECHO TESTS SHOWED
MILD MITRAL STENOSIS.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.400
THE TILT TEST WAS NEGATIVE.
WE'RE DOING E.P. STUDIES.

24:41.433 --> 24:43.300
I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER

24:43.333 --> 24:45.233
WITHOUT STICKING ELECTRODES
IN HER HEART.

24:45.267 --> 24:47.167
REALLY? JUST BY THE CHART.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.100
NO, FROM THE PILL SHE TOOK.

24:49.133 --> 24:50.633
THEY WERE CONTRACEPTIVES,
CRISTINA.

24:50.667 --> 24:52.733
WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED
WITH THIS? JUST GO BACK TO BED.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.400
I THINK SHE'S DOING THIS
TO HERSELF.
YOU THINK SHE'S INDUCING

24:55.433 --> 24:57.500
VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS? SHE'D
HAVE TO BE CRAZY TO DO THAT.

24:57.533 --> 25:00.300
NO, NO, NO, NO. SHE'D HAVE TO
HAVE MUNCHAUSEN'S.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.300
OKAY, WAIT. YOU THINK SHE'S
SECRETLY INGESTING SOMETHING

25:02.333 --> 25:04.267
TO PRODUCE REAL SYMPTOMS?
SERIOUSLY?

25:04.300 --> 25:07.133
YEP. JUST RUN IT BY BURKE
AND TELL ME WHAT HE THINKS.
TELL HIM YOURSELF.

25:07.167 --> 25:10.833
HE'S STANDIN' RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
DR. BURKE.

25:10.867 --> 25:14.633
(sighs)

25:18.600 --> 25:20.500
(sighs)
WHERE ARE WE?

25:20.533 --> 25:25.133
O.R. 2 IN 30 MINUTES. HE'S
PREPPED. TRANSPO'S ON THE WAY.

25:25.167 --> 25:27.067
21 YEARS.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.500
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
(Samuel) HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY I'M SORRY?

25:29.533 --> 25:31.700
I LOVE YOU, OKAY?
I FORGIVE YOU.

25:31.733 --> 25:34.700
YOU CHEATED ON ME.
YOU CHEATED ON ME,

25:34.733 --> 25:36.633
AND YOU DO NOT GET TO PLAY
THE MARTYR HERE.

25:36.667 --> 25:39.167
I GOT A BULLET IN MY HEAD.
AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE US EVEN.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.400
YOU SHOT ME.
I THINK WE NEED TO GET
THE POLICE UP HERE RIGHT NOW.

25:43.433 --> 25:45.500
I MEAN, SHE OBVIOUSLY LOVES
THE PATIENT ROLE.

25:45.533 --> 25:47.267
I MEAN, SHE PRACTICALLY LIVES
IN HOSPITALS.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.667
AND--AND WE'RE LIKE
AN IMAGINARY FAMILY TO HER

25:49.700 --> 25:51.600
BECAUSE HER REAL FAMILY
BLOWS HER OFF

25:51.633 --> 25:53.600
TO GO TAKE CARE
OF OTHER PEOPLE,

25:53.633 --> 25:55.133
AND I SAW HER
TAKE SOMETHING.

25:55.167 --> 25:56.533
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.567
WE HAVE TO RULE OUT EVERYTHING
ELSE, EVERYTHING PHYSICAL.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.633
SHE EVEN LIED ABOUT HER JOB.
SHE'S A PHARMACY TECH,

26:00.667 --> 26:04.400
NOT A PhD.
SO SHE'S A LIAR.
I'VE BEEN LIED TO BEFORE.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.233
HEY, WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT US HERE.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.267
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE.
I DIDN'T LIE.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.400
YOU WITHHELD THE TRUTH.
HOW DO I KNOW--
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:12.433 --> 26:14.300
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER YOU
BREAKING THINGS OFF WITH ME,

26:14.333 --> 26:16.233
AND YOU DIDN'T
SEEM SO UPSET ABOUT IT.

26:16.267 --> 26:18.533
OKAY, THIS--THIS IS NOT--
THIS IS NOT A RELATIONSHIP.

26:18.567 --> 26:20.433
THIS IS NOT REAL.
CRISTINA.

26:20.467 --> 26:23.267
OKAY, AND--AND SO WHAT'S
WITH THE BIG, FAKE DISPLAY

26:23.300 --> 26:25.667
OF HURT AND DRAMA?

26:25.700 --> 26:27.600
CRISTINA.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE IN BED.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.467
CRISTINA.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.567
OFFICERS,
THANKS FOR COMING.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.567
MA'AM, WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT?

26:48.600 --> 26:50.500
WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

26:50.533 --> 26:51.700
OH, UM, OF COURSE.

26:51.733 --> 26:53.633
WELL, NOTHING LIKE
A DOMESTIC DISPUTE

26:53.667 --> 26:55.667
TO LIVEN UP
A PRE-OP, HUH?

26:58.533 --> 27:00.433
(Jeremiah)
WHERE DO I SIGN?

27:00.467 --> 27:02.833
HERE FOR CONSENT...

27:02.867 --> 27:06.567
AND HERE FOR D.N.R.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.267
AND NO EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES.

27:09.300 --> 27:12.800
GOOD. OKAY, LIFT UP FOR ME.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.767
OW. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
CALL MY PARENTS.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.167
CALL 'EM YOURSELF
WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF HERE.

27:28.733 --> 27:31.333
DR. GREY, I HAVE THOSE LABS...

27:31.367 --> 27:33.367
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.267
YOU LOST HER AGAIN?
AGAIN?

27:36.300 --> 27:39.300
I AM A SURGEON.
A SURGEON.

27:39.333 --> 27:42.100
YEAH, WELL, YOU WON'T BE
WHEN DR. WEBBER FINDS OUT

27:42.133 --> 27:45.667
YOU LOST ELLIS GREY AGAIN.
(laughs)

27:45.700 --> 27:49.267
WE'RE USING THREE DIFFERENT
CATHETERS.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.200
WHY ARE WE DOIN' THAT,
DR. STEVENS?

27:51.233 --> 27:53.133
PROGRAMMED ELECTRICAL
STIMULATION

27:53.167 --> 27:55.067
MAPS THE HEART'S
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM

27:55.100 --> 27:57.100
TO FIND THE FOCUS
OF THE IRREGULAR--
UM, DOCTORS?

27:57.133 --> 27:59.367
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
YES.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.300
HER URINE'S BLUE.

28:01.333 --> 28:03.067
WHAT?

28:05.767 --> 28:07.833
WHY IS HER URINE BLUE?

28:07.867 --> 28:09.833
(sighs)

28:09.867 --> 28:12.633
SHE SAYS SHE HAS A SURGERY
SCHEDULED WITH DR. SHEPHERD.

28:12.667 --> 28:13.467
I TURNED MY BACK
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.533
WHY DID YOU
TURN YOUR BACK AT ALL?

28:15.567 --> 28:17.500
I TOLD YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

28:20.067 --> 28:21.800
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.300
YOU WANT TO FIND A HOT SURGERY,
THEN FIND ONE.

28:24.333 --> 28:28.300
YOU'RE FREE.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

28:35.767 --> 28:37.467
THIS IS ONE SICK BASTARD.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.733
SHOULD FLIP HIM OVER
AND GIVE HIM A SPINE.

28:38.767 --> 28:41.233
PULL BACK ON THE RETRACTOR,
DR. KAREV.

28:41.267 --> 28:42.200
A LITTLE SUCTION?

28:42.233 --> 28:44.467
COVERING FOR HIS WIFE
AFTER SHE SHOT HIM.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.333
HE DID CHEAT ON HER.
YEAH, AND THAT GUILT'S WORTH
A BULLET IN THE HEAD?

28:47.367 --> 28:50.667
RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILT
ON SACRIFICE.

28:50.700 --> 28:53.067
NOT THAT KIND OF SACRIFICE.
MM, I DON'T KNOW.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.100
SOMETIMES,
THE BULLET'S WORTH IT.

29:04.567 --> 29:07.433
OH, RICHARD.

29:07.467 --> 29:10.733
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER GET HERE.
LOOK, THE O.R.'s EMPTY.

29:10.767 --> 29:13.567
I HAVE A LITTLE TIME
BEFORE MY SURGERY.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.667
I DON'T THINK
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.200
NO.

29:32.233 --> 29:35.333
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

29:35.367 --> 29:39.067
COME ON. I'LL TAKE YOU BACK
TO YOUR ROOM.

29:52.867 --> 29:55.267
I NEED MORE TRACTION,
DR. GREY.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.300
HERE. GIVE ME
SOME SUCTION THERE.

29:59.433 --> 30:01.333
NOW, GREY,
RETRACT THE DUODENUM.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.767
GOOD. HOW'S HE DOIN'?

30:02.800 --> 30:03.967
HARDER TO VENTILATE.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.667
NO URINE OUTPUT
SINCE WE STARTED.
HE'S SHUTTING DOWN.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.300
DID YOU INCREASE
HIS PEAK PRESSURES?

30:08.333 --> 30:09.633
ANY HIGHER,
IT'LL BLOW HIS LUNGS.

30:09.667 --> 30:13.600
(beeping)
BRADYCARDIA.
PUSHING 1 OF ATROPINE.

30:13.633 --> 30:15.533
(Addison)
TRY VENTILATING HIM MANUALLY.

30:15.567 --> 30:18.333
SEE IF HE STARTS COMING
BACK UP.

30:18.367 --> 30:20.833
DID WE MISS ANY BLEEDERS?
THE SURGICAL FIELD
IS CLEAR.

30:20.867 --> 30:22.267
AGONAL RHYTHM.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.700
ANY PULSE WITH THAT?
(Woman) NO CAROTID.

30:24.733 --> 30:26.833
OKAY, STARTING C.P.R.
PUSH 1 OF EPI.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.600
NO EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES,
DR. BAILEY. HE'S D.N.R.

30:29.633 --> 30:32.333
THIS IS JUST GOOD MEDICINE.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.300
BLUE URINE?
A SECOND DRUG SCREEN

30:37.333 --> 30:39.400
WAS POSITIVE
FOR AMITRIPTYLINE.

30:39.433 --> 30:43.067
WHICH, I'M SURE YOU KNOW,
CAUSES VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIAS.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.100
YOU KNEW IT WOULDN'T SHOW UP
ON A ROUTINE DRUG SCREEN,

30:45.133 --> 30:46.733
BUT I'M GUESSING
YOU DIDN'T REALIZE

30:46.767 --> 30:49.200
IT WOULD TURN
YOUR URINE BLUE.
I DIDN'T DO THIS TO MYSELF.

30:49.233 --> 30:51.167
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
I'M SICK.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.100
I'M SICK.
I HAVE SOMETHING--

30:53.133 --> 30:55.733
NO. YOU'RE JUST
DECEIVING YOURSELF...

30:55.767 --> 30:58.367
MANUFACTURING THINGS
THAT REALLY AREN'T THERE,

30:58.400 --> 31:00.500
SEEING ONLY
WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE...

31:00.533 --> 31:02.433
WASTING OUR TIME,
OUR RESOURCES

31:02.467 --> 31:04.767
AND THROWIN' AWAY
YOUR OWN LIFE.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.267
YOUR ILLNESS IS IN YOUR HEAD,
KALPANA.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.200
WE WILL BE TRANSFERRING YOU
TO PSYCH.

31:09.233 --> 31:11.167
(beeping)

31:13.533 --> 31:14.600
COME ON.

31:16.633 --> 31:18.567
COME ON, DON'T GIVE UP.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.367
COME ON.
YOU'RE GETTING TIRED.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.667
LET ME TAKE OVER, DR. BAILEY.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.567
(Addison) DR. BAILEY,
HIS INTESTINES ARE CYANOTIC.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.500
THERE IS NO BLOOD
CIRCULATING.

31:34.533 --> 31:37.067
IT'S BEING SHUNTED TO HIS BRAIN
WHERE HE NEEDS IT.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.833
YOU CALL THOSE COMPRESSIONS?

31:38.867 --> 31:41.067
1, 2, 3...

31:41.867 --> 31:44.133
(monitor beeping loudly)

31:44.167 --> 31:46.267
FIGHT IT.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.067
COME ON.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.733
WHY ISN'T ANYONE MOVING?

31:54.767 --> 31:55.967
WHO'S RECORDING?

31:56.067 --> 31:59.567
IT'S BEEN TEN MINUTES SINCE
WE'VE HAD A PERFUSING RHYTHM.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.100
IT'S YOUR CALL, DR. BAILEY.

32:01.133 --> 32:04.567
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.600
ASYSTOLE.

32:21.633 --> 32:23.567
(beeping stops)

32:25.467 --> 32:27.567
TIME OF DEATH--19:26.

33:21.367 --> 33:26.300
(sighs) IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT
THE END WHEN YOU'RE TOO CLOSE.

33:36.533 --> 33:42.367
LOOK, I DON'T WANT SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T WANT ME, MEREDITH,

33:42.400 --> 33:45.700
BUT IF THERE'S THE SLIGHTEST
CHANCE THAT HE DOES...

33:45.733 --> 33:47.700
I'M NOT LEAVING SEATTLE.

33:54.367 --> 33:55.267
WHAT'D SHE TELL 'EM?

33:55.300 --> 33:57.333
THAT YOU CHEATED ON HER,
THAT SHE WAS DRUNK,

33:57.367 --> 33:59.267
YOU WERE CLEANING YOUR GUNS
IN THE KITCHEN.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.233
I'M NOT GONNA PRESS CHARGES.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:01.267 --> 34:04.100
SHE CONFESSED.
ASSAULT IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

34:04.133 --> 34:07.733
THEY ARRESTED HER?
MAN, YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.

34:07.767 --> 34:10.800
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?
I'M STUPID.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.733
NOTHIN' WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL
MORE STUPID THAN CHEATING

34:12.767 --> 34:15.067
ON THE WOMAN YOU LOVE.

34:15.067 --> 34:17.467
YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSIN'.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.133
YOUR LATTE IS BY YOUR BED,

34:29.167 --> 34:32.800
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S COLD.

34:32.833 --> 34:35.200
(sighs) I DON'T NEED IT.

34:35.233 --> 34:36.567
YOU SHOULD BE IN BED.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.100
STOP IT. I'M FINE, OKAY?

34:38.133 --> 34:40.600
MY BRAIN IS FINE,
MY BODY'S FINE, I'M FINE.

34:40.633 --> 34:42.767
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME.
THEN WHY DID YOU?

34:42.800 --> 34:44.600
YOU KNOW, I'M--
YOU KNOW, JUST STOP IT.

34:44.633 --> 34:46.533
I DON'T--I'M SORRY
I'M NOT THAT PERSON.

34:46.567 --> 34:50.833
I'M SORRY I DON'T--I DON'T
NEED YOU HERE TAKING CARE OF ME.

34:50.867 --> 34:52.767
WELL?
YOU WERE RIGHT.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.167
KALPANA DEFINITELY SUFFERS
FROM MUNCHAUSEN'S.

34:55.200 --> 34:58.167
SEE? I WAS RIGHT.

34:58.200 --> 35:00.067
I WAS RIGHT.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.767
I WAS RIGHT.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.233
(crying) I WAS RIGHT.
I WAS...

35:08.267 --> 35:10.233
RIGHT. I WAS RIGHT.

35:10.267 --> 35:14.067
OH, I WAS--I WAS...

35:15.367 --> 35:19.733
I WAS RIGHT. I WAS...

35:19.767 --> 35:22.533
I'M RIGHT. I'M...

35:25.367 --> 35:27.233
YOU TOOK
THE CLINICAL SKILLS SECTION

35:27.267 --> 35:29.167
OF YOUR MEDICAL BOARD EXAMS
AFTER MOST INTERNS.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.233
SO THE RESULTS ARE ONLY NOW
COMING OUT.

35:31.267 --> 35:35.200
I GOT A CALL FROM U.S.M.L.E.
THIS MORNING.

35:38.333 --> 35:42.267
OH. SO YOU'RE--
YOU'RE SAYING...

35:42.300 --> 35:44.067
KAREV, YOU'RE STILL AN M.D.

35:44.067 --> 35:46.567
YOU STILL GET
TO PRACTICE MEDICINE.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.500
THE HOSPITAL GRANTS YOU FOUR
MONTHS TO RETAKE THE EXAM.

35:48.533 --> 35:51.433
YOU STUDY IT, YOU PASS IT,
YOU PUT IT BEHIND YOU.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.367
ONE MISSTEP DOESN'T AFFECT
YOUR CAREER.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.433
YEAH. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
THANKS. THANKS.

35:55.467 --> 35:59.100
WHAT HAPPENS, UH,
IF I--IF I TAKE THE EXAM

35:59.133 --> 36:01.133
FOR A SECOND TIME
AND I DON'T PASS?

36:01.167 --> 36:04.100
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE A SURGICAL
RESIDENT AT SEATTLE GRACE.

36:04.133 --> 36:06.167
FAILING AGAIN
IS NOT AN OPTION.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.833
(sighs)

36:35.867 --> 36:39.133
(crying)

36:39.167 --> 36:40.233
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:40.267 --> 36:44.133
I CAN'T STOP. I CAN'T.
I CAN'T STOP.

36:44.167 --> 36:46.100
CRYING.
SHE CAN'T STOP CRYING.

36:46.133 --> 36:47.733
I CAN SEE THAT.
WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO TO HER?

36:47.767 --> 36:50.700
NOTHING.
SHE'S GOING TO DEHYDRATE.

36:50.733 --> 36:52.567
CRISTINA, DO YOU WANT
SOME WATER?

36:52.600 --> 36:56.133
NO. NO. NO.

36:56.167 --> 36:57.467
NO!
NO!

36:57.500 --> 37:00.567
I ALREADY TRIED THAT.
IT JUST MADE IT WORSE.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.533
I KNEW SHE'D BREAK SOONER
OR LATER. JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

37:03.567 --> 37:06.100
I WILL KILL HER!

37:06.133 --> 37:08.067
I AM HER MOTHER.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.833
WE DON'T DO WELL
WITH MOTHERS HERE.

37:09.867 --> 37:13.400
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE
AND COME BACK LATER?

37:14.833 --> 37:18.467
CRISTINA.
MAKE--MAKE IT STOP.
MAKE IT STOP.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.533
SOMEBODY SEDATE ME!

37:22.567 --> 37:24.067
(sobbing)

37:25.733 --> 37:29.133
SOMETIMES, REALITY
HAS A WAY OF SNEAKING UP

37:29.167 --> 37:31.767
AND BITING US IN THE ASS...

37:31.800 --> 37:35.267
AND WHEN THE DAM BURSTS,

37:35.300 --> 37:37.700
ALL YOU CAN DO IS SWIM.

37:41.467 --> 37:46.300
THE WORLD OF PRETEND
IS A CAGE, NOT A COCOON.

37:48.233 --> 37:52.333
WE CAN ONLY LIE TO OURSELVES
FOR SO LONG.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.300
WE ARE TIRED.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.667
WE ARE SCARED.

38:09.700 --> 38:12.200
DENYING IT
DOESN'T CHANGE THE TRUTH.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.833
HI. M-MRS. TATE?

38:25.867 --> 38:31.233
IT'S MIRANDA.
MIRANDA BAILEY.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.300
I'M CALLING ABOUT JEREMIAH.

38:38.200 --> 38:41.400
I'M SO SORRY.

38:41.433 --> 38:44.333
(elevator bell dings)

39:17.533 --> 39:20.267
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE TOUCHED.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.267
(crying)

39:30.800 --> 39:34.467
SHH, SHH...

39:34.500 --> 39:36.533
SHH.

39:36.567 --> 39:39.067
SHH.

39:43.667 --> 39:47.833
SOONER OR LATER, WE HAVE TO
PUT ASIDE OUR DENIAL

39:47.867 --> 39:54.700
AND FACE THE WORLD HEAD-ON,
GUNS BLAZING.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.600
HI.

40:00.633 --> 40:02.533
HI.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.300
THANKS.

40:04.333 --> 40:05.167
YEAH.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.633
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH, YOU READY TO GO?

40:07.667 --> 40:11.267
YEAH, ARE YOU--YOU JUST--
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE YOURSELF.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.167
NO. UH, LOOK, WE GOT
DINNER RESERVATIONS.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.233
WE SHOULD GO. SO, UH...

40:15.267 --> 40:17.600
LET'S GO.
OKAY.

40:17.633 --> 40:21.433
DENIAL--IT'S NOT JUST
A RIVER IN EGYPT.

40:21.467 --> 40:24.633
IT'S A FREAKING OCEAN.

40:24.667 --> 40:25.833
I'M GLAD
WE'RE DOING THIS.

40:25.867 --> 40:28.200
ME, TOO. WANT A DRINK?

40:28.233 --> 40:29.533
YES. OH.

40:29.567 --> 40:31.567
I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET IT.

40:40.067 --> 40:44.533
SO HOW DO YOU KEEP
FROM DROWNING IN IT?
