<i>Once there was a way</i>

00:49.085 --> 00:53.078
<i>Are the stars out tonight?</i>

00:53.256 --> 00:58.523
<i>Once there was a way to get back home</i>

00:58.695 --> 01:00.959
<i>I only have eyes</i>

01:01.137 --> 01:06.159
<i>Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry</i>

01:06.336 --> 01:08.668
<i>For you</i>

01:08.838 --> 01:11.432
<i>And I will sing a lullaby</i>

01:11.608 --> 01:14.543
<i>With a song in my heart</i>

01:15.044 --> 01:17.103
<i>So tell me</i>

01:17.280 --> 01:20.579
<i>Tell me something good</i>

01:22.919 --> 01:25.752
<i>Tell me that you love me</i>

01:25.922 --> 01:28.550
<i>Tell me, baby</i>

01:28.725 --> 01:31.125
<i>Tell me something good</i>

01:31.294 --> 01:33.023
<i>Only you</i>

01:33.196 --> 01:35.096
<i>But how can you know for sure?</i>

01:35.265 --> 01:38.200
<i>Can make this world seem right</i>

01:38.368 --> 01:39.926
<i>Is there really just one?</i>

01:40.103 --> 01:42.731
<i>I need your love</i>

01:43.139 --> 01:47.509
<i>So many songs, but I'm feeling so lonely.</i>

01:47.711 --> 01:51.477
<i>Where is the love?</i>

01:55.553 --> 01:59.990
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

02:00.157 --> 02:03.092
<i>To turn me on</i>

02:03.961 --> 02:07.328
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

02:07.498 --> 02:08.726
<i>Hello</i>

02:08.899 --> 02:12.164
<i>- From dusk till dawn</i>
<i>- Is it me you're looking for?</i>

02:12.336 --> 02:15.430
<i>You don't need experience</i>

02:15.606 --> 02:16.698
<i>Take</i>

02:16.874 --> 02:20.366
<i>- To turn me out</i>
<i>- These broken wings</i>

02:20.544 --> 02:23.638
<i>You just leave it all up to me</i>

02:23.814 --> 02:28.751
<i>Let's talk about eggs, baby</i>
<i>Let's talk about you and me</i>

02:28.919 --> 02:30.546
<i>You don't have to be rich</i>

02:30.721 --> 02:32.985
<i>- Give me all your loving</i>
<i>- To be my pearl</i>

02:33.157 --> 02:37.093
<i>You don't have to be cool</i>
<i>To rule my world</i>

02:37.261 --> 02:41.357
<i>Ain't no particular song</i>
<i>I'm more compatible with</i>

02:41.532 --> 02:43.966
<i>I just want your extra...</i>

02:44.134 --> 02:46.864
Boys. Boys.

02:47.037 --> 02:48.868
Give a chick a chance.

02:49.039 --> 02:53.476
<i>Well, since my baby left me</i>

02:53.644 --> 02:57.045
<i>I found a new place to dwell</i>

02:57.214 --> 03:01.708
<i>It's down at the end of Lonely Street</i>
<i>At Heartbreak Hotel</i>

03:01.886 --> 03:05.322
<i>And I said, "I'm feelin' so lonely, baby</i>

03:08.225 --> 03:10.523
<i>Oh, I'm feelin' so lonely"...</i>

03:10.694 --> 03:13.686
<i>I could die</i>

03:15.199 --> 03:20.569
<i>Don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

03:20.738 --> 03:25.732
<i>Don't have to be cool to rule my world</i>

03:25.910 --> 03:27.400
<i>You rule my world</i>

03:27.578 --> 03:32.277
<i>You're the particular song</i>
<i>I'm compatible with</i>

03:32.449 --> 03:34.280
<i>I just want your</i>

03:34.451 --> 03:37.978
<i>- Extra time</i>
<i>- Extra time</i>

03:38.155 --> 03:44.253
<i>- And your kiss</i>
<i>- And your kiss</i>

03:44.428 --> 03:47.761
<i>His mom and dad met in the usual way.</i>

03:47.932 --> 03:50.662
<i>The song became love...</i>

03:50.834 --> 03:54.271
<i>... and love became the egg.</i>

03:58.977 --> 04:00.604
Memphis?

04:00.779 --> 04:03.111
- You got it, sugar?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

04:03.281 --> 04:04.873
Safe and warm.

04:05.050 --> 04:06.540
Hold it tight, now.

04:06.718 --> 04:09.152
Whoa, I think I felt a move in there.

04:09.321 --> 04:11.414
<i>And in the usual way...</i>

04:11.590 --> 04:14.252
<i>... the moms left for the fishing season...</i>

04:14.426 --> 04:18.658
<i>... while the dads stayed home</i>
<i>to do egg time.</i>

04:18.830 --> 04:20.092
You gonna be okay, Daddy?

04:20.265 --> 04:23.792
Oh, sure, honey. We'll be waiting for you,
right here on Lonely Street.

04:23.969 --> 04:28.838
<i>I love you more and more, tell me why</i>

04:29.007 --> 04:30.304
Bye-bye, now.

04:30.475 --> 04:33.774
Goodbye, Norma Jean.
Don't you worry about a thing.

04:33.945 --> 04:36.778
<i>Don't wanna let you go</i>

04:37.716 --> 04:41.311
<i>I never can say goodbye, boy</i>

04:44.189 --> 04:47.454
When all others leave...

04:48.226 --> 04:49.693
...we remain!

04:49.861 --> 04:52.557
When the sun vanishes...

04:53.665 --> 04:55.656
...we remain!

04:55.834 --> 04:59.326
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely</i>
<i>I'm feelin' so lonely...</i>

04:59.504 --> 05:04.498
Heed the wisdoms, brothers!
Make a huddle!

05:04.676 --> 05:07.509
Warm thy egg!

05:07.679 --> 05:09.237
Make a huddle!

05:10.448 --> 05:12.609
- Share the cold!
- Share the cold.

05:12.784 --> 05:16.550
Each must take his turn
against the icy blast...

05:16.721 --> 05:19.747
...if we are to survive the endless night.

05:21.893 --> 05:24.521
<i>Raise your voices, brothers!</i>

05:24.696 --> 05:27.358
<i>Give praise to the Great 'Guin...</i>

05:27.532 --> 05:33.164
<i>... who puts songs in our hearts</i>
<i>and fish in our bellies!</i>

05:39.944 --> 05:43.004
<i>Ain't no particular song</i>
<i>I'm more compatible with</i>

05:43.214 --> 05:46.581
Oh, baby, I think I wanna dance now.

05:48.420 --> 05:49.944
No, no, no.

05:52.357 --> 05:55.155
<i>There is a wisdom,</i>
<i>brothers and sisters...</i>

05:55.326 --> 05:58.693
<i>... that stands above all others.</i>

05:59.330 --> 06:02.027
<i>- Never, ever...</i>
- It's okay.

06:02.201 --> 06:04.066
<i>...no matter what...</i>
- No harm done. See?

06:04.236 --> 06:06.136
<i>... drop your egg.</i>

06:06.305 --> 06:09.331
No, we're cool. We're cool.

06:17.850 --> 06:23.288
<i>Of the many thousands who sang</i>
<i>through that long night of winter...</i>

06:23.456 --> 06:27.654
<i>... it was Memphis</i>
<i>who cried out most fervently...</i>

06:27.827 --> 06:32.958
<i>... to turn the Earth</i>
<i>and bring back the sun.</i>

07:11.403 --> 07:13.268
- It's a boy!
- Hey, it's a girl!

07:13.439 --> 07:15.464
- What a peach!
- What a bruiser!

07:15.641 --> 07:17.802
- Come here, son.
- Come to Daddy, there you go.

07:17.977 --> 07:19.877
Son, you have made
your daddy so proud.

07:20.045 --> 07:21.876
It's all genetics, you know.

07:32.491 --> 07:33.719
Memphis?

07:33.893 --> 07:36.657
Is everything okay?

07:37.530 --> 07:40.328
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

07:45.905 --> 07:47.532
- Is it empty?
- Honey.

07:47.706 --> 07:48.798
- Can I have it?
- Gloria.

07:48.974 --> 07:51.135
It's okay, Maurice.

07:57.883 --> 08:00.545
It happens sometimes, Memphis.

08:01.153 --> 08:02.245
Yeah.

08:08.428 --> 08:09.952
Wait, you hear that?

08:11.264 --> 08:12.856
- Yeah.
- Hey, I can hear you, buddy.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.027
Oh, your papa's here, it's okay.

08:17.871 --> 08:21.136
Oh, he's okay, Maurice.
Whoa, there it is!

08:21.308 --> 08:23.538
That's his little foot there.

08:24.211 --> 08:26.008
There's his other one.

08:28.381 --> 08:29.780
That's different.

08:29.950 --> 08:31.850
Hey! Come back here, Mr. Mumble.

08:32.018 --> 08:33.007
Gloria...

08:33.186 --> 08:35.245
She can call him
whatever the heck she likes.

08:35.422 --> 08:37.253
Whoa, little Mumble.

08:42.295 --> 08:44.525
- Mumble? Mumble?
- You okay?

08:45.765 --> 08:48.461
Freezing. Freezing.

08:48.635 --> 08:49.932
Oh, you'll get used to it.

08:51.905 --> 08:53.304
Come on. Come to your daddy.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.234
- What do you make of that?
- Little wobbly in the knees.

08:58.411 --> 08:59.605
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

08:59.779 --> 09:01.076
What you doing there, boy?

09:01.248 --> 09:02.545
I'm happy, Pa.

09:03.383 --> 09:04.748
What you doing with your feet?

09:06.386 --> 09:07.876
They're happy too.

09:08.054 --> 09:10.579
- I wouldn't do that around folks, son.
- Why not?

09:10.757 --> 09:13.624
- Well, it just ain't penguin, okay?
- Okay.

09:13.793 --> 09:17.160
Yeah. Hey, come on over here.
Get under here. Get warm.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.594
Watch the beak. Watch the beak... Beak!

09:19.766 --> 09:21.199
The beak.

09:21.368 --> 09:24.098
Okay, good boy.

09:30.010 --> 09:32.274
So late. What's keeping them?

09:32.445 --> 09:36.245
Pray, brothers, the Great 'Guin
does not test us with a lean season.

09:36.416 --> 09:40.011
Why, Noah? Have we not all been dutiful?

09:41.087 --> 09:42.418
So when you see your mama...

09:42.589 --> 09:44.716
- I stand perfectly still.
- You got it.

09:44.891 --> 09:47.621
But how will I know
which one's my mama?

09:47.794 --> 09:48.886
Oh, you'll know.

09:49.062 --> 09:51.860
She's got a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk.

09:52.232 --> 09:55.668
And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

10:01.975 --> 10:04.170
Hey, wait. I see them. I see them!

10:04.344 --> 10:05.572
You're right! You're right!

10:05.745 --> 10:07.975
Wives, ho!

10:08.481 --> 10:10.039
Wives, ho!

10:10.483 --> 10:12.110
Wives, ho!

10:12.452 --> 10:16.014
Wait, no. Wait, no, Mumble, get back here.
No, Mumble! Get back... Mumble!

10:16.190 --> 10:19.455
Mumble! Mumble!

10:20.094 --> 10:22.358
Mumble!

10:24.398 --> 10:25.990
Michelle? Michelle?

10:26.167 --> 10:28.601
- Roxanne?
- Michelle?

10:30.237 --> 10:32.535
Alfie?

10:34.241 --> 10:36.869
- Maurice!
- Michelle! Michelle!

10:37.044 --> 10:38.204
Mommy!

10:38.379 --> 10:39.971
Oh, she's so darling.

10:40.147 --> 10:44.811
Excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me.
Mumble? Mumble?

10:44.986 --> 10:46.010
Oh, Mumble.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.519
- Mama?
- Mumble!

10:48.689 --> 10:50.850
- Mama?
- Mumble!

10:51.025 --> 10:52.390
Mumble!

10:52.560 --> 10:53.822
Mama? Mama?

10:53.995 --> 10:57.055
- Mumble, boy, where are you?
- Mama!

11:02.937 --> 11:04.768
Memphis?

11:06.140 --> 11:08.836
Oh, Mama. Oh, Mama.

11:09.610 --> 11:11.703
- Oh, my.
- Daddy.

11:12.079 --> 11:13.842
So where's the baby?

11:14.015 --> 11:16.313
Well, honey, I'll find him.

11:16.484 --> 11:18.577
- You lost the baby? Memphis!
- It's okay.

11:18.753 --> 11:20.618
- Mama? Mama?
- Stay!

11:23.357 --> 11:24.688
- Come to Mommy.
- No, Mumble.

11:24.859 --> 11:26.952
Mama, Mama.

11:27.495 --> 11:29.326
Hey, what's wrong with his feet?

11:29.497 --> 11:33.228
Oh, that's just a little thing he's got going.
He'll grow out of it.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.301
Mama!

11:36.470 --> 11:39.098
Oh, Memphis, he's gorgeous.

11:39.273 --> 11:41.969
- Isn't he, though?
- Look at you.

11:42.143 --> 11:44.134
I got something for you.

11:44.311 --> 11:46.040
Open up.

11:49.550 --> 11:52.246
Oh, I love the way she does that.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.690
<i>W, X, Y and Z</i>

11:57.858 --> 11:59.052
Good morning, class.

11:59.226 --> 12:01.592
Good morning, Miss Viola.

12:01.762 --> 12:02.751
Right.

12:02.930 --> 12:06.331
Well, today we begin with the most
important lesson you will ever learn...

12:06.500 --> 12:07.797
...at Penguin Elementary.

12:07.968 --> 12:09.629
Does anyone know what that is?

12:09.804 --> 12:11.066
Anyone? Anyone?

12:11.238 --> 12:12.227
Someone? Seymour?

12:12.406 --> 12:14.306
- Fishing?
- No.

12:14.475 --> 12:15.840
Mumble?

12:16.010 --> 12:17.602
Don't eat yellow snow?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.177
No, that's not it, no.

12:19.346 --> 12:22.509
- It's our Heartsong, Miss.
- Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes.

12:22.683 --> 12:25.551
Without our Heartsong,
we can't be truly penguin, can we?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.517
No.

12:27.689 --> 12:31.056
But, my dears, it's not something
that I can actually teach you.

12:31.226 --> 12:33.626
Does anybody know why?
Anyone? Anyone?

12:33.795 --> 12:35.456
You can't teach it to us, ma'am...

12:35.630 --> 12:39.259
...because we have to find
our Heartsongs all by ourselves.

12:39.434 --> 12:40.423
Well done, you.

12:40.602 --> 12:42.263
It's the voice you hear inside...

12:42.437 --> 12:44.029
...who you truly are.

12:44.206 --> 12:46.731
Yes. Thank you, Gloria.
Excellent, lovely, thank you.

12:46.908 --> 12:49.274
So let's all be very still now.

12:49.444 --> 12:52.709
Take a moment and let it come to you.

12:52.881 --> 12:53.973
- I got one!
- Pick me!

12:54.149 --> 12:57.084
- Pick me! Pick me!
- One at a time. Yes, Seymour.

12:57.252 --> 13:01.382
<i>Don't push me</i>
<i>'Cause I am close to the edge</i>

13:01.556 --> 13:04.491
<i>I'm trying not to lose my head</i>

13:04.659 --> 13:07.628
Yes, I like that one. I could
really get jiggy with that. Lovely.

13:07.796 --> 13:09.388
I'm ready. I got one.

13:09.564 --> 13:12.124
Oh, I thought you might, Gloria.

13:14.703 --> 13:18.002
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

13:18.173 --> 13:20.607
<i>Into hearts of those</i>

13:20.775 --> 13:23.369
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

13:23.545 --> 13:26.446
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

13:26.615 --> 13:28.640
<i>To a penguin</i>

13:28.817 --> 13:35.245
<i>Who has laid too many bets</i>

13:35.590 --> 13:37.217
That's as far as I got so far.

13:37.392 --> 13:39.986
- Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely.
- That's beautiful.

13:40.162 --> 13:43.427
Well, Mumble, since
you seem so keen to share.

13:44.232 --> 13:48.168
Mine's sort of a boom and a:

13:50.872 --> 13:52.169
And another boom.

13:52.340 --> 13:53.466
You heard that in there?

13:53.642 --> 13:55.906
- Do you like it?
- I'm afraid that's not a tune.

13:56.378 --> 14:00.337
- It's not?
- No, dear. A tune is like:

14:03.685 --> 14:05.812
Oh, okay.

14:10.592 --> 14:11.854
Who is that?

14:12.027 --> 14:14.860
That is the offspring of Memphis
and Norma Jean.

14:15.030 --> 14:16.588
The wee hippity-hopper.

14:23.004 --> 14:24.995
It's not funny!

14:25.173 --> 14:27.198
No. No, not in the least.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.834
A penguin without a Heartsong
is hardly a penguin at all.

14:31.013 --> 14:33.447
I think he broke my ear.

14:34.584 --> 14:36.313
In all my years, I've never, I mean...

14:36.485 --> 14:40.080
And you having such fine voices.
Well, it's bizarre.

14:40.256 --> 14:43.783
Did anything happen, you know,
during early development?

14:43.960 --> 14:46.394
No, all fine. Normal incubation.

14:46.562 --> 14:47.893
- Right.
- Wasn't it, honey?

14:48.064 --> 14:51.659
Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter,
I guess.

14:51.834 --> 14:52.823
Right, right.

14:53.002 --> 14:55.470
- He did hatch a little late...
- Yes, I understand. Yes.

14:55.638 --> 14:58.698
- To think he might spend his life alone...
- Quite, quite.

14:58.874 --> 15:01.035
...never to meet his one true love.

15:01.210 --> 15:04.407
Oh, please, Miss Viola,
isn't there something we can do?

15:05.548 --> 15:08.039
Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan.

15:08.217 --> 15:09.206
Mrs. Astrakhan?

15:09.385 --> 15:12.149
If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can.

15:16.525 --> 15:17.753
Can't sing?

15:17.927 --> 15:20.191
Can't sing? Rubbish, darling.

15:20.363 --> 15:22.991
Every little penguin has a song.

15:23.165 --> 15:24.792
When I have finished...

15:24.967 --> 15:28.630
...your singing will be giving everyone
the goose pimple.

15:28.804 --> 15:32.706
Now, to begin.
First, we must find a feeling.

15:32.875 --> 15:36.003
Happy feeling, sad feeling.

15:36.178 --> 15:39.511
Maybe lonely feeling.

15:40.016 --> 15:41.881
You feel it?

15:42.051 --> 15:45.077
Good. Now, let it out.

15:45.254 --> 15:47.950
Be spontaneous.

15:51.894 --> 15:53.191
That, what is that?

15:53.362 --> 15:55.557
I'm being spontan-you-us.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.832
Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.367
You want to make the egg?

16:01.537 --> 16:02.629
Oh, yes.

16:02.805 --> 16:08.209
Well, sing! And no jiggy-jog.
Do not move muscle.

16:08.377 --> 16:10.504
No moving!

16:11.280 --> 16:14.716
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

16:15.418 --> 16:16.476
Enough!

16:16.652 --> 16:19.849
Okay. We go back to the top.

16:20.423 --> 16:23.950
Forget body. Look inside soul.

16:24.126 --> 16:27.823
Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling.

16:27.997 --> 16:31.364
So enormous it fills whole body.

16:31.534 --> 16:34.799
It must escape or you explode.

16:34.970 --> 16:37.804
- Now, open your little beak.
- Come on.

16:37.974 --> 16:41.102
Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it.

16:41.278 --> 16:43.576
Now... Now...

16:43.747 --> 16:48.446
<i>Now</i>

17:17.347 --> 17:19.713
Disaster! Catastrophe!

17:19.883 --> 17:22.147
I never fail before.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.447
Never! Never!

17:34.231 --> 17:37.496
- Well, I thought it was kind of cute.
- But it just ain't penguin, okay?

17:37.667 --> 17:40.932
So what if he's a little different?
I always kind of liked different.

17:41.104 --> 17:43.766
He's not different.
He's a regular emperor penguin.

17:43.940 --> 17:45.965
Hey, you know what? I can leave school.

17:46.143 --> 17:48.338
I can go to work. The three of us.

17:48.512 --> 17:52.346
Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere
till you got yourself an education.

17:52.516 --> 17:55.451
You get them singing muscles
big and strong, you got that?

17:55.619 --> 17:56.745
I'll try, Pa.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.412
You bet you will. The word "triumph"
starts with "try," and it ends with...?

18:00.590 --> 18:04.253
- "Umph."
- That's right. A great big "umph."

18:05.028 --> 18:06.586
I'm going fishing.

18:12.536 --> 18:14.731
Oh, Mumble.

18:18.475 --> 18:20.909
<i>That first hard summer...</i>

18:21.077 --> 18:24.103
<i>... while his mom and dad</i>
<i>were working overtime...</i>

18:24.281 --> 18:27.182
<i>... on the great commute to the sea...</i>

18:27.350 --> 18:31.684
<i>... Mumble found a place</i>
<i>away from disapproving eyes...</i>

18:31.855 --> 18:37.316
<i>... where a funky little fella</i>
<i>could be himself.</i>

19:31.949 --> 19:34.417
Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird?

19:34.585 --> 19:36.815
Nothing. What are you doing?

19:36.988 --> 19:39.821
Nothing. Just dropped in
for a little lunch.

19:39.991 --> 19:42.721
There's food? Here?

19:43.261 --> 19:44.819
Leg or wing?

19:44.996 --> 19:47.430
Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin.

19:47.598 --> 19:51.295
Exactly. The flipper birds,
that's you, eat the fish.

19:51.469 --> 19:54.996
The flying birds, that's me,
eat the flipper bird and the fish.

19:55.172 --> 19:57.402
And lately, there ain't a lot of fish.

19:57.575 --> 19:59.668
- So...
- This time I'm getting the juicy bits.

19:59.844 --> 20:02.244
- Me first!
- Hey, you want a piece of me?

20:02.413 --> 20:05.075
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to think about lunch.

20:05.249 --> 20:08.446
Wait! Watch this!

20:13.724 --> 20:18.821
Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen.
For once, we're gonna do this civilized.

20:18.996 --> 20:21.590
- Now, get in line...
- Hey! What's that on your leg?

20:21.766 --> 20:24.894
- What? This little thing?
- Oh, no. Don't start him on that.

20:25.069 --> 20:28.197
Shut up! The little flipper bird
asked me a perceptive question.

20:28.372 --> 20:31.068
- A question like that deserves an answer.
- Here we go.

20:31.242 --> 20:32.903
I got two words for you:

20:33.578 --> 20:36.138
"Alien abduction."

20:36.314 --> 20:38.009
- Oh, you had to ask.
- Have mercy.

20:38.182 --> 20:40.047
Quiet!

20:40.217 --> 20:43.618
Now, little buddy,
there is something out there.

20:43.788 --> 20:45.881
Creatures. Not like us.

20:46.057 --> 20:48.287
Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too.

20:48.459 --> 20:49.949
- Ask me how I know.
- How?

20:50.127 --> 20:52.289
Because I've been captured by them,
that's how.

20:52.464 --> 20:53.488
Unbelievable.

20:53.665 --> 20:55.633
What do you mean "unbelievable?"
It's true.

20:55.801 --> 20:58.031
I'm sitting on a rock,
minding my own business...

20:58.203 --> 20:59.795
...when suddenly, they're onto me.

20:59.972 --> 21:02.099
These beings, like big ugly penguins.

21:02.274 --> 21:04.401
Fat, flabby faces with front-ways eyes...

21:04.576 --> 21:07.977
...no feathers, no beaks,
and these... These appendages.

21:08.313 --> 21:10.838
They probe me. They tie me up.
They strap me down.

21:11.016 --> 21:13.883
They take this pointy thing
and they stick it into me.

21:14.052 --> 21:16.612
And then, blackout.

21:16.788 --> 21:18.187
Gosh.

21:18.357 --> 21:21.292
I woke up and there's this...
This thing on me.

21:21.460 --> 21:25.692
Every flying bird is dissing me,
"Hey, what's happening, yellow leg?"

21:25.864 --> 21:27.855
It was humiliating.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.193
And then what?

21:29.368 --> 21:32.394
It was humiliating.
What more do you want?

21:33.405 --> 21:35.532
They could have eated you.

21:36.508 --> 21:38.669
Yeah. Yeah.

21:38.844 --> 21:42.075
I guess my pitiful cries for mercy
appealed to their better nature.

21:42.514 --> 21:45.415
Can I appeal to your better nature?

21:46.184 --> 21:49.381
Nice try, kid, but no.

21:51.523 --> 21:53.491
No. No. No!

21:53.659 --> 21:55.490
What you doing down there, flipper bird?

21:55.661 --> 21:56.650
Get up here.

21:56.828 --> 21:58.455
Get back up here this minute.

21:58.630 --> 22:00.791
Oh, great. You let him get away.
Didn't you?

22:00.966 --> 22:02.263
All your screwy alien talk.

22:02.434 --> 22:04.698
- Hey, I'm an abductee.
- Abduct this.

22:04.870 --> 22:07.498
- Don't make me call Uncle Angie.
- Oh, fine.

22:07.739 --> 22:09.764
Where youse going? I'm an abductee!

22:09.941 --> 22:13.502
- I don't care what you are, I'm hungry!
- Would you like to hear our specials?

22:13.679 --> 22:16.944
How about fish? There's no fish.
How about penguin? There's no penguin.

22:17.115 --> 22:19.106
What are we gonna eat?!

22:27.693 --> 22:33.632
<i>There's a world where I can go</i>

22:33.799 --> 22:39.135
<i>And tell my secrets to</i>

22:39.304 --> 22:41.465
<i>In my room</i>

22:41.640 --> 22:45.076
<i>Paying no mind to his dancing heart...</i>

22:45.243 --> 22:49.577
<i>... the kid saw out his school days</i>
<i>at the back of the class...</i>

22:49.748 --> 22:52.774
<i>... lost in his imaginings.</i>

22:53.752 --> 22:56.619
<i>Now it's dark and I'm...</i>

22:57.055 --> 23:01.823
<i>What fabulous worlds lay out there,</i>
<i>far beyond the ice?</i>

23:02.462 --> 23:04.987
<i>I won't be afraid</i>

23:05.531 --> 23:06.964
<i>Was there any place...</i>

23:07.133 --> 23:10.625
<i>... where one small penguin</i>
<i>without a Heartsong...</i>

23:10.803 --> 23:13.499
<i>... could ever truly belong?</i>

23:13.673 --> 23:17.439
<i>In my room</i>

23:29.989 --> 23:32.423
And so, a thousand generations ago...

23:32.592 --> 23:36.119
...our forefathers
forsook our wings for flippers.

23:36.295 --> 23:39.321
You graduates going to sea
for the first time...

23:39.499 --> 23:42.195
...are to reap the benefits
of their wise choice.

23:42.969 --> 23:45.403
These are lean and uncertain times.

23:45.571 --> 23:48.335
But by the power
of the ancient penguin wisdoms...

23:48.508 --> 23:51.602
...we, my brethren, will endure.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.576
- "Blah, blah, blah."
- Norma Jean.

23:54.747 --> 23:58.649
Who is he to say my boy can't graduate?
He's not hurting anyone.

23:58.818 --> 24:03.346
- True to our ways
and you will always be worthy of this...

24:03.523 --> 24:08.654
...our brave penguin nation. <i>Excelsior!</i>

24:21.407 --> 24:23.671
Ocean, here I come!

24:25.411 --> 24:29.040
You know what? We're gonna have
a little graduation ceremony of our own.

24:29.215 --> 24:30.580
- You mean it, Ma?
- You betcha.

24:30.750 --> 24:33.412
<i>- Excelsior!</i>
<i>- Excelsior!</i>

24:34.453 --> 24:36.114
Keep it down.

24:36.289 --> 24:38.723
- Pa.
- Memphis.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.329
- Go get them, tiger.
- Thanks, Ma.

24:47.033 --> 24:49.263
- Make every moment count!
- Got you, Ma!

24:49.435 --> 24:51.528
- Remember, "Stranger Danger."
- Yeah, sure, Pa.

24:51.704 --> 24:55.902
And watch out for those leopard seals
and them killer whales.

24:56.075 --> 24:57.440
Mark this, Noah.

24:57.610 --> 25:03.105
That boy was always a bad egg.
I'm telling you, no good will come of this.

25:12.759 --> 25:14.522
Guys!

25:15.562 --> 25:17.462
Wait up!

25:41.955 --> 25:43.149
What do you think?

25:43.323 --> 25:46.087
- You first.
- No, you first.

25:47.227 --> 25:49.695
No. No, no, no.

25:54.301 --> 25:55.461
Stop pushing!

25:59.973 --> 26:03.340
- What was that?
- I think it was the fuzzball.

26:08.482 --> 26:10.609
See any blood?

26:13.587 --> 26:15.919
What you waiting for?

27:14.148 --> 27:15.740
Hey, Gloria!

27:15.917 --> 27:19.318
Gloria, I adore-ia. I'd like to see more-ia.

27:19.487 --> 27:21.148
Gloria.

27:40.174 --> 27:42.472
- Mumble?
- Gloria.

27:46.914 --> 27:48.438
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

27:48.616 --> 27:51.141
Fall back, coming through!

28:09.704 --> 28:13.606
Gloria? All my life,
I've wanted to say that you're so...

28:13.775 --> 28:15.834
- Fish.
- Yeah. You're so fish.

28:16.010 --> 28:18.069
No. Fish!

28:18.246 --> 28:20.111
Fish!

28:21.549 --> 28:23.141
Oh, that's mine.

28:29.123 --> 28:32.058
- That's lousy.
- You didn't get one?

28:35.863 --> 28:36.955
Sorry.

28:37.131 --> 28:38.359
Gloria. You got one?

28:38.533 --> 28:41.001
- Nope. Not this time.
- You have it.

28:41.169 --> 28:43.865
- Thank you, Mumble, but it's yours.
- I want you to have it.

28:44.038 --> 28:46.700
- No. You caught it. You eat it.
- I want you to...

28:46.874 --> 28:49.104
Skua! You get back here!

28:56.851 --> 29:00.412
- Come on.
- Mumble! Let go!

29:00.588 --> 29:03.580
Mumble! Let go!

29:08.129 --> 29:10.290
You just let him get away!

29:19.073 --> 29:22.043
- Is he breathing?
- He's certainly not eating.

29:22.211 --> 29:25.612
Mumble? Are you okay?

29:26.482 --> 29:27.949
Mumble?

29:29.318 --> 29:31.980
Take the fish.

29:32.154 --> 29:34.622
- What?
- Take the stupid fish.

29:34.790 --> 29:36.883
Oh, okay.

29:46.768 --> 29:49.066
Thank you, Mumble.

You're welcome.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.596
You're great. That was great.

31:21.763 --> 31:24.163
<i>Oh, baby, find me</i>

31:24.333 --> 31:27.166
Come on. Put your flippers
in the air, now.

31:27.436 --> 31:30.372
<i>Find me somebody to love</i>

31:30.540 --> 31:33.441
<i>Find me somebody to love</i>

31:33.610 --> 31:36.408
<i>Find me somebody to love</i>

31:36.579 --> 31:39.173
<i>Find me somebody to love</i>

31:40.216 --> 31:42.480
I'm searching high and low.

31:42.885 --> 31:45.513
I'm searching the high and low.

31:45.855 --> 31:48.915
Yes, there's somebody out there
who needs to find me.

31:49.092 --> 31:51.458
<i>Somebody, anybody</i>

31:51.628 --> 31:53.653
I'm somebody.

31:53.830 --> 31:57.960
<i>I wanna love someone</i>
<i>Send someone over here</i>

31:58.134 --> 32:03.265
<i>Can anybody find me</i>

32:03.439 --> 32:10.038
<i>Somebody to</i>

32:10.213 --> 32:13.307
<i>Love</i>

32:14.150 --> 32:15.515
Mumble!

32:15.685 --> 32:18.745
- Who do you think you are?
- Yeah, you're spoiling it for everybody.

32:18.921 --> 32:21.856
- Take a flying leap.
- Yeah, jump in the lake.

32:28.698 --> 32:32.964
<i>Where is my baby?</i>

32:35.672 --> 32:40.769
<i>Anybody find me, find me</i>
<i>Find me, find me</i>

32:40.943 --> 32:46.279
<i>Somebody</i>

33:08.404 --> 33:11.066
Okay, fellas. Cut it out.

33:14.777 --> 33:17.541
I'm completely terrified.

33:19.048 --> 33:20.242
Gloria?

33:21.284 --> 33:22.911
Guys?

33:25.388 --> 33:28.653
Get up here or I'll come in after you.

35:02.152 --> 35:03.710
- Safe!
- Oh, yeah!

35:03.887 --> 35:06.082
- You the bomb, bro.
- That's a 9.8.

35:06.256 --> 35:07.484
- I give you 10.
- Why?

35:10.394 --> 35:13.192
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.
Bring it. Bring it on.

35:13.363 --> 35:15.558
- Kiss my frozen tushy.
- Kiss it. Kiss it.

35:19.069 --> 35:22.903
Come here, sausage.
I take you with ketchup.

35:23.073 --> 35:25.564
But first you got to catch up.

35:25.742 --> 35:28.734
Oh, here he comes.
You better move in a half an hour.

35:28.912 --> 35:35.875
Let's get out of here.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.382
- Hey, amigo, do that again.
- Do what?

35:39.556 --> 35:41.649
- That thing with the...
- The clickety-clickety.

35:41.825 --> 35:42.814
- That.
- Yeah, do it.

35:42.993 --> 35:46.589
- Come on, come on.
- Well, I just kind of go:

35:48.199 --> 35:49.496
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, nice.

35:49.667 --> 35:51.931
And then this:

35:56.274 --> 35:59.038
Way to go! It's amazing!

36:01.546 --> 36:04.106
- Oh, the little whisker.
- Look at him.

36:04.282 --> 36:07.581
Oh, he's leaving.
Oh, no, that was his face!

36:07.752 --> 36:10.414
Remember, dumplings,
I know where you live.

36:10.588 --> 36:12.522
Yeah, it's called land, lard face.

36:13.591 --> 36:15.218
Flop back anytime, rubber butt!

36:18.229 --> 36:20.561
See you, fatty.

36:20.732 --> 36:22.666
That's cool. "See you, fatty!"

36:22.834 --> 36:25.564
Did it take you a while
to come up with that one?

36:25.737 --> 36:27.398
All right, way to go, tall guy.

36:27.572 --> 36:29.733
Give me fin, give me fin.

36:30.608 --> 36:33.202
<i>To the left, to the right</i>
<i>I'm getting it, oh, yes</i>

36:33.378 --> 36:35.039
<i>Look out, here I go</i>

36:35.213 --> 36:39.411
<i>I got it, I got it, I don't, I had it</i>

36:39.584 --> 36:41.575
Oh, my stomach hurts. I gotta pee.

36:42.854 --> 36:45.186
Ain't you coming, tall boy?

36:46.224 --> 36:49.193
What, you got something better to do?

36:50.395 --> 36:54.161
- No.
- Well, then, come along, Fluffy, let's go.

37:10.014 --> 37:12.608
Hey, stretch, you like to party?

37:12.784 --> 37:14.581
Party? I guess so.

37:14.752 --> 37:16.083
Well, stick with us, baby.

37:16.254 --> 37:19.280
Yeah, because we practically
own the action here.

37:19.457 --> 37:21.448
<i>Mambo!</i>

37:23.394 --> 37:25.828
Everybody's so... spontan-you-us.

37:25.997 --> 37:27.692
Spontan-you-us!

37:27.865 --> 37:29.162
And these are the bad times!

37:29.334 --> 37:32.667
- Yeah, our food chain go loco.
- Everyone a bit down.

37:32.837 --> 37:35.567
But it ain't gonna stop no party!

37:37.041 --> 37:38.633
- Viva la party!
- Watch me work.

37:38.810 --> 37:41.779
Gosh, he's eating rocks.

37:42.547 --> 37:45.710
- You hear what he said?
- "Eating rocks."

37:45.883 --> 37:47.544
But he had a rock in his mouth.

37:47.719 --> 37:51.087
That's no rock, hombre. It's love stones.

37:51.256 --> 37:54.248
- For building the nest.
- The one with the most pebbles wins.

37:54.426 --> 37:56.792
You know:

37:56.996 --> 37:58.987
You're not interested in <i>chicas?</i>

37:59.164 --> 38:00.461
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You kidding?

38:00.633 --> 38:03.625
Without us, the <i>chicas</i> got no boom.

38:04.536 --> 38:07.369
- Why aren't you collecting pebbles?
- Pebbles, schmebbles, man.

38:07.539 --> 38:11.134
We got personality, with a capital Y.
Why? Because we're hot.

38:11.310 --> 38:14.074
Watch and learn, tall boy.

38:14.713 --> 38:16.908
- Hey. Hey, baby.
- Over here, mama. Chicky baby.

38:17.082 --> 38:18.515
- Baby.
- What are you looking at?

38:18.684 --> 38:20.311
- You looking at me?
- Come over here.

38:20.486 --> 38:23.114
- Come on, <i>mamí.</i>
- You see something you like, yes?

38:23.288 --> 38:25.813
I don't think so. Not tonight, baby.

38:25.991 --> 38:28.619
Oh, don't be so snooty, booty.

38:28.794 --> 38:31.627
<i>That's the way... you like it, you like it</i>

38:31.797 --> 38:34.698
<i>You want it, I got it</i>
<i>Could've had it, you missed it</i>

38:34.867 --> 38:36.801
Look at the feet, huh?

38:39.371 --> 38:41.100
- Where'd you learn that?
- The big guy.

38:41.273 --> 38:42.797
- He from out of town.
- He with us.

38:42.975 --> 38:46.467
- Do it again.
- Do it, baby. Show me those flipping feet.

38:46.645 --> 38:50.308
- No, no, no. Sorry, girls.
- Some other time maybe.

38:50.482 --> 38:53.246
You guys are soft in the head, okay?

38:53.786 --> 38:54.775
Let's go.

38:54.953 --> 38:58.047
- Leave them wanting more, you know?
- Hold back till the season.

38:58.457 --> 39:00.982
- You show them what you got.
- Either you got it or not.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.788
- And the Amigos?
- We got it!

39:05.664 --> 39:07.222
You think I could get some of it?

39:07.399 --> 39:12.200
Hombre, you've got so much already,
you dangerous, baby.

39:12.371 --> 39:13.929
You really think so?

39:14.106 --> 39:15.835
You kidding? With moves like yours...

39:16.008 --> 39:18.476
...you must have all the ladies
drooling at your feet.

39:18.644 --> 39:22.808
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, listen to him. He's so cute.

39:22.981 --> 39:24.471
Let me tell something to you.

39:24.883 --> 39:28.751
Except for me, tall boy,
you got the most charisma of anybody.

39:28.921 --> 39:32.448
Put that ego away, Ramon,
you're gonna hurt someone.

39:32.624 --> 39:36.526
You so jealous. Just a moment.
I hear people wanting something.

39:36.695 --> 39:38.788
Me!

39:39.898 --> 39:42.389
<i>- Mambo</i>
<i>- Okay, you girlies, Mambo</i>

39:42.568 --> 39:46.095
<i>One more time now, mambo</i>
<i>Mambo, mambo, mambo</i>

39:46.271 --> 39:48.262
<i>Mambo!</i>

40:08.428 --> 40:11.522
Your turn, your turn.

40:11.698 --> 40:13.427
Oh, get down.

40:21.274 --> 40:23.640
Man, this guy is so accidentally cool.

40:25.044 --> 40:26.636
Okay, okay.

40:26.813 --> 40:27.939
Mama!

40:41.094 --> 40:43.153
Mommy!

41:05.485 --> 41:07.419
Come on, Fluffy.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.014
Oh, I love gravity.

41:12.192 --> 41:15.525
- Oh, I feel like reminiscing.
- Remin-icing?

42:43.017 --> 42:44.951
- It was too close.
- Come on, come on.

42:47.154 --> 42:49.622
Hey, guys! Where are we going?

42:49.790 --> 42:51.917
- We relocating.
- Placing ourselves elsewhere.

42:52.092 --> 42:55.061
- But that thing, what was it?
- How should we know?

42:55.229 --> 42:57.629
- We're penguins.
- Very little penguins.

42:57.798 --> 43:01.757
But where did it come from?
It's so weird, so alien.

43:01.936 --> 43:04.336
- What's he talking about?
- Some hombre called Elian.

43:04.505 --> 43:06.973
I don't know a guy Elian.
I knew a guy named Estevan...

43:07.141 --> 43:09.473
- Not Estevan, Elian.
- Guys, we have a mystery here.

43:09.643 --> 43:10.769
A mind-boggling mystery.

43:10.945 --> 43:12.879
So? What are we
supposed to do about it?

43:13.047 --> 43:15.277
Amigos, we gotta get
to the bottom of this thing.

43:16.116 --> 43:21.418
Big guy, let me tell something to you.
Come close. Don't be afraid.

43:21.588 --> 43:23.283
- You want answers?
- Yeah.

43:23.457 --> 43:24.822
- That's all you need?
- Yeah.

43:24.992 --> 43:25.981
- Nothing else?
- No.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.525
Then this is very easy.

43:27.695 --> 43:28.855
You go see Lovelace.

43:29.997 --> 43:31.624
- Lovelace.
- Go see Lovelace.

43:31.799 --> 43:33.790
- Genius, Ramon. You are the man.
- Thank you.

43:33.968 --> 43:35.731
- I take a moment for myself.
- Let's go.

43:35.903 --> 43:37.165
- Bow down.
- You the man.

43:37.338 --> 43:39.670
- That's enough, I feel your love.
- Who's Lovelace?

43:39.840 --> 43:42.172
- Lovelace is the guru.
- Go see Lovelace.

43:42.343 --> 43:44.436
- He got the answer to everything.
- Everything.

43:44.611 --> 43:46.704
- Really?
- Ask him, he never wrong.

43:46.880 --> 43:50.145
But first, you gonna need a pebble.

43:54.555 --> 43:58.252
<i>Hold it, y'all. I have a warning</i>
<i>for the audience.</i>

43:59.093 --> 44:02.392
<i>Ladies, please, avert your eyes...</i>

44:02.563 --> 44:05.896
<i>... because I've been known to hypnotize.</i>

44:06.767 --> 44:10.203
<i>You heard the voice,</i>
<i>now you're about to meet...</i>

44:10.371 --> 44:14.399
<i>... the one and only Lovelace,</i>
<i>in the flesh...</i>

44:14.576 --> 44:19.639
<i>... right here, right on, right now.</i>

44:19.814 --> 44:23.147
The devotion, please.

44:23.852 --> 44:25.046
Oh, yeah.

44:25.220 --> 44:27.745
And now, your question.

44:27.922 --> 44:29.355
Señor Lovelace...

44:29.891 --> 44:33.054
...my wife has disappeared. Is she alive?

44:36.197 --> 44:39.963
<i>Is she alive now?</i>
<i>Separate the truth from the jive</i>

44:40.168 --> 44:43.729
<i>Speak to me, oh, mystic beings</i>

44:46.107 --> 44:49.099
Yes! She's happy
and you're in her thoughts.

44:49.277 --> 44:51.006
Is she with another male?

44:51.179 --> 44:54.114
One pebble, one question. Next!

44:54.282 --> 44:57.308
Oh, Serene One.
Please ask the mystic beings...

44:57.485 --> 44:59.077
...will I ever be as rich as you?

44:59.554 --> 45:02.546
In your dreams, Jean. Next!

45:02.724 --> 45:04.715
- Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Get up there, big guy.

45:04.893 --> 45:08.761
- That's it. Don't be scared.
- Gentleman, please! One at a time.

45:09.397 --> 45:10.864
- We with him.
- Yeah, we together.

45:11.032 --> 45:13.466
- He got a beautiful question. Go.
- Do it.

45:13.635 --> 45:15.159
Just don't look him in the eye.

45:15.336 --> 45:17.327
Have you ever been abducted by aliens?

45:17.839 --> 45:20.330
Excuse me?
What kind of question is that? Next!

45:20.508 --> 45:21.497
No, wait, señor.

45:21.676 --> 45:25.976
I met a skua once, with something like that
on his foot, said he was abducted by aliens.

45:26.147 --> 45:30.914
This, friend, is my sacred talisman...

45:31.920 --> 45:33.615
<i>Talisman, talisman</i>

45:33.788 --> 45:37.451
...bestowed on me by the mystic beings...

45:37.625 --> 45:40.150
<i>Mystic beings</i>

45:40.328 --> 45:44.230
...during my epic journey
of enlightenment...

45:45.033 --> 45:46.523
...to the forbidden shore.

45:46.701 --> 45:48.999
<i>Forbidden shore</i>

45:49.170 --> 45:51.195
Oh, say it one more.

45:51.372 --> 45:54.933
<i>- Forbidden shore</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah</i>

45:55.110 --> 45:57.010
Wait, you saw mystic beings?

45:57.178 --> 46:00.477
I hear them! They speak through me!

46:00.648 --> 46:02.707
Oh, yeah.

46:02.884 --> 46:05.876
There's a power that makes me
stand upon this tower!

46:06.054 --> 46:09.080
Did they have front-ways eyes?
Did they probe you? Strap you down?

46:09.257 --> 46:12.658
Enough! "Did they probe me?"

46:12.827 --> 46:15.625
Too many questions!
You don't have enough pebbles, fool.

46:16.131 --> 46:17.996
You haven't answered
any of my questions.

46:18.166 --> 46:21.762
- How many questions he got?
- We've all got stuff to ask!

46:26.108 --> 46:27.700
Enough!

46:29.211 --> 46:31.736
You bring this stranger before me.

46:31.914 --> 46:36.476
He doubts my powers.
He compares me to a skua.

46:36.852 --> 46:38.843
The voices are shrieking in my head.

46:39.021 --> 46:41.922
They say, "Lovelace, who is this fool?

46:42.358 --> 46:47.591
Tell him! Tell him to go forth
and multiply!"

46:47.830 --> 46:49.354
Come to think of it...

46:49.532 --> 46:53.298
...why don't we all go forth and multiply?

46:53.469 --> 46:55.630
- Lovelace.
- What he saying?

46:55.804 --> 46:57.601
- It's mating season.
- Already?

46:57.773 --> 47:01.800
I will retire now
to my couch of perpetual indulgence.

47:01.977 --> 47:04.411
- Okay, ladies, who's first?
- Me!

47:04.580 --> 47:07.344
One at a time. Don't touch the talisman,
baby, please.

47:07.516 --> 47:10.781
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about us?

47:10.953 --> 47:13.717
<i>Lovelace, Lovelace, Lovelace!</i>

47:13.889 --> 47:15.652
Hear me!

47:15.824 --> 47:17.849
There's not enough love in the world.

47:18.027 --> 47:20.086
Turn to the penguin next to you.

47:20.262 --> 47:22.662
Put your flippers up.
Fluff him up a little bit.

47:22.831 --> 47:25.299
And give him a great big hug.

47:25.467 --> 47:27.628
Okay, ladies.

47:27.803 --> 47:30.169
Oh, make that little noise again, girl.

47:32.308 --> 47:33.900
Hey, what he got we don't got, man?

47:34.076 --> 47:35.941
- What you hugging me for?
- He told me to.

47:36.111 --> 47:37.339
- Get away.
- No, you like it.

47:37.513 --> 47:38.537
Get off him, Ramon.

47:38.714 --> 47:40.705
Stretch, got any stones
where you come from?

47:40.883 --> 47:43.010
- We don't collect stones.
- You don't? Why not?

47:43.185 --> 47:44.174
We live on the ice.

47:44.353 --> 47:46.150
So how you win the heart of the ladies?

47:46.322 --> 47:48.813
Well, we sing.

47:50.426 --> 47:53.418
- Stop! That's crazy!
- You're kidding, right?

47:53.596 --> 47:55.427
No. We sing to each other.

47:55.598 --> 47:58.590
If someone special likes your song,
you know...

47:58.767 --> 48:00.598
Oh, and you have someone special?

48:00.769 --> 48:04.102
- A tall beauty in your dark romantic past?
- Of which you never speak?

48:04.273 --> 48:05.365
Well, sort of.

48:05.541 --> 48:08.339
Hey, let's go check it out.
Maybe she got some friends.

48:08.510 --> 48:09.499
I like them tall.

48:09.678 --> 48:11.077
It's never gonna work.

48:11.247 --> 48:13.010
- Hey, big guy.
- It's the loving season.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.672
All you gotta do is sing.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.317
That's the problem. I can't.

48:16.485 --> 48:18.953
- You a bird, ain't you?
- All birds can sing.

48:19.121 --> 48:21.385
<i>I don't sing like the birdie do</i>

48:22.625 --> 48:24.115
All right.

48:24.293 --> 48:25.851
<i>Find me, find me</i>

48:26.295 --> 48:29.060
What's he doing?

48:29.232 --> 48:31.962
- I think he's singing.
- I know singing, that's not singing.

48:34.004 --> 48:37.531
I heard an animal once do that,
but then they rolled him over, he was dead.

48:38.041 --> 48:41.533
Yeah. And when she sings,
it darn near breaks your heart.

48:41.711 --> 48:43.474
You in tragic shape, man.

48:43.647 --> 48:45.808
- Don't worry. We can fix it.
- We can?

48:45.982 --> 48:48.143
- Absolutely. We can. We can.
- We can?

48:48.318 --> 48:50.752
- Really?
- Yes! Let me tell something to you.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.287
- Come close. Closer. You wanna sing?
- Yeah.

48:54.457 --> 48:55.947
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

48:56.126 --> 48:58.526
You making fun of me?
Then this is very easy.

48:58.695 --> 49:01.789
Really? Gosh, if I could sing,
that would change everything.

49:01.965 --> 49:06.163
You will sing. You just got to do
exactly what I say.

49:06.336 --> 49:08.463
- Okay.
- Did I say "okay"?

49:08.638 --> 49:10.128
- No.
- No. What did I say?

49:10.307 --> 49:13.834
- Do exactly what you say.
- Exactly what I say.

49:16.246 --> 49:22.207
<i>Don't push me</i>
<i>'Cause I'm close to the edge</i>

49:24.287 --> 49:28.553
<i>I'm trying not to lose my...</i>

49:29.526 --> 49:31.084
<i>Gloria</i>

49:31.261 --> 49:33.456
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes</i>
<i>It makes me wonder</i>

49:33.630 --> 49:34.858
<i>How I keep from going under</i>

49:35.031 --> 49:38.728
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

49:38.902 --> 49:45.364
<i>Into hearts of those</i>
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

49:45.542 --> 49:49.774
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

49:49.946 --> 49:55.612
<i>To a penguin who has laid too many bets</i>

49:56.119 --> 49:59.577
<i>I'll make love to you</i>
<i>Like you want me to</i>

49:59.756 --> 50:02.691
<i>And I'll hold you tight, baby, all...</i>

50:02.859 --> 50:04.121
<i>Gloria</i>

50:04.294 --> 50:09.755
<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

50:09.933 --> 50:11.764
<i>And says, "Baby..."</i>

50:11.935 --> 50:13.163
<i>Shake a bon-bon, Shake a...</i>

50:13.336 --> 50:14.803
<i>It don't work</i>

50:14.971 --> 50:20.102
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

50:20.276 --> 50:26.340
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

50:26.516 --> 50:29.007
Boys! Boys!

50:29.185 --> 50:31.085
Boys!

50:51.442 --> 50:52.431
Mumble?

50:58.115 --> 50:59.104
Mumble.

51:00.951 --> 51:03.511
Oh, hi, Gloria.

51:09.994 --> 51:11.621
And this is you?

51:12.930 --> 51:15.922
Sure, it's me. You like?

51:17.067 --> 51:21.367
Well, I would, if it were really you, yeah.

51:22.473 --> 51:24.270
Well, it is me, sort of.

51:24.442 --> 51:26.137
Yeah.

51:26.310 --> 51:28.141
Turn around.

51:28.312 --> 51:29.870
- Turn around.
- Why?

51:30.047 --> 51:32.106
- Well, why not?
- Well...

51:35.019 --> 51:36.452
- What do you know?
- Yeah.

51:36.620 --> 51:38.815
<i>My way</i>

51:38.989 --> 51:41.423
- Gloria.
- Mumble, how could you?

51:43.060 --> 51:44.118
Hello.

51:44.295 --> 51:48.254
I know size can be daunting,
but don't be afraid. I love you.

51:48.432 --> 51:50.559
- Gloria, please.
- I love you.

51:50.734 --> 51:51.826
- Gloria!
- Gloria!

51:52.002 --> 51:53.094
- Gloria!
- Gloria!

51:53.270 --> 51:55.670
- Please, Gloria, wait!
- Please, Gloria, wait for me!

51:57.675 --> 51:58.903
- Stop it!
- Okay.

51:59.076 --> 52:02.239
Mumble, what could
you possibly be thinking?

52:02.413 --> 52:04.438
I don't know what else to do.

52:10.554 --> 52:12.215
Oh, Gloria, no.

52:12.389 --> 52:15.654
<i>Gloria</i>

52:15.826 --> 52:19.728
<i>Gloria</i>

52:20.231 --> 52:21.289
Go up there, right now.

52:21.465 --> 52:25.799
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand...</i>

52:25.970 --> 52:28.097
Gloria. Gloria.

52:28.272 --> 52:30.001
Sing to this.

52:32.443 --> 52:36.174
Mumble, you're embarrassing me.

52:42.420 --> 52:44.684
Baby... it don't work.

52:48.059 --> 52:49.720
<i>Baby</i>

52:59.170 --> 53:01.730
<i>So slowly</i>

53:01.907 --> 53:06.469
<i>So slowly into hearts of those</i>

53:06.645 --> 53:12.550
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

53:12.717 --> 53:16.744
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

53:16.922 --> 53:22.417
<i>To a penguin that has laid too many bets</i>

53:22.594 --> 53:26.587
<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

53:26.765 --> 53:30.599
<i>And says, "Baby... it don't work"</i>

53:30.769 --> 53:34.762
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

53:34.940 --> 53:41.903
<i>You sing and you shake the hurt</i>

53:42.380 --> 53:44.041
<i>Dance!</i>

53:50.021 --> 53:52.012
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

53:54.426 --> 53:56.894
<i>Dance</i>

53:57.062 --> 54:01.522
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

54:01.700 --> 54:03.895
<i>Midnight creeps so slowly</i>

54:04.069 --> 54:08.597
<i>Into hearts of men</i>
<i>Who need more than they get</i>

54:08.773 --> 54:11.071
<i>Daylight deals a bad hand</i>

54:11.242 --> 54:15.941
<i>To a penguin who has laid too many bets</i>

54:16.114 --> 54:19.515
<i>The mirror stares you in the face</i>

54:19.684 --> 54:22.881
<i>And says, "Baby... it don't work"</i>

54:23.054 --> 54:26.581
<i>You say your prayers</i>
<i>Though you don't care</i>

54:26.758 --> 54:29.727
<i>You dance and shake the hurt</i>

54:29.894 --> 54:31.259
<i>Dance!</i>

54:31.429 --> 54:32.521
Mumble!

54:32.697 --> 54:36.895
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

54:37.068 --> 54:38.968
<i>Dance, dance, dance</i>

54:39.137 --> 54:40.297
<i>Mumble</i>

54:40.472 --> 54:42.599
<i>Boogie wonderland</i>

54:42.774 --> 54:45.299
<i>Check it out, check it out</i>
<i>Check it out, check it out</i>

54:47.312 --> 54:48.870
<i>My brothers</i>

54:56.222 --> 54:59.123
<i>You look so beautiful to me, baby</i>

55:08.668 --> 55:10.363
- Mumble.
- Hey, Miss Viola.

55:10.536 --> 55:16.168
<i>- All the love in the world can't be gone</i>
<i>- Mumble!</i>

55:16.342 --> 55:21.302
<i>- All the need to be loved can't be wrong</i>
<i>- Mumble!</i>

55:21.480 --> 55:23.038
Disgraceful!

55:24.717 --> 55:26.446
Who do they think they are?

55:26.619 --> 55:30.214
Where is Noah?
This is getting out of hand.

55:30.589 --> 55:32.181
Go!

55:36.462 --> 55:38.862
Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble.

55:39.432 --> 55:42.265
- Mumble?
- Mumble?

55:42.435 --> 55:45.927
No, no. No, it's "Mambo." O!

55:46.105 --> 55:49.563
Baby. They're saying, "Mumble."

56:10.963 --> 56:11.987
Boogie!

56:12.264 --> 56:13.458
Behold, Noah, look!

56:13.632 --> 56:19.628
This was an omen from the start
and now we have this uprising.

56:19.805 --> 56:23.332
Stop! Stop!

56:23.509 --> 56:27.309
Stop this unruly nonsense!

56:29.482 --> 56:31.950
Stop it right now!

56:33.185 --> 56:35.619
A little self-control, if you please!

56:35.788 --> 56:40.487
You bring this disorder, this aberration,
to the very heart of our community.

56:40.659 --> 56:41.921
Have you lost your minds?

56:42.094 --> 56:43.857
- We're just having fun.
- Harmless fun.

56:44.029 --> 56:48.261
"Harmless"? It is this kind of backsliding
that has brought the scarcity upon us.

56:48.434 --> 56:50.959
Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak
plain penguin, please?

56:51.137 --> 56:53.799
He thinks the food shortage
has something to do with me.

56:53.973 --> 56:57.637
Do you not understand that we can
only survive here when we're in harmony?

56:57.811 --> 57:01.042
When you and your foreign friends
lead us into your easy ways...

57:01.214 --> 57:02.841
...you offend the Great 'Guin.

57:03.016 --> 57:04.950
You invite him to withhold his bounty.

57:05.118 --> 57:08.713
- He rules the seasons.
- He giveth and he can taketh away.

57:08.889 --> 57:11.380
Wait a minute.
Happy feet can't cause a famine.

57:11.558 --> 57:15.153
If thy kind of pagan display
did not cause it, then what did?

57:15.328 --> 57:17.626
I think it comes from outside.
Way beyond the ice.

57:17.798 --> 57:20.130
There are things out there,
things we don't understand.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.961
- Mysteries.
- Mind-boggling mysteries.

57:22.135 --> 57:23.534
- Mystic beings.
- Yeah, aliens.

57:23.703 --> 57:25.330
- He's mad.
- No, aliens.

57:25.505 --> 57:27.166
- I hear they're smart.
- He's insane.

57:27.340 --> 57:29.968
No, they might be smarter than all of us.
Who knows?

57:30.143 --> 57:32.543
He drove the fish away,
now he's ranting this rubbish!

57:32.712 --> 57:35.977
- Hey, let me tell something to you.
- Don't touch me, you filthy vermin.

57:36.149 --> 57:37.980
- Hey, watch it.
- And so it follows.

57:38.151 --> 57:41.643
Dissent leads to division
and division leads us to doom.

57:41.822 --> 57:44.882
- You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go.
- Hear, hear.

57:45.058 --> 57:47.492
Don't you take one step, sweetheart.

57:47.661 --> 57:51.153
You have as much right to be here
as any of these daffy old fools.

57:51.998 --> 57:54.592
Norma Jean, I'll deal with this.

57:54.768 --> 57:56.235
Pa?

57:58.605 --> 58:01.597
Mumble, you must renounce
your so-called friends...

58:01.775 --> 58:03.800
...your peculiar thoughts,
your strange ways.

58:03.977 --> 58:05.342
- Memphis.
- If we are devout...

58:05.512 --> 58:07.639
...sincere in our praise,
the fish will return.

58:07.814 --> 58:11.079
- But, Pa...
- Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself.

58:11.251 --> 58:13.515
I was careless
and now we're paying the price.

58:13.687 --> 58:15.279
What's this got to do with Mumble?

58:15.455 --> 58:18.390
- It's why he is the way he is.
- There's nothing wrong with him!

58:18.558 --> 58:21.618
- Face it, our son's all messed up.
- He's not messed up, hear me?

58:21.795 --> 58:23.763
- Believe me, I know.
- How can you say that?

58:23.930 --> 58:27.024
Because when he was just an egg,
I dropped him!

58:27.200 --> 58:28.963
Memphis.

58:30.804 --> 58:32.362
Mumble.

58:34.674 --> 58:37.234
Oh, my poor little Mumble.

58:37.410 --> 58:39.071
But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine.

58:39.246 --> 58:41.237
- No. No, you're not, boy.
- That's right.

58:41.414 --> 58:44.975
For all our sakes, you must stop
this freakiness with the feet.

58:45.151 --> 58:49.281
Your father speaks wisely.
Heed his suffering heart and repent.

58:49.456 --> 58:51.651
But it just doesn't make any sense.

58:51.825 --> 58:53.884
Then your arrogance leaves us no choice!

58:54.060 --> 58:55.049
No, wait.

58:56.062 --> 59:00.328
Please, son, you can do this.
It ain't so hard.

59:02.269 --> 59:05.933
Don't ask me to change, Pa,
because I can't.

59:10.249 --> 59:14.151
And that, my brethren, is the end of it.

59:14.320 --> 59:16.220
You, begone!

59:19.158 --> 59:22.457
- Mumble.
- No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

59:23.696 --> 59:26.358
Let me tell something to you.

59:26.532 --> 59:28.659
When I find out
what's happening to the fish...

59:29.535 --> 59:31.332
...I'll be back.

59:32.171 --> 59:33.798
Let me through? Let me through.

59:33.973 --> 59:36.066
- Mumble, you don't have to go.
- Let it be.

59:36.242 --> 59:38.710
- Gloria.
- No. No, Dad, this isn't fair.

59:38.878 --> 59:41.108
Gloria, listen to your father.

59:41.614 --> 59:47.177
<i>My folks were always putting him down</i>

59:47.353 --> 59:50.220
<i>Down, down, down</i>

59:50.389 --> 59:54.655
<i>They said he came</i>
<i>From the wrong side of town</i>

59:54.827 --> 59:58.319
<i>He came from the wrong side of town</i>

59:58.498 --> 1:00:01.592
<i>They told me he was bad</i>

1:00:01.768 --> 1:00:02.860
<i>So bad</i>

1:00:03.035 --> 1:00:06.971
<i>- But I know he was sad</i>
<i>- So sad</i>

1:00:07.140 --> 1:00:12.305
<i>I'll never forget him</i>
<i>The leader of the pack</i>

1:00:12.478 --> 1:00:16.312
We sing the heart
of our true friend, Mumble.

1:00:16.482 --> 1:00:22.478
You are a nation of peeny-weeny,
piffling, <i>piccolini,</i> piddly-diddly pouft!

1:00:23.723 --> 1:00:25.623
Together, we prevail.

1:00:25.792 --> 1:00:27.657
In the wisdoms, we trust.

1:00:27.827 --> 1:00:29.761
We trust.

1:00:31.898 --> 1:00:34.731
<i>Look out</i>

1:00:34.901 --> 1:00:39.429
<i>Look out</i>

1:00:40.239 --> 1:00:43.208
<i>Look out</i>

1:00:43.376 --> 1:00:48.006
<i>Look</i>

1:00:48.181 --> 1:00:52.277
<i>Look out</i>

1:00:55.955 --> 1:01:00.153
Don't worry, tall guy.
My father also called me a pitiful loser.

1:01:00.326 --> 1:01:01.452
Look how I turn out.

1:01:01.627 --> 1:01:02.821
You're not helping, Ramon.

1:01:02.995 --> 1:01:06.692
He gonna be okay. All he gotta do
is find out what happened to the fish.

1:01:06.866 --> 1:01:08.834
- How he gonna do that?
- He think of something.

1:01:09.001 --> 1:01:10.992
- The aliens.
- What?

1:01:11.170 --> 1:01:14.004
- I'm gonna talk to the aliens.
- How you gonna find aliens?

1:01:14.174 --> 1:01:16.734
- Lovelace.
- He don't like you. He don't like you at all.

1:01:16.910 --> 1:01:19.003
That's okay. I'll appeal
to his better nature.

1:01:19.179 --> 1:01:21.647
- How you gonna do that?
- Cruel and unusual punishment?

1:01:21.815 --> 1:01:24.306
- Unimaginable torture?
- Imaginable torture?

1:01:24.484 --> 1:01:26.679
- Your singing?
- No!

1:01:26.854 --> 1:01:29.186
<i>"Can anybody find me"...</i>

1:01:29.590 --> 1:01:32.252
- You're cracking the ice!
- Avalanche!

1:01:32.426 --> 1:01:34.087
Yes, okay. Thank you.

1:01:44.504 --> 1:01:47.405
Lovelace. You there?

1:01:47.574 --> 1:01:49.701
Lovelace!

1:01:52.579 --> 1:01:54.376
Lovelace.

1:01:59.419 --> 1:02:01.046
Lovelace?

1:02:01.221 --> 1:02:02.552
Is this a bad time?

1:02:02.723 --> 1:02:04.657
I know we don't have
an appointment, but...

1:02:04.825 --> 1:02:06.952
Just one question and
I want a straight answer.

1:02:07.127 --> 1:02:08.719
Where do I find the mystic beings?

1:02:11.565 --> 1:02:13.556
Why don't he speak?

1:02:15.569 --> 1:02:18.197
Lovelace, you okay?

1:02:19.673 --> 1:02:22.870
- Boy, he's possessed.
- It's a seizure! It's a seizure!

1:02:23.043 --> 1:02:24.510
- Open the beak.
- Grab his tongue.

1:02:24.678 --> 1:02:27.272
He's choking. That thing
around his neck, it's too tight.

1:02:27.447 --> 1:02:30.075
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- On three.

1:02:30.250 --> 1:02:34.516
Stop! Listen! No! Amigos! Amigos! Stop!

1:02:34.688 --> 1:02:36.679
- What?
- You're hurting him.

1:02:38.759 --> 1:02:40.226
Any better?

1:02:40.394 --> 1:02:42.919
Lovelace, how did you get
that thing around your neck?

1:02:43.096 --> 1:02:46.429
- It was bestowed on him.
- By the mystic beings.

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.761
- They didn't bestow it?
- No.

1:02:48.936 --> 1:02:51.928
Oh, come on, he don't know
what he's saying.

1:02:52.105 --> 1:02:55.097
You were swimming
and it just got caught around your neck.

1:02:55.275 --> 1:02:58.176
Oh, no way. He the guru.

1:02:59.179 --> 1:03:02.376
Lovelace, did you ever actually meet
a mystic being?

1:03:03.116 --> 1:03:04.743
Officially?

1:03:06.219 --> 1:03:07.208
No.

1:03:07.387 --> 1:03:09.321
I knew it! It's all a lie.

1:03:09.489 --> 1:03:11.354
But this belongs to someone.

1:03:11.525 --> 1:03:14.221
If we could find them,
I bet you they could take it off.

1:03:14.628 --> 1:03:18.861
Show me where you found it. I'm sure
they could help us. You and me both.

1:03:21.703 --> 1:03:23.603
Two words, three syllables.

1:03:23.771 --> 1:03:25.568
- What is it?
- You're dying?

1:03:25.740 --> 1:03:29.437
No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life.

1:03:29.610 --> 1:03:31.202
You're passing gas.

1:03:32.613 --> 1:03:34.604
Now he thinks he's an elephant seal.

1:03:34.782 --> 1:03:36.716
No, no, no. Go over the mountains.

1:03:36.884 --> 1:03:39.819
- Go over the mountains!
- Through the land of the elephant seals.

1:03:39.988 --> 1:03:44.584
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals.
- Beyond the land of the elephant seals!

1:03:55.536 --> 1:03:57.697
- Wait.
- What?

1:03:58.606 --> 1:04:00.597
I hear voices.

1:04:00.775 --> 1:04:02.436
- There is a voice.
- Where?

1:04:02.610 --> 1:04:06.171
- There's a little voice on the wind.
- Mumble!

1:04:06.347 --> 1:04:07.644
- "Mambo"?
- "Mambo"?

1:04:07.815 --> 1:04:09.248
- Listen.
- Mumble Happy Feet.

1:04:09.784 --> 1:04:11.012
- Gloria?
- Gloria!

1:04:11.185 --> 1:04:12.174
Gloria?

1:04:12.353 --> 1:04:14.878
Hey, you got a stalker.
She's obsessed with you, man.

1:04:18.493 --> 1:04:20.961
I can't believe it's you.

1:04:21.129 --> 1:04:23.188
Of course it's me.

1:04:24.499 --> 1:04:26.194
What are you doing here?

1:04:26.367 --> 1:04:29.564
<i>All the love in the world can't be gone</i>

1:04:29.737 --> 1:04:33.605
<i>All the need to be loved can't be wrong</i>

1:04:33.775 --> 1:04:36.505
- Oh, my.
- So which way, twinkletoes?

1:04:36.677 --> 1:04:40.044
No, no, no. If you come,
you may never get back home.

1:04:40.214 --> 1:04:41.579
Fine by me.

1:04:41.749 --> 1:04:47.210
Gloria, you have a life back there.
I don't. I mean, we don't. Not out here.

1:04:47.388 --> 1:04:50.482
How can we keep an egg safe?
That's if we ever had an egg.

1:04:50.658 --> 1:04:53.252
Well, I don't need an egg to be happy.

1:04:53.428 --> 1:04:57.455
You say that now, but what about later
when all your friends have eggs?

1:04:58.833 --> 1:05:00.061
Then I'll have you.

1:05:01.502 --> 1:05:04.903
Now he's going to pledge
his soul forever.

1:05:05.073 --> 1:05:06.199
- Gloria.
- Here it comes.

1:05:06.374 --> 1:05:13.303
I'm a particular kind of guy,
the kind of guy who needs his own space.

1:05:13.581 --> 1:05:15.446
It's not you, it's me.

1:05:15.616 --> 1:05:18.050
I'm just not up for a serious relationship
right now.

1:05:18.219 --> 1:05:21.552
What he's trying to do now
is he's pushing her away. Let's watch.

1:05:21.722 --> 1:05:25.214
No matter what you say or do,
you're stuck with me.

1:05:25.393 --> 1:05:28.488
Oh, come on. As if you're not
totally thrilled that I'm here.

1:05:28.664 --> 1:05:32.122
- Now she got him on the ropes.
- See, right there is your problem.

1:05:32.301 --> 1:05:34.201
You think you're irresistible, don't you?

1:05:34.369 --> 1:05:36.701
I don't care where you're from,
that's got to hurt.

1:05:36.872 --> 1:05:39.602
- Excuse me?
- Gloria's so gorgeous, Gloria's so talented.

1:05:39.775 --> 1:05:40.764
What?

1:05:40.943 --> 1:05:43.343
Just because
you can hit a few high notes.

1:05:43.512 --> 1:05:45.639
You got a problem with my singing?

1:05:45.814 --> 1:05:48.044
No, it's perfectly fine.

1:05:48.217 --> 1:05:50.082
- "Fine"?
- If you like that sort of thing.

1:05:50.252 --> 1:05:52.846
- It's a little Nana Tootsie for my taste.
- What?

1:05:53.021 --> 1:05:55.148
You know, showy, flashy, froufrou.

1:05:55.324 --> 1:05:56.814
- "Froufrou"?
- That's right.

1:05:56.992 --> 1:06:01.122
Coming from someone who thinks it's cool
to jig up and down really fast on the spot...

1:06:01.296 --> 1:06:03.560
...like some twitchy idiot.

1:06:07.336 --> 1:06:09.964
You stubborn, hippity-hoppity fool!

1:06:10.139 --> 1:06:12.004
Right back at you.

1:06:22.351 --> 1:06:24.842
Amigo, that was a good thing you do.

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.284
She is going to be so much better off
without you.

1:06:27.456 --> 1:06:30.584
She is going to find a good, steady guy
to comfort her...

1:06:30.759 --> 1:06:33.956
...and love her up real good
and raise a big family.

1:06:34.129 --> 1:06:36.359
- Ramon.
- And then she's going to let herself go...

1:06:36.532 --> 1:06:39.660
Ramon. He's hurting. He's hurting bad.

1:06:39.835 --> 1:06:44.499
Oh, listen, listen, don't hold it in
or you explode. You got to let it out.

1:06:44.673 --> 1:06:47.369
You just let it out. You let it out.

1:06:47.543 --> 1:06:50.410
Everybody, turn away for a moment.

1:06:50.579 --> 1:06:52.877
<i>If she leave him now</i>

1:06:53.048 --> 1:06:58.247
<i>She take away the biggest part of him</i>

1:07:00.622 --> 1:07:02.556
<i>Don't, baby, please, don't go</i>

1:07:02.724 --> 1:07:04.589
Please, guys.

1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:06.751
No more singing.

1:07:17.339 --> 1:07:20.001
Then she say to me, "Enough,
you are making me nauseous."

1:07:20.175 --> 1:07:23.906
So I become silent, almost moody,
and you know what she says?

1:07:24.079 --> 1:07:26.138
"You never share. You got to let it out."

1:07:26.315 --> 1:07:29.079
- Ramon, come on.
- Let it out. Let it out.

1:07:29.251 --> 1:07:30.684
Stop it! Let it go.

1:07:30.852 --> 1:07:34.516
- I never had a good relationship in my life.
- Give him a hug. Give him a hug.

1:07:34.691 --> 1:07:35.919
- I let it out!
- There we go.

1:07:36.092 --> 1:07:38.652
- I let it out.
- I know. Get over it.

1:07:38.828 --> 1:07:41.626
- Can you keep going?
- Yeah.

1:07:41.798 --> 1:07:44.995
- What's that smell?
- It wasn't me.

1:07:46.135 --> 1:07:49.901
Hey, Fluffy, we're following you.
Get up here.

1:07:58.047 --> 1:08:02.108
So these elephant seals,
they're not penguin eaters, are they?

1:08:02.285 --> 1:08:04.685
I don't know.
I believe they are herbivores.

1:08:04.854 --> 1:08:06.719
- What?
- You know, kelp-suckers.

1:08:06.889 --> 1:08:09.221
Here we go, Lovelace. Come on.

1:08:10.893 --> 1:08:12.758
Jump in time. Jump in time.

1:08:12.929 --> 1:08:15.693
- Okay, let's do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. Ready?

1:08:18.901 --> 1:08:21.301
I can do this. I can do this.
I got to trick myself.

1:08:21.471 --> 1:08:23.371
Boy, look at that. What?

1:08:39.322 --> 1:08:43.884
You blokes better be lost,
because trespassing's a crime.

1:08:44.060 --> 1:08:48.053
- We're just passing through.
- Yeah. We're with him.

1:08:48.665 --> 1:08:51.133
You wouldn't be heading
over them distant hills...

1:08:51.301 --> 1:08:53.235
...and through the blizzard country?

1:08:53.403 --> 1:08:56.201
If it's the only way
to the forbidden shore, yeah.

1:08:56.372 --> 1:08:57.566
Crikey.

1:08:57.740 --> 1:09:01.232
You might come face to face
with an annihilator.

1:09:01.411 --> 1:09:02.435
An alien annihilator?

1:09:02.612 --> 1:09:05.547
Too right. Cut you up
as soon as look at you.

1:09:05.715 --> 1:09:08.741
Waste every living thing in their path.

1:09:08.918 --> 1:09:10.579
Could they be annihilating the fish?

1:09:10.753 --> 1:09:12.345
Every living thing.

1:09:12.522 --> 1:09:14.990
Merciless, mate. Merciless.

1:09:15.158 --> 1:09:17.456
Even if you're a whopping great whale...

1:09:17.627 --> 1:09:20.289
...they drag your sorry carcass ashore...

1:09:20.463 --> 1:09:26.163
...dice you up, melt you down,
and turn you into fun food.

1:09:26.336 --> 1:09:28.600
One day you're a big old whale...

1:09:28.771 --> 1:09:31.069
...next minute...

1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:32.639
...fun food.

1:09:32.809 --> 1:09:34.242
Someone's gotta stop them.

1:09:34.410 --> 1:09:36.901
Oh, yeah? What's gonna be
your approach?

1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:39.105
If I could just talk to them.

1:09:39.282 --> 1:09:40.773
Appeal to their better nature.

1:09:40.951 --> 1:09:41.940
Beauty.

1:09:42.119 --> 1:09:47.716
When that crafty little trick pays off,
you be sure to let us know, won't you?

1:09:47.891 --> 1:09:50.758
All right, Lovelace, let's go.

1:09:52.996 --> 1:09:55.089
See you, Lovelace.

1:09:57.534 --> 1:09:59.968
Your funeral, mate.

1:10:47.785 --> 1:10:50.345
Oh, man!

1:10:51.388 --> 1:10:54.118
- Push tight.
- Okay.

1:11:08.772 --> 1:11:10.933
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1:11:11.108 --> 1:11:15.010
You can do it. Come on, push!

1:11:59.257 --> 1:12:01.282
What's that noise?

1:12:02.827 --> 1:12:04.021
There's no noise.

1:12:04.195 --> 1:12:06.755
- No gasping. No wheezing.
- Where's Lovelace?

1:12:08.833 --> 1:12:13.600
Sometimes a brave penguin
will just slip away to die.

1:12:13.771 --> 1:12:15.705
Do you think he went to a happy place?

1:12:15.874 --> 1:12:19.469
- Probably.
- No, no. I think he went this way.

1:12:31.523 --> 1:12:34.014
Come on. Let's go.

1:12:50.608 --> 1:12:52.508
Lovelace!

1:12:53.678 --> 1:12:56.169
Lovelace!

1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:04.051
Hello?

1:13:05.456 --> 1:13:06.855
Is there anyone there?

1:13:07.025 --> 1:13:10.620
- No... No need to shout.
- Somebody might hear you.

1:13:16.267 --> 1:13:18.030
His feet don't look too good.

1:13:18.202 --> 1:13:20.796
- He rested here.
- Now he's on his belly!

1:13:20.972 --> 1:13:23.532
- No, this way.
- You don't want to know what he did here.

1:13:23.708 --> 1:13:25.938
- You're right.
- There he is. Lovelace!

1:13:26.110 --> 1:13:29.409
- All right! Lovelace!
- Lovelace!

1:13:32.183 --> 1:13:33.946
- Oh, look at Lovelace.
- We're here.

1:13:34.118 --> 1:13:37.679
- Are you okay?
- Come on, man. Hang in there, buddy.

1:13:38.556 --> 1:13:40.183
What is it?

1:13:40.358 --> 1:13:43.623
Oh, look. There's one for everyone.

1:13:43.795 --> 1:13:46.320
Hang in there, Lovelace.
I know they're here somewhere.

1:13:46.497 --> 1:13:49.022
- Why would they leave all this behind?
- I don't know.

1:13:50.034 --> 1:13:51.023
Hey.

1:13:51.202 --> 1:13:53.466
- Tell them we come in peace.
- We come in peace!

1:13:53.638 --> 1:13:55.162
- Lovelace.
- Lovelace.

1:13:55.341 --> 1:13:56.808
- Lovelace.
- Oh, buddy, come on.

1:13:56.976 --> 1:13:59.035
- Are you okay?
- Hang in there, buddy.

1:14:01.647 --> 1:14:04.115
- Oh, that's not good.
- Stay calm.

1:14:04.283 --> 1:14:05.580
- Stay calm.
- That's not good.

1:14:05.751 --> 1:14:08.345
- Okay, don't stay calm!
- Panic!

1:14:15.060 --> 1:14:17.028
Oh, no, no!

1:14:19.064 --> 1:14:22.158
- Oh, they're making us appe-teasers.
- They're appe-teasing us!

1:14:22.334 --> 1:14:24.461
We're all gonna die.

1:14:25.738 --> 1:14:27.603
Whatever you do, stay out of the water!

1:14:27.773 --> 1:14:29.900
- Stay out of the water.
- Don't go in the water!

1:14:30.075 --> 1:14:32.771
Lovelace, don't go in the water!

1:14:38.617 --> 1:14:40.141
Lovelace, hang in there!

1:14:40.319 --> 1:14:42.219
Hang in there!

1:14:43.589 --> 1:14:46.581
Get your dirty tongue off him!

1:14:48.994 --> 1:14:50.894
No, no, no!

1:14:51.063 --> 1:14:52.530
Stay out of the water!

1:14:52.698 --> 1:14:54.393
- Mumble!
- Mumble!

1:15:24.663 --> 1:15:29.259
- They playing birdminton?
- No, it's a show. Dinner and a show.

1:15:32.905 --> 1:15:35.465
Lovelace!

1:15:40.979 --> 1:15:42.970
Rejoice!

1:15:51.390 --> 1:15:52.584
Lovelace!

1:15:52.758 --> 1:15:54.817
- Help!
- Reach out!

1:15:54.993 --> 1:15:56.824
Thank you, my brother, thank you!

1:16:07.807 --> 1:16:09.672
I wasn't scared! I wasn't scared!

1:16:10.477 --> 1:16:14.413
Oh, my beautiful brother, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!

1:16:18.585 --> 1:16:21.554
- Go, Lovelace! You the man!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

1:16:21.721 --> 1:16:24.189
Enough!

1:16:24.357 --> 1:16:26.450
It's a bad day for you!

1:16:26.626 --> 1:16:28.685
You dealing with Lovelace now!

1:16:28.862 --> 1:16:31.524
- And my man, Mumble, here.
- You tell them, Lovelace.

1:16:31.698 --> 1:16:34.462
Begone, demon fish. Adios.

1:16:35.869 --> 1:16:37.496
That's right.

1:16:37.670 --> 1:16:39.433
You hightail it back to your mamas.

1:16:39.739 --> 1:16:41.798
- How did he do that?
- Don't make me come in the water.

1:16:41.975 --> 1:16:43.909
I'll come after your sons and daughters.

1:16:44.077 --> 1:16:46.068
I'm gonna give you the bad eye.

1:17:40.366 --> 1:17:41.697
A whole bunch of them.

1:17:41.868 --> 1:17:44.496
They gonna rule the world.

1:17:44.671 --> 1:17:45.660
It's gotta be them.

1:17:45.839 --> 1:17:49.104
- If it is, I don't wanna know about it.
- They don't even know we exist.

1:17:49.275 --> 1:17:50.606
Let me tell something to you.

1:17:50.777 --> 1:17:53.769
This is the end of the road. It's over.

1:17:53.947 --> 1:17:56.848
You did everything penguinly possible.

1:17:57.016 --> 1:17:59.484
- You found the aliens.
- We gonna testify to that.

1:17:59.652 --> 1:18:03.019
We'll tell your whole laughing-boy nation
they were dead wrong about you.

1:18:03.189 --> 1:18:04.986
Now, let's all go back home. Right now.

1:18:05.158 --> 1:18:06.523
Right on.

1:18:06.693 --> 1:18:08.285
- Could I ask a favor of you?
- Sure.

1:18:08.461 --> 1:18:11.022
- What kind of favor?
- Could you make sure Gloria's okay?

1:18:11.198 --> 1:18:12.563
- And my ma.
- What?

1:18:12.733 --> 1:18:14.325
And if you see Pa...

1:18:14.501 --> 1:18:17.368
...tell him I tried.

1:18:17.538 --> 1:18:19.028
Okay, what you talking about?

1:18:19.206 --> 1:18:20.969
I'm gonna stop them taking our fish.

1:18:21.141 --> 1:18:22.699
How you gonna do that, Mumble?

1:18:25.079 --> 1:18:28.139
Adios, amigos!

1:18:28.482 --> 1:18:29.972
Amigo! He did it.

1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:54.564
You believe that?

1:18:54.742 --> 1:18:58.303
How we gonna tell his mama
he bring us all this way just to kill himself?

1:18:58.479 --> 1:19:01.243
No. He didn't. Look.

1:19:02.082 --> 1:19:03.845
He loco maniac.

1:19:04.018 --> 1:19:06.953
First ever flying flipper bird.

1:19:07.121 --> 1:19:09.282
How tall you think that tall boy was?

1:19:09.456 --> 1:19:12.619
Who could say? Taller than anyone.

1:19:12.793 --> 1:19:16.729
Hey, it's me, Lovelace...

1:19:16.897 --> 1:19:19.297
...formerly known as "guru."

1:19:19.466 --> 1:19:22.458
I'm gonna be telling your story,
Happy Feet...

1:19:22.636 --> 1:19:26.504
...long after you dead and gone!

1:19:43.524 --> 1:19:45.788
Hey! Hey!

1:20:35.944 --> 1:20:38.640
<i>Enraged by their indifference...</i>

1:20:38.813 --> 1:20:44.149
<i>... he followed them long after</i>
<i>they were gone from his sight.</i>

1:20:46.321 --> 1:20:50.553
<i>He ventured further</i>
<i>than any of us had gone before...</i>

1:20:50.725 --> 1:20:54.559
<i>... beyond all hope of return.</i>

1:20:55.497 --> 1:20:57.931
<i>Swept up by the great currents...</i>

1:20:58.099 --> 1:21:02.763
<i>... he was carried endlessly</i>
<i>across vast oceans...</i>

1:21:02.937 --> 1:21:06.634
<i>... to worlds unknown.</i>

1:22:02.931 --> 1:22:05.695
Excuse me. What is this place?

1:22:05.867 --> 1:22:08.859
You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven.

1:22:09.037 --> 1:22:11.028
Is it anywhere near Emperor Land?

1:22:11.206 --> 1:22:14.004
It's wherever you want it to be.

1:22:14.843 --> 1:22:18.870
Try the water, Dave. It's really real.

1:22:34.964 --> 1:22:39.333
<i>I heard tell,</i>
<i>when he finally saw aliens up close...</i>

1:22:39.502 --> 1:22:43.700
<i>... they were just as the skua</i>
<i>had described.</i>

1:22:43.873 --> 1:22:46.501
Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish?

1:22:46.675 --> 1:22:51.977
<i>Big, ugly penguins without feathers</i>
<i>on their fat, flabby faces.</i>

1:22:52.148 --> 1:22:57.882
Why are you taking our fish?
You're kind of killing us out there.

1:23:00.256 --> 1:23:02.349
No! No, wait!

1:23:11.967 --> 1:23:13.935
Oh, my.

1:23:15.004 --> 1:23:19.168
Hello. Hello from Emperor Land.
Good afternoon.

1:23:19.341 --> 1:23:21.104
Why are you taking our fish?

1:23:21.277 --> 1:23:25.714
I'm sure you don't mean to,
but you're causing an awful lot of grief.

1:23:26.715 --> 1:23:30.708
Am I not making myself clear?
I'm speaking plain penguin.

1:23:31.620 --> 1:23:35.181
Penguin! Don't you understand?
You're stealing our fish.

1:23:39.461 --> 1:23:42.191
Oh, please, anyone, talk to me!

1:23:42.364 --> 1:23:44.594
For pity's sake, you're stealing our F-l-S...

1:23:49.371 --> 1:23:54.138
<i>After three days, he would lose his voice.</i>

1:23:54.310 --> 1:23:56.744
<i>After three months...</i>

1:23:58.714 --> 1:24:02.844
<i>... he would all but lose his mind.</i>

1:24:15.264 --> 1:24:18.233
So you found the fish, baby.

1:24:19.335 --> 1:24:20.996
Ma?

1:24:21.170 --> 1:24:22.467
- Hi, sweetie.
- Ma.

1:24:22.638 --> 1:24:27.041
Fluffy, no matter what they say or do,
we never stopped believing in you.

1:24:27.209 --> 1:24:29.302
So you'll be back soon, right?

1:24:29.478 --> 1:24:31.105
Hey, come on. Let him eat.

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:33.272
Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us.

1:24:33.783 --> 1:24:35.250
But there's plenty for everyone.

1:24:35.418 --> 1:24:37.716
It's okay, sugar. We can wait.

1:24:37.887 --> 1:24:39.718
No, no, Ma! Ma!

1:24:39.889 --> 1:24:43.290
There's lots here. Ma!

1:24:47.230 --> 1:24:48.822
Ma!

1:27:09.039 --> 1:27:11.735
- Kids, you gotta see this.
- He's on now.

1:27:33.497 --> 1:27:35.863
Hey! Hello!

1:27:38.302 --> 1:27:40.862
- Isn't that the fellow with the wacky feet?
- Looks like.

1:27:41.038 --> 1:27:43.336
- What was his name?
- I thought he was dead.

1:27:43.507 --> 1:27:44.906
- Everybody...
- Apparently not.

1:27:45.075 --> 1:27:48.010
Everybody, listen up! I've got big news.

1:27:48.345 --> 1:27:50.336
I know who's taking the fish!

1:27:50.514 --> 1:27:52.982
- Yeah, and they took his brain.
- It's the aliens.

1:27:53.150 --> 1:27:55.414
- I made contact with them.
- The lunatic is back.

1:27:55.586 --> 1:27:57.577
The aliens are taking our fish.

1:27:57.755 --> 1:27:59.814
Someone ought to fetch
Noah and the elders.

1:27:59.990 --> 1:28:01.287
Hey, you.

1:28:01.859 --> 1:28:03.417
Gloria.

1:28:03.594 --> 1:28:05.687
Kind of weird, seeing you again.

1:28:06.197 --> 1:28:07.186
Yeah.

1:28:07.364 --> 1:28:09.730
- Everything cool here, baby?
- You remember Seymour.

1:28:09.900 --> 1:28:11.197
Yeah. Hi, Seymour.

1:28:11.368 --> 1:28:12.858
Yeah.

1:28:14.171 --> 1:28:15.900
So which one is yours?

1:28:17.141 --> 1:28:18.403
All of them.

1:28:20.778 --> 1:28:24.908
This is our singing class.
He teaches rhythm. I teach the blues.

1:28:25.082 --> 1:28:27.676
- So you're not...?
- I guess I never heard the right song.

1:28:27.852 --> 1:28:30.980
That's great! I didn't mean...

1:28:31.322 --> 1:28:32.914
I found out who's taking the fish.

1:28:33.090 --> 1:28:35.217
They're big and kind of ugly,
but, Gloria...

1:28:35.392 --> 1:28:37.690
...the things they can do.
They're coming here.

1:28:37.862 --> 1:28:38.988
Oh, is that so?

1:28:39.163 --> 1:28:41.563
They'll be here soon.
I think they wanna help us.

1:28:41.732 --> 1:28:43.461
So now you speak with them?

1:28:43.634 --> 1:28:46.832
Well, they don't speak penguin,
but they seem to respond to this.

1:28:47.005 --> 1:28:49.064
- What's he doing?
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:28:49.241 --> 1:28:52.267
I suggest we all do it.
It really gets their attention.

1:28:52.444 --> 1:28:53.775
And why would it do that?

1:28:53.945 --> 1:28:56.846
Beats me, but it works.

1:28:57.015 --> 1:28:59.882
- Hey, it's the hippity-hopper.
- Freaky feet!

1:29:00.051 --> 1:29:01.040
Boys, boys...

1:29:01.219 --> 1:29:02.208
- Fluffy.
- Tall guy.

1:29:02.387 --> 1:29:04.378
- Stretch!
- Amigo!

1:29:07.993 --> 1:29:10.860
So you dare come back?

1:29:11.162 --> 1:29:13.756
He says he's found aliens
and they're taking our fish.

1:29:13.932 --> 1:29:16.457
He says that they're coming
and we all have to do this.

1:29:17.936 --> 1:29:21.463
There be no such thing as aliens!

1:29:23.575 --> 1:29:26.305
Mumble, turn around.

1:29:29.447 --> 1:29:30.937
It's a disease.

1:29:31.349 --> 1:29:33.044
Is that from them?

1:29:33.752 --> 1:29:37.916
Yeah. But don't be afraid.
I think it's a way to find me, that's all.

1:29:38.089 --> 1:29:41.786
You led them here?
You turned them on your own kind?

1:29:42.594 --> 1:29:46.496
Wait a second, you just said
there's no such thing as aliens.

1:29:48.934 --> 1:29:51.061
Well, there's not.

1:29:51.236 --> 1:29:54.865
But if there were, only a traitorous fool
would bring them here.

1:29:55.040 --> 1:29:56.132
But they have to come.

1:29:56.308 --> 1:29:59.277
They're the ones taking our fish.
They can do something about it.

1:29:59.444 --> 1:30:02.936
None but the Great 'Guin
has the power to give and take away.

1:30:03.114 --> 1:30:07.574
The Great 'Guin didn't put things
out of whack, the aliens did.

1:30:08.153 --> 1:30:12.089
A fool returns this day
to mock our suffering.

1:30:12.257 --> 1:30:16.387
We are starving
and he wants us to hippity-hop.

1:30:16.561 --> 1:30:19.496
So do we hold fast to our ways...

1:30:19.664 --> 1:30:24.363
...or do we bend to the fetid fantasies
of a dancing fool?

1:30:33.178 --> 1:30:35.874
Say, how does that feet thing go again?

1:30:36.047 --> 1:30:37.605
Yeah, show us, Mumble.

1:30:38.984 --> 1:30:41.043
Oh, it's really quite easy.

1:30:41.219 --> 1:30:42.846
No, no!

1:30:43.021 --> 1:30:44.352
No, you must resist!

1:30:45.190 --> 1:30:46.885
That's right.

1:30:47.258 --> 1:30:50.625
- Pointless nonsense.
- Resist! Stand your ground!

1:30:50.795 --> 1:30:54.129
Stand your ground against this folly!

1:30:59.905 --> 1:31:02.965
Raise your voices, brothers.

1:31:03.142 --> 1:31:06.441
Cry out in defiance of this jiggity-joggity!

1:31:06.612 --> 1:31:08.739
Show me what you got.

1:31:11.550 --> 1:31:13.279
You got it.

1:31:17.823 --> 1:31:19.256
Come on.

1:31:19.425 --> 1:31:20.756
Work, work it.

1:31:20.926 --> 1:31:24.020
Yes, yes! Call on the wisdoms!

1:31:24.196 --> 1:31:25.925
Let the world tremble!

1:31:26.365 --> 1:31:28.230
For when all others leave...

1:31:28.401 --> 1:31:30.266
...we remain!

1:31:32.004 --> 1:31:33.631
Mumble! Mumble!

1:31:33.806 --> 1:31:36.604
Mama? Amigos.

1:31:37.977 --> 1:31:40.810
- Oh, Mama.
- Oh, my boy.

1:31:40.980 --> 1:31:43.574
- My gorgeous boy.
- Oh, Mama.

1:31:43.749 --> 1:31:45.876
- Look at him.
- You're so dazzling.

1:31:46.052 --> 1:31:48.919
- Oh, Fluffy.
- We waited and waited for you.

1:31:49.088 --> 1:31:51.921
- Oh, yeah.
- Where's Pa?

1:31:52.091 --> 1:31:54.355
Believe me. You don't wanna see
your deadbeat dad.

1:31:54.527 --> 1:31:56.586
- Your pa is sort of...
- What?

1:31:56.762 --> 1:31:59.060
Come on, I'll show you.

1:32:08.441 --> 1:32:10.238
Memphis?

1:32:11.277 --> 1:32:12.710
Memphis?

1:32:12.878 --> 1:32:14.368
Pa?

1:32:18.284 --> 1:32:19.911
Mumble?

1:32:20.086 --> 1:32:22.077
Is it truly you?

1:32:22.254 --> 1:32:24.586
Every last bit of me, Pa.

1:32:28.761 --> 1:32:30.592
I thought...

1:32:34.734 --> 1:32:36.224
Pa?

1:32:39.839 --> 1:32:42.239
There ain't been one day...

1:32:44.210 --> 1:32:48.840
...not one day, that I done right by you.

1:32:53.185 --> 1:32:55.210
Oh, Pa.

1:32:55.387 --> 1:32:57.252
Dance for him, Daddy.

1:32:57.423 --> 1:32:59.414
Dance with your boy.

1:33:02.763 --> 1:33:05.163
You'll have to forgive me.

1:33:05.966 --> 1:33:09.026
The music's gone clean out of me.

1:33:10.904 --> 1:33:12.496
No, it hasn't.

1:33:12.672 --> 1:33:16.472
It's just like singing with your body.

1:33:16.643 --> 1:33:18.668
Come on, baby. We can do it.

1:33:18.845 --> 1:33:20.403
Oh, Mama.

1:33:20.580 --> 1:33:24.949
It's just one big old foot after the other.

1:33:30.357 --> 1:33:31.346
That's it.

1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:35.191
Yeah.

1:33:36.563 --> 1:33:39.396
- Yeah, see?
- Well, that feels good.

1:33:44.638 --> 1:33:48.074
<i>You don't have to be beautiful</i>

1:33:48.508 --> 1:33:49.497
Yeah, Memphis.

1:33:49.743 --> 1:33:51.370
<i>To turn me on</i>

1:33:51.845 --> 1:33:52.834
Daddy.

1:33:53.013 --> 1:33:57.040
<i>I just need your body, baby</i>

1:33:57.217 --> 1:33:59.708
<i>From dusk till dawn</i>

1:34:00.921 --> 1:34:04.652
<i>You don't have to be rich to be my girl</i>

1:34:04.825 --> 1:34:08.818
<i>You don't have to be cool</i>
<i>To rule my world</i>

1:34:08.951 --> 1:34:12.853
<i>Ain't no particular song</i>
<i>I'm more compatible with</i>

1:34:13.022 --> 1:34:17.686
<i>I just want your extra time and your...</i>

1:34:38.014 --> 1:34:41.040
Holy flock!

1:35:06.442 --> 1:35:08.876
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

1:35:45.548 --> 1:35:47.914
I think you better dance now.

1:36:41.470 --> 1:36:43.938
First, there was just one.
Now there's thousands.

1:36:44.106 --> 1:36:46.802
- Are they trying to tell us something?
- What's the problem?

1:36:46.976 --> 1:36:49.774
- We're messing with their food chain.
- We've gotta do something.

1:36:49.946 --> 1:36:53.643
- We suggest a ban on all marine harvesting.
- Too much money. Too many jobs.

1:36:55.551 --> 1:36:57.712
Why should we do anything at all?

1:37:03.426 --> 1:37:06.793
They're just a bunch of flightless birds
at the bottom of the world.

1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:13.632
I don't wanna live in a world
without penguins.

1:37:13.803 --> 1:37:15.168
What are we gonna do about it?

1:37:15.338 --> 1:37:16.999
Bang up the sign "No Fishing."

1:37:18.774 --> 1:37:22.175
Is equal to the love...

1:37:22.345 --> 1:37:23.744
...you make.

1:37:27.817 --> 1:37:31.981
<i>Oh, baby. Right on.</i>

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:49.631
<i>Looking back on when I</i>
<i>Was a little nappy-headed boy</i>

1:37:52.475 --> 1:37:53.942
<i>It's like a jungle sometimes</i>

1:37:54.110 --> 1:37:56.305
<i>It makes me wonder</i>
<i>How I keep from going under</i>

1:37:58.247 --> 1:37:59.714
Bring it on! Go ahead!

1:38:00.583 --> 1:38:04.576
<i>Even though we sometimes</i>
<i>Would not get a thing</i>

1:38:04.754 --> 1:38:08.622
<i>We were happy with</i>
<i>The joy the day would bring</i>

1:38:08.791 --> 1:38:11.954
<i>I wish those days</i>
<i>Would come back once more</i>

1:38:12.128 --> 1:38:16.326
<i>Come back those days, those days</i>
<i>Come back, don't go</i>

1:38:16.732 --> 1:38:19.394
Come here, babe. Come on back.

1:38:19.568 --> 1:38:20.557
<i>Come on back</i>

1:38:20.736 --> 1:38:22.363
<i>- Come on back</i>
<i>- Come on back</i>

1:38:22.538 --> 1:38:25.029
<i>- Come on back</i>
<i>- Come on back</i>

1:38:25.207 --> 1:38:27.402
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1:38:27.576 --> 1:38:28.736
<i>I love them, I love them</i>

1:38:33.549 --> 1:38:36.677
<i>Those days, those days</i>
<i>Those days, those days</i>

1:38:36.852 --> 1:38:42.347
<i>Those days</i>

1:45:03.071 --> 1:45:06.063
