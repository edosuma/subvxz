17:16.767 --> 17:19.867
SHE FINALLY PULLED HER HAIR BACK
FROM HER EYES,

17:19.900 --> 17:22.933

"I'M STARTING TO REALIZE IT."

INTO IT,

19:37.700 --> 19:38.733

ABOUT TWO MONTHS,

19:38.767 --> 19:40.167
I FOUND MYSELF
SORT OF...

19:40.200 --> 19:41.733
FALLING UP THE STAIRS
TO MY DORM.

INSIDE,

20:50.033 --> 20:51.800
FOR MY WHOLE LIFE,

20:51.833 --> 20:54.667
AND, I MEAN, NOW THAT I KNOW
WHAT THAT FEELING IS...

20:56.567 --> 21:00.267
I'M PHYSICALLY
BECOMING ONE.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.700

GOING TO BE ONE AS WELL.

I AM A MAN.

21:54.233 --> 21:55.067
IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO LET ME
IN A UNIVERSITY

21:55.100 --> 21:56.333
JUST BECAUSE OF
MY COLOR

21:56.367 --> 21:57.567
OR MY
ECONOMIC STATUS,

21:57.600 --> 21:58.833
I'D HAVE BEEN
INSULTED.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.533
ADMISSION SHOULD BE
BASED ON MERIT,

22:00.567 --> 22:01.600

STIMULATING.

22:26.367 --> 22:27.667
THANK YOU.

22:49.433 --> 22:52.300
I THOUGHT WE HAD
AN UNDERSTANDING.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.567
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS
THAT YOU WANTED ME TO CAPITULATE

22:54.600 --> 22:56.267
TO SOME ASSHOLE'S
REPTILIAN POLITICS

22:56.300 --> 22:57.433
TO GET MONEY OUT OF HIM,

22:57.467 --> 22:58.500
AND THAT, I WILL NEVER DO.

22:58.533 --> 23:00.167
NO, ACTUALLY,
WHAT I ASKED YOU TO DO

23:00.200 --> 23:01.267
WAS TO PUT THE STUDENTS
AND UNIVERSITY

23:01.300 --> 23:02.367
AHEAD OF YOUR OWN EGO,

23:02.400 --> 23:03.800
SO WE COULD GET
THE REPTILE'S MONEY

23:03.833 --> 23:05.100
IN ORDER TO MAKE ART
AND NOT BOMBS,

23:05.133 --> 23:07.067
AND YOU AGREED.

23:14.133 --> 23:15.233

ABORTION OF W."

23:19.767 --> 23:22.567
SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL
STUDENT WORK I'VE SEEN.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.867
IT'S AN ABOMINATION,

23:24.900 --> 23:26.400
AND AN ABUSE
OF UNIVERSITY FUNDS.

23:26.433 --> 23:27.633
WELL, SKIP,
DON'T YOU THINK, REALLY,

23:27.667 --> 23:29.367
THAT THE PRIMARY MISSION
OF A UNIVERSITY

23:29.400 --> 23:33.400
IS TO PROVIDE A SAFE HAVEN
TO EXPLORE IDEAS

23:33.433 --> 23:35.267
AND EXPAND BOUNDARIES?

23:35.300 --> 23:36.900
