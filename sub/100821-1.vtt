WEBVTT

00:16.675 --> 00:19.675
Moving on to the main axis
in our show for today.

00:19.967 --> 00:23.717
Our national team fails to win
The Gulf Cup in its 23rd version

00:24.050 --> 00:26.342
and now hopes are high
for the Olympic team.

00:26.467 --> 00:27.717
to make amends

00:27.800 --> 00:30.050
In today's show we'll talk
about two main axises

00:30.175 --> 00:34.092
Firstly, we'll talk about our national
team's participation in The Gulf Cup.

00:34.258 --> 00:37.425
The positive and negative aspect
along the duration of the championship

00:37.508 --> 00:41.050
and the reasons behind the hard
elimination from the semi finals

00:41.217 --> 00:43.925
We'll talk about our Olympic team
and its coming participation

00:44.050 --> 00:48.508
in Asian Cup in China
with overwhelming news about...

00:48.680 --> 00:50.756
Yeah, slow
down there, bud.

00:50.758 --> 00:52.758
about calling up for players...

00:53.018 --> 00:54.756
Yeah, stop here, stop here.

00:54.758 --> 00:56.425
We'll discuss these topic with our
guest for today's show

00:56.592 --> 01:00.092
Please welcome captain Qussai Hashim
our international X player

01:00.300 --> 01:03.050
Welcome to our show, captain.

01:03.425 --> 01:08.925
Hello and thank you
and your audience for having me.

01:09.717 --> 01:11.717
Let get right into it, captain.

01:12.633 --> 01:16.639
What do you think of our
national team in The Gulf Cup?

01:31.489 --> 01:34.226
This
is not safe, Dan.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.320
Can you read that?

02:03.188 --> 02:06.725
Maasoum Asiz,
he's a local councillor.

02:09.762 --> 02:10.930
What's that?

02:24.443 --> 02:29.113
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.680
Hey, it's okay.

02:32.016 --> 02:33.019
It's okay!

02:42.193 --> 02:44.028
Dan, please!

02:44.030 --> 02:44.864
Get back!

02:46.199 --> 02:47.800
There are landmines.

02:54.973 --> 02:55.974
Okay, okay.

03:00.012 --> 03:00.812
It's okay.

03:05.217 --> 03:06.216
No!

04:21.093 --> 04:23.593
Last year we
heard a number of times

04:23.595 --> 04:26.529
that the crisis in Syria
has reached a tipping point.

04:26.531 --> 04:28.264
It did

04:28.266 --> 04:29.632
Well I don't
use tipping points

04:29.634 --> 04:32.469
or decision points for
a simple reason that

04:32.471 --> 04:33.937
I think in the
progression of history

04:33.939 --> 04:35.272
there are certain points
that we'll look back and say

04:35.274 --> 04:37.341
that was a critical day.

04:37.343 --> 04:39.442
Yesterday was a
very critical day.

04:39.444 --> 04:42.113
I mean this was going
for the jugular,

04:42.115 --> 04:42.945
and they did.

04:42.947 --> 04:44.481
The opposition to Cassa,

04:44.483 --> 04:46.149
to have struck down
his own brother-in-law,

04:46.151 --> 04:48.985
one of the strongest,
toughest men in the regime,

04:48.987 --> 04:51.555
a man blamed by the
United Nations, by the way

04:51.557 --> 04:53.889
for murdering Jessica Haimie.

06:01.026 --> 06:02.425
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:02.427 --> 06:03.094
- G'day mate, how are you?
- How are you doing?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.096
Okay, thanks.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.800
No problem, you have
whatever you want.

06:10.802 --> 06:11.635
All right.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.639
All right, thank you.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.257
Calling
commission by the conservative

06:33.259 --> 06:37.026
think tank, the Institute of
Public Affairs or the IPA.

06:37.028 --> 06:38.928
Strong
progressions that so much

06:38.930 --> 06:40.596
very carefully selects one.

06:40.598 --> 06:41.598
Can see the act.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.132
Which also makes it an offence

06:43.134 --> 06:46.603
to humiliate or intimidate a
person based on their race.

06:46.605 --> 06:48.572
James Pattison used
to work for the IPA.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.177
These days though he's a
liberal Senator in Victoria.

06:53.012 --> 06:53.946
Hey.

06:55.613 --> 06:56.445
Back again?

06:56.447 --> 06:57.880
Yes, is it all right?

06:57.882 --> 07:00.051
Yeah, knock yourself out.

07:35.052 --> 07:37.387
My wife has agreed
to look at the house.

07:37.389 --> 07:40.022
Yeah that's
good, really good.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.529
Oh, Dan, thanks.

07:46.531 --> 07:47.764
Sorry to rush you, mate, but
we're on the air in seconds

07:47.766 --> 07:49.265
so take this mic here.

07:49.267 --> 07:50.767
This one?

07:50.769 --> 07:52.303
Now do you need a glass
of water or something?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.269
No I'm fine,

07:53.271 --> 07:54.471
- thank you.
- Okay,

07:54.473 --> 07:54.973
if you could just
put the cans on.

07:56.274 --> 07:57.507
Ready to go?

07:57.509 --> 07:59.509
Okay we're on in 10 seconds.

07:59.511 --> 08:00.444
Okay.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.810
Quiet now.

08:01.812 --> 08:02.980
Across Australia,
you're with Fran Kelly,

08:02.982 --> 08:04.180
Radio National Breakfast.

08:04.182 --> 08:05.848
You're listening
to RN Breakfast

08:05.850 --> 08:07.384
and our next guest
has spent much

08:07.386 --> 08:10.553
of the last couple of decades
documenting human pain

08:10.555 --> 08:12.921
and misery really,
all over the world.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.591
Dan Fisher, welcome
to RN Breakfast.

08:14.593 --> 08:16.093
Thank you.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.363
Dan, your work is well
known all over the world,

08:19.365 --> 08:22.098
but strangely, it's
rarely shown here.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.767
And our Minister for
Board of Protection

08:23.769 --> 08:27.271
describes your photographs
as misery porn.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.040
What do you think
of that description?

08:32.177 --> 08:33.443
Have you heard that before?

08:33.445 --> 08:35.778
Have you had to
respond to that before?

08:35.780 --> 08:40.381
Look, I photograph what
my conscience asks me to.

08:40.384 --> 08:44.387
Even if it's hard
to see, to watch.

08:44.389 --> 08:46.055
Hopefully the images I take

08:46.057 --> 08:48.090
enable us to say of the subject,

08:48.092 --> 08:51.261
"We can see you, we
understand your plight.

08:51.263 --> 08:53.196
"You're not collateral damage."

08:53.198 --> 08:54.597
We're speaking
with award-winning

08:54.599 --> 08:56.465
war photographer Daniel Fisher.

08:56.467 --> 08:58.935
Dan's work will feature
at the Testament Festival

08:58.937 --> 09:01.271
at the State Library
later this year.

09:01.273 --> 09:03.839
Dan, do you think we've
become desensitised

09:03.841 --> 09:05.309
to these kind of images?

09:05.311 --> 09:06.177
I hope not.

09:07.513 --> 09:09.112
So I heard
the interview.

09:09.114 --> 09:12.214
Yeah, well, I can
only be as interesting

09:12.216 --> 09:13.883
as the questions, Ada.

09:13.885 --> 09:16.152
Listen, we're
all super excited

09:16.154 --> 09:18.655
about your involvement
in this festival.

09:18.657 --> 09:20.723
If I could just
get another image

09:20.725 --> 09:22.858
for the promotional material,

09:22.860 --> 09:24.764
something not too off-putting.

09:26.865 --> 09:28.430
Yep.

09:28.432 --> 09:29.802
It's marketing, Dan.

09:31.636 --> 09:33.936
I didn't realise we
were selling anything.

09:33.938 --> 09:34.905
Of course we are.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.272
It's a family event.

09:36.274 --> 09:38.344
We don't want to give
the kids nightmares.

09:39.477 --> 09:41.511
We're not dropping
bombs on them.

09:41.513 --> 09:43.345
It's the bombs that give
them the nightmares.

09:43.347 --> 09:44.182
Dan.

09:46.551 --> 09:50.153
Okay, I'll find a photo
of an orphan with a puppy.

09:50.155 --> 09:51.387
No puppies.

09:51.389 --> 09:53.189
Partners don't like
third world dogs.

09:53.191 --> 09:54.925
They like their dogs well fed.

09:54.927 --> 09:55.760
Jeez.

09:58.062 --> 09:59.030
Dan, are you home?

10:00.265 --> 10:01.598
Gotta go, Josie's here.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.965
Say hi to Josie for me.

10:02.967 --> 10:03.802
I will.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.472
Ada says hi!

10:07.605 --> 10:09.475
Welcome home!

10:14.011 --> 10:16.780
The washing machine's
buggered again.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.050
You're soaked.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.050
How was the trip?

10:21.052 --> 10:22.819
It was good.

10:22.821 --> 10:24.657
That's good.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.925
What's
with all the boxes?

10:28.927 --> 10:30.528
I'm just trying to tidy up.

10:33.365 --> 10:35.267
I missed you this trip.

10:36.735 --> 10:37.736
I always miss you.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.781
I bought strawberries.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.028
Hi there.

11:39.030 --> 11:40.531
Hi.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.133
I'm looking for the
photographer, Daniel Fisher.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.636
He will be in your
Testament Exhibition.

11:46.638 --> 11:48.805
Oh, no, he doesn't
actually work here.

11:48.807 --> 11:51.273
You could ask our
Special Projects Curator.

11:51.275 --> 11:55.113
Her email's on the
back of this brochure.

11:59.384 --> 12:01.187
I wish to send
him an invitation.

12:02.153 --> 12:04.219
Have you tried his website?

12:04.221 --> 12:09.095
Actually, I can do

12:22.408 --> 12:23.308
How was the trip?

12:29.313 --> 12:30.115
Good.

12:31.649 --> 12:32.485
Really?

12:37.654 --> 12:40.225
I'll tell you about it later.

12:59.311 --> 13:00.479
I've got it.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.858
All right, I'm coming!

13:29.642 --> 13:30.839
Hi, my friend.

13:30.841 --> 13:31.675
Hello.

13:31.677 --> 13:32.644
I'm Sebastian Ahmed.

13:35.113 --> 13:38.547
Okay, I didn't call
a taxi, you know.

13:38.549 --> 13:43.185
I'm looking for Daniel
Fisher, the photographer.

13:43.187 --> 13:44.657
Well you found him, that's me.

13:45.490 --> 13:47.056
I heard you on the radio.

13:47.058 --> 13:48.092
Your radio interview.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.259
You were talking of hope.

13:50.261 --> 13:51.696
Are you a man of hope, sir?

13:52.697 --> 13:53.765
Not generally, no.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.967
What is it you want?

13:56.969 --> 13:59.301
I have formed
a community choir

13:59.303 --> 14:02.640
and it's my hope that
you can photograph us.

14:03.841 --> 14:05.677
I'm not that kind
of photographer, man.

14:07.178 --> 14:10.182
Daniel Fisher from
Sydney, Australia.

14:11.316 --> 14:13.185
You have been to my
country of South Sudan.

14:14.552 --> 14:16.853
You know there is much
repair work for us to do.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.722
I wish you to photograph
our contribution.

14:18.724 --> 14:21.056
I'll get you a
contact, just hang on.

14:21.058 --> 14:21.894
Daniel.

14:25.063 --> 14:27.262
I wish to invite you to the
Croydon community centre.

14:27.264 --> 14:29.431
We are there every Tuesday
from seven o'clock.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.971
Now look, Leo, I'm
the wrong man, okay?

14:32.971 --> 14:34.440
Did you want me to sign that?

14:36.274 --> 14:37.640
No, thank you.

14:37.642 --> 14:38.608
Okay, just wait here.

14:38.610 --> 14:39.979
I'll get you a phone number.

14:46.851 --> 14:47.886
Who was it?

14:49.019 --> 14:51.353
Some man, South Sudanese.

14:51.355 --> 14:53.759
Taxi driver looking
for a photographer.

15:02.801 --> 15:03.903
Dan, I'm pregnant.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.808
15 weeks.

15:12.844 --> 15:16.280
I've had all the tests,
everything's fine, I'm fine,

15:16.282 --> 15:17.283
the baby's fine.

15:31.863 --> 15:33.766
I thought we decided.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.434
I know.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.106
I wanted to get the all
clear before I told you.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.682
Fuck.

15:50.948 --> 15:53.016
I thought you'd be pleased.

15:53.018 --> 15:53.851
I am.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.056
I thought we decided!

16:01.058 --> 16:06.030
I know.

16:12.570 --> 16:16.339
Do I get a say in this?

16:16.341 --> 16:17.342
Of course.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.614
But Dan, this is happening.

16:24.115 --> 16:26.016
What's that meant to mean?

16:30.822 --> 16:32.022
Dan.

16:32.024 --> 16:32.857
Dan?

16:36.394 --> 16:37.228
Dan!

16:57.749 --> 16:59.682
Are you all right?

16:59.684 --> 17:00.718
Are you okay?

17:04.689 --> 17:06.425
You don't have to wait.

17:08.425 --> 17:09.260
I will wait.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.731
Do you have many
pictures of my village

17:16.733 --> 17:18.935
outside Maridi in South Sudan?

17:21.105 --> 17:21.940
I've no idea.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.645
Thank you for helping me, but,

17:29.446 --> 17:30.948
really you don't need to wait.

17:37.654 --> 17:40.058
My friend, we can help you.

17:45.363 --> 17:47.365
Graham, you
didn't have to come.

17:48.733 --> 17:50.967
The doctor says that
you can go home tomorrow.

17:50.969 --> 17:51.769
What happened?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.138
I don't know, I just tripped.

17:55.140 --> 17:55.974
Jesus.

17:57.474 --> 17:58.976
Graham Fisher, Dan's brother.

18:00.144 --> 18:02.612
I'm Sebastian Ahmed,
pleased to meet you.

18:02.614 --> 18:05.681
Mr. Ahmed
brought Dan in his taxi.

18:05.683 --> 18:07.219
Well, what do we owe you?

18:08.186 --> 18:09.684
No, please.

18:09.686 --> 18:12.890
Be well, Daniel Fisher
from Sydney, Australia.

18:19.096 --> 18:19.932
Hang on.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.104
Mr. Ahmed.

18:26.604 --> 18:27.439
Sorry.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.007
Sorry, were you
there when he fell?

18:32.009 --> 18:32.845
Yeah.

18:34.846 --> 18:36.347
What happened?

18:39.050 --> 18:40.885
He tripped, as he said.

18:42.386 --> 18:47.259
And I didn't really
see what happened.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.427
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:51.429 --> 18:52.393
Okay.

18:52.395 --> 18:54.365
- Thank you.
- No worries.

19:03.674 --> 19:04.974
Hello.

19:04.976 --> 19:06.275
- How are you?
- How are you?

19:06.277 --> 19:07.610
No, he is sleeping.

19:07.612 --> 19:09.515
- Oh, sorry.
- Sleeping.

20:08.239 --> 20:10.509
Hello, my darling.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.974
Have you ever experienced
memory loss before?

20:44.976 --> 20:46.174
No.

20:46.176 --> 20:46.978
Yes.

20:47.845 --> 20:48.947
Yes, he has.

20:51.415 --> 20:52.216
Any headaches?

20:54.051 --> 20:55.183
Coordination issues?

20:55.185 --> 20:55.987
No.

20:58.222 --> 21:00.189
He doesn't sleep.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.893
Well I've never really slept.

21:03.260 --> 21:06.030
He's restless all
night, he wakes suddenly.

21:10.402 --> 21:12.901
Have you ever
had a head trauma?

21:12.903 --> 21:13.969
Some, yeah.

21:13.971 --> 21:14.804
What, more than one?

21:14.806 --> 21:15.641
Yeah.

21:16.673 --> 21:20.343
From mainly small artillery.

21:20.345 --> 21:21.677
Mortars, land mines,

21:21.679 --> 21:26.216
you know other munitions
like IEDs, grenades,

21:26.218 --> 21:27.350
that sort of thing.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.553
In close proximity?

21:29.554 --> 21:30.518
Yeah.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.687
Repeat exposure?

21:31.689 --> 21:32.855
Yep.

21:32.857 --> 21:34.393
And over what period
of time, months?

21:36.227 --> 21:37.062
Years?

21:39.897 --> 21:40.731
Decades.

21:44.568 --> 21:46.235
Okay.

21:46.237 --> 21:47.306
Any panic attacks?

21:49.874 --> 21:50.675
Yes.

22:00.384 --> 22:01.519
Traumatic flashbacks?

22:04.855 --> 22:05.557
Yeah.

22:08.425 --> 22:09.260
Okay.

22:14.199 --> 22:15.300
This is the hippocampus.

22:16.800 --> 22:21.472
Now since your last scan,
there's a

22:33.018 --> 22:37.353
We're gonna sit with our
feet together, spines tall.

22:37.355 --> 22:39.055
Guys, if it's a bit
uncomfortable to sit

22:39.057 --> 22:40.556
with your feet together,

22:40.558 --> 22:43.525
you can have your legs crossed
if that feels better for you.

22:43.527 --> 22:46.261
Let's place one hand on
the belly and one hand

22:46.263 --> 22:47.228
on the heart.

22:47.230 --> 22:49.065
So in the centre of your chest.

22:49.067 --> 22:50.431
Nice, and guys you
can do the same.

22:50.433 --> 22:52.301
So one hand on your
partner's belly

22:52.303 --> 22:54.406
and one hand in the
middle of your chest.

22:57.509 --> 23:00.008
I have facilities, I'm
prepared to share them.

23:00.010 --> 23:01.944
I have a business,
I'm prepared to share,

23:01.946 --> 23:05.180
I also have an excellent
financial advisor.

23:05.182 --> 23:07.853
And did I mention I
will soon have a boat.

23:11.221 --> 23:12.988
Your new archive.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.891
Well, what Josie's
been able to pack up,

23:15.893 --> 23:17.596
I gather you're
dragging your feet.

23:21.265 --> 23:24.236
I started scanning
a long shortlist.

23:28.739 --> 23:30.174
I thought you were flat out.

23:31.307 --> 23:32.173
Well I'm here for you, okay?

23:32.175 --> 23:33.010
We all are.

23:34.311 --> 23:35.611
I'm making a file of selects

23:35.613 --> 23:37.846
for you to have a look at too.

23:37.848 --> 23:40.882
There are some great shots.

23:40.884 --> 23:43.318
This exhibition is
gonna be a cracker.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.555
When do we move the rest?

23:45.722 --> 23:47.890
I wanted to talk
about mum's rings.

23:47.892 --> 23:49.424
Mum's wedding ring?

23:49.426 --> 23:51.192
About bloody time.

23:51.194 --> 23:53.432
I thought I might
surprise Jos before I go.

23:55.098 --> 23:56.734
You're not going away, Dan.

23:57.902 --> 23:59.438
Well that's my
decision to make.

24:03.374 --> 24:05.641
You sure Claire
doesn't want them?

24:05.643 --> 24:07.809
If I'd given Claire
an engagement ring

24:07.811 --> 24:09.780
as small as that,

24:11.515 --> 24:13.384
she would have dumped my ass.

24:15.519 --> 24:16.721
Anyway you know Claire.

24:18.388 --> 24:20.224
Phobic of that second hand shit.

24:26.897 --> 24:29.398
Videos like
these tell a familiar story

24:29.400 --> 24:30.767
from inside Syria.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.634
Like most, they're
hard to verify

24:32.636 --> 24:35.136
but appear to show evidence
of the Assad regime's

24:35.138 --> 24:37.306
assault on the city of Hama.

24:37.308 --> 24:39.842
Not all violence is
so easily visible.

24:39.844 --> 24:42.010
Amnesty International
says the tactics

24:42.012 --> 24:44.180
are being used on prisoners.

24:48.185 --> 24:50.489
The methods of
torture is returned to

25:01.732 --> 25:03.134
Just a minute please.

25:06.104 --> 25:08.807
One, two, three, four.

25:49.513 --> 25:51.282
That was beautiful.

26:04.095 --> 26:05.760
We hope you will
fall in love with us

26:05.762 --> 26:06.932
and in voices of hope.

26:08.766 --> 26:09.935
You are one of us.

26:11.102 --> 26:12.634
I am not sure
that I am really.

26:12.636 --> 26:15.807
We also suffer with
Post Traumatic Stress.

26:17.307 --> 26:19.644
We shake off the bad spirit.

26:21.444 --> 26:22.978
Don't be ashamed, my brother.

26:22.980 --> 26:25.817
Yes, don't be ashamed,
it's easy, look.

26:30.221 --> 26:31.056
See?

26:36.560 --> 26:39.930
I'm Sebastian Ahmed
from South Sudan.

26:40.897 --> 26:41.966
High Equatoria region.

26:44.134 --> 26:47.402
And I'm Mohamed Bangoura.

26:47.404 --> 26:48.239
I'm from Guinea.

26:50.974 --> 26:53.441
I am Timpani, I
am from Zimbabwe

26:53.443 --> 26:55.512
which is in the south,
and part of Africa.

26:57.347 --> 27:02.354
I'm Eric Ndabunguye from
DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa.

27:05.489 --> 27:07.555
My name is Dereb Desalegn.

27:07.557 --> 27:08.759
I'm from Ethiopia.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.097
My name is Sammla Stole.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.634
I'm from South Africa.

27:18.435 --> 27:22.571
My name is Rassin
Kassang and I'm from Syria,

27:22.573 --> 27:23.975
what is left of Syria.

27:26.477 --> 27:28.680
And I'm Daniel Fisher

27:29.680 --> 27:31.850
and I'm from Sydney, Australia.

28:33.310 --> 28:36.178
Do you remember Maridi?

28:36.180 --> 28:37.511
No.

28:37.513 --> 28:39.317
Well not fully, not really, no.

28:44.888 --> 28:46.889
There was a massacre.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.726
Yeah.

28:51.028 --> 28:52.594
You were there.

28:52.596 --> 28:54.398
In your book there
are photographs.

28:55.767 --> 28:56.601
I know, but,

28:58.102 --> 29:01.239
that was 15 years ago and
my memory's full of holes.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.142
I understand.

29:05.675 --> 29:06.810
Many died.

29:08.813 --> 29:10.014
All my family.

29:18.888 --> 29:21.058
I'm sorry about your family.

29:26.865 --> 29:27.699
Thanks, God.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.643
I have a wish

29:40.811 --> 29:43.144
that you will not display
photograph of my village

29:43.146 --> 29:44.515
to the Australian public.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.185
We do not deserve to be judged.

29:49.385 --> 29:51.886
People won't judge.

29:51.888 --> 29:54.424
They always judge us but
they cannot understand.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.093
Well that's exactly why
the photos need to be seen.

29:58.095 --> 29:59.428
I cannot agree.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.595
There have been
enough suffering.

30:01.597 --> 30:02.930
Our choirs are what the subject

30:02.932 --> 30:04.301
for the Testament exhibition.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.105
Look, I haven't made
my final decision.

30:11.608 --> 30:12.776
We are brothers, yes?

30:14.300 --> 30:15.300
Goodbye.

30:15.758 --> 30:17.050
Goodbye.

30:51.316 --> 30:52.847
It's still here.

30:52.849 --> 30:55.484
Sebastian, if no one wants it,

30:55.486 --> 30:57.188
it must be a dump, eh?

30:58.689 --> 31:01.590
What could be wrong
with it, it's a house.

31:01.592 --> 31:03.092
A house cannot be built on air.

31:03.094 --> 31:04.863
It must be built on land.

31:06.063 --> 31:08.430
Kalmi, you'll have a
garden with veggies

31:08.432 --> 31:10.268
and a chicken palace!

31:14.070 --> 31:15.903
All I'm saying is for
the same amount of money

31:15.905 --> 31:17.939
we can have a nice
clean apartment

31:17.941 --> 31:20.010
with nothing that needs fixing.

31:21.479 --> 31:23.815
Oh, you need a haircut.

31:24.781 --> 31:25.713
So cut it.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.184
Go to the barber.

31:28.719 --> 31:30.555
I like it better
when you'll do it.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.024
After your shift.

31:40.263 --> 31:42.097
Anishka, you are a bully.

31:42.099 --> 31:44.431
I can't
help it if I know

31:44.433 --> 31:47.105
what's best for everyone, eh?

31:48.138 --> 31:48.970
She here?

31:48.972 --> 31:50.305
Oh, oh.

31:50.307 --> 31:51.806
- Wait, wait.
- I think I'll get the bag.

31:51.808 --> 31:52.844
Wait a second.

31:54.511 --> 31:55.677
- Good morning.
- Good morning,

31:55.679 --> 31:56.511
how are you?

31:56.513 --> 31:57.345
I'm good, how are you?

31:57.347 --> 31:58.180
Well thank you.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.014
That's good.

31:59.016 --> 32:00.215
She's good today.

32:00.217 --> 32:01.149
- Yeah, she's been good?
- Yeah, she's good.

32:01.151 --> 32:04.553
She's ready, okay.

32:04.555 --> 32:05.323
Ah, thank you.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.027
Coming up, up up up,
heels on the ground, good.

32:13.029 --> 32:15.263
Look at the hand, present it.

32:15.265 --> 32:16.965
Come back, great.

32:16.967 --> 32:18.801
Okay let's get rid of the bars.

32:18.803 --> 32:19.971
Pick sticks.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.109
Very good.

32:31.647 --> 32:33.882
And this one's Haiti.

32:33.884 --> 32:36.352
Shall we start
with the published works?

32:36.354 --> 32:37.986
Yes.

32:37.988 --> 32:39.157
And just as a way in?

32:41.758 --> 32:44.692
We were thinking of
breaking it down by country

32:44.694 --> 32:45.730
rather than year.

32:48.199 --> 32:49.097
Sure.

32:49.099 --> 32:49.933
Great.

32:59.509 --> 33:01.144
I'm not
sure about these.

33:02.145 --> 33:03.780
They're one of
your best known.

33:05.182 --> 33:07.849
It's Sebastian
Ahmed's village.

33:07.851 --> 33:09.051
The taxi driver?

33:09.053 --> 33:10.822
You know
someone from here?

33:12.556 --> 33:14.255
He set up a community choir.

33:14.257 --> 33:15.860
He wants me to photograph them.

33:16.727 --> 33:18.393
They're pretty good.

33:18.395 --> 33:19.230
Great story.

33:21.898 --> 33:24.732
He asked me not to exhibit
photos of his village.

33:24.734 --> 33:25.968
Why?

33:25.970 --> 33:27.404
His family died in
the massacre there.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.309
All the more reason
to include them.

33:35.311 --> 33:37.147
You're making sure
they're not forgotten.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.969
Can we talk some more about
the Sudanese pictures?

34:00.104 --> 34:02.805
You've worked so hard
not to censor yourself

34:02.807 --> 34:05.175
and now a taxi driver's
telling you what to do?

34:16.387 --> 34:17.221
Eve's.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.101
These booties.

35:05.268 --> 35:06.635
Oh, don't scalp me.

35:06.637 --> 35:07.970
You said short.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.570
The hair, not me.

35:09.572 --> 35:11.108
Then stop wriggling.

35:13.175 --> 35:14.311
I'm too excited.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.349
I don't want to move.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.185
I love it here.

35:23.653 --> 35:24.989
What do you love so much?

35:25.889 --> 35:26.857
The carpet.

35:28.224 --> 35:31.061
It's my favourite colour, puke.

35:32.362 --> 35:34.764
And it's provide us
with free electricity.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.767
And I love the stain
on the ceiling.

35:39.769 --> 35:40.969
The obscene mystery stain?

35:40.971 --> 35:42.572
Mhmm, yes.

35:44.307 --> 35:45.275
The very one.

35:46.675 --> 35:49.644
Careful, Sebastian.

35:49.646 --> 35:53.215
I know that you
are allergic to our new house.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.883
But I will make it perfect.

35:54.885 --> 35:55.720
How?

35:57.153 --> 36:00.054
You already work nonstop.

36:00.056 --> 36:04.227
When we are safe in our
own piece of this earth,

36:05.896 --> 36:07.765
we can begin our true life.

36:13.304 --> 36:14.137
We work.

36:16.072 --> 36:17.607
That is our life.

36:19.143 --> 36:20.278
It's all we ever do.

36:22.346 --> 36:25.746
Sebastian, one day
you'll look at the tired

36:25.748 --> 36:27.548
old woman in your bed

36:27.550 --> 36:30.688
and you'll say "Who is this?"

36:31.889 --> 36:34.925
And I'll say, "It's
me, remember?"

36:38.262 --> 36:41.095
Oh, Sebastian, look,
I'm covered in hair.

36:41.097 --> 36:42.099
It's too much.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.435
I have to have another shower.

36:46.637 --> 36:49.574
Come on, I'll scrub
your back, old man.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.139
I'm shy.

36:52.141 --> 36:53.443
You are not shy.

37:58.175 --> 37:59.340
That was good.

37:59.342 --> 38:00.342
I forgot my part.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.175
Do a bit faster?

38:01.177 --> 38:02.010
Faster?

38:02.012 --> 38:03.278
Miss that note.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.311
No, 'cause
I missed a note.

38:04.313 --> 38:06.380
Let's do it once more.

38:06.382 --> 38:07.347
Oh!

38:07.349 --> 38:09.150
- Hello.
- My friend.

38:09.152 --> 38:10.719
Come, come, come, join us.

38:10.721 --> 38:11.686
No, no, no, no.

38:11.688 --> 38:12.686
Please don't let me interrupt.

38:12.688 --> 38:13.854
Come and sing.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.592
No, I can't
sing, I can't sing.

38:18.695 --> 38:20.028
People are more scared to sing

38:20.030 --> 38:21.429
than to shoot a gun.

38:21.431 --> 38:22.733
Oh, I understand that.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.769
Where is your camera?

38:27.271 --> 38:28.570
Oh, come, don't worry.

38:28.572 --> 38:29.637
Just come, come sit.

38:29.639 --> 38:30.472
- Hello.
- Hey.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.338
Hey, hey, hey.

38:31.340 --> 38:32.139
- Mohamed, hi.
- How you doing?

38:32.141 --> 38:32.974
How you do?

38:32.976 --> 38:33.807
Hey, hey.

38:33.809 --> 38:34.644
Please.

38:47.724 --> 38:48.856
Thank you, good night.

38:48.858 --> 38:50.057
See you, see you,

38:50.059 --> 38:50.858
- see you, goodbye.
- All right, goodbye.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.226
See you, take care.

38:52.228 --> 38:54.231
Really good singing, beautiful.

38:55.365 --> 38:57.465
Who's catching
a train with me?

38:57.467 --> 38:59.434
Can I give you a lift?

38:59.436 --> 39:00.401
That's kind of you.

39:00.403 --> 39:01.302
Yeah?

39:01.304 --> 39:02.072
- Thank you.
- Okay.

39:06.143 --> 39:09.144
When will you
bring your camera?

39:09.146 --> 39:11.682
What, so I can record
your good deed for Allah?

39:13.148 --> 39:14.682
God already knows everything.

39:14.684 --> 39:17.651
For each of us there is an
angel to record our deeds.

39:17.653 --> 39:19.521
Oh, I don't believe in angels.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.658
I'm an infidel.

39:22.525 --> 39:24.726
Angels are not
deterred by your lack of faith.

39:28.865 --> 39:30.097
I'm parked there.

39:30.099 --> 39:31.967
Yeah,
you parked there?

39:35.472 --> 39:36.304
Right up the back?

39:36.306 --> 39:37.942
Yeah.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.213
Thanks for the ride.

39:46.215 --> 39:48.048
It's my pleasure,
Sebastian, thank you.

39:48.050 --> 39:49.818
Come, you will meet my family.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.052
No, I should go,
really, thanks.

39:52.054 --> 39:53.153
Please, we are already here.

39:53.155 --> 39:54.424
They will love to meet you.

39:57.527 --> 39:58.594
Okay.

39:58.596 --> 39:59.526
Yeah.

39:59.528 --> 40:00.695
Not too long though.

40:00.697 --> 40:01.699
All right.

40:04.934 --> 40:07.802
You must not butt in
and discuss my wife

40:07.804 --> 40:09.306
by speaking the past.

40:10.740 --> 40:13.009
I have never told her
about my life from before.

40:16.679 --> 40:17.945
Do you tell your
wife what you witness

40:17.947 --> 40:19.150
when you are away?

40:21.985 --> 40:25.155
Not everything, no.

40:26.322 --> 40:28.356
You see, there
is too much pain.

40:28.358 --> 40:30.260
A man must protect his family.

40:34.697 --> 40:35.597
I understand.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.434
Yeah, please, let's go.

40:38.434 --> 40:39.802
Are you done?

40:39.804 --> 40:40.637
One more spoon?

40:41.572 --> 40:42.903
One more, nope?

40:42.905 --> 40:43.940
Here comes the train.

40:44.807 --> 40:46.508
There we go, good girl.

40:46.510 --> 40:47.474
Anishka.

40:47.476 --> 40:48.976
Daniel, this is my wife Anishka.

40:48.978 --> 40:50.445
Hi Anishka.

40:50.447 --> 40:51.445
Anishka, this is Daniel.

40:51.447 --> 40:52.282
Hello, hello.

40:53.349 --> 40:56.217
Sebastian, eh?

40:56.219 --> 40:57.318
Why didn't you tell me

40:57.320 --> 40:58.487
you were bringing somebody home?

40:58.489 --> 40:59.320
Ah it's all right.

40:59.322 --> 41:00.688
Don't worry, Nish.

41:00.690 --> 41:01.523
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

41:01.525 --> 41:02.259
It's okay.

41:03.893 --> 41:04.858
- We're here.
- So.

41:04.860 --> 41:05.927
- Is it okay?
- Daddy's back.

41:05.929 --> 41:07.195
Maybe I should go.

41:07.197 --> 41:09.231
Ah no, it's all
right, it's okay.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.465
Please, please be seated.

41:10.467 --> 41:11.432
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:11.434 --> 41:12.633
This is Kalmira.

41:12.635 --> 41:13.601
- Hello, Kalmira.
- What a cutie face.

41:13.603 --> 41:14.572
Hello.

41:18.507 --> 41:20.173
The place is a mess.

41:20.175 --> 41:21.144
I will tidy up.

41:24.481 --> 41:25.646
Oh, please.

41:25.648 --> 41:26.481
The tea?

41:26.483 --> 41:27.318
Yes.

41:28.518 --> 41:29.352
Beautiful.

41:30.554 --> 41:31.720
This is a mess,

41:31.722 --> 41:32.686
- the entire thing.
- I will cook a curry.

41:32.688 --> 41:33.822
What with?

41:33.824 --> 41:34.722
- What with?
- Please don't go

41:34.724 --> 41:36.090
to any trouble.

41:36.092 --> 41:37.726
All we have is leftovers
from the restaurant.

41:37.728 --> 41:39.427
That sounds great.

41:39.429 --> 41:41.865
It'll only
take a minute to prepare.

41:47.771 --> 41:51.139
Daniel is a photographer
that I'm praying

41:51.141 --> 41:53.842
that he will chronicle
our voices of hope.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.010
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.510
I will heat up the food.

41:56.512 --> 41:59.313
I will heat up the food.

41:59.315 --> 42:00.514
It's all right.

42:00.516 --> 42:02.849
Please, Daniel,
feel at home please.

42:02.851 --> 42:04.385
Okay, thank you.

42:04.387 --> 42:07.155
All I'm saying is for
the same amount of money

42:07.157 --> 42:09.724
we can have a nice
clean apartment.

42:09.726 --> 42:10.724
Thank you.

42:10.726 --> 42:12.360
Our apartment is built on air.

42:12.362 --> 42:13.762
Land is security.

42:13.764 --> 42:14.765
Only land.

42:16.632 --> 42:18.301
Listen to Scarlett O'hara.

42:19.768 --> 42:22.472
As God as my witness, I will
never be homeless again.

42:26.175 --> 42:27.941
I'm just teasing you.

42:27.943 --> 42:29.610
Land, land, land.

42:29.612 --> 42:31.514
With your friend,
it is always land.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.985
You're yawning.

42:36.987 --> 42:38.153
I know, she's very,

42:38.155 --> 42:39.987
you are tired my darling.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.188
It was nice to meet you Dan,

42:41.190 --> 42:42.557
I'm going to take her to sleep.

42:42.559 --> 42:43.724
You too Anishka, thank you.

42:43.726 --> 42:45.260
Thank you so much.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.695
Come to mama.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.195
Land is security.

42:48.197 --> 42:51.599
Sebastian, let go
of the land situation.

42:51.601 --> 42:52.603
Say goodnight, say goodnight.

42:54.570 --> 42:56.237
Don't excite her.

42:56.239 --> 42:57.938
Always before bedtime
you will excite her.

42:57.940 --> 42:59.139
You are always
nibbling at her.

42:59.141 --> 43:01.642
No, not always
nibbling at my baby.

43:01.644 --> 43:03.110
Good night, Anishka.

43:03.112 --> 43:04.981
Good night.

43:14.556 --> 43:15.391
Thank you.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.360
You heard our choir

43:20.362 --> 43:22.432
and now you have seen my heart.

43:24.134 --> 43:25.266
You understand I
would like to see

43:25.268 --> 43:27.137
any other photographs
of my village?

43:30.239 --> 43:31.040
Really?

43:32.474 --> 43:34.008
You're not strong
enough to bear witness

43:34.010 --> 43:34.979
alone, my friend.

43:38.280 --> 43:39.115
Okay.

43:41.351 --> 43:42.186
Okay.

43:43.152 --> 43:45.186
Thanks for tonight, thank you.

43:45.188 --> 43:46.190
All right.

44:16.219 --> 44:17.054
Oh god.

44:20.157 --> 44:21.125
You okay?

44:24.695 --> 44:25.763
Yeah I'm fine.

44:27.429 --> 44:28.865
Go back to sleep.

45:38.568 --> 45:40.971
What are you doing?

45:43.139 --> 45:46.976
Sebastian wants to see
the photos of his village.

45:49.010 --> 45:50.614
You don't need his permission.

45:51.947 --> 45:53.516
I know, but it's his history.

45:54.384 --> 45:55.552
It's your life's work.

46:00.822 --> 46:03.726
Hasn't made a
difference, has it?

46:09.565 --> 46:11.400
You can't know that.

46:14.237 --> 46:16.472
I've got a brain full
of plaque for what?

46:25.981 --> 46:27.048
Right, go.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.349
You go back to bed.

46:28.351 --> 46:29.219
I'm a mess.

46:35.025 --> 46:37.528
Why is it easier for
you to talk to a stranger

46:38.762 --> 46:39.596
than me?

46:50.606 --> 46:52.442
Why don't you come
to the choir with me?

46:55.846 --> 46:56.679
You'll love it.

47:11.393 --> 47:13.094
Thank you, thank
you, thank you.

47:13.096 --> 47:15.715
Sebastian, Anishka, Kalmira,

47:15.717 --> 47:16.550
Hello.

47:16.633 --> 47:18.342
- Hello.
- Welcome.

47:18.344 --> 47:20.900
Sebastian, today,

47:20.902 --> 47:22.637
you have guaranteed
your future here

47:22.639 --> 47:24.548
in this great country.

47:24.550 --> 47:26.675
Congratulations. Congratulations.

47:29.445 --> 47:32.345
Thank you.

47:32.347 --> 47:34.014
- Thank you.
- Now let's cut the cake.

47:38.322 --> 47:41.456
Anishka doesn't know
anything about the photos.

47:41.458 --> 47:42.259
Okay.

47:43.427 --> 47:44.224
I don't think he's
told her anything

47:44.226 --> 47:45.027
about his past at all.

47:46.262 --> 47:47.097
You're kidding.

47:49.097 --> 47:50.264
Sebastian.

47:50.266 --> 47:51.398
- Oh, Dan.
- Congratulations.

47:51.400 --> 47:52.633
Oh, thank you.

47:52.635 --> 47:53.733
Thank you so much.

47:53.735 --> 47:55.135
- You remember Josie?
- Hello.

47:55.137 --> 47:55.936
- So lovely to see you again.
- Josie, how are you?

47:55.938 --> 47:56.906
Good to see you too.

47:58.809 --> 47:59.673
Hi, Anishka.

47:59.675 --> 48:01.175
Hello Dan, how are you?

48:01.177 --> 48:02.844
This is Josie, my partner.

48:02.846 --> 48:04.177
Anishka.

48:04.179 --> 48:05.612
Congratulations
on the house.

48:05.614 --> 48:07.014
Thanks.

48:07.016 --> 48:10.650
We're running out of
space at the apartment.

48:10.652 --> 48:12.153
Oh!

48:12.155 --> 48:13.857
Double congratulations!

48:15.025 --> 48:15.856
How long?

48:15.858 --> 48:18.191
Four months, yes.

48:18.193 --> 48:20.228
Oh and you too,

48:20.230 --> 48:21.731
Dan tells us about the bub.

48:24.132 --> 48:26.133
So when are you moving in?

48:26.135 --> 48:27.101
It
may be some months

48:27.103 --> 48:28.802
before the house is ready.

48:28.804 --> 48:30.771
It's got potential.

48:30.773 --> 48:32.507
At the moment,
that's all it's got.

48:32.509 --> 48:33.342
Oh dear.

48:34.844 --> 48:35.679
Hey.

48:37.614 --> 48:38.947
I'm here to steal the baby,

48:38.949 --> 48:40.849
show it to the band.

48:40.851 --> 48:41.684
Ah!

48:58.099 --> 48:59.469
You pull the car here over.

49:00.936 --> 49:02.135
What's wrong?

49:02.137 --> 49:03.438
Can you pull the
car over, please, Jos?

49:03.440 --> 49:04.938
What's wrong?

49:04.940 --> 49:09.846
Dan, what's wrong?

49:22.057 --> 49:22.893
Dan?

49:26.929 --> 49:27.864
What is it?

49:36.472 --> 49:38.338
Why didn't you
tell me straight away

49:38.340 --> 49:40.009
you were pregnant?

49:42.277 --> 49:43.278
You were in the field.

49:43.280 --> 49:44.778
I didn't wanna worry you.

49:44.780 --> 49:47.483
So you decided
for me, did you?

49:48.552 --> 49:50.053
I was being considerate.

49:52.221 --> 49:53.056
What is going on?

49:54.889 --> 49:56.525
I would have liked to know.

50:00.362 --> 50:02.396
That's not how it works, is it?

50:02.398 --> 50:05.766
You wanna help choose the photos

50:05.768 --> 50:08.302
so that's what happens.

50:08.304 --> 50:10.570
You wanna renovate, we renovate.

50:10.572 --> 50:11.972
You want us to stay in Sydney

50:11.974 --> 50:14.143
so I spent half my
life in the air.

50:15.945 --> 50:18.778
You want another baby, righty-o.

50:18.780 --> 50:20.548
What about what I want?

50:20.550 --> 50:22.316
You do what you
want all the time.

50:22.318 --> 50:23.550
You always have.

50:23.552 --> 50:25.353
I make plenty of compromises.

50:25.355 --> 50:28.125
It's not my fault
that you're unwell!

50:30.592 --> 50:32.559
I know how hard this is for you,

50:32.561 --> 50:34.362
your life is changing.

50:34.364 --> 50:36.597
Oh, Jesus, that's
fucking words,

50:36.599 --> 50:38.934
one way of putting
it, look at me.

50:41.137 --> 50:44.306
If I could donate an
organ to fix you, I would.

50:47.844 --> 50:49.146
But it's not all bad.

50:50.847 --> 50:52.682
Your work is being honoured.

50:54.016 --> 50:55.684
You can improve physically.

50:57.686 --> 51:00.990
You've got me and the baby.

51:02.391 --> 51:04.427
But I could lose
you and the baby.

51:13.436 --> 51:18.442
There is no way I would
have wanted you to risk

51:19.141 --> 51:20.943
having this child

51:22.846 --> 51:24.646
after what happened.

51:24.648 --> 51:26.179
You know that!

51:26.181 --> 51:28.517
And that's why you
didn't tell me!

51:42.231 --> 51:46.403
How many times have
you risked your life

51:48.637 --> 51:49.940
without asking me first?

52:29.445 --> 52:30.447
All right.

52:35.018 --> 52:36.818
I'll leave you to it.

52:36.820 --> 52:37.721
Stay, please.

52:41.356 --> 52:42.192
Stay.

53:04.847 --> 53:07.651
This was my favourite
time of year

53:09.351 --> 53:10.686
before the wet season.

53:13.556 --> 53:16.590
They would take new
calves out on the valley.

53:16.592 --> 53:18.427
I was with my first wife then.

53:29.239 --> 53:30.240
Where is she now?

53:39.014 --> 53:39.848
Raped.

53:41.349 --> 53:42.851
Then murdered with machetes.

53:50.592 --> 53:53.528
You don't have to put
yourself through this.

53:53.530 --> 53:56.066
You have opened
a door to the past.

53:57.599 --> 53:58.934
I must go through.

54:19.221 --> 54:22.224
All men would go
there to a meeting.

54:23.358 --> 54:27.563
All the women and
children were at home.

54:33.436 --> 54:35.802
We didn't know
there were militia

54:35.804 --> 54:40.809
in the area, teenage boys
drinking paint stripper.

54:44.112 --> 54:47.016
Paint stripper, not beer.

54:52.155 --> 54:54.524
I try to find a reason
for what happened.

54:57.594 --> 54:58.695
There was no reason.

55:16.612 --> 55:18.315
I can see in my mind

55:21.050 --> 55:23.219
the feast of bull flies

55:27.222 --> 55:28.557
biting each other.

55:30.860 --> 55:32.562
You know the big
flies that bite?

55:34.429 --> 55:38.567
I think we call
them horseflies maybe.

55:39.469 --> 55:41.304
We call them bull flies.

55:43.405 --> 55:44.907
Because they charge at us.

55:49.311 --> 55:53.182
They come from the earth when
they smell sweat and blood.

56:06.362 --> 56:11.300
One charges at a boy, bites him.

56:13.402 --> 56:14.436
He is angry.

56:16.237 --> 56:19.141
The boy fires his weapon
and the rest join him.

56:20.342 --> 56:21.643
It is a frenzy.

56:25.947 --> 56:28.882
The frenzy, they will
desire to feel it again

56:28.884 --> 56:30.552
for the rest of their lives.

56:39.594 --> 56:42.931
We heard the shots and
we ran to our homes.

57:08.625 --> 57:09.858
I had two sons.

57:12.061 --> 57:14.097
And the youngest had
beautiful daughter.

57:17.965 --> 57:22.572
You were a witness but
you don't remember.

57:24.639 --> 57:26.141
You are fortunate.

57:32.114 --> 57:34.483
But we are no longer victims.

58:09.851 --> 58:11.687
You take them.

58:14.523 --> 58:15.692
You take them.

58:42.184 --> 58:43.184
G'day.

58:43.186 --> 58:44.985
Hey, hey, hey.

58:44.987 --> 58:46.387
Please, get other taxi.

58:46.389 --> 58:47.688
I'm not going far.

58:47.690 --> 58:49.055
I'm finished for the day.

58:49.057 --> 58:50.724
- Hey just drive, pal.
- See there is no light here.

58:51.561 --> 58:52.860
You need to get up.

58:52.862 --> 58:54.594
Just drive the
fucking cabbie, mate.

58:54.596 --> 58:55.429
- I'm not getting out!
- I'm asking you

58:55.431 --> 58:56.264
to get out now.

58:56.266 --> 58:57.231
Drive!

58:57.233 --> 58:58.965
You're a taxi, fine!

58:58.967 --> 58:59.800
Fuckin!

59:00.637 --> 59:01.601
Look at this!

59:01.603 --> 59:03.737
Get out!

59:03.739 --> 59:04.806
Hello.

59:06.641 --> 59:07.474
Get out!

59:07.476 --> 59:08.476
You all right?

59:08.478 --> 59:10.177
You all right, mate.

59:10.179 --> 59:11.345
Get out!

59:11.347 --> 59:12.845
She's all right,
settle down, mate.

59:12.847 --> 59:14.146
All right, settle down.

59:14.148 --> 59:16.349
All right, all right, all right!

59:19.054 --> 59:20.722
You have no right!

01:00:33.228 --> 01:00:34.528
Hello?

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.427
Dan.

01:00:35.429 --> 01:00:37.432
It is my daughter, it is Mariam.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.635
They are all dead.

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:42.739
All the families.

01:00:45.974 --> 01:00:48.344
And you buried them yourself?

01:00:51.179 --> 01:00:54.149
Yes, we buried
with our own hands.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.889
But there were many.

01:01:03.391 --> 01:01:07.362
Perhaps my tears
made me blind.

01:01:10.632 --> 01:01:12.601
Let me check the
dates and the times.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:30.383
Sebastian, I have a
contract with the Red Cross.

01:01:30.385 --> 01:01:31.818
No.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.220
They can
help you find her.

01:01:33.222 --> 01:01:34.157
No.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.059
Look, nothing
bad's gonna happen.

01:01:42.764 --> 01:01:44.398
Are you here legally?

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.932
Of course.

01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:47.901
I have every citizenship proof.

01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:49.135
Sorry, it's okay.

01:01:49.137 --> 01:01:51.438
My passport and my
certificate of marriage,

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.340
my driver licence
and my tax returns.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.478
I understand, it's okay.

01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:13.729
What if she is alive?

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.199
What then?

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:20.269
I'll help you find her.

01:02:23.905 --> 01:02:25.641
But you'll need to tell Anishka.

01:03:24.565 --> 01:03:26.099
Yay!

01:03:28.737 --> 01:03:30.139
The drier will conk out next.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.840
We're in here.

01:03:33.842 --> 01:03:35.777
Oh,
where are you going?

01:03:39.614 --> 01:03:41.016
This is the Red Cross.

01:03:42.351 --> 01:03:44.383
Do you want me to
do this for you?

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.853
I can take the documents in.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:46.820
No, no, no.

01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:47.720
It's all right with me.

01:03:47.722 --> 01:03:49.054
Okay, you stay here, okay?

01:03:49.056 --> 01:03:50.557
Stay here, I'll be right back.

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:51.724
- You sure you wanna go in?
- Stay here.

01:03:51.726 --> 01:03:52.559
Absolutely.

01:03:52.561 --> 01:03:53.427
Stay right there.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:54.760
Dan.

01:03:54.762 --> 01:03:56.031
It's okay, stay there.

01:04:12.347 --> 01:04:13.181
Sebastian.

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.351
This is Janine.

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:18.184
Hi, Sebastian.

01:04:18.186 --> 01:04:19.653
Hi, how are you?

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:22.155
Now Janine needs to
photocopy your documents.

01:04:22.157 --> 01:04:23.389
- It's all right.
- No I actually

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:24.257
- need to keep this one.
- It's okay.

01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:26.226
She needs to photocopy these

01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:28.530
and you need to
fill in this form.

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.298
I'll be right back.

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.134
All right.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.400
It's okay.

01:04:34.402 --> 01:04:35.635
You're sure of her?

01:04:35.637 --> 01:04:37.403
She's a good friend.

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:38.737
She looks dangerous.

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.175
She's not dangerous at all.

01:04:42.677 --> 01:04:44.443
Now this is an application form.

01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:46.313
We fill this in just one by one.

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:47.479
Yeah.

01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:48.548
- Dan.
- Give it back to Janine.

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:51.550
Dan, I'm really sorry.

01:04:51.552 --> 01:04:52.818
You know I didn't
want to come here.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.655
I know.

01:04:56.391 --> 01:04:58.590
You are true friend of mine.

01:04:58.592 --> 01:05:00.228
I will show you my new house.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:02.762
I'd love that.

01:05:02.764 --> 01:05:04.296
But first we fill
in the form, yeah?

01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:05.134
Yeah.

01:05:08.302 --> 01:05:09.802
This place is very dangerous.

01:05:09.804 --> 01:05:11.070
I understand.

01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:11.973
So date of birth.

01:05:13.775 --> 01:05:15.141
This is the main...

01:05:15.143 --> 01:05:16.342
Bathroom, yeah.

01:05:16.344 --> 01:05:17.443
Yeah
it's the main bathroom

01:05:17.445 --> 01:05:20.646
where you place the tub and

01:05:20.648 --> 01:05:21.847
make it just perfect.

01:05:21.849 --> 01:05:23.715
A little bit of
painting and make it

01:05:23.717 --> 01:05:25.654
a good place to live in, yeah.

01:05:27.489 --> 01:05:28.389
Nice and strong.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.724
Yeah, very strong.

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.695
Ah there's fleas.

01:05:36.697 --> 01:05:38.231
It's a old carpet.

01:05:38.233 --> 01:05:40.803
This is the reason Anishka
doesn't like coming here.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:51.614
You got some nice
boards here I think.

01:05:52.514 --> 01:05:54.347
- Yeah, oh.
- Yeah.

01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:57.184
Oh really we can actually,

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.385
it's a good wood, man.

01:05:58.387 --> 01:05:59.653
That's right.

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:00.487
Yeah, it's a good wood.

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.387
They're good boards.

01:06:01.389 --> 01:06:02.755
Do you wanna pull it up?

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:04.724
Get rid of the whole thing,
get rid of the fleas?

01:06:04.726 --> 01:06:06.695
Yes, yes, please, let's do it.

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.266
They're beautiful.

01:06:14.268 --> 01:06:15.901
- Yeah?
- They're beautiful,

01:06:15.903 --> 01:06:17.405
they're beautiful.

01:06:46.934 --> 01:06:47.900
You good?

01:06:47.902 --> 01:06:50.306
It's good, yeah.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:01.684
Thanks.

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:04.016
I suppose I could do you.

01:07:04.018 --> 01:07:04.853
Yup.

01:07:10.525 --> 01:07:11.360
Oh dear.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:15.697
Running water.

01:07:17.364 --> 01:07:18.932
The world is full of miracles.

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:22.135
Yeah.

01:07:22.137 --> 01:07:23.302
You're gonna want a hand

01:07:23.304 --> 01:07:25.704
sanding those floors in there.

01:07:25.706 --> 01:07:27.273
You would do that?

01:07:27.275 --> 01:07:28.344
Yeah.

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.778
You would help me?

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.512
Yeah.

01:07:33.514 --> 01:07:36.150
Of course I'd help you.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.318
That's good.

01:07:45.559 --> 01:07:47.360
Where have you been?

01:07:47.362 --> 01:07:48.260
Shh.

01:07:48.262 --> 01:07:49.864
Don't use that trick with me.

01:07:53.134 --> 01:07:54.603
I've been to our new house.

01:07:55.903 --> 01:07:56.972
The floor is good good.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:01.474
Dan helped me tear
up the carpets.

01:08:01.476 --> 01:08:02.644
Look at the time, eh?

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.345
I'm sorry.

01:08:06.347 --> 01:08:08.150
But I've never been so happy.

01:08:11.018 --> 01:08:12.387
Never in my life.

01:08:15.023 --> 01:08:16.889
I better have a shower.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:18.059
Sit with me.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.354
What's it?

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.139
There we go.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.176
I have a very strong heartbeat.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.185
Do you wanna know the sex?

01:09:20.154 --> 01:09:21.053
Yeah.

01:09:21.055 --> 01:09:22.321
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.259
Okay, let's have a look.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:26.929
There we are.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.197
It's a girl.

01:09:42.644 --> 01:09:43.479
You okay?

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.015
Aw.

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.725
It's good to see
you here together.

01:09:58.225 --> 01:10:01.029
Now, I would like
to talk about Eve.

01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:04.265
Do you make time
to remember her?

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:10.972
We used to.

01:10:13.975 --> 01:10:15.476
We had lots of photos up.

01:10:19.346 --> 01:10:21.684
And then we felt we
should try to move on.

01:10:23.551 --> 01:10:25.220
That's
understandable.

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:30.391
I've been thinking
about her a lot lately.

01:10:34.695 --> 01:10:36.928
Well I can recommend
some good people

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.600
to offer support if you need it.

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:44.803
The complications
around Eve's birth

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:46.505
is obviously a concern.

01:10:46.507 --> 01:10:49.677
And with a second pregnancy
the risks are higher.

01:10:51.479 --> 01:10:53.278
What are the figures?

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.016
Well it's hard to say.

01:10:57.484 --> 01:10:59.684
Well, might give it a go, eh?

01:10:59.686 --> 01:11:02.021
- Dan, please.
- No, no, that's fine.

01:11:02.023 --> 01:11:03.057
It's a fair question.

01:11:04.591 --> 01:11:09.530
Around 15% of foetuses affected
by a placental abruption died

01:11:10.698 --> 01:11:14.267
and there is one in
four chance that Josie

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.468
will develop the
condition again.

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:20.174
Now Josie, for you personally
the risks are low but there,

01:11:24.512 --> 01:11:26.015
- Excuse me.
- Mmm.

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.018
Dan.

01:11:30.051 --> 01:11:31.351
Dan.

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:34.657
You all right to
drive yourself home?

01:13:14.221 --> 01:13:15.224
Is it him?

01:13:19.927 --> 01:13:20.863
With the gun?

01:13:27.769 --> 01:13:29.570
Yeah.

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.478
Yup.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.199
Busy night.

01:13:58.265 --> 01:13:59.268
Not bad.

01:14:00.134 --> 01:14:02.101
Did you have a nice evening off?

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:02.971
Mmm.

01:14:13.314 --> 01:14:14.282
What is wrong?

01:14:17.217 --> 01:14:20.318
I must
tell you something.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.821
Okay.

01:14:21.823 --> 01:14:24.059
You'll have
many feelings about it.

01:14:29.931 --> 01:14:31.032
What is it?

01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:39.807
I want you to know

01:14:41.609 --> 01:14:44.947
once I had another
wife with two sons.

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:51.517
And I once had another daughter.

01:14:51.519 --> 01:14:52.988
I thought they were all dead.

01:14:55.323 --> 01:14:58.226
But my daughter
could be still alive.

01:14:59.594 --> 01:15:00.695
Her name is Mariam.

01:15:04.364 --> 01:15:06.065
So we could see
from the scarification

01:15:06.067 --> 01:15:08.267
and from the ring
that it was him.

01:15:08.269 --> 01:15:10.902
Well maybe he, you
should go to the police.

01:15:10.904 --> 01:15:12.304
He could be a war criminal.

01:15:12.306 --> 01:15:15.141
He's not, he's not a
criminal, he's not a criminal.

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:19.178
He's standing there with
a gun to somebody's head.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.013
It's obvious why he
doesn't want it exhibited.

01:15:22.015 --> 01:15:23.516
He's been manipulating you.

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:25.049
Is there any way
I can you know,

01:15:25.051 --> 01:15:27.820
just pull out of this festival?

01:15:27.822 --> 01:15:28.720
Why?

01:15:28.722 --> 01:15:31.057
What is the whole point of it?

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.561
Don't sabotage
yourself now, Dan.

01:15:36.097 --> 01:15:37.099
On a happier note,

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.936
I know I said we wouldn't
buy anything just yet but

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:44.572
I couldn't help it!

01:15:48.109 --> 01:15:48.944
Tada!

01:15:50.344 --> 01:15:51.777
- For you.
- Wow, so many.

01:15:51.779 --> 01:15:54.013
- And for you, my darling.
- Thank you.

01:15:54.015 --> 01:15:54.850
Thank you.

01:15:58.653 --> 01:15:59.884
Oh, they're beautiful.

01:15:59.886 --> 01:16:01.889
Jos, which one do you want?

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.893
And they do come
with the heel.

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.032
Thank you.

01:16:19.306 --> 01:16:20.141
To Dan.

01:16:21.809 --> 01:16:22.978
Soon to be father

01:16:23.944 --> 01:16:26.312
and his lovely wife.

01:16:26.314 --> 01:16:28.380
Ooh, sorry, has he
popped the question yet?

01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:29.514
Nah.

01:16:35.523 --> 01:16:40.529
No one can ever replace
your beautiful Eve.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:46.132
She was a perfect package

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.971
and we all ache to
hold her each day.

01:16:49.971 --> 01:16:52.740
But life goes on

01:16:53.975 --> 01:16:58.614
even though sometimes
you wish it wouldn't

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.848
and there are times you
think you're doing okay,

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.315
that you think
you're gonna make it

01:17:03.317 --> 01:17:06.154
and then you'll see something or

01:17:07.555 --> 01:17:08.856
hear a song and,

01:17:10.557 --> 01:17:13.060
you'll feel exactly like
you did the day she died.

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:21.970
But there will come a day

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:25.907
when the thought
of your little girl

01:17:27.274 --> 01:17:29.443
will bring a smile
before it brings a tear.

01:17:35.649 --> 01:17:40.052
To Dan and Josie, soon
to be wonderful parents.

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:48.230
Thank you Graham.

01:17:58.939 --> 01:18:00.505
There's
still one more.

01:18:00.507 --> 01:18:02.344
Oh blimey, gosh.

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.148
You've been shopping, girl.

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:10.650
Nish.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:11.987
You need to stop talking.

01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:15.553
I can't hear any more.

01:18:15.555 --> 01:18:16.755
But I've only ever wanted...

01:18:16.757 --> 01:18:19.259
I have to catch up.

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:20.696
Stop, please.

01:18:22.262 --> 01:18:25.100
I'm heartbroken for you
that you lost your family.

01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:28.470
But I'm,

01:18:30.905 --> 01:18:32.237
I'm very angry.

01:18:32.239 --> 01:18:33.472
Of course.

01:18:33.474 --> 01:18:35.107
No, stop please.

01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:36.308
Please, just.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.977
Sebastian, stop, Sebastian.

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:39.611
- Sebastian stop!
- You and Kamli.

01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:40.512
Stop.

01:18:40.514 --> 01:18:41.882
It is not for me that you lied.

01:18:47.988 --> 01:18:50.759
I don't need protecting,
I'm not a child.

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.693
Who am I to you?

01:18:54.695 --> 01:18:55.861
Who am I to you?

01:18:55.863 --> 01:18:57.696
- You are everything.
- Who am I to?

01:18:57.698 --> 01:18:58.630
You are everything.

01:18:58.632 --> 01:18:59.467
Who?

01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:05.072
Everything.

01:19:12.012 --> 01:19:15.481
I need you to stay at
the house for a few days.

01:19:15.483 --> 01:19:16.315
Nah, it's too hard...

01:19:16.317 --> 01:19:17.152
Just a few days.

01:19:21.055 --> 01:19:22.157
So I can catch up.

01:19:24.257 --> 01:19:26.427
- Now please...
- This is doing my head in.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.363
Now, please.

01:19:30.363 --> 01:19:32.134
We need to resolve
this, let's talk.

01:19:34.268 --> 01:19:35.136
Let's talk.

01:19:59.426 --> 01:20:00.427
Sebastian?

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:11.972
I told Anishka.

01:20:16.844 --> 01:20:18.180
Did she throw you out?

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.184
She needed space.

01:20:25.185 --> 01:20:27.889
I'm tired, I will skip
choir practise tonight.

01:20:38.332 --> 01:20:40.601
There's something I
need to talk to you about.

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.306
That photograph.

01:20:45.472 --> 01:20:46.640
The man with the gun.

01:20:49.976 --> 01:20:51.145
That's you, isn't it?

01:20:57.717 --> 01:21:00.154
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:21:02.222 --> 01:21:04.255
Now you are judging me.

01:21:04.257 --> 01:21:05.594
I'm not judging you.

01:21:08.595 --> 01:21:12.433
Look, just be straight
with me for once, okay?

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:14.135
Get out.

01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.237
Get out!

01:21:19.239 --> 01:21:20.473
You lied to me.

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.141
Never!

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:23.612
You lied to yourself.

01:21:25.012 --> 01:21:27.278
You see the scared black
man kneeling on the ground

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.214
and you think it must be me?

01:21:29.216 --> 01:21:31.683
That's bullshit!

01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:36.523
Get out!

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:39.592
I remember everything!

01:21:39.594 --> 01:21:41.427
It was a war!

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:43.398
I killed the man who
killed my family!

01:21:44.564 --> 01:21:45.731
And I would do it
again and again

01:21:45.733 --> 01:21:47.235
and any man would!

01:21:52.739 --> 01:21:55.007
Now before they killed my son,

01:21:55.009 --> 01:21:56.677
before they butchered my son,

01:21:58.679 --> 01:22:01.280
my son said to me,
"Father, don't worry.

01:22:01.282 --> 01:22:04.650
"I will tell God everything
and he will make it right."

01:22:04.652 --> 01:22:07.055
He was only five years
old, five years old!

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.882
Just do what you can, Jos.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.051
It's bleeding.

01:22:42.222 --> 01:22:44.223
I can't, you need stitches.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:46.058
They're expecting
you at the surgery.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.025
I'm fine.

01:22:47.027 --> 01:22:48.563
You need to see the doctor!

01:22:54.068 --> 01:22:55.968
Are you going to report him?

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.469
He attacked you.

01:22:57.471 --> 01:22:58.907
You weren't there!

01:23:05.179 --> 01:23:06.847
I'll drive myself.

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:12.186
Dan, Dan, your phone.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.303
Anishka?

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.807
Hi, hi, it's Josie Avril.

01:23:33.841 --> 01:23:34.808
Dan's partner.

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.177
How are you?

01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:42.548
I'm good.

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.319
Look, I need to
show you something.

01:24:04.605 --> 01:24:05.905
That was quick.

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.940
Sorry, Josie, it's me.

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.441
Can I talk to Dan please?

01:24:09.443 --> 01:24:10.776
He's upstairs,
what do you want?

01:24:10.778 --> 01:24:12.343
I just want to talk to him.

01:24:12.345 --> 01:24:13.845
- Allow me to talk to him.
- I'm sorry, please leave.

01:24:13.847 --> 01:24:15.647
You know, to hurt
Dan is unforgivable.

01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:18.217
I never ever wanted
to hurt anyone.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.818
So please allow
me to talk to him.

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.153
You should have
told him the truth.

01:24:21.155 --> 01:24:22.053
Yeah I know.

01:24:22.055 --> 01:24:23.321
Please, let me just talk to him.

01:24:23.323 --> 01:24:24.757
I just want to apologise to him.

01:24:24.759 --> 01:24:26.558
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Please allow me.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.593
Dan can't help you
anymore, Sebastian.

01:24:28.595 --> 01:24:29.428
Please allow me.

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:46.514
Do you miss it?

01:24:52.686 --> 01:24:55.722
I did, when I stopped.

01:24:58.257 --> 01:25:02.764
But ballet's not an easy life.

01:25:04.865 --> 01:25:07.301
It's not as romantic
as it looks.

01:25:10.604 --> 01:25:11.472
How long to go?

01:25:13.307 --> 01:25:14.509
A few months.

01:25:16.143 --> 01:25:16.978
Must be a girl.

01:25:18.679 --> 01:25:20.014
You're carrying high.

01:25:27.054 --> 01:25:29.157
Are you all right, Anishka?

01:25:34.261 --> 01:25:35.863
Sebastian's a good man.

01:25:36.697 --> 01:25:38.365
I'm sure he is.

01:25:53.814 --> 01:25:55.813
I don't think anyone
can keep their life

01:25:55.815 --> 01:25:58.185
hidden like that
without paying a price.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:01.553
I think he needs help.

01:26:01.555 --> 01:26:02.821
You mean counselling.

01:26:02.823 --> 01:26:04.723
He's been through so much.

01:26:04.725 --> 01:26:05.592
So have you.

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.363
Losing your daughter.

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:14.569
It hasn't been easy.

01:26:19.105 --> 01:26:20.207
No pictures though.

01:26:22.676 --> 01:26:23.644
What do you mean?

01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:29.848
No pictures of
you during the worst

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:31.152
moment of your life.

01:26:37.123 --> 01:26:41.061
Losing everything,
burying your dead,

01:26:42.863 --> 01:26:44.932
hope gone.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.970
Dignity, gone.

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.809
There are no pictures
of you in hell.

01:27:12.225 --> 01:27:14.261
When you lost everything,

01:27:15.695 --> 01:27:18.899
I bet people showed
some respect.

01:27:21.969 --> 01:27:23.136
Looked the other way.

01:27:25.806 --> 01:27:26.640
Eh?

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:51.365
How dare you.

01:28:07.514 --> 01:28:08.516
Oh my god.

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.011
Who are you?

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.015
Hmm?

01:29:18.185 --> 01:29:20.218
I'm going crazy.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:21.655
Except I can't.

01:29:24.057 --> 01:29:25.059
Because I'm pregnant

01:29:26.259 --> 01:29:28.096
and I have a baby to look after

01:29:29.029 --> 01:29:31.599
and a 12 hour workday tomorrow.

01:29:50.216 --> 01:29:54.721
You have put our family
in danger, Sebastian.

01:30:04.097 --> 01:30:05.600
I won't be moving here.

01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:12.573
And I don't want you.

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:21.349
You are on your own.

01:30:41.135 --> 01:30:42.603
You can't do this.

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:51.312
Dan.

01:30:52.779 --> 01:30:53.648
You need help.

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:08.026
I spoke to Anishka.

01:31:08.028 --> 01:31:08.861
What?

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:09.697
I rang her.

01:31:11.731 --> 01:31:12.733
Dan, Dan!

01:31:18.604 --> 01:31:19.905
Just stop for a minute

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.676
and tell me what you
think you're doing.

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.479
I'm going to Syria.

01:31:25.945 --> 01:31:27.178
I'm doing my job.

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:29.684
Do you remember what
the neurologist told us?

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:36.321
Look, let me call Graham.

01:31:36.323 --> 01:31:37.291
Just come inside.

01:31:39.059 --> 01:31:39.894
Please.

01:31:41.027 --> 01:31:42.427
Please, just stay here with me.

01:31:42.429 --> 01:31:43.597
Just for tonight.

01:31:46.265 --> 01:31:47.100
We need you.

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:50.938
Sebastian came here.

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.005
What do you mean?

01:31:55.007 --> 01:31:56.943
I don't want him
coming here, Dan.

01:31:58.278 --> 01:31:59.280
Please, Dan!

01:32:01.181 --> 01:32:02.348
Dan!

01:32:05.018 --> 01:32:05.987
Dan, please!

01:32:50.425 --> 01:32:52.675
Verily we belong to God
and verily to Him do we return.

01:33:31.438 --> 01:33:32.273
Hello!

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:33.975
Hey!

01:33:35.341 --> 01:33:36.810
Are you in there?

01:33:51.257 --> 01:33:52.558
Now listen.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.759
I don't know what
he's up to in there

01:33:53.761 --> 01:33:56.093
but he was making
a hell of a racket.

01:33:56.095 --> 01:33:57.929
I knocked on the door but I am.

01:33:57.931 --> 01:33:59.966
Yep, all right, thanks.

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:03.471
Sebastian?

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:19.720
Sebastian!

01:34:31.364 --> 01:34:32.599
Dan, Dan, Dan!

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.232
What's happening?

01:34:35.234 --> 01:34:36.300
It's okay, it's okay,

01:34:36.302 --> 01:34:37.134
- it's okay.
- What's going on?

01:34:37.136 --> 01:34:38.236
Wait, what, what?

01:34:38.238 --> 01:34:39.070
- It's okay sweety.
- What?

01:34:39.072 --> 01:34:40.138
Tell me, tell me,

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:41.505
- tell me.
- Sebastian tried

01:34:41.507 --> 01:34:42.773
- to kill himself.
- What?

01:34:48.448 --> 01:34:49.250
What?

01:34:50.984 --> 01:34:52.152
Medic!

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:26.554
Dan?

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:28.823
Hello?

01:35:31.391 --> 01:35:32.225
Dan?

01:35:37.597 --> 01:35:38.399
Where are you?

01:35:41.234 --> 01:35:42.068
Dan?

01:35:46.105 --> 01:35:47.537
Jos.

01:35:47.539 --> 01:35:50.808
Yeah, yeah I'm here.

01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:51.644
I'm scared.

01:35:56.850 --> 01:35:59.320
Just tell me where you are.

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:25.179
It's all right.

01:37:18.675 --> 01:37:19.800
Come on.

01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:25.139
Thank you very
much, very much.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.008
Hello.

01:37:30.008 --> 01:37:31.342
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.477
Nice to see you.

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:33.443
Nice to see you too.

01:37:33.445 --> 01:37:35.012
Hello, all right.

01:37:35.014 --> 01:37:35.847
- I'm fine.
- Anishka.

01:37:35.849 --> 01:37:37.214
Hello my brother.

01:37:37.216 --> 01:37:39.483
I'm good, thank you.

01:37:39.485 --> 01:37:42.720
Open the
door, open the door.

01:37:42.722 --> 01:37:43.854
Slow down, slow down,

01:37:43.856 --> 01:37:46.426
you're gonna trip on that step.

01:38:06.345 --> 01:38:07.344
You good?

01:38:07.346 --> 01:38:08.181
Yeah.

01:38:12.185 --> 01:38:13.483
Hey Nish.

01:38:13.485 --> 01:38:14.652
Hello,
Dan, how are you?

01:38:14.654 --> 01:38:15.652
Good, how are you?

01:38:15.654 --> 01:38:16.856
I'm good, thank you.

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:20.392
Is he up?

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:21.726
He's out in the back.

01:38:21.728 --> 01:38:23.430
I've got some news for him.

01:38:30.970 --> 01:38:31.804
Can I help?

01:38:54.226 --> 01:38:55.259
Hey, Seb.

01:38:55.261 --> 01:38:56.195
Dan.

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:02.569
They found Mariam.

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:08.108
She wants to meet you.

01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:12.011
Yeah.

01:39:18.717 --> 01:39:19.653
My friend.

01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:28.195
You must exhibit photograph

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.597
from my village.

01:39:34.266 --> 01:39:35.970
The man with the gun,

01:39:38.805 --> 01:39:40.073
he is a part of me.

01:39:45.511 --> 01:39:46.447
Yeah.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.315
Yeah.

01:41:52.471 --> 01:41:54.073
It's all amazing.

01:42:00.012 --> 01:42:01.012
Okay, everyone ready?

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.516
We are going to sing now.

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.383
