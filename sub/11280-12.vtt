CHRIS ROCK:
One of the biggest problems

00:05.206 --> 00:07.508
I had in school
was I got no respect.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.178
People disrespected
me at lunch.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.279
Hey! That's my roll.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.247
Shut up.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.317
They disrespected me
in the halls.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.385
Hey, man,
that's my coat.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.419
Shut up!

00:20.654 --> 00:23.357
They even disrespected me
during fire drills.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.258
Oh, Chris, you
go back inside

00:24.292 --> 00:27.195
and make sure
nothing valuable burns.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.130
I tried to make friends.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.398
I even ran for office.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.201
I just couldn't
get any respect.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.735
Hey!
Shut up.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.071
You. Pick those up.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.272
What if I don't?

00:38.306 --> 00:40.508
The only kids in school
that got respect from everyone

00:40.541 --> 00:41.709
were the hall monitors.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.477
I'll put you
in detention so long,

00:43.511 --> 00:45.413
your kids will get
out of school before you.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.582
Hall monitors were the closest
thing we had to the police.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.185
They couldn't arrest you,
but they could write you up.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.253
Thanks.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.522
Oh, and if you're black,
they could shoot you.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.190
You need to be in class.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.492
All right.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.761
Being on the wrong side
of a hall monitor

01:00.794 --> 01:03.231
was like being
on the wrong side of the law.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.267
Nobody messed
with those guys.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.502
What you going
to do now... Coco Puff?

01:08.536 --> 01:11.339
The only thing I could do--

01:11.372 --> 01:16.344
join the few, the proud,
the hall monitors.

01:16.377 --> 01:26.420
Captioning sponsored by

01:26.420 --> 01:36.430
Captioning sponsored by

01:49.177 --> 01:50.278
Man, a hall monitor.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.479
How'd you get in?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.615
Jesse Jackson
threatened a boycott.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.384
Oh, I asked Mrs. Milone.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.486
She said as long as
I kept my grades up,

01:58.519 --> 01:59.820
there'll be no problem.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.156
Man, I always wanted

02:02.190 --> 02:03.090
to be a hall monitor.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.293
What Greg imagined
hall monitors did

02:05.326 --> 02:08.329
and what they actually did
were two different things.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.832
Hall Dog One to Hall Dog Two.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.501
I have a group of
violators. Sector one.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.436
On my signal... Go! Go! Go!

02:15.469 --> 02:17.171
Hall monitors! Down!

02:17.205 --> 02:19.307
Get on the ground! Go!

02:19.340 --> 02:20.674
That's what happens to punks

02:20.708 --> 02:22.176
who linger
after the second bell.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.377
Book 'em, guys.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.846
We got a runner!

02:25.879 --> 02:27.315
This is so awesome.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.183
Yeah, I know, and
the best thing is,

02:29.217 --> 02:30.651
I'm finally going
to get some respect.

02:30.684 --> 02:33.187
Watch out, Othello.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.189
It'll be different when
you get your armband on.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.591
Yeah, if I wrap it
around a baseball bat.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.661
When my mother worked,
she had two jobs--

02:40.694 --> 02:43.231
her job and complaining
about her job.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.233
You will not believe
what this woman

02:45.266 --> 02:46.434
did at my job today.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.202
Did she wake anybody up?

02:48.236 --> 02:49.303
What?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.372
When I first walked in,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.241
she had the nerve
to smile in my face

02:53.274 --> 02:54.475
and then look up at the clock,

02:54.508 --> 02:56.810
and say, "Ooh,
train running late?"

02:56.844 --> 02:58.379
I don't know who
she thinks she is,

02:58.412 --> 02:59.747
but she is not my boss.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.749
Every time my mother
got a new job,

03:01.782 --> 03:03.484
there was always
someone she hated.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.353
At the hospital, it was Tammy.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.687
So Tammy says to set

03:06.720 --> 03:08.322
the defibrillator to 200.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.323
I know how to set

03:09.357 --> 03:10.324
the defibrillator.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.426
I'm gonna defibrillate her.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.861
At the fire station,
it was Betty.

03:13.894 --> 03:14.928
That damn Betty

03:14.962 --> 03:15.929
set the water pressure

03:15.963 --> 03:16.930
at a hundred pounds

03:16.964 --> 03:17.765
per square inch,

03:17.798 --> 03:19.900
when she know
I told her to set it

03:19.933 --> 03:22.470
at 130 pounds per square inch.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.372
I should've turned
the hose on her.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.639
And at NASA, it was Belinda.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.575
Can you believe that heifer?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.377
I told her to set
the aft booster

03:29.410 --> 03:31.445
at 25,000 feet per second,

03:31.479 --> 03:33.414
and she looked at
me like I'm crazy.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.449
Now, if we would've got stuck
in the ionosphere,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.485
she would've been like, "Oh,
well, what we gonna do now?"

03:37.518 --> 03:39.253
More Tang?

03:39.287 --> 03:41.255
And at the office,
it was Charmaine.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.391
And then when
I got back from lunch,

03:43.424 --> 03:44.792
she done move my stapler.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.827
Talking about, "That's
not where it goes."

03:46.860 --> 03:48.396
I told her I put it there,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.764
so that's where it goes.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.269
He didn't hear a word she said.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.837
Come on, baby, get up.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.539
You gotta get ready for work.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.507
He's up, woman.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.614
Chris, your job begins
the moment the bell rings.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.749
I know, and I'm supposed
to keep things orderly.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.817
If anyone breaks a rule,

04:09.850 --> 04:11.051
I'm supposed
to issue a citation.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.821
The first citation is
considered a warning.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.489
The second is detention,

04:15.523 --> 04:16.857
The third is suspension.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.360
And most importantly,
after that second bell rings,

04:19.393 --> 04:20.594
any student out in the hall

04:20.628 --> 04:21.829
has to have
a hall pass.
Correct.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.497
Here is your citation book

04:23.531 --> 04:24.898
and your armband.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.500
Good luck.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.502
Now, what if I give
someone a citation

04:28.536 --> 04:29.570
but they don't want to take it?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.439
Issue them a citation.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.307
But if they didn't take
the first citation,

04:33.341 --> 04:34.375
why would they take the second?

04:34.408 --> 04:36.777
If you get a citation
for not taking a citation,

04:36.810 --> 04:40.314
that's another citation and
that's an automatic suspension.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.114
But what if...?

04:41.148 --> 04:42.716
If you have
any more questions,

04:42.750 --> 04:44.051
pretend I'm still here

04:44.084 --> 04:46.620
and I said, "Issue a citation."

04:46.654 --> 04:49.056
I'd like to issue a citation
upside her head.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.993
Tonya tried playing
with me and Drew,

04:53.026 --> 04:54.995
but we would never cooperate.

04:55.028 --> 04:55.996
Mama.

04:56.029 --> 04:56.997
What?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.832
Chris and Drew won't play right.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.003
This is how we played dolls.

05:03.036 --> 05:06.039
Hey, anybody want
to play dolls with me?

05:06.073 --> 05:07.508
Sure.
Sure.

05:09.743 --> 05:13.414
I know your style,
Bed-Stuy Dragon Fist.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.550
I know your style,
Park Slope Flying Tiger.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.693
Stop.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.361
It's not funny.

05:27.395 --> 05:30.664
This is how
we played hopscotch.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.865
Go, fish.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.640
Y'all stop! Ma!

05:39.673 --> 05:41.775
And this is how
we played jump rope.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.582
You play too much. Come on.

05:48.616 --> 05:49.650
No, you're the one messing up.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.718
I'm not doing nothing.

05:50.751 --> 05:51.919
Shut up.
Shut up.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.921
Ahh!

05:53.954 --> 05:54.888
Ah!

05:54.922 --> 05:56.890
Stop!

05:57.725 --> 05:58.859
Ma!

05:58.892 --> 06:00.060
Get o me!

06:00.093 --> 06:01.995
Tonya, why don't you invite
some friends

06:02.029 --> 06:03.664
to come over to play?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.966
Because you say you ain't want
none of those raggedy kids

06:05.999 --> 06:07.067
in your house.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.402
She actually said something

06:08.436 --> 06:09.503
much worse than "raggedy."

06:09.537 --> 06:11.639
Fine. You can have some
friends over, but keep them

06:11.672 --> 06:13.541
out of my room,
out of my kitchen

06:13.574 --> 06:15.676
and out of my way,
and don't bring

06:15.709 --> 06:16.877
that little crazy
girl over here.

06:16.910 --> 06:17.878
Thanks, Ma.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.580
Hey, where
you going?

06:19.613 --> 06:21.081
You're not finished yet.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.450
Get back over here.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.751
So, for the first time
in her life,

06:23.784 --> 06:25.753
Tonya had friends.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.187
A lot of people
don't know this,

06:27.220 --> 06:28.889
but Billy Ocean
invented the moonwalk.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.090
And it almost killed her.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.460
And his real name
is Leslie Charles.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.561
Did you know in Africa

06:33.594 --> 06:34.795
and Europe, they
changed the lyrics

06:34.828 --> 06:36.430
to "African" and
"European Queen"?

06:36.464 --> 06:37.731
And in Puerto Rico,

06:37.765 --> 06:39.099
they changed it
to "Drama Queen."

06:39.132 --> 06:40.634
Oh.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.735
Hey, Drew.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.036
DREW:
Hi.
What are you watching?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.672
Duel of the
Iron Fist.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.608
Ooh, I like Duel
of the Iron Fist.
Liar.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.742
Want to watch?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.444
No, that's all right.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.213
That day, my sister learned
something I already knew.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.247
When it came to Drew,

06:54.281 --> 06:56.917
you could kiss your
girlfriends good-bye.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.455
It was exciting knowing
for the first time,

07:01.489 --> 07:03.190
I wasn't going
to get walked on,

07:03.223 --> 07:04.925
stepped over or pushed around.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.194
I was finally going
to get some respect.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.463
Hey, you! Stop running.
Shut up.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.565
He must not have
seen my armband.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.468
Hey, no gum-chewing
in school.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.703
Shut up!
Shut up!

07:17.905 --> 07:20.508
Hey, no rough housing
in the halls.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.510
Shut up.
Shut up.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.744
You'd better listen
or else I'm gonna

07:23.777 --> 07:25.078
have to give you a citation.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.947
A'ight.
Well, that's better.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.749
Ow! Oh, no. Oh!

07:28.782 --> 07:32.052
No. Uh-uh. No! No. No, no.

07:32.085 --> 07:36.156
No, not the locker, not the
locker, not the locker! No!

07:37.190 --> 07:39.660
No! You can't
do this to me!

07:39.693 --> 07:41.495
I'm a hall monitor!

07:41.529 --> 07:43.597
Now I'm a locker monitor.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.705
CHRIS:
Greg. Greg.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.741
Come here.

07:54.542 --> 07:57.177
Thanks, man.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.779
What happened to you?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.247
Tried to give these
guys a citation

08:00.280 --> 08:01.915
and they shoved me
in the locker.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.083
I'm not surprised.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.718
I mean, just look at
your body language.

08:04.752 --> 08:05.886
What body language?

08:05.919 --> 08:07.254
It screams, "Ignore me."

08:07.287 --> 08:08.355
Your shoulders
are hunched over.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.658
You're staring at the ground
and you sound like a girl.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.525
Let me have that.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.260
I don't sound like a girl.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.194
You hear like a girl.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.597
And throw like a girl,
run like a girl

08:16.630 --> 08:17.765
and scream like a girl.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.733
I'm just saying--
people can hear

08:19.767 --> 08:20.768
the fear in your voice.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.702
If you want to
give out citations,

08:21.735 --> 08:23.604
you have to give them out
like you mean it.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.938
What is that for?

08:24.972 --> 08:25.773
It's my thing.

08:25.806 --> 08:29.209
Kojak had a lollipop
and I got this.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.578
Hey!

08:32.713 --> 08:33.547
What?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.748
How many times
do I have to tell you?

08:34.782 --> 08:35.883
No gum-chewing in the halls.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.651
You never told us
no gum-chewing.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.119
I'm telling you now.

08:40.988 --> 08:41.855
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.124
That explains
why Greg didn't get

08:44.157 --> 08:45.626
a date until he was 20.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.628
See?
Well, if you're
so good at it,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.296
why don't you
become a hall monitor?

08:49.329 --> 08:52.766
Who am I kidding?
Study hall is safer.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.801
Want this?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.603
No, I'll get my own.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.273
While I was learning
how to deal with people,

09:00.307 --> 09:02.676
Tonya was dealing
with being alone.

09:04.612 --> 09:05.813
Where are all your friends?

09:05.846 --> 09:07.815
I told them
they couldn't come over.

09:07.848 --> 09:08.816
Why?

09:08.849 --> 09:10.584
Because

09:10.618 --> 09:12.720
they like you better than me.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.990
Later on,
my father had evacuated

09:17.024 --> 09:19.259
to avoid Hurricane Rochelle.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.963
Man, you will not believe
what that wench did today.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.300
Julius?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.270
Unfortunately for my dad,

09:30.303 --> 09:32.640
my mother needed to talk.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.807
Julius?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.647
And she needed to talk to him.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.949
Julius?

09:43.851 --> 09:46.319
She was like a bloodhound
looking for a prisoner.

09:48.989 --> 09:49.957
Julius.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.625
Huh

09:51.659 --> 09:52.626
What are you doing in here?

09:52.660 --> 09:56.096
Oh, I was making the bed
and then I feel asleep.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.631
Liar.

09:57.665 --> 10:00.300
Oh, let me tell you
what Charmaine did today.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.772
So she says to me, "Did you just
get your hair done?"

10:04.805 --> 10:06.173
And she said it just like that.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.642
And then she passes me the card
to her hairdresser

10:08.676 --> 10:11.211
and says, "Ooh, you know, girl,
you should go to him.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.245
He's real good."

10:12.279 --> 10:14.982
I mean she got
some nerve.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.317
Her hair so short, she can't
even roll it with rice.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.986
I'm telling you, she got
one more time.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.288
Maybe she thought
you'd like her hairdresser.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.823
Uh-oh.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.725
Are you defending her?

10:24.758 --> 10:28.662
No. Um, I just thought...
maybe you took it wrong.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.731
I took it wrong?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.734
She asked me if I just
got my hair done

10:33.767 --> 10:35.803
and then hands me a card
to her hairdresser.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.806
That's like somebody
asking you if you
just took a shower

10:38.839 --> 10:40.273
and then handing you
a bar of soap.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.809
I was just trying to help.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.343
Help who?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.846
The woman has been messing with
me since the day I got there.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.347
Now you're telling me
I'm taking it wrong?

10:47.380 --> 10:48.982
Oh, no, she gonna take it wrong

10:49.016 --> 10:50.851
when I knock her
over her block head.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.452
Calm down.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.887
Calm down?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.422
Why should I calm down?

10:55.455 --> 10:58.726
Oh, so I guess
you're going to
take sides with her, too.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.828
Next thing I know, you're gonna
be passing me a card

11:00.861 --> 11:01.829
to her hairdresser.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.063
Why you getting
mad at me?

11:03.096 --> 11:06.033
This woman hands you a card
and you trying to start a fight.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.400
I am not trying
to start a fight.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.202
She's the one trying
to start a fight.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.738
I don't care who's trying
to start a fight.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.872
I'm trying to get some sleep.

11:11.905 --> 11:16.009
Well, I am so sorry for trying
to have a conversation

11:16.043 --> 11:17.878
with my husband!

11:17.911 --> 11:19.713
I've learned that when dealing
with a woman

11:19.747 --> 11:22.315
who has a problem, the last
thing she wants from a man

11:22.349 --> 11:23.717
is a solution.

11:23.751 --> 11:26.453
Later I was thinking
about Greg.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.155
And I wondered how my heroes
would handle

11:28.188 --> 11:29.890
being a hall monitor.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.825
I thought about how
Mr. T would handle it.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.327
I pity the fool who doesn't
have a hall pass.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.197
I thought about how
Dirty Harry would handle it.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.099
I know what you're thinking...

11:39.132 --> 11:41.802
Was that the first bell
or the second bell?

11:41.835 --> 11:43.904
Well, you have to ask
yourself one question--

11:43.937 --> 11:45.839
do you feel lucky?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.841
Well, do you, punk?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.343
I even thought about how
the Terminator would handle it.

11:50.377 --> 11:55.883
No citation...
I'll be black.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.420
If I was going to get
any respect,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.222
I had to act like
I deserved it.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.832
Tuck in your shirt.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.500
That felt good.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.068
Hey!

12:15.102 --> 12:18.005
You want to fight
so bad,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.339
fight the power.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.041
That felt even better.

12:27.447 --> 12:31.218
Run by here again, you're going
to get more than a citation.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.955
No shades.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.356
He's blind.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.792
No snacks.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.862
Hey, didn't you see me
come down just now?

12:41.895 --> 12:43.263
Yeah.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.265
So what, you're not going
to slap my books out of my hand

12:45.298 --> 12:47.534
call me Chim-Chim,
Yafat and Roscoe?

12:47.567 --> 12:50.037
Oh, I, uh, I got
to go to class.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.338
Oh.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.807
Well, take this with you.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.809
What's this for?

12:55.843 --> 12:58.278
I don't know, Bing,
you tell me.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.814
I wonder if this is how
the first black cop felt.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.450
Hey, pick that up!

13:03.483 --> 13:06.019
Pick up the citation, too!

13:06.053 --> 13:07.821
She must think
she lost her mind.

13:11.992 --> 13:12.893
Take off your hat.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.495
With that citation book
and an armband,

13:15.528 --> 13:18.465
I had the power
to run this joint.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.138
Hey, you, where's
your hall pass?

13:25.172 --> 13:28.341
Oh, hey, man, you had
me worried there for a minute.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.843
Greg, where's your hall pass?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.511
Funny, man.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.314
I'm not joking.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.382
You're writing me up?

13:35.415 --> 13:36.383
It's my job.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.318
Nice work.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.553
The citation doesn't seem
like a big deal,

13:40.587 --> 13:42.923
but it kept Greg from getting
a job with the FBI.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.962
I thought I had just
done my job,

13:48.996 --> 13:51.031
but Greg thought I had
done a job on him.

13:51.064 --> 13:51.999
Greg.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.034
So what are you doing
for lunch tomorrow?

13:54.067 --> 13:57.037
Staying out of the hallways,
that's what I'm doing.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.305
Listen, I was just
doing my job.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.908
I was using the bathroom.
You could have used
your discretion.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.309
Listen, I didn't want
people to think

14:02.342 --> 14:04.411
that I was going to be
soft on you just because
you were my friend.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.379
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.447
Half the school thinks
you're crazy.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.882
You're like a dog with
citation rabies.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.117
We're all scared of you.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.986
Well, it's better
than when people
weren't scared of me.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.287
Even Caruso's
leaving me alone.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.956
I used to respect you.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.992
Even though you got picked on,
made fun of and left out,

14:19.026 --> 14:20.560
at least you knew
who you were.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.595
Yeah, I was the kid
who got picked on,

14:22.629 --> 14:24.464
made fun of and left out.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.465
Greg.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.968
I'm eating lunch by myself.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.105
Chris.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.609
Can I speak to you for a moment?

14:36.643 --> 14:37.544
Yeah.

14:37.577 --> 14:41.048
So, Chris, I hear our newest
hall monitor

14:41.081 --> 14:43.050
is making a big impression.

14:43.083 --> 14:43.984
Thanks.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.986
Chris, we're friends, right?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.654
Yeah...

14:47.687 --> 14:48.555
No.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.024
I'm not part of the
hall monitor program.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.962
But, as a friend, I think
you should slow down a bit.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.263
Why?

14:56.296 --> 14:57.497
You just said I was impressive.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.999
To me, yes.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.034
But to the rest
of the students...

15:01.068 --> 15:02.970
well, they hate you.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.404
They've always hated me.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.941
True, but they used to hate you
because you were black.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.010
Now they hate you because
you're acting like a jerk.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.278
And because I'm black.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.645
So what do you mean?

15:12.679 --> 15:15.215
You judo-flipped Rodney
for wearing a hat.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.550
And I'm just doing my job.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.453
I know how aggressive
the downtrodden can get

15:20.487 --> 15:21.688
when they get a little taste
of power.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.424
But, Chris,

15:24.457 --> 15:26.093
you're just a hall monitor.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.095
Calm down.

15:28.128 --> 15:32.099
While I was thinking about
who I had turned into,

15:32.132 --> 15:35.035
my father was worried about
what he was walking into.

15:35.068 --> 15:35.902
Hey, babe.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.737
You know, I don't
understand why you

15:37.770 --> 15:38.938
just can't
listen to me.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.708
I'm upset and I want to talk
about what happened at work.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.976
I listen to you

15:43.010 --> 15:44.577
when you complain
about work.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.346
My father never complained
about work

15:46.379 --> 15:47.380
no matter what happened.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.382
One time he ran into a wall.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.417
How was work, honey?

15:50.450 --> 15:52.119
Fine.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.720
One time he got held up.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.655
Oh, how was
work, honey?

15:55.688 --> 15:57.090
Fine.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.326
One time he got
his head cut off.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.393
So how was work?

16:00.427 --> 16:02.395
Fine.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.532
Chris, let me get
a piece of that bacon.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.402
I was just making
a suggestion.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.172
Do you think I stayed married
for 14 years

16:12.205 --> 16:14.041
because I need suggestions?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.508
If I needed suggestions,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.010
I'll get a suggestion box.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.678
I need for somebody
to listen to me.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.548
I'm telling you, if Charmaine
says one more thing to me

16:21.581 --> 16:23.050
I'm going to strangle her.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.085
He knows exactly how
she feels right now.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.054
So, you just want me
to listen to you?

16:27.087 --> 16:27.954
Yes, baby.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.024
I need to know that
you're on my side.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.060
While my dad was trying
to see it my mom's way,

16:33.093 --> 16:35.528
Drew was trying
not to be seen.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.664
Up, side, pull, pull.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.333
Up, side, pull, pull.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.202
Up, side, pull, pull.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.645
Funny, Drew never stayed
out of the way

16:52.679 --> 16:55.448
when I had girls over.

16:55.482 --> 17:00.553
Later I was trying to learn
what R-E-S-P-E-C-T meant to me.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.656
Dad, how do you
get respect?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.758
Respect?
You got to earn it.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.295
How do I do that?

17:08.328 --> 17:10.830
By being the type of person
that deserves respect.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.433
But what if I am and people
still don't respect me?

17:13.466 --> 17:16.203
If you were,
then that wouldn't happen.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.837
But how am I supposed
to earn respect

17:17.870 --> 17:19.772
if people
don't respect me?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.274
Respect yourself.

17:21.308 --> 17:25.178
And how am I supposed
to do that?

17:25.212 --> 17:26.479
Do you respect me?

17:26.513 --> 17:27.380
Sure.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.581
But what if you didn't?

17:28.615 --> 17:29.716
Then what would I do?

17:29.749 --> 17:30.650
Break my arm.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.419
That wouldn't make you
respect me, Chris.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.221
That would make you
scared of me.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.855
When you respect people,
you aren't afraid of them.

17:35.888 --> 17:40.093
When you're afraid of them,
you don't respect them.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.296
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.766
Since my mother
stopped talking,

17:46.799 --> 17:48.668
my father started listening.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.170
How was work today?

17:50.203 --> 17:51.838
That's all she needed to hear.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.874
You won't believe
what happened today.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.008
What happened?

17:56.042 --> 17:58.745
Well, see, I was supposed to
take my lunch break at 1:00,

17:58.778 --> 18:00.280
but then all of a sudden
Charmaine decides

18:00.313 --> 18:01.881
that she wants to go at 12:30.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.216
12:30?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.484
Mm-hmm. She did it on purpose,
too.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.885
She knew I was hungry
and didn't have a break.

18:05.918 --> 18:06.919
And she knew that?

18:06.953 --> 18:09.289
Mm-hmm. And not only
did she take it for one hour,

18:09.322 --> 18:11.324
she took it for an hour
and eight minutes.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.592
An hour and eight minutes?

18:12.625 --> 18:13.626
Yes. I told you
she was crazy.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.861
Yeah, she's crazy.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.796
Going to leave at 12:30 for
an hour and eight-minute lunch

18:16.829 --> 18:19.399
and you ain't had a break.
See, that's
what I'm saying.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.567
Ooh.
Crazy.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.169
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.237
Little did my mother know,
somewhere across town,

18:24.271 --> 18:25.405
this was happening.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.806
Then Rochelle had the
nerve to tell me,

18:26.839 --> 18:28.575
"Charmaine, when it comes
to makeup, less is more."

18:28.608 --> 18:29.542
Less is more?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.744
And she had the nerve
to answer my phone,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.313
and you know don't nobody
answer my phone but me.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.781
She answers your phone?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.516
And now my typewriter
ribbon is missing.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.285
I know Rochelle got
my ribbon.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.686
I can't prove it, but
I know she got it.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.588
She talked about your makeup,
answers your phone

18:41.621 --> 18:43.890
and stole your
typewriter ribbon?
Mm-hmm.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.593
I told you
that woman was crazy.
Hmm.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.564
Hey.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.800
Hey.
Listen, I just want to say

18:53.833 --> 18:56.269
I'm sorry about the
whole citation thing.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.305
Guess I just got
carried away.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.273
Yeah, no kidding.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.708
So I'll see
you later?

19:04.711 --> 19:06.413
Chris.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.680
Yeah?

19:07.714 --> 19:10.250
Want to grab
a slice for lunch?

19:10.283 --> 19:12.285
Yeah.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.287
Now I knew what
my father meant.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.257
I was never afraid of Greg,
but I sure did respect him.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.261
What about your
hall monitor post?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.462
I quit.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.896
Why?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.365
Either people are
going to respect me

19:25.398 --> 19:27.334
because I'm Chris
or they're not.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.536
Either way,
I'm still me.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.537
That's cool.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.272
So who's going
to replace you?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.206
Don't know, don't care.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.707
Here you go.

19:34.741 --> 19:35.908
What's this?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.711
W-W-B-- walking while black.

19:38.745 --> 19:43.250
* Everybody hates Chris.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.386
