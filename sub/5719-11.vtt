WEBVTT

00:00.343 --> 00:01.926
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.964 --> 00:05.134
We all deserve a break.
So we are going on a vacation

00:05.169 --> 00:07.704
to a place called the Dominican Republic.

00:07.738 --> 00:09.204
I don't wanna go on the stupid girls' trip

00:09.238 --> 00:10.712
with you and Katie anymore.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.708
The last thing I wanna do
is spend any time with you.

00:12.742 --> 00:14.276
So you think she ran away.

00:14.311 --> 00:16.878
Well, it's something we
have to consider isn't it?

00:19.316 --> 00:20.949
Mom?

00:20.983 --> 00:23.452
- Just tell me where you are.
- I'm at Dad's.

00:23.486 --> 00:25.287
I'm gonna be on the first flight there.

00:25.321 --> 00:27.322
I'm Sylvia Pratt.

00:27.356 --> 00:28.690
Sylvia.

00:30.125 --> 00:32.159
I changed my mind.

00:32.194 --> 00:35.697
I wanna come with you
and Katie on that trip.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.398
Just me and my girls.

00:45.072 --> 00:47.106
'Scuse me.

00:47.141 --> 00:48.608
Adios.

01:07.361 --> 01:09.127
Hey! I was just thinking about you.

01:09.162 --> 01:11.029
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11.064 --> 01:13.366
I'm looking forward to our
weekend together, just us.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.478
Me too.

01:14.505 --> 01:17.168
Hey, I gotta get some paperwork
done at the clinic first,

01:17.202 --> 01:18.251
but after that, I'm all yours.

01:18.331 --> 01:19.771
Hey!
Don't forget about that welcome home dinner

01:19.805 --> 01:21.205
that Lisa has planned.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.040
Okay. I'm leaving now. I'll see you soon.

01:23.075 --> 01:25.042
- Love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

01:26.645 --> 01:28.513
Hey, Phoenix? Did you hear that?

01:28.547 --> 01:31.383
Georgie'll be home soon. Yeah.

01:34.236 --> 01:35.529
Hello?

01:36.053 --> 01:38.021
Uh, yeah, speaking.

01:38.055 --> 01:39.956
Tomorrow? Um...

01:39.991 --> 01:42.493
Is there any way we can
reschedule it later?

01:42.527 --> 01:45.729
No. Okay, that's all right. I'll be here.

01:45.764 --> 01:47.130
Thanks. Bye.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.634
You're going to a lot of trouble.

01:51.668 --> 01:54.103
Well, it's a seven hour trip
from the Dominican Republic,

01:54.137 --> 01:56.506
and it's a time change,

01:56.540 --> 01:58.941
and I don't want her to worry
about feeding everybody.

01:58.975 --> 02:00.342
Right? Uh-uh...

02:00.377 --> 02:03.546
You know what? I need a sous-chef.

02:03.580 --> 02:05.815
Okay, okay. Yeah, no, I'll be there.

02:05.849 --> 02:09.618
'Kay. Yup, I'm... Mm.

02:09.651 --> 02:13.087
- How's Casey doing?
- She's great. She's still on the road.

02:13.122 --> 02:14.790
I'm gonna meet up with her in a few days.

02:14.824 --> 02:16.190
What about the cattle drive?

02:16.225 --> 02:17.559
We're gonna have to move that up.

02:17.593 --> 02:18.960
Can you leave tomorrow?

02:18.994 --> 02:20.395
That's fine with me.

02:20.430 --> 02:21.797
Hey, you're not thinking
of bringing the herd down

02:21.831 --> 02:23.632
to the fall fields by yourselves, are you?

02:23.666 --> 02:27.100
Well, we could use a third.

02:27.135 --> 02:30.438
And here is the solution
to our problem right here.

02:30.472 --> 02:32.239
- What problem is that?
- Change of plan.

02:32.273 --> 02:35.008
We're moving the cattle drive up.
We need you tomorrow.

02:35.043 --> 02:36.376
Wait. Tomorrow?

02:36.411 --> 02:37.845
Okay, a little warning would've been nice.

02:37.879 --> 02:39.847
I have a delivery, and besides,

02:39.881 --> 02:41.915
Ty and I were finally gonna
spend some time together.

02:41.949 --> 02:43.883
So you're just gonna
send me out there alone,

02:43.918 --> 02:46.185
with an arthritic old man
and an untested horse?

02:46.219 --> 02:47.887
What's my horse got to do with this?

02:47.922 --> 02:49.823
Well, we have no idea how he's
gonna react to open country,

02:49.857 --> 02:52.091
a herd of cattle.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.726
Come on, I need a team I can rely on.

02:53.761 --> 02:55.929
Buddy and me will be just fine.

02:55.963 --> 02:58.564
Yeah, but if you aren't,
I gotta pick up the slack.

02:58.598 --> 03:01.834
I-I-I need that beaten to a
soft peak meringue, thank you.

03:01.868 --> 03:04.235
Yeah, light and airy.

03:04.270 --> 03:06.472
Here, then.

03:06.506 --> 03:08.340
You know all about hot air.

03:08.374 --> 03:10.175
You know what? I have another idea.

03:10.209 --> 03:12.511
You stay here and do
whatever it is you have to do

03:12.545 --> 03:14.913
and Ty can join us!

03:14.948 --> 03:17.682
It's about time he took part in
the Fleming-Bartlett traditions,

03:17.716 --> 03:19.216
don't you think, Jack?

03:19.250 --> 03:21.652
Took a little more
responsibility around here.

03:21.687 --> 03:24.221
Okay, I will talk to him.

03:24.255 --> 03:26.023
Ooh! They're here!

03:28.326 --> 03:31.128
- So? How was it?
- Great!

03:31.162 --> 03:32.729
- Hi!
- Hi!

03:32.763 --> 03:34.097
I'm glad you're back.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.499
- Hey!
- Hi!

03:35.533 --> 03:37.567
- I was snorkeling!
- You were snorkeling?!

03:37.602 --> 03:40.103
It was amazing!
A sea turtle swam up right next to me!

03:40.137 --> 03:41.571
No way! Weren't you scared?

03:41.606 --> 03:44.841
- No, it was awesome!
- It was great!

03:46.428 --> 03:47.998
- I'll take this and this.
- Thanks, Grandpa.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.029
- Hey.
- So?

03:50.146 --> 03:52.280
It was perfect.

03:52.315 --> 03:55.083
A few days to just be together as a family.

03:55.118 --> 03:56.485
We needed it.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.153
I can't believe it went by so fast.

03:58.187 --> 04:01.790
- Hey, welcome back!
- Thanks.

04:11.901 --> 04:13.401
Hi, Remy!

04:15.470 --> 04:18.072
I missed him so much.

04:18.106 --> 04:20.207
He's pretty much back to normal.

04:20.242 --> 04:21.608
He got lots of exercise
while you were gone,

04:21.644 --> 04:23.577
but I know he missed you too.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.980
Too bad I'm not gonna have much time
to spend with him over the weekend.

04:27.015 --> 04:29.950
I have to study all
afternoon tomorrow with Adam.

04:29.984 --> 04:31.952
Well, I have the morning off.

04:31.986 --> 04:34.521
We could go for a ride
first thing if you like?

04:34.556 --> 04:37.090
Really? Yeah. Sounds like a plan.

04:37.124 --> 04:38.892
Okay. You coming in for dinner?

04:38.927 --> 04:41.460
Yeah. I'll be there in a minute.

04:41.494 --> 04:42.995
Buddy...

04:48.835 --> 04:50.937
Hey! Muah!

04:53.707 --> 04:55.975
All right, I am almost a free man.

04:56.009 --> 04:57.642
I just have to finish up
at the clinic tonight,

04:57.677 --> 04:59.611
and then it's just you and me.

04:59.645 --> 05:03.081
Yeah. I'm actually gonna have
to talk to you about that.

05:03.115 --> 05:05.316
Okay. Come on. Go on, go. Hey!

05:05.350 --> 05:07.185
- Hey.
- She told you yet?

05:07.219 --> 05:09.187
- Dad!
- Oh.

05:11.991 --> 05:13.357
Told me what?

05:14.616 --> 05:17.044
S09E11
Making the Grade

05:17.329 --> 05:20.455
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

05:54.664 --> 05:56.732
Okay, well, I was kinda looking forward

05:56.766 --> 05:58.299
to our weekend together.

05:58.334 --> 06:01.069
Yeah, me too. But they need your help,

06:01.104 --> 06:03.171
and my dad really wants you to come.

06:03.205 --> 06:04.973
Oh, right.

06:05.008 --> 06:06.974
He'll never actually admit it, Ty,

06:07.009 --> 06:09.543
but he wants you there.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.478
I think he just needs a flunky.

06:11.513 --> 06:13.213
That's not true, okay?

06:13.248 --> 06:15.049
- No?
- Not totally.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.718
He wants to involve you
more in the family business.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.021
More like he wants to give me a hard time.

06:20.055 --> 06:21.444
- Hey...
- He's good at it.

06:21.497 --> 06:23.460
He gives everyone a hard time,
you know that.

06:23.555 --> 06:24.631
I know. I know.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.984
Please?

06:27.327 --> 06:30.263
Fine, I'll do it,
but I'm not doing it for your dad.

06:30.297 --> 06:33.733
Okay. I'll make it up to you.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.101
So Scott and I got the contract

06:35.136 --> 06:36.970
at the Hudson Corn Maze,

06:37.004 --> 06:39.772
so I was at the petting zoo
all day vaccinating animals.

06:39.806 --> 06:42.440
Jade and I have been meaning
to check the corn maze out.

06:42.475 --> 06:44.743
Well, you better do it soon
'cause the season's almost over.

06:44.778 --> 06:47.412
Maybe I'll call her after dinner.

06:47.446 --> 06:48.466
Maybe we can go tomorrow.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.157
Yeah, don't forget you
have a math tutoring session.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.919
I know. How could I forget?
I have a test Monday.

06:53.953 --> 06:55.854
Talk about ruining my vacation buzz.

06:55.889 --> 06:57.655
So, Mommy, is it okay?

06:57.690 --> 06:59.557
Lisa, are you sure about this sleepover?

06:59.591 --> 07:01.225
I mean, we just got back.

07:01.259 --> 07:03.728
Absolutely! I'm Looking forward to it.

07:03.762 --> 07:06.130
Okay. Well, I guess it'll give
me a chance to get caught up.

07:06.165 --> 07:07.531
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

07:07.566 --> 07:09.100
Well,
everything's running smoothly at Maggie's,

07:09.134 --> 07:10.668
and nobody's at the
Dude Ranch this weekend,

07:10.703 --> 07:13.437
so I think you should just relax
and ease back into it, Lou.

07:13.471 --> 07:16.506
Ty, I know you two had other plans.

07:16.540 --> 07:19.676
Are you okay to come on
this cattle drive with us?

07:19.711 --> 07:21.477
You bet. It's not a problem.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.914
Well, good.
It'll be good to have you along.

07:27.318 --> 07:29.619
Hey. Are you as jet lagged as I am?

07:29.653 --> 07:31.587
No, I slept on the plane.

07:31.621 --> 07:33.322
Smart. Is this dirty?

07:33.356 --> 07:35.958
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:35.992 --> 07:38.828
Jade and I are going to the
corn maze tomorrow night.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.629
Oh, I don't know, Georgie.

07:40.663 --> 07:44.600
Why? It closes at nine.
It's not gonna be that dark!

07:44.634 --> 07:47.136
We'll see.

07:56.837 --> 07:59.222
You can't keep
avoiding his calls forever.

08:00.879 --> 08:03.417
I know, but I just...
I don't know what to say.

08:03.452 --> 08:05.485
Well, I've told him that you're processing

08:05.519 --> 08:08.188
and he knows you're upset,

08:08.223 --> 08:10.357
but he really wants to talk to you.

08:10.391 --> 08:13.904
Does anyone else know about
"the girlfriend"?

08:14.562 --> 08:17.693
No. I haven't mentioned it to anyone.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.568
It's not really anyone's business.

08:28.242 --> 08:30.709
Step up. That a boy.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.445
Okay, okay, Dad!

08:33.480 --> 08:34.981
Can you just give him a break?!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.783
Ty was in the clinic late last night.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.917
Does that look like my problem?

08:44.023 --> 08:47.793
- Here's some coffee.
- Oh, look at that. Thank you.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.896
C'mon, let's go!
We're already behind schedule.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.000
I love you.

08:56.034 --> 08:57.835
Love you too. See ya.

08:58.921 --> 09:01.338
Looks like you'll need that more than me.

09:01.372 --> 09:04.198
Come on, come on!

09:04.676 --> 09:06.376
Have fun!

09:07.813 --> 09:09.880
Buckle up, boys!

09:17.208 --> 09:19.522
Should we bring Mr. Turtle?

09:19.556 --> 09:22.192
Now, you are gonna be there overnight.

09:22.226 --> 09:24.027
You understand, right?

09:24.061 --> 09:25.461
Are you sure you're okay with this?

09:25.495 --> 09:27.463
- Yup!
- Okay.

09:27.497 --> 09:29.265
- Hi!
- Hi!

09:30.666 --> 09:32.167
Hello, hello!

09:32.202 --> 09:34.336
- I'm ready!
- You're ready? Good thing!

09:34.370 --> 09:37.105
Now, I can pick her up anytime,
day or night,

09:37.140 --> 09:39.641
- if she gets scared, or...
- Oh no, don't worry.

09:39.675 --> 09:42.044
I mean, if that happens,
I'll bring her back myself.

09:42.078 --> 09:44.947
- And this is for you.
- What's this?

09:44.981 --> 09:46.348
Well, it's your first night off,

09:46.382 --> 09:48.549
so I want you to enjoy it and not worry.

09:48.583 --> 09:50.985
- Yeah, easier said than done.
- Well, you know what?

09:51.019 --> 09:52.386
The girls are gonna have more
and more plans as time goes by,

09:52.420 --> 09:53.955
so this is a good trial run for you!

09:53.989 --> 09:56.584
Bye, Sweetheart!

10:04.031 --> 10:06.432
You guys haven't left yet?
Adam's gonna be here soon.

10:06.467 --> 10:07.834
Yeah, we won't be long.

10:07.869 --> 10:09.769
Just getting tacked up now.
I have to get back too.

10:09.803 --> 10:14.040
I uh... I ordered a chair and
ottoman for Ty's birthday.

10:14.075 --> 10:15.708
It's being delivered this afternoon.

10:15.743 --> 10:17.110
Ty's birthday isn't for a while.

10:17.144 --> 10:18.578
Yeah, but I found a killer deal online

10:18.612 --> 10:20.180
so I figured I'd jump on it.

10:20.214 --> 10:21.780
Where are you gonna put it?

10:21.814 --> 10:24.750
Mm... You know, try a few different spots,
see what works.

10:24.784 --> 10:26.919
Amy, I'd love to help if you...

10:26.953 --> 10:28.587
Oh, that's okay.
I'd rather do it by myself.

10:28.621 --> 10:30.356
Make the space our own, you know?

10:30.390 --> 10:32.424
Thanks for the offer though.

10:35.195 --> 10:37.296
I was worried about him on vacation.

10:37.330 --> 10:40.031
From the photos, it looks like you
didn't have a care in the world.

10:40.065 --> 10:43.334
- Katie and I had a blast.
- Not Lou?

10:43.369 --> 10:46.326
Um... her too, I guess.

10:47.239 --> 10:49.274
I shouldn't say anything. She says...

10:49.308 --> 10:51.042
it's not really anyone's business.

10:51.076 --> 10:53.311
What isn't?

10:53.345 --> 10:54.978
Can you promise not to say anything

10:55.013 --> 10:57.281
- if I tell you something?
- Yes. You know that.

10:57.315 --> 10:59.316
You know what? No, I... I shouldn't say.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.684
Georgie, now you have to tell me.

11:01.719 --> 11:05.088
Okay, fine.
When we were in Vancouver at Dad's condo,

11:05.123 --> 11:07.291
we met his new girlfriend.

11:08.692 --> 11:11.961
Are you kidding me? A girlfriend?

11:12.679 --> 11:13.896
That must have been awkward.

11:13.931 --> 11:16.132
Yeah, big time.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.134
Lou's pretending it's not happening,

11:18.168 --> 11:19.902
but I can tell it's driving her crazy.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.305
Oh.

11:24.841 --> 11:28.102
- Adam's on his way. I should go.
- Yeah.

11:30.746 --> 11:32.213
Hmm.

11:41.557 --> 11:44.826
Next time, I'm driving. That was brutal.

11:46.677 --> 11:48.323
Ooh.

11:57.538 --> 12:00.207
Wakey, wakey! Beauty rest is over!

12:02.243 --> 12:04.777
Ugh. Is there any coffee left?

12:07.581 --> 12:09.648
No! Snooze, you lose.

12:09.683 --> 12:11.851
So what's the plan?

12:11.885 --> 12:13.652
The plan is to head
up into the high country

12:13.687 --> 12:16.122
and bring the cows down,
and we'll camp here for the night.

12:16.156 --> 12:17.790
We'll do the final push tomorrow.

12:19.193 --> 12:22.327
But first, you have to unload the horses.

12:23.796 --> 12:26.431
Well, what're you gonna do?

12:26.466 --> 12:29.401
The trail boss supervises.

12:29.435 --> 12:31.803
I'll be supervising.

12:33.772 --> 12:36.375
All right, let's do this!

12:40.879 --> 12:42.713
Uh, thanks. There you go.

12:44.182 --> 12:47.251
- So where's it going?
- Um, hi.

12:47.285 --> 12:49.120
Sorry, if you could take it into the barn,

12:49.154 --> 12:51.222
just on the second floor,
that would be great.

12:52.624 --> 12:55.392
Lou, um, I know I said I...
I didn't need your help,

12:55.426 --> 12:58.395
but decorating is really more
your kind of thing and...

12:58.429 --> 13:00.430
if you're free...?

13:00.464 --> 13:03.466
- Amy, of course, I'm free!
- Okay. See you in a bit?

13:03.501 --> 13:05.468
- Sure.
- Thanks.

13:12.128 --> 13:15.010
What's taking so long? How'd I do?

13:20.917 --> 13:22.651
You obviously retained some of the material

13:22.685 --> 13:24.486
we were working on before you went away.

13:24.521 --> 13:27.156
You solved eight out of
ten problems correctly.

13:27.190 --> 13:30.958
- Seriously? That's awesome!
- It's okay.

13:30.992 --> 13:33.627
What's up with you? You've been
in a bad mood since you got here.

13:33.662 --> 13:35.763
I'm not paid to be in a good mood.

13:35.797 --> 13:38.566
I'm paid to tutor you...
and obviously it's working.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.302
Maybe I should refocus some
of that energy on my own work.

13:42.704 --> 13:44.405
Look, if you don't wanna do this,
then quit.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.274
- It's fine by me.
- No, it's not that.

13:47.308 --> 13:49.242
I bombed a test.

13:49.277 --> 13:52.412
Wait, you? You bombed a test.

13:52.447 --> 13:54.114
How bad was it?

13:54.148 --> 13:57.150
Oh, you know.
Just the worst grade of my academic career.

13:57.185 --> 13:58.751
B plus.

13:58.786 --> 14:00.387
I would kill for a grade like that.

14:00.421 --> 14:02.754
Yeah, well, we're different.

14:02.789 --> 14:04.256
It's cool that you're all focused

14:04.291 --> 14:07.126
on getting good marks and stuff, but...

14:07.160 --> 14:08.994
you need to get over yourself.

14:09.028 --> 14:11.530
You take things way too seriously.

14:11.565 --> 14:14.833
Thanks for the pep talk,
I feel so much better now.

14:14.867 --> 14:18.137
You need to just... do something fun.

14:18.171 --> 14:19.704
Like what?

14:19.738 --> 14:21.439
Like check out the Hudson Corn Maze

14:21.474 --> 14:23.059
Jade and I are going to tonight.

14:23.133 --> 14:25.410
It's lame. I could find my way out
of that stupid maze no problem.

14:25.444 --> 14:27.178
Doubt that.

14:29.248 --> 14:30.648
Prove it.

14:32.084 --> 14:33.818
Ha!

14:33.852 --> 14:35.286
Come on now! Get up!

14:35.321 --> 14:37.654
Ha!

14:37.688 --> 14:40.424
Ha! Let's go!

14:40.458 --> 14:44.495
Come on!

14:44.529 --> 14:46.663
- Get up, cows.
- Hey!

14:46.697 --> 14:50.000
Hold up, hold up, hold up, guys. Whoa.

14:50.034 --> 14:53.569
Does that little steer look
a little lame to you, Ty?

14:53.604 --> 14:56.506
Uh... I don't think so.
It looks fine to me.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.407
Jack, what do you think?

14:58.442 --> 15:01.677
Yeah.
I think it's worth taking a closer look.

15:01.711 --> 15:04.380
Yeah, I-I think so too.

15:21.096 --> 15:24.499
Okay, come on, come on! Get in there.

15:28.370 --> 15:30.271
Hey! Wait!

15:30.305 --> 15:34.408
Get him down!

15:41.983 --> 15:43.917
I don't think there's
anything wrong with him.

15:58.199 --> 15:59.999
So what time is Jade supposed to here?

16:00.033 --> 16:02.234
Uh, soon. You don't have to stay.

16:02.268 --> 16:06.371
- Look, they have maps!
- We won't need it.

16:06.406 --> 16:09.040
Don't stay out too late, okay?
And stay in touch.

16:09.075 --> 16:10.576
I'll just be in the loft with Amy, if...

16:10.610 --> 16:12.844
Yeah. You said it like three times.

16:12.878 --> 16:15.080
Okay. And Adam, do you have a ride home?

16:15.114 --> 16:17.882
Yeah, his dad's gonna take
him and Jade will drive me.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.750
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

16:19.784 --> 16:21.118
You don't have to worry.

16:21.152 --> 16:24.988
Okay. Well... have fun.

16:28.827 --> 16:30.561
Adam?

16:37.444 --> 16:38.468
Nah.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.451
Whoa!

16:59.485 --> 17:02.254
Come on, come on, cows! Come on!

17:02.288 --> 17:03.921
That's right. That's right!

17:06.191 --> 17:07.590
Let's go!

17:07.625 --> 17:08.960
Come on!

17:08.993 --> 17:10.627
Yep! Come on, cow!

17:10.662 --> 17:12.730
- Outside! Ty!
- Yup.

17:12.763 --> 17:14.498
Whoa.

17:14.531 --> 17:15.900
Yup, yup.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.839
Whoa! Whoa! Easy, easy.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.708
- Hold on!
- Easy! Whoa! Easy, easy.

17:25.742 --> 17:27.710
Easy now.
Easy now.

17:27.744 --> 17:30.680
Easy! Easy! Easy!

17:30.714 --> 17:32.815
I don't wanna hear it!

17:37.421 --> 17:38.854
I wasn't gonna say that at all.

17:38.889 --> 17:41.023
That horse is doing great!

17:41.057 --> 17:45.227
- I told you he'd be fine.
- Fine? Are you kidding me?

17:48.698 --> 17:50.099
What's that supposed to mean?

17:50.133 --> 17:51.633
Well, I mean he's fast. He moves well.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.402
Look at him.

17:53.436 --> 17:55.003
That's a lot of horse for an old fella.

17:55.037 --> 17:57.005
Maybe too much, right?

17:57.039 --> 17:58.406
Just saying.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.508
Come on!

18:07.049 --> 18:09.117
Wow, Amy, it's beautiful.

18:09.151 --> 18:10.584
Ty's always wanted a leather chair.

18:10.619 --> 18:12.552
Well, I think he's gonna love it.

18:12.586 --> 18:13.954
I stopped at Maggie's on my way home.

18:13.988 --> 18:17.224
Got us some chicken, and...
Lisa gave me this.

18:17.258 --> 18:18.625
That was nice of her.

18:18.659 --> 18:21.561
So? What did you have in mind?

18:21.595 --> 18:24.264
Well, I was thinking of maybe... over here,

18:24.299 --> 18:27.100
with like a side table and a lamp.

18:27.135 --> 18:29.101
Mm-hmm. Okay.

18:29.136 --> 18:30.937
Well, let's have some fun with it,

18:30.971 --> 18:32.471
because wherever you decide to put it,

18:32.505 --> 18:34.540
I have a feeling it will never be moved.

18:34.574 --> 18:36.142
What is that supposed to mean?

18:36.176 --> 18:39.011
Come on, Amy. You're like Grandpa.
You hate change.

18:39.046 --> 18:40.980
Excuse me! That's not true!

18:41.014 --> 18:44.350
What do you call all this?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.117
Mazes date back four thousand years

18:46.152 --> 18:47.518
to the time of Greek myths.

18:47.553 --> 18:48.954
They were found in artwork, floor designs,

18:48.988 --> 18:50.455
pavement in streets.

18:50.489 --> 18:53.391
Jade's not coming.
She has to help her mom with something.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.137
I'll call Lou to give us a ride.

18:56.348 --> 18:59.664
- My dad can drive you home.
- Oh, okay.

18:59.698 --> 19:02.500
So? It's time to prove
you can get us outta here.

19:06.071 --> 19:07.938
Want some?

19:07.973 --> 19:09.440
Nah. If a husk gets stuck
in between your teeth,

19:09.474 --> 19:11.842
it can irritate the gum tissue,

19:11.876 --> 19:13.577
which can attract bacteria
that can lead to tooth decay.

19:20.053 --> 19:22.551
- Well, that isn't bad.
- Hmm.

19:22.586 --> 19:25.788
- What do you think?
- Hang on. I'm just texting Georgie.

19:26.548 --> 19:29.758
Um... honestly? I think we can do better.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.463
- Let's try it over here.
- Okay.

19:33.497 --> 19:35.865
- This is fun.
- Yeah.

19:35.899 --> 19:38.200
Just the two of us hanging out.

19:38.234 --> 19:41.103
We don't do it enough.

19:41.137 --> 19:43.105
All right.

19:43.139 --> 19:46.174
You know, I still can't even
believe this is the same place.

19:46.209 --> 19:49.644
What's crazier is that I'm
living here as a married woman.

19:49.678 --> 19:51.980
It still kind of blows my mind.

19:52.015 --> 19:54.548
I get that.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around

19:54.582 --> 19:57.184
all the changes in my life.

19:57.219 --> 20:00.654
I mean, I've been married and separated,

20:00.688 --> 20:03.424
and now I'm a single mother
with two daughters...

20:03.458 --> 20:06.127
who are both getting lives of their own.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.229
Yeah, well, Georgie is a teenager.

20:08.263 --> 20:10.664
I know, but even Katie is
off on her first sleepover.

20:10.698 --> 20:12.732
Okay, I think it's hardly time

20:12.766 --> 20:14.967
for you to be worrying about an empty nest.

20:15.002 --> 20:16.369
I know, I just...

20:16.404 --> 20:20.073
I kinda feel like everyone
is moving on without me.

20:22.276 --> 20:24.877
It sounds like maybe it's
time for you to move on too.

20:24.912 --> 20:26.513
What do you mean "sounds like"?

20:26.547 --> 20:30.049
Well, you never did tell me what
it was like for you to be...

20:30.083 --> 20:31.850
In Vancouver?

20:31.884 --> 20:35.954
Yeah. I mean with... what happened.

20:35.988 --> 20:39.324
Did Georgie say something
to you about the...?

20:39.359 --> 20:42.161
About the girlfriend?

20:43.629 --> 20:46.830
Yeah, and I promised I
wouldn't say anything to you,

20:46.865 --> 20:50.134
but, Lou, she's worried about you.

20:50.169 --> 20:52.736
And so am I.

20:52.771 --> 20:56.574
Maybe...
maybe it is time for you to move on.

20:56.608 --> 20:58.776
Peter obviously has.

20:58.810 --> 21:00.144
You know, keeping it under wraps

21:00.179 --> 21:03.480
and pretending nothing's
going on isn't the answer.

21:03.514 --> 21:06.149
Have you...
have you talked to him about it?

21:06.184 --> 21:08.785
Of course I have, Amy!

21:08.819 --> 21:11.188
How do you think I felt...

21:11.222 --> 21:13.356
How do you think Georgie felt when this...

21:13.391 --> 21:15.959
woman just walks into his apartment?

21:15.993 --> 21:17.461
But that isn't even the worst of it.

21:17.495 --> 21:19.462
When I heard her name was "Sylvia,"

21:19.496 --> 21:22.298
I realized that the girlfriend has
been in the picture for a while now!

21:22.332 --> 21:23.222
What do you mean?

21:23.264 --> 21:25.850
"Sylvia" was supposed to watch the girls...
my girls

21:25.881 --> 21:27.536
this summer in Vancouver!

21:27.571 --> 21:29.871
- Peter offered that up months ago.
- No...

21:29.906 --> 21:32.241
It makes me sick just to think about it.

21:32.275 --> 21:34.376
I can't believe that Peter
would actually do that.

21:34.411 --> 21:36.011
You can't believe it?

21:39.248 --> 21:43.881
Lou, I am sorry. This really sucks.

21:45.279 --> 21:48.956
But you still have a full life
ahead of you. You're young...

21:48.991 --> 21:51.459
I'm not as young as "Sylvia".

21:51.494 --> 21:54.328
You know, she's a younger,
prettier, more stylish me!

21:54.362 --> 21:56.430
She's Lou two point oh.

21:58.133 --> 22:00.942
You know, it's not like I wanna
get back together with Peter,

22:01.087 --> 22:03.103
because I don't.

22:03.138 --> 22:05.472
It's just hard being replaced...

22:07.074 --> 22:11.043
especially so fast.

22:15.516 --> 22:18.851
Go to the left.

22:18.885 --> 22:21.387
Another dead-end.

22:21.421 --> 22:23.523
I guess we weren't paying attention.

22:23.557 --> 22:25.057
We just need to backtrack.

22:25.091 --> 22:27.592
Or maybe we should've grabbed
one of those maps, ya think?

22:29.895 --> 22:31.296
Is that your mom again?

22:31.330 --> 22:34.976
Yeah, she can be kind of
a control freak sometimes.

22:35.868 --> 22:39.171
I guess we'll find our way
out of here eventually.

22:39.205 --> 22:40.705
Wandering through a maze without a plan

22:40.739 --> 22:43.141
is called the "random mouse" method.

22:43.176 --> 22:45.509
It's inefficient, with no guarantee
that we'll find their exit.

22:45.544 --> 22:47.110
I'll get us out of here using the
"pledge algorithm."

22:47.145 --> 22:49.380
- What's that?
- You keep your hand on the wall

22:49.414 --> 22:51.448
and move in one direction
until you hit another wall.

22:51.483 --> 22:54.385
Then follow it.
Count the number of turns you take,

22:54.419 --> 22:56.220
add one for the rights,
subtract one for the lefts.

22:56.254 --> 22:59.523
- When your turn count is zero...
- That's never gonna work!

22:59.558 --> 23:01.624
You don't get it? Big surprise.

23:01.659 --> 23:03.526
Just follow me.

23:23.145 --> 23:24.746
Well, not a bad day's work.

23:24.780 --> 23:28.116
Yeah, don't get ahead of yourself.
It's not over yet.

23:28.150 --> 23:30.252
You gotta untack these horses and tie
'em up.

23:30.286 --> 23:32.354
Problem?

23:33.756 --> 23:35.889
No. No, no, no. No problem.
You're the boss.

23:35.924 --> 23:38.326
Yes, I am.

23:38.360 --> 23:41.028
So when you're done, you can set up camp.

23:41.062 --> 23:43.063
'Kay?

23:45.234 --> 23:47.101
Thanks, Ty.

23:55.378 --> 23:56.856
What?

23:56.910 --> 24:01.147
He's gotta earn his stripes, just like...

24:01.181 --> 24:02.819
you're no fun anymore.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.887
Mm-hmm. Okay. I love you too, sweetheart.

24:07.921 --> 24:10.962
Yeah. Good night! Sleep tight!

24:12.624 --> 24:15.869
Sounds like Katie's
having the time of her life.

24:16.829 --> 24:19.197
You know,
this worked out great that Ty was away

24:19.232 --> 24:21.567
just when this stuff arrived.

24:21.601 --> 24:23.802
Yeah. You know, I...

24:23.836 --> 24:25.738
I wasn't quite sure how
I was gonna surprise him,

24:25.772 --> 24:29.240
but then the drive got
moved up and it worked out.

24:29.275 --> 24:31.376
Dad wanted to include him in a tradition.

24:31.410 --> 24:34.078
I think that he's finally
accepting Ty into the fold.

24:34.112 --> 24:35.813
Hmm... Yeah.

24:35.847 --> 24:38.249
That never happened with Peter and Dad.

24:38.284 --> 24:40.618
They were just always at each other.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.853
Don't let anything like that
ever come between you and Ty,

24:42.888 --> 24:45.922
because Peter and I bickered
about it at the end.

24:45.956 --> 24:47.658
I think it was more than bickering.

24:47.692 --> 24:50.427
It was more like all-out war.

24:50.461 --> 24:52.729
You know,
marriages go through rough patches, Amy.

24:52.764 --> 24:55.732
It's to be expected.
What you call all-out war,

24:55.767 --> 24:58.168
I call open, honest communication.

24:58.202 --> 24:59.469
Remember that.

24:59.504 --> 25:01.537
Yeah, well, Ty and I have that, okay,

25:01.571 --> 25:03.673
but we actually listen to each other...

25:03.707 --> 25:05.974
Are you insinuating
that Peter and I didn't?

25:06.009 --> 25:08.177
It's so easy for you to say.

25:08.211 --> 25:10.346
You and Ty have been married
for all of five minutes.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.915
I mean, Amy,
you're still in the honeymoon phase.

25:12.949 --> 25:14.617
It gets harder, trust me.

25:14.651 --> 25:16.585
Okay, are you really one to
be giving out marriage advice

25:16.620 --> 25:19.020
considering the circumstances?

25:21.924 --> 25:23.692
I'm sorry.

25:23.726 --> 25:27.228
No. You're right.

25:27.262 --> 25:31.098
I am at the end of a failed relationship.

25:31.133 --> 25:32.500
But on the other hand,

25:32.535 --> 25:33.968
that might just make me the perfect person

25:34.002 --> 25:36.169
to be doling out the advice.

25:40.007 --> 25:42.476
This doesn't make any sense.
I did everything right.

25:42.510 --> 25:44.978
It should've worked.

25:46.918 --> 25:49.721
Well,
do you think maybe we should call your dad,

25:49.813 --> 25:51.218
tell him we're gonna be a little late.

25:51.252 --> 25:53.353
No way!
It's bad enough that I look like an idiot

25:53.387 --> 25:54.721
for getting lost in the first place.

25:54.755 --> 25:57.089
I'm already in his bad
books because of the B-plus.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.258
Sounds like he's kinda strict.

25:59.292 --> 26:02.061
Nah. He's-He's pretty great, actually.

26:02.095 --> 26:03.796
He just has high expectations.

26:03.831 --> 26:05.865
He's Hudson's new Chief of Police.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.800
He doesn't ask for much.
Just for me to be the best.

26:07.835 --> 26:09.234
That's all.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.236
If my parents expected me to be perfect...

26:11.270 --> 26:12.971
They'd be pretty disappointed all the time.

26:13.005 --> 26:16.207
Wow. I thought I put my
foot in my mouth sometimes.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.011
My mom keeps telling me
to think before I speak,

26:20.045 --> 26:21.413
but that doesn't always work.

26:21.447 --> 26:23.314
Does it ever work?

26:25.284 --> 26:28.051
I've got stuff with my dad too.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.620
He's dating this new woman.

26:29.654 --> 26:31.589
I found out right before I went on vacation

26:31.623 --> 26:34.324
and I haven't talked to him since.

26:34.359 --> 26:35.926
That sucks.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.862
So I guess your parents
aren't getting back together.

26:37.896 --> 26:41.632
No. As much as I'd love that,
it'll never happen.

26:45.436 --> 26:47.404
You're hungry? Now?

26:47.438 --> 26:50.039
No, but I'm pretty sure we've
been down this path a few times.

26:50.073 --> 26:52.975
The popcorn will help us keep track.

26:53.010 --> 26:55.745
The entrance to the cornfield
is on the east side.

26:55.780 --> 26:59.615
We should keep heading in that
direction as much as possible.

26:59.649 --> 27:02.551
Seriously?
Your plan is to just Hansel and Gretel it?

27:02.585 --> 27:05.287
You got a better idea?

27:25.555 --> 27:26.988
My dad will be here in ten minutes.

27:27.023 --> 27:29.024
We'll never find our way out by then!

27:31.027 --> 27:33.194
- Which way?
- Not sure.

27:34.931 --> 27:36.296
That way has popcorn down it!

27:36.330 --> 27:38.098
We've been down that path.

27:38.132 --> 27:39.867
Let's try this way.

27:39.901 --> 27:42.903
This is never gonna work.

27:45.941 --> 27:47.808
I found the exit!

27:58.052 --> 28:01.253
We did it! We did it!
We got out! Oh my God!

28:01.288 --> 28:04.256
Oh my God. Um...

28:04.291 --> 28:07.193
- Ah! That's my dad! Let's go.
- Yes! Let's do that.

28:08.862 --> 28:11.830
Okay, this should hold.

28:15.301 --> 28:16.802
Where's the, uh, other tent?

28:18.237 --> 28:20.072
What other tent?

28:20.106 --> 28:21.940
You mean we're all sleeping in there?

28:21.975 --> 28:23.609
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize the doctor

28:23.643 --> 28:26.877
expected his own quarters.

28:26.912 --> 28:29.246
I don't, Tim. It's just gonna
be a little... cramped in there

28:29.280 --> 28:31.181
with us three, but...

28:31.216 --> 28:33.150
No, no, no... I... I get it.

28:33.184 --> 28:35.252
If you're uncomfortable with it,
I'll just...

28:35.286 --> 28:37.054
sleep out here by the fire.

28:37.089 --> 28:39.556
Suit yourself.

28:39.591 --> 28:41.492
Tim, you don't have to sleep out here.
We can...

28:48.930 --> 28:50.579
Okay.

28:51.135 --> 28:52.936
Good night.

29:04.681 --> 29:06.615
Tim? What're you up to?

29:06.650 --> 29:08.250
I just remembered...

29:08.284 --> 29:10.418
I have got a single
mattress in the trailer...

29:10.453 --> 29:13.288
that should not go to waste.

29:13.322 --> 29:15.490
Sleep tight, fellas.

29:15.525 --> 29:17.659
Seriously?!

29:17.693 --> 29:19.994
- This feels right, don't you think?
- Yeah.

29:20.029 --> 29:21.396
Hello!

29:21.462 --> 29:22.913
- Hi!
- Hey.

29:22.998 --> 29:26.779
- Hey!
- Hey! You're back!

29:29.337 --> 29:31.906
How did it go?

29:31.940 --> 29:33.340
Is everything okay?

29:33.375 --> 29:35.909
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I think I'm just tired.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.711
- There's tons of leftovers.
- Yes.

29:37.745 --> 29:39.445
Uh, no, I'm... I'm good.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.648
I think I'm just gonna
head in and go to bed.

29:41.683 --> 29:43.083
I'll... I'm gonna come with you.

29:43.117 --> 29:44.818
No, no, no. It's okay. You can stay.

29:44.852 --> 29:46.219
Are you sure?

29:46.253 --> 29:48.588
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:48.622 --> 29:50.123
Good night!

29:50.158 --> 29:52.825
That was a little loud.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.897
You know,
she's been avoiding Peter's calls.

29:57.931 --> 30:00.332
And now she's shutting herself off from me!

30:00.366 --> 30:02.534
Could you feel that? I could...

30:04.171 --> 30:05.671
Everything would be different

30:05.706 --> 30:07.239
if that house hadn't burned down.

30:07.273 --> 30:09.373
What house?

30:09.408 --> 30:12.043
Are... are you talking about
the Hanley dream house?

30:12.078 --> 30:14.713
- Mm-hmm.
- Lou, come on now.

30:14.747 --> 30:16.280
That wasn't gonna fix everything!

30:16.315 --> 30:18.482
You can't actually believe that.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.085
You really have to face facts...

30:20.119 --> 30:22.253
Don't you think I'm trying, Amy?

30:22.287 --> 30:24.823
Don't you think...
that-that this is hard for me?

30:24.857 --> 30:28.592
I mean, can you imagine how
I felt when this strange,

30:28.626 --> 30:33.296
young... young woman let
herself into Peter's apartment

30:33.331 --> 30:35.332
with her own key?!

30:35.366 --> 30:37.500
She had her own key, Amy!

30:37.535 --> 30:40.037
Yeah, because she is his girlfriend.

30:40.071 --> 30:43.806
Thanks... for clarifying that.

30:43.841 --> 30:46.109
Okay, you know what? I...

30:46.143 --> 30:47.509
I think we're done for tonight.

30:47.544 --> 30:50.279
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:50.313 --> 30:52.181
We need to talk this out right now!

30:52.216 --> 30:53.850
And that is another good tip

30:53.884 --> 30:56.119
for maintaining a healthy marriage.

30:56.153 --> 30:57.519
Not that you're willing to admit

30:57.554 --> 31:00.856
that your perfect, adorable,
aren't-we-the-best-couple-ever,

31:00.890 --> 31:04.425
look-at-Amy-and-Ty marriage
is ever gonna need any help...

31:04.460 --> 31:06.862
Okay, Lou, that's enough.

31:06.896 --> 31:08.563
And it's a good thing
that we aren't married

31:08.597 --> 31:11.133
because this conversation is over!

31:26.081 --> 31:29.116
Morning, Buddy, how'd you sleep, hey?

31:43.864 --> 31:46.032
Where is that Longhorn?

31:54.040 --> 31:57.276
Oh, there you are, you slippery sucker.

31:58.744 --> 32:00.145
Yah.

32:04.951 --> 32:07.885
Come on, boy, let's get him.

32:14.559 --> 32:16.894
That a boy. We've got him now!

32:20.299 --> 32:22.266
Hey! Hey! Easy!

32:22.301 --> 32:26.303
Ugh!

32:39.000 --> 32:40.701
You look horrible.

32:40.735 --> 32:43.752
I know. I didn't sleep much.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.549
Really. I slept like a baby.

32:48.309 --> 32:50.810
Yeah, well, Jack snores, so.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.812
I know.

32:54.330 --> 32:57.338
Where is he anyways? Buddy's not here.

32:58.051 --> 33:01.811
Huh. Well, the longhorn's missing too.

33:01.903 --> 33:03.222
That Longhorn, he is jumpy.

33:03.256 --> 33:04.623
He doesn't like being penned in.

33:04.657 --> 33:07.159
I'll bet Jack's gone to round him up.

33:08.628 --> 33:11.864
Hey, you got a lame steer right there.

33:11.898 --> 33:14.233
For real this time.

33:14.267 --> 33:16.435
- That one?
- Yeah, over there.

33:16.469 --> 33:18.470
Huh. Well, let's take a closer look at him.

33:33.752 --> 33:37.154
Yeah.
Well, there's swelling up to the fetlock.

33:37.188 --> 33:38.788
And the dorsal pouch is infected.

33:38.823 --> 33:40.523
Foot rot.

33:42.493 --> 33:45.295
You think it's infected the herd?

33:45.330 --> 33:46.796
It's hard to say. I'll treat this guy,

33:46.831 --> 33:49.132
and I can check the rest of the them.

33:49.167 --> 33:51.768
Okay, do that.

33:56.740 --> 34:00.542
Hey. You were pretty quiet last night.

34:00.577 --> 34:02.345
Did you have fun?

34:02.379 --> 34:04.280
Well,
you already know the corn maze went okay,

34:04.314 --> 34:07.283
'cause I had to send a check-in
text every ten minutes.

34:07.317 --> 34:08.650
Yeah, sorry about that.

34:08.685 --> 34:10.253
I may have gone a little bit overboard.

34:10.286 --> 34:12.320
It's all right. All right, I should go.

34:12.355 --> 34:13.788
Hey, hang on one second.

34:13.822 --> 34:15.790
How're you feeling about the test today?

34:15.824 --> 34:18.092
Um... okay. I think a lot of this stuff

34:18.127 --> 34:19.560
is finally starting to make sense...

34:19.594 --> 34:20.962
That's great.

34:20.996 --> 34:23.130
I know you haven't exactly
loved working with Adam.

34:23.165 --> 34:24.732
Well, it-it's okay.

34:24.766 --> 34:26.434
Well, you remember,
before you started school,

34:26.467 --> 34:28.369
that I said if you kept your marks up

34:28.402 --> 34:30.204
we could revisit the issue?

34:30.237 --> 34:33.572
- Yeah. So?
- So, if you do well on your quiz today,

34:33.608 --> 34:37.034
you don't have to keep working with Adam.

34:37.812 --> 34:39.880
That is what you want, isn't it?

34:39.915 --> 34:42.248
Uh... yeah. Yeah, totally! That'd be great!

34:42.284 --> 34:43.750
Okay.

34:43.784 --> 34:47.520
- Mommy!
- Hey, sweetheart! Hi!

34:49.163 --> 34:50.469
All right, see you!

34:50.549 --> 34:51.815
- Okay, good luck!
- Thanks.

34:51.858 --> 34:53.359
I thought you were taking
her to kindergarten.

34:53.393 --> 34:54.744
Well, that was the plan,

34:54.783 --> 34:56.795
but then Katie said she wanted
her mom to take her to school.

34:56.830 --> 34:59.299
You did? What's this?

34:59.333 --> 35:00.934
It's me and you on the beach.

35:00.968 --> 35:04.502
- Oh, sweetheart, I love it!
- She worked all night on it.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.072
Come here. Mm...

35:32.197 --> 35:34.765
Hey, Buddy.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.924
That a boy.

36:19.574 --> 36:21.509
I'm sorry.

36:23.379 --> 36:24.678
Me too.

36:24.713 --> 36:26.580
I'm not sure I remember everything,

36:26.615 --> 36:30.384
but um... I know I got a little
out of hand last night, so.

36:30.418 --> 36:32.152
It wasn't just you.

36:32.186 --> 36:34.970
We both took things a little too far.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.158
I do really appreciate your help.

36:38.192 --> 36:41.194
Not just on decorating.

36:41.229 --> 36:44.096
Honestly, Amy, you shouldn't
be listening to anything I say.

36:44.131 --> 36:45.498
About relationship, especially.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.471
I'm sorry for how it came out last night,

36:52.506 --> 36:55.841
but I... I did mean it.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.809
You need to move on, Lou.

36:57.844 --> 37:00.346
And... I'm sure it's not gonna be easy,

37:00.380 --> 37:03.048
but nothing happens unless
you make it happen, right?

37:03.082 --> 37:05.950
So, what?
You think I should start dating again?

37:05.984 --> 37:08.028
Actually, yeah.

37:11.223 --> 37:13.758
How's the steer holding up?

37:13.792 --> 37:15.960
Well, it's not an advanced case.

37:15.994 --> 37:18.762
So the antibiotics should do the trick.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.834
How 'bout the rest of the herd?

37:24.869 --> 37:30.107
Well, I checked them all out
and they seem to be fine, so...

37:35.645 --> 37:37.313
Good catch.

37:40.217 --> 37:42.151
Thanks.

37:42.186 --> 37:44.520
The old man's been gone too long.

37:44.555 --> 37:47.022
And that hunk of junk cell phone of his.

37:48.892 --> 37:51.527
- What, no answer?
- No. No, I think we should tack up

37:51.562 --> 37:53.661
- and... and maybe we should...
- Okay.

37:53.696 --> 37:55.434
Jack!

37:57.066 --> 37:59.167
Hey. Hey.

37:59.202 --> 38:00.535
Hey, Ooh, hey man. Jack.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.036
- Hey, hey.
- Easy...

38:02.071 --> 38:04.806
Shoulder! Shoulder!

38:06.242 --> 38:08.376
Hey, hey. Hey, what happened?

38:08.411 --> 38:11.712
I'm all right. I... I just need a minute.

38:11.746 --> 38:13.180
Did this horse throw you?

38:13.215 --> 38:17.251
No... No, I just wasn't
paying close enough attention.

38:17.285 --> 38:19.487
Hey, Jack, I can help you with your cuts,

38:19.521 --> 38:21.422
but you're gonna have to
get checked out by a doctor.

38:21.456 --> 38:23.890
- I don't need to see a doctor.
- You're gonna see a doctor, Jack,

38:23.925 --> 38:25.326
and you're gonna see one now.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.495
Come on. Ty, stay with him.

38:33.066 --> 38:34.934
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey!

38:34.968 --> 38:38.037
- How did it go?
- Um... okay, I guess.

38:41.208 --> 38:42.908
They gave you back your marks already?

38:42.943 --> 38:46.411
Yeah. Mrs. Haggis made us
mark each others' exams.

38:51.984 --> 38:57.055
Georgie?! Congratulations!
Seventy-nine percent!

38:57.089 --> 39:00.591
- It's not too bad.
- It's really good!

39:00.626 --> 39:02.593
You know, you've worked hard

39:02.628 --> 39:04.395
and you don't have to
keep working with Adam,

39:04.429 --> 39:06.605
if that's what you're worried about.

39:12.304 --> 39:14.472
- Jack?
- Grandpa?

39:19.040 --> 39:21.217
I just wished someone had called us.

39:21.404 --> 39:23.339
I could've met you at Dr. Virani's.

39:23.373 --> 39:25.941
Now there's no need to get
all worked up about it.

39:25.975 --> 39:29.654
I knew I was fine. Tricia confirmed it.

39:29.733 --> 39:33.315
You know, the worst thing about all this...

39:33.350 --> 39:35.351
is I lost my favourite hat.

39:35.385 --> 39:37.485
Really? That's the worst thing?

39:37.520 --> 39:40.488
Hey,
it looks like he's on the mend.

39:40.523 --> 39:42.657
Come here.
There's something I wanna show you.

39:45.486 --> 39:47.940
Happy early birthday!

39:48.897 --> 39:51.273
Amy!

39:51.378 --> 39:53.542
This is awesome!

39:53.735 --> 39:56.136
I'm so glad you like it.

39:56.171 --> 39:57.838
I love it!

39:57.873 --> 40:01.022
Come here.

40:01.977 --> 40:03.110
It arrived yesterday.

40:03.163 --> 40:06.046
It was actually good timing that
you went on the cattle drive.

40:06.081 --> 40:08.682
Lou came and helped me set it up.

40:08.716 --> 40:12.847
So... how was it, really?

40:14.154 --> 40:17.690
Well, as I predicted,
your dad was a bit of a pain...

40:17.724 --> 40:19.791
Incoming!

40:20.767 --> 40:24.540
Hi. Wow! Nice chair.

40:25.565 --> 40:27.933
Planning on sitting there
'til the cows come home?

40:27.967 --> 40:30.635
'Cause they don't actually
come home by themselves.

40:30.669 --> 40:33.372
All hands on deck. Come on, let's go.

40:45.717 --> 40:47.651
Go!

40:49.988 --> 40:51.355
Get up! Come on!

40:53.025 --> 40:55.259
Get up!

40:56.895 --> 40:58.963
Come on!

40:58.997 --> 41:00.664
Come on! Let's go!

41:00.698 --> 41:02.198
Come on, get on!

41:02.233 --> 41:04.801
- Come on, cow! Come on.
- Come on!

41:04.835 --> 41:06.336
Up! More outside!

41:06.370 --> 41:08.538
Get up!

41:08.572 --> 41:09.940
- Hey, Amy?
- Yeah?

41:09.974 --> 41:11.341
There's something I gotta do.

41:11.375 --> 41:12.742
I'll meet up with you guys later, okay?

41:12.776 --> 41:14.110
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:14.145 --> 41:15.545
Come on, cow, go!

41:16.981 --> 41:18.347
Get up! Up, up!

41:18.381 --> 41:20.249
I need to tell you something.

41:20.283 --> 41:24.053
It's okay. I know that you told
Amy about Peter's girlfriend

41:24.087 --> 41:27.292
and... well,
you don't have to worry about me anymore.

41:28.269 --> 41:29.758
I can't be mad at Peter.

41:29.792 --> 41:31.260
I mean, of course he's moved on and...

41:31.294 --> 41:34.296
I need to do that too.

41:34.331 --> 41:36.197
Okay. Well...

41:36.231 --> 41:37.898
I'm glad you're okay with
the girlfriend thing,

41:37.933 --> 41:40.234
but that's not it.

41:40.269 --> 41:42.236
Oh. So what is it?

41:43.705 --> 41:46.040
I don't want stop tutoring with Adam.

41:46.075 --> 41:49.510
Oh! Uh, why?

41:49.544 --> 41:52.846
- I don't know why.
- Do you wanna talk about it?

41:52.880 --> 41:56.216
No! At least not right now.

41:56.250 --> 41:58.151
So... if you keep working with Adam,

41:58.186 --> 42:01.254
you'll still be able to focus on your work,
right?

42:01.289 --> 42:03.523
- Mom!
- I'm just saying...

42:03.557 --> 42:05.956
maybe you have feelings for him.

42:09.997 --> 42:12.731
Come on, cow!

42:14.501 --> 42:16.402
It's Dad.

42:21.999 --> 42:25.587
Hello? Hi.

42:26.812 --> 42:29.647
Well, Amy, I gotta admit...

42:29.681 --> 42:32.917
Ty, he nearly held his own out there.

42:32.951 --> 42:35.086
Seriously, Dad? Nearly?

42:35.121 --> 42:37.755
Well, he hasn't got a clue
how to wrestle a steer.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.825
He can't even whistle.

42:41.227 --> 42:44.628
But I'll tell ya,
I enjoyed having him along.

42:44.662 --> 42:46.230
Well, I think it's pretty lucky

42:46.264 --> 42:49.099
that he spotted that foot rot when he did,
before it spread.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.827
You know, that was more than luck.

42:52.685 --> 42:55.846
And you know, he... he spotted that steer.

42:56.228 --> 42:59.109
Thank goodness for that.

42:59.144 --> 43:02.943
Hey! What do you got? No way!

43:03.062 --> 43:04.747
- Yeah, I found it.
- You found it?

43:04.781 --> 43:07.316
Yeah!
It's a little worse for wear, but I got it.

43:07.351 --> 43:09.352
Grandpa's gonna be so excited.

43:10.388 --> 43:14.490
Hey, Dad, wasn't there, uh,
something you wanted to say to Ty?

43:14.525 --> 43:15.981
No.

43:16.496 --> 43:18.013
No.

43:21.830 --> 43:24.699
Ha!

43:34.695 --> 43:36.544
What does it take
to be a rodeo star?

43:36.546 --> 43:38.590
You didn't care that she was
a great bronc rider,

43:38.622 --> 43:41.182
you just want her to be one
of your cowgirl Barbie dolls.

43:41.239 --> 43:42.015
No!

43:42.017 --> 43:45.296
It was more important to me
to be respected by my peers.

43:45.412 --> 43:46.246
I've got it covered.

43:46.299 --> 43:49.054
