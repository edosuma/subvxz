00:05.797 --> 00:06.715

00:06.798 --> 00:10.927

-I'm a fugitive.

Year-to-date, Bitcoin has an 800% return.

Your insistence on taking
a large position was insanely prescient.

that getting richer bores you.

-I'm not bored. I'm anxious to leave.
-We have another appointment.

that a review

01:23.041 --> 01:25.543

Uh, well, there's your holdings
in Singapore and the BSE, but--

02:27.397 --> 02:29.983
