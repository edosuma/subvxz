People get up the next morning

09:00.452 --> 09:01.976

I mess up my words.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.719

14:57.766 --> 14:59.072
Ugh, forget it.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.074
- Okay, first of all,
that whole thing of her

15:01.117 --> 15:03.815
calling me out
on my name was intense.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.774
- But the funny thing is,
is I was looking at,

15:05.817 --> 15:08.168
like, things online
about all of us coming here,

15:08.211 --> 15:09.604
and they're like,

15:09.647 --> 15:11.519
"She's gonna start
calling Kenya Porsha."

15:16.176 --> 15:17.394
And I didn't know
what that meant.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.656
And then today she did.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.701
- I actually think Porsha

15:19.744 --> 15:20.702
should get the master.

15:20.745 --> 15:21.790
Porsha's not here!

15:21.833 --> 15:23.139
- I meant Kenya.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.532
- Why do you call Kenya Porsha?

15:24.575 --> 15:25.837
- I don't know, 'cause I don't
really know Kenya.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.056
I just know Porsha.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.493
I've never really watched
the show recently.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.148
- I think it was
an honest mistake.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.542
But I don't think
she should do it again.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.283
- So who do you guys get along
with on your show,

15:36.326 --> 15:38.372
and who you don't?

15:38.415 --> 15:42.028
- I pretty much get along with
everyone for the most part,

15:42.071 --> 15:44.160
but I'm the closest
to Kenya and Kandi.

15:44.204 --> 15:47.163
- And you?
- I get along with Cynthia,

15:47.207 --> 15:52.342
Kandi, Marlo, LaToya, Falynn.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.691
- Everyone but Porsha.
- Right.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.565
- I'm so excited just to be
on an island right now.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.610
- Turks and Caicos
is beautiful.

15:59.654 --> 16:02.004
- It's so--the water.
- The water is breathtaking.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.789
- You know, the fish
swim at your feet here.

16:04.833 --> 16:05.877
- I don't like that.

16:05.921 --> 16:06.922
- No, they're nice fish.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.097
They're cute little ones

16:08.141 --> 16:09.272
that would be in,
like, your fish tank.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.491
- I don't like no fish
touching me.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.972
- They're like little
Nemos fish.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.062
- Patrick, can you turn the air
just a little down?

16:16.105 --> 16:18.499
I wonder how big
this island is.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.935
- It's not that big.
I mean,

16:19.979 --> 16:21.371
I could--it's not that big.
It's small, actually.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.720
- Patrick?
- Patrick?

16:22.764 --> 16:24.679
Right?
It's a small island, right?

17:13.336 --> 17:14.424
- Welcome, welcome
to Triton Villa.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.817
- Is that Michael?
- Hi.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.340
- Thank you.
- Hi. How are you? I'm Teresa.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.255
- So nice to see you.
- Are you Michael?

17:19.299 --> 17:20.517

17:20.561 --> 17:21.823
So nice to meet you.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.129
So nice to meet you too.
Welcome to Triton.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.260
- Thank you so much.
- Michael.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.306
- So nice to meet you.
- Luann.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.090
Talking to Michael
on the phone is one thing,

17:28.134 --> 17:29.787
but actually
meeting him in person

17:29.831 --> 17:32.355
<i>is a whole nother experience,
because he's quite cute.</i>

17:32.399 --> 17:33.922
- He's kind of easy
on the eyes.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.446
You know, I kind of got
my eye out for my girl Kenya.

17:36.490 --> 17:39.275
- Hi, I'm Cynthia.
Mwah!

17:39.319 --> 17:40.581
- He's a cutie pie.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.757
I know that voice.
- How was your flight?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.367
- I mean, Michael seems
like a great guy.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.369
I'm also very scared
for this man.

17:46.413 --> 17:49.285
- My boobs look good?
That's all that matters.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.808
- Where's the nearest
ladies' room?

17:50.852 --> 17:54.812
Teresa, Kenya, Melissa,
Cynthia, Luann.

17:54.856 --> 17:57.902
- Okay, ladies' room.
She said to the left.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.079
- Oh, my God, Ramona's already
in the house.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.558
- No.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.690
- What is she doing?

18:02.733 --> 18:04.605
- She's trying
to get her room already.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.563
- Ramona wants
the master bedroom.

18:06.607 --> 18:07.869
- Of course she wants
the master bedroom.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.653
- We're living together.
She's my husband.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.264
- I already got me stuff in it.
Sorry.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.266
- She always does this.
- Where is Ramona?

18:13.309 --> 18:15.094
- She's probably getting
her room right now.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.269
- I'm peeing on my territory.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.140
- I should have one
of the nicest rooms.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.489
- Are you serious?

18:19.533 --> 18:21.187
- Okay, well,
we'll see about this.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.189
- I know the layout already.
Master bedroom, three-bedroom.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.017
- Welcome. Welcome to Triton.
- Crazy.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.497
- Wow. Wow.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.933
- Oh, my God!
- Wow. Wow.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.110
- Did you find Ramona?
- Up claiming a room.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.242
- These are the two best rooms.
Maybe this one.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.897
- Girls, can we take a tour
and at least see the house?

18:35.940 --> 18:37.986
- Upstairs.
- Can't claim a room.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.683
You can look and not claim.
How about that?

18:39.727 --> 18:45.080
- Yeah, we just look.
- Okay, this is it. Done.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.516
- Is this the master?
- Yes.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.736
- Yeah, this is the master.
- Oh, man.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.694
- This is amazing.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.827
- They all have
oceanfront views,

18:52.870 --> 18:55.264
except that one room
downstairs.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.049
- Oh, let's see
the other two rooms.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.703
- So they share the bath?

18:59.747 --> 19:02.010
So whoever's here
shares this bathroom.

19:02.053 --> 19:05.666
- Oh, so we put Ramona in here.
- Yeah, so let's just do that.

19:05.709 --> 19:06.971
- Do you think Ramona's
gonna come here?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.756
- Kyle is there.
- She's gonna kick and scream.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.759
- She doesn't have a choice. <i>
- I deserve the best room.</i>

19:13.108 --> 19:15.719
- Listen, as I said before,
I'm the most senior here.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.460
<i>And all my fans are saying,</i>

19:17.504 --> 19:18.635
<i>"You better get
the best room."</i>

19:18.679 --> 19:20.376
Well, maybe I should
get the best room.

19:20.420 --> 19:21.682
Maybe I should care.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.206
I mean, I gotta support
what my fans think.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.729
- Where's Kyle?

19:25.773 --> 19:27.209
- I'm fine with that room
down there.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.558
- Luann.

19:28.602 --> 19:29.951
- Kyle's out there living
her best life.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.214
- Ahh.
- What is she doing out there?

19:32.258 --> 19:33.563
- Kyle's over it.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.348
<i>- You ladies can fight
over these rooms</i>

19:35.391 --> 19:36.871
<i>as long as you want.</i>

19:36.914 --> 19:39.569
We don't play like that
in Beverly Hills.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.267
- Ramona.
- Ramona! Ramona!

19:41.310 --> 19:42.616
- Seniority.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.487
I picked one of the bedrooms,
not the bedroom.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.923
I'm taking this bedroom.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.403
- Get your ass out of the bed.
- No, no, no.

19:47.447 --> 19:48.970
- It doesn't--it doesn't
work like that.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.014
- Uh-uh.
- Sorry.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.233
- There's other women here.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.713
- Who died and made
you the boss?

19:52.756 --> 19:55.411
- 'Cause I'm the eldest.
The eldest rules.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.283
- I'm so used to being
embarrassed by Ramona

19:57.326 --> 19:58.893
that it kind of doesn't
faze me anymore.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.155
<i>So it's kind of nice
to see her</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:01.417
<i>getting called out finally.</i>

20:01.461 --> 20:02.940
Karma's a bitch, isn't it?

20:02.984 --> 20:04.725
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- This is my room.

20:04.768 --> 20:05.987
Porsha, you get
the other--you get the--

20:06.030 --> 20:07.510
- Her name is not Porsha.
- If you call me

20:07.554 --> 20:08.990
that one more time--
- Her name is Kenya.

20:09.033 --> 20:09.947
- Kenya.
- Oh, my God.

20:13.255 --> 20:16.215
- Oh, that was a big faux pas.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.520
- Diana.
- Are you talking to me?

20:17.564 --> 20:18.956
- Michelle.
- I meant Diana.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.523
- No, I'm Michelle.
- No, you didn't. Michelle.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.785
- The fact that Tinsley
stopped seeing Brian--

20:21.829 --> 20:23.004
- Brian?

20:23.047 --> 20:24.005
- Who's Brian?
- Bruce.

20:24.048 --> 20:24.962
- Oh.
- Oh, Bruce.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.616
- She calls KeKe KeKa.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.924
- Hello, boatman, how are you?
I refer to you as the boatman.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.752
Maybe I know that down deep,
and that's why I said it.

20:31.795 --> 20:35.016
Who knows? I don't know.
I don't think so, though.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.931
- You're being ridiculous.
- Come on.

20:36.974 --> 20:40.282
- Ramona, I'm gonna need you to
act properly, darling. Come on.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.501
- She's not being
a team player.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.589
- You're putting
your dirty feet

20:42.632 --> 20:45.069
inside somebody's sheets
already.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.072
Get out of the bed.
You're not special. Come on.

20:48.116 --> 20:49.465
- Yeah, I am.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.818
- I have a feeling Ramona's
my roommate in the bunk room.

20:54.862 --> 20:58.474
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
I know I'm Jewish, but still.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.651
- Get out.
I'm gonna take a shower.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.697
Can they bring me luggage
up here with the gold thing?

21:03.740 --> 21:06.308
- I just want to have lunch.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.831
Guys, I can't be fighting
for a room.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.050
It's beneath me.

21:11.095 --> 21:12.401
- Is this six?

21:12.445 --> 21:13.489
- Let's just do that.
- So that's me and you.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.490
- I'm not gonna fight
with people.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.404
- Okay.
- I don't care.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.840
- All right.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.059
- We have beautiful
homes in LA.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.713
- All right.
This will be our suite.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.671
Me and Kyle, we're gonna
share this as a big suite.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.891
- What she's not getting
is she cannot do all the things

21:23.934 --> 21:26.807
that she's done and then feel
like she gets the best room.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.070
- Ramona.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.071
Ramona.

21:32.073 --> 21:34.380
- Pardon?

21:34.423 --> 21:36.425
- Ramona?
- She's in the shower.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.471
- Ramona. Can we talk to you
for a minute?

21:38.514 --> 21:40.734
- She's naked.
She's in the shower.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.475
- I haven't known this lady
a day,

21:42.518 --> 21:45.086
and now I've already
seen her naked.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.959
- Give her some privacy.
Really? Like...

21:49.003 --> 21:50.396
Oh, my God.

21:50.439 --> 21:53.486
We just got here, and we got
seven more days to go.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.096
- Kyle and Melissa
are taking downstairs.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.708
- I like the last one
on the end.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.319
So you have a tub, Luann.
- I do?

22:00.362 --> 22:01.711
- You're good with that?
'Cause I just have a shower.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.061
- Michael! Which one's my room?

22:04.105 --> 22:05.802
- Will be the third one
down from the master.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.021
- Is this the one
that she was in?

22:07.064 --> 22:08.544
- This is where Ramona is,
I think.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.416
Or that's the one
she laid claim to.

22:10.459 --> 22:14.811
- Oh. Oh, my God, she's naked.
Oh, my God. I went in there.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.639
Me and Michael--
Michael saw her naked.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.249
She don't give a
She's like--

22:18.293 --> 22:20.121
- She's trying to hit
on Michael, that's why.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.253
- Michael, did you
like what you saw?

22:22.297 --> 22:23.777
- Huh? What?

22:23.820 --> 22:25.996
- You didn't sign up
for a senior citizen, did you?

22:26.040 --> 22:27.389
- I didn't see too much.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.999
- Michael can stay with me.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.349
- I didn't see too much.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.133
- There's an old saying,
you know, when you show

22:32.176 --> 22:35.049
your ass--we've
literally seen Ramona's ass.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.530

22:44.841 --> 22:46.321

22:46.365 --> 22:47.844

22:47.888 --> 22:49.890

can think about ♪</i>

22:49.933 --> 22:52.109
- We're sharing this
bathroom, Kyle.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.937
<i>- ♪ You can flex
and think you found me ♪</i>

22:53.981 --> 22:55.896
- Oh, my God, it's so hot.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.115
- I kind of feel like I'm with
college girls,

22:58.159 --> 23:01.945
and we're dorming, and this
is my dorm or something.

23:01.989 --> 23:05.253
- This had a lock on the side,
I remember. Hey, Sean.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.690
So listen, thank you for
putting a lock on my luggage,

23:07.734 --> 23:09.562
even though, you know,
it did have a lock.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.652
Cute. How do I open it?
You never sent me the code.

23:12.695 --> 23:15.306
9-2-8.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.749
- Hi.

23:25.229 --> 23:28.058
- She's sleeping? Okay.
Call me when she wakes up. Bye.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.062
- I would love a margarita
on the rocks.

23:32.106 --> 23:33.542
- On the rocks.
- Light salt.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.457
- I'll do the same, no salt.
- Heavy on the tequila.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.504
- Yeah, I need one after that.
- Oh, my gosh!

23:38.547 --> 23:39.461
- Yeah.
- What pisses me off

23:39.505 --> 23:41.115
is, I literally, like,

23:41.158 --> 23:44.335
the whole ride here,
took up for Ramona.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.555
It's only been two and a half,
three hours with her.

23:46.599 --> 23:47.600
- We haven't even
gotten there yet.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.297
- I'm going to...

23:49.340 --> 23:50.254
- I've been called a bitch.
I've been cursed at.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.778
- Reset the button...
- Ahh!

23:51.821 --> 23:53.780
- And give Ramona
another chance.

23:53.823 --> 23:55.259
- Thank you. Right.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.131
- So it's unacceptable
for--what she's doing.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.524
- Oh, we need some ground
rules, or it's gonna suck,

23:58.567 --> 24:00.656
because the worst is to be
in a group of women

24:00.700 --> 24:03.006
and nobody wants
to hang out with you.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.139
She's literally gonna be
on an island by herself,

24:05.182 --> 24:05.966
no pun intended.

24:09.317 --> 24:13.234
The whole, like, you know,
seniority thing, I'm like,

24:13.277 --> 24:15.845
I've been on this show
for 11 years.

24:15.889 --> 24:17.499
And I'm probably--
- I started my show.

24:17.543 --> 24:20.284
I need my phone, sweetheart.
Who's more popular?

24:20.328 --> 24:22.983
- You or Ramona?
- Based on Instagram.

24:23.026 --> 24:27.814
Ramona has 869,000.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.772
Let's see how many I have.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.166
2.2 million.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.298
- If you are the oldest,
you are the grownest,

24:34.342 --> 24:36.387
you need to act
like you got the most sense.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.389
- Right. How old is she?

24:38.433 --> 24:40.174
- I have to Google it.
I didn't bring my phone.

24:40.217 --> 24:43.351
- Is she closer to 65, I heard?
- 65? I don't know.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.918
- So if that's the case, like,
I don't know,

24:44.961 --> 24:46.354
does that whole dementia thing
start happening?

24:46.397 --> 24:49.531
- Oh, Lord.
- Yeah. I don't know.

24:49.575 --> 24:53.013
- So I'm taking a poll.
We're on a TV show.

24:53.056 --> 24:55.885
I am the longest-running
original OG.

24:55.929 --> 24:57.626
You know, I've been filming
since 2006.

24:57.670 --> 25:01.500
But Kenya, she's going through
some really difficult times,

25:01.543 --> 25:02.892
so I said, you know what?

25:02.936 --> 25:04.938
Give her the best room,
and I'll take another.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.896
Explain what I did wrong,
'cause I'm not getting it.

25:06.940 --> 25:11.553
- You come with a very
direct approach.

25:11.597 --> 25:12.598
- Well, isn't that good?

25:12.641 --> 25:14.034
Shouldn't we be
all direct here?

25:14.077 --> 25:15.165
- No, no, I think that's
what makes you so wonderful.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.427
- And you just met me. Wow.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.865
- And, like, I understand.
And I think--

25:18.908 --> 25:21.476
- And I think--I think--
- Oh, that's your son?

25:21.520 --> 25:22.738
- Yeah, this is my mother.

25:22.782 --> 25:25.567
- Aww. All in the family.
I love it.

25:25.611 --> 25:29.397
- Oh, my God, she's naked.
Her butt is hanging out.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.964
Why do I have to see
her ass crack

25:31.007 --> 25:33.357
when I'm eating right now?
She's an exhibitionist.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.055
- Is that panties?
- I think it's a thong.

25:35.098 --> 25:38.145
- Wow, this is nice.
Is that her asshole?

25:38.188 --> 25:39.581
- Come here. Sit here.
Yeah.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.061
- Oh.
- Are you naked?

25:41.104 --> 25:42.323
- No! I have a coverup on.
- What's underneath?

25:42.366 --> 25:43.672
- Is that your underwear?
- Yeah.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.065
- Her underwear
and nipple covers.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.980
- I don't see a nipple cover.
I see nipples.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.242
- No, I have nipple covers.

25:48.285 --> 25:49.852
- No, she has
some nipple covers.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.201
- Hey, girls.
- Look at you. Wow.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.986
- I was gonna go for a swim.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.291
- I'm looking--I'll go in
with you. I'll go in.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.989
- What?
- I'll go with you, baby.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.077
- Wow, these New Yorkers.
- I was gonna put on my--

25:57.120 --> 25:58.469
- They don't see beaches often.

25:58.513 --> 25:59.862
- I know.
I want to go swimming so bad.

25:59.906 --> 26:00.733
- They get right into
their nakedness.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.343
- Me too.

26:02.386 --> 26:03.300
- I think I'm gonna go
for a swim and then sit down.

26:03.344 --> 26:04.475
- Okay.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.955
- Well, that's why
you look like that.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.131
- My luggage, they put
a lock on it for security.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.742
they gave me the code,
but the code doesn't work.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.091
I can't open it.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.614
- That's not right that she--

26:12.658 --> 26:14.268
- Right?
- I never start a fight.

26:14.311 --> 26:17.227
Like, I always finish it.
I know--I never start it.

26:17.271 --> 26:19.099
Like--and she threw
the first punch

26:19.142 --> 26:20.491
by saying the Scarecrow
thing--something

26:20.535 --> 26:22.319
about me not having a brain
or something?

26:22.363 --> 26:24.104
- Which, we didn't even know
about the Scarecrow thing.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.541
- She doesn't care.
Clearly, she doesn't care.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.195
- Yeah, she don't want
to--I don't think

26:28.238 --> 26:30.632
she wants to make friends.
I think she don't even care.

26:30.676 --> 26:35.768
- Probably warmer
than the pool.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.074
I can't! I got nothing on!

26:38.118 --> 26:41.121
I don't know if this
is washable or dry cleanable.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.340
It could shrink
in the saltwater!

26:43.384 --> 26:45.473
- Hi.
- Oh, you didn't change?

26:45.516 --> 26:46.866
- No. I was...

26:46.909 --> 26:48.476
You okay?
- Me? Yeah, I'm good.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.565
- Are my eyes black or no?
- No, you look gorgeous.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.088
- Yeah?
- You look like Sophia Loren.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.482
- Aww. Thank you, baby.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.179
- But I don't look like
I'm naked-naked, right?

26:56.223 --> 26:59.095
I just look sexy naked--like,
sexy something, right?

26:59.139 --> 27:01.010
- Oh, wow,
that orzo looks amazing.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.491
- Do you call this "conch"
or "conk"?

27:03.534 --> 27:04.753
- "Conk."

27:04.797 --> 27:06.450
- "Conk"--like, "conk," right?
Not "conch."

27:06.494 --> 27:08.496
- What are we wearing tonight?
I mean,

27:08.539 --> 27:11.020
can we--is it bare feet,
or in the sand, or we can--

27:11.064 --> 27:12.587
- Look at how beautiful.
- Oh, I don't know.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.936
- This place is beautiful.
It really is.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.242
- I heard it was, like, sand.
- Michael?

27:15.285 --> 27:17.200
Can you describe
what tonight looks like?

27:17.244 --> 27:20.290
- Yeah. Da Conch Shack
is--it's on the beach.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.727
- Okay.
- Yeah. So--

27:21.770 --> 27:23.337
- So we should wear,
like, flats.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.947
- Definitely wear flats.
- Okay.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.820
- Uh-oh.
- What?

27:27.863 --> 27:28.908
- Uh-oh.
- I don't have many of those.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.693
- All right,
I'm gonna get ready.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.913
- This is, like, interesting.

27:33.956 --> 27:36.872
I always wondered how it would
be with all of us together.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.179
- Right?
- And it's almost like

27:39.222 --> 27:41.181
the way they act
on their own shows

27:41.224 --> 27:42.617
is kind of--is what you get.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.488
It's the same, like,
from whatever you watch.

27:44.532 --> 27:45.968
- Well, if they're
being themselves, then yes.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.361
- Then that's that.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.667
Here, let's--I want
to show Joe.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.190
Maybe I'll FaceTime Joe.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.932
- Let's FaceTime Joe.
- Let's say hi to Joe.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.977
- I haven't seen Joe since
we did a double date in Vegas.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.544
- I know.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.720
Well, we saw you in
Beverly Hills that night too.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.243
At Mr. Chow.

28:00.287 --> 28:06.597
- Right.
- Hi. Kyle wants to say hi.

28:06.641 --> 28:09.513
<i>- What's up, girl?
- How are you?</i>

28:09.557 --> 28:12.429
<i>- Hi. How are you?
- Good. Nice to see you.</i>

28:12.473 --> 28:14.562
<i>- Yes. Yes. I miss you.
Where's your--where's</i>

28:14.605 --> 28:16.477
<i>your husband,
your good-looking husband?</i>

28:16.520 --> 28:18.697
- He's in LA
holding down the fort.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.133
<i>- How's it going, Mel?</i>

28:20.176 --> 28:22.788
- Ramona's on the beach
right now in a thong

28:22.831 --> 28:24.703
with just nipple covers on.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.313
<i>- No.
- I swear.</i>

28:29.011 --> 28:30.883
- She's normal.
I was gonna say--

28:30.926 --> 28:32.232
- They say I'm the normal one.

28:32.275 --> 28:36.062
- I'll stick with my girl
over here.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.367
- What we saw today
was not normal.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.717
- The normal ones
stay together.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.719
Although we have
a little--we're a little off.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.111
But...

28:42.155 --> 28:44.984
- A little off.
No one's totally normal here.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.563
- Hey, Cynthia, it's Michael.
- Hi.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.261
- Hey. Just to let you know,
the taxis are ready,

29:01.304 --> 29:02.871
and we're ready to take you out
to Da Conch Shack.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.133
- Okay. All right.
I'll be down in two seconds.

29:04.177 --> 29:07.223
- Okay.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.791
- Okay, let's call John.

29:09.835 --> 29:13.752
Johnny, Johnny, it's Ramona.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.666
<i>- Hey.
- Hey. Are you like me?</i>

29:15.710 --> 29:17.668
Are you just, like,
out of the shower?

29:17.712 --> 29:19.061
<i>- I just stepped
out of the shower,</i>

29:19.105 --> 29:20.802
<i>and I just gotta get over
to Da Conch Shack.</i>

29:20.846 --> 29:23.326
-
Well, I got out of the shower,

29:23.370 --> 29:26.025
and I just had my hair done.
What do you think?

29:26.068 --> 29:27.591
<i>- Looks wonderful.
- Aww.</i>

29:27.635 --> 29:29.942
The last time I physically
saw John was years ago.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.117
Hi.
- I'm John.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.683
- Wow, you're, like--
you work out.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.903
<i>So tonight I feel like
making a bit of an entrance.</i>

29:34.947 --> 29:37.471
<i>Like, I want to just kind of
look really good for John.</i>

29:37.514 --> 29:40.300
It'll be interesting to see
if any sparks will fly or not.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.215
The girls are ready.
We're gonna be there,

29:42.258 --> 29:43.782
I think, earlier than later.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.132
I think we're gonna get there
probably, like, 6:30.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.611
<i>- Oh. Okay. Well, I gotta run,</i>

29:47.655 --> 29:49.309
<i>'cause I'm not dressed
or anything.</i>

29:49.352 --> 29:51.006
- Well, you could
just go naked, baby.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.096
<i>- Okay.
I'll see you there shortly.</i>

29:54.140 --> 29:58.797
- Okay. Bye. So funny.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.712
Very cute.
He looks kind of cute.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.370
- ♪ La-la-la-la, la-la

30:10.634 --> 30:12.375
I have no spot for my shoes.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.900
- Where are you?
- Here.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.553
- I think I'm gonna do
my own makeup the whole time.

30:16.597 --> 30:17.903
- Me too.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.556
Your necklace
is on backwards, by the way.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.906
- Melissa?
- Yeah.

30:20.949 --> 30:25.301
- No, it's not.
- In the mirror it's not.

30:25.345 --> 30:29.653
- Oh,
- I was like, is that English?

30:29.697 --> 30:31.917
So it goes this way.
Yeah, you put it backwards...

30:31.960 --> 30:33.135

- Are you seeing that somebody
is literally writing

30:41.883 --> 30:43.842
on Twitter every move.
- What we've been doing?

30:43.885 --> 30:47.846
- Verbatim. Somebody's talking.
I don't know who.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.412
I mean, it's not me.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.761

30:55.592 --> 30:58.813
"The Housewives have arrived at
the house in Turks and Caicos.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.729

31:01.772 --> 31:03.644

31:08.562 --> 31:11.217
That is word-for-word.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.348
Come on.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.916
- Well, someone's talking.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.352
So who is it?

31:16.396 --> 31:18.137
- Like, who is the guy
saying it?

31:18.180 --> 31:19.660
- Well, here's a picture
of this guy.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.836

31:34.762 --> 31:35.981

31:37.286 --> 31:38.984

follows, and he follows her

31:42.639 --> 31:44.728

31:44.772 --> 31:46.774

31:46.817 --> 31:48.167

Four in this one,

Just sit here.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.380
so is that being an asshole?

38:15.423 --> 38:18.557
- No, Ramona, but you
disregarded everyone else!

38:18.600 --> 38:20.385
- That's the real issue.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.343
- I think I don't like everyone
to come at you at one time.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.779
- Yeah, I don't--

38:23.823 --> 38:24.867
- I'm happy to have
a side conversation with you.

38:24.911 --> 38:25.781
- Let's have
a side conversation.

38:25.825 --> 38:26.739
- All right, come on.

38:26.782 --> 38:27.957
- I respect that,

38:28.001 --> 38:29.350
and I will listen to you.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.352
- Cynthia's always
the peacemaker in our group,

38:31.396 --> 38:33.006
but I just think
she's wasting her time.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.660
<i>Ramona can't see herself.</i>

38:34.703 --> 38:36.226
I don't know
if there's any peace

38:36.270 --> 38:37.532
to really be made with her.

38:37.576 --> 38:40.405
- Ramona does not know
how to read a room.

38:40.448 --> 38:44.583
She need somebody to say,
"Friend, you up."

38:44.626 --> 38:47.150
- Some of us know each other.
Some of us don't.

38:47.194 --> 38:48.717
I've told every person
over there

38:48.761 --> 38:50.937
that you've always
been nice to me.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.417
- And I feel the same way
about you.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.548
- Without question.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.550
But once we got here,
you just went

38:55.594 --> 38:58.161
into this whole other thing
that was, like,

38:58.205 --> 39:02.296
not really necessarily trying
to get to know everybody.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.951
And I understand, like,
you and Kenya went at it.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.605
You know, I do think that,

39:06.648 --> 39:08.171
you know, the way you handled
the situation

39:08.215 --> 39:11.218
on the plane--you know,
calling her a bitch

39:11.261 --> 39:13.394
and whatever,
that didn't have to happen.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.091
- You know, I call my
girlfriends a bitch, you bitch.

39:15.135 --> 39:16.310
- I know.
But you don't--you guys

39:16.354 --> 39:17.703
don't have
that relationship yet.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.269
- Right. No, you're right.

39:19.313 --> 39:20.619
- You know,
this is a group situation.

39:20.662 --> 39:23.186
But today you just weren't
being a team player.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.885
- In my mind, I don't think
I did anything wrong.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.321
But now hearing you,

39:27.365 --> 39:28.931
I did something wrong,
so I'm taking it in.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.455
- Well, but you came
in the house,

39:30.498 --> 39:32.152
got in the bed of the room
that you chose.

39:32.195 --> 39:35.024
- Well, I was trying
to be funny.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.331
- I'm just saying,
we kind of came together

39:37.375 --> 39:39.725
to actually try to get to know
each other and bond together.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.161
- I'm not disagreeing.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.423
- You know, we all have
these things out there

39:42.467 --> 39:44.164
that people think
about our personalities,

39:44.207 --> 39:45.818
about who we are.
- Yeah, sure.

39:45.861 --> 39:48.342
- But I think it's unfair to go
on a girls' trip together

39:48.386 --> 39:49.909
and not just kind of
give people

39:49.952 --> 39:51.954
the benefit of the doubt.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.695
- Do you think Ramona's upset
right now?

39:53.739 --> 39:54.957
- She doesn't care.

39:55.001 --> 39:56.437
- I would be mortified
right now.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.221
- I don't know
what's happening!

39:59.571 --> 40:01.094
- So how can I rectify?
What should I do?

40:01.137 --> 40:02.574
- All right, this is how
you can rectify it.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.619
You can go back and say,
"Hey, you know what, guys?

40:04.663 --> 40:07.143
"I had the best of intentions,
but maybe I didn't handle today

40:07.187 --> 40:08.841
the way I could have."

40:08.884 --> 40:11.496
- Yeah, I always--I always have
the worst delivery. Seriously.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.411
- I will be your wingman,
to help you out.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.195
- I have the worst delivery.
- If I feel like you're going--

40:15.238 --> 40:16.370
- No, I have
the worst delivery.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.372
- Okay.
- I admit, I'm tough.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.417
I grew up tough.

40:19.460 --> 40:20.679
I had to be tough
in my marriage.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.420
<i>I have to be tough in life.
I'm self-made.</i>

40:22.463 --> 40:25.379
And sometimes I just go--
you know, I steamroll.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.294
It's not that I want
to be mean or aggressive.

40:27.337 --> 40:28.382
<i>It's just the way it happens.</i>

40:28.426 --> 40:29.818
- So you're gonna go
over there,

40:29.862 --> 40:30.819
and what are you gonna say?
- I'm gonna say--okay.

40:30.863 --> 40:32.342
Here, let's role-play.

40:32.386 --> 40:35.258
Ladies, I now realize
I started off on the wrong foot

40:35.302 --> 40:37.478
and I created
a little animosity.

40:37.522 --> 40:38.479
So I want to make it up
to you all,

40:38.523 --> 40:39.915
and can we start
fresh tomorrow?

40:39.959 --> 40:40.960
- "Please allow me
the opportunity to..."

40:41.003 --> 40:42.222
- Please allow me to do that.

40:42.265 --> 40:43.310
Okay. Good?
- That's good.

40:43.353 --> 40:44.964
Humble.
- Thank you.

40:45.007 --> 40:48.707
- One thing about
Cynthia Bailey-Hill is,

40:48.750 --> 40:50.578
everybody gets a chance.

40:50.622 --> 40:53.015
<i>So I'm still trying
to see the good in Ramona.</i>

40:53.059 --> 40:54.713
<i>I'm trying to understand
this woman.</i>

40:54.756 --> 40:56.366
'Cause I'm confused.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.064
Ramona would like
to say something

40:58.107 --> 41:00.980
to everyone that's here.
- All right, Cynthia.

41:01.023 --> 41:03.156
What'd you--
what'd you do, Cynthia?

41:04.549 --> 41:06.376
- No, seriously.
No, I'm being really serious.

41:06.420 --> 41:07.595
- All right, we're gonna
take you seriously.

41:07.639 --> 41:09.467
- I really started off
on the wrong foot

41:09.510 --> 41:12.948
when we got to the house,
and I made the energy bad.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.384
We're all together
to have a good time.

41:14.428 --> 41:15.516
- Yes.
- And there was no intention

41:15.560 --> 41:16.691
to be, like, this person

41:16.735 --> 41:18.432
that you aren't
feeling receptive to.

41:18.476 --> 41:21.348
And please forgive me,
and I want to start fresh.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.916

41:23.959 --> 41:25.526
I did the wrong thing.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.310
- I'm so glad that Cynthia's
getting in there.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.138
But, you know,
I'm not holding my breath

Okay, yes, I have said things
that are terrible to people,

42:17.447 --> 42:21.190
but it was always justified
after I got to know them.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.801
Case closed.

42:22.844 --> 42:25.412
- I appreciate your apology.
- Thank you. Thank you, Kyle.

42:25.455 --> 42:27.370
- You said it,

42:27.414 --> 42:29.285

42:29.329 --> 42:30.809
We were, like--I was, like,
talking about

every girl on the trip.
- Yeah.

42:32.158 --> 42:34.508
- And I really love
smart women.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.510
I only surround myself
with smart women.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.859
- Get closer.
She can't hear you.

42:37.903 --> 42:40.253
- And I wasn't really sure
how bright you were.

42:40.296 --> 42:41.602
You even said--
- Kenya can't hear.

42:41.646 --> 42:43.386
- I'm talking to you.
It's about you and I.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.736
- Oh, okay. Oh, okay, okay.
- It's not about her.

42:44.779 --> 42:46.302
- Now, but they all heard
this comment now.

42:46.346 --> 42:47.390
- I just have to clear
the air with you.

42:47.434 --> 42:48.478
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay?

42:48.522 --> 42:49.523
I wanted this conversation
with you.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.611
- Okay.
- I don't really care

42:50.655 --> 42:51.917
about them;
it's about you and I.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.571
- But you said it to Kyle.
- I will tell you--

42:53.614 --> 42:55.355
- All right. So go on.
All right. Finish.

42:55.398 --> 42:56.661
- I just don't
sugarcoat things.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.880
And when you're doing
an apology,

42:58.924 --> 43:00.578
sometimes you have to do it
a little softer.

43:00.621 --> 43:02.188
- "I'm sorry.
That's just the way it is.

43:02.231 --> 43:04.103
I don't care. I don't care."

43:04.146 --> 43:06.496
- Told ya.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.368
- On your show, they say

43:08.411 --> 43:09.935
all these things,
like you're not smart.

43:09.978 --> 43:12.241
And I heard all these,
like, little noises.

43:12.285 --> 43:13.634
- Yeah.
- Then, when I was on the plane

43:13.678 --> 43:16.202
with you,
I realized, holy moly,

43:16.245 --> 43:18.160
you have your stuff
so together.

43:18.204 --> 43:19.945
You are unbelievable.

43:19.988 --> 43:21.903
You have overcome so much.

43:21.947 --> 43:26.734
And on that plane ride here,
I learned about who Teresa is.

43:26.778 --> 43:29.389
- I'm a four-time "New York
Times" bestselling author.

43:29.432 --> 43:30.564
I don't have to prove
to you anything.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.957
- And I admire you
tremendously.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.698
- Okay, I'm glad. I'm glad.
Thank you.

43:33.741 --> 43:38.354
- And Teresa is a strong woman,
caring, and smart.

43:38.398 --> 43:39.747
- Thank you.
- Okay, you are.

43:39.791 --> 43:41.183

- Okay, I changed my opinion.

<i>I'm a "New York Times"

46:55.813 --> 46:58.206
I was in a movie
when I was about 11 years old,

46:58.250 --> 47:01.775
<i>and I went to school,
and a bunch of kids said,</i>

47:01.819 --> 47:04.996
"Oh, we saw you in the movie,
and you looked fat."

47:05.039 --> 47:08.521
But all I could say was,
"I know."

47:08.564 --> 47:10.262
- You're curvy.
I like it better.

47:10.305 --> 47:11.654
- I also have, like, stuff.

47:11.698 --> 47:14.179
Like, I have, like,
you know, meat on me.

47:14.222 --> 47:15.441
- Oh, you gotta just stop.

47:15.484 --> 47:17.051
I'm really getting
upset with you.

47:18.966 --> 47:20.838
You guys--remember,
I see you guys on Instagram.

47:20.881 --> 47:22.840
You guys are wearing your
bathing suit. I don't do that.

47:22.883 --> 47:24.145
- Well, you can, because
your body's beautiful.

47:24.189 --> 47:25.755
- I have maybe
one good shot, and I get,

47:25.799 --> 47:28.062
like--okay, that's it,
one good shot for the year.

47:28.106 --> 47:32.284
- You have a great body.
I'm being serious. You do.

47:32.327 --> 47:34.025
Thank God your husband
doesn't feel that way.

47:34.068 --> 47:35.809
I'd feel bad
if you feel that way.

47:35.853 --> 47:36.766
- He's like, "If you--
I don't want you

47:36.810 --> 47:37.985
"wearing any cover-ups.

47:38.029 --> 47:39.595
You look amazing.
No cover-ups."

47:39.639 --> 47:42.076
- So sorry you feel this way
about your body.

47:42.120 --> 47:43.251
It makes me sad.

47:43.295 --> 47:44.905
- This is the side of Ramona

47:44.949 --> 47:47.081
that I was hoping
really existed.

47:47.125 --> 47:49.997
<i>I mean, Ramona,
I've met at certain things,</i>

47:50.041 --> 47:52.913
and I figured, you know,
she's going to offend someone.

47:52.957 --> 47:55.133
That's just a given.
But everything she's saying

47:55.176 --> 47:59.615
<i>to me tonight feels
like a very good girlfriend.</i>

47:59.659 --> 48:02.270
I'm happy to know
that she has this in her,

48:02.314 --> 48:07.188
because the other side
of Ramona is a little scary.

48:07.232 --> 48:09.887
- So maybe
being with us--this is maybe

48:09.930 --> 48:11.627
something you could work on.

48:11.671 --> 48:12.541
'Cause now you're with women...

48:12.585 --> 48:13.891
- Yeah.

48:13.934 --> 48:15.327
- Women who care about you
and like you.

48:15.370 --> 48:18.417
And maybe you can work
on your body image with us

48:18.460 --> 48:20.985
and slowly show
more of your body

48:21.028 --> 48:23.248
as you're comfortable
over the next seven days.

48:23.291 --> 48:24.597
- Okay.
- Try.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.511
- I'm gonna try.
- I'll right, good night.

48:25.554 --> 48:27.208
- I'm gonna try.

48:27.252 --> 48:28.818
<i>Good night.</i>

48:28.862 --> 48:31.169
<i>- ♪ You can drip me down
in Gucci ♪</i>

48:31.212 --> 48:34.433
<i>♪ Or you can drip me down
in Prada ♪</i>

48:34.476 --> 48:37.131
- Well, I want to thank John
for allowing us to do this.

48:37.175 --> 48:38.350
Thank you, John.
- Oh, my pleasure.

48:38.393 --> 48:39.525
Thank you for coming.

48:39.568 --> 48:40.787
I've spent some time
with you guys,

48:40.830 --> 48:42.702
and I was expecting
a little more drama.

48:42.745 --> 48:44.965
And you guys all seem
to like each other.

48:45.009 --> 48:46.314
- You should have seen
what happened

48:46.358 --> 48:47.968
on the yacht the other day.

48:48.012 --> 48:49.883
- What happened on the yacht
the other day?

48:49.927 --> 48:52.320
- Oh, it was nuts.
- We both want to hear.

48:52.364 --> 48:53.931
- Do we have to repeat stories?
- Yeah!

48:53.974 --> 48:55.193
- We're all on such
a good page right now.

48:55.236 --> 48:56.716
- Oh, my God,
we were--we just had a--

48:56.759 --> 48:58.283
we had a crazy, crazy day.

48:58.326 --> 49:00.198
- Do we have to really talk
about it right now? Really?

49:00.241 --> 49:04.680
- They were talking about how
Ramona tried to blackmail...

49:04.724 --> 49:06.465
- Actually, no, it's not true,
and you're wrong.

49:06.508 --> 49:07.727
- Luann.

49:07.770 --> 49:08.902
- I would never
blackmail anyone,

49:08.946 --> 49:10.208
so why are you
making up lies, Kenya?

49:10.251 --> 49:11.165
- And then, what else--
what else happened?

49:11.209 --> 49:12.645
- Oh, my gosh.

49:12.688 --> 49:16.388
<i>♪</i>

49:16.431 --> 49:17.606
- Wow.
