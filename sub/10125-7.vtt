SAYING GOOD DAY AND, UH...

10:02.867 --> 10:04.367
DON'T EAT VEAL.

10:04.367 --> 10:07.367
AND WE'RE...CLEAR.

10:07.367 --> 10:08.467
HAH...

10:08.467 --> 10:09.834
HUH, MR. WILLIAMS,

10:09.834 --> 10:11.300
JUST WHAT YOU WANTED...

10:11.300 --> 10:12.867
NEWS THAT GRABS.

10:12.867 --> 10:13.934
VERY EFFECTIVE REPORT.

10:13.934 --> 10:17.300
IT WAS TOUGH
UNTIL WE FOUND OUR ANGLE.

10:17.300 --> 10:18.800
SURE DID SOME DIGGING.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.200
MOM, DAD,
HOW PROUD ARE YOU?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.033
YOUR SON,
THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.233
UH, ALAN...

10:26.233 --> 10:29.100
UH, WELL, COR,
WAS...THIS ALL TRUE?

10:29.100 --> 10:34.100
WELL, YOU SAW IT,
"NOT A DRAMATIZATION,
NOT A DRAMATIZATION."

10:34.100 --> 10:36.200
WELL, THAT'S
VERY UNFORTUNATE.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
WHY IS THAT?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.000
BECAUSE I HAVE
THE TASK

10:39.000 --> 10:41.867
OF FIRING
JANITOR BUD.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.500
MAUREEN, HI.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
I DON'T GET IT.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.100
WE NAIL
A CLASS PROJECT,

10:59.100 --> 11:02.700
AND PEOPLE
ACT WEIRD ON US.
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

11:02.700 --> 11:05.200
NOBODY WANTS
JANITOR BUD FIRED.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.800
OH,
HE WON'T GET FIRED.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.400
HE'S BEEN
IN FEENY'S OFFICE
FOR AN HOUR.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.700
SAY WHAT YOU WANT
ABOUT FEENY--

11:11.700 --> 11:13.667
I THINK
HE'S THE BIGGEST--

11:13.667 --> 11:14.700
NOT NOW.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.200
I'M TELLING YOU,
FEENY'S FAIR.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.233
HE'LL GIVE JANITOR BUD
A SECOND CHANCE.

11:19.233 --> 11:22.200
WHAT? NO SECOND CHANCE?

11:22.200 --> 11:23.500
I WISH I COULD.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.767
OH, C'MON,
THERE'S HISTORY
BETWEEN US, GEORGIE.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.300
YOU AND ME,
WE'RE LIKE BROTHERS.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.100
NO, WE'RE NOT.

11:31.100 --> 11:34.300
BUD, YOU WERE
CAUGHT ON TAPE.

11:34.300 --> 11:37.000
BUT IN TWO MONTHS
I RETIRE.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.567
FULL PENSION.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.100
I'M SORRY.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.233
O.K. I DIDN'T
WANT TO USE THIS, FEENY.

11:43.233 --> 11:46.467
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THAT TIME
I SAVED YOUR LIFE?

11:46.467 --> 11:47.467
SAVED MY LIFE?

11:47.467 --> 11:49.000
YOU WALKED
DOWN THE HALL

11:49.000 --> 11:52.900
WHEN I NOTICED A PATCH
OF WAXY BUILD-UP.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.867
YOU WERE
BUT STEPS AWAY.

11:54.867 --> 11:55.867
NO TIME TO CLEAN.

11:55.867 --> 11:59.300
I HAD TO THROW MYSELF
ON THE WAX.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.867
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE NAPPING.

12:02.867 --> 12:07.233
WELL,
ONCE I WAS DOWN THERE...

12:08.400 --> 12:11.600
BUD, I WANT
TO THANK YOU

12:11.600 --> 12:12.934
FOR YOUR
DEVOTED SERVICE.

12:12.934 --> 12:17.700
AW, C'MON, GEORGE.
AMMONIA'S IN MY BLOOD.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.600
NO, REALLY, IT IS.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.400
OH, BUD,
DON'T DO THIS
TO YOURSELF.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.200
BUT IT'S ALL I KNOW.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.900
GODSPEED, BUD.

12:40.700 --> 12:43.500
BUD WAS FIRED
BECAUSE OF US.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.600
NO, SHAWN,

12:44.600 --> 12:45.967
WE SHOULDN'T FEEL BAD.

12:45.967 --> 12:47.000
WE TOLD THE TRUTH.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.300
BUD SHOULD FEEL BAD.
HE WAS GOOFING OFF.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.300
GOOFING OFF, HUH?

12:51.300 --> 12:53.300
YOU TELLING ME
LEAVING EARLY

12:53.300 --> 12:55.767
FOR NO REASON
IS GOOFING OFF?

12:55.767 --> 12:59.133
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
GET THE WHOLE STORY,
MISTER.

12:59.133 --> 13:02.300
DID YOU BOTHER
TO FIND OUT

13:02.300 --> 13:04.233
WHERE BUD WENT
AT 2:55?

13:04.233 --> 13:05.600
NO.
UH-OH.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.400
BEFORE
YOU PONTIFICATE
FROM YOUR TUCCUS,

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
LET ME
SET YOU STRAIGHT.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.600
EVERYDAY,
THAT SWEET BUDMAN

13:12.600 --> 13:13.900
TAKES A FEW DOLLARS

13:13.900 --> 13:18.100
AND VISITS A PLACE
WITH OTHERS
LESS FORTUNATE THAN HIM.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.600
MY STOMACH IS BUBBLING.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.900
GOOD. YOUR STOMACH
SHOULD BUBBLE.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.500
BECAUSE THAT MAN
YOU GOT CANNED,

13:24.500 --> 13:25.500
HE'S A GIVER.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.400
YOU KNOW WHERE
HE GIVES?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.100
I DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.033
THE TRACK,
MATTHEWS!

13:31.033 --> 13:33.367
PLAYING
THE PONIES.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.300
GAMBLING WAS ALL
HE HAD LEFT.

13:37.300 --> 13:41.500
NEXT TIME YOU STICK
YOUR NOSE WHERE
IT DON'T BELONG,

13:41.500 --> 13:42.734
REMEMBER THIS...

13:42.734 --> 13:44.700
YOU SUCK.

13:49.834 --> 13:50.934
WOW.

13:50.934 --> 13:51.934
POOR BUD.

13:51.934 --> 13:53.133
POOR BUD?

13:53.133 --> 13:56.834
"SAINT" BUD SKIPS WORK
SO HE CAN BLESS
THE PONIES.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.567
NOW HE'S GOT
NO INCOME.

13:58.567 --> 14:00.600
WHAT WILL HE
GAMBLE WITH?

14:00.600 --> 14:01.667
HE'LL BE O.K.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.667
HE'S A CAPABLE,
TALENTED...

14:04.667 --> 14:05.667
JANITOR.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.834
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.133
OF COURSE, I AM.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.300
IT'S WEIRD TO THINK

14:10.300 --> 14:13.500
BUD WON'T COME
THROUGH THOSE DOORS
ANYMORE.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.300
AND ONE MORE THING,

14:15.300 --> 14:16.834
I KNOW IT WAS YOU.

14:16.834 --> 14:20.967
I PUT
THE JANITOR'S CURSE
UPON YOU.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.233
ERIC...ERIC,
WAKE UP.

14:34.233 --> 14:37.000
JUST FIVE MORE MINUTES,
MOMMY.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.233
ERIC...

14:40.300 --> 14:41.767
OH, OH, MONIQUE.

14:41.767 --> 14:42.767
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

14:42.767 --> 14:45.834
DID YOU PAY ME
WHILE I WAS ASLEEP?

14:45.834 --> 14:48.467
LET ME ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

14:48.467 --> 14:50.200
QUESTIONS?
HEY, WAIT, WHOA...

14:50.200 --> 14:51.300
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

14:51.300 --> 14:55.300
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF SCAM, MISS...STAFF.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.300
YOU'LL GET PAID.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.300
I HAVE TO KNOW,

14:57.300 --> 14:59.500
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR DREAMS?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.700
MMM...NO.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.800
REMEMBER ANY DREAMS
FROM THE PAST
FEW MONTHS?

15:04.800 --> 15:05.800
YEARS EVEN?

15:05.800 --> 15:08.500
HOW CAN I?
I WAS ASLEEP.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.700
IT'S
THE ODDEST THING.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.700
WHAT IS?

15:10.700 --> 15:11.800
WHILE YOU SLEPT,

15:11.800 --> 15:15.100
YOU HAD
THIS SERENE LOOK.
ALMOST...GOOFY.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.300
THANK YOU.

15:16.300 --> 15:21.133
BUT, YOU REGISTERED
ABSOLUTELY
NO BRAIN ACTIVITY.

15:24.967 --> 15:25.967
IT'S REMARKABLE.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.700
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING
SINCE I WAS 5.

15:28.700 --> 15:32.767
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D LOVE TO RUN
ADDITIONAL TESTS.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.033
HOLD ON,
NOT SO FAST.

15:34.033 --> 15:37.233
YOU WANT MR. REMARKABLE,
IT WILL COST YOU.

15:37.233 --> 15:38.800
WHAT YOU'RE PAYING ME?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.500
I WANT HALF...

15:42.033 --> 15:43.600
AND THEN DOUBLE IT.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.467
YOU GOT IT.
ALL RIGHT!

15:50.800 --> 15:53.200
BOY, EVEN BERTHA
HATES US

15:53.200 --> 15:55.467
OVER THIS WHOLE
JANITOR THING.

15:55.467 --> 15:58.600
I'D SAY HATE IS
A STRONG WORD.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.100
READ YOUR BUN.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.100
"I HATE YOU."

16:04.667 --> 16:06.700
LOOK, SHAWN,
I'M A REPORTER,
O.K.?

16:06.700 --> 16:11.767
IT'S MY JOB
TO GET THE STORY,
NO MATTER WHAT.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.934
ARE YOU O.K.?

16:15.934 --> 16:16.934
JANITOR'S CURSE.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.734
DON'T LET IT
GET TO YOU, O.K.?

16:19.734 --> 16:21.033
THERE'S
NO SUCH THING.

16:21.033 --> 16:22.600
NOW,
LET'S JUST RELAX,

16:22.600 --> 16:26.000
SIT DOWN,
AND ENJOY OUR LUNCH.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.700
HEY, THERE,
MIND IF WE SIT HERE?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.200
AH...TAKEN.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.100
CORY,
THAT'S THE LAST TABLE.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.467
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

16:38.467 --> 16:40.500
NO. I WON'T BE
INTIMIDATED.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.734
IT WILL TAKE
SOMEONE
PRETTY BIG

16:42.734 --> 16:45.667
TO PUSH
CORY MATTHEWS
AROUND.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.400
I THINK
HE'S A WINNER.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.200
C'MON, LET'S GO.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.667
MATTHEWS
IS TAKING
A BEATING.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.100
HE HAD IT COMING.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.500
HIS STORY COST
BUD HIS JOB.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.100
WHOLE SCHOOL'S
ON HIS CASE.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.400
THAT WAS THE ASSIGNMENT,
WASN'T IT?

17:02.400 --> 17:06.200
YOU TOLD HIM TO
GET A HOT NEWS STORY.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.600
THAT'S
THE NEWS BUSINESS.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.033
THIS IS SCHOOL,
THEY'RE KIDS.

17:10.033 --> 17:12.200
EXACTLY.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.200
AND WHEN
I WAS DOING IT,

17:18.200 --> 17:19.200
IT SEEMED SO RIGHT.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.367
I THOUGHT SO.

17:20.367 --> 17:24.200
EVERYONE AT SCHOOL
IS TREATING ME
LIKE A JERK.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.934
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

17:25.934 --> 17:27.300
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.400
YOU'RE WRONG.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.834
AMY, DARLING,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:31.834 --> 17:34.500
BUD WAS CAUGHT
SKIPPING OFF
TO THE TRACK.

17:34.500 --> 17:37.600
HE WAS TWO MONTHS AWAY
FROM HIS PENSION.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.233
HE WAS
A TRIFECTA AWAY
FROM TAHITI.

17:41.233 --> 17:43.600
HONEY,
THE SCHOOL WAS HIS LIFE.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.200
UNTIL 2:55.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.500
AM I GETTING MIXED SIGNALS
FROM YOU GUYS?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.200
CORY, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOU.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.300
ALAN, YOU'RE BE--
NO.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.767
MOM, DAD,
I GOT GREAT NEWS.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.300
A LETTER FROM
PENNSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.300
YOU WERE ACCEPTED?

17:56.300 --> 17:59.133
BETTER.
THEY WANT TO STUDY ME.

17:59.133 --> 18:00.600
YEAH!

18:03.200 --> 18:06.900
EVERYBODY'S GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.900
TOPANGA, C'MON,

18:07.900 --> 18:10.100
PEOPLE HAVE
SHORT MEMORIES.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.467
LIKE THIS HAS
NEVER HAPPENED
TO YOU.

18:15.467 --> 18:18.100
[BELL RINGS]

18:18.100 --> 18:20.133
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.867
MAN,
THAT'S A BIG OL' FISH.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
YOU THINK?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.100
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.500
YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.967
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.800
AND LEAVE THE FISH.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.233
SO, HOW'S LIFE?

18:47.233 --> 18:48.233
I DON'T KNOW.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.700
BIG FISH
IN MY LOCKER,
YOU TELL ME.

18:50.700 --> 18:54.567
YOU DON'T DESERVE
ALL THIS GRIEF
OVER JANITOR BUD.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.734
I WAS
JUST A REPORTER

18:56.734 --> 18:58.133
DOING MY JOB.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.400
RIGHT?

19:00.400 --> 19:03.300
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.
YOU'RE A SCHOOL KID.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.867
THAT'S WHERE I MESSED UP.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.967
I TEACH ABOUT
THE NEWS,

19:06.967 --> 19:08.867
NOT PUT YOU IN IT.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.500
NOW I'M
REALLY CONFUSED.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.400
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT YOUR REPORT?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.667
I WAS PROUD OF IT.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.867
I HAD FUN DOING IT.

19:17.867 --> 19:20.300
HOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO BUD?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.667
I FEEL BAD FOR HIM.

19:22.667 --> 19:26.000
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO LOSE HIS JOB.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.867
WELCOME TO
THE NEWS BUSINESS.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.900
IT'S A TOUGH GAME
WHEN YOU CARE.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.467
I WAS WRONG
DOING MY STORY?

19:34.467 --> 19:35.867
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

19:35.867 --> 19:36.867
I WAS RIGHT?

19:36.867 --> 19:39.700
THERE ISN'T ALWAYS
A CLEAR ANSWER.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.800
BUT I'M A KID.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.600
I WANT IT BOTH WAYS.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.867
GOT A SECRET FOR YOU...

19:44.867 --> 19:46.867
We adults do, too.

19:51.367 --> 19:52.934
WHEN YOU
GET A CHANCE,

19:52.934 --> 19:55.900
I'D LIKE
ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.200
HELLO?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.100
HELLO!

20:03.200 --> 20:04.600
GEORGE,
GOT A MINUTE?

20:04.600 --> 20:06.100
MR. WILLIAMS...

20:06.100 --> 20:09.367
OH, AND MR. MATTHEWS.
IT'S A PARTY.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.100
YOU LET ME HANDLE THIS.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.200
REGARDING THIS
JANITOR BUD SITUATION,

20:14.200 --> 20:15.400
DON'T LET ME IMPLY

20:15.400 --> 20:18.133
YOU'VE SAID OR DONE
ANYTHING AT ALL IN--

20:18.133 --> 20:22.834
JUST GIVE
THE OLD GAMBLER
HIS JOB BACK.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.567
SMOOTH, MATTHEWS.

20:24.567 --> 20:26.000
GENTLEMEN,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.567
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.233
THE MATTER'S CLOSED.

20:29.233 --> 20:31.233
LOOK,
THIS IS MY FAULT,

20:31.233 --> 20:33.767
I SHOULD'VE
SCREENED THE TAPES.

20:33.767 --> 20:35.367
THEY WENT
ON THE AIR

20:35.367 --> 20:38.000
TO THE ENTIRE
SCHOOL BOARD.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.200
I HAD NO CHOICE.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.133
TWO MORE MONTHS
AND HE RETIRES
WITH A FULL PENSION.

20:43.133 --> 20:46.400
AND AFTER HE SAVED
YOUR LIFE.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.934
FOR GOD'S SAKE,

20:47.934 --> 20:49.500
I SAW THAT WAX.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.300
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU HAD
A HEART OF GOLD.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.834
NOW I SEE
THE TRUTH. I--

20:55.834 --> 20:58.600
HERE'S YOUR
STINKING COFFEE.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.667
THAT JANITOR BUD'S
YOUR SECRETARY.

21:03.734 --> 21:04.834
AND BY THE WAY,

21:04.834 --> 21:07.367
GO EASY
ON THAT BUZZER.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.734
IT AIN'T A TOY,
YOU KNOW.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.500
TWO MONTHS, HUH?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.233
COASTERS, FEENY...

21:18.233 --> 21:20.800
COASTERS.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.367
BLAST MY HEART OF GOLD.

21:29.233 --> 21:34.700
THANKS FOR FLYING IN
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.000
AS YOU CAN SEE,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.133
TODAY'S RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT
WITH PREVIOUS RESEARCH.

21:39.133 --> 21:44.567
FAST ASLEEP, AND
NO BRAIN ACTIVITY WHATSOEVER.

21:44.567 --> 21:48.467
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
NO, HE'S NOT DEAD.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.300
ERIC. ERIC.

21:49.300 --> 21:50.667
HMM?

21:51.734 --> 21:54.867
WHAT'S UP, DOCS?

21:54.867 --> 21:58.700
MONIQUE, HOW'D I DO?
REMARKABLE?

21:58.700 --> 22:01.467
ERIC, YOU ARE THE MOST
CONTENT INDIVIDUAL.

22:01.467 --> 22:04.000
NO CARES OR WORRIES.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.200
YOU ARE ONE OF A KIND.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.500
EXCELLENT. HOW'D
THE LITTLE MOUSE DO?

22:10.500 --> 22:12.400
THIS COMMON FIELD MOUSE

22:12.400 --> 22:17.300
HAS FEARS, HOPES,
DREAMS, GOALS...

22:17.300 --> 22:18.767
POOR LITTLE GUY.
