- What's up, guys?

00:08.708 --> 00:09.909
Welcome to
"The Dude Perfect Show."

00:09.976 --> 00:11.244
Fun fact about me.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.913
Two things I've always loved:
magic and cooking.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.116
Specifically hibachi.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.884
It's the greatest
dinner show of all time.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.786
- True.
- So I've got the bright idea.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.188
We can combine hibachi and magic

00:22.255 --> 00:25.024
for the ultimate
all-time show ever.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.126
Perform it for the wives.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.961
Sounds like a great night to me.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.362
What are you guys think?
- I'm down.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.264
- Some might even call me
a Chefgician

00:31.331 --> 00:33.032
when we're done with this.
- A what?

00:33.099 --> 00:34.567
- I think you just
called yourself that.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.069
- A Chefgician.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.638
You just combine being a chef--
if that suits you better--

00:38.705 --> 00:40.807
with magic.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.542
- So you're a "chagic."

00:42.609 --> 00:43.810
- Do you know any magic tricks?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.311
- Absolutely.
Check this out.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.180
Let me toss
those down for a second. Coby--

00:47.247 --> 00:49.749
- You make those disappear.
- --pick a card.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.317
Show the audience,
don't show me.

00:51.384 --> 00:56.423
I am sensing that
this is a nine of spades.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.391

to the world of hibachi?

05:07.573 --> 05:10.109
this might be good for dessert.
- Okay.

- Four.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.490
- Okay, real quick.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.258
If I could have somebody
inspect this for me.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.660
What does that look
like to you guys?

07:40.726 --> 07:42.895
- Um, some matches.
- Okay. Inspect 'em,

07:42.962 --> 07:45.331
make sure it's a real matchbook,
full of real matches.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.766
- Like matches to me.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.801
- Okay, cool, if you'll just
see--the one thing about being

07:48.868 --> 07:50.837
a hibachi chef is you gotta have
kinda like ninja-like powers.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.106
So if you wanna do
something like this.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.208
- Oh.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.409
- [laughing]

07:56.475 --> 07:58.845
- ALL: [cheering]

07:58.911 --> 07:59.879
- Chefgician.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.681
- Chefgician, thank you.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.883
What do you guys say
we turn it up a notch?

08:03.950 --> 08:05.084
- Heat up in the kitchen.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.119
- Are you serious?
- So nervous.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.856
- A lot more, a lot more.
- Ohhh!

08:09.922 --> 08:11.757
- Hey!
- [applause]

08:11.824 --> 08:14.427
- Alright.
- Get a little spin, and then.

08:14.493 --> 08:17.763
- ALL: [cheering]

08:17.830 --> 08:20.166
- Alright, who's ready
for some fried rice, huh?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.835
- So this is safe to eat?
- I would let it cool down.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.137
- Who wants double-fried rice?
Oh, Cor.

08:25.204 --> 08:26.272
- I'm a risk taker.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.007
- Alright, there you go.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.175
Okay, moving right along.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.743
Who's ready to see
another magic trick?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.211
- Oh, I am.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.580
- Got a few bananas for dessert
in case anybody's feeling it.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.849
So fun fact actually
about chopsticks.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.986
You can actually cut a banana
in the peel with chopsticks

08:40.052 --> 08:41.486
by hitting it hard enough.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.956
Allison, please pick a number
between one and five.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.324
- Three.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.593
- I'm gonna take this banana
and cut it into three slices

08:47.660 --> 08:49.528
for you without ever
opening the peel.

08:49.595 --> 08:50.897
So here's how you do it.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.566
Garrett, if you would,
hold the banana for me.

08:53.633 --> 08:57.169
The key is to hit it quickly
but also with authority.

08:57.236 --> 08:58.838
- Oh. [laughing]

08:58.905 --> 09:01.140
- [snapping]

09:01.207 --> 09:03.409
- ALL: [laughing]

09:03.476 --> 09:05.077
- Okay, open up our banana.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.316
And what do we have
right here, my friends.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.284
- Oh, stop it.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.318
- Oh, wow!

09:12.385 --> 09:13.552
- How'd you do that?

09:13.619 --> 09:15.354
- Three slices of banana.

09:15.421 --> 09:16.455
- That was impressive.

09:16.522 --> 09:17.890
- Thank you. Alright.

09:17.957 --> 09:19.258
Veggie time!

09:19.325 --> 09:21.861
- [rattling noise]

09:21.928 --> 09:23.396
- Do you want
double veggies, Amy?

09:23.462 --> 09:24.764
- Sure.
- This is really good.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.465
- This is actually really good.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.466
Impressed.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.567
- Thank you.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.369
And now for my final trick.

09:30.436 --> 09:32.271
Anybody play cards here?

09:32.338 --> 09:34.573
Oh, a little bit, okay.
- I dabble.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.911
- Alright, so, Kristin,
take the bottom card.

09:38.978 --> 09:39.946
Alright, show the girls.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.682
Do not show me.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.183
Okay, you guys got it?
- Yep.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.885
- Can I turn around?

09:45.952 --> 09:48.087
Neat little trick a lot of
people don't know is you can

09:48.154 --> 09:49.956
actually feel what card
is missing out of a deck.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.124
So if I go through--
- I did not know that.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.492
- Heart, spade, spade.

09:53.559 --> 09:54.894
- ALL: [laughing]

09:54.961 --> 09:57.763
- So rather than tell ya,
I'm gonna show you the card.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.865
So I've got a piece
of tissue paper here.

09:59.932 --> 10:04.003
And then I am going to reveal
to you what your card was.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.906
Can I have my assistant
light the paper, please?

10:06.973 --> 10:08.674
- Yep.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.143
- Oh.
- Hey.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.778
Careful there, Assistant Gar.

10:12.845 --> 10:15.247
- [laughs]

10:15.314 --> 10:17.750
- I'm so intrigued.

10:17.817 --> 10:18.818
- No.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.087
- ♪

10:21.153 --> 10:24.523
- Is that a four?

10:24.590 --> 10:26.258
- It's a four of--

10:26.325 --> 10:28.361
- Diamonds.

10:28.427 --> 10:29.562
- No way.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.998
- How in the world?

10:32.064 --> 10:34.500
- Was your card
the four of diamonds?

10:34.567 --> 10:36.969
- ALL: [cheering]

10:37.036 --> 10:37.937
- Thank you.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.038
- I'm a believer.

10:39.105 --> 10:42.641
- ALL: [cheering]

10:42.708 --> 10:44.944
- Alright, ladies,
what did you think?

10:45.011 --> 10:45.978
- Awesome.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.079
- Good job.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.581
- Alright, thank you
guys for joining us.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.383
And, oh--you know what?

10:50.449 --> 10:52.051
I think we've got some
activity upstairs.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.653
It's been about 30 minutes
since we tossed the egg up.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.123
- No way.
- What?

10:57.189 --> 11:00.192
- ALL: [cheering]

11:00.259 --> 11:01.394
- Is that a duck?

11:01.460 --> 11:04.663
- We have a baby duck
joining us today.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.499
Oh, thank you, thank you.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.967
Alright.

11:08.034 --> 11:10.569
Let's get you back
over to your mom.

11:10.636 --> 11:11.604
Thank you for joining us.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.105
I'm the Dynamite Kid.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.207
Thank you for coming
to the Chefgician show.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.742
- ALL: [cheering]

11:16.809 --> 11:18.511
- TYLER: I'm pretty sure
he pooed on my head.

11:18.577 --> 11:19.545
- [laughs]

11:19.612 --> 11:20.946
{\an8}- We've decided
to enter you guys

11:21.013 --> 11:23.015
{\an8}in a local fourth grade
science fair.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.283
{\an8}- Oh boy.
- No way.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.618
{\an8}- It's volcano time!

11:25.684 --> 11:27.386
{\an8}- ALL: [cheering]

11:27.453 --> 11:29.722
{\an8}- Go!

11:29.789 --> 11:30.890
{\an8}- Are you kidding me?

11:32.291 --> 11:34.226
- What's up, guys? Welcome to
"The Dude Perfect Show."

11:34.293 --> 11:35.628
Quick question for you guys.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.696
Raise your hand if you ever
competed in the science fair?

11:37.763 --> 11:38.831
- Oh.
- Definitely.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.599
- Silver medal.
- What is the deal?

11:40.666 --> 11:42.435
- What?
- No science fair for you.

11:42.501 --> 11:43.602
- We were
homeschooled one year.

11:43.669 --> 11:44.870
Fourth grade.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.006
And I guess we never
got a chance to do one.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.741
- The twins have never
experienced the science fair.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.043
So we've decided
to enter you guys

11:51.110 --> 11:53.112
in a local
fourth grade science fair.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.280
- No way.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.382
- So two things make
a science fair project.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.483
- Tell me.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.418
- A great name,
and a good project.

11:59.485 --> 12:00.986
Notice how I put it
in that order.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.822
- Are you gonna help me
with a good name?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.056
- That's up to you guys.

12:04.123 --> 12:05.958
Do you wanna know
my project was in third grade?

12:06.025 --> 12:09.061
- BOTH: Tell me.
- Ty's Egg-cellent Project.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.130
- Classic.
- Did it have to do with eggs?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.264
- There you go, Cods!

12:12.331 --> 12:14.100
That is a man who's been
to the science fair.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.935
Alright, you guys better
put your thinking caps on,

12:16.001 --> 12:17.937
you guys are going to be
presenting some ideas to us.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.538
And in the end,
at the science fair,

12:19.605 --> 12:20.940
we're gonna be the judges.
- Oh boy.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.708
- Gosh.
- You guys ready to get going?

12:22.775 --> 12:25.044
- Let's do it.
- Here we go!

12:25.111 --> 12:27.513
- ♪ La, la, la, here we go ♪♪

12:27.580 --> 12:29.515
- ♪

12:29.582 --> 12:30.850
- Thanks for joining us today.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.986
We would like to present to you
our favorite options

12:34.053 --> 12:35.754
for our science fair project.

12:35.821 --> 12:37.356
- Can't wait to see 'em.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.860
- Let me hit you guys
with a couple potential names.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.597
The first name is "Twins:
just how similar are we?"

12:44.663 --> 12:46.165
- Pretty--pretty similar.

12:46.232 --> 12:46.999
- Alright, here we go.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.300
"You Wish You Were A Twin."

12:48.367 --> 12:49.535
- "Don't You?"

12:49.602 --> 12:51.504
- What do you say
we head to the next one?

12:51.570 --> 12:54.006
- You know how when you give
someone the perfect high five,

12:54.073 --> 12:55.474
it doesn't sound like that.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.776
It sounds like...that.

12:57.843 --> 12:58.911
- I'm actually intrigued.

12:58.978 --> 13:00.513
- We'll show 'em
bad, good, bad, good.

13:00.579 --> 13:02.715
- Bad, good, bad.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.884
[laughing]

13:04.950 --> 13:06.318
- Bang.
- Okay.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.754
- That's a piece of junk.
Let's move to the next one.

13:08.821 --> 13:11.223
- Guys, we have one left,
and it's the best one yet.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.458
- Here we go.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.126
- "Athlete's Foot."

13:14.193 --> 13:15.728
- Get your shoe off
our dinner table.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.264
- We are athletes,
we all have feet.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.266
And we think athlete's foot,
the disease,

13:20.332 --> 13:21.967
needs to be delved into
a little bit.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.402
- Please direct your attention
to the book.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.271
- What is the project about?
What are we testing?

13:25.337 --> 13:28.707
- We are going to give ourselves
athlete's foot.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.376
- Ew.
- Hold on, hold on.

13:30.442 --> 13:31.477
- He's being serious.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.045
- You're gonna give
yourself a disease--

13:33.112 --> 13:34.947
- You don't know how to give
yourself athlete's foot.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.949
Where do you go
get athlete's foot?

13:37.016 --> 13:38.617
- Locker rooms.
- Don't know.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.953
- Why did you
write-out after "foot"?

13:41.020 --> 13:43.422
- Okay, Cory made the binder.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.957
- Why did Cory white-out?

13:45.024 --> 13:46.258
- Well, he put "foots."

13:46.325 --> 13:50.663
- ALL: [laughing]

13:50.729 --> 13:52.631
- To be fair, they missed out
on fourth grade.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.233
- Let me blow your mind
with this title.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.436
"Athlete's foot:
the foot's fungus among-us."

13:57.503 --> 13:59.038
- ALL: [laughing]

13:59.104 --> 14:01.340
- That's a great name.
Bad project.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.641
- Here's the deal.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.376
These projects are horrible.

14:04.443 --> 14:08.714
- I think we stick to the more
textbook science fair projects.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.683
The drop the egg
with a parachute.

14:10.749 --> 14:12.151
- Volcano.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.086
- The volcano...could
be right up their alley.

14:14.153 --> 14:14.954
- Yep.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.322
- Uh, people make volcanos?

14:16.388 --> 14:17.890
Is that what you're saying?
I don't understand.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.925
- You are in for a treat,
my friend.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.461
- Simple, easy to build.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.796
- And can make a statement.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.798
- Makes a statement
if you do it the right way.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.266
- We accept.
Thank you for your help.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.469
- I'm gonna leave this if you
wanna pass it on to your kids

14:30.536 --> 14:31.804
as they get older.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.739
- Don't forget,
we'll be showing up to judge it,

14:33.806 --> 14:35.608
so it better be good!
- The fungus among-us.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.209
- [laughs] What a great name.

14:37.276 --> 14:40.212
- ♪

14:44.250 --> 14:45.584
- Volcano time.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.820
- You get chicken wire, I'll
grab some of this other stuff.

14:47.886 --> 14:49.555
- Should we wrap it
all the way around?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.724
- You know what's actually
unfair about the situation?

14:51.790 --> 14:53.859
All those fourth graders
have their parents.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.060
- No doubt.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.862
- How we looking, boys?
Is it lava time?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.464
- You are right on time.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.299
- It's not lava time.
- Well--

15:00.366 --> 15:02.134
- I thought you said
you were doing a volcano?

15:02.201 --> 15:03.602
- Dude, this is a volcano.

15:03.669 --> 15:04.837
- What is happening right now?

15:04.903 --> 15:06.038
- I'll tell you
what's happening.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.506
Our Science Fair Dad
just walked in.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.641
- No.

15:08.707 --> 15:09.875
Absolutely not.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.677
- Ty here to save the day.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.279
- No, I completed fourth grade.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.213
I did my projects.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.781
- Which is why you're perfect.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.516
- Forget about that.
This is not a volcano.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.119
What is this?
- Close your eyes for a second.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.255
Keep them open, because
that would hard to see.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.557
The vision, Ty, was we
wrap it around, we lean it in,

15:25.624 --> 15:28.127
you know, towards the middle,
very volcano like.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.728
- Tick, tick, tick, phow!

15:29.795 --> 15:31.297
- This is the whole volcano?

15:31.363 --> 15:33.198
No, no, no!

15:33.265 --> 15:34.967
It's gotta be
way bigger than this.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.169
So explain to me why
we have dinosaurs.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.672
- Well, back in the day,
when the dinosaurs were around,

15:39.738 --> 15:42.708
they would roam the volcanos--

15:42.775 --> 15:44.510
- --as a source of warmth.

15:44.576 --> 15:45.944
- [laughs] That's so not true.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.046
- It probably is true.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.547
- No, absolutely not.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.251
- Never seen a dinosaur just
laying up against a volcano?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.186
- Dude, they cozy up
against 'canos all the time.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.854
- No, they don't.
- They do.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.057

- Cory.

Ty, I didn't hear check.

16:03.395 --> 16:04.530
- Okay.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.899

actually go and clear out.

Are you good over there?

- Yeah, I don't think you--
- Dude, it's coming.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.047
It's gonna explode.

16:22.114 --> 16:23.415
- Get ready to duck.

16:25.517 --> 16:26.485

16:26.552 --> 16:30.656

sprung a leak.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.958
What kind of grade do you think
this would have got you?

16:33.025 --> 16:34.560
- Um, like a C minus.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.495
- No. No, not even.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.430
Think about it from
a Dude Perfect perspective.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.599
We don't go out and do
regular basketball shots.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.900

16:47.272 --> 16:49.074
I want it to be
the biggest volcano.

16:49.141 --> 16:50.309
You gotta yell,
"Fire in the hole,"

a little help building it,

What is the project about?

17:32.050 --> 17:33.252
What are we testing?

by touching people

and the importance
of washing your hands.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.161

that start off the day

being sick or infected,
the more people by midday

17:48.066 --> 17:49.201

what's the conclusion?

love big explosions.

19:56.929 --> 20:00.966
- Will a bigger volcano
produce a bigger explosion?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.902
- To be honest with you,
a big explosion

20:03.969 --> 20:06.204
can make up for
a lack of science.
