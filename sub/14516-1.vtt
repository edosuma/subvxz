03:02.430 --> 03:05.922
That stunning second round
knockout was the crowning moment...

03:06.101 --> 03:08.865
of Wayne Barclay's
brilliant boxing career.

03:09.037 --> 03:12.298
Since retiring from the ring,
he hasn't looked back.

03:12.474 --> 03:14.772
Using the millions he'd won
from prizefighting...

03:14.943 --> 03:17.411
Wayne turned
his prodigious energies towards...

03:17.579 --> 03:20.844
revitalizing the neighborhood
he'd been born and raised in.

03:21.016 --> 03:23.880
Starting with a few fast-food restaurants...

03:24.252 --> 03:26.318
he soon moved on to shopping centers.

03:26.488 --> 03:29.514
Then movie theaters,
and then office buildings.

03:29.691 --> 03:32.216
It wasn't long before the revenues
from these ventures...

03:32.394 --> 03:35.955
allowed him the opportunity to
tear down long-abandoned slums...

03:36.131 --> 03:40.067
and replace them with clean,
affordable housing.

03:40.669 --> 03:45.470
And on the legal front today,
an unexpected development....

03:57.319 --> 04:01.052
How come my fountain keeps shrinking
every time you people walk out of here?

04:01.223 --> 04:06.320
Excuse me. Mr. Barclay,
there are codes we have to follow.

04:06.761 --> 04:09.924
Look, I ain't asking for Niagara Falls.

04:10.532 --> 04:12.625
I appreciate that.
But the codes are the codes.

04:12.801 --> 04:16.031
Look, I just want a damn fountain
that will make this place feel like...

04:16.204 --> 04:17.466
like something special.

04:17.639 --> 04:18.628
You know?

04:18.807 --> 04:21.071
Just something to make
the local residents feel...

04:21.243 --> 04:23.734
that their part of town
is just as good as any other.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.280
Wayne, quick, turn on the news.

04:26.448 --> 04:29.781
- Tamara, we happen to be meeting.
- You need to see this.

04:30.485 --> 04:32.453
You do need to see this, Wayne.

04:32.621 --> 04:35.954
The early release which took
prosecutors by surprise...

04:36.124 --> 04:39.184
was approved today at
a state parole board hearing.

04:39.694 --> 04:42.390
Rap-music mogul Terrell Singletery...

04:42.564 --> 04:46.091
had been sentenced to
10 years for racketeering...

04:46.268 --> 04:50.204
money laundering and witness
intimidation among other charges.

04:50.372 --> 04:53.864
But citing his outstanding
behavior in prison...

04:54.042 --> 04:56.704
and his contributions
to numerous charities...

04:56.878 --> 04:59.403
during his 18 months of incarceration...

04:59.915 --> 05:04.079
the parole board commuted
his remaining sentence to probation.

05:04.252 --> 05:07.483
Look, the DA promised the man would
be serving no less than eight years.

05:07.656 --> 05:09.317
This was not supposed to happen.

05:09.491 --> 05:12.824
Well, thanks to his hotshot
new attorney, it did.

05:12.994 --> 05:15.462
All right, so what do you want me
to do about it?

05:15.630 --> 05:17.393
Dig a hole and hide like a gopher?

05:17.565 --> 05:19.157
The man's on probation.

05:19.334 --> 05:22.599
He so much as spits on the sidewalk,
his black ass is back in the pen.

05:22.771 --> 05:25.035
Not concerned about him
spitting on the sidewalk.

05:25.206 --> 05:29.074
Terrell Singletery's been known to put
out a hit for disrespecting his name.

05:29.511 --> 05:30.773
Yeah?

05:30.946 --> 05:33.540
I did a lot worse than that
and I'm standing here, ain't I?

05:33.715 --> 05:37.242
Come tomorrow, they will no longer
be monitoring his calls.

05:37.419 --> 05:39.944
They won't be eavesdropping
when he's with his attorneys.

05:40.121 --> 05:41.520
He'll be running the streets...

05:41.690 --> 05:44.591
and you wanna know what his
first order of business will be?

05:44.759 --> 05:47.159
To send a message to whoever put him away.

05:47.329 --> 05:49.797
Wayne, please listen to me.

05:49.965 --> 05:52.365
You need some serious protection.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.263
Sis, I got protection.

05:54.436 --> 05:56.165
Okay? I got protection.

05:56.338 --> 05:59.830
I mean, why else are we paying
my head of security here?

06:00.008 --> 06:02.340
You need to listen to
your sister on this one, Wayne.

06:02.510 --> 06:05.536
- You need extra protection.
- Damn.

06:05.714 --> 06:08.911
Look, let me tell you all something.
Wayne Barclay does not back down...

06:09.084 --> 06:10.847
from any motherfucker on this planet.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.619
- Wayne.
- Wayne.

06:13.788 --> 06:17.986
Look, if Terrell wants a piece of me,
he knows where to find me. Know that.

06:18.159 --> 06:19.456
No.

06:23.665 --> 06:25.326
Mr. Mullins...

06:25.500 --> 06:29.027
what exactly did you mean by
"extra protection"?

06:52.861 --> 06:56.092
Mr. Singletery. Mr. Singletery, over here.

06:56.531 --> 06:59.329
Hey, what does it feel like
to be a free man, Terrell?

06:59.501 --> 07:02.265
- Back off.
- How does it feel to be a free man?

07:02.437 --> 07:03.665
Liberating.

07:06.708 --> 07:09.336
We're just doing our job here, okay?
Don't be so heavy.

07:09.511 --> 07:12.605
Uncle T, over here, let's go.

07:12.781 --> 07:15.716
- All right, let's move, let's move.
- Get your hands off of me.

07:22.157 --> 07:25.024
- Get the door. Come on.
- What are your feelings towards...

07:25.193 --> 07:27.184
Wayne Barclay, whose evidence
put you away?

07:27.362 --> 07:29.057
That's enough. No more questions.

07:29.230 --> 07:30.754
It's cool, Leonard, it's cool.

07:30.932 --> 07:34.459
I understand Mr. Barclay has been
doing fine work for our community.

07:34.636 --> 07:38.094
Now, at this point in my life, I
simply say forgive and forget.

07:38.273 --> 07:40.070
And God bless. Excuse me.

07:40.241 --> 07:41.936
What was it like inside, Terrell?

07:42.110 --> 07:44.078
Sergeant Major Clarence Bowden.

07:44.813 --> 07:47.543
That's us in Kuwait,
just after Desert Storm.

07:47.715 --> 07:50.445
Lucky for us, he's retired
and out looking for something.

07:50.952 --> 07:52.214
Impressive resume.

07:54.122 --> 07:56.784
But we're not exactly
fighting a war here, Mullins.

07:57.225 --> 07:59.785
And I'm sure hoping it stays that way.

08:00.495 --> 08:02.429
My point is...

08:02.597 --> 08:04.064
does your friend understand...

08:04.232 --> 08:07.065
the finer nuances of executive protection?

08:07.235 --> 08:09.760
Pentagon had him in charge of
Primary Subject Security...

08:09.938 --> 08:12.873
in Afghanistan. Bodyguarding generals.

08:13.541 --> 08:16.032
Before that he did
the same thing in Haiti.

08:16.945 --> 08:20.403
I'm not saying Clarence Bowden
is the only choice we've got...

08:21.149 --> 08:23.174
I'm saying we'd be damn lucky to have him.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.414
Get yourself together, soldier.

08:55.984 --> 08:57.645
I got a mission for you.

09:05.393 --> 09:07.020
I found us a gig.

09:36.124 --> 09:38.115
It's about time.

09:39.093 --> 09:40.958
Yeah.

09:44.065 --> 09:46.192
Yo, boss.

09:49.137 --> 09:51.435
Welcome home.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.873
Nice drive?

09:54.042 --> 09:55.566
Yeah.

09:55.743 --> 09:58.211
Took the scenic route.

10:01.115 --> 10:04.141
- Saw you on TV.
- Come on.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.015
Yo, B.

10:08.189 --> 10:11.556
What's up on this forgive and forget
noise you been talking about, man?

10:11.726 --> 10:13.785
Oh, forgive me for lying.

10:13.962 --> 10:15.657
Forget I said that.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.765
About to turn this bitch into a war zone.

10:18.933 --> 10:23.165
Excuse me, Uncle T, but what
happened to the new agenda?

10:23.338 --> 10:26.466
The one we talked about.
You know, "Increase the peace."

10:27.108 --> 10:28.575
Oh, that's gonna come.

10:28.743 --> 10:31.803
But first, folks in this city
need to know...

10:32.180 --> 10:35.274
no one makes a chump
out of Terrell Singletery.

10:39.387 --> 10:41.116
Uncle T.

10:42.457 --> 10:44.186
Jesus, Uncle T, you're on probation.

10:44.359 --> 10:46.884
If the business attorney knew
you were talking this way...

10:47.061 --> 10:49.552
He ain't gonna know.
Simcoe, you had the house swept?

10:49.731 --> 10:51.665
They're not gonna bug the house.
They can't.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.801
We'd nail their ass to the wall.

10:53.968 --> 10:56.266
But if Wayne Barclay were to
meet an untimely end...

10:56.437 --> 10:58.905
under any circumstances,
they're gonna blame you.

10:59.073 --> 11:01.405
Would you listen to this shit.

11:01.643 --> 11:05.477
They teach you those big words in
that fancy law college you went to?

11:05.647 --> 11:07.410
Yes, they did, Uncle T.

11:07.582 --> 11:10.415
Thanks to you and your generosity.

11:10.585 --> 11:11.950
Yeah.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.645
Listen to this little motherfucker
right here.

11:14.822 --> 11:16.050
This little nigga...

11:16.224 --> 11:18.089
he would have got Michael Jackson off...

11:18.259 --> 11:21.023
and got him custody of them two damn kids.

11:21.496 --> 11:23.020
Thanks.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.628
Sergeant major.

11:26.801 --> 11:28.826
- Plain old Clarence now.
- How are you, Ken?

11:29.003 --> 11:30.265
- Looking good.
- You too.

11:30.438 --> 11:33.339
- Life on the outside treating you well?
- Can't complain.

11:33.775 --> 11:35.834
Oh, I brought along an associate of mine.

11:36.010 --> 11:39.343
This is Philippe Sauvage. We served
together in Afghanistan and Iraq.

11:41.749 --> 11:43.341
And this is Tamara Barclay.

11:43.851 --> 11:46.911
Wayne's sister and chief financial
officer of Barclay Enterprises.

11:47.088 --> 11:49.113
The lady whose
signature goes on the check.

11:49.557 --> 11:51.787
I am. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Bowden.

11:51.959 --> 11:53.893
- The pleasure's mine, ma'am.
- Have a seat.

11:54.062 --> 11:58.897
I'm assuming that Mr. Mullins
briefed you about our situation.

11:59.067 --> 12:02.662
Has he also explained that my brother
can be extremely hardheaded?

12:02.837 --> 12:05.101
Well, it's a pretty good trait
for a boxer to have.

12:05.273 --> 12:07.537
One of the reasons
he still has his wits about him.

12:07.709 --> 12:10.007
Unfortunately, he's in
a different arena now.

12:10.178 --> 12:12.169
His opponent isn't wearing gloves.

12:12.347 --> 12:14.008
His opponent is playing for keeps.

12:14.182 --> 12:16.673
That's the kind of arena we understand.

12:16.851 --> 12:20.719
My brother doesn't understand
that his life is in serious danger.

12:20.888 --> 12:23.413
And while it's true
that I sign the checks...

12:23.591 --> 12:26.651
he's the one who makes the
major decisions for this corporation.

12:27.095 --> 12:29.893
So, what I need is someone who can be...

12:30.064 --> 12:32.760
Wayne Barclay's unseen guardian angel.

12:35.703 --> 12:36.727
Well...

12:36.904 --> 12:40.169
I liked Bowden. Liked him very much.

12:40.341 --> 12:41.603
And...

12:41.776 --> 12:43.334
the other guy?

12:44.178 --> 12:45.475
Forget about it.

12:45.646 --> 12:47.011
She hates me.

12:47.181 --> 12:49.342
We were discussing a gig,
not a blind date.

12:49.517 --> 12:51.815
Yeah. A gig we don't need.

12:51.986 --> 12:54.682
I don't. You do.

12:55.356 --> 12:59.224
Something about him seemed,
I don't know, unsettling.

13:00.261 --> 13:03.094
A year in Afghanistan followed by
a couple more in Iraq...

13:03.264 --> 13:04.595
might do it to you.

13:05.266 --> 13:06.631
Listen, Philippe...

13:06.801 --> 13:09.827
I was in the same kind of funk
when I got back from Vietnam.

13:10.004 --> 13:11.767
And for some of the same reasons too.

13:11.939 --> 13:14.874
You've come a long way.
And I'm proud of you for that.

13:15.042 --> 13:17.909
But you're not all the way there yet.

13:18.346 --> 13:20.439
Now, you reading me, soldier?

13:21.949 --> 13:23.314
Loud and clear.

13:23.484 --> 13:24.883
Okay.

13:25.052 --> 13:28.044
You need to get back into the flow.
Take the next step.

13:28.222 --> 13:29.587
Get a job.

13:29.757 --> 13:31.190
You know, come to think of it...

13:31.359 --> 13:34.453
a blind date might not be
a bad idea either.

13:34.629 --> 13:36.563
And that's part of a 12-step program?

13:36.731 --> 13:40.132
I'm serious. When is the last time
you had your ham glazed?

13:42.603 --> 13:43.831
Enough.

13:44.005 --> 13:45.131
- What?
- Enough.

13:45.306 --> 13:47.831
Could do something about
that uptight attitude.

13:48.009 --> 13:51.103
Hell, might even put a smile on your face.

13:51.279 --> 13:53.179
Is it wrong to expect these bodyguards...

13:53.347 --> 13:55.611
to blend seamlessly
into my brother's life?

13:55.783 --> 13:58.911
Well, we didn't exactly
blend in Afghanistan.

13:59.086 --> 14:01.350
Look, Bowden says he's the best.

14:01.522 --> 14:03.114
And isn't that the bottom line here?

14:03.291 --> 14:05.316
Protecting your brother's life?

14:07.495 --> 14:09.554
Besides, haven't we been pushing for...

14:09.730 --> 14:11.823
some affirmative action around here?

14:11.999 --> 14:14.297
You know I hate when you
play the race card on me.

14:14.469 --> 14:16.767
- Yeah, I know.
- But fine.

14:18.139 --> 14:20.699
Well, we've got that
hip-hop event coming up.

14:21.309 --> 14:22.537
Which I've been dreading.

14:23.678 --> 14:25.077
Been to that club before.

14:25.246 --> 14:26.645
It'll be crowded, noisy...

14:26.814 --> 14:28.372
dark, crowded with groupies.

14:28.549 --> 14:31.882
And the security will be an absolute joke.

14:33.554 --> 14:37.149
Sounds like a perfect opportunity
to give your boys a trial run.

14:38.459 --> 14:42.623
And remember, my brother
is to remain blissfully unaware.

14:42.797 --> 14:45.698
Unless it becomes absolutely necessary.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.677
Hey, over here.

15:01.182 --> 15:03.446
- Let's get a photo.
- Come on, man.

15:03.618 --> 15:05.848
Come on. Excuse us, ladies, please.

15:12.226 --> 15:14.353
- Hey, Wayne.
- Go inside now.

15:14.529 --> 15:16.326
Use your VIP passes. You're on the list.

15:18.633 --> 15:20.999
Reporting for duty, sir.

15:29.744 --> 15:33.202
Hey, what's up, son? Hey, keep doing
your thing, man, it's nice.

15:36.150 --> 15:39.347
All right, man, what do you think
of these two right here?

15:41.355 --> 15:43.789
Still playing the same
old game. Check this out.

15:44.392 --> 15:47.486
Oh, yeah, we gonna have
a good time with that. Right over here.

16:03.811 --> 16:06.109
I'm gonna need a week
of concentrated Marvin Gaye...

16:06.280 --> 16:08.305
to purge the noise out of my head.

16:10.418 --> 16:12.818
- Are you good to go?
- Sure.

16:12.987 --> 16:14.614
Okay.

16:23.331 --> 16:26.391
Yeah, I'd just like to welcome
everybody to the house tonight.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.967
We got a special guest
in the building tonight.

16:29.136 --> 16:30.467
You all know who he is.

16:30.638 --> 16:33.869
Very special guest. Put your hands
together for the one, the only...

16:34.041 --> 16:36.669
the world heavyweight champion,
Wayne Barclay.

16:36.844 --> 16:38.744
Put your hands together, y'all.

17:13.414 --> 17:14.938
Excuse me.

17:15.148 --> 17:17.049
- Whoa, hey.
- Sorry.

17:18.486 --> 17:22.444
- Sorry, bro.
- I said move. Let's get out of here.

17:22.623 --> 17:24.386
Watch where you going, clown.

17:26.993 --> 17:29.963
So much for remaining unseen.

17:31.799 --> 17:34.063
You gotta admit he does stick out.

17:34.235 --> 17:36.430
Like a sore thumb.

17:36.604 --> 17:39.334
Look, Mullins, I know you meant well...

17:39.507 --> 17:41.532
but this isn't gonna work.

17:42.143 --> 17:44.077
Say no more.

17:48.683 --> 17:49.911
Yeah.

17:50.084 --> 17:52.018
That's what I heard.

17:56.457 --> 18:00.951
Maybe I should wait outside
and keep an eye on the car.

18:01.128 --> 18:02.857
I'll let Bowden know.

18:03.030 --> 18:04.622
Thank you.

18:30.891 --> 18:32.620
Send the car.

18:37.064 --> 18:39.294
Phil, I need to tell you something.

18:39.467 --> 18:42.061
This gig's not working out.

18:43.270 --> 18:44.760
It's not you.

18:44.939 --> 18:46.600
Oh, come on, Clarence.

18:46.774 --> 18:49.242
I sensed the vibe in her office.

18:49.477 --> 18:51.502
Bad chemistry.

18:51.679 --> 18:56.480
Nobody's fault. Hey, that's life, huh?

19:00.087 --> 19:01.918
There's the car.

19:20.241 --> 19:22.072
- No autographs.
- No, it's cool. It's cool.

19:22.243 --> 19:24.143
Hey, over here.

19:24.311 --> 19:26.472
- What's up, girl? What's your name?
- Virginia.

19:26.647 --> 19:28.342
- Virginia?
- Yeah.

19:31.986 --> 19:33.317
- Wayne, let's go.
- Hold up now.

19:33.487 --> 19:35.079
Wayne?

19:36.757 --> 19:39.487
Enough, let's go, Wayne.

19:40.027 --> 19:42.757
There you go. What's up, pretty girl?

19:46.267 --> 19:48.531
- Blast this fool.
- Gun!

19:57.244 --> 20:00.338
- Stay down.
- Wayne! Get in the car!

20:02.883 --> 20:05.351
- Get in the car.
- Get in the car, Wayne.

20:06.387 --> 20:08.355
- Get in the car.
- Get Barclay in the car.

20:08.756 --> 20:11.020
Come on, man. Let's go!

20:12.259 --> 20:13.624
- In the car.
- Who are you?

20:13.794 --> 20:15.318
- Get in the car.
- Wayne!

20:15.496 --> 20:17.225
Stay put.

20:30.644 --> 20:32.168
Damn.

20:41.522 --> 20:43.353
Bowden!

20:56.470 --> 20:57.732
Hey.

21:00.407 --> 21:01.772
Bowden?

21:02.943 --> 21:04.433
Bowden.

22:10.511 --> 22:13.105
I find it sadly ironic...

22:13.280 --> 22:15.612
that I am standing here today.

22:15.916 --> 22:18.077
Over the coffin...

22:18.719 --> 22:20.778
of Clarence Bowden.

22:22.823 --> 22:26.486
Because if not for his action in
Kandahar a couple of years ago...

22:26.660 --> 22:29.128
it would have been him...

22:29.296 --> 22:31.264
standing over mine.

22:33.901 --> 22:35.960
And I bet...

22:36.136 --> 22:39.230
there's probably a few others here...

22:40.307 --> 22:42.104
who can say the same.

22:48.749 --> 22:51.513
He served his country well...

22:52.720 --> 22:55.120
and took care of his friends.

22:57.157 --> 22:59.125
Goodbye, my friend.

23:00.961 --> 23:02.690
Goodbye.

23:02.863 --> 23:04.797
Present arms!

23:06.233 --> 23:08.133
Firing detail. Ready.

23:08.936 --> 23:10.699
Fire!

23:10.871 --> 23:12.395
Chamber.

23:12.573 --> 23:15.508
Ready. Fire!

23:16.410 --> 23:18.207
Ready. Fire!

23:20.881 --> 23:23.748
Ready. Fire!

23:55.349 --> 23:57.613
Anyway, guys.

23:57.785 --> 24:00.345
- You look good.
- Take care.

24:07.828 --> 24:09.887
Mister Sauvage?

24:10.197 --> 24:13.530
Mister Sauvage. Mister Sauvage.

24:14.601 --> 24:16.535
Can we offer you a ride?

24:18.972 --> 24:21.463
No, thanks. I would like to be alone.

24:22.609 --> 24:26.807
Wayne and I just wanted to
come over and offer our condolences.

24:28.048 --> 24:31.040
Yeah, you know, your brother
laid down his life for me.

24:31.318 --> 24:34.810
There's not too many folks I can
count on to do something like that.

24:35.389 --> 24:39.155
If it was up to me, I'd recommend
the both of y'all for a medal.

24:40.327 --> 24:42.818
Right now, I'm not feeling
much like a hero.

24:44.798 --> 24:48.097
Are there many more
out there like you, Mister Sauvage?

24:50.170 --> 24:53.503
- Like me?
- Professionals.

24:54.074 --> 24:55.666
People you can count on.

24:55.843 --> 24:57.538
Heads up.

24:58.612 --> 25:00.239
Is there a problem, officers?

25:00.547 --> 25:03.846
Mister Barclay, it is truly an honor, sir.

25:04.151 --> 25:06.915
Detective Teague. Violent Crimes Division.

25:08.222 --> 25:11.191
You are Philippe Sauvage,
formerly of the U.S. Army?

25:11.358 --> 25:13.849
- Yes, I am.
- I'm placing you under arrest.

25:14.027 --> 25:16.018
- What?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

25:16.196 --> 25:18.994
- Mind explaining what this is about?
- That nightclub incident.

25:19.166 --> 25:22.192
Violation of municipal weapons ordinances.

25:22.369 --> 25:24.599
Your people took his
testimony and released him.

25:24.771 --> 25:26.932
He claimed he was
licensed to carry that MP7.

25:27.107 --> 25:29.041
The one he killed those civilians with.

25:29.343 --> 25:31.538
In self-defense.

25:31.712 --> 25:33.942
Bowden said everything was taken care of.

25:34.114 --> 25:36.878
Well, it's a little late
to check that with him now, huh?

25:37.050 --> 25:38.347
Put him in the car.

25:38.519 --> 25:40.214
- Excuse me? What?
- This is stupid.

25:40.387 --> 25:42.787
This is bullshit.
How come you're not arresting...

25:42.956 --> 25:44.685
the man who put a hit on my brother?

25:45.159 --> 25:47.127
- Who might that be?
- Detective...

25:47.294 --> 25:49.228
you pour water on shit and call it gravy.

25:49.396 --> 25:51.523
My lawyers will contact
your dumbass department.

25:51.698 --> 25:54.030
- And I mean within the hour.
- You better believe it.

25:54.701 --> 25:58.034
Why don't you call them yourself.
Hey, better still...

25:58.805 --> 26:01.706
- call me.
- You bet your ass I will.

26:02.442 --> 26:04.273
Have a nice day.

26:15.589 --> 26:18.183
Hey, Simcoe, what's up?

26:19.860 --> 26:21.828
He's so fresh.

26:22.362 --> 26:24.262
You looking good.

26:25.866 --> 26:27.493
Yo.

26:27.734 --> 26:29.167
Ma'am.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.934
Gangsters. Gangsters. All right.

26:36.109 --> 26:37.736
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:37.911 --> 26:39.276
You know it. You go, girl.

26:39.446 --> 26:41.437
- Come back.
- What's up?

26:42.182 --> 26:46.585
Gentlemen, we Q-ing today. Y'all hungry?

26:47.721 --> 26:50.121
Mister Singletery,
about the other night, we kind of...

26:50.290 --> 26:52.724
Hey. Not now, motherfucker.

26:55.128 --> 26:56.789
Friends of yours?

26:57.231 --> 26:59.324
No, no. These are just the cleanup crew.

26:59.499 --> 27:01.364
That neglected to take out some garbage.

27:02.936 --> 27:04.836
Cleanup crew, huh?

27:06.240 --> 27:09.698
Uncle T, this wouldn't have anything
to do with the incident involving...

27:09.876 --> 27:11.639
Cynthia.

27:12.479 --> 27:13.946
Cynthia.

27:14.114 --> 27:15.945
Oh, come on down here, darling.

27:16.116 --> 27:17.743
Look at you.

27:17.918 --> 27:20.944
Have you met my sister's son?
The new Johnnie Cochrane?

27:21.121 --> 27:25.387
No. Hi. What's your name?

27:26.860 --> 27:29.954
Leonard, stop drooling. Listen,
why not fetch the young lady a drink?

27:30.364 --> 27:32.093
Get acquainted. Come on.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.963
While I take care of my very
special friends.

27:37.137 --> 27:38.627
You know...

27:38.805 --> 27:41.069
I'm thinking about law school too.

27:41.241 --> 27:42.868
Really?

27:51.285 --> 27:54.083
You sorry bitch-ass
motherfuckers had a mission.

27:54.254 --> 27:56.245
Yeah, with all due respect, Terrell...

27:56.423 --> 27:58.118
we never expected no motherfucker...

27:58.292 --> 28:00.522
with an Uzi to come at us.

28:00.961 --> 28:04.522
I don't recall asking your
dumb ass for an explanation.

28:04.698 --> 28:06.859
And it's Mister Singletery to you.

28:07.034 --> 28:09.502
Come on, hot dog, say something.

28:10.537 --> 28:13.335
Just like a bitch. Come on.

28:14.908 --> 28:17.342
Yeah, you straight, baby.

28:17.978 --> 28:20.276
Oh, my babies.

28:20.614 --> 28:22.878
Yeah? Yeah? Right.

28:23.050 --> 28:26.019
Look at you, Max.
Max, boy, gonna get you, huh?

28:26.186 --> 28:27.813
That's right.

28:28.455 --> 28:31.549
Yeah, oh, look at that.
Oh, my babies, you've missed Daddy?

28:31.725 --> 28:35.058
You've missed Daddy? Daddy's home.
Daddy's home, okay?

28:35.228 --> 28:36.661
That's right.

28:38.265 --> 28:41.257
Wayne Barclay is a bitch.

28:42.002 --> 28:46.029
And that motherfucker is still alive and
jeopardizing my business interests!

28:46.206 --> 28:48.299
And did I mention that I hate that bitch?

28:49.076 --> 28:51.374
Well, I hate that bitch.

28:51.678 --> 28:55.614
I paid a lot of money for y'all niggas
to take care of that problem, didn't I?

28:55.782 --> 28:57.477
Didn't I?

29:01.421 --> 29:03.912
I think the babies are still hungry, boss.

29:05.158 --> 29:07.752
Daddy's been away for a while.

29:08.161 --> 29:10.721
They ain't been fed right.

29:11.498 --> 29:13.159
Oh, shit.

29:15.769 --> 29:17.532
Yeah. Y'all like that?

29:27.381 --> 29:29.076
That's right. Yeah.

29:30.550 --> 29:32.882
This is for y'all, babies.
Yeah, it's for y'all.

29:33.053 --> 29:37.080
Equal portions all around.
Don't be playing no favorites.

29:38.024 --> 29:41.255
Now, I have many options before me.

29:41.428 --> 29:43.589
I could ask for a heartfelt apology.

29:43.764 --> 29:45.425
With the promise that this screwup...

29:45.599 --> 29:47.863
will never happen again, or...

29:48.034 --> 29:51.595
You know, I know this piece of ass
he be hitting. Named Lydia.

29:51.772 --> 29:54.434
- Lydia?
- I used to score her some smack...

29:54.608 --> 29:58.066
back when she was stringy.
The bitch owes me, right?

29:58.245 --> 29:59.906
- Spit it out.
- I'm saying, man...

30:00.080 --> 30:02.981
the next time Barclay
drops by for a booty call...

30:03.150 --> 30:05.880
we'll be waiting.
We'll bust a cap in his ass.

30:08.155 --> 30:10.180
Y'all like that?

30:13.126 --> 30:16.755
Ain't nothing tastier
like a fresh piece of raw liver.

30:18.999 --> 30:22.127
All right. We're going to go
with the Lydia plan.

30:22.302 --> 30:24.031
And for y'all sakes...

30:24.204 --> 30:27.935
you best hope that this bitch
puts out on a timely basis.

30:28.108 --> 30:30.770
A very timely basis.

30:33.413 --> 30:34.641
Thank you.

30:34.815 --> 30:37.340
Try to sort the rest of it
out by tonight, please.

30:37.517 --> 30:40.042
My brother wants this man on
payroll by tomorrow morning.

30:41.388 --> 30:43.379
Will do, Miss Barclay. Right away.

30:48.595 --> 30:50.654
You people don't mess around.

30:50.831 --> 30:53.095
I ain't got no time to mess around.

30:53.266 --> 30:57.259
We'll just make a quick stop by the
V.A. facility and pick up your things.

30:57.938 --> 31:00.873
- Pick up my things?
- Yeah. So you can move in with us.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.134
Don't worry. We've got plenty of room.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.405
Look, I appreciate you taking care of...

31:05.579 --> 31:07.308
Don't fight me on this, Mister Sauvage.

31:07.481 --> 31:10.279
We live there.
It's where Wayne's most vulnerable.

31:11.818 --> 31:13.911
Excuse me, but...

31:14.087 --> 31:15.486
did I miss something?

31:15.889 --> 31:19.222
The other night we hired you
and Mister Bowden for a trial run.

31:19.392 --> 31:21.326
You passed with flying colors.

31:21.495 --> 31:25.022
My brother would now like to make
that position permanent.

31:25.198 --> 31:27.792
And since Mister Bowden is...

31:27.968 --> 31:29.629
tragically no longer with us...

31:29.803 --> 31:32.670
we just assumed
that you'd be taking the position.

31:32.906 --> 31:34.737
You want me...

31:34.908 --> 31:37.638
to be on Mister Barclay's security team?

31:37.811 --> 31:39.278
No.

31:39.446 --> 31:41.346
We want you to head up the team.

31:44.017 --> 31:48.681
It's not easy for me to make
a snap decision like that right now.

31:48.855 --> 31:51.551
Look, if it's a monetary issue...

31:52.259 --> 31:54.090
It's not that.

31:54.528 --> 31:57.258
I just lost a very close friend.

31:57.430 --> 31:59.398
We're aware of that.

31:59.833 --> 32:02.700
It probably isn't the first time
you've lost a friend in combat.

32:03.570 --> 32:05.162
No.

32:05.338 --> 32:07.329
Mister Sauvage...

32:08.141 --> 32:10.905
what would Bowden have wanted you to do?

32:31.398 --> 32:33.025
Mister Sauvage...

32:33.199 --> 32:35.759
are you sure you wouldn't
rather come and stay with us?

32:35.936 --> 32:38.370
- Miss Barclay...
- Call me Tamara.

32:38.538 --> 32:41.530
Tamara, are you sure?

32:41.841 --> 32:43.274
I mean, about me?

32:43.443 --> 32:47.209
Look, I realize we didn't quite
get off on the right foot...

32:47.380 --> 32:50.816
Mister Sauvage, my fault entirely.

32:51.718 --> 32:53.709
And I apologize.

32:55.822 --> 32:57.949
Call me Philippe.

32:58.525 --> 33:00.152
All right, Philippe.

33:00.894 --> 33:05.228
Sometimes my overprotective
nature gets the better of me.

33:05.398 --> 33:07.229
Well, Tamara...

33:07.634 --> 33:09.898
you can delegate that to me now.

33:26.553 --> 33:29.021
Mister Barclay. Thanks for coming in.

33:29.522 --> 33:30.750
Appreciate the escort.

33:30.924 --> 33:34.519
Cuts traffic like nobody's business.
You think the mayor gonna be jealous?

33:34.694 --> 33:38.357
Until the perps who tried to ice you are
behind bars, we prefer to play it safe.

33:38.531 --> 33:41.830
This way, please. Gentlemen, just
stay here. This won't take long.

33:42.002 --> 33:45.563
- I'll go with Mister Barclay.
- No. You'll stay right here.

33:45.739 --> 33:48.867
This is police headquarters,
he's secure. Trust me.

33:49.042 --> 33:51.442
It's cool. I got it.

33:55.248 --> 33:57.842
I assume you brought me here
for some confidential scoop...

33:58.018 --> 34:00.782
on the illustrious Mister Singletery?

34:01.087 --> 34:02.748
Sit, please.

34:04.190 --> 34:06.715
Like maybe... I don't know....

34:06.893 --> 34:09.554
something about his impending arrest?

34:10.096 --> 34:13.395
I'm not supposed to tell anybody, but
you got the situation under control.

34:13.565 --> 34:17.195
Sorry, no. As far as I'm told,
he's been keeping his nose clean.

34:17.437 --> 34:19.462
Right. Right.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.902
It's Al-Qaeda trying to take me out.

34:22.074 --> 34:24.304
Bin Laden and them, right?

34:24.978 --> 34:28.311
Do they feed you people stupid-pills
around here or what?

34:28.547 --> 34:30.641
Why am I wasting my damn time...?

34:30.817 --> 34:32.284
Mister Barclay...

34:32.452 --> 34:34.476
take a look at these.

34:38.525 --> 34:42.688
I brought you in here to talk to you
about your new bodyguard.

34:42.862 --> 34:45.422
Sit down, please.
You need to listen to this.

34:50.737 --> 34:53.228
Phillipe Sauvage, developed some...

34:53.406 --> 34:56.375
well, lets just call them
psychological issues which...

34:56.543 --> 35:00.240
initially manifested in Afghanistan
and finally came to a head in Iraq.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.778
There was a massacre
of civilians in Mosel.

35:02.949 --> 35:04.610
Mostly children.

35:05.585 --> 35:08.816
The news services didn't get
the full story, but I did.

35:09.255 --> 35:10.882
Philippe Sauvage is the guy...

35:11.057 --> 35:14.458
who single-handedly massacred those kids.

35:14.728 --> 35:18.255
According to military psychologists,
he's a walking time bomb.

35:18.431 --> 35:21.457
And prior to his medical discharge,
he was under lock and key...

35:21.634 --> 35:25.195
at the psych ward at Walter Reed.
You wanna know why?

35:25.371 --> 35:29.398
The U.S. Army was afraid he was too
dangerous to let loose on the streets.

35:29.576 --> 35:32.204
Why are you telling me all this?

35:32.378 --> 35:34.278
Just trying to do you a solid, Wayne.

35:34.447 --> 35:38.406
Because you may not have realized
this, but I am one of your biggest fans.

35:40.620 --> 35:44.920
Listen, I know you probably
get asked this all the time...

35:46.426 --> 35:48.485
but could you possibly?

35:49.796 --> 35:51.559
You got a marker?

35:57.203 --> 35:59.330
This guy, Sauvage...

35:59.506 --> 36:01.940
he's gonna be responsible
for protecting you.

36:02.108 --> 36:04.201
Your family. Your sister.

36:04.744 --> 36:09.181
I wouldn't want it on my conscience if
something unfortunate was to happen.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.292
How's your cottage?

36:26.432 --> 36:30.459
My cottage.
I've seen a family of 10 living in less.

36:31.571 --> 36:35.166
You should have seen the places
where my brothers and I grew up.

36:35.608 --> 36:38.475
Your brothers? How many?

36:41.114 --> 36:42.809
Just one.

36:44.017 --> 36:45.985
You wanna see the rest of the house?

36:47.353 --> 36:48.786
Oh, yeah.

36:48.955 --> 36:50.946
I wonder what's keeping Wayne?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.766
Welcome to Wayne's world.

37:03.803 --> 37:08.240
- Would you like a drink?
- No. But thanks.

37:08.408 --> 37:13.038
Oh, come on. Just one.
You're not officially on duty yet.

37:13.213 --> 37:16.182
It's not that. I just shouldn't.

37:17.584 --> 37:20.553
I used to have a problem with that.

37:21.955 --> 37:25.391
- I understand. Sorry I asked.
- It's okay.

37:26.559 --> 37:28.550
So how many people will you
need on your team?

37:28.728 --> 37:30.355
I'm trying to work on a budget.

37:30.530 --> 37:35.263
Half a dozen. More or less.
I just finished making a few calls.

37:37.237 --> 37:41.765
All right, here you go.
Good old H2O. Can't argue with that.

37:42.842 --> 37:47.609
- To new partnerships.
- To new partnerships.

37:55.722 --> 37:58.919
- You play pool?
- I didn't play for a long time.

37:59.826 --> 38:01.885
Cool. Why don't we play a game?

38:03.463 --> 38:05.556
Let's see what you got.

38:07.500 --> 38:11.095
So, Philippe, do you have any family?

38:11.771 --> 38:13.363
Not really.

38:13.940 --> 38:16.306
Bowden and some of those guys
at the funeral...

38:16.476 --> 38:18.569
that's basically my family.

38:18.745 --> 38:23.239
Oh, thank you. You ever been married?

38:23.416 --> 38:25.407
Never could sit still long enough.

38:29.355 --> 38:32.882
- What about you?
- Oh, tried that one before.

38:33.059 --> 38:35.254
Now I'm married to my job.

38:36.195 --> 38:38.789
You think it's easy managing my brother?

38:38.965 --> 38:41.297
Long as I can remember...

38:41.467 --> 38:45.164
he's always been the spender,
and I've been the saver.

38:46.940 --> 38:49.602
He's the one who put me through college.

38:50.543 --> 38:55.105
Now my M.B.A what's keeping him
from pissing away all that money.

38:58.952 --> 39:00.010
Your shot.

39:04.590 --> 39:07.991
I remember watching some of his fights.

39:08.494 --> 39:14.364
He was very aggressive.
Always on the attack. Never let go.

39:14.834 --> 39:16.495
Well, while we're waiting for him....

39:26.479 --> 39:28.071
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Good.

39:28.247 --> 39:32.775
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's what
I'm talking about. Oh, yeah.

39:34.754 --> 39:38.155
Go, Barclay. Yeah. That's it.
Good. Do it, Wayne.

39:38.658 --> 39:40.148
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:42.195 --> 39:44.857
That's what I'm talking about.
Barclay! Barclay!

39:48.835 --> 39:50.666
Hey, Wayne.

39:53.006 --> 39:57.841
I was just filling in Mr. Sauvage
on some family history.

39:58.011 --> 39:59.808
- Family history?
- Yeah.

39:59.979 --> 40:02.140
Yeah. Good idea.

40:04.317 --> 40:06.717
Why don't you give him one of those DVDs?

40:06.886 --> 40:08.513
You can watch it at home.

40:08.988 --> 40:13.823
Wayne, I took the liberty of
moving him into the guest cottage.

40:13.993 --> 40:19.192
No sense of having him at a hotel
when we need him here 24l7, right?

40:20.800 --> 40:23.860
Hey, I didn't just hire her
because she's family.

40:24.804 --> 40:26.203
Sis is always thinking.

40:28.041 --> 40:30.373
She always one step ahead of the game.

40:30.543 --> 40:32.135
Yes, she is.

40:32.879 --> 40:36.178
- You're a lucky man.
- Excuse me.

40:38.151 --> 40:39.914
Mr. Barclay...

40:40.887 --> 40:43.822
can I get a few things straight
with you before I get started?

40:43.990 --> 40:46.151
Yeah, Tamara discuss salary with you?

40:46.325 --> 40:50.887
It's not that. Those guys you had
standing around at the funeral.

40:51.264 --> 40:53.129
Once I get my team in place...

40:53.299 --> 40:56.268
you can send them back to the gym
where you found them.

40:57.870 --> 41:01.101
No more amateurs.
If I'm going to run this show...

41:01.274 --> 41:03.606
I want the hardest of the hard-core.

41:05.244 --> 41:07.712
The Hard Corps it is, my man.

41:19.792 --> 41:21.851
This is where I learned to box.

41:22.695 --> 41:26.358
I wasn't more than 15
first time I rolled up in here.

41:29.368 --> 41:31.495
Now I own the place.

41:31.671 --> 41:34.606
I'm slowly bringing it
up to state of the art.

41:34.807 --> 41:38.436
Labor of love, though, really.
Hey, watch your head there.

41:39.345 --> 41:42.007
Financially, this place is a sinkhole.

41:46.986 --> 41:49.181
Hey, yo, Cujo!

41:49.355 --> 41:51.380
You're on your feet today, huh?

41:51.557 --> 41:53.422
Hey, what's up? You gonna take a bet?

41:54.160 --> 41:56.151
How you doing, man?

41:56.329 --> 41:59.059
- Go hammer some dude.
- What you doing, man?

42:08.841 --> 42:11.173
So we're just going to
spend the morning observing.

42:11.344 --> 42:14.780
Give you an opportunity to make
some notes on who you'd like to pick.

42:16.349 --> 42:19.876
- Who do I like to pick?
- Yeah. You know, for the team.

42:20.219 --> 42:22.915
We've got some good people here, Sauvage.

42:25.858 --> 42:29.851
- Are you okay, man?
- We need to talk.

42:30.730 --> 42:34.222
- Ain't that what we doing right now?
- In private.

42:34.667 --> 42:37.033
At the funeral, I was asked...

42:37.203 --> 42:40.172
if there were any more like me, correct?

42:40.339 --> 42:41.863
Yeah. Right. The Hard Corps.

42:42.041 --> 42:44.942
Ain't nothing changed.
You still bringing in your people.

42:45.111 --> 42:46.874
But they're working with some of mine.

42:47.246 --> 42:48.873
That was not the deal.

42:50.917 --> 42:54.910
All right, look, you get
this shit straight. I write the checks.

42:55.087 --> 42:57.715
I'll decide what the deal is gonna be.

42:57.890 --> 43:02.190
I guess you do. And you've
just decided. I won't be part of it.

43:02.628 --> 43:05.096
No, wait, wait, wait, come on.
Wait, wait. Hang on.

43:05.264 --> 43:07.494
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute.
- Mullins, move.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.464
Wayne knows these people.

43:09.635 --> 43:12.604
Known some of them for years.
He trusts them.

43:13.573 --> 43:18.340
How can I do my job and babysit
amateurs at the same time?

43:18.511 --> 43:20.672
Come on.

43:20.846 --> 43:23.337
Hey, don't tell me there wasn't
no time in your life...

43:23.516 --> 43:25.575
when you weren't nothing
but an amateur too.

43:25.751 --> 43:29.209
I know I was the first time
I walked in this gym.

43:29.655 --> 43:32.021
But someone saw a potential in me.

43:32.191 --> 43:35.126
Ain't no reason you can't do the same
with some of my people.

43:40.766 --> 43:42.461
Hey, Cujo.

43:43.169 --> 43:45.763
All right, guys. That's good.
That's enough.

43:45.938 --> 43:47.599
Gino. Kim.

43:58.551 --> 43:59.950
All right, Kim.

44:02.121 --> 44:06.490
- Who's that guy?
- That's Kim. Black belt, tae kwon do.

44:08.294 --> 44:11.957
Why wasn't this guy on
the security team at the club?

44:12.131 --> 44:15.157
- Didn't blend?
- His size.

44:15.935 --> 44:17.732
You know, sometimes it's good.

44:17.903 --> 44:21.236
The bad guys may not know
he's your bodyguard.

44:28.180 --> 44:32.742
Yeah. What? Excuse me.

44:32.918 --> 44:36.786
Tell the inspectors to take their codes,
stick them where the sun don't shine.

44:44.463 --> 44:47.796
I'm gonna wait outside.
I've got a friend who came in town.

44:47.967 --> 44:49.764
I want to make sure he find his way here.

44:49.935 --> 44:51.766
Should I just have her wait, or...?

44:51.937 --> 44:55.964
No, it's okay. I've got enough
headaches without a girl in my team.

44:56.542 --> 44:58.009
Sorry.

44:59.645 --> 45:02.546
Yo, man. What, we're tough enough
to go to Iraq...

45:02.715 --> 45:05.206
but back home's a different story?

45:09.889 --> 45:13.552
This is not a game. I need bodyguards.

45:14.960 --> 45:18.123
Are you ready to take a bullet
for Mr. Barclay?

45:20.333 --> 45:22.961
Are you? And you guys?

45:24.937 --> 45:29.397
All of you here. Any of you?

45:32.745 --> 45:34.212
Just give me a chance.

45:35.715 --> 45:39.048
Come on, Sauvage. Give her a shot.

45:42.555 --> 45:44.420
She's for real.

45:50.563 --> 45:55.091
- Show us what you got, soldier.
- All right, Sauvage. Here we go, man.

45:55.634 --> 45:57.966
- Come on.
- Watch out for that left hook.

46:05.845 --> 46:07.437
There you go.

46:17.022 --> 46:18.284
Look out. Look out.

46:25.965 --> 46:28.593
Go ahead, girl. There you go.
There you go.

46:33.706 --> 46:35.970
Hey, Sauvage. Pretty good, huh?

46:40.880 --> 46:43.542
- You're a candidate.
- I'm a what?

46:43.716 --> 46:47.914
A candidate. You will start basic
training tomorrow as a bodyguard.

46:50.790 --> 46:55.318
Oh, meet one of your drill instructors.
Sergeant Casey Bledsoe.

46:55.494 --> 46:56.791
Howdy.

46:57.663 --> 47:01.155
Hey, Sauvage, you didn't tell me
Roy Rogers was part of the deal.

47:02.902 --> 47:05.894
I brought along some camouflage, sir.

47:08.474 --> 47:09.907
Better?

47:16.582 --> 47:18.243
Dear, God.

47:34.033 --> 47:36.593
Don't even tell me you're tired.

47:37.803 --> 47:39.862
Come on inside. We've got more to do.

47:50.616 --> 47:52.277
Hey, hey, hey. Watch the suit.

47:53.452 --> 47:56.785
- What's going on here?
- And you call this protection?

47:56.956 --> 47:59.447
It may not be pretty.
You may get roughed up a bit.

48:00.159 --> 48:02.957
- But you'll be alive.
- Yeah, no shit.

48:03.128 --> 48:08.156
- Right, boss?
- That's right, Casey. Do it again.

48:11.337 --> 48:14.329
- No, no, no. Not like that. Left arm up.
- Okay.

48:14.507 --> 48:16.941
Now, don't try to get too fancy.

48:17.109 --> 48:19.407
No holding your weapon like this: Okay?

48:19.578 --> 48:21.068
- Yeah.
- You may come across...

48:21.247 --> 48:24.614
some people out there who do.
They'll miss.

48:24.783 --> 48:26.683
- I won't.
- That's right.

48:26.852 --> 48:30.583
Now, put the clip, as you know...

48:30.756 --> 48:34.351
chambering, as you know. Take your target.

48:34.727 --> 48:40.495
Position of the feet.
Remember? Stable, strong. Breathe.

48:40.866 --> 48:42.697
Relax and shoot.

48:47.206 --> 48:51.768
Damn. That is good shooting.

48:52.912 --> 48:54.504
Your turn.

48:55.180 --> 48:58.445
Mr. Sauvage, did you kill a lot of people?

49:07.092 --> 49:09.083
- What's up on the roof?
- Look out.

49:14.099 --> 49:15.896
I got it.

49:17.069 --> 49:18.798
Clear.

49:29.815 --> 49:31.806
Mr. Sauvage?

49:35.020 --> 49:36.351
- Mr.Sauvage?
- Yeah.

49:36.522 --> 49:40.424
- You okay?
- It's your turn.

49:41.927 --> 49:43.656
- Take the gun.
- Okay.

49:45.030 --> 49:47.555
And good. Relax.

49:55.774 --> 49:57.969
At ease, soldier.

50:01.347 --> 50:04.942
Sometimes I like to
sit out here at night...

50:05.250 --> 50:09.050
look at the stars. Eases my mind.

50:12.891 --> 50:16.122
Oh, here you go.

50:17.663 --> 50:19.358
Good old H2O.

50:19.798 --> 50:21.288
Just like you like it, right?

50:21.467 --> 50:23.298
Right. And yours?

50:23.469 --> 50:25.960
We've instituted
a new beverage policy, sir:

50:26.138 --> 50:28.470
Don't ask, don't tell.

50:36.448 --> 50:39.440
- Mind if I get a bit nosy?
- No, go ahead.

50:40.019 --> 50:42.510
Casey mentioned something about kids.

50:46.825 --> 50:48.383
That was in Iraq.

50:49.662 --> 50:53.462
Casey and I were
tracking down some terrorists.

50:53.632 --> 50:56.032
Then...

50:57.069 --> 50:59.367
one of them got inside a school...

51:04.443 --> 51:06.035
And....

51:07.246 --> 51:10.181
It's cloudy tonight.

51:10.582 --> 51:13.312
There's no stars. Right?

51:16.288 --> 51:18.984
I'm worried about tomorrow, Philippe.

51:19.158 --> 51:21.456
Sports complex opening.

51:21.627 --> 51:24.926
The mayor, and there'll be
a lot of people.

51:27.633 --> 51:31.228
- Are you sure that we're ready?
- Not exactly.

51:32.604 --> 51:36.665
But I'm still waiting for
a few of my guys to show up.

51:37.710 --> 51:42.477
Look, let me do the worrying. Okay?

51:43.382 --> 51:47.546
- I'll try.
- And try to sleep

51:49.154 --> 51:50.553
That an order, colonel?

51:52.057 --> 51:53.922
That's an order.

52:07.106 --> 52:08.903
Good night, Tamara.

52:10.743 --> 52:12.176
Good night.

52:46.979 --> 52:49.914
Oh, damn, man. What the f...?

52:50.082 --> 52:53.540
- Hey, this ain't no tackle football.
- No, it's not.

52:53.719 --> 52:55.243
What the f...?

52:56.488 --> 52:59.514
You mind telling me why you're
sneaking around like that?

52:59.691 --> 53:03.024
Oh, me sneaking? Yeah, talk about
the pot calling the kettle black.

53:03.195 --> 53:06.221
- What are you talking about?
- Man, we'll discuss that later.

53:06.398 --> 53:08.332
Right now, I'm going for a little drive.

53:08.500 --> 53:12.368
Hey. A drive? This time of night?

53:12.538 --> 53:16.599
Yeah, with Cujo, one of your trainees.
He's meeting me down the street.

53:18.811 --> 53:20.278
Then I'm riding shotgun.

53:20.612 --> 53:22.910
Look, I just told you.
I got a bodyguard. All right?

53:23.081 --> 53:26.517
- You been training the man yourself.
- He's not ready to fly solo.

53:26.685 --> 53:28.312
None of them are.

53:28.921 --> 53:32.084
All right, man, look,
I got a private rendezvous...

53:32.257 --> 53:35.283
with a certain young lady. You feel me?

53:35.460 --> 53:37.655
Any reason she can't come here?

53:39.264 --> 53:42.199
Look, it's a long story.
Sis thinks Lydia's bad for my image.

53:42.367 --> 53:44.335
- Oh.
- But this little freak...

53:45.137 --> 53:48.402
she's hot tonight, man.
You know? Booty call, eh?

53:48.574 --> 53:50.508
So can I handle my business?
Can I...? Yeah?

53:50.676 --> 53:53.270
I ride shotgun or you don't leave.

53:53.445 --> 53:55.675
Unless you want those cops to go with you.

53:55.848 --> 53:59.011
If I wanted them, would I be climbing
over my own goddamn fence?

54:03.055 --> 54:05.853
You're getting to be one royal
pain in the ass, you know that?

54:06.024 --> 54:09.323
Yeah. It's what you pay me for. Sir.

54:27.613 --> 54:29.046
Are you feeling this?

54:30.115 --> 54:32.345
Maybe if I understood
what they were saying...

54:32.517 --> 54:36.715
besides, "Bitch, ho, motherfucker."

54:40.225 --> 54:43.592
Well, why don't you help me
understand this?

54:44.329 --> 54:46.729
What's this sneaking around
between you and my sister?

54:47.199 --> 54:49.099
- What?
- Yeah, you heard me.

54:49.268 --> 54:52.533
Cocktails in the moonlight,
all that shit. I got eyes, man.

54:52.704 --> 54:55.901
First of all, no one's sneaking around.

54:56.341 --> 54:59.640
And I'm the one who's
supposed to keep an eye on you.

55:00.612 --> 55:04.742
- Tell me she didn't kiss you tonight.
- You call that a kiss?

55:04.917 --> 55:07.477
It was a peck on the cheek.

55:08.153 --> 55:10.917
Yeah, next comes poking the coochie.

55:11.223 --> 55:13.123
Hey, man, you know that's how it starts.

55:13.292 --> 55:17.194
Hey, that shit ain't funny, man.
That's my sister.

55:19.331 --> 55:23.062
Sir, you are my commanding officer.

55:23.235 --> 55:25.260
She's the X O.

55:25.437 --> 55:29.498
I don't fraternize
with my superiors, okay?

55:29.675 --> 55:32.007
Good. Just keep it that way.

55:34.746 --> 55:37.647
Do you wanna wipe
that smile off your face, soldier?

55:38.884 --> 55:40.442
Yes, sir.

55:46.625 --> 55:48.252
Gotta go.

55:50.128 --> 55:51.459
He's here.

55:52.731 --> 55:56.223
Not now, fool. Get his autograph
on your own damn time.

55:56.401 --> 55:57.663
Punk.

56:00.505 --> 56:03.338
Hey, hey. That is as far
as you need to go.

56:03.709 --> 56:05.336
There's an alley behind the house.

56:05.844 --> 56:07.311
I need to check it out.

56:08.547 --> 56:10.674
No, what you need is some hot...

56:10.849 --> 56:14.182
wild, naked, scandalous ass
of your own. That's what you need.

56:14.786 --> 56:17.311
Not with my sister,
but that's what you need.

56:17.489 --> 56:20.219
I thought we resolved this issue.

56:21.493 --> 56:26.692
Seriously, man, it would do wonders
for this uptight attitude you've got.

56:29.067 --> 56:30.728
Yes, so I've been told.

56:31.703 --> 56:33.898
You know what? I'm gonna talk to Lydia.

56:34.639 --> 56:36.698
See if she can't
hook you up with a friend.

56:37.709 --> 56:39.336
Won't be necessary.

56:39.511 --> 56:42.844
She's got some hot friends, Sauvage.
Think about it.

56:58.196 --> 57:00.357
What's wrong, baby?

57:01.266 --> 57:04.201
You know, you haven't
been to see me in a while.

57:04.736 --> 57:08.331
Yeah, I've been busy.

57:18.750 --> 57:21.412
Tamara still doesn't like me.

57:21.653 --> 57:23.245
Is that it?

57:23.422 --> 57:27.085
She does not dictate where I go
or who I see, if that's what you mean.

57:29.795 --> 57:31.695
She isn't out there, is she?

57:31.863 --> 57:33.194
Hell, no.

57:33.365 --> 57:35.629
Got me this new bodyguard.

57:36.968 --> 57:39.903
Takes his job a little too serious.

57:44.076 --> 57:48.137
Well, I'm your bodyguard
in the bedroom, baby.

57:48.647 --> 57:52.913
And I'm about to get real serious.

58:21.847 --> 58:24.475
Oh, shit.

59:16.101 --> 59:19.434
All right. Now, that punk
in front of the crib...

59:19.604 --> 59:21.902
probably one of Barclay's boys.

59:22.073 --> 59:24.906
You blaze that fool if he creeps up
toward the house, all right?

59:25.076 --> 59:27.340
All right, man.
Think he brought anyone else?

59:27.512 --> 59:30.572
Ain't seen that bitch-ass bodyguard,
ain't seen no cops.

59:30.749 --> 59:32.740
So let's do this shit.

59:51.136 --> 59:53.127
- Mr. Sauvage.
- Call Casey.

59:53.305 --> 59:55.205
Tell him to come right over here.

59:55.507 --> 59:58.772
- You stay inside the car.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:58.944 --> 01:00:00.707
Start to use your COMSET.

01:00:00.879 --> 01:00:03.006
Right, right, right. Okay.

01:00:18.129 --> 01:00:21.496
- Going so soon, baby?
- Yeah.

01:00:22.033 --> 01:00:25.230
I've got this sports complex thing
tomorrow, you know.

01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:30.333
But I thought you were gonna
spend the night with me.

01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:33.607
I would. I would if I could.

01:00:33.778 --> 01:00:37.077
Look, the mayor's gonna be there
and everything, you know. I gotta go.

01:00:37.249 --> 01:00:38.841
Next time.

01:00:40.252 --> 01:00:43.312
Yo, Lydia, what's up, baby? High Dog.

01:00:43.488 --> 01:00:45.422
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Who's this?

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.455
Some fool that wants your autograph.

01:00:47.626 --> 01:00:49.423
I'm gonna autograph my fist in his face.

01:00:49.928 --> 01:00:51.156
- Baby, wait!
- Back it up!

01:00:51.329 --> 01:00:53.490
- Oh, shit!
- Stupid bitch.

01:00:53.665 --> 01:00:55.929
- Take it easy, man.
- Don't be no hero, Barclay.

01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:58.661
- Get in there, motherfucker!
- Take it easy, all right?

01:00:58.837 --> 01:01:00.464
Keep going!

01:01:02.274 --> 01:01:03.605
All right.

01:01:03.775 --> 01:01:06.744
If y'all know any prayers,
I suggest you say them now.

01:01:14.119 --> 01:01:16.246
Hand over the gun, bitch.

01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:32.094
You mother...!

01:01:52.657 --> 01:01:54.056
You fucking rat bastard.

01:02:09.774 --> 01:02:13.505
Who sent you, huh?
That motherfucker Terrell?

01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:15.808
Talk, you piece of shit!

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.880
I'll make the bitch talk.

01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:19.539
Goddamn, baby! Shit!

01:02:22.821 --> 01:02:25.585
Get the fuck up.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:02:28.893 --> 01:02:31.225
Okay, okay. You were right.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.863
Get the fuck over there.

01:02:34.032 --> 01:02:35.727
Get the fuck down.

01:02:39.771 --> 01:02:41.398
Look what I found outside.

01:02:41.573 --> 01:02:43.564
Ain't it past your bedtime, son?

01:02:45.043 --> 01:02:48.342
- Good work, Cujo.
- Your mama know you're out this late?

01:02:51.883 --> 01:02:53.908
I missed the party, huh?

01:02:59.424 --> 01:03:01.358
- Are we taking POW's?
- For what?

01:03:02.727 --> 01:03:06.561
- Gonna be out on bail in the morning.
- I say execute them.

01:03:07.198 --> 01:03:09.393
- Done.
- Oh, no. Cujo, no.

01:03:09.567 --> 01:03:11.626
Oh, come one, just give me one. Just one.

01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:13.600
Just leave them for the cops.

01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:19.202
This might be enough evidence
to prove Terrell violated his parole.

01:03:19.377 --> 01:03:21.504
Ain't gonna matter anyhow.

01:03:22.447 --> 01:03:25.280
You're a dead man, Barclay. Yeah.

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.483
And you and you....

01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:31.948
Especially you, bitch.

01:03:32.123 --> 01:03:34.114
- Bitch?
- Hey, baby.

01:03:34.292 --> 01:03:36.658
- What?
- Lydia. Come on, now.

01:03:39.898 --> 01:03:42.264
Want a piece of me too, punk?

01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:46.136
- You got a...? A sister?
- Look, this is jacked.

01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:50.735
I've got that sports center complex
opening in less than six hours.

01:03:50.909 --> 01:03:54.037
Wait, wait. Hold on.
Are you going to that?

01:03:54.212 --> 01:03:56.942
Yeah. The mayor's gonna be there.

01:03:57.115 --> 01:03:59.583
Yes, and maybe another hit team.

01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:02.743
Come on, man.
When are you going to start listening?

01:04:03.188 --> 01:04:04.849
The team is not ready.

01:04:06.157 --> 01:04:09.991
Tonight, you were this close, man.
This close of getting whacked.

01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:12.994
Yeah. And you came through for me solid.

01:04:13.164 --> 01:04:15.792
Man, you... You're earning
your money, my man.

01:04:15.967 --> 01:04:18.162
And I expect you
to keep on doing the same.

01:04:18.336 --> 01:04:20.099
At the opening.

01:04:21.339 --> 01:04:22.897
Let's go.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:26.803
Not a word of this shit to my sister.

01:04:26.978 --> 01:04:30.607
Tamara hears about this,
she'll go bananas, okay?

01:04:30.782 --> 01:04:34.274
- You understand me, right, Sauvage?
- Yes, I do.

01:04:35.787 --> 01:04:38.847
You're a good man. Good man.

01:04:47.699 --> 01:04:50.668
All right, let's go. Pick it up.

01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:13.589
This sucks.

01:05:13.758 --> 01:05:15.191
No shit.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.120
I'm choking on this collar.

01:05:18.296 --> 01:05:20.856
I mean the entire setup.

01:05:21.332 --> 01:05:22.594
Those school kids.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:27.603
Phil.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.370
Okay, I'm obsessing again.

01:05:31.543 --> 01:05:35.104
But all it takes is one nut case
to shoot in their direction.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.373
Who are we here to protect?

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:41.284
I know. I know. I fucking hate this.

01:05:46.558 --> 01:05:48.958
- Hey, big mo.
- Looks like we've got a packed house.

01:05:49.127 --> 01:05:51.425
- Wait.
- Five-minute warning on the mayor.

01:05:51.596 --> 01:05:53.188
Here you go.

01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:55.628
Showtime.

01:05:57.669 --> 01:06:01.070
Mr. Barclay, I've got to say something,
you may not want to hear it.

01:06:01.239 --> 01:06:02.729
Then don't say it.

01:06:02.907 --> 01:06:06.468
I'm in a great mood, Sauvage, don't
even think about bringing me down.

01:06:07.445 --> 01:06:09.037
You can tell it to me, Philippe.

01:06:10.014 --> 01:06:12.346
Tamara, I'd feel much better
if you went out there...

01:06:12.517 --> 01:06:14.985
and made that speech
instead of your brother.

01:06:15.954 --> 01:06:17.922
Yeah. Right, yeah.

01:06:18.089 --> 01:06:19.954
Maybe I should have sent
sis in the ring...

01:06:20.124 --> 01:06:22.217
when I had that exhibition fight
with Tyson.

01:06:22.393 --> 01:06:24.623
- Wayne.
- I'm starting to believe those folks...

01:06:24.796 --> 01:06:27.162
who've been calling you a nut case.

01:06:28.666 --> 01:06:31.567
And what folks might those be?

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:35.138
- What did I just tell you about...?
- Four-minute warning.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.940
Anyone about to make a speech,
I'd advise they use the restroom.

01:06:41.346 --> 01:06:43.280
Talk to your boy.

01:06:43.982 --> 01:06:46.416
I say I ain't got time for this.

01:06:48.653 --> 01:06:50.553
What the fuck is he talking about?

01:06:50.722 --> 01:06:52.781
We'll talk about it
in a more appropriate time.

01:06:52.957 --> 01:06:54.481
After the ceremony.

01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:57.789
And know this:

01:06:57.962 --> 01:07:01.659
I would gladly go out there and give
the speech myself if he'd let me.

01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:03.266
I warned you he was hardheaded.

01:07:03.768 --> 01:07:07.761
I was expecting cement
but not titanium steel.

01:07:07.939 --> 01:07:11.170
Philippe, Wayne's a good man.
He means well.

01:07:11.342 --> 01:07:13.776
Just don't let anything happen to him.

01:07:14.579 --> 01:07:16.979
I don't know if I could
go through that again.

01:07:27.325 --> 01:07:28.656
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mayor, over here.

01:07:28.826 --> 01:07:30.555
Mr. Mayor, can you smile over here?

01:07:30.895 --> 01:07:32.556
Any time for an interview?

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.288
- Mr. Mayor?
- Can we get a statement?

01:07:34.465 --> 01:07:35.727
Mr. Mayor, please.

01:07:45.543 --> 01:07:48.876
- Okay, let's do this.
- You're gonna be great, bro.

01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:17.671
Yo, yo! The champ's here!

01:08:24.348 --> 01:08:26.509
- Hey, champ.
- What's up? What's up?

01:08:26.684 --> 01:08:29.983
- Thank you, thank you.
- Mr. Barclay, can I get an autograph?

01:08:30.154 --> 01:08:33.282
Hey, man what the hell? Back off!
I just want an autograph, man.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:36.256
I just want an autograph, man.

01:08:38.496 --> 01:08:41.590
Hey, what's up? Thank you.
Thank you for coming out.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.600
Hey, thank you. What's up, bro?

01:08:53.144 --> 01:08:55.135
- Barclay for mayor!
- There he is, right there.

01:08:57.014 --> 01:08:58.572
Thank you.

01:09:00.283 --> 01:09:01.615
What's happening, Mr. Mayor?

01:09:08.059 --> 01:09:10.653
Nice to see you, Tamara. Please sit down.

01:09:15.466 --> 01:09:16.591
Barclay for president!

01:09:19.537 --> 01:09:23.473
I believe I heard a couple of you
shouting, "Barclay for mayor."

01:09:26.778 --> 01:09:30.407
I wouldn't put anything past this man,
this former heavyweight champion...

01:09:30.581 --> 01:09:34.483
who's moved on to become
a successful businessman...

01:09:34.652 --> 01:09:36.279
a prodigious builder...

01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:38.350
a respected leader...

01:09:38.523 --> 01:09:40.081
and a pillar of strength...

01:09:40.258 --> 01:09:43.750
in a community that desperately
needs positive role models.

01:09:43.928 --> 01:09:45.657
- Amen.
- But please...

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.765
don't give him any ideas, folks.

01:09:48.933 --> 01:09:52.334
This is one man I wouldn't wanna
have to face in any kind of arena.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:56.535
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Wayne Barclay.

01:10:04.615 --> 01:10:06.583
Barclay!

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.956
- Thank you.
- Barclay! Barclay! Barclay!

01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:25.727
Barclay! Barclay! Barclay!

01:10:25.903 --> 01:10:27.370
Barclay! Barclay!

01:10:27.538 --> 01:10:29.369
- Barclay!
- I spotted a target.

01:10:29.774 --> 01:10:32.368
Black, 6-foot-4.

01:10:32.543 --> 01:10:35.239
Almost directly in front of the podium.

01:10:39.684 --> 01:10:41.151
Mohawk, scar on his face?

01:10:41.786 --> 01:10:43.014
That's the one.

01:10:45.389 --> 01:10:49.883
Kim and Cujo, try to get to this guy
as soon as possible.

01:10:54.232 --> 01:10:56.166
All right, Big Wayne!

01:10:56.634 --> 01:10:59.660
You know, a long time ago...

01:11:01.505 --> 01:11:03.564
I used to play on these streets.

01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:06.407
Back then, they weren't much to look at.

01:11:06.978 --> 01:11:09.674
I learned to fight on these streets.

01:11:11.382 --> 01:11:13.942
Today, I don't see as much fighting.

01:11:14.919 --> 01:11:17.752
Today, I'm beginning to see progress.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.889
Today, a dream has come true for me...

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.255
and for this community.

01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:30.223
Gun!

01:11:31.602 --> 01:11:33.194
Move!

01:11:43.748 --> 01:11:45.807
Let go my arm, man! Let go of my arm.

01:12:00.698 --> 01:12:03.223
- Get your ass up.
- What do you got?

01:12:03.634 --> 01:12:05.192
We saw him going for a gun, man.

01:12:06.103 --> 01:12:09.766
- What the hell just happened?
- I'll explain later. In a safe place.

01:12:10.308 --> 01:12:12.401
- This is bullshit.
- Hey, you're bullshit.

01:12:14.145 --> 01:12:15.635
You mean this?

01:12:15.813 --> 01:12:19.305
Damn. You made me miss a call, yo.

01:12:22.386 --> 01:12:23.683
It was from my Mom too.

01:12:24.989 --> 01:12:27.014
I should have you morons locked up.

01:12:27.325 --> 01:12:29.850
Every last one of you.

01:12:30.795 --> 01:12:34.595
A sense of calm has settled in, but
moments ago, a near riot erupted...

01:12:34.765 --> 01:12:37.598
when bodyguards for former
heavyweight champ Wayne Barclay...

01:12:37.768 --> 01:12:40.965
thought they'd spotted a man with a gun.

01:12:44.008 --> 01:12:46.442
I have with me Lieutenant Teague
of the Metro Police.

01:12:46.844 --> 01:12:48.072
Oh, boy.

01:12:48.245 --> 01:12:51.339
Would you describe to us what the
gentleman was actually reaching for?

01:12:51.515 --> 01:12:54.279
Yes, it was a cellular phone.

01:12:54.518 --> 01:12:56.247
I have a gentleman who was manhandled...

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.547
by this group of amateurish
security guards.

01:12:58.723 --> 01:13:02.659
He plans to file a lawsuit
against Mr. Barclay for assault...

01:13:02.827 --> 01:13:05.489
and possibly for a violation
of his civil rights.

01:13:11.102 --> 01:13:14.230
- You watching it on TV?
- Yeah.

01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:20.836
Nothing we could do, Terrell.

01:13:21.012 --> 01:13:22.912
Them motherfuckers
were on our ass all day.

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:24.980
Hell yeah, let him know, man.

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:27.846
Switch to Plan B.

01:13:30.888 --> 01:13:32.879
All right, gangsters...

01:13:33.491 --> 01:13:34.753
move to Plan B.

01:13:34.925 --> 01:13:37.052
What is Plan B?

01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:42.899
Let me give you some advice.

01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:47.265
You wanna shit with the big dogs,
stop pissing with the puppies.

01:13:47.438 --> 01:13:49.906
Any particular reason why
Mr. Barclay's bodyguards...

01:13:50.074 --> 01:13:51.302
might have been so jumpy?

01:13:51.609 --> 01:13:54.669
The gentleman they assaulted is
African-American, so it's possible...

01:13:54.845 --> 01:13:58.042
that their overzealousness
was racially motivated.

01:13:58.516 --> 01:14:00.040
- Unbelievable.
- Please.

01:14:00.351 --> 01:14:03.411
This guy is so full of shit his eyeballs
are starting to turn brown.

01:14:03.587 --> 01:14:07.079
Yeah, well, brown eyes pretty much
called the ball game on this one.

01:14:07.258 --> 01:14:10.591
In five minutes, I went from
Mayor Barclay to Captain Kangaroo!

01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:13.821
I might as well have been onstage
tap-dancing and singing Mammy.

01:14:13.998 --> 01:14:15.260
Hold up, hold up, Wayne.

01:14:15.433 --> 01:14:17.731
This man's been busting his ass
to protect you.

01:14:17.902 --> 01:14:20.530
- And I'm trying to protect you.
- Protect me from what?

01:14:21.872 --> 01:14:24.170
- Why don't you go and ask him?
- Ask him what?

01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:28.072
You ask him why the Army had his ass
locked up in the psychiatric hospital.

01:14:28.245 --> 01:14:29.473
- What?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:31.376
Why don't you tell her that, huh?

01:14:31.549 --> 01:14:33.949
- What are you talking about?
- Tell her that shit.

01:14:34.118 --> 01:14:35.779
The man's a killer. I'll be damned...

01:14:35.953 --> 01:14:39.980
if I'm gonna let some psychotic,
schitzo freak hit on my sister.

01:14:40.157 --> 01:14:41.715
Wayne...

01:14:43.561 --> 01:14:45.995
who's acting psychotic here?

01:14:54.305 --> 01:14:57.399
- Jessie, stay with her.
- You got it.

01:14:59.009 --> 01:15:02.069
Barclay, I quit.

01:15:02.246 --> 01:15:04.305
And this time it's final.

01:15:04.982 --> 01:15:06.745
Do you see me crying?

01:15:07.017 --> 01:15:10.976
You and I need to talk about
my severance package.

01:15:11.489 --> 01:15:12.820
Why don't you sever this?

01:15:16.827 --> 01:15:19.091
You don't seem to understand.

01:15:19.263 --> 01:15:21.288
I want you to name a place...

01:15:21.599 --> 01:15:24.966
and make sure to bring some
ice packs and some painkillers.

01:15:25.136 --> 01:15:26.535
Because it's going to hurt.

01:15:26.704 --> 01:15:29.366
Oh, you want to take it there. Good.

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.804
My gym, 30 minutes.

01:15:31.976 --> 01:15:35.207
And if I was you, I'd prepare
to start eating dinner out of a straw.

01:15:35.679 --> 01:15:37.169
Sure.

01:15:51.695 --> 01:15:53.686
Casey, you wait here.

01:15:53.864 --> 01:15:55.229
This won't take long.

01:16:01.405 --> 01:16:06.536
So, any of you guys bring a ice pack
and some painkillers?

01:16:09.747 --> 01:16:13.239
My Benjamin Franklin says your boy is
the one who's gonna be needing it.

01:16:27.198 --> 01:16:28.665
Let's go.

01:16:28.832 --> 01:16:30.857
Come on, little man. Show me what you got.

01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:34.297
In the ring?

01:16:35.973 --> 01:16:37.235
You don't get it, do you?

01:16:39.043 --> 01:16:40.738
I'm not looking for a fair fight.

01:16:42.012 --> 01:16:43.877
Any way you want it.

01:16:47.585 --> 01:16:49.280
Them results are gonna be the same.

01:16:49.887 --> 01:16:51.582
What you got?

01:17:03.667 --> 01:17:06.363
This is gonna be a better workout
then I expected.

01:17:15.946 --> 01:17:17.846
Now, who has been talking shit about me?

01:17:20.551 --> 01:17:24.954
The only shit is what you been
talking about yourself.

01:17:25.122 --> 01:17:27.556
First you got my sister believing it.

01:17:28.192 --> 01:17:31.218
And then me. And now
the shit's about to hit the fan.

01:17:37.635 --> 01:17:40.103
Yeah. You feel that?

01:17:41.238 --> 01:17:43.001
You just stepped into it with the champ.

01:17:43.173 --> 01:17:45.664
You about to learn why they call me that.

01:17:47.011 --> 01:17:48.672
What you got?

01:17:53.017 --> 01:17:54.917
You know, my back is here.

01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:00.520
You feel that? Yeah.

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:10.963
Oh, yeah. Good.

01:19:52.236 --> 01:19:55.603
Phil. Phil, we got a problem.

01:19:57.608 --> 01:19:59.098
Mullins called.

01:19:59.276 --> 01:20:02.734
- Jessie's in the hospital.
- Said she's been shot up pretty bad.

01:20:02.913 --> 01:20:05.473
- What?
- Jessie. She's been shot.

01:20:05.649 --> 01:20:07.480
- By who?
- That's all we know.

01:20:08.886 --> 01:20:10.114
What about my sister?

01:20:13.624 --> 01:20:15.615
Wasn't Jessie supposed
to be following Tamara?

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:21.961
Paramedics brought her here unconscious...

01:20:22.132 --> 01:20:24.566
and with three gunshot wounds.

01:20:24.735 --> 01:20:28.193
Whoever did this
probably left her for dead.

01:20:28.372 --> 01:20:29.634
You've got five minutes.

01:20:29.807 --> 01:20:31.274
She needs to rest.

01:20:34.111 --> 01:20:36.341
Who, Jessie? Who did it?

01:20:39.383 --> 01:20:41.044
One of them...

01:20:41.652 --> 01:20:43.483
I saw at the center.

01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:47.723
Big, ugly...

01:20:47.991 --> 01:20:49.856
scars on his face.

01:20:50.027 --> 01:20:51.961
Cell phone man.

01:20:52.863 --> 01:20:54.421
What about Tamara?

01:20:55.532 --> 01:20:57.159
They took her.

01:20:57.668 --> 01:20:59.829
I tried, Mr. Barclay.

01:21:00.003 --> 01:21:02.198
Too many of them.

01:21:04.241 --> 01:21:05.503
Jessie, listen up.

01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:09.101
Have you talked to the police yet?

01:21:09.913 --> 01:21:11.437
No.

01:21:11.815 --> 01:21:13.282
Good.

01:21:14.518 --> 01:21:16.281
If they ask you questions...

01:21:16.954 --> 01:21:18.785
don't say shit.

01:21:19.223 --> 01:21:21.657
You cannot even remember your name, okay?

01:21:23.894 --> 01:21:25.327
You did good.

01:21:29.132 --> 01:21:30.394
That goes for all of us.

01:21:30.567 --> 01:21:32.398
Hey, what the fuck are you talking about?

01:21:32.569 --> 01:21:33.866
We know exactly who did this.

01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:37.235
Wayne, he took your sister
because he wants you.

01:21:37.407 --> 01:21:38.704
She's the bait.

01:21:39.076 --> 01:21:42.409
You call the cops, you turn up the heat.

01:21:43.647 --> 01:21:45.911
He might just decide to dump the evidence.

01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.779
Excuse me, sir, this is Intensive Care.
You can't go in there.

01:21:48.952 --> 01:21:52.388
How you doing, miss? Special
police business. I'll make it brief.

01:21:54.825 --> 01:21:57.953
Here to ask Miss Jessie Otero
a few questions.

01:22:01.665 --> 01:22:04.133
Well, please keep it brief.

01:22:04.668 --> 01:22:06.795
She just came out of a coma.

01:22:10.574 --> 01:22:14.101
Well, bad news just seems to follow
you around like a fly following shit.

01:22:14.878 --> 01:22:17.676
What happened? You guys get
into a car wreck on your way here?

01:22:17.848 --> 01:22:19.782
Let's just call it a...

01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:21.383
a collision.

01:22:24.788 --> 01:22:27.086
Can you tell me what happened, young lady?

01:22:30.928 --> 01:22:32.259
Speak up a little, please?

01:22:34.698 --> 01:22:36.427
All right, gentlemen, I'm sorry.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.467
I have to ask you to wait in the hall.
She needs her medication.

01:22:39.636 --> 01:22:40.830
Now.

01:22:41.004 --> 01:22:42.494
Everyone.

01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:48.405
Out.

01:22:49.379 --> 01:22:51.074
Everyone.

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.581
- Out.
- Yeah.

01:22:55.752 --> 01:22:59.552
- She say anything to you guys?
- No. We just got here, detective.

01:22:59.723 --> 01:23:02.783
- Mr. Barclay?
- No. Nothing.

01:23:03.193 --> 01:23:05.559
Goddamn, is everybody here in a coma?

01:23:07.564 --> 01:23:09.657
Any news on your sister?

01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:11.925
What about my sister?

01:23:12.102 --> 01:23:15.902
This girl Jessie, she's your
bodyguard, I just assumed...

01:23:16.073 --> 01:23:17.665
What, that she was with Tamara?

01:23:19.343 --> 01:23:20.708
Now, why would you assume that?

01:23:20.877 --> 01:23:22.469
We sure as hell didn't say nothing.

01:23:22.646 --> 01:23:25.410
It's a lucky guess. You'd have
the female covering the female.

01:23:25.582 --> 01:23:28.278
You guys peeled out of that
community center so fast...

01:23:28.452 --> 01:23:30.420
Too fast to put a tail on us.

01:23:30.587 --> 01:23:33.112
But maybe not for her.

01:23:33.557 --> 01:23:35.286
What the hell are you implying?

01:23:35.459 --> 01:23:37.950
Detective, my sister
did not come back to the house.

01:23:38.128 --> 01:23:39.755
We can't reach her on her cell phone.

01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:42.091
Now, if you know anything
about where she's at...

01:23:42.265 --> 01:23:44.392
- we'd appreciate your help.
- This is an ICU...

01:23:44.568 --> 01:23:47.799
First of all, I never implied
I knew she was missing.

01:23:47.971 --> 01:23:50.633
If she is, we can put out an alert.

01:23:53.543 --> 01:23:55.010
Not yet.

01:23:55.178 --> 01:23:58.670
Might be she's just gone out shopping
and her battery went dead.

01:23:58.849 --> 01:24:01.545
When you're sure, you let me know.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:04.717
I'll be in touch.

01:24:08.025 --> 01:24:12.485
He's got a habit for turning up
at the right time in the right place.

01:24:12.663 --> 01:24:16.224
Maybe it's just a coincidence, huh?

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.134
Hey, Sauvage...

01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:21.460
he's the one.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:25.708
He said you were a lock-up case.

01:24:25.909 --> 01:24:30.243
He said you just went off one day
and killed a bunch of women and kids.

01:24:33.850 --> 01:24:37.809
I did have some
post-traumatic-stress issues.

01:24:38.755 --> 01:24:40.950
That part's true.

01:24:41.725 --> 01:24:46.253
I spent some time
in a V.A. Hospital decompressing.

01:24:48.265 --> 01:24:51.428
But I never killed anyone
who wasn't trying to kill me.

01:24:53.603 --> 01:24:55.400
Almost....

01:25:11.221 --> 01:25:13.280
- Take the shot, Phil.
- She's too close.

01:25:15.926 --> 01:25:17.553
Take the goddamn, shot, Phil!

01:25:22.966 --> 01:25:24.627
No!

01:25:30.407 --> 01:25:33.706
Twenty kids inside that schoolhouse.

01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:35.671
According to Aljazeera...

01:25:35.846 --> 01:25:38.280
and some foreign news services...

01:25:38.448 --> 01:25:41.508
one crazy American killed them all.

01:25:43.053 --> 01:25:46.284
At the time, I almost agreed with them.

01:25:47.758 --> 01:25:50.192
After that, I kind of lost it.

01:25:51.928 --> 01:25:56.262
They sent me home,
had me under observation.

01:25:57.534 --> 01:26:01.698
Bowden came to see how I was doing.

01:26:02.439 --> 01:26:04.168
You know the rest.

01:26:04.407 --> 01:26:06.034
Man.

01:26:06.343 --> 01:26:09.676
Sometimes life sticks it in
and breaks it off good, don't it?

01:26:10.914 --> 01:26:14.748
Now it's your turn. Why the bad blood
between you and Terrell?

01:26:18.655 --> 01:26:20.748
Fifteen years ago...

01:26:21.558 --> 01:26:23.651
when I was first starting out...

01:26:24.928 --> 01:26:28.364
Terrell offered me some big money
to throw a fight.

01:26:30.233 --> 01:26:32.758
It was my first professional bout.

01:26:33.236 --> 01:26:35.329
I said, "Hell, no."

01:26:37.974 --> 01:26:41.034
Did you know Tamara
and I had another brother?

01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:44.271
Yeah. She mentioned it.

01:26:45.015 --> 01:26:46.505
Well...

01:26:46.683 --> 01:26:50.278
I won the fight.
A couple of nights later...

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:52.852
a car drove by the house and...

01:26:53.023 --> 01:26:56.049
somebody inside it shot my little brother.

01:26:58.628 --> 01:27:01.392
They shot him about ten times.

01:27:01.832 --> 01:27:03.800
He died right there on the sidewalk.

01:27:03.967 --> 01:27:07.698
And nobody ever knew who did it or why.

01:27:09.139 --> 01:27:10.970
But if someone was to take a wild guess?

01:27:11.141 --> 01:27:13.200
Yeah, I took that guess...

01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:15.473
about a thousand times...

01:27:15.645 --> 01:27:18.580
and the answer always came back the same.

01:27:19.015 --> 01:27:20.744
Anyway...

01:27:21.551 --> 01:27:23.075
five years ago...

01:27:23.253 --> 01:27:26.086
I came across some
solid evidence that Terrell...

01:27:26.256 --> 01:27:28.781
had been laundering drug money
at my local bank.

01:27:28.959 --> 01:27:32.156
So when the DA's office inquired...

01:27:32.863 --> 01:27:36.993
I found myself faced
with a hard choice, you know?

01:27:37.167 --> 01:27:40.102
Do I protect the man who most likely
shot and killed my brother...?

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:42.397
- Doesn't sound like a hard choice.
- Sauvage...

01:27:42.572 --> 01:27:46.099
if the choice had been easy,
my sister would not be missing tonight.

01:27:53.316 --> 01:27:54.544
Damn.

01:27:54.718 --> 01:27:57.846
It's Lydia. That's all I need.

01:27:58.021 --> 01:28:01.616
Wayne, take the call
but don't tell her I'm with you.

01:28:04.661 --> 01:28:06.959
Hey, what's up, girl?

01:28:07.130 --> 01:28:09.121
Hey, baby.

01:28:10.267 --> 01:28:11.962
Are you alone?

01:28:12.936 --> 01:28:15.063
Yeah, why?

01:28:15.238 --> 01:28:18.537
I can't say too much on the phone. But...

01:28:19.643 --> 01:28:21.804
I need you to come over
as soon as you can.

01:28:22.445 --> 01:28:23.935
What's this about?

01:28:24.948 --> 01:28:26.939
Please, baby, I...

01:28:28.018 --> 01:28:29.576
I can't say anymore.

01:28:30.487 --> 01:28:32.455
Don't bring anyone.

01:28:32.889 --> 01:28:35.483
Especially, that new bodyguard of yours.

01:28:35.659 --> 01:28:38.025
All right. All right, I'll be there.

01:28:38.194 --> 01:28:40.287
Alone, in 30 minutes.

01:28:44.467 --> 01:28:46.435
Wayne, I can't let you go.

01:28:46.603 --> 01:28:49.436
Look, my sister's life
is on the line here, Sauvage.

01:28:49.606 --> 01:28:52.166
I just remembered
what my ex-bodyguard said:

01:28:52.342 --> 01:28:55.334
"We turn up the heat, Terrell
might just dump the evidence."

01:28:55.512 --> 01:28:57.104
Wayne, if we do this right...

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.274
he won't know the heat is turned up
until his ass is in the frying pan, okay?

01:29:16.266 --> 01:29:19.326
Shit. Whose ass is in the frying pan?

01:29:28.778 --> 01:29:30.575
Baby.

01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:33.982
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry about this.

01:29:45.495 --> 01:29:48.692
Didn't I tell you, Wayne?
I'm your biggest fan.

01:29:53.703 --> 01:29:54.692
Where's Tamara?

01:29:54.871 --> 01:29:57.135
Easy, champ, don't jump
to any hasty conclusions.

01:29:57.507 --> 01:29:59.941
I gotta pat you down, sorry.

01:30:01.911 --> 01:30:04.106
- You're not wearing a wire, are you?
- Why?

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.770
What you afraid of?

01:30:05.949 --> 01:30:07.814
Or should I ask what's Terrell afraid of?

01:30:07.984 --> 01:30:09.975
There you go again,
jumping to conclusions.

01:30:10.153 --> 01:30:11.381
Excuse me?

01:30:11.554 --> 01:30:15.046
When I see a police detective
moonlighting for a convicted felon...

01:30:15.225 --> 01:30:16.556
what am I supposed to think?

01:30:16.726 --> 01:30:18.785
You're supposed to think
your number one fan...

01:30:18.962 --> 01:30:20.589
is trying to do you another solid.

01:30:21.531 --> 01:30:23.556
Terrell is offering you an olive branch.

01:30:23.733 --> 01:30:25.724
It's up to you whether you take it or not.

01:30:25.902 --> 01:30:27.893
Yeah, with my sister
as the bargaining chip.

01:30:29.072 --> 01:30:32.872
- And what happens to her if I say no?
- Come on, champ, don't be so negative.

01:30:33.043 --> 01:30:34.977
You need to deal directly with Singletery.

01:30:35.145 --> 01:30:38.080
I'm just here to facilitate that.

01:30:38.882 --> 01:30:40.713
- Terrell's coming here?
- No.

01:30:40.884 --> 01:30:42.943
As a gesture of openness
and conciliation...

01:30:43.119 --> 01:30:45.679
he's invited you to his home.

01:30:46.156 --> 01:30:47.919
And Mr. Singletery's associates here...

01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:50.582
will be providing transportation
and security.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.729
Oh, I see. That's very generous of him.

01:30:55.165 --> 01:30:56.427
Where's your bodyguard?

01:31:10.113 --> 01:31:11.580
- Oh, Jesus!
- Watch out.

01:31:11.748 --> 01:31:13.215
Cujo, hit the breaker.

01:31:14.617 --> 01:31:15.914
Bitch.

01:31:18.655 --> 01:31:20.589
Your security just flunked
their first test.

01:31:20.757 --> 01:31:23.487
So I'll provide my own
if Mr. Singletery doesn't mind.

01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.060
You're making a serious
fucking mistake, Wayne.

01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:29.426
Yeah, there you go again,
motherfucker, jumping to conclusions.

01:32:25.455 --> 01:32:27.821
I believe Terrell's been expecting me.

01:32:29.559 --> 01:32:33.154
- Don't! We'll all die.
- Put them down.

01:32:37.433 --> 01:32:39.993
I'll go tell Mr. Singletery you're here.

01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:41.701
Hey, stay right there.

01:32:42.705 --> 01:32:44.832
Use the intercom.

01:32:49.078 --> 01:32:50.636
Yo, Terrell.

01:32:50.813 --> 01:32:52.337
You got visitors down here.

01:32:52.515 --> 01:32:54.346
They're in.

01:32:54.517 --> 01:32:57.486
Visitors? I was only expecting one guest.

01:32:57.654 --> 01:33:00.748
Well, your guest brought friends.

01:33:01.891 --> 01:33:04.883
I see. I'll be right down.

01:33:09.666 --> 01:33:11.930
Make sure my other guest is comfortable.

01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:16.395
I'll go check on her.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.308
Unless you'd rather have me
hang here with y'all...

01:33:20.476 --> 01:33:23.570
in which case, you might as well
hook me up with one of them.

01:33:25.515 --> 01:33:27.915
Choice number one.

01:33:29.252 --> 01:33:31.948
Y'all come with me.

01:33:32.889 --> 01:33:35.050
Check on that bitch.

01:33:42.031 --> 01:33:44.966
You have been neutralized.

01:33:51.341 --> 01:33:53.832
Uncle Terrell wants you two
down in the garage.

01:33:55.078 --> 01:33:57.979
Motherfuckers, must I tell him
I had to ask twice?

01:34:00.383 --> 01:34:03.546
You gotta put some pep
in your step. Come on. Move.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.551
- Oh, man.
- Thank you.

01:34:05.722 --> 01:34:08.691
- What's your problem, man?
- Excuse me?

01:34:08.858 --> 01:34:10.086
What?

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:11.955
The key for the handcuffs.

01:34:14.364 --> 01:34:16.457
Thanks, bro.

01:34:41.257 --> 01:34:42.451
You're Leonard.

01:34:42.625 --> 01:34:43.853
The attorney?

01:34:44.027 --> 01:34:46.791
The one who helped my uncle
get his early release.

01:34:46.963 --> 01:34:48.988
I don't know how I can begin to apologize.

01:34:49.165 --> 01:34:52.225
- You can start with these.
- Oh, certainly.

01:34:52.402 --> 01:34:55.462
This whole thing has been
such a terrible mistake.

01:34:56.606 --> 01:34:57.834
Thank you.

01:34:58.007 --> 01:35:00.134
Maybe I can prevent it
from becoming a tragedy.

01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:01.607
Thank you.

01:35:03.112 --> 01:35:05.376
Oh, my God. We are so busted.

01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:16.122
Wayne Barclay.

01:35:17.727 --> 01:35:19.388
I've dreamed of this moment.

01:35:19.762 --> 01:35:21.559
Keep right on dreaming.

01:35:22.198 --> 01:35:23.825
Tamara.

01:35:26.369 --> 01:35:27.631
Are you okay?

01:35:28.604 --> 01:35:30.299
Yeah.

01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:36.043
Thank you.

01:35:36.212 --> 01:35:37.543
God, thank you.

01:35:38.081 --> 01:35:40.481
Wait, wait. You're not the police?

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:43.475
No. We're the Hard Corps.

01:35:43.853 --> 01:35:46.048
And you tell your homeboys
to drop their hardware.

01:35:46.222 --> 01:35:48.588
Or Dirty Harry here
gets to meet Elvis real quick.

01:35:48.758 --> 01:35:50.623
Oh, that'd be a big shame.

01:35:50.793 --> 01:35:52.590
Good help's so hard to find.

01:36:02.138 --> 01:36:04.038
Oh, God, no. I'm too late.

01:36:10.213 --> 01:36:12.113
We got Tamara.
What's happening down there?

01:36:12.281 --> 01:36:13.578
Keeping these folks busy.

01:36:16.252 --> 01:36:17.719
- Need some help?
- Negative.

01:36:17.887 --> 01:36:19.821
Just get Miss Barclay off the premises.

01:36:19.989 --> 01:36:23.015
- Okay, let's go.
- Where's my brother?

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:25.591
Wayne, they got Tamara.

01:36:26.763 --> 01:36:28.958
- Where's that gunfire from?
- Where'd that kid go?

01:36:29.132 --> 01:36:31.760
- That kid is Terrell's nephew.
- Shit. Come on, let's go.

01:36:52.555 --> 01:36:53.988
Shit.

01:37:07.136 --> 01:37:09.001
Simcoe, let me have a clip, man.

01:37:09.172 --> 01:37:10.833
Yo, this is my last one, man.

01:37:11.007 --> 01:37:13.032
- What?
- Can't do nothing for you, baby.

01:37:13.342 --> 01:37:14.570
Sorry.

01:37:14.744 --> 01:37:16.109
Motherfuckers!

01:37:17.079 --> 01:37:18.603
- I'm out of here.
- Where you going?

01:37:18.781 --> 01:37:21.147
Getting the fuck out of here.
Getting the fuck out.

01:37:21.317 --> 01:37:23.285
- Getting the fuck out of here.
- You bitch!

01:37:37.366 --> 01:37:39.630
Barclay?

01:37:40.169 --> 01:37:42.364
Barclay? Listen, listen, listen, man.

01:37:42.538 --> 01:37:44.529
I got something to tell you, man. Come on.

01:37:48.744 --> 01:37:51.212
Okay, I'm gonna tell you
who took down your brother.

01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:53.280
I know you wanna know that.

01:37:53.449 --> 01:37:54.711
I'm putting my guns down.

01:37:56.319 --> 01:37:57.786
Look.

01:37:59.722 --> 01:38:01.019
Come on, man.

01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:03.522
Let's talk. I'm a businessman.

01:38:03.693 --> 01:38:05.661
You a businessman.

01:38:10.766 --> 01:38:12.131
Right?

01:38:12.301 --> 01:38:17.170
See, usually,
I delegate the unpleasant tasks.

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.898
But I gotta tell you something.

01:38:20.743 --> 01:38:23.041
Popping that bitch was pure pleasure.

01:38:23.212 --> 01:38:24.509
You motherfucker.

01:38:35.157 --> 01:38:37.819
And now I'm gonna get
a hundred percent more pleasure...

01:38:37.994 --> 01:38:41.430
by popping the bitch
I should have popped back then.

01:38:41.597 --> 01:38:43.394
Uncle T! No!

01:38:49.338 --> 01:38:51.067
Uncle T, please.

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.502
We can still mitigate this.

01:38:53.276 --> 01:38:55.836
Put down the gun.
It doesn't have to end this way.

01:38:56.012 --> 01:38:57.502
There's no other way it can end.

01:39:09.191 --> 01:39:11.819
Oh, my God. Mullins.

01:39:12.261 --> 01:39:14.195
Phil, take them out.

01:39:14.597 --> 01:39:16.724
- I'll be okay.
- That's an order, soldier.

01:39:16.899 --> 01:39:18.127
Go.

01:39:18.301 --> 01:39:20.895
- Casey, cover me.
- Go. Now!

01:40:25.968 --> 01:40:28.528
It's the meat. They want some fresh meat.

01:40:46.322 --> 01:40:48.722
Yeah, you like that, motherfucker? Yeah!

01:41:46.449 --> 01:41:48.508
Oh, Mr. Barclay?

01:41:48.684 --> 01:41:50.845
Can I have your autograph now?

01:41:55.458 --> 01:41:56.755
Yeah. Yeah, bitch.

01:41:56.926 --> 01:41:59.417
Come on. Right there with your punk ass.

01:42:03.365 --> 01:42:04.389
Yeah.

01:42:04.934 --> 01:42:06.526
Where were we, bitch?

01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:09.700
You think you can take me out, nigga?

01:42:10.239 --> 01:42:12.639
Who'd you think you was messing with, huh?

01:42:12.808 --> 01:42:14.639
You ready to say hello to baby brother?

01:42:15.144 --> 01:42:17.135
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

01:42:17.313 --> 01:42:18.780
Fuck you, nigga!

01:42:47.777 --> 01:42:49.438
Sauvage!

01:42:50.146 --> 01:42:51.841
Oh, shit.

01:42:52.014 --> 01:42:53.914
No, no, no.

01:42:54.083 --> 01:42:57.416
Come on. Come on, Sauvage. Come on, man.

01:42:57.586 --> 01:42:59.076
Sauvage. Hey, Sauvage!

01:43:00.122 --> 01:43:01.453
Get up.

01:43:01.624 --> 01:43:03.285
Phil! You hear me, Phil?

01:43:03.459 --> 01:43:06.792
Wake up. Phil. Phil, get up!

01:43:06.962 --> 01:43:09.089
Get up, Phil!

01:43:13.269 --> 01:43:15.931
- Hey, Phil?
- Wayne.

01:43:20.342 --> 01:43:22.003
That fucking hurt.

01:43:23.579 --> 01:43:25.171
Hey, you're gonna be all right.

01:43:26.048 --> 01:43:29.245
- Phil. Phil, you're gonna be all right.
- Okay. Okay.

01:43:41.363 --> 01:43:43.558
Just can't seem to stay out of it, can we?

01:43:44.166 --> 01:43:46.293
Hell of a way
to make a living, that's for sure.

01:43:48.003 --> 01:43:50.369
Get better real soon.

01:43:50.539 --> 01:43:52.029
I'm down with that.

01:43:52.208 --> 01:43:56.304
- You okay?
- Well, I've been better.

01:43:56.478 --> 01:43:58.105
- But, yeah, I'm good.
- Thanks, man.

01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:00.214
You all right?

01:44:12.228 --> 01:44:13.923
You were right, kid.

01:44:14.096 --> 01:44:15.996
Didn't have to end this way.

01:44:16.165 --> 01:44:18.224
Mr. Barclay?

01:44:19.068 --> 01:44:22.560
Teague's been under an internal
investigation for some time now.

01:44:22.738 --> 01:44:24.933
That security detail?

01:44:25.107 --> 01:44:27.041
They weren't just keeping an eye on you.

01:44:27.209 --> 01:44:28.870
They were watching him too.

01:44:29.044 --> 01:44:31.945
Right. So in other words, I was a decoy?

01:44:32.114 --> 01:44:33.945
Well, not exactly.

01:44:34.116 --> 01:44:35.378
Try bait.

01:44:35.551 --> 01:44:38.577
Fortunately, we had Mr. Sauvage.

01:44:38.754 --> 01:44:41.154
Yeah, and I owe it all to you, sis.

01:44:41.323 --> 01:44:44.349
Even if he can be
one royal pain in the ass.

01:44:44.526 --> 01:44:47.017
That's what you pay me for, sir.

01:44:47.196 --> 01:44:50.893
Or should I say, paid me for.

01:44:51.066 --> 01:44:52.931
Excuse me?

01:44:53.102 --> 01:44:55.070
Since when, Wayne?

01:44:55.437 --> 01:44:56.995
That was just a misunderstanding.

01:44:57.172 --> 01:44:58.867
- My ass.
- Come on, I've been shot.

01:44:59.041 --> 01:45:01.407
- So?
- Baby, you okay?

01:45:01.577 --> 01:45:02.942
Hey, what's up, baby?

01:45:04.747 --> 01:45:06.908
I've been so worried.

01:45:07.082 --> 01:45:09.050
Looks like you're in so much pain.

01:45:09.218 --> 01:45:12.244
He punched me in the eye
a little bit, you know.

01:45:12.421 --> 01:45:14.651
Looks like you need some special healing.

01:45:14.823 --> 01:45:18.816
Actually, it's a proven fact.
A little sugar can work miracles.

01:45:18.994 --> 01:45:20.518
Oh, really?

01:45:20.696 --> 01:45:22.891
And who's your miracle-worker?

01:45:23.065 --> 01:45:26.557
Don't have one yet,
but I'm taking resumes.

01:45:26.735 --> 01:45:29.636
Well, then allow me to submit mine.

01:45:32.041 --> 01:45:33.338
Hey, hey, hey.

01:45:33.509 --> 01:45:35.807
I suppose you're gonna
call that another peck.

01:45:36.979 --> 01:45:39.140
Wayne, turn around.

01:45:39.315 --> 01:45:41.306
Wayne, turn around.
