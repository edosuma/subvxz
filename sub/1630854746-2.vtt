You're very close to me. Hey, Z?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.470
Are you expecting
annoying visitors?

11:36.670 --> 11:38.050
[creature squeaks]

11:38.250 --> 11:39.680
[gurgles]

11:39.880 --> 11:41.220
[Zahra] Visitors?

11:41.420 --> 11:43.520
No.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.520
[exhales]

11:45.720 --> 11:47.770
Zahra, darling.

11:47.970 --> 11:50.810
Still sharpening your horns,
I see.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.230
Yes, and you're still sticking

11:53.430 --> 11:55.400
dead things in your hair.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.700
When's the last time
we saw each other?

11:57.900 --> 11:59.320
Was it...?

11:59.520 --> 12:01.490
Oh, I know. When you ditched us

12:01.690 --> 12:03.240
to poach my monster

12:03.440 --> 12:05.390
and steal the Take's reward.

12:07.510 --> 12:10.580
You heard
about our little prank?

12:10.780 --> 12:13.630
[scoffs] You're not as charming
as you think, Vex'ahlia.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.510
You never were.

12:15.710 --> 12:18.260
Hmm, as much
as I'd love to chitchat,

12:18.460 --> 12:20.300
we're actually
on urgent business.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.470
We need to see your patron?

12:22.670 --> 12:24.600
No one sees her.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.270
Especially not someone
who owes the Take...

12:27.470 --> 12:29.350
how much was it, Kash?

12:29.550 --> 12:31.610
12,000 gold
or the head of a hydra.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.650
Got either on you?

12:33.850 --> 12:36.150
12,000 is nothing compared

12:36.350 --> 12:37.900
to the horde of a dragon.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.990
A dragon?

12:40.190 --> 12:41.620
Four, actually.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.490
All incredibly wealthy.

12:43.690 --> 12:46.330
Help us
and that wealth could be yours.

12:46.530 --> 12:47.910
[laughs] Oh, please.

12:48.110 --> 12:49.960
They're destroying Tal'Dorei.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.290
Killing innocent people.

12:51.490 --> 12:53.090
This isn't about money.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.090
This is about saving lives.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.230
[laughter]

12:58.690 --> 13:00.840
[Kashaw] Aw, I just want
to put her in my pocket.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.800
I know, she's so cute.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.680
Ah, I'm sorry, love.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.490
The Slayer's Take doesn't do
anything for free.

13:08.490 --> 13:10.020
Now...

13:10.220 --> 13:12.940
let's discuss your payment plan.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.830
With interest.

13:15.710 --> 13:17.960
[all grunting]

13:19.630 --> 13:22.070
Super shitty time to lose Grog.

13:22.270 --> 13:24.320
Look, we're not here
to fight you.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.120
Well, this will be easy then.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.250
[growls, snorts]

13:29.450 --> 13:31.920
[laughs]

13:32.120 --> 13:34.040
Damn it! Don't you get it?

13:34.240 --> 13:36.340
We're trying to save
the fucking world!

13:36.540 --> 13:37.380
[groans]

13:37.580 --> 13:39.130
[roars]

13:39.330 --> 13:40.520
[female voice] Hold!

13:42.190 --> 13:45.390
Not sure I want to know
what that was.

13:45.590 --> 13:48.620
[female voice] I will
take care of Vox Machina.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.440
[Zahra] You heard her.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.160
Fuck.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.190
- [clank]
- [whirring]

13:57.390 --> 14:00.590
[all shouting]

14:05.170 --> 14:07.660
Where do you find your strength?

14:07.860 --> 14:09.220
What you mean?

14:10.510 --> 14:11.750
Aah!

14:11.950 --> 14:14.460
[coughing]

14:14.660 --> 14:16.840
You walk between worlds.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.000
Weakness in mind and weakness

14:19.200 --> 14:20.920
in conviction.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.880
Where does
your strength come from?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.800
[Grog groans, scoffs]

14:26.000 --> 14:28.060
I wasn't ready.
I'd like to see you

14:28.250 --> 14:30.930
try that again after I ra...

14:31.130 --> 14:33.740
[grunts]

14:36.080 --> 14:37.440
[coughs]

14:37.640 --> 14:39.000
[weakly] Rage.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.360
[grunts]

14:41.560 --> 14:43.860
[doors creak shut]

14:44.060 --> 14:45.320
Yeah, I got to say,
I'm not a fan

14:45.520 --> 14:47.160
of the sudden drops today.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.700
I recall you saying you were
friends with those people.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.080
I may have misjudged
our relationship.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.250
[Vax] Look on the bright side.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.670
At least they can't murder us
down here.

14:56.870 --> 14:58.750
[creature growling]

14:58.950 --> 15:01.300
But whatever that is can.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.360
Maybe they want to help?

15:08.780 --> 15:10.350
[Vax] Hello?

15:10.550 --> 15:12.070
[groans]

15:14.330 --> 15:16.600
God, this city blows.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.770
[growling]

15:18.970 --> 15:20.170
[grunts]

15:21.670 --> 15:24.190
Don't those usually,
you know, come back?

15:24.390 --> 15:26.820
[female voice] Weapons
are useless here.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.740
You're scared.

15:28.940 --> 15:31.290
I wonder, how do you hope
to avenge Emon,

15:31.480 --> 15:33.660
when darkness makes you tremble

15:33.860 --> 15:35.290
like children?

15:35.490 --> 15:37.960
Are you... the patron?

15:38.160 --> 15:40.340
How astute.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.130
Call me Osysa.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.800
Chosen of the Knowing Mistress

15:46.000 --> 15:48.590
and Patron of the Slayer's Take.

15:48.790 --> 15:50.930
[Keyleth] A Sphinx.

15:51.130 --> 15:53.390
I didn't realize
they still existed.

15:53.590 --> 15:55.930
[Pike] We humbly seek your aid.

15:56.130 --> 15:57.850
Yes.

15:58.050 --> 16:00.150
You hope to save Tal'Dorei.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.650
You know of the dragons?

16:01.850 --> 16:03.610
Please, we're desperate.

16:03.810 --> 16:07.710
But you haven't the slightest
idea what it will cost.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.990
- [Pike shouting]
- Pike! Aah!

16:12.190 --> 16:13.410
[Scanlan echoing]

16:13.610 --> 16:16.330
[others screaming]

16:16.530 --> 16:19.080
- [grunts]
- [Osysa] Ah, the twins.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.630
You depended entirely
on your sister.

16:21.830 --> 16:23.460
[both gasp]

16:23.660 --> 16:25.130
You...

16:25.330 --> 16:28.130
hopelessly seeking
your father's love.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.240
Both unprepared.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.760
[screams]

16:33.960 --> 16:35.310
[clears throat]

16:35.510 --> 16:37.640
[Groon] Show me your conviction.

16:37.840 --> 16:41.230
Where does
your strength come from?

16:41.430 --> 16:42.690
[sighs]

16:42.890 --> 16:44.820
Why do you keep saying that?!

16:45.020 --> 16:46.400
[grunts]

16:46.600 --> 16:48.450
- Hmm.
- [Grog shouting]

16:48.640 --> 16:51.030
You wield such a dark weapon.

16:51.230 --> 16:53.370
A reliance
that proves your frailty.

16:53.570 --> 16:54.800
[grunting]

17:01.350 --> 17:03.420
What have we done?

17:03.620 --> 17:05.210
Show yourself!

17:05.410 --> 17:08.220
[Osysa] Why would I listen
to the cursed heir?

17:08.410 --> 17:10.840
Who wallows in self-pity,

17:11.040 --> 17:13.180
begging to be trusted again.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.760
[panting]

17:14.960 --> 17:16.930
[shouting]

17:17.130 --> 17:18.480
[grunts]

17:18.670 --> 17:20.520
She's trying
to get in our heads.

17:20.720 --> 17:21.980
[Osysa] Says the hopeless
holy warrior.

17:22.180 --> 17:23.690
You don't even have faith

17:23.890 --> 17:26.650
that you can save
those dearest to you.

17:26.850 --> 17:28.860
This doesn't have to be a fight.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.240
If you won't help us,
we can leave.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.080
[Osysa] Fleeing
from your duties again, Keyleth?

17:35.270 --> 17:39.120
Tell me,
what do you fear more...

17:39.320 --> 17:41.500
failing your Aramenté?

17:41.700 --> 17:43.460
Or knowing
no one will live long enough

17:43.660 --> 17:45.380
to see you achieve it?

17:45.580 --> 17:47.810
[screams]

17:49.980 --> 17:51.880
You don't have to call out
my shit, okay?

17:52.080 --> 17:53.840
I know I can be
kind of annoying.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.560
[Osysa] No one cares about you.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.020
I'm no different.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.530
- [growls]
- [Scanlan] Well, damn.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.460
- [grunting]
- [bones crunch]

18:06.500 --> 18:07.900
[sighs]

18:08.100 --> 18:11.040
Where does
your strength come from?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.610
This is one of them
trick questions.

18:14.810 --> 18:17.530
You want me to say
my muscles or my rage.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.080
But I know it's my heart.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.520
That's my real strength.

18:24.810 --> 18:26.250
[Groon] Wrong.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.770
[grunting]

18:32.650 --> 18:34.050
[Osysa growls]

18:34.250 --> 18:36.070
Paralyzed by fear.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.890
You want to turn
your back and run,

18:39.090 --> 18:40.140
like you have all your lives.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.890
[all panting]

18:42.090 --> 18:44.140
How do you expect
to save the world

18:44.340 --> 18:47.110
if you can't even save
yourselves?

18:47.310 --> 18:49.360
- [Grog grunting]
- Where does your strength

18:49.560 --> 18:51.900
come from?!

18:52.100 --> 18:54.050
[shouts]

18:55.210 --> 18:57.740
I don't...

18:57.940 --> 18:59.700
know.

18:59.900 --> 19:03.250
I've seen the same
for a hundred years.

19:03.450 --> 19:06.790
Fools who think they can make
a difference but can't deliver.

19:06.990 --> 19:08.790
Leave now with whatever dignity

19:08.990 --> 19:10.980
you have left.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.840
Fuck dignity.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.260
I'm not leaving.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.260
Not giving up...

19:20.460 --> 19:22.410
until someone listens.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.610
And if I don't?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.150
Would you sacrifice your life
just to prove a point?

19:32.350 --> 19:35.070
[Pike] I don't care if I die.
None of us do.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.990
But we're not leaving.

19:37.190 --> 19:39.800
We won't be ignored.

19:40.970 --> 19:43.410
[Osysa] You have found
what you need.

19:43.610 --> 19:45.930
The will to give everything.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.350
[grunting]

19:53.560 --> 19:56.010
Oh, okay, oh. Easy.

19:56.210 --> 19:58.720
You have much to learn
about being a warrior.

19:58.920 --> 20:01.180
Seeking the path
to true strength

20:01.380 --> 20:03.180
is the first step.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.640
[exhales]

20:05.840 --> 20:07.140
Cool.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.060
And you'll, um,

20:09.260 --> 20:11.730
show me the next one?

20:11.930 --> 20:13.780
[Groon] I already have.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.920
[Grog] Uh, good talk.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.330
You'll need strength
to defeat the dragons.

20:22.530 --> 20:25.200
But also knowledge.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.960
Knowledge? Of what?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.730
The Vestiges of Divergence.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.340
<i>In the Great Calamity,</i>

20:35.540 --> 20:39.430
<i>these weapons of war</i>
<i>were created to strike down</i>

20:39.630 --> 20:41.890
<i>the gods themselves.</i>

20:42.090 --> 20:45.220
<i>Believed too powerful</i>
<i>for mere mortals to wield,</i>

20:45.420 --> 20:49.020
<i>the vestiges were scattered</i>
<i>across the lands.</i>

20:49.220 --> 20:52.400
<i>Buried, lost, forgotten.</i>

20:52.600 --> 20:54.320
<i>Or perhaps...</i>

20:54.520 --> 20:56.400
<i>waiting to be found.</i>

20:56.600 --> 20:59.990
<i>The Deathwalker's Ward is</i>
<i>one such vestige.</i>

21:00.190 --> 21:03.530
<i>The Matron of Ravens'</i>
<i>own armor lies entombed</i>

21:03.730 --> 21:06.180
<i>by a lake to the west.</i>

21:08.970 --> 21:10.750
And the other vestiges?

21:10.950 --> 21:13.130
Will be revealed in turn.

21:13.330 --> 21:14.840
Find this one

21:15.040 --> 21:16.880
and bring it to my mate.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.340
Nice.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.010
Big fan of mating over here.

21:20.210 --> 21:21.430
[grunts]

21:21.630 --> 21:23.970
As the Knowing Mistress
heals in exile,

21:24.170 --> 21:26.010
to protect her sacred wisdom,

21:26.210 --> 21:28.100
we must remain apart.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.270
It pains me.

21:30.470 --> 21:32.310
Yet it is for a greater good.

21:32.510 --> 21:33.860
He...

21:34.060 --> 21:35.440
[sighs]

21:35.640 --> 21:37.650
He will await you.

21:37.850 --> 21:40.150
Use these vestiges
against the dragons.

21:40.350 --> 21:42.820
You must not fail.

21:43.020 --> 21:45.830
Righting the imbalance
these horrid creatures bring

21:46.030 --> 21:48.680
depends on your success.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.170
Thank you.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.710
We won't let you down.

21:53.910 --> 21:57.420
It's not me you need
to worry about letting down.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.480
Only each other.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.640
[Zahra] Who do you think
Osysa killed first?

22:03.830 --> 22:05.550
Probably ate them, right?

22:05.750 --> 22:07.390
- Ah, probably the little one.
- Mm.

22:07.590 --> 22:08.810
- Perfect appetizer.
- [laughs]

22:09.010 --> 22:10.390
[stammers] You're alive?

22:10.590 --> 22:13.980
No big. Osysa asked us
to find something for her.

22:14.180 --> 22:16.060
Our patron has a job

22:16.260 --> 22:17.690
for you?

22:17.890 --> 22:19.780
Guess I'm quite charming
after all.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.860
I'd say it was nice catching up,

22:22.060 --> 22:24.700
but... it wasn't.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.790
Vasselheim wasn't
what we expected.

22:34.990 --> 22:37.670
We came to get an army, but
maybe we got something better.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.010
Inspiration.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.720
Huh, that's a new one for us.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.680
Step one, find the vestiges.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.680
Step two, kill some dragons.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.600
Step three...

22:48.800 --> 22:50.220
Mm, profit?

22:50.420 --> 22:53.850
How about step one,
we get a fucking drink?

22:54.050 --> 22:56.770
- Grog! What happened to you?
- [Scanlan groans]

22:56.970 --> 22:59.650
Oh, an old man beat me up.
[grunts]

22:59.850 --> 23:02.320
- So, booze?
- Well... yeah!

23:02.520 --> 23:04.860
- [Keyleth] Lead the way.
- [Vax] First round's on you,
big man.

23:05.060 --> 23:07.010
[indistinct chatter]

23:08.260 --> 23:10.080
[bell jingles]

23:10.280 --> 23:12.910
- [Victor] Ah, come in!
- [Percy] Wasn't sure
I'd find a black powder

23:13.110 --> 23:15.080
- dealer here in Vasselheim.
- [Victor laughs]

23:15.280 --> 23:16.920
You'd be surprised.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.540
In fact, business is booming!

23:19.740 --> 23:21.420
- [Percy grunts]
- [laughing] Pun intended.

23:21.620 --> 23:23.010
Relax.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.920
It's only coffee.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.050
I think. You know,

23:27.250 --> 23:30.680
you're the second person
to buy black powder this week.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.930
Really?

23:33.130 --> 23:35.980
Do you recall what this
other customer looked like?

23:36.180 --> 23:38.560
Ah, sure, I remember her well.

23:38.760 --> 23:41.230
'Cause she had one hand.

23:41.430 --> 23:42.530
Kind of like me. [chuckles]

23:42.730 --> 23:44.570
I've learned from my mistakes!

23:44.770 --> 23:46.570
Ripley.

23:46.770 --> 23:48.490
Something wrong, Percy dear?

23:48.690 --> 23:51.590
Oh. Nothing at all.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.540
[Victor] And don't
blow yourself up!

23:56.740 --> 23:58.250
Bye!

23:58.450 --> 24:00.000
Huh? [whimpering]
