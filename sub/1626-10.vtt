00:01.534 --> 00:04.269
Okay, max, I figured out
our new schedule.

00:04.271 --> 00:05.771
And I figured out
the cheap toothpaste

00:05.773 --> 00:08.941
We've been using
is really diaper cream.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.810
On the plus side,
that rash cleared up on my gums.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.113
We'll do our diner shift
from 6:00 till 2:00,

00:14.115 --> 00:15.981
Then sell cupcakes here
from 2:00 to 4:00,

00:15.983 --> 00:18.117
Make the cupcakes in the morning
from 7:00 to 11:00,

00:18.119 --> 00:19.685
And then pastry school
from 12:00 to 4:00.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.287
Forget anything?
Just poopin' and sleepin'.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.957
Now, I have to go
rewrite the schedule.

00:24.959 --> 00:28.060
Let's go, max, you have a huge,
huge day tomorrow.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.361
First day
of pastry school.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.063
Stop saying it's huge.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.498
Whenever I think
something's gonna be huge,

00:32.500 --> 00:35.834
It just turns out
to be all balls.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.250
I splurged
and had my blouse cleaned.

00:51.252 --> 00:54.153
Dry cleaning bags remind me
of when I had money.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.487
Really?
They remind me

00:55.489 --> 00:58.524
Of when my mother tried
to suffocate me.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.826
Allegedly.
Let's go.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.261
Wait, wait.
Max, you can't go yet.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.096
I need you to stay
and help with something.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.198
Han, I told you--
it's bend and wipe,

01:06.200 --> 01:08.700
Then up come
your big boy pants.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.035
Yeah, han's right.
You can't go.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.504
Stay here
a few more minutes.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.073
Why?
Oh.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.842
Are we having an intervention
for max?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.577
Hey, everybody.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.412
Oh, I hope I'm not late
for max's

01:20.414 --> 01:23.782
First day of school
surprise party.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.118
Sophie, we hadn't
surprised her yet.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.120
Oh, but she's
right there.

01:28.122 --> 01:31.523
You just
blew it, han.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.592
Aw, a surprise party.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.028
Isn't this sweet, max?
I don't trust it.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.729
Last time oleg yelled
"surprise" at me,

01:37.731 --> 01:41.733
His penis was
on a hot dog bun.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.036
One meat lover's pizza.

01:44.038 --> 01:47.739
And one meat lover.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.641
Max, come on.
Get it while it's hot.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.144
You're opening that box.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.745
Hm, who's got
a ten

01:53.747 --> 01:56.615
To tip the cute
pizza delivery guy?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.118
Sophie, this is luis,
the day waiter.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.054
Oh, you're sophie,

02:02.056 --> 02:04.089
Oleg's ex.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.492
Sister, I know
all about you.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.127
Oh, do you?

02:08.129 --> 02:11.063
Do you know
all about me?

02:11.065 --> 02:13.732
I'm his good friend.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.168
You know, I'm having trouble
hearing your accent.

02:16.170 --> 02:20.072
Did you say "good friend"
or "girlfriend?"

02:20.074 --> 02:22.574
Please, <i>mami.</i>
<i>I wish.</i>

02:22.576 --> 02:24.143
I like the entertainment.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.677
It's better than
the magician

02:25.679 --> 02:27.146
At my friend stephanie's
16th birthday

02:27.148 --> 02:30.983
That made
her virginity disappear.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.951
Max, we're all so proud
of you.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.254
Tomorrow is the first day
of the rest of your life.

02:35.256 --> 02:38.657
Aw, crap.
I gotta do this again?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.958
All right, but this time,
I'm not seeing

02:39.960 --> 02:41.660
<i>Trouble with the curve.</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:43.862
You are about to do something
very big.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.998
Yes, she is.
Such a big step.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.499
Big step
for both of us,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.168
'cause I'll be using
my business acumen

02:49.170 --> 02:51.103
Working in the office
to help pay the tuition.

02:51.105 --> 02:54.306
Shh.
I'm talking about max.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.141
So we all chipped in
to get you something

02:56.143 --> 02:57.176
For your first day
of school.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.644
It's my first
day too.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.145
Caroline, please,
I can't hear han

03:00.147 --> 03:02.347
Talking about max, okay?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.283
Here you go, darling,

03:04.285 --> 03:07.553
A book bag
for school.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.221
So what, then?
Is my surprise party

03:09.223 --> 03:10.656
After this one?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.658
What is happening?

03:12.660 --> 03:15.294
People doing nice things
for me and smiling?

03:15.296 --> 03:19.164
Am I transferring
foster homes again?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.999
And there's
more stuff inside.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.902
That was supposed to be
a surprise too.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.873
Oh.
Surprise!

03:27.875 --> 03:29.508
Max, open it.
Look inside.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.244
Yeah, max, see what's inside
for your big day.

03:32.246 --> 03:35.414
Big day for max.
Big day for me as well.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.216
A metrocard?
No way.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.418
From me.
Unlimited rides.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.653
Oh.
Unlimited rides?

03:41.655 --> 03:45.457
Is that what
your tramp stamp says?

03:48.928 --> 03:52.931
I was gonna get mad,
but that was a damn good one.

03:52.933 --> 03:56.168
What's this?
Han's house?

03:58.271 --> 04:01.373
A simple "thank you"
would suffice.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.709
Thank you for
your house, han.

04:03.711 --> 04:06.745
It's a pencil case,
and I love it.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.380
And I was sitting here,
thinking how you were

04:08.382 --> 04:10.015
All ignoring my part
of the big day.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.850
And then, you give me
this pencil case

04:11.852 --> 04:14.853
To use in the office
and prove me wrong.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.388
That's for max.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.958
What the hell
is wrong with you people?

04:19.960 --> 04:21.360
Max doesn't even
need pencils.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.395
She'll be baking.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.364
(earl)
well, she'll be baked.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.232
Take a look.

04:27.234 --> 04:30.235
(max)
[gasps]
joints.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.970
Earl, that's so sweet.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.207
These should last me
till recess.

04:35.209 --> 04:38.377
Wait, where's the chef's coat
sophie had monogrammed?

04:38.379 --> 04:41.213
Han, that was supposed to be
a surprise.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.615
Oh, I know.
Karma's a bitch.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.284
Oh, well.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.219
Look.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.454
(max)
[gasps]
my name's on this.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.956
[laughs]
the only thing my name's

04:50.958 --> 04:55.227
Ever been on before
is a urine sample.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.628
Thank you, everyone.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.465
So there is nothing
in that bag for me?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.334
Nothing?
Wow.

05:02.336 --> 05:06.305
I'd even take oleg's penis
in a hot dog bun right now.

05:08.908 --> 05:13.345
I'll be right back.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.315
Getting on.
Please move.

05:16.317 --> 05:17.282
Getting on.
Please move.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.784
Getting on!
Please move!

05:18.786 --> 05:19.785
On!
Move!

05:19.787 --> 05:23.455
On! On!
Move! Move!

05:23.457 --> 05:25.457
I love the subway.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.192
It's the perfect place
to get out aggression.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.594
I just punched someone
in the kidney.

05:29.596 --> 05:30.996
It was me.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.264
I know.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.499
Oh, oh, bad smell,

05:34.501 --> 05:37.369
Like someone hooked up
with a falafel.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.271
It was me.
I know.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.939
Max.
Sorry.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.276
Subways, planes, and mosh pits,
I let it ride.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.610
[sighs]
I love the smell

05:45.612 --> 05:47.312
Of this fresh,
dry-cleaned blouse.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.780
[sighs]
I am so excited

05:48.782 --> 05:50.182
To be out
of that waitress uniform,

05:50.184 --> 05:52.017
And back in my chic
business clothes,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.719
And, you know,
going to my office,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.220
Where I'll probably
save the day

05:55.222 --> 05:57.155
Using some of
my wharton magic.

05:57.157 --> 06:00.792
You know, I think I like
you better without hope.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.061
Max, you know this school
is expensive, right?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.297
You're going in
with a good attitude, right?

06:05.299 --> 06:08.133
No, that's what earl's pencils
are for.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.801
Don't worry,
I'll do my best.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.370
I mean, look,
I have a book bag.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.238
The only thing my mother
ever sent me to school with

06:13.240 --> 06:15.640
Was a note that said
"check me for lice."

06:15.642 --> 06:18.510
It was so sweet of everyone
to give you that,

06:18.512 --> 06:21.680
Even though I didn't sleep
all night about it.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.215
And it looks
kind of expensive.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.383
Check for
a designer label.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.851
Why? It's the thought
that counts.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.320
Since when?

06:28.322 --> 06:29.388
Let me see it.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.589
<i>Second avenue station.</i>

06:30.591 --> 06:32.691
<i>This is second avenue.</i>

[gasps]
no, no, no, max!

06:34.027 --> 06:35.894
No, he got the book bag.
Good, max, good.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.329
Don't let go.
[sigh
s ]

06:37.331 --> 06:38.430
What if the train
starts to leave

06:38.432 --> 06:39.731
And my arms
pop off?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.433
How will I go
to pastry school?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.101
I'll be one of those people
decorating cookies

06:43.103 --> 06:44.703
With a bag
in their mouth.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.238
You are the devil.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.372
The devil.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.107
You have nothing.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.944
Pull, max, pull!
Pull it from the devil!

06:52.946 --> 06:55.847
Can't.
The devil works out.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.848
(caroline)
ooh!

06:56.850 --> 06:58.850
[both gasp]

06:58.852 --> 07:00.585
My bag.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.254
My blouse.

07:02.256 --> 07:05.490
My weed.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.930
Oh, great, look.
Class has started.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.866
My new life
already blows.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.468
Oh, look.
There's chef gorgeous.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.736
I don't want him
to see me like this.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.204
I'm gonna go to the restroom
and see

07:19.206 --> 07:21.139
If cold water can get out
any of the stain.

07:21.141 --> 07:24.443
Go, max.
But I don't have
my chef coat or book bag.

07:24.445 --> 07:25.944
I know I only had them
for a couple of hours,

07:25.946 --> 07:27.279
But it was the best part
of me.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.947
You'll do great.

07:28.949 --> 07:33.485
First, do me a favor.
Check me for lice.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.620
This course is designed
to introduce you

07:35.622 --> 07:37.756
To the skills
and techniques required

07:37.758 --> 07:39.491
In the production
of yeast bread,

07:39.493 --> 07:42.461
Short pastry doughs,
custards, pate a choux,

07:42.463 --> 07:43.628
And cake batters.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.297
Chef max,
you are late.

07:45.299 --> 07:49.267
Wait, are sure class
doesn't start at 10:17?

07:49.269 --> 07:50.469
Sorry, I got robbed
on the subway

07:50.471 --> 07:51.770
By some jerk.

07:51.772 --> 07:55.740
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm right here.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.509
I ran out of options,
and I didn't wanna

07:57.511 --> 08:00.912
Strip my way
through pastry school.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.348
That's an option?

08:03.350 --> 08:05.350
All right, chefs.
Let's focus.

08:05.352 --> 08:09.054
Did he say he wants
to "foke us"?

08:17.697 --> 08:19.097
Morning, bebe.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.365
Hi.
Oh, my god.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.533
What happened to you?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.335
And I should tell you
my doctor says

08:23.337 --> 08:26.538
I'm not allowed to hear bad news
for another month.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.440
I apologize
for my appearance.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.708
We got robbed
on the subway,

08:29.710 --> 08:31.510
And then someone hit me
with hot coffee.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.345
Then, I went to wash cold water
on the stain

08:33.347 --> 08:34.679
And somehow wound up
entering myself

08:34.681 --> 08:37.649
In a wet
t-shirt contest.

08:37.651 --> 08:41.319
Um, that's a lot of energy
for me,

08:41.321 --> 08:43.655
So I'm just gonna need
to sit here

08:43.657 --> 08:47.492
For a second
and be quiet.

08:47.494 --> 08:49.227
I know we're being quiet,
which I'm all about,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.629
But cute dogs.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.130
Oh, thanks.
They're cocker spaniels.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.532
I rescue them.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.033
You know,
people rescue greyhounds

08:55.035 --> 08:56.635
And pit bulls,
but everyone ignores

08:56.637 --> 08:57.903
The cocker spaniel.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.504
They're like,
"ew, eye goo.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.307
Shoot it."

09:02.309 --> 09:04.209
I have three cockers.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.011
Do you have
any pets?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.412
I have
a horse, chestnut.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.215
He's a thoroughbred.

09:14.654 --> 09:18.356
[sighs]
well, what can I do first?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.724
[gasps]
what's this?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.426
Why am I holding
a juice menu?

09:21.428 --> 09:23.528
Every day,
we get fresh-pressed juice

09:23.530 --> 09:24.930
For the students
and the staff.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.097
What a treat.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.532
Fresh juice is
such a scam

09:27.534 --> 09:28.900
Unless someone else
is payin'.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.536
[laughs] I'll take
the greens number three.

09:31.538 --> 09:32.537
Uh-huh, well,
put it on the list

09:32.539 --> 09:34.673
When you get
the other ones.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.708
Wait, I'm supposed
to get the juice?

09:36.710 --> 09:40.912
Oh, boy, it's like
I'm a bad news machine.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.948
Oh.
Okay.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.518
Happy to do it.
Surprised, but happy.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.553
Uh, maybe
I could change

09:48.555 --> 09:50.188
Into one of those cute
chef jackets.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.958
Oh, chef nicholas
only permits pastry chefs

09:52.960 --> 09:54.559
To wear these.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.760
But I can't meet everyone
on my first day

09:55.762 --> 09:57.195
Looking like this.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.363
I mean, it's already
bad enough

09:58.365 --> 10:00.532
I'm the juice girl.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.267
I have some workout clothes
you can wear.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.269
Don't worry.
I haven't worn them yet.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.339
But I will someday.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.311
Hi.
Hi, everyone.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.779
I'm here to take
the fresh juice orders

10:14.781 --> 10:17.148
And also to say this is not
what I came to work in.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.717
[laughs]

10:18.719 --> 10:21.219
What I came to work in
had less eyes.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.721
Caroline, welcome.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.322
How is it going
in the office so far?

10:24.324 --> 10:28.326
So great, and so not what
I came to work in.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.162
I'm usually wearing chanel,
not <i>le chien.</i>

10:31.164 --> 10:32.897
That's "dog" in french.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.735
Oh, 'cause it's "dork"
in english.

10:36.737 --> 10:40.605
Well, it is lovely to see
both of your faces.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.741
Class, we start
with the basics.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.942
No, no, no,
you in the back--

10:43.944 --> 10:45.777
Juice, miss?
Care for a juice

10:45.779 --> 10:48.246
From someone who scored 1560
on her sats?

10:48.248 --> 10:52.417
You can score more
than 500?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.119
Why the hell
are you wearing that?

10:54.121 --> 10:57.789
I didn't think your chest
could get any sadder.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.857
It's bebe's.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.191
Max, taking juice orders

11:00.193 --> 11:01.626
Is not what I came here
to do.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.663
I hear you.
I'll have the ruby red.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.997
I always keep
the edge clean,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.265
So when I'm
squeezing it,

11:07.267 --> 11:08.466
It's not gonna
have cream

11:08.468 --> 11:11.603
Popping all over
the place.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.606
Words to live by.
[laughs]

11:14.608 --> 11:17.442
I have
the opposite problem.

11:17.444 --> 11:21.479
Yo, my cream's poppin'
right now.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.647
What are you doing?
You told me

11:22.649 --> 11:24.449
You were gonna
take school seriously.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.484
It's not me.
That guy's a bad influence.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.619
Look at him.

11:27.621 --> 11:29.220
He looks like someone
who sells drugs

11:29.222 --> 11:33.024
On sesame street.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.325
You're gonna get
in trouble,

11:34.327 --> 11:35.694
And I am not wearing
a cocker spaniel

11:35.696 --> 11:37.228
So you can get kicked out
of class.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.329
Right.
I hear you.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.865
Now, where's my juice?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.702
(deke)
hey, chef max.
Check out my technique.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.705
[pastry bag farts]

11:46.707 --> 11:48.707
Awesome gross sound bonus.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.475
[laughs]

11:50.477 --> 11:52.711
Chef, if you find this
so funny,

11:52.713 --> 11:55.046
Why don't you take
a fiver?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.748
Isn't this how
your saying goes?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.216
I don't have
a saying,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.651
But if I did,
it'd be more like

11:59.653 --> 12:02.721
"eatin' ain't cheatin'."

12:06.659 --> 12:08.760
Anyone else
who finds something hilarious

12:08.762 --> 12:11.362
Can also go
into the hall.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.364
Chef max?
Nope, nothing 'ilarious.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.833
Teach on.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.868
Enough with
the dirty jokes.

12:16.870 --> 12:20.872
We are all here
to become master bakers.

12:20.874 --> 12:25.210
Master-baking is something
I work really hard at it.

12:25.212 --> 12:29.948
To be a master baker--
I'll be in the hall.

12:34.019 --> 12:37.589
Hi, I'm deke.
Did you say "freak?"

12:37.591 --> 12:39.257
Deke.
Did you say "geek?"

12:39.259 --> 12:42.927
Deke, as in
"big deke."

12:45.531 --> 12:49.868
Mine's bigger.
[laughs]

12:49.870 --> 12:51.202
We should be
lab partners.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.204
Come on.
It'll be bitchin'.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.406
Max and deke,
making cakes.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.209
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday,
with a special performance

12:58.211 --> 13:00.111
By creed.
[mimics electric guitar]

13:00.113 --> 13:01.913
Okay, now stop,
stop, stop.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.381
I am trying to be
a good student,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.716
So you just stay away
from me.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.751
You are
a bad influence.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.319
And I know I nailed that speech
'cause kids at school

13:08.321 --> 13:09.921
Used to say it to me
all the time.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.422
[watch beeps]

13:11.424 --> 13:12.791
Time to change
your tampon?

13:12.793 --> 13:14.092
Yep.

13:14.094 --> 13:17.762
Day two.
Serious flow.

13:17.764 --> 13:21.566
Killer fanny pack.
Where's your tribal poncho?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.801
Ah, keep my needles
in this.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.103
[gasps]
you're a drug addict too?

13:25.105 --> 13:26.905
God.
You are irresistible.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.606
[laughs]

13:28.608 --> 13:30.942
It's--it's insulin.
I'm a diabetic.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.311
A diabetic pastry chef.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.781
Wow, you're even more
self-destructive than me.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.616
So diabetes,
how is that?

13:38.618 --> 13:42.987
Disappointing.
I put in for syphilis.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.957
Stop laughing.
I have to carry 27 juices

13:45.959 --> 13:49.127
2 blocks wearing this.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.363
Why'd you let the dog lady
talk to you like that?

13:52.365 --> 13:55.934
She's my friend,
even in that shirt.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.208
Well, there goes
another $12.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.210
I have spent more money
dry cleaning this blouse

14:05.212 --> 14:07.545
Than I have
on health care.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.714
Health care?
You mean that box of band-aids

14:09.716 --> 14:11.850
We got at
the 99 cent store?

14:11.852 --> 14:13.952
I just have
to look good tomorrow.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.787
Today was mortifying.

14:15.789 --> 14:19.891
They called me "sad dog"
at the juice place.

14:19.893 --> 14:24.229
"sad dog,
your juices are ready."

14:24.231 --> 14:27.999
Sad dog, pick up.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.235
Can you take these to table ten?
I'm backed up on the booths.

14:30.237 --> 14:33.872
Can you? I'm kind of just
sitting here a minute,

14:33.874 --> 14:35.707
Enjoying not being told
what to do.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.976
I get enough of it
at that school.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.878
Look.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.146
If you're gonna do the martyr
thing, do it right.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.581
Stick your hand
in boiling oil

14:43.583 --> 14:45.316
Or even more painful,
binge-watch

14:45.318 --> 14:47.886
<i>Shahs of sunset</i>
<i>on bravo.</i>

14:47.888 --> 14:51.556
I need to talk to you
in the kitchen now.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.992
Leave, someone's about to get
schooled about school.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.028
This looks like it's going
to get dirty and ugly.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.864
May I film it?

14:59.866 --> 15:04.836
And if so, may I then
sell it on the internet?

15:04.838 --> 15:06.504
Look.
You can't just do this for me.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.373
You're right.
So we're out?

15:08.375 --> 15:11.075
No, we're not out, you said
you were gonna do this for me.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.610
I know,
but you just said

15:12.612 --> 15:14.012
I can't just do it
for you,

15:14.014 --> 15:15.079
And I agree.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.080
I mean,
who was I kidding?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.049
Me.
You were kidding me.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.951
I went in there thinking
I was gonna use

15:19.953 --> 15:22.520
My business skills,
and whatever hope

15:22.522 --> 15:24.222
I had of a flirtation
with frenchie mcfrench

15:24.224 --> 15:25.390
Went out the window
when he saw me

15:25.392 --> 15:26.925
Wearing that t-shirt
that said,

15:26.927 --> 15:29.193
"don't forget
to spay and neuter me."

15:29.195 --> 15:30.728
Fine, I can quit.
It's fine.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.065
It is? Really?
No, it's not fine.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.635
Who am I kidding?
Me. You were kidding me.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.903
Well, you've gotta figure out
something there

15:38.905 --> 15:40.038
To keep you interested,
because you can't go

15:40.040 --> 15:41.706
To pastry school
just for me,

15:41.708 --> 15:44.642
And I'm not gonna not go
to pastry school for you.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.810
Okay.
You're right, max.

15:45.812 --> 15:46.811
Of course I'll do it
for you.

15:46.813 --> 15:47.812
I just had
a bad day.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.314
I mean,
we both did.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.282
You lost your man's briefcase
and your drugs,

15:51.284 --> 15:56.154
And I lost my dignity
and a possible love interest.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.957
(all)
surprise!

15:58.959 --> 16:01.392
See, that's how
it's supposed to go.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.061
We got you
a new book bag.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.896
Yeah, and a new
chef's jacket.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.832
And a switchblade.

16:07.834 --> 16:12.637
Yeah, 'cause we're not buyin'
another chef's jacket.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.105
Max, you know
what this means?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.975
That I got two surprises,
and you got nothing?

16:16.977 --> 16:20.011
No, that everything's gonna
work out at that school.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.446
I mean, in the blink
of an eye,

16:21.448 --> 16:23.014
Just like this,
things can change

16:23.016 --> 16:24.315
From bad to good.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.316
Well, not totally good.
They still haven't

16:25.318 --> 16:26.951
Gotten me anything.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.620
Caroline, you didn't
not get anything.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.523
Here, your very own
pencil case.

16:34.626 --> 16:39.664
But no pencils.
My pencil dealer got busted.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.000
Aw.
Thank you, guys.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.969
I'm touched.
I was not expecting it.

16:44.971 --> 16:50.041
Really? 'cause you kinda
bullied us all into it.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.313
So that's a 780
on verbal,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.548
And a 780
on math.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.350
And with my degree
in finance,

16:59.352 --> 17:01.319
Jackass-ing around the city
getting juice

17:01.321 --> 17:03.021
Could be seen as a waste
of my talents.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.723
And as the valedictorian
at my graduation said--

17:05.725 --> 17:10.028
And I'm stealin'
from myself here,

17:10.030 --> 17:13.131
"I've seen
the future of finance,

17:13.133 --> 17:15.500
And it's us."

17:15.502 --> 17:17.135
So you want me
to get the juices?

17:17.137 --> 17:21.439
Just for today.
Please?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.877
Meringue cookies
are a simple way

17:25.879 --> 17:28.179
To practice
our pastry bag technique.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.015
Hm, interesting technique
you got going there, chef.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.317
Dude, we gotta ditch
these deadbeat partners.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.919
I'm stuck over there
with grandma.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.188
No, I'm staying
with the big guy next to me.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.356
He's not gonna get me
in trouble.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.191
He never talks.
Get outta here.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.559
Go back to your own table,
fat albert.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.094
Okay.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.595
I'm going back.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.330
And the fat albert thing
was 'cause I'm black,

17:46.332 --> 17:48.166
Not fat, right?

17:48.168 --> 17:50.935
'cause I go to the gym
two, three times a year.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.204
I hear talking,
but no baking up front.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.405
No, no, no,
you only hear baking.

17:54.407 --> 17:59.010
Just furiously
master-baking up here.

17:59.012 --> 18:01.112
The meringue needs
to have nice peaks.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.115
You are looking to make
moist, pointy peaks.

18:04.117 --> 18:08.119
I like
to pinch them.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.021
Chef, seriously,
man-to-man,

18:10.023 --> 18:12.023
We got a problem.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.891
I don't think max should be
stuck with that big guy.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.226
<i>He's not cool.</i>

18:15.228 --> 18:16.861
I was just over there,
and the only

18:16.863 --> 18:19.230
Pointy peaks he's interested in
are hers.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.532
Talkin' boobies here, chef.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.401
Chef john,
chef deke here

18:23.403 --> 18:26.070
Seems to think
you are sexually harassing max.

18:26.072 --> 18:30.074
Oh, please.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.076
If I was harassing anyone,
it would be you, chef.

18:32.078 --> 18:36.314
I mean, come on.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.417
Be right back,
big mary.

18:39.419 --> 18:44.222
You know it.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.124
Where's my juice?
It's been an hour.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.225
The mood swing elf's
getting them.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.127
Look, I'm coming
in there

18:49.129 --> 18:50.895
To flirt with chef nicholas,
and when I enter,

18:50.897 --> 18:55.800
I need you to say,
"caroline, you look amazing."

18:55.802 --> 18:57.502
No.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.637
I actually physically
can't say that.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.105
I would rather walk in there
and yell,

19:01.107 --> 19:04.308
"I have crabs,
and three of them just escaped."

19:04.310 --> 19:06.611
Call 9-1-1.
Call 9-1-1.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.514
Something's happened
to the adorable mixed-race one.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.849
Deke?

19:11.851 --> 19:13.951
He's diabetic.
He needs insulin.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.753
Has anyone here ever
administered a needle?

19:15.755 --> 19:18.856
Uh, administer means the same
thing as "shove it in," right?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.758
Good, good, good, max.
Come, come, come.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.194
Okay, uh, his syringes
are in his fanny pack.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.428
I've actually
never done this

19:24.430 --> 19:26.164
Without iron maiden
playing in the background,

19:26.166 --> 19:27.532
But I'll give it
a shot.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.801
Just put it anywhere
in my hot bod.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.770
God help us.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.438
Oh, I hate needles.
I can't look.

19:34.440 --> 19:39.143
Oh.

19:39.145 --> 19:42.847
Get it together, ladies.

19:42.849 --> 19:47.451
This is why I'm not allowed
to hold babies.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.819
Max, I think
you and deke

19:48.821 --> 19:50.555
Should be lab partners
from now on

19:50.557 --> 19:53.191
In case something like this
happens again.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.793
Is that okay?
I guess if I have to.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.295
Max?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.497
I guess
if I have to.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.332
[speaks french]

20:01.334 --> 20:04.135
What, did you not take
your insulin on purpose?

20:04.137 --> 20:07.471
I really wanted
to be your partner.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.842
Bebe, I can't find a chef jacket
anywhere in here.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.678
And I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to wear one,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.813
But I'm really cold,
and I can't walk around

20:15.815 --> 20:17.215
Like this all day.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.849
Maybe I can help.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.319
You can't stand there
wet and cold.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.254
Take my jacket.
Oh, no, no, no.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.357
You don't have--
oh, that'll work.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.825
I'm sorry about
the no shirt under,

20:27.827 --> 20:29.694
But I just get so hot
when I'm teaching.

20:29.696 --> 20:33.731
Yeah, hot.
So hot.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.833
<i>Oh mon dieu.</i>

20:35.835 --> 20:38.402
I was just giving it
to caroline.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.704
I mean, she needs
something to wear,

20:39.706 --> 20:42.373
And--and now,
she has it.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.243
Chef, I will
see you later.

20:45.245 --> 20:48.045
Caroline.

20:48.047 --> 20:51.916
Max, I think I found something
to keep me interested.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.385
This is weird.
So I'm the good student now?

20:54.387 --> 20:57.355
And you're the one
sleeping with the teacher?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.056
We're not sleeping together.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.225
Why?
Do you think he wants to?

21:01.227 --> 21:02.793
I don't know,
but you better hurry it up

21:02.795 --> 21:06.264
Before big mary
gets him.
