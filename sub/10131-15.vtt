07:41.711 --> 07:44.256
I take that back.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.256
I love it.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.383
Let's hear it.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.383
Phyllis Diller!

07:46.425 --> 07:49.219
[cheering]

07:49.261 --> 07:51.763
Well, number one, I should

07:49.261 --> 07:51.763
never have married Fang.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.098
I found that out

07:51.805 --> 07:53.098
at the wedding.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.515
He got down

07:53.140 --> 07:54.515
to the altar and asked

07:54.557 --> 07:56.559
for a blindfold

07:54.557 --> 07:56.559
and cigarette.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.896
Then he paid

07:57.852 --> 07:59.896
the organist 20 bucks

07:59.938 --> 08:03.483
to play

07:59.938 --> 08:03.483
<i>"What Kind Of Fool Am I?"</i>

08:03.524 --> 08:06.611
Then he tried to get

08:03.524 --> 08:06.611
my garter off over my head.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.030
And he did.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.784
'You wouldn't have believed

08:11.032 --> 08:12.784
the engagement ring.'

08:12.826 --> 08:14.577
He said it was

08:12.826 --> 08:14.577
a square-cut emerald.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.913
It was a Chiclet.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.707
[instrumental music]

08:19.749 --> 08:22.461
So I told Fang,

08:19.749 --> 08:22.461
"I did not lose the bumper.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.296
It's in the back seat."

08:26.214 --> 08:28.716
I can't believe I've

08:26.214 --> 08:28.716
been up here for an hour.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.135
Hour and a half.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.720
I've got to go.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.720
I've got dinner reservations.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.764
And my date is getting cold.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.434
You've been

08:35.932 --> 08:37.434
absolutely great.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.103

08:37.476 --> 08:40.103
'Phyllis Diller!

08:37.476 --> 08:40.103

08:40.145 --> 08:42.397

08:40.145 --> 08:42.397

08:44.983 --> 08:48.445

08:44.983 --> 08:48.445
There's plenty more laughs! I--'

08:48.487 --> 08:50.489
Anyway, you guys know

08:48.487 --> 08:50.489
what ticks me off

08:50.530 --> 08:52.115
more than anything else

08:50.530 --> 08:52.115
in the world?

08:52.157 --> 08:53.992
Have you guys seen

08:52.157 --> 08:53.992
the stuff they're giving away

08:54.034 --> 08:57.245
in cereal boxes? Jeez.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.123
Well, let's hear it

08:57.287 --> 09:00.123
for our own Joey Gladstone!

09:00.165 --> 09:01.541
- Yay!

09:01.582 --> 09:03.126
(Joey)

09:01.582 --> 09:03.126
'Thank you.'

09:03.168 --> 09:04.627
Thank you. Aren't we lucky?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.380
Of all the nights out

09:04.669 --> 09:06.380
of the year Phyllis Diller

09:06.421 --> 09:08.382
picked tonight

09:06.421 --> 09:08.382
to be at this club.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.051
Hey, remember when

09:09.757 --> 09:11.051
you were younger

09:11.092 --> 09:12.344
how whenever your mom

09:11.092 --> 09:12.344
got mad at you

09:12.386 --> 09:14.095
she always

09:12.386 --> 09:14.095
had the final word?

09:14.137 --> 09:16.723
And she could always change

09:14.137 --> 09:16.723
any word she wanted into a verb.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.058
'So it was kind of like'

09:18.099 --> 09:19.393
"Hey, mom,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.393
could I have a cookie?"

09:19.434 --> 09:22.521
"Oh, I'll cookie you."

09:22.562 --> 09:23.604
Thanks a lot.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.565
Hope your tractor starts.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.819
I see some people are here

09:27.984 --> 09:29.819
on dates tonight.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.405
Why is it that when someone

09:29.861 --> 09:31.405
gives your date a compliment

09:31.446 --> 09:32.697
you always

09:31.446 --> 09:32.697
take credit for it

09:32.739 --> 09:34.324
as if you had something

09:32.739 --> 09:34.324
to do with it?

09:34.366 --> 09:35.825
So it's kinda like, uh

09:35.867 --> 09:37.577
"Hey, you know your

09:35.867 --> 09:37.577
girlfriend's really a doll."

09:37.618 --> 09:41.122
"Well, thanks, I made her

09:37.618 --> 09:41.122
at home with my chemistry set."

09:41.164 --> 09:44.251
Wait, would you like to

09:41.164 --> 09:44.251
hear some impressions?

09:44.292 --> 09:46.794
Uh, some current events?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.713
Would you like

09:46.836 --> 09:48.713
to see my bridgework?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.175
[instrumental music]

09:55.678 --> 09:56.679
Joey, are you down here?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.515
(Joey)

09:56.721 --> 09:58.515
'I'm here.'

09:58.557 --> 10:01.226
We were worried. We didn't

09:58.557 --> 10:01.226
hear you come in last night.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.023
Good morning, all.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.153
Is that you

10:10.277 --> 10:12.153
inside that suit?

10:13.488 --> 10:14.948
Indeed it is.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.705
He's been moussing.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.875
Joey, you've never moussed.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.461
Please, call me Joe.

10:27.502 --> 10:31.131
It's more sophisticated,

10:27.502 --> 10:31.131
more grown-uppy.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.885
Uh, excuse me, Joe.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.720
Is there

10:35.927 --> 10:37.720
a punch line to this?

10:37.762 --> 10:39.055
Oh, there's no punch line.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.308
You see, last night

10:39.097 --> 10:41.308
was a revelation.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.394
That big break

10:41.349 --> 10:44.394
is not coming.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.813
I am going to venture

10:44.436 --> 10:46.813
into the business world.

10:46.854 --> 10:50.275
I'm going to get a real job

10:46.854 --> 10:50.275
and make some real money.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.735
I'm starting a whole

10:50.317 --> 10:52.735
new way of life.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.029
But what about your comedy?

10:55.071 --> 10:57.282
D.J., there comes

10:55.071 --> 10:57.282
a point in your life

10:57.324 --> 10:59.117
where you just have to

10:57.324 --> 10:59.117
say to yourself

10:59.159 --> 11:01.369
"I tried and I failed."

11:02.579 --> 11:04.247
I'm just glad

11:02.579 --> 11:04.247
I found this out now

11:04.289 --> 11:06.916
and not when

11:04.289 --> 11:06.916
I'm 46 years old.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.251
Whew!

11:08.293 --> 11:10.378
I am quitting comedy.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.105
Boy, I'm glad

11:27.562 --> 11:29.105
I took off work today.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.065
Otherwise, I would've

11:29.147 --> 11:31.065
missed a fascinating tour

11:31.107 --> 11:34.777
of every day care center

11:31.107 --> 11:34.777
in the northern bay area.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.030
I know, but once Joey

11:34.819 --> 11:37.030
finds a job

11:37.071 --> 11:38.573
we're gonna lose a baby-sitter.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.825
We've got to find

11:38.615 --> 11:40.825
a great place for Michelle.

11:40.867 --> 11:44.454

11:59.093 --> 12:00.554
I'll crank some music.

12:00.595 --> 12:01.804
Alright.

12:00.595 --> 12:01.804
Here we go, Michelle.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.515

12:17.696 --> 12:19.197
And go, and up.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.823
'Now go.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.823
Now breathe.'

12:20.865 --> 12:22.534
- 'Now in.'

- 'Now go.'

Excuse me, Mr. Businessman,

This little boy,

14:52.517 --> 14:55.436
he was so inspired

14:55.478 --> 14:56.937
that he hopped

14:55.478 --> 14:56.937
on his bike

14:56.979 --> 14:58.481
he pedaled down

14:56.979 --> 14:58.481
to that pawnshop

14:58.523 --> 15:01.735
traded his bike in

14:58.523 --> 15:01.735
for a guitar.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.320
And that boy..

15:04.362 --> 15:06.865
...he sat in his room,

15:04.362 --> 15:06.865
he practiced day and night

15:06.906 --> 15:08.199
night and day.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.869
Where else could he go?

15:08.241 --> 15:10.869
He had no bike.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.539
Anyway, finally,

15:10.910 --> 15:14.539
one magical day

15:14.581 --> 15:16.750
the music surged

15:14.581 --> 15:16.750
through his body

15:16.791 --> 15:19.252
into his fingertips,

15:16.791 --> 15:19.252
and he could do this.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.379
[guitar solo]

15:25.132 --> 15:27.093
And you know what?

15:27.134 --> 15:29.637
That little boy..

15:29.679 --> 15:31.180
...was me.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.975
Big surprise ending.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.397
So...what do you think?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.315
I think I'll take the guitar

15:39.439 --> 15:41.315
down to the pawn shop

15:41.357 --> 15:43.359
and get myself

15:41.357 --> 15:43.359
a new bike.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.530
I'll never be a Bracelet.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.530
I quit.

15:47.572 --> 15:51.367
D.J., you put The Bracelets

15:47.572 --> 15:51.367
together. You can't quit.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.993
I tried and I failed.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.788
I'm just glad

15:53.035 --> 15:54.788
I figured this out now

15:54.829 --> 15:57.373
and not when I'm 46.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.252
Joey.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.087
Danny!

16:03.129 --> 16:04.881
What's the matter?

16:04.923 --> 16:07.842
We've gotta come up with an idea

16:04.923 --> 16:07.842
to get Joey back into comedy.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.219
Alright.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.219
I like that attitude.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.889
What caused the sudden

16:10.261 --> 16:12.889
change of heart?

16:12.931 --> 16:15.850
Daniel, Joseph

16:12.931 --> 16:15.850
is our friend.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.435
He needs us.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.522
Besides, I hate that

16:17.477 --> 16:21.522
moussy hair of his. Come on.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.859
It's nice of you guys

16:23.357 --> 16:24.859
to come down

16:24.901 --> 16:26.861
and watch me try out

16:24.901 --> 16:26.861
some new tunes this evening.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.071
Kind of strange being here

16:26.903 --> 16:29.071
at the old club.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.950
This place has

16:29.113 --> 16:31.950
barely changed.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.786
Joe, you were here

16:31.991 --> 16:34.786
three days ago.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.036
Right.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.498
Well, welcome

16:36.078 --> 16:38.498
to amateur night.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.708
[applause]

16:40.750 --> 16:42.627
We got magicians,

16:40.750 --> 16:42.627
we got singers

16:42.669 --> 16:47.256
we got comics and by popular

16:42.669 --> 16:47.256
demand, no mimes.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.843
Let's start things off with

16:47.298 --> 16:49.843
the music of Jesse Cochran.

16:49.884 --> 16:53.429
Let's hear it!

16:49.884 --> 16:53.429
Go, Jess! Yeah!

16:53.471 --> 16:54.806
Thank you.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.806
Thanks very much, but, uh..

16:54.848 --> 16:56.474
Actually, there's

16:54.848 --> 16:56.474
been a change in plans.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.352
You see, this evening

16:56.516 --> 16:59.352
I'm going to begin my career

16:59.393 --> 17:01.228
as a stand-up comedian.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.606
Oh, he's gotta be kidding.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.817
I'd like to start off

17:03.648 --> 17:05.817
with a fast impression.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.152
It goes like this..

17:08.194 --> 17:09.863
Uh, hello, Wilbur.

17:09.904 --> 17:14.241
Uh, let's go down and visit

17:09.904 --> 17:14.241
some of my friends in prison.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.745
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:14.283 --> 17:17.745
Ed Moose!

17:17.787 --> 17:19.288
That's Mr. Ed Meese!

17:19.330 --> 17:21.791
He's stealing my material.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.251
What do you care?

17:21.833 --> 17:24.251
You quit doing comedy.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.880
That's right. I'm just

17:24.293 --> 17:26.880
a businessman enjoying the show.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.298
Why is it, you know, when

17:26.921 --> 17:29.298
you have, like a pretty date

17:29.340 --> 17:31.509
you know, and you say,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.509
"Hey, thank you, man.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.093
I got a chemistry set"?

17:35.262 --> 17:36.639
Hey, if you're gonna

17:35.262 --> 17:36.639
steal my jokes

17:36.681 --> 17:39.851
steal them right,

17:36.681 --> 17:39.851
you yahoo bird.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.435
Do you realize you're

17:39.893 --> 17:41.435
the first comic in history

17:41.477 --> 17:43.270
to heckle his own act?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.731
And what's really

17:43.312 --> 17:44.731
strange is, you know

17:44.772 --> 17:47.316
you know how your mom,

17:44.772 --> 17:47.316
she can change any, uh

17:47.358 --> 17:48.735
Sorry, your mother, your mother.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.445
She can change anything

17:48.776 --> 17:51.445
into, like, an adjective

17:51.487 --> 17:54.073
uh, um, a pronoun..

17:54.114 --> 17:55.241
...a syllable.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.743
- A verb!

17:56.784 --> 17:59.286
She can change,

17:56.784 --> 17:59.286
your mom, your mothers

17:59.328 --> 18:00.914
can change anything

17:59.328 --> 18:00.914
into a verb.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.248
It's like, you know,

18:00.955 --> 18:02.248
it's like, she comes, no, wait.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.083
I come, no,

18:02.289 --> 18:04.083
she comes home

18:04.124 --> 18:05.501
and she says to me--

18:04.124 --> 18:05.501
No, I ask her

18:05.543 --> 18:07.587
I say, "Hey, hey,

18:05.543 --> 18:07.587
mo-mother, hey, mother

18:07.628 --> 18:09.171
I say,

18:07.628 --> 18:09.171
"Hey, mom-mother

18:09.213 --> 18:11.632
"Can I, uh..

18:11.674 --> 18:13.300
You know, "hey,

18:11.674 --> 18:13.300
can I have a cookie?"

18:13.342 --> 18:16.303
and she says, "Ooh, you

18:13.342 --> 18:16.303
want some milk with that?"

18:16.345 --> 18:18.431
Then it's,

18:16.345 --> 18:18.431
"I'll cookie you!"

18:18.472 --> 18:20.892
You're killing my jokes!

18:18.472 --> 18:20.892
This is comedy murder!

18:20.934 --> 18:22.602
Oh, what? You think

18:20.934 --> 18:22.602
you could do better?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.103
This napkin

18:22.643 --> 18:24.103
could do better.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.521
Be my guest, pal.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.523
Alright, fine.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.523
Ladies and gentlemen

18:27.565 --> 18:30.276
what he's trying to say

18:27.565 --> 18:30.276
is that when your mom..

18:34.906 --> 18:36.783
I fell right into your

18:34.906 --> 18:36.783
little trap, didn't I?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.828
Break your legs, buddy.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.539
Ladies and gentlemen, the comedy

18:40.870 --> 18:43.539
styling of Joseph Gladstone.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.958
Alright.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.958
Get out of here.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.166
Jesse Cochran!

18:46.208 --> 18:48.962
Thank you!

18:46.208 --> 18:48.962
Thank you! Thank you!

18:50.588 --> 18:52.172
See, what Jesse

18:50.588 --> 18:52.172
was talking about

18:52.214 --> 18:53.967
was, you know, moms

18:52.214 --> 18:53.967
and when you were younger.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.218
My mom used to, used to

18:54.008 --> 18:56.218
chase me around all the time

18:56.260 --> 18:57.929
but she didn't really

18:56.260 --> 18:57.929
chase me with her legs.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.931
She kind of chased me

18:57.971 --> 18:59.931
with her arms.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.891
So it was two propellers

18:59.973 --> 19:01.891
coming at me all the time.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.602
It was like, "You get back here.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.602
You get back here."

19:04.644 --> 19:06.395
I'm just going, "Mom,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.395
you're gonna take off

19:06.437 --> 19:08.856
and I don't think you have

19:06.437 --> 19:08.856
clearance from the tower."

19:10.691 --> 19:12.860
I couldn't outrun my dad.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.860
My dad would start chasing me.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.112
He would start

19:12.902 --> 19:14.112
pulling his belt.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.863
It like he was

19:14.153 --> 19:15.863
starting his hips.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.907
It was, Vrrrr!

19:15.905 --> 19:17.907
"You come back here."

19:17.949 --> 19:20.326
[imitates engine]

19:17.949 --> 19:20.326
"You come back here."

19:20.367 --> 19:21.786
Oh, gosh.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.038
Every time my dad pulled

19:21.828 --> 19:24.038
his belt, he ran faster.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.582
I thought for years, well, maybe

19:24.080 --> 19:26.582
my dad's a riding lawn mower.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.335
I didn't know.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.253
Hey, did you guys ever wake up

19:29.376 --> 19:31.253
first thing in the morning

19:31.295 --> 19:32.463
and you answer the phone

19:32.505 --> 19:34.007
and you sound

19:32.505 --> 19:34.007
just like Elmer Fudd?

19:34.048 --> 19:37.343
So you're like,

19:34.048 --> 19:37.343
"Heh-woe."

19:37.384 --> 19:39.804
And you never admit to the other

19:37.384 --> 19:39.804
person that you just woke up.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.597
We always lie,

19:39.846 --> 19:41.597
and it's like, "Oh, no

19:41.639 --> 19:43.975
I've been up for hours

19:41.639 --> 19:43.975
and hours."

19:44.017 --> 19:45.518
Then you go and you

19:44.017 --> 19:45.518
look in the mirror

19:45.559 --> 19:47.311
and you look like

19:45.559 --> 19:47.311
Elmer Fudd and you're like

19:47.353 --> 19:49.605
"This is worse

19:47.353 --> 19:49.605
than I ever dreamed."

19:49.647 --> 19:51.858
[imitates Elmer]

19:51.899 --> 19:56.195
Oh, come on. Quit it.

19:51.899 --> 19:56.195
Get out of here.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.363
Thanks for

19:56.236 --> 19:57.363
all your help, guys.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.698
- Alright.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.698
- Yeah.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.908
That's where you belong,

19:58.739 --> 20:00.908
up on stage

20:00.950 --> 20:03.285
bringing joy

20:00.950 --> 20:03.285
to total strangers.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.495
Yeah, you're right.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.621
I just get so tired of waiting

20:05.663 --> 20:06.831
for that big break

20:06.873 --> 20:09.291
and the paycheck

20:06.873 --> 20:09.291
that goes with it.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.751
Take one of those jobs.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.837
Why do you think I work

20:10.793 --> 20:12.837
as an exterminator?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.421
You think I play

20:12.879 --> 20:14.421
rock 'n' roll music

20:14.463 --> 20:17.675
to support

20:14.463 --> 20:17.675
my bug-killing habit?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.093
You're right, Jess.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.720
I'm gonna find something

20:19.135 --> 20:20.720
that I could do at home.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.471
That way, I could still

20:20.761 --> 20:22.471
watch the girls

20:22.513 --> 20:25.474
make a few bucks,

20:22.513 --> 20:25.474
and still do my act at night.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.227
Ah, tonight...ha-ha!

20:28.268 --> 20:30.771
Tonight was my night.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.107
Everything worked out great

20:30.813 --> 20:33.107
and we all lived

20:33.149 --> 20:35.526
happily ever after.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.319
Thank you

20:35.568 --> 20:37.319
and goodnight, guys.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.988
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

20:37.361 --> 20:38.988
whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.115
Hold it, hold it. Whoa.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.783
Not so fast.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.620
You want a hug, don't you?

20:47.914 --> 20:51.084
Not unless I'm choking

20:47.914 --> 20:51.084
on a chicken bone.

20:51.125 --> 20:54.545
No. It seems we have a problem

20:51.125 --> 20:54.545
with one of my little nieces.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.172
We do?

20:56.214 --> 20:58.674
Jesse told me

20:56.214 --> 20:58.674
when you quit comedy

20:58.716 --> 21:00.259
D.J. quit playing the guitar.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.343
She did?

21:01.385 --> 21:02.678
Apparently the kid

21:01.385 --> 21:02.678
looks up to you

21:02.720 --> 21:05.014
for some strange reason.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.473
She does?
