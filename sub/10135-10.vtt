Okay, kids, are we ready

01:40.601 --> 01:42.269
to start Michelle's

01:40.601 --> 01:42.269
5th birthday party?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.564
(together)

01:42.310 --> 01:45.564
Yay!

01:45.606 --> 01:46.857
Wait a minute.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.276
This is a Flintstones

01:46.899 --> 01:49.276
caveman party.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.278
Cave people

01:49.317 --> 01:51.278
never say "Yay."

01:51.319 --> 01:53.280
They say ooga-ooga.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.617
How do you know

01:53.321 --> 01:56.617
they said "ooga-ooga?"

01:57.868 --> 01:59.327
Because I'm Wilma Flintstone.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.121
I was there.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.249
Now, if we all say

02:01.162 --> 02:04.249
ooga-ooga, I bet we can get

02:04.291 --> 02:07.252
the rest of

02:04.291 --> 02:07.252
my Bedrock buddies to show up.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.880
(together)

02:07.294 --> 02:09.880
Ooga-ooga!

02:11.048 --> 02:12.132
Well, ooga-ooga, everybody.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.467
Hi, I'm, uh, Barney.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.928
This is Betty.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.928
We're the Rubbles.

02:18.097 --> 02:19.556
And now, to meet the world's

02:19.598 --> 02:22.183
only housebroken dinosaur..

02:22.225 --> 02:24.019
...Dino!

02:24.061 --> 02:25.938
Boom shaka-laka-laka,

02:24.061 --> 02:25.938
boom shaka-laka-laka

02:25.980 --> 02:28.023
boom shaka-laka-laka,

02:25.980 --> 02:28.023
boom shaka-laka-laka

02:28.065 --> 02:31.068
boom shaka-laka-laka, boom!

02:32.653 --> 02:35.572
What kind of dinosaur

02:32.653 --> 02:35.572
are you?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.869
I'm a tidy-o-saurus.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.789
Please, kids,

02:42.203 --> 02:43.789
whatever you do

02:43.831 --> 02:45.624
keep the cave floor clean.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.089
Wilma!

02:54.049 --> 02:55.509
Could you give me a hand

02:54.049 --> 02:55.509
picking up these crumbs?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.511
My arms haven't evolved yet.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.014
Ooga-ooga, Dino.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.223
You know, dad, the kids

03:00.055 --> 03:02.223
really love all the props

03:02.265 --> 03:03.725
you got to borrow

03:02.265 --> 03:03.725
from the station.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.519
Ah, D.J., it was real sweet

03:03.767 --> 03:05.519
of you to dress up

03:05.560 --> 03:07.062
and play along like this.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.690
Well, just remember, when

03:07.104 --> 03:09.690
I get my driver's license

03:09.731 --> 03:13.735
I have two words

03:09.731 --> 03:13.735
for you. Red Porsche.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.196
And I have two words

03:13.777 --> 03:17.196
for you. Bus pass.

03:18.824 --> 03:22.285
Alright, alright, cave kids,

03:18.824 --> 03:22.285
uh, it's time to bring out

03:22.327 --> 03:24.371
our favorite 5-year-old

03:22.327 --> 03:24.371
cave babe

03:24.412 --> 03:26.331
Michelle Pebbles Tanner.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.584
(together)

03:26.373 --> 03:29.584
Ooga-ooga!

03:32.295 --> 03:35.924
This is Comet,

03:32.295 --> 03:35.924
my pet stegosaurus.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.261
That's not a stegosaurus.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.261
That's a Golden Retriever.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.184
You got a bad attitude.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.353
Hey, we're missing somebody.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.438
How can we be

03:48.395 --> 03:50.438
a modern stone age family

03:50.480 --> 03:52.191
without Fred Flintstone?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.949
I wouldn't do this

03:58.822 --> 04:00.949
for anyone but Michelle.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.870
Wilma!

04:05.996 --> 04:07.414
(Becky)

04:05.996 --> 04:07.414
'I'm not Wilma.'

04:07.455 --> 04:08.707
Just practicing.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.835
Jess.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.045
I think it's time.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.504
I know. Put on

04:13.087 --> 04:14.504
your little costume.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.882
You're gonna make

04:14.546 --> 04:16.882
a great preg-o-saurus.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.299
I'm gonna go get my club.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.928
No. I mean, I think it's

04:18.341 --> 04:20.928
time to have the babies.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.931
No.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.182
I think so.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.307
Get outta here.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.642
I really do.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.061
No.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.645
I think so!

04:30.687 --> 04:32.313
Get outta here.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.024
Jess, get a grip.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.316
It's happening.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.360
You know that indigestion

04:35.358 --> 04:37.360
I've been having?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
Yeah, from Joey's cocoa puff

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
omelets. I got it too.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.989
Yeah, well, my pangs

04:39.404 --> 04:40.989
of indigestion

04:41.031 --> 04:42.532
are now coming

04:41.031 --> 04:42.532
ten minutes apart.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.700
Ow. So are mine.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.079
Jess, it's not indigestion.

04:47.121 --> 04:50.124
I know it's three weeks early,

04:47.121 --> 04:50.124
but I'm going into labor.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.251
What am I goin' into?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.045
I don't know. Maybe you're

04:52.292 --> 04:55.045
having sympathy pains.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.588
Oh, no, no. Honey,

04:55.087 --> 04:56.588
this is impossible.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.965
W-we're not ready

04:56.630 --> 04:57.965
to have the kids yet.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.299
I didn't finish

04:58.006 --> 04:59.299
building the nursery.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.550
I haven't picked out the names

05:00.592 --> 05:02.010
haven't practiced

05:00.592 --> 05:02.010
the hospital drill.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.470
So you can't possibly

05:02.052 --> 05:03.470
be going into labor

05:03.511 --> 05:04.763
because I'm not ready yet!

05:05.931 --> 05:08.142
Well, ready or not,

05:05.931 --> 05:08.142
here they come.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.436
- No.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.436
- Yes!

05:11.478 --> 05:12.729
Get outta here.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.274
Jess! We've already

05:12.771 --> 05:15.274
played this game.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.567
Now, come on. I'm ready

05:15.315 --> 05:17.567
to have our babies.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.905
Have mercy!

05:21.947 --> 05:23.531
Oh, honey, we gotta

05:21.947 --> 05:23.531
get to the hospital.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.325
You know what? Hey, hoo-hoo.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.325
See, I'm going to be cool.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.369
I'm not going to be like those

05:25.366 --> 05:28.369
jerk husbands who get all crazy

05:28.411 --> 05:30.289
and go nuts because their

05:28.411 --> 05:30.289
wife's going into labor.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.999
I'm gonna be very calm,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.999
cool and collected.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.751
'Cause, hey, babe,

05:32.040 --> 05:34.751
I'm there for you. I'll pack.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.461
[snaps]

05:36.503 --> 05:38.463
Ready!

05:39.464 --> 05:41.466
Here. Grab an end.

05:41.508 --> 05:45.344
Hon, we're having a baby,

05:41.508 --> 05:45.344
not goin' to Europe.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.721
You're right.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.721
We got to lose something.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.640
Alright. What do

05:46.763 --> 05:48.640
you like better?

05:48.682 --> 05:52.853
The blue silk or say

05:48.682 --> 05:52.853
the black rhinestone?

05:52.894 --> 05:55.063
Ah, for childbirth?

05:52.894 --> 05:55.063
I'll have the blue silk.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.397
See, that's what

05:55.105 --> 05:56.397
I would've gone for.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.858
Blue silk, Huh?

05:57.899 --> 06:00.401
Jess, I've been

05:57.899 --> 06:00.401
packed for six months

06:00.443 --> 06:02.237
so let's just go.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.238
Let's go. Here we go.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.532
Okay. Kids, that's enough.

06:05.573 --> 06:06.950
That's enough. We've had

06:05.573 --> 06:06.950
a lot of fun, haven't we?

06:06.992 --> 06:11.412
I'm losing my balance.

06:06.992 --> 06:11.412
Kids. Whoo! Kids!

06:11.454 --> 06:13.456
That's enough!

06:11.454 --> 06:13.456
I mean it!

06:13.498 --> 06:16.043
Okay, okay,

06:13.498 --> 06:16.043
clubs down there, kids.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.338
Sorry, Dino, boy.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.672
I guess, having a dinosaur hunt

06:20.714 --> 06:22.216
wasn't such

06:20.714 --> 06:22.216
a hot idea after all.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.259
[laughing]

06:24.301 --> 06:26.928
Hey, everybody, this is it.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.928
Becky's ready to have the twins.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.139
- No!

06:26.970 --> 06:29.139
- Really?

06:29.181 --> 06:30.389
Get outta here.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.352
Don't start that again.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.478
It's true.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.478
I'm gonna have the babies.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.524
At my party? This is better

06:35.520 --> 06:39.524
than Chuck E. Cheese.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.276
Let's go. We've gotta

06:39.566 --> 06:41.276
get to the hospital.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.695
Here, carry this.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.695
Girls, help your Aunt Becky out.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.531
Hey, look,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.531
a dork-a-saurus.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.991
(Danny)

06:46.573 --> 06:47.991
'Out of the way, Kimmy.'

06:48.033 --> 06:49.617
Alright, let's go. Come on,

06:48.033 --> 06:49.617
come on, you guys.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.245
(D.J.)

06:49.659 --> 06:51.245
Becky's having her twins.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.997
Oh, I can help.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.997
My hamster just had triplets.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.669
There's nobody here

06:57.209 --> 06:59.669
but us kids?

07:00.670 --> 07:02.589
That could never happen.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.593
It's true.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.593
We're all alone.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.178
Aah!

07:08.220 --> 07:10.471
[all screaming]

07:12.182 --> 07:14.142
Let's eat birthday cake!

07:14.184 --> 07:16.270
Freeze!

07:16.311 --> 07:18.730
First, I need to make a wish

07:16.311 --> 07:18.730
and blow out the candles.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.234
Is anybody allowed

07:20.023 --> 07:22.234
to play with matches?

07:22.276 --> 07:24.361
(all)

07:22.276 --> 07:24.361
No!

07:25.987 --> 07:28.073
Me neither.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.073
I have to pretend.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.330
Enough already!

07:32.077 --> 07:35.330
Cut the cake.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.707
Is anybody allowed

07:35.372 --> 07:37.707
to use a knife?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.751
(all)

07:37.749 --> 07:39.751
No!

07:39.793 --> 07:42.545
I'll cut the cake.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.545
I take karate.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.713
Hi-yah!
