WEBVTT

00:13.764 --> 00:15.766
The exoskeleton's
gone rogue.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.939
We have to take it down
before it destroys
the whole academy.

00:19.940 --> 00:21.562
You're doing it wrong.

00:21.562 --> 00:23.314
Wait for my command
before you attack.

00:28.279 --> 00:29.740
Why aren't you attacking?

00:31.532 --> 00:34.705
Don't do it now.
Retreat. Retreat.

00:38.709 --> 00:40.871
Great. My team is down.

00:40.871 --> 00:43.164
My team is down!

00:43.164 --> 00:45.756
Well, I think
we can all agree

00:45.756 --> 00:48.759
that's not how you
take down an exoskeleton.

00:48.759 --> 00:51.552
Come on, give us
one more shot.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.764
I'm sorry, Chase.
This combat simulation

00:53.764 --> 00:55.386
was to test
your students' progress,

00:55.386 --> 00:56.937
and as much
as it pains me,

00:56.937 --> 01:00.141
I'm gonna have to give
your team a big "F."

01:00.141 --> 01:02.273
Who am I kidding?
This doesn't hurt at all.

01:03.854 --> 01:05.776
It's called
failure, Chase.

01:05.776 --> 01:07.608
Let me spell
it out for you.

01:07.608 --> 01:09.860
F...

01:11.572 --> 01:13.574
You know,
on second thought,

01:13.574 --> 01:15.656
you spell it out for me.

01:18.159 --> 01:21.202
The world's first
bionic superhumans...

01:21.202 --> 01:22.963
they're stronger than us.

01:22.963 --> 01:25.756
Faster. Smarter.

01:25.756 --> 01:28.129
The next generation
of the human race is...

01:28.129 --> 01:29.970
living on a bionic island.

02:06.797 --> 02:10.009
I can't believe
you guys messed up

02:10.009 --> 02:11.672
the combat simulation.

02:11.672 --> 02:14.014
What's the first thing
I taught you?

02:14.014 --> 02:17.137
Do as I say
and as I do.

02:19.059 --> 02:20.721
Good pep talk.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.315
Adam, your team's up.

02:24.315 --> 02:26.647
Okay, guys, what's
the first thing I taught you?

02:26.647 --> 02:29.109
[all] Don't be like Chase.

02:31.322 --> 02:34.865
Okay, let's do
what we do.

02:35.866 --> 02:37.368
Now!

02:39.540 --> 02:41.542
And that's what we do.

02:43.624 --> 02:45.746
That was amazing.

02:45.746 --> 02:48.339
That was even faster
than Bree's team last week.

02:48.339 --> 02:51.922
All I'm hearing is
Chase lost and I'm
a better teacher.

02:51.922 --> 02:55.556
No way. You are not
a better teacher
than I am.

02:55.556 --> 02:57.007
Calm down, dude.

02:57.007 --> 02:58.679
You've got plenty of other
things to be proud of.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.681
Once we find out
what those things are,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.062
you're gonna feel
a lot better.

03:03.644 --> 03:05.686
Look, there's still
two more tests

03:05.686 --> 03:07.808
to evaluate
your students' progress.

03:07.808 --> 03:09.690
I'm sure your team
will do better on
the next one.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.191
It's more cerebral.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.655
Yes. Me and my brainiacs
are gonna take you down.

03:14.655 --> 03:18.239
You're taunting me
and making fun of yourself
at the same time.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.701
I didn't think
that was possible.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.414
Look, both teams
will be judged

03:23.414 --> 03:25.165
on how well they handle
analytical thinking.

03:25.165 --> 03:28.919
All right, guys,
huddle up.

03:28.919 --> 03:31.712
Does anyone know what
analytical thinking is?

03:33.384 --> 03:36.637
I'd say you got
the second round locked up.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.979
[squishing sound]

03:51.151 --> 03:53.694
Ah! Gross!

03:58.819 --> 04:00.160
Hey, Leo.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.742
What are you doing?

04:01.742 --> 04:04.495
Just grabbin'
a glass of milk...

04:04.495 --> 04:06.417
to go with my pie.

04:08.829 --> 04:10.210
Eww!

04:13.374 --> 04:15.175
What is going on here?

04:15.175 --> 04:16.587
This is disgusting.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.839
Yeah. Welcome
to my world.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.721
Adam and Chase live like
a couple of farm animals.

04:21.721 --> 04:23.844
At least farm animals
lick themselves clean

04:23.844 --> 04:25.306
every once in a while.

04:26.647 --> 04:29.770
I'll just have to clean
this whole place up myself.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.271
Hand me that towel.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.024
Um, I wouldn't
use that one.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.397
- Why not?
- Because it's moving.

04:36.397 --> 04:37.858
[screams]

04:41.742 --> 04:43.574
Listen up, roomies.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.746
You've got another person
living with you now.

04:45.746 --> 04:47.998
You need to respect that.

04:47.998 --> 04:50.831
I have been scrubbing
our room for the past six hours.

04:50.831 --> 04:53.874
- I've got pruney fingers.
- Why didn't you
just wear gloves?

04:53.874 --> 04:56.757
I did.

04:56.757 --> 04:58.969
I don't care which
one of you is making the mess.

04:58.969 --> 05:00.631
Just stop.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.980
Now who's makin' a mess?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.984
Okay, everybody
gather round and listen up.

05:13.984 --> 05:16.897
It is time for
the second challenge.

05:16.897 --> 05:19.069
Everybody to your
work stations.

05:26.537 --> 05:28.369
Each time will have
60 seconds

05:28.369 --> 05:31.121
to diffuse their
3-D virtual explosive device.

05:31.121 --> 05:33.794
This is gonna
be so easy.

05:33.794 --> 05:35.796
Like taking
dynamite from a baby.

05:37.297 --> 05:40.300
Even though
the explosives are fake,

05:40.300 --> 05:43.804
the potential for humiliation
is very real.

05:45.135 --> 05:48.769
Don't forget to work
together as a team.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.815
Your 60 seconds starts...

05:54.815 --> 05:56.737
now.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.400
Okay, guys,
all you have to do

05:59.400 --> 06:00.611
is cut one of
these wires.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.982
But choose carefully,

06:01.982 --> 06:04.695
because it's
a life or death decision.

06:05.946 --> 06:09.199
Whose favorite
color is red?

06:09.199 --> 06:12.122
Whose favorite
color is blue?

06:12.122 --> 06:14.625
Don't look at me.
I like 'em both.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.959
Okay, guys, we've
been through this
a million times.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.591
Once you assessed
the detonator's

06:20.591 --> 06:22.052
internal architecture,

06:22.052 --> 06:24.384
remove the Dorris plate,
expose the motherboard,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.717
clip the primary command node,
and the firing mechanism

06:26.717 --> 06:28.469
will deactivate.
Got that?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.274
[frustrated grunt]

06:34.274 --> 06:36.977
Great thinking.

06:36.977 --> 06:38.649
We'll cut the wire that
combines red and blue.

06:38.649 --> 06:39.780
Gold.

06:51.742 --> 06:52.793
Yeah!

06:54.795 --> 06:56.747
Congratulations on
defusing the device.

06:56.747 --> 07:00.631
And more impressively,
not knowing that red
and blue make purple.

07:03.754 --> 07:05.506
Don't worry.
We have plenty of time.

07:05.506 --> 07:07.307
- Five seconds.
- Out of my way.
You're all useless!

07:07.307 --> 07:10.641
Three, two...

07:10.641 --> 07:12.012
No, wait.
I need more...

07:15.225 --> 07:16.767
Time?

07:19.319 --> 07:22.322
Don't worry, Chase.
I'm not gonna say
that I'm disappointed.

07:22.322 --> 07:24.735
[whispers] Just know
I'm thinking it.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.832
[horrified shriek]

07:31.832 --> 07:34.244
What have you done?!

07:34.244 --> 07:35.786
What are you
talking about?

07:35.786 --> 07:37.337
Yeah. We haven't
done anything.

07:37.337 --> 07:40.040
I had a feeling
you might say that,

07:40.040 --> 07:42.633
which is why
I have this.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.635
That's right, savages.
Security footage.

07:44.635 --> 07:46.797
Let's take a look.

07:46.797 --> 07:48.799
Put anything on a screen,
I'll watch it.

07:51.351 --> 07:53.684
Where is it?
Where is it?

07:56.016 --> 07:57.898
Bree?!

08:06.657 --> 08:09.369
Ugh. Now that's a lady.

08:10.911 --> 08:13.163
[laughs]

08:13.163 --> 08:15.576
Oh, that's a big one.

08:15.576 --> 08:17.918
She's a keeper.

08:17.918 --> 08:20.711
She's an animal!

08:20.711 --> 08:22.713
No, that's an animal.

08:24.835 --> 08:26.717
Oh, look, he grew.

08:30.721 --> 08:32.803
Wrong, wrong.
Terrible. Bad.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.975
Ew, no. Do it again.

08:34.975 --> 08:37.347
Chase.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.400
Do you ever think you might
be losing these challenges

08:41.400 --> 08:42.903
because you're
going about it all wrong?

08:42.903 --> 08:45.445
No.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.357
You're reprimanding them.

08:47.357 --> 08:48.909
You're not teaching them.

08:48.909 --> 08:51.822
Maybe try a little
teamwork like Adam did.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.205
That's Professor Adam.

08:55.205 --> 08:57.748
Adam, you're not
a professor,

08:57.748 --> 08:59.539
and for the last time,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.371
you are not a better
teacher than I am.

09:01.371 --> 09:02.833
Do you not see
the glasses?

09:05.796 --> 09:08.669
All I'm saying is,
you might get a better
response from your team

09:08.669 --> 09:11.261
if you let them
be more involved
in the decision making.

09:14.174 --> 09:15.676
Wait, you're serious?

09:17.808 --> 09:19.890
There's one last test,

09:19.890 --> 09:21.732
which means your team
has one last chance

09:21.732 --> 09:24.234
to prove themselves,
and for you to prove yourself.

09:26.777 --> 09:29.399
You wanna borrow
my glasses?

09:35.786 --> 09:37.618
Okay, that's it.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.750
I am not about to lose
to Adam and his meatheads

09:39.750 --> 09:42.002
three times in a row.

09:42.002 --> 09:44.254
We have to show them
that we're better than them.

09:44.254 --> 09:46.296
The best way to do that
is to manipulate

09:46.296 --> 09:49.419
your bionic chips
so I can control
your every move.

09:49.419 --> 09:50.971
Yeah, yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

09:50.971 --> 09:52.843
Isn't that cheating?

09:52.843 --> 09:54.174
Well, let me just
nip this in the bud.

09:54.174 --> 09:56.476
Yes. Yes, it is.

10:04.184 --> 10:07.227
All right, I've
figured out a way
to use my override app

10:07.227 --> 10:08.649
to control
all of you at once,

10:08.649 --> 10:10.530
which means
no more mistakes,

10:10.530 --> 10:12.863
because when I think
of something, you'll do it.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.365
Too bad I can't
do that to everyone.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.287
All right,
let's link up.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.668
There. Let's test it out.

10:28.749 --> 10:30.671
Why aren't you doing
what I'm thinking?

10:33.633 --> 10:35.635
I don't get it.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.758
Why isn't this working?

10:37.758 --> 10:40.310
Great. Now you're mocking me.
Very funny.

10:44.024 --> 10:45.475
Wait a minute.

10:53.443 --> 10:54.985
[all] Gah!

10:54.985 --> 10:56.737
My override app must not
be able to control

10:56.737 --> 10:58.408
this many people.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.990
Instead of doing
what I'm thinking,

10:59.990 --> 11:01.992
you're just mirroring
what I do.

11:01.992 --> 11:03.744
We can't make it through
the test like this.

11:03.744 --> 11:06.496
Let's go, Chase.
Test's about to start.

11:06.496 --> 11:07.958
He's gonna know
we're cheating.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.711
What do we do?

11:10.711 --> 11:11.842
Quit it!

11:17.347 --> 11:19.970
Aha! Busted!

11:19.970 --> 11:21.722
You're the slob.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.975
Leo, I was aiming
for the trash can.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.608
You mean the one
that's not on my forehead?

11:28.608 --> 11:32.112
I have a whole video
of you trashing this place.

11:32.112 --> 11:34.775
If you have a video,
why are you trying
to catch me in the act?

11:34.775 --> 11:38.118
Because this is
more dramatic.

11:38.118 --> 11:39.780
What happened to you?

11:39.780 --> 11:41.081
I don't know.

11:41.081 --> 11:42.823
I guess, for the first
time in my life,

11:42.823 --> 11:44.704
I actually have
some freedom,

11:44.704 --> 11:46.376
and I'm enjoying it.

11:46.376 --> 11:47.707
This is not freedom.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.290
This is a cesspool of
filth and girl garbage.

11:50.290 --> 11:53.673
Look, if you were stuck in
a basement for your whole life,

11:53.673 --> 11:55.715
you'd wanna
let loose, too.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.838
Besides, you're
the new guy here,

11:57.838 --> 11:59.679
so if you have a problem
with my mess,

11:59.679 --> 12:01.261
go live with the rest
of the students in the dorm.

12:01.261 --> 12:03.263
I am not going anywhere.

12:03.263 --> 12:06.436
And you know what?
Two can play at this game.

12:11.151 --> 12:12.853
What are you doing?

12:15.355 --> 12:17.778
Hey, that's where
I sleep.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.319
Not tonight.

12:23.203 --> 12:25.455
This blanket
doesn't seem warm enough.

12:25.455 --> 12:26.957
You know what it needs?

12:26.957 --> 12:32.042
A nice layer of
month-old chili.

12:37.217 --> 12:38.758
Looks delicious.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.221
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:41.221 --> 12:43.053
I have to take out
the trash.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.065
Oh, yeah?

12:58.198 --> 13:01.031
You know the best part
about living on an island?

13:01.031 --> 13:04.704
All the fresh seafood
that's been rotting in the sun.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.458
Okay, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

13:10.410 --> 13:12.752
Luckily, I'm standing
next to your capsule.

13:12.752 --> 13:14.214
No!

13:15.836 --> 13:19.679
Welcome to
the third and final challenge.

13:19.679 --> 13:24.054
[cheesy game show
music plays]

13:24.054 --> 13:26.306
Adam Davenport,
you have an opportunity

13:26.306 --> 13:29.559
to lead your team
to a third victory.

13:31.141 --> 13:33.023
Chase Davenport,
you and your team

13:33.023 --> 13:35.065
have one last chance
to save yourself

13:35.065 --> 13:36.736
from a lifetime
of ridicule

13:36.736 --> 13:39.439
from your brother...
and me.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.742
And Bree.
She's not here,

13:42.742 --> 13:46.246
but I'm pretty sure
she'd want in on
some of this.

13:46.246 --> 13:47.998
This last test
will challenge

13:47.998 --> 13:50.620
both your mental
and physical prowess.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.452
So there will be
a brief warm-up period

13:52.452 --> 13:54.454
of brisk exercise.

13:54.454 --> 13:56.086
No movement!

13:58.128 --> 14:01.131
I mean,
stretching's overrated.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.632
What's the worst
that can happen?

14:02.632 --> 14:04.804
Torn hamstring.
Pssh!

14:04.804 --> 14:06.726
Okay, suit yourself.

14:11.561 --> 14:13.523
Guys... ooh!

14:15.235 --> 14:18.738
Guys, Mr. Davenport
can't find out
I'm controlling you.

14:18.738 --> 14:21.942
Just keep quiet
and follow my lead.
Got it?

14:21.942 --> 14:23.944
Why aren't you nodding?

14:23.944 --> 14:25.615
Oh. Right.

14:27.988 --> 14:30.750
Deep in the bowels
of the academy...

14:30.750 --> 14:34.374
is a high-tech maze,
complete with obstacles

14:34.374 --> 14:37.377
that I control
with this tablet.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.379
Electric walls,
ninja stars,

14:39.379 --> 14:41.501
and my own
personal favorite,

14:41.501 --> 14:43.883
flaming balls
of fury!

14:46.766 --> 14:49.719
The first team
to complete the maze wins,

14:49.719 --> 14:51.891
but before we start,
I need to see both mentors.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.773
Adam, Chase, over here.

14:55.515 --> 14:57.017
Guys, give us a second?

14:58.018 --> 14:59.819
- Guys!
- I got this.

14:59.819 --> 15:01.321
Back it up,
nerd herd.

15:05.075 --> 15:07.657
For this challenge,
it's just the students.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.449
What?! No!

15:09.449 --> 15:11.791
Teams, I hope you've studied
the maze carefully.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.583
If not, too bad.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.168
Ah!

15:18.168 --> 15:19.669
Don't worry, Chase.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.301
We can track their progress
from over here.

15:21.301 --> 15:23.673
Adam, your team is
off to a great start.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.506
Chase, your team
hasn't moved at all.

15:28.308 --> 15:31.641
Ha! Looks like you guys
are gonna lose again.

15:31.641 --> 15:34.224
Not if I can help it.

15:52.572 --> 15:54.784
What? They keep losing.

15:54.784 --> 15:56.666
I have to do
my "good luck" dance.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.590
Are you done yet?

16:12.552 --> 16:14.934
I could go all night.

16:14.934 --> 16:16.766
I lost my sense of smell
hours ago.

16:19.149 --> 16:22.692
Which is why I can
bury you

16:22.692 --> 16:26.866
in Adam's dirty,
sweaty workout clothes.

16:26.866 --> 16:28.738
No, stop!

16:28.738 --> 16:32.452
This has gone
far enough.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.667
There has to be a way
that I can still stay messy,

16:37.667 --> 16:39.459
and you won't
have to clean up after me.

16:41.331 --> 16:43.253
Maybe there is.

16:44.964 --> 16:46.296
Great idea, Leo.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.128
This is gonna
work out perfectly.

16:48.128 --> 16:49.299
Yes, it is.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.511
Okay, I'm finished.

16:55.805 --> 16:58.188
That was awesome.

16:58.188 --> 17:00.690
I'm not hungry, but let's order
more stuff we can blow up.

17:05.565 --> 17:07.567
[panting]

17:09.529 --> 17:10.740
Chase, I can't believe it.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.912
Your team
is actually winning.

17:14.954 --> 17:16.746
Adam, what are you doing?

17:16.746 --> 17:18.367
I don't know,
but it's working for Chase.

17:25.755 --> 17:29.219
Let's see. How can
I make this more interesting?

17:29.219 --> 17:31.761
I know. Flash bombs.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.726
Oh, not good enough.

17:36.726 --> 17:40.560
Better try
my flaming balls of fury.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.641
[groaning and crying]

17:41.641 --> 17:43.813
Burn, baby, burn!

17:50.690 --> 17:52.952
Chase, your team
is almost out.

17:52.952 --> 17:56.956
Oh. Great.
Go, team.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.702
Almost there.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.206
Almost there.

18:06.206 --> 18:07.707
Almost there.

18:07.707 --> 18:09.669
Almost there!

18:09.669 --> 18:11.711
They made it!

18:11.711 --> 18:13.713
[bells ringing]

18:13.713 --> 18:16.426
Ah, come on!

18:16.426 --> 18:18.808
Let's bring 'em up.

18:22.892 --> 18:25.145
Wait. Why aren't
they celebrating?

18:28.898 --> 18:31.531
Yeah! Whoo!
Oh, yeah!

18:31.531 --> 18:33.823
We won, we won, we won...

18:33.823 --> 18:36.286
Wait a minute.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.288
Something's goin' on here.

18:38.288 --> 18:41.291
Yeah. It's called
failure.

18:41.291 --> 18:44.834
No, it's not that.

18:44.834 --> 18:47.297
I know that really well.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.302
What are you doing?

18:56.636 --> 18:59.809
Professor Adam
is about to conduct

18:59.809 --> 19:03.813
a science experiment.

19:03.813 --> 19:06.145
- [yells]
- [all yelling]

19:07.647 --> 19:09.859
Just as I thought.

19:09.859 --> 19:11.571
This proves they
messed with something

19:11.571 --> 19:13.733
that caused
something to happen, I think.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.199
Chase, care to explain?

19:29.669 --> 19:33.213
Cheating? What
were you thinking?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.794
I don't know.

19:34.794 --> 19:36.135
I guess I just
got carried away.

19:36.135 --> 19:37.677
Chase, these tests
were designed

19:37.677 --> 19:39.389
to measure your students'
progress,

19:39.389 --> 19:41.511
and instead, you turned it
into a competition

19:41.511 --> 19:42.722
between you
and your brother.

19:42.722 --> 19:44.684
- Which I won.
- And handily.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.436
That's not the point.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.438
If you'd been less
focused on beating Adam,

19:48.438 --> 19:50.109
and more focused on
being a good teacher,

19:50.109 --> 19:52.692
your team would've had
the tools to win for themselves.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.654
Okay. You're right.

19:54.654 --> 19:57.196
But just in case,
can I have a new team?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.909
- No!
- Aargh!

19:59.909 --> 20:03.583
Fine. I'll work on
becoming a better teacher.

20:04.874 --> 20:08.788
Good. Now there's just
one last thing for you to do.

20:08.788 --> 20:10.790
Don't worry.
I'll make it up to my team.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.632
Oh, I know you will.

20:12.632 --> 20:14.634
But your punishment
for cheating is gonna be

20:14.634 --> 20:16.386
to find out
what it feels like

20:16.386 --> 20:18.007
to have someone control you
with the override app.

20:18.007 --> 20:20.510
What? Who?

20:20.510 --> 20:22.221
Me.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.307
Go ahead, Adam.

20:27.307 --> 20:28.768
Don't mind if I do.

20:29.769 --> 20:33.773
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

20:33.773 --> 20:35.355
This is fun.

20:35.355 --> 20:37.527
You do realize
you're hurting yourself too?

20:37.527 --> 20:38.778
Oh, yeah.

20:38.778 --> 20:42.121
Now we'll see
who's hurting who.

20:44.414 --> 20:46.746
Cut it out.
Quit it.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.078
I'm not gonna stop
until you do.

20:56.966 --> 20:59.969
Wow! This place
is spotless.

20:59.969 --> 21:01.431
Whatever you're doing,
it's working.

21:01.431 --> 21:03.182
Thank you.

21:03.182 --> 21:04.724
[whirring]

21:04.724 --> 21:05.765
What's that noise?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.847
Oh, that's
our new housekeeper.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.444
You turned
my incredibly expensive

21:14.444 --> 21:15.605
piece
of combat technology

21:15.605 --> 21:17.607
into a walking
vacuum cleaner?

21:17.607 --> 21:19.609
He doesn't just vacuum.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.821
He sorts laundry,
he washes dishes,

21:21.821 --> 21:24.824
he even does windows,
right, Exo?

21:31.621 --> 21:33.793
See? Spotless.
