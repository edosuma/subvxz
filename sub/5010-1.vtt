23:27.006 --> 23:29.709
Muddy...
Son of a bitch.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.579
Hold it.
What's he
paying you?

23:32.612 --> 23:34.914
Uh...10, uh...

23:34.947 --> 23:38.685
10 grand?
Oh, that cheap ass.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.687
All right.
I got a better
deal for you.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.821
I'll double it.
I'll pay you 20

23:41.854 --> 23:44.056
if you go back there
and do him.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.059
Uh, you want us
to do a guy?

23:47.093 --> 23:47.727
No way.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.929
Um, I don't know,
butt-head.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.898
That is
a lot of money.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.468
Maybe if we close
our eyes and pretend
he's a chick--aah!

23:55.502 --> 23:58.437
[Sirens]

24:01.674 --> 24:02.642
Damn.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.811
You two wait
right there.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.246
Uh...huh
huh huh.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.881
I'm ready
for love.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.450
Yeah! I don't
believe this.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.859
Hmm.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.796
Yeah, Las Vegas.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.566
Give me the number
for dream America tours.

24:26.599 --> 24:27.600
Right.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.902
Uh, huh huh huh,
uh, huh huh.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.839
Yeah. You got
a bus leaving today?

24:32.872 --> 24:34.106
Where's it going?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.175
Washington, D.C.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.578
5 minutes? Perfect.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.112
Give me 2 tickets.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.014
Wait, butt-head.
You always go first.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.217
Damn it, beavis,
we've never done
this before.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.819
Aah!

24:46.853 --> 24:49.121
Oh, uh...
Huh huh...

24:49.155 --> 24:51.924
Wanna...you know...
Uh, huh huh...

24:51.958 --> 24:53.125
Do it?
Heh heh.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.794
Hey,
we're finally
gonna score!

24:54.827 --> 24:56.028
Do it?

24:56.062 --> 24:56.829
Ow!

24:56.863 --> 25:01.067
You guys wanna...
Score? Oh, ho ho.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.168
Damn it!

25:02.201 --> 25:05.171
Ow! Cut it out!

25:05.204 --> 25:06.272
You wait here.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.273
Bunghole!

25:07.306 --> 25:09.609
Damn it!
Ow! Aah!

25:09.642 --> 25:12.845
[Punching sounds]

25:15.648 --> 25:18.918
[Rapid beeping]

25:25.057 --> 25:26.292
Aah!

25:26.325 --> 25:28.527
Uh...huh
huh huh.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.632
Aah!

25:32.665 --> 25:33.733
Uh...huh
huh huh.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.201
No!

25:38.204 --> 25:40.306
Aah! Aah! Aah!

25:40.339 --> 25:41.307
Ahem!

25:41.340 --> 25:42.074
Aah!

25:42.108 --> 25:43.943
Don't wear
yourselves out,
boys.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.913
Save some energy
for me.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.748
Uh, huh huh huh.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.950
Hm hm, heh heh.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.754
This is it, beavis.
We're finally
gonna score.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.056
Heh heh...
Thank god.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.792
Oh, yeah. We're gonna do it,
all right.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.694
Uh, huh huh huh...
Heh heh heh...

26:01.728 --> 26:03.229
Heh heh,
oh, yeah!
Uh, huh huh...

26:03.262 --> 26:04.230
Ahem!

26:04.263 --> 26:07.667
Boys...boys...

26:07.700 --> 26:09.001
Boys!

26:10.402 --> 26:13.205
First, you have to do
a little job for me.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.242
Would you like to do
a little job for me?

26:16.275 --> 26:17.877
Here's what it is.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.247
I want you to take the bus
to Washington, D.C.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.049
That's all.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.285
Then when you get there,
I'll be waiting.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.155
You're gonna make
a whole lot of money,

26:29.188 --> 26:31.624
and I'm gonna give you
everything.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.626
Uh, huh huh huh.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.695
Hm hm, heh heh.

26:35.728 --> 26:36.829
Until then...

26:36.863 --> 26:39.699
Keep your pants on.

26:39.732 --> 26:43.870
Now, your bus is
downstairs waiting,
so get going.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.838
Uh, huh huh huh...

26:45.872 --> 26:48.107
Hm hm, heh heh...

26:51.878 --> 26:53.245
Let's go!

26:53.279 --> 26:54.981
On 3!

26:56.749 --> 26:58.918
This is gonna be cool.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.053
Can't wait. Heh heh.

27:06.425 --> 27:07.293
Ow.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.396
Get outta there, beavis.
I want the window.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.931
No, butt-head!

27:11.964 --> 27:14.801
Why don't ya
take turns?

27:14.834 --> 27:16.235
Hey, butt-head,
check it out.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.037
It's that slut
from the plane.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.273
Oh, why,
it's you two.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.843
How'd you do
in Las Vegas?

27:23.876 --> 27:25.244
Um, we didn't
score yet.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.948
Oh, well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.417
Me, I took
a beating.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.384
Cool.

27:32.418 --> 27:37.056
So that's why
I'm bussing it
across America.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.291
I'm so glad
you're here.

27:39.325 --> 27:43.229
Jim, Jim! I want you
to meet two nice boys.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.831
Uh...oh...

27:44.864 --> 27:46.298
This is Travis
and Bob.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.234
What's your
last name, dear?

27:48.267 --> 27:49.869
Uh, head.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.772
My first
name's butt.
Uh, huh huh.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.073
Hm hm, heh heh.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.378
Agent Flemming, atf.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.181
So, are you gonna
tell us where it is

28:02.214 --> 28:05.051
or will I have to
have agent hurly
over there

28:05.084 --> 28:06.853
give you another
cavity search?

28:06.886 --> 28:09.856
Mmm. Is that a promise?

28:09.889 --> 28:12.458
Look, Mrs. Scum,
we know who you are.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.860
Tell her, bork.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.428
Dallas grimes,
married to muddy grimes.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.698
You run a mom-and-pop
arms smuggling ring.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.969
Mmph. You got
my bad side.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.837
3 days ago,
you pulled a job

28:24.871 --> 28:27.774
at the army
research facility
in Hadley, Nevada,

28:27.807 --> 28:30.076
where you stole
the x-5 unit.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.478
We happen to know
you had the unit
with you

28:32.511 --> 28:33.645
when you
checked in here,

28:33.679 --> 28:37.283
so why don't you be
a good girl and tell
us where it is?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.886
You gonna charge me
with anything?

28:39.919 --> 28:40.887
I didn't think so.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.521
You wanna
let me go now,

28:42.554 --> 28:45.925
or wait till
my lawyer files
a wrongful arrest?

28:45.958 --> 28:47.126
We got nothing,
chief.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.527
We tore
the place apart.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.897
We can only legally
hold her another
couple of hours.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.099
Damn it!
Cut her loose.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.367
Where is that damn unit?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.270
Uh, huh huh huh.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.072
We're in
Washington.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.974
Yeah, yeah.
We're gonna
score now.

29:02.008 --> 29:05.978
Actually, son, we're
at the hoover dam.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.981
Um, no, no.
We're in Washington!

29:09.015 --> 29:12.852
Yeah. We're
gonna score now!

29:14.854 --> 29:17.189
Tour guide:
Over 40,000 tons
of concrete

29:17.223 --> 29:20.192
were used in
the construction
of the hoover dam.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.262
From top to bottom,
the dam is 51 stories.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.464
It has a maximum capacity
for generating

29:25.497 --> 29:28.267
wow. Really?
2.074 megawatts
of electricity,

29:28.300 --> 29:31.470
but on the average,
it generates about
25% of that.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.839
I'll be damned.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.006
Can anybody tell me

29:34.040 --> 29:36.408
how much energy it takes
to power Las Vegas?

29:36.442 --> 29:38.310
Um, yeah, I just
have a question.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.147
Is this a god dam?
Hm hm, heh heh.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.214
Huh huh huh.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.416
You know,
god damn.
You know?

29:44.450 --> 29:47.253
Guide: If you'll
follow me this way.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.589
This is dumb.
Let's go find
that chick.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.025
Yeah. Enough
of this crap.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.594
Whoa. Check it out,
butt-head--TV!

29:55.627 --> 29:57.263
Cool.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.900
I gotta hit
the head.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.601
Can you get me
some coffee?

30:02.634 --> 30:03.903
All right.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.040
Talk to me, bork.

30:08.074 --> 30:09.909
Chief, we found
a witness

30:09.942 --> 30:12.244
that says he saw
2 teenagers leaving
Dallas' room

30:12.278 --> 30:13.379
shortly before
we arrived.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.015
Did you give him
a full cavity search?

30:16.048 --> 30:18.217
Uh...the witness?

30:18.250 --> 30:20.452
Yes. You can never be
too careful, bork.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.922
Sir, I didn't
really think it
was necessary.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.924
You see, we have
a picture of them

30:24.957 --> 30:26.225
from the elevator
security cam.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.927
Here. Have a look.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.128
What the hell?

30:29.161 --> 30:32.031
They look like
a couple of kids,
chief.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.633
Don't you realize
what kids today
are capable of?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.402
Don't you read
the papers?

30:36.435 --> 30:37.836
What the...

30:39.571 --> 30:41.240
Damn it!

30:41.273 --> 30:43.475
All they have
is these shows
about water.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.243
Yeah, really.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.079
They need
some shows
about fire.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.949
Uh, what are you
doing, beavis?

30:49.982 --> 30:52.651
Something's wrong
with my butt.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.254
Your butt sucks.

30:55.287 --> 30:58.057
Hey, how come
there's no sound?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.259
Uh...I'll fix it.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.462
[Klaxon blaring]

31:03.495 --> 31:04.897
Uh...

31:07.399 --> 31:10.269
Yeah, yeah!
There you go.
Louder! Louder!

31:10.302 --> 31:14.640
Uh, huh huh...
Hmm...Huh huh...

31:14.673 --> 31:17.109
Uh...

31:17.143 --> 31:20.947
Mas-ter-a...

31:20.980 --> 31:22.281
Masturbation?

31:22.314 --> 31:24.350
Uh, huh huh huh!

31:34.026 --> 31:35.561
You know,
I'll tell you what.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.297
It doesn't get
any better than this.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.266
This here is
god's country.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.433
Unspoiled and--

31:41.467 --> 31:44.203
aaaaah!

31:44.236 --> 31:46.005
Uh...

31:46.038 --> 31:48.975
I think I found
the remote.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.445
What the hell's
going on?

31:57.416 --> 32:00.152
[Crowd panicking]

32:00.186 --> 32:02.288
I swear, that's
all I know.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.156
They got on
the tour bus.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.158
It was probably
heading west.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.960
Uhh! Please...

32:07.994 --> 32:09.928
I'm gonna kill 'em!

32:12.198 --> 32:14.133
That was boring.

32:14.166 --> 32:18.170
Yeah, yeah.
Just the same thing,
over and over again.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.505
Uh, wait a minute.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.173
We can't leave
Washington

32:21.207 --> 32:22.708
till we find
that chick.

32:22.741 --> 32:26.178
Oh, we're
a long way from
Washington, Bob.

32:26.212 --> 32:29.315
This is
the hoover dam.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.583
Dam. I'll
be damned.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.619
Heh heh.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.559
You boys better show up.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.232
Do you see
what I see, bork?

32:46.265 --> 32:48.467
I see it.
I just don't
get it.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.736
You got half the state
looking for you.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.171
How do you get away?

32:52.204 --> 32:53.172
Cut the power!

32:53.205 --> 32:54.306
Damn right.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.408
Bork, we're dealing
with real pros here.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.177
My opinion: Terrorists.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.179
What's the scoop on
that stolen unit?

33:00.212 --> 33:02.081
Well, sir,
it's not good.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.715
Roll the tape.

33:03.749 --> 33:07.486
The x-5 unit is
a new top-secret
biological weapon--

33:07.519 --> 33:11.190
a man-made virus,
the deadliest
known to man.

33:11.223 --> 33:14.093
It could wipe out
5 states in 5 days.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.361
Here's what happened

33:15.394 --> 33:18.497
when it was tested
on a group of
army recruits.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.499
Look at these guys,
chief.

33:20.532 --> 33:24.503
This thing
is a veritable
doomsday device.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.737
Jesus jumped-up
Christ!

33:25.771 --> 33:28.640
If this were
to fall into
the wrong hands...

33:28.674 --> 33:31.210
It gets worse.
The unit wasn't
finished.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.644
It has a flaw--
the casing.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.114

make an announcement

57:39.990 --> 57:41.926

Why are we getting

It's time to go, son.

we were gonna score!

not gonna happen!

We're just gonna get old
like these people!

59:10.080 --> 59:11.215

probably scored!

Hey, I'm warning you!
Sit down!

59:13.183 --> 59:15.219
It's, like,
this chick's a slut!

59:15.252 --> 59:17.021
And look at this guy!
He's old!

59:17.054 --> 59:18.823
But he's probably scored
a million times!

59:18.856 --> 59:20.057
Oh, yeah.

59:20.090 --> 59:22.059
But not us!
We're never gonna score!

59:39.276 --> 59:40.244
Book 'em, bork.

59:40.277 --> 59:42.847
You don't have
anything on us,
and you know it.

59:42.880 --> 59:45.315
Oh, I don't, huh?
How about lewd conduct?

59:45.349 --> 59:46.951
Maybe indecent exposure.

59:46.984 --> 59:48.385
Here's what's
gonna happen.

59:48.418 --> 59:51.055
One of you is going to make
a deal and get me the unit.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.357
The other can spend
the next 60 years in jail.

59:53.390 --> 59:55.826
Heh. That's where
you're wrong, boy.

59:55.860 --> 59:58.228

59:58.262 --> 59:58.996
he stole the unit!

59:59.029 --> 01:00:01.198
Said he put it
in some kid's pants.

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:04.635

it doesn't
do a body good

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.279
to get
all worked up.

01:00:15.312 --> 01:00:19.850

help you relax.

and smuggled out
of the country during
this conference?
