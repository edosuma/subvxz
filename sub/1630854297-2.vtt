WEBVTT

00:21.021 --> 00:23.291
Denise, come out here.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.493
Look, there's no sheets
on the bed.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.827
Why is the bed
upside down?

00:30.964 --> 00:32.700
My mother wanted me
to go to med school.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.169
The reason I didn't...
Let me guess.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.738
You hate the sight of blood. Exactly.

00:37.838 --> 00:41.109
Mm-hmm.
So this dummy decides
to become a cop instead.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.476
Makes sense.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.011
You have to talk to me first.

00:44.112 --> 00:46.046
Tell me everything
that you said to him.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.348
Hey.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.617
You okay out there?
Uh, yes, Detective.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.720
And what about you?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.422
You ladies okay?

00:54.522 --> 00:55.556
Yes.
Yeah.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.425
Did you call in 911?
It was me.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.493
Perhaps being
a little overzealous.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.894
I don't think they were
being overzealous.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.830
It looks like Jack Woltz's bed
in there.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.098
Who?
Jack Woltz.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.199
Godfather made him
an offer he can't ref...

01:05.299 --> 01:06.434
Forget it.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.801
I'll need to speak
to you all later.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.702
Okay?

01:08.802 --> 01:10.003
I'm gonna need the name

01:10.104 --> 01:11.739
of the guest who was
staying in this room.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.041
Have you determined that a crime
occurred on the premises?

01:14.142 --> 01:15.876
Well, I don't think
the guest had a paper cut.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.711
Agreed, but it's...

01:17.811 --> 01:19.680
not necessarily a crime, is it?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.382
Well, there's nobody in there.
There's no towels.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.083
There's no sheets.
There's a pool of blood.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.119
Could be someone was murdered
and carried out.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.121
Could be, maybe not.
Look, you can cooperate
and give me the name.

01:27.221 --> 01:30.324
Or you could do this the hard
way and not give me the name.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.959
I'm sorry,
hotel policy forbids me

01:32.059 --> 01:33.794
from sharing the names
of guests.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.698
Hey, Sarge.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.967
Uh, boss wants to see you ASAP.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.936
You're getting transferred.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.508
Eddie. No. Eddie!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.143
We had a deal.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.344
We did?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.379
At the hospital.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.680
You said,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.582
"Is there anything
I can do for you?"

01:54.682 --> 01:57.050
And I said, "You can let us stay
in the same precinct."

01:57.151 --> 01:59.853
Yes.
So, then why are you
transferring him?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.289
Just because you asked
for a wish

02:01.389 --> 02:03.191
does not mean that I granted it.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.692
I am not your fairy godmother.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.727
No, you're not.
Where are you sending him?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.462
To the Intelligence Bureau.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.167
I cannot

02:13.267 --> 02:14.702
believe you are doing this.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.370
I honestly don't know
what to say.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.339
Just say thank you.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.807
Eddie.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.509
I'm staying right here.
She recommended

02:21.609 --> 02:23.043
that I be the new
Field Intelligence Sergeant

02:23.143 --> 02:25.045
for the 2-9.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.549
You did?

02:29.717 --> 02:32.420
Oh, my God. Um...

02:33.321 --> 02:34.655
Oh, my God.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.424
Thank you.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.591
Oh, hey, ho, no.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.560
Don't even think about that. No.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.061
Absolutely not.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.731
What? No. Nothing.
Of course not.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.733
That's never happening.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.539
Captain.
Just wanted to clarify.
Thank you.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.541
Goodbye. Go.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.581
And they let him walk
without bail.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.250
That's it on my end, boss.
Nothing else, sir.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.485
Garrett, hang back a minute.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.861
Thank you.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.799
Any knock on your door
about that thing?

03:18.899 --> 03:22.470
Not yet,
but only a matter of time.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.137
Anyone knock on yours?

03:24.238 --> 03:26.039
All quiet on my front, too.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.310
Well, I guess we'll answer
the door when the knock comes.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.645
Yes, but we should know
what we're going to say

03:31.745 --> 03:33.046
before we have to say it.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.748
You want me
to draft a statement?

03:34.848 --> 03:36.617
I already did.
Oh, great.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.051
I'll take my usual pass, then...

03:38.151 --> 03:39.953
It's not necessary,
it's just one sentence.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.523
But it might need
some amplification.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.259
One simple declarative sentence.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.627
Clear as a bell.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.507
That's it?
That's it.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.509
And then yelled every reporter
at once...

04:01.609 --> 04:03.777
I won't be taking questions.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.014
Okay, are we at least
going to give

04:07.114 --> 04:09.049
the parties concerned
a heads-up?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.252
Would we normally give them
a heads-up?

04:12.353 --> 04:13.621
No, but this isn't normal.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.755
It has to be.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.390
Wishing won't make it so.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.159
No, but actions will.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.228
That is all for now.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.327
Did he say why?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.197
I'm afraid not.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.767
But he's in his office now,
if you want to stop by.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.802
Is that the plan,
that you deliver the blow

05:01.902 --> 05:03.871
and then send me in there
for consoling?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.539
He doesn't know
I delivered the news.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.074
I'm definitely sticking my neck
out here.

05:07.174 --> 05:07.975
Why?

05:08.075 --> 05:09.943
Because I couldn't not.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.582
Well, normally,
of course I would stop by

05:14.682 --> 05:16.149
to hash things out,

05:16.249 --> 05:18.051
but "Commissioner Raegan will
not be making

05:18.151 --> 05:21.855
an endorsement in the race for
Manhattan District Attorney."

05:24.091 --> 05:26.860
There's nothing to hash.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.859
Perfect, thank you.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.093
Got the subpoena.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.161
When will people learn?

06:01.261 --> 06:02.530
You make our life difficult,

06:02.630 --> 06:03.997
we're only gonna make yours
even more difficult.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.567
Well, that manager was
probably just doing his job.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.069
I mean, he would lose his job
if he coughed up

06:09.169 --> 06:10.771
whoever's hotel room
that was.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.740
Okay, but now he's gotta
choke on a subpoena,

06:12.840 --> 06:15.142
which means we're gonna get
the name of the guest anyway.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.710
And on top of that,
now we get access

06:16.810 --> 06:18.512
to the surveillance camera footage.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.282
Uh...

06:22.382 --> 06:23.484
Who's that?

06:23.584 --> 06:26.420
That's Dr. Nigh Nigh.
Doctor <i>what?</i>

06:26.520 --> 06:28.221
His real name is Dr. Knight
with a "K,"

06:28.321 --> 06:31.391
but everyone just calls him
Dr. Nigh Nigh.
Who's "everyone"?

06:31.492 --> 06:34.695
Instagram, talk shows, Page Six.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.229
He's famous? What did he do,

06:36.329 --> 06:37.698
write a children's book
or something?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.033
It's Dr. Nigh Nigh
'cause he's a sleep doctor.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.334
Oh.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.604
What the hell is a sleep doctor?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.839
Do you know the single most
important thing you can do

06:45.939 --> 06:47.875
for your health is
get a good night's sleep?

06:47.975 --> 06:50.678
No. You told me a month ago
it was no carbs, eat bacon. No.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.946
It is scientifically proven.
Uh-huh.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.315
Sleep is more important
than diet and exercise.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.850
It's the first pillar.

06:56.950 --> 06:57.918
The first pillar.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.520
That sounds like
you're in a cult.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.855
He has over a million followers.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.724
That's a very big cult.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.593
Tell me, how many
of those followers

07:05.693 --> 07:07.528
does he tell they'll get
a good night's sleep

07:07.628 --> 07:08.962
by sleeping with him?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.464
He's a really good guy,

07:10.564 --> 07:12.666
and he's happily married.
So then what

07:12.766 --> 07:16.704
the hell's he doing with dirtbag
defense attorney Perlmutter?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.339
Detective Reagan.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.373
Pleasure to see you.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.575
You, too, Counselor.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.076
And this is my partner
Detective Baez.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.013
Well, let me
introduce you to...
I'm a huge fan.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.280
Your book changed my life.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.116
Ah, that's really amazing.
Thank you.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.584
<i>Change Your Sleep,
Change Your Life.</i>

07:30.684 --> 07:32.986
Exactly.
So, to what do we owe

07:33.086 --> 07:34.154
the displeasure, Counselor?

07:34.254 --> 07:35.155
I just want to say
right off the bat

07:35.255 --> 07:36.890
that nothing's wrong.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.026
No crime has been committed.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.494
We are here making

07:40.594 --> 07:42.462
a good-faith gesture.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.898
Okay, so what crime did your
client not commit, then?

07:44.998 --> 07:46.634
I know that you are looking
for the individual

07:46.734 --> 07:48.468
who stayed at the Greenwich
last night.

07:48.569 --> 07:52.339
We would like to come forward
on that matter.
That was him?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.577
Yes, it was me.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.980
Mm-hmm.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.817
Change your sleep,
change your life.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.488
First off, I would like to

08:08.589 --> 08:11.124
sincerely thank you
for your time and...

08:11.224 --> 08:12.693
discretion with this matter.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.928
Discretion?

08:15.028 --> 08:16.196
What I'm about to tell you--

08:16.296 --> 08:18.532
I'm a married man, you see.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.902
Mm-hmm. Very happily,
from what I've been told.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.837
Yes. Very much so.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.238
So that was your wife
you were with

08:25.338 --> 08:26.540
at the hotel, then?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.609
No.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.544
My wife is out of town
this week.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.547
I see.
Who were you with?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.383
A friend.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.918
This friend have a name?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.253
I don't know.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.922
So a close friend.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.691
Detective, can we please
do without the commentary?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.693
My client is here
of his own accord.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.295
Okay, so we're looking for
a get-out-of-jail-free card

08:48.395 --> 08:49.429
<i>and</i> discretion. Ooh.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.131
Get out of jail?

08:51.231 --> 08:52.800
I-I didn't commit
any crime.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.635
Detective, please. Okay.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.103
Then let's cut
to the chase.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.005
Where'd all the blood
come from in the hotel room?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.711
I was slashed by a knife.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.881
Looks like a bandage to me.
I don't see any slash.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.823
Okay.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.725
What hospital did you go to?

09:17.825 --> 09:20.427
I stitched the wound myself.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.830
Right. Because discretion.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.231
So your friend
with no name cut you?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.232
No, no, it wasn't her.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.268
Someone came to the door,

09:28.368 --> 09:29.937
and they were banging on it
pretty good.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.040
And when I opened it,
a man came rushing in

09:33.140 --> 09:34.307
screaming and yelling.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.976
Who?
I don't know.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.344
I-I guess her pimp.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.912
It all happened
in an instant.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.615
The next thing I know
I'm slashed and I'm bleeding.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.717
And the girl?
I don't know.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.185
I guess she left with him.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.588
Okay. Do you have
a description of this guy?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.423
He called me soon after.
I put him at about six feet.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.861
I was hoping he might answer, Counselor.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.397
I think he was about six feet,
uh, 200 pounds.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.366
Wearing a baseball hat.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.934
Look, I never saw his face.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.237
I don't suppose you have
a "contact number"

10:04.337 --> 10:05.605
for your friend?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.207
They met at a hotel bar.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.183
I'm sorry, I don't.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.353
Didn't think so.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.231
Sergeant Reagan. Welcome.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.333
I'm your Intelligence liaison,
Lieutenant Flemming.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.301
Pleasure to meet you, boss.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.006
What is this place?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.173
The Black Room.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.113
This is where any and all
top secret

10:46.213 --> 10:48.281
or confidential conversations
will take place.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.151
Meaning pretty much every
conversation you and I have.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.020
Please take a seat.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.527
Your wheels are turning.
That's good.

11:00.627 --> 11:04.164
Less good, you're
showing your cards.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.432
I'm sorry, what?

11:05.532 --> 11:06.566
You're an Intelligence
officer now;

11:06.666 --> 11:08.401
your face is your mask.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.572
Okay. Uh, right.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.776
So this room is
surveillance-proof?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.644
That surprises you.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.679
We're at One PP,
surrounded by other cops.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.614
Cops, not Intelligence officers.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.683
Unless otherwise approved,

11:23.784 --> 11:25.953
we don't discuss cases or
share any information

11:26.053 --> 11:27.120
with other cops.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.590
Is that gonna be a problem?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.592
Well, it's just I am
who I am.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.127
Look, I understand your father's
the commissioner,

11:34.227 --> 11:35.562
but even he doesn't have
the authority

11:35.662 --> 11:36.696
to tell us what we do
in this...

11:36.797 --> 11:38.298
That's not what I meant.
Trust me,

11:38.398 --> 11:40.700
my father would stop me cold
on the first syllable.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.835
So what's the issue?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.603
Well, I'm married to a cop.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.272
Officer Edit Janko.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.242
So can I talk about
my work with her?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.745
No exceptions.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.415
Your security clearance,
new ID card.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.250
That'll give you access
to this floor.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.124
Sign for security clearance.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.298
We'll be communicating
through secure message,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.500
but from time to time
I ask you to come up here

12:13.600 --> 12:14.935
and brief me in person.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.804
Okay. How often do we meet?

12:16.904 --> 12:18.705
As often as I like.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.410
There something on your mind?
Please share.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.846
It's just my whole career,
my entire experience

12:25.946 --> 12:29.049
has been centered around
cops helping cops.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.584
The time to walk away is now.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.653
No, that's-that's not it.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.656
I'm not, I'm not looking
to walk away, boss.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.694
Sergeant Reagan...

12:41.795 --> 12:43.663
you're taking your
first baby steps

12:43.763 --> 12:45.332
into the clandestine world.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.368
In that world,
not everyone is

12:48.468 --> 12:49.803
who they appear to be.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.738
Sometimes the guy behind
the counter at a bodega

12:51.839 --> 12:53.807
is just a guy
behind the counter.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.342
But sometimes
he's much more than that.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.344
So if I learn that type
of information,

12:57.444 --> 12:59.079
doesn't it make sense
for me to share it

12:59.179 --> 13:00.680
with the other cops
in my precinct?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.715
Aren't we all working together?

13:02.816 --> 13:04.617
What if it's your C.O. instead?

13:04.717 --> 13:06.319
My C.O.?

13:06.419 --> 13:10.323
She's not... but maybe she is.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.694
My point is, knowing
someone is compromised

13:14.794 --> 13:17.364
and using that knowledge
for our benefit

13:17.464 --> 13:19.900
is often better than
making the collar.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.069
Save that for the beat cops.

13:23.871 --> 13:27.107
We operate at
an elevated level.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.542
My wife's not compromised.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.378
I'm sure that's so.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.283
But it's not a risk
we're willing to take for you.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.691
Sir, your father is here. Abigail.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.495
You've got some nerve, Francis.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.197
Thank you, Baker.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.833
I could have been
in a meeting, Pop.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.903
The hell with your meeting.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.872
Well, shot in the dark,
this is about Erin.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.875
Who came to me in confidence,
and I swore to her

14:01.975 --> 14:03.643
I wouldn't say a word to you.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.745
So right off the bat,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.315
you break my word,
I break your nose.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.783
And I'm the only one left
who would do it.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.552
Loud and clear.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.521
So what is this horse crap?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.856
It's the right call, Pop.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.027
Hanging your only daughter
out to dry is the right call?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.329
You've been up on this
high floor too long.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.364
Look, I understand
why you're upset.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.699
It's not me you should be
worried about.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.768
And I'm sure Erin is
upset, too,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.370
but she'll get over it.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.173
And maybe in time she will
even come to understand it.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.741
You didn't even have
the decency

14:34.841 --> 14:36.643
to tell her yourself.
I can't do that.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.111
Why the hell not?!

14:38.211 --> 14:39.679
Because if I wouldn't do it
for somebody else,

14:39.779 --> 14:41.448
I can't do it for her.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.716
Oh, Mary and Joseph.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.386
I would have thought
after sitting in that chair

14:46.486 --> 14:47.554
for all these years,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.489
you would have lightened up
a hair.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.692
We do the job differently.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.361
You can say that again.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.862
My hand to God,

14:55.963 --> 14:57.364
there is no way in hell

14:57.464 --> 15:00.567
I would have cut bait on you
like you're doing to Erin.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.569
I am not cutting bait on her.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.205
Dress it up all you like
in ethics or good governance,

15:05.305 --> 15:08.408
but damn it, it's exactly
what you're doing.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.178
We agree to disagree.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.987
You hurt her, Francis.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.323
I know.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.358
You gonna make it right?

15:26.759 --> 15:29.096
It is right.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.948
Look at her.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.051
Nothing like the type
that would be hanging out

15:51.151 --> 15:54.854
with that street thug pimp
that your star crush described.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.557
He's not my star crush. Okay.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.061
I got an idea.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.429
Where you going?

16:02.529 --> 16:05.598
I'm gonna see an old friend.
You wanna come with?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.436
<i>It's funny, isn't it?</i>

16:09.536 --> 16:11.271
Everything is for sale
these days,

16:11.371 --> 16:13.906
and anything can be delivered
right to your doorstep.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.844
You could courier a bag
of weed right now, but still

16:17.944 --> 16:21.681
we demonize and criminalize
God's greatest gift: lovemaking.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.616
I'm not sure
you can still call it love

16:23.716 --> 16:25.218
if you have to swipe
a credit card for it.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.587
For some that's half the fun.
Look, we just

16:27.687 --> 16:30.823
need to know if this is one
of your girls or not.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.761
She looks familiar.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.329
Okay.
Do you got a name?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.430
Not for you.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.199
What's her name?

16:39.299 --> 16:40.633
Oregano.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.102
Okay, look,

16:42.202 --> 16:43.736
you don't want us to
have to call Vice, do you?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.605
She looks familiar.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.574
That's the best I can do.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.213
Okay.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.382
Hey, I've been thinking.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.617
Uh-oh.
Why uh-oh?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.719
Well, bad things happen
every time you say

16:59.819 --> 17:01.421
you've been thinking
instead of just

17:01.521 --> 17:02.589
saying what you're thinking.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.023
Well, that's not true.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.992
Well, forget it.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.660
Clearly I don't have
your support.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.296
Come on, I was just
playing with you. Tell me.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.998
I'm worried about
your new job.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.901
I know. Me, too.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.369
I think I should
talk to McNichols.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.771
Absolutely not.
What's the big deal?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.673
I'll just explain
the situation

17:20.773 --> 17:22.942
and see if she might be
willing to change her mind.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.078
Are you under the impression
that you and your C.O.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.613
have a good rapport?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.881
Well, when you ask it
like that,

17:28.981 --> 17:31.184
maybe not.
Definitely not.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.886
Well, where does that leave us?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.322
I mean, you're just gonna
take this job

17:35.422 --> 17:37.424
that renders you a mute
in our relationship,

17:37.524 --> 17:39.392
and we just have to
hope it doesn't

17:39.492 --> 17:42.362
drive a wedge between us.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.764
I haven't figured it out yet.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.502
Okay?
Yeah.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.404
You really can't be here
right now.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.072
My children will be home
any minute.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.841
Well, then, just give us your
friend's contact information

17:54.941 --> 17:56.876
and we'll be on our way.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.213
Dad?
Hey, hon.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.315
Everything okay?

18:03.350 --> 18:06.619
It's nothing. It's just
an insurance claim.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.795
I really need you to go now.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.600
We got this off the surveillance
camera at the hotel.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.137
We're the only ones
who've seen it so far.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.638
You threatening my client?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.740
We gotta ID this woman
if we're gonna solve the case.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.176
We came forward voluntarily.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.478
You came forward because
you wanted discretion.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.380
You knew we were gonna
get a subpoena, which means

18:33.480 --> 18:35.348
you knew we'd get access
to the surveillance videos,

18:35.448 --> 18:37.350
and it would show him.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.618
Basically you wanted
to keep your client's name

18:38.718 --> 18:39.919
out of the papers.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.888
That's not true.
Of course it's true.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.591
You know if he ends up
on Page Six it's good night

18:44.691 --> 18:46.159
to the doc's sleep empire.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.495
Maybe her pimp...
There's no pimp.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.398
This isn't some gal you met
on 42nd Street back in the '80s.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.533
She's a $2,000-a-night call girl

18:53.633 --> 18:55.935
who you ordered
from Arianna.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.273
What do you want?
The truth.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.709
It's the only way we're gonna
keep him out of the papers.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.178
Can I have the night
to talk to my client?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.214
Sure.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.249
Sleep on it.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.291
Garrett wants to pop in.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.531
Is there any possible way

19:24.631 --> 19:26.766
we could put that off
till tomorrow?

19:26.866 --> 19:29.135
He said not urgent
but important.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.704
I have no idea
what that means.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.741
Let's have him.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.546
Remember the 1988
presidential debate?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.281
Okay, now I'm confused.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.049
Is this urgent or important?

19:43.149 --> 19:45.818
Dukakis's fate was sealed
on the first question.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.721
His entire campaign over
before it started.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.089
Yeah, he blew the question.
He was asked

19:50.189 --> 19:51.824
would he support
capital punishment

19:51.924 --> 19:54.561
if his wife was raped
or murdered. Exactly.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.129
He said no,
and then he proceeded

19:57.230 --> 20:01.067
to give a long, cold
and dispassionate rationale

20:01.167 --> 20:03.270
on why he was always against
the death penalty.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.839
Yes, exactly.
But this is not that.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.608
He never even mentioned
his wife.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.610
It was as if he was
talking about

20:10.710 --> 20:12.545
anyone else in the world. Garrett,

20:12.645 --> 20:17.116
it is very kind of you to worry
that I might be perceived

20:17.216 --> 20:18.585
as unfeeling.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.520
It is unfeeling.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.054
She's your daughter.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.991
I know your family is
the third rail around here,

20:25.091 --> 20:27.026
and has been since
the day we met, but...

20:27.126 --> 20:29.629
No buts.
Yes, there is a but.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.264
Because what you're
setting out to do is

20:31.364 --> 20:33.600
a public relations nightmare,
and I can't just stand...

20:33.700 --> 20:36.803
The way you just couldn't
not tell Erin?

20:39.806 --> 20:41.808
And there it is.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.811
And yes.
Exactly like that.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.713
It's like the signs
at the airport.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.316
If you see something,
say something.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.587
I'm afraid you have
no choice here, Garrett.
You're wrong.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.788
I do.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.156
I get to speak my mind,

20:57.256 --> 20:58.958
and I'm telling you
not to do this.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.259
You will be crucified.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.961
By treating my daughter
no different

21:02.061 --> 21:03.363
than I would
any other candidate?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.765
She is different than
any other candidate.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.166
She's your daughter.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.637
And every media outlet
and citizen of this city

21:10.737 --> 21:11.904
is gonna see it that way.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.272
Then so be it,
'cause I'm not gonna

21:13.373 --> 21:14.574
start pandering now.

21:14.674 --> 21:15.742
This isn't pandering.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.844
It's basic human nature.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.313
A father loves and supports
his daughter

21:20.413 --> 21:22.715
to the Nth degree,
hell or high water.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.917
I do, Garrett.
Then come out and say it.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.455
I am. In my own way.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.893
Thank you for caring.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.581
Did you know,
according to Dr. Nigh Nigh,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.148
the day after
Daylight Savings Time,

21:56.248 --> 21:58.718
the country as a whole sees
an increase in heart attacks

21:58.818 --> 22:02.655
by 14%, but the day after
we set the clocks back,

22:02.755 --> 22:04.290
and we get an extra
hour's sleep,

22:04.391 --> 22:08.127
heart attacks decrease by 20%.
Told you.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.262
Sleep is the first pillar
of health.

22:10.363 --> 22:12.131
Who knew?
So now you like him?

22:12.231 --> 22:14.133
Not even a little bit.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.802
One o'clock.

22:15.902 --> 22:16.869
What's one o'clock?

22:16.969 --> 22:20.373
One o'clock.
<i>My</i> one o'clock.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.912
Oh, uh, Arianna, to what
do we owe the pleasure?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.313
Don't act so surprised.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.148
It's not like I had a choice.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.249
I don't give you
what you want,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.385
you shut me down.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.321
Oh,

22:35.422 --> 22:37.123
the young lady who
spent the night night

22:37.223 --> 22:40.393
with, uh, Dr. Nigh Nigh?

22:40.493 --> 22:43.029
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

22:43.129 --> 22:44.464
Nothing?

22:44.564 --> 22:47.600
I mean, that happened,
but nothing else.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.502
So absolutely nothing
at all happened

22:49.602 --> 22:50.937
out of the ordinary that night?

22:51.037 --> 22:54.373
No. We had a few drinks,
we spent some time together,

22:54.474 --> 22:55.508
I went on my merry way.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.143
No pimp crashing
through the door

22:57.243 --> 22:58.277
brandishing a knife?

22:58.377 --> 22:59.779
Pimp?
Yes.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.881
No. Look, what I do
for a living is

23:01.981 --> 23:05.652
out of the ordinary,
but no, nothing like that.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.254
You know, Dr. Knight had
a pretty severe slash

23:08.354 --> 23:09.722
across his chest.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.425
So severe that he had to
give himself stitches.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.193
I don't know anything
about that.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.762
Must have happened
after I left.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.831
So you never saw anyone
slash him or attack him

23:18.931 --> 23:21.033
or assault him, nothing?
Like I said,

23:21.133 --> 23:24.504
we did our thing,
I went about my business.

23:26.773 --> 23:27.807
Okay.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.877
<i>The journey has just begun.</i>

23:30.977 --> 23:34.714
This move to Intelligence
is just another rung

23:34.814 --> 23:36.115
in the ladder.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.451
That's what I need to
talk to you about, Pop.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.352
I'm just--

23:40.453 --> 23:43.155
I'm not sure about this move.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.991
I'm not sure
it's a good fit.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.093
It's a great fit.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.028
It's not.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.731
What's the problem?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.535
Oh, you can't talk about it.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.203
You don't like wearing
a muzzle.

23:57.303 --> 24:01.407
I love my job, but I love
my marriage, too.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.712
The modern-day marriage,

24:05.812 --> 24:08.481
with all its delicate intricacies.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.782
In this new job,

24:09.882 --> 24:11.283
I can't talk to her
about anything.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.519
I can't even talk to you about

24:12.619 --> 24:13.853
what I can't talk to her about.

24:13.953 --> 24:18.525
I've carried my share
of secrets, believe me.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.859
And how'd you manage it at home?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.962
I roamed the earth
with the dinosaurs, Jamie.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.998
Your grandmother would no more
have asked me about

24:26.098 --> 24:28.167
my day on the beat
than I would ask her about

24:28.267 --> 24:29.836
how to darn a sock.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.971
The good old days.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.307
Neither is right,
they're just... different.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.909
Mm-hmm.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.846
A man has to live
in his own time.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.581
And I don't want to
keep things from her,

24:41.681 --> 24:45.618
but I'm gonna have to
if I want to keep this job.

24:45.718 --> 24:46.986
Do you like the job?

24:47.086 --> 24:49.756
I think it could be
really interesting.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.693
You will never forgive yourself

24:53.793 --> 24:56.696
unless you heed
your true calling.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.732
You're saying I should stay.

24:59.832 --> 25:03.102
I'm saying you need to
nail down

25:03.202 --> 25:05.872
what your calling is.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.285
I shouldn't be here.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.187
Garrett, I'm fine, I swear.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.589
You don't need to say a word.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.857
I know that about you,
believe me.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.694
Okay then.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.796
I'll see you around.
What he did was wrong,

25:29.896 --> 25:31.463
and I told hm so. Garrett...

25:31.564 --> 25:33.332
But it didn't move him
an inch.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.101
You should go.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.336
And...

25:37.436 --> 25:39.706
you were never here.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.851
<i>You kept me waiting
all morning, Perlmutter.</i>

25:51.951 --> 25:54.353
You're lucky I didn't cut bait
on you already.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.823
Sorry. Pressing business.
Uh-huh.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.424
More pressing than
keeping your client's name

25:58.524 --> 25:59.792
out of the papers?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.762
My client gave you an honest
and accurate account

26:02.862 --> 26:05.097
of the events in question.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.834
Any additions or subtractions
would be untruthful.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.202
Well, it's interesting because
we had an escort come in here

26:10.302 --> 26:12.371
and give us the complete
opposite story.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.607
To each their own.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.442
It doesn't concern you?
He said, she said.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.078
Would you like to know
what she said?
Not particularly.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.579
Not even if it
incriminates your client?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.915
If that were the case,
Detective, my client

26:23.015 --> 26:24.751
would already be
in handcuffs.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.954
Instead, he's having lunch
at the Carlyle.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.422
Well, you know my next move.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.524
About that...

26:33.325 --> 26:34.226
Formal notice.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.062
If that photo you showed us

26:36.162 --> 26:37.163
appears in the media,

26:37.263 --> 26:38.564
we will be holding you

26:38.665 --> 26:40.332
and the NYPD accountable

26:40.432 --> 26:42.334
to the tune of $10 million.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.435
You're gonna sue me?

26:43.535 --> 26:44.503
Only if you do
something stupid.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.838
And a copy of that was sent to

26:45.938 --> 26:47.606
the police commissioner's
office as well.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.741
You think that scares me?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.209
I think that stops you.

26:55.514 --> 26:56.816
What was that?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.517
I thought we had this one
all wrapped up.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.352
So did I.
What just happened?

27:00.452 --> 27:04.223
Dr. Nigh Nigh's lawyer
just put me in a sleeper hold.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.272
Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.573
No, no, that's fine.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.775
Sit down.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.144
Okay.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.246
Something wrong?

27:27.346 --> 27:28.815
No.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.852
Yes, but...

27:32.952 --> 27:35.654
You really are not
the easiest person

27:35.755 --> 27:37.724
to have a conversation with,
are you?

27:37.824 --> 27:40.559
No, I'm not.
But you did ask to see me.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.494
Didn't you? Okay.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.396
Now you're having
second thoughts?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.799
Okay.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.035
Is this about you
and Sergeant Reagan again?

27:49.135 --> 27:50.436
What?

27:50.536 --> 27:51.938
My perfect solution
to your problem turned out

27:52.038 --> 27:53.906
not to be so perfect?
No.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.842
Not by a long shot.

27:55.942 --> 27:58.677
So, you wanted to talk to me
about it, but while you were

27:58.778 --> 28:02.148
sitting here waiting for me,
all the different versions of

28:02.248 --> 28:05.017
how badly this could go started
to run through your head?

28:05.117 --> 28:07.419
Whoa. You're good at this.
Not really.

28:07.519 --> 28:12.391
I just trust my instincts,
and I get out of my own way.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.627
Well, that's good advice.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.734
Wait. That's what
you are telling me to do,

28:21.834 --> 28:23.602
isn't it?
Ah.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.504
Got it.

28:25.604 --> 28:28.174
Great. Thank you.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.142
Hey, Janko?

28:31.043 --> 28:34.313
You and Sergeant Reagan--
I know that the version

28:34.413 --> 28:36.615
of you two around here
may no longer be on the menu,

28:36.715 --> 28:39.886
but there are other choices

28:39.986 --> 28:43.790
that might end up being
just as good, maybe better.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.797
Hey. You got a minute?

28:50.897 --> 28:52.298
How you holding up?

28:52.398 --> 28:55.768
Well, Garrett Moore came by
to see me.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.070
Oh, yeah? He come
bearing gifts?

28:58.170 --> 29:01.140
Well, he came to tell me
that he's got my back, but

29:01.240 --> 29:03.475
that and a subway token...
You know,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.444
your old man ain't budging
for nobody. Yeah.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.014
Not even his only daughter.
What I'm supposed

29:08.114 --> 29:11.417
to say here is, "Don't go
feeling sorry for yourself."

29:11.517 --> 29:13.119
But you're not going to?
No.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.888
I'm afraid you're gonna put my
you-know-whats in a vice grip.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.489
I don't know why I'm surprised.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.359
I mean, it's completely
consistent with who he is. But

29:20.459 --> 29:22.895
a part of you thought it would
be different with you. I get it.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.196
Yeah, and-and I know

29:24.296 --> 29:25.664
he would do the same thing
with my brothers.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.199
No argument here.
I just...

29:27.299 --> 29:30.136
just for once wish

29:30.236 --> 29:32.238
he could stop being the
commissioner and just be my dad.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.372
You know,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.207
you're like Charlie Brown, thinking

29:35.307 --> 29:38.544
that one day Lucy's actually
gonna let him kick the football.

29:38.644 --> 29:41.513
Great. So I should look forward
to a lifetime of face-plants?

29:41.613 --> 29:42.815
Look, your old man

29:42.915 --> 29:44.316
is not a tough nut
to crack at all.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.852
It's just
that all of you see him

29:45.952 --> 29:47.753
through rose-colored glasses.

29:47.854 --> 29:49.555
What's that supposed to mean?

29:49.655 --> 29:50.823
Does the guy

29:50.923 --> 29:53.592
do it by the book
every single time?

29:53.692 --> 29:55.027
Absolutely.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.263
But does the guy
always have an angle?

29:57.363 --> 30:00.532
Again, absolutely.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.537
So, what's the angle?

30:06.438 --> 30:09.976
The hell you lookin' at me for?
He's your father.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.084
It's okay.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.718
I'm not here
on official business.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.087
As a client?

30:21.187 --> 30:22.955
I always suspected
this day would come.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.790
Not as a client, either.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.860
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was
going to take you on myself.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.529
I'm actually here
just to say thank you.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.631
Come on in.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.533
Drink?

30:34.633 --> 30:36.135
No, thanks.

30:36.235 --> 30:40.239
So I guess my bringing Milan in
really helped your case, huh?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.341
Actually, it didn't, but
it's the thought that counts.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.476
Oh, well, I am

30:44.576 --> 30:47.279
very thoughtful.
People always say that about me.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.680
It's true.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.815
You didn't have
to bring her in, but you did.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.283
Well, you know me,

30:51.383 --> 30:52.818
Super Citizen.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.420
I promise
it had absolutely nothing to do

30:54.520 --> 30:57.189
with you threatening
to call Vice on me if I didn't.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.825
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Empty threat.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.193
Now he tells me.

31:01.293 --> 31:02.895
Brought you a little gift.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.364
Seriously?
Yeah.

31:05.464 --> 31:08.500
Just a token
of my appreciation.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.137
What is it?

31:11.237 --> 31:12.371
Take a look.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.178
That is a copy
of a wire transfer

31:19.278 --> 31:22.648
into your account
today for $20,000.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.717
Oh, that's
from an investment property.

31:25.817 --> 31:29.388
No. That's from Dr. Knight,
through his attorney Perlmutter

31:29.488 --> 31:32.124
by way of an overseas
shell corporation.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.161
No.
Yes.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.529
Milan received the same payment.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.335
I think you should go, Detective.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.805
And I think Dr. Knight is paying
you and Milan for your silence.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.207
You both know
who went in that room,

31:48.307 --> 31:50.109
and you both know
who cut him.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.511
And we all know
it wasn't some pimp.

31:52.611 --> 31:56.282
So why don't we knock off the
games and tell me who it was?

32:05.891 --> 32:07.426
I just snapped.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.929
That's the only way
I can describe it.

32:11.030 --> 32:15.101
I mean, he's my father,
and Milan-- she was my friend.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.768
Who does that?

32:16.868 --> 32:21.507
I think anyone in your position
would have snapped.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.511
How long have you been friends
with Milan?

32:25.611 --> 32:27.313
We go to NYU together.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.880
We're in the same circle.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.482
Did you know she was an escort?

32:30.582 --> 32:32.051
I'd heard rumors.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.719
And what about your father?
Look,

32:33.819 --> 32:37.956
he's a great dad,
he really is, but he has this--

32:38.057 --> 32:41.093
I don't know--
unquenchable ego?

32:41.193 --> 32:42.728
So you knew

32:42.828 --> 32:44.230
he wasn't faithful
to your mother?

32:44.330 --> 32:45.497
Unfaithful is one thing.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.865
Banging one of my friends

32:46.965 --> 32:49.101
on the regular is something
quite different.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.970
How did you hear
about your dad and Milan?

32:52.071 --> 32:53.605
Are you kidding?

32:53.705 --> 32:55.141
People were lining up,
dying to tell me

32:55.241 --> 32:58.510
how my awesome famous dad
is really anything but.

33:00.112 --> 33:03.182
Can you tell us what happened
at the hotel that night?

33:05.117 --> 33:06.352
I followed him.

33:06.452 --> 33:08.587
Watched them
have drinks.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.956
Watched them go
into his room.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.925
Waited outside
till she was gone.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.695
Then knocked on the door.

33:17.629 --> 33:18.930
And you cut your father?

33:19.031 --> 33:20.099
Like I said,

33:20.199 --> 33:21.167
I couldn't
really think straight.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.168
I was...

33:22.268 --> 33:23.935
yelling at him,

33:24.036 --> 33:26.638
probably not making
a lot of sense.

33:28.374 --> 33:29.608
And I don't know.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.744
I saw the knife
on the room service tray.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.912
<i>Hey, stop. Stop it.</i>

33:34.012 --> 33:35.081
I can explain everything.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.515
No. Do not say
another word.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.517
You sure? I'd love
to hear him explain.

33:38.617 --> 33:39.918
Positive.
You know,

33:40.018 --> 33:41.453
the tremendous irony
here is that what you did

33:41.553 --> 33:44.022
is wrong on so many levels,
yet it's not a felony.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.891
And, conversely,
what your daughter did

33:45.991 --> 33:47.559
was right on so many levels,

33:47.659 --> 33:50.296
but... it is a felony.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.863
And she's going to jail.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.832
Wh-What? Wait,
hold on a second.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.301
She did try to kill you.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.836
Now, granted, I would've
done the same thing myself

33:57.936 --> 33:59.738
if you'd cheated
on <i>my</i> mom.

33:59.838 --> 34:02.040
But it is felony assault.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.509
Probably looking at five years.

34:03.609 --> 34:04.510
You can't be serious.

34:04.610 --> 34:05.844
I'm dead serious.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.179
What the hell is wrong with you?

34:07.279 --> 34:09.115
With me?
Yeah, what kind
of person are you?

34:09.215 --> 34:10.482
That's rich,

34:10.582 --> 34:12.284
coming from the person
who cheats on his wife

34:12.384 --> 34:14.019
with his daughter's friend.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.255
Speaking of...

34:17.589 --> 34:19.258
Audrey!
No.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.592
Audrey!

34:20.692 --> 34:21.960
Do not say
another word!

34:22.060 --> 34:23.695
Not a word!

34:25.063 --> 34:28.667
Bet you'll sleep like a baby
tonight, huh, Doc?

34:30.136 --> 34:31.637
Yes, it's a different precinct.

34:31.737 --> 34:32.938
But the 2-0 is
the next one over.

34:33.038 --> 34:34.606
So it's like
I'm barely moving at all.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.842
Wait, you talked to McNichols?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.977
We have a better rapport.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.047
Good to know.
The point is,

34:42.148 --> 34:43.849
she's on board.
Just have to give her the word.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.651
What about the fact that it
seems like you really love

34:45.751 --> 34:47.186
this new job
with Intelligence?

34:47.286 --> 34:49.621
I do.
You're willing to
give it up for me?

34:49.721 --> 34:51.257
For us.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.825
I have to admit...

34:53.925 --> 34:56.295
it is a good compromise.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.829
Right?

34:57.929 --> 35:01.367
But... I've been thinking,
too, and, you know,

35:01.467 --> 35:03.135
your work stories...

35:03.902 --> 35:05.337
...they're not that interesting.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.206
Is that right?
Yeah.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.108
Truth is, you're not
really a great storyteller.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.510
I see.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.078
I'm serious.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.480
Then I guess
you don't want to know

35:14.580 --> 35:15.847
about the baby
I delivered last night.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.549
You delivered a
baby last night?

35:17.649 --> 35:19.151
Triplets. On the Triboro,

35:19.251 --> 35:20.452
actually.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.487
But you're not interested.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.522
You're right. I'm not.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.856
At all. Great.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.124
Because I'm not allowed
to talk about it.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.227
Top secret stuff, remember?
I do.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.295
And I'm fine with it.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.696
Eddie, you're
never gonna be fine

35:30.796 --> 35:32.598
with me not telling you
anything about work.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.166
No. Not only am
I fine with it,

35:34.266 --> 35:36.402
I'm really looking forward
to the new version of us.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.804
New version?
You know that thing
that happens to a couple

35:38.904 --> 35:40.539
when they have a
baby and they're--

35:40.639 --> 35:43.375
wake up years later, they're
so focused on being a parent

35:43.475 --> 35:45.411
that all they talk
about is the kids?

35:45.511 --> 35:47.045
Are you saying
you want to have a baby

35:47.145 --> 35:48.747
so that we have something else
to talk about?

35:48.847 --> 35:50.516
What? No.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.452
I'm saying work
is our baby.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.953
It's all we
ever talk about.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.555
And not being allowed
to talk about it

35:56.655 --> 35:58.089
might actually
be a blessing.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.659
And you're not gonna ask me
a million questions every day?

36:00.759 --> 36:03.128
Oh, no, no. I'm gonna ask you
a million questions every day.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.863
Just not about work.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.665
Then about what?

36:06.765 --> 36:08.200
I don't know.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.135
Maybe your feelings?

36:10.236 --> 36:13.038
Oh, you want me to tell you
how I'm feeling right now?

36:15.841 --> 36:19.778
Welcome to Jamie
and Eddie 2.0!

36:28.920 --> 36:30.289
Something's up.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.358
Erin is waiting for you.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.262
Oh.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.164
Temperature?

36:39.265 --> 36:40.866
Unreadable.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.784
Hey there.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.431
So you're not gonna
bite off my face?

37:14.433 --> 37:16.468
Not at all.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.608
And to what...

37:22.708 --> 37:25.043
do I owe the surprise?

37:28.614 --> 37:31.016
I wanted to thank you.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.251
For?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.655
Took me...

37:36.755 --> 37:39.591
a moment to sort this one out.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.092
I was upset.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.629
I don't mind telling you...

37:43.729 --> 37:45.897
my feelings were hurt.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.801
I'm sorry about that.

37:49.901 --> 37:53.038
But then I figured you out.

37:58.243 --> 38:01.146
I will be announcing
in a few weeks.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.382
I won't come straight out
of the gate with it, but...

38:03.482 --> 38:05.751
you should expect soon--
and publicly--

38:05.851 --> 38:07.786
that I will offer my...

38:07.886 --> 38:10.155
constructive criticism
of the NYPD

38:10.255 --> 38:13.959
and of you as commissioner
on a number of issues.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.228
But then you already knew that.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.801
Which is why
you're not endorsing me.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.938
So I am free to take you
and the department on.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.242
And why in the world
would I want that?

38:32.277 --> 38:35.381
Because I don't have
a snowball's chance in hell

38:35.481 --> 38:37.215
of winning if I don't.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.020
Oh.

38:42.120 --> 38:46.358
And you knew I wouldn't do it
unless you took the first shot.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.270
I think you're ready, kid.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.219
<i>Just another one</i>

39:14.319 --> 39:16.588
of dear old Dad's
teaching moments.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.923
Well,

39:18.023 --> 39:19.458
you got off easy,
if you ask me.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.227
Not endorsing me
is getting off easy?

39:22.327 --> 39:24.563
Because if you win,
which you will,

39:24.663 --> 39:25.664
then you get all the credit.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.165
Nobody else does.

39:27.265 --> 39:28.033
See?

39:28.133 --> 39:29.300
I'll drink to that.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.669
And, besides,
no teachable moment

39:30.769 --> 39:32.604
from Dad is worse
than when he sent me to school

39:32.704 --> 39:34.305
with maple syrup
in my hair.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.708
You can't possibly
be comparing the two.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.477
Of course I can.
Wait, wait, I'm sorry,

39:38.577 --> 39:40.278
maple syrup in your hair?

39:40.378 --> 39:42.313
Yes!
Danny was goofing around

39:42.414 --> 39:44.015
one morning at breakfast,
decided to use

39:44.115 --> 39:45.817
his pancake syrup as hair gel.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.085
Yes, as a joke.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.353
Dad told him
a hundred times

39:48.454 --> 39:49.755
"Knock it off."
Which, of course,

39:49.855 --> 39:51.022
Danny didn't
listen to him,

39:51.122 --> 39:53.091
so he sent him
to school like that.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.192
Yeah.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.494
With a nine-foot alfalfa spike

39:55.594 --> 39:57.663
on the back of my head.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.499
You never played
with your pancake syrup again.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.067
No, I didn't.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.135
And my friends never let me hear
the end of it again either.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.805
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.073
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
There you go.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.275
I'm sorry. It-It's bad,

40:10.375 --> 40:13.078
but it doesn't
even come close to comparing.
It's worse.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.245
Well, I got
both you guys beat.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.981
Let's hear it.
Yeah, bring it on.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.382
Fifth grade.

40:17.483 --> 40:19.184
Anthony Spoda sucker punches me
in the schoolyard.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.418
Oh.
Oh.

40:20.519 --> 40:21.920
I remember that.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.421
You came home looking
like a bruised fruit.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.756
Mm-hmm.
Exactly.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.625
So, I go to Dad,
show him my shiner

40:26.725 --> 40:28.026
and what does he do?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.227
You put ice on it?

40:29.327 --> 40:30.596
Uh, no.

40:30.696 --> 40:34.099
He sent him out of the house
to go face that kid.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.734
No!
Except I had to walk

40:35.834 --> 40:38.403
Jamie back to the kid's house to
make sure he didn't chicken out.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.472
What did you do?
He knocks

40:40.572 --> 40:41.907
on the lousy kid's door
and says,

40:42.007 --> 40:43.408
"You want to fight?

40:43.509 --> 40:45.877
"Okay, let's fight.
But this time,

40:45.977 --> 40:47.412
let's make it fair."

40:48.847 --> 40:51.182
I'm not sure my voice
was booming quite like that.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.417
It wasn't.
But...

40:52.518 --> 40:54.553
that was the gist.
What happened?

40:54.653 --> 40:57.589
Jamie sticks two jabs
and a right cross.

40:57.689 --> 40:58.790
Which he learned from me.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.258
Knocks him out immediately.

41:00.358 --> 41:01.760
Wait, how do you know
the story?

41:01.860 --> 41:04.095
I get to hear it every time
the big guy drags me out

41:04.195 --> 41:05.564
to the garage to
hit the heavy bag.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.032
And for the record,

41:07.132 --> 41:09.735
your dad learned
that move from me.

41:09.835 --> 41:12.671
Huh.
Yes, I did. A good
teachable moment. Thank you.

41:12.771 --> 41:15.841
And where, pray tell, did <i>you</i>
learn that move, Francis?

41:15.941 --> 41:18.376
I'm pretty sure I picked it
up in the Marines, Pop.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.812
Ho, ho, ho.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.115
You are so full of malarkey

41:24.215 --> 41:25.551
and you know it.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.085
"Malarkey."

41:35.260 --> 41:36.562
To victory.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.100
To victory!

41:42.200 --> 41:43.268
To victory. Victory.

41:43.368 --> 41:44.836
Hear, hear. Victory. Victory.
