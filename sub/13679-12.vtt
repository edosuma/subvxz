WEBVTT

00:02.239 --> 00:04.549
Previously on American Gothic...

00:04.590 --> 00:06.682
The man you pushed down the stairs

00:06.684 --> 00:08.434
was the Silver Bells Killer.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.853
We can dispose of the body.

00:10.855 --> 00:12.071
No one needs to know.

00:12.073 --> 00:13.606
He manipulated me.

00:13.608 --> 00:15.991
We are all victims of
your father's decisions.

00:15.993 --> 00:18.911
The Silver Bells accomplice
has struck again.

00:18.913 --> 00:21.163
It's the accomplice, taunting us.

00:21.165 --> 00:22.831
If you cooperate and you help us

00:22.833 --> 00:24.249
find this accomplice, I will do

00:24.251 --> 00:27.002
everything that I can
to keep you out of jail.

00:27.004 --> 00:28.754
I'd rather lose the race

00:28.756 --> 00:30.039
and keep my family

00:30.041 --> 00:31.707
than the other way around.

00:31.709 --> 00:35.461
You used our son to buy drugs.

00:35.463 --> 00:36.845
This gives me full custody of Jack.

00:36.847 --> 00:38.430
Please, no, Cam!

00:44.138 --> 00:46.105
Did anyone sleep?

00:46.107 --> 00:48.724
Not at all. Who could?

00:48.726 --> 00:50.893
Well, as long as we're all up,

00:50.895 --> 00:52.394
I might as well make breakfast.

00:52.396 --> 00:54.446
You've got to be kidding me.

00:55.983 --> 00:58.701
I can't believe there isn't one of me.

00:58.703 --> 01:01.320
Well, maybe next time, bud.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:18.589 --> 01:20.923
Oh, God.

01:23.928 --> 01:25.761
So it's true.

01:25.763 --> 01:28.597
Everything Mom told us.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.071
And all it took for you
guys to come clean

01:36.073 --> 01:39.024
was a psychopath targeting us.

01:40.111 --> 01:41.276
No one saw

01:41.278 --> 01:43.612
- anything, heard anything?
- No.

01:43.614 --> 01:45.581
We found it just like that.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.499
Which means that
someone was able to get in

01:47.501 --> 01:50.753
and out of the house
completely undetected.

01:50.755 --> 01:52.337
Yeah.

01:52.339 --> 01:55.340
So, Jack and I are leaving.

01:55.342 --> 01:57.626
And so should all of you.

01:57.628 --> 01:59.378
- Where are you going?
- You know,

01:59.380 --> 02:02.514
really anywhere that doesn't
have a bull's-eye on the door

02:02.516 --> 02:06.101
or a tiny version of me
dead and tied to a chair.

02:06.103 --> 02:08.270
Jack, let's go.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.443
I need to take you in. Now.

02:15.279 --> 02:16.216
Both of you.

02:16.388 --> 02:18.147
You have critical information
that's gonna help us

02:18.149 --> 02:20.565
- find the accomplice.
- I need to talk to Garrett first.

02:20.728 --> 02:23.619
- Tessa, we don't have time...
- Brady, please.

02:31.162 --> 02:32.995
You did it for me.

02:32.997 --> 02:35.714
That's how all this got started.

02:35.716 --> 02:37.800
You agreed to bury the body

02:37.802 --> 02:40.169
to protect me from knowing my part.

02:40.171 --> 02:43.972
You could have gone to the police.

02:43.974 --> 02:46.642
I would've been okay.

02:46.644 --> 02:49.978
Everything's out in the open now.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.765
- It's gonna play out how it play...
- â€­No.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.516
That's not good enough.

02:54.518 --> 02:56.018
You should run.

02:56.020 --> 02:58.854
What? â€­You need to go right now.

02:58.856 --> 03:02.858
Go get on a plane and leave the country.

03:02.860 --> 03:07.079
I'll wire you money and
you can start a new life.

03:07.081 --> 03:10.082
I'll find Christina,
and I'll convince her

03:10.084 --> 03:12.785
to let you be a part
of your child's life.

03:15.372 --> 03:18.207
But you guys are... you're in danger.

03:18.209 --> 03:19.675
I-I...

03:22.179 --> 03:24.213
- I can't just walk away.
- And I can't live

03:24.215 --> 03:28.267
with you losing
another minute of your life.

03:30.771 --> 03:33.188
Please.

03:33.190 --> 03:35.107
Run.

03:49.623 --> 03:51.874
Who called the police?

03:53.460 --> 03:55.544
I had a unit sent out
to watch the property.

03:55.546 --> 03:56.745
No one's gonna get in

03:56.747 --> 03:58.797
or out without police knowing.

03:58.799 --> 04:00.332
And I'm having a security company

04:00.334 --> 04:01.967
install a new system in here today.

04:01.969 --> 04:03.669
State-of-the-art, so...

04:07.675 --> 04:11.093
Okay, we got to go.

04:11.095 --> 04:12.678
Where's Garrett?

04:13.564 --> 04:15.731
Where's Garrett, Tess?

04:22.356 --> 04:25.107
I'm ready. Let's go.

04:31.332 --> 04:33.498
No more running.

04:48.048 --> 04:50.515
I need to get back on the case.

04:52.269 --> 04:54.052
I've given you two witnesses

04:54.054 --> 04:56.805
and the location of SBK's body.

04:56.807 --> 04:58.941
Even if you hadn't been suspended,

04:58.943 --> 05:02.027
it's still a massive
conflict of interest.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.900
I still have the tape.

05:11.705 --> 05:14.456
You and Conley talking about
the bribe that you took

05:14.458 --> 05:15.791
to destroy evidence.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.159
It might not be admissible,

05:17.161 --> 05:19.161
but it will be enough
to end your career.

05:19.163 --> 05:24.666
I try and be straight
with you, and you blackmail me?

05:24.668 --> 05:27.252
Cutter, my family's in danger.

05:27.254 --> 05:29.888
I can't be sidelined right now.

05:29.890 --> 05:33.091
Get me back on this case
or Internal Affairs

05:33.093 --> 05:35.060
will hear that tape.

05:36.847 --> 05:38.680
Do I need to remind you, Counselor,

05:38.682 --> 05:40.816
that we're in the middle
of a homicide investigation

05:40.818 --> 05:42.017
into the SBK accomplice?

05:42.019 --> 05:44.603
- My clients have...
- Your clients

05:44.605 --> 05:47.272
have willfully kept information...

05:47.274 --> 05:49.858
I'm sorry.

05:49.860 --> 05:52.494
I never told you that.

05:52.496 --> 05:54.863
But I am...

05:54.865 --> 05:56.698
truly sorry.

05:59.837 --> 06:02.004
For what, exactly?

06:04.174 --> 06:06.875
For convincing you to protect Tessa.

06:06.877 --> 06:09.044
Why don't you try again.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.350
- For letting you leave.
- â€­No.

06:17.471 --> 06:18.887
No.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.225
You want to apologize,

06:23.227 --> 06:26.979
you don't just say
what comes easy to you.

06:26.981 --> 06:29.648
You apologize for what you did.

06:32.403 --> 06:34.953
You apologize for all of it.

06:34.955 --> 06:38.623
Someday, if you have
a family of your own,

06:38.625 --> 06:41.243
maybe you'll understand.

06:41.245 --> 06:45.163
There's no limit to what
you would do to protect them.

06:45.165 --> 06:47.382
You know what?

06:48.919 --> 06:51.803
I am gonna have a family.

06:51.805 --> 06:53.672
Pretty soon, actually.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.058
And when I do...

06:56.060 --> 06:59.478
you won't know them.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.346
Ever.

07:01.348 --> 07:03.432
I'll make sure of that.

07:05.436 --> 07:08.353
I'll say you're dead.

07:12.359 --> 07:14.443
So, here's the deal.

07:14.445 --> 07:15.887
Five years for manslaughter,

07:16.064 --> 07:18.530
improper disposal of a body,
and obstruction of justice.

07:18.532 --> 07:20.832
One year for obstruction of justice

07:20.834 --> 07:23.118
and accessory after the fact.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.704
Those sentences will be suspended,

07:25.706 --> 07:29.624
no jail time, if you cooperate with

07:29.626 --> 07:31.510
the investigation into the accomplice.

07:34.548 --> 07:38.133
You seem unsure how to
respond, so let me help.

07:38.135 --> 07:40.685
It was an outstanding bit
of legal maneuvering.

07:40.687 --> 07:42.604
I am very good at what I do.

07:42.606 --> 07:44.856
Thanks.

08:12.503 --> 08:13.802
Hi.

08:13.804 --> 08:16.421
How are you?

08:16.423 --> 08:19.174
Fine, yeah. All is well.

08:19.176 --> 08:23.061
Um, I'm actually back in
Boston for a wedding.

08:23.063 --> 08:27.065
I keep seeing your campaign
ads everywhere.

08:27.067 --> 08:30.485
I just wanted to wish you
good luck on Tuesday.

08:30.487 --> 08:32.770
Thank you.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.990
It's nice to hear from you.

08:37.443 --> 08:41.580
It's been really rough going
here without you, to be honest.

08:41.582 --> 08:44.032
Sorry to bother you.

08:44.034 --> 08:46.118
Hey, um, I'm sorry, Naomi.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.953
Can-can I call you back?

08:47.955 --> 08:50.255
No, of course. No rush.

08:50.257 --> 08:51.623
Thanks.

08:57.464 --> 08:59.548
What can I do for you?

08:59.550 --> 09:03.435
One of my guys found
something while they were running cable.

09:05.105 --> 09:07.439
This happens more than you think.

09:07.441 --> 09:09.641
We start opening up walls,
going through vents,

09:09.643 --> 09:11.393
we find stuff.

09:11.395 --> 09:14.779
People get excited, think
it's gonna be, uh, gold bars

09:14.781 --> 09:16.114
or a lost Picasso or something,

09:16.116 --> 09:18.817
but, uh, usually it's just

09:18.819 --> 09:21.153
sex toys or pot.

09:21.155 --> 09:23.872
Which, you know, is pretty fun, too.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.221
I'll take care of this.

09:39.223 --> 09:40.922
Great.

09:42.726 --> 09:44.643
Okay, we're all clear, guys.

09:58.575 --> 10:00.859
It's a weird box of bells.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.577
We don't know what it means.

10:02.579 --> 10:04.112
If you're looking for the bells,

10:04.114 --> 10:05.330
they're gone.

10:05.332 --> 10:06.615
I had Gunther

10:06.617 --> 10:07.949
get rid of...

10:07.951 --> 10:10.001
all that old stuff from the shed.

10:10.003 --> 10:12.370
Just like the bells
from the other murders.

10:41.046 --> 10:42.880
Who is it?

10:42.882 --> 10:45.716
It's Officer Petrilla from Boston PD.

10:54.393 --> 10:56.560
Thank you.

10:57.863 --> 10:59.279
We're here to process

10:59.281 --> 11:01.782
the dollhouse for prints and DNA.

11:01.784 --> 11:03.567
Hello again.

11:03.569 --> 11:05.486
I swabbed you.

11:05.488 --> 11:06.820
A while back.

11:06.822 --> 11:08.655
Is there anything else

11:08.657 --> 11:10.541
in the house that we should know about?

11:11.377 --> 11:12.993
Excuse me?

11:12.995 --> 11:16.079
Any other potential evidence
that we should look at?

11:16.081 --> 11:17.631
No.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.249
That's it.

11:19.251 --> 11:21.418
Don't hold anything back.

11:21.420 --> 11:23.887
Any detail you can remember about SBK.

11:23.889 --> 11:25.472
No matter how small.

11:25.474 --> 11:27.591
A mole, a chipped tooth.

11:27.593 --> 11:28.926
Now, I'm gonna ask you some questions.

11:28.928 --> 11:30.310
I want you to use the reference photos

11:30.312 --> 11:31.645
to help you with your description.

11:31.647 --> 11:34.264
Let's get started.

11:40.239 --> 11:41.772
Did he remind you of any celebrity?

11:41.774 --> 11:45.609
Uh, no, I don't
really know any celebrities.

11:45.611 --> 11:48.579
Maybe a little like... Ted Danson.

11:48.581 --> 11:51.031
I think his eyes were brown.

11:51.033 --> 11:53.250
Like that, they were, uh, small

11:53.252 --> 11:54.368
and quite wide set.

11:54.370 --> 11:55.536
Dark hair.

11:55.538 --> 11:57.754
I think brown.

11:57.756 --> 11:58.755
Maybe black.

11:58.757 --> 11:59.873
More like

11:59.875 --> 12:01.425
picture number four.

12:01.427 --> 12:03.293
Yeah, like that, but, uh...

12:03.295 --> 12:04.962
a thinner nose.

12:04.964 --> 12:07.130
And a little bit of facial hair.

12:08.601 --> 12:11.685
No, more like a five o'clock shadow.

12:12.521 --> 12:13.937
Okay.

12:18.027 --> 12:19.026
Is that close?

12:19.028 --> 12:21.144
Yeah, that looks like him.

12:21.146 --> 12:22.479
That seems about right.

12:22.481 --> 12:26.650
It's almost like
it's two different people.

12:26.652 --> 12:28.285
It was a long time ago.

12:28.287 --> 12:30.954
I only saw him for a few seconds.

12:30.956 --> 12:33.290
Anything else?

12:33.292 --> 12:36.076
Uh, scars, tattoos?

12:36.078 --> 12:38.662
Unusual clothing?

12:41.667 --> 12:44.635
He had a tattoo on his chest.

12:44.637 --> 12:46.587
It-it, uh... it had a cross on it.

12:46.589 --> 12:49.256
Uh, like a-a crucifix?

12:49.258 --> 12:50.474
It was different.

12:50.476 --> 12:51.808
Uh...

12:53.145 --> 12:56.229
Okay. Draw it the best you can.

13:08.243 --> 13:09.576
Like that.

13:09.578 --> 13:12.446
It's a Brigid's cross.

13:12.448 --> 13:15.115
It's an old Irish symbol.

13:15.117 --> 13:17.117
Every other drunk D-bag
we bring in here

13:17.119 --> 13:19.002
has got one tattooed on his calf.

13:19.004 --> 13:23.090
So, you've narrowed it down
to an Irish guy in Boston

13:23.092 --> 13:24.708
who possibly looks like this.

13:24.710 --> 13:27.210
Or this.

13:30.432 --> 13:33.934
All right, bud.

13:33.936 --> 13:36.637
Yeah, I'm going to, uh,

13:36.639 --> 13:40.057
make you something to eat in a bit.

13:40.059 --> 13:41.308
Okay.

13:41.310 --> 13:43.226
I'm gonna watch my jellyfish video.

13:43.228 --> 13:45.312
All right.

13:46.899 --> 13:49.232
The cell regeneration process,

13:49.234 --> 13:51.568
called transdifferentiation,

13:51.570 --> 13:54.738
is unique to the animal kingdom.

13:54.740 --> 13:58.075
In theory, it can
repeat itself indefinitely,

13:58.077 --> 13:59.710
if the immortal jellyfish

13:59.712 --> 14:01.962
doesn't fall victim
to natural predators.

14:01.964 --> 14:04.715
As a result of their regenerative
properties,

14:04.717 --> 14:08.468
this species of jellyfish
is perpetually multiplying.

14:20.983 --> 14:23.433
The jellyfish is indigenous
to the Pacific region

14:23.435 --> 14:26.236
but has spread
throughout the colder areas

14:26.238 --> 14:28.271
of the Northern Pacific Ocean.

14:28.273 --> 14:31.441
The distinctions among species...

14:31.443 --> 14:33.410
Hey, bud.

14:33.412 --> 14:35.028
Hey, Mom.

14:35.030 --> 14:36.830
You want to go for a ride?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.999
Yeah.

14:44.089 --> 14:45.372
Where are we going?

14:45.374 --> 14:46.590
It's a surprise.

14:46.592 --> 14:48.175
Should we wait for Dad?

14:48.177 --> 14:51.094
Nah, he can join us after.

14:56.351 --> 14:57.768
Sophie!

14:59.221 --> 15:00.721
Sophie!

15:06.979 --> 15:09.229
No.

15:16.054 --> 15:18.655
No...

15:31.136 --> 15:32.636
Oh!

15:40.846 --> 15:44.064
The police released you?

15:44.066 --> 15:46.316
I told them everything I know.

15:46.318 --> 15:48.485
Did you?

15:52.941 --> 15:55.108
You told us those were gone.

15:55.110 --> 15:58.245
You held onto them

15:58.247 --> 16:00.113
in case someone else got in your way.

16:00.115 --> 16:02.365
- Another David Morales?
- Alison...

16:02.367 --> 16:04.668
And someone did, didn't they?

16:04.670 --> 16:07.587
Jennifer Windham.

16:07.589 --> 16:12.292
And you still knew how to stage
a Silver Bells murder.

16:12.294 --> 16:14.928
You killed her, didn't you?

16:22.020 --> 16:26.022
You snuck into her home...

16:26.024 --> 16:28.725
put a belt around her neck.

16:28.727 --> 16:30.644
- Alison...
- You strangled her.

16:30.646 --> 16:32.229
Say it. Say the words.

16:32.231 --> 16:33.814
"I killed her."

16:34.900 --> 16:36.566
Say it!

16:36.568 --> 16:39.286
I had to.

16:39.288 --> 16:41.454
For Garrett.

16:41.456 --> 16:42.906
He was in prison,

16:42.908 --> 16:45.408
falsely accused of being the accomplice.

16:45.410 --> 16:48.829
I proved that it couldn't be him.

16:51.583 --> 16:55.085
You could justify anything.

17:01.310 --> 17:03.093
I've been...

17:03.095 --> 17:04.895
thinking about everything
that's happened

17:04.896 --> 17:07.681
since we found these bells in the shed.

17:07.683 --> 17:08.848
Like Gunther.

17:08.851 --> 17:12.569
Why did he decide to hang himself

17:12.570 --> 17:14.320
at the exact moment

17:14.323 --> 17:16.606
the police were closing in on Cam?

17:16.608 --> 17:19.276
Gunther was dying of cancer.

17:19.278 --> 17:21.444
He wanted his wife to
be financially secure

17:21.445 --> 17:23.246
after his death.

17:23.248 --> 17:24.664
And now she is.

17:24.665 --> 17:26.950
Oh, my God.

17:34.426 --> 17:38.178
You were the only one
with Dad when he died.

17:38.180 --> 17:41.181
What really happened?

17:42.184 --> 17:46.136
He wanted to tell
the police about Morales.

17:52.811 --> 17:56.479
Everyone's so afraid of the accomplice.

17:56.481 --> 18:00.066
And we have a serial killer
right in front of us.

18:02.955 --> 18:06.156
I didn't kill that blind woman.

18:06.158 --> 18:09.876
And I didn't put bells in my own purse.

18:09.878 --> 18:13.213
There is someone after us.

18:13.215 --> 18:15.498
I'm scared.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.967
And you should be, too.

18:16.969 --> 18:19.169
Oh, I am.

18:25.260 --> 18:27.310
You belong in prison.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.597
I don't think you fully grasp

18:30.599 --> 18:32.933
everything that I've
done for this family.

18:34.569 --> 18:36.353
I helped us survive.

18:36.355 --> 18:40.073
And I did it so you could
have everything.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.242
And look at you now.

18:42.244 --> 18:45.528
You're this close to making
political history.

18:45.530 --> 18:48.581
Tessa has finally embraced motherhood.

18:48.583 --> 18:53.336
Cam is finally rid of Sophie,
and Garrett is out of prison.

18:53.338 --> 18:56.089
I had a hand in all of it.

18:56.091 --> 19:01.378
And there's not one thing
I would take back.

19:01.380 --> 19:04.464
And if anything happens in the future,

19:04.466 --> 19:06.349
I'm here for you.

19:09.888 --> 19:14.858
Let... me... go.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.529
Hey, where are you?

19:41.531 --> 19:43.898
I need to talk to you.

19:47.404 --> 19:49.620
I'm on my way.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.490
The deal is done.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.243
You're not gonna do jail time
for what happened back then.

19:55.245 --> 19:57.962
Right, but what if someone
were to accuse me

19:57.964 --> 20:02.300
of having been involved
with something really serious

20:02.302 --> 20:05.002
in the present day?

20:05.004 --> 20:07.004
And they had evidence.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.339
What steps would I...

20:08.341 --> 20:09.757
Let me stop you right there.

20:09.759 --> 20:11.759
Have you watched any good TV lately?

20:11.761 --> 20:14.345
- Pardon? - I only ask
because it can be very soothing,

20:14.347 --> 20:16.013
get your mind off things.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.149
I'll tell you what show
I love... Boston Legal.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.183
Have you seen it?

20:19.185 --> 20:21.686
Oh, terrific show.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.354
Great blend of comedy and drama.

20:23.819 --> 20:26.820
And that Denny Crane, what a character.

20:26.822 --> 20:29.873
Alan Shore, the other
impeccable legal mind,

20:29.875 --> 20:31.658
he was always toeing the ethical line.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.994
Like he might say to a client, uh,

20:33.996 --> 20:35.579
"As your attorney,

20:35.581 --> 20:37.581
I would never advise
that you break any laws,

20:37.583 --> 20:40.417
but if you needed your assets protected,

20:40.419 --> 20:43.170
you should consider liquidating
as soon as possible.

20:43.172 --> 20:45.255
With solid evidence,

20:45.257 --> 20:48.091
it's very likely assets
could be frozen immediately.

20:48.093 --> 20:50.143
And keep your passport handy,

20:50.145 --> 20:52.312
in case you decide to travel abroad."

20:52.314 --> 20:53.680
That kind of thing.

20:53.682 --> 20:55.849
Of course, he'd never say it outright.

20:55.851 --> 20:58.018
But the client would catch on.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.353
Quite clever.

20:59.355 --> 21:01.188
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:01.190 --> 21:02.856
Sometimes I go on these little
verbal loopty-loos.

21:02.858 --> 21:05.242
As far as your dilemma,

21:05.244 --> 21:09.079
I... I'm afraid I
can't advise you on that.

21:18.591 --> 21:22.292
I mean, she could be heading to
Canada with him, for all I know.

21:22.294 --> 21:23.543
Okay, Cam, don't panic.

21:23.545 --> 21:24.962
â€­Um...

21:24.964 --> 21:26.597
What about her credit cards?

21:26.599 --> 21:28.515
Uh, is there a statement anywhere?

21:28.517 --> 21:32.219
- Maybe she made a recent purchase.
- Yes. Yes.

21:39.228 --> 21:40.944
Yes. â€­Thanks.

21:45.401 --> 21:47.484
Hi. This is Sophie Hawthorne.

21:47.486 --> 21:50.904
Um, I just had my card,
but I looked in my wallet,

21:50.906 --> 21:52.739
and it's-it's not there.

21:52.741 --> 21:55.158
And I'm worried that it's fallen
into the wrong hands.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.210
I'm wondering, can you confirm

21:57.212 --> 21:59.963
my most recent purchases?

21:59.965 --> 22:02.332
Oh, yeah, I'm happy to
give you the last four digits

22:02.334 --> 22:03.750
of my Social.

22:03.752 --> 22:05.502
They are three,

22:05.504 --> 22:09.423
two, five, six.

22:09.425 --> 22:11.174
That's 3256.

22:11.176 --> 22:13.143
That's right. Yes, thank you.

22:17.349 --> 22:19.683
Yes, yeah, that sounds right.

22:19.685 --> 22:21.485
Yeah, of course.

22:21.487 --> 22:23.437
The convenience store.

22:23.439 --> 22:25.689
Downtown. Yeah, thanks.

22:25.691 --> 22:27.107
Bye.

22:27.109 --> 22:28.442
Wait, where are you going?

22:28.444 --> 22:29.660
Uh, we're going to find Jack.

22:29.662 --> 22:31.361
No, I really need to talk to you both.

22:31.363 --> 22:32.529
As soon as we get back.

23:06.482 --> 23:08.281
Hey.

23:08.283 --> 23:09.866
It's me.

23:11.704 --> 23:13.620
How soon can we meet up?

24:20.055 --> 24:21.221
He's nine years old.

24:21.223 --> 24:23.190
He's got an octopus on his shirt.

24:23.192 --> 24:25.108
She's got a tattoo on her neck.

24:25.110 --> 24:27.477
It's a cherry blossom.

24:27.479 --> 24:29.646
Oh, yeah, I remember her.

24:29.648 --> 24:30.897
Foxy.

24:30.899 --> 24:32.899
Did she say where they were going?

24:32.901 --> 24:35.452
No. They were in and out pretty quick.

24:35.454 --> 24:37.704
What did she buy? Do you remember?

24:37.706 --> 24:38.905
Yeah, I do.

24:38.907 --> 24:41.575
Two bottles of ranch dressing.

24:41.577 --> 24:44.244
Two bottles of ranch dressing?

24:44.246 --> 24:46.046
That's it?

24:46.048 --> 24:47.914
Hey, I don't judge.

24:47.916 --> 24:51.585
My uncle used to drink
that stuff like milkshakes.

24:51.587 --> 24:53.670
Of course, he's dead now.

24:56.425 --> 24:58.308
Okay, I mean...

24:58.310 --> 25:00.644
I mean, obviously she's on
something. She's being erratic.

25:00.646 --> 25:02.512
- She's got my kid.
- Calm down. Look.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.567
All right.

25:13.442 --> 25:15.442
Is this public knowledge yet?

25:15.444 --> 25:16.993
Is what public knowledge?

25:16.995 --> 25:18.612
Everything I told you.

25:18.614 --> 25:19.913
Is it in the press?

25:19.915 --> 25:21.281
No. Until we catch the accomplice,

25:21.283 --> 25:22.582
we're not releasing any details.

25:22.584 --> 25:24.117
All right, then I need a favor.

25:24.119 --> 25:26.086
I need your help to find Christina.

25:26.088 --> 25:27.921
You serious?

25:27.923 --> 25:28.922
Just an address.

25:28.924 --> 25:30.957
"Just an address."

25:30.959 --> 25:33.376
Sure, Garrett, why not?
Uh, you need anything else?

25:33.378 --> 25:36.179
Maybe, uh, Hillary's e-mails
or Trump's tax returns?

25:38.934 --> 25:40.600
Brady.

25:43.972 --> 25:46.973
Look, I just want her to hear
the truth from me first.

25:46.975 --> 25:48.358
That's all.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.110
Dana has an update

25:50.112 --> 25:52.112
on SBK's bones. I'm going to the lab.

25:52.114 --> 25:53.522
Great. Right behind you.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.150
- Excuse me.
- All right, look,

25:57.152 --> 25:58.451
how 'bout I write her a letter,

25:58.453 --> 26:01.071
and you can decide
if she gets it or not.

26:01.073 --> 26:02.572
I have to go do this.

26:02.574 --> 26:04.491
Don't go anywhere.

26:16.672 --> 26:18.838
I've decided on the kind of boat I want.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.340
Ketch sailboat.

26:20.342 --> 26:22.676
I've been pricing a few on eBay.

26:22.678 --> 26:24.427
What is she talking about?

26:24.429 --> 26:27.898
Let's discuss bones first
and boats later, Dana.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.516
No DNA match to the system,

26:29.518 --> 26:33.069
but SBK suffered a fracture
to the left femur.

26:33.071 --> 26:35.355
It was repaired with a titanium rod.

26:35.357 --> 26:37.941
13 Boston hospitals

26:37.943 --> 26:41.661
purchased this make of
rod between '89 and '98.

26:42.664 --> 26:44.253
Okay.

26:44.408 --> 26:46.917
So we get the medical records
of every one of those hospitals

26:46.919 --> 26:48.952
who had the surgery,
we compile a master list.

26:48.954 --> 26:51.454
That is a nine-year window.

26:51.456 --> 26:54.758
Even if we narrow it down,
we-we don't know SBK's name.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.092
Wh-What good are medical records?

26:56.094 --> 26:57.928
Then we cross-reference the names

26:57.930 --> 27:00.547
with DMV photo records and
we show them to Garrett.

27:00.549 --> 27:03.466
It's gonna be easier for him to
I.D. a face than describe one.

27:03.468 --> 27:05.268
One more thing.

27:05.270 --> 27:07.771
Prints in the dollhouse didn't
match anyone in the system,

27:07.773 --> 27:11.558
but they did have
elevated levels of amino acids.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.109
Meaning?

27:13.111 --> 27:16.279
The accomplice is female.

27:25.290 --> 27:27.824
Thanks for coming over.

27:27.826 --> 27:29.709
Of course.

27:29.711 --> 27:31.127
Everything okay?

27:31.129 --> 27:35.632
There's a lot
swirling around at the moment.

27:35.634 --> 27:38.385
Best kind of preparation for mayor.

27:40.172 --> 27:42.472
I need your advice.

27:42.474 --> 27:44.257
And you've always been really good

27:44.259 --> 27:48.561
at helping me work through... problems.

27:50.232 --> 27:53.600
Let's say someone I knew,

27:53.602 --> 27:55.935
someone close to me,

27:55.937 --> 27:59.322
had done something truly horrible,

27:59.324 --> 28:02.692
and the right thing to do would
be to tell the authorities,

28:02.694 --> 28:07.447
but doing so would destroy
a lot of lives.

28:07.449 --> 28:10.417
This is about the Silver Bells case.

28:10.419 --> 28:13.336
Naomi, I can't.

28:14.373 --> 28:16.506
I'm asking you

28:16.508 --> 28:21.177
what you think I
should do in that scenario.

28:21.179 --> 28:23.763
How would it affect your campaign

28:23.765 --> 28:25.548
if you came forward?

28:25.550 --> 28:27.133
It would end it.

28:27.135 --> 28:28.802
Unequivocally.

28:28.804 --> 28:31.688
Is there any physical evidence

28:31.690 --> 28:34.357
tying you to this hypothetical crime?

28:34.359 --> 28:36.359
Or the cover-up?

28:38.980 --> 28:41.448
Why did you want to run for mayor?

28:44.036 --> 28:46.986
It's... hard to remember now.

28:46.988 --> 28:48.988
Then let me remind you.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.207
You've been given every opportunity,

28:51.209 --> 28:53.326
every advantage in life,

28:53.328 --> 28:56.212
and you want that privilege
to mean something.

28:56.214 --> 28:59.999
To be for something.

29:00.001 --> 29:03.303
You want your girls
growing up thinking it's normal

29:03.305 --> 29:05.472
to see women in power.

29:05.474 --> 29:08.508
You want better public education,

29:08.510 --> 29:11.144
better health care, safer streets,

29:11.146 --> 29:15.648
more opportunities, but anyone
can be blindly idealistic.

29:15.650 --> 29:19.352
Not everyone can be calculating,

29:19.354 --> 29:23.523
even ruthless, in service
of those ideals.

29:25.410 --> 29:27.610
But you can.

29:30.866 --> 29:34.117
Is all of that still true?

29:37.205 --> 29:39.422
Yes.

29:43.261 --> 29:46.880
Then you know the move.

30:56.186 --> 30:58.103
I got rid of the bells.

30:59.890 --> 31:01.723
No one will ever know.

31:04.361 --> 31:06.111
Thank you.

31:06.113 --> 31:07.729
I didn't do it for you.

31:07.731 --> 31:09.197
I know.

31:09.199 --> 31:12.951
You made a difficult decision
for the greater good.

31:12.953 --> 31:14.569
Just like I did.

31:14.571 --> 31:17.239
We are not the same.

31:17.241 --> 31:23.211
I don't want you near me
or my children ever again.

31:24.631 --> 31:27.582
As far as I'm concerned,

31:27.584 --> 31:29.885
you no longer exist.

31:58.248 --> 32:00.832
Look.

32:02.169 --> 32:03.919
Did you know that octopuses

32:03.921 --> 32:06.788
are the most
intelligent invertebrates on Earth?

32:06.790 --> 32:08.206
Wow.

32:08.208 --> 32:10.125
And they're escape artists, too.

32:10.127 --> 32:12.127
There was an octopus in New Zealand

32:12.129 --> 32:13.795
that escaped its tank,

32:13.797 --> 32:16.181
crawled all the way across the floor

32:16.183 --> 32:20.385
into a drainpipe,
and went into the ocean.

32:22.890 --> 32:24.689
Now it's free.

32:24.691 --> 32:27.609
You know the bear
Uncle Garrett gave you?

32:27.611 --> 32:29.978
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.781
I recorded a message for you on it.

32:32.783 --> 32:34.449
- Okay.
- And I want you to know...

32:34.451 --> 32:36.401
Jack! Hey!

32:36.403 --> 32:37.819
Hey. â€­Hey, bud.

32:37.821 --> 32:39.905
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure.

32:39.907 --> 32:41.339
Hey, dude.

32:41.456 --> 32:42.667
Do you want to show
me the jellyfish tank?

32:42.670 --> 32:44.960
Yeah, but they don't
have immortal jellyfish here.

32:44.962 --> 32:46.378
I get it though,

32:46.380 --> 32:47.963
because they can't thrive in captivity.

32:47.965 --> 32:49.080
Right.

32:49.082 --> 32:50.498
Mom, you're coming, too, right?

32:50.500 --> 32:53.301
I'll be right there, Jack.

32:53.303 --> 32:54.836
Okay, cool.

32:54.838 --> 32:56.838
You know, I was thinking,

32:56.840 --> 32:58.974
if scientists could find out what makes

32:58.976 --> 33:03.178
Turritopsis dohrnii immortal
and apply it to humans,

33:03.180 --> 33:05.096
maybe we could live longer.

33:06.850 --> 33:10.185
The custody lawyer your mom hired...

33:14.408 --> 33:18.526
I won't even get supervised visitation.

33:23.667 --> 33:26.751
I just wanted one last memory with him.

33:29.172 --> 33:32.507
Well...

33:32.509 --> 33:35.794
you got what you wanted.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.597
I hope you enjoyed it.

33:46.974 --> 33:49.891
You're a lost cause.

33:52.729 --> 33:54.562
Cam?

33:58.735 --> 34:01.786
Please don't let him forget me.

34:21.891 --> 34:23.975
Arthur McLaughlin.

34:23.976 --> 34:26.511
Boston area, middle-aged white male,

34:26.513 --> 34:28.429
had a rod put in his leg in...

34:28.431 --> 34:29.898
'93.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.068
Survey says...

34:35.522 --> 34:36.987
Hey.

34:36.989 --> 34:39.107
Hemingway?

34:41.411 --> 34:42.827
Not him.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.531
How many more of these are there?

34:46.533 --> 34:49.250
1,194.

34:50.253 --> 34:52.837
Next.

34:52.839 --> 34:54.672
Franklin Harkington.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.876
You all right?

34:57.878 --> 35:01.379
Thank you for sticking around.

35:01.381 --> 35:04.182
Ben's okay with you
taking extra time off?

35:04.184 --> 35:05.500
Yeah. It's fine.

35:05.502 --> 35:07.852
Um...

35:07.854 --> 35:10.939
I want to see this through with you.

35:10.941 --> 35:12.640
We were always a good team.

35:16.613 --> 35:18.947
How are things with Tom?

35:22.152 --> 35:25.453
I thought pushing you away
would help fix things.

35:28.291 --> 35:30.125
It didn't.

35:34.798 --> 35:36.831
We should get back to work.

35:36.833 --> 35:39.300
Writing your victory speech.

35:39.302 --> 35:42.003
Mm. The polls say it should
be a concession.

35:42.005 --> 35:43.671
Ah. The polls also said that

35:43.673 --> 35:45.473
Brexit wasn't gonna happen, so...

35:47.511 --> 35:50.311
Sorry.

35:50.313 --> 35:52.847
I need to grab this.

36:15.622 --> 36:18.423
Franklin Zyckner.

36:18.425 --> 36:20.842
Z-Y-C-K-N-E-R.

36:24.181 --> 36:26.514
Shakespeare?

36:27.384 --> 36:29.100
No.

36:52.492 --> 36:54.542
The tattoo.

36:54.544 --> 36:56.077
Brigid's cross.

36:56.079 --> 36:57.796
What if it's not just

36:57.798 --> 36:58.913
an old Irish symbol?

36:58.915 --> 37:00.081
What do you mean?

37:00.083 --> 37:01.549
What if it's someone's name?

37:01.551 --> 37:05.336
Like his wife or his daughter
or his mother?

37:05.338 --> 37:06.638
What, named Brigid?

37:06.640 --> 37:08.089
Well, if we cross-reference that name

37:08.091 --> 37:12.093
with a list of patients, we can see...

37:12.095 --> 37:13.728
One hit.

37:15.565 --> 37:16.931
Brigid Martin.

37:16.933 --> 37:19.767
Emergency contact for
her husband John Martin.

37:19.769 --> 37:22.737
He had femur surgery in '97.

37:37.954 --> 37:39.671
Garrett?

37:39.673 --> 37:41.372
That's him.

37:43.126 --> 37:45.343
That's the Silver Bells Killer.

38:04.497 --> 38:06.080
He conked out fast.

38:06.082 --> 38:07.965
Yeah.

38:07.967 --> 38:09.884
Long day.

38:09.886 --> 38:13.337
Yeah.

38:13.339 --> 38:14.889
I couldn't have done it without you.

38:14.891 --> 38:16.557
That's not true.

38:16.559 --> 38:18.008
No, it's absolutely true.

38:18.010 --> 38:20.811
I mean, I was a total mess.
You calmed me down.

38:21.681 --> 38:24.899
You figured out where they were.

38:26.269 --> 38:28.602
Well, I'm glad I could help.

38:30.656 --> 38:34.525
Ever since I found out what
Garrett did to protect me,

38:34.527 --> 38:37.528
I just... eh...

38:37.530 --> 38:41.782
It's dawned on me how
the rest of you see me.

38:41.784 --> 38:43.167
What do you mean?

38:43.169 --> 38:45.119
Fragile, sensitive Tessa,

38:45.121 --> 38:48.255
who always needs protecting.

38:51.878 --> 38:54.879
Well, I don't see you that way.

38:54.881 --> 38:56.463
Who was the first person there

38:56.465 --> 38:58.682
when I was going through withdrawal?

39:00.603 --> 39:02.636
Who kept in touch with Garrett?

39:04.190 --> 39:05.890
And when the family drifts apart,

39:05.892 --> 39:10.611
you always pull it back together.

39:15.651 --> 39:17.484
You're the glue.

39:20.656 --> 39:23.874
Well, he's squeaky clean
for a serial killer.

39:23.876 --> 39:25.743
No criminal record whatsoever.

39:25.745 --> 39:29.964
His wife Brigid died in
1997, in the same car accident

39:29.966 --> 39:32.299
that left John
needing surgery on his leg.

39:32.301 --> 39:34.001
What about relatives, associates?

39:34.003 --> 39:37.471
Nah, no-no siblings,
both parents are long dead.

39:37.473 --> 39:39.506
They had a daughter.

39:39.508 --> 39:41.558
Named Dara.

39:41.560 --> 39:42.893
We need to find her.

39:42.895 --> 39:45.646
Thanks, guys. See you tomorrow.

39:45.648 --> 39:47.064
Everyone's heading out.

39:47.066 --> 39:49.016
But energy's good, morale is high.

39:49.018 --> 39:50.601
We are almost there.

39:50.603 --> 39:52.519
You want to grab dinner?

39:52.521 --> 39:55.572
Guess who I just got off the phone with.

39:55.574 --> 39:58.158
Hawaii's future governor.

39:58.160 --> 40:01.078
Your boss, Ben.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.580
He says you backed out of the job

40:03.582 --> 40:06.116
the night before
your flight to Honolulu.

40:07.837 --> 40:10.704
You're not in Boston for a wedding.

40:10.706 --> 40:12.456
You never left.

40:12.458 --> 40:13.540
How did you...

40:13.542 --> 40:15.626
The metro cards in your purse.

40:16.512 --> 40:19.596
You've been here all along.

40:19.598 --> 40:21.799
So why did you lie to me?

40:22.635 --> 40:25.302
You broke my heart.

40:25.304 --> 40:27.688
I was in no place to run

40:27.690 --> 40:30.140
someone else's campaign.

40:30.142 --> 40:33.527
And I don't believe in Ben
the way that I believe in you.

40:33.529 --> 40:34.778
But I shouldn't have lied.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.447
No.

40:36.449 --> 40:39.033
I have had enough of that in my life.

40:39.035 --> 40:39.984
Too much.

40:39.986 --> 40:41.618
- Alison...
- Please,

40:41.620 --> 40:43.454
leave.

41:01.140 --> 41:03.757
Dara Martin was born in Somerville,

41:03.759 --> 41:06.310
April 5, 1986.

41:06.312 --> 41:08.479
The only child of John and Brigid.

41:08.481 --> 41:10.264
She lived a pretty normal life

41:10.266 --> 41:13.517
until she lost her mother
in a car accident, then...

41:13.519 --> 41:16.153
Obviously, her father
disappeared a few years later.

41:16.155 --> 41:17.571
Where is she now?

41:17.573 --> 41:19.907
No record of her after 2003.

41:19.909 --> 41:23.660
She just vanished.

41:25.281 --> 41:28.115
Is there a death certificate?

41:28.117 --> 41:29.666
No.

41:32.038 --> 41:35.706
Maybe she changed her identity

41:35.708 --> 41:38.092
and became someone else.

41:47.470 --> 41:51.772
Dara's last known address,
from early 2003.

41:54.226 --> 41:55.726
Look familiar?

41:55.728 --> 41:57.561
That's Ramona Canby's address.

41:57.563 --> 41:59.029
Ramona knew Dara

41:59.031 --> 42:00.481
and her father?

42:00.483 --> 42:03.200
So she must have taken Dara in

42:03.202 --> 42:05.235
just after her father disappeared.

42:05.237 --> 42:08.539
And Dara killed her
when we got too close.

42:08.541 --> 42:12.076
Because Dara Martin is the accomplice.

42:12.078 --> 42:14.078
Which means SBK murdered
all these people

42:14.080 --> 42:16.380
with his own daughter.

42:16.382 --> 42:18.465
She's someone smart.

42:18.467 --> 42:21.051
Savvy enough to create
a whole new identity.

42:21.053 --> 42:22.169
We know she was

42:22.171 --> 42:23.220
at Mitchell's funeral.

42:23.222 --> 42:25.255
Mmm. And we know that

42:25.257 --> 42:29.393
she got into Madeline's purse,
into the house on her own.

42:30.513 --> 42:33.180
This is someone the Hawthornes know.

42:42.741 --> 42:44.908
I told you to leave.

42:44.910 --> 42:48.112
I'm sorry, Alison.

42:49.365 --> 42:52.699
But I can't do that.

43:06.434 --> 43:08.418
Many important issues are
on the ballot this year,

43:08.419 --> 43:10.269
but all eyes are on the race for mayor.

43:10.271 --> 43:12.738
It's been a wild ride
for Alison Hawthorne-Price.

43:12.740 --> 43:15.074
Her family's connection
to the Silver Bells case

43:15.076 --> 43:17.943
has threatened to overshadow
her innovative policy proposals

43:17.945 --> 43:19.612
and derail her campaign.

43:19.614 --> 43:21.947
But recent polls have her
within striking distance

43:21.949 --> 43:24.033
of incumbent Bill Conley.

43:24.035 --> 43:26.752
Will voters show up for her today?

43:41.269 --> 43:43.803
That policeman
stationed outside your house

43:43.805 --> 43:45.304
keeps driving over my flowerbeds.

43:45.306 --> 43:46.856
My nasturtiums have been decimated.

43:46.858 --> 43:49.141
That's yet another

43:49.143 --> 43:51.477
HOA infraction... your fifth.

43:51.479 --> 43:54.196
I'm sorry your flowers
are struggling, Phyllis.

43:54.198 --> 43:55.865
My family and I are receiving

43:55.867 --> 43:57.700
psychotic death threats from a killer.

43:57.702 --> 43:59.652
Well, I don't think that
cop in your driveway's

43:59.654 --> 44:01.120
gonna protect you, when I drove past him

44:01.122 --> 44:02.955
this morning, he
was asleep at the wheel.

44:10.464 --> 44:12.915
You're dismissed.

44:12.917 --> 44:15.301
But wait. Huh?

44:15.303 --> 44:16.669
I'm supposed to wait here

44:16.671 --> 44:19.672
and look for suspicious
characters and all that.

44:19.674 --> 44:22.424
You didn't notice him?

44:22.426 --> 44:23.926
Is he...?

44:23.928 --> 44:25.594
Sh-Should I arrest him?

44:25.596 --> 44:28.097
He's private security.

44:28.099 --> 44:32.067
A crazed doll maker seems intent
on killing my entire family.

44:32.069 --> 44:34.520
Instead of relying on
the C-minus protection

44:34.522 --> 44:36.188
of a narcoleptic beat cop,

44:36.190 --> 44:40.526
I decided to go with the
best that money could buy.

44:40.528 --> 44:42.745
Come on, Russo.

44:46.033 --> 44:49.034
I'm kind of rooting for the doll maker.

44:54.175 --> 44:56.842
Okay, you get a button, you get a flag.

44:56.844 --> 44:58.260
Thanks for being here.

44:58.262 --> 45:00.179
Cheers.

45:00.181 --> 45:01.630
Hey, you're flying solo.

45:01.632 --> 45:04.183
I thought maybe your
"friend" would be with you?

45:04.185 --> 45:06.435
Your implied ironic
quotation marks are unnecessary.

45:06.437 --> 45:08.971
April and I really are just friends.

45:08.973 --> 45:10.773
Hmm.

45:10.775 --> 45:12.391
All right, you're not supposed to date

45:12.393 --> 45:14.059
within the first
four months of recovery,

45:14.061 --> 45:18.280
so we are enjoying our year
of living... platonically.

45:18.282 --> 45:20.366
- Sounds like a long year.
- Hey, you made it.

45:20.368 --> 45:22.117
Yeah, just being supportive.

45:22.119 --> 45:25.018
Well, this seems like the safest
place for us to be right now.

45:25.143 --> 45:26.906
Alison brought in a lot
of extra security.

45:26.908 --> 45:29.241
Do you know how long it takes
to count all the votes?

45:29.243 --> 45:32.411
I think it's an all-day,
all-night kind of a thing.

45:32.413 --> 45:33.462
But it'll be fun.

45:33.464 --> 45:35.047
We got balloons! We got snacks!

45:35.049 --> 45:36.298
Oh, yeah.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.917
Come on, let's go wish Alison good luck.

45:37.919 --> 45:39.585
Oh, I think she's outside
giving interviews.

45:39.587 --> 45:41.337
No, I was just there. She's not there.

45:41.339 --> 45:44.390
She's not backstage either.

45:44.392 --> 45:46.976
Has anyone seen Alison
at all this morning?

45:52.600 --> 45:54.316
I lost her.

45:54.318 --> 45:58.854
I lost her because the hospital
prioritized patients with money.

46:00.658 --> 46:03.692
That never should've happened.

46:03.694 --> 46:07.196
Brigid should still be here.

46:07.198 --> 46:10.165
And now my daughter...

46:10.167 --> 46:13.786
she has to grow up without her mother.

46:13.788 --> 46:17.790
And someone has to answer for that.

46:17.792 --> 46:20.042
John Roy Martin gave
this deposition as part of

46:20.044 --> 46:23.545
a malpractice suit against
Fisher Hill Hospital in 1997.

46:23.547 --> 46:25.014
Hospital lawyers outmaneuvered him,

46:25.016 --> 46:26.799
and eventually the case was dismissed.

46:26.801 --> 46:30.469
Two years later, SBK's
first victim was killed.

46:30.471 --> 46:32.354
Brian Long... A wealthy entrepreneur

46:32.356 --> 46:35.140
who'd made a sizeable donation
to Fisher Hill Hospital.

46:35.142 --> 46:37.693
Now, these murders are
not a matter of making

46:37.695 --> 46:39.979
a general statement
about income inequality.

46:39.981 --> 46:42.731
They're about John and his
daughter Dara getting revenge.

46:44.201 --> 46:45.784
Escalating threats indicate

46:45.786 --> 46:48.988
that Dara's planning
to strike again. Soon.

46:48.990 --> 46:50.289
Hey.

46:50.291 --> 46:51.657
We can't find Alison.

46:51.659 --> 46:52.992
She's not picking up her phone,

46:52.994 --> 46:54.994
and she missed an interview
this morning.

46:54.996 --> 46:57.329
When was the last time someone saw her?

46:57.331 --> 46:59.548
A staffer saw her in
her office last night.

46:59.550 --> 47:00.966
But what if she's...

47:00.968 --> 47:03.085
What if the accomplice has got her?

47:03.087 --> 47:04.503
Tessa said

47:04.505 --> 47:06.221
she was at the office.

47:06.223 --> 47:07.639
What if the accomplice is someone

47:07.641 --> 47:09.258
who's worked her way
inside the campaign?

47:09.260 --> 47:11.477
Cutter, Ross.

47:12.897 --> 47:14.847
Alison Hawthorne's cell phone's off,

47:14.849 --> 47:17.683
but we were still able
to use locational data

47:17.685 --> 47:21.070
to pinpoint her last coordinates.

47:30.498 --> 47:32.247
Boston PD! Freeze!

47:32.249 --> 47:33.282
Hands in the air!

47:33.284 --> 47:35.417
Get down! Down on the...

47:35.419 --> 47:37.086
Brady?

47:40.508 --> 47:42.291
What the hell?

47:42.293 --> 47:44.126
For the last month,

47:44.128 --> 47:47.262
I have been secretly working
with the dockworkers' union.

47:47.264 --> 47:49.576
What is your Social Security number?

47:50.569 --> 47:53.135
I thought the union
was in Conley's pocket.

47:53.137 --> 47:56.105
But last night, Naomi told me
I could swing their vote my way

47:56.107 --> 47:57.773
if I could guarantee
favorable arbitration

47:57.775 --> 48:00.392
in the next
negotiation with the shippers.

48:00.394 --> 48:02.611
We started hammering out
the details last night.

48:02.613 --> 48:04.530
It took a little longer than I expected.

48:04.532 --> 48:05.781
But, Alice,

48:05.783 --> 48:08.117
some lunatic is targeting you right now.

48:08.119 --> 48:10.119
You can't just sneak off
to some secret warehouse

48:10.121 --> 48:11.370
without telling anyone.

48:11.372 --> 48:12.738
I was with Naomi the whole time.

48:12.740 --> 48:14.873
Yeah, well, for all we know,
Naomi could be that lunatic.

48:14.875 --> 48:16.458
We've determined

48:16.460 --> 48:17.876
that the accomplice is SBK's daughter,

48:17.878 --> 48:19.995
and we know that she's
in her early 30s now.

48:19.997 --> 48:21.630
- You think Naomi...?
- No.

48:21.632 --> 48:23.916
I just did a quick background check.

48:23.918 --> 48:26.001
She is and always has been Naomi Flynn.

48:26.003 --> 48:27.419
Both parents still living.

48:27.421 --> 48:28.754
Can't be her.

48:28.756 --> 48:31.507
We had to chase her down.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.258
In the meantime,

48:33.260 --> 48:35.844
the Bureau's got people
looking for something on Dara.

48:35.846 --> 48:37.429
School photos, juvie records...

48:37.431 --> 48:38.931
They won't find anything.

48:38.933 --> 48:41.483
Martin did a good job of keeping
himself off the grid.

48:41.485 --> 48:43.769
It's even easier to
keep a child off the grid.

48:43.771 --> 48:45.771
It's the digital age, Ross.

48:45.773 --> 48:48.357
Everybody's got a record
of existence somewhere.

48:48.359 --> 48:50.859
You know, we keep thinking
of Dara as being ruthless

48:50.861 --> 48:53.579
and methodical, but you know
what, she's also emotional.

48:53.581 --> 48:55.914
This is someone whose
whole raison d'Ãªtre

48:55.916 --> 48:58.617
is avenging the loss of her mother.

48:58.619 --> 49:00.419
"Raison d'Ãªtre"?

49:00.421 --> 49:01.620
Yeah, "reason for being."

49:01.622 --> 49:03.288
No, I-I know what it means.

49:03.290 --> 49:05.174
I...

49:05.176 --> 49:08.260
Just never thought of you
as a French phrase kind of guy.

49:08.262 --> 49:10.796
All I'm saying is Dara
probably pays her mother

49:10.798 --> 49:13.932
a visit from time to time,
so maybe we should, too.

49:16.854 --> 49:19.054
That would make sense.

49:22.109 --> 49:24.393
I'm so sorry for the delay.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.311
Thank you all for being here.

49:26.313 --> 49:28.814
I know it hasn't been easy,

49:28.816 --> 49:30.449
but here we are.

49:30.451 --> 49:32.034
We made it. We're still standing.

49:32.036 --> 49:35.988
And that's entirely due
to your unflagging loyalty,

49:35.990 --> 49:37.956
hard work and tenacity.

49:37.958 --> 49:41.493
You held tight to the mission
all the way to the end.

49:41.495 --> 49:43.462
Many of us have been in this fight

49:43.464 --> 49:45.964
together since the
beginning, and I'm thrilled

49:45.966 --> 49:48.550
- to have this opportunity...
- Hey.

49:48.552 --> 49:51.303
Um, I got your letter.

49:51.305 --> 49:53.589
Can we go somewhere to talk?

49:53.591 --> 49:56.508
I'm proud of the campaign we ran.

49:56.510 --> 49:59.344
And I'm eternally
thankful for all of you

49:59.346 --> 50:00.979
for sticking by me the whole way.

50:00.981 --> 50:01.980
Thank you.

50:05.352 --> 50:09.154
Ali, we can't stick by you
unless we know where you are.

50:09.156 --> 50:11.023
I'm so sorry for worrying you guys.

50:11.025 --> 50:12.858
I just had to make one final maneuver.

50:12.860 --> 50:15.944
Okay, but next time, charge your
cell phone when you maneuver.

50:15.946 --> 50:18.113
Fair enough.

50:18.949 --> 50:20.415
You okay?

50:20.417 --> 50:22.751
I'm just nervous.

50:22.753 --> 50:25.120
We're safe here. I promise you.

50:25.122 --> 50:27.005
There's security guards everywhere,

50:27.007 --> 50:28.207
metal detectors at the door.

50:28.209 --> 50:29.925
Except that the person targeting us

50:29.927 --> 50:31.793
doesn't need a gun or a knife.

50:31.795 --> 50:33.428
Just a belt.

50:57.571 --> 50:59.571
Expecting someone?

50:59.573 --> 51:00.572
No.

51:14.471 --> 51:16.338
Who are you?

51:16.340 --> 51:18.340
I'm Sophie.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.891
Cam's wife.

51:21.595 --> 51:25.154
Please tell Hercules
I'm your daughter-in-law.

51:26.433 --> 51:28.183
You can let her in.

51:33.240 --> 51:34.823
Former daughter-in-law.

51:34.825 --> 51:36.525
Yeah.

51:36.527 --> 51:38.160
You won.

51:38.162 --> 51:39.828
He kicked me out for good.

51:39.830 --> 51:42.864
I won't fight your lawyer on custody.

51:42.866 --> 51:45.951
I'm leaving town.

51:45.953 --> 51:48.787
Cam has some of my photos
of Jack in his room.

51:48.789 --> 51:50.422
I was hoping to grab them.

51:54.378 --> 51:56.345
Please?

51:58.966 --> 52:00.799
It's just some pictures.

52:00.801 --> 52:02.851
And I'll be out of your life.

52:04.688 --> 52:06.521
You can follow her upstairs.

52:06.523 --> 52:09.608
Make sure the photos are all she takes.

52:20.537 --> 52:22.120
Thank you.

52:25.626 --> 52:27.326
What's wrong?

52:27.328 --> 52:29.411
Why are you out here?

52:29.413 --> 52:34.166
I'm worried my brain isn't
going to develop correctly.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.003
What makes you say that?

52:38.005 --> 52:41.256
Studies show that hearing
your mother's voice

52:41.258 --> 52:44.509
releases neuropeptides into your brain.

52:44.511 --> 52:47.679
And those help develop
social communication skills.

52:47.681 --> 52:50.649
And I need those.

52:50.651 --> 52:54.403
You won't even let me see her anymore.

52:54.405 --> 52:57.656
I don't even have that stupid
bear Uncle Garrett gave me.

52:57.658 --> 53:00.158
She recorded a message for me on it,

53:00.160 --> 53:02.361
and you made us leave Grandma's so fast

53:02.363 --> 53:04.279
I didn't even get to grab it.

53:07.835 --> 53:10.419
Hang tight, buddy.
I'll get that bear for you.

53:11.505 --> 53:13.338
Be right back.

53:15.709 --> 53:19.461
I know I should've told you
all that a long time ago.

53:19.463 --> 53:22.264
Yeah, but, um...

53:22.266 --> 53:24.599
I'm glad I know everything now.

53:24.601 --> 53:27.936
I'm glad I know my father was
standing up for what's right.

53:30.357 --> 53:32.474
In the room, when we talked,

53:32.476 --> 53:33.942
and on the phone,

53:33.944 --> 53:36.728
when you told me you were pregnant...

53:36.730 --> 53:40.732
I thought maybe there
might be a chance for us.

53:44.488 --> 53:45.954
Maybe there could be.

53:45.956 --> 53:47.572
Could be?

53:47.574 --> 53:49.574
But I can't stay here.

53:49.576 --> 53:52.127
Too many bad memories.

53:52.129 --> 53:53.545
I got a job.

53:53.547 --> 53:55.247
Starts next week.

53:55.249 --> 53:57.916
San Francisco.

53:57.918 --> 54:00.168
We could give this a shot.

54:02.973 --> 54:04.589
Just not here.

54:10.264 --> 54:12.647
I don't think I can leave
my family again.

54:12.649 --> 54:14.983
Just not with
everything that's going on.

54:14.985 --> 54:17.486
Oh.

54:18.989 --> 54:23.358
Is there any chance I
could get you to stay?

54:25.779 --> 54:27.245
No.

54:35.205 --> 54:36.838
Here it is.

54:38.592 --> 54:41.460
Can't remember anybody coming by.

54:41.462 --> 54:44.763
Although I don't make
a habit of staring.

54:44.765 --> 54:48.016
I try and keep my peepers to myself.

54:49.803 --> 54:51.520
Any surveillance on the premises?

54:51.522 --> 54:52.938
Visitor's records maybe?

54:52.940 --> 54:55.807
We don't get many visitors.

54:55.809 --> 54:59.861
Truthfully, I'm not sure people
like cemeteries all that much.

55:06.820 --> 55:09.321
I'm sorry I made us drive
all the way out here.

55:09.323 --> 55:10.956
Ah.

55:10.958 --> 55:12.574
It was worth a try.

55:17.798 --> 55:19.998
Early reports show
incumbent mayor Bill Conley

55:20.000 --> 55:22.834
ahead by a razor-thin
margin of 1,200 votes.

55:22.836 --> 55:24.503
That margin could very easily

55:24.505 --> 55:26.171
be overtaken by Hawthorne-Price,

55:26.173 --> 55:28.473
who campaigned hard in several
suburban districts...

55:28.475 --> 55:29.508
Russo?

55:29.510 --> 55:30.842
...which are yet to be counted.

55:30.844 --> 55:32.394
At this point in the day,

55:32.396 --> 55:34.062
Conley's team has to be surprised...

55:37.267 --> 55:39.484
Someone's at the door!

55:43.774 --> 55:45.240
Russo?

55:51.248 --> 55:54.416
Madeline, the HOA meeting
is about to start.

55:58.171 --> 56:00.338
Ross? You coming?

56:01.792 --> 56:03.258
Ross!

56:04.962 --> 56:06.428
You okay?

56:07.848 --> 56:11.600
If you're standing right here,
paying your respects,

56:11.602 --> 56:13.018
you'd look up...

56:14.771 --> 56:18.023
...and you'd see the cherry blossoms.

56:23.030 --> 56:25.230
I think I know who Dara is.

56:40.881 --> 56:42.714
However, I know your family

56:42.716 --> 56:44.916
has been through a series
of crises lately.

56:44.918 --> 56:47.636
It would be unfair for us to judge you

56:47.638 --> 56:49.588
without hearing your side of the story.

56:49.590 --> 56:50.805
Come on.

56:52.092 --> 56:55.093
You want me to go with you?

56:55.095 --> 56:58.096
Oh, I give you the benefit of the doubt.

56:58.098 --> 57:00.315
That's a hard no.

57:05.906 --> 57:07.355
There you are.

57:09.076 --> 57:10.775
Here I am.

57:10.777 --> 57:12.777
Did you get everything you wanted?

57:14.498 --> 57:17.282
Well, I wanted my family.

57:17.284 --> 57:19.868
Cam and Jack, but...

57:19.870 --> 57:22.871
you ruined that for me.

57:22.873 --> 57:24.589
Turned Cam against me.

57:26.593 --> 57:29.010
You did that all by yourself.

57:29.012 --> 57:30.462
Mm...

57:30.464 --> 57:31.763
No.

57:31.765 --> 57:33.181
It was you.

57:34.718 --> 57:37.302
You know, parents have
such a big influence

57:37.304 --> 57:38.553
on their children.

57:38.555 --> 57:41.139
I know my father had

57:41.141 --> 57:43.308
a huge impact on me.

57:47.114 --> 57:48.697
Do you know who my father was,

57:48.699 --> 57:50.315
Madeline?

57:50.317 --> 57:51.566
No.

57:51.568 --> 57:53.034
No.

57:55.072 --> 57:58.039
He was an artist, too.

57:58.041 --> 58:01.710
Very... avant-garde.

58:01.712 --> 58:04.379
Very controversial.

58:08.635 --> 58:10.335
And I helped him.

58:10.337 --> 58:12.554
That's sweet.

58:12.556 --> 58:15.090
Russo!

58:15.092 --> 58:17.008
He's not coming.

58:43.950 --> 58:45.366
Sophie...

58:45.368 --> 58:46.617
Not my name.

58:46.619 --> 58:48.235
Please don't do this.

58:57.964 --> 59:00.381
You know, when my father
came into this house,

59:00.383 --> 59:02.633
he was all I had left.

59:02.635 --> 59:04.301
My mom died when I was ten.

59:04.303 --> 59:06.754
I adored her.

59:06.756 --> 59:11.141
And then... I lost her.

59:11.143 --> 59:13.510
You know what that's like?

59:13.512 --> 59:15.763
That kind of loss?

59:15.765 --> 59:17.431
The kind that...

59:17.433 --> 59:19.316
rips your insides out?

59:22.104 --> 59:24.905
'Cause that was me and my dad.

59:24.907 --> 59:27.157
Because it shouldn't have happened.

59:28.661 --> 59:30.911
We were in a car accident.

59:30.913 --> 59:33.163
She had two surgeries,

59:33.165 --> 59:35.332
five weeks in the hospital.

59:35.334 --> 59:37.668
First-class hospital, supposedly.

59:37.670 --> 59:39.036
They hardly ever

59:39.038 --> 59:40.454
checked on her.

59:40.456 --> 59:43.123
My dad and I kept telling the doctors

59:43.125 --> 59:45.509
and nurses that something was wrong.

59:45.511 --> 59:47.127
You know, she was out of it.

59:47.129 --> 59:49.630
Disoriented.

59:53.519 --> 59:55.469
But they said she was fine.

59:55.471 --> 59:57.471
No special tests

59:57.473 --> 59:59.023
or second opinions,

59:59.025 --> 01:00:00.557
no.

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:02.109
Not for us.

01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:07.197
They said it was just side
effects from the medication.

01:00:12.204 --> 01:00:14.238
It was septic shock.

01:00:18.794 --> 01:00:20.711
By the time they figured it out,

01:00:20.713 --> 01:00:22.629
it was too far gone.

01:00:24.467 --> 01:00:25.749
The rich patients,

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:28.836
the ones with money and...

01:00:28.838 --> 01:00:30.337
connections, well,

01:00:30.339 --> 01:00:31.805
they were given special tests,

01:00:31.807 --> 01:00:34.091
state-of-the-art equipment.

01:00:34.093 --> 01:00:35.843
Did you know those patients

01:00:35.845 --> 01:00:37.895
were actually given
special blue blankets

01:00:37.897 --> 01:00:39.980
so the staff knows to treat them better?

01:00:46.355 --> 01:00:47.821
Of course you do.

01:00:50.159 --> 01:00:52.526
As we sat

01:00:52.528 --> 01:00:56.029
and watched as she slipped away...

01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:04.621
...something in me

01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:07.007
cracked.

01:01:07.009 --> 01:01:09.460
In my dad, too.

01:01:14.049 --> 01:01:16.133
So...

01:01:16.135 --> 01:01:18.635
we started a list.

01:01:18.637 --> 01:01:21.305
There was an easy place to start.

01:01:23.476 --> 01:01:26.527
The rich donors who helped
create that divide.

01:01:32.485 --> 01:01:34.535
And so...

01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:37.204
his mission began.

01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:42.242
Borrowed a car from a family friend.

01:01:45.381 --> 01:01:49.133
Learned how to break
into big, lavish mansions.

01:01:49.135 --> 01:01:51.301
I was good at it; I still am.

01:01:55.641 --> 01:01:57.391
Hey. â€­

01:01:57.393 --> 01:01:58.842
Geez!

01:01:58.844 --> 01:02:01.094
How the hell'd you get in here?

01:02:03.816 --> 01:02:06.517
Your father took you with him
when he committed murder?

01:02:09.655 --> 01:02:12.906
You're not exactly in a position
to judge parenting skills.

01:02:14.994 --> 01:02:17.027
My father went in first.

01:02:18.164 --> 01:02:19.997
Made sure it was safe.

01:02:21.667 --> 01:02:24.001
I'd stay in the car.

01:02:26.539 --> 01:02:28.205
Wait for my signal

01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:29.756
and then come in.

01:02:29.758 --> 01:02:32.593
Okay.

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.014
Then...

01:02:37.016 --> 01:02:38.432
when he was done,

01:02:38.434 --> 01:02:40.884
I'd help him clean up, help him

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.135
set the scene,

01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:43.887
create the tableau.

01:02:44.773 --> 01:02:47.808
And finally...

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:50.110
place the bell.

01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:56.033
The one thing they
could've used to call for help with.

01:02:56.035 --> 01:02:58.068
Just out of reach.

01:03:00.823 --> 01:03:03.790
Like it was for us.

01:03:05.077 --> 01:03:06.793
What do you want from me?

01:03:06.795 --> 01:03:08.128
I'll give you anything you want.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:09.580
Shut up!

01:03:09.582 --> 01:03:11.882
Shut... up.

01:03:11.884 --> 01:03:13.917
My father came into this house,

01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:15.886
and he never left!

01:03:15.888 --> 01:03:18.805
I waited for the cops to come find me.

01:03:18.807 --> 01:03:21.091
Or to hear my father's name on the news,

01:03:21.093 --> 01:03:23.594
but nothing ever happened.

01:03:23.596 --> 01:03:27.064
Because you never called
the cops, did you?

01:03:27.066 --> 01:03:28.565
No.

01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:31.685
You used my father,

01:03:31.687 --> 01:03:33.186
his name,

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:35.072
his signature,

01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:38.025
his legacy

01:03:38.027 --> 01:03:41.078
to get rid of your own enemies.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.413
And suddenly...

01:03:43.415 --> 01:03:47.251
well, suddenly, I was an orphan.

01:03:49.672 --> 01:03:52.706
And you know what?

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:56.843
That same family friend

01:03:56.845 --> 01:03:58.545
took me in.

01:03:59.965 --> 01:04:02.883
I didn't want to kill her.

01:04:02.885 --> 01:04:05.435
But...

01:04:05.437 --> 01:04:07.721
the cops were getting too close.

01:04:07.723 --> 01:04:10.390
You know, if they questioned her again,

01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:12.309
she may have slipped.

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:16.113
She may have mentioned my name.

01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:18.615
So I tried to make it
as quick as possible,

01:04:18.617 --> 01:04:21.735
because she didn't deserve to suffer.

01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:23.820
I can help you.

01:04:23.822 --> 01:04:25.072
Li-Listen to me.

01:04:25.074 --> 01:04:26.990
Shut up.

01:04:26.992 --> 01:04:29.660
- I can help you.
- Shut... up.

01:04:29.662 --> 01:04:31.962
Let me help you.

01:04:31.964 --> 01:04:33.664
You need money.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:35.415
I can give you that. Oh.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.418
- $500,000.
- â€­

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.504
It's in Mitchell's mausoleum space.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:42.472
Sophie, untie me

01:04:42.474 --> 01:04:43.974
and I can give you the key!

01:04:47.763 --> 01:04:50.096
Strength comes from doing what's...

01:04:50.121 --> 01:04:51.048
Just grabbing something

01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:53.517
for Jack, Mom. Just
pretend I'm not here.

01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:56.069
Be in and out in a second.

01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:08.665
He misses me, doesn't he?

01:05:08.667 --> 01:05:11.168
What are you doing here?

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:13.453
Whoa!

01:05:13.455 --> 01:05:16.456
Who the hell is that? I
didn't want you to know.

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:18.875
Sophie, what are you doing?

01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:19.960
I have to finish.

01:05:19.962 --> 01:05:22.012
Finish what?!

01:05:22.014 --> 01:05:24.965
What my father started.

01:05:26.685 --> 01:05:29.469
You.

01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:31.805
It's you. â€­

01:05:31.807 --> 01:05:36.109
You were just supposed to be
my way into the family, Cam.

01:05:36.111 --> 01:05:38.228
You know, before I knew who she was,

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:41.314
I kept seeing her around
at different places.

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.400
Coffee shop,

01:05:43.402 --> 01:05:44.651
movies.

01:05:44.653 --> 01:05:46.403
And then this one day in the park...

01:05:46.405 --> 01:05:48.121
When she just popped up in front of you

01:05:48.123 --> 01:05:50.374
- and...
- And said, "Hi, I'm Sophie,

01:05:50.376 --> 01:05:52.242
and I'm gonna be your girlfriend."

01:05:52.244 --> 01:05:54.494
She was right.

01:05:54.496 --> 01:05:56.496
Then I fell in love.

01:05:58.717 --> 01:06:01.501
And we had this unique,
amazing child together.

01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:04.638
I wanted you more than I wanted revenge.

01:06:06.892 --> 01:06:10.343
Could've stayed that way,
but you told me it was over.

01:06:10.345 --> 01:06:13.430
You told me I was
never gonna see my son again.

01:06:13.432 --> 01:06:15.098
Now all I have left is revenge.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.316
Sophie!

01:06:16.318 --> 01:06:17.818
No!

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.520
Sophie!

01:06:20.522 --> 01:06:22.439
Sophie!

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:29.830
Come on, buddy.

01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:05.949
This is getting exciting.

01:07:05.951 --> 01:07:08.985
Naomi says it's neck and neck.

01:07:10.405 --> 01:07:12.823
Hey, uh...

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:14.458
I just saw Christina.

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.326
Oh, yeah?

01:07:16.328 --> 01:07:18.879
Yeah. Um...

01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:21.798
she's got a new job
in-in San Francisco,

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.468
and... she wants me to go.

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:27.504
Oh, wow.

01:07:27.506 --> 01:07:28.889
Your phone is ringing.

01:07:28.891 --> 01:07:31.308
Oh.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:32.293
Hey.

01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:34.344
Tess, I've been trying to reach you.

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:35.479
Have you seen Sophie?

01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:36.596
She anywhere near you?

01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:37.763
What? No, Sophie's not here.

01:07:37.764 --> 01:07:39.576
- Why?
- It's her, Tess.

01:07:39.705 --> 01:07:41.038
She's SBK's daughter.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.456
She's the accomplice.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.990
That can't be right, Brady.

01:07:43.992 --> 01:07:45.659
Are you in a safe place right now?

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:48.495
I mean, yeah, I'm-I'm
with Alison and Garrett

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.797
and guards and cops
and hundreds of other...

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:52.382
Cam.

01:07:52.384 --> 01:07:55.419
Cam went back to the house
to get something for Jack.

01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:57.901
Will you check in with the cop
assigned to the Hawthorne house?

01:07:58.807 --> 01:08:00.257
He's been gone a while.

01:08:00.259 --> 01:08:01.842
And Mom is there, too.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.747
I'm at the station.

01:08:03.903 --> 01:08:06.012
Why the hell aren't you
at the Hawthorne house?

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:08.398
Detail was lifted at the
request of the homeowner.

01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:11.568
Okay, Tess, listen to me,

01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:13.403
I need you to stay put.

01:08:13.405 --> 01:08:15.188
I'm gonna go check on Cam and your mom.

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:17.524
Okay.

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:20.327
Tess, you okay?

01:08:22.915 --> 01:08:24.531
It's Sophie.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.700
Sophie is the accomplice.

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:29.002
Brady's going to the
house to check on Cam.

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:31.671
And Mom.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.841
I'm going.

01:08:34.843 --> 01:08:37.627
Wait, Brady said to stay...

01:08:37.629 --> 01:08:39.179
Excuse me.

01:08:40.966 --> 01:08:43.265
Cam? Cam!

01:08:43.268 --> 01:08:45.385
He can't help you.

01:09:10.328 --> 01:09:12.578
You know, you're right.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:15.549
We treated you unfairly.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:19.219
So-so let me fix it.

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.720
You want Jack?

01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:23.423
I can make that happen.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.640
I can call the lawyers.

01:09:24.643 --> 01:09:26.009
Right now.

01:09:26.011 --> 01:09:27.477
Retract everything.

01:09:45.663 --> 01:09:48.415
I can speak to the judge myself.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:51.667
I can tell him that...

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:54.087
Jack needs you in his life.

01:09:55.707 --> 01:09:58.124
Not just supervised visits.

01:09:58.126 --> 01:09:59.342
Shared custody.

01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:03.763
I can say whatever you want me to.

01:10:03.765 --> 01:10:05.715
You'd do that?

01:10:08.387 --> 01:10:09.853
Yes.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:19.529
Yeah, right.

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:44.137
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:11:03.108 --> 01:11:04.691
Sophie!

01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:06.993
You're too late.

01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:26.030
How could you?

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.866
She was poison, Cam.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.491
You're insane.

01:11:36.493 --> 01:11:38.910
I'm not gonna hurt anyone else.

01:11:38.912 --> 01:11:40.495
I promise you, I'm leaving town.

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:41.712
You'll never see me again.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:45.967
I let you into our family.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.585
I have to stop you.

01:11:47.587 --> 01:11:49.170
Don't do it, Cam.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.639
Don't do it.

01:11:53.092 --> 01:11:55.113
Cam, listen to me.

01:11:55.295 --> 01:11:58.262
I've lived with someone's blood
on my hands for a long time.

01:11:58.264 --> 01:11:59.931
You don't want that.

01:11:59.933 --> 01:12:02.099
I don't care. It'll eat at you.

01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:04.268
It'll haunt you.

01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:07.522
Little brother, I don't want
you to have to live that way.

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:09.490
Listen to him, Cam. Shut up!

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.775
Shut up! â€­I don't...

01:12:10.777 --> 01:12:12.827
Okay, okay, but think.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.162
You're gonna go to prison.

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:15.830
What's gonna happen to Jack?

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:19.750
Jack deserves better than us.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.597
She was just here. She went that way.

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:33.798
Go! Find her!

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.516
- Find her!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:12:58.491 --> 01:13:00.157
It means so much
that you're here. Really,

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:01.409
it was such a generous contribution.

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.044
Excuse me.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:04.629
What? â€­I can't believe it.

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:07.999
I just got a heads-up
from my friend at WXQN.

01:13:08.001 --> 01:13:09.584
They're about to call the election.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:11.669
Our play for the union worked; you won.

01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:14.672
- You are the new mayor of Boston.
- â€­

01:13:14.674 --> 01:13:16.924
With 98% of the vote now counted,

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:20.344
we can call the race for
mayor here in Boston.

01:13:20.346 --> 01:13:22.680
Challenger Alison Hawthorne-Price

01:13:22.682 --> 01:13:25.182
has won the incredibly close race.

01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:29.570
This is because of you.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:32.156
I just helped everyone see the truth.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:33.908
You deserve it.

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:37.945
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.831
I would like to introduce to you

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.333
the mayor of Boston,

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.002
Alison Hawthorne-Price!

01:15:55.912 --> 01:15:57.362
I missed it.

01:15:59.416 --> 01:16:01.165
How did I miss it? How?

01:16:01.167 --> 01:16:02.417
I mean, I...

01:16:02.419 --> 01:16:04.535
I've known her...

01:16:04.537 --> 01:16:07.588
I've known her for years.

01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:11.759
Come on. No one sees
their own family clearly.

01:16:12.846 --> 01:16:14.679
Hey, now we know what she looks like.

01:16:14.681 --> 01:16:16.597
Next time she shows her face in public,

01:16:16.599 --> 01:16:18.466
we'll get her, thanks to you.

01:16:18.468 --> 01:16:20.301
Yeah, but she's still out there.

01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:25.390
17 years this thing went unsolved.

01:16:25.392 --> 01:16:30.361
But your incredibly annoying persistence

01:16:30.363 --> 01:16:34.565
and pathological inability
to let anything go,

01:16:34.567 --> 01:16:37.285
that's what finally got us answers.

01:16:39.122 --> 01:16:41.239
Touché.

01:16:41.241 --> 01:16:43.291
Again with the French.

01:16:55.638 --> 01:16:57.054
Recording of you and Conley.

01:16:57.056 --> 01:16:58.890
Only copy.

01:17:01.144 --> 01:17:03.094
You sure?

01:17:03.471 --> 01:17:06.021
You could hold this
over my head forever.

01:17:07.475 --> 01:17:08.941
Yeah, but...

01:17:11.312 --> 01:17:13.562
...couldn't do that to my partner.

01:17:20.705 --> 01:17:22.872
You know what? This whole time,

01:17:22.874 --> 01:17:25.875
I was worried that Jack
had psychopathic genes,

01:17:25.877 --> 01:17:28.661
that his grandfather was SBK.

01:17:28.663 --> 01:17:30.830
I mean... I mean, he was.

01:17:30.832 --> 01:17:34.049
It was his other grandfather.

01:17:34.051 --> 01:17:35.668
Jack'll be okay.

01:17:37.421 --> 01:17:38.888
He's got you.

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:41.090
He's got all of us. He'll be okay.

01:17:43.094 --> 01:17:45.060
You're sticking around?

01:17:45.062 --> 01:17:46.679
What about Christina?

01:17:46.681 --> 01:17:48.848
What about San Francisco?

01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:51.267
I can't leave you guys.

01:17:53.354 --> 01:17:55.404
Yes, you can.

01:17:57.108 --> 01:17:58.407
You have to.

01:17:58.409 --> 01:18:00.442
No, I've got five years' probation.

01:18:00.444 --> 01:18:02.695
They're not even gonna
let me out of the state.

01:18:04.665 --> 01:18:08.417
They would if the mayor talks
to your probation officer.

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:15.090
Promise us that you'll go.

01:18:15.092 --> 01:18:17.176
Be happy.

01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:34.109
Well, I guess she likes beets.

01:18:34.111 --> 01:18:35.895
â€­Hard to say.

01:18:35.897 --> 01:18:37.613
I don't know if she
got any in her mouth.

01:18:37.615 --> 01:18:39.448
Hey, my baby.

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:41.817
What did you think? â€­

01:18:41.819 --> 01:18:43.035
Good girl, Mia.

01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:47.373
Hey!

01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:49.909
Yes, can't wait. Is your flight on time?

01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:53.412
Great. I'll let Cam know, too. Bye!

01:18:53.414 --> 01:18:54.830
Okay, we'll see you there.

01:18:54.832 --> 01:18:56.465
Okay, bye.

01:18:59.337 --> 01:19:00.920
Noon.

01:19:02.723 --> 01:19:05.891
It's officially been one year.

01:19:08.062 --> 01:19:09.561
Wow.

01:19:09.563 --> 01:19:12.431
We made it.

01:19:12.433 --> 01:19:14.233
Now, I-I don't know

01:19:14.235 --> 01:19:16.852
if we need to rush into anything.

01:19:17.855 --> 01:19:19.688
You know.

01:19:25.913 --> 01:19:27.112
Do you see Dana?

01:19:27.114 --> 01:19:28.497
You see her up there?

01:19:28.499 --> 01:19:30.282
Say hi. Hey.

01:19:30.284 --> 01:19:32.251
- Say, "Hey, Dana."
- Yeah.

01:21:11.719 --> 01:21:14.186
Don't worry, I'll see you again soon.

01:21:15.606 --> 01:21:18.390
Don't worry, I'll see you again soon.

01:21:18.392 --> 01:21:21.110
Don't worry, I'll see you again soon.

01:21:26.033 --> 01:21:27.449
When?

01:21:32.406 --> 01:21:33.739
Here we are,

01:21:33.741 --> 01:21:35.707
a year into your first term.

01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:38.327
Which most would call
a resounding success.

01:21:38.329 --> 01:21:39.912
You've implemented

01:21:39.914 --> 01:21:41.463
an effective gun buyback program,

01:21:41.465 --> 01:21:43.482
increased funding for arts and music,

01:21:43.612 --> 01:21:45.467
and stoked the local economy.

01:21:45.469 --> 01:21:48.837
What's the secret for
coming out of the gate so strong?

01:21:50.007 --> 01:21:52.007
Well, I'm thorough to a fault.

01:21:52.009 --> 01:21:53.592
I pay attention.

01:21:53.594 --> 01:21:55.644
It's trite but true...

01:21:55.646 --> 01:21:57.429
The devil's in the details.

01:22:07.775 --> 01:22:10.325
Doesn't seem like your husband's type.

01:22:25.126 --> 01:22:26.925
I know it's you.

01:22:26.927 --> 01:22:29.795
You're the accomplice.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:35.934
The wallpaper in your self-portraits?

01:22:35.936 --> 01:22:38.854
It's from the blind lady's house.

01:22:38.856 --> 01:22:40.639
You must have known her pretty well.

01:22:40.641 --> 01:22:44.476
Well enough to get her to
cover for you and your dad.

01:22:44.478 --> 01:22:46.445
Well enough to bring over

01:22:46.447 --> 01:22:48.897
a program from my father's funeral.

01:22:51.068 --> 01:22:53.619
It all adds up.

01:22:53.621 --> 01:22:55.487
Of course,

01:22:55.489 --> 01:22:57.656
you haven't been
without your detractors.

01:22:57.658 --> 01:22:59.158
True.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.210
But I've learned to turn an adversary

01:23:01.212 --> 01:23:03.295
into an ally.

01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:15.224
If I go to the police,

01:23:15.226 --> 01:23:17.509
you'll spend your life in prison.

01:23:20.848 --> 01:23:22.648
I know what happened

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:25.150
the night your father
came into our house.

01:23:27.738 --> 01:23:30.989
You don't need to target all of us.

01:23:30.991 --> 01:23:32.991
Just my mother.

01:23:32.993 --> 01:23:36.578
She orchestrated everything.

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:39.081
The cover-up of your father's death,

01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:42.251
killing David Morales
and Jennifer Windham...

01:23:42.253 --> 01:23:43.835
You want revenge.

01:23:45.873 --> 01:23:49.258
And you want to remove a liability.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:52.544
Protect the rest of your family.

01:23:53.881 --> 01:23:56.515
So you see the elegance
of this solution.

01:24:06.343 --> 01:24:07.943
Much has been made

01:24:07.945 --> 01:24:10.312
of your family's involvement
in the Silver Bells case.

01:24:10.314 --> 01:24:14.149
Your mother's killer is still at large.

01:24:14.151 --> 01:24:15.784
How do you cope with that?

01:24:15.786 --> 01:24:18.737
I learned from my mother

01:24:18.739 --> 01:24:21.490
that you can choose to live in fear

01:24:21.492 --> 01:24:23.792
or you can move forward.

01:24:23.794 --> 01:24:27.079
You can be a victim
of your circumstances

01:24:27.081 --> 01:24:30.916
or you can summon the strength
to push through no matter what.

01:24:31.752 --> 01:24:34.219
Today, our family is thriving.

01:24:37.424 --> 01:24:39.651
I think my mother would be proud.
