<i>Maybe she's gay.</i>

02:53.373 --> 02:55.175
That's so sad.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.510
It is sad.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.597
-Oh, yeah, I saved you. Run!
-Run, Mommy.

09:33.005 --> 09:35.675
It's just,
I've been kind of putting it off.

09:35.741 --> 09:39.812
It's just been a lot of, you know,
working and busy and crazy.

09:47.887 --> 09:51.457
Kourtney has been torturing me
all day about my mom.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.693
She wants me to go visit my mom

09:53.759 --> 09:56.028
because my mom
hasn't been feeling very good.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.045
My mom died when I was 13.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.247
-No.
-She was a nurse, going to work,

10:15.314 --> 10:18.484
and somebody was drinking and driving.
You just never know.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.188
You know, tomorrow's justâ€¦

15:31.297 --> 15:33.532
-Sure.
-Do I have food in my teeth?

35:21.519 --> 35:24.288
He goes, "But I'm not 100 percent."

35:45.443 --> 35:46.911
Will you check and see?

35:46.978 --> 35:49.147
I feel like
there's a lot of magic happening.

39:17.154 --> 39:20.858
His head is almost out. There it is.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.494
There you go, his head's out.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.296
That's crazy.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.288
How are you doing, Kourtney?

40:40.938 --> 40:43.974
-Are you ever going to forget this day?
-No.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.210
Looks like your placenta
wants to come out soon.
