00:07.174 --> 00:10.636
<i>Since the beginning,
beings loved to gaze at the stars.</i>

00:10.636 --> 00:16.225
<i>They even found shapes in them.
Pincho. Scratchi. Swimbu. Dupes.</i>

00:16.934 --> 00:20.354
<i>Beings mapped every bright light
they could see in the night sky.</i>

00:21.647 --> 00:23.899
<i>But the brightest lights
are not stars at all.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:26.360
<i>Our two moons.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.905
<i>"MOON" stands for
"Miniature Orb Orbiting Nearby."</i>

00:29.905 --> 00:34.034
<i>Left orb, or "Lorb" for short,
orbits our planet like this.</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.870
<i>While Rorb, right orb, orbits it like so.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.122
<i>Once every 15 trips around our star,</i>

00:39.122 --> 00:44.044
<i>these two moons align with our planet
and create a spectacular eclipse.</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:48.215
<i>It's widely said that these two moons
in alignment can cause erratic behavior</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.551
<i>and will coincide
with an unexpected alignment</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:51.760
<i>in your personal life.</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:54.471
<i>And it all happens today because it's...</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Double Shadow Day!

01:02.354 --> 01:05.107
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

01:05.107 --> 01:06.900
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

01:07.693 --> 01:10.362
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:11.989
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

01:12.948 --> 01:15.200
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:18.161
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:20.497
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

01:20.497 --> 01:23.166
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

01:23.166 --> 01:25.335
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:39.224
I'm so glad you could do a morning date
before work.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.060
Are you kidding? I wish I could just spend
the whole day here.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.437
Gelatinous predator?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.772
They're delicious,
but they stick to my mouthstones.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.734
<i>The eclipse isn't visible from--</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:52.487
Uh-oh.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.742
Okay, sorry.
They told me that might happen.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.911
I'm gonna read the rest myself.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.247
"The eclipse isn't visible
from everywhere.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.208
There's a double shadow zone,

02:04.208 --> 02:07.961
which happens to run
through our very own Beingsburg.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.795
If you zoom in, the best, best place

02:09.795 --> 02:12.633
in the city to see
the Double Shadow Day eclipse

02:12.633 --> 02:15.761
is the cliffside restaurant, Careful Now."

02:16.345 --> 02:17.721
Hey. That's us.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.266
We just held our limbshake there.
It was a blast.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.393
Gotta skip the rest
'cause there's another group coming in.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.063
Wow, we're busy today. Dismissed.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.275
Do you have time
to see a few more exhibits?

02:33.612 --> 02:34.613
Absolutely.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.084
This has been really fun.

02:50.295 --> 02:54.341
I was just thinking about times
your face has been close to mine.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.635
You catalog these moments?

03:08.897 --> 03:09.940
Yes.

03:11.483 --> 03:14.403
I would mouth push you, if you--

03:18.240 --> 03:19.908
Hey, secure a chamber.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.205
I should probably
head into the restaurant.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.416
The structural engineer is doing
one last inspection

03:27.416 --> 03:29.501
to make sure it doesn't fall off
the cliff today.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.461
But I'll see you there a little later.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.889
This is terrifying.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.683
It is. But knowing we could perish
is part of the allure.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.186
Well, you've lost your foot tubes.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.733
I did it!

03:52.733 --> 03:53.942
Did what?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.778
I have wanted to find a safer way
into the crevasse for revolutions.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.073
It is magnificent. Come look at this.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.325
I can see it from here.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.996
It's just a step down.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.420
I don't think any being has been
down there before. It's spectacular.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.423
I will admit, this is very impressive.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.548
Were you scared?

04:19.468 --> 04:20.469
A little.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.681
And do we feel confident
that your latest structural reinforcements

04:24.681 --> 04:26.725
to the restaurant
will support our larger crowd

04:26.725 --> 04:28.977
and keep us from falling
into the crevasse tonight?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.813
Yes. I confirmed that Careful Now
can hold more beings than ever

04:31.813 --> 04:34.191
- from the plateau we found.
- A plateau!

04:34.191 --> 04:37.319
That sounds like the perfect place
to set up my fireworks

04:37.319 --> 04:40.239
- for tonight's festivities.
- What do you mean?

04:40.239 --> 04:43.617
I am putting together a light display
for beings to enjoy

04:43.617 --> 04:46.495
while they enjoy tonight's display
of no light.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.830
- I wouldn't do that.
- For several reasons.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.748
Why not?

04:49.748 --> 04:54.127
There's no better way to celebrate
an event than by littering the air.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.630
I would leave it alone down there.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.049
See ya later.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.010
And stop by my house
at your earliest convenience.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.179
You got a piece of mail
that looks intriguing.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.890
I didn't open it
so as not to invade your privacy.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.934
But I did read who it's from.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.650
The Cocoslab Island
Hospitality Learnstitution.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.737
Only the most prestigious
hospitality education on the whole orb.

05:20.737 --> 05:25.284
Oh, yes. I applied to their program,
but I doubt I've been accepted. I just--

05:25.284 --> 05:27.536
Open the letter! Read it to me!

05:29.788 --> 05:30.998
To me.

05:30.998 --> 05:35.252
"We are pleased to inform you
that you've been accepted"-- Oh, my Lorb!

05:35.252 --> 05:37.713
You're in. This is significant.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.052
This is what I've always wanted.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.137
And?

05:45.137 --> 05:48.182
And I can't believe I actually got in.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.099
But?

05:49.099 --> 05:53.979
But I just went on my first date
in a very long time with...

05:53.979 --> 05:57.941
Table 16.
The signals have always been strong.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.612
Two positive developments,
and I want both of them.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.155
Your answer will come.

06:03.155 --> 06:07.451
My advice? Go explore the orb
and have new experiences.

06:07.451 --> 06:11.288
This life will always be waiting for you,
should you decide to return.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.498
Or maybe it won't. Who knows?

06:14.082 --> 06:17.377
Well, I'm off to set up my illuminations.
Bye-bye.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.889
This feels incredibly dangerous.

06:28.889 --> 06:33.352
All we have to do is place the fireworks
in line along the edge.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.812
They will all be connected
to this remote control.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.608
And when the time is right,
I hit that button and...

06:41.568 --> 06:45.280
Uh-oh. A firework must have
already been connected.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.823
Well, I'm sure it's fine.

06:52.371 --> 06:53.372
Uh-oh again.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.208
Now I understand the warnings.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.129
- Hi. I got your text.
- Hi.

07:01.630 --> 07:06.760
So, you know how I mentioned applying
to the learnstitution on Cocoslab Island?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.845
Of course.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.472
Well, I got in.

07:10.472 --> 07:14.101
- You got in. Congratulations!
- Gratitude.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.355
That's really great.
When would you have to leave?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.606
I haven't accepted yet.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.691
I see.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.777
If I am speaking from the blood pump,

07:23.777 --> 07:27.197
it will make me sad if you leave.
But I'll understand.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.491
I really enjoy our time together.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.661
Me too. I'm conflicted.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.496
That's not good.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.206
I thought you said you'd understand.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.291
Turn around.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.793
Is something on fire?

07:45.048 --> 07:47.092
I'm sure no one will even notice.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.636
- This is very worrisome.
- You're always worried.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.555
- What is going on?
- You're always confused.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.975
This ominous fog spewing from the crevasse
is coming towards Careful Now.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.144
If it blocks out the sky,
the event will be ruined.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.145
Such a downer.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.521
- Oh, Lorb.
- No Lorb?

07:59.521 --> 08:01.398
- And no Rorb?
- Okay!

08:01.398 --> 08:02.482
It was me.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.320
One of the fireworks exploded prematurely
and created a hole in the crevasse

08:06.320 --> 08:09.740
that is continuously releasing
all this fog.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.617
There's no time to tell you I told you so.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.327
I'll do it. I told you so.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.413
You told me. But they're fireworks.
Come on.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.415
We need to plug the source of the leak

08:18.415 --> 08:20.542
and stop the fog
from blocking Rorb and Lorb.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.170
This is a once-in-every-
fifteen-revolutions occurrence.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.923
Careful Now cannot go down in history
disappointing hundreds of beings

08:25.923 --> 08:27.799
during Beingsburg's biggest celebration.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.719
Haven't they been disappointed enough
by our sustenance?

08:30.719 --> 08:31.845
Let's make a plan.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.097
- Phase one.
- We need to seal the hole in the crevasse.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.851
Any ideas of a substance
that could fill such an odd location?

08:37.851 --> 08:39.477
What about gelatinous predators?

08:40.062 --> 08:41.688
I love that. Brilliant!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.815
Is that a real suggestion?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.817
That was the first thing
that came to mind.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.861
- Bad idea. Not helpful.
- We're running out of time.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.030
- What are they talking about?
- Just weird.

08:50.030 --> 08:54.076
No. What if we use Careful Now's
scalding hot plaster-like jitter liquid

08:54.076 --> 08:55.786
to melt down the gelatinous predators

08:55.786 --> 08:57.913
and create
a disgusting hodgepodge sealant?

08:58.580 --> 08:59.873
Any better ideas?

09:01.708 --> 09:06.046
It's not a good idea,
but it is our only idea. Let's try it?

09:08.841 --> 09:09.925
I'll brew a fresh pot.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.386
Phase two. I'll create a diversion

09:12.386 --> 09:15.013
to prevent our guests
from possible disappointment.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.306
Okay. That leaves--

09:16.306 --> 09:18.976
- Phase three!
- Taking the disgusting hodgepodge,

09:18.976 --> 09:21.395
hanging off the cliff
and pouring it into the hole.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.729
You know we can do it.

09:23.397 --> 09:26.066
Well, that settles it.
I'll get the steppy-speakies.

09:26.066 --> 09:30.028
It's nice to see everyone coming together
to solve a problem we all created.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.656
<i>Phase one, you're a go.</i>

09:32.656 --> 09:35.993
I just-- I can't be the reason
they don't go to learnstitution,

09:35.993 --> 09:39.371
but I want them to stay.
I've never liked a being this much before.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.706
Well, they clearly like you too.

09:40.706 --> 09:41.790
It's very sweet

09:41.790 --> 09:44.418
and also sometimes annoying
for the rest of the staff.

09:44.418 --> 09:47.171
I have no experience
with faraway relationships.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.630
Are they even possible?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.549
Will they meet a new being
at learnstitution

09:50.549 --> 09:52.759
who does not sneeze
around their vibrating creature

09:52.759 --> 09:54.344
and forget about me?

09:54.344 --> 09:56.263
Being far away
makes the blood pump expand.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.807
I lived far away from my sibling
and missed them so much.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.350
Then I moved here to be close to them,

10:00.350 --> 10:02.603
and now I get annoyed
by how loudly they slurp soup.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.980
I think I lost track of the conversation.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.107
I'm just saying,
this could be a good thing.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.317
For a little while.

10:08.317 --> 10:11.695
I know. You are right.
Love is a complicated beast, isn't it?

10:11.695 --> 10:12.779
I have no idea.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.240
Okay, jitter liquid is all done.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.368
Here, take this down to the cliff.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.330
Check out that pink cloud.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.041
Let's watch it
and see how much higher it's gonna get.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.043
The patrons are starting
to notice the fog.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.878
Phase two. Activate.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.923
Gratitude for nothing.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.800
I'm not putting up with this anymore.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.802
Quick. Let's capture that drama.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.805
Hey, everybody,
double shadow drama happening here.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.350
We can't argue in front of the patrons.

10:41.350 --> 10:45.062
- It's unappetizing.
- Well, where should we argue then?

10:45.646 --> 10:46.647
The kitchen.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.690
Are they all observing us?

10:48.690 --> 10:49.942
Yes, I think so.

10:49.942 --> 10:52.444
How are you feeling about your dilemma?

10:52.444 --> 10:56.907
Not great. I'm leaning
towards going to learnstitution,

10:56.907 --> 11:00.536
and I'm dreading telling
my new romantic friend.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.329
The moons really do
cause erratic behavior.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.622
This argument makes no sense.

11:03.622 --> 11:07.501
That's life.
Sometimes you have to do hard things.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.044
I know.

11:09.044 --> 11:12.256
Distractions are clearly
not our strong suit, but it's working.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.133
- How's it looking out there?
- That bought us some time.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.888
Lorb, that fog is relentless.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.682
Let's do this.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.934
Time for phase three.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.435
So.

11:27.354 --> 11:31.316
Gelatinous predators, huh? You were right.
I still have some stuck in my mouthstones.

11:31.316 --> 11:35.195
Yeah. This morning was really fun.
I like you.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.655
I like you too.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.700
Are you any closer to making a decision?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.994
Stop flirting and start mixing.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.246
Wanna create a gross concoction with me?

11:44.246 --> 11:45.747
I do.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.264
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

12:05.309 --> 12:09.897
This is disgusting, and it's perfect.
You two make a great team.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.401
- The fog's ruining our experience.
- How are we gonna see the double shadow?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.694
We're losing 'em.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.655
Whatever you all are gonna do,
you better do it fast.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.499
- That should do it.
- It's working.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.626
We did it.

12:30.626 --> 12:31.752
- Yes!
- All right.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.588
- It's still coming.
- Oh, no.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.466
It was a valiant effort,
but the sealant hardened.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.718
And with the increased pressure,
fog is shooting around it.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.137
And directly up here in front of our view.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.765
- What a bummer.
- Let's get out of here.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.518
They're starting to leave.
We need to cork up those gaps.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.936
Anyone have any ideas?

12:50.812 --> 12:52.439
Maybe-- If we--

12:56.276 --> 12:57.945
I've got an absurd idea.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.239
Meet me in the crevasse
with the backup generator.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.452
Here at Careful Now,
there's a startling development.

13:05.452 --> 13:09.081
A pink fog has completely obscured
our view of the eclipse.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.962
But on a positive note,
I'm here with the orb-famous rockers,

13:14.962 --> 13:17.589
The Infinite Sensations. Can I get a word?

13:17.589 --> 13:21.093
A friend here called us
to say there's a chill fog,

13:21.093 --> 13:25.055
and we came to take a rad photo
of our band for our next album cover.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.934
Hopefully the fog doesn't interfere
with Double Shadow Day.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.894
Is that today?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.401
Press every button.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.695
Press every button.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.322
All the buttons.

13:43.282 --> 13:45.284
Uh-oh. Look out!

13:49.204 --> 13:50.205
Okay.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.290
Watch it!

13:57.296 --> 13:58.463
Higher up.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.259
- I got you. There we go. Higher?
- Come on. Higher.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.303
- Uh-huh. More verticality?
- Come on. Aim higher.

14:04.303 --> 14:05.971
- Flip floppers, do your thing!
- More.

14:05.971 --> 14:09.725
- How's it going?
- Need to be more up.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.480
- Push higher.
- Yeah.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.774
I should've bought the newer model.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.484
Here we go!

14:20.194 --> 14:21.278
Yeah. Flop away.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.238
They're getting in there. I see it.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.366
You need to wash these foot tubes.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.580
Slipping. I can't hold it.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.084
- The flip floppers.
- Did we get it?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.628
- Did it work?
- I don't know.

14:42.007 --> 14:47.095
Disappointment hangs in the air,
as does this mysterious pink fog.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.057
With the clock ticking down,
what is your reaction?

14:50.057 --> 14:54.269
Well, I went ahead and stained my skin
with an image of us under the eclipse,

14:54.269 --> 14:56.980
so I really hope we see it.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.233
Did you think that was a bit premature?

14:59.233 --> 15:00.901
Look. Everyone, come back!

15:00.901 --> 15:04.279
Breaking.
It appears the fog is finally lifting.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.451
We did it!

15:10.536 --> 15:13.247
- Great work, pal.
- Couldn't have done it without you.

15:14.623 --> 15:15.916
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.669
We make a great team.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.298
I'm glad we didn't ruin Double Shadow Day
for everybody.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.508
We?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.010
Beings are delighted.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.931
There are cheers and hollers
from this very large and patient crowd.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.434
Double Shadow Day.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.065
I'll let you two talk while I go over here
and pretend not to listen.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.986
So, have you made a decision?

15:43.986 --> 15:45.070
Yes.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.905
I'm going.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.784
Apologies. It's always been my dream.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.120
Does this mean there's no hope
for our relationship?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.290
Of course there's hope.
It's just bad timing.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.293
If there was a way to do both,
I would do it.

15:59.293 --> 16:03.589
Well, my whole life
I've traveled all over.

16:03.589 --> 16:04.882
I could always come visit?

16:04.882 --> 16:08.427
They do have direct flights
to Cocoslab Island every day.

16:08.427 --> 16:10.512
And I've always wanted to go there.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.519
Wow.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.230
You still have gelatinous predators stuck
in there.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.274
- There you two are.
- Greets.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.358
Greets.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.280
We were just talking
about my big decision.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.323
And?

16:29.323 --> 16:31.158
I think it is meeting somewhere
in the middle.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.910
I really like them.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.870
- I think they can hear you.
- Thank you.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.664
You gonna be okay without me?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.082
I think so.

16:39.082 --> 16:42.002
Someone just got a vocational upgrade.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.087
You're looking
at the new manager in training.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.882
Your job will always be here
if you want it.

16:47.591 --> 16:48.884
So we'd both be managers.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.636
Sure, no idea.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.223
To my brilliant,

16:54.223 --> 16:55.641
unflappable,

16:55.641 --> 16:56.683
charming,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.435
unpredictable friends.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.981
Hi. We were asked to play a song
as the eclipse happens,

17:02.981 --> 17:04.398
because we are famous.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.403
<i>Our lives go around
In orbiting spheres</i>

17:08.403 --> 17:12.074
<i>Whether moving closer or further away</i>

17:12.074 --> 17:15.577
<i>Until the next great phase
Of our existence appears</i>

17:15.577 --> 17:19.330
<i>Like the moons up high
On this shadowy day</i>

17:19.330 --> 17:21.208
<i>And just like shadows</i>

17:21.208 --> 17:22.917
<i>We're changing nonstop</i>

17:23.627 --> 17:26.046
- <i>Never too far behind</i>
- <i>Never too far behind</i>

17:26.046 --> 17:30.175
<i>Connected to each other
Like a powerful glomrock</i>

17:30.801 --> 17:33.470
- <i>In the highlights of our mind</i>
- <i>Always on our mind</i>

17:33.470 --> 17:36.682
- <i>It's love that keeps us close</i>
- <i>It's love</i>

17:36.682 --> 17:38.475
- <i>It's love</i>
- <i>It's love</i>

17:38.475 --> 17:41.436
<i>And this connection floats on love</i>

17:41.436 --> 17:43.647
- <i>It's love</i>
- <i>Falls over us</i>

17:43.647 --> 17:47.401
- <i>Like starshine from above</i>
- <i>Like starshine from above</i>

17:47.401 --> 17:49.319
- <i>It's care</i>
- <i>We care</i>

17:49.319 --> 17:52.072
<i>That will bond us everywhere</i>

17:52.072 --> 17:55.534
- <i>We care</i>
- <i>Ease the heart like a comfort square</i>

17:56.285 --> 17:59.788
<i>Our special link that is always there</i>

17:59.788 --> 18:06.545
- <i>We will always share our love</i>
- <i>Always connected through our love</i>

18:07.337 --> 18:14.219
- <i>We will always share our love</i>
- <i>Always connected through our love</i>

18:14.219 --> 18:17.306
<i>We will always share our love</i>

18:40.204 --> 18:42.122
So, I'll see you in a few weeks.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.249
They've gotten used to you.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.709
I'm going to miss them.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.878
But not the way they make
my eyeholes sting.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.671
I'm gonna miss you more though.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.048
I'm gonna miss you too.

18:52.216 --> 18:53.926
Gratitude for all your support.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.930
There's a really unique soil I would love
for you to sample there.

18:57.930 --> 19:00.307
I'll sprinkle some dirt on a postcard.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.727
Hey, thanks for taking me under your wing.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.896
It was one of my best decisions.

19:05.896 --> 19:09.066
And hiring you was one of mine.
Along with this.

19:10.067 --> 19:13.237
- That's permanent.
- That's interesting placement.

19:16.782 --> 19:17.950
That's my cue.

19:28.961 --> 19:32.881
Last call for all beings boarding
flight 334 to Cocoslab Island.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.647
Salutations.

19:48.647 --> 19:51.358
- Greets.
- Looks like we will be cohabitating here.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.652
Looks like it. It's nice to meet you.

19:53.652 --> 19:55.279
It is nice to meet you as well.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.614
The outer void scares me.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.617
An endless dark expanse
totally unexplored, and here we are,

20:00.617 --> 20:03.287
just tiny specks doing our best
to make sense of it all.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.830
Do you think any of this matters?

20:04.830 --> 20:08.417
Of course. The purpose
of life is to give life purpose.

20:08.417 --> 20:11.628
We're given this beautiful opportunity
to connect with each other.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.922
Like my connection with your manager.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.716
What do you think they're doing right now?

20:15.716 --> 20:18.510
They're eating flip floppers
out of the crack in the crevasse?

20:18.510 --> 20:20.387
That's oddly specific and impossible.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.556
No. Sorry. Look.
