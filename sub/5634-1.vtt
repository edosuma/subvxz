00:01.502 --> 00:04.796
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:08.175
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.803
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.887 --> 00:14.806
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:18.101
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.185 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.733
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.816 --> 00:29.863
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:36.245 --> 00:41.834
Ugh. Look at Miss Tammy. What a skank.
She's free muffin it at a baby school.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.294
Hi, Stewie. Mommy's here to pick you up.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.214
Why do you feel the need
to narrate every little thing you do?

00:47.297 --> 00:48.799
Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.468
You know, I've actually been meaning
to talk to you about Stewie.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.388
I'm concerned
that he might have an attention problem.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.973
"Attention problem"?

00:56.056 --> 00:58.308
Yes, he's been
a little difficult to deal with.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.436
And on page two of three
in the <i>How to Be a Teacher</i> manual,

01:01.520 --> 01:04.940
it says that any child who's
being difficult should be medicated.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.942
What? Drugging a baby?

01:07.025 --> 01:09.695
Are you sure? That sounds so serious.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.239
I'm afraid his behavior
has been an issue for a while.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.867
He's even been bothering students
during nap time.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.618
Hey. You up?

01:17.828 --> 01:20.080
Guess where I have a crayon.

01:24.626 --> 01:28.088
So, I spent like $75 on cat toys,
and what does she play with?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.132
- A shoelace.
- That's crazy.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.467
Joe, that's been your answer
every time I tell a story.

01:32.551 --> 01:33.677
It's like you're not even listening.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.929
Well, that's 'cause you interrupted me
when I was telling you

01:36.013 --> 01:39.224
about Kevin trying to hang himself
with an extension cord.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.934
I know, that's crazy.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.645
Hey. Y'all wanna try some of our new food?

01:43.729 --> 01:46.440
I'm trying to turn this place
into a gastropub.

01:46.523 --> 01:50.152
These are Korean tacos,
'cause whatever the hell nowadays.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.280
Ugh, these are terrible.

01:54.448 --> 01:58.535
Quagmire, when it comes to tacos,
I'll trust the Koreans, thank you.

01:58.619 --> 02:02.206
You're nuts. This tastes like
Ani DiFranco after a bike ride.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.209
Jeez, Quagmire,
since when are you such an expert on food?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.586
For your information,
I'm an excellent cook.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.171
You? A cook?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.341
Ha. What's your specialty? No-way-soufflé?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.718
I'm sorry, that was out of line.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.803
I am a good cook.
And I'll prove it to you.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.973
Saturday night, you and all your wives
are coming to my place for dinner.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.099
Fine, we'll be there.

02:21.183 --> 02:22.476
Ooh, can we make it Sunday?

02:22.559 --> 02:25.229
Saturday, I'm giving
Javier Bardem a haircut.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.313
So what'll it be?

02:26.396 --> 02:27.981
- Everything.
- What do you mean?

02:28.065 --> 02:31.318
Long in the short places,
short in the long places.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.404
It should be from both,
the future and the past.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.032
Something a child would do to a doll.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.415
Sorry, I just prefer to do
number two at home. Where were we?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.794
It's Stewie, Dr. Hartman.
He's having trouble focusing at school.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.130
Ah, yes. So you're telling me
your baby won't sit still in a way

02:52.214 --> 02:54.424
- that's convenient for his teacher?
- Yes.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.678
I'd heard stories, but never thought
I'd see it with my own eyes.

02:57.761 --> 03:01.682
Mrs. Griffin, I'm going to write Stewie
a prescription for ADHD medication.

03:01.765 --> 03:05.727
Really? Well, I don't know.
Doesn't that stuff make you wired?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.063
Well, if you're low-energy
and lethargic, yes.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.233
But if you're high-energy, it actually
calms you down and helps you focus.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.360
At least that's what I'm reading on WebMD.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.196
Wow, there are a lot
of different kinds of medicines.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.823
There's a cat in here.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.117
Okay, I guess we could give it a try.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.285
Here you go.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.995
Now, who's this little guy?

03:29.001 --> 03:31.170
Wow, when did you learn to cook, Glenn?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.379
Well, as a young man,

03:32.462 --> 03:35.591
I found that a great meal
was the quickest way to a woman's heart.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.092
How romantic.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.595
I mean, how do you think NBA players
get all those chicks?

03:39.678 --> 03:41.805
They're all great cooks.
Except Kobe Bryant.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.599
His secret is different.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.894
Quagmire, you're really good.
You could probably make money at this.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.062
Yeah, maybe you could open a restaurant.

03:49.146 --> 03:50.939
Or maybe get a cooking show.

03:51.023 --> 03:54.443
You know, the 11:30 cooking show
on Channel 5 needs a new host.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.905
The old one burned off his eyebrows
and was just too weird to look at.

03:57.988 --> 04:01.325
You should do it, Quagmire.
I'll even come along and cheer you on.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.202
- You'd do that for me?
-'Course I would.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.121
I love cheering people on.
Like when I go to NASCAR.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.873
Go in a circle!

04:07.956 --> 04:09.458
Go in a circle!

04:09.541 --> 04:11.251
- Go in a circle!

04:11.335 --> 04:12.961
Advertise stuff!

04:13.045 --> 04:15.297
Advertise... Go in a circle!

04:21.303 --> 04:22.387
Hey, where's Stewie?

04:22.471 --> 04:25.224
- Oh, he's probably sleeping off his pills.
- What?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.434
Well, the school said
he had an attention problem,

04:27.518 --> 04:29.686
so Dr. Hartman gave him a prescription.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.940
You're giving a one-year-old drugs?
You're doping up a baby.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.567
- Peter, are you okay with this?
- Will you stop talking?

04:35.651 --> 04:38.529
I'm trying to think about a girl
I saw at the gas station.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.907
Stewie?

04:43.575 --> 04:46.787
Welcome to pillow world, Bri.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.789
Let me get up and greet you.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.252
There we go. How you doing?

04:53.335 --> 04:55.671
Oh, my God, Stewie,
you're totally drugged out.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.340
You know something? I've been thinking

04:58.423 --> 05:02.886
about how everyone in this family, Brian,
does their job.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.222
And they do a pretty good job of it.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.772
God, I'm really freaking out
over this audition.

05:13.856 --> 05:14.940
What if I blow it?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.692
Quagmire, when I agreed to come to this,

05:16.775 --> 05:19.695
I didn't know it would require
this level of emotional support.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.823
You Glenn Quagmire?
I'm Carson, the producer of the show.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.324
Peter Griffin, I should be at work.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.826
Okay, let's see what you've got.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.119
I think you're gonna like this.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.454
Cedar plank salmon with a maple glaze

05:29.538 --> 05:32.833
and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes
on a bed of mesclun greens.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.211
Mmm, not bad.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.923
Also, the tomatoes can be eyes,
and the lettuce can be hair.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.050
Look down, there's also a carrot.

05:42.134 --> 05:46.346
This is great.
Terrific food and a hilarious sidekick.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.849
- This! This is the show.
- What do you mean?

05:48.932 --> 05:52.102
I'm saying you're hired
just as long as your friend joins you.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.022
- What do you say, Peter?
- I say let's do it!

05:55.689 --> 05:57.900
- Whoops. Uh...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.861
What do I... What do I do?

06:05.449 --> 06:07.826
I don't... I don't know what to do now.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.372
That was the wrong choice, Peter.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.466
Wow, Quagmire, look at you.
You're a real TV chef.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.259
I know. It might sound silly,

06:24.343 --> 06:26.887
but being a chef is something
I've always dreamed about.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.515
I always dream about my house
filling up with water.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.599
That's crazy.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.726
But anyway,
thanks for encouraging me, Peter.

06:32.809 --> 06:37.397
All right, places.
We're rolling in three, two, one.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.441
Welcome back to <i>Quagmire's Kitchen.</i>

06:39.525 --> 06:42.736
Now, this mince pie's about ready to go.
Just needs a pinch of cinnamon.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.862
And while we're at it,

06:43.946 --> 06:45.822
how about we take
the cinnamon challenge?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.575
Okay, Peter, we've all seen
the Internet videos, we're not doing that.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.077
I was talking about something else.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.329
I was talking about
a serious cooking thing.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.166
Now, the ingredients of a mince pie
are traceable to the 13th century,

06:56.250 --> 06:59.503
when returning European crusaders
brought back Middle Eastern recipes

06:59.586 --> 07:03.298
containing meats, fruits
and, oh, boy, spices.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.716
Right here, I'm using cloves.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.637
Of course, most people associate
a mince pie with Christmas.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.890
But I'll be honest.
I'm not afraid of a summer mince pie.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.892
I remember the first time I had mince pie.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.562
Our neighbor, Mrs. Moran,
introduced it to me one afternoon.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.397
- God!
- I had house-sat for her while she was

07:18.480 --> 07:19.940
- visiting her aunt in Vernon.
- Oh, God.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.149
And she wanted to thank me.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.694
And, oh, boy, what a treat it was.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.195
- You done?
- Yeah.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.448
All right,
best two out of three, cinnamon.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.667
Still on those meds, huh?

07:38.834 --> 07:42.004
Uh, yeah, they, uh...
they help me to, um...

07:43.172 --> 07:44.715
uh, think.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.468
Okay, time for an eyes-open nap.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.598
God, look what those pills
are doing to you.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.725
Putting you on that stuff
was a huge mistake.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.144
Like inviting a turtle
to a cocktail party.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.898
Hey. Ask me why they call me a box turtle.

08:03.192 --> 08:07.446
See, this is how American society
treats unique, enthusiastic children.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.448
Instead of embracing their mental gifts,

08:09.531 --> 08:12.242
their first reaction is to shoot them up
with hardcore drugs

08:12.326 --> 08:13.869
until they're mindless sheeple.

08:13.952 --> 08:18.165
All the better to send off to Kuwait and
feed the Halliburton oil machine, right?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.625
Bush.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.753
Yup, takes all kinds.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.714
You know, a lot of kids in my school
take ADD pills.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.841
They say if you're lazy and unmotivated,

08:27.925 --> 08:30.219
it makes you super energized
and productive.

08:30.302 --> 08:33.138
Re... Really? Productive?

08:33.222 --> 08:36.808
Yeah. And college kids take it all the
time so they can focus on their studies

08:36.892 --> 08:38.810
and drinking alcohol with their butts.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.481
Focus, huh?

08:42.898 --> 08:46.652
Okay, well, Stewie, these babies
can help the garbage disposal focus.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.779
Because that's where they're going.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.949
No need to follow me
because I just said what I was gonna do.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.124
My God, I can't stop.
The words are just pouring out of me.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.752
I have more energy
than a guy who caught a T-shirt.

09:06.839 --> 09:10.509
My wife can wear this to sleep!
My wife can wear this to sleep!

09:15.764 --> 09:18.475
Okay. Today, we're putting together
duck breast medallions

09:18.559 --> 09:19.935
with a port wine reduction.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.520
And as I'm walking you through the steps,

09:21.603 --> 09:24.690
watch your screen
for Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.026
Helpful hints and food factoids
to make your meal a success.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.363
Now, you're gonna want to start
with a large self-sealing plastic bag.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.701
And in that bag, we'll combine one large,
finely chopped garlic clove,

09:35.784 --> 09:38.495
one tablespoon of grated,
peeled, fresh ginger,

09:38.579 --> 09:41.790
two teaspoons of five-spice powder,
a teaspoon of salt,

09:41.874 --> 09:44.168
and a half teaspoon
of fresh ground pepper.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.129
Then you're gonna wanna add
the duck breasts, seal the bag,

09:47.212 --> 09:49.298
and refrigerate that
for at least one hour,

09:49.381 --> 09:52.134
or up to 24 hours
if you wanna prepare this ahead of time.

09:52.217 --> 09:56.221
Just make sure you remove the bag from
the refrigerator one hour before cooking.

09:56.305 --> 09:59.391
You're gonna put that in your oven,
preheat it to 400 degrees.

10:01.727 --> 10:05.147
So we just spoon on the drippings,
and that'll brown the skin nicely.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.609
If you bang these metal spoons
on everything, it's like STOMP.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.405
- Look at me! I'm huge in 2002!
- Peter.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.408
Nothing like a night at the theater
that ends in a headache!

10:16.491 --> 10:17.701
Damn it, Peter, that's it!

10:17.784 --> 10:20.245
I can't do this show with you anymore!
You're fired!

10:20.329 --> 10:23.665
What? You can't fire me!
Only Mr. Spacely can fire me.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.752
Griffin, you're fired!

10:26.835 --> 10:28.629
Okay, that's fair.

10:34.343 --> 10:35.636
Peter, can I come in?

10:35.719 --> 10:38.722
Hold on, let me put on
my weird old actress turban.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.475
Yes?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.143
Listen, I saw what happened,

10:43.227 --> 10:46.146
but you should know,
we at the station would hate to lose you.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.773
You're a big hit with the viewers.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.192
I will not work with that man again.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.568
I'm not asking you to.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.738
In fact, we'd like to offer you
your own cooking show.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.199
Hmm, let me consult with my lawyer.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.952
Well, Peter, since the DUIs happened
so close together,

11:00.035 --> 11:01.954
we don't really have
much wiggle room here.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.915
I suggest you take the jail time
and just get it over with.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.626
I'll do it. After October 13th.

11:15.717 --> 11:20.597
Come on, Rupert. Wait till you see this.
This is really something special.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.434
Check out how much water
is in the dehumidifier.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.437
Wow!

11:27.521 --> 11:29.982
That was all in the air.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.154
Brian? Is that, uh...

11:36.238 --> 11:38.198
Is that, uh, you?

11:38.282 --> 11:39.575
Stewie! Rearrange.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.995
Ewiets. Rearrange.
Wieest. Restore. Stewie.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.746
Hey, come see what I've been working on.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.126
I call it Space Shire Seven.

11:49.626 --> 11:54.089
Nice, nice. It's like, uh...
It's like a fake place you made?

11:54.173 --> 11:57.467
It's a medieval sci-fi universe,
adaptable to TV, movies,

11:57.551 --> 11:59.052
toys, games, and mobile apps!

11:59.136 --> 12:01.346
I threw together
a 2,000-page treatment last night.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.807
And I just figured, the hell with it,
why not build a scale model

12:03.891 --> 12:05.309
and record voices for all the characters?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.393
- Watch.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.978
<i>Well met, stranger.</i>

12:10.105 --> 12:13.442
That's a Nebulon Mage. He speaks Gabi,
this dumb language I wrote.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.737
- It's then illegal?
- What?

12:18.155 --> 12:19.364
Hello?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.830
Okay, now we add the diced tomatoes.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.374
- Just gonna keep going here.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.169
I like to drizzle these
with a fig balsamic...

12:32.252 --> 12:34.129
Damn it.
What the hell is going on over there?

12:38.884 --> 12:42.804
And that's my famous paella that looks
and tastes just like a pizza bagel.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.056
It's a pizza bagel.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.892
Now, as always, add butter to taste.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.561
Mmm, delicious!

12:49.645 --> 12:50.771
Butter dunk!

12:55.234 --> 12:57.986
Stop it! Stop the show!
What the hell are you doing?

12:58.070 --> 13:00.614
You're just pouring melted butter
onto frozen foods.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.574
- You're not a chef.
- Oh, really?

13:02.658 --> 13:06.995
Then why do I already have a restaurant
in Orlando's largest indoor water park?

13:07.079 --> 13:09.790
This is an insult
to anyone who cares about cooking.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.708
Either you leave the network or I do!

13:11.792 --> 13:13.710
Guys, guys, look,
I know how we can settle this.

13:13.794 --> 13:14.878
A cook-off.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.590
Each of you cooks a meal using
a secret ingredient, <i>Iron Chef</i> style.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.592
Will we be allowed to use calculators?

13:20.676 --> 13:22.761
Um, I don't... What?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.346
I say bring it on!

13:24.429 --> 13:28.016
Fine! A cook-off it is.
See you in the kitchen, jerk.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.477
I'll see you in hell, loser.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.314
- Bad day to carpool.
- Yeah.

13:39.945 --> 13:43.198
Okay, Joe. Peter and I are going
head-to-head in that cooking competition,

13:43.282 --> 13:44.741
and they're letting us
each use an assistant.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.826
Will you help me out?

13:45.909 --> 13:47.911
Okay, but just promise me
there's no reading.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.997
- I'm not a strong reader.
- What?

13:50.080 --> 13:51.915
I'm not illiterate, I'm just slow.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.041
What are you talking about?

13:53.125 --> 13:56.461
I never tried hard in school
'cause I could always run fast.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.799
So, you're cool with being my chef helper
for the big show?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.634
Sure, but I gotta be honest.

14:02.718 --> 14:05.804
If it ain't a fish with whiskers,
I don't know what to do with it.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.057
- But if it is?
- Then sweet sassy molassey!

14:09.141 --> 14:12.352
Great. Don't talk that way
when we're on the show.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.609
<i>You're taking a chance, risking it all</i>

14:18.692 --> 14:21.236
<i>For the thrill of the moment</i>

14:22.112 --> 14:25.949
<i>Taking a stand, but you ain't gonna fall</i>

14:26.408 --> 14:28.619
<i>And you've always known it</i>

14:29.119 --> 14:31.914
<i>They're dying to shake you</i>

14:32.956 --> 14:35.501
<i>Trying their best to break you</i>

14:35.584 --> 14:40.714
<i>And though the going is rough</i>
<i>You're going home as a hero</i>

14:42.132 --> 14:45.302
<i>'Cause there's thunder in your heart</i>

14:45.802 --> 14:49.097
<i>Every move is like lightning</i>

14:49.473 --> 14:55.604
<i>It's the power you feel</i>
<i>when you get your taste</i><i>of the glory</i>

14:56.647 --> 14:58.565
<i>You can light the dark</i>

14:58.649 --> 15:03.445
<i>When they hear your heart of thunder</i>

15:06.907 --> 15:10.619
Stewie! Stew-ez Canal. You're here.
We gotta get going.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.037
"Going"?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.123
- Where?
- To Hartford, man.

15:15.207 --> 15:16.917
There's a book fair
at the convention center,

15:17.000 --> 15:18.919
and George R.R. Martin will be there.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.088
- Who's that?
- Uh,<i> Game of Thrones,</i>

15:21.171 --> 15:22.422
black shirts, dandruff.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.092
Takes down more nerd chotch
than anyone around?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.176
Okay.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.596
Anyway, I'm gonna show him my models
and pitch him Space Shire Seven.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.433
Okay, before we go, I should wet my eyes.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.942
There.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.533
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker,

15:49.616 --> 15:52.202
and we have a fantastic
cooking competition for you today

15:52.286 --> 15:54.288
with two fantastic chefs.

15:54.371 --> 15:57.457
Really? You couldn't find
another adjective for "fantastic"?

15:57.541 --> 16:00.627
- Used "fantastic" twice? Who wrote this?
- Erica did.

16:00.711 --> 16:02.921
Wait, is that the one I called fat
and we can't fire?

16:03.005 --> 16:05.507
- Yeah.
- Let's get this contest started!

16:08.510 --> 16:10.179
Big whoop. I can do that.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.474
Oh, my God, Erica! You killed Erica!

16:14.558 --> 16:16.101
Fantastic.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.693
That's him. George R.R. Martin.

16:27.613 --> 16:31.283
God, he must be the coolest fat guy
in a train conductor's cap in the world!

16:31.742 --> 16:33.285
Mr. Martin, I'm Brian Griffin,

16:33.368 --> 16:35.829
and I've got a pitch
that's gonna blow you away.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.081
- Are you sitting down?
- Almost always.

16:38.165 --> 16:42.753
Then join me on an interstellar crusade
to Space Shire Seven!

16:43.462 --> 16:48.300
Our story begins 50,000 fortnights ago
in the distant galaxy of Warlock's Keep.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.676
Comet Castle falls.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.262
Samson Cyberblood is the new king
of the star system.

16:52.346 --> 16:56.350
Long live Space Shire Seven,
and long live the Hyperspeed Throne!

16:58.477 --> 17:00.020
So? What do you think?

17:00.103 --> 17:01.271
It was terrible.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.857
Ah, you're speaking the language
of the Opposite Goblins.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.275
I'm very flattered.

17:05.359 --> 17:08.070
No, it's garbage.
You just took a lot of pills,

17:08.153 --> 17:11.073
mashed together a bunch
of sci-fi and fantasy clichés

17:11.156 --> 17:13.700
and crapped out a 2,000-page turd.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.037
- You could tell I was on medication?
- Oh, sure.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.791
But that stuff doesn't make you
write well, it just makes you write a lot.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.125
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:22.209 --> 17:24.795
I have to go wash the nerd chotch
out of my beard.

17:27.673 --> 17:32.219
God. I didn't realize how those drugs
were ruining me creatively.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.097
I haven't been
feeling quite right, either.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.433
Yesterday, I watched Chris shower
for half an hour

17:38.517 --> 17:41.061
just because I thought it was the TV.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.396
He, um...

17:42.479 --> 17:44.398
He lies on his back in there.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.733
Stewie, this drug is ruining us.

17:46.817 --> 17:49.111
- We don't need these.
- You're right.

17:49.194 --> 17:52.114
These pills are for people
with real problems.

17:52.197 --> 17:56.118
But there's nothing wrong with us.
You're just lazy, I'm just excitable.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.162
We're both normal. Now let's go home.

18:02.416 --> 18:07.421
That man is an imposter!
I am George R.R. Martin!

18:07.504 --> 18:09.089
Whoa!

18:16.555 --> 18:18.932
Let's begin the Channel 5 cook-off.

18:19.016 --> 18:21.643
Remember, the winner gets to keep
his TV show.

18:21.727 --> 18:24.271
And the secret ingredient is

18:25.105 --> 18:26.106
butter.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.150
- Ah, sweet!
- No.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.776
That's Peter's specialty.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.491
I was hoping the secret ingredient
would be popcorn shrimps.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.702
I liked smacking your butt earlier.

18:40.037 --> 18:43.790
Are the balls different from the cubes?
God, what do I do?

18:43.874 --> 18:45.542
Joe, check if we have shallots!

18:45.626 --> 18:48.587
Okay. I can't see anything on the counter,
but I'll do my best.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.090
Monster brains!

18:52.174 --> 18:56.720
Looks like Chef Griffin is preparing
a delicious five-course butter feast.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.014
Son of a bitch, I never cook with butter.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.724
Joe, grab my recipe book
and find a dish

19:00.807 --> 19:02.726
where I can substitute
olive oil with butter.

19:04.853 --> 19:05.938
Joe, come on, hurry!

19:06.021 --> 19:08.690
I told you I'm not a strong reader!

19:12.861 --> 19:14.154
Damn it, Joe, pull it together!

19:14.238 --> 19:17.324
Hey, Quagmire. FYI,
I gotta take off in, like, 10 minutes.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.535
- I got a clarinet lesson.
- What?

19:19.618 --> 19:21.703
I can't do this.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.670
Look at Quagmire.
This was his dream.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.589
Time's almost up, Peter. We're gonna win!

19:34.758 --> 19:36.385
No, we're not.

19:40.848 --> 19:44.893
And in a stunning turn of events,
Chef Griffin is eating his entire meal.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.228
He'll have nothing to serve.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.527
Well, that's it.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.280
If Chef Quagmire has prepared
a dish of any kind,

19:56.363 --> 19:57.823
he wins this competition.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.533
Let's see what he has.

19:59.616 --> 20:03.453
A warm packet of tartar sauce
brought in from somewhere else.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.164
"When are you gonna use that?"
Bonnie said.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.166
We have a winner!

20:11.670 --> 20:14.214
Peter, you threw the cook-off for me?

20:14.298 --> 20:16.466
I couldn't take your dream away...
Heart attack!

20:16.550 --> 20:17.676
...from you, buddy.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.720
You're the... Mini stroke!
...one with the real...

20:19.803 --> 20:21.138
Heart attack! ...talent.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.973
You... Heart attack!
...deserve the show...

20:23.056 --> 20:24.600
Regular stroke! ...not me.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.521
You're a good friend, Peter.
But I don't want a show, either.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.773
- You don't?
-'Course not.

20:31.857 --> 20:33.692
I mean, look what the show did to us.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.236
It destroyed
the most important friendship I have.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.321
Thanks.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.531
You know what? Let's end this for good.

20:39.615 --> 20:40.616
How?

20:40.699 --> 20:43.744
The same way Paula Deen
got her cooking show taken off the air.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.747
By saying the one word
you can't come back from.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.250
What? Say the word? Right now?

20:50.334 --> 20:52.002
Yeah. Together.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.631
- Ready?
- You bet.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.511
You could have just quit the show.
