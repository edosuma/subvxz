Okay, okay,
there's no need to panic.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.397
This is just a routine drill.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.649
Just routine.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.318
This is just a drill, right?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.278
Bullhorn op.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.654
Out of the way, Zorski.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.282
{\an8}People, I have
just been informed

01:14.365 --> 01:16.493
{\an8}there is not an actual fire.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.411
{\an8}Thank you, Mr. Zipper.

01:18.495 --> 01:23.208
{\an8}Nevertheless, we will continue
to proceed with the drill.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.710
{\an8}Repeat, proceed with the drill.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.629
Oh, Ginger...

01:27.712 --> 01:30.089
Step back a sec.

01:33.927 --> 01:34.594
I've been meaning
to thank you

01:34.677 --> 01:36.137
for not telling
Mrs. Zorski

01:36.221 --> 01:39.390
{\an5}that I filed
that anonymous
fashion complaint

01:39.474 --> 01:41.476
about her wearing
last year's styles.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.852
Seriously, how can
anyone be expected

01:42.936 --> 01:46.064
to learn under
those circumstances?

01:46.147 --> 01:47.357
I hear you...

01:47.440 --> 01:49.234
{\an1}Oh, I just love fire drills,
don't you, Miranda?

01:49.317 --> 01:53.154
It gives you a good chance
to catch up on the gossip.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.823
Last fire drill
I found out...

01:54.906 --> 01:56.783
{\an1}Are you speaking
to me?

01:56.866 --> 01:58.785
Looks like
Courtney and Ginger

01:58.868 --> 02:00.870
are swapping
the latest scoop.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.539
Know any good scandal?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.290
{\an1}Like I'd tell you
the time.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.458
Oh, no offense taken.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.377
I'm sure Ginger
will fill me in later.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.795
She's my best friend,
after all.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.341
Do you really
think so, Dodie?

02:13.424 --> 02:14.259
Of course I think so.

02:14.342 --> 02:18.388
I've had that position
since pre-kindergarten.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.181
Well, looks
like Courtney

I need two volunteers

to demonstrate the correct usage
of the fire hose.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.359
Any takers?

02:31.442 --> 02:33.027
No? What a surprise.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.947
We'll volunteer,
Principal Milty.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.991
Uh, Courtney,
are you sure

02:38.074 --> 02:38.616
you want to
do this?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.619
{\an1}Of course.
It will be fun.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.455
{\an5}Looks like
best friend
behavior to me.

02:44.539 --> 02:48.960

over their fire drill duties.

I know everything
about Ginger

03:00.179 --> 03:03.766
starting with her love
of smiley-faced pajamas

03:03.850 --> 03:07.020
{\an5}and ending
with her irrational
fear of the tooth fairy.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.271
{\an1}(<i> laughing</i> ):
Right...

03:08.354 --> 03:10.732
{\an1}I think she mentioned those
to Courtney.

03:10.815 --> 03:14.777
{\an5}Well... Courtney
certainly doesn't know
about Frizzy Lizzies

03:14.861 --> 03:17.530
{\an5}Ginger's deepest,

does she?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.073
Well?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
(<i> both laughing...</i> )

03:26.623 --> 03:29.167
Did I hear
"Frizzy Lizzy" just now?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.710
{\an1}But Ginger would never
tell anyone else

03:30.793 --> 03:32.128
{\an1}about her
red-hairy legs

03:32.211 --> 03:35.423
{\an1}that her mom won't
let her shave. (<i> gasps</i> )

exactly how long
it takes

{\an5}to walk
to the teacher's
supply closet

03:46.184 --> 03:47.894
locate a box of chalk
and walk back.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.605
No side trips,

{\an1}Whatever you say,

04:25.932 --> 04:29.310
{\an1}So tell me, when did your
male pattern baldness strike?

04:29.394 --> 04:33.231
{\an1}'Cause yesterday you had
a rather full head of hair, no?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.900
On your way, Foutley.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.528
Fine. But I'm sensing denial,
Mr. L.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.737
I know people.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.115
Call if you need me.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.121
Interesting.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.040
{\an4}(<i> gasps</i> )
Did you hear that?

04:48.204 --> 04:51.040
What?

{\an5}The sound of the world
as you know it coming
to a screeching halt.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.753
What are you talking about?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.338
Oh... (<i> chuckles</i> )

04:57.422 --> 04:58.423
It's a secret.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.590
Yours, in fact.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.343
And if you don't do
exactly as I say

05:02.427 --> 05:04.679
I'll reveal your

Oh, but I do.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.229
And no one else
needs to know

05:13.312 --> 05:17.400
about this embarrassing

stay away from Courtney!

from now on, Foutley.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.836
Aw, I'm disappointed.

would feel more... synthetic.

(<i> sniffs</i> )

05:44.052 --> 05:46.554
{\an1}Hey, Carl, you should

(<i> growling</i> )

06:13.873 --> 06:16.000

No time.

rising.

{\an1}Grarr...

06:23.299 --> 06:25.843
You guys...

06:25.927 --> 06:28.638
Miranda's totally bluffing,
right?

06:28.721 --> 06:29.305
You two are
the only ones

06:29.388 --> 06:31.891
who know about
my Frizzy Lizzies

06:31.974 --> 06:33.226
and you'd never tell.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.395
Only under threat of torture.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.482
{\an1}Oh...!

06:39.565 --> 06:41.651
{\an1}All right, all right,
I can't take it anymore!

06:41.734 --> 06:44.320
I did it!

06:44.403 --> 06:46.322
I told Miranda
how you can't shave

06:46.405 --> 06:47.949
your awful, red-hairy legs!

06:48.032 --> 06:49.700
Oh...!

06:49.784 --> 06:52.495
You traitor.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.664
It was
a total accident.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.041
Miranda said Courtney
was your best friend

06:57.125 --> 06:58.960
{\an1}and she just got me
so flustered

06:59.043 --> 07:00.128
it slipped out.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.797
Dodie... how could you?

07:02.880 --> 07:06.342
I didn't mean to.

I'm so sorry.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.721
Oh...

07:10.805 --> 07:12.557

you didn't mention

smiley-face pajamas

07:14.433 --> 07:16.352
{\an1}or that whole

Oh... oh, yeah.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.197
(<i> bubbling</i> )

07:28.281 --> 07:31.492
{\an1}Do you find that hump
on your little toe irritating?

07:31.576 --> 07:35.538
{\an5}Not as irritating
as receiving visitors
during my foot bath.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.165
Carl, what are you
up to?

07:37.248 --> 07:39.584
Medical research,
perfectly routine.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.298
No ripping
any more pages.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.258
I'm missing
the whole chapter

07:47.341 --> 07:48.467
on leech therapy.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.719
{\an1}Uh-oh.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.220
There's got to be something

07:51.304 --> 07:52.680
on that hairy disease.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.890
Jeez, Mrs. Foutley

07:53.973 --> 07:56.559
{\an1}you could capsize a boat
in that thing.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.227
Thanks for your concern.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.729
Now take your apple.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.399
Success!

08:06.986 --> 08:10.198
Mmm... eucalyptus with
a hint of adhesive corn pad.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.199
Might have to market these.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.786
Uh-uh... one dip
per foot bath.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.005
{\an1}May I present
the Unicorn razor.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.423
My mom swears by these.

08:27.506 --> 08:32.010
{\an5}Uh, why...
is it extra sharp
or something?

08:32.094 --> 08:32.929
Oh, I doubt it.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.597
It's called
"the young woman's choice."

08:35.681 --> 08:39.559
It's her only choice since
you spilt the beans, sister.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.312
{\an1}Ginger, I got you
into this

08:41.395 --> 08:44.607
and I'm going to make you
get yourself out of this.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.067
Macie, shaving cream.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.744
{\an1}JoAnn (<i> knocking</i> ):
Ginger!

08:56.827 --> 08:57.870
(<i> all gasp</i> )

08:57.954 --> 08:59.956
{\an1}Your mother
wants you home!

09:00.039 --> 09:01.791
Oh...
thanks, Mrs. Bishop.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.541
Got to go.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.752
But your reputation's
at stake!

09:04.835 --> 09:06.337
Not to mention
you have foam

09:06.420 --> 09:08.297
seeping through
your pants leg.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.548
I know, I know.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.717
I'll deal with it
later, guys. Bye.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.227
Mother, they're predicting
a cold snap tonight.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.437
Do you think you could pick up
some fresh hay for my den?

09:23.521 --> 09:26.148
Carl, your grandmother
went arthritic

09:26.232 --> 09:27.650
knitting you that afghan.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.859
You're going to use it.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.987
When you grow up,
you can sleep in hay.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.489
Correction:
I go by "Wolf Boy" now.

09:33.572 --> 09:33.906
Thanks in advance.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.992
Sorry, Mr. Boy.

09:36.075 --> 09:36.826
Can you believe
this kid?

09:36.909 --> 09:39.537
One day he's got
a relatively clean face

09:39.620 --> 09:41.372
the next it's
covered with hair.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.415
What? Hair?

09:42.498 --> 09:46.002
Now, as my sister,
we're in the same pack

09:46.085 --> 09:48.379
but I insist on
being the alpha wolf.

09:48.462 --> 09:48.838
(<i> growls</i> )

09:48.921 --> 09:51.674
Oh...

09:55.928 --> 09:57.680
Uh... is Miranda
out there?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.307
Are we
positively certain

09:59.390 --> 10:01.892
that Miranda is waiting
for Ginger?

10:04.270 --> 10:07.440
Steve, you seen
Ginger anywhere?

10:07.523 --> 10:08.566

10:10.318 --> 10:11.319

10:11.402 --> 10:14.947
I'll make a note,
Gregg with three g's.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.866
Seen Ginger with two?

10:23.831 --> 10:26.709
{\an1}I think you should
move to Paris.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.004
It's a known fact that French
women don't shave their legs.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.130
Forget it.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.341
I'm not moving to France.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.300
Huh?

10:34.383 --> 10:35.259
What's going on?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.969
Darren, do me a solid.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.889
Can you tell Miranda
I'm out sick today?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.892
{\an1}Wow... what's Miranda
got on you?

10:42.975 --> 10:46.062
I can't tell you,
but I swear it's big.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.438
Please help me.

10:47.521 --> 10:47.855
{\an1}Done deal.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.528
I can't hide under stairwells
the rest of my life.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.908
Actually, with a generous
ration of canned goods

10:58.991 --> 11:00.117
and a space blanket

11:00.201 --> 11:01.535
you might make it.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.371
Hoodsey:
Step right up!

11:03.454 --> 11:04.955
The legend is true!

11:05.039 --> 11:06.123
Come see--

11:06.207 --> 11:08.459
but don't touch--

11:08.542 --> 11:11.253
the amazing Wolf Boy!

11:11.337 --> 11:13.297
Back! This is a wild animal!

11:13.381 --> 11:16.217
No one must feed, pet

11:16.300 --> 11:18.844
nor aggravate ye Wolf Boy
in any way!

11:18.928 --> 11:20.429
And that means you, Higsby.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.265
{\an1}I just thought he'd like
my veggie burger.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.644
Wolf Boy is a carnivorous beast!

11:26.727 --> 11:28.896
{\an1}It tastes
just like meat.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.815
Even my dad
was fooled.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.944
{\an5}Son, feed him that
and you're as good
as road kill.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.279
Stand back!

11:37.363 --> 11:40.991
Behold... Wolf Boy!

11:41.409 --> 11:44.995
(<i> growling</i> )

11:45.079 --> 11:46.080
(<i> kids scream</i> )

11:46.163 --> 11:48.124
Before your very eyes

11:48.207 --> 11:51.335
is none other than our former
fun-loving friend Carl Foutley.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.796
His freak family gene

11:53.879 --> 11:56.715
has transformed him
into part-boy, part-wolf.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.637
(<i> growling</i> )

12:01.721 --> 12:02.805
(<i> sniffing</i> )

12:06.684 --> 12:07.560
(<i> snarling</i> )

12:07.643 --> 12:09.019
I warned you,
Higsby!

12:09.103 --> 12:10.229
I warned you!

12:10.312 --> 12:11.355
(<i> growling</i> )

12:11.439 --> 12:13.315
{\an1}Mom, can we discuss
my legs?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.359
Sure.
They're cute, shapely...

12:15.443 --> 12:18.237
remind me of my own
as a girl.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.157
I meant shaving my legs.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.325
Oh... well, let me
answer your query

12:23.409 --> 12:25.786
with a story of a girl
much like yourself.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.581
She shaved her legs
behind her mother's back.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.124
One thing
led to another

12:30.207 --> 12:31.459
and she lost
her hearing

12:31.542 --> 12:32.793
at an
amusement park.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.419
And her only horse?

12:33.502 --> 12:36.172
Stolen by rodeo clowns.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.008
{\an1}Uh, I don't even
have a horse.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.259
{\an3}Exactly.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.678
Let's keep it
that way, shall we?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.722
{\an1}I promise
to be careful.

12:44.805 --> 12:45.681
(<i> sniffing</i> )

12:45.764 --> 12:48.142
{\an1}Out!
I'm talking to Mom.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.518
Mom, please.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.352
Ginger,
no on this one.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.314
Shaving your legs
is like...

12:53.397 --> 12:55.357
eating a bag
of pork rinds.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.860
Once you start,
you can't stop.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.528
Ah, the curs-ed Foutley gene.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.864
Has it appeared
on your knuckles yet?

13:01.947 --> 13:02.698
May I call you Wolf Girl?

13:02.781 --> 13:06.160
Don't you have a moon
to howl at?

13:06.243 --> 13:08.913
Mm-hmm... thinking like a wolf.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.372
Bay with me, Sis.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.541
(<i> howling</i> )

13:12.625 --> 13:15.336
I'm not moving to France, Macie.

13:15.419 --> 13:19.381
Well, you better do something,
because here comes Courtney.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.217
Oh...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.677
Hmm, I see you're all
having the special.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.306
{\an1}Ginger, I haven't seen you since
our fire drill tour de force.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.058
What have you been up to?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.476
I've just been...

13:30.559 --> 13:34.146
Ginger, don't you need
to go to the library?

13:34.230 --> 13:36.023
No... I was just there.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.902
{\an1}But what about your report
on <i> Hairy</i> Houdini?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.487
I... got to go, Courtney.

13:41.570 --> 13:44.740
But we haven't talked in ages.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.242
Better shake a leg.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.410
Uh... huh...

13:50.120 --> 13:52.915
Oh, Ginger, your legs will look
absolutely gorgeous

13:52.998 --> 13:57.545
after I pluck all those
pesky red hairs out. Promise.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.255
Can't we wait until
after dinner?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.340
I wouldn't.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.592
There are approximately
58 follicles

14:03.676 --> 14:05.594
per square inch on your leg

14:05.678 --> 14:08.597
so it will take Dodie six days
and three hours

14:08.681 --> 14:10.432
to pluck all 24,604 hairs.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.935
Give or take a hair.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.728
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:17.356 --> 14:19.316
(<i> screams</i> )

14:19.400 --> 14:21.443
Seen my tweezers?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.362
{\an5}Tweezers?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.362
Don't know what
they look like.

14:23.445 --> 14:26.115
I could have sworn
I set them on the coffee table

14:26.198 --> 14:28.993
after I plucked that tick
off Wolf Boy. Hmm.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.619
Tick?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.619
{\an1}Gross.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.787
{\an1}Oh, eww...

14:33.706 --> 14:34.081
{\an5}Hmm.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.378
(<i> rings bell</i> )

14:39.461 --> 14:41.463
Ah, here to see Wolf Boy?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.341
I can offer you
a private viewing.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.634
(<i> kids clamoring</i> )

14:45.718 --> 14:46.760
Children.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.929
Okay, single file
behind me.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.389
No pushing or shoving.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.891
That just brings out
the animal in him.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.101
(<i> kids clamoring</i> )

14:54.184 --> 14:56.770
{\an1}You have
my deepest sympathies.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.855
Is Ginger home?

14:57.938 --> 15:00.316
{\an1}I'm Miranda,
her closest friend.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.859
Really?
Pleased to meet you.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.153
I've heard almost
nothing about you.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.196
{\an1}It's a low-key
friendship.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.323
Ginger! Get down here!

15:07.406 --> 15:11.118
{\an5}She'll be right...
hey, are those
my good tweezers?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.330
Carl...!

15:16.915 --> 15:18.959
Miranda...

15:19.043 --> 15:20.502
What are you
doing here?

15:20.586 --> 15:21.920
{\an1}Cut the chit-chat,
Foutley.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.839
I have a book report due
tomorrow, so get started.

15:23.922 --> 15:27.259
You expect me to write
your book report?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.844
{\an1}And bone up
on your pre-algebra

15:28.927 --> 15:30.679
{\an1}'cause I've got an
assignment for the weekend.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.514
But I've got homework of my own.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.517
Let me pretend I care.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.394
Okay, I'm done.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.688
But Miranda...

15:39.772 --> 15:41.649
{\an1}I'll expect
the report tomorrow

15:41.732 --> 15:43.776

at lunch.

reading this.

(<i> Carl howling</i> )

15:58.123 --> 15:59.667
I'll do what I can.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.125
Thanks, Darren.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.044
I owe you.

and mayo.

as a form of payment.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.975
Mrs. Gordon, he only answers
to Wolf Boy now

16:58.058 --> 17:01.270
due to the unfortunate and until
now recessive Foutley gene

17:01.353 --> 17:02.855
which suddenly make him grow

17:02.938 --> 17:04.064
wolf-like hair.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.273
Zip it, Robert.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.943
{\an1}Carl, do you still have
the power of speech

17:08.026 --> 17:10.028
or has the wolf
got your tongue?

17:10.112 --> 17:11.571
Oh, uh, thanks for asking

17:11.655 --> 17:13.574
but my senses
are keener than ever.

on my twice-baked potato

anymore.

17:29.923 --> 17:33.469
Wolf Boy is a menace
to society. A menace.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.595
(<i> snarling</i> )

what to do with you.

make it original.

with you.

Stealing someone's toupee...

19:52.691 --> 19:54.067
It's more than theft, young man.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.738
You made that poor man
a laughingstock.

19:57.821 --> 19:58.780
Why, why, why?

19:58.864 --> 20:00.365
Mom, don't blame
yourself.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.283
I'm an animal.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.784
Besides, you should
have seen

20:02.868 --> 20:04.328
how fake
that thing looked.

20:04.411 --> 20:04.870
I did old Libby a favor.

20:04.953 --> 20:05.954
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

20:06.038 --> 20:10.375
{\an1}Oh! I'm not finished
with you yet.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.793
Girl:
I love you, Wolf Boy!

20:11.877 --> 20:13.211
{\an1}We heard Mr. Libby caught
him in a snare trap

20:13.295 --> 20:15.964
{\an1}and Wolf Boy had to chew
his own leg off to get out.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.009
Wolf Boy's walking
on two legs again.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.053
Show's over, kids,
he's retired.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.221
(<i> Ginger screams</i> )

20:22.304 --> 20:24.806
(<i> kids scream</i> )

20:24.890 --> 20:26.808
(<i> screaming</i> )

20:26.892 --> 20:29.186
It was just
the test patch.

20:29.269 --> 20:29.978
Lois:
What's going on in there?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.649
It's okay, Mom,
I just saw a spider.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.816
{\an1}Lois:
Oh!

20:34.900 --> 20:36.818
The waxing is off.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.820
{\an1}But you don't want
people to think

20:38.904 --> 20:41.907
{\an1}you have that hairy gene
like your brother, do you?

20:41.990 --> 20:44.284
You actually fell
for that, Macie?

20:44.368 --> 20:46.745
Carl's the master
of manipulation.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.289
He can convince
anyone of anything.

20:49.373 --> 20:49.665
It's a sickness.

20:49.748 --> 20:53.835
Or... a gift.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.629
{\an5}Carl:
You were right to come
to me, ladies.

20:55.712 --> 21:00.467
As you know, I myself recently
had a brush with the hairy life

21:00.550 --> 21:02.511
and understand it's a mixed bag

21:02.594 --> 21:03.679
both at once charmed
and curs-ed.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.764
Can you help me, Carl?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.015
Believe I can, Sis.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.184
Mom has forbidden you
to shave your legs

21:09.267 --> 21:12.104
but said nothing, as I recall,
about your ankles.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.357
{\an1}Show Miranda a hairless ankle
and send her packing.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.900
It might work.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.318
What's that old thing?

21:18.402 --> 21:23.323
{\an4}This? Why, the finest
dog-grooming mechanism
on the market.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.992
Carelessly thrown in the trash.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.368
But if it was
good enough

21:26.451 --> 21:26.952
for the Randalls'
Pekinese

21:27.035 --> 21:29.079
it's good enough
for you.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.330
(<i> click, buzzing...</i> )

21:35.752 --> 21:38.505
Oh... velvet.

21:38.588 --> 21:42.092
{\an4}Oh, Ginger, there's
all sorts of fashion
available to you now!

21:42.175 --> 21:44.803
Oh... I don't know
how to thank you, Carl.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.222
This is a fine start.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.557
See me once a week.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.686
Pretty soon I'll have enough
for a goatee and sideburns.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.444
{\an4}I'll be needing
those math problems
by the end of the day.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.697
(<i> gasps</i> )

22:03.780 --> 22:05.365
It's over, Miranda.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.825
{\an1}Find someone else
to do your dirty work.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.369
You think you're so clever.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.831
Fine! Where's that little
run-mouth friend of yours?

22:12.914 --> 22:14.124
You mean my best friend Dodie?

22:14.207 --> 22:17.461
She's not doing
anything for you.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.755
Try cracking a book yourself.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.633
Ouch.
That hurt, Foutley.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.055
Hmm...
khaki clam-diggers

22:28.138 --> 22:31.600
with a side
cargo pocket.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.601
How very smart!

22:32.684 --> 22:33.810
I approve.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.896
Thanks, Courtney.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.105
{\an1}I'm glad you're
talking to me again.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.857
Well, you did have
three more days

22:38.940 --> 22:40.233
of cold-shouldering
coming

22:40.317 --> 22:43.403
{\an5}but that statute
of limitations
can be broken

22:43.487 --> 22:45.405
{\an5}when a fashion
compliment is
in order.
