01:42.999 --> 01:44.812
You've got them mixed up.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.233
You're making
a mistake.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.737
You're making a mistake
with the reindeer.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.822
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:57.826 --> 02:01.913
Would you mind stepping out
for a moment? Open the door.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.502
I'm sorry. The store
isn't open today. I'm just-

02:08.586 --> 02:11.506
I don't want to buy anything, and
I'm sorry to interrupt you in your work.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.675
But I wanted to tell you
you're making a rather serious mistake.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.844
Huh?
With the reindeer, I mean.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.055
You've got Cupid
where Blitzen should be.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.809
And Dasher- Oh, Dasher should be
on my right-hand side.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.144
He should, huh?
Yes. Yes.

02:25.229 --> 02:29.607
Oh, and another thing. Donner's antlers
have got four points instead of three.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.360
Still, I don't suppose anybody
would notice that except myself.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.529
Nah, I don't suppose so.
No.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.197
Well, bye.
Not at all.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.407
Thanks.
Glad to have helped you. Bye.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.618
Dear, dear.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.043
#Jingle bells, jingle bells #

02:49.127 --> 02:52.129
#Jingle- #

03:12.860 --> 03:15.736
You're on float number three.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.780
You're on the Pilgrim float.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.866
You three, you're on the pirate float
- Mrs. Walker!

03:19.950 --> 03:21.868
Mrs. Walker,
something's got to be done.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.662
That "Rub-a-dub-dub, three men
in a tub" float isn't big enough.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.123
We can get the butcher and the baker in,
but the candlestick maker-

03:27.207 --> 03:29.500
I'm sorry, Mr. Shellhammer, but I've
got enough to do to take care of people.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.544
Oh, dear. I was so hoping-
George.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.569
I beg your pardon, sir.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.863
You seem to have got slightly mixed-up
with this whip of yours.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.240
Allow me. Allow me.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.951
It's quite simple, really.
You don't mind if I show you, eh?

04:04.077 --> 04:06.078
No, sir.
Now. Now then.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.876
See? It's all in the wrist.
Is that so?

04:12.002 --> 04:14.295
You have to follow through,
you know. Is that so?

04:14.379 --> 04:16.547
Yes. It's just like throwing a ball.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.673
If you were to-

04:19.760 --> 04:22.637
You've been drinking.
Oh, well, it-it's cold.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.847
A man's gotta do somethin'
to keep warm.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.807
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

04:26.934 --> 04:31.103
Don't you realize there are thousands of
children lining the streets waiting to see you?

04:31.229 --> 04:34.190
Children who've been dreaming
of this moment for weeks?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.609
You're a disgrace
to the tradition of Christmas.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.738
I refuse to have you malign me
in this fashion. Disgusting!

04:40.822 --> 04:43.032
Tell me. Who's in charge
of this parade?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.409
When you find out,
you tell me.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.329
These pants are gonna fall off
in the middle of Columbus Circle.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.628
I beg your pardon. Could you
tell me who's in charge here?

04:55.712 --> 04:58.798
Yes. Mrs. Walker.
There she is down there.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.633
Thank you.
You're welcome.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.386
Oh, you two ought to be
over on 81st Street.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.305
Mrs. Walker, one of the men in your
parade is not fit to be seen by chil-

05:06.390 --> 05:09.016
What are you doing out of costume?
Get back and get dressed.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.602
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.105
Your Santa Claus
is intoxicated.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.440
Oh, no!
Yes. It's disgraceful.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.734
How can you allow a man-

05:20.487 --> 05:23.280
#Jingle bells, jingle bells #

05:23.407 --> 05:25.282
#Jingle all
- # Stop that! What do you mean by drinking?

05:25.409 --> 05:29.787
You know it's not allowed. It's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.290
I'll warm you. I ought to
take this cane- And I ought to-

05:33.375 --> 05:35.376
Uh, somebody, Julian,
get some black coffee.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.169
Plenty of it, please.
Yes, Mrs. Walker.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.839
Uh, black with a little cream.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.174
Wake me up
when the parade starts.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.261
Oh!
#Jingle bells, jingle bells #

05:45.345 --> 05:48.305
#Jingle all the way- ##

05:48.390 --> 05:52.184
Oh!

05:52.269 --> 05:55.604
Shameful. Absolutely shameful.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.900
Could you be Santa Claus?
Have you had any experience?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.652
Oh, a little.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.904
Oh, please. You've got
to help me out. Madam!

06:03.989 --> 06:06.949
I am not in the habit of substituting
for spurious Santa Clauses.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.702
No! No, I- I-
Oh, please.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.832
Well, the- the children
mustn't be disappointed.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.959
All right. I'll do it.
Oh, good. Thank you.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.295
Come along. Right this way.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.839
Get that costume.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.573
Hello there!

06:51.495 --> 06:53.871
Hello there, boys and girls!

06:57.918 --> 07:00.628
He's wonderful! He's the best we've
ever had, and he didn't need any padding.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.880
What? Padding. He
didn't need any padding.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.757
Oh.
Where did you find him?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.550
I just turned round,
and there he was.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.053
I'm glad you turned round.
I mean, I'm glad he was there.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.055
Just think if Mr. Macy
had seen the other one.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.641
Just think if Mr. Gimbel
had seen the other one.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.643
You want to ride
in a motorcycle or a car?

07:15.727 --> 07:17.645
I'm going to go home
and get in a hot tub,

07:17.729 --> 07:19.939
and I might stay there
until next Thanksgiving.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.358
You really should see the parade.
You worked so hard on it.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.611
If I want to, which I doubt, I can see it
from the roof of my apartment.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.863
Oh, that's right.
You live down the-

07:27.948 --> 07:30.282
Mrs. Walker!

07:30.367 --> 07:33.202
Go ahead, driver.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.965
Hello there, dear!

07:46.049 --> 07:48.884
I just stepped out to see you.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.150
Susan?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.657
Susan.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.955
Hello, Cleo. Mmm. What a
beauty. Hello, Mrs. Walker.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.749
Where's Susan?
She's watching the parade.

08:20.876 --> 08:24.587
Oh? Where? With whom? With that Mr.
Gailey who lives in the front apartment.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.090
Oh, yes.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.385
Oh, I've been keeping
an eye on her.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.347
She can see everything from there.
That's the 50-yard line.

08:35.432 --> 08:39.434
He's so very fond of Susan. When he
asked me, well, I didn't think you'd mind.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.981
Well, I guess it's all right.
I'll go on in in a minute.

08:44.065 --> 08:47.818
Looks like they're having a little
trouble with the baseball player.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.820
He was a clown last year.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.780
They just changed the head
and painted him different.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.616
My mother told me.
Mmm.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.994
Mmm! He certainly
is a giant, isn't he?

08:57.078 --> 08:59.914
Not really.
There are no giants, Mr. Gailey.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.919
Well, maybe not now, Susie,
but in olden days, there were a lot of-

09:08.006 --> 09:09.965
Well, what about the giant
that Jack killed?

09:10.091 --> 09:14.637
Jack? Jack who?
Jack, uh-

09:17.682 --> 09:21.352
Jack. "Jack and the Beanstalk. "

09:21.478 --> 09:24.355
I never heard of that.
You must've heard of that.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.899
Youâ€™ve just forgotten.
It's a fairy tale.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.319
Oh. One of those.
I don't know any fairy tales.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.740
Oh, your mother and father
must have told you a fairy tale.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.159
No. My mother thinks they're silly.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.995
I don't know whether my father
thinks they're silly or not.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.081
I never met my father.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.000
You see, my father and mother
were divorced when I was a baby.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.590
Well, that baseball player
certainly looks like a giant to me.

09:51.675 --> 09:55.344
People sometimes grow very big,
but that's abnormal.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.013
I'll bet your mother
told you that too.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.440
Hello. Uh, I'm Susan's mother.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.360
Yes, I know. Won't you come in?
Susie's told me quite a lot about you.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.404
I'm Fred Gailey.
Yes, I know.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.031
Susan's told me
quite a lot about you too.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.200
Hello, Mother.
Hello, dear.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.328
Won't you have a cup
of coffee?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.372
You must be half-frozen
standing out- Oh, don't bother.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.667
It's no bother. It's all
ready. In that case, thanks.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.296
What do you think of my parade?
It's much better than last year's.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.381
Well, I hope Mr. Macy
agrees with you.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.592
Sugar? Cream?
Both? Neither?

10:35.677 --> 10:37.678
Just one sugar, please.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.267
This is very kind of
you, Mr. Gailey. Sit down.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.436
And I want to thank you
for being so kind to Susan.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.439
Cleo tells me that you
took them to the zoo yesterday.

10:48.523 --> 10:53.569
That's right, but I must confess,
it's part of a deep-dyed plot.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.196
I'm fond of Susie, very fond,

10:56.281 --> 10:59.408
but I also wanted
to meet you.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.370
I read someplace that the surest way to
meet the mother is to be kind to the child.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.374
What a horrible trick.
It worked.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.002
There goes Santa Claus.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.838
Oh! Don't even
mention the name.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.259
He's much better than last year's.
At least this one doesn't wear glasses.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.511
This one
was a last-minute substitute.

11:19.596 --> 11:23.182
The one I hired, I fired.
Why?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.642
You remember the way
the janitor was last New Year's?

11:25.727 --> 11:27.853
Oh, yes.

11:27.979 --> 11:31.815
Well, this one was much worse. Oh.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.027
I see she doesn't believe
in Santa Claus either.

11:35.111 --> 11:40.157
No Santa Claus, no fairy tales,
no fantasies of any kind.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.409
Is that it?
That's right.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.704
I think we should be realistic and
completely truthful with our children...

11:45.789 --> 11:48.874
and not have them growing up believing
in a lot of legends and myths-

11:48.958 --> 11:51.919
like Santa Claus, for example.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.838
I see.
That's the end.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.759
The acrobats were good. They
ought to be, at those prices.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.054
Thanks for the coffee. And
thank you for inviting me in.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.139
It was a pleasure, missy.

12:04.224 --> 12:08.602
Mother, I was thinking, we've
got such a big turkey for dinner,

12:08.686 --> 12:10.562
and there are only
two of us-

12:10.688 --> 12:13.690
Couldn't we invite Mr.
Gailey? Couldn't we? Well-

12:13.775 --> 12:17.778
Oh, don't even think about it.
I'll have a sandwich or something.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.365
- It's an awful big turkey.
- That's not it, dear.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.742
I'm sure Mr. Gailey
has other plans.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.911
No, he hasn't. Have you?

12:25.995 --> 12:29.123
Uh, to be quite honest
and truthful with the child,

12:29.207 --> 12:30.958
I must admit
I haven't any other plans.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.001
I don't want to interfere
- Please, Mother. Please.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.711
Well, I-
Did I ask all right?

12:34.796 --> 12:36.713
Hmm?

12:40.635 --> 12:42.928
Didn't I ask all right, Mr. Gailey?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.639
That all depends.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.060
Dinner's at 3:00.
Thanks.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.272
Susie, honey,
you asked just right.

12:53.356 --> 12:56.066
I'll see you at 3:00.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.360
It worked.
Yes.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.492
I tell you, Mrs. Walker,
he's stupendous.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.911
Everybody's crazy about him.
So is Mr. Macy.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.582
Well, hire him, by all means.
It's perfectly all right with me.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.668
As a matter of fact, it'll save
me a frantic search in the morning.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.881
Yes. That's right.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.301
I'll take care of it as soon as he
gets through. Oh, you'll love him.

13:22.385 --> 13:26.054
I just know that with that man on the throne, my
department will sell more toys than it ever has.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.056
He's a born salesman.
I just feel it.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.477
Yes, yes, yes. We'll talk about it
in the morning. Good-bye.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.312
Good-bye.

13:34.272 --> 13:38.901
And you will find toys
of all kinds at Macy's.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.166
Gee, that sure is
an elegant costume.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.629
Yes. I've had it for years...
and years.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.672
Sure makes a bum out of
the one they gave you.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.467
Ah. But even that one's
better than the one I wear.

14:03.593 --> 14:07.804
You, Alfred? Yeah, I play Santa Claus
over at the "Y" near our block, see?

14:07.889 --> 14:11.683
- No kidding.
- Started about three years ago.

14:11.768 --> 14:16.104
They had a costume, but, well,
it didn't have no paddin' and...

14:16.189 --> 14:19.191
since I carry my own paddin'
around with me, I got the job, see?

14:19.275 --> 14:22.819
You enjoy impersonating me?

14:22.904 --> 14:25.864
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?

14:25.949 --> 14:30.827
Oh, I don't know. It's-
When I give packages to little kids,

14:30.912 --> 14:35.541
I like to watch their faces get that-
that Christmas look all of a sudden.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.294
It makes me feel kind of good
and important.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.424
Pardon me.

14:44.509 --> 14:48.470
I had my daughter and her kids
over for dinner last night.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.726
There you are.
There you are!

14:54.852 --> 14:56.603
Good morning. Now, before
- Good morning.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.356
Oh, my. What a striking costume.
Before you go up on the floor,

14:59.440 --> 15:02.317
I want to give you a few tips
on how to be a good Santa Claus.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.111
Go right ahead.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.738
Well, here's a list of toys
that we have to "push. "

15:06.823 --> 15:09.575
You know, things that
we're overstocked on.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.328
You'll find that a great many children will be
undecided as to what they want for Christmas.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.874
When that happens, you immediately
suggest one of these items.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.168
You understand?
I certainly do.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.922
Good. Now, you
memorize that list, and I'll-

15:24.007 --> 15:26.633
Oh, no. 9.50.
I'll tell you.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.636
When you've finished, come up to the
seventh floor. I'll be waiting for you.

15:32.390 --> 15:36.977
Imagine, making a child take
something it doesn't want...

15:37.061 --> 15:40.606
just because he bought
too many of the wrong toys.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.941
That's what I've been
fighting against for years-

15:43.026 --> 15:45.152
the way they
commercialize Christmas.

15:45.236 --> 15:48.280
Yeah, there's a lot of bad "isms"
floating around this world,

15:48.364 --> 15:50.282
but one of the worst
is "commercialism. "

15:50.366 --> 15:53.952
Make a buck. Make a buck.
Even in Brooklyn, it's the same.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.872
Don't care what Christmas stands for.
Just make a buck.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.749
Make a buck.
Ah.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.335
Oh, don't bother.
I'll put it away for you.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.378
Huh? Oh, thank you, Alfred.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.759
- And what should I do with these?
- Throw 'em on the floor.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.719
I get kinda tired
just sweepin' up dust.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.183
Thanks.
No. Thank you, Alfred.

16:19.228 --> 16:22.981
This way, please.
Right this way, please.

16:23.066 --> 16:28.070
Yes, yes, yes. Peter's a fine name.
What do you want for Christmas, Peter?

16:28.154 --> 16:31.490
I want a fire engine just like
the big ones, only smaller.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.784
It has a real hose
that squirts real, wet water.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.954
I won't do it in the house. I'll
only do it in the backyard. I promise.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.956
Psst. Psst.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.709
Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.

16:42.794 --> 16:46.588
Well, Peter, I can tell you're a good boy.
You'll get your fire engine.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.508
Oh, thank you very much.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.803
You see? I told ya
he'd get me one.

16:52.887 --> 16:56.348
Mmm. That's fine. That's just
dandy. Listen, you wait over there.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.810
Mama wants to thank
Santa Claus too.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.814
Say, listen, what's the matter with
you? Don't you understand English?

17:03.898 --> 17:06.942
I tell ya, Macy's ain't got any.
Nobody's got any.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.319
I've been all over.
My feet are killin' me.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.195
Fine thing promisin' the kid.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.741
Now, you don't think I would've
said that unless I was sure, do you?

17:14.826 --> 17:18.369
You can get those fire engines-
at Schoenfelt's on Lexington Avenue.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.497
Only 8.50. A wonderful bargain.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.749
Schoenfelt's?
I don't get it.

17:22.834 --> 17:27.002
Oh, I keep track of the toy market
pretty closely. Does that surprise you so?

17:27.088 --> 17:29.005
Surprise me?

17:29.090 --> 17:32.509
Macy's sendin' people to other stores.
Are you kiddin' me?

17:32.593 --> 17:35.721
The only important thing
is to make the children happy.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.807
And whether Macy or somebody else
sells a toy doesn't make any difference.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.309
- Don't you feel that way?
- Huh?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.479
Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure.
Only I didn't know Macy's did.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.481
As long as I'm here, they do.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.483
I don't get it.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.820
No. I just don't get it.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.242
Right this way, please.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.120
Good morning, Mr. Shellhammer.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.164
This way, please.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.844
Oh, I quite understand. Your
little girl would like some skates-

18:15.928 --> 18:17.429
but, of course,
you must get her the best.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.432
Because of their little ankles,
you know, they want protecting.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.518
Now, we've got skates, and they're very
good, too, but they're not quite good enough.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.855
You go to Gimbels. They'll have exactly
what you're looking for, I'm sure.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.857
Gimbels! There you are. Here. Here.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.901
There, that's for you.
Merry Christmas. Gimbels.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.363
Hello, my good girl.
How old are you?

18:37.700 --> 18:41.077
Gimbels. Gimbels.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.955
Pardon me. The guard said
I should speak to you.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.541
You're the head of the toy department,
huh? Yes, madam, but at the moment-

18:46.626 --> 18:52.130
Listen, I wanna congratulate you and Macy's
on this wonderful new stunt you're pullin'.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.967
Imagine, sendin' people to other stores.
I don't get it.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.803
Why, it's- it's-
It certainly is.

18:57.887 --> 19:01.139
You said it. Imagine
a big outfit like Macy's...

19:01.224 --> 19:03.850
puttin' the spirit of Christmas
ahead of the commercial.

19:03.935 --> 19:07.687
It's wonderful. Well, I'll tell ya. I
never done much shoppin' here before.

19:07.772 --> 19:12.192
But I'll tell ya one thing. From now
on, I'm gonna be a regular Macy customer.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.569
All right, dear.
Thank you, madam.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.368
There are six more women
out there who wanna thank ya.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.704
Not now. I've gotta
think this thing over.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.916
Well, personally, I think
it's a wonderful idea too.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.211
You think so.
Those women think so.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.339
The point is, will Mr. Macy think so?

19:37.260 --> 19:40.720
This seems awfully silly,
Mr. Gailey.

19:40.805 --> 19:45.225
I thought as long as we're in the store,
you might as well say hello to Santa Claus.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.227
Why?

19:47.311 --> 19:51.064
Well, because when you talk to him,
you might feel differently about him.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.864
Good-bye, Elmer.
Be a good boy now.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.907
Merry Christmas!

20:02.118 --> 20:05.871
Well, young lady, what's your
name? Susan Walker. What's yours?

20:05.955 --> 20:09.791
Mine? Kris Kringle.
I'm Santa Claus.

20:09.876 --> 20:13.169
Oh. You don't believe that, do you?

20:13.254 --> 20:17.549
Mm-mmm. You see, my mother's Mrs.
Walker, the lady who hired you.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.551
Oh.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.888
- But I must say, you're the
best-looking one I've ever seen. - Really?

20:22.972 --> 20:25.891
Your beard doesn't have one of those
things that goes over your ears.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.977
That's because it's real,
just like I'm really Santa Claus.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.148
Oh, go ahead. Pull it.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.529
All right, folks.
Don't crowd.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.449
You have all day to see Santa
Claus. Now, children, behave.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.076
This way, please.
Get back in the line there.

20:45.161 --> 20:48.163
And, now, what would you
like me to bring you for Christmas?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.248
Nothing, thank you.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.459
Oh, come now.
You must want something.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.669
Whatever I want, my
mother will get for me-

20:54.754 --> 20:57.589
if it's sensible and doesn't
cost too much, of course.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.925
Hello, Mother. Hello,
Susan. Hello, Mr. Gailey.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.345
I think you've taken up enough of this
gentleman's time. Come along, dear.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.556
The, uh, explanation for this
is all very simple.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.975
Cleo's mother sprained her ankle.
She had to go home.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.894
So, she asked me
to bring Susie down to you.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.396
Yes, I know. Cleo called me.
I've been wondering where you were.

21:13.481 --> 21:16.066
I thought, as long as we're here,
we might as well say hello to Santa Claus.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.819
He's a nice old man, Mother,
and those whiskers are real too.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.739
Yes, yes, dear. Many men
have long beards like that.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.699
Susan, would you
stand over here a minute?

21:24.825 --> 21:27.243
I want to talk to Mr. Gailey.
All right.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.497
I shouldn't have brought Susie
to see Santa Claus, huh?

21:30.581 --> 21:33.333
Now, you're making me feel
like the proverbial stepmother.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.379
I'm sorry, but it's just that I couldn't see
any harm in just saying hello to the old fella.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.089
But I think there is harm.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.841
I tell her Santa Claus is a myth,
and you bring her down here,

21:41.926 --> 21:46.846
she sees hundreds of gullible children, meets
a very convincing old man with real whiskers.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.141
This sets up a very harmful
mental conflict within her.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.769
What is she going to think?
Whom is she going to believe?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.235
And by filling them full of fairy tales,

22:00.319 --> 22:03.488
they grow up considering life a fantasy
instead of a reality.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.449
They keep waiting
for Prince Charming to come along.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.743
And when he does,
he turns out to be a-

22:08.828 --> 22:11.287
We were talking about Susie,
not about you.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.289
Well, whether you agree or not,

22:13.374 --> 22:16.459
I must ask you to respect
my wishes regarding Susan.

22:16.544 --> 22:20.088
She's my responsibility, and I
must bring her up as I see fit.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.923
Okay.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.849
Say "Thank you, Santy
Claus. " Thank you.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.767
Bye. Merry Christmas!

22:35.521 --> 22:37.605
Well, young lady,
and what's your name?

22:37.690 --> 22:42.485
I'm sorry. She doesn't speak English.
She's Dutch. She just came over.

22:42.570 --> 22:46.197
She's been living in an orphan's
home in Rotterdam ever since-

22:46.282 --> 22:48.491
Well, we've adopted her.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.036
I told her you wouldn't
be able to speak to her,

22:51.120 --> 22:53.413
but when she saw you
in the parade yesterday,

22:53.497 --> 22:55.707
she said you were Sinterklaas,
as she calls you,

22:55.791 --> 22:57.667
and you could
talk to her.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.295
Well, I didn't know what to do. Hello.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.925
# Dankje, Sinterklaas ##

23:48.177 --> 23:51.679
Now do you understand? Yes,
I see what you mean, Mother.

23:51.806 --> 23:56.101
Good. But when he spoke
Dutch to that girl, he was so-

23:56.185 --> 23:59.896
Susan, I speak French, but that
doesn't make me Joan of Arc.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.731
What I'm trying
to explain to you is-

24:01.857 --> 24:04.692
Come in. They said you
wanted to see me, Mrs. Walker.

24:04.819 --> 24:07.904
Come right in. Hello there.
Good to see you again.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.532
It's nice to see you. You're
awfully lucky, Mrs. Walker.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.492
Lovely little girl
you have here.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.663
Thank you, and Susan's the reason I asked
you to drop down. She's a little confused.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.541
I thought you could help to
straighten her out. I'll be glad to.

24:19.625 --> 24:23.378
Would you please tell her
that you're not really Santa Claus,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.131
that there actually
is no such person?

24:26.215 --> 24:28.299
I'm sorry to disagree with you,
Mrs. Walker.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.885
Not only is there such a person,
but here I am to prove it.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.221
No, no, no.
You misunderstand.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.974
I want you to tell her the truth.
Uh, what's your name?

24:36.100 --> 24:39.227
Kris Kringle. I'll bet you're
in the first grade. Second.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.647
- I mean your real name.
- That is my real name.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.607
Second grade.
It's a progressive school.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.277
Oh. It's a progressive school.

24:47.403 --> 24:50.947
May I have this gentleman's employment
card, please? Yes, Mrs. Walker.

24:51.031 --> 24:54.325
This dress is very cute. Where
did you get such a lovely outfit?

24:54.410 --> 24:57.370
Here at Macy's. We get 10% off. Oh.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.707
Please don't feel that you have to
keep pretending for Susan's benefit.

25:00.791 --> 25:04.377
She's a very intelligent child and
always wants to know the absolute truth.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.713
Good, because I always tell
the absolute truth.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.257
Now, about your school.
What's the name of your teacher?

25:09.383 --> 25:11.301
Mrs. Hainey.
Mrs. Hainey.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.429
Here it is, Mrs. Walker.
Thank you.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.598
What else do you do
besides read and play games?

25:16.682 --> 25:19.726
We have rest periods,
one half-hour.

25:19.810 --> 25:22.687
I don't suppose you care for that, eh?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.939
No. We're not allowed
to talk or anything.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.443
Tuesday, Chester Richards,
he kept talking all the time.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.737
My, that was bad.

25:30.821 --> 25:34.032
Yes. Mrs. Hainey made him stay
resting all alone for nearly an hour.

25:34.116 --> 25:38.036
Susan, dear, would you go out
and talk to Miss Adams for a minute?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.996
And I'll be right with you.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.332
All right. Good-bye.
Good-bye, young lady.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.001
Hope to see you again.
Thank you. I hope so too.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.669
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

25:46.795 --> 25:51.549
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr.,
uh- Mr. - Kringle.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.552
I'm sorry, but we're going to
have to make a change. Change?

25:54.637 --> 25:59.224
The Santa Claus we had two years ago is
back in town, and I feel we owe it to him-

25:59.350 --> 26:03.019
Have I done something wrong?
Oh, no! N-No.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.105
Uh, well, uh-

26:06.190 --> 26:09.234
Yes? Mr. Macy wants
to see you immediately.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.319
Uh, I'll be right up.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.076
Would you sit down? And I'll be
right back and sign your pay voucher.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.079
Yes, indeed.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.874
Oh, uh, go right in.
Mr. Macy's waiting.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.127
No, no. The effect that
this will have on the public-

26:28.212 --> 26:30.129
Oh, come in, Mrs. Walker.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.215
Hello, Mrs. Walker.
Hello, Mrs. Walker.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.259
My seat.
Sit over here.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.344
I've just been telling
these gentlemen...

26:36.428 --> 26:39.138
of the new policy you
and Mr. Shellhammer initiated.

26:39.223 --> 26:43.601
I can't say that I approve of your not
consulting the advertising department first,

26:43.686 --> 26:46.854
but in the face of this tremendous
response on the part of the public,

26:46.939 --> 26:48.815
I can't be angry with you.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.067
What's he talking-
I'll tell you later.

26:51.151 --> 26:54.362
Uh, now to continue, gentlemen,
I admit that on the face of it,

26:54.446 --> 26:56.322
this plan sounds idiotic
and impossible.

26:56.407 --> 27:00.076
Imagine Macy's Santa Claus
sending customers to Gimbels.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.706
But, gentlemen,
you cannot argue with success.

27:04.790 --> 27:09.002
Look at this- telegrams,
messages, telephone calls.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.296
The governor's wife,
the mayor's wife.

27:11.380 --> 27:15.049
Over 500 thankful parents
expressing undying gratitude to Macy's.

27:15.134 --> 27:19.220
Never in my entire career
have I seen such a tremendous...

27:19.305 --> 27:21.597
and immediate response
to a merchandising policy.

27:21.724 --> 27:25.643
But R.H.
- And I'm positive, Frank, that if we expand our policy,

27:25.728 --> 27:27.770
we'll expand our results
as well.

27:27.855 --> 27:32.900
Therefore, from now on, not only will
our Santa Claus continue in this manner,

27:32.985 --> 27:36.988
but I want every salesperson in this
store to do precisely the same thing.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.866
If we haven't got exactly
what the customer wants,

27:39.950 --> 27:41.868
we'll send him
where he can get it.

27:41.952 --> 27:45.830
No high-pressuring and forcing a customer
to take something he doesn't really want.

27:45.956 --> 27:49.042
But after all, Mr. Macy
- We'll be known as the helpful store,

27:49.126 --> 27:52.170
the friendly store,
the store with a heart,

27:52.254 --> 27:55.840
the store that places
public service ahead of profits.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.843
And, consequently, we'll make
more profits than ever before.

27:58.927 --> 28:02.764
Oh, yes, I know it's late and we're
all tired and we want to go to dinner,

28:02.848 --> 28:05.099
so we'll continue
the first thing in the morning.

28:05.184 --> 28:09.437
In the meantime, you fellas get together and
figure out the best way to promote this thing.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.356
We'll do that. Good
night, R.H. Good night.

28:11.482 --> 28:14.525
Good night. Good night. Good night, R.H.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.235
I want to thank you two again.

28:16.362 --> 28:20.531
And in your Christmas envelopes, you'll find
a more practical expression of my gratitude.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.616
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.702
And tell that Santa Claus I won't
forget him either. Yes, Mr. Macy.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.834
Imagine! A bonus!

28:31.919 --> 28:35.129
He just assumed it was our idea, so I didn't
- What's the matter?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.256
I fired him.
Who?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.592
Santa Claus.
What?

28:39.676 --> 28:41.969
He's crazy.
He thinks he is Santa Claus.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.806
I don't care if he thinks he's the
Easter bunny. You've got to get him back.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.641
He's insane,
I tell you.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.060
We'll have to hire somebody else
and have him do the same thing.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.896
Oh, no. You heard what Mr. Macy
said. We've got to keep him.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.315
But what if he should have
a sudden fit or something?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.359
Oh, no, no.
I've got to tell Mr. Macy.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.903
But- But maybe he's
only a little crazy,

28:58.987 --> 29:02.573
like painters or composers or
- or some of those men in Washington.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.575
We can't be sure
until he's been examined.

29:04.660 --> 29:08.162
If you fire him and then we find
out that he wasn't really crazy,

29:08.247 --> 29:11.416
Mr. Macy will have
us examined... and fired.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.043
I suppose we ought to be sure.

29:14.128 --> 29:16.087
We could have
Mr. Sawyer talk to him.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.924
Of course. He's a psychologist. That's what he's paid for
- to examine employees.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.802
Now, until we get his report,
we won't say a word.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.804
I'll get in touch
with him right away.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.973
Yeah, but first,
get that Santa Claus back.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.725
The examination won't be worth
a thing without the patient.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.438
It was just because I felt
that we owed it to him,

29:33.522 --> 29:37.275
but Mr. Macy suggested that we find
something else for the other Santa Claus...

29:37.359 --> 29:39.986
and keep you on,
by all means.

29:40.070 --> 29:43.406
Oh, well, thanks.
That's mighty good news. Yes.

29:43.532 --> 29:46.242
You'll be here in the morning
then? Certainly, I will.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.495
You see, Mrs. Walker,
this is quite an opportunity for me.

29:49.580 --> 29:53.541
For the past 50 years or so, I've been
getting more and more worried about Christmas.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.586
It seems we're all so busy
trying to beat the other fellow...

29:56.670 --> 29:59.797
in making things go faster
and look shinier and cost less...

29:59.882 --> 30:03.134
that Christmas and I are sort of
getting lost in the shuffle.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.803
Oh, I don't think so.
Christmas is still Christmas.

30:05.888 --> 30:09.390
Oh, Christmas isnâ€™t just a day.
It's a frame of mind.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.184
And that's what's been changing.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.312
That's why I'm glad I'm here.
Maybe I can do something about it.

30:14.396 --> 30:18.149
And I'm glad I met you and your daughter.
You two are a test case for me.

30:18.275 --> 30:22.111
We are? Yes! You're sort of
the whole thing in miniature.

30:22.196 --> 30:25.323
If I can win you over,
there's still hope.

30:25.407 --> 30:29.160
If not, then I guess I'm through.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.830
But I'm warning you,
I don't give up easily.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.832
Good night.
Good night.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.501
Oh! Oh, Mr. Kringle.
Yeah?

30:36.585 --> 30:39.504
The first thing in the morning, would
you report to Mr. Sawyer's office?

30:39.630 --> 30:42.298
Sawyer? Yes, he'll just give
you a little examination.

30:42.424 --> 30:46.969
Oh, we do it with all our
employees. A mental examination?

30:47.054 --> 30:50.223
Uh, well, uh-

30:50.307 --> 30:52.850
Oh, I don't mind.
I've taken dozens of them.

30:52.935 --> 30:56.103
Never failed one yet.
Know them by heart.

30:56.188 --> 30:59.690
"How many days in the week?"
Seven.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.568
"How many fingers do you see?"
Four.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.612
"Muscular coordination test. "

31:08.909 --> 31:11.410
No damage to the nervous system.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.205
"Who was the first president of the
United States?" George Washington.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.958
"Who was the vice president
under John Quincy Adams?"

31:18.752 --> 31:20.753
Daniel D. Tompkins.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.506
And I'll bet your Mr. Sawyer
doesn't know that.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.841
Good night.

31:37.771 --> 31:42.733
Miss Adams, would you get me the
Brooks' Memorial Home in, uh, Great Neck?

31:42.818 --> 31:45.570
It's- It's a home for old people.
That's right.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.030
I want to talk
to the doctor in charge.

31:56.999 --> 32:00.126
- How many days in the week?
- Seven.

32:00.252 --> 32:03.462
Who was the first president of the
United States? George Washington.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.756
- How much is three times five?
- Oh, you asked me that before.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.175
You'll find the answer
right there at the bottom-

32:08.260 --> 32:11.262
I'm conducting this examination.
How much is three times five?

32:11.346 --> 32:14.181
The same as it was before- 15.

32:17.311 --> 32:20.271
You're rather nervous,
aren't you, Mr. Sawyer?

32:20.397 --> 32:24.150
Do you get enough sleep? My personal
habits are of no concern to you.

32:24.276 --> 32:28.195
I'm sorry. Itâ€™s just that I hate to see someone tied up in
- How many fingers do you see?

32:28.280 --> 32:32.533
Three. Oh! You bite your nails too.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.621
Now, I want you to stand with your
feet together and your arms extended.

32:36.747 --> 32:39.373
Then I want you-
Muscular coordination test?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.584
Surely. Be glad to.

32:45.213 --> 32:49.383
You know, sometimes the cause of
nervous habits like yours is not obvious.

32:49.468 --> 32:53.804
No. Often they're the result
of an insecurity.

32:53.930 --> 32:57.058
Are you happy at home, Mr. Sawyer?
That will be all, Mr. Kringle!

32:57.142 --> 32:59.185
The examination's over.
You may go.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.729
Thank you.
You may go out that way.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.278
And it may interest you to know that
I've been happily married for 26 years.

33:09.363 --> 33:12.573
Really? Delighted to hear it.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.076
Good-bye.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.998
- Get me Mrs. Walker.
- Yes, sir.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.251
And your wife's on 672.
She says it's very important.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.423
Agnes, how many times have I told you
not to bother me at the office?

33:30.592 --> 33:34.595
No. Not a penny. I give you a liberal
allowance. It's up to you to run the house on it.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.639
If that fat, stupid brother
of yours would get a job,

33:36.723 --> 33:38.724
you wouldn't have to be
pestering me all the time!

33:41.436 --> 33:44.814
Mrs. Walker. I'd like to talk to you
right away about this Kringle fellow.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.733
Oh, yes. Dr. Pierce
from the Brooks' Home is here,

33:47.818 --> 33:49.819
and it would be a good time
to settle the whole matter.

33:49.903 --> 33:53.656
Sorry, Doctor, but that was Mr. Sawyer,
the gentleman I was telling you about.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.158
Oh, yes. He'll be right
in. He's just down the hall.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.704
I can't tell you how we appreciate
your giving us your time, Doctor.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.374
Not at all. As a matter of fact,
I was going to call you today.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.711
I had a feeling, along about now,
you people would be wondering about Kris.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.588
Oh, Dr. Pierce,
uh, Mr. Sawyer.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.674
How do you do? How do
you do? Mrs. Walker.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.884
After giving this man
a comprehensive examination,

34:13.969 --> 34:15.969
it's my considered opinion
he should be dismissed immediately.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.306
Really? He failed to pass
the examination?

34:19.433 --> 34:22.435
Uh, yes. He didn't answer
the questions correctly?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.687
Well, yes, he did, but there was
complete lack of concentration.

34:24.813 --> 34:28.065
He kept changing the subject.
He was even questioning me.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.943
I don't think there's any doubt about it.
He should be placed in a mental institution.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.945
I don't agree, Mr. Sawyer.

34:33.029 --> 34:36.574
People are only institutionalized to prevent
them from harming themselves or other people.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.326
Now, Mr. Kringle
is incapable of either.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.954
His is a delusion for good. He only
wants to be friendly and helpful.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.958
That's what I feel too. There are thousands of
people walking around with similar delusions,

34:46.042 --> 34:48.085
living perfectly normal lives
in every other respect.

34:48.170 --> 34:51.422
A famous example
is that fellow, uh, uh-

34:51.505 --> 34:55.926
Well, I can't think of his name, but for
years he's insisted he's a Russian prince.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.930
There's been all kinds of evidence to prove
him wrong, but nothing has shaken his story.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.932
Is he in an institution? No.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.060
He owns a famous restaurant in Hollywood
and is a highly respected citizen.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.731
Dr. Pierce, I've made a great
study of abnormal psychology...

35:08.815 --> 35:11.692
and I've found from experience that
when a fixed delusion is challenged,

35:11.777 --> 35:13.402
the deluded is apt
to become violent.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.905
I'm afraid I'll have to
disagree with you again. But I-

35:15.989 --> 35:17.948
If you tell Kris
there is no Santa Claus,

35:18.033 --> 35:20.701
I grant you he'll argue the point,
but he'll not become violent.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.454
His whole manner
suggests aggressiveness.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.831
Look at the way he carries that cane-
and he's never without it.

35:25.916 --> 35:30.795
I know Kris always carries a cane, but surely
you're not implying he'd use the cane as a weapon.

35:30.879 --> 35:35.341
Uh- Mrs. Walker, naturally,
I can't discharge this man.

35:35.425 --> 35:39.011
That's up to you, but you asked for
my opinion, and I've given it to you.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.931
So, when he exhibits his latent maniacal
tendencies, which I assure you he will,

35:42.015 --> 35:45.059
please realize the responsibility
is completely yours.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.733
Uh, speaking of delusions.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.110
Now we're right back
where we started.

35:55.195 --> 35:59.073
No, we're not. After listening to Dr.
Pierce, I feel perfectly confident.

35:59.157 --> 36:02.243
Yes, but if anything happens,
you won't get blamed, I will.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.703
Mrs. Walker,
nothing's going to happen.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.665
And please don't feel that what I've said
was prompted by my affection for Kris.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.709
- My specialty is geriatrics.
- Huh?

36:10.794 --> 36:13.003
The treatment
of the diseases of old age.

36:13.088 --> 36:18.425
I've had quite a bit of experience, and I assure
you Kris has no "latent maniacal tendencies. "

36:18.510 --> 36:21.846
You'll probably want to discuss this with
Mr. Shellhammer, so I'll be on my way.

36:21.972 --> 36:23.848
May I see Kris?
Why certainly, Doctor.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.226
Use the employees' elevator. It's much
quicker. It's the same one you came up.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.937
Now, where is that? I'm a little
twisted. I'll show you, Doctor.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.147
That isn't necessary.
I'll find my way.

36:32.232 --> 36:35.025
You understand
my position, Doctor.

36:35.110 --> 36:38.779
If thereâ€™s the slightest possibility of his
becoming violent or getting into any trouble,

36:38.905 --> 36:40.865
I could
- What possible trouble could he get into?

36:40.949 --> 36:43.909
All that's got to happen is for
a policeman to ask him his name.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.287
A big argument-
clang-clang, Bellevue.

36:46.371 --> 36:50.624
You can prevent that very simply. There must be
someone at the store who could rent a room out to him.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.294
Then they could both ride
to and from work together.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.547
I'd just as soon he didn't take that long
train ride out to Great Neck twice a day.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.550
That'd solve everything. If someone was with
him, they could steer him away from trouble.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.886
You mean,
sort of take custody of him?

37:02.012 --> 37:04.555
Do you think he'd agree to that?
I'll talk to him. I'm sure he will.

37:04.681 --> 37:06.265
In that case, he can stay.
Good.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.602
Thank you. It's the seventh floor,
Doctor, and thank you very much.

37:09.686 --> 37:11.645
You're welcome. Bye.
Bye, Doctor.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.900
Well, I'm sure you made
a wise decision.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.402
Now, let's see.
Who could rent him a room?

37:18.528 --> 37:22.364
You. Your son's away at school.
What about his room? Well, I-

37:22.449 --> 37:24.783
Well, I don't mind.

37:24.868 --> 37:27.912
I'd be glad to, but I'm positive
Mrs. Shellhammer wouldn't like it.

37:27.996 --> 37:31.832
She's a little-
Say, I have an idea.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.834
We always have martinis
before dinner.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.836
I'll make them
double strength tonight.

37:35.921 --> 37:39.131
I'll bet after a couple of them,
she'll be more receptive to the idea.

37:39.215 --> 37:42.635
But Kris is through work at 6:00.
What about the in-between time?

37:42.719 --> 37:44.887
You'll take him home
to dinner.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.097
I'll call you as soon as my wife's plast
- uh, feeling gay.

37:47.223 --> 37:49.016
Oh, no.
Really, Mrs. Walker.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.977
If I am willing to let my wife
have a big headache in the morning,

37:52.062 --> 37:54.355
the least you can do is to have
a little headache tonight.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.523
All right. Won't take but an hour or so.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.609
By that time, everything
will be quite all right.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.279
Oh, good. Very good.

38:02.364 --> 38:05.783
What sort of games do you play with the
other children in the apartment building here?

38:05.867 --> 38:08.077
I don't play much with them.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.663
- They play silly games.
- They do?

38:10.747 --> 38:13.624
Like today, they were
in the basement playing zoo,

38:13.708 --> 38:15.918
and all of them were animals!

38:16.002 --> 38:19.213
When I came down, Homer-
He was supposed to be the zookeeper.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.299
He said, "What kind
of an animal are you?"

38:22.384 --> 38:25.010
And I said, "I'm not an animal.
I'm a girl. "

38:25.095 --> 38:29.264
And he said, "Only animals allowed
here. Good-bye. " So I came upstairs.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.558
Why didn't you tell him
you were a lion or a bear?

38:31.685 --> 38:34.645
Because I'm not a bear or a lion. Yes.

38:34.729 --> 38:38.691
But the other children were only children,
and they were pretending to be animals.

38:38.817 --> 38:42.111
But that's what makes the game
so silly. Oh, I don't think so.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.571
Sounds like
a wonderful game to me.

38:44.656 --> 38:48.242
Of course, in order to play it,
you've got to have an imagination.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.621
Do you know
what the imagination is?

38:52.706 --> 38:56.667
Oh, sure. That's when you see things,
but they're not really there.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.295
Well, that can be caused
by other things too.

39:00.380 --> 39:06.260
No, to me the imagination is a place all by itself
- a separate country.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.929
Now, you've heard of the French
nation, the British nation.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.098
Well, this is
the Imagination.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.142
It's a wonderful place.

39:13.226 --> 39:18.605
How would you like to be able to
make snowballs in the summertime, eh?

39:19.607 --> 39:23.569
Or drive a great big bus
right down Fifth Avenue.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.238
How would you like to have
a ship all to yourself...

39:26.322 --> 39:30.242
that makes daily trips
to China and Australia?

39:30.326 --> 39:33.537
How would you like to be
the Statue of Liberty in the morning...

39:33.621 --> 39:37.124
and in the afternoon fly south
with a flock of geese?

39:39.502 --> 39:42.921
It's very simple.
Of course, it takes practice.

39:43.006 --> 39:47.551
Now, the first thing you've
got to learn is how to pretend.

39:47.635 --> 39:51.597
And the next time Homer says,
"What kind of animal are you?"

39:51.681 --> 39:53.807
You tell him
you're a monkey.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.685
But I don't know how to
be a monkey. Sure you do.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.855
Here. I'll show you. Now, just bend
your body over a little like that.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.857
Let your arms hang loose.
See?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.151
Now put your right hand
up here, under here.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.946
That's right. Now scratch yourself.
See? That's right. Now, then.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.283
Put your tongue under your lips,
over your teeth. Hmm?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.577
Like this?
Like that. That's right.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.913
Now, then, scratch
yourself and chatter. See?

40:20.627 --> 40:23.462
On the contrary, Haislip, Haislip,
Sherman, Mackenzie and Haislip...

40:23.546 --> 40:25.089
have been very kind to me.

40:25.173 --> 40:28.926
But being an exceptional lawyer,
I want to open my own office.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.595
Would you put this in
Susan's place for me, please?

40:31.679 --> 40:35.099
I think you can take the meat out.
It should be done.

40:35.225 --> 40:38.352
No, no.
Don't forget to scratch now.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.729
Put your tongue up
in front of the teeth.

40:40.855 --> 40:44.608
That's right. Talk to the other
monkeys. What's going on here?

40:44.692 --> 40:47.736
Oh. We're just having
our first lesson in pretending.

40:47.862 --> 40:50.823
Doing quite well at it too.
That's right. Go on now.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.117
Call the other monkeys.
That's right.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.494
Now you're a goose.
No, you mustn't be a goose.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.913
Be a monkey. See?

40:58.039 --> 41:00.040
Mr. Kringle?
Yes?

41:00.125 --> 41:04.128
Mrs. Walker just happened to mention that
they're looking for a room for you here in town.

41:04.212 --> 41:08.090
That's right. Dr. Pierce doesn't want
me to make that long trip every day.

41:08.174 --> 41:10.926
Well, I was just thinking.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.137
I'm all alone in my apartment-

41:13.221 --> 41:16.181
twin beds and plenty of room.

41:16.266 --> 41:20.352
Um, if youâ€™d like to move in with me,
I'd be only too happy to have you.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.979
That's awfully nice of you.

41:22.063 --> 41:25.274
You could ride to and from work
every day with Mrs. Walker and-

41:25.358 --> 41:27.651
Yes.

41:27.735 --> 41:31.071
Give me a chance to really
talk things over with her.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.659
Now, don't forget to scratch.
You're not scratching.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.661
You're not-

41:37.745 --> 41:40.664
Besides, I could see Susie
now and then. Yes.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.708
Mr. Gailey, it's a deal.
Good.

41:42.792 --> 41:45.544
- We'll drive out after dinner
and get your things.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.381
Thanks. Hello? Oh, yes. Just a moment.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.717
It's a Mr. Shellhammer.
Thanks.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.928
Hello? Hello, Mr. Shellhammer.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.974
Yes. Just a moment. Mrs.
Shellhammer wants to talk to you.

42:00.643 --> 42:04.813
I made the martinis triple strength,
and she feels wonderful.

42:06.566 --> 42:08.984
Here, my pet.

42:09.068 --> 42:11.486
Thank you. Hello?

42:13.198 --> 42:16.909
Hello? No, no, no, no. No, dear.

42:16.993 --> 42:19.286
Thank you, darling.

42:20.705 --> 42:24.458
Hello!
No, no, no, dear.

42:24.584 --> 42:28.503
There. Oh, darling! How silly of me.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.924
Hello!

42:34.677 --> 42:37.888
Why, we'd love to have Santa Claus
come and stay with us.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.973
Mm-hmm.

42:40.058 --> 42:43.310
I think it would be
simply charming.

42:43.394 --> 42:47.189
Oh, and so do I, Mrs. Shellhammer.
Just a moment.

42:48.358 --> 42:50.692
It's Mrs. Shellhammer,
and they have the loveliest room,

42:50.777 --> 42:52.819
and they'd be so happy
if youâ€™d stay with them.

42:52.904 --> 42:56.156
That's very sweet of them.
Please thank them very much.

42:56.282 --> 43:00.786
But I'm going to stay with
Mr. Gailey. Mr. Gailey?

43:00.870 --> 43:03.664
I think I'd better
get the meat.

43:06.501 --> 43:09.836
Yes, I understand that, but there must
be something you want for Christmas,

43:09.921 --> 43:12.381
something you haven't even
told your mother about, eh?

43:12.507 --> 43:14.883
Ah, come on now.

43:14.968 --> 43:17.844
Why don't you
give me a chance?

43:18.805 --> 43:20.722
Well-

43:37.365 --> 43:39.449
That's what I want
for Christmas.

43:39.534 --> 43:43.245
- You mean a doll's house like this?
- No, a real house.

43:43.371 --> 43:46.415
A real
- If youâ€™re really Santa Claus, you can get it for me.

43:46.499 --> 43:50.085
And if you can't, you're only a nice
man with a white beard, like Mother said.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.087
Now, wait a minute, Susie.

43:52.171 --> 43:55.549
Just because every child can't get his wish,
that doesn't mean there isn't a Santa Claus.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.926
That's what I thought
you'd say.

43:58.011 --> 44:02.472
No, but don't you see, dear? Some children
wish for things they couldn't possibly use-

44:02.557 --> 44:05.392
like real locomotives
or B-29s.

44:05.476 --> 44:09.021
But this isn't like
a locomotive or a B-29.

44:09.105 --> 44:11.481
It's awful big
for a little girl like you.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.443
What could you possibly do
with a house like this?

44:14.569 --> 44:18.530
Live in it with my mother. But
you've got this lovely apartment.

44:18.614 --> 44:20.532
I don't think it's lovely.

44:20.616 --> 44:24.619
I want a backyard with a great
big tree to put a swing on and-

44:28.291 --> 44:31.835
- I guess you can't get it, huh?
- I didn't say that.

44:33.046 --> 44:34.963
No.

44:38.676 --> 44:43.430
Well, it's a tall order,
but I'll do my best.

44:44.432 --> 44:47.100
- May I keep this picture?
- Mm-hmm.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.353
Thank you.

44:49.479 --> 44:51.772
Good night, Susie.
Good night, Mr. Kringle.

45:40.488 --> 45:42.280
Nice place you've got here.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.324
And was I lucky
to get it.

45:44.450 --> 45:49.204
You, uh
- You like living in Manhattan? Oh, it's all right.

45:49.288 --> 45:52.416
Of course, someday I'd like
to get a place on Long Island.

45:52.500 --> 45:56.920
Not a big house, just one of those
junior partner deals around Manhasset.

45:57.004 --> 46:00.006
I know just the kind
of place you mean.

46:00.091 --> 46:03.260
One of those little, uh,
colonial houses.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.345
Mm-hmm. Either that
or a Cape Cod.

46:05.430 --> 46:09.057
Yeah. You know, I think
you're right about Mrs. Walker.

46:09.142 --> 46:13.019
A little more effort on your part,
and she might crawl out of that shell.

46:13.104 --> 46:15.397
Take her out to dinner
or the theater.

46:15.481 --> 46:18.650
Mmm. I've tried that.
She's always too busy with her job.

46:18.734 --> 46:20.652
Well, try a little harder.

46:20.736 --> 46:24.239
Those two are a couple of lost souls,
and it's up to us to help them.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.867
I'll take care of Susie
if youâ€™ll take care of her mother.

46:26.993 --> 46:28.827
It's a deal.
Good. Ready?

46:28.911 --> 46:31.288
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not
going to be cheated this way.

46:31.372 --> 46:34.666
All my life I've wondered something,
and now's my chance to find out.

46:34.750 --> 46:38.587
I'm gonna find the answer to a question
that's puzzled the world for centuries.

46:38.671 --> 46:42.924
Does Santa Claus sleep
with his whiskers outside or in?

46:43.009 --> 46:44.926
Always sleep with them out.

46:45.052 --> 46:48.054
Cold air makes 'em grow.
Ah.

46:54.103 --> 46:56.855
Joe, we're running out of books.
I'll get some for you right away.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.065
And I need some more
Wanamaker's!

47:23.549 --> 47:25.300
Yes, I know just what you want.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.011
We don't carry that brand,
but I think Gimbels does.

47:28.095 --> 47:31.056
Let me see.
Yes, here it is!

47:31.140 --> 47:32.933
I thought I noticed it before.

47:33.059 --> 47:37.479
2.98. Looks like an exceptional
bargain. Yes. Yes, it does.

47:37.605 --> 47:40.190
Thank you.
Not at all. Not at all.

47:48.950 --> 47:50.909
And why didn't one of you
think of this idea?

47:50.993 --> 47:53.954
It's the greatest goodwill policy
I ever heard of.

47:54.038 --> 47:59.334
Every shopper in New York City suddenly
thinks of Macy as a benevolent soul,

47:59.418 --> 48:02.254
thinking only of the welfare
of the public.

48:02.338 --> 48:06.508
And what does that make Gimbel?
Nothing but a profiteering money-grubber.

48:06.592 --> 48:07.968
Well, two can play at this game.

48:08.052 --> 48:12.264
From now on, if we haven't got what the
customer wants, send him back to Macy's.

48:12.348 --> 48:14.266
And what's more,
we'll do the same thing...

48:14.350 --> 48:17.561
in our stores in Philadelphia,
Milwaukee and Pittsburgh.

48:17.687 --> 48:21.439
Now get to work on it right away.
Can you imagine anything like that?

48:21.524 --> 48:25.819
So, Gimbel's doing it in Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh and Milwaukee, eh?

48:25.945 --> 48:29.573
Yes, and very successfully. Well,
we can cover the country too.

48:29.657 --> 48:34.369
Notify our stores in San Francisco, Atlanta,
Toledo and Newark to get going right away.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.413
All right, R.H.
All right, Mr. Macy.

48:38.291 --> 48:41.042
Look this way, Mr. Gimbel.
Hold it, Mr. Gimbel.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.044
Now one more.
Shake hands!

48:43.170 --> 48:45.589
That's fine! Thanks! Good.

48:45.715 --> 48:48.592
Now we'll take some at my
store. Uh, just a minute.

48:48.676 --> 48:52.262
I have something I'd like
to give our friend here.

48:52.346 --> 48:57.183
This is just a little something to show
my appreciation for all you've done.

48:57.268 --> 48:59.394
Thank you, Mr. Macy.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.439
Ooh! That's very kind of you.

49:02.523 --> 49:06.026
I didn't think you were that generous.

49:06.110 --> 49:08.486
That's a bit of money.
What are you going to do with it?

49:09.822 --> 49:14.618
Well, I have a friend- a doctor.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.954
He's been very kind to me.
He needs an X-ray machine.

49:18.039 --> 49:20.498
Oh, I don't think
that's going to be enough.

49:20.625 --> 49:23.168
I better give you-
I'll make up the difference.

49:23.252 --> 49:27.839
- Buy it through the store and get 10% discount.
- I can get it for cost.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.723
Good night, Susan.
Good night, Cleo.

49:38.017 --> 49:40.477
Would you like me to sing you
a little good-night song?

49:40.561 --> 49:42.187
If you want to.

49:44.065 --> 49:47.692
Doesn't your mother ever sing to
you at night? Mm-mmm. Why should she?

49:49.070 --> 49:54.115
Oh, no reason.
I- I just think it's kind of nice.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.035
- Do you like "Market"?
- All right.

49:57.119 --> 50:01.122
# To market, to market
to buy a fat pig #

50:01.207 --> 50:04.376
# Home again, home again
Jiggety jig #

50:04.460 --> 50:07.796
# To market, to market
to buy a fat hog #

50:07.880 --> 50:12.759
# Home again, home again
Jiggety- ##

50:16.472 --> 50:18.431
Amazing.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.102
- Do you happen to have
a spare piece? - Mm-hmm.

50:32.405 --> 50:35.240
Well, here goes.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.961
Oh!

51:03.060 --> 51:05.145
Hello, Alfred.
Hello, Kris.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.647
How about a little game
of checkers after lunch, eh?

51:07.732 --> 51:10.483
Leave us not today, Kris.
I- I don't feel like it.

51:10.609 --> 51:14.779
Oh, what's the matter?
Nothing. Nothing.

51:14.864 --> 51:17.407
Well, something is wrong.
What is it?

51:18.993 --> 51:24.038
Well, remember I was telling you how I liked to
play Santa Claus over at the "Y" on Christmas...

51:24.165 --> 51:27.584
and
- and give out packages to the young kids? Yeah.

51:27.668 --> 51:30.628
Well, I was telling that
to Mr. Sawyer, see, and-

51:30.713 --> 51:32.630
Well, he says that's very bad.

51:32.715 --> 51:34.758
Sawyer? You mean-

51:34.842 --> 51:37.969
That's the one. He's a psy-
a psychologist, you know.

51:38.053 --> 51:40.722
Well, that's a debatable point.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.391
Why is it bad? Does he say? Oh, sure.

51:43.476 --> 51:48.521
He says that guys who dress up like Santa
Claus, see, and give presents away...

51:48.606 --> 51:51.608
do it because when they was young,
they must've did something bad,

51:51.692 --> 51:53.651
and they feel guilty about it.

51:53.736 --> 51:56.821
So now they do something they think
is good to make up for it, see?

51:56.906 --> 51:58.865
It's what he calls
"a guilt complex. "

52:02.161 --> 52:05.205
How old are you, Alfred?
Seventeen.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.415
Seventeen.

52:07.541 --> 52:11.586
It doesn't seem to me that you've had time to
be guilty of anything much except overeating.

52:11.670 --> 52:16.007
It's nothing to laugh about, Kris.
It's pretty serious, he says.

52:16.091 --> 52:18.343
It's a lot of rubbish, Alfred.
Don't listen to him.

52:18.427 --> 52:20.637
Oh, he knows what he's talking about.

52:20.721 --> 52:23.223
He's been studying that stuff
for a long time.

52:23.307 --> 52:28.853
Oh. Well, what's the basis of this
guilt complex you're supposed to have?

52:28.938 --> 52:31.314
Does he say that?

52:31.398 --> 52:34.234
Well, he ain't found out yet.

52:34.318 --> 52:37.695
It's probably way down
inside of me someplace, see?

52:37.780 --> 52:41.115
Maybe somethin' that happened to me
when I was a baby, he says.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.243
It takes time, but he'll do it, he says.

52:43.327 --> 52:45.620
You mean you're going
to him again?

52:45.704 --> 52:49.207
Oh, sure. I go every day for a little while,
after I finish my lunch.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.543
Uh, he don't soak me nothin'.

52:51.627 --> 52:54.420
He's doing it for free 'cause-
'cause I'm an interesting case.

52:55.589 --> 52:58.591
Yes. What else has he found
wrong with you, Alfred?

53:00.636 --> 53:03.513
Anything else?
No.

53:03.597 --> 53:06.224
Oh, just that I hate my father.

53:06.308 --> 53:08.560
I didn't know it, but he says I do.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.937
And he sees you every day?

53:11.021 --> 53:14.482
Yeah, I just sit in a chair and say
anything that comes into my head.

53:14.567 --> 53:16.276
Excuse me, Alfred.

53:16.360 --> 53:19.612
A few things have just come into
my head, and I'm going to say them.

53:31.292 --> 53:32.917
What do you mean
bursting into my office like this?

53:33.043 --> 53:37.297
Are you a licensed psychiatrist?
What business is it of yours?

53:37.381 --> 53:39.340
I have great respect for psychiatry...

53:39.425 --> 53:42.427
and great contempt for meddling amateurs
who go around practicing it.

53:42.511 --> 53:46.931
You have no more right to analyze Alfred
than a dentist has to remove a gallbladder.

53:47.057 --> 53:51.352
I beg your pardon! Your job here, I
understand, is to give intelligence tests.

53:51.437 --> 53:55.231
Passing yourself off as a psychologist.
You ought to be horsewhipped.

53:55.316 --> 53:59.694
Taking a normal, impressionable boy like Alfred
and filling him up with complexes and phobias.

53:59.778 --> 54:01.988
I think I'm better equipped
to judge that than you are.

54:02.072 --> 54:05.742
Just because the boy wants to be good and kind
to children, you tell him he has a guilt complex.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.077
Having the same delusion, you
couldn't possibly understand.

54:08.162 --> 54:10.079
The boy is definitely maladjusted,
and I'm helping him.

54:10.164 --> 54:12.373
Maladjusted?
You talk about maladjustment?

54:12.499 --> 54:15.752
Seems to me that the patient is
running the clinic here. I won't stand-

54:15.836 --> 54:16.753
Leave this office immediately.

54:16.837 --> 54:18.838
Either you stop analyzing Alfred,

54:18.923 --> 54:22.425
or I go straight to Mr. Macy and tell him
what a malicious, contemptible fraud you are.

54:22.509 --> 54:25.303
Get out before I
have you thrown out.

54:25.387 --> 54:28.514
There's only one way
to handle a man like you.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.892
You won't listen to reason.
You're heartless.

54:31.018 --> 54:34.145
You have no humanity.
Are you going to leave?

54:34.229 --> 54:35.563
Yes.

54:36.565 --> 54:37.899
Ow!

54:44.782 --> 54:46.658
Kris?
Mr. Sawyer!

54:46.784 --> 54:50.078
Mr. Sawyer, are you all
right? Look at that bump!

54:50.162 --> 54:52.330
Mr. Saw- He's unconscious.
Better get a wet towel.

54:52.414 --> 54:55.041
No, better get a doctor.
Mr. Sawyer.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.960
You must have done
something to him.

54:57.044 --> 54:59.379
I tell you, we were merely talking.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.005
The moment I mentioned Santa Claus-

55:01.090 --> 55:03.466
the moment I attacked his delusion-
he became violent.

55:03.550 --> 55:05.635
I told you he had latent
maniacal tendencies.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.846
Well, I think this prove- proves it.

55:08.931 --> 55:11.182
Maybe we'd better have Dr. Pierce
give him another examination.

55:11.266 --> 55:14.185
Dr. Pierce! He doesn't know
anything about this sort of thing.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.438
He's a general practitioner. You
must admit, this is rather serious.

55:17.523 --> 55:19.440
Perhaps we'd better get
a competent psychiatrist.

55:19.525 --> 55:22.944
He's taken dozens of those
examinations and passed them all 100%.

55:23.028 --> 55:26.489
Well, in view of this, it's possible
his condition has changed.

55:26.573 --> 55:28.700
I don't think we can take any chances.
Really, I don't.

55:28.784 --> 55:32.328
I can't see any harm in it. If he passes
the test, he can return to work immediately.

55:32.454 --> 55:35.873
And if he doesn't, well it
- it's better we find out. I suppose so.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.751
You better have the examination
right away, before he tells Mr. Ma-

55:38.836 --> 55:40.753
before Mr. Macy finds out.

55:40.838 --> 55:44.507
Oh, yes. Oh, my, yes. You explain to Mr.
Kringle. After all, you're a friend of his.

55:44.591 --> 55:46.843
I won't do it. I can't do it.
I've grown very fond of him.

55:46.927 --> 55:49.637
This would be like coming out and
telling him that I thought he was insane.

55:49.763 --> 55:53.307
You don't call this acting
normal, do you? Of course I don't.

55:53.392 --> 55:56.394
But there are thousands of other
old people who aren't normal either.

55:56.478 --> 56:00.523
This is going to hurt Kris very deeply,
and I don't want to be the one to do it!

56:08.657 --> 56:11.909
I don't think that would be very
fair to him. I'll tell him the truth.

56:11.994 --> 56:14.037
I always believe
in being truthful with people.

56:14.121 --> 56:18.416
If he sees me or you mention psychiatrist,
it's more or less attacking his delusion again.

56:18.542 --> 56:22.378
He's apt to become violent. But in front
of the children? Oh, but that'd be terrible.

56:22.463 --> 56:25.006
You'd better get him out of the store
on some other pretext.

56:25.132 --> 56:28.217
Then, once outside, I'll
explain it to him. All right.

56:28.302 --> 56:30.219
If you think
that it's better that way.

56:31.638 --> 56:34.474
Please keep a straight line.
All day long to see Santa Claus.

56:41.482 --> 56:43.232
Mr. Kringle.
Yeah?

56:43.317 --> 56:46.903
Mrs. Walker wanted me to tell you we're going
to take some publicity pictures this afternoon...

56:46.987 --> 56:50.073
down- down at the city hall,
you and the mayor.

56:50.157 --> 56:52.158
Good. Like to meet him.

56:52.242 --> 56:54.744
A few things I'd like
to talk over with him.

56:54.828 --> 56:57.789
Oh, but I've made an appointment
with Mr. Macy at 4:00.

56:57.873 --> 56:59.707
Want to tell him
about something.

56:59.792 --> 57:03.211
You'll be back in plenty of time.
There's a car waiting for you downstairs.

57:03.295 --> 57:06.422
It's starting to drizzle.
You'll need a coat. I'll get it.

57:06.507 --> 57:08.382
Thanks. I'll be right with you.

57:08.509 --> 57:12.678
Just want to take care of a few
of these kiddies first. All right.

57:37.204 --> 57:39.122
Where to?
Bellevue.

57:39.206 --> 57:41.207
Bellevue?

57:49.258 --> 57:53.594
- Did she know about this?
- Yes. We all discussed it.

58:02.396 --> 58:05.314
The second party shall, in consideration of
the property hereby agreed to be conveyed...

58:05.440 --> 58:08.734
by the first party
to the second party-

58:08.819 --> 58:10.945
Excuse me, Gertrude.
Telephone.

58:12.948 --> 58:16.242
Hello. Yes. Yes.

58:17.578 --> 58:19.912
Why, yes, we share
an apartment together.

58:22.207 --> 58:26.210
Bellevue? But why, Doctor?
What did he-

58:26.295 --> 58:28.462
Oh, he's quite comfortable.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.464
He's going to be with us
for a few days,

58:30.549 --> 58:34.177
and he was wondering if you could
bring over his personal things.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.429
Yes.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.806
Yes, in view of his examination,

58:38.891 --> 58:41.392
I'm afraid I shall have
to recommend commitment.

58:42.603 --> 58:45.813
Well, yes, I- I know, Mr. Gailey,
but I'd rather speak to you in person.

58:45.898 --> 58:47.815
I'll be right over, Doctor.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.657
See the new patient.
Thanks.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.659
Not at all.

59:07.419 --> 59:09.795
Hello, Kris.
Fred.

59:10.964 --> 59:13.758
Why'd you do it, Kris?

59:13.842 --> 59:16.427
You deliberately failed
that examination, didn't you?

59:19.264 --> 59:21.766
Why?
Why?

59:21.850 --> 59:24.727
Because the last few days,
I've had great hope.

59:24.811 --> 59:27.647
I had a feeling Doris was
beginning to believe in me.

59:27.731 --> 59:30.858
Now I find out she was only
just humoring me all the time.

59:30.943 --> 59:32.860
But I just talked to her
on the phone.

59:32.945 --> 59:35.363
She didn't know anything about
that taking pictures with the mayor.

59:35.489 --> 59:38.574
That was Sawyer's idea.
Hmm?

59:38.659 --> 59:40.576
Well, I'm glad of that.

59:40.661 --> 59:42.787
But why didn't she come to me
and explain the whole thing?

59:42.871 --> 59:44.330
She didn't want to hurt you.

59:44.414 --> 59:48.876
But only because I was a nice, kind,
old man and she was sorry for me.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.879
That's not true. Yes,
it is. She had doubts.

59:51.964 --> 59:54.173
That's why she was just sorry.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.926
If youâ€™d been dragged off here instead
of me, she wouldn't have been sorry.

59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.680
She'd have been furious.
All right. She had doubts.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:04.600
Why not? She hasn't really
believed in anything for years.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:07.478
You can't expect her to suddenly
- Oh, it's not just Doris.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.190
There's Mr. Sawyer.
He's contemptible, dishonest,

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:13.651
selfish, deceitful, vicious.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.445
Yet he's out there,
and I'm in here.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.739
He's called normal,
and I'm not.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:20.449
Well, if thatâ€™s normal,
I don't want it.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:23.786
That's why I answered
the questions incorrectly.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.998
But, Kris, you can't
just think of yourself.

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.917
What happens to you
matters to a lot of other people,

01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:33.296
people like me who believe
in what you stand for.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.674
And people like-like Susie
who are just beginning to.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:39.802
You can't quit.
You can't let them down.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.929
No, I suppose I shouldn't.

01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:46.892
Who knows? Maybe someday, the Sawyers
will be in here instead of out there.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.979
You're right. I ought
to be ashamed of myself.

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.773
Even if we can't win,
we can go down swinging.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:55.067
Let's get out of here.
Now, wait a minute.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:58.779
You're forgetting.
You flunked your examination, but good.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:02.074
Oh, yes. I forgot.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.493
I said Calvin Coolidge
was the first president.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.288
I can imagine what they're
thinking of me for saying that.

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:10.833
But you'll get me out of this.
You'll think of something.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.668
It's not gonna be easy, Kris.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:16.839
Oh, it will be for you. I believe you're
the greatest lawyer since Darrow.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.050
Just a second, Kris. You're
putting me in an awful spot.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:23.512
But I believe in you. You can't let
me down. But you don't understand. It-

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:29.560
I'll do everything I
can, Kris. Thank you.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:31.645
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:40.237
That's a lot of nonsense.
Dangerous, my foot!

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:43.699
I don't care if he failed 10
examinations. You had no right to do it.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.826
Now, you get the case
dropped tomorrow,

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:49.413
or you might have another lump
to match the one that Kris gave you.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:51.499
Yes, Mr. Macy.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.808
"Age unknown. "
Old man, huh?

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:13.604
Very old, Your Honor. I suppose
I'll have to read all this.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.606
You can take my word for it.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.900
Just routine commitment papers-
cut and dried.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:21.153
The man calls himself Kris Kringle.
Thinks he's Santa Claus.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.155
Uh-oh.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.450
Come in.

01:02:26.535 --> 01:02:31.163
A Mr. Gailey to see you, Your Honor.
He represents Mr. Kringle.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:33.958
Better show him in.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:40.714
Good morning. Your Honor, there
seems to be undue haste in this case.

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:44.176
I wish to protect my client's rights,
as I'm sure you do. Of course, of course.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:48.180
If Your Honor please, I request a formal
hearing to which I may bring witnesses.

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.599
I thought you said this was cut
and dry. That's what I was told.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.601
I didn't know anything
about a protest.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.521
You may sign commitment papers now,
if you wish, Your Honor,

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.523
but I shall bring in an habeas corpus
this afternoon.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.984
There's no point in signing.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:04.697
We'll have a hearing on, uh,
Monday morning at 10:00.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.116
Thank you, Your Honor.
Good day.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.706
Thank you.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:23.632
Uh, that man- I heard him say something
about Mr. Kringle before. Who is he?

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.092
His name is Gailey- Kringle's lawyer.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.845
Probably grabbed the case to get
some cheap publicity. Publicity?

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:31.599
We can't have that, Mr. Mara. Mr. Macy
would rather drop the whole thing right now.

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:33.601
It can't be done.
It's too late now.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.686
Kringle has been examined
by psychiatrists at the city hospital.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.856
It has to go through the regular
routine. We must avoid publicity.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.441
I- Oh.

01:03:49.451 --> 01:03:53.037
Mr. Gailey, I represent Mr. Macy.
My name's Sawyer.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.998
Oh, so you're Sawyer.
Yes.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:57.541
Now, regarding
this Kringle matter-

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.544
We're very anxious to avoid
publicity of any kind. Naturally.

01:04:00.629 --> 01:04:03.464
So, if you would agree to put
this matter through, uh, quietly,

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:07.134
I'm sure we could find some generous
way of expressing our appreciation.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.429
Very interesting.
Then you'll cooperate?

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:14.725
Very interesting. Publicity. Hmm.
You know, that's not a bad idea.

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:19.522
If I'm gonna win this case, I'm gonna have
to have public opinion and plenty of it.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:21.273
And publicity's just the way to do it.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.320
Thanks, Mr. Sawyer.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:29.740
Oh, Mr. Gailey. Mr. Gailey, wait
a minute. I just want to talk.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:32.201
Mr. Gailey,
one moment, please.

01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:00.354
Well, I
- I don't see what they're making such a fuss about.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:01.981
After all,
he's an old man and-

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.192
How you been feeling lately, Henry?
You look a little run-down.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:08.612
Me? Why, I feel fine.
Never better.

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:11.031
Why don't you go and see the doc,
take a few weeks off?

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.576
Go fishin'. Go huntin'.
Go anyplace.

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:18.038
Why should I? Because this
Kringle case is dynamite.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:20.749
Let some judge handle it that
isn't coming up for reelection.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:24.837
I can't do that. Henry, listen.
I'm no legal brain trust.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.964
I don't know a habeas
from a corpus.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.592
But I do know politics.
That's my racket.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:32.595
I got you elected, didn't I? And
I'm gonna try to get you reelected.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:35.639
I know, Charlie.
Don't misunderstand me.

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.891
I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:40.519
And I'm telling you to
get off this case. But why?

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:43.689
Because you're a regular Pontius Pilate
the minute you start. That's why.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.317
Oh, I don't believe it.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.319
I'm an honest man,

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:51.905
and nobody's going to hold it against me
for doing my duty as I see it.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.825
Grandma! Grandma!

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:57.286
Grandma! Grandma!
Grandma! Grandma!

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:01.373
Good night, Terry.
Good night, Alice.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.375
Now straight to bed.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.253
I promised your mother you'd be
in bed by 8:00, and it's way past.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:10.299
Aren't you coming too? Mm-hmm. I'll be
up in a minute to tuck you in. Now scoot!

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:14.845
Now, how about a great big kiss
for Grandpa, hmm?

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:19.058
Hmph!
Hmph!

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:24.480
A fine way to treat their grandfather
- no hug, no kiss, no anything.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:28.359
I don't blame them. Any man who
puts Santa Claus on trial for lunacy.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.363
See what I mean?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.951
Hey.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:57.429
Oh, don't worry about me. I've
got the best lawyer in the world.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.390
H- How long do you think
this will take?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.225
Maybe a week.
A week?

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.227
That seems impossible.
All that has to be done is-

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:06.021
You don't think that lawyer's going to be
stupid enough to let him admit anything, do you?

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.108
He's naturally going to deny everything. And
I'll bring witnesses, and he'll bring witnesses.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.860
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:15.656
All persons having business with the
Special Term, Part 3 of the supreme court...

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.866
held in and for the County of New York,

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:21.161
draw near and give your attendance,
and ye shall be heard.

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:27.334
In the matter of Kris Kringle, Your Honor,
the commitment papers are before you.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:30.587
If Your Honor please, I should
like to call the first witness.

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:33.173
Mr. Kringle,
will you take the stand?

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.522
Good morning, Your Honor.

01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:52.317
You do solemnly swear that the testimony you are
about to give in the cause before this court...

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.862
shall be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.947
I do.
Uh-

01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:59.450
Before you begin, Mr. Mara,
I want to explain to the witness...

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:01.452
that this is a hearing,
not a trial.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:06.123
Mr. Kringle, you don't have to answer
any questions against your wishes...

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:08.125
or even testify at all.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.960
We have no objection,
Your Honor.

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:14.047
Oh, I'll be glad to answer
any questions I can.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:19.344
What is your name?
Kris Kringle.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:24.892
Where do you live? That's
what this hearing will decide.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.149
A very sound answer,
Mr. Kringle.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:38.863
Do you believe that you're
Santa Claus? Of course.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.412
The State rests, Your Honor.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:58.133
Well, Mr. Gailey, do you wish
to cross-examine the witness?

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.551
I believe he was employed
to "play" Santa Claus.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.180
Perhaps he didn't understand
the question correctly.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.890
Oh, I understood the question
perfectly, Your Honor.

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.731
No further questions
at this time.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.736
Thank you.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:25.743
In view of this statement, do you still
wish to put in a defense, young man?

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.330
I do, Your Honor.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.999
I'm fully aware
of my client's opinions.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.001
In fact, that's the entire case
against him.

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:35.962
All these complicated tests
and reports boil down to this.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:40.050
Mr. Kringle is not sane because
he believes himself to be Santa Claus.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:44.054
An entirely logical and reasonable
assumption, I'm afraid.

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:49.017
It would be if the clerk here or Mr. Mara
or I believed that we were Santa Claus.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.728
Anyone who thinks
he's Santa Claus is not sane.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:53.729
Not necessarily.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:56.316
You believe yourself
to be Judge Harper,

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:59.111
yet no one questions your sanity
because you are Judge Harper.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.822
I know all about myself,
young man.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:04.950
Mr. Kringle is the subject of
this hearing. Yes, Your Honor.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:08.996
And if he is the person he believes
himself to be, just as you are,

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.956
then he's just as sane.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.126
Granted, but he isn't.
Oh, but he is, Your Honor.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:18.171
Is what? I intend to prove
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus.

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:21.216
He's crazy too.

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:37.399
Hello. Hello, darling. Sorry I'm late.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:41.069
Get your coat. I reserved our regular
table at Luigi's. We're gonna celebrate.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:43.196
What are we celebrating?
Read all about it!

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:46.700
Gailey throws bombshell in New York
Supreme Court. Yes, I read that.

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:50.454
Oh, I didn't see this-
Front page. Good, good.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.498
You're not serious about
this. Of course I am.

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:56.960
But you can't possibly prove
that he's Santa Claus. Why not?

01:10:57.045 --> 01:10:59.004
You saw Macy and Gimbel
shaking hands.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:02.215
That wasn't possible either,
but it happened. Honestly, Fred-

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.135
It's the best defense I can use
- completely logical and completely unexpected.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:07.137
And completely idiotic.

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:09.640
What about your bosses
- Haislip and Mackenzie and the rest of them?

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.642
What do they say?

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:15.479
Hmm. That I am jeopardizing the prestige
and dignity of an old, established law firm,

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:18.941
and either I drop this impossible
case immediately or they will drop me.

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:21.026
See? I beat them to it. I quit.

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:24.446
Fred, you didn't! Of course
I did. I can't let Kris down.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:27.324
He needs me,
and all the rest of us need him.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:30.535
Look, darling,
he's a nice old man,

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.955
and I admire you
for wanting to help him,

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:35.791
but you've got to be realistic
and face facts.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:39.044
You canâ€™t just throw your career
away because of a sentimental whim.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.296
But I'm not throwing
my career away.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:44.758
But if Haislip feels that way, so
will every other law firm in town.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:47.594
I'm sure they will.
Then I'll open my own office.

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:49.763
And what kind of cases
will you get?

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:53.141
Oh, probably a lot of people like Kris
that are being pushed around.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.352
That's the only fun in law anyway.

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:59.189
I promise you, if you believe in me
and have faith in me, everything will-

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.569
You don't have any faith
in me, do you?

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:08.281
It's not a question of faith.
Itâ€™s just common sense.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:14.204
Faith is believing in things when
common sense tells you not to.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.039
Don't you see?

01:12:16.124 --> 01:12:18.542
It's not just Kris that's on trial.
It's everything he stands for.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.253
Oh, Fred. It's kindness and joy and
love and all the other intangibles.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.964
Oh, Fred! You're talking like a child!
You're living in a realistic world.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:27.300
And those lovely intangibles of yours
are attractive, but not worth very much.

01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:30.637
You don't get ahead that way. That all
depends on what you call getting ahead.

01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:33.140
Evidently, you and I have
different definitions.

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:36.059
These last few days, we've
talked about some wonderful plans.

01:12:36.144 --> 01:12:38.228
Then you go on
an idealistic binge.

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.439
You give up your job,
you throw away all your security,

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:43.650
and then you expect me
to be happy about it!

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:46.361
Yes, I guess
I expected too much.

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:48.530
Look, Doris, someday
you're gonna find out...

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.825
that your way of facing this
realistic world just doesn't work.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:55.620
And when you do, don't overlook
those lovely intangibles.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:58.290
You'll discover they're the
only things that are worthwhile.

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:10.427
These reporters make me
look like a sadistic monster...

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:13.346
who likes to drown cats and
tear the wings off butterflies.

01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:17.225
Why, this old man is
- Oh, Tommy. Go in and get Mother's scissors, will you?

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:21.521
They're in the bedroom.
That's a good boy.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:27.027
I don't want you to discuss this case in
front of him. It would break his heart.

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:29.696
And while we're on the subject,
I agree with the reporters.

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:33.742
Mr. Kringle seems to be a nice old man, and I
don't see why you have to keep persecuting him.

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:37.496
Firstly, I am not persecuting him.
I am prosecuting him.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.749
And secondly,
I like the old man too.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.793
I wish I'd never gotten into this.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:45.087
But it's too late now, and
there's nothing I can do about it.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:49.132
It's up to the State of New York, and I'm
just their duly appointed legal representative.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:52.260
Kringle has been declared a menace
to society by competent doctors,

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:55.597
and it's my duty to protect the State
of New York and see that he's put away.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:59.267
No matter what they may say
about me, I've got to do it.

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:03.814
Sometimes I wish I'd married
a butcher or... plumber.

01:14:03.898 --> 01:14:07.484
Well, my dear, if I lose this case, it's
very possible that you'll get your wish.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.540
Hello, Kris.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:36.930
Your name?
R.H. Macy.

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:40.267
You are the owner of one of the biggest
department stores in New York City?

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:41.476
The biggest.

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:45.230
Mr. Macy, if you recognize the gentleman
seated there, will you tell us who he is?

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.232
Kris Kringle.
Your employee, is he not?

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:49.276
Yes. Do you believe him to be truthful?

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.819
Yes.

01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:53.697
Do you believe him to be of
sound mind? I certainly do.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:57.742
Mr. Macy, you are under oath. Do you
really believe that this man is Santa Claus?

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.078
Well, I-

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.335
Well, he gives every indication-

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.755
I asked you, Mr. Macy, do you really
believe that this man is Santa Claus?

01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:21.558
- I do.
- What'd you say?

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.310
That's all.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.616
Psychologist!

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:41.244
Where'd you graduate from,
a correspondence school?

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.330
You're fired.

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.875
Your Honor,
I object to this testimony.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:48.710
It's ridiculous, irrelevant
and immaterial.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.837
Mr. Gailey is making
a circus out of this court.

01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:53.840
There is no such person as Santa Claus,
and everybody knows it.

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:56.509
Your Honor, I submit
it's purely a matter of opinion.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:16:01.056
Can Mr. Mara offer any proof that there is
no Santa Claus? No, and I do not intend to.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.350
This is not a nursery. It's the
New York State Supreme Court,

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:05.977
and I'll not waste this court's time
with such childish nonsense.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.688
Mr. Mara seems to have appointed
himself the judge here, Your Honor.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.274
He's now ruling on
what testimony I may introduce.

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:13.735
Your Honor, we request an
immediate ruling from this court.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:16.655
Is there, or is there not
a Santa Claus?

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:22.035
Well-

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.169
The court will take a short recess
to consider the matter.

01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:37.259
I don't care what you do
with old whisker puss,

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:40.095
but if you go back in there and rule
that there's no Santa Claus,

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.931
you better start looking
for that chicken farm right now.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:45.558
Why, we won't even be able
to put you in the primaries.

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:49.604
But, Charlie, listen to reason.
I'm a responsible judge.

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:51.606
I've taken an oath.

01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:54.651
How can I seriously rule
that there is a Santa Claus?

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.695
Why don't you li-

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:00.615
All right.
You go back and tell 'em...

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.286
that the New York State Supreme
Court rules there's no Santa Claus.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.121
It's all over the papers.

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.957
The kids read it, and they don't
hang up their stockings.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:12.836
Now, what happens to all the toys that
are supposed to be in those stockings?

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.629
Nobody buys 'em.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:17.257
The toy manufacturers
are gonna like that.

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:21.845
So they have to lay off a lot of their employees
- union employees.

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:25.932
Now you got the C.I.O.
And the A.F. Of L. against you,

01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:28.018
and they're gonna
adore you for it.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.313
And they're gonna say it
with votes.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:34.858
Oh, and the department stores
are gonna love you too.

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:38.403
And the Christmas card makers.
And the candy companies.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:43.783
Oh, Henry, you're gonna be
an awful popular fella.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:45.535
And what about
the Salvation Army?

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:50.123
Why, they've got a Santy Claus on every
corner, and they take in a fortune.

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:53.501
But you go ahead, Henry.
You do it your way.

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:58.048
You go on back in there and tell 'em
that you rule there's no Santy Claus.

01:17:58.132 --> 01:18:00.216
Go on.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.427
But if you do, remember this.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.512
You can count on getting
just two votes-

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.223
your own and that
district attorney's out there.

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:12.187
The district attorney's a Republican.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.606
All rise!

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:33.500
Before making a ruling,

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:37.420
this court has consulted
the highest authority available.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:43.843
The question of Santa Claus seems
to be largely a matter of opinion.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:46.721
Many people firmly
believe in him.

01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:48.765
Others do not.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.935
The tradition of American justice...

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:56.064
demands a broad and unprejudiced view
of such a controversial matter.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:19:01.152
This court, therefore,
intends to keep an open mind.

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:05.824
- We shall hear evidence on either side.
- He's crazy too.

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:09.077
Your Honor, the burden of proof
for this ridiculous contention...

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.079
clearly rests with my opponent.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.748
Can he produce any evidence
to support his views?

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.750
If Your Honor please, I can.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:18.837
Will Thomas Mara please
take the stand? Who, me?

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.839
Thomas Mara Junior.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.227
Hello, Daddy.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:38.231
Here you are, Tommy.

01:19:41.193 --> 01:19:45.864
Tommy, you know the difference between
telling the truth and telling a lie, don't you?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:51.453
Gosh, everybody knows you shouldn't
tell a lie, especially in court.

01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:54.706
Proceed, Mr. Gailey.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.418
- Do you believe in Santa Claus, Tommy?
- Sure, I do.

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:02.338
He gave me a brand-new
Flexible Flyer sled last year.

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:06.217
And this year
- And, uh, what does he look like?

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.303
There he is, sitting there!

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.888
Your Honor, I protest!

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.558
Overruled.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:19.689
Tell me, Tommy. Why are you
so sure there's a Santa Claus?

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:22.650
Because my daddy
told me so.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:26.070
Didn't you, Daddy?

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.782
And you believe your daddy, don't
you, Tommy? He's a very honest man.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:34.621
Course he is. My daddy wouldn't
tell me anything that wasn't so.

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:38.625
Would you, Daddy?

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:40.710
Thank you, Tommy.

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:46.090
Good-bye, Daddy.

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:48.259
Your Honor-

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:51.679
Don't forget-
a real, official football helmet.

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:54.140
Don't worry, Tommy.
You'll get it.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:16.162
Your Honor, the State of New York
concedes the existence of Santa Claus.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:27.632
But in so conceding, we ask that Mr. Gailey
cease presenting personal opinion as evidence.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.635
The state could bring in hundreds
of witnesses with opposite opinions.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:34.514
But it's our desire to shorten
this hearing rather than prolong it.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:38.893
I, therefore, request that Mr. Gailey
now submit authoritative proof...

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:42.605
that Mr. Kringle is the one
and only Santa Claus.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:47.569
Your point's well-taken, Mr. Mara.
I'm afraid we must agree.

01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:57.370
Mr. Gailey, are you prepared to show
that Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus...

01:21:57.454 --> 01:21:59.622
on the basis
of competent authority?

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:05.878
Not at this time, Your Honor. I ask
for an adjournment until tomorrow.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.715
The court stands adjourned
till tomorrow afternoon at 3:00.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.181
Well, I- I guess that's that.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.101
There's a way, Alfred.
There's got to be.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.942
Well, it's hard to explain.

01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:30.778
You see, they're having, well,
sort of a trial about him.

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:32.614
You mean like for a murder?

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:34.949
Oh, no, no. It isn't
that kind of a trial.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:37.619
Itâ€™s just because
he says he's Santa Claus.

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:40.538
But I've got a feeling
he is Santa Claus, Mother.

01:22:40.623 --> 01:22:43.291
Some people don't believe that.
That's why they're having this-

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.419
But he's so kind and nice and jolly.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:50.465
He's not like anyone else.
He must be Santa.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.051
I think perhaps
you're right, Susie.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:56.554
Is Mr. Kringle sad now, Mother?

01:22:56.639 --> 01:23:01.142
I'm afraid he is.
I'm sure he misses you and-

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:04.354
Then I'm going to write him a letter
right now and cheer him up.

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:19.595
Hey, Lou! Come here.
Yeah.

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:21.889
Hey, here's a new one.

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:25.351
I seen 'em write to Santa Claus, North
Pole, South Pole and every other place.

01:24:25.436 --> 01:24:28.438
Here's a kid writes, "Kris Kringle,
New York County Courthouse. "

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.481
Can you beat that?
The kid's right.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:32.483
They got him on trial down there.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:36.154
He claims that he's Santy Claus,
and the D.A. Claims that he's nuts.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:39.031
Here. Read it for yourself.
Right on the front page.

01:24:43.162 --> 01:24:48.082
Hey, uh
- Hey, Lou, how many Santy Claus letters we got down at the dead letter office?

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:51.210
I don't know. There must be
about 50,000 of 'em.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:55.715
Bags and bags all over the joint,
and there's more comin' in every day.

01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:59.302
Yeah. Hey, uh- Hey, Lou.
Yeah.

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:02.138
Uh, it'd be kind of nice to get
rid of 'em. Wouldn't it, huh?

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.557
Yeah, but-

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.934
Hey, that's a wonderful idea, Al.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:10.229
I mean, after all, why should we
be bothered with all that stuff, huh?

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:12.815
Why don't you get a couple of trucks
up here- big ones- right away?

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.817
Load 'em with all
that Santa Claus mail...

01:25:14.902 --> 01:25:17.737
and deliver it to Mr. Kringle
down at the courthouse.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:20.114
Let somebody else worry
about it, huh? Hey, Frank!

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:21.365
Hey!

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:24.202
#Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way #

01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:40.384
Hello, Kris.
Fred.

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:45.181
Kris, I'm afraid I've got
bad news for you.

01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:48.267
I've tried every way
to get some competent authority.

01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:51.312
I've wired the governor, the mayor.
I even wired-

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:55.399
This is worth more to me than all
the governors and mayors in the world.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.527
It's all over, George.
Look at him.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:00.154
He hasn't got a thing.

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:17.797
And furthermore,

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:21.008
the defense has yet to offer
one concrete piece of evidence...

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:23.386
to substantiate
this preposterous claim-

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:27.098
not one competent authoritative proof
that this man is Santa Claus.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:31.894
In view of these facts, and especially
since today is Christmas Eve-

01:26:31.979 --> 01:26:34.355
we're naturally all anxious
to get to our homes-

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:37.108
I ask that you sign the commitment
papers without further delay.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.737
Mr. Gailey, have you
anything further to offer?

01:26:41.822 --> 01:26:44.115
Yes, I have, Your Honor.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.158
I'd like to submit
the following facts in evidence.

01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:48.160
It concerns the post office
department,

01:26:48.245 --> 01:26:51.664
an official agency
of the United States government.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:55.376
"The post office department was created
by the Second Continental Congress...

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:58.212
"on July 26, 1776.

01:26:58.297 --> 01:27:00.464
"The first postmaster general
was Benjamin Franklin.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:04.927
"The post office department is one of the
largest business concerns in the world.

01:27:05.012 --> 01:27:07.597
"Last year, under Robert Hannegan,
it did a gross business...

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:12.977
of $1,112,877,174."

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:16.063
Your Honor, I'm sure
we're all gratified to know...

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:18.399
the post office department
is doing so nicely,

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.610
but it hardly has
any bearing on this case.

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:23.738
It has a great deal, Your Honor,
if I may be allowed to proceed.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.990
By all means, Mr. Gailey.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.828
Your Honor, the figures
I have just quoted...

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:34.123
indicate an efficiently run
organization.

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:38.085
Furthermore, the United States postal laws
and regulations make it a criminal offense...

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:42.965
to willfully misdirect mail or
intentionally deliver it to the wrong party.

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:46.427
Consequently, the department
uses every possible precaution.

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:49.555
Your Honor, The State of New York
is second to none...

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.807
in its admiration
of the post office department.

01:27:51.892 --> 01:27:54.060
It is efficient,
authoritative and prosperous.

01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:56.729
We are very happy to concede
Mr. Gailey's claims.

01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:59.273
Um, for the record, Mr.
Mara? For the record.

01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:01.317
Anything to get on
with this case.

01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.361
Then, Your Honor, I want to
introduce these pieces of evidence.

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:07.281
I'll take them, please.
I have here three letters.

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:11.410
They're addressed, simply, "Santa Claus. "
No other address whatsoever.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:14.246
Yet these letters have just now
been delivered to Mr. Kringle...

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:17.083
by bona fide employees
of the post office.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.794
I offer them as positive proof
that a competent-

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.922
Uh, three letters, Your Honor,
are hardly positive proof.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:26.592
I understand the post office receives
thousands of these letters every year.

01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:29.971
I have further exhibits, Your Honor,
but I hesitate to produce them.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:32.390
I'm sure we'll be very happy
to see them.

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:36.477
Yes. Yes, produce them, Mr. Gailey.
Put them here on my desk.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:40.439
But, Your Honor
- Put them here on the desk.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:43.234
Put them-
Yes, Your Honor.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:13.097
Your Honor!

01:29:14.141 --> 01:29:16.767
Your Honor!

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:32.033
Your Honor, every one of these letters
is addressed to Santa Claus.

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:34.201
The post office has delivered them.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.872
Therefore, the post office department,
a branch of the federal government,

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:40.249
recognizes this man, Kris Kringle,

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:43.002
to be the one and only Santa Claus.

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:55.389
Uh, since the United States government
declares this man to be Santa Claus,

01:29:55.474 --> 01:29:57.183
this court will not dispute it.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:30:00.853
Case dismissed.

01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:12.239
I've gotta get
that football helmet.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:22.500
Thank you so much, Your Honor,
and a very merry Christmas to you.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:25.336
Thank you, Mr. Kringle,
and the same to you.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.296
Thank you.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:41.143
Kris.
I had to wait to tell you.

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:45.272
I got your note. It made me
very happy. Oh, I'm so glad.

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:48.442
We're having a big Christmas party
at the Brooks' Home tomorrow morning.

01:30:48.527 --> 01:30:51.445
Breakfast, a beautiful tree and-

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:53.114
I'd like to have you and Susan.

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:57.660
Oh, thank you. I can't think of anyone
I'd rather spend Christmas with.

01:30:57.786 --> 01:31:00.788
Would you- Would you like
to come to dinner tonight?

01:31:00.872 --> 01:31:04.041
Tonight? Oh, I can't.
It's Christmas Eve.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.710
Oh, I forgot.
Good-bye.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.026
Come in! Merry Christmas.
Jingle bells!

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:37.283
Oh! My dear sir. You know
my assistant Alfred, Mr. Macy.

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:39.410
Merry Christmas, Alfred.
Mr. Macy.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:41.370
Mr. Shellhammer, there's something
here I'd like to show you.

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.789
Hello, Alfred.
Mr. Macy!

01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:46.542
There's something down here
that might interest you.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.755
Oh, excuse me.

01:31:59.389 --> 01:32:03.517
Kris, all I can say is the state supreme court
declared you to be Santa Claus,

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:06.770
and, personally and professionally,
I agree with them.

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:12.693
But there are lots of presents
there for you, darling.

01:32:12.777 --> 01:32:14.695
Not the one I wanted.

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.198
Not the one Mr. Kringle
was going to get for me.

01:32:17.324 --> 01:32:20.659
What was that? It doesn't
matter. I didn't get it.

01:32:20.744 --> 01:32:25.247
I knew it wouldn't be here, but I thought
there'd be a letter or something telling me.

01:32:25.332 --> 01:32:28.292
I don't suppose you even
want to talk to me.

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:31.378
Something about a present. Yes, I know.

01:32:31.463 --> 01:32:34.590
I'm sorry, Susie.
I tried my best, but-but-

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:37.676
You couldn't get it because
you're not Santa Claus. That's why.

01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:41.430
You're just a nice old man with whiskers,
like my mother said,

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:43.515
and I shouldn't have believed you.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:48.896
I was wrong
when I told you that, Susie.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.399
You must believe in Mr. Kringle
and keep right on doing it.

01:32:52.484 --> 01:32:55.986
- You must have faith in him.
- But he didn't get me the-

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:58.239
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.

01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:02.701
Faith is believing in things when
common sense tells you not to.

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:04.495
Huh?

01:33:04.579 --> 01:33:08.374
I mean, just because things don't turn out
the way you want them to the first time,

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:11.210
you've still got
to believe in people.

01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:13.254
I found that out.

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:18.050
You mean it's like, "If at first
you don't succeed, try, try again. "

01:33:18.176 --> 01:33:21.053
Yes.
I thought so.

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.601
May I drive you home?
Thank you.

01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:30.771
If youâ€™ll go this way, you'll miss a
lot of traffic. I've written it all down.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.982
See, you go along Maplewood
until you come to Ashley.

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:36.944
I believe. I believe.
It's silly, but I believe.

01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:39.488
Thanks, Kris. That'll be fine.
Merry Christmas.

01:33:39.572 --> 01:33:43.325
Merry Christmas to you. And to
you, my dear, and many of them.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.452
Good-bye, Kris.
Good-bye, my dear.

01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:48.122
Good-bye and the best of all
luck. Good-bye, Miss Walker.

01:33:48.248 --> 01:33:50.791
Good-bye, Alfred.
Good-bye, Susie.

01:33:55.422 --> 01:33:57.548
This must be the turn here.

01:33:57.632 --> 01:34:00.301
That's right- Ashley.

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:02.553
Now you go straight
for four blocks.

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:07.224
I believe. I believe.

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:13.188
Stop, Uncle Fred! Stop!

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:15.232
Stop! Stop!

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:19.820
Susie! Susie!

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.073
Susie!

01:34:24.576 --> 01:34:27.286
Susie, where are you going?
What is she doing?

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:29.580
Susie!
Susie!

01:34:31.958 --> 01:34:33.917
Susie! Susie! Susie!
Susie, where are you?

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:35.961
I'm upstairs!
Come right down.

01:34:36.046 --> 01:34:39.590
You shouldn't run around in other
people's houses. You know better than that.

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:42.593
But this is my house, Mommy-
the one I asked Mr. Kringle for.

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:45.220
Now, Susie. It is, it is! I know it is!

01:34:45.305 --> 01:34:49.350
My room upstairs is just like I knew
it would be. Oh, you were right, Mommy.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:53.479
Mommy told me if things don't turn out just
the way you want them to the first time,

01:34:53.563 --> 01:34:57.524
you've still got to believe, and I kept
believing, and you were right, Mommy!

01:34:57.609 --> 01:34:59.902
Mr. Kringle is Santa Claus!

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:03.155
Where are you going?
To see if thereâ€™s a swing!

01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:06.575
There is one!
There is one!

01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:13.665
You told her that?

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:25.135
The sign outside
said it's for sale.

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:28.263
We can't let her down.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:31.683
I never really doubted you.

01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:35.062
It was just my silly common sense.

01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:37.398
It even makes sense
to believe in me now.

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:39.483
I must be a pretty good lawyer.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:42.986
I take a little old man and legally
prove to the world that he's Santa Claus.

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.988
Now, you know that-

01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:57.751
Oh, no. It can't be.

01:35:57.836 --> 01:36:01.338
It must have been left here
by the people that moved out.

01:36:01.423 --> 01:36:03.882
Maybe.

01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:08.178
And maybe I didn't do such
a wonderful thing after all.
