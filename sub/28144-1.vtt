MAN: Hey sis, it's me.

00:19.454 --> 00:20.976
I got my plane ticket.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.979
I will be getting in first
thing Saturday morning.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.328
And I wish you would
have just let me pay

00:25.329 --> 00:26.678
to ship your car up here.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.203
Maybe you're right.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.945
Maybe this drive is just
what you need right now.

00:35.861 --> 00:36.688
I,

00:38.299 --> 00:40.648
I saw that you deleted
your Facebook account.

00:40.649 --> 00:43.043
I have no way of seeing
that sweet face of yours.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.956
Raven,

00:44.957 --> 00:46.002
I know this is hard.

00:48.091 --> 00:48.918
I miss her too.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.529
Raven, hey, it's me.

00:52.530 --> 00:55.750
I'm so, so, so sorry,

00:55.751 --> 00:57.839
but there's been
a change of plans.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.884
I got called to do
ER duty this weekend

00:59.885 --> 01:01.799
and there is absolutely no
one else that can do it.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.758
It has to be me.

01:03.628 --> 01:04.759
I'm so sorry.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.543
So, my girlfriend Jessica,

01:06.544 --> 01:07.805
she's gonna fly down there

01:07.806 --> 01:09.938
and she's gonna make the
drive with you, okay.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.592
Look, I know, I know,

01:11.593 --> 01:12.419
I know what you're gonna say,

01:12.420 --> 01:13.290
but please,

01:14.161 --> 01:14.986
please give her a chance,

01:14.987 --> 01:15.945
please for me.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.599
Okay, I, I don't think
that you should be

01:18.600 --> 01:21.689
doing this drive
alone right now, okay.

01:21.690 --> 01:24.605
All right, I will see you soon.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.867
I love you.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.087
Stay strong, okay.

01:27.957 --> 01:28.827
Bye.

sad I guess.

04:34.622 --> 04:35.449
It makes me feel bad.

I can't help feeling

I think you're

so last minute.

packed up, ready to go.

Oh, okay.

Um, do you actually mind if
we go inside for a minute?

06:42.445 --> 06:44.751

that we'd just hit the road,

06:46.101 --> 06:46.927
I want to beat the traffic.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.145
Well, of course.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.625
It was just sort
of a long flight.

Uh, I, I would but the
house is already locked up

06:52.281 --> 06:55.370

the kitchen for the landlord.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.111
Really?

06:57.112 --> 06:59.679

gonna be on a road trip.

a squat out back, you know?

07:05.381 --> 07:06.512
Oh, um, yeah, great.

on the second floor

sure was jerking off

other day, but you know.

not there now.

Um, okay.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.312
This is embarrassing, but...

07:24.313 --> 07:25.618
It's fine, man, just you know,

07:25.619 --> 07:26.750
I'll be here waiting.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.194
Yeah.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.066

Don't worry, we're gonna
have a great time, I promise.

been dating my brother?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.394
Almost a month.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.613

talks about you.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.881

weekend actually.

08:54.882 --> 08:57.318
But we were talking online
for a long time before that,

08:57.319 --> 08:58.841
so we really felt like
we got to know each other

really well before we, you
know, actually met face to face.

Well, not exactly
the spontaneous type.

Kind of like super
organized and together.

the word he used.

24:52.316 --> 24:56.537
I can't lie and say
that I haven't utilized it

24:56.538 --> 24:58.147
from time to time.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.193
But no, I wasn't
talking about boys.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.064
But you seem to know quite a bit

25:02.065 --> 25:04.676
about spending some time in
the backseat with a few boys.

25:04.677 --> 25:05.546
What?

25:05.547 --> 25:07.026
No.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.593
I'm a one guy kind of girl.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.856
I don't give it up easy.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.903
Kyle is quit the
catch, isn't he?

25:14.948 --> 25:17.558
JESSICA: Yeah, he is.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.429
Kyle's the best.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.476
Yeah, my brother's great.

25:22.782 --> 25:23.913
He's one in a million.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.397
You bored, you look bored.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.051
No, no, I'm good.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.705
I'm just taking it all in.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.185
It's really pretty down here.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.275
You know I thought I would
be bored but I'm really not.

25:40.408 --> 25:41.670
Okay, so you're bored shitless.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.631
Why don't we play an old
fashioned driving game?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.154
A driving game?

25:48.155 --> 25:49.938
What, you mean like the ones
you play with your family

25:49.939 --> 25:51.461
on long trips as a kid?

25:51.462 --> 25:52.985
Fighting with your brother
and sister the whole way

25:52.986 --> 25:54.639
and bad body odor all around.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.814
Those kind of games?

25:55.815 --> 25:57.032
Yeah, those kind of games.

25:57.033 --> 25:59.034
It could be fun.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.471
A good way to kill the time.

26:01.821 --> 26:05.084
I didn't think you were
the driving game type.

26:05.085 --> 26:08.435
I'm just full of
surprises, just wait and see.

26:08.436 --> 26:11.612
Come on, pick one.

26:11.613 --> 26:15.051
Um, oh God, okay,
how about I spy?

26:16.923 --> 26:17.750
I spy?

26:18.664 --> 26:19.838
Yeah, I spy.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.275
You know, I spy
with my little eye,

26:22.276 --> 26:23.406
and then you have to give a hint

26:23.407 --> 26:25.017
about something that you see

26:25.018 --> 26:26.193
and the other person
guesses what it is.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.281
What, really?

26:28.282 --> 26:30.500
I spy is like the oldest
driving game ever.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.764
I'm pretty sure the
settlers used to play it.

26:32.765 --> 26:36.682
I spy with my little eye,

26:37.857 --> 26:42.775
hmm, something tall
and brown and leafy.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.603
Oh no, here, I've got
another one for you.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.954
I spy with my little eye,

26:48.955 --> 26:53.045
something dead, bloody
and covered in maggots

26:53.046 --> 26:54.743
and splattered
all over the road.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.789
Okay, I don't know.

26:57.790 --> 26:59.312
Look, we can't play
license plates.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.619
That would kind of be hard.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.144
You ever play hot seat?

27:05.145 --> 27:06.536
JESSICA: Hot seat?

27:06.537 --> 27:08.016
Yeah, it's fun.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.845
It's like, uh,
truth or dare, but

27:10.846 --> 27:13.718
more intense, more rapid fire.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.676
I don't know, we're not 13.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.723
Come on, it's a great way
to get to know each other.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.422
Get a glimpse into
each other's character.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.206
I mean, come on, you're
studying psychology.

27:24.207 --> 27:25.992
This should be
right up your alley.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.170
I mean unless, you know,

27:31.171 --> 27:32.693
you have something to hide.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.347
I mean I thought that, you
know, we're friends here.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.219
Didn't have anything to
hide from each other.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.178
Okay, how do we play?

27:39.179 --> 27:40.745
All right, one person
is in the hot seat

27:40.746 --> 27:43.225
and the other person gets
to ask five questions.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.836
Anything you want.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.752
It can be as mundane as,

27:47.753 --> 27:50.624
I don't know, what
was your first pet?

27:50.625 --> 27:51.452
To

27:52.758 --> 27:55.368
Something really,
really personal.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.848
And the only thing

27:56.849 --> 27:58.632
that you have to
answer the question

27:58.633 --> 27:59.939
or you get a little smack.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.897
What do you mean a smack?

28:02.898 --> 28:05.117
Just like a little smack.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.553
JESSICA: No.

28:06.554 --> 28:07.772
Oh come on, it's
like a love tap.

28:07.773 --> 28:10.775
I'll even go first.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.559
Ask me anything you want.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.778
What's your heart's desire?

28:13.779 --> 28:14.605
Shoot.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.827
Hmm, I don't know,
give me an example.

28:20.220 --> 28:24.703
Uh, did you ever cheat
on a test in high school?

28:26.052 --> 28:28.880
Oh, okay, so we're doing
like gloves off kind of stuff.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.143
Well yeah, obviously gloves off.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.232
Especially when it
comes to the smacking.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.103
Haha.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.411
Okay, let's do it.

28:38.412 --> 28:39.499
You're in the hot seat?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.240
Yes, question one.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.589
Shoot.

28:42.590 --> 28:43.808
Okay.

28:43.809 --> 28:44.679
What was your first pet?

28:45.636 --> 28:47.072
Very imaginative.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.290
[laughs]

28:48.291 --> 28:50.380
Uh, it was a parakeet,
named Jemima.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.905
Next question.

28:53.906 --> 28:57.300
What was the worst
job you ever had?

28:58.954 --> 29:00.128
You're really cutting
me deep here, Jessica.

29:00.129 --> 29:01.521
JESSICA: Oh, okay, hold on.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.436
I'm building up.

29:03.611 --> 29:07.309
Alright, um, the
worst job I ever had.

29:07.310 --> 29:12.097
Picking up trash on
the side of the road.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.663
That was a job?

29:13.664 --> 29:18.713
Think about it more like
a volunteer opportunity.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.411
It was only one afternoon
but it felt like forever.

29:22.412 --> 29:25.066
You wouldn't believe
some of the shit

29:25.067 --> 29:26.981
that people throw out
of their car windows.

29:26.982 --> 29:30.115
I mean, half eaten
bags of fast food,

29:30.116 --> 29:31.551
used condoms.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.945
It's disgusting, I
even found a dead bird.

29:33.946 --> 29:36.775
Okay, ew, I've
heard enough, no more.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.082
Wait, was it Jemima?

29:41.083 --> 29:42.388
No, it wasn't Jemima.

29:42.389 --> 29:44.999
Now ask the next goddamn
question, come on.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.479
Okay.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.655
Mmm, how old were you

29:48.656 --> 29:51.701
when you had your first kiss?

29:51.702 --> 29:53.312
RAVEN: Nine.

29:53.313 --> 29:54.487
JESSICA: Nine?

29:54.488 --> 29:55.618
Yeah, nine.

29:55.619 --> 29:56.490
JESSICA: Okay.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.625
Next question.

30:02.975 --> 30:07.021
Have you ever wished you
could be somebody else?

30:07.022 --> 30:09.589
Why would I want
to be somebody else?

30:09.590 --> 30:12.374
What, seriously,

30:12.375 --> 30:14.899
you've never wished you
could ever be anybody else,

30:14.900 --> 30:16.161
even for a day?

30:16.162 --> 30:17.553
RAVEN: No, why would I?

30:17.554 --> 30:20.818
What, okay, that's it,
I'm giving you a smack.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.341
I thought you had
to answer honestly

30:22.342 --> 30:23.951
or else you get a smack.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.431
You're getting one.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.345
Come on, every little girl
dreams of being somebody else.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.347
Fine, fine.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.479
Oprah.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.786
You are full of it!

30:32.787 --> 30:33.918
Oh my gosh, Oprah?

30:33.919 --> 30:35.223
What?

30:35.224 --> 30:38.140
Okay, I'll let it
slide, this time.

30:42.188 --> 30:43.797
Last question, let's go.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.929
Okay, okay, last question.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.061
Last question in the hot seat.

30:47.062 --> 30:48.106
The big one.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.150
You ready?

30:49.151 --> 30:51.370
I'm just dying of anticipation.

30:51.371 --> 30:52.719
JESSICA: Okay.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.549
Who was the greatest
love of your life?

31:01.903 --> 31:02.730
Nah.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.340
I'm not gonna answer that.

31:05.341 --> 31:08.387
No, actually rather I
choose not to answer that.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.997
It's my prerogative.

31:09.998 --> 31:10.868
Okay, come on, spill it.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.086
What do I care.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.348
No, just give me
a smack, come on.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.133
JESSICA: I don't
want to smack you.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.351
Jessica, those are the rules.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.526
Smack me.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.963
JESSICA: I said I'm
not gonna smack you.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.747
Jessica, just shut up and
fucking smack me, come on.

31:20.748 --> 31:21.618
Okay.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.535
You're kidding, right?

31:26.536 --> 31:28.624
What?

31:28.625 --> 31:29.843
No, what do you want?

31:29.844 --> 31:31.236
Are you gonna slap me for real

31:31.237 --> 31:32.411
or you just gonna give me

31:32.412 --> 31:33.456
like that little
pussy bullshit again?

31:34.936 --> 31:36.197
Come on.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.069
Fine.

31:38.766 --> 31:39.984
Ooh, she's got a
little fire in her.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.333
Thank God, I was
starting to worry.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.769
Sorry, you asked for it.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.990
There you go, that's the game.

31:45.991 --> 31:46.947
You ready?

31:46.948 --> 31:48.557
Your turn.

31:48.558 --> 31:49.908
JESSICA: Okay.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.822
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

31:52.823 --> 31:54.085
we're asking Jessica
her first question here.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.783
Did you vote in
the last election?

31:57.785 --> 31:59.568
Uh, sorry couldn't
quite hear ya, uh,

31:59.569 --> 32:01.179
we're gonna need
a verbal answer.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.006
No, okay.

32:02.007 --> 32:02.832
No, I didn't.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.443
Not the last one.

32:04.444 --> 32:05.444
[laughs]

32:05.445 --> 32:06.271
Wow.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.228
All right.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.795
I'm, I feel so enlightened now.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.579
I mean now I know why the
world has gone to shit.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.103
You know, you're
not participating...

32:12.104 --> 32:12.755
JESSICA: Stop.

32:12.756 --> 32:13.974
Listen, I get it.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.933
I respect that you are
a woman of conviction.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.282
But you know,

32:17.283 --> 32:18.545
just don't really care
what happens to the world.

32:19.633 --> 32:20.460
I do, too.

32:21.417 --> 32:22.635
All right, fine.

32:22.636 --> 32:25.203
Um, what was the most
embarrassing thing

32:25.204 --> 32:26.988
that ever happened
to you as a kid?

32:30.165 --> 32:31.036
I tooted.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.691
I'm sorry, did you
just say you tooted?

32:35.692 --> 32:38.085
Yeah, I tooted.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.175
I farted, in class.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.136
That's it?

32:45.137 --> 32:47.877
What, no this was
no ordinary fart.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.140
I was in the third grade

32:49.141 --> 32:50.445
and I was leaning
up against my desk

32:50.446 --> 32:52.012
with my butt in
the air, you know.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.361
And somebody said
something funny

32:53.362 --> 32:55.059
and it just bursted out of me.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.582
It sounded like a popgun.

32:56.583 --> 32:57.975
And then all the
kids stared at me

32:57.976 --> 32:59.150
and started laughing,

32:59.151 --> 33:00.412
including the
teacher, Mrs. Folk.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.980
I must have turned a
hundred shades of red.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.070
[laughs]

33:06.419 --> 33:10.074
I mean, I guess that's
pretty bad for a third grader.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.031
Okay, third question.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.076
Are you gonna ask or what?

33:12.077 --> 33:12.991
Umm,

33:14.557 --> 33:16.863
how many guys have you slept
with, more or less than six?

33:16.864 --> 33:18.473
Less!

33:18.474 --> 33:20.519
Definitely less.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.086
All right, we've got
a virtuous one here.

33:22.087 --> 33:25.351
I mean, albeit politically
lazy but virtuous.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.963
All right, what's
your favorite position

33:29.964 --> 33:31.705
with my brother Kyle?

33:32.706 --> 33:34.663
What, what, what?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.578
No, no I'm not telling you that.

33:36.579 --> 33:37.536
You have to answer.

33:37.537 --> 33:38.624
No.

33:38.625 --> 33:39.451
Those are the rules, Jessica.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.322
Give me your arm.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.891
Ow!

33:45.153 --> 33:46.719
What the fuck?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.852
Sorry, I didn't realize
that I hit you that hard.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.030
You okay?

33:55.946 --> 33:58.558
Fine, I have one more
question and then you're done.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.042
Have you ever wanted
to kill somebody?

34:08.306 --> 34:10.003
Yeah.

45:41.434 --> 45:44.610
in like a dipstick
backwoods kind of way.

45:44.611 --> 45:46.220
Oh my god.

45:46.221 --> 45:48.005
You're kidding me.

45:48.006 --> 45:49.180
Come on, looks can be deceiving.

45:49.181 --> 45:51.225
I bet you his dad owns some,

45:51.226 --> 45:52.226
I don't know, local
textile company.

45:52.227 --> 45:53.837
I'm sure he's worth a fortune.

45:53.838 --> 45:55.490
What are you talking about?

45:55.491 --> 45:56.317
Jesus.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.449
I'll prove it to you.

45:57.450 --> 45:58.320
What?

46:00.366 --> 46:01.149
Hi boys.

46:03.282 --> 46:04.282
My friend over there,

46:04.283 --> 46:06.937
she thinks you're real cute.

46:06.938 --> 46:09.288
[inaudible]

46:13.596 --> 46:14.858
MAN: It's my birthday.

46:14.859 --> 46:17.209
[inaudible]

46:23.824 --> 46:26.914
[soft music playing]

46:27.959 --> 46:28.786
Hey there.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.224
So, what you think?

46:34.139 --> 46:35.400
Excuse me?

46:35.401 --> 46:36.794
About how the other half lives.

46:38.839 --> 46:41.319
Uh, sorry, I don't, I
don't know what you mean.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.886
You're a New York girl, right?

46:42.887 --> 46:45.540
That's what your friend
was just telling us.

46:45.541 --> 46:46.585
Said you're a New York City girl

46:46.586 --> 46:47.586
who wanted to come down here

46:47.587 --> 46:48.500
and see how the
other half lives.

46:48.501 --> 46:49.850
That's why you came down.

46:51.896 --> 46:53.157
You mind if I sit down?

46:53.158 --> 46:54.593
No.

46:54.594 --> 46:55.986
I mean yes, yes.

46:55.987 --> 46:57.510
Thanks.

46:59.904 --> 47:01.296
Ricky, get me another beer.

47:02.732 --> 47:03.603
Please.

47:06.171 --> 47:07.736
So you're Jessica?

47:07.737 --> 47:08.694
Right?

47:08.695 --> 47:10.261
I'm Buddy.

47:10.262 --> 47:11.132
That's Levi.

47:13.526 --> 47:15.180
Pleased to meet you.

47:16.877 --> 47:17.834
You need you another beer?

47:17.835 --> 47:20.184
No, no, I, thanks, I'm good.

47:20.185 --> 47:23.056
Is that really why you
came all the way down here?

47:23.057 --> 47:24.450
I don't know if I buy that.

47:26.626 --> 47:30.324
Uh, actually, I'm
helping my friend,

47:30.325 --> 47:33.327
my boyfriend's sister move.

47:33.328 --> 47:35.852
I mean, move her car up there.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.157
She's moving.

47:37.158 --> 47:38.506
Ooh, I don't know why
I'm telling you this,

47:38.507 --> 47:39.333
you don't need to know this.

47:39.334 --> 47:40.335
I don't even know you.

47:41.728 --> 47:46.036
Well, uh, there's no
call to be rude about it.

47:46.037 --> 47:49.083
I was just trying
to be welcoming.

47:51.433 --> 47:53.783
Maybe you think you're
too good to talk to me.

47:55.307 --> 47:57.787
Your friend said otherwise,
but maybe you do.

48:00.399 --> 48:02.269
I never said I was
too good to talk to you.

48:02.270 --> 48:04.228
I, I never said that.

48:04.229 --> 48:05.620
Well, good.

48:05.621 --> 48:07.405
That's more like it.

48:07.406 --> 48:09.973
Uh, no, I didn't, I didn't,
I didn't mean that either.

48:09.974 --> 48:11.757
Um, excuse me, I have to go,

48:11.758 --> 48:12.976
I have to use the, uh...

48:12.977 --> 48:13.933
Ladies room?

48:13.934 --> 48:14.848
Powder your nose?

48:15.980 --> 48:17.982
You're a New York
City girl, aren't you?

48:24.249 --> 48:26.164
Ricky, where's my goddamn beer?

48:28.775 --> 48:29.994
Lazy son of a bitch.

48:59.545 --> 49:00.371
What the fuck?

49:00.372 --> 49:01.199
Let's go.

49:10.469 --> 49:11.556
Oh God.

49:11.557 --> 49:12.383
I think they're following us.

49:12.384 --> 49:13.645
Who?

49:13.646 --> 49:14.907
Them.

49:14.908 --> 49:16.126
Where you taking
those asses, ladies?

49:16.127 --> 49:19.651
The party ain't over yet.

49:19.652 --> 49:21.044
Is it?

49:21.045 --> 49:22.045
[laughs]

49:22.046 --> 49:23.220
It doesn't have to be.

49:23.221 --> 49:24.525
Do you want it to be?

49:24.526 --> 49:25.397
Oh, hell no.

49:28.748 --> 49:30.444
Well you two gentlemen,
you just wait right here.

49:30.445 --> 49:33.621
I have something real
special I want to show you.

49:33.622 --> 49:34.493
Yeah.

49:37.844 --> 49:38.845
No peeking now.

49:40.673 --> 49:41.935
What you got in there?

49:44.242 --> 49:46.330
I was thinking we could
all just have a little fun.

49:46.331 --> 49:47.157
Hold on.

49:47.158 --> 49:48.593
Fuck, you crazy bitch.

49:48.594 --> 49:49.507
That shit ain't even loaded.

49:49.508 --> 49:51.857
You want to test that theory?

49:51.858 --> 49:54.687
Oh, no, it's cool.

49:56.384 --> 49:58.124
We just had the wrong idea.

49:58.125 --> 50:00.606
Yeah, you bet your
chicken lickin' ass you did.

50:04.349 --> 50:05.653
What are you gonna
do, you gonna stab me?

50:05.654 --> 50:07.003
I guarantee you I'll
shoot your dick off

50:07.004 --> 50:08.005
before you get close.

50:10.746 --> 50:11.617
Put it away.

50:12.705 --> 50:14.314
Put that shit away.

50:14.315 --> 50:15.882
Yeah, listen to your friend.

50:18.015 --> 50:19.580
Now you assholes listen up.

50:19.581 --> 50:21.278
I got the night manager
watching my car all night.

50:21.279 --> 50:23.062
If either of you show
your faces here again,

50:23.063 --> 50:24.890
I will shoot your
dicks off so fast

50:24.891 --> 50:26.587
you won't even be able to blink.

50:26.588 --> 50:28.981
Am I clear?

50:28.982 --> 50:30.548
Yeah.

50:30.549 --> 50:31.419
Yeah, listen.

50:33.204 --> 50:35.074
Fuck it.

50:35.075 --> 50:36.467
Yeah, that's right, fuck it.

50:36.468 --> 50:37.555
LEVI: We gone.

50:37.556 --> 50:38.556
Yeah.

50:38.557 --> 50:39.383
Go on.

50:39.384 --> 50:40.211
Get the fuck out?

50:45.651 --> 50:47.566
Yeah, fuck you,
too, motherfucker.

50:51.222 --> 50:52.613
[laughs]

50:52.614 --> 50:54.398
You see him with that
little pussy ass knife?

50:54.399 --> 50:55.487
Fuckin' hell.

51:01.580 --> 51:02.537
You comin'?

51:04.148 --> 51:05.018
Yeah.

51:09.153 --> 51:12.243
[soft music playing]

51:27.301 --> 51:28.172
Feel better?

51:31.479 --> 51:32.480
Did that scare you?

51:33.916 --> 51:35.352
Did it scare me?

51:35.353 --> 51:36.962
I think I left a huge puddle
back in that parking lot.

51:36.963 --> 51:38.790
I'm sorry man,

51:38.791 --> 51:41.098
sometimes you gotta do what
you gotta do, you know?

51:43.448 --> 51:45.144
What if those guys come back?

51:45.145 --> 51:47.668
I mean you really didn't say
anything to the motel manager.

51:47.669 --> 51:49.975
Yeah, but they don't know that.

51:49.976 --> 51:52.109
Plus if they do,
they'll be sorry.

51:54.198 --> 51:56.329
Let's call Kyle, remember.

51:56.330 --> 51:58.331
I already tried him, no answer.

51:58.332 --> 52:02.161
Hmm, when I was in the
shower, why would you do that?

52:02.162 --> 52:03.642
Well call him back.

52:16.611 --> 52:17.437
No answer.

52:17.438 --> 52:18.309
Sorry.

52:19.484 --> 52:21.006
Well let me try.

52:21.007 --> 52:22.225
I just told you
there was no answer.

52:22.226 --> 52:23.487
Well just let me.

52:23.488 --> 52:24.358
No.

52:25.229 --> 52:26.143
Give it.

52:28.057 --> 52:29.101
Come on, what's the point?

52:29.102 --> 52:30.233
Raven, stop.

52:30.234 --> 52:31.190
I told you that
there was no answer -

52:31.191 --> 52:32.713
I want to talk to Kyle, please.

52:32.714 --> 52:33.627
Just give it to me.

52:33.628 --> 52:34.628
Are you kidding here?

52:34.629 --> 52:35.542
No.

52:35.543 --> 52:36.630
Just please let me call him.

52:36.631 --> 52:37.631
No.

52:37.632 --> 52:38.458
Please.

52:38.459 --> 52:39.504
Okay, go for it.

52:51.951 --> 52:53.039
Uh, that's weird.

52:54.171 --> 52:55.737
It's not going to his voicemail.

52:57.086 --> 52:59.436
Well, maybe you hit a
different number on the keypad.

52:59.437 --> 53:00.264
It happens.

53:06.879 --> 53:07.966
KYLE: This is Kyle Richards.

53:07.967 --> 53:09.359
Sorry I can't take
your call right now.

53:09.360 --> 53:10.577
If you know me,

53:10.578 --> 53:13.101
you know I'm busy saving
and preserving life.

53:13.102 --> 53:14.320
Please leave a message

53:14.321 --> 53:16.280
and I'll get back to you
just as soon as I can.

53:17.846 --> 53:18.934
Hi, baby, it's me.

53:20.545 --> 53:22.937
I guess you're working.

53:22.938 --> 53:25.940
Or I know you're working or
else you would have picked up.

53:25.941 --> 53:27.377
Or I would be waking you up

53:27.378 --> 53:29.728
which would be so rude
with you working so hard.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.688
Anyway, everything's going fine.

53:34.689 --> 53:37.214
For the most part.

53:38.563 --> 53:39.738
Nothing to worry about.

53:40.869 --> 53:42.523
I just wanted to
hear your voice.

53:45.134 --> 53:46.005
I miss you.

53:47.746 --> 53:48.616
I love you.

53:49.965 --> 53:50.836
Bye.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.104
Like I said, no answer.

54:01.934 --> 54:03.457
So I got his voicemail.

54:05.285 --> 54:06.764
Do you have his
number in there twice?

54:06.765 --> 54:07.896
Is one of them old?

54:09.942 --> 54:11.422
I don't know, maybe you
just hit the wrong button.

54:27.264 --> 54:31.311
[slow suspenseful music playing]

54:57.119 --> 54:58.119
It's bad.

54:58.120 --> 54:58.991
I'm sorry.

55:01.341 --> 55:02.994
We need to notify a supervisor

55:02.995 --> 55:04.692
and get detectives out here.

55:31.197 --> 55:32.371
Why did you do that last night?

55:32.372 --> 55:33.981
What?

55:33.982 --> 55:35.548
You know what.

55:35.549 --> 55:36.681
Save our asses?

55:37.769 --> 55:39.726
Get that guy to hit on me.

55:39.727 --> 55:41.337
Who does something like that?

55:41.338 --> 55:43.601
We were drunk, I was
just having a little fun.

55:44.732 --> 55:46.952
Is that what it was,
you were having fun?

55:48.867 --> 55:53.087
No, it, you want
me to be honest?

55:53.088 --> 55:56.875
Yeah, I do, I do, I
want you to be honest.

55:57.963 --> 55:59.007
I was testing you.

56:01.749 --> 56:04.272
Testing me, testing what?

56:04.273 --> 56:07.406
I wanted to see if you
were worthy of my brother.

56:07.407 --> 56:10.323
To see if you
really deserved him.

56:12.717 --> 56:14.892
I wanted to see
what you would do

56:14.893 --> 56:16.721
when some guy really wants you.

56:17.765 --> 56:19.158
I mean really wants you.

56:21.726 --> 56:23.248
I'm gonna have to make sure
you're not some dumb slut

56:23.249 --> 56:25.076
who gets drunk and gives
it up to the first guy

56:25.077 --> 56:26.730
that tells her she's pretty.

56:26.731 --> 56:28.949
Who's living in some
bullshit delusion

56:28.950 --> 56:31.736
that if she fucks some guy that
he actually cares about her.

56:34.478 --> 56:37.350
If you want me to be honest,
that's what I wanted to know.

56:40.048 --> 56:41.267
Don't worry, you passed.

56:45.663 --> 56:49.753
Now let's get the fuck out
of here because I'm famished.

56:49.754 --> 56:51.625
Want to get some
biscuits and gravy.

56:53.453 --> 56:55.760
You know, the kind of food that
really sticks to your ribs.

57:12.298 --> 57:13.473
Pretty good, huh?

57:17.042 --> 57:17.955
These out of the
way Podunk towns

57:17.956 --> 57:18.913
have the best fucking food.

57:20.219 --> 57:22.002
Better than sex.

57:22.003 --> 57:24.049
And it definitely
lasts longer at least.

57:26.530 --> 57:27.660
Is it good enough to pay for

57:27.661 --> 57:28.793
or are we gonna
dine and dash again?

57:30.185 --> 57:31.622
Oh, look at you, so funny.

57:33.101 --> 57:35.320
Well your sense of humor's
definitely improving,

57:35.321 --> 57:36.627
I gotta give you that one.

57:38.803 --> 57:41.196
I gotta piss, I'll
be right back.

58:01.129 --> 58:03.000
Just a little game we play.

58:23.369 --> 58:24.848
Not eating off the
floor now, are you?

58:24.849 --> 58:27.677
I mean this place is good
and everything, but...

58:27.678 --> 58:28.678
Uh, no.

58:28.679 --> 58:29.679
Good luck.

58:29.680 --> 58:30.550
Thought we could use it.

58:31.595 --> 58:32.551
You ready to go?

58:32.552 --> 58:33.987
Yeah, sure.

58:33.988 --> 58:34.814
Whenever you are.

58:34.815 --> 58:35.686
I got this.

lie down in the back.

put your seat back?

up here, I can't sleep.

highway 301 is?

it's around here someplace.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:08.473
Do you know where that is?

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:11.650
I'm sorry, I don't know
where no highway 301 is.

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:13.086
So you live around here

01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:15.175
and you have no idea
where highway 301 is?

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:16.655
MAN: I don't know
what you want me to say.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:17.700
I don't want you
to say anything.

01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:19.136
You know what I want you to do?

01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.398
I want you to go home and
fuck your mother some more,

01:00:20.399 --> 01:00:21.313
you fucking hick.

01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:29.626
[slow suspenseful music playing]

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.251
KYLE: Jessica.

01:01:31.252 --> 01:01:33.863
Jessica, where in
the hell are you?

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:34.995
Please call me back.

01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:39.085
My God, they found
her in her house.

01:01:39.086 --> 01:01:40.044
She's dead.

01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:43.700
She's dead.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.441
My sister is dead.

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:49.008
Please, please call me.

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:50.575
I don't know who in
the hell you're with,

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:52.099
but please call me.

01:01:53.144 --> 01:01:57.235
[slow suspenseful music playing]

01:02:08.159 --> 01:02:09.029
Sir!

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.074
Open the door!

01:02:11.075 --> 01:02:12.075
Hello!

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:13.250
Hello!

01:02:13.251 --> 01:02:14.121
Help me!

01:02:54.292 --> 01:02:55.293
You done sleeping?

01:02:57.338 --> 01:02:58.818
Can you take over for a while?

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:00.515
Sure.

01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:03.518
All right, scoot.

01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:08.479
Go on.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.307
Okay.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:16.488
[slow suspenseful music playing]

01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:26.149
You okay, you seem tense?

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:29.848
Yeah, um, I, I, I think
I got a kink in my neck

01:03:29.849 --> 01:03:31.502
or something from lying in back.

01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:33.157
See, I told you not to do that.

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.945
Just relax.

01:03:41.252 --> 01:03:42.340
Man, I can feel it.

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:46.431
See, we can just get all of
that tension right out of there.

01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:52.523
You know I forgot to tell you,

01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:53.786
I have great news,
I found your phone.

01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:57.441
You must have been in the
restroom or something,

01:03:57.442 --> 01:03:58.703
I don't know where
I found it, but.

01:03:58.704 --> 01:04:02.968
The funny thing is that
I put it in my purse.

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:05.231
And when I went
to give it to you,

01:04:05.232 --> 01:04:07.669
it wasn't there.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:10.411
Isn't that funny?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.458
I thought it was really funny.

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:16.547
[laughs]

01:04:16.548 --> 01:04:17.853
You want to know what I think

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.203
is really fucking
hilarious though?

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.423
That you are supposed
to be the smart girl,

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:24.643
psychology major.

01:04:25.992 --> 01:04:28.167
But it seems like I can
read you a whole lot better

01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:29.213
than you can read me.

01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:33.521
You know your poker
face is for shit, right?

01:04:39.005 --> 01:04:41.006
Oh no, no, don't
even think about it.

01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:41.878
See then,

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.837
you'd fuck up that pretty
little face of yours,

01:04:45.838 --> 01:04:47.143
and then you'd fuck up my car.

01:04:47.144 --> 01:04:48.885
And then where
would we be, right?

01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:54.367
So what now?

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.588
Well, we have two options.

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:00.069
You want to go and
see Kyle, right?

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:01.548
Make it back to New York?

01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:03.376
I was thinking

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:05.161
that we could all get together

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:07.120
and have a nice little chat.

01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:11.384
You know, like mature adults.

01:05:11.385 --> 01:05:12.604
Like how grown-ups do.

01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:16.215
So there's that or
there's the other option,

01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:18.610
but I really don't think that
you're gonna like that one.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.875
We still have a long ways to go.

01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.443
What, are we gonna play
hot seat some more?

01:05:29.186 --> 01:05:30.403
Wow.

01:05:30.404 --> 01:05:31.623
You got a set of
balls on you, girl.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.540
Okay, fine, how about this?

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:39.499
You can ask me any
question you like.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.632
Go ahead, shoot.

01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:45.419
What did you do?

01:05:48.422 --> 01:05:50.815
What did you do
to Kyle's sister?

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:54.166
Oh, I don't think that
you want to know about that.

01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:55.821
All the gory details.

01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:00.478
I wouldn't want to offend
your delicate sensibilities.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:02.306
Trust me.

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:08.399
Who are you then?

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:11.879
Who are you really, Jade?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.186
How do you know my name?

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:16.797
I asked you a fucking question!

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.452
How the fuck do
you know my name?

01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:26.677
Where did you get this?

01:06:26.678 --> 01:06:28.157
In between the seats.

01:06:28.158 --> 01:06:29.723
You must have dropped it.

01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:30.682
I must have.

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:33.031
Silly me.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:34.425
I'm always losing things.

01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:44.913
You know I, I always
hated this picture.

01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:48.613
But Kyle loved it.

01:06:51.964 --> 01:06:54.967
He said I was the most beautiful
woman in the entire world.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:07:00.537
He'd tell me all the time
while he was fucking me.

01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:01.930
How much he loved me.

01:07:04.455 --> 01:07:06.718
I knew him long before
you did, sweetie pie.

01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:09.329
I mean, how do you think we met?

01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:14.943
[slow suspenseful music playing]

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:33.135
Do you like to
shoot guns, Jessica?

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:35.007
I, I never really
liked them before.

01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:37.922
But I went to the firing range

01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:39.924
and popped off a couple shots,

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:41.752
and I have to say,

01:07:41.753 --> 01:07:42.623
it's pretty easy.

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:51.240
Not my favorite way
to kill people though.

01:07:51.241 --> 01:07:53.416
It's just too fast, you know,

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:54.896
it's just bang and
then you're dead.

01:07:56.246 --> 01:07:58.073
I'd much prefer

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.249
to really

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.294
get to know somebody, you know.

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:03.166
Find out

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:06.342
every little thing
about them, you know.

01:08:06.343 --> 01:08:09.302
Just really get to know
them, from the inside out.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.392
[laughs]

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.006
So Jess,

01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:21.096
big question.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:23.621
Do you like our little game?

01:08:24.926 --> 01:08:27.058
I feel like we're really
getting to know each other now.

01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:27.929
Don't you think?

01:08:29.366 --> 01:08:30.888
You know all about me.

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:34.848
I already know everything
about you to know.

01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:38.462
I've known girls like
you my entire life.

01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:40.506
The pretty girls,

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:42.334
the smart ones who, you know,

01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:43.988
everything was
just handed to you.

01:08:43.988 --> 01:08:46.383
Adored by daddy.

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:49.428
And all the boys
just come running

01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:52.649
as soon as you bat your
little fucking eyelashes.

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:54.868
I mean basically like
they're handing you

01:08:54.868 --> 01:08:55.827
their dicks on a platter.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.656
It's incredible though really.

01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:01.571
Ooh, what do you need, honey?

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:03.268
Can we do anything for you?

01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:06.010
Oh no, no, don't bother
yourself, I'll get it.

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:08.839
Oh, here, honey, let me
wipe your ass for you.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:09.841
Sound familiar?

01:09:11.015 --> 01:09:13.104
Am I on the right track?

01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:13.975
No.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.499
What was that, I couldn't hear.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.326
No, you're fucking not!

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:21.068
You don't know me.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:23.115
You don't know
anything about me.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.336
Adored by daddy?

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:30.035
Yeah, until he died
when I was ten.

01:09:31.341 --> 01:09:34.126
And let's just say mom couldn't
find a suitable replacement.

01:09:36.694 --> 01:09:39.435
But there were men around,
there were plenty of men.

01:09:41.264 --> 01:09:43.962
So don't sit there and
tell me I had it easy.

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:47.703
I mean you can do
anything you want,

01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.314
you have the fucking gun,

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:54.364
but don't think for a minute
you know anything about me.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:56.103
You're right, Jess.

01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:57.888
I do have the gun,

01:09:57.889 --> 01:09:58.759
which means

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:02.328
that we're gonna play
by my rules, okay.

01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:05.287
So you can sit
there all you want

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:06.897
and tell me about
your sad stories

01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.855
about how mommy was a
whore and daddy died,

01:10:08.856 --> 01:10:11.076
but the truth is I don't
really give a shit.

01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:16.908
Don't think about getting
brave on me, sweetie.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.302
As much as I'd like
to tear you open,

01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:23.349
I'll shoot you so fast you
won't know what hit you.

01:10:24.698 --> 01:10:26.569
Then you can't go home to Kyle.

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:29.355
Can't have that little chat
like grown-ups now, can we?

01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:31.748
So you're gonna be a good girl

01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:34.011
and listen to everything
I have to say.

01:10:34.012 --> 01:10:34.882
Got it?

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:39.364
I want to hear you say
that you understand.

01:10:39.365 --> 01:10:40.975
I understand.

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:43.282
That's a good girl.

01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:52.596
Stop the car.

01:10:53.597 --> 01:10:55.251
I said stop the fucking car.

01:11:00.517 --> 01:11:01.953
Now this is what we're gonna do.

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:04.824
I'm gonna let him in.

01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:05.782
And if you try anything

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:07.523
or I hear a word out of you,

01:11:07.524 --> 01:11:09.874
I'll shoot that tight little
pussy of yours off, okay.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.183
Get in!

01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:16.968
Let's go.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.190
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:26.803
Oh, you are angels, both of you.

01:11:26.804 --> 01:11:29.632
You wouldn't believe the
luck I'm having today.

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:31.373
You wouldn't believe it.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.810
It's like somebody put a voodoo
curse on me or something.

01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:35.333
That bad?

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:37.641
It couldn't be worse.

01:11:38.772 --> 01:11:40.077
What are you late for the prom?

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:42.209
My buddy's wedding.

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.690
I'm the best man.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.650
Well it looks like you
don't have the best car.

01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:49.216
Tell me about it.

01:11:49.217 --> 01:11:52.219
Anyway, two days ago my buddy
tells me he's getting married.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.004
Two days and he wants
me to be his best man.

01:11:54.005 --> 01:11:57.050
So where is the
blessed occasion?

01:11:57.051 --> 01:11:57.878
Hartford.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.098
I knew my transmission
was on the fritz.

01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.665
One wrong turn and then boom

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.188
I'm stuck out in the
middle of nowhere.
