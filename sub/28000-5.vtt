WEBVTT

00:09.342 --> 00:10.844
Ba-bum.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.263
[croaks]

00:14.597 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.142 --> 00:20.228
[Berto]  Previously on
The Dragon Prince... [squawks]

00:20.311 --> 00:23.648
So, the most important things,
I've written down.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.526
A letter?

00:28.987 --> 00:31.114
[Harrow] You'll understand in time.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.742
I want you to break the seal when...

00:34.909 --> 00:37.412
Well, you'll know when.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.081
I have done terrible things.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.792
I thought they were necessary.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.794
Now, I don't know.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.174
General Amaya reports
that Elvin forces are gathering

00:49.257 --> 00:51.301
on the Xadian side of the Breach.

00:51.384 --> 00:56.055
We must be prepared to fight,
and we won't be able to fight them alone.

00:58.683 --> 01:03.146
[gasps] The other four kingdoms
have agreed to a summit of the Pentarchy.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.107
I will rally the kings and queens
behind Katolis

01:06.191 --> 01:09.027
and finally destroy the Xadian threat!

01:10.278 --> 01:12.280
[theme music playing]

01:27.545 --> 01:28.963
[roaring]

01:53.238 --> 01:58.201
[guard] Halt! Dismount, disarm,
and proceed alone to the meeting point.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.837
-Welcome.
-How gracious.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.934
[indistinct chatter]

02:24.686 --> 02:26.563
[Ahling] You're the fourth to arrive.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.691
May I say,
on behalf of all of the kingdoms,

02:29.774 --> 02:33.444
we were deeply saddened
to hear of King Harrow's passing.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.489
Thank you, King Ahling. That means a lot.

02:36.573 --> 02:40.743
But we were reassured
when we received the scroll informing us

02:40.827 --> 02:45.498
that you would be the regent of Katolis
until Ezran comes of age.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.836
It is humbling to be trusted
with the boy's education and training,

02:49.919 --> 02:52.172
as well as decisions of state.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.715
And speaking of regents,

02:53.798 --> 02:55.758
it seems we are only waiting

02:55.842 --> 02:57.677
-on the regent of Duren?
-[footsteps]

02:58.261 --> 03:00.305
I apologize for my lateness.

03:00.388 --> 03:04.350
Queen Aanya of Duren. [chuckles]
How you've grown.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.560
Welcome.

03:06.311 --> 03:11.190
Hmm. We are here to discuss
some rather weighty matters.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.276
Will your regent be joining us soon?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.821
I speak for myself now, and for my people.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.949
Yes, this is a very serious situation.

03:20.033 --> 03:25.204
I intend no offense, but these issues
require an adult perspective.

03:25.288 --> 03:29.667
It seems I am a crown without an adult,
and you're an adult without a crown.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.668
Let's just begin.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.672
Very well.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.383
I called us here today...

03:38.718 --> 03:41.512
because I am afraid. Terrified.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.065
After centuries
of fighting amongst ourselves,

03:52.148 --> 03:57.987
the five human kingdoms
finally found a balance, an era of peace.

03:58.071 --> 04:02.200
But a new threat has arisen to challenge
all of humanity...

04:02.283 --> 04:04.494
a threat from Xadia.

04:11.834 --> 04:17.006
On the night of the full moon,
the Dragon Queen sent assassins...

04:20.176 --> 04:25.139
Moonshadow elves over the border,
and they murdered King Harrow.

04:26.975 --> 04:31.354
Now, Sunfire elves
are gathering near the border.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.773
An invasion is imminent.

04:33.856 --> 04:38.736
Even worse, there are reports
of shadows in the clouds. Dragons.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.821
[dragon roars]

04:39.904 --> 04:42.282
[Viren] Flying high
above the towns of Katolis.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.869
[roars]

04:48.162 --> 04:53.501
When I close my eyes,
I see fire raining down,

04:53.584 --> 04:57.255
death and destruction everywhere.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.382
It won't stop in Katolis.

04:59.465 --> 05:03.678
They will spread their wrath
to all the human kingdoms soon enough.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.598
The time to stop Xadia is now.

05:12.228 --> 05:16.774
We must stand together
to protect our common humanity.

05:17.358 --> 05:21.779
I call on you to join me, to join Katolis.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.867
Fight beside each other to drive back
this threat.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.878
[Bait snoring]

05:37.879 --> 05:38.880
[Ezran sighs]

05:40.173 --> 05:42.175
[vomiting and gasping]

05:43.634 --> 05:44.635
Ugh.

05:45.636 --> 05:50.266
[sniffing] Ah, yes, the smell of land.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.894
-[Rayla] Sweet, sweet land.
-[Ezran] Whoo-hoo!

05:52.977 --> 05:55.396
[Berto squawks] Let him finish.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.233
The faint, distant smell of land, that is.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.318
[Berto] There it is.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.402
[Rayla sighs]

06:04.238 --> 06:07.408
[Villads] About a full day of sailing
ahead until we reach the shore.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.369
Well, Zym, want to go count clouds again?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.706
[snoring]

06:14.457 --> 06:15.917
Or we could nap.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.304
[sighs]

06:32.767 --> 06:33.768
[exclaims]

06:41.651 --> 06:44.362
[Ahling] Lord Viren,
the people of Neolandia

06:44.445 --> 06:47.949
understand the common humanity
that binds us.

06:48.032 --> 06:51.119
If the other kingdoms
agree to act in unity,

06:51.202 --> 06:53.913
we will commit to this alliance.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.875
Yes. In unity,
you will have our support, as well.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.752
King Florian?

07:00.336 --> 07:04.549
If we are unanimous,
then the kingdom of Del Bar will join.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.301
Queen Aanya, what say you?

07:08.761 --> 07:11.514
I am... undecided.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.683
"Undecided"?

07:13.766 --> 07:16.561
Yes. It means I've yet to make up my mind.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.814
This is why we need an adult.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.276
A leader who can make strong choices
for their kingdom.

07:23.359 --> 07:26.279
Everyone else here
was capable of making a decision.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.782
I won't send my armies
to face unknown danger

07:29.866 --> 07:31.367
based on a two-minute speech.

07:32.034 --> 07:36.330
I may be a child, but apparently,
I'm the least impulsive of us all.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.749
Besides, I hardly call

07:38.833 --> 07:41.502
"we'll do what everyone else does"
a decision.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.922
[chuckles] Well, she's got a fair point.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.591
[sighs]

07:48.176 --> 07:51.762
Perhaps, I was rash in my words.
I apologize.

07:52.555 --> 07:58.019
You are a young queen,
but evidently far wiser than your years.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.315
As a child ruler,
I have had to survive adults

08:02.398 --> 08:08.237
trying to usurp my throne,
coups, conspiracies and assassinations.

08:08.321 --> 08:13.618
But sometimes, it's not the hard threats,
but the soft threats that are the worst.

08:13.701 --> 08:17.497
Sweet words can be more dangerous
than hidden daggers.

08:18.414 --> 08:22.585
[Ahling] My 19-year-old doesn't know
half the words you just said.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.505
And he still fights back
about eating his vegetables.

08:25.588 --> 08:31.177
[sighs] Queen Aanya, would you allow me
to share a story with you?

08:31.719 --> 08:37.058
A story of a time when our kingdoms
worked together to achieve something...

08:38.059 --> 08:38.893
miraculous.

08:42.313 --> 08:49.195
Nine years ago, my oldest friend,
Prince Harrow, became the king of Katolis.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.785
I remember the coronation
as if it were only yesterday.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.798
[crowd cheering]

09:11.384 --> 09:13.177
Whoo!

09:17.431 --> 09:19.517
I want to make a difference, Sarai.

09:20.309 --> 09:23.896
You will.
You'll be a champion of love and justice.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.773
And I'll be fighting by your side.

09:37.952 --> 09:41.372
[Viren]  He was a beautiful young king
with a beautiful family,

09:42.248 --> 09:44.834
and it was a time of hope in Katolis.

09:48.296 --> 09:52.091
Are we done yet?
It looks pretty done to me.

09:52.174 --> 09:56.178
[chuckles] Yes. It's beautiful.
An excellent likeness.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.513
You can all move now.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.223
[all exhaling]

10:00.224 --> 10:02.435
[Viren] No, hold on, you're not free yet.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.895
I'm afraid the king
has to pose for one more.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.232
-Ah, my official portrait.
-[baby coos]

10:08.316 --> 10:10.818
For history books and whatnot.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.905
[baby giggling]

10:14.989 --> 10:18.534
All right, ready?
Put on your best history face.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.829
Why don't you join me, Viren?

10:22.413 --> 10:25.416
But this is your official portrait
as king.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.086
Yes, and you should stand next to me,

10:29.170 --> 10:31.922
as I know you will stand by me
through anything.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.435
[baby crying]

10:48.481 --> 10:50.775
I brought you a surprise.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.944
[chuckles] Jelly tarts in bed?

10:54.403 --> 10:57.281
We are the king and queen now,
we can do whatever we want.

10:59.992 --> 11:00.868
[baby giggles]

11:04.246 --> 11:06.540
Ah, someone's inherited your sweet tooth.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.584
[both laugh]

11:11.587 --> 11:12.672
[baby yawns]

11:12.755 --> 11:16.300
Ezran is a lucky boy.
Born a prince, as I was.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.137
But there are so many in our kingdom
who were born with less.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.807
Harrow, what troubles you?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.892
Why do I deserve this?

11:24.975 --> 11:28.729
What did I do,
except being born with everything?

11:28.813 --> 11:32.691
You are humble, and grateful, and kind.

11:34.735 --> 11:39.448
Sarai, my father told me that above all,
I must be a just king.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.411
The night he died,
Lady Justice came to me in a dream.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.787
Lady Justice, huh?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.997
She was wearing her robes.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.625
Ugh, so a boring dream.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.961
-May I continue?
-Go on.

11:52.044 --> 11:56.757
She said to me that justice was more
than fair decisions and fair consequences.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.177
True justice was a fair system.

12:00.928 --> 12:05.516
Then she laid before me her scales,
her sword, and her blindfold...

12:06.267 --> 12:07.685
and told me to choose.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.353
You chose the blindfold.

12:10.062 --> 12:14.692
I did. She said the blindfold
gives us a way to test the system.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.112
That I should use it to imagine
I had not been born yet,

12:18.696 --> 12:21.824
and that I did not know
if I would be born rich or poor,

12:21.907 --> 12:23.576
what color my skin would be,

12:23.659 --> 12:26.996
what culture or practices
my family would have.

12:27.496 --> 12:31.125
That a fair system should be fair
no matter the accident of my birth.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.129
That the rights, and laws,
and opportunities within the system

12:35.212 --> 12:38.674
should stand to protect
and empower everyone.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.677
-Lady Justice is wise.
-Yes.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.305
And she didn't make any moves on you?

12:44.388 --> 12:47.600
-[chuckles] Wise enough to know better.
-[giggles]

12:48.184 --> 12:51.228
You're especially inspiring
when you say things like that

12:51.312 --> 12:53.481
with jelly smeared on your nose.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.565
What?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.737
[both laugh]

13:12.458 --> 13:14.835
[Viren]  King Harrow worked tirelessly.

13:14.919 --> 13:19.632
He told me he thought of himself
as a servant of all the people of Katolis.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.509
A servant king.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.974
But one day,
two visitors came from a faraway place,

13:29.058 --> 13:31.143
another kingdom, in fact.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.104
They desperately needed
King Harrow's help.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.191
Do you know
who these unexpected guests were?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.861
They were my parents.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.321
Yes.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.218
[both yawn]

14:11.684 --> 14:12.893
[croaks]

14:22.069 --> 14:23.070
[croaks]

14:24.864 --> 14:25.823
[croaks dejectedly]

14:35.291 --> 14:36.292
[door opens]

14:36.375 --> 14:39.962
Hey, can't a guy get a couple minutes
of below-deck privacy around here?

14:40.462 --> 14:42.464
I'm serious, leave me alone.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.594
[groans]

14:50.264 --> 14:53.142
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Why don't you join me down here?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.810
-[exclaims]
-I could use a little extra light.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.565
[croaks happily]

14:59.648 --> 15:05.070
[Viren]  Your parents, the queens of Duren,
carried themselves with great dignity,

15:05.613 --> 15:07.448
but there was pain in their eyes.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.784
No, please, you don't have to kneel.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.038
We are here to humble ourselves
and beg your help.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.499
The kingdom of Duren
has been suffering from a terrible famine

15:17.583 --> 15:19.335
for nearly seven years.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.879
Our food and resources are almost gone.

15:22.588 --> 15:28.510
This winter, we will run out of food
and a hundred thousand people will die.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.349
Then we will help you.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.103
The kingdom of Katolis will share
all that we have with the people of Duren.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.605
-[crowd murmurs]
-[gasps]

15:43.901 --> 15:46.987
My king, with respect, you spoke too soon.

15:47.071 --> 15:51.075
Katolis has barely enough food to sustain
its own people through the winter.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.328
There is not a handful of grain to spare.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.290
I won't turn my back on people in need.

15:58.374 --> 16:02.795
If you share with them,
a hundred thousand people will still die,

16:02.878 --> 16:06.006
but half of them
will be from our own kingdom.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.760
Then it seems we have no choice.

16:09.843 --> 16:13.222
Exactly. I'm sure they will understand.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.183
We will share whatever we have with them.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.895
And we will share in their suffering.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.572
[Viren]  Harrow had committed help
far beyond our means.

16:31.490 --> 16:36.370
That winter, starvation and death,
a devastating tragedy...

16:37.997 --> 16:39.581
would be inevitable.

16:41.417 --> 16:45.754
But a new possibility
presented itself to me.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.297
I have been doing research.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.008
Yes. I can see that.

16:51.301 --> 16:54.388
Poring over ancient texts,
maps and archives.

16:54.471 --> 16:58.976
And I may have found a creative solution.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.353
Something that could save lives.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.647
-Well, go on!
-Behold!

17:05.024 --> 17:06.400
It's a rock.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.863
This rock is, in fact,
a rare relic from Xadia.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.573
It's a piece of a great monster,

17:12.656 --> 17:15.117
a rocky giant
who lives high in the mountains.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.202
A Magma Titan.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.165
-[Harrow] It's warm.
-[Viren] Yes.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.293
Now, the titan lives
close to the border of Xadia.

17:24.376 --> 17:29.506
If we can hunt this monster and slay it,
I can use the heart of the titan

17:29.590 --> 17:32.342
in a powerful spell
that will warm the land,

17:32.426 --> 17:35.637
and allow us
to magically grow an incredible bounty.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.264
Enough to feed two kingdoms?

17:37.347 --> 17:40.517
-Enough to feed ten kingdoms.
-Hmm.

17:40.601 --> 17:45.939
[Viren]  Of course, at the time,
I was not the king's closest adviser.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.153
[Sarai grunts]

17:51.737 --> 17:53.322
It's a mistake, Harrow.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.699
Why do you have such a problem with this?

18:00.746 --> 18:02.498
[Sarai grunting]

18:03.082 --> 18:06.001
We kill one monster
to save a hundred thousand people.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.171
-You keep calling it a monster.
-Yes.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.633
It's a giant beast made of rock and magma.
I call that a monster.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.134
[both grunting]

18:19.598 --> 18:20.474
Is it intelligent?

18:20.557 --> 18:22.559
What? What do you mean?

18:23.268 --> 18:26.855
Does it think? Does it feel?
Does it have a family?

18:27.815 --> 18:31.193
[grunts] I sincerely doubt
it has a family.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.445
Then is it the last of its kind?

18:34.029 --> 18:35.989
Why does any of that matter?

18:37.574 --> 18:40.119
I know it seems
like this will solve things,

18:40.202 --> 18:42.663
but isn't it a little too easy?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.665
That's always the way with dark magic.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.875
What choice do we have?

18:48.001 --> 18:50.129
[Sarai grunting]

18:52.381 --> 18:56.260
You said you want to build a better world,
to really change things,

18:56.343 --> 18:58.846
but that's going to take
decades of hard work.

18:58.929 --> 19:02.307
There's no monster you can slay
and solve all your problems.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.809
There's no shortcut.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.981
This is going to be a very slippery slope!

19:09.064 --> 19:10.566
-[Harrow grunts]
-[Sarai sighs]

19:10.649 --> 19:13.193
Harrow, tell me you won't do this.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.322
It's our only chance.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.241
[Sarai sighs]

19:19.992 --> 19:21.076
[Harrow sighs]

19:23.537 --> 19:24.538
[ligtning cracks]

19:26.123 --> 19:27.583
[horses neigh]

19:28.375 --> 19:31.962
We will enter Xadia through the Breach.
There we can pick up supplies and...

19:36.425 --> 19:38.635
-I'm here.
-Queen Sarai.

19:42.472 --> 19:45.225
-I thought you disapproved.
-I disagree.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.562
But I stand by you anyway.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.272
Thank you.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.816
I think this was
in our marriage vows, right?

19:52.900 --> 19:57.196
Something about keeping you alive
when you're acting like a brave idiot?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.448
[thunder rumbling]

19:59.531 --> 20:00.532
[Sarai] Come on.

20:06.121 --> 20:09.333
[Viren]  We traveled as quickly as we could
to the border.

20:09.416 --> 20:13.962
Bold adventurers from two kingdoms
crossed the Breach together,

20:14.046 --> 20:17.132
hoping to find a way to help their people.

20:20.135 --> 20:24.389
[Harrow] Thunder, the King of the Dragons,
patrols the skies from dawn until dusk.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.600
So, we will enter Xadia at sundown,

20:27.392 --> 20:29.311
and we must return
with the heart of the titan

20:29.394 --> 20:31.730
before the first moments
of the sun's rise.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.733
[Neha] Will these ballistas be able to
take down a Magma Titan?

20:34.816 --> 20:38.320
If our aim is true,
we'll find the right spot

20:38.403 --> 20:39.488
and get the job done.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.120
-[laughs]
-What?

20:47.704 --> 20:49.206
[clears throat] Nothing.

21:07.015 --> 21:11.353
[Viren]  We emerged into darkness
and quickly got to work.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.242
[chanting]

21:31.248 --> 21:34.209
[chanting]

21:37.170 --> 21:39.715
Let's go. The night is short.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.596
[Viren]  With each step further into Xadia,

21:46.680 --> 21:50.017
my heart beat louder
with excitement and fear.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.645
This place held
both the promise of our salvation,

21:53.729 --> 21:56.023
and the threat of our destruction.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.869
We were ready for the fight of our lives.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.961
We found the titan,
but it wasn't what we expected.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.755
[crow caws]

22:19.838 --> 22:22.966
[Neha] It's dead. What do we do now?

22:23.050 --> 22:25.135
[Viren] Don't sound so disappointed.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.095
If it's dead, we don't need to kill it.

22:27.179 --> 22:30.599
We just open it up and take what we need.

22:57.334 --> 23:01.296
I've had his letter for a few days now,
but I just can't bring myself to open it.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.882
I don't know. I know it sounds crazy,

23:03.965 --> 23:07.719
but it's like, right now there are words
he hasn't said to me,

23:07.803 --> 23:12.015
and they're all right in there.
They're just waiting to come to life.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.351
But then once I read it...

23:15.811 --> 23:17.479
once I read the last word...

23:18.522 --> 23:20.107
then he'll really be gone.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.150
Forever.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.195
[croaking sympathetically]

23:25.779 --> 23:28.907
[exhales] Okay. Thanks, Bait.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.732
[horses neighing]

24:06.695 --> 24:08.697
[roaring]
