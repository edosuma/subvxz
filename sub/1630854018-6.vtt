WEBVTT

00:06.666 --> 00:09.291
Summon the legions. It is time.

00:09.666 --> 00:11.458
Our enemy vows to attack.

00:11.541 --> 00:14.541
Who among you will stand and fight?

00:14.625 --> 00:15.833
You will die.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.250
Long have I awaited this day.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.375
I pledge my loyalty to Sauron.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.583
Half of us just left.

00:23.666 --> 00:25.041
But half stayed.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.000
Why wasn't I chosen
for the expedition?

00:27.083 --> 00:28.666
Thought you were going west.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.916
Not till I've done something
worthy of Númenor.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.916
I have just convinced Númenor
to send five ships

00:34.000 --> 00:36.666
and 500 men to aid your people

00:36.791 --> 00:38.500
and place a crown upon your head.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.583
You are asking me to go to the one place
that I swore never to return.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.666
Why do you keep fighting?

00:43.750 --> 00:45.375
Because I cannot stop.

00:45.958 --> 00:49.250
Come with me, and together we will
redeem both our bloodlines.

00:50.916 --> 00:52.250
We head nor'-east.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.041
-For Middle-earth.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.791
It is no sword. It is a power.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.250
Have you heard of Sauron?

01:02.666 --> 01:03.958
I've seen this before.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.500
It is a key.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.583
The enemy commander spoke of
giving the Orcs a home in these lands.

01:09.708 --> 01:11.833
Whatever his design, this much is certain.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.333
Our enemy knows your son
has what he needs to enact it.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.375
How long?

01:18.458 --> 01:19.458
Maybe hours.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.583
New life.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.000
In defiance of death.

03:50.791 --> 03:52.083
My children,

03:53.916 --> 03:56.625
we have endured much.

03:59.916 --> 04:04.291
We cast off our shackles.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.958
Crossed mountain, field,

04:11.000 --> 04:12.666
frost, and fallow

04:13.291 --> 04:15.250
till our feet bloodied the dirt.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.666
From  Ered Mithrin  to the  Ephel Arnen,

04:24.875 --> 04:26.291
we have endured.

04:30.625 --> 04:35.416
Yet tonight, one more trial awaits us.

04:37.166 --> 04:41.583
Our enemy may be weak,
their numbers meager...

04:43.750 --> 04:48.500
...yet before this night is through,
some of us will fall.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.833
But for the first time, you do so

04:53.708 --> 04:58.083
not as unnamed slaves in far-away lands,

04:58.166 --> 04:59.583
but as brothers.

05:01.416 --> 05:04.458
As brothers and sisters in our home!

05:08.208 --> 05:09.583
Nampat.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.958
Nampat! Nampat!

05:12.041 --> 05:13.416
This is the night

05:13.500 --> 05:17.041
-we reach out the iron hand of the  Uruk...
-Nampat! Nampat!

05:17.125 --> 05:19.750
...and close our fist around these lands.

05:19.833 --> 05:21.500
-Nampat!

05:23.791 --> 05:25.000
Nampat!

05:28.083 --> 05:29.208
Nampat!

05:31.875 --> 05:33.166
Nampat!

06:09.416 --> 06:10.791
Search it.

06:11.166 --> 06:17.166
All of you! Fan out! Find them!

07:01.000 --> 07:04.208
Meaning no offense,
Lord-father, but where is he?

07:05.291 --> 07:06.958
What happened to Sauron?

07:10.041 --> 07:13.875
Can't find tooth nor tail of him.
Must've got smart and scarpered.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.250
No. The Elf's here.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.833
I smell him.

07:20.916 --> 07:22.000
Yes, Father.

07:22.625 --> 07:23.750
Up here!

07:29.541 --> 07:31.208
Bring him down!

07:47.208 --> 07:48.500
Get out, now!

08:03.208 --> 08:04.375
Open that door!

08:11.958 --> 08:13.208
Get out!

08:16.125 --> 08:18.541
Lord-father! You must move now!

08:18.625 --> 08:20.416
You must move!

08:37.666 --> 08:39.916
How many of 'em
could have survived that?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.458
How long do we have?

08:43.291 --> 08:44.500
Not long enough.

08:45.208 --> 08:48.041
Come on,
we have to make ready the village.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.750
Easy, Berek. Easy, boy.

09:50.125 --> 09:50.958
Hoist it up!

10:04.416 --> 10:06.833
I thought all soldiers
were to be abed.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.875
Pardon me, Commander. I... I was only...

10:08.958 --> 10:11.291
Hoping to get the first sight of land?

10:12.208 --> 10:13.375
At ease.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.458
It'll be visible to your eyes
in a few moments.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.708
Is it visible to yours already?

10:22.083 --> 10:23.750
Has been for nearly an hour.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.833
Keen are the eyes of the Elves.

10:26.916 --> 10:30.166
And yet, mine have not before seen you.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.208
Swinging steel nor flying sail.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.750
What is your rank?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.416
Stable sweep.

10:41.916 --> 10:44.916
Despise not the labor
which humbles the heart.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.791
Humility has saved entire kingdoms
the proud have all but led to ruin.

10:49.333 --> 10:52.916
I did not join this expedition
to be humbled, Commander.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.750
Then for what did you join, soldier?

10:55.625 --> 10:57.458
I was just trying to get away.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.625
As far as I could from that place.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.875
Númenor?

11:02.875 --> 11:04.458
It's not Númenor.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.083
Not the real Númenor, anyway.

11:07.791 --> 11:09.208
If it ever existed.

11:09.291 --> 11:10.875
It existed.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.083
It exists still...

11:14.166 --> 11:16.791
If only in the heart
of the lowliest stable sweep.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.208
It's Isildur.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.708
I might have known.

11:24.041 --> 11:26.041
You have the look of your father.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.541
I was always told I look
more like my mother.

11:49.541 --> 11:50.708
Soldier.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.000
Captain.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.000
His mother...

12:08.375 --> 12:09.791
What happened to her?

12:14.750 --> 12:16.166
It is strange.

12:18.166 --> 12:22.250
Most of my life, I've looked east
to see the Sun rise over the sea.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.958
And west to see it set over the land.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.541
We're sailing into the dawn,
and yet, to me,

12:30.291 --> 12:32.291
it feels like the coming of night.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.166
She drowned.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.291
Land has been sighted,
Your Majesty.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.083
How long before we make anchor?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.416
It's a full day's sail
into the mountains.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.958
And from there, another day's ride
east into the vale.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.041
Signal the other ships.

13:08.125 --> 13:10.375
Tell them to make all possible haste.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.375
It is beyond our skill to destroy.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.125
Where will you hide it?

14:05.916 --> 14:07.458
No one must know.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.500
Not even you.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.333
Our enemy has been sighted.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.083
We survived them before.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.458
Now we must do so again.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.000
Tonight.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.250
Our position gives us an advantage.

14:46.666 --> 14:50.500
But to use it,
we must draw the enemy in close.

14:53.416 --> 14:55.500
We must wait until every last Orc

14:55.583 --> 14:58.083
has crossed that bridge
to spring our attack.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.041
This will test your nerve.

15:03.750 --> 15:04.958
Let it.

15:06.375 --> 15:09.875
All who cannot fight
will be barricaded inside.

15:09.958 --> 15:13.000
This is to be our keep.
Our fallback point.

15:13.916 --> 15:16.916
-Take heart. All of you.

15:18.708 --> 15:22.625
I have seen smaller armies
defeat greater foes.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.416
Soon, the sun will set.

15:25.833 --> 15:30.666
Do your part, and I swear to you,
you shall see it rise again.

15:31.875 --> 15:34.000
-Do you believe it?
-Aye.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.625
-Do you believe it?
-Aye!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.416
To your positions.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.250
What about me?

15:48.958 --> 15:50.041
Tavern.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.458
Tavern's for wounded and children.
I can fight.

15:52.541 --> 15:54.041
I know you can.

15:54.125 --> 15:56.583
Which is why I need you in there,
protecting those who cannot.

16:04.666 --> 16:05.750
Come.

16:11.291 --> 16:15.500
Remember when I was little...
When I used to have bad dreams?

16:16.708 --> 16:17.875
I remember.

16:19.125 --> 16:21.125
You remember what you used to say?

16:22.500 --> 16:24.583
When you would hold me in the dark?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.875
Would you say it to me now?

16:32.875 --> 16:37.958
"In the end, this shadow
is but a small and passing thing.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.916
"There is light and high beauty

16:45.041 --> 16:47.041
"forever beyond its reach.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.541
"Find the light...

16:51.500 --> 16:53.875
"And the shadow will not find you."

17:05.208 --> 17:06.500
Farewell, Mother.

17:27.458 --> 17:28.875
Are you ready?

17:30.083 --> 17:33.500
No. Are you?

17:49.208 --> 17:50.708
The  alfirin  seeds...

17:54.666 --> 17:57.041
It is a tradition among Elves.

17:57.125 --> 18:00.541
Before the battle begins, plant one.

18:05.833 --> 18:09.458
New life, in defiance of death?

18:28.250 --> 18:31.875
It is believed that one of the Valar

18:34.333 --> 18:36.708
watches over growing things...

18:45.208 --> 18:46.791
And those who tend them.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.791
The rest...

18:57.041 --> 18:59.416
we shall plant after the battle is over.

19:02.916 --> 19:04.333
In a new garden.

19:07.041 --> 19:08.375
You and I.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.166
And Theo.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.875
Together.

19:17.625 --> 19:18.875
Promise me.

21:07.541 --> 21:09.583
-They're here.

21:09.666 --> 21:10.875
Oh, dear...

23:13.583 --> 23:16.333
The bleeding fools missed us.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.958
Come on!

23:50.750 --> 23:51.875
They're headed for the tavern.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.708
-Fight for the Southlands!
-Fight for the Southlands!

27:21.208 --> 27:22.708
The land is ours!

27:32.250 --> 27:35.666
More than a bit brave, Elf.
More than a bit.

28:19.375 --> 28:20.541
Bronwyn.

29:10.500 --> 29:13.041
We were fighting our own.

29:16.541 --> 29:20.250
Thought we'd take 'em in
for nothin'?

29:21.291 --> 29:23.125
Had to pay the toll...

29:25.416 --> 29:29.458
And now, all of you will.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.000
Tredwill!

30:12.750 --> 30:13.916
Mother!

30:16.583 --> 30:19.000
Everyone, to the keep!

30:21.208 --> 30:22.833
Go! Go!

30:24.000 --> 30:25.375
Into the tavern!

30:34.375 --> 30:35.208
The tavern!

30:36.625 --> 30:38.125
All of you!

30:41.750 --> 30:42.583
Go!

30:51.208 --> 30:52.541
-The table!

30:52.625 --> 30:55.291
-Hurry!

31:09.916 --> 31:11.333
-Hurry!

31:14.000 --> 31:15.583
-Mother. Mother.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.041
Help him first.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.625
No.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.250
We will help you.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.083
Mother.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.416
Theo...

31:41.541 --> 31:43.541
You'll have to stem the bleeding.

31:43.625 --> 31:44.833
I... I don't think I...

31:44.916 --> 31:48.083
Either you're gonna do this
or I'm gonna die. Do you understand?

31:50.875 --> 31:52.166
Theo.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.375
Mother, prepare yourself.

32:10.125 --> 32:11.250
I am sorry.

32:23.958 --> 32:25.583
Put pressure on the wound.

32:41.958 --> 32:42.791
Burn...

32:43.875 --> 32:46.416
She's cold.
She's lost too much blood.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.083
No. No. No.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.666
She's saying "burn."

32:50.083 --> 32:53.041
The  alfirin  seeds.
We have to seal the wound with fire.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.708
Bring me some burning wood. Hurry!

33:04.750 --> 33:05.958
Now.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.125
Now.

33:16.791 --> 33:17.958
Now this side.

33:23.125 --> 33:24.208
Go on.

33:30.541 --> 33:31.541
That's enough.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
Bronwyn?

33:47.916 --> 33:49.666
-Mother?
-Bronwyn?

33:49.750 --> 33:51.958
Wake up! Mother!

34:25.291 --> 34:27.166
-Nampat!

34:27.500 --> 34:30.083
-Nampat!

34:30.166 --> 34:31.250
Nampat!

34:32.916 --> 34:34.000
Nampat!

34:35.458 --> 34:36.541
Nampat!

34:37.958 --> 34:39.291
Nampat!

34:40.375 --> 34:41.458
Nampat!

34:42.166 --> 34:44.166
-Kick 'em in the back!
-Nampat!

34:45.583 --> 34:46.625
Nampat!

34:48.166 --> 34:49.166
Nampat!

34:50.833 --> 34:51.875
Nampat!

35:53.250 --> 35:54.208
-Sit down!

36:31.416 --> 36:34.083
What I seek.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.833
Give it to me.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.583
Let them go.

36:41.541 --> 36:42.875
I will consider it.

36:55.583 --> 37:00.125
Why sacrifice
their lives for such a little thing?

37:21.416 --> 37:22.833
The woman next.

37:24.291 --> 37:25.375
No!

37:31.041 --> 37:32.208
-Wait!
-Theo!

37:34.333 --> 37:35.375
It's under here.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.166
It's under here.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.541
No.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.500
Theo!

37:58.000 --> 37:59.083
I'm sorry.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.875
Waldreg, I have a task for you.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.875
They all must die.

40:18.458 --> 40:19.500
Ontamo!

40:48.458 --> 40:49.375
Go.

40:50.416 --> 40:51.416
Hyah!

41:01.875 --> 41:02.916
Hyah!

41:17.208 --> 41:18.458
Father!

41:28.541 --> 41:30.041
Father!

41:30.125 --> 41:32.166
-I'm all right.
-I thought you...

41:33.250 --> 41:34.666
I'm all right, Isil.

41:40.583 --> 41:42.166
Soldier.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.250
Their commander?

41:47.625 --> 41:49.041
The item he possesses...

41:49.125 --> 41:50.875
He must not escape with it.

42:00.583 --> 42:01.750
Who is that?

42:05.416 --> 42:07.041
Commander
of the Northern Armies.

42:07.416 --> 42:09.375
Galadriel.

42:48.291 --> 42:50.875
Noro lim!

43:19.875 --> 43:20.958
Go!

44:00.333 --> 44:01.750
You remember me?

44:08.500 --> 44:09.500
No.

44:23.458 --> 44:24.500
Stop!

44:26.000 --> 44:27.333
We need him alive.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.500
I need him alive.

44:30.666 --> 44:32.291
You don't know what he did.

44:35.583 --> 44:41.458
Did I cause someone you love pain?

44:45.541 --> 44:46.791
A woman?

44:50.041 --> 44:54.250
Perhaps a child?

44:54.333 --> 44:55.916
Eat your tongue.

44:58.333 --> 45:01.333
Halbrand, put it down.

45:06.166 --> 45:09.166
One cannot satisfy thirst
by drinking sea water.

45:27.708 --> 45:29.041
So, what do you think?

45:33.375 --> 45:34.625
I like the mountains.

45:36.083 --> 45:38.583
You're about to get a closer look at them.

45:39.541 --> 45:41.958
Commander Galadriel's
putting together a company

45:42.041 --> 45:44.041
to track down the Orcs that escaped,

45:44.125 --> 45:46.666
and I managed to wheedle
the pair of us a spot.

45:46.750 --> 45:47.875
What about Ontamo?

45:48.000 --> 45:51.458
I think I might stay here for a while.
Lend these folk a hand.

45:51.541 --> 45:55.416
-Seen enough battle for a week?
-More like a whole lifetime.

45:59.250 --> 46:01.833
This company, when's it set out?

46:02.708 --> 46:05.708
Don't know for certain.
Not till she's done with him.

46:10.541 --> 46:15.541
When I was a child, I heard stories
of Elves taken by Morgoth.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.833
Tortured. Twisted.

46:21.875 --> 46:24.541
Made into a new and ruined form of life.

46:26.583 --> 46:29.000
You are one of them, are you not?

46:30.750 --> 46:32.333
The Moriondor.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.583
The Sons of the Dark.

46:36.833 --> 46:38.875
The first Orcs.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.708
Uruk.

46:45.041 --> 46:46.458
We prefer  "Uruk."

46:46.541 --> 46:50.000
Even Moriondor take orders from a master.

46:50.083 --> 46:51.875
And I seek yours.

46:52.625 --> 46:53.708
Where is he?

46:54.916 --> 46:56.250
Where is Sauron?

47:06.083 --> 47:09.041
Perhaps we should bring our prisoners
into the sunlight.

47:17.541 --> 47:19.750
After Morgoth's defeat,

47:21.500 --> 47:24.750
the one you call Sauron...

47:27.791 --> 47:31.583
Devoted himself to healing Middle-earth,

47:33.750 --> 47:38.458
bringing its ruined lands together
in perfect order.

47:41.833 --> 47:43.833
He sought to craft a power

47:46.708 --> 47:48.375
not of the flesh...

47:50.833 --> 47:52.416
But over flesh.

47:53.708 --> 47:56.125
A power of the Unseen World.

48:00.166 --> 48:03.166
He bid as many as he could
to follow him far north.

48:04.916 --> 48:07.916
But try as he might...

48:10.000 --> 48:11.416
Something was missing.

48:18.541 --> 48:22.041
A shadow of dark knowledge

48:23.125 --> 48:27.375
that kept itself hidden, even from him.

48:31.375 --> 48:34.958
No matter how much blood
he spilt in its pursuit.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.083
Mmm. For my part...

48:44.583 --> 48:49.666
I sacrificed enough
of my children for his aspirations.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.166
I split him open.

48:58.041 --> 49:00.291
I killed Sauron.

49:00.791 --> 49:02.208
I do not believe you.

49:07.083 --> 49:10.708
You cannot believe an  Uruk  could do that

49:12.291 --> 49:14.458
which your entire army could not.

49:14.875 --> 49:18.875
I cannot believe
that you are this army's only master.

49:18.958 --> 49:21.166
My children have no master.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.541
They are not children, they are slaves.

49:23.625 --> 49:25.541
But each one has a name. A heart.

49:27.250 --> 49:28.291
A heart.

49:28.375 --> 49:31.583
-A heart created by Morgoth.
-We are creations of The One,

49:31.666 --> 49:34.416
Master of the Secret Fire,
the same as you.

49:34.958 --> 49:37.708
As worthy of the breath of life,

49:39.333 --> 49:41.083
and just as worthy of a home.

49:45.166 --> 49:46.250
Soon...

49:48.708 --> 49:51.958
This land will be ours.
Then, you will understand.

49:58.875 --> 49:59.875
No.

50:02.291 --> 50:04.125
Your kind was a mistake.

50:05.833 --> 50:07.250
Made in mockery.

50:09.291 --> 50:14.875
And even if it takes me all of this Age,
I vow to eradicate every last one of you.

50:17.458 --> 50:21.333
But you shall be kept alive,

50:22.250 --> 50:23.875
so that one day,

50:23.958 --> 50:26.875
before I drive my dagger
into your poisoned heart,

50:28.166 --> 50:31.166
I will whisper in your piked ear

50:31.250 --> 50:33.958
that all your offspring are dead

50:35.083 --> 50:38.083
and the scourge of your kind
ends with you.

50:43.041 --> 50:46.416
It would seem I'm not the only Elf alive

50:46.500 --> 50:49.500
who has been transformed by darkness.

50:51.791 --> 50:54.291
Perhaps your search
for Morgoth's successor

50:54.375 --> 50:56.625
should have ended in your own mirror.

50:56.708 --> 51:01.416
Perhaps I shall begin by killing you,
you slavering Orc.

51:01.500 --> 51:02.666
Galadriel.

51:08.583 --> 51:09.666
Uruk.

51:37.375 --> 51:38.583
Who are you?

52:18.125 --> 52:19.416
Thank you...

52:21.166 --> 52:22.583
For pulling me back.

52:25.791 --> 52:27.625
Was you, pulled me back first.

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
Whatever it was he did to you,

52:35.875 --> 52:37.875
and whatever it was you did...

52:41.583 --> 52:43.250
Be free of it.

52:46.666 --> 52:48.666
I never believed I could be...

52:55.083 --> 52:56.500
Until today.

53:01.958 --> 53:04.083
Fighting at your side, I...

53:06.291 --> 53:07.541
I felt...

53:10.250 --> 53:12.666
If I could just hold on to that feeling,

53:14.125 --> 53:16.250
keep it with me always,

53:18.041 --> 53:22.625
bind it to my very being, then I...

53:26.541 --> 53:27.958
I felt it, too.

53:40.666 --> 53:43.000
-Lord Halbrand.

53:43.083 --> 53:45.083
The Queen Regent wishes to see you.

54:41.916 --> 54:42.875
Queen Regent.

54:48.416 --> 54:52.916
What I owe you...
My people are alive because of you.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.416
As I understand it,
they're alive because of you.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.083
A burden I never sought to take up.

55:01.833 --> 55:03.833
Few of the finest leaders do.

55:09.041 --> 55:12.500
But if you would like some relief
in carrying it,

55:13.708 --> 55:15.375
I may be able to help.

55:16.666 --> 55:18.666
You called for me, Your Majesty?

55:19.916 --> 55:21.166
Bronwyn...

55:22.583 --> 55:24.416
This is Lord Halbrand.

55:36.958 --> 55:38.125
Bronwyn.

55:40.250 --> 55:44.666
Is it true?
Are you the king we were promised?

55:55.666 --> 55:56.750
Yes.

56:02.208 --> 56:03.291
All hail!

56:04.375 --> 56:09.250
All hail to the true
King of the Southlands!

56:09.333 --> 56:13.791
All hail
to the true King of the Southlands!

56:13.875 --> 56:17.750
All hail to the true
King of the Southlands!

56:22.916 --> 56:26.083
The men of these lands
have awaited this moment a long time.

56:26.875 --> 56:29.083
Not nearly so long as the Elves.

57:04.833 --> 57:06.333
Do not torment yourself.

57:11.291 --> 57:13.875
Many might have done the same
in your place.

57:20.708 --> 57:22.291
You don't understand.

57:24.958 --> 57:28.166
It's not just guilt I feel.

57:31.833 --> 57:33.250
It's loss.

57:35.916 --> 57:37.083
Loss?

57:42.250 --> 57:44.083
When it was in my hands,

57:46.375 --> 57:47.541
I felt...

57:51.708 --> 57:52.958
Powerful.

57:57.083 --> 57:58.833
Then rid yourself of it.

58:01.083 --> 58:02.583
Once and for all.

58:03.208 --> 58:04.375
How?

58:07.333 --> 58:08.666
Give it to Númenor.

58:09.708 --> 58:12.208
To toss into the sea on their voyage home.

59:44.708 --> 59:47.416
-Easy. Berek, easy.

59:48.250 --> 59:51.041
It's just a scratch. You're okay.

59:51.125 --> 59:53.750
Hey, hey, hey. Berek.

59:54.625 --> 59:56.625
-Careful.

59:58.208 --> 59:59.333
Athae...

1:00:02.208 --> 1:00:03.750
no ídhui hí.

1:00:08.250 --> 1:00:09.708
How did you do that?

1:00:09.791 --> 1:00:12.000
It's not his pain that's bothering him...

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:14.833
But that of his rider.

1:00:14.916 --> 1:00:17.875
-I'm not in pain.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.666
When a horse of Westernesse
rides into battle,

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:27.291
he forms an unbreakable bond
with the soldier he bears.

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:30.250
In time, they become as one.

1:00:30.333 --> 1:00:33.958
Even knowing the innermost feelings
of each other's heart.

1:00:34.041 --> 1:00:36.666
-You know his feelings?
-No.

1:00:37.625 --> 1:00:38.791
He knows yours.

1:00:42.291 --> 1:00:44.041
Where did you learn all this?

1:00:46.583 --> 1:00:48.000
From your mother.

1:00:57.583 --> 1:00:59.083
Think you could teach me?

1:01:38.125 --> 1:01:40.333
Udûn...

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:43.625
Udûn. Udûn.

1:03:26.125 --> 1:03:27.208
Take shelter!

1:03:30.875 --> 1:03:31.875
The Queen!

1:03:36.875 --> 1:03:37.875
Berek!

1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:41.958
Valandil!

1:04:04.708 --> 1:04:05.916
Over the wall!

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.375
-Theo!
-Theo!
