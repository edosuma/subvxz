WEBVTT

01:08.329 --> 01:09.330
Shit!

01:37.358 --> 01:38.750
It's a punching bag!

02:31.890 --> 02:33.414
What
constitutes a threat?

02:39.985 --> 02:40.769
Is it a person?

02:46.122 --> 02:47.602
Is it a weapon?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.743
The person holding the weapon?

03:26.336 --> 03:28.295
Bigger the weapon, the
bigger the threat, right?

03:28.382 --> 03:29.209
Right.

03:30.514 --> 03:31.907
Wrong.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.039
Threat boils down to intent.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.303
Reading that intent is how
you keep yourself safe.

03:37.608 --> 03:38.783
And the most important
intent, of course,

03:38.870 --> 03:40.089
is your own.

03:43.092 --> 03:45.181
What do you intend
for yourselves?

03:45.268 --> 03:46.269
Gimme a break.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.100
Problem solving
isn't about fighting,

03:51.187 --> 03:52.057
it's about diffusing.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.364
Someone wants my money,

03:54.451 --> 03:56.018
chances are that's
all they want.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.193
What are you saying,

03:57.280 --> 03:58.238
you just hand them your money?

03:59.195 --> 04:00.718
That's right.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.459
Yeah, I'm not about that.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.156
I'm not gonna just let
someone take what's mine.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.420
Oh, you keep all your
money in your wallet, Kyle?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.727
Your bank account will survive

04:09.814 --> 04:11.642
but only if you do.

04:11.729 --> 04:12.904
Come on, man, I thought
this was advanced techniques,

04:12.991 --> 04:14.645
not Eastern philosophy.

04:14.732 --> 04:15.255
It's both.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.954
Ah, whatever, I
want my money back.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.044
Sure.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.437
Can handle that after class.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.916
No, we can handle
it right now,

04:25.003 --> 04:26.483
'cause you wasted
enough of my time.

04:29.704 --> 04:30.531
Okay.

04:41.933 --> 04:42.804
Fuck this.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.114
Obviously, not all
interactions can be solved

04:49.201 --> 04:50.855
with pacifism and refunds.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.424
So for the ones
that turn violent,

04:54.511 --> 04:56.383
well, you wanna know how
to defend yourselves.

05:16.925 --> 05:17.926
I remember when
that was taken.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.806
Something wrong with trying to
cultivate a little nostalgia?

05:28.893 --> 05:29.677
Guess not.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.335
It's good to see you.

05:36.771 --> 05:37.598
Same here.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.949
What can I do for
you, Lieutenant Archer?

05:42.037 --> 05:43.430
You know what I'm gonna ask.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.347
No.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.698
Think about it, Christopher.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.354
I know business
hasn't been the best.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.312
Somehow I'm not seeing
how going back to work

05:56.399 --> 05:58.401
for the cops is
gonna help my gym.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.317
Well, you wouldn't
be a cop. Outside.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.625
The department actually wants
someone from the outside.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.453
We need supplemental training,

06:06.540 --> 06:09.717
a pilot project to be applied
across the department.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.501
Workshops, seminars,

06:11.588 --> 06:12.981
whatever you want,
fully integrated.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.591
Your curriculum, your rules.

06:15.940 --> 06:16.811
Your dad was a good cop-

06:16.898 --> 06:17.638
I'm not,

06:21.555 --> 06:22.773
I'm not interested.

06:26.734 --> 06:27.561
Okay.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.088
I'm in the neighborhood
these days.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.002
12th precinct.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.657
Tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.404
He was more than just
these walls, you know?

07:33.104 --> 07:34.541
What are you doing?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.368
You want
me to stand by?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.457
No, I want you to
do your fucking job, man!

07:37.544 --> 07:38.240
He frickin' shot me, man!

07:38.327 --> 07:39.894
Oh my God!

07:39.981 --> 07:41.025
Do you think Dad would've
been proud of you?

07:41.112 --> 07:42.679
Don't bring Dad into this.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.724
- Don't bring Dad into this.
- Don't touch me.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.290
You know what? I'm sick!

07:45.377 --> 07:46.640
I feel sick.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.990
- I'm sick of this!
- Chris! Chris!

09:29.351 --> 09:30.265
I woulda had that.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.180
Yeah, sure.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.493
Still can't hit a three.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.453
Still talking smack?

09:47.717 --> 09:50.154
Pretty sure I'm up, what,

09:50.241 --> 09:52.374
three games, if I
remember correctly?

09:52.461 --> 09:53.462
Two, actually.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.993
And we both know how
solid your memory is.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.171
What are you doing here?

10:07.258 --> 10:09.304
Official gym business.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.654
Pam thinks running a
diffuse-and-disarm seminar's

10:11.741 --> 10:13.874
gonna change the
world or something.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.092
Jesus, the gym.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.096
Lemme walk you to Pam's office.

10:19.183 --> 10:19.923
No, I'm fine.

10:20.010 --> 10:20.837
Find my own way.

10:22.143 --> 10:22.839
What gives, man?

10:29.890 --> 10:30.499
Hey, Kenny.

10:32.022 --> 10:32.675
Who's your friend?

10:33.894 --> 10:35.765
Chris, my brother.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.160
Chris, you remember
Sergeant Hatton.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.552
Oh yeah, yeah,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.337
your brother.

10:42.424 --> 10:43.643
How could I forget?

10:45.253 --> 10:46.907
The guy who used taxpayer money

10:46.994 --> 10:48.909
to pay his way all the
way up through the academy

10:48.996 --> 10:51.476
right until he found out
what the job was really like.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.697
You seem to know
the story pretty well.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.747
One day pass,
what's the occasion,

11:00.834 --> 11:01.791
family reunion?

11:03.097 --> 11:06.230
Archer's deescalation
initiative, Sir.

11:06.317 --> 11:07.405
Oh, that's right,

11:07.492 --> 11:08.755
that's right, you're here to,

11:08.842 --> 11:10.017
to teach us all
how to play nice,

11:10.104 --> 11:11.671
is that it?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.281
So, uh,

11:13.368 --> 11:14.717
so what's in there,
friendship bracelets?

11:17.894 --> 11:18.634
Go on, show me.

11:21.071 --> 11:21.855
Teach me a lesson.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.294
I don't think
you can afford me.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.384
Go ahead, Mr. Sun.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.820
That's why you're
here after all.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.096
Simunition,

11:46.183 --> 11:48.533
converted to paint markers.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.884
Tactically identical
to your service weapon.

11:50.971 --> 11:51.885
I know what it is.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.196
Hey, watch out, Sarge,

11:59.283 --> 12:02.330
might do a funny mustache
in your face.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.940
Blue means dead.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.421
Works for me.

12:19.042 --> 12:19.651
That'll do.

12:28.791 --> 12:31.707
Don't you have some
paperwork to file, Sergeant?

12:31.794 --> 12:33.056
If you're looking
for something to do,

12:33.143 --> 12:34.231
I'm sure there's
all sorts of things

12:34.318 --> 12:35.450
that could use your attention.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.028
Why didn't
you say anything?

12:49.159 --> 12:49.899
Truth?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.947
I didn't know if
he'd come if I had.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.862
And how long
has Ken been here?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.388
Ken transferred back to
the 12th a few months ago.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.871
He said he reached
out, but nothing.

13:07.743 --> 13:10.224
Oh, and Sergeant Hatton?

13:10.311 --> 13:12.139
Are you kidding me?

13:12.226 --> 13:14.794
Hatton carries a lot
of weight around here.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.099
Look, I don't like
his warrior bullshit

13:16.186 --> 13:17.884
any more than you do,

13:17.971 --> 13:20.277
but if we're going to
change things, Christopher,

13:20.364 --> 13:21.844
we have to work
with guys like him.

13:27.197 --> 13:30.679
I need Hatton, just
like I need you.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.072
Ugh, I'm so dead.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.551
Late night?

13:33.638 --> 13:34.944
No, just dreading
the workload.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.990
Where'd I put the stupid pass?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.818
Sifting through hard
drives really so bad?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.646
Sometimes I wish
I never peeked

13:41.733 --> 13:43.170
behind the curtain
of what people keep

13:43.257 --> 13:44.214
on their computers.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.607
But it does have its perks.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.217
If you say so.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.265
Hey!

13:52.657 --> 13:54.094
Michelle, hey.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.445
Are you here to see Ken?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.578
No, I had an appointment.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.411
Oh, I should go.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.196
Um, later.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.808
Abby, not embarrassing at all.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.288
Yeah, not at all.

14:16.594 --> 14:17.813
So who's your
appointment with?

14:19.597 --> 14:21.295
Pamela Archer.

14:21.382 --> 14:23.079
Wow! Well connected.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.475
She's a friend of my dad's.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.088
You're off duty later?

14:33.307 --> 14:35.352
Sure.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.239
Mark 'em.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.544
Kicking my ass.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.508
What compels people to eat
finger food while they bowl?

15:05.817 --> 15:08.211
Oh, they're sociopaths.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.474
Anyways, it wasn't
really about the help.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.824
It's more just testing a theory,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.001
and thank you for proving it.

15:15.088 --> 15:15.697
Which is?

15:18.439 --> 15:19.222
Cops like to bowl.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.964
Are you profiling me now?

15:23.357 --> 15:24.227
It's just a theory.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.534
Can I profile you?

15:28.623 --> 15:29.885
You and your brother,

15:33.628 --> 15:34.585
there's something there.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.459
You ask that as if you
didn't read all about it.

15:48.382 --> 15:48.991
That's game.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.958
We don't have to talk about
family if you don't want to.

15:59.045 --> 15:59.654
No, it's fine.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.309
After that, me and Ken

16:04.572 --> 16:05.268
just don't see eye to eye.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.059
New game?

16:13.146 --> 16:14.538
- Yeah, sure.
- Let's do it.

16:25.941 --> 16:26.986
Well, I had fun.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.335
Losing five games is fun?

16:29.292 --> 16:30.119
Yeah, well...

16:32.948 --> 16:34.471
Unsolicited advice,

16:34.558 --> 16:35.603
talk to your brother.

16:37.431 --> 16:40.695
Also, text me if
you want a rematch.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.612
Also, just text me anyway.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.855
Five-O!

19:05.883 --> 19:07.581
Hey, sorry I didn't
get back to you,

19:07.668 --> 19:09.713
I was busy.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.893
I guess I have been
avoiding you a bit.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.550
Anyways, hit me up.

19:20.637 --> 19:21.856
Maybe we can, uh,

19:21.943 --> 19:23.031
schedule that rematch.

19:26.643 --> 19:27.644
It was good to see you.

19:29.603 --> 19:30.430
Bye.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.261
Fuck you, pig!

19:37.741 --> 19:38.742
Fuckin' bullshit!

19:38.829 --> 19:39.700
Shut up.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.268
Come on, man,
I didn't do nothin'!

19:42.355 --> 19:43.225
I said shut up.

19:48.926 --> 19:49.797
Where's the Sarge?

19:52.626 --> 19:53.322
He's cleanin' up.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.553
Boss wants you
waiting out front.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.034
All right.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.211
Now. I can take him from here.

20:15.562 --> 20:16.650
I said out front.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.696
Now.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.933
Don't do me like that!

20:39.020 --> 20:39.803
Don't leave me here!

21:09.268 --> 21:10.660
Hold on.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.535
Ken?

21:15.622 --> 21:16.492
Ken! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:16.579 --> 21:17.711
Ken! Ken! Ken!

21:17.798 --> 21:18.755
Ken! What happened?

21:18.842 --> 21:19.582
What happened to you?

21:19.669 --> 21:21.018
Sh-sh-sh-shot.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.281
Who shot, who shot you?

21:24.457 --> 21:25.588
Shit! Fuck!

21:27.068 --> 21:27.808
Shit!

21:30.071 --> 21:31.464
Hey, it's okay.

21:31.551 --> 21:32.943
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.205
I'm gonna get you help, okay?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.598
Please, come on! Come on, Ken!

21:35.685 --> 21:36.512
Hide.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.779
No! No, no!

21:42.866 --> 21:44.085
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

21:44.172 --> 21:46.217
Please, please! Ken!

21:46.305 --> 21:50.874
Shit!

21:54.704 --> 21:55.923
Shit!

21:56.010 --> 21:56.750
Fuck!

21:57.881 --> 21:59.230
Police!

21:59.318 --> 22:01.276
We had a report about
an officer down.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.146
He's up here!

22:02.233 --> 22:02.930
He's hurt.

22:11.721 --> 22:12.809
What happened?

22:12.896 --> 22:14.376
I don't know, he just,

22:14.463 --> 22:16.030
he was banging on my
door, I opened it,

22:16.117 --> 22:17.510
and I-I found him like this.

22:19.860 --> 22:20.948
Excuse me, Ma'am,

22:21.035 --> 22:22.123
can I talk to you over here?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.864
Just some questions.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.866
You sure?

22:25.953 --> 22:27.041
He didn't say anything? He
didn't give you anything?

22:28.521 --> 22:29.130
No.

22:34.701 --> 22:35.528
Freeze.

22:37.225 --> 22:37.965
Put your hands up.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.185
On your feet!

22:42.883 --> 22:43.710
Let's go.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.062
Now back up.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.237
I said get back!

22:50.586 --> 22:51.326
Check him.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.069
Eyes on me.

22:56.026 --> 22:56.984
Back up!

22:59.160 --> 23:00.074
Nice and slow.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.338
Go!

23:07.473 --> 23:08.082
More!

23:10.345 --> 23:10.998
Keep going.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.000
Freeze!

23:15.959 --> 23:16.786
Stop there.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.139
Check the other rooms.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.318
Get down on your knees, slowly.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.191
Now drop it.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.020
Put it on the ground.

23:38.068 --> 23:38.895
We're clear.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.031
What did he tell you?

23:50.037 --> 23:51.604
It's too bad.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.562
I was kinda looking
forward to your class.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.131
Gun! Gun!

24:25.028 --> 24:26.465
Go. Go!

24:41.349 --> 24:42.089
Oh, shit!

24:55.494 --> 24:56.103
Hello?

24:57.408 --> 25:00.542
Yes.

25:00.629 --> 25:01.717
No, no problem.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.241
I'll be there.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.112
What's the address?

25:08.550 --> 25:09.333
Say that again?

26:15.878 --> 26:16.923
Detective?

26:17.967 --> 26:18.794
A word?

26:26.410 --> 26:27.803
They found the car back here.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.676
Brother's apartment,

26:30.763 --> 26:32.329
must've been visiting.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.504
The brother's missing.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.767
House keys are still upstairs.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.507
So they left in a hurry.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.248
Didn't or couldn't
stick around for us.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.989
What happened here?

26:40.076 --> 26:41.469
There were already two
off-duty officers on scene

26:41.556 --> 26:42.949
when first responders showed up.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.559
Who?

26:44.646 --> 26:46.517
Kurt Spencer, Winston
Gale, they're on the-

26:46.605 --> 26:48.476
I know who they are.

26:48.563 --> 26:49.390
Yeah, apparently they were
nearby when they heard shots.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.521
Both received injuries,

26:50.609 --> 26:52.436
retrieved on the scene by EMTs.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.177
They declined further care

26:54.264 --> 26:56.702
and left the responding
units to deal with the mess.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.486
Did they identify
their attacker?

26:58.573 --> 27:00.706
Only description
was an Asian male.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.272
Asian male?

27:02.359 --> 27:03.796
Like the missing brother.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.058
Yeah, they said
they'd file reports,

27:05.145 --> 27:06.799
then they left.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.322
Well, where the
fuck did they go?

27:47.317 --> 27:48.971
Speak.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.277
We didn't get to him in time.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.282
So, you don't have it?

27:56.500 --> 27:57.763
- No.
- We couldn't find it.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.721
The brother must have it.

27:59.808 --> 28:00.679
Brother must have it.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.857
Let me ask you a question.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.295
Keeping in mind all the other
things I gotta deal with,

28:08.382 --> 28:10.123
all the delaying, diverting,

28:10.210 --> 28:11.646
destroying as a result.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.345
Could you have possibly
fucked this up any worse?

28:16.477 --> 28:17.652
It's encrypted.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.567
It's not like he
can do anything.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.658
Don't fuckin' touch him.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.227
I try to be fair, boys.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.011
We all look out for each other,

28:29.098 --> 28:30.578
we all get an equal share,

28:30.665 --> 28:33.973
we all clean up after
ourselves, fair?

28:34.060 --> 28:34.669
I think so.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.237
So this is how
we're gonna do it.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.586
You're gonna find him,

28:38.673 --> 28:39.543
get rid of him.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.415
Hey! Pay attention.

28:41.502 --> 28:43.460
Find it, get rid of it.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.506
No ifs, ands, or buts.

28:45.593 --> 28:46.333
Is that fair?

28:48.465 --> 28:49.423
I can't hear you, is that fair?

28:49.510 --> 28:50.816
- It's fair.
- Fair.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.558
Good.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.430
Clean yourselves up,
you look like shit.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.127
And call King, start looking.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.913
No one says anything to
anyone until I say so.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.136
Lucky I'm in a good
mood today, Gale.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.065
Lieutenant?

30:06.152 --> 30:08.284
Respectfully, what the
hell is going on here?

30:08.371 --> 30:09.459
I've got one dead cop,

30:09.546 --> 30:10.983
one missing brother,

30:11.070 --> 30:13.246
both of whom you
know personally,

30:13.333 --> 30:15.074
and eyewitnesses who say

30:15.161 --> 30:17.076
that two off-duty cops may
have just walked right in

30:17.163 --> 30:19.426
and started shooting
up the place.

30:19.513 --> 30:20.862
Why did you assign
me to this case?

30:20.949 --> 30:22.864
Detective,

30:22.951 --> 30:25.214
is there some reason why you
shouldn't be on this case?

30:26.607 --> 30:28.174
I gave you this case

30:28.261 --> 30:30.263
because I know that you
can handle it for me.

30:30.350 --> 30:33.266
Yes, I know both of
the Sun brothers.

30:33.353 --> 30:34.441
I knew their father too.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.400
He was a good cop.

30:37.487 --> 30:40.055
I would hate to tarnish
his name or the precinct's.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.709
If I'm going to
avoid doing that,

30:42.014 --> 30:45.017
I need you to please help me
make sense of all of this.

30:50.022 --> 30:51.284
Anything you wanna share?

30:52.546 --> 30:54.374
Uh, maybe, Ma'am.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.028
I'll keep you posted
if I have something.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.089
Hey.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.047
Where is he?

31:15.134 --> 31:15.961
He's inside.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.267
Did you phone it in?

31:18.354 --> 31:19.834
Nah,

31:19.921 --> 31:21.401
no, I figured you
guys wanna handle it.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.490
Yeah, you figured right.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.189
Police
are on the hunt

31:27.276 --> 31:29.017
for an Asian male
named Christopher Sun,

31:29.104 --> 31:31.237
who evaded arrest after
police found his brother,

31:31.324 --> 31:32.803
a plainclothes officer,

31:32.891 --> 31:34.457
murdered at his apartment.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.503
If seen, please do not approach.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.245
The suspect should be
considered armed and dangerous.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.638
Any information on his
whereabouts should be reported

31:41.725 --> 31:42.901
to your local authorities.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.947
So what's the plan?

31:46.034 --> 31:47.079
We got it from here.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.559
Yeah.

31:49.646 --> 31:50.909
Good looking out, Gary.

31:53.041 --> 31:53.781
Hold up, whoa.

32:27.728 --> 32:28.729
Chris.

32:32.951 --> 32:33.560
Sorry.

32:34.909 --> 32:35.736
It's okay.

32:37.259 --> 32:40.784
Fucked.

32:47.835 --> 32:51.534
Chris, I'm so sorry about Ken.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.715
You need to tell
me what happened.

32:58.802 --> 32:59.586
I can help you,

33:00.804 --> 33:02.415
but this doesn't look good.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.156
You hiding like this,

33:04.243 --> 33:05.722
it makes you look guilty.

33:05.809 --> 33:07.420
Yeah, well, what
was I supposed to do?

33:07.507 --> 33:08.334
They were cops.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.553
What?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.120
Two of them.

33:12.207 --> 33:13.382
Ken was running from them.

33:15.297 --> 33:15.950
I had to run too.

33:18.648 --> 33:19.823
Did you get their names?

33:21.216 --> 33:22.348
One called the
other one Spencer.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.136
They tried to kill me.

33:28.223 --> 33:30.617
Okay, do you
have any idea why?

33:36.231 --> 33:37.885
Ken gave me this.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.930
It's gotta be connected.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.454
Okay, here, here's
what we're gonna do.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.585
I'm gonna get you in
protective custody-

33:42.672 --> 33:44.022
No, no way.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.545
You can't keep
hiding here, Chris.

33:45.632 --> 33:46.676
There are things we need to do,

33:46.763 --> 33:47.677
you have to give me a statement,

33:47.764 --> 33:48.635
I can protect you.

33:48.722 --> 33:49.766
What, from the police?

33:49.853 --> 33:51.464
I don't have a choice.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.031
This is my case.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.423
Consider this
an anonymous tip.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.078
That's not how it works.

34:00.212 --> 34:00.734
Forget it.

34:06.957 --> 34:07.654
No.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.048
Nothing on the radio.

34:11.310 --> 34:12.876
Okay.

34:12.963 --> 34:15.096
Keep an eye out, don't
move till I get there.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.100
It's all there?

34:19.187 --> 34:20.667
Yeah, of course
it's all there.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.457
What are you waiting
for, a fuckin' handjob?

34:28.544 --> 34:29.371
Get out.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.680
Listen to me.

34:35.595 --> 34:38.206
I could eat your bosses
and your dad for breakfast,

34:38.293 --> 34:40.339
and you don't wanna know
what I could do to you.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.123
All you need to know is
that when I call you, come,

34:42.210 --> 34:43.385
and when I say so, you go.

34:44.647 --> 34:45.648
So get the fuck out.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.445
Fuckin' asshole.

34:59.532 --> 35:00.707
Crazy bastard.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.582
Chris?

35:12.762 --> 35:13.720
You don't need that.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.679
I wanna believe that, Chris,

35:16.766 --> 35:19.117
but I need to know you're
gonna make the right decision.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.466
You really think
I'm safe with you?

35:20.553 --> 35:22.032
You want justice, this is how.

35:22.120 --> 35:22.772
Justice?

35:24.165 --> 35:25.601
Those cops are
gonna jump through

35:25.688 --> 35:27.473
whatever hoops they
have to for the optics.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.735
They'll be protected,

35:28.822 --> 35:29.953
Ken will still be dead.

35:30.040 --> 35:30.867
What would you do?

35:32.391 --> 35:33.435
Help me out here, Chris.

35:34.654 --> 35:35.524
I am.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.745
You've got everything you need.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.282
If you're not
gonna come in now,

35:54.369 --> 35:55.501
at least wait here.

35:55.588 --> 35:56.632
I'll talk to Archer.

35:56.719 --> 35:57.764
She cares about you.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.941
I'll be back soon.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.769
Here, eat something.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.303
Oh! There she is.

36:31.624 --> 36:32.494
You still here?

36:33.930 --> 36:35.193
Yeah.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.194
Shit.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.151
You, uh,

36:37.238 --> 36:38.021
you got any coffee?

36:39.762 --> 36:40.807
Yeah, sure.

36:41.895 --> 36:43.549
Help yourself.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.202
Thanks.

36:45.986 --> 36:46.987
Two bucks.

36:48.815 --> 36:49.685
Yeah.

36:53.907 --> 36:54.864
Extra five.

36:56.518 --> 36:57.345
Extended shoe rental.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.371
Hey, hey! Hands up, hands up.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.462
Don't fuckin' move.

37:27.549 --> 37:28.420
Where is it, asshole?

37:29.638 --> 37:30.422
It's in my pocket.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.033
Don't!

37:33.120 --> 37:33.860
Hands up.

37:35.644 --> 37:36.471
King,

37:37.994 --> 37:39.082
check it.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.194
Why'd you kill him?

40:14.281 --> 40:15.021
You, huh?

40:15.978 --> 40:17.023
You the one?

40:19.982 --> 40:20.940
Fuck you.

40:32.821 --> 40:33.648
Why?

40:49.969 --> 40:50.970
Why'd you kill him?

41:00.806 --> 41:01.633
Wait.

41:03.156 --> 41:04.157
He saw...

41:06.376 --> 41:07.073
What did he see?

42:10.745 --> 42:11.833
Ugh.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.748
Oh!

42:13.835 --> 42:14.444
Dude!

42:15.924 --> 42:17.709
You know it's, like,
present day, right?

42:17.796 --> 42:20.320
You coulda DMed or emailed
or texted or do the,

42:20.407 --> 42:22.017
okay, come in.

42:23.453 --> 42:25.543
Anyway, you
owe me a new table

42:25.630 --> 42:27.066
'cause there is no way

42:27.240 --> 42:29.329
- that stain is gonna come out.
- Abby, shh.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.941
Sup?

42:33.028 --> 42:34.682
So Ab, you know how to
recover a hard drive, right?

42:36.554 --> 42:38.599
I mean, I could explain to you

42:38.686 --> 42:40.514
why that's a silly
question to ask someone

42:40.601 --> 42:42.385
who worked for three years in
criminal computer forensics,

42:42.472 --> 42:44.344
but I mean, I just-

42:44.431 --> 42:46.912
So if I gave you a memory
card or a damaged hard drive,

42:46.999 --> 42:48.783
you'd be able to
show me what's on it?

42:48.870 --> 42:51.046
That doesn't sound very
official, Detective Tasbar.

42:51.133 --> 42:53.179
It's not, I just, um,

42:54.441 --> 42:55.573
I need someone I can trust.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.359
Ab, I wouldn't be asking.

43:02.492 --> 43:03.363
Okay, what is it?

43:04.843 --> 43:07.410
Oh! Okay, I get it.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.197
Sure, I'll help.

43:13.199 --> 43:14.461
Is there anything
else I can do?

43:14.548 --> 43:15.810
No, just leave it with me,

43:15.897 --> 43:17.420
I'll call you when
I get something.

43:17.507 --> 43:18.683
So get outta here

43:18.770 --> 43:19.988
- so I can work.
- Thank you.

43:20.162 --> 43:22.208
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you, thank you.

43:37.179 --> 43:38.746
Sir?

43:38.833 --> 43:40.487
Sir, are you okay?

43:43.055 --> 43:43.882
I know you.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.232
Who did this to you?

43:47.755 --> 43:49.191
Okay, I'm gonna get
you some help, okay?

43:49.278 --> 43:50.149
Just stay still.

43:55.284 --> 43:56.242
This is Detective Tasbar.

44:16.436 --> 44:17.219
Hello?

44:17.306 --> 44:18.264
Lieutenant?

44:19.657 --> 44:22.703
Detective,
what do you need?

44:24.705 --> 44:26.359
I have
reason to believe

44:26.446 --> 44:28.622
that Officer Sun's
brother, Chris,

44:28.709 --> 44:30.450
is likely pursuing
a personal vendetta

44:30.537 --> 44:32.757
against Sergeant
Hatton and his squad.

44:32.844 --> 44:36.543
I see.

44:36.630 --> 44:38.980
You don't sound surprised.

44:39.067 --> 44:41.287
Not much
surprises me, Detective.

44:41.374 --> 44:42.767
Do you like sushi?

44:46.988 --> 44:47.597
Sure, uh.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.590
Wait, wait!

45:24.634 --> 45:25.810
You piece of shit.

45:25.897 --> 45:27.159
I told you to wait,

45:27.246 --> 45:29.204
just do what I tell you!

45:29.291 --> 45:30.684
He was gonna get away.

45:30.771 --> 45:32.164
Was gonna get away.

45:32.251 --> 45:33.731
You thought letting
him kick your ass

45:33.818 --> 45:34.601
and then getting away
was a better idea?

45:34.688 --> 45:36.908
Huh? Hey?

45:36.995 --> 45:38.213
What does he know?

45:38.300 --> 45:39.388
He knows nothing.

45:42.391 --> 45:43.958
He said something.

45:44.045 --> 45:45.307
I can hear him, hit him again.

45:45.394 --> 45:46.265
I didn't!

45:46.352 --> 45:47.222
Sarge.

45:48.876 --> 45:49.485
My neighbors.

45:58.277 --> 45:59.365
Get him outta here.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.454
Come on, Champ.

46:01.541 --> 46:02.934
I'll kiss it better.

46:03.021 --> 46:03.891
Get off me!

46:05.893 --> 46:08.417
Everybody lays low
until I call, okay?

46:08.504 --> 46:09.636
I'm still good to go.

46:09.723 --> 46:11.681
Yeah, me too, Boss.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.248
Lay low!

46:13.335 --> 46:14.380
What part don't you
fuckin' understand?

46:14.467 --> 46:15.903
Do I need to explain myself?

46:15.990 --> 46:17.470
No, I hear you fine.

46:17.557 --> 46:19.037
But what about Tasbar?

46:19.124 --> 46:20.168
I'll take care of it.

46:20.255 --> 46:21.561
Okay? I got somewhere to be.

46:21.648 --> 46:22.692
Get him home.

46:22.780 --> 46:25.130
You, just fuckin' go inside.

46:25.217 --> 46:26.000
Go inside.

46:31.745 --> 46:33.051
Fuckin' assholes.

46:37.925 --> 46:38.796
Mm!

46:44.671 --> 46:47.239
Do you want anything?

46:47.326 --> 46:48.414
That'll be all, thank you.

46:51.330 --> 46:52.200
Sake.

46:53.898 --> 46:55.595
I have to say I'm
confused, Ma'am..

46:55.682 --> 46:56.422
About what?

46:57.553 --> 47:00.556
Well, why we're here.

47:00.643 --> 47:02.645
We still haven't heard anything
from Hatton and his squad,

47:02.732 --> 47:05.518
Chris is out there
somewhere hiding from them,

47:05.605 --> 47:07.302
from us,

47:07.389 --> 47:09.435
and you're having
a late-night snack.

47:11.654 --> 47:12.438
Why?

47:14.309 --> 47:14.875
Lieutenant,

47:16.485 --> 47:18.792
you didn't tell me
this was an ambush.

47:18.879 --> 47:20.838
Let's call it an
impromptu case review.

47:20.925 --> 47:21.534
Mm.

47:24.363 --> 47:25.799
My officers' medicals.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.584
Clearing them of any misconduct.

47:33.328 --> 47:36.157
Post-traumatic
stress? You're kidding.

47:36.244 --> 47:39.378
Yeah, losing a fellow officer
is a traumatic experience.

47:39.465 --> 47:41.336
You'd know that if you ever
used your service weapon

47:41.423 --> 47:42.947
anywhere but the range.

47:43.034 --> 47:45.253
This still doesn't say
anything about Chris.

47:45.340 --> 47:47.125
Where was he?

47:47.212 --> 47:48.953
Why did they even go to his
home in the first place?

47:49.040 --> 47:50.476
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

47:52.260 --> 47:55.133
Yeah, they were
responding to shots fired.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.570
Yeah, the suspect was an
Asian male wearing a mask

47:57.657 --> 48:01.356
who fled the scene after
killing Officer Sun.

48:01.443 --> 48:04.185
Disgruntled former police
officer shoots estranged brother

48:04.272 --> 48:06.013
before declaring war on cops.

48:07.058 --> 48:08.668
Mm-hmm.

48:08.755 --> 48:10.583
Seems to me like Chris is
the most likely suspect.

48:10.670 --> 48:12.063
And by the way, I didn't know

48:12.150 --> 48:13.891
you two were on a
first-name basis.

48:13.978 --> 48:15.718
You wouldn't happen to be
fuckin' him too, would you?

48:15.805 --> 48:17.590
Likely, huh?

48:17.677 --> 48:19.853
Like the blood in the car
leading up to the apartment?

48:19.940 --> 48:23.465
How about criminals in uniform
gun down fellow officer,

48:23.552 --> 48:24.858
hunt surviving brother.

48:24.945 --> 48:25.728
Might sound good
on the news, right?

48:25.815 --> 48:26.468
Enough.

48:27.861 --> 48:29.950
I brought you here
to pool our resources

48:30.037 --> 48:33.649
and find Chris unharmed
and in custody.

48:33.736 --> 48:34.999
And the Sergeant
brought the medicals,

48:35.086 --> 48:36.609
and as half-assed
as that help is,

48:36.696 --> 48:37.915
he is here to help.

48:39.177 --> 48:40.265
I'm listening.

48:40.352 --> 48:41.135
So listen, then.

48:44.530 --> 48:45.444
What have you learned?

48:50.492 --> 48:52.842
I tracked Chris down
to a bowling alley.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.019
There I found an
unconscious employee

48:55.106 --> 48:56.542
and the signs of a
pretty bad fight.

48:58.283 --> 49:00.067
But whoever was there
destroyed the security footage

49:00.154 --> 49:00.938
before they left.

49:03.027 --> 49:05.855
I have units there now
going over everything.

49:05.943 --> 49:09.207
Right now, I think that
Chris went up against...

49:12.775 --> 49:14.560
Where is the rest of
your squad, Sergeant?

49:17.998 --> 49:20.218
Well, besides
Spencer and Gale,

49:20.305 --> 49:22.307
who are resting at home,

49:22.394 --> 49:23.221
where are they?

49:24.352 --> 49:25.963
Off duty until morning huddle.

50:01.607 --> 50:02.825
Goddamn timer.

50:04.784 --> 50:05.611
Christ.

50:16.491 --> 50:17.710
Don't move.

50:31.680 --> 50:32.551
Please, don't kill me.

50:32.638 --> 50:33.508
Shut up.

50:36.511 --> 50:37.077
Put it on.

50:39.993 --> 50:41.038
Okay, okay.

50:57.489 --> 50:59.099
Keep going.

51:00.405 --> 51:01.275
Keep going.

51:20.729 --> 51:22.253
More.

51:35.788 --> 51:36.658
Stand up.

51:49.758 --> 51:50.716
Pick it up.

51:55.895 --> 51:58.289
I didn't ask if you wanted to.

51:58.376 --> 52:01.205
I didn't ask you
anything, actually.

52:14.043 --> 52:14.740
Get up.

52:24.097 --> 52:24.837
Pick it up.

52:30.669 --> 52:31.626
Pick it up.

52:35.021 --> 52:35.761
Take it.

53:10.796 --> 53:12.145
I'm, I'm sorry.

53:12.232 --> 53:13.842
I'm sorry!

53:13.929 --> 53:15.583
I didn't want to.

53:15.670 --> 53:18.760
It was Hatton and Perry,

53:18.847 --> 53:20.371
not me.

53:20.458 --> 53:22.721
I was just doing
what they told me.

53:22.808 --> 53:24.331
What did he see, huh?

53:24.418 --> 53:25.506
I don't know.

53:25.593 --> 53:27.421
I don't know! I wasn't there!

53:27.508 --> 53:28.117
Please!

53:42.784 --> 53:44.786
Why don't I believe you?

53:50.662 --> 53:51.445
Feel that?

53:51.532 --> 53:52.359
Trying to talk?

53:53.882 --> 53:54.753
Beg?

53:55.797 --> 53:57.016
Can't get a single word out?

53:59.627 --> 54:04.458
Now you know how he felt.

54:10.899 --> 54:13.598
Code.

54:16.340 --> 54:21.170
One, two, seven, nine.

54:25.784 --> 54:27.002
Don't warn them.

54:27.089 --> 54:28.874
I can do that myself.

54:33.792 --> 54:35.620
All right.

54:35.707 --> 54:38.405
I want your squad in my
office before morning huddle.

54:38.492 --> 54:39.754
We're gonna go over
every bit of evidence

54:39.841 --> 54:41.278
until I'm satisfied.

54:41.365 --> 54:42.453
Tomorrow? Chris is
out there tonight,

54:42.540 --> 54:43.802
right now.

54:43.889 --> 54:45.325
Well, it's your
case, Detective.

54:46.457 --> 54:49.068
Go detect.

54:51.157 --> 54:53.681
See you in the morning.

54:55.596 --> 54:56.771
How can you trust him?

54:56.858 --> 54:58.469
We all know what he is.

54:59.513 --> 55:02.516
Who says I trust him?

55:02.603 --> 55:03.778
I need him.

55:03.865 --> 55:05.302
There's a difference.

55:07.565 --> 55:09.044
What?

55:09.175 --> 55:10.829
Spencer's
in trouble, Sergeant.

55:12.396 --> 55:13.527
Well, he's not the only one,

55:13.614 --> 55:15.355
you fuckin' piece of shit.

55:15.442 --> 55:17.009
Listen, whatever
you're doing to him

55:17.096 --> 55:18.706
I'm gonna make look like
a trip to the beauty salon

55:18.793 --> 55:20.665
when I'm done with you.

55:20.752 --> 55:22.362
I don't think Spencer
likes that kinda language.

55:22.449 --> 55:23.189
Wait, no!

55:25.496 --> 55:28.281
Did you pull
the trigger, or Perry?

55:28.368 --> 55:29.978
Which one of you
looked him in the eye?

55:30.065 --> 55:31.676
Or were you even brave
enough to do that?

55:31.763 --> 55:34.243
Brave? Brave?

55:34.331 --> 55:37.508
You don't know a fucking
thing about brave, okay?

55:37.595 --> 55:39.597
We protect you from the animals,

55:39.684 --> 55:41.381
you ungrateful children,

55:41.468 --> 55:43.514
because we have the strength
to do what you can't.

55:43.601 --> 55:44.732
That's brave.

55:44.819 --> 55:46.299
Putting down the threat.

55:46.386 --> 55:48.388
Is that
what he was to you?

55:48.475 --> 55:49.346
Threat?

55:49.433 --> 55:50.956
Maybe he was both.

55:51.043 --> 55:52.958
Maybe you are too.

55:53.045 --> 55:53.959
Well, you're
gonna get the chance

55:54.046 --> 55:56.048
to find out, Sergeant.

55:56.135 --> 55:56.918
Sooner than you may think.

55:57.005 --> 55:58.311
Oh yeah?

55:58.398 --> 56:00.008
You wanna come for
me, is that it?

56:00.095 --> 56:02.184
Well, you come and you
see what fuckin' happens,

56:02.271 --> 56:04.361
'cause you got a lot more
to lose than a brother

56:04.448 --> 56:05.449
and a shitty gym.

56:09.670 --> 56:10.976
A lot more than you think.

56:53.322 --> 56:54.106
When
you forget it's there

56:54.193 --> 56:54.933
next to your door.

56:57.022 --> 56:58.719
- I'm telling you, man.
- You'll make 'em wet

56:58.806 --> 57:00.373
- and confused.
- It's crazy, Bro.

57:00.460 --> 57:02.767
Shouldn't you guys be home?

57:02.854 --> 57:04.029
Uh, and who are you?

57:06.423 --> 57:07.946
Oh, hey.

57:08.033 --> 57:08.860
Look at that.

57:10.818 --> 57:11.645
That's me.

57:14.082 --> 57:15.736
We're just chillin'.

57:15.823 --> 57:18.609
Sure you are, Bro.

57:18.696 --> 57:19.740
What's in the backpack?

57:20.915 --> 57:22.221
School shit.

57:22.308 --> 57:23.048
Oh yeah?

57:24.789 --> 57:26.399
Not gonna find any
surprises in there, am I?

57:33.841 --> 57:35.060
Okay, okay.

57:36.104 --> 57:37.062
Clean this shit up.

57:42.546 --> 57:44.025
What's that?

57:44.112 --> 57:45.070
You got somethin' to say?

57:46.898 --> 57:49.161
Nah, 'cause I'm pretty sure

57:49.248 --> 57:52.469
- something on your mind.
- Whoa, take it easy, man!

57:52.556 --> 57:53.861
Yo, chill, chill!

57:54.775 --> 57:55.602
Well?

57:57.299 --> 57:59.563
You sure you ain't got
any community feedback?

58:06.831 --> 58:08.093
That's right! Go run home!

58:26.154 --> 58:26.938
Hello?

58:28.505 --> 58:29.114
Hey.

58:40.429 --> 58:43.824
You're not the
begging type, are you?

58:43.911 --> 58:45.043
Come on.

58:54.705 --> 58:56.228
Was it you?

58:56.315 --> 58:57.708
Were you the one that
pulled the trigger?

58:57.795 --> 59:00.275
I
don't like to brag.

59:02.495 --> 59:03.148
Why?

59:04.628 --> 59:07.500
Ask me nicely.

59:07.587 --> 59:08.327
Why?

59:10.459 --> 59:13.375
I'll tell you what a
bitch your dead brother was.

59:38.270 --> 59:39.837
Ah!

59:39.924 --> 59:41.926
Oh, come on!

59:43.275 --> 59:44.668
Don't you want your vengeance?

59:46.757 --> 59:48.672
This is your big
revenge kick, huh?

59:50.064 --> 59:53.067
Because your brother
died squealing,

59:53.154 --> 59:53.981
something like that.

01:00:10.563 --> 01:00:11.477
Run, Chrissy!

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:20.399
You know that all I have to
do is follow the blood, right?

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.058
Come on now, Chrissy!

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:31.236
You know you can't
run from the law.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:35.936
You know Kenny Boy couldn't.

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:39.636
I did mention how
much your brother died

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.246
like a bitch, right?

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.258
Ah! Come out!

01:00:55.782 --> 01:01:00.047
Have a little bit more balls
than your brother, huh?

01:02:53.421 --> 01:02:54.727
Jesus! Are you okay?

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:57.991
Fine, it's not
as bad as it looks.

01:02:58.078 --> 01:02:59.863
I gotta tell you, man,

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.777
you're gonna have a really
hard time convincing anyone

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.213
to keep you out of jail.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.214
The bowling alley?

01:03:03.301 --> 01:03:04.302
They came after me.

01:03:05.738 --> 01:03:07.522
Right after you left, actually.

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:09.873
In fact, every other
cop I've laid eyes on

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.266
in the last 24 hours
has tried to kill me.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.791
So jail's about the last
thing I'm worried about.

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:15.443
Who was it?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.797
It was Gale and King.

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:23.843
After that, I went
after Spencer and Perry.

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:24.801
Now it's just Hatton.

01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:26.019
Goddammit, Chris!

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:31.111
I told Archer I would
bring you in unharmed.

01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:33.026
You've been running
around beating the shit

01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:34.506
out of police all night.

01:03:34.593 --> 01:03:35.463
What did you think
was gonna happen?

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:36.334
It doesn't matter!

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:37.335
Ken's dead!

01:03:39.772 --> 01:03:40.425
I didn't,

01:03:41.992 --> 01:03:42.949
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.649
I don't know what you're
trying to accomplish,

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.956
but what it looks like
right now is you're obsessed

01:03:50.043 --> 01:03:51.697
with delivering pain

01:03:51.784 --> 01:03:53.264
and you don't give a shit
about justice for Ken.

01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:56.223
I'm trying to help you.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.312
Archer's trying to help you.

01:03:58.399 --> 01:04:01.054
You're pretty much the only
one right now not helping you.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:16.461
What?

01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:20.944
Nothing.

01:04:26.384 --> 01:04:27.080
Where are we going?

01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:45.316
Were you followed?

01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:46.491
No, I don't think so.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.842
Michelle, can I talk to you?

01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:52.845
Actually, do you wanna, um,

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.499
get some of that blood
off in the bathroom?

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.718
There's towels, just go nuts.

01:05:05.118 --> 01:05:06.859
Jesus, Ab, are you okay?

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:08.469
No!

01:05:08.556 --> 01:05:10.428
And neither are you or
your boyfriend upstairs?

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:12.647
Michelle, do you realize what
you've gotten yourself into?

01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:14.301
What you've gotten me into?

01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:15.868
Calm down.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.565
What's going on?

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:18.740
Well, I recovered
something from that

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:19.872
I really shouldn't have seen!

01:05:19.959 --> 01:05:20.829
Yes, what is it?

01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:24.311
You better be sure
you wanna know the answer

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:25.704
to that question.

01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:47.247
I'm sorry, Ab.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:48.161
You shouldn't.

01:05:49.206 --> 01:05:49.815
I'm sorry.

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:56.561
So am I.

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.395
I did this to both of you.

01:06:06.179 --> 01:06:08.312
Michelle wouldn't have asked
you if I didn't ask her first.

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.271
She the only one I could go to.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:23.631
Look, maybe I would've
done it anyway, okay?

01:06:23.718 --> 01:06:26.286
Just watch it so we can
figure out what to do next.

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:30.987
Get down!

01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:36.775
Ah!

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:47.699
Shit!

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:49.918
Is she?

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.616
Yeah.

01:06:51.703 --> 01:06:53.879
How bad is it?

01:06:53.966 --> 01:06:55.446
Shallow.

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:56.621
Clean through, just
keep pressure on it.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:57.535
Ah!

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.626
Okay we gotta go, now!

01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:02.583
You can move
faster without me.

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:03.584
No, you need help!

01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:04.629
Chris, I'll be fine!

01:07:04.716 --> 01:07:06.718
Get it to Archer.

01:07:06.805 --> 01:07:08.720
Go!

01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:09.634
Go!

01:07:58.639 --> 01:07:59.727
I thought you
didn't like to get close

01:07:59.814 --> 01:08:01.425
to this side of things.

01:08:01.512 --> 01:08:03.166
I don't,

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:04.732
but you don't give me
much of a choice, do you?

01:08:04.819 --> 01:08:06.430
It's the job, Boss.

01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:07.387
You don't like what you see,

01:08:07.474 --> 01:08:08.475
join the Red Cross.

01:08:09.607 --> 01:08:11.696
This is how we keep the peace.

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:14.394
You don't
get to make jokes.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.135
Not with Ken complaining
about you to me

01:08:16.222 --> 01:08:17.702
every chance he gets.

01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:19.834
And now he's threatening
to go over my head.

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:21.836
That's bad for all of us.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.447
So keep your shit together

01:08:23.534 --> 01:08:25.275
until I can get his
ass into another unit.

01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:26.537
Clean this up.

01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:28.713
I hear you, mm-hmm.

01:08:30.802 --> 01:08:32.195
Get Spencer to bring
the car around,

01:08:32.282 --> 01:08:32.934
we're outta here.

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:35.372
Oh shit, get him!

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.085
Shit, Deac, you okay?

01:08:53.172 --> 01:08:54.391
Do I look okay?

01:08:54.478 --> 01:08:56.044
Oh, fuck!

01:08:56.132 --> 01:08:59.918
I had to take
all the back streets.

01:09:02.529 --> 01:09:03.922
Fuck, I'm bleeding bad, man.

01:09:05.315 --> 01:09:06.838
Yeah, you know
what? I got a kit.

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:08.405
Let's take you inside
and sit you down, okay?

01:09:24.595 --> 01:09:25.161
Christopher?

01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:28.338
Where's Michelle?

01:09:28.425 --> 01:09:29.382
She's safe,

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:30.775
in rough shape but safe.

01:09:30.862 --> 01:09:32.907
I'm getting her
all the help I can.

01:09:32.994 --> 01:09:34.735
Are you safe? Where are you?

01:09:34.822 --> 01:09:36.215
I wanna talk to her.

01:09:36.302 --> 01:09:37.347
Just trust me.

01:09:37.434 --> 01:09:38.609
She's fine, okay?

01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:40.263
Christopher, where are you?

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.786
It's probably best
if you don't know.

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:48.053
Did you
recover the recorder?

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.097
I have the body cam.

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.013
Did you
see what's on it?

01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:56.496
No. It's encrypted.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.804
Okay, um, listen to me.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:04.330
I'm gonna give you an address.

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:06.376
Bring it here, and we can
take care of this together.

01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:10.554
I can help you, both of you.

01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.686
Please, just let me help you.

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:13.600
Before that,

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:17.169
something I wanna ask you.

01:10:18.953 --> 01:10:19.824
Anything.

01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:27.005
Tell me why I left.

01:10:28.876 --> 01:10:31.531
Tell me what happened
my last night.

01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:33.533
Oh, come on, we both
know that that's just-

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.230
The truth.

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:38.843
Pam, I need to hear it from you.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.679
A trigger-happy cop

01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:50.202
who probably shouldn't
have had a badge

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.856
in the first place
shot an innocent man.

01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.641
Ruined a promising career,

01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:59.255
and it was swept under
the rug because of optics.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:01.692
Is that what you wanna hear?

01:11:11.179 --> 01:11:13.443
Okay, what's the address?

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:14.922
552 Horner Avenue.

01:11:17.447 --> 01:11:19.884
Okay,
I'll be there soon.

01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:24.758
He's on his way.

01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:25.759
He knows?

01:11:27.979 --> 01:11:32.375
He knows.

01:12:29.519 --> 01:12:30.998
Jesus, Hatton.

01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:33.610
Sure,
it's all him, right?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.962
You're just his
commander.

01:12:39.746 --> 01:12:41.705
You know what? You
talk too fuckin' much.

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:42.923
Loose ends later.

01:13:07.687 --> 01:13:10.298
Is this
what you had in mind?

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:14.825
Helping me, helping Chris?

01:13:14.912 --> 01:13:16.261
For what it's
worth, I'm sorry.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:19.003
This is bigger than both of you.

01:13:21.353 --> 01:13:23.355
I might not be able
to help, Detective,

01:13:23.442 --> 01:13:24.704
but I can still hurt you.

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:25.749
So be quiet.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.164
Last chance, Christopher.

01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:20.951
I know.

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:22.518
It can still
end better than this.

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:23.475
Just give me the camera.

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:24.432
You can go anywhere.

01:15:26.304 --> 01:15:28.524
How'd it ever
get like this, Pam?

01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:30.047
Was it like this when
my dad was around?

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:31.004
Did he know?

01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:34.268
Your dad knew the
way the world works.

01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:35.835
He didn't like it, but he knew.

01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:39.317
I made him a promise,

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:40.144
and I broke it.

01:15:41.232 --> 01:15:42.233
I couldn't protect Ken.

01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:45.105
I can keep my promise with you.

01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:47.934
Please, Christopher.

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:49.066
So that's it then.

01:15:50.502 --> 01:15:52.678
You're gonna let that
piece of shit walk,

01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:54.419
and the bodies
continue to pile up

01:15:54.506 --> 01:15:56.073
as long as you stay
behind your desk

01:15:57.378 --> 01:15:59.380
while the optics last.

01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:01.078
You never understood,

01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:02.166
not from day one.

01:16:04.037 --> 01:16:05.299
Regret is useless.

01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:07.737
This! This is necessary!

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:09.086
Even the brutality, I can,

01:16:09.173 --> 01:16:10.304
I can guide it,

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:11.741
point it at the right target.

01:16:14.918 --> 01:16:16.180
No matter who's in the way.

01:16:36.243 --> 01:16:37.854
You know, I have one regret.

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:39.290
In all this confusion,

01:16:39.377 --> 01:16:41.553
I never got to
finish your seminar.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.336
Enough of your
bullshit, Hatton.

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:43.816
No more games.

01:16:43.903 --> 01:16:45.339
Play all the
fuckin' games I want.

01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:53.173
Fuck you.

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:58.744
This was your plan?

01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:01.834
A fuckin' toy?

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:07.361
Do you have any idea what
you're standing up against?

01:17:09.929 --> 01:17:12.323
Any idea what's at stake?

01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:15.718
You think 'cause
you quit your job,

01:17:15.805 --> 01:17:16.893
you quit your duty,

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.981
that you can look down on us?

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:19.243
On me?

01:17:21.506 --> 01:17:22.376
Hatton, the camera!

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:24.030
Yes, Ma'am!

01:17:24.117 --> 01:17:24.988
Move.

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:27.251
Just make it quick.

01:17:29.906 --> 01:17:31.951
Blue
means dead, right?

01:17:36.695 --> 01:17:37.740
Fuckin' piece of shit.

01:17:46.139 --> 01:17:46.836
It's far enough.

01:18:25.483 --> 01:18:26.310
Listen to that.

01:18:27.877 --> 01:18:28.791
That's you.

01:18:28.878 --> 01:18:30.227
Shut up.

01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:31.141
What's wrong?

01:18:32.272 --> 01:18:34.013
This is what you wanted.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.319
I never wanted this.

01:18:35.406 --> 01:18:37.277
It's necessary.

01:18:37.364 --> 01:18:38.235
You don't understand.

01:18:38.322 --> 01:18:39.323
You keep saying that,

01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:43.109
but you betrayed everything

01:18:43.196 --> 01:18:45.329
and everyone you
said you'd protect.

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.245
Piece of shit.

01:18:48.332 --> 01:18:49.637
Waited all night to do this.

01:19:08.221 --> 01:19:10.876
Come on! Get up,
you piece of shit.

01:20:11.371 --> 01:20:12.285
Hey, Chris!

01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:17.508
You know, my first
day on the job,

01:20:17.595 --> 01:20:19.336
I had a beer with your dad.

01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:21.425
I liked him.

01:20:23.644 --> 01:20:24.863
Your brother, not so much.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:27.648
Chris.

01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:31.087
Oh, come out, Bud.

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:36.092
Just wanna finish what
we started.

01:20:40.009 --> 01:20:41.532
Come on, Buddy!

01:20:41.619 --> 01:20:43.664
I'm only gonna bash
your fuckin' head in.

01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:43.899
Come on!

01:22:58.408 --> 01:22:59.191
You're gonna pay

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.107
for all of it.

01:23:11.856 --> 01:23:15.991
You and
your fuckin' toys.

01:23:25.261 --> 01:23:30.048
Drop it, both of you!

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.311
You know,

01:23:32.398 --> 01:23:34.096
you think you're gonna
put an end to all this,

01:23:34.183 --> 01:23:34.792
but you're not.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.839
This started way before you.

01:23:38.926 --> 01:23:40.450
It's gonna end way after,

01:23:42.582 --> 01:23:46.456
'cause you're just a
piece of shit.

01:23:46.543 --> 01:23:50.634
And guys like me will
always be necessary.

01:23:52.505 --> 01:23:53.419
You're afraid of
everyone on the other side

01:23:53.506 --> 01:23:54.768
of that blue line.

01:23:55.813 --> 01:23:56.901
That's what you think.

01:23:58.381 --> 01:24:00.252
I said drop it, Hatton!

01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:45.384
Ken would be proud, Chris.

01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:46.124
So would your dad.

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:49.823
I hope so.

01:24:58.441 --> 01:24:59.920
It's gonna be okay.

01:25:11.758 --> 01:25:13.282
What
constitutes a threat?

01:25:14.761 --> 01:25:15.893
Is it a person?

01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:19.679
Is it a weapon?
