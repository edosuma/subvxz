it's time to get up.

01:24.168 --> 01:27.796
[soft music]

01:28.714 --> 01:31.133
[mother] Jaywon, let's go,
we need to get ready for school.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.971
Come on now, I don't
have time to fight with you.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.689
[soft music]

02:01.288 --> 02:02.456
[mother] You want milk or juice?

02:04.291 --> 02:05.292
Juice.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.377
- Juice what?
- Juice, please.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.424
You're going to have to get
yourself home from school again,

02:12.508 --> 02:14.384
today and tomorrow,
I have got to work late again.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.179
But I promise
I'll pick you up on Friday

02:17.262 --> 02:18.555
and we'll do something
after school,

02:18.639 --> 02:21.517
probably go to the park
or something, ok?

02:26.355 --> 02:27.814
Look, Jay.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.693
I know it's a new neighborhood,
and it's new kids,

02:31.902 --> 02:33.278
you don't know one from another,

02:34.446 --> 02:36.031
but you have
to make you some friends, baby.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.283
You hear me?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.578
Alright, you're going to
make me come into your school

02:41.662 --> 02:43.830
in my house shoes and my robe on
and embarrass you.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.628
I don't even have a robe.
But I'll get one.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.130
[mother] Let's go babe.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.218
[teacher]
So once the unit's cancelled,

02:56.301 --> 02:58.846
you multiply across the top,
multiply across the bottom,

02:59.221 --> 03:02.349
hundred and forty-two thousand
divided by sixteen O nine,

03:02.432 --> 03:07.688
you're going to get somewhere
right around 88 miles

03:08.063 --> 03:10.315
every one hour.
Great Scott, right?

03:11.567 --> 03:13.068
[teacher] No? Seriously?

03:14.403 --> 03:16.446
I'm getting old.
Test tomorrow,

03:16.822 --> 03:19.616
Dimensional analysis, alright?
Not only do you need to know

03:19.700 --> 03:21.076
your metric to metric
conversions,

03:21.285 --> 03:22.286
but you also need to know

03:22.369 --> 03:24.538
your imperial to metric
conversions.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.331
Remember that worksheet
that I gave you? Yeah.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.584
Not going to happen this time,
make sure they're up here,

03:28.667 --> 03:30.294
no excuses.
Questions?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.045
[student] What if
I can't study tonight, man?

03:32.754 --> 03:34.882
I've got uh...
I've got things to do.

03:35.007 --> 03:39.052
Yeah. Well... Yeah, cute.
Then you fail. I don't know.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.304
Make up your mind, man,
your future.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.597
[school bell ringing]
There it is.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.223
Go ahead,
get your stuff and go.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.727
[teacher] Come prepared
tomorrow, no excuses.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.978
[student] Hey Mr. Williams,

03:48.061 --> 03:50.564
I know you failed the game
last night, 21 to seven.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.234
[teacher] Dude, don't do that
to me man, that's rough.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.320
I'll tell you what,

03:56.403 --> 03:57.529

04:14.379 --> 04:16.048
[thud]
Oh, sorry man.

to have to go fetch it.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.469
[foreboding soft music]

04:22.429 --> 04:24.389
What? You've got
something to say?

04:25.682 --> 04:26.767
[teacher] Excuse me, gentlemen?

04:27.518 --> 04:30.354
Oh, sorry Mr. Williams.
We were just taking.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.523

some place to be, let's go.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.229
Hey, Jake One, come here,
I've got to ask you something.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.817
Where did you get that hat?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.238
Are you retarded?
I'm talking to you.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.243
Hey yo, Jerome? Jean-Marcus?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.246
Where you be getting
your head-set, yo?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.457

something to say?

05:32.583 --> 05:33.959
- Give me my hat.
- What?

05:35.169 --> 05:37.629
Come on, say it one more time,
I didn't hear you.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.464

- Monkey.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.924
Give me my hat.

You don't talk much, do you?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.313
I guess not.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.441

10:18.076 --> 10:19.411
So why did you get food?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.289
I don't know.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.208
You know, I heard
that not eating

10:24.291 --> 10:25.417
can actually make you fat.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.586
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

10:28.504 --> 10:32.758

10:32.841 --> 10:35.135

10:35.844 --> 10:37.471
Oh what?
What do you want to do now?

10:37.554 --> 10:38.972
You want to cry
in front of everybody?

10:39.681 --> 10:41.099

10:41.850 --> 10:42.893
[student 2] I got your back man.

Uh, yeah.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.285
Are you ok?

11:01.286 --> 11:03.205
You look really confused.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.082
Uh, I feel confused.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.001
- Math sucks for everybody.
- Huh?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.128
- It was a joke.
- Oh.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.172
- Sorry.
- It's ok, I'm not that funny.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.299
I think you're amazing.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.303
[Heather] I think
this is the most

11:18.387 --> 11:20.013
I've ever heard you talk before.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.598
If I keep talking
will you stay here?

11:22.933 --> 11:24.643
You're pretty funny,
you should talk more.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.645
- You think?
- Yeah.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.022
You remind me of a friend
I had before I moved here,

11:29.481 --> 11:30.649
he gave me this bracelet.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.069
So, why did you move here?

11:37.573 --> 11:38.615
My dad died.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.577
Oh. I'm sorry.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.455
[soft splash]

Leave her alone.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.756
[Roman] Oh, what are you
going to do about it, Tayshon?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.216
Leave her alone.

11:57.176 --> 12:00.262
- And my name is Jaywon.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.139
[soft thud]

12:03.015 --> 12:05.350
[Roman] What are you
going to do, monkey?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.269
[student 2] I got your back man.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.645

going to do anything.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.314

You know I live
very close to you, right?

12:21.742 --> 12:22.910
- You do?
- Yeah.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.953
I have this trampoline,
it's kind of cool.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.164
You can come over
and use it if you want to.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.584
Ah, cool. Alright.

13:04.368 --> 13:05.911
Hey, Jaywon!

13:09.289 --> 13:10.999
Ok, so, I texted my mom

13:11.083 --> 13:12.501
and she said

13:12.960 --> 13:15.295

[door slams]

13:20.050 --> 13:21.426

how hard I fucking work

13:47.369 --> 13:49.413
to kick your ass at school?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.751
Do it outside the school,
not in the school.

13:55.377 --> 13:56.503
Do it outside!

13:57.296 --> 13:59.047
[shouting] I'm sick of you!
Get a fucking job!

14:28.493 --> 14:30.871
Jaywon, come on!
I switched my shift!

14:31.038 --> 14:33.957
Let's go to the park

14:34.041 --> 14:35.375
Let's go have some fun!

14:36.084 --> 14:38.295
[mother] Uh, I'm so happy

14:38.795 --> 14:41.215
Be happy you don't have to worry
about work and a 12 hour shift.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.384
All you've got to do
is go to school, you come home,

14:44.468 --> 14:45.969

14:48.722 --> 14:50.349
What happened to your lip?

14:53.143 --> 14:55.646
I bit my lip at lunch, today.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.814
[giggles] You still
don't know how to chew?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.234
You eat just like your daddy.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.737
And how was school?

15:04.279 --> 15:07.241
It was... it was fine.

15:09.326 --> 15:12.120
Why is my baby smiling?

15:12.621 --> 15:16.625
Oh Lord praise that in Heaven,
my baby is smiling!

15:17.626 --> 15:19.962
Ok, ok, I'm not going
to bug you about it.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.215
I just want you to be happy.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.843
Oh, I'm so happy for you!

15:26.343 --> 15:27.970
Ok, let's go straight home.

01:04:57.356 --> 01:05:01.568
I usually walk the perimeter
at 12:00, 3:00 and 6:00.

01:05:02.486 --> 01:05:03.987
Six is when
the morning guy takes over.

01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:05.447
Right.

01:05:10.118 --> 01:05:13.455
Hank is usually a little late,
but just by a couple of minutes.

01:05:17.543 --> 01:05:18.836
Man, I know the feeling.

01:05:19.503 --> 01:05:22.381
There is nothing I would like
more than a cigarette right now.

01:05:23.257 --> 01:05:24.466
But I can't.

01:05:25.843 --> 01:05:28.387
- Ten days, so far.
- Hm!

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:32.015
Yeah, you'd think it will be
the booze or the cigarettes

01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:33.559
that will take
a toll on your heart.

01:05:34.226 --> 01:05:35.310
But it's not.

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:37.396
It's women.

01:05:38.397 --> 01:05:43.652
- They get you in the end.
- Oh yeah, I hear you. No doubt.

01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:52.202
Well, you're young enough.
You should do ok.

01:05:55.747 --> 01:05:56.874
That's about it.

01:05:58.417 --> 01:05:59.877
The office is right over here.

01:06:01.336 --> 01:06:02.713
All the numbers are on the wall.

01:06:04.548 --> 01:06:08.093
Hank likes a decaf, and myself,
I like the real thing.

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:11.180
[Sam] I like to keep things
in order out here.

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:13.974
When will you be back?

01:06:14.266 --> 01:06:15.267
Not sure.

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:18.020
Maybe I'll check on you
in a couple of weeks.

01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:21.440
Not everybody likes working
the graveyard shifts.

01:06:23.775 --> 01:06:24.985
Never tried it.

01:06:25.235 --> 01:06:27.988
Figured I needed something
to pass the nights.

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:30.073
[Sam] You'll find out
real quick if it's for you.

01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:32.910
Some people
don't like the isolation,

01:06:34.453 --> 01:06:35.787
makes them crazy.

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:39.875
[Sam] Me? It helps me
collect my thoughts.

01:06:40.584 --> 01:06:41.627
Sounds good to me.

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:44.755
Alright then. Got the numbers?

01:06:44.838 --> 01:06:46.089
Yeah, got it.

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:52.888

[restless fast music]

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:15.924
[grunts] I don't know,
I think she overdosed.

01:10:17.259 --> 01:10:18.760
I don't--
I can't get to her.

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:24.975
[music continues]
[window crushes]

01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:33.525

01:10:45.287 --> 01:10:47.915
[frantic music]

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:04.348
She's going to be dead
by the time--

01:11:04.431 --> 01:11:06.725
[ghostly music]

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.197

01:12:11.748 --> 01:12:13.834
[car approaching]

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.977
Morning.
You must be the new guy.

01:12:32.227 --> 01:12:33.854
That's me. Kenny.

01:12:35.355 --> 01:12:37.107
It's good to have someone
on the night shift again,

01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:38.483
it's been a while.

01:12:39.902 --> 01:12:41.320
Been a while?
What about Sam?

01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:44.489
[Hank] Sam?
How do you know about him?

01:12:44.823 --> 01:12:46.450
He used to work the night shift,

01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:49.828
what's it been,
probably seven years or more.

01:12:49.912 --> 01:12:51.830
[giggles] Seven years!

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:55.250
Yeah. He had a heart attack
one night and died

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:57.127
when a young woman
killed herself on a ship.

01:12:57.419 --> 01:12:59.213
- A young woman?
- Yep.

01:12:59.755 --> 01:13:02.090
In a maroon Grand Prix,
right over there.

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.136
It's funny,
'cause he always used to say

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.263
that it was the cigarettes
and booze that would get him.

01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:11.892
- Yeah.
- We'd go through a lot of guys,

01:13:11.975 --> 01:13:13.477
but you're good, right? I mean,

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.604
not everyone can handle
the graveyard shift, you know.

01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:18.899
Most of them quit
after the first night.

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:22.277
It takes a special breed,
I think.

01:13:24.655 --> 01:13:27.574
It's not always like this?
The first night?

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.535
Like what?

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:32.287
Nothing.
I'll see you at six.

01:13:32.871 --> 01:13:35.123
Alright man. Get some sleep.

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:43.257
