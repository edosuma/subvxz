It's riddled with pipes.

Oh, I'm good.
Thank you, Mrs. Jay's Mom.

-Oof, my goof.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.472
and get our friend Steve
some fresh almond milk and lemonade?

-Room temp.
-You got it.

[chuckles]

01:09.819 --> 01:11.738
Steve, do you ever get lonely?

01:11.821 --> 01:14.282
Of course not. I remain lonely.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.992
It would be so nice

if I had a man like you
to keep me company

01:23.875 --> 01:26.586
Yeah, Gary used to come over
while my dad was away

-do push-ups on my mom.

with your mother.

with those yogurt balloons

just go on a date with Devin,

with Jay's Mom off the table,

09:14.971 --> 09:19.058
which is kind of a bummer
because I was really more than anything

09:19.141 --> 09:21.519
-looking forward to being your Gary.
-My Gary?

09:21.602 --> 09:22.812
You know, a Gary.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.023
A nice man who comes to your house,
makes your mommy happy,

09:26.107 --> 09:28.818
-and then hangs out with you.
-Hangs out and then what?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.820
Talks about how cool it was
to blast my mom?

09:30.903 --> 09:33.573
No, a Gary plays catch with you

09:33.656 --> 09:36.409
and gives you illegal fireworks.

09:36.492 --> 09:37.827
Wow, wait, really?

09:37.910 --> 09:40.246
Having a Gary
actually sounds kind of nice.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.289
You know what?

09:41.372 --> 09:45.835
Why don't you tell your friend
that it's okay to have sex with Jay's Mom.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.587
What are you talking about? You lost me.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.756
Listen, I'm saying I don't love
everything about this situation,

09:50.840 --> 09:53.676
but if it gets me a Gary,
let's give it a shot.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.760
Hot dog!

09:54.844 --> 09:58.723
My friend Coach Steve, who is me,
is going to do sex on a lady.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.351
What you gonna do with this big bottle
of ginkgo biloba?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.395
-Dump it off an overpass?
-Good call. [gasps]

10:04.478 --> 10:06.647
Excuse me, young lady.
You wanna tell me what's going on?

10:06.731 --> 10:08.274
-Shit!
-You did not pay for any of that.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.651
-Oh, God!
-I am so sorry.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.862
-I'll never do it again.
-I'd hope not.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.697
My parents are going through a divorce.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.115
-Oh, I know.
-Excuse me?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.534
You're little Jesse Glaser, right?
I saw it coming.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.661
Your mom's double down
on her Klonopin, first of all.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.081
Who is this gossipy ass pharmacist?

10:24.165 --> 10:27.376
And then your dad, on June 8th,
stopped refilling his Viagra.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.503
So at first,
I thought it was a good thing.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.756
Like, they took a sex class,
but then I realized,

10:31.839 --> 10:34.759
no, he's just giving up.
He doesn't want to use his penis anymore.

10:34.842 --> 10:35.968
-Not with your mother.
-Jesus.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.012
Stop! I don't wanna think
about Daddy's sad boners.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.348
What's the deal with that kid
in your school, DeVon?

10:40.431 --> 10:42.266
Because he came
and he bought a case of Ensure.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.518
He told me it's for his grandmother,
but I look at him,

10:44.602 --> 10:47.104
I'm, like, I don't know.
I think he might secretly be an old man.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.190
Yeah, I've heard that too.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.858
Are you gonna call the cops?

10:50.941 --> 10:52.860
No, but I am gonna call your dad
to pick you up.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.196
[softly] I think your mom's
on too much Klonopin to drive.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.389
His butt cheeks are so pale!

18:19.515 --> 18:21.892
-Guys, shut up! Don't be assholes.
-[yowls]

18:21.975 --> 18:24.019
-Nicholas, you are not alone.
-Oh, no.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.354
I am with you, son.

18:26.021 --> 18:26.855
Here you go.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.358
[boy] His penis isn't very big either.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.194
Mwah!

18:32.361 --> 18:33.612
[woman moans]

18:33.695 --> 18:35.948
Steve, I want you inside of me.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.493
Oh, right, yeah.
The choo-choo train goes in the tunnel.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.579
Wait a minute, where is you sweetie?
I thought it was on the front.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.208
-Oh, right. You're a naive gentleman.
-Uh-huh.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.168
-You've never done this before.
-No way.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.045
Do you need me to show you
where it is?

18:50.129 --> 18:50.963
Yes, please.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.173
-[softly] It's underneath.
-Okie-dokie.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.718
-So, where do I...
-Nope. That's my leg.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.095
Okay, how do I...

18:58.762 --> 19:01.473
All right, here comes the choo-choo train.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.225
No, that's my other leg.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.310
No! Do you want...

19:05.394 --> 19:06.979
-What do I want?
-You need some help.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.148
Yeah, I wish I had eyes on my pener,

19:09.231 --> 19:11.692
but the doctor removed them
when I was four.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.193
Here, darling.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.820
It's so warm.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.738
Should it be that warm?

19:17.114 --> 19:19.908
Oh, wow, choo-choo! I'm doing it!

19:19.992 --> 19:22.161
-Yes, you are.
-Yeah, I am.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.913
-Yeah, you are.
-I just said that I am. Jesus.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.250
[groans]
I can feel a charlie horse coming on.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.796
No, wait!
I think my pener has to make a kaka.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.131
[groans]

19:34.214 --> 19:36.258
I think I'm gonna make thick!

19:36.341 --> 19:38.677
[grunting]

19:38.760 --> 19:39.678
[train hissing]

19:39.761 --> 19:43.932
Thank you! I'm sorry!
Thank you! I'm sorry!

19:44.016 --> 19:45.559
[Jay] Ow, my nuts!

19:45.642 --> 19:48.103
-Ow, my nuts and butt!
-[exhales]

19:48.228 --> 19:50.147
Let's go Mets.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.275
If supporting your son
in his darkest hour is a crime,

19:53.358 --> 19:54.902
well, I guess you should arrest me.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.362
Yeah, that's precisely
what we're doing, Dad.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.572
So, get in the car.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.617
My husband was only exposing himself
out of love.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.535
Mom, can you just let them
take dad to jail?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.579
-I need to go home.
-Of course, sweetheart.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.664
[man 1] You know what they do
to perverts in prison?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.499
[both chuckling]

20:09.583 --> 20:11.084
[man 1] They give them jobs.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.172
I'm surprised
you're not all over that kid.

20:15.255 --> 20:19.718
Yeah, his parents
have given him such high self-esteem.

20:19.801 --> 20:23.555
Besides, I'm more interested
in the game these two are playing.

20:23.639 --> 20:27.643
You ruined my first date, Andrew!
Why wouldn't you just, like, pants me?

20:27.726 --> 20:28.894
I get a little shy

20:28.977 --> 20:31.772
when it comes to aggressively
removing someone else's clothes.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.357
Oh, my God!

20:33.440 --> 20:35.442
You're such a nerd, but not the cool way

20:35.525 --> 20:37.611
like when good-looking people
wear glasses.

20:37.694 --> 20:38.862
You're like a nobody.

20:38.946 --> 20:43.617
-Yes, this little oil drum gets ya.
-I think I can work with this.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.119
You suck, Andrew,
whatever your last name is!

20:46.203 --> 20:48.163
My last name is Glouberman.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.916
Glouberman? Ew! Perfect!

20:50.999 --> 20:54.419
-I know. It's a stupid name.
-That's the stupidest name I ever heard!

20:54.503 --> 20:56.588
It has dumb letters in it,
so it must suck, right?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.131
Yeah, it sucks so hard.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.218
Oh, man. All this verbal abuse
is making my nips hard.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.177
[laughs]

21:02.261 --> 21:04.763
Yeah, I'm a worthless boring nobody.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.682
You're actually worse than a nobody,

21:06.765 --> 21:09.559
because you're just a disgusting,
slimy, little worm.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.061
Come here, you big block.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.146
[both moaning]

21:13.230 --> 21:15.274
[Hormone barking]

21:15.357 --> 21:18.277
Wait. Say something mean
about how clammy my hands are.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.946
I'm gonna wring you out like a sponge!

21:21.029 --> 21:22.531
You're a sociopath.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.408
-[both moaning]
-[evil laughter]

21:24.491 --> 21:26.493
That's dandy.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.788
-[Shame monster laughs]
-[hormone monster howling]

21:30.872 --> 21:33.542
An almond palmer for our guest,

21:33.625 --> 21:36.295
and for my son,
a glass of cotton candy brandy.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.088
Wait, how old are you, Jay?

21:38.171 --> 21:40.048
That's a great question, Mom. I'm 13.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.633
-Oh, okay.
-Party wolves!

21:41.717 --> 21:43.427
This is nice, right?

21:43.510 --> 21:45.095
This is very nice.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.805
You're the man, Steve.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.307
I can't believe it.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.767
I actually made thick in the warm.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.854
-Looks like my job here is done.
-What do you mean, Rick?

21:53.937 --> 21:56.940
You had sex, baby.
I have nothing more to teach you.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.859
And my last wish...
[breathes deeply]

21:58.942 --> 22:00.360
...is to set you free.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.070
What? I love this dude,

22:02.154 --> 22:04.781
but he thinks I'm a genie, man.
That's crazy.

22:04.865 --> 22:09.036
Look at us, having a home cooked meal
prepared by a beautiful lady

22:09.119 --> 22:11.288
with my best friend, who's a child,

22:11.371 --> 22:13.957
and Coach Steve,
who is me, who is a Gary.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.626
-To Garys.
-To Garys!

22:18.628 --> 22:20.881
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Oh!

22:20.964 --> 22:23.675
-What's up?
-I got some good news and some bad news.

22:23.759 --> 22:27.387
The good news is,
Coach Steve did sex on a lady.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.306
Oh! Okay, so what's the bad news?

22:29.389 --> 22:32.225
This is my swan song, baby.
I'm retiring.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.729
What? Don't I still need you
for like puberty and everything?

22:35.812 --> 22:38.774
Don't worry, man.
I'll always be right here.

22:38.857 --> 22:39.941
-In my heart?
-No!

22:40.025 --> 22:42.778
I'll always be right here in my body.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.072
This is me over here. I'm me, baby.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.490
If you need me, call me.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.909
Don't call me,
but if you need me, call me.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.702
Um, okay. Bye, Rick.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.245
[Rick] What are you gonna do?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.375
And shoplifting? Seriously, Jesse,

22:56.458 --> 22:59.419
-what the hell is wrong with you?
-How are you mad at me for shoplifting

22:59.503 --> 23:01.922
and you're not mad at mom
for scissoring our cantor?

23:02.005 --> 23:04.883
Hey! Do not talk about
your mother like that, young lady.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.343
Why? She sucks!

23:06.426 --> 23:08.762
-She doesn't suck.
-Why are you defending her?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.430
Because she's my wife, Jesse.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.015
So what? She cheated on you!

23:12.099 --> 23:14.059
I still love her. How about that?

23:14.142 --> 23:15.685
-You, do?
-Yes.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.687
Why do you think I'm staying
in the basement?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.773
-I don't know.
-'Cause he got bad credit?

23:19.856 --> 23:21.566
So I can be close to you and your mom.

23:21.650 --> 23:26.446
She's the coolest lady I ever met,
and I blew it, Jesse.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.032
Oh, no! Crying daddy is scary.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.118
Jesus, I mean, I haven't worked in years.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.286
I stop trying to be physical
with your mom.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.289
-He's talking about his dick pills!
-I got kicked out that hacky-sack league

23:36.373 --> 23:38.166
for calling out their bullshit politics.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.669
You know what? I do not regret that.
Fuck those guys.

23:40.752 --> 23:41.837
[panting]

23:41.920 --> 23:43.839
But I do regret
taking your mom for granted.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.340
Oh, man. dad.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.884
-I'm sorry, you have to see this.
-No, I'm sorry.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.804
-[sniffles] I love you, kiddo.
-I love you too, dad.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.683
The thing about that league is they care
more about their sacred rules

23:54.766 --> 23:56.184
-than the hack.
-That's fucked up.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.978
It is fucked up. Dale's a dick.

23:59.020 --> 23:59.855
[doorbell rings]

23:59.938 --> 24:03.775
Baba ganoush. I wish I hadn't dropped
the rest of this Edible Arrangement.

24:03.859 --> 24:07.112
Oh, well. Gotta hope Mrs. Jay's Mom
likes honey dew.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.531
-[door opens]
-Coach Steve. What are you doing here?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.950
I thought I'd come by
and be a Gary some more.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.493
No, not today.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.079
My dad came home early
from Kid Rock's lake house.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.748
I guess Ted Nugent shot a bunch of dogs.
It was a whole thing.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.168
Oh, yeah. You're dad's home. Right.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.212
When my daddy was home,
Gary couldn't be there either.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.173
-So I get it.
-You think you're gonna be okay?

24:26.256 --> 24:30.427
Yeah, of course.
And, hey, no matter what happens,

24:30.510 --> 24:32.596
I'll always be your Gary.

24:33.346 --> 24:35.765
Hey, Steve,
whatever happened to your Gary?

24:35.849 --> 24:39.352
He locked me in the car with him
and shot his brains out of his head.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.104
Bye, Jay! See you in school.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.398
Holy shit.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.942
I can't believe that guy fucked my mom.
