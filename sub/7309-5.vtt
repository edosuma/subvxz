WEBVTT

00:03.626 --> 00:06.894
It's a great neighborhood.
Very quiet, very private.

00:06.918 --> 00:09.691
There's an oversized
backyard, that's a big plus.

00:09.715 --> 00:12.577
Whole house has been newly renovated.
There are upgrades all over the place.

00:12.601 --> 00:16.210
Stainless appliances,
air purification system,

00:16.235 --> 00:18.992
total move-in condition.

00:19.069 --> 00:23.746
The furniture is rented, but if you like
it, I can have the company make you a deal.

00:26.228 --> 00:27.778
Amy, you are going to love the kitchen,

00:27.802 --> 00:30.079
but first I'm going to show
you guys the living room.

00:30.103 --> 00:33.646
It has a wall-mounted flat
screen and a gas log fireplace.

00:33.670 --> 00:35.831
You won't believe how easy this is.

00:35.855 --> 00:38.500
One push of a button...

00:39.211 --> 00:40.816
Isn't that cozy?

01:38.101 --> 01:40.711
Make sure you capture
the back of his head, too.

01:40.735 --> 01:43.099
- If you would be so kind.
- You got it.

01:44.191 --> 01:44.689
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.441
There's no rush, gentlemen.

01:46.465 --> 01:49.399
Our patient isn't going anywhere.

01:51.222 --> 01:53.250
I don't know, Ducky,
the old Gibbs is back.

01:53.274 --> 01:54.974
The old Gibbs?

01:54.998 --> 01:56.678
McGee, over here.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.353
Hands and knees. On the floor.

01:59.855 --> 02:01.414
Okay, um...

02:01.523 --> 02:03.504
You're not going to step on me, are you?

02:04.678 --> 02:06.009
Footprints.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.939
Footprints...

02:10.398 --> 02:11.791
It's a pretty tight weave.

02:11.815 --> 02:13.026
Looks like sisal.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.304
It's a naturally stiff fiber woven
from the leaf of a cactus plant.

02:16.328 --> 02:18.941
It doesn't mat, trap dust, build static.

02:18.965 --> 02:20.539
Makes it ideal for carpeting.

02:20.563 --> 02:24.178
Personally, I prefer a good shag.

02:26.773 --> 02:30.460
From a criminal-investigative
standpoint.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.051
I don't see any dirty footprints.

02:32.075 --> 02:34.828
I think it's safe to
assume that our friend

02:34.852 --> 02:37.978
didn't stroll in here on his own.

02:40.267 --> 02:42.230
You look happy to see me, boss.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.365
Oh, the coffee.

02:46.576 --> 02:49.576
Ran the military ID our
local LEO's got off the body.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.363
Lance Corporal James Finn.
Stationed at Quantico.

02:52.387 --> 02:55.132
Went UA when his unit was
shipped to Iraq six months ago.

02:55.156 --> 02:57.759
Looks like he's got a pretty
good reason for not showing.

02:57.783 --> 02:59.256
Find out where he was buried.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.669
It won't be far, McGee.

03:00.693 --> 03:03.381
Had the trip been longer, some
bits would have fallen off.

03:03.405 --> 03:05.141
Okay, I'll check the backyard.

03:09.007 --> 03:11.064
Scene's not going to sketch itself.

03:11.653 --> 03:13.003
Ow!

03:13.339 --> 03:16.027
Perhaps it would be better if you
fetched the gurney, Mr. Palmer.

03:16.051 --> 03:18.136
I've seen all I need to see here.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.406
Yes, Doctor.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.898
It's a tidy crime scene.

03:24.922 --> 03:25.773
Quite.

03:25.797 --> 03:27.695
It appears to be a body drop.

03:27.719 --> 03:28.938
A tertiary crime scene,

03:28.962 --> 03:31.555
or quaternary, or
quinary... I could go on.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.391
Oh, you did.

03:35.147 --> 03:37.111
It's an odd decorating choice.

03:37.135 --> 03:40.068
Although the corpse does give
the place a certain lived-in look.

03:40.092 --> 03:43.551
You can see he brushed
the dirt off his face.

03:46.146 --> 03:47.055
Oh, geez!

03:47.079 --> 03:48.344
Hello.

03:48.377 --> 03:49.107
Sorry...

03:49.131 --> 03:51.255
Nicrophorus americanus.

03:51.279 --> 03:54.220
Also known as "the carrion beetle."

03:54.894 --> 03:57.147
In here, you little monkey.

03:57.578 --> 03:59.107
Yes.

03:59.368 --> 04:02.140
A reminder that
Shakespeare got it wrong.

04:02.164 --> 04:06.585
We are not food for worms. It's the
flies and beetles that feast upon us.

04:06.609 --> 04:08.845
I'm more interested in why
someone did this, Doctor.

04:08.869 --> 04:12.470
Then I'll have to research
the predatory, manipulative,

04:12.494 --> 04:14.853
grandiose nature of this behavior.

04:14.877 --> 04:18.759
But my first impression is that
we're dealing with a complete loon.

04:20.206 --> 04:23.054
That Masters in psych is
starting to pay off, Ducky.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.747
Merciful God in Heaven.

04:25.771 --> 04:27.547
I have seen a lot of
things selling real estate,

04:27.571 --> 04:30.127
but can you imagine
walking in, seeing that?

04:30.151 --> 04:31.680
When was the last time you were here?

04:31.704 --> 04:34.101
Yesterday morning. First showing.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.834
And everything was normal?

04:35.858 --> 04:39.138
There was no rotting corpsein the
living room, if that's what you mean.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.708
Who else had access?

04:40.732 --> 04:42.667
A couple of dozen real estate women.

04:42.691 --> 04:45.304
The keys are in a lock
box on the front door.

04:45.328 --> 04:45.992
Who's the owner?

04:46.016 --> 04:48.043
A local contractor...

04:48.247 --> 04:49.399
and me.

04:49.471 --> 04:52.386
Uh, I buy and Bob fixes.
We split the profits.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.154
Bob?

04:53.178 --> 04:55.267
Robert Whitehead, the contractor.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.001
A number where he can be reached?

04:57.025 --> 04:58.092
Yeah.

04:58.587 --> 05:00.954
So who put the body here, you or Bob?

05:01.270 --> 05:02.839
Neither of us.

05:02.863 --> 05:05.852
Though it is an empty house. If you're
looking to ditch a body, that's a real plus.

05:05.876 --> 05:07.113
Jody.

05:07.137 --> 05:09.157
I came as fast as I could. You okay?

05:09.181 --> 05:10.484
That's my husband I called him.

05:10.508 --> 05:11.508
Just...

05:11.629 --> 05:13.339
duck under the tape, Rick.

05:13.363 --> 05:14.411
Stop.

05:14.435 --> 05:15.937
It's a crime scene.

05:15.961 --> 05:18.271
- Crime scene? Honey, you all right?
- She's fine.

05:18.295 --> 05:21.935
I am not fine. I had to
cancel my 1:00 showing.

05:21.968 --> 05:24.007
Think I found where he was buried.

05:24.031 --> 05:27.434
Checked for footprints, but it rained last
night, so everything's pretty washed out.

05:27.458 --> 05:28.226
You got access?

05:28.250 --> 05:30.251
There's side access at street level.

05:30.275 --> 05:33.320
Chain link fence around the yard, but
any one with gloves could have scaled it.

05:33.344 --> 05:34.892
Wait for me!

05:36.668 --> 05:38.594
The real estate agent
solve the big mystery?

05:38.618 --> 05:41.079
No, but she owns the
property with a contractor

05:41.103 --> 05:43.819
and every real estate
agent in town had access.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.643
I meant the mystery of how they
expect to sell a house for 600 grand

05:46.667 --> 05:48.912
when it only has two
and a half bathrooms.

05:48.936 --> 05:51.802
Well, you know what they
say: Location, location...

05:51.826 --> 05:53.432
location.

05:53.456 --> 05:56.258
So, judging from the
marks around the edges,

05:56.282 --> 05:58.461
looks like the digger
used a garden spade.

05:58.485 --> 06:02.932
The soil's not real packed, so it would have
been easy digging for a male or a female.

06:03.024 --> 06:03.895
You see that?

06:03.919 --> 06:05.326
Black plastic bags.

06:05.350 --> 06:06.210
Garbage bags.

06:06.234 --> 06:07.716
Body bag.

06:08.212 --> 06:09.818
Get it back to Abby, and a soil sample.

06:09.842 --> 06:11.616
I want ground-penetrating radar.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.978
Uh, boss, those techs are
booked weeks in advance.

06:15.747 --> 06:18.652
I'm going to tell them it's an emergency
and I will not budge until they show.

06:18.676 --> 06:20.300
- Who's staying with McGee?
- I can.

06:20.324 --> 06:22.409
If you want Tony to check out
the other real estate women.

06:22.433 --> 06:23.266
Fine with me.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.678
Tony, stay with McGee.

06:27.339 --> 06:30.205
You shouldn't have licked
your chops like a hungry wolf.

06:41.031 --> 06:42.175
Much better.

06:42.199 --> 06:44.151
Before I smelled like dirt and sweat.

06:44.175 --> 06:46.130
Now I smell like dirt, sweat...

06:46.154 --> 06:47.871
and sandalwood.

06:48.347 --> 06:49.086
Good morning.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.509
What are you doing at my desk?

06:50.533 --> 06:52.222
Couldn't find my
deodorant, so I used yours.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.390
No, you didn't.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.963
Yeah, we're partners.
What's the big deal?

06:54.987 --> 06:56.460
A hair!

06:57.265 --> 06:59.850
Come on, you attach
electrodes to men's testicles.

06:59.874 --> 07:01.658
You getting squeamish about a hair?

07:01.682 --> 07:02.769
I'm not going to feel bad.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.425
Those ground radar techs
didn't show till dawn.

07:05.449 --> 07:07.910
McGee and I watched
the sunrise together.

07:08.218 --> 07:10.378
It was very Brokeback Mountain.

07:10.892 --> 07:12.202
He had me at "howdy."

07:12.226 --> 07:13.582
How romantic. I'm sorry I missed it.

07:13.606 --> 07:16.220
Well, I can show it
to you on my new phone

07:16.244 --> 07:17.765
it takes video.

07:18.151 --> 07:20.350
Behold the majesty of the sun.

07:20.946 --> 07:22.878
On a two-inch screen?

07:22.921 --> 07:24.055
Are we all getting those?

07:24.079 --> 07:25.857
Nope. I bought it.

07:25.881 --> 07:27.161
Expensive?

07:27.517 --> 07:28.752
Not really.

07:28.873 --> 07:30.689
Yeah, really.

07:30.713 --> 07:32.392
You've been dropping a
lot of cash lately, McGee.

07:32.416 --> 07:35.028
New phone, new watch,
new teeth. What's up?

07:35.052 --> 07:36.347
Ducky matched the dental records.

07:36.371 --> 07:39.022
The body downstairs
is Lance Corporal Finn.

07:39.046 --> 07:40.878
Ziva, when did you...?

07:40.982 --> 07:42.330
McGee...

07:42.632 --> 07:45.253
how long does it take
to put on a clean shirt?

07:45.277 --> 07:46.256
Ten seconds.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.487
With buttons, a little longer.

07:49.987 --> 07:51.584
Rhetorical question.

07:51.751 --> 07:52.706
Contractor's off the hook.

07:52.730 --> 07:54.055
He's been out of town for a week.

07:54.079 --> 07:56.113
Going to check on the real
estate agents this morning.

07:56.137 --> 07:57.243
That's all you did?

07:57.267 --> 08:00.107
No. While you and McGee
were watching the sunrise,

08:00.131 --> 08:02.614
I was pulling Lance Corporal Finn's SRB.

08:02.638 --> 08:04.958
And I would have to say it was spotty.

08:04.982 --> 08:07.023
He was Unc' on the range
and failed his swim qual.

08:07.047 --> 08:08.620
So they made him a supply clerk.

08:08.644 --> 08:10.541
Right. Six months ago, he signed out

08:10.565 --> 08:12.659
on a three-day pass
before deploying to Iraq

08:12.683 --> 08:13.902
and never returned home.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.246
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in Iraq.

08:17.656 --> 08:19.479
I'll contact MTAC.

08:19.503 --> 08:21.754
I put in a request for
Finn's bank records,

08:21.778 --> 08:23.691
earning statements and medical records.

08:23.715 --> 08:24.874
Night wasn't a total loss.

08:24.898 --> 08:27.489
Ground radar picked up a shovel
about ten feet from the gravesite.

08:27.513 --> 08:29.180
Already sent it to Abby.

08:29.905 --> 08:30.905
Yep!

08:31.020 --> 08:33.017
The old Gibbs is back.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.876
You see something, Abs?

08:34.900 --> 08:36.369
Beauty.

08:36.393 --> 08:39.859
I mean, it's tragic, but if you
were to see this tableau in a museum,

08:39.883 --> 08:42.662
you'd swear it was a brilliant
commentary on the human condition.

08:42.686 --> 08:44.938
What? Corpse staring at a TV set?

08:44.962 --> 08:48.329
- It says it all.
- Well, it doesn't say who put him there or why.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.153
That's for us to find out.

08:50.177 --> 08:52.330
You shaved your mustache.

08:52.354 --> 08:54.666
I liked you with a
little hair on your face.

08:54.690 --> 08:57.206
Still got my eyebrows. Good point.

08:57.275 --> 09:00.228
I found Finn's blood, hair and
fingerprints on the plastic.

09:00.252 --> 09:01.524
So he was probably wrapped in it.

09:01.548 --> 09:04.907
But I didn't find any other prints
on the plastic or the shovel.

09:04.931 --> 09:08.148
No chance of grabbing the
gravedigger's sweat off the handle?

09:08.172 --> 09:10.633
After being underground, it's unlikely.

09:10.657 --> 09:12.193
Strange case, huh?

09:12.217 --> 09:15.012
I had this friend once that used to
display roadkill in his living room.

09:15.036 --> 09:17.363
- He had an NEA grant...
- Abby.

09:17.387 --> 09:19.692
Um, next I analyzed the soil.

09:19.716 --> 09:22.487
It's compost material.

09:22.511 --> 09:24.627
Rocks and small sticks.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.021
Nothing's over an inch long.

09:26.045 --> 09:28.079
It would indicate that it was
processed through a screen.

09:28.103 --> 09:29.985
Pretty clean for dirt.

09:30.009 --> 09:31.296
It's a commercial product.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.145
But the house was just
re-landscaped, so it's not surprising.

09:34.169 --> 09:36.526
I sent the acidity levels to Ducky.

09:36.550 --> 09:39.104
I then inventoried
Finn's personal items.

09:39.128 --> 09:40.203
Got anything with a date on it?

09:40.227 --> 09:41.326
Nope. Sorry.

09:41.350 --> 09:44.582
No credit card or purchase
receipts. I guess he was a cash guy.

09:44.606 --> 09:48.629
I mean if you can call a
guy with $31.71 a cash guy.

09:48.653 --> 09:51.394
His clothes were Dockers
from Sears. No judgments.

09:51.418 --> 09:53.806
The shirt is a large,
the shoes are off-brand.

09:53.830 --> 09:55.865
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.

09:55.889 --> 09:57.599
Like you wear, Gibbs.

09:58.437 --> 09:59.860
You're fishin', Ab.

09:59.884 --> 10:01.482
Are they regular boxers?

10:01.506 --> 10:03.729
Trunks? Bikinis?

10:03.767 --> 10:05.033
Nothing?

10:06.134 --> 10:07.586
Mr. Palmer,

10:07.610 --> 10:11.824
have you finished the chromatographic
analysis of his volatile fatty acid?

10:11.848 --> 10:12.697
Yes, Doctor.

10:12.721 --> 10:13.685
Well, let's...

10:13.709 --> 10:15.238
plug the numbers into the computer

10:15.262 --> 10:19.352
and let's how long our friend
has been leaking into the topsoil.

10:19.376 --> 10:21.921
Agent Gibbs will be here
soon and he will ask...

10:21.945 --> 10:23.896
How'd the lance corporal die, Doctor?

10:23.920 --> 10:26.413
"How he died" may take me a while.

10:26.437 --> 10:27.876
Try, "When did he die?"

10:27.900 --> 10:29.294
That's my next question.

10:29.318 --> 10:31.578
That, I can answer.

10:32.078 --> 10:33.758
It's... a...

10:33.782 --> 10:35.432
tricky calculation.

10:35.456 --> 10:39.440
One has to factor in temperature,
soil acidity, and the...

10:39.464 --> 10:41.173
variety and volume of insects

10:41.197 --> 10:44.083
who now call Lance
Corporal Finn their home.

10:44.107 --> 10:45.431
Give me a round number.

10:45.455 --> 10:48.326
92 days, with a
three-percent margin of error.

10:52.523 --> 10:56.389
It would appear you
deserted before you died.

10:56.510 --> 10:58.845
Gibbs, Lance Corporal
Finn's fiancée's upstairs.

10:58.869 --> 11:01.717
She saw a report on the
local news last night.

11:01.978 --> 11:02.650
How, Doctor?

11:02.674 --> 11:05.786
As soon as I know, you'll know.

11:07.836 --> 11:10.269
Her name is Siri Albert.
She's 25, lives in Manassas,

11:10.293 --> 11:11.389
and works as a physical therapist.

11:11.413 --> 11:13.756
- Finn's fiancée is here. I put her in the conference room.
- You did?

11:13.780 --> 11:14.743
I did.

11:14.767 --> 11:15.761
No, I did.

11:15.785 --> 11:16.884
His fiancée?

11:16.908 --> 11:18.400
Yeah, his fiancée.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.183
Tall?

11:19.207 --> 11:20.427
Like brown hair?

11:20.451 --> 11:21.588
Red hair.

11:36.069 --> 11:38.886
Someone has made a huge mistake.

11:38.910 --> 11:42.458
James isn't dead. He's been
writing me letters from Iraq.

11:42.482 --> 11:43.430
It's a common name.

11:43.454 --> 11:46.520
The news said he was born
in Jackson, Pennsylvania.

11:46.544 --> 11:47.936
It's a small town.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.880
That James Finn has
been dead three months.

11:49.904 --> 11:51.983
He left for Iraq three months ago.

11:52.007 --> 11:54.191
I saw him the morning he went away.

11:54.215 --> 11:57.287
And I just got a letter
from him last week.

11:57.311 --> 12:01.892
He says he misses me
and he's working a lot.

12:01.916 --> 12:02.736
We'll need those.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.322
Okay, but I want them back.

12:05.714 --> 12:07.718
It's his handwriting. I recognize it.

12:07.742 --> 12:09.104
They've been coming for months.

12:09.128 --> 12:10.920
Now I want to know who
that other woman is.

12:10.944 --> 12:12.359
We're not here to talk about that.

12:12.383 --> 12:15.299
Is she saying that she's
engaged to Jimmy, too?

12:16.114 --> 12:19.715
'Cause if that's true, he better
hope he's dead, or else I'll kill him.

12:21.072 --> 12:24.462
James and I connected on
a deep, spiritual level.

12:24.486 --> 12:27.989
From then on, any time he
was in town, he was with me.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.300
How often did you see him?

12:29.324 --> 12:31.899
He would come and go a
lot. But I understood.

12:31.923 --> 12:34.167
That's how it is with Special Ops.

12:34.191 --> 12:37.973
Lance Corporal Finn's record does not indicate
he was involved with Special Operations.

12:37.997 --> 12:40.158
He said his missions were top secret.

12:40.182 --> 12:44.416
He wanted to tell me more, but he
didn't want to put me in danger.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.503
When'd you last see Lance Corporal Finn?

12:46.527 --> 12:47.724
Six months ago.

12:47.748 --> 12:48.983
Before he left for Iraq.

12:49.007 --> 12:50.075
How'd you meet?

12:50.099 --> 12:51.357
At a bar.

12:51.637 --> 12:52.396
Two years ago.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.881
I was there with some girlfriends,

12:53.905 --> 12:56.285
and when I got up to
go to the ladies' room,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.807
he blocked my path,

12:58.961 --> 13:00.708
said he couldn't keep his eyes off me.

13:00.732 --> 13:01.846
And that worked?

13:01.870 --> 13:03.142
What worked...

13:03.166 --> 13:04.936
is that when we talked...

13:04.960 --> 13:06.202
he had something to say.

13:06.226 --> 13:09.284
Most guys won't shut up
about their online war games,

13:09.308 --> 13:11.740
but this guy, he had seen real action.

13:11.764 --> 13:13.187
And I was...

13:13.211 --> 13:15.033
feeling patriotic that night...

13:15.057 --> 13:17.468
so I invited him
to come home with me.

13:17.605 --> 13:19.880
The sex was fantastic.

13:21.307 --> 13:23.829
When did you two get engaged?

13:23.943 --> 13:25.825
About a week before he left.

13:25.849 --> 13:28.055
James wanted to borrow $30,000.

13:28.079 --> 13:29.683
Did he tell you what the money was for?

13:29.707 --> 13:31.183
Gambling debts.

13:31.207 --> 13:34.076
And if he didn't pay,
they were gonna hurt him.

13:34.100 --> 13:34.949
Who?

13:34.973 --> 13:37.045
He said it was better if I didn't know.

13:37.069 --> 13:39.207
Because of the danger.

13:39.525 --> 13:42.267
Look, I didn't give him the money.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.910
I loaned it to him.

13:43.934 --> 13:46.307
So you drew up a legal document?

13:47.129 --> 13:48.122
No.

13:48.146 --> 13:50.492
But we had an oral agreement.

13:50.527 --> 13:52.576
I mean, he promised to pay me back.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.151
With interest.

13:54.710 --> 13:58.464
I mean, I maxed out all of my cards,

13:58.495 --> 14:00.604
so you better find that money.

14:00.628 --> 14:02.827
What was he like the
last time you saw him?

14:02.851 --> 14:04.794
He was sweet.

14:06.031 --> 14:08.509
We made love right before he left.

14:08.533 --> 14:09.798
He use a condom?

14:09.822 --> 14:11.614
I'm on the pill.

14:16.445 --> 14:18.419
We were engaged.

14:20.130 --> 14:23.723
Abs, can DNA still be recovered
from Lance Corporal Finn's skivvies?

14:23.747 --> 14:26.753
It would take the cooperation
of weather and protection.

14:26.777 --> 14:29.488
He was wrapped in
plastic and it's been cold

14:29.512 --> 14:31.161
, so there's a decent chance.

14:31.185 --> 14:32.209
Well, run the tests.

14:32.233 --> 14:33.927
We'll do a cheek swab on his fiancées.

14:33.951 --> 14:36.286
Wait, did you say "fiancées?"

14:36.310 --> 14:37.605
Like plural?

14:37.629 --> 14:41.282
Huh. Kinky.

14:44.335 --> 14:44.884
Is that it?

14:44.908 --> 14:45.932
For now, Siri.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.229
I need to follow you home
and pick up his belongings.

14:48.253 --> 14:51.282
I want them back when James returns.

14:52.511 --> 14:53.988
He's dead.

14:54.072 --> 14:56.392
He can't return.

14:56.589 --> 14:58.946
Lookl know he's not dead.

14:58.970 --> 15:02.036
I would feel it in my
heart. We're soul mates.

15:16.498 --> 15:17.831
No.

15:19.881 --> 15:21.077
Agent Lee.

15:21.101 --> 15:24.205
I need legal help. We have a
suspect who's refusing a cheek swab.

15:24.229 --> 15:26.337
I'll file for a DNA search
warrant. What's the name?

15:26.361 --> 15:28.636
Rebecca Kemp. I'll e-mail you the info.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.834
Listen...

15:30.001 --> 15:31.250
you miss working with us?

15:31.274 --> 15:34.190
I think the legal
department is more my speed.

15:34.349 --> 15:35.976
Why, do you miss me?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.707
Uh, sure.

15:37.771 --> 15:38.485
Boss...

15:38.509 --> 15:40.928
Agent Lee is getting us our cheek swab.

15:41.765 --> 15:44.357
Rebecca paranoid or guilty?

15:44.908 --> 15:46.082
Might just be angry.

15:46.106 --> 15:48.406
At Finn, us, the world.

15:48.430 --> 15:50.449
Go back with her to her
apartment, get Finn's stuff.

15:50.473 --> 15:52.907
And, no, I don't want to
wait for a search warrant.

15:57.761 --> 16:00.917
- I'll grab my coat. Wait at the elevator.
- Okay.

16:02.553 --> 16:03.991
Hey, you.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.236
Where's my money? Yeah, you.

16:06.260 --> 16:07.947
Did you and Jimmy spend it?

16:07.971 --> 16:10.079
Please get away from
me. I don't know you.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.818
I am Jimmy's fiancee.

16:11.842 --> 16:13.456
James loved me.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.585
He used you.

16:14.609 --> 16:16.138
You liar!

16:17.079 --> 16:17.651
Chick fight!

16:17.675 --> 16:19.407
He loved me!

16:22.487 --> 16:24.023
Get off of me!

16:24.582 --> 16:25.749
Stop it!

16:27.332 --> 16:30.127
Hey! Get off her! Get off her!

16:37.059 --> 16:38.279
Get up.

16:46.276 --> 16:48.272
How'd this guy die, Doctor?

16:48.296 --> 16:51.542
As I told you, when I know, you'll know.

16:51.566 --> 16:53.125
Know faster.

16:53.827 --> 16:57.083
Shaving off your moustache has
brought back your usual impatience.

16:57.107 --> 16:58.995
Good. Means I'm doing my job.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.362
I do have a potential cause of death.

17:01.386 --> 17:03.524
But it's by no means airtight.

17:03.548 --> 17:04.887
See this fracture?

17:04.912 --> 17:07.540
Well, yeah, you're pointing right at it.

17:07.565 --> 17:10.246
The brain revealed an epidural hematoma,

17:10.270 --> 17:12.099
verified by this CAT scan.

17:12.124 --> 17:13.554
Though it's far from massive.

17:13.578 --> 17:17.616
Statistically, it's only
fatal in about 17% of cases.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.603
Blunt-force trauma?

17:18.627 --> 17:19.589
Most likely.

17:19.614 --> 17:23.252
We're looking at a
baseball bat or a golf club,

17:23.276 --> 17:26.364
perhaps wielded by a
disgruntled fiancée.

17:26.387 --> 17:28.098
You tell me how;

17:28.348 --> 17:30.207
I'll figure out who.

17:33.781 --> 17:37.083
Intelligence has placed
La Grenouille in Nairobi.

17:37.107 --> 17:40.107
That might mean a shipment to Somalia.

17:40.639 --> 17:44.126
We'll continue to monitor these
activities. Just do your best.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.783
Mission trouble?

17:45.807 --> 17:47.231
It's need-to-know.

17:47.255 --> 17:51.399
Initiate the video conference
Special Agent Gibbs requested.

17:51.452 --> 17:54.706
Have you figured out why
somebody would unbury a body?

17:54.730 --> 17:56.199
That's need-to-know.

17:56.599 --> 17:58.683
You can't pull that one with me, Jethro.

17:58.707 --> 18:00.147
I'm your boss.

18:00.171 --> 18:02.115
Iraq standing by, ma'am.

18:03.366 --> 18:06.681
I got your e-mail concerning Lance Corporal
Finn. I assume you've been over his SRB.

18:06.705 --> 18:07.856
Yeah, we have, Skipper.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.959
We'd like to know
what's not on the record.

18:09.983 --> 18:12.988
Finn wasn't one of my stronger
Marines. Wasn't surprised he went UA.

18:13.012 --> 18:14.721
He have any enemies in the company?

18:14.745 --> 18:18.112
He was well-liked. Played poker.
Not well, but covered his debts.

18:18.136 --> 18:22.671
Liked to talk about his sexual exploits
in detail. You know how marines love that.

18:22.695 --> 18:26.762
How does a dead marine, stateside,
send letters home from Iraq?

18:26.786 --> 18:28.119
Wondered about that myself.

18:28.143 --> 18:28.873
Get over here, marine.

18:28.897 --> 18:29.897
Sir.

18:30.916 --> 18:33.719
Meet Lance Corporal Hagan,
soon to be Private Hagan.

18:34.255 --> 18:36.409
Before deployment, Finn gave him...

18:37.005 --> 18:40.041
a couple hundred bucks to pop
letters in the mail to two women.

18:40.065 --> 18:41.955
The first batch started six months ago.

18:41.979 --> 18:43.213
The second, three months later.

18:43.237 --> 18:45.580
Got enough to last the
rest of our deployment.

18:45.604 --> 18:46.695
Gonna need those.

18:46.719 --> 18:48.459
Send 'em on the next flight out.

18:51.183 --> 18:53.021
Two fiancées...

18:53.045 --> 18:54.581
That a marine thing?

18:55.850 --> 18:58.570
That's need-to-know,
too, Director.

19:01.495 --> 19:03.627
- Do you see it yet?
- No.

19:03.703 --> 19:04.846
Keep looking.

19:04.870 --> 19:06.769
Abby, I've been staring at
this thing for five minutes.

19:06.793 --> 19:09.255
I don't see anything that
I would consider to be art.

19:09.279 --> 19:10.506
But you took the picture.

19:10.530 --> 19:12.662
Just because Ducky told me to.

19:12.686 --> 19:13.468
I'm sorry.

19:13.492 --> 19:14.583
That's okay.

19:14.607 --> 19:16.648
I'm sure you find
other things beautiful.

19:16.672 --> 19:18.570
Like Gibbs breaking up a chick fight.

19:18.594 --> 19:20.853
I can't believe I missed that.

19:20.877 --> 19:22.134
Well, I've got good news.

19:22.158 --> 19:24.477
Guess what is now playing on McGee TV.

19:24.501 --> 19:26.671
I hug and kiss technology.

19:27.523 --> 19:29.384
You liar!

19:31.133 --> 19:32.737
Mee-yow.

19:32.761 --> 19:33.754
Which one's Siri?

19:33.778 --> 19:35.962
The one that Gibbs is
pulling off the other girl.

19:35.986 --> 19:38.464
It's always good to have a face
to put with genetic material.

19:38.488 --> 19:40.356
You get a match on her
off Finn's clothing?

19:40.380 --> 19:42.058
Yeah. But not just her.

19:42.082 --> 19:44.407
There was a party in Finn's pants.

19:44.464 --> 19:47.582
I found genetic material
from two distinct females.

19:47.606 --> 19:48.525
Siri and...?

19:48.549 --> 19:50.272
A mystery woman.

19:50.296 --> 19:52.781
That would explain why
Rebecca refused the cheek swab.

19:52.805 --> 19:55.268
Told us she hadn't
seen him in six months.

19:55.292 --> 19:56.507
Play it again.

19:57.386 --> 19:59.247
Plus, Rebecca's got
a lot of anger in her.

19:59.271 --> 20:01.492
Oh, I wouldn't assume Siri is innocent.

20:01.516 --> 20:02.366
Why not?

20:02.390 --> 20:03.730
Look at the fight.

20:03.754 --> 20:05.403
Siri initiates it.

20:05.427 --> 20:07.687
She may not be as sweet as she looks.

20:08.615 --> 20:09.849
This is my favorite part.

20:09.873 --> 20:11.146
Which part?

20:13.993 --> 20:16.147
I was lucky to get out of
Rebecca's apartment alive.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.817
She threw this at my head.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.475
Wow. Finn was reading Moby Dick?

20:19.499 --> 20:22.467
No, she was throwing it. I
took it so she couldn't re-arm.

20:22.491 --> 20:24.894
Okay, let's see what
he had at Siri's place.

20:24.918 --> 20:27.704
- Razor and a toothbrush.
- Razor and a toothbrush.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.498
Three pairs of white underwear.

20:29.522 --> 20:32.211
Three pairs... pinkish underwear.

20:32.235 --> 20:33.786
One black sock with a gold toe.

20:33.810 --> 20:36.349
Don't you hate it when you leave
one black sock at one fiancee's house

20:36.373 --> 20:37.765
and the other one at the other's house?

20:37.789 --> 20:39.422
One pair of blue jeans.

20:39.446 --> 20:42.271
And one black mesh T-shirt.

20:42.295 --> 20:43.620
Do women really like these?

20:43.644 --> 20:44.818
Depends on who's wearing it.

20:44.842 --> 20:46.597
- So if I...
- No.

20:47.630 --> 20:48.699
Not much to go on.

20:48.723 --> 20:51.707
Only one place left to check.

20:52.907 --> 20:54.344
Ha, ha.

20:55.030 --> 20:56.853
Tony just put his hand
in another man's pocket

20:56.877 --> 20:58.413
and it made him very happy.

20:58.437 --> 20:59.882
I found a pre-paid calling card.

20:59.906 --> 21:00.756
That's it?

21:00.780 --> 21:01.246
Yes.

21:01.270 --> 21:02.806
No engagement rings?

21:02.913 --> 21:04.299
You want those, too?

21:05.136 --> 21:08.820
I'll go to Siri's and get the ring and
any other gifts Finn might've given her.

21:08.844 --> 21:10.803
McGee, you've got Rebecca.

21:11.888 --> 21:14.194
How could they have been so clueless?

21:14.533 --> 21:17.407
Well, he's dead, so maybe they weren't.

21:19.364 --> 21:20.501
Officer David.

21:20.525 --> 21:21.895
This is Jody Carvell.

21:21.919 --> 21:24.050
I am standing outside
of the Larson Lane house.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.115
Are you aware that the
police tape is still up?

21:26.139 --> 21:28.507
Yes, it's an ongoing investigation.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.870
It's the real-estate agent.

21:29.894 --> 21:31.023
Okay, for how much longer?

21:31.047 --> 21:33.283
It costs me money every
day I can't show this house.

21:33.307 --> 21:35.118
- Yes, but I...
- This is outrageous.

21:35.142 --> 21:35.694
No, I...

21:35.718 --> 21:38.506
I would like to speak to
your supervisor, if I could.

21:38.530 --> 21:41.207
She wants to have a
word with my supervisor.

21:52.146 --> 21:53.117
Miss Kemp?

21:53.141 --> 21:55.853
It's NCIS. We need to
speak with you again.

22:06.577 --> 22:09.365
Rebecca? Rebecca, what happened?

22:10.594 --> 22:12.153
Did you call 911?

22:12.843 --> 22:14.107
Hold on.

22:16.196 --> 22:20.197
Yes, I've got a woman here who's
shot, need immediat medical attention.

22:27.977 --> 22:31.699
Why would someone unbury body?

22:31.723 --> 22:33.062
I can answer that.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.965
To send a message. Like, "Hi, I'm dead."

22:36.357 --> 22:38.677
"Never get engaged to two
women at the same time?

22:38.701 --> 22:41.307
It would be easier to
just rent a billboard.

22:41.331 --> 22:42.920
Second question.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.675
Where's the money.

22:44.699 --> 22:45.699
Ah!

22:46.290 --> 22:48.843
Maybe in Siri's engagement ring.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.983
I got to bring this down to Abby.

22:51.625 --> 22:53.854
I can save you an elevator trip.

22:55.558 --> 22:57.826
Oh, that's nice.

22:57.864 --> 22:59.573
It's creating condensation.

22:59.597 --> 23:02.159
On a real diamond, it
evaporates immediately.

23:02.491 --> 23:04.173
It's, uh, staying.

23:04.197 --> 23:06.431
Because it's a fake.

23:07.397 --> 23:09.144
Give it one more try, just to make sure.

23:09.168 --> 23:11.021
I'm not blowing on you again.

23:11.127 --> 23:12.694
Question three.

23:15.226 --> 23:16.483
"Why buy a shovel?"

23:16.507 --> 23:18.216
Oops. No. Sorry.

23:18.240 --> 23:20.266
"Why bury a shovel?"

23:20.290 --> 23:21.826
I have no answer to that.

23:21.850 --> 23:23.989
But here, how about this one?

23:27.358 --> 23:29.384
Who is Darkman?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.823
That is the question.

23:30.847 --> 23:33.417
Liam Neeson in the 1990 cult classic

23:33.441 --> 23:37.915
directed by Sam Raimi about a mentally
unstable scientist who seeks revenge.

23:37.939 --> 23:39.852
You left out "Who shot Rebecca?"

23:39.876 --> 23:41.970
That was my next question.

23:41.994 --> 23:45.466
Siri claims she was out walking at
the time of the shooting. No witnesses.

23:45.490 --> 23:47.147
GSR tests came back negative.

23:47.171 --> 23:50.003
Even if Siri shot Rebecca, I
don't think she killed Finn.

23:50.027 --> 23:52.429
I saw her face when she saw his body.

23:52.453 --> 23:55.059
If Siri's innocent, she'd
assume that Rebecca's guilty

23:55.083 --> 23:56.515
and she'd seek revenge.

23:56.539 --> 23:59.153
Shooting someone in broad
daylight is just dumb.

23:59.177 --> 24:01.926
You're not thinking like
a jealous woman, Ziva.

24:01.950 --> 24:04.156
They're keeping Rebecca
in the hospital overnight.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.711
She lost a lot of blood, but the
wound was through and through.

24:06.735 --> 24:07.675
Anything on the shooter?

24:07.699 --> 24:09.688
Said she didn't get a good look at her.

24:09.712 --> 24:10.622
How'd she know it was a her?

24:10.646 --> 24:13.652
Rebecca said she heard a
female voice at the door.

24:13.676 --> 24:15.107
When she opened it, bang.

24:15.131 --> 24:16.267
Siri?

24:16.291 --> 24:17.473
Maybe not.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.621
When I went back to
search Rebecca's place,

24:19.645 --> 24:21.693
I found this between the couch pillows.

24:21.717 --> 24:23.208
Rebecca shot herself.

24:23.232 --> 24:24.248
I think so.

24:24.272 --> 24:26.848
She lost a lot today: Her
fiancee, her life savings.

24:26.872 --> 24:28.397
Her respect.

24:28.766 --> 24:30.551
Could have been a
failed suicide attempt.

24:30.575 --> 24:31.825
Or a bid for sympathy.

24:31.849 --> 24:33.347
Or an attempt to escape discovery

24:33.371 --> 24:35.897
that she had sex with
Finn the day she died.

24:36.197 --> 24:37.819
What's your gut tell you, boss?

24:38.197 --> 24:39.368
Take your shirt off.

24:39.392 --> 24:40.770
Here we go.

24:42.120 --> 24:42.948
I know it's kind of messy.

24:42.972 --> 24:45.472
The shirt, McGee, take it off now.

25:03.842 --> 25:05.417
Take it down to Abby.

25:06.849 --> 25:09.418
Or would you rather wait
for a search warrant?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.297
Rebecca's DNA.

25:17.297 --> 25:18.688
I need to borrow one of your shirts.

25:18.712 --> 25:21.069
You afraid all that white
might burn out Abby's corneas?

25:21.093 --> 25:23.662
Do not make me walk around like
this all day. Come on. Help me out.

25:23.686 --> 25:24.429
All right.

25:24.453 --> 25:26.464
I can't resist a damsel in distress.

25:26.488 --> 25:27.760
Here, take this!

25:27.784 --> 25:29.389
I get a fresh one.

25:30.248 --> 25:32.546
Wow, it's just like Chippendale's...

25:34.597 --> 25:36.600
without the bow ties or muscles.

25:38.492 --> 25:39.173
Give me a second.

25:39.197 --> 25:41.882
I just have to finish
this e-mail to Kofi Annan.

25:41.906 --> 25:43.442
Kofi can wait.

25:44.755 --> 25:45.959
What is it, Jethro?

25:45.983 --> 25:48.197
- The Finn case.
- Yes?

25:52.629 --> 25:54.127
You're lost on this one?

25:54.151 --> 25:55.257
Puzzled.

25:55.281 --> 25:57.088
They barely knew Finn...

25:57.941 --> 26:00.750
yet they let him move
in, loaned him money.

26:00.774 --> 26:03.237
They trusted a man who
took advantage of them.

26:03.261 --> 26:05.136
If you're in a relationship
and the other person

26:05.160 --> 26:07.752
is keeping secrets, how would you know?

26:08.498 --> 26:09.296
You'd know.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.593
I didn't.

26:11.189 --> 26:12.308
Who lied to you?

26:12.332 --> 26:13.637
You did.

26:13.985 --> 26:17.616
Not exactly lied, but you just
didn't tell me the whole truth either.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.373
You're comparing me to Finn?

26:19.397 --> 26:21.058
I'm just saying that you can be involved

26:21.082 --> 26:23.362
with someone without fully knowing them.

26:23.397 --> 26:25.852
How could you not tell
me about your family?

26:26.464 --> 26:28.279
Finish your e-mail.

26:29.049 --> 26:31.595
You wanted my advice.

26:32.897 --> 26:35.973
Just don't be too hard on the fiancees.

26:35.997 --> 26:37.427
Finn duped them.

26:37.451 --> 26:39.477
And I shouldn't have
brought up the past.

26:39.501 --> 26:42.582
I know you had your reasons for
not wanting to talk about it.

26:44.632 --> 26:45.897
We're talking about it now.

26:45.921 --> 26:47.851
Now is not Paris.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.021
Your priorities were clear on Paris.

26:50.045 --> 26:52.674
I had a job to do in Europe.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.493
If I had told you about my first wife,

26:55.945 --> 26:57.889
would it have made a difference?

26:58.372 --> 27:00.073
We'll never know, will we?

27:18.861 --> 27:20.073
Yeah. Gibbs.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.422
You went home early.

27:21.446 --> 27:22.899
Stayed until 2130.

27:22.923 --> 27:24.972
That's early for you.

27:24.996 --> 27:28.073
You called to talk about
my work hours, Dr. Mallard?

27:28.097 --> 27:30.193
No, Agent Gibbs.

27:30.217 --> 27:34.691
I had a hunch which led me to trim
Lance Corporal Finn's nose hairs.

27:34.715 --> 27:37.344
I don't think he'd
done it for some time.

27:37.368 --> 27:39.755
I discovered something
under the microscope.

27:39.779 --> 27:41.903
Among the keratin proteins,

27:41.927 --> 27:44.872
I found translucent fibers of glass.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.318
- Fiberglass?
- Exactly.

27:46.342 --> 27:48.526
He must have inhaled them in.

27:48.550 --> 27:52.197
I'd say, most likely from insulation.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.275
Maybe the house wasn't just a body drop.

27:54.299 --> 27:56.039
He's speaking softly,

27:56.063 --> 27:59.634
but Lance Corporal Finn has more to say.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.308
Would you mind clearing up, Mr. Palmer?

28:06.332 --> 28:06.988
Not at all, Doctor.

28:07.012 --> 28:09.750
I know you've been putting
in long hours recently.

28:09.774 --> 28:11.332
Just doing my job.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.008
I appreciate the can-do
attitude. Good night.

28:14.032 --> 28:15.322
Night, Doctor.

28:15.858 --> 28:18.073
Agent Lee, you're working late.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.959
Still organizing paperwork on
the Wheaton case, Dr. Mallard.

28:20.983 --> 28:22.835
I need the autopsy report.

28:22.859 --> 28:25.691
What happened to the one I
sent up to Legal yesterday?

28:25.715 --> 28:28.261
I'm afraid I shredded it by mistake.

28:28.285 --> 28:29.504
You must be more careful.

28:29.528 --> 28:31.273
I know. I'm sorry, Dr. Mallard.

28:31.297 --> 28:32.534
No worries.

28:32.558 --> 28:34.953
I'm sure Mr. Palmer will
give you what you need.

28:34.977 --> 28:36.513
Okay. Thank you.

29:04.516 --> 29:06.617
That's about how it
looked three months ago.

29:06.641 --> 29:08.742
The living room floor was
the last thing we closed up.

29:08.766 --> 29:11.063
We ran the AC ducts under this section.

29:11.087 --> 29:12.797
The damn inspector was weeks late.

29:12.821 --> 29:14.273
You have security at night here, Bob?

29:14.297 --> 29:15.947
Not on a job this size.

29:15.971 --> 29:19.617
We use standard fiberglass
insulation, CDX subfloor.

29:21.547 --> 29:23.008
You see something?

29:23.324 --> 29:25.237
Well, yeah, your joist,
24 inches on center.

29:25.261 --> 29:26.873
I would have built them on 16.

29:26.897 --> 29:28.697
Then you wouldn't make a profit.

29:30.212 --> 29:32.653
That joist there look discolored to you?

29:34.564 --> 29:35.670
Could be mold.

29:35.694 --> 29:37.803
Mold spreads from the bottom up.

29:39.636 --> 29:41.127
Need a black. On it, boss.

29:41.151 --> 29:42.551
We'll be there soon.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.164
Boss,

29:44.850 --> 29:47.411
Abby ran the prepaid phone
card we found in Finn's pocket.

29:47.435 --> 29:48.503
Had only one call in it.

29:48.527 --> 29:50.471
It was to a self-storage
company in Dale City, Virginia.

29:50.495 --> 29:52.715
- Good. Call the storage...
- I... I did.

29:52.739 --> 29:54.773
I was just taking a breath.

29:54.797 --> 29:56.920
I called the self-storage place.

29:56.944 --> 30:00.006
Finn paid for the unit in
cash, only signed in once,

30:00.030 --> 30:01.279
so I figured that...

30:01.303 --> 30:03.743
Ziva and I should probably
get down there and check it out.

30:04.627 --> 30:06.269
Sorry about the breath.

30:08.344 --> 30:10.016
Kind of reminds me of Pacific Heights.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.584
Don't tell me. A movie?

30:11.608 --> 30:12.668
Yeah, interesting plot.

30:12.692 --> 30:15.698
Yuppie couple buys
their dream house then

30:15.722 --> 30:18.071
the tenant from hell
tries to destroy it.

30:18.095 --> 30:20.054
Michael Keaton's best work.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.131
Looks like organic material.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.738
Would a two by six
match Finn's head injury?

30:28.762 --> 30:30.803
Ducky thinks the blunt
object hit his temple.

30:30.827 --> 30:32.740
Or maybe his temple hit a blunt object.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.408
Which would have landed him
nose-first in this insulation.

30:35.432 --> 30:37.465
Get a sample of this wood back to Abby.

30:37.903 --> 30:39.372
Oh, my God!

30:39.538 --> 30:42.074
Bob, why are you letting
them destroy our property?

30:42.098 --> 30:44.042
- They're cops, Jody.
- What is she doing here?

30:44.066 --> 30:45.821
I called her. She should
know what's going on.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.170
Well, it's coming out
of your profits, Bob.

30:47.194 --> 30:48.209
Wait a minute, Jody.

30:48.233 --> 30:49.588
That sisal's expensive.

30:49.612 --> 30:51.737
You need to calm down, Mrs.arvell.

30:51.761 --> 30:52.686
Calm down?

30:52.710 --> 30:55.964
I just found a dead guy in the living
room and I am losing money every day.

30:55.988 --> 30:59.943
Oh, and my father just died of leukemia,
so don't you tell me to calm down.

31:09.431 --> 31:12.475
I'm thinking before we open this up, maybe
we should rub some Vick's under our noses.

31:12.499 --> 31:14.456
I don't think we'll find a body.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.715
Hope not.

31:16.221 --> 31:17.497
Hate that.

31:23.086 --> 31:24.367
Nothing?

31:24.789 --> 31:27.095
Well, whatever Lance Corporal Finn
was planning on putting in here,

31:27.119 --> 31:28.926
he didn't get a chance to.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.873
McGee, give me your flashlight.

31:35.432 --> 31:36.749
You didn't bring your own?

31:36.773 --> 31:39.236
It's too heavy. It pulls my pants down.

31:41.957 --> 31:43.547
Now close the door.

31:57.409 --> 31:59.896
- To the right. To the right.
- Yeah.

32:00.032 --> 32:02.830
Just, more to the
left. More to the left.

32:02.854 --> 32:03.222
Okay.

32:03.246 --> 32:05.220
- Okay, hold it.
- Yeah.

32:11.634 --> 32:13.585
Too small to hold a body.

32:13.804 --> 32:15.514
Big enough to hold a head.

32:23.597 --> 32:25.045
Is that what I think it is?

32:25.069 --> 32:26.409
Oh, yes.

32:26.983 --> 32:28.143
Gold.

32:31.232 --> 32:34.131
Hey, got another DNA sample
to test. It's a rush job.

32:34.155 --> 32:37.160
So, should I put it in
front of my other rush jobs?

32:37.184 --> 32:38.208
Yes.

32:38.232 --> 32:40.475
Okay, I'll make it a
rush-rush job, right on it,

32:40.499 --> 32:41.944
unless I get a
rush-rush-rush job.

32:41.968 --> 32:42.660
Thanks Abs.

32:42.684 --> 32:44.258
Hey, um, could you tell Gibbs

32:44.282 --> 32:46.669
that I got the results
back from Rebecca's DNA?

32:46.693 --> 32:50.158
It does not match the genetic
material in Finn's shorts.

32:50.182 --> 32:50.980
That means we're...

32:51.004 --> 32:52.766
Looking for a third one.

33:01.899 --> 33:03.949
Since you revisited the crime scene,

33:03.973 --> 33:06.512
I decided I want to revisit the body.

33:06.536 --> 33:08.733
Something's troubling me.

33:08.757 --> 33:09.411
Me, too.

33:09.435 --> 33:10.835
Uh-huh. What's that, Tony?

33:10.859 --> 33:14.189
Well, Finn had two entrees
and still had room for dessert.

33:14.213 --> 33:16.600
Makes me wonder if there
was anything, you know,

33:16.624 --> 33:18.899
- special about him.
- Like what?

33:19.598 --> 33:22.733
Oh... like that.

33:22.877 --> 33:28.806
Did he have extra women because he
had something extra for the women?

33:28.830 --> 33:29.409
Well,

33:29.433 --> 33:31.655
take a look for yourself.

33:34.259 --> 33:35.229
Sadly,

33:35.253 --> 33:38.885
the first thing the maggots
eat is the soft tissue.

33:39.089 --> 33:40.678
Still, you've given me an idea.

33:40.702 --> 33:41.853
To vomit?

33:41.877 --> 33:45.358
No, to reexamine the soft tissue.

33:45.638 --> 33:47.159
Thanks, Tony.

33:47.243 --> 33:48.749
I do what I can.

33:50.709 --> 33:52.777
Ducky, is there any way to...

33:52.801 --> 33:55.779
psychologically un-see something?

33:56.101 --> 33:58.965
Finn's bag contained 120 ounces of gold

33:58.989 --> 34:02.853
worth about $78,400 at
today's conversion rate.

34:02.877 --> 34:03.938
Mint numbers?

34:03.962 --> 34:05.128
Tracing 'em now

34:05.152 --> 34:07.405
the coins were purchased over
the Internet in three batches.

34:07.429 --> 34:08.701
I should have the
dates here in a moment.

34:08.725 --> 34:10.826
We figured $60,000
came from the fiancees,

34:10.850 --> 34:13.101
and Finn must have tossed in the rest.

34:13.717 --> 34:14.876
Officer David.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.386
Okay, first batch of gold
purchased nine months ago

34:17.409 --> 34:18.969
and paid for with a money order.

34:18.993 --> 34:20.559
- The second batch...
- That was Abby.

34:20.583 --> 34:23.543
She was searching non-standard
databases with the third woman's DNA.

34:23.567 --> 34:26.089
She got a hit on a
bone marrow donor bank.

34:26.112 --> 34:27.197
Pull it up.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.222
That's not what I expected.

34:32.246 --> 34:33.971
Her father died of leukemia.

34:33.995 --> 34:34.844
Pick her up.

34:34.869 --> 34:36.623
Take DiNozzo with you.

34:43.978 --> 34:44.916
You interrogated her

34:44.940 --> 34:46.898
and didn't pick up
she had sex with Finn?

34:46.922 --> 34:49.132
It was an interview,
not an interrogation-

34:49.157 --> 34:51.619
and excuse me if my brain
didn't go to the sex place.

34:51.643 --> 34:52.177
Mine would.

34:52.201 --> 34:54.505
I'm sure that's why you have a
leg up on other investigators.

34:54.530 --> 34:57.678
See? You say "leg up," I
instantly went to the sex place.

34:58.742 --> 34:59.577
Hey!

34:59.601 --> 35:01.801
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, stop!

35:02.608 --> 35:03.715
Stop!

35:06.501 --> 35:08.677
I'm sorry, I need to
go. I have a showing...

35:08.701 --> 35:10.434
At NCIS.

35:11.791 --> 35:13.079
What's going on?

35:14.201 --> 35:15.007
Hey.

35:15.031 --> 35:16.031
Hey!

35:16.169 --> 35:17.677
Stop pointing a gun at my wife.

35:17.701 --> 35:18.904
She tried to rat on us.

35:18.928 --> 35:19.770
She means rabbit.

35:19.794 --> 35:21.135
Rabbit. Yes.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.207
I was in a hurry for a showing.

35:23.231 --> 35:24.578
Are you arresting her?

35:24.602 --> 35:27.041
Taking her to NCIS to
answer a few questions.

35:27.065 --> 35:27.968
Well, I'm coming too.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.667
- Rick, you don't have to...
- Jody, I'm your husband.

35:31.557 --> 35:34.163
So why didn't you tell us
you knew Lance Corporal Finn?

35:34.187 --> 35:36.273
I was afraid that my
husband would find out.

35:36.297 --> 35:37.702
That you killed him?

35:37.816 --> 35:39.556
I didn't kill James.

35:39.580 --> 35:40.400
It was an accident.

35:40.424 --> 35:42.690
He fell, he hit his
head; I did not kill him.

35:42.714 --> 35:43.942
I loved him.

35:44.486 --> 35:45.887
Swear to God.

35:45.933 --> 35:48.577
Do you have any idea how many murderers
swear to God they didn't do it?

35:48.601 --> 35:50.406
I come from a good Catholic family.

35:50.430 --> 35:52.577
When we swear to God, we mean it.

35:53.444 --> 35:54.837
Room for one more?

35:54.861 --> 35:57.135
I haven't seen you in
Observation for a while, Ducky.

35:57.159 --> 35:59.864
I've learned as much
as I can from the dead.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.659
It's time to listen to the living.

36:02.683 --> 36:03.724
You met in a bar.

36:03.748 --> 36:04.648
Yes.

36:04.672 --> 36:05.744
How did you know that?

36:05.768 --> 36:06.389
When?

36:06.413 --> 36:07.587
Nine months ago.

36:07.611 --> 36:08.876
You sleep with him that night?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.120
No!

36:11.145 --> 36:14.098
That's right - I forgot you're
from a good Catholic family.

36:14.122 --> 36:16.126
Did you sleep with him the second night?

36:18.478 --> 36:19.901
Your husband never knew.

36:19.925 --> 36:24.042
I would tell him that I had a late showing,
and I'd meet James at the house on Larson Lane.

36:24.066 --> 36:26.807
I know that that sounds immoral,
but it is not what you think.

36:26.831 --> 36:29.640
Well, let me guess. You had
a deep spiritual connection.

36:29.664 --> 36:31.096
Exactly.

36:32.317 --> 36:34.712
I had already decided I
was gonna leave my husband.

36:34.736 --> 36:35.777
I just had to wait for...

36:35.801 --> 36:36.830
Your father to die.

36:36.854 --> 36:38.420
When you say it, it sounds horrible.

36:38.444 --> 36:39.324
Oh yeah. It is.

36:39.348 --> 36:42.293
If Dad knew I was getting a
divorce, he'd have disowned me.

36:42.317 --> 36:45.692
She inherited $2 million
last month when Dad died.

36:45.716 --> 36:47.282
Ah...

36:48.888 --> 36:50.756
How about if you were a murderer?

36:50.780 --> 36:52.579
I didn't kill James.

36:52.603 --> 36:53.717
You buried him.

36:53.741 --> 36:54.493
No.

36:54.517 --> 36:56.717
I did not even know that he was dead.

36:56.741 --> 36:59.362
I will admit that we had a fight.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.909
James wanted to borrow money...

37:02.317 --> 37:04.803
and I refused, and he got angry, and...

37:05.392 --> 37:07.538
and he said that we were through.

37:07.697 --> 37:09.362
He got up to leave.

37:09.386 --> 37:11.788
I just wanted him to stay.

37:12.151 --> 37:14.004
I, uh...

37:14.801 --> 37:16.317
took his cigarettes.

37:16.341 --> 37:17.677
Give 'em back! No!

37:17.701 --> 37:19.801
Now! No! Not unless you promise...

37:20.501 --> 37:23.501
James!

37:25.245 --> 37:28.100
I just got in my car,
and I drove for hours.

37:28.124 --> 37:31.429
I came back to-to check on him,
to see if he was okay, but...

37:31.453 --> 37:33.212
He was dead, so you buried him.

37:33.236 --> 37:35.936
No. James was gone.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.127
I thought that he was fine,

37:37.151 --> 37:40.102
until I went to that house
for the showing the other day.

37:40.126 --> 37:41.874
And there he was.

37:43.171 --> 37:45.845
And I could only think
of one explanation.

37:47.142 --> 37:49.552
It was the hand of God.

37:49.576 --> 37:52.431
- Can Gibbs arrest God?
- I don't know.

37:52.455 --> 37:55.136
It's like the Thing trying
to bring in the Hulk.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.900
She's telling the truth.

37:59.692 --> 38:00.934
Where you going?

38:01.301 --> 38:02.743
To tell Gibbs.

38:04.477 --> 38:05.839
What do you think?

38:05.863 --> 38:08.101
I'm glad the glass is bullet-proof.

38:12.129 --> 38:15.211
Excuse me, uh, could
I have a word? With you?

38:16.432 --> 38:17.599
Working.

38:18.067 --> 38:20.892
It's related and important.

38:26.181 --> 38:28.223
She's telling the truth.

38:28.593 --> 38:29.978
God put the body there?

38:30.002 --> 38:31.817
No. Someone who was playing God.

38:31.841 --> 38:33.535
She didn't bury him.

38:33.559 --> 38:34.906
Your gut telling you this?

38:34.930 --> 38:37.092
I've been watching
her. She feels guilt...

38:37.116 --> 38:38.154
empathy, remorse.

38:38.178 --> 38:40.159
That doesn't fit the
psychological profile.

38:40.183 --> 38:43.466
She's deceitful, conniving,
an adulterous, which does.

38:43.490 --> 38:45.855
I'm trying to give you
my professional opinion.

38:45.879 --> 38:49.466
Then tell me after I have
finished interrogating the suspect.

38:53.258 --> 38:54.334
Timothy?

38:54.358 --> 38:55.397
Do you have a moment?

38:55.421 --> 38:57.605
Uh, actually, I'm watching
Jody Carvell's husband.

38:57.629 --> 38:59.979
Yes, I know... I want
to have a word with him.

39:00.003 --> 39:00.310
Sure.

39:00.334 --> 39:04.101
And for you to tape it with
that new cell phone of yours.

39:04.136 --> 39:04.959
Tape you?

39:04.983 --> 39:07.160
No, no, no, no. Not me. Him.

39:07.184 --> 39:09.329
Surreptitiously, of course.

39:09.369 --> 39:10.589
Of course.

39:13.053 --> 39:14.332
Here you go, Mr. Carvell.

39:14.356 --> 39:15.094
Thank you.

39:15.118 --> 39:17.874
Uh, this is our medical examiner,

39:17.898 --> 39:19.947
Uh, call me Ducky. Everyone does.

39:19.971 --> 39:21.250
Uh, Rick.

39:21.274 --> 39:22.297
Strange, isn't it, Rick,

39:22.321 --> 39:25.101
someone committed a murder... standard.

39:25.261 --> 39:26.712
But then they covered it up...

39:26.736 --> 39:28.636
standard.

39:28.780 --> 39:31.861
And then... they uncovered it.

39:32.136 --> 39:34.001
Far from standard.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.050
You think my wife was involved.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.166
No.

39:37.627 --> 39:39.555
And that's the problem.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.415
James was a big man-

39:41.439 --> 39:44.194
there is no way that I could've
picked him up and buried him.

39:44.218 --> 39:45.477
Oh, that's easy.

39:45.501 --> 39:47.804
You roll him onto the
plastic and you drag him out.

39:47.828 --> 39:49.439
Without ruining these nails?

39:49.463 --> 39:51.738
- Look at them.
- They are so perfect.

39:52.620 --> 39:55.934
I tried to convince Agent Gibbs

39:55.958 --> 39:59.251
that your wife was telling the truth.

40:00.208 --> 40:02.423
I'm afraid he doesn't believe me.

40:03.743 --> 40:06.201
Tell me, Rick, why does that please you?

40:06.433 --> 40:07.321
What?

40:07.345 --> 40:10.930
Well, you just flashed
a slight, reflexive smile

40:10.954 --> 40:13.710
when I said that Gibbs
didn't believe your wife

40:13.734 --> 40:14.772
I did not!

40:14.796 --> 40:15.994
Timothy?

40:25.406 --> 40:26.535
I'm afraid

40:26.559 --> 40:28.435
he doesn't believe me.

40:31.101 --> 40:34.531
I don't know if God was watching
your wife and Finn that night,

40:34.555 --> 40:35.933
but you were.

40:35.957 --> 40:37.674
My-My wife and the dead guy?

40:37.698 --> 40:41.306
Yes, when your wife ran out of
the house, you buried the body.

40:41.330 --> 40:42.761
My God, man, why would I do that?

40:42.785 --> 40:44.773
Because you wanted the money.

40:45.377 --> 40:47.312
Well, you had to wait
until her father died

40:47.336 --> 40:50.103
before you could implicate
her in the murder.

40:50.631 --> 40:52.891
But once she got her inheritance,

40:52.915 --> 40:55.717
you disinterred the body.

40:55.741 --> 40:58.204
You-you have a vivid
imagination, Ducky.

40:58.228 --> 41:00.781
But, uh, imagination
doesn't prove anything.

41:00.805 --> 41:02.677
No, you're quite right there.

41:02.701 --> 41:04.609
But evidence does.

41:04.633 --> 41:06.003
Ah, good.

41:06.027 --> 41:07.157
Abby

41:07.391 --> 41:10.593
have you lifted the DNA
from the shovel handle yet?

41:10.617 --> 41:14.225
You know, from the sweat
we discovered on the handle.

41:14.249 --> 41:15.995
Oh. Yeah, uh, right.

41:16.019 --> 41:18.919
I - I've got it running. I'm ready
to check it. I just need a sample.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.254
Well, then...

41:21.601 --> 41:25.159
test it against the saliva on this.

41:27.420 --> 41:29.101
You're right.

41:29.304 --> 41:30.342
I tried to cover up

41:30.366 --> 41:31.895
her murder.

41:32.146 --> 41:33.698
But I didn't kill him.

41:34.686 --> 41:36.342
That cheating bitch did.

41:36.366 --> 41:39.681
Boss, Mr. Carvell here admitted
to Ducky he buried the body.

41:39.705 --> 41:40.970
Oh, my God.

41:41.219 --> 41:42.144
It was you?

41:42.168 --> 41:43.802
Who else cleans up your messes?

41:43.826 --> 41:45.536
I was watching the two
of you from the window.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.095
You watched us make love?

41:47.119 --> 41:48.678
That's not what I'd call it.

41:48.935 --> 41:49.868
Then what happened?

41:49.892 --> 41:50.840
They had a fight,

41:50.864 --> 41:53.763
- she hit him on the head, and she ran.
- Rick!

41:54.562 --> 41:56.031
All I did was bury him.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.743
Well, I'm afraid you
did a bit more than that.

41:58.856 --> 41:59.782
Right

41:59.820 --> 42:01.040
I unburied him.

42:01.064 --> 42:02.367
Sit down.

42:02.510 --> 42:05.961
A reexamination of the
conjunctival and facial tissues

42:05.985 --> 42:09.886
revealed petechial hemorrhages
suggesting asphyxia.

42:09.910 --> 42:13.977
So I looked for
atelectasis in his lungs,

42:14.001 --> 42:15.365
which results...

42:15.682 --> 42:19.728
from shallow breathing due
to an obstruction such as plastic.

42:19.752 --> 42:21.869
And there it was.

42:23.489 --> 42:26.312
Lance Corporal Finn was buried alive.

42:26.336 --> 42:28.040
He was dead!

42:28.064 --> 42:29.456
I know he was dead.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.027
You bastard, you killed him!

42:33.580 --> 42:34.151
Ziva,

42:34.175 --> 42:35.365
get her out of here.

42:36.127 --> 42:37.287
McGee.

42:37.566 --> 42:39.238
Handcuff him and get a sworn statement.

42:39.262 --> 42:40.526
I hope you fry!

42:40.550 --> 42:41.974
Go to hell!

42:43.052 --> 42:44.234
Go to hell.

42:45.622 --> 42:46.752
Wow.

42:47.301 --> 42:49.215
I got to come up here more often.

42:50.882 --> 42:52.350
Gibbs, I screwed up.

42:52.374 --> 42:54.498
Well, yeah. You almost
spilled my coffee.

42:54.522 --> 42:58.017
When Tony and I ran out to pick up Jody,
I left Finn's bag of gold on my desk.

42:58.041 --> 42:59.125
Mm-hmm.

42:59.149 --> 43:01.430
I know I should've taken it to
evidence, but we were focusing on...

43:01.454 --> 43:03.001
Here's the inventory.

43:05.401 --> 43:07.278
You took it to evidence.

43:08.734 --> 43:11.814
It says here the bag contained
$18,000 worth of gold.

43:11.838 --> 43:13.910
We are $60,000 short.

43:15.764 --> 43:18.808
You gave Siri and Rebecca back
the money they loaned Finn.

43:19.148 --> 43:21.513
I thought I'd save the
courts some paperwork.

43:21.537 --> 43:22.960
You wouldn't be getting soft?

43:22.984 --> 43:25.153
Of course not. You
shaved your moustache.

43:25.177 --> 43:27.813
Uh, boss, reception called this
morning, they said that someone was here

43:27.837 --> 43:29.651
with information about-sorry-

43:29.675 --> 43:32.485
about a case. I went
to meet her, and, um,

43:32.509 --> 43:34.338
this is Jessica Coleman,

43:34.362 --> 43:36.464
James Finn's fiancee.
