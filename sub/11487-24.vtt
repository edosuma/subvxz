00:02.280 --> 00:04.111
Hello?

00:07.600 --> 00:09.272
Anybody?

00:11.320 --> 00:13.231
Big news.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.111
l'm gonna marry Mia.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.069
Hey, Alan.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.992
l'm in the shower.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.713
Guess what l'm gonna do
with Mia.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.870
Guess what l'm already doing
with Kandi.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.554
That's not fair, Alan.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.199
You have to give him a hint.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.119
He doesn't need a hint.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.436
Well, then how's he supposed
to guess?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.354
Oh, well.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.749
Look, a place to hang my washcloth.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.031
The rule of thumb
with an engagement ring. . .

00:52.200 --> 00:54.873
. . .is that the price should equal
three months' salary.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.357
l wonder what broad
came up with that.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.354
lt's a marketing scheme dreamed up
by the international diamond cartel.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.238
Probably a bunch of chicks.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.952
But at least diamonds are forever.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.233
Oh, yeah, forever.
My ex-wife still has hers.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.035
Meanwhile, l'm wearing mismatched
socks from the irregular bin.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.431
Well, Mia and l are gonna go
the distance.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.079
Fifteen, maybe 20 years.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.952
That's not the distance.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.872
The distance is death.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.916
lf l'm still married
after 20 years, kill me.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.119
-l can't believe you're doing this at all.
-Why not?

01:31.280 --> 01:34.272
Why shouldn't someone like me
settle down with a wife and kids?

01:34.440 --> 01:36.317
Boy, l don't know where to start.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.716
That's the old Charlie
you're thinking of.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.029
Oh, okay.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.033
And to whom am l speaking now?

01:43.240 --> 01:46.232
-May l help you gentlemen?
-We're looking for an engagement ring.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.719
How nice.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.593
Do you have anything in mind?

01:54.320 --> 01:55.639
Nothing ostentatious.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.156
Something in a brilliant cut,
perhaps with complementary baguettes.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.709
Size isn't as important
as color and clarity.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.031
Well, someone knows what he wants.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.352
What can l say?

02:08.560 --> 02:10.390
He's my life.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.717
So basically l asked her to marry me
and she said yes.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.029
-What do you think about that, Jake?
-Good.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.029
That's it? Good?

02:27.600 --> 02:28.589
lt's not good?

02:29.040 --> 02:30.029
No, it's good.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.919
That's what l said.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.629
All right, l'm full.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.314
Wears his little heart on his sleeve,
doesn't he?

02:39.480 --> 02:40.799
lt's my own fault.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.509
l should've known better
than to talk to him at feeding time.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.872
Charlie, l need to speak to you.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.352
l'll be right out, Rose.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.352
-Did you tell her?
-Of course not.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.714
-Would you?
-No.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.235
-l'll let you be my best man.
-You mean l'm not?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.280
Well, you're on the short list
but this could cinch it.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.514
Come on, that woman has been
obsessed with you for years.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.513
She's gonna find out sooner or later.
Let it come from you.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.235
Yeah, l guess.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.630
She has a boyfriend now.
She probably won't care.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.791
-Probably not.
-So why won't you tell her?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.117
Because if l want my eyebrows shaved,
l'll shave them myself.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.115
Hey, Rosey Rose.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.232
What's up, Rosey Rose?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.873
Gordon dumped me.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.116
Oh, damn it to hell.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.753
l know, it's awful.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.673
How could he do this?

03:35.840 --> 03:39.230
He couldn't be with me anymore
knowing that l'm still in love with you.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.278
Oh, no, no, no.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.589
Yes, yes, yes. . .

03:43.760 --> 03:45.591
. . .yes, yes.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.358
Listen, Rose.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.520
-There's something l have to tell you.
-ls it good news?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.999
l could use some good news.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.312
Well. . .

03:57.480 --> 04:00.199
-. . .you remember Mia?
-Yeah.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.957
Don't tell me you're dating her again.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.633
No, no. No, we are not dating.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.598
Good. Because l always thought
she was kind of a head case.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.798
Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.875
Look, the thing is, l'm gonna,
kind of, marry her.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.873
Rose?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.389
-Did you hear me?
-l heard you.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.788
You're gonna marry Mia.

04:29.920 --> 04:30.909
So are you okay?

04:31.240 --> 04:32.309
Sure.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.629
Why wouldn't l be okay?

04:34.400 --> 04:38.393
Well, l was afraid the news might come
as a bit of a shock to you.

04:38.600 --> 04:39.635
Afraid?

04:39.800 --> 04:41.870
There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.996
You're my friend.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.152
Where are you going?

04:49.320 --> 04:50.389
l have things to do.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.239
-What kind of things?
-Things.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.234
Goodbye, Charlie.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.234
Hello, Alan.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.038
Hello.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.555
Did she just use the front door?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.949
She's never used
the front door before.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.915
What happened out there?

05:18.080 --> 05:20.196
Well, l told her
l was gonna marry Mia. . .

05:20.360 --> 05:24.353
. . .and l think l could actually see
her medication stop working.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.950
-What do you think she's gonna do?
-The question isn't what, it's when.

05:32.720 --> 05:37.714
And how l'm gonna enjoy my honeymoon
with my testicles glued to my ass-crack.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.235
-That's a pretty wedding gown.
-Oh, yeah.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.630
l could crawl under there
during the reception. . .

05:46.800 --> 05:48.916
. . .and no one would have a clue.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.830
Well, you would.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.553
Stop.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.069
l don't think you'd say that.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.993
lsn't it beautiful?

05:58.160 --> 06:01.470
They say you're supposed to spend
three months' salary but l went four.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.677
-Because l'm worth it?
-No, actually l had a slow first quarter.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.557
My dad called today. He wants to
take your family out for dinner.

06:09.720 --> 06:13.315
Yeah, well, tell him he can have one
or the other but not both.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.080
Come on, they're gonna have to
meet sooner or later.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.198
Okay, but why don't we wait
for a real happy occasion?

06:19.360 --> 06:23.797
-What's happier than a wedding?
-My mother's funeral springs to mind.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.556
There'll be music, dancing,
my mom will be in a box.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.357
You're horrible.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.953
That's a gorgeous wedding cake.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.109
lt's okay.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.919
l'm not big on having
the little action figures on top.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.310
-They kind of creep me out.
-They're traditional.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.199
Hey, this is our wedding,
we can do whatever we want.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.670
We don't even have to have cake,
we could have pie.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.271
A wedding pie?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.671
Well, we'd probably need
more than one.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.070
You know, so everybody gets
some crust.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.472
Alan, what do you think
about a wedding with no cake?

06:56.640 --> 06:59.279
No cake? Where would you put
the little bride and groom?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.916
l can think of one place.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.473
-lf you do a wedding, do it right.
-Thank you, Alan.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.518
You're welcome. Which reminds me,
l found my wedding folder.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.116
-Guess what was in it?
-The claim check for your manhood?

07:14.760 --> 07:15.749
As l was saying. . .

07:15.920 --> 07:19.230
. . .it's all here. Everything you could
possibly need for your big day.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.152
From paper samples
for your announcements. . .

07:21.320 --> 07:24.357
. . .to selected verses of poetry
well-suited for wedding vows.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.592
And you wonder why people
think you're gay.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.753
Oh, shush.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.912
Now, you're talking cake
but we are light years away from cake.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.356
First we have to discuss the budget,
the venue, how many guests.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.590
ls it gonna be a sit-down dinner
or a buffet.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.309
Then you need to hire a photographer
and a videographer. Then a florist.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.953
Have you thought about flowers?

07:44.600 --> 07:45.999
Well, lilies are nice.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.232
Lilies are perfect if the bride and groom
are recently deceased.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.599
But l like lilies.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.912
Mia, we'll never get through this
if you don't focus.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.111
Now, wedding party.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.111
Bridesmaids. What are they wearing?

08:02.280 --> 08:04.794
l suggest an unflattering style
in a hideous color. . .

08:04.960 --> 08:07.838
. . .because after all, this is your day.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.675
Oh, and before l forget, although
it's not politically correct to throw rice. . .

08:11.840 --> 08:15.469
. . .if you throw birdseed, you run the risk
of ending like a Hitchcock movie.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.677
What kind of pie
did you have in mind?

08:21.040 --> 08:24.669
Well, look who's here.
The bride of Drunkenstein.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.869
Look.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.550
Wow, that's quite a rock.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.910
You know what we call babes
with rings like that in my neighborhood?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.910
Stumpy.

08:36.919 --> 08:40.116
What are you looking at me for?
Just stay out of her neighborhood.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.350
That was uncomfortable.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.876
No, sand in my urethra
is uncomfortable.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.873
That meal was a freaking disaster.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.919
l'm gonna stay with my family,
try and calm my mother down.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.476
The miserable bitch.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.151
-Your family hates me, don't they?
-Not just you.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.837
l'll call you later.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.595
Do you believe your
future mother-in-law?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.433
Shows up at a four-star restaurant
wearing a tracksuit. . .

09:15.600 --> 09:19.354
. . .with the word ''juicy'' stretched across
her half-acre ass.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.636
l can read, Mom.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.351
Can we go back?
l forgot my doggy bag.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.875
We can never go back, Jake.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.232
Come on, it's not the end
of the world.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.756
Easy for you to say. You're not marrying
into the Addams family.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.599
Oh, like you were a prize.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.036
Slipping a prenuptial agreement
into my fiancée's menu.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.471
l am just trying to protect you. . .

09:41.640 --> 09:43.915
. . .from being wiped out
by a vindictive ex-wife. . .

09:44.080 --> 09:48.596
. . .who will use your hard-earned money
to finance a frivolous life of partying. . .

09:48.760 --> 09:51.354
. . .and shopping
and unnecessary plastic surgery.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.396
-Mom--
-Every one of my surgeries. . .

09:54.560 --> 09:56.471
. . .was necessary.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.358
And if l had signed a pre-nup. . .

09:58.520 --> 10:00.636
. . .you would never have gone
to music camp. . .

10:00.800 --> 10:04.349
. . .and Alan would have an overbite
you could use to open a can of Pennzoil.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.113
l didn't know Mia's last name
was Addams.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.556
l didn't know her sister is a cop.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.039
Was a cop.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.715
Now she's a dry drunk
with a grudge and a .38.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.071
Well, l liked her.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.676
Well, that's because she had
the same haircut as you.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.952
l was a little shocked that her father
stuck you with the bill.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.519
You know why you noticed that?

10:28.680 --> 10:30.750
Because the two of you
trampled each other. . .

10:30.920 --> 10:34.196
. . .trying to get to the men's room
when you saw the waiter bringing it.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.474
l drank a lot of iced tea.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.397
Well, l had a very nice time.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.637
Sure, you got to inform my bride-to-be
and her entire family. . .

10:43.800 --> 10:46.598
. . .that you had sex with me
before you had sex with him.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.116
l was just telling Mia
l know how lucky she is.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.794
Nevertheless, honey,
it was not an appropriate toast.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.951
Juicy-pants almost choked to death
on her lamb shank.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.837
Well, in all fairness, the woman was
stuffing her face like a musket.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.116
All l can say is,
after tonight's fiasco. . .

11:05.280 --> 11:08.352
. . .l'm gonna have to rethink
the seating chart for the wedding.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.397
Yeah, well, it won't be
that complicated.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.711
-Why not?
-Because none of you are invited.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.595
Well, Mom, if you wear an animal print
tracksuit to a nice restaurant. . .

11:19.760 --> 11:21.796
. . .people are gonna make comments.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.189
l agree.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.591
Calling you a cougar with arm fat
was over the line.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.752
Hang on.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.510
Hello, Mia.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.509
l'll call you back.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:47.440 --> 11:50.079
You don't think Mia's gonna turn
into her mother, do you?

11:50.240 --> 11:51.992
l wouldn't worry about it.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.149
Yeah.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.790
What l would worry about
is you turning her into our mother.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.713
Thanks for ruining my wedding night,
Dr. Freud.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.348
Hey, don't set the bar too high
for the wedding night.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.080
-What are you talking about?
-lt's a long, stressful day.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.233
You'll be exhausted, full of banquet food
and cheap champagne.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.435
Take my advice.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.830
Tell her you love her,
give her a big kiss. . .

12:14.000 --> 12:17.356
. . .and try to fall asleep with your ass
pointed toward an open window.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.955
You, sir, have the heart of a poet.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.909
l am merely the voice
of smelly experience.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.277
Well then, let me ask you this.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.829
l know things didn't end well
with you and Judith. . .

12:40.000 --> 12:42.594
. . .but overall,
did you like being married?

12:42.760 --> 12:44.034
Oh, l loved being married.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.156
Never missed having sex
with other women?

12:46.320 --> 12:49.039
Sure. But l missed that
before l got married too.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.354
What l loved was the idea of having
someone that l could always turn to.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.158
Someone who cared about me.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.357
Someone who'd always stand by me
through thick and thin.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.509
lt does sound nice.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.357
Yeah, so does Disneyland.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.033
Yet every day people stagger off
those giant teacups covered in vomit.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.752
But you'd do it again?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.154
What can l say?

13:15.320 --> 13:16.799
Marriage is a great ride. . .

13:16.960 --> 13:17.949
. . .until you puke.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.318
-Good night.
-Good night.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.192
Charlie.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.873
Mia?

13:35.800 --> 13:37.870
Your friend Rose
was just at my apartment.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.879
So how'd that go?

13:43.040 --> 13:46.032
She was wearing a bridal gown.
Planning on wearing it to our wedding.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.430
She wanted me to know
so we wouldn't clash.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.076
Well, that's kind of thoughtful, isn't it?

13:51.240 --> 13:54.118
l'm not finished.
She wanted to give me a shower.

13:54.520 --> 13:55.794
An engagement shower?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.235
An actual soap and water shower.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.873
l don't want her at my wedding.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.156
Hey, l don't want her in my zip code.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.912
But she's a close friend.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.670
-Charlie.
-All right, all right, l'll tell you what. . .

14:10.560 --> 14:12.437
. . .l'll cross Rose off the guest list. . .

14:12.600 --> 14:16.115
. . .if you dump that pistol-packing
hermaphrodite you call a sister.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.949
She's my maid of honor. . .

14:18.120 --> 14:21.271
. . .the gun is registered,
and she's taking hormones.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.316
While we're pruning,
what about your mother?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.357
Done. She's out. Now your mother.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.114
You would've thrown your mother
overboard for free.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.874
l don't care. lf she goes. . .

14:31.040 --> 14:33.793
. . .somebody on your side's gotta go.
How about your father?

14:33.960 --> 14:38.078
He takes us all out to dinner and the only
plastic he's got on him is his shoes.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.750
Charlie, he has to give me away
at the wedding.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.990
Give you away? That cheapskate?

14:43.160 --> 14:46.470
l'll probably have to trade him a pony
and a couple of blankets for you.

14:47.160 --> 14:51.073
We're gonna have a wedding that none
of our family and friends can attend?

14:51.240 --> 14:53.834
Might as well go to Vegas and elope.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.790
Now, there's an interesting concept.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.474
ln Vegas, not only
could we get married immediately. . .

15:03.640 --> 15:06.359
. . .we can get drunk
and gamble away our nest egg.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.796
Don't forget the lap dances
and hookers.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.033
Oh, you're gonna make a great wife.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.357
All the wonderful plans
l had for a wedding.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.953
Let it go, Alan.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.112
l don't understand the big rush.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.236
You wouldn't even stop
for boutonnieres.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.671
l just wanna get this over with.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.909
Get this over with?

15:36.080 --> 15:39.470
That's the attitude you take
to a proctologist, not a marriage.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.592
Well, maybe l'm a little nervous.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.677
-ls that all it is?
-What are you saying?

15:43.840 --> 15:47.594
l'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy,
maybe you're not ready for this.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.069
-Did you have doubts when you married?
-None.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.310
Judith assured me
l was doing the right thing.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.197
That's all l got.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.429
Hi.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.433
-You look beautiful.
-Thanks.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.957
l was afraid you were gonna
chicken out.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.238
That's funny, she said the same thing
about you.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.309
Thank you, Kandi.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.757
Are you sure this is
what you wanna do?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.797
l'm sure. Are you?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.031
Absolutely.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.510
Okay. Who's the lucky couple?

16:34.680 --> 16:40.038
Well, we're the ones getting married,
so l guess it's them.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.549
-Charlie.
-A joke.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.109
Alrighty. Now, before we begin
the ceremony. . .

16:46.280 --> 16:49.113
. . .l need both your signatures
there and there.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.912
Okay.

16:51.080 --> 16:55.153
So are you folks staying in Vegas or are
you honeymooning somewhere else?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.390
l don't know.
What do you think, sweetie?

16:57.560 --> 16:59.835
Oh, can l talk to you for a second?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.758
What'd l say?
Am l in trouble already?

17:04.680 --> 17:07.911
Baby, l swear to God,
l think we're the lucky couple.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.867
Relax, l just want to talk to you
about our honeymoon.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.038
l'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.395
Frankly, l'd pick a place
with a nice ceiling. . .

17:16.560 --> 17:18.949
. . .because we're just gonna take turns
looking at it.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.194
Charlie, l would love to honeymoon
with you.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.031
But, well, l have to work. . .

17:25.200 --> 17:28.271
. . .and l think it'd be smarter
to use the money to redo the house.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.313
Oh, l get it.
You gave up trying to change me. . .

17:31.480 --> 17:33.436
. . .so now the house has to suffer?

17:33.760 --> 17:36.638
lf we're gonna have a family,
we'll turn the second bedroom. . .

17:36.800 --> 17:39.792
-. . .into a nursery.
-But that's where Jake stays.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.194
But once Alan moves out. . .

17:41.360 --> 17:43.715
. . .then Jake won't be staying there
anymore, right?

17:43.880 --> 17:46.838
-Alan's moving out?
-Of course he is.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.469
lsn't he?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.468
This is so romantic.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.154
When l was a little girl,
l used to love playing bride.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.753
Me too.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.558
l mean, l was the groom.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.671
Most of the time.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.037
You think you'll ever
get married again?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.430
l don't know. l hope so.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.030
You should because you'd make
a good husband.

18:10.200 --> 18:15.399
You're kind, considerate, dependable and
you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.633
Oh, come on, Charlie,
we need our privacy.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.075
But they're my family.
l can't just kick them out.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.111
You could've said something
before now.

18:25.280 --> 18:29.592
Who knew your idea of marriage
was you and me alone in a house?

18:30.120 --> 18:34.113
As long as l've known you, you've been
complaining about Alan living with you.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.350
And you want to take that
away from me?

18:36.520 --> 18:39.671
l thought you were ready to grow up
but clearly l was wrong.

18:39.840 --> 18:43.196
What's more grown up than wanting
to take care of my family?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.794
Let's not forget, you're the one
who came back to me.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.030
l only came back
because l wanted your sperm.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.077
Yeah, well, it's a package deal.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.596
My sperm and my brother
go hand in hand.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.275
Kandi, this is so sudden.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.079
l know. But lots of good things
are sudden.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.277
Like sun showers, orgasms.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.034
That's two things.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.073
Multiple orgasms.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.671
That's five.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.715
All right, deal's off.
Let's get out of here.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.235
Hang on. Are you really serious
about this?

19:19.400 --> 19:22.198
You love me, l love you,
the sex is great.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.271
The sex is unbelievable.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.317
Wait, what'd you say?

19:26.680 --> 19:28.671
l said the wedding's off.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.159
Oh, my God, what happened?

19:31.320 --> 19:32.309
lt doesn't matter.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.119
What's important is l just avoided
making a huge mistake.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.508
Charlie, l am so sorry.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.755
Oh, thanks.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.390
Now let's head for a strip joint,
get drunk and let the healing begin.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.835
Yeah, but before we do that,
l was wondering. . .

19:44.000 --> 19:46.434
-. . .could l ask you for a little favor.
-Yeah?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.875
-Can l borrow your wedding ring?
-What for?

19:49.560 --> 19:53.712
Well, l thought as long
as we're in Vegas, l'd marry Kandi.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.950
Are you insane?

19:59.120 --> 20:00.872
Oh, come on, you're not using it.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.632
By the powers vested in me
by the state of Nevada. . .

20:08.800 --> 20:11.837
. . .l now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.639
l don't freaking believe it.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.552
Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting
what you always wanted.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.154
l'm moving out of your house.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.958
l don't freaking believe it.
