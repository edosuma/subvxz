- Why don't you two take this
outside, huh?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.404

- All you wanna see is stuff

- I'd rather see

04:51.207 --> 04:52.667
- No, girls pick way better

08:56.035 --> 08:57.161
- Sure.
- Good. Pucker up.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.538
Pfft!
- Oh!

09:00.873 --> 09:02.708
Hey, this is not over!

09:05.211 --> 09:08.965
- And that concludes today's
segment of <i> He Says, She Says.</i>

09:09.048 --> 09:11.592
- We'll be right back with more
of <i> the Chase and Michael show.</i>

09:14.595 --> 09:16.389
- Man, Zoey and Logan
were fired up.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.641
- Yeah, man.
They were off the hizzy.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.144
I'm sorry.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.232
Hey, check out how many
people are watching us online.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.317
- 264 people?!

09:28.401 --> 09:29.568
- Uh-huh.
- We rock, dude.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.780
- Yep. And I think these
Zoey-Logan debates

09:32.863 --> 09:35.074
are gonna make the kids
here at PCA really think,

09:35.157 --> 09:36.367
you know?
- Yeah.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.828
It might really get people
talking.

09:38.911 --> 09:39.620
[all shouting at once]

09:39.704 --> 09:41.330
- Ok, ok, ok! Guys! Kids!

09:41.414 --> 09:42.248
Come on! Please, please stop!

09:42.331 --> 09:45.918
[overlapping shouting]

09:46.002 --> 09:48.379
I am in charge here!

09:49.297 --> 09:50.673
Please take your seats.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.674
- Bender!

10:00.766 --> 10:02.893
- Dean Rivers.
- Having a little trouble

10:02.977 --> 10:05.271
controlling your class?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.897
- Thing is, uh,
they got all whipped up

10:06.981 --> 10:10.067
about this debate they saw
last night on a webcast.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.610
- Whose webcast?

10:12.778 --> 10:15.489
- Chase Matthews
and Michael Barret.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.366
- How can a webcast--

10:17.450 --> 10:20.244
- Dean Rivers. Dean Rivers,
some seventh grade boys

10:20.328 --> 10:21.871
and girls are fighting down
by the gym.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.122
- Fighting about what?

10:23.205 --> 10:24.749
- Some webcast they saw
last night.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.627
- You get Chase Matthews
and Michael Barret

10:28.711 --> 10:30.463
down in my office
right now.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.923
- Yes, sir.
- And you,

10:33.007 --> 10:34.884
get your class under control.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.219
- Consider that done.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.639
[students shouting]

10:42.683 --> 10:45.394
- Your little webcast has
disrupted the entire campus

10:45.478 --> 10:48.105
of Pacific Coast Academy.

10:48.189 --> 10:48.647
- Sir, we were just--

10:48.731 --> 10:50.566
- Be quiet!

10:50.649 --> 10:52.693
- You should be quiet.
- I'll be quiet.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.445
- We don't need this kind of
trouble here at PCA.

10:54.528 --> 10:57.239
So I'm putting a stop to it.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.076
- And by "a stop" you mean?

11:00.159 --> 11:03.120
- Your webcast is canceled.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.747
- What?
- That's censorship.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.582
- Yeah, we have a right
to free speech.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.834
- You can't just cancel
our webcast.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.388
He just canceled our webcast.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.348
- Yep.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.655
- Chase?
- Hey.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.074
- What are you doing?

11:40.157 --> 11:42.243
- Lying here.
On a hammock.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.830
- Will you turn over
and talk to me?

11:45.913 --> 11:46.914
- No.
- Why not?

11:48.457 --> 11:49.959
- I'm depressed.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.293
- Ok.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.175
Boo.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.010
- Hello.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.221
- Want a grape?
- Feed me?

12:04.849 --> 12:08.185
- I'm sorry Dean Rivers
canceled your show.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.103
- Yeah, me, too.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.313
- I feel like it's my fault.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.066
- Come on. Before you and Logan
came on our webcast,

12:14.150 --> 12:15.985
only, like,
9 people watched it.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.863
We almost hit 300 last night
because of you guys.

12:18.946 --> 12:22.032
I can't believe Dean Rivers
just canceled us.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.909
- I know. It's censorship.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.995
- Huh. That's what we told him.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.163
Grape.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.084
Oh, hey.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.589
- A DVD?

12:36.672 --> 12:39.008
- Yeah, I burned our last 2
shows on there for you.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.844
It's good stuff, especially
you and Logan.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.053
You should watch it.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.973
- [sighs]

12:46.056 --> 12:47.516
- Um, to watch it, you know,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.352
you have to put it in a machine

12:50.436 --> 12:53.230
hooked up to a TV set.
- Thank you, Chase.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.798
- Nicole, do you hear me?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.929
If you hear me, respond.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.973
- I hear you.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.144
- Ok, she's ready.
Go for it.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.522
- Right.

13:34.605 --> 13:35.898
Nicole,

13:35.981 --> 13:38.526
listen to me carefully.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.320
- Listen to her carefully.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.241
- [clears throat]

13:45.324 --> 13:49.286
In your algebra class,
there are many cute guys.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.748
- So cute.

13:52.831 --> 13:56.085
- But now when you look
at them,

13:56.168 --> 13:58.504
you won't see them
for who they are.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.257
You will see them as...

14:05.344 --> 14:07.721
your grandfather.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.348
- Her grandfather?

14:11.475 --> 14:13.269
- My grandfather.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.105
Paw-paw.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.064
- Paw-paw?

14:18.274 --> 14:19.525
- Ew.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.025
- Ugh.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.372
- She's right over there.
- Ok. Thanks very much.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.126
Excuse me.
Zoey Brooks?

14:37.209 --> 14:38.752
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Jesse Freeman,

14:38.836 --> 14:40.588
producer over at K-Coast 7.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.755
- No way. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.299
- Wait. K-Coast the TV station?

14:43.382 --> 14:45.134
- Yeah. You watch some of
our shows?

14:45.217 --> 14:46.802
- No, they're lame.
- Dude.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.679
- Yeah. Dude.
- It's ok.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.472
I'm not offended...
that much.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.183
- So, you got the DVD?
- I did.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.476
- What DVD?
- The one you gave me.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.313
- You sent him the DVD?
- Yes, we already covered that.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.606
So, what'd you think?
- I thought the show

14:58.689 --> 15:00.983
was really terrific and that
it might be a good way

15:01.066 --> 15:02.651
for K-Coast to build up
our teen audience.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.236
- On TV?
- Mm-hmm.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.824
You'd be seen by an audience
of over 50,000 people.

15:08.907 --> 15:09.992
- Uh, deal.
- Deal?

15:10.075 --> 15:12.161
- Yes, simple word. 4 letters.
- Now be quiet.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.164
- Great. Just have a teacher
bring you down to the studio

15:15.247 --> 15:16.832
at 4:30 on Monday.
I'll take care of the rest.

15:16.915 --> 15:19.543
Sound good?
Zoey: Sounds awesome.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.004
- Well then, I'll see ya Monday.
- Yeah, you will.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.422
JESSE: All right.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.132
- Bye.

15:25.215 --> 15:28.010
Ok, you are amazing.
- Yes, I could kiss you.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.262
- Me, too.
- Ok, you know what?

15:30.346 --> 15:32.681
I'm sure
we'd all enjoy kissing Zoey,

15:32.765 --> 15:33.515
but we have a TV show to plan.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.352
- Yeah!
LOGAN: Right!

15:38.771 --> 15:40.856
- Drinks.
- Drinks.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.024
- I got my drink.

15:43.567 --> 15:48.072
- So to solve the problem,
you need to multiply both sides

15:48.155 --> 15:50.449
by the square root of
the original figure.

15:54.203 --> 15:59.041
- Nicole, come give Grandpa
a big ole hug.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.835
- Ohh!

16:01.919 --> 16:04.004
- And then we take
the "y" coordinate.

16:09.426 --> 16:13.347
- Nicole, come help Grandpa
do his laundry.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.182
- Ohh!

16:23.148 --> 16:27.152
- Nicole, go get Grandpa
his special ointment.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.987
- Ugh.

16:29.863 --> 16:30.155
- Nicole.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.534
Nicole?

16:33.617 --> 16:34.993
- Um, yes?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.620
- Are you distracted?

16:36.704 --> 16:37.913
- Nope. Not anymore.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.541
Let's just
focus on algebra.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.295
- So as I was saying...

16:58.517 --> 17:01.437
- A real TV studio, man.
Can you believe it?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.897
- Hey, guys.
Welcome to K-Coast.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.483
- Hey, man.
- Listen, I'm gonna need

17:06.567 --> 17:08.277
my hair and makeup done.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.529
- We have people for that.
- Good.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.071
- So, uh, where should
we set up our stuff?

17:12.156 --> 17:14.407
- What stuff?
- We brought some props

17:14.491 --> 17:18.871
for the comedy bits we do.
- Um...I guess I wasn't clear

17:18.954 --> 17:20.705
when we talked back at PCA.

17:20.789 --> 17:23.125
- Not clear about what?

17:23.208 --> 17:25.294
- Well, uh, we're only
interested

17:25.377 --> 17:28.172
in putting Zoey
and Logan on K-Coast.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.634
- But it's <i> the Chase</i>
<i>and Michael Show.</i>

17:32.718 --> 17:34.178
- And we're kinda
Chase and Michael.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.637
- Michael.
- Chase.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.347
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.266
- Listen, I'm really sorry.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.478
- Perfect.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.647
- Ok, you know what,
we're not interested.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.024
- Um, yes, we are.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.401
- Not without Chase
and Michael.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.528
- This face belongs on
television.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.821
- No, there's no way--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.364
Zoey, come here, come here.

17:55.824 --> 17:57.493
- We're not doing this without
you and Michael.

17:57.576 --> 18:01.121
- Look, that's really sweet,
but they don't want us.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.915
- But it's your guys' show.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.083
- No. Dean Rivers
canceled our show.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.794
But you guys have a really
cool shot here.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.338
And I want you to take it.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.723
- First positions.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.600
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.144
- Speed.
- 7, 6.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.648
- Has it started yet?
- It's about to.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.566
<i>MAN: And now live</i>
<i>in the afternoon,</i>

18:29.650 --> 18:30.818
He Says, She Says,
<i>with your hosts,</i>

18:30.901 --> 18:32.986
Zoey Brooks and Logan Reese.

18:33.070 --> 18:36.782
- Whoo!
Oh, my God! There they are!

18:36.865 --> 18:38.200
- Where's Chase and Michael?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.785
<i>LOGAN: Hello. My name</i>
<i>is Logan Reese.</i>

18:39.868 --> 18:41.662
<i>ZOEY: I'm Zoey Brooks.</i>

18:41.745 --> 18:45.374
<i>- And today we're gonna talk</i>
<i>about some interesting topics.</i>

18:45.457 --> 18:47.835
<i>First, girls and sports.</i>

18:47.918 --> 18:50.212
<i>Now, I think it's fine</i>
<i>if girls want to have</i>

18:50.295 --> 18:52.047
<i>their own little sports teams,</i>

18:52.130 --> 18:54.508
<i>but they should not be allowed</i>
<i>to play on the guys' teams.</i>

18:54.591 --> 18:56.343
<i>Zoey?</i>

18:57.845 --> 18:59.388
<i>- Yeah, you're right.</i>

18:59.471 --> 19:00.430
GIRL: What?
GIRL: What?

19:00.514 --> 19:03.642
- Huh?
- I said you're right.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.394
LOGAN: Ok.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.979
Let's move on to our
next topic, then.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.981
- Ok.
<i>LOGAN: Oh, yeah.</i>

19:09.064 --> 19:11.567
<i>Ordering at restaurants.</i>

19:11.650 --> 19:15.070
<i>I say girls take</i>
<i>way too long to order food.</i>

19:15.153 --> 19:17.239
<i>Ew, I'm a girl.</i>

19:17.322 --> 19:18.365
<i>I'll have a chopped salad.</i>

19:18.448 --> 19:20.617
<i>But I want</i>
<i>the lettuce on the side.</i>

19:20.701 --> 19:23.245
<i>[grumbling]</i>

19:23.328 --> 19:26.081
<i>Guys are just like,</i>
<i>give me a cheeseburger.</i>

19:26.164 --> 19:27.583
<i>End of story.</i>

19:27.666 --> 19:28.917
<i>Zoey.</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:30.836
<i>- I agree.</i>

19:30.919 --> 19:32.296
- What's she doing?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.925
- Why isn't Zoey fighting back?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.094
<i>- Ok. For our next topic,</i>

19:39.177 --> 19:40.220
<i>let's--let's talk about...</i>

19:42.681 --> 19:44.308
<i>eating kittens.</i>

19:44.391 --> 19:46.810
<i>I feel people should</i>
<i>eat more kittens.</i>

19:46.894 --> 19:49.563
<i>Little itty bitty baby kitty</i>
<i>cats for breakfast.</i>

19:49.646 --> 19:52.608
<i>You agree with that,</i>
<i>Zoey? Hmm?</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:54.943
<i>- You wanna know what</i>
<i>I'd like to talk about?</i>

19:55.027 --> 19:56.778
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Censorship.</i>

19:57.696 --> 20:00.616
<i>- Good. What's censorship?</i>

20:00.699 --> 20:02.451
<i>- Censorship is when someone</i>
<i>stops you</i>

20:02.534 --> 20:03.952
<i>from saying what you</i>
<i>wanna say.</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:06.663

20:06.747 --> 20:08.165
<i>- Uh, Zoey.</i>

20:08.248 --> 20:10.500
- Camera lady,

20:13.879 --> 20:16.256
<i>- Hello.</i>

20:16.340 --> 20:18.175
<i>- Howdy do?</i>

20:20.886 --> 20:24.139
- Chase and Michael go to
Pacific Coast Academy with me,

20:24.222 --> 20:24.932
<i>and they had this really cool</i>
<i>webcast.</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:26.642
<i>- Zoey--</i>
<i>- Shh.</i>

20:26.725 --> 20:30.187
<i>And the Dean banned it,</i>
<i>and I say that's censorship,</i>

20:30.270 --> 20:31.480
<i>which is wrong.</i>

20:31.563 --> 20:32.773
<i>And if you agree,</i>
<i>go to PCA</i>

20:32.856 --> 20:36.151
<i>and tell Dean Rivers</i>
<i>how you feel about censorship.</i>

20:36.234 --> 20:39.655
[all cheering]

20:39.738 --> 20:40.697
- Go Zoey!

20:40.781 --> 20:43.450
- Whoo!

20:43.533 --> 20:46.286
- And that's a commercial.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.289
- What was that?
- Yeah, are you insane?

20:49.373 --> 20:50.916
- Zoey, that was great.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.043
You just told like 50,000 people
what Dean Rivers did.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.836
- I know.
- Do you realize

20:54.920 --> 20:56.004
what's gonna happen?

20:56.088 --> 20:59.675
[overlapping shouting]

20:59.758 --> 21:02.844
- Will you people
get out of here?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.680
Who allowed you on this campus?

21:05.514 --> 21:08.225
Do I have to call the police?

21:10.394 --> 21:13.438
- Dean Rivers,
I have Zoey and Logan here.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.274
- Send them in.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.319
Zoey and Logan.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.447
- Hi, Dean Rivers.
- How you doing?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.783
- How am I doing?
Look what you've done!

21:24.866 --> 21:26.201
Those are tomatoes!

21:26.284 --> 21:29.413
That is a waste of lycopene.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.541
- Well, people get really upset
about censorship.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.377
- Just make them go away.
- I'm sure they'll leave

21:35.460 --> 21:37.212
if you let Chase and Michael
have their show back.

21:37.295 --> 21:40.257
- No. I will not be pushed
around.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.466
- Then you better tell them.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.844
- Oh, I'll tell them.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.557
All right, you people.
I am in charge of this school,

21:48.640 --> 21:53.437
and Chase and Michael cannot
have their show back!

21:53.520 --> 21:56.606
[overlapping shouting]

22:10.620 --> 22:14.583
Tell Chase and Michael they can
have their show back.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.423
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.050
- We got our show back! Oh!

22:23.133 --> 22:25.093
- Zoey!
- Hey.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.511
- You're back.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.804
- Zoey, you were so awesome
on the show today.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.931
- Thanks.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.101
- Nicole, Harry Matheau
walking this way.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.229
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, Nicole.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.814
Me and some guys are gonna
catch a movie on campus later.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.858
You wanna come?

22:39.941 --> 22:42.360
- Well, yeah. I'd...

22:44.571 --> 22:49.076
- Nicole, help me take out
my teeth.

22:49.159 --> 22:49.743
- Ew!

22:54.706 --> 22:57.000
