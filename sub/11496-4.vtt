00:03.870 --> 00:05.004
Hey.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.071
Hey.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.473
What you working on?

00:07.475 --> 00:09.241
Anything interesting?

00:09.243 --> 00:10.743
Yeah, actually.

00:10.745 --> 00:12.211
I'm-I'm building a new algorithm

00:12.213 --> 00:13.212
That weights search results...

00:13.214 --> 00:15.214
I'm gonna get laid.

00:15.216 --> 00:19.418
Congratulations.
Which hand are you going to use?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.420
That's, uh... That's funny.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.422
Because, um, you know,
if someone were to look

00:23.424 --> 00:24.890
At the two of us,

00:24.892 --> 00:26.825
They'd probably think
I'd be the one sitting home

00:26.827 --> 00:29.261
On a Friday night babbling on
about some geek nonsense,

00:29.263 --> 00:30.963
And you'd be the one
going out to,

00:30.965 --> 00:33.632
You know, get laid.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.635
Who's the "lucky lady"?

00:36.637 --> 00:37.803
Lyndsey is the lucky...

00:37.805 --> 00:39.238
Getting "laid-y."

00:39.240 --> 00:42.074
Doesn't it bother you
that after she's with you,

00:42.076 --> 00:43.976
She goes home
to her more handsome,

00:43.978 --> 00:45.277
Successful boyfriend?

00:45.279 --> 00:47.012
Why? I do the same thing.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.318
How did lyndsey end up with him?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.821
Well, how did <i>I</i> end up with him?

00:55.823 --> 00:57.856
Hey, walden.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.024
Hey.

00:59.026 --> 01:01.827
Michaela, heidi,
sarah, this is walden.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.929
He's super hot, super rich
and super single.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.066
These are my friends,
and we are all super high.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.934
Nice to meet you.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.335
Hi.
Nice house.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.238
(laughing):
I am so wasted.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.707
What are you guys doing tonight?

01:15.709 --> 01:17.342
Oh, we're gonna play poker.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.510
You want to join?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.145
Yeah, come play with us!

01:20.147 --> 01:23.348
It'll be fun.
I am so wasted.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.552
You know what, I-I actually
have a lot of work to do,

01:26.554 --> 01:28.287
And need to get
to bed early, but...

01:28.289 --> 01:29.955
You guys have fun.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.925
(gasps) we should
play strip poker.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.026
Yes.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.095
All right, ante up.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.165
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

01:40.167 --> 01:42.901
♪ ah.
♪ men.
♪ men.

01:47.807 --> 01:49.141
Hey.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.110
All right,
let's get it over with.

01:51.112 --> 01:54.847
Tell me all the disturbing
details of how you "got laid."

01:54.849 --> 01:56.715
She never showed.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.351
She couldn't get away from
larry, so I spent half the night

01:59.353 --> 02:02.087
Waiting for her
in the parking lot of an ampm.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.492
Wow, I'm actually enjoying
one of your stories.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.060
Please, continue.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.329
But on the plus side,

02:10.331 --> 02:12.831
At 12:01, all the donuts
became half price.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.567
By 12:19, I-I had made friends
with the guy

02:15.569 --> 02:18.303
Who lives
in the men's room, raul.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.638
Is he looking for a roommate?

02:21.107 --> 02:23.208
You laugh, but he actually
turned the changing table

02:23.210 --> 02:25.110
Into a murphy bed.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.646
I'm sorry,
but if I remember correctly,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.314
Last night, you were pretty sure

02:29.316 --> 02:31.483
That you were going
to "get laid."

02:32.919 --> 02:35.254
But, in fact,
you didn't "get laid."

02:35.256 --> 02:36.488
Are you done?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.824
Are you done not "getting laid"?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.125
(sighs)

02:40.127 --> 02:41.693
Seriously,
why are you doing this?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.095
Because I get
to have sex with lyndsey.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.863
But you didn't have sex.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.665
You ended up shame-eating
stale donuts

02:46.667 --> 02:49.768
And talking to a homeless guy
in a men's room.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.671
They were not stale,
and raul has a name.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.506
You can't let lyndsey
treat you like this.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.674
You deserve better.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.211
I know.
Raul said the same thing.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.413
Well, I had a great night
last night.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.015
I ended up playing strip poker

03:03.017 --> 03:04.850
With four incredibly
beautiful women.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.752
Oh, yeah,
I've been on that site.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.087
No, it was jenny
and her friends.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.190
What a sec, is that
the charge on my card

03:11.192 --> 03:13.625
For texassqueezeem.Com?

03:16.462 --> 03:18.697
Wait, you played strip poker
with my niece?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.732
She was the dealer.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.801
But she did flop a great pair.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.003
Walden, jenny is family.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.305
If you cross that line,

03:26.307 --> 03:28.040
I am not gonna be
your friend anymore.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.474
I mean, I'm still
gonna live here,

03:29.476 --> 03:31.109
But I'm not gonna be
your friend anymore.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.945
Relax, it was harmless fun.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.179
Jenny:
Hey!

03:34.181 --> 03:36.715
Look who's got his clothes on.
Uh...

03:36.717 --> 03:38.417
I had clothes on last night.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.918
Yeah, you were wearing a sock.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.620
And not on your foot.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.089
It looked like santa filled

03:44.091 --> 03:46.959
A stocking
at elton john's house.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.260
"harmless fun"?

03:48.262 --> 03:51.029
No, she did not see
bennie or the jets.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.633
Hey, we're gonna
hang out again tonight

03:54.635 --> 03:56.635
If you want to join us.
Yeah, sure.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.136
Cool. I'll see you at 11:00.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.137
What, 11:00?

03:59.139 --> 04:00.539
What is it, new year's eve?

04:00.541 --> 04:01.840
(laughs)

04:01.842 --> 04:03.475
Bring your sock.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.079
You're not really going out
with them, are you?

04:07.081 --> 04:09.047
Is this about jenny?
Will you stop it?

04:09.049 --> 04:12.351
I'm not the creepy guy who wants
to sleep with your niece.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.052
I'm the creepy guy
who wants to sleep

04:14.054 --> 04:15.721
With your niece's friends.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.456
And don't you think
that's a little sad?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.524
I mean, a 35-year-old man
hanging out with a bunch

04:19.526 --> 04:22.160
Of hot young girls who just want
to drink, party, get naked...

04:22.162 --> 04:23.795
And anything I say
after this point

04:23.797 --> 04:25.597
Doesn't really matter, does it?

04:25.599 --> 04:26.598
It doesn't.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.100
I've never had this in my life.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.869
Wh-when I was her age, I'd
already dropped out of m.I.T.,

04:30.871 --> 04:32.904
Gotten married
and started my own business.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.407
I was delivering pizza,
going to junior college

04:35.409 --> 04:36.908
And dating a melon.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.878
Oh, god!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.180
I called her my little honeydew.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.453
Walden?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.454
I'm up. Let's party.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.089
Jagerbombs,
bottle service.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.860
What's going on? I thought you
were going out with the girls.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.462
I am, but not until 11:00.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.499
What is it... 9:00?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.401
How can I be so sleepy?

05:02.403 --> 05:05.003
I've already had two naps
and three red bulls.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.539
Uh, my brother charlie had a
great trick for staying awake.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.675
Two hookers and an eight ball.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.510
I'll pass.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.744
What's with the bag?

05:12.746 --> 05:15.547
Oh, my god,
are you moving in with raul?

05:16.916 --> 05:19.284
No, lyndsey felt guilty
about last night

05:19.286 --> 05:20.786
And larry is on a business trip,

05:20.788 --> 05:22.954
So she is treating me
to a romantic rendezvous

05:22.956 --> 05:25.490
At a four-star hotel
at the beach.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.692
Oh, come on, man.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.460
She's treating you
like a piece of meat.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.629
I know, it's great.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.799
Plus, I have already masturbated
so I can hit the sweet spot

05:33.801 --> 05:37.035
Between "you're done already?"
and "enough already."

05:37.037 --> 05:39.237
Enough already.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.639
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.907
Okay, well, good luck.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.575
And give lyndsey my best.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.544
Sure, right after
I give her my best.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.479
Boo-ya!

05:51.017 --> 05:52.551
Hi.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.487
Oh, so you did decide
to show up tonight.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.889
I know. Sorry I'm late.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.990
It's fine.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.127
You just turned happy hour
into miffed hour.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.130
And four-dollar pot stickers
into eight-dollar pot stickers.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.833
Well, the important
thing is I'm here now,

06:07.835 --> 06:09.368
And you look really
nice tonight.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.103
Did you do something
different with your hair?

06:11.105 --> 06:12.371
You don't have to flatter me.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.673
You know I'm gonna give it up.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.742
But we do need to talk.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.844
I said I was sorry.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.479
It's not just that;
it's everything.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.813
It's the...
It's the sneaking around,

06:21.815 --> 06:24.750
It's the curt texts,
it's the going dutch.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.152
Alan, you know this
is complicated.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.453
I have a boyfriend.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.621
Yes, and I have feelings.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.490
And I am feeling disrespected.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.526
I hear you, and
I will work harder

06:34.528 --> 06:36.628
To make sure that you don't
feel taken for granted.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.096
Thank you.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.832
Now, why don't we
go up to our room

06:40.834 --> 06:43.168
And respectfully
disrespect each other?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.137
Ooh, someone wants a spanking.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.605
I know.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.140
Can it be me this time?

06:48.142 --> 06:50.342
Oh, yeah, we can play
naughty school girl

06:50.344 --> 06:52.210
And no-nonsense math teacher.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.278
Oh, no.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.815
Oh, yes, 138 divided
by two is 69.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.550
No.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.618
It's stephanie chapman.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.852
Shh. Maybe she
won't see us.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.754
Lyndsey, alan!

07:02.756 --> 07:04.856
Stephanie, hi.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.058
Oh, wow, uh, l-look at you,
you look great.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.729
I should. I got the lap-band,
and I dropped 172 pounds.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.863
Oh.
Good for you.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.398
Hold your applause till the end.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.499
This is the end.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.135
So, what are you two doing here?

07:17.137 --> 07:18.136
Oh, well...
There...

07:18.138 --> 07:19.371
Are you guys back together?

07:19.373 --> 07:20.906
No, no, we're just...
Did you split up with larry?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.574
No, alan and I are
just friends and...

07:22.576 --> 07:23.775
Wine, hotel?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.611
(singsongy):
I smell a hookup.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.448
Oh, we are... We are
definitely not together.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.917
Wh-what you smell are
eight-dollar pot stickers.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.586
So, wh-what brings you here?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.823
Uh, there is a singles' mixer,
and this former fatty

07:37.825 --> 07:40.258
Is looking for a sugar daddy.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.327
Make sure he's
a-a sugar-free daddy.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.628
(giggles)

07:43.630 --> 07:46.331
You are adorable.
I could just eat you up.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.067
I don't know, I'd probably
just taste like chicken.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.971
Mmm, I'll bring the biscuits
and you bring the gravy.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.477
Okay, I'm gonna leave
you two "friends" alone.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.346
Hashtag "suspicious."

08:01.348 --> 08:02.814
Great seeing you.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.815
You, too.
Oh, take care.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.950
I know you're gonna hate

08:04.952 --> 08:06.718
To see me go,
but you're gonna love

08:06.720 --> 08:09.154
Watching me walk away.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.156
Oh, god.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.024
She is the most annoying woman
on the planet.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.693
Yeah, she is horrible.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.027
You have to go
out with her.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.095
Hmm? What?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.096
She totally suspects

08:18.098 --> 08:19.364
We're having an affair.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.932
The only way to convince
her we're not a couple

08:20.934 --> 08:22.067
Is for you to ask her out.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.301
No.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.336
Forget her stomach.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.538
They should've stapled
her mouth shut.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.706
That's exactly the problem.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.907
She'll tell larry.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.243
Oh-oh, no, no, there-there has
to be an easier way.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.410
Can't I just kill her?

08:32.412 --> 08:35.080
It'd be a much smaller grave
to dig now.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.716
I'm serious, if you ever want
to have sex with me again,

08:37.718 --> 08:38.950
You will ask her out.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.585
Oh, fine, fine,
I'll-I'll ask her out.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.786
Now let's go upstairs.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.221
Oh, it's not gonna happen.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.222
She's right over there.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.223
I'm going home.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.558
But-but I thought
we were gonna...

08:46.560 --> 08:48.293
Good-bye.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.329
(huffs)

09:04.076 --> 09:06.978
(laughter, clamoring)

09:06.980 --> 09:10.315
Wow, this is a beautiful house!

09:10.317 --> 09:11.683
Who lives here?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.184
You do.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.387
Whoa, I must be rich!

09:15.389 --> 09:16.955
You are.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.156
Oh, yeah!

09:18.158 --> 09:20.392
Whoa, my fingers are glowing!

09:20.394 --> 09:24.062
I'm so rich I have
rainbow fingers!

09:24.064 --> 09:26.131
Hey, let's get some music going.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.465
Yeah!
Yeah!

09:27.467 --> 09:29.467
Oh!

09:29.469 --> 09:32.871
This is the greatest
song I've ever heard!

09:32.873 --> 09:35.173
Walden? Jenny?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.675
It-it's 3:00
in the morning.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.843
I know, and I'm still awake!

09:38.845 --> 09:41.313
And I'm still wasted!

09:41.315 --> 09:43.515
Oh, no, your fingers
aren't glowing!

09:43.517 --> 09:45.684
Oh, that's because he's poor.

09:46.986 --> 09:50.088
Oh, I am sorry, alan.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.257
Whoa!

09:52.259 --> 09:54.159
Your skin is so soft.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.628
Guys, feel alan's skin.
It's so soft.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.996
Whoa!
It's so soft.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.331
It's so soft.
Okay, okay, okay!

09:59.333 --> 10:00.832
Everybody stop touching me.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.233
Except you.

10:03.336 --> 10:04.603
Hi. I'm alan.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.872
Alan, I'm high.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.708
What-what is going on?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.409
Oh, alan, we were at a party,

10:11.411 --> 10:12.844
And we were drinking
and smoking,

10:12.846 --> 10:16.281
And then I ate a tiny pill
off of someone's nipple.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.216
It was like a nipple
pez dispenser.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.585
Okay, okay, it's time
for the party to end,

10:20.587 --> 10:22.053
And everybody
to just sleep this off.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.022
Yeah, alan's right.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.891
We should get naked and
go skinny-dipping in the ocean!

10:26.893 --> 10:28.360
Yeah, sarah's right.
Come on.

10:28.362 --> 10:31.796
(women whooping)

10:31.798 --> 10:34.499
Ha-ha! Yes!

10:37.903 --> 10:40.472
He's going skinny-dipping
with the hot chicks,

10:40.474 --> 10:43.408
And my girlfriend's
banging another dude.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.543
Can you throw me a bone, god?

10:45.545 --> 10:46.711
(thumping nearby)

10:46.713 --> 10:49.147
Oh, I didn't forget
about you, alan.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.650
There's a new melon
in the fridge.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.863
(chuckles)

11:04.865 --> 11:06.331
Oh, crap.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.300
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

11:12.772 --> 11:15.740
Don't be naked, don't be naked.

11:15.742 --> 11:19.044
Damn.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.513
Don't be naked,
don't be naked.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.981

Whoa!

11:37.497 --> 11:38.997
Morning.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.598
We're naked.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.599
Yes, we are.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.168
How did we get here?

11:43.170 --> 11:44.602
The last thing
I remember

11:44.604 --> 11:46.404
Was asking some chick,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.740
"can you mix these
with alcohol?"

11:48.742 --> 11:51.309
Apparently the answer is no.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.145
Okay, 'cause the...
'cause the last thing I remember

11:54.147 --> 11:56.247
Is you looking
in a mirror saying,

11:56.249 --> 11:58.483
"can we mix these with alcohol?"

11:58.485 --> 11:59.784
(laughs)
don't worry.

11:59.786 --> 12:00.819
Nothing could've happened.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.920
I'm gay.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.422
Ah, that's right.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.858
You're gay.
(laughs)

12:06.860 --> 12:07.859
Wait.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.993
How gay?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.196
Like, one being,
"yay, it's college!"

12:11.198 --> 12:14.399
Or ten being,
"I'm going subaru shopping

12:14.401 --> 12:16.468
With ellen and rosie."

12:18.337 --> 12:19.571
I'm closer to a nine.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.039
I mean, I make my own soap,

12:21.041 --> 12:22.607
But I don't sell it
at the lilith fair.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.876
Oh, great, great.

12:24.878 --> 12:25.977
I mean, granted you're prettier

12:25.979 --> 12:27.545
Than a lot of the women
I've dated,

12:27.547 --> 12:30.548
Ut you have an outie
and I'm into innies.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.283
Okay, okay,
so we didn't have sex.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.818
That is a load off.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.386
Uh, that's a poor choice
of words.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.124
Although sometimes
I date an innie

12:39.126 --> 12:41.226
Who has an outtie in her purse.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.895
What is that supposed to mean?

12:43.897 --> 12:47.632
I don't know,
I'm just saying it's possible.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.734
Oh, god, if alan finds out,
he's gonna freak out.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.536
He won't move out,
but he will freak out.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.138
Okay, settle down.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.607
We don't even know if there's
anything to freak out about.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.741
(stammers)
hello.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.510
Hello.
Stop that!

12:59.545 --> 13:00.812
We got to figure out what to do.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.180
Okay, what we're gonna do

13:02.182 --> 13:04.482
Is never talk about this again.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.917
So, you're just saying deny

13:05.919 --> 13:07.852
That we ever woke up
in bed naked together?

13:07.854 --> 13:10.188
I have a motto
for situations like this.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.190
What happens in jenny,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.259
Stays in jenny.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.498
So, I was really surprised
you called me.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.335
Well, I-I couldn't get
your voice out of my head.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.738
You're not the first one
to say that.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.874
There it goes again.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.911
No, I was surprised
because I was vibing there was

13:32.913 --> 13:34.979
Definitely something going on
between you and lyndsey.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.581
No, we're-we're just friends.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.116
And-and barely that.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.252
She's a drunk, you know?

13:41.254 --> 13:42.887
Oh, believe me, I know.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.422
You should hear wine bottles
in her trash bins

13:44.424 --> 13:45.657
On Friday morning.
Mm-hmm.

13:45.659 --> 13:48.259
I mean, clank, clank,
drunken skank!

13:48.261 --> 13:50.662
Yeah, she's a whore, too.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.631
I don't know
why she ever let you go.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.667
You are quite the catch.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.702
Uh, I know I present that way,

13:57.704 --> 13:59.737
But I'm more catch and release.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.873
Well, I am not releasing.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.141
(high-pitched whoosh)

14:03.143 --> 14:04.709
(clicks tongue)

14:07.379 --> 14:09.647
(laughs)

14:10.983 --> 14:12.784
You are so cute.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.886
Thank you.
Uh, you're not eating your food.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.287
Do you not like souplantation?

14:16.289 --> 14:19.090
No, I love it,
but since the surgery,

14:19.092 --> 14:22.060
I can't eat a portion
larger than my fist.

14:23.262 --> 14:24.462
But don't worry.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.531
That only applies to food.

14:32.171 --> 14:35.874
How are you still single?

14:41.180 --> 14:42.614
Hey.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.482
Hey.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.584
So, listen.

14:46.586 --> 14:50.054
Uh, about that thing
that didn't happen...

14:51.724 --> 14:55.226
I have a way to figure out
if it happened.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.196
I'm not peeing on any sticks.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.864
No.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.800
There is a camera in my room.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.302
(sighs)

15:04.304 --> 15:06.938
And that's why
I don't sleep with guys.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.439
It was your dad's.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.275
And that's why I drink.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.413
So we could watch the video back

15:15.415 --> 15:17.048
And know for sure.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.816
Or...

15:18.818 --> 15:20.351
We could erase it

15:20.353 --> 15:23.955
And continue to deny
that anything ever happened.

15:25.224 --> 15:26.591
Play it.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.092
Ah, damn it.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.894
I was sure you were
gonna say erase it.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.229
No, I want to watch it.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.498
It'll be like a quarterback
watching game film.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.067
Only the quarterback's
a lesbian.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.670
And the game's boning a dude.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.271
Exactly.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.539
Okay.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.376
Here we go.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.477
(sighs)

15:46.479 --> 15:48.346
Wait!
Erase it?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.647
No, I want to make popcorn.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.386
So both of my ex-husbands
turned out to be gay.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.489
But the weird thing is...
Is after I divorced them,

15:58.491 --> 16:00.591
They both turned straight again.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.393
What are the odds?

16:02.395 --> 16:04.562
Uh, well, this has been great.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.664
Whoa, somebody's fresh.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.032
(laughs)

16:10.102 --> 16:11.502
Come on in.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.705
I would love to take
you up on that,

16:13.707 --> 16:15.106
But, you know,
it's, uh....

16:15.108 --> 16:17.842
6:45...

16:17.844 --> 16:20.678
And, uh, I have
got to go home

16:20.680 --> 16:21.913
And, uh, hit the hay.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.448
Oh, I have hay here.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.551
And I will definitely
let you "hit it."

16:26.553 --> 16:28.086
That is tempting.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.588
Uh, and I am definitely
gonna have to come

16:30.590 --> 16:34.359
To terms with that while
I'm in the monastery.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.660
All right, I get it.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.228
You're making excuses

16:37.230 --> 16:38.930
Because you're still
in love with lyndsey.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.732
God, no, we're-we're
just friends.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.600
Yeah, and I didn't
just fart in your car.

16:44.103 --> 16:46.404
It's fine, okay?
I get it.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.073
I just feel bad
for her boyfriend.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.708
(groans) wait!

16:50.710 --> 16:52.744
Uh, if-if I was still
in love with lyndsey,

16:52.746 --> 16:54.145
Would I do this?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.782
Wow.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.551
Do that again, but keep
your eyes open and say my name.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.488
(muffled):
Stephanie?

17:03.490 --> 17:04.555
(both grunt)

17:09.128 --> 17:10.461
Are you sure about this?

17:10.463 --> 17:13.064
Because once we see it,
we can't un-see it.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.099
Yeah, worst-case
scenario, it's a video

17:15.101 --> 17:17.201
Of two hot people
having sex.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.971
Well, I'm just gonna say...

17:19.973 --> 17:22.140
If I had sex with one harper
in this house,

17:22.142 --> 17:23.708
Thank god it was you.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.746
(groans) okay.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.450
Oh, this is not
a good start.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.718
♪ bow chicka bow wow.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.586
Will you stop that?

17:35.588 --> 17:39.057

17:41.561 --> 17:43.494
You know what?
Let's just go back to denial.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.562
No, wait, wait!

17:44.564 --> 17:46.264
Wait, that is not me.

flintstone tattoo.

17:51.638 --> 17:55.706
You're the one
yabba-dabba-doin' her.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.110
I don't know who that is.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.850
You banged heidi.
Really?

18:05.852 --> 18:07.318
Yes! Good going.
