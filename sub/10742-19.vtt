                 You are sure
             you would not mind?

22:00.786 --> 22:04.454
Mind? I've been waiting 30 years
to do something for you.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.889
    Come along.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.992
Oh, it's you again.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.827
                  I have brought
                  an old friend.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.394
                 Now, may I have
                   my passport?

22:11.430 --> 22:12.963
Not so fast.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.531
How long have you
known this lady?

22:14.566 --> 22:16.700
 Thirty years.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.901
         Thirty years?

22:17.936 --> 22:19.370
                   May I have
                my passport now?

22:19.405 --> 22:21.872
   She saved my life
in Chicago 30 years ago.

22:21.907 --> 22:25.275
      She saved your life
    in Chicago 30 years ago?

22:25.310 --> 22:29.246
According to her application,
she wasn't even born then.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.881
        Well, she must have
          made a mistake.

22:30.916 --> 22:31.949
                          Heh.
She must have.

22:35.787 --> 22:36.920
          I asked her.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.890
  Uh, Johnny.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.625
It happens to be
a federal offense

22:41.661 --> 22:44.928
to try to obtain a passport
by fraudulent means.

22:44.963 --> 22:48.632
I'm going to have to hold
the both of you for federal--

22:53.572 --> 22:55.639
          Maybe back to Chicago.

             Good, good.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.311

             Well, I hope so.

     Uh, Roger, I think somebody
       wants to use the phone.

23:11.657 --> 23:12.623

23:12.658 --> 23:13.723
 You won, master.

23:13.759 --> 23:14.991
  I did not get
  the passport.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.693
So I will go with you
   in the bottle.

      Ouch!

              What's the matter?
     Ooh.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.499
 Oh, it is nothing.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.602
  I just saved a woman's life
from some gangsters in Chicago.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.703
                    Oh.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.907

   Put a nice, long sofa here
   in front of the fireplace.
