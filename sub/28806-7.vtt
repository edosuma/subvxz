[theme music playing]

01:36.638 --> 01:40.475
[Jessica] <i>How many superheroes
does it take to lock up a psycho killer?</i>

01:42.602 --> 01:44.354
<i>More than two, apparently.</i>

01:49.692 --> 01:51.486
They can't be here for Sallinger.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.448
Not unless someone at the station
tipped them off.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.554
[reporter 1] Mr. Sallinger! Over here!

01:59.619 --> 02:01.621
[reporters] Mr. Sallinger!

02:01.704 --> 02:03.039
[reporter 2] Weren't you caught

02:03.123 --> 02:05.083
with the victims' body parts
at the train yard?

02:05.166 --> 02:07.836
- Let me be stunningly clear. My client...
- Are you kidding me?

02:07.919 --> 02:10.598
- [reporter 3] Why hire defense?
- [reporter 1] Why was he arrested?

02:10.672 --> 02:13.675
The police were wildly misinformed.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.176
Our job just got harder.

02:15.260 --> 02:20.765
I told her that he slaughters people
and babysits their body parts.

02:21.516 --> 02:25.228
Hence, Mr. Sallinger is walking
out of this building a free man.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.021
She's cashing in.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.984
She needs the exposure
to put the shine back on her firm.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.547
What was he doing at the crime scene?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.904
Thank you for highlighting
yet another misconception...

02:35.613 --> 02:38.333
- She's a convincing liar.
- ...was not arrested at the train yard...

02:39.200 --> 02:41.744
Any move we make on him
is gonna be on the news.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.912
That's her goal.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.498
When he was unjustly arrested...

02:45.582 --> 02:47.876
The police were just doing their jobs.

02:47.959 --> 02:53.173
The misinformation... came
from the female vigilante Jessica Jones.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.258
[reporter 3] How did she
come by this information?

02:55.341 --> 02:59.053
[Sallinger] She broke into my home,
she assaulted me,

02:59.137 --> 03:03.725
and now she's trying to pin these horrors
on me, and I don't know why.

03:03.808 --> 03:07.645
Perhaps I'm an easy target.
A single, white male. And she's this...

03:07.729 --> 03:10.273
- You should go.
- ...feminist vindicator.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.108
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding...

03:12.192 --> 03:15.278
But there wasn't
just one female vigilante.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.280
- There are two of them.
- Get out of here.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.490
[Sallinger] Maybe taking back
the night or something.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.719
- [reporter 1] Other vigilante?
- Can you describe her?

03:21.743 --> 03:27.749
- [reporter 3] Who was the second person?
- Well, um... she hides behind a mask.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.211
She and Jessica Jones did this to me.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.379
[reporter 3] Sir, are you gonna be
pressing charges?

03:33.463 --> 03:37.217
I've worked hard
for every advantage that I have gotten.

03:37.300 --> 03:41.971
These powered people,
they feel entitled and they feel superior.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.808
They refer to themselves as heroes.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.144
But...

03:51.481 --> 03:54.234
But Jessica Jones did not save me,

03:54.317 --> 03:56.945
and she certainly didn't save
the victims at that train yard.

03:57.028 --> 03:57.946
[reporter 2] Ms. Jones!

03:58.029 --> 04:01.324
- Why did you attack Mr. Sallinger?
- [reporter 3] Who is your masked partner?

04:01.407 --> 04:03.952
The police arrested an innocent man,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.829
they kept him overnight
in a state of fear and intimidation.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.123
[reporters clamoring]

04:09.207 --> 04:11.584
[Jessica] <i>This is what happens
when you give a shit.</i>

04:12.710 --> 04:14.629
<i>The world flings it back at you.</i>

04:19.050 --> 04:21.386
Why the hell didn't you mention
the second super?

04:21.970 --> 04:23.513
The police wouldn't have believed me.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.057
I might have if you'd have
mentioned it to me,

04:26.140 --> 04:27.140
your defense attorney.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.019
You said you wanted to put this case
in the public eye.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.145
I just made headlines.

04:31.229 --> 04:35.733
By accusing Jessica of terrorizing you
and calling her a feminist vindicator.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.988
- I thought it would play to the base.
- Oh, it's base all right.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.242
- And slanderous.
- No. It's only slander if it's untrue.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.744
Don't forget, you're not the only one here
with a law degree.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.468
Oh, yeah? How many murder charges
have you had thrown out of court?

04:51.374 --> 04:55.086
The only time that I have ever failed
is when a client has undermined me.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.339
I don't like to fail.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.969
I take issue with unfounded arrogance.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.264
So start proving you're as good
as you say you are.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.350
You need me more than I need you.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.440
[engine starts]

05:26.868 --> 05:29.537
- Any calls from Kith Lyonne?
- No, but...

05:29.620 --> 05:32.999
He dismembered seven human beings.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.250
Allegedly.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.463
Sure. If it gets eyeballs
on your failing law firm, why not?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.797
You asshole.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.135
The press conference
was intended to balance

05:44.218 --> 05:46.429
the one-sided conversation
about Sallinger.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.057
He's a butcher. Conversation over.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.642
I didn't know that
he would call you out like that.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.353
Do you think I'm lying?

05:53.978 --> 05:57.482
Do you think that I just randomly decided
that he's a murderer?

05:57.565 --> 06:00.860
Do you think I invented
that he tried to kill me?

06:01.444 --> 06:05.031
Twice, Jeri. He came close both times.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.910
Now, I don't know
if we're friends or colleagues,

06:08.993 --> 06:11.579
or if we're just sharing a foxhole...

06:12.497 --> 06:16.000
- but do not make us adversaries.
- This isn't about you, Jessica.

06:16.084 --> 06:20.505
You called this place a failing firm
like it's meaningless.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.509
Well, it is meaningful to me.
And you know that.

06:25.259 --> 06:30.556
What I know is that when you
cozy up to maniacs, you get hurt.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.017
People around you get hurt.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.729
Well, even maniacs deserve
due process, don't they?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.065
Or does that only apply
when I'm representing you?

06:39.148 --> 06:40.149
[scoffs]

06:40.817 --> 06:43.319
You know, I'm trying
to meet you halfway here, Jeri.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.157
There's still a way this ends
with me respecting you.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.995
Honestly, you respecting me
is not my highest priority right now.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.416
So let's just
stay out of each other's way,

06:56.499 --> 06:57.917
and neither of us will get hurt.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.215
Well, looks like you finally found
someone to put you out of your misery.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.096
He just might enjoy it a bit too much.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.443
[sighs]

07:52.972 --> 07:54.223
[sighs]

08:03.774 --> 08:06.277
- [cell phone ringing]
- [sighs]

08:07.320 --> 08:09.363
I don't have time for you
to snap at me right now.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.866
I was a dick yesterday.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.577
You were trying to pick a fight. Why?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.454
[sighing] 'Cause I'm an idiot.

08:18.372 --> 08:22.668
- Can we talk? In person?
- I'm in the middle of something.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.836
Are you okay?

08:24.420 --> 08:27.340
I'm late. You wanna talk,
you know where I'll be.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.550
- Okay. I'll...
- [call disconnects]

08:29.634 --> 08:30.635
Zaya?

08:32.010 --> 08:33.221
[sighs]

08:34.764 --> 08:36.474
[sighs]

08:36.557 --> 08:39.143
- [lines ringing]
- Hold please. Hold please.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.688
Well, you don't have a choice.
Alias Investigations.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.944
Sallinger's press conference
is getting a lot of attention.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.111
Already?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.739
<i>They refer to themselves as heroes.</i>

08:51.822 --> 08:54.283
[Gillian] Hold please.
Alias Investigations.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.245
<i>But Jessica Jones didn't save me,</i>

08:57.328 --> 09:00.414
<i>and she certainly didn't save
the victims at that train yard.</i>

09:00.498 --> 09:02.625
All he's missing
is some foam at the mouth.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
<i>Why did you attack Mr. Sallinger?</i>

09:04.335 --> 09:05.836
<i>Who is your masked partner?</i>

09:05.920 --> 09:10.466
Yeah, I'm glad that that's preserved
for Internet eternity.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.887
I hate that you have to take
all this heat on your own.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.558
I'm starting to see
the benefits of wearing a mask.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.352
It's probably a little late to rebrand.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.522
[Gillian] Hold please. They keep asking
about this other vigilante girl.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.815
Sallinger's a liar.

09:26.524 --> 09:30.361
Complete fiction. Ms. Jones doesn't
like people enough to take on a partner.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.905
- Alias Investigations.
- Where's Erik?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.282
He took Brianna out of town.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.492
At least while Sallinger
is still roaming free.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.579
Wow. He really isn't into helping.

09:40.162 --> 09:44.041
He has an unstable sister to protect.
It's better they stay away.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.628
It's another interview request.
Rather stick a pin in your eye?

09:48.879 --> 09:50.172
Never gonna happen.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.719
Ugh. I've had to pee for the last hour.
Let it go to voice mail.

09:55.303 --> 10:00.141
Okay, so shadowing Sallinger
24/7 isn't viable. New plan?

10:07.732 --> 10:09.567
Or we just stare at this wall.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.203
What?

10:23.205 --> 10:27.251
I screwed up. When I first started
trying to do shit that matters.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.757
- I was wrong about Brandt.
- Ancient history. I'm over it.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.051
You screwed up, too.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.720
Well, everyone screws up
their first time out.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.680
Exactly.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.440
Sallinger's brother died
in a tractor accident.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.485
Maybe little Greggy
was just getting started.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.921
- Maybe he made a mistake.
- [Jessica] Call Wappinger Falls.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.531
I want the accident report
on Donny Sallinger's death.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.409
- Barky, barky.
- What are you doing?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.870
You got an overnight bag in your car?

11:03.454 --> 11:06.332
[Trish] Yeah, but someone should
keep an eye on Sallinger,

11:06.415 --> 11:07.667
at least from a distance.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.629
I thought you wanted to start
taking some of the heat, mix it up.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.715
Wappinger Falls
will not e-mail or fax records.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.385
All files must be examined
within the station walls.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.720
And that's a quote
from a prissy, bureaucratic hick

11:19.804 --> 11:21.430
clinging to her own little fiefdom.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.643
- Road trip.
- Exciting.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.897
- Here.
- What's this for?

11:29.980 --> 11:32.274
Gas station pumps. Full of E. coli.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.567
Superpowers.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.992
Whatever, I'll just take it.
It doesn't hurt to have it.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.588
- [knocking on door]
- [Zaya] Excuse me, Jeri?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.924
Do you remember our client Reid Pearson?

11:57.508 --> 12:00.928
Doing a six-year stint for date rape
after we got him off on the first offense.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.764
I actually took another look at his file
down at the 15th Precinct.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.476
He claims a masked woman attacked
and framed him. The cops didn't buy it.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.521
Mmm. Now Sallinger is waving
the masked woman flag.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.940
Maybe they are taking back the night.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.277
- Outside the law is still outside the law.
- Mmm.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.948
Go to Rikers and interview Reid.
See if the descriptions match. Yeah?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.119
[sighs]

12:25.202 --> 12:30.416
Um, I thought you might want to know
you accidentally texted me this.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.674
That's embarrassing.

12:39.425 --> 12:43.846
Believe me, I once missent a text
about genital warts to the DA, so...

12:43.929 --> 12:45.181
Not mine. I don't have...

12:45.264 --> 12:48.309
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.227
Be back by 1:00.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.022
Sallinger's gonna be coming
to sign some paperwork.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.863
- [door closes]
- [exhales]

13:26.096 --> 13:29.809
[Jessica] Why do serial killers
always come from small bucolic towns?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.812
I'm not sure that's a hard and fast rule.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.695
I'll go get the file.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.032
[Trish] Great. Love being your chauffeur.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.332
Jessica. Be nice.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.626
I am nice.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.759
[blows raspberry]

14:14.311 --> 14:16.188
Hello. How may I help you?

14:16.772 --> 14:19.483
Yeah, I'm a private investigator,
Jessica Jones.

14:19.567 --> 14:24.905
Um, 18 years ago, a resident of yours
was killed in a tractor accident.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.073
Donny Sallinger.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.868
I was hired by the tractor company
that settled with the Sallingers,

14:28.951 --> 14:30.661
so I'd like to take a look at that report.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.748
I can confirm Donny
rolled over his dad's tractor.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.250
He was crushed underneath.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.879
That must have been
a terrible shock for his family.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.672
It sure was.

14:44.049 --> 14:49.346
And... Gregory Sallinger,
Donny's brother, was he there?

14:50.055 --> 14:51.974
Greg was on a school trip.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.268
I was the deputy they sent
to bring him home.

14:54.351 --> 14:57.271
Did the police investigate
the possibility of foul play?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.607
It was a tractor turnover.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.278
Is there a reason why you
don't want to show me that file?

15:05.321 --> 15:08.616
Is there a reason why you're pretending
to work for the tractor company?

15:09.867 --> 15:12.161
I did a search when your office called.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.333
<i>Ms. Jones! Did you attack him in his home?</i>

15:17.416 --> 15:19.835
It's on the Internet, so it must be true.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.212
Look, lady, or whatever you are...

15:22.296 --> 15:23.464
Whatever I am?

15:27.468 --> 15:28.677
Your little Greg...

15:30.095 --> 15:31.805
he killed seven people.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.808
Not the boy I knew.

15:34.892 --> 15:38.729
- Donny was his first.
- He wasn't.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.150
But Donny's dad lost his mind to grief
after Donny died.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.902
He took it out on Greg.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.113
I couldn't protect the boy back then.
I can now.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.868
How about protecting
the rest of us from him?

15:52.952 --> 15:56.956
He's just one human man.
You're something else.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.667
You're not gonna show me
that report, are you?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.418
Not without a court order.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.008
Do you mind?

16:08.759 --> 16:10.052
Long drive.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.074
[car alarm blaring]

16:33.659 --> 16:35.744
[Trish] God damn it! No!

16:41.000 --> 16:44.378
- [Trish] Oh, my God! Help!
- [Velasco] I don't like the sound of that.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.799
Somebody help! Oh, God!

16:51.385 --> 16:52.862
- Oh, my God!
- [Velasco] Are you okay?

16:52.886 --> 16:54.888
[Trish] Oh, my God! I'm not!

16:54.972 --> 16:57.349
- [Velasco] Ma'am, are you all right?
- I'm not all right!

16:57.433 --> 17:00.686
I accidentally dropped the keys,
and now I can't even find them.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.689
- And the alarm is, like, "Beep!"
- Have look in the back. It's all right!

17:07.776 --> 17:11.405
- Oh, God! It's so loud! So loud!
- You're fine. Okay. You'll be all right!

17:11.488 --> 17:14.366
Oh, my ears! Oh!

17:19.371 --> 17:20.372
In the front?

17:20.455 --> 17:23.083
Yeah. I am psychologically shutting down!

17:26.002 --> 17:27.003
[car alarm continues]

17:27.087 --> 17:29.381
Oh, God. This is very triggering for me.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.175
[Velasco] It's gonna be okay.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.311
- Hey, Char, have you seen Zaya?
- The new client meeting.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.688
Nasty shiner.

17:51.487 --> 17:55.491
[Sallinger] They're the real threat.
Jessica Jones and her cohorts.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.887
- Blaming me for their unchecked violence.
- Who's the client?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.930
- [telephone ringing]
- [Char] Hogarth & Associates.

18:00.954 --> 18:04.458
[Sallinger] People regard
these superheroes as if they're gods,

18:04.541 --> 18:09.546
but really... they're just casualties
of biochemical mishaps.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.547
They're not real.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.050
[Hogarth] Regardless,
Jessica won't stop pursuing you.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.430
But she despises being in the public eye,
so we have that working for us.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.849
As for the masked woman,
she has attacked before.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.393
We have a client in prison
who can confirm that.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.077
[Hogarth] So that's an advantage for us.

18:25.104 --> 18:30.400
But if you have anything damaging
in your history, Jessica will uncover it.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.445
Now is the time to disclose it.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.240
You admire her, don't you?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.827
You carry on like a true fan.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.910
Mmm.

18:41.829 --> 18:48.752
I have found her extremely effective,
formidable... unwavering.

18:49.628 --> 18:53.715
- Underestimating her would be a mistake.
- [Sallinger] As would overestimating her.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.427
She doesn't understand
the value of hard work.

18:57.511 --> 19:01.014
Not like we do.
We have earned our respect.

19:02.057 --> 19:07.271
You, from a trailer park to
a Manhattan law firm with your name on it.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.354
Twice.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.111
And you, Harvard Law.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.781
<i>Magna cum laude,</i> no less.
Must be that Virginia work ethic...

19:17.865 --> 19:18.865
Sorry I'm late.

19:18.907 --> 19:22.494
Mr. Sallinger, we haven't met.
Malcolm Ducasse.

19:23.370 --> 19:27.624
[Hogarth] Mr. Ducasse is our
in-house investigator and security expert.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.836
You didn't tell me he was part
of the team. I like to be prepared.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.713
I'm an open book.
What do you want to know?

19:32.796 --> 19:34.923
He has trained
under Jessica Jones as well.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.176
And your allegiance?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.469
To me and mine.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.642
Now, does your job often result
in a periorbital hematoma?

19:45.726 --> 19:48.896
No. But I'm not afraid of a fight
for the right cause.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.900
We'll see.

19:52.983 --> 19:57.529
Now that you're officially a client of
Hogarth & Associates, let us get to work.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.072
Let me... Let me show you out.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.625
No.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.211
- "No"?
- Just no.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.800
I believe the phrase
that you're looking for is,

20:14.838 --> 20:19.426
"I have absolutely no say whatsoever
in which cases you do or do not take."

20:19.509 --> 20:20.844
And what happened to your face?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.888
Come on, Zaya.
You're gonna help him keep killing.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.033
I'm doing my job, Malcolm.
You should try it sometime.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.601
- I was doing a job for Jessica.
- Oh, Jesus. Jessica?

20:27.684 --> 20:29.965
You're the one who always says
trouble follows that woman.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.773
- Case in point, your face.
- The job gets complicated sometimes.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.360
That's it. You tell me what
your problem is right now, or we're done.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.696
My problem is that my woman
is in business with a psycho killer.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.032
Alleged. I've used that word enough,

20:42.115 --> 20:44.451
you should've comprehended
its meaning by now.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.623
Look... he already knows
too much about both of you.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.877
Okay. He did look up
my grade school records.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.298
But it is not our job
to assess guilt or innocence.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.053
Look into the masked woman.
See if there are any more reports.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.056
I already called over to the 15th,
but I will follow up now.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.725
- Great.
- I'll do background on Sallinger.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.812
- Malcolm...
- It is my job to assess and manage risk.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.065
Sallinger will bring
a lot of exposure to your firm.

21:15.148 --> 21:18.026
- I just wanna make sure it stays positive.
- Start digging.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.696
And let me know
if he's about to do something stupid.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.490
- Like kill someone?
- Way to be objective.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.910
- I prefer vigilant.
- Okay. Do we have a problem here?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.621
Not at all.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.088
If you have an issue,
you need to keep it to yourself.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.841
I need you both at the top of your game.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.474
[cell phone vibrating]

21:53.562 --> 21:55.897
Hello? Kith?

21:55.981 --> 21:59.568
[woman] <i>Congratulations! You are eligible
for a free upgrade to your operating...</i>

22:06.700 --> 22:08.118
The only crimes in this town

22:08.201 --> 22:11.538
are teen vandalism,
noise complaints and petty theft.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.248
Sallinger didn't leave much of a mark.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.500
No, he did. We just haven't found it yet.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.756
But, apparently,
tractor rollovers are totally a thing.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.634
[sighs]

22:28.430 --> 22:33.185
Another fifth of bourbon won't help you
turn Donny's death into a murder.

22:35.771 --> 22:39.983
- It's a process.
- Neither will this wilted salad.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.527
You know, you don't
have to eat that shit anymore.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.864
You're powered now.
Your body can process a Cheeto or two.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.992
Yeah, I'm not a fan
of anything that orange.

22:49.576 --> 22:50.952
God. What if we're wrong?

22:52.162 --> 22:55.290
God knows what Sallinger's doing
right now. Or who he's targeting.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.502
Well, this is how we stop him.
By turning over every stone.

22:58.585 --> 23:02.047
Well, all I've done
is play the vapid dumb blond.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.132
- [Jessica] Which was helpful.
- [scoffs]

23:06.593 --> 23:10.222
At a certain point, if 90% of your life
is playing the cover, then...

23:11.848 --> 23:13.058
you are the cover.

23:14.267 --> 23:18.605
Well, you could be out and proud
and have everyone hate you. It's way fun.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.318
You remember when it finally came out

23:23.402 --> 23:27.864
that I was an abject drug addict,
four-time rehab failure?

23:27.948 --> 23:29.741
- Unfortunately.
- [chuckles]

23:30.659 --> 23:34.704
Actually, it was good.
I could finally breathe.

23:38.208 --> 23:42.087
You sobbed for three days straight
and ended up in a catatonic depression.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.715
But it was worth it
for the freedom that I felt after that.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.219
I could finally be me,

23:51.138 --> 23:55.517
even if everybody looked at me
like I was damaged goods.

23:58.645 --> 24:03.024
I can't imagine what it feels like
to have people look at you with hope...

24:05.402 --> 24:06.528
respect.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.822
Neither can I.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.366
Well, they will.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.327
When we finally nail
this depraved whack job.

24:15.203 --> 24:18.665
So Donny wasn't his first kill,
then who was?

24:20.333 --> 24:21.376
All yours.

24:30.969 --> 24:31.970
[Zaya] Hey.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.307
- You look tired.
- Hmm.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.476
Consistent with how I feel.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.729
I found something.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.565
Have a seat.

24:48.695 --> 24:52.991
Police records show that five felons
claim that a masked female vigilante

24:53.074 --> 24:55.285
assaulted, tricked or framed them.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.122
One of them being Reid Pearson.
But all five are guilty as sin.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.500
Well, good. That shores up our argument.

25:01.583 --> 25:08.340
Except that three of the five happen to be
our current or former clients.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.637
That can't be a coincidence.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.015
[scoffs]

25:18.016 --> 25:21.561
She's... She's targeting us. God damn it!

25:22.103 --> 25:24.898
Yeah, I reamed a bike messenger
on my way over here.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.734
Well, some things
merit losing your shit over.

25:28.693 --> 25:32.364
Somehow, this woman
has access to my client files.

25:32.447 --> 25:33.865
I'll check with Malcolm

25:33.949 --> 25:36.427
and see if he can figure out
if there were security breaches...

25:36.451 --> 25:40.956
No, you... you found this,
I need you to follow it through.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.712
Okay, uh, I can review security tapes.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.507
But I think that Malcolm's
better equipped...

25:50.590 --> 25:51.841
Malcolm's plate is full.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.262
And I'm gonna be leaning on you
until you say when.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.014
Don't know the meaning of the word.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.641
Good.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.108
[winces]

26:12.988 --> 26:13.989
[Trish] Jess?

26:15.865 --> 26:17.033
Hey, Jess, wake up.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.287
- Mmm, five more minutes.
- I... I think I found a lead.

26:23.498 --> 26:24.583
Just read it.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.669
Nathan Silva
was on the high school wrestling team...

26:27.752 --> 26:29.045
With Sallinger?

26:29.129 --> 26:33.216
They were friends right up until
senior year when Nathan went missing.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.765
[elevator dings]

26:47.105 --> 26:48.106
Where's Jessica?

26:48.189 --> 26:51.610
- Good Lord. Are you trying to kill me?
- She didn't come home last night.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.862
- She's away on business.
- Sallinger business?

26:54.696 --> 26:57.866
- Do I even know you?
- I'm Malcolm Ducasse.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.451
The old me.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.580
I need everything that she has
on Gregory Sallinger.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.040
No.

27:10.378 --> 27:14.090
Look, I'm helping her.
She'll be relieved. Trust me.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.009
Mr. Ducasse, if you...

27:16.092 --> 27:21.389
When you were in my position,
if a man, albeit a handsome man,

27:21.973 --> 27:23.433
accosted you in the hallway,

27:23.516 --> 27:26.019
didn't apologize
for your near cardiac arrest

27:26.102 --> 27:28.521
and then forced his way
into your place of work,

27:28.605 --> 27:32.484
would you hand over anything to him,
much less a very sensitive investigation,

27:32.567 --> 27:34.819
just because he said,
"Jessica will be relieved"?

27:35.528 --> 27:37.781
That's not exactly
a notarized release form.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.950
[sighs]

27:58.134 --> 28:01.012
Their son has been missing for 15 years.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.808
I'm about to rip that wound right open.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.143
They'll want to know.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.604
[cell phone vibrating]

28:09.688 --> 28:10.689
Gillian.

28:11.272 --> 28:14.109
I'll take it. I'll see if it's important.
You'll be fine.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.202
Hey, Gill. It's Trish.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.955
[Malcolm] <i>Trish, where's Jess?
I'm taking on the Sallinger case.</i>

28:29.416 --> 28:31.126
You must be very proud.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.211
No, I'm not with Hogarth on this one.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.505
But she still signs your paychecks?

28:36.631 --> 28:38.299
His expression says yes.

28:38.383 --> 28:42.345
Look, Hogarth will do whatever it takes
to keep her firm afloat,

28:42.429 --> 28:45.432
but putting a serial killer back
on the streets, that's where I get off.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.893
I'd hope so.
But Jessica and I are on this.

28:48.977 --> 28:49.978
We're close.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.480
Meanwhile, Sallinger is free
to stalk and kill.

28:52.564 --> 28:56.317
<i>He knows the cops are onto him.
He'll probably lay low for a while.</i>

28:56.401 --> 28:59.654
That arrogant prick? I am not taking
that chance. I'm gonna keep eyes on him.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.490
And I would like access
to Jessica's background on him.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.493
But I'm in this regardless,
and I don't need your permission.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.996
[Gillian] <i>I do. If he's gonna see files.</i>

29:09.038 --> 29:13.001
You'll keep us updated.
Yeah, check in every hour?

29:13.084 --> 29:14.294
[scoffs]

29:15.378 --> 29:16.504
His expression says,

29:16.588 --> 29:18.941
"You're treating me like a child,
and it hurts my feelings."

29:18.965 --> 29:19.965
It does not.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.386
<i>- Show him the files, Gillian.</i>
- I'll need Jessica's okay.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.722
I have her proxy.

29:41.946 --> 29:46.701
[Jessica] <i>The only thing worse than people
looking at you like you're a monster</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:49.412
<i>is when they look at you
like you're their savior.</i>

29:50.371 --> 29:52.957
They, uh... Him and Nathan were like this.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.464
- Did they ever have a falling-out?
- Only once.

29:59.547 --> 30:03.259
When Nathan started
getting some, uh, recruiting offers.

30:04.177 --> 30:08.681
Greg was envious.
But wrestling came easy to Nathan.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.601
He was gifted. So Greg got over it.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.853
[chuckling]

30:13.937 --> 30:16.648
They were always making up
their own moves, you know?

30:16.731 --> 30:19.192
The Half-Wappinger,
the Double Half-Wappinger.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.069
- Manuel.
- Eh?

30:21.152 --> 30:23.488
Is that it? We're trying to catch a movie.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.448
Uh, excuse me.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.326
[both arguing in Spanish]

30:46.427 --> 30:48.054
[arguing continues]

31:03.611 --> 31:04.946
Did Greg take this photo?

31:05.530 --> 31:08.867
Uh, uh-huh. He sent it the Christmas
after Nathan...

31:09.826 --> 31:11.411
uh, went away.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.250
- This was taken right out back?
- [Manuel] Yes.

31:21.045 --> 31:25.258
- When was that gazebo built?
- No. No. No more.

31:25.341 --> 31:28.177
- We're done, Ms. Jones.
- [Manuel] It's okay, Ana.

31:29.721 --> 31:33.558
It was built the...
the day Nathan disappeared.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.977
The whole team came to help.

31:36.936 --> 31:42.734
I thought Nathan just...
skipped out on the... on the work.

31:42.817 --> 31:45.194
- [crying]
- [Ana speaking Spanish]

31:48.239 --> 31:53.077
You people come here and dig up pain.
Police, FBI, private investigators.

31:53.161 --> 31:56.581
It hurts worse when you don't know
what really happened to your family.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.918
It doesn't matter. He's never coming back.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.210
Not if you don't look.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.632
Ana.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.681
[cell phone vibrating]

32:20.897 --> 32:22.106
[sighs]

32:25.902 --> 32:27.445
Ugh.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.076
[scoffs]

32:34.035 --> 32:35.036
[drops phone]

32:47.840 --> 32:49.008
[sighs]

32:56.265 --> 32:57.475
[scoffs]

32:58.935 --> 33:01.270
Did Greg help build that gazebo?

33:01.354 --> 33:03.064
He stayed the whole day.

33:04.607 --> 33:08.736
He was worried about Nathan, too.
He was a good boy.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.220
- [knock on door]
- [Velasco] Hello?

33:11.364 --> 33:13.074
[Ana] Ronnie. Thank God.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.452
Ana asked me stop by.
Everything all right?

33:16.536 --> 33:18.204
Ms. Jones is here to help us.

33:18.871 --> 33:20.164
Is that what she's doing?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.126
Did she tell you
she's one of those superpowered people?

33:23.209 --> 33:24.460
Is that a crime in this town?

33:25.128 --> 33:27.088
It's time for you to move on.

33:27.171 --> 33:31.592
No, she can find him.
No, she can help. She can find him.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.928
Hey... Hey! Where are you going?

33:34.012 --> 33:36.139
[Manuel] Wait a minute. What is she doing?

33:36.639 --> 33:37.557
Keep them in the house.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.642
- What is she doing?
- No, no! Stay in the house.

33:39.726 --> 33:43.396
Stay back, Manuel. Back in the house.
Back in the house. Stay there.

33:43.479 --> 33:44.479
[Ana] This is our home.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.562
- You can't let her do this. Please!
- [Velasco] I'm trying to keep you safe.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.952
What do you think you're doing?

34:00.079 --> 34:04.417
Jessica Jones, I need you to step away.
This is private property.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.591
- Put your hands up!
- Stay back.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.012
Up, now!

34:16.679 --> 34:18.306
[Jessica] I'm not stopping.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.245
[Velasco] Listen to me! Put your hands up!

34:33.321 --> 34:34.822
Put your hands up!

34:37.949 --> 34:40.620
Don't shoot! You're on camera.

34:40.703 --> 34:41.788
Put that down!

34:42.914 --> 34:44.081
[Trish] Not a chance.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.001
Stop what you're doing!

34:56.052 --> 34:57.178
What did you find?

35:13.945 --> 35:16.405
[wailing] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

35:16.489 --> 35:20.034
- He was... here?
- [sobbing] Oh... Oh, no!

35:20.535 --> 35:24.539
[crying] Oh, no! No, my God!

35:29.418 --> 35:30.670
No!

35:34.715 --> 35:37.677
Oh, my God! No.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.388
[Manuel sobbing]

35:59.407 --> 36:02.285
It's his first kill.
There's gotta be DNA all over it.

36:02.368 --> 36:05.454
[Costa] <i>If it's there, we'll find it.
But I've gotta run this up the ladder.</i>

36:05.538 --> 36:07.790
How soon can you get
the body to your crime lab?

36:07.874 --> 36:11.252
<i>I've gotta make a case
that Sallinger is an NYPD collar.</i>

36:11.335 --> 36:13.129
- Okay. Let me know.
<i>- Thanks, Jones.</i>

36:15.339 --> 36:16.382
Costa?

36:16.465 --> 36:18.926
He's filing for jurisdiction
over the body.

36:20.052 --> 36:23.097
All these years,
and their son was under their feet.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.808
We'll stay on Sallinger
until the police drag him in.

36:26.893 --> 36:27.894
[Velasco] Hey.

36:29.228 --> 36:31.063
I'd like my files back.

36:45.119 --> 36:49.248
Bobby McBurty stole the snowblower.
His statement didn't add up.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.333
I know.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.794
But sometimes you gotta let things slide.

36:54.921 --> 36:55.922
Anyway...

36:57.340 --> 36:58.340
thank you.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.679
You have a nice day now.

37:22.114 --> 37:24.367
Are you still a hero
if nobody thinks you are?

37:25.451 --> 37:27.578
Like I give a shit
what other people think.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.545
[engine starts]

37:50.977 --> 37:51.978
[Zaya sighs]

37:56.107 --> 37:59.652
Want to drink. Want to sleep.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.174
Shit.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.270
Oh, my God.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.036
[inaudible]

39:00.129 --> 39:01.297
What the hell?

39:09.138 --> 39:11.140
[indistinct conversations]

40:05.444 --> 40:07.405
[scoffs] What am I doing?

40:07.488 --> 40:08.823
[chuckling softly]

40:22.503 --> 40:24.130
[line ringing]

40:25.256 --> 40:28.801
- [woman] New York Bulletin.
- Hi. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm calling in a tip.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.764
[Sallinger] All right, guys,
let's gather up here, take a knee.

40:34.807 --> 40:38.269
Sophia, let's see you demo this for us.

40:39.228 --> 40:42.982
Nice and slow, right?
No need to hurry. Not live here.

40:43.065 --> 40:47.069
Focused on precision,
accuracy, each move. Right?

40:47.153 --> 40:48.988
[kids grunting]

40:50.739 --> 40:53.075
[Sallinger] How we looking over here?
All right, now, look.

40:53.659 --> 40:57.705
When we're on the bottom,
we gotta... Wider than that. Right?

40:58.497 --> 40:59.707
Okay, go ahead.

40:59.790 --> 41:03.210
Okay, wider, guys. Wider, right?
Bend your elbows.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.546
Go ahead and grip strong.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.799
Grip that strong, right? Hey, when you...
When you clear him, post.

41:09.675 --> 41:12.803
Left ear on the back, right?
Just try to get a hold of that.

41:14.388 --> 41:17.600
God damn it! What are you doing here?

41:17.683 --> 41:20.436
You want to get involved,
expect to have your phone tracked.

41:22.271 --> 41:25.774
It's insane that that deranged murderer
is teaching little kids.

41:27.610 --> 41:31.280
- [Sallinger] Get your head up. Head up.
- Insane. Sickening.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.523
- [Sallinger] Get your head up, right?
- Rage inducing.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.118
We're clearing this hand.
Clear that hand. Clear. All right?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.205
There you go.
And don't look down. Look ahead.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.665
But we found what we needed upstate.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.710
- We got him.
- [chuckles softly]

41:46.378 --> 41:49.381
All right.
Been waiting to hear some good news.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.717
- When are they bringing him in?
- Not soon enough.

41:53.469 --> 41:55.387
We just keep eyes on him until then.

41:56.430 --> 41:57.431
"We"?

41:59.099 --> 42:00.559
Don't you have a job?

42:01.602 --> 42:04.563
There is what I have to do
to maintain a life

42:05.147 --> 42:08.150
and what I want to do,
and I need both to stay sane.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.277
[Sallinger] Get a drink.
Go ahead and get a drink.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.617
Go ahead, guys. Now clear that arm.

42:32.925 --> 42:33.925
Oh, shit.

42:56.282 --> 42:59.159
So you hone your skills on 12-year-olds.

42:59.243 --> 43:04.290
Well, they work hard. They have integrity.
Two foreign concepts to you.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.001
These kids have had
enough lessons from you.

43:07.084 --> 43:08.210
Call it a day.

43:09.169 --> 43:12.006
Cheat them of their training?
There's not a chance.

43:12.089 --> 43:15.634
Coach, the...
the other kid took my partner.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.886
You don't need a partner to improve.
It's all right.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.555
Practice your top stance, okay?

43:19.638 --> 43:21.265
- [boy] Okay.
- Go ahead.

43:25.269 --> 43:28.314
You want to assault me again? In public?

43:29.231 --> 43:31.275
Not if you get the hell away
from these kids.

43:31.358 --> 43:34.653
Or what? You'll beat me to a pulp?

43:35.279 --> 43:38.365
Relying on an unfair advantage, again?

43:38.949 --> 43:43.662
Or maybe you actually think...
that you can fight a fair fight.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.459
The rules are simple.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.254
You don't want to do that.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.552
You can't control yourself.

43:59.261 --> 44:02.640
You have no discipline. Just brute force.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.475
You want me to kick your ass.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.646
You think I'll lose my shit
in front of these cameras.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.314
It is in your nature.

44:12.441 --> 44:15.986
And people want to know the truth.
Especially yours.

44:20.532 --> 44:23.202
Maybe people like to see
someone fight back

44:23.285 --> 44:26.246
against a psychopath that destroys lives.

44:40.135 --> 44:41.178
School me.

44:43.263 --> 44:45.599
You want to make sure I'm playing fair.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.008
Holy shit.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.512
[camera shutter clicking]

45:48.537 --> 45:49.872
[whistle blows]

45:49.955 --> 45:51.623
All right, guys, take a breather.

45:52.416 --> 45:53.667
Everybody over here.

45:54.626 --> 45:55.961
Have a seat.

45:56.044 --> 45:57.212
Okay.

45:57.796 --> 46:04.261
You get disqualified for kicking,
scratching, biting, hitting, swearing,

46:04.344 --> 46:06.764
when you slam
your opponent's body to the mat

46:06.847 --> 46:10.601
or you twist any body part
beyond its normal range of motion.

46:11.226 --> 46:13.187
Other than that, it's pretty simple.

46:13.771 --> 46:16.565
First person to pin
their opponent to the mat wins.

46:17.441 --> 46:18.441
Got it.

46:18.901 --> 46:23.238
I won't ask you to go easy on me,
'cause I know you won't.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.116
Go.

46:29.828 --> 46:31.038
[Sallinger chuckles]

46:32.498 --> 46:33.499
Okay.

46:34.583 --> 46:38.504
You also get disqualified for passivity
if you don't do anything.

46:39.546 --> 46:42.090
I'm just waiting on you
to show me some moves.

46:42.174 --> 46:43.258
Oh, okay.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.185
[all gasp]

46:53.644 --> 46:54.644
[Sallinger grunts]

46:57.981 --> 46:59.233
[both panting]

46:59.316 --> 47:02.736
Come on. You can't hold back forever.
It's not you.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.820
Count it out!

47:03.862 --> 47:06.740
- [boy] One, two, three...
- Is this the hold you used to kill Nathan?

47:06.824 --> 47:09.243
...four, five.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.161
[groans]

47:11.245 --> 47:13.163
[cheers and applause]

47:15.749 --> 47:18.377
All that practice, and you still suck ass.

47:20.212 --> 47:22.214
[kids cheering]

47:32.474 --> 47:34.017
[breathing heavily]

47:45.696 --> 47:48.407
All they see is a cheater.

47:49.241 --> 47:51.159
Now who's lying to themselves?

47:52.035 --> 47:54.454
[grunts, groaning]

48:04.339 --> 48:07.467
No body slams. I guess I lose.

48:08.093 --> 48:11.638
They'll see who you are. They'll all see.

48:12.806 --> 48:13.807
Let them.

48:16.643 --> 48:17.769
Class dismissed.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.271
[all cheering]

48:27.029 --> 48:29.031
[upbeat music playing]
