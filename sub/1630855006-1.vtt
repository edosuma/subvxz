01:29.674 --> 01:30.675
Tan dy: Conwell!

01:30.758 --> 01:32.218
Conwell: Say I promise.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.302
Tan dy: Conwell!

01:34.553 --> 01:35.554
Stop!

01:36.347 --> 01:38.432
You're not scared out here, like, at all?

01:44.063 --> 01:45.273
Tandy: I always liked...

01:45.356 --> 01:46.691
I liked the way they smell.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.317
Conwell: Yeah, tents are great.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.278
My favorite. I love it.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.031
I used to take my daughters camping too.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.574
Tandy: Stop!

02:09.714 --> 02:11.048
Is it big?

02:11.132 --> 02:12.341
Are you going to say yes?

02:13.050 --> 02:14.844
Tandy: |'|| say yes if it's big.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.563
Conwell: I may have to make you wait
if you don't promise to say yes.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.231
Tan dy: I don't want to wait!

02:29.442 --> 02:30.609
Conwell: Oh, come on.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.696
Say I promise.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.782
Come on.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.870
I'll show you if you promise to say yes.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.998
I promise to say yes
if you promise it's big.

02:45.708 --> 02:48.878
If it's big, like big big,
then I'll say yes.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.379
Conwell: Ready?

02:51.130 --> 02:52.465
Tandy: It's so big!

02:52.548 --> 02:53.883
- Told you.
- You did.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.012
What do you say?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.347
I say yes.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.486
Tandy: Help me!

05:25.534 --> 05:26.619
Missy: How was the ocean?

05:27.036 --> 05:29.914
- Reese: Wavy.
- Missy: Wavy isn't a word, dear.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.624
Reese: Wavy is totally a word.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.084
Missy: This is my new favorite beer.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.188
Every beer is your new favorite beer.

05:36.212 --> 05:38.506
I am so excited Audra is coming home.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.840
Do you think she'll stay?

05:39.924 --> 05:40.925
No, most likely not.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.802
But it would be so good
having her home for a while.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.971
- Yeah, it will be.
- The real question is,

05:46.055 --> 05:48.909
what's Haley going to think of her
little sister coming back to west craven?

05:48.933 --> 05:50.893
It's so sad that they hate each other.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.978
Yeah, well,
it's a hate of mutual tolerance,

05:53.062 --> 05:54.742
so I'm sure everything's going to be fine.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.166
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

05:56.190 --> 05:57.775
With those two?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.485
Who knows?

06:03.197 --> 06:04.323
Devon: Spin around.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.283
How about lover boy over there?

06:08.661 --> 06:10.496
How do you think
he feels that Audra's back?

06:10.579 --> 06:13.791
Probably not great, but I don't think
they've spoken since she left.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.875
Yikes.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.252
Devon: Hey.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.938
Now blow me a kiss.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.591
Okay, I'll talk to him.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.532
I don't think we're supposed
to have bottles on the beach.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.684
Not yet. Also not a nude beach, either.
But who's counting?

06:31.767 --> 06:34.270
Every time we come here,
somebody has to get topless.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.479
Come on.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.730
Let's go make friends.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.110
Ouch!

06:41.193 --> 06:43.112
Shells!

06:43.195 --> 06:44.405
Can't be so so

06:45.906 --> 06:47.241
this is your show

06:48.617 --> 06:49.952
here we go go

06:51.912 --> 06:52.913
go go

06:53.247 --> 06:55.499
skinny dip skinn y ties

06:56.000 --> 06:58.377
skinny those skinn y fries

06:58.669 --> 07:01.088
skinny bitch to my right

07:01.171 --> 07:03.173
it's no surprise

07:04.258 --> 07:06.510
tap tap, Instagram

07:06.969 --> 07:09.305
name drop, name brand

07:09.722 --> 07:12.057
fairy dust, fairy/and

07:12.808 --> 07:14.685
oh tha-that's how they like it

07:16.061 --> 07:17.479
can't be so so

07:18.897 --> 07:19.982
this is your show

07:21.525 --> 07:22.901
here we go go

07:24.862 --> 07:28.073
go go dive into bright lights

07:28.157 --> 07:30.200
say your goodbyes

07:30.284 --> 07:33.495
stepped right into the riptide

07:33.579 --> 07:35.581
a cold lullaby

07:35.664 --> 07:38.917
and I'm drowning in your love

07:39.168 --> 07:41.879
glowing in the dark, baby

07:41.962 --> 07:44.506
it's kill or be killed

07:44.590 --> 07:46.759
swimming with the sharks

07:48.135 --> 07:50.471
be the first or the best

07:50.846 --> 07:53.140
who's now, who's next?

07:53.599 --> 07:55.893
Ding ding, messages

07:55.976 --> 07:57.936
leave me alone

07:59.063 --> 08:01.398
lose the weight, lose the smirk

08:01.815 --> 08:04.151
pretty soon you lose the shirt

08:04.485 --> 08:06.820
better win, better work

08:07.571 --> 08:09.573
or you might as well go home

08:10.908 --> 08:12.242
can't be so so

08:13.661 --> 08:14.828
this is your show

08:16.372 --> 08:17.873
here we go go

08:19.667 --> 08:22.878
go go dive into bright lights

08:23.087 --> 08:25.172
say your goodbyes

08:25.255 --> 08:28.425
stepped right into the riptide

08:28.509 --> 08:30.511
a cold lullaby

08:30.594 --> 08:33.722
and I'm drowning in your love

08:34.056 --> 08:36.767
glowing in the dark, baby

08:36.850 --> 08:39.436
it's kill or be killed

08:39.520 --> 08:41.605
swimming with the sharks

08:42.356 --> 08:45.025
dive into bright lights
can't be so so

08:45.109 --> 08:47.027
bright bright, bright light

08:47.194 --> 08:50.948
stepped right into the riptide
here we go go

08:52.491 --> 08:55.911
and I'm drowning in your love
can't be so so

08:55.994 --> 08:58.706
glowing in the dark, baby

08:58.789 --> 09:01.458
it's kill or be killed
here we go go

09:01.542 --> 09:03.627
swimming with the sharks

09:04.128 --> 09:06.922
got what you asked for
can't be so so

09:07.005 --> 09:09.383
now you only need more
this is your show

09:09.466 --> 09:12.386
you got what you asked for
here we go go

09:12.469 --> 09:15.305
but you only need more go go

09:25.023 --> 09:26.024
Spin around.

09:29.445 --> 09:30.612
Let's grab you a beer.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.156
- Yes.
- Hey!

09:32.239 --> 09:34.658
- And a top of some sort?
- I'll be right back, babe.

09:34.783 --> 09:35.868
Missy: Maybe shorts too.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.202
You guys ruin everything.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.996
Yeah, right. Come on.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.583
Devon: Fine, I could use a beer anyway.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.467
You need to get over it.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.427
I told her what would happen
if she came back.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.596
What, Devon?
What is going to happen?

09:55.679 --> 09:57.389
You don't understand where she left it.

09:57.473 --> 09:59.057
No, I think I understand pretty well.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.476
Yeah, you think you do.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.978
Regardless of what happened,
you got what you deserved.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.773
- Whatever.
- You know, you were a real dick, Devon.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.192
Oh, so Audra just gets total absolution.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.027
Uh, yeah, pretty much.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.487
Okay, even still,

10:11.570 --> 10:14.490
I can't just abide by the fact
that she bought the tupp house.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.908
Okay? That can't stand.

10:15.991 --> 10:16.992
Why not?

10:17.075 --> 10:19.369
Because I'm a tupp after all.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.913
You are not a tupp.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.832
- My third cousin married into...
- Never married a tupp.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.417
You are no kind of tupp.

10:25.501 --> 10:28.670
Damn it, missy. I...
She has to regret coming back here.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.215
No, she doesn't.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.302
We'll see.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.138
We'll see nothing.
Besides, why do you even care?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.474
You have a pretty
new girlfriend now, anyway.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.519
- Autumn: Hey, baby.
- Hey, babe.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.354
Let's go!

10:45.896 --> 10:46.897
Giddy up!

10:47.147 --> 10:49.024
Whoa.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.294
- Reese: How did the talk go?
- Autumn: Oh, my god!

10:51.318 --> 10:53.654
- As expected.
- So, terribly?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.155
Pretty much.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.262
What's the worst that could happen?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.746
Yeah, keep saying that.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.831
Come on.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.558
Reese: At least you have
a new favorite beer.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.222
Missy: Yeah, well, at least there's that.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.794
Reese: Shotgun!

11:26.854 --> 11:30.691
What's with these homies
who be dissin' my boy?

11:30.774 --> 11:31.942
Do they know?

11:32.025 --> 11:36.446
I'm aggravated with the negativity
and the noise

11:36.530 --> 11:41.159
they tell me "find a wealthy man"

11:41.243 --> 11:45.122
but they don't seem too happy

11:45.330 --> 11:50.168
I was afraid to put myself
on the line for a boy...

11:50.794 --> 11:51.795
Amazing.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.172
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.895
And that's enough from you.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.027
Key.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.047
The rest of you can wait.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.388
And you...

12:44.139 --> 12:45.265
I forgot about you.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.893
What do I do with you?

12:49.645 --> 12:51.146
A place to do acid, I suppose.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.150
Or tear you down
and put in a hot tub.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.244
Bingo.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.538
Bingo.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.849
And you are all mine.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.703
I should call daddy.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.736
Conwell: Hello.
You've reached conwell's voicemail.

14:44.760 --> 14:45.927
Please leave a message.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.804
Unless it's one of you kids
who needs money.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.389
In that case, call your mother.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.934
She likes to hear from you guys once
in a while when you don't need money.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.145
And aften/vards, call gramps too.

14:56.313 --> 15:00.233
Anyways, I just arrived,
and it's amazing.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.319
I can never thank you enough.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.280
I can't believe they let us
keep all the furniture.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.076
I'm having the girls over later,
so I'll see you tomorrow.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.702
Love you.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.750
Today is a great day.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.418
Oh, shit!

15:19.044 --> 15:20.587
I'm wrecking this place already.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.185
There.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.311
Good as new.

15:53.829 --> 15:56.123
Oh, it's so comfortable.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.795
I never want to get up. Ugh.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.801
Fuck me.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.102
Beautiful.

16:36.788 --> 16:37.789
Hmm.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.667
I need to get my bags from the trunk.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.212
And take a shower.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.567
Oh, my god.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.739
I don't see how anyone
could go crazy living here.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.618
Maybe in the Dollhouse.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.458
Escalator for Christmas.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.714
I have a dock

19:35.300 --> 19:38.011
I have a dock

19:44.476 --> 19:45.727
And here's the ocean.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.898
Full of big fish with sharp teeth. Yuck!

21:16.109 --> 21:17.777
Why is this door even locked?

21:27.912 --> 21:28.913
Hey, Audra!

21:28.997 --> 21:30.165
- Reese?
- It's missy.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.084
Surprise!

21:33.168 --> 21:34.294
Surprise!

21:34.711 --> 21:37.088
Fuck you, guys.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.301
Say it again. Surprise!

21:41.426 --> 21:43.070
- I'm going to kill you.
- Happy housewarming.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.345
Thanks.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.365
Dude, Audra, were you really going to

21:46.389 --> 21:48.325
bash my brains out with that rock?

21:48.349 --> 21:50.685
Yeah, and I think you would
have deserved it, too.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.936
Disagree.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.861
Come on, guys. Up you go.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.607
Missy: We're so much fun.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.609
Audra: Yeah, tons. Tons of fun.

21:58.276 --> 22:01.154
And where did you get this thing?

22:01.821 --> 22:03.461
Don't ask.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.574
It's getting hot in there.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.659
It's getting hot in here

22:06.743 --> 22:08.637
So take off all your clothes

22:08.661 --> 22:10.663
I am getting so hot

22:10.747 --> 22:12.957
I wanna take my clothes off

22:13.041 --> 22:15.084
when the rest of your clothes come off,

22:15.168 --> 22:16.294
help me with these bags.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.005
Oh, I think breakfast is shot.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.132
Well, luckily,
I brought the wine in first.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.217
That's my girl.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.219
Yeah, even though
she's a big college grad,

22:24.302 --> 22:26.095
her priorities remain intact.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.766
Actually, you take the bag.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.101
- I'm going to go get the suitcases.
- All right.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.758
I still can't tell if this house
is creepy or quaint.

23:03.841 --> 23:04.884
It's Cape Cod.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.761
Every place is both creepy and quaint.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.304
It's like, part of its charm.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.100
I guess that's why
the pilgrims stayed here.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.104
Yeah, or they ran out of gas.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.831
Or they hit a rock. Maybe both.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.295
Something like that.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.946
- Fuck!
- Oh, my gosh.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.323
- What was that?
- My wine.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.242
Did you just say "gosh"?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.326
Shut up!

23:32.328 --> 23:33.806
We'll handle this.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.224
- Audra: Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's fine.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.959
Okay. I'm gonna go put my bags away
and take a shower.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.020
- Sounds good.
- I'm really glad you guys are here.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.671
- I love you.
- I love you.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.345
Maybe slightly more creepy than quaint.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.471
Slightly.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.557
Especially in this house.

23:54.309 --> 23:55.476
Holy cheeses!

23:55.560 --> 23:57.200
- Let's find big knives.
- Audra: Careful!

23:57.270 --> 23:59.390
- I don't know if I have any band-aids!
- Huge knives.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.443
Audra: Seriously, ladies!

24:27.091 --> 24:30.094
Missy: Oh, Reese. Why do you
get the room with the fireplace?

24:30.261 --> 24:32.430
Reese: Because you get the room
with the creepy closet.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.482
I should've brought a glass of wine.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.275
Then this would've been perfect.

25:02.919 --> 25:03.920
Reese?

25:05.672 --> 25:06.673
Missy?

25:08.466 --> 25:09.467
Hello?

25:14.097 --> 25:15.890
Hey! Get me a glass of wine!

25:54.345 --> 25:55.346
Reese?

25:56.305 --> 25:57.306
Missy?

25:58.891 --> 25:59.892
Hello?

26:03.730 --> 26:04.731
Hello?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.193
Fuck! Ow!

26:09.277 --> 26:10.278
Fuck me!

26:10.737 --> 26:13.281
I just bought a beautiful house,
and now I can't see.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.032
That's not a win-win.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.170
Jesus!

27:10.671 --> 27:12.071
Why do you keep trying to scare me?

27:12.131 --> 27:15.009
Scare you? I came in to see if I could use
the shower after you're done,

27:15.092 --> 27:17.178
and you me asked for a glass of wine.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.597
And you got me a glass of wine?

27:20.556 --> 27:21.599
Yeah.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.977
And I spilled another
glass of wine on my floor.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.312
Yeah.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.398
Thank you.

27:29.899 --> 27:30.900
Missy: Anytime.

27:32.777 --> 27:34.946
It doesn't sound like
you girls are playing nice.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.280
I was playing nice.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.783
Careful! There is glass.

27:39.283 --> 27:40.326
Good grief!

27:40.785 --> 27:42.245
Could you toss me that towel?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.329
Reese: Sure.

27:44.539 --> 27:45.540
Audra: Thank you.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.960
If you are so against drinking wine
tonight, why did you buy so much?

27:49.043 --> 27:51.003
I didn't mean to be,
but it's a good thing I did.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.255
Yeah, I'll say.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.658
I'm going to grab my glass before

27:53.714 --> 27:55.692
shambles strikes again.

27:55.716 --> 27:58.261
Why don't you shower upstairs
and I'll help Audra with this?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.345
Righto.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.649
You're superjumpy tonight.
It's not like you.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.944
Well, in all fairness, you guys did try
to give me a heart attack earlier.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.028
True.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.131
Can you go get me some undennear
out of my room, please?

28:18.155 --> 28:19.198
Sure thing.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.497
Audra: Not the cute ones.

28:33.337 --> 28:36.215
You could never

28:36.716 --> 28:40.052
be killed

28:40.177 --> 28:46.183
the feeling was real

28:46.392 --> 28:49.645
and I touch you

28:49.729 --> 28:53.608
with my hand

28:53.774 --> 28:55.651
touch you...

28:55.818 --> 28:56.861
These will do.

28:58.279 --> 28:59.363
Audra: Thank you.

29:11.626 --> 29:13.669
Missy: What kind of radio station is this?

29:17.506 --> 29:19.050
Ugh. Where's the radio, anyway?

29:36.192 --> 29:37.985
I was a-walkin'

29:39.487 --> 29:42.323
in my new black boots

29:42.907 --> 29:45.493
cause darlin' you know

29:46.410 --> 29:49.205
the best trees show their roots

29:49.288 --> 29:50.831
and when I showed up

29:52.667 --> 29:55.836
to that dance hall on 65

29:55.920 --> 29:57.254
I was a-lookin'...

29:59.048 --> 30:01.676
I wish my parents would
get me a house when I graduated.

30:02.677 --> 30:04.637
Audra: Yeah, my parents bought me
this great place

30:04.679 --> 30:07.682
because they think I'll live here forever
and they'll see me more often.

30:08.808 --> 30:12.061
You know the drill.
Grandbabies, blah, blah, blah

30:12.478 --> 30:13.980
at least that's what my mom thinks.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.357
Basically, exactly like my sister.

30:16.774 --> 30:19.068
- Will it work?
- Not a chance.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.529
I'm going back to the real city
after the summer.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.239
So cool.

30:23.823 --> 30:27.702
But I probably will visit more often
now that this is my own place.

30:27.785 --> 30:30.579
I can't wait till you move to New York
so I can come visit you there.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.082
You should move to New York.

30:33.582 --> 30:34.625
Maybe.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.836
I still can't believe
you got this house.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.672
Why? I've always loved this house.

30:39.797 --> 30:43.134
But it's the tupp house.
The motherfucking tupp house.

30:43.217 --> 30:44.343
Enough of that.

30:44.427 --> 30:45.678
Fuck the tupps.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.054
It's my house now.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.562
No more

30:54.937 --> 30:57.523
turns across the floor

30:57.773 --> 30:59.275
but then it's your turn

30:59.608 --> 31:01.235
boy, you better learn

31:01.318 --> 31:02.611
to be a gentleman

31:04.780 --> 31:06.073
to be a gentleman

31:12.747 --> 31:16.125
Babe, the tupps were mad
and people died here.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.728
And what about the ones that vanished?

31:17.752 --> 31:19.420
Lord knows what happened to them.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.883
So you're saying this place is haunted
just because some crazy family

31:23.966 --> 31:26.218
lived here years ago
and some of them died here?

31:26.886 --> 31:30.222
Uh, yeah, basically, I would say
that's what makes it haunted.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.191
Don't want your religion, no

31:40.274 --> 31:43.110
I got problems of my own

31:43.194 --> 31:47.073
don't want your misgivings, no

31:47.156 --> 31:53.079
you gotta be suave cause you know...

31:53.329 --> 31:54.497
Audra: Whatever.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.124
All the tupps are dead and gone
or othennise vanished.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.375
And it's my place now.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.712
Daddy paid in full cash
well below market value

32:01.796 --> 32:04.673
because, apparently,
people think like you do

32:04.757 --> 32:06.717
and nobody wants it but me

32:06.801 --> 32:10.221
and I'm never, ever selling it.

32:12.515 --> 32:13.766
Well, okay, then.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.977
Because I love it. It's big and pretty.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.980
And I have a beach and a dock
and a boathouse.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.233
That boathouse is a death trap.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.276
Audra: Maybe so.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.363
That's okay because I don't want
or need a boat because

32:27.446 --> 32:29.406
I hate the water.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.325
But you love the beach.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.910
Love the beach, hate the water

32:32.993 --> 32:35.579
'cause I don't like those
fish with big teeth.

32:35.663 --> 32:36.747
You mean sharks?

32:36.831 --> 32:38.833
Those are the ones.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.626
All right.

32:46.841 --> 32:48.425
I'm going to go get more wine.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.386
Are you actually going
to finish it this time?

32:50.469 --> 32:52.388
You know what? I can give it a go.

32:52.805 --> 32:53.973
What about the bathroom?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.307
Leave it.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.642
I'll pick it up later.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.855
- Audra: Come on.
- Reese: Okay, fine.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.656
Grab something
to slice the cheese with, please.

33:13.784 --> 33:14.785
Perfect.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.415
Reese: I have to tell you,
the idea of spending the night

33:19.498 --> 33:21.750
in the tupp house creeps me out.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.627
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

33:23.961 --> 33:26.088
Okay, so I went to the zoo the other day.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.173
Yeah?

33:27.256 --> 33:30.509
And there was only one dog,
and it was a shih tzu.

33:35.264 --> 33:37.016
Oh, my god. That's stupid.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.059
I know. It's cheesy, right?

33:39.268 --> 33:40.769
Audra: Cheesy? Get it?

33:40.853 --> 33:42.521
Get it?

33:43.230 --> 33:45.065
I know, we're comedians.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.410
Reese: Missy! Get down here!
The movie's starting!

33:56.785 --> 33:58.704
All right! Just a minute!

34:00.623 --> 34:03.250
This is all I wanted to do all day.

34:03.918 --> 34:04.919
Amen to that.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.048
Although this movie is probably
going to give me nightmares.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.217
Mmm. It'll be worth it.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.301
If you say so.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.765
Reese:
Get down here! The movie is starting!

34:19.600 --> 34:20.726
Missy: I'm coming!

34:21.310 --> 34:23.020
Not that I want to watch the movie.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.859
I might have to crawl into
bed with you later.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.195
Reese: Missy!

34:31.278 --> 34:32.279
Missy: I'm coming!

34:33.322 --> 34:35.908
Oh, man. This movie again?

34:35.991 --> 34:37.451
I hate scary movies.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.119
Come on, missy, don't be such a pussy.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.622
I'm sorry that I don't like
stupid horror movies

34:41.705 --> 34:45.542
with stupid naked chicks running around,
getting chased by chainsaws or whatever.

34:45.626 --> 34:46.686
Some people love them.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.396
Then I guess that's why
they still make them.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.005
- Audra: Mm-hmm.
- I like them

34:50.089 --> 34:51.882
even though they give me the willies.

34:55.970 --> 34:58.722
Shit. I wish someone was here
to give me the Willy.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.057
But it's a girls' night.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.725
Just pour a glass and sit down.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.770
Way ahead of you, dear.

35:05.271 --> 35:07.147
Try not to spill any on the floor, huh?

35:07.231 --> 35:08.565
That was not my fault.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.192
Always making a mess.

35:10.276 --> 35:11.670
All right, well, I'm going to bed.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.279
Um, big day of drinking tomorrow.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.281
- Boo.
- Boo nothing.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.908
I love you guys and
I'm really glad you're home, Audra.

35:17.992 --> 35:18.993
Love you, babe.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.498
Reese: Don't look in the closet!

35:24.581 --> 35:26.500
Missy: Don't light yourself on fire!

35:26.792 --> 35:27.960
Reese: No promises!

35:28.377 --> 35:29.503
It's chilly in here.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.463
Really has a nice view.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.595
Too bad it's haunted.

36:41.617 --> 36:42.910
Don't look in the closet.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.455
You'll just encourage...

36:46.538 --> 36:48.082
W... whatever.

37:18.112 --> 37:19.279
Don't do it.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.253
Fuck.

37:41.969 --> 37:45.055
Missy: Of course the woods behind
the tupp house are terrifying.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.742
Just close your eyes and
have sweet dreams.

38:47.201 --> 38:48.660
Holy Christ!

38:48.744 --> 38:50.579
Wow.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.123
- Anyone important?
- No.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.296
Are you done with the cheese?

38:59.421 --> 39:00.881
Yeah, I think I've had enough.

39:01.215 --> 39:02.508
I'll take the knife, too.

39:03.383 --> 39:04.801
Carry on.

39:11.433 --> 39:12.809
I think I'll hit it, too.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.312
Babe, really?

39:15.395 --> 39:17.832
I'm beat and I think I've had enough
excitement for one night.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.692
Are you sure?
We're about to get to the good part.

39:20.776 --> 39:23.987
Yeah, if I see any more good parts,
I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight.

39:24.071 --> 39:25.656
Okay. I'll go to bed soon too.

39:25.739 --> 39:26.740
No, you won't.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.367
Night. Sleep tight.

39:28.450 --> 39:31.620
- Don't let the bed bugs...
- Don't say bedbugs.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.747
There better not be any bedbugs in there.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.332
Uh, no bugs.

39:35.916 --> 39:36.917
Good.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.460
The rats ate them.

39:38.919 --> 39:40.712
I'll die. I'll iiterallyjust die.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.214
Good night.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.549
Good night.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.875
Reese: I hope everything is locked.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.409
No rats, no bugs.

40:15.122 --> 40:17.040
At least I don't have to sleep upstairs.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.143
And magic.

40:38.854 --> 40:41.106
It's getting hot in here

40:41.189 --> 40:43.650
so take off all your clothes

41:41.792 --> 41:44.461
Haunted or not,
at least the fire makes it cozy.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.693
Just a normal unhaunted cape house.

45:33.648 --> 45:36.484
Johnny on TV: From behind
the tree, and grandpa got all excited,

45:36.568 --> 45:39.696
and he shook his fist at me and said,
"boy, you'll be damned to hell!"

45:39.779 --> 45:42.240
Remember that? Right over there.

45:43.533 --> 45:45.410
Boy, you used to really be scared here.

45:46.620 --> 45:47.662
Barbra on TV: Johnny!

45:48.121 --> 45:49.623
Johnny: Hey, you're still afraid!

45:49.998 --> 45:51.583
Barbra: Stop it, now! I mean it!

45:56.588 --> 45:58.465
Johnny: I'm coming to get you, Barbra!

45:59.424 --> 46:01.593
Barbra: Stop it! You're ignorant!

46:01.676 --> 46:03.678
Johnny: They're coming for you, Barbra!

46:04.679 --> 46:06.932
Barbra: Stop it!
You're acting like a child!

46:07.223 --> 46:08.463
Johnny: They're coming for you!

46:09.517 --> 46:11.561
Johnny: Look, there comes one of them now!

46:18.276 --> 46:20.612
You, you belong on the ground!

46:21.529 --> 46:23.365
Now stay on the ground!

46:32.165 --> 46:34.000
- Christ! Fuck!
- Hey.

46:35.710 --> 46:38.380
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

46:38.463 --> 46:39.714
Are you sure you're okay?

46:40.090 --> 46:42.092
Audra: Yes, it's just the wind.

46:45.345 --> 46:46.429
Go back to bed.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.141
- Reese: Good night.
- Good night.

46:50.225 --> 46:51.385
Reese: Please lock the doors.

47:15.291 --> 47:16.626
Here's to you, grammy.

47:44.571 --> 47:45.572
Whoo!

47:45.655 --> 47:46.781
That worked fast.

48:18.354 --> 48:19.355
Hello?

49:17.956 --> 49:19.124
Hey, stop that.

49:57.871 --> 49:58.872
Couldn't sleep?

49:59.164 --> 50:02.292
No, your fucking dog woke me up.
It licked my feet.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.419
I don't have a dog.

50:06.212 --> 50:07.255
What do you mean?

50:07.338 --> 50:08.756
I mean, I don't have a dog.

50:08.840 --> 50:11.050
You've been here all night.
Did you see a dog?

50:11.634 --> 50:13.303
I don't know. It's a big house.

50:13.553 --> 50:14.679
That pug thing?

50:15.013 --> 50:16.556
- Wookie?
- Yeah, wookie.

50:16.639 --> 50:17.932
That's my dad's dog.

50:18.016 --> 50:20.810
He's sort of cute
but I wouldn't let him in here.

50:20.894 --> 50:22.145
Think of the carpets.

50:22.562 --> 50:23.813
Are you fucking with me?

50:25.023 --> 50:26.274
No, I'm not.

50:27.609 --> 50:29.903
Audra, if you don't have a dog...

50:30.904 --> 50:32.780
Then something licked my feet.

50:37.702 --> 50:38.703
Let's go.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.260
See? No dog.

50:54.761 --> 50:58.014
Contrary to what you may think,
that doesn't make me feel any better.

51:06.105 --> 51:07.106
Audra.

51:19.911 --> 51:21.454
Reese: I really don't like this.

51:29.087 --> 51:30.880
Reese: These knives are sharp, right?

51:48.398 --> 51:49.732
No dog over here.

51:51.818 --> 51:53.695
Something licked my feet.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.613
And no dog over here.

51:56.281 --> 51:59.325
I repeat. Something licked my feet.

52:00.285 --> 52:02.996
Hmm. Maybe...

52:03.162 --> 52:06.582
It was a big, scary...

52:06.666 --> 52:08.710
Do not say rat.

52:10.044 --> 52:12.630
- Get down.
- Isn't there a song about monkeys

52:12.714 --> 52:14.632
jumping on the bed with butcher knives?

52:14.716 --> 52:16.509
You had a strange childhood.

52:16.592 --> 52:17.593
Come on.

52:21.848 --> 52:23.349
Three little monkeys

52:23.433 --> 52:24.809
jumping on the bed

52:24.892 --> 52:25.935
not with knives.

52:27.562 --> 52:29.397
What's wrong? What are you guys doing?

52:29.480 --> 52:30.773
She was jumping on the bed.

52:30.857 --> 52:33.609
And she thinks a dog
was licking her feet in her sleep.

52:33.693 --> 52:34.986
And there's no dog.

52:35.903 --> 52:37.697
Okay, well, thanks for stopping by.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.242
Let's go.

52:41.326 --> 52:42.535
Can't we search her room?

52:42.618 --> 52:44.746
Audra: No. Let the poor girl sleep.
Come on.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.122
Fine.

52:52.795 --> 52:54.672
Not that I'm getting much sleep.

53:28.122 --> 53:29.582
Something did lick my feet.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.918
Maybe it was just a bad dream.

53:32.001 --> 53:34.837
Or maybe it was a good dream, huh?
How long was the tongue?

53:35.338 --> 53:36.547
I'm calling the cops.

53:36.631 --> 53:38.174
Really?

53:38.257 --> 53:39.360
What are you gonna tell them?

53:39.384 --> 53:41.677
I don't have a dog.
They're gonna laugh at you.

53:41.928 --> 53:44.222
As long as they bring guns,
they can laugh.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.140
I'm gonna laugh at you.

53:51.145 --> 53:52.230
Reese: It's not here!

53:53.022 --> 53:54.482
What's not there?

53:54.816 --> 53:56.234
The imaginary dog?

53:56.317 --> 53:58.444
Why don't you Google "imaginary"?

53:58.528 --> 54:00.196
Hell, why don't you Google "dog"?

54:00.279 --> 54:01.906
Reese: No, my phone.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.116
My phone is gone.

54:03.199 --> 54:04.784
Your phone is not gone.

54:04.867 --> 54:07.412
- It's nowhere.
- Your phone is not nowhere.

54:07.495 --> 54:09.163
- Call it.
- Is that a dare?

54:09.247 --> 54:10.248
Just call it.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.708
Audra: Okay. I'll call it.
But when we find it,

54:12.792 --> 54:15.336
you have to promise me
you'll Google "imaginary dog".

54:15.545 --> 54:16.546
Deal.

54:23.469 --> 54:24.804
Man on TV: Do you live here?

54:39.986 --> 54:40.987
Funny.

54:41.070 --> 54:42.113
Reese: What?

54:45.283 --> 54:48.119
Audra: I could've sworn
I put my phone in my purse.

54:50.371 --> 54:51.414
See?

54:51.539 --> 54:53.583
See what? I'll find it.

54:53.666 --> 54:54.834
They took our phones.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.628
Audra: Like, took them how?
Who? When? Where? Why?

54:57.712 --> 54:59.964
I don't know. Maybe upstairs or before.

55:00.465 --> 55:03.134
Even dogs don't take phones, Reese.

55:03.301 --> 55:05.636
You're right, Audra.
Dogs don't take phones.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.896
Reese: I really don't like this place.

55:14.979 --> 55:16.814
Audra: What the fuck?

55:17.398 --> 55:18.524
Reese: Oh, my god!

55:18.983 --> 55:21.611
Any chance you do have a dog
that you forgot about?

55:22.904 --> 55:25.573
I mean, I hope so,
but those aren't paw prints.

55:25.656 --> 55:26.699
Reese: What are they?

55:28.159 --> 55:29.243
Hoof prints?

55:29.327 --> 55:30.578
Like the devil?

55:30.661 --> 55:33.706
The devil's got to have better things
to do than this. I mean...

55:34.081 --> 55:35.291
Wars and shit.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.103
Reese: I don't know.
I mean, if they're not paw prints

55:38.127 --> 55:39.962
or devil hoof prints, what are they?

55:46.552 --> 55:48.763
There's only one good
goddamn way to find out.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.014
I knew you'd say that.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.318
Reese: Ouch!

56:09.617 --> 56:11.827
Reese: Goats? You have goats?

56:12.203 --> 56:14.580
No. Obviously someone's fucking with us.

56:14.830 --> 56:16.499
Goat fuckers.

56:16.582 --> 56:18.167
He's kind of cute, though, right?

56:19.460 --> 56:21.921
Yeah, right. Why don't you
have him lick your feet?

56:22.004 --> 56:23.756
Reese: Help me up.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.883
Up we go.

56:28.052 --> 56:29.887
So much for my cute undennear.

56:31.430 --> 56:32.515
Reese: Stupid goat.

57:09.176 --> 57:10.177
Audra!

57:12.096 --> 57:15.016
- Reese: I'm not going near that goat.
- Audra: Just open the door for it.

57:15.057 --> 57:16.183
He already licked your feet.

57:16.267 --> 57:17.327
Reese: You're the one with a knife.

57:17.351 --> 57:20.271
So you want me to kill the goat?

57:29.572 --> 57:31.657
Audra: Shit! Ow!

57:32.116 --> 57:34.243
Reese: Help me! Help me up!
Don't leave me!

57:34.327 --> 57:35.911
Audra: Reese! Reese! Reese!

57:35.995 --> 57:37.955
Come on! Come on! Oh, my god!

57:50.801 --> 57:51.862
Reese: Audra!

57:51.886 --> 57:54.096
Oh, my god. What are we gonna do? Careful!

57:55.264 --> 57:56.724
Reese!

57:56.807 --> 57:58.267
But we have to just run.

57:58.601 --> 58:00.144
Missy! What about missy?

58:00.436 --> 58:02.938
- We can't leave her.
- What the fuck are we gonna do?

58:03.272 --> 58:05.816
- My keys! My keys are in my purse.
- You can't go in there.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.109
Hold on.

58:09.195 --> 58:10.446
- Audra: Missy!
- Reese: Missy!

58:12.490 --> 58:13.783
Missy!

58:19.622 --> 58:21.040
She can't still be sleeping.

58:21.123 --> 58:22.750
Maybe... maybe she's hiding.

58:29.465 --> 58:31.801
- Oh, is that him?
- Reese: I think so. Who else?

58:31.884 --> 58:33.886
I don't know.
There could be more than one.

58:36.514 --> 58:37.682
Missy: Help me!

58:41.310 --> 58:42.937
- I'm going in.
- No!

58:43.437 --> 58:45.856
- Yes, I'm going in to get missy.
- Don't leave me.

58:45.940 --> 58:48.025
I'm gonna in and get missy and our keys.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.237
- Reese: Please don't leave me.
- Listen.

58:51.362 --> 58:53.614
- Count to 180.
- What?

58:54.115 --> 58:55.324
Three minutes. I'll be fast.

58:55.408 --> 58:58.327
If I'm not back by the time
you get done counting, then run.

58:58.411 --> 59:02.081
Run down the middle of the street and
don't stop for anyone or anything, okay?

59:02.957 --> 59:04.125
Please don't go.

59:05.376 --> 59:06.460
I have to go.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.586
He's gone now.

59:12.758 --> 59:13.884
Please don't go.

59:14.385 --> 59:15.386
Audra!

59:19.682 --> 59:20.683
You can do this.

59:23.060 --> 59:25.104
Reese: Please be fast.

59:28.482 --> 59:30.443
Audra: Missy!

59:43.748 --> 59:45.082
101.

59:46.208 --> 59:47.293
Come on, Audra!

59:47.960 --> 59:49.754
Audra: Missy? Missy!

59:51.505 --> 59:52.965
Missy! Wake up!

59:53.048 --> 59:55.885
Missy! Wake up! Missy!

59:55.968 --> 59:57.011
Come on. We gotta go.

59:57.261 --> 59:58.262
Missy.

1:00:22.161 --> 1:00:23.245
Missy!

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:27.875
199, 200.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:30.503
Oh, my god!

1:00:30.836 --> 1:00:32.004
201.

1:00:32.213 --> 1:00:33.631
200 and... fuck!

1:00:36.258 --> 1:00:38.719
Oh, my god!

1:01:14.255 --> 1:01:15.714
Fuck! Fuck me!

1:01:20.010 --> 1:01:21.220
What's going on?

1:01:21.679 --> 1:01:22.930
Why are there goats?

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:25.015
Shoo! Go away, goat!

1:01:26.058 --> 1:01:27.518
Oh, my god.

1:01:30.312 --> 1:01:31.647
Reese: Oh.

1:01:37.820 --> 1:01:38.821
Shit!

1:01:40.990 --> 1:01:42.366
Why is my phone in here?

1:02:29.288 --> 1:02:30.789
Reese: No!

1:02:33.667 --> 1:02:34.668
Please!

1:08:49.710 --> 1:08:51.086
Who are you?

1:08:53.547 --> 1:08:54.715
Audra: Who are you?

1:08:56.967 --> 1:08:59.136
Who the fuck are you?

1:09:02.973 --> 1:09:03.974
You know what?

1:09:04.891 --> 1:09:06.184
I don't care!

1:10:37.692 --> 1:10:40.028
Woman: I can't believe this happened.
Any of it.

1:10:41.196 --> 1:10:43.281
Can you believe the fucking nerve of him?

1:10:43.448 --> 1:10:45.033
I really can't.

1:10:45.575 --> 1:10:48.495
I know. It takes a special
kind of asshole to ask for a divorce

1:10:48.578 --> 1:10:51.456
at the hospital where
your dad just fucking died.

1:10:51.540 --> 1:10:55.460
He really asked for the divorce
right after your dad, you know...

1:10:55.544 --> 1:10:57.544
I mean, honestly, it was
after they pulled the plug

1:10:57.587 --> 1:10:59.714
so technically dead,
but he wasn't even cold.

1:11:00.257 --> 1:11:01.675
Spoken to Audra yet?

1:11:02.050 --> 1:11:03.051
No.

1:11:03.718 --> 1:11:05.530
I don't even think she knows yet.
I've been trying to get

1:11:05.554 --> 1:11:07.490
- a hold of her all night.
- Did Brett give you any...

1:11:07.514 --> 1:11:09.391
I don't know, indication?

1:11:09.474 --> 1:11:12.853
Uh, oh, you mean besides
the fucking tramps he's been nailing

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:15.522
- at the golf course?
- What a piece of shit.

1:11:15.605 --> 1:11:18.024
Yeah. Can you at least
keep him from your money?

1:11:18.108 --> 1:11:20.318
No. We don't have a prenup and...

1:11:20.485 --> 1:11:23.947
Daddy's worth a fortune.
He probably thinks he's just going to...

1:11:24.197 --> 1:11:26.241
He's going to cash in on half.

1:11:26.324 --> 1:11:27.993
That fucking bastard!

1:11:28.076 --> 1:11:29.786
I've never liked him.

1:11:30.954 --> 1:11:32.080
Oh, my god.

1:11:33.206 --> 1:11:36.585
God bless daddy's soul.
I mean, he spent all of his money

1:11:36.668 --> 1:11:38.628
on tramps at the golf course.

1:11:39.004 --> 1:11:41.756
Over my dead body will I watch it
get spent that way again.

1:11:41.882 --> 1:11:43.734
You're really going over
to the tupp house? Now?

1:11:43.758 --> 1:11:45.135
Yeah, I'm here. I gotta go.

1:11:45.427 --> 1:11:46.803
Be strong, Haley.

1:11:54.478 --> 1:11:56.813
I should literally kill him.

1:11:56.897 --> 1:11:59.691
I should chop him up into 406 pieces,

1:11:59.774 --> 1:12:03.069
box him, bow him and bestow him
to his fucking mother.

1:12:07.824 --> 1:12:09.534
Just breathe, Haley. Just breathe.

1:12:10.827 --> 1:12:13.246
Do not fall apart at the seams. Not now.

1:12:14.039 --> 1:12:15.040
Fuck!

1:12:32.974 --> 1:12:34.476
Holy fuck! Pick up!

1:12:38.939 --> 1:12:40.190
What the fuck?

1:12:49.407 --> 1:12:50.408
Audra?

1:12:50.784 --> 1:12:52.160
Audra: Hey, this is Audra.

1:12:52.244 --> 1:12:56.456
I don't check messages regularly,
but leave a message. Bye.

1:13:34.744 --> 1:13:35.829
Oh, my god!

1:13:39.416 --> 1:13:40.834
Audra: Hey, this is Audra.

1:13:40.917 --> 1:13:45.046
I don't check messages regularly,
but leave a message. Bye.

1:14:22.751 --> 1:14:23.752
Fuck!

1:14:34.763 --> 1:14:35.764
Audra?

1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:09.566
Haley: Fuck you!

1:16:40.513 --> 1:16:42.390
- Brett?
- You bitch!

1:16:47.771 --> 1:16:49.397
Brett: I killed your dad, bitch.

1:16:52.233 --> 1:16:54.486
Brett: Die!

1:16:57.238 --> 1:16:59.365
Die! Die! Just fucking die!

1:17:12.253 --> 1:17:13.421
Just die.

1:17:28.812 --> 1:17:29.813
Audra?

1:17:31.105 --> 1:17:32.190
Haley?

1:17:37.445 --> 1:17:39.030
Is this your piece of shit husband?

1:17:39.113 --> 1:17:40.365
Yes, it is.

1:17:43.701 --> 1:17:44.744
I never liked him.

1:17:45.203 --> 1:17:46.371
Well, I did.

1:17:47.205 --> 1:17:48.706
You're not wearing your wedding ring.

1:17:49.165 --> 1:17:51.835
Yeah, well, he killed daddy.

1:17:57.632 --> 1:17:59.717
Okay. Okay!

1:18:00.510 --> 1:18:02.262
Hey, he's going to fucking die!

1:18:02.637 --> 1:18:05.014
Audra, he's going to fucking die.

1:18:05.974 --> 1:18:06.975
Yeah.

1:18:07.058 --> 1:18:08.893
Yeah, so, let him bleed out in peace.

1:18:10.228 --> 1:18:12.897
He killed daddy and you want him
to bleed out in peace?

1:18:12.981 --> 1:18:13.982
Really?

1:18:15.692 --> 1:18:17.235
How about bleed out in pieces?

1:18:17.569 --> 1:18:19.821
Yeah! Bleed out in pieces, asshole!

1:18:22.866 --> 1:18:24.242
You bitch!

1:18:53.479 --> 1:18:56.107
Haley.

1:18:57.609 --> 1:18:59.944
Haley.

1:19:03.615 --> 1:19:06.701
Haley.

1:19:47.867 --> 1:19:49.202
Audra: You're such a bitch.

1:19:58.962 --> 1:20:02.548
Haley is not going to be
a happy camper when she wakes up.

1:20:09.889 --> 1:20:12.266
Nope. She'll be super pissed.

1:20:34.789 --> 1:20:37.250
- We lost all the goats.
- Not all the goats.

1:20:37.333 --> 1:20:40.628
- The cute one.
- Cute? They're super scary.

1:20:41.045 --> 1:20:43.423
Are you kidding me?
They look like evil devil monkeys

1:20:43.506 --> 1:20:46.092
with these black dead eyes.

1:20:46.175 --> 1:20:48.015
I think they're pretty cute.

1:20:49.053 --> 1:20:51.556
I bet Audra was so freaked out.

1:20:51.639 --> 1:20:53.099
You think about your ex a lot.

1:20:53.391 --> 1:20:56.936
I just wish I could've seen the look
on her face whenever she saw the goat.

1:20:57.353 --> 1:20:59.397
Yeah. Yeah, we got her pretty good.

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:01.315
- Yeah.
- Let's go find the cute goat.

1:21:01.399 --> 1:21:03.151
Hey, devil monkeys.

1:21:03.234 --> 1:21:04.277
Hey, hey.

1:21:09.073 --> 1:21:10.450
Autumn: The sun is almost up.

1:21:11.576 --> 1:21:13.536
I hope we find him soon.

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:34.390
Devon: There he is.

1:21:39.103 --> 1:21:40.438
Shit!

1:21:43.357 --> 1:21:45.401
- He's gone.
- He was the cute one.

1:21:46.194 --> 1:21:47.695
Autumn: We'll never get him now.

1:21:49.072 --> 1:21:50.073
Devon: I'm sorry.

1:21:53.117 --> 1:21:54.285
But I do know

1:21:54.368 --> 1:21:56.204
- how to make you feel better.
- What?

1:21:56.287 --> 1:21:58.456
- A quick skinny dip.
- Nice try.

1:21:58.581 --> 1:22:00.583
I think I've been
naked enough for one day.

1:22:00.666 --> 1:22:02.210
Technically, it's a new day.

1:22:03.294 --> 1:22:04.462
Catch me if you can!

1:22:08.841 --> 1:22:11.219
Whoa, are you trying
to attack me?

1:22:12.887 --> 1:22:14.722
- Babe.
- Yeah, babe?

1:22:15.139 --> 1:22:16.140
Look.

1:22:22.522 --> 1:22:24.690
Is that... blood?

1:22:30.321 --> 1:22:31.697
Babe, don't.

1:22:31.864 --> 1:22:34.117
Devon: I just want to take a look.

1:22:39.247 --> 1:22:40.248
Stay right here.

1:22:40.331 --> 1:22:41.457
- Stay right here.
- Okay.

1:22:48.422 --> 1:22:50.007
- What the fuck?
- Come on. Come on.

1:23:14.782 --> 1:23:16.242
- Devon!
- Oh, fuck!

1:23:16.325 --> 1:23:17.326
Who was that?

1:23:17.827 --> 1:23:19.203
I don't know.

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:20.621
What do we do?

1:23:20.913 --> 1:23:22.165
I don't know.

1:23:22.790 --> 1:23:25.042
- We gotta find Audra. What?
- Enough about your ex!

1:23:25.585 --> 1:23:27.670
Shit!

1:23:31.632 --> 1:23:32.675
Devon!

1:23:42.059 --> 1:23:44.979
Rest in pieces, asshole!

1:23:48.065 --> 1:23:49.483
Autumn: Oh, my god!

1:23:51.152 --> 1:23:52.153
Fuck!

1:23:54.530 --> 1:23:56.282
He was trying to help you!

1:23:56.365 --> 1:23:57.909
Do I look like I need help?

1:24:14.133 --> 1:24:15.384
Autumn: Oh, my god!

1:24:33.361 --> 1:24:34.779
Autumn: Please!

1:24:47.458 --> 1:24:50.836
Ghost in my fucking house?
Are you kidding me?

1:24:56.676 --> 1:24:58.135
Devon was a real dick.

1:24:58.511 --> 1:25:00.596
Autumn: He tried to help you.

1:25:34.338 --> 1:25:35.589
Audra: Stupid birds.

1:25:40.970 --> 1:25:42.888
What are they so goddamn cheery about?

1:26:15.338 --> 1:26:16.339
Reese?

1:26:28.684 --> 1:26:29.727
It's okay.

1:26:31.270 --> 1:26:32.271
I'm here.

1:26:37.318 --> 1:26:38.652
I'm so sorry.

1:26:43.157 --> 1:26:45.326
This way is better, okay?

1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:48.329
It won't hurt anymore.

1:26:51.374 --> 1:26:52.375
I love you.

1:26:54.001 --> 1:26:55.211
I'm so sorry.

1:26:56.545 --> 1:26:58.506
This is better.

1:26:59.590 --> 1:27:00.716
This is better.

1:27:02.468 --> 1:27:03.636
I'm so sorry.

1:28:39.773 --> 1:28:40.858
Audra: In pieces.

1:28:40.941 --> 1:28:42.252
Okay. Audra, stop!

1:28:42.276 --> 1:28:43.861
Seriously. Stop! He's gonna die!

1:28:43.944 --> 1:28:45.571
Just leave it be.

1:28:45.988 --> 1:28:48.574
- Die in pieces, asshole!
- You bitch!

1:28:50.117 --> 1:28:53.204
Crew member: That's too much.
Sit up, unnaturally.

1:28:53.287 --> 1:28:55.289
- Unnaturally? Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:28:59.376 --> 1:29:00.669
Woman: Sorry if I hurt you.

1:29:00.753 --> 1:29:04.340
I could've sworn...
I put my purse in my bag.

1:29:06.884 --> 1:29:09.220
I could've sworn I put my bag in my purse.

1:29:09.303 --> 1:29:10.679
What?

1:29:23.901 --> 1:29:25.694
I'm calling...

1:29:25.778 --> 1:29:27.571
I'm calling...

1:29:28.239 --> 1:29:29.490
We're going to start over.

1:29:42.002 --> 1:29:43.003
Crew member: Come on.

1:29:43.087 --> 1:29:44.814
I don't know what's going on.

1:29:44.838 --> 1:29:46.173
- Then be like...
- Okay.

1:29:46.382 --> 1:29:48.050
- Gotcha.
- Motherlode.

1:29:48.133 --> 1:29:50.719
Just be, like, looking for the cheese.

1:29:56.433 --> 1:29:58.852
Get in there.

1:29:59.812 --> 1:30:00.896
This is the other hand.

1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:03.041
- So, while I'm...
- You're good. When you bring it up,

1:30:03.065 --> 1:30:05.001
- bring it up so we see you bring it up.
- Just bring it right here.

1:30:05.025 --> 1:30:06.503
Crew: So we know that
it's like, a ring, and not your

1:30:06.527 --> 1:30:08.612
cock or something.

1:30:08.696 --> 1:30:11.907
- I told her what I was going to...
- I hate you.

1:30:16.996 --> 1:30:19.623
Okay, you guys. Sorry,
this thing is not staying.

1:30:20.791 --> 1:30:22.626
It's not staying in my ass, I guess...

1:30:22.710 --> 1:30:23.711
Okay, there.

1:30:24.712 --> 1:30:26.839
- I heard that.
- All right.

1:30:28.299 --> 1:30:29.466
That's disgusting.

1:30:30.050 --> 1:30:31.468
Look...

1:30:31.552 --> 1:30:34.555
Look, I have to use
two hands to cover one tit.

1:30:37.391 --> 1:30:38.601
One can't cover it.

1:30:38.684 --> 1:30:40.811
That's accurate. This is accurate.

1:30:40.894 --> 1:30:42.730
Like her head.

1:30:42.813 --> 1:30:44.440
It's the size of my...

1:30:44.523 --> 1:30:46.317
It's true.

1:30:47.067 --> 1:30:48.068
Jesus!

1:30:48.694 --> 1:30:50.297
- Crew: Let's do it...
- All right.

1:30:50.321 --> 1:30:51.405
Yeah.

1:30:55.701 --> 1:30:57.953
Jesus! Why do you keep
trying to scare me?

1:30:58.037 --> 1:31:00.164
Scare you? I came into your... sorry.

1:31:00.664 --> 1:31:02.499
- Can we reset?
- Crew: Reset!

1:31:17.598 --> 1:31:20.225
Oh, my god.

1:31:27.399 --> 1:31:29.026
Sorry, guys.

1:31:29.109 --> 1:31:30.778
It's my first time driving a lambo.

1:31:32.738 --> 1:31:34.657
Crew: I know, I know.

1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:35.741
- Yes.
- Really? No.

1:31:35.824 --> 1:31:38.035
- It's my first time.
- Surprise.

1:31:40.037 --> 1:31:42.790
- Let's make a movie!
- And... 7, 8, 9, 12.

1:31:43.999 --> 1:31:45.000
Reese: Yo mama!

1:32:12.611 --> 1:32:15.197
Shame shame shame

1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:18.492

1:32:30.087 --> 1:32:32.214

1:32:32.297 --> 1:32:34.341
when the love is right

1:32:35.759 --> 1:32:39.555

1:34:22.074 --> 1:34:26.328
Are we late for our revival

1:34:27.079 --> 1:34:30.707
as we watch the casket close

1:34:31.917 --> 1:34:37.005
have we gone to our redemption

1:34:37.548 --> 1:34:42.469
as the body leaves the soul

1:34:45.013 --> 1:34:47.933
