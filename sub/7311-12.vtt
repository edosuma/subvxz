WEBVTT

00:17.290 --> 00:18.740
Cut.

00:19.350 --> 00:21.166
What?

00:21.190 --> 00:23.366
- Rhiannon.
- What was wrong with that?

00:23.390 --> 00:25.116
I'm gonna need a real scream.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.576
Thatwasa scream.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.596
No, no, no, no. An ber-scream, okay?

00:28.620 --> 00:33.020
Think ofHalloween II on steroids, okay?

00:34.330 --> 00:37.300
- You want to take a break?
- Yeah.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.366
- Should have gone with the blonde.
- No. You know, this is a favor.

00:41.390 --> 00:43.306
He should be happy I'm even here.

00:43.330 --> 00:45.220
I-I've screamed in threerealmovies.

00:45.250 --> 00:48.590
I mean, if there's one
thing I can do, it's...

00:49.760 --> 00:51.780
Lame.

00:52.300 --> 00:55.850
See, nowthatwas a real scream.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.590
- Rhiannon?
- Help. Help.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.300
Help! Help! Gary, get me out of here.

01:30.950 --> 01:35.940
NCIS Season06 Episode12 Caged.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.446
She was not smiling at you, Tony.

01:39.470 --> 01:41.880
Ziva, some men can hit
a baseball 400 feet,

01:41.910 --> 01:45.106
others build rocket ships
that sail to the stars.

01:45.130 --> 01:48.046
I can spot a woman's smile at 20 yards.

01:48.070 --> 01:51.466
Her name is Hannah, and she's
asked me out to lunch twice.

01:51.490 --> 01:52.896
You?

01:52.920 --> 01:55.056
Did your rocket ship
just take a nose dive?

01:55.080 --> 01:58.080
No. It just landed
on a different planet.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.046
Look, two days ago, you told me my car would
be ready yesterday, and the bill was $270.

02:03.070 --> 02:07.216
Then yesterday, you told me my car
would ready today, and the bill was $400.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.196
Now you're telling me my
car's gonna be ready tomorrow?

02:09.220 --> 02:11.336
- Absolutely. Tomorrow.
- How much?

02:11.360 --> 02:13.990
- One octave or two?
- Two.

02:14.650 --> 02:17.160
$600?

02:18.090 --> 02:20.676
- Okay, I understand, but...
- It's got to be replaced.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.796
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.

02:21.820 --> 02:24.260
Okay then. Thank you.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.636
My crankshaft is wearing out.

02:27.660 --> 02:31.346
There is no question what's going
on involves you and a shaft, McSofty.

02:31.370 --> 02:34.336
Well, Tony, sometimes it's not always
the best policy to be too tough.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.206
It can end up costing
you more in the long run.

02:36.230 --> 02:39.666
I'm guessing that you got more than
your fair share of wedgies as a kid.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.130
I can be tough when I have to be.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.706
- What?
- Nothing.

02:47.730 --> 02:50.456
I mean, you do have your... strengths.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.256
And weaknesses.

02:51.280 --> 02:55.626
But, rember that people can be loved as much for
their weaknesses as they are for their strengths.

02:55.650 --> 02:59.296
Well, then, DiNozzo, you must
be one very well-loved man.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.676
Thank you for noticing, boss.

03:00.700 --> 03:04.530
Squid. Long dead. Let's go.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.330
Hey, Ziva?

03:11.460 --> 03:13.660
Did you accept?

03:14.150 --> 03:16.056
Lunch? Hannah?

03:16.080 --> 03:18.490
Coming through.

03:18.920 --> 03:21.140
Take it easy, McCranky.

03:23.260 --> 03:25.276
You never cease to amaze me, Jethro.

03:25.300 --> 03:30.250
You find the most dastardly crimes
in the most idyllic of settings.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.370
Lieutenant Neal Poletto.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.916
Poletto?

03:36.940 --> 03:38.666
- Get anything?
- Yeah.

03:38.690 --> 03:41.996
An offer to be tech
advisor on his next film.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.906
It's about a psycho, sex-crazed cop.

03:43.930 --> 03:46.576
Life and times of Special
Agent Anthony DiNozzo?

03:46.600 --> 03:49.216
Cuts all around the upper torso.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.246
He's been stabbed multiple times.

03:51.270 --> 03:55.220
And he's missing a middle finger.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.950
It appears to have been sawn off.

04:00.350 --> 04:03.190
The other hand, too, Duck.

04:08.350 --> 04:11.526
Anything else you'd care to
tell me about this fellow, Jethro?

04:11.550 --> 04:13.466
Dead 11 years.

04:13.490 --> 04:16.390
- And?
- And I know who did it.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.266
- Celia Roberts.
- A looker.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.976
No, a hooker.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.716
Convicted of killing two sailors.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.370
By our very own Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.726
Before our time.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.430
Both men had multiple stab wounds.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.596
Both men had their
middle fingers cut off.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.616
Why the middle finger?

04:31.640 --> 04:34.246
Maybe she was giving them the finger.

04:34.270 --> 04:36.540
- Man-hater.
- You would know, Ziva.

04:36.970 --> 04:40.676
She was suspected in the disappearance
and murder of Lieutenant Neal Poletto.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.956
But since his body was never found, she was
only prosecuted for the other two murders.

04:44.980 --> 04:49.456
She was sentenced to 175 years in
the Maryland State Prison for Women.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.256
I hear the first hundred
years are the hardest.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.736
Well, Abby has confirmed that the
knife that killed Lieutenant Poletto

04:53.760 --> 04:57.010
is the same one that Celia Roberts
used on her first two victims.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.886
Open and shut.

04:58.910 --> 05:03.200
Well, DiNozzo, it'd be easier for
everyone if we just get her to admit it.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.536
- I will get a confession.
- Why you?

05:07.560 --> 05:08.866
Because I am a woman.

05:08.890 --> 05:10.396
And women open up to other women.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.686
You mean, likeHannah...
and Her Sisters. Come on.

05:13.710 --> 05:19.016
After 11 years in the joint, all ladies,
she might welcome a little change of pace.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.056
You mean a man.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.276
A virile man could be just
the thing to loosen her lips.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.776
- Oh, you mean Gibbs.
- I mean me.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.956
Not that you're not virile.
You are, 'cause you're the boss.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.530
Who's the boss?

05:30.560 --> 05:33.100
You don't... Those...
Those don't go in there.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.476
McGee. Get her signed confession.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.396
First thing tomorrow morning.
Don't come back without it.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.280
You got it, boss.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.146
What?

05:52.170 --> 05:55.040
It's just, you got to have the
stuff, be tough, know when to bluff.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.310
So, I have to be a really bad poet?

05:57.340 --> 05:59.086
I call my style tough-bluff.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.886
- It's hyphenated.
- Really?

06:00.910 --> 06:04.540
Blowhard actually seems more
appropriate. That is not hyphenated.

06:08.030 --> 06:11.450
You're going to convince a
woman to confess to a crime?

06:12.180 --> 06:13.056
Yeah. So?

06:13.080 --> 06:16.760
When's the last time you convinced
a woman to do anything, McGee?

06:18.720 --> 06:21.906
Just last week, McGee convinced
me to lend him ten dollars.

06:21.930 --> 06:23.916
Ten dollars. Murder one.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.886
My last ten dollars.

06:25.910 --> 06:28.236
When you asked me, I
was determined to say no.

06:28.260 --> 06:30.336
But there was something
in the way you asked.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.476
- Before I knew it, I was opening up my wallet.
- Really?

06:33.500 --> 06:36.630
There's no doubt in my mind you
will get that confession, McGee.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.440
Thank you, Ziva.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.296
He's toast, isn't he?

06:45.320 --> 06:48.970
Oh, yes. Burnt toast.

06:52.460 --> 06:56.066
The following inmates are
to report to Facility B...

06:56.090 --> 06:58.440
Deborah Hoffman, Leslie Chadwick.

06:58.470 --> 07:03.986
Jessica Boswell... Kim Baker, Tiffany...

07:04.010 --> 07:07.400
Report to Facility B
medical line immediately.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.420
This way, sir.

07:21.930 --> 07:22.926
Morning.

07:22.950 --> 07:26.926
I put Celia Roberts in our Attorney Room
in back to give you guys some more privacy.

07:26.950 --> 07:29.170
- Great. Thanks.
- Through here.

07:30.020 --> 07:32.170
Tim?

07:33.980 --> 07:36.920
- Brenda Carter.
- Yeah.

07:40.260 --> 07:44.536
I have not seen you since, oh,
what, graduation night at FLETC?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.606
Yeah. I remember it well.

07:46.630 --> 07:49.996
Oh, those were your shoes that I...

07:50.020 --> 07:51.666
Italian shoes.

07:51.690 --> 07:55.010
- Jamaican rum.
- Empty stomach.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.006
So, I see you left the federal system.

07:58.030 --> 08:00.626
Yeah. You know, better
pay, closer to home, so...

08:00.650 --> 08:04.536
Well, uh, official visit for me.
I'm here to see Celia Roberts.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.326
Oh, well, good luck with that.

08:06.350 --> 08:07.906
Celia's a real piece of work.

08:07.930 --> 08:09.536
Most of 'em are.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.376
So, um, where are you stationed?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.946
Navy Yard.

08:13.970 --> 08:17.710
Well, I'm here. Obviously.

08:22.870 --> 08:27.996
Well, we should, uh, you know, get together
and catch up, have a drink sometime.

08:28.020 --> 08:30.516
Sounds great. Sounds great. Will
you call me? Or I'll call you.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.559
You know, whatever
works, right? So, okay?

08:34.270 --> 08:36.306
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.155
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.049
Okay.

08:40.860 --> 08:42.900
Bye.

09:05.870 --> 09:10.630
Vicari, you flash your boyfriend one
more time, you lose visiting privileges.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.216
Hello.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.710
I'm Special Agent Timothy
McGee. Thank you for seeing me.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.280
Have a choice?

09:43.880 --> 09:46.396
Two photos. Same guy.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.576
Lieutenant Neal Poletto.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.110
He looks better in this one.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.056
Before and after shots.

09:54.080 --> 10:00.010
This one is after he was stabbed 23 times
and had both his middle fingers cut off.

10:00.370 --> 10:03.356
Looks like he's aged a bit, too.

10:03.380 --> 10:05.350
About 11 years.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.676
Guess that's why you're here.

10:07.700 --> 10:11.646
You killed two other men the
same way with the same weapon.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.356
Yours.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.280
It would be nice for the Poletto
family to have some closure.

10:17.410 --> 10:20.476
Stop looking at him! Why
don't you shut up, Vicari?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.856
- Settle down now.
- You want to go?

10:21.880 --> 10:25.360
Now! Get in! I'm not
gonna tell you again...

10:26.070 --> 10:28.380
You were convicted in Maryland.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.226
Poletto's body was found in Virginia.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.910
You know why that's bad for you?

10:33.340 --> 10:35.506
Death penalty.

10:35.530 --> 10:38.630
Virginia is very big on it.

10:40.100 --> 10:43.326
Confess, and this stays a federal case,

10:43.350 --> 10:46.600
meaning no conviction until after
you've served your current sentence.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.186
Meaning never.

10:48.210 --> 10:52.536
Otherwise, I hand this to
the authorities in Virginia.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.596
Way back. Way back...

10:55.620 --> 10:58.356
I don't like needles.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.740
Your choice.

11:02.210 --> 11:05.050
I don't believe you.

11:11.210 --> 11:14.590
- What is that?
- Damn.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.450
Everything okay out there?

11:23.080 --> 11:24.700
Come on.

11:35.930 --> 11:37.486
McGee is out, Abby.

11:37.510 --> 11:39.696
Oh, yeah, I know. He's
slumming at the prison.

11:39.720 --> 11:40.906
We were supposed to have lunch.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.030
I'm just returning his computer game.

11:43.060 --> 11:47.236
Uh, frankly, I do not understand the
fascination with, uh, electronic games.

11:47.260 --> 11:50.750
It shortens attention span, curbs
productivity, and it kills brain cells.

11:50.780 --> 11:52.866
Enough with the long sentences.

11:52.890 --> 11:54.880
Who can follow all that?

11:55.370 --> 11:56.646
Take a look at this.

11:56.670 --> 11:59.706
This is McGee before he tries
to break the hooker from hell.

11:59.730 --> 12:03.860
And this is him after
she gets into his head.

12:05.230 --> 12:07.986
How about a picture of you
actually working, DiNozzo?

12:08.010 --> 12:10.186
Um, I'm working on... on that.

12:10.210 --> 12:12.980
Yeah, Gibbs.Yeah.

12:13.610 --> 12:15.436
Maryland Women's Prison.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.000
Let's go.

12:17.670 --> 12:21.510
Wait. That's where McGee
is. Is everything okay?

12:22.070 --> 12:25.396
Everything's not okay.
What's happened? Gibbs!

12:25.420 --> 12:30.030
Abby... I'll call you, all right?

12:42.160 --> 12:43.726
They just started whaling on me.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.366
- They started it.
- What do we do?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.256
- But we finished it.
- No, we didn't finish anything.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.986
This is bad. They're not organized.

12:50.010 --> 12:52.486
- I just defended myself.
- What happened?

12:52.510 --> 12:55.220
Trimble came in,
bleeding like a stuck pig.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.976
Stay put! You stay back with the others.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.666
- Who did it?
- I didn't see anything.

12:59.690 --> 13:01.646
By the time I saw him, he
was already on the ground.

13:01.670 --> 13:04.346
- It could have been anybody.
- Somebody must have seen something.

13:04.370 --> 13:06.566
How are you doing?

13:06.590 --> 13:08.516
I think my arm's busted.

13:08.540 --> 13:09.616
What happened?

13:09.640 --> 13:10.716
One minute, everything's fine.

13:10.740 --> 13:14.186
The next, I saw Trimble stumble
in bleeding, then he want down.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.996
And they all just cut loose.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.336
We tried to restore order, but...

13:18.360 --> 13:20.986
Anyone see what happened to Trimble?

13:21.010 --> 13:23.136
You may not care about
your family, but I do...

13:23.160 --> 13:24.546
We got to get our families out of here.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.816
I say that we give up
before it's too late.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.156
That's a good idea.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.960
- Who's he?
- A cop.

13:33.810 --> 13:36.046
All right, they rush us,
you are the first to die.

13:36.070 --> 13:38.326
I'm not a cop; I'm an NCIS agent.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.516
Just as dead.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.820
Look, I got one year left.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.536
I just want to do my time, okay?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.946
They're gonna blame all
of us for killing Trimble.

13:44.970 --> 13:46.546
It doesn't matter how
much time you got left.

13:46.570 --> 13:47.826
We're all gonna suffer.

13:47.850 --> 13:51.290
Angela's right. We're gonna
have to protect ourselves.

13:54.510 --> 13:56.556
There are two points of
entry and an air duct.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.356
Now, will an air duct
support a man's weight?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.836
Come on, people. We need to
know this! Now, get on it.

14:02.860 --> 14:03.956
Who's in charge here?

14:03.980 --> 14:05.626
Gene Halsey, warden.

14:05.650 --> 14:08.756
Gibbs, NCIS. We've got an
agent here. Where is he?

14:08.780 --> 14:11.146
Visitor center. Inmates
have control of it.

14:11.170 --> 14:14.316
- He is alive?
- Don't know. The cameras are out.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.036
You plan to retake this by force?

14:16.060 --> 14:17.890
If they don't get out
of there real soon.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.340
Till then, I have this
entire prison on lockdown.

14:20.370 --> 14:21.306
And the hostages?

14:21.330 --> 14:24.866
This prison has a no-hostage policy,
meaning every man, woman and child

14:24.890 --> 14:28.056
who comes in those gates gives
up their right to be rescued.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.856
But believe me, I'm gonna do
everything I can to minimize casualties.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.016
I got men in there, too.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.270
Now, I'm kind of busy.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.546
You have much experience
in hostage recovery?

14:37.570 --> 14:39.786
- I have an emergency response plan.
- Okay.

14:39.810 --> 14:42.350
Have you ever put it into action?

14:45.380 --> 14:48.100
Take that as a no.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.066
The one on the left...
what's she in for?

15:00.090 --> 15:02.200
Angela Lopez.

15:02.230 --> 15:05.376
Armed robbery, kidnapping and murder.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.136
What about the one next to her?

15:07.160 --> 15:10.276
Sharon Bellows... she
killed her boyfriend.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.056
Claims he put her in
the hospital a few times.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.730
She called it self-defense.
Judge called it manslaughter.

15:17.970 --> 15:21.596
Judy Williams killed her
80-year-old neighbor for her meds.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.366
Kayla Vicari. Manufacturing meth.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.750
They want to send out an ear or
a finger to show we're serious.

15:27.780 --> 15:29.526
That's crazy.

15:29.550 --> 15:31.740
She's right.

15:35.130 --> 15:38.070
Shouldn't be a guard. That
will really piss them off.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.836
He screams, cut his throat.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.726
- I can't watch.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.800
You choose.

15:47.020 --> 15:49.840
- This is a bad idea.
- You got a better one?

15:52.080 --> 15:53.890
Abby.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.566
I got a bad feeling about
Bozo and his three-ring circus.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.826
Can we go over his head?

15:59.850 --> 16:02.280
It's his ball.

16:04.150 --> 16:07.166
Inmate using a confiscated radio
says they want to make some demands.

16:07.190 --> 16:09.276
Want to show me they're serious.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.780
- Show you?
- One of them's coming out.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.796
This is not your
jurisdiction, Agent Gibbs.

16:16.820 --> 16:19.550
How often do you do this sort of thing?

16:21.770 --> 16:23.730
Open up.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.280
I do the talking, you got that?

16:33.650 --> 16:36.420
Gonna find out who's
calling the shots here.

16:42.810 --> 16:45.560
- They let you go?
- Not exactly.

16:46.020 --> 16:48.296
I'm the negotiator.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.976
You're the negotiator?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.070
I sort of talked them into it.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.276
All right, what's the situation?

16:55.300 --> 16:59.826
Actually, I've been told I can only deal
directly with my boss, Special Agent Gibbs.

16:59.850 --> 17:02.500
They're watching us right now.

17:03.870 --> 17:05.006
Situation, McGee.

17:05.030 --> 17:08.026
Guards handcuffed in
the southwest corner.

17:08.050 --> 17:11.736
Inmates spread all over, armed
with batons and shards of glass.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.876
Casualties?

17:13.900 --> 17:17.766
There's one dead. A
guard, Hayden Trimble.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.406
But he wasn't killed in the riot.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.720
Looks like it's his
death that caused it.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.016
Another guard injured, Gordon Lambro.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.096
What happened?

17:25.119 --> 17:26.685
Trimble was stabbed.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.226
The guards tried to restore
order. Inmates responded.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.490
What do they want?

17:30.520 --> 17:33.706
Assurance that only Trimble's
killer will be punished,

17:33.730 --> 17:36.346
and amnesty for injuries
to the other guards.

17:36.370 --> 17:38.906
They are gonna hand
over Trimble's killer?

17:38.930 --> 17:41.080
Once we find out who did it.

17:41.110 --> 17:44.696
That's where I... you... we come in.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.636
They want NCIS to figure
out who Trimble's killer is.

17:48.660 --> 17:51.106
Which brings me to their last condition.

17:51.130 --> 17:54.250
No attempts to retake
the visitor center.

17:54.290 --> 18:00.186
If we agree, they'll release Trimble's
body, the injured guard and the visitors.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.920
That will leave myself and
two other guards as hostages.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.520
Get the doors.

18:17.550 --> 18:20.330
This way. Come on, folks. Come on.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.990
Move, move!

18:23.020 --> 18:24.530
Through the gate... keep moving.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.566
Move. Get them on the buses.

18:26.590 --> 18:29.496
- Right this way.
- Move them out. There we go.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.236
Quickly!

18:31.260 --> 18:34.440
Head count. 22 in, 22 out.

18:36.410 --> 18:37.406
Okay.

18:37.430 --> 18:41.260
For this to work, I'm gonna need
everyone's cooperation and trust.

18:41.290 --> 18:43.650
Trust a cop... that's
easier said than done.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.000
Uh, believe me, it's no harder
than me trusting a convicted felon.

18:50.350 --> 18:51.736
Now, first thing...

18:51.760 --> 18:55.486
we have to find a murder weapon,
so I am going to have to frisk you.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.990
- Frisk who?
- All of you.

19:03.660 --> 19:06.440
Who wants to go first?

19:10.610 --> 19:12.830
So much for cooperation.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.226
First murder, then a riot?

19:14.250 --> 19:15.966
And we have to solve the murder.

19:15.990 --> 19:18.740
Yeah, but it happened in a prison,
which we're not allowed into.

19:18.780 --> 19:20.436
Ducky gets here, I'm going in.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.890
If you get the chance.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.200
Agent Gibbs.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.890
Our guys are here.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.356
Inmates are spread throughout, which means
we got to move when they're grouped together.

19:29.380 --> 19:32.380
If my team figures this out,
everybody walks out of here.

19:32.420 --> 19:35.720
As long as this lasts, my prison
population feels empowered.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.256
One way or the other,
this ends at sundown.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.130
Means...

19:40.160 --> 19:42.636
you have seven hours
to end this, or I will.

19:42.660 --> 19:45.276
- Trimble have enemies?
- You could say that.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.790
Heroin's been pouring in.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.346
Trimble was my lead investigator.

19:48.370 --> 19:50.040
We were trying to turn off the spigot.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.806
Reason enough right
there to try to kill him.

19:52.830 --> 19:54.800
Start with Trimble.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.940
- Ziva.
- McGee is fine, Abby.

20:02.470 --> 20:06.276
Never thought I'd get the chance
to do this to you, Mr. Gibbs.

20:06.300 --> 20:09.720
Me, neither, Celia.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.936
Don't do anything stupid.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.730
Same applies to you, Lopez.

20:17.600 --> 20:20.010
I once sewed up the arm of a lion tamer,

20:20.070 --> 20:26.396
and he said the worst thing you can do is to let
your felines feel cornered, scared, or threatened.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.410
You mean like this, Duck?

20:34.510 --> 20:36.786
Nothing happens to him. You hear me?

20:36.810 --> 20:38.180
Or what?

20:38.210 --> 20:41.340
Or you'll wish you'd been
sentenced to death, not life.

20:41.370 --> 20:45.690
Oh, okay, you guys mess with this dude,
you mess with Brenda... good to know.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.600
From what I can tell,
this is where he fell.

20:51.630 --> 20:53.106
The body hasn't been moved.

20:53.130 --> 20:57.870
Single stab wound to
the chest. He bled out.

20:58.210 --> 21:00.800
And slowly.

21:01.490 --> 21:03.040
Can't find the murder weapon.

21:03.070 --> 21:05.926
Given the circumstances,
can't secure the crime scene.

21:05.950 --> 21:06.880
Keep looking.

21:06.910 --> 21:08.896
He has a head wound.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.200
It could have rendered him unconscious.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.120
I followed the blood trail out this way.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.750
Thanks.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.256
In here.

21:26.280 --> 21:30.276
This is the guards' bathroom,
off limits to the prisoners.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.190
He was stabbed in here.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.756
That's where his head was
slammed against the wall.

21:37.780 --> 21:39.800
Seat's down.

21:40.310 --> 21:42.016
Guess he wasn't here to use it.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.380
Figure he had company.

21:43.420 --> 21:44.926
You think, Sherlock?

21:44.950 --> 21:47.106
Women's prison... it happens.

21:47.130 --> 21:49.790
Shoot, even happens in men's prisons.

21:49.820 --> 21:52.186
Look, for this to work, we really
need to treat everyone as suspects.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.370
So please, just let us do this.

22:04.330 --> 22:06.490
They're coming in before sundown.

22:06.520 --> 22:07.976
Boss, that doesn't give
us enough time to...

22:08.000 --> 22:11.986
McGee. S.O.P.for
inmates to use the head.

22:12.010 --> 22:17.140
Guard inside the visitor center let them out here
into the corridor where Trimble was keeping watch.

22:17.170 --> 22:21.226
Trimble was supposed to notify the other guards
if he needs to use the bathroom; He never did.

22:21.250 --> 22:24.640
Probably 'cause he was doing
something he shouldn't have.

22:25.820 --> 22:28.866
Cost him his life. Cameras?

22:28.890 --> 22:31.756
- Only in the visitor center.
- Blood evidence.

22:31.780 --> 22:35.246
Most of the inmates and guards have blood on
them; I'm sure some of it's Trimble's, but...

22:35.270 --> 22:36.906
Doesn't single out anybody.

22:36.930 --> 22:39.810
Need to find his killer.

22:40.790 --> 22:44.040
Yeah, in a room full of them.

22:50.050 --> 22:51.570
They haven't hurt McGee, have they?

22:51.610 --> 22:53.016
We have not heard anything.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.096
Got something for you from
Trimble's apartment, Abby.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.926
We need to figure
this out before sunset.

22:56.950 --> 22:58.856
Define "before sunset."

22:58.880 --> 23:01.656
Before the sun goes down.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.550
Ethan Hawke movie with Julie...

23:04.860 --> 23:07.240
What was that for?

23:07.730 --> 23:10.096
The sun sets at around 5:02.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.396
So does that mean we have until 5:01?

23:12.420 --> 23:14.836
- Before sunset.
- That could mean now.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.786
Not good enough. I can't take this.

23:16.810 --> 23:20.420
Every day you guys go out and I never
know if you're going to make it back.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.556
It's killing me. I can't sleep at night.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.750
I'm developing some
sort of weird twitch.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.046
Our work is sometimes dangerous, Abby.

23:27.070 --> 23:28.446
Then get a safer job.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.236
Then you wouldn't see us at all.

23:30.260 --> 23:33.826
True. Still... sucks.

23:33.850 --> 23:35.220
Abby.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.926
Fingerprints, hard drive... bedsheets.

23:41.950 --> 23:45.096
Evidence of extracurricular activities.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.880
McGee's going to be okay, right?

23:46.920 --> 23:50.860
You kidding? Stuck in a women's
prison. It's every guy's fantasy.

23:53.190 --> 23:55.990
Well, maybe not McGee.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.610
Here. What's that?

23:58.820 --> 23:59.790
Check there.

23:59.820 --> 24:02.616
Look, can you... can you please
just all just give me some room here?

24:02.640 --> 24:07.226
It's very difficult looking for this murder
weapon with everyone in my way here, so...

24:07.250 --> 24:09.490
Come on, y'all.

24:10.250 --> 24:13.010
Thank you.

24:20.790 --> 24:23.910
- When's the food's coming?
- Soon.

24:24.870 --> 24:26.436
Pizza?

24:26.460 --> 24:28.526
Yeah, maybe.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.436
- Hey, you like pizza?
- Yeah...

24:30.460 --> 24:32.520
Pepperoni. You?

24:33.550 --> 24:36.280
Yeah, pepperoni's good.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.536
This sort of thing happen much?

24:41.560 --> 24:44.610
Never in my 15 years here.

24:45.390 --> 24:48.740
- You've known Celia since she's been in here?
- Yeah.

24:49.090 --> 24:51.600
She ever talk about what she did?

24:51.630 --> 24:54.820
Just to blame the system.

24:55.410 --> 24:58.446
You seem to have taken
responsibility for your crimes.

24:58.470 --> 25:00.456
It's a mixed blessing.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.676
First few years here, I
was angry at everybody.

25:02.700 --> 25:06.310
Blamed the world for
my crappy childhood.

25:07.100 --> 25:11.130
Then I got into a prison program
training seeing-eye dogs...

25:12.750 --> 25:16.566
One day I'm training
this puppy and it hits me.

25:16.590 --> 25:20.790
I killed an innocent person
who didn't do me no harm.

25:24.210 --> 25:27.480
Now I can't wait till the day I die,

25:28.060 --> 25:32.270
so I can find that soul and apologize
for the terrible thing I did.

25:35.310 --> 25:39.056
Look, I don't know if Celia
did the things they say.

25:39.080 --> 25:44.440
And if she did, I don't know what
it'll take for her to face up to it.

25:46.030 --> 25:47.596
Yeah, Abs?

25:47.620 --> 25:48.506
How's McGee?

25:48.530 --> 25:51.136
Well, he's fine. What do you got?

25:51.160 --> 25:52.436
Define "fine."

25:52.460 --> 25:55.570
He needs us to do our
job before sundown.

25:55.940 --> 26:00.676
Okay, Ducky found calcium oxalate
crystals in the dead guard's kidneys.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.396
Well, that's a huge red flag.

26:02.420 --> 26:05.976
So I ran a special tox screen
and, sure enough, it turned up.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.366
- What?
- Ethylene glycol.

26:08.390 --> 26:09.436
Antifreeze.

26:09.460 --> 26:12.090
Yeah, someone was poisoning him, Gibbs.

26:12.120 --> 26:16.960
He died from the stab wound, but with the
levels of ethylene glycol in Trimble's system,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.040
he was a dead man walking anyways.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.360
None of the sitors or the injured
guard saw Trimble get stabbed, Boss.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.870
The DEA is cross-checking all inmates
with links to known drug dealers.

26:34.910 --> 26:36.636
I got a feeling that's
going to be a long list.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.336
They're checking prison
employees, as well.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.316
Security footage.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.806
- Got it right here, boss.
- And?

26:40.830 --> 26:42.746
I'll be like your closed captioning.

26:42.770 --> 26:46.060
- My what?
- I'll talk. You listen.

26:46.560 --> 26:51.696
By my count, six inmates entered the
restroom corridor during visiting hours.

26:51.720 --> 26:53.266
Then we get Trimble.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.896
He enters, obviously hurt.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.706
Guard hurries to him.
Inmate lookie-loos hover.

26:58.730 --> 27:01.046
Push. Shove.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.336
Out comes the baton.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.616
Then static.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.786
- Static?
- Static.

27:06.810 --> 27:10.236
We got the PG version.
The Warden Halsey cut.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.406
Maybe he did not want to show
how physical his guards got.

27:13.430 --> 27:15.046
Or he has something else to hide.

27:15.070 --> 27:18.016
DiNozzo, give McGee the names of
all the women who used the head.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.010
Done, boss.

27:19.050 --> 27:20.656
I checked Trimble's
phone records, Gibbs.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.960
One person called him
over 150 times last month.

27:23.990 --> 27:28.336
It was another prison guard by
the name of... Brenda Carter.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.606
Five calls a day.

27:29.630 --> 27:32.116
I'd give her an eight on the
DiNozzo Psycho Chick Meter.

27:32.140 --> 27:34.656
Ten being Glenn Close
in Fatal Attraction.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.610
Look at those eyes, crazy eyes.

27:36.650 --> 27:39.290
- I'll send her over.
- Got it.

27:39.910 --> 27:41.840
Crazy eyes.

27:46.950 --> 27:48.806
I don't know why we couldn't
have done this at the prison.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.150
This could go down at any time.

27:50.180 --> 27:53.840
We want to stop it from
"going down," as you say.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.806
Okay, so you need to know
about these women, right?

27:56.830 --> 28:00.080
Actually, I'd prefer to know
more about Hayden Trimble.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.420
Okay.

28:02.450 --> 28:03.976
You knew him well?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.616
Yeah, sure. We worked together.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.676
Come on.

28:06.700 --> 28:09.416
It was more than just a working
relationship, was it not?

28:09.440 --> 28:10.846
We dated.

28:10.870 --> 28:12.200
When did he break up with you?

28:12.230 --> 28:15.206
We broke up last month.
But it was mutual.

28:15.230 --> 28:20.286
And since then, you have called him more than 150
times and he has not called you back even once.

28:20.310 --> 28:21.960
Does not sound very mutual to me.

28:21.990 --> 28:25.920
On our third date, he said he loved me.

28:25.950 --> 28:27.440
I didn't have to say it first.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.070
But you said it last.

28:31.430 --> 28:33.566
Men can be jerks. I know.

28:33.590 --> 28:36.026
You think that I...

28:36.050 --> 28:38.360
No, I was out of the
building when he was killed.

28:38.390 --> 28:39.846
Were you?

28:39.870 --> 28:42.480
Did you know that
someone was poisoning him?

28:44.760 --> 28:49.290
Okay, look, I-I might've thought about
wringing his neck, but I didn't kill him.

28:49.320 --> 28:53.200
Trimble was investigating
drug smuggling into the prison.

28:53.710 --> 28:55.716
He was avoiding me the last month.

28:55.740 --> 28:57.630
I thought he was seeing another woman.

28:57.660 --> 29:00.726
I left him a bunch of nasty messages.

29:00.750 --> 29:02.446
Drug investigation?

29:02.470 --> 29:04.870
According to Warden Halsey.

29:08.030 --> 29:09.960
What?

29:10.340 --> 29:12.830
It's probably nothing.

29:12.860 --> 29:15.796
But drug screening is
mandatory for all employees.

29:15.820 --> 29:16.736
So?

29:16.760 --> 29:19.116
So I'm friends with
the warden's assistant.

29:19.140 --> 29:22.726
She told me that the warden missed
his last mandatory drug screening.

29:22.750 --> 29:25.470
And he faked the one before that.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.940
What?

30:03.250 --> 30:08.700
My experience, whenever a cop wants to talk in
an interview room, nothing good comes of it.

30:10.340 --> 30:13.040
Look a bit jittery.

30:14.110 --> 30:16.290
Coming down with something.
Mind your business.

30:17.270 --> 30:20.220
Right now, my business is
investigating this crime.

30:20.250 --> 30:24.130
And we believe that Trimble's
murder could be drug-related.

30:25.070 --> 30:27.870
And it looks like you're
going through some withdrawal.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.800
- Really?
- Really.

30:31.930 --> 30:35.410
I don't like your tone.

30:57.930 --> 31:00.416
- Shut it down.
- It's my prison, Agent Gibbs.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.510
Not for long.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.636
You pee in a cup lately?

31:05.660 --> 31:07.720
I'm taking medication
for a heart condition.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.916
Prison Board might think
I can't handle the stress.

31:09.940 --> 31:11.916
Faking a drug test is a firing offense.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.616
You shut it down. Now!

31:13.640 --> 31:14.696
You blackmailing me?

31:14.720 --> 31:16.696
I'm negotiating. You said sundown.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.580
I said before sundown.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.856
Now you have less than two hours.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.860
After that, I'll take my
chance with the Prison Board.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.880
Heating. Lights.

31:37.420 --> 31:39.890
Great.

31:40.660 --> 31:42.616
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

31:42.640 --> 31:46.156
That's it. I'm finished.
I'm done, all right?

31:46.180 --> 31:48.486
You want to know who killed
Trimble, figure it out yourselves.

31:48.510 --> 31:49.356
See what you did?

31:49.380 --> 31:51.640
Maybe you'd think differently
if I took your ear.

31:51.670 --> 31:55.056
I've never hit a woman before, but if you
come at me with that thing, I will drop you.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.216
I got just one year left. I
got three kids to raise, please?

31:58.240 --> 32:01.446
They come in here shooting, you're
in the firing line, same as us.

32:01.470 --> 32:04.476
Shoot me up. Slice me up.
It doesn't matter, okay?

32:04.500 --> 32:05.936
Because I'm done.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.440
I'm done unless you tell me
the name of your supplier.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.636
- Now!
- Lambro.

32:13.660 --> 32:16.120
The guard you let out.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.366
Inmates gave you up.

32:26.390 --> 32:28.880
Women and secrets
make a bad combination.

32:28.910 --> 32:31.336
- What secrets?
- You're a dealer.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.836
- You believe them?
- Prison guard as an inmate.

32:33.860 --> 32:35.520
I hear they make you prom queen.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.046
And every night is prom night.

32:38.070 --> 32:41.420
You talk now and we'll make sure you're
not put in with the general population.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.110
They make some crazy
accusations and you believe them?

32:47.810 --> 32:49.100
I believe this.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.106
- Found it in your SUV.
- Must be a plant.

32:51.130 --> 32:53.156
I got no time for this, Lambro!

32:53.180 --> 32:54.340
Now you've made him angry.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.036
Trimble was onto your operation.

32:56.060 --> 32:58.166
- No... no.
- First you poisoned him.

32:58.190 --> 33:01.820
- Then you stabbed him.
- No, you've got this so freaking wrong!

33:07.000 --> 33:11.166
I was dealing, but I didn't kill him.

33:11.190 --> 33:15.750
Trimble wasn't trying to bring down the
drug operation. He was the head of it.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.040
Thank you.

33:26.070 --> 33:29.070
DEA says Trimble's stepbrother
is a known drug dealer.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.890
Could be Trimble's drug source.

33:30.930 --> 33:33.796
Supports Lambro's story that
Trimble headed the operation.

33:33.820 --> 33:35.200
Doesn't get Lambro off the hook.

33:35.230 --> 33:38.366
Well, maybe Lambro wanted
to take over the operation.

33:38.390 --> 33:41.460
Maybe he has a different supply source.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.290
Where does that leave us?

33:43.330 --> 33:45.886
With a lot of maybes. Yeah. Gibbs.

33:45.910 --> 33:48.340
- Can you come to the lab?
- I'll be right there.

33:54.390 --> 33:55.586
What are you doing?

33:55.610 --> 33:58.826
Tapping into Trimble's e-mail
account on the prison network.

33:58.850 --> 34:01.290
And they call us criminals.

34:02.460 --> 34:04.046
What?

34:04.070 --> 34:06.896
You are a criminal, Celia.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.960
You don't know me.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.275
What do you got, Abby?

34:22.300 --> 34:24.326
Okay, I might have overstepped
my bounds here a little bit.

34:24.350 --> 34:25.976
- I-I know I'm not a field agent.
- Abs.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.386
I called the prison and I
got Lambro's work schedule.

34:28.409 --> 34:29.045
Okay, because?

34:29.070 --> 34:34.525
Because I wanted to compare Lambro's schedule to
when the antifreeze showed up in Trimble's system.

34:34.550 --> 34:38.335
I also got the urine from
Trimble's last drug test.

34:38.360 --> 34:42.610
He was clean for illegal drugs, but I was able
to figure out when he ingested the antifreeze.

34:42.639 --> 34:47.449
24 hours before the test, Lambro was at a
conference in Pennsylvania for a whole week,

34:47.489 --> 34:49.239
so it couldn't have been him.

34:49.270 --> 34:53.909
Oh, by the way, if they ask you
at the prison, I'm your boss.

34:54.730 --> 34:56.065
Wait, Gibbs, there's more.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.710
I analyzed Trimble's bedsheets.

34:57.750 --> 35:00.096
There is no direct match
to anyone at the prison.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.986
- Direct match?
- Exactly.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.536
That's where it gets interesting.

35:03.560 --> 35:08.810
The DNA on Trimble's bedsheets belongs
to a relative of a current inmate.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.256
Zoe Bellows. Mother is Sharon Bellows.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.430
Sentenced to ten years
for killing her boyfriend.

35:15.470 --> 35:18.596
She claimed he was abusive and had
some medical history to back it up.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.286
One year left on her sentence.

35:20.310 --> 35:20.916
The daughter.

35:20.940 --> 35:24.110
She was not at the visitor
center when Trimble died.

35:24.140 --> 35:27.036
- Sun goes down in 63 minutes, boss.
- Bring the girl in.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.510
Find me a paper trail.

35:34.350 --> 35:37.550
- How you doing?
- Okay.

35:40.710 --> 35:43.770
- You know this man?
- No.

35:55.670 --> 35:58.530
We found your DNA on his bed.

35:59.310 --> 36:01.760
- Where is he?
- Dead.

36:07.910 --> 36:10.930
First time he saw me,
I was visiting my mom.

36:12.480 --> 36:16.310
The way he was looking at
me just gave me the creeps.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.880
And then he found out
where I went to school.

36:20.070 --> 36:23.406
And then one day he was waiting for me.

36:23.430 --> 36:27.300
He said he would hurt
her if I... if I didn't...

36:27.630 --> 36:29.226
you know.

36:29.250 --> 36:32.840
He said his friends would
kill my mom if I told on him.

36:33.300 --> 36:37.350
The first time he did it, I
was so disgusted, I threw up.

36:38.910 --> 36:42.270
Then he started shooting me up.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.180
Between my toes.

36:46.780 --> 36:49.796
- You tell your mother?
- No.

36:49.820 --> 36:52.416
So you took matters into your own hands?

36:52.440 --> 36:55.250
I just wanted him to stop...

36:55.590 --> 36:57.566
and he just wouldn't.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.680
Spiking his drinks with antifreeze?

37:02.330 --> 37:04.820
I killed him.

37:05.620 --> 37:08.240
No, you didn't.

37:08.850 --> 37:12.020
But you, you said he was dead.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.056
DiNozzo.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.080
- The car.Now.
- On it. Okay.

37:24.830 --> 37:28.630
Several of the inmates here have identified
the girl in that photo as your daughter.

37:28.660 --> 37:32.966
How did you find out that she and
Trimble were having a relationship?

37:32.990 --> 37:37.166
You saw that photo. She
didn't want to be there.

37:37.190 --> 37:40.570
- He was e-mailing it around to the other guards.
- What?

37:41.340 --> 37:45.790
Did one of them show
you? Or did Trimble?

37:50.310 --> 37:53.760
Sharon, you found out
about it and you killed him.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.670
One year... that's
all I have left.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.576
Had left.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.836
I have two other daughters.
They're ten and they're 12.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.546
At least I could still
be a good mother to them.

38:04.570 --> 38:06.396
Not anymore, honey.

38:06.420 --> 38:08.850
They're my babies.

38:10.690 --> 38:13.590
They're bringing dinner. On carts.

38:16.130 --> 38:17.556
Call 'em back.

38:17.580 --> 38:18.816
It's too late, Agent Gibbs.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.740
I said call 'em back!

38:23.650 --> 38:27.496
Sharon, if they come through that
door, people are going to get hurt.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.966
You're going to get
us all killed, Bellows.

38:28.990 --> 38:30.720
Come on, Sharon.

38:30.750 --> 38:33.686
Please. Please.

38:33.710 --> 38:36.426
They stopped. They're
not bringing in the food.

38:36.450 --> 38:39.380
I really don't think they got any.

38:45.980 --> 38:48.336
- Yeah.
- Zoe Bellows.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.356
Already on it, boss.

38:49.380 --> 38:52.310
- Two minutes, McGee.
- Got to go.

38:54.520 --> 38:57.160
Where is she?

39:08.430 --> 39:10.780
Sharon.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.840
Sharon.

39:20.930 --> 39:24.270
Tell the warden he can
have Trimble's killer.

39:34.050 --> 39:35.450
Sometimes this job sucks.

39:35.490 --> 39:38.076
Sharon Bellows was in for
killing an abusive boyfriend.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.336
And while she's inside, her daughter's
being abused. Trimble was scum.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.290
Makes no difference
in the eyes of the law.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.676
Hence the word "sucks."

39:44.700 --> 39:45.706
- Yeah.
- On my way out.

39:45.730 --> 39:47.380
Okay.

39:49.020 --> 39:52.056
My agent's coming out.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.630
Stand by.

40:01.680 --> 40:04.120
- Where is she?
- Saying good-bye.

40:06.050 --> 40:09.130
- You okay, McGee?
- Yeah.

40:09.710 --> 40:11.800
Did any of them hurt you, McGee?

40:11.830 --> 40:14.230
I will kick their ass.

40:14.260 --> 40:16.000
I'm fine, Ziva.

40:16.030 --> 40:18.370
- She's coming out.
- Door's opening.

40:30.290 --> 40:31.986
McGee.

40:32.010 --> 40:35.090
That's not who I was
expecting to see, boss.

40:39.590 --> 40:42.240
That's your murder weapon.

40:43.090 --> 40:45.810
I killed Trimble.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.086
- They're ready to give up.
- Move in.

40:50.110 --> 40:51.706
- Let's go.
- Move. Go.

40:51.730 --> 40:53.810
Don't hurt them.

40:56.870 --> 41:00.506
Trimble was raping
Sharon Bellows' daughter.

41:00.530 --> 41:02.086
And smuggling drugs.

41:02.110 --> 41:03.576
Was Sharon in on it?

41:03.600 --> 41:06.226
No, all my own work.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.236
Sharon didn't want a part of it.

41:08.260 --> 41:11.500
Just wants to get out
and be a mom again.

41:13.620 --> 41:16.286
That sailor you were asking me about.

41:16.310 --> 41:18.356
Lieutenant Poletto.

41:18.380 --> 41:21.170
I killed him, too.

41:22.770 --> 41:25.880
Sorry I did.

41:26.890 --> 41:28.076
That a confession?

41:28.100 --> 41:30.750
I'll write it all down for you.

41:43.550 --> 41:46.136
Do any of us really believe
that Celia killed Trimble?

41:46.160 --> 41:48.326
I don't think anyone is going
to lose any sleep over it.

41:48.350 --> 41:50.430
You write it up, Tim.

41:50.910 --> 41:54.476
McGee, you're home.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.066
Good to see you, too, Abs.

41:56.090 --> 41:58.706
We had total confidence in you, McGee.

41:58.730 --> 42:01.150
Obviously.

42:01.700 --> 42:04.080
Well, maybe just a moment of doubt.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.170
McGee.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.686
You told me my car would be ready today.

42:13.710 --> 42:16.150
One octave or two?

42:17.480 --> 42:20.506
Listen up because this is
what you're going to do.

42:20.530 --> 42:24.770
You're going to take the first estimate and
you're going to reduce it by ten percent.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.510
Then, you're going to find
my part, install the part,

42:28.540 --> 42:31.186
and have my car parked
out front and ready for me

42:31.210 --> 42:34.570
when I walk out of this
building in 32 minutes.

42:35.210 --> 42:38.566
Who would guess that McGee would
grow a pair in a women's prison?

42:38.590 --> 42:41.306
I put away killers for a
living. That's what I do.

42:41.330 --> 42:47.090
Now, you do exactly as I told you and
we won't have any problems. Understood?

42:48.590 --> 42:51.720
Good. Clock's ticking.

42:52.230 --> 42:54.200
Wow, McGee.

42:54.230 --> 42:57.460
Your time in the Big
House really changed you.

42:58.320 --> 42:59.890
I like it.
