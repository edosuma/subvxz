WEBVTT

00:20.896 --> 00:23.232
Lord Trenchard. Payment in full.

00:23.232 --> 00:26.235
Ah. He of the beautiful wife.

00:26.235 --> 00:28.237
Dr. Ellerby.

00:28.237 --> 00:30.114
An invitation
to an art exhibition.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.199
He's persistent, the doctor.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.243
He's being friendly, that's all.

00:34.243 --> 00:39.707
Shh. Follow me.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.751
You know
about the steel foundry?

00:41.751 --> 00:43.753
<i>I'm thinking of investing in it.</i>

00:43.753 --> 00:45.880
A lot of money, Your Lordship.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.131
You're satisfied then, <i>madame.</i>

00:47.131 --> 00:50.092
I wish all my investments
ran as smoothly.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.094
We must plan
another venture together soon.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.471
Ah!

00:53.471 --> 00:56.682
Perhaps.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.143
- What is it?
- I was thinking about my father.

00:59.143 --> 01:02.730
He'd be proud of you, surely.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.106
Personally, I think
it's in our natures

01:04.106 --> 01:05.232
to run away
from difficult feelings.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.859
But if we have the courage
to confront them,

01:06.859 --> 01:09.236
<i>we can let go
of a great deal of pain.</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:11.280
<i>How is my brother?</i>

01:11.280 --> 01:15.117
He is very much troubled
by thoughts of his father.

01:15.117 --> 01:18.537
It might help Frederick
if you would speak to him.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.666
You thought
you would befriend her

01:22.666 --> 01:24.376
and whisper poison
in her ears about me?

01:24.376 --> 01:26.712
- No, I didn't.
- Leave my house!

01:28.547 --> 01:30.216
<i>You went behind my back.</i>

01:32.009 --> 01:34.428
- Why would you do that?
- I didn't know.

02:57.928 --> 03:01.473
<i>When did you
first meet him?</i>

03:01.473 --> 03:02.808
<i>A little over
a week ago.</i>

03:02.808 --> 03:04.393
<i>Where?</i>

03:04.393 --> 03:08.397
I told you.
I went to the vicarage.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.773
Once.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.443
You know me well enough.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.486
You know I think only of you.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.280
I thought it might help you.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.408
You have so much pain
locked in your heart.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.577
That's how you see me?
As some injured creature

03:21.577 --> 03:23.412
- who must be helped?
- No.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.413
- Is that what he implied?
- No.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.789
What did he say about me?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.333
That there was a rift
with your father,

03:27.333 --> 03:28.626
which was not of your making.

03:28.626 --> 03:31.253
- How magnanimous.
- He said he misses you,

03:31.253 --> 03:33.464
that he longs to be reconciled.

03:33.464 --> 03:36.342
He seemed genuine, Frederick.

03:36.342 --> 03:38.677
Honestly, I still believe that
if you could only talk together.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.888
You don't know him.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.942
<i>Did you know
he had a brother?</i>

03:52.942 --> 03:54.234
<i>Of course I did.</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:55.945
Mr. Enright and I
were at Glanville

03:55.945 --> 03:57.321
when the two boys
were growing up.

03:57.321 --> 03:58.822
So, what went on?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.282
It must've been
an almighty falling out.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.617
Don't know.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.285
Lots of brothers fall out.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.829
Yeah, but...

04:05.829 --> 04:07.164
I fell out of my lot
all the time.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.916
I mean, we had fights,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.542
punch-ups that went on
for hours.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.294
- Did you?
- Of course.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.504
But then you
sit down at the table,

04:13.504 --> 04:15.714
and your ma gives you
a bowl of stew

04:15.714 --> 04:17.299
and that's the end of it.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.553
They're going up.

04:23.722 --> 04:29.269
None of this is to be discussed
outside this house or in it.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.854
I hope that's understood.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.147
It is.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.485
Off you go.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.821
- Good night then, Mr. Enright.
- Good night.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.213
So, things are still bad
between the brothers.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.008
Seems that way.

04:59.008 --> 05:01.927
I never really understood.

05:01.927 --> 05:04.513
Is it jealousy?

05:04.513 --> 05:06.974
- Rivalry?
- I know no more than you.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.935
What do I see
stuck in the kitchen all day?

05:12.062 --> 05:14.940
Why does it bother you so much?
You're shaking.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.608
I failed him.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.156
I should have found a way
to warn him, Madeleine.

05:22.156 --> 05:25.617
He's a grown man.
Let him deal with his own mess.

05:30.581 --> 05:33.500
From my grandmama's recipe.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.211
I rarely venture
into the kitchen, of course,

05:36.211 --> 05:37.963
but if it meets
with your approval,

05:37.963 --> 05:40.758
I shall be supplying five
for the cake stall.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.804
That is the finest fruit cake
I have ever tasted.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.514
And I have tasted a good many.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.768
Good. That's decided then.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.811
I shall set my shoulder
to the wheel.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.396
Thank you.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.902
I hear you met my sister.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.406
I did. It was a pleasure.

06:04.406 --> 06:08.368
Oh, yes, she's all charm.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.627
...there in good time.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.670
I... I think we timed
that well, Your Ladyship.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.380
It'll be so hot in half an hour

06:20.380 --> 06:23.634
that there'd be no pleasure
in a walk.

06:34.478 --> 06:35.854
How can I help?

06:38.148 --> 06:42.069
Your Ladyship.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.071
Shall I ask them to bring you
some coffee, Your Ladyship?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.323
Yes, please.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.409
Davison?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.671
- Reverend.
- Forgive me.

07:00.671 --> 07:03.340
Five minutes of your time
is all I ask.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.810
I think this will be
the last time we ever meet.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.604
I fear that's true.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.315
I want to say two things to you.

07:20.315 --> 07:24.486
I am so sorry
I came to the house yesterday.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.863
I should never have done that.

07:25.863 --> 07:29.032
It was my fault.
I gave you hope.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.118
I... I can't live
with the thought

07:31.118 --> 07:33.495
that I've caused difficulty
between you and Frederick.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.290
Lady Trenchard,
please don't think badly of him

07:36.290 --> 07:38.542
for the way he behaved yesterday
or for any of this.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.879
He's not to blame.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.339
Please tell me you will
always remember that.

07:44.339 --> 07:47.509
I wish I understood more about
what happened with your father,

07:47.509 --> 07:49.261
and with you.

07:49.261 --> 07:54.141
His attitude is so... entrenched.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.602
Was there one particular event?

07:56.602 --> 07:57.603
An argument?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.691
He mentioned that
when your father was dying,

08:02.691 --> 08:05.110
he wanted only you
at his bedside.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.320
Is that true?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.572
It...

08:08.572 --> 08:11.074
It was my father's decision.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
And I couldn't go
against his wishes.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.582
And what of your mother?
Couldn't she have persuaded him?

08:18.582 --> 08:22.920
Our mother was a strong
and beautiful woman,

08:22.920 --> 08:24.546
but she expected
the same strength

08:24.546 --> 08:27.633
in everyone else.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.384
And when she died,

08:29.384 --> 08:30.677
please tell me
she wanted Frederick there.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.512
She did.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.556
Very much.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.975
She asked for him.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.102
And did anything happen
between you then?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.647
Was that the last time
you saw one another?

08:41.647 --> 08:44.733
He wasn't able to come.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.778
But he came to the funeral,
though we didn't speak.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.156
He didn't go to her...

08:51.156 --> 08:53.367
when she was dying?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.952
Why?

08:54.952 --> 08:57.371
I think...

08:57.371 --> 08:59.748
perhaps it was the fear,

08:59.748 --> 09:02.084
the memory
of our father's death.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.588
Perhaps it was better
that he didn't come.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.800
How can you say so?

09:09.800 --> 09:14.596
Nothing would have kept me
from my father's deathbed.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.431
The wounds are deep.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.016
Do you see?

09:18.016 --> 09:20.143
It was years...

09:22.771 --> 09:24.773
It would be too much
for any soul.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.234
I can't help feeling

09:27.234 --> 09:29.194
that there's something
you're not telling me.

09:29.194 --> 09:32.948
I'm sorry, but if there's
anything, anything at all,

09:32.948 --> 09:35.867
which might help me
to understand him better.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.494
There is no more to be said.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.000
My own sadness
at the loss of him,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.085
I must bear...

09:45.085 --> 09:47.796
I will bear.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.173
But... But I have to know
that he will always,

09:50.173 --> 09:52.092
always have your love
and support.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.806
Thank you.

10:03.562 --> 10:06.315
He was not to blame.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.867
So, I'm asking the ladies
if they have experience

10:16.867 --> 10:19.453
in looking after the elephants.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.456
The white elephant, Hetty dear.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.000
White Elephant Stall.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.127
It's a very different proposition.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.879
We are not recruiting <i>mahouts.</i>

10:51.068 --> 10:53.320
You see there?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.905
They're reintroducing
carbon and manganese.

10:54.905 --> 10:55.864
Ah!

10:55.864 --> 10:57.783
Exact amount.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.536
Damned impressive!
Damned impressive!

11:01.536 --> 11:03.246
Like the mouth of hell!

11:03.246 --> 11:04.956
- I'm glad you're able to see it.
- I'll say.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.750
Thank you for inviting me.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.753
To think that is going all day,
every day...

11:09.753 --> 11:12.881
- And through the night.
- It's astonishing.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.550
Well, to you, my clever friend,

11:15.550 --> 11:19.304
and his expanding kingdom,
the strange land of East End.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.768
No wonder the Marquise
is so impressed by you.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.187
Never tires
of singing your praises.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.273
You know she's trying to enlist
me into this new scheme of hers.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.110
Did you put her up to it?
I suspect you did.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.278
Ah, yes.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.905
- Which one?
- The silver mine.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.782
Mexico.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.951
Doubt I could place it on a map.

11:40.951 --> 11:44.121
She seems utterly confident
in the venture, doesn't she?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.580
What do you think of it?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.707
Well, I need more
information, of course.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.959
Quite right.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.837
The figures involved.
I had no idea.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.171
I told her
business isn't my bag.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.756
Do you know what?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.925
For a first little foray,
it seems rather thrilling.

11:56.925 --> 12:02.973
"Untold riches
in an exotic land."

12:02.973 --> 12:05.559
When did she mention it to you?
Out of interest.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.935
About a week ago.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.895
Don't tell me
I've missed the deadline.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.815
Uh... no.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.817
At least I don't think so.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.027
I shall be led by you.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.071
Rather jolly
to be partners, what?

12:23.034 --> 12:24.119
I thought we might
go out together

12:24.119 --> 12:25.620
sometime in the next few days.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.957
The exhibition of paintings
I mentioned.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.375
Do you remember?

12:30.375 --> 12:32.127
It's tomorrow.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.795
I thought we might
attend together.

12:33.795 --> 12:34.921
I'm afraid
I can't spare the time,

12:34.921 --> 12:38.216
but you should go
if you'd like to.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.886
Alone?

12:40.886 --> 12:42.012
Although I must say
I'm surprised,

12:42.012 --> 12:45.974
was the invitation
not from Dr. Ellerby?

12:45.974 --> 12:49.769
Yes, but the works are not his,
from what I understand.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.230
He was simply bringing it
to our attention.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.024
I thought the Rochesters
might attend.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.484
I doubt they will.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.444
Well, let's do
something else then.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.987
It might be good for us

12:58.987 --> 13:00.864
- to have the opportunity to--
- Clara.

13:00.864 --> 13:04.409
I have thought on this,
and it is my wish...

13:04.409 --> 13:07.496
that we endeavor to forget
the events of yesterday.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.830
Frederick--

13:08.830 --> 13:11.082
I accept,
albeit with some difficulty,

13:11.082 --> 13:13.293
that you thought
your actions might be helpful.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.046
I accept it.

13:16.046 --> 13:20.634
But frankly, I cannot sit
at dinner every night,

13:20.634 --> 13:24.012
wondering when my wife
will insist on raising matters

13:24.012 --> 13:27.682
that can only be the cause
of the deepest discomfort to me.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.018
I hope you are able
to understand that.

13:30.018 --> 13:34.731
I am able
to understand it. Yes.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.070
I didn't mean...

13:41.905 --> 13:44.783
Please...
Please, can we leave it at that?

14:01.967 --> 14:05.053
Sorry.
I had a few minutes to spare.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.097
Please don't apologize.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.101
May I ask you
a question, Reverend?

14:11.101 --> 14:13.478
Of course.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.356
Do you think
the dead feel lonely?

14:16.356 --> 14:20.944
No. I don't.

14:20.944 --> 14:26.241
I think those in heaven
feel awash with warmth and love.

14:26.241 --> 14:30.245
What if they aren't in heaven?

14:30.245 --> 14:31.997
Through no fault of their own.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.000
God is love

14:35.000 --> 14:36.126
and would never
turn someone away

14:36.126 --> 14:37.919
if they were innocent.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.591
Loneliness
is an earthly affliction.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.134
We can feel lonely

14:44.134 --> 14:47.053
even in a room
full of people, can't we?

14:47.053 --> 14:51.391
Are you concerned about
someone in particular, Nell?

14:51.391 --> 14:52.934
Ah, Reverend, here you are.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.146
Miss Dunn.
How are you getting on?

14:56.146 --> 14:59.524
Might we have a few minutes
of your precious time?

14:59.524 --> 15:00.942
Only I have to deliver
the wording of the handbook

15:00.942 --> 15:02.902
to the printers
by the end of tomorrow.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.195
The fundraising objectives.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.905
I was supposed to write them
down for you.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.324
Please don't worry.

15:07.324 --> 15:10.035
I've taken the liberty
of outlining a few myself.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.037
Repairs to the clock
at 15 pounds.

15:12.037 --> 15:15.707
Cemetery wall repairs, I think
you mentioned at 38 pounds.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.125
My goodness. What a memory.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.170
Yes, yes.
Let's look at them now.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.885
The teacups need washing,
Nell, if you don't mind.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.311
Good afternoon.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.521
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

15:38.521 --> 15:42.734
Our catalogue,
if you would care to look.

15:42.734 --> 15:46.196
Mr. Dearden.
I'm one of the exhibitors.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.947
I always think it best
to mention that

15:47.947 --> 15:51.201
before someone says something
which breaks my heart.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.745
Oh...

15:53.745 --> 15:55.622
And might I have your name?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.749
Of course. Lady Trenchard.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.334
Ah.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.795
I received an invitation
from Dr. Ellerby.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.839
Yes. Yes.
How kind of you to come.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.592
Stephen--Dr. Ellerby--
will be delighted.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.136
I'm afraid he isn't here
at present.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.597
Ah.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.182
Is the Duchess of Rochester
here, perhaps?

16:14.182 --> 16:17.185
She was, earlier.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.771
Would you like me to show you
around, Lady Trenchard?

16:19.771 --> 16:23.775
- I would gladly.
- Thank you.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.485
I shall manage very well.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.028
I'm here
if you have need of me.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.382
I've heard nothing at all about
a silver mine, Your Lordship.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.718
- I'd remember if I had.
- Then you should have done.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.303
You're quick enough
to boast about your contacts.

16:52.303 --> 16:54.472
May I ask
who's behind the scheme?

16:54.472 --> 16:56.391
Would you like me
to make inquiries of them?

16:56.391 --> 16:59.310
No. I shall deal with it myself.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.521
If I hear anything at all,
I shall alert you at once,

17:01.521 --> 17:02.981
You may depend on it.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.293
Sir.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.017
Lady Trenchard
is looking at it now.

17:44.189 --> 17:47.192
Extraordinary,
isn't it?

17:47.192 --> 17:48.276
Dr. Ellerby.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.153
Lady Trenchard.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.572
- Miss Davison.
- Sir.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.324
Is His Lordship with you?

17:54.324 --> 17:57.202
- Unfortunately not.
- Then I'm all the more grateful

17:57.202 --> 18:00.330
that you took the trouble
to come.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.165
Have you ever visited
a gallery before?

18:02.165 --> 18:04.876
Once, with my father.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.753
It was at the Royal Academy.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.339
There was certainly
nothing in this style.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.132
That should be music
to your ears, Dearden.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.219
Lady Trenchard,
allow me to present--

18:14.219 --> 18:16.137
I've already had the pleasure.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.723
This is one of your works,
Mr. Dearden?

18:18.723 --> 18:20.141
It is.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.894
It's beautiful.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.814
And emotional, somehow.

18:25.814 --> 18:28.691
I couldn't have hoped
for a kinder review.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.902
- Have you seen the Rossettis?
- Mm.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.695
Mine rather pale beside his.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.405
I can't agree with you.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.201
Yes, they're arresting.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.911
He's my idol...

18:39.911 --> 18:42.580
as you can probably tell.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.959
We expect him later,
with Mrs. Morris.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.336
If you're able to stay,
I will gladly introduce you.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.005
I'm afraid I have to leave now.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.424
- Thank you.
- To the next time, perhaps.

18:53.424 --> 18:57.804
Allow me to see you out.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.181
I'm so sorry I wasn't here
when you arrived.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.183
I help at a mission
twice a week.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.644
And we had more patients
than usual today.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.607
The advice you gave me
at Maywood,

19:09.607 --> 19:11.776
about encouraging people
to confront their fears.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.236
Yes?

19:13.236 --> 19:17.448
Do you think it's possible
to push too hard...

19:17.448 --> 19:21.452
and to compound the difficulty
where one was trying to help?

19:21.452 --> 19:23.371
I think anyone who's being asked

19:23.371 --> 19:25.248
to look at something
that frightens them

19:25.248 --> 19:28.042
is bound to show
some resistance.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.752
Antagonism, even.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.380
I would say that
some part of them,

19:32.380 --> 19:34.299
no matter how deeply buried,

19:34.299 --> 19:36.009
would have to want to change.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.344
I hope my advice
wasn't ill-judged.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.805
No.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.267
How <i>are</i> you?

19:44.267 --> 19:46.394
You seem a little sad,
if you don't mind my saying.

19:46.394 --> 19:53.276
I'm perfectly well.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.612
Have you ever seen
inside an artist studio?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.196
Or watched an artist at work?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.241
I lodge with Dearden,

20:00.241 --> 20:03.202
and his studio is really
something to see.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.245
If you would ever care
to visit...

20:04.245 --> 20:06.915
I know he would be honored.

20:06.915 --> 20:10.168
I'll bear it in mind.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.371
Sorry, Miss Dunn.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.748
Where on earth
did you learn to play like that?

21:30.748 --> 21:33.668
I... um...

21:33.668 --> 21:36.921
It's hardly a music hall ditty.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.381
Chopin, wasn't it?

21:38.381 --> 21:43.511
I... hear tunes,
and they stay with me.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.264
But where could you
have heard it?

21:48.558 --> 21:50.518
I don't remember.

21:50.518 --> 21:53.813
Right.

21:53.813 --> 21:57.442
And yet you remember
all the notes.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.235
It's quite a gift.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.032
Is everything tidied away?

22:04.032 --> 22:06.868
Yes, miss.
I'll fetch my things.

22:12.623 --> 22:13.958
And did you eat all your tea?

22:13.958 --> 22:15.918
Yes, Papa.

22:15.918 --> 22:17.295
Good man.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.550
Now, now, come on,
back to Nanny.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.510
And I shall come upstairs
with you and see Peter.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.429
Can I see Peter?

22:26.429 --> 22:28.222
Peter is ill, isn't he?

22:28.222 --> 22:30.391
He doesn't wish
for you to get ill.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.603
I'll give him a kiss from you.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.566
<i>What did you think
of Mr. Dearden's paintings?</i>

22:38.566 --> 22:41.944
They weren't to my taste.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.739
Too florid. For all the words
written in there

22:44.739 --> 22:47.450
about a "true representation
of nature,"

22:47.450 --> 22:51.788
I should say it didn't look
anything like the nature I know.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.291
I should say it was overblown
and overly romantic.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.628
I'm not sure anything
can be "overly romantic."

22:58.628 --> 23:03.257
That's because you're young,
Your Ladyship.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.895
I shall get off now, Reverend.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.022
I've left some cold cuts
on the side,

23:18.022 --> 23:19.774
and there's soup
if you'd like it.

23:19.774 --> 23:23.528
Thank you.

23:23.528 --> 23:24.654
Would you care to join me?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.989
Oh, I'm afraid I can't.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.908
My daughter and her family
are waiting.

23:28.908 --> 23:32.870
- Good.
- But thank you, sir.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.705
I shall see you in the morning.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.250
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Warren.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.228
He's not back then?

23:57.228 --> 23:59.647
Not yet.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.649
I believe he is at his club.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.276
Oh...

24:03.276 --> 24:05.695
Difficult business, marriage.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.489
Seems so.

24:08.489 --> 24:12.034
You never thought of it
for yourself, then?

24:12.034 --> 24:13.953
I like my own way too much.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.124
You?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.333
The same.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.927
Thank you,
Your Lordship.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.795
Going for an evening stroll.

25:04.795 --> 25:08.507
Back before I lock up.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.318
I thought
you were fetching me some coal.

28:14.318 --> 28:17.196
Certainly am, Mrs. Enright.
Never fear.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.324
<i>A stamp for this, please.</i>

28:20.324 --> 28:22.660
Where's it going?

28:24.495 --> 28:26.414
Can't read?

28:26.414 --> 28:28.916
Of course you can't.
Pass it here.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.346
- Where is it goin--
- In the box.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.472
Yes, sir.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.402
His Lordship has left?

28:56.402 --> 28:57.903
Yes, Your Ladyship.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.738
An early appointment.

29:05.744 --> 29:11.041
But it was Dr. Moorcroft's
orders, Your Grace.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.627
I'm not blaming you, Dawes.

29:13.627 --> 29:16.797
I will speak to the doctor
myself on his next visit.

29:16.797 --> 29:20.009
But until then, I do not want
the dose increased.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.845
The poor boy sleeps enough
as it is.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.263
Yes, Your Grace.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.682
Thank you.
Please return to him.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.810
Problem, my dear?

29:29.810 --> 29:31.937
Not one you need
concern yourself with...

29:31.937 --> 29:34.732
or would wish to, it seems.

29:54.502 --> 29:57.922
- What are you doing, dear?
- Oh! Mother!

29:57.922 --> 29:59.048
Must you?

29:59.048 --> 30:00.633
What?

30:00.633 --> 30:04.470
- Creep.
- Oh, I wasn't creeping.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.971
I... I thought you were Nell.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.015
She's at the shop, dear.

30:08.015 --> 30:11.018
I know.

30:11.018 --> 30:15.439
I've mislaid a handkerchief,
and I thought...

30:15.439 --> 30:18.526
she might have mixed it up
with one of hers...

30:18.526 --> 30:20.069
in the wash.

30:20.069 --> 30:24.198
You don't think she's...

30:24.198 --> 30:25.699
stealing from us, do you?

30:25.699 --> 30:27.868
I mean, that would be
too dreadful.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.703
I beg your pardon?

30:29.703 --> 30:34.041
I suppose we...
we do know so little about her.

30:34.041 --> 30:36.126
I wasn't implying that at all.

30:36.126 --> 30:42.841
Good heavens, what a dark
and suspicious mind you have.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.301
Oh.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.558
Well, come out, Mother.
We shouldn't be in here.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.270
Right.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.077
- Lord Trenchard?
- Yes.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.078
<i>Madame</i> is expecting you.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.376
There's been
some trial and error,

31:17.376 --> 31:20.546
but we now seem to have
the balance exactly right.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.797
I fully expect
to be signing a deal

31:21.797 --> 31:23.340
with Great Eastern next week

31:23.340 --> 31:25.009
to provide the rails
for their latest expansion.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.387
This is excellent, Frederick.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.931
We mean to switch to producing
"blooms" rather than sheets.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.933
They're better suited
to the manufacture of rails.

31:35.102 --> 31:38.022
This house. I live in chaos.

31:38.022 --> 31:40.316
But not for much longer.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.360
I've prepared
our revised projections.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.988
If I secure the deal,
as I intend to,

31:45.988 --> 31:49.074
we should be profitable
in the second half of next year.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.037
Six months earlier
than anticipated.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.997
I've traveled 2,000 miles,
and I will not be put off!

31:56.999 --> 31:58.375
Please wait, <i>monsieur!</i>

31:58.375 --> 32:00.961
I am greatly impressed, Frederick.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.714
Well, I must say our success
has surpassed my expectations

32:03.714 --> 32:05.090
and has given me an appetite

32:05.090 --> 32:07.760
to look for schemes
on a similar scale,

32:07.760 --> 32:09.803
or larger, in fact.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.348
Of course.
You are a true entrepreneur.

32:12.348 --> 32:15.142
I doubt you will
ever be satisfied.

32:15.142 --> 32:18.354
I would always be open to
investment opportunities here...

32:18.354 --> 32:19.396
or abroad.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.982
Good. Yes.

32:21.982 --> 32:24.151
- <i>Madame!</i>
- Please...

32:24.151 --> 32:25.611
Non, <i>Monsieur</i> Bricus. Wait!

32:25.611 --> 32:27.154
<i>Mon dieu.</i> I'm so sorry.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.448
I will ask if
she will see you. Stop at once!

32:29.448 --> 32:30.658
Get your hands off of me!

32:32.076 --> 32:33.869
Mr. Bricus?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.996
What is wrong
with my money, huh? Huh?

32:35.996 --> 32:38.248
May I suggest you calm down?

32:38.248 --> 32:41.251
You came to me. You came to me
first with the silver mine,

32:41.251 --> 32:44.213
and now I am watching my friends
make money hand over fist--

32:44.213 --> 32:45.798
<i>friends</i> I sent to you.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.634
You need to stop shouting,
Mr. Bricus.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.010
What's wrong with my money?

32:50.010 --> 32:52.554
I am careful. That is all.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.474
I have a responsibility
to all my investors.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.893
In the meantime,
begging and shouting

32:57.893 --> 32:59.436
will not advance your cause.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.063
Wait.

33:06.151 --> 33:10.239
I am mortified.
Really, I am so embarrassed.

33:10.239 --> 33:12.282
Can I help?

33:12.282 --> 33:15.369
No. Thank you.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.955
<i>Madame</i> Fourcade
will show you out.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.318
- Hello.
- I'm afraid I'm busy.

33:51.155 --> 33:53.073
How was your day?

33:53.073 --> 33:56.201
It won't take long
to tell you about mine.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.163
I spent it alone,
with nothing to do.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.081
Forgive me,
this is urgent, so...

34:01.081 --> 34:04.501
More urgent than our marriage?

34:04.501 --> 34:06.253
Sorry.

34:12.634 --> 34:16.138
Did you need me for something?

34:16.138 --> 34:17.765
I was hoping
we might settle on a day

34:17.765 --> 34:20.309
to ask the Rochesters
to dine with us.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.060
Are we not lunching
with them tomorrow?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.520
Yes.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.231
But I would like
to be able to reciprocate.

34:26.231 --> 34:29.693
We've enjoyed a great deal
of their hospitality of late.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.111
We could invite
the Marquise as--

34:31.111 --> 34:34.114
I don't know. You may settle
on a date if you wish.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.324
How can I?

34:35.324 --> 34:37.743
How can I invite people here...

34:37.743 --> 34:41.330
or go anywhere or do anything
when we are like this?

34:41.330 --> 34:45.292
I can't solve this on my own.
You have to help me.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.668
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.671
I've told you what I feel,
that we need time.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.131
I'm asking nothing else of you.

34:51.131 --> 34:53.550
But I want you
to ask things of me.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.220
I need you to.

34:56.220 --> 34:58.305
Clara, I...

34:58.305 --> 34:59.598
Please...

35:01.308 --> 35:03.894
It has been a difficult day.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.979
I'm trying to deal
with something--

35:05.979 --> 35:07.147
Which you do not wish
to share with me.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.732
I have said
I will endeavor to forget.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.360
But you will shut me out.

35:11.360 --> 35:15.906
Have you once thought
of my feelings in all of this?

35:15.906 --> 35:17.366
Of what <i>I</i> am suffering?

35:17.366 --> 35:18.617
Yes...

35:18.617 --> 35:24.498
Perhaps...
you will not accept love

35:24.498 --> 35:28.794
from those who offer it,
who reach for you,

35:28.794 --> 35:30.546
because you choose not to.

35:32.673 --> 35:35.300
There's a selfishness in you

35:35.300 --> 35:37.177
which I didn't know was there.

36:02.870 --> 36:06.415
Is that me? Where's my nose?
May I have a nose...

36:09.793 --> 36:11.628
- And how's your Latin?
- Good.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.391
Oh, Your Grace...

36:24.391 --> 36:25.976
Is he awake?

36:25.976 --> 36:28.103
Yes, Your Grace.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.070
Well, well.

36:37.070 --> 36:40.240
Look at you.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.326
Sorry I haven't been in
to see you for a while.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.745
Fathers... eh?

36:49.374 --> 36:51.877
This is what
you enjoy reading, is it?

36:51.877 --> 36:56.840
<i>Marmaduke, The Tale
of a Mischievous Kitten.</i>

36:56.840 --> 36:58.717
"Mischievous"?

36:58.717 --> 37:00.510
Could be me.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.431
People tell me
I'm mischievous all the time.

37:04.431 --> 37:08.477
Though I think I'm more
of a big, sloppy dog.

37:08.477 --> 37:12.147
Don't you think?

37:12.147 --> 37:14.066
Shall we read it together?

37:27.788 --> 37:30.666
"Marmaduke,
the mischievous kitten,

37:30.666 --> 37:32.501
lay curled in a basket

37:32.501 --> 37:37.381
- with his..."
-"Brothers and sisters."

37:37.381 --> 37:41.468
"The kittens were white
with black patches,

37:41.468 --> 37:44.262
all except Marmaduke,
who was ..."

37:44.262 --> 37:46.682
"Orange."

37:46.682 --> 37:48.725
Orange?

37:48.725 --> 37:53.021
I don't think I've ever seen
an orange cat before. Have you?

38:00.070 --> 38:02.489
"All of the kittens were asleep,

38:02.489 --> 38:04.741
snoring little kitten snores.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.494
Dreaming little kitten dreams.

38:07.494 --> 38:08.996
And suddenly there was a..."

38:08.996 --> 38:10.580
"Thump."

38:10.580 --> 38:11.832
"...from down the hall..."

38:20.882 --> 38:23.552
- Will he sleep now?
- Oh, yes.

38:23.552 --> 38:26.138
Moorcroft and his bromide'll
see to that.

38:26.138 --> 38:30.559
He spends more time asleep
than he does awake.

38:30.559 --> 38:33.478
This is no life for him.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.814
He's so much more than this.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.067
Our beautiful boy.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.172
Your Ladyship?

39:00.172 --> 39:02.174
Are you quite certain of this?

39:04.468 --> 39:08.597
I'm sorry, but a public gallery
is one thing,

39:08.597 --> 39:11.850
but this is
a gentleman's private residence.

39:11.850 --> 39:16.938
But it is also a studio.
An atelier.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.607
And I'm not alone.
You're with me.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.585
Your Ladyship.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.629
Good heavens.
What an exquisite surprise.

39:40.629 --> 39:42.506
Uh...

39:42.506 --> 39:44.466
This is Minette.

39:44.466 --> 39:47.135
Come in. Come in, please.

39:48.136 --> 39:51.223
Oh, good girl, good girl.
Such a good girl.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.854
Minette is Annie's daughter.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.606
Ah.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.442
Did you meet Annie?
Perhaps not.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.444
You saw her in the painting.

40:04.444 --> 40:08.198
Your timing couldn't be better.
Richard's just in his studio.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.699
That's what I was
hoping to see.

40:09.699 --> 40:12.786
Of course.
Uh, Dearden? Visitors.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.372
Please, um, allow me
to take your coats.

40:22.963 --> 40:25.090
Right.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.724
Welcome, Your Ladyship.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.226
Thank you, Mr. Dearden.

40:36.226 --> 40:37.644
Richard, please.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.729
I'm grateful
for this opportunity.

40:39.729 --> 40:43.024
This is Miss Annie Harper.

40:43.024 --> 40:45.485
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

40:45.485 --> 40:46.653
I think I just met
your little girl.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.113
She's beautiful.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.116
Thank you.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.868
I can hardly
believe this place.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.411
I thought you'd like it.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.541
It's like a kind of alchemy.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.085
It is.

41:04.588 --> 41:06.965
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

41:09.134 --> 41:13.263
Dido, Queen of Carthage.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.724
It's enchanting.

41:15.724 --> 41:17.726
It's far from finished.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.311
He doesn't know
how to take a compliment.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.566
- And this...
- Months of work.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.360
I'm still
searching for my Perdita,

41:27.360 --> 41:29.154
which is a little ironic.

41:29.154 --> 41:33.325
I don't suppose
you'd oblige, m'lady?

41:33.325 --> 41:35.577
There's an idea.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.412
Sorry...

41:37.412 --> 41:41.166
Only I thought it in the gallery
as soon as I saw you.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.545
Thank you. I think not.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.422
The search continues.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.636
Would you like to?

41:52.636 --> 41:53.762
I daren't.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.514
I can always paint over it.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.350
The slightest touch.

42:12.656 --> 42:16.034
Now you're an artist.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.745
We're gonna
have something to eat.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.914
Some friends are joining us.

42:20.914 --> 42:22.040
I hope you'll stay.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.583
You should.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.335
Two of them
are just back from Paris.

42:25.335 --> 42:27.337
There'll be tales to tell.

42:27.337 --> 42:29.756
You have your engagement,
Your Ladyship.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.393
Thank you.

42:41.393 --> 42:44.354
We shall be leaving
for the Rochesters' soon.

42:44.354 --> 42:45.772
We shan't have need
of the carriage.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.190
Very good, Your Lordship.

42:47.190 --> 42:52.737
I believe Her Ladyship is out,
Your Lordship.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.699
I daresay she intends
to return in time.

42:55.699 --> 42:57.867
Uh, yes. I believe
she did mention something.

42:57.867 --> 43:01.288
- Thank you.
- Your Lordship.

43:26.396 --> 43:27.814
I'm afraid Clara
has been detained

43:27.814 --> 43:29.065
at a previous appointment.

43:29.065 --> 43:31.401
Yes, her maid
just brought word.

43:31.401 --> 43:34.070
I'm... really very sorry, Duchess.

43:34.070 --> 43:37.699
Please don't worry. We shall be
perfectly satisfied with you.

43:43.788 --> 43:44.914
We have guests!

43:44.914 --> 43:46.875
- Finally.
- Olive!

43:46.875 --> 43:48.084
Off the boat from France.

43:48.084 --> 43:51.546
- How do you do?
- Olive.

43:51.546 --> 43:52.672
How are you, Olive?

43:52.672 --> 43:54.507
Lady Trenchard, this is Theo.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.843
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Theo, pleasure to meet you.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.012
- Archibald.
- How are you?

43:59.012 --> 44:01.639
Oh, I'm afraid I shan't remember
all these names.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.308
Please don't worry
about that, Your Ladyship.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.643
He can't remember his name
half the time.

44:16.071 --> 44:18.698
Tell us about France.
Tell us about Paris.

44:18.698 --> 44:20.492
Tell us about
the revolution.

44:20.492 --> 44:21.868
Oh, it's a beautiful
new world.

44:21.868 --> 44:24.245
We've got muskets
and barricades.

I shall put you in the seat for
monarchs, deans, and bishops.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.995
First, I thank my God

45:46.995 --> 45:49.789
<i>through Jesus Christ
for you all,</i>

45:49.789 --> 45:53.460
that your faith is spoken of

For God is my witness,

whom I serve with my spirit
in the gospel of His son...

45:58.673 --> 46:01.009

46:01.009 --> 46:04.179
I make a mention of you

46:04.179 --> 46:09.225
Making request,
if by any means now at length,

46:09.225 --> 46:11.853
I might have
a prosperous journey

46:11.853 --> 46:14.647
by the will of God,
to come unto you...
