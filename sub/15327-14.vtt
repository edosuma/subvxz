- Hey, Dad, can you
give me some stamps?

00:04.629 --> 00:06.005
- How many?

00:06.089 --> 00:07.757
- Enough to mail
something about...

00:07.841 --> 00:09.050
71 pounds.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.261
According to my doctor.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.930
- We talked about
this the last time.

00:14.013 --> 00:17.600
We go to Hawaii
as a family or not at all.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.353
- I'm sending myself to
my best friend--Brody.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.439
He moved away and I'm
gonna surprise him.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.899
- Brody moved?
Aw, I'm so sorry.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.570
- Are you sorry enough to front
me some of those cookies?

00:28.653 --> 00:32.198
Because I can be in here
for a couple of days.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.033
- Sweetie, those cookies
are for my meeting.

00:34.117 --> 00:37.912
- Yeah, because that's the part
of this you need to address.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.749
Nobody is shipping
themselves anywhere.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.959
- I have a better idea anyway.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.295
My client has
a son about your age,

00:45.378 --> 00:47.255
and maybe you can
make a new friend.

00:47.338 --> 00:50.383
- Hmmmm...is this kid
into video games?

00:50.467 --> 00:52.135
- I don't know.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.137
- I sorta need him to be
into video games.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.765
Does he like popsicles?
- Probably.

00:56.848 --> 01:00.393
- I sorta need him
to like popsicles.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.896
Does he like
knock-knock jokes?

01:02.979 --> 01:04.230
- [groans]
Absolutely.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.815
Fine. He loves
knock-knock jokes.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.484
Tells them all the time.

- What is he--
a grandpa?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.820
Pass!

01:10.904 --> 01:12.989
- Okay, Aaron, I found a good
shipping company,

01:13.072 --> 01:15.492
and I put your down
as "perishable."

01:15.575 --> 01:17.285

Apocalypse huge?

{\an8}- Why are those
my only two options?

02:18.638 --> 02:20.723
{\an8}If I do well with
her diabetes fundraiser,

02:20.807 --> 02:23.143
{\an8}I can end up with asthma
and that can lead to lupus

02:23.226 --> 02:27.230
{\an8}and even lyme disease and
I really want lyme disease.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.441
{\an8}- All right, if it's
that important to you,

02:30.525 --> 02:32.110
{\an8}I'll play with the kid.

{\an8}- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.621
{\an8}- Come on in.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.456
- Thank you so much
for having us over.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.042
You must be Aaron.
Aaron, this is Justin.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.754
Justin, say "Hi."

02:51.838 --> 02:53.423
- Got any good toys?

02:53.506 --> 02:55.550
I sorta need you
to have good toys.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.346
- This is even cooler
than the stuff

03:00.430 --> 03:02.098
Brody and I used to build.

03:02.181 --> 03:05.101
- The real fun's
knocking it down.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.109
- Do you wanna
talk about it?

03:13.192 --> 03:14.193
- Hey, I know what
we can do now.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.115
- Uh, Justin, we're not allowed
to jump on the beds.

03:19.198 --> 03:25.288
- This...is...so...
much...fun!

03:25.371 --> 03:30.585
- You...are...so...

03:30.668 --> 03:32.337
- Woo!

03:32.420 --> 03:36.299
Man, I worked
up an appetite.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.134
- Where's you get
those cookies?

03:38.217 --> 03:39.636
- From your kitchen.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.721
- But Stephanie said
not before lunch.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.641
- [mocking] But Stephanie
said not before lunch!

03:44.724 --> 03:46.809
Justin says--who cares?

03:46.893 --> 03:49.896
Go ahead. I won't tell.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.149
- It must be after
lunch somewhere.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.027
- I know--let's go online

03:56.110 --> 03:58.821
and watch Vice Squad
Undercover.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.865
- Stephanie says
I can't watch that.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.660
- And what did Justin say about
what Stephanie says?

04:03.743 --> 04:06.829
- Dude, you're
blowing my mind.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.665
But I don't
have a laptop.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.667
- We'll just watch
on this phone.

04:10.750 --> 04:15.004
- You have your own phone?
- I have somebody's phone.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.173
- Well, I have always wondered
what a vice squad is

04:18.257 --> 04:21.052
and what it does
under the covers.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.013
- You're not allowed to watch
Vice Squad Undercover!

04:24.097 --> 04:27.308
- Keep your mouth shut and
there's a twenty in it for you.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.186
My mom has a bunch
in her wallet.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.689
- I like the cut of
your jib, Justin.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.358
- Oh, Laser Tag!

04:35.441 --> 04:37.944
Let's use this and play
Vice Squad Undercover.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.698
You be the perp
and resist arrest.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.159
- No, no, no. Keep your
jib away from my lasers.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.542
- Wanna watch the show?
- Forget the show.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.876
I wanna play Laser Tag.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.045
- Didn't you hear James?
He said no.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.381
- I just heard
you say no.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.092
- Whoa, man,
personal space.

05:01.175 --> 05:05.013
- Nobody tells me no.
I hate that word!

05:05.096 --> 05:06.973
If I were you, I would
never say that word

05:07.056 --> 05:09.350
ever to me again!

05:09.434 --> 05:12.729
- Uh, then, how about
I say sorry

05:12.812 --> 05:15.732
and let's play
us some Laser Tag.

05:30.329 --> 05:31.414
- It's up!

05:31.497 --> 05:33.499
He thinks it might
be anxiety.

But of course
I'm anxious!

05:35.209 --> 05:37.754
I've got blood pressure!

- You should exercise
and eat healthier.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.508
Do you want me to mix
you up a smoothie?

05:42.592 --> 05:44.594

puttin' in it?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.262
- Fruit, vegetables.
Mostly seaweed.

Come on, try some.

I get anywhere
near seaweed,

05:54.020 --> 05:57.231
and I'm six feet under.

how do you go to the beach?

Oh, but I would like
some of these.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.790

Justin with her.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.308

- Well, just tell Stephanie you
don't wanna hang out with him.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.814
- I can't. She's doing all this
business with his mom.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.734
So I have to protect
myself any way I can.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.696

pop that bubble wrap.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.115

I'll tell her.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.784

We'll set up another play
date soon. Don't worry.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.217

You see, Stephanie,
the thing about Justin is--

07:50.469 --> 07:52.054
- What's up with your Mom?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.264
She won't return
any of my calls.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.392
I almost let her choke
to death one time

07:56.475 --> 07:58.227

a smoothie.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.146
Yeah, I'm hearin' it.

Oh, and I might be able to get
you heart disease, too.
