WEBVTT

00:57.099 --> 01:01.144
Earth, birthplace of the human race,

01:02.521 --> 01:05.397
a species much like our own,

01:06.233 --> 01:08.901
capable of great compassion

01:10.654 --> 01:12.655
and great violence.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.753
For in our quest to protect the humans,

01:26.837 --> 01:29.839
a deeper revelation dawns.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.134
Our worlds have met before.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.891
-Newsflash from the BBC.
-Breaking news out of Shanghai.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.020
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.231
We're staying
on top of this developing story for you.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.776
We will bring you
any new information as we get it.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.158
NEST Seahawks approaching target.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.495
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.666
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.751
All right, give NEST team the go.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.628
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.966
Ding-a-ling!
Come out and get your ice cream.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.556
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.857
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

03:10.941 --> 03:14.235
has taken refuge here
under my command.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.153
Arcees, get ready to launch.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.738
We're locked and loaded.

03:17.823 --> 03:21.868
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

03:21.952 --> 03:25.162
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.

03:25.247 --> 03:28.165
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is "toxic spill."

03:28.250 --> 03:30.501
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.045
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.340
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.636
A classified strike team called NEST.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.348
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

03:44.433 --> 03:47.435
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.853
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.114
Move out! Let's go!

04:17.632 --> 04:21.719
All right, lronhide.
We got echoes. They're close.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.722
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

04:36.026 --> 04:39.487
He's here. l smell him.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.993
lt's close. lt's getting closer.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.167
-Oh, no.
-What have you got?

04:53.877 --> 04:55.503
Thermal ripple.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.508
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.397
Eagle niner!

05:14.481 --> 05:16.190
l need an energy proton.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.873
Panther 1 , requesting fire mission now!

05:33.500 --> 05:35.376
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!

05:35.460 --> 05:37.253
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.805
We got a second Decepticon.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.686
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!

05:58.400 --> 06:00.151
l got him, l got him!

06:30.182 --> 06:33.225
l screwed that up. l'm okay. l'm all right.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.478
-This is combat, man.
-Total brain freeze, man.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.645
What's wrong with you?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.109
Bring in Sideswipe!

06:43.904 --> 06:45.488
Clear a path!

07:01.338 --> 07:02.671
Damn, l'm good!

07:12.099 --> 07:15.434
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

07:15.519 --> 07:17.937
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.

07:18.021 --> 07:22.274
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.624
Autobots, l'm in pursuit!

08:07.404 --> 08:08.779
Pull over!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.844
Punk-ass Decepticon!

08:31.928 --> 08:34.263
Any last words?

08:34.347 --> 08:38.058
This is not your planet to rule!

08:38.143 --> 08:40.477
The Fallen shall rise again.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.647
That doesn't sound good.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.858
Not today.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.490
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!

08:53.575 --> 08:56.368
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.913
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

08:58.997 --> 09:01.624
-Did you rent the room out?
-No, l got other ideas for your room

09:01.708 --> 09:03.876
and it rhymes with "home theater."

09:09.049 --> 09:12.760
Look what l found.
lt's your little baby booties.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.223
-Ma.
-My little baby-bootie boy.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.099
-You can't go.
-You see this, Dad? This is how

09:19.184 --> 09:20.559
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

09:20.644 --> 09:22.895
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

09:22.979 --> 09:25.439
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

09:25.523 --> 09:29.568
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.612
You have to come home for Halloween.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.947
Well, l can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.448
-Well, then we'll come to you.
-You're not coming.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.699
-No, we're not going anywhere.
-We'll dress up.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.076
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.744
-You can't do that, Mom.
-Would you let the kid breathe,

09:38.828 --> 09:40.621
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.248
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.584
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.420
-Dad.
-l love it when you call me "young lady,"

09:48.505 --> 09:50.547
-you dirty old man.
-You ain't seen nothing yet.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.675
-Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
-What?

09:52.759 --> 09:55.135
l'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
lt's not a rap video.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.553
lt's just like a coach thing.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.514
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.

09:58.598 --> 10:03.727
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.272
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.984
Now l'm crying again! This sucks!

10:10.068 --> 10:11.860
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.404
You know, it's just going to be,

10:13.488 --> 10:19.285
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

10:19.369 --> 10:22.288
going out to handle the world
on his own.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.623
-You okay, Pop?
-Yeah.

10:24.708 --> 10:27.293
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

10:27.377 --> 10:30.671
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.798
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.051
-What are you talking about, Dad?
-There's gonna be a lot of women there.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.803
Yeah, well,
l'm a one-woman kind of guy.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.221
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

10:39.306 --> 10:41.932
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

10:42.017 --> 10:44.268
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.520
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.022
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?

10:58.908 --> 11:02.036
Dad, listen, l know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.997
Wait a second. Who could that be?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.874
ln two weeks, it could be Muffy.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.208
Hey, beautiful.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.544
-l'm breaking up with you, Sam.
-Really?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.087
You sure?
l'm not hearing a lot of conviction.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.758
Well, l am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.093
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

11:18.762 --> 11:22.014
Guess what? l made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.516
Yeah, l got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.768
All Witwicky, all the time.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.853
And l got you a couple souvenirs
from the event

11:27.937 --> 11:29.188
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.775
-Some mixes and candles and stuff.
-Sounds cute. l can't wait.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.194
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.446
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.031
Yeah. Of course, l kept it, Mikaela.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.158
lt's like my Super Bowl jersey.
l bled in this thing.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.869
-Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
-No, it's not that.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.372
lt's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.708
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

11:50.293 --> 11:51.335
You really should come with me.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.170
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.799
Well, that's not gonna happen
until l get my man-child father,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.551
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.929
l heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

12:02.013 --> 12:04.390
-Next to the camshafts.
-l love it when you say "camshafts."

12:04.474 --> 12:05.516
Whisper it to me.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.853
Camshafts.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.022
Why can't l hate you?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.942
lt's my Witwicky charm.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.735
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.738
l guess we're not breaking up.
l'll be over in 20.

12:19.823 --> 12:23.492
Mikaela, l think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.040
Sam?

12:38.133 --> 12:39.174
There's a fire!

12:39.592 --> 12:41.427
Dad, we got a fire!

13:00.280 --> 13:01.488
Fire!

13:11.541 --> 13:14.168
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?

13:14.252 --> 13:15.794
Can you just stop?

13:15.879 --> 13:18.589
Yeah, okay, l'll stop. You carry this shit!

13:28.975 --> 13:30.225
-Wow.
-Do you know what?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.560
-What?
-l don't want to go anywhere with you.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.811
l don't wanna go to France with you.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.438
l don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.814
-l'm going back inside.
-All right, fine.

13:35.899 --> 13:36.940
l'll call you from Paris.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.829
What is all the racket?

13:50.914 --> 13:51.914
Sam?

13:52.582 --> 13:54.374
Dad!

13:59.923 --> 14:01.840
-What was that?
-That's the whole kitchen!

14:04.677 --> 14:07.429
-Bumblebee... Oh, my...
-Bumblebee!

14:26.824 --> 14:29.868
-91 1 .
-Bumblebee!

14:30.620 --> 14:32.871
-Get in the garage. Go!
-What the freak just happened?

14:32.956 --> 14:37.209
l'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.794
Holy Mother!

14:41.756 --> 14:44.800
-Oh, my God!
-Whatever.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.052
Get in the garage now!

14:52.809 --> 14:55.227
-Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
-Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

14:55.311 --> 14:59.022
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

15:04.696 --> 15:06.697
My house is on fire!

15:10.159 --> 15:12.202
-...very important.
-What happened?

15:12.287 --> 15:16.999
Come here. Listen, l need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.250
-What's going on?
-Just take it.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.252
-Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
-Yes, Mom. Yeah.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.504
-Hi, Mikaela. l have a bald spot.
-Hi.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.965
-An old furnace, l think.
-From a waffle iron.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.594
When you go, he goes. l cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

15:28.678 --> 15:31.346
Judy... National security.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.975
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.395
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?

15:38.479 --> 15:41.523
Fine. lf the government's paying,
l want a pool and a hot tub!

15:41.608 --> 15:44.067
And l'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

15:47.864 --> 15:51.283
-Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
-He still having voice problems?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.785
He's playing it up.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.955
Bee, l want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.292
l'm so excited and l just can't hide it

16:00.376 --> 16:02.502
Hey, l'm not taking you with me.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.340
l'm gonna wait outside, okay?

16:08.009 --> 16:09.176
l meant to tell you about this earlier.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.720
lt's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.014
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.100
l know, and if it was up to me,
l'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.978
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

16:20.063 --> 16:24.441
l mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.984
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.445
Can you just look at me, please?

16:29.739 --> 16:32.908
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.328
Okay? You did yourjob.
Look, l'm safe now.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.872
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

16:38.956 --> 16:42.334
l just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why l'm going to college,

16:42.418 --> 16:44.586
and l can't do that with you.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.506
lt's not the last time l'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

16:47.590 --> 16:51.385
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.597
But you'll always be my first car.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.142
Love you, Bee.

17:04.898 --> 17:05.982
Wow!

17:06.192 --> 17:09.236
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.820
-You got dirt all over you.
-Stop. Stop.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.406
-What?
-Stop, l'm okay.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.865
Look.

17:14.325 --> 17:17.202
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.538
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.624
-And?
-And l'll do anything for you.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.542
And?

17:24.627 --> 17:27.713
-l think Sam's about to say the L-word.
-Let's go, kiddo!

17:27.797 --> 17:28.880
Nice timing, Dad.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.966
l adore you.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.385
That's not the word that l want

17:33.469 --> 17:34.886
-to hear right now.
-What are you talking about?

17:34.971 --> 17:35.971
lt's the same word as the other word.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.889
-lt's not the same word.
-Look, if l say the other word now

17:37.974 --> 17:39.516
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

17:39.600 --> 17:41.852
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.521
Yeah, but l haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

17:44.605 --> 17:48.233
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.

17:48.317 --> 17:52.487
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

17:53.281 --> 17:56.158
-lt can be.
-l hate that it's working.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.994
Can l have a kiss?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.830
We're going to make it work, l promise.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.950
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.036
Retrieve it.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.602
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.522
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.482
-Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
-No, l don't...

19:10.566 --> 19:11.691
-Hold up.
-Those are nice.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.401
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.155
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

19:17.240 --> 19:21.117
-Time to get my sexy on with the green.
-Green? No, green is mine!

19:21.202 --> 19:22.577
l call green!

19:25.581 --> 19:27.040
-l got the green.
-That hurt, man.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.292
lt's supposed to hurt. lt's an ass-kicking.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.763
Present arms!

19:56.112 --> 19:58.530
Director Galloway, what an honor.
l'd love to show you around,

19:58.614 --> 20:00.115
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.784
l am now. Presidential order, Major.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.787
l got a message
for your classified space buddies!

20:05.872 --> 20:07.956
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.337
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

20:14.422 --> 20:17.591
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.970
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.662
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.749
-General?
-Will, I saw the Shanghai op.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.335
-We had a rough day out there.
-Yes, sir.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.296
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.590
Now with your permission,
l can't let you see him,

20:58.674 --> 21:01.051
but l would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

21:01.135 --> 21:02.177
Proceed.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.447
You gotta wonder,

21:22.531 --> 21:25.867
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

21:27.036 --> 21:29.245
General, our alliance
has countermanded

21:29.330 --> 21:31.957
six Decepticon incursions this year,

21:32.041 --> 21:34.626
each on a different continent.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.629
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

21:37.713 --> 21:41.091
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.843
"The Fallen shall rise again."

21:43.928 --> 21:46.221
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

21:46.305 --> 21:49.724
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race

21:49.809 --> 21:53.979
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.647
Excuse me!

21:56.440 --> 22:00.986
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,

22:01.070 --> 22:04.614
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

22:04.699 --> 22:06.992
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.036
The Presidentjust appointed him liaison.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.706
Well, l guess l didn't get that memo.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.794
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.255
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.550
After all the damage in Shanghai,

22:23.634 --> 22:27.595
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

22:28.931 --> 22:33.893
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

22:33.978 --> 22:39.524
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

22:39.608 --> 22:43.528
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

22:43.612 --> 22:47.198
lt would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.160
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

22:50.244 --> 22:52.287
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

22:52.371 --> 22:53.913
in the field for two years.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.292
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.086
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.796
Don't tempt me.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.382
And the newest members of your team.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.760
-Easy.
-l understand they arrived here

23:06.844 --> 23:08.720
after you sent a message into space,

23:08.804 --> 23:12.557
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.394
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. lt was vetted right here.

23:16.479 --> 23:20.398
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team

23:20.483 --> 23:23.401
has always been above reproach.

23:23.486 --> 23:26.321
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

23:26.405 --> 23:31.951
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.

23:32.661 --> 23:35.163
Now, what do we know so far?

23:35.831 --> 23:41.669
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

23:41.754 --> 23:45.340
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

23:45.424 --> 23:49.928
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

23:50.012 --> 23:54.432
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

23:54.517 --> 23:56.434
is locked in an electromagnetic vault

23:56.519 --> 23:59.854
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the worId.

24:01.065 --> 24:04.442
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

24:04.527 --> 24:10.365
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

24:10.449 --> 24:13.284
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

24:13.369 --> 24:16.204
You! The Autobots!

24:17.039 --> 24:19.332
They're here to hunt you!

24:19.959 --> 24:22.377
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

24:22.461 --> 24:25.338
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

24:25.422 --> 24:27.632
lt sounds to me
like something's coming.

24:27.716 --> 24:32.470
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

24:32.555 --> 24:36.266
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

24:38.352 --> 24:41.271
will you leave peacefully?

24:41.355 --> 24:46.234
Freedom is your right. lf you make
that request, we will honor it.

24:47.444 --> 24:52.574
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

24:53.033 --> 24:57.537
What if we leave and you're wrong?

25:05.087 --> 25:07.088
That's a good question.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.720
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

25:14.555 --> 25:16.848
l feel smarter already.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.811
-Ron, can you smell it?
-Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

25:21.896 --> 25:26.399
-Hey, cheapo!
-Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.525
Just go ahead and check out your room.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.610
Yeah, go.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.203
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.206
-You must be Sam, right? l'm Leo.
-Hey.

25:42.249 --> 25:45.793
So, l already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

25:46.629 --> 25:49.380
-That side.
-l already chose that side.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.760
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.428
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if l'm a normal guy.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.804
l'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.431
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.891
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.017
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.644
-lncluding girlfriends.
-Especially girlfriends.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.979
-You got a girlfriend?
-l do. You?

26:05.814 --> 26:08.441
No, not a chance. You a techie?

26:08.525 --> 26:10.735
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

26:10.819 --> 26:13.071
-Server's almost online, Leo.
-Network's up and running.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.572
Beautiful, that's what l like to hear.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.659
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my lT gurus.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.870
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal.com.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.205
That's me, l'm sure you've heard of it.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.707
-No, l haven't.
-Well, that sucks.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.251
-What is all this for?
-See where l'm going, bro.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.254
Look, call me gross,
l want to be a baby billionaire.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.839
Kitten calendars.
That's where l started. Look at me now.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.174
Got to have dreams, bro.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.929
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!

26:38.013 --> 26:40.974
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

26:41.058 --> 26:43.434
-What's "FTJ"?
-"Fuel the Jet."

26:43.519 --> 26:44.852
Fuel the Jet, bro.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.313
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

26:48.607 --> 26:49.774
Did you see that? Did you see that?

26:49.858 --> 26:52.318
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

26:52.403 --> 26:54.779
Don't believe the hype, bro.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.491
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.952
Yeah, l saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

27:01.036 --> 27:03.288
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

27:03.372 --> 27:05.331
-lt looks fake to me.
-Dude, it's not fake.

27:05.416 --> 27:08.501
The lnternet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.211
-lt looks fake.
-No, man, l've seen them.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.506
-They're, like, these robots...
-Look, look, it's fake.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.091
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.218
And l wasn't there,

27:17.303 --> 27:19.512
-so l can't comment or speculate.
-No.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.806
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

27:21.890 --> 27:24.851
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

27:24.935 --> 27:26.644
-Which sack?
-The ball sack.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.271
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

27:28.355 --> 27:31.357
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

27:31.442 --> 27:33.818
-lt's aliens, man.
-Okay, okay.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.153
Follow me.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.238
Leo, bad news!

27:37.323 --> 27:39.657
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.242
Fassbinder!

27:42.411 --> 27:44.662
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.789
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

27:46.874 --> 27:49.375
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.836
By the way, l read your file.
l'm poor, you're poor.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.089
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.509
l work for you now? That's incredible.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.512
lt's first day of college,
l got a career in a dinky lnternet firm

28:01.597 --> 28:04.640
with a boss who is made up
ofjust pure champion stuff.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.684
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

28:06.769 --> 28:08.311
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me

28:08.395 --> 28:10.021
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause l'll do it!

28:10.105 --> 28:13.358
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can l switch out?

28:13.442 --> 28:18.321
Sad face, 31 2. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

28:18.405 --> 28:19.489
-Oh, here we go.
-We made it. Hi.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.698
lt's just like Hogwarts.

28:20.783 --> 28:21.991
-Hi.
-ls this co-ed?

28:22.076 --> 28:23.368
This is a co-ed dorm.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.911
-You guys want to meet my roommates?
-Yeah.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.245
Some real swell guys.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.705
-Here's Leo.
-We're the Witwickys.

28:27.790 --> 28:28.873
-l'm Leo.
-l'm Judy.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.750
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.378
-Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
-Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.629
What is that in your hand, by the way?

28:34.713 --> 28:38.800
l got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.803
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.429
-Mom?
-Yeah, it's 1 00% pure,

28:43.514 --> 28:45.139
Hawaiian green for the environment.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.724
-How many of these have you eaten?
-Drop it.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.726
-What is this?
-Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.186
-No, it's...
-Please, give me...

28:50.270 --> 28:52.397
Hey! lt's my cheat day.
l can eat what l want.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.399
l'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.691
Please do something right now.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.319
l can eat all the fricking brownies l want!

28:58.404 --> 28:59.445
Come on, let's go.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.030
l'm sorry and you're welcome.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.952
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."

29:06.036 --> 29:08.996
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.499
ls... ls so nice...

29:12.459 --> 29:15.962
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.632
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.426
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?

29:21.885 --> 29:25.763
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.016
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.435
Glad she ain't my mama!

29:30.519 --> 29:32.728
And he recently had his cherry popped!

29:34.231 --> 29:36.107
He didn't know l was in the house!
l heard it all!

29:36.191 --> 29:37.859
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Here he is!

29:38.444 --> 29:41.487
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

29:41.572 --> 29:47.452
-Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
-No, like the GPS. OnStar!

29:47.911 --> 29:49.370
-OnStar.
-Frisbee!

29:50.456 --> 29:53.499
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

29:57.880 --> 30:01.299
-Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
-Hey! Crazy!

30:01.383 --> 30:03.551
-You want it?
-l want it.

30:03.635 --> 30:07.054
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.515
-You gotta control your mother.
-l don't know who this woman is.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.143
Hey, Professor, l'd do anything for an A.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.104
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

30:15.189 --> 30:18.065
-Did you get the booties? All right.
-Yes, Dad, l got the booties!

30:18.567 --> 30:19.942
l'm upside down!

30:51.808 --> 30:53.518
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

30:53.602 --> 30:57.438
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.433
Breach at B-14.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.689
Go, go, go, go!

32:29.948 --> 32:31.699
The shard's gone.

32:40.417 --> 32:41.667
Contact!

32:42.544 --> 32:44.045
Take it down!

32:44.838 --> 32:46.297
-Which way?
-Shoot left!

32:51.887 --> 32:53.471
Knock it down!

33:02.689 --> 33:05.316
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.068
So, get your game faces on.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.278
l can't stay long.
l have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

33:09.363 --> 33:10.571
-That's so cool!
-No, it's not.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.579
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

33:18.664 --> 33:20.539
l'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.833
-Let's roll.
-She's hot.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.752
Bro, we're hunting!

33:27.923 --> 33:30.132
-See you, darling.
-Bye, Dad.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.301
Okay.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.601
This is our first live chat date.
l've never done it before.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.978
l'm kind of nervous.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.799
-Are you okay?
-No.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.553
l was getting a napkin for my drink.

34:16.513 --> 34:18.973
Thanks. Cheers.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.058
-lt's Sam, right?
-Yeah.

34:21.143 --> 34:24.812
-l wanna dance.
-What, like... Like dancing?

34:25.647 --> 34:27.982
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

34:28.065 --> 34:32.862
'Cause l'm in a permanently semi...
l'm in a relationship, kind of...

34:33.447 --> 34:37.283
-Relax. l just want to have some fun.
-Wanna have some fun?

34:37.367 --> 34:41.370
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

34:43.290 --> 34:44.331
Oh, my...

34:44.416 --> 34:48.043
So, how about tonight
you pretend l'm your girlfriend

34:48.128 --> 34:50.254
and l pretend that you're my boyfriend?

35:00.056 --> 35:03.517
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.937
There is a car on the lawn!

35:10.817 --> 35:11.942
What are you doing?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.527
Houston, we have a problem.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.695
-What is it?
-Freshman!

35:14.780 --> 35:16.280
-Yeah?
-ls that your car in our bushes?

35:16.364 --> 35:20.242
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.037
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.747
Now how about
l park my foot in your ass?

35:24.831 --> 35:26.457
-What size shoe do you wear?
-Yeah?

35:26.541 --> 35:28.542
-Hold on.
-You wanna try?

35:28.627 --> 35:31.462
-l'll back it up right now.
-Get him out of here.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.298
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

35:34.382 --> 35:35.466
l've only known you 1 7 hours.

35:35.550 --> 35:39.053
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

35:39.137 --> 35:43.349
-l love Camaros.
-l can't do this right now, okay?

35:43.433 --> 35:45.351
-Don't be a wimp.
-Oh, God!

35:53.735 --> 35:57.988
-My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
-Yeah?

35:58.073 --> 36:02.827
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.205
We shouldn't stare...

36:06.289 --> 36:09.792
l mean, share stories
with each other at all.

36:09.876 --> 36:12.169
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.755
Your cheatin' heart

36:18.844 --> 36:20.010
Don't. Don't!

36:20.095 --> 36:22.847
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky

36:22.931 --> 36:26.058
-ls your radio broken?
-No, my concentration is.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.935
We're not cheating.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.563
Not yet.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.901
ls something wrong here?

36:40.282 --> 36:42.074
God! You okay?

36:44.619 --> 36:46.036
She's mighty, mighty

36:46.121 --> 36:49.415
l really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

36:55.547 --> 36:57.631
Oh, God! lt's in my mouth!

36:58.091 --> 37:00.050
Are you okay? l got Wetnaps.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.511
l got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!

37:02.596 --> 37:04.680
l... l'm so sorry!

37:06.474 --> 37:07.516
What are you doing?

37:20.447 --> 37:22.531
You won't give me a day, huh?

37:23.158 --> 37:26.410
-You won't give me one day in college?
-l'm sorry, Sam,

37:26.494 --> 37:29.830
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.749
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

37:31.833 --> 37:35.878
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

37:35.962 --> 37:38.756
but l'm here for your help, Sam,

37:38.840 --> 37:43.260
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.346
Perhaps they are right.

37:45.430 --> 37:50.517
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.312
-This isn't my war.
-Not yet,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.774
but l fear it soon will be.

37:56.858 --> 38:00.402
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.656
Whole generations lost.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.537
l know, and l want to help you, l do,

38:10.622 --> 38:13.707
but l am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

38:13.792 --> 38:15.584
l'm a normal kid with normal problems.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.046
l am where l'm supposed to be.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.384
l'm sorry. l...

38:25.053 --> 38:26.136
l really am.

38:26.221 --> 38:30.057
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

38:30.850 --> 38:33.686
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.940
We do, more than you know.

39:11.182 --> 39:15.561
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

39:15.645 --> 39:17.646
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

39:17.731 --> 39:20.441
-What do you got?
-SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

39:20.525 --> 39:21.734
diving fast.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.032
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.618
-Man battle stations.
-Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

39:31.703 --> 39:33.579
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.373
-Left full rudder, two-thirds.
-Dive, go deep.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.773
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.

40:00.857 --> 40:04.735
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

40:04.819 --> 40:06.987
-None, sir.
-Then, people, we've got a problem!

40:17.123 --> 40:21.293
Need parts! Kill the little one!

40:28.760 --> 40:30.886
The shard make Energon!

40:43.691 --> 40:47.069
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

40:47.153 --> 40:49.530
-Sound collision alarm.
-Left hard rudder.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.366
Five hundred feet.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.369
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.587
-Collision imminent port side.
-One hundred feet.

41:05.672 --> 41:06.713
Brace for impact.

41:33.283 --> 41:36.285
Starscream, l'm home.

41:36.369 --> 41:41.456
Lord Megatron, l was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

41:41.541 --> 41:45.711
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

41:45.795 --> 41:50.674
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

41:50.758 --> 41:55.095
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.392
-So disappointing.
-Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

42:00.476 --> 42:04.605
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

42:10.403 --> 42:13.989
My master, l failed you on Earth.

42:14.073 --> 42:19.703
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

42:20.580 --> 42:26.168
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

42:26.252 --> 42:29.880
lts power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

42:29.964 --> 42:34.551
-lt can only transform.
-How is that possible?

42:34.636 --> 42:38.222
lt has been absorbed
by the human child.

42:38.306 --> 42:43.352
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

42:43.436 --> 42:47.064
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

42:47.148 --> 42:50.609
And you will, my apprentice, in time.

42:50.693 --> 42:55.989
For millennia, l have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

42:56.074 --> 43:02.663
where l, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes l called my brothers.

43:03.498 --> 43:10.337
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

43:10.672 --> 43:14.049
Optimus! He protects the boy.

43:14.133 --> 43:17.427
Then the boy will lead us to him

43:17.512 --> 43:23.016
-and revenge will be ours.
-Yes.

43:24.018 --> 43:28.188
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

43:29.357 --> 43:33.318
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

43:38.783 --> 43:43.120
Space. Time. Gravity.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.127
-Thank you.
-Finish that for me.

43:50.211 --> 43:53.088
We're going on a journey together,
you and l, today.

43:53.172 --> 43:58.176
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

43:59.012 --> 44:02.014
And l shall be your consort, your guide,

44:02.098 --> 44:06.101
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

44:08.688 --> 44:10.939
Welcome to Astronomy 1 01 .

44:12.150 --> 44:15.569
For what do we know about the stars?

44:16.112 --> 44:19.531
Virgo, the virgin.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.534
Orion, the great hunter.

44:22.618 --> 44:27.247
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.666
No, they are dynamos

44:29.751 --> 44:34.338
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

44:34.422 --> 44:40.135
Behold the work ofAlbert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.678
-Energy equals mass...
-What you doing?

44:41.763 --> 44:43.221
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.724
Young man, there are no questions

44:45.808 --> 44:47.768
until l've reached
the climax of my lecture.

44:47.852 --> 44:51.188
l just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.273
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

44:53.358 --> 44:54.441
of light squared in this dimension,

44:54.525 --> 44:57.486
but what about the other 1 7?
Nobody ever talks about the other 1 7.

44:58.112 --> 44:59.780
Clear example.

45:03.493 --> 45:04.826
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

45:04.911 --> 45:07.371
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

45:07.455 --> 45:08.872
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

45:08.956 --> 45:12.584
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,

45:12.668 --> 45:14.628
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

45:14.712 --> 45:16.129
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.507
Come on, guys, l can't be
the only one in the class who...

45:18.591 --> 45:23.345
Young man, l will not be
punk'd in front of the dean.

45:24.722 --> 45:28.100
No, this is my universe here.

45:28.184 --> 45:33.563
Do you understand?
l am the alpha and the omega.

45:33.648 --> 45:36.066
-Get out of my class!
-Yes, sir.

45:39.153 --> 45:41.738
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

45:51.666 --> 45:56.795
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.673
What a good boy, you are.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.888
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

46:10.476 --> 46:12.519
Come on, check that out.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.189
There you go.

46:23.489 --> 46:25.532
-Yes, Samuel?
-Hello? Mikaela?

46:25.616 --> 46:28.201
l can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.079
-Something just happened to me, okay?
-What, you finally hit puberty?

46:31.164 --> 46:32.789
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

46:32.874 --> 46:34.583
Remember l was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

46:34.667 --> 46:36.460
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

46:36.544 --> 46:39.629
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how l was telling you...

46:39.714 --> 46:42.007
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

46:42.091 --> 46:43.133
Mikaela, okay,

46:43.217 --> 46:45.302
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

46:45.386 --> 46:46.970
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

46:47.054 --> 46:48.930
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

46:49.015 --> 46:50.432
Well, now l'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.976
l just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.436
l had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.688
l am seeing symbols ever since l...

46:57.899 --> 47:01.902
-Since what?
-Ever since l touched the Cube splinter.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.987
-Do you have it?
-Yeah, l have it.

47:04.071 --> 47:07.949
-lt's in the shop safe. lt's fine.
-Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

47:08.034 --> 47:09.576
-Don't touch it.
-l'm not gonna touch it.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.495
Sam, it's fine. lt's locked away.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.914
-No one knows where it is.
-l do!

47:16.083 --> 47:18.752
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

47:20.421 --> 47:22.923
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.260
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

47:29.472 --> 47:32.265
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

47:33.184 --> 47:36.811
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!

47:39.941 --> 47:41.775
Pain... lt hurts...

47:43.027 --> 47:44.319
Hold on.

47:46.989 --> 47:49.366
Right to five, then...

47:57.667 --> 48:00.877
ls that the best you got, huh?
ls that the best you can do?

48:02.338 --> 48:04.464
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

48:04.549 --> 48:07.092
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

48:07.176 --> 48:11.388
-You gonna talk now?
-l seek knowledge from the Cube.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.223
-The Fallen demands me!
-What knowledge?

48:13.307 --> 48:15.934
You got the shard, l need the shard.
Give me the shard. l need the shard.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.562
They're gonna whack me!
l'm gonna be dead without that shard!

48:18.646 --> 48:21.731
Easy, warrior goddess,
l'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!

48:21.816 --> 48:25.110
-And l'm your worst nightmare.
-Hey, hey, hey!

48:25.194 --> 48:26.611
-What the hell was that?
-l'll tell you later,

48:26.696 --> 48:28.238
just not on an open phone line, okay?

48:28.322 --> 48:29.281
l'm gonna get on a plane right now

48:29.365 --> 48:31.575
and l'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.627
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

48:42.712 --> 48:44.421
Yeah, a live bomb!

48:44.505 --> 48:45.797
-No.
-Good.

48:58.519 --> 49:01.104
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

49:01.188 --> 49:04.983
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

49:05.067 --> 49:08.069
-As in how many?
-Unclear, sir.

49:08.154 --> 49:09.529
Well, get clear.

49:14.285 --> 49:17.078
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

49:17.163 --> 49:18.246
They're not answering our calls

49:18.331 --> 49:19.914
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

49:19.999 --> 49:23.209
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

49:24.045 --> 49:25.253
Move it!

49:27.131 --> 49:28.506
Let's go!

49:33.763 --> 49:36.890
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.

49:37.558 --> 49:41.061
Alicia, mi amor, can l interest you
in an 1 8-inch Zookeeper's special?

49:41.145 --> 49:43.647
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.774
Basically, l've got,
like, 1 8 inches of meat.

49:45.858 --> 49:48.443
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. lt's cool. l am, too.

49:48.527 --> 49:51.821
-Sam home?
-Sam? l think he died,

49:51.906 --> 49:53.198
but why don't we check?

49:53.282 --> 49:55.158
-Here we are.
-Hey!

49:55.242 --> 49:56.409
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? lt's like

49:56.494 --> 49:58.453
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

49:58.537 --> 50:02.207
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

50:02.291 --> 50:04.417
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

50:04.502 --> 50:05.835
-kitten calendar...
-Dude, what the eff?

50:05.920 --> 50:08.004
l know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

50:08.089 --> 50:10.173
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.841
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

50:11.926 --> 50:14.010
This is the part that...

50:17.723 --> 50:18.890
Okay, what were you saying?

50:18.974 --> 50:22.352
Alice, l'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

50:22.436 --> 50:23.770
Get out.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.689
Wait, wait, wait!
Can l just sit and watch?

50:25.773 --> 50:27.899
l'll... l'll eat my pizza quietly.

50:27.983 --> 50:30.902
Sam, l knew there was
something special about you.

50:30.986 --> 50:32.278
Really?

50:33.739 --> 50:35.907
And l know you know what happens

50:35.991 --> 50:38.910
when two people in the know
get together.

50:38.994 --> 50:42.288
They're genuinely amazing in bed.

50:44.125 --> 50:45.583
Thank you.

50:46.836 --> 50:48.378
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

50:48.462 --> 50:53.550
-Flag on the play. Okay. l'm very ticklish.
-We have needs, Sam. Relax.

50:53.634 --> 50:54.843
Jeez!

50:56.762 --> 50:59.848
What about this economy?
lt's crazy, isn't it?

51:01.767 --> 51:04.978
-You are very aggressive.
-Just relax.

51:05.104 --> 51:07.397
You want some turkey meatloaf?

51:12.403 --> 51:13.695
Sam?

51:15.990 --> 51:18.575
-Mikaela!
-ls that your girlfriend?

51:19.827 --> 51:20.827
Ex.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.997
Mikaela! Wait!

51:25.791 --> 51:27.751
l can explain...

51:46.187 --> 51:48.229
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

52:07.249 --> 52:08.291
All right, come on.

52:08.375 --> 52:09.918
-She's coming!
-She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

52:10.002 --> 52:11.336
-ls this real?
-Just run!

52:17.593 --> 52:20.553
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! l can't believe
l almost had sex with her in my dream!

52:20.638 --> 52:22.347
l can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!

52:22.431 --> 52:23.807
-Look, it's not my fault, okay?
-lt's not your fault?

52:23.891 --> 52:25.308
Listen! Listen, l'm a victim!

52:25.392 --> 52:26.726
-You were a victim? Of what?
-Yeah.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.645
-Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
-Of... Of molestation.

52:28.729 --> 52:30.438
lt was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

52:30.523 --> 52:31.856
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

52:31.941 --> 52:33.066
-l didn't! Look!
-You did!

52:33.150 --> 52:35.652
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

52:35.736 --> 52:38.905
lt's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

52:39.031 --> 52:42.325
-Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
-You're such a little girl!

52:42.409 --> 52:44.327
We're gonna have
1 0 seconds of silence right now.

52:44.411 --> 52:45.620
l'm not talking to you for 1 0 seconds.

52:45.704 --> 52:47.539
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

52:47.623 --> 52:50.166
l'm not talking to you for 1 0 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

52:50.251 --> 52:51.459
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

52:51.544 --> 52:53.294
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.171
-What were you gonna say?
-l hope you had a lot of fun,

52:55.256 --> 52:57.173
because this, this is over.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.676
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

52:59.760 --> 53:02.011
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

53:02.096 --> 53:04.931
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

53:05.015 --> 53:07.809
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

53:07.893 --> 53:09.018
Who are you?

53:09.103 --> 53:12.188
l'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? l'm the key to this.

53:12.273 --> 53:13.898
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.

53:19.989 --> 53:20.989
Whoa, guys, right there!

53:25.327 --> 53:26.536
Run!

53:30.416 --> 53:31.624
Mikaela!

53:49.351 --> 53:51.394
Come on! We gotta move!

53:51.896 --> 53:53.646
lt's a bomb!

54:02.865 --> 54:04.157
You've got to get that box!

54:07.745 --> 54:10.872
-This way.
-What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

54:11.999 --> 54:14.751
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

54:14.835 --> 54:17.045
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

54:17.129 --> 54:19.923
Come on, come on, come on.

54:20.341 --> 54:22.675
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

54:23.844 --> 54:25.094
Now!

54:26.680 --> 54:28.014
Tongue!

54:32.645 --> 54:34.312
Oh, my God!

54:41.570 --> 54:43.321
Kiss this, bitch!

54:48.577 --> 54:50.578
Drive, drive, drive.

54:53.374 --> 54:54.582
Okay, so what else
don't l know, all right?

54:54.667 --> 54:56.376
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

54:59.046 --> 55:02.090
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

55:07.471 --> 55:09.847
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Sam!

55:12.893 --> 55:14.310
Sam!

55:18.649 --> 55:19.983
-Sam!
-Hold on!

55:20.067 --> 55:21.401
-Pull me up!
-Hold on!

55:23.654 --> 55:25.571
Sam, get back in!

55:27.241 --> 55:30.410
l don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!

55:55.853 --> 55:57.603
Jesus! Jesus!

56:05.612 --> 56:07.405
Come here, boy.

56:08.657 --> 56:09.991
Closer.

56:10.659 --> 56:11.868
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

56:11.952 --> 56:14.370
You remember me, don't you?

56:14.455 --> 56:16.914
l did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

56:16.999 --> 56:18.291
Shut up!

56:19.126 --> 56:20.293
Sam!

56:26.508 --> 56:30.511
Yeah! Yes, yes.

56:30.971 --> 56:34.140
lt feels good to grab your flesh!

56:35.684 --> 56:40.146
l am going to kill you slowly, painfully,

56:40.230 --> 56:44.859
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

56:48.155 --> 56:50.990
How l could snap your limbs off!

56:51.075 --> 56:54.827
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

56:55.287 --> 56:58.790
l'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

57:01.668 --> 57:06.589
l'm the doctor. The odd job. lnformation!

57:08.675 --> 57:09.967
Yeah!

57:17.643 --> 57:19.852
Beseeching my shard!

57:19.937 --> 57:21.771
Easy or tough way?

57:44.586 --> 57:46.504
-There they are.
-That's what l'm seeing in my head.

57:46.588 --> 57:50.466
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

57:50.551 --> 57:54.637
We must have the brain on the table!

57:54.721 --> 57:57.306
-Chop, chop!
-Brain?

57:57.391 --> 57:58.641
What does he mean by my brain?

57:58.725 --> 58:01.644
Well, you have something on your mind,
something l need.

58:01.728 --> 58:03.688
Hold on. l know you're pissed.
l know you're pissed

58:03.772 --> 58:05.690
because l tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

58:05.774 --> 58:07.191
lf somebody tried to kill me,
l'd be upset, too.

58:07.276 --> 58:09.861
l think that we have an opportunity here

58:09.945 --> 58:13.072
to start anew
and develop our relationship

58:13.157 --> 58:15.449
and see where it leads us, okay?

58:15.534 --> 58:18.661
So, you just call Doctor lnspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!

58:18.745 --> 58:19.954
Wait, wait, wait!

58:25.586 --> 58:28.963
-Come on! Go, go!
-Sam!

58:31.216 --> 58:32.925
Go, go, go!

58:59.077 --> 59:00.286
Sam!

59:07.920 --> 59:09.128
Run!

59:16.178 --> 59:17.637
Go, go, go, go!

59:18.472 --> 59:20.014
Here he comes!

59:26.813 --> 59:28.231
Hide, Sam!

59:38.825 --> 59:40.368
Weak!

59:42.204 --> 59:45.623
Puny! Waste of metal!

59:48.585 --> 59:51.003
Junkyard crap!

59:52.839 --> 59:54.340
Decepticons!

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.894
Come here, boy.

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:41.804
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.973
The boy could lead us to it.

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.325
Optimus!

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:20.926
ls the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:24.764
-Up! Get up!
-You'll never stop at one!

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:28.392
l'll take you all on!

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.144
Piece of tin!

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.023
Sam! Where are you?

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:19.777
No!

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.988
You're so weak!

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:54.603
The last Prime is dead!

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:08.200
Sam, run. Run.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.212
Autobots, attack!

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:27.219
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.984
This is Lennox.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:58.000
-That went well.
-We've lost the boy, Master.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.586
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.924
l can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:09.303
-One insect among seven billion!
-Shut up!

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.057
He could be anywhere.

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:16.602
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:20.356
lt's time for the world
to know of our presence.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.567
No more disguises. No mercy!

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.571
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:36.872
Decepticons, mobilize. lt is time.

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.725
Speaking French is so exciting!

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.519
Oh, God, who is this?

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.190
Hello? l mean, bonsoir!

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:07.861
-What? Who is this?
-Where is the boy?

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.866
For Pete's sakes. l'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:54.116
Jeez!

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.785
You are invading my space.
l'm gonna have to drop you.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.078
Would you get out of here?

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.414
l didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:01.790
l want to try new things.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.251
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:06.962
lt's nasty.

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:22.579
Revenge is mine.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.640
Yeah!

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.894
...definitely not a plane...

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.063
Look, carriers don't just sink.

01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:51.275
...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.569
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:57.990
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.758
Citizens of the human hive,

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:19.261
your leaders have withheld the truth.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.890
You are not alone in this universe.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.685
We have lived among you, hidden,

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.354
but no more.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:35.359
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:40.532
unless you turn over this boy.

01:08:45.497 --> 01:08:51.877
lf you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.087
What we're hearing
from the German government

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:57.216
is that the worId broadcast
was a satellite hacking.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.636
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,

01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:03.471
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/1 1 .

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:05.515
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.267
somewhere in the middle
of the United States

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:11.814
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:17.277
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:20.531
WorIdwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.323
but that number could climb.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.450
lt's still too early to tell.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:25.953
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.956
The FBl is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.750
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.169
The FBl, ClA and lnterpol

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:37.589
are all seeking the cooperation
of worIdwide law enforcement.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.800
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:42.511
-They have a traffic-camera spotting...
-They have a picture of me, man.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.014
We're dead, bro.
FBl, ClA, we are wanted fugitives now!

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.307
l just need you to focus

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.350
-for one minute, man.
-Just stop.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.018
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:51.770
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.814
-Do you see this?
-What?

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.569
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:00.612
Okay, l'm not even with you guys!

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.031
Technically, l'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:04.408
-Enough is...
-Yo, Leo!

01:10:04.742 --> 01:10:06.869
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, l swear.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.329
-That's 'cause you is a wuss.
-You guys forced me into that car, right?

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.372
l think he's scared.

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.000
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.418
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:16.044
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what l mean?

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:19.047
-Not in my trunk.
-Yo, bumper cars? l'm hearing you.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:21.341
Okay? l'm right here and l can hear you!

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.594
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:25.220
l've had a hell of a day!

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.724
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:29.933
Go whine to your boyfriend!

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:32.227
Listen, Sam, l know what l'm gonna do,
man. Look, l'm just going to go

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.353
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:34.438
Like, l had nothing to do with this.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.064
-So, l'm not an accomplice.
-Hey, you wanted this, right?

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.482
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:38.901
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:41.320
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:43.947
Stop complaining.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.693
What is the meaning of this?

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.946
You dare point a gun at me?

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.783
You want a piece of me?
l will tear you apart!

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:32.162
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:33.705
-Tell them to lower their weapons!
-Tell them first.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:34.831
Tell them to lower their weapons.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:36.917
Major, there's nothing l can do.
Talk to him.

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.877
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.880
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:44.299
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.760
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.637
Well, l'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.223
and l will raise you
a President of the United States.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.766
l have operational command now.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:55.060
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.770
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.897
The secret is out!

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:02.442
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:04.444
with a coordinated military strategy.

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:07.489
This fool is terribly misinformed.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:08.949
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.742
What we need is to draw up battle plans

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.995
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.579
Like what, handing over the kid?

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.749
All options are being considered.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:22.295
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.465
-There is no negotiating with them.
-l'm ordering you to stand down.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:29.636
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:32.931
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:35.475
Let's go!

01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:40.647
l really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

01:12:40.732 --> 01:12:43.233
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:48.655
-lronhide, we should leave this planet.
-That's not what Optimus would want.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.843
There's nothing
that you could have done.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.558
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:22.564
Bee, if you hate me, l understand.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:33.533
l messed up. l'm sorry.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:39.456
Young fella, you are the person
l care about most in my life.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.626
lf there's anything you need,
l won't be far away.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.590
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:51.760
There's some things
you just can't change.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:56.014
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.601
l'm gonna make it right.
l'm going to turn myself in.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.853
We... We've got to stick together.

01:14:06.526 --> 01:14:10.195
-You're not going to do that.
-Yes, l am.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:18.036
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:22.833
-You two...
-Huh?

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.042
Hey, you know the glyphs?

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:26.586
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:31.383
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.009
That's some serious stuff, right there.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:36.138
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.639
Like a map to an Energon source!

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.976
-Can you read this?
-Read?

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.353
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:45.480
lf you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:47.190
Look who came sashaying back!

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:48.859
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.777
l had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:51.987
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.947
l think l'm allowed that,
considering what l've been through.

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:55.657
l heard you have a problem.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.743
-l think l know someone who can help.
-Who?

01:14:58.828 --> 01:14:59.995
Robo-Warrior.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:04.791
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.252
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:08.712
One time we revenge-hacked his site

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:13.216
and maybe l saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:27.606
This is it. Yep.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:28.857
Deli. Good front!

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.776
All right, wait here.
l'll give you the go/no go. All right?

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.946
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:38.158
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.576
Cash only. Who's next?

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.954
l told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.623
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.208
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.626
l'm like a ninja with a blade.
lt's an art form.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.919
Give me your money. Get out of here!

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:52.923
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:54.925
Robo-Warrior.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:58.803
-Know him?
-l never heard of him.

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:01.223
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.850
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

01:16:03.935 --> 01:16:07.062
-with Game Boy-level security.
-Robo-Warrior.

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:11.024
lt's him! lt's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:13.526
No.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:16.404
-You got to be kidding me.
-All right, meat store's closed!

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.865
-Everybody out! Out, right now!
-When he says to go,

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:20.533
-you go.
-That means you, lady, right now.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.744
-Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends.

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:26.289
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:27.707
got the kibosh, disbanded.

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:31.044
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:34.089
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:38.468
-Look at her now, so mature.
-Moron! Where's the whitefish?

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:40.428
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.097
-Yakov!
-What?

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.224
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:46.101
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.395
-lt's my dream.
-Help her out.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.063
You live with your mama?

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:51.481
No, my mama lives with me.
lt's a big difference.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.441
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:55.902
-Yeah, l know.
-And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:58.154
How did that happen? Don't answer.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.615
l don't know what you're hiding,
but l don't want anything to do with it.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.451
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
l got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.996
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, l need your help.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.665
Really? You need my help?

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.376
l need...
Look, l am slowly losing my mind.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.086
Okay, l had a little crab-bot,

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:15.297
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:18.216
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:21.052
And on top of that, l'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.305
You said it projected images
off your brain?

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.974
-Right.
-Meat locker, now!

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:27.976
Dead pigs.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.228
What you're about to see is top secret.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.023
Do not tell my mother.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.151
-Swine flu. Not good.
-Now you know.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:39.195
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.572
Sad little story.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.823
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:42.991
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.244
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:49.539
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.250
Okay, Cube-brain.

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:55.086
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.504
Where'd you get these?

01:17:56.589 --> 01:18:00.258
Before l got fired,
l poached S-7's crown jewel,

01:18:00.343 --> 01:18:05.722
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:09.768
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:11.269
How do l know?

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:14.272
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.608
in ancient ruins all over the world.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.110
China. Egypt. Greece.

01:18:20.071 --> 01:18:21.654
Shot in 1 932.

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.573
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:26.242
-Yeah.
-Same ones over here, right?

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:31.122
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:35.126
Aliens. And l think some of them stayed.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:38.129
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:43.093
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:46.471
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:50.058
l pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:53.686
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.231
that l was obsessed.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.066
Me. Can you imagine that?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.277
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:03.238
-On Earth. Another source?
-On Earth.

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:06.199
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:08.034
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:09.411
No, no, no, the source is before them.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.329
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:12.497
lt's before them.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.582
-So, it comes before them.
-Correct.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:18.044
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.213
l mean,
l'm not on speaking terms with them.

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:22.006
Actually, l am.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.054
Let me out!

01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:30.390
-This is going to be a little bit sad.
-Open it.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:34.227
l will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.770
Hey, behave!

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:37.689
-What is it, a Decepticon?
-Yeah.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.566
-And you're training him?
-l'm trying to.

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:43.153
l spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:46.573
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:49.617
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.871
l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:56.082
but, if you're a good boy,
then l'm not gonna torch your other eye.

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:57.584
Okay? l'm not gonna torch it.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:01.045
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:03.256
All right.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:07.594
l know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:11.181
l don't read it, but these guys...

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.766
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:17.645
-ls this they?
-Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:21.316
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. l don't know what.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.903
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.322
-And l know where to find them.
-Show us.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:28.740
Yeah.

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:34.412
The closest one's in Washington.

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:41.753
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.506
All l ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:48.551
-Hold those.
-What is that?

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:51.554
What? l wear them when l'm in a funk.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:56.142
So does Giambi, Jeter.
lt's a baseball thing. Okay.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:57.727
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.689
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.525
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.902
lt's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:07.695
Tricks the polygraph every time.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.531
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:12.075
No, listen, l can't do this.

01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:14.077
l'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
l'm not gonna do this.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.704
-Guards have guns. l don't want to die.
-Kid, kid, kid.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.707
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.377
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:24.712
The museum is now closing.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:27.715
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.092
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:32.178
Sir! l suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:34.681
Listen, man, l understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:36.683
All right? Thumper dumper.
l got to go. All right.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.686
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.689
-Pull your pants up and exit the building.
-l'm not going anywhere.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.071
-You got that paper, right, sir?
-You should be embarrassed.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.282
This is a family museum, sir.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:11.759
What is going on here?

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:16.347
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:18.641
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.731
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

01:22:24.815 --> 01:22:26.482
-Get your stuff and get out of here.
-Give me a second here.

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.276
l got to get the tracker, all right.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.778
-Be good.
-l'm claustrophobic.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:51.007
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:57.889
-He knows something.
-What?

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.015
He knows something.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:05.980
You got what l got?

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:07.732
-Yeah.
-Blackbird.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.320
There he is.

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:16.032
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

01:23:16.116 --> 01:23:20.328
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.462
Shit. lt's a Decepticon!

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:31.923
-Decepticon?
-Decepticon?

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:34.050
Behind the MiG now!

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.357
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.694
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:56.114
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!

01:23:57.324 --> 01:24:00.284
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.662
Bugger it!

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:07.667
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.128
Prepare for remote systems override!

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:12.755
-l tell you, this guy did not age well.
-l don't think he's gonna hurt us.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.133
l command these doors to open.

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:19.178
Fire! l said, fire!

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:21.389
Bollocks!

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:25.059
-Damn these worthless parts.
-Wait a second!

01:24:25.144 --> 01:24:28.479
ltchy, wretched rust in my arse!

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:32.734
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:34.485
We gotta catch that plane.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:41.826
-Right. l'm on a mission.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.745
-What do you want?
-Look, we just want to talk!

01:24:43.829 --> 01:24:45.580
l have no time to talk. l'm on a mission.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:48.916
l'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am l on?

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.376
-Earth.
-Earth?

01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:55.506
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:59.010
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.762
-Who's winning?
-The Decepticons.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:05.224
-Well, l changed sides to the Autobots.
-What do you mean, "changed sides"?

01:25:05.309 --> 01:25:08.811
lt's a choice.
lt's an intensely personal decision.

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:12.565
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:13.649
You mean you don't have to work

01:25:13.734 --> 01:25:15.443
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:19.071
lf Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:21.949
l'm changing sides. l'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:24.202
-Who's your little Autobot?
-You're cute.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:27.330
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.624
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:30.833
At least he's faithful, Sam.

01:25:30.918 --> 01:25:33.878
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.464
Can you just... Can you stop?

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:37.965
-Hey, what are you doing?
-lt's just something

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.967
to think about. l won't argue with...
What were you saying?

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:44.138
l told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:45.640
Somebody shit the bed this morning.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.308
-Look at this guy.
-l have issues of my own.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:48.893
And it started with my mother!

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.437
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:54.482
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:56.818
-Do you know what he transformed into?
-No.

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:57.944
Nothing!

01:25:58.028 --> 01:26:01.697
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

01:26:08.539 --> 01:26:09.539
Bollocks.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:12.083
My boosters are fried.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:15.294
l think we can help each other.

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:18.256
You know things l don't know.
l know things you don't know, l do.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.758
l don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, l don't.

01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:24.846
l could do this all day.
lt comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.890
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:29.851
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:33.145
-Him and someone called The Fallen.
-The Fallen? l know him.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.482
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:40.361
He's terrible to work for.
lt's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:42.488
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:43.531
The Fallen's search.

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:47.201
l remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:49.370
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:53.958
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:21.903
Well, that wasn't so bad.

01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:23.654
l just hope we're still on the right planet.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:25.698
Hey, that freaking hurt!

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:28.326
Oh, my God.

01:27:35.334 --> 01:27:36.834
Oh, God.

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:43.257
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

01:27:43.342 --> 01:27:47.303
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:49.013
Please, get off.

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:52.391
God, my balls.

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:54.852
Sam!

01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:59.065
-Where are we? Simmons!
-Hey! Yeah!

01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:04.111
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? lt's Vegas.

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:06.030
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.616
Hey, l think we're in Vegas!

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:12.286
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that l didn't get hurt!

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:15.039
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if l would have gotten hurt,

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.083
-you would have heard...
-Shut up.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:21.462
l told you l was opening a space bridge.
lt's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:24.382
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:26.217
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:30.888
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:32.640
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:33.891
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:36.644
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:40.147
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:42.984
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.987
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:48.656
the lifeblood of our race.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:53.577
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.581
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:00.584
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:06.590
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:11.512
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:15.808
lt harvests Energon by destroying suns.

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:17.601
-Destroy suns?
-You mean blow them up?

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:19.562
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:22.773
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:26.944
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:33.034
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:36.037
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:40.374
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.503
He despised the human race

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:49.884
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:54.013
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:57.183
called the Matrix of Leadership.

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:07.860
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.159
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:20.998
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.

01:30:21.625 --> 01:30:26.462
ln the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:29.715
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:33.344
a tomb we cannot find.

01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:40.476
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.603
The Fallen knows where it is

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:48.317
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.319
Okay, so how do we stop him?

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:52.780
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.448
Optimus Prime?

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.994
So, you've met a Prime?

01:30:59.079 --> 01:31:02.164
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

01:31:02.249 --> 01:31:05.376
ls he alive, here on this planet?

01:31:06.086 --> 01:31:08.379
He sacrificed himself to save me.

01:31:08.839 --> 01:31:10.297
So, he's dead.

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:14.468
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:18.556
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.267
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:22.393
and bring him back to life?

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:27.189
lt was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:31.152
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:34.446
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:37.158
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:42.454
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:44.498
Find the doorway!

01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:46.458
Go now! Go!

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:49.461
That was my mission.
lt's your mission now.

01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:53.841
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:01.682
Okay, here's what my ClA contact says.

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:05.311
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf ofAqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

01:32:05.395 --> 01:32:07.271
-That's the Dagger's Tip.
-lt's part of the Red Sea.

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.523
lt divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:13.444
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:15.905
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:18.449
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:19.700
l'm gonna make a call.

01:32:22.621 --> 01:32:23.913
We got cops!

01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:31.295
l can't go to prison, guys.

01:32:35.217 --> 01:32:37.801
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

01:32:48.355 --> 01:32:50.231
Man, stupid cops!

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:52.524
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:56.403
-Shut up or l'll blend my fist in your face.
-They're gone.

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:59.114
Okay, we're running out of time.
l gotta make the call to Lennox...

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:00.532
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:03.244
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:05.955
-ClA is all over this place!
-You're gonna call.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:14.088
-Okay. That's a good idea.
-All right.

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:16.590
l mean, l just had my mind
on other things,

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.133
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:23.180
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:28.310
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

01:33:33.692 --> 01:33:35.901
Major Lennox, phone call.

01:33:36.695 --> 01:33:39.780
Lennox, l'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:41.448
We need the truck. The truck.

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:44.285
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

01:33:44.369 --> 01:33:48.622
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

01:33:48.707 --> 01:33:50.249
Back of a $1 bill.

01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:57.006
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:59.800
Oh, my God. l got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:01.427
Wait, who are you?

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:05.139
Wait. lt's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:06.307
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:08.183
Move, move, move, move.

01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:13.063
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

01:34:13.148 --> 01:34:15.607
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf ofAqaba.

01:34:15.692 --> 01:34:18.235
Egypt? Are you serious?

01:34:19.863 --> 01:34:20.946
Sir.

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:28.078
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.831
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:34.251
Look, l don't know,
but we got to trust him.

01:34:36.588 --> 01:34:37.921
Okay, let's go over it again.

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:40.174
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:42.551
-the Three Kings...
-Will reveal the doorway.

01:34:42.635 --> 01:34:44.428
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.055
-No, what does it mean?
-l have no idea.

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:47.931
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.433
l don't have my passport.

01:34:51.811 --> 01:34:53.187
Passport!

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.112
They got cameras at the top.

01:35:06.076 --> 01:35:09.536
All right, chill. This is espionage time.
l can handle it.

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:12.664
These are my people.
l'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

01:35:15.585 --> 01:35:17.086
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:19.630
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

01:35:28.473 --> 01:35:31.308
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:33.894
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

01:35:33.978 --> 01:35:37.231
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:40.943
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

01:35:41.027 --> 01:35:42.903
-New York?
-Yes. Yes.

01:35:42.987 --> 01:35:44.029
Fifty kilometers.

01:35:44.114 --> 01:35:46.448
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

01:35:46.908 --> 01:35:48.700
-l know. l know you from somewhere.
-Go, Yankees!

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:50.536
Put it on the wire to the ClA.

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:59.670
Decepticons, boy's location detected.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.598
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:14.017
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:25.195
Awesome! l think aliens built that.

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:26.572
Yeah, yeah.

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:29.366
Come on. Move it! Move it!

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:31.577
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:34.746
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

01:36:56.352 --> 01:36:59.438
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:04.401
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:06.403
-Do they?
-Yeah.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.408
You might as well just say it.

01:37:11.493 --> 01:37:12.951
Ladies first.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:17.122
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.

01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:20.334
-You're really chivalrous.
-Why are you mad at me?

01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:23.921
You know what?
Baby, l'm not... l'm not mad.

01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:29.510
Do you realize that l just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

01:37:29.594 --> 01:37:30.802
l know.

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.808
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:39.603
Look at the things l go through with you.

01:37:40.230 --> 01:37:42.397
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

01:37:42.482 --> 01:37:44.691
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:47.110
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

01:37:48.196 --> 01:37:49.571
Pyramids.

01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:52.199
What? Why do boys always

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:54.243
-change the subject?
-Pyramids and stars.

01:37:54.327 --> 01:37:55.786
-Sam?
-Come with me really quick.

01:38:03.962 --> 01:38:06.046
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

01:38:09.342 --> 01:38:11.635
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.388
No. l was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:16.640
-Here. Get up. Up, up.
-What is he talking about?

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:23.063
Okay, you see those three stars?

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:24.898
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:27.734
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:29.611
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

01:38:29.696 --> 01:38:32.489
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

01:38:32.574 --> 01:38:34.408
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:37.953
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

01:38:50.967 --> 01:38:52.259
We've had an engine malfunction.

01:38:52.343 --> 01:38:54.303
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.

01:38:54.387 --> 01:38:56.471
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:59.016
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.019
-All right, team, grab your chutes!
-Bailout like bailout?

01:39:04.606 --> 01:39:07.065
-You familiar with the standard MC-4?
-Of course not!

01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:09.443
l've neverjumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!

01:39:09.527 --> 01:39:10.902
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

01:39:10.987 --> 01:39:12.779
-Yeah.
-All right, here we go.

01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:17.451
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

01:39:17.535 --> 01:39:19.161
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:23.123
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:26.376
l'm just following orders to the letter.
lsn't that what you said?

01:39:27.003 --> 01:39:30.088
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.303
What was that? What was that?

01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:38.722
That's not good. Come on.

01:39:39.724 --> 01:39:41.224
-Right this way!
-l can't jump out of an airplane!

01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:43.352
-l have an ulcer! No, no.
-Come on. lt's okay.

01:39:43.728 --> 01:39:45.979
l really can't do this.
What are you doing...

01:39:46.522 --> 01:39:48.565
Come here! Come here.

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:52.903
-Why aren't you wearing your chute?
-Because l have to secure the VlPs first.

01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:57.199
Okay, l want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that l say.

01:39:57.283 --> 01:40:00.243
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

01:40:00.328 --> 01:40:02.454
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:04.665
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:06.833
-Okay, are you listening?
-l can't hear what...

01:40:06.918 --> 01:40:08.335
-Stop that!
-All right. All right.

01:40:08.419 --> 01:40:10.879
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

01:40:10.963 --> 01:40:13.131
it pulls the pin and opens the main.

01:40:13.216 --> 01:40:15.258
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.

01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:19.513
l want you to pull the blue.
l need you to pull it really hard!

01:40:19.597 --> 01:40:22.432
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

01:40:25.311 --> 01:40:28.313
-He say good-bye?
-No, he didn't even say good-bye.

01:40:28.773 --> 01:40:30.565
General, we're loaded and ready.

01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:33.527
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:36.154
-Excellent.
-Sir, you need to see this now.

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:41.159
-Have we checked these coordinates?
-Egypt, sir.

01:40:41.244 --> 01:40:44.037
-They're airdropping in.
-You've got to be kidding me.

01:40:44.122 --> 01:40:45.497
He knows something.

01:40:45.581 --> 01:40:47.958
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:50.377
Copy that.

01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:52.921
ClA just got a hit on the boy,

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:55.549
1 00 miles from the location
on that little note there.

01:40:55.633 --> 01:40:56.717
lt's getting hotter.

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.807
lt's gotta be around here somewhere.

01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:27.038
You see the size of this?

01:41:27.749 --> 01:41:30.167
-You see this?
-Spectacular.

01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:34.296
Amazing. Look at that.

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.850
-lt's here somewhere, guys.
-Yeah, why?

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.477
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:50.061
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:54.149
ln his defense, this is the biggest
doorway l've ever seen in my entire life.

01:41:54.901 --> 01:41:58.445
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?

01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:00.113
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,

01:42:00.198 --> 01:42:01.615
that archeologists
have been here before?

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:02.783
There's nothing here.

01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:05.243
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.

01:42:05.328 --> 01:42:07.454
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:09.706
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

01:42:09.791 --> 01:42:12.167
l'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

01:42:13.336 --> 01:42:15.462
-lt's not over.
-lt is over. lt's done.

01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:17.047
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:19.174
l mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

01:42:19.258 --> 01:42:21.218
Killed Megatron. How about that?

01:42:21.302 --> 01:42:22.344
Well, he didn't get the job done,

01:42:22.428 --> 01:42:23.970
you know what l mean,
'cause he's back now...

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:26.973
-Are you scared?
-Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:29.476
l'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.311
Bring it, then! Get off me!

01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:34.481
-l'll change your face around!
-l'll get all up in that ass!

01:42:34.565 --> 01:42:35.982
Bring it!

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:37.901
Guys!

01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:40.821
-You like the way that feels?
-That didn't hurt.

01:42:40.905 --> 01:42:42.447
You like that, don't you?

01:42:42.532 --> 01:42:44.908
-Come on, Bumblebee!
-Bumblebee, listen.

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:52.582
Now, that's rude.

01:43:04.554 --> 01:43:06.513
Oh, my God. The symbols.

01:43:07.765 --> 01:43:09.599
Bee! Shoot it.

01:43:35.459 --> 01:43:38.128
-Check this out.
-Look at it.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.380
Wow!

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:42.966
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:45.427
The tomb of the Primes.

01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:49.639
Yo!

01:44:03.654 --> 01:44:04.988
The Matrix.

01:44:22.548 --> 01:44:26.134
No.

01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:31.056
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.642
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

01:44:33.726 --> 01:44:34.893
Hear that?

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.816
US Air Force! C-1 7s!

01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:44.611
-What's a C-1 7?
-You can't bring him back, Sam.

01:44:44.695 --> 01:44:48.281
-There's nothing left.
-Look! Look around you.

01:44:48.366 --> 01:44:50.951
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

01:44:51.035 --> 01:44:52.452
to just have it end like this.

01:44:52.536 --> 01:44:54.204
There is a reason that we are here.

01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:58.166
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

01:45:04.048 --> 01:45:06.341
Everyone's after me
because of what l know,

01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:11.846
and what l know is that
this is going to work.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:15.350
-How do you know it's gonna work?
-Because l believe it.

01:45:25.403 --> 01:45:27.737
You best let me out of this plane.

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:41.376
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

01:45:48.509 --> 01:45:50.760
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

01:45:50.845 --> 01:45:52.429
Absolutely. Let's go.

01:46:02.523 --> 01:46:03.732
Go!

01:46:04.567 --> 01:46:07.277
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:19.456
Cover Optimus!

01:46:22.418 --> 01:46:24.502
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

01:46:24.587 --> 01:46:26.713
l need snipers and Stingers up high.

01:46:26.797 --> 01:46:30.925
So, we just dropped off 1 0 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:32.635
l hope this little kid know
what he's doing.

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.762
Yeah, me too.

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:42.937
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:47.567
Pop flare!

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:52.447
-That's them, right there. See the flare?
-Right over there! See it?

01:47:03.501 --> 01:47:04.667
Sam!

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:18.556
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

01:47:18.641 --> 01:47:20.266
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:21.768
Shut this guy up, huh?

01:47:21.852 --> 01:47:24.270
-Please, just let me live, just let me live!
-Shut up and let him drive!

01:47:24.355 --> 01:47:25.647
-Just stop screaming...
-All right, that's it!

01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:29.818
l can't take that guy anymore.

01:47:43.082 --> 01:47:45.166
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

01:47:52.758 --> 01:47:54.717
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

01:47:54.802 --> 01:47:57.470
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? l'm gonna get Optimus.

01:47:57.555 --> 01:48:00.098
l'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

01:48:00.182 --> 01:48:02.225
You get to those soldiers.

01:48:03.352 --> 01:48:06.396
-l hope that dust works, kid.
-Thank you.

01:48:10.192 --> 01:48:13.653
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

01:48:14.405 --> 01:48:15.446
lt's up to me.

01:48:15.739 --> 01:48:18.408
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:20.994
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

01:48:21.078 --> 01:48:24.747
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

01:48:24.832 --> 01:48:27.834
-Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
-You'll never make it, kid.

01:48:27.918 --> 01:48:30.378
-l'm coming with you.
-Bravery will only get you so far.

01:48:30.462 --> 01:48:33.381
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
l'm going.

01:48:33.465 --> 01:48:35.258
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

01:48:43.559 --> 01:48:46.978
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

01:48:51.066 --> 01:48:53.234
-What the hell was that?
-Anyone copy?

01:48:53.319 --> 01:48:55.361
-Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy?

01:48:55.446 --> 01:48:57.739
-Radio's down.
-lt's dead. Comms are down.

01:48:57.823 --> 01:48:59.157
EMP burst.

01:48:59.533 --> 01:49:02.410
l see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

01:49:04.163 --> 01:49:05.205
Yes, sir?

01:49:05.289 --> 01:49:08.124
-Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
-l know, sir.

01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:11.044
Well, what country am l in right now?

01:49:11.128 --> 01:49:12.378
United States.

01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:16.382
No, not the United States.
l'm from the United States.

01:49:16.467 --> 01:49:19.135
I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:24.057
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.

01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:26.809
How is it that we can't reach our men,

01:49:26.894 --> 01:49:32.273
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

01:49:36.278 --> 01:49:37.528
Nothing.

01:49:38.113 --> 01:49:40.990
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

01:49:41.075 --> 01:49:43.076
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, boys, old school time!

01:49:43.619 --> 01:49:45.995
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

01:49:51.585 --> 01:49:55.046
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

01:49:55.714 --> 01:50:00.551
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:06.015
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:08.768
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

01:50:08.852 --> 01:50:11.229
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.

01:50:11.313 --> 01:50:14.941
Damn it. Something's not right.
lt doesn't add up.

01:50:15.025 --> 01:50:18.444
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

01:50:18.529 --> 01:50:20.905
and get Egypt's General Salam.

01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:24.867
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

01:50:24.952 --> 01:50:28.037
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

01:50:28.289 --> 01:50:29.872
Scramble Predators now.

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.457
V-1 , rotate.

01:50:43.512 --> 01:50:45.346
We still have a mile that way.

01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:52.395
Come on.

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:57.066
This way. This way.

01:51:01.697 --> 01:51:05.033
-One man, alone...
-Stop saying that!

01:51:05.117 --> 01:51:06.367
...betrayed by the country he loves!

01:51:06.452 --> 01:51:08.661
Oh, my goodness.
l'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:11.831
Just relax. You're with the maestro.

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:22.550
l don't think he's still following us.

01:51:23.552 --> 01:51:25.219
That's what you think.

01:51:42.071 --> 01:51:45.823
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

01:51:45.908 --> 01:51:48.951
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

01:51:49.036 --> 01:51:51.245
The boy must have the Matrix.

01:51:51.663 --> 01:51:54.290
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:58.628
Decepticons, begin our assault!

01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:00.963
We've got incoming!

01:52:17.106 --> 01:52:20.024
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.

01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:22.110
-How many?
-About 1 3 of them.

01:52:22.194 --> 01:52:24.862
This ain't good. This ain't good.

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:35.289
We're about to get our asses whupped.

01:52:36.417 --> 01:52:38.209
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

01:52:38.293 --> 01:52:41.170
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

01:52:42.548 --> 01:52:45.466
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

01:52:45.551 --> 01:52:48.428
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

01:52:48.512 --> 01:52:51.305
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. l need a scout team.

01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:52.432
l'm leading.

01:52:52.516 --> 01:52:54.934
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and lronhide!

01:52:55.018 --> 01:52:56.561
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

01:52:56.645 --> 01:52:59.397
l want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

01:52:59.481 --> 01:53:02.692
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

01:53:14.788 --> 01:53:17.081
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

01:53:18.542 --> 01:53:21.752
-With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
-No, why?

01:53:25.007 --> 01:53:27.842
-Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
-ls that good?

01:53:30.053 --> 01:53:31.596
A lot of people died.

01:53:50.574 --> 01:53:51.741
Hide!

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:55.244
-Vamonos, amigos!
-Oh, my God!

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.167
-Hit the deck!
-Oh, my God!

01:54:17.184 --> 01:54:18.267
Sam, Sam.

01:54:19.353 --> 01:54:21.395
l don't think they saw us.

01:54:21.939 --> 01:54:23.773
Get down. Get down. Get down.

01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:25.733
Okay. Listen.

01:54:27.611 --> 01:54:30.947
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

01:54:32.282 --> 01:54:33.783
What if it doesn't work?

01:54:34.618 --> 01:54:36.202
lt's gonna work.

01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:39.288
-What if it doesn't?
-lt's gonna work. lt'll work.

01:56:15.719 --> 01:56:17.178
Up, up, up!

01:56:27.147 --> 01:56:28.814
Get ready to jump!

01:56:47.668 --> 01:56:50.336
We got a half-mile. l don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:54.382
Fall back!

01:56:54.466 --> 01:56:57.927
-lronhide, up the middle!
-lronhide, move it!

01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:00.012
Let's go! Go, go!

01:57:07.187 --> 01:57:08.562
Devastator!

01:57:12.025 --> 01:57:13.943
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

01:57:14.111 --> 01:57:16.737
lf we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:50.730
Look at this mother...

01:57:50.814 --> 01:57:52.481
Mean robots suck!

01:58:04.453 --> 01:58:07.037
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

01:58:11.668 --> 01:58:13.461
-Simmons!
-Don't let go!

01:58:13.545 --> 01:58:16.005
Hang in there, l got you! Just hang in.

01:58:20.135 --> 01:58:21.635
l don't want to die!

01:58:23.305 --> 01:58:25.181
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:26.515
You ain't getting me!

01:58:31.563 --> 01:58:33.856
He dead. He got so ate.

01:58:34.191 --> 01:58:37.109
-Who's your daddy now, huh?
-He got all ate up.

01:58:37.194 --> 01:58:39.320
The only safe place is right under it.

01:58:39.404 --> 01:58:43.073
-Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
-Yeah.

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:53.292
You should've never eaten me!
l'm gonna bust your face up!

01:58:58.298 --> 01:58:59.465
Oh, my God!

01:59:02.219 --> 01:59:04.720
Nobody mess with me! ln your face!

01:59:05.639 --> 01:59:07.306
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:08.474
Oh, my God!

01:59:16.233 --> 01:59:18.192
Nobody messes with the twins.

01:59:22.072 --> 01:59:24.240
l got you... My bad!

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:29.078
Man! You shot me in the face!

01:59:29.496 --> 01:59:31.789
-Stay under it!
-Yeah, stay under it!

01:59:35.752 --> 01:59:37.086
Come on.

01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:54.478
Judy!

01:59:59.568 --> 02:00:01.652
-Sam! Sam!
-What?

02:00:02.654 --> 02:00:04.613
Sam! Sam!

02:00:09.077 --> 02:00:10.327
Sam!

02:00:10.412 --> 02:00:11.745
-Sam!
-Dad!

02:00:19.462 --> 02:00:20.880
Wait, wait!

Please listen to me!
l want you to run! Run!

02:00:25.719 --> 02:00:28.429
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!

02:00:28.513 --> 02:00:29.972
-Oh, God!
-Wait!

02:00:30.056 --> 02:00:31.932
Sam Witwicky.

02:00:32.017 --> 02:00:36.312
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

02:00:36.396 --> 02:00:38.063
-Go! Go!
-Please, stop!

02:00:38.148 --> 02:00:39.315
-Stop!
-Listen to your father!

02:00:39.399 --> 02:00:41.191
Just get out of here!

02:00:41.526 --> 02:00:43.903
Just don't hurt them.
l know what you want.

02:00:43.987 --> 02:00:45.487
Just go! Just go!

02:00:45.572 --> 02:00:49.366
And l know that you need me
because l know about the Matrix.

02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:51.535
-Don't do it, Sam...
-Please, Dad.

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:55.581
-They're going to kill us all anyway!
-Here's what you want, right here.

02:00:55.957 --> 02:00:57.374
Bumblebee!

02:01:10.597 --> 02:01:12.222
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

02:01:50.178 --> 02:01:52.721
-Stay tight, Ma.
-Come on. Get in here.

02:02:06.653 --> 02:02:08.404
-Bee?
-Yeah.

02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:13.033
-Hey!
-l don't know

02:02:13.118 --> 02:02:15.077
what's going on, but we've got to move!

02:02:19.249 --> 02:02:21.083
There's got to be a way out of here!

02:02:22.419 --> 02:02:24.503
Judy, get back, get back, get back.

02:02:25.714 --> 02:02:28.716
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

02:02:30.093 --> 02:02:32.094
Bee! Bumblebee!

02:02:32.929 --> 02:02:34.930
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

02:02:37.267 --> 02:02:38.434
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

02:02:38.518 --> 02:02:40.352
No, this isn't up for discussion!

02:02:40.437 --> 02:02:42.354
-You're my son! You're my son!
-l know.

02:02:42.439 --> 02:02:43.689
-Dad...
-We all go together!

02:02:43.773 --> 02:02:45.065
-Listen...
-We're all going together!

02:02:45.150 --> 02:02:48.444
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

02:02:48.528 --> 02:02:50.779
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.

02:02:50.864 --> 02:02:53.449
You hear what l'm saying, okay?
l'll find you when you're safe.

02:02:53.533 --> 02:02:55.034
-No.
-You've got to let me go, Dad.

02:02:55.118 --> 02:02:58.454
-You have to let me go. You have to.
-Ron.

02:03:01.124 --> 02:03:03.584
Ron. Ron, let him go.

02:03:05.628 --> 02:03:07.963
You come back! Come on.

02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:09.840
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

02:03:09.924 --> 02:03:12.468
-Go with my parents.
-l'm not gonna go without you.

02:03:23.772 --> 02:03:25.314
Move to cover!

02:03:29.569 --> 02:03:31.320
We got Jordanians!

02:03:31.404 --> 02:03:32.863
We got help!

02:03:38.995 --> 02:03:40.245

02:03:56.805 --> 02:03:58.430
You okay, soldier?

02:03:58.515 --> 02:04:01.683
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.

02:04:01.768 --> 02:04:03.685
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.

02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:06.063
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

02:04:07.524 --> 02:04:11.985
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what l did for my country.

02:04:13.488 --> 02:04:15.155
This is my moment.

02:04:15.907 --> 02:04:16.990
You're crazy!

02:04:19.077 --> 02:04:20.953
ETA to station, two minutes.

02:04:21.037 --> 02:04:22.913
-Put it on the main screen.
-Sir. Yes, sir.

02:04:22.997 --> 02:04:24.373
Predator 01 .

02:04:34.884 --> 02:04:36.093
Shit, it's a trick.

02:04:36.177 --> 02:04:38.595
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:41.265
-Get those Marines on the ground.
-Roll in strike packages...

02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:43.225
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.

02:05:03.746 --> 02:05:06.290
-Spotted Sam!
-Sam!

02:05:06.749 --> 02:05:08.041
lronhide!

02:05:08.918 --> 02:05:11.086
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

02:05:13.923 --> 02:05:16.592
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!

02:05:17.844 --> 02:05:18.927
Let's go.

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:26.143
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

02:05:26.227 --> 02:05:30.606
lf they turn that machine on,
no more sun.

02:05:33.067 --> 02:05:37.487
Not on my watch.

02:05:48.458 --> 02:05:50.000
USS Stennis. ldentify.

02:05:50.084 --> 02:05:52.502
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

02:05:52.587 --> 02:05:54.463
SportsCenter?
l Dream of Jeannie orsomething?

02:05:54.547 --> 02:05:58.550
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

02:05:58.635 --> 02:06:00.135
ldentify yourself.

02:06:00.637 --> 02:06:01.887
What is your name, sailor?

02:06:02.472 --> 02:06:07.434
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.

02:06:08.770 --> 02:06:10.395
Okay, Captain Wilder.

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:12.814
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.

02:06:12.899 --> 02:06:15.275
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.152
getting ready to blow up our sun.

02:06:17.237 --> 02:06:19.071
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

02:06:19.155 --> 02:06:21.156
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

02:06:22.158 --> 02:06:24.493
All right, Agent Simmons. l'm listening.

02:06:31.668 --> 02:06:34.378
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

02:06:34.462 --> 02:06:37.422
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.

02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:40.550
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,

02:06:40.635 --> 02:06:43.679
-shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
-That's classified.

02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:47.349
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?

02:06:47.433 --> 02:06:50.102
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which l know you do,

02:06:50.186 --> 02:06:52.729
you tell them to ready that weapon!

02:06:54.107 --> 02:06:56.316
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

02:06:57.193 --> 02:06:58.860
Alpha Team, flank left!

02:06:58.945 --> 02:07:00.696
This way! Move it!

02:07:02.657 --> 02:07:04.908
-Where do you need us, sir?
-Protect those in the line of fire.

02:07:04.993 --> 02:07:06.618
Let's go! Go!

02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:13.041
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!

02:07:17.422 --> 02:07:19.798
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

02:07:19.882 --> 02:07:22.467
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

02:07:22.552 --> 02:07:23.677
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

02:07:27.765 --> 02:07:29.349
B-1 , snap 090.

02:07:29.434 --> 02:07:31.852
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.

02:07:39.068 --> 02:07:40.402
-What you got?
-l couldn't get to them, sir.

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:42.529
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

02:07:42.613 --> 02:07:45.490
All right. Precious cargo's coming!

02:07:45.825 --> 02:07:46.825
Move!

02:07:57.670 --> 02:07:59.212
Curse you!

02:08:13.186 --> 02:08:15.270
Sam! Spotted Sam!

02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:49.304
-Come on!
-2-2 covering fire.

02:08:49.389 --> 02:08:50.806
Two civilians, 1 2 o'clock!

02:08:59.357 --> 02:09:00.941
Cover for us!

02:09:07.323 --> 02:09:10.117
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!

02:09:22.422 --> 02:09:24.005
Keep firing!

02:09:30.012 --> 02:09:31.680
Come on! Mikaela!

02:09:32.098 --> 02:09:34.433
Come on! Get in here!

02:09:35.351 --> 02:09:36.810
Look who showed up.

02:09:36.894 --> 02:09:38.895
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

02:09:38.980 --> 02:09:40.689
-Where's Optimus?
-He's right over there,

02:09:40.773 --> 02:09:42.190
across the courtyard.

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:45.235
-l got to get to him right now.
-Not with an air strike coming.

02:09:45.319 --> 02:09:47.529
l have to get to him right now.

02:09:49.073 --> 02:09:50.407
Go. Back, back, back, back.

02:09:50.491 --> 02:09:52.200
-Go.
-Listen up...

02:09:55.663 --> 02:09:56.872
Okay.

02:10:00.501 --> 02:10:01.877
lncoming!

02:10:02.879 --> 02:10:05.088
Stick the landing.

02:10:06.007 --> 02:10:08.884
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

02:10:10.178 --> 02:10:13.722
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

02:10:33.784 --> 02:10:35.076
l'm too old for this crap.

02:10:35.244 --> 02:10:37.913
Keep going, man, 1 5 rounds of fighting.

02:10:58.059 --> 02:11:01.561
l am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

02:11:02.313 --> 02:11:05.607
25.7 meters above sea IeveI,
29.32 north.

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:07.901
-Kill track, 5205...
-Target acquired.

02:11:07.985 --> 02:11:10.570
-Killing track.
-Two, one...

02:11:10.655 --> 02:11:11.947
Fire!

02:11:26.128 --> 02:11:27.796
Yeah! Yeah!

02:11:28.172 --> 02:11:31.841
B-1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

02:11:31.926 --> 02:11:34.052
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?

02:11:34.136 --> 02:11:37.055
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

02:11:37.265 --> 02:11:40.517
-1-1 tally orange smoke.
-l hope these F-1 6s got good aim.

02:11:40.601 --> 02:11:44.145
-Yeah? Why is that?
-l told them to hit the orange smoke.

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.190
You mean that orange smoke?

02:11:47.275 --> 02:11:48.858
lt wasn't my best toss, okay?

02:11:48.943 --> 02:11:51.695
-Viper, thunder.
-Run!

02:12:00.705 --> 02:12:01.997
lncoming!

02:12:05.084 --> 02:12:06.334
Come on!

02:12:26.606 --> 02:12:27.772
Sam!

02:12:35.615 --> 02:12:36.865
Run!

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:40.869
Die!

02:12:47.918 --> 02:12:49.169
Sam!

02:13:05.394 --> 02:13:06.895
Hold your fire!

02:13:09.315 --> 02:13:10.482
Sam!

02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:14.361
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

02:13:16.405 --> 02:13:18.448
Fucking do something!

02:13:53.859 --> 02:14:00.115
-Sam! Sam!
-Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

02:14:01.909 --> 02:14:03.702
-Let me go!
-Come on, you got to move.

02:14:03.786 --> 02:14:06.538
-You got to move, come on.
-We got no pulse.

02:14:06.622 --> 02:14:07.747
Starting CPR.

02:14:07.832 --> 02:14:11.042
-l have to see my kid! l got a son...
-Sammy!

02:14:11.794 --> 02:14:12.919
Sam!

02:14:15.256 --> 02:14:16.798
-Clear.
-Ready to shock.

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:19.634
-Clear!
-Ready to shock. One, two, three.

02:14:22.596 --> 02:14:24.013
Do it again!

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.854
No!

02:14:32.898 --> 02:14:37.986
Okay, listen to my voice.
l love you and l need you.

02:14:39.238 --> 02:14:42.782
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

02:14:42.867 --> 02:14:44.451

02:14:53.836 --> 02:14:58.173
Where am l? Where am l?
Am l dead? Am l dead?

02:14:58.674 --> 02:15:02.969
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

02:15:05.347 --> 02:15:09.350
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

02:15:09.435 --> 02:15:14.522
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

02:15:15.441 --> 02:15:18.026
a leader worthy of our secret.

02:15:18.569 --> 02:15:23.198
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.

02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:26.659
Return now to Optimus.

02:15:27.369 --> 02:15:29.704
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

02:15:30.247 --> 02:15:34.834
lt is, and always has been, your destiny.

02:15:39.757 --> 02:15:40.882
Sam!

02:15:47.389 --> 02:15:49.808
l love you. l love you.

02:16:27.263 --> 02:16:30.598
Boy, you returned for me.

02:16:31.934 --> 02:16:33.893
A living Prime.

02:16:35.478 --> 02:16:37.689
l don't believe it!

02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:50.159
My Matrix!

02:16:55.499 --> 02:16:57.416
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

02:16:58.294 --> 02:16:59.835
Get up, Prime!

02:17:01.754 --> 02:17:03.130
Oh, no.

02:17:03.465 --> 02:17:07.468
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:09.304
Optimus!

02:17:11.514 --> 02:17:13.892
Fallen, my master.

02:17:13.976 --> 02:17:18.438
My brothers could not stop me from this.

02:17:19.315 --> 02:17:23.692
Yes, now l claim your sun.

02:17:25.987 --> 02:17:29.115
-Move!
-Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

02:17:29.199 --> 02:17:30.742
Engage! Engage!

02:17:36.206 --> 02:17:39.166
ln moments, we'll be at firing strength.

02:17:54.767 --> 02:17:59.312
All my Decepticon life, l never did
a thing worth doing until now.

02:17:59.855 --> 02:18:02.773
Optimus, take my parts

02:18:02.858 --> 02:18:06.027
and you will have a power
you've never known.

02:18:06.986 --> 02:18:09.030
Fulfill your destiny.

02:18:15.329 --> 02:18:17.163
Jolt! Electrify!

02:18:17.623 --> 02:18:19.540
Transplant those afterburners.

02:18:37.893 --> 02:18:39.519
Let's roll.

02:18:41.981 --> 02:18:44.065
Fire mission on the pyramids.

02:18:55.911 --> 02:18:59.371
This planet will be dark forever.

02:19:21.602 --> 02:19:24.022
Die, like your brothers!

02:19:24.647 --> 02:19:26.898
They were your brothers, too.

02:19:55.763 --> 02:19:57.638
Starscream!

02:20:10.652 --> 02:20:12.820
You picked the wrong planet.

02:20:15.783 --> 02:20:17.658
Give me your face.

02:20:26.168 --> 02:20:27.835
l rise.

02:20:28.378 --> 02:20:30.004
You fall.

02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:35.218
No, no.

02:20:37.304 --> 02:20:39.722
Not to call you a coward, Master,

02:20:39.807 --> 02:20:45.478
but sometimes cowards do survive.

02:20:46.063 --> 02:20:48.022
This isn't over.

02:21:15.717 --> 02:21:18.594
lt took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

02:21:20.222 --> 02:21:21.764
You said it first.

02:22:12.941 --> 02:22:15.568
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

02:22:16.862 --> 02:22:18.154
Welcome.

02:22:18.947 --> 02:22:20.656
Thank you for believing in me.

02:22:25.495 --> 02:22:30.041
Our races united by a history
long forgotten

02:22:30.125 --> 02:22:33.544
and a future we shall face together.

02:22:34.087 --> 02:22:36.505
I am Optimus Prime,

02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:41.594
and l send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,

02:22:41.678 --> 02:22:45.598
for in those memories, we Iive on.

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:11.290
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.

02:23:11.792 --> 02:23:13.709
Yeah, l was kind of busy.

02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:17.588
Okay.
