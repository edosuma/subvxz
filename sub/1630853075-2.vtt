WEBVTT

00:02.561 --> 00:07.089
(birds chirping)

00:21.764 --> 00:24.639
Watch this.

00:24.641 --> 00:25.691
You wanna maybe go...?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.860
Oh, wait, let me think.
Uh, how about--

00:27.862 --> 00:29.010
no thanks, Fargas.

00:29.012 --> 00:31.196
(laughter)

00:31.198 --> 00:33.257
Falls for it every time.

00:33.259 --> 00:35.926
MICKEY: Hey, Shrub and Kelly.
(chuckles)

00:35.928 --> 00:37.519
Beth.

00:37.521 --> 00:40.205
Wow, look at you two together.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.523
We're buying decorations
for Beth's birthday party

00:41.525 --> 00:43.858
tomorrow.
It's a royal family theme.

00:43.860 --> 00:44.877
Pip-pip.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.603
Oh.

00:46.605 --> 00:48.863
Happy birthday.

00:48.865 --> 00:50.883
It's not today.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.776
I don't think.

00:52.778 --> 00:54.294
Beth's parents full-on think
the government's out

00:54.296 --> 00:55.629
to get them, okay?
So they, like,

00:55.631 --> 00:57.872
don't pay their taxes
and they hoard soup

00:57.874 --> 00:59.966
and all their kids were, like,
born in their barn

00:59.968 --> 01:01.952
with no birth certificate.

01:01.954 --> 01:03.562
Also, she was, like,
homeschooled,

01:03.564 --> 01:06.456
so she, like, knows things
like how to use a crossbow

01:06.458 --> 01:08.625
and the history
of the royal family.

01:08.627 --> 01:11.461
And, like, didn't know who
Oprah was until two years ago.

01:11.463 --> 01:15.223
Well, like, ha--happy birthday
whenever it is.

01:16.468 --> 01:19.078
Invite Shrub to your party,
Beth, this is pathetic.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.470
BETH: Oh, I didn't think
you'd wanna come.

01:20.472 --> 01:22.581
It's mostly just girls
and Mickey.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.158
I really actually don't even
know if I'm free, so...

01:25.160 --> 01:26.752
-He's free.
-Shut up.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.736
Well, it's from 2:00 to 4:00

01:28.738 --> 01:30.405
and everyone's gonna wear a hat

01:30.407 --> 01:33.408
because royals always wear hats
at parties.

01:33.410 --> 01:36.428
You're gonna take turns reading
from "Harry Potter"?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.181
Who's Harry Potter?

01:43.846 --> 01:44.937
Okay?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.179
No, no way.

01:46.181 --> 01:47.755
Why? It's a party and a hat
in one.

01:47.757 --> 01:49.349
You can put a bunch
of ginger ale right here,

01:49.351 --> 01:52.519
bag of pop rocks here.
Boom, party of one, mind blown.

01:52.521 --> 01:54.429
No, I need like a crown
or something.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.356
Like something better
than whatever freaking sad hat

01:56.358 --> 01:58.175
Mickey's gonna wear
to this party.

01:58.177 --> 02:00.268
Also, I need to get Beth
a super dope gift.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.528
Well, you can't get her
a decent education,

02:01.530 --> 02:03.347
'cause, yeah,
that ship has sailed.

02:03.349 --> 02:04.456
Oh, there's a craft store
in Dayton.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.440
I have to go there.

02:05.442 --> 02:06.941
What's the name
of that taxi guy?

02:06.943 --> 02:08.185
-Dick?
-Yes.

02:08.187 --> 02:09.611
He shut down.
He had a suspended license

02:09.613 --> 02:10.871
and a stolen car.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.373
-Why don't you have a car?
-Why don't you have a car?

02:13.375 --> 02:15.375
So Shrub doesn't even
have his license.

02:15.377 --> 02:16.802
He's failed the test
like three times.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.196
<i> The last time</i>
<i> he took the test,</i>

02:19.198 --> 02:21.456
uh, he ran over
this huge squirrel

02:21.458 --> 02:23.809
and it, like,
totally scarred him.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.720
And the testing guy.

02:26.722 --> 02:28.147
Oh, my God.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.731
-That's brilliant.
-Ow!

02:35.898 --> 02:38.157
So you'd like to start
a taxi service?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.325
High end rideshare company.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.660
Father, what you don't
understand about me

02:41.662 --> 02:44.571
is that I come from a long line
of business tycoons.

02:44.573 --> 02:46.665
My dad has
his Christmas tree farm,

02:46.667 --> 02:48.483
his corn maze,
and his mom

02:48.485 --> 02:50.318
ran a super successful
black market

02:50.320 --> 02:51.670
cigarette ring in prison.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.397
It's in my blood.

02:53.399 --> 02:56.583
I'm like an idiot savant,
but with business ideas.

02:56.585 --> 02:59.160
Like, here, give me an item
in this room.

02:59.162 --> 03:01.254
Um, this stapler.

03:01.256 --> 03:02.848
Mm...

03:02.850 --> 03:03.998
Pass.
Give me another.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.425
This paperweight.

03:05.427 --> 03:06.910
-Pass, another one.
-Why don't you just...

03:06.912 --> 03:08.002
tell me about your idea?

03:08.004 --> 03:10.597
Okay, thank you.
So, Flatch's lack

03:10.599 --> 03:12.265
of transportation options

03:12.267 --> 03:15.343
is a need that is waiting
to be exploited, by me.

03:15.345 --> 03:17.529
All that's missing is a vehicle
to exploit with.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.514
And you know no one else
with a car?

03:19.516 --> 03:23.109
Shrub's nan has a car, but
a stray cat gave birth in it

03:23.111 --> 03:25.929
last week,
and so it's out of commish

03:25.931 --> 03:27.039
until we get a wet vac.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.949
I'm just--I'm not sure
I'm comfortable

03:28.951 --> 03:30.375
lending you my car, Kelly.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.118
All right, I guess I have to go
back to selling my body

03:32.120 --> 03:34.104
-once again.
-You were a prostitute?

03:34.106 --> 03:35.605
Negatory.

03:35.607 --> 03:39.276
Medical center paid me to try
out their blood pressure cuffs.

03:39.278 --> 03:41.536
Okay, fine, you can use my car
for two hours a day,

03:41.538 --> 03:44.372
but no food inside,
no going over 40,

03:44.374 --> 03:46.225
and if I need it, you have
to bring it right back.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.726
And you'll pay me for that?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.436
I will not.

03:52.215 --> 03:54.474
Hey, Nadine, do you know
if the copier's broken?

03:54.476 --> 03:56.810
Um, do I look
like a copier technician?

03:56.812 --> 03:58.979
Oh, I don't know
what one looks like.

03:58.981 --> 04:00.555
Okay, well, it's not me,
Cheryl.

04:00.557 --> 04:02.557
Oh, gosh, with the lack
of stories to report on

04:02.559 --> 04:04.076
in Flatch,
I guess this broken copier

04:04.078 --> 04:05.969
is just gonna be my lead, huh?

04:05.971 --> 04:07.061
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

04:07.230 --> 04:09.414
I'm in a historical society
crisis right now.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.084
(sighs) Someone stole
the "Welcome to Flatch" sign.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.570
Oh, well, do tell.

04:15.572 --> 04:17.497
Okay, well,
it happens every year

04:17.499 --> 04:18.906
during "Pockton days."

04:18.908 --> 04:20.408
Someone from Pockton
comes over,

04:20.410 --> 04:22.210
they steal the town's sign,

04:22.212 --> 04:24.321
and I bet they think
they're so funny,

04:24.323 --> 04:25.580
but you know what's not funny?

04:25.582 --> 04:26.748
No.

04:26.767 --> 04:31.728
Going to prison for stealing
federal property.

04:33.665 --> 04:37.000
I think we have a crime.

04:37.002 --> 04:38.502
The Pockton rivalry,
it's been going on

04:38.504 --> 04:40.928
for centuries, ever
since Colonel Robert Flatch

04:40.930 --> 04:45.175
fought in the area in the 1800s
and then sold Pockton

04:45.177 --> 04:47.602
for a few apple seeds
and an orphan.

04:47.604 --> 04:51.348
Then he settled in Flatch.

04:51.350 --> 04:54.042
They're just very jealous.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.466
Huh, so you're starting
a cab company, huh?

05:01.468 --> 05:04.469
It's not a cab.
A rideshare experience.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.547
Oh, don't those
usually use apps?

05:07.549 --> 05:09.474
Like I know anyone
who could make an app.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.293
I could, but no biggie.
Next time.

05:12.295 --> 05:14.295
Ooh, I got to get
to the Post Office

05:14.297 --> 05:15.981
to pick up my custom hat
that just arrived from Etsy.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.298
Seriously?

05:17.300 --> 05:19.059
(sighs) Why does everyone care
about a party

05:19.061 --> 05:21.561
for the most boring girl
in the world?

05:21.563 --> 05:25.231
Beth is a complicated
and fascinating creature.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.326
I knew it.
You are into her.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.387
No need for worry, my bro.
We're just friends.

05:30.389 --> 05:33.073
Did I let her give me
a gel pedicure?

05:33.075 --> 05:35.876
Yes, I did.

05:35.878 --> 05:39.004
I am utterly smitten with Beth.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.659
It was Mickey's idea to do
the hats and the pedicure.

05:44.661 --> 05:47.512
I always wanted
a gay best friend.

05:51.093 --> 05:53.501
Very exciting day.
First day of Kuber.

05:53.503 --> 05:56.246
Okay, remember,
Beth's party starts at 2:00

05:56.248 --> 05:58.172
and I need a present
and my art supplies

05:58.174 --> 06:00.266
so I can make this sick hat.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.102
I call it King Trucker.

06:02.104 --> 06:05.030
Relax, I'll get you to Dayton.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.423
Man, it almost feels
like you like Beth

06:06.425 --> 06:09.851
more than your own cousin.

06:09.853 --> 06:12.204
(phone dings)

06:12.206 --> 06:14.431
First official ride call.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.691
Less drawing,
more customer service, okay?

06:16.693 --> 06:19.127
I need you on the switchboard.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.531
-Welcome to Kuber.
-Welcome to Kuber.

06:23.533 --> 06:24.549
Hi.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.128
Oh, I am so glad
that you guys are here.

06:28.130 --> 06:29.946
Where to, miss?

06:29.948 --> 06:31.631
Pockton, please.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.800
Why the hell would you ever
wanna go to that hell hole?

06:33.802 --> 06:35.285
They're our sworn
mortal enemies.

06:35.287 --> 06:36.895
-Yeah.
-Oh, come on.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.805
-This is so silly.
-Yeah?

06:38.807 --> 06:41.382
How about tell that
to our uncle Nugget, okay?

06:41.384 --> 06:44.294
Last time he crossed town lines
just to borrow a lawnmower

06:44.296 --> 06:45.812
he came back missing
two fingers.

06:45.814 --> 06:47.406
Yeah, and his pants.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.891
To be fair, he didn't have
pants on when he left,

06:49.893 --> 06:51.559
but that's not the point.

06:51.561 --> 06:55.989
Oh, you want gum?
Cheese cube? Water?

06:55.991 --> 06:57.657
Oh, no thanks.

06:57.659 --> 06:58.750
You sure?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.234
I--I can waterfall you
from here.

07:00.236 --> 07:03.088
I got perfect aim.
Check it.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.925
I haven't been in this car
in a long time.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.818
Oh, yeah, bet you
and Father Joe

07:08.820 --> 07:11.337
had a lot of, uh, adventures
in that backseat, huh?

07:11.339 --> 07:13.247
Stop, that's offensive.

07:13.249 --> 07:15.976
Please do not let that affect
your Yelp review.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.105
Okay, here we are.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.756
What? Where's the town?

07:21.758 --> 07:24.000
It's like a half a mile
that way.

07:24.002 --> 07:25.351
This is as far as I'll go.

07:25.353 --> 07:27.854
Too many enemies across
the line, okay?

07:27.856 --> 07:29.430
Oh, for heaven's sake.

07:29.432 --> 07:33.026
That'll be $20, minus your $1
first rider discount.

07:33.028 --> 07:35.370
Also, I have no change.

07:45.373 --> 07:47.281
Already headed
to our second call.

07:47.283 --> 07:49.450
Minus snacks,
we're up 10 bucks.

07:49.452 --> 07:51.118
That's what you call a success.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.955
Okay, reminder, the party
starts in two hours.

07:53.957 --> 07:57.124
I'm sorry, are you not enjoying
that blueberry frozen drink

07:57.126 --> 07:59.961
purchased with my earnings?
Perhaps you wanna speak to HR?

07:59.963 --> 08:01.963
Shut up, you are not
the boss of me.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.482
(inaudible)

08:07.154 --> 08:09.229
So, Big Mandy,
how's your day been going?

08:09.231 --> 08:11.397
I prefer not to talk
to drivers.

08:11.399 --> 08:14.493
Understood.
Customer's always right.

08:14.495 --> 08:19.039
Here.
Put this in.

09:49.481 --> 09:52.090
Mm-hmm, so you're saying
your sign, it went missing?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.259
Oh, I know, it sounds so silly.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.096
I mean, a rivalry between
two small towns? Why?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.414
(chuckles) Right?
Well, I doubt it was stolen.

10:00.416 --> 10:03.584
It's probably just some Flatch
kids getting into trouble,

10:03.586 --> 10:04.844
per usual.

10:05.088 --> 10:08.848
Actually, my sources say that
it happens every single year,

10:08.850 --> 10:10.275
and it is someone in Pockton.

10:10.277 --> 10:14.446
If someone from Pockton,
theoretically, stole your sign,

10:14.448 --> 10:18.858
I'd say you need to look far
and wide...

10:18.860 --> 10:20.267
mm-hmm...

10:20.269 --> 10:26.041
in, but outside, to find it.

10:30.446 --> 10:32.631
Is that a riddle?

10:32.633 --> 10:33.873
Is it?

10:33.875 --> 10:35.300
Okay.
(giggles)

10:35.302 --> 10:37.802
Yeah, I see what you're doing.
(laughs)

10:37.804 --> 10:38.970
-Yeah.
-You are playing

10:38.972 --> 10:40.697
right into this rivalry, huh?

10:40.699 --> 10:42.957
Why would I bother competing
against a sad rag

10:42.959 --> 10:45.201
with a circulation of 508

10:45.203 --> 10:47.646
when I've won
Best Regional Weekly...

10:50.041 --> 10:51.483
four years in a row now?

10:51.485 --> 10:54.152
Okey dokey, thank you
so much for your help.

10:54.154 --> 10:58.064
Mm-hmm, any time, Cheryl.

10:58.066 --> 11:00.307
I'm actually at 534 now.

11:00.309 --> 11:02.143
You got to get
your facts straight.

11:02.145 --> 11:05.330
It's a newspaper.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.167
All righty, ma'am.
That will be $15.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.319
I'm gonna do you a solid
and pay you in a tattoo.

11:12.321 --> 11:14.731
I'm doing an intro pricing
at $50 a pop.

11:14.733 --> 11:17.158
-Ah, I prefer cash.
-Yeah.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.584
I'm running a small business
here.

11:18.586 --> 11:21.996
Yeah, same here. I just paid
my tattoo kit off in full.

11:21.998 --> 11:23.573
Come on in, pick a design.

11:23.575 --> 11:25.666
-Yeah, no thanks.
-Yeah, we're, um,

11:25.668 --> 11:27.260
on a schedule right now, so...

11:27.262 --> 11:28.687
Yeah, well, some--
let's do it another time?

11:28.689 --> 11:29.837
Yeah.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.189
You don't think
I'd be any good at it?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.673
-I don't--are you se--?
-No.

11:32.675 --> 11:35.101
-I bet you're so good at it.
-I bet you're really good.

11:35.103 --> 11:37.570
All right, come on, let's go.

11:44.262 --> 11:46.596
Mm.

11:46.598 --> 11:48.373
These are really unique.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.709
I know, right?

11:50.711 --> 11:52.193
(clears throat, stammers)
Why don't you just, uh,

11:52.195 --> 11:53.953
pick that rose?

11:53.955 --> 11:55.380
Hmm?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.031
No, that's, uh...

11:57.033 --> 11:59.008
that's Zayn Malik
from One Direction.

12:00.128 --> 12:02.554
My tattoo art
is heavily influenced

12:02.556 --> 12:06.799
by Keith Haring,
Basquiat,

12:06.801 --> 12:11.045
and that little elephant
they taught to paint.

12:11.047 --> 12:13.047
With a little brush.

12:13.049 --> 12:15.382
-You like The Rock?
-Yeah.

12:15.384 --> 12:19.128
I got a design of him riding
Jimmy Fallon like a bull.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.387
We can do that.

12:20.389 --> 12:22.273
Yeah, sure, that one
would definitely take

12:22.275 --> 12:23.742
like a really long time,
though,

12:23.744 --> 12:25.226
-so maybe something smaller?
-Yeah, we don't really have--

12:25.228 --> 12:30.397
-Yeah.
-No, no, no, ten minutes, tops.

12:30.399 --> 12:32.233
As a female running
a small business,

12:32.235 --> 12:34.477
I've, like, an obligation
to support

12:34.479 --> 12:37.630
other female-run
small businesses.

12:39.909 --> 12:43.836
And when a female-run tattoo
removal shop opens,

12:43.838 --> 12:45.930
I'm gonna support them too.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.265
Just drop me off here.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.492
I'll--I'll take the bus
to Dayton.

12:49.494 --> 12:51.844
I'm gonna remember you
abandoning the business

12:51.846 --> 12:53.104
just as it was taking off,
okay?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.664
-Oh.
-No stock options for you.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.757
-Aw.
-You just lost out on billions,

12:56.759 --> 12:58.259
bro.
Billions.

12:58.261 --> 13:00.278
Billions.
Yeah, well, guess what.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.339
I'm done with you, Jackie Chan.

13:03.341 --> 13:07.935
It's Jackie Chain
from<i> Dragon Lord.</i>

13:07.937 --> 13:09.846
That--those are
teeny little feet,

13:09.848 --> 13:12.373
doing a backflip.

13:16.445 --> 13:20.540
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

13:20.542 --> 13:21.874
Fargas?

13:21.876 --> 13:23.526
No, Far--Far--Fargas.

13:23.528 --> 13:24.803
Fargas, no!

13:24.805 --> 13:28.097
No! Fargas!
No!

13:28.099 --> 13:30.016
Damn it!

13:40.469 --> 13:42.270
You understand you're gonna
have to start back

13:42.272 --> 13:43.804
in the training program now.

13:43.806 --> 13:46.507
Shut up.

13:46.509 --> 13:47.900
Oh, my God, Kelly.

13:47.902 --> 13:51.162
Look at this cringey music
Father Joe jams to.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.056
-A-Men?
-(chuckles)

13:53.058 --> 13:55.316
It's like some cheesy
church [bleep].

13:55.318 --> 13:57.001
That's him,
with the Bieber hair.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.169
-That's Father Joe!
-Oh, my God.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.838
-Put it in! Put it in!
-Shut up!

13:59.840 --> 14:02.131

14:08.331 --> 14:10.573

14:10.575 --> 14:12.833
spiritual boy band
in the late '90s.

14:12.835 --> 14:15.669
We were huge in Germany.

14:15.671 --> 14:17.355
Yeah, that's me.

But of course,
it was the Big Guy

14:23.697 --> 14:26.513

14:26.515 --> 14:29.592
Yeah, we, uh--we did
a mega church tour.

14:29.594 --> 14:33.371
We were very popular
on the sweet 16 party circuit.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.023

Father, just so you know,
your selfish need

18:06.586 --> 18:08.402
to visit a parishioner
has kept me from the woman

18:08.404 --> 18:09.478
that I love.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.422
Oh, I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

-Yeah, well, I do.
-He doesn't, okay?

18:13.501 --> 18:16.152
He lusts after Beth
and she doesn't know he exists.

18:16.154 --> 18:17.244
-Shut up.
-Well, then you need

18:17.246 --> 18:18.596
to show her that you exist,

18:18.598 --> 18:21.173
take your light from
underneath your bushel.

18:21.175 --> 18:23.101
Yeah.

on growing her ferns

18:33.020 --> 18:34.946
so close to my property line,

18:34.948 --> 18:37.615
it would be her job
to trim them.

-I see.
-And she hasn't.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.102
And don't get me started
on her invasive sumac.

18:42.104 --> 18:44.180
Oh, we won't.

18:44.182 --> 18:46.198
It's like living
in<i> The Jungle Book.</i>

18:46.200 --> 18:47.533
June, I thought you said
this was an emergency.

18:47.535 --> 18:50.536
I wrote her a note
and left it on her door,

18:50.538 --> 18:52.355
and she won't respond.

18:52.357 --> 18:54.857
Let me take care of this.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.089
You missed the soiree
of the century.

19:44.091 --> 19:45.832
-MICKEY: (chuckles)
-MANDY: Hey!

19:45.834 --> 19:47.092
Jackie Chan!

19:47.094 --> 19:49.020
I need another ride.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.930
I can't hear you.
No one's in the car.

19:50.932 --> 19:53.916
I need another ride.

19:53.918 --> 19:54.917
-What's wrong?
-Hey!

19:55.086 --> 19:56.435
Kelly's gonna get
another crappy tattoo.

19:56.437 --> 19:59.422
You got to be kidding me.
Are you serious?

19:59.424 --> 20:01.757
(engine starts, tires squeal)

20:01.759 --> 20:02.867
Squirrel!

20:02.869 --> 20:04.994
(tires squeal)

20:11.860 --> 20:13.085
What is that?

20:14.439 --> 20:17.215
So Kelly had to buy Beth's dad
a new mailbox

20:17.217 --> 20:21.368
and also replace the bumper
on Father Joe's car.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.630
She's working that part off
by mowing the church lawn.

20:24.632 --> 20:27.725
Levi, does that look like
a straight line to you?

20:27.727 --> 20:32.379
Are we gonna need some more
performance reviews, people?

20:32.381 --> 20:33.547
KELLY: What do people have?
Grass.

20:33.549 --> 20:35.215
What do they need?

20:35.217 --> 20:36.809
Someone to cut it.
What do I have?

20:36.811 --> 20:38.236
Business sense.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.464
Welcome to Mallet's Mowers,
yard and field maintenance.

20:41.466 --> 20:43.482
But we're only open
from 4:00 to 5:00 p.m.

20:43.484 --> 20:44.742
after school.

20:44.986 --> 20:47.411
We don't provide the lawnmower.
That's on the customer.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.730
Also, we shut down
in the summer.

20:49.732 --> 20:50.564
Too hot.

20:50.566 --> 20:51.749
<i> SHRUB: Check it out.</i>

20:51.751 --> 20:54.143
<i> I stole June's cookies</i>
<i> and her napkin</i>

20:54.145 --> 20:56.671
<i> and made this.</i>

21:02.262 --> 21:04.095
(grunts)

21:07.675 --> 21:09.558
No!

21:11.345 --> 21:13.771
No.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.774
Those aren't yours.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.027
(panting)

21:23.691 --> 21:25.783
No!

21:25.785 --> 21:28.661
God.
