00:04.210 --> 00:06.000
Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:06.000 --> 00:09.500
Andi: Bex had me watch this
super scary movie last night.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.500
A mother's number one job
is to keep their child safe.

00:12.500 --> 00:15.080
-Shh!

00:15.080 --> 00:16.290
What did you do?
Wh-- What's going on?

00:16.290 --> 00:18.250
I got you a lesson,
that's your present.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.330
-No, no.
-Yeah!

00:19.330 --> 00:21.420
I love that you
have groupies.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.000
Why did you
do this to me?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.080
Do what?
What did I do?

00:24.080 --> 00:25.580
I'm not sure
she's safe with you.

00:25.580 --> 00:28.830
That is not your decision
to make. I'm her mother!

00:28.830 --> 00:30.670
Andi: She won't even let
me eat a Toaster Tart.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.250
I'm gonna have one
right now.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.460
Oh, no. Don't.
I ran... out.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.210
This is my dad,
isn't it?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.460
Say something.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.710
Is this my dad?

00:44.710 --> 00:45.790
No.

00:45.790 --> 00:47.170
Then who is it?

00:47.170 --> 00:48.380
Nobody.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.380
You don't put nobody
in a Toaster Tart box.

00:51.380 --> 00:54.120
You told me that you took
my dad's picture out,

00:54.120 --> 00:56.540
and then I find
this picture that you hid.

00:56.540 --> 00:59.500
Nobody... is somebody.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.290
Who is it?

-(rips)
-See? Nobody.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.920
Oh, who wants
pizza? I do.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.290
That's very dramatic.

01:10.290 --> 01:14.460
But now I know for a fact
that he is somebody.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.290
Because you bring up pizza

01:16.290 --> 01:19.580
every time you don't
wanna answer my questions.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.960

I ran into a glass door!

02:32.330 --> 02:33.420
Again?

02:33.420 --> 02:35.670
A different one.
Much more painful.

02:35.670 --> 02:37.670
Then why are you so happy?

02:37.670 --> 02:40.380
Adrenaline and shock.

02:40.380 --> 02:42.620
Which is starting
to wear off.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.210
Ow!

02:44.210 --> 02:45.580
That really hurts!

02:45.580 --> 02:47.420
It's sting-y!

02:47.420 --> 02:49.040
He ran into a glass door.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.080
-Oh.
-(groans)

02:52.170 --> 02:54.170
They're all
staring at you.

03:00.420 --> 03:03.380
Actually, they're
staring at you.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.920
Oh, no.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.210
What is it?
Toilet paper?

03:10.210 --> 03:12.210
Toothpaste?
Wardrobe malfunction?

03:12.210 --> 03:13.670
Is there a cliff-hanger?

03:13.670 --> 03:14.880
You're clean.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.330
Um... I don't know
if this might be related,

03:17.330 --> 03:20.420
but I might've possibly
mentioned to my mom

03:20.420 --> 03:21.880
about Bex being your mom.

03:23.380 --> 03:26.420
-Cyrus?
-You knew it was a secret!

03:26.420 --> 03:28.420
Look, it was hard enough
for you just to tell us,

03:28.420 --> 03:31.380
and you shouldn't have to go
through that over and over again.

03:31.380 --> 03:33.670
People were gonna
find out eventually.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.120
But your mom
is the biggest gossip.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.540
She probably told everyone.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.790
She definitely told everyone.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.170
Sent out an email blast
and boom! It's done.

03:42.170 --> 03:43.420
The hard part is over!

03:43.420 --> 03:45.790
The hard part is just beginning.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.380
I'm sorry, Andi.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.380
Boy, is my face half red.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.170
'Cause... 'Cause I ran
into the-- Never mind.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.460
Oh, no.
Here comes Jonah.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.620
Hey, guys.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.750
What am I supposed to do?
Where am I supposed to go?

04:04.750 --> 04:07.620
Earth, can you please
just open up and swallow me?

04:08.830 --> 04:10.210
He's coming over.

04:11.290 --> 04:13.540
-(sighs) Hi, Jonah.
-Hey.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.380
Your-Your mom thing.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.750
-You heard.
-Yeah.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.329
-That's so awesome.
-It is?

04:20.329 --> 04:22.170
I'm so boring
compared to you.

04:22.170 --> 04:24.880
You're so not boring
compared to everyone.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.580
Can... Can I take
a selfie with you?

04:26.580 --> 04:28.210
Uh...

04:30.290 --> 04:32.210
Yeah... sure.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.170
You're welcome.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.500
-Celia!
-Lillian.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.580
You're very devoted
to this color.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.710
But I guess it's safer to just
stick with what you know.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.290
Get to the point, Lillian.

04:54.290 --> 04:56.330
I see your older daughter
is home.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.960
Yes, she is.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.080
Did I say older?
I meant only.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.380
I hear that little cutie
with the Harry Potter haircut

05:03.380 --> 05:08.080
is actually her daughter, and not
your late-in-life miracle baby.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.290
I guess congratulations
are in order.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.210
Grandma.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.290
(screaming)
Watch out!

05:17.290 --> 05:20.170
Oh, dear!
How did that happen?

05:20.170 --> 05:21.920
You're so petty!

05:21.920 --> 05:23.040

-Us?

it was awesome!

Oh, so, you're not mad
at me anymore, right?

Well, I'm not mad at you
right now.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.750
I'll... take it.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.170
I can't believe
you told him.

06:05.170 --> 06:08.460
I didn't. Cyrus told his
mom, so now it's out.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.330
Everyone knows.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.670
Everyone?

06:11.670 --> 06:13.330
As in everyone?

06:13.330 --> 06:16.580
Yeah. In fact, kids at school
who never talked to me

06:16.580 --> 06:19.170
were all like, "Cool!"
and "You're so brave!"

06:19.170 --> 06:21.920
Two of them even gave me
numbers for their shrinks.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.750
It's going straight
to voice mail.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.290
-Who are you calling?
-Mom.

06:25.290 --> 06:28.500
We gotta get home.
Brittany?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
Hi. I have an emergency.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.880
I know I've only been here
a week, but I promise you,

06:32.880 --> 06:34.500
-I'll never ask this--
-Go.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.710
-Really?
-Yes.

06:36.710 --> 06:37.750
Thank you!

06:37.750 --> 06:39.330
Let's go.

06:39.330 --> 06:40.750
Okay.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.830
Hey, guys.

06:51.830 --> 06:53.620
Everything okay, Mom?

06:53.620 --> 06:54.790
What's with the luggage?

06:54.790 --> 06:56.330
Uh, we're gettin' away.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.670
Your father seems to think
I'm a menace to society.

06:58.670 --> 07:02.080
Not society,
just a 10-block radius.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.290
What happened?

07:03.290 --> 07:06.540
Well, your mother...
engaged with a neighbor.

07:06.540 --> 07:10.040
I was attacked. And my garden
hose only reaches so far.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.750
Okay, uh...
we should get going.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.420
I'm trusting you.

07:16.420 --> 07:17.290
Thank you.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.920
I don't want to,
but your father's forcing me.

07:27.960 --> 07:32.500
Well, kid...
it's just you and me.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.500
We could do...
whatever we want.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.290
You got any ideas?

07:38.290 --> 07:40.830
We could have dinner...

07:40.830 --> 07:42.500
in the living room...

07:42.500 --> 07:44.330
while we watch TV!

07:45.330 --> 07:47.500
And each have two desserts!

07:47.500 --> 07:49.670
Okay, yeah, we could do that.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.790
But think bigger.

07:51.790 --> 07:56.330
Scratch the dinner!
We'll just have dessert!

07:56.330 --> 07:58.330
Okay, do you realize
what just happened?

07:58.330 --> 08:00.080
Mom and Dad are gone!

08:00.080 --> 08:01.830
I'm in charge!

08:04.960 --> 08:07.460
Andi, don't you get it?
We could have a party!

08:13.580 --> 08:15.710
I don't think
this is a good idea.

08:15.710 --> 08:17.290
Look,
you're getting older,

08:17.290 --> 08:20.040
and there are some basic life
skills you need to learn.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.460
One of them
is giving a party.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.120
Will I get
a merit badge?

08:24.120 --> 08:28.540
Yes. As a matter of fact, you are
fulfilling your responsibility

08:28.540 --> 08:31.670
to kids whose parents
are not going out of town.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.250
Ooh, look.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.380
(laughing)

08:40.380 --> 08:41.289
Brittany.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.080
Was this your emergency?

08:43.080 --> 08:44.290
You had to have a party?

08:44.290 --> 08:46.460
Kind of? I can explain.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.040
Don't bother.
The whole mom thing?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.290
Crazy.
I just heard.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.420
Was that that guy that used to come
over when you were babysitting?

08:53.420 --> 08:55.670
What guy?
There was no guy.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.290
Is this her?

08:58.290 --> 09:00.790
-Hi! I'm Brittany.
-Andi.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.710
(sighs)
She's precious.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.960
Those glasses over there, they're great.
We just got them in.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.040
Ooh. I love them.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.500
And blacklight paint,
obviously.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.250
Uh-huh.
Here ya go.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.830
A Ninja costume?

09:16.830 --> 09:19.040
Yeah. Never hurts
to have one on hand.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.620
You're gonna need
air freshener.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.040
What do you think?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.500
I think it's gonna make
a huge mess.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.210
We'll take 20.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.670

09:54.620 --> 09:56.460
Do I look okay?

09:56.460 --> 09:57.960
You look okay.

-You look amazing!
-So do you!

Door's open.
