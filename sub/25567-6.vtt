00:25.066 --> 00:29.070
I don't want marriage
with a second-hand cake or fiancé, Dodoi.

Calm down. Don't stress out.
It was just a joke.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.452
Stop, Dodoi. The kids are up already.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.997
So what? What's the problem?
They don't know how they were made?

00:39.080 --> 00:43.501
It's one thing to know, my dear.
Another thing is a live reenactment. OK?

00:44.085 --> 00:48.381
Either way, I really think that
what happened yesterday was a mistake.

00:48.465 --> 00:51.342
A mistake? Your face didn't look
like it was a mistake.

-Samantha, I tried really hard.

00:55.263 --> 00:58.433
No! Not like that.
It was out of the blue, you know?

00:58.516 --> 00:59.851
How do I tell the kids?

00:59.934 --> 01:02.187
Yesterday I was engaged.
Today, Dad and Mom...

01:02.270 --> 01:04.063
Why can't we be honest with them?

01:04.147 --> 01:06.524
Mom and Dad are doing it
to try and figure things out!

Having kids has nothing to do
with honesty.

-No! I didn't forget!

Fine. Let's go!
Let's find that other Plimplom.

Especially as I don't want
to look at your face again!

11:23.682 --> 11:26.352

it's going to be hard to find this one.

He's fine, he's coming, he's just making
an emergency call to his psychiatrist.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.892
What did you do to them, Samantha?

12:06.976 --> 12:09.603
Do I start with the physical
or psychological abuse?

12:09.687 --> 12:11.313
-But is he coming?
-Oh, yeah.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.567

12:19.697 --> 12:23.033
Well, Dr. Tereza said that I'm stable

12:23.117 --> 12:25.911
and that, in fact, this trip might be good

12:25.995 --> 12:28.581

that I've overcome my obsession

Sorry, those were just her words, got it?
For me, it was just a great love.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.383
Does anyone have a plastic bag for Tico?

12:39.467 --> 12:42.136
It's not necessary, Samantha.
I don't do that anymore.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.679
I'm a new man now.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.639
-[Samantha] Mm-hmm.
-Do what?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.019
Tico, what is your biggest dream?

12:50.102 --> 12:53.522
To be honest, my biggest dream
is getting a kiss from you.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.776
How cute! Close your eyes, Tico.

This is jealousy!

You're all jealous of me.
That's why this crappy group ended!

13:20.382 --> 13:22.593
No, no. The group ended because you left.

13:22.676 --> 13:26.055
This is your specialty, right, Samantha?
Abandoning others.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.892

Samantha has changed.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.270
-She's a good mother and partner.
-[Alfonso] Samantha's a good partner?

13:33.354 --> 13:36.774
-[Alfonso] Why did you break up with her?
-I broke up with him!

13:36.857 --> 13:38.776
You haven't signed the divorce papers.

13:38.859 --> 13:42.112

Man, you must be suffering in that house!

-No, he isn't. He has a bed in my room!
-How pathetic!

-It's temporary, but we're working on it.
-Working on it, how?

At least Dodoi is not a loser

Porky, can't you see that it's you
that's causing the animosity in this car?

14:06.887 --> 14:09.765
It's like Dodoi said.
I've changed, I've matured.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.935
I now know how to appreciate others
and recognize my flaws.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.353
That's not what I said.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.981
You've always used everyone
and then threw them out!

14:17.064 --> 14:19.525
That's what you've always done!
Give me the bag!

Truth is, I can't wait
to get out of that room

so we can pick up where we left off.

I can't believe it! The Plimploms!

23:22.192 --> 23:23.568
What's this?

23:23.652 --> 23:27.030
May I? I'll post it on Instagram!
Are you guys back together?

23:27.114 --> 23:31.076
-Are you doing a show in this theater?
-What theater?

23:31.159 --> 23:33.745
Don't you remember?
This is the Big Sweep Theater!

23:36.456 --> 23:37.874
[Samantha] Oh my...

23:41.378 --> 23:43.004
[Tico] Look what I found here!

23:43.922 --> 23:45.465
-[Samantha] No way!
-Look!

23:46.091 --> 23:48.343
-Tico!
-[Tico] Our first concert was here!

23:48.426 --> 23:50.262
[Alfonso] It was here we did our worst...

23:50.345 --> 23:53.974
Yes, this place went broke
and ended up like this.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.520
I still remember the smell of popcorn.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.275
Try not to fall over me next time.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.279
-It's not my fault Tico messed up.
-Samantha kept staring at me!

24:11.032 --> 24:16.496
What's with the sad faces?
You're just starting out!

24:16.580 --> 24:18.248
You've had one bad day!

24:18.790 --> 24:23.503
What matters is to never stop believing!

24:25.088 --> 24:27.340
Old bastard!

24:27.424 --> 24:28.717
I miss him.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.678
[laughing] We laughed so hard that day!

24:32.179 --> 24:36.057
You don't miss those times, Alfonso?
Porky was loved!

24:36.141 --> 24:38.435
People wanted to grab you,
smell you, hug you!

24:38.518 --> 24:40.937
It was real, like your VCR tapes.

24:41.021 --> 24:44.733
Yeah, for sure, nowadays parents
don't let children come close to me!

24:44.816 --> 24:47.736
We'd argue and argue.
But we were a family, right?

24:47.819 --> 24:51.573
[crying] Let's scatter the ashes!
Let's do it!

24:51.656 --> 24:55.744
[crying] So beautiful!
I'm very emotional too!

24:55.827 --> 24:59.372
You still haven't left, woman? Leave!
This is a family affair! Intimate!

24:59.456 --> 25:01.875
That's right! You lunatic! Piss off!

25:01.958 --> 25:03.418

25:05.503 --> 25:06.671
[Samantha] Shit!

25:13.803 --> 25:15.639
[sighing]

25:18.516 --> 25:19.726
On three?

25:19.809 --> 25:21.937
-On three.
-Let's do it.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.065
[together] One, two, three.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.610

-[Samantha] Oh, damn!

25:29.069 --> 25:32.239
[spitting and coughing]

25:32.781 --> 25:35.158
-This is pepper!
-Black pepper!

25:35.242 --> 25:37.953
He was using a lot of stuff.
Never mind, let's not judge!

-I'll call you later.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.682
Boys, would you mind
going to a meeting with me?

25:58.765 --> 26:01.393
I have an invitation for you.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.230
-Shall we?
-Yeah, let's go...

26:05.313 --> 26:07.315
Juninho! Let's start this barbecue.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.942
I'll bring the booze!
