11:47.107 --> 11:48.979
YEAH, HE MIGHT FLUNK.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.042
WELL, THAT´S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

11:52.042 --> 11:54.484
WE´LL WORK WITH MAX EVERY
NIGHT IF THAT´S WHAT IT TAKES.

11:54.484 --> 11:56.747
THAT´S RIGHT. HE´S NOT
GONNA FAIL THE FIFTH GRADE.

11:56.747 --> 11:59.750
NO ONE IN MY FAMILY HAS EVER
FAILED THE FIFTH GRADE.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.893
IF THIS WAS THE SIXTH GRADE
OR THE SEVENTH...

12:02.893 --> 12:04.424
OR A SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT,

12:04.424 --> 12:07.197
WE´D BE HAVING
A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

12:07.197 --> 12:08.759
BUT THIS IS THE FIFTH GRADE,
DAMN IT,

12:08.759 --> 12:10.400
AND THIS IS WHERE
THE LOPEZES SHINE.

12:10.400 --> 12:12.462
AND IF YOU DON´T BELIEVE ME,
SABES QUé, RED HAIR?

12:12.462 --> 12:14.765
I´LL TAKE THAT --
GEORGE!

12:20.370 --> 12:23.343
MAX, GET DOWN HERE!

12:23.343 --> 12:26.046
NOW IT MAKES SENSE WHY MAX
WAS ACTING THIS WAY --

12:26.046 --> 12:27.317
WHY HE MOUTHED OFF
TO BENNY.

12:27.317 --> 12:29.980
HOW DID I NOT
SEE THIS COMING?

12:29.980 --> 12:31.421
MAYBE I WAS
WORKING TOO MUCH.

12:31.421 --> 12:33.383
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ON TOP OF THIS.

12:33.383 --> 12:35.986
WELL, I´M GLAD YOU SAID THAT,
´CAUSE COMING FROM ME,

12:35.986 --> 12:37.888
THAT MIGHT HAVE
SOUNDED UGLY.

12:39.389 --> 12:41.832
MAX, WHAT´S THIS?

12:44.094 --> 12:47.067
IT´S A PIECE OF PAPER
WITH MOM´S SIGNATURE.

12:48.238 --> 12:53.203
OH, NO! I´M FALLING BEHIND
ACADEMICALLY!

12:55.105 --> 12:58.208
WHY DIDN´T YOU SHOW ME
THIS NOTE?

12:59.910 --> 13:02.052
CUT THE CRAP.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.453
WE JUST MET
WITH MRS. REYNOLDS,

13:03.453 --> 13:06.056
AND SHE SAID YOU´RE BEHIND
IN ALL YOUR SCHOOLWORK,

13:06.056 --> 13:07.988
AND THAT
YOU´RE NOT EVEN TRYING.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.389
MAX, IF YOUR GRADES
DON´T IMPROVE,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.421
THEY´RE GONNA
HOLD YOU BACK A YEAR.

13:11.421 --> 13:12.562
SO?

13:12.562 --> 13:14.064
YOU´LL LOSE
ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.495
THEY´LL ALL MOVE ON.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.999
I WON´T LOSE MY FRIENDS.
THEY THINK I´M FUNNY.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.071
WELL THEN, YOU SHOULD KEEP
FAILING AND FAILING,

13:21.071 --> 13:22.833
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT´S
REALLY HILARIOUS?

13:22.833 --> 13:26.376
AN 80-YEAR-OLD FIFTH GRADER
TRYING TO PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK.

13:26.376 --> 13:28.008
LOOK...

13:28.008 --> 13:30.280
THIS IS A CONTRACT
FROM YOUR TEACHER.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.013
IT SAYS YOU PROMISE TO WORK HARD
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR,

13:33.013 --> 13:34.885
AND WE WANT YOU
TO SIGN IT.

13:34.885 --> 13:36.146
BUT I DON´T
CARE ABOUT SCHOOL.

13:36.146 --> 13:37.888
I SHOULDN´T EVEN
HAVE TO GO.

13:37.888 --> 13:39.249
DON´T WALK AWAY
FROM ME.

13:39.249 --> 13:41.021
YOU ARE GOING TO
SIGN THIS CONTRACT,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.123
AND THEN YOU´RE GONNA
START DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.525
WHAT´S THE POINT?
IT´S TOO HARD!

13:45.525 --> 13:47.097
WHAT´S THE POINT?
WH --

13:47.097 --> 13:49.129
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

13:52.002 --> 13:54.064
LOOK...

13:54.064 --> 13:56.606
I KNOW SCHOOL´S HARD,
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO GO.

13:56.606 --> 13:58.108
WHY?

13:58.108 --> 14:00.170
BECAUSE WHAT KIND OF JOB
ARE YOU GONNA GET

14:00.170 --> 14:01.441
IF YOU DON´T GO TO SCHOOL?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.443
I COULD BE
A PRO SKATEBOARDER.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.345
REALLY?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.178
´CAUSE I DON´T SEE A LOT OF PRO
SKATERS COMING INTO THE HOUSE

14:08.178 --> 14:10.420
SAYING "MOMMY, MY ELBOW --
KISS IT!"

14:10.420 --> 14:12.282
OKAY...

14:12.282 --> 14:15.155
BUT I COULD STILL WORK
AT A SKATE SHOP.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.157
SO YOU MAKE A COUPLE
HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH.

14:17.157 --> 14:21.161
A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS?
THAT´S AWESOME!

14:22.632 --> 14:25.565
I MEAN, I COULD GET
A COOL CAR, A BIG HOUSE...

14:25.565 --> 14:28.598
YOU CAN´T GET A CAR
AND A HOUSE ON YOUR SALARY.

14:28.598 --> 14:32.072
I MEAN, YOU COULD IF YOU MOVED
INTO A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.945
THEN I´LL LIVE
IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:34.945 --> 14:37.908
OOH, BUT THEY JUST
STOLE YOUR CAR.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.109
NO WAY.

14:39.109 --> 14:40.480
YOU COULD
RUN AFTER ´EM.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.611
YEAH, I´LL GET IT BACK.

14:41.611 --> 14:44.414
OOH, MAN,
YOU JUST GOT SHOT.

14:45.956 --> 14:49.119
DAD, I KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING,
BUT YOU´RE NOT GONNA TRICK ME.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.091
I´M NEVER GONNA
BE GOOD AT SCHOOL.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.222
I´M JUST STUPID!

14:52.222 --> 14:54.164
LOOK -- YOU ARE
NOT STUPID!

14:54.164 --> 14:56.166
YOU HAVE
A LEARNING DISABILITY.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.198
LOOK -- I KNOW
WHAT YOU´RE GOING THROUGH.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.529
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL,

14:59.529 --> 15:01.471
I REMEMBER TAKING TESTS
AND JUST SITTING THERE,

15:01.471 --> 15:03.203
BECAUSE I DIDN´T
UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.475
AND I HAD TO WORK TWICE
AS HARD AS THE OTHER KIDS

15:05.475 --> 15:07.037
JUST TO GET BY.

15:07.037 --> 15:08.638
AND I COULD HAVE DROPPED OUT,
BUT I DIDN´T.

15:08.638 --> 15:11.481
BECAUSE NO ONE IN OUR FAMILY HAD
EVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

15:11.481 --> 15:13.383
AND I WANTED
TO BE THE FIRST ONE.

15:13.383 --> 15:15.015
AND I WAS!

15:15.015 --> 15:18.348
GEE...SO IF I WORK HARD
AND GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL,

15:18.348 --> 15:22.292
I CAN GET SOME LOSER JOB
AT A FACTORY LIKE YOU?

15:25.956 --> 15:29.359
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON´T CARE.

15:29.359 --> 15:32.102
ALL RIGHT,
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

15:32.102 --> 15:34.364
I GIVE UP ON YOU.

15:46.176 --> 15:49.479
HEY, MAX.
GOT A MINUTE?

15:49.479 --> 15:52.052
PEOPLE KNOW I´M OUT HERE.

15:59.589 --> 16:03.593
LISTEN, IF YOU HADN´T MOUTHED
OFF, I WOULDN´T HAVE HIT YOU.

16:03.593 --> 16:06.396
WELL, THAT´S THE WAY
I WAS RAISED, OKAY?

16:06.396 --> 16:09.069
THINGS
WERE DIFFERENT THEN.

16:09.069 --> 16:13.403
WHAT WE CALLED "DISCIPLINE"
IS NOW CHILD ABUSE.

16:19.609 --> 16:24.484
KEEPING AN EYE ON YOUR MAN...
IS NOW STALKING.

16:27.217 --> 16:30.760
HELL, BACK THEN,
"NO" MEANT "YES."

16:30.760 --> 16:34.764
WELL, AT LEAST IT DID
TO ME. [ LAUGHS ]

16:34.764 --> 16:36.766
OKAY, NEVER MIND.

16:38.228 --> 16:41.771
I GUESS WHAT
I´M TRYING TO SAY IS...

16:48.678 --> 16:52.182
HERE´S A 20 --
ARE WE COOL?

16:53.383 --> 16:57.487
YEAH, WE´RE COOL.
I´M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID.

16:57.487 --> 17:02.052
AH, FORGET IT.
WE ALL SAY STUPID THINGS.

17:02.052 --> 17:03.193
HEY, GRANDMA?

17:03.193 --> 17:04.454
YEAH?

17:04.454 --> 17:07.797
DID YOUR DAD EVER SAY
HE GAVE UP ON YOU?

17:09.629 --> 17:11.531
WHERE´D THAT COME FROM?

17:11.531 --> 17:17.507
I´M MESSING UP IN SCHOOL, AND
DAD SAID HE´S GIVING UP ON ME.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.339
WOW.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.212
YOU KNOW, MY DAD MIGHT HAVE
BEAT ME LIKE AN OLD BLANKET,

17:22.212 --> 17:25.175
BUT HE NEVER
GAVE UP ON ME.

17:27.517 --> 17:31.081
THAT IS COLD, DUDE.

17:34.254 --> 17:39.058
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER.

17:45.835 --> 17:47.737
Angie: GEORGE!

17:47.737 --> 17:49.339
YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.

17:49.339 --> 17:51.171
YEAH, I KNOW.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.702
THE SKY IS PINK,
ORANGE, AND RED.

17:52.702 --> 17:54.344
IT´S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
SUNSET EVER.

17:54.344 --> 17:57.607
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
I´M WATCHING A HOCKEY FIGHT.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.249
IT´S MAX.

17:59.249 --> 18:00.480
WHAT NOW?

18:00.480 --> 18:02.352
COME ON.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.362
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:12.362 --> 18:14.364
MY HOMEWORK.

18:14.364 --> 18:15.495
YEAH?

18:15.495 --> 18:18.798
I´M NOT GONNA BE
HELD BACK.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.431
DON´T GIVE UP ON ME.

18:21.431 --> 18:23.433
OH, MAN.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.675
LOOK, MAX,
I´M SORRY I SAID THAT.

18:25.675 --> 18:27.707
OKAY, I WAS ANGRY.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.310
I´D NEVER GIVE UP
ON YOU, SON.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.613
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

18:36.546 --> 18:39.249
NOW SIGN THIS
LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT.

18:43.293 --> 18:46.296
YOU KNOW, I STILL HATE SCHOOL,
BUT I´M NOT GONNA LET YOU DOWN.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.198
WE´RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU DOWN, EITHER.

18:48.198 --> 18:50.260
´CAUSE A FAMILY´S ONLY
AS SMART AS ITS DUMBEST CHILD,

18:50.260 --> 18:52.162
SO LET´S MAKE THAT
CARMEN AGAIN.

18:53.603 --> 18:54.734
HEY!

18:54.734 --> 18:57.367
QUIET!
I´M TEACHING HERE.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.610
AND WE´RE GONNA HELP YOU OUT,
´CAUSE IF YOU FAIL, WE FAIL.

19:00.610 --> 19:02.412
I´M GONNA
CHANGE MY SCHEDULE.

19:02.412 --> 19:04.414
I´LL WORK WITH YOU AFTER SCHOOL
ON MONDAYS AND TUESDAYS.

19:04.414 --> 19:07.447
AND WEDNESDAYS, I CAN BLOW OFF
HAPPY HOUR AT THIRSTY´S

19:07.447 --> 19:09.819
AND COME STRAIGHT HOME
TO HELP.

19:09.819 --> 19:13.383
YOU GO TO HAPPY HOUR
AT THIRSTY´S?

19:13.383 --> 19:17.257
IF YOU´RE GONNA USE THAT TONE,
YOU´RE DAMN RIGHT I DON´T!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.192
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, MOM?

19:22.192 --> 19:25.435
OH, RELAX. WE´RE A BIG,
HAPPY FAMILY AGAIN.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.467
MAX AND I ARE FINE.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.399
DID SHE APOLOGIZE
TO YOU?

19:31.201 --> 19:32.842
NO.

19:32.842 --> 19:35.405
BUT SHE GAVE ME
20 REASONS TO GET OVER IT.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.413
YOU JUST PAID HIM OFF?

19:43.413 --> 19:45.315
YEP.

19:45.315 --> 19:49.359
YOU CAN´T DO THAT!
YOU CAN´T JUST BUY FAMILY.

19:49.359 --> 19:52.362
ALL THOSE CELEBRITY
LESBIANS DO IT.

19:54.324 --> 19:56.626
OKAY, IF YOU PAY HIM
$20 A HIT,

19:56.626 --> 19:58.968
YOU MUST OWE ME,
LIKE, $600,000.

19:58.968 --> 20:01.671
SHUT YOUR BIG, FAT
IDENTITY HOLE.

20:07.437 --> 20:10.440
I ACCIDENTALLY THREW OUT YOUR
FAVORITE RAIDERS JERSEY.

20:13.343 --> 20:14.984
I´LL GET ANOTHER ONE.

20:16.446 --> 20:18.748
MY MOM´S HAVING
HER HOUSE TENTED,

20:18.748 --> 20:21.521
SO SHE MIGHT HAVE TO
STAY WITH US FOR A WEEK.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.723
I´LL BUY MORE BEER.

20:25.455 --> 20:27.497
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE WENT TO THE LAKE,

20:27.497 --> 20:30.530
AND IT RAINED THE WHOLE WEEKEND,
AND WE STAYED IN THE ROOM?

20:30.530 --> 20:33.933
[ Seductively ]
YEAH?

20:33.933 --> 20:36.806
I LOST THAT VIDEO WE MADE.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.772
WHAT?!

20:44.774 --> 20:46.976
TIME FOR
A NEW MASK, BABY.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.951
AHH!
