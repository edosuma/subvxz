WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.369
I'm done with the life, Jenn.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.170
What do you say we take whatever
we got saved up and move?

00:05.172 --> 00:06.438
Don't you worry about Jenn.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.840
I'm gonna take
real good care of her.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.074
We're moving to Israel.

00:09.076 --> 00:11.176
Get him, baby!
He's getting away!

00:11.178 --> 00:12.678
We need y'all on our side.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.746
We can settle this together.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.581
Make money and get back
at the Russians.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.782
Desna Simms.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.018
You're under arrest for
money laundering and fraud.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.886
Bail is set at $500,000.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.021
I don't have that kind of money.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.055
It's taken care of.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.523
Please tell me again.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.091
I went down on my knees.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.693
And she said yes.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.962
She really thinks you love her?

00:29.964 --> 00:30.996
New plan.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.631
I marry him, you kill him,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.633
then I sign his assets
over to you.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.734
And then I'm done.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.302
I decided me and Virginia
are moving out.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.238
What's up with this photo?
You have a twin sister?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.672
We're not that close.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.673
Wire returned.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.642
You were wearing a wire?
We're done.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.111
It's gonna be okay.
At least I have you.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.003 --> 01:11.036
Shit.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.573
It's okay. Shh. Come here.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.308
Plant your feet, all right?
Okay.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.876
Shit's popping off.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.279
We need you ready, baby, okay?

01:20.281 --> 01:22.047
Watch your breathing.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.216
Keep both eyes open.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.684
Hate it and hit it, baby.
Let's go.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.985
Try again.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.094
That's what I'm talking about.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.400
D, I honestly don't know
what I would do

01:41.402 --> 01:43.569
if something
were to happen to you.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.873
What?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.818
Wait a minute. What you doing?

01:59.820 --> 02:01.120
You know what I'm doing.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.288
Hurry up.

02:03.290 --> 02:05.657
I got a fake wedding to plan.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.292
Shit.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.639
Ken.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.176
Ken, put in
your damn mouth guard.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.879
You're grinding
your teeth again.

02:26.881 --> 02:29.882
Ken!

02:33.287 --> 02:35.120
Marnie!

02:37.658 --> 02:39.858
Marnie, sugar?

02:42.429 --> 02:44.363
It's time to get up.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.266
Marnie?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.336
Marnie!

02:59.980 --> 03:01.113
"Dear Polly,"

03:01.115 --> 03:03.081
I know you have given me a lot,

03:03.083 --> 03:04.616
but I want to be with my mom.

03:04.618 --> 03:05.984
"My real mom."

03:05.986 --> 03:08.020
"To paraphrase
the great Malcolm X,"

03:08.022 --> 03:11.456
it's time for this chicken
to come home to roost.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.859
My mom's changed, Polly,
and I see it.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.794
"It's wrong for me
not to forgive her."

03:43.924 --> 03:45.257
What up? This is Marnie.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.499
Leave a message after the beep.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.477
Marnie?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.948
Hey, sis.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.416
Wow.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.151
What do you call
that shade of red...

04:13.153 --> 04:15.821
"Cry for Help"?

04:21.427 --> 04:23.262
Lillian,
what are you doing here?

04:23.264 --> 04:25.264
Just a little business,
a little pleasure.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.734
But, seriously,
I came to check up on you.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.369
You okay?
I came right from the airport.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.272
Um, now is not a... a good time.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.574
I have a family situation
to deal with.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.842
What do you think
you're looking at?

04:36.844 --> 04:38.243
Why don't you just, um,
let me know

04:38.245 --> 04:39.611
what hotel you're staying at,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.013
like, send me a text
or something, and I'll...

04:41.015 --> 04:44.416
And I'll, um...
I-I-I'll give you a call.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.351
I'm still here.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.921
Another time, Lillian.

04:51.358 --> 04:54.293
Polly.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.194
Come on, girl.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.563
Playing games with me again?
Please go, please go, please go...

04:58.565 --> 05:01.533
I came a really long way
to see you, Polly!

05:24.892 --> 05:26.124
Hey. What's wrong?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.426
I don't like this place.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.994
I-I don't like it at all.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.563
I don't like this place at all.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.298
Hey, you want some?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.033
My mom used to always
give me these

05:35.035 --> 05:36.368
whenever I felt sad.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.370
I-I don't want Cheetos.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.073
I want... I want peace
and tranquility.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.408
That's... That's all I want,
n-nothing else.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.609
Okay, okay, okay.

05:44.611 --> 05:48.380
Look, hey, do you want to
have sex?

05:48.382 --> 05:49.481
Okay. Yeah?

05:49.483 --> 05:50.582
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.085
Okay. Okay.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.354
Okay.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.388
Hey. Yeah.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.656
Yeah.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.592
Is my breath kickin'?

06:00.594 --> 06:01.727
I-I don't mind.

06:01.729 --> 06:02.961
You sure? Yeah.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.229
Okay. So sweet.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.699
Okay. Yeah.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.434
Okay.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.403
Okay.

06:12.439 --> 06:14.072
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.612
No. It's, mold.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.547
The spores are hazardous.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.683
No, no. Virginia, spores are...

06:24.685 --> 06:26.618
Just focus on me, okay?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.487
Okay.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.021
No!

06:30.023 --> 06:32.257
No, no, no!

06:42.169 --> 06:43.435
What's up, Zlata?

06:43.437 --> 06:44.936
Hello, sister-friend.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.906
Are you ready for
wedding planning-palooza today?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.041
Not really, but I will pull up.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.276
Good.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.344
Is like game...

06:52.346 --> 06:53.779
Screw, marry, kill.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.380
You mean screw, marry,

06:55.382 --> 06:59.050
sign over his assets,
and then kill.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.252
Holla that.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.154
On to more happy thoughts.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.655
Ways to kill asshole...

07:03.657 --> 07:07.559
Gun, Glock, Beretta.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.593
I don't know.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.728
Drowning.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.930
I drown cat once.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.265
Very effective.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.533
Bad pussy!

07:14.535 --> 07:16.468
Okay, dial back the psycho.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.570
Fine. Poison.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.339
Not very interesting,
but KGB recommend.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.809
Fine, Zlata, you poison him,

07:23.811 --> 07:26.344
I'll sign over the assets,
open your clinics,

07:26.346 --> 07:27.646
and then I'm done.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.881
Or I have proposition for you.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.951
What if we become partners?

07:32.953 --> 07:36.521
We run clinics together
all over state.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.391
Yeah, I like our plan
like it is.

07:39.393 --> 07:40.792
Think on it.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.394
We would be like...

07:42.396 --> 07:43.795
Putin and Trump.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.898
Zlata, I got to go.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.033
Bye-bye.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.869
Sunshine, beaches,
and tramp stamps.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.038
You're walking so good, baby.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.973
Isn't Daddy walking good?

07:54.975 --> 07:56.508
I knew you'd get out so soon.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.943
You're home free.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.678
Yeah. How'd you like to be
home free in Tampa?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.379
What's in Tampa?

08:01.381 --> 08:02.647
Fresh start.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.182
Look at this.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.118
Found the perfect house on Zoetrope.
Babe...

08:07.120 --> 08:09.621
A great school district,
A.A. meeting down the street,

08:09.623 --> 08:11.923
no psychotic rabbis.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.961
I say we move right after
Desna's fake wedding.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.865
You know,
I also did a little research,

08:19.867 --> 08:23.835
and the nail salon
around the corner's hiring.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.837
Baby, can we even afford
a house like that?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.974
I already set up a meeting
with a loan officer at a bank.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.976
Holy shit.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.418
You don't mess with me,
Bryce Husser.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.381
Brienne, I said get down 'fore
you fall and break your neck.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.716
Did I stutter?

08:37.717 --> 08:40.018
You'd really peace out
on Uncle Daddy and Roller?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.486
Hell yeah.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.808
Then they'd finally have to
learn how to use e-mail, but...

08:45.692 --> 08:47.125
Baby girl,

08:47.127 --> 08:48.727
guess what's in Tampa.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.161
Busch Gardens. Yeah.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.063
Yeah. And guess who's going
every weekend.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.098
- We are!
- We are!

08:53.100 --> 08:54.099
Yeah! Whoo!

08:54.101 --> 08:55.667
Probably not. Probably not.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.002
Probably just
me and your dad's gonna go,

08:57.004 --> 08:58.837
but we'll... we'll
take you somewhere.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.010
Okay, Marnie's been missing
six hours now.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.244
I think I should call the police

09:06.246 --> 09:07.846
and get her on a milk carton
or something.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.347
Polly. Yeah. I should.

09:09.349 --> 09:12.751
Pol, I want you to
take a deep, white breath, okay?

09:12.753 --> 09:14.286
Okay, she's not missing.

09:14.288 --> 09:15.587
Baby, she's with her mama.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.222
I was her mama. I know.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.924
She was happy with me.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.493
I painted her room.
I put up pink curtains.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.028
I sewed little matching pillows.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.629
I even learned how to make.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.465
Nation of Islam bean pies for her.
Bean pies. I know.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.567
They were delicious.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.601
Polly, it's gonna be okay.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.635
Hey, Deanie.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.571
Hi, Jennifer.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.139
Hey, Dean.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.074
Hey, boo.
Thought you had to work today.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.642
Yeah, yeah, I do in an hour,

09:37.644 --> 09:39.644
but I-I just didn't want to
wait at the motel.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.580
Well, um, you know,

09:41.582 --> 09:44.049
you guys could always
come back home.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.818
Unfortunately, because of
your horrible life choices,

09:46.820 --> 09:48.687
that's no longer
an option for us.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.854
Okay.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.157
Um...

09:52.159 --> 09:53.992
We are going to look at dresses,

09:53.994 --> 09:57.228
and it's right next door to
that ice-cream place you like.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.263
Why don't you come with?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.700
I-I-Ice cream makes me look
bloated in my G-string.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.669
P-Polly, why are you crying?

10:04.671 --> 10:06.638
Nothing. It's fine. I'm fine.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.573
A-Are you upset
because my cherry pop

10:08.575 --> 10:09.808
was a little off last night?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.242
No, but, I mean, how many times

10:11.244 --> 10:13.111
do I have to
show you that, Dean?!

10:14.314 --> 10:16.948
Dean, listen, it's not about
the cherry pop.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.851
Polly is going through
something, okay?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.953
I-I-It wasn't that off.
I'll show you. It was...

10:21.955 --> 10:24.489
No, no, no. No, no.
I don't need to see it.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.257
It was just... Okay.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.061
Hey, Marnie, it's me again.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.863
Can you call me back, sugar?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.732
I really need to talk to you.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.406
Hey, girl, hey.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.676
What the hell, Lillian?
You came to my job?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.811
Yeah, I did. I figured it out.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.514
You're still holding a grudge
over that boy.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.017
Frankly, it's very CW.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.653
Zero to 60, as per usual.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.888
It was never about him.
Yeah, it was.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.624
You always want to
make it about something else.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.059
Why are you doing this?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.160
You know why.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.763
I've told you...
It's not a good time.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.197
And I'm not
gonna tell you again!

11:06.199 --> 11:07.565
Whoa!

11:07.567 --> 11:09.467
Polly Jane!

11:09.469 --> 11:11.603
Still pushing people.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.873
Well, I see
not much has changed.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.509
Go back to where you came from,
Lillian!

11:21.548 --> 11:23.014
Y'all ready?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.683
So, Zlata was okay
with you leaving her hanging?

11:24.685 --> 11:25.984
She said so.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.552
I mean, she told me
to think about it,

11:27.554 --> 11:29.788
but y'all know how it is.
She gonna keep pushing.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.223
Move away from the vortex,
Desna.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.025
That bitch
will just suck you in.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.326
Okay.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.863
- Hey, you all right, girl?
- What? Yeah. No.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.032
Um, do y'all mind
if I just stay behind?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.801
- I'll hold down the fort.
- Pol.

11:42.803 --> 11:43.935
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

11:43.937 --> 11:45.270
Yeah. I'm fine.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.005
I'll just wait here
until Marnie calls.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.574
All right, bitches, claws up.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.509
We got a wedding to fake.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.244
I got shotgun.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.760
Whoop! You missed a spot.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.829
Lillian, what is it gonna take

12:10.831 --> 12:12.130
to get you to leave?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.632
All you got to do is talk to me.

12:13.634 --> 12:15.534
Just talk to me
for five minutes.

12:15.536 --> 12:17.302
No.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.370
Okay, fine.

12:18.372 --> 12:20.806
Then I'll just
park my tush right here

12:20.808 --> 12:22.140
until you're ready to chat.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.676
No rush.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.045
What do you want, Ken?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.146
I miss you. I want you back.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.414
Well, that's not gonna happen.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.816
You know what you did.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.218
That sounds familiar.
Look, I have a client.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.387
No, but we...
We love each other.

12:35.389 --> 12:36.421
We're done, Ken.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.756
P-Polly...

12:37.758 --> 12:39.024
But we're not done, are we?

12:39.026 --> 12:40.359
My God.

12:40.361 --> 12:42.628
Look, they have a color
called "Evil Twin."

12:42.630 --> 12:45.030
Come on. That's funny.

12:48.302 --> 12:50.335
All right, child.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.670
Let's get this shit over with.

12:51.672 --> 12:53.171
Hi. Can I help you?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.807
Yep. I'm in a wedding
that I don't want to be in.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.142
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.278
Nope. I'm the bride.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.346
Well, all of our knock-offs

13:01.348 --> 13:02.814
are here in the corner.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.017
There's something in the budget
for everybody.

13:05.019 --> 13:06.785
We have our one-percenter room
in the back,

13:06.787 --> 13:09.588
but nothing under $5,000.

13:09.590 --> 13:11.123
$5,000?

13:11.125 --> 13:13.525
That dress better slap your ass
and play with your nips.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.927
Okay.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.696
He gave you his black Amex.

13:17.698 --> 13:19.865
Okay, girl,
you know what they say...

13:19.867 --> 13:22.401
Once you go black,
you got to buy everything.

13:22.403 --> 13:24.269
- God.
- Shut up.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.738
You're so dumb.
Why are you so dumb?

13:26.740 --> 13:29.107
So, Des, um,

13:29.109 --> 13:31.009
you know that once we're done
with all this Ruval shit,

13:31.011 --> 13:32.311
it's gonna be back to Walmart,

13:32.313 --> 13:35.113
so why don't we
have fun while we can?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.748
Why don't we do it?

13:36.750 --> 13:39.151
Come on.

13:39.153 --> 13:40.485
Come on.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.087
Excuse me.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.021
Yes!

13:43.023 --> 13:44.423
We want what's in the back.

13:44.425 --> 13:45.857
Ahem.

13:45.859 --> 13:48.193
- And some champagne.
- Okurrr.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.928
Desna.

13:52.366 --> 13:53.765
Ladies.

13:53.767 --> 13:57.269
I would like to see you
in the dress that I sent you.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.939
- Good job, gentlemen!
- Yeah!

14:00.941 --> 14:04.109
Cocaine sales have
made us liquid once again!

14:04.111 --> 14:05.544
Whoo!

14:05.546 --> 14:06.645
Cheers!

14:07.881 --> 14:09.915
All right, now,
we got to be smart

14:09.917 --> 14:12.217
about our finances, okay?

14:12.219 --> 14:15.020
Once we take out
the Russians and the Haitians,

14:15.022 --> 14:16.988
the pill business
is gonna be ours again.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.124
But we need to think bigger.
Expansion.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.393
That's exactly what
I'm talking about there, boy!

14:21.395 --> 14:22.794
You're a smart one, ain't you?

14:24.231 --> 14:26.531
You know what I was thinking?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.934
We get a taco truck, right?

14:28.936 --> 14:31.103
But we ain't selling no tacos.

14:31.105 --> 14:34.106
We selling
enchiladas con OxyContin, baby,

14:34.108 --> 14:36.108
right out the back, on the low.

14:36.110 --> 14:39.311
Boy, I ain't gonna mortgage
the future of this organization

14:39.313 --> 14:40.946
on some goddamn amigo truck.

14:40.948 --> 14:41.980
What the hell?

14:41.982 --> 14:43.281
What about clinics?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.649
We already got those,
Warren Buffett.

14:44.651 --> 14:48.387
All right, hear me out.
Rehab clinics, okay?

14:48.389 --> 14:49.988
We make money on both ends...

14:49.990 --> 14:51.456
Feed their addiction,

14:51.458 --> 14:53.024
and then we charge them
to recover.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.292
- Circle of life.
- Right.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.861
- I like it.
- Keeps on going.

14:55.863 --> 14:57.996
- "Hakuna makada," baby.
- "Hakuna makada."

14:57.998 --> 14:59.231
So, what we need then
is a... is a...

14:59.233 --> 15:00.465
Is a location. Right.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.067
So, what you thinking about
there, Clint?

15:02.069 --> 15:04.002
Well, see... Well, shit.
I know a place.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.670
Come on.
Let's go for a little ride.

15:43.677 --> 15:45.811
Enough!

15:45.813 --> 15:47.012
Enough!

15:47.014 --> 15:49.981
This is all inappropriate.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.884
Inappropriate.

15:52.886 --> 15:55.220
These dresses.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.857
And that... that
is not a wedding gown.

15:58.859 --> 16:01.526
That is for the drag crown,

16:01.528 --> 16:04.296
for the... the RuPaul.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.564
Boo-boo, that's a compliment.

16:05.566 --> 16:08.066
Okay, I think she looks bangin'.

16:08.068 --> 16:12.170
I thought it was a bold choice
for a bold woman

16:12.172 --> 16:14.573
and that you would
appreciate that.

16:14.575 --> 16:17.008
I appreciate tradition.

16:17.010 --> 16:21.646
Try on that gown.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.082
Wha... Now!

16:30.924 --> 16:33.058
You're so talented, Polly.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.060
When did you get
so good at this?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.562
You know I've been painting
since college.

16:37.564 --> 16:41.533
Yeah, those little
baby sailboat pictures.

16:41.535 --> 16:43.735
Nautical miniatures.

16:43.737 --> 16:44.970
Do you want a top coat?

16:44.972 --> 16:47.539
You're the expert.

16:47.541 --> 16:50.642
So, um, was that
your boyfriend who called?

16:50.644 --> 16:53.111
Ex. Ex? Who dumped whom?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.280
It's a long story.
It's the first relationship

16:55.282 --> 16:58.416
that I've been in since my...

16:58.418 --> 16:59.451
time away.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.553
You mean jail?

17:01.555 --> 17:04.055
Well, we all knew
you weren't in Monaco.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.858
Wasn't that hard
to figure out, girl.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.060
Well, you never reached out.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.229
Yeah, well, we know how you get.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.332
So we just tolerated the ruse.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.734
That's very generous of you.

17:16.737 --> 17:17.969
It's just... It's a time

17:17.971 --> 17:19.671
that I don't like
to think about.

17:19.673 --> 17:22.240
Yeah. There's a lot
you don't think about.

17:28.048 --> 17:31.750
So, did you join a gang
and get a prison wife?

17:31.752 --> 17:34.019
No... and yes.

17:34.021 --> 17:35.921
What? Shut it.

17:35.923 --> 17:37.789
Mnh-mnh. Details!

17:39.159 --> 17:40.992
See? This is fun, right?

17:40.994 --> 17:42.561
This is like old times.

17:42.563 --> 17:46.264
So, um, when was the last time
you talked to Mom and Dad?

17:46.266 --> 17:50.001
Lillian... do not go there.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.337
Okay, okay. Retract.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.772
We'll just, -
We'll just keep getting

17:53.774 --> 17:56.341
their bullshit dog-portrait
Christmas cards every year

17:56.343 --> 17:58.076
and keep pretending
that we love each other.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.411
Don't worry.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.680
You know what?
Um, let's catch up later.

18:01.682 --> 18:02.914
How long are you in town?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.649
Wait. Wait, wait. Why so soon?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.385
- Let me show you out.
- I just got here.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.187
Don't you want to know
what I've been up to?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.589
Not that I have any free time.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.757
I literally work every minute.
Lillian...

18:12.759 --> 18:14.759
Sometimes I feel like
I don't even sleep.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.896
Lillian!

18:17.898 --> 18:18.997
Are you open?

18:18.999 --> 18:20.231
I can't do this right now!

18:20.233 --> 18:21.533
I have a client!

18:21.535 --> 18:24.202
Fine. The Koreans
are cheaper, anyway.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.537
Um, I-I'm...

18:25.539 --> 18:28.974
Polly, I'm here
because of what you did.

18:28.976 --> 18:30.208
You need to face it.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.477
No. No.
I don't want to face anything.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.913
I want you to leave me alone.

18:42.823 --> 18:44.856
Why did I agree to this?

18:44.858 --> 18:46.124
This shit ain't me.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.026
My God, girl, you look so good.

18:48.028 --> 18:50.495
And you only got a little bit
of titty out.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.530
Des, baby, please turn around.
Please turn around and look.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.599
- Just look. Just look.
- Girl, turn around.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.007
Increíble, Des.

19:02.009 --> 19:04.175
- Mnh-mnh.
- Don't...

19:04.177 --> 19:05.510
Don't do it.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.911
Des, you just look so beautiful.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.913
Listen, just 'cause
it's not happening right now

19:08.915 --> 19:11.049
doesn't mean it's not gonna
happen, okay? Mnh-mnh.

19:11.051 --> 19:12.083
You gonna make me start.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.518
- Stop it!
- Don't cry, Des.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.353
There's still
plenty of men out there, girl.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.823
I'm not thinking about
no damn men, Virginia.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.459
Men ain't gonna save...
Save us, y'all.

19:21.461 --> 19:25.063
I could have told you that.

19:25.065 --> 19:27.899
We need to save our damn selves.

19:29.770 --> 19:31.069
Starting now.

19:31.071 --> 19:32.537
Okay. Come on.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.039
Let's get this shit over with.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.374
All right, I'm gonna help you.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.809
Madame!

19:41.114 --> 19:43.448
What do you think?

19:43.684 --> 19:45.483
Perfect.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.185
Yay.

19:57.031 --> 19:58.297
This one is good, too.

19:58.299 --> 20:00.433
I-I can't decide.

20:00.435 --> 20:02.401
Then don't. Have them all.

20:02.403 --> 20:03.669
You playing.

20:03.671 --> 20:06.205
No. Listen, we could have
a table just full of dessert.

20:06.207 --> 20:07.807
It's too much.

20:07.809 --> 20:09.609
Gregory, it's all too much.

20:09.611 --> 20:11.544
And look how beautiful
this hotel is.

20:11.546 --> 20:15.248
I can't believe
it wasn't already booked.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.984
I own this place.

20:17.986 --> 20:19.418
What?

20:20.755 --> 20:23.523
You are full of surprises,
aren't you?

20:23.525 --> 20:27.727
You have no idea
what I have in store for you.

20:27.729 --> 20:30.429
I bet.

20:30.431 --> 20:33.399
I have to go to the hospital.

20:42.777 --> 20:45.511
No.

20:45.513 --> 20:47.513
She's wrong.

20:47.515 --> 20:49.982
She's wrong.
She's got to be wrong.

20:49.984 --> 20:51.517
I didn't do anything.

20:51.519 --> 20:53.619
Wasn't my fault.
I didn't do anything.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.391
She's got to be wrong.

21:01.162 --> 21:02.962
Here you go, my friend.

21:02.964 --> 21:05.064
Finally. I'm hungry.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.172
Yes, girlfriend.

21:13.174 --> 21:15.241
Hey, Zlata, quick question...

21:15.243 --> 21:18.311
Are Gregory's assets
only commercial spaces

21:18.313 --> 21:19.979
for pain clinics?

21:19.981 --> 21:21.414
No. He own...

21:22.283 --> 21:23.583
racetrack...

21:25.286 --> 21:27.286
convention center,

21:27.288 --> 21:29.322
and Lunar Bay Bistro.

21:29.324 --> 21:30.790
Is that all he owns?

21:30.792 --> 21:33.659
Yes, girlfriend,
just those three.

21:33.661 --> 21:36.562
So, ready to make
the partnership official?

21:36.564 --> 21:38.364
We make a pretty good team.

21:38.366 --> 21:40.733
I am not. I was just curious.

21:40.735 --> 21:42.935
Curiosity first step
to commitment.

21:42.937 --> 21:44.737
Next step is anal.

21:44.739 --> 21:45.605
But we skip that.

21:45.607 --> 21:47.373
Excuse me? Forget it.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.742
My offer stands till tonight.

21:49.744 --> 21:51.978
Make up your mind.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.413
Goodbye. Love you.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.117
Perfect, right?

21:58.119 --> 21:59.352
Lease is cheap.

21:59.354 --> 22:00.853
15,000 square feet.

22:00.855 --> 22:02.421
I mean, shit,

22:02.423 --> 22:05.224
we could rehab the shit
out of these people here?

22:08.262 --> 22:10.663
What?

22:10.665 --> 22:12.231
Y'all hear that?

22:12.233 --> 22:13.566
Yeah.

22:13.568 --> 22:16.268
Sounds like
me wiping my ass with money.

22:18.573 --> 22:20.973
Man, it's young kids, dipshit.

22:20.975 --> 22:23.843
You can't open a rehab facility
next to a place full of kids.

22:23.845 --> 22:26.012
I always thought you just
can't sell the drugs

22:26.014 --> 22:28.147
to the kids
from across the street

22:28.149 --> 22:29.582
from where the school is
or whatever.

22:29.584 --> 22:31.317
School's a block away, man.

22:31.319 --> 22:33.019
No can do.

22:33.721 --> 22:36.188
Now we all got to think
of something else.

22:37.725 --> 22:39.058
I got an idea.

22:39.060 --> 22:41.961
Why don't we just put it
right next to the Suncoast?

22:41.963 --> 22:46.065
That way, we got
the pillheads coming and going.

22:46.067 --> 22:48.067
Called "vertical integration."

22:48.069 --> 22:50.703
You smart, man.
That's a great idea, Clint.

22:50.705 --> 22:52.705
Vertically integrate my dick.

22:58.379 --> 23:00.179
Boy, I haven't seen you
this excited

23:00.181 --> 23:02.081
since you fit into
your skinny-skinny jeans

23:02.083 --> 23:03.115
after having Baylor.

23:03.117 --> 23:04.316
Lord.

23:04.318 --> 23:05.484
Wasn't that
a short-lived victory?

23:05.486 --> 23:06.886
Hey...

23:06.888 --> 23:09.055
Yeah? ...Why don't we
have us another baby?

23:09.057 --> 23:11.090
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

23:12.326 --> 23:13.559
One thing at a time, all right?

23:13.561 --> 23:15.094
Okay. All right.
Let's be professional.

23:15.096 --> 23:16.429
Here we go. Okay. All right.

23:16.431 --> 23:18.197
Get it. Get it.

23:19.701 --> 23:21.534
What do
you think's taking so long?

23:21.536 --> 23:23.335
Don't worry.
Hey, don't... don't worry.

23:23.337 --> 23:24.770
Look, the longer it takes,
the better.

23:24.772 --> 23:26.605
Look, hey, trust me.
That house is ours.

23:26.607 --> 23:28.140
Hey... Don't... Here she comes.

23:28.142 --> 23:29.542
- Here she comes.
- Okay.

23:29.544 --> 23:31.177
Hey, yo, Karen! Karen!

23:31.179 --> 23:33.145
Karen in the house.

23:33.147 --> 23:35.514
So, is Fannie Mae a "yea"?

23:35.516 --> 23:37.950
Well, in a
Bradenton Regional Bank first,

23:37.952 --> 23:40.820
we are going to have to deny
a cute, white, young couple

23:40.822 --> 23:42.121
a home loan.

23:42.123 --> 23:45.291
Between your criminal record
and your $12-an-hour job,

23:45.293 --> 23:47.693
it's not gonna happen. Lollipop?

23:52.667 --> 23:53.999
Desna.

23:54.001 --> 23:56.235
Girl, you look
just like your picture.

23:56.237 --> 23:59.705
Dr. Ruval... he'll be back
from the hospital in about 15.

23:59.707 --> 24:01.974
Well, I was hoping I could hide

24:01.976 --> 24:05.911
this little pre-wedding-day
present in his office.

24:05.913 --> 24:07.346
Wow.

24:07.348 --> 24:09.148
Look at this ring.

24:09.150 --> 24:12.218
Nice, right? Girl, I'm just
glad a sister caught him.

24:12.220 --> 24:13.719
That part.

24:15.156 --> 24:16.689
Right in here.

24:16.691 --> 24:18.624
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:34.509 --> 24:36.842
Shit.

25:02.336 --> 25:05.070
Damn. He owns all this shit?

25:15.116 --> 25:18.083
Bingo.

25:27.051 --> 25:29.384
You... You... You don't
understand, Karen, okay?

25:29.386 --> 25:30.652
I just recovered from being shot

25:30.654 --> 25:32.387
by the damn Russian Mafia, okay?

25:32.389 --> 25:33.789
I'm lucky to even be alive.

25:33.791 --> 25:35.457
And then he had to
break out of the hospital

25:35.459 --> 25:37.125
and rescue me
from a crazy-ass stalker

25:37.127 --> 25:38.393
and save our family,

25:38.395 --> 25:39.828
which includes
a little mixed-race girl,

25:39.830 --> 25:41.697
which isn't even his,
but he adopted her like a boss.

25:41.699 --> 25:43.665
Yeah, the three of us
became a family.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.101
And before you knew it,
we had a daughter of our own.

25:46.103 --> 25:48.170
He is the best damn daddy
you have ever seen.

25:48.172 --> 25:51.039
She is the fiercest mommy
you have ever seen.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.910
Baby, you're the best husband that
any woman could ever ask for.

25:54.912 --> 25:56.211
I mean it.

25:56.213 --> 25:59.548
And you are the best goddamn
wife a man could ever have.

25:59.550 --> 26:02.050
I love you.

26:02.052 --> 26:03.552
I love you.

26:03.554 --> 26:08.390
Karen, we have been to
hell and back, so... so, no.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.791
No, thank you.

26:09.793 --> 26:12.194
We deserve a lot more
than a damn lollipop.

26:14.598 --> 26:16.098
You're right.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.234
You do deserve more
than a damn lollipop.

26:19.236 --> 26:22.571
I feel terrible
for what you've been through.

26:22.573 --> 26:24.506
Yeah, we're just
a couple of folks

26:24.508 --> 26:26.007
trying to do their best. Yeah.

26:26.009 --> 26:27.109
I hear you.

26:27.111 --> 26:29.978
I have student loans
out the ying-yang.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.881
So what if I did a little
shoplifting when I was 16?

26:32.883 --> 26:34.483
Should that stop me from getting

26:34.485 --> 26:36.551
a one-bedroom apartment
on Lido Beach?

26:36.553 --> 26:38.553
Absolutely not.
See, you get it, Karen.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.988
That is exactly
what we're saying.

26:39.990 --> 26:42.324
I do.

26:42.326 --> 26:44.559
This job can be so heartless.

26:46.830 --> 26:50.265
On behalf of
Bradenton Regional Bank,

26:50.267 --> 26:53.602
your home loan application...

26:53.604 --> 26:56.204
is once again denied.

26:56.206 --> 26:57.405
Would you like a pen?

27:04.715 --> 27:06.748
You have lopsided tits, Karen.

27:14.558 --> 27:16.691
Get your...
Don't you dare touch me.

27:19.229 --> 27:20.462
Sweetie?

27:24.468 --> 27:28.370
How you doing, man?

27:28.372 --> 27:30.338
Whoa, whoa. Hang on. Hang on.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.407
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

27:32.409 --> 27:34.409
I was... I'm better now.

27:34.411 --> 27:35.811
I'm better. Look. See?

27:35.813 --> 27:37.779
I was never gonna
bring her to Israel...

27:37.781 --> 27:39.447
and make her be my wife.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.949
Shut your mouth.

27:40.951 --> 27:44.553
Hang on there, Roller.
No sense in being impolite.

27:44.555 --> 27:46.755
No. We got
a proposition for you.

27:46.757 --> 27:48.857
- Anything y'all want.
- Fantastic.

27:48.859 --> 27:51.393
We'd like to buy the place.

27:58.035 --> 27:59.668
Y-You're serious.

27:59.670 --> 28:02.037
Yeah, it's a little idea
my second cousin Clint here had.

28:02.039 --> 28:05.707
Yeah. He said some shit
about "vaginal interrogations."

28:05.709 --> 28:08.443
Vertical integration.

28:08.445 --> 28:10.145
We're buyin', you're sellin',

28:10.147 --> 28:12.013
and we ain't paying
a buck over $25.

28:12.015 --> 28:13.715
What we got right here for you

28:13.717 --> 28:16.918
is a simple, very standard
transfer of deed.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.920
Look, I appreciate
the offer, gentlemen,

28:18.922 --> 28:20.922
but... but this
is a place of worship...

28:20.924 --> 28:22.924
- No, no, no.
- And down-home recreation.

28:22.926 --> 28:24.259
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I ain't interested

28:24.261 --> 28:25.760
in getting into
the real-estate business.

28:25.762 --> 28:28.697
Shh. Best use that thinking cap.

28:28.699 --> 28:32.334
Let's call Bryce,
see if he can convince you.

28:33.704 --> 28:35.737
Marnie, I have left you
six voicemails.

28:35.739 --> 28:37.873
You need to
at least call me back.

28:37.875 --> 28:40.842
Or just send a text, please.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.577
I'm also on Snapchat.
I love you.

28:42.579 --> 28:43.945
Me again.

28:43.947 --> 28:45.413
Geez, you scared
the shit out of me.

28:45.415 --> 28:47.816
You know what your problem is?
Yeah... you.

28:47.818 --> 28:51.219
You keep trying to
re-create our relationship...

28:51.221 --> 28:53.588
With Ken,
with the rent-a-daughter.

28:53.590 --> 28:56.124
You cannot just do this.
Face the music!

28:56.126 --> 28:59.594
You can't just barge into my
life... Our music, Polly Jane.

28:59.596 --> 29:01.062
Remember "True Colors"?

29:04.167 --> 29:05.767
No. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

29:05.769 --> 29:07.469
You're never gonna have
a real relationship

29:07.471 --> 29:10.171
until you deal with me
and face what happened.

29:10.173 --> 29:14.276
I don't have to listen to this.

29:14.278 --> 29:15.777
I don't.

29:18.949 --> 29:20.582
No. No way. I... There's no way

29:20.584 --> 29:22.050
I'm signing this deed
over to you.

29:22.052 --> 29:25.153
I'm not gonna ask you again.

29:25.155 --> 29:27.555
Put your signature
on this document.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.623
No.

29:28.625 --> 29:29.791
Come here.

29:29.793 --> 29:31.126
This is how we do it
around here...

29:31.128 --> 29:33.461
No fancy words...
Just cold, hard metal.

29:33.463 --> 29:34.996
Works every time.

29:34.998 --> 29:36.932
Uncle Daddy, what in the hell
are y'all doing here?

29:36.934 --> 29:39.134
What's it look like?
Bryce, please.

29:39.136 --> 29:40.735
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, okay?

29:40.737 --> 29:42.404
Hey, hey, guys, guys,
guys, guys, come on.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.840
Let's... Let's take this down a notch?
Sign it.

29:45.842 --> 29:48.777
Sign it, or you're gonna sign it
in your cold blood.

29:50.013 --> 29:51.746
- There we go.
- All right.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.848
That wasn't so hard.

29:53.850 --> 29:55.483
Move that wrist.

29:55.485 --> 29:56.985
Hey.

29:56.987 --> 29:59.587
Yeah, that's a good boy.
There we go.

29:59.589 --> 30:00.922
That's all it was.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.557
We are the proud owner
of a new building.

30:02.559 --> 30:04.292
Yes, we are.
Thank you for your business.

30:04.294 --> 30:05.894
Can I go? I signed it.

30:05.896 --> 30:08.029
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

30:08.031 --> 30:09.965
Not after all that shit
you did to my brother.

30:09.967 --> 30:11.866
Roller. Roller, calm... Hey.

30:11.868 --> 30:13.368
- Bryce...
- Calm down.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.236
You gonna let this fool
get away with all that shit?

30:15.238 --> 30:16.771
- Hey, just put the gun away.
- He signed it.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.139
He signed the papers.

30:18.141 --> 30:19.741
- Put the gun down, all right?
- No.

30:19.743 --> 30:22.444
Put the gun down!

30:22.446 --> 30:23.545
God damn it.

30:23.547 --> 30:24.713
Bang.

30:24.715 --> 30:27.782
- Crazy ass.
- Thank you, Bryce.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.317
I never thought
you'd be so kind to me

30:29.319 --> 30:32.320
after I ate
your wife's sweet pussy.

30:41.631 --> 30:45.400
I don't know. I think you...

30:45.402 --> 30:48.536
Looks like you didn't
put your initials there.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.074
Damn, Bryce!

30:53.076 --> 30:56.444
Make him rain, right?
Make him rain.

30:56.446 --> 30:58.580
- Shit.
- Jesus, man.

30:58.582 --> 30:59.748
- Damn it.
- Good?

30:59.750 --> 31:01.483
- Whoo!
- Yeah, yeah. It's good.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.518
Signature's
all right. We're good.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.620
Come on, man.
A little warning next time.

31:05.622 --> 31:07.989
Geez. Anybody got a Wet-Nap?

31:11.762 --> 31:14.295
What's going on, D?

31:16.266 --> 31:18.600
Why you got that wild look
in your eye?

31:20.070 --> 31:21.336
What's going on with you?

31:21.338 --> 31:22.670
I asked you first.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.572
Cousin getting on my nerve.

31:24.574 --> 31:25.874
Barely been here a week,

31:25.876 --> 31:27.308
already got Uncle Daddy
in his pocket.

31:27.310 --> 31:29.344
I ain't never seen
jealous Roller before.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.080
Not jealous Roller.
He's just irritating me.

31:32.082 --> 31:35.016
Why you got
that wild look in your eye?

31:35.018 --> 31:36.718
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.887
Game recognize game, baby.

31:38.889 --> 31:40.655
Mind your business.

31:40.657 --> 31:42.090
I'm minding my business.

31:43.326 --> 31:45.960
What happened this morning
don't make me your business.

31:45.962 --> 31:49.197
Baby, I'm just here
to take back what's mine.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.799
Ditto.

31:50.801 --> 31:52.067
Stop running.

31:52.069 --> 31:54.469
Come on. You need to face this.

31:54.471 --> 31:55.670
This is too long.

31:55.672 --> 31:56.938
You've been here too long. Hey.

31:56.940 --> 31:59.174
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey!

31:59.176 --> 32:00.842
Girl.

32:12.589 --> 32:15.390
Ken, what are you doing?

32:15.392 --> 32:16.691
I'm apologizing.

32:16.693 --> 32:18.827
Well, now is
an extremely bad time, okay?

32:18.829 --> 32:20.528
- You're not kidding.
- Shut up.

32:20.530 --> 32:22.964
What are you talking about?
If you just hear me out,

32:22.966 --> 32:25.233
you'd see I had no choice
about the wire.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.635
It doesn't matter.
You betrayed me.

32:27.637 --> 32:28.903
You betrayed all of us.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.105
You're the betrayer.

32:30.107 --> 32:32.474
I hate you.
Don't you even get that?

32:32.476 --> 32:35.543
Polly, you can't go
from loving to hating.

32:35.545 --> 32:36.678
I don't care what you say.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.980
You see? You push everyone away.

32:38.982 --> 32:40.315
All right, I've had enough!

32:40.317 --> 32:42.684
You always wanted everything
that I had!

32:42.686 --> 32:45.053
What... What... What are you
talking about? Everything!

32:45.055 --> 32:47.222
You took everything from me!

32:47.224 --> 32:48.890
All you had to say
was you need some space.

32:48.892 --> 32:50.391
Hey!

32:50.393 --> 32:51.659
You're delusional.

32:51.661 --> 32:52.727
Go to hell!

32:52.729 --> 32:54.062
- Hey.
- Polly.

32:54.064 --> 32:56.397
- What's going on?
- I hate you, Lillian!

32:56.399 --> 32:59.367
I hate you! You mean
your sister Lillian?

32:59.369 --> 33:02.103
Get her away from me!
I hate her! I hate her!

33:02.105 --> 33:03.838
- Dr.
- What's going on?

33:06.676 --> 33:08.209
God.

33:08.211 --> 33:10.178
I-I need help. I need help.
I need help. I need help.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.346
Okay. Okay. I need help.

33:11.348 --> 33:12.914
You want me to take you home?

33:12.916 --> 33:15.483
No. I need you to
take me to the hospital.

33:17.087 --> 33:18.953
It's happening again. Okay.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.556
Come on.

33:21.558 --> 33:23.424
It's gonna be okay.

33:23.426 --> 33:24.626
Okay, Pol. Okay.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.194
Okay.

33:28.131 --> 33:31.199
No.

33:36.585 --> 33:39.186
What is taking so long?

33:39.188 --> 33:40.988
I thought
she was just different,

33:40.990 --> 33:43.190
not different different.

33:43.192 --> 33:45.292
We all got a little something.

33:47.897 --> 33:50.397
I can't believe
I didn't see this coming.

33:50.399 --> 33:51.799
This is all my fault.

33:51.801 --> 33:53.500
I think our breakup
triggered this.

33:53.502 --> 33:55.969
It's not your fault, Ken.

33:55.971 --> 33:57.371
I was wearing the wire.

33:59.842 --> 34:01.608
When she found out,
she dumped me.

34:01.610 --> 34:02.810
Told y'all it wasn't me.

34:02.812 --> 34:04.845
It was you? You ratted us out?!

34:04.847 --> 34:06.580
I had no choice. They weren't
trying to get you.

34:06.582 --> 34:07.915
They were trying
to get the Russians.

34:07.917 --> 34:09.949
Then why didn't you
say something, Kenneth?!

34:09.952 --> 34:13.954
Please don't fire me.
You stupid piece of shit!

34:13.956 --> 34:16.889
We didn't deserve that.
Polly didn't deserve that!

34:18.561 --> 34:20.427
Hey. How's she doing?

34:20.429 --> 34:22.362
Well, not great.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.331
Your friend is suffering from
a psychotic break. Shit.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.301
And we'd like to
hold her here for examination

34:27.303 --> 34:28.469
for the next 72 hours.

34:28.471 --> 34:30.270
But after that,
she's gonna be all right?

34:30.272 --> 34:32.873
It's gonna take time.
We need to run more tests.

34:32.875 --> 34:36.744
But I'll be honest...
This is a pretty extreme case.

34:36.746 --> 34:38.478
Does your friend
have family nearby?

34:38.481 --> 34:39.646
We're her family.

34:39.648 --> 34:41.748
Yeah. Can we see her? Please.

34:41.751 --> 34:43.851
- Come on.
- Come on, y'all.

34:44.820 --> 34:47.387
Unh-unh. Not you, snitch.

34:51.527 --> 34:54.628
My boy, back in the fold.

34:54.630 --> 34:56.630
That feel good?

34:56.632 --> 34:58.165
Yeah, I got to admit, it did.

34:58.167 --> 34:59.566
There's a lesson there, boys...

34:59.568 --> 35:02.069
Never let a married woman
lick your asshole.

35:02.071 --> 35:03.337
What is that about?

35:03.339 --> 35:05.539
Family thing, "Georgia."

35:05.541 --> 35:07.441
You wouldn't understand.

35:07.443 --> 35:09.376
Where you going, Bryce?
Have another chicken wing.

35:09.378 --> 35:12.780
Yeah, um, you know,
me and the kids and Jenn...

35:12.782 --> 35:14.681
We're... we're still
going to Tampa.

35:14.683 --> 35:16.483
Come on, now, Bryce. Come on.

35:16.485 --> 35:18.051
I mean, I don't know
where we're gonna live,

35:18.053 --> 35:19.453
but we'll figure something out.

35:19.455 --> 35:20.921
What happened at the bank?

35:20.923 --> 35:23.557
Well, it turns out
that the bank don't give loans

35:23.559 --> 35:25.626
to former crackheads.

35:25.628 --> 35:27.127
Damn banks.

35:27.129 --> 35:28.695
Come here, boy.
Let's talk about your future.

35:28.697 --> 35:30.931
Uncle Daddy, I already
talked to you about this...

35:30.933 --> 35:32.599
Come on, now. Come here.

35:32.601 --> 35:35.669
Now, I don't know what
them banks are thinking,

35:35.671 --> 35:39.473
but I, - I discriminate
against a lot of people.

35:39.475 --> 35:41.742
But I never had no quarrel
with the crackheads.

35:47.049 --> 35:48.382
What's this for?

35:48.384 --> 35:49.883
That's your home loan.
It's been approved

35:49.885 --> 35:52.452
by the Bank
of Uncle Daddy Big Bucks.

35:56.392 --> 35:59.126
- Are you sure?
- Hell, yeah, I'm sure.

35:59.128 --> 36:00.460
That's what my brother
would have done

36:00.462 --> 36:04.264
if he was still with us,
God bless his heart.

36:07.403 --> 36:09.803
That's you, baby. Bro, you
don't have to do this.

36:09.805 --> 36:12.940
Shh.

36:12.942 --> 36:15.442
I love you, man.

36:15.444 --> 36:17.377
God damn it, I love you, too.

36:19.181 --> 36:20.914
Go get you that house.

36:27.289 --> 36:29.323
Pol?

36:29.325 --> 36:30.524
Hey, y'all.

36:30.526 --> 36:33.527
- Hey, Pol.
- Hey.

36:33.529 --> 36:34.895
How you doing?

36:34.897 --> 36:36.463
Fine.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.067
It was bad, wasn't it?

36:40.069 --> 36:42.469
Why didn't you tell us
you had something going on?

36:42.471 --> 36:43.971
I didn't want to face it.

36:43.973 --> 36:45.606
You were yelling a lot
for Lillian.

36:45.608 --> 36:46.974
You want us to call her?

36:49.245 --> 36:52.179
Lilly died when we were 13.

36:53.249 --> 36:54.314
Mnh.

36:54.316 --> 36:55.816
Babe...

36:57.920 --> 37:00.120
She was precious.

37:00.122 --> 37:03.390
We used to do everything
together.

37:03.392 --> 37:06.493
We weren't just twins.
We were best friends.

37:08.597 --> 37:12.065
We finished each other's
sentences, you know?

37:12.067 --> 37:14.034
I mean, sure,
we were competitive,

37:14.036 --> 37:16.436
but we loved each other.

37:16.438 --> 37:19.973
Well, can I ask...
Um, how did she die, Pol?

37:19.975 --> 37:23.644
We also loved ice-skating

37:23.646 --> 37:24.745
and Debi Thomas.

37:25.915 --> 37:27.915
We used to copy all her moves.

37:27.917 --> 37:30.651
That's what up.

37:30.653 --> 37:33.253
And my mom told us
not to go out there.

37:33.255 --> 37:35.088
She said the ice was thin.

37:35.090 --> 37:38.425
But we didn't listen.

37:38.427 --> 37:39.927
We knew better.

37:39.929 --> 37:42.329
And she fell through.

37:42.331 --> 37:44.965
It was just an accident.
I tried to save her.

37:44.967 --> 37:46.566
I did.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.503
But she slipped away.

37:49.505 --> 37:51.438
And I think about it
every day, you know,

37:51.440 --> 37:54.441
but I just... I try to block it.

37:54.443 --> 37:56.343
But something
about Marnie leaving me

37:56.345 --> 37:58.145
just brought it all back up.

37:58.147 --> 37:59.613
- Hey.
- It's okay.

37:59.615 --> 38:03.150
I-I don't... I don't know...
I don't know what to do.

38:03.152 --> 38:05.352
But you will
get through this, okay?

38:05.354 --> 38:07.287
But... But...
But what if I can't?

38:07.289 --> 38:09.289
- We will help you.
- Yeah.

38:09.291 --> 38:11.258
- We got you.
- We're right here.

38:11.727 --> 38:12.993
Okay. Okay?

38:12.995 --> 38:14.594
Okay. Okay.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.366
What do you want now?

38:24.368 --> 38:26.735
You didn't tell the truth.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.838
You okay, Pol?
Is it happening again?

38:29.840 --> 38:32.708
Yup. You want me
to get the doctor?

38:32.710 --> 38:37.079
Lillian had a crush on the boy
that I liked...

38:37.081 --> 38:39.148
David Wyatt.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.318
Everyone saw them kissing.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.754
And it made me so mad.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.756
She was always trying
to one-up me.

38:47.758 --> 38:51.059
She was always trying
to beat me at everything.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.163
And I just got so tired of it,

38:54.165 --> 38:56.398
you know, so...

38:58.836 --> 39:01.069
What, baby?

39:02.306 --> 39:03.572
I pushed her,

39:03.574 --> 39:05.774
and she fell through the ice.

39:08.245 --> 39:11.113
And I didn't help her at first.

39:11.115 --> 39:14.116
I just watched
as she went under,

39:14.118 --> 39:18.220
and then, when I did try,
it was too late.

39:18.222 --> 39:20.856
Pol. Pol, you were a kid.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.792
But I didn't save her.
I didn't save her.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.462
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:28.899 --> 39:30.466
I waited too long.

39:30.468 --> 39:31.533
Come here.

39:34.605 --> 39:36.205
It's okay.

39:42.813 --> 39:43.912
She's gone.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.817
Pol, listen to me.

39:48.819 --> 39:51.553
The minute you figured out
what was happening,

39:51.555 --> 39:53.322
you tried to help,
but... but maybe

39:53.324 --> 39:55.357
her skates weighed her down.

39:55.359 --> 39:56.525
I mean, what if
you would have pulled

39:56.527 --> 39:57.893
and more ice would have broken

39:57.895 --> 39:59.761
and both of y'all would have
fell in and died?

39:59.763 --> 40:00.963
We don't know.

40:00.965 --> 40:05.067
But what is for sure...
That's your past.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.669
Baby, you got to
leave that thing there.

40:07.671 --> 40:09.338
You got to move forward, Pol.

40:12.643 --> 40:14.309
I don't know, Des.

40:14.311 --> 40:16.812
I think
I've wasted all this time,

40:16.814 --> 40:21.416
you know, trying to just be
anything but what I am.

40:23.554 --> 40:24.953
I'm broken.

40:26.290 --> 40:29.191
Polly Pol, we are all broken.

40:29.193 --> 40:32.427
I know,
but I wanted to be great.

40:32.429 --> 40:34.897
I wanted to be...

40:34.899 --> 40:37.499
great.

40:37.501 --> 40:40.602
I spent my whole life
reaching for greatness.

40:42.506 --> 40:46.008
But Lillian was right.
I'm just delusional.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.443
I'm never gonna be a Kennedy.

40:48.445 --> 40:51.813
You're never gonna be married
to the man of your dreams.

40:51.815 --> 40:54.816
I mean, we're never gonna be
anything but...

40:54.818 --> 40:56.685
just ordinary.

40:56.687 --> 40:58.520
And what's worse than that?

40:58.522 --> 41:00.455
Don't say that. It's true!

41:00.457 --> 41:03.258
We're just ordinary.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.726
Polly Pol,

41:04.728 --> 41:09.364
you are anything but ordinary?

41:09.366 --> 41:12.267
You have a sunny,
twisted demeanor.

41:12.269 --> 41:14.236
You are the heart
and red-headed soul

41:14.238 --> 41:15.537
of this group.

41:15.539 --> 41:18.874
And the way you are
with those boys?

41:18.876 --> 41:20.809
They look up to you.

41:20.811 --> 41:23.145
Your clientele has tripled.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.880
Baby...

41:24.882 --> 41:29.418
if nothing else, girl,
you are an excellent madam.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.653
Hashtag facts.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.255
I mean, I tried to
get out from underneath

41:33.257 --> 41:34.590
this bullshit, too, Pol,

41:34.592 --> 41:37.726
but the truth is,
we're good at it.

41:37.728 --> 41:40.495
Yeah, but what happened to you
wanting to get out of it?

41:43.567 --> 41:48.170
We are criminals, Polly,

41:48.172 --> 41:50.339
and it's time we own it

41:50.341 --> 41:53.208
and we take what belongs to us.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.344
I like how you're thinking.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.846
- I got a mind for this thing.
- Yeah.

41:57.848 --> 42:01.216
And it's time
we stopped fighting that.

42:01.218 --> 42:03.819
Come here.

42:04.888 --> 42:07.055
- We're gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

42:07.057 --> 42:09.391
- Walk backwards.
- Okay.

42:09.393 --> 42:11.293
Okay. Keep... I feel
like I'm gonna fall.

42:11.295 --> 42:12.761
No, no, no, you won't fall.

42:12.763 --> 42:14.463
But keep your eyes closed.
Hold on.

42:14.465 --> 42:15.864
Let me open the door.

42:15.866 --> 42:16.965
Okay.

42:16.967 --> 42:18.133
Keep your eyes closed.

42:18.135 --> 42:19.635
I will. Turn around?
Okay. Turn around.

42:19.637 --> 42:20.936
But keep your eyes closed.

42:20.938 --> 42:22.004
Okay.

42:22.006 --> 42:23.872
Okay.

42:23.874 --> 42:26.408
Okay, okay.

42:26.410 --> 42:28.210
- You ready?
- Yeah.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.213
Okay. Open your eyes.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.449
- Wait a minute.
- Wow.

42:37.955 --> 42:42.457
I have all your favorite snacks,
labeled, and your kombucha.

42:42.459 --> 42:45.127
Yep, I cleaned that
nasty-ass mold.

42:45.129 --> 42:47.696
I cleaned
the bathroom by myself,

42:47.698 --> 42:50.565
and I labeled and folded
your socks and underwear.

42:50.567 --> 42:53.402
Thanks, Virginia.
I-I-I really love it.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.703
Thank you. Do you?

42:54.705 --> 42:56.505
Yeah. Yeah.

42:56.507 --> 42:57.839
- Hey. Look at me.
- Yeah?

42:57.841 --> 43:00.976
- Yeah.
- We can't rely on anybody else.

43:00.978 --> 43:02.577
Okay. Okay?

43:02.579 --> 43:06.415
Yeah. We have to rely on
each other, just me and you.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.418
Just us. Yeah.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.686
Yeah.

43:18.896 --> 43:19.995
Hey.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.763
You seemed
a little mad at me earlier,

43:21.765 --> 43:23.765
so I... I thought we could talk.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.472
Hey.

43:30.474 --> 43:31.707
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:31.709 --> 43:34.009
I just, um, wanted to stop by

43:34.011 --> 43:37.512
and, say hi
and see how y'all was doing.

43:37.514 --> 43:38.747
O-We're great.

43:38.749 --> 43:40.749
W-We're better than great, yeah.

43:40.751 --> 43:45.520
Good. I want you to know,
baby, that I love you.

43:45.522 --> 43:47.422
Dean, look at me.

43:47.424 --> 43:50.092
Yeah. I love you.

43:50.094 --> 43:52.627
And no matter what...

43:52.629 --> 43:55.130
I just want you to know
you're not broken.

43:55.132 --> 43:58.800
Who told you I was broken?
M-My vertebrae is 100% intact.

43:58.802 --> 44:02.003
No, no, no.
That's not what I mean.

44:02.005 --> 44:05.540
I'm just saying
I know that it might seem like

44:05.542 --> 44:07.943
me and my crew are messed up.

44:07.945 --> 44:09.911
Hell, maybe we are.

44:09.913 --> 44:12.547
But you don't deserve that,
okay?

44:12.549 --> 44:15.917
And I'm happy
that you moved out.

44:15.919 --> 44:19.955
I'm proud of you, baby.

44:19.957 --> 44:21.022
You are?

44:21.024 --> 44:23.058
I am, yes.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.861
Really?

44:25.863 --> 44:27.062
Really.

44:30.367 --> 44:31.500
Okay.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.668
Are you... Are you gonna

44:33.670 --> 44:35.737
really marry Dr. Ruval tomorrow?

44:35.739 --> 44:40.342
I am, yeah.
It's the only way to end this.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.810
So, your sister
will be putting on

44:41.812 --> 44:43.979
the performance of a lifetime.

44:43.981 --> 44:44.913
Okay.

44:44.915 --> 44:47.582
So, c-could I give you away?

44:47.584 --> 44:49.251
Since we don't have a dad.

44:49.253 --> 44:50.886
I mean, I-I-I could, you know...

44:50.888 --> 44:53.822
I mean, I could, you know,
pretend to do it.

44:53.824 --> 44:55.524
I would love that.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.893
Okay. We're family, and I...

44:57.895 --> 44:59.795
Okay, you know what?
You're not gonna make me cry.

44:59.797 --> 45:00.896
Des, don't... Don't cry, Des.

45:00.898 --> 45:02.831
I'm not. No. We're family.

45:02.833 --> 45:04.332
We're a family.

45:04.334 --> 45:06.535
Family forever.
I love you so much.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.403
I love you, Des.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.280
Hi.

45:18.282 --> 45:20.448
What?

45:20.450 --> 45:22.083
I-I thought you left.

45:22.085 --> 45:25.987
Let's do "True Colors"
for old time's sake.

45:25.989 --> 45:27.956
What? We don't have any skates.

45:27.958 --> 45:30.525
We don't need skates.
