In the criminal justice system,

00:03.171 --> 00:04.605
sexually-based offenses

00:04.638 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.543
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.577 --> 00:11.179
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.212 --> 00:12.713
are members of an elite squad

00:12.746 --> 00:14.582
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.251
These are their stories.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.323
Multiple stab wounds.
Neck snapped.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.292
Pervert's at it again.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.626
[sirens]

00:25.659 --> 00:27.595
It's about time
the canine unit got here.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.766
Detectives,
got another Jane Doe.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.834
Same M.O.
as the others.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.570
Judging from rigor,
been dead maybe 20 minutes.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.572
Killer could be
one of the looky-loos.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.142
Perp gets off watching us
clean up his mess.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.179
Go get him, Angus.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.747
Come on, find the scent.

00:49.217 --> 00:52.353
Hey, bloody corpse over here.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.222
Stupid mutt can't even
hit his mark.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.423
Cut!

00:55.456 --> 00:56.690
Reset!

00:56.724 --> 00:59.360
Tony, find what's-his-name,
the trainer.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.761
His dog just
ruined my shot.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.830
I need a 20
on the dog wrangler.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.265
What's up with this dog?

01:04.298 --> 01:05.699
[barking]
Where the hell's he goin'?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.569
Hey c'mon, get outta here.

01:08.602 --> 01:11.139
What are you
howling at, boy? Get away.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.341
Jessie?

01:13.374 --> 01:15.309
Jess, you okay?

01:15.343 --> 01:16.410
Jessie!

01:18.346 --> 01:20.214
Jessie!

01:20.248 --> 01:21.415
Franco Marquez,

01:21.449 --> 01:23.617
executive producer
of Girl, Undercover.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.453
That's Jessie.
She's my star.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.854
What happened?

01:26.887 --> 01:28.322
Looks like the perp
bashed her head

01:28.356 --> 01:29.357
into the kitchenette
and raped her.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.591
(Fin)
She gonna be okay?

01:30.624 --> 01:31.692
Pupils are reactive.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.327
She's responding
to painful stimuli,

01:33.361 --> 01:34.828
but the ER
will have to scan her.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.231
What just happened?

01:37.265 --> 01:39.167
(Marquez)
I found her lying
right here on the floor.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.701
Who has access
to Jessie's trailer?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.803
Just the crew.

01:42.836 --> 01:43.904
Security has strict orders.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.207
No one's allowed on the set
unless they work for me.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.142
Anyone on the crew
have a problem with Jessie?

01:48.176 --> 01:50.911
No, we've been together
for three seasons.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.215
I know it sounds cornball,
but we're like family.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.316
(Fin)
What's all this?

01:55.349 --> 01:58.686
Jessie the Slut?
Teen Tramp?

01:58.719 --> 01:59.853
Rag magazines.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.322
They have a field day

02:01.355 --> 02:03.191
any time that Jessie
wears something slinky.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.359
She ain't wearing
much of anything here.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.360
"Jezebel Jessie"?

02:06.394 --> 02:07.695
It's just words.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.430
Sticks and stones, right?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.265
(Stabler)
"The world will be
a better place

02:11.299 --> 02:15.203
once we're rid
of Jessie Dawning."

02:15.236 --> 02:18.239
Sticks and stones, huh?

03:12.360 --> 03:13.861
Tox screen found enough
opiates in her system

03:13.894 --> 03:15.663
to knock out Lennox Lewis.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.331
Any chance she took
those pills herself?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.600
Well, she didn't
give herself the contusion.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.601
Okay, so he drugs her,

03:20.634 --> 03:22.370
maybe she starts
to come to,

03:22.403 --> 03:23.904
then he puts her down
for the count.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.706
(Jessie)
I don't want to talk to them!

03:25.739 --> 03:27.641
Started yelling
the minute she woke up.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.576
For a second there,

03:28.609 --> 03:30.944
I thought her head
was gonna start spinning.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.646
Why are you doing this to me?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.714
I don't know!

03:33.747 --> 03:35.716
Ms. Dawning.
Detective Stabler--

03:35.749 --> 03:37.418
I don't remember
anything, okay?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.686
I went to take a nap
in my trailer,

03:38.719 --> 03:40.388
next thing I know,
I wake up here.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.922
You have anything to drink
before you fell asleep?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.691
Just a diet soda
with lemon on the set.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.692
Who gave it to you?

03:44.725 --> 03:45.693
I don't know.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.760
It was just by my chair.

03:46.794 --> 03:47.828
Where the hell
are my shoes?!

03:47.861 --> 03:48.862
Jess, listen,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.331
you have to talk
to the police.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.799
I've gotta go.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.967
We have, like, no time before
the entire world finds out.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.438
Please, I just
want to go home.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.707
Now, she's 16 years old.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.342
She can't sign herself
out of a hospital

04:01.375 --> 04:02.743
without her parents'
consent.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.012
They're in California.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.348
Jessie was emancipated
when she was 14,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.583
so they could stop
blowing through her money.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.685
She doesn't need
their permission.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.687
Where were you
when Jessie was raped?

04:13.721 --> 04:15.723
I know how this works.
I write this for a living.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.358
I'll give you
a DNA sample,

04:17.391 --> 04:18.726
and so will everyone else
on the crew.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.694
You write this for a living,
you should know

04:20.728 --> 04:21.962
that you can't
compel them to do that.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.432
They're like
her big brothers.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.767
Last week, a couple of nut bags
egged Jessie's trailer.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.936
The grips were on them
like the Secret Service.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.771
Who were
these nut bags?

04:30.804 --> 04:33.307
Carolyn Spencer
and her anti-smut brigade.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.842
They're always
picketing our set.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.876
What do they have
against your show?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.845
They think that Jessie

04:37.878 --> 04:39.880
is corrupting the morals
of our youth.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.915
You know that quote
about getting rid of Jessie?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.786
Spencer's the one
who said it.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.890
The world will be
a better place

04:49.923 --> 04:51.759
once we're rid
of Jessie Dawning?

04:51.792 --> 04:52.693
Did you say that,
Mrs. Spencer?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.027
I didn't mean it
literally.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.729
So how did you
mean it?

04:55.763 --> 04:56.864
Just that I wish
my daughter

04:56.897 --> 04:58.399
had better role models
than Jessie Dawning.

04:58.432 --> 05:01.369
Jim, where's that one
of her in her underwear?

05:01.402 --> 05:04.872
This is what
young girls aspire to today.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.740
Not this--this is what
they'd kill to be.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.442
A half-naked size two.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.577
Mom, we're running late.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.379
I don't think
we're gonna make the bus.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.746
Danny, I'm busy today.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.081
I can't drive you.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.549
Dad would.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.885
Well, then,
go live with him.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.987
I can take them.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.022
School's on my way
to work, anyway.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.824
Thank you,
Mr. Willoughby.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.527
I don't see what makes Jessie
such a bad role model.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.362
She's young, successful.
What's wrong with that?

05:28.396 --> 05:29.430
Look at this.

05:30.798 --> 05:34.602
16-year-old
done up like a hooker.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.937
We don't want that
marketed to fifth graders.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.872
Let the network
move the show to 10:00,

05:38.906 --> 05:41.008
I'll shut up.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.010
People think they can't
do anything about this trash.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.813
I'm proof that one person
can make a difference.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.916
Last season, the FCC
fined the network twice

05:48.949 --> 05:50.418
just for content.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.019
They listen
to my group now.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.421
Were you
and your group

05:53.454 --> 05:55.889
picketing Jessie's set
yesterday?

05:55.923 --> 05:57.525
Yeah, 'til about 3:30.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.593
Why are you asking?

05:59.627 --> 06:00.761
Did something
happen to Jessie?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.630
Is she okay?
She's fine.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.865
We just need to know which
of your members were there.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.769
I'll get you
my membership list.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.870
Neighbors Investing

06:09.903 --> 06:11.472
in Clean Entertainment.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.940
Well, they've got
over 800 members.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.843
Its stated mission
is to protect the children.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.811
In their newsletter
it says,

06:17.845 --> 06:19.780
"A 12-year-old girl
was raped in California,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.949
walking home
in leather bra and panties."

06:21.982 --> 06:23.484
It was her
Halloween costume.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.619
She was dressed up
as Girl, Undercover.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.922
This website has got
over 100,000 hits.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.424
It's not just about Jessie.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.825
There's a list
of dirty movies,

06:31.859 --> 06:33.927
music, radio shows.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.195
"Click here
to complain

06:35.228 --> 06:36.864
"to the FCC.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.466
"Click here to learn
which corporate sponsors

06:38.499 --> 06:39.933
to boycott."

06:39.967 --> 06:42.536
Click here so your children
will never again be exposed

06:42.570 --> 06:45.072
to the mind-warping trauma
of a nipple on television.

06:45.105 --> 06:48.976
Olivia, the Extradition Express
leaves in half an hour.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.911
You miss that plane,
you're gonna be on the red-eye.

06:50.944 --> 06:51.912
I'm out.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.881
Okay, what are the chances

06:53.914 --> 06:55.716
that a member
of this NICE group

06:55.749 --> 06:57.485
had anything to do
with Jessie's rape?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.686
Looks like all they do

06:58.719 --> 07:00.588
is write letters
and picket.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.022
Crime scene report
from Jessie's trailer.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.458
CSU lifted her prints
off the soda she was drinking

07:04.492 --> 07:05.559
before the rape.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.694
It wasn't spiked.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.795
They found these--

07:07.828 --> 07:11.031
a dozen different pain killers
and sleeping pills.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.502
Oxycontin, Vicodin,
Percocet.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.106
All these were refilled
the day of the rape.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.011
(Stabler)
You knew Jessie
was taking pills.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.646
Why did you lie?

07:25.679 --> 07:28.916
Well...it's been
a tough season.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.219
How Jessie gets through it
is between her and her doctor.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.087
Jessie goes undercover
as a stripper...

07:34.121 --> 07:36.890
as a lifeguard,
as a lingerie model.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.026
You know, maybe the kid
wouldn't have such a hard time

07:39.059 --> 07:40.761
if you didn't make her
run around

07:40.794 --> 07:42.129
half-naked every week.
You know--

07:42.162 --> 07:43.997
Oh...

07:44.031 --> 07:44.865
There's my star.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.934
Shouldn't you be home
taking it easy?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.202
I didn't feel like
being alone.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.939
Can I just sack out
on your couch?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.675
Well, they're just giving me
a lack-of-progress report.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.876
Give me two minutes.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.682
We've been through enough.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.183
I don't need you bitching
about how Jessie

08:03.216 --> 08:05.853
is playing
inappropriate material.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.721
Look, pal, basically,
you got her stripping for money.

08:07.755 --> 08:08.956
And sleeping with
the teacher?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.992
It's called drama.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.061
It's called
pimping out a 16-year-old

08:14.094 --> 08:15.663
to jack up your ratings.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.230
The average girl
loses her virginity by 16.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.899
Now, what's the responsible
thing to do?

08:18.932 --> 08:19.867
Pretend it doesn't happen?

08:19.900 --> 08:22.936
Or show a girl
in charge of her sexuality?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.237
A 16-year-old girl

08:24.271 --> 08:25.706
may be having sex,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.007
but she ain't
in charge of squat.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.875
You don't know Jessie.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.910
You wanna see
how in-charge she is?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.211
Watch the show.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.981
And then do your job,

08:34.014 --> 08:36.984
and go find the son-of-a-bitch
that raped her!

08:41.088 --> 08:44.024
(TV announcer)
She may look like
the girl next door.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.160
but this is no ordinary girl.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.296
She's smokin' hot.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.831
But she's just 16.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.567
You can look,

08:53.601 --> 08:55.535
but you better not touch.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.840
This girl has a badge

08:59.873 --> 09:00.974
and a black belt.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.984
Redlight to central,
we have a problem.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.621
I broke another heel.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.956
(announcer)
Jessie Dawning is:

09:19.627 --> 09:22.362
16-hour days
pretending to be a hooker,

09:22.395 --> 09:25.365
and the other eight
pretending to be a grown-up.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.001
No wonder the kid
knocks herself out with pills.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.703
No parents, no friends.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.104
Everyone from her doctor
to her boss

09:31.138 --> 09:32.372
lined up to get something
out of her.

09:32.405 --> 09:36.810
68 DNA tests--every man
on the Girl, Undercover crew.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.079
No matches to the fluids
found inside Jessie,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.948
but I got a cold case hit
off the DNA.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.683
One of the crew members,
wanted for grand larceny

09:42.716 --> 09:45.052
and aggravated assault.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.820
Franco Marquez.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.858
No way!
I didn't do it!

09:50.891 --> 09:52.760
Well, DNA
puts you at the scene.

09:52.793 --> 09:56.664
It's--it's not my DNA.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.267
Whose is it?

10:00.300 --> 10:04.004
This out-of-work
actor that I know.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.640
I paid him
for his sample.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.042
I gave him a studio ID badge
with my name on it,

10:09.076 --> 10:10.410
and drove him
to the ME's office.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.748
I wonder why you'd
fake your DNA.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.186
I want to make
my phone call now.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.389
(Cragen)
I'm sorry about this,
but the law says

10:22.422 --> 10:24.925
we can't keep him from
calling anybody he wants,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.794
even his victim.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.996
(Stabler)
We'll make sure he doesn't
bother you anymore.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.998
What did he tell you?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.365
He clammed up
pretty quickly,

10:32.399 --> 10:33.967
but, uh, he's in trouble.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.903
He's just trying
to protect me.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.872
He knows it'll kill my image
if he tells the truth.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.709
The truth about what?

10:45.178 --> 10:49.016
Lucky for me my folks'll
do anything for a buck.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.320
A marriage license.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.188
Signed by Mom and Dad.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.925
Cost me a couple
of Porsches.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.693
I figure it's a small
price to pay

10:59.727 --> 11:01.228
to sleep with my husband.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.773
Marquez is 40.
Jessie is 16.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.274
It's legal pedophilia.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.142
So she had
consensual sex.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.310
She took a fistful
of knockout pills,

11:17.344 --> 11:18.278
fell, and hit her head.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.980
But the ME report
says Marquez

11:20.013 --> 11:22.215
isn't the only one
who had sex with Jessie.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.351
The rape kit turned up
a pubic hair.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.353
DNA doesn't match Jessie,
Marquez,

11:26.386 --> 11:27.755
or anybody on the crew.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.389
We're gonna base
a whole rape investigation

11:29.422 --> 11:30.323
on a single pube?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.292
We don't even know
if she was raped here.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.928
It's the best evidence we got
so we're gonna run with it.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.129
She could have
picked up that hair

11:36.163 --> 11:38.198
during one of her
costume changes.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.967
I don't think they
change their panties, Elliot.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.135
We gotta find out who else
was on the set that day.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.937
Bunch of paparazzis.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.073
Couple of tabloids today
have pictures of Jessie

11:46.106 --> 11:47.440
being taken away
in an ambulance.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.142
Third one went
a little bit further.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.277
What kind
of bottom feeder

11:50.310 --> 11:51.344
sneaks into
a girl's hospital room

11:51.378 --> 11:52.913
and takes her picture?

11:52.946 --> 11:55.182
Same kind that sneaks
into her trailer and rapes her.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.317
I'll get a subpoena for
the hospital security cameras.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.352
You two talk to Marquez
and Jessie.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.453
See if they saw anybody
hanging around

12:00.487 --> 12:03.356
outside her room.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.958
I spent the whole night
by Jessie's bed.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.426
I didn't see anyone
but doctors and nurses.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.361
Here's the ledger
photograph.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.162
Now,
the hospital monitor

12:09.196 --> 12:11.331
says the photo
was taken at 5:08.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.165
Your chair is empty.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.101
Why would he
take the stupid picture?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.769
I went to get some coffee
around 5:00.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.137
He must have
taken it then.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.506
These photos were taken
right outside Jessie's set.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.841
You know by who?

12:20.874 --> 12:21.842
Probably the same losers

12:21.875 --> 12:23.844
who are camping outside
of our house right now.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.978
You know
any of their names?

12:25.012 --> 12:26.313
There's, like,
a million of them.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.447
I can't sneeze,

12:27.480 --> 12:28.816
it doesn't
end up in the tabloids.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.550
Jessie walks her dogs,
Jessie buys a tampon.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.286
It's three years now
they've been stalking her.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.989
Couple of weeks ago, I go to
pick my car up from the valet,

12:36.023 --> 12:37.190
and this guy
just jumps in.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.325
I think
he's a carjacker.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.326
All he does

12:39.359 --> 12:40.861
is take
my picture and run off.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.162
What did he look like?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.397
He looked like a big flash
going off in my face.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.899
(Fin)
You tell the police?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.868
Yeah, they wrote down
a bunch of crap

12:47.901 --> 12:49.469
and then asked
for my autograph.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.504
[cell phone rings]

12:51.538 --> 12:53.306
The cops said
there wasn't much

12:53.340 --> 12:54.975
you can do about
invasion of privacy.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.376
It would have been
a different story

12:56.409 --> 12:58.011
if he would have
touched her.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.949
Guess it's a different story
now, huh?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.450
(Fin)
All right, thanks
for the information.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.453
Captain checked out
the surveillance tape

13:06.486 --> 13:07.888
from the hospital.

13:07.921 --> 13:11.391
Guess who checked in
on Jessie at 5:08.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.326
You violated
a patient's privacy.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.394
I was pre-rounding.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.362
I checked her IV
and her vitals,

13:15.395 --> 13:17.297
and then I moved on
to my other patients.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.531
You were the only one
in Jessie's room

13:18.565 --> 13:20.067
when this picture
was taken.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.935
You know the trouble
I'd get in for that?

13:21.969 --> 13:24.371
I'd lose my job,
probably my license.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.372
Why would I risk it?

13:25.405 --> 13:27.908
People do a lot
of stupid things for money.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.410
What'd they pay you?
20 grand, 30?

13:30.443 --> 13:31.511
No.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.047
We got you on
the security camera.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.456
I owe $90,000
in student loans.

13:43.490 --> 13:47.360
This photographer
offered me 50.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.996
Look, if you don't
want your picture taken,

13:49.029 --> 13:52.365
be a school teacher, not some
international superstar.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.367
You have no right
questioning me.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.903
We're not done here.
Just relax, okay?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.504
Where were you
Tuesday afternoon...

13:57.537 --> 13:59.539
Say about 4:30?

13:59.572 --> 14:02.442
I don't get off
on raping 16-year-olds, okay?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.344
Prove it to us.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.513
I was trying to get
a shot of Jessie.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.948
On the set.
I'll show you.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.316
Okay.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.018
All my photos
are time stamped.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.519
Not that I got anything.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.286
She is pretty good
at dodging us.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.222
Maybe if you stopped
stalking her,

14:15.255 --> 14:16.289
she wouldn't have to run.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.125
She needs us
as much as we need her!

14:18.158 --> 14:19.259
I'll tell you something,
the minute someone

14:19.292 --> 14:20.593
stops taking your picture,

14:20.627 --> 14:23.196
that's the minute
you become a has-been.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.397
Here ya go, right here,
all right?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.499
4:28.
I was outside the set.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.502
Who are these guys?

14:29.536 --> 14:31.438
Couple of morons.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.539
Security caught them
sneaking on set.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.242
What about this guy,
with his back turned to us?

14:35.275 --> 14:36.676
I don't know.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.113
Maybe the third moron
got in.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.949
All we wanted was a pair
of Jessie's panties.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.283
It was just a prank.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.184
Security says
you told them

14:44.217 --> 14:46.954
it was to get on
the BJ Cameron radio show.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.255
Yeah, BJ wants to know

14:48.288 --> 14:49.456
if she wears a thong
in real life

14:49.489 --> 14:50.991
like she does
on the show.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.525
And if you can prove
that they're her panties,

14:52.559 --> 14:53.560
he'll put you on the air.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.562
That's what shock jocks
are up to these days, huh?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.530
They tell their listeners
to steal an actress' panties?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.431
BJ's pretty wild.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.233
You should check out
the show sometime.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.035
I like my comedy
funny.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.403
There was a third kid
with you.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.537
Where is he?

15:04.571 --> 15:05.438
No clue.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.506
We met him there that day,
hanging out.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.376
Told him about the panty raid,
said he wanted in.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.011
Then he wienered out
at the last minute.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.512
Waits for us
to get busted,

15:12.545 --> 15:14.714
and then sneaks past
while security's distracted.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.216
Ass clown.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.485
You remember his name
or what he was wearing?

15:18.518 --> 15:19.552
He said his name
was Speed,

15:19.586 --> 15:21.421
like that's not made up.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.555
He looked like
a regular kid.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.324
Kind of full of himself,
though.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.393
Kept bragging that if
he didn't get Jessie's panties,

15:26.426 --> 15:28.361
that he was gonna
take a picture of her trailer

15:28.395 --> 15:30.130
to get on BJ's show.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.401
It's all talk.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.736
I don't tell them
to actually do anything.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.038
No, of course not,

15:38.071 --> 15:39.572
then you'd be liable
for their actions.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.608
Well, legally,
I could do a whole lot more.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.743
But with Big Brother
all up in my business,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.645
I don't wanna get fined.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.647
Did you suggest
that your fans rape Jessie?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.416
Rape ain't funny.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.485
The panty thing I said
to piss off the uptight bitch.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.553
She's 16 years old.

15:53.586 --> 15:54.988
Why are you trying
to piss off a kid?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.523
She comes on my show,

15:56.556 --> 15:58.225
only wants to talk
about her craft,

15:58.258 --> 15:59.726
like I could give
a rat's ass.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.661
I say let's hear
about your titty job.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.696
She walks off
mid-interview,

16:03.730 --> 16:05.565
I have to fill up
the rest of the hour

16:05.598 --> 16:07.667
with a call-in show.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.602
About Jessie
the uptight bitch.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.738
Yeah, callers were
totally pissed off at her.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.506
I said she needed
a good banging

16:13.540 --> 16:14.607
to loosen her up.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.344
That sounds like another one
of your suggestions to me.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.678
I didn't say rape her.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.547
On in five, Beej.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.149
Listen, I don't
like Jessie,

16:22.182 --> 16:24.151
but I do like
ragging on her.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.285
It's good for ratings.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.554
Doesn't mean
I wanna see her hurt.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.291
The BJ Show is back with two
of New York's finest,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.661
talking about the bangtastic
Jessie Dawning.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.529
Put on some headphones,
fellas!

16:36.563 --> 16:37.630
[laughs]

16:37.664 --> 16:39.566
Anyway, let's hear it for...

16:39.599 --> 16:42.035
You want mail, we got it--
threat mail, fan mail,

16:42.069 --> 16:44.771
hate mail, not to mention
thousands of emails.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.706
A lot of people
write in about Jessie?

16:46.739 --> 16:48.375
Yeah, especially since
she walked off the show.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.177
Ton of guys fantasizing
about doing dirty things to her.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.679
Okay, we'll take
everything you've gotten

16:52.712 --> 16:54.614
in the last month.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.150
Yeah?
Happy to help the fuzz.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.719
You guys know
BJ's harmless, right?

16:59.752 --> 17:00.753
He's just playing.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.723
It only takes one crazy.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.459
"Roses are red,
violets are blue,

17:06.493 --> 17:09.129
when Jessie's dead,
her corpse I will"--

17:09.162 --> 17:11.364
You get the rest, and there
are hundreds of them like this.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.134
This BJ guy really
brings out the best in people.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.236
And we got a transcript
from the BJ show.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.805
"I'd like to break Jessie down
like a shotgun

17:18.838 --> 17:20.673
and fill her full
of slut shot."

17:20.707 --> 17:22.175
This is BJ talking,
not some fan.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.610
This guy makes a living
demeaning women.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.777
And two million
rabid fans

17:24.811 --> 17:26.746
tune in every day
to hear him do it.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.715
They want sex and violence.
Why not give it to them?

17:28.748 --> 17:29.516
He's encouraging
people to rape.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.651
What, "Jessie
needs a good banging.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.120
Go out and give it to her."

17:33.153 --> 17:34.387
This guy
knows his law, though.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.555
He's protected
under Brandenburg,

17:35.588 --> 17:37.357
unless his intent
is to go out and produce

17:37.390 --> 17:38.591
an imminent and probable
lawless act.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.160
I mean,
he could say to you,

17:40.193 --> 17:41.761
"Elliot Stabler, I command you
to rape Jessie Dawning."

17:41.794 --> 17:42.695
You wouldn't have
a case against him.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.597
How is that possible?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.133
He doesn't really
mean for you to do it.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.134
It's a joke.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.335
Except this time,

17:48.368 --> 17:49.569
someone really
went out and did it.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.238
Well, there's
your bad guy, not BJ.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.739
They're both just as bad.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.474
Elliot, you're "O" for 3.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.742
There's no intent,
no imminent act,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.110
and no likelihood
that his words

17:57.144 --> 17:59.512
would be taken seriously.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.414
Our rapist took BJ seriously.
He e-mailed him.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.785
(Stabler)
"To BJ, your wish
is my command."

18:05.818 --> 18:07.854
Hair's in her face,
but that's Jessie

18:07.887 --> 18:09.822
in the same clothes she was
wearing when she was raped.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.458
Her couch and her trailer.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.560
Couple of more pictures were
attached to the same e-mail.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.895
That's the NICE picket line.
Carolyn Spencer.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.797
And this.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.572
Who's that?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.174
Carolyn Spencer's son,

18:27.207 --> 18:29.142
Danny.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.315
Mrs. Spencer, this is an arrest
warrant for your son Danny.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.783
What? W-wait, you can't
just barge in--

18:36.816 --> 18:38.285
What are you
talking about?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.353
He raped Jessie Dawning
Tuesday afternoon.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.754
That's ridiculous.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.890
No, he comes home
from school every day

18:43.923 --> 18:45.558
and goes right to his room.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.160
This is wrong.
You've made some mistake.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.395
You thought
he was home Tuesday.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.197
Here he is with Jessie.
What is this?

18:50.230 --> 18:51.831
Your son took that
with his camera phone

18:51.864 --> 18:53.666
and sent it
to The BJ Cameron Show.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.236
He's a shock jock.
I know who he is.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.870
Go back to your room.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.880
Daniel Spencer,
you're under arrest

19:07.914 --> 19:09.716
for the rape
of Jessie Dawning.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.784
What?
I didn't rape anybody.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.220
It's okay, honey.
It's all a mistake.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.321
No mistake.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.626
That look like
a mistake to you?

19:20.827 --> 19:23.196
What did you do?
Tell me, what did you do?

19:23.230 --> 19:24.397
I didn't do anything.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.533
I was just trying to get
on The BJ Show.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.301
That show is not allowed
in this house!

19:28.335 --> 19:29.869
You promised!
Mom...

19:29.902 --> 19:31.838
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.907
It's all right, honey.
It'll be all right.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.812
I didn't rape her.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.315
Then explain these.

19:47.820 --> 19:51.391
I--I snuck
into her trailer...

19:51.424 --> 19:53.260
to steal her panties...

19:53.293 --> 19:55.895
so that I could
get on The BJ Show.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.497
She was sleeping, so...

19:57.530 --> 20:00.267
I took some pictures.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.934
And then--

20:01.968 --> 20:02.969
You raped her.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.304
He did not rape anybody.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.938
She woke up.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.911
I told her I was a fan.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.946
I read her this poem
that I'd written for her.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.215
She--she thought
it was nice.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.020
Then we did it.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.889
So you read her a poem,

20:22.922 --> 20:24.324
and then she just said,

20:24.357 --> 20:25.992
"That's nice.
Let's have sex."

20:28.661 --> 20:30.697
Let's hear the poem.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.832
It's--it's private.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.833
It's a crock!

20:33.866 --> 20:36.035
What about the cut on her head?
How about that?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.271
I don't know--must have
happened after I left.

20:38.305 --> 20:39.839
Why are you so surprised?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.007
This girl is a slut.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.343
My son did a stupid thing,

20:43.376 --> 20:44.544
but he is not a criminal.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.712
(attorney)
There was no rape.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.716
Just two teenagers
having consensual sex.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.921
You believe
this poem crap?

20:54.954 --> 20:55.988
(Stabler)
We've got to ask.

20:56.022 --> 20:56.923
Why?

20:56.956 --> 20:58.991
Just because I make out
with boys on TV

20:59.025 --> 20:59.992
doesn't make me a whore.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.295
A suspect gave us
his version of what happened.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.930
It's what his lawyers
are gonna say in court.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.065
We need to hear
your version.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.668
The only man I've
ever slept with is Franco.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.337
Why would I just
all of a sudden

21:10.370 --> 21:11.871
sleep with a stranger?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.840
Okay, okay.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.942
Do you recognize
the boy who raped you?

21:21.781 --> 21:22.815
No.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.620
Danny Spencer's DNA matches
the hair from Jessie's rape kit.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.021
He's our guy.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.890
She still didn't pick him out
of the photo array.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.925
Well, if toxicology report
confirms her story,

21:32.959 --> 21:35.495
she was too stoned to remember,
she was too stoned to consent.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.697
Unfortunately,
the tox screen can't specify

21:37.730 --> 21:39.065
her level of awareness.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.933
It just shows she took
a whole lot of pills.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.869
So she's a pill head.
She's still a rape victim.

21:42.902 --> 21:43.970
Whom the defense will say

21:44.003 --> 21:45.037
is a sexually precocious
drug addict

21:45.071 --> 21:47.740
who's prone to blackouts.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.842
She practically had
a pharmacy in her trailer.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.679
And her co-star will testify
that she threw herself at him.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.114
Either way, Danny Spencer's
version of events

21:55.147 --> 21:56.449
isn't a hard-sell.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.084
Especially
on the radio.

21:58.117 --> 21:59.952
I was flipping
the stations in the car,

21:59.986 --> 22:02.555
and who comes on The BJ Show
but Danny Spencer,

22:02.589 --> 22:03.990
talking about
his sexual encounter

22:04.023 --> 22:06.826
with everybody's
favorite floozy.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.128
(Danny, over head phones)
I mean, I don't know
where she's been...

22:09.161 --> 22:10.663
The dub will be done
in a minute.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.131
(BJ)
You rode that cow good, huh?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.001
Did you last
the mandatory eight seconds?

22:15.034 --> 22:16.503
What kind of dipstick

22:16.536 --> 22:18.004
goes in front
of two million people

22:18.037 --> 22:20.039
knowing they're gonna
be humiliated?

22:20.072 --> 22:22.108
Getting ripped on is a badge
of honor for BJ's fans.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.377
He's gonna get laid
left and right off of this.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.145
How'd Danny get on the show
in the first place?

22:26.178 --> 22:27.113
We called him.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.981
Five minutes later,
he calls us back and says,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.017
"I'll come on the show
if I can sneak out

22:31.050 --> 22:32.419
without my mom knowing."

22:32.452 --> 22:34.821
That's all she wrote.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.855
That's only
ten minutes worth.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.390
Where's the rest
of the interview?

22:37.424 --> 22:38.257
As far as we got.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.026
The station got so many
phone complaints

22:40.059 --> 22:41.728
about our "obscene show,"

22:41.761 --> 22:43.095
they yanked us
off the air.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.465
If we're not on the air,
we don't roll tape.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.934
It's a shame, too, it got cut
off just before the best part.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.002
What, something heavy
fell on BJ's head?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.439
No, when Danny told BJ

22:52.472 --> 22:55.174
Jessie was passed out
when he did her.

22:55.207 --> 22:59.779
Where is BJ right now?

22:59.812 --> 23:02.048
What possible reason
do I have to tell you anything?

23:02.081 --> 23:02.982
16-year-old girl was raped.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.418
Your testimony will put
a rapist in jail.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.721
That Danny kid's so screwed up,
he'd say anything for a laugh.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.524
What, did he think
raping Jessie was funny?

23:11.558 --> 23:13.826
You're not gonna get me
to talk about this.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.061
Why not?

23:15.094 --> 23:17.196
Because people like you
cut off my show.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.166
Did you get a big happy
when the anti-smut crusaders

23:20.199 --> 23:21.868
yanked my show
off the air this morning?

23:21.901 --> 23:24.103
(Fin)
You were humiliating
a rape victim.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.171
Great, take me off the air!

23:25.204 --> 23:27.940
You know what I find offensive?
Catcher in the Rye.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.842
Let's find every copy
and burn it.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.011
You're pissed off because
your show got pulled.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.213
I'm pissed off because
a couple of hundred crackpots

23:34.246 --> 23:36.483
want to decide
what's appropriate

23:36.516 --> 23:38.050
for two million people
to listen to,

23:38.084 --> 23:39.586
and you're letting them win.

23:39.619 --> 23:40.787
We're not trying
to shut you down.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.088
We're trying
to catch a rapist.

23:42.121 --> 23:45.692
And I'm exercising my right
not to speak.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.530
Son of a bitch
wants to turn himself

23:50.563 --> 23:51.998
into a martyr
for free speech.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.166
Didn't the producer hear Danny
admit to raping Jessie?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.802
BJ told him that
later,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.136
and his station
doesn't record

23:57.169 --> 23:58.270
unless
they're broadcasting.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.740
So we can't use the confession
unless BJ gives it up.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.074
You subpoena him,

24:02.108 --> 24:03.843
he's gonna turn that trial
into a free-speech circus.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.478
BJ likes whining
about his freedom of speech.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.213
Let's give him something
to really cry about.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.782
I'll take a page out
of Carolyn Spencer's playbook.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.518
How do you hurt
Howard Stern?

24:11.551 --> 24:13.185
Go after Clear Channel.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.055
So you're gonna put the screws
to Entropy Broadcasting?

24:16.088 --> 24:18.190
And their sponsors
and their advertisers.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.893
Ask them how they feel
about Entropy's star personality

24:20.927 --> 24:23.730
hindering the prosecution
of a rapist.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.168
The pinheads at Entropy

24:29.201 --> 24:31.938
say I gotta testify
against Danny Spencer

24:31.971 --> 24:33.640
if I wanna keep my show.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.175
Oh, I know.
It's tragic.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.645
Do you wake up
every morning and think,

24:38.678 --> 24:41.247
"How can I trample
on the first amendment today?"

24:41.280 --> 24:43.883
I wake up and think,
"How can I put away a rapist?"

24:43.916 --> 24:46.519
The only reason
you don't have a confession

24:46.553 --> 24:49.556
is the thought police
took me off the air.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.223
You want me
to let a rapist walk free,

24:51.257 --> 24:53.593
so you can stick it
to the thought police?

24:53.626 --> 24:56.996
If that's what it takes
to protect free speech, yeah.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.264
You know the deal.

24:58.297 --> 25:03.235
You testify
or your advertising goes away.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.237
Just tell me when to be there.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.874
I'll even wear a suit.

25:09.976 --> 25:11.277
What do I have to do?

25:11.310 --> 25:12.912
You'll go
on the stand first

25:12.945 --> 25:15.114
and then I'll
lead you through what happened.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.750
Everything,
including how he found me

25:17.784 --> 25:19.919
passed out on my couch?

25:19.952 --> 25:20.987
We can explain that.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.254
You'd been working
16-hour days.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.656
You were exhausted.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.658
Will I have to tell them
about the pills?

25:25.692 --> 25:28.294
If the defense
asks you, yes.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.196
Great.

25:30.229 --> 25:33.165
They're gonna say
I'm a slut and a junkie.

25:33.199 --> 25:37.570
I can't imagine how hard
this must be for you, Jessie.

25:37.604 --> 25:42.074
But your testimony will help
put your rapist in jail.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.978
Please.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.148
Can you just
do this without me?

25:49.181 --> 25:51.150
Carolyn,
this is a good offer.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.019
Danny only went on that show
to impress BJ.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.353
Danny confessed to rape!

25:54.386 --> 25:56.122
BJ Cameron is the one
you should be going after.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.323
Danny wouldn't
have done anything

25:57.356 --> 25:59.291
if BJ hadn't
egged him on.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.127
Mom!
You don't have
a say in this.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.829
Actually, he does.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.031
I am his mother.
You don't get to decide for him.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.099
You're here as a courtesy,
Mrs. Spencer.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.736
This is a one-time offer.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.237
Rape Three--
he does one to three

26:11.270 --> 26:13.005
and tells the court
everything he did.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.741
We should consider the deal.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.243
No!

26:17.276 --> 26:19.679
There is no way you can prove
he did anything wrong.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.048
It's his word against
that junkie tramp.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.883
And who do you think
the jury's gonna believe?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.718
I thought you were
a role model, Mrs. Spencer.

26:25.752 --> 26:29.188
Whatever happened to
teaching kids to tell the truth?

26:29.221 --> 26:34.093
I'm doing what's best
for my son.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.327
What's best for her son?

26:35.361 --> 26:37.163
She's all about
morals and decency

26:37.196 --> 26:38.798
until it becomes
inconvenient.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.200
I can bully BJ
onto the stand.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.002
I can present
all the evidence that I want.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.270
But without Jessie,
I got nothing.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.838
Any chance of talking
to Danny

26:45.872 --> 26:47.139
without Carolyn
running interference?

26:47.173 --> 26:49.008
And saying what--
ignore your mom?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.409
Listen to me
and go to jail?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.411
Okay, well, look...

26:52.444 --> 26:55.147
Maybe the guilt has been
eating away at this kid.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.216
Make him face
what he's done.

27:00.687 --> 27:03.155
My mom says I can't speak to you
without my lawyer.

27:03.189 --> 27:06.392
You don't have to talk.
You just listen.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.160
Look--

27:12.431 --> 27:15.267
Jessie.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.769
What are you
doing here?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.873
What am I supposed
to say to him?

27:20.907 --> 27:22.008
Look...

27:22.041 --> 27:24.744
I'm sure you hate me.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.313
Shut up!

27:27.346 --> 27:29.882
You don't get
to defend yourself.

27:29.916 --> 27:34.120
What you did to me...

27:34.153 --> 27:36.288
You think I'm trash,
don't you?

27:36.322 --> 27:38.057
No.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.359
No, I don't.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.061
But all those things
that BJ said about me

27:42.094 --> 27:44.030
you think are funny.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.165
Breaking into my trailer
and stealing my panties.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.136
It was just
a stupid prank.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.272
You call raping me
a prank?

27:57.844 --> 28:00.079
I wish I could
take it all back.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.784
I'm sorry.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.757
You're sorry?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.959
How could you be sorry
when you went on the radio

28:12.992 --> 28:15.728
and bragged
about what you did to me?!

28:18.497 --> 28:21.801
BJ started making jokes.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.736
I was just trying
to keep up.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.005
Was your mom just trying
to keep up, too,

28:26.038 --> 28:28.007
because...

28:28.040 --> 28:29.842
she said she wished
I was dead.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.077
No, no.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.511
She didn't mean it
like that, she was--

28:32.544 --> 28:33.846
She thinks she is so perfect,

28:33.880 --> 28:35.081
but all she does

28:35.114 --> 28:36.482
is give kids
somebody to blame

28:36.515 --> 28:39.385
when they do something wrong.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.388
Kids shoot up a high school--
blame Marilyn Manson.

28:44.423 --> 28:48.995
You raped me...

28:49.028 --> 28:51.463
blame BJ Cameron.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.302
Danny...

28:58.570 --> 29:02.274
You're the only one who knows
what really happened.

29:02.308 --> 29:06.345
You can own up to it
like a man.

29:06.378 --> 29:10.349
Or you can
hide behind your mother.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.495
(Judge)
Mr. Spencer, do you wish
to change your plea?

29:23.529 --> 29:25.564
I do, your honor.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.900
I plead guilty.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.268
And this is a decision
you've reached

29:29.301 --> 29:31.437
of your own free will,
with no coercion

29:31.470 --> 29:32.504
or undue influence?

29:32.538 --> 29:34.006
Yes, sir.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.541
Ms. Novak.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.076
All that remains
to satisfy the terms

29:37.109 --> 29:38.444
of the plea arrangement

29:38.477 --> 29:42.014
is for Mr. Spencer to allocute
the details of his crime.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.283
(Judge)
Go ahead, Mr. Spencer.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.792
I went to Ms. Dawning's work...

29:55.294 --> 29:58.397
thinking maybe
I could steal her underwear

29:58.430 --> 30:00.099
to get on
The BJ Cameron Show.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.601
I thought
that'd be cool.

30:02.634 --> 30:06.272
I'd maybe even
get some girls.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.307
I didn't think
she'd be in her trailer.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.508
I almost bolted

30:09.541 --> 30:10.409
when I saw her sleeping.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.178
Then I thought,
how cool would it be

30:12.211 --> 30:14.446
to get a picture
of her.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.282
So I took one.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.484
And she didn't wake up.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.089
I lifted up her skirt

30:23.122 --> 30:25.057
to take another,

30:25.091 --> 30:28.360
and she didn't wake up.

30:28.394 --> 30:32.631
I pulled down her panties,

30:32.664 --> 30:35.567
and I began
to have sex with her.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.904
I was wrong.
I was stupid.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.474
She started
to wake up a little bit.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.877
I pushed her away,
and I ran.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.950
I deserve to go to jail.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.521
I'm sorry.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.328
Are the people satisfied,
Ms. Novak?

31:02.361 --> 31:03.529
We are, your honor.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.197
Court officer,

31:05.231 --> 31:07.499
please remand Mr. Spencer
into custody

31:07.533 --> 31:09.969
pending a sentencing
hearing.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.237
Court is adjourned.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.638
[gavel strikes]

31:17.709 --> 31:19.145
You did the right thing,
Danny.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.546
Get away from him.
Hey, take it easy!

31:20.579 --> 31:22.481
Thanks.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.092
BJ walks outside,
goes right to the press,

31:33.125 --> 31:35.461
and tells them how happy he is
that justice has been served.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.329
A sound bite gets him
on the 6:00 news.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.598
His ratings go up.
The idiot's loving life.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.968
Not anymore.
That was a 2-7.

31:42.001 --> 31:45.071
Somebody just took a shot
at BJ outside his radio station.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.375
I'm dyin'!
Stupid bitch shot me!

31:49.408 --> 31:52.011
I'm Type "O" Negative.
I need a transfusion.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.280
You're gonna be fine.
Just take it easy.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.314
What happened?

31:55.347 --> 31:57.483
Took a slug
in the shoulder.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.519
Vitals are stable.
Not much blood loss.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.721
Who saw what?

32:02.754 --> 32:04.991
At least five bystanders
saw what happened.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.626
She walked right up to him
and pulled the trigger.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.675
Why did you do this?

32:23.709 --> 32:26.212
I had to.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.681
I couldn't let him
ruin another family.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.727
Here's my case.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.096
The attempted murder
of BJ Cameron,

32:44.130 --> 32:47.733
memorialized on film
by some shutter happy tourist.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.235
You're going to jail.
No deals.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.669
We don't want any deals.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.139
Carolyn shot BJ
because she was distraught

32:53.172 --> 32:54.406
over what he'd done
to her son.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.143
Extreme emotional disturbance
isn't gonna fly.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.710
She went
to the radio station,

32:58.744 --> 33:01.313
waited for BJ to come out,
and then shot him.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.015
He should be dead.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.184
He turned my son
into a rapist.

33:05.217 --> 33:06.352
He's ruined Danny's life.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.420
Danny ruined his own life.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.156
He wanted
to be a doctor.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.590
He wanted to help people.

33:11.623 --> 33:14.226
Until he started listening
to The BJ Show.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.128
Then he decided he didn't
want to go to college

33:16.162 --> 33:17.463
because BJ didn't.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.330
How many more kids

33:18.364 --> 33:20.399
do you think this man
is gonna ruin?

33:20.432 --> 33:22.401
So you didn't shoot BJ
just because of Danny.

33:22.434 --> 33:26.138
You did it to keep him
from corrupting other kids.

33:26.172 --> 33:29.441
No mother should
see her son go to prison

33:29.475 --> 33:33.512
because some foul-mouth pig
thinks rape is funny.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.282
And I'm guessing
there's at least one person

33:36.315 --> 33:37.816
out of every twelve
who will agree.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.651
Come on, Carolyn.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.424
What did I do?

33:45.457 --> 33:46.592
You don't even
say hi to your boss?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.360
Hi.
What did I do?

33:48.394 --> 33:51.063
Just wondering why you're taking
this Spencer case to trial.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.231
She doesn't want to plea.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.332
Her lawyer's going
with some bogus

33:53.365 --> 33:55.101
extreme emotional
disturbance defense.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.568
Bogus or not,
you take this to court,

33:56.602 --> 33:58.437
you could lose.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.838
Even the candid camera
helps her.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.373
You shoot someone
in broad daylight,

34:01.407 --> 34:03.442
you're obviously
not thinking straight.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.743
Police interview
the photographer?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.478
He was gone
by the time they got there.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.779
They're still looking,
but the paper

34:07.813 --> 34:09.648
won't give up a name
without a subpoena.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.450
I'll see
what I can do to help.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.386
In the meantime,
push harder for a plea.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.555
Carolyn Spencer
shot BJ Cameron

34:16.588 --> 34:17.556
because she's a zealot.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.158
We offer her
a slap on the wrist,

34:19.191 --> 34:20.292
it's just giving
a green light

34:20.326 --> 34:21.660
to every vigilante
in the city.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.196
Carolyn will be judged
by a jury of her peers.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.564
She's not
the only one out there

34:25.597 --> 34:28.367
sick of being surrounded
by trash like The BJ Show.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.236
BJ has the right
to say what he wants.

34:30.269 --> 34:31.603
Carolyn doesn't have the right
to shoot him.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.339
That's the law.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.241
But you get one overprotective
parent in your jury,

34:35.274 --> 34:37.609
you got yourself a mistrial.

34:44.550 --> 34:47.253
Did the defendant
appear distracted

34:47.286 --> 34:48.854
or even upset
when she shot you?

34:48.887 --> 34:50.556
She seemed totally calm.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.225
Walked up to me,
pulled a gun,

34:53.259 --> 34:54.393
squeezed the trigger.

34:54.426 --> 34:55.594
Thank you.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.596
Nothing further.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.601
In your show,
have you ever directed

35:02.634 --> 35:05.571
any of your listeners
to commit a violent act?

35:05.604 --> 35:06.505
No.

35:06.538 --> 35:09.408
I have here some transcripts
from your show.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.810
Would you please read
from the highlighted passage?

35:11.843 --> 35:13.445
"The Undercover bimbette

35:13.479 --> 35:15.414
"is nothing but
an uptight little bitch.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.549
She needs a good banging
to loosen her up."

35:17.583 --> 35:20.186
(attorney)
And this one.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.621
"Someone needs
to throw her down

35:22.654 --> 35:26.192
and nail her like she's never
been nailed before."

35:26.225 --> 35:28.760
But, according to you,

35:28.794 --> 35:31.863
these words were never meant
to incite violence

35:31.897 --> 35:33.599
toward Jessie Dawning.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.933
No.

35:34.966 --> 35:35.934
They're jokes.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.404
They were meant
to be funny.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.772
You see anyone laughing?

35:40.806 --> 35:44.243
I didn't use
my funny voice.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.412
No further questions.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.547
Redirect, your honor.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.649
Mr. Cameron,

35:50.682 --> 35:54.553
do you think that the KKK
or Aryan Nations are funny?

35:54.586 --> 35:55.687
Only in that they're

35:55.721 --> 35:56.955
the most ignorant
bunch of jackasses

35:56.988 --> 35:58.324
in the country.

35:58.357 --> 35:59.591
So you don't agree
with their views.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.527
But do you think they should
still be allowed

36:01.560 --> 36:03.429
to express them?

36:03.462 --> 36:04.896
They may be hate-mongering
idiots,

36:04.930 --> 36:07.599
but they still have the right
to speak their minds

36:07.633 --> 36:09.668
like everyone else.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.637
So as much as you
dislike their views,

36:11.670 --> 36:14.740
do you think it's okay
just to go out and shoot them?

36:14.773 --> 36:17.309
No.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.810
Thank you.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.546
Nothing further.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.684
Danny was--
he was the sweetest kid

36:25.717 --> 36:29.821
before he started listening
to The BJ Cameron Show.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.790
And then,
all of a sudden,

36:31.823 --> 36:34.860
women were "bitches"
and "ho's" and--

36:34.893 --> 36:37.529
Even his little sister.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.665
(defense attorney)
Wasn't it your job
as his mother

36:39.698 --> 36:40.932
to keep him in line?

36:40.966 --> 36:42.768
Yes, absolutely.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.671
But it was like there was
another parent in the house

36:45.704 --> 36:47.706
contradicting
everything that I said.

36:47.739 --> 36:48.874
Thank you.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.676
Your witness.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.680
BJ Cameron's demographics.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.949
200,000 listeners
under the age of 16.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.252
Only one rapist.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.587
So why did his show
affect your son

37:01.620 --> 37:04.390
differently
than the others?

37:04.423 --> 37:06.258
Danny didn't have
a male influence in his life

37:06.292 --> 37:08.594
after his father left.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.696
When he found BJ,

37:10.729 --> 37:13.365
he practically
worshipped him.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.666
Why didn't you
stop him from listening?

37:14.700 --> 37:16.034
I tried.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.469
He bought a radio
with his allowance,

37:17.503 --> 37:18.404
and he hid it from me.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.706
I work--I can't watch him
24 hours a day.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.709
Because you were too busy
trying to shut down The BJ Show.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.011
Objection!
Argumentative.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.813
I'll rephrase.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.682
Do you put your work
with N-I-C-E

37:30.716 --> 37:32.284
ahead of raising
your children?

37:32.318 --> 37:33.719
No.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.554
My job is about
protecting my children.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.622
But isn't it true

37:36.655 --> 37:37.756
that you shot BJ Cameron

37:37.789 --> 37:39.425
not because he
ruined your son's life,

37:39.458 --> 37:40.726
but because
he made a mockery

37:40.759 --> 37:43.362
of your crusade
to rid the world of filth?

37:43.395 --> 37:46.865
People like BJ
have taken over television...

37:46.898 --> 37:49.368
the Internet, movies, music.

37:49.401 --> 37:51.069
And you want to silence them.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.505
I want my children
to have a childhood.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.541
I'm all alone
raising two kids,

37:55.574 --> 37:57.543
and it is almost impossible

37:57.576 --> 37:59.044
to keep that obscenity
away from them.

37:59.077 --> 38:02.448
And that justifies
shooting BJ?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.786
That man...

38:07.819 --> 38:10.489
took away
everything I believe in.

38:10.522 --> 38:15.827
He took away my family.

38:15.861 --> 38:19.765
My baby's future.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.367
And I had to stop him.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.902
I didn't know
what else to do.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.717
You lose yet?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.118
I'm working on it.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.787
Told you.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.755
You put Carolyn Spencer
next to BJ,

38:43.789 --> 38:44.690
she's gonna look like
Mother Theresa.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.092
It's an extreme
emotional disturbance case.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.660
I can't object
to the defense

38:48.694 --> 38:50.429
painting a picture
of the heartbroken mother.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.831
You want to convince the jury
Carolyn's guilty,

38:52.864 --> 38:55.501
show them she's responsible
for her actions,

38:55.534 --> 38:57.002
just like Danny was.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.537
Wish I could
put him on the stand,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.005
but he won't say boo
against her.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.007
Maybe he'll change his mind
when he hears about this.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.975
Got a hold
of Mom's phone records.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.744
Look who his mom
was talking to

39:05.777 --> 39:07.513
right before
she shot BJ.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.082
Why are we here?

39:11.116 --> 39:13.419
People's exhibits
eight and nine.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.986
The defense hasn't
gone over those documents.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.588
You will.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.557
We're just waiting
on one more person.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.492
And here he is.

39:20.526 --> 39:22.861
Danny...

39:22.894 --> 39:25.130
Hey.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.466
(defense attorney)
Why is he here?

39:27.499 --> 39:29.735
So I can convince him
to testify against his mother.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.137
I told you no way.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.672
People's Exhibit Eight.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.941
A copy
of Carolyn Spencer's LUDS,

39:35.974 --> 39:37.175
showing two phone calls

39:37.208 --> 39:39.945
to NICE vice president
James Willoughby

39:39.978 --> 39:41.880
on the afternoon
BJ Cameron was shot.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.549
Is there a point
to all this?

39:43.582 --> 39:44.883
People's Exhibit Nine.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.552
Copy of the check
the New York Ledger

39:46.585 --> 39:48.119
wrote to the same
James Willoughby

39:48.153 --> 39:51.823
as payment for pictures
of BJ Cameron's shooting.

39:53.992 --> 39:57.128
Mr. Willoughby
took those pictures?

39:57.162 --> 39:59.798
You asked him to.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.768
Bet you didn't think anyone
would find out, did you?

40:02.801 --> 40:04.836
I don't know
what you're talking about.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.871
You talked to him

40:05.904 --> 40:07.939
for twenty minutes
that afternoon.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.841
You told him to take pictures
of the shooting.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.543
No, I didn't.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.846
We'll see what Mr. Willoughby
says on the witness stand.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.048
He'll say the same thing.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.717
You planned it?

40:18.750 --> 40:21.753
Why?

40:21.787 --> 40:23.722
So the whole world
would see her

40:23.755 --> 40:25.791
as a martyr
for her cause.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.094
It was just
a publicity stunt?

40:29.127 --> 40:31.129
No!
No, don't listen to her.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.964
I did it for you.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.036
You're so full of it.

40:43.241 --> 40:44.743
I want to testify.

40:46.745 --> 40:47.913
I'll tell them
she didn't shoot BJ

40:47.946 --> 40:49.114
because of me.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.248
I'll tell them
she just wanted

40:50.281 --> 40:51.817
to get her stupid crusade
on the news.

40:51.850 --> 40:52.884
No.

40:52.918 --> 40:56.021
I did it because
I love you.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.659
I wanna go back
to my cell.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.093
Danny, no!

41:02.127 --> 41:05.130
Wait, Danny, plea--
Danny!

41:09.167 --> 41:10.869
Last chance.

41:10.902 --> 41:11.937
I'll drop
the attempted murder

41:11.970 --> 41:13.972
if she pleads guilty
to assault.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.846
I didn't
do anything wrong.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.514
And this has all

41:22.548 --> 41:23.782
been fascinating,

41:23.815 --> 41:26.184
but it doesn't
prove a thing.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.021
Then we'll let a jury decide.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.130
(judge)
Mr. Foreman, you've been
deliberating for two weeks.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.999
What's the division of votes?

41:41.032 --> 41:42.634
Six to six, your honor.

41:42.668 --> 41:43.869
Is there any chance,
with more time,

41:43.902 --> 41:45.103
you could reach a verdict?

41:45.136 --> 41:46.171
We've tried.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.306
We're deadlocked.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.776
Then I have no choice
but to declare a mistrial.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.711
Yes!

41:52.744 --> 41:54.613
The defendant's bail
is continued

41:54.646 --> 41:57.082
pending the people's decision
for a retrial.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.217
[gavel pounds]

42:10.996 --> 42:11.930
How do you deadlock

42:11.963 --> 42:13.899
with a mountain of evidence
in front of you?

42:13.932 --> 42:16.201
The jury thought
BJ deserved what he got.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.570
He flapped his mouth
on the radio.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.305
She picked up a gun
and shot him!

42:20.338 --> 42:22.040
There's no question
who broke the law here.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.775
No, but after
hearing BJ on the stand,

42:23.809 --> 42:25.577
half the jury would have
done what Carolyn did.

42:25.611 --> 42:26.978
[knock knock]

42:27.012 --> 42:28.580
Gotta hear this.

42:32.618 --> 42:35.921
BJ's been in full rant mode
for the last five minutes.

42:35.954 --> 42:40.058
(BJ, on radio)
Carolyn Spencer's not just
a bitch with a capital "C,"

42:40.091 --> 42:41.893
she's a fascist who should be
tried and fried

42:41.927 --> 42:43.929
for crimes
against democracy.

42:43.962 --> 42:47.098
Strap her into old sparky
and shoot a million volts

42:47.132 --> 42:48.867
through that Nazi
brain of hers!

42:48.900 --> 42:50.869
Think they'll let me
pull the switch?

42:50.902 --> 42:53.138
And you wonder why people
want that guy to shut up.

42:55.073 --> 42:56.975
No one's forcing them
to listen.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.576
(BJ)
Let me tell you,
that woman is just--

43:00.078 --> 43:03.014
