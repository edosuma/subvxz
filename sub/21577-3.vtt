WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.160
Come on then, boys and girls!

00:03.200 --> 00:06.080
Follow me.
Straight on to the bus.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.960
-[Grindah] Are you excited?
-Michael, here we go. Come on.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.520
If everyone could get
on to the bus as quick
as possible. Thank you!

00:13.560 --> 00:15.760
-Angel, nice to see
you this morning.
-Morning, Angel.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.280
[director] <i> So is Grindah</i>
<i>making more of an effort now?</i>

00:18.320 --> 00:21.560
[Miche] <i> Er, yeah, and I like</i>
<i>that he's making an effort.</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:24.120
He's offering to help clean
round the house and all that,

00:24.160 --> 00:26.600
but I don't know, I just...

00:26.640 --> 00:28.960
I feel like maybe he's
trying a bit too hard.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.160
Hiya, I'm Tony.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.000
-Aly.
-All right?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.640
OK, well done, boys and girls.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.960
That was very good behaviour.
Well done.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.840
Thumbs up all round?

00:38.880 --> 00:41.960
-It was great. Are you excited?
-[all] Yeah!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.200
It's going to be a great day.
Well done.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.160
[Grindah] Ah,
I fucking love kids.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.600
Oh, fuck!

00:53.640 --> 00:56.480
How the fuck did they find us?

00:56.520 --> 00:59.320
"Snitches get stitches".

00:59.360 --> 01:00.960
Steves!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.040
Beef is part
of pirate radio culture,

01:03.080 --> 01:05.120
goes with the territory.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.440
[director] What would Robyn
think if you went
to war properly?

01:07.480 --> 01:09.440
If I had to go to war,

01:09.480 --> 01:12.160
so I'd sit down with her and
watch "Saving Private Ryans"

01:12.200 --> 01:16.800
and just make sure she knew that
I might not come back alive.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.320
Ah, no, no, no, no!
Stevie? Steves? Steves?

01:20.360 --> 01:22.880
No, not Steves. Stevie?

01:24.560 --> 01:27.160
He's freezing cold.
Do something!

01:27.200 --> 01:29.560
-Stevie, talk to me, mate.
-Eh?

01:29.600 --> 01:32.920
-Steve, hello? Can you hear me?
-Yeah, bruv,
I was sleeping, man.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.800
-You had your eyes open.
-Yeah, I sleep like
that sometimes.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.680
What were you saying?
Did they hurt you?

01:38.720 --> 01:41.480
-Who?
-We've been attacked.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.480
[Robyn bawls]

01:43.520 --> 01:46.600
-Oh, shit, Robyn.
-Sorry, mate.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.880
Ah, sorry, mate.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.840
-[ringtone]
-[Chabsie] Oh, hello.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.440
Yeah, Kevin.
What? Ah, for f...

01:56.480 --> 01:59.880
OK, don't worry, mate. Relax,
relax. I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.200
OK. All right, bye.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.000
Oh... You all right?

02:09.039 --> 02:13.280
Just a... Just a bit of brown
seepage from the... the roof.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.400
It's leaking again.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.120
All right?
See you lot in a bit.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.400
Maybe get a couple with me
and you as well though, Angel.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.320
Shall we get one
of the two of us?

02:29.360 --> 02:31.640
Might go and check on Angel,
see if she's all right.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no worries.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.920
-Shall I get up?
-Yeah, just...

02:36.960 --> 02:39.400
[director] <i> So what are you</i>
<i>doing to get Miche back?</i>

02:39.440 --> 02:42.400
I mean, look at me. I don't
want to be looking like this,

02:42.440 --> 02:45.200
but that's cos I'm working hard,
do you know what I mean?

02:45.240 --> 02:48.720
Like, done my hair,
pretend I'm a nice person.

02:48.760 --> 02:52.080
Me and Rahim's just been having
such a good laugh together,
actually.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.120
The stuff he comes out
with, he's mental!

02:54.160 --> 02:56.440
Do you want to go
and chat to him?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.960
<i>I'm a likeable sort of guy.</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:02.280
<i>I know how to put it on,
do you know what I mean?</i>

03:02.320 --> 03:05.440
<i>I constantly talk at someone
with a massive smile on my face.</i>

03:05.480 --> 03:09.480
Like, "Ah, where are
we going? To the museum?
I'm so excited. How are you?

03:09.520 --> 03:13.080
What a lovely day.
I love weather.
And you look great today.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.280
And I love the way you're
dressed. How are you?"

03:15.320 --> 03:19.400
Ooh, I just can't wait to
teach all these little guys
about the, erm...

03:19.440 --> 03:23.760
Great War and
Battle of Brighton, so...

03:23.800 --> 03:25.880
-Battle of Britain.
-Britain, yeah.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.880
No, I just meant, like...
Cos a lot of the, er, battles,

03:29.920 --> 03:33.360
the little ones, took place on
the beaches of Brighton, so...

03:33.400 --> 03:35.160
-Ah.
-Yeah.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.120
[Beats] Come on, boys,
we need to get this done ASAP,

03:37.160 --> 03:39.080
before the neighbours
start talking.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.400
Fair play to whoever done it.
It's quite neat, isn't it?

03:41.440 --> 03:43.720
Spray paint is quite difficult
when you're freehand.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.800
-They've done a good job.
-They've not fucking
done a good job, Steven!

03:46.840 --> 03:48.760
Here, start cleaning.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.360
-Sorry. Is that my toothbrush?
-Yeah.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.760
-Hiya.
-Just a random, unprovoked
piece of graffiti.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.680
-Bloody racist, isn't it?
-Yeah.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.880
Back at it. Hate crime.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.240
Get...get us out.
Get us...get me out.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.880
[they laugh]

04:07.080 --> 04:08.960
-Hurry up!
-All right.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.320
Come on, Steves,
you're still on the S.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.560
-Takes a while.
-I've done three letters.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.480
Yeah, but I've got a smaller
ratio cos I've got a toothbrush.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.800
Well, at least we don't
know what it said now.

04:18.839 --> 04:22.920
It says, "Nitch get stit".
It's like German.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.600
[Grindah]
Come on, guys, thank you.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.480
Straight through the two pillars
and you'll see the door.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.120
-Good.
-[ringtone]

04:35.360 --> 04:38.320
-What?
-Hello?

04:38.360 --> 04:40.400
<i>-Steves, are you with Beats?</i>
-Yes, bruv.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.360
<i>I'm not talking to you, Beats.</i>

04:42.400 --> 04:44.320
<i>-But it's Kold FM.</i>
-Nah, mate.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.720
<i>-We're under attack.</i>
-Don't care, mate.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.600
<i>-Come back, please.</i>
-I ain't coming back for shit.
Man's grown up now.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.680
Tell him about
the graffiti and...

04:51.720 --> 04:53.640
He said to tell you
about the graffiti.

04:53.680 --> 04:57.040
I don't care about the graffiti.
It's nothing to do with me.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.360
Kurupt might die without you.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.040
<i>It died years ago.</i>

05:02.080 --> 05:05.080
-You only left two weeks ago.
<i>-Don't care, not my problem.</i>

05:05.120 --> 05:08.640
Why don't you deal with them
little pussy holes
yourself, yeah?

05:08.680 --> 05:11.080
It's, er... It's just...

05:11.120 --> 05:13.640
Er, come on, everyone!

05:13.680 --> 05:16.200
Straight in your
groups of twos.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.200
<i>So are you worried that
Kold FM will take Kurupt out?</i>

05:19.240 --> 05:21.280
<i>I'm not worried, I know
they're gonna do that.</i>

05:21.320 --> 05:25.520
Kold will take Kurupt down
now the leader ain't there.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.600
They know the general has gone,
so what are they going to do?

05:28.640 --> 05:31.360
They're going to go
for the little prawns.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.240
-Yes, boss.
-Yeah, I spoke to Grindah.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.280
-We're on our own.
-OK.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.840
Front and rear windows
are very secure.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.760
Chabsie, we're
five storeys up, mate.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.960
The easiest place to come
through is the front door.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.880
Good point. Let's
check them out, as well.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.640
Cor blimey, mate,
that's a lot of cash, Stevie.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.800
You doing your
cage dancing again?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.800
Oh, no, this is my inheritance.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.480
I didn't get paid for cage
dancing, that was voluntary.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.720
<i>No, I don't think money's
changed me at all.</i>

06:03.760 --> 06:07.560
I bought a new pair
of trainers, but, no,

06:07.600 --> 06:09.640
apart from that, like,
I haven't changed.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.320
Literally, I haven't changed.
I've got the same...

06:12.360 --> 06:15.400
clothes on that I had
before the money.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.640
We're just going to shoot
to the shop, Nana,

06:17.680 --> 06:20.840
and we're going to get some
stuff to reinforce the door.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.720
Keep your money safe. [laughs]

06:23.760 --> 06:25.600
[Chabsie] Right.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.240
Hello, boss.
Oh, perfect, security.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.400
-Yeah, that's a good bit of kit.
-That's good, yeah. Locks.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.960
That's a good one.
Look at the girth on that.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.080
-That's at least three inches.
-Oh, they've got a safe!

06:37.120 --> 06:39.000
-Maximum strength.
-Oh, perfect.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.800
Digital, steel safe.
I'm going to get one of them.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.600
Chabsie, maybe you
distract that geezer

06:44.640 --> 06:46.600
so I can just run
out with this, cos it...

06:46.640 --> 06:49.000
What? You're not just
going to pay for it?

06:49.040 --> 06:51.080
Yeah, I could just pay for it.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.280
Get it, get it, mate.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.560
-I'm going to treat myself.
-Treat yourself, mate.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.200
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.880
-I'd like to buy this today.
-Great.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.360
Great. Also, there's
a couple more bits.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.960
It's all fallen down.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.480
Don't worry, I'm paying
for all this, it's not...

07:16.520 --> 07:17.800
Er...

07:17.840 --> 07:20.080
Some of them, as well.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.120
Got a lot down there, huh?

07:24.160 --> 07:27.960
That is probably it, unless...
Do you want anything else?

07:28.000 --> 07:32.200
Listen, boss, do you
sell porta potties?

07:33.560 --> 07:35.320
-No, sorry.
-No?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.880
I'm just going to get
some air fresheners then.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.800
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.920
OK, guys, listen up!
Everyone, listen up.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.240
OK, so you all know
who your groups are.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.680
-Now, we're going to be
handing out some...
-Oh!

07:48.720 --> 07:51.120
-..worksheets
to your team leaders.
-Take one, hand it on.

07:51.160 --> 07:55.440
Now, the first group to get
all the questions right wins.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.640
Wins? What? A competition?
What do we win?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.040
You win the title
of best group.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.560
Wait, let me get this...
So if we win,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.480
it means we're better than
everyone else in here, yeah?

08:09.520 --> 08:12.840
-I suppose so.
-OK, just come here.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.920
-Right, so...
-We've got to be the best, yeah?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.560
We can't let any of these other
little dickheads win, all right?

08:18.600 --> 08:22.000
Spud man, come on, yeah.
Don't fuck this up, yeah?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.000
The one thing I learnt
at school, yeah,

08:24.040 --> 08:26.280
was that I have to win
at everything.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.440
Cos back then all the little
kids used to laugh at me
for losing and that.

08:29.480 --> 08:33.039
Not any more though.
These days I can walk through
any playground like a man,

08:33.080 --> 08:36.280
knowing that I'm better than
any of these tiny little neaks.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.400
Now who's laughing?

08:38.440 --> 08:41.280
Everyone ready?
Three, two, one, go!

08:43.240 --> 08:45.520
Leave the slow ones behind,
come on!

08:45.560 --> 08:48.360
Well, you just need to
stay in your pairs, yeah?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.960
And, Angel, you're going to go
in a pair with Mummy, yeah?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.160
I want to go with Carly.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.120
Yeah, but blood is thicker than
water, Angel, so you're not.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.760
Why wouldn't you just
go in a pair with me?

08:57.800 --> 08:59.640
You've always gone
in a pair with me.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.320
Ever since you were in my tummy.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.560
But she's my best friend.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.720
Well, who's Mummy meant
to be pairs with?

09:10.720 --> 09:13.720
If they come in now
I'll be like,

09:13.760 --> 09:16.680
"Oh, no, don't come in."
Whack!

09:16.720 --> 09:19.920
[voices outside]

09:19.960 --> 09:22.200
Do you hear that?

09:28.440 --> 09:31.280
-Thought you were
the Kold FM boys.
-No, no, no.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.040
Thank God for that.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.960
-Air freshener?
-Don't worry about that.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.120
Look what I've got.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.960
Get it all in, get it all in.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.320
-Sick! Is that a safe?
-Yeah.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.440
Thought it's good to keep my
nan's money, like, safe, innit?

09:47.480 --> 09:51.320
-Yeah.
-Means I can stop hiding
it in her buggy, as well.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.440
There's a couple
of different ones,

09:54.480 --> 09:57.160
-but I went for
the electronic one, so...
-Oh, nice.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.120
You just lock it, put in a
random code and then, bang!

10:04.640 --> 10:07.240
No getting into that.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.320
So what's the code?

10:10.320 --> 10:11.920
It's random.

10:13.360 --> 10:16.440
Yeah, but it's like
a secret code.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.440
And you put your
secret code in.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.440
-Exactly, no one knows.
-And then it opens it.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.920
But now you can't open it
cos you don't know the code.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.120
Yeah, but only I know the code,
that's the whole point.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.160
So put it in.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.000
[safe beeps]

10:32.280 --> 10:33.760
Yeah...

10:33.800 --> 10:36.000
Can't remember what to put.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.360
-Exactly.
-Too random.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.880
Fuck me, Steves,
you're an idiot.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.960
Planes. Got big wheels,
hasn't it?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.320
[laughs] It's like a car. Erm...

10:48.360 --> 10:52.400
This one's sort of a sausage
shape and this one's
more sort of...

10:52.440 --> 10:55.200
Yeah, sort of greyish.

10:55.240 --> 10:58.480
And this is a photo,
which is in black and white

10:58.520 --> 11:01.720
because they couldn't afford
colour film in those days, so...

11:01.760 --> 11:03.600
When did the war end?

11:03.640 --> 11:06.400
Oh, right, we're doing the
worksheet, are we? Boffin.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.880
OK, so, if we don't know
the answer to a question,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.920
we need to do some research,
and how do we research?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.320
We can look at the information
points next to each...

11:15.360 --> 11:17.680
No, incorrect. Angel,
do you know the answer?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.520
-Google?
-Yeah, good. OK, so everyone
get their phones out, please.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.880
-Isn't that cheating?
-Shh! Shh! Shh!
Fingers on lips, everyone.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.400
-Hurry up, you freaks!
-Get your phones out.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.080
You in the back, hurry up!
Come on, quick!

11:29.120 --> 11:33.240
Wait! Stop, stop, stop!
Is this a Spitfire?

11:33.280 --> 11:35.920
Read the sign!
Is it a Spitfire?

11:35.960 --> 11:38.760
<i>I think it's really sweet that
Grindah's making an effort,</i>

11:38.800 --> 11:42.080
and obviously there is the
saying "too little, too late".

11:42.120 --> 11:44.120
And I'm not saying that
I'm saying that saying,

11:44.160 --> 11:47.000
but obviously it
could potentially be
too little too late,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.120
I guess, yeah.
Watch this space.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.160
Oh, you're learning not to be a
little freak for once. Come on!

11:53.200 --> 11:55.120
Hurry up!

11:55.160 --> 11:58.160
Jesus! Hurry up, you freak!

11:58.200 --> 12:00.160
Is there actually
something wrong with you?

12:00.200 --> 12:02.200
Cos if there is then we're
going to leave you behind.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.040
Well, then, come on!

12:04.080 --> 12:06.520
Oh, what?
There's loads of planes!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.880
-We're never going to find it!
-Whoa!

12:08.920 --> 12:12.600
[safe beeps]

12:12.640 --> 12:16.520
This is what they do in the
films. Normally works, actually.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.160
[safe beeps]

12:19.200 --> 12:22.200
Yeah, no, I'm only
getting loud beeps.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.320
Give me the bat.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.840
-I'm going to get Chabsie.
Chabsie!
-Yes, boss?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.520
How do you break into a safe?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.600
-You want to use that?
-Cool.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.120
Aaagh!

12:47.160 --> 12:49.680
You fucked it, Steves.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.680
We need to draw a plane.
Get to the front and
draw it when I'm in it.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.120
Ah, this is sick.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.000
Ah, we'll blow all the other
teams' heads off, won't we?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.960
-[all] Yeah!
-Oh, come on then, let's go.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.600
You draw that flag.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.840
-Are you having fun, yeah?
-[all] Yeah.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.280
Are you having fun or not?
Do you want five detentions?

13:11.320 --> 13:13.520
OK, so you're having fun, yeah?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.600
-Yeah!
-No.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.600
-We're having such a good
time with these...
-No!

13:17.640 --> 13:20.600
Ah, you! Come on.
Do you want to get out?

13:20.640 --> 13:23.040
[Chabsie] All done, boss.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.680
So look at this. Got all
the keys here, mate, yeah?

13:26.720 --> 13:29.760
-That one's for the top one, OK?
-OK.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.840
This one there.
That one for that one.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.280
That one for that one.
This one for that one.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.240
So they're all here, OK, boss?

13:39.280 --> 13:41.400
<i>If your station
is secure enough,</i>

13:41.440 --> 13:44.160
then no one should
be able to get in.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.840
<i>It don't matter what
they do on the outside.</i>

13:46.880 --> 13:50.480
Do you mind getting that one,
actually? And the bottom one?

13:50.520 --> 13:53.200
Ready?
One, two, three, and lift.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.040
You seen that film "Panic Room",
with Jodie Fosters in?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.800
[director] Yeah.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.920
We're going for
that sort of vibe.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.840
Cos you said there were seven,
but I can only see four.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.720
There's four on here, but
there's actually seven
locks on the door.

14:06.760 --> 14:10.320
There's three ghost locks
and they're actually
the most impenetrable.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.520
No one's going to be able to
get into this place, man.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.960
I'm going to take this to
the top of the blocks
and chuck it off.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Try and, like, smash it open.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.840
-All right, Steves.
-See you in a bit.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.920
Right, let's test her out.

14:23.960 --> 14:27.280
Integrity test, yeah?
Good idea, let me just...

14:28.800 --> 14:30.640
Shit, bruv.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.320
Let me...

14:32.360 --> 14:34.000
-What have you done?
-Shit, um...

14:34.040 --> 14:36.800
I left the keys in there.
We're locked out, so...

14:36.840 --> 14:39.280
Oh, you fucking donkey!
Robyn's in there.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.960
Oh, good idea. Robyn!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.840
Listen, there's seven keys
on the counter.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.360
-She's not saying anything, man.
-Are you thick? She doesn't
even speak English yet.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.520
She's not going to understand
your weird, stupid accent.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.640
-Of course.
-Robyn!

14:52.680 --> 14:55.840
Robyn! Stay calm!

14:55.880 --> 14:58.040
Daddy's going to save you!

14:58.080 --> 14:59.840
What? V-I.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.400
-ET.
-E-T.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.680
-N.
-Wait!

15:02.720 --> 15:04.480
-N. Yeah?
-A.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.840
A. M. OK, good.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.680
-Tony? Tony?
-S. Come on!

15:08.720 --> 15:10.360
If I could just have you...

15:10.400 --> 15:13.080
Look, can you just take it
down a notch?

15:13.120 --> 15:16.000
We need these worksheets to
last till the end of the day.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.160
Someone's worried about losing.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.920
Trying to get in my head?
Ain't happening, mate.
Let's go, come on!

15:21.960 --> 15:23.520
-Mr...
-[Grindah laughs]

15:27.360 --> 15:29.760
Ah, sick! Chinook!
Let's get in!

15:32.440 --> 15:34.320
We're better than you!

15:34.360 --> 15:36.480
Right, just ignore him.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.960
Mr Zografos obviously
is a little bit excited.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.560
Fuck's sake, man, should have
brought our weapons out with us.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.720
We're vulnerable. Fuck!

15:45.760 --> 15:48.200
-[ringtone]
-Oh, shit!

15:48.240 --> 15:50.160
Hello, Roche.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.480
How are you?

15:52.520 --> 15:56.200
No. Yeah, no, everything's fine.
Yeah, cool, cool.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.200
Yeah, cool, cool.

15:58.240 --> 16:00.240
Just at studio
with Robyn and the boys.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.600
Cool, cool, cool.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.480
I'm not saying "cool" loads.
Everything's fine.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.560
Yeah, I can get milk.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.320
This is definitely
going to work.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.280
Just going to go
for the launch.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.200
Sorry! That's mine!

16:28.200 --> 16:30.280
I didn't think about this bit.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.280
Excuse me, mate!

16:32.320 --> 16:36.040
Er, could you just look
after that for me?

16:37.120 --> 16:39.200
What would your nan want
you to do with the money?

16:39.240 --> 16:42.240
That's partly the stressful
thing about having the money

16:42.280 --> 16:44.480
is I don't really know what
she wanted me to do with it.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.000
So I'm just holding on to it
for now and just spending it on

16:48.040 --> 16:51.080
just little things,
like essentials, like,

16:51.120 --> 16:53.680
food and, like, weed and that.

16:53.720 --> 16:57.120
Ah, thanks, you lot.
Sorry for that.

16:57.160 --> 17:00.040
Right, I'll bundle it.
Excuse me!

17:00.080 --> 17:02.960
Excuse me! What's she doing?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.440
She just fucked off with the...
Sorry, bruv, no, no, no!

17:06.480 --> 17:08.640
No, no, that's... Bruv!

17:08.680 --> 17:11.480
It's actually my...
It's my inheritance money.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.640
Ah, for fuck's sake!

17:14.680 --> 17:17.400
Waste of money, innit?

17:22.280 --> 17:25.359
Angel, do you want to come
and have lunch with Mummy?

17:25.400 --> 17:28.319
Shall we scooch up
so I can just fit in?

17:28.359 --> 17:31.360
Erm... There's no room.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.080
Right.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.920
-You all right?
-Yeah. You all right?

17:42.960 --> 17:44.680
How's the quiz going?
Got many left?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.520
Well, how many have
you got left?

17:46.560 --> 17:49.240
Fuck knows. My group are
all stuck-up little bitches.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.840
You made your own packed lunch?

17:53.880 --> 17:56.960
-Yeah.
-Did you leave the crust
on your sandwiches though?

17:57.000 --> 18:00.040
Yeah, it's actually quite long
to get them off, so just...

18:00.080 --> 18:02.400
I don't really mind
about this any more.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.880
Changed quite a lot, see?

18:09.360 --> 18:10.640
Oh!

18:11.720 --> 18:14.120
It is quite dry,
the crust, innit?

18:15.600 --> 18:17.640
Ah, that's better.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.840
Look, I've got a coat hanger,
mate. This normally works.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.800
-[Robyn cries]
-I can't wait any more, Chabsie.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.160
-What? What?
-This is insane.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.440
Robyn, I'm coming!
Daddy's coming!

18:30.480 --> 18:33.440
What are you doing, man?
Easy, man, watch the door.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.960
Oh, my God! Our door!

18:38.040 --> 18:42.560
<i>When you're a dad, you sort of
get this superhuman strength.</i>

18:42.600 --> 18:46.400
<i>Like, if your child is at any
risk you basically turn
into Wolverine.</i>

18:46.440 --> 18:50.400
But obviously without
the blades bursting out
of the skin and that.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.520
That would be hard to
look after a baby with all
that madness going on.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.880
Daddy's here. I'mma save you.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.160
I'm sorry about that.
I'll never leave you again.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.360
Oh, look at this.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.640
Oh, my God!

19:10.640 --> 19:13.120
What's it saying?
Is it...is it gone?

19:13.160 --> 19:15.520
Yes, mate, locks
are definitely broken,

19:15.560 --> 19:18.760
which is a real shame because
they were put on beautifully.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.880
Yeah, we're open to attack
right now, mate,

19:20.920 --> 19:23.560
and we don't even have
a front door, so, please.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.600
Listen, mate, if it does come
down to a fighting situation,

19:26.640 --> 19:29.640
they're going to have
to get through me first.
I'm getting sick of it, mate.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.000
If they come down, what I'm
going to do, first thing,
yeah, right in the eyes, yeah?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.920
Grab them by the throat,
like that, bang, yeah? Ankle...

19:35.960 --> 19:38.720
<i>I know so much about fighting,
yeah? And when it comes
to fighting...</i>

19:38.760 --> 19:40.400
you don't need to punch a man.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.000
Wait there one sec. Show me.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.240
<i>You grab him by
the throat, he's out.</i>

19:45.280 --> 19:47.760
-Yeah.
-Body lock.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.920
Body lock, like that, yeah?

19:49.960 --> 19:51.560
Like that and then tickle him.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.400
<i>He wakes up.</i>

19:53.440 --> 19:55.680
He's pissed himself
on the floor, lying there.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.560
-That's too far, man.
-Yeah, sorry, mate.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.960
<i>"Chabuddy G, I'm not
fucking with him again."</i>

20:01.000 --> 20:05.280
No fingerprints, no blood.
It's cleaner.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.400
Apart from the piss, obviously.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.240
-You know...
-Just do the door.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.720
Yeah, sorry, man.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.880
[Miche] The army men were
so fit then, weren't they?

20:15.920 --> 20:19.280
Yeah. Reminds me a lot of
myself back in the radio days.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.440
-A few weeks ago.
-Yeah.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.120
-Just real, strong,
proper men saving the world.
-Yeah.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.000
Like I used to with my lyrics.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.000
Do you not miss it?
I feel like this isn't you.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.440
You're not a teacher.
You're a soldier.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.200
You're right.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.360
Even my mum used to say it.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.600
She used to say I was her
brave little soldier.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.520
Of course I'm not a teacher.
Teachers are pathetic!

20:47.560 --> 20:50.440
I'm built for more.
I'm a soldier.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.440
I'm a soldier!

-What? Stevie, is that you?
-Yeah, man.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.000
-What's happened
to the fucking door?
-Hold on one minute.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.880
-Did they come?
-Oh, yeah. No, no. No.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.400
-They been here?
-I'll explain later. We had a
bit of an issue, but it's cool.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.920
-Steves, you got it open, yeah?
-Yeah.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.480
Had a bit of a "Crystal Maze"
moment in the car park,
but I got most of it back.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.320
All right, Nan? Are you
fuming at me about the money?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.960
I'll put it all under the bed
again. It's safer there, innit?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.760
Steves, take the bat.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.800
-What?
-Take it.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.880
You're on guard duty.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.000
Have I got to hit people?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.880
But I've never hit anyone.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.000
How long have I got
to be on guard duty?

21:44.040 --> 21:46.600
You're doing 12 hours on,
12 hours off.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.720
We need to invent some sort
of password or something.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.560
All right, cool.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.240
Jesus!

21:53.280 --> 21:55.240
Listen up, people!

21:55.280 --> 21:57.440
I've got a little
announcement to make.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.640
Shh! Come on,
turn around this way.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.480
Being here today
has inspired me,

22:02.520 --> 22:05.080
and it's made me realise
that I shouldn't be here.

22:05.120 --> 22:09.760
I'm a general. I've got my own
war to fight - the Kold War.

22:09.800 --> 22:12.440
And I'm ready to die
for my lyrical freedom,

22:12.480 --> 22:15.520
cos I am Kurupt FM
and no one can take me down.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.240
Mr Zografos,
would you mind st...

22:17.280 --> 22:19.200
Rahim, mate, you wouldn't
understand, yeah?

22:19.240 --> 22:21.760
My work here is done. The kids
know what they're doing.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.760
I've inspired them already,
and to be honest,

22:23.800 --> 22:26.080
I'm bigger than all this
teaching bollocks, yeah?

22:26.120 --> 22:29.560
Right now I'm needed
on the front line.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.360
Miche...

22:31.400 --> 22:33.360
I'll see you soon.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.320
This is your time.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.400
It is my time.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.880
[Miche] <i> All men have to fight.</i>

22:39.920 --> 22:42.280
<i>A real man does
what needs to be done.</i>

22:42.320 --> 22:45.440
<i>No, he's not scared
and he doesn't care
what other people think.</i>

22:45.480 --> 22:47.960
In a bit. Make sure you lot
lock into 108.9, yeah?

22:48.000 --> 22:51.200
That's the kind of man I want.
Someone who fights for
what he believes in

22:51.240 --> 22:53.200
and looks good in a cap.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.800
[Rahim] OK, if your group
joins me over here...

22:59.040 --> 23:02.480
We've got to be ready for war,
for whatever happens, mate.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.920
-Yeah.
-Ready to die.
If we're going to go out,

23:04.960 --> 23:08.280
we've got to go out like men,
mate, in a blaze of glory.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.960
It's the return of the general.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.800
<i>I think I'll be remembered as
one of the great leaders
of our generation.</i>

23:15.840 --> 23:18.280
I missed this place.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.960
Before me you had people
like Churchill,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.640
that bro with the little 'tache
that used to shout loads.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.520
You know, powerful leaders
that inspired the people.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.160
Back to take control
of my station.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.120
Boys!

23:33.160 --> 23:36.040
-Someone's outside!
-Who's that?

23:36.080 --> 23:38.320
-Deal with it, Steves!
-What do you mean?

23:38.360 --> 23:41.200
What? What's going on?

23:41.240 --> 23:43.800
-Come on, man.
-Just me?

23:43.840 --> 23:46.160
-You'll have to fight them.
-On my own?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.520
I'm the main one.
I need to be protected.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.600
It's my first shift,
I'm not ready for this.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.600
Stevie, listen, listen!
I've got you, don't worry.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.200
What the fuck?
I can hear you lot talking.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.920
Erm... What...
What's the password?

23:58.960 --> 24:03.080
Pass...? I don't know what...
There wasn't a password
when I was last here.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.560
-Is that Grindah?
-Does kind of
sound like Grindah.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.600
He could be doing an impression.

24:07.640 --> 24:10.560
-Is this a new thing?
-They've got him
tied up or something.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.680
Sorry, mate, could you say
the password, please, mate?

24:15.640 --> 24:19.480
I don't know. Kurupt FM?

24:19.520 --> 24:21.480
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

24:21.520 --> 24:22.840
Oh!

24:28.080 --> 24:29.960
Come here.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.880
Come here. Let it out.

24:32.920 --> 24:37.080
Throughout my whole life
I've always thought,
"What would Grindah do?"

24:37.120 --> 24:39.440
-Daddy's back, all right?
-Yeah.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.280
-Nothing can harm you now.
-So good to see you, man.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.280
Cos look what he's done for me.

24:45.240 --> 24:48.480
We're on Brentford's
biggest pirate radio station

24:48.520 --> 24:50.760
and I'm 31 years old.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.920
I've accomplished a lot.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.360
Welcome home, mate.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.560
Please, Steve, mate, I ain't
staying at this shit hole.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.520
-I'm only back for radio.
-Fair enough.

25:01.560 --> 25:06.320
I'm here to show everyone
that Kurupt FM is not
to be fucked with,

25:06.360 --> 25:09.360
cos we're the biggest,
baddest, rough-neckest

25:09.400 --> 25:11.480
radio station in
the land, like.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.480
-Trust me, trust me.
-Best believe!

25:13.520 --> 25:15.720
-[Robyn bawls]
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.200
She's banned from the station
for a start, yeah?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.760
-No chicks at radio.
-Fair enough.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.520
Yeah, and hurry up,
we've got things to do.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.280
[Angel] Time to jump! Pow!

25:25.320 --> 25:27.880
There's Nazis everywhere.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.520
Yaaa!

25:29.560 --> 25:31.800
Yeah. Angel?

25:31.840 --> 25:35.360
Angel, why don't you go and
kill the Nazis in your bedroom?

25:35.400 --> 25:38.200
-Yes, Mum!
-Yeah, good girl.

25:38.240 --> 25:41.560
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

25:51.200 --> 25:54.120
-You could have helped.
-Sorry, man.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.080
Why do you bring a baby
along to everything?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.680
<i>The most damaging thing you
can do to a pirate station</i>

25:59.720 --> 26:01.600
<i>-is take down their aerial.
-Yeah.</i>

26:01.640 --> 26:05.360
-Come on.
-I might have to catch you up.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.640
But we did something even
more clever. We took down
our own aerial.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.840
Exactly. My little idea,
actually.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.560
-Yeah.
-This way they'll never find it.

26:13.600 --> 26:18.160
-Oh, yeah, yeah! Kold FM, yeah?
-Yeah, trust me.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.440
If you lot are listening, yeah,

26:20.480 --> 26:23.320
I'd love to see you try and take
down our aerial now, mate, yeah?

26:23.360 --> 26:26.000
Exactly, yeah.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.840
<i>No pirate in their right mind
would ever keep their aerial
at their station.</i>

26:27.880 --> 26:31.560
It's a double bluff.
It's so stupid that, like...

26:31.600 --> 26:33.760
"Ah, surely they wouldn't
do that, would they?"

26:33.800 --> 26:35.840
-Yeah.
-It's unthinkable.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.560
-Idiots.
-Fucking dickheads.

-Come here.
-It's like, you know when
you need a shit on the bus,

27:10.800 --> 27:14.240
but there's nowhere you can go,
and it's getting more painful?

27:14.280 --> 27:17.760
And then you think, "Fuck, I'm
going to actually shit myself."

27:17.800 --> 27:22.040
Grindah's like the McDonald's in
the horizon. It's coming closer.
