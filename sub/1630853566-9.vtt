08:30.379 --> 08:31.380
CREAMCHEESE: That's what

08:31.423 --> 08:32.773
I'm fucking talking about.

08:32.816 --> 08:33.904
-Way to go, Nightfall.
-FORESITE: Nice.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.253
We weren't the underdogs
for long.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.385
-Nexus. Nexus.
-JATT: Fugitive will

08:36.428 --> 08:37.517
take the Nexus for

08:37.560 --> 08:38.909
a crucial lead in the series.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.389
-So fucking good.
-Yes, guys. Good stuff.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.782
That's it.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.305
CREAMCHEESE:
The first game gave us

08:43.348 --> 08:44.828
all the confidence we need,
so we went out there

08:44.872 --> 08:45.916
and we ran it back.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.135
Go, go, go. Keep throwing it.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.006
-Get to the Nexus.
-Yes, yes.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.617
-Fucking nice.
-FORESITE: Nice. Nice!

08:50.660 --> 08:52.140
PHREAK:
A 2-0 lead for Fugitive.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.185
This is what dreams
are made of right here.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.840
-Fuck yeah.
-Wow, there you go. Way to go.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.668
This may be
one of the most dominant,

08:58.712 --> 08:59.974
well played finals we've seen.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.671
We were just one game away

09:01.715 --> 09:03.543
from winning the title.

09:03.586 --> 09:04.848
You know, the-the glory.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.589
CREAMCHEESE:
After winning game two,

09:06.633 --> 09:08.678
we-we weren't even thinking
about winning game three.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.810
We were already

09:09.853 --> 09:11.725
thinking about winning Worlds.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.684
APRIL: Game three,
and they're playing well.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.339
-Ooh! So good.
-FORESITE: Nice, dude.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.688
Nice, bro.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
APRIL:
Up in kills, cold advantage.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.604
Smart choices throughout.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.345
Partway through that game three,

09:23.388 --> 09:25.695
Fugitive was looking like

09:25.739 --> 09:28.002
the best LCS team ever.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.656
All right. This is great.
Good, good, good.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.048
CREAMCHEESE:
So, the game is basically over.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.094
TSM is walking in
completely blind.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.704
Their Kog'Maw
doesn't have flash,

09:34.748 --> 09:36.619
so the only way he lives
is if I fuck it up.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.403
Okay, Cream,

09:38.447 --> 09:40.101
-whenever you're ready, buddy.
-CREAMCHEESE: All I had to do

09:40.144 --> 09:43.104
was land that
headbutt-pulverize on Kog'Maw.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.975
PHREAK:
Look at Creamcheese at the wall.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.629
-They don't see him.
-JATT: Ooh, this could be it.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
CREAMCHEESE: And it would've
been the perfect setup

09:48.326 --> 09:50.241
to one of the world's
sickest wombo combos.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.721
This is good.
This is good right here.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.201
This is great.
No, no, no, it's good.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.724
-All right, Cream, we got you.
-On you, Cream.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.247
-Cream.
-FORESITE: Go, go, go, go, go.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.772
Go, go, go, damage.
That's... Go, go.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.296
Oh, my fucking God.

10:01.339 --> 10:05.039
Cream sees his moment, he goes
in, completely fucks it.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.171
Punts the Kog'Maw to safety

10:07.215 --> 10:08.695
and everything collapsed
around him.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.870
Everyone blows their cooldowns,

10:09.913 --> 10:12.568
they hit nothing.
It's a disaster.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.135
PHREAK:
Oh, my God, Creamcheese

10:14.178 --> 10:16.137
botches the Alistar combo
and Projekt's

10:16.180 --> 10:18.835
able to free fire
onto Fugitive.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.663
He just doesn't press
the second letter

10:20.707 --> 10:22.665
on his keyboard.
Like, this isn't hard.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.928
Virtually anyone
can press W then Q,

10:24.972 --> 10:26.887
like, half-second later,
and-and the Kog'Maw's dead.

10:26.930 --> 10:28.540
What the fuck?
No, I hit my Q there.

10:28.584 --> 10:29.803
-FORESITE: Shut up, shut up.
-Back, back, back, back,

10:29.846 --> 10:31.369
-back, back.
-JATT: That has

10:31.413 --> 10:34.721
got to be one of
the most costly, messed-up

10:34.764 --> 10:36.331
headbutt-pulverize
I've ever seen.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.899
Completely failing
the wombo combo.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.552
PHREAK:
That is a brutal, unforgivable

10:40.596 --> 10:42.337
mistake by Creamcheese.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.475
CREAMCHEESE:
Unforgivable.

10:50.519 --> 10:51.999
That's what they called it.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.002
And they were right.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.786
PHREAK:
It is possible to screw up--

10:56.830 --> 10:58.832
we're humans-- but you can't,

10:58.875 --> 11:00.529
not in the finals,

11:00.572 --> 11:01.878
not when the pressure's on.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.053
You're not allowed
to make this mistake.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.534
Everyone remembers Cream's

11:05.577 --> 11:07.405
botched wombo combo,

11:07.449 --> 11:09.190
so it's easy to forget

11:09.233 --> 11:11.758
that we still
had two more games.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.020
You know?
Two more opportunities

11:13.063 --> 11:14.717
to win that series.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.719
Bro, what the fuck, Brax, why
didn't you go in on the gank?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.242
You should've TP'd.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.854
APRIL: But after that
missed wombo combo,

11:20.897 --> 11:23.334
it was clear that
Cream's mental was broken.

11:23.378 --> 11:26.076
Where is my fucking team?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.730
-APRIL: He was tilted.
-Fuck!

11:27.774 --> 11:29.514
PHREAK:
Creamcheese dies again.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.516
And there was no way
we were beating TSM.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.257
PHREAK: And listen
to that crowd. They're loving

11:33.301 --> 11:34.911
-the reverse sweep.
-CROWD: TSM! TSM! TSM!

11:34.955 --> 11:36.347
TSM take the Nexus.

11:36.391 --> 11:39.873
TSM take their fourth
championship.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.747
FORESITE:
I do feel bad for the guy.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.314
But at the time,

11:46.357 --> 11:48.577
we were just so

11:48.620 --> 11:50.797
angry at him.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.843
JATT: Yeah, you love to see
a finals go to all five games,

11:53.887 --> 11:56.280
and sometimes for the victor,

11:56.324 --> 11:58.195
the reverse sweep can be
all the more satisfying, right?

11:58.239 --> 12:00.850
Because they're
down in the gutter 0-2,

12:00.894 --> 12:02.852
but they managed to just
pull themselves back up.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.288
-Yeah.
-Especially games

12:04.332 --> 12:07.770
four and five.
Super dominant by TSM.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.294
CREAMCHEESE: I've gone over
that botched wombo combo

12:10.338 --> 12:13.210
maybe a million times
in my head.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
I honestly still
don't know what happened.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.955
99 times out of 100, I hit that.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.262
I think when
the general public thinks

12:21.305 --> 12:23.917
of professional gamers,
they think...

12:25.135 --> 12:28.312
...you know, of-of, like,
these Greek gods--

12:28.356 --> 12:31.751
they're machines,
they're the best of us.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.230
they're amazing.

12:33.274 --> 12:37.278
But it's easy to forget that...

12:38.801 --> 12:40.063
...they're human.

12:40.107 --> 12:43.153
Creamcheese decides
to give a speech

12:43.197 --> 12:46.287
after losing a championship.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.159
I have something
I want to say to everyone.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.248
It's like,
"How could I make this worse?

12:51.292 --> 12:53.903
"Oh, let me give a speech
that literally

12:53.947 --> 12:55.470
no one asked for."

12:55.513 --> 12:57.951
I've been hearing a lot
of people saying they don't

12:57.994 --> 12:59.909
think Fugitive Gaming
has what it takes to win.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.955
I've been hearing
a lot of people

13:01.998 --> 13:04.131
doubting us.
I heard

13:04.174 --> 13:07.438
people doubting us
even as we came on stage today.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.701
It was tough to watch.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.529
Trevor is like a brother to me,

13:11.573 --> 13:14.837
and I just remember seeing him
up on that stage thinking,

13:14.881 --> 13:16.534
"Who is this guy?"

13:17.579 --> 13:19.320
You know? I mean, this...
this isn't Trevor.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.887
CREAMCHEESE:
So, go ahead--

13:20.930 --> 13:22.714
keep on doubting,
'cause we're not gonna

13:22.758 --> 13:24.368
win just one championship.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.067
We're not gonna win
just two championships.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.809
We-we could, we could...

13:29.852 --> 13:31.245
Honestly, we'll...

13:31.288 --> 13:33.203
honestly, we'll probably
win seven championships.

13:33.247 --> 13:35.945
GURU: Motherfucker, you just

13:35.989 --> 13:39.383
lost! You just lost,
and you're gonna promise?

13:39.427 --> 13:40.820
How about one win?
How about one win

13:40.863 --> 13:42.822
before you promise seven?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.475
Frankly, I'm-I'm probably
the best support

13:44.519 --> 13:47.174
to ever play the game, and
that just hasn't shown up yet,

13:47.217 --> 13:48.479
and it will show up,
and when it does, we will

13:48.523 --> 13:50.264
win our championships,
we will win,

13:50.307 --> 13:52.048
probably, seven championships.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.571
KYLE:
I don't think people realize

13:53.615 --> 13:54.834
how much that series

13:54.877 --> 13:56.792
changed him.
I mean, before that,

13:56.836 --> 13:59.142
he wasn't this loud support

13:59.186 --> 14:00.665
with the huge ego.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.232
This is so fucking dumb.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.147
PHREAK: Creamcheese
is walking off the stage!

14:04.191 --> 14:05.540
The game's not even over yet!

14:05.583 --> 14:07.411
He was a sweet kid.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.500
MORGAN: And we have
Nutmilk on the floor.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.763
-What's up?
-KYLE: He was a good teammate.

14:11.807 --> 14:12.939
CREAMCHEESE:
I'm gonna call it right here--

14:12.982 --> 14:15.028
best jungler in NA.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.030
KYLE:
He was happy to be support.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.553
He would tell you himself

14:18.596 --> 14:20.511
that Foresite was the leader
of the team.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.731
CREAMCHEESE: Oh, my God!

14:22.774 --> 14:24.080
You're a fucking God.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.386
KYLE: And I think

14:25.429 --> 14:28.171
Cream believes
that all that changed

14:28.215 --> 14:30.173
when he missed the wombo combo.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.740
So, don't forget about me.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.482
Do not forget about me,
'cause I'll be back.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.310
But, for me...

14:37.398 --> 14:40.183
...it all changed
when he picked up that mic.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.404
Thank you for your time.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.712
APRIL:
A lot of fans

14:47.756 --> 14:49.018
blamed the loss on Creamcheese

14:49.062 --> 14:51.368
going to see Britney
the night before.

14:51.412 --> 14:54.850
And it didn't help
that Foresite doubled down.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.156
FORESITE: You know, we just

14:56.199 --> 14:57.548
need to learn from this
as a team

14:57.592 --> 15:00.943
because, frankly,
we were not as focused

15:00.987 --> 15:02.466
as we should've been.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.207
We should have been scrimming

15:04.251 --> 15:06.557
and not seeing concerts.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.603
APRIL:
Foresite knew

15:08.646 --> 15:10.648
how much Trevor loved him

15:10.692 --> 15:12.041
and looked up to him,

15:12.085 --> 15:13.956
but instead of defending Cream,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.479
he threw him under the bus.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.394
And the not-so-subtle
implication

15:17.438 --> 15:19.092
was that we would've beaten TSM

15:19.135 --> 15:21.703
if it weren't for
his relationship with Morgan.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.401
It's his first hike.
You're doing great. He loves it.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.751
Beautiful nature--
look at all these dead trees.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.406
CREAMCHEESE: After that loss
to TSM, all I'm doing

15:29.450 --> 15:31.278
is thinking about
that wombo combo,

15:31.321 --> 15:33.889
just playing it
over and over again,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.891
using that as my fuel,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.762
as my motivation.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.940
And Morgan thinks
I need to get my mind off of it,

15:40.983 --> 15:42.593
so she buys us
tickets to Paris.

15:42.637 --> 15:45.074
Trevor said that
he needed to work harder

15:45.118 --> 15:46.728
and not take a break,

15:46.771 --> 15:49.426
-so he refused to go.
-CREAMCHEESE: And that just

15:49.470 --> 15:51.515
became this whole big fight.

15:51.559 --> 15:55.128
He said he didn't have time
to talk about it or us

15:55.171 --> 15:57.130
or deal with me.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.392
CREAMCHEESE:
I had to

15:58.435 --> 16:00.742
work harder than everyone else

16:00.785 --> 16:02.004
to be the best.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.137
This is something
where he's-he's

16:04.180 --> 16:06.661
playing, like,
all hours of every day.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.838
I couldn't have any more
distractions, you know?

16:09.881 --> 16:12.972
So, I-I just locked myself
in the scrim room.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.975
It just felt like this
was obviously the direction

16:16.018 --> 16:17.933
that Trevor's life was going in.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.326
The esports world

16:19.369 --> 16:21.676
is where you all
sort of live together.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.853
The team lives together,
congregated in a single house.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.376
I have been through that life.

16:26.420 --> 16:27.856
It is not for everyone.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.814
MORGAN: It became clear
that Trevor's life

16:29.858 --> 16:34.167
was now justLeague
and onlyLeague.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.040
And I didn't see
where I really fit

16:38.084 --> 16:40.695
into it in a long-term way.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.829
KYLE: The breakup with Morgan
really hurt him. Uh,

16:44.873 --> 16:47.615
still does, I think, but...

16:48.920 --> 16:51.097
Foresite leaving...

16:51.140 --> 16:53.621
Even now,
he won't talk about it.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.450
I think it's too painful.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.756
APRIL:
Well, the news broke

16:58.800 --> 17:00.584
a little after MSI.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.847
Foresite was
going to play for TSM.

17:02.891 --> 17:06.590
PHREAK: Foresite confirmed today
a two-year deal with TSM.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.462
JATT: If TSM wasn't
already the favorite

17:08.505 --> 17:10.507
to win it all again,
they are now definitely...

17:10.551 --> 17:12.683
CREAMCHEESE:
I felt like I fucked it up.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.164
He really wanted to win
a championship, and, like,

17:15.208 --> 17:17.384
I was out there with Morgan

17:17.427 --> 17:20.039
seeing concerts and-and

17:20.082 --> 17:22.258
blowing 2-0 leads, so...

17:22.302 --> 17:23.825
I don't blame him.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.871
When Foresite left,
everything changed.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.787
I think he wanted to prove
that he could win

17:29.831 --> 17:31.180
without Foresite, but

17:31.224 --> 17:33.008
we all know
how history played out.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.402
Foresite is known
for all the incredible things

17:35.445 --> 17:37.404
that he's accomplished.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.970
And Creamcheese is mostly

17:39.014 --> 17:40.407
known for the things he hasn't.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.278
Oh, my fucking God.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.888
It was tough for all of us.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.499
I mean, to watch Foresite win

17:45.542 --> 17:48.023
title after title without us.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.895
The more success Foresite had,

17:50.939 --> 17:53.420
the more pressure
Cream put on himself.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.162
ANNOUNCER: Rise available,
misses the knockup.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.859
-And the black shield's
-Fuck.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.513
on his back to safety.
There's not enough damage...

17:59.556 --> 18:01.384
Any time a new ADC came in,

18:01.428 --> 18:04.300
Cream would make sure
they knew, "This is my team.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.649
I am theFugitive."

18:05.693 --> 18:07.129
CREAMCHEESE:
Like, why do you

18:07.173 --> 18:09.131
think it's called Fugitive?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.829
-Because I am the Fugitive.
-Right.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.093
I've been building his team
since I was Nutmilk, dude.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.226
He wanted so badly to change
the narrative about himself,

18:17.270 --> 18:20.229
but that's not
how things played out.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.929
JATT:
That's a disaster for Fugitive.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.801
ANNOUNCER: Creamcheese just does
not deliver when it matters.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.673
When we lost to Godless in 2017,
fans talked about Britney.

18:29.717 --> 18:32.198
When we lost again in 2018,

18:32.241 --> 18:33.808
"Oops, Cream did it again."

18:33.851 --> 18:36.289
CREAMCHEESE: I couldn't tell
if I was actually

18:36.332 --> 18:39.030
a choker or if they convinced me

18:39.074 --> 18:40.423
that I was a choker.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.382
It's likeInception,

18:42.425 --> 18:46.212
but instead of a dream
it's, like, a-a bad dream.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.735
APRIL:
After that first season,

18:47.778 --> 18:50.259
it was a rough five years
for Cream,

18:50.303 --> 18:52.174
and it just broke my heart

18:52.218 --> 18:54.698
because I knew
he really blamed himself.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.831
Is it a mental thing? Does
he have the blocker that's gonna

18:56.874 --> 18:58.267
prevent him from ever winning
a championship?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.139
Yeah, he does.

an opportunity
to try this strategy.

on their bot lane all playoffs,

21:40.386 --> 21:41.430

the story of game one, Azael:

22:30.523 --> 22:33.221
the lane swap
from Fugitive Gaming

22:33.264 --> 22:36.006

We're in a good position here.

a near-perfect game

22:55.069 --> 22:58.768
and giving TSM a real advantage
early on in the bot lane.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.510
Another strong performance
from Organizm in game two

23:01.554 --> 23:03.425
of the series, but Fugitive
is still slipping behind

23:03.469 --> 23:05.209
in gold and kills.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.298
We need to find picks.
Urgot's too tanky and Samira's

23:07.342 --> 23:09.126
-too fed for a team fight.
-NIGHTFALL: Yeah, yeah,

23:09.170 --> 23:11.302
I can shadow Tyrant, and
then maybe we can get a bounty.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.479

little bit of a bait coming out

23:13.522 --> 23:14.958
as they engage here,
bringing up

23:15.002 --> 23:16.569
the extra man.
-AZAEL: He's gonna get the kill.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.005
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
Nightfall shows up,

23:18.048 --> 23:20.660
but it will be
a one-for-one trade,

23:20.703 --> 23:22.836
losing their top laner,
but it's still Nightfall

23:22.879 --> 23:25.708
ready to go
and keep this push alive.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.318
AZAEL: Nightfall gets the kill
and the bounty,

23:27.362 --> 23:28.711
but it could be too late,
TSM are on the push.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.321

can pull this off
