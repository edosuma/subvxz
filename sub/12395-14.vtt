WEBVTT

00:08.800 --> 00:11.303
- DR. STRODE,
DOES THE NAME BOB WHITE

00:11.340 --> 00:13.035
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.138
- IS HE A CHILDREN'S CLOWN?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.499
- NO.
- ADULT'S-ONLY CLOWN?

00:15.540 --> 00:17.201
- NO, HE'S NOT
A CLOWN OF ANY SORT.

00:17.250 --> 00:20.048
YOU PERFORMED AN AUTOPSY
ON HIM TWO NIGHTS AGO.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.377
HE WAS HIT BY A BUS?

00:21.420 --> 00:23.581
- OH, OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY, YEAH.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.316
I-I OFTEN CONFUSE CLOWNS
AND BUS VICTIMS.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.384
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT WAS A--

00:27.420 --> 00:29.229
THAT WAS
A TRAGIC ACCIDENT.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.329
- OR WAS IT?

00:30.360 --> 00:32.453
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE
THAT IT WAS NOT

00:32.500 --> 00:33.751
AND THAT
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.463
- UH, NO, NO, CHIEF,
I-I DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.092
- SAYS THE GUY
WHO LEFI' HIS KEYS

00:39.140 --> 00:40.459
IN AN OLD LADY'S SPLEEN
LAST MONTH.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.468
- OH, PLEASE, DETECTIVE.
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER LOST KEYS?

00:42.510 --> 00:45.832
- DO YOU REMEMBER
A MISSING EARLOBE?

00:45.870 --> 00:47.633
WELL, THIS WOMAN DOES.

00:47.680 --> 00:51.377
SHE IS THE MORTICIAN WHO WAS IN
PROCESS OF EMBALMING MR. WHITE

00:51.410 --> 00:54.277
WHEN SHE DISCOVERED
THE INCONSISTENCY.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.380
- HELLO, WOODROW.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.183
- HELLO, GRACE.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.710
- YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

01:00.760 --> 01:03.479
- OH, DR. STRODE AND I WERE
IN FORENSICS SCHOOL TOGETHER.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.328
- WE WERE ALSO BRIEFLY...

01:06.360 --> 01:09.329
LOVERS.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.667
- EW.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.588
- THE EARLOBE WAS SLICED
PRIOR TO QUIETUS

01:12.640 --> 01:14.460
AND CERTAINLY NOT BY A TIRE.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.865
THE INCISION WAS CLEAN,
PRECISE,

01:15.900 --> 01:18.539
AS THOUGH MADE
BY A BOX CU'I'I'ER OR SOMETHING.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.231
THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.443
THE WOODY I KNOW WOULD NEVER
HAVE MISSED SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.844
- AH, NO.
THE BLOOD ALCOHOL WAS .31.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.653
HE PASSES OUT, FALLS.

01:32.690 --> 01:35.488
I MEAN, CHIEF, LOOK,
I MAY HAVE MISSED THIS DETAIL,

01:35.520 --> 01:37.488
BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW
THAT THIS WAS A MURDER.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.794
I MEAN, CLOWNS FALL.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.354
- I GOT TO TELL YOU, WOODY.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.265
I'M GETTING A LITTLE FED UP
WITH THIS SLOPPY WORK.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.597
- OKAY.

01:44.630 --> 01:46.860
IF THE WOODMAN SAYS IT'S
AN ACCIDENT, THEN SO DO WE.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.765
- I'M GOING TO NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.461
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
GUS AND I WILL HIT THE SCENE.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.501
AND DON'T WORRY--
IT'S GOING TO BE PRO BONO.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.474
WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL
HALEY JOEL OSMENT ON THIS--

01:54.510 --> 01:55.408
PAY IT FORWARD.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.305
- WHY CAN'T WE GO ALL
HALEY JOEL OSMENT

01:57.350 --> 01:58.578
AND GET PAID, LIKE HE DID
WITH COUNTRY BEARS?

01:58.610 --> 02:00.612
- H.J.O.
WAS IN COUNTRY BEARS?

02:00.650 --> 02:02.515
- HE PLAYED A BEAR
NAMED BEARY BARRINGTON.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.687
- MY GOD.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.688
IS THERE ANYTHING
THIS KID CAN'T DO?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.153
- WELL, HE'S NOT REALLY
A KID ANYMORE.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.350
HE'S IN HIS 20$,

02:08.390 --> 02:11.257
TECHNICALLY,
HE'S A YOUNG MAN.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.763
- SO THIS IS THE ADDRESS
OF THE REPORT.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.836
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO START?
YOU WANT TO WALK THE SCENE?

02:19.870 --> 02:21.360
- WELL, YOU ARE STANDING
RIGHT WHERE

02:21.400 --> 02:22.332
THE BUS RAN OVER
OVER BOB WHITE'S BODY.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.429
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LAY DOWN?
- I WILL NOT.

02:24.470 --> 02:25.459
- GUS, YOU'RE THE VICTIM.

02:25.510 --> 02:26.602
- WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE THE VICTIM?

02:26.640 --> 02:28.437
- BECAUSE TO CAST YOU AS
THE KILLER WOULDN'T BE VERY P.C.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.799
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU P.C.,
SHAWN?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.545
- DO YOU WANT TO BE
OUT HERE ALL NIGHT,

02:31.580 --> 02:32.569
OR DO YOU WANT TO GO GET
SOME FOOD?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.417
- FINE.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.458
- THIS SAYS THE STREETLAMP

02:44.490 --> 02:47.550
DIRECTLY OVER
THE BUS STOP WAS OUT.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.592
[electricity crackles,
glass shattering]

02:52.940 --> 02:54.931
GUS, YOU STILL THERE?

02:54.970 --> 02:56.460
- YOU SEE MY FACE
ON THIS ASPHALT, SHAWN.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.568
HURRY UP.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.534
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

03:04.510 --> 03:08.344
- SO THE LAMP WAS VANDALIZED--
PROBABLY TEENAGERS.

03:08.380 --> 03:10.541
STILL SAYS ACCIDENT.
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:10.590 --> 03:11.841
THEY DECIDE
TO BUST ONE LAMP,

03:11.890 --> 03:13.585
AND IT JUST HAPPENS
TO BE THE STREETLAMP

03:13.620 --> 03:15.554
THAT PREVENTS
THE BUS DRIVER FROM SEEING

03:15.590 --> 03:17.353
THE DRUNKEST GUY IN THE WORLD
LAYING IN THE STREET?

03:17.390 --> 03:19.221
- GENTLEMEN...

03:19.260 --> 03:22.366
MIGHT I ASK WHY THIS MAN
IN STRAIGHT-CUT DENIM

03:22.400 --> 03:23.424
IS LYING IN THE STREET

03:23.470 --> 03:26.234
WHILE YOU ARE MAKING BUS SOUNDS
IN THE MOONLIGHT?

03:26.270 --> 03:27.999
- IF YOU MUST KNOW,
WE ARE PANTOMIME ARTISTS

03:28.040 --> 03:30.565
FROM NEW GUINEA
DEVELOPING A NEW ROUTINE.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.738
LOOK, I AM TRAPPED
IN THIS BOX ON CASTORS.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.568
LUCKILY, THIS BOX
ALSO HAS AN ELEVATOR.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.840
GOOD-BYE.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.916
- NO.
- WE ARE DETECT IVES.

03:41.950 --> 03:43.679
AND WE'RE INVESTIGATING
A POSSIBLE MURDER

03:43.720 --> 03:45.585
THAT HAPPENED HERE
TWO NIGHTS AGO AT 1:00 AM.

03:45.620 --> 03:47.679
- REALLY?
RIGHT HERE ON THE STREET?

03:47.720 --> 03:48.914
UNBELIEVABLE.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.985
I MEAN, THE ONE NIGHT
THAT THERE'S A MURDER,

03:51.030 --> 03:51.951
AND I WAS SLEEPING.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.959
I NEVER SLEEP.
DAMN YOU, CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.763
- YOU COULDN'T JUST GO
WITH THE PANTOMIME THING?

03:56.800 --> 03:59.564
- GENTLEMEN, MY NAME
IS WHIP CHA'I'TERLY.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.036
AND I CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.664
- WELL, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, WHIP...

04:05.710 --> 04:07.029
CREAM, WAS IT?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.901
I HAPPEN TO BE
THE HEAD PSYCHIC DETECTIVE

04:09.950 --> 04:11.975
FOR THE S.B.P.D.,
AND MY PARTNER HERE IS BLACK.

04:12.010 --> 04:13.716
SO I BELIEVE
OUR BASES ARE COVERED.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.047
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

04:15.080 --> 04:18.345
- OH, MY.
OH, YOU'RE SHAWN SPENCER.

04:18.390 --> 04:20.756
OH, OH, HI.

04:20.790 --> 04:23.054
OH, YOU GUYS
ARE LIKE CELEBRITIES TO ME.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.626
- [chuckles]

04:24.660 --> 04:25.820
- THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.852
UH, ACTUALLY WE DON'T HAVE
ANY HEAD SHOTS ON US RIGHT NOW,

04:28.900 --> 04:30.822
BUT, UH...
AH, TO HECK WITH IT.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.019
WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE GUS A BIG HUG?

04:32.070 --> 04:33.799
- I WOULD LOVE TO.
- HOW ABOUT YOU DON'T?

04:33.840 --> 04:34.864
- ALL RIGHT.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.437
LISTEN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER
YOU UP MY PROWESS.

04:37.470 --> 04:40.803
YOU SEE, I AM A--
BIT OF A MURDER EXPERT.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.979
- WHAT?
DID YOU KILL SOMEONE?

04:43.010 --> 04:45.808
- NO.

04:45.850 --> 04:49.013
BUT THE NEXT BEST THING...

04:49.050 --> 04:50.449
THIS...

04:50.490 --> 04:54.608
IS MY ESTABLISHMENT.

04:57.630 --> 05:01.657
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

05:01.700 --> 05:02.826
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:02.870 --> 05:05.020
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

05:05.070 --> 05:06.435
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:06.470 --> 05:08.461
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

05:08.500 --> 05:10.866
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION,
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

05:10.910 --> 05:12.400
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

05:12.440 --> 05:15.773
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU
OUT AT THE END *

05:15.810 --> 05:18.540
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:19.650 --> 05:22.687
- SO, WE HAVE A DRUNKEN MAN
RUN OVER BY A LARGE VEHICLE

05:22.720 --> 05:24.779
AFTER HE WAS ALREADY MURDERED.

05:24.820 --> 05:28.586
THIS REMINDS ME OF A CASE
FROM 1983 THAT I READ ABOUT.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.848
- WOW, THAT'S SOUNDS COOL.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.824
DUDE, WE ALREADY HUNG OUT

05:31.860 --> 05:33.589
WITH ENOUGH CRAZY
WHITE PEOPLE THIS YEAR.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.598
- IN THIS CASE,
AN ILLINOIS FARMER

05:35.630 --> 05:38.758
HAD SEEMINGLY BEEN RUN OVER
BY HIS OWN TRACTOR,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.963
BUT IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED
THAT THE GEAR PEDALS

05:42.000 --> 05:43.865
HAD BEEN ADJUSTED
FOR A TINY PERSON.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.401
TURNS OUT HE WAS KILLED
WITH CYANIDE

05:46.440 --> 05:48.601
BY A DWARF BEFORE HE EVER EVEN
GOT ON THAT TRACTOR.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.642
THEY NEVER CAUGHT
THAT LITTLE FELLOW.

05:50.680 --> 05:55.708
- YOU'RE SAYING THE DWARF
IS STILL AT LARGE?

05:55.750 --> 05:58.548
- WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
IS THAT MURDER

05:58.590 --> 05:59.852
IS ALWAYS
A MACABRE BUSINESS.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.915
BUT ONE MAKES IT
LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT--

06:01.960 --> 06:03.882
WELL, THAT TAKES SKILL,

06:03.930 --> 06:05.886
KNOWLEDGE,
THE MOST INTRICATE PLANNING.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.898
PLEASE TURN AROUND.
- WHAT?

06:07.930 --> 06:10.728
- RUMPS FACING ME.
LET ME SEE YOUR RUMPS.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.432
- [sighs]

06:17.810 --> 06:18.663
- WHAT'S THAT FOR?

06:18.710 --> 06:20.803
- I JUST GOT IT--
THE "AT LARGE" JOKE.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.673
- AH.
- HILARIOUS.

06:23.710 --> 06:26.042
- COME, COME.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.044
- OH, NICE.
YOU HAVE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.911
- HERE'S THE OUTSIDE CAMERA.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.019
- WELL, IF SOMEONE DECIDES
TO COMMIT A MURDER

06:35.060 --> 06:37.085
INSIDE OF THAT THREE-FOOT
RADIUS, WE ARE COVERED.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.052
- OKAY, CONFESSION. ..

06:39.090 --> 06:42.127
I JUST WANTED TO GET
YOU GUYS IN HERE.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.696
- WHY--TO KILL US?

06:43.730 --> 06:45.061
- LOOK, WHIP,

06:45.100 --> 06:47.864
YOU'RE RAMBUNCTIOUS AND ODD
AND TURTLENECK-Y.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.834
WE ALWAYS DO ENJOY
MEETING A TRUE FAN,

06:49.870 --> 06:52.577
BUT IT'S TIME FOR GUS AND I
TO RUN OFF INTO THE NIGHT NOW.

06:52.610 --> 06:53.907
- GOOD NIGHT.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.443
- NO, NO, NO,
W-WAIT, WAIT.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.142
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

06:59.180 --> 07:00.340
WOULD YOU AT LEAST

07:00.380 --> 07:03.918
BESTOW UPON ME THE HONOR
OF SIGNING MY YANG BOOK?

07:03.950 --> 07:05.781
both: AH.

07:05.820 --> 07:06.855
- AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT

07:06.890 --> 07:08.687
THAT MARY LIGHTLY
WAS THE KILLER?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.756
- WOW. YOU REALLY READ
THIS CLOSELY.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.724
- OH, I'VE READ IT
100 TIMES.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.796
IN FACT, I HAVE READ EVERY BOOK
PUBLISHED ON MURDER SINCE 1850,

07:14.830 --> 07:16.058
TO BE PRECISE.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.091
- WHY ARE YOU SO FASCINATED
WITH MURDER?

07:18.130 --> 07:19.461
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.967
WITH ONE TERRIBLE ACT,
SOMEONE CAN BECOME

07:21.000 --> 07:22.558
IMMORTALIZED FOREVER.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.032
I JUST FIND IT FASCINATING.

07:24.070 --> 07:26.038
PRECEDENT TELLS US
THAT THE VICTIM'S INNARDS

07:26.070 --> 07:27.970
WILL TELL THE STORY
OF HIS DEATH.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.205
ITS CONTENTS ARE LIKE
A CLOCKWORK BACKWARDS

07:30.250 --> 07:32.206
FROM THE TIME OF DEATH,
BUT YOU MUST HURRY.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.718
- WE KNOW THE DRILL, WHIP.
UH, WE'VE--

07:34.750 --> 07:36.217
WE'VE SEEN THE FIRST 48.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.115
- AND SO HAVE I,
EVERY EPISODE.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.152
- OKAY.
WELL, WATCHING IT ON TV

07:40.190 --> 07:41.919
AND EVEN--EVEN READING
ABOUT IT IN BOOKS

07:41.960 --> 07:44.724
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THAN THE REAL THING.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.752
- GENTLEMEN, ALLOW ME TO BE
YOUR SECRET WEAPON.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.769
WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT TO LOSE, HUH?

07:50.800 --> 07:53.894
I WILL ALSO COVER
THE COST OF ALL SNACKS.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.089
- WHAT KIND OF SNACKS?

07:55.140 --> 07:59.167
KEEPING IN MIND THAT FRUIT
AND DRIED FRUIT ARE NOT SNACKS.

07:59.210 --> 08:00.677
- FOOD FOR THOUGHT.

08:00.710 --> 08:03.702
LET'S BRING IT IN.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.876
NO?

08:04.910 --> 08:06.639
- MR. SPENCER
HAS CONCLUDED AS WELL

08:06.680 --> 08:08.545
THAT BOB WHITE
MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.945
- I'M SORRY, WOODY.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.981
- THIS MISCUE HAS COST US
THE 40 HOURS OF LEAD TIME

08:12.020 --> 08:13.112
IN SOLVING THIS CASE.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.287
- I AM WILLING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO SOLVE THIS.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.585
I WILL STAY HERE UNTIL 6:15 P.M.
IF NEED BE.

08:18.630 --> 08:20.052
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

08:20.100 --> 08:23.126
I WILL RECHECK
FOR SIGNS OF HEAD TRAUMA.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.899
- UH, SINCE TIME
IS OF THE ESSENCE,

08:24.930 --> 08:26.989
WOULDN'T IT BE WISE TO START
WITH THE STOMACH?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.600
IT WOULD GIVE US AN INDICATION
OF WHERE THE VICTIM HAS EATEN

08:29.640 --> 08:30.459
IN THE LAST 18 HOURS.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.673
- BY THE WAY,
I AM SENSING THAT, UH...

08:33.710 --> 08:36.838
THE STOMACH IS PROBABLY
THE RIGHT PLACE TO START.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.677
- ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, CHIEF, I, UH...

08:38.710 --> 08:42.077
I ADMIT, I AM--I AM THROWN
BY THE IDEA THAT MY MISTAKE

08:42.120 --> 08:44.281
MAY HAVE SET US
BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL HERE.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.982
BUT IF THERE IS
A MURDER TO BE SOLVED,

08:47.020 --> 08:50.558
NO ONE IS BETTER THAN ME--
NO ONE.

08:50.590 --> 08:52.990
WELL, MAYBE GARY SINISE.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.089
MAYBE SINISE.
- MS. LARSON...

08:55.130 --> 08:57.018
ARE YOU A LICENSED EXAMINER
IN THIS STATE?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.992
- WELL, I KEEP
MY CREDENTIALS UP, BUT--

08:59.030 --> 09:01.032
- I'M EXERCISING
MY DISCRETION IN THE COUNTY

09:01.070 --> 09:03.937
TO HIRE YOU ON
TO CONSULT ON THIS CASE.

09:03.970 --> 09:05.039
- [scoffs]

09:05.070 --> 09:09.200
[laughing] WELL, THAT IS JUST
INSANELY RIDICULOUS.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.741
RIM SHOT?

09:10.780 --> 09:12.202
- OKAY, LOOK,
DR. STRODE IS--IS RIGHT.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.877
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HIS CASE
WHEN I CALLED,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.013
AND I DON'T WANT TO STEP
ON ANYONE'S TOES HERE.

09:16.050 --> 09:17.586
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
THE CASE IS SENSITIVE.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.954
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.981
A MORTICIAN'S NOTHING MORE
THAN A GLORIFIED MAKEUP ARTIST.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.986
- WELL, A MAKEUP ARTIST
WHO KNEW TO START

09:25.030 --> 09:26.258
WITH THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.757
- YOU LOOKED BETTER
WITH LONG HAIR.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.621
- YOU LOOK LIKE
A GREAT, BIG GERBER BABY.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.069
- YOU MOVE YOUR LIPS
WHEN YOU READ.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.795
- IS THAT A BALD CAP
ON YOUR HEAD,

09:33.840 --> 09:34.932
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:34.970 --> 09:35.789
IT REMINDS ME OF ONE
THAT I SAW

09:35.840 --> 09:37.705
IN A REALLY BAD
HIGH-SCHOOL PRODUCTION

09:37.740 --> 09:40.334
OF THE KING AND I,
WHICH I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.972
- BY THE WAY, I LIED.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.705
MY FATHER WAS NEVER
KING OF SWEDEN.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.047
- HA HA HA!

09:45.080 --> 09:46.843
- [mumbling mockingly]
OKAY.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.074
- COME ON, JUST FIGHT!
GO, GO, GO, GO!

09:48.120 --> 09:49.269
- ENOUGH!

09:49.320 --> 09:51.083
OKAY, WOODY,
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU HERE,

09:51.120 --> 09:54.248
BECAUSE IF THIS CASE TURNS
INTO AN UNSOLVED MURDER--

09:54.290 --> 09:56.986
AND IT'S LOOKING MORE LIKELY
BY THE MINUTE THAT IT WILL BE--

09:57.030 --> 09:59.828
YOU MAY BE OUT OF A JOB.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.262
- THANK YOU.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.098
- OKAY, WOODY,
LET'S BE MATURE ABOUT THIS.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.234
LET'S NOT REHASH OLD TIMES
AND PLAY POWER GAMES.

10:08.270 --> 10:12.104
LET'S SLICE OPEN THIS MAN'S
STOMACH AND SOLVE A MURDER.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.305
- WHAT ARE THESE--
WAFFLE CHUNKS?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.647
- SERIOUSLY,

10:18.680 --> 10:20.716
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO BE HERE
FOR THIS?

10:20.750 --> 10:24.117
- THERE'S LEMONGRASS
AND BEAN PASTE,

10:24.150 --> 10:25.913
BUT I ALSO SEE...

10:25.950 --> 10:27.952
THESE GREENS...

10:27.990 --> 10:29.014
- COLLARD, MAYBE?

10:29.060 --> 10:33.793
- AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE POTATO
AND SUGAR CONTENT.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.695
- SWEET-POTATO PIE?

10:35.730 --> 10:37.766
- WHERE WOULD SOMEONE
HAVE GONE

10:37.800 --> 10:40.030
TO HAVE EATEN
BOTH SOUL FOOD AND THAI?

10:40.070 --> 10:43.198
- AFRO-THAI.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.265
both:
PHAT THAI JONES.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.839
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED WHIP.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.677
- WELL, BELIEVE IT, GUS,
BECAUSE HERE HE IS.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.041
HIS VAST KNOWLEDGE
OF MURDER AND TRUE CRIME

10:56.080 --> 10:58.310
MAY JUST COME IN HANDY.
- UNTIL HE KILLS US.

10:58.350 --> 11:01.183
- THIS IS INVIGORATING.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.256
I FEEL TINGLY.
- MM-HMM.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.451
- I MEAN,
IT MIGHT JUST BE MY SHAMPOO.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.151
YOU KNOW,
IT'S GOT TEA TREE OIL IN IT.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.327
NOW, HOW DO THESE
PSYCHIC INQUISITIONS WORK?

11:09.360 --> 11:11.362
WILL WE BE TOUCHING
OUR SUBJECTS?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.288
- MAY I HELP YOU?
- YES.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.331
DID YOU SEE THIS MAN HERE
TWO NIGHTS AGO?

11:15.370 --> 11:16.860
- HEY, SINGH.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.435
[speaking Thai]

11:19.470 --> 11:21.938
COME ON.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.379
- OH, THIS GUY
MIGHT BE MORE HELPFUL.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.742
- [Thai accent]
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE PICTURE.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.476
- WHOA. WHOA!
TAKE IT DOWN, MAN.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.715
DON'T YOU THINK THAT ACCENT'S
A LITTLE OFFENSIVE?

11:30.750 --> 11:33.412
- MY ACCENT OFFENSIVE?
- YES.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.725
- YOUR ACCENT OFFENSIVE.
T-THIS IS HOW I TALK.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.284
I'M HIS SON.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.890
- OH, YOU'RE, UH--

11:40.930 --> 11:43.262
- ADOPTED, YES.
OKAY, BUD FROM COSBY?

11:43.300 --> 11:46.292
I GREW UP IN BANGKOK.
WE CAME HERE THREE YEARS AGO.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.959
STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF A TWANG.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.501
- YES, YES, UH,
BOB WHITE.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.428
YES, OF COURSE I KNOW HIM.
HE'S A REGULAR.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.301
HE WAS HERE TWO NIGHTS AGO.
HE SIT RIGHT OVER THERE.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.306
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME
HE WAS HERE?

11:59.350 --> 12:01.318
- 6:00.

12:01.350 --> 12:04.012
- GENTLEMEN, WE ARE STANDING
IN THE PRESENCE

12:04.050 --> 12:05.017
OF WHERE BOB WHITE WAS

12:05.050 --> 12:08.178
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HOURS
BEFORE HIS DEATH.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.890
- [sighs]

12:14.930 --> 12:17.467
WAS HE HERE WITH SOMEONE?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.990
- TABLE FOR ONE--
HE LONELY.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.463
HE HAVE NO HONEY.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.092
- WAS HE DRINKING A LOT?
- DRINKING?

12:22.140 --> 12:24.108
NO, NO,
HE ALLERGIC TO ALCOHOL.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.937
- ALLERGIC?
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT, SINGH?

12:25.970 --> 12:29.406
AUTOPSY REPORT SAID
HIS BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL WAS .31.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.772
- NO, I OFFER HIM PLUM WINE,
BUT HE SAY NO.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.971
I GIVE HIM
PLUM CAKE INSTEAD.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.419
- PLUM CAKE IS MADE
WITH ALCOHOL.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.509
- TEENY BIT, YES,
YOU KNOW.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.347
BUT HE INSIST, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE OUR PLUM CAKE--

12:39.390 --> 12:43.281
IT TASTES LIKE YOU HAVE PICKED
A PLUM STRAIGHT FROM A TREE,

12:43.330 --> 12:45.321
AND YOU STICK IT IN A CAKE.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.486
- HOLY--

12:46.530 --> 12:47.792
- REALLY?
- HMM.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.127
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.162
- YOU WANT PLUM CAKE?
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.998
- COULD YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.167
- CAN WE HAVE TWO PIECES
OF PLUM CAKE, PLEASE?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.861
- THREE.
- THREE.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.003
- HE WAS ALLERGIC TO ALCOHOL?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.508
BOY, I DIDN'T REALIZED PLUM CAKE
HAD THAT MUCH ALCOHOL IN IT.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.542
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS THE DILATION
OF THE BLOOD VESSELS.

13:04.580 --> 13:08.118
- WELL, EITHER WAY YOU DON'T GET
.31 SATURATION FROM PLUM CAKE.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.242
SOMEONE WITH SUCH AN ALLERGY

13:09.280 --> 13:11.487
WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO INGEST
THAT AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.011
IS IT AT ALL POSSIBLE
THE ALCOHOL

13:14.060 --> 13:17.052
COULD HAVE BEEN INSERTED
INTO THE BLOODSTREAM SOMEHOW?

13:17.090 --> 13:19.354
- TWO THINGS--

13:19.390 --> 13:20.596
THAT IS THE SEXIEST THING

13:20.630 --> 13:22.222
I HAVE EVER HEARD
IN THIS OFFICE.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.228
AND IT IS POSSIBLE,
WITH A SYRINGE.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.329
- WE WOULD START SCANNING
THE BODY FOR INJECTION MARKS,

13:26.370 --> 13:27.598
AND IT COULD TAKE A WHILE.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.200
- NO, HE'S PRETTY MUCH
SAME OLD BOB WHITE.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.401
YOU KNOW, HE LEFT
HALF A WARM COKE...

13:32.440 --> 13:34.829
OH, AND, UH, ALSO THIS.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.474
BUT, UH, I KEEP FOR MYSELF.

13:37.510 --> 13:40.570
- CARNIVAL TICKETS?
- THE SITE OF GRISLY MURDERS--

13:40.620 --> 13:44.989
CARN-EVIL BY STUART ROBSON,
MIDDLETON PRESS, 1971.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.250
GENTLEMEN, THESE ARE NOT
CARNIVAL TICKETS.

13:47.290 --> 13:49.087
BUT IT IS GOING TO BE
A HELL OF A RIDE.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.154
- THAT'S WEIRD.
ALL RIGHT, GOT IT.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.519
THAT WAS WOODY.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.199
GRACE FOUND AN INJECTION SITE
ON BOB'S LEFT FOOT.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.527
SO APPARENTLY THE ALCOHOL
WAS PUMPED DIRECTLY

13:59.570 --> 14:00.559
INTO HIS BLOODSTREAM.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.033
- OOH, WAS THE INJECTION SITE

14:02.070 --> 14:03.560
BETWEEN THE SECOND
AND THIRD TOE?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.534
- YEAH, IT WAS.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

14:06.570 --> 14:09.004
- OH, STRAIGHT
OUT OF LOST IN THE PARADE--

14:09.040 --> 14:11.577
TYNE HANNERMAN,
SOJI PRESS, 1931.

14:11.610 --> 14:15.239
THE POINT IS,
SOMEBODY HANDPICKED THIS GUY.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.612
IT WAS CONTROLLED,
CALCULATED...

14:17.650 --> 14:21.450
COLD-BLOODED.

14:21.490 --> 14:23.321
GET THOSE TICKETS OUT, BOYS.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.885
WE'VE ARRIVED
AT BOB'S NEXT DESTINATION.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.899
[slow jazz]

14:28.930 --> 14:36.939
*

14:42.710 --> 14:44.177
- WHERE THE...

14:44.210 --> 14:46.269
HELL ARE WE?

14:46.310 --> 14:49.609
- WHEN THE HELL ARE WE?

14:54.620 --> 14:58.488
- GENTLEMEN, WE ARE STANDING
IN A RETRO DIME-A-DANCE HALL--

14:58.530 --> 15:00.327
ONE OF THE LAST OF ITS KIND.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.625
HERE, REGULAR FELLOWS CAN DRESS
UP LIKE SERVICEMEN

15:03.670 --> 15:05.626
ON LEAVE FROM THE 19305

15:05.670 --> 15:08.662
AND OFFER UP A COUPON
TO TRIP THE LIGHT FANTASTIC

15:08.700 --> 15:11.703
WITH ONE OF THESE ALLURING
AND VOLUPTUOUS WOMEN.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.504
- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS PLACE?

15:14.540 --> 15:17.008
- BECAUSE I AM
A LONELY INDIVIDUAL...

15:17.050 --> 15:18.642
AND SO WAS BOB WHITE.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.840
OH, LOOK AT THIS.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.418
ANY ONE OF THESE CREATURES
COULD HAVE AUTHORED HIS DEMISE.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.644
- WE'RE GOING TO NEED
REINFORCEMENTS.

15:24.690 --> 15:25.645
- OOH...

15:25.690 --> 15:27.180
WHO YOU THINKING
OF GOING WITH?

15:27.220 --> 15:35.525
*

15:37.430 --> 15:38.727
- YOU SAID YOU HAD
A PRIORITY-ONE CASE

15:38.770 --> 15:40.089
THAT INVOLVED MY SKILLS?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.199
- YES, YOUR DANCING SKILLS.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.629
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M WHIP CHATTERLY.

15:44.670 --> 15:47.230
- LOOK, DAD,
WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE HOURS

15:47.280 --> 15:49.430
TO QUESTION
ALL THESE VOLUPTUOUS WOMEN.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.539
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
WOODY'S ABOUT TO GET FIRED.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.969
- I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.711
COUNT ME IN.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.082
DOES THE NAME BOB WHITE
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.997
- CAN'T SAY THAT IT DOES.

16:07.030 --> 16:10.022
CAN I CALL YOU CAPTAIN MAGIC?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.765
- YEAH.

16:11.800 --> 16:16.032
- DOES THIS MAN'S IMAGE
INCITE ANYTHING IN YOU?

16:16.070 --> 16:19.733
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.
I DON'T DO THREE-WAYS.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.274
- I WAS WONDERING--
- SHH.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.449
- DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH,
BROWN SUGAR,

16:25.480 --> 16:28.017
YOU JUST LET SANDY
HOLD YOU TIGHT,

16:28.050 --> 16:30.780
AND ALL THE PAIN
WILL MELT AWAY LIKE BUTTER.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.050
- [chuckles]

16:33.090 --> 16:35.012
ACTUALLY, I'M DOING GREAT,

16:35.060 --> 16:38.655
BUT MY FRIEND BOB WHITE--
SO SAD.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.294
DID YOU KNOW HIM?
- [gasp5]

16:48.700 --> 16:51.168
WHAT?

16:51.210 --> 16:53.178
OH, I'M THE A-HOLE?

16:53.210 --> 16:56.077
- SHAWN! SHAWN!

16:57.680 --> 16:59.045
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY

16:59.080 --> 17:01.173
WOULD WANT TO KILL
THAT POOR LITTLE MAN.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.347
- REALLY?
WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?

17:03.390 --> 17:06.109
- BECAUSE BOBBY
WOULDN'T HURT A FLY.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.710
HE USED TO COME IN HERE
AND DANCE WITH ME FOR HOURS,

17:08.760 --> 17:10.387
'CAUSE HE JUST LOST HIS MAMA.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.729
[sighs]
HE'D LAY HIS HEAD RIGHT HERE.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.489
I'D JUST LET HIM FALL ASLEEP.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.361
- THAT'S SOUNDS REAL NICE.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.526
- UH, SHAWN?

17:18.570 --> 17:20.834
- HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.

17:20.870 --> 17:22.428
- SANDY, DID ROB
COME HERE TO DANCE

17:22.470 --> 17:24.563
AND NAP ON YOUR BOSOM
TWO NIGHTS AGO?

17:24.610 --> 17:26.134
- HE DID.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.104
IT WAS THE WORST
I'VE EVER SEEN HIM.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.334
HE SEEMED PARANOID.

17:29.380 --> 17:32.577
AND HE KEPT GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT SOMEBODY FOLLOWING HIM.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.817
- BEING FOLLOWED--
OOH!

17:34.850 --> 17:36.579
THIS REMINDS ME OF A CASE

17:36.620 --> 17:39.487
THAT OCCURRED
IN SALT LAKE CITY IN 1992.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.216
OH, IT WAS A STORMY WINTER--
- SPIT IT OUT, WHIP.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.626
I THINK GUS IS LOSING
CONSCIOUSNESS.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.287
- I THINK OUR KILLER
WAS SCOUTING BOB.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.456
I MEAN, HE'S A LONELY GUY,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.149
YOU KNOW,
KEPT A REGULAR ROUTINE.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.224
WHO WOULD MISS HIM?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.795
- SANDY, WHERE WOULD BOB GO
WHEN HE WAS FINISHED

17:52.830 --> 17:54.138
WITH THE PLEASURE
OF YOUR COMPANY?

17:54.170 --> 17:57.469
- THE OTHER NIGHT
HE SEEMED SO DOWN,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.137
SO I SENT HIM
TO A FRIEND OF MINE.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.876
I ASKED HER
FOR A SPECIAL FAVOR.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.799
- YOU SENT HIM TO A BROTHEL?
- WHAT? NO.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.546
MY GIRL OPERATES
ON A MORE SPIRITUAL LEVEL.

18:11.550 --> 18:16.681
- GENTLEMEN, WE STAND FOUR HOURS
FROM BOB WHITE'S LAST BREATH.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.190
- HUH.
- THIS IS ALL YOU, SHAWNIE BOY.

18:20.230 --> 18:21.527
- HEY, SUCK IT, GUS.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.267
- WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE.

18:24.300 --> 18:28.361
- MS. IVANA, OUR FRIEND
SHAWN HERE IS A PSYCHIC, TOO.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.231
MAYBE YOU WANT TO TEST HIM OUT
BEFORE YOU ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.339
- DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:31.370 --> 18:33.235
- [Russian accent]
SHH. NO TALK.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.235
YOU, LOOK AT MY BRAIN.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.304
- I'D RATHER NOT.
- DO IT.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.205
- OKAY.
- WHAT DO YOU SEE?

18:37.250 --> 18:40.310
- UM...

18:42.250 --> 18:44.218
OH, YOU...

18:44.250 --> 18:46.184
ARE PUTTING UP A WALL.

18:46.220 --> 18:50.179
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE
YOUR NAKED, INNERMOST THOUGHTS.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.583
- TRUE.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.349
I HAVE TRUST ISSUES.
MY THERAPIST TELLS ME THIS.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.267
YOUR TURN.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.291
- HAVE AT IT.
I'M AN OPEN BOOK.

18:59.330 --> 19:00.331
[grunts]

19:00.370 --> 19:03.430
- [breathes deeply]

19:03.470 --> 19:05.267
YOU'RE THINKING...

19:05.310 --> 19:08.404
WHETHER TED KNIGHT
AND JIM J. BULLOCK

19:08.440 --> 19:12.547
HAD ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT
ON THE SET OF...

19:12.580 --> 19:14.218
TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.877
- [grunts]

19:15.920 --> 19:17.615
- [gasp5]

19:17.650 --> 19:18.912
- HOLY CRAP.
SHE'S THE REAL DEAL.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.282
- WOW.
YOUR TURN AGAIN, SHAWN.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.719
THIS TIME TRY TO LET
YOUR GUARD DOWN.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.228
- GUS,
WE'RE HERE TO INVESTIGATE.

19:25.260 --> 19:28.423
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THIS MAN.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.268
- GOLLY,
HOW MANY POTTED PLANTS

19:38.310 --> 19:40.301
DOES IT TAKE TO SPELL LOSER?

19:40.340 --> 19:42.433
TURNS OUT THIS WAS A SUICIDE,
I CAN'T SAY I BLAME THE GUY.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.368
- OH, DON'T BE UGLY, CARLTON.

19:44.410 --> 19:45.547
- WHAT?

19:45.580 --> 19:49.277
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO CHECK--

19:49.320 --> 19:50.389
THE EMPTY ANSWERING MACHINE

19:50.420 --> 19:52.911
OR THE LETTERS
ADDRESSED TO "RESIDENT"?

19:52.950 --> 19:56.408
- YES, HE CAME TO SEE ME
THE OTHER NIGHT.

19:56.460 --> 19:57.427
HE WAS VERY SAD.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.587
HE TELLS ME HE'S IN LOVE
WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

19:59.630 --> 20:00.619
- REALLY?

20:00.660 --> 20:02.298
WHAT'S HER NAME?
- PENNY.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.322
HE SAID SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL,
HE CAN WATCH HER ALL DAY LONG,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.338
POURING THE TEA
OR READING THE PAPER.

20:07.370 --> 20:09.463
EVEN THE WAY SHE FOLDING
THE LAUNDRY

20:09.500 --> 20:11.400
IS A THING OF BEAUTY.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.305
SO I TELL HIM
SHE CARES FOR HIM.

20:13.340 --> 20:14.978
- OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

20:15.010 --> 20:17.274
SHE WAS INTO OLD BOB, HUH?

20:17.310 --> 20:18.948
- NO.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.847
I ONLY TOLD HIM THIS
BECAUSE BIG SANDY ASKED ME TO.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.643
I OWE HER A FAVOR
FOR INTRODUCING ME

20:23.690 --> 20:26.341
TO CHAD LOWE AT PAJAMA PARTY
AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.857
- YOU LIED TO HIM?

20:27.890 --> 20:29.357
- I HAD TO.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.381
CHAD WASN'T GOING TO GET
WITH A FORTUNE TELLER.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.025
- NOT TALKING ABOUT CHAD.
I AM TALKING ABOUT BOB.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.721
- YES.
HIM TOO.

20:36.760 --> 20:37.727
- OH.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.522
- BUT HE WAS SO HAPPY.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.629
- HE RUSH OUT OF HERE
TO GO AND SEE HER.

20:41.670 --> 20:45.458
- THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.568
SHAME YOUR FACE.

20:46.610 --> 20:47.907
POOR BOB.

20:47.940 --> 20:49.476
- WHO IS NOW VERY, VERY SAD.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.978
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
MOSTLY BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.341
- [American accent]
SAY WHAT?

20:53.380 --> 20:54.938
- MURDER!
- NUH-UH.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.015
- HOPE YOU'RE SATISFIED.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.745
- OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS.
SERIOUSLY?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.382
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.479
I'M GOING TO HELL
IN A HANDBASKET.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.522
- UH...
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR ACCENT?

21:03.560 --> 21:06.927
- PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE
WHEN I USE IT?

21:06.960 --> 21:09.554
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.819
WE ARE LEAVING.
- TO FIND A GIRL NAMED PENNY.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.360
- [gasp5]

21:14.400 --> 21:16.038
- WHAT THE--

21:16.070 --> 21:18.436
DAMN, GIRL,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

21:18.470 --> 21:20.700
- I SEE DEATH IN YOU.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.970
- ME? NO.

21:23.010 --> 21:25.899
- THE REAPER IS COMING
TO COLLECT YOUR SOUL.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.577
- NO, NO.
WRONG AGAIN.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.872
UM, OH, SEE,
YES, I GET THIS ALL THE TIME.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.583
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, IT'S BECAUSE
DEATH IS MY BUSINESS.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.451
- [speaking foreign language]

21:35.490 --> 21:37.048
- DON'T.

21:37.090 --> 21:40.491
AH, OH,
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

21:40.530 --> 21:44.022
I'VE GOT A DEAD TOOTH
AND, UM, A TOENAIL

21:44.070 --> 21:45.469
THAT'S GONE COMPLETELY BLACK.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.798
- LEAVE, NOW.
ALL OF YOU, GET OUT. SHOO!

21:47.840 --> 21:49.091
- OKAY.
- SHOO!

21:49.140 --> 21:50.630
- DON'T GOT TO
TELL ME TWICE.

21:50.670 --> 21:54.709
- BAD JUJU, BAD JUJU,
BAD JUJU.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.777
- WELL,
THAT WAS UNSAVORY.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.471
- DON'T SWEAT IT,
WHIP, OKAY?

21:59.510 --> 22:00.738
SHE WAS A FREAK.
TRUST ME.

22:00.780 --> 22:01.974
FULL OF "BOLOGNA."

22:02.020 --> 22:03.112
- YEAH, THAT SHORTY
WAS WACK.

22:03.150 --> 22:07.655
- GENTLEMEN, I APPRECIATE
YOU BOTH WORKING OVERTIME

22:07.690 --> 22:11.649
TO PUT ME AT EASE,
BUT I THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME

22:11.690 --> 22:15.524
I LEAVE THE RESIDUE
OF THIS DEADLY CRYPTOGRAM

22:15.560 --> 22:20.930
TO THOSE FAR MORE EQUIPPED
TO DECODE IT THAN I.

22:20.970 --> 22:25.703
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT I'M FREAKED OUT.

22:25.740 --> 22:26.900
[sobbing]

22:26.940 --> 22:28.874
- I GUESS THE LEAST
WE CAN DO IS, UH--

22:28.910 --> 22:30.707
WE'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.502
OW. WHAT?
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

22:32.550 --> 22:34.575
- WELL, LOOK AT HIM.
- MUCH APPRECIATED.

22:34.620 --> 22:38.613
UM, WOULD IT BE OUT OF LINE
TO MAKE A QUICK STOP AT ARBY'S

22:38.650 --> 22:41.653
ON THE WAY HOME?

22:41.690 --> 22:44.352
- NO, IT WOULD NOT.
THAT'S HAPPENING, FOR SURE.

22:47.730 --> 22:49.527
- I'LL BE DAMNED.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.028
HEY, O'HARA,
I GOT SOMETHING.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.492
- PENNY?
- YEAH.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.939
- YEAH.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.632
LOOKS LIKE MR. LONELY
WASN'T SO LONELY AFTER ALL.

22:57.670 --> 22:58.898
- WELL, LET'S PAY HER A VISIT

22:58.940 --> 23:00.669
AND MAKE THIS
LITTLE PIGGY SQUEAL.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.598
- OR WE COULD JUST
ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.972
- WE COULD.
IT'S NEVER AS MUCH FUN.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.773
[cell phone rings]
- HEY, SHAWN.

23:06.810 --> 23:09.745
- JULES, I'M HAVING
A VERY STRONG FEELING

23:09.780 --> 23:13.989
ABOUT OUR GUY BOB
AND THE NAME PENNY.

23:14.020 --> 23:18.559
DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

23:18.590 --> 23:20.182
- YEAH, IT DOES.

23:20.230 --> 23:21.390
- I GOT TO TELL YOU, LASSIE,

23:21.430 --> 23:24.524
INVESTIGATING THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
HAS BEEN PRETTY BIZARRE--

23:24.570 --> 23:25.628
UNDERBELLY.

23:25.670 --> 23:26.762
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
AFTER HOURS.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.734
- WITHOUT THE ACCOMPANYING
PRESENCE OF GRIFFIN DUNNE.

23:28.770 --> 23:29.794
- PLEASE, SPENCER.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.899
IF ANYONE KNOWS THE UNDERBELLY
OF SANTA BARBARA,

23:31.940 --> 23:33.669
IT'S ME, SO I'LL DO
THE TALKING, ALL RIGHT?

23:33.710 --> 23:34.734
I KNOW THESE PEOPLE,

23:34.780 --> 23:37.476
AND I'M A HIGHLY TRAINED
COMMUNICATOR ABLE TO ADAPT

23:37.510 --> 23:39.774
INTO ANY SITUATION
LIKE A MASTER CHAMELEON.

23:39.810 --> 23:41.072
both: YOU'RE NOT
A MASTER CHAMELEON.

23:41.120 --> 23:43.611
- NO?
WATCH THIS.

23:43.650 --> 23:46.949
[knocks on door]
- IT'S OPEN.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.185
- PENNY CHALMERS.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.926
- OF COURSE.
WHO ELSE WOULD I BE, SILLY?

23:53.960 --> 23:56.895
- I AM NOT SILLY.
IN FACT, I'M QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.568
HEAD DETECTIVE CARL LASSITER
OF THE S.B.P.D.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.828
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT BOB WHITE.

23:59.870 --> 24:02.930
- OH, YEAH.
WELL, COME ON IN.

24:02.970 --> 24:05.666
I'M JUST ABOUT
TO MAKE SOME TEA.

24:05.710 --> 24:06.734
- OH, YEAH.

24:06.770 --> 24:08.499
THIS GIRL'S GOT UNDERBELLY
WRITTEN ALL OVER HER.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.576
- DETECT IVES,
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.669
MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

24:12.710 --> 24:15.873
[applause]

24:17.850 --> 24:19.715
- LOOK UP, SEBASTIAN.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.684
THIS COULD GET INTERESTING.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.723
- BREAK A LEG, MASTER C.

24:31.130 --> 24:34.588
- [clears throat]
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

24:34.640 --> 24:37.768
- HE SAID SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL
THAT HE CAN WATCH HER ALL DAY--

24:37.810 --> 24:40.529
THE WAY SHE POURS THE TEA
OR READS THE PAPER.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.708
- OH, SHE'S
A PERFORMANCE ARTIST.

24:43.750 --> 24:44.842
- OH.
- OH.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.643
- GUYS LIKE BOB WHITE
PAY MONEY

24:46.680 --> 24:49.547
TO WATCH HER LIVE
HER EVERYDAY LIFE.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.081
- YOU SERIOUS?

24:51.120 --> 24:53.111
- ALL RIGHT, BEATNIKS,
SHOW'S OVER.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.219
HIT THE ROAD.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.512
- [laughing]

24:56.560 --> 24:59.825
[applause]

24:59.860 --> 25:01.657
- ARE YOU PEOPLE DENSE?

25:01.700 --> 25:03.964
THIS IS OFFICIAL POLICE
BUSINESS--GET OUT OF HERE.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.298
- [laughs]

25:06.330 --> 25:08.833
- WHOO-WHOO.

25:08.870 --> 25:11.259
- SPENCER, YOU GONNA
HELP ME OUT HERE?

25:11.310 --> 25:14.199
- YES, WE ARE.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.209
[applause]

25:19.150 --> 25:21.311
- THE FEMALE COP'S GOT
A PRESENCE,

25:21.350 --> 25:23.818
BUT DETECTIVE GANGLY'S
A BIT STIFF, DON'T YOU THINK?

25:23.850 --> 25:26.148
- HMM.
- HEY, OFFICER.

25:26.190 --> 25:27.953
NO NEED TO BE NERVOUS.
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

25:27.990 --> 25:32.029
THIS IS JUST LIFE IMITATING
ART--NO LINES, JUST LIFE.

25:32.060 --> 25:35.598
SO GO AHEAD,
ASK ME ANYTHING YOU WANT.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.565
- UH, LOOK, MISS...
I, UM---

25:38.600 --> 25:40.192
- WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.333
_ UH--

25:41.370 --> 25:44.032
- DO YOU KNOW BOB WHITE?

25:44.070 --> 25:46.607
- WELL, YEAH.
WHY?

25:46.640 --> 25:48.073
- WELL,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW

25:48.110 --> 25:49.600
IF YOU WANT
AN AUDIENCE FOR THIS,

25:49.640 --> 25:51.949
BUT BOB IS DEAD.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.574
[audience gasps]

25:54.620 --> 25:57.214
- MY SWEET BOBBY IS DEAD?

25:57.250 --> 25:59.741
- WE BELIEVE HE WAS MURDERED.

25:59.790 --> 26:04.284
- [sobbing]
OH, BOBBY.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.150
- KIND OF CLICHE.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.896
- WELL, SOMEONE MAY HAVE BEEN
STALKING HIM FOR A WHILE,

26:07.930 --> 26:10.194
IF THAT HELPS.
- OH, YEAH, THAT DOES.

26:10.230 --> 26:11.766
- [crying]
OH, BOBBY, NO...

26:11.800 --> 26:12.698
- ALL RIGHT, THAT IS IT.

26:12.730 --> 26:14.630
YOU EITHER GET
THESE PEOPLE OUT OF HERE,

26:14.670 --> 26:16.160
OR I'M GOING TO HAUL YOU
DOWNTOWN.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.031
WE'RE GONNA SET UP ALL
THE CHAIRS IN A HOLDING CELL.

26:18.070 --> 26:19.628
HOW'S THAT
FOR HONESTY AND TRUTH?

26:19.670 --> 26:21.706
- DOES THAT COST EXTRA?
- GET THEM OUT OF HERE.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.809
- LET'S GO.
COME ON.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.681
- SEE YOU NEXT TIME.
BYE.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.119
THANKS--THANKS FOR COMING.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.721
- DID YOU COMPLETE
THE RESIDUE TEST

26:41.760 --> 26:43.762
ON THOSE FINGERNAILS
LIKE A GOOD BOY?

26:43.800 --> 26:45.165
- I DID.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.089
I FOUND A MIXTURE OF PIGMENT
FILLERS IN THE NAIL BEDS.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.789
- IS THERE ANYTHING HOTTER

26:49.840 --> 26:52.638
THAN A MAN SCALING
ANOTHER MAN'S DEAD CUTICLES?

26:52.670 --> 26:53.637
- NO.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.830
AND BY THE WAY,

26:55.880 --> 26:59.976
I REALIZE I'M ACTUALLY ACUTELY
TURNED ON BY TAKING ORDERS

27:00.010 --> 27:01.739
FROM A WOMAN.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.748
IF THIS CONTINUES,
I MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE

27:03.790 --> 27:06.941
MY FACEBOOK RELATIONSHIP STATUS
TO "IT'S COMPLICATED."

27:06.990 --> 27:08.810
- ARE YOU TRYING TO SEDUCE ME?

27:08.860 --> 27:11.351
- MAYBE.
IS IT WORKING?

27:11.390 --> 27:16.191
- IT'S NOT
NOT WORKING.

27:16.230 --> 27:19.165
HOW'S ELAINE?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.326
- WE'RE SEPARATED.

27:20.370 --> 27:22.736
SHE CHEATED ON ME
12 TIMES WITH 10 MEN.

27:22.770 --> 27:27.230
- NOT A VERY SMART WOMAN.
- THAT'S WHY I MARRIED HER.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.931
- YOU KNOW, I DO NOT APPRECIATE
BEING MADE A PART

27:28.980 --> 27:30.299
OF YOUR LITTLE DOG
AND PONY SHOW.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.876
- OH, I DON'T WORK
WITH ANIMALS.

27:31.910 --> 27:32.979
- YOU THINK
I'M KIDDING AROUND?

27:33.010 --> 27:35.376
I CAN TAKE YOU DOWNTOWN
FOR OBSTRUCT ION OF JUSTICE.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.980
- EASY, OKAY?
I'M A PERFORMANCE ARTIST.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.715
I JUST THOUGHT I'D TAKE
THE OPPORTUNITY

27:39.750 --> 27:42.116
TO MILK THE DRAMA WHEN A BUNCH
OF DETECTIVES SHOWED UP.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.855
- THAT IS AN ODD WAY
TO MAKE A LIVING.

27:43.890 --> 27:46.688
- IT'S WAY LESS CREEPY
THAN DOING WEBCAM FEEDS.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.857
AND SURE BEATS THE HELL
OF MY LAST GIG.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.289
DOING SPOTS
FOR "HOWZA MEATS."

27:51.330 --> 27:53.195
- WAIT A SECOND.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.835
YOU'RE THE BOLOGNA GIRL?
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED YOU.

27:55.870 --> 27:57.030
I JUST
COULDN'T REMEMBER WHERE.

27:57.070 --> 27:59.300
* HOWZA HOWZA HOWZA MEATS?
YOU TELL ME *

27:59.340 --> 28:01.035
* BO--BO--BO--BOLONGA

28:01.080 --> 28:02.479
- YOU QUITE DONE, GUSTER?

28:02.510 --> 28:06.241
* BO--BO--BO--BOLONGA

28:06.280 --> 28:09.249
SHE DOES IT TWICE
IN THE COMMERCIAL.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.282
- YEAH, I DO IT TWICE.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.844
- I'M DONE.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.858
- WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT BOB WHITE?

28:14.890 --> 28:17.927
- HE WOULD COME TO THE SHOW MOST
EVERY DAY, BUT WE NEVER SPOKE.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.849
TWO NIGHTS AGO, HE CAME IN.
IT WAS REALLY LATE.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.027
I TOLD HIM THE SHOW
WAS OVER FOR THE NIGHT,

28:23.060 --> 28:25.164
AND HE INSISTED
ON COMING IN,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.361
AND THEN HE PROFESSED
HIS LOVE FOR ME.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.766
HE SAID THAT A FORTUNE TELLER
TOLD HIM I LOVED HIM, TOO.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.698
[scoffs]

28:30.740 --> 28:34.403
- [imitating Thai accent]
HE HAD NO HONEY.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.431
[normal voice]
THAT IS NOT OFFENSIVE.

28:36.480 --> 28:38.175
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW
THE WHITE WAITER SOUNDED.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.939
GUS WAS THERE.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.039
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU LET HIM DOWN EASY.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.241
I'M SENSING HE WAS
VERY--VERY VULNERABLE.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.814
- I THREATENED
TO CALL THE COPS.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.078
- BUT YOU'RE
THE BOLOGNA GIRL.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.917
- YEAH, BUT I'M ALSO
A SINGLE GIRL IN THE CITY.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.485
- WHO INVITES AN ENTIRE
AUDIENCE OF STRANGERS

28:51.530 --> 28:52.781
INTO HER APARTMENT?

28:52.830 --> 28:53.854
- ANY IDEA WHERE HE WENT

28:53.900 --> 28:55.253
AFTER YOU RIPPED HIS HEART OUT
AND STEPPED ON IT?

28:55.300 --> 28:56.449
- I WATCHED HIM
FROM THE WINDOW.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.967
HE WALKED
DOWN THE STREET,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.968
AN THEN THIS BLACK IMPALA
PULLED UP,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.490
AND THEN HE WAS TALKING TO
THE DRIVER, AND THEN HE GOT IN.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.008
- GREAT. IT'S ONLY THE MOST
POPULAR CAR IN AMERICA.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.905
- WHAT TIME DID
ALL OF THIS GO DOWN?

29:05.940 --> 29:07.066
- MIDNIGHT.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.135
- WELL, HE DIED AROUND 1:00,

29:09.180 --> 29:11.045
WHICH MEANS WHOEVER PICKED HIM
UP IN THAT CAR

29:11.080 --> 29:12.843
IS PROBABLY THE LAST PERSON
WHO SAW HIM ALIVE,

29:12.880 --> 29:16.111
MOST LIKELY BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO
THE PERSON WHO KILLED HIM.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.778
- * BO--BO--BO--BOLONGA

29:21.820 --> 29:24.948
- HELLO, BOYS.

29:24.990 --> 29:27.993
[sighs]
I HAD TO GO TO THREE STORES

29:28.030 --> 29:30.021
TO FIND CREAM FRESH
FOR OUR STRAWBERRIES.

29:30.060 --> 29:34.338
- WELL, I THINK WE SQUEEZED ALL
WE CAN OUT OF THESE INTESTINES.

29:34.370 --> 29:35.860
MMM!

29:35.900 --> 29:37.333
WORTH THE WAIT.
THAT IS FRESH FRESH.

29:37.370 --> 29:40.066
WE ARE QUITE THE TEAM,
GRACE AND I.

29:40.110 --> 29:41.202
AS IT TURNS OUT,

29:41.240 --> 29:45.108
WE ALSO STILL ENJOY BOTH
JERRY GARCIA AND CHERRY GARCIA.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.072
[both laughing]

29:47.110 --> 29:49.374
- GUYS, UH,
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.344
SOMEONE DROVE HIM AWAY
IN WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN,

29:52.390 --> 29:53.345
UH, AN IMPALA?

29:53.390 --> 29:54.550
- MM-HMM.
- 'PALA.

29:54.590 --> 29:56.319
OKAY, AND THAT'S
WHERE THE TRAIL RUNS COLD.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.021
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS POSITIVELY DISGUSTING.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.482
- WHY ARE YOU STILL
MESSING WITH THAT?

29:59.530 --> 30:02.158
- BECAUSE IT FEELS AMAZING.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.419
OH, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS WILL MEAN TO YOU,

30:05.470 --> 30:10.260
BUT I FOUND A MIXTURE OF
CALCIUM CARBONATE TITANIUM OXIDE

30:10.300 --> 30:12.439
AND PIGMENT FILLERS
IN THE NAIL BEDS.

30:12.470 --> 30:13.937
- HMM.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.971
THOSE ARE THE COMMON ELEMENTS
OF ACRYLIC STAINS.

30:16.010 --> 30:16.829
- PAINT.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.177
- I WAS--I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.075
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.
- RIGHT, GUSTER.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.112
IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A STRING
OF MURIATIC ACID.

30:22.150 --> 30:23.174
THAT'S A PRESERVING AGENT.

30:23.220 --> 30:25.085
WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING
ABOUT AN OUTDOOR LOCATION.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.587
- YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

30:26.620 --> 30:29.214
- YOU WANT MORE PLUM CAKE?
- I DO, BUT, NO.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.957
YOU PRESERVE A MURAL.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.218
- I WATCHED HIM FROM THE WINDOW.

30:34.260 --> 30:37.024
HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET,
AND THIS BLACK IMPALA PULLS UP,

30:37.060 --> 30:38.891
AND HE WAS TALKING
TO THE DRIVER,

30:38.930 --> 30:41.933
AND THEN HE GOT IN.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.437
- OKEYDOKE.

30:43.470 --> 30:46.007
THE KILLER DROVE BOB
TO THIS ALLEY FROM PENNY'S,

30:46.040 --> 30:48.076
MADE HIM GET OUT,
TURNS HIM AROUND,

30:48.110 --> 30:49.202
BOOM! BLUDGEONS HIM
OVER THE HEAD.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.174
SO DO IT, BLUDGEON ME.
- WHAT?

30:51.210 --> 30:52.575
- BLUDGEON ME.
- WHY ME, SHAWN?

30:52.610 --> 30:54.578
- ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN
ABOUT BEING A VICTIM.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.474
NOW I AM OFFERING YOU
THE ROLE OF THE KILLER

30:56.520 --> 30:58.112
JUST LIKE BLAIR UNDERWOOD
IN JUST CAUSE,

30:58.150 --> 30:59.481
AND YOU'RE GONNA PASS?
- I DON'T WANT TO BLUDGEON YOU.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.112
- JUST DO IT.
- I DON'T WANT TO BLUDGEON YOU.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.115
- BLUDGEON ME, BLUDGEON ME,
BLUDGEON ME, BLUDGEON ME.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.025
- I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.618
- [groans]

31:05.660 --> 31:09.289
[grunts]

31:09.330 --> 31:12.424
[sighs]

31:25.450 --> 31:28.317
HOLY CRAP.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.112
WHIP'S OUR KILLER.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.344
- WHAT?
- LOOK...

31:33.390 --> 31:35.915
HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED US
TO SOLVE THIS MURDER.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.520
- HE WANTED TO GET CAUGHT.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.584
- WITH ONE TERRIBLE ACT,

31:39.630 --> 31:42.224
SOMEONE CAN BE IMMORTALIZED
FOREVER.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.125
I THINK IT'S FASCINATING.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.229
- EXACTLY.

31:46.270 --> 31:49.034
HE WANTS TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY
JUST LIKE ALL THE KILLERS

31:49.070 --> 31:51.038
THAT HE STUDIES,
AND IF THIS GOES UNSOLVED,

31:51.070 --> 31:52.628
THEN NO ONE IS GOING TO WRITE
ABOUT IT.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.070
AH, I BET
HE SEVERED THE EARLOBE

31:55.110 --> 31:56.270
JUST TO LAUNCH
THE INVESTIGATION.

31:56.310 --> 31:57.231
- THAT'S WHY HE WANTED
TO TAG ALONG--

31:57.280 --> 31:58.645
TO MAKE SURE WE FIGURED OUT
ALL THE CLUES.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.840
- OF COURSE.

31:59.880 --> 32:02.440
THIS THING IS SO TWISTED,
IT CAN ONLY COME FROM A BOOK.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.118
I'M CALLING LASSIE.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.448
WE'LL HAVE HIM MEET US
AT WHIP'S.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.355
- THE BLACK IMPALA.

32:11.390 --> 32:15.394
- CHATTERLY,
GET OUT OF THE CAR!

32:15.430 --> 32:18.661
- WE'VE GOT A BODY.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.168
- WE GOT SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.533
"THANK YOU, SHAWN AND GUS,
FOR BEING THE SLEUTHS

32:24.570 --> 32:26.401
"I ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE...

32:26.440 --> 32:28.135
"AND FOR HELPING ME
FIND MY RIGHTFUL PLACE

32:28.180 --> 32:30.068
"IN THE ANNALS
OF MURDER HISTORY.

32:30.110 --> 32:32.340
FILE THIS UNDER 'C'
FOR CHATTERLY."

32:32.380 --> 32:35.144
- JEEZ, WHIP.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.511
- I KNEW IT.

32:36.550 --> 32:40.111
- YOU DID NOT.
- I KIND OF DID.

32:41.590 --> 32:44.684
- DAMN YOU, WHIP CHATTERLY--
YOU ENSNARED US IN A WEB

32:44.730 --> 32:46.721
WITH TURTLENECK LIES,
AND NOW BECAUSE OF YOU,

32:46.760 --> 32:49.092
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SNACKS.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.496
- YOU JUST CAN'T TELL
WHAT A PERSON IS CAPABLE OF

32:51.530 --> 32:53.589
UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN
THEM NAKED.

32:53.630 --> 32:55.234
- HMM.

32:55.270 --> 32:57.431
- I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
THAT'S HOW THE SAYING GOES.

32:57.470 --> 32:58.664
- MM...
- CAKESTERS?

32:58.710 --> 33:00.337
- YOU BETCHA.

33:00.370 --> 33:03.373
- YEP, I HAVE
LEARNED MY LESSON.

33:03.410 --> 33:05.503
IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU GUYS,
I'D BE OUT OF A JOB.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.438
- WELL...
- FROM NOW ON...

33:07.480 --> 33:10.017
I'M NOT HALF-ASSING
ANY AUTOPSIES

33:10.050 --> 33:11.347
UNLESS THE CORPSE
HAS HALF AN ASS.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.587
[laughter]

33:14.620 --> 33:16.417
YOU GOT TO KEEP
IT LIGHT, GUYS.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.018
- SURE DO.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.357
- I THINK WE'RE GONNA ROLL,
WOODSTER.

33:19.390 --> 33:22.120
WE GOT BACK-TO-BACK EPISODES
OF HOT IN CLEVELAND ON TWO,

33:22.160 --> 33:24.367
AND WE'RE PRETTY SPENT.
- YEAH.

33:24.400 --> 33:28.461
- WHOA, GUS.
I HAVE A MISSED CALL FROM WHIP.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.489
- WHAT?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.428
- YEAH, LIKE, AN HOUR BEFORE
WE FOUND HIS BODY.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.165
HE LEFT A MESSAGE.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.474
[static over phone]

33:35.510 --> 33:37.808
[gunshot, thud]

33:37.840 --> 33:39.569
- CREEPIEST BUTT-DIAL EVER.

33:39.610 --> 33:40.838
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I GOT TO HEAR THAT AGAIN.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.178
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, SHAWN?
THE MAN IS COMMITTING SUICIDE.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.710
- SHH.
LISTEN.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.185
[gunshot, thud]

33:49.220 --> 33:50.448
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DOES
THAT SOUND LIKE TO YOU?

33:50.490 --> 33:52.424
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YES, YOU DO.

33:52.460 --> 33:54.599
THERE'S A CAR DOOR SLAMMING
AFTER THE GUNSHOT.

33:54.630 --> 33:56.291
WE GOT TO GO BACK
TO WHIP'S BOOKSTORE.

33:56.330 --> 33:58.719
- WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE,
SHAWN?

33:58.770 --> 34:01.068
- LOOKING FOR SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE.

34:01.100 --> 34:02.328
- OH, GOSH.

34:02.370 --> 34:05.066
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE FOR ONE
MORE SECOND THAN WE HAVE TO BE.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.066
_ THIS DOESN'T ADD UP, GUS,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

34:07.110 --> 34:10.534
AND WE'RE GOING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY.

34:10.580 --> 34:11.569
- WHAT?

34:11.610 --> 34:13.373
COME ONE, SON.

34:13.410 --> 34:15.446
- YOU'RE GONNA DRINK
A DEAD MAN'S YOO-HOO?

34:15.480 --> 34:18.187
- YOU HAD TO PUT THAT IMAGE
IN MY HEAD, DIDN'T YOU?

34:18.220 --> 34:19.482
THE MAN MAY BE DEAD,

34:19.520 --> 34:21.454
BUT THAT YOO-HOO IS
VERY MUCH ALIVE, SHAWN.

34:21.490 --> 34:24.152
- I'M GOING INSIDE.
- YEAH, SUCK IT.

34:32.630 --> 34:35.133
- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE FOR
LETTING A YOO-HOO GO TO WASTE.

34:35.170 --> 34:36.467
- WHIP DID.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.604
- THIS INVESTIGATION
IS NOT OVER, AND YOU KNOW IT.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.232
- SHAWN,
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

34:40.270 --> 34:41.578
- I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN ONE OF THOSE MOVIES

34:41.610 --> 34:43.532
WHERE A LITTLE JAPANESE KID
IN DEATH MAKEUP

34:43.580 --> 34:45.309
IS GOING TO BE UP
ON THE CEILING LIKE A FROG

34:45.350 --> 34:47.568
IF I LOOK UP.
- SO DON'T LOOK UP.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.441
BESIDES, WHY WOULD YOU
POSSIBLY FEEL THAT WAY?

34:49.480 --> 34:50.708
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.615
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE?
YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE CEILING.

34:52.650 --> 34:53.480
- I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.454
MAYBE BECAUSE
I'M STARVING TO DEATH.

34:55.490 --> 34:56.559
- I GAVE YOU MY CAKESTER.

34:56.590 --> 34:57.682
- THAT WAS ALMOST
HALF AN HOUR AGO.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.688
- [clicks tongue]
COME ON, SON.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.731
WAIT FOR IT.

35:15.840 --> 35:19.640
- DUDE.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.716
- WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

35:26.790 --> 35:31.113
WHY IS WHIP WATCHING
OLD SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE?

35:50.710 --> 35:51.938
- SO WE HAVE FIVE TAPES.

35:51.980 --> 35:53.641
AND ON EACH ONE OF THEM,

35:53.680 --> 35:58.310
THE SAME WEIRDO'S READING
ONE OF THESE FIVE BOOKS.

35:58.350 --> 35:59.783
- IN THIS CASE,
AN ILLINOIS FARMER

35:59.820 --> 36:02.550
HAD SEEMINGLY BEEN RUN OVER
BY HIS OWN TRACTOR,

36:02.590 --> 36:05.423
BUT LATER, IT WAS DISCOVERED
HE WAS KILLED WITH CYANIDE

36:05.460 --> 36:07.951
BY A DWARF BEFORE HE EVER EVEN
GOT ON THAT TRACTOR.

36:07.990 --> 36:12.825
THEY NEVER CAUGHT
THAT LITTLE FELLOW.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.191
- DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.432
- AAH.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.870
OH, YOU SCARED ME.

36:22.910 --> 36:26.903
ARE THOSE HOMEMADE BISCOTTI?
- IS THERE ANY OTHER KIND?

36:26.950 --> 36:29.771
- YOU LOOK HAPPY.
- WELL, I GUESS I AM.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.845
DO YOU STILL TAKE SUGAR
WITH YOUR JOE?

36:31.890 --> 36:34.882
- MM.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.324
- HEY, WHAT IS ALL THAT?
- YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.782
LET'S PRETEND WE'RE DOING
AN EPISODE OF RED SHOE DIARIES.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.593
- WELL, NOT IF THERE'S WORK
TO BE DONE.

36:41.630 --> 36:42.790
- FINE.

36:42.830 --> 36:45.367
THE CONTENTS
OF WHIP CHATTERLY'S ESOPHAGUS.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.867
- OH, I THOUGHT
THE CASE WAS CLOSED.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.765
- IT IS.
IT WAS.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.791
OR...
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.330
NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

36:52.370 --> 36:53.860
THESE WERE FOLDED UP
INTO TINY BITS

36:53.910 --> 36:56.834
AND PUT INSIDE
THIS METAL CAPSULE.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.907
- THIS IS NEW EVIDENCE,
AND IT COULD BE A GAME CHANGER.

37:00.950 --> 37:03.418
I THINK WE MAY HAVE TO PULL
ANOTHER ALL-NIGHTER.

37:03.450 --> 37:04.712
GOD, I LOVE THIS JOB.

37:04.750 --> 37:07.389
- YOU KNOW, I DO, TOO.

37:08.890 --> 37:12.951
- OKAY, CLEARLY THERE'S A REASON
WHEY THESE PAGES ARE TORN.

37:12.990 --> 37:16.027
- DUDE,
I THINK WHIP WAS FRAMED.

37:16.060 --> 37:17.357
- WHY?

37:17.400 --> 37:18.662
- BECAUSE HE WAS
THE PERFECT MARK--

37:18.700 --> 37:20.019
A WEIRDO OBSESSED WITH DEATH
AND STRANGE MURDERS

37:20.070 --> 37:21.731
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

37:21.770 --> 37:22.862
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T QUESTION IT
FOR A SECOND

37:22.900 --> 37:23.832
WHEN WE HEARD
HIS SUICIDE CONFESSION.

37:23.870 --> 37:25.906
THINK ABOUT IT.
- SO IT WAS CREEPY SHERLOCK.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.805
WELL, IT MAKES SENSE.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.432
I MEAN, HE OBVIOUSLY DID ALL
OF HIS RESEARCH

37:29.480 --> 37:30.401
RIGHT HERE IN WHIP'S STORE.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.408
HE PROBABLY EVEN HAD
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

37:32.450 --> 37:33.974
- THAT'S SICK.

37:34.010 --> 37:36.945
- THE ONE NIGHT THAT THERE'S
A MURDER, AND I WAS SLEEPING.

37:36.980 --> 37:37.969
UNBELIEVABLE--
I NEVER SLEEP.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.409
- OH.

37:40.450 --> 37:43.886
HE MUST HAVE DRUGGED
WHIP'S COFFEE.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.457
- THAT'S WHY HE FELL ASLEEP THE
NIGHT BOB WHITE WAS MURDERED.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.492
HE TOOK WHIP'S CAR.
HE TOOK WHIP'S STAMP.

37:48.530 --> 37:50.953
AND HE PUT IT ALL BACK BEFORE
HE EVER KNEW WHAT HIT HIM.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.025
- OH, MAN, NOW I FEEL BAD.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.391
POOR WHIP.
YOU KNOW, HE WAS A FUNNY GUY.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.759
I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT ROCKING THE TURTLENECK,

37:56.800 --> 37:57.937
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD SAY,

37:57.970 --> 37:59.961
AND THEN WHAT PEOPLE
AT WORK WOULD SAY.

38:00.010 --> 38:01.705
WHIP NEVER WORRIED ABOUT STUFF
LIKE THAT--HE WAS FEARLESS.

38:01.740 --> 38:02.934
- GUS?
- WHAT?

38:02.980 --> 38:04.948
- THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY NOT GOOD.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.972
- WELL, WE CAN SEND THESE
TO THE LAB IN THE MORNING

38:08.010 --> 38:10.012
AND DUST THEM FOR PRINTS.

38:10.050 --> 38:11.312
[cell phone rings]
- OH, THAT'S ODD.

38:11.350 --> 38:14.046
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING HOME
TO WATCH HOT IN CLEVELAND.

38:14.090 --> 38:15.910
HE MUST HAVE COME UP
WITH SOMETHING AS WELL.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.724
I SHOULD FILL HIM IN.
- UM...

38:18.760 --> 38:20.785
I'M AFRAID THAT'S
NOT GOING TO BE POSSIBLE.

38:20.830 --> 38:23.719
- WELL, IT'S SUCH AN EASY TASK,
EVEN I CAN'T SCREW IT UP.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.660
HAVE SOME FAITH, BANANA.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.998
[chuckling]

38:28.030 --> 38:31.568
- GRACE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S EVIDENCE.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.339
- YOU JUST HAD TO GO
AND RUIN EVERYTHING,

38:33.370 --> 38:34.598
DIDN'T YOU, WOODY?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.801
I MEAN, THE CASE WAS CLOSED.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.047
ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTED
TO THIS DUMMY DOING IT.

38:39.080 --> 38:41.469
I MEAN, HE EVEN CONFESSED.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.114
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS COVER HIM UP,

38:44.150 --> 38:47.017
EAT SOME COOKIES,
AND THEN TAKE ME TO BED.

38:47.050 --> 38:50.053
- HEY, WE CAN STILL
GO TWO FOR THREE.

38:50.090 --> 38:51.580
[gun cocks]

38:51.630 --> 38:52.858
[gasp5]

38:52.890 --> 38:55.029
- LET'S GO.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.392
- GRACE, IT'S--IT'S WOODY.

38:57.430 --> 38:58.988
DON'T YOU OWE ME
AN EXPLANATION?

38:59.030 --> 39:01.123
- YOU WANT ANEESXPLANATION?

39:01.170 --> 39:04.059
- OKAY.
WHIP CHATTERLY SET ME UP

39:04.100 --> 39:06.409
BY SWALLOWING
THAT LITTLE CAPSULE.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.738
HE WAS SMARTER THAN I GAVE HIM
CREDIT FOR--

39:08.780 --> 39:11.943
CRAFTY,
LIKE A LITTLE FOX.

39:11.980 --> 39:13.709
I MEAN, WHOSE FINGERPRINTS
DO YOU THINK

39:13.750 --> 39:14.978
THE LAB IS GOING TO FIND

39:15.020 --> 39:17.477
ON THOSE STUPID LITTLE
PIECES OF PAPER, HUH?

39:17.520 --> 39:21.911
FOR 25 YEARS, I HAVE BEEN
PUTTING MAKEUP ON CORPSES,

39:21.960 --> 39:23.086
DREAMING OF THE DAY

39:23.120 --> 39:26.089
THAT I WOULD GET THE CALL
WHEN SOMEBODY WOULD TELL ME

39:26.130 --> 39:29.622
THAT I WAS AS GOOD
AS WOODY STRODE--

39:29.660 --> 39:32.720
TEACHER'S PET, BRILLIANT,
BUT MISUNDERSTOOD.

39:32.770 --> 39:35.637
- A DREAM WORTH KILLING FOR?
COME ON.

39:35.670 --> 39:39.458
- I HAVE APPLIED
FOR EVERY OPENING

39:39.510 --> 39:41.102
IN CRIME PATHOLOGY

39:41.140 --> 39:44.644
THIS SIDE OF THE GULF OF MEXICO,
WITH NO SUCCESS.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.569
AND THEN I MET BOB WHITE.

39:47.610 --> 39:50.579
AND I REALIZED
THAT HE WAS THE PERFECT MARK.

39:50.620 --> 39:53.646
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS REALLY
KIND OF A MERCY KILLING.

39:53.690 --> 39:56.079
BUT WHEN I GOT THE IDEA
OF PINNING THE MURDER

39:56.120 --> 40:00.386
ON WHIP CHATTERLY,
IT WAS EPIC.

40:01.860 --> 40:05.421
I BROKE OPEN THE CASE,
AND I SOLVED IT.

40:06.870 --> 40:08.189
[gunshot]

40:14.510 --> 40:17.434
- YOU SLICED THE EARLOBE
AFTER MY AUTOPSY, DIDN'T YOU?

40:17.480 --> 40:19.698
- YES, MUTTONHEAD, I DID.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.047
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:21.080 --> 40:23.810
YOU AND THE POLICE
HAD RULED IT AN ACCIDENT,

40:23.850 --> 40:25.841
BUT I NEEDED IT
TO BE AN INVESTIGATION.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.518
- YOU KNOW,
YOU MAY NOT REALIZE THIS, GRACE,

40:28.560 --> 40:31.120
BUT YOU'RE INSANE.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.926
- WELL, I'M A WOMAN,
AND I CAN MASK IT.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.928
LET'S GO.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.099
- YOU'RE TOTALLY GOING TO PULL
THIS OFF, AREN'T YOU?

40:39.130 --> 40:41.667
NO, I'M NOT READY TO DIE YET.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.930
I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO SEE
GLORIA ESTEFAN IN CONCERT YET.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.460
PLEASE.
PLEASE, GRACE.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.239
I WILL GET DOWN ON MY KNEES,

40:47.270 --> 40:49.830
AND I WILL BEG
LIKE A SAINT BERNARD.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.973
NO.

40:52.010 --> 40:54.171
- THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

40:54.210 --> 40:57.111
PUT IT DOWN, GRACE.
- OH, THANK GOD.

40:59.020 --> 41:00.715
- WELL, THAT WAS QUITE
THE ALL-NIGHTER, WOODROW.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.980
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY THAT O'HARA
WAS STILL HERE DOING PAPERWORK

41:03.020 --> 41:04.578
WHEN SHAWN CALLED.

41:04.630 --> 41:07.485
- CHIEF, UH, I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT, UH...

41:07.530 --> 41:09.725
HEY, I ONLY CRIED
BECAUSE I WAS TIRED.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.489
- THAT'S REASSU RING.

41:11.530 --> 41:14.533
YOUR STATUS AS CHIEF CORONER
HAS BEEN FULLY RESTORED.

41:14.570 --> 41:15.992
all: YES!

41:16.040 --> 41:17.689
- THAT SAID,
I EXPECT YOUR WORK

41:17.740 --> 41:19.765
TO BE NOTHING SHORT
OF EXEMPLARY MOVING FORWARD.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.505
IS THAT CLEAR?

41:21.540 --> 41:24.270
- IT IS, AND I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH FOR BELIEVING IN ME.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.073
- I DIDN'T.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.543
I BELIEVED IN YOUR COLLEAGUE

41:27.580 --> 41:28.740
WHO TURNED OUT
TO BE A HOMICIDAL MANIAC.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.975
- NONE OF US IS PERFECT,
CHIEF.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.887
- THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT FOR ME.
- [chuckles]

41:33.920 --> 41:36.684
- I LOVE YOU, GUYS.
I MEAN THAT.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.927
IT'S JUST AS EASY FOR ME
TO LOVE A MAN AS IT IS A WOMAN.

41:38.960 --> 41:42.999
WE'RE ALL JUST MELTABLE FLESH
AND BREAKABLE BONES.

41:43.030 --> 41:44.668
WOW, THIS FEELS GOOD!

41:44.700 --> 41:46.122
CHIEF, ARE YOU
CURRENTLY SEEING ANYONE?

41:46.170 --> 41:47.660
- EXCUSE ME?
- WOODY.

41:47.700 --> 41:48.860
- DON'T BE COY WITH ME.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.095
I DON'T NEED TO PLAY FIRST
FIDDLE IN THIS BLUEGRASS BAND.

41:51.140 --> 41:52.732
TEACH ME THE NOTES.
[chuckles]

41:52.770 --> 41:54.977
- I AM MARRIED WITH A CHILD,

41:55.010 --> 41:57.137
AND THIS IS WILDLY
INAPPROPRIATE.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.148
- STOP IT.
- OF COURSE.

41:59.180 --> 42:01.000
OF COURSE. I APOLOGIZE.

42:01.050 --> 42:04.884
I AM JUST SO OVERJOYED
AT GETTING MY MOJO BACK.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.182
I GUESS IT WILL
JUST BE IN MY DREAMS

42:06.220 --> 42:07.778
THAT YOU ARE
THE CHIEF OF DOING ME.

42:07.820 --> 42:11.051
- GOOD TALK, CHIEF.
- ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
