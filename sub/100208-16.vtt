10:39.464 --> 10:41.292
Give me, uh, two minutes.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.998
NANCY:
Hey, Ryan.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.695
No, I just gave another
statement on my wife's murder.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.218
I'm really not in the mood.

10:54.262 --> 10:57.221
I know that you didn't
write that e-mail to Lucy.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.920
About hoping that she'd die.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.143
[quietly]:
Come here.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.539
It came from an I.P. address in Lisbon.

11:10.582 --> 11:13.629
Where, according to Forbes, your
dad was busy acquiring a company

11:13.673 --> 11:15.370
in 2000.

11:15.413 --> 11:18.678
Why would Everett impersonate
you in an e-mail to Lucy?

11:18.721 --> 11:20.070
I don't know.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.724
Okay, well, then,
let's find out.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.987
It is high time
that you tell me the whole truth

11:24.031 --> 11:26.033
about your relationship
with Lucy.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.165
Or I will turn those e-mails
over to the judge

11:28.209 --> 11:29.993
when I testify later today.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.561
I do not think
that you killed Lucy.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.084
But I do think

11:34.128 --> 11:37.174
that you are the key
to finding out who did.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.828
Please, Ryan.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.138
Okay.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.793
Okay.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.980
Well, I'll be.
This is Lucy Sable.
[shushes]

12:00.023 --> 12:01.764
[whispers]: The cops
are right outside the door.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.027
If we're to believe
Karen Hart's report,

12:04.071 --> 12:06.116
Joshua Dodd came in
through this back door,

12:06.160 --> 12:07.335
poisoned the victim's food
in there.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.816
[clattering]

12:11.774 --> 12:14.646
We'll start in the dining room.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.136
Now all we need
to do is stop them

12:26.180 --> 12:28.835
going into the cooler
in a non-suspicious way.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.880
Piece of cake.
GEORGE: Yeah. It would've been a lot cakier

12:30.924 --> 12:32.403
if you would let me handle it.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.405
Private party? Where are
the private partygoers?

12:34.449 --> 12:37.017
Oh, it is a far better deterrent
than "inventory."

12:37.060 --> 12:40.542
GEORGE:
Oh, yeah, says you.
Now I've got to slow them down.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.849
Who wants brunch? On the house.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.548
Hey. Except we can't get
to the food in the cooler.

12:46.591 --> 12:49.116
So then go grab sardines
and saltines from the back.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.378
What are you waiting for?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.119
[stammers]

12:52.162 --> 12:53.598
GEORGE:
Go.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.644
Oh, my God.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.867
What? He should have let me
handle it with the cops.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.608
Okay? We're co-bosses. We don't
have to "co" everything.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.827
Okay.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
What? Okay, listen,
if you've maxed out

13:06.873 --> 13:09.005
on "co's" before you've even
kissed each other,

13:09.049 --> 13:11.094
then maybe it's a sign

13:11.138 --> 13:13.227
you shouldn't be together.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.230
[whispers]:
Come on.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.015

Okay.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.451
RYAN:
After the Velvet Masque,

13:20.495 --> 13:21.975
Lucy and I had to keep
our relationship

13:22.018 --> 13:23.411
a secret from my parents.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.587
Then your dad
found out in spring,

13:25.630 --> 13:28.590
and he made Lucy break up with
you and then he sent this e-mail

13:28.633 --> 13:31.027
to make sure
she stayed away for good.

13:31.071 --> 13:34.291
Why did you keep your
relationship with Lucy a secret,

13:34.335 --> 13:36.337
even after she died?

13:38.556 --> 13:40.167
I had to.

13:42.169 --> 13:46.869
I came to Horseshoe Bay
that night to see her.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.871
At least I tried, anyway.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.873
And what happened?

13:50.917 --> 13:53.223
I did everything that I could
to get here, you know?

13:53.267 --> 13:56.226
I-I hopped a school fence,
I hitchhiked, and then finally,

13:56.270 --> 13:58.663
when I-I got here,
there were police everywhere

13:58.707 --> 14:01.405
and people were saying
that Lucy had been murdered.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.886
You know? And I-I blame myself,
because I thought maybe

14:03.930 --> 14:05.888
if I could've gotten here
a little bit earlier,

14:05.932 --> 14:07.847
she might still be alive.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.067
But then I-I realized
how it would look.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.417
You know? We've been hiding
our relationship for months,

14:13.461 --> 14:16.899
and then all of a sudden, the
night that I show up, she dies?

14:16.943 --> 14:19.554
So I left before anybody
could identify me.

14:19.597 --> 14:20.947
Nancy, I...

14:20.990 --> 14:23.906
I loved Lucy.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.649
I was just, I was too afraid
to mourn her, so I buried it.

14:30.478 --> 14:34.699
Your dad must have read
your school e-mails.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.093
That's the only way he would
have known that you and Lucy

14:37.137 --> 14:39.182
were gonna meet
at your spot that night.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.444
The bluffs?

14:41.706 --> 14:43.926
The bluffs wasn't our spot.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.147

What was it, then?

This place hasn't changed

14:55.677 --> 14:57.418
CINDY:
Well, that's the charm of it.

14:57.461 --> 15:01.074
My dad's had me scooping since
I could reach the ice cream.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.640
So, were you working the night

15:02.684 --> 15:05.165
of the Sea Queen ceremony
in 2000?

15:05.208 --> 15:08.168
Anything to miss the
lamest event of the year.

15:08.211 --> 15:11.649
Did, uh, did-did Lucy Sable
come in that night?

15:11.693 --> 15:14.391
Sure did.
NANCY: And you didn't tell that to the cops?

15:14.435 --> 15:17.133
There's no record
of it in her file.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.963
Yeah, they didn't
take me seriously.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.531
Especially with everyone
phoning in bogus tips.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.967
But they should have.

15:25.011 --> 15:28.014
Why? What happened?

15:29.537 --> 15:30.930
Well, Lucy came in...

15:30.973 --> 15:34.107
Um, she had
this little pink backpack.

15:34.150 --> 15:37.066
She was wearing her Sea Queen
dress and sash,

15:37.110 --> 15:39.982
but she didn't look
like she'd won anything.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.028
She was so sad.

15:42.071 --> 15:46.162
Just writing in her journal,
waiting for someone.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.296
How long, how long did she wait?

15:49.339 --> 15:52.560
CINDY:
Long enough for her ice cream to melt.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.345
Eventually she left.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.565
Uh, and that's when I noticed
a town car was following her.

15:57.608 --> 16:00.655
It had this, uh,
eagle hood ornament.

16:01.699 --> 16:04.050
That's my dad's car.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.753
A couple months before
Lucy was murdered,

16:11.796 --> 16:13.755
you sent her an e-mail
from Ryan's account

16:13.798 --> 16:16.149
saying that you hoped she'd die.

16:16.192 --> 16:19.587
Oh, look, she's back.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.633
I want to know
what happened to Lucy.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.159
Why'd you do that to her?

16:30.424 --> 16:34.036
You were throwing away
your future on a nothing girl.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.211
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:35.255 --> 16:37.300
Your grades were abysmal.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.781
You slept through
how many crew practices?

16:39.824 --> 16:42.784
Okay, the night that Lucy died,

16:42.827 --> 16:46.309
you knew he was supposed to meet
her, but you got there first.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.312
I offered her a ride
so we could chat.

16:57.103 --> 17:00.019
Did you hurt her? Don't be so dramatic.

17:00.062 --> 17:05.850
I simply reminded her again
to stay away from my family.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.331
Advice I could offer you
as well.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.682
When I left,

17:11.726 --> 17:14.729
Lucy was walking up
to her house, very alive.

17:14.772 --> 17:18.733
In fact, a friend
was waiting for her.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.388
They got into an argument.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.218
What friend?

17:26.741 --> 17:28.830
It was the cop
that tried to kill you, Ryan.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.922
As far as I know, Karen Hart

17:33.965 --> 17:36.707
was the last person
to see Lucy alive.

17:59.295 --> 18:03.343
Why were you arguing with Lucy
the night she died?

18:05.040 --> 18:06.998
Junior year, rumors spread

18:07.042 --> 18:09.784
that Lucy was sleeping
with hill-toppers.

18:09.827 --> 18:13.831
She became withdrawn, depressed.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.529
I hardly saw her.

18:15.572 --> 18:19.446
But she'd, uh, she'd always
wanted to be Sea Queen,

18:19.489 --> 18:22.275
so I nominated her
to try to cheer her up.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.713
You entered a social pariah

18:25.756 --> 18:28.585
into a popularity contest
to cheer her up?

18:30.196 --> 18:33.155
I switched out the ballot box
so that she'd win.

18:33.199 --> 18:37.116
I wanted everyone to see her
for who she was. A Sea Queen.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.900
Not a slut.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.989
But your plan
backfired because...

18:41.032 --> 18:44.253
then everybody thought that
she slept her way to victory.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.780
[sighs]
I felt awful.

18:49.824 --> 18:53.175

tried to explain myself.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.308

18:55.351 --> 18:56.918

18:56.961 --> 18:58.441
Please, please.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.926
I waited for her outside,
but by the time she came out,

19:04.969 --> 19:07.537
she made it clear
that she wanted to be alone.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.365
Let me explain.

19:09.409 --> 19:13.152

19:13.195 --> 19:14.588
Just leave me alone.

19:33.694 --> 19:36.262
she had her backpack
and her journal.

19:36.305 --> 19:39.613
But she had nothing
on her when she left.

38:34.399 --> 38:37.140
CARSON;
We told her that we would
figure everything out.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.968
We, we just wanted to help.

38:41.014 --> 38:44.931
Lucy begged us
to take her child.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.367
And raise it.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.021
Don't let the Hudsons
know about her.

38:48.064 --> 38:50.502
CARSON:
And protect it from the Hudsons.

38:50.545 --> 38:51.894
We didn't know what to say,
we just...

38:51.938 --> 38:53.113
It's okay.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.462
...we had to calm her down...

38:54.506 --> 38:56.508
It's okay.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.772
Take care of my baby...

38:59.815 --> 39:03.558
...long enough to get help.

39:08.694 --> 39:13.089
We'd only turned away
from her for a second.

39:13.133 --> 39:17.659
When we turned back,
Lucy was... gone.

39:17.703 --> 39:20.706
I climbed down to the water
to try and find Lucy,

39:20.749 --> 39:22.316
but...

39:25.014 --> 39:27.452
I couldn't find her.

39:27.495 --> 39:31.194
Her body had already
washed out to sea.

39:33.022 --> 39:36.678
All that was left was her dress.

39:36.722 --> 39:42.205
We never knew
if she had slipped or jumped.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.643
And through the rest
of that night,

39:44.686 --> 39:47.036
we held the baby in our arms,

39:47.080 --> 39:49.299
weighing what we should do.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.607
And by the time the sun rose
the next morning,

39:52.651 --> 39:54.304
the only thing we cared about

39:54.348 --> 39:57.133
was honoring
her mother's dying wish

39:57.177 --> 39:58.221
and keeping her safe.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.223
[baby crying]

40:00.267 --> 40:02.704
And we'd fallen in love.

40:05.228 --> 40:08.362
We decided to leave
Horseshoe Bay

40:08.406 --> 40:12.279
to keep the baby's origin
a secret.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.549
Couple years later,
we came back.

40:21.593 --> 40:24.160
Things were safer by then.

40:24.204 --> 40:25.858
Everyone believed she was ours.

40:27.860 --> 40:31.429
And we decided to stay
and raise her here.

40:32.473 --> 40:35.433
All I've ever cared about

40:35.476 --> 40:39.524
is giving her a good life.

40:39.567 --> 40:42.091
One where she'd never
have to know the truth.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.008
I was her father now.

40:46.052 --> 40:49.316
I was her father.
And that's all that mattered.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.845
Lucy's baby thrived.

40:58.020 --> 41:01.241
She grew up to be whip-smart

41:01.284 --> 41:05.637
and compassionate
and kind and...

41:05.680 --> 41:08.291
endlessly curious.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.297
And she loves solving mysteries.

41:18.127 --> 41:20.086
[crying]

41:20.129 --> 41:23.524
Your DNA wasn't a match
for the female hair.

41:23.568 --> 41:26.919
It's a mother-daughter match
for Lucy Sable.

41:32.141 --> 41:34.143
She's me.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.670
The baby is me.

42:04.783 --> 42:06.741
[woman screams, bell dings]

42:06.785 --> 42:08.743
[pencil scribbling]
