a wish for Christmas.

for Christmas this year?

I just want all the pain to stop,
all the killing.

I just want a normal life.

01:07:25.219 --> 01:07:27.721
Well, I hope you've been
a very good boy, Jeremy,

01:07:27.821 --> 01:07:30.542
'cause that's a very tall order.

to that little girl Julie?

01:07:54.465 --> 01:07:56.733
Please forgive me.
I've never been able to...

01:07:56.833 --> 01:08:02.189
That little girl, her mother...
her mother and I, well, let's just say...

01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:04.688
we were pretty close.

01:08:05.392 --> 01:08:07.949
Jeremy, that little girl you killed...

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:10.511
that was my daughter.

to forgive herself.

That was my family, mine!

01:08:29.216 --> 01:08:32.286
It's a good thing
I'm not a vengeful person.

Doesn't go well with the job,
you know what I mean?

01:08:36.407 --> 01:08:40.411
Hmm, and my brother,
I leave that up to him.

could have so much bad luck.

it's getting worse, it gets worse,

- Do you ever think about that, Jeremy?
- You son of a bitch.

01:09:10.457 --> 01:09:14.944
All these people had their faith in you
all these years, believing in you.

01:09:15.045 --> 01:09:19.200
- You piece of shit!
- You think I wanted any of this shit?

to justify your own miserable existence.

I'm a fucking god!

01:09:28.024 --> 01:09:31.928
You think of me as how you want me
to be, not as who I actually am!

01:09:32.028 --> 01:09:34.731
And you dare question my actions.

01:09:34.831 --> 01:09:39.620
You are no god! You're as bad as
the kids you and your brother punish.

Watch what you say, Jeremy.

01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:44.291
You can't do anything to me anymore.

when you took my wife and daughter.

There's nothing left to take any more,
you've taken it all.
