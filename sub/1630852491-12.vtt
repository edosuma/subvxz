WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.404
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.437 --> 00:06.174
What is so terrible about me
right now?

00:06.207 --> 00:08.176
You're just different.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.644
Moving here is the only way that
we are gonna stay a family.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.414
Did you, uh, fill
Sheila's job yet?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.149
No, but we're looking
at applicants.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.118
I'd like to be considered.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.553
-- Jack!
-- Jack!

00:19.587 --> 00:20.921
Jack!

00:20.954 --> 00:22.723
Jack?! Where are you?

00:23.757 --> 00:26.327
Hey. Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy, Grandma's here.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.028
I told you to listen
for the click.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.497
Maybe I would have
heard the click

00:29.530 --> 00:31.532
if you weren't yelling
at me all the time.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.735
I don't know if Toby and I
are gonna make it.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.505
Marriage...

00:37.538 --> 00:42.376
Marriage is what brings us
together today.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.178
Coming in, coming in,
I don't know the rules,

00:44.212 --> 00:46.180
but I gotta get something
cleared for the toast.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.848
I just need to know
if movie quotes

00:47.881 --> 00:49.617
-or impressions are allowed.
That's all.
-Yes.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.786
Yes. This is the last time
I'm doing this,

00:52.820 --> 00:54.622
so go crazy, brother.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.092
You look beautiful.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.627
Okay, get out. Get out.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.028
-Bye-bye.
-The whole thing,
it's really great.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.296
-- Bye!
-- Oh, come on.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.031
Geez, kill a guy
for trying to deliver

01:04.064 --> 01:05.799
a perfect wedding speech!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.568
Ah, your brother's an idiot.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.470
But he's right.
You are beautiful.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.739
Philip is going to lose it.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.742
You are the perfect bride.
And this is going to be

01:14.775 --> 01:16.043
the perfect day.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.579
Beth, we both know today
will go wrong

01:18.612 --> 01:21.482
in a thousand ways,
but it doesn't matter.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.818
Kate Pearson, you are
an incredibly zen bride.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.887
Have you been hitting my CBD pen
in that dressing room?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.290
No.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.468
Hello?

01:41.469 --> 01:43.103
Hi.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.640
Hi.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.310
Um, hey, listen, I know,
I know you're getting married

01:49.343 --> 01:52.513
in a few hours.
Um, congratulations.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.882
I just, I just
wanted to say...

01:58.319 --> 02:01.121
Kate, you know what
you said to me

02:01.155 --> 02:02.356
the day we signed
our divorce papers?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.164
Yeah, I remember.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.801
I want you to know...

02:13.834 --> 02:16.103
that I see it now.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.173
I'm sorry it took me so long.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.810
If only I'd had
a crystal ball,

02:22.843 --> 02:25.346
if I could've seen the way
that this all ended up.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.817
Yeah. Life would be much simpler

02:29.850 --> 02:32.253
if we could live it
backwards, huh?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.884
Well, they're both sleeping in.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.086
-Small miracles.
-Yeah.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.227
I imagine Jack is pretty spent.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.842
I am going to take
the job here in L.A.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.245
The one that I turned down.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.381
It'll be a huge step back
in my career,

03:33.414 --> 03:36.917
but I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to save our family.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.654
Okay.

03:44.458 --> 03:48.396
Um, we've got to go
to couples therapy.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.863
And I know that you haven't
wanted to in the past.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.634
I'll do it. I'll do it.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.935
Whatever it takes.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.977
Whatever it takes.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.079
-You're home!
-Okay, you ready to help me?

04:06.113 --> 04:08.649
This one? Okay.
Can you hand that one to Mama?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.050
-Be careful. Careful.
-Here you go, Mama.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.285
Oh, thank you.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.486
-- All right. Here we go.
-- Yes!

04:12.520 --> 04:13.887
There you go.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.756
Yeah, and so Toby
was trying really hard

04:15.789 --> 04:18.326
to make San Francisco work
for all of us.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.727
I mean, killing himself
basically,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.296
coming back and forth
every weekend...

04:22.330 --> 04:25.766
A-And Kate was incredible
with the kids.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.336
She picked up so much of
the slack while I was gone.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.880
I hope this classroom treats you
as well as it treated me.

04:41.549 --> 04:44.017
This is for you.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.089
Now, I'm going to start
walking you through

04:49.122 --> 04:51.158
your new duties as a supervisor.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.364
-This is your office.
-Oh. Right.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.369
Welcome aboard.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.804
Yeah, thank you.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.652
What's that song, Mama?

05:18.686 --> 05:21.555
That is a song that I'm teaching
the kiddos at school.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.627
-Hey. Hey.
-Hi.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.563
-How-how was your day?

05:29.597 --> 05:31.999
Oh, yeah, it was great. Yours?

05:33.601 --> 05:35.035
It was fine.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.247
I'm sure she'll be here
any minute.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.350
Traffic this time of day
can be so unpredictable.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.352
Yeah.

05:52.386 --> 05:54.087
We've been coming here
for six months.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.023
She knows how long it takes
to get here.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.661
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.663
Jack's teacher cornered me
at pickup

06:02.696 --> 06:06.066
and then he guilted me
into buying the new class bird.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.703
So, anyway, um,
I did my best. Sorry.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.104
Sure you did.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.741
What is that supposed to mean?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.378
Toby, it seems like
you're having feelings

06:18.412 --> 06:20.548
about Kate being late.

06:20.581 --> 06:26.286
I'm having feelings about
Kate being late again.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.889
You know, you could be
on time if you wanted to.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.624
You don't have to spend
20 minutes

06:30.658 --> 06:35.195
talking to Jack's teacher
every time you pick him up.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.631
I am polite to our
children's teacher

06:37.665 --> 06:39.199
because the way
that I treat them

06:39.232 --> 06:40.768
impacts the way they treat him.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.270
Something you might know if
you ever spent a second longer

06:43.303 --> 06:44.772
at his school
than you have to, right?

06:44.805 --> 06:46.373
Okay. Wow.
So now I'm not

06:46.406 --> 06:47.908
spending enough time
at Jack's school?

06:47.941 --> 06:50.043
Good to know.
Another secret test

06:50.077 --> 06:52.613
about our kids that I didn't
know I was failing.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.648
I am really so tired of this.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.249
Every day

06:56.283 --> 06:57.918
it's just like a different
version of the same fight.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.420
It's like we are trapped

07:00.454 --> 07:02.790
in a hellish version of
Groundhog Day.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.794
Dianne, you've met a lot
of miserable couples.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.562
Some make it, some don't.

07:08.596 --> 07:12.099
In your professional opinion,
which kind are we?

07:12.132 --> 07:14.802
First, she's not
a Magic 8 Ball, Toby.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.605
Okay? And maybe if you actually
listened when we come here,

07:17.638 --> 07:19.272
we might be in a different spot,
right?

07:19.306 --> 07:21.174
-You think that.
-Okay, you know what?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.309
Screw it.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.112
You can come late,
I can leave early.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.694
Great engagement party, guys.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.996
Have you started talking about
wedding venues yet?

07:43.030 --> 07:45.098
-Because I have thoughts.
-Yeah.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.767
We're going to Santa Ynez
next month.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.368
We're looking at this winery
with this beautiful courtyard.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.770
-This awesome fountain...
-Yeah.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.639
-Stuffed mushrooms. Elijah.
-What?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.306
You put this baby in me, you
will get me stuffed mushrooms!

07:53.340 --> 07:55.142
Hello, hello. All right.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.977
Hey! There they are.
The couple of the hour.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.812
Uh, this is Leslie.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.313
-Hi.
-Congratulations, you guys.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.215
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.217
Gosh, you look so familiar.
Have we met?

08:04.251 --> 08:05.886
-Oh, I-I don't think so.
-No.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.454
Oh.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.989
-Go on, do it. You can do it.
-Oh.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.223
It's fun.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.864
-Right.
-Of course, yeah.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.799
Of course.
You're the-the State Farm girl.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.167
-Yes!
-Yes.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.335
-So nice to meet you.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.404
She's not making
the family photo.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.173
-Don't even...
-What are you talking about?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.174
There's some potential there.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.408
-No?
-There was potential

08:28.441 --> 08:30.010
with the Verizon girl,
the iPhone girl,

08:30.043 --> 08:31.044
with the condom
commercial girl...

08:31.078 --> 08:33.013
The condom commercial girl.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.915
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe no-no photo.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.650
-Yeah. Right.
-Yeah.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.690
Hey, are you okay?

08:42.723 --> 08:45.025
Uh...

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
I told you she was going
to be here with her husband.

08:47.094 --> 08:50.664
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. It's fine.

08:50.698 --> 08:54.001
I-I'm glad you two are
good friends again anyway.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.235
Yeah.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.070
I'm gonna go say hi.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.909
-Hey!
-Hey.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.877
Kate, this spread is next level.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.246
I am burnt out on oysters, which
I didn't think was possible.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.082
But, uh, screw it,
I'm gonna have another one.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.684
-Good.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.352
I gotta go, Jae Won.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.354
No. No more calls. I'm at
my sister's engagement party.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.758
Bye. Sorry about that.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.460
Donor contributions
for my campaign are up 20%.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.729
He's very excited.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.866
Well, we are excited
to have a future senator

09:25.899 --> 09:27.067
at our engagement party.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.802
Oh, come on.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.538
Mom, you look beautiful.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.741
Thank you, sweetheart.
You, too.

09:33.774 --> 09:37.745
Oh, I am so, so happy for you.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.546
Thank you.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.348
And for you, too.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.786
Philip.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.621
Thank you.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.123
Yes.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.159
All right, let's bring Kate
up to the stage.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.327
Oh, if you'll excuse me.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.097
Excuse you where?
W-What's happening?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.131
You'll see.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.934
Oh, boy.

10:05.172 --> 10:09.810
Hi, everyone. Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.478
This is really special.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.514
A few years ago,

10:14.547 --> 10:17.517
on an unusually hot day
in Koreatown,

10:17.550 --> 10:20.854
this song changed everything
for us.

10:20.888 --> 10:23.323
So, uh, get your ass
up here, pal. Let's go.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.524
-- Philip!
-- Philip!

10:24.557 --> 10:25.859
-- Let's go.
-- Come on, Philip.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.127
-- You.
-- Come on, Philip!

10:27.160 --> 10:29.529
-- Philip! Philip!
-- Me and you.

10:29.562 --> 10:33.233
I knew it. Ah. All right.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.222
Everybody!

11:12.873 --> 11:15.809
Oh, see, you like it. Yeah.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.411
It's a great gift, guys.
Thank you very much.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.480
That song certainly isn't gonna
ruin my life at all, is it?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.018
Oh, my God,
I love his witty humor.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.319
-Oh.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.588
I'm gonna go get a drink.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.194
I mean, her bar's a little low
when it comes to "wit."

11:34.227 --> 11:36.229
But she's, you know,
she's the new Trojan girl,

11:36.263 --> 11:38.265
so if you ever
need any free condoms...

11:45.572 --> 11:47.875
Hey, Kate, how's the,
uh, how's work going?

11:47.908 --> 11:50.277
Yeah, great.
Last week was '90s week

11:50.310 --> 11:53.781
so, uh, the whole class
sang "Backstreet's Back."

11:53.814 --> 11:55.916
Pretty much my dream job.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.252
Now if it just paid something,
we'd really come out on top.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.657
Wow, Toby.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.895
It was a jab at the school,
not at you.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.631
Yeah. I'm gonna go put
the candles on the cake.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.025
Hey.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.774
How do I know...

12:57.044 --> 12:59.847
How do I know when it's time
to end a marriage?

13:07.354 --> 13:08.989
I think you'll know.

13:11.324 --> 13:14.161
If that time comes,
I think you'll know.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.168
If it comes to that,
if it comes to that...

13:23.536 --> 13:27.007
...you and the kids
will be fine. Okay?

13:29.742 --> 13:32.212
Look at me and Madison,
we managed to work things out.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.347
And I'm not saying
that's you and Toby.

13:36.716 --> 13:40.353
But if it is, you...
you will all be happy again.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.995
Hello? Do you have any eights?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.163
Huh? Oh, um, sorry, Jack.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.565
Um, no, go fish.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.201
Philip?

13:54.234 --> 13:56.203
-Jack? It's dinnertime.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.640
Don't worry. It's gonna go good.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.242
Thanks, pal.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.211
Spinach?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.645
Listen, I don't think
it's weird at all.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.380
Of course it is.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.482
You've got the entire
kindergarten chorus

14:09.516 --> 14:10.918
singing "Maneater."

14:10.951 --> 14:13.253
Whatever, they love it!

14:13.286 --> 14:15.188
Hey, listen,
you have my support.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.990
All right?
Whatever filth you decide

14:17.024 --> 14:18.525
to make those children sing,

14:18.558 --> 14:21.261
I will be at that piano,
accompanying you with bells on.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.831
Well, thank you, that is
what I like to hear.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.899
All right.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.536
Okay.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.774
Do you think you want
some desser...

14:35.976 --> 14:39.079
I'd accompany you anywhere
actually.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.215
Uh, I-I've known it
since our first date.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.017
You remember when
that mariachi band,

14:44.051 --> 14:45.785
they arrived at our table,

14:45.818 --> 14:49.923
and you took my hand,
and the rest is history.

14:49.957 --> 14:54.094
God, I love you, Kate.

14:54.127 --> 14:58.465
I love your germy, loud,
unrefined children.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.436
My time with you has just--

15:03.470 --> 15:06.573
it's just been the happiest
time of my life.

15:06.606 --> 15:11.544
So, um, what do you say
we-we make it official?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.913
Will you... Will you marry me?

15:15.682 --> 15:18.851
Oh, before you answer...
Okay, now. Now.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.023
Hailey, go, Hailey!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.495
Yes. Yes, I will marry you.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.896
Yeah!

15:36.970 --> 15:39.572
We've been seeing you
for 16 months.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.742
How much longer are we supposed
to keep coming here?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.277
Until we fix our marriage.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.817
When's the last time you two
had dinner together?

15:50.850 --> 15:52.719
Just the two of you?

15:59.559 --> 16:02.929
-Sweetie, sweetie,
just-just relax.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.665
Come on, Hailey.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.868
Hailey, Hailey, Hailey.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.304
Hailey, come on, come on. Shh.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.845
You look so nice.
I've always loved that dress.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.614
-Yeah, I know.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.150
Wow.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.152
Toby, dinner looks so good.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.486
Just trying
to make Dianne proud.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.156
Well, do you feel proud, Toby?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.723
What matters is how you feel.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.360
And, Kate,
how do Toby's feelings

16:33.393 --> 16:35.662
about his feelings
make you feel?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.502
How was work today?

16:42.535 --> 16:45.672
Ah. Fine.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.109
I got out of there at00
on the dot, so that's a bonus.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.679
Sorry.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.849
How was your day?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.587
-The usual.
-Mm.

17:07.927 --> 17:11.831
Mm. How was bedtime?
I heard a little drama.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.068
Yeah, Hailey was up in arms
that we couldn't do

17:15.102 --> 17:17.570
a sixth reading of Corduroy.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.240
Well, did you, uh, read
Hush Little Polar Bear last?

17:20.273 --> 17:22.242
'Cause it really winds her down.
You know.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.879
Uh, no. No, like I just said,

17:26.913 --> 17:30.250
she-she kind of had
a one-track mind for, uh,

17:30.283 --> 17:31.518
for Corduroy tonight.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.052
Okay.

17:36.756 --> 17:40.160
You know I put her
to bed all the time, right?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.629
No, you don't.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.865
Jesus.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.867
What? I mean, it's true.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.436
Like, you don't put her down
all the time.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.272
Okay. Here we go.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.574
Here we go what?
I heard her crying.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.876
And when I hear my daughter,
who never cries at bedtime,

17:56.909 --> 17:58.745
-crying at bedtime...
-Mm-hmm?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.647
I can't ask you about it to,
like, protect your ego?

18:00.680 --> 18:03.383
-I mean, just, I'm try...
-Yeah, maybe, for once,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.485
you could resist the urge
to criticize me.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.154
It wasn't a criticism...

18:07.187 --> 18:08.988
It certainly was a criticism.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.224
Okay, fine,
you put the kids to bed

18:11.258 --> 18:13.926
more often and they like it
better when you do it.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.396
Who cares? I do other things.
Like when they're sick,

18:16.429 --> 18:18.765
I use that little
snot grabber thing

18:18.798 --> 18:20.667
because it makes you gag.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.503
But do I make you feel guilty
about it? No. I just do it.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.571
Okay, well, congrats.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.339
You occasionally
clear their noses.

18:26.373 --> 18:29.176
Okay, enough! I am a good dad!
All right?

18:29.209 --> 18:32.479
I love my kids and they love me.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.648
And you criticizing everything
I do around them, it just--

18:35.682 --> 18:38.785
you suck the joy
out of being a dad.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.087
What joy? You look miserable
half the time you're with them.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.123
I look miserable because
you are in the room.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.394
Well, there it is.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.297
You know what? Yeah, there--
actually, th-there it is.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.466
There it is. All this time
working with Dianne

18:53.500 --> 18:56.002
trying to figure out how
we ended up where we are now.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.271
It's-it's not because
I lost a bunch of weight,

18:58.305 --> 19:01.441
it's not because it took me
too long to-to bond with Jack

19:01.474 --> 19:04.511
or I moved to San Francisco
or any of the other BS

19:04.544 --> 19:06.713
that we talk about in there.
Turns out,

19:06.746 --> 19:08.881
the only crime
that I can consistently

19:08.915 --> 19:12.752
find myself guilty of
is not being Jack Pearson.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.656
-Okay, wow.
-No!

19:16.689 --> 19:18.458
Admit it. This marriage
has been a rigged game.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.693
-What?
-I am sorry that I like

19:20.727 --> 19:24.063
putting on a suit to go to work
and Jack Pearson hated it.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.399
I'm sorry I don't
father my children exactly

19:26.433 --> 19:27.967
the way Jack Pearson did.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.470
I'm sorry that Jack Pearson died

19:30.503 --> 19:32.639
and you ended up having
to marry me instead of him!

19:32.672 --> 19:34.507
-Stop it!
-Mom, Dad, I need help!

19:36.409 --> 19:38.511
-KATE Jack?
-Jack?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.814
Boba Fett fell in the toilet.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.417
You guys have to stop yelling
now and get him out.

19:47.287 --> 19:51.057
Okay. Yeah. We'll get him out.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.226
Come on.
I'll help you back to bed.

20:05.938 --> 20:11.411
I promised myself that I would
never be like my parents.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.513
That I wouldn't put my kids
through listening

20:13.546 --> 20:15.448
to crap like that.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.093
It's over, Toby.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.933
It's time.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.576
Hey.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.978
Hi.

20:46.012 --> 20:50.383
Uh, I, uh, took the liberty
of ordering.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.051
Hope you like Guinness.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.654
Not really. But thanks.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.028
How about those Rams?

21:03.863 --> 21:08.267
Yeah, uh... we don't have to
do the whole small talk thing.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.902
Oh, thank God.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.572
Because I had absolutely
no follow-ups to

21:12.605 --> 21:14.741
"how about those Rams."

21:14.774 --> 21:16.576
Yeah. Thanks for coming.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.747
Um, I'll just, I'll-I'll
cut to the-the chase here.

21:20.780 --> 21:26.353
Um, you and Kate
are getting serious.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.855
Which means that you're going to
be spending a lot more time

21:28.888 --> 21:30.490
with Jack and Hailey.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.925
So I thought we were long
overdue for a real conversation

21:32.959 --> 21:36.529
about what I expect from you,

21:36.563 --> 21:38.831
regarding the way you behave
around them.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.533
Yeah. No, I totally agree.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.302
I too think it's important.

21:43.336 --> 21:46.673
Especially as, um...

21:46.706 --> 21:50.843
I plan to propose to Kate soon.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.346
I'm sorry to spring that on you.
If you need a moment...

21:53.380 --> 21:57.884
It's fine. I, uh,
I kind of saw that coming.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.055
Look, most importantly,

22:03.089 --> 22:05.057
is that you don't yell
around the kids.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.660
You don't yell around them
and you don't yell at them.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.962
Yeah, don't worry.
British people don't yell.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.198
Even when we're furious, we just

22:12.231 --> 22:14.000
wrinkle our noses
disapprovingly.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.641
I'm sure this is all pretty
rich coming from me, huh?

22:21.674 --> 22:24.977
Based on what you've heard
about me. As a dad.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.180
I've heard nothing
but good things as of late.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.783
Yeah. Not good enough, I guess.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.353
How do you mean?

22:39.191 --> 22:43.362
I thought if we worked hard,

22:43.396 --> 22:45.197
if we fixed what was broken,

22:45.231 --> 22:46.766
that we would...

22:48.601 --> 22:50.703
...that we would find our way
back to each other.

22:50.737 --> 22:53.005
But instead we got divorced
and, uh,

22:53.039 --> 22:54.974
Kate found her way to you. So...

22:56.976 --> 22:59.512
I-I'm sorry. This is, this is
kind of getting off the rails.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.715
Listen, Toby...

23:02.749 --> 23:07.720
there's not much I can say to
make this moment more palatable.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.722
But I will say...

23:11.924 --> 23:13.760
I love your children.

23:15.094 --> 23:18.698
And I consider it
a great privilege to...

23:18.731 --> 23:21.568
to help raise them.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.173
Th-Thank you.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.247
Was that a, uh, field goal then?

23:37.283 --> 23:39.452
Good God, man,
do you not even understand

23:39.486 --> 23:41.087
the objective of this game?

23:41.120 --> 23:43.723
I thought I did until just now.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.425
If you want to marry
Kate Pearson, you have to have

23:46.459 --> 23:48.928
at least a general understanding
of American football.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.230
It is a huge deal in her family.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.965
It was huge to her father.

23:57.269 --> 24:01.107
Um... look, okay,
American football

24:01.140 --> 24:03.442
is not that different
from soccer.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.746
Except instead of kicking
a ball into a goal,

24:06.779 --> 24:09.181
you're trying to carry a ball
into an end zone.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.019
It's over, Toby.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.056
It's time.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.341
This is the unit
that's available.

24:40.747 --> 24:46.653
Yeah, well, beige
is my favorite color.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.287
We just want to do whatever's
best for the kids.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.856
I'm glad to hear that.

24:49.889 --> 24:53.192
Divorce is never pleasant,
but it doesn't have to be ugly.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.995
The mediation process
helps you work together

24:56.028 --> 24:57.664
to decide the best way
to co-parent

24:57.697 --> 24:59.431
and divide assets.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.035
Floor B.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.203
Ground floor.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.250
Uh...

25:52.284 --> 25:53.352
Okay.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.862
-Oh, come on, you're lying.
-I'm not lying!

26:02.895 --> 26:04.764
I don't have a least
favorite student.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.866
I think they're all very sweet
in their own ways and...

26:06.899 --> 26:08.735
Ugh, you're no fun.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.804
Actually that is not true.
You are extremely fun.

26:11.838 --> 26:16.142
I am enjoying our first date
very much, Kate Pearson.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.744
Me, too.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.489
Oh, uh, that's okay.

26:30.522 --> 26:34.293
-Th-Thank you though.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.763
This-this kind of, like,
personal attention

26:36.796 --> 26:38.464
makes me very uncomfortable.

26:38.497 --> 26:40.767
Well, breathe. Breathe, Philip.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.136
We're gonna get through these
nice men playing music for us.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.347
Can you excuse me for a sec?

27:15.001 --> 27:16.803
Everything all right?

27:24.677 --> 27:26.412
Philip, listen to me.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.983
I was married to
a wonderful man.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.185
And we loved each other a lot.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.887
And it wasn't enough.

27:37.489 --> 27:42.194
We were both so scared
of pushing each other away

27:42.228 --> 27:45.631
that we just swallowed our
feelings, time after time.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.533
And I can never be in a
relationship like that again.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.435
Understood.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.840
So I'm gonna ask you directly.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.910
What are you doing with me?

27:57.944 --> 28:02.048
You are a serial womanizer

28:02.081 --> 28:04.650
who dates a string
of toothpick-sized women.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.253
I'm a recently divorced,

28:07.286 --> 28:11.057
non-toothpick-sized
mother of two.

28:12.424 --> 28:14.093
My life is...

28:14.126 --> 28:16.162
it's messy, it's complicated

28:16.195 --> 28:18.364
and it's hard.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.566
And you spend your life
avoiding those things.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.271
So I'm gonna ask you again.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.908
What are you doing?

28:31.744 --> 28:33.746
Wait, are you not skinny?
I hadn't noticed.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.848
Are you ser--
Okay, you know what?

28:35.882 --> 28:37.850
You're clearly not capable of
having a real conversation.

28:37.884 --> 28:41.720
No, it is extremely
presumptuous of you

28:41.754 --> 28:45.257
to assume that I've avoided
messiness and complication

28:45.291 --> 28:48.260
just because I don't go around
talking about my feelings

28:48.294 --> 28:51.430
all the time like you Americans
do, more specifically you do.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.234
As you know,
I was married once, too.

28:56.468 --> 29:00.973
And she was beautiful
in an imperfect way.

29:01.007 --> 29:05.044
Bit of a crooked nose.
But it worked for her.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.079
And she was blind.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.251
We were happy for
a really long time.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.221
But we had trouble conceiving.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.924
I thought it was just
a sign that we

29:17.957 --> 29:19.158
weren't meant to have children.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.428
But she was determined.

29:22.461 --> 29:25.764
You know, we did
three rounds of IVF.

29:25.798 --> 29:30.903
Yeah, it consumed our time,
drained our bank balance,

29:30.937 --> 29:34.807
just sucked all the lightness
and laughter out of our home.

29:37.276 --> 29:41.447
She said she wanted to try
a fourth time and...

29:41.480 --> 29:43.215
I refused.

29:44.516 --> 29:49.121
She said I was giving up
on our life together.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.990
And I said...

29:53.125 --> 29:57.163
I said I no longer recognized
our life together,

29:57.196 --> 30:00.799
so what was there to give up on?

30:00.833 --> 30:05.371
She of course then packed a bag
to go to her mother's.

30:05.404 --> 30:09.976
And, um...
I didn't even say goodbye

30:10.009 --> 30:12.078
when the cab came
to pick her up.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.288
She only made it five minutes
down the road

30:22.321 --> 30:25.191
before she was hit
by a drunk driver.

30:27.359 --> 30:31.197
Killed instantly.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.765
My God.

30:36.335 --> 30:40.739
So to, uh,
to answer your question...

30:40.772 --> 30:45.744
I am trying...

30:45.777 --> 30:49.148
to be happy again.

30:49.181 --> 30:53.319
And... you,
you make me happy.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.354
So...

30:55.387 --> 30:57.856
that is-is what I am doing.

31:01.027 --> 31:04.396
I hope that's a-- is that
a satisfactory answer?

31:05.697 --> 31:07.599
Yes, it is.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.169
Okay, good.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.610
Did you guys get a chance
to discuss

31:18.644 --> 31:20.379
your post-divorce housing plan
since our last session?

31:20.412 --> 31:22.514
Yes.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.350
We agreed that

31:24.383 --> 31:25.584
I would stay in the house
with the kids,

31:25.617 --> 31:28.220
and that Toby would get
a place nearby.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.309
Hi.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.746
Something
extraordinary has happened.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.249
They're both asleep.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.455
Can you believe it?

32:19.138 --> 32:21.273
You're both here.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.921
So, how was the petting zoo?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.523
Tuckered them out.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.526
Yeah. Yeah.
It was, uh, it was good.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.799
You know, Kate,
there's still time.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.168
We don't have to go through
with this.

32:54.573 --> 32:57.776
Toby, don't do this.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.645
We're signing the papers
in two days.

32:59.678 --> 33:05.784
We are getting better together,
aren't we?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.187
I mean, I-I'm making progress
with the kids, right?

33:10.922 --> 33:15.127
Yeah. Definitely. I see it.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.695
I feel it. I know they feel it.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.697
I think, I think we should go--

33:18.730 --> 33:20.132
we should go back
and see Dianne.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.734
That was where--
I wasn't, I wasn't really

33:22.768 --> 33:25.371
receptive to it at first,
but-but I-I will be this time.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.806
Toby, I don't want to
see Dianne again.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.809
I don't.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.711
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.881
Like, I-I feel like I can
actually breathe. You know?

33:35.914 --> 33:37.916
And I think that you're doing
so great with the kids

33:37.949 --> 33:40.652
because you have your space to
figure out your thing with them.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.054
Away from me.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.755
You know, they're happier, too.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.391
When they're with you,
when they're with me.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.593
Their smiles are starting
to come back.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.261
They will be happier--

33:49.295 --> 33:53.565
they will be happier
if we are back together.

33:53.599 --> 33:56.102
Did you not hear what he said
w-when he woke up?

33:57.203 --> 33:59.037
Yes.

34:04.276 --> 34:05.444
I know that in the long run...

34:05.477 --> 34:06.878
Kate, do not do this.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.715
Okay? Don't do this, please.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.085
I am terrified. I don't--
I don't want to be alone.

34:13.119 --> 34:15.020
Okay? I-I don't want to
have to start over.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.689
I don't want to have to live
half of my life without my kids.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.926
We can, we can, we can
get better. I know that we can.

34:20.959 --> 34:24.496
This cannot be the way
that our story ends.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.469
Please, please, please,
this-this-this cannot...

34:30.502 --> 34:33.139
this-this can't, this cannot be
the way that it ends. Okay?

34:35.841 --> 34:37.443
Toby.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.613
I'm sorry. I can't.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.182
I can't.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.993
Well, I guess that's
the last time

34:55.026 --> 34:57.028
that I'll ever kiss my wife.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.675
I'll-I'll see you Wednesday.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.310
It's gonna be another
scorcher, so...

35:30.862 --> 35:31.997
-Hi.
-Hi.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.201
It's a bit of a scorcher,
isn't it?

35:35.234 --> 35:36.968
It is.

35:37.002 --> 35:40.772
Thanks for offering to hang.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.843
Well, yeah, I remembered it
was a, uh, big morning for you.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.213
Thought you could use a friend.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.215
How was it?

35:50.816 --> 35:52.017
It was brutal.

35:57.756 --> 35:59.391
So, Koreatown, huh?

35:59.425 --> 36:00.892
Are we doing a little
post-signing

36:00.926 --> 36:02.160
the divorce papers bibimbap?

36:03.395 --> 36:05.731
Not exactly...

36:15.073 --> 36:16.408
you can play the piano.

36:18.043 --> 36:19.478
How am I singing
on my own now? Come on.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.673
Okay. You two made it
to the finish line.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.708
Hope you brought
your favorite pens,

36:49.741 --> 36:50.909
'cause we got a lot
of signing to do.

36:50.942 --> 36:54.413
Okay, let's get started.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.448
Right, this is
the joint petition.

36:56.482 --> 36:59.985
Okay? Here we have
a division of assets.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.874
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

37:22.908 --> 37:25.110
Yeah. I'll pick up the kids
before your classes.

37:25.143 --> 37:28.580
Okay. Hey, Toby. Wait.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.082
Look, Kate, we don't need to
make a big thing out of this.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.718
It's really, really hot out,
I gotta get to work,

37:32.751 --> 37:34.119
and I'm just,
I'm really, really tired.

37:34.152 --> 37:36.822
I know. Just, please,
let me say one thing.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.660
This is not how our story ends.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.995
Just because our marriage
is over,

37:44.029 --> 37:45.531
doesn't mean our story's over.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.013
You can just put everything
in that corner.

38:10.556 --> 38:14.426
So, I got all the same furniture
as in his other room.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.529
I tried to match the layout
as best as possible,

38:17.563 --> 38:19.130
so it's easier
for him to navigate.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.771
The slime is hungry
for children!

38:28.239 --> 38:31.109
What if we drip some
on your shoe?

38:31.142 --> 38:33.345
No? You don't want to get messy?

38:33.379 --> 38:36.214
-I know who it is. Hi!

38:36.247 --> 38:39.050
Hi, Jack.
Hi, sweet girl.

38:39.084 --> 38:42.053
-Yay!
-Hey, there.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.955
-Hiya, guys.
-Watch out!
Coming through!

38:43.989 --> 38:46.392
-Coming through!
-What are you guys
having for dinner?

38:46.425 --> 38:48.794
-Hey, guys, what are we
having for dinner?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.195
Can I interest you?

38:50.228 --> 38:54.299
Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.301
All right. I'll have dinner
with you guys.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.256
-Good job!

39:23.429 --> 39:24.663
-Oh.
-Sorry.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.864
Um, sorry.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.699
It's okay.

39:27.733 --> 39:28.934
Well...

39:28.967 --> 39:30.436
Well, isn't this just parfait.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.073
Like perfect.
It was a joke. Sorry.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.676
Come on. It's-it's okay.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.078
It was a cute joke.
Yeah, it was just...

39:40.111 --> 39:41.112
yeah, it was just
a little vanilla.

39:45.784 --> 39:48.053
That was good. I liked it.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.721
-Thank you.
-Hi, I'm Toby.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.200
-Oh, hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, Mom.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.235
I can't wait to
hear you play later.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.171
Hey, buddy.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.910
You're both here.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.138
This is not how our story ends.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.775
Just because
our marriage is over,

40:43.809 --> 40:45.977
doesn't mean our story's over.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.946
I mean, we were meant
to find each other

40:47.979 --> 40:48.780
in that weight loss group.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.150
We were meant to be together.

40:52.183 --> 40:56.287
And now...
we're meant to be apart.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.526
And I know that one day
you will see it.

41:06.965 --> 41:11.302
Kate, I promise you...

41:11.336 --> 41:13.639
I will never see it.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.729
Kate, do-do you remember

41:37.763 --> 41:41.466
what you said to me the day
we signed our divorce papers?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.168
Yeah, I remember.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.338
I want you to know...

41:47.372 --> 41:49.174
that I see it now.
