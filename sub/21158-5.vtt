I just don't know what's happening to me.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.480
-You don't?
-No.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.920
I've never been attracted to a woman.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.040
I'd never even thought about it.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.120
<i>♪ Hush, baby ♪</i>

13:05.480 --> 13:06.920
That's how we're brought up...

13:08.680 --> 13:11.000
to not even think
that we have that option.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.720
Do you know how many years
I thought I was sick,

13:18.120 --> 13:22.040
that what I felt was a sin,
that it went against nature?

13:23.560 --> 13:25.240
Too many, Carlota.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.520
It doesn't go against anything.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.120
<i>♪ Hush, baby ♪</i>

13:29.200 --> 13:31.800
Something so beautiful can't be wrong,
no matter what they say.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.680
I know you think your life
as you know it is in danger.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.960
And maybe you're right, but...

13:39.040 --> 13:41.240
you're not risking it
for something insignificant.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.320
At least, not as far as I'm concerned.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.240
Hello! On the stairs again.
What a coincidence.

14:05.320 --> 14:07.480
If you want to think that, go ahead.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.120
-Does that mean it's time for a kiss?
-Take this.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.200
What's this for?

14:13.280 --> 14:14.480
[chuckles]

14:18.440 --> 14:20.560
-[whispers] It's my savings.
-[both chuckle]

14:20.640 --> 14:22.800
100 pesetas?
Are you implying that we don't pay much?

14:22.880 --> 14:26.400
I want to invest in your project.
Consider it an investment.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.360
[both chuckle]

14:28.440 --> 14:31.240
I know it's not much,
but you have to start somewhere.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.120
Don't laugh! [laughs]

14:35.040 --> 14:37.960
It was hard for me to come by,
and now it's all in your hands.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.800
-I have this urge to kiss you.
-[laughs]

14:42.880 --> 14:44.960
That'd make people talk, don't you think?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.400
[clicks tongue]
We'll have to wait till tonight.

14:48.880 --> 14:54.080
[whispering] Or... we can go see how...
my investment is coming along.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.440
I'm sure it's in an out-of-the-way place.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.120
Fine, let's meet in the machine room
a little later.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.800
I have a meeting right now.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.040
Well, suit yourself.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.200
-[scoffs]
-[chuckles]

15:21.440 --> 15:23.320
Forgive the delay.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.920
[Ricardo] It'd be a surprise
if you arrived on time.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.480
Father, if you want to continue
yesterday's quarrel, it's fine by me.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.640
-Carlos--
-No, it's all right.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.560
The cards are on the table.
We made everything clear.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.280
There's no need to pretend now.

15:37.360 --> 15:41.800
No, now we'll have to sort out
the problems you caused.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.440
Those responsible
for His Majesty's call have been fired.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.080
I took care of it personally
and sent a letter of apology.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.520
-Good.
-You think that's good?

15:52.120 --> 15:56.000
I always think it's good
when my son acts like a man.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.880
[chuckles] Very well.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.320
But it's not enough.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.200
The king is angry.
And when he's angry, Villalba is, too.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.400
And that causes problems for us.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.440
He still hasn't signed off
on the fee increase.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.120
-Do you think he'll back out?
-Over a joke? That'd be ridiculous.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.200
But possible.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.880
Luckily, we have the government delegate
on our side.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.040
Villalba has always interceded
on our behalf with His Majesty.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.840
Let's invite him to dinner.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.240
An intelligent businessman--

16:25.320 --> 16:27.800
Does what is expected
while preparing for the unexpected.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.600
[chuckles] I couldn't have said it better.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.680
-[chuckles]
-I want you at that dinner.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.280
I'll ask Carolina to call Villalba.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.400
Good, I'll organize it all
after I make some important calls.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.960
Good. Thank you.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.160
Operator 48. Number please.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.960
<i>Hi, blondie. Madrid 239, please.</i>

17:08.040 --> 17:09.359
Yes, one moment, Carolina.

17:16.839 --> 17:17.839
Yes, Carolina?

17:17.920 --> 17:22.000
[Carolina] <i>Doña Elisa, I know you told me</i>
<i>to forget the operator,</i>

17:22.720 --> 17:23.800
but it was her.

17:24.839 --> 17:25.920
Lidia is Alba.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.680
<i>I found a letter in a suitcase</i>
<i>addressed to her.</i>

17:30.160 --> 17:31.680
A suitcase with a letter.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.840
What does it say?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.360
<i>It literally says,</i>

17:37.440 --> 17:39.400
<i>"I will always love you, Alba."</i>

17:40.680 --> 17:42.040
I told you.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.480
Lidia is your husband's lover.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.200
<i>Doña Elisa?</i>

17:51.000 --> 17:52.080
Bring me that letter.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.800
<i>Yes, of course. I can't right now,</i>
<i>but I'll come at lunchtime.</i>

17:55.880 --> 17:57.200
[Elisa hangs up phone]

17:59.560 --> 18:01.160
[sighs]

18:05.320 --> 18:07.560
What's wrong? You look down.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.240
-[Miguel] Women.
-Women, God's finest work.

18:10.320 --> 18:13.320
It's a pity they don't come
with instructions, like machines.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.760
-[chuckles]
-It'd all be much simpler.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.280
May I?

18:24.600 --> 18:25.720
ROTARY 7 PROJECT

18:25.800 --> 18:27.640
Relax, we can trust her.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.160
-Sorry, but I don't see why she's here.
-[Carlos] What's this about?

18:31.240 --> 18:34.120
You tell me not to tell anyone,
and you tell your new... Never mind.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.480
Isn't my word enough?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.840
If the bosses find out, I'll be fired.
You're the owner's son, you'll be fine.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.560
If that happens,
I'll be out on the street, too.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.960
-I put money into this project.
-One hundred pesetas.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.680
You think that's enough
for the copper we need?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.680
[Carlos] I'll get the rest.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.400
I see. You handle the investors,
and I'm just the skilled labor.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.400
I'm going for a coffee with brandy.
Or two.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.800
-Miguel...
-Never mind. Don't worry about me.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.480
-[chuckles]
-He'll get over it.

19:06.720 --> 19:08.840
He's a libertarian.
He thinks I don't know him,

19:08.920 --> 19:11.360
but he likes anything
to do with defying authority.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.760
Speaking of things people like...

19:16.520 --> 19:19.200
I'm sure it's all going to turn out fine.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.240
Your faith is my greatest incentive.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.240
[chuckles]

19:23.320 --> 19:25.640
Well, and this, too. [chuckles]

19:25.720 --> 19:26.760
Do you know what?

19:27.680 --> 19:30.040
I think I know where to get the copper.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.440
-Where?
-[both chuckle]

19:31.520 --> 19:32.640
Listen to me.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
From here.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.400
You're suggesting
that I steal from my own family?

19:41.480 --> 19:45.440
No. I don't see it as stealing.
It's more like...

19:45.520 --> 19:47.240
-an advance.
-Right.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.400
I think you and my father
have different ideas about family.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.160
[sighs]

19:58.120 --> 19:59.640
Besides, after yesterday...

20:01.920 --> 20:04.480
I don't think it's the right time
to push his limits.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.600
He's still annoyed about the party?

20:07.640 --> 20:11.800
I think it's the most respect
he's shown me in the past 15 years.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.760
Maybe it's as simple as that...

20:19.760 --> 20:20.840
standing up to him.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.560
Try it out.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.520
It's time.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.600
Just out of curiosity...

20:29.880 --> 20:32.520
how could we get the copper
without anyone finding out?

20:37.400 --> 20:39.600
Carlota doesn't know about this.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.840
I won't tell her,
if that's what worries you.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.400
Do you know what that machine is?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.600
-Do you know what we're building?
-Yes.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.800
And you don't care?

20:49.520 --> 20:53.560
You don't care if you lose your job,
if your friends lose their jobs?

20:53.640 --> 20:56.320
I could ask you the same thing,
don't you think?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.000
I've been working on this for years.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.400
My dreams are at stake. What's at stake
for you? What are you after?

21:02.440 --> 21:03.480
[scoffs]

21:03.560 --> 21:06.440
I imagine you'd rather be
the girlfriend of a communications magnate

21:06.520 --> 21:07.840
than a simple operator.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.680
-Not everyone's like Carlota.
-You're not either.

21:12.760 --> 21:16.920
Neither of us has her integrity or purity.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.720
That's what we like about her.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.360
So I think it's better
if we both keep this little secret.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.120
After all, I am your partner.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.200
I'm on your side.

21:37.160 --> 21:41.600
Lidia, honey, won't the engineer
pose a problem for your plan?

21:41.680 --> 21:45.400
No. Miguel is lying to Carlota.
He's got a lot to lose.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.880
<i>So do you, princess.</i>

21:46.960 --> 21:49.880
<i>When the girls find out</i>
<i>that they're going to lose their jobs</i>

21:49.960 --> 21:51.880
<i>and that you knew about it...</i>

21:51.960 --> 21:55.040
They won't find out.
The girls won't lose anything.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.000
I'll steal the rotary blueprints
before the company can build it.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.800
Good.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.600
And... what's next?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.520
Gain their trust.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.840
I'll help them get the copper.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.920
Some copper's been stolen in Talavera,
and we have to fix the line urgently.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.960
-We can't wait for the usual paperwork--
-Come here.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.280
Excuse me.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.720
I have to tell you something.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.880
It's about Carolina.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.560
You're saying she has a letter.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.200
A letter addressed to you...

22:35.080 --> 22:36.280
I mean, to Alba.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.600
Are you going to explain,
or should I give you my theory?

22:54.400 --> 22:55.680
All right.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.880
It's true.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.360
My real name is Alba.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.080
I changed it to be able to work here.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.400
Francisco was the love of my youth.

23:08.240 --> 23:11.520
I hadn't seen him for ten years.
There's nothing between us now.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.880
All right. I believe you.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.480
But his wife thinks you're his lover,

23:20.560 --> 23:23.120
and Carolina's going to give her a letter
that confirms it.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.560
Francisco doesn't deserve this.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.120
I wouldn't trust Francisco that much.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.160
He's got a dark side.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.200
The Cifuentes family is using the company
as a source of information.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.520
Are you implying
that they spy on their customers?

23:38.600 --> 23:41.680
I'm not implying it.
I'm saying that they do it.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.160
He and the Cifuentes family
are the same breed as my father.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.720
Or worse. I know the type.

23:45.800 --> 23:49.080
No, I don't think
Francisco is in on all of this.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.640
Well, he is.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.760
A person can change a lot in ten years.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.680
I have to get that letter back.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.720
Very well. I'll leave it on his desk now.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.080
You won't find anything there.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.800
I knew you went into my room.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.600
You see, we're the same.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.160
You mean jumping into bed
with married men?

24:36.240 --> 24:38.080
[scoffs] I'm not like that.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.960
Tell that to Doña Elisa, not me.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.440
You're finished.

24:43.520 --> 24:47.000
And I wouldn't bother trying to talk
to Francisco. He's not here.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.440
What happened?

24:56.520 --> 24:58.960
She found it and has it well hidden.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.440
Now what?

25:03.920 --> 25:07.560
I have to find Francisco
and tell him as soon as possible.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.600
Where were you, Lidia?
There were two breakdowns.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.440
Taking care of... an issue.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.480
If you're going to step out...

25:15.560 --> 25:17.200
[breathing heavily]

25:21.040 --> 25:23.560

26:11.560 --> 26:13.000
My wife? What's wrong?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.120
What's going on?

26:18.320 --> 26:21.680
<i>♪ Who's the one to blame... ♪</i>

26:22.560 --> 26:24.560
-Ángeles!
-The doctor said to wait.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.000
-She's my wife.
-Mario, calm down.

26:27.080 --> 26:27.960
Let me--

26:28.040 --> 26:30.200
Listen to me
if you want what's best for your wife.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.000
You'll just be a nuisance inside.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.160
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.120
-If you want a glass of water--
-No, let me speak.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.880
I'm Operator 57,
the one who you've been talking to,

27:01.960 --> 27:04.640
and also the one who said that I,
Operator 47, had gone home.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.240
If I get muddled, tell me.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.480
It's okay if you don't talk to me,
Don Pablo. Sorry to call you that.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.080
In person, I get embarrassed.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.240
Would I understand
if you refused to talk to me?

27:14.320 --> 27:17.200
Yes. Of course, it would hurt,
but I'd understand.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.240
Entirely.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.320
-It's the letter I sent you.
-Yes.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.880
When I tell my grandma,
she'll call me a nitwit.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.360
I always knew it was you.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.280
I didn't say anything
because I respected your decision and...

27:37.360 --> 27:38.360
well...

27:39.240 --> 27:43.320
I wanted to give you time
to find out for yourself...

27:45.600 --> 27:47.840
that you don't need to hide
behind anyone else.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.560
Operator 47 or 57...

27:55.520 --> 27:57.240
to me, you were always you.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.080
How is my wife?

28:09.160 --> 28:11.840
[doctor] I'm afraid
she's had a miscarriage.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.400
My wife wasn't pregnant.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.480
She was three or four months along.

28:15.560 --> 28:21.320
She has other injuries in her abdomen
and uterus from the fall she had.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.040
That is what caused the miscarriage.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.680
Can we go in and see her?

28:46.480 --> 28:48.680
[footsteps approaching]

28:54.000 --> 28:56.080
What a fright you gave us, Ángel--

28:59.080 --> 29:00.440
Ángeles...

29:02.760 --> 29:04.040
I saw your injuries.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.360
Mario did it, didn't he?

29:11.320 --> 29:14.280
Why keep quiet? Stop protecting him.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.520
I'm afraid.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.240
But not of him. I'm afraid of myself.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.840
[Alba] Why do you say that?

29:27.200 --> 29:30.360
I didn't do enough
to stop him from hitting me...

29:31.480 --> 29:33.840
because deep down,
I wanted to lose the baby.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.120
None of this is your fault.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.080
You could only protect yourself.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.040
Sure...

29:46.040 --> 29:48.760
We have to get her out of here
as soon as possible

29:48.840 --> 29:50.160
and away from that animal.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.520
I'm going out. Tell the Cifuenteses
I'll be back in an hour.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.080
Mario, what are you doing here?

30:14.160 --> 30:16.120
Ángeles lost the baby because of me.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.840
I didn't know she was pregnant.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.440
I swear. I didn't know.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.960
-Honey, I told you, remember?
-She told me she wasn't.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.760
But it was an accident, right?

30:35.800 --> 30:38.000
You don't get it!

30:38.080 --> 30:40.120
I killed my own child!

30:40.200 --> 30:43.360
What kind of man kills his own child?

30:43.440 --> 30:45.720
-Calm down, please.
-Who? Who does that?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.560
-It's all your fault.
-I didn't do anything.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.400
-Go! Get out of here!
-I had nothing to do with it!

30:52.480 --> 30:55.040
-Don't touch me!
-I never want to see you again! You hear?

30:55.120 --> 30:56.360
Never!

31:06.720 --> 31:08.560
I don't know if it's a good idea.

31:08.640 --> 31:12.000
You can't go back to him, Ángeles.
Not after this.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.000
Besides, it's the supervisor's orders.
She's the boss.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.640
[Marga] What do we tell Mario?

31:18.400 --> 31:21.720
[Alba] That she's gone home.
You'll have time before he leaves.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.360
I'll go get help.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.600
Lidia, you'd better stay.
You have matters to attend to.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.600
-Are you sure? Ángeles isn't well.
-Yes, don't worry.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.400
-How are you?
-Better, thanks.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.960
They're taking her home.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.880
-If you need one of the cars--
-No, thanks. We'll see to it.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.400
Let's go.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.480
Thank you.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.840
Don Francisco, we have to talk about--

31:49.920 --> 31:51.440
Sorry, I'm busy.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.440
What are you doing?

32:08.280 --> 32:10.040
Talking to you. We have a problem.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.040
You and I don't have much more to say.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.440
You wrote me a note.
There was a letter in the suitcase.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.600
You know I did.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.160
What did it say?

32:25.080 --> 32:28.280
[chuckles] You humiliated me
and now you want to make a fool of me.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.680
You want me to tell you I love you
so you can reject me?

32:30.760 --> 32:33.920
-I'm not humiliating you.
-Sorry, I don't believe you this time.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.040
You know what?

32:37.120 --> 32:40.520
Yes, I'm a liar. But so are you.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.040
Do you know
what the only difference between us is?

32:44.040 --> 32:45.440
At least I admit it.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
[scoffs]

32:47.760 --> 32:49.560
-I'm not a liar.
-Really?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.280
What about your wife?

32:52.400 --> 32:56.720
How did you get this job? Was it legal?

32:56.800 --> 32:58.760
I'm not going to let you insult me.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.280
Carolina has the letter.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.560
She's going to give it to your wife.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.120
That's why I'm here. Not to insult you.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.280
What?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.680
[sighs] I didn't read it.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.800
She came into my room
when I was out and took it.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.280
This can't be happening.

33:25.360 --> 33:28.400
With what happened to Ángeles,
I had no time to tell you.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.520
I don't even know
if she's already given it to her.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.600
-[sighs]
-Where are you going?

33:37.600 --> 33:39.880
To try and stop Elisa
from finding out about this.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.880
I think I have the solution.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.000
How long will you keep up this attitude?

33:47.080 --> 33:50.120
Yesterday, you didn't let me explain,
and today you're avoiding me.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.920
Is it really going to end like this?

33:55.040 --> 33:56.080
Over a kiss?

33:57.440 --> 34:01.680
Carlota, I don't care if you kiss Sara,
or anyone else. I don't care.

34:01.760 --> 34:05.080
I love you just the way you are.
Free, unpredictable.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.760
I don't want you to change.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.600
All right, then...

34:09.840 --> 34:11.520
what's the problem?

34:17.560 --> 34:19.320
I know what you mean to me.

34:20.239 --> 34:22.400
I don't know what I mean to you.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.719
You said yourself that you don't know.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.639
So figure it out,
for the good of everyone,

34:28.719 --> 34:31.199
and then do me a favor and tell me.

Hello.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.880
[Carlos] What are you doing here?

34:47.560 --> 34:49.840
Visiting you.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.600
I'm lucky Francisco isn't here.

34:52.560 --> 34:54.560
I saw him go out.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.280
You know what?

35:00.640 --> 35:04.520
I could tell you about a dream I had
in which you looked this handsome,

35:05.800 --> 35:09.680
but I'd have to tell you the end,
and I'm afraid you'll be scandalized.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.640
Well... try me.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.120
Why don't we do it in real life?

35:16.360 --> 35:19.320
Tonight. You...

35:21.000 --> 35:22.400
and me.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.880
[sighs heavily]

35:24.600 --> 35:25.520
I didn't tell you.

35:25.600 --> 35:30.000
Regrettably, we can't today.
I have a commitment.

35:30.080 --> 35:34.440
A dinner with the government delegate
to apologize for the palace prank.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.560
You get all dressed up for that man,
and not for me.

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
Lidia...

35:40.640 --> 35:44.200
No, the government delegate
is a very lucky man.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.640
I'd like to have dinner with you tonight.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.560
Maybe to get around
to what we keep leaving unfinished.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.720
Good afternoon. You have a call
from Madrid 182. Connecting you.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.920
[man 1] <i>It's me.</i>
<i>I've talked to several generals,</i>

36:37.000 --> 36:39.320
<i>and most of the army would be with us.</i>

36:39.400 --> 36:43.400
The prime minister broke his promise
by disbanding the artillery corps,

36:43.480 --> 36:44.600
and they won't forgive that.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.560

<i>Another republic can't be worse</i>
<i>than this misrule.</i>

36:52.280 --> 36:54.400
[man 2] We have to know
if the conservatives are with us.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.640
[man 1] They'd better be.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.760
The coup is happening,
with or without them.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.760
We will not go on like this.
Let the Falcon know.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.520
Take care of Elisa. I'll deal with Carlos.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.720
All right.

37:12.800 --> 37:16.360
Don Francisco! Wait! I have news.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.800
-Tell me tomorrow. Tomorrow.
-But, please...

37:20.720 --> 37:22.600
This will cause trouble for us.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.280
If her husband finds out she's here,
he'll kick up a real stink.

37:25.360 --> 37:28.360
Lola, calm down.
Nobody knows she's here.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.320
Besides, Miss Kent is a lawyer
and can be trusted.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.120
There are women lawyers?

37:33.200 --> 37:34.760
Sure, she's the first in Spain.

37:34.840 --> 37:36.960
I don't want to know anything about this!

37:40.720 --> 37:41.560
Tea?

37:41.640 --> 37:45.520
Thanks. Though I suppose
Carlota didn't invite me here for tea.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.520
No. We want to know
if there's a legal premise

37:48.600 --> 37:50.920
that would help my friend
divorce her husband.

37:51.640 --> 37:55.240
Unfortunately, and despite
our struggle against it,

37:55.320 --> 38:00.200
marriage is still regulated by Article 52
of the 1889 Civil Code.

38:00.720 --> 38:01.960
What does that mean?

38:02.040 --> 38:05.360
That there's only one cause
for the dissolution of a marriage:

38:06.080 --> 38:07.640
the death of a spouse.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.760
So... unless she does away
with her husband...

38:13.480 --> 38:15.560
-Excuse me?
-It's an option.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.720
[Carlota] But he beat her up.
Doesn't that change the legal premise?

38:18.800 --> 38:20.000
I'm sorry.

38:20.680 --> 38:24.880
Look, you can go to the police
and report it if you have proof.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.600
Otherwise,
they'll lock you up for perjury.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.480
-What kind of world are we living in?
-One that has to change.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.720
-What are we going to do?
-I have to go home.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.160
Go home? You can't!
He can't get away with it!

38:40.240 --> 38:42.800
You heard Miss Kent.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.600
The alternative is jail.

38:45.800 --> 38:49.560
Not everyone has an understanding,
modern man like you, Carlota.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.520
Or an attentive suitor.
Life isn't always fair.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.200
[Miss Kent] Even less so for women.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.920

-You're in front of the servants.

39:21.920 --> 39:26.240
I don't care about the servants!
I don't care about the servants!

39:26.320 --> 39:28.920
You said it was in the past,
that there was nothing between you!

39:29.000 --> 39:31.680
-Why did she have this letter?
-Who? Stop. Stop.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.920
-[maid] Madam.
-What?

39:34.080 --> 39:36.040
Miss Lidia Aguilar is here.

39:36.120 --> 39:39.760
And you have the gall to bring her here?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.680
-Never touch me again!
-What's going on here?

39:42.760 --> 39:44.960
Let him tell you!

39:45.040 --> 39:48.040
-He's shameless and an adulterer!
-Elisa...

39:48.120 --> 39:52.280
[sobs] And you?
How could you show your face here?

39:52.360 --> 39:55.440
Get out of my house! Have you no shame?

39:55.520 --> 39:59.600
Control yourself
and tell me what's going on.

39:59.680 --> 40:03.160
She... is Francisco's lover!

40:05.280 --> 40:07.840
She has nothing to do with Francisco.
She's my girlfriend.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.600
Mother, let me introduce you to Lidia.
I wanted you to meet her.

40:14.040 --> 40:17.240
Here, it'll do you good.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.960
You must forgive my daughter.
She's having problems with her nerves.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.960
Don't try to justify her actions.
It was an embarrassing spectacle.

40:25.040 --> 40:28.440
We must take measures
to see this does not happen again.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.960
Imagine if the mayor were here.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.000
You're always looking out
for the good of the family, Father.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.920
When were you going to tell us
you were settling down

40:38.000 --> 40:40.160
and in a formal relationship?

40:40.240 --> 40:42.560
-It's serious this time, isn't it?
-[chuckles]

40:42.640 --> 40:43.840
We shall see.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.920
It's nothing personal, just his record.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.360
As for my daughter,

40:51.440 --> 40:54.720
she may have stopped taking
her medication. She's done it before.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.760
Yes, but I don't understand
why she took it out on Lidia.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.080
Do you know each other?

41:01.560 --> 41:04.000
-No.
-And my son-in-law?

41:05.040 --> 41:06.800
I've seen him in the company.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.160
Sure. In the company. Of course.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.400
This was all Carolina's fault.

41:19.600 --> 41:23.080
She made me believe
that Lidia was his lover. I'm sorry.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.360
-[Carlos] The secretary?
-[Francisco] Yes, her.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.040
This unpleasant matter will be settled
tomorrow.

41:29.360 --> 41:33.040
[Carlos] Hold on. The secretary?
Carolina? Why?

41:34.360 --> 41:38.520
We've never gotten along.
She thinks I want her job.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.560
But accusing me of something like this...

41:41.320 --> 41:44.920
I asked her to watch Francisco
because he was acting strangely.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.200
[Carmen] That's enough.
No need to go into details, darling.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.440
[Ricardo] We'll talk later.

41:50.800 --> 41:54.240
[inhales sharply] Excuse me,
I need to go to the ladies' room.

I'm going to the Lyceum.
I have things to do.

42:06.520 --> 42:09.640
I'm going that way.
I have things to do, too. Bye.

42:09.720 --> 42:10.640
Bye.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.920
-Give my best to Pablo.
-I will.

And you know what?
We will never get that right.

42:44.720 --> 42:47.400
We'll never get it if we don't stand up
and fight for it.

42:47.480 --> 42:50.720

42:50.800 --> 42:53.840
I don't understand how you let Ángeles
go back home to that animal.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.280
We had no choice. The law is on his side.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.800
Men make the laws for themselves.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.280

43:05.240 --> 43:08.760

43:11.160 --> 43:14.040

I've been with him.
