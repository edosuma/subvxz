WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:07.507
I’m so excited to see who’s
the new charter guests.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.134
[wolf whistle]

00:09.175 --> 00:10.885
Hi, nice to meet you.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.762
I’m Kyle, nice to meet you.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.724
Holy hell, Lord save me.

00:18.643 --> 00:21.021
We have our limitations.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.105
Okay, what’s the goss, sis?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.440
And one of those big limitations

00:23.481 --> 00:25.775
is do not ever
get intimate with guests.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.235
Kyle is such a flirt.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.195
He’s just sitting
out there, isn’t he?

00:29.237 --> 00:30.530
I guess someone’s gotta do it.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.951
Long-distance relationships
in yachting

00:34.993 --> 00:36.453
almost seems impossible.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.913
I’m not gonna lie,
it’s very distracting.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.832
So, just putting in tonight
you want me to do...

00:40.874 --> 00:43.251
One second, because
this is quite urgent.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.090
You don’t know what you want.

00:50.508 --> 00:53.678
Luckily, I just need
to do the food.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.055
Opa.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.724
Jason, we need a secondary
line, it’s too windy.

00:57.766 --> 00:58.808
Jason!

00:58.850 --> 01:00.060
[whistles]

01:00.101 --> 01:01.311
He’s just flat-out ignoring me.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.854
I think I have a
problem with authority

01:02.896 --> 01:04.272
when I think that they’re
100 percent wrong.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.691
-What did you tie it?
-It’s a bowline.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.777
If you wanna do a bowline,
you must do a proper bowline.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.699
I wanna put it all on the
table at the same time.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.662
Do you want me to just
do one at a time, then?

01:20.789 --> 01:24.000
So this is
the pinot grigio 2020.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.919
[bleep]

01:25.960 --> 01:28.421
The wine-pairing slowed down
the service so much.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.799
I’m reheating multiple dishes.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.467
-Wow.
-Thank you.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.720
Oh, I thought that was
the bao buns.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.097
It’s out of order now, though.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.515
-What country is this?
-America.

01:38.556 --> 01:39.891
We need to simplify it, babe.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.518
We don’t have the
staff capability.

01:41.559 --> 01:43.061
We couldn’t have done
wine-pairing otherwise.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.313
The last thing you wanna do
is just have a service

01:45.355 --> 01:46.731
that does not seem seamless.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.734
It’s a lot to deal
with between two people.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.152
Brace a bitch.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.656
This is insane.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.926
What have we got here?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.678
Mushroom-truffle bao buns.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.851
-Yeah.
-We’re in China now.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.895
We’ve got bao buns with glazed
wild mushroom and black truffle.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.857
It has got a meaty undertone,
but everything’s vegetarian.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.191
It’s really good.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.070
We need to get
seven more wine glasses.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.488
Oh, my God.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.207
Coming, Dave.

02:48.043 --> 02:52.380
So, this is the Vasse Felix from
Margaret River, cab sav, 2015.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.674
Gotcha, gotcha.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.969
This one has notes
of red currant.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.971
And this is which country?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.432
-England!
-Yeah!

03:02.474 --> 03:03.975
-Fish and chips.
-Thank you.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.101
Can I get a vodka soda?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.686
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.523
Of course.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.983
And what do I need to get?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.234
I need you to get ginger ale
from the sun deck.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.778
No, I can grab that.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.071
Yeah, I’ve got your vodka...
your tequila coming up.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.864
How does she want vodka soda,

03:17.906 --> 03:20.075
she’s got, like, 10 wines
set in front of her?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.076
She doesn’t like wine.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.619
Are they happy with it?

03:22.660 --> 03:23.828
Yeah, they’re all wine-pairing,
they’re happy.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.621
Yeah.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.914
Dessert’s served, guys.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.707
The guest are loving it,
but the problem is

03:27.749 --> 03:30.418
I had everything ready
to go up at once,

03:30.460 --> 03:32.587
and then the guys
doing service

03:32.629 --> 03:35.173
could have just poured
whatever wine they wanted.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.093
I’m trying to make
the interior’s life easier.

03:38.134 --> 03:41.471
But a wine-pairing is making
everyone else’s life difficult.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.598
So, for your last course
of the evening,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.393
we’re going to pair it with
Graham’s fine ruby port.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.812
-Oh!
-There’s more?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.063
The last.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.064
The gelato’s dairy-free?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.273
Everything’s dairy-free.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.733
-Oh, okay.
-Amazing.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.984
He’s a blessing.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.778
Well, that was sh--.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.367
I hated it.
I hate everything.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.535
I can see so.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.953
-Hey, guys, how was the food?
-Lovely.

04:04.994 --> 04:05.995
-Super good.
-So good.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.914
I’m so full.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.207
Yes!

04:09.249 --> 04:11.126
Adam requests for
a water obstacle course

04:11.167 --> 04:12.794
for a friendly competition.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.295
Cool.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.260
See you later.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.470
I’m gonna go change into,
like, not this.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.764
-Yeah, I wanna change too.
-Like, into PJs.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.016
Let it hang.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.517
Wait, you guys should
also change into PJs.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.601
-No underwear.
-Babe.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.353
No, they must be
fully uniformed.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.230
Honestly, I have
to listen to the primary,

04:32.272 --> 04:33.273
and so, I will do so.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.566
Yay!

04:34.607 --> 04:35.608
Actually, I’ll get
these glasses,

04:35.650 --> 04:36.651
and then I’m done.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.111
-Perfect.
-Yeah.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.447
That was great, and I’m so full.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.743
That was a hectic service, eh?

04:44.784 --> 04:47.495
But it was, like,
boom, boom, boom.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.748
It wasn’t, it was sh--.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.962
I feel like it was maybe
slightly the wrong decision

04:56.004 --> 04:59.632
to do wine-pairing, because
the service was so hectic.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.968
But the guests
are having the best time.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.428
That’s all that matters.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.221
Oh, Liam, this feels expensive.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.639
-Yeah.
-No, it’s from Amazon.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.308
I’m also gonna change now.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.809
And get your pajamas on?

05:09.851 --> 05:11.019
Yeah.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.272
-Are you not playing with us?
-Oh, my God.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.149
Tomorrow night I’ll join...
tomorrow night I’ll join in.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.485
-Yes, we’ll do.
-Tomorrow night I’ll join again.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.778
And I’ll make my [bleep]...

05:19.819 --> 05:22.072
-It’s not very physical.
-Have fun, guys.

05:24.199 --> 05:25.867
All right, au revoir.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.923
-Wow!
-Yes!

05:41.174 --> 05:42.967
Wait, I need a photo of this.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.302
Yes.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.762
Aw!

05:45.804 --> 05:47.305
-Shall we have a group photo?
-You look so good.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.057
Yes, yes, yes!

05:49.099 --> 05:52.018
Oh, okay, I’ll take one now, and
then I’ll take another after.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.353
You look so happy, guys.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.438
It’s a PJ party, it’s a theme,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.190
we have themes
every night on boats.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.901
Let’s go inside, I’m done.
I’m done with the wind.

05:59.943 --> 06:02.278
I think that Kyle’s flirting,
it’s great.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.905
I love a good love story.

06:03.947 --> 06:08.868
I’ve always been, like,
this rebellious angel.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.538
People think I look
all sweet and innocent,

06:11.579 --> 06:15.208
but really, I try to
get away with murder.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.043
I’ve let my hair down.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.463
For me, bad decisions
make good stories.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.673
Let’s have a toast.

06:21.715 --> 06:22.924
Can we do the rose and
the thorn?

06:22.966 --> 06:24.551
-Let’s do rose and thorn.
-Yay!

06:24.592 --> 06:25.719
Okay, so, rose and thorn...

06:25.760 --> 06:26.761
what was the highlight,
the rose,

06:26.803 --> 06:28.096
the beautiful thing for you;

06:28.138 --> 06:29.764
what was the thorn,
something that was,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.391
uh, sh-- for you, or could
have improved for you?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.477
First of all, meeting all
of you was for sure the rose,

06:34.519 --> 06:35.770
not even a question.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.856
-Absolutely lovely people.
-Oh, my God.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.735
A thorn was biting my lip when
I went backwards off the slide.

06:41.776 --> 06:45.155
-Okay, Kyle!
-Frankie.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.033
I never thought I would
honestly be so attracted

06:48.074 --> 06:50.410
to another individual
in a long while.

06:50.452 --> 06:51.786
Wow.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.080
And I saw your smile,
I was, like, shook.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.874
He has this calming aura.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.876
When I feel I’m around him,
it keeps me very grounded

06:57.917 --> 06:59.919
and secure, and I,
like, feel that energy,

06:59.961 --> 07:02.088
I wanna be around it and
get to know you more.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.089
Oh!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.134
I could definitely be fired

07:06.176 --> 07:07.635
if I’m not careful
about this interaction.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.139
But being part of
the LGBTQIA+ community,

07:11.181 --> 07:14.559
it is very difficult to try
and find a true connection.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.561
What’s more important,
job or romance?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.188
That’s what’s
running through my mind.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.484
Cheers to the queers.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.282
You know what, if you
wanna stay in the circle,

07:29.324 --> 07:31.326
you better stay in the circle.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.369
Wow.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.204
Your ----ing eyes.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.457
Because...

07:37.499 --> 07:40.210
-Ah!
-Woo!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.129
-Your doing so well.
-Yeah.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.589
He’s fine.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.049
Oh, my God, shut up,
I’m, like, really...

07:46.091 --> 07:47.425
I’m really...

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
If Sandy comes out right now
and catches this moment

07:50.512 --> 07:54.182
of what’s going on, like, we’re
both in a lot of trouble here.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.603
As his boss, I should be
saying something to stop this,

07:58.645 --> 08:02.399
but I feel like a bit of
a cock-block right now.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.025
You need?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.986
Please, I just need to just
do some work thing real quick.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.196
Okay.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.537
I don’t want us to get
into trouble, though, for being,

08:15.578 --> 08:17.497
like, too over-familiar,
do you know what I mean?

08:17.539 --> 08:19.541
Yeah.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.378
Good night, beautiful people.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.963
-Sweet dreams, guys.
-We’ll see you in the morning.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.589
-Bye, love.
-Sleep well.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.550
-All right.
-Sweet dreams.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.095
I’ve still not wiped
down the bar areas up there.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.683
What a mess.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.685
Oh, my God.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.689
What’s going on here?

08:45.442 --> 08:48.069
-Morning.
-Yeah.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.654
My God.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.156
What do you mean,
we had a good night.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.993
So, obviously,
I was very uncomfortable,

08:55.035 --> 08:57.871
but I’ll do anything
for the guests.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.040
I like your commitment
to the cause.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.042
Yeah, when that
tip comes through

09:02.083 --> 09:03.960
and it’s one of the highest,

09:04.002 --> 09:05.712
I want you all to look my way.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.464
That’s what I’m saying.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.050
-You going to bed now?
-Yeah.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.218
Sweet dreams, hey?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.220
Okay, bedtime.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.617
Guys?

09:39.954 --> 09:41.206
Don’t hit the ski.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.958
Yee-Ooh!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.960
Great job, thanks, Court.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.722
[snoring]

09:59.432 --> 10:01.059
Oh...

10:01.101 --> 10:02.936
So, my name is Taylor, and
I’m from Durban, South Africa.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.646
I’m not sure if you’ve
heard about it,

10:04.688 --> 10:07.691
but I’ve been in yachting for,
like, two to three years now.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.401
-That’s pretty good.
-It’s...

10:09.442 --> 10:11.277
you know, it’s pretty good,
but I’m just really in it

10:11.319 --> 10:13.530
for the money, you know,
because it’s such

10:13.571 --> 10:15.782
a good difference to the rand.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.659
You gotta add a couple
more "Lakks" in there.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.660
-Yeah.
-L-A-A-K, yeah.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.911
-Laak.
-Laak.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.579
What time they go to bed?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.997
They go to bed at the same time
as you, or were they still up?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.457
I don’t know what they did.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.377
All I saw was Kyle in pajamas.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.005
I kinda get bothered,
because the boat is dirty.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.009
There are morning duties.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.428
Like, I’ve already got such
a full morning ahead of me.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.555
So, when Tash and Kyle leave
the place like a pigsty,

10:38.596 --> 10:41.266
like, that just, like,
puts me through the roof.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.144
Like, the stairwells weren’t
done, the floors looked manky.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.813
Stuff that is standard practice
on every single yacht,

10:46.855 --> 10:47.814
which they should know.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.232
You could have got so much done

10:49.274 --> 10:52.861
to put me ahead this morning,
but you didn’t.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.322
Honestly, I’m over it.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.323
Coming up...

10:57.365 --> 10:58.324
Ah!

10:58.366 --> 10:59.492
[laughing]

10:59.534 --> 11:00.869
Yes!

11:00.910 --> 11:03.413
Welcome to the mini-Olympics
on board Home.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.500
Woo!

11:07.542 --> 11:10.420
Kyle, back to work now.

11:10.462 --> 11:14.341
There’s a line when it comes
to mingling with the guests.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.718
When we’re wearing our uniform,
we’re professional.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.062
Is this what I’m gonna
be doing the course in?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.648
-"Relax."
-Oh, my God.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.525
These are gonna fit the
itty-bitty-titty committee,

11:32.567 --> 11:34.277
but they’re not gonna fit
the big, juggy...

11:34.319 --> 11:37.072
-Oh, my...
-It will fit.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.282
If not, we can cut
them into crop tops.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.911
You might have trouble
disconnecting that line.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.290
Well done, homie.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.835
[laughing]

11:52.712 --> 11:54.422
Here you go, hon.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.383
-Oh, wow.
-Yay!

11:56.424 --> 11:57.384
I could hear your voice.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.593
Can I please get
a heart next time?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.095
I’m not asking for a lot.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.721
Kyle, while you’re enjoying
your lovely coffee,

12:01.763 --> 12:03.431
I’ve vacuumed the bridge,
the captain’s cabin...

12:03.473 --> 12:04.641
Really?

12:04.683 --> 12:05.934
The main salon, the stairwells,

12:05.975 --> 12:07.769
the day heads,
the bridge deck salon,

12:07.811 --> 12:08.978
all the way down,
and wiped.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.524
Yeah, I think we’ll have
a chat at the end of this.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.900
Really?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.902
I think if the shoe
was on the other foot

12:15.944 --> 12:19.364
and Natalia had been up
till, like, 4:00 a.m.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.199
cleaning up, she would
have also been,

12:21.241 --> 12:23.451
like, okay,
I’m gonna go to bed.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.620
It’s, like,
a little bit of cleaning.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.123
Like, it’s not
the end of the world.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.457
I don’t need your ----ing...

12:29.499 --> 12:31.334
I know exactly
I’m doing a good job.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.753
Ugh!

12:33.795 --> 12:35.130
Try and climb up the slide.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.302
If you can get to the top,
you can go down for four hours.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.303
[laughing]

12:42.345 --> 12:43.304
Yep!

12:45.849 --> 12:47.142
Ninja order, baby!

12:47.183 --> 12:48.727
That’s amazing, brah.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.645
Tash, are these for the guests
or are these for us?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.855
Let me just count.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.690
One, two, three, four,
five, six,

12:53.732 --> 12:58.862
seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12, 13.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.950
But the sizes, I don’t know
how I’m gonna do that.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.118
I don’t mind wearing a large.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.661
I don’t need to look hot.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.246
Oh, cute!

13:08.288 --> 13:09.956
[blows whistle]

13:09.998 --> 13:13.126
Hey, guys, just so we’re
on the same page,

13:13.168 --> 13:16.296
we’re gonna have to be,
like, super loud and cheerful,

13:16.338 --> 13:18.590
and, like, shouting and
vibey and, like...

13:18.631 --> 13:20.425
like that, you know?

13:20.467 --> 13:21.343
Okay?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.136
-You mean American.
-Okay!

13:23.178 --> 13:24.512
I’ve always thought,
oh, well, I could be a bosun.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.930
Now that I’ve got
a taste for it, like,

13:25.972 --> 13:27.140
I don’t want anything else.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.850
I need to be
constantly progressing.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.644
So, I’ve got a plan to do, like,
some sort of beer Olympics

13:31.686 --> 13:33.188
and just make the guests happy,

13:33.229 --> 13:35.482
Captain Sandy happy,
so I can say that I did

13:35.523 --> 13:37.692
everything that I could
possibly have done.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.652
I hope we can pull it off.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.281
Crop-top it,
you got the abs, girl.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.449
Yes.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.034
No, you have the tits
for this, though.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.410
All right, we need
to get changed.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.329
Deck crew, deck crew,
put on your costume.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.624
Oh, my God.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.833
Hot.

13:53.875 --> 13:54.834
"Baywatch," "Baywatch,"
"Baywatch."

13:54.876 --> 13:56.670
Babe, come have a look at this.

13:56.711 --> 13:57.879
Ah!

13:57.921 --> 13:58.922
[laughing]

13:58.963 --> 14:00.590
What the [bleep] is that?

14:03.385 --> 14:04.594
Yes!

14:04.636 --> 14:05.845
All right, bring it on, bitches.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.055
I’m so excited to get in
the water.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.056
This is what it’s all about.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.557
Oh, I love it.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.060
I’m doing the noodles,
because I can’t swim.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.271
You want me to pull it down?

14:15.313 --> 14:16.147
Damn!

14:16.189 --> 14:17.440
Should we cut it?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.858
Oh, this is amazing!

14:18.900 --> 14:19.943
-Should we cut it?
-It looks good.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.069
Like, how, though?

14:21.111 --> 14:22.070
Like, up to there.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.072
-Pout.
-I love it.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.908
Who wants to get
their ass kicked?

14:26.950 --> 14:29.411
Too many steps.
It’s too many steps.

14:29.452 --> 14:34.082
Welcome to the
Maltese mini-Olympics

14:34.124 --> 14:35.834
on board Motor Yacht Home.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.961
-Woo!
-Yay!

14:38.003 --> 14:41.256
We have Team Adam’s Family...

14:41.297 --> 14:42.882
Woo!

14:42.924 --> 14:44.759
-Yeah!
-Versus Team Home.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.138
-Woo!
-Boo!

14:48.179 --> 14:50.140
First team is gonna start here.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.641
You guys are gonna have a drink,

14:51.683 --> 14:53.560
run up the right-hand
side of the boat, jump off,

14:53.601 --> 14:56.146
then you’re gonna swim
to the back of this boat.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.441
On your mark, get set, go!

14:59.482 --> 15:00.525
[blows whistle]

15:00.567 --> 15:02.152
Woo!

15:02.193 --> 15:04.112
There she goes!
Yee!

15:04.154 --> 15:06.322
[shrieking]

15:09.117 --> 15:11.036
Come on, David!

15:12.203 --> 15:13.621
Tag me, bitch!

15:13.663 --> 15:14.622
Woo!

15:14.664 --> 15:15.623
I’m gonna win!

15:15.665 --> 15:17.625
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

15:17.667 --> 15:19.002
[whistling]

15:22.047 --> 15:24.132
He’s really committed,
I love that.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.637
Once you get to the trampoline,
you do your best trick.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.638
-Yes, Liam!
-Woo!

15:30.680 --> 15:31.639
Actually pretty good.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.266
Whoa!

15:33.308 --> 15:36.770
You’ve got an egg, but you
gotta run back up to the slide.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.315
Woo!

15:45.028 --> 15:46.613
-Oh, my God.
-Did it!

15:46.654 --> 15:48.114
Shot.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.657
Don’t even let them up here.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.705
[shouting]

15:58.083 --> 16:00.794
-We won!
-Woo!

16:04.089 --> 16:05.340
[shouting, chattering]

16:06.591 --> 16:08.426
That was good, huh?

16:10.428 --> 16:11.179
Woo!

16:11.221 --> 16:12.472
Back to work.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.694
I’m up or down.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.862
Yes! Woo!

16:27.904 --> 16:30.156
[cheering]

16:32.075 --> 16:35.662
That was awesome, well done!

16:35.704 --> 16:39.541
Kyle, back to work now.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.253
Back to work!

16:45.588 --> 16:48.049
Back to work.

16:48.091 --> 16:52.387
It’s a fine line when the guests
want to mingle with the crew.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.723
Like, when you’re having
fun on the water,

16:54.764 --> 16:56.683
the crew feel like oh,
we’re part of the fun,

16:56.725 --> 16:59.269
and some people don’t know
when to end the fun.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.146
If you have respect for yourself

17:01.187 --> 17:04.274
and respect for your industry,
you don’t cross the line.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.735
But I trust every crewmember

17:06.776 --> 17:08.570
until they show me
they can’t be trusted.

17:08.611 --> 17:12.198
I just need them to remember
that line, where that line is.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.786
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>
<i>let’s put away the skis, toys.</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:19.539
Mother----ing slide!

17:20.915 --> 17:22.459
Hello, there.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.211
Yeah, mate, do us a 360 or
summat, show us what you got.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.756
She’s the ----ing
jet-ski queen, brü.

17:27.797 --> 17:28.965
Hundred percent.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.218
Good job, good job,
engine off, fantastic.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.262
Got it?
In properly?

17:34.304 --> 17:35.764
-Yeah.
-Okay, Mzi, throw yours.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.142
Oh, good catch.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.606
Okay, I need...

17:44.647 --> 17:46.232
I think you’re gonna have
to swim Jason’s over,

17:46.274 --> 17:47.275
and then Jason, you’re gonna
pull the bow

17:47.317 --> 17:48.818
and you’re gonna control it.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.403
Giving the boys a run
for their money, hey?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.156
Well done, Courts.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.657
Great job, girl.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.414
Great job, guys.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.166
Noice, boys, noice.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.215
Why?

18:11.091 --> 18:12.300
I did as well.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.636
I have never felt
this torn before.

18:14.678 --> 18:19.641
Rule number one of yachting...
never get romantic with guests.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.310
But also,
I don’t wanna lose this.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.478
Like, this is probably
gonna happen

18:23.520 --> 18:25.730
once in a million charters.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.358
I need to try and figure
out a way

18:28.400 --> 18:31.611
of showing my interest
without losing my job.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.530
I think I was a good boy.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.656
I think we were good.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.157
Like, we’ve been good, Tash.

18:36.199 --> 18:38.660
-No.
-No.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.205
Coming up...

18:42.247 --> 18:43.498
Jason, Jason, Mzi.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.542
Where the [bleep] is Jason?

18:45.583 --> 18:48.003
I asked him to take 15.
That was 45 minutes ago.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.464
It’s not the first time or the
second time or the third time.

19:03.018 --> 19:03.226
Ah!

19:06.563 --> 19:08.440
-I’m just gonna get the...
-I got it.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.694
You’re taking away
my independence!

19:12.736 --> 19:14.696
Myself and Courts,
we obviously have chemistry,

19:14.738 --> 19:16.614
but I think we both
know where we’re at.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.992
We both really like
each other as friends.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.995
Literally just good friends,
and nothing more.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.468
Yeah.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.264
<i>Jason, Jason, Storm.</i>

19:41.306 --> 19:42.640
Go for Jason.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.726
<i>Hey, Jason,</i>
<i>please take 15 minutes.</i>

19:44.768 --> 19:46.936
<i>Get changed,</i>
<i>have something to eat,</i>

19:46.978 --> 19:48.146
<i>I’ll see you back soon.</i>

19:48.188 --> 19:49.814
Courtney, when he’s done,
you can follow.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.815
Copy.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.448
For tonight’s birthday
I’m making three layers

19:58.490 --> 20:01.451
of chocolate cake
with butter icing

20:01.493 --> 20:02.869
and white chocolate ganache.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.288
I’ve made the
Black Pearl once before,

20:05.330 --> 20:06.790
but I did it all dark chocolate.

20:06.831 --> 20:10.460
Doing a pink one, this
is definitely another level.

20:10.502 --> 20:11.961
The Pink Pearl.

20:12.003 --> 20:13.338
Ahoy!

20:13.380 --> 20:15.215
I’ll go wipe the table
and start setting.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.050
Go and get dinner and change.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.218
Yeah, I’ll go change.

20:18.259 --> 20:19.636
So, what’s the theme?

20:23.181 --> 20:25.016
Guys, how we doing?
How’s service, how’s everything?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.976
I’ve been up in laundry,
you know, a bit of, like,

20:27.018 --> 20:29.854
clearing laundry,
your job that you didn’t do.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.356
[sighs]

20:34.526 --> 20:36.486
-Is Jason back?
-No.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.113
[water running]

20:39.489 --> 20:41.741
Please don’t blow away.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.750
All right, it
will sort itself out.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.503
-Hey!
-Well, hello, how are you?

20:53.545 --> 20:54.963
Did you get some rest?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.467
It’s not the last night.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.720
It’s never the last night.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.724
Where the [bleep] is Jason?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.183
-Can you get him, please?
-Yeah.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.644
Because I asked him
to take 15, it’s been 45.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.146
Jason, Jason, Mzi.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.356
-Jason?
-Yeah?

21:13.398 --> 21:14.649
Storm’s wondering where you are.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.069
He said that...

21:18.111 --> 21:20.572
yeah, he said take 15,
and it’s been 45.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.369
I know, I know, I’m just...

21:26.411 --> 21:29.080
he just told me to let you know.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.081
<i>Storm, Storm, Jason.</i>

21:30.123 --> 21:31.708
Go for Storm, Jason.

21:31.750 --> 21:35.920
<i>Putting on my blacks and</i>
<i>be ready in three minutes.</i>

21:35.962 --> 21:38.048
-What did he say?
-Copy that.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.966
That was 45 minutes ago.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.886
It’s not the first time or the
second time or the third time.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.722
There probably
won’t be a fourth time.

21:45.764 --> 21:48.058
There’s always one person
like Jason in any workplace

21:48.099 --> 21:50.727
who’s gonna be defiant,
and personally,

21:50.769 --> 21:53.938
I don’t have a lot of
respect for people like that.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.565
Understand your position
on board

21:55.607 --> 21:57.734
and try help chemistry
rather than destroy it.

21:57.776 --> 22:00.570
Can I just bring out, like, a...

22:00.612 --> 22:02.155
-No.
-Thing of water?

22:02.197 --> 22:03.406
Yeah, sure.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.949
Oh!

22:04.991 --> 22:07.035
Okay, take the water
to the sundeck.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.749
Storm, Storm, Nat.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.250
<i>Go for Storm, Nat.</i>

22:14.292 --> 22:17.587
Is anyone available to help me
on the bridge deck aft?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.381
<i>Copy that,</i>
<i>we’ll be there shortly.</i>

22:19.422 --> 22:20.507
Jason, do you wanna help Nat?

22:20.548 --> 22:23.551
Yeah.

22:23.593 --> 22:24.969
I’m here to help you,
by the way.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.054
Oh, fantastic.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.430
That face of yours.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.932
Maybe start off with these ones.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.226
-And just blow them up?
-Yeah.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.773
[pops]

22:36.815 --> 22:38.108
Oh, my God, it’s beautiful!

22:38.149 --> 22:39.609
It’s so cool!

22:39.651 --> 22:41.111
I’m gonna do
white chocolate sails.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.445
Oh, wow.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.863
Oh, my God, cute.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.866
Oh! Woohoo!

22:46.908 --> 22:50.120
Lemon-ginger tea with a
tequila shot,

22:51.538 --> 22:52.997
and a tequila sunrise.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.334
Wow.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.419
Are you liking it?

22:57.460 --> 22:58.712
Loving it.

22:58.753 --> 23:01.131
-What time is dinner, love?
-Fifteen.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.215
Oh, God.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.717
Let’s get blown.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.760
How many buttons,
one or two?

23:05.802 --> 23:07.137
Oh, let’s do two.

23:07.178 --> 23:08.847
Do you remember how many
you had left in the pack?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.932
-Do you want one?
-Yeah.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.143
Wait, I don’t remember
inviting you on the boat.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.436
Wow!

23:14.477 --> 23:16.646
Bambi has arrived!

23:16.688 --> 23:18.606
Oh, my God, this is so cute!

23:20.358 --> 23:21.943
Just me, shape.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.383
No, he didn’t.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.011
Storm and Mzi and Courtney,
they’ve got their little clique,

23:48.053 --> 23:50.513
so I feel like
I’m absolutely the outsider.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.390
Yeah, it sucks, for sure.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.351
I’m not getting in any drama.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.227
Keeping my mouth shut.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.690
Coming up...

24:00.732 --> 24:02.525
Do you wanna just go and,
like, sit outside.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.779
I feel that we’re
both kind of

24:05.820 --> 24:07.364
treading on glass here
at the moment.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.866
There’s nothing that’s gonna
happen between us now.

24:09.908 --> 24:12.285
But I just have lots
of feelings for you,

24:24.756 --> 24:25.882
Okay, it’s done.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.592
I’m very excited.

24:27.634 --> 24:31.971
Oh my God,
this is amazing.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.014
No way!

24:33.056 --> 24:34.724
Do you want me
to start placing it?

24:34.766 --> 24:37.602
Yeah, watch your hand.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.521
Thanks, Dave.

24:39.562 --> 24:42.565
-Oh, my God!
-Ah!

24:42.607 --> 24:44.275
You’re so hot!

24:44.317 --> 24:46.277
Oh, you know, just
a little ChapStick.

24:46.319 --> 24:50.824
I’m not into girls,
but I can be, for Bambi.

24:52.617 --> 24:53.660
Look who’s here!

24:53.702 --> 24:56.246
Woo!

24:56.287 --> 24:59.290
Happy birthday!

24:59.332 --> 25:01.167
Can I wash some dishes
in here, geezer?

25:01.209 --> 25:02.377
Yeah, man.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.129
He makes really good bread.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.505
What’s for dinner tonight?

25:05.547 --> 25:07.716
It’s a pea gnocchi.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.967
Yeah?

25:09.009 --> 25:10.677
Sea bass for main course.

25:10.719 --> 25:11.803
Yeah?

25:11.845 --> 25:14.931
With a courgette tagliatelle.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.433
Perfect.

25:16.474 --> 25:17.809
Never.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.189
Then you’re back.

25:23.231 --> 25:27.235
Tequila and my emotions is a
cocktail even Tash can’t mix.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.487
I’m gonna carry this one.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.822
I’m following you.

25:30.864 --> 25:32.240
I love the way you eat bread.

25:32.282 --> 25:33.658
Thank you.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.493
Good evening, guys.

25:35.535 --> 25:38.329
You’ve got gnocchi tonight,
it’s caramelized in olive oil,

25:38.371 --> 25:39.539
so it’s nice and crisp.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.832
This is beautiful, thanks.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.792
-Thank you so much.
-You’re welcome.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.085
Thanks a lot, guys,
hope you enjoy it.

25:44.127 --> 25:45.295
Thank you!

25:45.337 --> 25:46.921
-Oh, my God, this is amazing.
-I love it.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.841
-This is amazing.
-This is so good.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.426
It’s too good.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.307
-Lekke, no worries, thank you.
-You did a great job.

25:57.349 --> 26:02.729
Oh, my Jesus Lord, Jesus mercy
Christ, pray for me.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.361
Can I clear this?

26:09.402 --> 26:10.737
Oh, thank you, yes.

26:10.779 --> 26:14.657
Literally, I was, like,
I wanna document this.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.284
Take the photo throughout.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.036
I just like to take them,
like, here and there,

26:18.078 --> 26:19.079
but, like, I had them in one of
my bags so that’s...

26:19.120 --> 26:21.247
-How was dinner?
-It was so good.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.374
Good.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.541
It’s even better now.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.751
Oh, yeah.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.670
-We ready for dessert?
-Yes!

26:26.711 --> 26:28.254
-Yes, we are.
-Hell, yes.

26:30.507 --> 26:34.052
Whoa, that’s crazy!

26:34.094 --> 26:36.096
I am such a child at heart,

26:36.137 --> 26:38.306
and I love cake,
just like I love puppies.

26:38.348 --> 26:39.599
But I love ships.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.977
I’ve never had any chef
make a cake like this.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.146
This pirate ship’s very cool.

26:45.188 --> 26:46.898
Hey, by the way, don’t worry
about service gloves,

26:46.940 --> 26:48.233
I got my new ones.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.735
Why does it go all
the way to the elbow?

26:50.777 --> 26:52.570
Sometimes you need to
go elbow-deep.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.822
Elbow-deep, yeah.

26:56.950 --> 27:02.163
* Happy birthday to you *

27:02.205 --> 27:03.790
Woo!

27:04.624 --> 27:05.792
Thank you!

27:09.004 --> 27:10.922
-So beautiful.
-Isn’t it?

27:10.964 --> 27:13.633
I’m gonna eat it all right now.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.051
Oh, my God.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.886
Oh, my Lord, that’s moist.

27:16.928 --> 27:18.096
And the cake, too.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.809
And it’s dairy-free.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.060
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

27:24.102 --> 27:25.437
-It’s really good.
-No worries.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.980
Mm!

27:28.857 --> 27:29.816
We’ve just gotta dock tomorrow.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.276
Same vibe as last time.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.569
Mm.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.530
You two in the bow,
then join me in the stern.

27:35.572 --> 27:37.699
-Okay, ready?
-Yeah.

27:37.741 --> 27:38.700
Are we ready to go upstairs?

27:38.742 --> 27:39.868
Yes.

27:39.909 --> 27:41.119
We were gonna jump
in the hot tub.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.328
I’m gonna go put on
a bathing suit.

27:42.370 --> 27:43.621
Yes, we shall.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.123
-There’s a lot of clean-up.
-I’m tired!

27:45.165 --> 27:46.958
Almost there, Tash.

27:50.045 --> 27:51.463
Can we leave these
for him for his final,

27:51.504 --> 27:52.672
like, bash,
or what do you think?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.174
Yeah, leave them, leave them.

27:55.759 --> 27:56.885
I’m stuck to the laundry.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.348
Good night.

28:03.350 --> 28:05.769
Oh!

28:05.810 --> 28:07.645
-Nat?
-I’ve hit a wall.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.564
Yeah, me too.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.483
I went into the...

28:13.026 --> 28:15.028
How much longer
do you have left?

28:18.323 --> 28:20.367
[chuckles]

28:24.079 --> 28:25.455
Cadbury finger biscuits.

28:25.497 --> 28:26.915
Oh, my God, the fingers.

28:26.956 --> 28:29.209
Nothing like a good
finger before bed.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.006
Oh, my God, let’s cuddle.

28:40.095 --> 28:41.096
-Sorry.
-No, no stress, dude.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.305
Sorry, I got up late.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.732
Settle down.

28:52.774 --> 28:56.069
I like Storm, but I’ve
just got trust issues.

28:56.111 --> 28:58.988
My longest relationship
is seven weeks.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.740
I was, like, 17.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.158
I had my first Valentine,

29:02.200 --> 29:03.743
then, like,
midway through dinner,

29:03.785 --> 29:05.120
he left because
his ex-girlfriend

29:05.161 --> 29:06.538
said that he wanted him back.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.915
And on top of that,
he left me with the bill.

29:08.957 --> 29:10.875
I’m gonna go to bed.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.461
-You cut your hair?
-Yeah, swimsuits, babe.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.548
Oh, my God,
look at the lido deck!

29:16.589 --> 29:18.008
Viberella.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.259
"Viberella."

29:19.300 --> 29:21.302
Oh, my God, muy caliente.

29:21.344 --> 29:22.929
-Is it really?
-Yeah.

29:22.971 --> 29:23.930
Yes!

29:23.972 --> 29:25.348
I love it, it feels so good.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.434
I feel like a big, gay soup.

29:29.019 --> 29:32.355
Sorry, I’m just coming in now,
the door’s so loud.

29:32.397 --> 29:33.898
Yeah.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.275
You see Jason?

29:36.735 --> 29:38.153
What time did he come?

29:42.741 --> 29:44.367
Ten minutes before, right.

30:04.095 --> 30:06.181
What?

30:09.559 --> 30:10.352
Ooh!

30:10.393 --> 30:12.270
-You want vodka?
-Tequila.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.105
It seems like a lonely job.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.273
I mean, it seems really cool

30:15.315 --> 30:16.483
because you can
travel everywhere.

30:16.524 --> 30:17.776
Yeah.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.235
But, like, it seems
like you’re alone a lot.

30:19.277 --> 30:20.445
I am, I’m alone here
all the time.

30:20.487 --> 30:21.696
Yeah.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.281
Because of that,
I struggle to find a partner.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.824
You have the wit, though,
you have the gay...

30:24.866 --> 30:26.785
-sorry, the gay wit.
-No!

30:26.826 --> 30:28.411
Yeah, you know, like,
I don’t have that.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.622
I think that wit came
from protecting myself

30:30.663 --> 30:33.083
in the places that I grew up
in and were around.

30:33.124 --> 30:35.085
But if it’s, like,
an awkward situation,

30:35.126 --> 30:36.503
I defuse it with humor.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.546
Right, yeah.

30:38.588 --> 30:40.674
See, that’s a gift.
That’s literally a gift.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.801
Because I’m like a deer in
headlights when that happens.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.928
That’s what I find
so cute about you, though.

30:44.969 --> 30:46.137
I don’t know how to handle that.

30:46.179 --> 30:47.430
I literally...

30:47.472 --> 30:49.307
I’m like,
you’re so cute that way.

30:49.349 --> 30:51.351
I’m like, that’s adorable.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.979
I like it so much.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.523
Yeah.

30:56.564 --> 30:57.774
I don’t like really
talking a lot about myself.

30:57.816 --> 30:59.150
Right.

30:59.192 --> 31:00.318
I don’t but
I wanna hear you, you know?

31:00.360 --> 31:01.986
I lost 85 pounds recently.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.279
Congratulations.

31:03.321 --> 31:04.531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:04.572 --> 31:05.990
Frank, he’s visually
very appealing.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.617
By the sounds
of our conversation,

31:07.659 --> 31:09.994
he’s really giving
me heart as well.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.413
That is sexy for me.

31:11.454 --> 31:14.082
Listen, that can make
anybody moist,

31:14.124 --> 31:15.750
is a really good,
deep conversation.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.669
[laughing]

31:17.711 --> 31:18.795
I love that.

31:18.837 --> 31:20.171
Yes, yeah.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.423
Yeah, I think they’re
gonna be a thing.

31:21.464 --> 31:24.175
I think that Kyle
will ask Frank.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.510
Yeah, Frank is too shy.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.679
-I encourage.
-Yeah, I encourage as well.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.389
-I’m gonna go to bed.
-I’m gonna go to bed too.

31:29.431 --> 31:32.475
I wanna wake up really
gorgeous tomorrow.

31:32.517 --> 31:33.810
Sweet dreams.

31:36.271 --> 31:37.689
Oh, mm, yeah, you too, babe.

31:37.731 --> 31:40.734
You’re such, like,
a warm, fuzzy essence.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.738
-But we’ll catch up.
-All right.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.823
[chattering]

31:46.865 --> 31:47.782
Yeah.

31:51.661 --> 31:53.079
So ----ing horny.

31:53.121 --> 31:55.623
[Natasha laughs]

31:55.665 --> 31:56.875
Coming up...

31:56.916 --> 31:59.210
Is heart palpitations
normal before docking?

31:59.252 --> 32:00.545
Honestly, it’s fine.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.130
I’m fine.

32:02.172 --> 32:06.551
I know how to dock, but I’m not
fully confident with it yet.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.637
If I [bleep] up,
then it’s, like, dangerous.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.052
I can see messages flashing up
from my boyfriend,

32:51.596 --> 32:53.890
but there’s
just not enough hours in the day

32:53.932 --> 32:55.475
to chat with him.

32:55.517 --> 32:59.854
I feel guilty because
my boyfriend’s having issues

32:59.896 --> 33:03.483
with me still continuing to
work with Dave, understandably.

33:03.525 --> 33:06.194
But I don’t know
what I’m supposed to do.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.823
Very good, so clever.

33:12.784 --> 33:13.952
Good morning.

33:13.993 --> 33:15.245
-Long black?
-Yes.

33:15.286 --> 33:16.579
I’ll bring it up to the sundeck.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.915
Thank you.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.542
Here we go.

33:23.712 --> 33:25.338
Thank you, I loved
the touch of the orange.

33:25.380 --> 33:26.923
Did you?
Thank you.

33:26.965 --> 33:28.216
I’ll be here all week.

33:28.258 --> 33:29.759
-So...
-Jesus Christ!

33:29.801 --> 33:31.302
Oh, my God.

33:31.344 --> 33:32.637
Seriously?

33:39.019 --> 33:40.729
[humming]

33:42.439 --> 33:44.816
Morning, Adam.

33:44.858 --> 33:46.693
Storm, Storm, Sandy.

33:46.735 --> 33:47.569
Captain.

33:47.610 --> 33:50.780
<i>I have to haul anchor at 9:45.</i>

33:50.822 --> 33:52.073
Copy that.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.366
Court, Court, Storm.

33:53.408 --> 33:54.951
You guys can help me
move the tender.

33:54.993 --> 33:56.703
Yeah, copy, on our way down.

33:56.745 --> 34:00.915
We’re about to haul anchor and
leave at 9:45, just so you know.

34:00.957 --> 34:02.125
Oh, that’s sad.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.251
<i>Jason, Jason, Jason for Storm.</i>

34:03.293 --> 34:04.711
<i>This is Jason.</i>

34:04.753 --> 34:06.588
Hey, Jason, we’re hauling anchor
in 30 minutes.

34:06.629 --> 34:08.590
Please, can you get to the bow
as soon as possible?

34:09.758 --> 34:11.384
<i>En route.</i>

34:28.860 --> 34:30.070
There’s Adam!

34:30.111 --> 34:31.279
Good morning, sleepyhead.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.239
-Good morning.
-It’s Friday!

34:33.281 --> 34:35.241
Pudding!

34:35.283 --> 34:36.993
I hate these hats.

34:37.035 --> 34:39.871
<i>Jason, Jason for Storm, can you</i>
<i>come to the bridge deck aft?</i>

34:39.913 --> 34:43.249
Jen, are you happy
for me to start just,

34:43.291 --> 34:45.335
like, putting your luggage...

34:45.377 --> 34:46.378
like, folding it and, like...

34:46.419 --> 34:48.421
Jason, Jason, do you copy?

34:52.133 --> 34:54.594
Ugh, mate, this sh-- annoys
the sh-- out of me.

34:54.636 --> 34:56.096
Good morning, good morning,
how’d you sleep?

34:56.137 --> 34:57.639
Great.

34:57.681 --> 34:59.265
<i>Can you send Jason</i>
<i>to the bridge deck aft, please,</i>

34:59.307 --> 35:00.433
<i>to catch the line?</i>

35:00.475 --> 35:02.602
-Yo.
-Where’s your radio?

35:02.644 --> 35:05.480
-It’s on me.
-Oh, there’s the pigeon.

35:05.522 --> 35:06.898
I’ve called you three times.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.650
Yeah, I’m...

35:08.692 --> 35:09.859
You need to respond so
I know that you’ve heard it.

35:09.901 --> 35:11.486
All right.

35:11.528 --> 35:15.281
Sorry I was not moving
fast enough for you, Storm.

35:15.323 --> 35:16.866
I’m not a dog.

35:16.908 --> 35:18.785
I need you to jump in and
just hook the cradle up for me.

35:18.827 --> 35:19.661
Okay.

35:19.703 --> 35:20.954
-Morning.
-Good morning.

35:20.995 --> 35:22.205
How’d you sleep?

35:22.247 --> 35:23.289
Rock-solid, dead-ass.

35:23.331 --> 35:24.666
-Same.
-Sweet.

35:24.708 --> 35:25.959
I’m super excited.

35:26.001 --> 35:27.627
Like, tonight’s
bomb-dot-com for me.

35:27.669 --> 35:28.628
Exactly.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.047
Your outfit better be on point.

35:31.089 --> 35:32.799
[laughing]

35:33.842 --> 35:35.301
Wow.

35:35.343 --> 35:39.472
Ooh! Stay.

35:39.514 --> 35:41.307
This is amazing.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.685
<i>Tender’s on its way,</i>
<i>tender’s on its way.</i>

35:43.727 --> 35:46.438
Pull, Mzi.

35:46.479 --> 35:47.439
All right, you good there, Mzi?

35:47.480 --> 35:48.440
Yeah.

35:48.481 --> 35:49.774
Great job, great job, great job.

35:49.816 --> 35:50.775
What are we supposed to
do in terms of food

35:50.817 --> 35:52.318
for the rest of our lives?

35:52.360 --> 35:54.487
I think just, you know, same
that we were doing before.

35:54.529 --> 35:56.114
Back to, like, mac
and cheese, I guess.

35:56.156 --> 35:59.701
Okay, start hauling the anchor,
we can start hauling the anchor.

36:02.662 --> 36:04.706
Anchor in the pocket,
anchor in the pocket.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.418
Boom, we’re going back
to the dock.

36:08.460 --> 36:14.007
Okay, these fenders are
purely in case, yeah?

36:14.049 --> 36:15.342
Yeah.

36:15.383 --> 36:17.218
So if I say grab a fender,
grab a fender...

36:17.260 --> 36:18.553
Yeah.

36:18.595 --> 36:20.805
Hey, guys, when
we come into port

36:20.847 --> 36:22.390
I’m gonna be running
up and down here.

36:22.432 --> 36:23.391
We can go inside.

36:23.433 --> 36:24.851
No, you can stay.

36:24.893 --> 36:26.061
I’m just saying, like,
if you see me running,

36:26.102 --> 36:27.562
I just don’t wanna...

36:27.604 --> 36:28.563
No, no, we don’t wanna
get in the way at all.

36:28.605 --> 36:29.773
I don’t wanna hurt you.

36:29.814 --> 36:30.857
Please do!

36:30.899 --> 36:31.691
[laughing]

36:31.733 --> 36:33.902
Dresses, dresses, dresses.

36:37.655 --> 36:39.616
I feel like I can maybe
make it with this.

36:41.576 --> 36:43.370
But who knows?

36:43.411 --> 36:46.373
It’s all part of the fun, hey?

36:46.414 --> 36:48.750
Is heart palpitations normal
before docking?

36:48.792 --> 36:51.378
Honestly, it’s fine.
I’m fine.

36:51.419 --> 36:53.046
I’m fine.

36:53.088 --> 36:54.964
So, you do that, and then
when they say lock it off,

36:55.006 --> 36:56.383
you just lock it off
where it is?

36:56.424 --> 36:59.052
Yeah, so it just flows through,

36:59.094 --> 37:01.596
and it’s just easier
to lock it off.

37:01.638 --> 37:02.889
Okay, with you.

37:02.931 --> 37:05.475
-And then you just...
-Mm-hmm.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.560
Okay, with you, I’ll try it.

37:07.602 --> 37:09.312
I’m all for new ideas,

37:09.354 --> 37:11.398
especially when I’m trying to
pull this whole ----ing boat in

37:11.439 --> 37:13.066
with our hands.

37:13.108 --> 37:15.902
[bleep] I’m scared.

37:15.944 --> 37:17.904
It’s, like, stressing me out.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.906
Okay, guys,
I’m gonna head to the stern.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.741
You’re gonna stay on
the port side?

37:21.783 --> 37:23.118
Yep.

37:26.621 --> 37:27.872
I think it’s gonna be good.

37:27.914 --> 37:29.582
This boat is a smaller yacht,

37:29.624 --> 37:32.877
so everyone’s got their own
certain job when we’re docking.

37:32.919 --> 37:35.255
If I [bleep] up,
then it’s, like, dangerous.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.549
Like, my brain is probably
my biggest enemy,

37:37.590 --> 37:40.593
because the more
I think about something,

37:40.635 --> 37:42.512
the more scared I am to do it.

37:42.554 --> 37:45.181
Jesus Christ,
that’s ----ing tight.

37:46.683 --> 37:49.019
-Seven and eight.
<i>-Okay.</i>

37:58.069 --> 37:59.696
Jesus Christ,
that’s ----ing tight.

38:01.531 --> 38:03.533
[bleep] me.

38:03.575 --> 38:05.076
Am I clear?

38:05.118 --> 38:07.829
You are clear to swing on V2,
clear to swing on V2.

38:07.871 --> 38:10.040
<i>You’re going in</i>
<i>between V3 and V4.</i>

38:10.081 --> 38:12.667
Okay, three and four, copy.

38:12.709 --> 38:16.004
Fifty meters to V3 off
your starboard quarter.

38:16.046 --> 38:19.174
Three meters off V3 off
your starboard quarter.

38:19.215 --> 38:20.800
You are clear.

38:20.842 --> 38:23.053
Thirty meters off
your stern to the dock.

38:23.094 --> 38:25.221
Okay, you’re gonna throw
that line to her,

38:25.263 --> 38:26.473
and you’re gonna put
it on that point, yeah?

38:26.514 --> 38:27.682
Yeah.

38:27.724 --> 38:28.933
I need to...
can I wait a little bit?

38:28.975 --> 38:30.185
Okay.

38:30.226 --> 38:33.063
[bleep] like, I do not
know distances at all,

38:33.104 --> 38:36.775
so I’m literally
stood there, like...

38:36.816 --> 38:39.611
Twenty-five meters off
your stern to the dock.

38:41.363 --> 38:42.822
Ready?

38:42.864 --> 38:44.532
No, wait, wait,
I’ll tell you when to do it.

38:44.574 --> 38:45.950
Oh [bleep].

38:45.992 --> 38:47.744
<i>Twenty meters off your</i>
<i>stern to the dock.</i>

38:47.786 --> 38:50.246
<i>Captain, if you can</i>
<i>do one more bump to port,</i>

38:50.288 --> 38:51.831
<i>we should be good.</i>

38:51.873 --> 38:53.458
Okay, just wait,
Court, just stand by.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.834
Yep.

38:54.876 --> 38:56.878
Ten meters to the dock,
ten meters to the dock.

38:57.921 --> 38:59.464
Okay, you throw your line,
please.

38:59.506 --> 39:00.840
Throw your line, please.

39:00.882 --> 39:02.884
-Can you get that?
-[bleep] dunno.

39:02.926 --> 39:03.927
-Ready?
-Throw it, ready?

39:03.968 --> 39:05.387
Get it first time, please, yes?

39:05.428 --> 39:06.971
Courts, you want me to do it?

39:07.013 --> 39:08.181
No, I’ve got it... one...

39:08.223 --> 39:11.267
Throw it, girl,
throw, throw, throw.

39:11.309 --> 39:12.769
Well done, okay.

39:12.811 --> 39:14.354
-Good job.
-Good job, guys.

39:14.396 --> 39:16.439
-Yay!
-Whew!

39:16.481 --> 39:20.777
All crew, all crew, let’s meet
on the dock for guest departure.

39:24.906 --> 39:26.408
Even my bum’s sweating.

39:26.449 --> 39:28.326
Our holiday is over.

39:28.368 --> 39:29.744
[bleep] it’s hot.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.705
-Cool.
-Is that everything?

39:31.746 --> 39:35.041
Yeah.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.126
[vocalizing]

39:37.544 --> 39:39.087
Four down, five to go.

39:41.297 --> 39:42.590
Thank you so much.
It was so amazing.

39:42.632 --> 39:44.551
Thank you so much
for everything.

39:44.592 --> 39:48.263
[chattering]

39:48.304 --> 39:49.973
-Bye, babe.
-Mwah.

39:55.186 --> 39:56.813
I’ll see you.

39:56.855 --> 39:58.314
Thank you so much.

39:58.356 --> 39:59.482
-Sandy.
-It was awesome.

39:59.524 --> 40:00.775
Thank you so much.

40:00.817 --> 40:02.652
You guys made
my thirtieth birthday

40:02.694 --> 40:04.946
more than I could ever ask for.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.699
So, I just wanted to thank
the interior and exterior crew

40:07.741 --> 40:09.868
for going the extra
million miles.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.995
Thank you for putting
out the water toys,

40:12.037 --> 40:15.040
which seemed super complicated
and awful every time.

40:15.081 --> 40:17.417
Thank you for putting up
the crazy slide,

40:17.459 --> 40:19.127
and the food was amazing.

40:19.169 --> 40:22.589
But most of all, we felt
like you guys

40:22.630 --> 40:24.132
became a part of our family,

40:24.174 --> 40:26.092
and I’m profoundly
grateful for all of you.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.635
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

40:27.677 --> 40:28.970
-Thanks, Adam!
-Thanks, Adam!

40:29.012 --> 40:31.056
-You’re the best.
-Thank you, guys.

40:31.097 --> 40:32.807
Bye!

40:32.849 --> 40:34.434
-What a lovely speech!
-My gosh.

40:34.476 --> 40:35.477
That was so emotional.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.103
Wow.

40:37.145 --> 40:39.898
All right, everyone, out of
your whites, into your reds,

40:39.939 --> 40:41.232
let’s turn the boat around,

40:41.274 --> 40:42.567
and I will let you know
when the tip meeting is.

40:42.609 --> 40:44.694
Thank you, thank you.

40:53.703 --> 40:55.955
Now, it’s 4:00 right now.

40:55.997 --> 40:58.958
Let’s bang out the sundeck,
make it nice.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.585
Let’s do the bow.

41:00.627 --> 41:01.878
-I got it.
-And then we’re done.

41:08.051 --> 41:09.219
Meh.

41:12.263 --> 41:16.017
All crew, all crew, meet in the
main salon for our tip meeting.

41:16.059 --> 41:17.894
<i>Copy.</i>

41:22.440 --> 41:23.983
The hot seat.

41:24.025 --> 41:25.777
All right,
so charter number four.

41:25.819 --> 41:28.613
I’m pleased with everyone.

41:28.655 --> 41:31.199
The cake...
it was insane.

41:31.241 --> 41:33.827
Watching all those toys,
it is not easy.

41:33.868 --> 41:36.413
You conquered the slide,
that was awesome.

41:36.454 --> 41:37.956
The games were great.

41:37.997 --> 41:40.333
That was a great idea,
you did an awesome job.

41:40.375 --> 41:42.836
So, with that, I have
an announcement to make.

41:42.877 --> 41:46.715
I am making Storm bosun.

41:46.756 --> 41:49.718
-Yeah!
-Yay!

41:49.759 --> 41:50.969
-Cheers!
-Yeah, buddy!

41:51.011 --> 41:52.929
-Well done!
-Thank you!

41:52.971 --> 41:55.390
Congrats, you earned it.

41:55.432 --> 41:56.307
Thanks, Cap.

41:56.349 --> 41:57.642
-Well done.
-Thanks, babe.

41:57.684 --> 41:58.643
-Well done, everyone.
-Yes!

41:58.685 --> 42:00.228
Congrats.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.063
All right, there’s one thing
I wanna talk about.

42:02.105 --> 42:05.358
There’s a line when it comes
to mingling with the guests.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.403
When I say everybody back in
their uniforms and back to work,

42:08.445 --> 42:10.363
that doesn’t mean
go down the slide.

42:10.405 --> 42:13.408
Yes, they’re friendly, but when
we’re wearing our uniform

42:13.450 --> 42:15.910
and we’re assigned under this
vessel, we’re a professional.

42:15.952 --> 42:18.747
We just can’t forget that.

42:18.788 --> 42:20.707
Me?

42:20.749 --> 42:22.250
No.

42:22.292 --> 42:24.210
It won’t happen again,
obviously, but thank you

42:24.252 --> 42:27.672
for putting that
subtle comment in there.

42:27.714 --> 42:32.761
So, our tip is $20,000 U.S.
That’s $1,800 per person.

42:32.802 --> 42:34.012
-Thank you, Cap.
-Yay!

42:34.054 --> 42:35.597
-Cheers, bruv.
-Thank you very much.

42:35.638 --> 42:38.933
I still think this is like
some sort of crazy dream.

42:38.975 --> 42:40.310
But I’m like [bleep] yes.

42:40.352 --> 42:41.895
I’m gonna try my best
to kick ass.

42:41.936 --> 42:43.605
I’m so stoked.

42:43.646 --> 42:45.065
I’m very stoked.

42:45.106 --> 42:46.441
Thank you very much,
guys, well done.

42:46.483 --> 42:47.650
Well deserved.

42:47.692 --> 42:49.652
-Enjoy your night out.
-Will do, thank you.

42:49.694 --> 42:53.365
I just need you to remind
your deck team about the line

42:53.406 --> 42:55.200
that captain’s speaking about,
that you guys are crossing.

42:55.241 --> 42:57.118
Okay, Mr. Pajama Party
at 9:00 p.m.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.787
No, it’s honestly so tough.

42:58.828 --> 43:00.622
Like, on the other hand, like,
they’re complimenting,

43:00.663 --> 43:02.457
saying, you know, they
felt like a family with us.

43:02.499 --> 43:04.084
Then it’s like how do you make
that connection

43:04.125 --> 43:06.461
without crossing that line
to a certain point?

43:06.503 --> 43:08.880
There’s a line with
guests and you.

43:08.922 --> 43:10.340
This is the guest, this is you.

43:10.382 --> 43:11.841
This is the guests,
this is everyone...

43:11.883 --> 43:13.093
this is the guest, this is
everyone else on the boat...

43:13.134 --> 43:14.344
This is the shocker.

43:14.386 --> 43:15.261
This is you.

43:15.303 --> 43:16.638
I didn’t go far enough down.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.473
Can someone hang me off the
side of the boat

43:18.515 --> 43:21.393
so I could show Kyle how low
he is compared to the guests?

43:21.434 --> 43:22.977
Okay?

43:23.019 --> 43:24.896
Okay, let’s rock.

43:27.148 --> 43:28.358
Busy, busy, busy.

43:30.610 --> 43:32.237
Namaste, namaste.

43:32.278 --> 43:34.197
I need a twerking song, Courts.

43:34.239 --> 43:36.074
* So, I’m here on a yacht
and I’m doing a lot *

43:36.116 --> 43:37.575
* There’s so much to do,
but I’m feeling so blue *

43:37.617 --> 43:39.411
* I really like to twerk
and make the dollar *

43:39.452 --> 43:41.413
* But I ain’t gonna strip
and make you holler *

43:41.454 --> 43:43.331
* Don’t be fooled,
twerking tonight *

43:43.373 --> 43:46.167
* Because I’m more like a
stew and less like a tart *

43:46.209 --> 43:47.836
* Popping champagne,
making the dough *

43:47.877 --> 43:49.796
* Captain Sandy on the helm
and me on the flow *

43:49.838 --> 43:51.756
* Twerking *

43:51.798 --> 43:53.967
All right.

43:59.973 --> 44:02.058
Mm-hmm.

44:10.275 --> 44:12.902
I feel that we’re both
kind of

44:12.944 --> 44:14.821
treading on glass here
at the moment.

44:14.863 --> 44:16.614
I at least wanna be her friend,

44:16.656 --> 44:19.325
but I don’t want her to treat me
differently to everyone else.

44:19.367 --> 44:22.370
We need to reach an agreement
which suits both of us.

44:22.412 --> 44:25.957
Look, we don’t have
to be friends,

44:25.999 --> 44:27.417
but we need to work together.

44:27.459 --> 44:29.961
Yeah, and we obviously
know there’s nothing

44:30.003 --> 44:34.257
that’s gonna happen between us
now, so we both understand that,

44:34.299 --> 44:39.220
and that we both can
get on with each other.

44:39.262 --> 44:41.431
No, I just had lots of
feelings for you,

44:41.473 --> 44:46.436
and you, like, broke my heart,
so I was just upset.

44:46.478 --> 44:49.564
And I’m not scared to say that.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.900
Fair enough.

44:51.941 --> 44:54.569
So, now I know that’s not
gonna happen, which is fine.

44:54.611 --> 44:56.237
I’m a big boy.

44:56.279 --> 44:59.699
But I still think you’re
an amazing person, all right,

44:59.741 --> 45:00.950
and that’ll never change.

45:01.868 --> 45:03.078
I’m sorry, Davey.

45:03.119 --> 45:04.996
It’s, like...
what a mess.

45:05.038 --> 45:06.456
Am I allowed to give you a hug?

45:08.875 --> 45:10.293
Sorry.

45:10.335 --> 45:11.961
You’re all right.

45:12.003 --> 45:13.630
It’ll be fine.

45:13.672 --> 45:17.133
That’s the cleanest that toilet
has ever been and ever will be.

45:21.429 --> 45:23.223
-Golden, baby.
-Sweet.

45:23.264 --> 45:26.601
Ready to have a beer
with the boys.

45:27.852 --> 45:28.978
<i>Storm, Storm, Jason.</i>

45:29.020 --> 45:30.271
Yes, go ahead, Jason.

45:30.313 --> 45:32.273
<i>-Done on the bow.</i>
-All right.

45:32.315 --> 45:33.692
<i>Washed and rinsed.</i>

45:33.733 --> 45:36.778
Cheers.

45:36.820 --> 45:38.613
----ing water’s still on.

45:38.655 --> 45:40.740
Towels.

45:40.782 --> 45:42.450
[bleep]

45:42.492 --> 45:44.953
<i>Deck crew, deck crew for Storm.</i>

45:44.994 --> 45:46.788
Yeah, boys,
please meet me on the bow.

45:46.830 --> 45:48.498
It’s not finished.

45:48.540 --> 45:49.582
<i>Copy that.</i>

45:52.502 --> 45:54.129
Did he not?

45:54.170 --> 45:57.007
That’s fine, I’ll just tell
Storm that you’re showering.

45:59.467 --> 46:01.011
[chuckles]

46:01.052 --> 46:02.429
Dude, Jason says
the bow’s finished.

46:02.470 --> 46:03.930
The hose was still plugged in,

46:03.972 --> 46:05.932
it was turned on, and
the fenders are still here.

46:05.974 --> 46:07.225
I was told that
the bow was done.

46:07.267 --> 46:08.601
Yeah, I was told that, too.

46:08.643 --> 46:09.519
Where is he?

46:09.561 --> 46:11.021
The helipad’s coming next week.

46:13.690 --> 46:15.316
What are you doing now?

46:15.358 --> 46:17.527
Oh, there’s a couple more things
I need to tidy up, mate.

46:24.993 --> 46:26.494
Coming up...

46:26.536 --> 46:28.705
I’m gonna save this first kiss
for the first date.

46:28.747 --> 46:32.167
I waited a long time to
have a moment like this.

46:32.208 --> 46:33.501
That was hard.

46:35.170 --> 46:37.172
You don’t know what’s gonna
happen in the future.

46:53.855 --> 46:55.273
All crewat 0900 hours. will be
departing the dock tomorrow

46:56.816 --> 47:00.320
<i>Guests will board us on anchor,</i>
<i>due to potential weather.</i>

47:03.823 --> 47:05.075
Bootylicious babe!

47:05.116 --> 47:06.576
Wow!

47:10.497 --> 47:13.500
Getting high up in this joint,
there’s so much fragrance.

47:13.541 --> 47:16.211
If you make me late for
my mans, you’re dead.

47:16.252 --> 47:17.212
I’m ready.

47:17.253 --> 47:18.338
Want a beer, bro?

47:18.380 --> 47:19.964
I’m gonna take it easy, bro.

47:20.006 --> 47:21.591
Let’s get loose.

47:21.633 --> 47:23.134
No, no, I’m not going anywhere.

47:23.176 --> 47:25.887
If I’m drinking lots of spirits,
I tend to not be myself.

47:25.929 --> 47:27.263
I can’t hold my tongue.

47:27.305 --> 47:29.974
And since me and Tash
spoke to each other,

47:30.016 --> 47:32.936
I’m quite humble and I don’t
want to [bleep] up again.

47:32.977 --> 47:36.439
It’s so much easier to get along
than it is

47:36.481 --> 47:39.609
to have any sort of
bad vibes with each other.

47:39.651 --> 47:42.362
So, tonight I wanna have
a clear mind.

47:43.947 --> 47:45.323
Okay, can we please go?

47:45.365 --> 47:46.366
-Yes!
-All right, all right.

47:46.408 --> 47:47.826
Yes, I’m ready.

47:47.867 --> 47:49.994
I wanna go see Frank and
get some quality [bleep].

47:50.036 --> 47:51.204
Oh, my God.

47:51.246 --> 47:52.539
Yes, girl,
you’re looking fabulous.

47:52.580 --> 47:53.331
Yay!

47:53.373 --> 47:54.666
Let’s go out.

47:54.708 --> 47:55.834
Is Dave coming?

47:55.875 --> 47:57.460
No, Dave’s nighty-night.

47:59.129 --> 48:00.255
I’ll come with you, brü.

48:00.296 --> 48:02.507
I’m gonna twerk!

48:02.549 --> 48:04.009
Ah!

48:04.050 --> 48:05.343
How you doing tonight?

48:05.385 --> 48:07.220
Yeah, very cool, my brü.
Tired, dude.

48:07.262 --> 48:11.141
-Ah!
-Woo!

48:11.182 --> 48:12.308
[screaming]

48:16.062 --> 48:17.647
What’s going on?

48:20.900 --> 48:24.863
Oh, my God, this is
such a beautiful night.

48:24.904 --> 48:26.573
Please, can we have
a lot of alcohol?

48:26.614 --> 48:28.908
Ah!

48:30.201 --> 48:31.745
So hot, are you kidding me?

48:31.786 --> 48:34.706
[chattering]

48:34.748 --> 48:36.207
Hey, you look great.
Mwah.

48:36.249 --> 48:38.543
Mm.

48:38.585 --> 48:40.045
-You look great.
-Thank you.

48:40.086 --> 48:41.921
I’m so happy that we were
able to come.

48:41.963 --> 48:44.257
-Like, honestly so happy.
-I’m so glad you came, though.

48:45.133 --> 48:46.676
[cheers]

48:46.718 --> 48:48.345
Ah!

49:01.775 --> 49:03.026
Yeah.

49:12.327 --> 49:14.412
She’s mine!

49:14.454 --> 49:16.915
I finally feel free,
I can be myself.

49:16.956 --> 49:20.001
I can actually enjoy
what I love doing most.

49:20.043 --> 49:21.544
I love to party.

49:21.586 --> 49:24.255
Dave, can you just stay on
the boat every night out?

49:24.297 --> 49:26.675
[shrieking]

49:27.634 --> 49:29.052
We hardly ever kiss.

49:29.094 --> 49:31.304
We’ve been on the boat
for, like, three weeks,

49:31.346 --> 49:32.764
hardly ever a kiss.

49:32.806 --> 49:33.973
Oh, my God, that’s so sweet.

49:56.788 --> 49:58.915
I’ve never felt a spark like
this for someone before.

49:58.957 --> 50:02.877
I’m nervous, because this guy
is someone I actually like.

50:02.919 --> 50:06.256
People see us giving hugs,
but actually, it’s a swordfight.

50:06.297 --> 50:08.091
[laughing]

50:09.676 --> 50:11.136
Keep going till, like, here.

50:11.177 --> 50:12.637
Thanks.

50:22.272 --> 50:23.857
Let’s go!

50:26.026 --> 50:28.486
It’s nice to, like,
hold hands with you, jeez.

50:28.528 --> 50:32.407
Every time we go to this,
you’re like... ow!

50:32.449 --> 50:35.076
Look at the blood on my hand.

50:49.883 --> 50:51.885
So, she’s a fierce little lady.

50:51.926 --> 50:53.011
I like her a lot.

50:54.888 --> 50:55.889
----ing A.

51:04.356 --> 51:05.857
[laughing]

51:05.899 --> 51:07.859
-Bye, everyone!
-Love you!

51:07.901 --> 51:09.402
-Oh, my God.
-We’ll miss you.

51:09.444 --> 51:11.071
We’ve gotta go.

51:17.577 --> 51:19.162
Thank you so
much for everything.

51:19.204 --> 51:22.791
I, like, literally
never get to do this.

51:26.211 --> 51:27.545
Saving it, saving it.

51:28.588 --> 51:30.256
-Mm.
-Mm.

51:30.298 --> 51:32.008
Thank you so much, honestly,
I’m so glad.

51:32.050 --> 51:33.843
You have
the most amazing birthday.

51:33.885 --> 51:35.428
-The most amazing time.
-Where’s Kyle?

51:35.470 --> 51:37.597
Bye!

51:39.015 --> 51:40.642
That was hard.

51:40.684 --> 51:43.061
-Oh!
-Bye, everyone.

51:47.691 --> 51:51.444
I waited a long time to
have a moment like this.

51:53.113 --> 51:54.948
You don’t know what’s
gonna happen in the future,

51:54.989 --> 51:59.244
especially, like, with Frank
and I, what’s gonna go on.

51:59.285 --> 52:01.287
You don’t wanna be
away from someone

52:01.329 --> 52:02.956
that makes you feel so good.

52:02.997 --> 52:04.749
Oh!

52:04.791 --> 52:07.752
Oh, honey, get in the car.
I know it’s so emotional.

52:07.794 --> 52:09.921
-He’s there.
-Oh.

52:09.963 --> 52:11.339
-Aw!
-Can I say goodbye?

52:11.381 --> 52:14.175
No, open the window, say,
"I love you, Frank."

52:14.217 --> 52:15.427
Frank!

52:15.468 --> 52:17.554
I love you!

52:18.596 --> 52:20.265
He’s-- oh!

52:20.306 --> 52:21.725
[screaming]

52:49.169 --> 52:51.463
Later this season on
"Below Deck Med"...

52:51.504 --> 52:53.173
Good job, Captain Courtney!

52:53.214 --> 52:54.299
Nice location.

52:54.341 --> 52:57.886
Woo!

53:00.013 --> 53:01.723
That’s girl power, right there.

53:01.765 --> 53:03.933
-Go!
-Woo!

53:06.353 --> 53:08.271
-Oh, my God.
-It’s delicious.

53:08.313 --> 53:09.397
Oh sh--.

53:09.439 --> 53:11.149
The real Dolly’s here.

53:11.191 --> 53:13.485
Holy sh--.

53:13.526 --> 53:15.195
Yes, girl.

53:15.236 --> 53:16.404
Bitch, pump it up!

53:16.446 --> 53:17.739
Woohoohoo!

53:20.283 --> 53:21.910
What’s the worst
that could happen?

53:21.951 --> 53:23.870
Cheers to you being a cheeky
mother----ing bitch,

53:23.912 --> 53:26.081
but at least
you speak your mind.

53:26.122 --> 53:27.999
Kyle, you wanna make
a round of tequila shots?

53:30.543 --> 53:31.836
-You do it.
-You’re service.

53:31.878 --> 53:33.296
Natalia and Kyle’s
time management

53:33.338 --> 53:35.173
and priorities are
completely out of whack.

53:35.215 --> 53:37.676
You gotta get organized up
there, it’s driving me insane.

53:37.717 --> 53:39.386
It’s the last time
I’m saying it.

53:39.427 --> 53:42.347
Dude, if I ask for it to be put
away, I need it to be put away.

53:42.389 --> 53:43.682
There’s no slots in the locker.

53:43.723 --> 53:44.683
I don’t know what you
want me to do.

53:44.724 --> 53:46.309
I’m ----ing done.

53:46.351 --> 53:48.603
I’d like to put some sort
of lead position in my team.

53:48.645 --> 53:51.022
Both of you have
absolutely killed it.

53:53.066 --> 53:55.276
Like [bleep] you, I can do it,
I know I can do it.

53:55.318 --> 53:57.237
Go take five, go take five.

53:59.322 --> 54:00.865
Today’s the first day
that I actually

54:00.907 --> 54:02.200
released a little
bit of emotion.

54:02.242 --> 54:03.660
I didn’t ask for
anyone to come to me.

54:03.702 --> 54:05.954
Do you know what?

54:05.995 --> 54:08.081
Nat, she’s a complex creature.

54:11.376 --> 54:12.752
I can’t take you anymore.

54:12.794 --> 54:16.047
----ing hell, just get the
[bleep] out of my life.

54:16.089 --> 54:19.259
I think I struggle with
the thought of being alone.

54:19.300 --> 54:22.220
You’ve been abusing me for
so long, and I’ve held it.

54:22.262 --> 54:23.388
Kyle...

54:23.430 --> 54:25.056
If you and Kyle talk less
and work more,

54:25.098 --> 54:26.891
you’d actually be
ahead of the game.

54:26.933 --> 54:30.186
This has been waiting
to erupt for weeks.

54:30.228 --> 54:31.563
No, that’s...

54:31.604 --> 54:33.023
I’m telling you right now,
bring someone else in.

54:33.064 --> 54:34.899
And it’s finally erupted.

54:34.941 --> 54:36.943
We’re gonna be in a big swell.

54:39.529 --> 54:40.488
Oh!

54:40.530 --> 54:41.781
Twisted my ankle.

54:41.823 --> 54:43.533
-The jet-ski just flipped.
-[siren blaring]

54:43.575 --> 54:45.744
We’ve got the rescue boat here.

54:45.785 --> 54:46.745
Don’t manipulate me.

54:46.786 --> 54:48.121
That crosses a line with me.

54:48.163 --> 54:49.998
If you think you’re gonna
come for me like

54:50.040 --> 54:52.083
you come for everyone else,
you’re highly ----ing mistaken.

54:52.125 --> 54:54.002
You are also responsible
for the housekeeping.

54:54.044 --> 54:55.628
Don’t speak to me like that.

54:55.670 --> 54:57.380
I haven’t spoken to you
like any way, Tash.

54:57.422 --> 54:58.590
-No, don’t disrespect me.
-That’s just being ridiculous.

54:58.631 --> 54:59.924
I don’t stand for that.

55:02.552 --> 55:03.762
No.

55:07.349 --> 55:08.892
Ah!
