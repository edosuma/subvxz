WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.916
ROSSI: I'VE SEEN A LOT
OF GREAT AGENTS

00:03.960 --> 00:05.918
PASS THROUGH THOSE DOORS.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.094
YOU'VE REACHED
PENELOPE GARCIA

00:07.137 --> 00:08.704
AND THE FBI's OFFICE
OF SUPREME GENIUS.

00:08.747 --> 00:12.055
SPECIAL AGENT
JENNIFER JAREAU.
JJ IF YOU LIKE.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.059
THIS IS DR. REID.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.800
AGENT EMILY PRENTISS.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.149
IT'S AN HONOR,
AGENT ROSSI.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.455
PLEASE, JUST DAVE.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.760
HI, I'M TARA LEWIS.

00:21.804 --> 00:22.848
IT'S GREAT TO
OFFICIALLY MEET YOU.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.241
I'M SSA LUKE ALVEZ.

00:24.285 --> 00:25.808
THIS IS SSA MATT SIMMONS.HELLO.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.723
MOST OF THIS TEAM
HAS BEEN TOGETHER

00:27.766 --> 00:30.160
FOR OVER A DECADE.

00:30.204 --> 00:32.249
WE STAND BESIDE
ONE ANOTHER

00:32.293 --> 00:34.773
THROUGH GOOD,
THROUGH BAD,

00:34.817 --> 00:35.774
BECAUSE WE'RE FAMILY.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.254
SALUD.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.955
REID: PREVIOUSLY ON
"CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:42.999 --> 00:44.914
GARCIA:
THAT'S AGENT OWEN QUINN.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.307
HE WORKED HERE UNTIL
HE QUIT A YEAR AGO.

00:46.350 --> 00:47.699
ALVEZ: HE WAS CONVINCED
THERE WAS AN UNSUB WE MISSED

00:47.743 --> 00:49.353
WORKING UP AND DOWN
THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.833
HE NAMED HIM
THE STRANGLER.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.443
REID: THEO. YOU SAID
THAT HE TREATED YOU
LIKE A HUMAN.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.054
QUINN: HE WOULD
FEED ME SOMETIMES.

00:54.097 --> 00:56.099
YOU FOUND SOMETHING
THAT WE MISSED.
WHAT WAS IT?

00:56.143 --> 00:57.927
LEWIS: HYOID BONES.
THE STRANGLER REMOVED

00:57.970 --> 00:59.668
THESE FROM THE NECKS
OF HIS VICTIMS

00:59.711 --> 01:00.930
AND KEPT THEM AS TROPHIES.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.845
I'M SPECIAL AGENT
MEADOWS IN VICAP.

01:02.888 --> 01:05.500
I'VE HAVE AGENT QUINN'S
FILE ON THE STRANGLER
THAT YOU REQUESTED.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.111
REID: THEO KILLED
HIS OWN PARENTS.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.417
MY FATHER DIDN'T
KILL THEM.

01:09.460 --> 01:10.679
HE ABDUCTED THEM,
AND THEN HE HANDED

01:10.722 --> 01:12.246
THEM OVER TO
THE MESSIAH.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.900
DON'T YOU SEE,
THIS ISN'T ONE
SERIAL KILLER

01:14.944 --> 01:16.989
OR A COUPLE.
IT'S A CULT.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.469
PRENTISS:
BENJAMIN DAVID MERVA,

01:18.513 --> 01:20.906
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF 7 PEOPLE.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.170
MAYBE WE SOMEHOW MISREAD
QUINN ALL THIS TIME.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.736
WHAT IF THEY DID
CONVERT HIM?

01:24.780 --> 01:26.521
AND WE LEFT HIM IN
THE BUILDING

01:26.564 --> 01:29.306
WHERE THE MESSIAH IS
BEING HELD IN CUSTODY.

01:32.570 --> 01:33.876
DRAW YOUR GUN!

01:33.919 --> 01:38.185
MEADOWS. IT WAS MEADOWS.
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.882
MEADOWS: DROP YOUR GUN,
AGENT REID.

01:39.925 --> 01:42.014
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
GO UPSTAIRS AND FREE
MY MESSIAH.

01:42.058 --> 01:45.844
SPENCER, JUST SHOOT HER.
SHOOT HER!

01:49.457 --> 01:51.546
JUST KEEPS GOING
TO VOICEMAIL.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.808
ALL OF GARCIA'S CELLS?

01:52.851 --> 01:53.852
YEAH. I CAN'T GET
AHOLD OF HER.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.332
I TALKED TO SPENCE
FOR LIKE A SECOND

01:55.376 --> 01:56.290
BEFORE WE GOT DISCONNECTED.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.421
ALL RIGHT, TRY
THE GUARD GATE.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.859
STILL BUSY.
STILL BUSY?

02:00.903 --> 02:01.904
YEAH, IT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

02:01.947 --> 02:02.861
WE'VE GOT A PRISONER

02:02.905 --> 02:04.385
WHO COULD BE ESCAPING
RIGHT NOW.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.734
WE CAN'T GET ANYONE
ON THE PHONE.

02:05.777 --> 02:06.909
NOT EVEN SECURITY.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.954
MAYBE PRENTISS GOT
AHOLD OF THE DIRECTOR.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.695
YEAH, LET'S HOPE SO.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.175
THAT'S RIGHT,
BENJAMIN MERVA.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.569
HE'S BEING HELD IN
THE SIXTH FLOOR
INTERROGATION ROOM.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.875
I'M SORRY, WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:16.919 --> 02:18.964
GUYS.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.193
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

02:30.237 --> 02:31.847
IT'S A FIRE ALARM
ON THE SIXTH FLOOR, SIR.

02:31.890 --> 02:32.978
LEWIS: WHICH BUILDING?
YOURS.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.676
HOW MANY INJURED?
UNCLEAR.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.025
DIRECTOR ISN'T
TAKING CHANCES.

02:36.068 --> 02:37.505
THERE'S BEEN A
MANDATORY EVACUATION.

02:37.548 --> 02:39.898
WE HAVE A PRISONER
AWAITING TRANSFER--
BENJAMIN MERVA.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.987
I CAN'T LOOK IT UP.
SYSTEM'S DOWN.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.728
WELL, WE NEED TO
SEARCH EVERY VEHICLE,

02:43.772 --> 02:45.034
ESPECIALLY EMERGENCY ONES.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.644
I'VE GOT GUARDS
MANNING EXITS,

02:46.688 --> 02:47.993
BUT WE'RE
OUTNUMBERED.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.212
NO, WE'RE UNDER ATTACK.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.978
HEY. QUINN.
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.502
WE NEED ONE OF
THOSE AMBULANCES.

03:18.546 --> 03:21.244
HEY, WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU HELP, OK?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.203
JUST HANG IN THERE,
QUINN.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.999
RECORDED VOICE: PLEASE
EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.740
DO NOT USE ELEVATORS.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.829
MOVE AWAY FROM
THE BUILDING.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.879
PLEASE EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.925
DO NOT USE ELEVATORS.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.057
MOVE AWAY FROM
THE BUILDING.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.105
MERVA'S GONE.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.020
REID AND GARCIA?

03:58.063 --> 03:59.587
LEWIS: THEY COULD BE HELPING
WITH THE EVACUATION.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.458
QUINN AND HIS SON
ARE MISSING, TOO.

04:01.502 --> 04:05.506
SON'S NOWHERE IN SIGHT,
BUT QUINN'S IN THE GARAGE
SHOT IN THE GUT.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.944
WELL, IF HE DIDN'T
HELP THEM ESCAPE, WHO DID?

04:10.989 --> 04:13.557
I TOLD YOU WE'D DO IT.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.647
THEY'LL COME FOR HIM.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.519
AND FOR HER.
BUT IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.085
LET ME SEE.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.923
YOU'RE GONNA LET US
GO RIGHT NOW!

04:31.967 --> 04:34.186
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

05:01.083 --> 05:03.085
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC, AND CBS, INC.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.356
PRENTISS: "THE ONLY THING
NEW IN THE WORLD

05:13.400 --> 05:15.184
IS THE HISTORY YOU
DO NOT KNOW."

05:15.227 --> 05:16.925
HARRY TRUMAN.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.370
IS THAT
GARCIA'S CAR?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.241
YEAH.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.896
SPENCE AND PENELOPE'S
PHONES WERE LEFT INSIDE

05:31.940 --> 05:33.028
WITH THEIR BAGS.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.203
IF THEY WERE HELPING
WITH THE EVACUATION,

05:34.246 --> 05:35.465
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE
THOSE BEHIND.

05:35.509 --> 05:36.510
NO.

05:36.553 --> 05:37.859
OH, AND THAT.
SEE THAT?

05:37.902 --> 05:39.382
THAT'S QUINN'S BLOOD.

05:40.557 --> 05:46.041
BUT OVER HERE,

05:46.084 --> 05:47.956
I MEAN, WHOSE BLOOD
IS THIS?

05:47.999 --> 05:52.917
WHAT IF WHOEVER
TOOK MERVA

05:52.961 --> 05:55.355
HURT SPENCE OR PENELOPE?

05:57.095 --> 05:58.401
WE'LL FIND THEM.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.621
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.406
THERE'S NO FIRE,
NO SPRINKLERS.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.713
IT'S CLEARLY A FALSE ALARM.
SO WHY ALL THE CHAOS?

06:05.756 --> 06:06.975
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
WERE EVACUATED,

06:07.018 --> 06:08.411
SOME PANICKED,
FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.587
WAIT, HUNDREDS EVACUATED?

06:10.631 --> 06:11.936
REALLY, THIS LATE?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.808
IT'S CAMPUS WIDE
ALL THE BUILDINGS
WERE EMPTIED.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.070
NEW PROTOCOL,
APPARENTLY.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.899
OK, SO WHOEVER
PULLED THAT ALARM

06:17.942 --> 06:19.640
KNEW IT WOULD
CAUSE CHAOS.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.557
I SAID NO ONE LEAVES
WITHOUT A SEARCH.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.387
I KNOW IT'S LATE.
TELL HIM I'LL PAY
THE OVERTIME MYSELF.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.345
WELL, EVERYTHING'S
STILL OFFLINE.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.825
WHOEVER PULLED THE ALARM

06:30.868 --> 06:31.695
KNEW THE DIRECTOR'S
PROTOCOL

06:31.739 --> 06:32.870
AND USED IT AS
A DISTRACTION

06:32.914 --> 06:33.958
TO ESCAPE WITH MERVA.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.090
IF THEY TOOK
AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE,

06:35.133 --> 06:36.570
THEY CAN GET THROUGH
ANY ROADBLOCKS.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.788
WE NEED TO WIDEN
THE SEARCH.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.311
TRACK DOWN EVERY
AMBULANCE THAT RESPONDED.

06:39.355 --> 06:40.878
HE'S IN ONE OF THEM.
CALL THE COORDINATOR.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.967
I'LL SEE WHY WE'RE NOT
BACK ONLINE YET.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.466
MAN: FORKLIFT'S
OVER HERE.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.774
I UNDERESTIMATED HOW MUCH
HE CARES ABOUT YOU.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.819
HE'S GIVEN ME
EVERYTHING I NEED.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.691
BECAUSE WE'RE A FAMILY

07:10.734 --> 07:13.128
AND YOU DO ANYTHING
TO PROTECT THOSE YOU LOVE.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.783
FUNNY. YOU SAY THAT
AS IF I WOULDN'T KNOW.

07:15.826 --> 07:18.481
YOU'VE ABDUCTED US,
YOU'VE TRICKED
THE FBI FOR YEARS,

07:18.525 --> 07:20.527
AND YOU WORSHIP THAT
BENJAMIN MERVA GUY,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.964
SO I'M SORRY,
FORGIVE ME FOR THINKING
YOU WOULDN'T GET IT.

07:23.007 --> 07:26.228
I NEED YOUR HANDIWORK.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.539
LET ME SEE REID.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.409
HE ISN'T HERE.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.410
YES, HE IS.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.978
I WILL DIE
BEFORE I HELP YOU.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.033
ALVEZ: LISA.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.470
GSW's TO THE ABDOMEN.
HOW'S HIS BP?

07:50.513 --> 07:51.645
IT'S LOW.
HIS PULSE IS WEAK.

07:51.688 --> 07:52.994
HE'S IN AND OUT
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

07:53.037 --> 07:55.779
THEO IS JUST A BOY.
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

07:55.823 --> 07:56.737
WE'LL FIND THEO.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.087
NOW, IS HE WITH
REID AND GARCIA?

07:59.130 --> 08:01.002
THEY'RE GONE.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.352
MEADOWS CHECKED YOU OUT.
WHERE IS SHE?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.746
IT WAS ALWAYS HER.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.878
LISA: LUKE, WE'VE GOT
TO GET HIM INTO SURGERY.

08:07.922 --> 08:08.879
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN HE'S OUT.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.011
THANKS.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.752
GET OUT OF HERE.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.061
LEWIS.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.847
LEWIS: HEY, ROSSI.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.066
WELL, YOU CAN ADD
MEADOWS TO THAT.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.981
ALVEZ JUST CONFIRMED
SHE'S BEHIND THE ESCAPE.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.201
ROSSI: WHAT THE HELL
WAS SHE THINKING,

08:26.244 --> 08:29.160
ABDUCT FBI AGENTS
AND RUN FOR THE BORDER?

08:29.204 --> 08:31.815
WELL, THEY'RE COCKY,
MISSION-ORIENTED,
AND THEY HAVE HOSTAGES.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.034
MAYBE THEY THINK
WE'LL NEGOTIATE.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.557
WE'RE BACK ONLINE.
GARCIA'S COMPUTERS

08:34.601 --> 08:36.777
WERE HACKED BY SOMEONE
IN THIS BUILDING.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.000
WELL, MEADOWS WAS
IN THIS BUILDING.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.654
PRENTISS: AND SHE'S OUR
NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.700
WE NEED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.

08:46.743 --> 08:50.094
SO HOW LONG WAS MEADOWS
WITH BENJAMIN MERVA?

08:50.138 --> 08:52.183
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IF SHE'S IN A CULT,

08:52.227 --> 08:53.533
WE WON'T FIND
A PAPER TRAIL.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.187
SHE'S BEEN IN VICAP
FOR YEARS.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.015
MUST HAVE BEEN ONE
HELL OF AN INTERVIEW

08:58.059 --> 08:59.234
FOR HER TO TRICK
THE BUREAU.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.975
SHE CERTAINLY HAS
THE SKILLS AND CONNECTIONS

09:01.018 --> 09:02.280
TO PULL IT OFF.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.239
OK, HERE WE GO.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.546
SHE'S RUNNING
TO THE ELEVATOR.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.069
GARCIA WASN'T PART
OF THE PLAN.

09:08.112 --> 09:09.592
NO, BUT SHE IS NOW.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.377
GOT ANY CAMERAS ON
THE ELEVATORS
OR IN THE GARAGE?

09:13.422 --> 09:15.076
UH, THEY WERE DISABLED.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.560
OK, THERE'S REID.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.997
WHY IS HE RACING
DOWNSTAIRS?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.521
SEE, WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE GARAGE?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.045
THEY CAME UP,
GARCIA'S STILL DOWN THERE.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.236
ALVEZ: AND THERE'S THEO.

09:45.280 --> 09:49.197
REID SAID THE BELIEVERS
THINK THAT THEO IS
THEIR NEXT MESSIAH.

09:49.240 --> 09:53.114
YEAH, BUT THEO WANTED
NO PART OF THIS.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.290
HE KILLED HIS PARENTS.
HE TOLD US ABOUT THE CULT.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.118
NAH.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.688
REID MUST HAVE
CONVINCED MEADOWS

10:01.731 --> 10:03.385
THAT PULLING THE ALARM
WAS THE BEST DISTRACTION

10:03.428 --> 10:05.605
TO ESCAPE WITH THEO
AND MERVA.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.390
HE WANTED TO PREVENT HER
FROM SHOOTING ANYONE ELSE.

10:12.873 --> 10:16.485
REID KNEW WE'D FIND THIS.
LET'S GO BACK TO THE TOP.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.236
SO HE'S MAKING EYE CONTACT.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.195
BUT HE WOULDN'T RISK
SAYING ANYTHING.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.981
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
LOOK AT HIS HANDS.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.156
HE'S SIGNING.

10:35.199 --> 10:41.379
B-E-N-S-B-E-L-I-E-V-E-R-S.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.904
BEN'S BELIEVERS.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.340
HE ALREADY KNOWS
WE FIGURED THAT OUT.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.168
WHY'S HE REMINDING US?

10:49.953 --> 10:52.086
OK, GARCIA'S KEYCARD
WAS USED TO EXIT

10:52.129 --> 10:53.217
THE GARAGE AT 10:09 PM

10:53.261 --> 10:55.002
AND THEN REID'S
7 MINUTES AFTER THAT

10:55.045 --> 10:56.307
AND THEN MEADOWS'
AFTER THAT.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.831
SO SHE SEPARATED
ALL OF THEM.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.355
'CAUSE SHE HAD THE MANPOWER
OF AN ENTIRE CULT TO HELP HER.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.140
BUT OF ALL THE DEPARTMENTS,
WHY DID MEADOWS JOIN VICAP?

11:03.184 --> 11:05.795
IT'S A DESK JOB.
SHE NEVER HAD TO
PULL HER GUN

11:05.839 --> 11:07.318
OR ARREST ANYBODY.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.624
BUT WHAT I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT IS WHY

11:08.668 --> 11:10.713
SHE DIDN'T JUST
KEEP HER HEAD DOWN
ABOUT QUINN.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.194
SHE RISKED EXPOSURE BY
COMING TO MY OFFICE.

11:13.237 --> 11:16.240
UNSUB 101.
INSERTING HERSELF
INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.894
AND ALSO,
YOU'RE OUR LEADER

11:17.938 --> 11:19.504
AND SHE PROBABLY GOT OFF
KNOWING SHE TRICKED YOU.

11:19.548 --> 11:22.290
HOWEVER, SHE DID IMPROVISE
GARCIA'S ABDUCTION,

11:22.333 --> 11:25.597
WHICH MEANS THAT THIS
WHOLE THIS IS NOT AS SOLID
AS SHE WOULD HAVE HOPED.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.817
I'LL HAVE DAVE AND JJ
LOOK INTO HER WORK HISTORY.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.689
SHE WAS IN THE FBI
FOR A REASON.

11:44.268 --> 11:47.315
"WHY" IS AT THE HEART OF
EVERY BAU INVESTIGATION.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.751
THIS ONE ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.579
WHY DID MEADOWS
JOIN VICAP?

11:50.622 --> 11:54.191
EXACTLY. AS WE KNOW,
VICAP AGENTS LIAISON

11:54.235 --> 11:56.324
BETWEEN FEDERAL
AND LOCAL AGENCIES.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.719
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO PUT
TOGETHER DETAILS OF CRIMES

11:59.762 --> 12:01.851
THAT COULD BE CONNECTED
ACROSS THE U.S.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.461
THEN IT GETS ON
OUR RADAR.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.854
SO LET ME GUESS.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.464
MEADOWS HAS BEEN
ERASING MURDERS

12:06.508 --> 12:08.205
THAT WOULD HAVE CONNECTED
US TO THE CULT.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.730
WE HAD TO GO BACK
TO WHEN SHE JOINED

12:10.773 --> 12:12.775
AND REBUILD
HER CASE HISTORIES.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.430
WE FOUND A PATTERN
THAT SHE WAS HIDING.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.214
SO THE MURDERS
SHE WAS COVERING UP

12:17.258 --> 12:19.956
WERE THE ONES WHERE
THE VICTIMS WERE
MISSING HYOID BONES.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.479
LIKE THE 7 WE
FOUND IN STORAGE.

12:21.523 --> 12:26.180
AS IT TURNS OUT,
THIS CULT HAS KILLED
MORE THAN 7.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.355
HOW MANY?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.661
299.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.450
OH, MY GOD, IS HE--
YOU'RE REALLY HURT.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.455
WHAT

12:40.498 --> 12:42.631
ME.

12:42.674 --> 12:43.893
WHY

12:43.937 --> 12:45.982
I'D BE THEIR LAST VICTIM.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.810
WHAT

12:47.854 --> 12:50.857
I DON'T KNOW.
I OVERHEARD THEM.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.293
THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.034
I GAVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.253
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

12:56.297 --> 13:00.301
OR I'LL BLOW HIS BIG,
BEAUTIFUL BRAINS OUT.

13:13.705 --> 13:14.837
YEAH?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.360
THEY'VE GOT A FIREWALL,
SO THERE'S NO WAY

13:16.404 --> 13:17.709
TO WARN THE TEAM, BUT
THEY'RE COMING FOR US.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.015
YOU KNOW THEY ARE.
WE'RE GONNA BE OK.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.364
WE HAVE TO BE OK.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.626
WE'RE NOT GONNA
DIE HERE, SPENCER.

13:21.670 --> 13:22.889
THIS CAN'T BE HOW
OUR STORY ENDS.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.195
WHAT CAN WE DO?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.632
THEY'LL TRADE.
WE'LL MAKE A BARTER.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.983
TAKE ME.
NO.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.636
THE TEAM NEEDS YOU.

13:31.680 --> 13:32.899
NO, THEY DON'T.
THEY NEED YOU.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.509
THEY NEED US.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.076
WE NEED US.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.251
WHAT CAN WE DO?

13:37.294 --> 13:38.818
YOU'VE GOT ONE MINUTE.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.428
I HATE YOU.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.342
I DON'T CARE.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.822
GARCIA, LISTEN TO ME.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.740
PLEASE TELL MY MOM--

13:53.093 --> 13:55.095
THEY'RE TAKING ME AND THEO.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.357
THEO'S HERE?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.619
WE'LL DISTRACT THEM.

13:57.662 --> 13:58.925
THE CAR WE WERE IN IS
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.535
WE'RE 18 MINUTES
AWAY FROM QUANTICO.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.015
TURN LEFT OUTSIDE
THE PARKING LOT,
TAKE A RIGHT AT THE LIGHT.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.321
YOU'LL RECOGNIZE THE REST.
THEY STAYED OFF THE HIGHWAYS.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.583
OK, OK, BUT WHAT
ABOUT YOU?

14:05.627 --> 14:06.802
I'LL DELAY THEM.
GET THE REST OF THE TEAM

14:06.846 --> 14:07.847
BACK HERE AND DO NOT
WORRY ABOUT ME.

14:07.890 --> 14:08.891
MEADOWS: TIME'S UP.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.157
IT'S ALL HAPPENING.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.550
TEN TWENTY-THREE.

14:19.946 --> 14:23.906
GET TO IT. NOW.

14:27.344 --> 14:30.304
MA'AM, ALL
EMERGENCY VEHICLES
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED

14:30.347 --> 14:31.740
EXCEPT FOR ONE AMBULANCE

14:31.783 --> 14:33.655
THAT WASN'T REGISTERED
WITH THE CITY OR COUNTY.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.353
PRIVATE COMPANY SO WE CAN'T
TRACK THE GPS.
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.922
THANKS, ANDERSON.
KEEP ME POSTED.

14:39.966 --> 14:43.883
SIMMONS: I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT MEADOWS WAS ABLE
TO COVER UP ALL THESE KILLS.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.101
OVER A DECADE.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.929
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO
BE AN OBVIOUS PATTERN.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.975
THEY'RE ALL OVER
THE CONTINENTAL U.S.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.455
ALVEZ: VICTOMOLOGY'S
PROTECTOR TYPE.

14:51.499 --> 14:53.196
PRENTISS: THAT'S A GOOD
START, BUT WE NEED MORE.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.416
WHY TAKE HYOID BONES?

14:55.459 --> 14:56.460
WELL, THEY'RE UNIQUE
TO HUMANS,

14:56.504 --> 14:57.940
THEY FLOAT IN THE NECK,

14:57.984 --> 14:59.376
AND THEY AREN'T CONNECTED
TO ANY OTHER BONE.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.900
WELL, IT ANCHORS THE TONGUE.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.119
WITHOUT IT, THE VICTIMS
HAVE NO VOICE.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.729
RUN WITH THAT.

15:04.773 --> 15:06.775
THEY REMOVED THEM
WHILE THEIR VICTIMS
WERE STILL ALIVE,

15:06.818 --> 15:07.863
WHICH ISN'T JUST SADISTIC,

15:07.907 --> 15:09.734
IT MEANS THEY WANT
THEM SPEECHLESS.

15:09.778 --> 15:12.955
WHAT IF REMOVING
THE HYOID ISN'T
JUST A RITUAL,

15:12.999 --> 15:15.740
BUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S
SIGNATURE?

15:15.784 --> 15:19.048
SO IT ISN'T A CULT
OF KILLERS,

15:19.092 --> 15:21.007
IT'S JUST MERVA.

15:21.050 --> 15:24.010
ALL THE VICTIMS WERE
SACRIFICED BY THE MESSIAH.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.881
THE FOLLOWERS ARE
SIMPLY HUNTERS.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.101
THAT WOULD ELIMINATE
SOME OF HIS RISK.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.930
HE GAVE THE HUNTERS
HYOIDS AS TROPHIES,

15:30.973 --> 15:32.844
MAYBE AS SOME KIND OF
REWARD FOR THEIR HARD WORK.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.846
THAT'S WHY HE GAVE
THEO'S PARENTS 7 OF THEM.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.413
LEWIS:
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
THE BELIEVERS,

15:36.457 --> 15:37.980
THEY'RE JUST LIKE
JONESTOWN, MANSON,

15:38.024 --> 15:40.026
HEAVEN'S GATE, EVEN
RAJNEESHPURAM IN OREGON.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.942
THERE'S ALWAYS A
CHARISMATIC LEADER
AND A STRONG RIGHT HAND

15:42.985 --> 15:44.813
WHO APPEARS AS
A DEVOTED DISCIPLE.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.075
IN THIS CASE, MEADOWS.

15:46.119 --> 15:49.818
MERVA HAS KILLED
299 INNOCENTS
FOR A REASON.

15:49.861 --> 15:50.993
WE JUST DON'T
KNOW WHY.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.996
BUT NOW THAT HE'S
TAKEN REID AND GARCIA,

15:54.040 --> 15:56.564
THE BELIEVERS HAVE
DECLARED WAR ON THE BAU.

15:56.607 --> 16:00.002
SO THIS HAS GOT TO BE
WORKING TOWARD
THEIR END GAME,

16:00.046 --> 16:03.919
ONE THAT COULD MAKE
EITHER REID OR GARCIA
THEIR 300th VICTIM,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.268
PERHAPS THEIR LAST.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.791
GARCIA WASN'T A PART OF THIS.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.271
SHE WAS JUST RACING
TO THE ELEVATOR.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.751
SO IT'S SPENCE.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.013
IT'S BEEN HIM ALL ALONG.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.711
HE'S A PROTECTOR.
IT FITS THE VICTIMOLOGY.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.583
REID HAS TO KNOW
SOMETHING WE DON'T.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.455
BEN'S BELIEVERS.
REID COULD HAVE
TOLD US ANYTHING,

16:18.499 --> 16:20.240
BUT HE CHOSE THAT.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.852
GARCIA:
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.245
DIDN'T THINK YOU'D
BE SO JUDGY.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.290
IT'S GOOD VS. EVIL,
DUMMY.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.552
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

16:28.596 --> 16:31.991
DOING THE WRONG THING
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS,

16:32.034 --> 16:34.471
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
HURT REID OR ANYBODY ELSE.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.646
YOU'VE JUSTIFIED IT.

16:35.690 --> 16:36.778
I'M A PRETTY GOOD PERSON

16:36.821 --> 16:38.040
AND I'M DOING
A REALLY BAD THING.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.042
AGAIN, JUSTIFICATION.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
NOW THAT YOU'VE
MADE MY POINT,

16:42.001 --> 16:44.003
MAYBE YOU WON'T BE
SO QUICK TO JUDGE.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.270
WOMAN OF HER WORD.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.664
THE WORLD NEEDS MORE
OF US, AM I RIGHT?

16:53.708 --> 16:55.188
YOU NEED TO SINK
THAT RIGHT NOW

16:55.231 --> 16:57.233
OR IT WILL LOCK ME OUT
AND SET A BUNCH OF ALARMS

16:57.277 --> 16:58.974
IF I TRY TO HACK IT AGAIN.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.074
HEY.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.163
JJ: HI.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.079
AHEM.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.561
DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE REDSKINS GAME,

17:20.604 --> 17:23.999
GOSH, 14 YEARS AGO NOW?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.915
WELL, SPENCE--
SPENCE GOT US GOOD TICKETS.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.091
ACTUALLY, GIDEON
GAVE THEM TO HIM

17:29.135 --> 17:32.051
AND TALKED HIM INTO
ASKING ME TO GO.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.140
SO, YOU KNOW, I JUST FIGURED

17:34.183 --> 17:36.185
ALL THE YOUNGEST
TEAM MEMBERS SHOULD HANG OUT,

17:36.229 --> 17:41.321
SO I, OF COURSE,
ASKED GARCIA TO COME ALONG.

17:41.364 --> 17:45.064
UGH. WELL, IT TURNS OUT
MORGAN AND HOTCH WERE
GIVING HIM POINTERS

17:45.107 --> 17:48.110
ON THE SIDE THINKING
IT WAS GOING TO BE A DATE.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.679
GOSH. I MEAN, HE'D NEVER
BEEN ON ONE BEFORE.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.812
POOR SPENCE.
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.466
I'M JUST GLAD
HE FORGAVE ME.

17:56.510 --> 17:58.468
HE ADORES YOU.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.515
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT
WAS THE BEGINNING OF
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER.

18:01.558 --> 18:04.996
THE 3 OF YOU
HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE
SINCE I MET YOU.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.831
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO THIS WITHOUT THEM.

18:18.227 --> 18:21.448
IF, UH, WE CAN'T
GET THEM BACK I...

18:21.491 --> 18:23.102
IT'S OK.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.978
I KNOW.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.680
LEWIS: OK, THANKS.

18:36.724 --> 18:39.422
ALL RIGHT, I'VE
GOT METRO P.D. LOOKING
FOR ANY PROPERTIES

18:39.466 --> 18:41.772
OWNED OR RENTED BY
ANY AND ALL BENJAMINS
IN THE TRI-STATE AREA

18:41.816 --> 18:43.600
SINCE THE OLD WAREHOUSE
WAS COMPROMISED.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.950
THAT'S A GOOD CALL.
MEADOWS STAYED IN THIS
AREA TO BE NEAR MERVA.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.910
GET THIS.
BENJAMIN DAVID MERVA

18:48.953 --> 18:50.651
WAS BORN DAVID JAMES MERVA.

18:50.694 --> 18:53.523
I MEAN, IF HE WANTED
TO CREATE A NEW IDENTITY,

18:53.567 --> 18:56.352
WHY KEEP IT SO CLOSE
TO THE REAL NAME?

18:56.396 --> 18:58.963
WELL, ADDING AN OLD
TESTAMENT NAME LIKE BENJAMIN

18:59.007 --> 19:01.183
MAKES SENSE SINCE WE'RE
DEALING WITH A CULT.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.012
MEANS SON OF STRENGTH.
FITS HIS EGO.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.275
YEAH, BUT DAVID'S
A BIBLICAL NAME, TOO.

19:06.319 --> 19:09.148
SLAYER OF GOLIATH,
WENT ON TO BECOME KING.

19:09.191 --> 19:10.453
AND HIS GIVEN
MIDDLE NAME, JAMES,

19:10.497 --> 19:13.152
THAT'S PREVALENT IN
THE NEW TESTAMENT.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.197
SO THERE'S SOMETHING
SPECIFIC ABOUT
THE NAME BENJAMIN

19:15.241 --> 19:16.285
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.200
GUYS, HERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.898
THEO AND HIS PARENTS
LIVED OFF THE GRID

19:20.942 --> 19:23.118
IN COLORADO UNTIL '09,

19:23.162 --> 19:25.033
AND THEN THEY MOVED
TO VIRGINIA.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.253
LEWIS: BUT THERE'S
NO SCHOOL RECORDS

19:27.296 --> 19:29.168
FOR THEO IN COLORADO?

19:32.301 --> 19:35.913
NO. NO ADDRESS.
NO PHONE. NO JOBS.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.438
THERE'S NO ALTERNATE
IDENTITY FOR MARY MEADOWS,

19:38.481 --> 19:40.222
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS,

19:40.266 --> 19:43.573
THERE'S NO WAY THAT SHE
FAKED HER FBI FIRE ARMS
EXAMINATION,

19:43.617 --> 19:45.358
AND SHE NAILED IT
EVERY TIME,

19:45.401 --> 19:47.447
EVEN HER FIRST.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.623
SO SHE HAD A LOT
OF TRAINING.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.102
WAS SHE MILITARY?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.539
NO.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.758
NO, AND SHE DIDN'T GET
THAT KIND OF SKILL SET

19:54.802 --> 19:56.630
LIVING IN THE SUBURBS.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.155
SO HOW DID THE BUREAU MISS IT?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.202
BECAUSE WHOEVER MADE
THESE IDs KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

20:03.245 --> 20:06.248
YEAH. THESE IDs WERE
GOOD ENOUGH TO
FOOL THE GOVERNMENT.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.469
LIKE WITNESS PROTECTION GOOD?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.568
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

20:23.309 --> 20:25.920
WHEN WE HIT A WALL IN
THE QUINN INVESTIGATION,

20:25.963 --> 20:27.965
MEADOWS SHOWED UP
IN MY OFFICE.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.229
SHE CONVINCED ME QUINN
WASN'T A KILLER.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.361
UNSUB 101.

20:32.405 --> 20:36.713
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT IT WAS THE WAY
SHE STOOD THERE.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.282
SHE LINGERED.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.941
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
SHE WAS TESTING ME

20:46.984 --> 20:49.248
TO SEE IF
I RECOGNIZED HER.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.553
DID YOU?

20:50.597 --> 20:53.077
YEAH, FROM HERE, BUT

20:53.121 --> 20:56.298
I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE
OUR PATHS CROSSED.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.518
WHAT IF REID RECOGNIZED HER,

20:58.561 --> 21:00.868
AND THAT'S WHY HE SIGNED
"BEN'S BELIEVERS"?

21:00.911 --> 21:02.696
MAYBE SHE'S THE CONNECTION.

21:02.739 --> 21:07.309
CYRUS: MOTHERS, FATHERS,
CHILDREN,

21:07.353 --> 21:09.659
THOUGH WE WALK THROUGH
THE VALLEY

21:09.703 --> 21:12.358
OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH,
WE FEAR NO EVIL,

21:12.401 --> 21:14.751
FOR THOU ARE WITH US.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.406
OH, MY GOD.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.016
WHAT?

21:19.060 --> 21:20.801
I HAVE SEEN HER.
SO HAVE YOU.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.978
WE HAVE BOTH MET
THE BELIEVERS BEFORE.

21:25.066 --> 21:28.461
LIBERTY RANCH
IN COLORADO.

21:28.504 --> 21:31.202
POLYGAMOUS LEADER
BENJAMIN CYRUS.

21:31.246 --> 21:34.467
PLEASE, JUST PUT DOWN
YOUR GUNS AND COME OUT.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.382
WE'RE BELIEVERS, DAVE.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.384
WE BELIEVE THAT GOD
SAYS WHAT HE MEANS

21:38.427 --> 21:39.950
AND MEANS WHAT HE SAYS.

21:39.994 --> 21:43.127
HIS LAWS DON'T DEPEND ON
WHAT STATE YOU LIVE IN.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.651
I REMEMBER HIM.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.263
DAVE?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.395
I'M BEN.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.135
COME ON IN.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.456
PRENTISS: MERVA WAS THERE,
SO WAS MEADOWS.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.980
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
ONE OF CYRUS' WIVES.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.157
BEN'S BELIEVERS.

22:13.201 --> 22:16.378
BENJAMIN CYRUS
AND BENJAMIN MERVA
ARE CONNECTED.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.555
AND THIS IS THE PAYBACK
FOR CYRUS' DEATH.

22:19.599 --> 22:23.385
MERVA: THIS IS YOUR BATTLE.

22:23.429 --> 22:28.869
OK? LOYALTY IS EVERYTHING.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.958
THEY TOOK OUR...

22:31.001 --> 22:34.527
SOLAR PANELS, GUNS,
FOOD.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.529
YOU'LL BE OFF THE GRID.
JUST TAKE ME.

22:36.572 --> 22:37.965
LET THEO GO.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.401
THEO'S NOT A HOSTAGE.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.185
HE'S A DIVINE GIFT.

22:41.229 --> 22:42.752
HE WAS RAISED AT
THE RANCH TO BE A LEADER

22:42.796 --> 22:44.406
UNTIL YOUR TEAM
DESTROYED EVERYTHING.

22:44.450 --> 22:48.497
YOU DIDN'T STOP TO THINK
HOW THAT WOULD LOOK
A DECADE LATER,

22:48.541 --> 22:50.978
HOW THEO WAS FORCED
TO DEPEND ON HIS WEAK PARENTS.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.328
THEY WERE THE FOLLOWERS,
NOT THE LEADERS.

22:53.372 --> 22:57.680
AND YOU, NONE OF YOU
EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
US EVER AGAIN.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.900
YOU NEVER CONSIDERED
HOW ANGRY WE'D BE.

22:59.943 --> 23:03.251
YOUR GOVERNMENT
UNDERESTIMATED OUR FAITH.
NOW YOU'LL SEE.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.948
EVERYONE'S LOOKING
FOR US, AND THEY
AREN'T GONNA STOP.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.690
UNLIKE THE BAU, WE'VE
LEARNED FROM OUR MISTAKES.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.562
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS,

23:09.605 --> 23:11.433
NO ONE'S EVER
GONNA FIND YOU.

23:11.477 --> 23:14.218
CYRUS SAID GOD
WANTED TO SAVE ME.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.437
HE WAS RIGHT.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.440
HE SAVED YOU FOR
A GREATER PURPOSE,

23:18.484 --> 23:19.441
AND THIS IS IT.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.805
MEADOWS: STOP!

23:48.296 --> 23:50.211
WE'RE REMINDED OF
JIM McKAY'S WORDS
FROM MUNICH.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.213
"OUR GREATEST HOPES
AND OUR WORST FEARS
ARE SELDOM REALIZED."

23:58.872 --> 24:01.657
LIBERTY RANCH.
THIS CASE IS STILL
LEGENDARY

24:01.701 --> 24:03.311
FOR EXTREME
SURVIVALISTS.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.052
AND WHEN THE LOCAL
POLICE INVADED,

24:05.095 --> 24:07.794
THEY TOOK IT AS PROOF
THAT THE PROPHECY
HAD COME TRUE.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.273
POLYGAMY WAS HUGE FOR THEM.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.841
MEADOWS WASN'T THE ONLY
ONE MARRIED TO
BENJAMIN CYRUS.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.147
SO THEY BLAMED
THE BAU FOR THE DEATH

24:13.190 --> 24:14.844
OF THEIR MESSIAH
WAY BACK THEN.

24:14.888 --> 24:17.630
AND THEY'VE BEEN
PLANNING THEIR REVENGE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.632
THE TEAM WENT IN THERE
TO SAVE SOME KIDS FROM

24:19.675 --> 24:21.851
A SKETCHY SITUATION
A DECADE AGO,

24:21.895 --> 24:23.766
AND NOW THIS.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.899
AFTER THE EXPLOSION,
THE RANCH WAS CONDEMNED.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.727
LOCAL FBI HAS EYES
ON IT FOR US

24:27.770 --> 24:29.206
IN CASE THEY HEAD
BACK THERE.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.817
WHEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WERE RESCUED FROM THE RANCH,

24:30.860 --> 24:32.471
THE GOVERNMENT OFFERED
TO RELOCATE

24:32.514 --> 24:33.863
AND GIVE THEM A FRESH START
THROUGH WITSEC.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.604
THAT MAKES SENSE
WHY MEADOWS WAS ABLE

24:35.648 --> 24:37.301
TO CLEAR THE FBI
BACKGROUND CHECK.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.956
SHE ACCEPTED THEIR HELP
KNOWING SHE WOULD
BETRAY THE GOVERNMENT.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.741
NOT EVERY SURVIVOR
WANTED HELP.

24:41.784 --> 24:44.352
WE RAN THOSE
WHO LEFT THE RANCH
AND KEPT THEIR NAMES.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.920
A FEW RELOCATED IN RURAL
MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.399
WELL, THEY COULD BE
HELPING NOW.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.401
ANY OF THEM HAVE LARGE
PIECES OF PROPERTY?

24:50.445 --> 24:52.273
A FEW. THE WASHINGTON
FIELD OFFICE

24:52.316 --> 24:53.753
HAS STARTED SEARCHES
IN MARYLAND.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.058
WE'LL TAKE THE LEAD
IN VIRGINIA.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.408
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU HURT?

24:57.452 --> 25:00.107
IT'S A WAREHOUSE THAT'S
IN HILLCREST, 18 MINUTES.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.717
I CAN TAKE YOU THERE.
YOU GOT TO HURRY.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.066
THEY HURT REID.
HE'S BEEN BLEEDING.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.242
THEY'RE IN TRUCKS
WITH THEO.
I HEARD A GUNSHOT.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.635
IT'S A WAREHOUSE.

26:08.131 --> 26:12.048
YOU'VE BEEN TESTED
SINCE WE LAST SAW YOU.

26:12.092 --> 26:16.052
LOCKED AWAY WITH THOSE
YOU'VE BEEN CHASING.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.838
YOU COME OUT OF THAT
DIFFERENT.

26:18.881 --> 26:22.102
I KNOW YOU WERE FOND OF THEO.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.452
HE WAS YOUR STUDENT
AND TRUSTED YOU.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.674
BUT HE BETRAYED US,

26:28.717 --> 26:32.025
AND LOYALTY IS EVERYTHING.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.696
WE'VE GOT TEAMS SEARCHING
CONCENTRIC CIRCLES

26:50.739 --> 26:52.219
OUT TO A 20-MILE RADIUS.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.568
THAT'S GOOD.
THERE'S A CHANCE
THEY'RE GONNA LAY LOW

26:53.612 --> 26:55.091
INSTEAD OF RISKING GETTING
ON THE ROAD RIGHT AWAY.

26:55.135 --> 26:58.138
YOU KNOW, I HATE
TO SAY IT, BUT
FOR A SECOND,

26:58.181 --> 27:00.967
I THOUGHT THEO
MIGHT HAVE COUNTED
AS OUR 300th.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.143
THEY DIDN'T TAKE
HIS HYOID.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.018
REID SAID IT ALL
HAPPENS AT 10:23.

27:09.062 --> 27:11.107
BUT IT'S PAST THAT.SO WHAT DID HE MEAN?

27:11.151 --> 27:12.369
COULD BE A CLUE HERE.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.633
THEY GOT SLOPPY SINCE
THEY LEFT IN A HURRY.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.199
JJ: OK, WELL, YOU CAN'T
BE THAT FAR BEHIND THEM.

27:16.243 --> 27:19.507
I KNOW, BUT THERE'S
EASY ACCESS TO
3 MAJOR HIGHWAYS,

27:19.550 --> 27:21.030
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHICH WAY THEY WENT.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.684
RIGHT, BUT THEY'RE
IN TRACTOR TRAILERS.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.208
THAT MEANS WE CAN TRACK
THEM THROUGH WEIGH STATIONS.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.688
NO, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.689
WHY?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.822
I HACKED THE AVI,

27:29.865 --> 27:31.214
THE AUTOMATED VEHICLE ID,

27:31.258 --> 27:33.086
AND CREATED CLEAN
HISTORIES FOR EACH
OF THE TRUCKS

27:33.129 --> 27:35.262
SO THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE TO STOP.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.091
SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE
WITHIN THE LEGAL WEIGHT,

27:38.134 --> 27:39.222
THEY'D GET A GREEN LIGHT.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.876
I DID THAT.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.443
I WANTED TO SEE REID
SO I DID THAT.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.879
I DID THE WRONG THING.

27:43.923 --> 27:44.967
PRENTISS: BUT THERE'S
GOT TO BE A WAY TO TRACE

27:45.011 --> 27:47.056
AN ELECTRONIC WEIGH
STATION BYPASS.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.102
THEY'RE TRANSPONDERS,
LIKE A CARPOOL LANE.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.233
EACH ONE IS ASSIGNED--

27:50.277 --> 27:51.713
NO, NO, YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.715
I USED OLD REGISTRATIONS,
NOTHING LEGIT.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.065
IT'S ALL UNTRACEABLE.
I TRIED TO LEAVE A TRAIL,

27:56.109 --> 27:58.067
BUT I COULDN'T.
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH TIME.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.069
THIS IS MY FAULT.
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO FIND REID IN TIME,

28:00.113 --> 28:01.288
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.376
PENELOPE, IT'S GONNA BE OK.

28:02.419 --> 28:03.856
HOW IS IT GONNA BE OK?
THEY KILLED THEO

28:03.899 --> 28:05.205
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.990
LOOK, THEY'VE BEEN GONE
LESS THAN AN HOUR.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.688
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THEY'RE STILL IN VIRGINIA.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.179
CYRUS: EVERYONE DRINKS,

28:23.223 --> 28:25.399
EVERYONE REJOICES,

28:25.442 --> 28:31.144
'CAUSE TODAY WE ARE
ONE STEP CLOSER.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.425
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

28:51.468 --> 28:53.427
MULTIPLE ROUTES THEY
COULD TAKE OUT OF STATE.

28:53.470 --> 28:56.299
BASED ON THE SIZE OF
THE TRUCK GARCIA DESCRIBED,

28:56.343 --> 28:58.954
WE'RE TALKING TWO FUEL TANKS
FILLED WITH DIESEL.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.870
THOSE TANKS COULD BE
ANYWHERE FROM
50 TO 300 GALLONS,

29:01.914 --> 29:04.568
AND THEY GET ROUGHLY
7 MILES A GALLON AVERAGE.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.440
SIMMONS: YEAH, WE'RE LOOKING
AT 1,200 TO 1,800 MILES

29:06.483 --> 29:07.702
BEFORE THEY NEED TO REFUEL.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.225
THEY WON'T WANT
TO RISK STOPPING.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.313
THEY'LL STAY INSIDE
THAT RADIUS.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.750
THEY'RE USING TRUCKS
FOR TRANSPORT

29:11.793 --> 29:13.229
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE SUPPLIES,

29:13.273 --> 29:14.578
SO THEY'RE SETTING
UP A NEW COMPOUND.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.276
AGREED.
BUT WHERE?

29:16.319 --> 29:18.626
WHERE WILL THEY BE
AT 10:23?

29:18.669 --> 29:21.760
WELL, 500 MILES
IN ANY DIRECTION.

29:21.803 --> 29:26.373
OHIO, NEW YORK,
MASSACHUSETTS,
GEORGIA, KENTUCKY.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.201
ONLY CONNECTION
BETWEEN THOSE STATES

29:28.244 --> 29:29.855
IS THAT THERE WERE
VICTIMS KILLED THERE.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.378
EMOTIONAL HISTORY'S
IN COLORADO,

29:31.421 --> 29:33.423
BUT THAT WOULDN'T CONNECT
TO 10:23 AT ALL.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.686
BUT THEY CAN MAKE IT TO
THE RANCH WITHOUT REFUELING.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.166
IT'S TOO RISKY.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.951
THEY KNOW IT'S
THE FIRST PLACE
WE'D LOOK.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.691
I

29:40.735 --> 29:44.043
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHY THEY'D WANT TO
KILL 300 VICTIMS?

29:44.086 --> 29:46.523
IT FEELS LIKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.397
CYRUS WAS
A HISTORY BUFF.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.747
HE CHOSE FRANKLIN
AS HIS MIDDLE NAME

29:52.791 --> 29:54.314
AFTER A FOUNDING
FATHER.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.403
300's A RECURRING
NUMBER IN HISTORY.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.840
SPARTAN'S GUARD OF
THE KING, IT WAS 300 MEN.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.668
300 INVISIBLE
SOLDIERS OF GIDEON.

30:00.711 --> 30:02.322
COINCIDENCE?

30:02.365 --> 30:04.977
GIDEON WAS NO LONGER
ON THE TEAM WHEN WE
WERE AT THE RANCH.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.543
IT COULD BE
CONNECTED, BUT--

30:06.587 --> 30:09.198
IF THIS IS ABOUT
A BELIEVER'S REBIRTH,

30:09.242 --> 30:11.244
BABIES ARE BORN
WITH 300 BONES,

30:11.287 --> 30:13.463
AND THEY'RE TAKING
THE HYOIDS.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.552
AND THE HYOIDS WE
HAD IN EVIDENCE
ARE MISSING,

30:15.596 --> 30:17.424
WHICH MEANS MERVA
NEEDED THEM BACK.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.426
AND THAT MEANS THEY MEAN
MORE TO THE END GAME
THAN WE THOUGHT.

30:19.469 --> 30:22.777
BUT WHY DID REID NEED US
TO KNOW IT ALL HAPPENS AT 10:23?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.648
THAT'S GOT TO BE IMPORTANT.
IT WAS THE LAST THING
HE SAID TO ME.

30:24.692 --> 30:27.260
LISTEN, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT MEANS SOMETHING TO HIM.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.391
WE'RE TRYING TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.002
YOU BETTER.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.404
REID: I CAN'T TELL YOU
THE NUMBER OF TIMES

30:41.448 --> 30:44.799
I'VE INVESTIGATED ABUSE
CHARGES AGAINST SMALL
RELIGIOUS GROUPS.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.757
ALMOST ALL OF THEM
TURN OUT TO BE FALSE.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.237
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT?

30:48.281 --> 30:49.760
IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER WHAT I THINK.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.284
IT DOES TO ME.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.241
WHY?

30:52.285 --> 30:54.243
BECAUSE GOD WANTS
TO SAVE YOU.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.332
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
HE SENT YOU HERE.
THAT'S THE REASON.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.160
MEADOWS: REID.

30:58.204 --> 30:59.901
REID.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.208
HE'S IGNORING US.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.705
WAIT, WAIT.

31:21.749 --> 31:22.968
THEY'LL STOP LOOKING
FOR ME IF I TELL THEM TO,

31:23.011 --> 31:24.317
BUT YOU HAVE TO
LET ME TALK TO THEM.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.362
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THEY'LL STOP?

31:26.406 --> 31:27.798
I KNOW THEY WILL,

31:27.842 --> 31:29.888
IF I TELL THEM I'M SAFE
AND IT'S ALL GONNA BE OK.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.367
YOU THINK YOU'RE SAFE,

31:31.411 --> 31:34.849
EVEN THOUGH, JUST THEN,
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA DIE?

31:34.893 --> 31:38.200
TELL ME, WHAT DID YOU FEEL?

31:38.244 --> 31:39.898
PEACE.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.945
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.991
HOLD ON TO THAT.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.867
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT,

31:52.911 --> 31:56.001
BECAUSE THIS WAS
JUST A TEST.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.786
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

31:58.829 --> 32:02.746
STILL NO SIGN OF ANY PREP
AT THE OLD LIBERTY RANCH
OR NEARBY.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.705
WELL, IF THIS IS
ABOUT REBIRTH,

32:04.748 --> 32:05.749
THEY'LL CHOOSE
A NEW PLACE.

32:05.793 --> 32:06.881
WELL, GIVEN THEIR
ADORATION OF CYRUS

32:06.925 --> 32:08.491
AND HIS LOVE OF
THE COUNTRY,

32:08.535 --> 32:10.102
HE'D WANT THEM TO STAY
WITHIN OUR BORDERS.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.973
REMEMBER, BENJAMIN CYRUS
WASN'T HIS REAL NAME,

32:12.017 --> 32:13.801
AND HE WASN'T BORN
INTO THE CULT.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.934
HE AND HIS MOM ARRIVED
THERE WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.197
HE WAS KICKED OUT
FOR MOLESTING GIRLS.

32:18.240 --> 32:22.766
AND THEN HE SERVED TIME
IN PRISON IN KENTUCKY.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.507
GARCIA: CHARLES MULGREW,
CONVICTED IN KENTUCKY

32:24.551 --> 32:26.770
AT THE AGE OF 18,
3 COUNTS STATUTORY RAPE.

32:26.814 --> 32:28.947
MR. KENTUCKY WARDEN
SAID THAT ONCE INSIDE

32:28.990 --> 32:31.427
MULGREW FOUND RELIGION,
BECAME A MODEL CITIZEN.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.908
THIS GUY VOLUNTEERED
AT THE PRISON HOSPITAL
AT THE AIDS WARD.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.779
HE WAS READING TO PRISONERS
DYING OF HIV.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.694
HE WAS A MODEL CITIZEN.

32:40.219 --> 32:44.353
SO HE WAS TECHNICALLY
REBORN IN KENTUCKY,
AND THAT'S IN THE AREA.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.485
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE HEADED?

32:45.528 --> 32:47.182
LET'S FIND OUT WHICH
CITY HE WAS BORN IN

32:47.226 --> 32:49.097
OR WHERE HE WAS IN
PRISON AND WE'LL SPREAD
OUT FROM THERE.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.012
GREAT WORK, GARCIA.
WE'LL GET IN THE AIR,

32:51.056 --> 32:52.840
NARROW DOWN WHICH CITY
BEFORE WE LAND.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.798
WE SHOULD ALSO CIRCLE BACK
TO THE RELIGIOUS COMPONENT

32:54.842 --> 32:56.365
THAT CYRUS BROUGHT
TO THE CULT.

32:56.409 --> 32:59.629
REID AND CYRUS QUOTED
SCRIPTURE A LOT.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.154
10:23 COULD BE A LESSON.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.515
MEADOWS:
YOU CLAIM TO FEEL PEACE,

33:15.558 --> 33:19.258
BUT YOU'VE CHOSEN
A PATH THAT SURROUNDS
YOU WITH VIOLENCE.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.824
I MEAN, I GET IT.

33:20.868 --> 33:24.437
CLOCK'S TICKING
AND YOUR TEAM STILL
HASN'T FOUND YOU YET.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.048
YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO HOLD ON TO.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.791
JJ: THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.055
WILL AND I WERE TALKING
AND...

33:34.099 --> 33:36.710
WE WANT YOU TO BE
HENRY'S GODFATHER.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.366
I DON'T EVEN KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW--

33:40.409 --> 33:41.367
HERE, DO YOU WANT
TO HOLD HIM?

33:41.410 --> 33:43.064
UM.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.370
IT'S OK.
THERE YOU GO.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.198
OK.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.764
HI.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.853
THERE YOU GO.HELLO, HENRY.

33:49.897 --> 33:51.768
NOW, IF ANYTHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO US,

33:51.812 --> 33:53.857
IT'S UP TO YOU AND GARCIA
TO MAKE SURE THIS BOY

33:53.901 --> 33:55.033
GETS INTO YALE.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.687
OOH, YALE. YALE.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.820
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO YALE, HENRY?

33:59.863 --> 34:03.171
THAT WAS YOUR GODFATHER'S
SAFETY SCHOOL.

34:03.215 --> 34:06.566
DON'T WORRY, I CAN
GET YOU INTO CALTECH
WITH ONE PHONE CALL.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.785
HEH.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.544
WE'RE APPROACHING KENTUCKY.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.372
THE PILOT NEEDS TO KNOW
WHERE TO TOUCH DOWN.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.591
WE'RE STILL LOOKING.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.114
SIMMONS:
UH, PROVERBS 10:23.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.247
"A FOOL FINDS PLEASURE
IN WICKED SCHEMES,

34:35.290 --> 34:37.379
BUT A PERSON
OF UNDERSTANDING
DELIGHTS IN WISDOM."

34:37.423 --> 34:38.554
DOESN'T FIT.

34:38.598 --> 34:39.947
JEREMIAH 10:23.

34:39.990 --> 34:42.993
"I KNOW THAT
THE WAY OF MAN IS
NOT IN HIMSELF."

34:43.037 --> 34:45.126
CORINTHIANS.
"DO ALSO THE GLORY OF GOD."

34:45.170 --> 34:46.823
UH, HEY, GUYS,
LISTEN TO THIS.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.869
MATTHEW CHAPTER 10,
VERSE 23.

34:48.912 --> 34:52.525
"WHEN YOU ARE PERSECUTED
IN ONE PLACE, FLEE TO ANOTHER."

34:52.568 --> 34:54.483
THEY'RE GOING TO
THE NEXT TOWN.

34:54.527 --> 34:55.919
FLEE TO ANOTHER,
BUT WHICH ONE?

34:55.963 --> 34:58.922
THEIR END GAME IS
ALSO A NEW BEGINNING.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.011
CYRUS BROUGHT RELIGION
BACK TO THE CULT.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.362
THEY'D HONOR THAT BY
WANTING TO START FRESH,

35:03.405 --> 35:05.103
LIKE THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

35:05.146 --> 35:08.149
THAT'S HOW 300 FITS.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.586
THAT WAS THE NUMBER
OF ANGELS THAT PROTECTED
THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.153
ARE THERE ANY EDENS
IN KENTUCKY?

35:12.197 --> 35:14.460
UH, NO.

35:14.503 --> 35:17.158
BUT THERE ARE TWO SYNONYMS,
CANAAN AND ARCADIA.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.812
WHICH ONE'S CLOSER TO
WHERE CYRUS WAS BORN?

35:18.855 --> 35:20.074
ARCADIA.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.858
OK, THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.557
GARCIA, PULL LAND DEEDS.
I'LL NOTIFY SWAT.

35:33.261 --> 35:36.699
"AND NOW THESE
3 REMAIN--

35:36.743 --> 35:38.658
"FAITH, HOPE, AND LOVE.

35:38.701 --> 35:41.182
BUT THE GREATEST
OF THESE IS LOVE."

35:41.226 --> 35:43.184
CORINTHIANS.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.446
FAITH IN YOUR NEW BEGINNING.

35:44.490 --> 35:45.926
THE 300 WHO PROTECT EDEN.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.014
THAT'S WHY YOU CHOSE
YOUR VICTIMS.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.581
VICTIMS?
THEY'RE OUR ANGELS.

35:48.624 --> 35:51.845
THEY WERE PROTECTORS,
BUT YOU SEE ME AS YOUR ENEMY.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.326
NO, WE SEE YOU AS
THE BRAVEST OF THEM ALL.

35:54.369 --> 35:57.764
DURING THE RAID,
CYRUS GAVE YOU MANY
CHANCES TO LEAVE,

35:57.807 --> 36:00.288
BUT YOU CHOSE TO
STAND BESIDE HIM.

36:00.332 --> 36:03.204
HE ADMIRED YOU,
AND HE TOLD US SO.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.075
HE DIDN'T SEE YOU
AS THE OTHERS.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.773
HE SAW YOU AS
A GREAT ONE.

36:06.816 --> 36:10.168
THAT'S WHY GOD CHOSE
YOU TO SURVIVE.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.213
SHE BLAMES ME
FOR CYRUS' DEATH.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.520
SHE HAS TO BLAME
SOMEONE.

36:14.563 --> 36:18.219
GRIEF CONSUMES HER
WITHOUT IT.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.916
SO THIS ISN'T REVENGE?

36:19.960 --> 36:22.354
WE AREN'T MONSTERS.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.536
MERVA:
BEFORE WE TAKE HIS
VOICE AS OUR OWN...

36:31.798 --> 36:33.626
HE HAS SOMETHING
TO SHARE.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.980
TO EVERY THING,
THERE'S A SEASON.

36:42.025 --> 36:46.726
AND A TIME TO EVERY
PURPOSE UNDER THE HEAVEN...

36:50.643 --> 36:55.169
A TIME TO BE BORN
AND A TIME TO DIE...

36:58.041 --> 37:03.264
A TIME TO WEEP

37:03.308 --> 37:08.269
AND A TIME TO PLUCK UP
THAT WHICH HAS BEEN PLANTED.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.358
MEADOWS: OK, HE'S STALLING.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

37:11.751 --> 37:15.363
MERVA: ALL RIGHT,
LET THE SACRIFICE BEGIN.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.844
PROTECT US FROM ALL HARM.

37:17.887 --> 37:20.281
BELIEVERS: LET THE
SACRIFICE BEGIN.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.631
PROTECT US FROM
ALL HARM.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.243
LET THE SACRIFICE BEGIN.

37:25.286 --> 37:28.115
PROTECT US FROM ALL HARM.

37:28.158 --> 37:30.117
MERVA: TODAY WE GIVE
THANKS FOR OUR PATIENCE,

37:30.160 --> 37:32.206
PERSEVERANCE, AND STRENGTH.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.296
WITHOUT THESE, OUR
EFFORTS WOULD HAVE FAILED.

37:35.340 --> 37:39.735
AND WE THANK THE OTHERS
WHO HAVE SACRIFICED FOR US.

37:39.779 --> 37:42.303
BELIEVERS: THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SACRIFICE.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.174
AND FOR OUR GUARDIAN,

37:44.218 --> 37:47.526
WHO WILL PROTECT THIS
FAMILY NOW AND ALWAYS.

37:47.569 --> 37:52.226
SPENCER, KEEPER OF PROVISIONS...

37:53.401 --> 37:55.621
YOU ARE GIVEN
SELFLESSLY TO OTHERS

37:55.664 --> 37:58.363
AND WILL BE REWARDED
BY THE HIGHEST HONOR

37:58.406 --> 38:00.147
WE COULD BESTOW.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.280
YOUR BLOOD WILL BE
OUR BLOOD.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.456
YOUR LIFE WILL FUEL OURS.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.112
GO, NOW!
DOWN!

38:14.030 --> 38:15.118
MERVA!

38:27.392 --> 38:29.045
MAN: BACK UP, BACK UP.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.743
LAY ON THE GROUND.
