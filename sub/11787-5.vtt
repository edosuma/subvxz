You sure this is what you want?

32:51.928 --> 32:54.761
He's a blip, a rounding error.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.798
I could kill him
and no one would notice.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.304
That's the difference
between you and me, Percy.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.095

we had a security breach.

I got us covered here, man, okay?

35:00.599 --> 35:01.930

so it's only a slap on the wrist.

with the recruits.

I'll take responsibility.
