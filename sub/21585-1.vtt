00:16.058 --> 00:18.227
All right, so Baker
is stumbling through the house,

00:18.436 --> 00:19.479
pushing us out of his way,

00:19.687 --> 00:20.897
trying to get down
to the basement.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.648
- God!
- So the cops see him,

00:22.857 --> 00:24.650
and they're like,
"Excuse me, sir,

00:24.859 --> 00:27.278
can you put down the keg?"

00:27.487 --> 00:29.572
And I-- At this point,
I'm like,

00:29.780 --> 00:32.700
"I want nothing to do
with this situation."

00:32.909 --> 00:34.827
- Uh-huh.
- So I back out of the situation.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.497
I'm just-- I'm watching it
from a mile away.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.165
And it's all great.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.416
Asshole.

00:42.335 --> 00:44.003
So...

00:44.212 --> 00:46.130
So one of the cops
comes up to Baker,

00:46.339 --> 00:49.008
and he goes to grab him,
Baker flips a switch.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.969
He's like, "Don't touch me,
you pig fucking piece of shit!

00:52.178 --> 00:53.930
"L'm not gonna take this
shit from you.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.223
"You can arrest me
right now.

00:55.431 --> 00:56.599
"L'm not losing
this fucking keg.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.351
I'm not losing
my fucking deposit!"

00:58.559 --> 01:00.186
- Oh, my God.
- They tackle him to the ground.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.021
He breaks his nose,
and then he gets arrested.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.814
Well, yeah, but did he get
his deposit?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.733
- No. He didn't get his deposit.
- Joey!

01:05.942 --> 01:08.152
You keyed my fucking car,
faggot.

01:08.361 --> 01:09.904
Get off of him!

01:10.112 --> 01:11.572
What the fuck?

01:15.826 --> 01:19.247
Hey! Break it up!
Get off him! Get up!

01:20.915 --> 01:22.375
Fucking pussy!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.126
Fuck you, man!

01:24.335 --> 01:26.295
You're lucky
you didn't break his nose.

01:26.504 --> 01:27.713
Yeah?

01:27.922 --> 01:30.550
Because, you know,

01:30.758 --> 01:33.344
I thought he was
the lucky one.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.056
So, Joey,
did you key his car?

01:39.100 --> 01:41.394
Yeah, nobody saw me do it.

01:41.602 --> 01:45.481
Trevor has had a grudge on me
ever since...

01:45.690 --> 01:47.441
this has to be
between me and you,

01:47.650 --> 01:50.403
...ever since I stuck my tongue
down his girlfriend's throat.

01:53.990 --> 01:55.116
Keep it up, J09)!-

01:55.324 --> 01:57.326
You know he punched me.

01:57.535 --> 02:00.371
So this whole thing
is bullshit.

02:00.580 --> 02:03.207
Mr. Hunt's just itching
to kick you out.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.965
Joey, you are so fucking cool.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.219
Come on, really.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.223
Is this who
you want to be?

03:15.029 --> 03:16.614
How safe
is your drinking water?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.492
<i>Many people are asking
that question</i>

03:19.700 --> 03:20.743
<i>after the state fined
Westford--</i>

03:20.951 --> 03:22.203
- Hey.
- Hey, zombies.

03:24.205 --> 03:26.499
Come on, Joey.
We were watching that.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.876
Come on, Dad's not
coming home tonight,

03:29.085 --> 03:33.381
so you two have the pleasure
of cooking dinner with moi.

03:33.589 --> 03:34.632
Pleasure?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.717
Dad's never home.

03:36.926 --> 03:40.429
How do you think
he pays for this TV

03:40.638 --> 03:42.556
or the bed you two
sleep in?

03:42.765 --> 03:44.350
Hm?

03:44.558 --> 03:45.893
Come on.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.937
- Come on, we're cooking dinner.
- No...

03:48.145 --> 03:49.313
We gotta make some dinner!

03:49.522 --> 03:51.607
We're gonna make
some dinner.

03:51.816 --> 03:54.276
We're gonna make some dinner.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.161
We got to get that elevated.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.248

Oh, let's take
a look.

Oh!

05:39.507 --> 05:41.008
Good.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.301
Cw!

05:42.510 --> 05:44.595
Jesus fucking Christ!

05:44.804 --> 05:46.847
Hey, hey, hey,
keep your voice down.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.266
I got-- I got children.

05:49.475 --> 05:50.726
I think we're gonna
have to operate.

05:50.935 --> 05:52.770
I think we have to operate.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.240
Ah.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.874
Evening, Melissa.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.668
How's your night going,
Ritchie?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.127
Oh, poker night,
always good for me.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.172
I bet.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.675
You been playing down
on Norwalk Street?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.219
I don't follow.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.556
A construction site got ripped
off a few hours ago.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.475
It seems like the German
Shepherd got someone good.

06:31.684 --> 06:34.562
Well, I'm in tree removal,
not construction.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.982
How's business?

06:38.190 --> 06:40.609
- Booming?
- Does it look like it's booming?

06:40.818 --> 06:43.529
Ah! I'm out.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.239
I got him good.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.740
Son of a bitch busted me
on the river

06:46.949 --> 06:47.992
with an inside straight.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.577
When did you get
released?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.662
Me? I've been out awhile.

06:51.871 --> 06:53.497
Good behavior, baby.

06:53.706 --> 06:56.125
Shit, if we'd known
you were coming by,

06:56.333 --> 06:57.501
we could have made it
strip poker.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.545
Hey. Come on.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.297
God, you're pathetic.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.633
Well, it is getting late,
so unless you got a warrant...

07:04.842 --> 07:07.052
Yeah, I think if I came back
with a warrant,

07:07.261 --> 07:09.513
you boys would be playing cards
for cigarettes.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.517
Good one.

07:13.726 --> 07:15.895
Okay, you drive safe.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.022
Keep your hands 10 and 2
on the steering wheel.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.273
Mm-hmm.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.861
Bitch.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.279
Sexy bitch.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.156
Right?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.657
Let's go put one on Keegan.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.536
Yeah, yeah.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.769
Hey!

07:56.977 --> 07:59.021
Are you shooting my tree?

08:01.065 --> 08:03.859
There's a million other
goddamn trees out here.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.945
There is my tree.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.324
You gotta have respect
for something

08:10.532 --> 08:12.242
that's been around
that long.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.827
- Yeah, I know.
- You know?

08:17.247 --> 08:18.958
{gun P0ps]

08:19.166 --> 08:20.292
Good shot.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.173
You have plans tonight?

08:26.382 --> 08:27.633
Yeah.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.343
Cancel them.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.261
Dad, I can't.
I've canceled on Allyson--

08:32.471 --> 08:33.681
You're coming out
with us tonight.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.557
Don't wet yourself.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.518
Keegan got his ass bit off
as shit.

08:37.726 --> 08:38.769
Paughs]

08:40.562 --> 08:43.941
You'll be in the cold,
keeping watch.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.317
All right?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.737
Oh, yeah,
call the babysitter.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.679
Yo, Joey.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.305
It's good.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.808
Dude, you knocked
Trevor out, bro.

09:18.017 --> 09:20.978
I caught the whole fucking
thing. Look at this shit.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.521
Yo, put that shit away.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.525
What the hell's
wrong with you?

09:26.734 --> 09:27.818
Jeez...

09:42.374 --> 09:44.334
Where are
you going?

09:44.543 --> 09:45.961
I gotta go
to the bathroom.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.963
You can wait
until 9:30.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.674
I'm literally
about to shit my pants.

09:50.883 --> 09:53.594
You're gonna be responsible
for this shit

09:53.802 --> 09:55.095
all over this floor.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.805
Stop laughing.
I'm serious.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.099
I am leaking.

09:59.308 --> 10:01.518
- Joey, all right, sit down.
- I have to shit my pants so bad,

10:01.727 --> 10:03.270
I'm about to flip
this table.

10:03.479 --> 10:06.482
All right, please stop saying,
"I have to shit my pants."

10:06.690 --> 10:08.275
Just say, "I need to use
the bathroom."

10:08.484 --> 10:12.112
Okay. I really have
to use the bathroom.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.574
You're unbelievable.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.950
<i>30h</i>

10:21.580 --> 10:23.123
You're disgusting.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.292
I can't believe they let you
get away with that.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.836
Yeah, they can't wait
for me to graduate.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.756
Yeah, if you graduate.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.592
Oh, no, I got my shit
on lockdown.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.470
You are the one
that I worry about.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.896
Someone's excited.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.564
I'm off tonight.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.650
What do you wanna do?

10:55.322 --> 10:58.742
Dude, tell your dad
to watch those kids for once.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.119
Yeah.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.620
No, that's who
I'm hanging with.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.705
We're gonna do
family stuff.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.250
What family stuff are you
gonna do with your dad?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.544
I don't know.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.129
Gonna drink beers,

11:10.337 --> 11:12.589
watch a couple movies,
something like that.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.093
Fine. If you wanna hang out
with your dad,

11:16.301 --> 11:18.971
maybe I'll let
Morgan Silerino take me out.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.100
Whoa. Oh, no,
I don't want that.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.726
All right...

11:26.228 --> 11:27.646
Friday night,

11:27.855 --> 11:29.231
when you get off work,

11:29.439 --> 11:30.649
I'll come pick you up

11:30.858 --> 11:32.442
and I'll take you
to that Mexican restaurant

11:32.651 --> 11:34.153
that you love so much.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.823
SefiormMexican name.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.325
It's Sefior Pepe's, racist.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.327
Paughs]

11:42.536 --> 11:44.329
There's soda
in the fridge if you want any.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.747
Cool.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.709
Make sure
these two liars

11:48.917 --> 11:51.211
are in bed by 9:00 p.m.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.589
And they are not allowed
to watch the 10:00 p.m. news,

11:53.797 --> 11:56.133
no matter what
they tell you.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.802
Are you still
dating that girl?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.764
Make sure they're in bed
by 9:00.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.350
Later, brats.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.655
Ah, the entertainment's here.

12:18.864 --> 12:20.699
Start with me, miss.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.826
- Yeah, if you had a dick.
- Oh!

12:23.035 --> 12:25.162
You punk-ass bitch.
Aw, look at you.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.916
Oh, what's going on,
little cousin?

12:29.124 --> 12:32.169
You're part of the crew now,
huh? Goddamn.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.880
How many high school bitches you
hitting, huh? Got any for me?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.673
Glad I'm not part
of this family.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.926
Sure, you are. Your wife didn't
tell you about me and her?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.260
- Oh!
- All right, listen,

12:40.469 --> 12:41.762
-the babysitter here?
- Yeah.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.222
Okay, do we need her
for these guys?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.514
Oh...

12:44.723 --> 12:45.849
All right, listen,

12:46.058 --> 12:47.267
my son's coming out
with us tonight,

12:47.476 --> 12:48.602
so let's tighten it up,

12:48.810 --> 12:50.020
not act like a bunch
of jerk-offs.

12:50.229 --> 12:51.438
- Real professionals.
- That's right.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.106
Grab a seat, pull it up.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.948
Tonight, Joseph,
we will be taking our talents

13:01.156 --> 13:03.575
to Main Street Antiques,

13:03.784 --> 13:06.411
where their inventory features
more than a few fine items,

13:06.620 --> 13:08.497
but none worth
mentioning more

13:08.705 --> 13:11.333
than an incredibly rare
set of coins.

13:11.541 --> 13:12.709
- Coins?
- Oh, yeah, coins.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.378
But not just any coins.
These-

13:14.586 --> 13:15.671
What about an alarm?

13:15.879 --> 13:16.964
All right, Joe,
don't worry.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.715
We got that covered.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.217
You're gonna keep
alookouL

13:20.425 --> 13:23.136
keep a lookout for
if you see a cop car,

13:23.345 --> 13:24.554
late-night 109995

13:24.763 --> 13:26.431
a little forest critter
or anything.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.141
You let us know.
Got it?

13:29.351 --> 13:31.061
Okay.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.063
Channel 2.

13:33.272 --> 13:34.398
When I was up in Winslow,

13:34.606 --> 13:35.816
there were these two guys.

13:36.024 --> 13:40.529
Fucking identical twins,
real ugly, mean as shit.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.991
One of the brothers was always
reminding the other brother

13:44.199 --> 13:45.909
that he was
three minutes older.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.661
They fight like kids still.

13:47.869 --> 13:51.540
So, the older brother, he starts
banging one of the chick hacks.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.083
She's about like
a one and a half,

13:53.292 --> 13:55.210
but in prison
that's a fucking 7, believe me.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.255
The younger brother, he catches
wind of all this shit,

13:58.463 --> 14:00.257
he decides that he wants in
on the action.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.634
Why not make it
a family affair, you know?

14:02.843 --> 14:05.929
So he pulls it off.
He starts fucking banging her.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.765
Maybe she couldn't
tell the difference.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.101
Yeah, they might be different
by a couple minutes,

14:11.310 --> 14:13.979
but the inches
are probably the same.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.565
Anyways, some asshole ends up
telling the older one

14:16.773 --> 14:19.151
that they're both
getting water at the same well.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.029
So, the older one,
he's smart about it.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.531
The next day,
the younger brother,

14:24.740 --> 14:25.699
he's taking a shower.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.159
It's going well.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.410
Water pressure's good.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.370
Hasn't dropped
the soap.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.789
He goes to shampoo.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.542
Suddenly this guy just starts
fucking screaming out.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.712
"Fuck! Ow!
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

14:38.920 --> 14:40.464
It burns!"

14:40.672 --> 14:44.551
The older brother had put bleach
in his shampoo.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.094
Paughs]

14:46.303 --> 14:48.263
He nearly went blind
in his right eye

14:48.472 --> 14:51.600
and it burnt the skin
right off his dick.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.477
Paughs]

14:53.685 --> 14:55.645
She could tell the difference
between them after that.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.628
Joe, head around the back.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.565
Nice.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.929
Four, one, nine, nine, eight.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.222
Ah.

16:12.431 --> 16:15.517
One, nine, nine...

16:20.021 --> 16:21.398
She probably left out "pound."

16:21.606 --> 16:23.650
Four, one, nine, nine, eight.

16:23.859 --> 16:24.901
Got it.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.780
- What the fuck is this?
- You got to record.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.115
Orange key.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.869
After you.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.912
Holy shit.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.665
There they are.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.935
Someone's coming.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.721
- We 're clear.
- Let's get started.

17:34.930 --> 17:37.682
Keegan, man...goddamn.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.434
- What a dick.
- Fuck it.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.627
Holy shit, you scared
the shit out of me.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.672
Wait, you're friends
with my son, Brendan.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.758
Hey, yeah. Jeremy.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.469
Jimmy?

18:17.013 --> 18:18.515
Have one.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.100
No, thanks.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.191
What are you doing out here
anyway?

18:28.400 --> 18:30.443
I was going for a walk.

18:30.652 --> 18:31.945
What about you?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.825
That's my shop.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.995
Piece of shit.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.413
My wife kicked me out again.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.622
Joe.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.624
Do you copy?
How you doing out there?

18:46.251 --> 18:47.836
<i>Joe?</i>

18:49.379 --> 18:50.672
<i>Do you copy, Joe?
Do you copy?</i>

18:50.880 --> 18:53.091
What did you say you were doing
out here?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.926
Joe, do you copy?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.305
You think
I'm stupid?

18:58.513 --> 19:00.307
FUCK you!

19:00.515 --> 19:02.142
Get the fuck
off me, man!

19:02.350 --> 19:03.977
You punks think you can rob me?

19:04.185 --> 19:05.228
Hey!

19:08.773 --> 19:10.150
Come on, just fucking
chill out.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.779
Chill out! Relax.
Relax, man.

19:23.872 --> 19:24.956
No, don't...

19:26.625 --> 19:27.792
I know who you are.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.420
Don't I?

19:30.629 --> 19:33.256
I know who you are.

19:33.465 --> 19:35.383
- Shut up.
- I know-- I know who you are.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.760
I know who all of you are!

19:50.482 --> 19:51.775
Where's Britt? What happened?

19:51.983 --> 19:53.276
- Where's Britt?
- Uh...

19:53.485 --> 19:54.778
- Rich! Rich!
- Stay here.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.946
Bring the car around, now.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.365
Stay here.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.234
Come on.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.695
What is that?

22:05.909 --> 22:07.744
Turn it off.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.205
Turn it off.
Turn it off.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.624
Turn it off.
Turn the fucking thing off!

22:24.469 --> 22:26.846
Get it out.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.224
You guys put everything
back where it was, right?

22:29.432 --> 22:30.892
You guys wore gloves, right?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.270
Let's go.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.818
Joe, check the pockets.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.987
What? No.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.424
A wallet?

23:24.028 --> 23:25.822
What if someone
fishes here?

23:29.701 --> 23:31.286
For frogs?

24:08.656 --> 24:10.950
- Hey.
- You're late.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.328
- How much is it?
- Well, it would have been $20,

24:13.536 --> 24:16.164
but I was here for an extra
hour and a half.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.042
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.627
Just so you know,
Blake hit Chrissy

24:20.835 --> 24:22.378
and she tried
to scratch his face.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.213
Great.

24:24.422 --> 24:25.465
Are you all right?

24:25.673 --> 24:27.133
Yeah, I'm fine.

24:27.342 --> 24:28.426
Good night.

24:28.635 --> 24:29.677
Good night.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.153
The kids will be up soon.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.616
- You knew this guy?
- Yeah.

26:17.618 --> 26:20.079
I used to be friends
with his son.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.915
The police will come
looking for him.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.253
People disappear
all the time.

26:30.506 --> 26:31.632
Dad...

26:34.385 --> 26:35.553
now, I was thinking...

26:37.263 --> 26:39.057
what if we told them
what happened?

26:40.349 --> 26:42.602
You know,
he attacked us.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.604
Oh.

26:44.812 --> 26:49.609
You mean like we go on down
to the precinct and we say,

26:49.817 --> 26:54.113
"Look, we were knocking
over this antique store

26:54.322 --> 26:58.076
"and, you know,
the owner caught us doing it,

26:58.284 --> 27:00.369
so things got out of hand."

27:02.538 --> 27:04.415
This isn't high school.

27:04.624 --> 27:08.169
You don't get to weasel your way
out of it with the teacher.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.720
We just go along...

27:20.348 --> 27:22.725
<i>...like we did before.</i>

27:22.934 --> 27:25.103
<i>Now I got to look after
these two clowns.</i>

27:25.311 --> 27:27.063
<i>I need you to be my rock.</i>

27:28.648 --> 27:30.274
<i>Will you do that?</i>

27:31.526 --> 27:33.277
Yeah.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.695
Good.

27:41.285 --> 27:43.287
<i>Winter Dance
tickets may be purchased</i>

27:43.496 --> 27:45.998
<i>from Mrs. Galenson
in the main office.</i>

28:01.472 --> 28:03.015
Hey,gang.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.477
Sorry I'm late.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.312
What are you guys doing?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.232
How close?

28:17.405 --> 28:19.115
If you guys want,
you can send it to me tonight

28:19.323 --> 28:20.533
and I'll go over it.

28:20.741 --> 28:21.909
Cool?

30:23.990 --> 30:25.574
It just doesn't make any sense,

30:25.783 --> 30:28.494
just that you fucking said it.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.454
It doesn't just happen...

30:30.663 --> 30:31.664
Home early?

30:31.872 --> 30:33.332
Party got canceled.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.835
Huh, you had to drive
all that way?

30:36.043 --> 30:38.754
They could have let you know
beforehand,

30:38.963 --> 30:41.132
-show a little courtesy.
- Yeah, it wasn't too bad.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.844
Tara, this is my little cousin,
Joey.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.180
Hey.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.599
Hi.

30:50.808 --> 30:53.811
He's cute, but he's got
a tiny pecker.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.689
Runs in the family.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.195
Come on.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.785
She knows.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.747
She gave us the code
for the alarm.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.586
Her and the owner?

31:18.794 --> 31:20.129
Yeah.

31:21.922 --> 31:24.008
He was seeing her
on the side.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.344
You said we were the only four
that knew.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.220
She's a good kid.

31:28.429 --> 31:31.098
Her and Britt have known
each other forever.

31:31.307 --> 31:33.309
Britt's friends
don't mean shit.

31:36.437 --> 31:37.730
Why didn't you tell me
about her?

31:37.938 --> 31:40.649
I told you what you
needed to know.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.654
Seems like a lot of people
are needing to know.

31:45.863 --> 31:46.906
Joe...

31:47.114 --> 31:48.282
JOe!

31:48.491 --> 31:49.825
Can't afford to make
any more mistakes.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.286
Glad you finally decided
to look out for us.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.747
Hey.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.166
Some trees are gonna fall.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.711
The important thing
is they don't fall on our house.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.380
Okay?

32:04.006 --> 32:05.591
Come on in
and have a beer.

32:08.344 --> 32:09.470
Come on.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.601
I gotta go check
on the kids first.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.645
All right, come back,
I want you here.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.292
You avoiding me?

32:41.710 --> 32:44.463
Relax, I got sick.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.382
You couldn't even text?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.218
And my phone died.

32:49.427 --> 32:50.678
Fuck you, Joey.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.847
I'm not stupid.
Something happened.

32:53.055 --> 32:54.598
You think I'm lying
to you?

32:54.807 --> 32:56.434
I texted you,
like, 20 times.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.519
Where were you?

33:00.896 --> 33:03.065
Joey, are you listening?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.152
Babe...

33:06.360 --> 33:08.112
I'm sick of this shit.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.698
Just tell me the truth.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.533
Allyson, come on,
what are you--?

33:12.741 --> 33:13.993
You're lying.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.163
Please don't--
Don't do this right now.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.415
Fucking douche.

33:41.896 --> 33:43.481
Fuck you...

33:43.689 --> 33:45.107
Where's your daddy, buddy? Huh?

33:45.316 --> 33:46.901
- Where'd he go?
- Brendan, step back.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.652
Go find your
daddy, little bitch!

33:48.861 --> 33:50.654
Hey, come on, come
on, Brendan, Brendan.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.031
No, it's not cool.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.491
Fuck, be cool!

33:53.699 --> 33:54.909
Hey!

33:55.117 --> 33:56.494
What the fuck?
Fucking pussy.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.538
Hey, man...it's not worth it.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.499
What the fuck's you guys'
problems, man?

34:01.707 --> 34:02.875
Get the fuck
out of here.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.794
Keep running your fucking mouth.
Yeah, yeah.

34:06.003 --> 34:07.254
Come on.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.172
Fuck yOU, Quys-

34:09.380 --> 34:10.966
You all right?

34:11.175 --> 34:13.092
I didn't need
your help, man.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.097
Paughs]

34:17.306 --> 34:19.391
What's so funny?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.226
Nothing.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.271
You don't think I can fight?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.023
I used to wrestle you every day
after school.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.274
I know you can't.

34:28.943 --> 34:30.694
Whatever, man.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.446
Hey.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.406
Hey, Brendan,
I was just joking.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.369
I feel bad for you, man.

35:01.809 --> 35:03.727
Sometimes shit
looks like a mess,

35:03.936 --> 35:05.646
but there's really
an order to it.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.777
Keegan couldn't make it, huh?

35:11.986 --> 35:13.779
I heard a mutt
got a hold of him.

35:15.406 --> 35:16.824
Yeah, no,
he'll be all right.

35:17.032 --> 35:18.534
I'll tell him
you asked that.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.705
I'll give you 500
for the lot.

35:22.913 --> 35:24.498
Paughs]

35:24.707 --> 35:26.709
Don't break our balls.

35:26.917 --> 35:31.046
First off, half of them
are engraved.

35:31.255 --> 35:32.881
Huh?

35:33.090 --> 35:34.675
Can't sell them online.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.344
There's three PCD
tipped Pergo blades in there.

35:37.553 --> 35:38.762
Barely been used.

35:38.971 --> 35:41.098
Your dick's barely
been used.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.975
It don't mean
it's worth something.

35:43.183 --> 35:45.978
Okay, all right,
500 it is, Stick.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.362
See?

35:55.571 --> 35:56.989
Everything has its place.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.907
No more fucking around.

35:59.116 --> 36:02.036
Now...the coins.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.622
Where are they?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.290
I ain't got them.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.085
What?

36:10.294 --> 36:13.297
I got somebody lined up
for these.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.341
Yeah, we had to cancel.

36:15.549 --> 36:18.135
- And?
- And nothing.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.554
And that's what you're gonna
tell anyone who asks.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.402
What do I see from this?

36:35.611 --> 36:37.655
Shit. That's what.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.282
Fine by me.

36:40.491 --> 36:41.992
You look like a gambler.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.119
Why don't you go
fuck yourself,

36:44.328 --> 36:46.330
grease-monkey motherfucker.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.748
- Hey, chill.
- No, fuck you, man.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.249
- Hey!
- I'm fucking tired of your bul--

36:49.458 --> 36:51.669
What are you gonna do?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.754
Stick, what are you
looking for?

36:57.508 --> 36:59.885
Just talk to me.
What are you looking for?

37:02.721 --> 37:05.349
Trying to figure out
what all this is worth.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.310
The tools...

37:08.519 --> 37:09.770
they're yours.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.271
You can keep them.

37:12.940 --> 37:17.027
Opie thinks I want
a bag of tools.

37:17.236 --> 37:20.406
Joe, go wait outside.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.950
Now.

37:32.835 --> 37:35.045
You actually trust
that guy?

37:35.254 --> 37:36.880
Sticky knows
what's good for him.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.527
We got a 586 vehicle

37:58.736 --> 38:02.823
<i>parked in a permitted zone,
registered to Gregory Carlson.</i>

38:03.031 --> 38:04.283
Hey, Melissa.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.576
How's it going out there?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.077
Cold.

38:07.286 --> 38:08.787
How's the search for Greg going?

38:08.996 --> 38:10.414
Still looking for him?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.541
Or are you guys back
to running speed traps as usual?

38:12.750 --> 38:14.710
We were hoping
to find him in one,

38:14.918 --> 38:17.629
but this morning a Statie
found his car

38:17.838 --> 38:19.173
parked out by the train station.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.133
He probably
outsmarted all of us.

38:21.341 --> 38:24.219
Took off somewhere
a lot warmer than here.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.444
Pump one, please.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.779
Hey, Joey.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.572
You know it's cheaper
at the Shell, right?

39:27.407 --> 39:29.952
But it's good to support
local businesses, I guess.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.204
Brendan, I'm kind of busy
right now. What do you want?

39:32.412 --> 39:34.331
The other day, man...

39:36.917 --> 39:39.169
I was just really fired up,
and I hate those guys.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.756
And thanks.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.592
Yeah, man,
don't mention it.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.097
- Hey, is that Joey?
- Yeah.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.224
Well, ask him over for dinner.

39:52.432 --> 39:54.434
Brendan, ask him over
for dinner.

39:56.687 --> 39:57.938
Hey.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.690
My mom saw you at school
the other day,

39:59.898 --> 40:02.401
and told me to ask you if you
want to come over for dinner.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.903
Uh, I would love to,
but I gotta, you know,

40:05.112 --> 40:06.280
feed the kids tonight, so--

40:08.240 --> 40:09.533
All right, man, it's cool.
I just--

40:09.741 --> 40:10.784
Yeah, I just thought
I'd ask.

40:15.622 --> 40:16.748
Hi.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.092
Okay, here we go.

40:27.301 --> 40:30.429
I hope everybody likes
asparagus, yeah.

40:30.637 --> 40:31.722
Oh, damn it.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.473
It's okay.

40:33.682 --> 40:35.559
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay, it's okay.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.185
Brendan, let me have your plate,
please.

40:37.394 --> 40:38.562
Thank you.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.731
- Joey, asparagus?
- Uh, yes, please.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.316
Okay, good.

40:42.524 --> 40:43.901
There you go.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.903
So...

40:46.111 --> 40:48.947
what do you do
with yourself nowadays, Joey?

40:49.156 --> 40:51.617
It seems like
you haven't been over since...

40:51.825 --> 40:52.910
since you boys
were at Truman.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.037
Yeah. Yeah, it's been a bit.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.165
I remember when you guys
were little,

40:58.373 --> 41:00.083
we couldn't pull you away

41:00.292 --> 41:02.669
from that big screen TV
in our playroom.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.296
You remember that, Brendan?

41:04.504 --> 41:05.547
Paughs]

41:05.756 --> 41:07.132
Yeah, you guys
had cable.

41:07.341 --> 41:08.550
Oh, is that what it was?

41:08.759 --> 41:10.761
Well, we're glad to have you.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.388
You looking at colleges?

41:13.597 --> 41:16.600
Oh, no, no,
I'm not right now.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.602
Well, you should really
get started.

41:18.810 --> 41:19.853
There is a lot to consider.

41:21.229 --> 41:22.564
Paughs]

41:22.773 --> 41:25.692
Yeah, I don't know if it's...

41:25.901 --> 41:27.903
if it's for me.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.822
So, I noticed
that you smoke.

41:31.031 --> 41:33.408
- Mom, come on.
- What?

41:33.617 --> 41:35.285
Joey?

41:36.787 --> 41:39.122
Yeah. Yeah, I...

41:39.331 --> 41:40.666
I do.

41:40.874 --> 41:42.209
My cousin Britt
got me--

41:42.417 --> 41:44.294
Uh-huh, well,
I think you should quit.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.880
You know, it's very bad
for your health.

41:47.089 --> 41:50.008
I will, for you,
Mrs. Carlson.

41:50.217 --> 41:52.386
Glad to hear that.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.555
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.228
Hello?

42:01.436 --> 42:03.230
Yes, hi, detective.

42:06.566 --> 42:07.734
No, it's not late.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.528
We actually just sat down
to dinner.

42:11.613 --> 42:12.781
Yes.

42:12.990 --> 42:15.784
Let me know
if you hear from him.

42:38.598 --> 42:39.725
Well...

42:41.059 --> 42:43.228
so, where were we?

42:43.437 --> 42:45.230
Remember we used to built
those snow forts?

42:45.439 --> 42:48.025
Yeah. The neighbors
never stood a chance.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.486
- The Creeleys.
- Oh, the Creeleys.

42:51.695 --> 42:53.155
Whatever happened
to them?

42:53.363 --> 42:54.573
Private school.

42:54.781 --> 42:55.991
Of course.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.367
- Right?
- Yeah.

42:57.576 --> 42:58.827
Big surprise.

43:07.085 --> 43:11.798
You ever get the feeling that
everybody's talking about you?

43:12.966 --> 43:14.301
I mean, all the time.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.554
You heard about my dad,
right?

43:21.641 --> 43:25.687
Just ever since he took off,
it's just...

43:25.896 --> 43:27.939
everybody.

43:28.148 --> 43:32.152
I just want to punch them
in the the fucking face.

43:33.528 --> 43:35.197
Yeah, I usually do.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.367
And how do you feel
about it?

43:39.576 --> 43:40.786
Good.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.621
Yeah, I bet.

43:49.169 --> 43:51.838
She really thinks
he's coming back.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.219
You don't?

43:57.427 --> 43:58.845
No.

44:00.931 --> 44:04.434
I mean, he hasn't answered
a single phone call.

44:04.643 --> 44:07.062
He hasn't even tried
to call us back.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.776
Doesn't really seem like
he wants to be found.

44:21.827 --> 44:23.703
"We, the lowdown fools.

44:25.122 --> 44:26.665
We the lowdown fools."

44:26.873 --> 44:28.333
What are you doing,
Joey?

44:53.316 --> 44:54.818
Did you see that?

45:11.459 --> 45:12.878
Paughs]

45:17.174 --> 45:19.092
Shit.

45:19.301 --> 45:20.468
Fuck.

45:20.677 --> 45:23.680
Man, we thought
that was so cool.

45:23.889 --> 45:25.515
It wasn't?

45:33.148 --> 45:37.861
Man, why do you always have to
act like such a dick at school?

45:38.069 --> 45:39.613
What?

45:41.364 --> 45:43.909
You just got this, like,
tough guy routine, you know?

45:46.411 --> 45:49.539
Just, I know you, man.
You're a really good guy.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.088
Ah.

45:57.297 --> 45:58.465
No, I'm not.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.091
Yeah, you are.

46:00.300 --> 46:01.593
I'm not.

46:01.801 --> 46:03.678
- You really are.
- I'm not!

46:14.356 --> 46:17.484
Shit, now I'm gonna have
that stupid song

46:17.692 --> 46:18.860
stuck in my head all night.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.619
- Mothertruckin'?
- Yeah, that's right.

46:27.827 --> 46:29.329
- I changed that.
- Why did you change that?

46:29.537 --> 46:30.622
Because I'm
the better rapper

46:30.830 --> 46:32.249
and I make the executive
decisions.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.042
Yeah, that's true.
You are the better rapper.

46:34.251 --> 46:36.378
Yeah, and you're
kind of just like P. Diddy.

46:36.586 --> 46:38.588
I'm like Notorious B.l.G.
and you're P. Diddy.

46:38.797 --> 46:41.591
Oh, fuck that,
you are not Notorious B.I.G.

46:46.221 --> 46:47.722
Get up, zombies.

46:49.057 --> 46:51.893
Goddamn it, Joey.
Get off me.

46:52.102 --> 46:53.895
Get up.

46:54.104 --> 46:56.731
Get out of my bed.
Come on.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.608
Brush your teeth.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.736
Don't hit each other,

47:01.945 --> 47:04.698
and I'll read you
a bedtime story.

47:04.906 --> 47:08.618
And then the Fire Queen kissed
the Ice King on the mouth,

47:08.827 --> 47:11.663
with tongue,
and melted his heart.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.208
And then they died.

47:15.417 --> 47:16.626
No, they didn't die.

47:16.835 --> 47:18.086
They didn't die.

47:18.295 --> 47:20.547
All right, sleep tight, guys.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.340
Let the bedbugs bite.

47:26.136 --> 47:27.804
No mercy. No mercy, Rich.

47:28.013 --> 47:29.055
Hey!

47:31.016 --> 47:33.810
You should have got home
way earlier.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.520
We had gimpy here
bring over

47:35.729 --> 47:38.898
some of his brother-in-law's
moonshine.

47:39.107 --> 47:40.358
One sip left.

47:40.567 --> 47:42.736
Ah. Yours.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.321
It's yours.

47:45.613 --> 47:46.990
Big chug!

47:48.783 --> 47:51.328
He's drunk already.

47:51.536 --> 47:55.040
He ain't chucked it up yet.
Huh?

47:55.248 --> 47:56.833
- Hey..
- Up.

47:57.042 --> 47:59.753
...to the Southfield Police,

47:59.961 --> 48:04.549
may they be slow on their toes
and heavy on their feet.

48:04.758 --> 48:10.263
May they forever doze
on our quiet Main Street.

48:36.164 --> 48:37.665
Yeah, let's go!

48:42.462 --> 48:44.672
- Brendan! Go!
- Go, go, go!

48:51.096 --> 48:52.347
Oh!

48:52.555 --> 48:53.723
Oh, shit.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.982
Yeah, man,
I yak after every race.

49:03.191 --> 49:05.026
Man, that's torture.

49:05.235 --> 49:07.987
Yeah, it's a little gross,
but you know, I always win.

49:08.196 --> 49:09.948
Oh, yeah? You took fourth.

49:10.156 --> 49:11.741
Good enough for me.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.618
I'd cough up a
lung if I ran like that.

49:13.827 --> 49:15.620
You know, you should really
stop smoking, man.

49:15.829 --> 49:17.080
It's not a good look.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.082
Yeah, I know.

49:20.375 --> 49:23.545
Really,
you should stop.

49:23.753 --> 49:24.796
What are you, your mom?

49:25.004 --> 49:26.256
What are you, your mom?

49:30.051 --> 49:32.720
You know that big boy,
Roland?

49:32.929 --> 49:36.182
He must have lost, like,
40 pounds over the summer.

49:36.391 --> 49:38.101
I think he got
that stomach surgery.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.477
Oh, yeah.

49:39.686 --> 49:41.020
Yeah, shit.

49:41.229 --> 49:44.232
It's that stomach shit.
Ah, fuck...

49:44.441 --> 49:45.525
Gastric bypass.

49:45.733 --> 49:47.152
Oh! Look at you.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.029
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you, Professor Joey.

49:50.238 --> 49:52.031
Man, that shit
really makes you smarter.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.616
Yeah, it does.

50:00.915 --> 50:02.125
What?

50:03.710 --> 50:05.378
She won't leave me alone, man.

50:09.090 --> 50:12.385
Yeah, you know,
she's got a lot on her mind.

50:15.263 --> 50:18.141
It's just like, when she's home,
like all alone,

50:18.349 --> 50:19.726
she gets so crazy.

50:19.934 --> 50:21.686
It's weird.

50:21.895 --> 50:25.398
She just wants to clean
and clean and clean and clean.

50:25.607 --> 50:27.650
You know,
I don't get it.

50:27.859 --> 50:29.194
I really don't.

50:31.321 --> 50:34.324
No, I get it.

50:36.326 --> 50:40.747
You know, when my mom
was still around,

50:40.955 --> 50:44.584
my dad used to go out
drinking without her.

50:46.878 --> 50:48.671
It used to fuck her up.

50:48.880 --> 50:53.343
She'd get so crazy
and so nervous.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.846
It was like a crime
was being committed

50:57.055 --> 50:59.098
if we weren't scrubbing
the baseboards.

51:00.725 --> 51:02.268
Call the police.

51:06.814 --> 51:08.316
Can I hit that?

51:08.525 --> 51:09.776
Can I please
have some of that?

51:09.984 --> 51:11.444
- Thank you.
- Right there, brother.

51:18.660 --> 51:19.869
You okay, there?

51:20.078 --> 51:23.164
Wow, this is the Cali bud.

51:26.668 --> 51:28.795
Yeah, you definitely
know your stuff, there.

51:41.349 --> 51:42.809
Hey, Joey?

51:44.227 --> 51:45.979
How long did it take,

51:46.187 --> 51:49.732
you know, after she died,
until you got used to it?

51:57.115 --> 51:59.659
Brendan, your dad
is coming back, okay?

52:00.994 --> 52:02.120
So shut up.

52:15.258 --> 52:17.760
That fucking thing.
Give me that.

52:17.969 --> 52:19.846
What? I th--

52:20.054 --> 52:23.266
Britt tells me you've been
hanging out with this guy's kid?

52:24.934 --> 52:27.186
What are you up to, Joe?

52:27.395 --> 52:28.438
Huh?

52:30.106 --> 52:32.150
You trying to get us caught?

52:33.860 --> 52:37.071
I was keeping an eye
on the situation.

52:37.280 --> 52:39.824
Making sure he didn't
find out anything.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.243
You stay away
from this kid.

52:42.452 --> 52:44.454
Do you understand?

52:44.662 --> 52:47.624
Do you understand?

52:47.832 --> 52:49.459
Yes, sir.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.883
What did I tell you
about shooting my goddamn tree?

52:58.259 --> 52:59.719
P
Aah! $1

52:59.927 --> 53:01.012
Fuck!

53:21.074 --> 53:22.909
Brats, move.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.369
Move, move.

53:24.577 --> 53:25.787
Chrissy.

53:27.789 --> 53:28.873
Thank you.

53:31.459 --> 53:33.795
Just watch your stupid
TV show.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.180
Get up, Joe.

53:45.348 --> 53:46.683
Dad's cooking dinner.

53:48.309 --> 53:50.937
Wake up, Joe.
Dad's cooking dinner.

53:54.399 --> 53:56.150
Come on, wake up.
Wake up.

53:56.359 --> 53:58.361
Oh, whoa, whoa.

54:01.364 --> 54:03.032
I like your technique.
I like what's going on.

54:03.241 --> 54:05.368
Let's speed it up
a little bit, all right?

54:07.954 --> 54:09.706
Don't be shy with the plane.
Get the plane.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.710
Put it right in here.
That's it.

54:13.918 --> 54:15.920
That's what I'm talking about.
The whole truck.

54:16.129 --> 54:17.714
The whole truck.
Bring the whole truck.

54:17.922 --> 54:19.674
Like this.
That's nice on the...

54:21.467 --> 54:22.635
How are those coming along,
Joey?

54:22.844 --> 54:23.928
They're good.

54:24.137 --> 54:25.972
Let's get them steaks
in here.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.390
Dinnertime.

54:32.562 --> 54:34.605
We never eat this.

54:36.399 --> 54:38.526
It's good, isn't it?

54:42.321 --> 54:43.740
I don't like it.

54:43.948 --> 54:46.617
You haven't tried it yet, honey.

54:46.826 --> 54:48.703
I'll make you a piece smaller.

54:48.911 --> 54:50.371
She said she didn't
like it.

54:50.580 --> 54:52.165
Yeah, I heard her. Hm.

54:54.375 --> 54:56.669
Maybe this piece needs a place
to come and park. Remember this?

54:56.878 --> 54:58.838
Chrissy, you don't have to eat
it if you don't want to.

55:00.923 --> 55:02.258
There it is!

55:03.676 --> 55:05.219
What do you
think of it now?

55:05.428 --> 55:07.597
- Pretty good, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.974
It's better when it comes in
for a landing.

55:10.183 --> 55:12.101
What do you think of yours,
Blake?

55:12.310 --> 55:14.353
Paughs]

55:14.562 --> 55:16.022
It's bloody good.

55:16.230 --> 55:17.774
Bloody good.

55:17.982 --> 55:19.609
Well, maybe you need
some more blood on it.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.111
Put some more blood on that.
Yeah.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.071
That's what
I'm talking about.

55:25.364 --> 55:26.824
Can we afford this?

55:28.493 --> 55:29.827
What's life if you don't treat
yourself

55:30.036 --> 55:31.078
once in a while?

55:31.287 --> 55:32.622
Right?

55:32.830 --> 55:35.166
You're liking that more,
I'm noticing that.

55:35.374 --> 55:37.293
Paughs]

55:37.502 --> 55:39.420
Right?

55:46.511 --> 55:47.595
Mm.

56:00.149 --> 56:01.359
All right.

56:01.567 --> 56:02.777
That's enough.

56:04.320 --> 56:05.446
Okay, that's enough.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.493
Hey! That's enough!

56:18.209 --> 56:19.961
I try to do
something nice...

56:22.088 --> 56:23.714
and you act like
a bunch of brats.

56:34.308 --> 56:39.021
You know, this was a-- A really
great meal that you cooked.

56:39.230 --> 56:41.774
Oh, I did, huh?

56:43.442 --> 56:45.111
I'd like to applaud
the lady of the house

56:45.319 --> 56:46.571
for cooking
such a great meal.

56:46.779 --> 56:47.864
Hm?

56:49.615 --> 56:51.742
Putting on an apron,
going out there in the cold.

56:55.705 --> 56:57.206
Come on.

56:57.415 --> 56:58.708
Thank you.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.293
- You're very welcome.
- Thank you.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.087
Thank you.

57:05.172 --> 57:06.632
Family time.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.677
We should do this
more often.

57:11.888 --> 57:13.514
What are you getting into
this weekend?

57:13.723 --> 57:14.765
I don't know.

57:14.974 --> 57:16.058
I haven't decided yet.

57:16.267 --> 57:17.768
.L might go to a party.
- Really?

57:17.977 --> 57:20.771
Everyone is so wasted
and annoying all the time.

57:20.980 --> 57:23.733
Well, I'm having a little
thing at my place Friday night,

57:23.941 --> 57:26.027
if you want
to come through.

57:35.369 --> 57:37.121
I'm so sorry.

57:37.330 --> 57:39.707
That's okay. That's okay.
That's okay.

58:26.170 --> 58:29.090
<i>It's Rich. Leave</i> a <i>message.</i>

58:34.053 --> 58:36.639
This is the business
of Greg Carlson, 46,

58:36.847 --> 58:38.724
of Southfield,
Connecticut,

58:38.933 --> 58:41.686
which he owned and operated
for nearly 20 years.

58:41.894 --> 58:45.523
Although official cause of death
has not been fully declared,

58:45.731 --> 58:47.942
- foul play <i>is</i> suspected.
- Come on, guys.

58:48.150 --> 58:51.112
You know, I can't leave you
alone for ten minutes.

58:51.320 --> 58:54.782
What did I tell you
about watching this shit?

58:57.368 --> 58:59.161
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

59:01.664 --> 59:04.291
<i>Murders don't
happen around here much.</i>

59:04.500 --> 59:07.044
Not at all, really.

59:07.253 --> 59:09.588
They're gonna start
looking everywhere,

59:09.797 --> 59:11.966
they'll start putting pieces
together.

59:12.174 --> 59:15.219
We covered all of our bases.

59:15.428 --> 59:17.346
There's no way that they can
trace this back to us.

59:17.555 --> 59:19.557
Shut the fuck up, Keegan.

59:19.765 --> 59:21.225
You stupid motherfucker,
I swear to God,

59:21.434 --> 59:23.102
you say another fucking
stupid thing like that,

59:23.310 --> 59:24.937
I'll kick the shit out of you.

59:25.146 --> 59:26.939
I'm fucking so tired of you,
you fat motherfucker.

59:27.148 --> 59:28.524
We were doing fine
without you here.

59:28.733 --> 59:30.443
- Step outside.
- This is because

59:30.651 --> 59:31.902
you couldn't hold your shit
together.

59:32.111 --> 59:33.237
Now we're in this fucking shit!

59:33.446 --> 59:36.323
See what's happening here?
Huh?

59:38.367 --> 59:40.036
People are getting tense.

59:40.244 --> 59:43.706
And when they get tense,
they get chatty.

59:43.914 --> 59:46.709
And when people
get tense and chatty...

59:48.878 --> 59:50.963
they act like morons.

59:51.172 --> 59:53.090
You know what happens
to morons?

59:53.299 --> 59:54.341
Hm?

59:55.593 --> 59:57.219
They get caught.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.154
Two babies being born
tonight.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.364
He's too tall.

01:00:17.573 --> 01:00:18.908
Put her over here,

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.701
and him over here.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.915
All right, there we go.
Festive.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.688
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:48.831
Did Britt ask you
to keep an eye on me?

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:51.750
No.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:55.045
Inn:

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:58.549
You were going
to the funeral.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.217
Yeah.

01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:04.096
When you're dead,
everyone's your best friend.

01:02:04.305 --> 01:02:06.473
Who was he to you?

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.897
That's why I couldn't go in.

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:17.026
I never know what to say.

01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.906
Just follow
what everybody else does.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.490
I could.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:30.206
You know, the last time
I was here, my grandmother died.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:33.167
And I couldn't go in,
even for her.

01:02:38.214 --> 01:02:40.382
Hear what they're saying?

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:47.848
That his face was bashed in
so badly,

01:02:48.057 --> 01:02:50.309
they couldn't have
an open casket.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.190
It wasn't an accident.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:02.363
Yeah, well, people will say
anything for a better story.

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:06.408
Yeah.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.208
Hey, Tara--

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:17.753
You know, not a single
one of you has me fooled.

01:03:17.962 --> 01:03:20.422
I know who you are.

01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:26.929
Half the fucking
town's at this guy's funeral.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.180
Small town.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.726
We got company.

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:54.290
Officer.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:57.835
We really do need
to stop meeting like this.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:01.005
Not here asking
about power tools, Ritchie.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:05.509
Trying to figure out
what you are here for, babe.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:10.306
Where were the two of you the
night Greg Carlson was killed?

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.725
Aw, honey, I don't even know
what day that was.

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:14.518
Fourteenth.

01:04:16.312 --> 01:04:18.439
I was at Dowdy's
having a beer.

01:04:18.647 --> 01:04:20.733
Yeah, I already checked
with the bar.

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:22.609
They didn't see you.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.696
We had a bonfire.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.992
I was having problems
with my girl.

01:04:31.744 --> 01:04:33.537
They wanted to get me drunk.

01:04:33.746 --> 01:04:35.372
How old are you?

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:37.916
What, are you trying
to arrest them

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.209
for giving alcohol
to a minor?

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:41.420
- Joe--
- No.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.672
My best friend's dad
is dead.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.633
I'm still in my funeral clothes

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.427
and you're here
stirring up shit.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.389
Brendan's dad...

01:04:52.598 --> 01:04:55.100
he's never coming back.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.312
They will never
share a beer together.

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.985
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:05:05.194 --> 01:05:07.446
Thanks.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.698
Now get off our property.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.081
You heard him.

01:05:37.476 --> 01:05:40.771
Hey, you really go
to that guy's funeral?

01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:36.869
Brendan?

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.120
Honey, are you in here?

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.538
Yeah.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.165
Your cousins are downstairs

01:06:41.373 --> 01:06:42.916
and they want to say goodbye.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.710
Down in a minute.

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.412
Brendan.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:24.082
Brendan.

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.584
- What's going on?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.461
- You have cows in there?
- Shh.

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:28.712
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:30.339
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.674
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Brendan, look,

01:07:32.883 --> 01:07:35.552
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to make it to the funeral,

01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:37.804
but you gotta get the fuck
out of here, man.

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:39.348
- No, no, no, no...
- Seriously.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.557
No.

01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:43.060
You gotta come somewhere
with me.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:44.311
I can't.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.063
L-- Literally, I can't.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:47.689
No, you have to.

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:50.526
I'm sorry, you gotta go,
Brendan.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:53.028
You have to. I know something
that the cops don't.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:58.158
Yeah. Come on, man.
You have to come with me.

01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:00.035
Let's go.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:13.924
Hey, Brendan,
where are we going?

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.801
You know, one night
my Dad came home,

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.345
said he had to tell me
something.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.849
He must of had about ten
fucking martinis.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.229
He said, "Brendan...

01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:32.984
"do whatever makes you happy

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.444
and fuck the rest."

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:55.465
Brendan.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.303
Brendan.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.265
Whose house is this?

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:06.184
Brendan, it's 1:00
in the morning.

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:11.732
Brendan, where the fuck
are we?

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:16.361
Come on.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.071
Jesus, who is that?

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.906
What happened to him?

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:25.828
You've got the wrong house.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.497
Bullshit, you know who I am.

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:30.375
Hey, man, come on.

01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.336
- Let's get out of here.
- You got the wrong house.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:34.004
Cut the shit, okay?

01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:35.380
You were fucking him,
weren't you?

01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:37.006
What are you doing, man?

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.884
Come on, let's go.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.970
You know you weren't
his only whore, right?

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:44.680
Yeah, that's why you fucking
killed him.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:48.518
I didn't...
I didn't kill him.

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:51.063
Bullshit! You're a
fucking liar and a whore!

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.356
Brendan!

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:54.066
lam not a fucking liar
or a whore!

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:55.984
If you don't get out,
I'm gonna call the cops.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:58.737
Oh, yeah? Call them.
Call the fucking cops.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.364
- I will.
- Call the cops.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.324
And tell them
you fucking killed my dad!

01:10:02.532 --> 01:10:05.952
I will. I will call
the fucking cops!

01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:07.496
- Brendan!
- Bitch!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:08.747
Come on!

01:10:13.168 --> 01:10:14.336
Hey, Brendan, did you--?

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.129
Did you tell anybody
about her yet?

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:21.677
You scared her, man.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.763
I don't care.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.057
What the fuck do you know
anyway?

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.725
Yeah, shit.
That's what you know.

01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:30.060
All right, come on,
pull over.

01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:31.645
Brendan.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.397
No, man, fuck the rest.

01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:34.898
- Fuck the rest.
- Pull over!

01:10:35.107 --> 01:10:37.317
- Fuck the rest!
- Pull over the car!

01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:39.486
What the fuck--?

01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:43.949
What the fuck
is your problem?

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.576
Get out, I'm driving.

01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:53.500
Get out!

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.295
You know what?

01:10:57.504 --> 01:10:59.589
Fuck you, Joey!

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:03.301
You want to know why
we don't hang out anymore?

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:06.054
Because my dad
didn't want me hanging out

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:08.765
with your white-trash,
loser family!

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:10.600
Dude, get the fuck off me, man.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.105
Fucking asshole.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:17.649
Fucking asshole.

01:11:17.858 --> 01:11:18.942
Brendan.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:22.362
Brendan. Brendan.

01:11:22.571 --> 01:11:23.989
Brendan!

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.324
Brendan!

01:11:27.534 --> 01:11:28.618
Shit.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.159
Jeez...

01:12:21.922 --> 01:12:23.340
Why are you so sweaty?

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.844
Uh, I went for a run, buddy.

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:30.889
You don't run.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.434
It was a fast walk.

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:35.685
Paughs]

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:42.859
God...

01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:53.954
Thank you.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.459
Shit.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.599
Hey. what's up?

01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:56.892
Hey.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.061
What are you doing
on this side of town?

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.772
I was driving by.

01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:04.900
You saw my car over here,
didn't you?

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.277
You were wondering,
"I wonder what he's doing here."

01:14:08.904 --> 01:14:09.988
Right?

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:12.657
Figures.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:17.203
They brought me in
to ask me a few questions.

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:18.455
This and that.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:20.540
The guys are clueless.

01:14:20.749 --> 01:14:22.417
Dogs without noses.
I was--

01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:25.420
I was in and out of the place
in, like, ten minutes.

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:28.298
I didn't tell your dad
and your cousin about this.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:30.467
Wouldn't want to get them
worried about nothing, right?

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:31.718
Paughs]

01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:35.263
Boo!

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:36.890
Paughs]

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:38.558
Got you, you PUSSY-

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.780
What are you doing here?

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:35.615
Your cousin send you?

01:15:35.824 --> 01:15:37.158
Fucking idiot,
didn't show up for work.

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:38.994
No phone call,
no nothing.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:40.412
What do you want?

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.663
Uh...

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.540
Spit it out. What?

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.586
I-I-I saw Keegan
at the police station.

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:50.672
- What?
- I saw Keegan

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.340
at the police station.

01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:55.051
What were you doing
at the police station?

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.095
- I was--
- Hey!

01:15:57.303 --> 01:16:00.807
Hey! I don't know what he's
telling you, but it ain't true.

01:16:01.016 --> 01:16:04.811
- Fuck did you do?
- I went to the police station.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.563
- What?
- Just listen.

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.523
I figured they were
gonna bring me in eventually,

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:11.401
so why not just
beat them to it?

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:15.030
You don't voluntarily walk
into a fucking police station.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.281
What'd you tell them?

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.699
Paughs]

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.534
Sent those fuckers
on a wild goose chase.

01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:21.036
How's that?

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.746
I gave them some names
of some guys

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:24.039
he owed money to.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.082
Guy was a lowlife.

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:29.544
Huh. So what happens when they
find out you were playing them?

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:33.173
They won't. I gave them some
secondhand bullshit.

01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:35.550
Who'd be dumb enough
to go down to the police station

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:37.010
if they were guilty?

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:39.804
I promise you, we're good.

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:42.557
You did this
without talking to me.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.602
What were you doing
at the police station?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.604
- We're good!
- We ain't good.

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.899
I went to go pick up Allyson
at her place

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.484
and drove past
the police station

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:53.902
and saw Keegan's
car there.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.653
Nice of you to show up
three hours late,

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:56.946
and no phone call,
no nothing.

01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:59.032
We got a shit storm
going on over here.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.451
Hey! Hey!

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:02.994
Hey! Come on, come on.

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:04.287
No. no, no, no, no.

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:05.955
Hell, Come on!

01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:07.791
- You psycho.
- He's an asshole!

01:17:07.999 --> 01:17:10.627
- He tell you what he did?
- You fucking psycho!

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:12.212
Did you tell him
what you did?

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.546
What, you gonna murder me, too?

01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:14.881
He showed up
at Tara's house

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:16.132
with the dead guy's kid!

01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:18.551
- What?
- Started interrogating her.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.512
I didn'tâ I didn't know--

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.347
I didn't know
we were going there.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.599
And he didn't know nothing,
okay?

01:17:26.101 --> 01:17:27.268
He didn't find out
anything.

01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:28.561
Tara's freaking out.

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:29.896
Threatening to go
to the cops.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:31.147
I don't know what to do.

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:32.649
Shut up!

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:33.942
Both of you, shut up.

01:17:39.614 --> 01:17:41.825
You weren't strong enough
for this.

01:17:42.033 --> 01:17:44.410
It's my fault, see,

01:17:44.619 --> 01:17:47.122
because I was too stupid
to realize it.

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.208
You put all of us,

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.919
all of us, the kids,
at risk.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.131
Me?

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.424
No, no, not me.

01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:01.136
You can't even take care
of your own family.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:02.470
Mom knew.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.222
Yeah, Mom knew.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.641
She told me we could never rely
on a piece of shit like you.

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:14.941
Okay.

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:16.359
- Rich.
- Yeah?

01:18:16.568 --> 01:18:17.610
Rich.

01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:19.112
Rich.

01:18:47.432 --> 01:18:49.100
He ain't gonna be able
to keep his mouth shut.

01:18:49.309 --> 01:18:53.646
You ever hit my kid again,
I'll snap your fucking neck.

01:19:22.926 --> 01:19:24.135
She serious?

01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:28.223
Tara can be so dramatic.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.099
It's hard to tell.

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:34.479
Maybe you should
go talk with her.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.105
She doesn't
listen to me.

01:19:37.899 --> 01:19:39.484
Even if she doesn't
go to the cops,

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:40.985
they're gonna bring her in
eventually.

01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:44.489
No way she can make it
through an interrogation.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.574
You're one to
talk, you fucking snitch.

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:49.410
If I talked, the cops would
be kicking in your fucking door.

01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:52.997
Britt, if Keegan said anything,
we'll deal with it.

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.669
But for now
he got a point.

01:19:57.877 --> 01:19:59.963
If she's teetering,

01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:02.632
it's only gonna get worse.

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:07.595
That's why you should go
talk with her.

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.973
Did that already.

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.524
If you got another way,

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.317
I'd like to hear it.

01:20:26.614 --> 01:20:28.199
What are we talking about?

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:32.287
Hey.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:34.080
What are we
talking about here?

01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:38.918
What the fuck you
think we're talking about?

01:21:42.774 --> 01:21:43.858
Hey.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.028
Let me know if you need
anything else.

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:49.906
Hey, Allyson.

01:21:52.075 --> 01:21:53.201
Hey!

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:54.786
Hey, I really need
to talk to you.

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.746
Yeah, now you want
to fucking talk to me?

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:57.997
Yeah.

01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:00.833
All right.

01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:02.585
Allyson.

01:22:02.794 --> 01:22:03.920
Allyson.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:06.297
- Allyson!
"ca" ' help you?

01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:11.511
What?

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.642
Something really bad
happened.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.520
Yeah.

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:22.730
And I'm scared.

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:27.068
And I don't know
what to do.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.070
Story of your life.

01:22:31.406 --> 01:22:33.408
Whatever it is...

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.286
whatever you did...

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.790
some things can't be fixed.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:23.124
What the shit, Joey?
Shut the door.

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:28.129
Watch your mouth,
you zombie.

01:24:12.632 --> 01:24:14.717
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:24:16.886 --> 01:24:20.306
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:24:20.515 --> 01:24:22.350
Hello? <i>Is</i> someone there?

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:27.104
Yeah, I'm here.

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:30.942
Joey?

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:32.944
What are--?
What are you doing here?

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:34.695
- Are you--?
-ls Brendan home?

01:24:34.904 --> 01:24:38.115
Yeah, but are you okay?
What's going on?

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:40.159
Hey, Mom.

01:24:40.368 --> 01:24:41.869
It's okay,
he can come up.

01:24:45.373 --> 01:24:46.457
Hey-

01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:58.928
Brendan...

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.223
Look, man...

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.268
I'm really sorry,
okay?

01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:12.525
Leaving you back there
was a dick move.

01:25:17.989 --> 01:25:20.866
I didn't mean anything I said
about you or your family either.

01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:27.206
We were best friends, man.

01:25:28.666 --> 01:25:30.209
I was there.

01:25:30.418 --> 01:25:32.461
What?

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:39.010
When your dad was killed.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.096
I was there.

01:25:48.686 --> 01:25:51.731
I was supposed
to be lookout,

01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:54.609
but I missed a car
in the back.

01:25:57.528 --> 01:26:01.240
It was for fucking coins.
No harm.

01:26:01.449 --> 01:26:03.701
The insurance,
you know.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:09.540
But then your dad
got out of the car,

01:26:09.749 --> 01:26:11.292
and he was drunk.

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:16.714
He came after me,
and then Britt came out.

01:26:33.356 --> 01:26:34.982
Was he scared?

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:39.654
Was my dad scared?

01:26:42.782 --> 01:26:43.949
Yeah.

01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:47.036
Yeah, he was scared.

01:27:39.088 --> 01:27:41.966

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:04.572
Tara.

01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:08.492
Tara, you home?

01:28:13.372 --> 01:28:14.665
Tara.

01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:30.806
Tara?

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:36.437
Tara?

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.152
Tara?

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.284
You sleeping?

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:56.749
Rich!

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:58.000
Britt!

01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:01.462
Damn it.

01:29:07.218 --> 01:29:09.470
Stay down! Stay down!

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:14.558
Oh, no.

01:29:14.767 --> 01:29:18.187
Please, please, please,
Britt, come on.

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:20.815
Come on, you fucking
know me, Britt.

01:29:21.023 --> 01:29:22.066
Please.

01:29:23.484 --> 01:29:24.819
Please.

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:30.115
You fucking pussy, do it!

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:33.994
Do it. Do it, and let's get
out of here.

01:29:35.996 --> 01:29:37.081
Do it!

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:42.795
Rich?

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:21.584
If you guys need anything at
all, please let me know, okay?

01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:23.127
Thank you.

01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:38.183
<i>Do you know how brave
you are to do what you did?</i>

01:30:38.392 --> 01:30:44.189
Hey, uh, do you know where
Blake and Chrissy are right now?

01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:47.067
They're in a safe
place with our social worker.

01:30:47.276 --> 01:30:48.319
Don't worry.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.411
You're under arrest.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.914
<i>Do you have any other family?</i>

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:05.711
Yeah, I-- I think I have
a great-aunt on my mom's side.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.546
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:31:07.755 --> 01:31:09.214
Anything you say...

01:31:09.423 --> 01:31:11.175
There's a chance
they could go to her,

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:13.302
<i>but I can't make
any promises.</i>

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:15.888
If you cannot afford
one, one will be provided for you.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:19.183
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:31.570
Hey, Mel.

01:31:31.779 --> 01:31:33.155
<i>They're coming in.</i>

01:31:38.077 --> 01:31:39.912
I'll be back.

01:31:57.137 --> 01:31:59.014
It's gonna be okay.

01:32:07.231 --> 01:32:08.774
I love you.

01:32:08.983 --> 01:32:11.026
I love you, too, baby.
