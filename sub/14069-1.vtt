00:00.003 --> 00:01.310
<i>Previously, on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.311 --> 00:03.145
Listening to his
closing argument,

00:03.169 --> 00:04.669
I almost want
to let him go myself,

00:04.704 --> 00:06.203
except for one thing--
he's a liar.

00:06.239 --> 00:08.339
He thinks he doesn't have
to play by the same rules.

00:08.374 --> 00:10.841
But we know he does.

00:10.877 --> 00:12.410
- What did you do?
- I pled guilty.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.145
If you think I'm gonna
let you do this,

00:14.180 --> 00:15.813
you're out
of your goddamn mind.

00:15.848 --> 00:18.015
He cut a deal
to save this firm.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.318
He cut a deal to keep us
from going to prison.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.253
We give Evan people
who already want to go,

00:22.288 --> 00:24.488
and I give Anita Gibbs murderers
in exchange for Mike.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.891
And what if it doesn't work
and we lose everything?

00:26.926 --> 00:30.361
Then we do. But if we don't
try to save him, who are we?

00:30.396 --> 00:32.496
Make the deal.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.065
I am not letting you
go to prison

00:34.100 --> 00:35.566
for a crime
that I committed.

00:35.602 --> 00:38.035
I'm not letting you go when
you're gonna be found innocent!

00:38.071 --> 00:39.337
Why the hell would
you lie to me?

00:39.372 --> 00:41.005
'Cause the truth
would've broken you.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.206
You know what, Harvey?

00:42.241 --> 00:43.507
You want to come to my wedding,
you let me know.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.911
I'm not trying to take
your place anymore.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.546
I'm trying to get you ready
because you're weak.

00:48.581 --> 00:52.350
- Harvey, I am not weak.
- Yeah? Well, hit me.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.451
Is this what you want?

00:53.486 --> 00:55.486
That I hate you
and that you made me do this?

00:55.521 --> 00:58.556
We lose everything
because of you!

01:01.928 --> 01:03.894
I am not saying that
I don't want to get married.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.262
You go finish law school.

01:05.298 --> 01:06.897
And then in two years,
when I get out,

01:06.933 --> 01:09.867
if you still want
to marry me...

01:11.738 --> 01:13.738
They're all gone.

01:16.175 --> 01:18.109
Watch your back
in there, Mike.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.944
I will.

01:29.555 --> 01:32.189
General wake-up
for all inmates is at 6:00 a.m.

01:32.225 --> 01:33.991
You will be standing next
to your bed at that time.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.927
If you are not, you will face
disciplinary action.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.329
At least five inmate counts

01:38.364 --> 01:40.264
will be held
during each 24-hour period

01:40.299 --> 01:42.033
at random times.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.235
You will stand still during
every one of those counts.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.338
If you are not, you will face
disciplinary action.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.407
You will be at meals on time
if you want to eat.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.842
You will be at work on time,
no matter what.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.879
You will keep your cell in
a clean and sanitary condition.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.982
If you fail in any of these
areas, you will face...

01:58.017 --> 01:59.283
Disciplinary action.

01:59.318 --> 02:02.219
Good.
You're getting the picture.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.822
Do you mind if I ask
what disciplinary action means?

02:04.857 --> 02:06.357
Since you got the balls
to ask that,

02:06.392 --> 02:09.794
I'm sure you're gonna
find out soon enough.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.295
- What's this for?
- What do you think it's for?

02:11.330 --> 02:13.531
Strip naked, put everything
you own inside that bag,

02:13.566 --> 02:15.433
then follow me.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.550
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

02:32.585 --> 02:35.486
I came to let you know
that I dropped him off,

02:35.521 --> 02:40.458
and, um, he looks as good
as he could look.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.359
And I think
he's gonna be okay.

02:42.395 --> 02:43.961
I appreciate that.

02:43.996 --> 02:45.796
But you could have told me
that over the phone.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.132
So what are you
really doing here?

02:48.167 --> 02:50.501
I miss him.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.138
I miss him too.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.279
- Where the hell are you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

03:02.315 --> 03:05.015
I'm going home, Louis.
Look, don't you get it?

03:05.051 --> 03:07.084
They're all gone--
every single one of them.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.486
Yeah, well,
we knew that already.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.087
No, no,
I don't think you understand.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.889
I'm not just talking
about the partners.

03:11.924 --> 03:13.791
I'm talking about everyone,
from the accountants

03:13.826 --> 03:16.494
to the secretaries to the guy
who shines my shoes, Donna.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.895
All of them, gone.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.497
And what exactly do you
want me to do about it?

03:19.532 --> 03:21.932
I want you to get Harvey
on the goddamn phone.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.534
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

03:23.569 --> 03:25.803
Because tonight's not
the night to call Harvey.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.104
Why, because of Mike?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.906
I don't know if you've noticed,
but Mike is gone,

03:28.941 --> 03:30.441
along with everybody else.

03:30.476 --> 03:31.809
And if we don't figure
something out by tonight,

03:31.844 --> 03:33.911
we are gonna be left
with nothing.

03:33.946 --> 03:35.980
I didn't say we weren't gonna
figure something out, Louis.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.414
I said we're not
calling Harvey.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.716
Well, then what the hell
are we gonna do?

03:38.751 --> 03:40.317
Right now
I'm gonna go to my office

03:40.353 --> 03:42.753
and fix myself
a goddamn drink.

03:44.690 --> 03:47.792
The first time I met him?

03:47.827 --> 03:49.393
What do you think
I thought?

03:49.428 --> 03:50.895
I...

03:50.930 --> 03:52.229
I thought he was an idiot.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.464
Imagine how I felt

03:53.499 --> 03:55.399
when a bunch of weed spilled
out of his briefcase

03:55.434 --> 03:57.234
ten seconds after he walked
into his interview.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.236
I know. You were so horrified,
you got on the phone,

03:59.272 --> 04:00.337
and you called the police.

04:00.373 --> 04:02.473
No, wait.
You didn't do that.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.041
You offered
the idiot a job.

04:04.076 --> 04:05.843
That's because
after I heard his story,

04:05.878 --> 04:07.945
I knew he wasn't
an idiot after all.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.880
And I knew by the end
of that first morning

04:09.916 --> 04:11.849
that he wasn't like anyone
I'd ever met,

04:11.884 --> 04:15.920
and that if I wasn't careful,
I was gonna be in trouble.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.390
- To trouble.
- To trouble.

04:25.264 --> 04:29.300
Look at that.
Louis left me a voice mail.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.268
I don't understand.
You seem happy about that.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.037
That's because one
of my favorite pastimes

04:33.072 --> 04:34.705
is to listen
to one of Louis's messages.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.540
What if he's upset
about something?

04:36.576 --> 04:38.042
He's always upset
about something.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.710
That's why one
of my favorite pastimes

04:39.745 --> 04:42.179
is to listen to one
of Louis's messages.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.114
<i>Damn it, Harvey,</i>
<i>pick up the goddamn phone,</i>

04:44.150 --> 04:46.083
<i>because this entire firm</i>
<i>is a ghost town,</i>

04:46.118 --> 04:47.518
<i>and I'm sorry</i>
<i>Mike's in prison,</i>

04:47.553 --> 04:49.153
<i>but if we don't figure</i>
<i>something out,</i>

04:49.188 --> 04:50.754
<i>what you and your</i>
<i>little sidekick did</i>

04:50.790 --> 04:52.456
<i>is gonna be the end of us.</i>

04:52.491 --> 04:54.391
<i>And don't give me some bullshit</i>
<i>about tonight isn't the time,</i>

04:54.427 --> 04:56.227
<i>because--</i>

04:56.262 --> 04:57.394
I got to go.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.896
Yeah, I know.
I'm coming with you.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.297
Rachel, you heard
what Louis said.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.233
This is gonna be a rough night.
You need to stay here.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.935
Harvey, it's gonna be a rough
night no matter where I am.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.337
And at least
if I'm with you,

05:06.372 --> 05:07.838
there's a chance
that I could be of some use.

05:07.874 --> 05:11.375
You better get your coat,
because we don't have much time.

05:19.151 --> 05:20.384
Now what?

05:20.419 --> 05:23.721
Now you get dressed,
and you wait.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.192
Would you like
some more drinks?

05:28.227 --> 05:30.895
Can I offer you an appetizer,
maybe some truffle fries,

05:30.930 --> 05:32.429
or are we allowed
to talk business now?

05:32.465 --> 05:34.965
All right, Louis,
what do you think we should do,

05:35.001 --> 05:36.400
since it was
your recommendation

05:36.435 --> 05:38.869
that landed us in this mess
in the first place?

05:38.905 --> 05:40.704
I recommended that because
it was a last-ditch effort

05:40.740 --> 05:41.972
to get Mike out of prison.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.874
And you also said
we'd only lose 50%

05:43.910 --> 05:45.809
of our partners
to Evan Smith.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.378
How could I have known
that she had the capacity

05:47.413 --> 05:49.446
to bring on more than that?
Don't you get it?

05:49.482 --> 05:50.915
The rest didn't go
to Evan Smith.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.250
They just walked the hell out
and went somewhere else.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.885
Then we can sue
their asses.

05:54.921 --> 05:57.154
With what lawyers,
what resources, and what money?

05:57.189 --> 05:58.989
Because I don't know
if you noticed,

05:59.025 --> 06:00.758
but this firm has been gutted
because of your recommendation.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.860
No, Jessica, it was gutted
because of mine.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.561
Damn it, Louis.
I told you not to call him.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.330
Well, I did.
Because he's a partner,

06:06.365 --> 06:07.998
and like he just said,
he was the one

06:08.034 --> 06:10.000
who wanted to sever the
noncompetes in the first place.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.502
You're right, Louis.
I did.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.670
But I didn't come down here

06:12.705 --> 06:14.338
to play Pin the Blame
on the Harvey.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.674
I came down here to figure out
what the hell we're gonna do.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.509
Then let's get to it.

06:19.845 --> 06:21.445
May I help you?
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt,

06:21.480 --> 06:23.213
but there was no one
at reception,

06:23.249 --> 06:25.082
and I have your order here.
You got to be kidding me.

06:25.117 --> 06:26.550
You call me down here
for an emergency,

06:26.585 --> 06:28.485
and then you take the time
to order Chinese food?

06:28.521 --> 06:30.087
I didn't order anything,
asshole.

06:30.122 --> 06:31.855
So you crouch your tiger,
hide your dragon,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.024
or I'm gonna Wang Chung
your ass out of here.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.393
Louis, calm down.
Clearly, there's some mistake.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.962
No one at this firm
has ordered any food.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.496
Well, I'm pretty sure
this is the right place,

06:39.532 --> 06:41.198
because the name on your door
says Jessica Pearson,

06:41.233 --> 06:42.866
and this order is
for a Jessica Pearson.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.835
- Yeah this is Jessica Pearson.
- Louis!

06:44.870 --> 06:46.170
What?

06:46.205 --> 06:47.871
They know
I'm not really here

06:47.907 --> 06:49.873
to bring you
an egg roll, asshole.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.910
I'm here to serve you
with this.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.913
- What is that?
- It's a class action.

06:55.948 --> 07:00.517
We're being sued for every
case Mike Ross has ever touched.

07:34.806 --> 07:36.474
That's why they all left.

07:36.509 --> 07:38.209
They knew this was coming,
and they got out

07:38.244 --> 07:39.544
so they could all
have it on record

07:39.579 --> 07:41.946
that they were gone
before the suit came down.

07:41.981 --> 07:43.881
Then we need to know
who the hell tipped them off.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.850
It doesn't matter
who tipped them off.

07:45.885 --> 07:47.919
What matters is,
if we lose this suit,

07:47.954 --> 07:50.021
we can't handle the money.

07:50.056 --> 07:51.756
How much are
they suing us for?

07:51.791 --> 07:53.925
- $100 million.
- God damn it.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.593
We need to get
those partners back.

07:55.628 --> 07:57.428
I told you, we're never gonna
get them back.

07:57.463 --> 07:59.330
And right now we don't even
know where they went.

07:59.365 --> 08:00.965
I do.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.967
How the hell did you
pull that off?

08:03.002 --> 08:04.802
Because lawyers don't talk
to lawyers,

08:04.837 --> 08:07.471
but secretaries
talk to secretaries.

08:07.507 --> 08:09.307
That is a list
of who went where.

08:09.342 --> 08:11.042
Okay, we need a paper trail
tonight--

08:11.077 --> 08:12.877
notices of breach
of contract--

08:12.912 --> 08:14.312
and we need to get on record

08:14.347 --> 08:15.780
that those partners
aren't off the hook.

08:15.815 --> 08:17.315
It's too late
to send out notices.

08:17.350 --> 08:20.818
We already got served
with the lawsuit.

08:20.853 --> 08:22.320
He didn't record the time.

08:22.355 --> 08:24.822
Donna, there's $5,000
in the cigar box on my desk.

08:24.857 --> 08:25.923
Get it now.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.892
Wait. Where the hell
are you going?

08:27.927 --> 08:29.060
I'm going downstairs

08:29.095 --> 08:30.995
to tell that server
he can have every nickel of it

08:31.030 --> 08:33.264
to say he didn't deliver that
thing for another two hours.

08:33.299 --> 08:34.999
Assuming Harvey
doesn't shit the bed,

08:35.034 --> 08:36.500
we've got two hours
to figure out

08:36.535 --> 08:38.703
how we're gonna serve
every partner on this list.

08:38.738 --> 08:39.837
Give me that list.

08:39.871 --> 08:41.505
They can consider
themselves served,

08:41.541 --> 08:44.140
because Louis Marlowe Litt
never backs down from a fight.

08:51.150 --> 08:54.018
Federal Correctional
Institution, Danbury.

08:54.053 --> 08:56.387
Yes, I'm--I'm calling
to check on an--

08:56.422 --> 08:57.955
<i>Inmate?</i>

08:57.991 --> 09:01.459
Yeah. His name is
Michael Ross, and he--

09:01.494 --> 09:02.893
I'm sorry, ma'am.

09:02.929 --> 09:04.795
I can't give out information
regarding inmates.

09:04.831 --> 09:06.297
Would you at least be able
to tell me

09:06.332 --> 09:07.832
if he's been processed yet?

09:07.867 --> 09:10.401
<i>If he surrendered himself,</i>
<i>then he has been processed.</i>

09:10.436 --> 09:12.737
Okay, so does that mean
that he's in a cell now or--

09:12.772 --> 09:14.305
<i>Ma'am,</i>
<i>I'm a prison administrator,</i>

09:14.340 --> 09:16.040
<i>not a hotel concierge.</i>

09:16.075 --> 09:17.942
I don't know the whereabouts
of any given inmate

09:17.977 --> 09:19.443
at any given time.

09:19.479 --> 09:22.346
Okay, would you be able
to tell me when I can see him?

09:22.382 --> 09:25.983
Are you his spouse
or immediate family?

09:26.019 --> 09:27.385
No.

09:27.420 --> 09:29.153
Then you'll have to go
through the approval process.

09:29.188 --> 09:31.288
<i>But he doesn't have</i>
<i>any immediate family,</i>

09:31.324 --> 09:33.090
and I'm his fiancée.

09:33.126 --> 09:35.493
And unless you have
a filed marriage certificate,

09:35.528 --> 09:37.028
you'll have to wait
till next month.

09:37.063 --> 09:39.664
Next month?

09:39.699 --> 09:43.167
Um...

09:43.202 --> 09:46.437
Look, am I--am I allowed
to ask your name?

09:46.472 --> 09:50.007
<i>My name is Ruth.</i>

09:50.043 --> 09:52.977
Ruth, Mike and I were...

09:53.012 --> 09:56.514
supposed to be married today,
but we weren't.

09:56.549 --> 09:59.316
<i>And I can't stop thinking</i>
<i>about him,</i>

09:59.352 --> 10:01.052
and I'm not gonna be
able to sleep

10:01.087 --> 10:04.021
unless I know
that he's gonna be okay.

10:04.057 --> 10:05.890
<i>He's in prison, ma'am.</i>

10:05.925 --> 10:09.193
I really couldn't say.

10:09.228 --> 10:10.828
I am sorry.

10:29.015 --> 10:31.382
Nothing like prison blue
to make you realize

10:31.417 --> 10:33.884
the clothes
don't make the man, huh?

10:33.920 --> 10:35.553
- Warden Clark?
- Me?

10:35.588 --> 10:37.054
No.

10:37.090 --> 10:38.956
Who told you you were going
to meet the warden?

10:38.991 --> 10:40.424
Uh, no one.
I-I just thought--

10:40.460 --> 10:42.126
That this was going
to be like a prison movie.

10:42.161 --> 10:43.861
"Put your trust
in the Lord,

10:43.896 --> 10:45.529
but your ass belongs to me"
type shit.

10:45.565 --> 10:47.231
You know "Shawshank"?

10:47.266 --> 10:49.233
Of course you know "Shawshank."
You work in a prison.

10:49.268 --> 10:51.235
No, brother,
I know "Shawshank"

10:51.270 --> 10:53.003
because it's the greatest
movie ever made.

10:53.039 --> 10:55.206
Here...
What's this?

10:55.241 --> 10:58.209
Your psychological
evaluation.

10:58.244 --> 11:00.177
Why do I need
a psychological evaluation?

11:00.213 --> 11:02.446
Because the federal
penitentiary system says you do.

11:02.482 --> 11:04.849
Now, when I get back,
if there's a hole in the mirror

11:04.884 --> 11:07.118
covered by
a Rita Hayworth poster,

11:07.153 --> 11:09.587
I will not be happy.

11:20.299 --> 11:22.366
Okay, Louis, calm down.

11:22.401 --> 11:26.003
You've had a few misfires,
possibly had a stroke,

11:26.038 --> 11:27.538
but you can do this.

11:27.573 --> 11:29.240
You've entered
the requisite information.

11:29.275 --> 11:31.142
You calibrated
the typeface perfectly.

11:31.177 --> 11:33.210
All you have to do
is press "send,"

11:33.246 --> 11:35.780
and those sons of bitches are
about to get Litt the hell up.

11:38.184 --> 11:40.918
God damn mother--
What the hell are you doing?

11:40.953 --> 11:42.219
I'm just doing
a little troubleshooting. Why?

11:42.255 --> 11:44.155
That is a $400,000
piece of hardware,

11:44.190 --> 11:45.923
and you have
no business even--

11:45.958 --> 11:47.458
Wait a second.
What are you still doing here?

11:47.493 --> 11:49.727
What any IT officer
worth his salt would do.

11:49.762 --> 11:51.562
I'm maintaining our system,
so it appears we're still

11:51.597 --> 11:53.097
a functioning law firm
to the outside world.

11:53.132 --> 11:55.232
Can you electronically
serve legal notice

11:55.268 --> 11:57.134
to every partner
in the next two hours?

11:57.170 --> 11:58.869
As long as you've got their
official business addresses,

11:58.905 --> 12:00.838
I can do it
in the next two minutes.

12:00.873 --> 12:03.140
Well, it's a good thing
I have them right here.

12:09.348 --> 12:11.782
Um, no offense, but I'm really
more of a lone ranger.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.250
- Excuse me?
- I can get this done

12:13.286 --> 12:14.518
in a more efficient manner

12:14.554 --> 12:16.520
without you looking
over my shoulder.

12:16.556 --> 12:17.855
Well, that's what I told
my mother

12:17.890 --> 12:19.423
when I looked
at my first "Playboy."

12:19.458 --> 12:21.859
But it didn't happen then,
and it's not gonna happen now.

12:22.929 --> 12:25.029
Well, that doesn't matter
because...

12:25.064 --> 12:27.064
we have a problem.

12:30.770 --> 12:33.204
So you're saying,
in this office,

12:33.239 --> 12:34.872
at any given moment,

12:34.907 --> 12:37.107
there's $100,000 hidden away.

12:37.143 --> 12:39.076
- That's what I'm saying.
- Where?

12:39.111 --> 12:40.244
I'm not telling you.

12:40.279 --> 12:42.012
Whatever the hell you two
are in the middle of,

12:42.048 --> 12:43.113
it's gonna have to wait,

12:43.149 --> 12:45.115
because secretaries
may talk to secretaries,

12:45.151 --> 12:46.317
but liars talk to idiots.

12:46.352 --> 12:48.085
Louis, what the hell
are you talking about?

12:48.120 --> 12:49.320
I'm saying that that list

12:49.355 --> 12:51.388
is a bucket of bullshit,
and the mighty Donna Paulsen--

12:51.424 --> 12:52.923
she doesn't know
her ass from her elbow.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.225
Watch yourself, Louis.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.860
I don't need
to watch myself, Harvey.

12:55.895 --> 12:57.295
See, I don't know
if you've noticed,

12:57.330 --> 12:59.129
but we're being sued
for a $100 million.

12:59.165 --> 13:01.131
The partners are gone,
and we can't stop them.

13:01.167 --> 13:02.499
Maybe we don't have
to stop them.

13:02.535 --> 13:03.934
What are you saying?

13:03.970 --> 13:05.669
What I want to know right now
is what we're all worth.

13:05.705 --> 13:06.837
What, are you kidding?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.172
Why don't you just jam
a cattle prod up my ass?

13:08.207 --> 13:09.340
It would be less invasive.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.641
I'll jam my fist
in your face

13:10.676 --> 13:12.176
if you don't start getting
with the program.

13:12.211 --> 13:14.178
There you go, resorting
to violence, like you always do.

13:14.213 --> 13:15.980
Because you don't want to admit
this whole thing

13:16.015 --> 13:17.781
is your fault
in the first place.

13:17.817 --> 13:20.017
My fault?
If I hadn't brought Mike in,

13:20.052 --> 13:21.785
you'd still be here
sniveling around

13:21.821 --> 13:23.187
like a goddamn
junior partner.

13:23.222 --> 13:24.555
And if I hadn't given
Donna back to you,

13:24.590 --> 13:25.689
you'd still be
having panic attacks

13:25.725 --> 13:26.757
like a goddamn little girl.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.759
- Louis!
- You smug son of a bitch.

13:28.794 --> 13:31.462
That's enough!

13:31.497 --> 13:33.364
I just watched the man
that I love go to prison

13:33.399 --> 13:35.432
so none of you have to.

13:35.468 --> 13:37.968
And it hasn't been
five minutes...

13:39.739 --> 13:41.906
And you're already
ripping each other apart.

13:41.941 --> 13:43.607
- Rachel--
- Let me finish.

13:43.643 --> 13:47.378
I thought I wanted
to be alone tonight.

13:47.413 --> 13:50.147
And then I realized
that I didn't,

13:50.182 --> 13:53.918
because I wanted to be
with my family.

13:53.953 --> 13:56.387
But if you can't keep it
together tonight...

13:56.422 --> 14:00.658
of all nights, then as far
as I'm concerned...

14:00.693 --> 14:03.160
you can all rot in hell.

14:06.265 --> 14:08.832
Well, I'm gonna say
what she won't.

14:08.868 --> 14:10.334
This is all on you.

14:10.369 --> 14:13.504
Louis, this is the last place
I wanted to be tonight too,

14:13.539 --> 14:16.607
but I came back here
to save my firm anyway.

14:16.642 --> 14:19.143
But if you're gonna be
the same old Louis

14:19.178 --> 14:21.145
and we're going to do
the same old dance,

14:21.180 --> 14:25.382
then maybe you and this firm
can both go rot in hell.

14:44.563 --> 14:46.897
Louis, I don't want
to hear it.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.766
Well, that's good,
because I'm not here to say it.

14:48.801 --> 14:50.634
Are you saying you didn't
come down here

14:50.670 --> 14:52.102
to tell me Harvey
can go to hell?

14:52.138 --> 14:54.738
I'm saying I came down here
to tell you,

14:54.774 --> 14:57.408
if Harvey wants to go...

14:57.443 --> 14:59.243
we should let him.
Oh, Louis.

14:59.278 --> 15:03.714
Jessica, you once told me,
no matter what happens,

15:03.749 --> 15:07.918
Pearson will always consider
Litt her partner,

15:07.954 --> 15:12.056
which means whatever happens
with Harvey...

15:12.091 --> 15:14.091
we can do this together.

15:16.162 --> 15:19.530
What do you say--
you and me?

15:19.565 --> 15:23.400
Pearson Litt.

15:23.436 --> 15:25.836
Wow.
You say no.

15:25.872 --> 15:27.371
- No, Louis--
- I should have known.

15:27.406 --> 15:29.173
You never wanted me.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.075
All you ever wanted
was your precious Harvey.

15:31.110 --> 15:35.246
Louis, you have no idea
what I want.

15:35.281 --> 15:37.314
And my hesitation has nothing
to do with you.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.483
Then what exactly
does it have to do with?

15:39.518 --> 15:41.752
Louis...

15:41.787 --> 15:45.823
I have put everything I have
into keeping this firm afloat

15:45.858 --> 15:48.325
for as long
as I can remember.

15:48.361 --> 15:50.394
Well, now look around you.

15:50.429 --> 15:53.297
The ship isn't sinking.
It sunk.

15:53.332 --> 15:55.165
And I don't know
if I have it in me

15:55.201 --> 15:58.636
to pull it back up
from the bottom of the ocean.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.413
- Finally.
- Excuse me?

16:09.448 --> 16:12.249
They came and took
that thing away three hours ago.

16:12.285 --> 16:14.251
I've been sitting here
twiddling my thumbs ever since.

16:14.287 --> 16:15.886
You were not twiddling
your thumbs.

16:15.922 --> 16:18.255
You were waiting for me to go
over the results of that thing.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.891
And the results are
you are full of shit.

16:20.927 --> 16:22.393
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

16:22.428 --> 16:24.161
I answered every one
of those questions honestly.

16:24.196 --> 16:25.496
I didn't say you didn't.

16:25.531 --> 16:27.298
Well, in that case,
I guess you didn't get the memo.

16:27.333 --> 16:28.766
We're in a prison
filled with con men.

16:28.801 --> 16:30.234
Everyone here
is full of shit.

16:30.269 --> 16:32.836
And the difference between you
and them is they know they are.

16:32.872 --> 16:34.238
What does that even mean?

16:34.273 --> 16:36.140
It means that they know
they don't have the patience

16:36.175 --> 16:38.075
to earn what they want,

16:38.110 --> 16:40.277
and that's why they go out
and steal it from other people.

16:40.313 --> 16:42.313
So that's why you left me
in here all that time,

16:42.348 --> 16:44.214
just to prove
that I have no patience.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.951
Evaluation number two--
narcissistic tendencies.

16:46.986 --> 16:49.119
The world does not revolve
around you.

16:49.155 --> 16:51.355
You know what?
I don't have to listen to this.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.324
No, you don't, because
my day is done.

16:53.359 --> 16:57.094
And I'm going to go home,
pour myself a cold beer

16:57.129 --> 17:00.364
while you get settled in cell 42
on the south end of D block.

17:00.399 --> 17:03.968
Yeah, I get it.

17:04.002 --> 17:06.270
I'm no longer Mike Ross.

17:06.305 --> 17:10.907
I'm just inmate
number 53296.

17:10.943 --> 17:13.277
No, you're still
Mike Ross.

17:13.311 --> 17:16.079
But my job is to help you become
a better version of him

17:16.115 --> 17:18.115
when you leave
than when you came in.

17:18.150 --> 17:20.384
And if you trust me,
that just might happen.

17:20.419 --> 17:21.652
Trust you?

17:21.686 --> 17:24.188
You came in here before
acting like you were on my side.

17:24.223 --> 17:26.156
Whoa, let's get
one thing straight.

17:26.192 --> 17:27.858
I didn't act anything.

17:27.893 --> 17:29.159
You waltzed in here thinking

17:29.195 --> 17:30.861
this was gonna be
like some prison movie.

17:30.896 --> 17:33.864
Well, it's not,
so get that through your head.

17:33.899 --> 17:36.166
It's not a movie, brother.

17:36.202 --> 17:38.769
It's just prison.

17:41.741 --> 17:45.309
Don't you dare
push that button.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.077
You're not leaving, Harvey,
not tonight.

17:47.113 --> 17:49.346
- Yes, I am.
- Well, if you really mean that,

17:49.382 --> 17:50.948
then you're not the man
I thought you were.

17:50.983 --> 17:52.049
What did you
just say to me?

17:52.084 --> 17:54.118
I said that
underneath that expensive suit

17:54.153 --> 17:56.520
and that perfect record
is a coward ready to run

17:56.555 --> 17:58.255
from one of the biggest
fights of his life.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.324
I am not running
from anything, Donna,

18:00.359 --> 18:01.599
and I don't need
this right now.

18:01.627 --> 18:03.394
No, Harvey, right now
is exactly when you need this,

18:03.429 --> 18:04.995
because tomorrow's
gonna be too late.

18:05.031 --> 18:05.996
I know what I'm doing.

18:06.032 --> 18:07.331
Then why don't you
enlighten me?

18:07.366 --> 18:09.033
Because I, for one,

18:09.068 --> 18:10.567
would love to know
exactly what you're doing.

18:10.603 --> 18:13.670
I'm gonna go the hell home
and never look back.

18:13.706 --> 18:15.506
And what about tomorrow?

18:15.541 --> 18:16.707
I don't care
about tomorrow.

18:16.742 --> 18:18.409
Well, maybe you should start
caring about tomorrow,

18:18.444 --> 18:19.510
because if you don't,

18:19.545 --> 18:21.045
you're gonna wake up
three weeks from now,

18:21.080 --> 18:22.546
and you're gonna realize
that this was

18:22.581 --> 18:24.214
the biggest mistake
of your life,

18:24.250 --> 18:25.549
and all you did was give up

18:25.584 --> 18:27.284
exactly what Mike went
to prison to save.

18:27.319 --> 18:29.520
Mike did not go to prison
to save this goddamn firm.

18:29.555 --> 18:33.157
No, Harvey,
he went to prison to save us.

18:33.192 --> 18:35.092
And now you're
walking out on us.

18:35.127 --> 18:37.061
And if you're gonna do that,
then tell me,

18:37.096 --> 18:38.896
what did he save us for?

19:16.335 --> 19:18.268
<i>Let's get</i>
<i>one thing straight.</i>

19:18.304 --> 19:19.903
<i>You waltzed in here thinking</i>

19:19.939 --> 19:22.039
<i>this was gonna be</i>
<i>like a prison movie.</i>

19:22.074 --> 19:24.074
<i>Well, it's not.</i>

19:24.110 --> 19:25.375
Ross.

19:25.411 --> 19:27.044
<i>It's not a movie, brother.</i>

19:27.079 --> 19:30.347
<i>It's just prison.</i>
<i>It's just prison.</i>

19:30.382 --> 19:32.416
Ross.

19:35.554 --> 19:39.890
Did you hear me?

19:39.925 --> 19:42.292
We gonna have trouble
your first night?

19:42.328 --> 19:45.162
- No.
- Then get in there.

19:51.103 --> 19:53.303
One more thing...

19:53.339 --> 19:56.406
you're not authorized to leave
this cell the rest of the night.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.304
Jessica, I'm sorry.
I didn't--

20:16.340 --> 20:19.207
You know, this used to
be my desk.

20:19.243 --> 20:21.309
Different desk,
same spot.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.212
Jackson was there,
Burns was there,

20:24.248 --> 20:26.815
and Kleiman was by the door.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.951
He hated being by the door.

20:29.987 --> 20:31.853
I don't know
any of those names.

20:31.889 --> 20:34.289
Because they got out
a long time ago,

20:34.324 --> 20:37.893
because this life
isn't for everyone.

20:37.928 --> 20:42.097
And it's harder on some
than it is on others.

20:42.132 --> 20:45.901
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that...

20:45.936 --> 20:50.172
for women,
the rules are different.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.574
You can't be everyone's friend
and invite them to tea

20:52.609 --> 20:54.676
because...

20:54.711 --> 20:57.045
warm means you're weak.

20:59.249 --> 21:01.283
I wasn't gonna be weak.

21:01.318 --> 21:03.151
But now the flip side
to that is,

21:03.187 --> 21:06.154
if you're strong,
they think you're cold.

21:06.190 --> 21:09.858
And that's
why they're all gone...

21:09.893 --> 21:12.527
because they see me as...

21:12.563 --> 21:17.232
as unfeeling
and manipulative.

21:18.969 --> 21:21.136
I'm tired of it.

21:21.171 --> 21:22.337
Well, they're wrong.

21:22.372 --> 21:23.338
You're just saying that

21:23.373 --> 21:24.873
because you're seeing me
like this.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.841
No, that has nothing
to do with it.

21:26.877 --> 21:28.043
My dad told me

21:28.078 --> 21:30.045
that the only reason he came
to the church today

21:30.080 --> 21:31.846
was because you told him
if he didn't,

21:31.882 --> 21:33.582
he would lose me forever.

21:33.617 --> 21:35.817
And you didn't do that
because you were trying

21:35.852 --> 21:38.220
to manipulate some situation.

21:38.255 --> 21:42.123
You did it
because you care.

21:42.159 --> 21:44.960
And because you did it,

21:44.995 --> 21:47.362
I will be loyal
to you forever.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.737
What can I do
for you, Harvey?

21:55.772 --> 22:00.642
I came to tell you
that I'm sorry.

22:00.677 --> 22:02.344
You should be.

22:02.379 --> 22:04.980
I know.

22:05.015 --> 22:07.249
So you gonna give me
a tongue lashing,

22:07.284 --> 22:10.552
or you want to figure out how
we can get out of this jackpot?

22:13.590 --> 22:18.193
I think that right now
you and me and Louis

22:18.228 --> 22:20.829
should get in a room
and smoke a peace pipe.

22:20.864 --> 22:22.664
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

22:22.699 --> 22:24.032
I sure as hell am.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.700
And where exactly
are we gonna get that shit

22:25.736 --> 22:27.168
this late at night?

22:27.204 --> 22:29.104
'Cause the coffee cart guy
is long gone.

22:29.139 --> 22:32.040
It just so happens I like
to brew my own coffee

22:32.075 --> 22:33.308
from time to time.

22:33.343 --> 22:37.212
I'm gonna go get
a drink.

22:37.247 --> 22:40.181
That stuff's illegal,
you know.

22:50.460 --> 22:53.261
- Put that down.
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

22:53.297 --> 22:55.263
I didn't mean to--
Touch my stuff?

22:55.299 --> 22:58.633
Funny, I didn't see the picture
jump into your hands by itself.

22:58.669 --> 22:59.801
Look, I was just--

22:59.836 --> 23:01.736
Relax,
I'm just giving you shit.

23:01.772 --> 23:05.106
That's my little nephew--
sweet kid,

23:05.142 --> 23:08.276
dumb as a box of rocks.

23:08.312 --> 23:10.745
Welcome to Danbury.
What's your name?

23:10.781 --> 23:14.082
Mike. Mike Ross.

23:14.117 --> 23:17.585
Frank Gallo.

23:17.621 --> 23:19.421
Well, Mike, looks like
we're gonna be sharing

23:19.456 --> 23:22.223
this little condo
for a while, huh?

23:22.259 --> 23:25.593
Feel like telling me
what you're in for?

23:25.629 --> 23:28.096
I get it. You don't know
if you can trust me.

23:28.131 --> 23:31.633
Listen, truth is, you shouldn't
trust anybody in here.

23:31.668 --> 23:33.668
Except I just asked
what you did,

23:33.704 --> 23:36.871
and they obviously already
caught you, so what's the harm?

23:36.907 --> 23:38.273
Well, if there's no harm,

23:38.308 --> 23:39.708
then why don't you tell me
what you're in for?

23:39.743 --> 23:40.842
That could take a while.

23:40.877 --> 23:41.976
I don't know about you,

23:42.012 --> 23:43.545
but I'm free
for the next two years.

23:43.580 --> 23:45.213
Ah, careful.

23:45.248 --> 23:47.582
See, now you've told me
how long you're in for.

23:47.617 --> 23:48.917
Starts there, ends with you

23:48.952 --> 23:52.721
telling me you were born
a poor black child.

23:52.756 --> 23:54.956
- You know "The Jerk"?
- Yeah, you know "The Jerk"?

23:54.991 --> 23:56.691
Yeah, I watched a lot
of movies growing up.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.294
Ah, we watch a lot
of movies in here.

23:59.329 --> 24:01.262
All right, you want
to know my story?

24:01.298 --> 24:04.632
It starts long before
I did what I did,

24:04.668 --> 24:07.235
because I wasn't born
a poor black child,

24:07.270 --> 24:09.237
but I was born poor,

24:09.272 --> 24:12.607
which made me susceptible
to wanting to be rich.

24:17.781 --> 24:19.280
Of course I'm thinking
about myself.

24:19.316 --> 24:20.682
What, you wouldn't?

24:20.717 --> 24:22.684
Please, you'd throw
a giraffe off of Noah's Ark

24:22.719 --> 24:24.052
just to save
your sorry ass.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.527
The world's probably
without unicorns

24:25.555 --> 24:27.021
because of one
of your ancestors, and I--

24:27.057 --> 24:29.257
Will you just let me finish
a thought, for God's sake?

24:29.292 --> 24:32.260
Louis?
What exactly are you doing?

24:32.295 --> 24:34.028
Well, what does
it look like I'm doing?

24:34.064 --> 24:35.997
I'm having a discussion
about the fate of the firm

24:36.032 --> 24:37.632
with my
dead secretary's ashes.

24:37.667 --> 24:39.768
Well, as long as
it's not something weird.

24:42.205 --> 24:44.572
What exactly have you two been
doing the last half hour?

24:44.608 --> 24:46.541
The same thing
you're about to do.

24:46.576 --> 24:48.176
No way, I'm not doing
the Mary Jane.

24:48.211 --> 24:50.145
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not huffing and puffing.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.113
- Louis, it's the only way.
- No, I'm not doing the dirty.

24:52.149 --> 24:54.048
It's okay.
I got this.

24:54.084 --> 24:55.550
I mean, if Louis doesn't want
to smoke it, maybe Norma does.

24:55.585 --> 24:57.619
- Oh, don't you dare.
- Relax, Louis.

24:57.654 --> 24:59.154
It's not like
it's gonna kill her.

24:59.189 --> 25:00.688
Harvey, that is
not funny, okay?

25:00.724 --> 25:02.124
You're gonna get ashes
in her ashes.

25:02.159 --> 25:03.992
Then why don't you
just smoke it yourself?

25:04.027 --> 25:06.161
- Put that out.
- Nope.

25:06.196 --> 25:08.696
I'm gonna light this joint
on the count of one...

25:08.732 --> 25:10.098
- Harvey, I'm telling you.
- Two...

25:10.133 --> 25:11.299
- Harvey!
- Three.

25:17.674 --> 25:18.940
Did you
pull your back out?

25:18.975 --> 25:20.775
Give me the goddamn thing.

25:26.082 --> 25:27.248
Jesus Christ.

25:27.284 --> 25:28.850
That's the thing
about computers.

25:28.885 --> 25:30.185
You can delete
whatever you want,

25:30.220 --> 25:31.453
but it's never really gone.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.988
So, if you had just
stopped one trade sooner,

25:34.024 --> 25:35.757
they might never have
even caught you.

25:35.792 --> 25:38.526
Yeah, I could've stopped five,
four, three trades sooner.

25:38.562 --> 25:40.528
They might not have.
But how do you know?

25:40.564 --> 25:41.696
I'll tell you
how you know.

25:41.731 --> 25:43.364
You stop when you have
enough money

25:43.400 --> 25:45.033
to put your kids
through college.

25:45.068 --> 25:48.570
Yeah, but what college?

25:48.605 --> 25:51.673
And what if they want
to go to med school?

25:51.708 --> 25:53.575
And what if they need a car?

25:53.610 --> 25:55.109
And then
somewhere along the way,

25:55.145 --> 25:57.011
you stop thinking
about if they need a car,

25:57.047 --> 25:59.614
and you start thinking,
"I need a car."

25:59.649 --> 26:01.082
And that's when
you get caught,

26:01.117 --> 26:04.786
because whether you want
to admit it to yourself or not,

26:04.821 --> 26:08.690
you were never thinking
about them in first place.

26:08.725 --> 26:11.693
And whether you
were or weren't,

26:11.728 --> 26:15.430
once you start,
you don't stop.

26:16.633 --> 26:18.600
That's one hell
of a story, Frank.

26:18.635 --> 26:21.069
Yeah, well,
this is prison.

26:21.104 --> 26:25.173
Everyone's got
a hell of a story.

26:25.208 --> 26:28.643
Anyway, that's enough
for one night.

26:28.678 --> 26:30.678
I'm gonna go to bed.

26:33.116 --> 26:36.618
My story started
with my grandmother.

26:36.653 --> 26:38.219
She was sick,

26:38.255 --> 26:41.656
and she needed money...

26:41.691 --> 26:44.392
and I found a way
to get it for her.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.367
Holy shit.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.602
This is
the best thing ever.

26:54.638 --> 26:57.171
I love the both of you
so much.

26:57.207 --> 27:00.542
- This is your doing.
- Harvey, we're making progress.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.011
Holy shit. This is
the best egg roll ever.

27:03.046 --> 27:04.546
Jesus Christ,
get me out of here.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.180
This is so awesome.

27:06.216 --> 27:07.682
I mean, I haven't been
this stress-free

27:07.717 --> 27:10.985
since I took gold
in the Math-lympics

27:11.021 --> 27:12.954
and Esther went to fat camp
in the same week.

27:12.989 --> 27:14.122
Esther went to fat camp?

27:14.157 --> 27:15.690
They called it
Violin All-Stars,

27:15.725 --> 27:17.559
but we all know
what that's code for.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.628
And if you so much as picture
her in a school-girl outfit.

27:20.664 --> 27:22.530
Come on, Louis,
we're all feeling good.

27:22.566 --> 27:23.765
You telling me
you never slipped up

27:23.800 --> 27:25.600
and had an inappropriate
relationship?

27:25.635 --> 27:27.402
Louis, I do not want
to know the answer to that.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.471
I did. It was the most
shameful night of my life.

27:30.507 --> 27:31.606
Harvey, don't--

27:31.641 --> 27:32.874
What exactly was so shameful
about it?

27:32.909 --> 27:35.176
Well, she was a paralegal,

27:35.211 --> 27:37.211
and I took mud with her.

27:37.247 --> 27:38.713
I don't understand.

27:38.748 --> 27:40.949
Are you saying you sullied
her reputation?

27:40.984 --> 27:43.151
No, I'm saying I sullied
the concept of mud.

27:43.186 --> 27:44.619
What the hell
are you talking about?

27:44.654 --> 27:46.020
What, do I need
a bullhorn?

27:46.056 --> 27:48.089
I had a premature muddification.
What the hell does that mean?

27:48.124 --> 27:49.591
I think we all know
what that means.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.225
It means I couldn't
hold my mud.

27:51.261 --> 27:54.262
I still don't know
what that means.

27:54.297 --> 27:56.598
Did you take a shit in the mud?
No, that's disgusting.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.000
Well, what part of this
conversation isn't disgusting?

27:59.035 --> 28:01.469
I know I'm gonna regret
asking this.

28:01.504 --> 28:02.770
Who exactly was it?

28:02.806 --> 28:04.105
I cannot tell you
that information.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.940
Okay, good, because
the truth is, I don't--

28:05.976 --> 28:07.241
It was Missy Dietler.

28:07.277 --> 28:08.710
Louis, I'm gonna ask you
a question.

28:08.745 --> 28:11.045
I want you
to tell me the truth.

28:11.081 --> 28:13.081
Does Missy Dietler know
you couldn't hold your mud?

28:13.116 --> 28:14.116
Oh, heavens no.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.316
The Turkish silt
was thick enough

28:15.352 --> 28:16.651
to prevent her
from feeling it, so...

28:16.686 --> 28:20.688
Was it thick enough to hide
you wanting to go sleep after?

28:20.724 --> 28:22.123
My God, she knew.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.592
I got news for you, Louis.
They always know.

28:24.628 --> 28:28.229
Oh, you're so right.

28:28.264 --> 28:31.666
You're so right.

28:31.701 --> 28:32.834
She--

28:32.869 --> 28:34.836
I need
15 minutes to myself.

28:43.023 --> 28:46.725
And that's it.

28:46.761 --> 28:48.527
I cut a deal,
and now I'm here.

28:48.563 --> 28:49.895
Wait a second.

28:49.931 --> 28:52.097
If you're a fake lawyer,
they had to give you a chance

28:52.133 --> 28:54.600
to turn on someone
to get out of it.

28:54.635 --> 28:56.569
They did.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.470
So why the hell
didn't you do it?

28:58.506 --> 29:00.673
Because I wouldn't have been
able to live with myself.

29:00.708 --> 29:04.043
Somebody out there
owes you a lot.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.178
Yeah, well...

29:06.214 --> 29:08.047
I owe him a lot too.

29:08.082 --> 29:10.616
So, what, you're--

29:10.651 --> 29:14.119
you're like a-a good guy
or something?

29:16.724 --> 29:17.923
Am I?

29:17.959 --> 29:19.158
What do you mean?

29:19.193 --> 29:21.527
I left the woman I love
at the altar today.

29:21.562 --> 29:22.761
Why'd you do that?

29:22.797 --> 29:24.396
Because I didn't want
to chain her to me

29:24.432 --> 29:29.068
if there was even the chance
that she would regret it.

29:29.103 --> 29:32.538
Then, yeah,
you're a good guy.

29:32.573 --> 29:34.139
Thanks, Frank.

29:36.210 --> 29:39.511
One thing about everyone
being gone...

29:39.547 --> 29:42.548
we got the run
of the place.

29:42.583 --> 29:45.451
I never knew what the ceiling
looked like in here.

29:48.789 --> 29:51.457
It's like
"The Breakfast Club."

29:51.492 --> 29:53.892
Do you ever not
quote a movie?

29:53.928 --> 29:55.728
No, and you got a problem
with that, frankly, my dear,

29:55.763 --> 29:57.129
I don't give a damn.

29:57.164 --> 30:00.165
You're an idiot.

30:00.201 --> 30:02.268
You think Louis is gonna
be okay with me now?

30:03.504 --> 30:05.738
I think we're about
to find out.

30:05.773 --> 30:07.906
Harvey,
what I was saying before...

30:07.942 --> 30:09.208
You don't need
to say anything, Louis.

30:09.243 --> 30:10.442
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

30:10.478 --> 30:12.177
That's not what
I was gonna say.

30:12.213 --> 30:14.113
It's not the only inappropriate
relationship I ever had.

30:14.148 --> 30:16.515
I recorded you saying
that you knew about Mike,

30:16.550 --> 30:18.450
and I almost gave it
to Anita Gibbs.

30:18.486 --> 30:20.586
- Did you know about this?
- No.

30:20.621 --> 30:22.087
But I suspected
when he tried to get me

30:22.123 --> 30:24.056
to turn you in
to Gibbs with him.

30:24.091 --> 30:25.991
And what exactly was
your response to that request?

30:26.027 --> 30:27.493
She said we didn't need
to do that,

30:27.528 --> 30:31.497
and if it came to it, you would
take the bullet for both of us.

30:31.532 --> 30:34.500
- I would have.
- I'm sorry, Harvey.

30:34.535 --> 30:36.001
I almost
ruined your life.

30:36.037 --> 30:37.670
You don't need
to be sorry, Louis.

30:37.705 --> 30:40.773
The truth is, I'm the one
that ruined all of our lives,

30:40.808 --> 30:43.509
when I hired Mike.

30:43.544 --> 30:47.579
And I never apologized
to either one of you for it,

30:47.615 --> 30:50.649
but I will now.

30:50.685 --> 30:53.052
I'm sorry.

30:53.087 --> 30:54.553
So...

30:54.588 --> 30:58.123
we good?

30:58.159 --> 31:00.726
We're good.

31:00.761 --> 31:03.562
All right, now that the two
of you have made peace,

31:03.597 --> 31:05.397
let's figure out
how we're gonna win this war,

31:05.433 --> 31:08.167
which starts with knowing how
much we have in our war chest.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.468
What exactly
does that mean?

31:09.503 --> 31:10.736
It means it's time

31:10.771 --> 31:13.072
to answer the question
that she asked two hours ago.

31:13.107 --> 31:14.273
How much money do we have?

31:14.308 --> 31:15.574
This again?

31:15.609 --> 31:17.209
Louis, after everything
we've been through tonight,

31:17.244 --> 31:18.510
how hard could it be
for us to write down

31:18.546 --> 31:20.112
how much we're worth
right now?

31:20.147 --> 31:22.081
I need another 15 minutes
to myself.

31:22.116 --> 31:25.050
- Again?
- Aw, Harvey, let him go.

31:25.086 --> 31:27.052
He probably doesn't have
as much as we do,

31:27.088 --> 31:28.721
and it's a vulnerable thing
for him.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.089
"Vulnerable"?

31:30.124 --> 31:32.825
He just told us he jerked off
in the mud an hour ago.

31:32.860 --> 31:35.427
You don't think he's gonna do
that right now, do you?

31:35.463 --> 31:36.695
Based on
what he told us,

31:36.731 --> 31:39.098
he doesn't need
15 minutes for that.

31:47.541 --> 31:49.208
You want to call her?

31:51.312 --> 31:52.378
What?

31:52.413 --> 31:54.613
Your fiancée,
you want to call her?

31:54.648 --> 31:56.281
What are you
talking about?

31:56.317 --> 31:59.017
I'm talking about
my first night in here.

31:59.053 --> 32:01.086
I remember thinking
what I wouldn't give

32:01.122 --> 32:03.155
to let Jennifer know
I was okay.

32:03.190 --> 32:06.458
The thing is, I couldn't,
but you can.

32:06.494 --> 32:08.460
I thought we weren't allowed
to have phones in here.

32:08.496 --> 32:11.563
Yeah, well, I wasn't allowed
to make inside trades either.

32:11.599 --> 32:15.033
But I did,
and now I'm in here.

32:15.069 --> 32:18.437
What else are they
gonna do?

32:18.472 --> 32:21.440
Uh, thanks, but...

32:21.475 --> 32:23.542
I just...

32:23.577 --> 32:26.578
I just can't right now.

32:26.614 --> 32:30.416
Whenever you want,
phone's right here.

32:30.451 --> 32:33.118
Let's try to get
some shut-eye, man.

32:40.761 --> 32:42.494
You okay?

32:42.530 --> 32:45.597
He's everywhere.

32:45.633 --> 32:49.168
He's all around
here, Donna.

32:49.203 --> 32:51.069
The first place
we met was down the hallway.

32:51.105 --> 32:53.705
And the first time we kissed
was in the library.

32:53.741 --> 32:57.443
And I met his grandmother
50 feet from here.

32:57.478 --> 32:59.711
And right here,
he told me the truth.

32:59.747 --> 33:01.280
- Rachel--
- He was standing

33:01.315 --> 33:03.048
right where you are,
and I was upset with him

33:03.083 --> 33:05.751
about something
that I don't even remember.

33:05.786 --> 33:10.189
And then he told me that he had
lost everyone in his life,

33:10.224 --> 33:12.758
and then he told me
he was a fraud.

33:15.062 --> 33:17.896
And then we...
Mm.

33:20.067 --> 33:23.569
- You're gonna get through this.
- I know.

33:23.604 --> 33:25.003
I just wish I could see him.

33:25.039 --> 33:26.505
What do you mean?
You can see him.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.607
No, I can't.
I called the prison.

33:28.642 --> 33:30.042
You called
the prison tonight?

33:30.077 --> 33:32.211
Yes, because I wanted
to know if he was okay.

33:32.246 --> 33:34.746
And they...

33:34.782 --> 33:37.149
they wouldn't give me
any information.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.084
So then I asked them
about visitation,

33:39.119 --> 33:40.919
and they said
that I had to wait,

33:40.955 --> 33:42.754
and I had to get
on a list, and--

33:42.790 --> 33:44.423
How long?

33:44.458 --> 33:47.025
At least a month.

33:47.061 --> 33:50.696
I don't know what to say.

33:50.731 --> 33:53.632
You always know
what to say.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.201
Not this time.

34:01.742 --> 34:02.975
Excuse me, ladies.

34:03.010 --> 34:05.043
Sorry to interrupt, but I think
we might have a problem.

34:05.079 --> 34:08.413
- What is it, Benjamin?
- We're being hacked.

34:15.489 --> 34:18.023
Oh, that's a tidy little sum
you got there.

34:18.058 --> 34:19.725
You're not doing
so bad yourself.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.059
No, I am not.

34:21.094 --> 34:23.061
Not bad for two people
that came from nothing.

34:23.097 --> 34:25.163
I didn't come from nothing,
and you know it.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.100
Bet it still feels pretty good
to write that number down.

34:28.135 --> 34:30.369
Oh, it sure does.

34:31.938 --> 34:33.539
You're still a little high,
aren't you?

34:33.574 --> 34:35.641
I sure am.

34:35.676 --> 34:37.743
There. You wanted you
wanted to know my net worth.

34:37.777 --> 34:39.610
You got it.

34:39.647 --> 34:41.580
- Holy shit.
- Who are you?

34:41.614 --> 34:43.549
- Are you a king?
- No, I'm just not an idiot.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.050
What the hell have you been
doing with your money?

34:45.085 --> 34:46.451
Louis, we're not
exactly poor.

34:46.487 --> 34:48.219
That's what Bolivia says
to the U.S.,

34:48.255 --> 34:49.987
but if NATO goes to war,
they're not kicking in dick.

34:50.024 --> 34:51.757
Well, if you're so damn rich,
why didn't you pony up

34:51.792 --> 34:53.692
for Donna's salary
when you had the chance?

34:53.726 --> 34:55.427
Do you even know how to spell
"fiscal responsibility"?

34:55.462 --> 34:56.594
I know how
to spell "cheap."

34:56.630 --> 34:57.863
All right, that's enough.

34:57.898 --> 34:59.131
At least now we know

34:59.166 --> 35:00.699
we have enough to fund
ourselves for a while.

35:00.734 --> 35:02.501
You guys have
two rich uncles?

35:02.536 --> 35:04.870
'Cause I'm not carrying your
asses if this thing drags out.

35:04.905 --> 35:06.538
Louis, this is a team effort,
and I swear to God,

35:06.574 --> 35:07.873
if you don't come
through on this--

35:07.908 --> 35:09.675
I hate to interrupt
your "Breakfast Club" moment,

35:09.710 --> 35:10.809
but you need to sober up.

35:10.844 --> 35:12.544
- Donna, what is it?
- According to Benjamin,

35:12.580 --> 35:14.346
the partners
didn't just leave.

35:14.381 --> 35:16.915
They're coming after
every client we have.

35:21.833 --> 35:23.567
All right,
give me an update

35:23.603 --> 35:25.069
and give it to me
in plain English.

35:25.104 --> 35:26.437
I was able to shut
the hack down,

35:26.472 --> 35:28.172
but not before they got all
three of your clients' files.

35:28.207 --> 35:29.874
Shit, they're trying to put us
in the ground tonight.

35:29.909 --> 35:31.342
Then we have to stop it
before it even gets started.

35:31.377 --> 35:32.443
Well, the only problem
with that

35:32.478 --> 35:33.677
is that we don't know
what bullshit story

35:33.713 --> 35:35.113
they're out there
selling right now.

35:35.147 --> 35:37.281
Then we need to figure it out.
We need to figure it out fast.

35:37.316 --> 35:39.350
It's the main line.

35:39.385 --> 35:40.951
What should we do?

35:40.987 --> 35:42.553
Donna.

35:45.258 --> 35:48.526
Pearson Specter Litt,
may I help you?

35:48.561 --> 35:51.061
One moment, please.

35:51.097 --> 35:52.663
It's for you.
It's Jim Reynolds.

35:52.698 --> 35:54.298
That's Decker Pharmaceutical.
Don't take it. He's leaving us.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.900
Louis,
he's my oldest client.

35:55.935 --> 35:57.234
I'm not ducking his call.

35:57.270 --> 36:00.104
- Jessica.
- Put him on speaker.

36:00.139 --> 36:01.405
Jim, how can I help you?

36:01.440 --> 36:03.474
<i>You can tell me</i>
<i>what's going on there.</i>

36:03.509 --> 36:05.109
<i>I've been hearing</i>
<i>a lot of rumors,</i>

36:05.144 --> 36:08.279
<i>and I need to hear</i>
<i>the truth from you.</i>

36:08.314 --> 36:10.915
All right, Jim,
you want to hear the truth?

36:10.950 --> 36:13.484
We went out for the afternoon,
and when we got back,

36:13.519 --> 36:15.452
every partner
in the place was gone.

36:15.488 --> 36:16.987
But I'm telling you,

36:17.023 --> 36:18.822
the name partners
are still here,

36:18.858 --> 36:21.992
and we can still service you
and the board.

36:22.028 --> 36:23.494
<i>I know you can.</i>

36:23.529 --> 36:25.829
Then you're not calling to say
that you're leaving us?

36:25.865 --> 36:27.965
<i>I was calling to tell you</i>
<i>I've been sent notice.</i>

36:28.000 --> 36:29.366
<i>They're bifurcating your firm,</i>

36:29.402 --> 36:31.101
<i>and the other partners</i>
<i>have nothing to do</i>

36:31.137 --> 36:32.937
<i>with Pearson Specter Litt</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

36:32.972 --> 36:35.172
Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it,
and I won't forget it.

36:35.207 --> 36:36.941
<i>Jessica, if you're not back</i>
<i>on your feet</i>

36:36.976 --> 36:38.309
<i>by the end of the month,</i>

36:38.344 --> 36:39.977
<i>I won't be able</i>
<i>to hold off the board.</i>

36:40.012 --> 36:41.478
If we're not back
by the end of the month,

36:41.514 --> 36:44.615
I will call the board
and resign from service myself.

36:46.419 --> 36:47.985
Isn't this good?
They're not trying to poach.

36:48.020 --> 36:49.420
- It's just as bad.
- What do you mean?

36:49.455 --> 36:51.789
It means they don't care
about clients right now.

36:51.824 --> 36:52.957
They're bifurcating the firm

36:52.992 --> 36:54.758
because they want
their buy-ins back.

36:54.794 --> 36:56.460
And they hacked us to get
our clients' information

36:56.495 --> 36:58.028
so that they could
deliver notice.

36:58.064 --> 36:59.930
We need to move the money
that we have

36:59.966 --> 37:01.265
in every account by tomorrow.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.168
We don't need to move it.
We need to use it.

37:04.203 --> 37:06.637
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

37:06.672 --> 37:08.339
you're a genius.

37:08.374 --> 37:10.140
What are you talking about?

37:10.176 --> 37:11.308
We can use their buy-ins

37:11.344 --> 37:12.943
to settle
the class-action lawsuits.

37:12.979 --> 37:14.912
And they won't be able
to sue us for the money back

37:14.947 --> 37:17.047
because it'll already
be gone.

37:17.083 --> 37:20.217
You really are a genius.

37:20.252 --> 37:22.353
Thanks, Harvey.

37:22.388 --> 37:24.321
Uh, might I point out
that I was the one

37:24.357 --> 37:25.856
that brought the hacking
to your attention

37:25.891 --> 37:28.125
in the first place, so...

37:35.234 --> 37:37.568
You might as well tell me
what's on your mind.

37:37.603 --> 37:39.670
I can hear you
staring at the wall

37:39.705 --> 37:41.839
from all the way over here.

37:41.874 --> 37:44.375
How do you handle it...

37:46.379 --> 37:49.113
Being away from Jennifer
for so long?

37:49.148 --> 37:53.484
Trust each other,
visit each other,

37:53.519 --> 37:57.955
and don't ask questions
you don't want answers to.

37:57.990 --> 37:59.790
That doesn't sound
like fun.

37:59.825 --> 38:01.825
Yeah, well, it shouldn't be
that hard for you.

38:01.861 --> 38:04.395
You're only here
for two years.

38:04.430 --> 38:06.864
I'm here for five more.

38:08.768 --> 38:12.102
- Jesus.
- You're telling me.

38:20.112 --> 38:24.782
You know, maybe I'll just
send Rachel a text...

38:24.817 --> 38:27.317
you know,
let her know that I'm okay.

38:27.353 --> 38:29.086
Sure thing, kid.

38:29.121 --> 38:32.423
Just give it back
when you're done.

38:32.458 --> 38:34.391
Well, now that
we're starting fresh,

38:34.427 --> 38:36.794
can we please finally get rid
of that hideous duck painting?

38:36.829 --> 38:39.496
- No, Louis, we can't.
- Why not?

38:39.532 --> 38:41.098
Because it's like you.

38:41.133 --> 38:43.300
I can't stand it,
but it's part of the family.

38:43.335 --> 38:45.536
Speaking of family,
where's Gretchen?

38:45.571 --> 38:47.971
I can't believe
she would walk out on us too.

38:48.007 --> 38:50.007
She didn't. We were supposed
to be at the wedding,

38:50.042 --> 38:51.875
so I gave her the day off
to go to the orthodontist.

38:51.911 --> 38:53.677
- Orthodontist?
- Yeah, the woman's in her 60s.

38:53.713 --> 38:55.779
She still wears
a retainer.

38:55.815 --> 38:57.314
All right,
we have a game plan.

38:57.349 --> 38:58.816
Tomorrow morning,
we offer them

38:58.851 --> 39:00.784
ten cents on the dollar
to settle these suits.

39:00.820 --> 39:02.152
And from this point on,

39:02.188 --> 39:05.422
we are all committing
to giving this firm

39:05.458 --> 39:09.626
every ounce of blood, sweat,
and tears we have.

39:12.131 --> 39:14.131
What is it?

39:14.166 --> 39:16.233
I just got a text
from Mike.

39:16.268 --> 39:17.935
What does it say?

39:17.970 --> 39:20.237
It says
that he's settling in

39:20.272 --> 39:23.140
and that he's getting along well
with his roommate...

39:25.778 --> 39:28.979
And that he thinks
he's gonna be okay.

39:29.014 --> 39:30.447
Maybe he's gonna be okay,

39:30.483 --> 39:34.251
but his roommate's
in for trouble.

39:34.286 --> 39:36.987
To trouble.

39:37.022 --> 39:38.522
To trouble.

39:43.996 --> 39:45.863
Hey.

39:47.867 --> 39:49.166
What?

39:49.201 --> 39:51.702
She texted you back.

39:53.339 --> 39:54.505
What did she say?

39:54.540 --> 39:57.274
She says she got your text,
she misses you,

39:57.309 --> 40:01.111
and she's glad you get along
with your roommate.

40:01.147 --> 40:03.380
Thanks, Frank...

40:03.415 --> 40:06.884
For everything.

40:08.888 --> 40:10.087
All right, let's go.

40:10.122 --> 40:12.156
Come on, you got to get out
before next shift.

40:12.191 --> 40:13.690
They can't know
I let you switch.

40:13.726 --> 40:15.859
Wait. Switch what?
I'm in the right cell.

40:15.895 --> 40:17.427
I'm in the one you gave me.

40:17.463 --> 40:20.030
Yeah, but this isn't
the one they gave me.

40:20.065 --> 40:21.098
What?

40:21.133 --> 40:23.167
You're in the right cell.
I'm not.

40:23.202 --> 40:24.602
What the hell are you
talking about?

40:24.637 --> 40:26.470
Only thing I told you
tonight that's true

40:26.505 --> 40:28.539
is that you shouldn't
trust people in here.

40:28.574 --> 40:30.374
But you did.
Now I know all about you.

40:30.409 --> 40:32.176
Why the hell would you
do that to me?

40:32.211 --> 40:34.178
You said you could've turned
on a guy to get out of here,

40:34.213 --> 40:36.547
but you didn't
because you owe him.

40:36.582 --> 40:38.682
Well, I owe that
son of a bitch too.

40:38.717 --> 40:39.883
Harvey.

40:39.919 --> 40:42.319
Yeah, Harvey Specter...

40:42.354 --> 40:43.587
put me away 13 years ago.

40:43.622 --> 40:46.390
I've been dreaming about
getting him back ever since.

40:46.425 --> 40:48.125
Then I read about you
in the paper,

40:48.160 --> 40:49.893
and I realized
I could get back at him

40:49.929 --> 40:51.328
without ever leaving
these walls.

40:51.363 --> 40:54.097
- You son of a bitch.
- Take it easy, Mike.

40:54.133 --> 40:55.666
You remember,
I know about you.

40:55.701 --> 40:57.367
And I got your
little girlfriend's number

40:57.403 --> 41:00.304
right here.
