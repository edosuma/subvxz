00:31.703 --> 00:35.156
<i>1942. The South Pacific.</i>

00:36.255 --> 00:41.043
<i>The New Year finds USS Enterprise
and her crew of 2,000 men</i>

00:41.143 --> 00:44.180
<i>preparing to deliver greetings
to the Japanese</i>

00:44.280 --> 00:48.485
<i>in the form of torpedo bombers
and fighter planes.</i>

00:48.585 --> 00:52.121
<i>With last month's attack
on Pearl Harbor still fresh in the minds</i>

00:52.221 --> 00:54.157
<i>of these American aviators,</i>

00:54.257 --> 00:59.936
<i>they've decided that revenge
is a dish best served piping hot.</i>

02:14.970 --> 02:19.045
Chief, this is Aldrich.
I'm losing her on the ARA.

02:23.663 --> 02:26.218
Come on, where are you goin'?

02:32.221 --> 02:35.108
Chief, I've lost the beacon. Over.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.885
Are we close, Chief?

02:38.261 --> 02:41.222
I'll give him a tap,
maybe his com is down.

02:42.598 --> 02:46.636
Chief, can you hear us? Over.

02:46.936 --> 02:49.362
Loud and clear, boys.

02:49.772 --> 02:53.231
Just waiting for this wind to tell me
which direction she wants to blow.

02:59.632 --> 03:02.645
Pastula, take another drift set.
That's not how I'm reading those wave tops.

03:02.745 --> 03:04.665
Yes, Chief.

03:08.291 --> 03:12.023
15 degrees.
Same read as the outbound, Chief.

03:18.267 --> 03:20.411
If that's correct...

03:20.511 --> 03:22.905
she's off to the east. I had her west.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.750
I'm taking her east.

03:44.544 --> 03:48.080
Blue Base, this is 6-tare-14
requesting an inbound bearing, Over.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.960
- Chief, you've broken radio silence.
- Affirmative. We need a bearing.

03:54.153 --> 03:56.589
Confirm you're on 79.

03:56.689 --> 03:59.358
7-niner confirmed.
I reckon we're still too far out.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.522
Well, keep trying.

04:04.096 --> 04:08.856
Blue Base 6-tare-14, do you read?
Come in, Blue Base, over.

04:14.784 --> 04:16.409
- Chief.
- Go.

04:16.509 --> 04:20.546
On the EMF, I heard Jap talk.
Pulled the plug.

04:20.646 --> 04:24.870
- Roger that. Let's go silent on Morse.
- Silent on Morse, affirmative.

04:27.453 --> 04:29.674
How are we on fuel, Chief?

04:31.156 --> 04:32.858
Low.

04:32.958 --> 04:35.928
Pastula, we need to make altitude.
Drop the ordinance.

04:36.028 --> 04:38.559
Aye-aye, Chief. Bombs away.

04:50.008 --> 04:53.278
- Aldrich, hit that MF.
- But the Japs, Chief.

04:53.378 --> 04:54.940
Do it!

04:56.248 --> 04:58.784
Blue Base, this is 6-tare-14,
do you read?

04:58.884 --> 05:02.188
6-tare-14 to Blue Base.
Come in, Blue Base. Over.

05:02.288 --> 05:04.480
Like hell she's east.

05:18.470 --> 05:21.971
Enterprise, this is 6-tare-14,
do you read?

05:22.071 --> 05:24.410
- Get on it, Aldrich.
- I'm on it.

05:24.510 --> 05:26.268
We're out of range.

05:54.540 --> 05:58.802
Boys, I got to put her down
before we run out of fuel.

05:59.311 --> 06:02.331
Snug up your vests, stand by
for a water landing, understood?

06:02.581 --> 06:03.783
You're kidding me.

06:03.883 --> 06:06.677
- Affirmative, Chief.
- Pastula?

06:07.586 --> 06:08.621
Yes, Chief?

06:08.721 --> 06:12.391
Aldrich, gather the flares,
the smoke candles and the first aid kit.

06:12.491 --> 06:14.360
We're gonna need the flashlight.

06:14.460 --> 06:17.683
Pastula, grab the rations and the water
and ready the life raft.

06:17.783 --> 06:20.118
Keep your heads, boys.

06:22.901 --> 06:24.534
Pass this back!

06:24.634 --> 06:27.190
- Got it.
- Coming through!

06:29.342 --> 06:30.976
Grab a parachute!

06:31.076 --> 06:33.837
- Parachute?
- Prepare to ditch!

06:44.823 --> 06:47.110
Brace for impact!

07:16.021 --> 07:17.623
- Pastula?
- Here, Chief.

07:17.723 --> 07:18.791
- Aldrich?
- Here.

07:18.891 --> 07:20.987
Step lively, boys.

07:44.249 --> 07:46.206
Come on!

07:48.487 --> 07:50.010
Chief!

07:57.829 --> 07:59.925
No, no!

08:28.594 --> 08:31.020
Damn thing won't inflate!

08:41.907 --> 08:45.173
The valve is jammed. Train that beam.

08:50.616 --> 08:53.910
Unship your weapons.
They're dragging us down.

08:58.257 --> 09:00.385
I can't get it.

09:03.095 --> 09:04.463
There goes mine.

09:04.563 --> 09:07.990
Mine too. That makes a difference.

09:13.572 --> 09:16.633
This damn thing.

09:19.111 --> 09:21.113
Here it goes!

09:22.394 --> 09:24.250
It's too heavy to lift.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.151
Maybe if we...

09:26.477 --> 09:28.271
Aldrich!

09:38.330 --> 09:41.400
You get trapped under there again,
just deflate the vest a little bit

09:41.500 --> 09:43.602
swim down and out, understood?

09:43.702 --> 09:45.642
I can't swim much.

09:45.742 --> 09:47.823
You're kidding. You?

09:47.923 --> 09:51.617
Not really, Chief. No!

09:53.679 --> 09:55.772
For crying out...

10:04.623 --> 10:06.292
Okay.

10:06.892 --> 10:10.021
This is gonna be hard to turn over
in these swells.

10:13.365 --> 10:16.582
We take off our vests,
string them together,

10:16.682 --> 10:19.883
tie one on here and throw the other across.
Then we go around and pull.

10:19.983 --> 10:22.174
- Good idea.
- Except neither one of you can swim.

10:22.274 --> 10:26.345
Just have to hold tight
to the handrail, real tight.

10:27.145 --> 10:29.068
- Okay. Let's give it a go.
- Yeah.

10:33.384 --> 10:34.477
Here.

10:40.359 --> 10:44.324
All right. Okay.
Go around, then I'll toss it over.

10:51.904 --> 10:54.096
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.703
Here it comes!

10:57.125 --> 10:59.919
- You got it?
- All right. We got it.

11:03.782 --> 11:07.553
All right, get a grip
and heave like you mean it.

11:07.653 --> 11:10.816
One, two, three!

11:15.427 --> 11:17.250
Come on.

11:24.335 --> 11:28.427
Hold it down. I'll go around
the other side and climb in.

11:39.050 --> 11:40.880
Come on.

11:48.427 --> 11:51.644
Kippers in a can got more space.

11:52.097 --> 11:54.770
Let's try laying athwart.

12:14.653 --> 12:17.923
Aldrich, I think you already
strapped in when I was on deck.

12:18.023 --> 12:21.130
Didn't get a good look at you.
Harold Dixon.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.295
Gene Aldrich.

12:23.395 --> 12:26.898
You'll get a gander in the morning,
Chief. I'm sure I'll be here.

12:26.998 --> 12:29.335
Pastula, is that Italian?

12:29.435 --> 12:31.270
- Polish, Chief.
- Polish.

12:31.370 --> 12:33.205
I've made a couple of hops
with you before.

12:33.305 --> 12:36.737
Oh, yeah? I don't remember.

12:39.845 --> 12:42.331
We'll be picked up come morning,
you reckon, Chief?

12:42.810 --> 12:44.783
That's what I'm hoping.

12:44.883 --> 12:47.853
- Hoping?
- We got procedures for this.

12:47.953 --> 12:51.409
Come early morning,
they'll be on us like an old hound dog.

12:59.965 --> 13:02.657
It was so damn hot inside that plane.

13:03.435 --> 13:05.793
It's freezing down here.

13:31.530 --> 13:33.888
Cock-a-doodle-doo, boys.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.641
Well, we made it.

13:42.841 --> 13:45.911
I was worried she wouldn't keep us
afloat, but she's still ship-shape.

13:46.411 --> 13:48.439
Thank God.

13:50.215 --> 13:54.720
Gene Aldrich, now I know you.
I couldn't put a face in the name.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.836
In all my glory, Chief.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.291
All right, who's up
for a fresh cup of coffee?

13:59.741 --> 14:03.175
Hen-Ry! I'm gonna put on the pot.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.423
All right, yeah.

14:08.366 --> 14:11.690
- Thanks, Henry.
- Henry? Why Henry?

14:11.790 --> 14:14.884
Oh, it's that show, you know,
off the radio?

14:17.128 --> 14:20.953
Hen-Ry! Henry Aldrich!

14:22.734 --> 14:24.857
No, I never heard of it.

14:29.941 --> 14:34.112
Chief, when you said you were gonna land
in the drink, I thought, boy, this is it.

14:34.412 --> 14:37.849
- Thought I couldn't land her?
- Wasn't that some flying?

14:37.949 --> 14:41.086
I mean, he just laid her right down.

14:41.486 --> 14:43.683
Yeah, he sure did.

14:46.158 --> 14:49.427
You know, Aldrich, I've been wondering,

14:49.527 --> 14:52.098
I don't understand
how you couldn't raise that carrier.

14:52.198 --> 14:55.033
We couldn't have been more
than 20 miles out at one point.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.637
Even at 40,
should have caught something, right?

14:59.756 --> 15:02.733
You tell me, Chief. How far out were we?

15:09.781 --> 15:12.803
We should keep our eyes peeled, right?

15:15.487 --> 15:19.751
That's right. Everybody take a point.
We need to cover 360.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.135
Good visibility.

15:30.235 --> 15:33.272
Yeah, they'll check
every square mile out here.

15:33.772 --> 15:36.375
It'll take a while,
but they'll do it, won't they?

15:36.475 --> 15:40.045
Right, even if it takes all day
or into tomorrow.

15:40.145 --> 15:43.621
Yep. Could take most of a day.

15:43.982 --> 15:47.753
They'll do a box out to 50.
Well, even 100. They got the vis.

15:47.853 --> 15:52.791
Divide that by the number of planes,
heck, it's likely to be this morning.

15:53.311 --> 15:56.015
Maybe we'll get a real breakfast, Chief?

16:13.779 --> 16:17.438
You figure we'll see 'em first
or hear 'em?

16:22.921 --> 16:25.249
You see that speck?

16:26.925 --> 16:28.972
That's a bird.

16:29.244 --> 16:31.753
It ain't moving its wings.

16:37.235 --> 16:38.992
Wait.

16:40.756 --> 16:44.621
That's something all right.
Steady on our course, whatever...

16:47.212 --> 16:49.081
That's one of ours.

16:49.181 --> 16:51.116
- Hey! Hey!
- Get down!

16:51.416 --> 16:55.253
Low down!
You got plenty of time to drown.

16:55.353 --> 16:58.490
- That thing is an SPD.
- She's on a bearing.

16:58.590 --> 17:01.626
About 140 knots, half a mile out.

17:02.694 --> 17:05.097
Pastula, grab the parachute,
spread it on the water.

17:05.652 --> 17:09.200
- Chief?
- No parachute.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.637
- Aldrich, how about those flares?
- I couldn't hold them, Chief.

17:12.738 --> 17:15.224
Well, wave something!

17:19.176 --> 17:22.614
Look down here! What, are you blind?

17:22.714 --> 17:25.684
Sun's behind you. Check your 3:00.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.720
Down here!

17:33.020 --> 17:35.928
- Over here!
- Down here!

17:43.298 --> 17:44.991
Look here.

17:45.470 --> 17:48.774
Come on. Where... where you going?

17:48.874 --> 17:50.409
No, no, no, where...

17:55.180 --> 17:56.743
We're over here!

18:03.755 --> 18:04.990
Come on.

18:13.858 --> 18:15.667
Over here.

18:39.124 --> 18:42.034
That was our one and only chance.

18:42.794 --> 18:45.597
- What?
- That was our search.

18:46.197 --> 18:50.305
What do you mean?
They can't just leave us here.

18:50.801 --> 18:52.704
Could be he saw us
and he's going back for help.

18:52.804 --> 18:54.730
Why didn't he break course?

18:54.830 --> 18:58.410
'Cause he's on a box search is why.
Next pass, he'll be out of sight.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.146
Well...

19:01.246 --> 19:04.883
well, maybe there'll be more planes
double-checking or ships?

19:04.983 --> 19:08.401
What the hell are they telling you
in boot camp?

19:08.501 --> 19:10.922
We are at war, Aldrich.

19:11.022 --> 19:14.226
We're in the vicinity
of enemy naval forces.

19:14.326 --> 19:17.306
We get one quick look, at best.

19:17.662 --> 19:20.224
Like you said, there's a procedure.

19:26.571 --> 19:28.376
All right.

19:29.174 --> 19:32.210
No parachute or flares.

19:32.584 --> 19:34.462
I don't suppose
the chart board made it either?

19:34.562 --> 19:35.730
Affirmative.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.975
- First aid kit?
- Everything's gone, Chief.

19:41.252 --> 19:43.744
Including the rations and water.

19:43.844 --> 19:45.849
Oh, God.

19:46.358 --> 19:47.869
I don't get it,

19:47.969 --> 19:50.952
I give the orders in plenty of time
so I could get busy with the landing,

19:51.052 --> 19:55.117
- and we have no food and no water?
- We were pretty busy not drowning.

19:57.535 --> 20:00.066
How are we gonna survive
out here with no water?

20:16.288 --> 20:18.890
Okay. Coming aft.

20:18.990 --> 20:21.049
Listen up, lads.

20:24.295 --> 20:27.999
This raft is a vessel of the United States
Navy, and I am her captain.

20:28.099 --> 20:31.853
As such, I will be giving the orders
and you will be taking them. Are we clear?

20:31.953 --> 20:34.649
- Aye-aye, Chief.
- Aldrich?

20:35.473 --> 20:37.309
Crystal, Chief.

20:37.409 --> 20:40.112
All right. Let's take an inventory.

20:40.212 --> 20:43.941
Pockets, everything,
pile it on the shirt.

20:45.216 --> 20:47.012
Got two magazines.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.055
I got my pocket knife.

20:50.155 --> 20:54.093
Keep that in your pocket. The last thing
we need is a hole in this raft.

20:54.993 --> 20:58.229
Pair of pliers, bit of wire,

20:58.329 --> 21:01.199
some cord, maybe about 20 feet.

21:01.299 --> 21:03.263
Here's a whistle.

21:04.636 --> 21:06.071
Aldrich.

21:06.985 --> 21:08.740
Rubber cement fluid.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.243
- Any patching material in there?
- Yeah.

21:13.143 --> 21:15.003
Look at this.

21:16.081 --> 21:18.683
We can use if we see another plane.

21:18.783 --> 21:21.386
Wish we'd have found that earlier.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.565
A water bag.

21:26.958 --> 21:28.744
It's empty.

21:32.630 --> 21:34.132
That's all she's got, Chief.

21:34.232 --> 21:36.434
Little fold-up oars
under that thwart, Aldrich?

21:36.534 --> 21:39.910
Negative.
Don't forget about the handrail.

21:40.010 --> 21:45.261
- It's about 25 feet of nylon.
- Yeah. And we got these two life vests.

21:49.881 --> 21:52.817
No oars, no flashlights...

21:52.917 --> 21:56.746
no map, no food, no water.

21:57.589 --> 21:59.278
Chronometers?

22:00.024 --> 22:01.463
Negative.

22:01.563 --> 22:04.592
- No.
- No.

22:06.631 --> 22:10.291
But if she stays afloat, at least
I can figure her speed and distance.

22:14.305 --> 22:17.727
She looks practically new. That's good.

22:18.142 --> 22:22.847
Oh, here... "manufactured, 11/30/37."

22:23.147 --> 22:25.118
It's four years old.

22:25.218 --> 22:26.740
Plus some.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.654
Boys, we should minimize
the wear on the fabric.

22:29.754 --> 22:31.409
Shoes.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.495
There's not much room.

22:37.595 --> 22:41.526
On or off, they're liable to scuff.
I say we deep-six 'em.

23:05.256 --> 23:07.940
They say it's five miles deep out here.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.101
That's impossible.

23:13.965 --> 23:15.651
Chief?

23:15.900 --> 23:19.757
I'm thinking... maybe one
of us should keep them.

23:20.772 --> 23:24.227
If we make land,
somebody's gonna need to walk.

23:29.547 --> 23:31.302
Makes sense.

23:36.688 --> 23:38.923
Hey, I still got this.

23:39.723 --> 23:42.894
Pastula, for a boy who can't swim,
you were a fool to keep it.

23:43.394 --> 23:46.052
Well, couldn't get the rawhide loose.

23:47.065 --> 23:51.396
But you never know, might come in handy.

24:04.082 --> 24:07.185
Youngstown, Ohio. You?

24:07.285 --> 24:08.987
Sikeston, Missouri.

24:09.087 --> 24:12.357
Sikeston, where is that?

24:12.457 --> 24:14.248
Nowhere.

24:24.902 --> 24:26.440
Pastula...

24:26.540 --> 24:29.541
take another drift set. That's not
how I'm reading those wave tops.

24:29.641 --> 24:31.632
Yes, Chief.

24:32.177 --> 24:35.869
15 degrees.
Same read as the outbound, Chief.

24:44.188 --> 24:47.652
If that's correct, then she's east.
I had her west.

24:48.526 --> 24:51.563
- Aldrich?
- Not a peep on the Hayrake.

24:51.663 --> 24:55.099
I reckon you've flown us to the middle
of nowhere, Chief. We're lost.

24:55.199 --> 24:57.429
Say again, Aldrich?

24:58.402 --> 25:00.125
Aldrich!

25:03.307 --> 25:05.810
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

25:05.910 --> 25:09.380
How was it possible that you have
never had a Kentucky hot brown?

25:09.480 --> 25:10.482
I'm from Ohio.

25:10.582 --> 25:13.885
So you're not allowed to eat food
from neighboring states?

25:14.585 --> 25:15.587
No.

25:16.386 --> 25:18.716
Glad I don't live in Ohio.

25:33.204 --> 25:35.156
Ham and cheese.

25:35.606 --> 25:37.742
Now you're talking.

25:37.942 --> 25:41.079
I must have made a thousand of those
in the Civilian Conservation Corps.

25:41.179 --> 25:44.550
The Cs? Me too. I cooked for 100 fellas.

25:44.650 --> 25:47.218
Two cooks and no food.

25:47.318 --> 25:50.087
So how'd you do end up Navy?

25:50.187 --> 25:53.825
Well, a few too many mouths
to feed at home.

25:53.925 --> 25:56.232
My mother thought
I could become more disciplined.

25:56.332 --> 25:58.796
Imagine her disappointment.

25:58.896 --> 26:02.733
And I was ready for an adventure.
So I enlist.

26:02.833 --> 26:05.136
Well, you sure got an adventure.

26:05.236 --> 26:07.595
If mother could see me now.

26:10.141 --> 26:13.044
I want to make it a career
and see the world.

26:13.144 --> 26:15.847
Career Navy, good for you, son.

26:16.347 --> 26:19.945
In these troubled times,
there is no higher calling.

26:24.288 --> 26:27.558
Do you think it's possible
we'll get seen at night, Chief?

26:27.658 --> 26:32.515
Wouldn't rule it out.
This yellow raft, moonlight might...

26:32.864 --> 26:36.401
Well, no full moon tonight.

26:36.701 --> 26:39.237
We'll schedule a watch, anyway,
four on, eight off.

26:39.337 --> 26:41.839
- Who wants first up?
- I'll take it.

26:41.939 --> 26:43.875
I can't sleep anyhow.

26:43.975 --> 26:48.013
All right. I'll take
second watch, Pastula.

26:48.713 --> 26:50.741
Okay, Chief.

27:19.310 --> 27:21.145
Told me to rouse you up.

27:21.245 --> 27:23.773
Reckon it's been about four hours.

27:25.616 --> 27:28.507
- You see anything?
- Just ocean.

27:39.363 --> 27:41.614
You had anything to drink yet, Aldrich?

27:41.714 --> 27:43.822
Drink what?

27:56.481 --> 27:59.075
Oh, you got to be kidding me, Chief.

28:32.683 --> 28:35.109
That's just wonderful.

28:59.644 --> 29:02.798
- Watch?
- Nothing.

29:03.514 --> 29:05.878
Pretty steady breeze, though.

29:08.786 --> 29:12.618
Hen-Ry! I'm gonna put on the pot.

29:16.427 --> 29:18.398
How long has the breeze been up?

29:18.498 --> 29:20.935
- An hour, maybe.
- Same direction?

29:25.569 --> 29:28.256
- Chief?
- Pastula.

29:29.306 --> 29:31.399
Where are we?

29:35.646 --> 29:38.349
1,900 miles to Hawaii.

29:38.449 --> 29:40.818
Samoa's 1,000.

29:41.318 --> 29:44.856
- South America, 6,000 at least.
- That's a lot of zeros.

29:44.956 --> 29:49.260
But we are moving. Flat-bottom craft
like this will sail along smartly,

29:49.360 --> 29:51.888
and we've been getting
some 12-knot winds.

29:59.604 --> 30:02.777
Six-knot wind will give us
a drift of one.

30:03.407 --> 30:06.663
I bet we can get a 2.5 out of 12.

30:08.212 --> 30:10.247
She sure does like
to change her mind, though.

30:10.647 --> 30:12.984
- So Hawaii?
- Yep.

30:13.833 --> 30:15.658
How come you didn't point that way?

30:16.058 --> 30:18.089
- Dead ahead?
- West?

30:18.189 --> 30:21.211
That's right, the way
the wind's blowing us now.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.697
The Phoenix Islands, the Gilberts,

30:25.797 --> 30:28.249
Tarawa, 600 miles or less.

30:28.349 --> 30:32.115
- Tarawa? Ain't there Jap subs out there?
- Great.

30:32.215 --> 30:35.473
Not just subs. Jap army is crawling
all over those islands right now.

30:35.573 --> 30:39.643
What happens if we land on a Jap island
or a sub finds us?

30:39.743 --> 30:42.380
For all we know, there could be
a sub underneath us right now.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.749
We would certainly be a prize.

30:46.417 --> 30:51.222
But we have a chance. All we need is
some favorable winds to blow us south.

30:51.322 --> 30:55.159
There are islands between us
and Samoa 600 miles away.

30:55.259 --> 30:57.444
Two knots or so,

30:57.544 --> 30:59.997
- I'd say a couple of weeks, give or take.
- Couple of weeks?

31:00.097 --> 31:04.295
- Be lot more accurate if I had my chart.
- We'll starve to death first.

31:07.939 --> 31:09.362
Well...

31:10.062 --> 31:12.454
plenty of fish in the sea, right?

31:12.554 --> 31:14.831
If only I had a hook and a line.

31:16.714 --> 31:19.517
All right, Aldrich, there's your line.

31:19.817 --> 31:22.311
Some braided cord in that pocket.

31:27.425 --> 31:30.328
And here. Maybe if I can get
one of these magazines open,

31:30.428 --> 31:32.530
we can use one of the springs as a hook.

31:32.630 --> 31:35.794
- That could work just fine.
- All right.

31:38.903 --> 31:41.312
You know what I could go for right now?

31:41.672 --> 31:45.009
Fish fry, nice deep fried basket of cod,

31:45.109 --> 31:49.046
side of slaw and some potato salad,
whole thing smothered in cheese.

31:49.446 --> 31:51.762
Really? Cheese on fish?

31:51.862 --> 31:56.238
Hey, there ain't nothing that can't
be improved with a good slab of cheese.

31:57.655 --> 31:59.444
There we go.

32:07.598 --> 32:09.387
All right.

32:15.006 --> 32:17.207
That ain't half bad.

32:17.307 --> 32:19.403
We need a sinker.

32:36.260 --> 32:38.803
Kind of looks like a piece of meat.

32:42.299 --> 32:45.590
- Well, let's cast 'er off.
- All right.

32:47.171 --> 32:49.731
Watch your eyes. There she goes.

33:05.589 --> 33:08.254
That was quick.
Give me a hand with this.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.393
- All right.
- Come here.

33:09.493 --> 33:11.314
That's the way, boys.

33:16.801 --> 33:19.503
I guess something down there
is hungrier than us.

33:19.603 --> 33:21.326
Sweet Mary.

34:02.847 --> 34:06.303
Here, put this on your head.

34:10.721 --> 34:12.530
Suit yourself.

34:20.097 --> 34:23.134
- Hey.
- What is it?

34:23.918 --> 34:25.889
It's nothing.

34:26.437 --> 34:29.572
For a second there, I thought
we might be in line for a medal,

34:29.672 --> 34:32.167
Navy Cross or something.

34:32.610 --> 34:35.112
Then I realized there's not much heroic
about sitting in a raft

34:35.212 --> 34:36.746
and starving to death.

34:36.847 --> 34:39.210
Navy Cross.

34:39.717 --> 34:42.553
We'll be lucky we don't get charged
the cost of a new plane.

34:42.652 --> 34:46.376
Heck. Wasn't anybody's fault, right?

34:47.525 --> 34:51.822
Perfectly good torpedo bomber
lying on the bottom of the ocean.

34:52.329 --> 34:54.385
Sounds like it's gotta be
somebody's fault.

35:01.105 --> 35:03.661
Damn fish aren't biting.

35:06.923 --> 35:09.373
- Where are you going?
- There ain't no fish.

35:09.473 --> 35:12.070
Which means there ain't no food.

35:14.518 --> 35:16.777
I can't take the heat no more.

35:23.994 --> 35:26.630
Come on in, boys! The water's fine!

35:26.730 --> 35:30.234
- No, no, one at a time.
- That's 2,000 to Hawaii, you said?

35:30.334 --> 35:33.470
Don't get too far!
This boat's moving, you know!

35:33.570 --> 35:35.973
Hey, we got some real live bait
out there now, Chief?

35:36.073 --> 35:39.109
- That's another problem.
- Sharks?

35:39.209 --> 35:42.980
I don't know if they'd attack.
I've heard arguments both ways.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.972
Gene! Chief's wondering about sharks!

35:49.620 --> 35:52.109
Oh, jeez, where you going?

36:04.635 --> 36:06.827
Just a few more strokes, Aldrich.

36:19.750 --> 36:21.632
We need to stay with the raft.

36:21.732 --> 36:24.789
I think if we hang on to the sides
we'll be safe. The others can stand guard.

36:24.889 --> 36:28.259
That did get the blood pumping, though.

36:28.359 --> 36:30.782
Pastula, you're next.

36:33.330 --> 36:35.289
No, thanks.

36:37.067 --> 36:39.266
See, that's why you got to do it last

36:39.366 --> 36:41.970
'cause if you broil it for too long,
it's gonna burn for sure,

36:42.070 --> 36:45.196
and if you go too short,
it's not gonna broil evenly.

36:50.981 --> 36:53.111
It's beautiful, isn't it?

36:53.851 --> 36:56.072
Be better if we could eat it.

37:03.394 --> 37:06.664
I was doing all right, see.
I didn't expect no, "A."

37:06.764 --> 37:10.534
- Was this the mechanic's course?
- No, it was another one.

37:10.634 --> 37:13.504
I thought I ought to get a "B"
or anyways a "C"

37:13.604 --> 37:15.272
and that would have been all right.

37:15.372 --> 37:20.110
I never really cared about making the best
marks in school as long I learned the stuff.

37:20.893 --> 37:23.848
And I had this course down good.

37:24.148 --> 37:27.551
I saw that report card,
and saw that big shiny "F."

37:27.951 --> 37:32.289
I just said to hell with this bullcrap,
excuse my language.

37:32.389 --> 37:33.757
So what'd you do?

37:33.857 --> 37:37.194
I just walked out of school
and never went back.

37:37.294 --> 37:39.597
And you had that course
down good, you reckon.

37:39.697 --> 37:41.788
You bet I did.

37:43.300 --> 37:46.537
But I'm assuming you aced
that mechanic's course.

37:46.837 --> 37:48.839
I did well enough, Chief.

37:48.939 --> 37:51.258
So you could dismantle
and reassemble a drift sight,

37:51.358 --> 37:53.927
much less take a reading on one.

37:54.253 --> 37:57.508
- Yeah. I guess I could.
- Yeah?

37:58.148 --> 38:00.150
Just strange, that's all.

38:00.250 --> 38:03.087
I had us headed west.
Your sighting corrected us east.

38:03.187 --> 38:05.322
You asked for confirmation
and he gave it to you...

38:05.422 --> 38:08.517
I'm discussing this
with my bombardier, Aldrich.

38:12.629 --> 38:16.522
I know you confirmed it.
I'm just saying it's strange, that's all.

38:19.803 --> 38:21.967
Okay, Chief.

38:25.910 --> 38:28.274
It's strange all right.

38:57.141 --> 38:59.242
Hen-Ry!

38:59.342 --> 39:00.804
Put on the pot.

39:38.649 --> 39:40.765
Pastula.

39:41.418 --> 39:43.523
Ain't there a rule?

39:43.887 --> 39:46.923
A guy can have a handful
and still be okay?

39:47.448 --> 39:50.417
Sucks the water right out
of your brains, they say.

39:53.096 --> 39:55.861
Coming up on 120 hours.

39:57.201 --> 39:59.727
Five days, not a sip.

40:02.105 --> 40:04.041
How come we ain't dead?

40:04.141 --> 40:07.111
We've been soakin' ourselves...

40:07.211 --> 40:08.545
not moving around too much.

40:08.645 --> 40:13.006
Couple shoes full of the yellow stuff.
While it lasted.

40:19.022 --> 40:20.608
Not even a rudder.

40:20.708 --> 40:23.527
But you know where you want us
to go, right, Chief?

40:24.027 --> 40:26.707
I know. But to calculate...

40:29.549 --> 40:30.651
Chief?

40:35.973 --> 40:38.175
- A pencil.
- Pencil?

40:38.275 --> 40:40.654
Gol'-darn ever-loving pencil.

40:40.754 --> 40:43.567
You see it? I can make a chart!

41:01.131 --> 41:05.962
Pastula, you said east two to
three knots on your watch, yeah?

41:06.603 --> 41:10.424
Aldrich? More like southeast
two to three?

41:10.524 --> 41:12.381
Yeah, affirmative.

41:15.446 --> 41:17.514
Okay, then.

41:17.614 --> 41:20.584
Here we are, by dead reckoning.

41:20.684 --> 41:22.853
Then where are we headed?

41:22.953 --> 41:25.422
With luck, right here.

41:25.522 --> 41:28.608
Those islands I told you about,
there's a chain of 'em to our southwest.

41:28.708 --> 41:31.278
Closest friendly land in the Pacific.

41:32.028 --> 41:34.631
Now if this favorable wind
will just push us there.

41:35.731 --> 41:38.635
What if it just keeps shifting, Chief?

41:38.735 --> 41:41.671
The chart don't take us nowhere.

41:41.771 --> 41:43.567
Unless...

41:47.544 --> 41:50.534
Unless we can hold our position
in the headwind.

41:51.982 --> 41:54.906
Aldrich, untie the handrail.

41:55.219 --> 41:58.355
Pastula, I need you
to take some of that wire,

41:58.455 --> 42:03.393
and you make a frame to keep this
from folding up in the water.

42:03.493 --> 42:05.756
- Can you do it?
- You bet, Chief.

42:12.286 --> 42:14.873
Aldrich, leave one end tied.

42:45.902 --> 42:48.298
Here, hold him up. Hold him up.

43:01.418 --> 43:02.786
Perfect!

43:03.086 --> 43:07.273
That, sailors, is a sea anchor.

43:07.373 --> 43:11.578
We might not be able to control the wind,
but we can avoid being blown the wrong way.

43:12.011 --> 43:14.130
That's nice work, Chief.

43:14.230 --> 43:18.235
Now, I'll be yelling,
"Hen-Ry, put on the brake!"

43:18.874 --> 43:21.498
Look at her grab that water.

43:24.541 --> 43:26.060
Hey, Tony, look.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.578
I'll be damned if I don't see
a tear of joy in old Chief.

43:28.678 --> 43:30.581
And he said
we were too dried up for that.

43:30.681 --> 43:34.636
- I do believe you're right.
- Really, you saw a tear?

43:44.694 --> 43:47.523
Okay. Let off the brake.

44:09.653 --> 44:11.121
Men, it isn't easy.

44:12.171 --> 44:14.191
But it might be worse.

44:14.291 --> 44:18.628
If we can keep this wind
and just get a little rain.

44:19.186 --> 44:20.806
Well...

44:22.517 --> 44:24.772
it never hurt to ask.

44:29.706 --> 44:31.274
Dear Lord.

44:31.374 --> 44:34.111
Gene, the only prayers
I know are in Polish.

44:34.211 --> 44:37.347
I hadn't marked you
for a churchgoing man, Aldrich.

44:37.447 --> 44:39.809
I'm sorry to say I'm not much of one.

44:43.386 --> 44:45.222
That's all right.

44:45.322 --> 44:47.481
Just follow my lead.

44:50.527 --> 44:52.406
Dear Lord...

44:52.706 --> 44:55.765
we know we ain't always
done right by you,

44:56.185 --> 45:00.328
we're asking for a little help here
during this trial,

45:00.428 --> 45:02.626
if it so pleases you.

45:10.247 --> 45:12.202
And, Lord...

45:14.050 --> 45:18.355
watch over all the men back on our ship

45:18.455 --> 45:22.617
and all the ships at sea...
including this one.

45:26.496 --> 45:28.183
Tony?

45:34.004 --> 45:35.739
Dear God,

45:36.039 --> 45:39.828
I'll go along
with what the other guys said.

45:40.544 --> 45:42.755
But mostly...

45:42.855 --> 45:45.318
we need some rain, Lord.

45:46.349 --> 45:48.351
- Please.
- Rain, dear Lord.

45:48.451 --> 45:50.454
- Please rain.
- Please.

45:50.554 --> 45:52.279
Amen.

45:57.761 --> 45:59.596
Oh, come on!

45:59.696 --> 46:03.355
Jeez, give him a second.
He's got to cook it up.

46:04.034 --> 46:05.974
Or maybe...

46:07.370 --> 46:10.663
<i>It ain't gonna rain no more</i>

46:16.112 --> 46:19.850
<i>Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more, no more</i>

46:19.950 --> 46:22.853
<i>It ain't gonna rain no more</i>

46:22.953 --> 46:25.722
<i>How in the hell can the old folks sail</i>

46:25.822 --> 46:28.909
<i>It ain't gonna rain no more</i>

46:30.627 --> 46:34.331
<i>Old Uncle Ned laid by the sewer</i>

46:34.431 --> 46:37.167
<i>By that sewer he died</i>

46:37.267 --> 46:39.803
<i>All the neighbors up and said</i>

46:39.903 --> 46:42.961
<i>It must have been sewer-side</i>

46:44.541 --> 46:46.469
That's a good one.

46:49.045 --> 46:51.641
Hey, Chief, you got one?

46:57.354 --> 47:00.073
<i>Oh, it isn't going to rain anymore,
anymore</i>

47:00.173 --> 47:02.426
<i>It isn't going to rain anymore</i>

47:02.526 --> 47:07.497
<i>The grammar's good, but what a bore,
so we'll sing it like before</i>

47:08.570 --> 47:09.733
Big finish!

47:09.833 --> 47:13.370
<i>Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more, no more</i>

47:13.470 --> 47:15.956
<i>It ain't gonna rain no more</i>

47:16.056 --> 47:19.293
<i>Our song is done, but it sure was fun</i>

47:19.543 --> 47:23.906
<i>Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more</i>

48:20.570 --> 48:22.556
What's wrong?

48:23.039 --> 48:26.136
Nothing. Nothing.

48:44.761 --> 48:48.431
Battle stations, boys!
We've got precipitation!

48:48.531 --> 48:50.400
I got the bag.

48:50.500 --> 48:54.262
- Here it comes!
- Get as much as you can!

48:59.509 --> 49:01.767
Fill 'er up! Fill 'er up!

49:24.300 --> 49:26.370
Looks like your prayers worked, Aldrich!

49:26.470 --> 49:30.525
You're gonna have to thank Sunday School
at First Baptist Church, Chief!

50:05.475 --> 50:07.344
Come on, you stupid fish.

50:07.444 --> 50:10.505
Haven't you ever seen
a fishing line before?

50:11.948 --> 50:14.071
A week of nothing.

50:15.552 --> 50:19.790
By golly, Aldrich, you are the most
patient fisherman I've ever seen.

50:20.190 --> 50:24.513
Where I come from,
don't catch, don't eat.

50:27.063 --> 50:29.594
Just going about this
the wrong way, that's all.

50:32.602 --> 50:35.394
Keep that knife in your pocket,
like I told you.

50:37.777 --> 50:39.109
If you put a hole in this raft...

50:39.209 --> 50:42.746
We don't eat soon,
we might just as well, Chief.

50:42.846 --> 50:46.917
Aldrich, you store that knife!
That's an order.

50:47.217 --> 50:50.240
If you don't catch, you don't eat.

50:52.889 --> 50:54.591
Aldrich...

50:54.791 --> 50:57.356
- I hit one.
- Stop it!

50:59.098 --> 51:02.441
- I hit the raft. I hit the raft.
- God, you idiot.

51:02.541 --> 51:05.301
Don't move! I'll get the cement.

51:05.401 --> 51:08.326
It ain't the raft! Oh, shit!

51:10.473 --> 51:12.094
Don't let it go!

51:23.303 --> 51:26.294
I think I got it. I think I got it.

51:32.095 --> 51:34.764
- Nice work, Pastula.
- Atta boy, Tony.

51:35.191 --> 51:37.867
Fell... fell out of the sky.

51:38.879 --> 51:41.524
A shark just fell out of the sky.

51:51.281 --> 51:52.574
Oh, jeez.

51:59.989 --> 52:02.354
Looks like she just had dinner.

52:27.817 --> 52:30.007
We got bait for another day or two.

52:31.554 --> 52:34.458
Probably some for an extra meal as well.

52:34.958 --> 52:36.593
The salt will keep it.

52:36.693 --> 52:38.728
How far we got to those islands, Chief?

52:38.828 --> 52:42.299
According to the chart, roughly 390.

52:42.699 --> 52:45.668
Wind's out of the northeast,
which is just right for us.

52:45.768 --> 52:49.339
If she switches on us, we just throw
on the brake, no backsliding.

52:50.465 --> 52:54.256
- We're goin' home.
- And, boy, will my wife be sore.

52:54.356 --> 52:57.405
Here I thought
you was only married to the Navy.

53:01.484 --> 53:04.354
- Neither of you boys are married?
- Nope.

53:04.454 --> 53:07.190
I got a girl back in Youngstown.

53:07.590 --> 53:12.095
- Irene.
- Not me. But I'd like to someday.

53:12.195 --> 53:14.134
Hey, I got a sister.

53:14.234 --> 53:16.690
- You two would get along.
- No kidding?

53:16.790 --> 53:18.415
What's she like?

53:18.515 --> 53:21.955
I don't know. People say she's like me.

53:22.055 --> 53:24.807
That's not much
of an advertisement, Pastula.

53:24.907 --> 53:26.877
She don't look like me.

53:27.377 --> 53:32.273
She's, you know, easy to get along with
and a lot prettier than me.

53:33.550 --> 53:35.752
- Describe her to me.
- Really?

53:36.884 --> 53:38.822
Yeah, really.

53:38.922 --> 53:42.926
Well, she's about 5'4.

53:43.026 --> 53:46.395
<i>She's got long brown hair...</i>

53:46.495 --> 53:48.588
<i>green eyes.</i>

53:49.832 --> 53:53.224
- <i>This is kind of weird, Gene.</i>
- <i>Keep going.</i>

53:54.370 --> 53:57.040
<i>She's a whiz in the kitchen.</i>

53:57.140 --> 53:59.019
<i>She likes to read.</i>

53:59.119 --> 54:01.401
<i>She wears... clothes.</i>

54:03.112 --> 54:05.982
She wears clothes?
Well, I should certainly hope so.

54:06.082 --> 54:07.952
Clothes are not a requirement
in my book.

54:08.052 --> 54:10.603
Hey, that's my sister
you're talking about.

54:10.853 --> 54:14.441
And when we get through this, I'll thank you
to set me up with her. She sounds lovely.

54:24.534 --> 54:26.569
We got company.

54:27.703 --> 54:31.858
Must be all the blood in the water.
I've heard they can smell it for miles.

54:33.076 --> 54:35.176
What do we do?

54:35.276 --> 54:37.546
Well, for starters...

54:37.646 --> 54:40.405
I say we cancel the swimming program.

55:34.370 --> 55:37.264
- What's the matter?
- I got bit!

55:39.175 --> 55:41.640
Cease fire! Cease fire!

55:43.112 --> 55:45.081
Let me see. Let me see.

55:45.181 --> 55:46.988
Oh, Ge...

55:47.088 --> 55:50.667
It's three teeth marks at least.
One nail's ripped off.

55:50.767 --> 55:52.536
Oh, Gene.

55:52.922 --> 55:54.742
Here, Chief.

55:57.360 --> 56:00.557
Well, I've heard of fishing by hand,
but that's ridiculous.

56:01.013 --> 56:02.098
Is it bad?

56:02.198 --> 56:04.062
We'll get a better look
at it in the morning.

56:07.120 --> 56:09.506
- Keep pressure on it.
- Okay.

56:27.139 --> 56:29.533
What do they call us, Chief?

56:30.127 --> 56:31.831
What?

56:32.762 --> 56:36.587
Missing in action or... what?

56:40.136 --> 56:42.271
Lost at sea.

56:42.371 --> 56:44.758
That's how they carried us.

56:46.041 --> 56:48.144
Lost at sea.

56:48.244 --> 56:51.542
No trace of aircraft
or personnel is found.

58:28.677 --> 58:31.681
Our Father, who art in heaven...

58:31.781 --> 58:33.983
hallowed be Thy name.

58:34.083 --> 58:37.777
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done on Earth...

58:47.830 --> 58:50.355
The two bright stars there?

01:00:27.529 --> 01:00:29.485
Tony?

01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:30.950
Give me the gun.

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:34.488
Give it to me.

01:00:38.207 --> 01:00:40.435
Gene, I wasn't...

01:00:41.444 --> 01:00:43.608
Wanna eat or not?

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:03.399
I got him! I got him!

01:01:03.499 --> 01:01:06.027
- Great shot.
- I got him!

01:01:08.137 --> 01:01:10.565
Hey, Chief, no!

01:01:16.979 --> 01:01:19.744
- Attaboy, Chief.
- Come on, Chief!

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.616
You got it.

01:01:22.716 --> 01:01:24.442
Good work, Chief!

01:01:28.057 --> 01:01:29.859
- Oh, shit.
- What's that?

01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:31.861
Double time, Chief.

01:01:32.661 --> 01:01:35.656
- Come on, Chief!
- Come on. Come on!

01:01:41.837 --> 01:01:44.859
- Shit, it's jammed. It's jammed.
- What? No!

01:01:45.908 --> 01:01:47.594
Come on!

01:01:50.062 --> 01:01:51.417
Faster, Chief!

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.855
Come on, Chief! Come on!

01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:02.966
- You're almost there.
- Come on!

01:02:12.234 --> 01:02:14.730
Look at the size of him.

01:02:35.391 --> 01:02:37.460
It ain't bad.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.756
Could use cheese.

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:44.142
I said it could use cheese.

01:02:44.767 --> 01:02:48.292
Tastes like chicken, raw chicken.

01:02:52.975 --> 01:02:56.258
So I thought when you saw a bird,
it means you're near land.

01:02:56.812 --> 01:02:58.647
Not this bird.

01:02:58.747 --> 01:03:01.876
They range for thousands of miles.

01:03:03.953 --> 01:03:06.956
I still can't believe
you shot an albatross.

01:03:07.056 --> 01:03:08.824
Why?

01:03:09.224 --> 01:03:11.173
Never mind.

01:03:11.727 --> 01:03:13.816
Tony, come on, eat up.

01:04:11.353 --> 01:04:13.716
I don't blame you.

01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:16.715
I'd leave if I could, too.

01:04:28.437 --> 01:04:32.698
Pastula, take another drift sight.
That's not how I'm reading those wave tops.

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.869
Pastula?

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.920
Aldrich! We've lost Pastula!

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.277
- ...nowhere, Chief. We're lost.
- Aldrich!

01:04:50.325 --> 01:04:53.428
Enterprise, this is 6-tare-12.

01:04:53.528 --> 01:04:57.727
No, check that, 6-tare-14
requesting an inbound bearing.

01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:01.132
Enterprise!

01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:04.574
Enterprise! Help me!

01:05:24.126 --> 01:05:26.413
There's no watch.

01:05:34.436 --> 01:05:36.794
All hands on deck.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.975
I gave orders...

01:05:40.075 --> 01:05:43.145
to maintain a 24-hour watch...

01:05:43.245 --> 01:05:46.415
- and you're sleeping on duty.
- What difference does it make?

01:05:46.515 --> 01:05:50.786
If that wind shifts,
and we don't deploy our anchor,

01:05:50.886 --> 01:05:53.556
- we lose ground, Aldrich.
- I don't feel any wind, Chief.

01:05:53.656 --> 01:05:56.288
It's 'cause there ain't any.
It's been dead for two days.

01:05:56.388 --> 01:05:59.422
Shut your mouth! Just shut your mouth!

01:06:01.763 --> 01:06:03.766
I ordered a watch.
There will be a watch.

01:06:04.865 --> 01:06:06.738
Sure, Chief.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.537
Whatever you say.

01:06:08.637 --> 01:06:10.940
- I'll take the watch.
- No, you won't, Tony.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.308
You want a damn watch so bad?

01:06:13.408 --> 01:06:15.844
Why don't you sit here
staring at nothing all day?

01:06:15.944 --> 01:06:19.415
- I do my share. More.
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:19.515 --> 01:06:22.584
Who do you think is navigating
this ship? Are you?

01:06:22.684 --> 01:06:25.556
Then where are these islands
you told us about?

01:06:25.656 --> 01:06:27.222
Yeah.

01:06:27.322 --> 01:06:30.559
- It must be close, right?
- Don't you touch that!

01:06:31.659 --> 01:06:34.600
You boys, you can't even swim,
much less read a map.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.165
Let me ask you something?

01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:39.468
How'd you come up with that chart
of yours anyway?

01:06:39.568 --> 01:06:43.172
I... I studied the area map
in the ready room every day.

01:06:43.272 --> 01:06:47.009
I have a rough picture of it in my mind,
plus or minus 10%, I'm hoping for.

01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:50.012
After that, it's simple dead reckoning!

01:06:50.112 --> 01:06:51.682
A rough picture?

01:06:51.782 --> 01:06:55.518
Dead reckoning works when you know
where you're starting from, right?

01:06:56.318 --> 01:06:58.754
So this route you figured,

01:06:58.854 --> 01:07:01.123
it's based on where you think
we went down,

01:07:01.223 --> 01:07:04.693
followed by a bunch of estimates
after that in where we've gotten each day.

01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:07.529
- What's your point?
- My point?

01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:10.232
The reason we went down is because...

01:07:10.332 --> 01:07:12.101
you didn't know
where we were to start with.

01:07:12.201 --> 01:07:15.104
- Now hold on...
- That's why we couldn't find the ship.

01:07:15.204 --> 01:07:18.273
That's why I couldn't
raise her on the radio.

01:07:18.373 --> 01:07:20.976
You had gotten us so far off,
we were out of range.

01:07:21.076 --> 01:07:25.714
- I tried to take that into account.
- And that's with instrument's and a real map!

01:07:26.014 --> 01:07:29.618
And here we've gone all these days
without so much as a compass.

01:07:29.718 --> 01:07:33.689
In the first couple of days,
we hardly kept track,

01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:38.086
and you're gonna put us on some
teeny islands in the middle of all this.

01:07:39.928 --> 01:07:44.099
- I...
- All a big guess, ain't it, Chief?

01:07:44.199 --> 01:07:49.371
Now listen... yes, yes, yes.
I'm relying on my recall.

01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:51.640
I may have made
a few estimates, but I...

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:55.277
I was trying to head us
dead center to these islands

01:07:55.377 --> 01:07:59.443
- so even if we were off somewhat...
- What do you mean was trying?

01:08:00.415 --> 01:08:02.470
When are you expecting to see 'em?

01:08:07.422 --> 01:08:09.079
It's...

01:08:13.795 --> 01:08:14.957
three days ago.

01:08:17.499 --> 01:08:19.524
Or four.

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:22.743
There should be islands
all around us by now.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:27.231
We missed them.

01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:33.837
We missed them.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.087
That's the way islands are, Tony,
didn't you know?

01:08:39.187 --> 01:08:41.823
You raise them and they're passed.
It's a one-chance deal.

01:08:41.924 --> 01:08:45.361
- You miss Hawaii, next stop, Tokyo.
- Now you listen to me...

01:08:45.461 --> 01:08:49.131
It's dead reckoning, all right,
'cause I reckon we're dead out here.

01:08:49.231 --> 01:08:51.800
Do you wanna take over? Smart mouth?

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.603
- Guys, please...
- I don't give a God damn!

01:08:55.103 --> 01:08:57.826
And you're Mr. High and Mighty,

01:08:58.225 --> 01:09:00.917
keeping your shoes
after we've thrown ours away,

01:09:01.017 --> 01:09:05.371
and you're all over me about the radio
like I had missed something!

01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:09.084
<i>"What did Aldrich do with the radio?"</i>

01:09:09.184 --> 01:09:12.054
<i>And you're all over Tony
about this drift sighting</i>

01:09:12.154 --> 01:09:15.180
<i>because he got the same read
on both legs.</i>

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:18.761
Well, what the hell
were you doing up there?

01:09:18.861 --> 01:09:24.854
Besides getting us lost on the biggest body
of water in the whole damn world?

01:09:26.935 --> 01:09:28.899
<i>Chief, I've lost the beacon. Over.</i>

01:09:30.639 --> 01:09:32.935
Are we close, Chief?

01:09:34.376 --> 01:09:36.745
Maybe his com is down.

01:09:36.845 --> 01:09:39.048
I'll give him a tap.

01:09:39.598 --> 01:09:43.318
Chief, can you hear us? Over.

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.120
Loud and clear, boys.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:48.679
Just waiting for this wind to tell me
which way she wants to blow.

01:09:57.165 --> 01:09:59.393
I think I fell asleep.

01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:08.310
It was so hot... up there.

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:12.438
I... it couldn't have been more
than a couple of minutes but...

01:10:16.785 --> 01:10:19.106
So we missed the turn.

01:10:21.323 --> 01:10:24.752
- By the time that we made it...
- It was way too late.

01:10:31.783 --> 01:10:34.209
I got us lost.

01:10:37.139 --> 01:10:41.109
And I don't know how to square it
with you boys, ever.

01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:43.230
I can't.

01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:48.417
I'm a pilot...

01:10:48.617 --> 01:10:51.837
who lost his plane...

01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:55.048
and his crew...

01:10:56.558 --> 01:10:58.579
and myself.

01:11:03.065 --> 01:11:05.286
I'm terribly sorry.

01:11:08.303 --> 01:11:10.893
I'm terribly sorry, men.

01:11:13.608 --> 01:11:15.304
I'm sorry.

01:11:54.874 --> 01:11:56.461
This map ain't much.

01:12:02.324 --> 01:12:05.414
But it's the only thing
we got to get us home.

01:12:16.872 --> 01:12:20.075
It looks like the only wind
we're generating is our own, fellas.

01:12:20.175 --> 01:12:22.243
I reckon so.

01:12:22.643 --> 01:12:26.005
That is exactly what we need to do.

01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:30.335
- Where are my shoes?
- Oh, here we go.

01:12:30.435 --> 01:12:32.255
No, no.

01:12:33.755 --> 01:12:35.824
Give me your knife.

01:12:35.924 --> 01:12:38.117
Please give me your knife.

01:12:57.345 --> 01:12:58.565
Okay.

01:13:09.424 --> 01:13:11.277
Gentlemen?

01:13:12.074 --> 01:13:14.541
Let's make our own wind.

01:13:28.076 --> 01:13:32.781
Tell you what,
whoever sees land first gets dinner.

01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:36.318
Anything he wants, anywhere he wants,
the other two will buy.

01:13:36.418 --> 01:13:37.886
Deal.

01:13:37.986 --> 01:13:41.223
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

01:13:41.323 --> 01:13:43.819
You won't find that funny
in a few minutes.

01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:19.486
Hen-Ry.

01:14:21.529 --> 01:14:23.798
Put on...

01:14:23.898 --> 01:14:25.655
the pot.

01:14:44.986 --> 01:14:48.584
Okay. Let's get to it.

01:14:53.478 --> 01:14:54.424
Gene.

01:15:20.188 --> 01:15:23.611
Either of you... know insurance?

01:15:25.759 --> 01:15:27.617
Insurance?

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:30.389
Life insurance.

01:15:32.067 --> 01:15:35.897
I have a $5,000 policy
to go to my mother.

01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:39.829
I was wondering
if she was able to collect.

01:15:40.675 --> 01:15:44.780
After a whole month... I imagine so.

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.282
I wonder how Irene's getting along.

01:15:47.382 --> 01:15:49.593
She sounds like a real nice girl.

01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:56.124
She works for a doctor now.

01:15:56.724 --> 01:15:57.993
You said that.

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:01.850
I used to write her poetry.

01:16:02.597 --> 01:16:05.200
We'd sure like to hear
one of those poems.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.357
That's right.

01:16:09.304 --> 01:16:11.466
Give us a poem.

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:18.900
Tony?

01:17:08.162 --> 01:17:10.465
Feel that, boys?

01:17:10.565 --> 01:17:12.654
We might be getting a drink.

01:17:13.501 --> 01:17:15.337
It's a strange one.

01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:21.262
Earhart. You know that woman flyer?
Amelia Earhart.

01:17:22.911 --> 01:17:25.673
She went down in these parts, right?

01:17:27.549 --> 01:17:28.742
Here it comes.

01:17:57.278 --> 01:17:58.874
That was chilly.

01:18:19.601 --> 01:18:21.648
Another shower?

01:18:23.104 --> 01:18:24.072
I don't like it.

01:18:24.172 --> 01:18:28.476
Clouds are moving
in opposite directions. What is it?

01:18:28.576 --> 01:18:31.165
Get ready.
We're gonna have to bail fast.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.156
Are there hurricanes in the Pacific?

01:18:41.256 --> 01:18:43.057
Affirmative!

01:18:43.499 --> 01:18:45.922
So when's hurricane season?

01:18:48.363 --> 01:18:50.955
Why do I keep asking these questions?

01:19:00.353 --> 01:19:01.777
- Take this!
- Why?

01:19:01.877 --> 01:19:03.602
You can't swim, remember?

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:10.885
You know what I could go for right now?

01:19:10.985 --> 01:19:12.308
Get down!

01:19:15.423 --> 01:19:17.392
Chief! Chief!

01:19:17.492 --> 01:19:20.061
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

01:19:20.161 --> 01:19:21.826
- Chief!
- Chief!

01:19:24.932 --> 01:19:26.701
We're coming, Chief!

01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:29.163
- Come on!
- Come on, Chief!

01:19:32.907 --> 01:19:34.999
We got ya.

01:19:38.846 --> 01:19:42.374
Stay with the raft!

01:19:44.152 --> 01:19:46.134
Hang on!

01:20:05.773 --> 01:20:07.909
Gene, where's Tony?

01:20:08.009 --> 01:20:09.900
I lost him.

01:20:17.552 --> 01:20:20.941
Work your way around!
See if you can spot him!

01:20:21.723 --> 01:20:24.492
Tony! Tony!

01:20:24.592 --> 01:20:27.757
Tony! Tony!

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:30.865
- Tony!
- Tony!

01:20:30.965 --> 01:20:32.267
Tony!

01:20:32.767 --> 01:20:35.529
- Tony!
- Tony!

01:20:44.746 --> 01:20:47.081
It's okay. Chief!

01:20:47.181 --> 01:20:48.801
Chief!

01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:51.577
Good boy.

01:20:57.792 --> 01:21:00.762
All right. We have to flip her!

01:21:01.562 --> 01:21:05.734
On my mark, we'll lift
and let the wind catch her!

01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:08.436
- But hold on to it!
- Yeah.

01:21:08.536 --> 01:21:11.539
One, two, three!

01:21:11.639 --> 01:21:12.969
Lift!

01:21:16.711 --> 01:21:19.239
You go around the other side!

01:21:20.315 --> 01:21:23.180
I'll hold it down! You get in first!

01:21:36.297 --> 01:21:38.127
Well done!

01:22:03.691 --> 01:22:06.160
Rub-a-dub-dub...

01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.822
three men in a tub.

01:22:09.897 --> 01:22:12.726
And who do you think they be?

01:22:14.736 --> 01:22:19.028
The butcher, the baker,
the candlestick maker.

01:22:20.174 --> 01:22:23.663
Turn them out, knaves all three.

01:22:24.646 --> 01:22:27.943
How is it I just now
thought of that one?

01:22:29.784 --> 01:22:32.146
The raft will sink.

01:22:32.753 --> 01:22:34.678
Won't it?

01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:37.779
Yeah.

01:22:39.527 --> 01:22:41.989
There'll be nothing left of us.

01:22:44.732 --> 01:22:46.455
No.

01:22:47.735 --> 01:22:51.260
No one will know
we survived all this time.

01:22:52.573 --> 01:22:54.369
No.

01:22:56.911 --> 01:22:59.639
Suppose one of us dies.

01:23:01.516 --> 01:23:03.708
What do the others do?

01:23:06.037 --> 01:23:09.207
Gene, you're always talking about food.
What do you think?

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:12.579
The liver anyhow.

01:23:13.427 --> 01:23:15.463
Heart if you can get to it.

01:23:15.563 --> 01:23:20.055
But we lost the pliers
and your pocketknife.

01:23:20.802 --> 01:23:22.966
Kidneys would be easy.

01:23:24.272 --> 01:23:26.964
Yeah, one for each man.

01:23:32.113 --> 01:23:35.208
I think we need some other kind of talk.

01:23:35.883 --> 01:23:39.139
I'm trying.
But everything's so far away.

01:23:41.822 --> 01:23:44.148
Just remembered something.

01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:49.989
My wife...

01:23:51.799 --> 01:23:54.963
she had a pretty yellow dress.

01:23:56.871 --> 01:24:00.828
She burned a hole in it
with her cigarette.

01:24:01.509 --> 01:24:05.798
So she sewed a little white dove
over the hole.

01:24:06.381 --> 01:24:10.477
I can picture the dress and the dove.

01:24:13.354 --> 01:24:16.041
But I can't really see her face.

01:24:31.873 --> 01:24:33.596
Tony.

01:24:37.545 --> 01:24:41.603
I do believe I am in love
with your sister.

01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:46.782
You'll make a great couple.

01:24:50.858 --> 01:24:53.628
I want you boys to know...

01:24:53.728 --> 01:24:55.890
if we had made it...

01:24:56.798 --> 01:24:59.788
I would have put you in
for commendations.

01:25:00.902 --> 01:25:03.404
If they would have listened to me
after my court martial.

01:25:03.504 --> 01:25:05.500
Court martial?

01:25:07.275 --> 01:25:09.317
Pastula?

01:25:09.577 --> 01:25:13.447
Can you think of anything they
could be court martialing the chief for?

01:25:13.547 --> 01:25:16.338
Not a thing I can think of, Aldrich.

01:25:17.552 --> 01:25:19.539
Me neither.

01:25:20.721 --> 01:25:23.616
I'm sorry it has to end this way.

01:25:28.362 --> 01:25:30.890
Man plots his course.

01:25:32.433 --> 01:25:34.856
But the Lord decides.

01:25:58.059 --> 01:25:59.748
All right.

01:26:01.863 --> 01:26:04.427
Enough of that bullshit.

01:26:06.367 --> 01:26:08.460
Seems to me...

01:26:10.104 --> 01:26:13.175
if God chose our course...

01:26:13.975 --> 01:26:17.434
it's 'cause He wants us to make it.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.766
Right?

01:26:25.086 --> 01:26:27.082
Either way...

01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:32.481
we've come way too far to give up now.

01:27:43.330 --> 01:27:44.958
Tony.

01:27:48.035 --> 01:27:49.797
Ton.

01:28:01.949 --> 01:28:05.940
Gene. Gene.

01:28:16.397 --> 01:28:18.686
Poor Tony.

01:28:28.943 --> 01:28:30.975
Tony.

01:28:36.317 --> 01:28:38.416
I can hear music.

01:28:39.987 --> 01:28:43.424
What kind of music... Tony?

01:28:43.955 --> 01:28:45.516
Can you hear it?

01:28:52.433 --> 01:28:56.231
I can see a beautiful field of corn.

01:28:57.605 --> 01:29:00.708
I saw our fleet...

01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:03.366
twice yesterday.

01:29:27.101 --> 01:29:29.060
No, no.

01:29:29.236 --> 01:29:31.495
Something green.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:35.466
Look, Chief.

01:30:04.588 --> 01:30:06.740
Gene Aldrich!

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.703
You have won yourself a dinner!

01:30:24.291 --> 01:30:25.550
Land ho!

01:30:32.065 --> 01:30:34.936
Thank you. Thank you.

01:30:35.036 --> 01:30:36.759
Paddle, boys! Paddle!

01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:42.128
Paddle!

01:30:59.893 --> 01:31:02.952
Stand down. Stand down.

01:31:03.797 --> 01:31:06.127
We should drift right in.

01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:14.972
What if there's Japanese?

01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:18.203
What choice do we have?

01:31:21.849 --> 01:31:25.910
Straight away, men.
We might be going over.

01:33:09.923 --> 01:33:11.651
Well?

01:36:12.606 --> 01:36:16.143
<i>Oh, the night was dark and dreary</i>

01:36:16.243 --> 01:36:19.497
<i>And the air was full of sleet</i>

01:36:19.597 --> 01:36:23.083
<i>Where the old man stood out in the storm</i>

01:36:23.183 --> 01:36:25.786
<i>And his shoes were full of feet</i>

01:36:25.886 --> 01:36:30.391
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:36:30.491 --> 01:36:33.694
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:36:33.794 --> 01:36:37.298
<i>But how in the world
can the old folks tell</i>

01:36:37.398 --> 01:36:40.301
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:44.055
<i>Well, a butterfly flits on wings of gold</i>

01:36:44.155 --> 01:36:47.491
<i>The June bug, wings of flame</i>

01:36:47.591 --> 01:36:50.744
<i>The bedbug has no wings at all</i>

01:36:50.844 --> 01:36:53.681
<i>But he gets there just the same</i>

01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:57.568
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:36:57.668 --> 01:37:01.272
<i>No, no, no more, no, no, no, no, no more</i>

01:37:01.372 --> 01:37:04.592
<i>How in the world can the old folks tell</i>

01:37:04.692 --> 01:37:07.108
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:37:07.208 --> 01:37:10.631
<i>Oh, the mosquitee, he fly high</i>

01:37:10.731 --> 01:37:14.435
<i>Oh, mosquitee, he fly low</i>

01:37:14.535 --> 01:37:18.059
<i>If old Mr. Skeeter light on me</i>

01:37:18.159 --> 01:37:20.658
<i>He ain't a-gonna fly no more</i>

01:37:20.758 --> 01:37:25.084
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:37:28.399 --> 01:37:31.552
<i>How in the world can the old folks tell</i>

01:37:31.652 --> 01:37:34.438
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:37:34.538 --> 01:37:38.025
<i>Well, a bullfrog sitting on a lily pad</i>

01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:40.978
<i>Looking up at the skies</i>

01:37:41.078 --> 01:37:44.465
<i>Oh, the lily pad broke,
and the frog fell in</i>

01:37:44.565 --> 01:37:47.351
<i>Got water all in his eyes</i>

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:51.850
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:37:55.059 --> 01:37:58.295
<i>How in the world can the old folks tell</i>

01:37:58.395 --> 01:38:01.132
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:38:01.232 --> 01:38:04.618
<i>Well, here's a verse about a man
and a trombone</i>

01:38:04.718 --> 01:38:08.105
<i>Well, the words to it are few</i>

01:38:08.205 --> 01:38:11.625
<i>He blew, he blew, he blew, he blew</i>

01:38:11.725 --> 01:38:14.345
<i>He blew, he blew, he blew</i>

01:38:14.445 --> 01:38:18.748
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:38:21.902 --> 01:38:25.256
<i>How in the world can the old folks tell</i>

01:38:25.356 --> 01:38:28.142
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:38:28.242 --> 01:38:31.812
<i>Well, a man lay down by a sewer</i>

01:38:31.912 --> 01:38:35.282
<i>And by the sewer he died, he died</i>

01:38:35.382 --> 01:38:38.202
<i>And at the coroner's request</i>

01:38:38.302 --> 01:38:41.088
<i>They called it sewer-side</i>

01:38:41.188 --> 01:38:45.092
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:38:45.192 --> 01:38:48.549
<i>Oh, Lord, ain't gonna rain no more</i>

01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:51.916
<i>How in the world can the old folks tell</i>

01:38:52.016 --> 01:38:54.802
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:38:54.902 --> 01:38:58.122
<i>A little black and white animal
out in the woods</i>

01:38:58.222 --> 01:39:02.009
<i>I says ain't that little cat pretty</i>

01:39:02.109 --> 01:39:04.962
<i>I went right over to pick it up</i>

01:39:05.062 --> 01:39:07.665
<i>But it wasn't that kind of a kitty</i>

01:39:07.765 --> 01:39:12.203
<i>Oh, it ain't a-gonna rain
no more, no more</i>

01:39:12.303 --> 01:39:15.239
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:39:15.339 --> 01:39:18.976
<i>But how in the world
can the old folks tell</i>

01:39:19.076 --> 01:39:22.062
<i>Ain't a-gonna rain no more</i>

01:39:22.162 --> 01:39:26.285
<i>No more, no more, no more.</i>
