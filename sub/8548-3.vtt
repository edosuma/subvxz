47:42.660 --> 47:44.787
Eddie, the forks go on the left.

47:45.229 --> 47:47.720
- On the left?
- Right.

47:47.898 --> 47:49.160
Oh, on the right.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.801
Well, that makes sense.
We're all right-handed.

47:51.969 --> 47:55.769
No, genius. When I said right,
I meant left was right.

47:58.075 --> 47:59.337
Great news, everyone.

47:59.510 --> 48:02.308
I stopped on the way home
and bought us a pizza for dinner.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.916
Thank goodness.
We can eat with our hands.

49:35.105 --> 49:39.371
- Grandma. Grandma. Grandma.
ESTELLE: Hmm.

49:39.543 --> 49:41.067
Anything for me?

49:41.245 --> 49:44.339
Grandma. Grandma.

49:44.782 --> 49:46.306
- Grandma.
- Oh.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.678
- This one looks important.
- That must be for me.

49:48.953 --> 49:52.821
- Grandma.
- Oh, this is from Barbara Bush.

49:53.390 --> 49:55.187
- You know Barbara Bush?
- Oh, sure.

49:55.359 --> 49:58.089
But I haven't heard from them
since they moved.

49:59.296 --> 50:01.696
- Here's one for you, Dad.
- Thank you.

50:02.433 --> 50:05.197
Oh, terrific. A water bill.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.194
Here's one for Rachel.

50:07.371 --> 50:09.271
- Should I give it to her?
- Let me give it.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.305
Makes me feel important.

50:13.577 --> 50:16.341
Hey, Rachel, you got a letter.

50:16.814 --> 50:18.907
<i>Oh, it's from Sci-fi magazine.</i>

50:19.083 --> 50:21.779
- I sent them a great short story.
- I don't believe it.

50:21.952 --> 50:24.750
- You haven't even read her story.
- I don't mean her story.

50:24.922 --> 50:26.389
I mean the water bill.

50:26.557 --> 50:29.492
Did we get a swimming pool
and nobody told me?

50:29.660 --> 50:31.218
Look at that.

50:32.363 --> 50:33.728
It is a little high.

50:33.898 --> 50:35.126
A little high?

50:35.299 --> 50:38.200
They don't use this much water
at SeaWorld.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.437
This is terrible.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.603
They rejected my story.

50:45.109 --> 50:49.205
Oh, Rachel, I'm sorry. I guess this has been
a tough day for both of us, huh?

50:52.149 --> 50:54.674
Great news, Dad.
I'm all finished washing the car.

50:56.553 --> 50:58.453
You washed the car?

50:58.622 --> 51:00.385
With water?

51:01.759 --> 51:03.590
Boy, why did you do that?

51:04.728 --> 51:06.161
Because you told me to?

51:06.597 --> 51:09.566
Edward, I told you two weeks ago
when we could afford it.

51:10.734 --> 51:13.601
I don't believe this.
I did something good and I'm in trouble.

51:13.971 --> 51:15.131
Big trouble.

51:15.306 --> 51:19.242
And from now on, ask me
before you do something I told you to do.

51:22.112 --> 51:24.740
I'm sorry they rejected your story.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.678
It was a great idea.

51:26.850 --> 51:29.375
It was about this trucker
who has a whole lot of tattoos.

51:29.954 --> 51:33.720
Then one day,
he notices his tattoos are changing.

51:33.891 --> 51:40.023
Finally, he realizes they're not tattoos at all,
but aliens with really low self-esteem.

51:43.734 --> 51:44.928
Uh-huh.

51:45.469 --> 51:49.838
- I'm doing a Stephen King sort of thing.
- Let me tell you where you're going wrong.

51:50.007 --> 51:53.067
Shouldn't be wasting your time
writing about truckers and tattoos.

51:53.243 --> 51:55.871
Gotta be writing about things
you know about.

52:01.385 --> 52:04.149
Carl! Carl!

52:05.589 --> 52:07.523
Now, don't panic.

52:12.062 --> 52:15.031
The water will just be off
for four hours a day.

52:17.368 --> 52:20.963
Now, I know we can all live with that,
and think of the money we'll be saving.

52:22.206 --> 52:25.403
I know how we can save a lot more money.
Nobody eats.

52:26.744 --> 52:28.871
I'll turn it right back on.

52:38.389 --> 52:41.324
- Hi, Aunt Rachel.
- Hi, baby.

52:41.492 --> 52:42.891
How was school?

52:43.060 --> 52:44.322
I can get A's in my sleep.

52:44.728 --> 52:47.356
The public-school system
is geared for kids like Eddie.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.597
- How's the story coming?
- It's not.

52:52.770 --> 52:56.433
I keep getting a lot of ideas
but none of them amount to anything.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.575
I'm sort of blocked.

52:58.742 --> 53:01.768
CARL:
All right, I want everyone in this house...

53:01.945 --> 53:05.540
...in the living room,
right now on the double.

53:05.749 --> 53:07.080
Uh-oh.

53:07.251 --> 53:09.617
It's Aquaman.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.550
All right.

53:13.824 --> 53:15.348
Who did it?

53:15.726 --> 53:17.660
Who left the sprinkler on all day?

53:17.828 --> 53:20.888
The front yard looks like a rice paddy.

53:21.932 --> 53:24.765
Don't look at me.
I don't do outside work.

53:26.837 --> 53:28.737
- I didn't do it.
- Not me.

53:29.039 --> 53:32.133
I haven't done anything. I'm blocked.

53:32.810 --> 53:33.868
Well, who could it be?

53:35.079 --> 53:36.341
Hi, everybody.

53:38.415 --> 53:40.110
Edward.

53:41.251 --> 53:43.014
Son.

53:43.253 --> 53:45.312
Did you turn on the sprinkler today?

53:46.056 --> 53:48.923
Yeah, I did, Dad.
I turned it on this morning.

53:49.093 --> 53:51.584
And without even being asked.

53:51.795 --> 53:55.629
But you forgot to turn it off.

53:56.934 --> 54:00.199
I got you there, Dad.
You didn't tell me that part.

54:01.105 --> 54:05.098
Edward,
the human body is 65 percent water.

54:05.275 --> 54:08.608
If we come up short,
you're the first to go.

54:10.013 --> 54:12.345
You're getting out of hand
with this water thing.

54:12.516 --> 54:13.847
Out of hand?

54:14.017 --> 54:17.009
I have to rent scuba gear
to get the evening paper.

54:17.187 --> 54:19.951
From now on,
nobody uses a drop of water in this house...

54:20.124 --> 54:21.887
...without written permission from me.

54:22.059 --> 54:23.390
- Oh, come on.
LAURA: Come on.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.824
HARRIETTE:
What do you mean? I've got to get...

54:25.996 --> 54:30.160
I wonder if George and Barbara
have an extra room.

54:31.168 --> 54:34.137
CARL: I work too hard.
I only make $305 a week.

54:34.304 --> 54:38.206
Aunt Rachel, you want something
to write about, write about this family.

54:38.375 --> 54:41.970
People love stories
about domestic violence.

54:51.788 --> 54:54.348
- Mama, we are doing good.
- Hm?

54:54.525 --> 54:55.992
We are doing real good.

54:56.660 --> 54:59.891
I have been checking the meter now
every day for the past two weeks...

55:00.063 --> 55:02.691
...and water consumption
is finally under control.

55:03.500 --> 55:08.369
Good.
Now maybe I can firm up my waterbed.

55:11.909 --> 55:16.175
I'm really getting sick of this.
I want some of that mail and I want it now.

55:16.613 --> 55:20.071
Okay. Here. Take this.

55:21.118 --> 55:22.210
This is junk mail.

55:22.386 --> 55:25.446
You're new in this profession.
You've got to start at the bottom.

55:25.789 --> 55:27.552
I was born at the bottom.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.427
Here you go. Grandma.

55:34.264 --> 55:35.788
<i>[SINGING]
You put your right foot out</i>

55:35.966 --> 55:38.730
<i>You put your right foot...</i>

55:43.040 --> 55:47.136
Come on, baby.
This is a top-of-the-line teething ring.

55:52.516 --> 55:54.211
He hates this thing.

55:54.785 --> 55:56.343
You're doing it all wrong.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.518
Well, excuse me.
It didn't come with instructions.

56:00.257 --> 56:01.656
Watch and learn.

56:02.226 --> 56:04.990
Dip it in a little apple sauce.

56:06.129 --> 56:08.620
Here you go, sweetie. Mm, mm.

56:13.036 --> 56:16.267
Oh, sure. Anybody can do it that way.

56:16.607 --> 56:19.098
Mail call for Aunt Rachel.

56:20.577 --> 56:22.545
- That's for dinner.
- Sorry.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.510
This is from the magazine
I sent my new short story to.

56:26.683 --> 56:28.344
Open it. Open it.

56:30.654 --> 56:33.054
Well, what did they say?
What did they say?

56:33.557 --> 56:35.684
I sold my story. I sold it! I sold it!

56:35.859 --> 56:38.453
- I sold it!
- You sold it. You sold it. You sold it.

56:38.629 --> 56:40.859
Now, am I gonna get a chance to read it?

56:41.031 --> 56:43.465
I didn't want you to see it
until I knew it was good.

56:43.634 --> 56:45.898
I'm gonna go out now
and make copies for everyone.

56:46.069 --> 56:48.970
- Will you watch little Richie for me? Good.
- Sure, no problem.

56:49.139 --> 56:51.699
Oh, by the way,
he needs changing. Thanks.

56:53.910 --> 56:57.038
Laura, get down here.

56:57.247 --> 56:59.306
The baby needs changing.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.828
So, what did you think of my story?

57:20.037 --> 57:21.937
Rachel, this story is about us.

57:22.572 --> 57:24.665
No, it's not. I made it up.

57:24.841 --> 57:26.240
You made it up?

57:26.410 --> 57:29.641
The story is about a woman
who moves in with her sister's family.

57:29.813 --> 57:32.577
The father's a cop,
the mother works at a newspaper.

57:32.749 --> 57:35.775
And they live in a house
with their three kids and a grandmother.

57:36.353 --> 57:39.811
Okay, I know that sounds like this family.

57:39.990 --> 57:42.424
But I just used you
as a jumping-off point.

57:42.793 --> 57:45.660
I don't think you jumped far enough.

57:47.531 --> 57:50.091
You make me seem pushy.
I'm not pushy.

57:50.267 --> 57:52.201
- Yeah.
- Hush up, Carl.

57:53.437 --> 57:55.302
I want you to take me out of the story.

57:55.706 --> 57:57.003
Mother Winslow...

57:57.174 --> 57:59.938
And you make me seem like
some kind of cheapskate.

58:00.110 --> 58:02.203
Got that part right.

58:02.979 --> 58:04.810
I don't know why you guys are so upset.

58:04.981 --> 58:08.280
She made me seem like
some kind of smart-mouthed know-it-all.

58:11.588 --> 58:15.149
Come on, guys,
it's just a little story for a magazine.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.418
I doubt if anyone we know
will even read it.

58:17.594 --> 58:21.826
What about me?
You said I whine. I don't whine.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.930
Honey, it's not about you.

58:26.203 --> 58:28.569
Way to go, Rachel.

58:29.639 --> 58:32.267
Come on, guys, I made it up, really.

58:32.442 --> 58:35.605
I mean, hasn't anyone noticed
the family is nothing like us?

58:35.779 --> 58:37.747
They have cable.

58:38.849 --> 58:41.875
Aunt Rachel, I love your story.

58:42.052 --> 58:45.510
Finally, someone who knows it's fiction.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.783
What fiction? You captured the real me.

58:48.959 --> 58:52.258
A guy who's great with the babes.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.798
That is the only part that is fiction.

58:57.934 --> 58:58.992
Oh, yeah?

59:00.804 --> 59:04.240
Don't be hitting nobody on the head.
You're all crazy enough as it is.

59:08.011 --> 59:11.412
Harriette, you haven't said a word.

59:11.581 --> 59:14.607
You're a reasonable person.
What did you think of my story?

59:17.854 --> 59:19.913
You wanna know what I think
about this story?

59:21.425 --> 59:23.290
Maybe not.

59:24.261 --> 59:27.128
Rachel,
I think this story is about you and me.

59:27.664 --> 59:31.862
How you see me as this overbearing
big sister who's always pushing you around.

59:32.035 --> 59:34.936
Well, it's nice to finally know
how you really feel about me.

59:35.505 --> 59:38.372
Harriette, it's just a little story.

59:38.675 --> 59:41.542
Well, your words speak louder
than your words.

59:44.548 --> 59:47.278
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. I'm fired up.

59:49.886 --> 59:53.014
Harriette, come on.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.228
So you see, Mother Winslow,
that's the way we writers do it.

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:13.137
- Oh.
- We take somebody we might know...

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.676
...and use them as a model
for fictional characters.

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:18.212
- Uh-huh.
- Like Hemingway.

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.008
He used his friends in his stories.

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:22.649
I met Hemingway in Cuba once.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.845
All sizzle and no steak.

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:29.586
Rachel, well,
I convinced Harriette to talk to you.

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:32.091
Now, you're gonna have to do the rest.

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:33.695
Thanks, Carl.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:37.766
- Excuse me, Mother Winslow.
- I'll be praying for you, honey.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.634
[SIGHS]

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.003
Okay, Harriette.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:51.705
Now, I know that you two
can straighten out this misunderstanding.

01:00:51.882 --> 01:00:56.251
So now, just go right ahead.
Straighten out the misunderstanding.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:00:58.721
Right out.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.863
Harriette, I'm really sorry this upset you.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:12.092
I was just trying to do what you told me,
write about what I know.

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:16.237
See? Now, come on,
let's all go out and get some ice cream.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.134
I just wanna ask you one thing, Rachel.

01:01:21.311 --> 01:01:23.802
Did you mean all that stuff
you wrote about me?

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.777
It's not you, Harriette.

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.076
Henrietta is a fictional character.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:32.010
See? Now, come on,
let's go get that ice cream. Come on.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:37.482
So you don't think I try to control
your life like that sister in the story?

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:40.425
Well, not all the time.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.524
What do you mean, not all the time?

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.567
Well, sometimes
you do try to control my life.

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:48.727
When? Name one time.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.430
Ha! I could name a hundred times.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:54.270
You tell me how to dress,
how to do my makeup.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:58.244
And you even gave me a lecture
on how to give my baby a teething ring.

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:01.111
You know,
that really made my hair stand on end.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.918
Well, it would be a lot better
than the way you're wearing it now.

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:11.292
You know, I don't think
I've put enough of you in my story.

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.691
I may have to do a novel.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:16.855
How would you like to do it in traction?

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:20.831
Did they make up?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.036
Well, they were close.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:25.970
Real close.

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:27.867
Mm-hm.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.210
Ooh. You look bad.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:36.977
I know.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:42.180
Where you going?
You smell like you gargled with Aqua Velva.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.661
I'm going over to Linda Fontana's house
to ask her out.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:50.732
Then you better go back upstairs first
because you forgot your brain.

01:02:51.034 --> 01:02:53.559
Linda Fontana is the prettiest girl
in your school.

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:55.796
There's no way
she's gonna go out with you.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:59.171
See, Aunt Rachel's story
taught me a lot about women.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:02.004
I figure Linda's waiting
for a real man to come along.

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.978
One who's not intimidated by her beauty.

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.877
And that's me.

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:12.119
Edward "Stud" Winslow.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.282
How much of that cologne
did you swallow?

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:28.869
So have you made up with Rachel yet?

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.575
Well, I guess not.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:39.279
Rachel, you're just in time for lunch.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:43.283
Carl, would you please tell Harriette
I'll be eating lunch in my room.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.887
Carl, would you please tell Rachel
if she's eating in her room...

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:50.049
...she better call for pizza.
My food is not leaving this kitchen.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:53.161
Carl, would you tell Harriette
that that is just fine with me.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.058
But... Wha...

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.962
Mom, if Judy and I fight,
can I have pizza in my room too?

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:05.268
Just a thought.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.900
Harriette...

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.647
...how can you still be upset
at Rachel's story?

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:13.783
All the rest of us have forgiven her.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.145
Carl, she didn't do a number on you.

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:18.753
You were just a tightwad
and a blowhard.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.088
She thinks I'm a terrible sister.

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.557
All these years,
I thought I was helping her out.

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:29.597
All the time, she's been seeing me as
some tyrant who's trying to control her life.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.397
You know what I think?

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:34.560
I think the two of you
have let this thing get way out of hand...

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:37.332
...and it is now time to talk it out.

01:04:37.507 --> 01:04:39.566
I don't wanna talk to her.

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:44.374
Honey. Look,
I know you're hurting right now.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.345
But you wouldn't be hurting
if you didn't love her so much.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:51.510
I don't know how two people who love
each other the way you and Rachel do...

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:54.122
...can let something like this
come between you.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.851
And I know that neither one of you
are gonna be happy until you work it out.

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:01.519
Now, come on, honey, work it out.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.404
I don't wanna work it out.

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.250
Hi, Aunt Rachel.

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.416
Hi, baby.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.682
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.556
I guess you and Mom
still aren't talking, huh?

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:37.257
You know,
this is just about our worst fight ever.

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:39.128
Hey, don't let it get you down.

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:41.133
I know what it's like to be a sister.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.828
Judy and I fight all the time.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.700
Yeah?

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.933
Do you say really awful things to her?

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.372
Sure.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:51.173
Being a middle child
has to have some perks.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.080
But I don't really mean the things
that I say.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.981
I'd never tell her this, but I love the kid.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.380
Anybody seen my Bratty Kathy doll?

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:03.389
Beat it, you little rug rat.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:09.454
See? I wasn't really trying to hit her.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:12.795
But she has to learn to knock
before she enters.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.968
I think you should go apologize
right now.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:19.901
Oh, I will. What do you think?
I wanna ruin our relationship?

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.442
See, that's the important thing.

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.705
No matter what happens
between sisters...

01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:27.850
...you don't let it ruin the relationship.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.057
Well, I think she got the message.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:41.788
- How did I do?
- You were great.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:43.933
Your timing was perfect.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:48.059
I don't know how Mom and Aunt Rachel
ever got through life without us.

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.569
- Harriette, we've gotta talk.
- I'm listening.

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.572
I am so sorry I wrote that story.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:30.736
I never meant to hurt you.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.440
It's not about the story anymore.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:36.817
All right,
I'm sorry for everything else I said too.

01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:40.954
So you don't think I push you around
and try to control your life?

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:43.149
Okay. I don't feel that way.

01:07:43.326 --> 01:07:44.452
You do too.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:48.530
Okay, I do feel that way.

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:50.666
I don't know what you want me to say.

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.733
I want you to tell me the truth.

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:55.596
Fine.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.070
Sometimes,
I feel like you push me around.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.209
No, I don't.

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.505
I just give you advice.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:04.540
Harriette...

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:09.481
...you may mean it as advice,
but it comes across like giving orders.

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:13.520
It's like you don't respect me or you think
I'm not capable of thinking for myself.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.749
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:19.520
Ever since we were little girls,
you always talked to me that way.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:22.127
But I have nothing but respect for you,
Rachel.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:25.859
The type of person you are,
your values, your ability as a writer.

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:28.196
Those are things
I've always admired about you.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.399
Really?

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:35.337
Yeah, and if I boss you around sometimes,
it's only because I care about you...

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.274
...and want only the best for you.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:44.309
Well, you always have been strong
and dependable.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:45.578
Just like a second mom.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.020
Only younger.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.421
Well,
I can see you don't need me as a mother.

01:08:54.596 --> 01:08:56.587
You need me as a sister.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.964
Oh, that would be fine.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.466
Well, from now on,
when we're having a problem...

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:08.076
...I want you to tell me about it face to face
instead of putting it in a national magazine.

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:10.640
Fair enough.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.645
And I want you to let me know
if I'm getting pushy.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:15.044
Okay, I will.

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:18.513
No, I mean it. Whenever I'm getting pushy,
it's your job to say...

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:20.849
Harriette, you're being pushy.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:23.849
Boy, it sneaks up on you, doesn't it?

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:25.654
[LAUGHS]

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:28.992
So are we friends now?

01:09:29.432 --> 01:09:31.559
- Sure.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:36.330
- I missed you too.
- Oh, I knew you guys would work it out.

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:39.404
Oh, boy, I'm glad that's over.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:43.305
All I can say is I'm glad that story
didn't cause any more trouble than it did.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.981
CARL:
Edward.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:09:59.458
What happened to you?

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.863
I went over to Linda Fontana's house
to ask her out.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.059
And she beat you up?

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:11.031
Gee, whatever happened to girls
just saying no?

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.770
It wasn't her.

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:19.176
It was her boyfriend, Bubba.

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:25.579
Aunt Rachel, next time you write a story,
leave me out of it, please.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.586
Son, come on.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:32.558
I think it's time you and I had a little talk
about women and guys named Bubba.

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:36.186
Wow. What did you do?
Take a bath in cologne?

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:25.437
