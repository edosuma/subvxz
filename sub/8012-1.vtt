WEBVTT

01:22.208 --> 01:24.127
<i>- Let him burn!</i>

01:24.544 --> 01:26.421
<i>- You are going to die!</i>

01:27.589 --> 01:29.424
<i>- This is the last one!</i>

01:30.341 --> 01:33.386
<i>We have her!</i>

01:34.012 --> 01:35.764
<i>- Let's go, boys!</i>

01:48.193 --> 01:51.863
<i>- You will never get her! Never!</i>

01:59.204 --> 02:00.413
- Ah!

02:01.623 --> 02:02.791
<i>I've been hit!</i>

02:03.124 --> 02:05.293
<i>- Keep going! Go!</i>

02:05.418 --> 02:07.253
- Alexsandra!!!

03:13.069 --> 03:14.696
Jackson!

03:14.821 --> 03:16.489
- Jackson.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.666
There he is, Dad.

03:33.089 --> 03:35.174
He's alive.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.761
- Get him up.

03:38.887 --> 03:40.930
Get him up!

03:48.855 --> 03:51.065
Where is Alexsandra?

03:51.190 --> 03:53.943
Jackson, where is your wife?

03:54.068 --> 03:56.404
- She's been taken.

03:56.529 --> 03:57.989
Kidnapped.

03:59.741 --> 04:02.201
Bring me all the bullets you can.

04:02.327 --> 04:04.120
It'll be light soon.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.372
- Brought every rifle bullet
we could find.

04:48.373 --> 04:49.916
- Thank you, Timothy.

04:53.086 --> 04:55.672
- You know where they headed?
- Down the south trail,

04:55.797 --> 04:56.965
towards New Mexico.

04:57.966 --> 05:00.259
They spoke Spanish.

05:00.385 --> 05:03.680
If I'm right, I've got a friend
down that way.

05:03.805 --> 05:05.306
He can help me out.

05:05.431 --> 05:08.685
- I made this map myself 15 years ago.

05:08.810 --> 05:11.479
Now, there'll be new routes up there,
they'll turn you around.

05:11.604 --> 05:14.107
But you watch the mountains,
and they'll be your guide.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.945
You be careful.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.615
I haven't met
your new bride yet.

05:22.740 --> 05:26.494
I don't know what kinda mess you got
yourself into with these Mexicans,

05:26.619 --> 05:27.996
but you seem like a fine man.

05:28.121 --> 05:30.415
I wish you the best
in getting her back.

08:42.190 --> 08:44.275
- Yeah.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.277
That's a good boy.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.426
Where is she?

12:42.304 --> 12:45.474
<i>You will get what you deserve.</i>

12:46.350 --> 12:48.060
<i>You will get yours.</i>

12:53.607 --> 12:55.776
<i>- Hmm?</i>

12:55.901 --> 12:57.903
Where is she?

12:59.447 --> 13:01.073
- She's gone.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.701
And you'll die.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.504
<i>You are the damned.</i>

14:53.185 --> 14:54.770
- Hear that, Ace?

17:58.954 --> 18:01.165
How do you like that?!

18:11.759 --> 18:12.926
Ah!

18:16.764 --> 18:18.390
What are you doing?!

18:26.607 --> 18:27.775
That wasn't very nice!

19:33.257 --> 19:34.633
Excuse me.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.262
Sir!

19:56.488 --> 19:57.656
Sir.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.661
Look, I'm in a hurry.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.546
I'm no thief.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.381
My wife.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.302
She was taken.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.973
Down the south trail.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.851
By Mexicans.

20:31.732 --> 20:33.525
I need to get her back.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.573
- I see a rider.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.117
Three men, one woman.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.535
Ah-ah-ah!

20:45.704 --> 20:47.581
- Money.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.261
Two.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.973
- Five.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.892
No wife.

21:08.936 --> 21:10.103
- What?

21:12.147 --> 21:13.190
- No talk...

21:13.315 --> 21:15.317
no wife.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.788
Go now, or I shoot.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.539
Ah!

21:35.921 --> 21:39.091
- Well, sometimes,
I just can't help myself.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.762
Huh.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.968
Hello, sir!

22:24.386 --> 22:26.596
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.602
Just to keep you informed,

22:32.728 --> 22:34.354
this is my road,

22:34.479 --> 22:36.565
and as such,

22:36.690 --> 22:39.317
I collect a toll from
all travelers for safe passage.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.194
- What kind of toll?

22:42.237 --> 22:43.989
- Everything you got.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.410
Maybe even your soul.

22:52.164 --> 22:54.291
Your horse looks real nice.

22:54.416 --> 22:55.876
- The horse stays.

22:56.001 --> 22:58.378
- Well, that is not
your decision to make.

22:58.503 --> 23:01.048
You're on my road!

23:01.882 --> 23:04.301
And you will pay my price.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.219
And my price...

23:06.344 --> 23:08.180
includes that horse.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.438
Are you lookin' to die?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.694
You look like you wanna die.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.822
- You like killing unarmed men,
don't you?

23:28.033 --> 23:30.327
- I just like killin' men.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.872
Especially when
their conversation bores me so.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.255
Do I know you?

23:46.593 --> 23:49.262
You look awful familiar to me.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.524
Yes.

24:01.316 --> 24:04.736
I think I do know you. Yes, I do.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.951
We look tough, we act tough,

24:11.743 --> 24:14.955
but in the end,
we're just lonely, scared men.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.087
Well, I know a soldier
when I see one.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.966
You looking for a way
to forget the war?

24:27.551 --> 24:30.846
Forget all the horrible,
horrible things you did.

24:30.971 --> 24:32.347
- Shut up right now.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.516
- Oh, I like that.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.729
You know, I'd like to know
more about you.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.733
How does it make you feel...

24:44.776 --> 24:46.111
when I do that?

24:50.323 --> 24:52.367
Answer me, goddammit!

24:56.121 --> 24:57.998
Open up.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.335
You scared?

25:03.336 --> 25:05.422
Well, don't be scared.

25:05.547 --> 25:09.634
Sometimes I think about doing it
two, three times a day.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.761
Ah!

25:18.560 --> 25:20.187
- That's my answer.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.982
- I'm gonna kill you for that.
Ah!

25:24.107 --> 25:25.984
- Ah! Ah!

25:26.109 --> 25:28.195
Ah!

25:29.946 --> 25:32.032
- Oh... Oh!

25:32.616 --> 25:34.243
Wah!

27:27.105 --> 27:29.357
- Yeah, easy, boy.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.484
Easy,boy.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.012
Ah!

28:06.561 --> 28:09.064
He's <i>going</i> for his gun!

28:09.689 --> 28:11.483
<i>- Let's go! Let's go!</i>

28:14.652 --> 28:17.822
- Oh... oh... oh, Ace.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.158
Oh, Ace. Ah...

28:21.326 --> 28:22.952
Oh, no...

28:26.748 --> 28:29.209
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.759
I'm so sorry, pal.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.222
Good boy.

31:49.534 --> 31:52.537
- Only one thing I enjoy more
than killing a man.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.960
Watching a man die
all by himself.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.554
Death might be a favour to you.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.865
How you doing, friend?

32:28.990 --> 32:30.992
You still with us?

32:36.581 --> 32:37.707
What's that?

32:38.791 --> 32:39.834
- Fuck you.

32:41.586 --> 32:44.589
- Well, I don't know
if I can honour your dying wish,

32:44.714 --> 32:47.091
which really is sad for me.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.471
- Just... just kill me.

32:52.639 --> 32:55.308
- No, no, no, no, not so fast.

32:55.433 --> 32:58.519
Why, this is the best moment.

32:58.645 --> 33:01.064
Now, we don't want to rush this.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.661
- Just leave...

33:15.286 --> 33:16.871
leave me alone.

33:41.646 --> 33:44.857
- You know what I find most sad
about you?

33:46.275 --> 33:48.653
You are all alone...

33:50.071 --> 33:53.658
...in a world that don't
celebrate being alone.

35:14.197 --> 35:17.867
<i>Be thankful my son dragged you here</i>

35:17.992 --> 35:20.620
<i>behind his horse.</i>

35:22.413 --> 35:30.087
<i>There are stories of a killer on the trail.</i>

36:47.456 --> 36:50.418
<i>- He awakens. Look at him.</i>

36:51.460 --> 36:53.504
<i>He awakens and does not know where he is.</i>

37:00.011 --> 37:01.888
- Where are my guns?

37:20.239 --> 37:23.451
- <i>This one wants to steal</i> a <i>horse.</i>

37:39.884 --> 37:44.555
<i>You brought an evil white man into our camp.</i>

37:47.516 --> 37:51.228
<i>- This diseased filth needs to go.</i>

37:52.021 --> 37:55.149
<i>At the last village they told a story</i>

37:55.274 --> 37:59.236
<i>about a killer out there
killing men and taking women.</i>

37:59.362 --> 38:02.031
<i>- You saw him.</i>

38:02.365 --> 38:04.825
<i>He was possessed by evil spirits!</i>

38:04.951 --> 38:07.578
<i>- Seven winters...</i>

38:07.703 --> 38:10.122
<i>Seven women.</i>

38:10.623 --> 38:17.171
- <i>Father, it is my duty to honor
my commitment to save his life.</i>

38:19.799 --> 38:21.884
- <i>Go on, son.</i>

38:23.135 --> 38:27.723
- <i>I tried to force him into cold waters
with my bow.</i>

38:28.265 --> 38:35.398
<i>When his gun overcame me
he spared my life.</i>

38:48.661 --> 38:55.167
<i>- Your foolishness has brought
a great burden.</i>

38:56.419 --> 39:02.425
<i>We will find out what kind of man
you have brought amongst us.</i>

39:08.639 --> 39:11.809
<i>Bring him to the sweat lodge.</i>

39:16.188 --> 39:20.276
- <i>Let us see how the white man
likes our peyote.</i>

39:39.045 --> 39:41.464
- What'd you... What'd you do?

40:25.257 --> 40:28.302
- You've got to kill yourself
to end this, Jackson.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.806
You need to end your own life,
Jackson.

40:31.931 --> 40:33.390
- No. No.

40:33.516 --> 40:35.935
- You were supposed
to look out for me.

40:36.727 --> 40:38.771
You know,
that's what older brothers do.

40:38.896 --> 40:40.981
- No.

40:41.107 --> 40:42.942
- It's time to die.

40:48.114 --> 40:49.615
- No.

40:51.325 --> 40:53.327
- Why'd you shoot me, Jackson?

40:55.121 --> 40:57.331
Your own brother, Jackson.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.754
<i>- No!</i>

41:04.797 --> 41:07.133
No!

41:07.258 --> 41:09.593
I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to kill...

41:09.718 --> 41:12.596
I didn't mean to... No!

41:22.690 --> 41:25.985
This one <i>must go</i> now.

41:31.907 --> 41:35.035
<i>This man is your responsibility.</i>

41:35.452 --> 41:38.164
<i>You have honored your debt to him.</i>

41:41.834 --> 41:44.545
<i>Give him your horse so he leaves</i>

41:44.670 --> 41:51.218
<i>and never comes back.</i>

42:45.856 --> 42:47.566
- Thank you.

43:24.812 --> 43:27.856
May you find <i>your</i> way.

43:37.491 --> 43:40.035
- Wait.

43:58.554 --> 44:01.181
No. For... for you.

44:04.727 --> 44:07.521
Hey! Hey! Ah!

44:07.980 --> 44:10.024
Crazy man!

44:11.775 --> 44:13.944
<i>Go now!</i>

44:17.239 --> 44:18.699
Crazy man.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.243
<i>Go. Go now!</i>

44:22.536 --> 44:23.871
<i>Crazy man!</i>

44:24.455 --> 44:26.623
<i>Go now!</i>

45:35.818 --> 45:37.569
- Ah!!

45:37.694 --> 45:39.530
- Ah!

47:56.750 --> 47:58.460
- Mr. Carver?

48:01.296 --> 48:03.173
It's Jackson.

48:07.135 --> 48:09.471
You remember me?

48:10.180 --> 48:13.475
- Yes, sir...
I know who you are.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.519
Who could forget?

48:18.939 --> 48:21.942
Ah, this is my granddaughter.

48:22.067 --> 48:25.028
This is my acquaintance,
Jackson.

48:26.780 --> 48:28.407
- Hello.

48:28.532 --> 48:30.909
- Pleased to meet you.

48:31.034 --> 48:35.664
- We served in the war together.
Rebecca lives with me now.

48:35.789 --> 48:37.791
- How long's it been, huh?

48:37.916 --> 48:40.669
- Hmm. Seven years in May.

48:42.796 --> 48:45.215
- Yeah...
Yeah, that's about right.

48:47.593 --> 48:50.345
I didn't know you had a family.

48:50.470 --> 48:51.888
- Uh-huh.

48:52.014 --> 48:55.017
You look like you had
a really rough journey.

48:55.809 --> 48:56.935
What brings you to my door?

48:58.437 --> 49:00.439
- My wife. She's...

49:02.441 --> 49:04.818
She's been kidnapped.

49:05.819 --> 49:07.946
She's taken.

49:08.071 --> 49:10.240
Taken from me.

49:11.199 --> 49:15.037
- Wife?
I'm so sorry to hear that.

49:17.706 --> 49:21.335
Anything I can do
to get you back on the trail?

49:21.460 --> 49:23.253
- I could use a proper saddle.

49:24.254 --> 49:25.672
My horse.

49:25.797 --> 49:27.799
- Certainly.
I have a small shed.

49:27.924 --> 49:29.551
It's yours.

49:29.676 --> 49:33.013
Now, whatever you need.
Keep the saddle.

49:33.138 --> 49:35.182
- Thank you.

49:35.307 --> 49:37.017
- I'll meet you over there.

50:34.032 --> 50:35.992
- Grandfather, what's wrong?

50:36.118 --> 50:38.829
- He's killed more men
than you met in your lifetime.

50:38.954 --> 50:41.206
You load your gun
like I showed you,

50:41.331 --> 50:44.918
and if anything happens to me,
Rebecca, you will run from here.

50:45.544 --> 50:47.879
Do you hear me?
Do as I tell you.

50:48.004 --> 50:51.174
You will run from this man
and you do not look back.

50:52.300 --> 50:54.386
Run for your life.

50:55.303 --> 50:56.722
- Grandpa!

51:00.142 --> 51:01.810
- You run...

51:01.935 --> 51:04.730
if anything happens to me.

51:27.711 --> 51:29.588
- Uh, you have any...

51:29.713 --> 51:31.631
water for my horse?

51:32.966 --> 51:35.177
- Pond water's
not the best water.

51:35.969 --> 51:39.806
Follow me, son.
Let's walk down to the creek.

51:39.931 --> 51:42.476
So you're headed south, huh?

51:42.601 --> 51:44.603
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hmm.

51:45.979 --> 51:48.064
Saw a group of riders...

51:48.190 --> 51:51.401
passing the big trail yesterday.

51:52.986 --> 51:57.282
You know, three riders
and one woman. Mexican.

51:58.784 --> 52:01.036
- What time of day yesterday?

52:01.161 --> 52:04.748
- Late.
But the sun was still not down.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.627
- Huh.

52:09.795 --> 52:12.547
Those Mexicans you... you saw,

52:12.672 --> 52:15.509
they... they took my wife.

52:15.634 --> 52:17.969
They came in the night
and they took her.

52:18.094 --> 52:22.224
- Those are awful things
for any man to have to say.

52:22.349 --> 52:24.684
My concern is that those riders

52:24.810 --> 52:27.521
seemed peaceful enough.

52:27.646 --> 52:31.149
But they had the fear of God
in their... eyes.

52:31.274 --> 52:33.693
- Look, I'm... I'm sorry

52:33.819 --> 52:37.906
to bring stories of bloodshed
and kidnapping to your door.

52:38.031 --> 52:40.367
Those things had to be said.

52:40.492 --> 52:42.035
Those men...

52:43.245 --> 52:46.039
Those men are the worst
of their kind.

52:46.957 --> 52:50.794
- Why does it strike me
that the last time I saw you...

52:50.919 --> 52:54.172
after some of the things you did
for General Sherman,

52:54.297 --> 52:57.467
the men...
they called you Diablo?

52:59.594 --> 53:02.055
I asked the men what it meant.

53:03.056 --> 53:07.686
And when they told me...
I learned something about you.

53:07.811 --> 53:11.273
- No.
No, I was just following orders.

53:12.274 --> 53:16.528
I'm a married man
intent on landing my family.

53:16.653 --> 53:19.990
- You were eventually...
Sherman's best killer,

53:20.115 --> 53:22.159
and as I recall,

53:22.284 --> 53:25.704
you came to enjoy life
on his trail.

53:25.829 --> 53:27.748
Jackson...

53:27.873 --> 53:31.293
I have a granddaughter
in my life here.

53:33.086 --> 53:35.964
I was always kind to you,
wasn't I?

53:36.089 --> 53:38.383
- Yes.

53:38.508 --> 53:40.302
- I don't mince my words.

53:41.887 --> 53:44.014
Why did you come here?

53:44.139 --> 53:47.225
- I came to ask for your help.

53:48.310 --> 53:51.771
- After all these years,
you're still torturing yourself

53:51.897 --> 53:54.107
over accidentally shooting
your brother?

53:55.692 --> 53:57.736
Go home, son.

53:58.737 --> 54:00.906
Leave those people alone.

54:04.534 --> 54:06.328
- Oh, I understand.

54:07.329 --> 54:11.333
- I fear you haven't been well
since last I seen you.

54:13.835 --> 54:15.795
Once you fetch the water
from that stream,

54:15.921 --> 54:17.631
we'll get you a proper meal.

54:20.550 --> 54:22.427
Then you have to go.

54:22.552 --> 54:24.012
Alright?

55:01.800 --> 55:04.886
Please! You can have
anything you want,

55:05.011 --> 55:07.263
but please don't hurt us.

55:07.389 --> 55:09.432
- You gonna look at me like that?

55:09.557 --> 55:13.186
All I needed was a little bit
of fucking help from you.

55:14.729 --> 55:16.398
That's all I needed.

55:21.736 --> 55:23.405
Ah, there he is!

55:24.614 --> 55:26.658
Our intrepid trail traveler.

55:26.783 --> 55:29.619
- I just can't seem to lose you.

55:31.621 --> 55:33.415
- Well, what can I say?

55:33.540 --> 55:35.500
I've become attached.

55:35.625 --> 55:36.960
- Jackson,

55:37.085 --> 55:40.380
stop this insanity right now.

55:41.423 --> 55:44.217
- Yeah, your fight's with me.

55:44.342 --> 55:46.720
- My fight is with everybody.

55:46.845 --> 55:49.806
Lovely granddaughter
he has in there.

55:49.931 --> 55:51.599
- No.

55:51.725 --> 55:53.309
- Benjamin, how old is she?

55:53.435 --> 55:55.729
- Please, just leave
my granddaughter alone. Please.

55:55.854 --> 55:57.731
- Shhh. Shhh-shhh.

55:57.856 --> 55:59.441
- Please, Jackson.

55:59.566 --> 56:01.109
I mean you no harm.

56:01.234 --> 56:03.194
I-I-I can help you.

56:03.319 --> 56:06.031
Yeah, I... I will go with you

56:06.156 --> 56:08.992
and bring your wife back.

56:09.117 --> 56:11.453
- You had your chance.

56:14.456 --> 56:17.125
Now say your prayers.

56:23.673 --> 56:24.883
Say 'em!

56:32.265 --> 56:33.892
- For if we live...

56:34.893 --> 56:36.186
we live to the Lord.

56:36.311 --> 56:38.480
- Louder.

56:39.481 --> 56:40.899
- If We die...

56:41.900 --> 56:42.942
we die to the Lord.

56:43.068 --> 56:45.361
- Louder, goddammit!
I want to hear it!

56:45.487 --> 56:51.034
- Whether we live or we die,
we are to the Lord!

56:51.159 --> 56:53.161
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

56:54.079 --> 56:55.580
- Louder!

56:55.705 --> 56:57.582
- Hallowed... be thy name!!

56:57.707 --> 56:58.791
-Louder!!

56:58.917 --> 57:02.337
- Thy Kingdom come, thy--
- Louder, goddammit!

57:02.462 --> 57:04.047
- Give us this day
our daily bread--

57:04.172 --> 57:06.549
- You should've never
questioned me.

57:06.674 --> 57:08.635
- And forgive us
our trespasses as--

57:08.760 --> 57:11.179
- You better hope
he's listening.

1:00:44.058 --> 1:00:45.476
<i>Where is César?</i>

1:00:45.601 --> 1:00:47.020
<i>I want to leave.</i>

1:00:47.895 --> 1:00:49.439
- <i>Over there.</i>

1:00:53.943 --> 1:00:55.653
<i>- Let's go, César!</i>

1:00:56.738 --> 1:01:00.742
- <i>Relax Guillermo,
we are almost to the house!</i>

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:56.798
- Ah!

1:01:57.757 --> 1:02:00.009
Ah!! No!!

1:02:05.598 --> 1:02:07.225
No.

1:02:08.017 --> 1:02:09.477
Guillermo!

1:02:10.228 --> 1:02:11.145
<i>Stay!</i> .

1:02:11.270 --> 1:02:13.439
- Guillermo!
- Alexsandra!

1:02:13.564 --> 1:02:15.858
<i>- Ah!
- No tengas miedo! Vamos!</i>

1:02:17.777 --> 1:02:19.404
- Guillermo!

1:02:43.845 --> 1:02:45.596
- César! No!

1:02:48.558 --> 1:02:50.351
- No! No!

1:02:51.686 --> 1:02:54.147
<i>He Will kill us all.</i>

1:03:00.570 --> 1:03:01.696
<i>Let's go!</i>

1:03:02.196 --> 1:03:04.615
<i>We have to get her to safety!</i>

1:04:03.674 --> 1:04:05.634
<i>Listen! Listen!</i>

1:04:06.177 --> 1:04:08.471
<i>Get the children!</i>

1:04:09.555 --> 1:04:11.474
<i>Get into the house!</i>

1:04:11.599 --> 1:04:13.309
<i>Fast! Fast! Fast!</i>

1:06:37.870 --> 1:06:40.081
- Alexsandra!

1:07:01.686 --> 1:07:02.896
Where is she?

1:07:10.319 --> 1:07:11.904
Bring her to me!

1:07:14.323 --> 1:07:16.909
Or I'll kill every last one of you.

1:07:20.871 --> 1:07:22.122
- Uh!

1:07:23.916 --> 1:07:26.627
<i>Ah!</i>

1:07:26.752 --> 1:07:28.337
- Ah!

1:07:52.611 --> 1:07:54.571
Mama!

1:07:58.367 --> 1:08:00.911
- Ah!

1:08:05.458 --> 1:08:06.751
- Ah!

1:08:25.519 --> 1:08:27.396
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1:08:39.450 --> 1:08:42.369
<i>My sister will never be with you.</i>

1:08:54.215 --> 1:08:57.218
- That might just be a favour to you.

1:09:03.933 --> 1:09:05.935
Take it.

1:09:17.655 --> 1:09:19.365
Hmm. Yes, sir.

1:09:26.121 --> 1:09:28.916
We don't wanna rush this...

1:09:29.041 --> 1:09:30.751
do we?

1:09:32.837 --> 1:09:34.964
Shhh-shhh-shhh-shhh.

1:09:36.924 --> 1:09:38.217
- Argh!

1:12:19.586 --> 1:12:20.629
- Oh!

1:12:24.008 --> 1:12:25.676
<i>- Ah!</i>

1:13:09.344 --> 1:13:11.055
- Ah!!!

1:13:55.182 --> 1:13:57.101
- Alexsandra.

1:14:00.145 --> 1:14:01.730
- Alexsandra!

1:14:02.731 --> 1:14:04.108
Alexsandra!

1:14:06.944 --> 1:14:09.696
- Why have you done this?
Guillermo's my husband.

1:14:10.531 --> 1:14:12.533
<i>Come out and face me!</i>

1:14:12.866 --> 1:14:15.452
- What you wanted was a fantasy.

1:14:15.577 --> 1:14:18.539
How many other women
have you done this to?

1:14:20.958 --> 1:14:22.334
- Alexsandra!

1:14:27.548 --> 1:14:29.842
- You left me no choice.

1:14:32.261 --> 1:14:33.554
I...

1:14:34.138 --> 1:14:35.764
I had to have you.

1:15:03.834 --> 1:15:06.587
<i>- If you touch her, I will kill you!</i>

1:15:09.173 --> 1:15:11.383
- You poor man.

1:15:43.415 --> 1:15:46.210
- No! No! Alexsandra!

1:15:52.216 --> 1:15:53.884
<i>I am going to kill you!</i>

1:15:54.009 --> 1:15:56.678
- Get out of my house.

1:15:58.430 --> 1:16:00.641
Go! Go!

1:16:19.868 --> 1:16:22.079
No! No! No, please!

1:16:23.664 --> 1:16:26.375
No, don't! No!

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:29.670
Stop! Stop it! No!

1:16:29.795 --> 1:16:31.296
No.

1:16:32.464 --> 1:16:35.300
Please,
he's the father of my children!

1:16:35.425 --> 1:16:38.262
Please don't! Guillermo!

1:16:38.387 --> 1:16:40.472
- Alexsandra.

1:16:54.528 --> 1:16:58.449
<i>I am not afraid.</i> <i>I am not afraid.</i>

1:17:02.202 --> 1:17:04.037
<i>Don't do it.</i>

1:17:07.708 --> 1:17:09.501
<i>We can stop.</i>

1:17:10.919 --> 1:17:13.130
<i>There does not need to be any more death.</i>

1:17:18.510 --> 1:17:20.178
No! No!
