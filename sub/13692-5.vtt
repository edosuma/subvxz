WEBVTT

00:08.225 --> 00:09.893
So, what do you think?

00:09.977 --> 00:12.854
All this time and I never knew
there were three
G's in Glenbogle.

00:12.938 --> 00:14.021
What?

00:14.106 --> 00:15.732
Like the three R's in stirrer?

00:15.816 --> 00:19.403
All right, all right,
let's try to keep this
constructive, shall we?

00:19.486 --> 00:21.863
Now, what we're after
is blanket coverage,

00:21.947 --> 00:24.241
which means plastering
these all over the glen.

00:24.324 --> 00:27.119
Invasion of the oiks,
that's what it means.

00:27.202 --> 00:28.704
But we haven't
got much time so

00:28.787 --> 00:30.247
it's gonna be hard work.
Between us, though...

00:30.330 --> 00:32.540
Hands full, catering.

00:32.624 --> 00:36.003
I've already promised
Golly that I'd be about.

00:37.587 --> 00:39.464
Right.
So it's just us two, then.

00:39.548 --> 00:44.094
Sorry, I've got this morning's
post to sort through.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.764
I should put it down, dear,
before you do
yourself an injury.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.683
What's all this?

00:49.766 --> 00:51.518
Oh,
do say you like it, Archie.

00:51.602 --> 00:54.146
It's our
contribution to the big day.

00:54.229 --> 00:57.983
We thought we'd call it
"The Dungeon Experience."

00:58.066 --> 01:00.485
The visitors
could come down here,

01:00.569 --> 01:03.697
then we could give them
a turn in the manacles,

01:03.780 --> 01:08.493
and then tell
them terrible tales
of incarceration and despair.

01:08.577 --> 01:10.120
All for a modest fee,
of course.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.747
Mother, it's brilliant.

01:11.830 --> 01:15.000
Oh, thank you.
Of course,
I can't take all the credit.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.377
Your father did
some of the work.
Least he could do,

01:17.461 --> 01:19.755
considering it was his fault
the bridge collapsed
in the first place.

01:19.838 --> 01:21.089
It wasn't my fault.

01:21.173 --> 01:23.508
Hector, please.
Anyway, onwards and upwards.

01:23.592 --> 01:25.594
There's a lot of research
to do yet if I'm going to

01:25.677 --> 01:27.596
get this notice
board filled out in time.

01:27.679 --> 01:32.142
Here, Archie.
Try these manacles on.
They're great fun.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.061
You don't think
you're gonna find anyone

01:34.144 --> 01:36.647
daft enough to put
those things on, do you?

01:40.692 --> 01:43.445
Ah! Duncan.

02:31.827 --> 02:34.746
Well,
at least we know they work.

02:34.830 --> 02:36.707
Not if we can't
unlock them, they don't.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.958
It's just a bit stiff,
that's all.

02:39.042 --> 02:40.210
Careful, you'll bend it.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.670
All right, don't panic!

02:41.753 --> 02:42.921
You know what we need,
don't you?

02:43.005 --> 02:44.464
Help?

02:44.548 --> 02:47.467
Lubricating oil.
Stay right where you are.

03:03.567 --> 03:05.193
(COUGHING)

03:05.986 --> 03:07.529
(LAUGHING)

03:07.613 --> 03:09.364
You look
dazzling this morning.

03:09.448 --> 03:11.450
I like to make
an effort for my man.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.995
STUART: Come here. Mmm.

03:15.078 --> 03:17.497
So when are you gonna lift me
out of this life of drudgery?

03:17.581 --> 03:19.416
Maybe sooner than you think.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.335
Oh, aye? Tell me more.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.630
Just stick with me, Cinders.
I'll make you
Queen of the Highlands.

03:24.713 --> 03:27.758
Well, after what
happened to the last one,
I think I'll pass.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.889
Not interrupting anything,
am I?

03:33.972 --> 03:35.766
No, we were just
talking about people

03:35.849 --> 03:37.559
getting their
heads chopped off.

03:37.643 --> 03:39.435
A tradition I'm
personally all for reviving.

03:39.519 --> 03:42.563
Like the one about
a fair day's work
for a fair day's pay?

03:42.648 --> 03:45.442
Oh, getting a pay rise, am I?

03:45.525 --> 03:47.861
I was expecting you
a quarter of an hour ago.

03:47.945 --> 03:50.822
Whatever you want,
it had better be good.
I've got a lot on today.

03:50.905 --> 03:55.410
Oh, it's, er, much
better than good. After you.

04:11.134 --> 04:12.761
Mr MacDonald.

04:12.844 --> 04:15.097
Ah, Councillor Ayling.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.266
So the big day dawns, eh?

04:17.349 --> 04:19.810
Yeah, I hope you'll be along.
It should be quite an event.

04:19.892 --> 04:23.689
Oh, I wouldn't
miss it for the world.
I'm impressed.

04:23.772 --> 04:24.898
You've done very well.

04:24.982 --> 04:26.149
Oh, thank you.

04:26.232 --> 04:29.194
Pass my congratulations
on to Mr McIntosh, too.

04:29.278 --> 04:31.029
Yeah, he's done
a great job of that bridge.

04:31.113 --> 04:32.823
Aye, and there's more to come.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.742
We're right behind
him with the plans
for the development.

04:35.826 --> 04:36.910
What development?

04:36.994 --> 04:38.412
Boglecroft.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.997
Boglecroft?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.456
It's got a ring to it,
don't you think?

04:42.499 --> 04:43.959
Let me get this straight.

04:44.042 --> 04:47.129
You want to buy that mountain,
Ben Bogle,

04:47.212 --> 04:50.173
and turn it into some
sort of holiday resort.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.676
You got it in one.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.304
If you want my advice,
I'd stick to what you know.

04:55.387 --> 04:58.265
I'm not planning on
being a building supplier
all my life.

04:58.348 --> 05:02.769
And this...
This just can't fail.

05:02.853 --> 05:04.646
The estate gets
a big lump of cash,

05:04.730 --> 05:06.607
which I make
back in timeshare.

05:06.690 --> 05:10.569
And you earn brownie
points off the bank.
Everybody's happy.

05:13.447 --> 05:16.408
Say I was interested,
what sort of figures
are we talking about?

05:16.491 --> 05:19.453
I could certainly offer...

05:19.536 --> 05:21.246
two hundred thousand.

05:21.330 --> 05:24.666
Two hundred and fifty
and we might be in
the same ballpark.

05:27.419 --> 05:29.129
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

05:37.679 --> 05:39.848
Looking for
anything in particular?

05:39.932 --> 05:41.975
Oh, er, no, no, no.

05:42.059 --> 05:43.810
Just, er, looking around.

05:43.894 --> 05:45.562
Mmm-hmm.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.729
What are these for?

05:46.813 --> 05:48.357
Castrating bull calves.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.693
What's your problem?

05:51.777 --> 05:53.654
There's no... No problem.
There's no problem.

05:53.737 --> 05:56.198
It's just a, um...
A slight mechanical hitch

05:56.281 --> 05:57.616
in the dungeons.
Nothing to worry about.

05:57.699 --> 05:59.910
Lubricates the parts
other oils can't reach.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.455
Well, it's a little more
serious than rusty steel.

06:03.538 --> 06:05.040
(STAMMERING) Quite frankly,
Golly, I...

06:05.123 --> 06:07.209
What I need is some
kind of a hacksaw.

06:07.292 --> 06:11.463
Hacksaw? There you go.

06:11.546 --> 06:15.634
Tungsten carbide.
Cuts like a hot
knife through butter.

06:15.717 --> 06:20.222
Hot kni...
Hot knife. All right.
That's, er, just the ticket.

06:23.558 --> 06:25.102
Watch yourself.

06:27.646 --> 06:30.315
Oh. Sorry.

06:30.399 --> 06:32.526
-Good book, is it?
-Ripping read.

06:32.609 --> 06:36.280
The story of Ian McIntosh,
the dashing
birdman of Glenbogle.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.532
Mmm. I think I'll
wait to see the film.

06:38.615 --> 06:42.661
You know, he was
the only man ever to escape
from our impregnable dungeon.

06:42.744 --> 06:43.912
When was it?

06:43.996 --> 06:45.664
1493.

06:45.747 --> 06:49.126
Shame, I'd like to have
asked him how he did it.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.004
You know, this would
make the perfect tale
for my notice board.

06:52.087 --> 06:56.174
The problem is, it's
a complete mystery. Listen.

06:56.258 --> 06:58.510
The day of his escape,
McIntosh

06:58.594 --> 07:00.804
and a small band of
accomplices were discovered

07:00.887 --> 07:05.434
by the MacDonald search party
somewhere in
the Glenbogle hills.

07:05.517 --> 07:10.480
The Battle of Park
nan Troor Kyle-Yach
was swift and brutal.

07:10.564 --> 07:14.568
McIntosh fought valiantly,
but he was weak
from starvation

07:14.651 --> 07:17.446
and he was cut down
on the bloody field.

07:17.529 --> 07:23.493
The secret of his
escape died with him.
Stirring stuff, isn't it?

07:23.577 --> 07:26.496
Mmm. I prefer a good
Jackie Collins myself.

07:28.624 --> 07:31.418
Obviously this is only
an artist's
impression of the complex.

07:31.501 --> 07:34.796
But it's pretty much
how I see Boglecroft.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.507
And these are
profit projections
for the first five years,

07:37.591 --> 07:42.012
based on a ten-percent
increase in occupancy
over each 12-month period.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.847
I'm impressed.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.433
And I also have
outline planning permission
from the council.

07:46.516 --> 07:51.355
If you can deliver
on these promises,
we might just have a deal.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.566
Excellent. An historic moment.

07:54.650 --> 07:57.611
A McIntosh makes
a killing on MacDonald land.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.030
We can't do anything
without talking to Archie.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.824
He can't put
the kibosh on it, can he?

08:02.908 --> 08:04.451
You call the shots, right?

08:04.534 --> 08:06.912
I have to consult
with him out of courtesy.

08:06.995 --> 08:12.167
But while
the bank's in charge,
yes, I call the shots.

08:13.751 --> 08:15.379
(HONKING)

08:17.506 --> 08:20.092
Steady on.
You nearly ran me down.

08:20.175 --> 08:22.594
I know who I'd
like to run down.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.017
What were you planning to do?

08:29.101 --> 08:30.811
Build some sort of
Legoland for adults

08:30.894 --> 08:32.604
on my mountain
without us noticing?

08:32.688 --> 08:34.231
It's not as bad as it sounds.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.691
So you're in on
this as well, are you?

08:35.774 --> 08:36.817
And when were
you gonna tell me?

08:36.900 --> 08:37.943
I've only just found out.

08:38.025 --> 08:39.111
At least hear
what he's got to say.

08:39.193 --> 08:40.236
Go on.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.989
I'm talking
a massive investment.

08:42.072 --> 08:43.740
That means local
jobs and wealth.

08:43.823 --> 08:44.950
Yeah, for you, no doubt.

08:45.033 --> 08:46.368
For everyone.

08:46.451 --> 08:48.203
People are falling
over themselves to get out

08:48.287 --> 08:50.163
the towns and
breathe some fresh air.

08:50.247 --> 08:53.124
But what they don't
want is the inconvenience
of the country.

08:53.208 --> 08:55.459
So we give them a shop,
a swimming pool,

08:55.544 --> 08:57.671
restaurants,
entertainment in the evenings.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.548
But we give it to
them on Ben Bogle.

08:59.630 --> 09:01.300
That way they get
the best of both worlds.

09:01.383 --> 09:03.010
It's got pound signs
written all over it.

09:03.093 --> 09:04.636
It's got tacky
written all over it.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.557
It might go down well
on the Costa del Sol,
but not here!

09:08.640 --> 09:10.809
Well said, Archie.
Sell a McIntosh

09:10.892 --> 09:12.686
MacDonald land?
Over my dead body!

09:12.769 --> 09:15.355
I'll put that in
the contract if you like.

09:15.439 --> 09:18.859
Oh, come on,
think how it would
boost your visiting figures.

09:18.942 --> 09:20.819
All those people
right on your doorstep.

09:20.902 --> 09:22.321
On my mountain, you mean.

09:22.404 --> 09:24.615
It'd be my mountain, though,
that's the whole point.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.159
However desperate we get,
splitting up the estate

09:27.242 --> 09:29.578
is the one thing that
I do not intend to do.

09:29.661 --> 09:31.622
You'd pay off
half of your debt.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.665
We could've sold
land any time we wanted.

09:33.749 --> 09:36.335
It's exactly what
I've spent two years
trying to avoid.

09:36.418 --> 09:38.128
It's a good offer, Archie.

09:38.211 --> 09:41.381
Yeah,
and one that I will fight
every step of the way.

09:41.465 --> 09:43.133
ARCHIE:
Starting with the council.

09:43.967 --> 09:45.594
With me at his side.

09:50.682 --> 09:54.895
I need a really
punchy title for my tale.

09:56.355 --> 10:00.442
How about The Dashing Birdman?

10:00.525 --> 10:03.654
Or The Tartan Pimpernel?

10:03.737 --> 10:06.698
Yes, very good, Lexie.

10:06.782 --> 10:10.702
The problem is I
cannot fathom out
how he escaped.

10:10.786 --> 10:12.245
Well, if you're
thinking about giving up,

10:12.329 --> 10:13.914
I could really
use a hand here.

10:13.997 --> 10:16.124
I know, I'll work backwards!

10:16.208 --> 10:19.836
If I can figure out
where he was discovered,

10:19.920 --> 10:24.716
then I can find
out how he escaped.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.011
What do you think, Lexie? Mmm?

10:29.471 --> 10:31.348
-Lexie?
-Mmm?

10:31.431 --> 10:35.477
Oh, Lexie. You're not
getting fond of Stuart,
are you?

10:35.560 --> 10:37.938
I like him.

10:38.021 --> 10:39.982
Think carefully
before you ally yourself

10:40.065 --> 10:41.942
to a McIntosh.
They can be a bad bet.

10:42.025 --> 10:46.113
I'm a serf.
I don't go in for alliances.

10:46.196 --> 10:49.574
Well, this is a relationship,
and he treats me really well.

10:49.658 --> 10:51.451
At least he doesn't
think I'm a skivvy.

10:51.535 --> 10:54.788
Lexie, I have never
thought of you as a skivvy.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.624
Yeah, I know.
But that's what I am.

10:57.708 --> 11:00.585
And that's what I always
will be if I stay here.

11:13.515 --> 11:15.517
Wouldn't you be more
comfortable in the car?

11:15.601 --> 11:18.520
(CHUCKLING) You may
be the laird, my boy,

11:18.604 --> 11:21.648
but I think you will find
that when it comes to
dealing with officialdom,

11:21.732 --> 11:23.942
the name Hector
Naismith MacDonald

11:24.026 --> 11:26.153
still carries
the greatest weight.

11:26.236 --> 11:27.779
ARCHIE: There he is.

11:27.863 --> 11:30.699
Yes, marvellous fellow.
Played 19 holes
with him the other day.

11:30.782 --> 11:33.827
This is going to be
easier than I thought.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.996
Peter, dear boy. How are you?

11:36.079 --> 11:38.373
(HECTOR CHUCKLING)

11:38.457 --> 11:40.000
Um, a word in your ear.
There is a rather

11:40.083 --> 11:42.210
delicate matter I'd
like to discuss with you.

11:44.296 --> 11:47.466
Ah, boys,
are we drinking to success?

11:47.549 --> 11:49.301
ARCHIE: Not quite.

11:49.384 --> 11:51.094
Was
the councillor not responsive?

11:51.178 --> 11:53.221
Yes, he was until
father referred to him as

11:53.305 --> 11:56.350
"a jumped-up dictator
from the wrong
side of the tracks."

11:56.433 --> 11:57.935
Oh, dear. Was it that bad?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.686
Worse.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.563
The council are
backing Boglecroft
a hundred percent.

12:01.647 --> 12:03.065
-Traitors.
-Quite.

12:03.148 --> 12:06.360
So, any official
lines of objection
are effectively blocked.

12:06.443 --> 12:08.528
And if they
weren't beforehand,
they certainly are now.

12:08.612 --> 12:11.281
Have you actually
looked at this plan
of Stuart's properly?

12:11.365 --> 12:13.951
Or are you just
getting a sweat up
because it was his idea?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.535
It's an intrusion.

12:15.619 --> 12:17.454
They'll be all
over us like ants.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.456
Oh, well, it's all right
when it suits you though,
isn't it?

12:19.539 --> 12:22.209
You can't wait to
relieve people of their cash.

12:22.292 --> 12:24.711
It's not quite
the same thing, Lexie.

12:24.795 --> 12:27.881
All he is guilty of
is trying to make
something of himself.

12:27.965 --> 12:30.217
Ben Bogle is
the reserve of the MacDonalds.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.052
Always has been,
always will be!

12:32.135 --> 12:34.388
Well, maybe it's about time
that the rest of
us had a turn, eh?

12:34.471 --> 12:38.225
People that weren't born
with a mouthful
of silver spoons.

12:39.810 --> 12:41.770
(DOOR BANGING SHUT)

12:43.063 --> 12:45.691
Now, the time has
come for direct action.

12:45.774 --> 12:47.818
I'm not sure
that Archie would...

12:47.901 --> 12:50.279
Golly, the boy needs our help.
He means well

12:50.362 --> 12:52.656
but he's got no
experience in the field.

12:52.739 --> 12:56.243
This is a problem
that requires two minds
and a single malt.

12:56.326 --> 12:57.536
Er, sorry, Molly, men's talk.

12:57.619 --> 12:58.829
Quite so.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.249
Now, Golly,
Park nan Troor Kyle-Yach.

13:02.332 --> 13:04.626
Have you any idea
what it might mean?

13:04.710 --> 13:07.421
Yeah, it's the Gaelic
for the Field of
the Three Hags.

13:07.504 --> 13:08.672
Which is where?

13:08.755 --> 13:11.091
Well, it's obviously
a landmark of some kind.

13:11.174 --> 13:13.760
Er, the three Scots
pines up on the high track.

13:13.844 --> 13:15.971
Or those caves at
the far end of the loch.

13:16.054 --> 13:18.932
Why don't you
consult family records?

13:19.016 --> 13:21.518
Brilliant.
You see, Hector, despite what

13:21.602 --> 13:24.813
people might say, you're
not just a pretty face.

13:24.896 --> 13:25.981
What do you wanna
know for anyway?

13:26.064 --> 13:27.149
Dungeon tour.

13:27.232 --> 13:28.525
I think people
are going to find

13:28.609 --> 13:30.485
a lot more down
there than they expected.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.783
-Have you been here all day?
-Aye.

13:36.867 --> 13:38.827
I thought I was gonna be
here all night and all.

13:38.910 --> 13:41.079
Well,
keep a sense of proportion,
for heaven's sake.

13:41.163 --> 13:44.791
In the grand scheme of things,
it's merely
a tiny blip in time.

13:44.875 --> 13:48.712
A blip? It may just be
a tiny blip in time to you.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.464
My whole day's in a guddle.

13:50.547 --> 13:52.174
A guddle? Where are you going?

13:52.257 --> 13:55.177
Glenbogle is under threat.
We need to make plans.

13:55.260 --> 13:58.013
Ah, well, I'm away.

13:58.096 --> 14:00.766
I've had nothing
to eat all day.

14:00.849 --> 14:03.060
That's desertion in my book.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.145
Never in the field
of human conflict

14:05.228 --> 14:08.398
was so much owed by
so many to so few.

14:08.482 --> 14:09.566
Eh, Golly?

14:09.650 --> 14:10.817
Absolutely, boss.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.822
I need you to cast
an eye over these letters.

14:15.906 --> 14:18.241
Don't tell me.
The MOD want to compulsory

14:18.325 --> 14:20.535
purchase and turn us
into a submarine base?

14:20.619 --> 14:25.248
Please, Archie,
we have got to work together.

14:25.332 --> 14:30.420
All of these are
requests for patronage
from local organisations.

14:30.504 --> 14:32.256
The Women's
Institute want to hold

14:32.339 --> 14:33.966
their annual
garden party here.

14:34.049 --> 14:38.095
Then there's the church fete,
the school sports day.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.264
Well,
we try to help where we can.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.432
Yes, I know, but
the hospitality bill alone

14:42.516 --> 14:44.518
would come to
a couple of grand.

14:44.601 --> 14:46.812
It's out of the question
at the moment, I'm afraid.

14:46.895 --> 14:49.773
And I thought
a "no" might be better
coming from you.

14:50.941 --> 14:52.776
Okay, leave them here.

15:01.410 --> 15:04.329
You know,
we wouldn't have this problem

15:04.413 --> 15:06.873
if you would just
consider Stuart's offer.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.252
Forget it.

15:10.335 --> 15:13.922
If I give in to this,
pretty soon there'll be
nothing left to fight for.

15:14.006 --> 15:18.135
It's only a mountain, Archie.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.972
I grew up on that mountain.
Selling it would be
like chopping an arm off.

15:22.055 --> 15:25.350
But it's an easy way
to clear half your debt.

15:25.434 --> 15:27.519
And halve the estate.

15:27.603 --> 15:28.895
Because I know
what would happen.

15:28.979 --> 15:30.188
Next year,
when things are tight,

15:30.272 --> 15:31.565
we'd sell a little
bit more land and

15:31.648 --> 15:33.233
then the next year it
would be the same thing.

15:33.317 --> 15:35.652
Would that be so bad
if it gets
the bank off your back?

15:35.736 --> 15:38.322
And where would it end?
A campsite in
the vegetable garden?

15:38.405 --> 15:41.867
Crazy golf around
my brother's grave?

15:41.950 --> 15:44.411
I will make this place pay,
but I do not intend to

15:44.494 --> 15:46.663
turn it into a theme
park in the process.

15:46.747 --> 15:47.831
I thought you understood that.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.833
I do understand.

15:49.916 --> 15:53.503
But Boglecroft
could be a real lifeline
for this place.

15:57.174 --> 16:00.260
Which is why I've
recommended it to the bank.

16:04.348 --> 16:07.559
They're all for the idea.

16:07.643 --> 16:12.814
I want to make an announcement
at the grand opening and
I'd like you by my side.

16:17.653 --> 16:20.614
Information is power.
Knowledge is the key.

16:20.697 --> 16:23.116
Ah.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.910
Surveillance, Hector.

16:24.993 --> 16:26.745
Keep a check on
McIntosh's moves

16:26.828 --> 16:29.456
and then we head
him off at the pass.

16:29.539 --> 16:34.544
Thank heavens
I've got you, Golly.
Stand by your man.

16:36.171 --> 16:37.297
Who was it who said that?

16:37.381 --> 16:38.715
Tammy Wynette.

16:38.799 --> 16:39.800
Ah.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.892
What do you want?

16:48.976 --> 16:50.727
A warmer
welcome would be nice.

16:50.811 --> 16:52.271
Have we had a row
I don't know about?

16:52.354 --> 16:54.940
You could have filled
me in on your plans.

16:55.023 --> 16:58.819
Look, if I'd said
something to you first,
would you have told Archie?

16:58.902 --> 17:03.031
No. Well, yeah. I don't know.

17:03.115 --> 17:04.992
Exactly.

17:05.075 --> 17:09.954
I'd have put you in
an impossible situation.
That's the last thing I want.

17:10.038 --> 17:15.002
I'm not gonna ask you
to choose sides, Lex,
'cause you might not pick me.

17:15.085 --> 17:18.255
And I'd rather have half
of you than nothing at all.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.675
There is one decision
you're gonna
have to make soon.

17:21.758 --> 17:23.175
What's that?

17:23.260 --> 17:25.220
Where you're
gonna let me take you
tomorrow evening.

17:25.304 --> 17:26.847
Meal or movie?

17:26.930 --> 17:28.348
And why not both?

17:28.432 --> 17:34.271
Mmm, could do.
But you'd have to be
very nice to me tonight.

17:34.354 --> 17:39.568
Look, sorry, I don't feel
like doing nice just now.
You don't mind, do you?

17:39.651 --> 17:41.737
Course not.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.530
(DOG GROWLING)

17:52.247 --> 17:53.832
Do you ever take a break?

17:53.915 --> 17:55.417
There's a lot to get through.

17:55.499 --> 17:58.253
It so happens I've got
a spare evening tonight.

17:58.337 --> 18:00.839
You know what they say
about all work and no play.

18:00.923 --> 18:03.258
You could do with
letting your hair down a bit.

18:03.341 --> 18:06.053
Is that right? Got
anything particular in mind?

18:06.136 --> 18:09.014
I'm sure together
we could come up
with something.

18:09.096 --> 18:10.891
Well, I'd better tell
you that my dancing days

18:10.974 --> 18:13.894
are over and I'm not
much of a Scrabble player.

18:13.977 --> 18:18.023
Well, we could go for
a meal or maybe a movie.

18:18.106 --> 18:21.234
Then a drink at my hotel.
We relax a little...

18:21.318 --> 18:24.029
Thanks, I think I'm
getting the picture,

18:24.112 --> 18:27.366
but, sorry, I've got
a date with a VAT return.

18:27.449 --> 18:28.825
Shame.

18:28.909 --> 18:31.787
But, hey,
can't blame a guy for trying.

18:32.955 --> 18:34.206
Good night.

18:48.470 --> 18:51.807
The quarry is in view, Hector.
Set your sights for the kill.

18:53.350 --> 18:54.393
Hector.

18:55.686 --> 18:57.980
The hind is in the field.

18:58.063 --> 19:01.775
Damn it, man, Stuart's here.
Are you getting me, Hector?

19:01.858 --> 19:03.443
Hector?

19:03.527 --> 19:04.987
(STATIC ON RADIO)

19:05.070 --> 19:06.530
Are you getting me, Hector?

19:06.613 --> 19:07.906
Mine, I think.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.784
Dunc,
we need brushes and paste.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.160
We're gonna do
some fly posting.

19:12.244 --> 19:14.413
Oh, sorry, Arch.
I've already
promised to help Lexie.

19:14.496 --> 19:16.373
Okay, you can do the pasting.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.874
I'm your man.

19:21.295 --> 19:22.754
GOLLY: Hector!

19:26.717 --> 19:29.428
Archie MacDonald,
I'm impressed.

19:29.511 --> 19:32.431
We don't usually
see your sleepy face
till 10:00 at the earliest.

19:32.514 --> 19:34.474
Yeah, I thought I'd take
a leaf out of your book.

19:34.558 --> 19:36.435
You know what they say
about the early bird.

19:36.518 --> 19:38.228
Which makes me the worm,
I suppose.

19:38.312 --> 19:39.771
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

19:39.855 --> 19:42.608
If we could just pretend
to be adults for a second,

19:42.691 --> 19:45.527
I wanted to talk to you
about the grand opening.

19:45.611 --> 19:47.154
I thought we could
do something special

19:47.237 --> 19:48.739
to officially
launch Boglecroft.

19:48.822 --> 19:52.534
Something like, um,
a sod-turning ceremony or...

19:54.828 --> 19:57.414
"Save Ben Bogle.
Register your protest."

19:57.497 --> 20:01.251
I said I'd fight you
all the way, Stella,
and I meant it.

20:24.608 --> 20:27.861
You'd better look at this.

20:27.945 --> 20:32.449
Local opposition has
a habit of snowballing.
I've seen it before.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.327
So who's gonna turn up?
A few pensioners
and sheep farmers?

20:35.410 --> 20:36.787
We've already got
the council behind us.

20:36.870 --> 20:38.705
But the family are well liked.

20:38.789 --> 20:42.542
Ach, trust me.
The momentum behind
Boglecroft is unstoppable.

20:44.336 --> 20:46.421
Of course,
we could sink Archie's boat

20:46.505 --> 20:48.048
before
the meeting even starts.

20:48.131 --> 20:49.383
How?

20:52.052 --> 20:54.221
With these.

20:54.304 --> 20:56.848
If everybody knew he
was withdrawing support
from worthy causes,

20:56.932 --> 20:59.351
how popular
would he be then, eh?

20:59.434 --> 21:00.894
One phone call to the local
rag's all it would take.

21:00.978 --> 21:02.938
No.

21:03.021 --> 21:07.067
We do this fair and square.
I won't risk sullying
Lascelles' good name.

21:07.150 --> 21:09.152
-It's business.
-It's underhand.

21:09.236 --> 21:13.156
The MacDonalds
wouldn't stoop to such tactics
and neither will I.

21:20.205 --> 21:24.960
Let me guess. George Smiley?
Or a geriatric James Bond?

21:25.043 --> 21:26.670
Actually, I was
looking for my dog, Monty.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.297
He ran off.
I can't find him anywhere.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.464
Monty? Monty!

21:29.548 --> 21:31.592
Well, you won't find
him through my keyhole.

21:31.675 --> 21:33.594
GOLLY OVER RADIO:
How are you
getting on, Hector?

21:33.677 --> 21:35.554
Any idea what that
dunderhead Stuart is up to?

21:35.637 --> 21:37.431
Well,
if we see your wee doggy,

21:37.514 --> 21:39.433
we'll tell him
to radio in, eh?

21:44.771 --> 21:46.481
HECTOR: Oh.

21:46.565 --> 21:48.191
I thought you'd
gone to ground.

21:48.275 --> 21:49.860
Oh, on the contrary.

21:49.943 --> 21:53.071
I've been on the case
and the gloves are
very definitely off.

21:53.155 --> 21:55.574
So it's a bare-knuckle fight
McIntosh is after, is it?

21:55.657 --> 21:59.036
Absolutely.
And Archie's rally is set
for the knockout punch.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.787
Well, the boy's in town.
I'll go and warn him.

22:00.871 --> 22:02.497
No, that's what they expect.

22:02.581 --> 22:04.499
I've got a better idea.

22:04.583 --> 22:07.753
No wonder they
reformed the House of Lords
if they're all like Hector.

22:07.836 --> 22:12.716
Er, he's a Highland
laird and he's my boss.
So just watch what you say.

22:12.799 --> 22:16.553
It must take years of
inbreeding to produce
a brush as daft as him.

22:16.637 --> 22:20.933
Anyway, the old goat
can do what he likes.
He's not gonna stop me.

22:21.016 --> 22:24.895
Are you referring to
my husband, Mr McIntosh?

22:24.978 --> 22:27.689
How dare you denigrate
him while under his roof?

22:27.773 --> 22:32.194
The old goat, as you call him,
has extended his hospitality.

22:32.277 --> 22:34.821
See that you respect it.
Lexie.

22:34.905 --> 22:35.989
Yes?

22:36.073 --> 22:37.950
Have you seen
the family Bible?

22:38.033 --> 22:40.827
Um, it's in the estate
office propping up the desk.

22:40.911 --> 22:43.664
Oh, thank you. It has
our family lineage in it.

22:43.747 --> 22:47.876
MacDonalds through the ages,
warriors, sages, poets.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.963
They've not been
vanquished in the past,
Mr McIntosh,

22:51.046 --> 22:53.173
and I believe they'll
not be vanquished today.

22:53.257 --> 22:55.300
Excuse me,
I have a Bible to find.

22:56.802 --> 22:58.804
I'll just hoover up
your mess, shall I?

22:58.887 --> 23:00.889
Touche.

23:00.973 --> 23:04.643
Oh, look, I meant to say,
I can't make it later.
Don't mind, do you?

23:04.726 --> 23:06.812
(VACUUM CLEANER STARTS)

23:08.897 --> 23:10.274
(GRUNTING)

23:15.946 --> 23:17.614
I'm not even going to ask.

23:26.999 --> 23:28.458
Don't tell me.

23:28.542 --> 23:29.960
What?

23:30.043 --> 23:32.004
Colonel Mustard
with the lead piping

23:32.087 --> 23:35.591
in the billiard room.
What have you got here?

23:35.674 --> 23:39.928
The contents of this trunk
are of no interest to someone

23:40.012 --> 23:44.349
who cannot even comprehend
the word "heritage".

23:44.433 --> 23:48.687
Oh, it's not the lost treasure
of the MacDonalds, is it?

23:48.770 --> 23:53.650
Not quite. But there...
There are one or two
family valuables in there.

23:53.734 --> 23:55.694
I thought all
the best stuff had gone.

23:55.777 --> 23:59.323
The well has not
altogether dried up.

23:59.406 --> 24:00.574
So what are you doing with it?

24:00.657 --> 24:01.700
Hiding it.

24:03.452 --> 24:05.621
(WHISPERING) Hiding it.

24:05.704 --> 24:08.415
The moment they open
this estate to the public,

24:08.498 --> 24:12.669
there'll be all sorts
of unsavoury characters
wandering all over the place.

24:12.753 --> 24:14.171
You can't move it by yourself.

24:14.254 --> 24:16.214
Well, slowly,
slowly, catchy monkey.

24:16.298 --> 24:17.925
Here, I'll give you a hand.

24:18.008 --> 24:19.593
Well, only if you're sure.

24:19.676 --> 24:22.387
(HECTOR GROANING) Oh, dear.
Up a bit. To me.

24:23.096 --> 24:24.264
Steady.

24:25.515 --> 24:26.892
Over there.

24:30.562 --> 24:31.647
That's quite a weight.

24:31.730 --> 24:33.774
Aye, it's full of
trinkets and baubles.

24:33.857 --> 24:35.651
One or two dear little pieces.

24:35.734 --> 24:37.903
Maybe I could,
er, have a look?

24:37.986 --> 24:39.821
Oh, I don't think so.

24:39.905 --> 24:41.782
-Oh, who's to know?
-Well...

24:42.616 --> 24:43.992
True.

24:46.161 --> 24:47.579
There you are.

25:00.550 --> 25:03.804
(HECTOR CHUCKLING)
Candy from a baby.

25:09.977 --> 25:13.021
Excuse me, Stella, could
you pass me that ledger?

25:26.326 --> 25:28.704
Lovely. Expecting someone?

25:28.787 --> 25:31.081
Stuart. He's late.

25:31.164 --> 25:33.041
He's a McIntosh,
they're quite unreliable.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.918
So I'm told, repeatedly.

25:35.002 --> 25:37.004
I wonder if you could help me?

25:37.087 --> 25:42.217
I seem to have
mislaid my glasses
and I need to, er...

25:42.301 --> 25:44.136
Here.

25:44.219 --> 25:47.556
"Intelligence of
Ian McIntosh's escape

25:47.639 --> 25:50.475
"passed quickly
through the MacDonald clan.

25:50.559 --> 25:55.147
"A search party was raised
and the fugitive
was soon discovered

25:55.230 --> 25:57.107
"sheltering with
his accomplices

25:57.190 --> 26:01.069
at the Field of
the Three Hags.

26:01.153 --> 26:04.114
"Claymores were drawn,
arrows unsheathed,

26:04.197 --> 26:08.410
"each loyal
heart beat strongly,
steadfast and true,

26:08.493 --> 26:11.872
"as the MacDonalds
and the McIntoshes
engaged in battle."

26:11.955 --> 26:13.790
I'm very sorry,
Molly, I'm gonna have to go.

26:13.874 --> 26:15.917
Oh, of course, of course.

26:16.001 --> 26:18.045
I wonder, would you mind
if I borrowed this map?

26:18.128 --> 26:19.171
Be my guest.

26:19.254 --> 26:20.839
Thank you.

26:21.965 --> 26:23.216
Ah.

26:26.762 --> 26:28.305
Well,
er, thank you all for coming.

26:28.388 --> 26:33.769
Most of you know me
and I know most of you.

26:33.852 --> 26:39.858
You also know why we're here.
To protest against Boglecroft.

26:39.942 --> 26:43.111
That's why this
petition is so important.

26:43.195 --> 26:46.573
Ladies and gentlemen,
I know that I
can't fight this alone,

26:46.657 --> 26:51.370
but I think together
we have a real
chance of saying no.

27:02.464 --> 27:05.467
Ah, Duncan. The very man.

27:05.550 --> 27:06.885
What do you want with me?

27:06.969 --> 27:08.428
I need your help.

27:08.512 --> 27:12.599
Your enthusiasm, your stamina
and most of all your brawn.

27:12.683 --> 27:16.061
I think I've found a way
to save Archie's bacon.
Come on.

27:19.690 --> 27:23.610
Join me in a vote to
protect our future.

27:23.694 --> 27:25.696
Let's say no to Boglecroft.

27:28.615 --> 27:32.244
What about the jobs
that would be created?

27:32.327 --> 27:34.329
As I have said,
my own five-year plan

27:34.413 --> 27:37.124
will give a considerable boost
to employment in the area.

27:37.207 --> 27:38.834
But you can't deny
that it will attract

27:38.917 --> 27:41.670
tourists and put money
into the local economy.

27:41.753 --> 27:43.964
In the short-term maybe,
but over a longer period

27:44.047 --> 27:46.133
it will draw wealth
away from the village.

27:46.216 --> 27:48.844
Before long, this place
will have become a ghost town.

27:48.927 --> 27:51.305
Mr McIntosh's
proposals clearly state...

27:51.388 --> 27:53.682
That's just hype and hot air.

27:53.765 --> 27:56.852
A personal guarantee,
can you give
that on his behalf?

27:56.935 --> 27:58.020
You know I can't.

27:58.103 --> 27:59.313
Well, I can.

27:59.396 --> 28:02.524
I was born here.
My ancestors are buried here.

28:02.608 --> 28:04.568
I am not going to cut and run.

28:04.651 --> 28:08.447
But Mr McIntosh, a man who
can't even be
bothered to turn up today,

28:08.530 --> 28:10.324
certainly won't
be here tomorrow.

28:10.407 --> 28:11.867
I'm sure he must
have a very good

28:11.950 --> 28:13.535
reason for
missing this meeting.

28:13.619 --> 28:16.496
But obviously no
interest in local opinion.

28:16.580 --> 28:21.376
A long-term partnership
for mutual benefit,
that's my promise.

28:21.460 --> 28:25.672
And all I'm asking in return
is your signatures
on this petition.

28:26.423 --> 28:27.633
This is abduction.

28:27.716 --> 28:30.719
A justifiable taking
of a prisoner, McIntosh.

28:30.802 --> 28:33.013
An army without
a leader never wins.

28:33.096 --> 28:35.641
The most valuable lesson
history has to teach us.

28:35.724 --> 28:37.768
I've not got an army.
There's only me.

28:37.851 --> 28:39.561
Better still.

28:39.645 --> 28:41.688
Archie can hold his meeting
without any fear
of interruption.

28:41.772 --> 28:43.982
Did you bring the thumbscrew,
Golly?

28:44.066 --> 28:47.611
Oh, I'd say he was more of
a rack man myself, boss.

28:47.694 --> 28:49.655
STUART: Lexie.

28:49.738 --> 28:54.242
Stuart, what are you doing...
Och, have you two gone
totally off your rockers?

28:54.326 --> 28:55.494
Let him out.

28:55.577 --> 28:56.703
Not as easy as that.

28:58.246 --> 28:59.539
Yes, it is.

28:59.623 --> 29:01.208
Stop her, Golly, stop her.

29:01.291 --> 29:02.834
STUART: Good girl.

29:02.918 --> 29:04.252
(ALL SHOUTING)

29:17.140 --> 29:20.936
Right, Hector.
Tunnel or wooden horse?

29:22.688 --> 29:25.732
MOLLY: Left.
I had a good job but I left.

29:25.816 --> 29:30.570
Right. Right. It jolly
well serves you right.

29:30.654 --> 29:34.950
This is rather fun, isn't it?
Like a treasure hunt.

29:38.787 --> 29:40.539
Are we nearly there?

29:40.622 --> 29:43.834
Well, we come out of the woods

29:44.710 --> 29:47.254
to the mountain path...

29:48.005 --> 29:49.381
Oh.

29:50.257 --> 29:52.217
This isn't on the map.

29:54.678 --> 29:57.764
Look. North-northeast.

30:02.269 --> 30:04.646
South-southwest.

30:04.730 --> 30:08.567
Duncan, what would I do
without you? About turn.

30:08.650 --> 30:12.237
Left. Left.
I had a good job but I left.

30:13.071 --> 30:14.114
Thank you.

30:16.366 --> 30:18.243
Ah, decided to put in
an appearance, then?

30:18.327 --> 30:20.287
I've been in a cell
for the last three hours.

30:20.370 --> 30:22.164
Must be your past
catching up with you.

30:22.247 --> 30:26.209
Actually I was
locked up by your father.
That's right.

30:26.293 --> 30:28.295
The MacDonalds were so
keen to prevent me from

30:28.378 --> 30:30.339
telling you the truth
about their intentions,

30:30.422 --> 30:33.133
that I was held
against my will.

30:33.216 --> 30:35.677
No doubt there's
been a lot of talk
from the laird here

30:35.761 --> 30:38.430
of how much his family
have done for you in the past.

30:38.513 --> 30:43.226
Along with the promise of
an even brighter future,
when, in fact,

30:43.310 --> 30:45.437
letters have already
been signed refusing

30:45.520 --> 30:48.023
genuine appeals from
impoverished local causes.

30:49.566 --> 30:53.320
All patronage will be
withdrawn so that this man

30:53.403 --> 30:56.239
can pull up the drawbridge
and fill his own coffers.

30:56.323 --> 30:57.574
This is nonsense.

30:57.658 --> 30:58.992
Are you denying the facts?

30:59.076 --> 31:00.118
Well, no, not...

31:00.202 --> 31:01.703
Er, exactly.

31:01.787 --> 31:04.331
You're pulling
the wool over the eyes
of these good folk.

31:04.414 --> 31:07.334
People to whom you
claim to be a friend.

31:07.417 --> 31:11.964
I say throw off the shackles
of tradition and subservience.

31:12.047 --> 31:15.217
Invest in your future
with a "yes" to Boglecroft.

31:15.300 --> 31:18.720
There'll be jobs and
prosperity for all.

31:18.804 --> 31:21.390
I did not show
him the letters.
He saw them on the desk.

31:21.473 --> 31:24.142
Where you just
happened to have left them.

31:24.226 --> 31:27.354
Well, congratulations.
You came here to
help save Glenbogle,

31:27.437 --> 31:28.939
and you've signed
the death warrant

31:29.022 --> 31:30.816
for the estate
and the community.

31:30.899 --> 31:33.235
Archie,
you forgot your petition.

31:33.318 --> 31:35.570
Three signatures.
I'm very impressed.

31:35.654 --> 31:37.531
(STUART LAUGHING MOCKINGLY)

31:37.614 --> 31:39.700
You sure you know what
it is that we're doing?

31:39.783 --> 31:41.785
Yes, Duncan.

31:41.868 --> 31:44.913
And,
anyway, I'm not turning back.

31:44.997 --> 31:48.208
But I don't even know
what it is we're
looking for exactly.

31:48.292 --> 31:50.252
The Three Hags, Duncan.

31:50.335 --> 31:52.170
They mark
an ancient battlefield

31:52.254 --> 31:55.007
and also the proposed
site of Boglecroft.

31:55.090 --> 31:56.967
Or so I thought.

31:57.050 --> 31:59.469
If I could just match the two,

31:59.553 --> 32:02.347
we could scupper
Stuart's plans.

32:02.431 --> 32:06.393
Well, he can't build on
an historic site, can he?

32:06.476 --> 32:10.397
(PANTING) Let's hope that
Archie's having
more luck than we are.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.024
Nature trail 4B.

32:12.107 --> 32:13.567
What?

32:13.650 --> 32:17.654
The Field Of The Three Hags.
It's on nature trail 4B.

32:17.738 --> 32:19.656
That's one of my
favourite walks.

32:19.740 --> 32:22.909
I don't believe it! You're
a treasure. Take me to it.

32:22.993 --> 32:25.954
You're here. You were
sitting on one of them.

32:26.038 --> 32:28.332
These are the other two.

32:28.415 --> 32:32.628
If only you'd told me,
I could have taken
you here in 10 minutes.

32:33.378 --> 32:34.463
Thank you.

32:34.546 --> 32:35.589
MAN:
Thank you very much indeed.

32:35.672 --> 32:37.049
-See you again.
-Bye-bye.

32:37.132 --> 32:39.301
You couldn't resist
fighting dirty, could you?

32:39.384 --> 32:41.386
Not if it means we
get what we want.

32:41.470 --> 32:44.139
And old Hector
hardly played it
by the book, did he?

32:44.222 --> 32:46.183
It's not Hector
I'm worried about.

32:46.266 --> 32:49.186
You've destroyed
any trust there was
between me and Archie.

32:49.269 --> 32:52.856
But look what you've gained.
Everyone's on our side now.

32:52.940 --> 32:55.359
We're a great team
with a great future.

32:55.442 --> 32:56.860
Once people have
been to Boglecroft,

32:56.944 --> 32:58.612
they're gonna
want to come back.

32:58.695 --> 33:01.073
And as the demand for
timeshare increases,
we can build to order.

33:01.156 --> 33:03.325
But you can
only expand so far,

33:03.408 --> 33:06.078
unless you want to
swallow
Glenbogle up completely.

33:06.161 --> 33:09.331
I'll pack
the MacDonalds' bags myself.

33:09.414 --> 33:13.835
I will not be party to that.
I'm supposed to
protect the estate.

33:13.919 --> 33:17.297
I think you'll find
I'm a much better bet.

33:17.381 --> 33:19.925
(SCOFFING) If that's
the way you see it,

33:20.008 --> 33:22.761
I might have to
withdraw my support.

33:22.844 --> 33:25.347
And tell the bank
you've changed your mind?

33:25.430 --> 33:28.141
That won't do your
reputation a lot of good.

33:30.435 --> 33:34.147
Look, we don't have
to fall out over this.

33:34.231 --> 33:36.733
There's a bottle of
champagne back in my room.

33:36.817 --> 33:39.778
Why don't we drink to success?

33:39.861 --> 33:42.656
Save it for someone
who's in the mood.

33:47.953 --> 33:51.206
If I die first,

33:51.290 --> 33:55.585
you have my
permission to eat me.

33:57.629 --> 34:01.091
Thank you, Hector,
but I might just
give that a miss.

34:09.474 --> 34:13.103
Uh-uh. Those are for tomorrow.

34:13.186 --> 34:16.690
I thought you'd be
out with your boyfriend,
celebrating victory.

34:16.773 --> 34:19.525
Ahem. Not tonight. He's busy.

34:20.902 --> 34:23.071
So the meeting
wasn't a success, then?

34:23.155 --> 34:25.991
I think "complete disaster"
just about sums it up.

34:26.074 --> 34:29.286
I'm sorry things
haven't worked out
the way you wanted them to.

34:29.369 --> 34:31.330
Oh, don't worry.
I haven't given up quite yet.

34:31.413 --> 34:33.456
Stop everything!
Marvellous news.

34:33.540 --> 34:36.126
Duncan and I have found
the Battlefield
of the Three Hags

34:36.208 --> 34:38.795
and it's exactly where Stuart
plans to build Boglecroft.

34:38.879 --> 34:41.255
Oh, Mother, you're a genius.
And you can prove this?

34:41.340 --> 34:43.634
Ah,
well, we're working on that.

34:43.717 --> 34:46.178
Well, you find Father,
I'll nobble Stella, all right?

34:46.261 --> 34:47.346
Roger and out.

34:47.429 --> 34:48.513
Hello?

34:48.597 --> 34:49.681
I'm still here, you know.

34:49.764 --> 34:50.891
I'm sorry?

34:50.974 --> 34:52.809
Am I just supposed to
sit here while you pull

34:52.893 --> 34:54.770
the rug out from
underneath my boyfriend?

34:54.853 --> 34:58.273
I mean,
have you ever thought about
maybe trying working together?

34:58.357 --> 35:00.359
-What, me and Stuart?
-Why not?

35:00.442 --> 35:03.028
Because I don't fancy
another knife in my back.

35:03.111 --> 35:04.655
You are talking
about someone that

35:04.738 --> 35:06.239
actually means
something to me.

35:06.323 --> 35:09.368
He actually treats me
with a bit of respect,

35:09.451 --> 35:12.245
which is a welcome
change around here.

35:12.329 --> 35:13.580
If you've got any
more comments to make,

35:13.664 --> 35:15.540
then just keep
them to yourself.

35:21.964 --> 35:24.800
The Oxford English
Dictionary defines a dungeon

35:24.883 --> 35:30.055
as a subterranean stone cellar
for the incarceration and
correction of the guilty.

35:31.306 --> 35:33.725
The incarceration may be over,

35:33.809 --> 35:37.561
but the correction
is about to begin.

35:57.499 --> 35:59.000
I think this is
the time of day

35:59.084 --> 36:01.253
that it looks
its most beautiful.

36:01.336 --> 36:04.464
Yeah, and it'll look
even better once it's framed

36:04.548 --> 36:07.050
by a car park,
a couple of high-rises...

36:12.806 --> 36:14.308
Your petition.

36:15.601 --> 36:17.519
You've got four
signatures now.

36:21.523 --> 36:24.067
It's a bit of a sudden
change of heart, isn't it?

36:24.151 --> 36:26.987
You were right about Stuart.

36:27.070 --> 36:30.198
He would happily
destroy your family's home.

36:31.825 --> 36:35.203
And I've just given him
the helping hand to do it.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.876
If you were given
the opportunity to

36:40.959 --> 36:43.211
pull out of Boglecroft,
what would you do?

36:44.046 --> 36:46.423
I'd jump at the chance.

36:46.506 --> 36:48.842
Good,
because I need your help.

36:50.427 --> 36:54.973
Stuart is planning to build on
a 500-year-old battlefield.

36:55.057 --> 36:56.725
Once we can prove it,
then the council

36:56.808 --> 36:58.602
will have to refuse
planning permission

36:58.685 --> 37:01.396
and the bank will
withdraw its support.
And that's where you come in.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.856
And this can be backed up?

37:02.940 --> 37:07.569
Well, no, not yet,
but we're on the case.

37:07.653 --> 37:11.615
Well, with council support
we might be able
to stall Stuart.

37:11.698 --> 37:13.992
We'd need something tangible,

37:14.076 --> 37:16.828
something of real
historical significance.

37:16.912 --> 37:18.956
(SIGHING)

37:19.039 --> 37:21.541
But I have done such
a good sell to the bank

37:21.625 --> 37:23.710
that they'd probably
press ahead without me.

37:23.794 --> 37:26.129
Well, surely it's
worth giving it a shot?

37:27.631 --> 37:29.758
They'd just laugh in my face.

37:31.718 --> 37:33.387
I'm sorry, Archie,

37:33.470 --> 37:34.930
but I think we're going
to have to get used to

37:35.013 --> 37:37.057
the idea of
having Stuart around.

37:37.891 --> 37:39.309
Marvellous.

37:41.228 --> 37:44.856
Well, at least he
won't try it on with you.

37:44.940 --> 37:48.068
Yeah, twice so far.
And knowing him,
it won't be the last.

38:04.167 --> 38:06.461
DUNCAN: What are we
digging for, Molly?

38:06.545 --> 38:08.005
Hard evidence.

38:08.088 --> 38:09.715
Hard labour more like.

38:09.798 --> 38:14.011
But if there are weapons here,
I mean,
they could be anywhere.

38:14.094 --> 38:17.764
Trust my luck, Duncan.
I've backed long
shots before and won.

38:17.848 --> 38:20.350
Aye,
but my luck's not that great.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.853
And it's me that's
doing the digging.

38:22.936 --> 38:24.855
It's all right,
we're here to help.

38:24.938 --> 38:26.648
Not before time. I think
I've strained something.

38:26.732 --> 38:30.444
Come on,
we're all in this together.
This is our last chance.

38:50.130 --> 38:53.175
Oh, good morning,
O One Who Must Be Obeyed.

38:53.258 --> 38:55.594
And was your night
filled with Eastern promise?

38:55.677 --> 38:57.304
Not exactly, no.

38:57.387 --> 38:59.431
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

38:59.514 --> 39:02.643
I had a great night,
me and my man.

39:02.726 --> 39:06.563
Here, get some of that in you.

39:06.647 --> 39:09.024
Might put a sparkle
back in your eyes.

39:12.736 --> 39:13.862
(SIGHING)

39:13.946 --> 39:16.949
Look, Lex, um, I know
how fond of him you are

39:17.032 --> 39:19.534
and how he makes you
feel good and everything,

39:20.619 --> 39:23.538
but are you sure he's okay?

39:23.622 --> 39:27.709
Yeah, I am.
He doesn't make me wait.

39:27.793 --> 39:31.088
And there's no baggage.
That makes him very okay.

39:31.171 --> 39:32.798
Okay?

39:34.466 --> 39:36.510
Um, no. Not okay.

39:37.719 --> 39:40.847
You know how much
I've always valued you.

39:40.931 --> 39:43.183
Yeah,
like an untouchable vase.

39:43.267 --> 39:47.145
No, as a friend. Well,
more than just a friend.

39:52.818 --> 39:56.947
Arch, if you're trying
to tell me something,
just hit me with it.

39:58.991 --> 40:04.288
He, um, he tried it on
with her, with Stella.

40:04.371 --> 40:07.749
In fact I think
he's had his eye on her
since the moment they met.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.711
Don't try and
spoil this for me.

40:10.794 --> 40:13.839
Are you jealous or something?
Is that it?

40:13.922 --> 40:15.966
Is he moving in
on your territory?

40:16.049 --> 40:17.676
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

40:17.759 --> 40:19.303
I don't know
how you can do it.

40:19.386 --> 40:20.554
What?

40:20.637 --> 40:21.763
Keep a straight face.

40:21.847 --> 40:23.765
Okay,
you might not like Stuart,

40:23.849 --> 40:26.059
but making up
a story like that.

40:26.643 --> 40:28.186
It's really low.

even have to ask.

surely you can't stand back

43:15.812 --> 43:18.315
and watch an important
piece of local history

43:18.398 --> 43:20.275

to hold off on Boglecroft.

of an historic site.

Save the folklore
for your punters.

about this
quaint local legend.

revealed nothing.

the scissors to the lady.

wouldn't be the only thing

50:14.356 --> 50:15.941
before they
finish all the food.

50:16.024 --> 50:17.276
All right,
have it your own way.

50:17.359 --> 50:18.568
Oh,
just a minute, before we go.

50:18.652 --> 50:20.654
Er, could you tell
me how to work these?

50:20.737 --> 50:22.364
I don't want to
charge people and then

50:22.447 --> 50:24.032
mess it up when I
put it on their wrists.

50:24.116 --> 50:25.784
It's quite easy. Put it
on your wrist like this.

50:25.867 --> 50:28.203
No,
let me do it to you, darling.
You're the customer, you see.

50:28.287 --> 50:29.871
-Over there?
-Yes.

50:29.955 --> 50:31.206
Now, wait a minute.

50:31.290 --> 50:33.583
-This is the padlock thing.
-Snap it closed.

50:33.667 --> 50:35.085
Wait a minute.
Don't rush. Ah, there we are.

50:35.168 --> 50:36.503
That's it, easy.

50:36.586 --> 50:38.630
Right, now, take it off.

50:38.714 --> 50:42.467
Not until you agree to
a revised version of
your McIntosh saga.

50:43.510 --> 50:46.805
Now, how will it go?

50:46.888 --> 50:49.433
Hector Naismith MacDonald.

50:50.892 --> 50:52.853
A champion amongst men.

50:54.813 --> 50:55.939
Blast!
