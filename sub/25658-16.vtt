You've got bugs!

18:48.877 --> 18:50.879
[all screaming]

18:51.171 --> 18:55.300
- Bugs? This is the first
time in 25 years

18:55.384 --> 18:57.302
I've ever had
any kind of bug--

18:57.386 --> 18:58.971
{\an1}- Okay, fine, we're all
having a bad day--get over it.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.139
{\an1}- I just want you
to know, sir,

19:01.223 --> 19:02.933
{\an1}that we'll have your place
back open so you can

19:03.016 --> 19:04.101
{\an1}get back to serving
high-quality pies in--

19:04.184 --> 19:08.605
- Enough! Let's get back
to exterminating!

19:08.689 --> 19:11.400
Wah-hah hah hah hah hah!

19:11.483 --> 19:13.402
Hah hah hah hah!

19:13.485 --> 19:14.528
- So should we be
worried about him?

19:14.611 --> 19:15.779
{\an3}- Probably.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.073
- They're all gonna pay!

19:18.156 --> 19:21.952
- Soon,
everyone'll know our name--

19:22.035 --> 19:22.870
DIGG! Who should we get
to direct

19:22.953 --> 19:25.664
our first music video, huh?

19:25.747 --> 19:27.916
[drilling sound]

19:29.960 --> 19:30.794
{\an8}- Can we fight 'em
with the drill?

19:30.878 --> 19:33.422
{\an8}- No! It would be
far too effective.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.466
- Your personal vendetta
against us

19:36.550 --> 19:38.552
is over!

19:38.635 --> 19:40.512
- What are you idiots
talking about?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.764
We've never met you
before today.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.600
- Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

19:44.683 --> 19:47.728
Sure!
Attack!

19:48.353 --> 19:49.771
- Cowabunga!
- Aaaahhh!

19:49.855 --> 19:51.023
[battle cries]
- [chortling]

19:51.106 --> 19:53.275
- Whoa!
- Oh!

19:54.151 --> 19:56.528
[overlapping yelling]

19:56.612 --> 19:58.530
{\an3}- Dig!

19:58.614 --> 19:58.947
Dig, dig, dig, dig!

19:59.031 --> 20:00.824
Dig, dig!

20:00.908 --> 20:02.576
- Stop saying that!
- Dig, dig, dig!

20:02.659 --> 20:06.622
{\an1}- All right, why are you
ruining Pizza Week?

20:06.705 --> 20:07.998
- Who cares about pizza?

20:08.081 --> 20:10.667
We're an underappreciated band.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.461
- That hates <i> pizza!</i>

20:12.544 --> 20:15.088
- Why are you so focused
on the pizza?

20:15.172 --> 20:18.342
We're taking out the pillars.
- Pillars?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.969
<i>- Once we take out</i>
<i>this last support pillar,</i>

20:21.053 --> 20:22.387
<i>the Kaufman Coliseum</i>
<i>will sink down,</i>

20:22.471 --> 20:26.516
<i>giving us a captive audience</i>
<i>to rock out for.</i>

20:26.600 --> 20:26.975
[rapid chords]

20:27.059 --> 20:28.852
Yeah!

20:28.936 --> 20:31.230
Yeeeaaah!
<i>- Time out.</i>

20:31.313 --> 20:33.482
So you're saying this
isn't a multilevel conspiracy

20:33.565 --> 20:36.485
that may or may not involved
the mayor or Illuminati

20:36.568 --> 20:40.155
or centers around taking down
our four favorite pizza places?

20:40.238 --> 20:43.325
{\an1}- No. We don't even
like pizza, dude.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.661
{\an3}- Unless pizza's
for digging!

20:45.744 --> 20:49.331
- So you're saying
that not only did you destroy

20:49.414 --> 20:51.208
everything I love in the world,

20:51.291 --> 20:54.169
{\an1}but you didn't even have
the common courtesy

20:54.252 --> 20:56.004
to know you were doing it?!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.966
- So you guys just wanna
play a gig?

20:59.049 --> 21:01.468
- Yes! And gig rhymes with dig!

21:01.551 --> 21:04.513
<i>- Like I said,</i>
<i>Pizza Week is a magical time.</i>

21:04.596 --> 21:07.891
<i>It can bring families</i>
<i>back together...</i>

21:07.975 --> 21:09.601
[crowd cheering]
- For too long

21:09.685 --> 21:12.980
my family has been torn apart
by pizza.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.232
But no more!
Today, we come together

21:15.315 --> 21:19.695
as Famous Lou-Mike-Tony-
Toney's Pizza!

21:19.778 --> 21:21.154
<i>- It can create</i>
<i>new beginnings...</i>

21:21.238 --> 21:23.865
- Hit it,
my costumed friends!

21:23.949 --> 21:26.702
- One, two, three, four.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.162
♪ Pizza pit, pizza pit ♪

21:29.246 --> 21:31.331
♪ Munch, munch, munch
in the pizza pit ♪

21:31.415 --> 21:34.209
♪ Eat some crust,
eat some crust ♪

21:34.292 --> 21:36.378
♪ Crunch, crunch, crunch,
gonna eat some crust ♪

21:36.461 --> 21:40.382
<i>- It can make dreams</i>
<i>come true.</i>

21:40.465 --> 21:42.384
And that's how,
for one week,

21:42.467 --> 21:46.555
or five weekdays
and two weekend days,

21:46.638 --> 21:48.348
Pizza Week was saved

21:48.432 --> 21:51.268
by me.
- Who are you talking to?

21:52.102 --> 21:56.732
