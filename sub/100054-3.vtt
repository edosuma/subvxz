WEBVTT

00:17.104 --> 00:18.627
- GUY: Trick or treat, asshole.

00:25.590 --> 00:30.726
- CREATURE:

00:48.352 --> 00:53.488
- CREATURE:

02:16.919 --> 02:18.138
- GUY AND GIRL: Trick or treat.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.530
- LITTLE GIRL: Trick or treat.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.280
- KIDS: Trick or treat.

02:35.851 --> 02:39.202
- Hey, Pete.
Where's Skeeter?

02:39.246 --> 02:43.163
- I haven't seen him yet.
We are the first.

02:43.206 --> 02:47.079
- Are we? Kinda wished we were--

02:47.123 --> 02:49.604
- Wish we were what?

02:49.647 --> 02:52.215
- This is the last time,
isn't it, Pete?

02:52.259 --> 02:56.828
The last time meeting like this?
All alone?

02:56.872 --> 02:59.570
- We gotta stick
to the rules, Jill.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.224
- The rules. Yeah.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.488
- We're...Golden Dragons, right?

03:04.532 --> 03:07.404
- BOTH: Part of a club.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.014
- Part of a club.

03:09.058 --> 03:12.104
Plus, she's the only dragon
we got with boobs.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.194
- Can't see much boob
in this lumpy outfit.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.065
- Hmm, can't see much
without it.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.589
- Hey, screw you, mush-mouth!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.115
You guys planning on getting
hitched

03:23.159 --> 03:24.726
before or after the baby?

03:24.769 --> 03:26.728
- Shut up.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.860
- Hey, where's Bobby?
And Skeeter?

03:28.904 --> 03:30.949
- I haven't seen 'em yet.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.430
- Look, man, gotta get
this show on the road.

03:33.474 --> 03:35.606
I'm hungry. Come on.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.523
I said old lady Morton's place.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.873
Now, she's always good
for a Milky Way.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.832
- She is not on the route,
Binky.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.877
- Eh, screw the route.
- Hey.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.314
Remember what happened
last time?

03:47.357 --> 03:49.490
We almost scared the poor lady
half to death.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.057
- Oh, yeah.
That was funny.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.624
That was a classic.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.930
- KIDS: Trick or treat!

04:02.981 --> 04:04.244
- PEOPLE: Trick or treat.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.553
- JILL: Hey, look,
there's Reevestein.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.729
- And the group nears
completion.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.688
- Hey, Bobby! Over here.

04:19.824 --> 04:23.088
- Same old stupid
skeleton suit, huh?

04:23.132 --> 04:24.307
- Picked up any loot
yet, Bobby?

04:24.351 --> 04:25.656
- I thought we weren't supposed
to start

04:25.700 --> 04:27.528
'til we was all together.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.747
Club rules and all that.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.488
You look like a walking
pimple, Bradwell.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.838
- Well, then it must be
like looking in the mirror.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.492
You ever consider cleaning
that piece of shit outfit?

04:35.536 --> 04:38.016
- You ever consider kissing
my Halloween ass?

04:38.060 --> 04:41.193
- We can't start without Skeeter
and I haven't seen him yet.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.500
- He's down by the old
iron gate, being a pain.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.633
- Why?
- He says he's sick

04:45.676 --> 04:49.027
of this Halloween stuff,
says he's too old for it.

04:49.071 --> 04:52.030
We're too old for it.
- Well, I second that bullshit.

04:52.074 --> 04:53.815
- 'Kay. Did you tell him
it was the last time?

04:53.858 --> 04:55.686
- No, I'm not his brother, Pete,

04:55.730 --> 04:57.775
so I don't tell him how
to hold his dick when he pees,

04:57.819 --> 04:59.037
you tell him.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.390
- Come on.

05:07.611 --> 05:10.962
- JILL: Hey. Hey, Skeeter.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.313
- You just can't quit, Skeet.
Okay?

05:13.356 --> 05:15.140
I mean, you're a golden dragon,

05:15.184 --> 05:17.055
an important
member of this club.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.449
I mean...you helped build
with the treehouse, remember?

05:21.886 --> 05:24.193
Look, hey.

05:24.236 --> 05:29.198
Look, I know how you feel,
but we all made a pledge.

05:29.241 --> 05:32.070
You know, gave our honor.
Like a family.

05:34.246 --> 05:37.641
Just...one more time, Skeet,
and we can kiss off

05:37.685 --> 05:41.906
these stupid costumes
and...be whatever we wanna be.

05:41.950 --> 05:42.994
Come on, what do you say?

05:43.038 --> 05:45.257
- He's tired, Pete.
He wants to rest.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.259
- Well, he's not the only one.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.699
- Come on.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.009
Let's do this.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.594
- Don't look at me like that.
Don't look at me like that.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.814
- KIDS: Trick or treat!

06:19.857 --> 06:22.251
- ALL: Trick or treat.

06:25.123 --> 06:28.997
- Trick or treat, Mr. Bodener.
- Dear God, not you.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.652
- In the flesh, so to speak.
- No, I don't know you.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.175
Don't know anything about you.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.917
- Well, you are currently
addressing the Golden Dragons,

06:35.960 --> 06:39.094
who are in dire need
of sustenance, so...

06:39.137 --> 06:40.356
kindly hand over the goods

06:40.400 --> 06:43.228
and spare us
the candy corn crap.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.622
- Here, just take it all.
Take it.

06:47.755 --> 06:51.846
- Kind of slim pickings, ah,
Mr. Bodener?

06:51.889 --> 06:55.545
- Suckers. That what you think
of us, Bodener, huh? Suckers?

06:55.589 --> 06:58.896
Oh, dear, dear,
and after all these years.

06:58.940 --> 07:02.639
- Well, I...the missus made
some cake yesterday,

07:02.683 --> 07:04.989
maybe I can go down--
- We're not about yesterday.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.513
Mr. Bodener.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.602
- Well, I guess we kind of are.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.038
But you would know all
about that,

07:10.081 --> 07:11.561
wouldn't you, Bodener?

07:11.605 --> 07:14.085
About a lot of yesterdays,
am I right?

07:14.129 --> 07:16.784
- Come on, guys, that's enough,
leave him alone.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.960
- PETE: Yeah, Jill's right.
Binky, let's go.

07:31.233 --> 07:35.063
-  Pissed himself.
- He did not.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.153
- Did too. Pissed himself
on his own front porch.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.720
Freaking loser.

07:39.763 --> 07:42.636
- Just shut up and eat, huh?
- Mm. You saw it, Jill.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.900
Big damp spot right
on his pants, am I right?

07:45.943 --> 07:48.163
- I wasn't watching his balls,
that's your hobby.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.034
- Oh!

07:50.078 --> 07:51.688
- Pissed his dighty.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.355
- Trick or treat, Mrs. Collins.

08:22.414 --> 08:27.419
- Ooh, hot muffins.
Not bad, Mrs. Collins.

08:27.463 --> 08:31.380
- Mmm, some of these are
blueberry.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.470
I'm not too fond of blueberry.
What else you got?

08:34.514 --> 08:38.822
- I--I can make you a nice
ham sandwich, Binky.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.216
That is you in the devil
costume, isn't it?

08:41.259 --> 08:42.826
Binky Bradwell?

08:42.870 --> 08:45.612
- No. It's Michael Meyers,
Ms. Collins.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.266
- Monsters! You goddamn
little monsters!

08:48.310 --> 08:50.225
- No, no, Ralph, no, don't.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.096
- BINKY:
Enter the vengeful husband.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.750
How goes it, Ralphie-boy?

08:53.794 --> 08:56.492
Hey, people started naming
their kids Ralph.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.625
- Think you can get away
with this every year, do you?

08:58.668 --> 08:59.887
Think you can terrorize
the whole town?!

08:59.930 --> 09:01.584
- Hmm, gracious, no.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.282
Just this one
piece-of-shit neighborhood.

09:04.326 --> 09:06.328
- Knock it off, Reevestein.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.112
Come on, guys,
let's get out of here.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.169
- RALPH: Every year
you just keep coming back.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.910
You destroyed our lives.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.390
He was our only son.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.610
Our only boy.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.656
First it was the Smiths,
then the Kidners,

09:29.699 --> 09:33.050
then the Bodeners,
last year was us.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.878
Who's next, you psychotic
little bastards?

09:34.922 --> 09:36.924
When will you stop?!

09:36.967 --> 09:39.622
- When we're through,
Mr. Collins.

09:59.773 --> 10:03.080
- Doesn't look much
like a treehouse now, does it?

10:03.124 --> 10:05.169
- Doesn't look much like a tree.

10:11.436 --> 10:14.483
- All things must pass.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.703
- Look who's suddenly
brimming with nostalgia.

10:16.746 --> 10:20.271
- Hmm, I didn't think
you had it in you, Bradwell.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.751
- I had it in me.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.105
- PETE: You thinking about
Mom and Dad?

10:32.849 --> 10:34.372
I miss them too.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.274
- So, here we are.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.232
- Here we are at last.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.799
Long, long last.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.410
- Well, it better be
the very damn last.

11:12.454 --> 11:16.240
- Look, before you guys start
getting all sentimental,

11:16.284 --> 11:17.938
I don't think nobody's here.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.854
- Nah, they're here. Come on.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.785
- Trick or treat,
Mrs. Hathaway.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.222
- ALL: Trick or treat,
Mrs. Hathaway.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.140
- Trick, I guess.

12:04.375 --> 12:08.553
- Oh, Eddie.
Oh, Eddie.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.077
Where are you?

12:21.392 --> 12:23.525
- Is Eddie home, Mrs. Hathaway?

12:26.093 --> 12:27.572
- No.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.009
- You sure about that?

12:30.662 --> 12:33.143
He went to his grandparents'.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.885
He won't be back
for a month.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.800
- Or a year...maybe.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.588
- Get out!

12:43.632 --> 12:46.635
Every one of you,
or I swear I'll shoot.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.333
- Where's Eddie, Mrs. Hathaway?

12:49.377 --> 12:55.165
-  I said...
get out now!

12:55.209 --> 12:58.386
- We need Eddie, Mrs. Hathaway.

12:58.429 --> 13:02.694
We need him
to break the cycle.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.654
- I'm warning you,
one more step

13:05.697 --> 13:07.612
and I'll fire.

13:07.656 --> 13:11.355
- Then fire, Mrs. Hathaway.
Shoot me.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.096
Then shoot Binky,
and Bobby, and Jill,

13:13.140 --> 13:15.185
and even little Skeeter.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.013
If that's really what you
think is the answer,

13:17.057 --> 13:20.321
if you really think
that that will square things,

13:20.364 --> 13:21.931
make it all better.

13:21.975 --> 13:24.499
- JILL:
Is that what you think, ma'am?

13:24.542 --> 13:26.631
You think we really
wanna be here?

13:38.034 --> 13:41.037
I can't do this anymore.

13:41.081 --> 13:45.041
Year after year,
I worried he'd be next.

13:45.085 --> 13:48.915
I watched as you took
the others...one by one.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.050
- Hello, Eddie.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.796
- EDDIE: Okay.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.931
- If she's too chicken-shit
to do it, then I will.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.933
You too, dickhead.

14:06.976 --> 14:11.328
- Then do it, Eddie.
Pull the trigger. Do it.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.895
Killing things is quick.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.766
- Letting them grow
is what takes time.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.857
- I'll do it.
I ain't afraid.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.902
- Yeah? Then how come
you've been hiding behind

14:19.946 --> 14:22.949
your mother's apron strings
for all these years,

14:22.992 --> 14:26.387
just like all your other
candy-ass friends?

14:31.914 --> 14:34.569
No, no! No!

14:34.612 --> 14:37.354
- It's no good, Eddie,
they'll just keep coming back.

14:37.398 --> 14:41.402
- I am innocent! Mom!
Don't let them do this!

14:41.445 --> 14:43.317
- They'll find us
everywhere we go.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.798
- Don't let them do this!
Get off of me!

14:46.842 --> 14:52.543
Mom! Help me, please!
Please!

15:00.203 --> 15:02.075
- Jill, did you need
help with that?

15:03.859 --> 15:06.122
- No, it's okay, I got this.

15:06.166 --> 15:12.041
- Please, no. No!

15:12.085 --> 15:14.043
I tell you, it was
a Halloween prank,

15:14.087 --> 15:15.523
no one was supposed to get hurt.

15:15.566 --> 15:18.004
- Yeah, well,
people did get hurt.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.571
Didn't they, Eddie?
- EDDIE: But not by me.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.399
It was the other guys' idea.

15:22.443 --> 15:26.012
The other guys who started
the whole thing!

15:26.055 --> 15:27.927
You saw it, Skeeter.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.580
Tell 'em it wasn't me.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.713
Tell 'em I'm innocent.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.156
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

15:46.554 --> 15:50.036
- Hey, remember this?
Yeah, you brought this.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.734
That same night.
- This is murder.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.955
- Yeah, that's the same thing
all your old friends said.

15:55.998 --> 16:01.351
- Please. Please, please.
No.

16:01.395 --> 16:05.355
Oh, please! no!

16:13.363 --> 16:15.148
- Alright, let's see what it is,
man, 'cause I've been waiting

16:15.191 --> 16:17.150
this entire game.
- Pretty good.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.673
- Oh, 23.
- That's what I thought.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.196
- Ah!
- I was on it.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.286
- Hey, guys, it's dark.
Time for trick or treat.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.855
- Alright. Somewhere out there,
there is a Milky Way

16:26.898 --> 16:28.117
with my name on it.

16:28.161 --> 16:30.293
- Binky, do you ever
stop eating?

16:30.337 --> 16:33.209
- Why would I?
- Come on. I'm ready, let's go.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.909
- Hey, guys, it's stuck.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.563
- Uh, the frame's
probably warped

16:39.607 --> 16:41.609
from the wet weather.

16:41.652 --> 16:42.610
Here.

16:44.394 --> 16:47.006
No. Wait.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.443
No, it's really stuck,
it won't open.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.445
- Guys, look down there,

16:51.488 --> 16:52.881
isn't that
Eddie Hathaway's gang?

16:52.924 --> 16:55.188
- EDDIE:
It's gonna be hilarious.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.581
- What the hell are they doing
down there?

16:57.625 --> 17:02.369
- Hey! Losers!
- Shit. Is that a match?

17:03.935 --> 17:06.634
- Ooh.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.813
Whoa!

17:11.856 --> 17:14.555
Hey, you better climb down
and run home to mama!

17:14.598 --> 17:16.861
- GANG:

17:19.429 --> 17:20.561
- EDDIE: You kids better run,

17:20.604 --> 17:22.171
it's gonna go up fast!

17:22.215 --> 17:24.043
- Wooh!

17:24.086 --> 17:26.436
- Alright, guys, I think
we scared them off.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.483
- We need to get out. Go!
- Let's go!

17:29.526 --> 17:31.746
- JILL: It's not funny!
- BINKY: Somebody help!

17:31.789 --> 17:36.272
- PETE: No, Eddie! Eddie!
- BOBBY: Please! Help! Help!

17:36.316 --> 17:38.361
- PETE: Open the door! No!

17:42.974 --> 17:45.934
- You're crazy!
You can't get away with this?!

17:45.977 --> 17:48.850
- Why not, Eddie?

17:48.893 --> 17:51.200
- You did.
- EDDIE:

18:06.520 --> 18:09.436
No!

18:19.924 --> 18:22.492
- Well, that's that.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.451
- Not soon enough for me.

18:24.494 --> 18:28.411
- It's good to be home, though,
gotta admit.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.718
Are you sure you got enough
to eat now, Bradwell.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.589
- Shut up, Reevestein.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.244
You're just jealous 'cause
my costume's cooler than yours.

18:35.288 --> 18:38.813
- Yeah, real cool.
Like a figure skater.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.475
- I guess I'll see you in...

18:48.518 --> 18:50.738
- In...my dreams.

19:15.023 --> 19:18.809
- Get some rest now, Skeet.
You hear me?

19:18.853 --> 19:20.376
Get some rest.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.690
I wish we'd known
each other longer, Skeet.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.391
- PETE: I love you,
little brother.

22:31.045 --> 22:34.570
- Ah! Ah, ah!

22:37.443 --> 22:39.140
- What? No, no, no, no, no.

22:41.447 --> 22:42.839
Fuck!

22:42.883 --> 22:45.276
- Um, hi, why are you
Facetiming me?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.844
- Fucking seriously?!
- Yes, seriously.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.456
Look, I meant everything
that I said.

22:50.499 --> 22:52.458
You going home to beg
your dad for money

22:52.501 --> 22:55.678
doesn't magically erase
our situation.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.681
Where are you?
Are you drunk dialing me?

22:58.725 --> 22:59.813
- No!

23:02.206 --> 23:04.948
- CARLA: Are you high?

23:04.992 --> 23:06.254
- What's that got to do
with anything?

23:06.297 --> 23:08.387
- A lot actually.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.912
Look, this...whole breakup,
it's--it's not you, it's me,

23:11.955 --> 23:14.001
that's what I'm supposed
to say, right?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.655
I can't. Right?
Not without lying,

23:15.698 --> 23:17.091
and I don't fee like lying.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.135
- But I--
- I just want

23:18.179 --> 23:19.615
somebody motivated.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.574
Justin, I feel like
you wouldn't even care

23:21.617 --> 23:24.228
if you got bounced
from university tomorrow.

23:24.272 --> 23:27.231
- I'm pacing myself!
- Okay.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.147
Well, you get something going,
let me know,

23:30.191 --> 23:31.627
we can maybe talk about this.

23:31.671 --> 23:35.849
But until then,
I gotta go, okay? Bye!

Please. Please help me.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.331
Yeah, okay, Alex,
I'll do just that.

25:50.374 --> 25:52.115
You have to blow me first, okay?

25:55.031 --> 25:56.250
Alex.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.820
Alex, I know you're
fucking with me, dude.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.170
- MAN: There is no Alex here.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.409
- MAN: Please.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.162
What the hell, man?

26:39.206 --> 26:43.036
-  Please, turn my face
out of my suitcase

26:43.079 --> 26:46.605
so I may speak clearly.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.954
- What?

26:47.997 --> 26:49.608
- Please.

26:59.574 --> 27:04.971
- MAN:

27:06.146 --> 27:08.017
- I mean, really,
what the actual fuck?

27:08.061 --> 27:10.237
- Please, do not hit me.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.678
- What happened to you?

27:16.722 --> 27:20.856
- I offended someone...
I ought not have offended.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.859
- You got that right,
you look like a Bento box.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.905
- Will you help me?
- How?

27:25.948 --> 27:28.908
I mean, you look like you need
a hospital, like, yesterday.

27:28.951 --> 27:31.040
Let's, uh, let's put you
in my car,

27:31.084 --> 27:33.216
and I'll take--
- MAN: That's very kind of you.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.001
But there is nothing
that a Western hospital

27:35.044 --> 27:37.960
can do to help with this
condition.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.615
- Are you kidding? No, They--
they--they can do anything,

27:40.659 --> 27:41.877
I mean, there's this kid
in my school

27:41.921 --> 27:44.010
who wrecked his motorcycle
and lost his legs,

27:44.053 --> 27:46.055
and so now he uses
these Pogo stick things

27:46.099 --> 27:47.535
that they made for him--
- MAN: Yes, but--

27:47.578 --> 27:48.754
- --and now he's, like,
good at basketball,

27:48.797 --> 27:50.973
which is weird, 'cause he, like,
sucked before,

27:51.017 --> 27:53.802
and now he's some sort
of unstoppable cyborg.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.586
- It's very interesting--
- JUSTIN: --I think it's going

27:55.630 --> 27:57.719
to his head, really,
because now he's mopping up

27:57.763 --> 27:59.590
the court with everybody
and talking smack about it,

27:59.634 --> 28:02.028
but not in a funny way--
- Excuse me, please.

28:02.071 --> 28:05.553
I do not mean to interrupt,
but I am in a great

28:05.596 --> 28:07.773
degree of pain, and I cannot
give your schoolyard drama

28:07.816 --> 28:10.601
the attention I'm certain
that it deserves.

28:10.645 --> 28:13.996
- Right, uh, I was taking
you to the hospital.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.521
- MAN: No!
- JUSTIN: Why not?

28:17.565 --> 28:21.569
- Because...they will find me.

28:21.612 --> 28:25.312
- Who? What,
the guys who did this to you?

28:27.749 --> 28:30.099
Oh, hang on if...if people
are looking for you,

28:30.143 --> 28:32.667
that means that they are
gonna come here, I...

28:32.711 --> 28:33.973
I gotta take you
back to the airport.

28:34.016 --> 28:38.107
- No!
- What?

28:38.151 --> 28:41.589
- If you just remove me
from the suitcase,

28:41.632 --> 28:44.287
I may be able to walk away
under my own power.

28:44.331 --> 28:48.074
- Oh, okay, okay, great, cool,
that'd be awesome, thank you.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.252
I don't really wanna be
a downer, it's just--

28:52.295 --> 28:54.776
it looks like the suitcase
is kind of the only thing

28:54.820 --> 28:56.256
keeping you together right now

28:56.299 --> 28:58.998
and I can't have you spilling
out and dying everywhere,

28:59.041 --> 29:01.609
I'm barely renting--
- Stop talking.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.568
Please.

29:04.612 --> 29:08.137
Just remove me from
the suitcase.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.923
Start with my feet. It's okay.

29:29.376 --> 29:35.295
- Yes, it is real,
an unfortunate condition

29:35.338 --> 29:40.779
causes me to produce gold
when I am in pain.

29:40.822 --> 29:44.739
- What--wait. What? How?
- I do not know how.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.873
- It's just not possible.
- I am afraid that since you

29:47.916 --> 29:50.223
are holding a coin you saw
come out of my mouth,

29:50.266 --> 29:52.486
the burden of disproof
is upon you.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.579
But I do not wish to talk.

29:58.622 --> 30:02.278
Perhaps we can try again
to free me later.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.846
Any wealth produced by our
efforts will, of course,

30:04.890 --> 30:08.981
be yours to keep in
consideration of your...

30:09.024 --> 30:13.420
valuable...assistance...

31:00.467 --> 31:03.557
- MAN: They will find me.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.906
- JUSTIN:

31:04.950 --> 31:06.081
If people are looking for you,

31:06.125 --> 31:07.909
that means that
they're gonna come here.

31:10.651 --> 31:11.826
- JUSTIN: Wait!

31:39.462 --> 31:42.813
- Well, what you got
here is a Gold 100 Kurush coin

31:42.857 --> 31:45.555
from the time of Abdul Amin
the Second.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.905
Not a lucky guy.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.732
He died after the first
world war,

31:48.776 --> 31:50.734
along with the Ottoman Empire.

31:50.778 --> 31:53.694
- But is it valuable?

31:53.737 --> 31:56.001
- You heard me say
it was gold, right?

31:56.044 --> 31:58.481
Of course it's valuable.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.135
How you come about that?

32:00.179 --> 32:02.181
- I found it in some luggage.

32:02.224 --> 32:05.314
- Nice. How about
I give you $275?

32:22.288 --> 32:24.943
- You should've asked for $350.

32:24.986 --> 32:28.337
He had to give you
at least $325.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.860
Why didn't you call me?

32:29.904 --> 32:32.124
- I did, we're having lunch.

32:32.167 --> 32:35.736
- No, I mean to negotiate.
You suck at this shit.

32:35.779 --> 32:39.261
No offense, but you kinda
let people walk all over you.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.307
Like Carla, for example.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.787
- Yeah, that's not
a problem anymore.

32:43.831 --> 32:47.574
- You okay?
Nah, of course you're not.

32:47.617 --> 32:52.666
She's, uh--
She's something.

32:52.709 --> 32:55.103
What about that coin?
Where did you, uh--

32:55.147 --> 32:56.409
where did you say you found
that, again?

32:56.452 --> 32:58.715
-  In some luggage.

32:58.759 --> 33:00.152
- Is there more?

33:01.805 --> 33:03.633
- Maybe.

33:03.677 --> 33:06.375
- Bullshit. I'm calling
blazing bullshit.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.290
Not that I'm mad, I would
lie to you about where

33:08.334 --> 33:12.860
I was getting $500 gold pieces--
even saying $500 gold pieces.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.123
That's some Dungeons and Dragons
shit, man.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.385
What'd you do,
roll up a dwarf?

33:19.345 --> 33:21.564
- Get away from me.
- What are you doing here?

33:21.608 --> 33:23.392
- I told you I was coming
to get my stuff.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.046
- What's wrong?
- I always knew you were

33:25.090 --> 33:27.570
a lot of things, Justin,
but never a murderer.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.194
- JUSTIN: Alex, guys, wait!

33:56.251 --> 33:58.210
- MAN, CARLA AND ALEX:

33:58.253 --> 34:01.169
- Fuck.
- Why--why is he in there?

34:01.213 --> 34:03.432
Justin, what did you do?!
- Me? Nothing no!

34:03.476 --> 34:04.738
I found him that way.

34:04.781 --> 34:06.609
- And you just left him
in there?!

34:06.653 --> 34:08.133
Shouldn't we get him out?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.699
- Oh, yeah, great idea,
why didn't I think of that?

34:09.743 --> 34:11.919
Look, it's a bit
more complicated.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.921
- MAN:
- CARLA:

34:13.964 --> 34:16.706
- Here, let me help you.
- MAN:

34:24.627 --> 34:27.108
- JUSTIN: Let's do it again.
- CARLA: Okay.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.860
- CARLA: What was that?
- MAN: It's too much.

34:39.903 --> 34:42.210
- JUSTIN: I don't know,
it happened last night, too.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.256
I think we should stop.
- MAN: I need to rest.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.996
- CARLA: You need to rest?
- MAN: It's too much.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.565
- CARLA: We need to get you out.
- MAN: Please. Please.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.176
- Come here.

34:51.219 --> 34:54.135
Just come here.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.964
You found it in a suitcase.
- Yeah.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.009
- Okay, guys, how the fuck
is he doing that?

34:59.053 --> 35:02.187
- It doesn't matter how
he's doing it, he's doing it.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.014
This is amazing, man,
we're gonna be fucking rich.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.581
- Whoa, first of all, "we"?
Second of all--

35:05.625 --> 35:06.887
- Okay, somebody please
explain to me

35:06.930 --> 35:09.019
what the fuck's going on?
- Yeah, "we."

35:09.063 --> 35:11.021
We're gonna be rich.
We're roommates, man,

35:11.065 --> 35:12.632
we share everything, right?
- What about him?

35:12.675 --> 35:13.981
- Not everything,
and second of all,

35:14.024 --> 35:15.722
we're just gonna help him
get out of the case.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.985
- Excuse me, young sir.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.342

the other young sir.

35:29.039 --> 35:31.259
to anybody--I feel like
something bad's gonna happen

35:31.303 --> 35:32.826
if we keep him around

No, young sir, please! Please!

35:58.025 --> 36:01.463
We keep him for 48 hours

you turned it up last time

37:48.222 --> 37:49.832

I mean, with this kind of money
we're close to being able

38:25.390 --> 38:28.871
to buy vacation homes
somewhere tax-sheltery...

38:28.915 --> 38:30.873
with boats!

38:30.917 --> 38:32.571
- Fucking boats, man.

38:32.614 --> 38:36.139
- No, we agreed, 48 hours.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.140
Alex.

There comes a time where you're
gonna need to ask yourself

who you wanna be?
- Why is he still talking?

38:42.972 --> 38:46.976

I wanna be rich.

38:47.020 --> 38:50.197
Fucking look around.
Open your fucking eyes.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.808
With this kind of money,
you can buy your dad's business

38:52.852 --> 38:54.506
and make him work for you.

38:54.549 --> 38:55.985
- No, no, no, you two
are fucking evil.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.378
This is bullshit.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.425
- Justin, how did you think
this was gonna end?

39:00.468 --> 39:02.601
- I didn't think it was gonna
end up with us being murderers?!

39:09.172 --> 39:10.348
I'm calling the cops.

That's what we do, we--
we get the hell out of here.

This kind of money, it'll--
it'll take us to Paris, to...

40:16.022 --> 40:19.025
to Rio...maybe Constantinople.

40:19.068 --> 40:20.722
- That's not a place anymore.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.158
- Shut up.

40:24.117 --> 40:25.510
- What do we do about him?

40:28.861 --> 40:30.819
- I say we get one last
jackpot and blaze.

40:35.302 --> 40:39.959
-  Oh, no,
please don't.

40:40.002 --> 40:41.787
You naughty children.

40:47.357 --> 40:50.317

- It was delightful,
most productive, as always.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.684
I trust everything
is in order?

42:36.728 --> 42:39.165

arriving in Istanbul

42:39.208 --> 42:40.470

you'll be able

42:41.689 --> 42:43.691
to accommodate my bags.

42:43.735 --> 42:46.389
