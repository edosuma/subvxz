00:30.917 --> 00:33.586
[theme song playing]

01:19.591 --> 01:22.343
Oh, mans. It's glorious!

01:22.427 --> 01:24.971
Watching TV will never be the same.

01:25.055 --> 01:28.433
Can you believe someone was just
throwing this beauty away?

01:28.516 --> 01:30.977
I mean this baby's got it all!

01:31.394 --> 01:33.813
That pristine wood foam laminate.

01:33.897 --> 01:36.983
Brackets for CDs, DVDs, cassettes,

01:37.067 --> 01:39.194
all kinds of obsolete physical media.

01:40.236 --> 01:42.405
A family of marmots
living in a stereo drawer.

01:42.489 --> 01:43.323
[marmots squeaking]

01:43.406 --> 01:46.868
And do not forget the shelving
for all of our many books.

01:48.536 --> 01:50.163
[all laughing]

01:52.165 --> 01:53.083
[Robin grunts]

01:53.375 --> 01:54.250
Ain't no thang.

01:54.334 --> 01:56.336
We just got to find something
to wedge under its.

01:57.754 --> 02:00.006
Hmm. Hmm.

02:06.304 --> 02:08.098
Think harder, genius.

02:13.812 --> 02:15.480
Yo, this little squidgy will do.

02:17.857 --> 02:20.068
Nice work! Now to see what's on.

02:20.151 --> 02:22.737
-[remote clicks]
-Hello, Titans!

02:22.821 --> 02:24.072
Control Freak?

02:24.155 --> 02:26.449
What madness
do you have in store this time?

02:26.533 --> 02:28.326
You gonna turn us into claymation?

02:28.410 --> 02:29.703
Make us hawk food processors

02:29.786 --> 02:32.038
in some tacky three-camera infomercial?

02:32.122 --> 02:33.998
Twist us into
a gritty live-action series

02:34.082 --> 02:35.792
targeted at adult audiences?

02:35.875 --> 02:38.920
That's been done. So gritty.

02:39.003 --> 02:42.549
Oh, weren't you clods paying attention
to the opening credits?

02:42.632 --> 02:44.676
In our defense, we were getting
this thing up the stairs.

02:45.510 --> 02:46.970
This is your...

02:47.053 --> 02:50.098
[reading] Super Hero Team
Crossover Event!

02:50.181 --> 02:51.516
[party horns squeak flatly]

02:52.058 --> 02:54.018
You mean like another movie?

02:54.102 --> 02:55.603
Uh, did I say, movie?

02:55.687 --> 02:59.023
[groans] Not a crossover.
That's when a lame show

02:59.107 --> 03:02.527
tries to glom onto a cooler one in order
to boost their popularity.

03:02.610 --> 03:06.740
-Oh, no! Are we's being canceled?
-One can only hope.

03:07.365 --> 03:09.325
Everyone knows a good crossover
has to have

03:09.409 --> 03:12.037
some epic threat that brings the heroes
from two worlds together.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.789
And epic threats just aren't our thing.

03:15.540 --> 03:19.002
Who said this was
a good crossover, huh?

03:20.170 --> 03:22.422
[gulps] He means business, Titans.

03:22.505 --> 03:24.090
We'd better play along. [grunts]

03:27.218 --> 03:29.345
Robin, please, what are you doing?

03:29.429 --> 03:30.930
In superhero crossovers,

03:31.014 --> 03:33.266
each team is introduced
in an action set piece,

03:33.349 --> 03:35.810
you know, to remind the audience
how awesome the heroes are

03:35.894 --> 03:37.771
even before they meet
their counterparts.

03:37.854 --> 03:40.607
Quick, everybody, do something action-y,
before they cut away to the other h--

03:40.690 --> 03:42.358
[thrilling music playing]

03:44.152 --> 03:45.987
[Catwoman] The superhero girls?

03:46.071 --> 03:48.823
But our plan for this heist
was purr-fect.

03:55.205 --> 03:56.164
[meows]

03:56.873 --> 03:58.875
Oh, oh, sorry, Mittens.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.711
No matter how "purr-fect" your plan is,

04:01.795 --> 04:04.672
our captain is always
gonna have a perfecter one.

04:04.756 --> 04:07.008
I'm flattered. But it is a team effort.

04:08.218 --> 04:09.636
[grunting]

04:09.844 --> 04:12.222
-[grunting]
-[Harley Quinn] Peek-a-boo!

04:12.305 --> 04:14.182
-I whomp you!
-[grunts]

04:14.599 --> 04:16.684
-Zatanna!
-I got her!

04:16.976 --> 04:18.978
[screams, grunts]

04:19.062 --> 04:20.730
-[laughs]
-[grunts]

04:20.814 --> 04:22.482
That's my friend, Harleen.

04:22.857 --> 04:25.860
Oh, you care about
your friends now, Babs?

04:25.944 --> 04:27.987
I do, when they're not supervillains.

04:28.071 --> 04:29.989
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

04:30.073 --> 04:31.282
Zee, are you okay?

04:31.950 --> 04:33.076
[growls]

04:34.869 --> 04:36.830
Wha-- Oh, yeah. Totally.

04:36.996 --> 04:37.914
How are you?

04:41.418 --> 04:44.587
One of these days, we're going to crush
you jerks! And...

04:44.671 --> 04:45.880
Wait. What's this?

04:45.964 --> 04:49.300
Ah, who cares what it is.
It's bustin' us free!

04:49.384 --> 04:51.344
So long, clowns!

04:56.349 --> 04:59.227
[scoffs] Let me guess.
Creepy purple cloud got 'em?

04:59.310 --> 05:01.062
Exactly. How did you know?

05:01.688 --> 05:04.566
Same thing happened to me last week
when I took Solomon Grundy down.

05:04.649 --> 05:06.317
And when I was pounding on the Riddler.

05:06.401 --> 05:08.987
Yesterday, I stopped
both Toyman and Cheetah.

05:09.070 --> 05:11.614
Each time...
[makes whooshing sounds] gone.

05:14.325 --> 05:18.705
Uh... Oh, nothing happened
to the bad guys I caught this week.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.791
Of course, I didn't catch any bad guys,

05:22.208 --> 05:25.003
but I did help my neighbor
find his lost cat.

05:26.421 --> 05:28.256
Sounds like we have a mystery to solve.

05:28.339 --> 05:32.510
Babs, I think what you meant to say
is, "we" have a mystery to solve.

05:32.594 --> 05:34.429
Boys, there's no need to compete.

05:34.512 --> 05:37.015
-Now! Go!
-[girls laughing]

05:37.098 --> 05:38.683
-[boys grunting]
-We'll let you know

05:38.767 --> 05:40.685
where the bad guys went
after we find 'em!

05:43.480 --> 05:45.106
[Lex Luthor] I know what
you're asking yourselves.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.025
What would a multi-billionaire like me

05:47.108 --> 05:49.444
want with such an eclectic group of...

05:49.527 --> 05:50.987
-you?
-[toilet flushes]

05:52.155 --> 05:54.365
This Hall of Doom
must've cost you a mint.

05:54.449 --> 05:57.535
You think you could afford a decent
hand-dryer in the ladies room?

05:58.620 --> 06:01.623
-[squishing sounds]
-Ew, real fur?

06:01.706 --> 06:03.792
-What are you, like, an actual cat?
-[growls softly]

06:03.875 --> 06:07.087
-Hey, Selina, eat your heart out.
-[Lex clears throat]

06:07.170 --> 06:11.883
What if I told you I hold the power
to get rid of every superhero?

06:15.011 --> 06:17.097
While searching through
the remains of Krypton,

06:17.180 --> 06:21.017
my space probe came across
The Amulet of Cythonna.

06:21.101 --> 06:25.230
This device uses an ancient science
even I have yet to understand.

06:25.313 --> 06:28.608
-But its power is undeniable.
-[Grundy scoffs]

06:28.691 --> 06:31.945
Power? Luthor no find trinket in space.

06:32.028 --> 06:34.906
Luthor find trinket in cereal box.

06:34.989 --> 06:36.741
[villains laugh boisterously]

06:38.743 --> 06:42.747
If it weren't for this, Chuckles,
you'd be in jail now.

06:42.997 --> 06:45.166
But if you are still not convinced...

06:46.626 --> 06:47.919
[grunts]

06:49.546 --> 06:53.383
-Uh, where'd he go?
-They call it the Phantom Zone.

06:53.466 --> 06:57.011
But you can think of it as our own
personal superhero dumping ground.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.515
[screams, grunts]

07:01.224 --> 07:04.477
[growls] If you have that,
why do you need us?

07:05.103 --> 07:08.773
Someone's gotta lure all those heroes
into our little trap.

07:08.857 --> 07:11.693
[Jessica] These are the spots
the mist was seen.

07:11.776 --> 07:13.278
Hmm. I don't see a pattern.

07:13.361 --> 07:15.488
But if you squint just right,
it kind of looks like a puppy.

07:15.572 --> 07:17.532
Come on, Babs. We have to ke--

07:17.615 --> 07:19.909
-Aw...
-Guys, check this out.

07:20.493 --> 07:22.245
See something in your armor-cam video?

07:22.328 --> 07:24.205
Not see, hear.

07:24.914 --> 07:28.334
-Just listen.
-[man] <i>Cythonna.</i>

07:28.418 --> 07:31.087
Uh, is it saying, cellphones?

07:31.171 --> 07:36.134
-Sounds more like "syphon oats."
-She's saying Cythonna.

07:36.551 --> 07:38.636
But that's impossible.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.138
What is Cythonna?

07:40.430 --> 07:42.307
Well, not what. Who.

07:42.682 --> 07:46.436
I mean, even a planet of science dorks
like Krypton had its mythology,

07:46.519 --> 07:50.690
and Cythonna was the goddess
of darkness, blight, and suffering.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.109
Yeesh. Bet she was a blast at parties.

07:53.193 --> 07:56.237
Story goes, she ran the show
on Krypton for centuries,

07:56.321 --> 07:59.866
<i>which was pretty much a hot heap</i>
<i>of stink for all concerned,</i>

07:59.949 --> 08:03.870
<i>until, one day, her kid brother, Rao,</i>
<i>god of sun and other stuff,</i>

08:03.953 --> 08:07.582
<i>trapped her in an amulet</i>
<i>and chucked her into space.</i>

08:08.083 --> 08:10.919
So while kids here are told to wish upon
a shooting star,

08:11.002 --> 08:16.424
we were told to behave, it could be
Cythonna coming to get you.

08:16.508 --> 08:18.468
And did you believe that?

08:18.551 --> 08:20.804
What? No! No. I'm from Krypton.

08:20.887 --> 08:25.558
No one believed in ancient
yet terrifying myths like that.

08:25.642 --> 08:28.228
So, yeah, let's just talk about
something else, all right?

08:28.311 --> 08:30.438
Did I hear there's a map
that looks like a puppy?

08:33.775 --> 08:37.153
'Sup nerds? Mind if we play?

08:37.236 --> 08:40.407
-[growls]
-[woman screams]

08:40.740 --> 08:42.741
[laughs]

08:45.370 --> 08:48.540
Hey, Giganta! You're not gonna
disappear this time.

08:48.623 --> 08:51.543
Oh, we ain't disappearing. You are!

08:51.876 --> 08:53.962
-Huh?
-[both scream]

08:55.255 --> 08:57.424
That's what happens to any superhero

08:57.507 --> 09:00.885
dumb enough to face the Legion of Doom!

09:05.056 --> 09:06.099
[grunts]

09:07.434 --> 09:08.518
[screams]

09:11.938 --> 09:12.939
Ooh.

09:15.483 --> 09:17.777
-[grunts]
-[screams]

09:24.200 --> 09:25.952
[grunting]

09:26.703 --> 09:27.704
[Green Lantern] Hmph!

09:31.166 --> 09:32.751
[screams]

09:33.835 --> 09:34.794
[cheering triumphantly]

09:35.211 --> 09:37.005
[laughing]

09:37.589 --> 09:40.967
Oh, no! [screaming]

09:41.551 --> 09:44.804
Oh, this is terrible!

09:44.888 --> 09:47.807
-Chin up, Garth. We're not done yet.
-No!

09:47.891 --> 09:50.894
Mr. Goodberry's cat got out again!

09:50.977 --> 09:53.021
[struggling]

09:53.563 --> 09:55.065
[cellphone rings]

09:56.107 --> 10:00.528
Hey, half-pint, you calling to say you
guys give up looking for the bad guys?

10:00.612 --> 10:03.323
[Garth] <i>No, we found them,</i>
<i>and it's not great.</i>

10:03.406 --> 10:06.951
-Wait. Garth, are you okay? Talk to me.
-[cellphone beeps]

10:07.035 --> 10:10.914
They've teamed up, and we think they got
Ollie, Hal, and Barry too.

10:10.997 --> 10:14.709
They call themselves the Legacy of Doom!

10:15.210 --> 10:16.753
[Hawkman] <i>It's the Legion of Doom,</i>
<i>Garth.</i>

10:16.961 --> 10:18.088
[Garth] <i>Really?</i>

10:18.171 --> 10:20.006
<i>I could swear Livewire said...</i>

10:20.090 --> 10:22.801
Guys, prioritize details. Where are you?

10:22.884 --> 10:24.427
The park! Hurry!

10:24.511 --> 10:27.347
I can't... hold... [screams]

10:29.516 --> 10:32.394
-[phone beeps]
-Team, to the park.

10:54.207 --> 10:56.835
Any sign of them? Oh, no.

10:58.503 --> 11:00.046
Hawkman's mace.

11:00.422 --> 11:02.924
-You don't think...
-[gasps] Hey, what's that?

11:03.007 --> 11:04.467
[chants incantation]

11:09.514 --> 11:12.517
It looks Kryptonian,
or maybe ancient Kryptonian,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.060
because I can only make out

11:14.144 --> 11:15.854
a few of the... the words.

11:16.396 --> 11:18.565
Oh. Oh, that's not good.

11:18.648 --> 11:20.024
What? What does it say?

11:20.108 --> 11:22.861
I think this thing sent our friends
to the Phantom Zone.

11:23.278 --> 11:25.113
You mean that creepy limbo dimension?

11:25.488 --> 11:27.782
But we saw what it took
to open a portal.

11:27.866 --> 11:28.992
How can one little ball...

11:29.075 --> 11:31.619
Cythonna. I'm not sure
what the rest of this says,

11:31.703 --> 11:34.664
but I know this says Cythonna.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.709
Clearly, whatever we're up against

11:37.792 --> 11:40.670
is far more formidable
than we anticipated.

11:40.754 --> 11:41.921
We will need a plan.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.465
How's this for a plan?

11:43.548 --> 11:46.384
Find the jerks who are using stuff
from my dead homeworld

11:46.468 --> 11:50.388
to hurt our friends and,
formidable or not, take 'em down.

11:50.472 --> 11:52.807
But how do we find this Legion of Doom?

11:52.891 --> 11:56.144
BT dubs, very cool name.
Makes you wish

11:56.227 --> 11:58.480
we put a little more effort
into Super Hero Girls.

11:58.563 --> 12:01.608
I got a hunch this little guy
might be our biggest clue.

12:03.151 --> 12:05.195
Kara, where are you going?

12:05.278 --> 12:07.030
To see a translator.

12:07.530 --> 12:11.117
[laughs] Legion of Doom?
That's rich.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.495
Quit it. I think they used
Kryptonian magic

12:13.578 --> 12:15.538
to send my friends to the Phantom Zone.

12:16.164 --> 12:17.999
See, this says Cythonna.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.419
[sighs] Your Kryptonian is awful.

12:21.503 --> 12:22.962
This doesn't say Cythonna.

12:23.046 --> 12:27.342
And even if it did, hello, there's no
such thing as Kryptonian magic.

12:27.425 --> 12:31.471
-Cythonna is a fairy tale.
-You think this is a joke?

12:31.554 --> 12:35.517
I'm sure your buddies are probably
just off goofing around somewhere.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.268
"Goofing around"?

12:37.352 --> 12:39.479
Remember when you couldn't
find that one kid for two days

12:39.562 --> 12:41.398
because he locked himself
in a port-a-pooper?

12:41.481 --> 12:43.525
Garth was only locked inside one day.

12:43.608 --> 12:45.568
He spent the second day in the shower.

12:45.652 --> 12:48.863
Look, Kara. This has been fun.
But if I thought for a second

12:48.947 --> 12:51.282
your pals were in danger
or someone got ahold

12:51.366 --> 12:54.869
of a Kryptonian weapon,
believe me, I'd be all over it.

12:56.371 --> 12:57.372
Hmph!

12:58.790 --> 13:00.583
She knows about the Phantom Zone.

13:07.382 --> 13:08.675
Still no guesses?

13:09.134 --> 13:10.009
I'll give you a hint.

13:10.510 --> 13:12.929
It's not bigger than a breadbox.

13:14.723 --> 13:15.765
Anyone?

13:16.891 --> 13:18.810
Okay. One more hint.

13:19.102 --> 13:22.605
It's not smaller than a breadbox either.

13:23.064 --> 13:25.734
Hal, I ran an hour out
in all directions.

13:25.817 --> 13:26.818
Nothing?

13:27.110 --> 13:30.405
Argh! And my ring still can't seem
to penetrate this darkness.

13:30.488 --> 13:31.448
I hate to say this.

13:31.990 --> 13:35.118
-We're stuck here.
-[Garth] Give up?

13:35.785 --> 13:39.080
It is a breadbox! Gotcha!

13:44.753 --> 13:46.546
[grunting]

13:48.256 --> 13:50.091
I failed.

13:50.175 --> 13:53.178
-I am sorry, Mother.
-Sorry?

13:53.553 --> 13:56.514
"Sorry" will not shield you
from a vengeful enemy.

13:56.598 --> 13:59.476
Nor will it shield those who follow you.

14:03.313 --> 14:04.606
-[gasps]
-Worried about the Legion of Doom?

14:04.689 --> 14:05.523
[mace thuds]

14:05.607 --> 14:08.401
Why? Are you concerned
a miscalculation in my leadership

14:08.485 --> 14:10.612
against this unknown evil
may bring you harm?

14:10.695 --> 14:14.407
Do you not realize I love you all
too much to allow that to happen?

14:14.491 --> 14:16.242
Zeus as my witness,
Barbara Gordon,

14:16.326 --> 14:17.994
that will not happen!

14:18.078 --> 14:20.163
Uh, thanks, D. I love you too.

14:20.830 --> 14:25.043
No, I was actually thinking about
the Legion because of Harleen.

14:25.418 --> 14:28.213
I thought, since we found out
each other's secret, she'd,

14:28.296 --> 14:30.298
-you know...
-Change her ways.

14:30.590 --> 14:33.134
I know Harleen, Diana. She's not evil.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.513
It is heartbreaking, but you do realize
that, for months,

14:36.596 --> 14:39.391
Harley Quinn has held a supervillain's
deadliest weapon.

14:39.474 --> 14:41.518
A heat-seeking poison-tipped scimitar?

14:41.601 --> 14:43.561
Your secret identity.

14:43.645 --> 14:46.856
She knows who you are, and yet,
has done nothing about it.

14:47.857 --> 14:51.027
You're right. So, I guess there is hope.

14:51.111 --> 14:52.779
[Supergirl groaning]

14:54.280 --> 14:56.574
Well, Super-jerk blew me off.

14:57.117 --> 14:58.410
[whispering] They still don't know.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.246
He would not help translate that sphere?

15:01.329 --> 15:04.165
Hmm. If only we had an ancient
Kryptonian-to-English dictionary

15:04.249 --> 15:05.625
lying around, huh?

15:06.084 --> 15:10.255
Actually, I know where we could find
something way better than a dictionary.

15:12.799 --> 15:15.343
[Zatanna exclaims] My heat spell
maybe keeping me warm,

15:15.427 --> 15:18.430
but this drastic climate change
is going to be murder on my hair.

15:18.513 --> 15:20.932
Okay, Zee.
Don't worry. Not much farther.

15:21.015 --> 15:23.685
-Not much farther to what?
-That!

15:40.035 --> 15:43.163
-Are you sure it's okay we're here?
-Totally not. No.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.582
That's why he calls it
his Fortress of Solitude,

15:45.665 --> 15:47.208
and not, I don't know, a...

15:47.292 --> 15:48.960
The Buddy Bunker?
Friendship Depot?

15:49.044 --> 15:50.879
Ooh. Kal-El's House of ha-has.

15:50.962 --> 15:52.422
Stop right there.

15:55.675 --> 15:58.011
Oh, we're in so much trouble.

15:58.094 --> 15:59.554
Stop right there.

16:01.765 --> 16:03.641
[Supermen] Stop right there.

16:03.725 --> 16:05.477
Stop right there.

16:06.853 --> 16:10.940
Kara, how many last sons
did Krypton actually have?

16:11.191 --> 16:13.610
Relax, these are
just his dumb robot guards.

16:13.693 --> 16:15.403
Hey, they're tall, tan, and gruesome.

16:15.487 --> 16:18.114
It's cousin Kara. I-- Ow!

16:18.406 --> 16:21.159
Huh? This one must have
a loose circuit or something.

16:21.242 --> 16:22.994
Just gonna take a quick look-see.

16:26.331 --> 16:30.126
Okay. Which one of you
glorified coffee makers is next?

16:43.598 --> 16:44.724
[electricity crackles]

16:44.891 --> 16:46.726
[chants incantation]

16:46.935 --> 16:48.436
[straining]

16:49.437 --> 16:50.772
[whimpering]

16:54.692 --> 16:56.361
[both grunting]

16:59.989 --> 17:01.908
[grunts] Ha-ha.

17:06.871 --> 17:09.082
Hmph! Gotta say, not impressed.

17:09.165 --> 17:11.917
-Where is Supergirl?
-[Supergirl] She's over here, gang.

17:12.669 --> 17:14.838
Good news, she got what we came for.

17:14.921 --> 17:17.339
Ta-daa! Told you we'd be in and out.

17:17.424 --> 17:19.759
You sure did. In fact, you can say

17:19.843 --> 17:22.679
you were a-head of the game. [chuckles]

17:22.762 --> 17:25.765
[laughing] Oh, you're so funny.
Oh, you're so funny.

17:25.890 --> 17:27.559
Guys, guys, I'm doing a...

17:27.642 --> 17:28.560
talking as both of us...

17:31.688 --> 17:32.564
[groans]

17:36.067 --> 17:38.069
So, Kara, what's in that case, anyway?

17:38.486 --> 17:41.698
[Supergirl] This is Krypton's
entire wealth of knowledge.

17:41.781 --> 17:44.242
It'll give us the true poop
on Cythonna and her amulet.

17:44.826 --> 17:45.744
Wow.

17:45.827 --> 17:49.414
A complete culture stored
in just a handful of crystals.

17:49.497 --> 17:53.001
[chuckles] Oh, yeah.
Kryptonians loved their crystals.

17:53.126 --> 17:55.211
These babies hold all kinds of things.

17:57.922 --> 17:58.882
Funny.

17:59.424 --> 18:00.967
I don't recall inviting guests.

18:01.718 --> 18:04.637
Another robot? I got this one.

18:04.721 --> 18:05.680
Batgirl, wait!

18:06.806 --> 18:08.183
[grunts] Ow!

18:08.266 --> 18:09.434
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:09.517 --> 18:11.186
He's real, he's real,
he's real, he's real!

18:12.187 --> 18:14.022
Put the crystals back, Kara.

18:14.731 --> 18:17.984
No way. Listen, Clark, I know
you don't believe me,

18:18.068 --> 18:20.070
but there is a huge threat.

18:20.695 --> 18:23.323
-I do believe you.
-Don't interrupt me!

18:23.406 --> 18:25.617
-Wait. Wha...
-You're right.

18:25.700 --> 18:28.828
In fact, I already knew Lex Luthor
is behind the Legion of Doom,

18:28.912 --> 18:30.830
and that they're sending heroes
to the Phantom Zone

18:30.914 --> 18:34.084
-using a Kryptonian device.
-The Amulet of Cythonna.

18:34.167 --> 18:38.004
Wait, so, if you knew all of this,
why did you blow me off at your place?

18:38.088 --> 18:40.840
Because I also knew
you're out of your league.

18:40.924 --> 18:43.134
Luthor is not to be trifled with.

18:43.218 --> 18:45.011
We've taken him down before.

18:45.095 --> 18:47.555
Not with a deadly weapon
like this, you haven't.

18:47.639 --> 18:50.517
I know Luthor. This time,
he's playing for keeps.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.893
What are you saying?

18:51.976 --> 18:53.353
What kind of hero would I be

18:53.436 --> 18:55.105
if I let a bunch of kids
walk off to their doom?

18:57.023 --> 18:58.566
Thanks, Dad.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.860
You think you could stop us on your own?

19:01.653 --> 19:04.489
Yeah, I do. But even if I couldn't...

19:09.869 --> 19:11.830
[Hawaiian tune plays]

19:11.913 --> 19:13.415
[exclaims]

19:20.588 --> 19:22.132
the Justice League could.

19:22.799 --> 19:26.094
The Justice League?
Another cool name!

19:26.511 --> 19:28.805
Yeah, I wanted to call ourselves
the Super Friends, man.

19:28.888 --> 19:30.265
But I got out-voted.

19:30.348 --> 19:31.975
[sighs] So unfair.

19:32.434 --> 19:35.979
I mean, we appreciate
the concern, gentlemen,

19:36.062 --> 19:38.481
but we are more than capable
of handling ourselves.

19:39.399 --> 19:41.359
Yeah, Jon, you helped train me on Oa.

19:41.443 --> 19:43.027
I was the top of my class.

19:43.111 --> 19:45.321
Sorry, rookie.
Pacifism won't cut it this time.

19:45.780 --> 19:46.865
Punches have got to be thrown.

19:47.991 --> 19:49.367
[Batgirl exhales] This is just dumb.

19:49.951 --> 19:51.119
Batman, buddy.

19:51.202 --> 19:53.288
Tell these guys how we saved Gotham.

19:53.997 --> 19:55.081
[hoarsely] Not this time.

19:55.290 --> 19:57.000
What do you mean, not this time.

19:57.876 --> 19:59.461
The league already has a plan.

19:59.586 --> 20:01.337
Frankly, you'd only be
getting in the way.

20:01.838 --> 20:03.548
Our friends are the ones in trouble.

20:03.882 --> 20:08.178
So, if we're in your way,
go ahead and move us.

20:08.678 --> 20:09.804
[Supergirl grunts]

20:09.971 --> 20:11.264

[Batarang skidding]

20:21.816 --> 20:24.110
Diamagnetic repulsor.
[gasps] So cool.

20:28.406 --> 20:29.741
I may not be swinging fists,

20:29.824 --> 20:32.118
but I have no problem
restraining you in one.

20:32.702 --> 20:33.578
I'm gonna disagree,

20:33.787 --> 20:35.663
and say you have a pretty big problem.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.459
[Zatanna gushes]

20:39.542 --> 20:40.460
So, uh,

20:40.543 --> 20:41.753
shouldn't we be fighting?

20:41.836 --> 20:43.338
Feel like we're just kinda
standing here.

20:43.797 --> 20:45.423
Oh, [clears throat]
I don't care.

20:45.673 --> 20:46.674
I'm up for whatever.

20:46.883 --> 20:47.842
What do you feel like?

20:49.761 --> 20:50.804
[Supergirl grunts]

20:51.054 --> 20:52.222
Kara, stay down.

20:52.639 --> 20:54.391
[sighs] Can't you see
I'm trying to protect you?

20:54.474 --> 20:55.558
[Kara groans]

20:56.017 --> 20:58.269
Do we look like we need protecting?

20:58.645 --> 20:59.771
[grunts]

21:01.815 --> 21:03.441
[both grunting]

21:05.652 --> 21:06.653
Enough!

21:08.780 --> 21:12.200
Woohoo, you guys are in trouble now.

21:12.784 --> 21:13.618
Superman,

21:13.702 --> 21:14.786
you say you have a plan

21:14.869 --> 21:17.038
stop the Legion of Doom
and free our friends?

21:17.205 --> 21:18.206
Yes.

21:18.289 --> 21:19.541
What about Cythonna?

21:19.874 --> 21:21.668
There is no Cythonna, Kara.

21:22.043 --> 21:24.212
The ancient science
that amulet uses may be deadly.

21:24.462 --> 21:25.630
But it's just another weapon.

21:25.964 --> 21:28.258
Once it's out of the wrong
hands, it's harmless.

21:28.341 --> 21:30.093
And you are confident in your plan?

21:30.176 --> 21:31.136
What do you think?

21:31.970 --> 21:34.514
[dramatic music playing]

21:38.601 --> 21:40.395
We shall defer to the Justice League.

[all gasp]

21:43.481 --> 21:46.192
[suspenseful music playing]

21:48.153 --> 21:49.612
[Supergirl] Are you kidding me?

21:49.696 --> 21:50.864
[girls groan]

21:55.201 --> 21:56.828
Ooh! I can't wait till those

21:56.911 --> 21:58.621
Super Hero Girls show their faces.

21:58.830 --> 22:02.167
And we send them to limbo for eternity.

22:02.417 --> 22:03.835
[all cackling]

22:05.587 --> 22:07.714
Yeah, but since it's eternity,

22:07.797 --> 22:08.757
we got time.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.633
I mean, it's not like
we have to send them

22:10.717 --> 22:12.010
to limbo today.

22:12.677 --> 22:14.471
[Poison Ivy laughing]

22:20.018 --> 22:21.895
You must be so proud.

22:22.270 --> 22:23.772
As their confidence grows,

22:23.855 --> 22:25.398
so does their malevolence.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.151
Have you forgotten, Cythonna?

22:28.610 --> 22:30.612
You are a silent partner.

22:30.695 --> 22:31.529
[Cythonna scoffs]

22:31.613 --> 22:35.116
Of course not. I appear to only you,
in this astral form.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.368
[Lex Luthor shudders]

22:36.451 --> 22:37.619
Albeit, weakly,

22:37.911 --> 22:39.829
for, as you know,

22:39.913 --> 22:41.456
my powers are limited

22:41.664 --> 22:42.916
while I remain trapped

22:42.999 --> 22:46.211
within this cursed prison forever.

22:46.711 --> 22:47.670
It's not all bad.

22:47.879 --> 22:48.755
Possessing your prison

22:48.838 --> 22:50.924
grants me access to that limited power.

22:51.007 --> 22:52.092
In return,

22:52.342 --> 22:53.385
I only ask--

22:53.468 --> 22:54.636
Oh, I know what you want.

22:54.719 --> 22:56.554
And perhaps once I,
Lex Luther, am victorious,

22:56.638 --> 22:57.764
I will indulge you.

22:58.765 --> 22:59.766
If I'm in a good mood.

23:00.350 --> 23:03.478
You haven't begun to know what I want.

23:03.561 --> 23:06.231
[mysterious music playing]

23:06.439 --> 23:08.775
[Supergirl] <i>We're gonna defer</i>
<i>to the league?</i>

23:08.858 --> 23:09.943
Okay, I'll admit,

23:10.026 --> 23:11.444
I don't know what defer means,

23:11.653 --> 23:12.904
but I'm pretty sure you told him,

23:12.987 --> 23:14.197
we just roll over.

23:14.989 --> 23:17.659
Since when do we back down from a fight?

23:17.909 --> 23:20.036
-Are you afraid--
-I am an Amazon!

23:20.120 --> 23:21.663
I fear no fight.

23:23.289 --> 23:24.124
Kara,

23:24.207 --> 23:27.001
your will is the strongest
of any warrior I have known.

23:27.168 --> 23:29.337
And while that is part
of what makes you so mighty,

23:29.421 --> 23:31.172
it can also make you vulnerable

23:31.256 --> 23:32.966
when you allow it to become
bullheadedness.

23:33.049 --> 23:34.884
This brings me no pleasure either.

23:35.343 --> 23:36.928
But you chose me as your leader,

23:37.011 --> 23:38.555
not to make popular decisions.

23:38.638 --> 23:39.681
But the tough ones.

23:39.764 --> 23:41.933
And what if the League
blows it? Then what, huh?

23:42.016 --> 23:45.019
We left our only clue to stopping
anything at the North Pole.

23:45.103 --> 23:45.937

[cell phone ringing]

23:53.570 --> 23:54.487
Ugh.

23:54.946 --> 23:56.030
[Supergirl grunts]

23:56.406 --> 23:57.240
Say, Kara,

23:57.323 --> 24:00.160
what was that about leaving
our only clue at the North Pole?

24:00.243 --> 24:03.246
You swiped my cousin's data crystals.

24:04.247 --> 24:05.373
[laughs]

24:06.041 --> 24:08.251
[euphoric music playing]

24:09.878 --> 24:11.337
[Superman] Bet your friends
are mad at you, huh?

24:12.380 --> 24:13.506
[Diana] Superman?

24:13.590 --> 24:14.883
This was from you?

24:14.966 --> 24:16.134
From him, actually.

24:16.676 --> 24:18.303
[mutters indistinctly]

24:18.386 --> 24:19.554
Join you!

24:19.637 --> 24:21.973
I am sorry, but I already belong
to a team.

24:22.265 --> 24:23.558
A team you dismissed!

24:23.641 --> 24:25.143
Look, I don't know you well,

24:25.393 --> 24:26.561
but I do know you'd never back down

24:26.644 --> 24:28.229
from a fight against evil.

24:28.313 --> 24:29.814
The only reason you stepped aside

24:29.898 --> 24:30.940
was to protect them.

24:31.232 --> 24:32.776
Because, at the end of the day,

24:33.193 --> 24:34.235
they are just kids.

24:34.319 --> 24:35.695
[mutters indistinctly]

24:35.779 --> 24:38.198
And how exactly am I different, Batman?

24:42.702 --> 24:43.870
[Superman] You're no kid.

24:43.953 --> 24:46.081
You got more combat expertise
than any of us.

24:46.581 --> 24:48.541
I have sworn to protect this world.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.585
And to stand up to any threat.

24:50.919 --> 24:51.961
But-- [sighs]

24:52.754 --> 24:54.631
But you're worried about
dissing your friends?

24:54.714 --> 24:56.132
This is bigger than that, Diana.

24:56.299 --> 24:57.175
If Luthor wins,

24:57.258 --> 24:59.135
a lot more than feelings
are gonna get hurt.

25:03.264 --> 25:04.808
<i>My precious son,</i>

25:05.016 --> 25:06.184
<i>Kal-El.</i>

25:06.267 --> 25:08.228
<i>There is much you must know</i>

25:08.311 --> 25:09.938
<i>about ancient Krypton.</i>

25:10.772 --> 25:11.689
Uh, Kara,

25:11.773 --> 25:13.942
I know this is like a piece
from your lost planet.

25:14.067 --> 25:16.903
So, please don't take this
the wrong way, but, snore.

25:17.612 --> 25:18.863
Zee, don't be rude!

25:19.364 --> 25:20.240
[machine whirring]

25:20.323 --> 25:21.825
But can we just skip
to the part about the amulet?

25:22.075 --> 25:23.451
[Jessica slurping]

25:23.535 --> 25:26.538
And for such
a technologically-advanced society,

25:26.621 --> 25:30.458
our home media playback systems
were surprisingly awful.

25:30.542 --> 25:34.796
<i>Then deglaze the pan</i>
<i>before adding the mushrooms.</i>

25:34.879 --> 25:37.340
<i>Cremini mushrooms</i>
<i>of planet Earth should be good.</i>

25:38.216 --> 25:40.468
You mean we gotta sit through
all of these?

25:40.593 --> 25:41.720
That'll take days.

25:42.095 --> 25:43.054
Not if I can get my data

25:43.138 --> 25:44.389
interface device up and running.

25:44.472 --> 25:46.391
I'll be able to download
everything in seconds.

25:46.683 --> 25:47.976
But if not, then, yes.

25:48.101 --> 25:49.310
It will take days.

25:50.145 --> 25:52.605
Uh. Isn't there at least a fast forward?

25:53.898 --> 25:56.860
Ugh, we weren't cave people, Barbara.

25:56.985 --> 25:58.695
[recording speeds up]

26:00.447 --> 26:03.324
<i>My sweet, beloved, cherished Kal-El.</i>

26:03.783 --> 26:06.036
Uh. And I thought my dad was mushy.

26:06.661 --> 26:10.123
<i>My role as Krypton's</i>
<i>lead ancient historian</i>

26:10.373 --> 26:13.626
<i>is just as important</i>

<i>My role as lead economic advisor--</i>

26:18.673 --> 26:20.633
[Jor-El] <i>Lead municipality specialist--</i>

[slams machine]

26:21.634 --> 26:23.178

26:23.261 --> 26:25.055
at Krypton's number one
fast food chain--

26:25.138 --> 26:26.097
[Supergirl shushes] Here it is.

26:27.015 --> 26:29.184
<i>Long believed to be merely a relic</i>

26:29.267 --> 26:30.643
<i>from a lost science,</i>

26:31.019 --> 26:33.271
<i>the Amulet of Cythonna is, in fact,</i>

26:33.646 --> 26:35.190
<i>something far more sinister.</i>

26:35.899 --> 26:38.109
<i>For as impossible as it may seem,</i>

26:38.193 --> 26:39.652
<i>the crystal within</i>

26:39.986 --> 26:41.404
<i>does, in fact, contain</i>

26:41.738 --> 26:45.116
<i>the essence of the Goddess of Darkness.</i>

26:45.658 --> 26:46.659
Wait...

26:46.868 --> 26:48.453
The actual goddess?

26:48.536 --> 26:49.454
<i>For eons,</i>

26:49.704 --> 26:50.997
<i>the imprisoned Cythonna</i>

26:51.081 --> 26:52.665
<i>has floated through the cosmos,</i>

26:52.749 --> 26:54.501
<i>in search of the one thing</i>

26:54.793 --> 26:56.211
<i>that may free her.</i>

26:56.294 --> 26:57.295
<i>Evil!</i>

26:57.879 --> 26:59.672
<i>She feeds on the souls</i>

26:59.756 --> 27:00.840
<i>of the wicked.</i>

27:00.924 --> 27:02.675
Like Luthor and the Legion of Doom.

27:02.842 --> 27:05.553
<i>The souls will become her servants</i>

27:05.762 --> 27:06.805
<i>and, in turn,</i>

27:07.263 --> 27:09.891
<i>create more evil for her to devour.</i>

27:11.017 --> 27:11.935
Ooh, I get it.

27:12.060 --> 27:13.436
Luthor isn't using Cythonna.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.979
She's using him.

27:15.522 --> 27:16.689
That's actually way worse.

27:16.773 --> 27:18.733
<i>Once she has become strong enough,</i>

27:19.150 --> 27:21.486
<i>-she will free herself from her prison.</i>
-[crystal shattering]

27:21.569 --> 27:22.654
-[all gasp]
<i>-She will assume</i>

27:22.737 --> 27:25.031
<i>a new Kryptonian vessel</i>

27:25.115 --> 27:27.075
<i>and reclaim the universe</i>

27:27.283 --> 27:28.535
<i>as her dominion.</i>

27:30.704 --> 27:33.707
The League has totally underestimated
what they're up against.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.793
[gasps] We have to warn Aquaman.

27:36.876 --> 27:38.128
I mean, the League.

27:38.253 --> 27:39.129
We have to warn the League.

27:39.713 --> 27:40.672
I'll call Diana.

27:41.381 --> 27:42.257
Kara, what do you think

27:42.340 --> 27:44.801
your uncle meant by
"a new Kryptonian vessel"?

27:45.385 --> 27:46.553
I don't know.

27:46.803 --> 27:48.763
Well, I guess we could listen
to some more of my uncle--

27:48.888 --> 27:50.348
-[Jessica] I was just curious.
-No way.

27:50.515 --> 27:51.725
[Batgirl] Guys.

27:51.808 --> 27:53.017
Diana's not answering.

27:55.937 --> 27:57.105
Hey, what's going on?

27:57.188 --> 27:59.190
I thought this was
supposed to be a crossover.

27:59.274 --> 28:00.608
Not that I'm complaining,

28:00.692 --> 28:02.736
but we haven't done anything here.

28:02.819 --> 28:04.571
While I am enjoying the escapades

28:04.654 --> 28:07.157
of the heroes
that are both girls and super,

28:07.240 --> 28:10.952
I do not see any evidence
of the crossing or the over.

28:11.036 --> 28:13.580
Yeah, and what's the big deal
about this crossover anyway?

28:13.663 --> 28:16.166
We already met the Super Hero Girls
a bunch of times.

28:16.249 --> 28:18.251
Youse were even there
one time, you remembers?

28:18.334 --> 28:20.253
That was on your show, you clowns.

28:20.503 --> 28:23.339
And while your show plays fast
and loose with internal logic,

28:23.423 --> 28:25.091
throws continuity out its window,

28:25.175 --> 28:28.261
and chooses poop jokes
over actual story,

28:28.553 --> 28:31.514
their show maintains
a coherent, cohesive narrative.

28:31.890 --> 28:34.142
Yeah, but how are their ratings?

28:34.851 --> 28:37.312
-Meh.
-[gasps] Wait a minute.

28:37.562 --> 28:38.396
That's it.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.607
We're not glomming onto
their popularity.

28:40.690 --> 28:42.150
They're glomming on to ours.

28:42.233 --> 28:43.151
[all gasp]

28:43.234 --> 28:45.278
I's, I's don't knows what to says.

28:45.528 --> 28:46.613
I feel so,

28:46.863 --> 28:48.531
so used right now.

28:49.199 --> 28:50.033
Indeed.

28:50.116 --> 28:51.993
Much like the bauble
that Beast Boy for used

28:52.077 --> 28:53.495
for the propping up of the TV.

28:53.578 --> 28:55.747
I too am feeling wedged into something,

28:55.830 --> 28:57.415
to which I do not belong.

28:57.499 --> 29:00.502
With the assigned, expressed
purpose of holding it up.

29:01.503 --> 29:03.380
This stinks, Control Freak.

29:03.463 --> 29:05.090
Oh, come now, Robin.

29:05.173 --> 29:06.216
I thought you'd be flattered

29:06.299 --> 29:07.884
by how much they think of your funny,

29:07.967 --> 29:10.136
action-packed, popular show.

29:10.220 --> 29:12.430
Oh. Well, you flatter us.

29:12.514 --> 29:14.265
It is pretty-- Hey!

29:14.432 --> 29:16.101
You can't blow me off with compliments.

29:16.184 --> 29:18.311
Yeah. I mean, if you don't
give us this event,

29:18.436 --> 29:19.687
at least you can give us something.

29:19.771 --> 29:21.106
Like a song, yo.

29:21.314 --> 29:22.440
Break it down, Cy.

29:23.274 --> 29:26.194
<i>You say you got us</i>
<i>In this crossover thang</i>

29:27.987 --> 29:29.781
<i>But this ain't how it's supposed to go</i>

29:29.948 --> 29:32.033
<i>It ain't supposed to be like this, y'all</i>

29:33.034 --> 29:35.245
<i>Where's the part where we</i>
<i>Meet the other team</i>

29:35.328 --> 29:37.163
<i>And then laughing</i>

29:37.831 --> 29:39.582
<i>And the dumb misunderstandings</i>

29:39.666 --> 29:42.502
<i>-That bring us to blows</i>
<i>-Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

29:42.585 --> 29:44.963
<i>-Don't crossover my heart</i>
<i>-Don't do it</i>

29:45.046 --> 29:47.257
<i>Don't crossover my heart</i>

29:47.340 --> 29:49.134
<i>We must find the compare and contrast</i>

29:49.217 --> 29:51.886
<i>-To our counterparts</i>
<i>-Yeah</i>

29:51.970 --> 29:54.431
<i>Don't forget the obligatory romance</i>

29:54.514 --> 29:56.641
<i>-Between two crossed hearts</i>
<i>-Don't push it, Rob</i>

29:56.975 --> 29:59.310
<i>Don't crossover my heart</i>

29:59.394 --> 30:01.187
<i>Don't crossover</i>

30:01.271 --> 30:02.188
[Control Freak screams] Stop!

30:02.856 --> 30:05.108
And you wonder why you're not
featured in this event more.

30:05.191 --> 30:06.234
[scoffs]

30:11.990 --> 30:13.158
My trap has been set.

30:13.783 --> 30:15.660
Any remaining heroes
who oppose me will be crushed.

30:16.286 --> 30:17.829
But what of the Kryptonian?

30:18.747 --> 30:21.082
Look, I haven't forgotten your request.

30:22.459 --> 30:24.836
Perhaps I'll honor it. If it suits me.

30:25.003 --> 30:27.839
[dramatic music playing]

30:27.922 --> 30:29.466
And it does suit me.

30:29.883 --> 30:31.801
The Kryptonian you require
will arrive shortly.

30:35.889 --> 30:37.182
[cracks]

30:38.808 --> 30:43.063
The Legion's evil is making me stronger
by the second.

30:43.146 --> 30:45.065
Soon, I shall be free.

30:48.902 --> 30:50.945
I don't see any sign of Diana up here.

30:51.821 --> 30:53.573
I'm coming up empty too.

30:53.907 --> 30:55.367
Ugh, we better regroup.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.744
So the last any of us heard from her was

30:57.827 --> 30:59.245
that group text from an hour ago.

31:00.246 --> 31:01.081
Right!

31:01.164 --> 31:02.624
The one that just said, "I'm in"?

31:02.791 --> 31:04.334
Yeah, but in what?

31:04.793 --> 31:06.044
Actually, looking at this again,

31:06.127 --> 31:07.796
I think the real question might be,

31:08.505 --> 31:11.591
who are all these other numbers
she included on that text?

31:11.674 --> 31:14.260
I just assumed it was another one
of Diana's tech goofs,

31:14.344 --> 31:16.554
because I don't
recognize any of the numbers.

31:16.638 --> 31:17.597
[Supergirl] I do.

31:17.680 --> 31:18.848
This is Clark's.

31:19.015 --> 31:21.184
And this one comes up as Jon Stewart.

31:23.395 --> 31:25.271
Batman's emergency line is here too.

31:26.689 --> 31:28.942
So, maybe including these other numbers

31:29.317 --> 31:30.485
wasn't a mistake.

31:30.777 --> 31:33.238
But including ours was.

31:34.364 --> 31:36.282
And when Diana said "I'm in",

31:36.700 --> 31:37.534
she meant...

31:37.617 --> 31:39.160
In the Justice League.

31:41.204 --> 31:42.288
Just curious.

31:42.372 --> 31:43.748
That would make this last number

31:43.832 --> 31:45.041
Aquaman's, right? [giggles]

31:47.877 --> 31:49.838
[dramatic music playing]

31:49.921 --> 31:52.882
Batman's traced the amulet's radiation
signature to this swamp.

31:52.966 --> 31:54.592
<i>We should be closing in</i>
<i>on the Legion's headquarters</i>

31:54.676 --> 31:55.593
<i>any second now.</i>

31:55.927 --> 31:57.846
Ah, about time, man.

31:57.929 --> 31:59.305
That dude can build anything
with that ring.

31:59.389 --> 32:01.641
Try a little lumbar support
next time. Am I right?

32:03.643 --> 32:05.437
Oh, okay. Another serious one, huh?

32:05.603 --> 32:06.479
I am sorry?

32:06.563 --> 32:07.772
No, no, it's cool.

32:07.856 --> 32:10.442
Just between Sergeant Green-never-grin,

32:10.525 --> 32:12.610
Dracula man and the Ego Scout,

32:12.694 --> 32:15.155
[whispering] this team's got
the personality of a sea sponge.

32:16.114 --> 32:18.658
I do not know this
Sergeant Green-never grin.

32:19.743 --> 32:21.619
[chuckles] All right.

32:21.745 --> 32:24.080
Well, none of these guys
has a sense of humor.

32:24.289 --> 32:26.207
[Superman over radio] <i>All right, team.</i>
<i>Let's go over the plan.</i>

32:26.374 --> 32:28.043
Superman will lead the direct strike.

32:28.168 --> 32:29.878
While Batman uses the distraction

32:29.961 --> 32:31.504
to sneak in and steal the amulet.

32:31.713 --> 32:35.175
[muttering]

32:36.551 --> 32:37.385
I'm gonna be honest here,

32:37.469 --> 32:39.387
I am not completely sure
what he just said,

32:39.471 --> 32:41.097
but I think it had something to do with

32:41.181 --> 32:43.433
using the amulet
to free the other dudes?

32:43.516 --> 32:44.809
[muttering]

32:44.893 --> 32:46.394
All right, and then destroy the amulet.

32:46.478 --> 32:47.645
[laughs] Right.

32:47.729 --> 32:48.980
Is it just me, or is anyone else

32:49.064 --> 32:50.398
having trouble understanding
the bat guy?

32:50.607 --> 32:52.192
'Cause I'd be surprised
if it was just me

32:52.275 --> 32:53.943
'cause I can understand jellyfish.

32:54.527 --> 32:55.653
[Superman over the radio] <i>Got a visual.</i>

32:55.737 --> 32:57.614
[dramatic music playing]

32:59.574 --> 33:01.409
<i>And it looks like everyone's home.</i>

33:02.827 --> 33:04.287
[explosion]

33:04.537 --> 33:05.830
Game's over, Luthor.

33:18.802 --> 33:19.886
[shatters]

33:19.969 --> 33:21.346
Yep, it's a phony.

33:21.471 --> 33:23.390
Just something I whipped up
to get your attention.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.683
I call it a trans-thermal transmitter,

33:25.767 --> 33:27.560
but you can call it a trap.

33:31.898 --> 33:33.066
[metal clanks]

33:34.359 --> 33:37.237
And you were
supposed to be the smart one.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.196
All right, team.

33:39.239 --> 33:41.241
[dramatic music playing]

33:41.366 --> 33:42.367
This shouldn't take long.

33:44.077 --> 33:45.036
[grunts]

33:49.374 --> 33:50.208
Huh?

33:53.378 --> 33:55.463
-[Wonder Woman grunts]
-[growling]

33:55.588 --> 33:56.589
Uh.

33:59.467 --> 34:02.637
[suspenseful music playing]

34:03.304 --> 34:04.139
[Diana] Huh?

34:05.390 --> 34:06.307
Holograms?

34:06.725 --> 34:08.309
-What have you--
-[Superman] Okay, be cool.

34:08.393 --> 34:10.395
We may have walked into--
[grunts]

34:14.899 --> 34:15.900
Whatever that thing is,

34:15.984 --> 34:17.360
-it's made of--
-[Luthor] Kryptonite.

34:21.156 --> 34:22.614
[cackling]

34:27.036 --> 34:28.913
I have what I need. Dispose of the rest.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.708
Stand strong, League!

34:49.641 --> 34:50.601
Hey!

34:50.685 --> 34:51.811
That's not cool, man.

34:56.900 --> 34:59.235
So not cool, man.

35:04.365 --> 35:07.160
[giggling] Where are your
little friends?

35:07.452 --> 35:09.412
This won't be the same without them.

35:09.496 --> 35:11.206
They're no threat to us now.

35:11.289 --> 35:14.542
Especially without their
precious captain.

35:15.168 --> 35:18.046
Hold up! This one's mine.

35:18.129 --> 35:19.631
[both grunting]

35:19.964 --> 35:22.008
[grunts] Harley Quinn?

35:22.175 --> 35:24.594
-I will not spare--
-Ah, zip it would ya?

35:24.761 --> 35:26.346
-[grunts]
-[Diana] What is this?

35:26.429 --> 35:27.931
-[hinges creaking]
-[exhales]

35:28.056 --> 35:29.682
These guys are out of control,

35:29.766 --> 35:31.518
and they're getting eviler
by the second.

35:31.601 --> 35:33.186
You need to get Babs
and your pals together

35:33.269 --> 35:34.270
and save the day,

35:34.354 --> 35:36.231
like you jerks always do.

35:37.482 --> 35:40.235
Harleen, I am afraid that is unlikely.

35:40.402 --> 35:41.569
For you see, I have--

35:41.653 --> 35:44.739
Ain't that something. I don't care, go.

35:45.281 --> 35:46.783
-But--
-[door slams]

35:47.158 --> 35:49.828
Uh... Ra-koom!

35:52.914 --> 35:56.334
Uh, welp, add another one
to the old Phantom Zone.

35:56.876 --> 35:58.878
[exclaims]

36:06.886 --> 36:10.682
So, I take it things aren't
going well on the other side.

36:12.183 --> 36:13.393
I can't believe the Legion of Doom

36:13.476 --> 36:15.311
took out a team
of heavy hitters like you.

36:15.437 --> 36:16.855
I can't believe you formed your own team

36:16.938 --> 36:19.065
and didn't call it, "Super Friends."

36:19.149 --> 36:20.525
[scoffs] Told you.

36:20.608 --> 36:23.653
And I can't believe
you didn't ask Hal Jordan

36:23.737 --> 36:26.156
to be your Green Lantern. I mean, Jon,

36:26.281 --> 36:27.866
you're cool and all, but...

36:29.451 --> 36:30.994
[whines] Come on!

36:32.037 --> 36:33.955
Hal Jordan!

36:34.664 --> 36:36.166
Unbelievable.

36:36.249 --> 36:37.625
She sold us out.

36:37.709 --> 36:39.502
Look, we're all mad at Diana,

36:39.586 --> 36:41.588
but we have to trust her decision.

36:41.713 --> 36:42.881
Tell 'em, Jess.

36:42.964 --> 36:46.301
Honestly, right now, I don't know.

36:46.384 --> 36:48.970
All my life, people have been
selling me short.

36:49.137 --> 36:51.097
But, Diana?

36:51.181 --> 36:53.892
I'm sure she's got
the team's best interests at heart.

36:53.975 --> 36:55.435
Face it, Babs.

36:55.518 --> 36:56.770
She dumped us.

36:58.229 --> 37:00.690
No, she loves us more than anything.

37:00.774 --> 37:02.025
I mean, after what she went through,

37:02.108 --> 37:03.401
with me and Harley Quinn alone...

37:03.568 --> 37:05.028
[grunting]

37:05.528 --> 37:07.530
What about you and Harley?

37:08.031 --> 37:09.949
Oh, did I not mention

37:10.033 --> 37:11.743
Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel

37:11.826 --> 37:13.370
are actually one in the same?

37:13.578 --> 37:15.163
I mean, saying the names together,

37:15.246 --> 37:17.040
it's kind of obvious,
so you probably already

37:17.123 --> 37:18.625
figured it out. Right?

37:18.792 --> 37:20.752
You and Diana knew

37:20.835 --> 37:23.463
your bestie was a super villain
and you didn't tell us?

37:23.546 --> 37:25.965
Technically, ex-bestie.

37:26.216 --> 37:28.760
She threw me off a train, Barbara!

37:29.886 --> 37:32.180
-[Jessica] Zee?
-[gasps]

37:33.014 --> 37:35.392
Babs, I... [sighs]

37:35.475 --> 37:36.476
Forget it.

37:36.684 --> 37:37.894
I quit.

37:38.603 --> 37:40.105
Yup, me too.

37:41.147 --> 37:42.315
What do we do?

37:42.399 --> 37:43.775
What is there to do?

37:43.858 --> 37:45.860
The League is handling the bad guys,

37:46.611 --> 37:48.571
so, I guess...

37:49.656 --> 37:50.865
We go home.

37:55.912 --> 37:58.289
<i>Good evening. Lex Luthor here.</i>

37:58.373 --> 38:00.208
<i>You know me</i>
<i>as the entrepreneurial genius</i>

38:00.291 --> 38:01.626
<i>who built a billion-dollar empire</i>

38:01.710 --> 38:02.544
<i>with nothing more than his</i>

38:02.627 --> 38:05.046
<i>preternatural savvy</i>
<i>and indomitable drive.</i>

38:05.130 --> 38:07.424
Today, I am allowing
these gifts to serve

38:07.507 --> 38:08.967
a much higher purpose.

38:09.050 --> 38:11.761
But first, I'd like to introduce
you to some friends of mine.

38:12.512 --> 38:14.723
The Legion of Doom.

38:15.849 --> 38:17.183
[all gasping]

38:17.267 --> 38:18.184
<i>I know, I know.</i>

38:18.268 --> 38:19.686
<i>Pretty cool name. Am I right?</i>

38:20.270 --> 38:22.063
Anyway, about my new higher purpose.

38:22.522 --> 38:23.648
I, Lex Luthor

38:23.732 --> 38:25.150
<i>and my Legion of Doom,</i>

38:25.358 --> 38:28.027
<i>are going to take over the world.</i>

38:29.362 --> 38:31.197
<i>You're saying, "Come on, Lex.</i>

38:31.281 --> 38:32.991
<i>How are you going</i>
<i>to take over the world?"</i>

38:33.450 --> 38:34.367
<i>Simple.</i>

38:36.453 --> 38:37.954
<i>You're gonna give it to us.</i>

38:38.246 --> 38:40.290
<i>Cast your eyes skyward, folks.</i>

38:40.373 --> 38:43.084
[machine whirring]

38:46.463 --> 38:49.299
All right, Cythonna,
show us what you can really do.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.895
[people murmuring]

39:04.814 --> 39:07.067
<i>So, this is when I say,</i>

39:07.150 --> 39:09.527
<i>you have 24 hours to meet our demands.</i>

39:09.652 --> 39:10.695
[crowd gasping]

39:11.196 --> 39:13.114
Oh, my gosh. I forgot the best part.

39:13.364 --> 39:15.367
Don't look for any clowns in tights
to save you.

39:15.533 --> 39:16.743
We've gotten rid of them all.

39:17.243 --> 39:18.995
Well, the important ones, anyway.

39:19.371 --> 39:20.955
[all laughing]

39:21.039 --> 39:23.708
You now have 23 hours and 59 minutes.

39:29.464 --> 39:32.133
Since when you become
the brooding type of bat?

39:32.217 --> 39:34.427
[growls] You picked the wrong time
to mess with...

39:34.677 --> 39:35.637
Harleen?

39:35.804 --> 39:37.597
-Where is the...
-Jester get-up?

39:37.722 --> 39:39.182
Ah, taking a break.

39:39.641 --> 39:43.103
Turns out I'm a big fan
of causing chaos,

39:43.311 --> 39:44.979
but destroying the world?

39:45.063 --> 39:46.564
Eh, not so much.

39:46.815 --> 39:48.066
You quit the Legion?

39:48.691 --> 39:50.735
Does this mean
you're not a bad guy anymore?

39:50.860 --> 39:53.363
Let's just say, I'm taking a sabbatical.

39:53.613 --> 39:54.489
Really?

39:55.198 --> 39:57.242
Well, you couldn't have
quit at a better time.

39:57.450 --> 40:00.120
A group of A-list heroes like
Wonder Woman is about to kick their...

40:00.370 --> 40:01.287
What?

40:01.371 --> 40:02.914
You don't know, do you?

40:02.997 --> 40:03.873
Know what?

40:03.957 --> 40:06.710
Eesh, Babs! Current events much?

40:07.460 --> 40:08.378
[cell phone ringing]

40:09.546 --> 40:12.090
[Karen] <i>Babs, emergency</i>
<i>at the junkyard. Hurry!</i>

40:17.053 --> 40:18.513
Bumblebee, I'm here.

40:18.638 --> 40:19.681
Where are you?

40:19.764 --> 40:21.182
Bumblebee, are you okay?

40:24.227 --> 40:25.395
Hmph!

40:26.354 --> 40:27.981
You got Bumblebee's distress call too?

40:28.106 --> 40:29.357
[sighs] Harley Quinn.

40:29.941 --> 40:31.359
What did you do with her?

40:31.443 --> 40:33.236
Hold up, Zee. She's with me.

40:33.361 --> 40:35.697
And that changes what exactly, Babs?

40:35.780 --> 40:38.032
Whoa, easy! For once,

40:38.199 --> 40:40.410
this girl's not with anybody.

40:40.493 --> 40:42.245
Even less reason to trust you.

40:42.370 --> 40:43.705
Quit arguing!

40:43.830 --> 40:45.331
We've got to find Bumblebee.

40:45.415 --> 40:46.541
[Bumblebee] I'm right here.

40:46.624 --> 40:48.251
I faked an emergency call.

40:48.334 --> 40:50.086
-Wait. What?
-[Zatanna] So not cool.

40:50.378 --> 40:52.630
Because we got to talk.

40:52.964 --> 40:53.882
Look.

40:53.965 --> 40:56.843
I know we have different ideas of what
being a superhero means,

40:56.926 --> 40:59.179
and honestly, that's what makes us...

40:59.637 --> 41:01.598
made us, such a good team.

41:02.932 --> 41:04.726
But what made us a great team

41:04.976 --> 41:06.019
is that we always agreed

41:06.102 --> 41:08.021
on the one thing a superhero isn't.

41:08.730 --> 41:09.647
Selfish.

41:13.193 --> 41:15.695
We've been putting our own issues
ahead of the greater good.

41:16.154 --> 41:18.656
Whether it's a big shadow
only you can see,

41:18.907 --> 41:21.368
or questioning the virtue
of someone you love,

41:21.576 --> 41:23.870
or questioning the virtue in yourself.

41:24.496 --> 41:26.081
Or maybe you're just afraid

41:26.164 --> 41:28.041
to tell your friends
to be quiet and listen

41:28.166 --> 41:29.793
when they're making a huge mistake.

41:30.335 --> 41:32.670
Well, it's time to get over ourselves.

41:32.921 --> 41:34.881
So, be quiet and listen!

41:35.882 --> 41:37.509
The League may have made a big mistake

41:37.634 --> 41:39.302
by underestimating the Legion of Doom.

41:39.594 --> 41:41.888
But by claiming victory
without even considering us,

41:42.097 --> 41:43.973
the bad guys made
an even bigger mistake.

41:44.557 --> 41:47.477
They underestimated
the Super Hero Girls.

41:47.644 --> 41:49.312
Time to kick some Legion butt.

41:49.396 --> 41:50.438
[all] Yeah.

41:50.730 --> 41:52.399
[Harley] A word of advice.

41:52.482 --> 41:54.526
If you're planning to storm
the Hall of Doom,

41:54.692 --> 41:55.944
bring hand towels.

41:56.194 --> 41:58.029
The restroom dryers are the pits!

41:58.571 --> 41:59.989
Wait. Harleen.

42:00.073 --> 42:01.241
You're not going to help?

42:01.408 --> 42:03.868
I said I didn't want
to destroy the world.

42:03.952 --> 42:06.246
Never said nothing about saving it.

42:07.330 --> 42:08.748
[sighs] Forget her.

42:08.873 --> 42:09.958
We got work to do.

42:10.166 --> 42:11.960
First, we got to get our leader back.

42:12.085 --> 42:13.503
Now, just a minute.

42:13.670 --> 42:15.171
She made a mistake, Kara.

42:15.255 --> 42:16.214
One mistake.

42:16.423 --> 42:18.717
How many of yours has she let slide?

42:20.301 --> 42:21.469
Let's go get her.

42:21.803 --> 42:24.139
But how? Isn't she in the Phantom Zone?

42:24.556 --> 42:25.432
Seriously?

42:25.515 --> 42:27.350
Have any of you been checking
your phones, at all?

42:27.434 --> 42:28.893
-We've had a lot going on.
-Lost my charger.

42:28.977 --> 42:30.729
Only to check the fashion month feed.

42:31.312 --> 42:32.147
[sighs]

42:35.066 --> 42:36.234
<i>My beloved sisters.</i>

42:36.776 --> 42:37.902
<i>I have wronged you.</i>

42:37.986 --> 42:40.321
I mean, it's cool she figured out
how to send a video,

42:40.405 --> 42:42.699
but you think she'd have realized
her thumb was covering the scree--

42:42.824 --> 42:44.200
Babs, listen.

42:44.826 --> 42:46.453
[sighs] <i>I know now,</i>

42:46.661 --> 42:48.163
<i>that in trying to protect you,</i>

42:48.580 --> 42:50.415
<i>I only hurt you, deeply.</i>

42:54.502 --> 42:55.879
And because of this failure,

42:56.046 --> 42:58.757
I have humbly returned
to Themyscira, Mother.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.051
There is a first for everything.

43:01.134 --> 43:03.803
You of all people know
this is not my first failure,

43:04.220 --> 43:06.598
but it is my greatest.

43:06.681 --> 43:09.059
I was referring to your tears.

43:09.142 --> 43:12.187
I cannot recall
ever seeing you cry, my child.

43:12.312 --> 43:13.146
[Diana grunts]

43:13.605 --> 43:16.524
As your mother,
I did everything in my power

43:16.608 --> 43:19.194
to ensure failure never befall you.

43:19.319 --> 43:21.029
I know, Mother. Thank you.

43:21.112 --> 43:24.491
However, the one lesson I never taught

43:24.574 --> 43:26.576
was what to do when it does.

43:27.285 --> 43:28.953
We all fail, Diana.

43:29.329 --> 43:30.997
And that was my failure.

43:31.247 --> 43:33.917
One we will now rectify.

43:34.167 --> 43:35.043
We?

43:35.168 --> 43:38.421
Lucky for you, we're all really familiar
with screwing up.

43:38.671 --> 43:41.132
Yeah, we can give you the crash course.

43:41.299 --> 43:42.425
[all shouting]

43:44.677 --> 43:46.513
[sighs] We'll take it from here, Poly.

43:48.431 --> 43:49.349
Sisters.

43:49.432 --> 43:51.226
You are here. I thought you...

43:51.309 --> 43:52.227
Broke up?

43:52.310 --> 43:53.269
We did.

43:53.353 --> 43:55.480
But Karen had a really inspiring speech.

43:55.605 --> 43:57.315
Ooh, do the speech thing again, Karen.

43:57.399 --> 43:59.609
It was more of an in-the-moment thing.

43:59.734 --> 44:01.820
But we did watch your thumb apology.

44:02.070 --> 44:03.363
And thanks to Jess' ring,

44:03.488 --> 44:05.323
we got here a lot faster
than your row-boat.

44:05.573 --> 44:08.034
Now, come on.
There's no more time for hugs.

44:08.952 --> 44:11.121
Well, maybe one more.

44:11.204 --> 44:12.622
[all chuckling]

44:12.914 --> 44:14.249
All right. Diana,

44:14.416 --> 44:15.667
let's save the world.

44:15.834 --> 44:17.377
You still trust me to lead you?

44:17.961 --> 44:19.129
More than ever, D.

44:29.222 --> 44:30.640
With no other option,

44:30.932 --> 44:34.144
the United Council of Nations
cedes its power

44:34.352 --> 44:35.854
to the Legion of Doom.

44:35.979 --> 44:37.230
[all cheering]

44:39.399 --> 44:40.734
We make a good team.

44:40.817 --> 44:43.027
Not bad for a Kryptonian.

44:43.903 --> 44:44.988
What?

44:45.071 --> 44:47.615
I think we're past any delusions

44:47.741 --> 44:51.619
of this being an actual partnership,
aren't we, Alexander?

44:51.995 --> 44:53.288
[sighs] What on earth are you...

44:53.371 --> 44:54.539
Stop talking.

44:57.751 --> 45:00.837
With my power near its peak,
it's time you assume the role

45:00.920 --> 45:03.173
I'd always intended for you
and your Legion.

45:03.673 --> 45:04.883
Servitude.

45:05.508 --> 45:07.302
I await your command, Cythonna.

45:07.886 --> 45:09.220
Funny thing is,

45:09.387 --> 45:13.224
you've been serving me since the moment
you touched my amulet.

45:13.308 --> 45:17.437
You were just too blinded by your own
greed and ambition to realize it.

45:18.021 --> 45:18.855
So blind.

45:19.355 --> 45:20.732
What will you have me do?

45:21.024 --> 45:23.109
Ugh! I shall soon be free.

45:23.401 --> 45:25.612
I want to see my new Kryptonian body.

45:35.914 --> 45:37.290
What was that?

45:37.374 --> 45:38.291
The Kryptonian.

45:38.458 --> 45:39.376
Just like...

45:39.459 --> 45:40.377
I told you,

45:40.502 --> 45:43.421
I needed the world's
strongest Kryptonian.

45:43.505 --> 45:44.547
That was.

45:45.006 --> 45:46.925
Wait. You mean--

45:47.008 --> 45:50.178
Unlike that one,
Kara's strength is yet to peak.

45:50.303 --> 45:52.680
Her strong will alone
makes her far more suitable

45:52.764 --> 45:55.308
for divinity than this useless thing.

45:57.227 --> 45:58.061
Wait!

45:58.686 --> 46:00.355
He may not be completely useless.

46:04.234 --> 46:07.904
Our only chance is to catch the Legion
off guard with a surprise offensive.

46:07.987 --> 46:10.031
Like going by these schematics
Batman gave you,

46:10.323 --> 46:11.908
I don't see any way to sneak in.

46:12.033 --> 46:13.910
But maybe we could sneak out.

46:18.915 --> 46:20.291
Hey, what gives? It's empty.

46:20.375 --> 46:21.418
Sorry.

46:21.501 --> 46:23.002
I downloaded the data
to figure out a way

46:23.086 --> 46:25.130
to get to the Phantom Zone
and rescue our friends.

46:25.296 --> 46:28.425
You mean, you think you can create
our own dimensional portal?

46:28.508 --> 46:29.342
Exactly.

46:29.592 --> 46:31.886
But now I'm thinking we can create
something even better.

46:31.970 --> 46:33.930
Whoa! A dimensional waterslide?

46:34.139 --> 46:37.684
So, we know Cythonna's magic has
unlimited access to the Phantom Zone,

46:37.851 --> 46:39.561
which makes the amulet like a hub.

46:39.686 --> 46:40.687
Theoretically speaking,

46:40.770 --> 46:42.397
it correlates with what
quantum physicists call

46:42.480 --> 46:43.982
a Hamiltonian density matrix.

46:44.232 --> 46:45.066
Here, look.

46:45.233 --> 46:48.069
Bottom line, a way in is a way out.

46:48.278 --> 46:50.155
Wait. I see what Karen's thinking.

46:50.405 --> 46:52.615
You figure out a way to travel
to the Phantom Zone,

46:52.699 --> 46:53.616
grab our friends,

46:53.783 --> 46:55.493
but then come back through the amulet.

46:55.577 --> 46:57.829
Which would put us smack-dab
in the middle of

46:57.912 --> 46:59.330
the Hall of Doom.

46:59.414 --> 47:01.875
With all of the heroes in full force.

47:02.042 --> 47:03.877
Talk about a sneak attack.

47:03.960 --> 47:05.503
Do you really think you could do it?

47:05.587 --> 47:07.714
No, but you can.

47:07.797 --> 47:08.840
Uh, come again?

47:08.923 --> 47:11.009
I can figure out how to navigate
through dimensions

47:11.134 --> 47:12.177
but without the right tech,

47:12.260 --> 47:14.554
we have to travel the same way
Cythonna does.

47:14.763 --> 47:15.930
With magic.

47:16.639 --> 47:18.975
Well, why didn't you say so?
I'm your girl.

47:19.726 --> 47:21.394
[Bumblebee] Dark magic.

47:21.644 --> 47:24.230
Oh, dark... [chuckles nervously]

47:24.397 --> 47:26.941
Yeah, I mean, I guess.

47:27.442 --> 47:28.693
[Cythonna whispering] <i>Kara.</i>

47:29.277 --> 47:31.654
[Cythonna whispering] <i>Kara Zor-El.</i>

47:32.197 --> 47:34.282
[Cythonna] Kara Zor-El of Krypton.

47:41.956 --> 47:43.333
Cythonna.

47:43.625 --> 47:46.711
I apologize if I interrupted you
and your friends

47:46.836 --> 47:49.964
planning what promises to be
an adorable yet futile attack.

47:50.298 --> 47:51.341
What do you want?

47:51.966 --> 47:54.427
Simple. I want you to come get...

47:54.969 --> 47:55.887
Him.

47:55.970 --> 47:57.055
Kal. No!

47:57.138 --> 47:58.139
[Cythonna] Want him?

47:58.723 --> 48:00.183
Come get him.

48:01.101 --> 48:03.645
Goddess or not, I swear I will beat you.

48:04.312 --> 48:05.814
Kara.

48:05.897 --> 48:07.607
Kara, are you okay?

48:07.690 --> 48:09.776
Listen, Diana,
you go rescue our friends.

48:10.193 --> 48:11.653
I need to face Cythonna.

48:11.736 --> 48:13.988
What? Kara, I must insist--

48:14.072 --> 48:16.449
I know. I know. You think
I'm being my bullheaded self,

48:16.533 --> 48:18.410
and I am.

48:18.493 --> 48:20.453
But they have Clark.

48:20.537 --> 48:21.621
-Then we should--
-Diana,

48:21.746 --> 48:25.041
I am asking you to trust me now.

48:29.295 --> 48:30.755
[computer trilling, beeping]

48:31.172 --> 48:33.007
[Bumblebee] Okay. I think
we're ready to go.

48:34.342 --> 48:36.469
-Where's Kara?
-Supergirl will meet us there.

48:37.011 --> 48:39.097
Trust she knows
what she's doing, sisters.

48:39.222 --> 48:40.140
I do.

48:40.390 --> 48:41.725
Now, let us away.

48:41.891 --> 48:44.936
All aboard The Phantom Zone Express.

48:45.061 --> 48:46.020
Bubble us up, Jess.

48:50.817 --> 48:52.610
Okay, Zee. Go time.

48:52.694 --> 48:56.322
All right. Dark, creepy and often
uncontrollable magic coming up.

48:56.406 --> 48:57.407
It's okay, Zee.

48:57.490 --> 48:58.533
You got this.

49:00.118 --> 49:01.619
[indistinct muttering]

49:05.540 --> 49:07.167
[all screaming]

49:10.920 --> 49:12.547
I never thought I would say this, but,

49:12.714 --> 49:15.800
burritos for lunch was a horrible idea.

49:15.884 --> 49:19.679
Zee, each off-shoot tunnel is a gateway
to a different dimension.

49:19.804 --> 49:21.765
The Phantom Zone is coming up.

49:21.848 --> 49:23.475
Now, make sure you...

49:23.600 --> 49:24.851
[Dark Zee] <i>You're gonna blow it.</i>

49:24.976 --> 49:26.811
Stop it. Stop.

49:27.145 --> 49:29.564
I can do this. I can.

49:29.647 --> 49:31.316
You don't seem so sure of yourself.

49:31.399 --> 49:32.817
How can you be sure of anything

49:32.901 --> 49:34.235
when you're not even sure
of who you are?

49:34.319 --> 49:35.904
You're nothing. A nobody.

49:35.987 --> 49:36.863
No one loves you.

49:36.988 --> 49:38.323
-You are a freak.
-A phoney.

49:38.406 --> 49:39.449
A monster.

49:39.532 --> 49:41.201
No wonder your mom left.

49:41.451 --> 49:42.660
[shouting] Stop it.

49:43.912 --> 49:45.288
[all screaming]

49:49.000 --> 49:50.710
Did I do it?

49:50.877 --> 49:53.797
I'm not sure, but I think so.

49:54.589 --> 49:56.257
Sisters, at the ready.

49:57.050 --> 49:59.803
Weird. Awfully bright
for a Phantom Zone.

50:01.721 --> 50:04.891
Are we sure
we're in the right dimension?

50:06.393 --> 50:07.894
No, I'm not sure.

50:08.269 --> 50:09.687
The dark magic...

50:09.896 --> 50:11.064
It's okay, Zee.

50:11.314 --> 50:14.359
I mean, we don't know
that this isn't the Phantom Zone.

50:14.734 --> 50:16.111
Yeah, of course it is.

50:16.361 --> 50:18.446
Now, let's find the other heroes.

50:18.780 --> 50:20.240
Uh, I see heroes,

50:20.573 --> 50:23.118
but I don't think they're the ones
we're looking for.

50:24.828 --> 50:26.579
BB, you seeing what I'm seeing?

50:28.039 --> 50:30.166
It's the Super Hero Girls, yo.

50:33.294 --> 50:36.923
Oh, yes, the team
I wish to be the member of,

50:37.006 --> 50:41.428
but refuse to say as such so as to spare
the feelings of my current team.

50:46.015 --> 50:48.893
We actually have a door, but whatever.

50:50.937 --> 50:53.940
Oh, come on.
This literally happened yesterday.

50:54.023 --> 50:57.902
You mean, we've already been
crossed over and no one told us?

50:58.361 --> 51:00.864
Well, the hits just keep on coming.

51:01.531 --> 51:02.574
Just watch.

51:02.949 --> 51:04.492
You'll play a very important role

51:04.659 --> 51:05.827
in this story before its end.

51:05.910 --> 51:07.704
Trust me! [chuckles]

51:08.913 --> 51:09.873
Hmm.

51:09.956 --> 51:12.292
We apologize, but do we know you?

51:12.625 --> 51:13.793
[laughs]

51:14.002 --> 51:15.336
Good one, Wonder lady.

51:15.420 --> 51:17.255
I didn't realize you were the funny one.

51:17.338 --> 51:19.215
It's like you're the 'me' of your team.

51:19.299 --> 51:21.259
Come on, guys. It's us.

51:21.342 --> 51:22.886
The Teen Titans.

51:23.011 --> 51:24.637
You mean, the tween titans.

51:25.013 --> 51:26.389
Didn't we babysit you once?

51:26.598 --> 51:27.432
"Babysit"?

51:28.224 --> 51:30.685
Do I in any way look like a baby to you?

51:32.270 --> 51:33.354
[Beast Boy] Oh, I gets it.

51:33.563 --> 51:35.065
They are good enough for our show,

51:35.148 --> 51:36.858
but the moments we shows up
in their thing,

51:36.941 --> 51:38.693
it's all like, "What's going on?

51:38.818 --> 51:39.819
Who's are you?"

51:39.944 --> 51:40.904
Hey, that's right!

51:40.987 --> 51:42.530
Continuity snobs.

51:42.697 --> 51:44.991
Guys, I think I know what's going on.

51:45.367 --> 51:48.328
We've ended up in some kind
of parallel universe.

51:48.912 --> 51:50.747
One that's similar to ours.

51:50.997 --> 51:53.333
But with way larger heads.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.876
And hands.

51:54.959 --> 51:56.336
Our hands are very large too

51:57.879 --> 51:59.381
So I guess I did mess up.

52:00.590 --> 52:04.094
As fellow heroes, you can appreciate
the gravity of our mission,

52:04.177 --> 52:07.389
for we face a crisis
of catastrophic proportions.

52:07.472 --> 52:09.349
[giggling]

52:09.432 --> 52:11.559
Forgive us if we seem underwhelmed

52:11.726 --> 52:14.354
but we eat crises of
catastrophic proportions

52:14.521 --> 52:15.647
for breakfast.

52:15.730 --> 52:18.441
They're called jalapeno waffle bombs,
yo. Ha-ha!

52:18.691 --> 52:21.194
Okay, Super Hero Girls, we'll help you.

52:21.528 --> 52:23.738
Really, we just need a couple
of spare computer parts.

52:23.822 --> 52:25.490
But I'm only saying this once.

52:25.573 --> 52:27.367
My world. My rules.

52:27.575 --> 52:28.827
I call the shots.

52:28.910 --> 52:30.787
I say jump, you say, "I already did

52:30.912 --> 52:33.289
because I'm so in tune
with your amazing leadership skills,

52:33.373 --> 52:35.625
I knew what you were going to ask me
before you could even ask it."

52:35.750 --> 52:37.794
[inhales deeply] Are we clear?

52:38.211 --> 52:39.087
Oh, wow.

52:39.170 --> 52:40.964
Is it possible that
you're even more annoying

52:41.131 --> 52:42.424
than the Robin in my universe?

52:49.806 --> 52:50.890
I'm pretty sure I can fix it.

52:50.974 --> 52:51.850
True. True.

52:51.933 --> 52:53.184
But let me hit you with this.

52:53.268 --> 52:55.729
Why fix when you can upgrade?

52:55.812 --> 52:57.480
Because I only need to...

52:57.564 --> 52:58.815
Picture it, other BB.

52:58.898 --> 53:02.444
This baby, with its own ultra TK
mega library of video games.

53:02.610 --> 53:04.195
A taquito warming drawer.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.280
Racing stripes.

53:05.530 --> 53:07.741
Why would a computer
need racing stripes?

53:08.491 --> 53:10.827
A computer would not need
racing stripes.

53:10.994 --> 53:13.747
But a remote control
funnel cake deep-fryer would.

53:13.913 --> 53:14.873
No way.

53:17.250 --> 53:18.376
Any animal?

53:18.543 --> 53:19.419
Mmm-hmm.

53:19.586 --> 53:21.254
How about a fairy armadillo?

53:22.672 --> 53:23.798
Oh, an aye-aye.

53:23.882 --> 53:25.258
Aye. Aye.

53:25.467 --> 53:26.301
Ooh!

53:26.426 --> 53:27.385
A Chengdu yak.

53:27.844 --> 53:30.096
Ooh! Does this mean
you have four stomachs?

53:30.221 --> 53:31.056
I don't knows.

53:31.264 --> 53:32.098
Let's find out.

53:41.107 --> 53:41.941
[gasps]

53:42.067 --> 53:42.901
[stomach rumbling]

53:42.984 --> 53:44.611
[groans] That's not sitting right.

53:44.778 --> 53:46.613
Ah, better.

53:46.696 --> 53:47.530
Hold up!

53:47.697 --> 53:48.615
[stomach rumbling]

53:50.492 --> 53:51.326
[sighs in relief]

53:51.409 --> 53:53.119
Uh-oh. Here comes number three.

53:53.244 --> 53:54.245
[shrieking]

53:54.537 --> 53:56.247
How is it getting worse each time?

53:56.539 --> 53:57.374
[pants]

53:57.457 --> 53:58.291
[sighs in relief]

53:58.541 --> 53:59.376
[stomach rumbling]

53:59.542 --> 54:00.460
Last one.

54:01.044 --> 54:01.878
[groans]

54:02.462 --> 54:03.546
[sighs in relief]

54:04.130 --> 54:05.548
Four stomachs in the house.

54:05.924 --> 54:06.758
[stomach rumbling]

54:06.841 --> 54:09.010
I got to go to the little yak's room.

54:11.721 --> 54:12.555
[shrieks]

54:15.225 --> 54:16.559
Oh, hey, Starfire.

54:17.185 --> 54:20.188
You guys sure do
things differently here.

54:20.271 --> 54:22.941
I, too, was a comer
to the newness of this world

54:23.024 --> 54:25.527
on a day that was
not long from this one.

54:25.610 --> 54:27.195
Bet that took getting used to.

54:27.278 --> 54:29.447
Permit me to give the piece of advice?

54:29.614 --> 54:30.824
Sure, let's hear it.

54:31.241 --> 54:34.160
[whispering] Despite the deliciousness
of their appearance,

54:34.452 --> 54:37.414
cats may not be ingested.

54:40.583 --> 54:43.837
Oh. Uh, thank you, Starfire.

54:44.087 --> 54:45.338
Good to know.

54:46.756 --> 54:48.383
Yeah, my team would
pretty much follow me

54:48.466 --> 54:49.509
to the end of the Earth.

54:49.592 --> 54:50.635
I mean, it's not like

54:50.760 --> 54:52.679
being a better team leader
is a competition.

54:52.762 --> 54:55.181
It's just, well, if it were,
I'd probably win.

54:55.306 --> 54:56.808
And, if this mug is to be believed,

54:56.891 --> 54:58.226
I already have.

54:59.060 --> 55:00.854
You bought that yourself, didn't you?

55:01.020 --> 55:02.689
[chuckles nervously] What? No!

55:03.106 --> 55:06.985
Sheesh! Sounds like someone's got
a little mug envy.

55:07.068 --> 55:08.570
Well, I have no mug,

55:08.653 --> 55:10.780
nor any such boastful
beverage conveyance.

55:10.864 --> 55:14.409
I do have a lasso that can compel anyone
to tell the truth.

55:14.492 --> 55:15.618
Would you like to try it?

55:16.244 --> 55:17.078
[mug breaking]

55:17.203 --> 55:18.246
[high-pitched voice] I bought the mug.

55:22.792 --> 55:24.544
You find them instantly
annoying too, huh?

55:26.087 --> 55:26.921
[laughs softly]

55:27.130 --> 55:28.298
They're not so bad.

55:30.300 --> 55:32.635
We only have one bonehead on our team.

55:33.011 --> 55:33.928
Me.

55:34.054 --> 55:35.805
It's my fault we're stuck here.

55:36.848 --> 55:37.849
Messed up a spell?

55:37.932 --> 55:39.017
It happens.

55:41.102 --> 55:42.145
It's more than a spell.

55:43.063 --> 55:44.606
There's a part of me.

55:44.814 --> 55:45.899
A dark part.

55:46.483 --> 55:48.193
I've always been frightened of it.

55:48.610 --> 55:49.903
But, lately...

55:51.279 --> 55:53.239
Never mind, it's complicated.

55:54.866 --> 55:55.742
Yeah.

55:55.909 --> 55:57.369
I wish there was some way
I could relate.

55:57.911 --> 55:59.371
Oh, wait. I just remembered.

55:59.621 --> 56:01.915
I am Raven, daughter of Trigon,

56:02.082 --> 56:05.085
demonic overlord of all he surveys.

56:09.881 --> 56:11.549
[both laugh]

56:16.513 --> 56:17.806
Not bad, other BB.

56:17.972 --> 56:20.225
-We did it.
-You were right.

56:20.475 --> 56:22.394
The racing stripes are a nice touch.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.812
You two got the computer working?

56:24.270 --> 56:26.022
I just need to power
the external V-drive.

56:26.231 --> 56:29.359
So we'll need a AAA battery,
like the one in a TV remote.

56:33.321 --> 56:35.115
[exclaiming nervously]

56:35.365 --> 56:37.158
Our universe doesn't have remotes.

56:37.325 --> 56:38.827
Yeah, yeah.

56:38.910 --> 56:40.995
We's control TVs with our minds.

56:41.413 --> 56:42.247
[button clicks]

56:44.332 --> 56:46.918
Fear not. We will find a battery--

56:47.001 --> 56:48.878
Oh, yeah. <i>Battleship Bake Off!</i>

56:49.045 --> 56:51.798
So, did you have a battery, or no?

56:52.799 --> 56:54.718
Huh? Battery? Oh, yeah.

56:54.801 --> 56:55.635
Help yourself.

56:55.719 --> 56:57.095
I think I saw one in the garage.

56:57.262 --> 56:59.097
Or did I see one in the foyer?

56:59.347 --> 57:00.974
Ooh la-la. Fo-yay.

57:01.141 --> 57:03.226
[laughs] He means fo-yur, yo.

57:03.393 --> 57:05.228
Fo-yur? Where's your flair?

57:05.311 --> 57:06.187
Your passion?

57:06.312 --> 57:07.647
Get some culture, fool.

57:07.772 --> 57:09.858
-It's pronounced fo-yur, bro.
-Nah-uh.

57:09.941 --> 57:11.443
Fo-yay, all the way.

57:11.526 --> 57:13.111
Of course, this building comes equipped

57:13.194 --> 57:15.989
with neither the fo-yur, nor the fo-yay.

57:16.281 --> 57:18.533
That's really not the point now,
is it, Starfire?

57:18.616 --> 57:20.035
We do so have a foyer.

57:20.118 --> 57:21.828
Wait. That's really more of a portico.

57:21.911 --> 57:23.455
Do you have a battery or not?

57:24.289 --> 57:25.623
Yes. You remind me of me.

57:25.707 --> 57:27.375
Let's go find one.

57:27.751 --> 57:28.585
[objects clattering]

57:28.752 --> 57:31.337
Oh, oh, no, he did not.

57:32.130 --> 57:33.590
Right, let's go.

57:35.300 --> 57:38.553
So, Luthor,
what's the first order of business

57:38.636 --> 57:41.139
as rulers of the world? [giggles]

57:41.890 --> 57:42.974
Luthor?

57:44.642 --> 57:46.269
Uh, hello?

57:46.352 --> 57:47.187
What's with him?

57:47.270 --> 57:48.229
[crashing]

57:52.067 --> 57:53.151
Where is Superman?

57:56.946 --> 57:58.698
Where is Superman?

57:58.782 --> 57:59.908
[Giganta] Get her!

58:01.951 --> 58:02.869
[Cythonna] That's enough, children.

58:06.748 --> 58:08.375
Come, let's talk.

58:11.878 --> 58:14.506
You've always believed in me, yes?

58:14.589 --> 58:16.800
Let's just say I heard stories.

58:16.883 --> 58:19.719
Then you know my essence
will soon be free,

58:19.803 --> 58:23.681
and I shall require a strong,
new Kryptonian body.

58:23.765 --> 58:26.893
Ain't happening.
Kal-El's coming with me.

58:26.976 --> 58:31.731
Oh. And you wonder why others presume
Kal-El is superior to you,

58:31.898 --> 58:34.692
when you yourself
make the same presumption.

58:34.776 --> 58:37.946
Wait, you mean, you... you want me?

58:38.446 --> 58:42.450
Well, I mean, I can't blame you.
I am pretty awesome.

58:43.660 --> 58:49.374
Join me, and together, we will show
the universe the true meaning of power.

58:50.208 --> 58:52.752
Yeah, that's going to be a hard pass.

58:52.961 --> 58:54.754
Oh, well, in that case...

58:55.213 --> 58:58.466
[ominous music playing]

58:58.633 --> 59:00.593
-Kal!
-Submit...

59:01.177 --> 59:02.429
-or he dies.
-[gasps]

59:03.722 --> 59:05.390
I'll give you
some time to think about it.

59:05.557 --> 59:07.308
[screaming]

59:07.559 --> 59:08.476
[thuds]

59:08.560 --> 59:10.603
No! You can't do this.

59:10.729 --> 59:14.899
[sinister music playing]

59:16.151 --> 59:18.153
It's not about
not having dark thoughts, Zee.

59:18.236 --> 59:21.114
It's about embracing those thoughts
as part of who you are.

59:21.406 --> 59:24.284
But what if I do embrace them,
and I lose control?

59:24.743 --> 59:26.453
What if I hurt someone?

59:26.536 --> 59:28.288
Hmm. You might be surprised

59:28.371 --> 59:29.998
what darkness can do,
if you give it a chance.

59:30.331 --> 59:31.958
Out of all the infinite universes,

59:32.042 --> 59:34.210
your magic just happened
to bring you here,

59:34.294 --> 59:36.755
where you got a brief and
narratively convenient pep-talk

59:36.880 --> 59:39.340
from someone who deals
with the exact same thing.

59:42.177 --> 59:44.095
[creature roaring]

59:46.347 --> 59:48.349
Yeesh! Who would've thunk
getting a little battery

59:48.433 --> 59:49.851
would become such an epic hassle?

59:50.060 --> 59:52.187
Dude, we face way epic-er hassles

59:52.270 --> 59:54.522
for much smaller stakes all the time.

59:54.606 --> 59:55.523
It's kind of our thing.

59:56.775 --> 59:59.235
[electronic whirring]

59:59.319 --> 01:00:02.781
Back online and ready to go.
I just hope Zee's up to it.

01:00:04.532 --> 01:00:07.077
Next up, Phantom Zone.

01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:11.956
You know, you might want to bring
the big guns with you on this mission.

01:00:13.166 --> 01:00:14.959
Are they fighting over a remote?

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:18.421
Come on, BB. I've seen this episode.
[grunts]

01:00:20.548 --> 01:00:23.218
Er, we appreciate the offer, Boy Wonder.

01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:24.594
But this is our fight.

01:00:24.677 --> 01:00:25.720
No, I get it.

01:00:25.887 --> 01:00:27.722
It's your big adventure.

01:00:28.056 --> 01:00:29.891
Bringing us along would
only upstage you.

01:00:30.475 --> 01:00:33.937
I guess this is goodbye.
Thank you, Raven.

01:00:40.819 --> 01:00:42.153
Bye Cy.

01:00:42.278 --> 01:00:43.905
Let me know how
<i>Battleship Bake Off</i> ends.

01:00:44.072 --> 01:00:45.240
Peace, love and animals, yo!

01:00:45.323 --> 01:00:46.700
Keep them racing stripes shiny.

01:00:46.866 --> 01:00:48.118
Take me with you!

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.414
So long! By the way,
our adventure was in theaters.

01:00:55.917 --> 01:00:56.918
You okay, Zee?

01:00:57.669 --> 01:00:59.129
Oh, I'm better than okay.

01:00:59.546 --> 01:01:00.588
Whee!

01:01:05.051 --> 01:01:07.637
[grunts] Kara, I told you to--

01:01:07.846 --> 01:01:09.681
I know what you told me, Kal.

01:01:09.806 --> 01:01:11.850
Just because you think
you're so much better than me

01:01:11.933 --> 01:01:13.017
doesn't mean you can tell me--

01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:16.062
I'm not better than you, Kara.
Not by a long shot.

01:01:19.023 --> 01:01:21.985
Then why are you
always such a jerk to me?

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.945
I never told you this, but

01:01:24.028 --> 01:01:26.698
when you first got here,
I was so excited.

01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:29.993
I thought, finally someone else
who will understand

01:01:30.076 --> 01:01:32.037
just how lonely it is to be...

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.998
Super. You know,
saying it out loud just now...

01:01:35.373 --> 01:01:38.293
Mm, it is kind of pretentious
to call ourselves that.

01:01:38.376 --> 01:01:39.961
You're not lonely, Kara.

01:01:40.045 --> 01:01:42.380
Look at your friends. They're family.

01:01:42.464 --> 01:01:45.508
Then look at mine. Ugh, Batman? Really?

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:47.635
-Dude's got serious issues.
-Wait.

01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:50.180
Are you jealous of my friends?

01:01:50.263 --> 01:01:52.932
[sighs] I'm jealous of your strength.

01:01:53.016 --> 01:01:56.227
Okay, I'm only going to say this because
you said something kind of nice, but,

01:01:56.853 --> 01:02:00.148
Kal, you are way stronger than me.

01:02:00.315 --> 01:02:02.067
Well, I am Superman.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:05.070
[groaning] But that's not what I mean.

01:02:06.237 --> 01:02:08.073
I was born with super strength.

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:11.242
It was handed to me. But, you,

01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:14.162
your strength, your true strength

01:02:14.245 --> 01:02:17.874
of character, of conviction,
you earned that on your own.

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:20.794
Way before you got anywhere
near a yellow sun.

01:02:22.379 --> 01:02:24.464
Now we know there's gotta be an answer.

01:02:24.756 --> 01:02:27.258
You just gotta use those noggins
right there, man.

01:02:27.342 --> 01:02:29.260
You gotta use them to grab that answer.

01:02:30.178 --> 01:02:32.055
Seriously, man, nothing?

01:02:32.263 --> 01:02:36.851
-Is it a bread box?
-Ding-ding-ding, you got it.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.938
Man, you're good, kid.
You are good. Whoo!

01:02:40.897 --> 01:02:47.612
[instrumental music playing]

01:02:48.405 --> 01:02:49.948
Anyone need a lift?

01:02:50.615 --> 01:02:53.827
Any second, your master
shall be set free.

01:02:54.411 --> 01:02:56.496
[electronic whirring]

01:03:03.294 --> 01:03:05.630
Heroes! Take them down!

01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:12.512
If I had my mace--

01:03:13.012 --> 01:03:13.888
[grunts]

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.601
Huh?

01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:21.312
I shrunk it down to bring to you,

01:03:21.396 --> 01:03:24.774
but totally forgot about it until
you said something. Sorry.

01:03:24.899 --> 01:03:27.277
Oh, I missed you too.

01:03:27.569 --> 01:03:28.778
Hey, Batman!

01:03:30.113 --> 01:03:33.742
So, I know you know about the Joker,
but did you hear about me and Bane?

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.246
[muttering]

01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:42.375
Oh, you did? Yeah? I beat him
pretty good. First try, too. Heh.

01:03:42.459 --> 01:03:43.835
How'd you do against him
your first time?

01:03:44.502 --> 01:03:45.378
[grunts]

01:03:49.132 --> 01:03:50.133
[snarling]

01:03:50.216 --> 01:03:53.511
I wish I had a clever remark
about you both being feline villains.

01:04:01.519 --> 01:04:04.689
Looks as if you two
are ready for a cat nap.

01:04:05.273 --> 01:04:06.357
Stick with what you know, Diana.

01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:07.776
[grunting]

01:04:11.321 --> 01:04:14.532
Oh, that the hardest Lantern can hit?

01:04:14.699 --> 01:04:15.575
[Jon] No.

01:04:18.078 --> 01:04:20.163
That is the hardest Lantern can hit.

01:04:20.497 --> 01:04:22.665
Oh, now I get why they went with you.

01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:23.708
[both grunting]

01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:27.337
[groaning] Grundy angry.

01:04:29.964 --> 01:04:33.093
How many Lanterns are there?

01:04:33.176 --> 01:04:35.428
Three. It's a big number, I know.

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:37.097
Keep trying, you'll get there.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.017
[straining]

01:04:41.142 --> 01:04:43.686
These no hold Grundy.

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.563
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

01:04:47.857 --> 01:04:50.568
Oh, and all without
even throwing a punch.

01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:52.278
Ah, look at that!

01:04:52.362 --> 01:04:55.281
Got you again. Totally feeling
deja vu right now.

01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:56.991
[laughs] So am I.

01:04:57.075 --> 01:04:58.034
[ominous music playing]

01:04:58.118 --> 01:05:00.412
-Back off, slick!
-Huh? [grunts]

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:03.748
Throwing cheap shots
at this one's my job.

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:07.585
Oh, my gosh, you changed your mind.

01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:11.089
Come on! You knew I was always
gonna come around.

01:05:11.172 --> 01:05:14.008
I just wanted to make
one of those perfectly-timed

01:05:14.092 --> 01:05:16.720
bad-guy-turns-good dramatic entrances.

01:05:16.803 --> 01:05:17.971
How'd I do?

01:05:18.138 --> 01:05:20.348
Oh, pretty good. Thanks.

01:05:20.932 --> 01:05:23.393
Can you see what's happening?

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.521
Kryptonite's messing
with my X-ray vision.

01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:28.231
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

01:05:29.691 --> 01:05:31.860
-She's free.
-Quick, Kara.

01:05:32.068 --> 01:05:34.028
[grunting]

01:05:34.779 --> 01:05:35.905
You gotta run.

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:37.365
She'll come for you.

01:05:37.449 --> 01:05:39.826
[sighs] I'm not leaving you
like this, Kal.

01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:41.953
Why do you have to be so bullheaded?

01:05:42.037 --> 01:05:44.706
Yeah, yeah, I am bullheaded, aren't I?

01:05:45.165 --> 01:05:46.958
Cythonna, I give up.

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:48.877
Do you hear me?

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.004
Kara... [grunts] What are you doing?

01:05:51.087 --> 01:05:52.047
[Supergirl] Sorry, Kal.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.423
I have no choice.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.300
It's your lucky day.

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:58.011
I give up to you, Cythonna.

01:05:58.219 --> 01:05:59.763
I'm all yours.

01:05:59.888 --> 01:06:02.390
[grunts] Kara! No!

01:06:02.766 --> 01:06:05.018
[laughs wickedly]

01:06:08.438 --> 01:06:09.314
Okay.

01:06:09.606 --> 01:06:10.940
What exactly happened here?

01:06:11.524 --> 01:06:15.320
[groans] Felt like evil overdrive.

01:06:15.695 --> 01:06:17.197
Totally grody.

01:06:17.489 --> 01:06:18.406
Ugh!

01:06:21.159 --> 01:06:22.452
That's the last of 'em, Wonder Woman.

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:25.038
Good work, Hal.
Any sign of Supergirl yet?

01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:27.332
Nope. Not of her or Superman.

01:06:27.749 --> 01:06:28.666
Come on, Kara,

01:06:29.876 --> 01:06:31.127
[explosion]

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:34.255
Kara?

01:06:37.509 --> 01:06:38.760
Kara is gone.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.805
I am Cythonna.

01:06:43.431 --> 01:06:44.641
What do we do, Wonder Woman?

01:06:55.026 --> 01:06:57.445
Hal, you and the others
get the Legion to safety.

01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:58.530
We got Cythonna.

01:06:58.613 --> 01:07:00.240
No way. She's too powerful.

01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:02.492
Carter, they can handle it.

01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:05.120
This is a job for the Super Hero Girls.

01:07:05.245 --> 01:07:06.204
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.627
Okay, Dee, what's the plan?

01:07:16.339 --> 01:07:17.799
We fight.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:22.053
I was so hoping you would say that.

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.221

Kara!

[rock music playing]

01:07:48.747 --> 01:07:53.251
A rather strange representation
of your inner mind, Kara Zor-El.

01:07:53.793 --> 01:07:55.462
It's my happy place.

01:07:55.545 --> 01:07:58.548
Means I still run things in here.

01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:01.217
I knew I wouldn't stand a chance
against you in the real world,

01:08:01.384 --> 01:08:02.635
but I figure now,

01:08:02.719 --> 01:08:05.013
at least I have some
home-field advantage.

01:08:06.014 --> 01:08:08.224
[laughs mischievously]

01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:11.936
Wait, are you challenging me?

01:08:12.437 --> 01:08:14.397
Yeah, something like that.

01:08:14.606 --> 01:08:17.942

-Guys, she's fighting it.

01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:33.291

01:08:35.752 --> 01:08:36.920
[muttering]

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:39.756
What do you mean,
in case I ever got out of line?

01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:42.008
[sighs] Serious issues.

01:08:43.176 --> 01:08:44.301
[grunts]

01:08:46.513 --> 01:08:48.348
[panting] You caught me off guard.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.809
Seems even I underestimated you.

01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:53.185
Yeah, a lot of that going around.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.647

Kara, are you still in there?

01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:23.174
Oh, she's still here, suffering.

I said, stand down!

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.821
Uh, I, I'd do what she says, Bruce.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.532
Sisters, Kara is in there.

01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:49.075
She needs us.

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:53.662

We believe in you.

I believe in you.

01:10:32.577 --> 01:10:33.870
I always have.

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:35.789
Now kick her butt.

01:10:35.872 --> 01:10:39.959
I can't wait to turn
your despicable world to ash.

01:10:40.293 --> 01:10:43.963
This place only makes me
all of the more homesick for Krypton.

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.591
You know what I miss most about Krypton?

The crystals.

You did it, Kara.

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:22.335
Thanks for trusting me, D.

01:11:22.877 --> 01:11:23.712
Hmm?

in the Fortress of Solitude.

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:34.723

-Batman.

01:11:37.016 --> 01:11:38.017
He can wait.

01:11:38.101 --> 01:11:41.104
You know, ever since Robin
got all swept up in his Nightwing phase,

01:11:41.187 --> 01:11:42.772
he's been bugging me.

01:11:42.856 --> 01:11:46.484
Wow. I remember when you would have
killed to be his sidekick.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:49.112
Well, I've got my own sidekick now.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:53.283
Oh, no, you're the sidekick.

01:11:53.366 --> 01:11:56.703
This girl's a headliner
through and through.

01:11:58.329 --> 01:12:00.457
Besides, if Batman really needed help,

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.667
he's got his League buddies, right, Dee?

01:12:02.876 --> 01:12:05.712
Yes, while I agreed to be
a reserve member,

01:12:05.795 --> 01:12:07.380
my true place is here.

01:12:07.505 --> 01:12:08.381
[glasses clinking]

01:12:11.426 --> 01:12:12.427
Wait a minute.

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:15.346
They're talking about feelings
and what they learned?

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:17.390
That only happens at the end of the...

01:12:17.474 --> 01:12:20.185
[gasps] This is the denouement.

01:12:20.518 --> 01:12:22.103
The de-new-ment!

01:12:22.854 --> 01:12:25.315
It's de-now-ement, Lord Fauntleroy.

01:12:26.024 --> 01:12:27.108
Not today, BB.

01:12:27.192 --> 01:12:28.443
This show's over.

01:12:28.526 --> 01:12:30.278
And we weren't even in it.

01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:31.946
I am not understanding.

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.908
You said we had the role
that is big to play.

01:12:34.991 --> 01:12:36.493
Keep watching.

01:12:38.036 --> 01:12:39.954
You know, Zee, I've been meaning to ask.

01:12:40.038 --> 01:12:42.374
Where did you send
that Cythonna crystal anyway?

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.250
You know, since I've come
to terms with this

01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:48.421
whole dark magic part of me,
I figured let it decide.

01:12:49.172 --> 01:12:50.382

[ominous music playing]

01:13:03.478 --> 01:13:05.480
Now I know what you're up to,
Control Freak.

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:08.149
Or should I say, Cythonna!

01:13:13.947 --> 01:13:15.490
[coughs]

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.326
Man, it's like a farago of B.O.,
barbecue corn chips

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:19.828
and rancid strawberry milk.

01:13:20.912 --> 01:13:23.581
Cayenne and onion chips, thank you.

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:26.126
I knew something was up
when you complimented Robin.

01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:27.502
Who does that?

01:13:27.627 --> 01:13:29.587
But now you've shown your hand.

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:33.007
And for the record,
I was always on to you, Cythonna.

01:13:33.133 --> 01:13:34.509
Even before Raven was, I'm sure.

01:13:34.592 --> 01:13:38.096
But, I too was waiting for you
to show your hand.

01:13:38.179 --> 01:13:39.139
Really?

01:13:39.222 --> 01:13:41.182
What is my hand, Boy Wonder?

01:13:41.975 --> 01:13:43.643
Well, [stuttering] I could tell you,

01:13:43.727 --> 01:13:45.729
but I don't want to step
on Raven's toes.

01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:47.147
She wants her crystal back.

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.695
That's right. It is mine.

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.904
Now, give it to me!

01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:56.573
Starfire, catch.

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.284
-Give what to you?
-Ah!

01:13:59.367 --> 01:14:00.452
The crystal!

01:14:02.412 --> 01:14:05.040
Oh, you mean the crystal
that was in the hand,

01:14:05.123 --> 01:14:07.083
but is now no longer in the hand

01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:08.501
because of the keeping of away.

01:14:08.585 --> 01:14:10.378
[Cythonna] Give it! Give it.

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:13.214
Horrible, horrible children.
Give it to me.

01:14:13.339 --> 01:14:15.008
I demand it. My crystal.

01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:17.677
Give it to me, you horrible,
horrible children.

01:14:17.761 --> 01:14:18.720
I will destroy you.

01:14:18.803 --> 01:14:20.764
I will destroy this whole universe.

01:14:21.014 --> 01:14:23.808
We told you, C-train,
we don't do epic threats.

01:14:23.975 --> 01:14:25.894
Raven, send this fool somewhere
they give a snot.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.354
...at once! I demand you.

01:14:28.438 --> 01:14:30.023
Please! I need it.

01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:31.733
[yells] No!

01:14:34.569 --> 01:14:35.612
Now what's we gonna dos?

01:14:35.695 --> 01:14:37.947
I means, the TV's crooked, yo.

01:14:38.031 --> 01:14:39.949
Nuh-uh. I can't watch a crooked TV.

01:14:40.033 --> 01:14:42.327
You know the strain
that's gonna put on my neck servos?

01:14:43.119 --> 01:14:46.664
So, Raven, where did you send
our friend and her little crystal?

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.708
I don't know. Somewhere.

01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:55.256
<i>Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice...</i>

01:14:57.258 --> 01:14:59.803
Great Scott, what is this?

01:15:02.639 --> 01:15:04.891
According to the Justice League
computer,

01:15:05.016 --> 01:15:06.976
it's from this crossover dimension.

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.603
Holy crossovers!

01:15:08.686 --> 01:15:10.146
Does this mean the Super Friends

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:13.066
have to travel to this strange
dimension and return it?

01:15:15.902 --> 01:15:17.821
[clamoring]

01:15:28.623 --> 01:15:32.961
That is going to be a hard pass
from the Super Friends.

01:15:36.256 --> 01:15:38.174
