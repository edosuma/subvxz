00:01.218 --> 00:02.785
Previously onLegacies...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.526
ALARIC: Landon took a knife.
Now monsters that

00:04.569 --> 00:07.485
shouldn't exist have been
coming after it ever since.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.313
LANDON: What's Malivore? HOPE: It's a hell dimension

00:09.357 --> 00:11.620
that consumes creatures
and wipes their existence

00:11.663 --> 00:13.013
from the collective conscience.

00:13.056 --> 00:15.102
Malivore's gonna rise
unless I stop him.

00:15.145 --> 00:17.191
Because once I toss myself
into that pit, no one at school

00:17.234 --> 00:19.149
will remember me,
including you.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.846
This is the part where you
tell me you're proud of me.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.587
You know I'm proud of you.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.155
Malivore doesn't want me here.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.548
Malivore's trying
to expel you.

00:26.591 --> 00:27.853
Good luck, Clarke.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.464
So how is the headmaster
search going?

00:29.507 --> 00:30.856
Caroline's narrowing it down.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.990
If you have someone
to help you be happy.

00:36.123 --> 00:40.475
You send me back and I will
destroy Hope Mikaelson.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.305
Oh, crap.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.398
Dissera Portus.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.406
ETHAN: Aren't you a little
short for a janitor?

01:42.450 --> 01:45.017
It's nice to know I'm not
the only one trying to hide out

01:45.061 --> 01:46.715
on the first day of school.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.673
Oh, no, I-I wasn't hiding.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.197
I-I was, um, uh,

01:50.240 --> 01:51.763
I was looking
for the principal's office.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.200
Well, you're in luck.
I'm new, too,

01:53.243 --> 01:55.463
but I'm pretty sure
that's him right behind you.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.117
Hi.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.599
I'm Principal Saltzman.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.732

I thought you said yoga
was karate for lazy people.

02:27.756 --> 02:30.889
I did, but spending
the summer with Mom

02:30.933 --> 02:33.631
opened my eyes to all kinds
of new experiences.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.460
Plus, since using that ascendant
thingy is off the table,

02:36.504 --> 02:37.809
we agreed we'd stop worrying

02:37.853 --> 02:40.508
about all that future
merge crap, right?

02:40.551 --> 02:42.031
Right.

02:42.074 --> 02:45.077
So I'm all about
the present.

02:45.121 --> 02:48.994
I have decided to be permanently
open to any opportunity

02:49.038 --> 02:50.518
that comes my way.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.260
This is my semester of yes.

02:53.303 --> 02:58.003
And I am available
for literally anything.

03:24.943 --> 03:29.034
Well, this simply won't do.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.476
Phantamogriphia Decorum.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.263
Ah, much better.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.613
Simple illusion spell,
but appearances

03:42.657 --> 03:45.747
can be important,
don't you think, Mr. Williams?

03:45.790 --> 03:46.965
The faculty
are waiting

03:47.009 --> 03:48.880

Did not know that.

Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

05:06.480 --> 05:09.134
Uh, too popular to still take me
to dinner tonight?

05:09.178 --> 05:11.615
No. We have to get

be right between Lizzie and me,

05:49.218 --> 05:52.047
and this stale blood
is nasty, man.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.657
Why'd we have
to be the ones

05:53.701 --> 05:56.399
to get rid of Dr. Saltzman's
creepy skull fountain?

05:56.443 --> 05:57.792

05:59.576 --> 06:01.186
the time is now, okay?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.363
She's having a year of yes.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.061
So get in there,
be one of those yeses.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.585
I mean, I... I guess
I could ask her on, like,

06:08.629 --> 06:09.804
a study date or something.

06:09.847 --> 06:13.808
Yeah. Ooh, the Old Mill.

06:13.851 --> 06:16.114
Why there?Are you for real?

06:16.158 --> 06:18.552
You never heard of
"Old Mill and chill"?

06:18.595 --> 06:22.164
Well, look, you ask her
on a study date there,

06:22.207 --> 06:24.514
I promise you
she'll know what's up.

06:24.558 --> 06:27.387
Okay.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.432
Oh, damn.
What-what are you doing?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.042
I breathed out of my nose.I specifically told you

06:31.086 --> 06:34.219
not to do that and you did that.
Let's... Come on, let's go.

06:34.263 --> 06:38.310
This school has survived
a difficult year.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.443
There were monsters and Triad,

06:40.487 --> 06:44.142
and frankly, the headmaster
you trusted to keep you safe

06:44.186 --> 06:45.970
ended up putting you
in more danger.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.453
But this year will be different.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.455
It's high time
this place ran

06:52.499 --> 06:55.110
with a little discipline
and order.

06:55.153 --> 06:59.854
I expect you to work
harder than ever before.

06:59.897 --> 07:03.727
To be rigorous, to push
yourselves. To be perfect.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.689
Because I believe every one
of you is extraordinary.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.560
The students in this room

07:10.604 --> 07:13.084
have the power to literally
change the world.

07:16.610 --> 07:21.136
To whom much is given,
much is required,

07:21.179 --> 07:23.399
and I am requiring of you

07:23.443 --> 07:26.141
to be better
than humans ever could.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.404
Because the day
is coming when we

07:28.448 --> 07:30.841
will step out of the shadows,
when you

07:30.885 --> 07:32.800
will no longer hide yourselves.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.758
Because the future is...

07:37.239 --> 07:39.546
...supernatural.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.422
To that end,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.380
I would like
to award our

07:48.424 --> 07:50.382
Salvatore Medal of Freedom

07:50.426 --> 07:52.297
to the student who
single-handedly

07:52.341 --> 07:55.779
defeated Malivore,
Mr. Landon Kirby.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.142
There you are.
Well done, young man.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.320
ALARIC:
You are

08:15.364 --> 08:16.887
a blank slate,
Miss Hope...

08:16.931 --> 08:19.107
Marshall.

08:19.150 --> 08:22.110
Parents Tom
and Kathleen.

08:23.372 --> 08:25.635
No transcripts
from your last school.

08:25.679 --> 08:29.073
I think they must've just
gotten packed away or something.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.249
Like I said,
we move around a lot.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.773
Mm-hmm.

08:32.816 --> 08:37.299
Well, if you are gonna
be here in Mystic Falls,

08:37.342 --> 08:39.083
you have to go to school.

08:39.127 --> 08:42.347
Well, then I guess it's
a good thing I'm here, right?

08:42.391 --> 08:45.176
Can I go now?

08:45.220 --> 08:46.830
You know, I, uh...

08:48.876 --> 08:50.225
I've got two daughters,

08:50.268 --> 08:53.881
and I know when they're
not telling me something.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.448
So, you know, if there's, uh,

08:56.492 --> 08:59.016
anything going wrong at home,

08:59.060 --> 09:01.889
you know, if you're in any
trouble and you need to talk,

09:01.932 --> 09:04.805
just know I'm here
to help, okay?

09:04.848 --> 09:07.155
I'm fine.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.220
MAYA:
Boy problems?

09:29.264 --> 09:32.223
Uh, yeah.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.225
He's kind of a troll.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.445
Oh, my God,
say no more.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.621
We'll fix you up
and make him jealous.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.797
I have an extra shirt
in my locker,

09:40.841 --> 09:42.756
and I've got
hair spray,

09:42.799 --> 09:44.366
lip gloss,

09:44.409 --> 09:46.890
and new eyeliner.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.198
Maya.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.591
Hope.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.463
Thank you.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.899
Weird question. Um,

09:55.943 --> 09:57.684
by any chance, have you
noticed a terrible smell

09:57.727 --> 09:59.076
coming from somewhere
inside the school?

09:59.120 --> 10:02.253
I think everyone has.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.130
Teenage boys plus monster.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.828
That's a special combo.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.712
All right.

10:25.755 --> 10:26.974
Okay, seriously.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.497
Who are you?

10:34.198 --> 10:36.636
Ah, okay.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.943
I'm a a vampire hunter.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.468
And I-I,
I came across a creature.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.558
What kind of creature?

10:46.602 --> 10:50.780
A creature that's big enough
to flip over an empty bus.

10:50.824 --> 10:54.044
It's green, it's ugly and it
smells absolutely terrible,

10:54.088 --> 10:57.657
so I'm going with a troll?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.180
And it's hiding
somewhere

10:59.223 --> 11:00.921
inside the school.Uh-huh.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.139
And how do you know that?

11:02.183 --> 11:04.794
Because I wounded it.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.970
It's nocturnal,
so it hides out during the day.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.929
I found a legend that says
I just have to pierce it

11:08.972 --> 11:10.974
through the heart...Listen, you're not
doing anything.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.584
Okay? You're just a kid.

11:12.628 --> 11:14.499
If there's a monster
in my school,

11:14.543 --> 11:16.588
I'm gonna take care of it.No offense,

11:16.632 --> 11:20.897
but, um, I've been trying to
kill this thing for over a week,

11:20.941 --> 11:22.377
and nothing's worked.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.335
If you are a vampire hunter,
then I'm sure

11:24.379 --> 11:26.120
you've heard of Alaric Saltzman?

11:26.163 --> 11:28.035
Yeah.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.211
I know what I'm doing.Yeah.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.954
You're very famous around here,
but you're gonna need my help.

11:36.870 --> 11:40.525
I have put kids
in danger before.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.616
And I'm not gonna make
that mistake again.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.837
Yes, of course,

11:47.881 --> 11:49.273
we'd love to have you
try out for the team.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.492
All are welcome.

11:50.535 --> 11:51.885
But certainly, in the, uh,

11:51.928 --> 11:54.539
meantime, just go
to class and...

11:54.583 --> 11:56.933
stay there.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.067
So...

12:00.110 --> 12:03.157
you going out for kicker
or are you just stalking me?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.636
Stalking you?

12:04.680 --> 12:06.551
I think it's pretty clear
who's stalking who here.

12:06.595 --> 12:09.250
Besides, if I went out,
it'd be for QB1.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.429
Hey, Lizzie.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.083
We're gonna cast a persuasion
spell to stop Tara

12:16.126 --> 12:17.519
from getting a pixie cut.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.129
Coming?
Yes.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.220
Uh, hey, Lizzie.

12:23.264 --> 12:24.874
Hey, Milton.

12:24.918 --> 12:27.355
Hi. Um,

12:27.398 --> 12:31.533
would you want to go on a
study date later with me?

12:32.577 --> 12:34.101
Yes.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.366
At the Old Mill?

12:38.409 --> 12:42.762
Uh, yes?

12:42.805 --> 12:45.590
2:00?

12:46.417 --> 12:48.071
All right.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.594
All right.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.775
VARDEMUS:
How does the existence
of dragons

12:55.818 --> 12:58.908
and dryads and phoenixes change

12:58.952 --> 13:02.912
what we know
about magical biology?

13:02.956 --> 13:07.656
It could be the discovery
of a lifetime.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.050
He is such a pompous ass.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.921
At least he hasn't tried
to kill us all yet.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.794
My dad wasn't trying
to kill anyone. He was...

13:14.837 --> 13:16.404
Jo.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.233
Never mind.

13:19.276 --> 13:21.017
VARDEMUS:
...as to the
magical origins

13:21.061 --> 13:23.454
of these species.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.003
Invidia.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.332
There you are. Hi.Hey.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.987
I made you a flat white.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.206
Just how you like.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.685
I already...

14:20.729 --> 14:22.339
Oh, that's okay, that's okay.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.864
Look, I could still drink...No, no, you really
don't have to.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.039
Okay.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.737
Um, are you okay?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.347
You kind of rocketed
out of class earlier.

14:30.391 --> 14:31.653
Um...

14:31.696 --> 14:34.961
Yeah, it's just,
with my dad not being here

14:35.004 --> 14:36.614
and us,

14:36.658 --> 14:38.007
it's, um, no, it's just
a lot of change is all.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.661
It just kind of got to me.Well, we could,

14:39.704 --> 14:40.880
I mean, we can totally
cancel dinner tonight,

14:40.923 --> 14:42.098
if you feel like
we're moving too fast...

14:42.142 --> 14:43.534
Do you think
we're moving too fast?

14:43.578 --> 14:45.754
No. Ab-- uh, no.
Not unless you do.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.887
I-- n-no, I don't think so.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.279
Okay.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.891
Good.
Good.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.241
So...

14:54.284 --> 14:56.025
Dinner still?
Yeah. Sure.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.244
Great.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.724
Um, sushi?

14:59.768 --> 15:01.726
Yeah.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.424
I love sushi. Sushi it is.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.034
Awesome.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.591
Sol.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.161
Hope!

16:40.521 --> 16:43.480
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and
agree with your troll theory.

16:43.524 --> 16:47.484
Yeah, well, it's nocturnal,
so I figured I'd just make

16:47.528 --> 16:50.139
some artificial sunlight.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.664
You didn't-- you didn't say
you were also a witch.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.189
Look, I'm just here
to kill this monster.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.147
Okay? Then I'll be
on my way before this

16:58.191 --> 17:01.020
gets any more complicated.MAYA:
Um...

17:04.545 --> 17:07.374
What is that?

17:14.511 --> 17:15.860
The sound was just
a busted water pipe.

17:15.904 --> 17:19.038
And then Dr. Saltzman...Principal Saltzman.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.126
My bad.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.431
Principal Saltzman
turned the water off

17:21.475 --> 17:23.216
and took care of everything.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.218
Wow.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.698
Crazy first day, huh?

17:27.742 --> 17:30.049
Great. You can head
back to class now.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.400
Ah. Don't even think about it.

17:35.097 --> 17:39.188
Uh... Uh, hey,
if he trusts you, so do I.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.582
Uh, by the way, I don't usually
do this. I'm not trying

17:41.625 --> 17:43.845
take anyone's agency
or anything, you know?

17:43.888 --> 17:45.194
So,

17:45.238 --> 17:46.717
I got to jet.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.068
I got a study date
with some-- uh...

17:49.111 --> 17:50.243
Uh, someone.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.288
It could-it could
be anybody, really.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.334
Well, thanks for getting here
so quickly. I appreciate it.

17:54.377 --> 17:57.946
Any time. You're--
you'll always my headmaster.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.911
So, uh,
why aren't you headmaster

18:06.955 --> 18:08.391
of that other school anymore?

18:08.435 --> 18:11.090
It's a long story.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.961
Oh. Okay. Uh...

18:13.004 --> 18:14.615
I'll be back
once school lets out

18:14.658 --> 18:17.879
so we can clean up
what's probably a dead troll.

18:17.922 --> 18:20.316
You're really not fazed
by any of this, are you?

18:20.360 --> 18:23.014
I-I mean, I-I just think
that the story that you told me,

18:23.058 --> 18:27.845
about the monsters
and the scary black pit, just...

18:27.889 --> 18:29.543
makes a lot of sense,
I guess.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.066
Um, look,

18:31.110 --> 18:34.591
I'm really glad
to hear that it stopped.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.550
I'm sorry
that it's happening again.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.769
It's not your fault.

18:40.206 --> 18:44.123
Now that I know your
cover story is a lie,

18:44.166 --> 18:47.430
I-I'm assuming
Tom and Kathleen aren't real.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.737
Okay.

18:49.780 --> 18:54.481
The school I used to work at,
you'd be welcome there.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.180
Oh, um...

18:58.224 --> 19:00.617
Yeah, that sounds amazing.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.533
But I'm just passing through.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.627
Hey, look, I, uh...

19:11.628 --> 19:12.934
I don't really have access

19:12.977 --> 19:14.805
to that school's
resources anymore,

19:14.849 --> 19:18.287
and I'm trying to give
my daughters some space.

19:18.331 --> 19:21.638
But if these monster attacks
are starting up again,

19:21.682 --> 19:24.119
I could use the backup.

19:25.599 --> 19:29.994
You know,
I don't really have anyone else.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.824
I work better alone.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.306
Okay.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.094
This is so lame, universe.

19:43.138 --> 19:47.011
I can't believe I got stood up
by Milton Greasley.

19:47.055 --> 19:51.755
This is what I get for assuming
you'd send something amaz...

19:55.368 --> 19:57.544
...zing.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.110
Hello.

19:59.154 --> 20:01.330
Uh, you must be new.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.158
What is this place?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.378
Oh, this is the Old Mill.
I mean, it's the only mill,

20:05.421 --> 20:06.988
but we all still call it
the Old Mill for some reason.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.337
I hope you're not here
to chill.

20:08.381 --> 20:11.340
I mean, I don't care either way.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.255
What's your name?

20:13.299 --> 20:15.953
I thought I knew
all of the incoming students.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.305
Oh, is this a school
of some kind?

20:19.348 --> 20:20.828
The Salvatore School.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.874
Named after Damon
and Stefan Salvatore, I guess.

20:23.918 --> 20:28.052
But that was, like,
a long time ago or whatever.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.620
I see.

20:31.621 --> 20:34.537
So, you're not a student?

20:34.581 --> 20:36.583
No.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.889
Okay, well, then, who are you?

20:38.933 --> 20:40.282
Oh, are you okay?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.936
Do you want to sit down?

20:41.979 --> 20:43.329
No-- no! No, I'm fine.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.940
You should, you should
keep your distance.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.029
I'm not gonna hurt you.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.597
That's not what I'm afraid of.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.599
I'm sorry, I, uh...

20:52.642 --> 20:54.514
I should go.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.167
Uh, wait.

20:57.517 --> 21:00.128
What's your name?

21:00.171 --> 21:02.348
Sebastian.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.959
I'm Lizzie.

21:05.002 --> 21:08.919
It's good to meet you,
Elizabeth.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.924
"Elizabeth" sounds too boring.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.842
I don't think
it sounds boring at all.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.942
Lizzie, I am so sorry.
Your dad called, and I had...

21:31.986 --> 21:33.596
Yeah, don't-don't
worry about it.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.772
You're not mad at me?

21:35.816 --> 21:38.514
Not at all.

21:38.558 --> 21:42.953
Hey, uh, I-I need to gather
some spell ingredients

21:42.997 --> 21:44.477
for an assignment.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.306
Uh, well, do you need company?

21:47.349 --> 21:50.265
Uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.443
ALARIC:
There's, uh, something
I want to ask.

21:54.487 --> 21:57.751
You know, when we were fighting,

21:57.794 --> 22:01.581
how'd I know to
throw that bolt to you?

22:01.624 --> 22:04.714
It was like muscle memory.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.935
We've fought together before,
haven't we?

22:07.978 --> 22:10.285
What? That seems
totally impossible.Yeah, except

22:10.329 --> 22:12.026
I live in a world where
a creature named Malivore

22:12.069 --> 22:14.724
can erase people
from your memory.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.815
I'll take that as a yes.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.078
Even if I told you,
it wouldn't change anything.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.471
Okay? It wouldn't bring
your memories back.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.820
It would just be words.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.996
Leaving will be easier
if you don't know.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.911
Well, then, don't leave.

22:27.955 --> 22:30.131
You told me that
the monster attacks had stopped,

22:30.174 --> 22:31.959
and then right when I show up,
things start happening again.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.048
I'm pretty sure
I'm the reason.

22:34.091 --> 22:37.356
So I can't stay and
put all of you in danger.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.537
HOPE:
Um...

22:44.580 --> 22:46.365
ALARIC:
Okay...

22:46.408 --> 22:48.192
so...

22:48.236 --> 22:50.717
not a troll.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.899
Lizzie, I had so much fun
with you today.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.466
And I know you had fun
with me, too.

23:00.509 --> 23:03.643
We have great chemistry,
we're both single.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.384
We should seize this opportunity

23:05.427 --> 23:07.951
and take our relationship
to the next level.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.520
Boo! What is that?

23:11.564 --> 23:12.739
You're not recruiting her

23:12.782 --> 23:14.523
to your multi-level marketing
company.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.873
Come on, man, try again.

23:16.917 --> 23:19.223
All right? You know,
just... feel it.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.269
Feel it.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.447
You a'ight, Lizzie?

23:27.014 --> 23:28.885
What the hell is that?
Come on, man.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.627
Just... how do you...

23:31.671 --> 23:33.455
When you look at her,

23:33.499 --> 23:34.848
how do you
really feel?

23:34.891 --> 23:36.763
I feel like I know her, man.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.765
All of her.
The good,

23:38.808 --> 23:40.897
the terrible, the bitchy,

23:40.941 --> 23:43.726
the funny, the fragile.
I know her favorite

23:43.770 --> 23:46.337
episode of her favorite TV show.

23:46.381 --> 23:49.428
I know who she is
when no one's watching.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.299
I like all of it.

23:51.342 --> 23:55.738
She deserves to be with someone
who sees her for who she is.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.480
Yeah, man.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.917
Say that.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.529
Just say that.

24:09.622 --> 24:13.452
Okay, so if it's not a troll,
then what else could it be?

24:13.495 --> 24:14.627
I don't know.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.411
But it's here.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.805
Somewhere.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.416
Question is, why?I'm not sure.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.113
I mean, the pattern
is that I wound it,

24:23.157 --> 24:24.419
and then it runs
and hides from me.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.160
So it must be sticking
to the shadows,

24:26.203 --> 24:28.162
waiting for it to get dark.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.905
Well, when the monsters came
last time, they were always

24:31.948 --> 24:34.298
after something.
See if we can

24:34.342 --> 24:36.779
figure out what
it's looking for.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.999
Okay.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.313
LANDON:
Are you sure you don't
want my jacket?

24:49.357 --> 24:51.490
I'm not cold.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.623
Are you mad at me?

24:54.667 --> 24:55.798
No.

24:57.626 --> 24:58.932
I don't really
believe that.

24:58.975 --> 25:01.412
Well, then, tell me
what you want me to say.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.153
I want you to say whether or not
you had a good time at dinner,

25:03.197 --> 25:05.329
because it seemed like you were
miserable the whole time.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.983
I mean, you didn't
want dessert.
I just don't

25:07.027 --> 25:08.245
feel good, can we just
talk about it tomorrow?

25:08.289 --> 25:09.812
No, you've been
weird all day.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.205
What changed?

25:11.248 --> 25:12.206
Nothing.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.425
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.

25:14.469 --> 25:16.340
Um...

25:16.384 --> 25:18.081
...we had a bad date.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.430
It happens.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.258
I'm gonna go home,
and I'm sure that

25:21.302 --> 25:22.999
everything's gonna
be fine tomorrow.

25:24.871 --> 25:28.048
LIZZIE:
Ahsorum, dolusantum,
infidictus.

25:28.091 --> 25:32.139
Picture the face of the person,
and then touch the map.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.706
If they are found
within its boundaries,

25:33.749 --> 25:35.534
the map will glow.

25:39.712 --> 25:43.193
Okay. Next one.

25:43.237 --> 25:45.239
SEBASTIAN:
Hello, Elizabeth.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.460
You again.

25:50.418 --> 25:53.639
Ah, you're a witch.Yeah.

25:53.682 --> 25:56.467
And you are clearly something,

25:56.511 --> 25:58.687
because you've gotten past
the magical defenses

25:58.731 --> 26:00.036
of this school
twice now,

26:00.080 --> 26:03.039
so, your turn to answer.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.260
What are you, exactly?

26:08.088 --> 26:10.656
What were you
looking for?

26:10.699 --> 26:11.918
Nothing.

26:11.961 --> 26:14.964
Um, this-- I-- I am
just waiting...

26:15.008 --> 26:17.488
for a friend.
Who's a guy.

26:17.532 --> 26:20.666
And, um, he'll be
any moment.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.102
Oh.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.280
Um, you haven't answered
any of my questions yet.

26:26.323 --> 26:31.241
If you aren't a student,
what are you doing here?

26:31.285 --> 26:34.070
I came to see you.

26:34.114 --> 26:36.072
'Cause I have a request.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.553
Which is...?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.729
Stop looking for me.

26:40.773 --> 26:43.732
I'm not.You're drawn to me.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.081
I can sense it.

26:45.125 --> 26:46.692
I'm drawn to you, too,

26:46.735 --> 26:50.086
but you shouldn't
let me get too close.

26:50.913 --> 26:54.264
And why is that?

26:56.092 --> 26:59.226

and, well, my life

26:59.269 --> 27:02.969

40:47.314 --> 40:51.057
