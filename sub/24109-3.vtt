00:01.640 --> 00:02.920
I had an accident.

00:03.840 --> 00:05.320
I've got memory problems.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.320
Since the accident all new info is erased.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.960
The disappearance of Thomas Spectre.
- Should I know him?

00:12.160 --> 00:14.320
Is talking to the police a struggle too?

00:14.520 --> 00:18.080
I want to find my way myself first
before I talk to other people about it.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.560
I'm scared things will be
wrongly interpreted.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.600
Where did Thomas Spectre get it?

00:23.800 --> 00:27.240
Did you check whether I ever reported
I was being stalked?

00:27.440 --> 00:28.920
May I have your drawing?

00:29.120 --> 00:31.720
Vronsky. I'm a pyromaniac.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.040
Can I introduce you
to our new nurse Mozes?

00:37.240 --> 00:38.480
Mie?
- Sorry.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.240
You don't hit my children.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.840
ARGUMENT NIKKI
HIT LEON

00:44.160 --> 00:48.720
Where are my Post-Its?
- What's going on in that head of yours?

00:48.920 --> 00:52.080
If you can't remember,
your imagination fills in the gaps.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.240
Maybe you two knew each other well.
- I'm happily married.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.760
Any guy could throw you
on this table and fuck you.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.160
Who are you?

02:08.960 --> 02:11.920
BABE IN THE WOODS

02:13.400 --> 02:19.440
<i>Of all birds in the world the nutcracker
has the biggest spatial memory.</i>

02:19.640 --> 02:23.160
<i>In the autumn it collects
more than 30,000 nuts and seeds,</i>

02:23.360 --> 02:28.320
<i>which it hides over an area
of 20 square kilometres.</i>

02:28.520 --> 02:31.920
<i>In the winter this little bird relies on
its amazing memory</i>

02:32.120 --> 02:36.880
<i>to find its stored food and
survive the winter months.</i>

02:37.080 --> 02:43.760
<i>Over time the memory of both man
and animal has evolved with one aim,</i>

02:45.360 --> 02:47.000
<i>to survive.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:52.000
<i>2 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE</i>

05:15.880 --> 05:17.360
Hello, Mum.
- Oh!

05:17.560 --> 05:23.040
Jesus! You frightened the life out of me.
- It's your guilty conscience.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.640
I watered your plants, by the way.
They needed it.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.000
They're desert plants, Mum.
- How was I supposed to know?

05:29.200 --> 05:33.000
You're not going to
leave these curtains up, are you?

05:33.200 --> 05:38.640
What d'you reckon? Something with
some colour? Or a printed fabric?

05:39.560 --> 05:43.280
That would be better than
these depressing rags. Come on, help me.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.280
Instead of standing there doing nothing.
Come on. Hold the ladder.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.800
Hey.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.440
Have you heard from Nikki?
- No news is good news in Nikki's case.

06:01.080 --> 06:06.960
Yeah. I can't get hold of her.
- Oh, wow, I'm stiff.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.640
Mozes with his exercises and stuff.

06:11.680 --> 06:16.960
Romy? Romy? Not too high, sweetie.
- No, no.

06:17.160 --> 06:22.160
Help me with this. Help me fold
these rags up. No, either end...

06:22.840 --> 06:28.640
Mum, that little wooden house
in the woods, is it ours?

06:28.840 --> 06:32.920
Don't you remember? Grandpa used to
make his famous wine there.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.320
You weren't allowed in there.
Did you walk that far?

06:37.920 --> 06:40.480
Annemie,
don't roll your eyes like that.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.960
Next time take your phone and
that panic button with you.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.240
I don't want you to get lost, eh?
- Yeah.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.240
By the way, beyond there
is no longer ours.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.760
Mie? Mie, calm down.

06:55.720 --> 06:56.880
Romy?

07:01.880 --> 07:02.880
Romy?

07:03.360 --> 07:05.160
Romy?
- Boo.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.000
What are you doing?

07:11.040 --> 07:12.520
Come on, get up.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.280
Romy, that's not a very nice game, OK?
Do you hear me?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.200
Sorry.

07:23.440 --> 07:29.560
Here, Mummy. That's for you.
A little brain to make yours better.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.480
Hey.
- Hello, Mum.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.080
Look. To cheer the place up a bit.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.840
Ã…nd it's plastic
so you don't need to water it.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.280
Thanks.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.880
How's Romy?
- Fine, fine.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.640
And how are you?
Tell me.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.400
You look tired, sweetheart.
- Yes, I am tired.

08:02.720 --> 08:06.440
Isn't the therapy working?
What kind of therapy is it?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.480
Group therapy, craft therapy.
All sorts of stuff.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.040
They should organize
laughing therapy instead.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.760
Curtains like that are enough
to make anyone depressed.

08:19.920 --> 08:25.400
See? Dad always said a day you don't laugh
is a day you haven't lived.

08:31.400 --> 08:37.160
Who is this Thomas Spectre?
- Yeah... If only we knew.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.000
What have you got there? What's that?

08:43.720 --> 08:47.520
Hmm... Is he a relative of ours?

08:53.200 --> 08:57.320
A relative? An ugly little guy like that?
Where did you get it?

08:57.920 --> 09:00.520
And where is the other half?
- I don't know.

09:09.320 --> 09:12.200
How's Dad?
- Oh, don't ask. Not good, eh?

09:12.400 --> 09:15.560
Since Mozes left
it's all down to me again, of course.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.520
And Dad misses Mozes.
- Hmm.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.440
Yeah, yeah. Mozes.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.600
Mozes.

09:28.920 --> 09:33.000
2 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

09:46.400 --> 09:48.840
Walter? It's your turn.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.280
Turn over a card.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.040
A toadstool.
- Where's the other toadstool?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.080
Come on, Walter. You know.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.560
Walter?

10:15.600 --> 10:16.960
Walter?

10:18.040 --> 10:21.280
Come on. We can play now.
How about a shag?

10:21.480 --> 10:25.960
I mean brag.
- I only know... strip poker.

10:26.520 --> 10:30.360
Ohhh. Strip poker.
- Mmm hmm.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.280
Then you'll know
Walter's favourite game too.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.880
Strip memory. You start.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.520
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

10:52.600 --> 10:54.840
<i>There, your turn again.</i>

11:00.560 --> 11:04.200
Wrong. Take something off.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.160
Oh!

11:10.720 --> 11:15.880
OK. I think that's my Alzheimer's.
What do you want me to take off?

11:16.080 --> 11:21.240
Your bra.
- Mozes. My bra?

11:21.600 --> 11:26.760
Hey! You have to knock on the door
first before you are allowed in.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
Yes.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.480
It's me.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.080
Um...

11:37.760 --> 11:40.800
Sweetie? I'll be right there.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.280
Hey. What a surprise!
Hello, darling.

11:49.800 --> 11:55.840
Your blouse is on inside out.
- Really? I'm starting to take after Dad.

11:58.840 --> 12:02.680
I've brought you some home-made biscuits.
Your favourite biscuits.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.480
Coconut ones.

12:05.840 --> 12:08.640
Thanks, Mie-Mie.
- Take one.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.160
Did I have an argument with Nikki?
- Coffee?

12:19.440 --> 12:22.280
Mum, answer me. Did I have an argument
with Nikki, yes or no?

12:22.520 --> 12:27.560
You know your sister, sweetheart.
Two boys would've been a lot easier.

12:27.760 --> 12:33.320
Always nice to know you're welcome.
- I was just joking.

12:33.800 --> 12:39.880
Besides, you'll have forgotten tomorrow.
- Yeah? Like I'll forget what I just saw?

12:41.520 --> 12:45.520
Just a second.
Hello, Rita speaking.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.800
Hey, Dad.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.040
Hey, calm down.

12:50.480 --> 12:55.080
Can I have another biscuit?
- Of course you can have another one.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.560
I made them specially for you.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.800
Nikki, don't be so obstinate.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.880
It isn't easy for anyone
but you're making it worse.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.920
Don't tell me what to do, Mum. You might
get away with it with Mie but not with me.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.080
I'm not telling you what to do, just
trying to do my best for everyone so...

13:15.280 --> 13:19.560
Do your best for everyone?
All you do is manipulate everyone.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.440
Hey, Nikki.
- Butt out. She's a hypocritical bitch.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.160
I heard that.
- That was the idea.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.880
Rita, did I ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

13:29.080 --> 13:33.640
It's Mie, Dad. I'll clean
your glasses for you, shall I?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.200
Rita...

13:41.840 --> 13:46.760
You horny little minx.
- Dad, I'm Mie.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.000
Annemie. Your daughter.

13:51.960 --> 13:56.760
I have to go and collect Romy.
But I'll come and see you again soon, OK?

13:59.360 --> 14:00.960
Bye, Dad.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.640
Walter?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.560
Oh!
- Oh! Hey!

14:52.920 --> 14:55.880
What are you doing? Trying to kiss me?
- No.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.680
I was just trying to hear
what you were saying in your sleep.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.320
?
Who is Bob
- What? Bob?

15:06.520 --> 15:09.040
Bob, you always dream about
someone called Bob.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.400
I don't... I don't know
what you are on about. Sorry.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.320
Dreams are today's answers
to tomorrow's questions.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.960
Edgar Cayce, the Sleeping Prophet.

15:25.360 --> 15:29.360
Mie seems to have woken up in a bad mood.
- No, I want to get out of here.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.400
I miss my daughter.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.640
Is that all?
- What d'you mean, is that all?

15:39.840 --> 15:44.080
Oh, come on, Mrs D'Haeze. Eh?
Let's just chat a bit.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.960
It doesn't always have to be
sorrow and misery.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.840
OK.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.960
I'm in an institution and I miss
my daughter and my memory.

16:01.800 --> 16:06.440
OK. I'm in the loony bin and I miss
a daughter, my memory and...

16:07.400 --> 16:08.520
and my fireplace.

16:10.560 --> 16:15.120
OK, I'm in an institution and I miss...
- And matches. I miss matches.

16:15.320 --> 16:20.960
Matches. Oh, that sound.
Oh, that smell.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.680
Hey, Mie...
Can't you get me some matches? Eh?

16:29.040 --> 16:32.880
Via your husband or someone?
- Haven't you got your own family?

16:34.240 --> 16:36.200
Do you ever get visitors?

16:37.600 --> 16:40.560
Would you marry a pyromaniac?
- No.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.520
They are very fiery lovers.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.240
Sorry.
- Doesn't matter.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.960
My libido is flickering so weakly
it's almost gone out.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.560
I have other ambitions.
- Oh yeah?

16:56.760 --> 16:58.200
Yeah.

17:00.680 --> 17:05.200
Spontaneous combustion. Yeah.

17:08.040 --> 17:12.680
You just catch fire. A mysterious natural
phenomenon that actually exists.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.440
You burn from the inside out.
Suddenly.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.360
Without any flames.
And you turn completely to ashes.

17:23.320 --> 17:25.600
Only your legs are left.

17:27.680 --> 17:32.400
Spontaneous combustion is better than
a woman. Better than sex.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.720
Thank you.
- No, give here. I need them to read.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.200
Give here.
- No.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
Give.
- They're mine.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.720
Give here.
- I need them.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.400
Come on.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.800
Mie, come with me. You've got a visitor.
- Oh? OK.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.440
You really are crazy.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.880
Here. Don't worry.
There will be pudding later.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.040
Inspector Wolkers.

18:19.560 --> 18:24.800
The doctors don't want to risk you
browbeating her again so I'm staying too.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.480
Sorry about the misunderstanding
last time.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.840
That's OK.
- All forgiven and forgotten.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.800
You seem to be good friends
with your stalker.

18:47.280 --> 18:51.600
Uh, sorry, Inspector Wolkers,
but we were going to take it easy.

18:52.200 --> 18:58.160
I mean...
You look happy in this photo, eh?

18:59.560 --> 19:01.120
That's you, isn't it?

19:04.520 --> 19:06.960
It seems you did know Spectre well
after all.

19:07.680 --> 19:13.680
Yes, so it seems.
But I don't remember. Sorry.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.720
Oops.
- Mummy?

19:16.920 --> 19:19.080
2 MONTHS BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE

19:19.280 --> 19:22.000
Mummy?
- Shhh, sweetie, don't be scared.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.640
Mummy?
- Got it.

19:25.280 --> 19:30.560
I'm just going down into the cellar...
- I don't want to stay here alone, Mummy.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.720
Hold on. Where are they?

19:38.320 --> 19:40.280
OK, hold this a moment.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.920
OK. Right. I'll be straight back.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.680
What are you doing here?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.800
I was scared.

20:50.320 --> 20:56.320
Sorry. Sorry, sweetie. There's no need
to be scared. Eh? Come on.

20:57.320 --> 21:02.840
You don't need to be scared.
It's just a very old house.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.120
How about if we see
how many lights we can turn on?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.160
And then we'll reheat our dinner.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.840
There you are.
- Thank you.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.360
It's not too hot?
- No.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.640
What's the matter?
- I want some Go-Gurt.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.880
You'll change into Go-Gurt, you will.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.080
Just this once. OK?

21:52.240 --> 21:53.760
I haven't got any Go-Gurt.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.360
You were going to get some
from the shop.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.480
I know but I forgot. Sorry.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.720
You forget everything.
You do it on purpose.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.960
Eat.
- I want some Go-Gurt.

22:19.520 --> 22:22.880
Come on.
- No, I want to stay in the car.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.040
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Shut the door.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.640
Yes, boss.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.280
Good evening
.
- Hello, Mie.

23:15.080 --> 23:18.120
We had a drink together recently
in that bar.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.680
You gave me a drawing. Remember?

23:23.400 --> 23:26.040
Tom. From the recycling centre.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.280
Oh yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, hello.
- No. You don't remember.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.360
Sorry.
- Doesn't matter.

23:37.280 --> 23:41.280
Don't take it personally because I can't
remember what I came to buy either.

23:41.480 --> 23:47.600
Milk maybe?
- No, that wasn't it. But thanks.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.520
Right, goodbye.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.560
Washing detergent?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.000
No.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.800
Sugar?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.880
Honey?
- No.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.280
Maybe it was... coffee?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.320
You don't give up, do you?
- No.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.760
No, it wasn't that either
but it doesn't go off so...

24:52.360 --> 24:53.960
Sorry.

24:59.960 --> 25:04.720
Are you doing anything tomorrow? I'd like
to show you something. If... If you want.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.800
I think it was this.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.040
3 o'clock tomorrow.
At the recycling centre?

25:22.080 --> 25:23.040
I'll see.

25:23.240 --> 25:27.040
You'll see. 3 o'clock recycling centre.
Put it in your phone.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.280
Goodnight.
- Bye.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.040
Go-Gurt.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.360
Oh!

25:55.960 --> 25:59.480
Why are you in here in the dark?
- Why were you in the all-night store?

26:00.480 --> 26:03.160
This late at night.
You know I don't like you doing that.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.640
Romy?
- Yes?

26:05.840 --> 26:08.080
Go on upstairs. I'm coming.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.960
How do you know where I was?
- Our tracking app.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.800
Are you checking on me?

26:17.000 --> 26:22.560
We installed it together. When you got
lost for the umpteenth time. Remember?

26:28.600 --> 26:31.800
This isn't always easy for me either, Mie.
I'd appreciate it...

26:32.000 --> 26:36.600
You sound just like my mother.
- Are you going to bed?

26:38.320 --> 26:40.720
No, I'm going to put our daughter to bed.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.440
Unless you want to do it for a change.

26:59.720 --> 27:04.560
IS BENOIT CHECKING ON ME?

27:08.160 --> 27:14.480
TOOTHPASTE

RECYCLING CENTRE

27:43.000 --> 27:44.560
What are you doing?

27:47.440 --> 27:50.440
You have to go to
the recycling centre again?

27:53.600 --> 27:57.520
Why?
- We've just been.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.200
Yes, but there's still a load of stuff
in the cellar.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.720
Goodnight.

28:35.400 --> 28:39.320
Never forget I love you, eh?

28:42.160 --> 28:44.880
That was my fault. Sorry.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.360
TODAY
6 DECEMBER

28:47.560 --> 28:51.160
No one likes being in the dark.
That includes me.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.920
There's nothing in the photo
you recognize?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.600
The background maybe?

29:03.520 --> 29:04.720
No.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.160
Sorry, I have to get this.

29:22.920 --> 29:29.840
DID TOM FOLLOW ME?
APPOINTMENT RECYCLING CENTRE

29:30.360 --> 29:32.480
Where are you?
- At work, chief.

29:32.680 --> 29:37.480
When is a guy the ultimate workaholic?
When he forgets his own retirement party.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.720
Guys, D-cup Debby is here.
- Did you hear that?

29:40.920 --> 29:43.080
Show us your tits.
- You'll miss your surprise.

29:43.280 --> 29:47.360
I heard. Have fun with Debby.
I've got a case to solve.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.840
And when do you think
you will have done so?

29:50.040 --> 29:53.640
By the end of the week, chief.
Before I clear out my desk.

29:53.840 --> 29:57.120
It's time you started enjoying life, pal.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.040
My, uh... My apologies.

30:11.800 --> 30:15.960
Right, Mrs D'Haeze, where were we?

30:17.480 --> 30:22.160
So you can't remember anything about
that Polaroid with Thomas Spectre?

30:24.960 --> 30:26.480
Birds.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.920
There weren't any birds.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.160
3 PM APPOINTMENT
RECYCLING CENTRE

31:20.920 --> 31:24.600
I got that from you.
- Did you?

31:30.800 --> 31:32.680
That's my plant refuge.

31:40.920 --> 31:45.760
That's my other project.
The... The bear pit.

31:46.760 --> 31:51.120
I put them all on here.
On a forum.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.960
FOUND BEARS

31:53.160 --> 31:55.160
So people can find them.

31:59.720 --> 32:04.920
If you ever need me, I don't have a phone
but you can contact me via this site.

32:05.880 --> 32:09.680
Put it in your phone.
- Oh yeah.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.320
Um...

32:14.760 --> 32:20.120
May I take a picture too?
- No, no. I don't make a good photo.

32:20.720 --> 32:23.400
I'm not very good at... at posing.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.480
OK. But then I will forget you again.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.480
I've got something better.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.840
Next time we meet...

32:41.160 --> 32:43.440
and you're not sure if you know me...

32:44.160 --> 32:48.080
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

32:57.640 --> 32:59.200
<i>What's this?</i>

33:00.000 --> 33:03.920
That's proof I stopped.
Would you like a drink, by the way?

33:04.240 --> 33:08.040
Sure. A glass of water or something.
- Take a seat.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.400
Thank you.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.200
Is that your mum?
- Yes.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.800
Is she still alive?

33:25.720 --> 33:30.520
No. She died a few years ago.
- Oh. Sorry.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.680
That's OK.
- Thank you.

33:36.320 --> 33:41.120
And your dad?
- He walked out on us when I was about 4.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.040
So you never knew him.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.040
He came to see me on my 17th birthday.

33:49.960 --> 33:56.080
He came to poke his nose in... You know.
Came to tell me I was heading for trouble.

33:56.280 --> 34:00.240
He was suddenly going to find me a job.
- Hmm.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.280
I told him...

34:04.920 --> 34:08.240
That he could kiss my...
- Arse.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.800
You got it.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.320
What about you?
Did you have more luck?

34:17.160 --> 34:22.480
Yes. I did. Yes.
- You don't sound that certain.

34:23.440 --> 34:27.280
No. I've got a fantastic Dad
but he's got Alzheimer's.

34:28.240 --> 34:31.560
Oh...
- And my mum...

34:32.200 --> 34:37.480
The curtain consultant. Architect.
- Something like that.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.760
My mum does her best.

34:42.560 --> 34:45.800
Shall I send her along?
- Uh, yeah.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.720
I feel like I've known you for ages.

34:58.560 --> 35:02.160
Well, yeah, from... from here at
the recycling centre. And in that bar.

35:02.360 --> 35:06.480
And from at the all-night store.
But you've forgotten that so...

35:07.600 --> 35:10.960
No. It's more than that.

35:13.280 --> 35:18.440
As if I know you from a different life.
D'you get what I mean?

35:18.640 --> 35:19.960
Hmm.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.040
I just feel at ease with you.
That's it.

35:35.560 --> 35:36.520
Come on.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.040
Right.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.960
Honey.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.080
Honeybird?

36:20.640 --> 36:22.880
<i>Hello, is it me you're looking for?</i>

36:23.080 --> 36:28.360
<i>Leave a message after the beep
so I don't forget to call you back. Bye.</i>

36:42.760 --> 36:44.440
<i>Oh.</i>

36:47.080 --> 36:50.440
Hello, Benoit speaking.
- Hi, Bennie. You old git.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.000
Hello, Ollie.
- Happy birthday, mate.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.560
Thank you, thank you.
- From Nikki too.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.040
Hmm.
- Going to celebrate tonight? Eh?

36:58.240 --> 37:01.800
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mie is busy
cooking up a storm for me.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.800
Lucky bastard. Have a great evening, man.
- Thanks, Ollie.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.840
Bye.
- Bye, Ollie. Bye-bye.

37:34.040 --> 37:40.560
"Weekend in Paris... Say you have to go
to a conference. Happy birthday. xxx V."

37:40.760 --> 37:44.040
Christ, don't do this.
Mie could've found it.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.440
It still works?

38:23.360 --> 38:24.640
May I see?

38:49.360 --> 38:53.840
Hey? What's up?
- Nothing.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.440
A bit tired.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.920
Shall we go to bed? Eh?
- Hmm.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.160
There it is again.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.680
Benoit? That light. Look.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.360
Something weird is going on.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.200
There you go.

39:28.680 --> 39:32.000
I shouldn't have got rid of
Grandpa's mirror.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.760
Eh?
- Hmm.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.080
There aren't any birds here.

39:48.040 --> 39:51.160
There aren't any birds here.
- No.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.000
There aren't any birds here.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.640
No. We live in the middle of woods
and I've never heard a bird.

39:58.840 --> 40:02.000
I've never seen one either.
Have you?

40:03.640 --> 40:05.800
I don't know, Mie. I don't know.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.280
Benoit. Benoit?

40:10.760 --> 40:16.280
Look. Look. There's no need to behave
like that. That's not normal, is it?

40:16.640 --> 40:23.560
Normal? Could you be normal for once?
For one evening? Could you? Just once?

40:39.080 --> 40:40.480
Sorry.

40:45.040 --> 40:48.040
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

40:56.240 --> 41:01.960
It's the move. It's all just...
all just been a bit much.

41:11.200 --> 41:15.880
Maybe you should...
contact Dr Mommaerts again.

41:19.080 --> 41:23.480
Those sessions really helped you
after the accident. Eh?

41:23.680 --> 41:26.840
I don't feel like seeing
any psychiatrists and doctors.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.120
I'm going to bed.
- Right.

42:02.880 --> 42:07.520
<i>Don't you... forget about me.</i>

42:16.320 --> 42:17.840
<i>Benoit?</i>

42:18.040 --> 42:21.960
Yeah?
- There's a dead animal in the toilet.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.960
Where?
- I flushed it away already.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.240
What kind of animal?

42:29.640 --> 42:31.560
A bird.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.720
What?
There was a dead bird in the toilet.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.840
Yeah, yeah.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.200
Hi, Benoit.
- Hi, Nikki.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.880
Is Mie here? I've come to make amends.
- Yes.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.520
Hi.
- Hi.

42:52.520 --> 42:54.800
Long time no see. Hi.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.960
How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.800
I've come to kidnap you
for some Mie and me time.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.520
Really? I'm doing something with Romy.
- I'm here too.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.520
Seriously?
- Go on, get out of here.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.520
I'll go and get changed.
I'll be right back. Thanks.

43:11.600 --> 43:16.280
Don't say anything about that smack.
I think she has forgotten it.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.160
Was it a nice meal last night?

43:38.400 --> 43:41.040
What? What? Nothing special.
Just the usual.

43:41.240 --> 43:44.040
Oh, because Ollie said
you were cooking up a storm for Benoit.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.320
No, I think Benoit cooked.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.680
That's nice,
letting the birthday boy cook.

43:51.920 --> 43:56.200
Birthday boy? It wasn't Benoit's birthday.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.920
Was that yesterday?

44:03.320 --> 44:04.440
Shit.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.040
Why didn't he tell me?

44:13.240 --> 44:16.840
He probably didn't want
to make things even harder for you.

44:17.040 --> 44:20.560
You'd mention something like that.
- You don't always mention everything.

44:20.760 --> 44:25.000
If Benoit were to forget my birthday,
he'd hear about it!

44:29.200 --> 44:31.240
Maybe he's got something on his mind.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.880
I never know
what's going on in his head.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.960
Things aren't going too well.

44:51.320 --> 44:56.240
He's away a lot, for work.
I'm always home alone with Romy.

44:57.440 --> 45:01.320
Maybe you should get out more?
- What am I doing now?

45:01.520 --> 45:05.000
Going fishing with your sister
doesn't count.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.120
How many people do you see from before?

45:08.560 --> 45:10.560
There you go.

45:11.920 --> 45:15.840
I meet other people here.
- Who?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.760
Tom, for example.

45:19.680 --> 45:21.400
Tom?
- Mmm hmm.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.520
It's very strange. I feel like
I've known him for a long time.

45:25.720 --> 45:29.760
It's not true. And I meet him
and I forget who he is. It's...

45:29.960 --> 45:33.000
I can't explain.
- What do you know about this Tom?

45:35.040 --> 45:37.040
That he's good-looking.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.880
Hey!
Be careful.

45:43.360 --> 45:47.320
TODAY
6 DECEMBER

45:47.880 --> 45:49.720
You've remembered something?

45:53.080 --> 45:55.360
No.
- I can see it in your face.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.040
I forgot his birthday.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.400
Whose birthday?

46:04.680 --> 46:07.200
Benoit's. My husband's.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.280
Right.

46:13.920 --> 46:17.400
I think it's time we went for a walk.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.200
A walk?
- Yes.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.840
W... Why?
- I want to show you something.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.240
Uh... I don't think you can just do that.

46:24.640 --> 46:29.360
Dr Devos knows. It's some way from here.
We'll be back in an hour.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.880
Meanwhile you can knit another hat.

46:44.080 --> 46:48.680
How come you always talk about your
husband when I ask about Thomas Spectre?

46:48.880 --> 46:52.200
I don't know. Do you think...

46:53.080 --> 46:56.040
I'm a good wife?
- Pardon?

46:56.240 --> 46:58.000
A good wife to my husband.

46:59.600 --> 47:03.000
I wouldn't know.
I'm not married to you.

47:05.720 --> 47:07.600
But I am a good mother?

47:10.560 --> 47:16.120
Mrs D'Haeze, I'm only a cop.
Not a psychiatrist.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.320
Have you got children?

47:28.240 --> 47:34.400
Parents fuck up their kids.
Not on purpose, but they do.

47:35.360 --> 47:37.560
We can only do our best.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.600
Parents fuck up their kids.

47:45.800 --> 47:52.760
Two, three, four, five,

47:52.960 --> 47:57.800
six, seven, eight

47:58.880 --> 48:04.440
nine, ten.
Coming ready or not.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.320
<i>Hey, Red Riding Hood,
where are you going</i>

48:09.520 --> 48:12.720
<i>on your own?
On your own...</i>

48:12.920 --> 48:16.400
<i>Hey, Red Riding Hood,
where are you going...</i>

48:24.000 --> 48:29.160
<i>Better be careful, the wolf is coming
Better be...</i>

48:57.200 --> 48:58.640
<i>Romy?</i>

49:20.560 --> 49:22.480
Hi, Benoit.
- Hi, honeybird.

49:22.680 --> 49:28.200
Have you done the shopping? Eh?
- Yes, I've already been to the shop.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.760
OK, then I'll come straight come.
See you soon.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.160
Hi.
- Hi.

49:40.440 --> 49:45.600
Have a nice day?
- Yes. We played with the puppets.

49:46.960 --> 49:48.480
When's dinner ready?

49:49.200 --> 49:50.480
Uh...

49:51.720 --> 49:53.600
In half an hour.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.400
Half an hour?

49:57.160 --> 50:03.360
You forgot me. I'm never playing
with you again. I hate you.

50:03.560 --> 50:04.720
My little angel...

50:11.160 --> 50:12.720
TODAY
6 DECEMBER

50:12.920 --> 50:15.720
If you recognize anything, tell me.

50:16.960 --> 50:20.120
This is where you were last seen
with Thomas Spectre.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.960
They are just woods like any others.
Sorry.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.080
Come on. We're almost there.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.440
I've been here before.
- With Thomas?

51:10.640 --> 51:12.880
I don't know...
I don't think so, no.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.120
Is this yours?
- Uh...

51:33.320 --> 51:36.600
My team found this here.
A cape.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.840
No.
- Are you sure? It doesn't seem familiar?

51:44.040 --> 51:45.960
No. Sorry.

51:46.160 --> 51:50.920
Right. Take your time.
Have a look around.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.240
Wolkers speaking.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.960
Yeah, yeah. Yes, she's here with me.

52:25.040 --> 52:30.720
Right. Sorry, Dr Devos.
Then it's a misunderstanding. Bye.

52:37.720 --> 52:40.760
I don't remember anything specific.
Sorry.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.840
Who saw me here with Thomas?

52:47.040 --> 52:52.040
A witness.
Not in here. Out in the woods.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.360
Who?
- I can't tell you that.

52:57.600 --> 53:01.520
Come on. We have to go.
They miss you apparently.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.840
NEXT TIME

53:39.040 --> 53:40.520
We're going to do a quiz.

53:40.720 --> 53:43.320
Something or someone is hounding us here.

53:43.520 --> 53:45.520
Are you suffering from amnesia?
- Yes.

53:46.120 --> 53:48.520
Wood absorbs. Wood doesn't forget.

53:48.720 --> 53:53.640
I'm scared of my child. The house is doing
something to her. There's something here.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.240
Don't hesitate, they can feel it.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.760
Liars need a good memory.

53:58.960 --> 54:03.000
Are you going to wreck your brain
completely with this hocus-pocus bullshit?

54:05.040 --> 54:07.560
Is Thomas Spectre still alive?
