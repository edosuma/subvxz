Think about Ziva.
Kate lives,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.478
Ziva would have
stayed Mossad.

12:12.521 --> 12:14.130
Be careful with this one.

12:14.173 --> 12:16.043
I know her father well.

12:16.086 --> 12:19.043
To say she's dangerous is
an understatement.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.652
Dangerous women are
my specialty, Leon.

12:20.695 --> 12:23.217
Oh, I'm familiar
with your specialty, Tony.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.565
I remember you.

12:25.608 --> 12:29.217
Riva? Viza?

12:29.260 --> 12:30.347
No, no, no, no.

12:30.391 --> 12:31.478
Tiva.

12:31.521 --> 12:35.043
Ziva. My name is Ziva David.

12:35.086 --> 12:37.043
[chuckles]

12:37.086 --> 12:41.434
Oh, yeah... Ziva,
the icy Israeli.

12:41.478 --> 12:44.913
I followed you
to a hotel pool once.

12:44.956 --> 12:46.695
Clearly, I made an impression.

12:46.739 --> 12:49.043
Cannot say the same about you.

12:49.086 --> 12:53.565
No way. No, you're not blaming
me for everything.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.521
I didn't say everything.

12:55.565 --> 12:57.913
But we're just as
responsible

12:57.956 --> 13:01.173
for the things we do
as the things we don't.

13:01.217 --> 13:03.260
Yesterday was
an eye-opener.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.391
There was more to that case
than you saw coming.

13:08.782 --> 13:10.434
This can't be good.
Cleaned out his desk, too.

13:10.478 --> 13:13.434
Albatross!
Albatross!

13:13.478 --> 13:15.869
Petty Officer Janet McCaffrey
had a spotless record.

13:15.913 --> 13:18.043
ZIVA:
Uh, two deployments on
two different ships:

13:18.086 --> 13:20.434
the Ontario
and the Gentry.

13:20.478 --> 13:22.782
So it's
finally happened.

13:22.826 --> 13:25.000
You two are snooping together
as a team.

13:25.043 --> 13:28.043
We are merely curious
and concerned.

13:28.086 --> 13:29.565
Well, it's nothing
you need to know about.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.043
There's plenty I need
to know about.

13:31.086 --> 13:32.173
Like our dead petty officer.

13:32.217 --> 13:33.869
Pulled our victim's bank
records, boss.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.391
Two deposits in the last week.

13:35.434 --> 13:37.391
Both over $30,000.From where?

13:37.434 --> 13:39.347
Still checking.Civilian?

13:39.391 --> 13:42.043
Peter Germaine. Still in the ICU
at Washington General.

13:42.086 --> 13:44.043
Background?

13:44.086 --> 13:46.043
McGEE: Germaine works
for a shipbuilding firm

13:46.086 --> 13:47.043
out of Portsmouth.

13:47.086 --> 13:48.565
His company was
just absorbed

13:48.608 --> 13:51.000
by a Hong Kong-based
electronics company.

13:51.043 --> 13:52.434
The Chinese.

13:52.478 --> 13:54.913
Takeover's still pending.
There's a security concern

13:54.956 --> 13:58.000
regarding a foreign
entity operating on a
U.S. military installation.

13:58.043 --> 13:59.608
And before any ship
undergoes repairs,

13:59.652 --> 14:01.434
sensitive information is
supposed to be removed.

14:01.478 --> 14:02.869
Including most hard drives.

14:02.913 --> 14:05.043
Most?Well, according
to the data logs,

14:05.086 --> 14:07.478
the Gentry'ssurveillance drives
are still intact.

14:07.521 --> 14:09.000
[phone rings]Treason, boss?

14:09.043 --> 14:11.695
Could be our two shooters had
an agreement that went sour.

14:11.739 --> 14:12.913
Sweet and sour.

14:12.956 --> 14:14.478
We need to talk
to those Chinese.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.434
Exactly.I'll tell Director Vance.

14:16.478 --> 14:19.043
Yeah, Abbs, I'm on the way.

14:19.086 --> 14:20.956
[grunting]

14:23.043 --> 14:26.130
Hey, Gibbs. You feel better,
Jimmy, or should I do it again?

14:27.304 --> 14:28.347
Do what again?

14:28.391 --> 14:29.608
Sorry, Agent Gibbs.

14:29.652 --> 14:31.043
I pulled my oblique

14:31.086 --> 14:34.043
while extracting
Petty Officer McCaffrey

14:34.086 --> 14:36.652
down the ladder off the Gentry,
and, uh,

14:36.695 --> 14:38.478
Abby's been Rolfing me.

14:38.521 --> 14:40.434
Rolfing you?

14:40.478 --> 14:43.391
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

14:43.434 --> 14:45.217
Uh...

14:45.260 --> 14:48.260
I'm gonna go down
to Autopsy.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.173
Rolfing, Abbs?

14:50.217 --> 14:54.260
So, um, Ducky and Jimmy dug out
the two slugs

14:54.304 --> 14:56.043
that killed Petty Officer
McCaffrey

14:56.086 --> 14:57.695
and the round found in

14:57.739 --> 14:59.217
our wounded civilian
Peter Germaine.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.347
I analyzed and compared
all three.

15:02.391 --> 15:03.652
And guess what?

15:03.695 --> 15:05.913
They all look the same.Exactly.

15:05.956 --> 15:09.782
All three slugs came
from the same gun, this one.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.347
Someone else shot them, Gibbs,
and then they left the gun

15:12.391 --> 15:14.304
there to make it look like
Germaine did it.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.956
The Glock registered, Abbs?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.347
Nope. And the serial number is
filed off.

15:18.391 --> 15:22.347
So when I wasn't Rolfing
Jimmy, I was able

15:22.391 --> 15:24.434
to lift a partial latent
print off the casing.

15:24.478 --> 15:27.043
[typing]Meet... Michael Rose.

15:27.086 --> 15:29.000
Freelance systems analyst.

15:29.043 --> 15:31.130
Does a lot of work
with Navy Intel.

15:31.173 --> 15:34.043
All three had
clearance to board.

15:34.086 --> 15:36.043
Maybe they were all
in it together.

15:36.086 --> 15:37.608
Nice work.

15:37.652 --> 15:41.043
Who knew Palmer had
abs like that?

15:41.086 --> 15:42.869
[dials phone]

15:42.913 --> 15:43.869
DiNozzo?Yeah, boss?

15:43.913 --> 15:45.130
We know no one
left the ship.

15:45.173 --> 15:48.043
We're looking for Michael Rose.
Find him.

15:48.086 --> 15:50.913
Well, you can forget it,
'cause I'm not taking the blame

15:50.956 --> 15:53.565
for every coulda,
shoulda, didn't, Mike.

15:55.391 --> 15:56.913
I-I... I didn't order this.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.652
Well, sometimes
we don't know

15:59.695 --> 16:03.000
what we want till someone
shows us the possibilities.

16:04.652 --> 16:09.043
Chocolate.
My mom used to do this.

16:10.608 --> 16:12.043
What'd you say your name was?

16:12.086 --> 16:13.608
Ann.

16:13.652 --> 16:16.826
That was my mother's name.

16:34.043 --> 16:36.652
Hurt my feelings
if you don't eat it.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.826
No, I can't...

16:39.869 --> 16:42.260
Mom.

16:42.304 --> 16:45.000
Poor thing.

16:45.043 --> 16:47.652
Brain must be running
in circles trying

16:47.695 --> 16:49.304
to make sense of all this.

16:49.347 --> 16:52.043
And here I am, not a day older
than the last time you saw me

16:52.086 --> 16:54.565
carrying on about
a mother's pride.

16:54.608 --> 16:56.043
My goodness.

16:56.086 --> 16:58.347
You never told me
you were proud.

16:58.391 --> 17:01.173
Proud of the boy
I knew,

17:01.217 --> 17:04.608
proud of the man you've become,

17:04.652 --> 17:07.869
and proud of everything
in-between.

17:07.913 --> 17:10.913
How about I wrap this up?

17:10.956 --> 17:13.956
You can take it
home with you.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.173
Do I get to go home?

17:18.869 --> 17:20.521
Eventually.

17:20.565 --> 17:23.869
I do have one bone
to pick with you, though.

17:23.913 --> 17:25.695
MAN:
It's dangerous!

17:25.739 --> 17:27.565
What?! You never...You could've cut him
some slack.

17:27.608 --> 17:29.608
Why won't you
do what I ask?!

17:29.652 --> 17:32.608
Dad blamed you for everything.
He hated you for leaving.

17:32.652 --> 17:36.913
Well, trust me,

17:36.956 --> 17:38.956
he had one foot out
the door already.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.739
So, he drove a few women home.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.173
God knows, I put your father
through hell.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.826
Man that age shouldn't be
changing

17:49.869 --> 17:51.739
his wife's bed sheets
every night.

17:51.782 --> 17:53.043
Best thing
I did was go.

17:53.086 --> 17:56.695
No, don't you say that.

17:56.739 --> 17:59.043
It's true.

17:59.086 --> 18:01.000
Course, raising
a son is hard,

18:01.043 --> 18:03.478
but doing it
on your own,

18:03.521 --> 18:05.000
you're gonna need
a couple miracles

18:05.043 --> 18:06.826
for things to turn out right.

18:06.869 --> 18:08.347
[door closes]

18:09.478 --> 18:12.173
Just ask Michael Rose.

18:14.217 --> 18:16.043
Tell me about Michael Rose.

18:16.086 --> 18:18.869
McGEE: 42, lives in
McLean, Virginia.

18:18.913 --> 18:22.086
Divorced. Single dad.
Computer systems analyst

18:22.130 --> 18:24.043
for the government, which
evidently doesn't pay

18:24.086 --> 18:26.608
well enough, because Rose has
some major money problems.

18:26.652 --> 18:29.000
No money in his
checking account

18:29.043 --> 18:30.739
and he's facing foreclosure on
his home.

18:30.782 --> 18:32.043
Rose has a son
named Stephen.

18:32.086 --> 18:35.608
He's 17 years old.
An honor student who is

18:35.652 --> 18:36.652
currently applying
to colleges.

18:36.695 --> 18:37.826
Son's bank account?

18:37.869 --> 18:39.391
Only a savings account
listed, boss.

18:39.434 --> 18:41.782
New deposits?
Rose deposited

18:41.826 --> 18:44.173
$20,000
48 hours ago.

18:44.217 --> 18:46.043
I talked to his coworkers.
They haven't seen him,

18:46.086 --> 18:47.782
and his voicemail is full.

18:47.826 --> 18:48.782
Outgoing calls?

18:48.826 --> 18:50.434
Three last night.

18:50.478 --> 18:53.913
One to his son, the other two to
secure diplomatic lines in D.C.

18:53.956 --> 18:55.652
The Chinese embassy.

18:55.695 --> 18:56.956
Ziva, go find
this kid.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.173
McGee, get back to the Gentry.

18:59.217 --> 19:02.260
Find DiNozzo.
Help him locate
Michael Rose.

19:03.652 --> 19:04.826
TONY:
Computer monitors,

19:04.869 --> 19:07.608
clandestine meetings
in Vance's office.

19:07.652 --> 19:10.000
You're up to something,
McDevious,

19:10.043 --> 19:11.869
I can tell.
Wait a second.

19:11.913 --> 19:14.695
Are you finally getting
that sex-change operation?

19:14.739 --> 19:16.173
Good for you, McGee.

19:16.217 --> 19:18.173
Or is it McShe?
No judgment.

19:18.217 --> 19:20.478
I'm proud of you.

19:20.521 --> 19:23.869
Look, Director Vance offered
me a job promotion, okay?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.913
As head of
the Cyber Division in Okinawa.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.956
That's it?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.826
Yes.

19:28.869 --> 19:30.608
Everybody knows that, Tim.

19:30.652 --> 19:31.869
Good for you.
It's fantastic.

19:31.913 --> 19:33.391
You got to take
that opportunity.

19:33.434 --> 19:36.391
The last cyber-agent,
he's at Microsoft now.

19:36.434 --> 19:38.608
Yeah, as head of security.
The guy's a rock star.

19:38.652 --> 19:40.869
Let's not get carried away,
but yeah.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.913
Why are you being
so normal about this?

19:47.521 --> 19:49.608
Your sincerity's
disconcerting.

19:49.652 --> 19:51.739
You prefer I'd
attack you with some kind

19:51.782 --> 19:53.217
of sarcastic,
hostile remark?

19:53.260 --> 19:54.043
Sort of, yeah.

19:54.086 --> 19:55.913
Mmm.

19:55.956 --> 19:58.043
What do I do?

19:58.086 --> 20:01.043
It's your choice.

20:01.086 --> 20:03.478
But I'd trust my gut.
That's what Gibbs would do.

20:20.173 --> 20:21.391
See ya.All right, man.

20:21.434 --> 20:24.913
Stephen Rose?

20:24.956 --> 20:27.043
Hey, Stephen,
we need to talk.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.260
I do not play lacrosse.

20:33.304 --> 20:35.043
Who are you?

20:35.086 --> 20:36.434
NCIS.

20:36.478 --> 20:39.695
[sighs]
Look, lady, I'm sorry.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.826
My dad said I have
to protect myself.

20:41.869 --> 20:43.869
From whom?

20:43.913 --> 20:47.000
[panting]:
The Chinese.

20:47.043 --> 20:50.000
He said we might
have trouble.

20:50.043 --> 20:52.608
ANN: Trouble connecting
the dots, Jethro?

20:52.652 --> 20:54.043
The newspaper,

20:54.086 --> 20:57.565
what's it say?

20:57.608 --> 20:59.043
Blank.

20:59.086 --> 21:00.347
Hm.

21:00.391 --> 21:02.000
That's 'cause you
haven't decided yet.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.782
I haven't decided what?

21:03.826 --> 21:06.217
How things will play out.

21:06.260 --> 21:09.956
See, it's all
intertwined, Jethro.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.347
You'd be surprised how one
decision ripples into another.

21:15.434 --> 21:17.739
It's your ship to sail, son.

21:22.956 --> 21:25.173
I didn't pull
the trigger yet.

21:25.217 --> 21:28.652
Hmm, nope, sure didn't.

21:32.391 --> 21:35.043
[sighs]

21:35.086 --> 21:39.043
I wish I'd known
all this before.

21:39.086 --> 21:41.043
Learned from it.

21:44.043 --> 21:46.000
Doesn't work
that way, son.

21:50.173 --> 21:53.826
Well, like it or not, you made
a difference in folks' lives.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Certainly did mine.

22:01.478 --> 22:03.478
Albeit short.

22:06.956 --> 22:10.000
I never wanted
to leave you.

22:12.826 --> 22:16.521
Tell me you
know that.

22:16.565 --> 22:19.086
Yeah.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.000
Yeah, I-I know that.

22:45.043 --> 22:47.173
McCALLISTER:
What are you in the
mood for, Gibbs?

22:47.217 --> 22:50.826
Rock? Jazz?

22:50.869 --> 22:54.434
Always been a big
band fan myself.

22:54.478 --> 22:55.826
Let me guess.

22:55.869 --> 22:57.739
After all this
nonsense today,

22:57.782 --> 22:59.913
you're more interested
in a choir of angels?

22:59.956 --> 23:00.956
Who are you, Riley?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.043
You the ghost of NCIS past?

23:03.086 --> 23:04.521
Please.

23:04.565 --> 23:06.478
You think I wanted
to be here?

23:06.521 --> 23:08.043
Nobody invited you.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.826
Oh, think again.
