WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.710
- Mwah!
- Okay, I've fed you.

00:04.772 --> 00:07.719
Now, who's ready
to watch some basketball?

00:07.775 --> 00:09.516
- Why am I looking at you?
- I don't know.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.456
Unlike you, I don't need a reason to watch
a bunch of guys run around in shorts.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.720
Don't ruin this for me
like you did with Olympic diving.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.193
- Cam?
- Recording it.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.753
Mitch and I are taking Alex and Manny
to an art exhibit.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.628
But, of course,
everybody is welcome to join.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.965
It's a retrospective
on postwar abstract expressionism.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.164
- Wait. For school?
- No, for life.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.969
Oh, thank God. I don't even know
who we fought in the postwar.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.408
Told you one car was enough.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.502
- Looks like it's just the two amigos.
- Haley?

00:33.567 --> 00:36.343
Oh, sorry to brunch and bail,
Grandpa, but I've got a date.

00:36.404 --> 00:39.317
- Uh, with whom?
- A gorgeous guy I met at school.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.649
- Ooh, goes there or cleans there?
- Mom.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.552
- Answer the question.
- So everyone's leaving?

00:43.611 --> 00:47.081
- No, I'm- I'm not.
- I wish I had known this before I served the good bacon.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.855
You did not serve the good bacon.

00:48.916 --> 00:53.797
- Shh! Don't you have a tiny dress to buy?
- Yes, we do!

00:53.854 --> 00:56.767
We asked Gloria to take Lily
to pick out her flower girl dress.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.430
Yeah. We're clearly not following
every wedding tradition...

00:59.493 --> 01:03.339
but there will damn sure be one dress
the grooms don't see until the big day.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.844
And we also asked Claire to go
because we thought her sensible style...

01:06.901 --> 01:09.040
nicely complements Gloria's flair.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.583
That way Lily doesn't
end up looking too-

01:13.207 --> 01:16.677
Or too-  ♪ Wah-wah ♪

01:17.745 --> 01:19.622
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:19.680 --> 01:21.717
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:21.782 --> 01:23.819
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:23.884 --> 01:25.795
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:25.853 --> 01:27.127
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:30.858 --> 01:32.394
There's my boy.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.033
I know you're talking to Joe,
but that still feels really good to hear.

01:36.097 --> 01:39.135
Okay, clocking out. Ch-Ch- Boop!

01:39.200 --> 01:42.079
You know, Andy, if you want,
you can stay and watch the game.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.377
Otherwise, I'll just be here by myself.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.076
I'm right here.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.051
I'd love to, Mr. P...

01:48.109 --> 01:50.817
but I gotta come up with
an anniversary gift for my girlfriend.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.482
I make her something
different every year...

01:52.546 --> 01:54.753
like a scrapbook or a nice scarf.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.694
This year, I was thinking
maybe I could bake her some banana bread.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.288
Oh, I am the king of banana bread.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.493
You know my secret? No nuts.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.263
Not such a secret.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.305
I used to make stuff
for Claire all the time.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.362
Pretty sure my artistry
is what locked her down.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.965
I got to make this year special.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.408
With her in the coast guard,
I, like, hardly ever get to see her.

02:12.466 --> 02:17.108
Well, this is just off the dome,
but, uh, maybe send her a fun video?

02:17.171 --> 02:20.414
Ooh. She does love Rock. of Ages.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.283
Or you could make your own video-

02:22.343 --> 02:25.051
something romantic and personal
with real production value.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.114
I got some pretty choice equipment
back at the house.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.683
- I'd be happy to help.
- Would you really?

02:28.749 --> 02:30.695
- Yeah!
- Yes!

02:30.751 --> 02:32.253
Great! Let's do it!

02:32.319 --> 02:34.731
Luke, buddy, I'll pick you up later.
We can go check out some wheels.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.826
I thought you were gonna
stay and watch the game.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.530
I knew you loved me.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.095
Oh, get out!

02:41.162 --> 02:42.368
- Come on.
- Wheels?

02:42.429 --> 02:44.534
What, are you looking at cars already?

02:44.598 --> 02:46.908
Pottery wheels.
I have to pick a spring elective...

02:46.967 --> 02:49.948
and Dad thinks I should take ceramics
'cause lots of girls do.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.711
You know what a lot of girls don't do?

02:51.772 --> 02:53.445
Guys who take ceramics.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.544
You got a wood shop at your school?

02:55.609 --> 02:58.317
I can't really build stuff.
I mostly take apart and apologize.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.087
- You gotta know how to build things.
- I can build suspense.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.150
- How?
- Well, get this.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.999
- Huh?
- Garage. Now.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.126
What's a bridal store?

03:12.193 --> 03:15.731
It's a place with the most wonderful dresses
that you have ever seen.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.298
We're gonna get you the perfect one...

03:17.364 --> 03:20.208
even if it take us all day.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.803
Found it.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.906
Oh, no, sweetie. That's a costume.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.451
- You can't wear a costume to a wedding.
- Why not?

03:26.507 --> 03:29.113
Belle was a princess.
She faced the Beast.

03:29.176 --> 03:32.180
She stood up to the townspeople.
What have you done?

03:32.246 --> 03:36.490
I... got us into that
tiny, little parking spot.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.531
Princess dresses
are not the only pretty dresses.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.329
I want to be a princess.
I want to be a princess!

03:42.389 --> 03:43.891
Stop that right now.

03:43.958 --> 03:45.938
Your dads want you to have
a flower girl dress...

03:45.993 --> 03:47.495
and that's what we're going to get you.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.131
So march.

03:50.464 --> 03:54.276
It was marked "compact,"
and we're driving a minivan, so-

03:54.335 --> 03:56.372
Hey, thanks
for inviting us to this.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.974
Oh, no problem. You know,
I'm surprised that this particular foursome...

03:59.039 --> 04:00.780
doesn't hang out more often,
considering-

04:00.841 --> 04:02.582
We're the cultured ones in the family?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.680
I wouldn't say that...
outside this group.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.826
Did you know your father
actually goes to the grocery store to buy books?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.452
I did know that, yeah.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.191
I also know that the best way
to get my sister to fall asleep is to-

04:13.254 --> 04:15.700
Show her a movie with subtitles.
Bonne nuit, Maman.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.430
We should be nice and grateful
that we have this day to spend together...

04:18.492 --> 04:20.301
in our own private salon.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.365
Don't tell my mom that.
She'll show up and ask to get her roots done.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.569
- Manny!
- That's true though.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.909
- Thanks, Manny.
- I am so excited for this exhibit.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.144
I'm such an admirer of Kandinsky.

04:33.207 --> 04:36.518
You know, he was credited with painting
the first truly abstract work.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.181
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.226
To be honest, I was a little nervous
about holding my own with those three...

04:41.282 --> 04:44.422
so-
I did a little boning up on Kandinsky.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.398
Figured it couldn't hurt
to have a few facts in my pocket.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.333
My backup plan was to touch a painting
and get thrown out.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.565
Yes, hi. Excuse me. Can you tell us
where the Kandinsky exhibit is?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.938
You know, Wassily Kandinsky?
Born in Moscow? Son of a tea merchant.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.876
I'm sorry.
That exhibit was temporary. it's closed.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.879
What? No.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.846
Oh, I love this Matisse.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.577
You know, this is one
of his final works.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.915
His failing health
led to his exploration of paper cutouts.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.148
Ah, yes. I believe he called it
"painting with scissors."

05:10.210 --> 05:12.281
And he was also
a contemporary of Picasso.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.917
You can definitely see how
they influenced each other. Right, Cam?

05:14.982 --> 05:19.328
Huh? Uh, well, you know,
it really reminds me... of, uh, Kandinsky.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.663
- How so?
- Well, not so much in look, more in texture.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.464
- No, Cam!
- No, please, sir, don't touch the art.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.766
- Sorry. I'll leave the premises.
- No, it's- it's fine.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.397
Just take a few steps back.

05:30.631 --> 05:35.808
Beth, I would swim the deepest,
sharkiest oceans to be with you.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.974
- What are you doing?
- Cut!

05:38.038 --> 05:40.109
Well, now we have a blooper reel.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.484
We're making a video love letter
for Andy's girlfriend.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.217
Your dad uses his computer
to put in cool backgrounds...

05:45.279 --> 05:47.850
while I act out all the things
that I would do to be with her...

05:47.915 --> 05:50.395
like swim an ocean or climb a mountain.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.557
Ooh, how about you buy a plane ticket
and visit her like a normal person?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.657
I would, but the coast guard
keeps her really busy.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.600
Eyes. Does she like it?

05:57.658 --> 06:01.800
She's probably so lonely with only two other
women to talk to in her whole 40-person unit.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.571
So you're saying it's just your girlfriend
and 36 super-in-shape dudes?

06:05.632 --> 06:07.578
Thirty-seven.
And it's not what you think.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.114
The coast guard
seriously frowns on fraternizing.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.480
- It's forbidden.
- Oh. That doesn't make it hot.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.112
I got some on your face. You're gonna shine.
I'll go get some of my- Claire's powder.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.746
My Claire. She's my wife.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.950
I thought you had a date to go on.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.119
I do.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.992
- When's he gonna get here?
- Whenever he does.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.861
He's just, like, a few minutes late.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.797
I'm sorry.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.767
That is so rude.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.327
A real man would be more considerate
of your time.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.032
You're right.

06:35.095 --> 06:38.474
That's why every year People magazine
names the consideratest man alive.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.672
Oh, man.
You can make fun of me all you want...

06:41.735 --> 06:44.841
but when you grow up,
you'll see what qualities make up a real man.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.612
- Someone say "makeup"?
- I did.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.449
All right. Here we go.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.889
Oh, yeah. Much better. You know what?
I think I'm gonna shadow down here.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.222
Gloria, you are gonna love this one.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.788
I think we have finally found
the perfect dress.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.356
Ta-da.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.132
It's nice, but I don't like the bow.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.694
Let's try more.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.001
We've tried on six dresses already.
She's fine with this.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.871
- Right, Lily?
- I don't care.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.501
See? She loves it. Done.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.239
Go try the lace one.

07:14.301 --> 07:17.976
- Seriously?
- This is endless.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.711
Why are you dragging this out?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.810
'Cause we haven't found the right dress.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.855
You have got to be
a better shopper than this.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.016
I have seen you buy three outfits
while driving a car.

07:26.079 --> 07:29.185
Come on. it's fun.
I don't have any daughters.

07:29.249 --> 07:32.753
All I get to buy is tuxedos,
and they all look the same.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.926
But don't tell Manny that
because I don't want to hear another lecture.

07:35.989 --> 07:40.096
It's funny. I have never cared about
any of this stuff.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.333
I didn't even wear a wedding dress
when I married Phil.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.899
Never even tried one on.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.105
Easy. That is the reaction for when
there's a man behind me with a gun.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.205
All I said is I don't care about
wedding dresses.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.409
Because you've never been in one.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.510
- I'm gonna pick some for you to try.
- Okay, no, no.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.351
- No need. Mm-mmm.
- Come on. You'll feel beautiful.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.449
Then you can go back
to your... boy clothes.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.925
Hey.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.928
Bought this shirt for Luke,
and I couldn't return it.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.861
And I don't have all day
to try on dresses.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.523
Oh, and I do?

08:07.588 --> 08:10.034
It'll be fun for me.
You're my stepdaughter.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.467
I'm older than you.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.734
You see? it's already fun.

08:14.795 --> 08:18.004
We're gonna start
by building a simple toolbox.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.204
First, I'm gonna show you
how to cut the wood.

08:20.267 --> 08:23.476
I know you're a little young for this, goober.
Try to soak it all up.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.312
- What is this thing?
- Table vise.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.818
♪ Table vise, ta- ♪

08:27.875 --> 08:30.583
No. I already went
through this with Mitchell.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.282
That's what we're here to prevent.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.256
Didn't your dad teach you
any of this stuff?

08:34.313 --> 08:36.419
He says the only tool you need
is a sense of humor.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.554
'Cause who needs the Jaws of Life
if you have a good knock-knock joke?

08:39.620 --> 08:42.361
Luke, grab the goggles
over there, please.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.027
And try to pay attention.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.971
We measure twice, and we cut once.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.269
Hey, Grandpa, can you bench 180 pounds?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.071
I just said pay attention.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.907
And that's actually 205 with the bar.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.969
I'll lift that for you later.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.645
- I can see you're not gonna let up about that.
- Eh, I'm okay.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.086
Spot me.
Now, if this thing goes south...

09:04.144 --> 09:06.249
I want you to call 911 ...

09:06.313 --> 09:08.691
and tell Joe his old man died
as he lived-

09:08.749 --> 09:10.524
saving a trainload of people.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.128
All right. That's enough for now.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.570
Whoa.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.666
Tell me everything you know about women.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.444
Yeah, that last thing. Funny. Funny.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.179
Funny. I must be
a little behind you guys.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.221
His words.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.787
- Do you feel what's happening here?
- I feel pinching.

09:39.846 --> 09:43.692
No. I'm the weak link of this super group.
They know it and I know it.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.320
It's fine when we're all
in a big group...

09:45.385 --> 09:48.730
but once we're separated from the herd,
the hooves come out.

09:48.789 --> 09:52.999
- Don't you mean "claws"?
- Clawed animals don't travel in herds, Mitchell.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.540
Packs, flocks and prides.
Why can't we be on a farm?

09:55.596 --> 09:58.167
I'd make you all look like such idiots.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.507
You know what?
I'm just gonna wait outside.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.912
No. Cam, come on. You're being silly.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.316
To be perfectly honest,
I-I really needed Cam to stay.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.786
The minute he goes, I'm the dumb one.

10:09.843 --> 10:14.553
I-i took an art history class once, but that was
just to look at naked Italian dudes, so-

10:14.615 --> 10:16.788
Remember now,
you're in subzero temperatures.

10:16.850 --> 10:20.229
The only thing keeping you warm
is the heat of your fiery passion.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.530
And... go!

10:23.590 --> 10:25.092
- My beautiful Beth-
- Colder!

10:25.158 --> 10:26.865
My b-b-beautiful B-Beth.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.429
Colder!

10:28.495 --> 10:31.066
- That's too cold. That's too cold.
- B-B-Beth!

10:31.131 --> 10:32.838
Now we're talking!

10:32.899 --> 10:35.175
- You're so beautiful to me!
- Yes!

10:35.235 --> 10:37.511
Why am I so intent on helping Andy?

10:37.571 --> 10:40.381
I love filmmaking, and I love love.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.148
I guess you could say
I enjoy making love on film...

10:43.210 --> 10:45.850
and now I don't have to do it by myself.

10:45.912 --> 10:49.621
Beth, this is my long way
of saying I miss you.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.789
This- Uh- You know, this is weird.
I don't really know where to look.

10:52.853 --> 10:57.233
No, it's not weird. Just look deep into my eyes
and sweep me off my feet.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.792
All right.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.962
- Honey-
- Yeah, that's weird.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.134
- It is. Yeah.
- Haley, honey, can you help us?

11:04.197 --> 11:07.610
- I don't think anyone can.
- Just let Andy hold you Officer and a Gentleman style...

11:07.668 --> 11:10.205
and I'll superimpose Beth's face
over yours on the computer.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.308
- That's insane.
- I know. I can do anything with this.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.875
- If she's not comfortable-
- You know what, guys?

11:14.941 --> 11:16.943
This whole thing
is really sad and pathetic.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.513
No girl wants a guy
that tries this hard.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.025
If I got this video,
I'd call the police.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.494
Some girls actually like guys
who are nice to them.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.224
Some girls like 36 of them.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.926
- There's 37 of them!
- Okay, this is passion. We can use it.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.991
Andy, pick her up.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.129
- All right. Let's just get this over with.
- Oh, my gosh!

11:33.193 --> 11:34.934
He's actually picking me up! Dad!

11:34.995 --> 11:37.999
It's just for a minute.
Now lock eyes, and... action.

11:40.434 --> 11:44.507
Honey, this is my long way
of saying I miss you.

11:44.571 --> 11:48.280
I don't have to climb a mountain
or swim an ocean...

11:48.341 --> 11:50.651
to be with you...

11:50.711 --> 11:53.157
because you're always with me-

11:53.213 --> 11:59.027
in my thoughts, my dreams, my heart.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.761
You deserve more
than I could possibly ever give you...

12:02.823 --> 12:05.064
but everything I have is yours.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.700
I love you.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.067
Cut!

12:12.132 --> 12:14.806
That was beautiful. I really felt that one.
Did you feel that one?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.870
No, I didn't feel anything.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.781
- I was talking to Andy.
- I know! Put me down, freak!

12:19.840 --> 12:22.218
- Ugh!
- Wow.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.552
That really takes me back
to my cheerleading days.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.629
How could a guy with so much pain
create such hopeful imagery?

12:32.686 --> 12:35.724
I certainly couldn't paint like that
if my mother was dying of consumption.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.202
The last time she had a cold, I could barely
arrange the flowers on the front table.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.795
You know what I found so interesting?

12:40.861 --> 12:43.432
Was that the first painting
and the last painting were so similar...

12:43.497 --> 12:47.411
and I think that that was intentional,
a comment on the perpetual motion of life.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.141
The first painting was the last painting.
We walked in a circle.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.807
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.080
So, you know,
I'm gonna go check on Cam...

12:55.142 --> 12:57.383
- because he's been alone for quite some time.
- Mm-hmm.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.822
- And he's probably touching a painting.
- No, don't go!

12:59.880 --> 13:03.953
- We're having such a good time!
- I guess it's just you and me now.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.896
It was okay when Cam left
and passed the dunce cap to Mitchell...

13:06.953 --> 13:09.024
but with him gone, it went to me.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.365
What I would've given
to have Luke there.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.871
Ah, Luke.
Sweet as custard and just as smart.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.432
And presto.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.306
Thank you so much, Mr. Dunphy.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.403
- I wish I could repay you somehow.
- Nah.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.846
Next time you're with your girlfriend,
just think of me.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.781
Done.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.785
- Later.
- Who's that?

13:27.841 --> 13:30.549
- My date.
- Your lunch date? it's 5:00.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.614
He fell asleep.
But he texted me right when he woke up.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.024
Then you'd think he'd be well-rested enough
to walk to the front door.

13:36.082 --> 13:39.393
Yeah, a gentleman honks to support the troops,
not summon his girlfriend.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.695
Although my girlfriend is a troop,
so in my case, it's a little confusing.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.599
Oh, my God. it's still talking.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.069
Because it knows
you're not being respected.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.605
- Thank you.
- You bet.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.574
Ugh. You guys don't understand
how dating works in the real world.

13:50.630 --> 13:54.339
What are you talking about?
Look at everything Andy did for Beth today.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.938
I just live my life to make her happy.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.574
I'm gonna give this to the mailman,
who's gonna give it to the coast guard...

13:59.639 --> 14:01.380
and by this time tomorrow...

14:01.441 --> 14:04.752
someone in the coast guard's
gonna be giving it to my girlfriend.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.553
Can you imagine the smile on her face
when she takes it all in?

14:07.614 --> 14:11.926
Okay, I'm gonna go
while you two replay that in your minds.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.726
Oh, my gosh.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.831
Would you like to reenact Gravity?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.530
- Yes. Sandra Bullock!
- Oh. Dang it!

14:19.593 --> 14:21.231
Good call. That was quick.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.839
- Hey.
- "Hey"?

14:24.898 --> 14:27.435
That's what I get
after I waited for you all afternoon?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.480
Uh- You look good?

14:29.536 --> 14:32.608
I know that.
You were supposed to pick me up hours ago.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.245
You were, like, the first or second person
I texted after I woke up.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.789
Oh! That's so sweet.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.791
Did it even occur to you
to come to the door?

14:40.847 --> 14:42.986
Who comes to the door?

14:43.049 --> 14:46.826
A gentleman. Could you at least
open the car door for me?

14:49.589 --> 14:53.196
- Now can we go?
- You know what? Go take another nap.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.797
I'd rather wait for someone
who'd walk through a blizzard for me...

14:55.862 --> 14:57.967
and only honks to support the troops!

14:58.031 --> 14:59.772
I don't understand you.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.437
Neither do I!

15:06.006 --> 15:07.110
Ta-da.

15:07.173 --> 15:10.120
Claire, you look beautiful.
You're glowing.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.951
I'm not glowing. I'm sweating.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.653
Come on. Look at yourself in the mirror.

15:15.715 --> 15:20.289
Don't tell me that you don't feel
gorgeous and special.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.390
Wow.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.128
You're right.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.067
I am radiant.

15:26.126 --> 15:31.098
Oh, it's like I'm in a-
in a fairy tale or a dream.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.837
- Oh!
- Lies!

15:32.899 --> 15:34.674
You're faking it.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.237
I'm sorry! Look who raised me.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.784
I am my father's daughter.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.375
And also kind of his son.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.387
And I lied about that
being Luke's shirt.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.821
I bought it for myself in three colors.

15:45.879 --> 15:49.588
I am trying to help you out here, Gloria,
but this just isn't me.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.287
You did help me.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.262
I am glad I didn't have daughters.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.393
You know, at least when
I take Manny shopping, we make a day of it.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.927
I don't even have to ask him to twirl
because he just does it.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.564
¡ Vamos, Lily!

16:02.629 --> 16:05.542
Lily?

16:05.598 --> 16:06.599
- Lily?
- Lily?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.168
Is she- No.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.736
- No?
- She's gone. She's gone.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.749
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

16:11.805 --> 16:13.944
No, the dress!

16:14.007 --> 16:15.077
- Lily?
- Lily?

16:15.141 --> 16:17.052
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:17.978 --> 16:19.651
I can't run in these shoes!

16:19.713 --> 16:22.751
I bet you wish
you had boy shoes now, huh? Lily?

16:22.816 --> 16:26.286
- Claire, stop!
- What?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.094
- Look!
- Oh, my God.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.969
Okay, run, run. Come on. Come on!

16:36.696 --> 16:38.733
She looks so happy.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.642
She does. Oh, she really does.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.874
They're gonna kill us.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.917
What sort of princess?

16:45.972 --> 16:49.613
The kind that dances with beasts
and won't marry Gaston.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.677
- Really?
- What?

16:50.744 --> 16:52.280
It's the only dress she likes.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.723
Lily wants to come to the wedding
as Belle.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.421
Makes sense. She went to Pepper's seder
as Dora the Explorer.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.859
- It's fine.
- Are you sure?

17:01.921 --> 17:04.731
Yes. Yes. As long as she's happy.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.295
A gay wedding is hardly the place to stop
someone from being who they want to be.

17:09.929 --> 17:12.967
- They said it's fine.
- Yay! I'm finally happy!

17:13.032 --> 17:15.945
- Mmm!
- What?

17:16.002 --> 17:18.608
- I saw you twirl.
- Oh, I did not.

17:18.671 --> 17:22.380
Yes, you did. Such a pretty girl.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.979
Shut up. You're a girl.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.752
How about that daughter of ours?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.225
- She marches to the beat of her own drum, huh?
- Yeah. Exactly.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.855
So why are we so concerned
what two nerdy teenagers think of us?

17:32.919 --> 17:35.923
Isn't the true mark of intelligence
being able to admit what you don't know?

17:35.989 --> 17:37.366
- Shh. Here comes Manny.
- Did he hear me?

17:37.424 --> 17:38.494
- I don't think so.
- Hey, guys.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.799
- Nothin'.
- Hey, what are you doing out here?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.999
You guys invited us
so we could spend the day together.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.272
It felt wrong that you two are out here
and I was in there all alone with Alex.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.142
- Couldn't keep up, could ya?
- She knows everything. She made a docent cry.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.273
- It's okay. We're faking it too.
- Well, duh.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.248
- There you guys are.
- Nothin'.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.685
- Uh, we were just headed back in.
- Yeah, I'm getting a second wind.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.245
Oh, no, no, no. That's okay.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.348
- What do you say we go check out some food trucks?
- Really?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.950
I'll go back in if you guys want,
but I'm actually really hungry.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.654
- Yeah. Whatever you want.
- Whatever you need.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.492
Thanks, guys.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.291
If I'm being honest,
I had to get out of there.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.132
I was exhausted
from having to dumb it down all day.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.866
Really? The neck?

18:14.928 --> 18:17.841
Yeah, a kiss on the neck
opens all kinds of doors.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.843
Last one.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.212
Great job, champ.
Who said you can't build anything?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.683
My dad, the police, a doctor.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.811
You got a gift. Trust me. Take shop.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.822
I think I'm gonna.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.381
Hey, how'd you get to know
so much about everything?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.553
From my dad, mostly. He taught me
how to use a drill, change a tire...

18:37.617 --> 18:40.496
fake an injury when a buddy asks you
to help him move.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.226
Everything a man needs to get by.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.234
I'm just glad I have someone
to pass it on to.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.600
- You've got Manny.
- Mmm.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.435
Manny came to me kind of fully cooked.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.498
And I was an idiot with Mitchell...

18:51.564 --> 18:54.511
and by the time this guy gets old enough,
who knows how much I'll remember?

18:54.567 --> 18:57.639
These are my prime wisdom-giving years.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.377
You got any more questions, Luke?

18:59.439 --> 19:01.544
Just one- Can I have a sip?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.714
- The beer? Sure. What the hell.
- Awesome. My first drink of beer.

19:04.777 --> 19:08.884
I remember the day I gave Mitchell
his first taste of beer.

19:08.948 --> 19:13.363
He winced and carried on like someone
was digging a bullet out of his leg.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.358
I couldn't take that moment
away from Phil.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.096
Hang on.
Wait a second. Let me see that.

19:19.159 --> 19:22.106
No, this beer's skunked.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.405
It's no good.
Damn fridge must be on the fritz again.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.376
Aw, man. Really?

19:27.433 --> 19:30.539
Sorry, buddy. it's probably time
to call your dad anyway, right?

19:30.603 --> 19:33.106
- Okay.
- Wait a second. I want to give you something.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.483
- But those are yours.
- What's a grandfather for...

19:35.542 --> 19:37.613
if he can't give his grandson
a couple of tools?

19:37.677 --> 19:40.658
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- Good job.

19:42.215 --> 19:45.719
Joe. I know you're all
about the boobs right now...

19:45.785 --> 19:49.597
but trust me- the neck.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.635
Don't let go!

19:53.693 --> 19:56.469
Don't worry, George Clooney! I won't!

19:56.529 --> 19:58.065
You're too handsome!

19:58.131 --> 20:01.374
Watch out for incoming space junk!

20:01.434 --> 20:03.175
From where?

20:03.236 --> 20:05.273
Your zipper's down.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.318
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah, it is. Just-

20:07.373 --> 20:10.320
- What's Andy doing here?
- They're making a video for his girlfriend.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.151
Yeah? What's it called, Dorks in Space?

20:12.212 --> 20:15.489
Oh, it was actually sweet. it's weird.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.221
There's something about him.
You know what I mean?

20:17.283 --> 20:19.627
Yeah, he's just like Dad.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.098
Ew. Ew, ew!

20:22.155 --> 20:23.930
In space, no one can hear you scream.

20:23.990 --> 20:24.991
What?

20:25.058 --> 20:28.198
In space, no one can hear you scream!

20:28.261 --> 20:30.639
- I can't hear you!
- In spa-

20:30.697 --> 20:33.439
- Oh, I just got it. That's good. That's good.
- Thank you.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.103
That's awesome.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.182
There's no denying it is original...

20:40.240 --> 20:42.242
but you can see
the influence of Pollock.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.879
While the pattern seems
haphazard and random...

20:44.944 --> 20:47.754
it belies a purposefulness,
an intentionality.

20:47.814 --> 20:52.126
You know, I think what I'm responding to
is the clashing juxtaposition of color...

20:52.185 --> 20:54.756
the bright yellow against
the dark background.

20:54.821 --> 20:58.997
It's like a ray of sunshine
in an otherwise bleak world.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.436
If I may take a contrary position-

21:01.494 --> 21:04.771
I think it speaks to the absurdity
and folly of human endeavor.

21:04.831 --> 21:05.935
Mmm.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.536
Like our futile struggle for perfection.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.582
I get it. I got mustard on my shirt.
Get over it.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.983
I know we're joking, but all kidding aside,
it really does remind me of Kandinsky's-
